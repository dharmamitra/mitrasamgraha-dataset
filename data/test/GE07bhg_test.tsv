adṛṣṭa pūrvam hṛṣitaḥ asmi dṛṣṭvā bhayena ca pravyathitam manaḥ me tat eva me darśaya deva rūpam prasīda deva īśa jagat nivāsa	After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.
kirīṭinam gadinam cakra hastam icchāmi tvām draṣṭum aham tathā eva tena eva rūpeṇa catuḥ bhujena sahasra bāho bhava viśva mūrte	O universal form, O thousand-armed Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see You in that form.
śrī bhagavān uvāca mayā prasannena tava arjuna idam rūpam param darśitam ātma yogāt tejaḥ mayam viśvam anantam ādyam yat me tvat anyena na dṛṣṭa pūrvam	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, happily have I shown you, by My internal potency, this supreme universal form within the material world. No one before you has ever seen this primal form, unlimited and full of glaring effulgence.
na veda yajña adhyayanaiḥ na dānaiḥ na ca kriyābhiḥ na tapobhiḥ ugraiḥ evam rūpaḥ śakyaḥ aham nṛ loke draṣṭum tvat anyena kuru pravīra	O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by charity, nor by pious activities, nor by severe penances can I be seen in this form in the material world.
mā te vyathā mā ca vimūḍha bhāvaḥ dṛṣṭvā rūpam ghoram īdṛk mama idam vyapeta bhīḥ prīta manāḥ punaḥ tvam tat eva me rūpam idam prapaśya	You have been perturbed and bewildered by seeing this horrible feature of Mine. Now let it be finished. My devotee, be free again from all disturbances. With a peaceful mind you can now see the form you desire.
sañjayaḥ uvāca iti arjunam vāsudevaḥ tathā uktvā svakam rūpam darśayām āsa bhūyaḥ āśvāsayām āsa ca bhītam enam bhūtvā punaḥ saumya vapuḥ mahā ātmā	Sañjaya said to Dhṛtarāṣṭra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, having spoken thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form and at last showed His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.
arjunaḥ uvāca dṛṣṭvā idam mānuṣam rūpam tava saumyam janārdana idānīm asmi saṁvṛttaḥ sa cetāḥ prakṛtim gataḥ	When Arjuna thus saw Kṛṣṇa in His original form, he said: O Janārdana, seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, I am now composed in mind, and I am restored to my original nature.
śrī bhagavān uvāca su durdarśam idam rūpam dṛṣṭavān asi yat mama devāḥ api asya rūpasya nityam darśana kāṅkṣiṇaḥ	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, this form of Mine you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form, which is so dear.
na aham vedaiḥ na tapasā na dānena na ca ijyayā śakyaḥ evam vidhaḥ draṣṭum dṛṣṭavān asi mām yathā	The form you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by charity, nor by worship. It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.
bhaktyā tu ananyayā śakyaḥ aham evam vidhaḥ arjuna jñātum draṣṭum ca tattvena praveṣṭum ca param tapa	My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.
mat karma kṛt mat paramaḥ mat bhaktaḥ saṅga varjitaḥ nirvairaḥ sarva bhūteṣu yaḥ saḥ mām eti pāṇḍava	My dear Arjuna, he who engages in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of fruitive activities and mental speculation, he who works for Me, who makes Me the supreme goal of his life, and who is friendly to every living being – he certainly comes to Me.
arjunaḥ uvāca evam satata yuktāḥ ye bhaktāḥ tvām paryupāsate ye ca api akṣaram avyaktam teṣām ke yoga vit tamāḥ	Arjuna inquired: Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are always properly engaged in Your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?
śrī bhagavān uvāca mayi āveśya manaḥ ye mām nitya yuktāḥ upāsate śraddhayā parayā upetāḥ te me yukta tamāḥ matāḥ	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect.
ye tu akṣaram anirdeśyam avyaktam paryupāsate sarvatra gam acintyam ca kūṭa stham acalam dhruvam sanniyamya indriya grāmam sarvatra sama buddhayaḥ te prāpnuvanti mām eva sarva bhūta hite ratāḥ	But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, unchanging, fixed and immovable – the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth – by controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all, at last achieve Me.
kleśaḥ adhika taraḥ teṣām avyakta āsakta cetasām avyaktā hi gatiḥ duḥkham deha vadbhiḥ avāpyate	For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.
ye tu sarvāṇi karmāṇi mayi sannyasya mat parāḥ ananyena eva yogena mām dhyāyantaḥ upāsate teṣām aham samuddhartā mṛtyu saṁsāra sāgarāt bhavāmi na cirāt pārtha mayi āveśita cetasām	But those who worship Me, giving up all their activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, having fixed their minds upon Me, O son of Pṛthā – for them I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.
mayi eva manaḥ ādhatsva mayi buddhim niveśaya nivasiṣyasi mayi eva ataḥ ūrdhvam na saṁśayaḥ	Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt.
atha cittam samādhātum na śaknoṣi mayi sthiram abhyāsa yogena tataḥ mām icchā āptum dhanam jaya	My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way develop a desire to attain Me.
abhyāse api asamarthaḥ asi mat karma paramaḥ bhava mat artham api karmāṇi kurvan siddhim avāpsyasi	If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.
atha etat api aśaktaḥ asi kartum mat yogam āśritaḥ sarva karma phala tyāgam tataḥ kuru yata ātma vān	If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness of Me, then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.
śreyaḥ hi jñānam abhyāsāt jñānāt dhyānam viśiṣyate dhyānāt karma phala tyāgaḥ tyāgāt śāntiḥ anantaram	If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind.
adveṣṭā sarva bhūtānām maitraḥ karuṇaḥ eva ca nirmamaḥ nirahaṅkāraḥ sama duḥkha sukhaḥ kṣamī santuṣṭaḥ satatam yogī yata ātmā dṛḍha niścayaḥ mayi arpita manaḥ buddhiḥ yaḥ mat bhaktaḥ saḥ me priyaḥ	One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me – such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.
yasmāt na udvijate lokaḥ lokāt na udvijate ca yaḥ harṣa amarṣa bhaya udvegaiḥ muktaḥ yaḥ saḥ ca me priyaḥ	He by whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by anyone, who is equipoised in happiness and distress, fear and anxiety, is very dear to Me.
anapekṣaḥ śuciḥ dakṣaḥ udāsīnaḥ gata vyathaḥ sarva ārambha parityāgī yaḥ mat bhaktaḥ saḥ me priyaḥ	My devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and not striving for some result, is very dear to Me.
yaḥ na hṛṣyati na dveṣṭi na śocati na kāṅkṣati śubha aśubha parityāgī bhakti mān yaḥ saḥ me priyaḥ	One who neither rejoices nor grieves, who neither laments nor desires, and who renounces both auspicious and inauspicious things – such a devotee is very dear to Me.
samaḥ śatrau ca mitre ca tathā māna apamānayoḥ śīta uṣṇa sukha duḥkheṣu samaḥ saṅga vivarjitaḥ tulya nindā stutiḥ maunī santuṣṭaḥ yena kenacit aniketaḥ sthira matiḥ bhakti mān me priyaḥ naraḥ	One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contaminating association, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn’t care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and who is engaged in devotional service – such a person is very dear to Me.
ye tu dharma amṛtam idam yathā uktam paryupāsate śraddadhānāḥ mat paramāḥ bhaktāḥ te atīva me priyāḥ	Those who follow this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engage themselves with faith, making Me the supreme goal, are very, very dear to Me.
arjunaḥ uvāca prakṛtim puruṣam ca eva kṣetram kṣetra jñam eva ca etat veditum icchāmi jñānam jñeyam ca keśava śrī bhagavān uvāca idam śarīram kaunteya kṣetram iti abhidhīyate etat yaḥ vetti tam prāhuḥ kṣetra jñaḥ iti tat vidaḥ	Arjuna said: O my dear Kṛṣṇa, I wish to know about prakṛti [nature], puruṣa [the enjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kuntī, is called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.
kṣetra jñam ca api mām viddhi sarva kṣetreṣu bhārata kṣetra kṣetra jñayoḥ jñānam yat tat jñānam matam mama	O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is My opinion.
tat kṣetram yat ca yādṛk ca yat vikāri yataḥ ca yat saḥ ca yaḥ yat prabhāvaḥ ca tat samāsena me śṛṇu	Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the field of activities is, and what his influences are.
ṛṣibhiḥ bahudhā gītam chandobhiḥ vividhaiḥ pṛthak brahma sūtra padaiḥ ca eva hetu madbhiḥ viniścitaiḥ	That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings. It is especially presented in Vedānta-sūtra with all reasoning as to cause and effect.
mahā bhūtāni ahaṅkāraḥ buddhiḥ avyaktam eva ca indriyāṇi daśa ekam ca pañca ca indriya go carāḥ icchā dveṣaḥ sukham duḥkham saṅghātaḥ cetanā dhṛtiḥ etat kṣetram samāsena sa vikāram udāhṛtam	The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten senses and the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions – all these are considered, in summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.
amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntiḥ ārjavam ācārya upāsanam śaucam sthairyam ātma vinigrahaḥ indriya artheṣu vairāgyam anahaṅkāraḥ eva ca janma mṛtyu jarā vyādhi duḥkha doṣa anudarśanam asaktiḥ anabhiṣvaṅgaḥ putra dāra gṛha ādiṣu nityam ca sama cittatvam iṣṭa aniṣṭa upapattiṣu mayi ca ananya yogena bhaktiḥ avyabhicāriṇī vivikta deśa sevitvam aratiḥ jana saṁsadi adhyātma jñāna nityatvam tattva jñāna artha darśanam etat jñānam iti proktam ajñānam yat ataḥ anyathā	Humility; pridelessness; nonviolence; tolerance; simplicity; approaching a bona fide spiritual master; cleanliness; steadiness; self-control; renunciation of the objects of sense gratification; absence of false ego; the perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease; detachment; freedom from entanglement with children, wife, home and the rest; even-mindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events; constant and unalloyed devotion to Me; aspiring to live in a solitary place; detachment from the general mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization; and philosophical search for the Absolute Truth – all these I declare to be knowledge, and besides this whatever there may be is ignorance.
jñeyam yat tat pravakṣyāmi yat jñātvā amṛtam aśnute anādi mat param brahma na sat tat na asat ucyate	I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. Brahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.
sarvataḥ pāṇi pādam tat sarvataḥ akṣi śiraḥ mukham sarvataḥ śruti mat loke sarvam āvṛtya tiṣṭhati	Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads and faces, and He has ears everywhere. In this way the Supersoul exists, pervading everything.
sarva indriya guṇa ābhāsam sarva indriya vivarjitam asaktam sarva bhṛt ca eva nirguṇam guṇa bhoktṛ ca	The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all the modes of material nature.
bahiḥ antaḥ ca bhūtānām acaram caram eva ca sūkṣmatvāt tat avijñeyam dūra stham ca antike ca tat	The Supreme Truth exists outside and inside of all living beings, the moving and the nonmoving. Because He is subtle, He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know. Although far, far away, He is also near to all.
avibhaktam ca bhūteṣu vibhaktam iva ca sthitam bhūta bhartṛ ca tat jñeyam grasiṣṇu prabhaviṣṇu ca	Although the Supersoul appears to be divided among all beings, He is never divided. He is situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that He devours and develops all.
jyotiṣām api tat jyotiḥ tamasaḥ param ucyate jñānam jñeyam jñāna gamyam hṛdi sarvasya viṣṭhitam	He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone’s heart.
iti kṣetram tathā jñānam jñeyam ca uktam samāsataḥ mat bhaktaḥ etat vijñāya mat bhāvāya upapadyate	Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge and the knowable have been summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly and thus attain to My nature.
prakṛtim puruṣam ca eva viddhi anādī ubhau api vikārān ca guṇān ca eva viddhi prakṛti sambhavān	Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.
kārya kāraṇa kartṛtve hetuḥ prakṛtiḥ ucyate puruṣaḥ sukha duḥkhānām bhoktṛtve hetuḥ ucyate	Nature is said to be the cause of all material causes and effects, whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world.
puruṣaḥ prakṛti sthaḥ hi bhuṅkte prakṛti jān guṇān kāraṇam guṇa saṅgaḥ asya sat asat yoni janmasu	The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.
upadraṣṭā anumantā ca bhartā bhoktā mahā īśvaraḥ parama ātmā iti ca api uktaḥ dehe asmin puruṣaḥ paraḥ	Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer, who is the Lord, the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known as the Supersoul.
yaḥ evam vetti puruṣam prakṛtim ca guṇaiḥ saha sarvathā vartamānaḥ api na saḥ bhūyaḥ abhijāyate	One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation. He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position.
dhyānena ātmani paśyanti kecit ātmānam ātmanā anye sāṅkhyena yogena karma yogena ca apare	Some perceive the Supersoul within themselves through meditation, others through the cultivation of knowledge, and still others through working without fruitive desires.
anye tu evam ajānantaḥ śrutvā anyebhyaḥ upāsate te api ca atitaranti eva mṛtyum śruti parāyaṇāḥ	Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth and death.
yāvat sañjāyate kiñcit sattvam sthāvara jaṅgamam kṣetra kṣetra jña saṁyogāt tat viddhi bharata ṛṣabha	O chief of the Bhāratas, know that whatever you see in existence, both the moving and the nonmoving, is only a combination of the field of activities and the knower of the field.
samam sarveṣu bhūteṣu tiṣṭhan tam parama īśvaram vinaśyatsu avinaśyantam yaḥ paśyati saḥ paśyati	One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies, and who understands that neither the soul nor the Supersoul within the destructible body is ever destroyed, actually sees.
samam paśyan hi sarvatra samavasthitam īśvaram na hinasti ātmanā ātmānam tataḥ yāti parām gatim	One who sees the Supersoul equally present everywhere, in every living being, does not degrade himself by his mind. Thus he approaches the transcendental destination.
prakṛtyā eva ca karmāṇi kriyamāṇāni sarvaśaḥ yaḥ paśyati tathā ātmānam akartāram saḥ paśyati	One who can see that all activities are performed by the body, which is created of material nature, and sees that the self does nothing, actually sees.
yadā bhūta pṛthak bhāvam eka stham anupaśyati tataḥ eva ca vistāram brahma sampadyate tadā	When a sensible man ceases to see different identities due to different material bodies and he sees how beings are expanded everywhere, he attains to the Brahman conception.
anāditvāt nirguṇatvāt parama ātmā ayam avyayaḥ śarīra sthaḥ api kaunteya na karoti na lipyate	Those with the vision of eternity can see that the imperishable soul is transcendental, eternal, and beyond the modes of nature. Despite contact with the material body, O Arjuna, the soul neither does anything nor is entangled.
yathā sarva gatam saukṣmyāt ākāśam na upalipyate sarvatra avasthitaḥ dehe tathā ātmā na upalipyate	The sky, due to its subtle nature, does not mix with anything, although it is all-pervading. Similarly, the soul situated in Brahman vision does not mix with the body, though situated in that body.
yathā prakāśayati ekaḥ kṛtsnam lokam imam raviḥ kṣetram kṣetrī tathā kṛtsnam prakāśayati bhārata	O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.
kṣetra kṣetra jñayoḥ evam antaram jñāna cakṣuṣā bhūta prakṛti mokṣam ca ye viduḥ yānti te param	Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal.
śrī bhagavān uvāca param bhūyaḥ pravakṣyāmi jñānānām jñānam uttamam yat jñātvā munayaḥ sarve parām siddhim itaḥ gatāḥ	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection.
idam jñānam upāśritya mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ sarge api na upajāyante pralaye na vyathanti ca	By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental nature like My own. Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation or disturbed at the time of dissolution.
mama yoniḥ mahat brahma tasmin garbham dadhāmi aham sambhavaḥ sarva bhūtānām tataḥ bhavati bhārata	The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata.
sarva yoniṣu kaunteya mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ tāsām brahma mahat yoniḥ aham bīja pradaḥ pitā	It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.
sattvam rajaḥ tamaḥ iti guṇāḥ prakṛti sambhavāḥ nibadhnanti mahā bāho dehe dehinam avyayam	Material nature consists of three modes – goodness, passion and ignorance. When the eternal living entity comes in contact with nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he becomes conditioned by these modes.
tatra sattvam nirmalatvāt prakāśakam anāmayam sukha saṅgena badhnāti jñāna saṅgena ca anagha	O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that mode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge.
rajaḥ rāga ātmakam viddhi tṛṣṇā saṅga samudbhavam tat nibadhnāti kaunteya karma saṅgena dehinam	The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kuntī, and because of this the embodied living entity is bound to material fruitive actions.
tamaḥ tu ajñāna jam viddhi mohanam sarva dehinām pramāda ālasya nidrābhiḥ tat nibadhnāti bhārata	O son of Bharata, know that the mode of darkness, born of ignorance, is the delusion of all embodied living entities. The results of this mode are madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.
sattvam sukhe sañjayati rajaḥ karmaṇi bhārata jñānam āvṛtya tu tamaḥ pramāde sañjayati uta	O son of Bharata, the mode of goodness conditions one to happiness; passion conditions one to fruitive action; and ignorance, covering one’s knowledge, binds one to madness.
rajaḥ tamaḥ ca abhibhūya sattvam bhavati bhārata rajaḥ sattvam tamaḥ ca eva tamaḥ sattvam rajaḥ tathā	Sometimes the mode of goodness becomes prominent, defeating the modes of passion and ignorance, O son of Bharata. Sometimes the mode of passion defeats goodness and ignorance, and at other times ignorance defeats goodness and passion. In this way there is always competition for supremacy.
sarva dvāreṣu dehe asmin prakāśaḥ upajāyate jñānam yadā tadā vidyāt vivṛddham sattvam iti uta	The manifestation of the mode of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illuminated by knowledge.
lobhaḥ pravṛttiḥ ārambhaḥ karmaṇām aśamaḥ spṛhā rajasi etāni jāyante vivṛddhe bharata ṛṣabha	O chief of the Bhāratas, when there is an increase in the mode of passion the symptoms of great attachment, fruitive activity, intense endeavor, and uncontrollable desire and hankering develop.
aprakāśaḥ apravṛttiḥ ca pramādaḥ mohaḥ eva ca tamasi etāni jāyante vivṛddhe kuru nandana	When there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, O son of Kuru, darkness, inertia, madness and illusion are manifested.
yadā sattve pravṛddhe tu pralayam yāti deha bhṛt tadā uttama vidām lokān amalān pratipadyate	When one dies in the mode of goodness, he attains to the pure higher planets of the great sages.
rajasi pralayam gatvā karma saṅgiṣu jāyate tathā pralīnaḥ tamasi mūḍha yoniṣu jāyate	When one dies in the mode of passion, he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities; and when one dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom.
karmaṇaḥ su kṛtasya āhuḥ sāttvikam nirmalam phalam rajasaḥ tu phalam duḥkham ajñānam tamasaḥ phalam	The result of pious action is pure and is said to be in the mode of goodness. But action done in the mode of passion results in misery, and action performed in the mode of ignorance results in foolishness.
sattvāt sañjāyate jñānam rajasaḥ lobhaḥ eva ca pramāda mohau tamasaḥ bhavataḥ ajñānam eva ca	From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, greed develops; and from the mode of ignorance develop foolishness, madness and illusion.
ūrdhvam gacchanti sattva sthāḥ madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ jaghanya guṇa vṛtti sthāḥ adhaḥ gacchanti tāmasāḥ	Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the abominable mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.
na anyam guṇebhyaḥ kartāram yadā draṣṭā anupaśyati guṇebhyaḥ ca param vetti mat bhāvam saḥ adhigacchati	When one properly sees that in all activities no other performer is at work than these modes of nature and he knows the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental to all these modes, he attains My spiritual nature.
guṇān etān atītya trīn dehī deha samudbhavān janma mṛtyu jarā duḥkhaiḥ vimuktaḥ amṛtam aśnute	When the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes associated with the material body, he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even in this life.
arjunaḥ uvāca kaiḥ liṅgaiḥ trīn guṇān etān atītaḥ bhavati prabho kim ācāraḥ katham ca etān trīn guṇān ativartate	Arjuna inquired: O my dear Lord, by which symptoms is one known who is transcendental to these three modes? What is his behavior? And how does he transcend the modes of nature?
śrī bhagavān uvāca prakāśam ca pravṛttim ca moham eva ca pāṇḍava na dveṣṭi sampravṛttāni na nivṛttāni kāṅkṣati udāsīna vat āsīnaḥ guṇaiḥ yaḥ na vicālyate guṇāḥ vartante iti evam yaḥ avatiṣṭhati na iṅgate sama duḥkha sukhaḥ sva sthaḥ sama loṣṭa aśma kāñcanaḥ tulya priya apriyaḥ dhīraḥ tulya nindā ātma saṁstutiḥ māna apamānayoḥ tulyaḥ tulyaḥ mitra ari pakṣayoḥ sarva ārambha parityāgī guṇa atītaḥ saḥ ucyate	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O son of Pāṇḍu, he who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present or long for them when they disappear; who is unwavering and undisturbed through all these reactions of the material qualities, remaining neutral and transcendental, knowing that the modes alone are active; who is situated in the self and regards alike happiness and distress; who looks upon a lump of earth, a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye; who is equal toward the desirable and the undesirable; who is steady, situated equally well in praise and blame, honor and dishonor; who treats alike both friend and enemy; and who has renounced all material activities – such a person is said to have transcended the modes of nature.
mām ca yaḥ avyabhicāreṇa bhakti yogena sevate saḥ guṇān samatītya etān brahma bhūyāya kalpate	One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.
brahmaṇaḥ hi pratiṣṭhā aham amṛtasya avyayasya ca śāśvatasya ca dharmasya sukhasya aikāntikasya ca	And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is immortal, imperishable and eternal and is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.
śrī bhagavān uvāca ūrdhva mūlam adhaḥ śākham aśvattham prāhuḥ avyayam chandāṁsi yasya parṇāni yaḥ tam veda saḥ veda vit	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is said that there is an imperishable banyan tree that has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.
adhaḥ ca ūrdhvam prasṛtāḥ tasya śākhāḥ guṇa pravṛddhāḥ viṣaya pravālāḥ adhaḥ ca mūlāni anusantatāni karma anubandhīni manuṣya loke	The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.

No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination one must cut down this strongly rooted tree with the weapon of detachment. Thereafter, one must seek that place from which, having gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything began and from whom everything has extended since time immemorial.
niḥ māna mohāḥ jita saṅga doṣāḥ adhyātma nityāḥ vinivṛtta kāmāḥ dvandvaiḥ vimuktāḥ sukha duḥkha saṁjñaiḥ gacchanti amūḍhāḥ padam avyayam tat	Those who are free from false prestige, illusion and false association, who understand the eternal, who are done with material lust, who are freed from the dualities of happiness and distress, and who, unbewildered, know how to surrender unto the Supreme Person attain to that eternal kingdom.
na tat bhāsayate sūryaḥ na śaśāṅkaḥ na pāvakaḥ yat gatvā na nivartante tat dhāma paramam mama	That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.

śarīram yat avāpnoti yat ca api utkrāmati īśvaraḥ gṛhītvā etāni saṁyāti vāyuḥ gandhān iva āśayāt	The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas. Thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another.
śrotram cakṣuḥ sparśanam ca rasanam ghrāṇam eva ca adhiṣṭhāya manaḥ ca ayam viṣayān upasevate	The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, eye, tongue, nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.
utkrāmantam sthitam vā api bhuñjānam vā guṇa anvitam vimūḍhāḥ na anupaśyanti paśyanti jñāna cakṣuṣaḥ	The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.
yatantaḥ yoginaḥ ca enam paśyanti ātmani avasthitam yatantaḥ api akṛta ātmānaḥ na enam paśyanti acetasaḥ	The endeavoring transcendentalists who are situated in self-realization can see all this clearly. But those whose minds are not developed and who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try.
yat āditya gatam tejaḥ jagat bhāsayate akhilam yat candramasi yat ca agnau tat tejaḥ viddhi māmakam	The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me.

yasmāt kṣaram atītaḥ aham akṣarāt api ca uttamaḥ ataḥ asmi loke vede ca prathitaḥ puruṣa uttamaḥ	Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person.
yaḥ mām evam asammūḍhaḥ jānāti puruṣa uttamam saḥ sarva vit bhajati mām sarva bhāvena bhārata	Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata.

One is called divine and the other demoniac. I have already explained to you at length the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac.
pravṛttim ca nivṛttim ca janāḥ na viduḥ āsurāḥ na śaucam na api ca ācāraḥ na satyam teṣu vidyate	Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.
asatyam apratiṣṭham te jagat āhuḥ anīśvaram aparaspara sambhūtam kim anyat kāma haitukam	They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control. They say it is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.
etām dṛṣṭim avaṣṭabhya naṣṭa ātmānaḥ alpa buddhayaḥ prabhavanti ugra karmāṇaḥ kṣayāya jagataḥ ahitāḥ	Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.

Thus until the end of life their anxiety is immeasurable. Bound by a network of hundreds of thousands of desires and absorbed in lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.

So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.” In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.
aneka citta vibhrāntāḥ moha jāla samāvṛtāḥ prasaktāḥ kāma bhogeṣu patanti narake aśucau	Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, they become too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and fall down into hell.

āsurīm yonim āpannāḥ mūḍhāḥ janmani janmani mām aprāpya eva kaunteya tataḥ yānti adhamām gatim	Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, O son of Kuntī, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.
tri vidham narakasya idam dvāram nāśanam ātmanaḥ kāmaḥ krodhaḥ tathā lobhaḥ tasmāt etat trayam tyajet	There are three gates leading to this hell – lust, anger and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.
etaiḥ vimuktaḥ kaunteya tamaḥ dvāraiḥ tribhiḥ naraḥ ācarati ātmanaḥ śreyaḥ tataḥ yāti parām gatim	The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kuntī, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.

tasmāt śāstram pramāṇam te kārya akārya vyavasthitau jñātvā śāstra vidhāna uktam karma kartum iha arhasi	One should therefore understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated.

tasmāt oṁ iti udāhṛtya yajña dāna tapaḥ kriyāḥ pravartante vidhāna uktāḥ satatam brahma vādinām	Therefore, transcendentalists undertaking performances of sacrifice, charity and penance in accordance with scriptural regulations begin always with oṁ, to attain the Supreme.
tat iti anabhisandhāya phalam yajña tapaḥ kriyāḥ dāna kriyāḥ ca vividhāḥ kriyante mokṣa kāṅkṣibhiḥ	Without desiring fruitive results, one should perform various kinds of sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat.

aśraddhayā hutam dattam tapaḥ taptam kṛtam ca yat asat iti ucyate pārtha na ca tat pretya na u iha	Anything done as sacrifice, charity or penance without faith in the Supreme, O son of Pṛthā, is impermanent. It is called asat and is useless both in this life and the next.

niścayam śṛṇu me tatra tyāge bharata sat tama tyāgaḥ hi puruṣa vyāghra tri vidhaḥ samprakīrtitaḥ	O best of the Bhāratas, now hear My judgment about renunciation. O tiger among men, renunciation is declared in the scriptures to be of three kinds.
yajña dāna tapaḥ karma na tyājyam kāryam eva tat yajñaḥ dānam tapaḥ ca eva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām	Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up; they must be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.
etāni api tu karmāṇi saṅgam tyaktvā phalāni ca kartavyāni iti me pārtha niścitam matam uttamam	All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Pṛthā. That is My final opinion.
niyatasya tu sannyāsaḥ karmaṇaḥ na upapadyate mohāt tasya parityāgaḥ tāmasaḥ parikīrtitaḥ	Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If one gives up his prescribed duties because of illusion, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.
duḥkham iti eva yat karma kāya kleśa bhayāt tyajet saḥ kṛtvā rājasam tyāgam na eva tyāga phalam labhet	Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome or out of fear of bodily discomfort is said to have renounced in the mode of passion. Such action never leads to the elevation of renunciation.
kāryam iti eva yat karma niyatam kriyate arjuna saṅgam tyaktvā phalam ca eva saḥ tyāgaḥ sāttvikaḥ mataḥ	O Arjuna, when one performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and renounces all material association and all attachment to the fruit, his renunciation is said to be in the mode of goodness.
na dveṣṭi akuśalam karma kuśale na anuṣajjate tyāgī sattva samāviṣṭaḥ medhāvī chinna saṁśayaḥ	The intelligent renouncer situated in the mode of goodness, neither hateful of inauspicious work nor attached to auspicious work, has no doubts about work.
na hi deha bhṛtā śakyam tyaktum karmāṇi aśeṣataḥ yaḥ tu karma phala tyāgī saḥ tyāgī iti abhidhīyate	It is indeed impossible for an embodied being to give up all activities. But he who renounces the fruits of action is called one who has truly renounced.
aniṣṭam iṣṭam miśram ca tri vidham karmaṇaḥ phalam bhavati atyāginām pretya na tu sannyāsinām kvacit	For one who is not renounced, the threefold fruits of action – desirable, undesirable and mixed – accrue after death. But those who are in the renounced order of life have no such result to suffer or enjoy.
pañca etāni mahā bāho kāraṇāni nibodha me sāṅkhye kṛta ante proktāni siddhaye sarva karmaṇām	O mighty-armed Arjuna, according to the Vedānta there are five causes for the accomplishment of all action. Now learn of these from Me.
adhiṣṭhānam tathā kartā karaṇam ca pṛthak vidham vividhāḥ ca pṛthak ceṣṭāḥ daivam ca eva atra pañcamam	The place of action [the body], the performer, the various senses, the many different kinds of endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul – these are the five factors of action.
śarīra vāk manobhiḥ yat karma prārabhate naraḥ nyāyyam vā viparītam vā pañca ete tasya hetavaḥ	Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or speech is caused by these five factors.
tatra evam sati kartāram ātmānam kevalam tu yaḥ paśyati akṛta buddhitvāt na saḥ paśyati durmatiḥ	Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the five factors, is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are.

jñānam jñeyam parijñātā tri vidhā karma codanā karaṇam karma kartā iti tri vidhaḥ karma saṅgrahaḥ	Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower are the three factors that motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer are the three constituents of action.
jñānam karma ca kartā ca tridhā eva guṇa bhedataḥ procyate guṇa saṅkhyāne yathā vat śṛṇu tāni api	According to the three different modes of material nature, there are three kinds of knowledge, action and performer of action. Now hear of them from Me.

buddheḥ bhedam dhṛteḥ ca eva guṇataḥ tri vidham śṛṇu procyamānam aśeṣeṇa pṛthaktvena dhanam jaya	O winner of wealth, now please listen as I tell you in detail of the different kinds of understanding and determination, according to the three modes of material nature.
pravṛttim ca nivṛttim ca kārya akārye bhaya abhaye bandham mokṣam ca yā vetti buddhiḥ sā pārtha sāttvikī	O son of Pṛthā, that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating, is in the mode of goodness.
yayā dharmam adharmam ca kāryam ca akāryam eva ca ayathā vat prajānāti buddhiḥ sā pārtha rājasī	O son of Pṛthā, that understanding which cannot distinguish between religion and irreligion, between action that should be done and action that should not be done, is in the mode of passion.
adharmam dharmam iti yā manyate tamasā āvṛtā sarva arthān viparītān ca buddhiḥ sā pārtha tāmasī	That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and religion to be irreligion, under the spell of illusion and darkness, and strives always in the wrong direction, O Pārtha, is in the mode of ignorance.
dhṛtyā yayā dhārayate manaḥ prāṇa indriya kriyāḥ yogena avyabhicāriṇyā dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha sāttvikī	O son of Pṛthā, that determination which is unbreakable, which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice, and which thus controls the activities of the mind, life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness.
yayā tu dharma kāma arthān dhṛtyā dhārayate arjuna prasaṅgena phala ākāṅkṣī dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha rājasī	But that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion, economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion, O Arjuna.
yayā svapnam bhayam śokam viṣādam madam eva ca na vimuñcati durmedhā dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha tāmasī	And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming, fearfulness, lamentation, moroseness and illusion – such unintelligent determination, O son of Pṛthā, is in the mode of darkness.
sukham tu idānīm tri vidham śṛṇu me bharata ṛṣabha abhyāsāt ramate yatra duḥkha antam ca nigacchati	O best of the Bhāratas, now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys, and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress.
yat tat agre viṣam iva pariṇāme amṛta upamam tat sukham sāttvikam proktam ātma buddhi prasāda jam	That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness.
viṣaya indriya saṁyogāt yat tat agre amṛta upamam pariṇāme viṣam iva tat sukham rājasam smṛtam	That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion.
yat agre ca anubandhe ca sukham mohanam ātmanaḥ nidrā ālasya pramāda uttham tat tāmasam udāhṛtam	And that happiness which is blind to self-realization, which is delusion from beginning to end and which arises from sleep, laziness and illusion is said to be of the nature of ignorance.
na tat asti pṛthivyām vā divi deveṣu vā punaḥ sattvam prakṛti jaiḥ muktam yat ebhiḥ syāt tribhiḥ guṇaiḥ	There is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems, which is freed from these three modes born of material nature.
brāhmaṇa kṣatriya viśām śūdrāṇām ca param tapa karmāṇi pravibhaktāni svabhāva prabhavaiḥ guṇaiḥ	Brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras are distinguished by the qualities born of their own natures in accordance with the material modes, O chastiser of the enemy.
śamaḥ damaḥ tapaḥ śaucam kṣāntiḥ ārjavam eva ca jñānam vijñānam āstikyam brahma karma svabhāva jam	Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness – these are the natural qualities by which the brāhmaṇas work.
śauryam tejaḥ dhṛtiḥ dākṣyam yuddhe ca api apalāyanam dānam īśvara bhāvaḥ ca kṣātram karma svabhāva jam	Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity and leadership are the natural qualities of work for the kṣatriyas.
kṛṣi go rakṣya vāṇijyam vaiśya karma svabhāva jam paricaryā ātmakam karma śūdrasya api svabhāva jam	Farming, cow protection and business are the natural work for the vaiśyas, and for the śūdras there are labor and service to others.
sve sve karmaṇi abhirataḥ saṁsiddhim labhate naraḥ sva karma nirataḥ siddhim yathā vindati tat śṛṇu	By following his qualities of work, every man can become perfect. Now please hear from Me how this can be done.
yataḥ pravṛttiḥ bhūtānām yena sarvam idam tatam sva karmaṇā tam abhyarcya siddhim vindati mānavaḥ	By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, a man can attain perfection through performing his own work.
śreyān sva dharmaḥ viguṇaḥ para dharmāt su anuṣṭhitāt svabhāva niyatam karma kurvan na āpnoti kilbiṣam	It is better to engage in one’s own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one’s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.
saha jam karma kaunteya sa doṣam api na tyajet sarva ārambhāḥ hi doṣeṇa dhūmena agniḥ iva āvṛtāḥ	Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kuntī, even if such work is full of fault.
asakta buddhiḥ sarvatra jita ātmā vigata spṛhaḥ naiṣkarmya siddhim paramām sannyāsena adhigacchati	One who is self-controlled and unattached and who disregards all material enjoyments can obtain, by practice of renunciation, the highest perfect stage of freedom from reaction.
siddhim prāptaḥ yathā brahma tathā āpnoti nibodha me samāsena eva kaunteya niṣṭhā jñānasya yā parā	O son of Kuntī, learn from Me how one who has achieved this perfection can attain to the supreme perfectional stage, Brahman, the stage of highest knowledge, by acting in the way I shall now summarize.
buddhyā viśuddhayā yuktaḥ dhṛtyā ātmānam niyamya ca śabda ādīn viṣayān tyaktvā rāga dveṣau vyudasya ca vivikta sevī laghu āśī yata vāk kāya mānasaḥ dhyāna yoga paraḥ nityam vairāgyam samupāśritaḥ ahaṅkāram balam darpam kāmam krodham parigraham vimucya nirmamaḥ śāntaḥ brahma bhūyāya kalpate	Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little, who controls his body, mind and power of speech, who is always in trance and who is detached, free from false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and acceptance of material things, free from false proprietorship, and peaceful – such a person is certainly elevated to the position of self-realization.
brahma bhūtaḥ prasanna ātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mat bhaktim labhate parām	One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.
bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaḥ ca asmi tattvataḥ tataḥ mām tattvataḥ jñātvā viśate tat anantaram	One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.
sarva karmāṇi api sadā kurvāṇaḥ mat vyapāśrayaḥ mat prasādāt avāpnoti śāśvatam padam avyayam	Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My pure devotee, under My protection, reaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace.
cetasā sarva karmāṇi mayi sannyasya mat paraḥ buddhi yogam upāśritya mat cittaḥ satatam bhava	In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.
mat cittaḥ sarva durgāṇi mat prasādāt tariṣyasi atha cet tvam ahaṅkārāt na śroṣyasi vinaṅkṣyasi	If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.
yat ahaṅkāram āśritya na yotsye iti manyase mithyā eṣaḥ vyavasāyaḥ te prakṛtiḥ tvām niyokṣyati	If you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will be falsely directed. By your nature, you will have to be engaged in warfare.
svabhāva jena kaunteya nibaddhaḥ svena karmaṇā kartum na icchasi yat mohāt kariṣyasi avaśaḥ api tat	Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction. But, compelled by the work born of your own nature, you will act all the same, O son of Kuntī.
īśvaraḥ sarva bhūtānām hṛt deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati bhrāmayan sarva bhūtāni yantra ārūḍhani māyayā	The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.
tam eva śaraṇam gaccha sarva bhāvena bhārata tat prasādāt parām śāntim sthānam prāpsyasi śāśvatam	O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.
iti te jñānam ākhyātam guhyāt guhya taram mayā vimṛśya etat aśeṣeṇa yathā icchasi tathā kuru	Thus I have explained to you knowledge still more confidential. Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish to do.
sarva guhya tamam bhūyaḥ śṛṇu me paramam vacaḥ iṣṭaḥ asi me dṛḍham iti tataḥ vakṣyāmi te hitam	Because you are My very dear friend, I am speaking to you My supreme instruction, the most confidential knowledge of all. Hear this from Me, for it is for your benefit.
mat manāḥ bhava mat bhaktaḥ mat yājī mām namaskuru mām eva eṣyasi satyam te pratijāne priyaḥ asi me	Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.
sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekam śaraṇam vraja aham tvām sarva pāpebhyaḥ mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ	Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.
idam te na atapaskāya na abhaktāya kadācana na ca aśuśrūṣave vācyam na ca mām yaḥ abhyasūyati	This confidential knowledge may never be explained to those who are not austere, or devoted, or engaged in devotional service, nor to one who is envious of Me.
yaḥ idam paramam guhyam mat bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati bhaktim mayi parām kṛtvā mām eva eṣyati asaṁśayaḥ	For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.
na ca tasmāt manuṣyeṣu kaścit me priya kṛt tamaḥ bhavitā na ca me tasmāt anyaḥ priya taraḥ bhuvi	There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.
adhyeṣyate ca yaḥ imam dharmyam saṁvādam āvayoḥ jñāna yajñena tena aham iṣṭaḥ syām iti me matiḥ	And I declare that he who studies this sacred conversation of ours worships Me by his intelligence.
śraddhā vān anasūyaḥ ca śṛṇuyāt api yaḥ naraḥ saḥ api muktaḥ śubhān lokān prāpnuyāt puṇya karmaṇām	And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful reactions and attains to the auspicious planets where the pious dwell.
kaccit etat śrutam pārtha tvayā eka agreṇa cetasā kaccit ajñāna sammohaḥ praṇaṣṭaḥ te dhanam jaya	O son of Pṛthā, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind? And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?
arjunaḥ uvāca naṣṭaḥ mohaḥ smṛtiḥ labdhā tvat prasādāt mayā acyuta sthitaḥ asmi gata sandehaḥ kariṣye vacanam tava	Arjuna said: My dear Kṛṣṇa, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have regained my memory by Your mercy. I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions.
sañjayaḥ uvāca iti aham vāsudevasya pārthasya ca mahā ātmanaḥ saṁvādam imam aśrauṣam adbhutam roma harṣaṇam	Sañjaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.
vyāsa prasādāt śrutavān etat guhyam aham param yogam yoga īśvarāt kṛṣṇāt sākṣāt kathayataḥ svayam	By the mercy of Vyāsa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism, Kṛṣṇa, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.
rājan saṁsmṛtya saṁsmṛtya saṁvādam imam adbhutam keśava arjunayoḥ puṇyam hṛṣyāmi ca muhuḥ muhuḥ	O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.
tat ca saṁsmṛtya saṁsmṛtya rūpam ati adbhutam hareḥ vismayaḥ me mahān rājan hṛṣyāmi ca punaḥ punaḥ	O King, as I remember the wonderful form of Lord Kṛṣṇa, I am struck with wonder more and more, and I rejoice again and again.
yatra yoga īśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ yatra pārthaḥ dhanuḥ dharaḥ tatra śrīḥ vijayaḥ bhūtiḥ dhruvā nītiḥ matiḥ mama	Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.
