yathā bhavadbhiḥ pṛṣṭo'haṃ vadanārthe mahātmabhiḥ | purāvṛttaṃ mayā proktaṃ śivārcanavidheḥ phalam | śivena dattaṃ sālūpyaṃ na gṛhītaṃ mayā tadā || 77 || yācitaṃ ca mayā śaṃbhorvadanaṃ vānarasya ca | śivena kṛpayā dattaṃ mama kāruṇyaśālinā || 78 || 	As he was told thus, he in his arrogance due to his might, asked me about my face in the same manner as I have been asked about my face by you noble-souled ones. The old story was recounted by me about the benefit of the holy rite of the worship of Śiva. “Sārūpya (having the same form as that of the lord) was granted by Śiva, but it was not accepted by me then. The face of a monkey was requested by me from Śaṃbhu. It was then granted to me kindly by Śiva who is by nature compassionate. 
nirābhimānino ye ca nirdabhā niṣparigrahāḥ | śaṃbhoḥ priyāste vijñeyā hyanye śivavabahiṣkṛtāḥ || 79 || 	Those who are devoid of false prestige, those who are free from arrogance and those who have no property or possessions, should be known as favourites of Śaṃbhu. Others are excluded by Śiva.” 
tathāvadanmayā sārddhaṃ rāvaṇastapaso balāt | mayā ca yācitānyeva daśa vaktrāṇi dhīmatā || 80 || 	80-86a. Then Rāvaṇa said to me: “On the strength of my penance, I had been sensible enough to request for ten heads.” 
upahāsakaraṃ vākyaṃ paulastyasya tadā surāḥ | mayā tadā hi śapto'sau rāvaṇo lokarāvaṇaḥ || 81 || 	At his derisive statement, Rāvaṇa who made the world scream, was cursed by me then: 
īdṛśānyeva vaktrāṇi yeṣāṃ vai saṃbhavaṃti hi | taiḥ sameto yadā ko'pi naravaryo mahātapāḥ | māṃ puraskṛtya sahasā haniṣyati na saṃśayaḥ || 82 || 	“When an excellent man of great penance accompanied by those who have faces like this (monkey faces like mine) (comes to your city) keeping me at the head, he will undoubtedly kill you.” 
evaṃ śapto mayā brahmanrāvaṇo lokarāvaṇaḥ | arcitaṃ kevalaṃ liṃgaṃ vinā tena mahātmanā || 83 || pīṭhikārūpasaṃsthena vinā tena surottamāḥ | viṣṇunā hi mahābhāgāstasmātsarvaṃ vidhāsyati || 84 || devadevo mahādevo viṣṇurūpī maheśvaraḥ | sarve yūyaṃ prārthayaṃtu viṣṇuṃ sarvaguhāśayam || 85 || 	Thus, O Brahmā, Rāvaṇa who made the world scream, was cursed by me. Only the Liṅga was worshipped by Ṛāvaṇa without the noble-souled Viṣṇu stationed in the form of the pedestal, O excellent Suras. Hence, O excessively fortunate ones, Maheśvara, Mahādeva, the lord of Devas, in the form of Viṣṇu will carry out everything. May all of you pray to Viṣṇu lying within the cavity of the heart of everyone. Therefore, I shall be at the head of all Devas. 
ahaṃ hi sarvadevānāṃ purovartī bhavāmyataḥ | te sarve naṃdino vākyaṃ śrutvā muditamānasāḥ | vaikuṃṭhamāgatā gīrbhirviṣṇuṃ stotuṃ pracakrire || 86 || 	86b. On hearing the words of Nandī, all of them became joyous in their minds. They came to Vaikuṇṭha and began to eulogize Viṣṇu by means of (good) words. 
devā ūcuḥ | namo bhagavate tubhyaṃ devadeva jagatpate | tvadādhāramidaṃ sarvaṃ jagadetaccarācaram || 87 || 	Devas said: 87. Obeisance to you, the lord, O lord of Devas, O lord of the universe. This entire universe consisting of mobile and immobile beings has you for its basis and support. 
etalliṃgaṃ tvayā viṣṇo dhṛtaṃ vai piṇḍirūpiṇā | mahāviṣṇusvarūpeṇa ghātitau madhukaiṭabhau || 88 || 	88. This Liṅga has been held by you, O Viṣṇu, in the form of the Piṇḍī (globular pedestal). In the form of Mahāviṣṇu (the demons) Madhu and Kaiṭabha were killed by you. 
tathā kamaṭharūpeṇa dhṛto vai maṃdarācalaḥ | varāharūpamāsthāya hiraṇyākṣo hatastvayā || 89 || 	89. Similarly, in the form of a tortoise, the Mandara mountain was held up and supported by you (at the time of churning of ocean for nectar). Assuming the form of a boar, Hiraṇyākṣa was killed by you. 
hiraṇyakaśipurdaityo hato nṛharirūpiṇā | tvayā caiva balirbaddho daityo vāmanarūpiṇā || 90 || 	90. Hiraṇyakaśipu, the Daitya, was killed by you by assuming the form of Nṛhari (Man-lion). Bali, the Daitya, was held and bound by you in the form of Vāmana (Dwarf). 
bhṛgūṇāmanvaye bhūtvā kṛtavīryātmajo hataḥ | itopyasmānmahāviṣṇo tathaiva paripālaya || 91 || 	91. The son of Kṛtavīrya (Sahasrārjuna) was killed by you after taking birth in the family of Bhṛgus. Hereafter too, O great Viṣṇu, protect us in the same manner. 
rāvamasya bhayādasmāttrātuṃ bhūyorhasi tvaram || 92 || 	92. It behoves you to protect us instantaneously from the fear of Rāvaṇa. 
evaṃ saṃprārthito devairbhagavānbhūtabhāvanaḥ | uvāca ca surānsarvānvāsudevo jaganmayaḥ || 93 || 	93. On being entreated thus by Devas, the lord Vāsudeva, the sanctifier (the creator) of all living beings, who is immanent in the universe, said to all those Suras: 
he devāḥ śrūyatāṃ vākyaṃ prastāvasadṛśaṃ mahat | śailādiṃ ca puraskṛtya sarve yūyaṃ tvarānvitāḥ | avatārānprakurvantu vānarīṃ tanumāśritāḥ || 94 || 	94. “O Devas, let this important statement he heard. It is relevant to this occasion. With Śailādi (Nandin) as your head (leader), all of you immediately take incarnations in the form (bodies) of monkeys. 
ahaṃ hi mānuṣo bhūtvā hyajñānena samāvṛtaḥ | saṃbhaviṣyāmyayodhyāyaṃ gṛhe daśarathasya ca | brahmavidyāsahāyosmi bhavatāṃ kāryasiddhaye || 95 || 	95. I shall become a human being enveloped by Ajñāna (Ignorance). I shall be born in Ayodhyā in the abode of Daśaratha for the attainment of your objectives. I am having Brahmavidyā (the knowledge of Brahman) as my assistant. 
janakasya gṛhe sākṣādbrahmavidyā janiṣyati | bhakto hi rāvaṇaḥ sākṣācchivadhyānaparāyaṇaḥ || 96 || 	96. Brahmavidyā herself will be born in the abode of Janaka.[7] In fact, Rāvaṇa is (my) devotee as he is directly engaged in the meditation on Śiva. 
tapasā mahatā yukto brahmavidyāṃ yadecchati | tadā susādhyo bhavati puruṣo dharmanirjitaḥ || 97 || 	97. When a man endowed with great penance desires for Brahmavidyā, he can be easily managed and won over by means of virtue.” 
evaṃ saṃbhāṣya bhagavānviṣṇuḥ paramamaṅgalaḥ | vālī cendrāṃśasaṃbhūtaḥ sugrīvoṃ śumataḥ sutaḥ || 98 || 	98-100. After saying this, lord Viṣṇu, the highly auspicious one (vanished). 
tathā brahmāṃśasaṃbhūto jāmbavānnṛkṣakuñjaraḥ | śilādatanayo naṃdī śivasyānucaraḥ priyaḥ || 99 || yo vai caikādaśo rudro hanūmānsa mahākapiḥ | avatīrṇaḥ sahāyārthaṃ viṣṇoramitatejasaḥ || 100 || 	Vālī was born of a part of Indra. Sugrīva was the son of the Sun. Jāmbavān, the leading Ṛkṣa (bear), was born of a part of Brahmā. Naṇḍī, the son of Śilāda, who was a favourite follower of Śiva, incarnated as the great monkey Hanūmān for rendering assistance to Viṣṇu of unmeasured splendour. 
maiṃdādayo'tha kapayaste sarve surasattamāḥ | evaṃ sarve suragaṇā avateruryathā tatham || 101 || 	101. The monkeys beginning with Mainda were all the excellent Suras. Thus, all Suras incarnated in a befitting manner. 
tathaiva viṣṇurutpannaḥ kauśalyānaṃdavarddhanaḥ | viśvasya ramaṇāccaiva rāma ityucyate budhaiḥ || 102 || 	102. Similarly, Viṣṇu was born as one who increased the delight of Kausalyā. He is called Rāma by learned men, because he pleased and gratified the entire universe. 
śeṣopi bhaktyā viṣṇośca tapasā'vātaradbhuvi || 103 || 	103. Due to his devotion to Viṣṇu, Śeṣa descended on the earth by means of the power of his penance. 
dordaṇḍāvapi viṣṇośca avatīrṇau pratāpinau | śatrughnabharatākhyau ca vikhyātau bhuvanatraye || 104 || 	104. The mighty arms of Viṣṇu incarnated as the valorous (Princes) named Śatrughṇa and Bharata well-renowned in the three worlds. 
mithilādhipateḥ kanyā yā uktā brahmavādibhiḥ | sā brahmavidyāvataratsurāṇāṃ kāryyasiddhaye | sītā jātā lāṃgalasya iyaṃ bhūmivikarṣaṇāt || 105 || 	105. She who was mentioned as Brahmavidyā by the expounders of the Vedas, incarnated as the daughter of the ruler of Mithilā for the fulfilment of the task of Suras. She was born from a furrow arising from the ploughing of the field with the ploughshare.[8] 
tasmātsīteti vikhyātā vidyā sānvīkṣikī tadā | mithilāyāṃ samutpannā maithitītyabhidhīyate || 106 || 	106. Hence, she became famous as Sītā. She was the Science of Metaphysics (personified). Since she was born in Mithilā, she is called Maithilī. 
janakasya kule jātā viśrutā janakātmajā | khyātā vedavatī pūrvaṃ brahmavidyāghanāśinī || 107 || 	107. She was born in the family of Janaka. Hence, she is well-known as Janakātmajā (Jānakī). This Brahmavidyā, the destroyer of sins, was formerly known as Vedavatī. 
sā dattā janakenaiva viṣṇave paramātmane || 108 || tayātha vidyayā sārddhaṃ devadevo jagatpatiḥ | ugre tapasi līno'sau viṣṇuḥ paramaduṣkaram || 109 || rāvaṇaṃ jetukāmo vai rāmo rājīvalocanaḥ | araṇyavāsamakaroddevānāṃ kāryasiddhaye || 110 || 	108-110. She was given by Janaka himself to Viṣṇu, the Supreme Soul. Along with her, the Vidyā (incarnated), Viṣṇu the greatest among the auspicious ones, the lord of Devas, the lord protector of the universe, became engaged in a severe penance. As he was desirous of defeating Rāvaṇa for the sake of the fulfilment of the task of Devas, the lotus-eyed Rāma stayed in forest (for the same purpose). 
śeṣāvatāro'pi mahāṃstapaḥ paramaduṣkaram | tatāpa parayā śaktyā devānāṃ kāryasiddhaye || 111 || 	111. Though the great incarnation of Śeṣa, (Lakṣmaṇa) performed an exceedingly difficult penance by means of his great Śakti (power), for the sake of the fulfilment of the task of Devas. 
śatrughno bharataścaiva tepatuḥ paramaṃ tapaḥ || 112 || tato'sau tapasā yuktaḥ sārddhaṃ tairdevatāgaṇaiḥ | sagaṇaṃ rāvaṇaṃ rāmaḥ ṣaḍbhirmāsairajīhanat | viṣṇunā ghātitaḥ śastraiḥ śivasārūpyamāptavān || 113 || sagamaḥ sa punaḥ sadyo baṃdhubhiḥ saha suvratāḥ || 114 || 	112-115. Śatrughna and Bharata too performed very great penance. Rāma who was thus endowed with the power of penance and was assisted and accompanied by those groups of Devas, killed Ṛāvaṇa along with his followers within six months. Killed by Viṣṇu by means of weapons, O sages of holy rites, he attained Sārūpya (having the same form as the god) of Śiva, along with his kinsmen and followers. By the grace of Śiva, he became (realized) the entire Dvaitādvaita (the essence of the philosophy of dualism and non-dualism).[9] Even the sages are deluded in the matter of discrimination between dualism and non-dualism. Men who are engaged in worshipping Śiva derive all those things. 
ye'rcayaṃti śivaṃ nityaṃ liṃgarūpiṇameva ca | striyo vāpyatha vā śūdrāḥ śvapacā hyaṃtyavāsinaḥ | taṃ śivaṃ prāpnuvaṃtyeva sarvaduḥkhopanāśanam || 116 || 	116. Those who continuously worship Śiva in the form of Liṅga, whether they be women or śūdras or cāṇḍālas or other low-caste people, do attain Śiva, the destroyer of all miseries. 
paśavo'pi paraṃ yātāḥ kiṃ punarmānuṣādayaḥ || 117 || ye dvijā brahmacaryeṇa tapaḥ paramamāsthitāḥ | varṣairanekairyajñānāṃ te'pi svargaparā bhavan || 118 || 	117-118. Even animals have attained the supreme lord. What then to say about human beings? The twice-born castes who have practised great penance observing the vow of celibacy and who have performed Yajñas for many years have attained (merely) Svarga (Heaven). 
jyotiṣṭomo vājapeyo hyatirātrādayo hyamī | yajñāḥ svargaṃ prayacchaṃti sattrīṇāṃ nātra saṃśayaḥ || 119 || tatra svargasukhaṃ bhuktvā puṇyakṣayakaraṃ mahat | puṇyakṣaye'pi yajvāno martyalokaṃ pataṃti vai || 120 || patitānāṃ ca saṃsāre daivādbuddhiḥ prajāyate | guṇatrayamayī viprāstāsutāstviha yoniṣu || 121 || 	119-123. There are many Yajñas[10] such as Jyotiṣṭoma, Vājapeya, Atirātra and so on. These Yajñas undoubtedly do bestow heavenly pleasures on those who perform them. After enjoying the heavenly pleasures, when their merits become exhausted, those sacrificers come back to the mortal world. Having descended to the world, they are born in the different species with their intellect of the nature of the three Guṇas of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Thus, many souls wander about in cycles of birth and death. By chance or as good luck would have it, some of them serve Śiva. 
śivadhyānaparāṇāṃ ca narāṇāṃ yatacetasām | māyānirasanaṃ sadyo bhaviṣyati na cānyathā || 124 || 	124. Instantaneous removal of Māyā takes place in the case of men who are engaged in regular meditation on Śiva and who have restrained their minds and not otherwise. 
māyānirasanātsadyo naśyatyeva guṇatrayam | yadā guṇatrayātīto bhavatīti sa muktibhāk || 125 || 	125. When Māyā is dispelled, the three Guṇas perish. Then a person transcends the three Guṇas and becomes liberated thereby. 
tasmālliṅgārcanaṃ bhāvyaṃ sarveṣāmapi dehinām | liṅgarūpī śivo bhūtvā trāyate saṃcarācaram || 126 || 	126-128. Hence, the worship of Liṅga should be thought of and pursued by all embodied beings. Śiva assumes the form of Liṅga and protects all mobile and immobile beings. 
purā bhavadbhiḥ pṛṣṭo'haṃ liṅgarūpī kathaṃ śivaḥ | tatsarvaṃ kathitaṃ viprā yāthātathyena saṃprati || 127 || 	Formerly I have been asked by you about how Śiva assumed the form of Liṅga. Everything has now been truthfully spoken (by me), O Brāhmaṇas. 
kathaṃ garaṃ bhakṣitavāñchivo lokamaheśvaraḥ | tatsarvaṃ śrūyatāṃ viprā yatāvatkathayāmi vaḥ || 128 || 	How Śiva, the great lord of the worlds, swallowed poison (Halāhala), may be listened to, O Brāhmaṇas, I shall recount it to you as it actually took place. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES: 
lomaśa uvāca | ekadā tu sabhāmadhya āsthito devarāṭ svayam | lokapālaiḥ parivṛto devaiśca ṛṣibhistathā || 1 || apsarogaṇasaṃvīto gaṃdharvaiśca puraskṛtaḥ | upagīyamānavijayaḥ siddhavidyādharairapi || 2 || 	1-2. On one occasion Indra, the lord of Devas, was seated in the middle of the assembly surrounded by the guardians of the worlds, Devas and Sages. He was encircled by bevies of celestial damsels and was honoured by Gandharvas. Songs in praise of his conquest were being sung by Siddhas and Vidyādharas. 
tadā śiṣyaiḥ parivṛto devarājaguruḥ sudhīḥ | āgato'sau mahābhāgo bṛhaspati rudāradhīḥ || 3 || 	3. At that time Bṛhaspati who was the scholarly preceptor of the king of Devas and was of exalted fortune and liberal-minded, came there surrounded by his disciples. 
taṃ dṛṣṭvā sahasā devāḥ praṇemuḥ samupasthitāḥ | iṃdropi dadṛśe tatra prāptaṃ vācaspatiṃ tadā || 4 || 	4. On seeing him Devas who had been sitting there promptly bowed down to him. Indra too had seen Vācaspati’s (Bṛhaspati’s) arrival. 
novāca kiṃciddurmedhāvaco mānupuraḥsaram | nāhvānaṃ nāsanaṃ tasya na visarjanameva ca || 5 || 	5. But the vicious-minded lord did not utter a single word in his honour. No word of welcome, no offer of seat, no formal permission to leave was accorded to him. 
śakraṃ pramattaṃ jñātvātha madādrājyasya durmatim | tirodhānamanuprāpto bṛhaspatī ruṣānvitaḥ || 6 || 	6. Knowing that Śakra had become arrogant and evil-minded due to royal authority, Bṛhaspati became angry and he vanished. 
gate devagurau tasminvimanaskā'bhavansurāḥ | yakṣā nāgāḥ sagaṃdharvā ṛṣayo'pi tathā dvijāḥ || 7 || 	7. When the preceptor of Devas had departed, Suras became dejected. Yakṣas, Serpents, Gandharvas and sages also became depressed in mind, O Brāhmaṇas. 
gāṃdharvasyā vasāne tu labdhasaṃjño hariḥ surān | papraccha tvaritenavai kva gato hi mahātapāḥ || 8 || 	8. At the end of the music recital, Indra (as it were) regained consciousness. He asked Suras immediately, “Where has (the preceptor) of great penance gone?” 
tadaiva nāradenoktaḥ śakro devādhipastathā | tvayā kṛtā hyavajñā ca gurornastyatra saṃśayaḥ || 9 || guroravajñayā rājyaṃ gataṃ te balasūdana | tasmātkṣamāpanīyo'sau sarvabhāvena hi tvayā || 10 || 	9-10. At the very same time, Śakra, the lord of Devas, was informed by Nārada: “The preceptor has been insulted by you. There is no doubt about it. O slayer of Bala, your kingdom has gone due to the disrespect (shown by you) to the preceptor. Hence, by all means, you have to plead to him for forgiveness.” 
etacchrutvā vacastasya nāradasya mahātmanaḥ | āsanātsahasotthāya taiḥ sarvaiḥ parivāritaḥ | āgacchattvarayā śakro gurorgehamataṃdritaḥ || 11 || 	11. On hearing these words of the noble-souled Nārada, Śakra suddenly got up from his seat. Surrounded by all of them (Devas etc.), he hastened to the abode of his preceptor promptly (without any slackness). 
pṛṣṭvā tārāṃ praṇamyādau kva gato hi mahātapāḥ | na jānāmītyuvācedaṃ tārā śakraṃ nirīkṣatī || 12 || 	12. He bowed down to Tārā at the outset and asked her, “Where has (our preceptor) of great penance gone?” Tārā stared at Śakra and said, “I do not know.” 
tadā ciṃtānvito bhūtvā śakraḥ svagṛhamāvrajat | etasminnaṃtare svarge hyaniṣṭāndbhutāni ca || 13 || abhavansarvaduḥkhārthe śakrasya ca mahātmanaḥ | pātālasthena balinā jñātaṃ śakrasya ceṣṭitam || 14 || 	13-15. Thereupon, Śakra became worried and returned to his own house. In the meantime, there appeared mysterious ill-omens in heaven, causing misery to everyone including the noble-minded Śakra himself. 
yayau daityaiḥ parivṛtaḥ pātālādamarāvatīm | tadā yuddhamatīvāsīddevānāṃ dānavaiḥ saha || 15 || 	All the activities of Śakra were known to Bali who was stationed in the nether worlds. Surrounded by Daityas, he went from Pātāla to Amarāvatī. Thereupon a great fight ensued between Devas and Dānavas. 
devāḥ parājitā daityai rājyaṃ śakrasya tatkṣaṇāt | saṃprāptaṃ sakalaṃ tasya mūḍhasya ca durātmanaḥ || 16 || nītaṃ sarvaprayatnena pātālaṃ tvaritaṃ gatāḥ | śukraprasādātte sarve tathā vijayino'bhavan || 17 || śakro'pi niḥśriko jāto devaistyaktastato bhṛśam | devī tirodhānagatā babhūva kamalekṣaṇā || 18 || 	16-18. Devas were defeated by Daityas. Instantaneously the whole of the kingdom of Śakra, the deluded and evil-minded one, was conquered by them and everything (belonging to Śakra) was quickly carried to Pātāla. It was by the grace of Śukra that all of them became victorious. Śakra became bereft of glory and splendour. So he was utterly abandoned by Devas. The goddess (of fortune) with lotus-like eyes vanished. 
airāvato mahānāgastathaivoccaiḥśravā hayaḥ | evamādīni ratnāni anekāni bahūnyapi | nītāni sahasā daityairlobhādasādhuvṛttibhiḥ || 19 || 	19. The great elephant Airāvata, the horse Uccaiḥśravas and many other precious things and jewels were taken away immediately by Daityas of evil behaviour due to greed. 
puṇyabhāṃji ca tānyeva patitāni ca sāgare | tadā sa vismayāviṣṭo balirāha guruṃ prati || 20 || 	20. The good ones among them fell into the ocean. Bali who was surprised at this, remarked to his preceptor: 
devānnirjitya cāsmābhirānītāni bahūni ca | ratnāni tu samudre'tha patitāni tadadbhutam || 21 || 	21. “It is mysterious that many jewels brought by us after defeating Devas have fallen into the ocean.” 
balestadvacanaṃ śrutvā uśanā pratyuvāca tam | aśvamedhaśatenaiva surarājyaṃ bhaviṣyati | dīkṣitasya na saṃdehastasmādbhokta sa eva ca || 22 || aśvamedhaṃ vinā kiṃcitsvargaṃ bhoktaṃ na pāryate || 23 || 	22-23. On hearing the words of Bali, Uśanas (i.e. Śukra) replied to him: “One can attain the heavenly kingdom only through performance of a hundred horse-sacrifices. There is no doubt about it that it will be acquired by one who is initiated in it. Hence, the enjoyer is also he himself. Without performing a horse-sacrifice, heavenly pleasures cannot at all be enjoyed.” 
gurorvacanamājñāya tūṣṇīṃbhūto balistataḥ | babhūva devaiḥ sārddhaṃ ca yathocitamakārayat || 24 || 	24. Understanding the utterance of his preceptor, Bali became quite silent. What was proper and befitting was carried out through and along with Devas. 
indropi śocyatāṃ prāpto jagāma parameṣṭhinam | vijñāpayāmāsa tathā sarvaṃ rājyabhayādikam || 25 || 	25. Indra too, on attaining a miserable plight, went to Parameṣṭhin (Brahmā) and informed him of everything, such as the danger to his kingdom and other things. 
śakrasya vacanaṃ śrutvā parameṣṭhī uvāca ha || 26 || saṃmilitvā surānsarvāṃstvayā sākaṃ tvarānvitāḥ | ārādhanārthaṃ gacchāmo viṣṇuṃ sarveśvareśvaram || 27 || 	26-28. On hearing the words of Śakra, Parameṣṭhī said: “We shall gather together all the Suras and go immediately along with you to Viṣṇu, the lord of all lords, in order to propitiate him.” 
tatheti gatvā te sarve śakrādyā lokapālakāḥ | brahmāṇaṃ ca puraskṛtya taṭaṃ kṣīrārṇavasya ca | prāpyopaviśya te sarve hariṃ stotuṃ pracakramuḥ || 28 || 	Saying “So be it” all those guardians of the worlds beginning with Śakra went to the shore of the Milk Ocean with Brahmā at their head. After sitting there all of them began to eulogize Hari. Brahmā said: 
brahmovāca | devadeva jagānnātha surāsuranamaskṛta | puṇyaślokāvyayānaṃta paramātmannamo'stu te || 29 || 	29-31. O lord of the universe, O lord of Devas bowed down to by Suras as well as Asuras, obeisance to you, O great Ātman, of auspicious reputation, O infinite one, O immutable one, free from decay. 
yajño'si yajñarūpo'si yajñāṃgo'si ramāpate | tato'dya kṛpayā viṣṇo devānāṃ varado bhava || 30 || 	You yourself are Yajña. You are of the form of Yajña, O consort of Lakṣmī. Hence, be the bestower of boons unto the Devas. 
guroravajñayā cādya bhraṣṭarājyaḥ śatakratuḥ | jātaḥ surarṣibhiḥ sākaṃ tasmādenaṃ samuddhara || 31 || 	By insulting his preceptor, Indra has lost (everything) from his kingdom along with the celestial sages. Hence redeem him. 
śrībhagavānuvāca | dukokalajñayā sarvaṃ nasyatīti kimadbhutam | ye pāpino hyadharmiṣṭhāḥ kevalaṃ viṣayātmakāḥ | pitarau niṃditau yaiśca nirdaivātvena saṃśayaḥ || 32 || 	The Lord said: 32. There is no wonder in the fact that everything perishes by insulting the preceptor. Those who are sinners, who are completely engaged in evil activities, who indulge only in sensual pleasures and by whom parents are censured, are undoubtedly godless ones. 
anena yatkṛtaṃ brahmansadyastatphalamāgatam | karmaṇā cāsya śakrasya sarveṣāṃ saṃkaṭāgamaḥ || 33 || 	33. Immediately he has acquired the fruit, O Brahmā, of what he has committed. Difficulty and misfortune have befallen all due to the act of this Śakra. 
viparīto yadā kālaḥ puruṣasya bhavettadā | bhūtamaitrīṃ prakurvaṃti sarvakāryārthasiddhaye || 34 || 	34. When a person faces adverse circumstances, they say that, he must be friendly with all living beings in order to achieve all his purposes. 
tena vai kāraṇeneṃdra madīyaṃ vacanaṃ kuru | kāryahetostvayā kāryo daityaiḥ saha samāgamaḥ || 35 || 	35. For that reason, Indra, do as I suggest. For the realization of your purpose, alliance should be formed by you with Daityas. 
evaṃ bhagavatādiṣṭaḥ śakraḥ paramabuddhimān | amarāvatīṃ yayau hitvā sutalaṃ daivataiḥ saha || 36 || 	36. On being commanded by the lord, the highly intelligent Śakra left Amarāvatī and went to Sutala along with Devas. 
indraṃ samāgataṃ śrutvā iṃdraseno ruṣānvitaḥ | babhūva saha sainyena haṃtukāmaḥ puraṃdaram || 37 || 	37. On seeing that Indra had come, Indrasena became furious. Along with his army, he was desirous of killing Indra. 
nāradena tadā daityā baliśca balināṃ varaḥ | nivāritastadvadhācca vākyairuccāvacaistathā || 38 || 	38. Then by means of different types of (consoling) words, Daityas and Bali, the most excellent one among strong persons, were prevented from killing him by Nārada. 
ṛṣestasyaiva vacanāttyaktamanyurbalistadā | babhūva saha sainyena āgato hi śatakratuḥ || 39 || indrasenena dṛṣṭo'sau lokapālaiḥ samāvṛtaḥ | uvāca tvarayā yuktaḥ prahasanniva daityarāṭ || 40 || 	39-40. At the instance of that same sage, Bali controlled (abandoned) his anger. Indra then came in along with his array. He was seen by Indrasena surrounded by the guardians of the worlds. The king of Daityas hastened to tell him laughingly: 
kasmādihāgataḥ śakra sutalaṃ prati kathyatām | tasyaitadvacanaṃ śrutvā smayamāna uvācatam || 41 || 	41. “Wherefore have you come here to Sutala, O Śakra? Let it be mentioned.” On hearing these words, he said smilingly: 
vayaṃ kaśyapadāyādā yūyaṃ sarve tathaiva ca | yathā vayaṃ tathā yūyaṃ vigraho hi nirarthakaḥ || 42 || 	42. “We are the descendants of Kaśyapa. All of you are also so. Just as we are, so also you are. Clash and quarrel is meaningless. 
mama rājyaṃ kṣaṇenaiva nītaṃ daivavaśāttavayā | tathā hyetāni tānyena ratnāni subahūnyapi | gatāni tatkṣaṇādeva yatnānītāni vai tvayā || 43 || 	43. As fate would have it, my kingdom was seized by you instantaneously. So also many gems were taken away by you. Though brought with very great effort, they too have gone. 
tasmādvimarśaḥ kartavyaḥ puruṣeṇa vipaścitā | vimarśajjāyate jñānaṃ jñānānmokṣo bhaviṣyati || 44 || 	44. Hence a learned person must deliberate and ponder. One gets knowledge by means of deliberation and liberation originates from knowledge. 
kiṃ tu me bata uktena jāne na ca tavāgrataḥ | śaraṇārthī hyahaṃ prāptaḥ suraiḥ saha tavāṃtikam || 45 || 	45. But alas! of what avail is my utterance in front of you? I do not know. I have approached you along with Suras as a person seeking refuge.” 
etacchrutvā tu śakrasya vākyaṃ vākyavidāṃ varaḥ | prahasyovāca matimāñchakraṃ prati vidāṃ varaḥ || 46 || 	46. On hearing these words of Śakra, the intelligent (Daitya), the most excellent one among knowers (learned), the most excellent one among those who know what to say, said laughingly to Śakra: 
tvamāgatosi deveṃdra kimarthaṃ tanna vedmayaham || 47 || 	47. “For what purpose, O Devendra, you have come, I do not know.” 
śakrastadvacanaṃ śrutvā hyaśrupūrṇākulekṣaṇaḥ | kiṃcinnovāca tatrainaṃ nārado vākyamabravīt || 48 || 	48. On hearing those words, Śakra’s eyes became filled with tears. He did not say anything. Nārada spoke to him the following words: 
bale tvaṃ kiṃ na jānāsi kāryākāryavicāraṇām | dharmo hi mahatāmeṣa śaraṇāgatapālanam || 49 || 	49. “O Bali, don’t you know the difference between right and wrong activities? This is the virtue of great men. They protect those who seek refuge in them. 
śaraṇāgataṃ ca vipraṃ ca rogiṇaṃ vṛddhameva ca | yaetānna ca rakṣaṃti te vai brahmahaṇo narāḥ || 50 || 	50. Those who do not protect the one who seeks refuge, a Brāhmaṇa, a sick man and an old man, are (really) slaughterers of Brāhmaṇas. 
śaraṇāgataśabdena āgatastava sannidhau | saṃrakṣaṇāya yogyaśca tvayā nāstyatra saṃśayaḥ | evamukto nāradena tadā daityapatiḥ svayam || 51 || vimṛśya parayā buddhyā kāryākāryavicāraṇām | śakraṃ prapūjayāmāsa bahumānapuraḥsaram | lokapālaiḥ sametaṃ ca tathā suragaṇaiḥ saha || 52 || 	51-52. He has come to your presence with words asking for refuge. He is worthy of being protected by you. There is no doubt in this matter.” On being told thus by Nārada, the lord of Daityas himself pondered over everything with great understanding regarding what was right and what was wrong. With great respect, he honoured Śakra along with the guardians of the worlds as well as the groups of Devas. 
pratyayārthaṃ ca sattvāni hyanekāni vratāni vai | balipratyayabhūtāni sa cakāraḥ puraṃdaraḥ || 53 || 	53. For the sake of credence, Puranadara performed many good holy observances of the Sāttvika quality which created confidence in Bali. 
evaṃ sa samayaṃ kṛtvā śakraḥ svārthaparāyaṇaḥ | balinā saha cāvāsīdarthaśāstraparo mahān || 54 || 	54. Thus Śakra entered into an agreement with Bali in order to further his selfish ends. That great lord stayed with Bali solely devoting himself to the (precepts in the) science of political economy. 
evaṃ nivasatastasya sutale'pi śatakratoḥ | vatsarā bahavo hyāsaṃstadā buddhimakalpayat | saṃsmṛtya vacanaṃ viṣṇorvimṛśya ca punaḥpunaḥ || 55 || 	55. Thus Indra passed many years living in Sutala. Remembering the words of Viṣṇu and pondering over them again and again, he thought of a plan. 
ekadā tu sabhāmadhya āsīno devarāṭsvayam | uvāca prahasanvākyaṃ balimuddiśya nītimān || 56 || 	56. Once the king of Devas himself was sitting in the middle of the assembly (of Bali). Conversant with the right policy, he spoke laughingly these words to Bali: 
prāptavyāni tvayā vīra asmākaṃ ca tvayā bale | gajādīni bahūnyeva ratnāni vividhāni ca || 57 || gatāni tatkṣaṇādeva sāgare patitāni vai | prayatno hi prakartavyo hyasmābhistvayānvitaiḥ || 58 || 	57-58. “Many gems and jewels, elephants etc. have dropped into the ocean, while you were bringing them here. They belonged to us then. They should be recovered from the ocean by you as well as by us, O heroic one. 
teṣāṃ coddharaṇe daitya ratnānāmiha sāgarāt | tarhi nirmathanaṃ kāryaṃ bhavatā kāryasiddhaye || 59 || 	59. We must hurry up in exerting ourselves to recover those jewels from the ocean. Hence, it must be churned by you for the purpose of achieving the desired result.” 
baliḥ pravartitastena śakreṇa surasūdanaḥ | uvāca śakraṃ tvaritaḥ kenedaṃ mathanaṃ bhavet || 60 || 	60. Induced thus by Śakra, Bali, the slayer of Suras, spoke to Śakra immediately, “By whom and with what should the churning be done?” 
tadā nabhogatā vāṇī meghagaṃbhīraniḥsvanā | uvāca devā daityāśca maṃthadhvaṃ kṣīrasāgaram || 61 || bhavatāṃ balavṛddhiśca bhaviṣyati na saṃśayaḥ || 62 || maṃdaraṃ caiva maṃthānaṃ rajjuṃ kuruta vāsukim | paścāddevāśca daityāśca melayitvā vimathyatām || 63 || 	61-63. Then an ethereal voice with the majestic rumbling sound of cloud said: “O Devas, O Daityas, do churn the Ocean of Milk. There is no doubt about this that your strength will increase. Make the Mandara mountain the churning rod and Vāsuki the requisite rope. Afterwards, O Devas and Daityas, join together and let the ocean be churned.” 
nabhogatāṃ ca tāṃ vāṇīṃ niśamyātha tadāḥsurāḥ | daityaiḥ sārddhaṃ tataḥ sarva udyamaṃ cakrurudyatāḥ || 64 || 	64. On hearing the words of that ethereal voice, all Suras exerted themselves along with Daityas. 
pātālānnirgatāḥ sarve tadā te'tha surāsurāḥ | ājagmuratulaṃ sarve maṃdaraṃ parvatottamam || 65 || 	65. Those Suras and Asuras came out of Pātāla. They all came to the matchless, excellent mountain Mandara. 
daityāśca koṭisaṃkhyākāstathā devā na saṃśayaḥ | udyuktāḥ sahasā prā'yurmaṃdaraṃ kanakaprabham || 66 || 	66. Daityas were ten million in number. So also were Devas undoubtedly. Preparing themselves, they came to Mandara having golden lustre. 
saratnaṃ vartulākāraṃ sthūlaṃ caiva mahāprabham | anekaratnasaṃvītaṃ nānādrumaniṣevitam || 67 || caṃdanaiḥ pārijātaiśca nāgapunnāgacaṃpakaiḥ | nānāmṛgagaṇākīrṇaṃ siṃhaśārdūlasevitam || 68 || 	67-68. It abounded in gems and precious stones. It was globular in shape. It was very big and exceedingly lustrous. Many gems were (lying scattered) all round. It had many trees such as sandal tree, Pārijāta, Nāga, Punnāga and Caṃpaka. It was full of various kinds of animals and deer, lions and tigers. 
mahāśailaṃ dṛṣṭvā te surasattamāḥ | ūcuḥ prāṃjalayaḥ sarve tadā te surasattamāḥ || 69 || 	69. On seeing such a great mountain, all the excellent Suras, joined their palms in reverence and said: Devas said: 
devā ūcuḥ | adre surā vayaṃ sarve vijñaptumiha cāgatāḥ | tacchṛṇuṣva mahāśaila pareṣāmupakārakaḥ || 70 || 	"70. O mountain, all of us, the Suras have come here to submit to you. ""Listen to it, O great mountain, the helper of others. "
evamuktastadā śailo davairdaityaiḥ sa maṃdaraḥ | uvāca niḥsṛto bhūtvā paraṃ vigrahavānvacaḥ || 71 || tena rūpeṇa rūpī sa parvato maṃdarācalaḥ | kimarthamāgatāḥ sarve matsamīpaṃ taducyatām || 72 || 	71-72. On being requested thus by Devas and Daityas then, the mountain Mandara came out in an embodied form and ia that form the mountain Mandara said: “What for have all of you come to me? Let that be mentioned.” 
tadā baliruvācedaṃ prastāvasadṛśaṃ vacaḥ | iṃdropi tvarayā yukto babhāṣe sūnṛtaṃ vacaḥ || 73 || 	73. Then Bali said these words befitting the occasion. Indra too hurriedly spoke these courteous and sincere words: 
asmābhiḥ saha kāryārthe bhava tvaṃ maṃdarācala | amṛtotpādanārthe tvaṃ maṃthānaṃ bhava suvrata || 74 || 	74. “O mountain Mandara, you cooperate with us in a great undertaking. O observer of holy vows, you should be the churning rod for the production of nectar.” 
tatheti matvā tadvākyaṃ devānāṃ kāryasiddhaye | ūce devāsurāṃścedamindraṃ prati viśeṣataḥ || 75 || 	75. Saying “So be it” and honouring their words, because it was for the accomplishment of the task of Devas, he spoke these words to Devas and Asuras and particularly to Indra: 
cheditau ca tvayā pakṣau vajreṇa śataparvaṇā | gaṃtuṃ kathaṃ samartho'haṃ bhavatāṃ kāryasiddhaye || 76 || 	76. “My wings have been cut (by you) with the thunderbolt of hundred spikes. How is it possible for me to go for realizing your purpose?” 
tadā devāsurāḥ sarve stūyamānā mahācalam | utpāṭayeyuratulaṃ maṃdaraṃ ca tatodbhutam || 77 || 	77. Then all Devas and Asuras praised the mountain. They then uprooted that incomparable and wonderful Mandara mountain. 
kṣīrārṇavaṃ netukāmā hyaśaktāste tato'bhavan | parvataḥ patitaḥ sadyo devadaityopari dhruvam || 78 || 	78. But, though they were desirous of taking it to the Milky Ocean, they proved incapable of doing it. The mountain fell on Devas and Daityas. 
kecidbhagnā mṛtāḥ kecitkecinmūrchāparā bhavan | parīvādaratāḥ kecitkecitkleśatvamāgatāḥ || 79 || 	79. Some were crushed. Softie died. Some fell into a swoon. Some of them began to blame and censure and some suffered great pain. 
ेvaṃ bhagnodyamā jātā asurāḥsuradānavāḥ | cetanāṃ paramāṃ prāptāstuṣṭuvurjagadīśvaram || 80 || 	80. Thus, Asuras, Suras and Dānavas failed in their attempt. When they regained consciousness, they eulogized the Lord of the universe: 
rakṣarakṣa mahāviṣṇo śaraṇāgatavatsala | tvayā tatamidaṃ sarvaṃ jaṃgamājaṃgamaṃ ca yat || 81 || 	81. “Save us, save us, O great Viṣṇu, O lord compassionate to those who seek refuge. The entire world, mobile as well as immobile, is pervaded by you.” 
devānāṃ kāryasiddhyarthaṃ prādurbhūto haristadā | tāndṛṣṭvā sahasā viṣṇurgaruḍopari saṃsthitaḥ || 82 || līlayā parvataśreṣṭhamuttabhyāropayatkṣaṇāt | garutmati tadā devaḥ sarveṣāmabhayaṃ dadau || 83 || 	82-83. Then Hari appeared before them for the accomplishment of the purpose of Devas. Viṣṇu who was seated on Garuḍa, saw them and suddenly and sportingly lifted up the excellent mountain and placed it on Garuḍa.[1] Then, the lord granted all of them protection from fear. 
tata utthāya tāndevānkṣīrosyottaraṃ taṭam | nītvā taṃ parvataṃ vṛddhaṃ nikṣipyāpsu tato yayau || 84 || 	84. Rising from there (and taking leave of) those Devas, he took the old mountain to the northern shore of the Ocean of Milk. After placing it in the waters, he went away from that place. 
tadā sarve suragaṇāḥ svāgatya asuraiḥ saha | vāsukiṃ ca samādāya cakrire samayaṃca tam || 85 || 	85. Then all those groups of Suras arrived there along with Asuras, taking Vāsuki with them. Then they made the agreement. 
maṃthānaṃ maṃdaraṃ caiva vāsukiṃ rajjumeva ca | kṛtvā surā'surāḥ sarve mamaṃthuḥ śrīrasāgaram || 86 || 	86. After making Mandara the churning rod and Vāsuki the rope, all of them, Suras and Asuras, churned the Ocean of Milk. 
kṣīrābdhermathyamānasya parvato hi rasātalam | gataḥ sa tatkṣaṇādeva kūrmo bhūtvā ramāpatiḥ | uddhṛtastatkṣaṇādeva tadadbhutamivābhavat || 87 || 	87. As the Ocean of Milk was being churned, the mountain sank deep into Rasātala. At that very instant, the Lord of Ramā, Viṣṇu, became a tortoise and lifted it up. That was something really marvellous. 
bhrāmyamāṇastataḥ śailo noditaḥ suradānavaiḥ | bhramamāṇo nirādhāro bodhaśceva guruṃ vinā || 88 || 	88. When the mountain rotated, it was further pulled and pushed by Suras and Dānavas. Now it rotated without any basis, like the understanding without a preceptor. 
paramātmā tadā viṣṇurādhāro maṃdarasya ca | dorbhiścaturbhiḥ saṃgṛhya mamaṃthābdhiṃ sukhāvaham || 89 || 	89. Viṣṇu, the supreme soul, then became the basic support of the Mandara mountain. With his four hands he gathered it up and churned pleasantly. 
tadā surāsurāḥ sarve mamaṃthuḥ kṣīrasāgaram | ekībhūtvā balenaivamatimātraṃ balotkaṭāḥ || 90 || 	90. Then all Suras and Asuras churned the Ocean of Milk after uniting together. Very powerful themselves, by uniting together, they became all the more powerful. 
pṛṣṭhakaṃṭhorujānvaṃtaḥ kamaṭhasya mahātmanaḥ | tathāsau parvataśreṣṭho vajrasāramayo dṛḍhaḥ | ubhayorgharṣaṇādeva vaḍavāgniḥ samutthitaḥ || 91 || 	91. The excellent mountain had adamantine strength. It rolled on the back, neck, thighs and the space between the knees of the noble-souled tortoise. Due to the friction of these two, submarine fire was generated. 
halāhalaṃ ca saṃjātaṃ tadṝṣṭvā nāradena hi | tato devānuvācedaṃ devarṣiramitadyutiḥ || 92 || 	92. The Halāhala poison too emerged and it was seen by Nārada. Thereafter, the celestial sage of unmeasured splendour spoke these words: 
na kāryaṃ mathanaṃ cābdherbhavadbhiradhunā'khilaiḥ | prārthayadhvaṃ śivaṃ devāḥ sarve dakṣasya yājanam | tadvismṛtiṃ ca voyātaṃ vīrabhadreṇa yatkṛtam || 93 || 	93-94, “The churning of the ocean should not be carried on by you all now. O Devas, all of you pray to Śiva.[2] Have you forgotten the sacrifice of Dakṣa and what Vīrabhadra did there? 
tasmācchivaḥ smaryatāṃ cāśu devāḥ paraḥ parāṇāmapi vā paraśca | parātparaḥ paramānaṃdarūpo yogidhyeyo niṣprapaṃco hyarūpaḥ || 94 || 	Hence, let Śiva be immediately remembered, O Devas. He is greater than the greatest; he is beyond the greatest. He is the embodiment of supreme bliss. He is worthy of being meditated upon by Yogins; he has no form. (As a matter of fact) however, he is formless and unmanifest (or without diversity).” 
te mathyamānāstvaritā devāḥ svātmārthasādhakāḥ | abhilāṣaparāḥ sarve na śrṛṇvaṃti yato jaḍāḥ || 95 || 	95. Devas were eager to achieve their purpose. Therefore, they hurriedly went on churning the ocean. All those who are overwhelmed by desires do not listen (to the advice of others), because they become irrational and stupid. 
upadeśaiśca bahubhirnopadeśyāḥ kadācana | te rāgadveṣasaṃghātāḥ sarve śivaparāṅmukhāḥ || 96 || 	96. They should not be given many pieces of advice and instructions. They are subject to Rāga (desire) and Dveṣa (hatred). All of them are averse to Śiva. 
kevalodyamasaṃvītā mamaṃthuḥ kṣīrasāgaram | atinirmathanājjātaṃ kṣīrābdheścahalāhalam || 97 || 	97. With their sheer continuous exertion, they churned the Ocean of Milk. Due to excessive churning, the poison called Halāhala was generated from the Ocean of Milk.[3] 
trailokyadahane prauḍhaṃ prāptaṃ haṃtuṃ divaukasaḥ | ata ūrdhvaṃ diśaḥ sarvā vyāptaṃ kṛtsnaṃ nabhastalam | grasituṃ sarvabhūtānāṃ kālakūṭaṃ samabhyayāt || 98 || 	98. It was strong enough to burn down the three worlds. It came up to kill the heaven-dwellers. It went up still further and spread to all quarters. The entire sky was pervaded by it. The Kālakūṭa poison advanced to consume all the living beings. 
dṛṣṭvā bṛhaṃtaṃ svakarasthamojasā taṃ sarparājaṃ saha parvatena | tatraiva hitvāpayayustadānīṃ palāyamānā hyasuraiḥ sametāḥ || 99 || 	99. They observed the huge king of serpents grasped by their own hands. They left him there along with the mountain and then went (immediately) away. They fled along with Asuras. 
tathaiva sarva ṛṣayo bhṛgvādyāḥ śataśāmyati | dakṣasya yajanaṃ tena yathā jātaṃ tathābhavat || 100 || 	100. So also the sages beginning with Bhṛgu, sages in hundreds (fled in all directions). It was like what happened at the sacrifice of Dakṣa. 
satyalokaṃ gatāḥ sarve bhuguṇā noditā bhṛśam | vedavākyaiśca vividhaiḥ kālakūṭaṃ śataśastataḥ | devā nāstyatra saṃdehaḥ satyaṃ satyaṃ vadāmi vaḥ || 101 || 	101. Earnestly urged by Bhṛgu, all of them went to Satyaloka: “This poison Kālakūṭa will be quelled by means of various Vedic Sentences. O Devas, there is no doubt in this matter. It is true; I am speaking the truth unto you.” 
bhṛguṇoktaṃ vacaḥ śrutvā kālakūṭaviṣārdditāḥ | satyalokaṃ samāsādya brahmāṇaṃ śaraṇaṃ yayuḥ || 102 || 	102. On hearing these words uttered by Bhṛgu, all of them distressed by the poison Kālakūṭa went to Satyaloka and sought refuge in Brahmā. 
tadā jājvalyamānaṃ vai kālakūṭaṃ prabhojjavalam | dṛṣṭvā brahmātha tāndṛṣṭvā hyakarmajñānasurāsurān | teṣāṃ śapitumārebhe nāradena nivāritaḥ || 103 || 	103. Brahmā saw the blazing Kālakūṭa with sparkling lustre. He found that Suras and Asuras were ignorant of their duties. He was about to curse them, but he was prevented by Nārada. 
brahmovāca | akāryaṃ kiṃ kṛtaṃ devāḥ kasmātkṣobhoyamudyataḥ | īśvarasya ca jāto'dya nānyathā mama bhāṣitam || 104 || 	Brahmā said: 104. O Devas, what a wrong thing has been committed by you? Why has this explosive thing cropped up? It is Īśvara’s anger. My speech cannot be otherwise. 
tato devaiḥ parivṛto vedopaniṣadaistathā | nānāgamaiḥ parivṛtaḥ kālakūṭabhayādyayau || 105 || 	105. Thereupon, surrounded by Devas, the Vedas, the Upāniṣads and the different kinds of Āgamas, he proceeded ahead out of fear of the Kālakūṭa. 
tataściṃtānvitā devā idamūcuḥ parasparam | avidyākāmasaṃvītāḥ kuryāmaḥ śaṃkaraṃ ca kam || 106 || 	106. Then, Devas who were worried said to to one another, “We are enveloped in Avidyā (nescience) and lust. How can we do anything to Śaṅkara?” 
brahmāṇaṃ ca puraskṛtya tadā devāstvarānvitāḥ | vaikuṇṭhamāvrajansarve kālakūṭa bhayārdditāḥ || 107 || 	107. Then Devas kept Brahmā at their head and hurriedly went to Vaikuṇṭha, because they were afraid of Kālakūṭa. 
brahmādayaścarṣigaṇāśca tadā pareśaṃ viṣṇuṃ purāṇapuruṣaṃ prabhaviṣṇumīśam | vaikuṇṭhamāśritamadhokṣajamādhavaṃ te sarve surāsuragaṇāḥ śaraṇaṃ prayātāḥ || 108 || 	108. Brahmā and others as well as the groups of sages sought refuge in the great lord Viṣṇu, the primordial Puruṣa, the mighty lord who had resorted to Vaikuṇṭha, Mādhava, Adhokṣaja. The groups of Suras and Asuras sought refuge in lord Viṣṇu. 
tāvatpravṛddhaṃ sumahatkālakūṭaṃ samabhyayāt | dagdhvādo brahmaṇo lokaṃ vaikuṇṭhaṃ ca dadāha vai || 109 || 	109. By that time, the great poison Kālakūṭa came there. After burning Brahmā’s world at the outset, it burned Vaikuṇṭha. 
kālakūṭāgninā dagdho viṣṇuḥ sarvaguhāśayaḥ | pārṣadaiḥ sahitaḥ sadyastamālasadṛśacchaviḥ || 110 || 	110. Viṣṇu who dwells in the cavity of the heart of everyone, was burned by the fire of Kālakūṭa also with his attendants. Immediately he acquired the colour of Tamāla. 
vaikuṇṭhaṃ ca sunīlaṃ ca sarvalokaiḥ samāvṛtam | jalakalmaṣasaṃvītāḥ sarve lokāstadābhavan || 111 || 	111. Vaikuṇṭha also became blue in colour. It was surrounded by all the worlds. Hence, all the worlds became encircled by the poisonous substance from the waters. 
aṣṭāvaraṇasaṃvītaṃ brahmāṃḍaṃ brahmaṇā saha | bhasmībhūtaṃ cakārāśu jalakalmaṣamadbhutam || 112 || 	112. The wonderful poison of the waters reduced to ash the whole of the Cosmic Egg with its eight outer coverings and along with Brahmā. 
nobhūmirna jalaṃ cāgnirna vāyurna nabhastadā | nāhaṃkāro na ca mahānmūlāvidyā tathaiva ca | śivasya kopātsaṃjātaṃ tadā bhasmākulaṃ jagat || 113 || 	113. There was no earth, no water, no fire, no wind, and no ether. There was neither Ahaṃkāra (Cosmic Ego), nor Mahat (the Great Principle). There was no Mūlāvidyā. On account of Śiva’s wrath, the entire universe became reduced to ash. Notes regarding the Churning of the Ocean: This is a favourite topic of Purāṇa-writers as can be seen from its description in Mbh, Ādi. 18, VR 1.45.17-18, BhP VIII.5.U-18, BdP I.ii.25, MtP 249-250 to mention a few. The background of the churning of the ocean is different in our text. It is for the recovery of the gems of Indra which were sunk into the sea that Devas and Asuras agreed to churn the ocean. In Mbh. it was god Nārāyaṇa who advised god Brahmā to churn the ocean for getting Amṛta (Ādi. 17.10-13). 
munaya ūcuḥ | yattvayā kathitaṃ brahmanbrahmāṃḍaṃ sacarācaram | bhasmībhūtaṃ rudrakopātkālakūṭāgninā'tha़khilam || 1 || 	The sages said: 1. O holy Sir, you said that the Cosmic Egg including the mobile and immobile beings was entirely reduced to ash by the fire of Kālakūṭa on account of the wrath of Rudra. 
brahmāṃḍāṃtarataḥ kiṃ tu rudraṃ manyāmahe vayam | tadā carācaraṃ naṣṭaṃ brahmaviṣṇupurogamam || 2 || bhasmībhūtaṃ rudrakopātkathaṃ sṛṣṭiḥ pravartitā | kuto brahmā ca viṣṇuśca kutaścaṃdrapurogamāḥ || 3 || anye surā surāḥ kutra bhasmībhūtā layaṃ gatāḥ | ata ūrdhvaṃ kimabhavattatsarvaṃ vaktumarhasi || 4 || 	2-4. But, we consider Rudra to be within the Cosmic Egg. Then the mobile and immobile beings with Brahmā and Viṣṇu as leaders were destroyed and reduced to ash through the wrath of Rudra. How was creation resumed and made to function? Wherefrom did Brahmā, Viṣṇu and other Suras and Asuras with the Moon at their Head (originate again)? Where did they get merged? Where were they reduced to ash? What happened after that? It behoves you to recount everything. 
vyāsaprasādātsakalaṃ vettha tvaṃ nāparo hi tat | tasmājjñānamayaṃ śāstraṃ tajjānāsi na cāparaḥ || 5 || 	5. By the grace of Vyāsa you know everything. No one else knows it. Hence you understand the holy scripture full of knowledge as no one else does. 
iti pṛṣṭastadā sarvairmunibhirbhāvitātmabhiḥ | sūto vyāsaṃ namaskṛtya vākyaṃ cedamathābravīt || 6 || 	6. Asked thus by all those sages of sanctified souls, Sūta bowed down to Vyāsa and spoke these words: 
lomaśa uvāca | yadā brahmāṃḍamadhyasthā vyāptā devā viṣāgninā | haribrahmādayo hyete lokapālāḥ savāsavāḥ | tadā vijñāpitaḥ śaṃbhurheraṃbena mahātmanā || 7 || 	Lomaśa said: 7. When Devas beginning with Hari and Brahmā, stationed in the middle of the Cosmic Egg, as well as the guardians of the worlds including Indra were enveloped by the fire of poison, Śaṃbhu was informed by the noble-souled Heraṃba (Gaṇeśa): Heraṃba said: 
heraṃba uvāca | he rudra he mahādeva he sthāṇo ha jagatpate | mayā vighnaṃ vinodena kṛtaṃ teṣāṃ sudurjayam || 8 || bhayena mati mohāttvāṃ nārccayaṃti ca māmapi | udyogaṃ ye prakurvanti teṣāṃ kleśo'dhiko bhavet || 9 || evamabhyarthitastena pinākī vṛṣabhadhvajaḥ | vighnāṃdhakārasūryeṇa gaṇādhipatinā tadā || 10 || 	8-9. O Rudra, O Mahādeva, O Sthāṇu, the lord of the universe, an obstacle very difficult to be surmounted has been created for them by me by way of amusement.[1] There are persons who start an enterprise, but either because of their fear or through the delusion of their minds, they do not worship you or me. The distress unto them will be very great. 
liṃgarūpo'bravīcchaṃbhurnirākāro nirāmayaḥ | niraṃjano vyomakeśaḥ kaparddī nīlalohitaḥ || 11 || 	10-11. On being requested thus by the over-lord of Gaṇas, who dispels obstacles like the sun dispelling darkness, the Pināka-bearing Lord with a bull for his emblem, the Lord Nīlalohita with matted hair, the lord devoid of ailments, the lord in the form of Liṅga, the unsullied lord without form or features, the sky-haired lord Śiva, Śaṃbhu spoke thus: Maheśvara said[3]: 
maheśvara uvāca | heraṃba śrṛṇu me vākyaṃ śraddhayā parayā yutaḥ | ahaṃkārātmakaṃ caiva jagadetaccarācaram || 12 || sthitiṃ karotyahaṃkāraḥ pralayotpattimeva ca | jagadādaugaṇapate tadā vijñaptimātrataḥ || 13 || māyāvirahitaṃ śāṃtaṃ dvaitādvaitaparaṃ sadā | jñaptimātrasvarūpaṃ tatsadānaṃdaikalakṣaṇam || 14 || 	12-14. O Heraṃba, listen to my words with great faith and attention. This universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings is of the form of Ahaṃkāra (Cosmic Ego). This Ahaṃkāra creates, sustains and destroys. At the beginning of the universe, O Gaṇapati, Vijñapti (Intelligence, Consciousness) alone (remained). It was devoid of Māyā. īt was quiescent and of the form of Dvaita and Advaita (duality and non-duality). It was in the form of intelligence alone characterized by existence and eternal bliss. 
gaṇapatiruvāca | yadi tvaṃ kevalo hyātmā paramānandalakṣaṇaḥ | tasmāttvadaparaṃ kiṃcinnānyadasti paraṃtapa || 15 || 	Gaṇapati said: 15. If you are the sole Ātman, characterized by supreme bliss, O Scorcher of foes, then there is nothing other than you. 
nānārūpaṃ kathaṃ jātaṃ surāsuravilakṣaṇam | vicitraṃ mohajananaṃ tribhirddevaiśca lakṣitam || 16 || 	16. Then how did the different forms originate, differentiated as Suras and Asuras? It is of variegated form observed by the three Devas. It is the cause of delusion. 
bhūtagrāmaiścaturbhiśca nānābhedaiḥ samanvitaiḥ | jātaṃ saṃsāracakraṃ ca nityānityavilakṣaṇam || 17 || 	17. The cycle of worldly existence originated as different from Nitya (eternal) and Anitya (transient). It consists of four types or species of living beings endowed with many distinctive features etc. 
parasparavirodhena jñānavādena mohitāḥ | karmavādaratāḥ kecitkecitsvaguṇamāśritāḥ || 18 || 	18. People are deluded by various doctrines and tenets of knowledge antagonistic to one another. Some are devoted to the doctrine of Karman. Some resort to their (intrinsic) qualities. 
jñānaniṣṭhāśca ye kecitparasparavirodhinaḥ | evaṃ saṃśayamāpannaṃ trāhi māṃ vṛṣabhadhvaja || 19 || 	19. A few are adherents of the path of knowledge but they are opposed to one another. O Bull-bānnered Lord, thus I have been overwhelmed by doubts. Save me (by dispelling the doubt). 
ahaṃ gaṇaśca kutratyāḥ kva cāyaṃ vṛṣabhaḥ prabho | ete cānye ca bahavaḥ kuto jātāśca kutra vai || 20 || 	20. Where do I and the Gaṇas belong to? Whence is this bull, O'Lord? From where are these and many others born? Where (do they go)? 
kṛtāḥ sarve mahābhāgāḥ sāttvikā rājasāśca vai | prahasya bhagavāñchaṃbhurgaṇeśaṃ vaktumudyataḥ || 21 || 	21. Whence are all these exceedingly fortunate ones made into Sāttvikas, Rājasas etc.? Lord Śaṃbhu laughed and began to speak to Gaṇeśa: 
maheśvara uvāca | kālaśaktyā ca jātāni rajaḥsattvatamāṃsi ca | tairāvṛtaṃ jagatsarvaṃ sadevāsumānuṣam || 22 || 	Maheśvara said: 22. Rajas, Sattva and Tamas are produced by Kālaśakti (Power of Time). The entire universe including Devas, Asuras and human beings is enveloped by them. 
paridṛśyamānametaccānaśvaraṃ paramārthataḥ | viddhyetatsarvasiddhyaiva kṛtakatvācca naśvaram || 23 || 	23. This (world) that is being seen is imperishable ultimately, but, understand that as an evolved effect it is perishable. It is evolved by means of all Siddhis. 
lomaśa uvāca | yāvadgaṇeśasaṃyukto bhāṣamāṇaḥ sadāśivaḥ | liṃgarūpī viśvarūpaḥ prādurbhūtā sadāśivāt || 24 || śivarūpā jagadyoniḥ kāryakāraṇarūpiṇī | liṃgarūpī sa bhagavānnimagnastatkṣaṇādabhūt || 25 || 	24-25. While Sadāśiva of Cosmic Form and in the form of the Liṅga was conversing with Gaṇeśa, His Power (Śakti called Śiva), the source of the universe of the nature of cause and effect was born of Sadāśiva. At the same instant, the Lord in the form of the Liṅga became submerged. 
ekā sthitā parā śaktirbrahmavidyātmalakṣaṇā | gaṇeśo vismayāviṣṭo hyavalokanatatparaḥ || 26 || 	26. The single supreme Śakti, characterized as the Ātman of Brahmavidyā abided (there). Overwhelmed by wonder, Gaṇeśa became engrossed in looking (at that form). 
ṛṣaya ūcuḥ | prakṛtyantargataṃ sarvaṃ jagadetaccarācaram | gaṇeśasya pṛthaktvaṃ ca kathaṃ jātaṃ taducyatām || 27 || 	The sages asked: 27. If this entire universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings is included within Prakṛti, how is it then that Gaṇeśa was able to preserve his separate entity? Let this be explained. 
lomaśa uvāca | sākṣātprakṛtyāḥ saṃbhūto gaṇeśo bhagavānabhūt | yathārūpaḥ śivaḥ sākṣāttadrūpo hi gaṇeśvaraḥ || 28 || 	Lomaśa replied: 28. Lord Gaṇeśa was directly born of Prakṛti herself.[4] Gaṇeśvara has the same form as that of Śiva himself. 
śivena saha saṃgrāmo hyabhūttasya mahātmanaḥ | ajñānātprakṛto bhūtvā bahukālaṃ nirantaram || 29 || 	29-30. A battle ensued between Śiva and that noble-souled one who had been Prākṛta (born of Prakṛti) due to ignorance. That battle continued without a break for a long time. 
tasya dṛṣṭvā hyajeyatvaṃ gajārūḍhasya tattadā | triśūlenāhanacchaṃbhuḥ sagajaṃ tamapātayat || 30 || 	On observing that he was invincible as long as he was riding an elephant, Śaṃbhu hit him with his trident and toppled him down along with the elephant. 
tadā stuto mahādevaḥ paraśaktyā paraṃtapaḥ | paraśaktimuvācedaṃ varaṃ varaya śobhane || 31 || 	31. Then Mahādeva the scorcher of enemies, was eulogized by the Supreme Power (Prakṛti). The lord then said to the great Śakti, “O splendid lady, choose your boon.” 
tadā vṛto mahādevo vareṇa parameṇa hi | yo'yaṃ tvayā hato deva mama putro na saṃśayaḥ || 32 || tvāṃ na jānātyayaṃ mūḍhaḥ prakṛtyaṃśasamudbhavaḥ | tasmātputraṃ jīvayemaṃ mama tṛṣṭyarthameva ca || 33 || 	32-33. Then an excellent boon was chosen from Mahādeva: “O lord, he who was killed by you was undoubtedly my son. Being born of a part of Prakṛti, he is deluded. Hence he does not know you. In order to gratify me, resuscitate this son of mine.” 
prahasya bhagavānrudro māyāputramajīvayat | siṃdhuravadanenaiva mukhe sa samayojayat || 34 || 	34. Lord Rudra laughed loudly and revived the son of Māyā. He fixed the head of an elephant to his body. 
tadā gajānano jātaḥ prasādācchaṃkarasya ca | māyāputropi nirmāyo jñānavānsaṃbabhūva ha || 35 || 	35. Thus the elephant-faced lord was born by the grace of Śaṅkara. Although he was the son of Māyā, he was free from the clutches of Māyā and became endowed with (spiritual) knowledge. 
ātmajñānāmṛtenaiva nityatṛpto nirāmayaḥ | samādhisaṃsthito raudraḥ kālakālāṃtako'bhavat || 36 || 	36. He was perpetually contented with the nectar of the knowledge of Ātman. He was free from ailments. Sitting in deep meditation, he became very fierce and then destroyed Kāla (god of death) of black complexion. 
yogadaṃḍārthamutpāṭya svakīyaṃ daśanaṃ mahat | kare gṛhya gaṇādhyakṣaḥ śabdhabrahmātivarttate | ṛddhisiddhidvayenaiva ekatvena virājitaḥ || 37 || 	37. He pulled out his own huge tooth for the sake of Yogadaṇḍa[5] (the mystic wand of Yogic practice) and held it in his hand. He was the presiding deity of the Gaṇas. He surpasses the Śabdabrahman (the Vedas or the supreme spiritual knowledge expressed in words). Though accompanied by both Ṛddhi and Siddhi, he shines in his aloneness. 
ye te gaṇāśca vighnāśca ye cānye'bhyadhikā bhuvi | teṣāmapi patirjātaḥ kṛto'sau śaṃbhunā tadā || 38 || 	38. The groups of Gaṇas and Vighnas (obstacles) and many others superior to these—whatever there was on the earth, he became the lord thereof. He was made so by Śaṃbhu then. 
tasmādvi lokayāmāsa prakṛtiṃ viśvarūpiṇīm | pṛthaksthitvāgrato jānālliṃgaṃ prakṛtimeva ca | dadarśa vimalaṃ liṃgaṃ prakṛtisthaṃ svabhāvataḥ || 39 || ātmānaṃ ca gaṇaiḥ sāddhaṃ tathaiva ca jagattrayam | līnaṃ liṃge samastaṃ taddherambo jñānavānapi || 40 || 	39. Hence he was able to see Prakṛti which has the Cosmic form. He remained separate and was able to realize the Liṅga as well as the Prakṛti. He saw the pure Liṅga naturally abiding in the Prakṛti. 40. Heraṃba who was equipped with perfect knowledge saw himself along with the Gaṇas as well as the three worlds entirely merged in the Liṅga. 
mumoha ca punaḥ saṃjñāṃ pratilabhya prayatnataḥ | nanāma śirasā tābhyāmīśābhyāṃ sa gaṇeśvaraḥ || 41 || 	41. Though he was endowed with perfect knowledge, he lost his consciousness. He regained it with very great effort. The lord of the Gaṇas bowed down his head to those two supreme powers. 
tadā dadarśa tatraiva lokasaṃhārakārakam | brahmāṇaṃ caiva rudraṃ ca viṣṇuṃ caiva sadāśivam || 42 || 	42. Then he saw there itself Brahmā, Rudra, Viṣṇu and Sadāśiva in the form of the annihilator of the worlds. 
dadarśa pretatulyāni liṃgaśaktyātmakāni ca | brahmāṇḍagolakānyeva koṭiśaḥ paramāṇuvat || 43 || līyaṃte ca vilīyaṃte maheśe liṃgarūpiṇi | prakṛtyaṃtargataṃ liṃgaṃ liṃgasyāṃtargatā ca sā || 44 || 	43-45. He saw some beings resembling ghosts. They were the Liṅgaśaktis. He saw crores of spherical Cosmic Eggs like so many atoms. They were getting merged and dissolved in Maheśa who was in the form of a Liṅga. 
śaktyā liṃgaṃ ca saṃchannaṃ tadā sarvamadṛśyata | liṃgena śaktiḥ saṃchannā parasparamavartata || 45 || 	The Liṅga was inside the Prakṛti and the Prakṛti was within the Liṅga. The whole of the Liṅga was seen covered by Śakti. The Śakti was covered by the Liṅga. Thus the two encompassed each other.{GL_NOTE::} 
śivābhyāṃ saṃśritaṃ lokaṃ jagadetaccarācaram | gaṇeśo vāpi tajjñānaṃ na pare'pi tathāvidan || 46 || 	46. The whole world consisting of the mobile and immobile beings stayed supported by both Śivas (i.e. Śiva ānd Śakti). Only Gaṇeśa and none else, though great, had that knowledge. 
tadovāca mahātejā gaṇādhyakṣo gaṇaiḥ saha | saśaktikaṃ stūyamānaḥ śaktyā ca parayā tadā || 47 || 	47. The presiding deity of the Gaṇas (Lord Gaṇeśa), of great splendour, accompanied by the Gaṇas eulogized with great strength, the lord accompanied by Śakti. 
gaṇeśa uvāca | namāmi devaṃ śaktyānvitaṃ jñānarūpaṃ prasannaṃ jñānātparaṃ paramaṃjyotirūpam | rūpātparaṃ paramaṃ tattvarūpaṃ tattvātparaṃ paramaṃ maṃgalaṃ ca ānaṃdākhyaṃ niṣkalaṃ nirviṣādam || 48 || 	Gaṇeśa prayed: 48. I bow down to the god accompanied by His Śakti (Power)—the Lord who is the embodiment of knowledge, who is kindly disposed (but) beyond the ken of knowledge and of the form of supreme Light, who transcends forms, is the Supreme Reality incarnate, who is beyond the principles (categories of Sāṅkhyas), supremely auspicious, who is called Bliss undivided and uncontaminated by sorrow. 
dhūmātparamayovahnirdhūmavatpratibhāsate | prakṛtyaṃtargastvaṃ hi lakṣyase jñānisaṃbhavaḥ | prakṛtyaṃtargatastvaṃ hi māyāvyaktiritīyase || 49 || 	49-50. The fire in (a ball of) iron is beyond smoke (smokeless), but it appears as though filled with smoke. You who are the source of knowledge, appear to be within Prakṛti. You who are present within the Prakṛti by Māyā, are spoken of as manifested. 
evaṃvidhastvaṃ bhagavansvamāyayā sṛjasyatholuṃpasi pāsi viśvam | asmādgarātsarvamidaṃ pranaṣṭaṃ sabrahmavipreṃdrayutaṃ carācaram || 50 || 	You whose nature is such, O lord, create, annihilate and protect the universe by your Māyā. On account of this poison, the entire universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings and accompanied by Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Indra, has been destroyed. 
yathā purāsīrbhagavānmaheśastrailokyanātho'si carācarātmā | kuruṣya śīghraṃ sahajīvakośaṃ carācaraṃ tatsakalaṃ pradagdham || 51 || 	51. You are lord Maheśa. You are the lord of the three worlds. You are the immanent soul of the mobile and immobile beings. The mobile and immobile beings along with the vestures of individual souls, have been completely burnt down. Please revive them quickly and make it (the world) as it was before. 
lomaśa uvāca | evaṃ stuto gaṇeśena bhagavānbhūtabhāvanaḥ | yadutthitaṃ kālakūṭaṃ lokasaṃhārakārakam || 52 || liṃgarūpeṇa tadgrastaṃ vimalaṃ cākarottadā | sadevāsuramartyāśca sarvāṇi trijaganti ca | tatkṣaṇādrakṣitānyeva kṛpayā parayā yutaḥ || 53 || 	52-54. On being eulogized thus by Gaṇeśa, the Lord (Siva), the sanctifier of all living beings, assumed the form of a Liṅga and consumed the Kālakūṭa that arose there and caused the destruction of all the worlds. He made everything free from impurities. Since the lord was endowed with great compassion and considerateness, all Devas, Asuras and human beings and all the three worlds were instantaneously saved. 
brahmā viṣṇuḥ sureṃdraśca lokapālāḥ saharṣayaḥ | yakṣā vidyādharāḥ siddhā gaṃdharvāpsarasāṃ gaṇāḥ | utthitāścaiva te sarve nidrāparigatā iva || 54 || 	Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Surendra, the Guardians of the Quarters along with the sages, Yakṣas, Vidyādharas, Siddhas, Gandharvas and groups of celestial damsels—all of them got up as though from sleep. 
vismayena samāviṣṭā babhūvurjātasādhvasāḥ | sarve devāsurāścaiva ūcurāścaryavattataḥ || 55 || 	55. They were struck with wonder. They were agitated and frightened. All Devas and Asuras said in dismay: 
kva kālakūṭaṃ sumahadyena vidrāvitā vayam | mṛtaprāyāḥ kṛtāḥ sadyaḥ salokapālakā hyamī || 56 || ityabruvaṃstadā daityāstūṣṇīṃbhūtāstadā sthitāḥ | śakrādayo lokapālā viṣṇuṃ sarveśvareśvaram | brahmāṇaṃ ca puraskṛtya idamūcuḥ samedhitā || 57 || 	56-62. “Where is that immense Kālakūṭa by which we had been compelled to flee and made almost dead along with the Guardians of the Quarters?” So said they, but Daityas remained silent. The Guardians of the Quarters beginning with Śakra, who were able to regain strength and happiness with god Brahmā as their leader, said this after honouring Viṣṇu, the lord of all lords: 
kenedaṃ kāritaṃ viṣṇo na vidāmo'lpamedhasaḥ | tadā prahasya bhagavānbrahmaṇā saha taiḥ suraiḥ || 58 || samādhimagamansarve'pyekāgramanasastadā | tattvajñānena nirhṛtya kāmakrodādikāndvijāḥ || 59 || tadātmani sthitaṃ liṃgamapaśyanvi budhādayaḥ | viṣṇuṃ puraskṛtya tadā tuṣṭuvuḥ paramārthataḥ || 60 || 	“By whom has this been caused? We do not know as we are deficient in intelligence.” Then Viṣṇu laughed at Brahmā and all those (Suras). All of them then began to meditate with great concentration of their minds. O Brāhmaṇas, that dispelled base emotions such as lust and anger as well as other feelings by means of the knowledge of Reality. Then Devas and others saw the Liṅga present in their own Ātman (Soul). Keeping Viṣṇu at their head, they eulogized the Lord for the attainment of the ultimate truth: 
ātmanā paramātmānaṃ yoginaḥ paryupāsate || 61 || liṃgameva paraṃ jñānaṃ liṃgameva paraṃ tapaḥ | liṃgameva paro dharmo liṃgameva parā gatiḥ | tasmālliṃgātparataraṃ yacca kiṃcinna vidyate || 62 || 	“Yogins worship the Supreme Soul through their own souls. The Liṅga alone is the greatest knowledge. The Liṅga alone is the greatest penance. The Liṅga alone is the greatest Dharma. The Liṅga alone is the greatest goal. Hence, there is nothing at all which (can be called) greater than the Liṅga.” 
evaṃ bruvaṃto hi tadā surāsurāḥ salokapālā ṛṣibhiśca sākam | viṣṇuṃ puraskṛtya tamālavarṇaṃ śaṃbhuṃ śaraṇyaṃ śaraṇaṃ prapannāḥ || 63 || 	63. After saying thus, Suras and Asuras along with the Guardians of the Quarters and sages kept Viṣṇu whose complexion is dark like the Indian cinnamon, at their head. They then sought refuge in Śaṃbhu who is worthy of being resorted to: 
trāhitrāhi mahādeva kṛpālo parameśvara | purā trātā yathā sarve tathātvaṃ trātumarhasi || 64 || 	64. “Save us, save us, O Mahādeva, O merciful lord, O Supreme God. It behoves you to save us as we had been saved before (by you). 
taddevadeva bhavataścaraṇāraviṃdaṃ sevānubaṃdhamahimānamanaṃtarūpam | tvadāśritaṃ yatparamānukaṃpayā namo'stu te devavara prasīda || 65 || 	65. O Lord of Devas, your lotus-like feet possess greatness befitting our repeated service. They have infinite forms. We have resorted to them. (Save us) with the greatest mercy. Obeisance to you, O excellent one among Devas. Be pleased.” 
liṃgasvarūpamadhyastho bhagavānbhūtabhāvanaḥ | sarvaiḥ suragaṇaiḥ sākaṃ babhāṣedaṃ ramāpatiḥ || 66 || 	66. Lord Ramāpati (Viṣṇu), the sanctifier of the living beings, stood in the middle of the form of Liṅga along with ail the groups of Suras and spoke thus: 
tvaṃ liṃgarūpī bhagavāñjagatāmabhayapradaḥ | viṣṇunā saṃstuto devo liṃgarūpī maheśvaraḥ || 67 || mṛtāstrātā garātsarve tasmānmṛtyuṃjaya prabho | rakṣarakṣa mahākāla tripurāṃta namostu te || 68 || 	67-69. “You are the Lord in the form of the Liṅga. You bestow protection from fear on all the worlds. All those who died on account of the poison, have been saved. Hence, O Lord, the conqueror of Mṛtyu (Death), save us, save us. O Mahākāla, the destroyer of Tripura, obeisance to you.” 
viṣṇunā saṃstuto devo liṃgarūpī maheśvaraḥ | prādurbabhūva sāṃbo'tha bodhayanniva tānsurān || 69 || 	On being eulogized by Viṣṇu, Lord Maheśvara in the form of the Liṅga appeared before them along with Aṃbā (goddess Pārvatī). He appeared to awaken (i.e. enlighten) those Suras: 
he viṣṇo he surāḥ sarva ṛṣayaḥ śrūyatāmidam | manyate'pi hi saṃsāre anitye nityatākulam || 70 || avilokayatā'tmātmanā vibudhādayaḥ | kiṃ yajñaiḥ kiṃ tapobhiśca kimudyogena karmaṇām || 71 || ekatvena pṛthaktvena kiṃcinnaiva prayojanam | yasmādbhavadbhirmilitaiḥ kṛtaṃ yatkarma duṣkaram || 72 || 	70-74. “O Viṣṇu, ye all Suras and Sages, let this be heard. Ordinary people think that the worldly existence is eternal, while it is only transitory. Thereby, they are agitated. O Devas and others, of what avail are the Yajñas, austerities and activities connected with holy rites, if one does not perceive the (Supreme) Ātman by means of (his individual Ātman)? There is no benefit therefrom, whether they are performed collectively or separately. All of you joined together and carried out a very difficult task, namely the churning of the ocean. T??? you did for the sake of getting nectar. But why was it performed after rejecting Mṛtyuñjaya and always disrespecting me? Hence all of you undoubtedly fell into the mouth of Death. 
tasmātsarve mṛtyumukhaṃ patitā vai na saṃśayaḥ | asmābhirnirmito devo gaṇeśaḥ kāryasiddhaye || 74 || 	Lord Gaṇeśa has been created by us for the purpose of achieving success in an undertaking. 
na namaṃti gaṇeśaṃ ca durgāṃ caiva tathāvidhām | kleśabhājo bhaviṣyati nātra kāryā vicāraṇā || 75 || 	75. Those who do not bow down to Gaṇeśa as well as Durgā of similar nature will be victims of distress. There is no doubt about this. 
yūyaṃ sarve tvadharmiṣṭhāḥ stabdhāḥ paṃḍitamāninaḥ | kāryākāryamavijñāya kevalaṃ mānamohitāḥ || 76 || 	76. All of you are sinful and stubborn. You profess to be learned without knowing what is right and what is wrong. You are deluded by mere false prestige. 
prarocanaparāḥ sarve kṣudrāśceṃdrādayo vṛthā | nātmānaṃ ca prapaṃcena vetsi tvaṃ hi śacīpate || 78 || 	77-78. All of you, groups of Devas beginning with Indra, are devoted to the Vedas. All those beginning with Indra are mediocres, pleasure-seekers, praise-mongers and useless ones. O consort of Śacī (i.e. Indra), you do not understand yourself on account of delusion. 
kṛtaḥ prayatno hi mahānamṛtārthaṃ tvayā śaṭha | aśvamedhaśatenaiva yadrājyaṃ prāptavānasi | api tacca parādhīna tanna jānāsi durmate || 79 || 	79. A great effort has been made by you for getting nectar, O rogue. You attained a kingdom by performing a hundred horse-sacrifices. Even that is under the control of your enemies now. O vicious one, you do not know that. 
yairvadavākyaistvaṃ mūḍha saṃstuto'si tapasvibhiḥ | te mūḍhāsto ṣayaṃti tvāṃ tattadrāgaparāyaṇāḥ || 80 || 	80. O deluded one, you have been eulogized by ascetics through the Vedic statements (hymns). Those ascetics are fools. They propitiate you, because they are prompted by different passions. 
viṣṇo tvaṃ ca pakṣapātānna jānāsi hitāhitam | kecidadhatāstvayā viṣṇo rakṣitāścaiva kecana || 81 || 	81. O Viṣṇu, on account of your partiality you do not know what is good and what is otherwise. Some persons are killed by you, O Viṣṇu, and some have been protected. 
icchāyuktastvamatraiva sadā bālakaceṣṭitaḥ | ye'nye ca lokapāḥ sarve teṣāṃ vārtā kutastviha || 82 || 	82. You are desirous of certain things in this matter. You are always childish in your activities. Why talk of all the other Guardians of the Quarters? 
anyathā hi kṛte hyarthe anyathātvaṃ bhaviṣyati | kāryasiddhirbhavedyena bhavadbhirvismṛtaṃ ca tat || 83 || 	83. If a matter is pursued in a way other than what is proper, the result is bound to be in a way other than (what is expected). You all forgot that thing whereby your efforts are crowned with success. 
yenādya rakṣitāḥ sarve kālakūṭamahābhayāt | yena nīlīkṛto viṣṇuryena sarve parājitāḥ || 84 || lokā bhasmīkṛtā yena tasmādyenāpi rakṣitāḥ | tasyārccanāvidhiḥ kāryo gaṇeśasya mahātmanaḥ || 85 || 	84-85. It is he by whom all (of you) have been saved from the great fear of Kālakūṭa today. It is he by whom you have been saved from a poison by which Viṣṇu is turned blue (dark-complexioned), by which all of you were defeated and by which all the worlds have been reduced to ash. Hence, the worship of that noble-souled Gaṇeśa should be performed by you. 
karmāraṃbhe tu vighneśaṃ ye nārcaṃti gaṇādhipam | kāryasiddhirna teṣāṃ vai bhavettu bhavatāṃ yathā || 86 || 	86. If at the beginning of any holy rite, people do not worship Gaṇādhipa (Gaṇeśa), they will never realize their objectives as in your own case.” 
etanmaheśasya vaco niśamya surāsurāḥ kiṃnaracāraṇāśca | pūjāvidhānaṃ paramārthato'pi papracchurenaṃ ca tadā girīśam || 87 || 	87. On hearing these words of Maheśa, Suras, Asuras, Kinnaras and Cāraṇas asked Girīśa about the method of worship in the proper manner. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES:

dhyānamādau prakartavyaṃ gaṇeśasya yathāvidhi | āgamā bahavo jātā gaṇeśasya yathā mama || 3 || 	3. At the outset, meditation on Gaṇeśa should be performed in. accordance with scriptural injunctions. 
bahudhopāsakā yasmāttamaḥ sattvarajonvitāḥ | gaṇabhedena tānyeva nāmāni bahudhā'bhavat || 4 || 	4. As the worshippers are of various types having Tāmasa, Sāttvika and Rājasa traits, the names also (of Gaṇeśa) became many in number according to their class (characterized by a particular Guṇa). 
paṃcavaktro gaṇādhyakṣo daśabāhustrilocanaḥ | kāṃtasphaṭikasaṃkāśo nīlakaṃṭho gajānanaḥ || 5 || 	5. They are as follows: Pañcavaktra (Five-faced), Gaṇādhyakṣa (Chief of the Gaṇas—Śiva’s attendants), Daśabāhu (Ten-armed), Trilocana (Three-eyed), Kāntasphaṭika-saṅkāśa (Resembling a shining crystal), Nīlakaṇṭha (Blue-throated), Gajānana (Elephant-faced). 
mukhāni tasya paṃcaiva kathayāmi yatātatham || 6 || 	6. I shall describe his five faces correctly. 
madhyamaṃ tu mukhaṃ gauraṃ caturdantaṃ trilocanam | śuṃḍādaṃḍamanojñaṃ ca puṣkare modakānvitam || 7 || 	7. The middle face is fair in colour with four teeth and three eyes. It is beautiful with a long trunk. In the trunk he keeps a modaka (a round piece of sweetmeat). 
tathānyatpītavarṇaṃ ca nīlaṃ ca śubhalakṣaṇam | piṃgalaṃ ca tathā śubhraṃ gaṇeśasya śubhānanam || 8 || 	8. The other faces of Gaṇeśa are yellow, auspicious blue, tawny and grey. The faces are splendid and characterized by good features. 
tathā daśabhujeṣveva hyāyudhāni bravīmi vaḥ | pāśaṃ pasśupadme ca aṃkuśaṃ daṃtameva ca || 9 || 	9-10. I shall tell you the weapons in the ten hands (of Gaṇeśa). They are: noose, axe, lotus, goad, tusk, rosary, ploughshare, pestle, varada (mudrā—gesture) (the hand indicating bestowal of boons) and a vessel containing modakas. One should meditate that he is holding the vessel in his hand. 
laṃbodara virūpākṣaṃ nivītaṃ mekhalānvitam | yogāsane copaviṣṭaṃ caṃdralekhāṃ kaśekharam || 11 || 	11-14. The meditation is of three types. In Sāttvika meditation contemplate thus: (He is) Laṃbodara (Pot-bellied). Virūpākṣa (of uneven eyes = three-eyed), Nivīta (sacred thread worn like a garland). He is having a girdle. He is seated in the Yogic posture; the crescent-moon adorns his head. 
caturbhujaṃ trinayanamekadaṃtaṃ mahodaram | pāśāṃkuśadharaṃ devaṃ daṃtamodakapātrakam || 13 || 	Rājasa meditation is as in the case of men. The deity has pure golden complexion. (He is) elephant-faced and super-natural. He has four hands, three eyes, one tusk and huge belly. 
nīlaṃ ca tāmasaṃ dhyānamevaṃ trividhamucyate | tataḥ pūjā prakartavyā bhavadbhiḥ śīghrameva ca || 14 || 	Thus there are three types of Dhyāna. Thereafter, the worship should be begun quickly by you all. 
ekaviṃśatidūrvābhirdvābhyāṃ nāmnā pṛthakpṛthak | sarvanāmabhirekaiva dīyate gaṇanāyake || 15 || 	15. Twenty-one Dūrvā grass-blades are (to be) taken. Two blades of grass are offered after uttering one name. (Thus ten names are uttered and twenty blades of grass are offered.) In the end, all the names are uttered and one blade of grass is offered to the lord of Gaṇas. 
tathaiva nāmabhirdeyā ekaviṃśatimodakāḥ | daśanāmānyahaṃ vakṣye pūjanārthaṃ pṛthakpṛthak || 16 || 	16. Similarly twenty-one modakas should be offered. I shall mention the ten names intended for worshipping separately. 
gaṇādhipa namastestu umāputrāghanāśana | vināyakeśaputroti sarvasiddhipradāyaka || 17 || ekadaṃtebhavaktreti tathā mūṣakavāhana | kumāragurave tubhyaṃ pūjanīyaḥ prayatnataḥ || 18 || 	17-18. The names are: 1. Gaṇādhipa (Lord of Gaṇas), 2. Umāputra (Son of Umā), 3. Aghanāśana (Destroyer of sins), 4. Vināyāka, 5. Īśaputra (Son of Lord Śiva), 6. Sarvasiddhipratdāyaka (Bestower of all Siddhis), 7. Ekadanta (One-tusked), 8. Ibhavaktra (Elephant-faced), 9. Mūṣakavāhana (Mouse-vehicled) and 10. Kumāraguru (The elder brother of Kumāra). At the end of every word namaste'stu (Obeisance to you) should be added. In the case of the last, the words Kumāragurave tubhyaṃ namo’stu, ‘Obeisance to you, O Kumāraguru’ should be uttered. Thus Gaṇeśa should be worshipped with care. 
evamuktvā surānsadyaḥ pariṣvajya ca sādaram | viṣṇuṃ guhāśayaṃ sadyo brahmāṇaṃ ca sadāśivaḥ || 19 || tirodhāna gataḥ sadyaḥ śaṃbhuḥ paramaśobhanaḥ | praṇamya śaṃbhuṃ te sarve gaṇādhyakṣārccane ratāḥ || 20 || 	19-20. After speaking thus to Suras, Sadāśiva, Śaṃbhu, the highly splendid lord, eagerly embraced Viṣṇu who abides in the cavity of heart, as well as Brahmā, and (he) immediately vanished. All of them bowed down to Śaṃbhu and then became engaged in worshipping Gaṇādhyakṣa (Gaṇeśa). 
tataḥ saṃpūjya vidhivadgaṇādhyakṣārccane ratāḥ | upacārairanekaiśca dūrvābhiśca pṛthakpṛthak || 21 || 	21. After worshipping him in accordance with the injunctions, they became engaged in honouring him with various Upacāras (ways of service) and the Dūrvā grass blades separately. 
saṃtuṣṭo hi gaṇādhyakṣo devānāṃ varado'bhavat | pradakṣiṇaṃ namaskṛtya taiḥ sarvairabhitoṣitaḥ || 22 || 	22. Gaṇeśa who was contented and delighted (by their worship) bestowed boons on Devas. They circumambulated him, bowed down to him and propitiated him. 
tamoguṇānvitāḥ sarve hyasurā nābhyapūjayan | upahāsaparāste vai devānpratyasurottamāḥ || 23 || 	23. Asuras who possessed only Tamas Guṇa did not worship Gaṇeśa.[2] The excellent Asuras were engaged in ridiculing Devas. 
pūjayitvā śāṃkariṃ te punaḥ kṣīrārṇavaṃ yayuḥ | brahmā viṣṇuśca ṛṣayo devadaityāḥ surottamāḥ || 24 || maṃthānaṃ maṃdaraṃ kṛtvā rajjuṃ kṛtvātha vāsukim | mamaṃthuśca tadā devā viṣṇuṃ kṛtvātha sannidhau || 25 || 	24-25. Devas finished worshipping the son of Śaṅkara and went to the Milk Ocean once again. Brahmā, Viṣṇu, the excellent Suras, Devas, Daityas and sages made Mandara the churning rod and Vāsuki the churning rope. Keeping Viṣṇu near them, Devas began the churning. 
mathyamāne tadābdhau ca nirgataścaṃdra agrataḥ | pīyūṣapūrṇaḥ sarveṣāṃ devānāṃ kāryasiddhaye || 26 || 	26. When the ocean was being churned, it was the Moon that came out at the outset,[3] for the purpose of realizing the objectives of all Devas. He was full of nectar. 
śaunaka uvāca | arṇave kiṃ purā caṃdro nikṣiptaḥ kena suvrata | gajādikāni ratnāni kathitāni tvayā purā || 27 || etatsarvaṃ samāsena ādau kathaya me prabho | jñātvā sarve vayaṃ sūta paścādāvarṇayāmahe || 28 || 	Śaunaka said: 27-29. O sage of holy rites, was the Moon formerly placed in the ocean? By whom was he placed? It was told by you formerly that the excellent gems like the elephant etc. (had been cast into the ocean). O lord, tell me all these things briefly in the beginning. After understanding these, all of us shall later describe them. 
teṣāṃ tadvacanaṃ śrutvā sūto vākyamupādade || 29 || 	On hearing their words, Sūta began his narrative: 
caṃdra āpomayo viprā atriputro guṇānvitaḥ | utpanno hyanasūyāyāṃ brahmaṇoṃ'śātsamudbhavaḥ | rudrasyāṃśāddhi durvāsā viṣṇoraṃśāttu dattakaḥ || 30 || 	30. Candra (the Moon) is watery by nature, O Brāhmaṇas. He was born as the son of Atri. He was endowed with all good qualities. He was born of Anasūya from a part of Brahmā. Durvāsas was born from a part of Rudra and Dattaka (i.e. Datta) was born from a part of Viṣṇu. 
kṣīrābdhiṃ mathyamānaṃ tu dṛṣṭvā caṃdro mudānvitaḥ | kṣīrābdhirapi caṃdraṃ ca dṛṣṭvā so'pyutsuko'bhavat || 31 || 	31. On seeing the Milk Ocean being churned, Candra became delighted. On seeing the Moon, the Milk Ocean too became extremely attached to him. 
praviṣṭaścobhayaprītyā śrṛṇvatāṃ bho dvijottamāḥ | caṃdro hyamṛta pūrṇobhūdagrato devasannidhau || 32 || 	32. Since both of them liked each other, Candra entered the Ocean. Let this be heard, O excellent Brāhmaṇas. In front of and in the presence of Devas, Candra became filled with nectar. 
dṛṣṭvā ca kāṃtiṃ tvarito'tha caṃdro nīrājito devagaṇaistadānīm | vāditragoṣaistumulairanekairmṛdaṃgaśaṃkhaiḥ paṭahairanekaiḥ || 33 || 	33. On seeing the splendour of Candra, the Nīrājana rite (waving light around the face) was immediately performed by the groups of Devas with respect to Candra, along with the loud and tumultuous sounds of musical instruments, drums of many types and conchs. 
namaścakruśca te sarve sasurāsuradānavāḥ | tadā gargaṃ pṛcchamānā balaṃ caṃdrasya tattvataḥ || 34 || 	34. They all then bowed down to him along with Suras, Asuras and Dānavas. Then they asked Garga about the genuine inherent power of Candra.[4] 
gargeṇoktāstadā sarveṣāṃ balamadya vai | keṃdrasthānagatāḥ sarve bhavatāmuttamā grahāḥ || 35 || caṃdraṃ muruḥ samāyāto budhaścaiva samāgataḥ | ādityaśca tathā śukraḥ śaniraṃgārako mahān || 36 || tasmāccaṃdrabalaṃ śreṣṭhaṃ bhavatāṃ kāryasiddhaye | gomaṃtasaṃjñakonāma muhūrto'yaṃ jayapradaḥ || 37 || 	35-37. Thereupon, Garga told them, “All the Planets are powerful today. All the excellent Planets are in their central positions. (Therefore they are beneficial) to you. Guru (Jupiter) has come in conjunction with Candra (the Moon). Budha (Mercury) has also come in his contact. So also the Sun, Śukra (Venus), Śani (Saturn) and the great Planet Aṅgāraka (Mars). Hence the power and influence of Candra is very excellent for the realization of your objectives. This Muhūrta (auspicious time) named Gomanta[5] is the bestower of victory.” 
evamāśvāsitā devā gargeṇaiva mahātmanā | mamaṃthurabdhiṃ tvaritā garjamānā mahābalāḥ || 38 || 	38. At this encouraging assurance of the noble-souled Garga, the mighty Devas began to churn the ocean vigorously and roared (lustily in their eagerness). 
dviguṇaṃ balamāpannā mahātmāno dṛḍhavratāḥ | maheśaṃ smaramāṇāste gaṇeśaṃ ca punaḥ punaḥ || 39 || 	39. Remembering Maheśa and Gaṇeśa again and again, those noble-souled (Devas) of firm holy rites attained double strength. 
nirmathyamānādudadhergarjamānācca sarvaśaḥ | nirgatā surabhiḥ sākṣāddevānāṃ kāryasiddhaye || 40 || 	40. During churning, Surabhi (divine cow) came out directly for the sake of the accomplishment of the tasks of Devas, from the ocean that was roaring with a rumbling sound on all sides. 
tuṣṭā kapilavarṇāṃ sā ūdhobhāreṇa bhūyasā | taraṃgopari gacchaṃtī śanakaiḥ śanakaistataḥ || 41 || 	41. Tawny in colour and with quite heavy udders, the cow, in a contented mood, came very slowly floating over the waves. 
kāmadhenuṃ samāyāṃtīṃ dṛṣṭvā sarve surāsurāḥ | puṣpavarṣeṇa mahatā vavarṣuramitaprabhām || 42 || 	42. On seeing Kāmadhenu (Wish-yielding Cow) coming up, all Suras and Asuras showered flowers on that (cow) of unmeasured splendour. 
tadā tūryāṇyanekāni nedurvādyānyanekaśaḥ | ānītā jalamadhyācca saṃvṛtā gośatairapi || 43 || 	43. Various kinds of trumpets and musical instruments were played and drums were beaten. She was brought from the middle of the. waters (though) surrounded by hundreds of cows. 
tāsu nīlāśca kṛṣṇaśca kapilāśca kapiṃjalāḥ | babhravaḥ śyāmakā raktā jaṃbūvarṇāśca piṃgalāḥ | ābhiryuktā tadā gobhiḥ surabhiḥ pratyadṛśyata || 44 || 	44. Among them there were cows of various colours such as blue, black, tawny, partridge-coloured, smoke-coloured, dark-coloured, red ones, wooḍ-apple-coloured and reddish-brown ones. Surabhi was seen accompanied by these cows. 
asurāsurasaṃvītāṃ kāmadhenuṃ yayācire | ṛṣayo harṣasaṃyuktā devāndaityāṃśca tatkṣaṇāt || 45 || 	45. Sages who were delighted instantly entreated Devas and Asuras (to give to them) Kāmadhenu which was closely surrounded by them (Devas and Asuras). 
sarvebhyaścaiva viprebhyo nānāgotrebhya eva ca | surabhīsahitā gāvo dātavyā nātra saṃśayaḥ || 46 || 	46. “These cows aloṇg with Surabhi should be given to all Brāhmaṇas belonging to various Gotras. There is no doubt about it.” 
tairyācitāste'tra surāsurāśca daduśca tā gāḥ śivatoṣaṇāya | taiḥ svīkṛtāstā ṛṣibhiḥ sumaṃgalairmahātmabhiḥ puṇyatamaiḥ surabhyaḥ || 47 || 	47. On being requested by them, Suras and Asuras gave those cows to them in order to gratify Śiva. Those Surabhis (cows) were accepted by the noble-minded sages of great auspiciousness and excessive merit. 
puṇyāhaṃ munibhiḥ sarvaiḥ kāritāste tadā surāḥ | devānāṃ kāryasiddhyarthamasurāṇāṃ kṣayāya ca || 48 || 	48. Then Puṇyāhavācana[6] (the formal religious declaration ‘This is an auspicious day’) was performed for Suras by all those sages in order to enable Devas to achieve their objects and to cause the destruction of Asuras. 
punaḥ sarve susaṃrabdhā mamaṃthuḥ kṣīrasāgaram | mathyamānāttadā tasmādudadheśca tathā'bhavat || 49 || kalpavṛkṣaḥ pārijātaścūtaḥ saṃtānakastathā | tāndrumānekataḥ kṛtvā gandharvanagaropamān | mamaṃthurugraṃ tvaritāḥ punaḥ kṣīrārṇavaṃ budhā || 50 || 	49-50. All of them once again exerted themselves very well and churned the Milk Ocean. From the ocean that was being churned rose up Kalpavṛkṣa, Pārijāta, Cūta and Santānaka. They set apart those trees on one side, like the city of Gandharvas. Immediately those wise (Suras and Asuras) resumed the churning of the Milk Ocean powerfully in all earnestness. 
nirmathyamānādudadherabhavatsūryavarcasam | ratnānāmuttamaṃ ratnaṃ kaustubhākhyaṃ mahāprabham || 51 || 	51. From the ocean that was being churned emerged a highly refulgent, extremely bright, most excellent gem having the brilliance of the Sun. It was called Kaustubha. 
svakīyena prakāśena bhāsayaṃtaṃ jagattrayam | ciṃtāmaṇiṃ puraskṛtya kaustubhaṃ dadṛśurhi te || 52 || sarve surā dadustaṃ vai kaustubhaṃ viṣṇave tadā | ciṃtāmaṇi tataḥ kṛtvā madhye caiva surāsurāḥ | mamaṃthuḥ punarevābdhiṃ garjaṃtaste balotkaṭāḥ || 53 || mathyamānāttatastasmāduccaiḥśravāḥ samadbhutam | babhūva aśvo ratnānāṃ punaścairāvato gajaḥ || 54 || 	52-53. With its brilliance, it illuminated the three worlds. Keeping the Cintāmaṇi (a miraculous stone) in front, they saw the Kaustubha brightening the worlds. All those Suras gave the Kaustubha to Viṣṇu. Suras and Asuras of enhanced strength lustily roared again and began to churn the ocean keeping Cintāmaṇi in the middle. 
tathaiva gajaratnaṃ ca catuḥṣaṣṭyā samanvitam | gajānāṃ pāṃḍurāṇāṃ ca caturddantaṃ madānvitam || 55 || tānsarvānmadhyataḥ kṛtvā punaścaiva mamaṃthire | nirmathyamānādudadhernirgatāni bahūnyatha || 56 || madirā vijayā bhṛṃgī tathā laśunagṛṃjanāḥ | atīva unmādakaro dhattūraḥ puṣkarastathā || 57 || 	54-58. From the ocean that was being churned rose up Uccaiḥśravas, the wonderful gem of a horse, and then Airāvata, the gem of an elephant, along with sixty-four other white elephants each with four tusks and in the rut. They set apart all these in the middle and churned once again. Many precious things then arose from the ocean that was being churned, viz. the wine Vijayā, Bhṛṅgī, garlic, turnip, the poisonous and highly intoxicating Dhattūra (Datura Alba) which causes too much of madness, and Puṣkara. All these were placed on the shore of the ocean without any hurry. Again those great Asuras churned the ocean along with the excellent Suras. 
vadaṃti sarve kenasiddhāṃtayuktāṃ yāṃ yogamāyāṃ jñānaśaktyānvitā ye || 61 || 	59-61. As the ocean was being churned once again, that divine Lakṣmī,[7] the sole protector of the worlds, rose up from it. Those who are the knowers of Brahman call her Ānvīkṣikī (Metaphysics). Others praise her as Mūlavidyā. Some competent persons call her Brahmavidyā. Some call her Siddhi (Success), Ṛddhi (Prosperity), Ājñā (Command) and Āśā (Hope). Some Yogins call her Vaiṣṇavī. Some exponents of Māyā always engaged in Yogic practice call her Māyā. All people call her Kenasiddhāntayuktā (the one associated with Brahman—the Principle spoken of in the Kenopaniṣad). Those who are equipped with the power of knowledge call her Yogamāyā. 
nānāratnapradīpaiśca nīrājitamukhāṃbujām | cāruprasannavadanāṃ hāranūpūraśobhitām || 65 || mūrddhani dhriyamāṇena cchatreṇāpi virājitām | cāmarairvījyamānāṃ tāṃ gaṃgākallolalohitaiḥ || 66 || pāṃḍuraṃ gajamārūḍhāṃ stūyamānāṃ maharṣibhiḥ | suradrumapuṣpamālāṃ bibhratīṃ mallikāyutām || 67 || 	62-69. They saw Mahālakṣmī coming slowly. She was very fair, youthful and tender with the filaments of the lotus for her ornaments. She was sweetly smiling with beautiful teeth. A lady of slender shade, she had the fresh youthfulness as an adornment. Her garments and ornaments were variegated with the refulgence of many gems. Her lips were red like the Biṃba (Momordica monadelpha) fruits; the nose was very beautiful and the neck and the eyes were very splendid. She was very slender with fine waistline and splendid buttocks. The hips were large. Her lotus-like face was brilliantly illuminated by means of a number of gems that served the purpose of the lights in a Nīrājana rite for her face. Her face was fascinating and delightful. She was remarkably splendid with her necklaces and anklets. An umbrella was gorgeously held above her head. She was being fanned with chowries gently shaken by the waves of Gaṅgā. She was riding a white elephant and was being eulogized by great sages. With the ends of her hands, she held a garland of the flowers of heavenly trees along with jasmine flowers. 
karāgre dhriyamāṇāṃ tāṃ dṛṣṭvā devāḥ samutsukāḥ | ālokanaparā yāvattāvattāndadṛśe hyasau || 68 || devāṃśca dānavāṃścaiva siddhacāraṇapannagān | yathā mātā svaputrāṃśca mahālakṣmīstathā satī || 69 || 	On seeing her Devas were eager to look at her at close quarters. But she, Mahālakṣmī, the chaste lady, looked at Devas, Dānavas, Siddhas, Cāraṇas and Serpents in the same manner as a mother looks (affectionately) at her children. 
ālokitāstathā devāstayā lakṣmyā śriyānvitāḥ | sañjātāstatkṣaṇādeva rājya lakṣaṇalakṣitāḥ | daityāste niḥśrikā jātā ye śriyā'navalokitāḥ || 70 || 	70. Devas were glanced at by that Lakṣmī. So they became prosperous instantaneously and were characterized by those indications of attainment of the kingdom. Daityas who were not glanced at by Lakṣmī became devoid of splendour (royal glory). 
nirīkṣyamāṇā ca tadā mukundaṃ tamālanīlaṃ sukapolanāsam | vibhrājamānaṃ vapuṣā pareṇa śrīvatsalakṣmaṃ sadayāvalokam || 71 || 	71-72. She glanced (lovingly) at Mukunda who was blue in complexion like Tamāla (Xanthochymus pictorius), whose cheeks and nose were very handsome, who shone brilliantly with his superior person and was characterized by Śrīvatsa and looked (at everyone mercifully). 
dṛṣṭvā tadaiva sahasā vanamālayānvitā lakṣmīrgajādavatatāra suvismayaṃtī | kaṃṭhe sasarja puruṣasya parasya viṣṇormālāṃ śriyā viracitāṃ bhramarairupetām || 72 || 	On seeing him, Lakṣmī suddenly got down from her elephant with the garland of forest flowers (still in her hands). With a broad smile, she put round the neck of the Supreme Being Viṣṇu, the garland that was wreathed by Śrī herself and wherein bees swarmed together. 
vāmāṃgamāśritya tadā mahātmanaḥ sopāviśattatra samīkṣya tā ubhau | surāḥ sadaityā mudamāpuradbhutāṃ siddhāpsaraḥ kiṃnaracāraṇāśca || 73 || 	73. She then sat there leaning on the left side of the great Ātman. On seeing them both, Suras and Daityas experienced a wonderful joy. So also Siddhas, Apsarās (celestial damsels), Kinnaras and Cāraṇas. 
sarveṣāmeva lokānāmaikapadyena sarvaśaḥ | harṣo mahānabhūttatra lakṣmīnārāyaṇāgame || 74 || lakṣmyā vṛto mahāviṣṇurlakṣmīstenaiva saṃvṛtā | evaṃ parasparaṃ prītyā hyavalokanatatparau || 75 || 	74. At that union of Lakṣmī and Nārāyaṇa, the delight of everyone was very great. All the worlds, all the people everywhere were simultaneously happy and joyous. 75. Mahāviṣṇu was sought and wooed by Lakṣmī. Lakṣmī was wooed by him alone. Thus through mutual love they became absorbed in looking at each other. 
śaṃkhāśca paṭahāścaiva mṛdaṃgānakagomukhāḥ | bheryaśca jharjharīṇāṃ ca sa śabdastumulo'bhavat || 76 || 	76. The sound of the various musical instruments and drums sucḥ as Paṭahas, conchs, Mṛdaṅgas, Ānakas, Gomukhas, Bherīs and Jharjharīs was very tumultuous. 
babhūva gāyakānāṃ ca gāyanaṃ sumahattadā | tatāni vitatānyena ghānāni suṣirāṇi ca || 77 || evaṃ vādyaprabhedaiśca viṣṇuṃ sarvātmanā harim | atoṣayansugītajñā gaṃdharvāpsarasāṃ gaṇāḥ || 78 || tathā jagurnāradatuṃburādayo gaṃdharvayakṣāḥ surasiddha saṃghāḥ | saṃsevamānāḥ paramātmarūpaṃ nārāyaṇaṃ devamagādhabodham || 79 || 	77-79. The songs of the musicians were immensely splendid. With the four types of musical instruments, viz. Tata, Vitata, Ghana and Suṣira, the groups of Gandharvas and celestial damsels propitiated the all-pervading Lord Hari in every way. Gandharvas, being proficient in the art of music delighted the lord. Nārada, Tumburu and other Gandharvas and Yakṣas then sang sweetly. The groups of Suras and Siddhas served thus lord Nārāyaṇa who is in the form of the Supreme Ātman and whose enlightenment was boundless, deep and profound. 
iti śrīskāṃde mahāpurāṇa ekāśītisāhasryāṃ saṃhitāyāṃ prathame māheśvarakhaṇḍe kedārakhaṇḍe samudramanthanākhyāne lakṣmīprādurbhāvavarṇanaṃnāmaikādaśo'dhyāyaḥ || 11 || 	Due to their negligence in worshipping Gaṇeśa, Asuras did not get the fruit (Ratnas—jewels) of their labour of churning the ocean. 
lomaśa uvāca | praṇamya paramātmānaṃ ramāyuktaṃ janārddanam | amṛtārthaṃ mamaṃthuste surāsuragaṇāḥ punaḥ || 1 || 	Notes: This chapter describes how Asuras were cheated by Viṣṇu by assuming the form of an enchantress and were deprived of their share of Amṛta. Lomaśa said: 1. After bowing down to Janārdana, the Supreme Being, along with Ramā, the groups of Suras and Asuras once again churned the ocean for the sake of Nectar. 
udadhermathyamānācca nirgataḥ sumahāyaśāḥ | dhanvaṃtaririti khyāto yuvā mṛtyuñjayaḥ paraḥ || 2 || 	2. From the ocean that was being churned, came out a youthful person of very great fame, well-known as Dhanvantari.[1] He was the great conqueror of Mṛtyu (Death). 
pāṇibhyāṃ pūrṇakalaśaṃ sudhāyāḥ parigṛhya vai | yāvatsarve surāḥ sarve nirīkṣaṃte manoharam || 3 || 	3-4. He held in his hands a pot filled with nectar. While all Suras were (gladly) looking at the fascinating Lord Dhanvantari, Daityas wanted to attack him in a body and snatch away the pot (of nectar) that had been held in the hands of Dhanvantari. 
yāvattaraṃgamālābhirāvṛto'bhūdbhiṣaktamaḥ | śanaiḥ śanaiḥ samāyāto dṛṣṭo'sau vṛṣaparvaṇā || 5 || 	5. The excellent physician surrounded by a series of waves was advancing slowly when he was seen by Vṛṣaparvan. 
karasthaḥ kalaśastasya hṛtastena balādiva | asurāśca tataḥ sarve jagarjuratibhīṣaṇam || 6 || 	6. The pot that was in his hand was forcibly taken by him (Vṛṣaparvā). Thereupon, Asuras roared in a terrific manner. 
kalaśaṃ sudhayā pūrṇaṃ gṛhītvā te samutsukāḥ | daityāḥ pātālamājagmustadā devā bhramānvitāḥ || 7 || 	7. Seizing and taking the pot filled with nectar, the impatient Daityas came down to Pātāla. Then Devas became confused and embarrassed. 
anujagmuḥ susaṃnaddhā yoddhukāmāśca taiḥ saha | tadā devānsamālokya balirevamabhāṣata || 8 || 	8. They (Devas) who were well-prepared and ready for a battle, pursued them with a desire to fight. Turning towards Devas, Bali spoke thus: 
baliruvāca | vayaṃ tu kevalaṃ devāḥ sudhayā paritoṣitāḥ | śīghrameva pragaṃtavyaṃ bhavadbhiśca surottamaiḥ || 9 || 	9. O Devas, we are contented and gratified with the nectar only. You excellent Suras do go back quickly. 
triviṣṭapaṃ mudā yuktaiḥ kimasmābhiḥ prayojanam | purāsmābhiḥ kṛtaṃ maitraṃ bhavadbhiḥ svārthatatparaiḥ | adhunā viditaṃ tattu nātra kāryā vicāraṇā || 10 || 	10. Please go back to Triviṣṭapa (Heaven) joyously. Of what avail are we to you? Formerly we entered into a friendly alliance with you only because we wanted to realize our common objectives. Now it has been known to you. Do not have any doubt in it hereafter. 
evaṃ nirbhārtsitāstena balinā surasattamāḥ | yathāgatena mārgeṇa jagmurnārāyaṇaṃ prabhum || 11 || 	11. Thus rebuked and repulsed by Bali, those excellent Suras went back to Lord Nārāyaṇa along the path by which they had come. 
taṃ dṛṣṭvā viṣṇunā sarve surā bhagnamanorathā | āśvāsitā vacobhiśca nānānunayako vidaiḥ || 12 || 	12. On meeting him, all the Suras whose desires were frustrated, were consoled by Viṣṇu with various kinds of words capable of pacifying them: 
mā trāsaṃ kurutātrārtha ānayiṣyāmi tāṃ sudhām | evamābhāṣya bhagavānmukundo'nāthasaṃśrayaḥ || 13 || sthāpayitvā surānsarvāṃstatraiva madhusūdanaḥ | mohanīrūpamāsthāya daityanāmagrato'bhavat || 14 || 	13-14. “In this matter, do not be afraid unnecessarily. I shall bring back the nectar”, said Lord Viṣṇu, the refuge of those who are helpless. The slayer of Madhu (Viṣṇu) having asked all the Suras to stay there itself, assumed the form of a charming lady, Mohinī, and appeared before Daityas. 
tāvaddaityāḥ susaṃrabdhāḥ parasparamathābruvan | vivādaḥ sarvadaityānāmamṛtārthe tadā'bhavat || 15 || 	15. By that time Daityas had become highly excited and agitated. They spoke to one another (about this). For the sake of nectar, all the Daityas began arguing with one another. 
evaṃ pravartamāne tu mohinīrūpamāśritām | dṛṣṭvā yoṣāṃ tadā daivātsarvabhūtamanoramām || 16 || vismayena samāviṣṭā babhūvustṛṣitekṣaṇāḥ | tāṃ saṃmānya tadā daityarājo baliruvāca ha || 17 || 	16-17. While this was going on, fortunately they saw a woman fascinating the minds of all living beings (who had assumed the form of Mohinī). They were struck with wonder and with covetous eyes (they staled at her). Honouring her, Bali, the king of Daityas, said: 
baliruvāca | sudhā tvayā vibhaktavyā sarveṣāṃ gatihetave | śīghratvena mahābhāge kuruṣva vacanaṃ mama || 18 || 	Bali said: 18. O highly fortunate lady, this nectar should be (properly) distributed by you, so that it can reach all. Be quick about it. Do as I request. 
evamuktā hyuvācedaṃ smayamānā baliṃ prati | strīṇāṃ naiva ca viśvāsaḥ kartavyo hi vipaścitā || 19 || 	19. On being requested thus, she smilingly said to Bali: “Women should never be trusted by a wise man.[2] 
anṛtaṃ sāhasaṃ māyā mūrkhatvamati lobhatā | aśaucaṃ nirghṛṇatvaṃ ca strīṇāṃ doṣāḥ svabhāvajāḥ || 20 || 	20. The following are the inherent natural defects of women: Falsehood, daring, deception, foolishness, excessive greed, uncleanliness and ruthlessness. 
niḥsnehatvaṃ ca vijñeyaṃ dhūrtatvaṃ caiva tattvataḥ | svastrīṇāṃ caiva vijñeyā doṣā nāstyatra saṃśayaḥ || 21 || 	21. Lack of genuine affection as well as mischievous cunningness should also be known as existing in them, in fact. These defects should undoubtedly be known as existing (even) in one’s own wives. 
yathaiva śvāpadānāṃ ca vṛkā hiṃsāparāyaṇāḥ | kākā yatāṃḍajānāṃ ca śvāpadānāṃ ca jaṃbukāḥ | dhūrtā tathā manuṣyāṇāṃ strījñeyā satataṃ budhaiḥ || 22 || 	22. Just as wolves among beasts of prey, crows among birds and foxes among wild animals are given to killing, so also women among human beings should always be understood by the wise as exceedingly mischievous and cunning. 
mayā saha bhavadbhiśca kathaṃ sakhyaṃ pravartate | sarvathātra na vijñeyāḥ ke yūyaṃ caiva ka hyaham || 23 || 	23. How can there be friendship and alliance between me and you all. Should this not be considered? Who are you and who am I? 
tasmādbhavadbhiḥ saṃciṃtyakāryākāryavicakṣaṇaiḥ | kartavyaṃ parayā buddhyā prayātāsurasattamāḥ || 24 || 	24. Hence everything should be done by you after careful consideration with your keen intellect. Of course, you are very efficient in knowing what should be done and what should not be done, O excellent Asuras.” 
baliruvāca | adyāmṛtaṃ ca sarveṣāṃ vibhajasva yathātatham | tvayā dattaṃ ca gṛhṇīmaḥ satyaṃsatyaṃ vadāmi te || 28 || 	27-29. “O lord, I shall follow your instructions whether they are good or bad.” Bali said: Today distribute the nectar among all in a befitting manner. We shall take what is given by you. It is true. I am speaking the truth. 
evamuktā tadā devī mohinī sarvamaṃgalā | uvācāthāsurānsarvānrocayaṃllaukikīṃ sthitim || 29 || 	On being told thus, goddess Mohinī who was auspicious in every respect, spoke to all the Asuras desirous of following the conventional propriety: The Lord (i.e. Mohinī) said: 
bhagavānuvāca | yūyaṃ sarve kṛtārthāśca jātā daivena kenacit | adyopāvāsasaṃyuktā amṛtasyādhivāsanam || 30 || kriyatāmasurāḥ śreṣṭhāḥ śubhecchā kiṃcidasti vaḥ | śvebhūte pāraṇaṃ kuryādvratārcanaratiśca vaḥ || 31 || nyāyopārjitavittena daśamāṃśena dhīmatā | kartavyo viniyogaśca īśaprītyarthahetave || 32 || 	30-32. By a stroke of good luck, all of you have become blessed and achieved your desired objective, O excellent Asuras. Do observe fast today and let the preliminary consecratory rite of the nectar be performed. Something is yet (to be observed) with a desire for your welfare. Tomorrow you can have the Pāraṇā (ceremonial breakfast). Your desire for observances and worships (is commendable). For the sake of propitiating Īśa, the Viniyoga (ceremonious disposal) rite should be performed by an intelligent (devotee) with a tenth part of the amount legally and justifiably earned by him. 
tatheti matvā te sarve yathoktaṃ devamāyayā | cakrustathaiva daiteyā mohitā nātikovidāḥ || 33 || 	33. Saying “So be it”, they all honoured whatever was said by Devamāyā. Deluded and not being very proficient and experienced, they did everything advised by Devamāyā. 
mayāsureṇa ca tadā bhavanāni kṛtāni vai | manojñāni mahārhāṇi suprabhāṇi mahāṃti ca || 34 || 	34. Very big, fascinating, lustrous and rich mansions were built by the Asura, Maya. 
teṣupaviṣṭāste sarve susnātāḥ samalaṃkṛtāḥ | sthāpayitvā susaṃrabdhāḥ pūrṇaṃ kalaśamagrataḥ || 35 || 	35. They sat in those abodes after taking bath and adorning themselves befittingly. Excited much, they placed the full pot (of nectar) in front of themselves. 
rātrau jāgaraṇaṃ sarvaiḥ kṛtaṃ paramayā mudā | athoṣasi pravṛtte ca prātaḥsnānayutā bhavan || 36 || 	36. With very great joy, all of them kept vigil during the night. At dawn, they engaged themselves in taking early morning ablutions. 
asurā balimukhyāśca paṃktibhūtā yatākramam | sarvamāvaśyakaṃ kṛtvā tadā pānaratā bhavan || 37 || 	37. After finishing all necessary daily routine duties, Asuras, the chief of whom was Bali, sat in rows in due order. They were eager to drink (the nectar). 
baliśca vṛṣaparvā ca namuciḥ śaṃkha eva ca | sudaṃṣṭraścaiva saṃhlādī kālanemirvibhīṣaṇaḥ || 38 || vātāpirilvalaḥ kumbho nikumbhaḥ pracchadastathā | tathā sundopasundau ca niśumbhaḥ śumbha eva ca || 39 || mahiṣo mahiṣākṣaśca biḍālākṣaḥ pratāpavān | cikṣurākhyo mahābāhurjṛbhaṇo'tha vṛṣāsuraḥ || 40 || 	38-41. The following were the important ones among Daityas etc.: Bali, Vṛṣaparvan, Narauci, Śaṅkha, Sudaṃṣṭra, Saṃhlādī, Kālanemi, Vibhīṣaṇa, Vātāpi, Ilvala, Kuṃbha, Nikuṃbha, Pracchada, Sunda, Upasunda, Niśuṃbha, Śuṃbha, Mahiṣa, Mahiṣākṣa, the valorous Biḍālākṣa, the mighty-armed Cikṣura, Jṛṃbhaṇa, Vṛṣāsura, Vibāhu, Bāhuka, Ghora, Ghoradarśana, Rāhu and Ketu. These and many other Daityas, Dānavas and Rākṣasas sat there in due order. 
teṣāṃ tu koṭisaṃkhyānāṃ daityānāṃ paṃktirāsthitā || 42 || tatastayā tadā devyā amṛtārthaṃ hi vai dvijāḥ | yajjātaṃ tacchṛṇaudhvaṃ hi tayā devyā kṛtaṃ mahat || 43 || 	42-43. There were rows and rows of those Daityas numbering crores and crores. Now, O Brāhmaṇas, listen to what happened thereafter and what great things were done by that goddess in the matter regarding (the distribution of) the nectar. 
sarve vijñāpitāḥ sadyo gṛhītakalaśā tadā | śobhayā parayā yuktā sākṣātsā viṣṇumohinī || 44 || karasthena tadā devī kalaśena virājitā | śuśubhe parayā kāṃtyā jaganmaṃgalamaṃgalā || 45 || 	44-45. All were informed by her immediately (to be ready). She took up the pot. That Viśvumohinī was endowed with the greatest splendour. The goddess appeared splendid with the pot resting in her hands. The (goddess) conducive to the auspiciousness of all auspicious things in the universe shone with the greatest lustre. 
pariveṣadharāḥ sarve surāste hyasurāṃtikam | āgatāstatkṣaṇādeva yatra te hyasurottamāḥ || 46 || 	46. At the very same instant, all the Suras who had halos around them, came to the place where those excellent Asuras were present. 
tāndṛṣṭvā mohinī sadya uvāca pramadottamā || 47 || 	47. On seeing them, Mohinī, the most excellent one among young women, said immediately: Mohinī said: 
mohinyuvāca | ete hyatithayo jñeyā dharmmasarvasvasādhanāḥ | ebhyo deyaṃ yatāśaktyā yadi satyaṃ vaco mama | pramāṇaṃ bhavatāṃ cādya kurudhvaṃ mā vilaṃbatha || 48 || 	48. These (people) should be known as guests. They are conducive to the accomplishment of every thing virtuous. If you keep the promise given to me, something should be given to these in accordance with your capacity. You are the authority in this regard. Do everything now. Do not delay. 
pareṣāmupakāraṃ ca ye kurvaṃti svaśaktitaḥ | dhanyāste caiva vijñeyāḥ pavitrāḥ lokapālakāḥ || 49 || 	49. Those who render help to others in accordance with their capacity are blessed ones. They should be known to be very pure and protectors of the worlds. 
tasmādvibhajanaṃ kāryaṃ mayaitasya śubhavratāḥ | devebhyaśca prayacchadhvaṃ yaddhi cātmapriyāpriyam || 51 || 	50-51. Those who endeavour only for (filling in) their belly should be known as destined to suffer. There is no doubt about this. Hence, O (friends) of auspicious rites, this should be divided by me. You give Devas whatever you like or dislike. 
ityukte vacane devyā tathā cakrurataṃ dritāḥ | āhvayāmāsurasurāḥ sarvāndevānsavāsavān || 52 || 	52. When these words were spoken by the goddess, the energetic and alert Asuras did so. The Asuras invited all Devas including Vāsava. 
upaviṣṭāśca te sarve amṛtārthaṃ ca bho dvijāḥ | teṣūpaviśyamāneṣu hyuvāca paramaṃ vacaḥ | mohinī sarvadharmmajñā asurāṇāṃ smayanniva || 53 || 	53. All of them sat, O Brāhmaṇas, for the sake of receiving the nectar. While they were occupying their seats, Mohinī who was conversant with all holy rites and virtuous acts, smilingly said to the Asuras these great words: 
mohinyuvāca | ādau hyabhyāgatāḥ pūjyā iti vai vaidikī śrutiḥ || 54 || 	Mohinī said: 
tasmādyūyaṃ vedaparāḥ sarve devaparāyaṇāḥ | bruvaṃtu tvaritenaiva ādau keṣāṃ dadāmyaham | amṛtaṃ hi mahābhāgā balimukhyā vadaṃtu bhoḥ || 55 || 	54-55. The Vedic Text prescribes that the guests should be honoured at the very outset. Hence, you who axe all devoted to the gods and the Vedas speak out immediately. So whom shall I give the nectar at the very outset? Indeed, let those whose leader is Bali, let those persons of exalted fortune say. 
balinoktā tadā devī yatte manasi rocate | svāminī tvaṃ na saṃdeho hyasmākaṃ suṃdarānane || 56 || 	56. Then the goddess was told by Bali. “(Do) what appeals to your mind. O lady of beautiful face, you are our mistress. There is no doubt about it.” 
evaṃ saṃmānitā tena balinā bhāvitātmanā | pariveṣaṇakāryārthaṃ kalaśaṃ gṛhya satvarā || 57 || 	57-58. On being honoured thus by that Bali of pure soul, the goddess hurriedly took up the pot for the purpose of serving. 
tasmānnarendrakarabhorulasaddṛkūlā śroṇītaṭālasagatirmavihvalāṃgī | sā kūjatī kanakanūpurasiṃjitena kuṃbhastanī kalaśapāṇirathāviveśa || 58 || 	A silk cloth shone over her thighs resembling the trunk of a royal elephant. She walked rather slowly on account of the (huge) buttocks. Her limbs were agitated and excited due to inebriation. With the tinkling of the golden anklets, she appeared to be cooing (like a cuckoo). Her breasts resembled pitchers. With the pot (of nectar) in her hand, she entered (the place where they were seated). 
tadā tu devī pariveṣayaṃtī sā mohinī devagaṇāya sākṣāt | vavarṣa deveṣu sudhārasaṃ punaḥ punaḥ sudhāhārarasāmṛtaṃ yathā || 59 || punaśca te devagaṇāḥ sudhārasaṃ dattaṃ tayā parayā viśvamūrtyā | balimukhyāḥ saha lokapālā gaṃdharvayakṣāpsarasāṃ gaṇāśca || 60 || 	59-60. Then the goddess Mohinī proceeded serving the group of Devas directly. She showered on Devas the juice of the nectar again and again as though their sole diet consisted of this nectar. The groups of Devas, the chief among whom was Devendra, and the groups of Gandharvas, Yakṣas and celestial damsels along with Guardians of the Quarters swallowed again and again the juice of nectar served by that great (goddess) of cosmic form. 
sarve daityā āsanasthā punaśca te devagaṇāḥ sudhārasaṃ dattaṃ pīḍitāśca | tūṣṇīṃbhūtā balimukhyā dvijeṃdrā manasvino dhyānaparā babhūvuḥ || 61 || 	61. All Daityas, the chief among whom was Bali, O leading Brāhmaṇas, continued to be seated there. They were anxious and afflicted with hunger. The resolute Daityas kept quiet and were engaged in meditation. 
tatastathāvidhāndṛṣṭvā daityāṃstānmohamāśritān | tadā rāhuśca ketuśca dvāvetau daityapuṃgavau || 62 || devānāṃ rūpamāsthāya amṛtārthaṃ tvarānvitau | upaviṣṭau tadā paṅktyāṃ devānāmamṛtārthinau || 63 || 	62 -63. On seeing those Daityas in such a plight after resorting to a delusion, the two leading Daityas Rāhu and Ketu assumed the forms of Devas and hurriedly sat in the row of Devas for receiving the nectar. 
yadāmṛtaṃ pātukāmo rāhuḥ paramadurjayaḥ | candrārkābhyāṃ prakathito viṣṇoramitatejasaḥ || 64 || tadā tasya śiraśchinnaṃ rāhordurvigrahasya ca | śivaro gaganamāpede kabaṃdhaṃ ca mahītale | bhramamāṇaṃ tadā hyadrīṃścūrṇayāmāsa vai tadā || 65 || 	64-65. The exceedingly invincible Rāhu was desirous of drinking the nectar. When this was reported to Viṣṇu of unmeasured splendour by the Sun and the Moon, the head of Rāhu of deformed body was cut off. The head went up into the sky. The headless body dropped down on the earth. Rolling down, it crushed many mountains into small particles. 
sādriśca sarvabhūlokaścūrṇitaśca tadā'bhavat | tayā tena ca dehena cūrṇitaṃ sacarācaram || 66 || dṛṣṭvā tadā mahādevastasyopari tu saṃsthitaḥ | nivāsaḥ sarvadevānāṃ tasyāḥ pādatale'bhavat || 67 || pīḍanaṃ tatsamīpetha nivāsa iti nāma vai || 68 || 	66-68. The entire world including the mountains was reduced to fine dust. On seeing that the entire universe consisting of mobile and immobile beings was smashed to fragments by her (i.e. Mohinī) through that body (of Rāhu), Mahādeva stood above it. The abode of all Devas was at the soles of her feet. The affliction (?) was near her, hence the name Nivāsa[3] (abode) (obscure). 
mahatāmālayaṃ yasmādyasyāstaccaraṇāṃbujam | mahālayeti vikhyātā jagattrayavimohinī || 69 || 	69. Since her lotus-like feet had been the abode (ālaya) of great ones (mahatām), the enchantress of the three worlds became reputed as Mahālayā. 
ketuśca dhūmarūpo'sāvākāśe vilayaṃ gataḥ | sudhāṃ samarpya caṃdrāya tirodhānagato'bhavat || 70 || 	70. Ketu vanished into the sky in the form of smoke. It was after handing over the nectar to the Moon that he vanished thus. 
vāsudevo jagadyonirjagatāṃ kāraṇaṃ param | viṣṇoḥ prasādāttajjātaṃ surāṇāṃ kāryasiddhidam || 71 || 	71. Vāsudeva is the origin of the universe. He is the supreme cause of all the worlds. It was due to Viṣṇu’s grace that everything took place favouring the realization of Devas’ objectives. 
asurāṇāṃ vināśāya jātaṃ daivaviparyayāt | vinā daivena jānīdhvamudyamo hi nirarthakaḥ || 72 || 	72. Since the fate was adverse, the enterprise of Mohinī was conducive to the destruction of Asuras. Understand that all exertions without (favourable) fate are useless. 
yaugapadyena taiḥ sarvaiḥ kṣīrābdhermaṃthanaṃ kṛtam | siddhirjātā hi devānāmasiddhirasurānprati || 73 || 	73. The churning of the ocean was conducted by all of them simultaneously. But, it ended in the success of Devas, while Asuras failed (in their objective). 
tataśca te devavarānprakopitā daityāśca māyāpravi mohitāḥ punaḥ | anekaśastrāstrayutāstadā'bhavanviṣṇau gate garjamānāstadānīm || 74 || 	74. Therefore, they were furious at the excellent Devas. Daityas who were deluded took up many weapons and missiles. When Viṣṇu went away they began to roar. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES: Dhanvantari: Mbh, Ādi 18.38 also states that Dhanvantari came out of ocean along with a pot of Amṛta. He is regarded as an incarnation of Viṣṇu. This divine physician Dhanvantari is different from Dhanvantari, the physician-king of Vārāṇasī. He learnt Āyurveda from sage Bharadvāja and composed a systematic work of eight parts on Āyurveda and taught it to different disciples (BdP II.3, 67.1-24). 
iti śrīskānde mahāpurāṇa ekāśītisāhasryāṃ saṃhitāyāṃ prathame māheśvarakhaṇḍe kedārakhaṃḍe samudramaṃthanākhyāne devānāmamṛtaprāśanavarṇanaṃnāma dvādaśo'dhyāyaḥ || 12 || 	These traditional verses are meant for creating disaffection about Saṃsāra. Mohinī (Viṣṇu) cleverly uses them to create confidence about her in the gullible Asuras. The whole chapter shows how Mohinī cunningly appeals to the noble qualities of Asuras and cheats them. 
lomaśa uvāca | tataste garjjamānāśca ākṣipaṃtaḥ surānraṇe | śatakratupramukhyāṃstanmahābalaparākramān || 1 || vimānamāruhya tadā mahātmā vairocaniḥ sarvabalena sārddham | daityaiḥ sameto vividhairmahābalaiḥ surānpradudrāva mahābhayāvaham || 2 || 	1-2. Then (those Asuras) roared at the Suras, the chief among whom was Indra, and whose strength and valour was great. They challenged them for a fight. The noble-souled son of Virocana got into his aerial chariot. He was accompanied by Daityas who were very powerful and who came in various (groups). With his entire army he rushed at Suras in a terrible way. 
svāni rūpāṇi bibhraṃtaḥ samāpetuḥ sa hasraśaḥ | kecidvyāghrānsamārūḍhā mahiṣāṃśca tathā pare || 3 || 	3. They had assumed their (original real) forms. They attacked (the enemies) in thousands. Some of them rode on tigers and others on buffaloes. 
mayūrānrājahaṃsāṃśca kukkuṭāṃśca tathā pare | keciddhayānsamārūḍhā uṣṭrānaśvatarānapi || 5 || gajānkharānpare caiva śakaṭāṃśca tathā pare | pādātā bahavo daityāḥ khaṅgaśaktyṛṣṭipāṇayaḥ || 6 || 	4-6. Some of them rode on horses, others on elephants; while some others rode on lions, panthers and śarabhas (eight-footed mythical animal), peacocks, royal swans, cocks, horses, elephants, camels, mules and asses. Some drove in carts. Many Daityas came on foot with swords, javelins and daggers in their hands. 
parighāyudhinaḥ pāśaśūlamudgarapāṇayaḥ | asilomānvitāḥ kecidbhuśuṃḍīparighāyudhāḥ || 7 || hayanāgarathāścānye samārūḍhāḥ prahāriṇaḥ | vimānāni samārūḍhā balimukhyāḥ sahasraśaḥ || 8 || 	7-8. There were demons with iron bars as weapons. Others had nooses, javelins and iron clubs in their hands. Some had thin-bladed swords. Others had bhuṣuṇḍī (a sort of missile) and iron bolts as their weapons. Others came on horses, chariots and elephants and began to strike. Thousands of Asuras, the chief among whom was Bali, rode in aerial chariots. 
sparddhamānāstatānyonyaṃ garjaṃtaśca muhurmuhuḥ | vṛṣaparvā hyuvā cedaṃ balinaṃ daityapuṃgavam || 9 || 	9. They vied with one another roaring frequently. Vṛṣaparvan then said to Bali, the leading Daitya: 
tvayā kṛtaṃ mahābāho iṃdreṇa saha saṃgamam | viśvāso naiva kartavyo durhṛdā ca kathaṃcana || 10 || 	10. “O mighty one, an alliance was entered into with Indra by you. One should not place too much of faith in an evil-minded person. 
ūnenāpi hi tucchena vairiṇāpi kathaṃcana | maitrī buddhimatā kāryā āpadyapi nivartate || 11 || 	11-12. By no means should one trust and enter into an alliance with a base person, even if one happens to be weak and inferior. Friendship must be formed with an intelligent person. In case of emergency (he will help one) to make the mishap ineffective. 
na viśvasetpūrvavirodhinā kvacitparājitāḥ smo'tha bale tvayādhunā | purāṇaduṣṭāḥ kathamadya vai punarmaṃtraṃ vikartuṃ na ca te yateran || 12 || 	One must not believe in a person who has been an enemy previously. It is because of you, O Bali, that we have been defeated now! Why should those chronic rogues not try to undo what has been agreed upon?” 
ityūcuste durādharṣā yoddhukāmā vyavasthitāḥ | dhvajaiśchatraiḥ patākaiśca raṇabhūmimamaṃḍayan || 13 || 	13. Those (sturdy Asuras) who could not be thwarted and were desirous of fighting said thus and arrayed themselves suitably. They adorned the battlefield with banners, umbrellas and flags. 
cāmaraiśca diśaḥ sarvā lopitaṃ ca raṇasthalam | tathā sarve surāstatra daityānprati samutsukāḥ || 14 || 	14-15. They covered all the quarters with chowries. The battlefield was completely covered up. 
pītvāmṛtaṃ mahābhāgā vāhānyāruhya daṃśitāḥ | gajārūḍho maheṃdropi vajrapāṇiḥ pratāpavān | sūryaścoccaiḥ śravārūḍho mṛgā rūḍhaśca candramāḥ || 15 || 	Similarly all Suras were also eager to (fight with) Daityas. Those persons of exalted fortune drank the nactar, put on the coats of mail and got on their respective vehicles. Mahendra, the valorous one with vajra (thunderbolt) in his hand, rode on his elephant. The Sun was seated on Uccaiḥśravas and the Moon rode on a deer. 
chatracāmarasaṃvītāḥ śobhitā vijayaśriyā | praṇamya viṣṇuṃ te sarva iṃdrādyā jayakāṃkṣiṇaḥ || 16 || 	16. They were equipped with umbrellas and chowries. They were rendered splendid by the martial glory born of victory. Desirous of victory, all those persons beginning with Indra bowed down to Viṣṇu. 
te viṣṇunā hyanujñātā asurānprati vai ruṣā | asurāśca mahākāyā bhīmākṣā bhīmavikramāḥ || 17 || teṣāṃ boramabhūdyuddhaṃ devānāṃ dānavaiḥ saha | tumulaṃ ca mahāghoraṃ sarvabhūtabhayāvaham || 18 || 	17-18. Permitted by Viṣṇu, they angrily (rushed at) Asuras. Asuras of huge body, terrible eyes and dreadful exploits (withstood them). The fight of Devas with Dānavas was very terrible, tumultuous and exceedingly dreadful, instilling fear into all living beings. 
śaradhārānvitaṃ sarvaṃ babhūva paramādbhutam | tataśca ṭacaṭāśabdā babhūvuśca diśodaśa || 19 || 	19-20. Arrows were continuously showered. Everything became excessively wonderful. The rough and harsh noise like Caṭacaṭā reverberated in all the ten directions. 
tato nimiṣamātreṇa śaraghātayutā bhavan | śaratomaranārācairāhatāścāpatanbhuvi || 20 || vidhyamānāstathā kecidvividhuścāparānraṇe | bhallairbhagnāśca patitā nārācaiḥ śakalīkṛtāḥ || 21 || 	Within a moment, they were wounded by arrows. Struck and hurt by arrows, iron clubs, javelins and iron-tipped missiles, they fell on the ground. 
kṣuraprahāritāḥ keciddaityā dānavarākṣasāḥ | śilīmukhairmāritāśca bhagnāḥ kecicca dānavāḥ || 22 || 	21-22. Even as they were being split and pierced, they split and tore others in the battle. They were shattered with Bhalla,1 arrows and smashed to pieces by Nārācas (iron-tipped arrows). Some of the Daityas, Dānavas and Rākṣasas were hit with many Kṣurapras (arrows with horseshoe-shaped tips) and they appeared to be torn with them. Some Dānavas were shattered and killed by Śilīmukhas (sharp-pointed arrows). 
evaṃ bhagnaṃ dānavānāṃ ca sainyaṃ dṛṣṭvā devā garjamānāḥ samaṃtāt | hṛṣṭāḥ sarve saṃmilitvā tadānīṃ labdhvā yuddhe te jayaṃ ślāghayante || 23 || 	23. On seeing the army of Dānavas broken up thus, Devas roared and moved all round. Delighted, they assembled together and celebrated the victory they had gained. 
śaṃkhavāditraghoṣeṇa pūritaṃ ca jagattrayam | devānprati kṛtāmarṣā dānavāste mahābalāḥ || 24 || baliprabhṛtayaḥ sarve saṃbhrameṇotthitāḥ punaḥ | vimānaiḥ sūryasaṃkāsairanekaiśca samanvitāḥ || 25 || dvaṃdvayuddhaṃ sutumulaṃ devānāṃ dānavaiḥ saha | saṃpravṛttaṃ punaścaiva parasparajigīṣayā || 26 || 	24-26. The three worlds were filled with the sounds of conchs and musical instruments. Dānavas of great strength became furious with Devas. Bali and all the others rose up once again with great excitement. They were equipped with many aerial chariots resembling the sun. With a desire to conquer each other Devas and Dānavas engaged themselves in tumultuous duels. 
balinā dānaveṃdreṇa maheṃdro yuyudhe tadā | tathā yamo mahābāhurnamucyā saha saṃgataḥ || 27 || 	27. Mahendra fought with Bali, the lord of Dānavas. Similarly, Yama of great and powerful arms met Namuci in combat.[1] 
nairṛtaḥ praghasenaiva pāśī kuṃbhena saṃgataḥ | nikuṃbhenaiva sumahadyuddhaṃ cakre sadārayaḥ || 28 || 	28. Nairṛta fought with Praghasa. Varuṇa clashed with Kuṃbha. Sadāraya (Wind-god) fought with Nikuṃbha. 
somena saha rāhuśca yuddhaṃ cakre sudāruṇam | rāhuṇā candradehotthamamṛtaṃ bhakṣitaṃ tadā | saṃparkādamṛsyaiva yathā rāhustathā'bhavat || 29 || 	29. Rāhu fought a very terrible combat with Soma (the Moon). The Amṛta (nectar) arising from the body of the Moon was imbibed by Rāhu. Due to the contact with nectar (another figure) like Rāhu rose up. 
tāni sarvāṇi dṛṣṭāni śaṃbhunā parameṣṭhinā | āśrayo'haṃ ca sarveṣāṃ bhūtānāṃ nātra saṃśayaḥ | asurāṇāṃ surāṇāṃ ca sarveṣāmapi vallabhaḥ || 30 || evamuktastadā rāhuḥ praṇamya śirasā śivam | maulau sthitastadā caṃdro amṛtaṃ vyasṛjadbhayāt || 31 || tena tasya hi jātāni śirāṃsi subahūnyapi | ekapadyena teṣāṃ ca srajaṃ kṛtvā manoharām | babaṃdha śaṃbhuḥ śirasi śirobhūṣaṇavatkṛtam || 32 || 	30-32. All these things were seen by Śaṃbhu, the great lord. “There is no doubt about this that I am the base and support of all living beings. I am affectionate and dear to all, Asuras as well as Suras.” On being told thus Rāhu bowed down to Śiva. The Moon stationed on his crest discharged nectar out of fear. On account of it, many such heads were produced simultaneously. Śaṃbhu made them into a beautiful garland and tied it to his head like a (decorative) head-ornament. 
aśanātkālakūṭasya nīlakaṃṭho'bhavattadā | devānāṃ kāryasiddhyarthaṃ muṃḍamālā tathā kṛtā || 33 || 	33. By swallowing Kālakūṭa for the purpose of accomplishing the objective of Devas, he became blue-throated with a garland of skulls (thus) made. 
dadhāra śirasā tāṃ ca muṇḍamālāṃ maheśvaraḥ || 34 || 	34. Maheśvara wore the garland of skulls. 
tayā srajā'sau śuśubhe mahātmā devādidevastripurāṃtako haraḥ | gajāsuro yena nipātito mahānathāṃdhako yena kṛtaśca cūrṇaḥ || 35 || 	35. By means of that garland shone the noble-souled Hara, the primordial lord of Devas, the destroyer of Tripura. He is the lord by whom the great demon Gaja (Elephant) was struck down and the huge (demon) Andhaka was reduced to dust. 
gaṃgā dhṛtā yena śirassumadhye caṃdraṃ ca cūḍe kṛtavānbhayāpahaḥ | vedāḥ purāṇāni tathāgamāśca tathaiva nānāśrutayo'tha śāstram || 36 || jalpaṃti nānāgamabhedairmīmāṃsamānāśca bhavaṃti mūkāḥ | nānāgamārcāyamataprabhedairnirūpyamāṇo jagadekabaṃdhuḥ || 37 || 	36-37. It was Śiva by whom Gaṅgā was held in the middle of his head. He, the dispeller of fear, kept the Moon on his crest. Vedas, Purāṇas, Āgamas, different kinds of Śrutis and scriptures argue and discuss variously in accordance with difference in their respective texts. In the course of their discussion they become dumb. Śiva, the sole friend of the universe, is being investigated and described differently according to the opinion of the preceptors of different Āgamas. 
śivaṃ hi nityaṃ paramātmadaivaṃ vedaikavedyaṃ paramātmadivyam | vihāya taṃ mūḍhajanāḥ pramattāḥ śivaṃ na jānaṃti parātmarūpam || 38 || 	38. Abandoning the eternal lord Śiva, the supreme spirit that could be comprehended only through the Vedas, deluded people commit blunders. They do not realize Śiva of the form of the Great Spirit. 
yenaiva sṛṣṭaṃ vidhṛtaṃ ca yena yena śritaṃ yena kṛtaṃ samagram | yasyāṃśabhūtaṃ hi jagatkadācidvedāṃtavedyaḥ paramātmā śivaśca || 39 || 	39. Śiva is the Paramātmā (Supreme Soul) by whom everything is created and sustained. He pervades everything and evolves everything. The entire universe is a part of this Lord. He may, perhaps, be comprehended through the Vedānta. 
āḍhyo vāpi daridro vā uttamo hyadhamo'pi vā | śivabhaktirato nityaṃ śiva eva na saṃśayaḥ || 40 || 	40. A person always engaged in devotion to Śiva is undoubtedly Śiva, whether he is rich or poor, noble or base. 
yo vā parakṛtāṃ pūjāṃ śivasyopari śobhitām | dṛṣṭvā saṃtoṣamāyāti dāyaṃ prāpnoti tatsamam || 41 || 	41. If a person becomes delighted on seeing the splendid worship of Śiva performed by others, he gets a gift (i.e. merit) equal to his (i.e. that of the worshipper). 
ye dīpamālāṃ kurvaṃti kārtikyāṃ śraddhayānvitāḥ | yāvatkālaṃ prajvalaṃti dīpāste liṃgamagrataḥ | tāvadyugasahasrāṇi dātā svarge mahīyate || 42 || 	42. People should offer rows of lamps in the month of Kārttika with great faith. A devotee who offers lamps thus is honoured in heaven for as many thousands of Yugas as the number (of hours) during which those lamps burn in front of the Liṅga.[2] 
kausuṃbhatailasaṃyuktā dīpā dattāḥ śivālaye | dātāraste'pi kailāse modante śivasaṃnidhau || 43 || 	43. If the lamps with safflower oil are offered in the temple of Śiva, those who offer them rejoice in Kailāsa in the presence of Śiva. 
atasītailasaṃyuktā dīpā dattāḥ śivālaye | te śivaṃ yāṃti saṃyuktāḥ kulānāṃ ca śatena vai || 44 || 	44. If the lamps with linseed oil are offered in the temple of Śiva, those who offer them rejoice in Kailāsa in the presence of Śiva. 
jñānino'pi hi jāyaṃte dīpadānaphalena hi || 45 || 	45-46. As a result of the offering of lamps, people become Jñānins (endowed with perfect knowledge). 
tilatailena saṃyuktā dīpā dattāḥ śivālaye | te śivaṃ yāṃti saṃyuktāḥ kulānāṃ ca śatena vai || 46 || 	If the lamps with gingelly oil are offered in the temple of Śiva, they (the offerers) go to Śiva in the company of a hundred members of their family. 
ghṛtāktā yaiḥ kṛtā dīpā dīpitāśca śivālaye | te yāṃti paramaṃ sthānaṃ kulalakṣasamanvitāḥ || 47 || 	47. Those by whom lamps are filled with ghee and lit in the temple of Śiva, go to the highest abode in the company of a hundred thousand members of own family. 
karpūrāgurudhūpaiśca ye yajaṃti sadā śivam | ārārtikāṃ sakarppūrāṃ ye kurvaṃti dinedine | te prāpnuvaṃti sāyujyaṃ nātra kāryā vicāraṇā || 48 || 	48. Those who worship Śiva always with camphor, aloe and incense and those who perform the rite of waving lights everyday along with camphor, attain Sāyujya (identity with the Divinity). There is no doubt about it. 
ekakālaṃ dvikālaṃ vā trikālaṃ ye hyataṃdritāḥ | liṃgārcanaṃ prakurvaṃti te rudrā nātra saṃśayaḥ || 49 || 	49. Those who worship the Liṅga once, twice or thrice a day with care are Rudras (themselves). There is no doubt about it. 
rudrākṣadhāraṇaṃ ye ca kurvaṃti śivapūjane | dāne tapasi tīrthe ca parvakāle hyataṃdritāḥ | teṣāṃ yatsukṛtaṃ sarvamanaṃtaṃ bhavati dvijāḥ || 50 || 	50. If the devotees wear Rudrākṣa beads[3] at the time of the worship of Śiva, when charitable gifts are offered, when penance is performed, in the holy spots and during festive occasions with care, their merit is infinite, O Brāhmaṇas. 
rudrākṣā ye śivenoktāstācchṛṇudhvaṃ dvijottamāḥ | ārambhaikamukhaṃ tāvadyābadvaktrāṇi ṣoḍaśa | eteṣāṃ dvau ca vijñeyau śreṣṭhau tārayituṃ dvijāḥ || 51 || 	51. Listen, O excellent Brāhmaṇas, to what Śiva has said about Rudrākṣa beads. There are Rudrākṣas with one face, two faces etc. up to sixteen faces- Among these, two should be known as the most excellent ones. O Brāhmaṇas, which redeem (devotees). 
rudrākṣāṇāṃ paṃcamukhakhastathā caikamukhaḥ smṛtaḥ | ye dhārayaṃtyekamukhaṃ rudrākṣamaniśaṃ narāḥ | rudralokaṃ ca gacchaṃti modante rudrasaṃnidhau || 52 || 	52. They are the five-faced Rudrākṣa and the single-faced Rudrākṣa. Those men who always wear the single-faced Rudrākṣa, go to the world of Rudra and rejoice in the presence of Rudra. 
japastapaḥ kriyā yogaḥ snānaṃ dānārcanādikam | kriyate yacchṛbhaṃ karmma hyanaṃtaṃ cākṣadhāraṇāt || 53 || 	53. Japa, penance, holy rites, yogic practice, holy bath, charitable gift, worship etc.—if these splendid rites are performed while wearing Rudrākṣa beads, these rites yield infinite results. 
śunaḥ kaṃṭhanibaddho'pi rudrākṣo yadi vartate | so'pi saṃtāritastena nātra kāryā vicāraṇā || 54 || 	54. If a Rudrākṣa bead is tied round the neck of even a dog, it will be redeemed thereby. There is no doubt about it. 
tathā rudrākṣasaṃbaṃdhātpāpamapikṣayaṃ vrajet | evaṃ jñātvā śubhaṃ karma kāryaṃ rudrākṣabaṃdhanāt || 55 || 	55. Due to the association of the Rudrākṣa bead one’s sin will be destroyed. Knowing this one should perform auspicious rites after wearing a Rudrākṣa bead. 
tripuṇḍradhāraṇaṃ yeṣāṃ vibhūtvā mantrapūtayā | te rudraloke rudrāśca bhaviṣyaṃti na saṃśayaḥ || 56 || 	56. If the devotees have Tripuṇḍra (three horizontal parallel lines on the forehead) (marked) with Vibhūti (sacred ash) sanctified by Mantras, they will undoubtedly become Rudras and (rejoice) in the world of Rudra. 
kapilāyāśca saṃgṛhya gomayaṃ cāṃtarikṣagam | śuṣkaṃ kṛtvātha saṃdāhyaṃ vibhūtyarthaṃ śivapriyaiḥ || 57 || 	57. The dung of a tawny-coloured cow should be gathered before it touches the ground. It must be dried and burned by the devotees of Śiva for preparing Vibhūti. 
vibhūtīti samākhyātā sarvapāpapraṇāśinī | lalāṭeṃ'guṣṭharekhā ca ādau bhāvyā prayatnataḥ || 58 || madhyamāṃ varjayitvā tu aṃgulīkdvayena ca | evaṃ trirekhāsaṃyukto lalāṭe yasya dṛśyate | sa śaivaḥ śivavajjñeyo darśanātpāpanāśanaḥ || 59 || 	58-59. It is called Vibhūti. It destroys all sins. At the outset, a single line should be drawn carefully with the thumb on the forehead. Then, two lines should be drawn, one above and one below the previous line by means of two fingers avoiding the middle finger. If the three lines are clearly visible on the forehead, that person is a devotee of Śiva. He should be known as the destroyer of sins by (his) mere sight, like Śiva. 
jaṭādharāśca ye śaivāḥ sapta paṃca tathā nava | jaṭā ye sthāpiyiṣyaṃti śaivena vidhinā yutāḥ || 60 || te śivaṃ prāpnuvaṃ tīha nātra kāryā vicāraṇā | rudrākṣadhāraṇaṃ kāryaṃ śivabhaktairviśeṣataḥ || 61 || 	60-61. Those devotees of Śiva who keep matted hair, keep five, seven or nine such clusters. Those who do so in accordance with the injunctions in Śaiva treatises, do attain Śiva. There is no doubt about this. Rudrākṣa beads should be worn particularly by Śiva’s devotees. 
alpena vā mahattvena pūjito vā sadāśivaḥ | kulakoṭiṃ samuddhṛtya śivena saha modate || 62 || 	62. Sadāśiva can be worshipped with a very little quantity (of materials) or with profusely rich material. The devotee redeems thereby ten million members of his family and rejoices with Śiva. 
tasmācchivātparataraṃ nāsti kiṃciddvijottamāḥ | yadaivamucyate śāstre tatsarvaṃ śivakāraṇam || 63 || 	63. Hence, O excellent Brāhmaṇas, there is nothing greater than Śiva. When this is told in the scripture (it must be known that), everything has Śiva for its cause. 
śivo dātā hi lokānāṃ kartā caivānumoditā | śivaśaktyātmakaṃ viśvaṃ jānīdhvaṃ hi dvijottamāḥ || 64 || 	64. Indeed Śiva is the bestower of the worlds. He is the maker of the worlds. He rejoices along with (his devotees). Know, O excellent Brāhmaṇas, that the whole universe consists of both Śiva and Śakti. 
śiveti dvyakṣaraṃ nāma trāyate mahato bhayāt | tasmācchivaściṃtyatāṃ vai smaryatāṃ ca dvijottamāḥ || 65 || 	65. The two-syllabled name Śi-va saves one from very great danger. Hence, O excellent Brāhmaṇas, let Śiva be contemplated upon and remembered. The sages said: 
ṛṣaya ūcuḥ | somanāthasya māhātmyaṃ jñātaṃ tasya prasādataḥ | rāhoḥ śirobhayātsarve rakṣitāḥ parameṣṭhinā || 66 || surāśceṃdrādayaścānye tasminyuddhe sudāruṇe | ata ūrdhvaṃ surāḥ sarve kimakurvata ucyatām || 67 || śivasya mahimā sarvaḥ śrutastava mukhodgataḥ | atha yuddhasya vṛttāntaḥ kathyatāṃ paramārthataḥ || 68 || 	66-68. The greatness of Somanātha has been understood. It was due to his grace that all were saved from the fear of the heads of Rāhu by Parameṣṭhin. Suras beginning with Indra and others (were saved by the lord) in that dreadful battle. Thereafter, what did all those Suras do? Let it be narrated. Everything about the greatness of Śiva as narrated by you was heard directly (while) uttered by you orally. Let the narration of the battle be made exactly as it happened. 
lomaśa uvāca | yadā hi daityaiśca parājitāḥ surāḥ śambhuṃ ca sarve śaraṇaṃ prapannāḥ | śivaṃ praṇemuḥ sahasā surottamā yuddhāya sarve ca mano dadhustadā || 69 || 	Lomaśa said: 69. When Suras were defeated by Daityas, all of them sought refuge in Śaṃbhu. The excellent Suras bowed down to Śiva. All of them immediately decided to fight. 
tathaiva daityā api yudhyamānā utsāhayuktātibalāśca sarve | devaiḥ sametāśca punaḥ punaśca yuddhaṃ pracakruḥ paramāstrayuktāḥ || 70 || 	70. Similarly, all Daityas who were very powerful and enthusiastic began to fight. Equipped with great missiles, they came into contact with Devas and fought again and again. 
evaṃ ca sarve hyasurāḥ surāśca śaktyṛṣṭiśūlaiḥ parighaiḥ paraśvadhaiḥ | jayārthinomarṣayutāḥ parasparaṃ siṃhā yathā haimavatīṃ durātyayāḥ | nihanyamānā hyasurāḥ suraistadā nānāstrayogaiḥ paramairnipetuḥ || 71 || 	71. Thus, all Suras and Asuras who were desirous of victory and who were exceedingly furious, fought with one another with javelins, swords, spears, iron bars and axes. Being struck down and hit by Suras with many great arrows and missiles combined with one another Asuras (though) indomitable fell down in the same manner as lions falling into Gaṅgā. 
cakruste sakalāmurvī māṃsaśoṇitakardamām | mahīṃ vṛkṣādrisaṃyuktāṃ sasāgaravanākarām || 72 || 	72. They made the entire earth muddy with flesh and blood. They made the entire earth including oceans, forests, mines, trees and mountains (full of blood and flesh). 
śirāṃsi ca kabandhāni kavacāni mahāṃti ca | dhvajārathāḥ patākāśca gajavājiśirāṃsi ca || 73 || 	73. Deep rivers of blood lashed and swept heads, headless bodies, great armours, flags, chariots, banners and heads of elephants and horses. 
bahantyaścāpagā hyāsannadyo bhīrubhayāvahāḥ | agādhāḥ śoṇitodāśca taraṃto brahmarākṣasāḥ | tayaṃti parānbhūtapratapramatharākṣasān || 74 || 	74. These rivers instilled fear into the minds of cowards. Brahmarākṣasas crossed these bloody rivers and made the other goblins, ghosts, Pramathas and Rākṣasas cross them. 
śākinīḍākinīsaṃghā yakṣiṇyo'tha sahasraśaḥ | nānākeliṣu saṃyuktāḥ parasparamudānvitāḥ || 75 || 	75. There were groups of female devils such as Śākinīs, Ḍākinīs etc. and thousands of Yakṣiṇīs. Rejoicing in the company of each other, they were engaged in various sports. 
evaṃ saṃkrīḍamānāste bhūtapramatharākṣasāḥ | raṇe tasminmahāraudre devāsurasamāgame || 76 || 	76. Thus, in that highly dreadful battle Devas and Asuras clashed directly with one another. There Bhūtas, Pramathas and Rākṣasas continued their sports. 
balinā saha devendro yuyudhe'dbhutavikramaḥ | śaktyā jaghāna deveṃdraṃ vairocaniramarṣaṇaḥ || 77 || 	77. Devendra of wonderful exploits fought with Bali. The infuriated son of Virocana (Bali) struck Devendra with a javelin. 
tāṃ śaktiṃ vañcayāmāsa mahendro laghuvikramaḥ | jaghāna sa baliṃ yatnāddaityeṃdraṃ parameṇa hi || 78 || vajreṇa śitadhāreṇa bāhuṃ ciccheda vikramī | gātāsurapatadbhūmau vimānātsūryasaṃnnibhāt || 79 || 	78-79. Mahendra of quick and nimble steps dodged that javelin. He struck Bali, the lord of Daityas, with great effort and force with his great thunderbolt of sharp edges The valorous (lord of Devas) cut off his (Bali’s) arms. (Thereupon) he fell down dead on the ground from his aerial chariot resembling the sun. 
patitaṃ ca baliṃ dṛṣṭvā vṛṣaparvā rūpānvitaḥ | vavarṣa śaradhārābhiḥ payoda iva parvatam || 80 || maheṃdraṃ sagajaṃ caiva sahamānaṃ śitāñcharān | tadā yuddhamabhūdvoraṃ mahendravṛṣaparvaṇoḥ || 81 || nipātya vṛṣaparvāṇamiṃdraḥ parabalārdanaḥ || 82 || 	80-81. On seeing Bali fallen, Vṛṣaparvan furiously showered Mahendra and his elephant with a volley of arrows like the cloud showering a mountain. Mahendra bore the sharp arrows. Then a terrible battle ensued between Mahendra and Vṛṣaparvan. 
tato vajreṇa mahatā dānavānavadhīdraṇe | śirasi ccheditāḥ kecitkecitkaṃdharato hatāḥ || 83 || vihvalāśca kṛtāḥ kecidiṃdreṇa kupitena ca | tathā yamena nihatā vāyunā varuṇena ca || 84 || kubereṇa hatāścānye nairṛtena tathā pare | agninā nihatāḥ kecidīśenaiva vidāritāḥ || 85 || 	82-85. Indra, the tormentor of the enemy’s army, caused Vṛṣaparvan to fall down. Then he killed Dānavas in the battle with his great thunderbolt. Some were pierced through the head. Some were hit in the neck. Some were rendered bewildered and afflicted by the furious Indra. Similarly, Dānavas were killed by Yama, Vayu and Varuṇa. Others were killed by Kubera and Nairṭta. Some were killed by Agni and torn asunder by Īśa 
evaṃ tadā tairnihatā balīyaso mahāsurā vikramaśāninaśca | suraistu sarvaiḥ saha lokapālaiḥ śivaprasādā bhihatāstadānīm || 86 || 	86. Thus the powerful Asuras of great exploit were killed by Suras and the guardians of the worlds. It was due to the favour of Śiva that they were killed then. 
tato mahādaityavaro durātmā sa kalānemiḥ paramāstrayuktaḥ | yayau tadānīṃ surasattamāṃstānhaṃtuṃ sadā krūramatiḥ sa ekaḥ || 87 || 	87. Then the great and excellent Daitya who was equipped with excellent missiles and weapons came in to kill the excellent Suras. The evil-minded demon who was very cruel in his heart advanced alone. 
siṃhārūḍho daṃśitaśca triśulena hi saṃyutaḥ | daityānāmarbudenaiva siṃhārūḍhena saṃvṛtaḥ || 88 || 	88. Armoured and armed with a trident, he rode on a lion surrounded by one hundred millions of Daityas, all riding on lions. 
te siṃhā daṃśitāḥ sarve mahābalaparākramāḥ | teṣu siṃheṣu cārūḍhā mahādaityāśca tatsamāḥ || 89 || 	89. All those lions of great strength and exploit were equipped with coats of mail. The great Daityas riding on those lions were also equal to them. 
āyāṃtīṃ daityasenāṃ tāṃ sarvāṃ siṃhavibhūṣitām | kālanemiyutāṃ dṛṣṭvā devā iṃdrapurogamāḥ | bhayamājagmuratulaṃ tadā dhyānaparā bhavan || 90 || 	90. On seeing the entire army of Daityas, that was adorned by lions and led by Kālanemi, advancing, the Devas with Indra, their leader, became exceedingly frightened. Then they began to ponder. 
kiṃ kurmo'dya vayaṃ sarve kathaṃ jeṣyāma cādbhutam | etādṛśamasaṃkhyākamanīkaṃ siṃhasaṃvṛtam || 91 || 	91. ‘What shall we all do now? How will we conquer this wonderful and countless army surrounded by lions?’ 
evaṃ viciṃtyamānāste hyāgatastatra nāradaḥ | nāradena ca tatsarvaṃ purāvṛttaṃ mahattaram || 92 || kathitaṃ ca maheṃdrāya kālanemestapobalam | ajeyatvaṃ ca saṃgrāme varadānabalena tu || 93 || 	92-93. When they were thinking thus, Nārada happened to come there. The old story of Kālanemi’s power of penance was told to Mahendra by Nārada. He told him about his invincibility in battle, by virtue of the power of boons granted to him. 
viṣṇuṃ vinā vayaṃ devā aśaktā raṇamaṃḍale | jetuṃ ca sa tato viṣṇuḥ smaryatāṃ parameśvaraḥ | tamālanīlo varadaḥ sarvairvijayakāṃkṣibhiḥ || 94 || 	94. “O Devas, we are not competent to conquer (this army) in the battle ground without Viṣṇu’s help. Hence, let the great lord Viṣṇu, the lord dark in complexion like the Tamāla leaves, the bestower of boons, be remembered by (all of you) desirous of conquest.” 
nāradasya vacaḥ śrutvā tadā devāstvarānvitāḥ | dhyānena ca mahāviṣṇuṃ tataḥ parabalārddanam | smaraṃtaḥ paramātmānamidamūcuśca taṃ vibhum || 95 || 	95. On hearing the words of Nārada, Devas hurriedly meditated on Mahāviṣṇu, the tormentor of the enemy’s army, the Supreme Soul. Remembering the lord, they prayed to him thus: Devas said: 
devā ūcuḥ | namastubhyaṃ bhagavate namaste viśvamaṃgalam | śrīnivāsa namastubhyaṃ śrīpate te namonamaḥ || 96 || 	96. Obeisance to you, the lord, the cause of the auspiciousness of the universe. O Śrīnivāsa (Abode of Śrī), obeisance to you. O Śrīpati (Consort of Goddess Lakṣmī), obeisance, obeisance to you. 
adyāsmānbhayabhītāṃstvaṃ kālanemibhayārditān | trātumarhasi daityācca devānāmabhayaprada || 97 || 	97. Today we are exceedingly frightened. We are oppressed by the fear of Kālanemi. It behoves you, O lord, the bestower of freedom from fear to Devas, to save us from the Daitya. 
evaṃ dhyātaḥ saṃsmṛtaśca prādurbhūto haristadā | nīlo garuḍamāruhya jagatāmabhayapradaḥ || 98 || 	98. On being meditated and remembered thus, the dark-complexioned Hari, the bestower of freedom from fear to all the worlds, appeared before them riding on Garuḍa. 
cakrapāṇistadāyāto devānāṃ vijayāya ca | gaganasthaṃ mahāviṣṇuṃ garuḍopari saṃsthitam | śrīvāsamenaṃ durddharṣaṃ yoddhukāmaṃ dadarśire || 99 || 	99. The lord with the discus in his hand came there for the victory of Devas. They all saw Mahāviṣṇu seated on Garuḍa and stationed in the firmament, the invincible lord Śrīvāsa (the resort of Śrī) who was desirous of fighting. 
tathā dṛṣṭvā kālanemistadānīṃ prahasyamāno'tiruṣā balānvitaḥ | kastvaṃ mahābhāga vareṇyarūpaḥ śyāmo yuvā vāraṇamattavikramaḥ | kare gṛhītaṃ niśitaṃ mahāprabhaṃ cakraṃ ca kasmātkathayasva me prabho || 100 || 	100. On seeing the lord like that, Kālanemi who was very mighty and highly infuriated, said laughingly (loudly): “Who are you, O exalted one of great fortune? You are excellent in form and features. You are young and dark-complexioned and possess the valour of an elephant in rut. A sharp-edged brilliant discus is held by you in your hand. Why? Let me know, O Lord.” 
śrībhagavānuvāca | yuddhārthamiha cāyāto devānāṃ kāryasiddhaye | tvaṃ sthiro bhava re maṃda dahāmyadya na saṃśayaḥ || 101 || 	The Lord said: 101. I came here for the purpose of fighting, for the fulfilment of the cause of Devas. Be steady, O stupid one, I shall undoubtedly burn you now. 
śrutvā bhagavato vākyaṃ kālanemiḥ pratāpavān | uvāca ruṣito bhūtvā bhagavaṃtamadhokṣajam || 102 || 	102. On hearing the words of the Lord, the valorous Kālanemi became angry and said to lord Adhokṣaja (Viṣṇu): 
mūlabhūto hi devānāṃ bhagavānyuddhadurmadaḥ | yuddhaṃ kuru mayā sārddhaṃ yadi śūro'si saṃprati || 103 || 	103. “You are the lord and root-cause of Devas. You are highly proud of your ability to fight. If you are a brave warrior, fight with me now.” 
prahasya bhagavānviṣṇuruvācedaṃ mahāprabhaḥ | gaganastho bhava tvaṃ hi mahīstho'haṃ bhavāmi vai || 104 || apraśastaṃ ca viṣamaṃ yuddhaṃ caiva yathā bhavet | tathā kuru mahābāho gagano vā mahītale || 105 || 	104-107. Lord Mahāviṣṇu of great lustre laughed and said: “Either you be stationed in the sky, or I shall be stationed on the earth. O mighty one, fight either in the sky or on the ground, so that the battle will not be on uneven planes and blameworthy.” 
tatheti matvā hi mahānubhāvo daityaiḥ sameto'rbudasaṃkhyakaiśca | siṃhoparisthaiśca mahānubhāvairmahābalaiḥ krūrataraistadānīm || 106 || gaganamatha jagāhe maṃdamaṃdaṃ mahātmā hyasuragaṇasameto viśvarūpaṃ jighāṃsuḥ | triśikhamaparamugraṃ gṛhya saṃdeśaceṣṭādaśanavikṛtavaktro yoddhukāmo hariṃ saḥ || 107 || 	Saying “So be it” the Daitya of great mangificence, surrounded by one hundred million Daityas who were dignified and glorious and seated on lions, who were powerful and ruthless, rose up in the sky slowly. He was accompanied by the groups of Asuras. He was desirous of killing (Viṣṇu) the lord of cosmic form. He took up another fierce trident with a desire to fight with Hari. His mouth and face had a hideous form due to his (curved ferocious) teeth as well as (his desire to send) an oral message (to his followers). 
iti śrīskāṃde mahāpurāṇa ekāśītisāhasryāṃ saṃhitāyāṃ prathame māheśvarakhaṇḍe samudramaṃthanākhyāne devāsurasaṃgrāmavarṇanaṃnāma trayodaśo'dhyāyaḥ || 13 || 	Rudrākṣa is the ‘berry’ of Elaeocarpus ganitrus. It is of different kinds, ‘one-faced’, ‘five-faced’ etc. Genuine ‘one-faced’ Rudrākṣa is rare and is valued highly. VV 50-55 describe the spiritual importance of wearing Rudrākṣa.[Sanskrit text for this chapter is available] 
lomaśa uvāca | tato yuddhamatīvāsīdasurairviṣṇunā saha | tataḥ siṃhāḥ sapakṣāste daṃśitāḥ paramādbhutāḥ || 1 || asurairuhyamānāste rahutmaṃtaṃ vyadārayan | siṃhāste dāritāstena khaṃḍaśaśca vidāritāḥ || 2 || 	1-2. Then the fight between Asuras and Viṣṇu became exceedingly terrific. The exceedingly wonderful winged lions equipped with armours and ridden by Asuras tore up Garuḍa. The lions too were pierced and torn to pieces by him. 
viṣṇunā ca tadā daityāścakreṇa śakalīkṛtāḥ | hatāṃstānasurāndṛṣṭvā kālanemiḥ pratāpavān || 3 || triśūlenāhanadviṣṇuṃ roṣaparyākulekṣaṇaḥ | tamāyāṃtaṃ ca jagṛhe mukuṃdo'nāthasaṃśrayaḥ || 4 || 	3-4. Then Daityas were cut into pieces by Viṣṇu with his discus. On seeing Asuras killed, the valorous Kālanemi, with his eyes full of wrath, struck Viṣṇu with his trident. Mukunda (Viṣṇu), the support of those who are helpless, caught hold of the trident as it rushed at him. 
kareṇa vāmena jaghāna līlayā taṃ kālanemiṃ hyasuraṃ mahābalam | tenaiva śūlena samāhato'sau mūrcchānvito'sau sahasā papāta || 5 || 	5. Viṣṇu playfully caught hold of Kālanemi, the Asura of great power with his trident, by his left hand sportively. Being struck with the self-same trident, he suddenly fell down senseless. 
patitaḥ punarutthāya śanairunmīlya locane | purataḥ sthitamālokya viṣṇuṃ sarvaguhāśayam || 6 || 	6-7. The fallen Daitya came to senses again and slowly opened his eyes. Regaining consciousness, he saw Yiṣṇu standing in front of him—Viṣṇu, the lord abiding in the cavity of the heart of everyone. Kālanemi of great strength then spoke these words: 
labdhasaṃjño'bravīdvākyaṃ kālanemirmahābalaḥ | tava yuddhaṃ na dāsyāmi nāsti loke spṛhā mama || 7 || 	“I will not offer to fight with you, I have no desire for worlds (and worldly pleasures). 
ye ye'surā hatā yuddhe akṣayaṃ lokamāpnuyuḥ | brahmaṇo vacanātsadya iṃdreṇa saha saṃgatāḥ || 8 || bhuṃjato vividhānbhogāndevavadvicaraṃti te | iṃdreṇa sahitāḥ sarve saṃsāre ca pataṃtyatha || 9 || 	8-9. According to the words of Brahmā, those Asuras who are killed in the battle will attain the Akṣaya (Everlasting) world. Immediately they will come into contact with Indra. Enjoying various kinds of worldly pleasures, they will roam about like gods along with Indra. Then they will fall down to the earthly world. 
tasmādyuddhena maraṇaṃ na kāṃkṣe kṣaṇabhaṃguram | anyajanmani me vīra vairabhāvānna saṃśayaḥ | dātumarhasi me nātha kaivalyaṃ kevalaṃ param || 10 || 	10. Hence, I do not desire death in battle. It is of a momentary nature. O heroic lord, it behoves you to grant me Kaivalya (salvation) alone, the great benefit, in the course of my next birth, of course, as a result of an inimical attitude.” 
tatheti daityapravaro nipātitaḥ pareṇa puṃsā paramārthadena | dattvā'bhayaṃ devatānāṃ tadānīṃ tathā sudhāṃ devatābhyaḥ pradattvā || 11 || 	11. Saying “So be it”, the Supreme Being, the bestower of the greatest benefit, caused the excellent Daitya to fall down. Having given Sudhā (nectar) to Devas (before) and having granted freedom from fear to Devas (now) (the lord saved them). 
kālanemirhato daityo devā jātā hyakaṭakāḥ | śalyarūpo mahānsadyo viṣṇunā prabhaviṣṇunā || 12 || 	12. Kālanemi, the great Daitya who was like a dart, was killed by Viṣṇu, the powerful lord. Devas became rid of thorns (enemies). 13-14. The lotus-eyed Lord vanished immediately. 
tirodhānaṃ gataḥ sadyo bhagavānkamalekṣaṇaḥ | iṃdro'pi kadanaṃ kṛtvā daityānāṃ paramādbhutam || 13 || patitānāṃ klībarūpāṇāṃ bhagnānāṃ bhītacetasām | muktakacchaśikhānāṃ ca cakre sa kadanakriyām || 14 || 	Having caused extremely wonderful (terrific) havoc among Daityas, Indra also continued the slaughter of Daityas who were fallen, cowardly like eunuchs, broken (in spirit) and frightened in mind, and had their garments and tufts of hair loosened. 
arthaśāstraparo bhūtvā maheṃdro durātikramaḥ | daityānāṃ kālarūpo'sau śacīpatirudāradhīḥ || 15 || 	15. The liberal-minded consort of Śacī (Indra), who was like the god of Death unto Daityas and who could never be conquered (did all these things), because, he was devotedly following the (instructions laid down in the) Arthaśāstra.[1] 
evaṃ nihanymānānāmasurāṇāṃ śacīpateḥ | nivāraṇārthaṃ bhagavānāgato nāradastadā || 16 || 	16. While Asuras were being killed like this, the holy lord Nārada came there in order to make Indra desist from it. 
nārada uvāca | yuddhahatāśca ye vīrā hyasurā raṇamaṇḍale | teṣāmanu kathaṃ kartā bhītānāṃ ca vihiṃsanam || 17 || 	Nārada said: 17. Many heroic Asuras have been killed fighting in the battlefield. Why do you kill the frightened ones after that? 
ye bhītāṃśca prapannāṃścaghātayaṃti madoddhatāḥ | brahmaghnāste'pi vijñeyā mahāpātakasaṃyutāḥ || 18 || 	18. The haughty and arrogant ones who cause the death of those who are afraid and those who seek refuge should be known as murderers of Brāhmaṇas. They are guilty of great sins. 
tasmāttvayā na karttavyaṃ manasāpi vihiṃsanam | evamuktastadā śakro nāradena mahātmanā || 19 || surasenānvitaḥ sadya āgato hi triviṣṭapam | tadā sarve suragaṇāḥ suhṛdbhyaśca parasparam | babhūvurmuditāḥ sarve yakṣagaṃdharvakiṃnarāḥ || 20 || 	19-20. Hence, even mentally injury should not be caused by you. On being told thus by the noble-souled Nārada, Indra immediately came back to Triviṣṭapa (heaven) accompanied by the armies of Suras. Then all the groups of Suras, all the Yakṣas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras became joyous. Along with their friends, they enjoyed the company of one another. 
tadā iṃdro'marāvatyāṃ hasa śacyā'bhiṣecitaḥ || 21 || devarṣipramukhaiścaiva brahmarṣipramukhaistathā | śakro'pi vijayaṃ prāptaḥ prasādācchaṃkarasya ca || 22 || 	21-26a. Then Indra was crowned in Amarāvatī along with Śacī by leading celestial sages and leading Brāhmaṇa sages. It was due to the favour of Śaṅkara that Śakra attained victory. 
tadā mahotsavo viprā devaloke mahānabhūt | śaṃkhāśca paṭahāścaiva mṛdaṃgā murajā api | tathānakāśca bheryaśca nedurduṃdubhayaḥ samam || 23 || gāyakāścaiva gaṃdharvāḥ kinnarāścāpsapogaṇāḥ | nanṛturjagustuṣṭuvuśca siddhacāraṇaguhyakāḥ || 24 || 	Then, O Brāhmaṇas, there was a great celebration in the world of Devas. Then conchs and different kinds of drums like Paṭahas, Mṛdaṅgas, Murajas, Ānakas, Bherīs and Dundubhis were sounded simultaneously. Gandharvas and Kinnaras were the musicians. The groups of celestial damsels danced. Siddhas, Cāraṇas and Guhyakas sang praises. 
evaṃ vijayamāpannaḥ śakro devesvarastadā | devairhatāstadā daityāḥ patitāste mahītale || 25 || 	Thus Śakra, the lord of Devas, attained victory. 26b-27a. At that time, the noble-souled Daityas, the chief among whom was Bali and who had been killed by Devas, fell down lifeless on the surface of the earth. 
gatāsavo mahātmāno balipramukhato hyamī | tapastaptuṃ purā vipro bhārgavo mānasottaram || 26 || 	Formerly the Brāhmaṇa Bhārgava (accompanied by his disciples) had gone to mount Mānasottara for performing penance. Hence he was not aware of that battle. 
gataḥ śiṣyaiḥ parivṛtastasmādyuddhaṃ na veda tat | avaśeṣāśca ye daityāste gatā bhārgavaṃ prati || 27 || kathitaṃ vai mahaddhṛttamasurāṇāṃ kṣayāvaham | niśamya manyumāviṣṭo hyāgato bhṛgunaṃdanaḥ || 28 || śiṣyaiḥ parivṛto bhūtvā mṛtāṃstānasurānapi | vidyayā mṛtajīvinyā patitānsamajīvayat || 29 || 	27b-29. Those Daityas who had survived approached Bhārgava. The news of the great destruction of Asuras was conveyed to him. On hearing it, the son of Bhṛgu became furious. He returned surrounded by his disciples. With the Vidyā (magic formula) called Mṛtajīvinī (‘Resuscitator of the dead’), he revived the Asuras who had fallen dead. 
nidrāpāyagatā yadvadutthitāste tadā'surāḥ | utthitaḥ sa baliḥ prāha bhārgavaṃ hyamitadyutim || 30 || 	30. Then those Asuras got up as though they had awakened from sleep. Bali who rose up, said to Bhārgava of unmeasured splendour: 
jīvitena kimadyaiva mama nāsti prayojanam | pātitastridaśeṃdreṇa yathā kāpuruṣastathā || 31 || 	31. “Of what avail is it to me today to be revived back to life? There is no benefit to me. I have been struck down by the lord of Devas like a mean contemptible wretch.” 
balinoktaṃ vacaḥ śrutvā śukro vacanamabravīt | manasvino hi ye śūrāḥ pataṃti samare budhā || 32 || ye śastreṇa hatāḥ sadyo mriyamāṇā vrajaṃti vai | triviṣṭapaṃ na saṃdeha iti vedānuśāsanam || 33 || 	32-33. On hearing the words uttered by Bali, Śukra spoke these words: “Those heroic persons who are high-souled and intelligent, who are learned, and who fall down dead in battle on being struck by a weapon go to heaven. This is undoubtedly the statement of the Vedas.” 
evamāśvāsayāmāsa balinaṃ bhṛgunaṃdanaḥ | tapastatāpa vividhaṃ daityānāṃ siddhidāyakam || 34 || 	34. Thus, the son of Bhṛgu consoled Bali. He then performed various kinds of penance conducive to the achievement of Siddhis by Daityas. 
tathā daitya gatāḥ sarve bhṛguṇā ca pracoditāḥ | pātālamavasansarve balimukhyāḥ sukhena vai || 35 || 	35. All the Daityas urged by Bhṛgu went to Pātāla. All the Daityas, the chief among whom was Bali, stayed in Pātāla in happiness. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES: Arthaśāstra—A treatise on political economy. It is the title of a famous work of Kauṭilya or Ārya Cāṇakya who masterminded the revolution in Pāṭalīputra (Magadha), uprooted the Nanda dynasty and installed Candragupta Maurya as the King. Kauṭilya refers to many predecessors. Hence the Arthaśāstra mentioned here may be a more ancient work than that of Kauṭilya.[Sanskrit text for this chapter is available] 
| ṛṣaya ūcuḥ | rājyaṃ prāpto hi deveṃdraḥ kathitaste guruṃ vinā | guroravajñayā jāto rājyabhraṃśo hi tasya tu || 1 || kena praṇoditaśceṃdro babhūva ciramāsane | tatsarvaṃ kathayāśu tvaṃ paraṃ kautūhalaṃ hi naḥ || 2 || 	The sages enquired: 1-2. It has been mentioned by you that Devendra regained kingdom without his preceptor. It was on account of disrespect to his preceptor that he had been dethroned from his kingdom. Urged by whom did he retain his position for a long time? Do tell us all these things quickly. We are very eager to hear it. 
lomaśa uvāca | guruṇāpi vinā rājyaṃ kṛtavānsa śacīpatiḥ | viśvarūpoktavidhinā iṃdro rājye sthito mahān || 3 || 	Lomaśa replied: 3-4. The consort of Śacī (Indra) ruled over the kingdom (of heaven) without his preceptor (Bṛhaspati). The great Indra (could) continue (to rule) over the kingdom due to the (religious) performance in accordance with the injunctions of Viśvarūpa. 
viśvakarmasuto viprā viśvarūpo mahānṛpaḥ | purohito'tha śakrasya yājakaścābhavattadā || 4 || 	5-6. O Brāhmaṇas, Viśvarūpa,[1] a great king, was the son of Viśvakarmā. He became the preceptor and performer of sacrifices for Śakra. 
tasminyajñe'vadānaiśca yajane asurānsurān | manuṣyāṃścaiva triśirā aparokṣaṃ śacīpateḥ || 5 || 	In that Yajña, Triśiras (one with three heads) performed the worship with partial oblations separately for Asuras, Suras and human beings. 
devāndadāti sākrośaṃ daityāṃstūṣṇīmathādadāt | manuṣyānmadhyapātena pratyahaṃ sa grahāndvijaḥ || 6 || 	In the direct presence of Indra everyday he used to give ladles (full of Soma) to Devas with a loud shout, to Daityas silently, and to human being in a fallen middle tone. 
ekadā tu maheṃdreṇa sūcito gurulāghavāt | alakṣyamāṇena tadā jñātaṃ tasya cikīrṣitam || 7 || 	7-8. Once he was detected due to his partiality (regarding relative importance of oblations) by Indra who remained concealed and unobserved. Then the desired object (of Triśiras) was understood (by Indra). 
daityānāṃ kāryasiddhyarthamavadānaṃ prayacchati | asau purohito'smākaṃ pareṣāṃ ca phalapradaḥ || 8 || 	(Deveṇdra thought) ‘He is making this piecemeal offering for the sake of accomplishing the task of Daityas. He is our preceptor, but gives the benefit to (our) enemies.’ 
iti matvā tadā śakro vajreṇa śataparvaṇā | ciccheda tacchirāṃsyeva tatkṣaṇādabhavadvadhaḥ || 9 || 	9. After thinking thus, Śakra cut off his heads instantaneously by means of his Vajra (thunderbolt) of hundred spikes. The death was instantaneous. 
yenākarotsomapānamajāyaṃta kapiṃjalāḥ | tatonyena surāpānātkalaviṃkā bhavanmukhāt || 10 || anyānanādajāyaṃta tittirā viśvarūpiṇaḥ | evaṃ hato viśvarūpaḥ śakreṇa maṃdabhāginā || 11 || 	10-11. The Kapiñjala (a sort of partridge) birds were born from the face with which he drank Soma juice. Then from the other face with which-he drank liquor, the Kalaviṅka (sparrow) birds were born. From the other (third) face, the Tittira birds of various forms were born. Thus, Viśvarūpa was killed by Śakra, the ill-fated one. 
brahmahatyā tadodbhūtā durdharṣā ca bhayāvahā | durdharṣā durmukhā duṣṭā caṇḍālarajasānvitā || 12 || 	12-14. The female fiend (born of and called) Brahmahatyā (‘Brāhmaṇa-murder’) manifested there. She was terrific and unthwartable. She was evil-faced, wicked, full of Cāṇḍāla impurity and could not be blocked or defeated. 
brahmahatyā surāpānaṃ steyaṃ gurvaṃganāgamaḥ | ityeṣāmapyaghavatāmidameva ca niṣkṛtiḥ || 13 || 	The terrible sinners are those who slay Brāhmaṇas, those who drink liquor, those who steal (gold etc.) and those who defile and outrage the modesty of the preceptor’s wife. The means of expiation for these sinners is the utterance of the names of Viṣṇu, since the mind has him for its object. 
nāmavyāharaṇaṃ viṣṇoryatastadviṣayā matiḥ | triśirā dhūmrahastā sā śakraṃ grastumupāyayau || 14 || 	The three-headed fiend with smoke-coloured hands rushed forth to swallow Indra. 
tato bhayena mahatā palāyanaparo'bhavat | palāyamānaṃ taṃ dṛṣṭvā hyanuyātā bhayāvahā || 15 || 	15. Thereupon (Indra) fled from there out of great fear. On seeing him fleeing, the terrible (devil) chased him. 
yato dhāvati sā'dhāvattiṣṭhaṃtamanutiṣṭhati | aṃgakṛtā yathā chāyā śakrasyapariveṣṭitum | āyāti tāvatsahasā iṃdro'pyapsu nyamajjata || 16 || śīghratvena yathā viprāściraṃtanajalecaraḥ || 17 || 	16-17. Wherever he ran, she too ran after him. If he stood anywhere, she too stood beside him. She behaved in the manner of a shadow of one’s own body. When she came so close as to envelop him, Indra sank beneath the waters suddenly, O Brāhmaṇas, like an old aquatic being. 
evaṃ divyaśataṃ pūrṇaṃ varṣāṇāṃ ca śacīpateḥ | vasatastasya duḥkhena tathā caiva śatadvayam | arājakaṃ tadā jātaṃ nākapṛṣṭhe bhayāvaham || 18 || tadā ciṃtānvitā devā ṛṣayo'pi tapasvinaḥ | trailokyaṃ cā'padā grastaṃ babhūva ca tadā dvijāḥ || 19 || 	18-19. Thus three hundred divine years passed since the consort of Śacī (Indra) began staying (beneath the waters) with great misery. A terrific state of anarchy spread throughout heaven. Thereupon Devas, sages and ascetics became anxious and worried. All the three worlds were overwhelmed by adversity, O Brāhmaṇas. 
eko'pi brahmahā yatra rāṣṭre vasati nirbhayaḥ | akālamaraṇaṃ tatra sādhūnāmupajāyate || 20 || 	20. Even if there is a single Brāhmaṇa-slayer in a kingdom staying there with impunity, untimely death of good men will take place there. 
rājā pāpayuto yasminrāṣṭre vasati tatra vai | durbhikṣaṃ caiva maraṇaṃ tathaivopadravā dvijāḥ || 21 || 	21. The king of the state wherein he (the Brāhmaṇa-slayer) lives, becomes contaminated by the sin. There will be (prevalence of) famine, death and calamities. 
bhavaṃti bahavo'narthāḥ prajānāṃ nāśahetave | tasmādrājñā tu kartavyo dharmmaḥ śraddhāpareṇa hi || 22 || 	22. There will be many misfortunes causing the destruction of the subjects. Hence, Dharma should be practised by a king with great faith. 
tathā prakṛtayo rājñaḥ śucajitvena pratiṣṭhitāḥ | indreṇa ca kṛtaṃ pāpaṃ tena pāpena vai dvijāḥ | nānāvidhairmahātāpaiḥ sopadravamabhūjjagat || 23 || 	23. Similarly, the ministers of the king too should be installed with purity. Sin was committeed by Indra and due to that sin, O Brāhmaṇas, the whole of the universe met with calamities along with great distress of diverse kinds. 
śaunaka uvāca | aśvamedhaśatenaiva prāptaṃ rājyaṃ mahattaram | devānāmakhilaṃ sūta kasmādvighramajāyata | śakrasya ca mahābhāga yathāvatkathayasva na || 24 || 	Śaunaka enquired: 24. It was by performing a hundred horse-sacrifices that the great realm of Devas was acquired by him, O Sūta. Why then did Śakra meet with obstacles, O highly fortunate one? Do tell us exactly as it happened. 
sūta uvāca | devānāṃ dānavānāṃ ca manuṣyāṇāṃ viśeṣataḥ | karmmaiva sukhaduḥkhānāṃ hetubhūtaṃ na saṃśayaḥ || 25 || 	Sūta replied: 25. In the case of Devas, Dānavas and particularly that of human beings, Karman alone is undoubtedly the cause of happiness and misery. 
indreṇa ca kṛtaṃ viprā mahadbhūtaṃ jugupsitam | guroravajñā ca kṛtā viśvarūpavadhaḥ kṛtaḥ || 26 || gautamasya guroḥ patnī sevitā tasya tatphalam | prāptaṃ maheṃdreṇa ciraṃ yasya nāsti pratikriyā || 27 || 	26-27. An immensely reprehensible act has been committed by Indra, O Brāhmaṇas, He insulted his Guru (preceptor Bṛhaspati). Viśvarūpa was slain. The wife of Gautama, his Guru (preceptor, elderly one), was carnally approached. It was the fruit of all these sins that was reaped by Mahendra for a long time. There was no way of atonement for the same. 
ye hi dṛṣkaṭatakarmmāṇo na kurvaṃti ca niṣkṛtim | durdaśāṃ prapnuvantyete yathaivendraḥ śatakratuḥ || 28 || 	28. If persons committing wicked and sinful deeds, do not perform expiatory rites (for the same), they do incur miseries just like Indra, (though) he had performed a hundred sacrifices. 
duṣkṛtopārjitasyā taḥ prāyāścittaṃ hi tatkṣaṇāt | kartavyaṃ vidhivadviprāḥ sarvapāpopaśāṃtaye || 29 || 	29. If sins are committed, atonement should be performed instantaneously in accordance with the injunctions, O Brāhmaṇas, for the sake of quelling all the sins. 
tataḥ svadharmaniṣṭhāṃ ca ye kurvaṃti sadā narāḥ | prātarmadhyāhnasāyāhne teṣāṃ pāpaṃ vinaśyati || 31 || prāpnuvaṃtyuttamaṃ lokaṃ nātra kāryā vicāraṇā | tasmādasau durācāraḥ prāpte vai karmaṇaḥ phalam || 32 || 	30-32. If minor sins are repeatedly performed, they turn into major sins. Those men who steadfastly cling to their duties of the morning, midday and dusk can get their sins destroyed. They attain the excellent world. There is no doubt about it. Hence, this person of evil conduct (i.e. Indra) reaped the fruit of his karman. 
sa pradhārya tadā sarve lokapālāstvarānvitāḥ | bṛhaspatimupāgamya sarvamātmani dhiṣṭhitam | kathayāmāsuravyagrā iṃdrasya ca guruṃ prati || 33 || 	33. All the Guardians of the Quarters hurriedly deliberated together. They approached Bṛhaspati and reported to the preceptor about Indra everything they had in their mind. 
devairuktaṃ vaco viprā niśamya ca bṛhaspatiḥ | arājakaṃ ca saṃprāptaṃ ciṃtayāmāsa buddhimān || 34 || 	34. On hearing the words uttered by Devas, Bṛhaspati, the intelligent (preceptor), thought about the anarchy that had begun to spread. 
kiṃ kāryaṃ cādya kartavyaṃ kathaṃ śreyo bhaviṣyati | devānāṃ cādya lokānāmṛṣīṇāṃ bhāvitātmanām || 35 || manasaiva ca tatsarvaṃ kāryākāryaṃ vicārya ca | jagāma śakraṃ tvarito devaiḥ saha mahāyaśāḥ || 36 || 	35-36. ‘What shall be done now? How will they secure welfare—Devas, the worlds and sages of sanctified souls?’ In his mind, he thought over the details of what should and what should not be done. Accompanied by Devas, the preceptor of great fame went to Indra. 
prāpto jalāśayaṃ taṃ ca yatrāste hi puraṃdaraḥ | yasya tīre sthitā hatyā caṃḍālīva bhayāvahā || 37 || 	37. They reached the lake where Purandara (Indra) was lying (hidden) and on the bank of which was staying the (devil of) Brāhmaṇa slaughter terrible like a Caṇḍālī. 
tatroviṣṭāste sarve devā ṛṣigaṇānvitāḥ | āhvānaṃ ca kṛtaṃ tasya śakrasya guruṇā svayam || 38 || 	38. All the Devas, accompanied by the groups of sages sat there. Then Śakra was called by the preceptor himself. 
samutthitastataḥ śakro dadarśa svaguruṃ tadā | bāṣpapūritavaktro hi bṛhaspatimabhāṣata || 39 || 	39. Thereupon, Indra got up and saw his preceptor. With tears flowing over his face, he spoke to Bṛhaspati. 
praṇipatya ca tatratyānkṛtāñjalirabhāṣata | tadā dīnamukho bhūtvā manasā saṃvimṛśya ca || 40 || svayameva kṛtaṃ pūrvamajñānalakṣaṇaṃ mahat | adhunaiva mayā kāryaṃ kiṃ kartavyaṃ vada prabho || 41 || 	40-41. He bowed down to all the persons assembled there. He pondered over the great (blunders) committed by himself before, as a result of ignorance. He joined his palms in reverence and with a piteous face spoke: “O Lord, tell me what should be done by me just now?” 
prahasyovāca bhagavānbṛhaspati rudāradhīḥ | purā tvayā kṛtaṃ yacca tasyedaṃ karmaṇaḥ phalam || 42 || māṃ ca uddiśya bho iṃdra tadbhogādeva saṃkṣayaḥ | prāyaścitaṃ hi hatyāyā na dṛṣṭaṃ smṛtikāribhiḥ || 43 || 	42-43. The holy lord Bṛhaspati of liberal mind laughed and said: “O Indra, this is the result of that act of yours committed previously against me. Only by experiencing its result, can it be annihilated. But, no atonement for Brāhmaṇa-slaughter has been seen (i.e. laid down) by the authors of Smṛti texts. 
ajñānato hi yajjātaṃ pāpaṃ tasya pratikriyā | kathitā dharmmaśāstrajñaiḥ sakāmasya na vidyate || 44 || 	44. Expiation has been prescribed by those conversant with Dharma Śāstras (Code of Laws) for the sin committed unknowingly. There is no atonement for an offence wilfully committed. 
sakāmena kṛtaṃ pāpamakāmaṃ naiva jāyate | tābhyāṃ viṣayabhedena prāyaścittaṃ vidhīyate || 45 || 	45. A sin committed by a person intentionally does not become one committed unintentionally. Expiation is laid down for both based on the differences in the objects. 
maraṇāṃto vidhiḥ kāryo kāmena hi kṛtena hi | ajñānajanite pāpe prāyaścittaṃ vidhīyate || 46 || 	46. If a sin is committed wilfully (deliberately), the expiation is to be performed up to death. Atonement is laid down in case of sins committed unknowingly. 
tasmāttvayā kṛtaṃ yacca svayameva hato dvijaḥ | purohitaśca vidvāṃśca tasmānnāsti pratikriyā || 47 || 	47. Since this has been intentionally done by you, since the twice-born, the learned priest has been killed, there is no atonement. 
yāvanmaraṇamapyeti tāvadapsu sthiro bhava || 48 || 	48. Stay in the waters here and wait for your death. 
śatāśvamedhasaṃjñaṃ ca yatphalaṃ tava durmate | tannaṣṭaṃ tatkṣaṇādeva ghātito hi dvijo yadā || 49 || 	49. The meritorious deed of yours termed ‘performance of one hundred horse-sacrifices’, O evil-minded one, has already been destroyed at the very moment when the twice-born was killed by you. 
sacchidre ca yathā toyaṃ na tiṣṭhati ghaṭe'ṇvapi | tathaiva sukṛtaṃ pāpe hīyate ca pradakṣiṇam || 50 || 	50. Just as not a drop of water remains in a pot with holes, similarly meritorious deeds of a sinner go on reducing every moment. 
tasmācca daivasaṃyogātprāptaṃ svargādikaṃ ca yaiḥ | yathoktaṃ tadbhavetteṣāṃ dharmiṣṭhānāṃ na saṃśayaḥ || 51 || 	51. Hence, by good luck, if heaven etc. are attained, those can be retained only by really righteous ones. There is no doubt about it.” 
etacchrutvā vacastasya śakro vacanamabravīt | kukarmaṇā madīyena prāptametanna saṃśayaḥ || 52 || 	52. On hearing his statement, Indra spoke these words: “Undoubtedly this has fallen to my lot through my own misdeeds. 
amarāvatī māśu tvaṃ gaccha devarṣibiḥ saha | lokānāṃ kāryasiddhyarthe devānāṃ ca bṛhaspate | iṃdraṃ kuru mahābhāga yaste manasi rocate || 53 || 	53. Hasten to Amarāvatī along with the celestial sages, O Bṛhaspati. For the purpose of accomplishing the tasks of the worlds as well as of Devas, O sage of great fortune, crown as Indra, anyone whom you approve in your mind. 
yathā mṛtastathā haṃ vai brahmahatyāvṛto mahān | rāgadveṣasamutthena pāpenāsmi pariplutaḥ || 54 || 	54. Enveloped by the great devil of Brahmahatyā, I am just like one who is dead. I have been overwhelmed by the sin arising from Rāga (attachment) and Dveṣa (hatred). 
tasmāttvarānvitā yūyaṃ devarājānamāśuḥ vai | kurvatu madanujñātāḥ satyaṃ prativadāmi vaḥ || 55 || 	55. Hence hasten all of you to make someone king of Devas. You have my permission for the same. I am speaking the truth to you.” 
evamuktāstadā sarve bṛhaspatipurogamāḥ | etyāmarāvatīṃ tūrṇaṃ puraṃdaraviceṣṭitam | kathayāmāsuravyagrā śacīṃ prati yathā tathā || 56 || 	56. On being told thus, all those (Devas) with Bṛhaspati at their head came to Amarāvatī immediately and coolly told Śacī everything about Indra’s activities as they had taken place. 
rājyasya hetoḥ kiṃ kāryaṃ vimṛśaṃtaḥ parasparam || 57 || 	57. They consulted one another and began to deliberate thus: ‘What should be done for the sake of the kingdom?’ 
evaṃ vimṛśyamānānāṃ devānāṃ tatra nāradaḥ | yadṛcchayāgatastatra devarṣiramitadyutiḥ || 58 || 	58. While Devas were thus deliberating, Nārada, the celestial sage of unmeasured splendour, came there by chance. 
uvāca pūjito devānkasmādyūyaṃ vicetasaḥ | tenoktāḥ kathayāmāsuḥ sarvaṃ śakrasya ceṣṭitam || 59 || 	59. On being honoured, he asked Devas: “Why are you all sad and perplexed?” On being enquired (thus) they spoke everything about Śakra’s activities: 
gatamiṃdrasya ceṃdratvamenasā parameṇa tu | tataḥ provāca tāndevāndevarṣirnārado vacaḥ || 60 || 	60. “Indra’s status of being the lord (of Devas) has come to an end on account of a great sin.” Thereupon Nārada, the celestial sage, spoke these words to those Devas: 
yūyaṃ devāśca sarvajñāstapasā vikrameṇa ca | tasmādiṃdro hi kartavyo nahuṣaḥ somavaṃśajaḥ || 61 || so'sminrāṣṭre pratiṣṭhāpyastvaritenaiva nirjarāḥ | ekonamaśvamedhānāṃ śataṃ tena mahātmanā | kṛtamasti mahābhāgā nahuṣeṇa ca yajvanā || 62 || 	61-62. “You are omniscient Devas endowed with the power of penance and valour. Hence Nahuṣa,[2] born in the Lunar race, should be made Indra. He should be established in this realm, O Devas, immediately. Ninety-nine horse-sacrifices have been performed by that noble-souled Nahuṣa, O highly fortunate ones. Nahuṣa was a regular performer of Yajñas 
śacyā śrutaṃ ca tadvākyaṃ nāradasya mukhodgatam | gatāṃtaḥpuramavyagrā bāṣpapūritalocanā || 63 || 	63-67. That statement coming out of the mouth of Nārada was heard by Sacī. With her eyes filled with tears and not engaged in anything (seriously), she went into the inner apartment. 
nāradasya vacaḥ śrutvā sarve devānvamodayan || 64 || nahuṣaṃ rājyamāroḍhumaikapadyena te yadā | ānīto hi tadā rājā nahuṣo hyamarāvatīm || 65 || rājyaṃ dattaṃ maheṃdrasya suraiḥ sarvairmaharṣibhiḥ | tadāgastyādayaḥ sarve nahuṣaṃ paryupāsata || 66 || 	On hearing the words of Nārada, all the Devas congratulated him. They approved of his suggestion to make Nahuṣa the ruler of the realm unanimously. Then, king Nahuṣa was brought to Amarāvatī and the kingdom of Mahendra was given to him by all the Suras and great sages. 
gaṃdharvāpsaraso yakṣā vidyādharamahoragāḥ | yakṣāḥ suparṇāḥ patagā ye cānye svargavāsinaḥ || 67 || 	Then all of them served Nahuṣa. Agastya and others (sages), Gandharvas, Apsarās, Yakṣas, Vidyādharas, the great serpents, Rākṣasas, the birds of bright wings (suparṇas like Garuḍa) and other heaven-dwellers (served him). 
tadā mahotsavo jāto devapuryāṃ niraṃtaraḥ | śaṃkhatūryamṛdaṃgāni nedurduṃdubhayaḥ samam || 68 || 	68. Then in the city of Devas, there was a continuous grand celebration. Concḥs, musical instruments, Mṛdaṅgas and Dundubhis sounded simultaneously. 
gāyakāśca jagustatra tathā vādyāni vādakāḥ | nartakā nanṛtustatra tathā rājyamahotsave || 69 || 	69. In that grand celebration of the kingdom of Devas, musicians sang songs, players of instruments played on them and dancers danced. 
abhiṣiktastadā tatra bṛhaspatipurogamaiḥ || 70 || 	70. Then he was coronated there by the sages, of whom Bṛhaspati was the foremost. 
arcito devasūktaiśca yathā vadgrahapūjanam | kṛtavāṃścaiva ṛṣibhirvidvadbhirbhāvitātmabhiḥ || 71 || 	71. He was worshipped with Deva-Sūkta and was made to perform the worship of Planets in due procedure and with formalities. 
tathā ca sarvaiḥ paripūjito mahānrājā surāṇāṃ nahuṣastadānīm | iṃdrāsane ceṃd samānarūpaḥ saṃstūyamānaḥ parameṇa varcasā || 72 || 	72. The great king Nahuṣa was duly honoured and respected by the learned sages of sanctified souls and by all others also. As the king of Suras, he sat on the throne of Indra. He had the same features as those of Indra. Endowed with the greatest splendour, he was eulogized by all. 
sugaṃdhadīpaiśca suvāsasā yuto'laṃkārabhogaiḥ suvirājitāṃgaḥ | babhau tadānīṃ nahuṣo munīdraiḥ saṃstūyamāno hi tathā'mareṃdraiḥ || 73 || 	73. Dressed in excellent sweet-scented bright garments and with his person adorned excellently with ornaments and articles of enjoyment, Nahuṣa appeared resplendent as he was being eulogized by prominent sages and leading Devas. 
iti paramakalānvito'sau suramunivaragaṇaiśca pūjyamānaḥ | nahuṣanṛpavaro'bhavattadānīṃ hṛdi mahatā hṛcchayenataptaḥ || 74 || 	74. Thus the great king Nahuṣa who was endowed with great ingenuity and worshipped by groups of great Devas and sages, became severely tormented at heart by intense passion (lust). 
nahuṣa uvāca | iṃdrāṇī kathamadyaiva nāyāti mama sannidhau | tāṃ cāhvayata śīghraṃ bho mā vilaṃbitumarhatha || 75 || 	Nahuṣa said: 75. How is it that Indrāṇī does not come near me? Call her quickly. It does not behove you to delay. 
nahupasya vacaḥ śrutvā bṛhaspatirudāradhīḥ | śacībhavanamāsādya uvāca ca savistaram || 76 || 	76. On hearing the words of Nahuṣa, the liberal-minded Bṛhaspati went to Śacī’s abode and spoke in detail: 
śakrasya durnimittena hyanīto nahuṣo'tra vai | rājyārte bhāmini tvaṃ ca arddhāsanagatā bhava || 77 || 	77. “It was on account of the calamity fallen on Indra that Nahuṣa was brought here for the sake of the kingdom. O beautiful lady, occupy half of his seat.” 
śacī prahasya covāca bṛhaspatimakalmaṣam | asau na paripūrṇo hi yajñaiḥ śakrāsane sthitaḥ | ekonamaśvamedhānāṃ śataṃ kṛtamanena vai || 78 || tasmānna yogyo prahasya covāca bṛhaspatimakalpaṇaṣam | asau na paripūrṇo hi yajñaiḥ śakrāsane sthitaḥ | avāhyavāhanenaiva atrāgatya labheta mām || 79 || 	78-79. Śacī laughed and spoke to sinless Bṛhaspati: “He has occupied the seat of Indra without completing the quota of (hundred) Yajñas. Only ninety-nine horse-sacrifices have been performed by him. Hence, he is not qualified enough to obtain me. Let this be thought over truthfully. If this senseless fellow still continues to be desirous of me, wife of another person, let him obtain me by coming here by means of a vehicle that is carried by undeserving carriers.” 
tatheti gatvā tvarito bṛhaspatiruvāca tam | nahuṣaṃ kāmasaṃtaptaṃ śacyoktaṃ ca yathātatham || 80 || 	80. Saying “So be it”, Bṛhaspati returned hurriedly to Nahuṣa who had been distressed through intense lust. He reported to him what was spoken by Śacī in her own words. 
tatheti matvā rājāsau nahuṣaḥ kāmamohitaḥ | vimṛśya parayā buddhyā avāhyaṃ kiṃ praśasyate || 81 || sa buddhyā ca ciraṃ smṛtvā brāhmaṇāścatapasvinaḥ | avāhyāśca bhavaṃtyasmādātmānaṃ vāhayāmyaham || 82 || dvābhyāṃ ca tasyāḥ prāptyarthamiti me hṛdi vartate | śibikāṃ ca dadau tābhyāṃ dvijābhyāṃ kāmamohitaḥ || 83 || 	81-84. Saying “So be it”, Nahuṣa who was deluded by lust, thought over it. He deliberated on this intelligently: ‘Who can be the carrier not worthy of being so?’ After thinking about it intelligently and trying to remember for a long time (he decided thus): “The Brāhmaṇas and the ascetics are not usually thought of as carriers. I shall make two of them bear me in order to reach her. This is my decision.” So (the king) who was deluded by lust gave the palanquin to two Brāhmaṇas. 
upaviśya tadā tasyāṃ śivabikāyāṃ samāhitaḥ | sarpasarpeti vacanānnodayāmāsa tau tadā || 84 || 	Seated in that palanquin with great concentration, he urged them on with the words “Sarpa, sarpa” (Move on, move on). (Sarpa means ‘serpent’ also.) 
agastyaḥ śibikāvāhī tataḥ kruddho'śapannṛpam | viprāṇāmavamaṃtā tvamunmatto'jagaro bhava || 85 || 	85. Agastya who had been one of the palanquin-bearers became infuriated and cursed the king. “You are a lunatic and despiser of Brāhmaṇas; you be a python.” 
śāpoktimātrato rājā patito brāhmaṇasya hi | tatraivājagaro bhūtvā vipraśāpo duratyayaḥ || 86 || 	86. Immediately, after the utterance of the curse by the Brāhmaṇa, the king became a python and fell from there itself. Indeed the curse of a Brāhmaṇa is untransgressable. 
yathā hi nahuṣo jātastathā sarve'pi tādṛśāḥ | viprāṇāmavamānena patinti niraye'śucau || 87 || 	87. Just as Nahuṣa became (a python), so also all like him fell into dirty hell by disrespecting Brāhmaṇas. 
tasmāsarvaprayatnena padaṃ prāpya vicakṣaṇaiḥ | apramattairnarairbhāvyamihāmutra ca labdhaye || 88 || 	88. Hence, in order to attain benefits here and hereafter, a wise, circumspect person who has achieved a position of importance, should refrain in all possible ways from committing blunders. 
tathaiva nahuṣaḥ sarppo jātoraṇye mahābhaye | evaṃ caivābhavattatra devaloke hyarājakam || 89 || 	89. Nahuṣa became a serpent in a very dreadful forest. Hence there prevailed anarchy in the world of Devas. 
tathaiva te surāḥ sarve vismayāviṣṭacetasaḥ | aho bata mahatkaṣṭaṃ prāptaṃ rājñā hyanena vai || 90 || 	90. Similarly, all the Devas were struck with consternation. “Alas! What a wretched condition the king has fallen into! 
na martya loko na svargo jāto hyasya durātmanaḥ | satāmavajñayā sadyaḥ sukṛtaṃ dagdhameva hi || 91 || 	91. This evil-minded fellow has obtained neither the mortal world nor the heavenly world. His (fund of) merits has been instantaneously burnt down, 
yājñiko hyaparo loke kathyatāṃ ca mahāmune | tadovāca mahātejā nārado munisattamaḥ || 92 || 	92. If there is any other person who has performed (many) Yajñas, let him be named, O great sage.” Then the excellent sage Nārada of great splendour said: 
yayātiṃ ca mahābhāgā ānayadhvaṃ tvarānvitāḥ | devadūtāstu vai tūrṇaṃ yayātiṃ drutamānayan || 93 || 	93. “O highly fortunate ones, hasten to bring Yayāti.[3]” Messengers of Devas went immediately and brought Yayāti quickly.
