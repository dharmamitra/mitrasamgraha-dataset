There is no self in this body, and, except for arbitrary insistence on self, ultimately no ‘I’ which can be said to be sick can be apprehended.

dharmā evotpadyamānā utpadyante / dharmā eva nirudhyamānā nirudhyante /	When it is born, only things are born when it ceases, only things cease.

tena samadarśinā nānyo vyādhir nānyā śūnyatā kartavyā / vyādhir eva śūnyatā /	Therefore, one who sees such sameness makes no difference between sickness and voidness his sickness is itself voidness, and that sickness as voidness is itself void.
aviditā ca sā vedanā veditavyā / na cānena vedanānirodhaḥ sākṣātkartavyaḥ /	“The sick bodhisattva should recognize that sensation is ultimately nonsensation, but he should not realize the cessation of sensation.
aparipūrṇeṣu buddhadharmeṣūbhe vedane notsraṣṭavye / na ca durgatyupapannānāṃ satvānām antike mahākaruṇā notpādayitavyā /	Although both pleasure and pain are abandoned when the buddhaqualities are fully accomplished, there is then no sacrifice of the great compassion for all living beings living in the bad migrations.
tathā kariṣyāmo yathaiṣāṃ satvānām evam ayoniśonidhyaptyā vyādhim apaneṣyāmaḥ /	Thus, recognizing in his own suffering the infinite sufferings of these living beings, the bodhisattva correctly contemplates these living beings and resolves to cure all sicknesses.

anuśaṃsadṛṣṭipatitayaiva hi mahākaruṇayā bodhisatvasya khedo bhavaty upapattiṣu /	Because great compassion that falls into sentimentally purposive views only exhausts the bodhisattva in his reincarnations.

He does not reincarnate through involvement with such views but reincarnates with his mind free of involvement.
