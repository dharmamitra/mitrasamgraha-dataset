niḥsārasakalārambhāḥ kāyāścapalavāyavaḥ / rajomārgeṇa gacchanto dṛśyante neha kenacit // 	Our bodies are as empty and fleeting as gusts of wind, passing over a dusty ground, where nobody knows whence they come, and whither they go.  
vāyordīpasya manaso gacchato jñāyate gatiḥ / āgacchataśca bhagavañcharīrasya kadācana // 	We know not the course of our bodies (their transmigrations), as we do not know those of the winds, light and our thoughts; they all come and go, but from where and whither, we know nothing of.

mithyājñānavikāre'sminsvapnasaṃbhramapattane / kāye sphuṭatarāpāye kṣaṇamāsthā na me dvija // 	I have not a moment's reliance in this body, which is ever hastening to decay;and I regard its changeful delusions as a state of dreaming.  
taḍitsu śaradabhreṣu gandharvanagareṣu ca / sthairyaṃ yena vinirṇītaṃ sa viśvasitu vigrahe // 	Let those who have any faith in the stability of the lightning, of the autumn clouds, and in glacial castles, place their reliance in this body.  
satatabhaṅgurakāryaparamparā vijayijātajayaṃ haṭhavṛttiṣu / prabaladoṣamidaṃ tu kalevaraṃ tṛṇamivāhamapohya sukhaṃ sthitaḥ // 	It has outdone all other things that are doomed to destruction in its instability and perishableness. It is moreover subject to very many evils; wherefore I have set it at naught as a straw, and thereby obtained my repose.

pratibimbaghanājñānaṃ nānāsaṃkalpapelavam / bālyamālūnasaṃśīrṇamanaḥ kasya sukhāvaham // 	How can boyhood be pleasing to any body, when it is but a semblance of gross ignorance, and full of whims and hobbies, and ever subject to miscarriages.  
jalavahnayanilājasrajātabhītyā pade pade / yadbhayaṃ śaiśave'buddhyā kasyāpadi hi tadbhavet // 	It is this silly boyhood which is in constant dread of dangers arising at every step from fire, water and air, and which rarely betide us in other states of life.  
līlāsu durvilāseṣu durīhāsu durāśaye / paramaṃ mohamādhatte bālo balavadāpatan // 	Boys are liable to very many errors in their plays and wicked frolics, and in all their wishes and attempts beyond their capacities:hence boyhood is the most perilous state.  
vikalpakalpitārambhaṃ durvilārasaṃ durāspadam / śaiśavaṃ śāsanāyaiva puruṣasya na śāntaye // 	Boys are engaged in false pursuits and wicked sports, and are subject to all foolish puerilities. Hence boyhood is fit for the rod and not for rest.  
ye doṣā ye durācārā duṣkramā ye durādhayaḥ / te sarve saṃsthitā bālye durgarta iva kauśikāḥ // 	All faults, misconduct, transgressions and heart-aches, lie hidden in boyhood like owls in hollow caves.  
bālyaṃ ramyamiti vyarthabuddhayaḥ kalpayanti ye / tānmūrkhapuruṣānbrahmandhigastu hṛtacetasaḥ // 	Fie to those ignorant and foolish people, who are falsely led to imagine boyhood as the most pleasant period of life.  
yatra dolākṛti manaḥ parisphurati vṛttiṣu / trailokyā'bhavyamapi tatkathaṃ bhavati tuṣṭaye // 	How can boyhood appear pleasing to any one, when the mind swings like a cradle towards every object of desire, however wrong it is deemed to be in both worlds.  
sarveṣāmeva sattvānāṃ sarvāvasthābhya eva hi / manaścañcalatāmeti bālye daśaguṇaṃ mune // 	The minds of all living beings are ever restless, but those of young people are ten times more at unrest.  
manaḥ prakṛtyaiva calaṃ bālyaṃ ca calatāṃ varam / tayoḥ saṃśliṣyatostrātā ka ivāntaḥ kucāpale // 	The mind is naturally unsteady, and so is boyhood also. Say what can save us from that state of life, when both these vagrant things combine to our destruction.  
strīlocanaistaḍitpuñjairjvalājālaistaraṅgakaiḥ / cāpalaṃ śikṣitaṃ brahmañchaiśavākrāntacetasaḥ // 	The glances of women, the flashes of lightning, the flame of fire, and the ever-rolling waves, have all imitated the fickleness of boyhood.  
śaiśavaṃ ca manaścaiva sarvāsveva hi vṛttiṣu / bhrātarāviva lakṣyete satataṃ bhaṅgurasthitī // 	Minority seems to be a twin brother to the mind, and resembles it in the unsteadiness and frailty of all its purposes.  
sarvāṇi duḥkhabhūtāni sarve doṣā durādhayaḥ / bālamevopajīvanti śrīmantamiva mānavāḥ // 	All kinds of miseries, misdeeds and miscarriages await on boyhood, as all sorts of men hang upon the rich.

bhayāhāraparaṃ dīnaṃ dṛṣṭādṛṣṭābhilāṣi ca / lolabuddhi vapurdhatte bālyaṃ duḥkhāya kevalam // 	Boys are subject to fear and voracity; they are helpless but fond of every thing they have seen or heard, and equally fickle in their bodies and mind. Hence boyhood is a source of troubles only.  
svasaṃkalpābhilaṣitānbhāvānaprāpya taptadhīḥ / duḥkhametyabalo bālo viniṣkṛtta ivāśaye // 	The foolish and helpless child, becomes as sad and sour when he fails to get the object of his fancy, as when he is thwarted from the thing desired.

bālo balavatā svena manorathavilāsinā / manasā tapyate nityaṃ grīṣmeṇeva vanasthalī // 	A boy is as much irritated by the eagerness of his whimsical desires, as a patch of ground in the desert is parched by the summer heat.  
vidyāgṛhagato bālo parāmeti kadarthanām / ālāna iva nāgendro viṣavaiṣamyabhīṣaṇām // 	A boy on entering his school, is subjected to corrections, which are as painful to him as the goading and fetters to the elephant.  
nānāmanorathamayī mithyākalpitakalpanā / duḥkhāyātyantadīrghāya bālatā pelavāśayā // 	A great many whims and hobbies, and a variety of false fancies, tend continually to afflict boyhood, which is ever fond of toys and trifles.  
saṃhṛṣṭo bhuvanaṃ bhoktamindumādātumambarāt / vāñchate yena maurkhyeṇa tatsukhāya kathaṃ bhavet // 	How can senseless childhood be said to be a happy state of life, when the child is led by its ignorance to swallow everything in the world, and to wish to lay hold on the moon in the sky.  
antaścitteraśaktasya śītātapanivāraṇe / ko viśeṣo mahābuddhe bālasyorvīruhastathā // 	Say great sage! what difference is there between a child and a tree, both of which have sensitiveness, but unable to defend themselves from heat and cold.  
uḍḍītumabhivāñchanti pakṣābhyāṃ kṣutparāyaṇāḥ / bhayāhāraparā nityaṃ bālā vihagadharmiṇaḥ // 	Boys are of the nature of birds, being both subject to fear and hunger, and ready to fly about when impelled by them.  
śaiśave guruto bhītirmātṛtaḥ pitṛtastathā / janato jyeṣṭhabālācca śaiśavaṃ bhayamandiram // 	Again boyhood is the abode of fear from all sides; such as from the tutor, father, mother, elder brother and elderly boys, and from every body besides.  
sakaladoṣadaśāvihatāśayaṃ śaraṇamapyavivekavilāsinaḥ / iha na kasyacideva mahāmune bhavati bālyamalaṃ parituṣṭaye // 	Hence the hopeless state of childhood, which is full of faults and errors, and addicted to sports and thoughtlessness, cannot be satisfactory to any body.  
śrīrāma uvāca / bālyānarthamatha tyaktvā pumānabhihatāśayaḥ / ārohati nipātāya yauvanaṃ saṃbhrameṇa tu // 	Rama continued:—The boy having passed his state of blemishes, gladly steps to his youth with hopes of gaining his objects that tend only to his ruin.  
tatrānantavilāsasya lolasya svasya cetasaḥ / vṛttīranubhavanyāti duḥkhādduḥkhāntaraṃ jaḍaḥ // 	The insensible youth feels at this time the wanton inclinations of his loose mind, and goes on falling from one tribulation to another.  
svacittabilasaṃsthena nānāsaṃbhramakāriṇā / balātkāmapiśācena vivaśaḥ paribhūyate // 	He is overcome as one subdued by the power of delusive cupid, lying hidden in the cavity of the heart.  
cintānāṃ lolavṛttīnāṃ lalanānāmivā'vṛtīḥ / arpayatyavaśaṃ ceto bālānāmañjanaṃ yathā // 	His ungoverned mind gives rise to loose thoughts like those of voluptuous women, and these serve to beguile him like the magic collyrium (in the hand) of boys.  
te te doṣā durārambhāstatra taṃ tādṛśāśayam / tadrūpaṃ pratilumpanti duṣṭāstenaiva ye mune // 	Vices of the most heinous kind betake persons of such (perverse) minds in their youth, and lead them to their ruin.  
mahānarakabījena saṃtatabhramadāyinā / yauvanena na ye naṣṭā naṣṭā nānyena te janāḥ // 	The paths of youth lead them to the gate of hell through a maze of errors. Those that have been left uncorrupt by their youth, are not to be corrupted by anything else.  
nānārasamayī citravṛttāntanicayombhitā / bhīmā yauvanabhūryena tīrṇā dhīraḥ sa ucyate // 	Whoso has passed the dreadfully enchanted coast of youth, fraught with various flavours and wonders, are said to be truly wise.  
nimeṣabhāsurākāramālolaghanagarjitam / vidyutprakāśamaśivaṃ yauvanaṃ me na rocate // 	I take no delight in our unwelcome youth, which appears to us in the form of a momentary flash of lightning, and soon succeeded by the loud roaring of the clouds.  
madhuraṃ svādu tiktaṃ ca dūṣaṇaṃ doṣabhūṣaṇam / surākallolasadṛśaṃ yauvanaṃ me na rocate // 	Youth like rich wine is sweet and delicious (at first), but becomes bitter, insipid and noxious in a short time. Hence it is not delectable to me.  
asatyaṃ satyasaṃkāśamacirādvipralambhadam / svapnāṅganāsaṅgasamaṃ yauvanaṃ me na rocate // 	Youth appearing (at first) as a reality, is found to be a false, transient thing, as deceptive as a fairy dream by night. Hence I like it not.  
sarvasyāgre sarvapuṃsaḥ kṣaṇamātramanoharam / gandharvanagaraprakhyaṃ yauvanaṃ me na rocate // 	It is the most charming of all things to men, but its charm is soon lost and fled. Therefore the phantasmagoria of youth is not pleasing to me.  
iṣuprapātamātraṃ hi sukhadaṃ duḥkhabhāsuram / dāhapoṣapradaṃ nityaṃ yauvanaṃ me na rocate // 	Youth as an arrow shot is pleasant to see, but painful to feel its smart. Hence I do not like youth that produces blood heat.  
āpātamātraramaṇaṃ sadbhāvarahitāntaram / veśyāstrīsaṃgamaprakhyaṃ yauvanaṃ me na rocate // 	Youth as a harlot is charming at first sight, but turning heartless soon after. Hence it is not to my liking.  
ye kecana samārambhāste sarve sarvaduḥkhadāḥ / tāruṇye saṃnidhiṃ yānti mahotpātā iva kṣaye // 	As the efforts of a dying man are all for his torment, so the exertions of the young are portentous of his destruction.  
hārdāndhakārakāriṇyā bhairavākāravānapi / yauvanājñānayāminyā bibheti bhagavānapi // 	Puberty advances as a dark night spreading the shadow of destruction. It darkens the heart and mind by its hedious appearance, and intimidates even the god.  
suvismṛtaśubhācāraṃ buddhivaidhuryadāyinam / dadātyatitarāmeṣa bhramaṃ yauvanasaṃbhramaḥ // 	Errors growing in youth, cause copious mistakes in life, by upsetting good sense and setting at naught the approved good manners.  
kāntāviyogajātena hṛdi duḥsparśavahninā / yauvane dahyate jantustarurdāvāgninā yathā // 	The raging fire in the hearts of the young, caused by separation of their mates, burns them down like trees by a wild fire.  
sunirmalāpi vistīrṇā pāvanyapi hi yauvane / matiḥ kaluṣatāmeti prāvṛṣīva taraṅgiṇī // 	As a clear, sacred and wide stream, becomes muddy in the rains, so doth the mind of man however clear, pure and expanded it may be, gets polluted in his youth.  
śakyate ghanakallolā bhīmā laṅghayituṃ nadī / na tu tāruṇyataralā tṛṣṇātaralitāntarā // 	It is possible for one to cross over a river made terrible by its waves, but no way possible to him to get over the boisterous expanse of his youthful desires.  
sā kāntā tau stanau pīnau te vilāsāstadānanam / tāruṇya iti cintābhiryāti jarjaratāṃ janaḥ // 	O how (lamentably) is one's youth worn out with the thoughts of his mistress, her swollen breasts, her beautiful face and her sweet caresses.  
naraṃ taralatṛṣṇārti yuvānamiha sādhavaḥ / pūjayanti na tu cchinnaṃ jarattṛṇalavaṃ yathā // 	The young man afflicted with the pain of soft desire, is regarded by the wise in no better light than a fragment of (useless) straw.  
nāśāyaiva madārtasya doṣamauktikadhāriṇaḥ / abhimānamahebhasya nityālānaṃ hi yauvanam // 	Youth is the stake of haughty self-esteem, as the rack is for the immolation of the elephant giddy with its frontal pearl.  
manovipulamūlānāṃ doṣāśīviṣadhāriṇām / śoṣarodanavṛkṣāṇāṃ yauvanaṃ bata kānanam // 	Youth is a lamentable forest, where the mind as the root of all, gives growth to jungles of (love sick) groans and sighs, and tears of sorrow. The vices of this time, are as venomous snakes of the forest.  
rasakesarasaṃbādhaṃ kuvikalpadalākulam / duścintācañcarīkāṇāṃ puṣkaraṃ viddhi yauvanam // 	Know youthful bloom of the person to resemble the blooming lotus of the lake said:—the one is full of affections, bad desires and evil intents, as the other is fraught with bees, filaments, petals and leaves.  
kṛtākṛtakupakṣāṇāṃ hṛtsarastīracāriṇām / ādhivyādhivihaṃgānāmālayo navayauvanam // 	The new bloom of youth is the resort of anxiety and disease, which like two birds with their (black and white) plumage of vice and virtue, frequent the fountain of the young man's heart.  
jaḍānāṃ gatasaṃkhyānāṃ kallolānāṃ vilāsinām / anapekṣitamaryādo vāridhirnavayauvanam // 	Early youth resembles a deep sea, disturbed by the waves of numberless amusements, transgressing all bounds, and regardless of death and disease.  
sarveṣāṃ guṇasargāṇāṃ parirūḍharajastamāḥ / apanetuṃ sthitiṃ dakṣo viṣamo yauvanānilaḥ // 	Youth is like a furious gust of wind, over-loaded with the dust of pride and vanity, and sweeps away every trace of the good qualities.  
nayanti pāṇḍutāṃ vakramākulāvakarotkaṭāḥ / ārohanti parāṃ koṭiṃ rūkṣā yauvanapāṃsavaḥ // 	The rude dust of the passions of youths, disfigures their face, and the hurricane of their sensualities cover their good qualities.  
udvodhayati doṣāliṃ nikṛntati guṇāvalim / narāṇāṃ yauvanollāso vilāso duṣkṛtaśriyām // 	Youthful vigour awakens a series of faults, and destroys a group of good qualities, by increasing the vice of pleasures.  
śarīrapaṅkajarajaścañcalāṃ matiṣaṭpadīm / nibadhnanmohayatyeṣa navayauvanacandramāḥ // 	Youthful bloom confines the fickle mind to some beauteous person, as the bright moon-beams serve to shut the flitting bee in the dust of the closing lotus.  
śarīrakhaṇḍakodbhūtā ramyā yauvanavallarī / lagnameva manobhṛṅgaṃ madayatyunnatiṃ gatā // 	Youth like a delightsome cluster of flowers, growing in the arbour of human body, attracts the mind as the bee to it, and makes it giddy.  
śarīramarutāpotthāṃ yuvatāmṛgatṛṣṇikām / manomṛgāḥ pradhāvantaḥ patanti viṣayāvaṭe // 	The human mind anxious to derive pleasure from the youthfulness of the body, falls into the cave of sensuality, as a deer running after the mirage of desert heat, falls down into a pit.  
śarīraśarvarījyotsnā cittakesariṇaḥ saṭā / laharī jīvitāmbhodheryuvatā me na tuṣṭaye // 	I take no delight in moony youth, which guilds the dark body with its beams, and resembles the stern mane of the leonine mind. It is a surge in the ocean of our lives.  
dināni katicidyeyaṃ phalitā dehajaṅgale / yuvatā śaradasyāṃ hi na samāśvāsamarhatha // 	There is no reliance in youth, which fades away as soon as summer flowers in this desert of the body.  
jhaṭityeva prayātyeva śarīrādyuvatākhagaḥ / kṣaṇenaivālpabhāgyasya hastāccintāmaṇiryathā // 	Youth is as a bird, and as soon flies away from our bodily cage as the philosopher's stone, which quickly disappears from the hands of the unfortunate.  
yadā yadā parāṃ koṭimadhyārohati yauvanam / valganti sajvarāḥ kāmāstadā nāśāya kevalam // 	As youth advances to its highest pitch, so the feverish passions wax stronger for our destruction only.  
tāvadeva vivalganti rāgadveṣapiśācakāḥ / nāstameti samastaiṣā yāvadyauvanayāminī // 	As long as the night (delusion) of youth does not come to its end, so long the fiends of our passion do not cease to rage in the desert of the body.  
nānāvikārabahule varāke kṣaṇanāśini / kāruṇyaṃ kuru tāruṇye mriyamāṇe sutai yathā // 	Pity me, O sage! in this state of youth, which is so full of perturbations, as to have deprived me of the sight (light) of reason. O pity me as thou wouldst for thy dying son.  
harṣamāyāti yo mohātpuruṣaḥ kṣaṇabhaṅginā / yauvanena mahāmugdhaḥ sa vai naramṛgaḥ smṛtaḥ // 	The foolish man who ignorantly rejoices at his transient youth, is considered as a human beast.  
mānamohānmadonmattaṃ yauvanaṃ yo'bhilaṣyati / acireṇa sa durbuddhiḥ paścāttāpena yujyate // 	The foolish fellow who is fond of his youth which is flushed with pride and fraught with errors, comes to repent (of his folly) in a short time.  
te pūjyāste mahātmānasta eva puruṣā bhuvi / ye sukhena samuttīrṇāḥ sādho yauvanasaṃkaṭāt // 	Those great minded men are honoured on earth, who have safely passed over the perils of youth.  
sukhena tīryate'mbhodhirutkṛṣṭamakarākaraḥ / na kallolabalollāsi sadoṣaṃ hatayauvanam // 	One crosses over with ease the wide ocean which is the horrible habitation of huge whales; but it is hard to pass over our youth, that is so full of vices and the billows.  
vinayabhūṣitamāryajanāspadaṃ karuṇayojjvalamāvalitaṃ guṇaiḥ / iha hi durlabhamaṅga suyauvanaṃ jagati kānanamambaragaṃ yathā // 	It is very rare to have that happy youth which is fraught with humility, and spent in the company of respectable men; which is distinguished by feelings of sympathy, and is joined with good qualities and virtues.  
śrīrāma uvāca / māṃsapāñcālikāyāstu yantralole'ṅgapañjare / snāyvasthigranthiśālinyāḥ striyāḥ kimiva śobhanaṃ // 	Rama added:—What beauty is there in the person of a woman, composed of nerves, bones and joints? She is a mere statue of flesh, and a frame of moving machinery with her ribs and limbs.  
tvaṅmāṃsaraktabāṣpāmbu pṛthakkṛtvā vilocanam / samālokaya ramyaṃ cetkiṃ mudhā parimuhyasi // 	Can you find any thing beautiful in the female form, separated from its (component parts of the) flesh, skin, blood and water, that is worth beholding? Why then dote upon it?  
itaḥ keśā ito raktamitīyaṃ pramadātanuḥ / kimetayā ninditayā karoti vipulāśayaḥ // 	This fairy frame consisting of hairs in one part and blood in the other, cannot engage the attention of a high-minded man to its blemishes.  
vāsovilepanairyāni lālitāni punaḥ punaḥ / tānyaṅgānyaṅga luṇṭhanti kravyādāḥ sarvadehinām // 	The bodies of females, that are so covered with clothing and repeatedly besmeared with paints and perfumes, are (at last) devoured by carnivorous.  
meruśrṛṃgataṭollāsigaṃgājalarayopamā / dṛṣṭā yasminstane muktāhārasyollāsaśālitā // 	The breasts of women decorated with strings of pearl, appear as charming as the pinnacles of Sumeru, washed by the waters of Ganges falling upon them.  
śmaśāneṣu diganteṣu sa eva lalanāstanaḥ / śvabhirāsvādyate kāle laghupiṇḍa ivāndhasaḥ // 	The breasts of women decorated with strings of pearl, appear as charming as the pinnacles of Sumeru, washed by the waters of Ganges falling upon them.  
raktamāṃsāsthidigdhāni karabhasya yathā vane / tathaivāṅgāni kāminyāstāṃ pratyapi hi ko grahaḥ // 	There is no difference between a woman and a young elephant that lives in the jungle, both of them being made of blood, flesh and bones. Then why hunt after her.  
āpātaramaṇīyatvaṃ kalpate kevalaṃ striyāḥ / manye tadapi nāstyatra mune mohaikakāraṇam // 	A woman is charming only for a short time, and does not long last to be so. I look upon her merely as a cause of delusion.  
vipulollāsadāyinyā madamanmathapūrvakam / ko viśeṣo vikāriṇyā madirāyāḥ striyāstathā // 	There is no difference between wine and a woman, both of them tending equally to produce high-flown mirth and jollity, and creating revelry and lust.

yadā yadā pākamupaiti nūnaṃ tadā tadeyaṃ ratimātanoti / jarābharā'nalpanavaprasūnā vijarjarā kāyalatā narāṇām // 	As the body gets towards its decline, so much doth death rejoice in it. The body grows lean with grey hairs upon the head, just as a creeper fades away with the flowers upon it.  
tṛṣṇānadī sāratarapravāhagrastākhilānantapadārthajātā / taṭasthasaṃtoṣasuvṛkṣamūlanikāṣadakṣā vahatīha loke // 	All living creatures are borne away by the stream of avarice, which upsets the tree of contentment growing on the bank and flows on for ever in this world.

It is tossed about by sensual pleasures, and goes down under the water by the pressure of its whale-like passions.  
tṛṣṇālatākānanacāriṇo'mī śākhāśataṃ kāmamahīruheṣu / paribhramantaḥ kṣapayanti kālaṃ manomṛgā no phalamāpnuvanti // 	The world is a wilderness abounding in creepers of avarice and trees of sensuality, with hundreds of desires as their branches. Our minds like monkeys pass their time in roving about this forest without getting the fruits.

taranti mātaṅgaghaṭātaraṅgaṃ raṇāmbudhiṃ ye mayi te na śūrāḥ / śūrāsta eveha manastaraṅgaṃ dehendriyāmbhodhimimaṃ taranti // 	Those who fight boldly in the battle fields and withstand the war-elephants, are not so very brave in my opinion, as those who withstand the surges of the mind amidst the streams of carnal appetites.  
akliṣṭaparyantaphalābhirāmā na dṛśyate kasyacideva kācit / kriyādurāśāhatacittavṛttiryāmetya viśrāntimupaiti lokaḥ // 	I see no such deeds in the world which endure to the last (or final emancipation) of men. Actions proceeding from a desire of fruition in fools, serve only for their restlessness on earth.  
kīrtyā jagaddikkuharaṃ pratāpaiḥ śriyā gṛhaṃ sattvabalena lakṣmīm / ye pūrayantyakṣatadhairyabandhā na te jagatyāṃ sulabhā mahāntaḥ // 	Such men are rare in the world, that have filled the corners of the world with their fame and valour, who have filled their houses with true riches acquired by honest means and an unwavering patience.  
apyantarasthaṃ giriśailabhittervajrālayābhyantarasaṃsthitaṃ vā / sarvaṃ samāyānti sasiddhivegāḥ sarvāḥ śriyaḥ santatamāpadaśca // 	Good and bad fortune always overtake a man, even if he were living in an aperture of the rock or within the walls of mountains, or even if he were enclosed within an iron built closet.  
putrāśca dārāśca dhanaṃ ca buddhyā prakalpyate tāta rasāyanābham / sarvaṃ tu tannopakarotyathānte yatrātiramyā viṣamūrcchanaiva // 	Our sons and riches are mere objects of delight to us. It is as erroneous to suppose them to be of any good to us at the end, as to expect any benefit from the decoction of poison.  
viṣādayukto viṣamāmavasthā mupāgataḥ kāyavayovasāne / bhāvānsmaransvāniha dharmariktān janturjarāvāniha dahyate'ntaḥ // 	Old people being reduced to calamitous circumstances at the pitiable state of the decay of their bodies and decline of life, have greatly to be tormented at the thoughts of the impious deeds.  
kāmārthadharmāptikṛtāntarābhiḥ kriyābhirādau divasāni nītvā / cetaścaladbarhiṇapicchalolaṃ viśrāntimāgacchatu kena puṃsaḥ // 	Men having passed their early days in the gratification of their desires and other worldly pursuits at the expense of the acts of virtue and piety, are as much troubled with anxieties at the end, that their minds are seized with a tremor like that of the plumage of a peacock shaken by the breeze. How then can a man attain to tranquility at any time?

imānyamūnīhi vibhāvitāni kāryāṇyaparyantamanoramāṇi / janasya jāyājanarañjanena javājjarāntaṃ jarayanti cetaḥ // 	That such and such desirable acts are to be done, are the constant thoughts of men, who desire to please their sons and wives, until they are worn out with age and become crazy in their minds.  
parṇāni jīrṇāni yathā tarūṇāṃ sametya janmāśu layaṃ prayānti / tathaiva lokāḥ svavivekahīnāḥ sametya gacchanti kuto'pyahobhiḥ // 	Like leaves on trees that grow to fall, and falling make room for others to shoot forth, are those men who devoid of reason, die away daily to be born again.  
itastato dūrataraṃ vihṛtya praviśya gehaṃ divasāvasāne / vivekilokāśrayasādhukarma rikte'hni rātrau ka upaiti nidrām // 	Men having travelled here and there and far and near, return to their homes at the end of the day; but none of them can have rest by day or night, except the virtuous few that live by honest dealings.  
vidrāvite śatrujane samaste samāgatāyāmabhitaśca lakṣmyām / sevyanta etāni sukhāni yāvattāvatsamāyāti kuto'pi mṛtyuḥ // 	After quelling his enemies and getting enough of riches in his clutches, the rich man just sits down to enjoy his gains; when death comes upon him, and interrupts his joy.  
kuto'pi saṃvardhitatuccharūpairbhāvairamībhiḥ kṣaṇanaṣṭadṛṣṭaiḥ / viloḍyamānā janatā jagatyāṃ navetyupāyātamaho na pātam // 	Seeing the vile trash of worldly gains earned and accumulated by the basest means to be but transitory, the infatuated mob do not perceive their approaching dissolution.  
priyāsubhiḥ kālamukhaṃ kriyante janaiḍakāste hatakarmabaddhāḥ / yaiḥ pīnatāmeva balādupetya śarīrabādhena na te bhavanti // 	Men loving their own lives, and making mouths at the demise of others, are like a herd of sheep bound to the stake, and staring at the slaughter of their fellows, yet feeding themselves to fall as fattened victims to death.  
ajasramāgacchati satvaraivamanārataṃ gacchati satvaraiva / kuto'pi lolā janatā jagatyāṃ taraṅgamālā kṣaṇabhaṅgureva // 	The multitude of people on earth, is ever seen to appear in and disappear from it as fast as the passing waves of the sea, but who can tell whence they come and whither they return.  
prāṇāpahāraikaparā narāṇāṃ mano manohāritayā haranti / raktacchadāścañcalaṣaṭpadākṣyo viṣadrumālolalatāḥ striyaśca // 	Women are as delicate as poisonous creepers, that with their red petaled lips and garments, and their eyes as busy as fluttering bees, are killers of mankind and stealers of their ravished hearts.  
ito'nyataścopagatā mudhaiva samānasaṃketanibaddhabhāvā / yātrāsamāsaṃgasamā narāṇāṃ kalatramitravyavahāramāyā // 	Men are as passengers in a procession, repairing from this side and that to join at the place of their meeting. Such is the delusive union of our wives and friends here.  
pradīpaśāntiṣviva bhuktabhūridaśāsvatisnehanibandhanīṣu / saṃsāramālāsu calācalāsu na jñāyate tattvamatāttvikīṣu // 	As the burning and extinguishing of the lamp depend on the wick and its moistening oil; so does our course in this transitory world (depend on our acts and affections only). Nobody knows the true cause of this mysterious existence.  
saṃsārasaṃrambhakucakrikeyaṃ prāvṛṭpayobudbudabhaṅgurapi / asāvadhānasya janasya buddhau cirasthirapratyayamātanoti // 	The revolution of the world is comparable with that of the potter's wheel and the floating bubbles of rain water; that appear to be lasting to the ignorant observer only.

The youthful hopes also of men fly at a distance like the bloom of lotus buds in winter.  
punaḥpunardaivavaśādupetya svadehabhāreṇa kṛtopakāraḥ / vilūyate yatra taruḥ kuṭhārairāśvāsane tatra hi kaḥ prasaṅgaḥ // 	The tree which is ordained to be useful to mankind by the loads of fruits and flowers that it bears upon its body, is fated also to be hewn down by the cruel axe at last. How then can beneficent men expect to avoid the cruel hand of death.  
manoramasyāpyatidoṣavṛtterantarviṃghātāya samutthitasya / viṣadrumasyeva janasya saṅgādāsādyate saṃprati mūrcchanaiva // 	Society with relatives is (of all others) as perilous as that of a poisonous plant; it is pleasant for its domestic affections, which are in reality but delusions of the soul.  
kāstā dṛśo yāsu na santi doṣāḥ kāstā diśo yāsu na duḥkhadāhaḥ / kāstāḥ prajā yāsu na bhaṅguratvaṃ kāstāḥ kriyā yāsu na nāma māyā // 	What is that thing in the world, which has no fault in it; and what is that which does not afflict or grieve us; what being is born that is not subjected to death, and what are those acts that are free from deceit?  
kalpābhidhānakṣaṇajīvino hi kalpaughasaṃkhyākalane viriñcayāḥ / ataḥ kalāśālini kālajāle laghutvadīrghatvadhiyo'pyasatyāḥ // 	Those living a Kalpa age are reckoned as short-lived, compared with those living for many Kalpas, and they again are so in respect to Brahma. Hence the parts of time being all finite, the ideas of their length or shortness are altogether false.  
sarvatra pāṣāṇamayā mahīdhrā mṛdā mahī dārubhireva vṛkṣāḥ / māṃsairjanāḥ pauruṣabaddhabhāvā nāpūrvamastīha vikārahīnam // 	Things that are called mountains are made of rocks, those that are called trees are made of wood, and those that are made of flesh are called animals, and man is the best of them.

camatkṛtiśceha manasvilokacetaścamatkārakarī narāṇām / svapne'pi sādho viṣayaṃ kadācitkeṣāṃcidabhyeti na citrarūpā // 	It is no wonder that this (unreal world) should appear a miraculous (reality) to the wise, and seem marvelously striking in the minds of mankind; since the visions in our dreams also appear so very fascinating to every one in their state of dreaming.  
adyāpi yāte'pi ca kalpanāyā ākāśavallīphalavanmahattve / udeti no lobhalavāhatānāmudāravṛttāntamayī kathaiva // 	Those that are corrupted in their greediness (after worldly enjoyments), will not even in their old age, receive the sermons on their eternal concerns, which they think to be false chimeras as those of a flower or a creeper growing in the sky.  
ādātumicchanpadamuttamānāṃ svacetasaivāpahato'dya lokaḥ / patatyaśaṅkaṃ paśuradrikūṭādānīlavallīphalavāñchayaiva // 	People are still deluded in their minds in wishing to attain the state of their superiors; but they fall down still lower like beasts (goats) from the top of a hill, in wishing to lay hold on the fruits of a verdant creeper out of their reach.  
avāntaranyastanirarthakāṃśacchāyālatāpatraphalaprasūnāḥ / śarīra eva kṣatasaṃpadaśca śvabhradrumā adyatanā narāśca // 	Young men spending their wealth in personal gratifications, are as useless as plants growing in the bowels of a deep and inaccessible cavern, which spread their fruits and flowers, leaves and branches and their shades to the use of nobody.  
kvacijjanā mārdavasundareṣu kvacitkaṭhoreṣu ca saṃcaranti / deśāntarāleṣu nirantareṣu vanāntakhaṇḍeṣviva kṛṣṇasārāḥ // 	Men are found to resemble the black antelopes (in their wanderings):some of them roving about the sweet, soft and beautiful sceneries of the country, and others roaming in sterile tracts and parts of boundless forests.  
dhāturnavāni divasaṃ prati bhīṣaṇāni ramyāṇi vā vilulitāntatamākulāni / kāryāṇi kaṣṭaphalapākahatodayāni vismāpayanti na śavasya manāṃsi keṣām // 	The daily and diversified acts of nature are all pernicious in their nature; they appear pleasant and ravishing to the heart for a time, but are attended with pain in the end, and fill the mind of the wise with dismay.  
janaḥ kāmāsakto vividhakukalāceṣṭanaparaḥ sa tu svapne'pyasmiñjagati sulabho nādya sujanaḥ / kriyā duḥkhāsaṅgā'vidhuravidhurā nūnamakhilā na jāne netavyā kathamiva daśā jīvitamayī // 	Man is addicted to greediness, and is prone to a variety of wicked shifts and plots; a good man is not now to be seen even in a dream, and there is no act which is free from difficulty. I know not how to pass this state of human life.  
śrīrāma uvāca / yaccedaṃ dṛśyate kiṃcijjagatsthāvarajaṃgamam / tatsarvamasthiraṃ brahmansvapnasaṃgamasaṃnibham // 	Rama said:—Whatever we see of all moveable or immovable things in this world, they are all as evanescent as things viewed in a dream.  
śuṣkasāgarasaṃkāśo nikhāto yo'dya dṛśyate / sa prātarabhrasaṃvīto nagaḥ saṃpadyate mune // 	The hollow desert that appears as the dried bed of a sea to-day, will be found to-morrow to be a running flood by the accumulation of rain-water in it.  
yo vanavyūhavistīrṇo vilīḍhagagano mahān / dinaireva sa yātyurvīsamatāṃ kūpatāṃ ca vā // 	What is to-day a mountain reaching the sky and with extensive forests on it, is in course of time levelled to the ground, and is afterwards dug into pit.  
yadaṅgamadya saṃvītaṃ kauśeyasragvilepanaiḥ / digambaraṃ tadeva śvo dūre viśaritā'vaṭe // 	The body that is clothed to-day with garments of silk, and decorated with garlands and fragrance, is to be cast away naked into a ditch to-morrow.  
yatrādya nagaraṃ dṛṣṭaṃ vicitrācāracañcalam / tatraivodeti divasaiḥ saṃśūnyāraṇyadharmatā // 	What is seen to be a city to-day, and busy with the bustle of various occupations, passes in course of a few days into the condition of an uninhabited wilderness.  
yaḥ pumānadya tejasvī maṇḍalānyadhitiṣṭhati / sa bhasmakūṭatāṃ rājandivasairadhigacchati // 	The man who is very powerful to-day and presides over principalities, is reduced in a few days to a heap of ashes.  
araṇyānī mahābhīmā yā nabhomaṇḍalopamā / patākācchāditākāśā saiva saṃpadyate purī // 	The very forest which is so formidable to-day and appears as blue as the azure skies, turns to be a city in the course of time, with its banners hoisted in the air.  
yā latāvalitā bhīmā bhātyadya vipināvalī / divasaireva sā yāti punarmarumahīpadam // 	What is (to-day) a formidable jungle of thick forests, turns in time to be a table-land as on the mount Meru.  
salilaṃ sthalatāṃ yāti sthalībhavati vāribhūḥ / viparyasyati sarvaṃ hi sakāṣṭhāmbutṛṇaṃ jagat // 	Water becomes land and land becomes water. Thus the world composed of wood, grass and water becomes otherwise with all its contents in course of time.  
anityaṃ yauvanaṃ bālyaṃ śarīraṃ dravyasaṃcayāḥ / bhāvādbhāvāntaraṃ yānti taraṅgavadanāratam // 	Our boyhood and youth, bodies and possessions are all but transient things, and they change from one state to another, as the ever fluctuating waves of the ocean.  
vātāntardīpakaśikhālolaṃ jagati jīvitam / taḍitsphuraṇasaṃkāśā padārthaśrīrjagatrtraye // 	Our lives in this (mortal) world, are as unsteady as the flame of a lamp placed at the window, and the splendour of all the objects in the three worlds, is as flickering as the flashing of the lightning.  
viparyāsamiyaṃ yāti bhūribhūtaparamparā / bījarāśirivājasraṃ pūryamāṇaḥ punaḥpunaḥ // 	As a granary stored with heaps of grains is exhausted by its continued waste, so is the stock of life spent away by its repeated respirations.  
manaḥpavanaparyastabhūribhūtarajaḥpaṭā / pātotpātaparāvartaparābhinayabhūṣitā // 	The mind of man is as fluctuating as a flag waving in the air and filled with the dust of sin, to indicate its wavering between the paths of heaven and hell.  
ālakṣyate sthitiriyaṃ jāgatī janitabhramā / nṛttāveśavivṛtteva saṃsārārabhaṭīnaṭī // 	The existence of this delusive world, is as the appearance of an actress on the stage, shuffling her vests as she trudges along in her dancing.  
gandharvanagarākāraviparyāsavidhāyinī / apāṅgabhaṅgurodāravyavahāramanoramā // 	It's scenes are as changeful and fascinating as those of a magic city; and its dealings as bewitching and momentary as the glances of a giggling girl.  
taḍittaralamālokamātanvānā punaḥpunaḥ / saṃsāraracanā rājannṛttasakteva rājate // 	The stage of the world presents us a scene of continued dancing (of the sorceress of deception), and the deceptive glances of her eyes resembling the fleeting flashes of lightning.  
divasāste mahāntaste saṃpadastāḥ kriyāśca tāḥ / sarvaṃ smṛtipathaṃ yātaṃ yāmo vayamapi kṣaṇāt // 	The days, the great men, their hey-days and deeds (that are past and gone), are now retained in our memory only, and such must be our cases also in a short time.  
pratyahaṃ kṣayamāyāti pratyahaṃ jāyate punaḥ / adyāpi hatarūpāyā nānto'syā dagdhasaṃsṛteḥ // 	Many things are going to decay and many coming anew day by day; and there is yet no end of this accursed course of events in this ever-changeful world.  
tiryaktvaṃ puruṣā yānti tiryañco naratāmapi / devāścādevatāṃ yānti kimiveha vibho sthiram // 	Men degenerate into lower animals, and those again rise to humanity (by metempsychosis), gods become no-gods, and there is nothing that remains the same.  
racayanraśmijālena rātryahāni punaḥpunaḥ / ativāhya raviḥ kālo vināśāvadhimīkṣate // 	The sun displays every thing to light by his rays, and watches over the rotations of days and nights, to witness like time the dissolution of all things.  
brahmā viṣṇuśca rudraśca sarvā vā bhūtajātayaḥ / nāśamevānudhāvanti salilānīva vāḍavam // 	The gods Brahma, Vishnu and Siva and all material productions, are reduced to nothingness, like the submarine fire subsiding under the waters of the deep.  
dyauḥ kṣamā vāyurākāśaṃ parvatāḥ sarito diśaḥ / vināśavāḍavasyaitatsarvaṃ saṃśuṣkamindhanam // 	The heaven, the earth, the air, the sky, the mountains, the rivers, and all the quarters of the globe, are subject to destruction like the dry fuel by the all-destroying fire of the last day.  
dhanāni bāndhavā bhṛtyā mitrāṇi vibhavāśca ye / vināśabhayabhītasya sarvaṃ nīrasatāṃ gatam // 	Riches and relatives, friends, servants and affluence, are of no pleasure to him who is in constant dread of death.  
svadante tāvadevaite bhāvā jagati dhīmate / yāvatsmṛtipathaṃ yāti na vināśakurākṣasaḥ // 	All these are so long delightful to a sensible man, as the monster of death does not appear before the eye of his mind.  
kṣaṇamaiśvaryamāyāti kṣaṇameti daridratām / kṣaṇaṃ vigatarogatvaṃ kṣaṇamāgatarogatām // 	We have prosperity at one moment, succeeded by adversity at another; so we have health at one time, followed by sickness soon after.  
pratikṣaṇaviparyāsadāyinā nihatātmanā / jagadbhrameṇa ke nāma dhīmanto hi na mohitāḥ // 	What intelligent being is there, that is not misled by these delusions of the world, which represent things otherwise than what they are, and serve to bewilder the mind?  
tamaḥpaṅkasamālabdhaṃ kṣaṇamākāśamaṇḍalam / kṣaṇa kanakaniṣyandakomalālokasundaram // 	(The world is as varying) as the face of the skies; it is now as black as dark clay, and in the next moment bright with the golden hues of fair light.  
kṣaṇaṃ jaladanīlābjamālāvalitakoṭaram / kṣraṇamuḍḍāmararavaṃ kṣaṇaṃ mūkamiva sthitam // 	It is now over-cast by azure clouds resembling the blue lotuses of the lake, and roaring loudly for a time and then being dumb and silent on a sudden:  
kṣaṇaṃ tārāviracitaṃ kṣaṇamarkeṇa bhūṣitam / kṣaṇamindukṛtāhlādaṃ kṣaṇaṃ sarvabahiṣkṛtam // 	Now studded with stars, and now glowing with the glory of the sun;then graced by the pleasant moonbeams, and at last without any light at all.  
āgamāpāyaparayā kṣaṇasaṃsthitināśayā / na bibheti hi saṃsāre dhīro'pi ka ivānayā // 	Who is there so sedate and firm, that is not terrified at these sudden appearances and their disappearance, and the momentary durations and final dissolution of worldly things?  
āpadaḥ kṣaṇamāyānti kṣaṇamāyānti saṃpadaḥ / kṣaṇaṃ janma kṣaṇaṃ mṛtyurmune kimiva na kṣaṇam // 	What is the nature of this world, where we are overtaken by adversity at one moment, and elated by prosperity at another, where one is born at a time, and dies away at another?  
prāgāsīdanya eveha jātastvanyo naro dinaiḥ / sadaikarūpaṃ bhagavankiṃcidasti na susthiram // 	One that was something else before, is born as a man in this life, and is changed to another state in course of a few days; thus there is no being that remains steadily in the same state.  
ghaṭasya paṭatā dṛṣṭā paṭasyāpi ghaṭasthitiḥ / na tadasti na yaddṛṣṭaṃ viparyasyati saṃsṛtau // 	A pot is made of clay, and cloth is made of cotton, and they are still the same dull materials of which they are composed: thus there is nothing new in this world that was not seen or known before, and that changes not its form.  
tanotyutpādayatyatti nihatyāsṛjati kramāt / satataṃ rātryahānīva nivartante naraṃ prati // 	The acts of creation and destruction, of diffusion, production, and sustentation follow one another, as the revolution of day and night to man.  
aśūreṇa hataḥ śūra ekenāpi hataṃ śatam / prākṛtāḥ prabhutāṃ yātāḥ sarvamāvartyate jagat // 	It happens sometimes, that an impotent man slays a hero, and that hundreds are killed by one individual; so also a commoner becomes a noble man, and thus every thing is changeful in this varying world.  
janateyaṃ viparyāsamajasramanugacchati / jaḍaspandaparāmarśāttaraṅgāṇāmivāvalī // 	These bodies of men that are always changing their states, are as bodies of waters rising and falling in waves by motion of the winds.  
bālyamalpadinaireva yauvanaśrīstato jarā / dehe'pi naikarūpatvaṃ kāsthā bāhyeṣu vastuṣu // 	Boyhood lasts but a few days, and then it is succeeded by youth which is as quickly followed by old age: thus there being no identity of the same person, how can one rely on the uniformity of external objects?  
kṣaṇamānanditāmeti kṣaṇameti viṣāditām / kṣaṇaṃ saumyatvamāyāti sarvasminnaṭavanmanaḥ // 	The mind that gets delighted in a moment and becomes dejected in the next, and assumes likewise its equanimity at another, is indeed as changeful as an actor.  
itaścānyaditaścānyaditaścānyadayaṃ vidhiḥ / racayanvastunāyāti khedaṃ līlāsvivārbhakaḥ // 	The creator who is ever turning one thing into another in his work of creation, is like a child who makes and breaks his doll without concern.  
cinotyutpādayatyatti nihatyāsṛjati kramāt / satataṃ rātryahānīva nivartante naraṃ prati // 	The actions of producing and collecting (of grains), of feeding (one's self) and destroying (others), come by turns to mankind like the rotation of day and night.  
āvirbhāvatirobhāvabhāgino bhavabhāginaḥ / janasya sthiratāṃ yānti nāpado na ca saṃpadaḥ // 	Neither adversity nor prosperity is of long continuance in the case of worldly people, but they are ever subject to appearance and disappearance by turns.  
kālaḥ krīḍatyayaṃ prāyaḥ sarvamāpadi pātayan / helāvicalitāśeṣacaturācāracañcuraḥ // 	Time is a skilful player and plays many parts with ease; but he is chiefly skilled in tragedy, and often plays his tragic part in the affairs of men.  
samaviṣamavipākato vibhinnāstribhuvanabhūtaparamparāphalaughāḥ / samayapavanapātitāḥ patanti pratidinamātatasaṃsṛtidrumebhyaḥ // 	All beings are produced as fruits in the great forest of the universe, by virtue of their good and bad acts (of past lives): and time like a gust of wind blasts them day by day before their maturity.  
śrīrāma uvāca / iti me doṣadāvāgnidagdhe mahati cetasi / prasphuranti na bhogāśā mṛgatṛṣṇāḥ saraḥsviva // 	Thus is my heart consumed by the wild-fire of those great worldly evils, and there rises in me no desire of enjoying them, as there rises no mirage from a lake.  
pratyahaṃ yāti kaṭutāmeṣā saṃsārasaṃsthitiḥ / kālapākavaśāllolā rasā nimbalatā yathā // 	My existence upon earth gets bitter day by day, and though I have got some experience in it, yet its associations have made me as sour as the Nimba plant by its immersion in water.  
vṛddhimāyāti daurjanyaṃ saujanyaṃ yāti tānavam / karañjakarkaśe rājanpratyahaṃ janacetasi // 	I see wickedness on the increase, and righteousness on the decline in the mind of man, which like the sour Karanja (crab) fruit, becomes sourer every day.  
bhajyate bhuvi maryādā jhaṭityeva dinaṃ prati / śuṣkeva māṣaśimbīkā ṭaṅkārakaravaṃ vinā // 	I see honour is eaten up every day by mutual altercations of men, using harsh words to each other as they crack the nuts under their teeth.  
rājyebhyo bhogapūgebhyaścintāvadbhyo munīśvara / nirastacintākalitā varamekāntaśīlatā // 	Too much eagerness for royalty and worldly enjoyments, is equally prejudicial to our welfare; as we loose our future prospects by the former, and our present happiness by the latter.  
nānandāya mamodyānaṃ na sukhāya mama striyaḥ / na harṣāya mamārthāśā śāmyāmi manasā saha // 	I take no delight in my gardens nor have any pleasure in women; I feel no joy at the prospect of riches, but enjoy my solace in my own heart and mind.  
anityaścāsukho lokastṛṣṇā tāta durudvahā / cāpalopahataṃ cetaḥ kathaṃ yāsyāmi nirvṛtim // 	Frail are the pleasures of the world, and avarice is altogether intolerable; the bustle of business has broken down my heart, and (I know not) where to have my tranquility.  
nābhinandāmi maraṇaṃ nābhinandāmi jīvitam / yathā tiṣṭhāmi tiṣṭhāmi tathaiva vigatajvaram // 	Neither do I hail death nor am I in love with my life; but remain as I do, devoid of all anxiety and care.  
kiṃ me rājyena kiṃ bhogaiḥ kimarthena kimīhitaiḥ / ahaṃkāravaśādetatsa eva galito mama // 	What have I to do with a kingdom and with all its enjoyments? Of what avail are riches to me, and what is the end of all our exertions? All these are but requirements of self-love, from which I am entirely free.  
janmāvalivaratrāyāmindriyagranthayo dṛḍhāḥ / ye baddhāstadvimokṣārthaṃ yatante ye ta uttamāḥ // 	The chain of (repeated) births is a bond that binds fast all men by its strong knots of the senses; those striving to break loose from this bondage for their liberation, are (said to be) the best of men.  
mathitaṃ māninīlokairmano makaraketunā / komalaṃ khuraniṣpeṣaiḥ kamalaṃ kariṇā yathā // 	These haughty damsels whom the god of love employs to ravage the hearts of men, resemble a group of elephants subverting a lotus bed under their feet.  
adya cetsvacchayā buddhyā munīndra na cikitsyate / bhūyaścittacikitsāyāstatkilāvasaraḥ kutaḥ // 	The treatment of the mind with pure reason being neglected now (in youth), it is hard to heal it afterwards (in age), when it admits of no cure.  
viṣaṃ viṣayavaiṣamyaṃ na viṣaṃ viṣamucyate / janmāntaraghnā viṣayā ekadehaharaṃ viṣam // 	It is the worldliness of man that is his true poison, while real poison is no poison to him. It is the poison of worldliness which destroys his future life, while real poison is only locally injurious to him.  
na sukhāni na duḥkhāni na mitrāṇi na bāndhavāḥ / na jīvitaṃ na maraṇaṃ bandhāya jñasya cetasaḥ // 	Neither pleasure nor pain, nor friends nor relatives, nor even life and death, can enchain (affect) the mind that has received the light of truth.  
tadbhavāmi yathā brahmanpūrvāparavidāṃ vara / vītaśokabhayāyāso jñastathopadiśāśu me // 	Teach me, Oh Brahman! that art the best of the learned in the mysteries of the past and future, teach me so that I may soon become like one devoid of grief and fear and worldly troubles, and may have the light of truth beaming upon me.  
vāsanājālavalitā duḥkhakaṇṭakasaṃkulā / nipātotpātabahulā bhīmarūpā'jñatāṭavī // 	The forest of ignorance is laid over with the snare of desire, it is full of the thorns of misery, and is the dreadful seat of destruction and the danger.  
krakacāgraviniṣpeṣaṃ soḍhuṃ śaknomyahaṃ mune / saṃsāravyavahārotthaṃ nāśāviṣayavaiśasam // 	I can rather suffer myself to be put under the jaws of death with his rows of teeth like saws, but cannot bear the dreadly pains of worldly cares and anxieties.  
idaṃ nāstīdamastīti vyavahārāñjanabhramaḥ / dhunotīdaṃ calaṃ ceto rajorāśimivānilaḥ // 	It is a gloomy error in this world to think that I have this and have not the other; it serves to toss about our minds as a gust of wind disperses the dust of the earth.  
tṛṣṇātantulavaprotaṃ jīvasaṃcayamauktikam / cidacchāṅgatayā nityaṃ vikasaccittanāyakam // 	It is the thread of avarice that links together all living beings like a chaplet of pearls; the mind serves to twirl about this chain, but pure consciousness sits quiet to observe its rotation.  
saṃsārahāramaratiḥ kālavyālavibhūṣaṇam / troṭayāmyahamakrūraṃ vāgurāmiva kesarī // 	I who am devoid of desires, would like to break this ornamental chain of worldliness, hanging about me as a deadly serpent, in the same manner, as a lion breaks asunder the net.  
nīhāraṃ hṛdayāṭavyāṃ manastimiramāśu me / kena vijñānadīpena bhindhi tattvavidāṃvara // 	Do you now, O most learned sage, scatter the mist which has overspread the forest of my heart, and the darkness which has overcast my mind, by the light of true knowledge.  
vidyanta eveha na te mahātman durādhayo na kṣayamāpnuvanti / ye saṅgamenottamamānasānāṃ niśātamāṃsīva niśākareṇa // 	There are no anxieties, O sage! which cannot be put to an end by the society of good minded men; the darkness of night can be well removed by moon-beams.  
āyurvāyuvighaṭṭitābhrapaṭalīlambāmbuvadbhaṅguraṃ bhogā meghavitānamadhyavilasatsaudāminīcañcalāḥ / lolāyauvanalālanājalarayaścetyākalayya drutaṃ mudraivādya dṛḍhārpitā nanu mayā citte ciraṃ śāntaye // 	Life is as fickle as a drop of water pending on a mass of clouds blown away by the winds. Our enjoyments are as unsteady as the lightning that flickers in the midst of clouds. The pleasures of youth are as slippery as water. With these reflections in my mind, I have subdued them all under the province of peace and tranquility.  
śrīrāma uvāca / evamabhyutthitānarthaśatasaṃkaṭakoṭare / jagadālokya nirmagnaṃ mano mananakardame // 	Seeing the world thus ingulphed amidst the abyss of hundreds of rising dangers and difficulties, my mind is immerged in the mire of anxieties.  
mano me bhramatīvedaṃ saṃbhramaścopajāyate / gātrāṇi parikampante patrāṇīva jarattaroḥ // 	My mind is wandering everywhere and I am struck with fear at every thing; my limbs are shaking with fear like the leaves of a withered tree.  
anāptottamasaṃtoṣadhairyotsaṅgākulā matiḥ / śūnyāspadā bibhetīha bālevālpabaleśvarā // 	My mind is bewildered by impatience for its want of true contentment, just as a young woman is afraid in a desert for want of the company of her strong handed husband.  
vikalpebhyo luṭhantyetāścāntaḥkaraṇavṛttayaḥ / śvabhrebhya iva sāraṅgāstucchālambaviḍambitāḥ // 	The thoughts of my mind are entangled in my desire for worldly enjoyments, as stags are caught in the pit strewn with grass over it.  
avivekāspadā bhraṣṭāḥ kaṣṭe rūḍhā na satpade / andhakūpamivāpannā varākāścakṣurādayaḥ // 	The senses of an unreasonable man, ever run astray to the wrong and never turn to the right way; so the eyes of a blind man lead him but to fall into the pit.  
nāvasthitimupāyāti na ca yāti yathepsitam / cintā jīveśvarāyattā kānteva priyasadmani // 	Human thoughts are linked to the animal soul as consorts to their lords. They can neither sit idle nor ramble at liberty, but must remain as wives under the control of their husbands.
