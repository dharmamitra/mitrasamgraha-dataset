paraspara vibhinnāḥ hi yathā buddhi sukha ādayaḥ / pṛthak vācyāḥ tad aṅgam ca vinā anyena tathā apare // 	Just as cognition, pleasure and the rest, being different from one another, are spoken of as ‘separate’, and hence become the basis of that notion (of separateness), independently of anything else,—so would other things also 
yau saṃyoga vibhāgau ca dravyeṣu niyatau paraiḥ / saṃyukta ādi dhiyaḥ hetū kalpitau tau anarthakau // 	Conjunction and disjunction as restricted to substances have been postulated by others as causes of the notions of ‘being joined’ and the like; these are entirely useless

That thing which they require is conjunction; and as it has a particular characteristic, it is regarded as distinct (from other things). when one is told to ‘bring two conjoined things’, he brings only those two things in which he perceives the conjunction, avoiding everything else.” 
nirantaram idam vastu sāntaram ca idam iti ayam / buddhi bhedaḥ ca kena eṣa vidyate tau na ced iha // 	If conjunction and disjunction were not there, then to what would such distinct notions be due as—‘this thing is attached to it’—‘this is detached from it’?”

It could not proceed from the mere presence of the man and the ear-ring; for in that case, the said notion would be there always.—Further, it is only something that has been perceived to be present in one place that is denied in another place. If conjunction has not been perceived, then how does it come to be denied in such expressions as ‘caitra is without ear-rings’? Hence it follows that there is some such real thing in the shape of conjunction, whose affirmation and denial proceed with due distinction.” 
ucyate kṣaṇika tvena na aviśeṣāḥ jala ādayaḥ / sattve api avyavadhāna ādi te apekṣante daśā antaram // 	The answer to the above is as follows:—The water and the rest do not remain the same, as all things are momentary.—Even when existent, they stand in need of that condition in which there is nothing intervening between them 
saṃyoga mātra sāpekṣāḥ yadi tu syuḥ jala ādayaḥ / yoga anantaram eva syāt kāryam etena vā bhavet // 	If the water, etc. needed the conjunction only, then they would appear immediately on their coming together (conjunction),—or not appear at all 
prāpta avasthā viśeṣe hi nairantaryeṇa jātitaḥ / ye paśyati āharati eṣa vastunī te tathāvidhe // 	When a man sees two things having come close together by themselves, he brings those things in that condition (when told to do so) 
vicchinnam anyathā ca eva jātam eti nimitta tām  / sāntara anantara jñāne geha vindhya hima adri vat // 	When a thing is produced in the detached form, it becomes the basis for the notion op being ‘detached’; on the other hand, when it is produced in the attached form, it becomes the basis of the notion of being ‘attached’;—just as in the case of the house, the vindhya mountain and the himalaya mountain 
mithyābuddhiḥ na sarvā eva pradhāna artha anusāriṇī / sādharmya nirapekṣā api kācid antar upaplavāt // anyatra gata cittasya dvi candra ādi matiḥ yathā / avicchinna ādi jātam vā pradhānam iha vidyate // 	A misconception does not appear always in accordance with a primary conception; for instance, the notion of ‘two moons’ appears independently of its similarity to any other (primary) notion, through some internal derangement, while the mind is turned elsewhere.—Or, the requisite ‘primary’ in the case in question may be that same thing which has been produced in the attached form and the like (but is misconceived as being detached or otherwise) 
kuṇḍalī iti matiḥ ca iyam jāta avasthā viśeṣayoḥ / caitra kuṇḍalayoḥ eva saṃyogaḥ iva jāyate // 	The notion of ‘the man with the ear-ring’ arises only with reference to caitra (the man) and the ear-ring, in whom a particular condition has come about; and it only appears as if the cognition were of ‘conjunction’ (between the two) 
saḥ avasthā atiśayaḥ tādṛś dṛṣṭaḥ anyatra niṣidhyate / caitre kuṇḍale ityādau na saṃyogaḥ tu adṛṣṭitaḥ // 	It is the one peculiar condition seen in one place which is denied in another place.—as regards the notion ‘caitra is without the ear-ring’, it is not conjunction that is denied; for the simple reason that this conjunction has never been seen

atha anirvacanīya tvam samūha ādeḥ niṣidhyate / yasmāt niyata dharma tvam rūpa śabda rasa ādi vat // 	If the fact of the ‘group’ and such things being undefinable is denied (by the opponent) on the ground that they have distinctive features,—just like colour, sound, taste and other things,—[then our answer is as given in the next text] 
niḥsvabhāva tayā tasya tattvataḥ ambara padma vat / na siddhāḥ niyatāḥ dharmāḥ kalpanā āropitāḥ tu te // tathā eva uktau anekāntaḥ viyat padma ādibhiḥ yatas  / abhedaḥ vyatirekaḥ ca vastuni eva vyavasthitaḥ // 	In reality, the ‘group’ is absolutely feature-less; hence, like the ‘sky-lotus’, it can have no specific properties; they are all figments of imagination.—Even when stated in this form, the reasoning adduced would be ‘fallible’, in view of things like the ‘sky-lotus in fact, ‘non-difference’ as well as ‘difference’ rests always in an object 
saṅkhyā ādeḥ dravyataḥ anya tvam evam ced pratipādyate / āśraya asiddha tā hetoḥ saṅkhyā ādīnām asiddhitaḥ // 	Thus then, if what is meant to be asserted is that number and the rest are other than (different from) substance,—then the reason becomes open to the fallacy of ‘having no substratum’,—because number and the rest are not admitted at all 
samuccaya ādi bhinnam tu dravyam eva tathā ucyate / svarūpāt eva bhedaḥ ca vyāhataḥ sādhitaḥ bhavet // 	If it is substance itself, as diversified through ‘group’, etc., that is spoken of as such,—then what the argument would prove would be the difference of substance from itself—thus involving self-contradiction

bhāvanā ākhyaḥ tu saṃskāraḥ cetasaḥ vāsanā ātmakaḥ / yuktaḥ na ātma guṇaḥ ca idam yujyate tad nirākṛteḥ // 	The momentum called ‘impression’ is of the nature of an impress on the mind. it cannot be a quality of the soul; because this has been rejected 
sthita sthāpaka rūpaḥ tu na yuktaḥ kṣaṇabhaṅgataḥ / sthita artha asambhavāt bhāve tādrūpyāt eva saṃsthitiḥ // 	There can be no such quality as ‘elasticity’, because things are in a ‘perpetual flux’, and hence nothing can be lasting (sthita); if there were any such thing, it should continue to exist in that same form 
kṣaṇam tu ekam avasthānam sva hetoḥ eva jātitaḥ / pūrva pūrva prabhāvāt ca prabandhena anuvartanam // 	The momentary existence of a thing consists merely in its being produced from its cause; and the ‘continuity in the chain’ also (of every succeeding thing) is due to being produced from each preceding thing

Further, the momentum in question has been held to be a quality that re-establishes what has been already produced,—such for example, as the cloth.—What therefore has been called a ‘quality’ and ‘momentum’ is not possible 
manaḥ yoga ātmanām pūrvam vistareṇa nibandhanāt / para ukta lakṣaṇa upetam na adṛṣṭam upapadyate // 	Mind, mind’s contact and the soul having been previously discarded,—there can be no ‘unseen force’ of the kinds postulated by the other party

kṣaṇa kṣayiṣu bhāveṣu karma utkṣepa ādi asambhavi / jāta deśe cyuteḥ eva tad anya prāpti asambhavāt // 	In things that are in a ‘perpetual flux’, any action, in the shape of ‘throwing up’ and the like, is impossible; because it ceases at the very place where it is born, and hence it cannot get at any other place 
kṣaṇa kṣayiṣu bhāveṣu karma utkṣepa ādi asambhavi / jāta deśe cyuteḥ eva tad anya prāpti asambhavāt // 	In things that are in a ‘perpetual flux’, any action, in the shape of ‘throwing up’ and the like, is impossible; because it ceases at the very place where it is born, and hence it cannot get at any other place 
janma atirikta kālam hi kriyā kālam pare jaguḥ / iṣṭa āśutara nāśeṣu dīpa ādiṣu api vastuṣu // 	The other party also have asserted that the time of action is subsequent to the time of the birth of the object,—even in such things as the lamp-flame, which are admitted (by him also) to be fleeting in their character

sthairye tu vastunaḥ sarve durghaṭāḥ gamana ādayaḥ / sutarām eva sarvāsu daśāsu asya aviśeṣataḥ // 	In case the object is something lasting, ‘going’ and the rest are all impossible; because such an object should remain the same under all conditions,

atha āgantra ādi rūpam tad prakṛtyā agamana ādayaḥ / sadā syuḥ kṣaṇam api ekam na eva praspanda vat bhavet // yasmāt gati ādi bhāve api niścala ātmakam eva tat / atyakta pūrvarūpa tvāt niścala ātmaka kāla vat // 	If, on the other hand, the objects were, by their nature, of the nature of the ‘immobile entity’,—then absence of going should be there always, and there would be no movement of any kind even for a moment. because, even when going might be there, the object would still be of the nature of the ‘immobile entity’,—because it will not have renounced its previous nature,—just as at the time when it was not moving 
yadi tu syāt agantā ayam ekadā ca anyathā punar / paraspara vibhinna ātma saṃgateḥ bhinna tā bhavet // 	If the object were mobile at one time and immobile at another then, inasmuch as two mutually different characters would be there, it would be two different objects 
atyanta bhinnau ātmānau tau iti vyavasīyate / viruddha dharma vṛtti tvāt cala niścala vastu vat // 	It is clearly seen that the two are entirely different; because of the presence of contradictory properties:—like two things of which one is moving and another not moving 
dṛśya tva abhimatam karma na vastu vyatireki ca / dṛśyate saḥ pi nā eva asya sattā yukti anupātinī // 	The action that is regarded as visible is nothing different from the object. even such existence of it as would be compatible with reason, is never actually perceived 
asthire vā sthire vā evam gati ādīnām asambhavaḥ / prāktana apara deśābhyām vibhāga prāpti ayogataḥ // 	Thus ‘going’ and the rest are impossible either in permanent or impermanent things; because it is not possible for them either to be separated from their former place, or to get at another place

The qualifying clause has been added for the purpose of excluding the ‘hare’s horns’ and such other non-entities. The name and idea of the other things are the corroborative instance per dissimilarity. (b) “The idea pervading over all cows proceeds from something different from the body of the cow,—because it appears as a differentiator,—like the idea of the ‘blue’ and the like. (c) “The ‘universal’ cow is something different from the ‘individual’ cow,—because it forms the object of a different idea;—like the idea of the colour and other qualities of the same cow,—also because it (the universal) is spoken of as belonging to that (the individual),—just as the horse is spoken of as belonging to caitra.”

ajalpa ākāram eva ādau vijñānam tu prajāyate / tatas tu samaya ābhogaḥ tasmāt smārttam tatas api te // 	At first, every cognition appears in a form free from verbal expression; then comes in the body of conventions; hence the notions in question partake of the nature of remembrance,—for that reason also 
anyatra gata cittasya vastu mātra upalambhanam / sarva upādhi vivekena tatas eva pravarttate // 	It is because the process is as described that when a man has his mind turned somewhere else, there appears only the vague apprehension of the mere thing apart from all specific peculiarities

antarmātrā samārūḍham sāṃvṛtam tu avalambya te / bahis rūpa adhyavasitam pravarttante aṅkuśa ādikam // 	In fact, all these notions proceed on the basis of things like the goad, which consist in mere ‘idea’ and are illusory, on -which ‘externality’ is imposed

Lastly, the notion of ‘non-existence’ would be applicable to ‘being’ and such ‘universals’ also

siddhe api anya nimitta tve na sāmānyam prasiddhyati / anugāmi ekam adhrauvya viviktam ca krama udayāt // 	Even though it may be taken as established that the notions in question have a different cause, the existence of the ‘universal’ as comprehensive, and free from impermanence, does not become established; because the notions in question appear in succession

tad anantaram uddiṣṭam anena eva nirākṛtam / sāmānya sādhanam tasmin iṣṭa siddhi ādayaḥ samāḥ // 	The argument in proof of the ‘universal’ that has been urged after the one just disposed of, also becomes rejected by this; because the fallacy of ‘futility’ and the rest are equally applicable to that also

kriyā tva jāti sambandha kriyā yogāt matiḥ yadi / naṣṭa kriye api ca tayā dhruva hetu upalakṣaṇāt // 	If the idea be said to be due to the presence of the act related to the ‘universal’ action,—and this permanent basis is always indicated by it even when the particular act has ceased,—[then, the answer is as given in the following text] 
na tu naṣṭa kriye tatra lakṣitā api na vidyate / gṛhyate yā dhruvā jātiḥ sva ādhāra vinivṛttitaḥ // 	When the particular act has ceased, the permanent ‘universal’, even though indicated, cannot really exist; for the simple reason that its receptacle has ceased to exist

But if so, then, how could there be that inherence, even afterwards, when the defect would still be there? 
yadi nāma adhruvā vyaktiḥ labheta atiśayam tadā / jāteḥ tu viguṇam rūpam na kadācid nivarttate // 	If the particular object be not permanent, it might acquire additional characters; but even so, the defective nature of the ‘universal’ would never cease 
pacana ādi kriyāyāḥ ca pradhānam sādhanam matam / pācaka ādi iti tat ca asti prādhānyam pācaka antare // 	The name ‘cook’ is meant to be applied to that which is the principal cause of the act of cooking; and this ‘principality’ is present in another cook also.” 
prādhānyam kim idam nāma na śaktiḥ asamanvayāt / dravya kriyā guṇa ātma ādi na atas eva avakalpyate // 	What is it that is called ‘principal character’?—It cannot be a potency; because this does not subsist (in other individuals).—For the same reason it cannot be said to consist in the nature of the substance, quality or action, etc

tathā ca abhāva vijñānam na abhāveṣu virudhyate / dhvaniḥ vā anugataḥ anartha saṅketa anugamāt tayoḥ // 	Thus the notion of negation with regard to negation is not incompatible; nor is the comprehensive name (incompatible); because they proceed from convention, which does not involve the assumption of any other entity

(b) The notion of the ‘cow’ or the’ horse’ is not held to be due to the ‘universal’ being. If it did, then only one ‘universal’ would have to be postulated as accomplishing everything (as being the basis of all notions)

bheda jñāne satī icchā hi saṅketa karaṇe tatas  / tad kṛtiḥ tad śrutiḥ ca asyāḥ ābhogaḥ tad matiḥ tatas  // anvaya vyatirekābhyām idam eva viniścitam  / samartham kāraṇam tasyām anyeṣām anavasthitiḥ // 	When there is cognition of diversity, then there arises the desire to set up a convention;—then the convention is set up;—then comes the hearing of the name in accordance with that convention;—then the ‘body’ or ‘form’ of the convention;—then the notion (in accordance with that convention). that this is the cause (basis) of the said notions is thus known definitely through affirmative and negative premisses in regard to other causes, there would be an infinite regress

anvaya anuvidhānam ca sāmānyeṣu na vidyate / sadā asattvāt na nityānām vyatirekaḥ tu saṃbhavī // 	As a matter of fact, there can be no affirmative concomitance (of the notions) with the universals: as their notion is not always present; as for negative concomitance, that is not possible in the case of what are eternal 
adravya ādi dhiyaḥ hetuḥ na guṇa tva ādi yuktimat / aneka samavāyaḥ ca na sāmānya dhiyaḥ tatas // 	The view that “the universal ‘quality’ is the basis of the notion of ‘not-substance’ and the like” is not reasonable; for the same reason there can be no ‘inherence in the same object’ in the case of the notion of the ‘universal’, 
aneka samavāyaḥ ca saṅkhyā ādiṣu api vidyate / sāmānyeṣu iva teṣu syuḥ sāmānyam iti buddhayaḥ // 	As for ‘inherence in several things’, this is present in number, etc. also, just as in the ‘universals’; hence the notion of ‘universal’ must be there in regard to number, etc. also

Notions of taste, colour, and heaviness might arise from their ‘subsistence in one and the same thing’; in the case in question (of negation) however, even this subsistence is not there; for the simple reason that negation does not subsist in anything at all 
viśeṣaṇa viśeṣya tva sambandhaḥ api asti ced iha / sambandha antara sadbhāve nanu ca asau prakalpyate // tayoḥ āsattim āśritya viśeṣaṇa viśeṣya tā / kalpyate tad abhāve tu sā animittā na siddhyati  // 	If it be argued that—“in this case there is the relation of qualification—and—qualified”,—then the answer is that such a relation is assumed only when some other relation is already there; for instance, the relation of qualification and qualified is assumed on the basis of the close proximity (contact) between the two factors concerned; in the absence of such contact, the relation in question cannot be possible, as there would be no basis for it

abhāvaḥ abhāvaḥ iti eva jñānam atra avacoditam / upādhi stham ca sāmānyam sva āśrayeṣu eva varttate // 	The objection urged by us was in regard to such notions as ‘this negation’, ‘that negation as regards the ‘universal’ subsisting in the adjunct, that subsists only in its own substratum 
na ca anuyāyi teṣu iṣṭam anyat sattvam yadi iṣyate / na ṣaṣ artha atirekeṇa jāyante abhāva buddhayaḥ // 	Nor is it held that the single all-embracing universal ‘being’ subsists in them all. because notions of ‘negation’ do not appear apart from the six categories

Hence the ‘fallibility’ of the opponent’s reasons remains as before.—Similarly with regard to past and future things,—if there is a cognition of an eternal universal, then no such pure ‘universal’ (without the constituent individuals) can ever be apprehended. Or, if such a pure universal by itself were apprehended, then it could not be the ‘universal’ of any particulars. Such a universal could not be manifestable by particulars; just as the himālaya is not manifestable by the vindhya.—Nor can the universal be tied down to the particulars through its birth being dependent upon these,—nor lastly can the universal be dependent upon the particulars for its cognition, because it is eternal and because it is apprehended purely by itself.—There is also no possibility of its being dependent upon any such thing as the contact of its own substratum with the sense-organ concerned. Consequently this universal could either be apprehended at all times, or not apprehended at any time at all.—As regards its capacity to bring about its own cognition by itself, it may or may not have this capacity; whichsoever way it is, it would always remain so. Its natural form,—with or without the said capacity,—would be unshakeable, because it is itself permanent. Who then, could ever shake what is unshakeable?

What is this ‘subsistence’ meant to be?—Is it staying? Or being manifested? As for ‘staying’, which stands for not deviating from its own form,—this belongs to the universal by its very nature;—any receptacle of it gould not produce this in it, by virtue of which that substratum could be regarded as ‘that which makes it stay as for preventing its movement (which is another form of ‘subsistence’), it cannot belong to the universal, as it does to the jujube fruit (contained in the cup); because the universal is, by its nature, immobile; hence it cannot have a receptacle.—If it be held that ‘staying’ is inherence,—that cannot be accepted; as it is the exact nature of this ‘inherence’ that is being examined. In the form of the relation of the sustainer and sustained which subsists among things never found apart from each other, such ‘inherence’ is admitted by us also

If what was incapable yesterday were made capable (to-day), then the thing would be impermanent,—just like the jar manifested by the lamp 
ghaṭa ādi jāti bhedāḥ ca sva āśrayeṣu eva bhāvinaḥ / sarvatra vṛtti bhājaḥ vā bhaveyuḥ para jāti vat // 	The various universals, ‘jar’ and the rest, could subsist either in their own respective receptacles or in all places,—like the ‘highest universal’ (summum genus) 
tatra deśa antare vastu prādurbhāve katham nu te / dṛśyante vṛtti bhājaḥ vā tasmin iti na gamyate // 	When the thing comes into existence in another place, it is not understood how the universal is perceived there, or how it gains subsistence therein 
na hi tena saha utpannāḥ nitya tvāt na api avasthitāḥ  / tatra prāk avibhu tvena na ca āyānti atas akriyāḥ // 	The universals cannot be said to have come into existence' along with the new jar,—because they are eternal; nor can they be said to have been there already, because (ex hypothesi) they are not all-pervading; nor can they be said to have come from elsewhere, because they are immobile 
sva āśraya indriya yoga ādeḥ ekasmin tad grahe sati / sarvatra eva upalabhyeran tad svarupa avibhāgataḥ // 	When the contact of its substratum with the sense-organ and such other conditions would be present and bring about the cognition of the universal,—that universal would become perceived everywhere; because there can be no division in its form 
jñātāt avyatiriktam ced tasya api grahaṇam bhavet / tadvat eva na vā tasya grahaṇam bhedaḥ eva vā // 	a) If the universal (in the new individual) re not-different from that which has been already perceived,—then there should re perception of that universal also;—or (b) like it, the other also should not be perceived;—or (c) there should be difference

evam ekāntataḥ bhinna jātiḥ eṣā nirākṛtā  / jaiminīya abhyupetā tu syāt vāde pratiṣetsyate // 	Thus has been rejected the ‘universal’ as an entirely distinct entity. as regards the ‘universal’ postulated by the followers of Jaimini, that is going to be rejected under the chapter on ‘syādvāda’ (chapter XX)

If by themselves,—then why is not the same held to be the case with atoms and other things also?

The notion that ‘those two (tree and mountain) subsist in these (branches and the stones)’ however that is put forward (by the opponent) is one that is beyond all ordinary experience.—What such notions as ‘this colour or that action in this jar’ apprehend is identity; the general terms ‘colour’ (‘action’), ‘jar’ connote these things generally, in all states and conditions; hence for the purpose of mentioning their particular forms, they are spoken of in the manner expressed in the said notions ‘and it is on the basis of those particular forms that the notion appears in that form,—not on the basis of ‘inherence’ because the distinction among all these is not perceived

In fact the inherence of the cloth in the yarns must be the same as the inherence of the cloth [read ‘paṭasya’ acc. to comm.] in the potsherds; and hence there could be no restriction in the notion at all

(a) Is it that inherence which has been assumed to constitute the existence of those objects, which inherence continues to exist in the other relatives? Or (b) is it something else, as in the case of conjunction, plurality and so forth?a) It cannot be the former; if the inherence of that kind continues to exist, then the said objects—jar, etc.—also should be there. If they were not there, then the inherence that constitutes their existence could not remain there; or it might be there in mere name.—From all this it follows that even before, as after, the objects could not be subsisting in their substratum, through any such thing as ‘inherence’.

And in that case, the same objections would be applicable. Apart from these, there is found nothing ‘expressed by the verb to be’ 
samudāya abhidhāne api jāti bheda abhidhā sphuṭā / tapaḥ jāti kriyā ādīnām sāmastyena abhidhānataḥ // 	Under the view that what is denoted is the ‘aggregate’, there is clear conception of ‘universals’ and ‘particulars as what are denoted are austerity, caste, conduct and the rest collectively

Then again, this ‘coalescence’ also must reside in the cognition itself, inasmuch as it is different from external relationship. Under the circumstances, what would be the difference between this view and the view that the cognition or idea itself constitutes the import of words?—As regards the view that the form of the idea (or cognition) is what is denoted by words,—that has been already rejected, on the ground that it would be nothing different from the idea and as such could not be pervasive

yadi vā sarvam eva idam kṣaṇikam syat na vā tathā  / kṣaṇika tve anvaya ayogaḥ krami jñānam ca na anyathā  // 	Again, is all this momentary or not? If it is momentary, then there can be no co-ordination. if otherwise, there should be no successive cognition

Or even the word itself? 
sārūpyāt ca śruteḥ vṛttiḥ katham vā a śabda codite / sārūpyā di amalakava nnāma ādi etena dūṣitam // 	How can the word be applied,—merely through similarity,—to what is hot expressed by it?

sāmānyam vastu rūpam hi buddhi ākāraḥ bhaviṣyati / śabda artha prakalpitaḥ // 	In that case, the ‘form of the Cognition which is posited as the ‘Import of Words’, would be the Universal.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 38]

asati api ca bāhye arthe vākya arthaḥ pratibhā yathā  / padārthaḥ api tathā eva syāt kim apohaḥ prakalpyate // 	even in the absence of the corresponding external object there is intuition expressed by the sentence; similar may be the case with what is expressed by the word also; why should the apoha be postulated at all?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 43]

If they are non-entities, then they cannot be many, and hence they cannot escape from being synonymous.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 46] 
nanu ca aśva ādi bhedena bhedaḥ apohasya setsyati / na viśeṣaḥ svatas tasya paratas ca upajāyate // 	There would certainly be difference among Apohas, based upon the difference among the horse and other things.—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 47]a) “In fact, there can be no distinction among Apohas—either by themselves, or through others.”—[ibid.]b)

How much less there is exclusion possible for that which is a non-entity, unrelated, undifferentiated, unspecified, vague and undetermined?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 48-49] 
na ca aprasiddha sārūpyam apoha viṣaya ātmanā / śaktaḥ kaścid api jñātum gavādīn ataḥ // 	As a matter of fact, no one can conceive of the cow and other things—any similarity of form among whom is not admitted,—to be the substratum of Apoha.” 
apohyān api ca aśva ādīn eka dharma anvayāt ṛte / na nirūpayitum śaktiḥ tad apohaḥ na siddhyati // 	In the absence of a common property, it is not possible to determine the things excluded (by Apoha). For this reason also there can be no Apoha.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 72]

ekasmāt tarhi go piṇḍāt yat anyat sarvam eva tat / bhavet apohyam iti etat na sāmānyasya vācya tā // 	In that case, all things, with the sole exception of the single individual cow, would become excluded by the Apoha; and in that case it would not be proved that any commonalty constitutes the import of words.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 82]

abhāva gamya rūpe ca na viśeṣye asti vastu tā / viśeṣitam apohena vastu vācyam na te asti atas // 	If the qualified thing is cognisable in the form of negation, then it cannot be an entity; consequently for you, there can be no entity that could be denoted by words as qualified by Apoha.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 91]

na apohya tvam abhāvānām abhāva abhāva varjanāt / vyaktaḥ apoha antara apohaḥ tasmāt sāmānya vastunaḥ // 	Mere negations cannot be objects of ‘exclusion’,—for, if they were, they would lose their negative character. consequently, it is clear that when there is an ‘exclusion’ (Apoha) of another ‘exclusion’ (Apoha), it can be only of a positive entity in the shape of the commonalty (or universal).”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 96]

tatra asataḥ api bhāva tvam iti kleśaḥ mahān bhavet / tad asiddhau na sattā asti na ca asattā prasiddhyati // 	In that case, even the non-existent (non-being) would have a positive character; which would be a great calamity.—And when there is no negation, there would be no existence (positive) at all; and (as a consequence) non-existence also would be impossible.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 99] 
na ca api vāsanā bhedāt bhedaḥ sat rūpa tā api vā / apohānām prakalpyeta na hi avastuni sā matā // 	Either diversity or the positive character of Apohas cannot be assumed to be due to the diversity of impressions; because impression cannot be held to exist when there is no entity.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 100]

Under the circumstances, if a ‘commonalty’ were assumed in the shape of the ‘Apoha (exclusion) of other words’,—as it could only be a non-entity, as shown above, there could be no diversity among words.—Just as among denotative words, so between the ‘denoted’ and ‘denotative’ also there could be no difference. That there can be no ‘difference’ based upon the difference in the ‘excluded things’ has already been explained.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 102, 104, 105]

Thus there can be no Apoha in the case of the words in question.—Lastly, in the case of such words as ‘eva’, nothing is found to be ‘excluded”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 140-141]

There is no such thing as the non-all, which could be excluded.—If it be urged that ‘one and the rest’ are the non-all, then it comes to be the exclusion of the denotation itself; as the parts would be excluded, and no whole is admitted.—Similarly, in regard to the denotation of the word ‘group’ (‘samūha’), the constituents would be excluded; and nothing apart from this is admitted; hence all such words become deprived of their meaning.—As regards the words ‘two’ and the rest, which also are applied to groups, as the ‘one’ and other constituents would be excluded, they could no longer be so applicable.—Then again, the denotation of the word ‘cow’ is said to be the ‘non-non-cow’;—now is this positive or negative? If it is positive, is it the cow or the non-cow?—If it is the cow, then there is no dispute; as the denotation turns out to be of the positive character. On the other hand, if it is the non-cow that is denoted by the word ‘cow’,—that would exhibit a wonderful insight into the meanings of words indeed!—Nor can it be negative; as, in that case injunction and the rest would not be possible.—Nor does any one ever comprehend a negation from the word ‘cow’.”

Who has ever attributed the character of the non-cow to the cow—that it is denied here?—It is held that it is the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ in the cow, which forms the denotation of the word;—is this held to be something different from the cow? Or non-different?—If it is different, does it abide—or not abide—anywhere? If it does abide, then it becomes a quality, and the word cannot be denotative of the substance;—and thus as the word ‘cow’ would denote only a quality, there would be no co-ordination in such expressions as ‘the cow moves’, ‘the cow stands—if it does not abide in any thing, then what would be the sense in which it could be mentioned, for the purpose of exclusion, by the term ‘agoḥ’, ‘of the non-cow’?—If, lastly, the ‘Apoha’, ‘exclusion of others’ is held by you to be non-different (from the cow),—then it comes to be the same as cow; what more would, in that case, be expressed (by the term ‘Apoha’)?” 
pratibhāvam apohaḥ ayam ekaḥ anekaḥ api vā bhavet / yadi ekaḥ aneka go yuktaḥ go tvam eva bhavet asau // aneka tve api ca ānantyam piṇḍa vat saṃprayujyate / tena bheda vat eva asya vācya tā na upayujyate // 	Is this Apoha one and the same in connection with all things? or is it several?—If one, then, being related to several cows, it would be the same as the universal—‘cow’—if it is several, then it would be endless,—like so many individual objects. consequently, just like the diverse individuals, this also could not be ‘denoted’ 
anya apohaḥ ca kim vācyaḥ kim vā avācyaḥ ayam iṣyate / vācyaḥ api vidhi rūpeṇa yadi vā anya niṣedhataḥ  // vidhi ātmanā asya vācya tve tyājyam ekānta darśanam  / sarvatra anya nirāsaḥ ayam śabda arthaḥ iti varṇitam  // atha apoha vyudāsena yadi apohaḥ abhidhīyate / tatra tatra evam icchāyām anavasthā bhavet tatas  // atha api avācyaḥ eva ayam yadi apohaḥ tvayā iṣyate / tena anya apoha kṛt śabdaḥ iti bādhyeta te vacaḥ 	This Apoha, ‘exclusion of other things’—is it itself denoted or not-denoted? Even if it is denoted, is it denoted as something positive? Or only as the ‘negation of other things’?—If it is denoted as something positive, then you should abandon your extremist view, whereby it has been asserted that ‘in every case it is the exclusion of other things that is denoted by words.’—If, on the other hand, the said ‘exclusion’ (Apoha) is denoted in the form of the ‘exclusion of other things’,—then such a view would involve an infinite regress.—If then it be held by you that the said Apoha (exclusion of other things) is not denoted, then your assertion, that ‘the word always brings about the exclusion of other things’, would become annulled.” 
api ca eka tva nitya tva pratyeka samavāyi tāḥ  / nirupākhyeṣu apoheṣu kurvataḥ a sūtrakaḥ paṭaḥ // tasmāt yeṣu eva śabdeṣu nañ yogaḥ teṣu kevalam / bhavet anya nivṛtti aṃśaḥ sva ātmā eva anyatra gamyate // 	Further, one-ness, eternality and subsistence in every individual,—ore who would attribute these to Apohas which are peatureless, would be making cloth without yarns.—From all this it follows that the element of ‘exclusion of others’ could be present only in the denotation of those words wherein the negative term is present; in all other cases the thing itself is what is denoted.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 163-164] 
anya apoha aparijñānāt evam ete kudṛṣṭayaḥ / svayam naṣṭhāḥ durātmānaḥ nāśayanti parān api // tathā hi dvividhaḥ apohaḥ paryudāsa niṣedhataḥ / dvividhaḥ paryudāsaḥ api buddhi ātma artha ātma bhedataḥ // 	All these are wrong views based upon ignorance of what is meant by the ‘apoha, negation, of other things’.—People who are themselves damned damn others also.—As a matter of fact, Apoha is of two kinds due to difference between Paryudāsa (relative negation, contradistinction, exclusion) and (2) niṣedha (absolute negation, denial, prohibition). Paryudāsa again is of two kindsa) due to difference of conception (idea), and (b) due to difference of concept (object) 
eka pratyavamarśasya ye uktāḥ hetavaḥ purā / abhaya ādi samāḥ arthāḥ prakṛtyā eva anya bhedinaḥ // tān upāśritya yat jñāne bhāti artha pratibimbakam / kalpake artha ātma tā abhāve api arthāḥ iti eva niścitam // 	It has been explained on a previous occasion (text 723) that things like the Harītakī and other things, though distinct from one another, become the basis of unitary conception. on the basis of such things, there appears a reflection in the determinate cognition,—which reflection is definitely apprehended (conceived of) as ‘objects’, even though the objective character is absent in it. [And it is this conception of the reflected image that is called ‘Apoha’] 
pratibhāsa antarāt bhedāt anya vyāvṛtta vastunaḥ  / prāpti hetu tayā aśliṣṭa vastu dvārā gatyāḥ api // vijātīya parāvṛttam tat phalam yat svalakṣaṇam / tasmin adhyavasāyāt vā tādātmyena asya viplutaiḥ  // tatra anya apohaḥ iti eṣā saṃjñā uktā sa nibandhanā / 	Because it appears as ‘excluded’ (distinguished) from other ‘appearances’, because it is the basis (cause) of the cognition of a thing as ‘excluded’ from others, because it is cognised through an entity ‘excluded’ (from others),—and (4) because it is apprehended in the form of the ‘specific individuality’ consisting in the ‘exclusion’ of unlike things, by persons confounded by its sameness—the name ‘Apoha, exclusion, of others’ has been given to it, on the said basis 
sva lakṣaṇe api tad hetau anya viśleṣa bhāvataḥ // 	So also, in regard to the ‘specific individuality’ which is the basis of the said ‘exclusion’;—on the ground that there is in it the ‘exclusion’ of others 
prasajya pratiṣedhaḥ ca gauḥ agauḥ na bhavati ayam / ati vispaṣṭaḥ eva ayam anya apohaḥ avagamyate // 	Negation absolute’ we have in such instances as ‘the cow is not non-cow’; in this the ‘negation of the other’ is very clearly apprehended 
tatra ayam prathamaḥ śabdaiḥ apohaḥ pratipādyate / bāhya artha adhyavasāyinyāḥ buddheḥ śabdāt samudbhavāt // 	It is the first of these Apohas that is expressed by words; because the cognition brought about by words apprehends the external object 
tad rūpa pratibimbasya dhiyaḥ śabdāt ca janmani / vācya vācaka bhāvaḥ ayam jātaḥ hetu phala ātmakaḥ // 	When the cognition of the reflection in that form has resulted from the word, there has come about the relation of denoted and denotative, in the shape of cause and effect 
sākṣāt ākāraḥ etasmin evam ca pratipādite / prasajya pratiṣedhaḥ api sāmarthyena pratīyate // na tadā ātmā parātmā iti sambandhe sati vastubhiḥ / vyāvṛtta vastu adhigamaḥ api arthāt eva bhavati atas  // tena ayam api śabdasya svārthaḥ iti upacaryate / na tu sākṣāt ayam śābdaḥ dvividhaḥ apohaḥ ucyate // 	The direct form (of Apoha) having been explained as above, absolute negation also is apprehended by implication,—in the form that the nature of this thing is not the nature of the other thing.—When there is connection (of the word) with certain things, there comes about, by implication, the apprehension of ‘excluded’ things also.—Hence this also is figuratively spoken of as the ‘denotation’ of the word,—these two kinds of verbal Apoha are not directly spoken of as such 
artha antara vyavacchedam kurvatī śrutiḥ ucyate / abhidhatte iti svārtham iti etat avirodhi tat // 	When the word brings about the exclusion of other things, it is said to ‘denote its own meaning’; and there is no incongruity in this 
bāhya artha adhyavasāyena pravṛttam pratibimbakam / utpādayati yena iyam tena āha iti apadiśyate // na tu sva lakṣaṇa ātmānam spṛśati eṣā vibhedinam / tanmātra aṃśa atirekeṇa na asti asyāḥ abhidhā kriyā // 	The word is said to ‘denote’, because it produces a reflection of the conception of the external thing; it does not touch the exclusive factor in the shape of the specific individuality; apart from the said production of the reflection, there is no other denotative function of the word 
tasya ca pratibimbasya gatau eva anugamyate / sāmarthyāt anya viśleṣaḥ na asya anya ātmaka tā yatas // 	It is only when the reflection has been cognised that there follows the ‘exclusion of other things’, by implication; because the idea of ‘others’ does not form part of the reflection at all 
divā bhojana vākya ādeḥ iva asya api phala dvayam a  / sākṣāt sāmarthyataḥ yasmāt na anvayaḥ avyatirekavān // 	As in the case of the sentence speaking of ‘not eating at night’, the word in question has two fruits (resultants),—one direct and the other by implication; and it is so because there is no affirmation entirely without negation 
na abhimukhyena kurute yasmāt śabdaḥ idam dvayam / svārtha abhidhānam anyasya vinivṛttim ca vastunaḥ // 	Because the word does hot directly bring about both these, the idea of its own denotation, and (2) the exclusion of another thing 
tādṛśaḥ pratibhāsaḥ ca sāmānyam go tvam iṣyate / sarvatra śābaleya ādau samāna tva avasāyataḥ // 	The universal ‘cow’ also is held to be an appearance of the same kind; inasmuch it is apprehended as common to all cows—the variegated and the rest 1022) commentary. 
vastu iti adhyavasāyāt ca vastu iti api tat ucyate / jhaṭiti eva hi tat jñānam bhrāntam jātam sva bījataḥ // 	Because it is cognised as a positive ‘entity’, therefore it is called a ‘positive entity’;—this mistaken cognition is produced quickly from its seed 
saḥ eva ca tad ākāra śabda arthaḥ apohaḥ ucyate / sāmānyam vastu rūpam ca tathā bhrāntyā avasāyataḥ // 	That same ‘form of the cognition’ called the ‘Apoha’, is the ‘denotation of the word’,—also (regarded as) a ‘positive entity in the form of the ‘commonalty’; on account of its being apprehended as such, through mistake 
sāmānya vastu rūpa tvam na yuktam tu asya bhāvikam / buddheḥ ananya rūpam hi yāyāt artha antaram katham // 	It is not right to regard its character of universal entity, as real; being non-different from the cognition, how could it appertain to another thing? 
yadi api avyatiriktaḥ ayam ākāraḥ buddhi rūpataḥ / tathā api bāhya rūpa tvam bhāntaiḥ tasya avasīyate // 	Though this form of ‘Apoha’ is not different from the form of the cognition, yet its external character is apprehended only by deluded persons 
tasya na artha anapekṣa tvam pāramparyāt tad āgateḥ / tena ātmanā ca vastu tvam na eva asti iti upapāditam // 	It is not entirely independent of the object, inasmuch as the notion of that comes in indirectly; and yet in that form, the character of positive entity does not belong to it, as explained before 
pratibimba ātmakaḥ apohaḥ padāt api upajāyate / pratibhā ākhyaḥ jhaṭiti eva padārthaḥ api ayam eva naḥ // 	That Apoha which is in the form of reflection, and which also is called ‘intuition’, is produced by the word also; and we readily regard this as the denotation of words 
svarūpa utpāda mātrāt hi na anyam aṃśam bibhartti sā / buddhi antarāt vyavacchedaḥ tena buddheḥ pratīyate // 	Owing to the fact of its not bearing any factor apart from the appearance of its own form, its ‘exclusion from another cognition’ becomes duly apprehended 
yathā eva avidyamānasya na bhedaḥ pāramārthikaḥ / abhedaḥ api tathā eva iti tena paryāya tā bhavet // 	In the case of what does not exist, any difference that may be there cannot be real; so also would be its non-difference; and hence the words would certainly be synonymous 
abhedaḥ hi eka rūpa tvam nīrūpeṣu ca tat kutas / eka tve arthasya paryāyāḥ prāpnuvanti ca vācakāḥ // 	Non-difference’ consists in being of the same form; how can this be there in what are formless? Words become synonyms only when what is denoted by them is one and the same 
rūpa abhāve api ca eka tvam kalpanā nirmitam yathā / vibhedaḥ api tathā eva iti kutas paryāya tā tatas // 	Just as, even in the absence of form, there is imaginary unity (uniformity),—in the same manner, difference also could be imaginary; whence then could the words be synonymous? 
bhāvataḥ tu na paryāyāḥ na aparyāyāḥ ca vācakāḥ / nahi ekam bāhyam eteṣām anekam ca iti varṇitam // 	In reality, words are neither synonymous nor not-synonymous; as it has been explained that what is denoted by them is neither one and the same nor diverse 
kiṃtu anekaḥ api yadi eka kārya kārī yaḥ īkṣyate / tatra eka dharma āropeṇa śrutiḥ ekā niveśyate // 	But whenever more than one thing is seen to be performing one and the same function, the property of ‘oneness’ is imposed on them and the same word is applied to them 
locana ādau yathā rūpa vijñāna eka phale kvacid / kaścid yadi śrutim kuryāt vinā ekena anugāminā // 	In the case of the eye and other things, all tending to bring about the single effect in the shape of the cognition of colour,—if someone were to apply a common name, even without a comprehensive (common) element [in the same manner would it be in other cases also] 
ghaṭa ādīnām ca yat kāryam jala ādeḥ dhāraṇa ādikam / yat ca tad viṣayam jñānam bhinnam yadi api tad dvayam // eka pratyavamarśasya hetu tvāt ekam ucyate / jñānam tathā api tad hetu bhāvāt arthāḥ abhedinaḥ // 	Though the action of the jar and other things, in the shape of holding water, etc.,—and also the cognition of those things,—are different (diverse),—yet, as it forms the basis of a single (comprehensive) conception, the cognition is said to be one only; and as this cognition forms the basis, the things also are spoken of as not-diverse (one) 
tatra sāmānya vacanāḥ uktāḥ śabdāḥ ghaṭa ādayaḥ / vijātīya vyavacchinna pratibimba eka hetavaḥ // 	Of these, words like ‘jar’ have been said to be common denotatives, on the single basis of the reflection distinguished (excluded) from unlike things 
tathā aneka artha kāri tvāt ekaḥ na ekaḥ iva ucyate / a tad kārya parāvṛtti bāhulya parikalpitaḥ // 	Similarly, when performing several fruitful functions, even a single thing is spoken of as if it were many,—by virtue of the multiplicity of the exclusions of things not performing those functions 
yathā sa pratigham rūpam sa nidarśanam iti api / prayatna anantara jñātaḥ yathā vā śrāvaṇaḥ dhvaniḥ // 	For instance, colour is spoken of as an ‘obstacle’ and also as ‘visible’;—and sound is spoken of as ‘cognised after effort’, and also as ‘auditory’ or ‘audible 
a tad kāraṇa bhedena kvacid śabdaḥ niveśyate / prayatna utthaḥ yathāśabdaḥ bhrāmaram vā yathā madhu // 	In some cases, the word is applied, also on the basis of the diversity of other causes; e.g. sound arising from effort, and the honey produced by the large bees 
tad kārya hetu viśleṣāt kvacid śrutiḥ iha ucyate / a śrāvaṇam yathā rūpam vidyut vā ayatna jā yathā // 	In some cases, the word is applied on the basis of the exclusion of the effect and cause of the thing; as for example, colour is spoken of as ‘inaudible’, or lightning is spoken of as ‘not produced by effort’ 
ityādinā prabhedena vibhinna artha nibandhanāḥ / vyāvṛttayaḥ prakalpyante tad niṣṭhāḥ śrutayaḥ tathā // yathāsaṅketam eva atas asaṅkīrṇa artha abhidhāyinaḥ / śabdāḥ vivekataḥ vṛttāḥ paryāyāḥ na bhavanti naḥ // 	Due to the said and other distinctions, ‘exclusions’ are postulated on the basis of differentiated things; and so also are the words as applied to those things. thus words, as denoting distinct things in accordance with convention, are applied with due differentiation; and as such they are not synonymous under our view 
bahu alpa viṣaya tvena tad saṅketa anumānataḥ / sāmānya bheda vācya tvam api eṣām na virudhyate // 	Nor is there any incongruity in universals and particulars being denoted by words, as appertaining to larger and smaller number of things,—on the basis of the inference of the relevant convention 
tāḥ ca vyāvṛttayaḥ arthānā kalpanā mātra nirmitāḥ / na apohya ādhāra bhedena bhidyante paramārthataḥ // 	The said ‘exclusions’ of things, created by mere assumption, cannot really differ, through difference in the ‘excluded things’, or through that in the substratum 
tāsām hi bāhya rūpa tvam kalpitam tat na vāstavam / bheda abhedau ca tattvena vastuni eva vyavasthitau // 	The externality that is attributed to these exclusions is only assumed (imaginary), not real. in reality, difference and non-difference subsist only in real things 
sva bīja aneka viśliṣṭa vastu saṅketa śaktitaḥ  / vikalpāḥ tu vibhidyante tad rūpa adhyavasāyinaḥ // na eka ātma tām prapadyante ca bhidyante ca khaṇḍaśas / sva lakṣaṇa ātmakāḥ arthāḥ vikalpaḥ plavate tu asau // 	What differ among themselves are the conceptual contents apprehending the said exclusions;—and those differences are due to the influence of their root, the thing as differentiated from several things, and convention. Things, consisting of ‘specific individualities’ do not become either unified or diversified in parts; it is only the conceptual content that varies 
eka dharma anvaya asattve api apohya apoha gocarāḥ / vailakṣaṇyena gamyante bhinna pratyavamarśataḥ // 	Even though there is no common property, yet what are excluded and what are contained in the exclusion are apprehended as different, by reason of their appearing as diverse in the subsequent determinate judgment 
eka pratyavamarśe hi kecid eva upayoginaḥ / prakṛtyāḥ bhedavat tve api na anyaḥ iti upapāditam // 	It would be only a few things which, while being diverse by themselves, would bring about a single determinate judgment; as already explained by us 
a tad rūpa parāvṛttam vastu mātram sva lakṣaṇam / yatnena kriyamāṇaḥ ayam anvayaḥ na virudhyate // 	The ‘specific individuality’ consists of the thing-by-itself, as ‘excluded from what is not itself’;—an assertion of concomitance carefully made in this form would not be incongruous 
yasmin adhūmataḥ bhinnam vidyate hi svalakṣaṇam / tasmin anagnitaḥ api asti parāvṛttam svalakṣaṇam // yathā mahānase ca iha vidyate adhūma bhedi tat / tasmāt anagnitaḥ bhinnam vidyate atra svalakṣaṇam // 	That wherein subsists the specific individuality (smoke) differentiated from non-smoke,—in that same subsists also the specific individuality (fire) differentiated from non-fire; as in the kitchen; and herein (in the hill) there is the specific individuality differentiated from non-smoke;—hence the specific individuality differentiated from non-fire also must be there 
asataḥ nara śṛṅga ādeḥ yat ca bhinnam sva lakṣaṇam  / buddhi dīpa ādi vat sarvam vyāvṛttam tat sthirāt api // asat rūpam tathā ca idam na śabda ādi sva lakṣaṇam  / ittham nirdiṣṭa bhedena bhavati eva anvayaḥ amunā // 	The specific individuality that is differentiated from ‘man’s horns’ and other non-existent things is also differentiated from permanent things,—just as the cognition, the lamp-flame, etc. are;—the specific individuality of sound, etc. is not a non-existent thing.—In this way there can be the assertion of concomitance through differences as indicated 
avivikṣata bhedam ca tat eva parikīrttitam / sāmānya lakṣaṇa tvena na aniṣṭeḥ aparam punar // 	The specific individuality itself, when its distinction is not meant to be emphasised, has been described as constituting the ‘universal’ (or commonalty);—nothing else; as nothing else is acceptable 
śabala apatyataḥ bhede bāhuleya aśvayoḥ same / turaṅga parihāreṇa go tvam kim tatra varttate // 	The difference from the variegated cow being equally present in the black cow and the horse, why is it that the universal ‘cow’, as differentiated from the horse, subsists in that? 
tasya vyaktau samartha ātmā saḥ eva iti yadi iṣyate / tulya pratyavamarśe api sa śaktaḥ na turaṃgamaḥ // 	If it be held that ‘that alone has the capacity to manifest it’—then, even though the subsequent determinate judgment is the same, that alone has the capacity to produce it, and not the horse 
tādṛś pratyavamarśaḥ ca vidyate yatra vastuni / tatra abhāve api go jāteḥ ago apohaḥ pravarttate // 	Thus then, in whatever thing the said determinate judgment is present,—to that the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ becomes applicable,—even in the absence of the universal ‘cow’ 
a go bhinnam ca yat vastu tat akṣaiḥ vyavasīyate / pratibimbam tat adhyastam sva saṃvittyā avagamyate // idam dṛṣṭvā ca lekena śabdaḥ tatra prayujyate / saṃbandha anubhavaḥ api asya vyaktam tena upapadyate // 	That thing which is ‘different from the non-cow’ is certainly apprehended by the sense-organs; the reflection also which is superimposed upon it is apprehended by its own cognition. it is on noticing this that people use the word; the recognition of its relation also becomes clearly explained on the same basis 
tādṛś pratyavamarśaḥ ca yatra na eva asti vastuni / a go śabda abhidheya tvam vispaṣṭam tatra gamyate // 	When, in regard to anything, there is no such determinate judgment, the fact of its being denoted by the word ‘non-cow’ becomes clearly perceived 
gāvaḥ agāvaḥ ca saṃsiddhāḥ bhinna pratyavamarśataḥ  / śabdaḥ tu kevalaḥ asiddhaḥ yatheṣṭam saṃprayujyate // na hi anya grahaṇam vastu bhinnam vittau apekṣate / anyonya āśraya doṣaḥ ayam tasmāt asmin nirāspadaḥ // 	The cow and the non-cow are both well-established,—as there are distinct determinate judgments in regard to both; it is only the word that is not well-established; and hence it is applied according to the speaker’s whim.—As a matter of fact, a distinct thing does not need for its apprehension, the apprehension of another thing; hence there is no room here for the charge of ‘mutual interdependence’ 
avedya bāhya tattvā api prakṛṣṭa upaplavāt iyam  / sva ullekham bāhya rūpeṇa śabda dhīḥ adhyavasyati // etāvat kriyate śabdaiḥ na artham śabdāḥ spṛśanti api / na apohena viśiṣṭaḥ ca kaścid arthaḥ abhidhīyate // 	As a matter of fact, verbal cognition, not taking cognizance of any external object, apprehends its own mark as something external, on account of strong illusion.—This is all that is done by words; and words do not even, touch the object; nor is any object denoted as qualified by Apoha. 
artha antara nivṛttyā āhuḥ viśiṣṭān iti yat punar / proktam lakṣaṇakāreṇa tatra arthaḥ ayam vivakṣitaḥ // 	As for the statement made by the author of the lakṣaṇa—that ‘words express things qualified by the exclusion of other things’, what it means is as follows 
anya anya tvena ye bhāvāḥ hetunā karaṇena vā / viśiṣṭāḥ bhinna jātīyaiḥ asaṅkīrṇāḥ viniścitāḥ  // vṛkṣa ādīn āhatān dhvānaḥ tad bhāva adhyasāyinaḥ  / jñānasya utpādanāt etat jāti ādeḥ pratiṣedhanam // 	Those things that are qualified by the exclusion of other things,—either as their cause or their instruments—are definitely cognised as not mixed up with things of other kinds. The word expresses these things. and, because it brings about the cognition apprehending those things, there is denial of the ‘universal’ and such other commonalities 
buddhau ye vā vivarttante tān āha ābhyantarān ayam / nivṛttyā ca viśiṣṭa tvam uktam eṣām anantaram // 	Those things however which appear in the cognition—these internal (subjective) things the word denotes directly; and the fact of these things being qualified by ‘exclusion’ has just been explained 
artha antara parāvṛttyā gamyate tasya vastunaḥ / kaścid bhāgaḥ iti proktam tat eva pratibimbakam // 	When it is said that ‘a certain portion of the thing is apprehended by the exclusion of other things’,—it is the said reflection that is meant 
artha antara parāvṛtta vastu darśana saṃśrayāt / āgatyāḥ tatra ca āropāt tasya bhāgaḥ apadiśyate // 	It is spoken of as a portion of the object, because it proceeds on the basis of the perception of the object as ‘excluded from other things’, and because it is superimposed upon the object 
hetvarthaḥ karaṇa arthaḥ ca pūrvavat tena vā ātmanā / yadi vastu vijātīyāt na syāt bhinnam na tat tathā // 	As before, the instrumental ending may signify either the cause or the instrument. or it may signify that it is ‘in that form’.—If the thing were not differentiated from unlike things, then it could not be so 
ago nivṛttiḥ anya tvam tasya ca ātma gatā eva sā / bheda uktau api abhāvaḥ tu kevalaḥ na nivarttate // tad viśeṣaṇa bhāve api vastu dhīḥ na vihīyate / kalpanā nirmitam ca idam abhede api viśeṣaṇam  // sā upakṛṣya tatas dharmaḥ sthāpitaḥ bhedavān iva / yena daṇḍa ādi vat tasya jāyate hi viśeṣaṇam // 	What is meant by (the cow) being ‘different’ is only the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’; and this exclusion is of the nature of that same difference.—Even when the difference has been asserted, the thing itself does not entirely disappear. Thus even when it has the nature of the qualification, the cognition of the thing does not cease. even when there is non-difference, the qualification is there as a creation of fancy. That character, having been withdrawn therefrom, has been placed there as if different; whereby it becomes its qualification, like the stick and other things 
pratibhāsaḥ ca śabda arthaḥ iti āhuḥ tattva cintakāḥ / dṛśya kalpa avibhāga jñaḥ lokaḥ bāhyam tu manyate // tasya atas adhyavasāyena vyaktīnām eva vācya tā / tattvataḥ ca na śabdānām vācyam asti iti sādhitam // 	Discriminators of truth declare that what is denoted by the word is mere ‘reflection’. People, not knowing the distinction between what is ‘perceived’ and what is ‘fancied’ regard it to be something ‘external—as that is what is apprehended (by words), individuals are denoted by words.—In reality however there is nothing that is denoted by words,—as has been proved already 
ittham ca śabda vācya tvāt vyaktīnām asti apohya tā / sāmānyasya tu na apohaḥ na ca apohe api vastu tā // 	Thus, individuals being denoted by words, they are also capable of being ‘excluded’. As regards the universal, there can be no ‘exclusion even if there were ‘exclusion’ of it, it could not have the character of the ‘entity’ 
na abhābaḥ apohyate hi evam na abhāvaḥ abhāvaḥ iti ayam / bhāvaḥ tu na tadā ātmā iti tasya iṣṭā evam apohyatā // 	Negation is not ‘excluded’ (denied) in the words ‘negation is not negation’; it is however clearly ‘excluded’ (denied) in such expressions as ‘the entity is not of the nature of negation’ 
yaḥ nāma na yadā ātmā hi sa tasya apohaḥ ucyate / na bhāvaḥ abhāva rūpaḥ ca tad apohe na vastu tā // 	When one thing is not of the nature of another, it is called its ‘Apoha’ (exclusion, negation), and the entity is not of the nature of negation. but even though there is ‘Apoha’ of negation, it does not acquire the character of the positive entity 
prakṛti īśa ādi janya tvam vastūnām na iti codite / prakṛti īśa ādi janya tvam na hi vastu prasiddhyati  // 	Even though it is urged that ‘things are not produced by primordial matter or god and so forth’,—the character of being produced by primordial matter, god and so forth does not become a positive entity 
na atas asataḥ api bhāva tvam iti kleśaḥ na kañcana / tasya siddhau ca sattā asti sā ca asattā prasidhyati // 	Thus then there is no such calamity as that of the non-existent becoming a positive entity. In fact, even on the establishment of the negation, the existence remains there (in the entity),—and the non-existence (of the negation) becomes established thereby 
agotaḥ vinivṛttiḥ ca gauḥ vilakṣaṇaḥ iṣyate / bhāvaḥ eva tatas na ayam gauḥ agoḥ me prasajyate // 	The cow, which is ‘the negation of the non-cow’ is held to be a positive entity, and of a character different from that of the non-cow; but by this the non-cow does not become the cow, for me 
avastu viṣaye api asti cetaḥ mātra vinirmitā  / vicitra kalpanā bheda raciteṣu iva vāsanā // tatas ca vāsanā bhedāt bhedaḥ sat rūpa tā api ca / prakalpyate hi apohānām kalpanā raciteṣu iva // 	Even in regard to non-entities, there can be impressions, created only by the mind (cognitions),—just as in the case of things of various kinds created by imagination. This diversity among Apohas, as also their positive character, would be assumed on the basis of the diversity among impressions; just as in the case of creations of imagination 
yādṛśaḥ artha antara apohaḥ vācyaḥ ayam pratipāditaḥ / śabda antara vyapohaḥ api tādṛś eva avagamyatām // 	Just as we have explained the fact of ‘the exclusion of other things’ being denoted by words,—exactly in the same manner should be understood the ‘exclusion of other words’ also 
vastu iti adhyavasāya tvāt na avastu tvam apohayoḥ / prasiddham sāṃvṛte mārge tāttvike tu iṣṭa sādhanam // 	Inasmuch as the Apohas are apprehended as ‘things’ they cannot be regarded as non-entities; this is well known and admitted as pertaining to the illusory aspect of things. as regards the real aspect, what the opponent seeks to prove is accepted by us already 
na vācyam vācakam vā api parama arthena kiñcana / kṣaṇabhaṅgiṣu bhāveṣu vyāpaka tva viyogataḥ // 	In reality, there can be nothing that can be either denoter or denoted,—as all things being in perpetual flux, no concomitance is possible 
tad gamya gamaka tvam ced sāṃvṛtam pratiṣidhyate / tāttvikīm samupāśritya vinivṛttyoḥ avastu tām // tathā api vyabhicāri tvam durvāram anuṣajyate / vikalpa racitaiḥ arthaiḥ śabdaiḥ tad vācakaiḥ api // 	If it is the illusory relation of denoter and denoted that is denied; on the basis of the real fact of the two exclusions being non-entities,—even so, ‘falsity’ becomes unavoidable; in view of such words and things denoted by them as are the creation of imagination 
na hi teṣu asti sāmānyam vācyam tasya ca vācakam / na vācaka tvam śabdasya kṣaṇabhaṅgi svalakṣaṇam // 	As a matter of fact, there is ho ‘universal’ (commonalty) in the case of the things in question, which could be denoted; nor is there any universal word denotative of that universal; nor does the denotative character belong to the word, as specific individualities are all in perpetual flux 
tasmāt tat dvayam eṣṭavyam pratibimba ādi sāṃvṛtam / teṣu tad vyabhicāri tvam durnivāram avasthitam // 	Hence both of these should be held to consist in the illusory ‘reflection’ etc.—Thus in view of these, the ‘falsity’ remains unshaken 
vidhi rūpaḥ ca śabda arthaḥ yena na abhyupagamyate / tad ābham jāyate cetaḥ śabdāt artha avasāyi hi // svārtha abhidhāne śabdānām arthāt anya nivartanam  / tad yogaḥ vyatirekaḥ api mama tad pūrvakaḥ hi asau // 	For the man by whom the denotation of words is not admitted to be anything positive, the mind (cognition) reflecting the thing is what is brought about by the word, and this cognition ultimately brings about the idea of the thing. When words express their meanings, there is, by implication, the exclusion of other things; and through the presence of this there is negation also, as preceded by the apprehension of the positive thing.— 
asambhavaḥ vidheḥ uktaḥ sāmānya ādeḥ asambhavāt / śabdānām ca vikalpānām vastunaḥ viṣaya tvataḥ // 	The ‘impossibility of the positive’ has been averred oh the ground that such things as the ‘universal’ and the like cannot form the subject of words and determinate conceptions 
nīlotpala ādi śabdebhyaḥ ekaḥ eva avasīyate / anīla anutpala ādibhyaḥ vyāvṛttam pratibimbakam // 	From the term ‘blue-lotus’, only one thing is cognised,—and that is the reflection excluded (differentiated) from the ‘non-blue’ and the ‘non-lotus’ 
na tu anya apoha vat vastu vācyam asmābhiḥ iṣyate  / vyāvṛttāt anyatas abhāvāt na anyāt vyāvṛttiḥ asti naḥ // tad pāratantrya doṣaḥ yam jātau iva na saṃgataḥ  / avadātam iti prokte śabdasya arthe apṛthaktvataḥ  // viśeṣaṇa viśeṣya tva sāmānādhikaraṇyayoḥ / tasmāt apohe śabda arthe vyavasthā na virudhyate 	We do not hold that what the word denotes is the thing endowed with the ‘exclusion (Apoha) of other things’; because for us, there is no ‘exclusion’ other than the thing excluded from something else. Hence the objection that ‘it is dependent upon something else’ is not applicable to the ‘denotation of words’ as honestly explained,—in the way that it is to the theory of the ‘universal’ (being denoted by words). because there is no difference between the relation of qualification and qualified and ‘co-ordination’. Consequently there is no incongruity in the theory that it is Apoha that is denoted by words 
kevalāt nīla śabda ādeḥ viśiṣṭam pratibimbakam / kokila utpala bhṛṅga ādau plavamānam pravarttate // pikāñjana ādi apohena viśiṣṭa viṣayam punar / tat indīvara śabdena sthāpyate pariniścitam // sāmānādhikaraṇya ādiḥ evam astin na bādhitaḥ / parapakṣe tu sarveṣām tad vyavasthā ati durghaṭā // 	When the word ‘blue’ is uttered alone, the particular ‘reflection’ that appears is one that scintillates through all blue things such as the cuckoo, the lotus, the blue bee and the like.—When the word ‘lotus’ is added to it, then the cuckoo, the collyrium and other blue things become ‘excluded’, and the resultant reflection is one that is further particularised and becomes definitely applied to one blue thing only.—Thus the necessary co-ordination is not rendered impossible. All this explanation is absolutely impossible under the theory of the other party 
tathā hi ekena śabdena sarvathā uktam sva lakṣaṇam / tathā ca abhihite tasmin kasmāt bheda antare abhatiḥ // yad artham aparaḥ śabdaḥ prayujyeta atra vastutas  / sarvathā abhihite no ced tat anekam prasajyate // 	By the single word, the specific individuality becomes expressed in its entirety; and when that has been denoted, why should there be non-cognition of other things,—for the sake of which another word would be pronounced,—when, in reality, the thing has been denoted in its entirety?—If not, then it becomes more than one 
nīla jātiḥ guṇaḥ vā api nīla śabdena ced gataḥ  / anya indīvara jātiḥ tu vyavaseya utpala śruteḥ // evam sati tayoḥ bhedāt bakula utpala śabda vat / sāmānādhikaraṇya ādi sutarām na upapadyate // 	If the universal ‘blue’, or the quality blue, is denoted by the word ‘blue’, then the word ‘lotus’ (pronounced with that word) should denote another universal ‘lotus’;—such being the case, there would be difference between the two words, just as there is between the words ‘bakula’ (a kind of flower) and ‘utpala’ (lotus); so that any co-ordination, etc. between them will be all the more impossible 
guṇa tad jāti sambaddham dravyam ced pratipādyate / nīla śabdena yadi evam vyarthā syāt utpala śrutiḥ // tābhyām yat eva sambaddham tat eva utpala jātimat / nīla śrutyā eva tatra uktam vyarthā nīlotpala śrutiḥ // 	If it is the substance related to the quality and the universal that is denoted by the word ‘blue’, then the word ‘lotus’ would be useless. as what is related to the said two factors (quality and universal) is exactly what is equipped with the universal ‘lotus’; and as this will have been already expressed by the word ‘blue’, the word ‘lotus’ would be useless 
guṇa tad jāti sambaddhāt anyat utpala jātimat / yadi bhinna āśraye syātām punar nīlotpala śrutī // 	If what belongs to the universal ‘lotus’ is different from what is related to the quality and universal (blue),—then the words ‘blue’ and ‘lotus’ cannot be co-substrate (co-ordinated) 
atha utpala tva sambandhi rūpa tvena na codayet / guṇa tad jāti sambaddham dravyam nīlam iti dhvaniḥ // syāt nāma utpala tā yogi rūpa tvam a tad ātmakam  / utpala tvena sambaddham tvābhyām sambaddham eva tat // nīla śrutyā ca tat proktam śābdyā atra viṣayīkṛtam  / buddhyā sarva ātmanā na aṃśauḥ tad anartha utpala śrutiḥ 	If the word ‘blue’ does not denote the substance related to the quality and the universal (blue) as related to the universal ‘lotus’,—then the substance as related to the universal ‘lotus’ should be something totally different; as a matter of fact, what is related to the universal ‘lotus’ is that same substance that is related to the other two (quality and universal ‘blue’); and that substance has already been expressed, in its entirety—not in part,—by the word ‘blue’,—and has also been apprehended by the verbal cognition brought about by that word;—so that the word ‘lotus’ would be entirely useless 
na ced bheda vinirmukte kārtsnya bheda vikalpanam / na vākya artha aparijñānāt idam hi atra vivakṣitam // prathamena eva śabdena sarvathā tat prakāśitam / na ātmā kaścid parityaktaḥ yādṛśam tat tathā uditam // 	If (it be said that), in regard to a thing devoid of plurality, the assumption of the alternatives of ‘entirety’ and ‘severality’ (‘plurality’) is not possible,—bitch an assertion could only proceed from ignorance of the meaning of the sentence (used by us), what we made clear was that the first word ‘blue’ itself expressed all that had to be expressed, and no part of itself was left (unexpressed). 
etena eva prakāreṇa na anyeṣām api udīraṇam / saphalam tatra śabdānām uktau paryāya tā dhruvam // 	In this same way, the tittering of other words also would be fruitless. in fact, the utterance of such words would only mean so many synonyms 
asmākam tu na śabdena bāhya arthaḥ pratipādyate / śabdāt na ca api vijñānam bāhya artha viṣayam matam // yatas sarva ātmanā tābhyām viṣayīta karaṇāt param / śabda jñāna antaram tatra paryāya tvam prayāsyati // 	For us, no external thing is expressed by the word; nor is any idea of external things held to proceed from words,—by virtue of which, the thing in its entirety having been taken up by these two, any subsequent word would be a mere synonym of that word 
pratibimbam tu śabdena krameṇa eva upajanyate / eka tvena ca tat bhāti bāhya tvena ca vibhramāt // sāmānādhikaraṇya ādi pratibimba anurodhataḥ / parama arthena śabdāḥ tu matāḥ nirviṣayāḥ ime // 	What is produced by the word, in due course, is only the reflection; and it is through delusion that this appears as one and as external. The co-ordination and other relations are due to the reflection. In reality, all these words are held to be objectless 
liṅga saṅkhyā ādi yogaḥ tu vyaktīnām api na asti ayam / icchā racita saṅketa nimittaḥ nahi vāstavaḥ // 	As for the connection of gender and number, it is not present in individuals also; in fact, such connection is based entirely upon conventions set up by the whims of people; it is nothing real 
vivakṣā anugata tve vā na syuḥ tad viṣayāṇi te / tad vaśāt eka rūpāṇi na eka rūpam ca vastu tat // 	If they were dependent upon the speaker’s whim, then the cognitions would not envisage the things at all. under that whim, the cognitions should be of one form, and yet the thing is not of one form 
sthiti prasava saṃstyāna saṃśrayā liṅga saṃsthitiḥ / yadi syāt avibhāgena viliṅga tvam prasajyate // 	If the application of the genders were based upon the states of continuance, appearance and destruction,—then, all the three genders would become applicable to all things 
abhāvaḥ nirupākhya tvam tuccha tā iti yat ucyate / tatra sthiti ādi sambandhaḥ kaḥ asatsu parikalpyate // 	There are three words used (in connection with non-entities)—‘abhāvaḥ’ (masculine), ‘nirupākhyam’ (neuter) and ‘tucchatā’ (feminine); what sort of connection with the states of continuance, etc. could be assumed in regard to the nonentities (spoken of by these words)? 
utpādaḥ prasavaḥ ca eṣām nāśaḥ saṃstyānam iṣyate / ātma rūpam tu bhāvānām sthitiḥ iti abhidhīyate // tatra utpāde na nāśaḥ asti tat kim utpattiḥ ucyate / na ātma ākārā sthitiḥ ca asti tat katham janma gīyate // saṃstyāne na dvayam ca anyat tat katham vyapadiśyate  / tirobhāvaḥ ca nāśaḥ ca tirobhavanam iti api // sthitau sthitiḥ svabhāvaḥ ca hetunā kena vā ucyate 	Of things,—‘appearance’ is birth; ‘destruction’ is perishing; and ‘continuance’ is the thing in its own form. now in birth there is no perishing; why then is it spoken of as ‘utpattiḥ’ (feminine)? Nor is there existence in its own form; why then is it spoken of as ‘janma’ (neuter)? In destruction also, the other two states are not there; why then is it spoken of as ‘tirobhāvaḥ’ (masculine), ‘nāśaḥ’ (masculine) and ‘tirobhavanam’ (neuter)? As regards continuance also, on what ground is it spoken of as ‘sthitiḥ’ (feminine) and ‘svabhāvaḥ’ (masculine)?—If the form of these is not differentiated, then they should always be in one and the same gender 
go tva ādayaḥ iva ete api yadi strī tva ādayaḥ matāḥ / sāmānyasya nirāsena te apāstāḥ eva tādṛśāḥ // 	If the feminine and the rest be held to be so many different universals,—then all such should be regarded as discarded by the rejection of the ‘universal’ itself 
jātiḥ bhāvaḥ ca sāmānyam iti vā teṣu saṃmatam / na sāmānyāni yujyante sāmānyeṣu aparāṇi hi // 	Such words are applied to particular universals, as ‘jātiḥ’ (feminine), ‘bhāvaḥ’ (masculine) and ‘sāmānyam’ (neuter). nor is it possible for universals to subsist in other universals themselves 
abhāvaḥ nirupākhya tvam tuccha tā ityādi vā katham / sāmāyikī eva tena eṣā liṅga tritaya saṃsthitiḥ // 	How too can there be such words as ‘abhāvaḥ’ (masculine), ‘nirupākhyam’ (neuter) and ‘tucchatā’ (feminine)?—From all this it follows that the entire scheme of three genders is purely conventional 
saṅkhyā api sāmāyikā eva kalpyate hi vivakṣayā / bheda abheda viveke pi dāra ādi vipina ādi vat // 	Number also is purely conventional, and is assumed through the whim of the speaker, even when there is discrimination between difference and non-difference; as is found in the case of words like ‘dārā’ (wife), etc. and ‘vipina’ (forest), etc 
nanu vyaktau ca jātau ca dāra ādiḥ ced prayujyate / vyakteḥ avayavānām vā saṃkhyām ādāya vartate // vana śabdaḥ punar vyaktīḥ jāti saṅkhyā viśeṣitāḥ  / bahūḥ āha athavā jātim bahu vyakti samāśritām // 	If words like ‘dārāḥ’ are used in reference to the individual as well as the universal, it is so applicable on the basis of the number of either individuals or the components.—The word ‘vana’ denotes either individuals as qualified by the number of the universal, or the universal as subsisting in a plurality of individuals.”—[Ślokavārtika-Vanavāda 92-94] 
nanu ca etena vidhinā sarvam ekam vacaḥ hatam / na anyatra asti vivakṣā ced sā eva astu asya nibandhanam // 	In this way all words in the singular number become doomed.—If it be argued that “in the case of other words (in the singular number) the speaker’s wish does not lie that way”,—then that wish itself might be the basis in the cases in question also 
jāteḥ api na saṅkhyā asti bhāve vā tad viśeṣitāḥ / katham sambaddha sambandhāt yadi sambandhataḥ api vā // 	There can be no number in the universal at all.—Even if the number were there in the universal, how could the individuals be qualified by that number?—“[They could be so qualified] through the connection of what is connected (indirectly), or through direct connection itself”.—[If this be held then the answer would be as in the following text] 
yadi evam abhidhīyeta vanam ekaḥ api pādapaḥ / bahavaḥ api hi kathyante sambandhāt eva saḥ asti ca // 	If it be so, then even a single tree could be spoken of as ‘vana’ (forest); several trees also are spoken of as such only through connection, and that is present in the single tree also 
bahu vyakti āśritā yā ca sā eva ekasyām api sthitā  / tad nimittasya tulya tvāt tatra api vana dhīḥ bhavet // 	That (universal) which subsists in the many individual trees is the same that subsists in the single individual (tree),—the basis thereof being the same in both oases; consequently, the idea of ‘vana’ (forest) should be there in connection with the single tree also 
anvaya vyatirekābhyām eka ādi vacasaḥ tatas  / niyamaḥ ayam vivakṣātaḥ na arthāt tad vyabhicārataḥ // 	Thus the use of words in the singular and other numbers should be regarded through concomitance and non-concomitance, as depending entirely upon the speaker’s whim,—not upon the real state of things; as it is not always in accordance with this latter 
kriyā kāla ādi yogaḥ api pūrvam eva nirākṛtaḥ / tasmāt sāṅketikāḥ ete na vyaktiṣu api bhāvinaḥ // 	The connection of action, time, etc. has been already rejected before. Hence all these also are purely conventional, and do not really subsist in individuals also 
vyakti rūpa avasāyena yadi vā apohaḥ ucyate / tad liṅga ādi abhisambandhaḥ vyakti dvāraḥ asya vidyate // 	In fact, the Apoha is denoted as apprehended in the form of the individual; and the Apoha therefore is connected with gender, etc. through that individual 
abhiprete niveśa artham buddheḥ śabdaḥ prayujyate / an abhīṣṭa vyudāsaḥ atas sāmarthyena eva siddhyati // 	The word is used only for the purpose of bringing about the cognition of the thing intended; hence the ‘exclusion of what is not-intended’ becomes apprehended by implication 
sarvam eva na ca abhīṣṭam sarva artha aniyama āptitaḥ  / tat pacati ādi śabdānām vinivartyam parisphuṭam // 	All things cannot be desired; as, in that case, there would be no restriction regarding any denotations. Hence in the case of words like ‘cooks’ and the like, there is clearly ‘something excluded’ 
tathā hi pacati iti ukte na udāsīnaḥ avatiṣṭhate / bhuṅkte dīvyati vā na iti gamyate anya nivartanam // audāsīnyam atas ca evam asti anyat ca kriyā antaram / paryudāsa ātmaka apohyam niyatam yat yat iṣyate // 	When the verb ‘pacati’ (‘cooks’) is uttered, what is understood is that ‘he is not doing nothing,—nor is he eating or gambling’—where the ‘exclusion of other acts’ is clearly apprehended. Thus, whatever is intended (to be spoken), there is always something ‘excluded’ by the ‘relative negation’,—this something being ‘doing nothing’ and also other acts (than the one meant to be spoken of by the verb used) 
pacati iti aniṣiddham tu svarūpeṇa eva tiṣṭhati / iti etat ca bhavat vākyam paraspara parāhatam // anya rūpa niṣedhaḥ ayam svarūpeṇa eva tiṣṭhati / iti anyathā nirartham syāt prayuktam avadhāraṇam // 	Your assertion that “the cooking remains un-negatived in its own form” involves self-contradiction; because the words ‘in its own form’ can only mean that ‘there is negativing of the form of other acts’; otherwise the emphasising would be meaningless 
niṣpanna tvam apohasya nirupākhyasya kīdṛśam  / gagana indīvara ādīnām niṣpattiḥ nahi kācana // vastu iti adhyavasāyāt ced sa upākhyā tvena bhāti asau / tatas kim tulya dharma tvam vastubhiḥ ca asya gamyate // 	Apoha being featureless, what sort of ‘accomplishment’ could there be of it? Certainly there is no ‘accomplishment’ of the ‘sky-lotus’ etc.—If it be urged that “inasmuch as it is apprehended as a thing, it appears as with features”,—then (we ask) what if it is so?—[It may be said that] “From this it would follow that it has the same properties as entities.” 
sādhya tva pratyayaḥ tasmāt tathābhūta ādi rūpaṇam / vastubhiḥ tulya rūpa tvāt tad nimittam prasajyate // 	Thus then, the notion of ‘being accomplished’, as also the conception of the ‘past’ etc.,—being of the same form as positive entities—comes to be based upon that same 
vidhi ādau artharāśau ca nāstitā ādi niṣidhyate / sāmarthyāt na tu śabdena yat eva na vivakṣitam // 	In the case of all such denotations as the injunction and the like,—what is ‘excluded’ (negatived) is ‘non-existence’, etc.,—exactly that which is not meant to be spoken of; but this is done by implication,—not directly by the word 
nañaḥ ca api nañā yuktau apohaḥ tādṛśaḥ bhavet / tad catuṣṭaya sadbhāve yādṛśaḥ saṃpratīyate // nañā yoge nañaḥ hi arthaḥ gamyate kasyacid vidhiḥ  / tṛtīyena nañā tasya virahaḥ pratipādyate  // niṣedhāya aparaḥ tasya turīyaḥ yaḥ prayujyate  / tasmin vivakṣite tena jñāpyate anya nivartanam 	Of similar kind would be the Apoha, when a negative is joined with another negative; just as it is apprehended when there are four negatives. in some cases, when a negative is associated with another negative, what is apprehended from it is something positive; the third negative expresses the negation (absence) of that positive thing; and when for the negativing of that again a fourth negative is used, if that is meant to be spoken of, what is denoted by it is the ‘exclusion of another’ 
na asau na pacanīti ukte gamyate pacati iti hi / audāsīnya ādi yogaḥ ca tṛtīyena hi gamyate // turye tu tad viviktaḥ asau pacati iti avasīyate / tena atra vidhi vākyena samam anya nivartanam // 	When it is said ‘nāsau na pacati’ (‘it is not that he does not cook’) what is understood is that ‘he cooks’; if a third negative is added, what is understood is either that ‘he is doing nothing’ or that ‘he is doing something other than cooking’;—and when a fourth negative is added, what is understood is something differentiated from this last, that is, ‘he is cooking’. So that here the ‘exclusion of another’ is similar to that in the case of the affirmative sentence 
samuccaya ādiḥ yaḥ ca arthaḥ kaścid ca ādeḥ abhīpsitaḥ  / tad anyasya vikalpa ādeḥ bhavet tena vyapohanam // 	Of particles like ‘ca’ the meaning intended is something like ‘combination’; and thus there would be ‘exclusion’ by that, of things other than that, in the shape of ‘option’ and the like 
vākya arthe anya nivṛttiḥ ca su jñātā eva tathā hi asau / padārthāḥ eva sahitāḥ kecid vākya arthaḥ ucyate // teṣām ca ye vijātīyāḥ te apohyāḥ su parisphuṭāḥ  / vākya arthasya api te ca eva tebhyaḥ anyaḥ na eva saḥ asti hi // 	The exclusion of others’ is clearly understood in the case of the meaning of a sentence. it is only the denotations of certain words construed together that is spoken of as ‘the meaning of the sentence’; what would be ‘excluded’ by these words would clearly be the things different from those denoted by these words; so that the same would be ‘excluded’ by the meaning of the sentence also. Because the meaning of the sentence is nothing apart from the meanings of the words (composing it) 
yat tatra jaḍa cetobhiḥ āśaṅkā āspadam iṣyate / tat eva kṣipyate tena viphala uccāraṇā anyathā // kiñcid hi aśaṅkamānaḥ asau kimartham paripṛcchati / a tad saṃskārakam śabdam bruvan vā svastha dhīḥ katham // 	What is regarded by dull-witted persons as open to doubt is what is ‘excluded’ by the word in question; otherwise, the utterance of the word would be useless.—If he does not regard anything as open to doubt, then why does he ask (another person) about it?—If one utters a word that does not bring about embellishment (enlightenment),—how can he be regarded as a sane-minded person? 
cakṣuḥ jñāna ādi vijñeyam rūpa ādi iti yat ucyate / tena āropitam etat hi kenacid pratiṣidhyate // 	When it is asserted that ‘colour is cognisable by visual perception’—this certainly serves to ‘exclude’ (deny) something supposed by some person 
na cakṣuḥ āśritena eva rūpam nīla ādi vedyate / kintu śrotra āśritena api nityena ekena cetasā // 	The supposition is]—“It is not by the cognition through the eye alone that the blue and other colours are cognisable,—but also by the one eternal cognition, through the ear also.” 
prameya jñeya śabda ādeḥ pratiyatti nimitta tām  / ittham vākya sthitasya eva dṛṣṭvā kāla antareṣu api // kevalasya upalambhe yā pratītiḥ upajāyate  / plavamāna artha bhedeṣu sā tad vākya anusārataḥ // ghaṭa ādibhyaḥ api śabdebhyaḥ sā asti eva ca tathāvidhā  / tasmāt haṭa ādi dhvanayaḥ samāḥ // 	That words like ‘knowable’, ‘cognisable’ serve as the means of producing cognitions (ideas) having been perceived only when they appear in a sentence,—if, at some other time? They are found to be used alone by themselves, the idea that is produced by them, in regard to things that are nebulous, is in accordance with what has been found in the case of their use in a sentence.—In fact, in the case of words like ‘jar’ also, it is the same; so that the words ‘knowable’ and the like are just like the words ‘jar’ and the rest 
apohya kalpanāyām ca varam vastu eva kalpitam / iti etat vyāhatam proktam niyamena anya varjanāt // vastu eva kalpyate tatra yat eva hi vivakṣitam / kṣepaḥ vivakṣitasya atas na tu sarvam vivakṣitam // 	The statement that, “rather than assume the ‘excluded’ thing it is far better to assume the thing itself”, is self-contradictory; as in every case there is ‘exclusion of some other thing’, that thing alone is assumed which is meant to be spoken of; hence there is implication of that which is meant to be spoken of; but all things are not meant to be spoken of 
jñāna ākāra niṣedhaḥ tu sva vedya tvāt na śakyate / vidyate hi nirālambam āropakam anekadhā // jñānasya ātma gataḥ kaścid niyataḥ pratigocaram  / avaśya abhyupagantavyaḥ svabhāvaḥ ca saḥ eva ca // asmābhiḥ uktaḥ ākāraḥ pratibimbam tad ābha tā  / ullekhaḥ pratibhāsaḥ ca saṃjñā bhedaḥ tu akāraṇam // 	As for the denial of the idealistic form of things,—such denial is impossible because the fact is self-evident; as actually there are several impositions without any basic reality.—It has to be admitted that there must be something in the idea (or cognition) itself which appertains specifically to each object envisaged by it; and that is precisely its ‘nature’;—and this same ‘nature’ of the idea has been spoken of by us as ‘form ‘reflected image’, ‘appearance’, ‘figuring’, ‘manifestation so that there is only a difference in the name, without any real difference 
evam ityādi śabdānām na evam ityādi vidyate / apohyam iti vispaṣṭam prakāra antara lakṣaṇam // 	In the case of the word ‘evam’ (thus), there is ‘naivam’ (not thus) which is clearly ‘excluded’; in the sense of ‘in another manner’ 
vyavahāra upanīte ca sarva śabde api vidyate / vyudāsyam tasya ca arthaḥ ayam anya apohaḥ abhidhitsitaḥ // 	In the case of the word ‘all’ also, as presented in actual usage, there is something ‘excluded’; and what is regarded as meant to be spoken of here also is the ‘exclusion of others 
sarve dharmāḥ nirātmānaḥ sarve vā puruṣāḥ gatāḥ  / sāmastyam gamyate tatra kaścid aṃśaḥ tu apohyate // kecid eva nirātmānaḥ bāhyāḥ iṣṭāḥ ghaṭa ādayaḥ / gamanam kasyacid ca evam bhrāntiḥ tat vinivarttate // 	1186) There are such misconceptions as—‘only external things like, the jar are soulless’, ‘only some men can go’; and it is these that are ‘excluded’ 
sarva aṅga pratiṣedhaḥ ca na eva tasmin vivakṣitaḥ / sva artha apoha prasaṅgaḥ ayam tasmāt ajña tayā ucyate // 	In the case of the word ‘all’, the negation of all parts is not what is meant to be spoken of; hence the incongruity of the ‘exclusion of its own meaning’ that has been urged has been so under ignorance 
na bhāvaḥ na api ca abhāvaḥ apṛthak eka tva lakṣaṇaḥ  / na āśrita anāśritaḥ apohaḥ na eka anekaḥ ca vastutas // 	It is neither positive nor negative; it is neither diverse nor same; it is neither subsistent, nor non-subsistent; it is neither one nor many

bheda abheda ādayaḥ sarve vastu sat pariniṣṭhitāḥ / niḥsvabhāvaḥ ca śabda arthaḥ tasmāt ete nirāspadāḥ // 	Diversity’ (difference) and ‘sameness’ (non-difference), etc. are resident in entities; while the ‘denotation of words’ is entirely featureless; hence the said characters have no place here

As a matter of fact, this is not what is held to be ‘negatived’ by the word directly

Is it ‘denotability’ by the word ‘Apoha’? Or by the wobd ‘jar’ and the best?—As regards the question—whether the Apoha that is denoted is itself of the nature of Apoha (negation, exclusion) or it is something positive,—when we come to think of it, what is cognised is the apoha that figures in the cognition.—Our view is that what is denoted by the word directly is the reflected image,—and as regards ‘the negation of other things’, like the universal etc.,—That is comprehended only indirectly, through implication.—What all such words as ‘jar’, ‘tree’ and the like denote is the said reflected image, as it is the cognition of this that they produce directly; and anything else, they imply only indirectly.—Thus then, there is no incongruity regarding the positive character; nor is there anything undesirable for us.—As regards the alternative of Apoha not being ‘denotable’,—that we do not accept; and hence that is not our view 
eka tva nitya tā ādiḥ ca kalpitaḥ na tu tāttvikaḥ  / tat atra hāsa karaṇam mahāvidvat tva sūcakam // 	The ideas of ‘one-ness’, ‘eternality’ and the like are purely imaginary, not real. hence your laughter at us on this point is indicative of a very high grade of learning (on your part)! 
avadhāraṇa sāmarthyāt anya apohaḥ api gamyate / sva ātmā eva gamyate yatra viphalaḥ niyamaḥ amyathā // 	Even in cases where the thing itself is apprehended, the ‘exclusion of other things’ is also apprehended,—as is indicated by the force of the emphasising term (used by you); if it were not, then, the emphasising would be useless 
yasya tarhi na bāhyaḥ arthaḥ api anyathā vṛttaḥ iṣyate / vandhyā suta ādi śabdasya tena kva apohaḥ ucyate // 	In the case of such terms as ‘son of the barren woman—where there is no external object which would be the ‘contrary’ (excluded),—wherein would the Apoha subsist which is said to be denoted by it?” 
rūpa abhāvāt abhāvānām śabdāḥ jāti ādi vācakāḥ  / na āśaṅkyāḥ eva siddhāḥ te nirbhāsasya eva sūcakāḥ // 	As non-entities have no form, words appertaining to those cannot be even suspected of being denotative of the universal and such things. in fact, it has been fully established that they are only indicators of the reflection 
artha śūnya abhijalpa uttha vāsanā mātra nirmitam / pratibimbam yat ābhāti tat śabdaiḥ pratipādyate // 	What is expressed by words is only the reflection that appears, as created solely by impressions made by objectless (empty) conceptions 
tanmātra dyotakāḥ ca ime sākṣāt śabdāḥ sa saṃśayāḥ  / saṅketa savyapekṣa tvāt kalpita artha abhidhāna vat // 	The words in question are directly expressive of that (reflection) alone,—because they are dependent upon convention,—like words expressing imaginary things 
para upagata bheda ādi vidhāna pratipādakāḥ / na ca ete dhvanayaḥ tasmāt tadvat eva iti gamyatām // 	These words are not denotative of the ‘specific individuality’ and the rest, that have been assumed by others. Hence these should be understood to be like those just mentioned 
saṅketa asambhavaḥ hi atra bheda ādau sādhitaḥ purā / vaiphalyam ca na tad hetvoḥ sandigdha vyatireki tā // 	That there can be no convention in regard toé specific individuality’ and the rest has been already -proved before. hence the reasons adduced are neither ‘doubtful’ nor ‘concomitant with the contrary of the probandum

svasya svasya avabhāsasya vedane api sa varttate / bāhya artha adhyavasāye yat dvayoḥ api samaḥ yataḥ // 	Even though each person is cognisant of what appears to himself, yet there is something in the cognition of external things which is common to both persons 
timira upahata akṣaḥ hi yathā prāha śaśi dvayam / sva samāya tathā sarvā śābdī vyavahṛtiḥ matā // 	Just as the man whose eye has been attacked by a disorder says to another like himself that ‘there are two moons’,—so also is all verbal usage 
vyāpaka tvam ca tasya idam iṣṭam ādhyavasāyikam / mithyā avabhāsinaḥ hi ete pratyayāḥ śabda nirmitāḥ // 	The concomitance of the convention has been accepted only on the basis of the notions of men; in fact, all cognitions brought about by words are ultimately false

pratyakṣam kalpanā apoḍham abhrāntam abhilāpinī / pratītiḥ kalpanā klṛpti hetu tva ādi ātmikā na tu  // 	Sense-perception is free from conceptual content and not erroneous.—‘Conceptual content’ is idea associated with verbal expression; it is not [regarded as] the basis of verbal expression, etc 
śabda artha ghaṭana ayogyā vṛkṣaḥ ityādi rūpatas / yā vācām aprayoge api sā abhilāpā iva jāyate // 	As a matter of fact, the cognition that is capable of connecting the thing and the word always appears as associated with verbal expression (words),—even when the words-like ‘tree’ and the like—are not actually used 
atīta bhava nāma artha bhāvanā vāsanā anvayāt / sadyojātaḥ api yad yogāt iti karttavya tā paṭuḥ // 	Through the continuance of the impression left by the constant associating of the thing and its name during past lives,—even the new-born infant becomes capable of activity, by reason of the said conceptual content

tasyāḥ ca adhyavasāyena bhrāntā śabda arthayoḥ sthitiḥ / anya ayogāt asattve asyāḥ sādṛśī api ca sambhavet // 	The connection between words and things, due to conceptual content, is illusory; hence as it cannot be based upon anything else,—if there were no conceptual content, the said connection, even as it is, would not be possible 
jāti ādi yojana ayogyām api anye kalpanām viduḥ / sā jāti ādeḥ apāsta tvāt adṛṣṭeḥ ca na saṅga tā // 	Some people have regarded the conceptual content to be that which is capable of being connected with the universal and the rest;—that view cannot be right, as the universal, etc. have all been rejected, and they are never perceived 
jāti ādīnām adṛṣṭa tvāt tad yoga apratibhāsanāt / kṣīra udaka ādi vat ca arthe ghaṭanā ghaṭate katham // 	The universal and the rest being never perceived,—and their connection being never manifested,—how can their association with things be possible,—as between milk and water, etc.? 
heya upādeya viṣaya kathanāya dvaya uktitaḥ / para apara prasiddhā iyam kalpanā dvividhā uditā // 	Two kinds of conceptual content have been mentioned in the two assertions, in order to set forth the two views that have been held by persons belonging to our own party and by those belonging to other parties,—in order to show which is to be accepted and which to be rejected 
nāma ādi yojanā ca iyam sva nimittam anantaram / ākṣipya varttate yena tena na a prastuta abhidhā // 	This ‘connection with name, etc.’ remains there after having indicated its own immediate cause; hence the assertion is not irrelevant 
nāma jāti ādayaḥ sarve yojyante vā anayā iti sā / tathā uktā kalpanā proktā pratītiḥ abhilāpinī // 	Name, universal and all the rest are connected by the said conceptual content; hence what is spoken of (by Diṅnāga’s definition) is the same conceptual content which has been described as ‘the idea associated with verbal expression’ 
yat vā sva mata siddhā eva kevalā kalpanā uditā  / sarvatra nāmnā yuktaḥ arthaḥ ucyate iti yojanāt // 	Or, what has been spoken of (in the definition in question) is the same conceptual content that we have ourselves asserted;this interpretation) being based upon the fact that in all cases things are spoken of by their name (this being the meaning of the compound ‘nāmādiyojanā’) 
taiḥ tu karaṇa vibhaktyā sāphalyam anubhūyate / nāmnaḥ jāti ādibhiḥ sā iyam iti arthaḥ adhyavatiṣṭhate // 	It is through these that the instrumental ending becomes useful; so that the meaning comes to be that the conceptual content becomes connected with the name, through the instrumentality of the universal, etc 
nanu anya apoha vācya tvāt jāti śabdaḥ tu kevalaḥ / vivakṣā paratantra tvāt vivakṣā śabdaḥ eva vā // 	Inasmuch as the ‘exclusion (Apoha) of others’ is the only denotation of words, all words should be ‘common’ only. or, inasmuch as they are dependent upon the speaker’s whim, they should all be ‘proper’ only.” 
satyam loka anuvṛttyā idam uktam nyāya videdṛśam / iyān eva hi śabdaḥ asmin vyavahāra patham gataḥ // 	It is true that what the professor of the science of reasoning has said is in accordance with the popular idea of things; as it is only on these lines that verbal usage actually proceeds 
te tu jāti ādayaḥ na iha lokavat vayatirekiṇaḥ / iti etad pratipatti artham anye tu ityādi varṇitam // 	The said ‘universal’ and the rest are nothing different from what is known by these words among people:it was with a view to emphasise this fact, that the statement ‘others etc.’ has been made 
jāti ādi yojanām ye api kalpanām samupāśritāḥ  / taiḥ abhyupeyā niyatam pratītiḥ abhilāpinī  // anyathā yojana abhāvāt yuktayoḥ iva bhāvayoḥ / svātantryeṇa paricchedāt kalpanā na eva kalpyate  // evam vā vyavahāryam syāt sarvam viśvam idam tatas  / jāti ādi rūpa saṃsṛṣṭam vyavahāryam idam matam // jāti ādi yojanā śabda yojanā avyabhicāriṇī / evam ca ucyate iti etat phalavat jāyate vacaḥ // 	Even those who are wedded to the notion that conceptual content consists in ‘connection with the universal and the rest’, have to admit that it is ‘idea associated with words’.—Otherwise, just as the two connected things are non-existent, so their connection also would be non-existent,—all things being conceived severally each by itself; and there would be no need for postulating the ‘conceptual content and the result of this would be that there would be no usage in the world; because usage has been regarded as associated with the universal and the rest,—and association with the universal and the rest is inseparable from association with words. thus alone could the expression ‘spoken of’ used by the teacher be fruitful 
tasmāt samasta siddhānta saṃsthitānām pravādinām / avivādāt ayatnena sādhyā iyam kalpanā matā amayā // 	Thus ‘conceptual content’ is something that can be easily proved without effort, as there is no dispute regarding it among teachers who take their stand upon all true doctrines

evam nyāya mukha granthaḥ vyākhyātavyaḥ diśā anayā  / jñānam iti abhisambandhāt pratītiḥ tatra coditā // 	Thus in this way is the passage from the nyāyamukha to be explained, by mentioning the ‘cognition it is the ‘idea associated with words’ that has been indicated 
yat vā viśeṣaṇam bhedaḥ yena anya apoha kṛt śrutiḥ / jāti ādīnām vyavacchedam anena ca karoti ayam // 	Or, the term ‘viśeṣaṇa’ [‘qualifying adjunct’, as occurring in the passage quoted from the Nyāyamukha, on p. 372, bottom] may be taken as standing for ‘differentiation’, ‘exclusion—by virtue of which words bring about the ‘Apoha, exclusion, of others’; [it is called ‘differentiation’] because it does the differentiating (or excluding) of the universal, etc 
evam pratīta rūpā ca yat evam kalpanā matā  / tādātmya pratiṣedhaḥ ca pratyakṣasya upavarṇyate // tadā adhyakṣa ādi śabdena vācya tve api na bādhyate / kalpanā virahaḥ adhyakṣe na hi sā śabda vācya tā // anyathā rūpa gandha ādeḥ sa vikalpaka tā bhavet / atas na āspadam eva idam yat āhuḥ kudhiyaḥ pare // yadi pratyakṣa śabdena pratyakṣam abhidhīyate / katham tad kalpanā apoḍham ayuktam gamyate katham 	Conceptual content being held to be as actually understood and described above, it is the denial of the sameness of this with sense-perception that has been asserted; and this is not inconsistent with the fact of its being spoken of by such words as ‘adhyakṣa’ (‘pratyakṣa’) and the like. In sense-perception there is absence of conceptual content, but ‘conceptual content’ is not the same as ‘expressed by words otherwise, colour, odour and the rest would become determinate (as they are ‘expressed by words’).—Thus there is no room for what the dull-witted persons have urged.—If the word ‘sense-perception’ actually denotes sense-perception, then how can its being said to be ‘free from conceptual content’ be held to be improper? 
pratyakṣam kalpanā apoḍham vedyate ati parisphuṭam / anyatra āsakta manasā api akṣaiḥ nīla ādi vedanāt // 	That sense-perception is ‘free from conceptual content’ is recognised very clearly; since it is found that even when one has his mind attracted by something else, he has the perception of the blue colour and other things through his senses 
na asau eva vikalpaḥ hi tam artham pratipadyate / atīta ādi abhidhā tyāgāt tad nāma ghaṭana āptitaḥ // 	This same conceptual content does not apprehend the said object; because if it did, it would abandon the expressing of the ‘past’, etc. and there would be the incongruity of its being connected with the name of that object 
tadā tad nāma saṃsargī vikalpaḥ asti aparaḥ na ca / dṛśyasya apratisaṃvitteḥ aniṣṭeḥ ca dvayoḥ sakṛt // 	At the particular time, there is no other conceptual content which is associated with the name of that object; because there is no recognition of any such perceptible conceptual content, and the simultaneous presence of both cannot be desirable 
vikalpakam atas jñāna sahabhāvi anubhūyate / tasmāt indriya vijñānam akalpanam idam sphuṭam // 	As a matter of fact, what makes the cognition determinate appears along with the cognition itself; hence the cognition brought about by the senses is clearly non-determinate (free from conceptual content) 
krameṇa eva upajāyante vijñānāni iti ced matam / sakṛdbhāva abhimānaḥ tu śīghra vṛtteḥ alāta vat // 	If it be held that “cognitions appear in succession (never simultaneously), and the idea of simultaneous appearance is due to the quickness of the succession; as in the case of the whirling fire-brand”—[then the answer is as stated in the following text] 
na tadā abhimukhībhūta bhāvanām anuṣaṅgavān  / vikalpaḥ vidyate dṛśyaḥ iti eva uktam na॰ nā // 	What has been asserted is that there is no perceptible conceptual content which is associated with the name of the object before the man’s eyes 
bhrāntiḥ tad abhimānaḥ ca tat vyaktam ca nirantaram / tat eva ca artha vijñāna yaugapadyam atas sphuṭam // 	That the said idea (of the simultaneity or the other conceptual content and the cognition) [cannot] be wrong has just been made clear. and this same simultaneity between the object and the cognition is also quite clear for that same reason 
narttakī dṛṣṭi avasthā ādau akhilam vedyate sakṛt / bahubhiḥ vyavadhāne api bhrāntiḥ sā ca āśu vṛttitaḥ // latā tāla ādi buddhīnām atyartham laghu vartanam  / sakṛt bhava abhimānaḥ atas kim atra api na varttate // śuddhe ca mānase kalpe vyavasīyeta na kramaḥ  / alpā ca sarva buddhīnām āśu vṛttiḥ cira āsthiteḥ // atas sarvatra viṣaye na krama grahaṇam bhavet  / sakṛdgrahaṇa bhāsaḥ tu bhavet śabda ādi bodha vat 	In the state of things attending upon the watching of the dancing girl, the whole lot sensations is apprehended at one and the same time, even though there are many intervening factors. If this also were regarded as a mistake due to the quick succession in which the sensations appear,—then (the answer is that) there is still quicker succession in the case of cognitions produced by the two words ‘latā’ and ‘tāla’ when pronounced together; why then is there no idea of simultaneity in this case?—Then in a case where the operations of the mind alone are concerned, no succession should be perceived, because all cognitions (mental operations) occur in quick succession and do not stay for any length of time. So that in all these oases (of quick succession), no succession could be perceived. The notion of simultaneous cognition however would be there, just as in the case of perception of sound, etc. (in the case of the dancing girl) 
alāte api sakṛt bhrāntiḥ cakra ābhāsā pravarttate  / na dṛśām pratisandhānāt vispaṣṭam pratibhāsanāt  // tathā hi pratisandhānam smṛtyā eva kriyate na tu  / darśanena vyatītasya viṣayasya anavagrahāt // yaḥ ca asyāḥ viṣayaḥ na asau vinaṣṭa tvāt parisphuṭaḥ / tatas parisphuṭaḥ na ayam cakra ābhāsaḥ prasajyate // 	In the case of the whirling fire-brand, the illusion of simultaneity appears in the form of the circle; this notion of the circle is not due to the connecting of the various perceptions of the fire-brand as it is whirled round; because the (continuous) circular form is clearly perceived. In fact, the said connecting of the various perceptions could be done only by remembrance, not by direct perception; as no perception can apprehend what is past and gone.—The object also of the remembrance could not be very clear, as it has already disappeared; for this same reason, the appearance of the circle also could not be very clear (if it were due to the remembrance of the many cognitions) 
yat iva yasya yadi ca api asya bhāvasya yat rūpa sthiti kāraṇam  / na vidyate na tattvena sa vyavasthāpyate budhaiḥ // avidyamāna sāsnā ādiḥ yathā karkaḥ gavātmanā / viśeṣaṇa viśiṣṭa artha viśiṣṭa artham grahaṇam na ca vidyate  // sa vikalpaka bhāvasya sthiteḥ ākṣe nibandhanam  / vipakṣaḥ śābaleya ādiḥ anyathā atiprasajyate  // na ca aprasiddha tā hetoḥ jāti ādeḥ pratiṣedhataḥ 	Or again, when there is no basis for the existence of a thing in a certain form,—that thing in that form is not admitted as real, by the wise. For instance, the white horse is not admitted to be the cow because the dewlap and the other features of the cow are not present in the horse. In the case of sense-perception there is no reason for the presence of the determinate character (the character of being associated with conceptual content), which could bring about the apprehension of the thing along with its properties.—Spotted and other cows are instances to the contrary. If it were not so, it would lead to absurd contingencies.—The reason adduced cannot be said to be ‘unproven’ (or not-admitted); as the universal and other qualifying factors have all been rejected. Nor are the properties cognised as apart from those factors. Nor are there any such properties 
nām api vācakam na eva yat śabdasya sva lakṣaṇam / sva lakṣaṇasya vācya tva vācaka tve hi dūṣite // adhyāropitam eva atas vācya vācakam iṣyate / anāropitam artham ca pratyakṣam pratipadyate // sva lakṣaṇasya sadbhāve sadbhāvāt tad abhāvataḥ / vyavadhāna ādi bhāve ca tasya api vyatirekataḥ // 	The name also, which would be the ‘specific individuality’ of the word, can never be denotative; as the idea of the ‘specific individuality’ being the denotes or the denoted has been already rejected.—It is for this reason that the idea of the denoter and denoted has been regarded as something superimposed (upon things);—while what one apprehends by sense-perception is something which is not superimposed; because this perception is there only when the ‘specific individuality’ is there,—and it is not there when the specific individuality is not there—through the intervention of something else or some such reason 
aśakya samayaḥ hi ātmā nīla ādīnām ananya bhāj / teṣām atas ca saṃvittiḥ na abhijalpa anuṣaṅgiṇī // 	The nature of the blue and other things, being individually specific, is incapable of having any convention in regard to it; the perception of these things, therefore, cannot be associated with words 
nanu nāma ādikam mā abhūt tasya grāhyam viśeṣaṇam  / tathā api asiddha tā hetoḥ na eva vyāvartete yatas // artha antara vyavacchinna rūpeṇa agrahaṇam yadi / artha mātra grahaḥ vā syāt agrahaḥ vā ghaṭe yathā  // ghaṭa antara vyavacchinna rūpeṇa agrahaṇam yadi / ghaṭa mātra grahaḥ vā syāt agrahaḥ vā ghaṭasya vai // 	Name (universal) and the rest may not be the distinguishing properties perceived, in the object (op sense-perception);—even so, the reason put forward does not cease to be inadmissible; because if there is no apprehension of the thing as distinguished from other things, then, there would either be an apprehension of the thing by itself only, or no apprehension at all; as in the case of the jar,—if there is no apprehension of the jar as distinguished from other jars, then there is either apprehension of the jar by itself alone, or no apprehension of the jar at all.” 
grāhya antara vyavacchinnam bhāvena grāhi ced matam / sa vikalpaka vijñānam bhavet vṛkṣa ādi bodha vat // 	If perception is regarded as apprehending the thing as distinguished from other apprehensible things,—then this cognition would be conceptual (determinate), just like the cognition of the tree and other things.” 
viśeṣaḥ aspṛṣṭa sāmānyaḥ na ca kaścana vidyate / grahaṇe ced tat aspaṣṭam vibhāva tvāt na gṛhyate // 	There is no particular (or individual) without a touch of the universal. if this is not touched in the apprehension, then the particular, becoming devoid of being, cannot be apprehended.” 
viśiṣṭa viṣayaḥ bodhaḥ kalpanā na iti sāhasam / na viśeṣaṇa samvandhāt ṛte vaiśiṣṭya sambhavaḥ // 	The assertion that the cognition apprehends a qualified thing, and yet it is not conceptual implies great temerity indeed! certainly, no ‘qualification’ is possible except through connection with qualifications.” 
sajātīya vijātīya vyāvṛtta artha grahāt mataḥ / viśiṣṭa viṣayaḥ bodhaḥ na viśeṣaṇa saṅgateḥ // 	When the cognition is held to apprehend the qualified thing,—it is by reason of its apprehending the thing as differentiated from other homogeneous and heterogeneous things,—and not of the connection of qualifications 
bhedaḥ vaiśiṣṭyam uktam hi na viśeṣaṇa saṅgtiḥ  / bhinnam iti api tat vācā na anuviddham pratīyate // 	What is meant by ‘being qualified’ (distinguished) is ‘difference”—not the connection of qualifications. but the idea also that ‘this is different’ is not cognised as associated with words 
svabhāva apara niḥśeṣa padārtha vyatirekiṇi / gṛhīte sati tasmin tu vikalpaḥ jāyate tathā // 	It is only after the thing has been apprehended as the ‘negation of all things other than itself’,—that there appears the conceptual cognition in the said form 
viśeṣaṇa anavacchinnam paraiḥ sāmānyam iṣyate / nirvikalpaka vijñāna grāhyam tatra api atas samam // 	Other people regard.the universal as not distinguished by qualifications,—which universal they regard as apprehended by non-conceptual perception. what has been urged is applicable to that also 
viśeṣāt hi viśiṣṭam tat sāmānyam avagamyate / tad grāhakam atas prāptam vijñānam sa vikalpakam // 	The universal is recognised as ‘distinguished’ from the particular; hence the perception of it would have to be regarded (under the opponent’s contention) as conceptual 
nirviśeṣam gṛhītaḥ ced bhedaḥ sāmānyam ucyate / tatas viśeṣāt sāmānya viśiṣṭa tvam na yujyate // 	A thing is called ‘universal’ when it is apprehended without distinction; hence it is not right to regard the universal as something distinguished from the particular.” 
vaiṣamya sama bhāvena jñāyamānāḥ ime kila / prakalpayanti sāmānya viśeṣa sthitim ātmani // 	When these (particulars) are cognised as similar or dissimilar, they indicate the existence in themselves, of the character of the ‘universal’ or the ‘particular’.”

Even if their forms are envisaged, they are apprehended only as distinct from other particulars; so that their perception would be ‘conceptual’

a tad ātmakam eva idam vaiśiṣṭyam vastunaḥ api hi / na asat rūpam ca sāmānyam tat viśiṣṭam na te katham // tasmāt sva lakṣaṇe jñānam yat kiṃcid saṃpravarttate / vāc patha atīta viṣayam sarvam tat nirvikalpakam // 	As a matter of fact, in the case of the entity also, being ‘distinguished’ consists in not being that same; and as the universal is not the same as the non-entity, why can you not regard it as being ‘distinguished’ from the non-entity? From all this it follows that whatever cognition appears in regard to the ‘specific individuality’ of things appertains to what is beyond the range of words and is hence non-conceptual

jāti mātra grahe tu syāt ekāntena vibhinna tā / viśeṣaṇasya na etat ca paraiḥ iṣṭam yathā uditam // 	If the universal alone were apprehended, then the qualification (property) would be something- absolutely distinct; and this is not what is acceptable to the other party, as asserted (by himself) 
yadi hi ekāntataḥ bhinnam viśeṣyāt syāt viśeṣaṇam / sva anurūpām tadā buddhim viśeṣye janayet katham // 	If the qualification were absolutely distinct from the qualified, then how could it bring about in the qualified a cognition in keeping with itself?”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 142] 
sva sāmānya ātmanoḥ yuktam jñānam ca ekam na vedakam / sa vikalpa anyathā bhāve prāktana apara vid na hi // 	One and the same cognition cannot comprehend both the specific individuality and the universal; because, if such a cognition were ‘conceptual’, there could be no comprehension of the former,—on the other hand, if it were otherwise, there could be no comprehension of the latter 
ekāntena anya tā bhāvāt jāti ādi ādyena ced gatam / vijñāta artha adhigantṛ tvāt smārta jñāna samam param // 	On account of there being no absolute distinction (between the universal and the specific individuality),—if the universal and other properties have become already apprehended by the initial cognition,—then the subsequent cognition would be apprehending only what has been already apprehended,—and it would thus be like remembrance 
saṃmugdha aneka sāmānya rūpeṇa adhigame sati / na eva ced niścitam vastu niścayaḥ tu uttarottaraḥ // samāropa vyavaccheda viṣaya tvāt yathā anumā / samāropa vyavaccheda viṣayaḥ niścayaḥ tathā // 	At the initial stage), there is only a vague idea of several universals, and there is no definite idea of anything; the definite idea comes only later; as this apprehends the thing as differentiated from all impositions (doubts and misconceptions). Just as inference apprehends the object as differentiated from impositions, so also does the (later) definite cognition.”

What really happens is that after the sense-perception (of a certain thing) there appear certain impositions (doubts and misconceptions), and it is by reason of setting aside these impositions that inferential-cognition has been regarded as valid.—This is not possible for you; because in the case of such cognitions as ‘the white—cow—walking’—after the sense-perception, no imposition is found to appear, which could be negatived (by the subsequent valid cognition)

tat atra na virodhaḥ asti vikalpena saha anayoḥ / na ca api viṣayaḥ bhinnaḥ tad artha adhyavasāyataḥ // 	There is no incompatibility between the conceptual content and the said reasons; nor is there difference in their objects; as the object apprehended by the one is the same as that apprehended by the other

If it were purely mental, it should cease like the illusion regarding a serpent, even when the disorder of the sense-organ has not ceased; and yet it continues to be perceived quite clearly

If it be held that these notions do cease on the subsequent notion that ‘these are not found in the specific individuality of things’,—then the answer is that such cessation is possible also in the case of such illusions as that of ‘two moons’.—If it be urged that the existence of these does not cease—then, the same may be said in regard to the notions of the universal, etc, also—as regards the illusions regarding god and such other beings, appearing in persons who are bent upon believing in them, there is no cessation at all, even on listening to millions of reasons; in fact, these dull-witted persons declare that these reasons are no reasons at all.”

Because there is no intervention by any unmistaken (right) notion; as no such intervening right notion is ever apprehended.—Even when the man has his mind not turned to other things, he has the continuous perception of ‘two moons’; which shows that the production (of the illusion, by the sense-organ) is not indirect—as regards the ideas of ‘entity’, ‘universal’ and so forth,—where there is the possibility of their being retracted,—cessation is quite possible, if the person so wishes. So also in the case of the idea relating to god 
pīta śaṅkha ādi buddhīnām vibhrame api pramāṇa tām / artha kriyā avisaṃvādāt apare saṃpracakṣate // 	There are others who declare that—“notions like ‘the yellow conch-shell’, even though illusory, are valid,—inasmuch as they are not in con gruent with effective action.”

na varṇa vyatiriktam ca saṃsthānam upapadyate / bhāsamānasya varṇasya na ca saṃvādaḥ iṣyate // 	There can re no shape apart from the colour; and with the apparent colour, there is no compatibility (in the case in question)

mānasa indriya vijñāna nirvikalpa tva sādhane / yaḥ nyāyaḥ sa sukha ādīnām avikalpa tva sādhakaḥ // 	The reasoning that is used in proving the non-conceptual character of the cognitions produced by the mental sense-organ, also serves to prove the non-conceptual character of the sensations of pleasure, etc 
avedakāḥ parasya api sva vid bhājaḥ katham nu te / eka artha āśrita vijñāna vedyāḥ tu ete bhavanti ced // 	They (pleasure, etc.) are non-apprehensive of another thing; how then can they carry their own cognisance with them? In fact, they become cognisable only by the cognition which subsists in the same substratum as themselves”.—If this is urged—[then the answer is as in the following texts] 
nairantarya pravṛtte hi bāhya vastu upalambhate  / sukha ādi vedyate kasmāt tasmin kāle nirantaram  // mānasena eva yat vedyam iṣyate cetasā na ca  / tad kāle tasya sadbhāvaḥ krama janma upavarṇanāta  // janma eva yaugapadyena na iṣyate na punar sthitiḥ  / iti ced na sthitiḥ tasya kṣaṇa bhaṅga prasādhanāt  // āśu vṛtteḥ sakṛt bhrāntiḥ iti ced sā api apākṛtā  / vispaṣṭa pratibhāsaḥ hi na syāt smaraṇa gocare // sāta asāta āśāta āśāta ādi rūp 	As a matter of fact, pleasure, etc. are felt immediately after the perception of the external object; why is it that they are always felt at that same time?—It is regarded as cognised by mental perception; but this perception is not there at the time; as cognitions have been described as appearing in succession (not at the same time).—If it be urged that “it is only simultaneous birth of cognitions that is not admitted, not their simultaneous existence”,—then the answer is that there can be no (continued) existence of anything; as all things have been proved to be momentary.—If it be urged that “there is an illusion of simultaneity, due to the quick succession of the cognitions”,—this also has been rejected already.—If the pleasure, etc., were amenable only to remembrance, then the feeling could not be vivid (as it is).—If it be assumed that the said illusion is in the form of ‘agreeable’ and ‘disagreeable’,—then it comes to this that the existence of pleasure and pain rests in themselves (and they are thus self-cognised).—When the mystics cognise, by sense-perception, the pleasure, etc. of other persons,—then, on account of the similarity of experience, they would themselves be unhappy (at the unhappiness of other people). For you, the feeling of pain consists, not in the existence of the pain itself, but in the cognition of which that pain is the object; and that is another ‘chain’.—The same applies to the inference of another person’s pain also, as inference has been described (by others) as objective (with object), and not purely subjective (not touching objects) 
sukha ādi iti eva gamyante sukha duḥkha ādayaḥ na tu / jñānam iti eva gamyante tat na jñānam ghaṭa ādi vat // 	Says Śaṅkarasvāmin]—“Pleasure, etc. are apprehended only as ‘pleasure, etc.’; they are not apprehended as ‘cognition’; consequently like the jar, etc., they cannot be cognition” 
yadi evam samaya anya tve jñānam iti api no gatiḥ  / cetasi asti tatas prāptā tatra api ajñāna tā tadā // 	If difference is to be accepted on the basis of convention, then cognition itself may not be spoken of as ‘cognition’,—and on the basis of that, cognition would become non-cognition

As regards the mystic’s cognition, we are going to describe it, on the basis of spotless reasons, as arising out of the contemplation of things and being free from conceptual content and error 
viṣaya adhigatiḥ ca atra pramāṇa phalam iṣyate / sva vittiḥ vā pramāṇam tu sārūpyam yogya tā api vā // 	The cognition of the object is held to be the ‘fruit’ of the means of cognition,—when the ‘means of cognition’ consists in the ‘sameness of form’ (between the cognition and the cognised);—or apprehension of itself is the fruit, and the means, in this case, consists in ‘capability’ 
chedane svadira prāpte palāśe na chidā yathā  / tathā eva paraśoḥ loke chidayā na ekatā iti ced // 	Just as, when the cutting weapon strikes at the Khadira-tree, the resultant cut does not appear in the Palāśa-tree,—in the same way nowhere in the world is the (cutting) axe found to be the same as the cut itself”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 75) 
na vyavasthā āśraya tvena sādhya sādhana saṃsthitiḥ / nirākāre tu vijñāne sā saṃsthā na hi yujyate // 	The distinction of ‘cause and effect’ does not rest upon the substratum of that distinction; cognition being formless, the said distinction cannot be possible 
atas utprekṣitaḥ bhedaḥ vidyate dhanuḥ ādi vat / utpādya utpādaka tvena vyavasthā iyam tu na iṣyate // 	Thus then, the (commonly known) distinction (between the cognition as means and cognition as fruit) is purely imaginary,—as in the case of the bow. the distinction cannot be held to be based upon the relation of the producer and produced 
viśliṣyamāṇa sandhau ca darva ādau paraśu chidā / praviśan ucyate tena tatra eka tvam avasthitam // 	When the compact fibre of the wood is rent asunder by the cut of the axe, the axe is (popularly) called the ‘cut’ only when it enters into the fibre; and it is in this way that there is sameness (between the axe and the cut)

Hence if the cognition be held to be the ‘means then the ‘fruit’ must be something else.—It cannot be right to attribute the character of the ‘fruit’ to the self-recognition (by the cognition), as this is going to be refuted later on. Nor can it be right to assert that the ‘means’ consists in the form of the object (cognised); as in that case there would be a diversity of objectives”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 78-79],

tatra eka lakṣaṇaḥ hetuḥ dṛṣṭānta dvaya varjitaḥ / kathiñcid upalabhya tvāt bhāva abhāvau sat ātmakau // 	An example of the one-featured probans without corroborative instances, we have in the reasoning—‘positive and negative entities are essentially existent—because they are capable of being apprehended somehow’.” 
candra tvena apadiṣṭa tvāt na acandraḥ śaśa lāñchanaḥ / iti dvi lakṣaṇaḥ hetuḥ ayam ca aparaḥ ucyate // patat kīṭa kṛtā iyam me vedanā iti avasīyate / patat kīṭaka saṃsparśa pratilabdha udaya tvataḥ  // cakṣuḥ rūpa grahe kārye sadā atiśaya śaktimat  / tasmin vyāpāryamāṇa tvāt yadi vā tasya darśanāt // kathañcid asat ātmānaḥ yadi vā ātma ghaṭa ādayaḥ / kathañcid na upalabhya tvāt khara sambandhi śṛṅga vat // kathañcana sadā ātmā 	the śaśa-lāñcana (hare-marked) is not non-moon.—Because it is spoken of as the moon’;—here we have a ‘two-featured’ probans 2) Another is thus stated ‘i think that this pain of mine has been caused by the falling insect,—because its appearance was felt on the touch of the falling insect’, ‘in bringing about the effect in the shape of the perception of colour, the eye is endowed with a unique potency,—because it is used for that purpose,—or, because colour is found to be actually perceived by its means ‘the soul, the jar and other things are somehow essentially non-existent,—because they are somehow inapprehensible in any way, like the horns of the hare’ 5) ‘Even the hare’s horn and such things are somehow existent,—because they are somehow apprehensible,—just like the soul, the jar and such things’ 
tat idam lakṣaṇam hetoḥ kim sāmānyena gamyate / jijñāsita viśeṣe vā dharmiṇi atha nidarśane // 	Is the proposed definition meant to be general? Or, in reference to a particular subject on which knowledge is sought? Or in reference to the instance? 
sāmānyena gate tasmin evam ced sādhya dharmiṇi / hetoḥ sattvam prakāśyeta na vivakṣita siddhi bhāj // 	If it were understood to be general, then, what would be indicated would be the existence of the probans in the object where the probandum is present; and it would not accomplish what is sought to be accomplished 
tat yathā cākṣuṣa tvasya nāśena avyabhicāri tā  / sāmānyena gatā tat ca dhvanau tasya na sādhanam // tasya dharmiṇi sadbhāvaḥ khyāpyate ced tathā sati / sā eva trirūpa tā āyātā bhavatām api darśane // 	For instance, ‘visibility’ is known to be inseparable (not existing apart) from ‘destruction’, in a general way; and yet it (visibility) cannot prove it (destruction) in sound.—If, then, it be said that its presence in the object is meant,—then, in that case, under your view also, the probans becomes ‘three-featured’ as before 
anyathā anupapattyā dihi vyatireka anvayau gatau / tasya dharmiṇi sadbhāvāt pakṣa dharma tva saṃśrayaḥ // 	Being otherwise impossible’ includes positive and negative: concomitance; and by its presence in the object its presence in the minor term becomes admitted 
ācāryaiḥ api nirddiṣṭam īdṛś saṃkṣepa lakṣaṇam / grāhya dharmaḥ tad aṃśena vyāptaḥ hetuḥ iti īdṛśam // 	A similar abbreviated definition has been indicated by our teacher also: who says that ‘the probans exists in the cognisable object and is pervaded by a part of it’ 
atha idam lakṣaṇam hetoḥ dharmiṇi eva avagamyate / yatas pramāṇāt na asiddhiḥ sādhyasya api tatas na tu  // sādhyasya apratipattau hi hetoḥ api na niścayaḥ  / atas nirarthakaḥ hetuḥ anyatas sādhya siddhitaḥ // anyonya āśraya doṣaḥ ca hetoḥ sādhyasya niścaye / dvayoḥ anyarā siddhau anyasya api aviniścaye // 	If the proposed definition of the probans is meant to be one that is found in the minor term only,—then that same means of cognition which has made the probans known would make known the probandum also. If the probandum does not become known, then the probans also cannot become known. Thus the probans would be useless, the probandum having become known by other means.—There would be the incongruity of ‘mutual interdependence’ also, if the definite cognition of the probandum followed from the probans; and between these two, the cognition of one would be dependent upon the cognition of the other 
nidarśane api tad siddhau na syāt dharmiṇi sādhya dhīḥ / na hi sarva upasaṃhārāt tasya vyāptiḥ viniścitā // 	Even if the probans were known as existent in the corroborative instance, that would not bring about the cognition of the probandum in the minor term. because its invariable concomitance will not have been definitely cognised all over 
yaḥ api ayam hetuḥ atra uktaḥ kathañcid upalambhataḥ / iti na asti eva viṣayaḥ sandigdhaḥ asya iti niṣphalaḥ // 	As regards the probans that has been but forward (under 1371), in the, form ‘because it is apprehended somehow’,—the object of this is not open to uncertainty; hence it is useless 
bhāvasya hi tad ātma tvam sarvaiḥ eva viniścitam / kathaṃcid tasya sādhya tvam kim ittham abhidhīyate // 	That the positive entity is essentially existent is known to all persons; then how is it said that it is known ‘somehow’? 
sarva bhāva aikya vāde api vikāra ātma ādi bhedataḥ / kenacid viśada ātma tvam ātmanā saṃprakāśyate // sarva bhāva gatam ye api niḥsvabhāva tvam āśritāḥ / te api tattvataḥ ityādi viśeṣaṇam upāśritāḥ // 	Even under the doctrine that “all things are one”,—on account of the diversity in the nature of the modifications, what is manifested is always in some definitely clear form. Even those who regard all things as ‘featureless’ (devoid of character), always have recourse to such qualifying terms as ‘truly’ and the like 
kathaṃcid upalabhya tvam anyathā nahi sidhyati / vyavahārasya sādhya tve prasiddham syāt nidarśanam // 	Otherwise, it cannot be admitted that ‘it is somehow apprehended’.—If it is usage that is sought to be proved,—then something well known should form the corroborative instance 
candra tvena apadiṣṭa tvam sapakṣe api anuvarttate / kvacid māṇavake yat vā karpūra rajata ādike // 	As regards ‘being spoken of as the moon this is present also in things where the probandum is known to be present;—or it is also sometimes present in the man (who is spoken of as the moon), or in camphor, silver and such other things (which are also called ‘moon’) 
candra tva sādhane hetau asādhāraṇa tā bhavet / prasiddhi vyatireke ca vastu rūpa samāśraye // 	There would be ‘uniqueness’ only if the probans were meant to prove ‘moon-ness’; as, in the absence of any well-known fact regarding it, it would be based entirely upon the nature of the thing itself 
patat kīṭa kṛta tvasya na viśeṣaḥ samīkṣyate / patat kīṭaka saṃsparśa pratilabdha udayasya ca // 	There is no distinction perceived between ‘being brought about by the falling insect’ and ‘having its appearance felt on the touch of the falling insect’ Falling’ must be made a qualification in the probans; otherwise ‘inconclusiveness’ (falsity) would be inevitable 
patataḥ asya iti kāryam hi dhruvam hetoḥ viśeṣaṇam / anyathā vyabhicāri tvam durnivāram prasajyate // kārya tā vyavahāraḥ tu tasya vismaraṇe sati / yadi sādhyaḥ trirūpaḥ syāt pūrva siddha nidarśanāt // 	1398) If what is meant to be proved (asserted in the conclusion) is that between the two (the pain and the insect) there is the relation of cause and effect,—which has been forgotten,—then the probans would be ‘three-featured’, as there would be a corroborative instance provided by previous experience 
cakṣuṣaḥ dharmi rūpasya sattā tāvat aniścitā  / tasyāḥ ca sādhanam yuktam na asiddhi ādi prasaṅgataḥ // 	As a matter of fact, the very existence of the eye,—which is the subject—is still uncertain; and the proving of this (existence) cannot be right,—as it would be open to the defects of ‘inadmissibility’ and the rest 
kintu rūpa ādi bhāve api cakṣuḥ jñānam na jāyate / kadācid tena tanmātram na hetuḥ iti gamyate // 	But sometimes, even though colour and other things are there, visual perception does not take place; hence it is understood that that (perception) alone cannot be a reason (for the existence of the eye) 
sva hetu niyata udbhūtiḥ aṅkura ādiḥ ca vidyate / tasmin dṛṣṭānte evam ca vailakṣaṇyam ati sphuṭam // 	The sprout is actually found to exist as having its birth inseparably connected with its cause; and this is always available as the corroborative instance; the instance per dissimilarity is too clear (to be stated) 
kathaṃcid asat ātma tva sādhane ca ghaṭa ādiṣu / pūrvavat hetu vaiphalyam aprasiddhiḥ ca dṛśyate // 	In proving that the jar and other things are “somehow nonexistent”,—the probans is found as, in a previous case, to be ‘futile’ and also ‘inadmissible’ 
asti ca atra api vispaṣṭam vaidharmyeṇa nidarśanam / tat eva teṣām svam rūpam prayāti hi vipakṣa tām // kathaṃcana sadātma tva sādhane pi nirātmasu / iṣṭa siddhiḥ asiddhiḥ ca vaidharma āptiḥ tathā eva ca // 	Here also, there is a clear corroborative instance per dissimilarity; that same form of the things becomes the thing where the probandum is known to be absent,—in the proving of the character of ‘being somehow existent’ in regard to non-entities,—there would be ‘proving of what is already admitted’; also ‘inadmissibility’, and the concomitance of the contrary character in that way 
pitṛ śabda śruteḥ yā api veśmanaḥ pratipādyate / pitṛ saṃbandhi tā tatra vyaktaḥ hetuḥ tri lakṣaṇaḥ // kvacid vipratisaṃbaddhaḥ svaraḥ prāk upalakṣitaḥ / tasya ananubhave pūrvam durddharā hetu asiddha tā // 	When the presence of the father in the house is sought to be proved by the hearing of the father’s voice,—the probans in this case is clearly ‘three-featured’. As, surely, at some time previously the concomitance of the voice has been perceived; if it has never been so perceived, then the ‘inadmissibility’ of the probans would be irresistible 
yasmin prāk upalabdhaḥ ca na upalabdhaḥ ca yatra saḥ / anvayaḥ vyatirekaḥ vā vispaṣṭam tatra dṛśyate // śabdaḥ tu jñāpayati artham na eva bāhyam kathaṃcana / anyathā asambhava abhāvāt vilakṣa āgamakaḥ tu asau // tasyām ca pratipādyāyām vailakṣaṇyam ati sphuṭam  / vivakṣā saṃmukhībhāve na hi śabdaḥ prayujyate  // dīpaḥ tu jñāpakaḥ na eva nīla ādeḥ liṅga bhāvataḥ  / jñāna utpādana yogyasya jananāt tu tathā ucyate 	In that house wherein the father had been found before,—and also in that wherein he had not been found before,—there is the concomitance, positive and negative, clearly perceived,—as regards the word, it does not make known any external object at all; because in this case, the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’ is not present; the word can only be the indicator of the ‘speaker’s wish’ (to speak of a certain thing). If this (speaker’s wish) were meant to be what is expressed by the word, then its difference is quite clear. Because when the ‘speaker’s wish’ is not there, the word cannot be used.—As regards the lamp, it does not make the blue and other things known by becoming the indicative (inferential); all that it does is to make things capable of being cognised; and it is only in this sense that it is called a ‘means of cognition only in case the word were an inferential indicative, would it be necessary to consider if it fulfils the conditions of being present in the subject (minor term.) and so forth. Otherwise, why cannot the same be urged in connection with the eye and other organs (as means of cognition)?—Even through the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’, visibility cannot prove anything, unless it is present in the subject (minor term).—Thus ‘one-featured’ probans are all impotent.—In those that have been cited as ‘one-featured’ probans, the presence of two features becomes clearly indicated; and in those that have been cited as ‘two-featured’, the presence of three features becomes clearly indicated; because every probans must reside in the subject (which therefore is an additional condition that must be fulfilled).—If it be argued that “this feature is implied by the character of being otherwise impossible”,—that cannot be so; because in the case of sound, though visibility may be otherwise desired, it is not present in sound (which is the subject) 
tad putra tva ādi hetūnām sandigdha vyatirekataḥ / na trailakṣaṇya sadbhāvaḥ vijātīya avirodhataḥ // 	In the case of such probans as ‘because he is the son of so and so’, the contrary being open to doubt, the three conditions are not present; because what is cited is not incompatible with the contrary
