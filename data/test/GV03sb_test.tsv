tā vā etāḥ / nava vyāhṛtayo bhavanti naveme puruṣe prāṇā etānevāsminnetaddadhāti tasmānnava vyāhṛtayo bhavanti //	These same (preceding formulas) are nine utterances; for nine, in number, are those breaths (or vital airs) in man , and these he thereby puts into him (the sacrificer): for this reason there are nine utterances.

It replied, 'So be it!' and returned to the gods; and with what had thus returned to them, the gods worshipped; and by worshipping with it they became the gods they now are.

They hand it down by means of speech, for the sacrifice is speech (prayer), and speech is seed: therefore they keep up the tradition by means of it.

The Adhvaryu utters his call: thereby the sacrifice passes on to the Âgnîdhra.

The Adhvaryu must utter nothing improper until he pronounces (the word) 'yaga (recite the offering-prayer):' in saying 'yaga the Adhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Hotri.

So now at the havis-sacrifice.

And where the officiating priests thus practice sacrifice with a perfect mutual understanding between them, there everything works regularly and no hitch occurs: therefore it is in this way that the sacrifice must be nursed.
tā vā etāḥ /	Now there are here five utterances, viz.

'Yea, may he (or, one) hear!' 'Pronounce the prayer to the kindling-sticks!' 'We who pronounce the prayer . . .' 'May he bear (the sacrifice to the gods) !' fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, five are the seasons of the year: this is the one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.
tāsāṃ saptadaśākṣarāṇi / saptadaśo vai prajāpatiḥ prajāpatiryajña eṣaikā yajñasya mātraiṣā sampat //	These (five formulas) consist of seventeen syllables;--seventeenfold, indeed, is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the sacrifice: this is the one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.

(they sent forth) the lightning; with' Ye yagâmahe (we who pray),' the thunder; with the vashat-call they caused it to rain .

o śrāvayeti vai devāḥ /	With 'O srâvaya!' the gods called the shining one (virâg, viz.

The shining one, doubtless, is this (earth), and of her this is the milking: and for him who knows this to be the milking of the shining one, this shining (earth-cow) thus milks out all his desires.
ṛtavo ha vai prayājāḥ / tasmātpañca bhavanti pañca hyṛtavaḥ //	The fore-offerings (prayâga), assuredly, are the seasons: hence there are five of them, for there are five seasons.

'Ours it (he) shall be!' they said.
tato devāḥ /	Then the gods went on praising and toiling.

By means of them they gained (pra-gi) the seasons, the year; they deprived their rivals of the seasons, of the year: hence (the fore-offerings are) victories (pragaya), for, assuredly, pragaya is the very same term as prayâga (fore-offering) . And in the same way this one (the sacrificer) wins by means of them the seasons, the year; deprives his rivals of the seasons, of the year. This is the reason why he performs the fore-offerings.
te vā ājyahaviṣo bhavanti /	The sacrificial food at these offerings consists ofclarified butter.

And with that thunderbolt, the butter, he now, in the same way, gains the seasons, the year, and deprives his enemies of the seasons, of the year.
etadvai saṃvatsarasya svam payaḥ /	For this reason clarified butter forms the sacrificial food at these (offerings).

This is the reason why clarified butter forms the sacrificial food at these (fore-offerings).

tadu tathā na kuryāt / yatraiva tiṣṭhanprayājebhya āśrāvayettata eva nāpakrāmedyatro eva samiddhatamam manyeta tadāhutīrjuhuyātsamiddhahomena hyeva samṛddhā āhutayaḥ //	This, however, he should not do; he should not move from that same spot where he may be standing when he calls for the fore-offerings. Lethim rather offer the (five) oblations in that part (of the fire) where he thinks there is the fiercest blaze; for only by being offered in blazing (fire), oblations are successful.
sa āśrāvyāha /	He (the Adhvaryu), having called (on, and having been responded to by, the Âgnîdhra), says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer (yâgyâ) to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks)!' Thereby he kindles the spring; the spring, when kindled, kindles the other seasons; the seasons, when kindled, generate the creatures and ripen the plants.

For were he to say, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât!' 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Ids!' and so on, he would commit (the fault of) repetition: hence he introduces the remaining (seasons or fore-offerings) by merely saying each time, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer !' He (the Hotri) now pronounces the offering-prayer (yâgyâ) to the Samidhs.
sa vai samidho yajati /	The samidh (kindler), doubtless, is the spring.

The gods, at that time, appropriated the summer, and deprived their rivals of the summer; and now this one also appropriates the summer, and deprives his rivals of the summer: this is the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât.
atheḍo yajati /	He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Ids.

The gods, at that time, appropriated the rains, and deprived their rivals of the rains; and now this one also appropriates the rains, and deprives his rivals of the rains: this is the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer to the Ids.
atha barhiryajati /	He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Barhis (covering of sacrificial grass on the altar).

The gods, at that time, appropriated the autumn, and deprived their rivals of the autumn;and now this one also appropriates the autumn, and deprives his rivals of the autumn: this is why he pronounces the prayer to the barhis.

Svâhâ !' The Svâhâ-call, namely, marks the end of the sacrifice, and the end of the year is the winter, since the winter is on the other (remoter) side of the spring. By the end (of the sacrifice) the gods, at that time, appropriated the end (of the year); by the end they deprived their rivals of the end; and by the end this one also now appropriates the end; by the end he deprives his rivals of the end: this is why he pronounces the offering-prayers with 'Svâhâ! Svâhâ!'
vasanta eva hemantātpunarasuretasmāddhyeṣa punrbhavati punarha vā asmiṃloke bhavati ya evametadveda //	Now the spring, assuredly, comes into life again out of the winter, for out of the one the other is born again: therefore he who knows this, is indeed born again in this world.

By 'may they accept!' doubtless, females (are implied); and by 'may he accept!' a male (is implied): thereby a productive union is effected, and for this reason he prays (alternately) with 'may they accept!' and 'may he (or it) accept!'
atha caturthe prayāje samānayati barhiṣi /	Now at the fourth fore-offering, to the barhis, he pours (butter) together (into the guhû ).

This is the reason why he pours (butter) together at the fourth fore-offering, that to the barhis.
sa vā anavamṛśantsamānayati /	He pours (the butter) together without (the two spoons) touching (each other).
sa yaddhāvamṛṣedyajamānaṃ dviṣatā bhrātṛvyenāvamṛśedattāramādyenāvamṛśettasmādanavamṛśantsamānayati //	If he were to touch (the one spoon with the other) he would touch the sacrificer with his spiteful enemy, he would touch the consumer with the one to be consumed: for this reason he pours (the butter) together without touching.

With 'Svâhâ Agni!' they established the butter-portion for Agni; with 'Svâhâ Soma!' they established the butter-portion for Soma; and with (the second) 'Svâhâ Agni!' they established that indispensable sacrificial cake which there is on both occasions (i.e. at the new- and full-moon sacrifices).

With the formula 'May Agni graciously accept of the butter!' they established Agni as Svishtakrit ('maker of good offering'), for Agni is indeed the maker of good offering. And till this day that sacrifice stands as firm as the gods established it. This is the reason why at the last fore-offering he prays with Svâhâ! Svâhâ!' according to the number of oblations (there are at the chief sacrifice). After he (the sacrificer) has won his battle, he establishes the entire sacrifice on a firm basis, so that, if after this he should violate the proper order of the sacrifice, he need not heed it; for he will know that his sacrifice is firmly established.

Hence after offering the last fore-offering, he sprinkles the havis one after another, and thereby replenishes them and again renders them efficient, because the butter is indeed efficient . Hence also from whatever sacrificialfood he (afterwards at the principal oblations) cuts off (a portion for a deity), that he again sprinkles (with butter), that he replenishes and renders efficient for the (Svishtakrit) maker of good offering. But when he cuts off the portion for the maker of good offering, then he does not again sprinkle (the sacrificial food out of which the portion has been cut), since after that he will not make any other oblation in the fire from the sacrificial food .
sa vai samidho yajati /	He (accordingly) pronounces the offering-prayer to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks).

If he be hot, then one may feel confident, for then he is kindled; and if he be cold, then one need hope no longer. Thus he thereby puts the breaths into him: this is the reason why he pronounces the prayer to the Samidhs.
atha tanūnapātaṃ yajati /	He then pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât.
reto vai tanūnapādreta evaitatsiñcati tasmāttanūnapātaṃ yajati //	Tanûnapât, doubtless, is seed; hence he thereby casts seed: this is why he pronounces the prayer to Tanûnapât.
atheḍo yajati /	He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Ids.
prajā ghā iḍo yadā vai retaḥ siktaṃ prajāyate 'tha tadīḍitamivānnamicamānaṃ carati tatpraivaitajjanayati tasmādiḍo yajati //	The Ids, doubtless, are offspring; when the seed thus cast springs into life, then it moves about in quest of food, as it were, praising (îd). Hence he thereby makes him (the sacrificer) propagate offspring: this is the reason why he, pronounces the prayer to the Ids.
atha barhiryajati /	He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Barhis.
bhūmā vai barhirbhūmānamevaitatprajanayati tasmādbarhiryajati //	The barhis, doubtless, means abundance, hence he thereby produces an abundance: this is why he pronounces the prayer to the barhis.

Svâhâ!' The Svâhâ-call, indeed, is what the winter is among the seasons; for the winter subjects these creatures to its will: hence in winter the plants wither, and the leaves fall off the trees; the birds retire more and more, and fly lower and lower; and the wicked man has his hair, as it were, falling off ; for the winter subjects these creatures to its will. And, verily, he who knows this, makes that locality wherein he lives, his own, for his own happiness and supply of food.
devāśca vā asurāśca /	The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were once contending for superiority.

Neither of them having gained the victory, they (the Asuras) said, 'Well then, let us try to overcome one another by speech, by sacred writ (brahman)! He who cannot follow up our uttered speech by (making up) a pair, shall be defeated and lose everything, and the other partyshall win everything!' The gods replied, 'So be it!' The gods said to Indra, 'Speak thou!'

dvau mametīndro 'bravīt / athāsmākaṃ dve itītare 'bruvaṃstadu tanmithunamevāvindanmithunaṃhi dvau ca dve ca //	Indra said, 'Two (dvau, m., duo) for me!' The others then said, 'Two (dve, f., duae) for us!' and thus found that pair, for dvau (duo) and dve (duae) make a pair.
trayo mametīndro 'bravīt / athāsmākaṃ tisra itītare 'bruvaṃstadu tanmithunamevāvindanmithunaṃ hi trayaśca tisraśca //	Indra said, 'Three (trayah, m.) for me!' The others then said, 'Three (tisrah, f.) for us!' and thus found that pair, for trayah. and tisrah make a pair.
catvāro mametīndro 'bravīt / athāsmākaṃ catasra itītare 'bruvaṃstadu tanmithunamevāvindanmithunaṃ hi catvāraśca catasraśca //	Indra said, 'Four (katvârah, m.) for me!' The others then said, 'Four (katasrah, f.) for us!' and thus found that pair, for katvârah and katasrah make a pair.

Then the others found no pair, for after that (numeral four) there is no pair, for then both (masculine and feminine) are pañka. Thereupon the Asuras were defeated and lost everything, and the gods won everything from the Asuras, and stripped their rivals, the Asuras, of everything.
tasmātprathame prayāja iṣṭe brūyāt / eko mametyekā tasya yamahaṃ dveṣmīti yadyu na dviṣyādyo 'smāndveṣṭi yaṃ ca vayaṃ dviṣma iti brūyāt //	For this reason let him (the sacrificer) say , when the first fore-offering has been performed, 'One (eka) for me!' and 'One (ekâ) for him whomwe hate!' And if he should not hate any one, let him say, 'who hates us and whom we hate!'
dve tasya yo 'smāndveṣṭi yaṃ ca vayaṃ dviṣma iti //	With the second fore-offering, 'Two (dvau) for me!' and 'Two (dve) for him who hates us and whom we hate!'

For, there being 'five' to five,' he (the enemy) is defeated, and whoever knows this, appropriates to himself everything that belongs to that (enemy of his), strips his enemies of everything.

Do not exclude us from the sacrifice! Let us have a share in the sacrifice!'
tadvai devā na jajñuḥ /	The gods, however, did not approve of this.

tadvai devānāmāga āsa /	This now caused anxiety to the gods: 'That owing to that (desertion of the Seasons), enemy[paragraph continues] (viz.

'We will not remove you from your place!' said they. And since, in inviting the Seasons, they did not remove Agni from his place, for that reason Agni is immutable ; and verily, he who knows that Agni to be immutable, does not move from the place where he bides.

Agni went to them and said, 'O Seasons, I have obtained for you a share in the sacrifice among the gods.' They said, 'In what form hast thou obtained it for us?' He replied, 'They will offer prayer to you first at the sacrifice.'

'The Ids, O Agni . . .!' 'The Barhis, O Agni. . .!' 'Svâhâ Agni!' And verily, whosoever knows that Agni is thus allowed to share (in the sacrifice) along with the Seasons, he is allowed to participate in whatever auspicious rite is performed by one who professes to be equal (in that knowledge) to him;--for him, being possessed of Agni, the Seasons, themselves possessed of Agni, ripen the plants and everything here.

They placed Agni at their head, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas; they placed Agni in their midst, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas; they placed Agni in their rear, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas.

If any one were to imprecate evil on him in the middle of the sacrifice, let him be thus spoken to, 'Thou shalt be without offspring, without cattle!' for offspring and cattle, indeed, constitute the centre (i.e.
yadyantato yajñasyānuvyāharet / tam prati brūyādapratiṣṭhito daridraḥ kṣipre 'muṃ lokameṣyasīti tathā haiva syāttasmāduha nānuvyāhārīva syāduta hyevaṃvitparo bhavati //	If any one were to imprecate evil on him after the completion of the (chief) sacrifice, let him be thus spoken to, 'Unstable and poor, thou shalt swiftly go to yonder world!' for thus it would indeed fare with him. One should not therefore utter imprecations: for whosoever thus understands this has the advantage.

Even as those (fore-offerings) are (the doors) of this (sacrifice), so is the spring a door, and so is the winter a door, of that (year). This same year he enters, as the world of heaven; for, assuredly, the year is all, and the All (universe) is imperishable: his thereby becomes imperishable merit, the imperishable world.

Let him reply, 'To Pragâpati;'for, assuredly, Pragâpati is undefined (mysterious); and undefined are the butter-portions, because they have the sacrificer for their deity; for the sacrificer is Pragâpati at his own sacrifice, since it is by his order that the priests spread and produce it.

They then sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and effaced the traces of it with the (sacrificial) post , theyconcealed themselves: and because they effaced (ayopayan, viz. the sacrifice) with it, therefore it is called yûpa (sacrificial post). Now this was heard by the Rishis:
yajñena ha vai devāḥ /	'Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained this conquest.

Now whether it be that the gods caused it (the sacrifice) to attract (or, peep forth to) them, or whether they took to it of their own accord, they said, 'Come, let us go to the place whence the gods obtained possession of the world of heaven!' They went about saying (to one another), 'What attracts? What attracts ?' and came upon the sacrificial cake which had become a tortoise and was creeping about.

Having then enveloped it in fire (Agni), knowing, as they did, that it had stopped for Agni, they Offered it up entirely, for it was an oblation to the gods. Then the sacrifice pleased them ; they produced it, they spread it. And this same sacrifice is taught by the former to the later; the father (teaches it) to his son when he is a student (brahmakârin).

This same cake on eight potsherds for Agni is indispensable on both occasions (at the new- and full-moon ceremonies).

For whatever deity sacrificial food is taken, to that deity they offer it up in the fire (Agni);--and if he is about to offer it up in the fire, why should he announce it to another deity? To Agni alone therefore (it is announced).

That (Soma) however, injured him; it flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; from his mouth alone it did not flow, but from all the other (openings of the) vital airs it flowed; hence (was instituted) at that time the ishti, called Sautrâmanî: on the occasion of that (ceremony) it is explained how the gods healed him .

However, he himself desecrated the sacrifice, for what pure (Soma) there was left in the tub he let flow (into the fire), saying, 'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe !' The moment it reached the fire, itdeveloped (into human shape), or, as some say, it so developed whilst on its way (to the fire). It became possessed of Agni and Soma, of all sciences, all glory, all nourishment, all prosperity.

Danu and Danâyû received him like mother and father , whence they call him Dânava.

Had he said, 'Grow thou, the foe (slayer) of Indra!' he (Vritra) would certainly have forthwith slain Indra.
tasmādu ha smeṣumātrameva tiryaṅvardhata iśumātram prāṅkṣo vaivāvaraṃ samudraṃ dadhāvava pūrvaṃ sa yāvatsa āsa sahaiva tāvadannāda āsa //	And because he (Tvashtri) said, 'Grow thou!' therefore he (Vritra) grew an arrow's range sideways and an arrow's range forward: he forced back both the western ocean and the eastern one; and in proportion as he extended did he devour the food.
tasmai ha sma pūrvāhṇe devāḥ / aśanamabhiharanti madhyandine manuṣyā aparāhṇe pitaraḥ //	In the fore-noon the gods offered him food, at mid-day the men, and in the after-noon the Fathers.

That one is nothing to you: why then do ye support that Dasyu against me? Come over to me!'

He offered them that Agni-Soma cake on eleven potsherds: this is the reason why there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma.

Such then is the significance of the full-moon offering; and he who, knowing this, performs the full-moon offering in this wise, attains to the same state of prosperity, becomes thus endowed with glory, becomes such a consumer of food (as Vritra).

He (Indra) said, 'Thou shalt be my food!' He replied, 'So be it!' He accordingly cut him in twain; and from that (part) of his which was of the Soma nature , he made the moon, and that which was demoniacal (asurya) he made enter these creatures as their belly; hence people say : 'Vritra was then a consumer of food, and Vritra is so now.' For even now, whenever that one (the moon) waxes fuller, it fills itself out of this world ; and wheneverthese creatures crave for food, they pay tribute to this Vritra, the belly. Whosoever knows that Vritra as a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.

They replied, 'For whatever deity they shall take out sacrificial food, they shall in the first place offer to you some clarified butter!' Whenever, therefore, they take out sacrificial food for any deity, they in the first place offer two butter-portions to Agni and Soma. This does not take place at the Soma-sacrifice, nor at the animal offering; for they said, 'for whatever deity they take out .

For this reason they sacrifice in Agni (the fire) to all the gods; and for this reason they say that Agni is all the deities.
māmeva vaḥ sarvebhyo juhvatu tadvo 'haṃ mayyābhajāmīti tasmātsomaṃ sarvebhyo devebhyo juhvati tasmādāhuḥ somaḥ sarvā devatā iti //	Soma then said, 'Me they shall offer up to all of you, and thus I give you a share in me!' For this reason they offer up Soma to all the gods; and hence they say that Soma is all the deities.

Thus the gods came in a three-foldway to consist of one deity; and he who knows this becomes individually the chief of his own (people).

But (it may be objected) if this is twofold only, why then this manifold performance:--the two butter-portions for Agni and Soma, the low-voiced offering to Agni and Soma, and the rice-cake for Agni and Soma,--when by means of any one of these he obtains all, why then this manifold performance? [The answer to this objection is that] so manifold is the power, the generative force of Agni and Soma.

Sameness of performance is also avoided in this way: in a low voice (he utters the formulas when) he offers of the butter, and with a loud voice of the cake; and what is (uttered) in a low voice, that is the manner of Pragâpati: hence he recites for that (low-voicedoffering) an anushtubh-verse as the invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ), for the anushtubh represents speech, and Pragâpati also is speech.

These creatures, indeed, are of two kinds, viz. such as have teeth on one side only, and such as have teeth on both sides ; and verily he who sacrifices, knowingthus the generative power of Agni and Soma, becomes rich in offspring and cattle.

He therefore now compresses (that part of) his belly which relates to the Asuras; and next morning, by means of the oblations, that which relates to the gods.
sa vai saṃpratyevopavaset /	Now the practice regarding the full-moon ceremony is as follows:
saṃprati vṛtraṃ hanāni saṃprati dviṣantam bhrātṛvyaṃ hanānīti //	One may (enter on the) fast at the very time (of full moon), thinking, 'Now I will slay Vritra, now I will slay the spiteful enemy!'

He, on the other hand, who prefers to fast on the second day (only), is as one who crushes from behind a retreating (enemy) before he is able to resist the attack: striking in one direction , in fact, is he who thus keeps the fast on the second day only.
sa vai saṃpratyevopavaset /	Let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full moon).

Thus he who, knowing this, enters upon the fast at the very time (of full moon) becomes a consumer of food: let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full moon).

Hence he thereby places the eyes in the front; and for this reason these eyes are in the front (of the head).

This, however, is rather unintelligible; for the several dishes of sacrificial food (havis) represent the body of the sacrifice; when therefore he offers in front of (or before) the havis, he thereby places the eyes in the front. Let him rather make the offerings (in that part of the fire) where he thinks the fiercest blaze is; for only by being offered in blazing (fire) are oblations successful .

If, however (it were asserted), on the contrary, that what is black is related to Agni, and what is white is related to Soma,--[the answer would be:--] what sees is of the nature of Agni, for dry, as it were, are the eyes of one who looks, and that which is dry relates to Agni;--and what sleeps is of the nature of Soma, for moist, as it were, are the eyes of one who is asleep, and moist also is Soma. And, verily, he who thus knows those two butter-portions to be eyes, remains endowed with eye-sight till old age in this world, and starts in yonder world possessed of eye-sight.

Now the gods knew that Vritra had been slain and that Indra had concealed himself.

Agni discovered him and stayedwith him (as a guest) that (day and) night. He (Indra), namely, is the Vasu of the gods, for he is their hero.

This is the reason why there is a rice-cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.

They prepared Soma for him. Now this king Soma, the food of the gods, is no other than the moon . When he[paragraph continues] (the moon, masc.) is not seen that night either in the east or in the west, then he visits this world; and here he enters into the waters (f.) and plants (f.). He is indeed a treasure for the gods, he is their food. And since during that night he here dwells together (amâ vas), therefore that (night of new moon) is called amâvâsyâ (the dwelling together, or at home).

Having prepared and coagulated it, and made it strong (pungent), they gave it to him .

'This does not satiate me, prepare for me what will satiate me!' That invigorating draught they indeed prepared forhim, and therefore even one who has not performed the Soma-sacrifice, may offer the Sânnâyya.

And, verily, he who knows this, overcomes all evil and leaves nothing remaining of evil.

For king Soma, the food of the gods, indeed, is no other than the moon. When he is not seen that night either in the east or in the west, then he visits this world, and here enters into the waters and plants.

Now the gods were desirous as to how that (food) might (be made to) come back to them; how it might not perish away from them. For this they put their trust in those who prepare the libation of sweet and sour milk (sânnâyya), thinking, 'when they have prepared it, they will offer it to us.' And, verily, in him, who knows this, both his own kin and strangers put their trust; for in him, who attains to the highest rank, people indeed put their trust.

But the former is of a nature hostile to the latter, and for this reason, though this one (the moon, Vritra) had previously (to the night of new moon) risen at a great distance from him (the sun, Indra), he now swims towards him and enters into his open mouth.

Let him, nevertheless, offer it to 'Indra;' for Indra he was before the slaying of Vritra, and Indra he is after slaying Vritra: therefore let him offer it to 'Indra .'

When the Gâyatrî flew towards Soma (the moon), a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (parna) either of the Gâyatrî or of king Soma ; and on falling down it became a parna (palâsa) tree; whence its name parna. May thatwhich then was of the Soma nature be here with us now!' so he thinks, and for this reason he drives away the calves with a parna branch.

Some people add here the formula , 'Going near are ye!' but let him not say this, because thereby another (an enemy) approaches (the sacrificer).

As soon as they have performed the Agnihotra, the pot is made ready.

'Such and such a one,' (the milker replies.) 'This one is Visvâyu (containing all life),' he (the Adhvaryu) says. He then asks regarding the second one, 'Which didst thou milk?' 'Such and such a one,' is the reply. 'This one is Visvakarman (all-doing),' he says. He then asks regarding the third, 'Which didst thou milk?' 'Such and such a one,' is the reply.

Having then taken it off (the fire), he coagulates it : he thereby makes it sharp (pungent); for this reason he coagulates it, after taking it off (the fire).

Just as on a former occasion , when taking sacrificial food for a deity, he announces it (to that deity), in like manner he now announces it to the deity, saying, 'Thee, the portion of Indra!' By saying 'with Soma I coagulate thee,' he makes it palatable to the gods.

Whoever does all these things, has discharged his duties: by him all is obtained, all is conquered.

For this reason it consists of four cuttings.

The fourfold cutting, however, is the approved (practice) among the Kuru-Pañkâlas, and for this reason a fourfold cutting takes place (with us ).

Let him therefore cut off only a moderate quantity, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice.

Butter, doubtless, is palatable to the gods; hence he thereby renders it palatable to the gods: for this reason butter is on both sides of it. The invitatory prayer (anuvâkyâ, f.), doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the offering-prayer (yâgyâ, f.) is this (earth)--these two are females.

Now the vashat, indeed,is no other than that scorching one (the sun). When he rises he approaches yonder (sky); and when he sets he approaches this (earth): hence whatever is brought forth here by these two, that they bring forth through that male.

For the same reason let him make the offering either simultaneously with the vashat or (immediately) after the vashat has been pronounced.
devapātraṃ vā eṣa yadvaṣaṭkāraḥ /	A vessel of the gods, doubtless, is that vashat.

If, on the other hand, he were to make the offering before the vashat, it would be lost, as would be that (food) falling to the ground: for this reason also let him make the offering either simultaneously with the vashat or after it has been pronounced.
tadyathā yonau retaḥ siñcet /	As seed is poured into the womb, so here.

asau vā anavākyeyaṃ yājyā /	The invitatory formula, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the offering-formula is this (earth).
sā vai gāyatrīyaṃ triṣṭubasau sa vai gāyatrīmanvāha tadamūmanubruvannasau hyanuvākyemāmanvāheyaṃ hi gāyatrī //	The gâyatrî metre also is this (earth), and the trishtubhis yonder (sky) He recites the gâyatrî verse, thereby reciting yonder (sky), for the invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ) is yonder (sky).

Over yonder (sky) he places the vashat, for yonder (sky) also is the trishtubh. Thereby he makes those two (sky and earth) yoke-fellows; and as such they feed together; and after their common meal all these creatures get food .
sa vā aṅkhayannivaivānuvākyāmanubrūyāt /	Let him pronounce the invitatory formula lingering, as it were: the invitatory formula, namely, is yonder (sky), and the brihat(-sâman) also is yonder (sky), since its form is that of the brihat.

With the invitatory formula he calls (the gods), and with theoffering-formula he presents (food to them): hence the invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ) has some such form as 'I call,' 'We call,' 'Come hither!' 'Sit on the barhis!' for with it he calls. With the offering-formula (yâgyâ) he offers: hence the offering-formula has some such form as, 'Accept the sacrificial food!' 'Relish the sacrificial food!' 'Accept the potation (âvrishâyasva)!' 'Eat! Drink! There !' for by it he offers that which (is indicated by) 'there!'

sā yājyā syādiyaṃ hi yājyā tasyā asyā upariṣṭāllakṣmauṣadhayo vanaspataya āpo 'gnirimāḥ prajāḥ //	The offering-formula then should be one that has its characteristic indication (further) back ; for the offering-formula is this (earth), and this same (earth) has plants, trees, waters, fire, and these creatures for its mark above.

sa vai vaugiti karoti / vāgvai vaṣaṭkāro vāgreto reta evaitatsiñcati ṣaḍityṛtavo vai ṣaṭtadṛtuṣvevaitadretaḥ sicyate tadṛtavo retaḥ siktamimāḥ prajāḥ prajanayanti tasmādevaṃ vaṣaṭkaroti //	He pronounces (the syllable) vauk ; for, assuredly, the vashat-call is speech; and speech means seed: hence he thereby casts seed. 'Shat' (he pronounces), because there are six seasons: he thereby casts that seed into the seasons, and the seasons cause that seed so cast to spring up here as creatures. This is the reason why he pronounces the vashat.
ubhaye prājāpatyāḥ prajāpateḥ piturdāyamupeyuretāvevārdhamāsau ya evāpūryate taṃ devā upāyanyo 'pakṣīyate tamasurāḥ //	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, entered upon their father Pragâpati's inheritance , to wit, these two half-moons. The gods entered upon the one which waxes, and the Asuras on the one which wanes.
te devā akāmayanta /	They went on worshipping and toiling.

ya eṣo 'surāṇāmāsīt /	Which belonged to the Asuras.
yadā vā etā ubhau pariplavete atha māso bhavati māsaśaḥ saṃvatsaraḥ sarvaṃ vai saṃvatsaraḥ sarvameva taddevā asurāṇāṃ samavṛñjata sarvasmātsapatnānasurānnirabhajantsarvamvevaiṣa etatsapatnānāṃ saṃvṛṅkte sarvasmātsapatnānnirbhajati ya evametadveda //	Now when these two revolve, then the month is produced; and month (revolving) after month, the year (is produced). But the year, doubtless, means all; hence the gods thereby appropriated all that belonged tothe Asuras, they deprived their enemies, the Asuras, of all. And in the same way he (the sacrificer) who knows this appropriates all that belongs to his enemies, deprives his enemies of all.
sa yo devānāmāsīt / sa yavāyuvata hi tena devā yo 'surāṇāṃ so 'yavā na hi tenāsurā ayuvata //	That (half-moon) which belonged to the gods is (called) yavan, for the gods possessed themselves (yu, 'to join') of it; and that which belonged to the Asuras is ayavan, because the Asuras did not possess themselves of it.

The day is (called) sabda, the night sagarâ, the months yavya, the year sumeka : sveka ('eminently one'), doubtless, is the same as sumeka. And since the Hotri is concerned with these--to wit, the yavan and the ayavan, which (according to some) is yavan--they call (his office) yâvihotram .
yajñena vai devāḥ /	Now by means of the sacrifice the gods ascended to heaven.

sa yenaiva devā divamupodakrāman / teno evārcantaḥ śrāmyantaśceruratha yo 'yaṃ devaḥ paśūnāmīṣṭe ya ihāhīyata //	The gods went on worshipping and toiling with the same (sacrifice) by which they had ascended to heaven. Now the god who rules over the cattle, and who was left behind here,--
sa aikṣata / ahāsya hāntaryantyu mā yajñāditi so 'nūccakrāma sa āyatayottarata upotpede sa eṣa sviṣṭakṛtaḥ kālaḥ //	He saw (what occurred, and said), 'I have been left behind: they are excluding me from the sacrifice!' He went up after them, and with his raised (weapon) rose up on the north--the time (when this happened) was that of the (performance of the) Svishtakrit.
te devā abruvan / mā visrakṣīriti te vai mā yajñānmāntargatāhutim me kalpayateti tatheti sa samabṛhatsa nāsyatsa na kaṃ canāhinat //	The gods said, 'Do not hurl!' He said, 'Do not ye exclude me from the sacrifice! Set apart an oblation for me!' They replied, 'So be it!' He withdrew (his weapon), and did not hurl it; nor did he injure any one.
te devā abruvan / yāvanti no havīṃṣi gṛhītānyabhūvantsarveṣāṃ teṣāṃ hutamupajānīta yathāsmā āhutiṃ kalpayāmeti //	The gods said (to one another), 'Whatever portions of sacrificial food have been taken out by us, they have all been offered up. Try to discoversome means by which we may set apart an oblation for him!'
yathāpūrvaṃ havīṃṣyabhighārayaikasmā avadānāya punarāpyāyayāyātayāmāni kuru tata ekaikamavadānamavadyeti //	They said to the Adhvaryu priest, 'Sprinkle the sacrificial dishes (with butter) in proper succession; and replenish them for the sake of one (additional) portion, and again render them fit for use; and then cut off one portion for each!'
yathāpūrvaṃ havīṃṣyabhyaghārayadekasmā avadānāya punarāpyāyayadayātayāmānyakarottata ekaikamavadānamavādyattasmādvāstavya ityāhurvāstu hi tadyajñasya yaddhuteṣu haviḥṣu tasmādyasyai kasyai ca devatāyai havirgṛhyate sarvatraiva sviṣṭakṛdanvābhaktaḥ sarvatra hyevainaṃ devā anvābhajan //	The Adhvaryu accordingly sprinkled the sacrificial dishes in proper succession, and replenished them for the sake of one (additional) portion, and again rendered them fit for use, and cut off one portion for each. This then is the reason why he (Rudra) is called Vâstavya , for a remainder (vâstu) is that part of the sacrifice which (is left) after the oblations have been made: hence, if sacrificial food is offered to any deity, the Svishtakrit (Agni, 'the maker of good offering') is afterwards invariably offered a share of it; because the gods invariably gave him a share after themselves.
tadvā agnaya iti kriyate / agnirvai sa devastasyaitāni nāmāni śarva iti yathā prācyā ācakṣate bhava iti yathā bāhīkāḥ paśūnām patī rudro 'gniriti tānyasyāśāntānyevetarāṇi nāmānyagnirityeva śāntatamaṃ tasmādagnaya iti kriyate sviṣṭakṛta iti //	That (offering) then is certainly made to 'Agni,' for, indeed, Agni is that god;--his are these names: Sarva, as the eastern people call him; Bhava, as the Bâhîkas (call him); Pasûnâm pati ('lord of beasts,' Pasupati), Rudra, Agni . The name Agni, doubtless, is the most auspicious[paragraph continues] (sânta), and the other names of his are inauspicious: hence it is offered to (him under the name of) 'Agni,' and to (him as) the Svishtakrit.
te hocuḥ / yattvayyamutra satyayakṣmahi tannaḥ sviṣṭaṃ kurviti tadebhyaḥ sviṣṭamakarottasmātsviṣṭakṛta iti //	They (the gods) said, 'What we have offered unto thee who art in yonder place , do thou render that well-offered (svishta) for us!' He made it well-offered for them; and this is the reason why (it is offered) to (Agni as) the Svishtakrit.

'May he offer Soma's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Soma's butter-portion.--'May he offer Agni's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to that indispensable cake for Agni which is (offered) on both occasions (at the new- and full-moon sacrifices).

'Of Soma may he offer!' But let him not do this; for those who make the deity precede the 'may he offer!' violate the proper order at the sacrifice, since it is by pronouncing the 'may he offer,' that he pronounces what comes first here: let him therefore place the 'may he offer' first.
yatra vā ado devatā āvāhayati tadapi svam mahimānamāvāhayati tadataḥ prāṅnyai kiṃ cana svāya mahimna iti kriyate tadatra tam prīṇāti tatho hāsyaiṣo 'moghāyāvāhito bhavati tasmādāha yakṣatsvam mahimānamiti //	[The Hotri continues to recite]: 'May he sacrifice to his own greatness!' When, on that occasion , he asks him (Agni) to bring hither the deities, he also makes him bring hither his own greatness; but before this no worship of any kind has been offered to 'his (Agni's) own greatness:' and he therefore now gratifies him, and thus that (fire) has been established so as to prevent failure on his (the sacrificer's) part.
ā yajatāmejyā iṣa iti /	This is the reason why he says 'may he sacrifice to his own greatness.'
prajā vā iṣastā evaitadyāyajūkāḥ karoti tā imāḥ prajā yajamānā arcantyaḥ śrāmyantyaścaranti //	'By sacrifice may he obtain for himself food worthy of sacrifice !' the food, doubtless, is these creatures: he thereby makes them eager to sacrifice, and these creatures go on sacrificing, worshipping and performing austerities.
so adhvarā jātavedā juṣatāṃ haviriti / tadyajñasyaivaitatsamṛddhimāśāste yaddhi devā havirjuṣante tena hi mahajjayati tasmādāha juṣatāṃ haviriti //	'May he, the knower of beings, (perform) the sacred cult; may he graciously accept the sacrificial food!' Thereby he prays for success to this sacrifice; for when the gods graciously accept the sacrificial food, then he (the sacrificer) gains great things : for this reason he says 'may he graciously accept the sacrificial food!'
yājyānuvākye avakLptatame bhavatastṛtīyasavanaṃ vai sviṣṭakṛdvaiśvadevaṃ vai tṛtīyasavanam piprīhi devāṃ uśato yaviṣṭheti tadanuvākyāyai vaiśvadevamagne yadadya viśo adhvarasya hotariti tadyājyāyai vaiśvadevaṃ tadyadete evaṃrūpe bhavatasteno ete tṛtīyasavanasya rūpaṃ tasmādvā ete atra yājyānuvākye avakLptatame bhavataḥ //	The reason why on this occasion the invitatory and offering-formulas are made closely to correspond to each other (avakliptatama), is that the svishtakrit (is equivalent to) the evening libation, and the evening libation, doubtless, belongs to the Visve Devâh (the 'All-gods ) . 'Gladden thou the longing gods, O youngest!' this much in the invitatory formula refers to the Visve Devâh . 'O Agni, Hotri of the cult! when this day (thou comest) to the men ;' this much in the offering-formula refers to the Visve Devâh. And because such is the form of these two (formulas), therefore they are ofthe form of the evening libation; and this is why the invitatory and offering-formulas on this occasion are made closely to correspond to each other.
te vai triṣṭubhau bhavataḥ /	This is why they are both trishtubh verses.
uto anuṣṭubhāveva bhavataḥ /	Or they are both anushtubh verses.
vāstvanuṣṭubvāstu sviṣṭakṛdvāstāvevaitadvāstu dadhāti pesukaṃ vai vāstu pisyati ha prajayā paśubhiryasyaivaṃ viduṣo 'nuṣṭubhau bhavataḥ //	The anushtubh is residue (or site, vâstu), and the svishtakrit also is residue: hence he thereby puts a residue to a residue . And, verily, one who knows this, and whose (invitatory and offering-formulas) are two anushtubh verses, his homestead (vâstu) is prosperous, and he himself prospers in regard to progeny and cattle.
tadu ha bhāllaveyaḥ / anuṣṭubhamanuvākyāṃ cakre triṣṭubhaṃ yājyāmetadubhayam parigṛhṇāmīti sarathātpapāta sa patitvā bāhumapi śaśre sa parimamṛśe yatkimakaraṃ tasmādidamāpaditi sa haitadeva mene yadviloma yajñe 'karamiti tasmānna viloma kuryātsacandasāveva syātāmubhe vaivānuṣṭubhā ubhe vā triṣṭubhau //	Now here Bhâllabeya made the invitatory formula (consist of) an anushtubh verse, and the offering-formula of a trishtubh verse, thinking, 'I thus obtain (the benefits of) both.' He fell from the cart, and in falling, broke his arm. He reflected: 'This has befallen because of something or other I have done.' He then bethought himself of this: '(It has befallen) because of some violation, on my part, of the proper course of the sacrifice.' Hence one must not violate the proper course (of sacrificial performance); but let both (formulas) be verses of the same metre, either both anushtubh verses, or both trishtubh verses.

From that side, indeed, he arose , and there they (the gods) appeased him: for this reason he cuts from the north part, and offers on the north part.
sa vā abhyardha ivetarābhya āhutibhyo juhoti /	He offers on this side (in front), as it were, of the other oblations.

For this reason he offers on this side, as it were, of the other oblations.
eṣa vai sa yajñaḥ / yena taddevā divamupodakrāmanneṣa āhavanīyo 'tha ya ihāhīyata sa gārhapatyastasmādetaṃ gārhapatyātprāñcamuddharanti //	That (fire)---to wit, the Âhavanîya--is, indeed, that sacrifice by which the gods then ascended to heaven; and that (other fire) which was left behind here, is the Gârhapatya: hence they take out the former from the Gârhapatya, (so as to be) before (east) of it.
taṃ vā aṣṭāsu vikrameṣvādadhīta / aṣṭākṣarā vai gāyatrī gāyatryaivaitaddivamupotkrāmati //	He may lay it (the Âhavanîya) down at the distance of eight steps (from the Gârhapatya); for of eight syllables, doubtless, consists the gâyatrî hence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of the gâyatrî.
ekādaśākṣarā vai triṣṭuptriṣṭubhaivaitaddivamupotkrāmati //	Or he may lay it down at the distance of eleven steps ; for of eleven syllables, indeed, consists the trishtubh: hence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of the trishtubh.

Here, however, there is no (fixed) measure: let him, therefore, lay it down where in his own mind he may think proper . If he takes it ever so little east (of the Gârhapatya), he ascends to heaven by it.

For, as it were, a displacement of the sacrificial dishes would take place, if they were to cook them on the Gârhapatya. The Âhavanîya is the sacrifice: we will perform the sacrifice in the sacrifice!'
uto gārhapatya eva śrapayanti /	However, they also do cook on the Gârhapatya, arguing, 'The former is indeed âhavanîya (i.e.

He may therefore do it on whichever (fire) he pleases.

'What is unnakedness for thee?' 'Let them strew (sacrificial grass) all round me!' For this reason they strew (sacrificial grass) all round the fire. 'I dread thirst.' 'How art thou to be satiated?' 'May I satiate myself after the priest has been satisfied!' Let him therefore, on the completion of the sacrifice, order that the priest be satisfied; for then he satisfies the sacrifice.
// divaṃ oṣasaṃ vā mithunyenayā syāmiti tāṃ sambabhūva //	Pragâpati conceived a passion for his owndaughter,--either the Sky or the Dawn .

Pierce him!' Rudra, taking aim, pierced him. Half of his seed fell to the ground.
tasmādetadṛṣiṇābhyanūktam /	And thus it came to pass.

This (became) the chant (uktha) called âgnimâruta ; in (connection with)this it is set forth how the gods caused that seed to spring . When the anger of the gods subsided, they cured Pragâpati and cut out that dart of this. (Rudra); for Pragâpati, doubtless, is this sacrifice.
te hocuḥ / upajānīta yathedaṃ nāmuyāsatkanīyo hāhuteryathedaṃ syāditi //	They said (to one another), 'Think of some means by which that (part of the sacrifice torn out with the dart) may not be lost, and how it may be but a small portion of the offering itself!'

They accordingly took it round to Bhaga, who sat on the south side. Bhaga (Savitri) looked at it: it burnt out his eyes .
te hocuḥ /	And thus it came to pass.

They accordinglytook it round to Pûshan. Pûshan tasted it: it knocked out his teeth. And thus it came to pass. Hence they say, 'Pûshan is toothless;' and therefore, when they prepare a mess of boiled rice (karu) for Pûshan, they prepare it from ground rice, as is done for one toothless.

They accordingly took it round to Brihaspati. Brihaspati hasted to Savitri for his impulsion (influence, prasava ), for assuredly Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods. 'Impel (influence) this for me!' he said. Savitri, as the impeller, accordingly impelled it for him, and being thus impelled by Savitri, it did not injure him: and thus it was henceforth appeased.
sa yatprāśitramavadyati /	This, then, is essentially the same as the fore-portion.
yadevātrāviddhaṃ yajñasya yadrudriyaṃ tadevaitannirmimīte 'thāpa upaspṛśati śāntirāpastadadbhiḥ śamayatyatheḍām paśūntsamavadyati //	Now when he cuts off the fore-portion, he cuts out what is injured in the sacrifice,--what belongs to Rudra. Thereupon he touches water: water is (a means) of lustration, hence he lustrates by means of water .
sa vai yāvanmātramivaivāvadyet /	He now cuts off piece by piece the idâ , (which represents) cattle.

He should (according to some) put clarified butter on one side only, either below or above: thus that which is hard becomes soft and flows forth; and for this reason he should put butter on one side only, either below or above.
dvirhaviṣo 'vadāyāthopariṣṭādājyasyābhighārayati tadyathaiva yajñasyāvadānamevametat //	Having (nevertheless ) made an underlayer of butter and a double cutting from the oblation (havis), he pours butter on the upper side of it; for it is only in this way that this becomes part of the sacrifice.
tanna pūrveṇa pariharet /	Let him not carry it (to the Brahman) along the front (east) side of the Âhavanîya fire); (though) some, it is true, do carry it along the front side.

Let him therefore cross over in this way (behind the paridhis); for thus he does not impose Rudra's power on the cattle and he removes that (dart) sideways .
devasya tvā savituḥ prasave 'śvinorbāhubhyām pūṣṇo hastābhyām pratigṛhṇāmīti //	He (the Brahman) receives it, with the text , 'At the impulse (prasava) of the divine Savitri I receive thee with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan!'

agneṣṭvāsyena prāśnāmīti na vā agniṃ kiṃ cana hinasti tatho hainametanna hinasti //	He eats the fore-portion, with the text , 'With Agni's mouth I eat thee!' for Agni, assuredly, it does not injure in any way; and so neither does it injure him (the Brahman).
tanna dadbhiḥ khādet / nenma idaṃ rudriyaṃ dato hinasaditi tasmānna dadbhiḥ khādet //	He must not chew it with his teeth: 'lest this power of Rudra should injure my teeth!' so (he thinks), and therefore he must not chew it with his teeth.
athāpa ācāmati / śāntirāpastadadbhiḥ śāntyā śamayate 'tha parikṣālya pātraṃ //	He then rinses his mouth with water;--water is (a means of) purification: hence he purifies himself with water, (that is, a means of) purification. After he has rinsed the vessel ,--
athāsmai brahmabhāgam paryāharanti /	They bring him the Brahman's portion .

He sits facing that portion. As regards the fore-portion, that they have already brought to him and he has eaten it. In the Brahman's portion which they now bring to him, he obtains his own share; and henceforth he watches what remains incomplete of the sacrifice: for this reason they bring him the Brahman's portion.

Those (priests) who, in the midst of the sacrifice, perform the idâ, which represents the domestic offerings (pâkayagña) , tear the sacrifice to pieces, injure it. Now the Brahman, assuredly, is the best physician: hence the Brahman thereby restores the sacrifice; but, if he were to sit there talking, he would not restore it: he must therefore maintain silence.
sa yadi purā mānuṣīṃ vācaṃ vyāharet / tatro vaiṣṇavīmṛcaṃvā yajurvā japedyajño vai viṣṇustadyajñam punarārabhate tasyo haiṣā prāyaścittiḥ //	If he should utter any human sound before that time, let him there and then mutter some Rik or Yagus-text addressed to Vishnu; for Vishnu isthe sacrifice, so that he thereby again obtains a hold on the sacrifice: and this is the expiation of that (breach of silence).

In this there is nothing that requires explanation.

By the mind, assuredly, all this (universe) is obtained (or pervaded, âptam): hence he thereby obtains this All by the mind.--'May Brihaspati spread (carry through) this sacrifice! May he restore the sacrifice uninjured!'--he thereby restores what was torn asunder.--'May all the gods rejoice here!'--'all the gods,' doubtless, means the All: hence he thereby restores (the sacrifice) by means of the All. He may add, 'Step forward!' if he choose; or, if he choose, he may omit it.

'Wherefrom wilt thou save me?' 'A flood will carry away all these creatures : from that I will save thee!' 'How am I to rear thee?' It said, 'As long as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish devours fish.

When I outgrow that, thou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me down to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.' It soon became a ghasha (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all fish) .

Thoushalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship ; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.'

The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn he tied the rope of the ship, and by that means he passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain.
sa hovāca /	It then said, 'I have saved thee.

As the watersubsides, thou mayest gradually descend!' Accordingly he gradually descended, and hence that (slope) of the northern mountain is called 'Alarm's descent .' The flood then swept away all these creatures, and Manu alone remained here.
sorcaṃcrāmyaṃścacāra prajākāmaḥ /	Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities.

Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varuna met her. They said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Manu's daughter,' she replied.
tāṃ hocatuḥ kāsīti /	'Say (thou art) ours,' they said.

They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did not agree , but passed by them. She came to Manu. Manu said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Thy daughter,' she replied.

She replied,[paragraph continues] 'Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!' He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice.
tayārcaṃcrāmyaṃścacāra prajākāmaḥ /	With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring.
tayemām prajātim prajajñe yeyam manoḥ prajātiryāmvenayā kāṃ cāśiṣamāśāsta sāsmai sarvā samārdhyata //	Through her he generated this race, which is this race of Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to him.

sā vai pañcāvattā bhavati / paśavo vā iḍā pāṅtā vai paśavastasmātpañcāvattā bhavati //	It (the idâ) consists of a fivefold cutting; for the idâ, doubtless, means cattle, and cattle consist of five parts : for this reason it (the idâ) consists of a fivefold cutting.

Having then handed over the former (the idâ) to the Hotri , he passes by him towards the south.
taddhotauṣṭhayornilimpate manasaspatinā te hutasyāśnāmīṣe prāṇāyeti //	He anoints the Hotri here (with clarified butter taken from the idâ); and with it the Hotri anoints his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered by the lord of the mind, I eat for sap, for out-breathing!'
atha hoturiha nilimpati / taddhotauṣṭhayornilimpate vācaspatinā te hutasyāśnāmyūrja udānāyeti //	He then anoints the Hotri here ; and with it the Hotri anoints his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered by the lord of speech, I eat for strength, for in-breathing!'

Accordingly by that (butter, taken from the idâ, and smeared on his lips) he promoted it (the idâ to a safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And in like manner this one also thereby promotes (the idâ to a safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And though he does not (at present) eat (the idâ) visibly, lest he should eat it before it is invoked, he nevertheless promotes it (to a safe place), when he smears the (butter) on his lips.

He accordingly called it to him in a low voice (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And in like manner this one (the Hotri) thereby calls it (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!'

Hither is called the Vâmadevya (chant), together with the atmosphere: may the Vâmadevya, together with the atmosphere, call me! Hither is called the Brihat (chant), together with the sky: may the Brihat, together with the sky, call me!' In thus calling her (the Idâ) to him, he calls to him both these (three) worlds and those chants .

Hither (thither) is called Idâ! May Idâ also call us to her!' In saying, 'Idâ is calledhither,' he, in a direct way, calls her, who is thereby called hither, as being what she really was: a cow, assuredly, she was, and a cow is four-footed; and therefore he calls her four times .

By saying, 'May Idâ also call us to her,' he does not omit himself, and, besides, it (the formula) is changed. By (the second), 'Idâ is called hither!' he again calls her hitherwards; so that he thereby (and by the second, 'Hither is called Idâ,' again) calls her hitherwards and thitherwards.

Those Brâhmanas, who have studied and teach the Veda, assuredly prosper the sacrifice, since they spread (perform) and produce it: these he thereby propitiates. And the calves also assuredly make the lord of sacrifice prosper; for the lord of sacrifice who possesses abundance of them, does indeed prosper; for this reason he says, 'They who are to prosper the lord of sacrifice.'

He thereby calls to him those two, heaven and earth, within which all this (universe) is embraced.--'Hither is called this sacrificer:' thereby he calls the sacrificer to him. Why he does not mention his name on this occasion, is that this is a mysterious benediction on the idâ. Were he, on the contrary, to mention the name, he would do what is human, and the human certainly is inauspicious at the sacrifice: hence he does not mentionthe name, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice .
uttarasyāṃ devayajyāyāmupahūta iti / tadasmā etajjīvātumeva paro 'kṣamāśāste jīvanhi pūrvamiṣṭvāthāparaṃ yajate //	'Hither (he is) called for future worship of the gods;' he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on this (sacrificer); for as he sacrificed heretofore, so, while living, he will sacrifice hereafter.
tadasmā etatprajāmeva paro 'kṣamāśāste / yasya hi prajā bhavatyamuṃ lokamātmanaityathāsmiṃloke prajā yajate tasmātprajottarā devayajyā //	Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of offspring for him; for whosoever has offspring,--while he, on his part, goes to yonder world, his offspring sacrifice in this world: hence future worship of the gods means offspring.
tadasmā etatpaśūneva paro 'kṣamāśāste yasya hi paśavo bhavanti sa pūrvamiṣṭvāthāparaṃ yajate //	Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of cattle for him; for whosoever has cattle, will sacrifice hereafter, as he has sacrificed heretofore.
bhūyasi haviṣkaraṇa upahūta iti / tadasmā etajjīvātumeva paro 'kṣamāśāste jīvanhi pūrvamiṣṭvātha bhūyobhūya eva haviṣkaroti //	'Hither (he is) called for more abundant havis-offering;' he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on him; for as he has sacrificed heretofore, so while living will he hereafter again and again make offerings.
tadasmā etatprajāmeva paro 'kṣamāśāste yasya hi prajā bhavatyeka ātmanā bhavatyathota daśadhā prajayā haviṣkriyate tasmātprajā bhūyo haviṣkaraṇam //	Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of offspring for this (sacrificer); for whosoever possesses offspring,--though he, of his own self, be one only, yet that offering is made tenfold by his offspring: hence offspring means more abundant offering.
tadasmā etatpaśūneva paro 'kṣamāśāste / yasya hi paśavo bhavanti sa pūrvamiṣṭvātha bhūyobhūya eva haviṣkaroti //	Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of cattle for him; for whosoever possesses cattle, will make offering again and again, as he has sacrificed heretofore.

Now in praying for the blessing of cattle, he prays for prosperity; for cattle means prosperity: hence through these two benedictions everything is obtained; and therefore these two benedictions are here pronounced.

nāgnau juhvati paśavo vā iḍā netpaśūnagnau pravṛṇajāmeti tasmānnāgnau juhvati //	They (the priests and sacrificer) eat it (the idâ), and do not offer it up in the fire; for assuredly the idâ means cattle: hence they do not offer it in the fire, lest they should throw the cattle into the fire.
prāṇeṣveva hūyate /	In the vital airs rather it is offered, partly in the Hotri, partly in the Sacrificer, partly in the Adhvaryu.

But the dhruvâ represents the sacrificer: hence this will be eaten by the sacrificer. And if he does not now visibly eat it, lest he should eat before the sacrifice is completed, it nevertheless is now (symbolically) eaten by him. All of themeat (of the idâ): 'May it be offered for me in all!' thus (he thinks). Five eat of it,--the idâ indeed means cattle, and cattle are fivefold: hence five eat of it.
atha yatra pratipadyate / taccaturdhā puroḍāśaṃ kṛtvā barhiṣadaṃ karoti tadatra pitṛṇāṃ bhājanena catasro vā avāntaradiśo 'vāntaradiśo vai pitarastasmāccaturdhā puroḍāśaṃ kṛtvā barhiṣadaṃ karoti //	Now when he (the Hotri) intones (in a loud voice) , he (the Adhvaryu) divides the (Agni) cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis (the sacrificial grass covering the altar). Here it lies in place of the fathers; for there are four intermediate quarters, and the intermediate quarters represent the fathers: for this reason he divides the cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis .
atha yatrāhopahūte dyāvāpṛthivī iti /	And when he recites, 'Hither are called heaven and earth,' he hands it (the shadavatta ) to the Âgnîdhra.

Agni (am I) by virtue of my Âgnîdhraship. Hail!' 'Hither is called father Heaven; may father Heaven call me to him! Agni (am I) by virtue of my Âgnîdhraship. Hail!' He, the Âgnîdhra, truly is the representative of heaven and earth, and therefore he eats (the shadavatta) in this manner.

For indeed this is a receiving of blessings: hence what blessings the priests on this occasion invoke on him, those he thereby receives and makes his own.
atha pavitrayormārjayante /	[On the conclusion of the invocation and the eating ] they cleanse themselves (with water poured)through the two strainers (pavitra, 'purifier').
pākayajñiyayeva vā etadiḍayācāriṣuḥ pavitrapūtā yadata ūrdhvamasaṃsthitaṃ yajñasya tattanavāmahā iti tasmātpavitrayormārjayante //	For they have now performed the idâ, which represents the domestic offerings; and thinking, 'Purified by the purifiers we will now perform what part of the sacrifice remains still unaccomplished,' they cleanse themselves with the strainers.
atha te pavitre prastare 'pisṛjati /	He (the Adhvaryu) then throws the two strainers on the prastara .
yajamāno vai prastaraḥ prāṇodānau pavitre yajamāne tatprāṇodānau dadhāti tasmātte pavitre prastare 'pisṛjati //	The prastara, doubtless, represents the sacrificer, and the two strainers the out-breathing and in-breathing: hence he thereby invokes out-breathing and in-breathing on the sacrificer; and for this reason he throws the strainers on the prastara.
te vā ete ulmuke udūhanti /	They now remove two burning samidhs (from the Âhavanîya fire).
anuyājebhyo yātayāmeva vā etadagnirbhavati devebhyo hi yajñamūhivānbhavatyayātayāmnyanuyājāṃstanavāmahā iti tasmādvā ete ulmuke udūhanti //	That fire, indeed, is now worn out, (and therefore useless) for the after-offerings, since it has been carrying the sacrifice to the gods: 'Let us perform the after-offerings in such (fire) as is not out-worn!' thus they think, and for this reason they remove those two burning samidhs (from the fire).
te punaranusaṃsparśayanti /	Thereupon they again move them close (to the fire).
punarevaitadagnimāpyāyayantyayātayāmānaṃ kurvantyayātayāmni yadata urdhvamasaṃsthitaṃ yajñasya tattanavāmā iti tasmātpunaranusaṃsparśayanti //	Thereby they cause the fire to increase again and to be no longer out-worn: 'Let us perform what part of the sacrifice remains still unaccomplished in such (fire) as is not out-worn!' so think they, and for this reason they again move them close (to the fire).
atha samidhamabhyādadhāti /	He (the Âgnîdhra) then puts on the kindling-stick[paragraph continues] (which was reserved at the time of kindling) .
saminddha evainametatsamiddhe yadata ūrdhvamasaṃsthitaṃ yajñasya tattanavāmahā iti tasmātsamidhamabhyādadhāti //	He thereby kindles that (fire): 'Let us perform in the well-kindled (fire) what part of the sacrifice remains unaccomplished!' thus he thinks, and for this reason he puts on the samidh.
eṣā te agne samittayā vardhasva cā ca pyāyasva vardhiṣīmahi ca vayamā ca pyāsiṣīmahīti tadyathaivādaḥ samidhyamānāyānvāhaivamevaitadanvāha tadetaddhotuḥ karma sa yadi manyeta na hotā vedetyapi svayameva yajamāno 'numantrayeta //	The Hotri consecrates it (the kindling-stick), with the formula , 'This, O Agni, is thy kindler; mayest thou grow and increase by it; and may we also grow and increase!' for even as before he recited over the fire when it was being kindled, so also now he recites. This is the Hotri's duty; but the sacrificer himself may pronounce the consecratory formula, if he think that the Hotri does not know it .
atha sammārṣṭi /	He (the Âgnîdhra) then sweeps (the fire) together.
yunaktyevainametadyukto yadata ūrdhvamasaṃsthitaṃ yajñasya tadvahāditi tasmātsammārṣṭi sakṛtsakṛtsammārṣṭi tristrirvā agre devebhyaḥ sammṛjanti nettathā karavāma yathā devebhya iti tasmātsakṛtsakṛtsammārṣṭyajāmitāyai jāmi ha kuryādyattriḥ pūrvaṃ triraparaṃ tasmātsakṛtsakṛtsammārṣṭi //	He thereby harnesses it: 'Thus harnessed, may it convey (to the gods) what part of the sacrifice still remains unaccomplished!' thus he thinks, and for this reason he sweeps it together. He sweepsonce (with the band of the fire-wood along each of the three enclosing-sticks); for thrice each time they swept for the gods on the former occasion : 'Lest we should do it in the same way as for the gods;' thus he thinks, and accordingly he sweeps once each time in order to avoid repetition (of sacrificial performance).
agne vājajidvājaṃ tvā sasṛvāṃsaṃ vājajitaṃ sammārjmīti sariṣyantamiti vā agra āha sariṣyanniva hi tarhi bhavatyathātra sasṛvāṃsamiti sasṛveva hyatra bhavati tasmādāha sasṛvāṃsamiti //	He sweeps (each time), with the formula , 'O Agni, food-gainer, I cleanse thee, the food-gainer, who hast hastened to the food!' On the former occasion he said, 'thee who art about to hasten (to the food),' for on that occasion he was indeed about to hasten thither; now, however, he says, who hast hastened (to the food),' for now he has indeed hastened thither: for this reason he says 'thee who hast hastened.'
athānuyājānyajati /	He now makes the after-offerings.
yā vā etena yajñena devatā hvayati yābhya eṣa yajñastāyate sarvā vai tattā iṣṭā bhavanti tadyattāsu sarvāsviṣṭāsvathaitatpaścevānuyajati tasmādanuyājā nāma //	Whatever gods he invokes by means of this sacrifice, and for whichever of them this sacrifice is performed, to all offering has now been made; and to all those to whom offering has been made, he now, after that, offers once more: hence the name 'after-offerings.'
atha yadanuyājānyajati /	Now this is why he makes the after-offerings.
candāṃsi vā anuyājāḥ paśavo vai devānāṃ candāṃsi tadyathedaṃ paśavo yuktā manuṣyebhyo vahantyevaṃ candāṃsi yuktāni devebhyo yajñaṃ vahanti tadyatra candāṃsi devāntsamatarpayannatha candāṃsi devāḥ samatarpayaṃstadatastatprāgabhūdyaccandāṃsi yuktāni devebhyo yajñamavākṣuryadenāntsamatītṛpan //	The after-offerings assuredly are the metres , and the metres are the cattle of the gods: hence as cattle, when harnessed, here convey (burdens) for men, so in like manner the metres, being harnessed,convey the sacrifice to the gods. Now the occasion on which the metres gratified the gods, and for which the gods, in their turn, then gratified the metres, was when before this the metres, on being harnessed, conveyed the sacrifice to the gods and thereby gratified them.
atha yadanuyājānyajati /	And this again is why he makes the after-offerings.
candāṃsi vā anuyājāścandāṃsyevaitatsaṃtarpayati tasmādanuyājānyajati tasmādyena vāhanena dhāvayettadvimucya brūyātpāyayatainatsuhitaṃ kurutetyeṣa u vāhanasyāpahnavaḥ //	The after-offerings are the metres: hence he thereby gratifies the metres, and for this reason also he makes the after-offerings. By whatever team, therefore, he has himself drawn, that (team) he would thereby unyoke, saying, 'Give it to drink, feed it well!' and thus his team is propitiated.
sa vai khalu barhiḥ prathamaṃ yajati /	In the first place he makes offering to the Barhis (sacrificial-grass covering).
tadvai kaniṣṭhaṃ candaḥ sadgāyatrī prathamā candasāṃ yujyate tadu tadvīryeṇaiva yacyeno bhūtvā divaḥ somamāharattadayathāyatham manyante yatkaniṣṭhaṃ candaḥ sadgāyatrī prathamā candasāṃ yujyate 'thātra yathāyathaṃ devāścandāṃsyakalpayannanuyājeṣu netpāpavasyasamasaditi //	Though the smallest metre, the gâyatrî is yoked first of the metres ; and this on account of its strength, since, having become a falcon, it carried off the Soma from heaven . They consider it unseemly, however, that the gâyatrî, being the smallest metre, should be yoked first of the metres; and the gods accordingly arranged the metres here, at the after-offerings, so as it ought to be, 'lest there should be a confusion.'
sa vai khalu barhiḥ prathamaṃ yajati /	In the first place, then, he offers to the Barhis.
ayaṃ vai loko barhiroṣadhayo barhirasminnevaitalloka oṣadhīrdadhāti tā imā asmiṃloka oṣadhayaḥ pratiṣṭhitāstadidaṃ sarvaṃ jagadasyāṃ teneyaṃ jagatī tajjagatīm prathamāmakurvan //	The Barhis indeed is this world; the Barhis is the plants: hence he thereby bestows plants on this world, and these plants are firmly rooted in this world. Now this entire universe (gagat) is contained in this (metre), and therefore the latter is (called) gagatî: this is why they have placed the gagatî metre first.
atha narāśaṃsaṃ dvitīyaṃ yajati /	In the second place he offers to Narâsamsa.[paragraph continues] Now, Narâsamsa is the air.
antarikṣaṃ vai narāśaṃsaḥ prajā vai narastā imā antarikṣamanu vāvadyamānāḥ prajāścaranti yadvai vadati śaṃsatīti vai tadāhustasmādantarikṣaṃ narāśaṃso 'ntarikṣamu vai triṣṭuptattriṣṭubhaṃ dvitīyāmakurvan //	Man (nara), namely, means (human) being; and these same beings move about in the air speaking aloud. And when he (man) speaks, they say 'he chants (sams);' and therefore Narâsamsa is the air . But the trishtubh also is the air , and for this reason they have placed the trishtubh second.
athāgniruttamaḥ /	Then Agni is the last (to whom offering is made).
gāyatrī vā agnistadgāyatrīmuttamāmakurvannevaṃ yathāyathena kLptena candāṃsi pratyatiṣṭhaṃstasmādidamapāpavasyasam //	Agni assuredly is the gâyatrî; and therefore they placed the gâyatrî last. In this way they established the metres in complete and proper order; and hence no confusion here takes place.
devānyajetyevādhvaryurāha /	The Adhvaryu says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer (yâgyâ) to the gods!' and the Hotri (begins his prayer) at all (the three offerings) with 'The divine . .
devaṃ-devamiti sarveṣu hotā devānāṃ vai devāḥ santi candāṃsyeva paśavo hyeṣāṃ gṛhā hi paśavaḥ pratiṣṭho hi gṛhāścandāṃsi vā anuyājāstasmāddevānyajetyevādhvaryurāha devaṃ-devamiti sarveṣu hotā //	.' For the metres assuredly are the gods of the gods, since they are their cattle, and cattle means a home, and a home is a safe resting-place. The after-offerings, doubtless, are the metres: therefore the Adhvaryu says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods!' and at all of them the Hotri begins with 'The divine .
vasuvane vasudheyasyeti /	. . .'
devatāyā eva vaṣaṭkriyate devatāyai hūyate na vā atra devatāstyanuyājeṣu devam barhiriti tatra nāgnirnendro na somo devo narāśaṃsa iti ṛta ekaṃ cana yo vā atrāgnirgāyatrī sa nidānena //	When he says 'The divine Barhis,' in this there is neither Agni, nor Indra, nor Soma; when he says 'The divine Narâsamsa,' neither is there in this anything whatever (of the nature of a god); and what Agni there is (in the third offering-prayer), he indeed is virtually the gâyatrî.
atha yadvasuvane vasudheyasyeti yajati / agnirvai vasuvanirindro vasudheyo 'sti vai candasāṃ devatendrāgnī evaivamu haitaddevatāyā eva vaṣaṭkriyate devatāyai hūyate //	The reason, then, why he offers with the formula 'for abundant obtainment of abundant gift ,'is that Agni is the obtainer of wealth, and Indra is the recipient of wealth; and Indra and Agni are indeed the (joint) divinity of the metres: and in this way it is for a deity that the vashat is pronounced, and to a deity that the offering is made.
athottamamanuyājamiṣṭvā samānīya juhoti /	After he has made the last after-offering, he pours together (the butter which remains in the upabhrit with that which attaches to the guhû), and offers it (by pouring it from the guhû in a line from west to east into the fire).
prayājānuyājā vā ete tadyathaivādaḥ prayājeṣu yajamānāya dviṣantam bhrātṛvyam baliṃ hārayatyattra ādyam baliṃ hārayatyevamevaitadanuyājeṣu baliṃ hārayati //	For doubtless these are the after-offerings to the fore-offerings: hence even as there, at the fore-offerings , he makes the spiteful enemy pay tribute to the sacrificer, and the one to be consumed pay tribute to the consumer; so now he makes him pay tribute at the after-offerings.
agnīṣomayorujjitimanūjjeṣaṃ vājasya mā prasavena prohāmīti juhūm prācīṃ dakṣiṇena pāṇināgnīṣomau tamapanudatāṃ yo smāndveṣṭi yaṃ ca vayaṃ dviṣmo vājasyainaṃ prasavenāpohāmītyupabhṛtam pratīcīṃ savyena pāṇinā yadi svayaṃ yajamānaḥ //	He now separates the two spoons (guhû and upabhrit), with the text , 'May I be victorious after the victory of Agni and Soma! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I urge myself on.' With his right hand he moves the guhû eastwards (from its usual place on the prastara-bunch upon the altar), with the text (ib. b), 'May Agni and Soma drive him away who hates us, and whomwe hate! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I drive him away.' With his left hand he moves the upabhrit westwards (from its place on the barhis to outside the altar):--Thus, if the sacrificer himself (does it) .
agnīṣomayorujjitimanūjjayatvayaṃ yajamāno vājasyainam prasavena prohāmyagnīṣomau tamapanudatāṃ yamayaṃ yajamāno dveṣṭi yaścainaṃ dveṣṭi vājasyainam prasavenāpohāmīti paurṇamāsyāmagnīṣomīyaṃ hi paurṇamāsaṃ havirbhavati //	And if the Adhvaryu (does it, he says), 'May this sacrificer be victorious after the victory of Agni and Soma! with the impetus of the food I urge him on;' and, 'May Agni and Soma drive him away whom this sacrificer hates, and who hates him! with the impetus of the food I drive him away.' Thus he does at the full-moon sacrifice, because the full-moon offering belongs to Agni and Soma.
athāmāvāsyāyām /	At the new-moon sacrifice, on the other hand, he uses the texts (ib.
indrāgnyorujjitimanūjjeṣaṃ vājasya mā prasavena prohāmīndrāgnī tamapanudatāṃ yo 'smāndveṣṭi yaṃ ca vayaṃ dviṣmo vājasyainam prasavenāpohāmīti yadi svayaṃ yajamānaḥ //	c, d), 'May I be victorious after the victory of Indra and Agni ! with the impetus of the food I urge myself on;' and, 'May Indra and Agni drive him away who hates us, and whom we hate! with the impetus of the food I drive him away:'--Thus, if the sacrificer himself does it.
indrāgnyorujjitimanūjjayatvayaṃ yajamāno vājasyainam prasavena prohāmīndrāgnī tamapanudatāṃ yamayaṃ yajamāno dveṣṭi yaścainaṃ dveṣṭi vājasyainam prasavenāpohāmītyamāvāsyāyāmaindrāgnaṃ hyāmāvāsyaṃ havirbhavatyevaṃ yathādevataṃ vyūhati tadyadevaṃ vyūhati //	And if the Adhvaryu (does it, he says), 'May this sacrificer be victorious after the victory of Indra and Agni! with the impetus of the food I urge him on;' and, 'May Indra and Agni drive him away whom this sacrificer hates, and who hates him! with the impetus of the food I drive him away.' Thus he says at the new-moon sacrifice, because the new-moonoffering belongs to Indra and Agni. And in this manner he separates (the spoons) according to the respective deities, This is why he thus separates them:
yo 'smā arātīyati sa upabhṛtamanu prāñcamevaitadyajamānamudūhatyapāñcaṃ tamapohati yo 'smā arātīyatyattaiva juhūmanvādya upabhṛtamanu prāñcamevaitadattāramudūhatyapāñcamādyamapohati //	Behind the guhû stands the sacrificer, and behind the upabhrit stands he who means evil to him: hereby, then, he brings the sacrificer forward to the front (or east), and the one who means evil him he drives back (or towards the west). Behind the guhû stands the eater (enjoyer), and behind the upabhrit the one to be eaten (enjoyed): thus he now brings the eater (enjoyer) to the front, and the one to be eaten (enjoyed) he drives back.
tadvā etat / samāna eva karmanvyākriyate tasmādu samānādeva puruṣādattā cādyaśca jāyate idaṃ hi caturthe puruṣe tṛtīye saṃgacāmaha iti videvaṃ dīvyamānā jātyā āsata etasmādu tat //	Thus the separation (of the eater and the eaten) is effected in one and the same act; and hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer (the husband), and the one to be enjoyed (the wife): for now kinsfolk (gâtyâh) live sporting and rejoicing together, saying, 'In the fourth (or) third man (I.e. generation) we unite .' And this is so in accordance with that (separation of the spoons).
atha juhvā paridhīntsamanakti /	Thereupon (the Adhvaryu) anoints the enclosing-sticks (paridhi) with (the butter attaching to) the guhû.
yayā devebhyo 'hauṣīdyayā yajñaṃ samatiṣṭhapattayaivaitatparidhīnprīṇāti tasmājjuhvā paridhīntsamanakti //	With that (spoon) with which he has made offering to the gods, with which he has concluded the sacrifice, he thus gratifies the enclosing-sticks: this is why he anoints them with the guhû.
sa samanakti vasubhyastvā rudrebhyastvādityebhyastvetyete vai trayā devā yadvasavo rudrā ādityā etebhyastvetyevaitadāha //	He anoints them (successively) , with the texts , 'For the Vasus thee!' 'For the Rudras thee!' 'For the Âdityas thee!' For these--to wit, the Vasus, Rudras, and Âdityas--are three (classes of) gods: 'for them (I anoint) thee,' he thereby says.
atha paridhimabhipadyāśrāvayati /	by touching the paridhi) it is for the enclosing-sticks that he calls for the sraushat.
paridhibhyo hyetadāśrāvayati yajño vā āśrāvaṇaṃ yajñenaivaitatpratyakṣam paridhīnprīṇāti tasmātparidhimabhipadyāśrāvayati //	The sraushat-call assuredly is the sacrifice: hence he thereby expressly gladdens the enclosing-sticks by means of the sacrifice: for this reason he calls for the sraushat, while taking hold of the enclosing-stick.

[He continues], '--for the proclamation of success ,'--for on this the gods themselves are indeed intent, to wit, that they should speak what is favourable (conducive to success, sâdhu), that they should do what is favourable: hence he says 'for the proclamation of success.'--'The human one is called upon for the song of praise (sûktavâka) !' by these words he urges on this human Hotri to singing praises.
atha prastaramādatte /	He now takes the prastara-bunch .

Now it is to the world of the gods that his sacrifice went; and to the world of the gods accordingly he thereby takes the sacrificer.

Now he that rules over the rain is undoubtedly that blowing one (Vâyu, the wind); and he, it is true, blows as one only; but, on entering into man, he becomes a forward and a backward moving one; and they are these two, the out-breathing and the in-breathing. And Mitra and Varuna assuredly are the out-breathing and in-breathing; and hence he says by that (prayer), 'may he who rules over the rain favour thee with rain!' Let him then take it up, with this text, for then the rain will at all times be propitious. He anoints it (the prastara): thereby he makes him (the sacrificer) an oblation, thinking, 'May he, as an oblation, go to the world of the gods!'
madhyamupabhṛti mūlaṃ dhruvāyāmagramiva hi juhūrmadhyamivopabhṛnmūlamiva dhruvā //	He anoints the top (of the prastara with the butter) in the guhû, the middle part (with that) in the upabhrit, and the lower end (with that) in the dhruvâ; for the guhû is, as it were, the top, the upabhrit the middle, and the dhruvâ the root.

He thereby causes it (the prastara and hence symbolically the sacrificer) to be a bird and fly up from this world of men to the world of the gods. He then draws it twice (towards the Âhavanîya) alow (near the ground). The reason why he must draw it alow (is this): the prastara is the sacrificer; and in this way he does not remove him from this firm footing of his; and he, moreover, secures rain for this locality.

He means to say, 'Go to the world of the gods,' when he says, 'Go to the spotted (mares) of the Maruts !'--'Having become a spotted cow, go to the sky and thence bring us rain hither!' The spotted cow, doubtless, is this (earth): whatever rooted and rootless food is here on this (earth), by that this (earth) is a spotted cow. 'Having becomethis (earth), go thou to the sky!' this is what he thereby says. 'Thence bring us rain hither!' From rain certainly spring vigour, sap, well-being: for this reason he says, 'thence bring us rain hither!

In this way, however, the sacrificer will live long; and what the full measure of human life here on earth is, for that he takes this (single stalk) therefrom.

But were he not to throw it into the fire, he would cut off the sacrificer from (yonder) world.
tam prāñcamanusamasyati /	In this way, however, he does not cut off the sacrificer from (yonder) world.

With the fingers only they should smooth it down, not with pieces of wood; since it is with sticks that they pierce any other corpse. Fearing, lest they should treat it in the same way as any other corpse, they should smooth it down with the fingers only, not with pieces of wood.

In this way also he does not throw himself into the fire after (the prastara or sacrificer).

[The Adhvaryu asks], 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnîdh?' whereby he says, 'Has he really gone?'--'He has gone!' replies the other.--'Bid (the gods) hear!' by these words he (the Adhvaryu) means to say, 'Make him (the sacrificer) be heard, make him be noticed by the gods!'--'May (one or they) hear (sraushat)!' thereby he (the Âgnîdhra) means to say, 'They know him, they have recognised him.' Thus the Adhvaryu and the Âgnîdhra lead the sacrificer to the world of the gods.

The divine Hotris assuredly are these enclosing-sticks, since these are Agnis (fires): it is to them that he thereby bids good-speed, and therefore he says, 'good-speed to thedivine Hotris!'--'Success (svasti) to the human!' thereby he desires that this human Hotri may not fail.

The middle enclosing-stick he throws first, with the text , 'The stick which thou laidst around thee, O divine Agni, when thou wert concealed by the Panis, I bring thee for thy pleasure; may it not prove faithless to thee!'--With (ib. b), 'Approach ye the place beloved of Agni!' he throws the two others after it.

Now when he takes that sacrificial food, the (residue of) butter, he does not announce it to any one deity; and hence he takes up (the two spoons) for the Visve Devâh, and thus makes that (residue of butter) the vaisvadeva at the haviryagña.

Svâhâ! Vât !' as one offers what has been consecrated by 'vashat,' this (residue) thereby becomes such for him (the sacrificer).

For him, on the other hand, for whom they take it from a jar, (they unyoke the spoons, by placing them) on the wooden sword, thinking, 'Where we yoke, there we also unyoke;' for from the same place where they yoke, they also unyoke.

At the Svishtakrit these two undergo an unyoking: he then lays them down, and so unyokes them. He then yokes them again, at the after-offerings. Having performed the after-offerings, he effects another unyoking: he lays them down, and so unyokes them. Thereupon he yokes them again when he seizes them both at the same time; and when he has travelled over the way for which he has yoked them, he unyokes them.

Now when (the Adhvaryu) says, 'The divine Hotris are summoned for the proclamation of success,the human one is called upon for the song of praise (sûkta-vâka);' and when the Hotri thereupon recites, he recites good words only : he thereby invokes a blessing on the sacrificer.

He (the Hotri) now invokes a blessing; and that blessing invoked by him, the sacrifice, on its part, realises for this (sacrificer), knowing as it does that he has produced it. For this reason he invokes a blessing after the sacrifice.

With 'has graciously accepted' the thus enumerates those deities to whom offering has been made: in saying 'Such a one has graciously accepted the oblation, such a one has graciously accepted the oblation,' he accordingly prays for the accomplishment of the sacrifice; for whatever oblation the gods graciously accept, by that he gains great things: hence he says, '(he) has graciously accepted it.' And '(he) has grown in strength' he says, because what the gods delight in, they make mountain high: for this reason he says '(he) has increased.'

'May he prosper in this sacrifice which goes to the gods!' he thereby says, 'May he be successful in this sacrifice which goes to the gods.'--'Thus prays this sacrificer, N.N. ;' here he gives the name, and thereby makes him directly successful in his prayer.

He who proceeds in this way will ensure dominion. He may, however, say, 'He prays for future worship of the gods,' for thereby (he ensures) long life, offspring, cattle . 'He prays for more abundant offering,' thereby (he prays for) that same object.

Let him not, however, say this; for, surely, the benediction at the sacrifice is for the sacrificer: what then have the officiating priests to do with it? Whatever blessing the officiating priests invoke at the sacrifice, that is for the sacrificer only. On the other hand, whoever says, 'and may both heaven and earth guard me . . .,' does not establishthat blessing anywhere: let him therefore say, 'and may both heaven and earth guard this one.

idaṃ ca namo devebhya iti tadyajñasyaivaitatsaṃsthāṃ gatvā namo devebhyaḥ karoti tasmādāhedaṃ ca namo devebhya iti //	'And this adoration (shall be offered) to the gods!' having attained the completion of the sacrifice, he thereby renders adoration to the gods: for this reason he says, 'and this adoration to the gods!'
atha śamyorāha /	Thereupon he pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing' (sam-yos) .
śamyurha vai bārhaspatyo 'ñjasā yajñasya saṃsthāṃ vidāṃ cakāra sa devalokamapīyāya tattadantarhitamiva manuṣyebhya āsa //	Now it was Samyu Bârhaspatya who perceived, in its true nature, the consummation of the sacrifice. He went to share in the world of the gods.
tadvā ṛṣīṇāmanuśrutamāsa /	Thereupon that (knowledge) was entirely lost to men.

By pronouncing the samyoh, they attained to that same consummation of the sacrifice which Samyu Bârhaspatya had perceived; and to that same consummation of the sacrifice, which Samyu Bârhaspatya had perceived, this (Hotri)attains by pronouncing the sam-yoh.
sa pratipadyate /	For this reason he pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing.'
tacaṃyorāvṛṇīmaha iti tāṃ yajñasya saṃsthāmāvṛṇīmahe yāṃ śamyurbārhaspatyo 'vedityevaitadāha //	He intones, 'We long for that All-hail and blessing (sam-yoh);' whereby he says, 'We long for that consummation of the sacrifice which Samyu Bârhaspatya perceived.

Having now attained the consummation of the sacrifice, he bids All-hail to this (sacrificer), and for this reason he says, 'All-hail, for us, to the two-footed, all-hail to the four-footed!'
athānayetyupaspṛśati /	He then touches (the earth) thus with this (finger) .
amānuṣa iva vā etadbhavati yadārtvijye pravṛta iyaṃ vai pṛthivī pratiṣṭhā tadasyāmevaitatpratiṣṭhāyām pratiṣṭhati tadu khalu punarmānuṣo bhavati tasmādanayetyupaspṛśati //	Non-human, verily, he becomes at thetime when he is chosen for the office of sacrificial priest; and, this earth being a safe standing-place, he thereby (viz. by touching the earth) stands on this safe standing-place; and he thereby also again becomes human: for this reason he thus touches (the earth) with this (finger).
te vai patnīḥ saṃyājayiṣyantaḥ pratiparāyanti /	Being about to perform the patnîsamyâgas , they betake themselves back to the Gârhapatya fire.
juhūṃ ca sruvaṃ cādhvaryurādatte vedaṃ hotājyavilāpanīmagnīt //	The Adhvaryu takes the guhû and sruva, the Hotri the veda, and the Âgnîdhra the butter-(melting) pot.
taddhaikeṣāmadhvaryuḥ / pūrveṇāhavanīyam paryeti tadu tathā na kuryādbahirdhā ha yajñātsyādyatteneyāt //	Here now the Adhvaryu, according to some, passes the Âhavanîya on the east side. Let him not, however, do this; for were he to walk on that side, he would be outside the sacrifice.
jaghaneno haiva patnīṃ /	According to others, the Adhvaryu walks (so as to pass) behind the (sacrificer's) wife .
ekeṣāmadhvaryureti no eva tathā kuryātpūrvārdho vai yajñasyādhvaryurjaghanārdhaḥ patnī yathā bhasattaḥ śiraḥ pratidadhyādevaṃ tadbahirdhā haiva yajñātsyādyatteneyāt //	Let him not, however, do this either; for verily the Adhvaryu is the fore-part, and the wife is the hind-part of the sacrifice: hence, if he were to pass so, it would be as if one were to put his head behind; and he (the Adhvaryu) would be outside the sacrifice.
antareṇo haiva patnīṃ /	According to others, the Adhvaryu passes between the wife (and the Gârhapatya fire).
ekeṣāmadhvaryureti no eva tathā kuryādantariyāddha yajñātpatnīṃ yatteneyāttasmādu pūrveṇaiva gārhapatyamantareṇāhavanīyaṃ caiti tathā ha na bahirdhā yajñādbhavati yatho evādaḥ pracarannantareṇa saṃcarati sa u evāsyaiṣa saṃcaro bhavati //	Let him not, however, do this either; for were he to pass that way, he would cut off the wife from the sacrifice. Along the east side of the Gârhapatya and the inner side of the Âhavanîya (he passes); for thus he is not outside the sacrifice; and as before, in walking forward (to the Âhavanîya), he passed along the inner side, so he now also takes that path.
atha patnīḥ saṃyājayanti /	They now perform the patnîsamyâgas.
yajñādvai prajāḥ prajāyante yajñātprajāyamānā mithunātprajāyante mithunātprajāyamānā antato yajñasya prajāyante tadenā etadantato yajñasya mithunātprajananātprajanayati tasmānmithunātprajananādantato yajñasyemāḥ prajāḥ prajāyante tasmātpatnīḥ saṃyājayanti //	From the sacrifice offspring is assuredly produced; and (that offspring) produced from the sacrifice is produced from union; and (the offspring) produced from union is produced after (in consequence of) the completion of the sacrifice: hence one thereby (i.e. by the patnîsamyâgas) causes that (offspring) to be produced by means of a productive union after the completion of the sacrifice. And so now also offspring is produced by means of a productive union after the completion of the sacrifice. This is why they now perform the patnîsamyâgas.
catasro devatā yajati /	He makes offering to four deities.
catasro vai mithunaṃ dvandvaṃ vai mithunaṃ dve dve hi khalu bhavato mithunamevaitatprajanane kriyate tasmāccatasro devatā yajati //	Four doubtless means a couple; for a couple means a pair (dvandva, lit. two and two), and two and two indeed they are: thus a productive union is thereby effected; and accordingly he makes offering to four deities.
tā vā ājyahaviṣo bhavanti /	He makes (the offerings) of butter for sacrificial food.
reto vā ājyaṃ reta evaitatsiñcati tasmādājyahaviṣo bhavanti //	Butter indeed means seed: hence he thereby scatters seed, and therefore makes them of butter for sacrificial food.
tenopāṃśu caranti /	In a low voice they engage in this (performance) .
tira iva vai mithunena caryate tira ivaitadyadupāṃśu tasmādupāṃśu caranti //	Secretly, doubtless, union takes place; and secretly also (takes place) what (is spoken) in a low voice: this is why they perform in a low voice.
atha somaṃ yajati /	He first makes offering to Soma.
reto vai somo reta evaitatsiñcati tasmātsomaṃ yajati //	Soma indeed means seed; hence he thereby scatters seed: this is why he makes offering to Soma.
atha tvaṣṭāraṃ yajati /	He then makes offering to Tvashtri.
