cūtaśākhāṃ kusumitāṃ pragṛhyānyā lalaṃbire | suvarṇakalaśaprakhyān darśayaṃtyaḥ payodharān ||	Others leaned, holding a mango-bough in full flower, displaying their bosoms like golden jars.

evamākṣipyamāṇo 'pi sa tu dhairyāvṛteṃdriyaḥ | martavyamiti sodvego na jaharṣa na sismiye ||	But although thus attacked, he, having his senses guarded by self-control, neither rejoiced nor smiled, thinking anxiously, ‘One must die.’
tāsāṃ tattvena vasthānaṃ dṛṣṭvā sa puruṣottamaḥ | sasaṃvignena dhīreṇa ciṃtayāmāsa cetasā ||	Having seen them in their real condition,  that best of men pondered with an undisturbed,  and stedfast mind.
kiṃ vinā nāvagacchaṃti capalaṃ yauvanaṃ striyaḥ | yato rūpeṇa saṃpannaṃ jareyaṃ nāśayiṣyati ||	‘What is it that these women lack  that they perceive not that youth is fickle? for this old age will destroy whatever has beauty.

ahitāt pratiṣedhaśca hite cānupravartanam | vyasane cāparityāgastrividhaṃ mitralakṣaṇam ||	‘To hinder from what is disadvantageous, to urge to what is advantageous — and not to forsake in misfortune, — these are the three marks of a friend.
so 'haṃ maitrīṃ pratijñāya puruṣārthātparāṅmukham | yadi tvāṃ samupekṣeyaṃ na bhavenmitratā mayi ||	‘If I, after having promised my friendship, were not to heed when thou turnest away from the great end of man, there would be no friendship in me.
tadbravīmi suhṛdbhūtvā taruṇasya vapuṣmataḥ | idaṃ na pratirūpaṃ te strīṣvadākṣiṇyamīdṛśam ||	‘Therefore I speak as thy friend, — such rudeness as this to women is not befitting for one young in years and graceful in person.
anṛtenāpi nārīṇāṃ yuktaṃ samanuvartanam | tadvrīḍāparihārārthamātmaratyarthameva ca ||	‘It is right to woo a woman even by guile, this is useful both for getting rid of shame and for one’s own enjoyment.
saṃnatiscānuvṛttiśca strīṇāṃ hṛdayabaṃdhanam | snehasya hi guṇā yonirmānakāmāśca yoṣitaḥ ||	‘Reverential behaviour and compliance with her wishes are what binds a woman’s heart; good qualities truly are a cause of love, and women love respect.
tadarhasi viśālākṣa hṛdaye 'pi parāṅmukhe | rūpasyāsyānurūpeṇa dākṣiṇyenānuvartitum ||	‘Wilt thou not then, O large-eyed prince, even if thy heart is unwilling, seek to please them with a courtesy worthy of this beauty of thine?
dākṣiṇyamauṣadhaṃ strīṇāṃ dākṣiṇyaṃ bhūṣaṇaṃ param | dākṣiṇyarahitaṃ rūpaṃ niṣpuṣpamiva kānanam ||	‘Courtesy is the balm of women, courtesy is the best ornament; beauty without courtesy is like a grove without flowers.
kiṃ vā dākṣiṇyamātreṇa bhāvenāstu parigrahaḥ | viṣayān durlabhāṃllabdhvā na hyavajñātumarhasi ||	‘But of what use is courtesy by itself? let it be assisted by the heart’s feelings; surely, when worldly objects so hard to attain are in thy grasp, thou wilt not despise them.
kāmaṃ paramiti jñātvā devo 'pi hi puraṃdaraḥ | gautamasya muneḥ patnīmahalyāṃ cakame purā ||	‘Knowing that pleasure was the best of objects, even the god Puraṃdara (Indra) wooed in olden time Ahalyā the wife of the saint Gautama.
agastyaḥ prārthayāmāsa somabhāryāṃ ca rohiṇīm | tasmāt tatsadṛśaṃ lebhe lopāmudrāmiti śrutiḥ ||	‘So too Agastya wooed Rohiṇī, the wife of Soma; and therefore, as Śruti saith, a like thing befell Lopāmudrā.

strīsaṃsargaṃ vināśāṃtaṃ pāṃḍurjñātvāpi kauravaḥ | mādrīrūpaguṇākṣiptaḥ siṣeve kāmajaṃ sukham ||	‘And the Kaurava king Pāṇḍu, though he knew that intercourse with his wife would end in death, yet overcome by the beauty and good qualities of Mādrī yielded to the pleasures of love.
karālajanakaścaiva hṛtvā brāhmaṇakanyakām | avāpa bhraṃśam apyeva na tu tyajecca manmatham ||	‘And so Karālajanaka, when he carried off the Brāhman’s daughter, incurred loss of caste thereby, but he would not give up his love.
evamādyā mahātmāno viṣayān garhitānapi | ratihetorbubhujire prāgeva guṇasaṃhitān ||	‘Great heroes such as these pursued even contemptible desires for the sake of pleasure, how much more so when they are praiseworthy of their kind?
tvaṃ punarnyāyataḥ prāptān balavān rūpavān yuvā | viṣayānavajānāsi yatra saktamidaṃ jagat ||	‘And yet thou, a young man, possessed of strength and beauty, despisest enjoyments which rightly belong to thee, and to which the whole world is devoted.’
iti śrutvā vacastasya ślakṣṇamāgamasaṃhitam | meghastanitanirghoṣaḥ kumāraḥ pratyabhāṣata ||	Having heard these specious words of his, well-supported by sacred tradition, the prince made reply, in a voice like the thundering of a cloud:
upapannamidaṃ vākyaṃ sauhārdavyaṃjakaṃ tvayi | atra ca tvānuneṣyāmi yatra mā duṣṭhu manyase ||	‘This speech manifesting affection is well-befitting in thee; but I will convince thee as to where thou wrongly judgest me.
nāvajānāmi viṣayāñjāne lokaṃ tadātmakam | anityaṃ tu jaganmatvā nātra me ramate manaḥ ||	‘I do not despise worldly objects, I know that all mankind are bound up therein; but remembering that the world is transitory, my mind cannot find pleasure in them.
jarā vyādhiśca mṛtyuśca yadi na syādidaṃ trayam | mamāpi hi manojñeṣu viṣayeṣu ratirbhavet ||	‘Old age, disease, and death — if these three things did not exist, I too should find my enjoyment in the objects that please the mind.
nityaṃ yadyapi hi strīṇāmetadeva vapurbhavet | sasaṃvitkasya kāmeṣu tathāpi na ratiḥ kṣamā ||	‘Yet even though this beauty of women were to remain perpetual, still delight in the pleasures of desire would not be worthy of the wise man.
yadā tu jarayā pītaṃ rūpamāsāṃ bhaviṣyati | ātmano 'pyanabhipretaṃ mohāttatra ratirbhavet ||	‘But since their beauty will be drunk up by old age, to delight therein through infatuation cannot be a thing approved even by thyself.
mṛtyuvyādhijarādharmo mṛtyuvyādhijarātmabhiḥ | ramamāṇo 'pyasaṃvignaḥ samāno mṛgapakṣibhiḥ ||	‘He who himself subject to death, disease, and old age, can sport undisturbed with those whose very nature implies death, disease, and old age, such a man is on a level with birds and beasts.
yadapyāttha mahātmānaste 'pi kāmātmakā iti | saṃvego 'tra na kartavyo yadā teṣāmapi kṣayaḥ ||	‘And as for what thou sayest as to even those great men having become victims to desire, do not be bewildered by them, for destruction was also their lot.
māhātmyaṃ na ca tanmanye yatra sāmānyataḥ kṣayaḥ | viṣayeṣu prasaktirvā yuktirvā nātmavattayā ||	‘Real greatness is not to be found there, where there is universally destruction, or where there is attachment to earthly objects, or a want of self-control.
yadapyātthānṛtenāpi strījane vartyatāmiti | anṛtaṃ nāvagacchāmi dākṣiṇyenāpi kiṃcana ||	‘And when thou sayest, “Let one deal with women even by guile,” I know nought about guile, even if it be accompanied with courtesy.
na cānuvartanaṃ tanme rucitaṃ yatra nārjavam | sarvabhāvena saṃparko yadi nāsti dhigastu tat ||	‘That compliance too with a woman’s wishes pleases me not, if truthfulness be not there; if there be not a union with one’s whole soul and nature, then “out upon it” say I.
anṛte śraddadhānasya saktasyādoṣadarśinaḥ | kiṃ hi vaṃcayitavyaṃ syājjātarāgasya cetasaḥ ||	‘A soul overpowered by passion, believing in falsehood, carried away by attachment and blind to the faults of its objects, — what is there in it worth being deceived?
vaṃcayaṃti ca yadyeva jātarāgāḥ parasparam | nanu naiva kṣamaṃ draṣṭuṃ narāḥ strīṇāṃ nṛṇām striyaḥ ||	‘And if the victims of passion do deceive one another, — are not men unfit for women to look at and women for men?
tadevaṃ sati duḥkhārttaṃ jarāmaraṇabhoginam | na māṃ kāmeṣvanāryeṣu pratārayitumarhasi ||	Since then these things are so, thou surely wouldest not lead me astray into ignoble pleasures, — me afflicted by sorrow, and subject to old age and death?
aho 'tidhīraṃ balavacca te manaścaleṣu kāmeṣu ca sāradarśinaḥ | bhaye 'pi tīvre viṣayeṣu sajjase nirīkṣamāṇo maraṇādhvani prajāḥ ||	‘Ah! thy mind must be very firm and strong, if thou canst find substance in the transitory pleasures of sense; even in the midst of violent alarm thou canst cling to worldly objects, when thou seest all created beings in the road of death.
ahaṃ punarbhīruratīvaviklavo jarāvipadvyādhibhayaṃ viciṃtayan | labhe na śāṃtiṃ na dhṛtiṃ kuto ratiṃ niśāmayan dīptamivāgninā jagat ||	‘But I am fearful and exceedingly bewildered, as I ponder the terrors of old age, death, and disease; I can find no peace, no self-command, much less can I find pleasure, while I see the world as it were ablaze with fire.
asaṃśayaṃ mṛtyuriti prajānato narasya rāgo hṛdi yasya jāyate | ayomayīṃ tasya paraimi cetanāṃ mahābhaye rakṣati yo na roditi ||	‘If desire arises in the heart of the man, who knows that death is certain, — I think that his soul must be made of iron, who restrains it in this great terror and does not weep.’
athau kumāraśca viniścayātmikāṃ cakāra kāmāśrayaghātinīṃ kathām | janasya cakṣurgamanīyamaṃḍalo mahīdharaṃ cāstamiyāya bhāskaraḥ ||	Then the prince uttered a discourse full of resolve and abolishing the objects of desire; and the lord of day, whose orb is the worthy centre of human eyes, departed to the Western Mountain.
tato vṛthādhāritabhūṣaṇasrajaḥ kalāguṇaiśca praṇayaiśca niṣphalaiḥ | sva eva bhāve vinigṛhya manmathaṃ puraṃ yayurbhagnamanorathāḥ striyaḥ ||	And the women, having worn their garlands and ornaments in vain, with their graceful arts and endearments all fruitless, concealing their love deep in their hearts,  returned to the city with broken hopes.
tataḥ purodyānagatāṃ janaśriyaṃ nirīkṣya sāyaṃ pratisaṃhṛtāṃ punaḥ | anityatāṃ sarvagatāṃ viciṃtayan viveśa dhiṣṇyaṃ kṣitipālakātmajaḥ ||	Having thus seen the beauty  of the troop of women who had gone out to the city-garden, now withdrawn in the evening, — the prince, pondering the transitoriness which envelopes all things, entered his dwelling.
tato mārabalaṃ jitvā dhairyeṇa ca śamena ca | paramārthaṃ vijijñāsuḥ sa dadhyau dhyānakovidaḥ ||	Then, having conquered the hosts of Māra by his firmness and calmness, he the great master of meditation set himself to meditate, longing to know the supreme end.
sarveṣu dhyānavidhiṣu prāpya caiśvaryamuttamam | sasmāra prathame yāme pūrvajanmaparaṃparām ||	And having attained the highest mastery in all kinds of meditation, he remembered in the first watch the continuous series of all his former births.
amutrāhamayaṃ nāma cyutastasmādihāgataḥ | iti janmasahasrāṇi sasmārānubhavanniva ||	‘In such a place I was so and so by name, and from thence I passed and came hither,’ thus he remembered his thousands of births, experiencing each as it were over again.
smṛtvā janma ca mṛtyuṃ ca tāsu tāsūpapattiṣu | tataḥ sattveṣu kāruṇyaṃ cakāra karuṇātmakaḥ ||	And having remembered each birth and each death in all those various transmigrations, the compassionate one then felt compassion for all living beings.
kṛtveha svajanotsargaṃ punaranyatra ca kriyāḥ | atrāṇaḥ khalu loko 'yaṃ paribhramati cakravat ||	Having wilfully rejected the good guides in this life and done all kinds of actions in various lives, this world of living beings rolls on helplessly, like a wheel.
ityevaṃ smaratastasya babhūva niyatātmanaḥ | kadalīgarbhaniḥsāraḥ saṃsāra iti niścayaḥ ||	As he thus remembered, to him in his strong self-control came the conviction, ‘All existence is insubstantial, like the fruit of a plantain.’
dvitīye tvāgate yāme so 'dvitīyaparākramaḥ | divyaṃ cakṣuḥ paraṃ lebhe sarvacakṣuṣmatāṃ varaḥ ||	When the second watch came, he, possessed of unequalled energy, received a pre-eminent divine sight, like the highest of all sight-gifted beings.
tatastena sa divyena pariśuddhena cakṣuṣā | dadarśa nikhilaṃ lokamādarśa iva nirmale ||	Then by that divine perfectly pure sight he beheld the whole world as in a spotless mirror.
sattvānāṃ paśyatastasya nikṛṣṭotkṛṣṭakarmaṇām | pracyutiṃ copapattiṃ ca vavṛdhe karuṇātmatā ||	As he saw the various transmigrations and rebirths of the various beings with their several lower or higher merits from their actions, compassion grew up more within him.
ime duṣkṛtakarmāṇaḥ prāṇino yāṃti durgatim | ime 'nye śubhakarmāṇaḥ pratiṣṭhaṃte tripiṣṭape ||	‘These living beings, under the influence of evil actions, pass into wretched worlds, — these others, under the influence of good actions, go forward in heaven.
upapannāḥ pratibhaye narake bhṛśadāruṇe | amī duḥkhairbahuvidhaiḥ pīḍyaṃte kṛpaṇaṃ vata ||	‘The one, being born in a dreadful hell full of terrors, are miserably tortured, alas! by many kinds of suffering;

sukhārthamaśubhaṃ kṛtvā ya ete bhṛśaduḥkhitāḥ | āsvādaḥ sa kimeteṣāṃ karoti sukhamaṇvapi ||	These who did something evil for the sake of pleasure and are now grievously pained, — does that old taste produce even an atom of pleasure to them now?
hasadbhiryatkṛtaṃ karma kaluṣaṃ kaluṣātmabhiḥ | etatpariṇate kāle krośadbhiranubhūyate ||	‘The wicked deed which was done by the wicked-hearted in glee, — its consequences are reaped by them in the fulness of time with cries.
yadyeva pāpakarmāṇaḥ paśyeyuḥ karmaṇāṃ phalam | vameyuruṣṇarudhiraṃ marmasvabhihatā iva ||	‘If only evil doers could see the fruits of their actions, they would vomit hot blood as if they were smitten in a vital part.

ataśca lolaṃ viṣayapradhānaṃ pramattamakṣāṃtamadīrghadarśi | bahucchalaṃ yauvanamabhyatītya nistīrya kāṃtāramivāśvasaṃti ||	‘Therefore having passed through the deceptive period of youth, fickle, intent on external objects, heedless, impatient, not looking at the distance, — they take breath like men who have escaped safe through a forest.
tasmādadhīraṃ capalapramādi navaṃ vayastāvadidaṃ vyapaitu | kāmasya pūrvaṃ hi vayaḥ śaravyaṃ na śakyate rakṣitumiṃdriyebhyaḥ ||	‘Let therefore this fickle time of youth first pass by, reckless and giddy, — our early years are the mark for pleasure, they cannot be kept from the power of the senses.

paṃthā hi niryātumayaṃ yaśasyo yo vāhitaḥ pūrvatamairnareṃdraiḥ | jātasya rājarṣikule viśāle bhaikṣākamaślāghyamidaṃ prapattum ||	‘That is a glorious path to travel, which has been followed by former leaders of men; this mendicant life is ill-suited for one born in the noble family of a royal sage to follow.
athādya nottiṣṭhasi niścitātmā bhava sthiro mā vimucaḥ pratijñām | mayodyato hyeṣa śaraḥ sa eva yaḥ sūryake mīnaripau vimuktaḥ ||	‘But if thou wilt not rise, strong in thy purpose, — then be firm if thou wilt and quit not thy resolve, — this arrow is uplifted by me, — it is the very one which was shot against Sūryaka,  the enemy of the fish.
pṛṣṭaḥ sa cānena kathaṃcidaiḍaḥ somasya naptāpyabhavadvicittaḥ | sa cābhavacchāṃtanurasvataṃtraḥ kṣīṇe yuge kiṃ vata durbalo 'nyaḥ ||	‘So too, I think, when somewhat probed by this weapon, even the son of Iḍā,  the grandson of the moon, became mad; and Sāntanu  also lost his self-control, — how much more then one of feebler powers now that the age has grown degenerate?
tatkṣipramuttiṣṭha labhasva saṃjñāṃ vāṇo hyayaṃ tiṣṭhati lelihānaḥ | priyābhidheyeṣu ratipriyeṣu yaṃ cakravākeṣvapi notsṛjāmi ||	‘Therefore quickly rise up and come to thyself - for this arrow is ready, darting out its tongue, which I do not launch even against the cakravāka birds, tenderly attached as they are and well deserving the name of lovers.’
ityevamukto 'pi yadā nirāstho naivāsanaṃ śākyamunirbibheda | śaraṃ tato 'smai visasarja māraḥ kanyāśca kṛtvā purataḥ sutāṃśca ||	But when, even though thus addressed, the Śākya saint unheeding did not change his posture, then Māra discharged his arrow at him, setting in front of him his daughters and his sons.
tasmiṃstu vāṇe 'pi sa vipramukte cakāra nāsthāṃ na dhṛteścacāla | dṛṣṭvā tathainaṃ viṣasāda māraściṃtāparītaśca śanairjagāda ||	But even when that arrow was shot he gave no heed and swerved not from his firmness; and Māra, beholding him thus, sank down, and slowly thus spoke, full of thought:
śaileṃdraputrīṃ prati yena viddho devo 'pi śaṃbhuścalito babhūva | na ciṃtayatyeṣa tameva vāṇaṃ kiṃ syādacitto na śaraḥ sa eṣaḥ ||	‘He does not even notice that arrow by which the god Śambhu was pierced with love for the daughter of the mountain  and shaken in his vow; can he be destitute of all feeling? is not this that very arrow?
tasmādayaṃ nārhati puṣpavāṇaṃ na harṣaṇaṃ nāpi raterniyogam | arhatyayaṃ bhūtagaṇairaśeṣaiḥ saṃtrāsanātarjanatāḍanāni ||	‘He is not worthy of my flower-shaft, nor my arrow “gladdener,” nor the sending of my daughter Rati (to tempt him); he deserves the alarms and rebukes and blows from all the gathered hosts of the demons.’

prakīrṇakeśāḥ śikhino 'rdhamuṃḍā rajjvaṃbarā vyākulaveṣṭanāśca | prahṛṣṭavaktrā bhṛkuṭīmukhāśca tejoharāścaiva manoharāśca ||	With dishevelled hair, or with topknots, or half-bald, with rope-garments or with head-dress all in confusion, — with triumphant faces or frowning faces, — wasting the strength or fascinating the mind.

viṣvagvavau vāyurudīrṇavegastārā na rejurna babhau śaśāṃkaḥ | tamaśca bhūyo vitatāra rātreḥ sarve ca saṃcukṣubhire samudrāḥ ||	A wind of intense violence blew in all directions,  the stars did not shine, the moon gave no light, and a deeper darkness of night spread around, and all the oceans were agitated.
mahībhṛto dharmaparāśca nāgā mahāmunervighnamamṛṣyamāṇāḥ | māraṃ prati krodhavivṛttanetrā niḥśaśvasuścaiva jajṛṃbhire ca ||	The mountain deities  and the Nāgas who honoured the Law, indignant at the attack on the saint, rolling their eyes in anger against Māra, heaved deep sighs and opened their mouths wide.
śuddhādhivāsā vibudharṣayastu saddharmasiddhyarthamiva pravṛttāḥ | māre 'nukaṃpāṃ manasā pracakrurvirāgabhāvāttu na roṣamīyuḥ ||	But the god-sages, the Śuddhādhivāsas,  being as it were absorbed in the perfect accomplishment of the good Law, felt only a pity for Māra in their minds and through their absolute passionlessness were unruffled by anger.

mahātmani tvayyupapannametat priyātithau tyāgini dharmakāme | sattvānvayajñānavayo 'nurūpā snigdhā yadevaṃ mayi te matiḥ syāt ||	‘This is indeed worthy of thee, great-souled as thou art, fond of guests, liberal and a lover of duty, — that thy mind should be thus kind towards me, in full accordance with thy nature, family, wisdom, and age.
etacca tadyena nṛparṣayaste dharmeṇa sūkṣmāṇi dhanānyapāsya | nityaṃ tyajaṃto vidhivadbabhūvustapobhirāḍhyā vibhavairdaridrāḥ ||	‘This is the true way in which those seer kings of old, rejecting through duty all trivial riches,  have ever flung them away as was right, — being poor in outward substance but rich in ascetic endurance.
prayojanaṃ yattu mamopayāne tanme śṛṇu prītimupehi ca tvam | divyā mayā divyapathe śrutā vāgbodhāya jātastanayastaveti ||	‘But hear now the motive for my coming and rejoice thereat; a heavenly voice has been heard by me in the heavenly path, that thy son has been born for the sake of supreme knowledge.
śrutvā vacastacca manaśca yuktvā jñātvā nimittaiśca tato 'smyupetaḥ | didṛkṣayā śākyakuladhvajasya śakradhvajasyeva samucchritasya ||	‘Having heard that voice and applied my mind thereto, and having known its truth by signs, I am now come hither, with a longing to see the banner of the Śākya race, as if it were Indra’s banner being set up.’
ityetadevaṃ vacanaṃ niśamya praharṣasaṃbhrāṃtagatirnareṃdraḥ | ādāya dhātryaṃkagataṃ kumāraṃ saṃdarśayāmāsa tapodhanāya ||	Having heard this address of his, the king, with his steps bewildered with joy, took the prince, who lay on his nurse’s side, and showed him to the holy ascetic.
cakrāṃkapādaṃ sa tathā mahārṣirjālāvanaddhāṃgulipāṇipādam | sorṇabhruvaṃ vāraṇavastikośaṃ savismayaṃ rājasutaṃ dadarśa ||	Thus the great seer beheld the king’s son with wonder, — his foot marked with a wheel, his fingers and toes webbed, with a circle of hair between his eyebrows, and signs of vigour like an elephant.
dhātryaṃkasaṃviṣṭamavekṣya cainaṃ devyaṃkasaṃviṣṭamivāgnisūnum | babhūva pakṣmāṃtarivāṃcitāśrurniśvasya caivaṃ tridivonmukho 'bhūt ||	Having beheld him seated on his nurse’s side, like the son of Agni (Skanda) seated on Devī’s side, he stood with the tears hanging on the ends of his eyelashes,  and sighing he looked up towards heaven.
dṛṣṭvāsitaṃ tvaśrupariplutākṣaṃ snehāttu putrasya nṛpaścakaṃpe | sagadgadaṃ bāṣpakaṣāyakaṃṭhaḥ papraccha ca prāṃjalirānatāṃgaḥ ||	But seeing Asita with his eyes thus filled with tears, the king was agitated through his love for his son, and with his hands clasped and his body bowed he thus asked him in a broken voice choked with weeping,
svalpāṃtaraṃ yasya vapurmuneḥ syādbahvadbhutaṃ yasya ca janma dīptam | yasyottamaṃ bhāvinamāttha cārthaṃ taṃ prekṣya kasmāttava dhīra vāṣpaḥ ||	‘One whose beauty has little to distinguish it from that of a divine sage,  and whose brilliant birth has been so wonderful, and for whom thou hast prophesied a transcendent future, — wherefore, on seeing him, do tears come to thee, O reverend one?
api sthirāyurbhagavan kumāraḥ kaccinna śokāya mama prasūtaḥ | labdhaḥ kathaṃcit salilāṃjalirme na khalvimaṃ pātumupaiti kālaḥ ||	‘Is the prince, O holy man, destined to a long life? Surely he cannot be born for my sorrow.  I have with difficulty obtained a handful of water, surely it is not death which comes to drink it.
apyakṣayaṃ me yaśaso nidhānaṃ kacciddhruvo me kulahastasāraḥ | api prayāsyāmi sukhaṃ paratra supte 'pi putre 'nimiṣaikacakṣuḥ ||	‘Tell me, is the hoard of my fame free from destruction? Is this chief prize of my family secure ? Shall I ever depart happily to another life, — I who keep one eye ever awake, even when my son is asleep?
kaccinna me jātamaphullameva kulaprabālaṃ pariśoṣabhāgi | kṣipraṃ vibho brūhi na me 'sti śāṃtiḥ snehaṃ sute vetsi hi bāṃdhavānām ||	‘Surely this young shoot of my family is not born barren, destined only to wither! Speak quickly, my lord, I cannot wait; thou well knowest the love of near kindred for a son.’
ityāgatāvegamaniṣṭabuddhyā buddhvā nareṃdraṃ sa* munirbabhāṣe | mā bhūnmatiste nṛpa kācidanyā niḥsaṃśayaṃ tadyadavocamasmi ||	Knowing the king to be thus agitated through his fear of some impending evil, the sage thus addressed him: ‘Let not thy mind, O monarch, be disturbed, — all that I have said is certainly true.
nāsyānyathātvaṃ prati vikriyā me svāṃ vaṃcanāṃ tu prati viklavo 'smi | kālo hi me yātumayaṃ ca jāto jātikṣayasyāsulabhasya boddhā ||	‘I have no feeling of fear as to his being subject to change, but I am distressed for mine own disappointment. It is my time to depart, and this child is now born, — he who knows that mystery hard to attain, the means of destroying birth.
vihāya rājyaṃ viṣayeṣvanāsthastīvraiḥ prayatnairadhigamya tattvam | jagatyayaṃ mohatamo nihaṃtuṃ jvaliṣyati jñānamayo hi sūryaḥ ||	Having forsaken his kingdom, indifferent to all worldly objects, and having attained the highest truth by strenuous efforts, he will shine forth as a sun of knowledge to destroy the darkness of illusion in the world.
duḥkhārṇavādvyādhivikīrṇaphenājjarātaraṃgānmaraṇogravegāt | uttārayiṣyatyayamuhyamānamārttaṃ jagajjñānamahāplavena ||	‘He will deliver by the boat of knowledge the distressed world, borne helplessly along, from the ocean of misery which throws up sickness as its foam, tossing with the waves of old age, and rushing with the dreadful onflow of death.
prajñāṃbuvegāṃ sthiraśīlavaprāṃ samādhiśītāṃ vratacakravākām | asyottamāṃ dharmanadīṃ pravṛttāṃ tṛṣṇārditaḥ pāsyati jīvalokaḥ ||	‘The thirsty world of living beings will drink the flowing stream of his Law, bursting forth with the water of wisdom, enclosed by the banks of strong moral rules, delightfully cool with contemplation, and filled with religious vows as with ruddy geese.
