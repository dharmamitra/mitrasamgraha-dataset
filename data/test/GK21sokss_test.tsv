sā ca citrarasanirbharā kathā vismṛtāmarakathā kutūhalāt / tadvidhāya nagare nirantarāṃ khyātimatra bhuvanatraye gatā //	Now that tale was so full of various interest that men were so taken with it as to forget the tales of the gods, and after producing that effect in the city it attained uninterrupted renown in the three worlds.
prathamas taraṅgaḥ / gaurīnavapariṣvaṅge vibhoḥ svedāmbu pātu vaḥ / netrāgnibhītyā kāmena vāruṇastramivāhitam //	[Additional note: The Paiśāchī language] INVOCATION MAY the water of Śiva’s sweat, fresh from the embrace of Gaurī,[1] which the God of Love when afraid of the fire of Śiva’s eye employs as his aqueous weapon, protect you.

asti vatsa iti khyāto deśo darpopaśāntaye / svargasya nirmito dhātrā pratimalla iva kṣitau //	Story of Udayana, King of Vatsa [M] (Main story line continued) There is a land[2] famous under the name of Vatsa, that appears as if it had been made by the Creator as an earthly rival to dash the pride of heaven.
kauśāmbī nāma tatrāsti madhyabhāge mahāpurī / lakṣmīvilāsavasatirbhūtalasyeva karṇikā //	In the centre of it is a great city named Kauśāmbī, the favourite dwelling-place of the Goddess of Prosperity;
tasyāṃ rājā śatānīkaḥ pāṇḍavānvayasaṃbhavaḥ / janamejayaputro 'bhūtpautro rājñaḥ parīkṣitaḥ //	In it dwelt a king named Śatānīka, sprung from the Pāṇḍava family; he was the son of Janamejaya, and the grandson of King Parīkṣit, who was the great-grandson of Abhimanyu.
abhimanyuprapautraśca yasyādipuruṣo 'rjunaḥ / tripurāribhujastambhadṛṣṭadordaṇḍavikramaḥ //	The first progenitor of his race was Arjuna, the might of whose strong arm was tested in a struggle with the mighty arms of Śiva[3];
kalatraṃ bhūrabhūttasya rājñī viṣṇumatī tathā / ekā ratnāni suṣuve na tāvadaparā sutam //	his wife was the earth, and also Viṣṇumatī his queen: the first produced jewels, but the second did not produce a son.
ekadā mṛgayāsaṅgādbhrāmyataścāsya bhūpateḥ / abhūcchāṇḍilyamuninā samaṃ paricayo vane //	Once on a time, as that king was roaming about in his passion for the chase, he made acquaintance in the forest with the hermit Śāṇḍilya.
so 'sya putrārthino rājñaḥ kauśāmbīmetya sādhitam / mantrapūtaṃ caruṃ rājñīṃ prāśayanmunisattamaḥ //	That worthy sage, finding out that the king desired a son, came to Kauśāmbī and administered to his queen an artfully prepared oblation[4] consecrated with mystic verses.
tatastasya suto jajñe sahasrānīkasaṃjñakaḥ / śuśubhe sa pitā tena vinayena guṇo yathā //	Then he had a son born to him called Sahasrānīka. And his father was adorned by him as excellence is by modesty.
yuvarājaṃ kramātkṛtvā śatānīko 'tha taṃ sutam / saṃbhogaireva rājābhūnna tu bhūbhāracintanaiḥ //	Then in course of time Śatānīka made that son crown prince and, though he still enjoyed kingly pleasures, ceased to trouble himself about the cares of government.
athāsuraiḥ samaṃ yuddhe prāpte sāhāyakecchayā / dūtastasmai visṛṣṭo 'bhūdrājñe śakreṇa mātaliḥ //	Then a war arose between the gods and Asuras, and Indra sent Mātali as a messenger to that king begging for aid.

asurān yamadaṃṣṭrādīn bahūn paśyati vāsave / hatvā tatraiva saṅgrāme prāpa mṛtyuṃ sa bhūpatiḥ //	That king, having slain many Asuras, of whom Yamadaṃṣṭra was the chief, under the eyes of Indra, met death in that very battle.
mātalyānītadehaṃ ca devī taṃ nṛpamanvagāt / rājalakṣmīśca tatputraṃ sahasrānīkamāśrayat //	The king’s body was brought back by Mātali, and the queen burnt herself with it, and the royal dignity descended to his son Sahasrānīka.
citraṃ tasminsamārūḍhe pitryaṃ siṃhāsanaṃ nṛpe / bhareṇa sarvato rājñāṃ śirāṃsi natimāyayuḥ //	Wonderful to say, when that king ascended his father’s throne the heads of the kings on every side of his dominions were bent down with the weight.
tataḥ śakraḥ suhṛtputraṃ vipakṣavijayotsave / svargaṃ sahasrānīkaṃ taṃ nināya preṣya mātalim //	Then Indra sent Mātali, and brought to heaven that Sahasrānīka, as being the son of his friend, that he might be present at the great feast which he was holding to celebrate his victory over his foes.
sa tatra nandane devān krīḍataḥ kāminīsakhān / dṛṣṭvā svocitabhāryārthī rājā śokam ivāviśat //	There the king saw the gods, attended by their fair ones, sporting in the garden of Nandana, and desiring for himself a suitable wife, fell into low spirits.
vijñāyaitamabhiprāyaṃ tamuvācātha vāsavaḥ / rājannalaṃ viṣādena vāñcheyaṃ tava setsyati //	Then Indra, perceiving this desire of his, said to him: “King, away with despondency; this desire of thine shall be accomplished.
utpannā hi kṣitau bhāryā tulyā te pūrvanirmitā / imaṃ ca śṛṇu vṛttāntamatra te varṇayāmyaham // purā pitāmahaṃ draṣṭumagacchaṃ tatsabhāmaham / vidhūmo nāma paścācca mamaiko vasurāgamat //	For there has been born upon the earth one who was long ago ordained a suitable match for thee. For listen to the following history, which I now proceed to relate to thee:— “Long ago I went to the Court of Brahmā in order to visit him, and a certain Vasu named Vidhūma followed me.
sthiteṣvasmāsu tatraiva viriñcaṃ draṣṭumapsarāḥ / āgādalambuṣā nāma vātavisraṃsitāṃśukā //	While we were there an Apsaras named Alambuṣā came to see Brahmā, and her robe was blown aside by the wind.
tāṃ dṛṣṭvaiva sa kāmasya vaśaṃ vasurupāgamat / sāpyapsarā jhagityāsīttadrūpākṛṣṭalocanā //	And the Vasu when he beheld her was overpowered by love, and the Apsaras too had her eyes immediately attracted by his form.
tad ālokya mamāpaśya nmukhaṃ kamalasaṃbhavaḥ / abhiprāyaṃ viditvāsya tāvahaṃ śaptavān krudhā // martyaloke 'vatāro 'stu yuvayoravinītayoḥ / bhaviṣyathaśca tatraiva yuvāṃ bhāryāpatī iti // sa vasustvaṃ samutpannaḥ sahasrānīkabhūpate / śatānīkasya tanayo bhūṣaṇaṃ śaśinaḥ kule //	The lotus-sprung god[5] when he beheld that looked me full in the face, and I, knowing his meaning, in wrath cursed those two: ‘Be born, you two shameless creatures, into the world of mortals, and there become man and wife.’ That Vasu has been born as thou, Sahasrānīka, the son of Śatānīka, an ornament to the race of the moon.
sāpyapsarā ayodhyāyāṃ kṛtavarmanṛpātmajā / jātā mṛgāvatī nāma sā te bhāryā bhaviṣyati // itīndravākyapavanairudbhūto hṛdi bhūpateḥ / sasnehe tasya jhagiti prājvalanmadanānalaḥ //	And that Apsaras too has been born in Ayodhyā as the daughter of King Kṛtavarman, Mṛgāvatī by name, she shall be thy wife.” By these words of Indra the flame of love was fanned in the passionate[6] heart of the king and burst out into full blaze;
tataḥ saṃmānya śakreṇa preṣitastadrathena saḥ / saha mātalinā rājā pratasthe svāṃ purīṃ prati //	Indra then dismissed the king from heaven with all due honour in his own chariot, and he set out with Mātali[7] for his capital.
gacchantaṃ cāpsarāḥ prītyā tamuvāca tilottamā / rājanvakṣyāmi te kiṃcitpratīkṣasva manāgiti //	But as he was starting the Apsaras Tilottamā said to him out of affection: “King, I have somewhat to say to thee;
tadaśrutvaiva hi yayau sa tāṃ dhyāyanmṛgāvatīm / tataḥ sā lajjitā kopāttaṃ śaśāpa tilottamā //	wait a moment.” But he, thinking on Mṛgāvatī, went off without hearing what she said;
yayā hṛtamanā rājan na śṛṇoṣi vaco mama / tasyāścaturdaśasamā viyogaste bhaviṣyati // mātalistacca śuśrāva sa ca rājā priyotsukaḥ / yayau rathena kauśāmbīmayodhyāṃ manasā punaḥ //	then Tilottamā in her rage cursed him: “King, thou shalt be separated for fourteen years from her who has so engrossed thy mind that thou dost not hear my speech.” Now Mātali heard that curse, but the king, yearning for his beloved, did not. In the chariot he went to Kauśāmbī, but in spirit he went to Ayodhyā.
tato yugaṃdharādibhyo mantribhyo vāsavācchrutam / mṛgāvatīgataṃ sarvaṃ śaśaṃsotsukayā dhiyā //	Then the king told with longing heart all that he had heard from Indra with reference to Mṛgāvatī to his ministers, Yogandhara and the others;
yācituṃ tāṃ sa kanyāṃ ca tatpituḥ kṛtavarmaṇaḥ / ayodhyāṃ prāhiṇoddūtaṃ kālakṣepāsaho nṛpaḥ //	and not being able to endure delay, he sent an ambassador to Ayodhyā to ask her father Kṛtavarman for the hand of that maiden.
kṛtavarmā ca taddūtācchrutvā saṃdeśamabhyadhāt / harṣāddevyai kalāvatyai tataḥ sāpyenamabravīt // rājan sahasrānīkāya deyāvaśyaṃ mṛgāvatī / imam arthaṃ ca me svapne jāne ko 'py avadad dvijaḥ // atha hṛṣṭo mṛgāvatyā nṛttagītādikauśalam / rūpaṃ cāpratimaṃ tasmai dūtāyādarśayan nṛpaḥ //	And Kṛtavarman having heard from the ambassador his commission, told in his joy the Queen Kalāvatī, and then she said to him: “King, we ought certainly to give Mṛgāvatī to Sahasrānīka, and, I remember, a certain Brāhman told me this very thing in a dream.” Then in his delight the king showed to the ambassador Mṛgāvatī’s wonderful skill in dancing, singing and other accomplishments, and her matchless beauty;
dadau tāṃ ca sa kāntānāṃ kalānām ekam āspadam / kṛtavarmā sutāṃ tasmai rājñe mūrtim ivaindavīm //	so the King Kṛtavarman gave to Sahasrānīka that daughter of his who was unequalled as a mine of graceful arts, and who shone like an incarnation of the moon.
parasparaguṇāvāptyai sa śrutaprajñayoriva / abhūt sahasrānīkasya mṛgāvatyāś ca saṃgamaḥ //	That marriage of Sahasrānīka and Mṛgāvatī was one in which the good qualities of either party supplemented those of the other, and might be compared to the union of learning and intelligence.
atha tasyācirādrājño mantriṇāṃ jajñire sutāḥ / jajñe yugaṃdharasyāpi putro yaugandharāyaṇaḥ //	Not long after sons were born to the king’s ministers; Yogandhara had a son born to him named Yaugandharāyaṇa;
supratīkasya putraśca rumaṇvānityajāyata / yo 'sya narmasuhṛttasya putro 'jani vasantakaḥ //	and Supratīka had a son born to him named Rumaṇvat. And to the king’s master of the revels was born a son named Vasantaka.
tatastasyāpi divasaiḥ sahasrānīkabhūpateḥ / babhāra garbhamāpāṇḍumukhī rājñī mṛgāvatī // yayāce sātha bhartāraṃ darśanātṛptalocanam / dohadaṃ rudhirāpūrṇalīlāvāpīnimajjanam //	Then in a few days Mṛgāvatī became slightly pale and promised to bear a child to King Sahasrānīka. And then she asked the king, who was never tired of looking at her, to gratify her longing[8] by filling a tank of blood for her to bathe in.
sa cecchāṃ pūrayan rājñyā lākṣādirasanirbharām / cakāra dhārmiko rājā vāpīṃ raktāvṛtām iva //	[also see notes on the magical properties of blood] Accordingly the king, who was a righteous man, in order to gratify her desire, had a tank filled with the juice of lac and other red extracts, so that it seemed to be full of blood.
tasyāṃ snāntīmakasmācca lākṣāliptāṃ nipatya tām / garuḍānvayajaḥ pakṣī jahārāmiṣaśaṅkayā //	And while she was bathing in that lake, and covered with red dye, a bird of the race of Garuḍa[9] suddenly pounced upon her and carried her off, thinking she was raw flesh.
pakṣiṇā kvāpi nītāṃ tāmanveṣṭumiva tatkṣaṇam / yayau sahasrānīkasya dhairyaṃ vihvalacetasā //	As soon as she was carried away in some unknown direction by the bird the king became distracted, and his self-command forsook him as if in order to go in search of her.
priyānuraktaṃ ceto 'pi nūnaṃ tasya patattriṇā / jahre yena sa niḥsaṃjñaḥ papāta bhuvi bhūpatiḥ // kṣaṇācca labdhasaṃjñe 'sminrājñi buddhvā prabhāvataḥ / avatīrya dyumārgeṇa tatra mātalirāyayau //	His heart was so attached to his beloved that it was in very truth carried off by that bird, and thus he fell senseless upon the earth. As soon as he had recovered his senses, Mātali, who had discovered all by his divine power, descended through the air and came where the king was.
sa rājānaṃ samāśvāsya sāvadhiṃ prāgyathā śrutam / tasmai tilottamāśāpaṃ kathayitvā tato 'gamat //	He consoled the king, and told him the curse of Tilottamā with its destined end, as he had heard it long ago, and then he took his departure.
hā priye pūrṇakāmā sā jātā pāpā tilottamā / ityādi ca sa śokārto vilalāpa mahīpatiḥ // vijñātaśāpavṛttānto bodhitaśca sa mantribhiḥ / kathaṃcijjīvitaṃ dadhne punaḥ saṃgamavāñchayā //	Then the king, tormented with grief, lamented on this wise: “Alas, my beloved, that wicked Tilottamā has accomplished her desire.” But having learned the facts about the curse, and having received advice from his ministers, he managed, though with difficulty, to retain his life through hope of a future reunion.
tāṃ ca rājñīṃ sa pakṣīndraḥ kṣaṇānnītvā mṛgāvatīm / jīvantīṃ vīkṣya tatyāja daivādudayaparvate //	But that bird which had carried off Mṛgāvatī, as soon as it found out that she was alive, abandoned her, and, as fate would have it, left her on the mountain where the sun rises.
tyaktvā tasmin gate cātha rājñī śokabhayākulā / dadarśānātham ātmānaṃ durgamādritaṭasthitam //	And when the bird let her drop and departed, the queen, distracted with grief and fear, saw that she was left unprotected on the slope of a trackless mountain.
ekākinīm ekavastrāṃ krandantīm atha tāṃ vane / grāsīkartuṃ pravṛtto 'bhūdutthāyājagaro mahān //	While she was weeping in the forest, alone, with only one garment to cover her, an enormous serpent rose up and prepared to swallow her.
nihatyājagaraṃ taṃ ca śubodarkā tathaiva sā / divyena mocitā puṃsāṃ dṛṣṭanaṣṭena kenacit //	Then she for whom prosperity was reserved in the future was delivered by some heavenly hero who came down and slew the serpent and disappeared almost as soon as he was seen.
tato vanagajasyāgre sā svayaṃ maraṇārthinī / ātmānamakṣipatso 'pi rarakṣa dayayeva tām //	Thereupon she, longing for death, flung herself down in front of a wild elephant, but even he spared her as if out of compassion.
citraṃ yacchvāpado 'pyenāṃ patitāmapi gocare / nāvadhīdathavā kiṃ hi na bhavedīśvarecchayā //	Wonderful was it that even a wild beast did not slay her when she fell in his way! Or rather it was not to be wondered at.
atha prapātābhimukhī bālā garbhabharālasā / smarantī taṃ ca bhartāraṃ muktakaṇṭhaṃ ruroda sā //	What cannot the will of Śiva effect? Then the girl, tardy with the weight of her womb, desiring to hurl herself down from a precipice, and thinking upon that lord of hers, wept aloud;
tacchrutvā muniputro 'tha tatraikastāṃ samāyayau / āgataḥ phalamūlārthaṃ śucaṃ mūrtimatīmiva //	and a hermit’s son, who had wandered there in search of roots and fruits, hearing that, came up, and found her looking like the incarnation of sorrow.
sa ca pṛṣṭvā yathāvṛttamāśvāsya ca kathaṃcana / jamadagnyāśramaṃ rājñīṃ nināyaināṃ dayārdradhīḥ //	And he, after questioning the queen about her adventures, and comforting her as well as he could, with a heart melted with compassion led her off to the hermitage of Jamadagni.
tatra mūrtamivāśvāsaṃ jamadagniṃ dadarśa sā / tejasā sthirabālārkaṃ kurvāṇamudayācalam //	There she beheld Jamadagni, looking like the incarnation of comfort, whose brightness so illumined the eastern mountain that it seemed as if the rising sun ever rested on it.
so 'pi tāṃ pādapatitāṃ munirāśritavatsalaḥ / rājñīṃ viyogaduḥkhārtāṃ divyadṛṣṭirabhāṣata // iha te janitā putri putro vaṃśadharaḥ pituḥ / bhaviṣyati ca bhartā te saṃgamo mā śucaṃ kṛthāḥ //	When she fell at his feet, that hermit who was kind to all who came to him for help, and possessed heavenly insight, said to her who was tortured with the pain of separation: “Here there shall be born to thee, my daughter, a son who shall uphold the family of his father, and thou shalt be reunited to thy husband;
ityuktā muninā sādhvī sā jagrāha mṛgāvatī / āśrame 'vasthitiṃ tasminnāśāṃ ca priyasaṃgame //	therefore weep not.” When that virtuous woman heard that speech of the hermit’s she took up her abode in that hermitage, and entertained hope of a reunion with her beloved.
tataśca divasaistatra ślāghanīyamaninditā / satsaṃgatirivācāraṃ putraratnamasūta sā //	And some days after the blameless one gave birth to a charmingly beautiful son, as association with the good produces good manners.
śrīmānudayano nāmnā rājā jāto mahāyaśāḥ / bhaviṣyati ca putro 'sya sarvavidyādharādhipaḥ // ity antarikṣād udabhūt tasmin kāle sarasvatī / ādadhānā mṛgāvatyāś cittavismṛtam utsavam //	At that moment a voice was heard from heaven: “An august king of great renown has been born, Udayana by name, and his son shall be monarch of all the Vidyādharas.” That voice restored to the heart of Mṛgāvatī joy which she had long forgotten.
kramādudayanaḥ so 'tha bālastasmiṃstapovane / avardhata nijaiḥ sārdhaṃ vayasyair iva sadguṇaiḥ //	Gradually that boy grew up to size and strength in that grove of asceticism, accompanied by his own excellent qualities as playmates.
kṛvā kṣatrocitānsarvānsaṃskārāñjamadagninā / vyanīyata sa vidyāsu dhanurvede ca vīryavān //	And the heroic child had the sacraments appropriate to a member of the warrior caste performed for him by Jamadagni, and was instructed by him in the sciences and the practice of archery.
kṛṣṭvā ca svakarānmātā tasya snehānmṛgāvatī / sahasrānīkanāmāṅkaṃ cakāra kaṭakaṃ kare //	And out of love for him Mṛgāvatī drew off from her own wrist, and placed on his, a bracelet marked with the name of Sahasrānīka.
hariṇākheṭake jātu bhrāmyannudayano 'tha saḥ / śabareṇa haṭhākrāntamaṭavyāṃ sarpamaikṣata // sadayaḥ sundare tasminsarpe taṃ śabaraṃ ca saḥ / uvāca mucyatāmeṣa sarpo madvacanāditi // tataḥ sa śabaro 'vādījjīvikeyaṃ mama prabho / kṛpaṇo 'haṃ hi jīvāmi bhujagaṃ khelayansadā //	Then that Udayana, roaming about once upon a time in pursuit of deer, beheld in the forest a snake that had been forcibly captured by a Śavara.[10] And he, feeling pity for the beautiful snake, said to that Śavara: “Let go this snake to please me.” Then that Śavara said: “My lord, this is my livelihood, for I am a poor man, and I always maintain myself by exhibiting dancing snakes.
vipanne pannage pūrvaṃ mantrauṣadhibalādayam / vaṣṭabdhaśca mayā labdhaś cinvataitāṃ mahāṭavīm // śrutvetyudayanasyāgī dattvāsmai śabarāya tam / kaṭakaṃ jananīdattaṃ sa taṃ sarpamamocayat //	The snake I previously had having died, I searched through the great wood, and finding this one, overpowered him by charms and captured him.” When he heard this, the generous Udayana gave that Śavara the bracelet which his mother had bestowed on him, and persuaded him to set the snake at liberty.
gṛhītakaṭake yāte śabare purato gatim / kṛtvā sa bhujagaḥ prīto jagādodayanaṃ tadā // vasunemiriti khyāto jyeṣṭho bhrātāsmi vāsukeḥ / imāṃ vīṇāṃ gṛhāṇa tvaṃ mattaḥ saṃrakṣitāttvayā // tantrīnirghoṣaramyāṃ ca śrutibhāgavibhājitām / tāmbūlīśca sahāmlānamālātilakayuktibhiḥ // tadyukto jamadagnestaṃ nāgotkṣiptaḥ sa cāśramam / āgādudayano māturdṛśi varṣannivāmṛtam //	The Śavara took the bracelet and departed, and then the snake, being pleased with Udayana, bowed before him and said as follows:— “I am the eldest brother of Vāsuki,[11] called Vasunemi: receive from me, whom thou hast preserved, this lute, sweet in the sounding of its strings, divided according to the division of the quarter-tones, and betel leaf, together with the art of weaving unfading garlands and adorning the forehead with marks that never become indistinct.” Then Udayana, furnished with all these, and dismissed by the snake, returned to the hermitage of Jamadagni, raining nectar, so to speak, into the eyes of his mother.
atrāntare sa śabaro 'pyaṭavīṃ prāpya paryaṭan / ādāyodayanātprāptaṃ kaṭakaṃ tadvidhervaśāt // vikrīṇānaśca tattatra rājanāmāṅkamāpaṇe / vaṣṭabhya rājapuruṣairninye rājakulaṃ ca saḥ //	[also see notes on snakes] In the meantime that Śavara who had lighted on this forest, and while roaming about in it had obtained the bracelet from Udayana by the will of fate, was caught attempting to sell this ornament, marked with the king’s name, in the market, and was arrested by the police, and brought up in court before the King.
kutastvayedaṃ kaṭakaṃ saṃprāptamiti tatra saḥ / rājñā sahasrānīkena svayaṃ śokād apṛcchata //	Then King Sahasrānīka himself asked him in sorrow whence he had obtained the bracelet.
athodayādrau sarpasya grahaṇātprabhṛti svakam / kaṭakaprāptivṛttāntaṃ śabaraḥ sa jagāda tam //	Then that Śavara told him the whole story of his obtaining possession of the bracelet, beginning with his capture of the snake upon the eastern mountain.
tadbuddhvā śabarāddṛṣṭvā dayitāvalayaṃ ca tam / vicāra dolām ārohat sahasrānīkabhūpatiḥ //	Hearing that from the Śavara, and beholding that bracelet of his beloved, King Sahasrānīka ascended the swing of doubt.
kṣīṇaḥ śāpaḥ sa te rājannudayādrau ca sā sthitā / jamadagnyāśrame jāyā saputrā te mṛgāvatī // iti divyā tadā vāṇī nandayāmāsa taṃ nṛpam / viprayoganidāghārtaṃ vāridhāreva barhiṇam // athotkaṇṭhādīrghe kathamapi dine 'sminnavasite tamevāgre kṛtvā śabaramaparedyuḥ sa nṛpatiḥ / sahasrānīkastāṃ sarabhasamavāptuṃ priyatamāṃ pratasthe tatsainyaiḥ samamudayaśailāśramapadam //	Then a divine voice from heaven delighted the king, who was tortured with the fire of separation, as do the raindrops the peacock when afflicted with the heat, uttering these words: “Thy curse is at an end, O king, and that wife of thine, Mṛgāvatī, is residing in the hermitage of Jamadagni together with thy son.” Then that day at last came to an end, though being made long by anxious expectation, and on the morrow that King Sahasrānīka, making the Śavara show him the way, set out with his army for that hermitage on the eastern mountain, in order quickly to recover his beloved wife.

The union with your queen, which will mark the termination of your curse, is nigh at hand.
saṃyogā viprayogāśca bhavanti bahavo nṛṇām / tatha cātra kathāmekāṃ kathayāmi śṛṇu prabho //	Human beings experience many unions and separations; and I will tell you a story to illustrate this. Listen, my lord.

tatraivopāttavidyābhyāmupādhyāyo nije sute / devaśarmā dadau tābhyāṃ mūrte vidye ivāpare //	And when they had completed their studies their teacher Devaśarman gave them his own two daughters, like another couple of sciences incarnate in bodily form.
athānyān vīkṣya tānāḍhyān gṛhasthān īrṣyayā śriyam / homaiḥ sa sādhayām āsa kālanemiḥ kṛtavrataḥ //	Then seeing that the householders around him were rich, Kālanemi through envy made a vow and propitiated the Goddess of Fortune with burnt-offerings.
sā ca tuṣṭā satī sākṣādevaṃ śrīstamabhāṣata / bhūri prāpsyasi vittaṃ ca putraṃ ca pṛthivīpatim //	And the goddess being satisfied appeared in bodily form and said to him: “Thou shalt obtain great wealth and a son who shall rule the earth;
kiṃ tvante caurasadṛśo vadhastava bhaviṣyati / hutamagnau tvayā yasmadamarṣakaluṣātmanā //	but at last thou shalt be put to death like a robber, because thou hast offered flesh in the fire with impure motives.”[1] When she had said this, the goddess disappeared;
ityuktvāntardadhe lakṣmīḥ kālanemirapi kramāt / mahādhano 'bhūt kiṃ cāsya dinaiḥ putro 'pyajāyata //	and Kālanemi in course of time became very rich; moreover, after some days a son was born to him.
śrīvarādeṣa saṃprāpta iti nāmnā tamātmajam / śrīdattamakarotso 'pi pitā pūrṇamanorathaḥ //	So the father, whose desires were now accomplished, called that son Śrīdatta,[2] because he had been obtained by the favour of the Goddess of Fortune.
kramātsa vṛddhiṃ saṃprāptaḥ śrīdatto brāhmaṇo 'pi san / astreṃṣu bāhuyuddheṣu babhūvāpratimo bhuvi //	In course of time Śrīdatta grew up, and though a Brāhman, became matchless upon earth in the use of weapons, and in boxing and wrestling.
kālanemeratha bhrātā tīrthārthī sarpabhakṣitām / bhāryāmuddiśya vigatabhayo deśāntaraṃ yayau //	Then Kālanemi’s brother Vigatabhaya went to a foreign land, having become desirous of visiting places of pilgrimage, through sorrow’ for his wife, who had died of the bite of a snake.
śrīdatto 'pi guṇajñena rājñā vallabhaśaktinā / tatra vikramaśakteḥ sa svaputrasya kṛtaḥ sakhā //	Moreover, the king of the land, Vallabhaśakti, who appreciated good qualities, made Śrīdatta the companion of his son Vikramaśakti.
rājaputreṇa tenāsya sahavāso 'bhimāninā / bālye duryodhaneneva bhīmasyāsīttarasvinā //	So he had to live with a haughty prince, as the impetuous Bhīma lived in his youth with Duryodhana.
dvāvetasyātha mittratvaṃ viprasyāvantideśajau / kṣatriyau bāhuśālī ca vajramuṣṭiśca jagmatuḥ //	Then two Kṣatriyas, natives of Avanti, Bāhuśālin and Vajramuṣṭi, became friends of that Brāhman.
bāhuyuddhajitāścānye dākṣiṇātyā guṇapriyāḥ / svayaṃvarasuhṛttvena mantriputrāstamāśrayan //	And some other men from the Deccan, sons of ministers, having been conquered by him in wrestling, resorted to him out of spontaneous friendship, as they knew how to value merit.
mahābalavyāghrabhaṭāvupendrabala ityapi / tathā niṣṭhurako nāma sauhārdaṃ tasya cakrire //	Mahābala and Vyāghrabhaṭa, and also Upendrabala and a man named Niṣṭhuraka, became his friends.
kadācidatha varṣāsu vihartuṃ jāhnavītaṭe / śrīdattaḥ saha tairmitrai rājaputrasakho yayau //	One day, as years rolled on, Śrīdatta, being in attendance on the prince, went with him and those friends to sport on the bank of the Ganges;
svabhṛtyāstatra taṃ cakrurnijaṃ rājasutaṃ nṛpam / śrīdatto 'pi sa tatkālaṃ rājā mittrairakalpyata //	then the prince’s own servants made him king, and at the same time Śrīdatta was chosen king by his friends.
tāvatā jātaroṣeṇa rājaputreṇa tena saḥ / vipravīro raṇāyāśu samāhūto madaspṛśā // sa tena bāhuyuddhena śrīdattenātha nirjitaḥ / cakāra hṛdi vadhyaṃ tu varddhamānaṃ kalaṅkitam //	This made the prince angry, and in overweening confidence he at once challenged that Brāhman hero to fight. Then being conquered by him in wrestling, and so disgraced, he made up his mind that this rising hero should be put to death.
jñātvā ca tamabhiprāyaṃ rājaputrasya śaṅkitaḥ / śrīdattaḥ saha tairmittraistatsamīpādapāsarat //	But Śrīdatta found out that intention of the prince’s, and withdrew in alarm with those friends of his from his presence.
upasarpansa cāpaśyadgaṅgāmadhyagatāṃ striyam / hriyamāṇāṃ jalaughena sāgarasthāmiva śriyam //	And as he was going along he saw in the middle of the Ganges a woman being dragged under by the stream, looking like the Goddess of Fortune in the middle of the sea.
tataś cāvatatāraitām uddhartuṃ jalamadhyataḥ / ṣaḍbāhuśālipramukhān sthāpayitvā taṭe sakhīn //	And then he plunged in to pull her out of the water, leaving Bāhuśālin and his five other friends on the bank.
tāṃ ca keśeṣvapi prāptāṃ nimagnāṃ dūramambhasi / anusartuṃ striyaṃ so 'pi vīrastatraiva magnavān //	Then that woman, though he seized her by the hair, sank deep in the water; and he dived as deep in order to follow her.
nimajjya ca dadarśātra sa śrīdattaḥ kṣaḍāditi / śaivaṃ devakulaṃ divyaṃ na punarvāri na striyam // taddṛṣṭvā mahadāścaryaṃ śrānto natvā vṛṣadhvajam / udyāne sundare tatra tāṃ nināya vibhāvarīm //	And after he had dived a long way he suddenly saw a splendid temple of Śiva, but no water and no woman.[3] After beholding that wonderful sight, being wearied out, he paid his adorations to the god whose emblem is a bull, and spent that night in a beautiful garden attached to the temple.
prāptaśca devamīśānaṃ sā pūjayitumāgatā / dadṛśe tena mūrteva rūpaśrīḥ strīguṇānvitā //	And in the morning that lady was seen by him, having come to worship the god Śiva, like the incarnate splendour of beauty attended by all womanly perfections.
īśvaraṃ pūjayitvā ca sā tato nijamandiram / yayāvindumukhī so 'pi śrīdatto 'nujagāma tām //	And after she had worshipped the god, the moon-faced one departed to her own house, and Śrīdatta for his part followed her.
dadarśa mandiraṃ tacca tasyāḥ surapuropamam / praviveśa ca saṃbhrāntā sāvamāneva māninī //	And he saw that palace of hers resembling the city of the gods, which the haughty beauty entered hurriedly in a contemptuous manner.
sāpyasaṃbhāṣamāṇaiva tamantarvāsaveśmani / tanvī nyapīdat paryaṅke strīsahasropasevitā //	And without deigning to address him, the graceful lady sat down on a sofa in the inner part of the house, waited upon by thousands of women.
śrīdatto 'pi sa tatraiva niṣasāda tadantike / athākasmāt pravavṛtte tayā sādhvyā praroditum //	And Śrīdatta also took a seat near her. Then suddenly that virtuous lady began to weep.
nipetuḥ stanayos tasyāḥ saṃtaptā bāṣpabindavaḥ / śrīdattasya ca tatkālaṃ kāruṇyaṃ hṛdaye gatam //	The teardrops fell in an unceasing shower on her bosom, and that moment pity entered into the heart of Śrīdatta.
tataḥ sa caināṃ papraccha kā tvaṃ duḥkhaṃ ca kiṃ tava / vada sundari śakto 'haṃ tannivārayituṃ yataḥ // tataḥ kathaṃcit sāvādīd vayaṃ daityapater bale / pautryo daśaśataṃ tāsāṃ jyeṣṭhā vidyutprabhetyaham //	And then he said to her: “Who art thou, and what is thy sorrow? Tell me, fair one, for I am able to remove it.” Then she said reluctantly: “We are the thousand granddaughters of Bali,[4] the king of the Daityas, and I am the eldest of all, and my name is Vidyutprabhā.
sa naḥ pitāmaho nīto viṣṇunā dīrghabandhanam / pitā ca bāhuyuddhena hatastenaiva śauriṇā //	That grandfather of ours was carried off by Viṣṇu to long imprisonment, and the same hero slew our father in a wrestling match.
taṃ hatvā tena ca nijātpurānnirvāsitā vayam / praveśarodhakṛttatra siṃhaśca sthāpito 'ntare //	And after he had slain him he excluded us from our own city, and he placed a lion in it to prevent us from entering.[5] The lion occupies that place, and grief our hearts.
āvṛtaṃ tatpadaṃ tena duḥkhena hṛdayaṃ ca naḥ / sa ca yakṣaḥ kuberasya śāpāsiṃhatvamāgataḥ // martyaiścābhibhavastasya śāpāntaḥ kathitaḥ purā / purapraveśopāyārthe vijñapto viṣṇur ādiśat //	It is a Yakṣa that was made a lion by the curse of Kuvera, and long ago it was predicted that the Yakṣa’s curse should end when he was conquered by some mortal; so Viṣṇu deigned to inform us on our humbly asking him how we might be enabled to enter our city.
ataḥ sa śatrurasmākaṃ kesarī jīyatāṃ tvayā / tadarthameva cānīto mayā vīra bhavāniha //	Therefore subdue that lion, our enemy: it was for that reason, O hero, that I enticed you hither.
mṛgāṅkakākhyaṃ khaḍgaṃ ca jitāttasmādavāpsyasi / pṛthivīṃ yatprabhāveṇa jitvā rājā bhaviṣyasi // tacchrutvā sa tathetyatra śrīdatto 'tītataddinaḥ / anyedyurdaityakanyāstāḥ kṛtvāgre tatpuraṃ yayau // jigāya bāhuyuddhena tatra taṃ siṃham uddhatam / so 'pi śāpavimuktaḥ san babhūva puruṣākṛtiḥ //	And when you have overcome him you will obtain from him a sword named Mṛgāṅka,[6] by the virtue of which you shall conquer the world and become a king.” When he heard that, Śrīdatta agreed to undertake the adventure, and after that day had passed, on the morrow he took those Daitya maidens with him as guides, and went to that city, and there he overcame in wrestling that haughty lion.
dattvā cāsmai sa khaḍgaṃ svaṃ tuṣṭaḥ śāpāntakāriṇe / sahāsurāṅganāduḥkhabhāreṇādarśanaṃ yayau //	He being freed from his curse assumed a human form, and out of gratitude gave his sword to the man who had put an end to his curse, and then disappeared together with the burden of the sorrow' of the great Asura’s daughter.
so 'tha sānujayā sākaṃ śrīdatto daityakanyayā / bahirgatamivānantaṃ tadviveśa purottamam //	Then that Śrīdatta, together with the Daitya’s daughter, who was accompanied by her younger sisters, entered that splendid city, which looked like the serpent Ananta[7] having emerged from the earth.
aṅgulīyaṃ viṣaghnaṃ ca sāsmai daityasutā dadau / tataḥ so 'tra sthitastasyāṃ sābhilāṣo 'bhavadyuvā // sātha yuktyā jagādainaṃ vāpyāṃ snānamitaḥ kuru / adāyainaṃ ca majjestvaṃ khaḍgaṃ grāhabhayāpaham // tatheti vāpyāṃ magnaḥ sañ śrīdatto jāhnavītaṭāt / tasmād eva samuttasthau yasmāt pūrvam avātarat //	And that Daitya maiden gave him a ring that destroyed the effect of poison. [also see notes on poison detectors] Then that young man, remaining there, fell in love with her. And she cunningly said to him: “Bathe in this tank, and when you dive in take with you this sword[8] to keep off the danger of crocodiles.” He consented, and diving into the tank rose upon that very bank of the Ganges from which he first plunged in.
khaḍgāṅgulīyake paśyan pātālād utthito 'tha saḥ / viṣaṇṇo vismitaś cāsīd vañcito 'surakanyayā //	Then he, seeing the ring and the sword, felt astonishment at having emerged from the lower regions, and despondency at having been tricked by the Asura maid.
tatastānsuhṛdo 'nveṣṭuṃ svagṛhābhimukhaṃ yayau / gacchanniṣṭhurakākhyaṃ ca mittraṃ mārge dadarśa saḥ //	Then he went towards his own house to look for his friends, and as he was going he saw on the way his friend Niṣṭhuraka.

śrīdattaḥ kva sa te putra iti cāmarṣanirbharaḥ / tamapṛcchatsa cāpyenaṃ nāhaṃ vedmītyabhāṣata // pracchādito 'munā putra iti tena niṣūditaḥ / kālanemiḥ sa śūlāyāṃ rājñā caura iti krudhā //	Now the day after he was made king he went to the house of Kālanemi and, full of wrath, asked where his son Śrīdatta was, and he replied: “I do not know.” Then the king in a rage, supposing he had concealed his son, had him put to death by impalement as a thief.
taddṛṣṭvā tasya bhāryāyāḥ svayaṃ hṛdayamasphuṭat / pāpaṃ pāpāntarākṣepakrūraṃ hi krūrakarmaṇām //	When his wife saw that, her heart broke. Men of cruel deeds must always pile one evil upon another in long succession;
iti tenoditāḥ puṃsā śokārtāste nijāṃ bhuvam / bāhuśālyādayaḥ pañca saṃmantryojjayinīṃ gatāḥ // pracchannaḥ sthāpitaścāhaṃ tvadarthamiha taiḥ sakhe / tadehi tāvad gacchāvas tatraiva suhṛdantikam //	and so Vikramaśakti is searching for Śrīdatta to slay him, and you are his friends, therefore leave this place.’ When the man had given us this warning, Bāhuśālin and his four companions, being grieved, went by common consent to their own home in Ujjayinī. And they left me here in concealment, my friend, for your sake.
evaṃ niṣṭhurakāc chrutvā pitarāv anuśocya saḥ / nidadhe pratikārāsthām iva khaḍge dṛśaṃ muhuḥ //	So come, let us go to that very place to meet our friends.” Having heard this from Niṣṭhuraka, and having bewailed his parents, Śrīdatta cast many a look at his sword, as if reposing in that his hope of vengeance;
kālaṃ pratīkṣamāṇo 'tha vīro niṣṭhurakānvitaḥ / pratasthe tān sakhīn prāptuṃ sa tām ujjayinīṃ purīm //	then the hero, biding his time, set out, accompanied by Niṣṭhuraka, for that city of Ujjayinī in order to meet his friends.
āmajjanāntaṃ vṛttāntaṃ sakhyus tasya ca varṇayan / śrīdattaḥ sa dadarśaikāṃ krośantīmabalāṃ pathi // abalā bhraṣṭamārgāhaṃ mālavaṃ prasthiteti tām / bruvantīṃ dayayā so 'tha sahapasthāyinīṃ vyadhāt //	And as he was relating to his friend his adventures from the time of his plunging into the stream, Śrīdatta beheld a woman weeping in the road; when she said, “I am a woman going to Ujjayinī and I have lost my way,” Śrīdatta out of pity made her journey along with him.
tayā dayānurodhācca striyā niṣṭhurakānvitaḥ / kasmiṃścicchūnyanagare dine tasminnuvāsa saḥ //	He and Niṣṭhuraka, together with that woman, whom he kept with him out of compassion, halted that day in a certain deserted town.
tatra rātrāvakasmācca muktanidro dadarśa tām / striyaṃ niṣṭhurakaṃ hatvā harṣāttanmāṃsamaśnatīm // udatiṣṭhat samākṛṣya so 'tha khaḍgaṃ mṛgāṅkakam / sāpi strī rākṣasīrūpaṃ ghoraṃ svaṃ pratyapadyata //	There he suddenly woke up in the night and beheld that the woman had slain Niṣṭhuraka and was devouring his flesh with the utmost delight. Then he rose up, drawing his sword Mṛgāṅka, and that woman assumed her own terrible form, that of a Rākṣasī,[9] and he seized that night-wanderer by her hair, to slay her.
sa ca keśeṣu jagrāha nihantuṃ tāṃ niśācarīm / tatkṣaṇaṃ divyarūpatvaṃ saṃprāptā tamuvāca sā //	That moment she assumed a heavenly shape and said to him: “Slay me not, mighty hero, let me go;
mā māṃ vadhīrmahābhāga muñca naivāsmi rākṣasī / ayamevaṃvidhaḥ śāpo mamābhūtkauśikānmuneḥ //	I am not a Rākṣasī; the hermit Viśvāmitra imposed this condition on me by a curse.
tapasyato hi tasyāhaṃ dhanādhipatināmunā / vighnāya preṣitā pūrvaṃ tatpadaprāptikāṅkṣiṇaḥ //	For once, when he was performing austerities from a desire to attain the position of the God of Wealth, I was sent by the god to impede him.
tataḥ kāntena rūpeṇa taṃ kṣobhayitumakṣamā / lajjitā trāsayantyenamakārṣaṃ bhairavaṃ vapuḥ //	Then finding that I was not able to seduce him with my alluring form, being abashed, I assumed, in order to terrify him, a formidable shape.
taddṛṣṭvā sa muniḥ śāpaṃ sadṛśaṃ mayyatho dadhe / rākṣasī bhava pāpe tvaṃ nighnantī mānuṣāniti // tvattaḥ keśagrahe prāpte śāpāntaṃ me sa cākarot / ityahaṃ rākṣasībhāvamimaṃ kaṣṭamupāgamam //	When he saw this, that hermit laid on me a curse suitable to my offence, exclaiming: ‘Wicked one, become a Rākṣasī and slay men.’ And he appointed my curse should end when you took hold of my hair; accordingly I assumed this detestable condition of a Rākṣasī, and I have devoured all the inhabitants of this town.
mayaiva nagaraṃ caitadgrastamadya ca me cirāt / tvayā kṛtaḥ sa śāpāntastadgṛhāṇādhunā varam // iti tasyā vacaḥ śrutvā śrīdattaḥ sādaro 'bhyadhāt / kimanyena vareṇādhya jīvatveṣa sakhā mama //	Now to-day, after a long time, you have brought my curse to an end in the manner foretold, therefore receive now some boon.” When he heard that speech of hers, Śrīdatta said respectfully: “Mother, grant that my friend may be restored to life.
evamastviti sā cāsmai varaṃ dattvā tirodhadhe / akṣatāṅgaḥ sa cottasthau jīvanniṣṭhurakaḥ punaḥ //	What need have I of any other boon?” “So be it,” she said, and after granting the boon disappeared. And Niṣṭhuraka rose up again alive without a scratch on his body.
tenaiva saha ca prātaḥ prahṛṣṭo vismitaśca saḥ / tataḥ pratasthe śrīdattaḥ prāpa cojjayinīṃ kramāt //	Then Śrīdatta set out the next morning with him delighted and astonished and at last reached Ujjayinī.
tatra saṃbhāvayāmāsa sakhīnmārgonmukhānsa tān / darśanena yathāyāto nīlakaṇṭhānivāmbudaḥ // kṛtātithyavidhiścāsau svagṛhaṃ bāhuśālinā / nīto 'bhūtkathitāśeṣanijavṛttāntakautukaḥ //	There he revived by his appearance the spirits of his friends, who were anxiously expecting him, as the arrival of the cloud revives the peacocks. And after he had told all the wonders of his adventures Bāhuśālin went through the usual formalities of hospitality, taking him to his own home.
tatropacaryamāṇaḥ san pitṛbhyāṃ bāhuśālinaḥ / sa uvāsa samaṃ mittraiḥ śrīdattaḥ svagṛhe yathā //	There Śrīdatta was taken care of by the parents of Bāhuśālin, and lived with his friends as comfortably as if he were in his own house.
kadācitso 'tha saṃprāpte madhumāsamahotsave / yātrāmupavane draṣṭuṃ jagāma sakhibhiḥ saha //	Once on a time, when the great feast of springtide[10] had arrived, he went with his friends to behold some festal rejoicings in a garden.
tatra kanyāṃ dadarśaikāṃ rājñaḥ śrībimbakeḥ sutām / āgatāmākṛtimatīṃ sākṣādiva madhuśriyam //	There he beheld a maiden, the daughter of King Bimbaki, who had come to see the show, looking like the Goddess of the Splendour of Spring present in bodily form.
sā mṛgāṅkavatī nāma hṛdayaṃ tasya tatkṣaṇam / viveśa dattamārgeva dṛṣṭyāsya savikāsayā //	She, by name Mṛgāṅkavatī, that moment penetrated into his heart, as if through the openings left by the expansion of his eye.
tasyā api muhuḥ snigdhā prathamapremaśaṃsinī / nyastā taṃ prati dūtīva dṛṣṭiścakre gatāgatam //	Her passionate look, too, indicative of the beginning of love, fixed on him, went and returned like a confidante.
praviṣṭāṃ vṛkṣagahanaṃ tāmapaśyannatha kṣaṇāt / śrīdattaḥ śūnyahṛdayo diśo 'pi na dadarśa saḥ //	When she entered a thicket of trees, Śrīdatta, not beholding her, suddenly felt his heart so empty that he did not know where he was.
jñātaṃ mayā te hṛdayaṃ sakhe māpahnavaṃ kṛthāḥ / tadehi tatra gacchāvo yatra rājasutā gatā // ityuktaśceṅgitajñena suhṛdā bāhuśālinā / tatheti sa yayau tasyāḥ saṃnikarṣaṃ suhṛtsakhaḥ //	His friend Bāhuśālin, who thoroughly understood the language of gestures, said to him: “My friend, I know your heart, do not deny your passion, therefore come, let us go to that part of the garden where the king’s daughter is.” He consented and went near her, accompanied by his friend.
hā kaṣṭamahinā daṣṭā rājaputrīti tatkṣaṇam / ākranda udabhūttatra śrīdattahṛdayajvaraḥ // viṣaghnamaṅgulīyaṃ ca vidyā ca suhṛdo 'sya me / astīti gatvā jagade kañcukī bāhuśālinā // sa ca tatkṣaṇamabhyetya kañcukī caraṇānataḥ / nikaṭaṃ rājaduhituḥ śrīdattamanayaddrutam //	That moment a cry was heard there which gave great pain to the heart of Śrīdatta: “Alas, the princess has been bitten by a snake!” Bāhuśālin then went and said to the chamberlain: “My friend here possesses a ring that counteracts the effects of poison, and also healing spells.” Immediately the chamberlain came and, bowing at his feet, quickly led Śrīdatta to the princess.
so 'pi tasyāstadaṅgulyāṃ nicikṣepāṅgulīyakam / tato jajāpa vidyāṃ ca tena pratyujjijīva sā //	He placed the ring on her finger and then muttered his spells, so that she revived.
atha sarvajane hṛṣṭe śrīdattastutitatpare / tatraiva jñātavṛttānto rājā bimbakirāyayau //	Then all the attendants were delighted, and loud in praise of Śrīdatta, and the King Bimbaki hearing the circumstances came to the place.
tenāsau sakhibhiḥ sārdhamagṛhītāṅgulīyakaḥ / pratyājagāma śrīdatto bhavanaṃ bāhuśālinaḥ //	Accordingly Śrīdatta returned with his friends to the house of Bāhuśālin without taking back the ring.
tatra tasmai suvarṇādi yatprītaḥ prāhiṇonnṛpaḥ / tadbāhuśālinaḥ pitre samagraṃ sa samarpayat //	And all the gold and other presents which the delighted king sent to him there he handed over to the father of Bāhuśālin.
atha tāṃ cintayan kāntāṃ sa tathā paryatapyata / yathā kiṃkāryatāmūḍhā vayasyas tasya jajñire //	Then, thinking upon that fair one, he was so much afflicted that his friends became utterly bewildered as to what to do with him.
tato bhāvanikā nāma rājaputryāḥ priyā sakhī / aṅgulīyārpaṇavyājāttasyāntikamupāyayau // uvāca cainaṃ matsakhyās tasyāḥ subhaga sāṃpratam / tvaṃ vā prāṇaprado bhartā mṛtyurvāpyeṣa niścayaḥ // ityukte bhāvanikayā śrīdattaḥ sa ca sāpi ca / bāhuśālī ca te 'nye ca mantraṃ saṃbhūya cakrire // harāmo nibhṛtaṃ yuktyā rājaputrīmimāṃ vayam / nivāsahetor guptaṃ ca gacchāmo mathurāmitaḥ // iti saṃmantrite samyakkāyasiddhyai ca saṃvidi / anyonyaṃ sthāpitāyāṃ sā yayau bhāvanikā tataḥ //	Then a dear friend of the princess, Bhāvanikā by name, came to him on pretence of returning the ring, and said to him: “That friend of mine, illustrious sir, has made up her mind that either you must save her life by becoming her husband, or she will be married to her grave.” When Bhāvanikā had said this Śrīdatta and Bāhuśālin and the others quickly put their heads together and came to the following resolution:— “We will carry off this princess secretly by a stratagem, and will go unperceived from here to Mathurā and live there.” The plan having been thoroughly talked over, and the conspirators having agreed with one another what each was to do in order to carry it out, Bhāvanikā then departed.
anyedyurbāhuśālī ca vayasyatritayānvitaḥ / vaṇijyāvyapadeśena jagāma mathurāṃ prati //	And the next day Bāhuśālin, accompanied by three of his friends, went to Mathurā on pretext of trafficking, and as he went he posted in concealment at intervals swift horses for the conveyance of the princess.
śrīdatto 'pi tataḥ kācmidduhitrā sahitāṃ striyam / sāyaṃ rājasutāvāse pāyayitvā madhu nyadhāt // tato 'tra dīpoddeśena dattvāgniṃ vāsaveśmani / pracchannaṃ bhāvanikayā ninye rājasutā bahiḥ //	But Śrīdatta then brought at eventide a woman with her daughter into the palace of the princess, after making them both drink spirits, and then Bhāvanikā, on pretence of lighting up the palace, set fire to it, and secretly conveyed the princess out of it;
tatkṣaṇaṃ tāṃ ca saṃprāpya śrīdattaḥ sa bahiḥ sthitaḥ / prākprasthitasya nikaṭaṃ prāhiṇodbāhuśālinaḥ // dadau mitradvayaṃ cāsyāḥ paścādbhāvanikāṃ tathā / tanmandire ca dagdhā sā kṣībā strī sutayā saha //	and that moment Śrīdatta, who was remaining outside, received her, and sent her on to Bāhuśālin, who had started in the morning, and directed two of his friends to attend on her and also Bhāvanikā. Now that drunken woman and her daughter were burnt in the palace of the princess, and people supposed that the princess had been burnt with her friend.
lokastu tāṃ sakhīyuktāṃ mene dagdhāṃ nṛpātmajām / prātaśca pūrvavattatra śrīdatto dadṛśe janaiḥ //	But Śrīdatta took care to show himself in the morning, as before, in the city;
tato rātrau dvitīyasyāṃ sa gṛhītamṛgāṅkakaḥ / śrīdattaḥ prayayau pūrvaprasthitāṃ tāṃ priyāṃ prati //	then on the second night, taking with him his sword Mṛgāṅka, he started to follow his beloved, who had set out before him.
tayā ca rātryātikramya dūramadhvānam utsukaḥ / vindhyāṭavīmatha prāpa sa prātaḥ prahare gate //	And in his eagerness he accomplished a great distance that night, and when the morning watch[11] had passed he reached the Vindhya forest.
tatrādāvanimittāni paścāt pathi dadarśa tān / sarvān prahārābhihatān sahabhāvanikān sakhīn // te ca dṛṣṭvā nijagadustaṃ saṃbhrāntamupāgatam / muṣitāḥ smo nipatyādya bahvaśvārohasenayā //	There he first beheld unlucky omens, and afterwards he saw all those friends of his, together with Bhāvanikā, lying in the road gashed with wounds. And when he came up all distracted they said to him: “We were robbed to-day by a large troop of horsemen that set upon us.
ekena cāśvāroheṇa rājaputrī bhayākulā / asmāsvetadavastheṣu nītāśvamadhiropya sā //	And after we were reduced to this state one of the horsemen threw the terrified princess on his horse and carried her off.
dūraṃ na yāvan nītā ca tāvadgacchānayā diśā / asmākamantike mā sthāḥ sarvathābhyadhikā ca sā // iti taiḥ preṣito mittrairmuhuḥ paśyanvivṛtya saḥ / javena rājatanayāṃ śrīdatto 'nusasāra tām //	So before she has been carried a great distance, go in this direction; do not remain near us, she is certainly of more importance than we.” Being urged on with these words by his friends, Śrīdatta rapidly followed after the princess, but could not help frequently turning round to look at them.
gatvā sudūraṃ lebhe ca tāmaśvārohavāhinīm / yuvānamekaṃ tanmadhye kṣatriyaṃ sa dadarśa ca //	And after he had gone a considerable distance he caught up that troop of cavalry, and he saw a young man of the warrior caste in the midst of it.
tenopari ruraṃgasya gṛhītāṃ taṃ nṛpātmajām / apaśyacca yayau cāsya kṣatrayūno 'ntikaṃ kramāt // sāntvena rājaputrīṃ tāmamuñcantaṃ ca pādataḥ / aśvādākṣipya dṛṣadi śrīdattastamacūrṇayat //	And he beheld that princess held by him upon his horse. So he slowly approached that young warrior; and when soft words would not induce him to let the princess go, he hurled him from his horse with a blow of his foot and dashed him to pieces on a rock.
taṃ hatvā ca tam evāśvam āruhya nijaghāna tān / anyān api bahūn kruddhān aśvārohān pradhāvitān //	And after he had slain him he mounted on his horse and slew a great number of the other horsemen who charged him in anger.
hataśeṣāstataste ca taddṛṣṭvā tasya tādṛśam / vīrasyāmānuṣaṃ vīryaṃ palāyya sabhayaṃ yayuḥ //	And then those who remained alive, seeing that the might which the hero displayed was more than human, fled away in terror;
sa cāpi turagārūḍho rājaputryā tayā saha / mṛgāṅkavatyā śrīdattaḥ prayayau tān sakhīn prati // stokaṃ gatvā ca tasyāśvaḥ saṃgrāme vraṇito bhṛśam / sabhāryasyāvatīrṇasya papāta prāpa pañcatām //	and Śrīdatta mounted on the horse with the Princess Mṛgāṅkavatī and set out to find those friends of his. And after he had gone a little way he and his wife got off the horse, which had been severely wounded in the fight, and soon after it fell down and died.
tatkālaṃ cāsya tatraiva sā mṛgāṅkavatī priyā / trāsāyāsapariśrāntā tṛṣārtā samapadyata //	And then his beloved Mṛgāṅkavatī, exhausted with fear and exertion, became very thirsty.
sthāpayitvā ca tāṃ tatra gatvā dūramitastataḥ / jalamanviṣyataścāsya savitāstamupāyayau //	And leaving her there, he roamed a long distance hither and thither, and while he was looking for water the sun set.
tataḥ sa labdhe 'pi jale mārganāśavaśādbhraman / cakravākavadutkūjaṃstāṃ nināya niśāṃ vane //	Then he discovered that though he had found water he had lost his way, and he passed that night in the wood roaming about, moaning aloud like a Cakravāka.[12] And in the morning he reached that place, which was easy to recognise by the carcase of the horse.
prātaḥ prāpa ca tatsthānaṃ patitāśvopalakṣitam / na ca tatra kacitkāntāṃ rājaputrīṃ dadarśa tām //	And nowhere there did he behold his beloved princess.
tataḥ sa mohād vinyasya bhuvi khaḍgaṃ mṛgāṅkakam / vṛkṣāgramārurohaināmavekṣitumitastataḥ // tatkṣaṇaṃ tena mārgeṇa ko 'pyagācchavarādhipaḥ / sa cāgatyaiva jagrāha vṛkṣamūlānmṛgāṅkakam //	Then in his distraction he placed his sword Mṛgāṅka on the ground and climbed to the top of a tree, in order to cast his eye in all directions for her. That very moment a certain Śavara chieftain passed that way, and he came up and took the sword from the foot of the tree.
taṃ dṛṣṭvāpi sa vṛkṣāgrādavatīryaiva pṛṣṭavān / priyāpravṛttimatyārtaḥ śrīdattaḥ śavarādhipam //	Beholding that Śavara chieftain, Śrīdatta came down from the top of the tree and in great grief asked him for news of his beloved.
itastvaṃ gaccha matpallīṃ jāne sā tatra te gatā / ahaṃ tatraiva caiṣyāmi dāsyāsyasimimaṃ ca te //	The Śavara chieftain said: “Leave this place and come to my village; I have no doubt she whom you seek has gone there;
ityuktvā preṣitastena śabareṇa sa cotsukaḥ / śrīdattastāṃ yayau pallīṃ tadīyaiḥ puruṣaiḥ saha // śramaṃ tāvadvimuñceti tatroktaḥ puruṣaiśca taiḥ / prāpya pallīpatergehaṃ śrānto nidrāṃ kṣaṇādyayau //	and I shall come there and return you this sword.” When the Śavara chieftain urged him to go with these words, Śrīdatta, being himself all eagerness, went to that village with the chief’s men. And there those men said to him: “Sleep off your fatigue.” And when he reached the house of the chief of the village, being tired, he went to sleep in an instant.
prabuddhaśca dadarśa svau pādau nigaḍasaṃyutau / alabdhatadgatī kāntāprāptyupāyodyamāviva //	And when he woke up he saw his two feet fastened with fetters, like the two efforts he had made in order to obtain his beloved, which failed to reach their object.
atha kṣaṇaṃ dattasukhāṃ kṣaṇāntaravimāthinīm / daivasyeva gatiṃ tatra tasthau śocansa tāṃ priyām //	Then he remained there weeping for his darling, who, like the course of destiny, had for a moment brought him joy, and the next moment blasted his hopes.
ekadā tamuvācaitya ceṭī mocanikābhidhā / āgato 'si mahābhāga kutreha bata mṛtyave //	One day a serving-maid of the name of Mocanikā came to him and said: “Illustrious sir, unwittingly you have come hither to your death.
kāryasiddhyai sa hi kāpi prayātaḥ śabarādhipaḥ / āgatya caṇḍikāyāstvāmupahārīkariṣyati // etadarthaṃ hi tena tvamito vindhyāṭavītaṭāt / prāpya yuktyā visṛjyeha nītaḥ saṃprati bandhanam //	For the Śavara chieftain has gone somewhither to accomplish certain weighty affairs, and when he returns he will offer you to Caṇḍikā.[13] For with that object he decoyed you here by a stratagem from this slope of the wild Vindhya hill, and immediately threw you into the chains in which you now are.
bhagavatyupahāratve yata evāsi kalpitaḥ / ata eva sadā vastrairbhojanaiścopacaryase //	And it is because you are intended to be offered as a victim to the goddess that you are continually served with garments and food.
ekastu muktyupāyaste vidyate yadi manyase / astyasya sundarī nāma śabarādhipateḥ sutā // atyarthaṃ sā ca dṛṣṭvā tvāṃ jāyate madanāturā / tāṃ bhajasva vayasyāṃ me tataḥ kṣemamavāpsyasi // tayetyukto vimuktyarthī sa śrīdattastatheti tām / gāndharvavidhinā guptaṃ bhāryāṃ vyadhita sundarīm //	But I know of only one expedient for delivering you, if you agree to it. This Śavara chieftain has a daughter named Sundarī, and she having seen you is becoming exceedingly lovesick; marry her who is my friend, then you will obtain deliverance.”[14] When she said this to him Śrīdatta consented, desiring to be set at liberty, and secretly made that Sundarī his wife by the gāndharva form of marriage.
rātrau rātrau ca sā tasya bandhanāni nyavārayat / acirācca sagarbhā sā sundarī samapadyata //	And every night she removed his chains, and in a short time Sundarī became pregnant.
tatsarvamatha tanmātā buddhvā mocanikāmukhāt / jāmātṛsnehato gatvā svairaṃ śrīdattamabravīt // putra śrīcaṇḍanāmāsau kopanaḥ sundarīpitā / na tvāṃ kṣameta tadgaccha vismartavyā na sundarī //	Then her mother, having heard the whole story from the mouth of Mocanikā, out of love for her son-in-law Śrīdatta, went and of her own accord said to him: “My son, Śrīcaṇḍa, the father of Sundarī, is a wrathful man, and will show thee no mercy;
ityuktvā mocitaḥ śvaśrvā khaḍgaṃ śrīcaṇḍahastagam / sundaryai nijamāvedya śrīdattaḥ prayayau tataḥ //	but thou must not forget Sundarī.” When his mother-in-law had said this, she set him at liberty, and Śrīdatta departed, after telling Sundarī that the sword which was in her father’s possession really belonged to himself.
viveśa cādyāṃ tāmeva cintākrānto nijāṭavīm / mṛgāṅkavatyāḥ padavīṃ tasya jijñāsituṃ punaḥ //	So he again entered, full of anxiety, that forest in which he had before wandered about, in order again to search for traces of Mṛgāṅkavatī.
nimittaṃ ca śubhaṃ dṛṣṭvā tamevoddeśamāyayau / yatrāsyāśvo mṛtaḥ so 'tha yatra sā hāritā vadhūḥ // tatra caikaṃ dadarśārāllubdhakaṃ saṃmukhāgatam / dṛṣṭvā ca pṛṣṭavāṃstasyāḥ pravṛttiṃ hariṇīdṛśaḥ //	And having seen an auspicious omen he came to that same place where that horse of his died before, and whence his wife was carried off. And there he saw near him[15] a hunter coming towards him, and when he saw him he asked him for news of that gazelle-eyed lady.
kiṃ śrīdattastvamityukto lubdhakena ca tatra saḥ / sa eva mandabhāgyo 'hamityuvāca viniḥśvasan // tataḥ sa lubdhako 'vādīttarhi vacmi sakhe śṛṇu / dṛṣṭā sā te mayā bhāryā krandantī tvāmitastataḥ // pṛṣṭvā tataśca vṛttāntamāśvāsya ca kṛpākulaḥ / nijāṃ pallīmito 'raṇyāddīnāṃ tāṃ nītavānaham //	Then the hunter asked him: “Are you Śrīdatta?” and he, sighing, replied: “I am that unfortunate man.” Then that hunter said: “Listen, friend, I have somewhat to tell you. I saw that wife of yours wandering hither and thither lamenting your absence, and having asked her her story, and consoled her, moved with compassion I took her out of this wood to my own village.
tatra cālokya taruṇān pulindān sabhayena sā / mathurānikaṭaṃ grāmaṃ nītā nāgasthalaṃ mayā // tatra ca sthāpitā gehe sthavirasya dvijanmanaḥ / viśvadattābhidhānasya nyāsīkṛtya sagauravam //	But when I saw the young Pulindas[16] there I was afraid, and I took her to a village named Nāgasthala, near Mathurā.[17] And then I placed her in the house of an old Brāhman named Viśvadatta, commending her with all due respect to his care.
tataś cāham ihāyāto buddhvā tvannāma tanmukhāt / tām anveṣṭuṃ tato gaccha śīghraṃ nāgasthalaṃ prati // ityukto lubdhakenāśu sa śrīdattastato yayau / taṃ ca nāgasthalaṃ prāpadaparedyurdinātyaye //	And thence I came here, having learnt your name from her lips. Therefore you had better go quickly to Nāgasthala to search for her.” When the hunter had told him this Śrīdatta quickly set out, and he reached Nāgasthala in the evening of the second day.
tacchrutvā viśvadattastaṃ śrīdattaṃ nijagāda saḥ / mathurāyāṃ suhṛnme 'sti brāhmaṇo guṇināṃ priyaḥ // upādhyāyaśca mantrī ca śūrasenasya bhūpateḥ / tasya haste tvadīyā sā gṛhiṇī sthāpitā mayā //	Then he entered the house of Viśvadatta and when he saw him said: “Give me my wife, who was placed here by the hunter.” Viśvadatta when he heard that answered him: “I have a friend in Mathurā, a Brāhman, dear to all virtuous men, the spiritual preceptor and minister of the King Śūrasena;
bhayaṃ hi vijano grāmo na tadrakṣākṣamo bhavet / tatprātastatra gaccha tvamadya viśramyatāmiha //	in his care I placed your wife; for this village is an out-of-the-way place and would not afford her protection.
ityukto viśvadattena sa nītvātraiva tāṃ niśām / prātaḥ pratasthe prāpacca mathurāmapare dine //	So go to that city to-morrow morning, but to-day rest here.” When Viśvadatta said this, he spent that night there, and the next morning he set off, and reached Mathurā on the second day.
dīrghādhvamalinastasminnagare bahireva saḥ / snānaṃ cakre pariśrānto nirmale dīrghikājale //	Being weary and dusty with the long journey, he bathed outside that city in the pellucid water of a lake.
tata evāmbumadhyācca vastraṃ cauraniveśitam / prāptavānañcalagranthibaddhahāramaśaṅkitam // atha tadvastramādāya sa taṃ hāramalakṣayan / priyāṃ didṛkṣuḥ śrīdatto viveśa mathurāṃ purīm //	And he drew out of the middle of the lake a garment placed there by some robbers, not suspecting any harm. But in one corner of the garment, which was knotted up, a necklace was concealed.[18] Then Śrīdatta took that garment, and in his eagerness to meet his wife did not notice the necklace, and so entered the city of Mathurā.
tatra tatpratyabhijñāya vastraṃ hāramavāpya ca / sa caura ityavaṣṭabhya ninye nagararakṣibhiḥ // darśitaśca tathābhūto nagarādhipateśca taiḥ / tenāpyāvedito rājñe rājāpyasyādiśadvadham // tato vadhyabhuvaṃ hantuṃ nīyamānaṃ dadarśa tam / sā mṛgāṅkavatī dūrātpaścātprahataḍiṇḍimam //	Then the city police recognised the garment, and finding the necklace, arrested Śrīdatta as a thief, and carried him off, and brought him before the chief magistrate exactly as he was found with the garment in his possession; by him he was handed up to the king, and the king ordered him to be put to death.[19] Then as he was being led off to the place of execution, with the drum being beaten behind him,[20] his wife Mṛgāṅkavatī saw him in the distance.
so 'yaṃ me nīyate bhartā vadhāyeti sasaṃbhramam / sā gatvā mantrimukhyaṃ tamabravīdyadgṛhe sthitā // nivārya vadhakānso 'tha mantrī vijñapya bhūpatim / śrīdattaṃ mocayitvā taṃ vadhādānāyayadgṛham //	She went in a state of the utmost distraction and said to the chief minister, in whose house she was residing: “Yonder is my husband being led off to execution.” Then that minister went and ordered the executioners to desist, and by making a representation to the king got Śrīdatta pardoned, and had him brought to his house.
kathaṃ so 'yaṃ pitṛvyo me gatvā deśāntaraṃ purā / ihaiva daivādvigatabhayaḥ prāpto 'dya mantritām // iti taṃ mantriṇaṃ so 'tha śrīdattas tadgṛhāgataḥ / pratyabhijñātavān pṛṣṭvā papātāsya ca pādayoḥ // so 'pi taṃ pratyabhijñāya bhrātuḥ putraṃ savismayaḥ / kaṇṭhe jagrāha sarvaṃ ca vṛttāntaṃ paripṛṣṭavān //	And when Śrīdatta reached his house, and saw that minister, he recognised him and fell at his feet, exclaiming: “What! is this my uncle Vigatabhaya, who long ago went to a foreign country, and do I now by good luck find him established in the position of a minister?” He too recognised, to his astonishment, Śrīdatta as his brother’s son, and embraced him, and questioned him about all his adventures.
tatastasmai sa nikhilaṃ śrīdattaḥ svapiturvadhāt / ārabhya nijavṛttāntaṃ pitṛvyāya nyavedayat //	Then Śrīdatta related to his uncle his whole history, beginning with the execution of his father.
so 'pi muktvāśru vijane bhrātuḥ putraṃ tamabhyadhāt / adhṛtiṃ mā kṛthāḥ putra mama siddhā hi yakṣiṇī //	And he, after weeping, said to his nephew in private: “Do not despond, my son, for I once brought a female Yakṣa into subjection by means of magic;
pañca vājisahasrāṇi hemakoṭīśca sapta sā / prādānmahyamaputrāya tattavaivākhilaṃ dhanam //	and she gave me, though I have no son, five thousand horses and seventy millions of gold pieces;
ityuktvā sa pitṛvyastāṃ śrīdattāyārpayatpriyām / śrīdatto 'pyāttavibhavastatra tāṃ pariṇītavān //	and all that wealth is at your disposal.” After telling him this, his uncle brought him his beloved, and he, having obtained wealth, married her on the spot.
tataśca tasthau tatraiva saṃgataḥ kāntayā tayā / mṛgāṅgavatyā sānando rātryeva kumudākaraḥ //	And then he remained there in joy, united with that beloved Mṛgāṅkavatī as a bed of white lotuses[21] with the night.
bāhuśālyādicintā tu tasyābhūtpūrṇasaṃpadaḥ / indoḥ kalaṅkalekheva hṛdi mālinyadāyinī //	But even when his happiness was at its full, anxiety for Bāhuśālin and his companions clouded his heart, as a spot of darkness does the full moon.
ekadā sa pitṛvyastaṃ rahaḥ śrīdattamabhyadhāt / putra rājñaḥ sutāstyasya śūrasenasya kanyakā // mayā cāvantideśe sā neyā dātuṃ tadājñayā / tattenaivāpadeśena hṛtvā tubhyaṃ dadāmi tām //	Now one day his uncle said secretly to Śrīdatta: “My son, the King Śūrasena has a maiden daughter, and in accordance with his orders I have to take her to the land of Avanti to give her away in marriage; so I will take her away on that very pretext, and marry her to you.
tatastadanuge prāpte bale sati ca māmake / yadrājyaṃ te śriyādiṣṭaṃ tatprāpsyasyacirāditi // niścityaitacca tāṃ kanyāṃ gṛhītvā yayatustataḥ / śrīdattastatpitṛvyaśca sasainyau saparigrahau //	Then, when you have got possession of the force that follows her, with mine already at your disposal, you will soon gain the kingdom that was promised you by the goddess Srī.” Having resolved on this, and having taken that maiden, Śrīdatta and his uncle set out with their army and their attendants.
tato vindhyāṭavīm etau prāptamātrāvatarkitau / caurasenātimahatī rurodha śaravarṣiṇī //	But as soon as they had reached the Vindhya forest, before they were aware of the danger, a large army of brigands set upon them showering arrows.
prahāramūrcchitaṃ baddhvā śrīdattaṃ bhagnasainikam / ninyuścaurāḥ svapallīṃ te svīkṛtya sakalaṃ dhanam //	After routing Śrīdatta’s force and seizing all the wealth, they bound Śrīdatta himself, who had fainted from his wounds, and carried him off to their village.
te ca taṃ prāpayāmāsuścaṇḍikāsadma bhīṣaṇam / upahārāya ghaṇṭānāṃ nādairmṛtyurivāhvayat //	And they took him to the awful temple of Durgā, in order to offer him up in sacrifice, and, as it were, summoned Death with the sound of their gongs.
tatrāpaśyacca taṃ patnī sā pallīpatiputrikā / sundarī draṣṭumāyātā devīṃ bālasutānvitā //	There Sundarī saw him, one of his wives, the daughter of the chief of the village, who had come with her young son to visit the shrine of the goddess.
niṣiddhavatyā madhyasthāndasyūnānandapūrṇayā / sa śrīdattastayā sākaṃ tanmandiramathāviśat //	Full of joy she ordered the brigands who were between her and her husband to stand aside, and then Śrīdatta entered her palace with her.
tadaiva pallīrājyaṃ tat prāpa pitrā yad arpitam / prāg evānanyaputreṇa sundaryai gacchatā divam //	Immediately Śrīdatta obtained the sovereignty of that village, which Sundarī’s father, having no son, bequeathed to her when he went to heaven.
taṃ ca caurasamākrāntaṃ sapitṛvyaparicchadam / sakalatraṃ ca lebhe 'sau taṃ khaḍgaṃ ca mṛgāṅkakam //	So Śrīdatta recovered his wife and his sword Mṛgāṅka, and also his uncle and his followers, who had been overpowered by the robbers.
taraiva śūrasenasya sutāṃ tāṃ pariṇīya ca / śrīdatto 'pi mahānrājā nagare samapadyata //	And while he was in that town he married the daughter of Śūrasena, and became a great king there.
prajighāya sa dūtāṃśca tataḥ śvaśurayostayoḥ / bimbakestasya tasyāpi śūrasenasya bhūpateḥ // tamupājagmatustau ca senāsamudayānvitau / taṃ vijñāyaiva saṃbandhaṃ mudā duhitṛvatsalau // te 'pi rūḍhavraṇāḥ svasthāstadviyuktā vayasyakāḥ / bāhuśāliprabhṛtayastadbuddhvā tamupāyayuḥ //	And from that place he sent ambassadors to his two fathers-in-law, to Bimbaki and King Śūrasena. And they, being very fond of their daughters, gladly recognised him as a connection, and came to him accompanied by the whole of their armies. And his friends Bāhuśālin and the others, who had been separated from him, when they heard what had happened, came to him with their wounds healed and in good health.
atha śvaśurasaṃyukto gatvā taṃ pitṛghātinam / cakre vikramaśaktiṃ sa vīraḥ krodhānalāhutim //	Then the hero marched, united with his fathers-in-law, and made that Vikramaśakti, who had put his father to death, a burnt-offering in the flame of his wrath.
tataśca sābdhivalayāṃ śrīdattaḥ prāpya medinīm / nananda virahottīrṇaḥ sa mṛgāṅkavatīsakhaḥ //	And then Śrīdatta, having gained dominion over the sea-encircled earth, and deliverance from the sorrow’ of separation, joyed in the society of Mṛgāṅkavatī.
itthaṃ narapate dīrghaviyogavyasanārṇavam / taranti ca labhante ca kalyāṇaṃ dhīracetasaḥ //	Even so, my king, do men of firm resolution cross the calamitous sea of separation and obtain prosperity.
iti saṃgatakācchrutvā kathāṃ sa dayitotsukaḥ / tāṃ nināya niśāṃ mārge sahasrānīkabhūpatiḥ // tato manorathārūḍhaḥ puraḥ prahitamānasaḥ / prātaḥ sahasrānīko 'sau pratasthe svāṃ priyāṃ prati //	[M] (Main story line continued) After hearing this tale from Saṃgataka, the King Sahasrānīka, though longing for the sight of his beloved one, managed to get through that night on the journey. Then, engrossed with his desire, sending his thoughts on before, in the morning Sahasrānīka set out to meet his darling.
dinaiḥ katipayaistaṃ ca jamadagneravāpa saḥ / mṛgairapi parityaktacāpalaṃ śānamāśramam //	And in a few' days he reached that peaceful hermitage of Jamadagni, in which even the deer laid aside their wantonness.
dadarśa kalpitātithyaṃ jamadagniṃ ca tatra tam / praṇataḥ pāvanālokamākāraṃ tapasāmiva //	And there he beheld with reverence that Jamadagni, the sight of whom was sanctifying, like the incarnate form of penance, who received him hospitably.
sa ca tasmai munī rājñe saputrāṃ tāṃ samarpayat / cirānmṛgāvatīṃ rājñīṃ sānandāmiva nirvṛtim //	And the hermit handed over to him that Queen Mṛgāvatī with her son, regained by the king after long separation, like tranquillity with joy.
śāpānte tac ca daṃpatyostayor anyonyadarśanam / ānandabāṣpapūrṇāyāṃ vavarṣevāmṛtaṃ dṛśi //	And that sight which the husband and wife obtained of one another, now that the curse had ceased, rained, as it were, nectar into their eyes, which were filled with tears of joy.
tatpūrvadarśanaṃ putramāliṅgyodayanaṃ sa tam / mumoca nṛpatiḥ kṛcchrādromāñceneva kīlitam // tataḥ sodayanāṃ rājñīṃ tāmādāya mṛgāvatīm / ā tapovanamudvāṣpairanuyāto mṛgairapi // āmantrya jamadagniṃ ca pratasthe svāṃ purīṃ prati / praśāntādāśramāttasmātsahasrānīkabhūpatiḥ //	And the king embracing that son Udayana, whom he now beheld for the first time, could with difficulty let him go, as he was, so to speak, riveted to his body with his own hairs that stood erect from joy.[22] Then King Sahasrānīka took his Queen Mṛgāvatī with Udayana, and, bidding adieu to Jamadagni, set out from that tranquil hermitage for his own city, and even the deer followed him as far as the border of the hermitage with tearful eyes.
śṛṇvan virahavṛttāni priyāyā varṇayaṃś ca saḥ / uttoraṇapatākāṃ tāṃ kauśāmbīṃ prāptavān kramāt //	Beguiling the way by listening to the adventures of his beloved wife during the period of separation, and by relating his own, he at length reached the city of Kauśāmbī, in which triumphal arches were erected and banners displayed.
samaṃ ca patnīputrābhyāṃ praviveśa sa tāṃ purīm / pīyamāna ivotpakṣmarājibhiḥ pauralocanaiḥ //	And he entered that city in company with his wife and child, being, so to speak, devoured[23] by the eyes of the citizens, that had the fringe of their lashes elevated.
abhyaṣiñcacca taṃ tatra jhagityudayanaṃ sutam / yauvarājye mahārājaḥ preryamāṇaḥ sa tadguṇaiḥ //	And immediately the king appointed his son Udayana crown prince, being incited to it by his excellent qualities.
svamantriputrāṃs tasmai sa mantrahetoḥ samarpayat / vasantakarumaṇvantau tathā yaugandharāyaṇam //	And he assigned to him as advisers the sons of his own ministers, Vasantaka and Rumaṇvat and Yaugandharāyaṇa.
ebhirmantrivaraireṣa kṛtsnāṃ prāpsyati medinīm / iti vāgudabhūddivyā puṣpavṛṣṭyā samaṃ tadā // tataḥ sute nyastabharaḥ sa rājā cirakāṅkṣitam / jīvalokasukhaṃ bheje mṛgāvatyā tayā saha //	Then a rain of flowers fell, and a celestial voice was heard: “By the help of these excellent ministers, the prince shall obtain dominion over the whole earth.” Then the king devolved on his son the cares of empire, and enjoyed in the society of Mṛgāvatī the long-desired pleasures of the world.

tatas taṃ kalyāṇaṃ tanayam anuraktaprakṛtikaṃ niveśya sve rājye jagadudayahetor udayanam / sahasrānīko 'sau sacivasahitaḥ sapriyatamo mahāprasthānāya kṣitipatir agacchad dhimagirim //	Then that King Sahasrānīka established in his throne his excellent son Udayana,[25] whom the subjects loved so well, to ensure the world’s prosperity, and, accompanied by his ministers and his beloved wife, ascended the Himālaya to prepare for the last great journey.

kularūpānurūpā me bhāryā kvāpi na vidyate / ekā vāsavadattākhyā kanyakā śrūyate param // kathaṃ prāpyeta sā ceti cintāmekāmuvāha saḥ / so 'pi caṇḍamahāsena ujjayinyām acintayat // tulyo madduhiturbhartā jagatyasminna vidyate / asti codayano nāma vipakṣaḥ sa ca me sadā //	he kept thinking: “Nowhere is a wife found equal to me in birth and personal appearance; the maiden named Vāsavadattā alone has a liking for me,[4] but how is she to be obtained?” Caṇḍamahāsena also, in Ujjayinī, thought: “There is no suitable husband to be found for my daughter in the world, except one Udayana by name, and he has ever been my enemy.
tatkathaṃ nāma jāmātā vaśyaśca niyataṃ bhavet / upāyas tv eka evāsti yad aṭavyāṃ bhramaty asau //	Then how can I make him my son-in-law and my submissive ally? There is only one device which can effect it.
ekākī dviradān badhnan mṛgayāvyasanī nṛpaḥ / tena cchidreṇa taṃ yuktyāvaṣṭabhyānāyayāmy aham //	He wanders about alone in the forest capturing elephants, for he is a king addicted to the vice of hunting; I will make use of this failing of his to entrap him and bring him here by a stratagem;
gāndharvajñasya tasyaitāṃ sutāṃ śiṣyīkaromi ca / tataś cāsyāṃ svayaṃ tasya cakṣuḥ snihyed asaṃśayam // evaṃ sa mama jāmātā vaśyaś ca niyataṃ bhavet / nānyo 'styupāyaḥ ko 'pyatra yena vaśyo bhavecca saḥ // iti saṃcintya tatsiddhyai sa gatvā caṇḍikāgṛham / caṇḍīmabhyarcya tuṣṭāva cakre 'syā upayācitam //	and, as he is acquainted with music, I will make this daughter of mine his pupil, and then his eye will without doubt be charmed with her, and he will certainly become my son-in-law, and my obedient ally. No other artifice seems applicable in this case for making him submissive to my will.” Having thus reflected, he went to the temple of Durgā, in order that his scheme might be blessed with success, and, after worship and praise, offered a prayer to the goddess.

ityuktvā preṣitastena dūto gatvā nyavedayat / kauśāmbyāṃ vatsarājāya saṃdeśaṃ taṃ tathaiva saḥ //	if thou love us, come here and teach her.’” When sent off by the king with this message, the ambassador went and repeated it to the King of Vatsa in Kauśāmbī exactly as it was delivered;
vatsarājo 'pi tacchrutvā dūtādanucitaṃ vacaḥ / yaugandharāyaṇasyedamekānte mantriṇo 'bravīt // kimetattena saṃdiṣṭaṃ sadarpaṃ mama bhūbhujā / evaṃ saṃdiśatastasya ko 'bhiprāyo durātmanaḥ // ityukto vatsarājena tadā yaugandharāyaṇaḥ / uvācainaṃ mahāmantrīṃ sa svāmihitaniṣṭhuraḥ // bhuvi vyasanitākhyātiḥ prarūḍhā te lateva yā / idaṃ tasyā mahārāja kaṣāyakaṭukaṃ phalam //	and the King of Vatsa, after hearing this uncourteous message from the ambassador, repeated it in private to the minister Yaugandharāyaṇa, saying: “Why did that monarch send me that insolent message? What can be the villain’s object in making such a proposal?” When the king asked him this question, the great minister Yaugandharāyaṇa, who was stern to his master for his good, thus answered him: “Your reputation for vice[7] has shot up in the earth like a creeper, and this, O king, is its biting bitter fruit.
sa hi tvāṃ rāgiṇaṃ matvā kanyāratnena lobhayan / nītvā caṇḍamahāseno baddhvā svīkartumicchati //	For that King Caṇḍamahāsena, thinking that you are the slave of your passions, intends to ensnare you by means of his beautiful daughter, throw you into prison, and so make you his unresisting instrument.
ity ukto mantriṇā dhīraḥ pratidūtaṃ vyasarjayat / sa vatsarājas taṃ caṇḍamahāsenanṛpaṃ prati // saṃdideśa ca yadyasti vāñchā macchiṣyatāṃ prati / tvatputryāstadihaivaiṣā bhavatā preṣyatāmiti // evaṃ kṛtvā ca sacivānvatsarājo jagāda saḥ / yāmi caṇḍamahāsenamiha baddhvānayāmi tam // tac chrutvā tam uvācāgryo mantrī yaugandharāyaṇaḥ / na caitac chakyate rājan kartuṃ naiva ca yujyate //	Therefore abandon kingly vices, for kings that fall into them are easily captured by their enemies, even as elephants are taken in pits.” When his minister had said this to him, the resolute King of Vatsa sent in return an ambassador to Caṇḍamahāsena with the following reply: — “If thy daughter desires to become my pupil, then send her here.” When he had sent this reply, that King of Vatsa said to his ministers: “I will march and bring Caṇḍamahāsena here in chains.” When he heard that, the head minister Yaugandharāyaṇa said: “That is not a fitting thing to do, my king, nor is it in thy power to do it.

yasyāṃ vasati viśveśo mahākālavapuḥ svayam / śithilīkṛtakailāsanivāsavyasano haraḥ //	In that city dwells Śiva himself, the lord of existence, under the form of Mahākāla,[9] when he desists from the kingly vice of absenting himself on the heights of Mount Kailāsa.
tasyāṃ mahendravarmākhyo rājābhūdbhūbhṛtāṃ varaḥ / jayasenābhidhāno 'sya babhūva sadṛśaḥ sutaḥ //	In that city lived a king named Mahendravarman, best of monarchs, and he had a son like himself, named Jayasena.
jayasenasya tasyātha putro 'pratimadorbalaḥ / samutpanno mahāsenanāmā nṛpatikuñjaraḥ //	Then to that Jayasena was born a son named Mahāsena, matchless in strength of arm, an elephant among monarchs.

utkṛtyātha svamāṃsāni homakarma sa cākarot / tataḥ prasannā sākṣātsa devī caṇḍī tamabhyadhāt //	Then he cut off pieces of his own flesh and offered a burnt-offering with them, whereupon the goddess Durgā, being pleased, appeared in visible shape and said to him: “I am pleased with thee;
prītāsmi te gṛhāṇemaṃ putra khaḍgottamaṃ mama / etatprabhāvāc chatrūṇām ajeyas tvaṃ bhaviṣyasi //	receive from me this excellent sword; by means of its magic power thou shalt be invincible to all thy enemies.

But in the king there appeared joy at the fulfilment of his desire.
sa khaḍgo mattahastīndro naḍāgiririti prabho / dve tasya ratne śakrasya kuliśairāvaṇāviva //	He now possessed, O king, two jewels, his sword and a furious elephant named Naḍāgiri, which were to him what the thunderbolt and Airāvata are to Indra.
tayoḥ prabhāvātsukhitaḥ kadācitso 'tha bhūpatiḥ / agāccaṇḍamahāseno mṛgayāyai mahāṭavīm //	Then that king, delighting in the power of these two, one day went to a great forest to hunt;
atipramāṇaṃ tatraikaṃ varāhaṃ ghoramaikṣata / naiśaṃ tama ivākāṇḍe divā piṇḍatvamāgatam //	and there he beheld an enormous and terrible wild boar; like the darkness of the night suddenly condensed into a solid mass in the daytime.

The king, leaving that car of his, in revengeful pursuit of the boar, entered into that cavern with only his bow to aid him.
dūraṃ praviśya cāpaśyatkāntaṃ puravaraṃ mahat / savismayo nyaṣīdacca tadantardīrghikātaṭe //	And after he had gone a long distance he beheld a great and splendid capital, and astonished he sat down inside the city on the bank of a lake.
tatrasthaḥ kanyakāmekāmapaśyatstrīśatānvitām / saṃcarantīṃ smarasyeva dhairyanirbhedinīmiṣum //	While there he beheld a maiden moving along, surrounded by hundreds of women, like the arrow of love that cleaves the armour of self-restraint.

tacchrutvā netrayugalātsarāgādaśrusaṃtatim / hṛdayāddhīratāṃ cāpi samaṃ kanyā mumoca sā //	hearing which, she let fall from her eyes a passionate flood of tears, and from her heart all self-control.

And I am his daughter, O king, and my name is Aṅgāravatī.
vajrasāramayaś cāsau rājaputrīr imāḥ śatam / ācchidya rājñāṃ gehebhyaḥ parivāraṃ vyadhān mama //	And he is of adamantine frame, and has carried off these hundred princesses from the palaces of kings and appointed them to attend on me.

idānīṃ cāstavārāharūpo viśrāmyati svayam / suptotthitaśca niyataṃ tvayi pāpaṃ samācaret //	At present he has put off the form of a boar and is resting in his proper shape, but when he wakes up from his sleep he will without fail do you an injury.

prabuddhasyāsya gatvā tvaṃ rudihi svapituḥ puraḥ / tataśca niyataṃ sa tvāṃ pṛcchedudvegakāraṇam //	When your father awakes, go and weep in front of him, and then he will certainly ask you the cause of your agitation;

taṃ ca cchannamavasthāpya rājānaṃ pāpaśaṅkinī / agādasurakanyā sa prasuptasyāntikaṃ pituḥ //	And that Asura maiden, apprehending misfortune, placed the king in concealment and went near her sleeping father.
so 'pi daiyaḥ prabubudhe prārebhe sā ca roditum / kiṃ putri rodiṣītyevaṃ sa ca tāmabravīttataḥ // hanyāttvāṃ ko'pi cettāta tadā me kā gatirbhavet / ityārtyā tamavāditsā sa vihasya tato 'bravīt // ko māṃ vyāpādayetputri sarvo vajramayo hyaham / vāmahaste 'sti me chidraṃ tacca cāpena rakṣyate //	Then the Daitya woke up, and she began to weep. And then he said to her: “Why do you weep, my daughter?” She, with affected grief, said to him: “If someone were to slay thee, what would become of me?” Then he burst out laughing and said: “Who could possibly slay me, my daughter?—for I am cased in adamant all over;
itthamāśvāsayāmāsa sa daityastāṃ nijāṃ sutām / etacca nikhilaṃ tena rājñā channena śuśruve //	only in my left hand is there an unguarded place, but that is protected by the bow.” In these words the Daitya consoled his daughter, and all this was heard by the king in his concealment.
tataḥ kṣaṇādivotthāya kṛtvā snānaṃ sa dānavaḥ / kṛtamaunaḥ pravavṛtte devaṃ pūjayituṃ haram //	Immediately afterwards the Dānava rose up and took his bath, and proceeded in devout silence to worship the god Śiva.
tatkālaṃ prakaṭībhūya sa rājākṛṣṭakārmukaḥ / upetya prasabhaṃ daityaṃ raṇāyāhvayate sma tam //	At that moment the king appeared with his bow bent, and rushing up impetuously towards the Daitya, challenged him to fight.
rājāpi laghuhastatvātkare tatraiva tatkṣaṇam / tasminmarmaṇi taṃ daityaṃ pṛṣatkena jaghāna saḥ //	The king for his part, being very quick, immediately smote him with an arrow in that hand which was his vital part.

pariṇītavatastasya tatra tāṃ daityakanyakām / jātau dvau tanayau caṇḍamahāsenasya bhūpateḥ // eko gopālako nāma dvitīyaḥ pālakastathā / tayorindrotsavaṃ cāsau jātayorakaronnṛpaḥ //	There the king Caṇḍamahāsena married that Daitya maiden, and two sons were born to him, the first named Gopālaka and the second Pālaka; and when they were born he held a feast in honour of Indra on their account.
tatastaṃ nṛpatiṃ svapne tuṣṭo vakti sma vāsavaḥ / prāpsyasyananyasadṛśīṃ matprasādātsutāmiti // tataḥ kālena jātāsya rājñaḥ kanyā tu tanvyatha / apūrvā nirmitā dhātrā candrasyevāparā tanuḥ // kāmadevāvatāro 'syāḥ putro vidyādharādhipaḥ / bhaviṣyatīti tatkālamudabhūdbhāratī divaḥ // dattā me vāsavenaiṣā tuṣṭeneti sa bhūpatiḥ / nāmnā vāsavadattāṃ tāṃ tanayāmakarottadā //	Then Indra, being pleased, said to that king in a dream: “By my favour thou shalt obtain a matchless daughter.” Then in course of time a graceful daughter was born to that king, like a second and more wonderful shape of the moon made by the Creator. And on that occasion a voice was heard from heaven: “She shall give birth to a son, who shall be a very incarnation of the God of Love, and king of the Vidyādharas.” Then the king gave that daughter the name of Vāsavadattā, because she was given by Indra being pleased with him.
sā ca tasya pitur gehe pradeyā saṃprati sthitā / prāṅmanthād arṇavasyeva kamalā kukṣikoṭare //	[M] (Main story line continued) And that maiden still remains unmarried in the house of her father, like the Goddess of Prosperity in the hollow cavity of the ocean before it was churned.
evaṃvidhaprabhāvaścaṇḍamahāsenabhūpatiḥ sa kila / deva na śakyo jetuṃ yathā tathā durgadeśasthaḥ //	That King Caṇḍamahāsena cannot indeed be conquered by you, O king; in the first place, because he is so powerful, and, in the next place, because his realm is situated in a difficult country.
kiṃ ca sa rājanvāñchati dātuṃ tubhyaṃ sadaiva tanayāṃ tām / prārthayate tu sa rājā nijapakṣamahodayaṃ mānī //	Moreover, he is ever longing to give you that daughter of his in marriage, but, being a proud monarch, he desires the triumph of himself and his adherents.

so 'pi caṇḍamahāsenastacchrutvaiva vyacintayat / sa tāvadiha nāyāti mānī vatseśvaro bhṛśam //	Caṇḍamahāsena for his part, on hearing it, began to reflect: “It is certain that that proud King of Vatsa will not come here.
kanyā hi tatra na preṣyā bhavedevaṃ hi lāghavam / tasmādbaddhvaiva taṃ yuktyā nṛpamānāyayāmyaham //	And I cannot send my daughter to his Court; such conduct would be unbecoming;

tatra taṃ cārapuruṣāḥ paśyanti sma vidūrataḥ / gajabandharasāsaktavatsarājopajīvinaḥ //	There the scouts kept in his pay by the King of Vatsa, who was passionately fond of the sport of elephant-catching, discerned it from a distance[1];

taṃ cedgajendraṃ prāpsyāmi pratimallaṃ naḍāgireḥ / tataścaṇḍamahāseno vaśyo bhavati me dhruvam // tato vāsavadattāṃ tāṃ sa svayaṃ me prayacchati / iti saṃcintayanso 'tha rājā tāmanayanniśām // prātaśca mantrivacanaṃ nyakṛtvā gajatṛṣṇayā / puraskṛtyaiva tāṃścārānyayau vindhyāṭavīṃ prati //	The king spent that night in thinking: “If I obtain that mighty elephant, a fit match for Naḍāgiri, then that Caṇḍamahāsena will certainly be in my power, and then he will of his own accord give me his daughter Vāsavadattā.” So in the morning he started for the Vindhya forest, making these scouts show him the way, disregarding, in his ardent desire to capture the elephant, Elephant the advice of his ministers.
prasthānalagnasya phalaṃ kanyālābhaṃ sabandhanam / yadūcurgaṇakāstasya tatsa naiva vyacārayat //	He did not pay any attention to the fact that the astrologers said that the position of the heavenly bodies at the moment of his departure portended the acquisition of a maiden together with imprisonment.
prāpya vindhyāṭavīṃ tasya gajasya kṣobhaśaṅkayā / vatsarājaḥ sa sainyāni dūrādeva nyavārayat // cāramātrasahāyastu vīṇāṃ ghoṣavatīṃ dadhat / nijavyasanavistīrṇāṃ tāṃ viveśa mahāṭavīm //	When the King of Vatsa reached the Vindhya forest he made his troops halt at a distance, through fear of alarming that elephant, and, accompanied by the scouts only, holding in his hand his melodious lute, he entered that great forest boundless as his own kingly vice.
vindhyasya dakṣiṇe pārśve dūrācāraiḥ pradarśitam / gajaṃ satyagajābhāsaṃ taṃ dadarśa sa bhūpatiḥ //	The king saw on the southern slope of the Vindhya range that elephant looking like a real one, pointed out to him by his scouts from a distance.
ekākī vādayanvīṇāṃ cintayan bandhanāni saḥ / madhuradhvani gāyaṃś ca śanair upajagāma tam //	He slowly approached it, alone, playing on his lute, thinking how he should bind it, and singing in melodious tones.
gāndharvadattacittatvātsaṃdhyādhvāntavaśācca saḥ / na taṃ vanagajaṃ rājā māyāgajamalakṣayat //	As his mind was fixed on his music, and the shades of evening were setting in, that king did not perceive that the supposed elephant was an artificial one.
so 'pi hastī tamutkarṇatālo gītarasādiva / upetyopetya vicalandūramākṛṣṭavānnṛpam // tato 'kasmācca nirgatya tasmādyantramayādgajāt / vatseśvaraṃ taṃ saṃnaddhāḥ puruṣāḥ paryavārayan // tāndṛṣṭvā nṛpatiḥ kopādākṛṣṭacchuriko 'tha saḥ / agrasthānyodhayannanyairetya paścādagṛhyata //	The elephant,[2] too, for its part, lifting up its ears and flapping them, as if through delight in the music, kept advancing and then retiring, and so drew the king to a great distance. And then, suddenly issuing from that artificial elephant, a body of soldiers in full armour surrounded that King of Vatsa. When he beheld them, the king in a rage drew his hunting-knife, but while he was fighting with those in front of him he was seized by others coming up behind.
saṃketamilitaiścānyairyodhāstaiḥ sainikaiḥ saha / ninyurvatseśvaraṃ caṇḍamahāsenāntikaṃ ca tam // so 'pi caṇḍamahāseno nirgayāgre kṛtādaraḥ / vatseśena samaṃ tena viveśojjayinīṃ purīm //	And those warriors, with the help of others, who appeared at a concerted signal, carried that King of Vatsa into the presence of Caṇḍamahāsena. Caṇḍamahāsena for his part came out to meet him with the utmost respect, and entered with him the city of Ujjayinī.
sa tatra tadṛśe paurairavamānakalaṅkitaḥ / śaśīva locanānando vatsarājo navāgataḥ //	Then the newly arrived King of Vatsa was beheld by the citizens, like the moon, pleasing to the eyes, though spotted with humiliation.
tato 'sya guṇarāgeṇa vadhamāśaṅkya tatra te / paurāḥ saṃbhūya sakalāścakrurmaraṇaniścayam // na me vatseśvaro vadhyaḥ saṃdheya iti tān bruvan / so 'tha caṇḍamahāsenaḥ paurān kṣobhād avārayat //	Then all the citizens, suspecting that he was to be put to death, through regard for his virtues assembled and determined to commit suicide.[3] Then the King Caṇḍamahāsena put a stop to the agitation of the citizens by informing them that he did not intend to put the monarch of Vatsa to death, but to win him over.
tato vāsavadattāṃ tāṃ sutāṃ tatraiva bhūpatiḥ / vatsarājāya gāndharvaśikṣāhetoḥ samarpayat //	So the king made over his daughter Vāsavadattā on the spot to the King of Vatsa to be taught music, and said to him: “Prince, teach this lady music;
uvāca cainaṃ gāndharvaṃ tvametāṃ śikṣaya prabho / tataḥ prāpsyasi kalyāṇaṃ mā viṣādaṃ kṛthā iti //	in this way you will obtain a happy issue to your adventure;
tasya dṛṣṭvā tu tāṃ kanyāṃ vatsarājasya mānasam / tathā snehāktamabhavanna yahā manyumaikṣata //	do not despond.” But when he beheld that fair lady the mind of the King of Vatsa was so steeped in love that he put out of sight his anger;
tasyāś ca cakṣurmanasī saha taṃ prati jagmatuḥ / hriyā cakṣur nivavṛtte manas tu na kathaṃcana //	and her heart and mind turned towards him together; her eye was then averted through modesty, but her mind not at all.
atha vāsavadattāṃ tāṃ gāpayaṃstadgatekṣaṇaḥ / tatra gāndharvaśālāyāṃ vatsarāja uvāsa saḥ //	So the King of Vatsa dwelt in the concert-room of Caṇḍamahāsena’s palace, teaching Vāsavadattā to sing, with his eyes fixed ever on her.
aṅke ghoṣavatī tasya kaṇṭhe gītaśrutistathā / puro vāsavadattā ca tasthau cetovinodinī //	In his lap was his lute, in his throat the quarter-tone of vocal music, and in front of him stood Vāsavadattā, delighting his heart.
sā ca vāsavadattāsya paricaryāparābhavat / takṣmīriva tadekāgrā baddhasyāpyanapāyinī //	And that princess was devoted in her attentions to him, resembling the Goddess of Fortune in that she was firmly attached to him, and did not leave him though he was a captive.
atrāntare ca kauśāmbyāṃ vatsarājānuge jane / āvṛtte taṃ prabhuṃ buddhvā baddhaṃ rāṣṭraṃ pracukṣubhe //	In the meanwhile the men who had accompanied the king returned to Kauśāmbī, and the country, hearing of the captivity of the monarch, was thrown into a state of great excitement.
ujjayinyāmavaskandaṃ dātumaicchansamantataḥ / vatseśvarānurāgeṇa kruddhāḥ prakṛtayastadā //	Then the enraged subjects, out of love for the King of Vatsa, wanted to make a general[4] assault on Ujjayinī.
naiva caṇḍamahāseno balasādhyo mahān hi saḥ / na caivaṃ vatsarājasya śarīre kuśalaṃ bhavet // tasmānna yukto 'vaskando buddhisādhyamidaṃ punaḥ / iti prakṛtayaḥ kṣobhānnavāryanta rumaṇvatā //	But Rumaṇvat checked the impetuous fury of the subjects by telling them that Caṇḍamahāsena was not to be overcome by force, for he was a mighty monarch, and besides that an assault was not advisable, for it might endanger the safety of the King of Vatsa;
tato 'nuraktamālokya rāṣṭramavyabhicāri tat / rumaṇvadādīn āha sma dhīro yaugandharāyaṇaḥ // ihaiva sarvair yuṣmābhiḥ sthātavyaṃ satatodyataiḥ / rakṣaṇīyamidaṃ rāṣṭraṃ kāle kāryaśca vikramaḥ //	The calm and resolute Yaugandharāyaṇa, seeing that the country was loyal, and would not swerve from its allegiance, said to Rumaṇvat and the others: “All of you must remain here, ever on the alert; you must guard this country, and when a fit occasion comes you must display your prowess;
vasantakadvitīyaśca gatvāhaṃ prajñayā svayā / vatseśaṃ mocayitvā tamānayāmi na saṃśayaḥ //	but I will go, accompanied by Vasantaka only, and will without fail accomplish by my wisdom the deliverance of the king and bring him home.
jalāhatau viśeṣeṇa vaidyutāgneriva dyutiḥ / āpadi sphurati prajñā yasya dhīraḥ sa eva hi //	For he is a truly firm and resolute man, whose wisdom shines forth in adversity, as the lightning flash is especially brilliant during pelting rain.
prākārabhañjanānyogāṃstathā nigaḍabhañjanān / adarśanaprayogāṃśca jāne 'hamupayoginaḥ // ityuktvā prakṛtīḥ kṛtvā hastanyastā rumaṇvataḥ / yaugandharāyaṇaḥ prāyāt kauśāmbyāḥ savasantakaḥ //	I know spells for breaking through walls, and for rending fetters, and receipts for becoming invisible, serviceable at need.” Having said this, and entrusted to Rumaṇvat the care of the subjects, Yaugandharāyaṇa set out for Kauśāmbī with Vasantaka.
praviveśa ca tenaiva saha vindhyamahāṭavīm / svaprajñāmiva sattāḍhyāṃ svanītimiva durgamām //	And with him he entered the Vindhya forest, full of life,[5] like his wisdom, intricate and trackless as his policy.
tatra vatseśamittrasya vindhyaprāgbhāravāsinaḥ / gṛhaṃ pulindakākhyasya pulindādhipateragāt //	Then he visited the palace of the King of the Pulindas, Pulindaka by name, who dwelt on a peak of the Vindhya range, and was an ally of the King of Vatsa.
taṃ sajjaṃ sthāpayitvā ca pahā tenāgamiṣyataḥ / vatsarājasya rakṣārthaṃ bhūrisainyasamanvitam // gatvā vasantakasakhastato yaugandharāyaṇaḥ / ujjayinyāṃ mahākālaśmaśānaṃ prāpa sa kramāt // viveśa tacca vetālaiḥ kravyagandhibhirāvṛtam / itastatastamaḥ śyāmaiścitādhūmairivāparaiḥ //	He first placed him, with a large force at his heels, in readiness to protect the King of Vatsa when he returned that way, and then he went on, accompanied by Vasantaka, and at last arrived at the burning-ground of Mahākāla in Ujjayinī, which was densely tenanted by vampires[6] that smelt of carrion, and hovered hither and thither, black as night, rivalling the smoke-wreaths of the funeral pyres.
tatrainaṃ darśanaprīto mittrabhāvāya tatkṣaṇam / yogeśvarākhyo vṛtavānabhyetya brahmarākṣasaḥ //	And there a Brāhman-Rākṣasa[7] of the name of Yogeśvara immediately came up to him, delighted to see him, and admitted him into his friendship;
tenopadiṣṭayā yuktyā tato yaugandharāyaṇaḥ / na cakārātmanaḥ sadyo rūpasya parivartanam //	then Yaugandharāyaṇa by means of a charm, which he taught him, suddenly altered his shape.
babhūva tena vikṛtaḥ kubjo vṛddhaśca tatkṣaṇāt / unmattaveṣaḥ khalvāṭo hāsyasaṃjananaḥ param // tayaiva yuktyā sa tadā sirānaddhapṛthūdaram / cakre vasantakasyāpi rūpaṃ danturadurmukham //	That charm immediately made him deformed, hunchbacked and old, and besides gave him the appearance of a madman, so that he produced loud laughter in those who beheld him.[8] And in the same way Yaugandharāyaṇa, by means of that very charm, gave Vasantaka a body full of outstanding veins, with a large stomach, and an ugly mouth with projecting teeth;
tato rājakuladvāramādau preṣya vasantakam / viveśojjayinīṃ tāṃ sa tādṛgyaugandharāyaṇaḥ //	then he sent Vasantaka on in front to the gate of the king’s palace, and entered Ujjayinī with such an appearance as I have described.
nṛtyan gāyaṃś ca tatrāsau baṭubhiḥ parivāritaḥ / dṛṣṭaḥ sakautukaṃ sarvairyayau rājagṛhaṃ prati //	There he, singing and dancing, surrounded by Brāhman boys, beheld with curiosity by all, made his way to the king’s palace.
tatra rājāvarodhānāṃ tenāsau kṛtakautukaḥ / agādvāsavadattāyāḥ śanaiḥ śravaṇagocaram //	And there he excited by that behaviour the curiosity of the king’s wives, and was at last heard of by Vāsavadattā.
sā tamānāyayāmāsa ceṭikāṃ preṣya satvaram / gāndharvaśālāṃ narmaikasādaraṃ hi navaṃ vayaḥ // sa ca tatra gato vṛddhaṃ vatsarājaṃ dadarśa tam / unmattaveṣo vigaladvāṣpo yaugandharāyaṇaḥ //	She quickly sent a maid and had him brought to the concert-room. For youth is twin brother to mirth.[9] And when Yaugandharāyaṇa came there and beheld the King of Vatsa in fetters, though he had assumed the appearance of a madman, he could not help shedding tears.
cakāra tasmai saṃjñāṃ ca vatsarājāya so 'pi tam / pratyabhijñātavānrājā veṣapracchannamāgatam //	And he made a sign to the King of Vatsa, who quickly recognised him, though he had come in disguise.
tato vāsavadattāṃ ca tacceṭīḥ prati cātmanaḥ / adarśanaṃ yuktibalād vyadhād yaugandharāyaṇaḥ //	Then Yaugandharāyaṇa by means of his magic power made himself invisible to Vāsavadattā and her maids.
rājā tveko dadarśainaṃ tāśca sarvāḥ savismayam / vadanti sma gato 'kasmādunmattaḥ kvāpyasāviti // tacchrutvā taṃ ca dṛṣṭāgre matvā yogabalena tat / yuktyā vāsavadattāṃ tāṃ vatsarājo 'bravīdidam // gatvā sarasvatīpūjāmādāyāgaccha dārike / tacchrutvā sā tathetyuktvā savayasyā viniryayau //	So the king alone saw him, and they all said with astonishment: “That maniac has suddenly escaped somewhere or other.” Then the King of Vatsa hearing them say that, and seeing Yaugandharāyaṇa in front of him, understood that this was due to magic, and cunningly said to Vāsavadattā: “Go, my good girl, and bring the requisites for the worship of Sarasvatī.” When she heard that she said, “So I will,” and went out with her companions.
yathocitamupetyātha dadau vatseśvarāya saḥ / yaugandharāyaṇas tasmai yogān nigaḍabhañjanān //	Then Yaugandharāyaṇa approached the king and communicated to him, according to the prescribed form, spells for breaking chains;
anyānvāsavadattāyā vīṇātantrīniyojitān / vaśīkaraṇayogāṃśca rājñe 'smai sa samārpayat //	and at the same time he furnished him with other charms for winning the heart of Vāsavadattā, which were attached to the strings of the lute;
vyajijñapacca taṃ rājannihāyāto vasantakaḥ / dvāri sthito 'nyarūpeṇa taṃ kuruṣvāntike dvijam //	and informed him that Vasantaka had come there and was standing outside the door in a changed form, and recommended him to have that Brāhman summoned to him.
yadā vāsavadatteyaṃ tvayi visrambhameṣyati / tadā vakṣyāmi yadahaṃ tatkuryāstiṣṭha sāṃpratam //	At the same time he said: “When this lady Vāsavadattā shall come to repose confidence in you, then you must do what I tell you;
ityuktvā niryayau śīghraṃ tato yaugandharāyaṇaḥ / agādvāsavadattā ca pūjāmādāya tatkṣaṇāt //	at the present remain quiet.” Having said this, Yaugandharāyaṇa quickly went out, and immediately Vāsavadattā entered with the requisites for the worship of Sarasvatī.
so 'tha tāmavadadrājā bahirdvāri dvijaḥ sthitaḥ / sarasvatyarcane so 'smindakṣiṇārthe praveśyatām // tatheti dvāradeśātsa tatra vāsavadattayā / virūpāmākṛtiṃ bibhradānāyyata vasantakaḥ // sa cānītastamālokya vatseśamarudacchucā / tataścāpratibhedāya sa rājā nijagāda tam //	Then the king said to her: “There is a Brāhman standing outside the door, let him be brought in to celebrate this ceremony in honour of Sarasvatī, in order that he may obtain a sacrificial fee.” Vāsavadattā consented, and had Vasantaka, who wore a deformed shape, summoned from the door into the music-hall. And when he was brought and saw the King of Vatsa, he wept for sorrow;
he brahmanrogavairūpyaṃ sarvametadahaṃ tava / nivārayāmi mā rodīstiṣṭhehaiva mamāntike //	and then the king said to him, in order that the secret might not be discovered: “O Brāhman, I will remove all this deformity of thine produced by sickness;
mahān prasādo deveti sa covāca vasantakaḥ / so 'tha taṃ vikṛtaṃ dṛṣṭvā rājā smitamukho 'bhavat //	And when he saw that, Vasantaka guessed what was in the king’s mind, and laughed so that the deformity of his distorted face was increased;
taṃ hasantaṃ tathā dṛṣṭvā krīḍanīyakasaṃnibham / tatra vāsavadattāpi jahāsa ca tutoṣa ca //	and thereupon Vāsavadattā, beholding him grinning like a doll, burst out laughing also, and was much delighted.
tataḥ sā narmaṇā bālā taṃ papraccha vasantakam / kiṃ vijñānaṃ vijānāsi bho brahman kathyatām iti // kathāḥ kathayituṃ devi jānāmīti sa cāvadat / kathāṃ kathaya tarhokāmiti sāpi tato 'bravīt // tatastāṃ rājatanayāṃ rañjayansa vasantakaḥ / hāsyavaicitrasarasām imām akathayat kathām //	Then the young lady asked Vasantaka in fun the following question:— “Brāhman, what science are you familiar with? Tell us.” So he said: “Princess, I am an adept at telling tales.” Then she said: “Come, tell me a tale.” Then, in order to please that princess, Vasantaka told the following tale, which was charming by its comic humour and variety.
astīha mathurā nāma purī kaṃsārijanmabhūḥ / tasyāṃ rūpaṇiketyāsītkhyātā vāravilāsinī //	There is in this country a city named Mathurā, the bith-place of Kṛṣṇa; in it there was a courtesan known by the name of Rūpiṇikā;
tasyā makaradaṃṣṭrākhyā mātābhūdvṛddhakuṭṭanī / tadguṇākṛṣyamāṇānāṃ yūnāṃ dṛśi viṣacchaṭā //	she had for a mother an old bawd named Makaradaṃṣṭrā, who seemed a lump of poison in the eyes of the young men attracted by her daughter’s charms.
pūjākāle surakulaṃ svaniyogāya jātu sā / gatā rūpaṇikā dūrādekaṃ puruṣamaikṣata //	One day Rūpiṇikā went at the time of worship to the temple to perform her duty,[10] and beheld from a distance a young man.
sa dṛṣṭaḥ subhagastasyā viveśa hṛdayaṃ tathā / yathā mātrā kṛtāste 'smādupadeśā viniryayuḥ //	When she saw that handsome young fellow, he made such an impression upon her heart that all her mother’s instructions vanished from it.
ceṭikāmatha sāvādīdgaccha madvacanādamum / puruṣaṃ brūhi madgehe tvayādyāgamyatāmiti // tatheti ceṭikā sā ca gatvā tasmai tad abravīt / tataḥ sa kiṃcid vimṛśan puruṣas tām abhāṣata //	Then she said to her maid: “Go and tell this man from me that he is to come to my house to-day.” The maid said, “So I will,” and immediately went and told him. Then the man thought a little and said to her: “I am a Brāhman named Lohajaṅgha[11];
lohajaṅghābhidhāno 'smi brāhmaṇo nāsti me dhanam / tadāḍhyajanalabhye hi ko 'haṃ rūpaṇikāgṛhe // na dhanaṃ vāñchyate tvattaḥ svāminyetyudite tayā / sa lohajaṅghas tadvākyaṃ tatheti pratyapadyata //	I have no wealth; then what business have I in the house of Rūpiṇikā, which is only to be entered by the rich?” The maid said: “My mistress does not desire wealth from you.” Whereupon Lohajaṅgha consented to do as she wished.
tataśceṭīmukhādbuddhvā tacca sā gṛhamutsukā / gatvā rūpaṇikā tatsthau tanmārganyastalocanā //	When she heard that from the maid, Rūpiṇikā went home in a state of excitement, and remained with her eyes fixed on the path by which he would come.
kṣaṇācca lohajaṅgho 'tha tasyāmandiramāyayau / kuto 'yamiti kuṭṭanyā dṛṣṭo makaradaṃṣṭrayā //	And soon Lohajaṅgha came to her house, while the bawd Makaradaṃṣṭrā looked at him, and wondered where he came from.
sāpi rūpaṇikā dṛṣṭvā svayamutthāya sādarā / vāsaveśmāntaraṃ hṛṣṭā kaṇṭhe lagnā nināya tam //	Rūpiṇikā for her part, when she saw him, rose up to meet him herself with the utmost respect, and clinging to his neck in her joy led him to her own private apartments.
tatra sā lohajaṅghasya tasya saubhāgyasaṃpadā / vaśīkṛtā satī nānyatphalaṃ janmanyamanyata //	Then she was captivated with Lohajaṅgha’s wealth of accomplishments, and considered that she had been only born to love him.
tatastayā nivṛttānyapuruṣāsaṅgayā saha / yathāsukhaṃ sa tatraiva tasthau tanmandire yuvā //	So she avoided the society of other men, and that young fellow lived with her in her house in great comfort.
taddṛṣṭvā śikṣitāśeṣaveṣayoṣijjagāda tām / mātā makaradaṃṣṭrā sā khinnā rūpaṇikāṃ rahaḥ // kimayaṃ nirdhanaḥ putri sevyate puruṣastvayā / śavaṃ spṛśanti sujanā gaṇikā na tu nirdhanam //	Rūpiṇikā’s mother Makaradaṃṣṭrā, who had trained up many courtesans, was annoyed when she saw this, and said to her in private: “My daughter, why do you associate with a poor man? Courtesans of good taste embrace a corpse in preference to a poor man.
kānurāgaḥ kva veśyātvamiti te vismṛtaṃ katham / saṃdhyeva rāgiṇī veśyā na ciraṃ putri dīpyate //	What business has a courtesan like you with affection?[12] How have you come to forget that great principle? The light of a red[13] sunset lasts but a short time, and so does the splendour of a courtesan who gives way to affection.
naṭīva kṛtrimaṃ prema gaṇikārthāya darśayet / tadenaṃ nirdhanaṃ muñca mā kṛthā nāśamātmanaḥ // iti mātṛvacaḥ śrutvā ruṣā rūpaṇikābravīt / maivaṃ vādīrmama hyeṣa prāṇebhyo 'pyadhikaḥ priyaḥ //	A courtesan, like an actress, should exhibit an assumed affection in order to get wealth; so forsake this pauper, do not ruin yourself.” When she heard this speech of her mother’s, Rūpiṇikā said in a rage: “Do not talk in this way, for I love him more than my life.
dhanamasti ca me bhūri kimanyena karomyaham / tadamba naiva vaktavyā bhūyo 'pyevamahaṃ tvayā // tacchrutvā lohajaṅghasya nirvāsanavidhau krudhā / tasthau makaradaṃṣṭrā sā tasyopāyaṃ vicinvatī //	And as for wealth, I have plenty, what do I want with more? So you must not speak to me again, mother, in this way.” When she heard this, Makaradaṃṣṭrā was in a rage, and she remained thinking over some device for getting rid of this Lohajaṅgha.
atha mārgāgataṃ kaṃcitkṣīṇakoṣaṃ dadarśa sā / rājaputraṃ parivṛtaṃ puruṣaiḥ śastrapāṇibhiḥ //	Then she saw coming along the road a certain Rājpūt, who had spent all his wealth, surrounded by retainers with swords in their hands.
upagamya drutaṃ taṃ ca nītvaikānte jagāda sā / nirdhanena mamaikena kāmukenāvṛtaṃ gṛham //	So she went up to him quickly and, taking him aside, said: “My house is beset by a certain poor lover.
tattvamāgaccha tatrādya tathā ca kuru yena saḥ / gṛhānmama nivarteta madīyāṃ ca sutāṃ bhaja // tatheti rājaputro 'tha praviveśa sa tadgṛham / tasmin kṣaṇe rūpaṇikā tasthau devakule ca sā //	So come there yourself to-day, and take such order with him that he shall depart from my house, and do you possess my daughter.” “Agreed,” said the Rājpūt, and entered that house.
lohajaṅghaśca tatkālaṃ bahiḥ kvāpi sthito 'bhavat / kṣaṇāntare ca niḥśaṅkastatraiva samupāyayau //	At that precise moment Rūpiṇikā was in the temple, and Lohajaṅgha meanwhile was absent somewhere, and, suspecting nothing, he returned to the house a moment afterwards.
tatkṣaṇaṃ rājaputrasya tasya bhṛtyaiḥ pradhāvya saḥ / dṛḍhaṃ pādaprahārādyaiḥ sarveṣvaṅgeṣv atāḍyata // tatas tair eva cāmedhyapūrṇe kṣiptaḥ sa khātake / lohajaṅghaḥ kathamapi prapalāyitavāṃstataḥ //	Immediately the retainers of the Rājpūt ran upon him, and gave him severe kicks and blows on all his limbs, and then they threw him into a ditch full of all kinds of impurities, and Lohajaṅgha with difficulty escaped from it.
athāgatā rūpaṇikā tadbuddhvā śokavihvalā / sābhūdvīkṣyātha sa yayau rājaputro yathāgatam //	Then Rūpiṇikā returned to the house, and when she heard what had taken place she was distracted with grief, so the Rājpūt, seeing that, returned as he came.
lohajaṅgho 'pi kuṭṭanyā prasahya sa khalīkṛtaḥ / gantuṃ pravavṛte tīrthaṃ prāṇāṃstyaktuṃ viyogavān // gacchannaṭavyāṃ saṃtaptaḥ kuṭṭanīmanyunā hṛdi / tvaci ca grīṣmatāpena cchāyāmabhilalāṣa saḥ //	Lohajaṅgha, after suffering this brutal outrage by the machinations of the bawd, set out for some holy place of pilgrimage, in order to leave his life there, now that he was separated from his beloved. As he was going along in the wild country,[14] with his heart burning with anger against the bawd, and his skin with the heat of the summer, he longed for shade.
tarumaprāpnuvanso 'tha lebhe hastikalevaram / jaghanena praviśyāntarnirmāṃsaṃ jambukaiḥ kṛtam // carmāvaśeṣe tatrāntaḥ pariśrānaḥ praviśya saḥ / lohajaṅgho yayau nidrāṃ praviśadvātaśītale //	Not being able to find a tree, he lighted on the body of an elephant which had been stripped of all its flesh[15] by jackals making their way into it by the hind-quarters; accordingly Lohajaṅgha, being worn out, crept into this carcass, which was a mere shell, as only the skin remained, and went to sleep in it, as it was kept cool by the breeze which freely entered.
athākasmātsamutthāya kṣaṇenaiva samantataḥ / meghaḥ pravavṛte tatra dhārāsāreṇa varṣitum //	Then suddenly clouds arose from all sides and began to pour down a pelting shower of rain;
tena nirvivaraṃ prāpa saṃkocaṃ hasticarma tat / kṣaṇācca tena mārgeṇa jalaugho bhṛśamāyayau // tenāpahṛtya gaṅgāyāmakṣepi gajacarma tat / tajjalaughena nītvā ca samudrāntarnyadhīyata //	that rain made the elephant’s skin contract so that no aperture was left,[16] and immediately a copious inundation came that way, and carrying off the elephant’s hide swept it into the Ganges, so that eventually the inundation bore it into the sea.
tatra dṛṣṭvā ca taccarma nipatyāmiṣaśaṅkayā / hṛtvābdheḥ pāramanayatpakṣī garuḍavaṃśajaḥ //	And there a bird of the race of Garuḍa saw that hide and, supposing it to be carrion, took it to the other side of the sea;
tatra cañcvā vidāryaitad gajacarma vilokya ca / antaḥsthaṃ mānuṣaṃ pakṣī palāyya sa tato yayau //	there it tore open the elephant’s hide with its claws and, seeing that there was a man inside it, fled away.
tataśca carmaṇastasmātpakṣisaṃrambhabodhitaḥ / taccañcuracitadvārāllohajaṅgho viniryayau //	But Lohajaṅgha was awaked by the bird’s pecking and scratching, and came out through the aperture made by its beak.
dṛṣṭvā samudrapārasthamātmānaṃ ca savismayaḥ / anidrasvapnamiva tat sa samagram amanyata //	And finding that he was on the other side of the sea, he was astonished, and looked upon the whole thing as a daydream;
atha dvau rākṣasau tatra ghorau bhīto dadarśa saḥ / tau cāpi rākṣasau dūrāccakitau tamapaśyatām //	then he saw there to his terror two horrible Rākṣasas, and those two for their part contemplated him from a distance with feelings of fear.
rāmātparābhavaṃ smṛtvā taṃ tathaiva ca mānuṣam / dṛṣṭvā tīrṇāmbudhiṃ bhūyastau bhayaṃ hṛdi cakratuḥ //	Remembering how they were defeated by Rāma, and seeing that Lohajaṅgha was also a man who had crossed the sea,[17] they were once more alarmed in their hearts.
saṃmantrya ca tayormadhyādeko gatvā tadaiva tam / vibhīṣaṇāya prabhave yathādṛṣṭaṃ nyavedayat //	So, after they had deliberated together, one of them went off immediately and told the whole occurrence to King Vibhīṣaṇa.
dṛṣṭarāmaprabhāvaḥ sanso 'pi rājā vibhīṣaṇaḥ / mānuṣāgamanādbhīto rākṣasaṃ tamabhāṣata // gaccha madvacanādbhadra prītyā taṃ brūhi mānuṣam / āgamyatāṃ gṛhe 'smākaṃ prasādaḥ kriyatāmiti // tathetyāgatya tattasmai svaprabhuprārthanāvacaḥ / cakito lohajaṅghāya śaśaṃsa sa ca rākṣasaḥ //	King Vibhīṣaṇa, too, as he had seen the prowess of Rāma, being terrified at the arrival of a man, said to that Rākṣasa: “Go, my good friend, and tell that man from me, in a friendly manner, that he is to do me the favour of coming to my palace.” The Rākṣasa said, “I will do so,” and timidly approached Lohajaṅgha, and told him that request of his sovereign’s.
so 'pyaṅgīkṛtya tadvipro lohajaṅghaḥ praśāntadhīḥ / tenaiva sadvitīyena saha laṅkāṃ tato 'gamat //	Lohajaṅgha for his part accepted that invitation with unruffled calm, and went to Laṅkā with that Rākṣasa as his companion.
tasyāṃ ca dṛṣṭasauvarṇatattatprāsādavismitaḥ / praviśya rājabhavanaṃ sa dadarśa vibhīṣaṇam //	And when he arrived in Laṅkā he was astonished at beholding numerous splendid edifices of gold, and entering the king’s palace he saw Vibhīṣaṇa.
so 'pi papraccha rājā taṃ kṛtātithyaḥ kṛtāśiṣam / brahman katham imāṃ bhūmim anuprāpto bhavān iti // tataḥ sa dhūrto 'vādīttaṃ lohajaṅgho vibhīṣaṇam / vipro 'haṃ lohajaṅghākhyo mathurāyāṃ kṛtasthitiḥ //	The king welcomed the Brāhman, who blessed him in return, and then Vibhīṣaṇa said: “Brāhman, how did you manage to reach this country?” Then the cunning Lohajaṅgha said to Vibhīṣaṇa: “I am a Brāhman of the name of Lohajaṅgha residing in Mathurā;
so 'haṃ dāridryasaṃtaptastatra nārāyaṇāmataḥ / nirāhāraḥ sthito 'kārṣaṃ gatvā devakulaṃ tapaḥ // vibhīṣaṇāntikaṃ gaccha madbhakaḥ sa hi te dhanam / dāsyatīty ādiśat svapne tato māṃ bhagavān hariḥ // kvāhaṃ vibhīṣaṇaḥ keti mayokte sa punaḥ prabhuḥ / samādiśadvrajādyaiva taṃ drakṣyasi vibhīṣaṇam //	and I, Lohajaṅgha, being afflicted at my poverty, went to the temple of the god, and remaining fasting, for a long time performed austerities in the presence of Nārāyaṇa.[18] Then the adorable Hari[18] commanded me in a dream, saying: ‘Go thou to Vibhīṣaṇa, for he is a faithful worshipper of mine, and he will give thee wealth.’ Then I said: ‘Vibhīṣaṇa is where I cannot reach him.’ But the lord continued: ‘To-day shalt thou see that Vibhīṣaṇa.’ So the lord spake to me, and immediately I woke up and found myself upon this side of the sea.
ityuktaḥ prabhuṇā sadyaḥ prabuddho 'hamihāmbudheḥ / pāre 'vasthitamātmānamapaśyaṃ vedmi nāparam // ityukto lohajaṅghena laṅkāmālokya durgamām / satyaṃ divyaprabhāvo 'yamiti mene vibhīṣaṇaḥ //	I know no more.” When Vibhīṣaṇa heard this from Lohajaṅgha, reflecting that Laṅkā was a difficult place to reach, he thought to himself: “Of a truth this man possesses divine power.” And he said to that Brāhman: “Remain here;
tiṣṭha dāsyāmi te vittam ity uktvā brāhmaṇaṃ ca tam / matvā ca rakṣasāṃ haste tamapreṣyaṃ nṛghātinām // tatrasthātsvarṇamūlākhyādgireḥ saṃprekṣya rākṣasān / ānāyayat pakṣipotaṃ garuḍānvayasaṃbhavam // taṃ cāsmai lohajaṅghāyā mathurāyāṃ gamiṣyate / tatkālameva pradadau vaśīkārāya vāhanam //	I will give you wealth.” Then he committed him to the care of the man-slaying Rākṣasas as an inviolable deposit, and sent some of his subjects to a mountain in his kingdom called Svarṇamūla, who brought from it a young bird belonging to the race of Garuḍa; and he gave it to that Lohajaṅgha (who had to take a long journey to Mathurā) to ride upon, in order that he might in the meanwhile break it in.
lohajaṅgho 'pi laṅkāyāṃ vāhayannadhiruhya tam / kaṃcitkālaṃ viśaśrāma sa vibhīṣaṇasatkṛtaḥ //	Lohajaṅgha for his part mounted on its back, and riding about on it in Laṅkā, rested there for some time, being hospitably entertained by Vibhīṣaṇa.
ekadā taṃ ca papraccha rākṣasendraṃ sakautukaḥ / laṅkāyāṃ kāṣṭhamayyeṣā kathaṃ sarvaiva bhūriti //	One day he asked the King of the Rākṣasas, feeling curiosity on the point, why the whole ground of Laṅkā was made of wood;
tacchrutvā sa ca tadvṛttaṃ tamuvāca vibhīṣaṇaḥ / yadi te kautukaṃ brahmaṃstadidaṃ śṛṇu vacmi te //	and Vibhīṣaṇa, when he heard that, explained the circumstance to him, saying: “Brāhman, if you take any interest in this matter, listen, I will explain it to you.
purā pratijñopanatāṃ nāgānāṃ dāsabhāvataḥ / niṣkraṣṭukāmo jananīṃ garuḍaḥ kaśyapātmajaḥ // tanmūlyabhūtāṃ devebhyaḥ sudhāmāhartumudyataḥ / balasya hetor bhakṣyārthī svapitur nikaṭaṃ yayau // sa cainaṃ yācito 'vādīnmahāntau gajakacchapau / abdhau staḥ putra tau bhuṅkṣva gaccha śāpacutāviti //	Long ago Garuḍa, the son of Kaśyapa, wishing to redeem his mother from her slavery to the snakes, to whom she had been subjected in accordance with an agreement,[19] and preparing to obtain from the gods the nectar which was the price of her ransom, wanted to eat something which would increase his strength, and so he went to his father, who, being importuned, said to him: ‘My son, in the sea there is a huge elephant and a huge tortoise.
tataḥ sa garuḍo gatvā bhakṣyāvādāya tāvubhau / mahataḥ kalpavṛkṣasya śākhāyāṃ samupāviśat // tāṃ ca śākhāṃ bharāt sadyo bhagnāṃ cañcvā babhāra saḥ / adhaḥ sthitataponiṣṭhavālakhilyānurodhataḥ //	They have assumed their present form in consequence of a curse: go and eat them.’ Then Garuḍa went and brought them both to eat, and then perched on a bough of the great wishing-tree of paradise.[20] And when that bough suddenly broke with his weight, he held it up with his beak, out of regard to the Bālakhilyas[21] who were engaged in austerities underneath it.
lokopamardabhītena tenātha piturājñayā / ānīya vijane tyaktā sā śākheha garutmatā //	Then Garuḍa, afraid that the bough would crush mankind if he let it fall at random, by the advice of his father brought the bough to this uninhabited part of the earth and let it drop.
tasyāḥ pṛṣṭhe kṛtā laṅkā tena kāṭhamayīha bhūḥ / etadvibhiṣaṇācchrutvā lohajaṅghastutoṣa saḥ //	Laṅkā was built on the top of that bough, therefore the ground here is of wood.” When he heard this from Vibhīṣaṇa, Lohajaṅgha was perfectly satisfied.
tatas tasmai mahārghāṇi ratnāni subahūni ca / vibhīṣaṇo dadāti sma mathurāṃ gantumicchate //	Then Vibhīṣaṇa gave to Lohajaṅgha many valuable jewels, as he desired to set out for Mathurā.
bhaktyā ca devasya harer mathurāvartinaḥ kṛte / haste 'syābjagadāśaṅkhacakrān hemamayān dadau //	And out of his devotion to the god Viṣṇu, who dwells at Mathurā, he entrusted to the care of Lohajaṅgha a lotus, a club, a shell and a discus all of gold, to be offered to the god.
tadgṛhītvākhilaṃ tasmin vibhīṣaṇasamarpite / āruhya vihage lakṣaṃ yojanānāṃ prayātari // utpatya vyomamārgeṇa laṅkāyāstīrṇavāridhiḥ / sa lohajaṅgho mathurāmakleśenājagāma tām //	Lohajaṅgha took all these and mounted the bird given to him by Vibhīṣaṇa, that could accomplish a hundred thousand yojanas,[22] and rising up into the air in Laṅkā, he crossed the sea and without any difficulty arrived at Mathurā.
tasyāṃ śūnye vihāre ca bāhye vyomno 'vatīrya saḥ / sthāpayāmāsa ratnaughaṃ taṃ babandha ca pakṣiṇam //	And there he descended from the air into an empty convent outside the town, and deposited there his abundant treasure, and tied up that bird.
āpaṇe ratnam ekaṃ ca gatvā vikrītavāṃs tataḥ / atha vastrāṅgarāgādi krītavān bhojanaṃ tathā //	And then he went into the market and sold one of his jewels, and bought garments and scented unguents, and also food.
tadvihāre ca tatraiva bhuktvā dattvā ca pakṣiṇe / vastrāṅgarāgapuṣpādyairātmānaṃ tairabhūṣayat //	And he ate the food in that convent where he was, and gave some to his bird; and he adorned himself with the garments, unguents, flowers and other decorations.

taṃ ca śrutvaiva niryātā sāpaśyadratnarājitam / enaṃ nārāyaṇākalpaṃ vyomni rūpaṇikā niśi //	But Rūpiṇikā, as soon as she heard that sound, came out, and saw hovering in the air by night a being like Nārāyaṇa, gleaming with jewels.
ahaṃ haririhāyātastvadarthamiti tena sā / uktā praṇamya vakti sma dayāṃ devaḥ karotviti // athāvatīryā saṃyamya lohajaṅgho vihaṃgamam / viveśa vāsabhavanaṃ sa tayā kānayā saha //	He said to her: “I am Hari come hither for thy sake”; whereupon she bowed with her face to the earth and said: “May the god have mercy upon me!” Then Lohajaṅgha descended and tied up his bird, and entered the private apartments of his beloved hand in hand with her.
tatra saṃprāptasaṃbhogaḥ sa niṣkramya kṣaṇāntare / tathaiva vihagārūḍho jagāma nabhasā tataḥ // devatā viṣubhāryāhaṃ martyaiḥ saha na mantraye / iti rūpaṇikā prātas tasthau maunaṃ vidhāya sā // kasmādevaṃvidhaṃ putri vartase kathyatāṃ tvayā / ityapṛcchata sā mātrā tato makaradaṃṣṭrayā //	And after remaining there a short time he came out and, mounting the bird as before, went off through the air.[23] In the morning Rūpiṇikā remained observing an obstinate silence, thinking to herself: “I am the wife of the god Viṣṇu, I must cease to converse with mortals.” And then her mother Makaradaṃṣṭrā said to her: “Why do you behave in this way, my daughter?” And after she had been perseveringly questioned by her mother, she caused to be put up a curtain between herself and her parent, and told her what had taken place in the night, which was the cause of her silence.
nirbandhapṛṣṭā tasyai ca sā mātre maunakāraṇam / śaśaṃsa rātrivṛttāntaṃ dāpayitvāntare paṭam // sā tacchrutvā sasaṃdehā svayaṃ taṃ kuṭṭanī niśi / dadarśa vihagārūḍhaṃ lohajaṅghaṃ tataḥ kṣaṇam // prabhāte ca paṭāntaḥsthāmetya rūpaṇikāṃ rahaḥ / prahvā makaradaṃṣṭrā sā kuṭṭanīti vyajijñapat // devasyānugrahātputri tvaṃ devītvamihāgatā / ahaṃ ca te 'tra jananī tanme dehi sutāphalam //	When the bawd heard that, she felt doubt on the subject, but soon after, at night, she saw that very Lohajaṅgha mounted on the bird, and in the morning Makaradaṃṣṭrā came secretly to Rūpiṇikā, who still remained behind the curtain, and inclining herself humbly, preferred to her this request: “Through the favour of the god, thou, my daughter, hast obtained here on earth the rank of a goddess, and I am thy mother in this world, therefore grant me a reward for giving thee birth: entreat the god that, old as I am, with this very body I may enter paradise.
tatheti sā rūpaṇikā tamevārthaṃ vyajijñapat / vyājaviṣṇuṃ punarnaktaṃ lohajaṅgahmupāgatam //	Do me this favour.” Rūpiṇikā consented, and requested that very boon from Lohajaṅgha, who came again at night disguised as Viṣṇu.
tataḥ sa devaveṣas tāṃ lohajaṅgho 'bravītpriyām / pāpā te jananī svargaṃ vyaktaṃ netuṃ na yujyate //	Then Lohajaṅgha, who was personating the god, said to that beloved of his: “Thy mother is a wicked woman, it would not be fitting to take her openly to paradise;
ekādaśyāṃ punaḥ prātardvāramudghaṭyate divi / tatra ca praviśantyagre bahavaḥ śāṃbhavā gaṇāḥ //	but on the morning of the eleventh day the door of heaven is opened, and many of the Gaṇas, Śiva’s companions, enter into it before anyone else is admitted.
tanmadhye kṛtatadveṣā tvanmātāsau praveśyate / tadasyāḥ pañcacūḍaṃ tvaṃ kṣurakḷptaṃ śiraḥ kuru // kaṇṭhaṃ karaṅkamālāḍhyaṃ pārśvaṃ caikaṃ sakajjalam / anyatsindūraliptaṃ ca kurvasyā vītavāsasaḥ // evaṃ hyenāṃ gaṇākārāṃ sukhaṃ svargaṃ nayāmyaham / ityuktvā sa kṣaṇaṃ sthitvā lohajaṅghastato 'gamat //	Among them I will introduce this mother of thine, if she assume their appearance. So shave her head with a razor, in such a manner that five locks[24] shall be left, put a necklace of skulls round her neck, and stripping off her clothes, paint one side of her body with lamp-black and the other with red lead,[25] for when she has in this way been made to resemble a Gaṇa, I shall find it an easy matter to get her into heaven.” When he had said this, Lohajaṅgha remained a short time and then departed.
prātaśca sā rūpaṇikā yathoktaṃ tamakārayat / veṣaṃ māturathaipāpi tasthau svargaikasaṃmukhī //	And in the morning Rūpiṇikā attired her mother as he had directed; and then she remained with her mind entirely fixed on paradise.
āyayau ca punastatra lohajaṅgho niśāmukhe / sā ca rūpaṇikā tasmai mātaraṃ tāṃ samarpayat //	So when night came Lohajaṅgha appeared again, and Rūpiṇikā handed over her mother to him.
tataḥ sa vihagārūḍhastāmādāyaiva kuṭṭanīm / agnāṃ vikṛtaveṣāṃ ca javādudapatannabhaḥ //	Then he mounted on the bird, and took the bawd with him naked, and transformed as he had directed, and he flew up rapidly with her into the air.
gaganasthaśca tatraiva prāṃśuṃ devakulāgrataḥ / sa dadarśa śilāstambhaṃ cakreṇopari lāñchitam //	While he was in the air, he beheld a lofty stone pillar in front of a temple, with a discus on its summit.
tasya pṛṣṭhe sa cakraikasālambe tāṃ nyaveśayat / khalikārapratīkārapatākāmiva kuṭṭanīm //	So he placed her on the top of the pillar, with the discus as her only support,[26] and there she hung like a banner to blazon forth his revenge for his ill usage.
iha tiṣṭha kṣaṇaṃ yāvatsāṃnidhyānugrahaṃ bhuvi / gatvā karomīty uktvā ca tasyā dṛṣṭipathād yayau //	He said to her: “Remain here a moment while I bless the earth with my approach,” and vanished from her sight.

so 'pi vyomno 'vatīryaiva lohajaṅgho 'valokayan / tasthāv adṛṣṭas tanmadhye devaveṣaṃ nivārya tam //	Lohajaṅgha for his part descended from the air and encouraged them to pray, and after changing that dress of his came and stood among the people, without being observed.
adyāpi nāgato devo na ca svargamahaṃ gatā / iti ca stambhapṛṣṭhasthā kuṭṭanyevamacintayat // akṣamaivopari sthātuṃ śrāvayantī janānadhaḥ / hā hāhaṃ patitāsmīti sā cakranda ca vibhyatī // tacchrutvā patitā seyaṃ mārītyāśaṅkya cākulāḥ / devi mā mā patetyūcaste devāgragatā janāḥ // tataḥ sabālavṛddhāste māthurāstāṃ vibhāvarīm / mārīpātabhayodbhrāntā kathamapyatyavāhayan //	The bawd thought as she sat upon the top of the pillar: “The god has not come as yet, and I have not reached heaven.” At last, feeling it impossible to remain up there any longer, she cried out in her fear, so that the people below heard: “Alas! I am falling, I am falling.” Hearing that, the people in front of the god’s temple were beside themselves, fearing that the destroying goddess was falling upon them, even as had been foretold, and said: “O goddess, do not fall, do not fall.” So those people of Mathurā, young and old, spent that night in perpetual dread that the destroying goddess would fall upon them, but at last it came to an end;
prātaśca dṛṣṭvā stambhasthāṃ kuṭṭanīṃ tāṃ tathāvidhām / pratyabhijñātavānsarvaḥ pauralokaḥ sarājakaḥ //	and then beholding that bawd upon the pillar in the state described,[27] the citizens and the king recognised her at once.
sā ca dṛṣṭvā savailaṣyā stambhāgrājjananīṃ nijām / tāmavātārayatsadyastatrasthaiśca janaiḥ saha //	And when she saw it she was abashed, and with the help of the people who were there she managed to get that mother of hers down from the top of the pillar immediately.
tataḥ sā kuṭṭanī tatra sarvaistaiḥ sakutūhalaiḥ / apṛcchyata yathāvṛttaṃ sāpi tebhyaḥ śaśaṃsa tat //	Then that bawd was asked by all the people there, who were filled with curiosity, to tell them the whole story, and she did so.
tataḥ siddhādicaritaṃ tanmatvādbhutakārakam / sarājavipravaṇijo janās te vākyam abruvan // yeneyaṃ vipralabdhā hi vañcitānekakāmukā / prakaṭaḥ so 'stu tasyeha paṭṭabandho vidhīyate //	Thereupon the king, the Brāhmans and the merchants, thinking that that laughable incident must have been brought about by a sorcerer or some person of that description, made a proclamation, that whoever had made a fool of the bawd, who had deceived innumerable lovers, was to show himself, and he would receive a turban of honour on the spot.
tacchrutvā lohajaṅghaḥ sa tatrātmānamadarśayat / pṛṣṭaścāmūlataḥ sarvaṃ vṛttāntaṃ tamavarṇayat //	When he heard that, Lohajaṅgha made himself known to those present, and, being questioned, he related the whole story from its commencement.
dadau ca tatra devāya śaṅkhacakrādyupāyanam / vibhīṣaṇena prahitaṃ janavismayakārakam //	And he offered to the god the discus, shell, club and lotus of gold, the present which Vibhīṣaṇa had sent, and which aroused the astonishment of the people.
atha tasya sapadi paṭṭaṃ baddhvā saṃtuṣya māthurāḥ sarve / svādhīnāṃ rūpaṇikāṃ rājādeśena tāṃ cakruḥ //	Then all the people of Mathurā, being pleased, immediately invested him with a turban of honour, and by the command of the king made that Rūpiṇikā a free woman.
tataś ca tatra priyayā samaṃ tadā samṛddhakoṣo bahuratnasaṃcayaiḥ / sa lohajaṅghaḥ pratikṛtya kuṭṭanī nikāramanyuṃ nyavasadyathāsukham //	And then Lohajaṅgha, having wreaked upon the bawd his wrath caused by her ill usage of him, lived in great comfort in Mathurā with that beloved of his, being very well off by means of the large stock of jewels which he had brought from Laṅkā.

[M] (Main story line continued) AS time went on Vāsavadattā began to feel a great affection for the King of Vatsa, and to take part with him against her father.
tato vatseśanikaṭaṃ punar yaugandharāyaṇaḥ / viveśādarśanaṃ kṛtvā sarvān anyāñ janān prati //	Then Yaugandharāyaṇa again came in to see the King of Vatsa, making himself invisible to all the others who were there.
vasantakasamakṣaṃ ca vijane taṃ vyajijñapat / rājan baddho bhavāṃś caṇḍamahāsenena māyayā //	And he gave him the following information in private in the presence of Vasantaka only: “King, you were made captive by King Caṇḍamahāsena by means of an artifice.
sutāṃ ca dattvā saṃmānya tvāmayaṃ moktumicchati / tadasyaināṃ svayaṃ hṛtvā gacchāmastanayāṃ vayam //	And he wishes to give you his daughter, and set you at liberty, treating you with all honour; so let us carry off his daughter and escape.

asti caitena dattāsyās tanayāyāḥ kareṇukā / rājñā vāsavadattāyā nāmnā bhadravatī nṛpa //	Now the king has given that daughter of his, Vāsavadattā, a female elephant called Bhadravatī.
sā cānugantuṃ vegena śaktyā nānyena dantinā / muktvā naḍāgiriṃ so 'pi tāṃ dṛṣṭaiva na yudhyate //	And no other elephant but Naḍāgiri is swift enough to catch her up, and he will not fight when he sees her.

tadāruhya kareṇuṃ tāṃ saha vāsavadattayā / sāyudhenāpayātavyaṃ naktaṃ guptamitastvayā //	So you must mount that elephant with Vāsavadattā, fully armed, and start from this place secretly by night.
ihatyaśca mahāmātro dviradeṅgitavittadā / madyena kṣībatāṃ neyo naitaccetayate yathā //	And you must have the superintendent of the royal elephants here made drunk with wine, in order that he may not perceive what is about to take place,[1] for he understands every sign that elephants give.
pulindakasya sakhyuste pārśvamagre ca yāmyaham / mārgarakṣārthamityuktvā yayau yaugandharāyaṇaḥ //	I for my part will first repair to your ally Pulindaka in order that he may be prepared to guard the road by which you escape.” When he had said this, Yaugandharāyaṇa departed.
vatsarājo 'pi tatsarvaṃ kartavyaṃ hṛdaye vyadhāt / atha vāsavadattā sā tasyāntikamupāyayau //	So the King of Vatsa stored up all his instructions in his heart; and soon Vāsavadattā came to him.
tatastāstāḥ savisrambhāḥ kathāḥ kurvaṃstayā saha / yaugandharāyaṇoktaṃ ca tasyai rājā śaśaṃsa saḥ //	Then he made all kinds of confidential speeches to her, and at last told her what Yaugandharāyaṇa had said to him.

tataḥ pradoṣe vilasanmeghaśabdasamākule / āṣāḍhakaḥ kareṇuṃ tāṃ sajjīkṛtyānināya saḥ // sajjyamānā ca sā śabdaṃ cakāra kariṇī kila / taṃ ca hastirutābhijño mahāmātro 'tha so 'śṛṇot //	Then in the evening, which was disturbed with the echoing roar of clouds,[2] Āṣāḍhaka brought that female elephant ready harnessed, but she, while she was being harnessed, uttered a cry, which was heard by the superintendent of the elephants, who was skilled in elephant’s language;
triṣaṣṭiyojanānyadya yāsyāmītyāha hastinī / ityuvāca sa coddāmamadaviskhalitākṣaram // vicārārhaṃ punastasya mattasyābhūnna mānasam / tacca hastipakāḥ kṣībāstadvākyaṃ naiva śuśruvuḥ //	and he faltered out in a voice indistinct from excessive intoxication: “The female elephant says she is going sixty-three yojanas to-day.” But his mind in his drunken state was not capable of reasoning, and the elephant-drivers, who were also intoxicated, did not even hear what he said.
tataśca vatsarājo 'tra vīṇāmādāya tāṃ nijām / yaugandharāyaṇātprāptairyogaiḥ sraṃsitabandhanaḥ // upanītapraharaṇaḥ svairaṃ vāsavadattayā / kareṇukāyām ārohat sa tasyāṃ savasantakaḥ //	Then the King of Vatsa broke his chains by means of the charms which Yaugandharāyaṇa had given him, and took that lute of his, and Vāsavadattā of her own accord brought him his weapons, and then he mounted the female elephant with Vasantaka.
tato vāsavadattāpi saha kāñcanamālayā / sakhyā rahasyadhāriṇyā tasyāmevāruroha sā //	And then Vāsavadattā mounted the same elephant with her friend and confidante Kāñcanamālā;
athojjayinyā niragātsa hastipakapañcamaḥ / vatseśo niśi mattebhabhinnaprākāravartmanā //	then the King of Vatsa went out from Ujjayinī with five persons in all, including himself and the elephant-driver, by a path which the infuriated elephant clove through the rampart.
tatsthānarakṣiṇau vīrau svairaṃ sa hatavānnṛpaḥ / vīrabāhuṃ tathā tālabhaṭaṃ rājasutāvubhau //	And the king attacked and slew the two warriors who guarded that point, the Rājpūts Vīrabāhu and Tālabhaṭa.
tataḥ pratasthe vegena sa rājā dayitāsakhaḥ / hṛṣṭaḥ kareṇukārūḍho dadhatyāṣāḍhake 'ṅkuśam //	Then the monarch set out rapidly on his journey in high spirits, mounted on the female elephant, together with his beloved, Āṣāḍhaka holding the elephant-hook.
ujjayinyāṃ ca tau dṛṣṭvā hatau prākārarakṣiṇau / rājñe nyavedayanrātrau kṣubhitāḥ purarakṣiṇaḥ //	In the meanwhile in Ujjayinī the city patrol beheld those guards of the rampart lying dead, and in consternation reported the news to the king at night.
so 'pyanviṣya kramāccaṇḍamahāsenaḥ palāyitam / hṛtavāsavadattaṃ taṃ vatsarājamabudhyata //	Caṇḍamahāsena inquired into the matter, and found out at last that the King of Vatsa had escaped, taking Vāsavadattā with him.
tatputraḥ pālakākhyo 'tha jātakolāhale pure / anvadhāvatsa vatseśamadhiruhya naḍāgirim //	Then the alarm spread through the city, and one of his sons named Pālaka mounted Naḍāgiri and pursued the King of Vatsa.
vatseśo 'pi tamāyāntaṃ pahi bāṇairayodhayat / naḍāgiriḥ kareṇuṃ tāṃ dṛṣṭvā na prajahāra ca //	The King of Vatsa for his part combated him with arrows as he advanced, and Naḍāgiri, seeing that female elephant, would not attack her.
tataḥ sa pālako bhrātrā paścādetya nyavartyata / gopālakena vākyajñaḥ pitṛkāryānurodhinā //	Then Pālaka, who was ready to listen to reason, was induced to desist from the pursuit by his brother Gopālaka, who had his father’s interests at heart.
vatsarājo 'pi visrabdhaṃ gantuṃ pravavṛte tataḥ / gacchataścātra śanakaiḥ śarvarī paryahīyata // tato vindhyāṭavīṃ prāpya madhyāhne tasya bhūpateḥ / triṣaṣṭiyojanāyātā tṛṣitābhūtkareṇukā //	Then the King of Vatsa boldly continued his journey, and as he journeyed the night gradually came to an end. So by the middle of the day the king had reached the Vindhya forest, and his elephant, having journeyed sixty-three yojanas, was thirsty.
avatīrṇe sabhārye ca rājñi tasmiñjalāni sā / pītvā taddoṣataḥ prāpa pañcatāṃ hastinī kṣaṇāt //	So the king and his wife dismounted, and the female elephant having drunk water, owing to its being bad, fell dead on the spot.
viṣaṇṇo 'tha sa vatseśaḥ saha vāsavadattayā / gaganādudgatāmetāṃ śṛṇoti sma sarasvatīm // ahaṃ māyāvatī nāma rājanvidyādharāṅganā / iyantaṃ kālamabhavaṃ śāpadoṣeṇa hastinī //	Then the King of Vatsa and Vāsavadattā, in their despair, heard this voice coming from the air: “I, O king, am a female Vidyādhara named Māyāvatī, and for this long time I have been a female elephant in consequence of a curse;
upakāraṃ ca vatseśa tavādya ṛtavatyaham / kariṣyāmi ca bhūyo 'pi tvatputrasya bhaviṣyataḥ // eṣā vāsavadattā ca patnī te naiva mānuṣī / devīyaṃ kāraṇavaśādavatīrṇā kṣitāviti //	and to-day, O lord of Vatsa, I have done you a good turn, and I will do another to your son that is to be: and this queen of yours, Vāsavadattā, is not a mere mortal;
tataḥ sa hṛṣṭo vyasṛjadvindhyasānuṃ vasantakam / pulindakāya suhṛde vaktuṃ svāgamanaṃ nṛpaḥ // svayaṃ ca pādacārī sansa śanairdayitānvitaḥ / tatraiva gacchann utthāya dasyubhiḥ paryavāryata //	she is a goddess for a certain cause incarnate on the earth.” Then the king regained his spirits, and sent on Vasantaka to the plateau of the Vindhya hills to announce his arrival to his ally Pulindaka; and as he was himself journeying along slowly on foot with his beloved he was surrounded by brigands, who sprang out from an ambuscade.
dhanurdvitīyo dasyūnāṃ teṣāṃ pañcottaraṃ śatam / puro vāsavadattāyā vatsarājaḥ sa cāvadhīt //	And the king, with only his bow to help him, slew one hundred and five of them before the eyes of Vāsavadattā.
tatkṣaṇaṃ so 'sya rājño 'tra mittraṃ cāgātpulindakaḥ / yaugandharāyaṇasakho vasantakapuraḥsaraḥ //	And immediately the king’s ally Pulindaka came up, together with Yaugandharāyaṇa, Vasantaka showing them the way.
sa tāndasyūnnivāryānyānvatseśaṃ praṇipatya tam / nayati sma nijāṃ pallīṃ bhillarājaḥ savallabham //	The King of the Bheels ordered the surviving brigands[3] to desist, and after prostrating himself before the King of Vatsa, conducted him with his beloved to his own village.
tatra tāṃ rātrimāraṇyadarbhapāṭitapādayā / sa vatseśo viśaśrāsa saha vāsavadattayā // prātaḥ senāpatiś cāsya rumaṇvān prāpadantikam / yaugandharāyaṇena prāgdūtaṃ saṃpreṣya bodhitaḥ //	The king rested there that night with Vāsavadattā, whose foot had been cut with a blade of forest grass, and early in the morning the General Rumaṇvat reached him, who had before been summoned by Yaugandharāyaṇa, who sent a messenger to him.
agācca kaṭakaṃ sarvaṃ tathā vyāptadigantaram / yathā vindhyāṭavī prāpa sā saṃbādharasajñatām //	And the whole army came with him, filling the land as far as the eye could reach, so that the Vindhya forest appeared to be besieged.
praviśya kaṭake tasmiṃstasyāmevāṭavībhuvi / tasthāvujjayinīvārtāṃ jñātuṃ vatseśvaro 'tha saḥ //	So that King of Vatsa entered into the encampment of his army, and remained in that wild region to wait for news from Ujjayinī.
tatrasthaṃ ca tamabhyāgādujjayinyā vaṇiktadā / yaugandharāyaṇasuhṛtsa cāgatyābravīdidam // deva caṇḍamahāsenaḥ prīto jāmātari tvayi / preṣitaśca pratīhārasteneha bhavadantikam //	And while he was there a merchant came from Ujjayinī, a friend of Yaugandharāyaṇa’s, and when he had arrived reported these tidings: “The King Caṇḍamahāsena is pleased to have thee for a son-in-law, and he has sent his warder to thee.
sa cāgacchansthitaḥ paścādahamagrata eva tu / pracchannaḥ satvaraṃ devaṃ vijñāpayitumāgataḥ // etacchrutvā sa vatseśo jaharṣa ca śaśaṃsa ca / sarvaṃ vāsavadattāyāḥ sāpi harṣamagātparam //	however, I came secretly on in front of him, as fast as I could, to bring your Highness information.” When he heard this the King of Vatsa rejoiced, and told it all to Vāsavadattā, and she was exceedingly delighted.
kṛtabandhuparityāgā vivāhavidhisatvarā / atha vāsavadattā sā salajjā cotsukā tathā // tataḥ svātmavinodāya nikaṭasthaṃ vasantakam / sā jagāda kathā kācittvayā me varṇyatāmiti // sa ca mugdhadṛśastasyā bhartṛbhaktivivardhinīm / vasantakastadā dhīmānimāmakathayatkathām //	Then Vāsavadattā, having abandoned her own relations, and being anxious for the ceremony of marriage, was at the same time bashful and impatient: then she said, in order to divert her thoughts, to Vasantaka, who was in attendance: “Tell me some story.” Then the sagacious Vasantaka told that fair-eyed one the following tale in order to increase her affection for her husband.
astīha nagarī loke tāmraliptīti viśrutā / tasyāṃ ca dhanadattākhyo vaṇigāsīnmadhādhanaḥ //	There is a city in the world famous under the name of Tāmraliptā, and in that city there was a very rich merchant named Dhanadatta.
sa cāputro bahūnviprānsaṃghaṭya praṇato 'bravīt / tathā kuruta putro me yathā syādacirāditi // tatas tam ūcur viprāste naitat kiṃcana duṣkaram / sarvaṃ hi sādhayantīha dvijāḥ śrautena karmaṇā //	And he, being childless, assembled many Brāhmans and said to them with due respect: “Take such steps as will procure me a son soon.” Then those Brāhmans said to him: “This is not at all difficult, for Brāhmans can accomplish all things in this world by means of ceremonies in accordance with the scriptures.
tathā ca pūrvamabhavadrāja kaścidaputrakaḥ / pañcottaraṃ śataṃ cābhūttasyāntaḥpurayoṣitām //	To give you an instance, there was in old time a king who had no sons, and he had a hundred and five wives in his harem.
putrīyeṣṭyā ca tasyaiko janturnāma suto 'jani / tatpatnīnāmaśeṣāṇāṃ nūtanendūdayo dṛśi // jānubhyāṃ paryaṭantaṃ ca bālaṃ jātu pipīlikā / urūdeśe dadaṃśainaṃ muktacūtkārakātaram //	And by means of a sacrifice to procure a son there was born to him a son named Jantu, who was like the rising of the new moon to the eyes of his wives. Once on a time an ant bit the boy on the thigh as he was crawling about on his knees, so that he was very un-happy and sobbed loudly.
tāvatā tumulākrandamantaḥ puramajāyata / rājāpi putra putreti cikranda prākṛto yathā //	Thereupon the whole harem was full of confused lamentation, and the king himself shrieked out, ‘My son! my son!’ like a common man.
kṣaṇāttasminsamāśvaste bāle 'pāstapipīlike / duḥkhaikakāraṇaṃ rājā sa ninindaikaputratām //	The boy was soon comforted, the ant having been removed, and the king blamed the misfortune of his only having one son as the cause of all his grief.
asti kaścidupāyo me yena syurbahavaḥ sutāḥ / iti tatparitāpena papraccha brāhmaṇāṃśca saḥ //	And he asked the Brāhmans in his affliction if there was any expedient by which he might obtain a large number of children.
te taṃ pratyabruvanrājannupāyo 'tra tavāstyayam / havaitaṃ tvatsutaṃ vahnau tanmāsaṃ hūyate 'khilam // tadgandhāghrāṇato rājñyaḥ sarvāḥ prāpsyanti te sutān / etac chrutvā sa rājā tat tathā sarvam akārayat //	They answered him: ‘O king, there is one expedient open to you: you must slay this son and offer up all his flesh in the fire.[4] By smelling the smell of that sacrifice all thy wives will obtain sons.’ When he heard that, the king had the whole ceremony performed as they directed;
svapatnīsamasaṃkhyāṃś ca sa putrān prāptavān nṛpaḥ / atas tavāpi homena sādhayāmo vayaṃ sutam // ityuktvā dhanadattaṃ te brāhmaṇāḥ kḷptadakṣiṇam / homaṃ cakrustatastasya vaṇijo jātavānsutaḥ //	So we can obtain a son for you also by a burnt-offering.” When they had said this to Dhanadatta, the Brāhmans, after a sacrificial fee had been promised them, performed a sacrifice: then a son was born to that merchant. That son was called Guhasena, and he gradually grew up to man’s estate.
guhasenābhidhānaśca sa balo vavṛdhe kramāt / pitātha dhanadatto 'sya bhāryāmanviṣyati sma saḥ // tataḥ sa tatpitā tena tanayena samaṃ yayau / dvīpāntaraṃ snuṣāhetorvaṇijyāvyapadeśataḥ //	Then his father Dhanadatta began to look out for a wife for him. Then his father went with that son of his to another country, on the pretence of traffic, but really to get a daughter-in-law;
tatra devasmitāṃ nāma dharmaguptādvaṇigvarāt / svaputraguhasenasya kṛte kanyāmayācata //	there he asked an excellent merchant of the name of Dharmagupta to give him his daughter named Devasmitā for his son Guhasena.
dharmaguptastu saṃbandhaṃ na tamaṅgīcakāra saḥ / ālocya tāmraliptīṃ tāṃ durāṃ duhitṛvatsalaḥ //	But Dharmagupta, who was tenderly attached to his daughter, did not approve of that connection, reflecting that the city of Tāmraliptā was very far off.
sā tu devasmitā dṛṣṭvā guhasenaṃ tadaiva tam / tadguṇākṛṣṭacittatvādbandhutyāgaikaniścayā // sakhīmukhena kṛtvā ca saṃketaṃ saha tena sā / priyeṇa pitṛyuktena rātrau dvīpāttato yayau //	But when Devasmitā beheld that Guhasena, her mind was immediately attracted by his virtues, and she was set on abandoning her relations, and so she made an assignation with him by means of a confidante, and went away from that country at night with her beloved and his father.
tāmraliptīmatha prāpya tayoḥ kṛtavivāhayoḥ / jāyāpatyormithaḥ premapāśabaddhamabhūnmanaḥ //	When they reached Tāmraliptā they were married, and the minds of the young couple were firmly knit together by the bond of mutual love.
athāstaṃ pitari prāpte prerito 'bhūtsa bandhubhiḥ / kaṭāhadvīpagamane guhaseno yadṛcchayā //	Then Guhasena’s father died, and he himself was urged by his relations to go to the country of Kaṭāha [see notes on the identification of Kaṭāha] for the purpose of trafficking;
taccāsya gamanaṃ bhāryā tadā nāṅgīcakāra sā / serṣyā devasmitā kāmamanyastrīsaṅgaśaṅkinī //	but his wife Devasmitā was too jealous to approve of that expedition, fearing exceedingly that he would be attracted by some other lady.
tataḥ patnyāmanicchantyāṃ prerayatsu ca bandhuṣu / kartavyaniścalo mūḍho guhaseno babhūva saḥ //	Then, as his wife did not approve of it, and his relations kept inciting him to it, Guhasena, whose mind was firmly set on doing his duty, was bewildered.
aha gatvā nirāhāraścakre devakule vratam / upāyamiha devo me nirdiśatviti cintayan // sāpi devasmitā tadvattena sārdhaṃ vyadhādvratam / tato 'nayoḥ śivaḥ svapne daṃpatyordarśanaṃ dadau //	Then he went and performed a vow in the temple of the god, observing a rigid fast, trusting that the god would show him some way out of his difficulty. And his wife Devasmitā also performed a vow with him. Then Śiva was pleased to appear to that couple in a dream;
dve ca raktāmbuje dattvā sa devastāvabhāṣata / haste gṛhṇītamekaikaṃ padmametadubhāvapi //	and giving them two red lotuses, the god said to them: “Take each of you one of these lotuses in your hand.
dūrasthatve ca yadyekaḥ śīlatyāgaṃ kariṣyati / tadanyasya kare padmaṃ mlānimeṣyati nānyathā // etacchrutvā prabudhyaiva daṃpatī tāvapaśyatām / anyonyasyeva hṛdayaṃ hastasthaṃ raktamambujam //	And if either of you shall be unfaithful during your separation the lotus in the hand of the other shall fade, but not otherwise.”[5] After hearing this the two woke up, and each beheld in the hand of the other a red lotus, and it seemed as if they had got one another’s hearts.
tataḥ sa cakre prasthānaṃ guhaseno dhṛtāmbujaḥ / sā tu devasmitātatra tasthau padmārpitekṣaṇā //	Then Guhasena set out, lotus in hand, but Devasmitā remained in the house with her eyes fixed upon her flower.
guhaseno 'pi taṃ prāpa kaṭāhadvīpamāśu saḥ / kartuṃ pravavṛte cātra ratnānāṃ krayavikrayau //	Guhasena for his part quickly reached the country of Kaṭāha, and began to buy and sell jewels there.
haste ca tasya taddṛṣṭvā sadaivāmlānamambujam / atra kecidvaṇikputrāścatvāro vismayaṃ yayuḥ //	And four young merchants in that country, seeing that that unfading lotus was ever in his hand, were greatly astonished.
te yuktyā taṃ gṛhaṃ nītvā pāyayitvā bhṛśaṃ madhu / papracchuḥ padmavṛttāntaṃ so 'pi kṣībaḥ śaśaṃsa tam //	Accordingly they got him to their house by an artifice, and made him drink a great deal of wine, and then asked him the history of the lotus, and he being intoxicated told them the whole story.
tatastaṃ ciranirvāhyaratnādikrayavikrayam / vicintya guhasenaṃ te catvāro 'pi vaṇiksutāḥ // saṃmantrya kautukātpāpāstadbhāryāśīlaviplavam / cikīrṣavo yayuḥ śīghraṃ tāmraliptīmalakṣitāḥ //	Then those four young merchants, knowing that Guhasena would take a long time to complete his sales and purchases of jewels and other wares, planned together, like rascals as they were, the seduction of his wife out of curiosity, and eager to accomplish it, set out quickly for Tāmraliptā without their departure being noticed.
tatropāyaṃ vicinvantaḥ sugatāyatanasthitām / pravrājikāmupājagmurnāmnā yogakaraṇḍikām //	There they cast about for some instrument, and at last had recourse to a female ascetic of the name of Yogakaraṇḍikā, who lived in a sanctuary of Buddha;
prītipūrvaṃ ca tām ūcur bhagavaty asmadīpsitam / sādhyate cet tvayā tat te dāsyāmo 'rthān bahūn iti // sāpyuvāca dhruvaṃ yūnāṃ kāpi strī vāñchiteha vaḥ / tadbhūta sādhayāmyeva dhanalipsā ca nāsti me //	and they said to her in an affectionate manner: “Reverend madam, if our object is accomplished by your help we will give you much wealth.” She answered them: “No doubt you young men desire some woman in this city, so tell me all about it, I will procure you the object of your desire; but I have no wish for money.
asti siddhikarī nāma śiṣyā me buddhiśālinī / atprasādena saṃprāptamasaṃkhyaṃ hi dhanaṃ mayā //	I have a pupil of distinguished ability named Siddhikarī;
kathaṃ śiṣyāprasādena bhūri prāptaṃ dhanaṃ tvayā / iti taiḥ sā vaṇikputraiḥ pṛṣṭā pravrājikābravīt // kautukaṃ yadi tatputrāḥ śrūyatāṃ varṇayāmi vaḥ / iha ko'pi vaṇikpūrvamāyayāvuttarāpathāt //	owing to her kindness I have obtained untold wealth.” The young merchants asked: “How have you obtained untold wealth by the assistance of a pupil?” Being asked this question, the female ascetic said: “If you feel any curiosity about the matter, listen, my sons, I will tell you the whole story: Long ago a certain merchant came here from the north;
tasyehasthasya macchiṣyā sā gatvā śiśriye gṛhe / yuktyā karmakarībhāvaṃ kṛtarūpavivartanā //	while he was dwelling here my pupil went and obtained, with a treacherous object, the position of a serving-maid in his house, having first altered her appearance;
viśvāsya vaṇijaṃ taṃ ca tadgṛhātsvarṇasaṃcayam / sarvaṃ muṣitvā pracchannaṃ pratyūṣe sātha niryayau //	and after she had gained the confidence of that merchant she stole all his hoard of gold from his house and went off secretly in the morning twilight.
nagarīnirgatāṃ dṛṣṭvā śaṅkāśīghragatiṃ ca tām / mṛdaṅgahasto moṣāya ḍombaḥ ko 'pyanvagāddrutam //	And as she went out from the city, moving rapidly through fear, a certain Ḍomba,[6] with his drum in his hand, saw her, and pursued her at full speed with the intention of robbing her.
nyagrodhasya talaṃ prāpya sā dṛṣṭvā tamupāgatam / ḍombaṃ siddhikarī dhūrtā sadainyevedamabravīt // bhartrā sahādya kalahaṃ kṛtvāhaṃ nigatā gṛhāt / martuṃ tadbhadra pāśo 'tra tvayā me badhyatāmiti //	When she had reached the foot of a Nyagrodha tree she saw that he had come up with her, and so the cunning Siddhikarī said this to him in a plaintive manner: “I have had a jealous quarrel with my husband, and I have left his house to die, therefore, my good man, make a noose for me to hang myself with.” Then the Ḍomba thought: “Let her hang herself.
pāśena mriyatāmeṣā kimenāṃ hanmyahaṃ striyam / matveti tatra vṛkṣe 'sau ḍombaḥ pāśamasajjayat //	Why should I be guilty of her death, especially as she is a woman?” and so he fastened a noose for her to the tree.
tataḥ siddhikarī ḍombaṃ sā mugdheva jagāda tam / kriyate kathamudbandhastvayā medarśyatāmiti // tataḥ sa ḍombas taṃ dattvā mṛdaṅgaṃ pādayoradhaḥ / itthaṃ kriyata ityuktvā svakaṇṭhe pāśamarpayat //	Then Siddhikarī, feigning ignorance, said to the Ḍomba: “How is the noose slipped round the neck? Show me, I entreat you.” Then the Ḍomba placed the drum under his feet, and saying, “This is the way we do the trick,” he fastened the noose round his own throat.
sāpi siddhikarī sadyastaṃ mṛdaṅgamacūrṇayat / pādāghātena ḍombo 'tha so 'pi pāśe vyapadyata // tatkālamāgato 'nveṣṭuṃ vṛkṣamūle dadarśa saḥ / muṣitāśeṣakoṣāṃ tāṃ dūrātsiddhikarīṃ vaṇik //	Siddhikarī for her part smashed the drum to atoms with a kick, and that Ḍomba hung till he was dead.[7] At that moment the merchant arrived in search of her, and beheld from a distance Siddhikarī, who had stolen from him untold treasures, at the foot of the tree.
sāpi dṛṣṭvā tamāyāntaṃ vṛkṣe tasminnalakṣitam / āruhya tasthau śākhāyāṃ pattraughacchannavigrahā //	She too saw him coming, and climbed up the tree without being noticed, and remained there on a bough, having her body concealed by the dense foliage.
sa cāgatya vaṇigyāvatsabhṛtyaḥ pāśabandhanam / ḍombameva tamadrākṣīnna tu siddhikarīṃ kvacit //	When the merchant came up with his servants he saw the Ḍomba hanging by his neck, but Siddhikarī was nowhere to be seen.
mā nāma vṛkṣamārūḍhā sā bhavediti tatkṣaṇam / eko 'sya vaṇijo bhṛtyastarumārohati sma tam //	Immediately one of his servants said, “I wonder whether she has got up this tree,” and proceeded to ascend it himself.
sadā tvayyeva me prītirihārūḍhastvameva ca / tatsundara tavaivedaṃ dhanamehi bhajasva mām //	Then Siddhikarī said: “I have always loved you, and now you have climbed up where I am, so all this wealth is at your disposal, handsome man;
ityuktvāliṅgya cumbantī sāsya siddhikarī mukham / vaṇigbhṛtyasya daśanairjihvāṃ mūḍhadhiyo 'cchinat //	come and embrace me.” So she embraced the merchant’s servant, and as she was kissing his mouth she bit off the fool’s tongue.
sa papāta vyathākrānto mukhena rudhiraṃ vaman / vṛkṣāttasmāllalalleti kimapyaprasphuṭaṃ bruvan // taddṛṣṭvā sa vaṇigbhīto bhūtagrastamavetya tam / svagṛhaṃ bhṛtyasahitaḥ palāyyaiva tato yayau //	He, overcome with pain, fell from that tree, spitting blood from his mouth, uttering some indistinct syllables, which sounded like “Lalalla.” When he saw that, the merchant was terrified, and supposing that his servant had been seized by a demon, he fled from that place, and went to his own house with his attendants.
athāvatīrya vṛkṣāgrāttadvadbhītā ca tāpasī / āgādgṛhaṃ samādāya tatsā siddhikarī dhanam //	Then Siddhikarī, the female ascetic, equally frightened, descended from the top of the tree, and brought home with her all that wealth.
evaṃvidhā hi macchiṣyā bahuprajñānaśālinī / evaṃ ca tatprasādena putrāḥ prāptaṃ mayā dhanam //	Such a person is my pupil, distinguished for her great discernment, and it is in this way, my sons, that I have obtained wealth by her kindness.
ityuktvā tānvaṇikputrānatha pravrājikā nijām / tatkālamāgatāṃ śiṣyāmetebhyastāmadarśayat // jagāda caitāṃs tatputrāḥ sadbhāvaṃ vadatādhunā / kāṃ striyaṃ vāñchatha kṣipraṃ tāmahaṃ sādhayāmi vaḥ // tacchrutvā te ca tāmūcuryaiṣā devasmitābhidhā / guhasenavaṇigbhāryā tayā naḥ saṃgamaṃ kuru // śrutveti pratijajñe tatkāryaṃ pravrājikātha sā / vaṇiksutānāṃ caiteṣāṃ svagṛhaṃ sthitaye dadau //	When she had said this to the young merchants the female ascetic showed to them her pupil, who happened to come in at that moment, and said to them: “Now, my sons, tell me the real state of affairs—what woman do you desire? I will quickly procure her for you.” When they heard that they said: “Procure us an interview with the wife of the merchant Guhasena named Devasmitā.” When she heard that, the ascetic undertook to manage that business for them, and she gave those young merchants her own house to reside in.
rañjayitvātha tatratyaṃ janaṃ bhakṣyādidānataḥ / guhasenagṛhaṃ tatsā viveśa saha śiṣyayā //	Then she gratified the servants at Guhasena’s house with gifts of sweetmeats and other things, and afterwards entered it with her pupil.
tato devasmitāvāsagṛhadvāramupāgatām / tāṃ śunī śṛṅkhalābaddhā rurodhāpūrvarodhinī //	Then, as she approached the private rooms of Devasmitā, a bitch, that was fastened there with a chain, would not let her come near, but opposed her entrance in the most determined way.
tato devasmitā dṛṣṭvā sā tāṃ prāveśayatsvayam / kim āgatā syād eṣeti vicintya preṣya ceṭikām // praviṣṭā cāśiṣaṃ dattvā kṛtvā vyājakṛtādarām / sā tāṃ devasmitāṃ sādhvīṃ pāpā pravrājikābravīt // sadaiva tvaddidṛkṣā me bhavatyadya punarmayā / svapne dṛṣṭāsi tenāhamutkā tvāṃ draṣṭumāgatā //	Then Devasmitā seeing her, of her own accord sent a maid, and had her brought in, thinking to herself: “What can this person be come for?” After she had entered, the wicked ascetic gave Devasmitā her blessing, and, treating the virtuous woman with affected respect, said to her: “I have always had a desire to see you, but to-day I saw you in a dream, therefore I have come to visit you with impatient eagerness;
bhartrā vinākṛtāṃ tvāṃ ca dṛṣṭvā me dūyate manaḥ / priyopabhogavandhye hi viphale rūpayauvane // ityādibhirvacobhistāṃ sādhvīmāśvāsya sā ciram / āmantrya cāyayau tāvadgṛhaṃ pravrājikā nijam //	and my mind is afflicted at beholding you separated from your husband, for beauty and youth are wasted when one is deprived of the society of one’s beloved.” With this and many other speeches of the same kind she tried to gain the confidence of the virtuous woman in a short interview, and then taking leave of her she returned to her own house.
dvitīye 'hni gṛhītvā ca maricakṣodanirbharam / māṃsakhaṇḍaṃ punaḥ sā tadyayau devasmitāgṛham // dvāraśunyai dadau tasyai māṃsakhaṇḍaṃ ca tatra tam / sāpi taṃ bhakṣayāmāsa sadyaḥ samaricaṃ śunī //	On the second day she took with her a piece of meat full of pepper dust, and went again to the house of Devasmitā, and there she gave that piece of meat to the bitch at the door, and the bitch gobbled it up, pepper and all.
tato maricadoṣeṇa tasyā dṛgbhyāmavāritam / aśru pravavṛte tasyāḥ prasnauti sma ca nāsikā //	Then owing to the pepper dust the tears flowed in profusion from the animal’s eyes, and her nose began to run.
sāpi pravrājikā tasmin kṣaṇe devasmitāntikam / praviśya tatkṛtātithyā prārebhe rodituṃ śaṭhā //	And the cunning ascetic immediately went into the apartment of Devasmitā, who received her hospitably, and began to cry.
pṛṣṭā ca devasmitayā sā kṛcchrādevamabravīt / putri saṃprati paśyaitāṃ bahiḥ prarudatīṃ śunīm // eṣā hyadya parijñāya māṃ janmāntarasaṃgatām / pravṛttā rodituṃ tena kṛpayāśru mamodgatam // tacchrutvā bahirālokya śunīṃ tāṃ rudatīmiva / kimetaccitramiti sā dadhyau devasmitā kṣaṇam // pravrājikātha sāvādītputri pūrvatra janmani / ahameṣā ca bhārye dve viprasyābhūva kasyacit //	When Devasmitā asked her why she shed tears she said with affected reluctance: “My friend, look at this bitch weeping outside here.[8] This creature recognised me to-day as having been its companion in a former birth, and began to weep; for that reason my tears gushed through pity.” When she heard that, and saw that bitch outside apparently weeping, Devasmitā thought for a moment to herself: “What can be the meaning of this wonderful sight?” Then the ascetic said to her: “My daughter, in a former birth I and that bitch were the two wives of a certain Brāhman.
sa cāvayoḥ patirdūraṃ deśāntaramitastataḥ / vāraṃ vāraṃ prayāti sma rājādeśena dūtyayā //	And our husband frequently went about to other countries on embassies by order of the king.
tatpravāse ca kurvantyā svecchaṃ puruṣasaṃgamam / mayā bhūtendriyagrāmo nopabhogairavañcyata //	Now while he was away from home I lived with other men at my pleasure, and so did not cheat the elements, of which I was composed, and my senses, of their lawful enjoyment.
