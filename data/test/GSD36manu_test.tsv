mṛte bhartari sāḍhvī strī brahmacarye vyavasthitā / svargaṃ gacchaty aputrāpi yathā te brahmacāriṇaḥ // apatyalobhād yā tu strī bhartāram ativartate / seha nindām avāpnoti paralokāc ca hīyate //	A virtuous wife who after the death of her husband constantly remains chaste, reaches heaven, though she have no son, just like those chaste men. But a woman who from a desire to have offspring violates her duty towards her (deceased) husband, brings on herself disgrace in this world, and loses her place with her husband (in heaven).
nānyotpannā prajāstīha na cāpy anyaparigrahe / na dvitīyaś ca sādhvīnāṃ kva cid bhartopadiśyate //	Offspring begotten by another man is here not (considered lawful), nor (does offspring begotten) on another man's wife (belong to the begetter), nor is a second husband anywhere prescribed for virtuous women.
patiṃ hitvāpakṛṣṭaṃ svam utkṛṣṭaṃ yā niṣevate / nindyaiva sā bhavel loke parapūrveti cocyate //	She who cohabits with a man of higher caste, forsaking her own husband who belongs to a lower one, will become contemptible in this world, and is called a remarried woman (parapurva).
vyabhicārāt tu bhartuḥ strī loke prāpnoti nindyatām / śṛgālayoniṃ prāpnoti pāparogaiś ca pīḍyate //	By violating her duty towards her husband, a wife is disgraced in this world, (after death) she enters the womb of a jackal, and is tormented by diseases (the punishment of) her sin.
