so'haṃ sabhājyo bandhūnāṃ suhṛdāṃ caiva rāghava| yasyāgnisākṣikaṃ mitraṃ labdhaṃ rāghavavaṃśajam||	I, who have, in the presence of Fire, gained for my friend (you) sprung from the Rāghava race, am, O Rāghava worthy of being honoured by my friends and relations.
ahamapyanurūpaste vayasyo jñāsyase śanaiḥ| na tu vaktuṃ samartho'haṃ tvayi ātmagatān guṇān||	You also shall by and by learn that I am a fit friend for you; but I can not speak to you of the qualities that abide in me.
mahātmanāṃ tu bhūyiṣṭhaṃ tvadvidhānāṃ kṛtātmanām| niścalā bhavati prītidhairyamātmavatāṃ vara||	O free one, the felicity of high-souled and self-governed friends like you abounds and is enduring.
rajataṃ vā suvarṇaṃ vā śubhānyābharaṇāni ca| avibhaktāni sādhūnāmavagacchanti sādhava :|7||	Pious friends look upon the silver, and gold, and the elegant ornaments of pious friends as common property.
āḍhyo vāpi daridro vā duḥkhitaḥ sukhito'pi vā| nirdoṣaśca sadoṣaśca vayasyaḥ paramā gatiḥ||	Whether rich or poor, happy or miserable, good or bad, a friend is the greatest refuge (of his friend).
