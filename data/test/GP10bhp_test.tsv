patim prayāntam subalasya putrī pati vratā ca anujagāma sādhvī himālayam nyasta daṇḍa praharṣam manasvinām iva sat samprahāraḥ	The gentle and chaste Gāndhārī, who was the daughter of King Subala of Kandahar [or Gāndhāra], followed her husband, seeing that he was going to the Himālaya Mountains, which are the delight of those who have accepted the staff of the renounced order like fighters who have accepted a good lashing from the enemy.
ajāta śatruḥ kṛta maitraḥ huta agniḥ viprān natvā tila go bhūmi rukmaiḥ gṛham praviṣṭaḥ guru vandanāya na ca apaśyat pitarau saubalīm ca	Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, whose enemy was never born, performed his daily morning duties by praying, offering fire sacrifice to the sun-god, and offering obeisances, grains, cows, land and gold to the brāhmaṇas. He then entered the palace to pay respects to the elderly. However, he could not find his uncles or aunt, the daughter of King Subala.
tatra sañjayam āsīnam papraccha udvigna mānasaḥ gāvalgaṇe kva naḥ tātaḥ vṛddhaḥ hīnaḥ ca netrayoḥ	Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, full of anxiety, turned to Sañjaya, who was sitting there, and said: O Sañjaya, where is our uncle, who is old and blind?
ambā ca hata putrā ārtā pitṛvyaḥ kva gataḥ suhṛt api mayi akṛta prajñe hata bandhuḥ saḥ bhāryayā āśaṁsamānaḥ śamalam gaṅgāyām duḥkhitaḥ apatat	Where is my well-wisher, uncle Vidura, and mother Gāndhārī, who is very afflicted due to all her sons’ demise? My uncle Dhṛtarāṣṭra was also very mortified due to the death of all his sons and grandsons. Undoubtedly I am very ungrateful. Did he, therefore, take my offenses very seriously and, along with his wife, drown himself in the Ganges?
pitari uparate pāṇḍau sarvān naḥ suhṛdaḥ śiśūn arakṣatām vyasanataḥ pitṛvyau kva gatau itaḥ	When my father, Pāṇḍu, fell down and we were all small children, these two uncles gave us protection from all kinds of calamities. They were always our good well-wishers. Alas, where have they gone from here?
sūtaḥ uvāca kṛpayā sneha vaiklavyāt sūtaḥ viraha karśitaḥ ātma īśvaram acakṣāṇaḥ na pratyāha ati pīḍitaḥ	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Because of compassion and mental agitation, Sañjaya, not having seen his own master, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, was aggrieved and could not properly reply to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira.
vimṛjya aśrūṇi pāṇibhyām viṣṭabhya ātmānam ātmanā ajāta śatrum pratyūce prabhoḥ pādau anusmaran	First he slowly pacified his mind by intelligence, and wiping away his tears and thinking of the feet of his master, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, he began to reply to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira.
sañjayaḥ uvāca na aham veda vyavasitam pitroḥ vaḥ kula nandana gāndhāryāḥ vā mahā bāho muṣitaḥ asmi mahā ātmabhiḥ	Sañjaya said: My dear descendant of the Kuru dynasty, I have no information of the determination of your two uncles and Gāndhārī. O King, I have been cheated by those great souls.
atha ājagāma bhagavān nāradaḥ saha tumburuḥ pratyutthāya abhivādya āha sa anujaḥ abhyarcayan munim	While Sañjaya was thus speaking, Śrī Nārada, the powerful devotee of the Lord, appeared on the scene carrying his tumburu. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers received him properly by getting up from their seats and offering obeisances.
yudhiṣṭhiraḥ uvāca na aham veda gatim pitroḥ bhagavan kva gatau itaḥ ambā vā hata putrā ārtā kva gatā ca tapasvinī	Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira said: O godly personality, I do not know where my two uncles have gone. Nor can I find my ascetic aunt who is griefstricken by the loss of all her sons.
karṇa dhāraḥ iva apāre bhagavān pāra darśakaḥ atha ābabhāṣe bhagavān nāradaḥ muni sat tamaḥ	You are like a captain of a ship in a great ocean and you can direct us to our destination. Thus addressed, the godly personality, Devarṣi Nārada, greatest of the philosopher devotees, began to speak.
nāradaḥ uvāca mā kañcana śucaḥ rājan yat īśvara vaśam jagat lokāḥ sa pālāḥ yasya ime vahanti balim īśituḥ saḥ saṁyunakti bhūtāni saḥ eva viyunakti ca	Śrī Nārada said: O pious King, do not lament for anyone, for everyone is under the control of the Supreme Lord. Therefore all living beings and their leaders carry on worship to be well protected. It is He only who brings them together and disperses them.
yathā gāvaḥ nasi protāḥ tantyām baddhāḥ ca dāmabhiḥ vāk tantyām nāmabhiḥ baddhāḥ vahanti balim īśituḥ	As a cow, bound through the nose by a long rope, is conditioned, so also human beings are bound by different Vedic injunctions and are conditioned to obey the orders of the Supreme.
yathā krīḍa upaskarāṇām saṁyoga vigamau iha icchayā krīḍituḥ syātām tathā eva īśa icchayā nṛṇām	As a player sets up and disperses his playthings according to his own sweet will, so the supreme will of the Lord brings men together and separates them.
yat manyase dhruvam lokam adhruvam vā na ca ubhayam sarvathā na hi śocyāḥ te snehāt anyatra moha jāt	O King, in all circumstances, whether you consider the soul to be an eternal principle, or the material body to be perishable, or everything to exist in the impersonal Absolute Truth, or everything to be an inexplicable combination of matter and spirit, feelings of separation are due only to illusory affection and nothing more.
tasmāt jahi aṅga vaiklavyam ajñāna kṛtam ātmanaḥ katham tu anāthāḥ kṛpaṇāḥ varteran te ca mām vinā	Therefore give up your anxiety due to ignorance of the self. You are now thinking of how they, who are helpless poor creatures, will exist without you.
kāla karma guṇa adhīnaḥ dehaḥ ayam pāñca bhautikaḥ katham anyān tu gopāyet sarpa grastaḥ yathā param	This gross material body made of five elements is already under the control of eternal time [kāla], action [karma] and the modes of material nature [guṇa]. How then can it, being already in the jaws of the serpent, protect others?
ahastāni sa hastānām apadāni catuḥ padām phalgūni tatra mahatām jīvaḥ jīvasya jīvanam	Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another.
tat idam bhagavān rājan ekaḥ ātmā ātmanām sva dṛk antaraḥ anantaraḥ bhāti paśya tam māyayā urudhā	Therefore, O King, you should look to the Supreme Lord only, who is one without a second and who manifests Himself by different energies and is both within and without.
saḥ ayam adya mahārāja bhagavān bhūta bhāvanaḥ kāla rūpaḥ avatīrṇaḥ asyām abhāvāya sura dviṣām	That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, in the guise of all-devouring time [kāla-rūpa] has now descended to the earth to eliminate the envious from the world.
niṣpāditam deva kṛtyam avaśeṣam pratīkṣate tāvat yūyam avekṣadhvam bhavet yāvat iha īśvaraḥ	The Lord has already performed His duties to help the demigods, and He is awaiting the rest. You Pāṇḍavas may wait as long as the Lord is here on earth.

srotobhiḥ saptabhiḥ yā vai svardhunī saptadhā vyadhāt saptānām prītaye nānā sapta srotaḥ pracakṣate	The place is called Saptasrota [“divided by seven”] because there the waters of the sacred Ganges were divided into seven branches. This was done for the satisfaction of the seven great ṛṣis.
snātvā anusavanam tasmin hutvā ca agnīn yathā vidhi ap bhakṣaḥ upaśānta ātmā saḥ āste vigata eṣaṇaḥ	On the banks at Saptasrota, Dhṛtarāṣṭra is now engaged in beginning aṣṭāṅga-yoga by bathing three times daily, in the morning, noon and evening, by performing the Agni-hotra sacrifice with fire and by drinking only water. This helps one control the mind and the senses and frees one completely from thoughts of familial affection.
jita āsanaḥ jita śvāsaḥ pratyāhṛta ṣaṭ indriyaḥ hari bhāvanayā dhvasta rajaḥ sattva tamaḥ malaḥ	One who has controlled the sitting postures [the yogic āsanas] and the breathing process can turn the senses toward the Absolute Personality of Godhead and thus become immune to the contaminations of the modes of material nature, namely mundane goodness, passion and ignorance.
vijñāna ātmani saṁyojya kṣetra jñe pravilāpya tam brahmaṇi ātmānam ādhāre ghaṭa ambaram iva ambare	Dhṛtarāṣṭra will have to amalgamate his pure identity with intelligence and then merge into the Supreme Being with knowledge of his qualitative oneness, as a living entity, with the Supreme Brahman. Being freed from the blocked sky, he will have to rise to the spiritual sky.
dhvasta māyā guṇa udarkaḥ niruddha karaṇa āśayaḥ nivartita akhila āhāraḥ āste sthāṇuḥ iva acalaḥ tasya antarāyaḥ mā eva abhūḥ sannyasta akhila karmaṇaḥ	He will have to suspend all the actions of the senses, even from the outside, and will have to be impervious to interactions of the senses, which are influenced by the modes of material nature. After renouncing all material duties, he must become immovably established, beyond all sources of hindrances on the path.
saḥ vā adya tanāt rājan parataḥ pañcame ahani kalevaram hāsyati svam tat ca bhasmī bhaviṣyati	O King, he will quit his body, most probably on the fifth day from today. And his body will turn to ashes.
dahyamāne agnibhiḥ dehe patyuḥ patnī saha uṭaje bahiḥ sthitā patim sādhvī tam agnim anu vekṣyati	While outside observing her husband, who will burn in the fire of mystic power along with his thatched cottage, his chaste wife will enter the fire with rapt attention.
viduraḥ tu tat āścaryam niśāmya kuru nandana harṣa śoka yutaḥ tasmāt gantā tīrtha niṣevakaḥ	Vidura, being affected with delight and grief, will then leave that place of sacred pilgrimage.
iti uktvā atha āruhat svargam nāradaḥ saha tumburuḥ yudhiṣṭhiraḥ vacaḥ tasya hṛdi kṛtvā ajahāt śucaḥ	Having spoken thus, the great sage Nārada, along with his vīṇā, ascended into outer space. Yudhiṣṭhira kept his instruction in his heart and so was able to get rid of all lamentations.
sūtaḥ uvāca samprasthite dvārakāyām jiṣṇau bandhu didṛkṣayā jñātum ca puṇya ślokasya kṛṣṇasya ca viceṣṭitam	Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: Arjuna went to Dvārakā to see Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and other friends and also to learn from the Lord of His next activities.
vyatītāḥ katicit māsāḥ tadā na āyāt tataḥ arjunaḥ dadarśa ghora rūpāṇi nimittāni kuru udvahaḥ	A few months passed, and Arjuna did not return. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira then began to observe some inauspicious omens, which were fearful in themselves.
kālasya ca gatim raudrām viparyasta ṛtu dharmiṇaḥ pāpīyasīm nṛṇām vārtām krodha lobha anṛta ātmanām	He saw that the direction of eternal time had changed, and this was very fearful. There were disruptions in the seasonal regularities. The people in general had become very greedy, angry and deceitful. And he saw that they were adopting foul means of livelihood.
jihma prāyam vyavahṛtam śāṭhya miśram ca sauhṛdam pitṛ mātṛ suhṛt bhrātṛ dam patīnām ca kalkanam	All ordinary transactions and dealings became polluted with cheating, even between friends. And in familial affairs, there was always misunderstanding between fathers, mothers and sons, between well-wishers, and between brothers. Even between husband and wife there was always strain and quarrel.
nimittāni ati ariṣṭāni kāle tu anugate nṛṇām lobha ādi adharma prakṛtim dṛṣṭvā uvāca anujam nṛpaḥ	In course of time it came to pass that people in general became accustomed to greed, anger, pride, etc. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, observing all these omens, spoke to his younger brother.

gatāḥ sapta adhunā māsāḥ bhīmasena tava anujaḥ na āyāti kasya vā hetoḥ na aham veda idam añjasā	Since he departed, seven months have passed, yet he has not returned. I do not know factually how things are going there.
api deva ṛṣiṇā ādiṣṭaḥ saḥ kālaḥ ayam upasthitaḥ yadā ātmanaḥ aṅgam ākrīḍam bhagavān utsisṛkṣati	Is He going to quit His earthly pastimes, as Devarṣi Nārada indicated? Has that time already arrived?
yasmāt naḥ sampadaḥ rājyam dārāḥ prāṇāḥ kulam prajāḥ āsan sapatna vijayaḥ lokāḥ ca yat anugrahāt	From Him only, all our kingly opulence, good wives, lives, progeny, control over our subjects, victory over our enemies, and future accommodations in higher planets have become possible. All this is due to His causeless mercy upon us.
paśya utpātān nara vyāghra divyān bhaumān sa daihikān dāruṇān śaṁsataḥ adūrāt bhayam naḥ buddhi mohanam	Just see, O man with a tiger’s strength, how many miseries due to celestial influences, earthly reactions and bodily pains — all very dangerous in themselves — are foreboding danger in the near future by deluding our intelligence.

mṛtyu dūtaḥ kapotaḥ ayam ulūkaḥ kampayan manaḥ pratyulūkaḥ ca kuhvānaiḥ viśvam vai śūnyam icchataḥ	Just see! This pigeon is like a messenger of death. The shrieks of the owls and their rival crows make my heart tremble. It appears that they want to make a void of the whole universe.
dhūmrāḥ diśaḥ paridhayaḥ kampate bhūḥ saha adribhiḥ nirghātaḥ ca mahān tāta sākam ca stanayitnubhiḥ	Just see how the smoke encircles the sky. It appears that the earth and mountains are throbbing. Just hear the cloudless thunder and see the bolts from the blue.
vāyuḥ vāti khara sparśaḥ rajasā visṛjan tamaḥ asṛk varṣanti jaladāḥ bībhatsam iva sarvataḥ	The wind blows violently, blasting dust everywhere and creating darkness. Clouds are raining everywhere with bloody disasters.
sūryam hata prabham paśya graha mardam mithaḥ divi sa saṅkulaiḥ bhūta gaṇaiḥ jvalite iva rodasī	The rays of the sun are declining, and the stars appear to be fighting amongst themselves. Confused living entities appear to be ablaze and weeping.

They seem about to leave. All the cities, villages, towns, gardens, mines and hermitages are now devoid of beauty and bereft of all happiness.

manye etaiḥ mahā utpātaiḥ nūnam bhagavataḥ padaiḥ ananya puruṣa śrībhiḥ hīnā bhūḥ hata saubhagā	I think that all these earthly disturbances indicate some greater loss to the good fortune of the world.

And only by His grace was the demon named Maya saved from the blazing Khāṇḍava Forest, and thus we could build our assembly house of wonderful architectural workmanship, where all the princes assembled during the performance of Rājasūya-yajña and paid you tributes.
yat tejasā nṛpa śiraḥ aṅghrim ahan makha artham āryaḥ anujaḥ tava gaja ayuta sattva vīryaḥ tena āhṛtāḥ pramatha nātha makhāya bhūpāḥ yat mocitāḥ tat anayan balim adhvare te	Your respectable younger brother, who possesses the strength of ten thousand elephants, killed, by His grace, Jarāsandha, whose feet were worshiped by many kings.

At that time she fell down at the feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa with tears in her eyes.
yaḥ naḥ jugopa vane etya duranta kṛcchrāt durvāsasaḥ ari racitāt ayuta agra bhuk yaḥ śāka anna śiṣṭam upayujya yataḥ tri lokīm tṛptām amaṁsta salile vinimagna saṅghaḥ	During our exile, Durvāsā Muni, who eats with his ten thousand disciples, intrigued with our enemies to put us in dangerous trouble. At that time He [Lord Kṛṣṇa], simply by accepting the remnants of food, saved us. By His accepting food thus, the assembly of munis, while bathing in the river, felt sumptuously fed. And all the three worlds were also satisfied.
yat tejasā atha bhagavān yudhi śūla pāṇiḥ vismāpitaḥ sa girijaḥ astram adāt nijam me anye api ca aham amunā eva kalevareṇa prāptaḥ mahā indra bhavane mahat āsana ardham	It was by His influence only that in a fight I was able to astonish the personality of god Lord Śiva and his wife, the daughter of Mount Himālaya. Thus he [Lord Śiva] became pleased with me and awarded me his own weapon. Other demigods also delivered their respective weapons to me, and in addition I was able to reach the heavenly planets in this present body and was allowed a half-elevated seat.
tatra eva me viharataḥ bhuja daṇḍa yugmam gāṇḍīva lakṣaṇam arāti vadhāya devāḥ sa indrāḥ śritāḥ yat anubhāvitam ājamīḍha tena aham adya muṣitaḥ puruṣeṇa bhūmnā	When I stayed for some days as a guest in the heavenly planets, all the heavenly demigods, including King Indradeva, took shelter of my arms, which were marked with the Gāṇḍīva bow, to kill the demon named Nivātakavaca. O King, descendant of Ajamīḍha, at the present moment I am bereft of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whose influence I was so powerful.
yat bāndhavaḥ kuru bala abdhim ananta pāram ekaḥ rathena tatare aham atīrya sattvam pratyāhṛtam bahu dhanam ca mayā pareṣām tejāḥ padam maṇi mayam ca hṛtam śirobhyaḥ	The military strength of the Kauravas was like an ocean in which there dwelled many invincible existences, and thus it was insurmountable. But because of His friendship, I, seated on the chariot, was able to cross over it. And only by His grace was I able to regain the cows and also collect by force many helmets of the kings, which were bedecked with jewels that were sources of all brilliance.
yaḥ bhīṣma karṇa guru śalya camūṣu adabhra rājanya varya ratha maṇḍala maṇḍitāsu agecaraḥ mama vibho ratha yūtha pānām āyuḥ manāṁsi ca dṛśā sahaḥ ojaḥ ārcchat	It was He only who withdrew the duration of life from everyone and who, in the battlefield, withdrew the speculative power and strength of enthusiasm from the great military phalanx made by the Kauravas, headed by Bhīṣma, Karṇa, Droṇa, Śalya, etc. Their arrangement was expert and more than adequate, but He [Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa], while going forward, did all this.
yat doḥṣu mā praṇihitam guru bhīṣma karṇa naptṛ trigarta śalya saindhava bāhlika ādyaiḥ astrāṇi amogha mahimāni nirūpitāni na upaspṛśuḥ nṛhari dāsam iva asurāṇi	Great generals like Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Bhūriśravā, Suśarmā, Śalya, Jayadratha and Bāhlika all directed their invincible weapons against me. But by His [Lord Kṛṣṇa’s] grace they could not even touch a hair on my head. Similarly, Prahlāda Mahārāja, the supreme devotee of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, was unaffected by the weapons the demons used against him.
sautye vṛtaḥ kumatinā ātma daḥ īśvaraḥ me yat pāda padmam abhavāya bhajanti bhavyāḥ mām śrānta vāham arayaḥ rathinaḥ bhuvi ṣṭham na prāharan yat anubhāva nirasta cittāḥ	It was by His mercy only that my enemies neglected to kill me when I descended from my chariot to get water for my thirsty horses. And it was due to my lack of esteem for my Lord that I dared engage Him as my chariot driver, for He is worshiped and offered services by the best men to attain salvation.
narmāṇi udāra rucira smita śobhitāni he pārtha he arjuna sakhe kuru nandana iti sañjalpitāni nara deva hṛdi spṛśāni smartuḥ luṭhanti hṛdayam mama mādhavasya	O King! His jokings and frank talks were pleasing and beautifully decorated with smiles. His addresses unto me as “O son of Pṛthā, O friend, O son of the Kuru dynasty,” and all such heartiness are now remembered by me, and thus I am overwhelmed.
śayya āsana aṭana vikatthana bhojana ādiṣu aikyāt vayasya ṛtavān iti vipralabdhaḥ sakhyuḥ sakhā iva pitṛvat tanayasya sarvam sehe mahān mahitayā kumateḥ agham me	Generally both of us used to live together and sleep, sit and loiter together. And at the time of advertising oneself for acts of chivalry, sometimes, if there were any irregularity, I used to reproach Him by saying, “My friend, You are very truthful.” Even in those hours when His value was minimized, He, being the Supreme Soul, used to tolerate all those utterings of mine, excusing me exactly as a true friend excuses his true friend, or a father excuses his son.
saḥ aham nṛpa indra rahitaḥ puruṣa uttamena sakhyā priyeṇa suhṛdā hṛdayena śūnyaḥ adhvani urukrama parigraham aṅga rakṣan gopaiḥ asadbhiḥ abalā iva vinirjitaḥ asmi	O Emperor, now I am separated from my friend and dearmost well-wisher, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore my heart appears to be void of everything. In His absence I have been defeated by a number of infidel cowherd men while I was guarding the bodies of all the wives of Kṛṣṇa.
tat vai dhanuḥ te iṣavaḥ saḥ rathaḥ hayāḥ te saḥ aham rathī nṛpatayaḥ yataḥ ānamanti sarvam kṣaṇena tat abhūt asat īśa riktam bhasman hutam kuhaka rāddham iva uptam ūṣyām	I have the very same Gāṇḍīva bow, the same arrows, the same chariot drawn by the same horses, and I use them as the same Arjuna to whom all the kings offered their due respects. But in the absence of Lord Kṛṣṇa, all of them, at a moment’s notice, have become null and void. It is exactly like offering clarified butter on ashes, accumulating money with a magic wand or sowing seeds on barren land.
rājan tvayā anupṛṣṭānām suhṛdām naḥ suhṛt pure vipra śāpa vimūḍhānām nighnatām muṣṭibhiḥ mithaḥ vāruṇīm madirām pītvā mada unmathita cetasām ajānatām iva anyonyam catuḥ pañca avaśeṣitāḥ	O King, since you have asked me about our friends and relatives in the city of Dvārakā, I will inform you that all of them were cursed by the brāhmaṇas, and as a result they all became intoxicated with wine made of putrefied rice and fought among themselves with sticks, not even recognizing one another. Now all but four or five of them are dead and gone.
prāyeṇa etat bhagavataḥ īśvarasya viceṣṭitam mithaḥ nighnanti bhūtāni bhāvayanti ca yat mithaḥ	Factually this is all due to the supreme will of the Lord, the Personality of Godhead. Sometimes people kill one another, and at other times they protect one another.
jalaukasām jale yadvat mahāntaḥ adanti aṇīyasaḥ durbalān balinaḥ rājan mahāntaḥ balinaḥ mithaḥ evam baliṣṭhaiḥ yadubhiḥ mahadbhiḥ itarān vibhuḥ yadūn yadubhiḥ anyonyam bhū bhārān sañjahāra ha	O King, as in the ocean the bigger and stronger aquatics swallow up the smaller and weaker ones, so also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to lighten the burden of the earth, has engaged the stronger Yadu to kill the weaker, and the bigger Yadu to kill the smaller.
deśa kāla artha yuktāni hṛt tāpa upaśamāni ca haranti smarataḥ cittam govinda abhihitāni me	Now I am attracted to those instructions imparted to me by the Personality of Godhead [Govinda] because they are impregnated with instructions for relieving the burning heart in all circumstances of time and space.
sūtaḥ uvāca evam cintayataḥ jiṣṇoḥ kṛṣṇa pāda saroruham sauhārdena ati gāḍhena śāntā āsīt vimalā matiḥ	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Thus being deeply absorbed in thinking of the instructions of the Lord, which were imparted in the great intimacy of friendship, and in thinking of His lotus feet, Arjuna’s mind became pacified and free from all material contamination.
vāsudeva aṅghri anudhyāna paribṛṁhita raṁhasā bhaktyā nirmathita aśeṣa kaṣāya dhiṣaṇaḥ arjunaḥ	Arjuna’s constant remembrance of the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa rapidly increased his devotion, and as a result all the trash in his thoughts subsided.
gītam bhagavatā jñānam yat tat saṅgrāma mūrdhani kāla karma tamaḥ ruddham punaḥ adhyagamat prabhuḥ	Because of the Lord’s pastimes and activities and because of His absence, it appeared that Arjuna forgot the instructions left by the Personality of Godhead. But factually this was not the case, and again he became lord of his senses.
viśokaḥ brahma sampattyā sañchinna dvaita saṁśayaḥ līna prakṛti nairguṇyāt aliṅgatvāt asambhavaḥ	Because of his possessing spiritual assets, the doubts of duality were completely cut off. Thus he was freed from the three modes of material nature and placed in transcendence. There was no longer any chance of his becoming entangled in birth and death, for he was freed from material form.
niśamya bhagavat mārgam saṁsthām yadu kulasya ca svaḥ pathāya matim cakre nibhṛta ātmā yudhiṣṭhiraḥ	Upon hearing of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s returning to His abode, and upon understanding the end of the Yadu dynasty’s earthly manifestation, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira decided to go back home, back to Godhead.
pṛthā api anuśrutya dhanañjaya uditam nāśam yadūnām bhagavat gatim ca tām eka anta bhaktyā bhagavati adhokṣaje niveśita ātmā upararāma saṁsṛteḥ	Kuntī, after overhearing Arjuna’s telling of the end of the Yadu dynasty and disappearance of Lord Kṛṣṇa, engaged in the devotional service of the transcendental Personality of Godhead with full attention and thus gained release from the course of material existence.
yayā aharat bhuvaḥ bhāram tām tanum vijahau ajaḥ kaṇṭakam kaṇṭakena iva dvayam ca api īśituḥ samam	The supreme unborn, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their bodies, and thus He relieved the burden of the world. This action was like picking out a thorn with a thorn, though both are the same to the controller.
yathā matsya ādi rūpāṇi dhatte jahyāt yathā naṭaḥ bhū bhāraḥ kṣapitaḥ yena jahau tat ca kalevaram	The Supreme Lord relinquished the body which He manifested to diminish the burden of the earth. Just like a magician, He relinquishes one body to accept different ones, like the fish incarnation and others.
yadā mukundaḥ bhagavān imām mahīm jahau sva tanvā śravaṇīya sat kathaḥ tadā ahaḥ eva aprati buddha cetasām abhadra hetuh kaliḥ anvavartata	When the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, left this earthly planet in His selfsame form, from that very day Kali, who had already partially appeared, became fully manifest to create inauspicious conditions for those who are endowed with a poor fund of knowledge.
yudhiṣṭhiraḥ tat parisarpaṇam budhaḥ pure ca rāṣṭre ca gṛhe tathā ātmani vibhāvya lobha anṛta jihma hiṁsana ādi adharma cakram gamanāya paryadhāt	Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was intelligent enough to understand the influence of the Age of Kali, characterized by increasing avarice, falsehood, cheating and violence throughout the capital, state, home and among individuals. So he wisely prepared himself to leave home, and he dressed accordingly.
sva rāṭ pautram vinayinam ātmanaḥ su samam guṇaiḥ toya nīvyāḥ patim bhūmeḥ abhyaṣiñcat gajāhvaye	Thereafter, in the capital of Hastināpura, he enthroned his grandson, who was trained and equally qualified, as the emperor and master of all land bordered by the seas.
mathurāyām tathā vajram śūrasena patim tataḥ prājāpatyām nirūpya iṣṭim agnīn apibat īśvaraḥ	Then he posted Vajra, the son of Aniruddha [grandson of Lord Kṛṣṇa], at Mathurā as the King of Śūrasena. Afterwards Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira performed a Prājāpatya sacrifice and placed in himself the fire for quitting household life.
visṛjya tatra tat sarvam dukūla valaya ādikam nirmamaḥ nirahaṅkāraḥ sañchinna aśeṣa bandhanaḥ	Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira at once relinquished all his garments, belt and ornaments of the royal order and became completely disinterested and unattached to everything.
vācam juhāva manasi tat prāṇe itare ca tam mṛtyau apānam sa utsargam tam pañcatve hi ajohavīt	Then he amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind, then the mind into life, life into breathing, his total existence into the embodiment of the five elements, and his body into death. Then, as pure self, he became free from the material conception of life.
tritve hutvā ca pañcatvam tat ca ekatve ajuhot muniḥ sarvam ātmani ajuhavīt brahmaṇi ātmānam avyaye	Thus annihilating the gross body of five elements into the three qualitative modes of material nature, he merged them in one nescience and then absorbed that nescience in the self, Brahman, which is inexhaustible in all circumstances.
cīra vāsāḥ nirāhāraḥ baddha vāk mukta mūrdhajaḥ darśayan ātmanaḥ rūpam jaḍa unmatta piśāca vat anavekṣamāṇaḥ niragāt aśṛṇvan badhiraḥ yathā	After that, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira dressed himself in torn clothing, gave up eating all solid foods, voluntarily became dumb and let his hair hang loose. All this combined to make him look like an urchin or madman with no occupation. He did not depend on his brothers for anything. And, just like a deaf man, he heard nothing.
udīcīm praviveśa āśām gata pūrvām mahā ātmabhiḥ hṛdi brahma param dhyāyan na āvarteta yataḥ gataḥ	He then started towards the north, treading the path accepted by his forefathers and great men, to devote himself completely to the thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he lived in that way wherever he went.
sarve tam anunirjagmuḥ bhrātaraḥ kṛta niścayāḥ kalinā adharma mitreṇa dṛṣṭvā spṛṣṭāḥ prajāḥ bhuvi	The younger brothers of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira observed that the Age of Kali had already arrived throughout the world and that the citizens of the kingdom were already affected by irreligious practice. Therefore they decided to follow in the footsteps of their elder brother.
te sādhu kṛta sarva arthāḥ jñātvā ātyantikam ātmanaḥ manasā dhārayām āsuḥ vaikuṇṭha caraṇa ambujam	They all had performed all the principles of religion and as a result rightly decided that the lotus feet of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa are the supreme goal of all. Therefore they meditated upon His feet without interruption.
tat dhyāna utriktayā bhaktyā viśuddha dhiṣaṇāḥ pare tasmin nārāyaṇa pade ekānta matayaḥ gatim avāpuḥ duravāpām te asadbhiḥ viṣaya ātmabhiḥ vidhūta kalmaṣāḥ sthānam virajena ātmanā eva hi	Thus by pure consciousness due to constant devotional remembrance, they attained the spiritual sky, which is ruled over by the Supreme Nārāyaṇa, Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is attained only by those who meditate upon the one Supreme Lord without deviation. This abode of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, cannot be attained by persons who are absorbed in the material conception of life. But the Pāṇḍavas, being completely washed of all material contamination, attained that abode in their very same bodies.
viduraḥ api parityajya prabhāse deham ātmanaḥ kṛṣṇa āveśena tat cittaḥ pitṛbhiḥ sva kṣayam yayau	Vidura, while on pilgrimage, left his body at Prabhāsa. Because he was absorbed in thought of Kṛṣṇa, he was received by the denizens of the Pitṛloka planet, where he returned to his original post.
draupadī ca tadā ājñāya patīnām anapekṣatām vāsudeve bhagavati hi eka anta matiḥ āpa tam	Draupadī also saw that her husbands, without caring for her, were leaving home. She knew well about Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. Both she and Subhadrā became absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa and attained the same results as their husbands.
yaḥ śraddhayā etat bhagavat priyāṇām pāṇḍoḥ sutānām iti samprayāṇam śṛṇoti alam svastyayanam pavitram labdhvā harau bhaktim upaiti siddhim	The subject of the departure of the sons of Pāṇḍu for the ultimate goal of life, back to Godhead, is fully auspicious and is perfectly pure. Therefore anyone who hears this narration with devotional faith certainly gains the devotional service of the Lord, the highest perfection of life.
sūtaḥ uvāca tataḥ parīkṣit dvija varya śikṣayā mahīm mahā bhāgavataḥ śaśāsa ha yathā hi sūtyām abhijāta kovidāḥ samādiśan vipra mahat guṇaḥ tathā	Sūta Gosvāmī said: O learned brāhmaṇas, Mahārāja Parīkṣit then began to rule over the world as a great devotee of the Lord under the instructions of the best of the twice-born brāhmaṇas. He ruled by those great qualities which were foretold by expert astrologers at the time of his birth.
saḥ uttarasya tanayām upayeme irāvatīm janamejaya ādīn caturaḥ tasyām utpādayat sutān	King Parīkṣit married the daughter of King Uttara and begot four sons, headed by Mahārāja Janamejaya.
ājahāra aśva medhān trīn gaṅgāyām bhūri dakṣiṇān śāradvatam gurum kṛtvā devāḥ yatra akṣi gocarāḥ	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, after having selected Kṛpācārya for guidance as his spiritual master, performed three horse sacrifices on the banks of the Ganges. These were executed with sufficient rewards for the attendants. And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods.
nijagrāha ojasā vīraḥ kalim digvijaye kvacit nṛpa liṅga dharam śūdram ghnantam go mithunam padā	Once, when Mahārāja Parīkṣit was on his way to conquer the world, he saw the master of Kali-yuga, who was lower than a śūdra, disguised as a king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull. The King at once caught hold of him to deal sufficient punishment.
śaunakaḥ uvāca kasya hetoḥ nijagrāha kalim digvijaye nṛpaḥ nṛ deva cihna dhṛk śūdrakaḥ asau gām yaḥ padā ahanat tat kathyatām mahā bhāga yadi kṛṣṇa kathā āśrayam	Śaunaka Ṛṣi inquired: Why did Mahārāja Parīkṣit simply punish him, since he was the lowest of the śūdras, having dressed as a king and having struck a cow on the leg? Please describe all these incidents if they relate to the topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
athavā asya pada ambhoja makaranda lihām satām kim anyaiḥ asat ālāpaiḥ āyuṣaḥ yat asat vyayaḥ	The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord. What is the use of topics which simply waste one’s valuable life?
kṣudra āyuṣām nṛṇām aṅga martyānām ṛtam icchatām iha upahūtaḥ bhagavān mṛtyuḥ śāmitra karmaṇi	O Sūta Gosvāmī, there are those amongst men who desire freedom from death and get eternal life. They escape the slaughtering process by calling the controller of death, Yamarāja.
na kaścit mriyate tāvat yāvat āste iha antakaḥ etat artham hi bhagavān āhūtaḥ parama ṛṣibhiḥ aho nṛ loke pīyeta hari līlā amṛtam vacaḥ	As long as Yamarāja, who causes everyone’s death, is present here, no one shall meet with death. The great sages have invited the controller of death, Yamarāja, who is the representative of the Lord. Living beings who are under his grip should take advantage by hearing the deathless nectar in the form of this narration of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.
mandasya manda prajñasya vayaḥ manda āyuṣaḥ ca vai nidrayā hriyate naktam divā ca vyartha karmabhiḥ	Lazy human beings with paltry intelligence and a short duration of life pass the night sleeping and the day performing activities that are for naught.
sūtaḥ uvāca yadā parīkṣit kuru jāṅgale avasat kalim praviṣṭam nija cakravartite niśamya vārtām anati priyām tataḥ śarāsanam saṁyuga śauṇḍiḥ ādade	Sūta Gosvāmī said: While Mahārāja Parīkṣit was residing in the capital of the Kuru empire, the symptoms of the Age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities.
su alaṅkṛtam śyāma turaṅga yojitam ratham mṛga indra dhvajam āśritaḥ purāt vṛtaḥ ratha aśva dvipapatti yuktayā sva senayā digvijayāya nirgataḥ	Mahārāja Parīkṣit sat on a chariot drawn by black horses. His flag was marked with the sign of a lion. Being so decorated and surrounded by charioteers, cavalry, elephants and infantry soldiers, he left the capital to conquer in all directions.
bhadrāśvam ketumālam ca bhāratam ca uttarān kurūn kimpuruṣa ādīni varṣāṇi vijitya jagṛhe balim	Mahārāja Parīkṣit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet — Bhadrāśva, Ketumāla, Bhārata, the northern Kuru, Kimpuruṣa, etc. — and exacted tributes from their respective rulers.
tatra tatra upaśṛṇvānaḥ sva pūrveṣām mahā ātmanām pragīyamāṇam ca yaśaḥ kṛṣṇa māhātmya sūcakam ātmānam ca paritrātam aśvatthāmnaḥ astra tejasaḥ sneham ca vṛṣṇi pārthānām teṣām bhaktim ca keśave tebhyaḥ parama santuṣṭaḥ prīti ujjṛmbhita locanaḥ mahā dhanāni vāsāṁsi dadau hārān mahā manāḥ	Wherever the King visited, he continuously heard the glories of his great forefathers, who were all devotees of the Lord, and also of the glorious acts of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He also heard how he himself had been protected by the Lord from the powerful heat of the weapon of Aśvatthāmā. People also mentioned the great affection between the descendants of Vṛṣṇi and Pṛthā due to the latter’s great devotion to Lord Keśava. The King, being very pleased with the singers of such glories, opened his eyes in great satisfaction. Out of magnanimity he was pleased to award them very valuable necklaces and clothing.
sārathya pāraṣada sevana sakhya dautya vīra āsana anugamana stavana praṇāmān snigdheṣu pāṇḍuṣu jagat praṇatim ca viṣṇoḥ bhaktim karoti nṛ patiḥ caraṇa aravinde	Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard that out of His causeless mercy Lord Kṛṣṇa [Viṣṇu], who is universally obeyed, rendered all kinds of service to the malleable sons of Pāṇḍu by accepting posts ranging from chariot driver to president to messenger, friend, night watchman, etc., according to the will of the Pāṇḍavas, obeying them like a servant and offering obeisances like one younger in years. When he heard this, Mahārāja Parīkṣit became overwhelmed with devotion to the lotus feet of the Lord.
tasya evam vartamānasya pūrveṣām vṛttim anvaham na ati dūre kila āścaryam yat āsīt tat nibodha me	Now you may hear from me of what happened while Mahārāja Parīkṣit was passing his days hearing of the good occupations of his forefathers and being absorbed in thought of them.
dharmaḥ padā ekena caran vicchāyām upalabhya gām pṛcchati sma aśru vadanām vivatsām iva mātaram	The personality of religious principles, Dharma, was wandering about in the form of a bull. And he met the personality of earth in the form of a cow who appeared to grieve like a mother who had lost her child. She had tears in her eyes, and the beauty of her body was lost. Thus Dharma questioned the earth as follows.
dharmaḥ uvāca kaccit bhadre anāmayam ātmanaḥ te vicchāyā asi mlāyatā īṣat mukhena ālakṣaye bhavatīm antarādhim dūre bandhum śocasi kañcana amba	Dharma [in the form of a bull] asked: Madam, are you not hale and hearty? Why are you covered with the shadow of grief? It appears by your face that you have become black. Are you suffering from some internal disease, or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place?
pādaiḥ nyūnam śocasi mā eka pādam ātmānam vā vṛṣalaiḥ bhokṣyamāṇam āhoḥ sura ādīn hṛta yajña bhāgān prajāḥ uta svit maghavati avarṣati	I have lost my three legs and am now standing on one only. Are you lamenting for my state of existence? Or are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat-eaters will exploit you? Or are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial offerings because no sacrifices are being performed at present? Or are you grieving for living beings because of their sufferings due to famine and drought?
arakṣyamāṇāḥ striyaḥ urvi bālān śocasi atho puruṣa ādaiḥ iva ārtān vācam devīm brahma kule kukarmaṇi abrahmaṇye rāja kule kula agryān	Are you feeling compunction for the unhappy women and children who are left forlorn by unscrupulous persons? Or are you unhappy because the goddess of learning is being handled by brāhmaṇas addicted to acts against the principles of religion? Or are you sorry to see that the brāhmaṇas have taken shelter of administrative families that do not respect brahminical culture?
kim kṣatra bandhūn kalinā upasṛṣṭān rāṣṭrāṇi vā taiḥ avaropitāni itaḥ tataḥ vā aśana pāna vāsaḥ snāna vyavāya unmukha jīva lokam	The so-called administrators are now bewildered by the influence of this Age of Kali, and thus they have put all state affairs into disorder. Are you now lamenting this disorder? Now the general populace does not follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, mating, etc., and they are inclined to perform such anywhere and everywhere. Are you unhappy because of this?
yadvā amba te bhūri bhara avatāra kṛta avatārasya hareḥ dharitri antarhitasya smaratī visṛṣṭā karmāṇi nirvāṇa vilambitāni	O mother earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, incarnated Himself as Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa just to unload your heavy burden. All His activities here are transcendental, and they cement the path of liberation. You are now bereft of His presence. You are probably now thinking of those activities and feeling sorry in their absence.
idam mama ācakṣva tava ādhimūlam vasundhare yena vikarśitā asi kālena vā te balinām balīyasā sura arcitam kim hṛtam amba saubhagam	Mother, you are the reservoir of all riches. Please inform me of the root cause of your tribulations by which you have been reduced to such a weak state. I think that the powerful influence of time, which conquers the most powerful, might have forcibly taken away all your fortune, which was adored even by the demigods.
dharaṇī uvāca bhavān hi veda tat sarvam yat mām dharma anupṛcchasi caturbhiḥ vartase yena pādaiḥ loka sukha āvahaiḥ	The earthly deity [in the form of a cow] thus replied to the personality of religious principles [in the form of a bull]: O Dharma, whatever you have inquired from me shall be known to you. I shall try to reply to all those questions. Once you too were maintained by your four legs, and you increased happiness all over the universe by the mercy of the Lord.
satyam śaucam dayā kṣāntiḥ tyāgaḥ santoṣaḥ ārjavam śamaḥ damaḥ tapaḥ sāmyam titikṣā uparatiḥ śrutam jñānam viraktiḥ aiśvaryam śauryam tejaḥ balam smṛtiḥ svātantryam kauśalam kāntiḥ dhairyam mārdavam eva ca prāgalbhyam praśrayaḥ śīlam sahaḥ ojaḥ balam bhagaḥ gāmbhīryam sthairyam āstikyam kīrtiḥ mānaḥ anahaṅkṛtiḥ ete ca anye ca bhagavan nityāḥ yatra mahā guṇāḥ prārthyāḥ mahattvam icchadbhiḥ na viyanti sma karhicit tena aham guṇa pātreṇa śrī nivāsena sāmpratam śocāmi rahitam lokam pāpmanā kalinā īkṣitam	In Him reside (1) truthfulness, (2) cleanliness, (3) intolerance of another’s unhappiness, (4) the power to control anger, (5) self-satisfaction, (6) straightforwardness, (7) steadiness of mind, (8) control of the sense organs, (9) responsibility, (10) equality, (11) tolerance, (12) equanimity, (13) faithfulness, (14) knowledge, (15) absence of sense enjoyment, (16) leadership, (17) chivalry, (18) influence, (19) the power to make everything possible, (20) the discharge of proper duty, (21) complete independence, (22) dexterity, (23) fullness of all beauty, (24) serenity, (25) kindheartedness, (26) ingenuity, (27) gentility, (28) magnanimity, (29) determination, (30) perfection in all knowledge, (31) proper execution, (32) possession of all objects of enjoyment, (33) joyfulness, (34) immovability, (35) fidelity, (36) fame, (37) worship, (38) pridelessness, (39) being (as the Personality of Godhead), (40) eternity, and many other transcendental qualities which are eternally present and never to be separated from Him. That Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all goodness and beauty, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, has now closed His transcendental pastimes on the face of the earth. In His absence the Age of Kali has spread its influence everywhere, so I am sorry to see this condition of existence.
ātmānam ca anuśocāmi bhavantam ca amara uttamam devān pitṝn ṛṣīn sādhūn sarvān varṇān tathā āśramān	I am thinking about myself and also, O best amongst the demigods, about you, as well as about all the demigods, sages, denizens of Pitṛloka, devotees of the Lord and all men obedient to the system of varṇa and āśrama in human society.
brahma ādayaḥ bahu titham yat apāṅga mokṣa kāmāḥ tapaḥ samacaran bhagavat prapannāḥ sā śrīḥ sva vāsam aravinda vanam vihāya yat pāda saubhagam alam bhajate anuraktā tasya aham abja kuliśa aṅkuśa ketu ketaiḥ śrīmat padaiḥ bhagavataḥ samalaṅkṛta aṅgī trīn ati aroce upalabhya tataḥ vibhūtim lokān saḥ mām vyasṛjat utsmayatīm tat ante	Lakṣmījī, the goddess of fortune, whose glance of grace was sought by demigods like Brahmā and for whom they surrendered many a day unto the Personality of Godhead, gave up her own abode in the forest of lotus flowers and engaged herself in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. I was endowed with specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the impressions of the flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod and lotus flower, which are signs of the lotus feet of the Lord. But at the end, when I felt I was so fortunate, the Lord left me.
yaḥ vai mama ati bharam āsura vaṁśa rājñām akṣauhiṇī śatam apānudat ātma tantraḥ tvām duḥstham ūna padam ātmani pauruṣeṇa sampādayan yaduṣu ramyam abibhrat aṅgam	O personality of religion, I was greatly overburdened by the undue military phalanxes arranged by atheistic kings, and I was relieved by the grace of the Personality of Godhead. Similarly you were also in a distressed condition, weakened in your standing strength, and thus He also incarnated by His internal energy in the family of the Yadus to relieve you.
kā vā saheta viraham puruṣa uttamasya prema avaloka rucira smita valgu jalpaiḥ sthairyam sa mānam aharat madhu māninīnām roma utsavaḥ mama yat aṅghri viṭaṅkitāyāḥ	Who, therefore, can tolerate the pangs of separation from that Supreme Personality of Godhead? He could conquer the gravity and passionate wrath of His sweethearts like Satyabhāmā by His sweet smile of love, pleasing glance and hearty appeals. When He traversed my [earth’s] surface, I would be immersed in the dust of His lotus feet and thus would be sumptuously covered with grass which appeared like hairs standing on me out of pleasure.
tayoḥ evam kathayatoḥ pṛthivī dharmayoḥ tadā parīkṣit nāma rāja ṛṣiḥ prāptaḥ prācīm sarasvatīm	While the earth and the personality of religion were thus engaged in conversation, the saintly King Parīkṣit reached the shore of the Sarasvatī River, which flowed towards the east.
sūtaḥ uvāca tatra go mithunam rājā hanyamānam anātha vat daṇḍa hastam ca vṛṣalam dadṛśe nṛpa lāñchanam	Sūta Gosvāmī said: After reaching that place, Mahārāja Parīkṣit observed that a lower-caste śūdra, dressed like a king, was beating a cow and a bull with a club, as if they had no owner.
vṛṣam mṛṇāla dhavalam mehantam iva bibhyatam vepamānam padā ekena sīdantam śūdra tāḍitam	The bull was as white as a white lotus flower. He was terrified of the śūdra who was beating him, and he was so afraid that he was standing on one leg, trembling and urinating.
gām ca dharma dughām dīnām bhṛśam śūdra pada āhatām vivatsām āśru vadanām kṣāmām yavasam icchatīm	Although the cow is beneficial because one can draw religious principles from her, she was now rendered poor and calfless. Her legs were being beaten by a śūdra. There were tears in her eyes, and she was distressed and weak. She was hankering after some grass in the field.
papraccha ratham ārūḍhaḥ kārtasvara paricchadam megha gambhīrayā vācā samāropita kārmukaḥ	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, well equipped with arrows and bow and seated on a gold-embossed chariot, spoke to him [the śūdra] with a deep voice sounding like thunder.
kaḥ tvam mat śaraṇe loke balāt haṁsi abalān balī nara devaḥ asi veṣeṇa naṭa vat karmaṇā advi jaḥ	Oh, who are you? You appear to be strong and yet you dare kill, within my protection, those who are helpless! By your dress you pose yourself to be a godly man [king], but by your deeds you are opposing the principles of the twice-born kṣatriyas.
yaḥ tvam kṛṣṇe gate dūram saha gāṇḍīva dhanvanā śocyaḥ asi aśocyān rahasi praharan vadham arhasi	You rogue, do you dare beat an innocent cow because Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, the carrier of the Gāṇḍīva bow, are out of sight? Since you are beating the innocent in a secluded place, you are considered a culprit and therefore deserve to be killed.
tvam vā mṛṇāla dhavalaḥ pādaiḥ nyūnaḥ padā caran vṛṣa rūpeṇa kim kaścit devaḥ naḥ parikhedayan	Then he [Mahārāja Parīkṣit] asked the bull: Oh, who are you? Are you a bull as white as a white lotus, or are you a demigod? You have lost three of your legs and are moving on only one. Are you some demigod causing us grief in the form of a bull?
na jātu kaurava indrāṇām dordaṇḍa parirambhite bhū tale anupatanti asmin vinā te prāṇinām śucaḥ	Now for the first time in a kingdom well protected by the arms of the kings of the Kuru dynasty, I see you grieving with tears in your eyes. Up till now no one on earth has ever shed tears because of royal negligence.
mā saurabheya atra śucaḥ vyetu te vṛṣalāt bhayam mā rodīḥ amba bhadram te khalānām mayi śāstari	O son of Surabhi, you need lament no longer now. There is no need to fear this low-class śūdra. And, O mother cow, as long as I am living as the ruler and subduer of all envious men, there is no cause for you to cry. Everything will be good for you.
yasya rāṣṭre prajāḥ sarvāḥ trasyante sādhvi asādhubhiḥ tasya mattasya naśyanti kīrtiḥ āyuḥ bhagaḥ gatiḥ eṣaḥ rājñām paraḥ dharmaḥ hi ārtānām ārti nigrahaḥ ataḥ enam vadhiṣyāmi bhūta druham asat tamam	O chaste one, the king’s good name, duration of life and good rebirth vanish when all kinds of living beings are terrified by miscreants in his kingdom. It is certainly the prime duty of the king to subdue first the sufferings of those who suffer. Therefore I must kill this most wretched man because he is violent against other living beings.
kaḥ avṛścat tava pādān trīn saurabheya catuḥ pada mā bhūvan tvādṛśāḥ rāṣṭre rājñām kṛṣṇa anuvartinām	He [Mahārāja Parīkṣit] repeatedly addressed and questioned the bull thus: O son of Surabhi, who has cut off your three legs? In the state of the kings who are obedient to the laws of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, there is no one as unhappy as you.
ākhyāhi vṛṣa bhadram vaḥ sādhūnām akṛta āgasām ātma vairūpya kartāram pārthānām kīrti dūṣaṇam	O bull, you are offenseless and thoroughly honest; therefore I wish all good to you. Please tell me of the perpetrator of these mutilations, which blacken the reputation of the sons of Pṛthā.
jane anāgasi agham yuñjan sarvataḥ asya ca mat bhayam sādhūnām bhadram eva syāt asādhu damane kṛte	Whoever causes offenseless living beings to suffer must fear me anywhere and everywhere in the world. By curbing dishonest miscreants, one automatically benefits the offenseless.
anāgaḥsu iha bhūteṣu yaḥ āgaḥ kṛt niraṅkuśaḥ āhartā asmi bhujam sākṣāt amartyasya api sa aṅgadam	An upstart living being who commits offenses by torturing those who are offenseless shall be directly uprooted by me, even though he be a denizen of heaven with armor and decorations.
rājñaḥ hi paramaḥ dharmaḥ sva dharma stha anupālanam śāsataḥ anyān yathā śāstram anāpadi utpathān iha	The supreme duty of the ruling king is to give all protection to law-abiding persons and to chastise those who stray from the ordinances of the scriptures in ordinary times, when there is no emergency.
dharmaḥ uvāca etat vaḥ pāṇḍaveyānām yuktam ārta abhayam vacaḥ yeṣām guṇa gaṇaiḥ kṛṣṇaḥ dautya ādau bhagavān kṛtaḥ	The personality of religion said: These words just spoken by you befit a person of the Pāṇḍava dynasty. Captivated by the devotional qualities of the Pāṇḍavas, even Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, performed duties as a messenger.
na vayam kleśa bījāni yataḥ syuḥ puruṣa ṛṣabha puruṣam tam vijānīmaḥ vākya bheda vimohitāḥ	O greatest among human beings, it is very difficult to ascertain the particular miscreant who has caused our sufferings, because we are bewildered by all the different opinions of theoretical philosophers.
kecit vikalpa vasanāḥ āhuḥ ātmānam ātmanaḥ daivam anye apare karma svabhāvam apare prabhum	Some of the philosophers, who deny all sorts of duality, declare that one’s own self is responsible for his personal happiness and distress. Others say that superhuman powers are responsible, while yet others say that activity is responsible, and the gross materialists maintain that nature is the ultimate cause.
apratarkyāt anirdeśyāt iti keṣu api niścayaḥ atra anurūpam rāja ṛṣe vimṛśa sva manīṣayā	There are also some thinkers who believe that no one can ascertain the cause of distress by argumentation, nor know it by imagination, nor express it by words. O sage amongst kings, judge for yourself by thinking over all this with your own intelligence.
sūtaḥ uvāca evam dharme pravadati saḥ samrāṭ dvija sattamāḥ samāhitena manasā vikhedaḥ paryacaṣṭa tam	Sūta Gosvāmī said: O best among the brāhmaṇas, the Emperor Parīkṣit, thus hearing the personality of religion speak, was fully satisfied, and without mistake or regret he gave his reply.
rājā uvāca dharmam bravīṣi dharma jña dharmaḥ asi vṛṣa rūpa dhṛk yat adharma kṛtaḥ sthānam sūcakasya api tat bhavet	The King said: O you, who are in the form of a bull! You know the truth of religion, and you are speaking according to the principle that the destination intended for the perpetrator of irreligious acts is also intended for one who identifies the perpetrator. You are no other than the personality of religion.
athavā deva māyāyāḥ nūnam gatiḥ agocarā cetasaḥ vacasaḥ ca api bhūtānām iti niścayaḥ	Thus it is concluded that the Lord’s energies are inconceivable. No one can estimate them by mental speculation or by word jugglery.
tapaḥ śaucam dayā satyam iti pādāḥ kṛte kṛtāḥ adharma aṁśaiḥ trayaḥ bhagnāḥ smaya saṅga madaiḥ tava	In the age of Satya [truthfulness] your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women, and intoxication.
idānīm dharma pādaḥ te satyam nirvartayet yataḥ tam jighṛkṣati adharmaḥ ayam anṛtena edhitaḥ kaliḥ	You are now standing on one leg only, which is your truthfulness, and you are somehow or other hobbling along. But quarrel personified [Kali], flourishing by deceit, is also trying to destroy that leg.
iyam ca bhūmiḥ bhagavatā nyāsita uru bharā satī śrīmadbhiḥ tat pada nyāsaiḥ sarvataḥ kṛta kautukā	The burden of the earth was certainly diminished by the Personality of Godhead and by others as well. When He was present as an incarnation, all good was performed because of His auspicious footprints.
śocati aśru kalā sādhvī durbhagā iva ujjhitā satī abrahmaṇyāḥ nṛpa vyājāḥ śūdrāḥ bhokṣyanti mām iti	Now she, the chaste one, being unfortunately forsaken by the Personality of Godhead, laments her future with tears in her eyes, for now she is being ruled and enjoyed by lower-class men who pose as rulers.
iti dharmam mahīm ca eva sāntvayitvā mahā rathaḥ niśātam ādade khaḍgam kalaye adharma hetave	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, who could fight one thousand enemies single-handedly, thus pacified the personality of religion and the earth. Then he took up his sharp sword to kill the personality of Kali, who is the cause of all irreligion.
tam jighāṁsum abhipretya vihāya nṛpa lāñchanam tat pāda mūlam śirasā samagāt bhaya vihvalaḥ	When the personality of Kali understood that the King was willing to kill him, he at once abandoned the dress of a king and, under pressure of fear, completely surrendered to him, bowing his head.
patitam pādayoḥ vīraḥ kṛpayā dīna vatsalaḥ śaraṇyaḥ na avadhīt ślokyaḥ āha ca idam hasan iva	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, who was qualified to accept surrender and worthy of being sung in history, did not kill the poor surrendered and fallen Kali, but smiled compassionately, for he was kind to the poor.
rājā uvāca na te guḍākeśa yaśaḥ dharāṇām baddha añjaleḥ vai bhayam asti kiñcit na vartitavyam bhavatā kathañcana kṣetre madīye tvam adharma bandhuḥ	The King thus said: We have inherited the fame of Arjuna; therefore since you have surrendered yourself with folded hands you need not fear for your life. But you cannot remain in my kingdom, for you are the friend of irreligion.
tvām vartamānam nara deva deheṣu anupravṛttaḥ ayam adharma pūgaḥ lobhaḥ anṛtam cauryam anāryam aṁhaḥ jyeṣṭhā ca māyā kalahaḥ ca dambhaḥ	If the personality of Kali, irreligion, is allowed to act as a man-god or an executive head, certainly irreligious principles like greed, falsehood, robbery, incivility, treachery, misfortune, cheating, quarrel and vanity will abound.
na vartitavyam tat adharma bandho dharmeṇa satyena ca vartitavye brahma āvarte yatra yajanti yajñaiḥ yajña īśvaram yajña vitāna vijñāḥ	Therefore, O friend of irreligion, you do not deserve to remain in a place where experts perform sacrifices according to truth and religious principles for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
yasmin hariḥ bhagavān ijyamānaḥ ijya ātma mūrtiḥ yajatām śam tanoti kāmān amoghān sthira jaṅgamānām antaḥ bahiḥ vāyuḥ iva eṣaḥ ātmā	In all sacrificial ceremonies, although sometimes a demigod is worshiped, the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is worshiped because He is the Supersoul of everyone, and exists both inside and outside like the air. Thus it is He only who awards all welfare to the worshiper.
sūtaḥ uvāca parīkṣitā evam ādiṣṭaḥ saḥ kaliḥ jāta vepathuḥ tam udyata asim āha idam daṇḍa pāṇim iva udyatam	Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: The personality of Kali, thus being ordered by Mahārāja Parīkṣit, began to tremble in fear. Seeing the King before him like Yamarāja, ready to kill him, Kali spoke to the King as follows.
kaliḥ uvāca yatra kva vā atha vatsyāmi sārva bhauma tava ājñayā lakṣaye tatra tatra api tvām ātta iṣu śarāsanam	O Your Majesty, though I may live anywhere and everywhere under your order, I shall but see you with bow and arrows wherever I look.
tat me dharma bhṛtām śreṣṭha sthānam nirdeṣṭum arhasi yatra eva niyataḥ vatsye ātiṣṭhan te anuśāsanam	Therefore, O chief amongst the protectors of religion, please fix some place for me where I can live permanently under the protection of your government.
sūtaḥ uvāca abhyarthitaḥ tadā tasmai sthānāni kalaye dadau dyūtam pānam striyaḥ sūnā yatra adharmaḥ catuḥ vidhaḥ	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Mahārāja Parīkṣit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed.
punaḥ ca yācamānāya jāta rūpam adāt prabhuḥ tataḥ anṛtam madam kāmam rajaḥ vairam ca pañcamam	The personality of Kali asked for something more, and because of his begging, the King gave him permission to live where there is gold because wherever there is gold there is also falsity, intoxication, lust, envy and enmity.
amūni pañca sthānāni hi adharma prabhavaḥ kaliḥ auttareyeṇa dattāni nyavasat tat nideśa kṛt	Thus the personality of Kali, by the directions of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the son of Uttarā, was allowed to live in those five places.
atha etāni na seveta bubhūṣuḥ puruṣaḥ kvacit viśeṣataḥ dharma śīlaḥ rājā loka patiḥ guruḥ	Therefore, whoever desires progressive well-being, especially kings, religionists, public leaders, brāhmaṇas and sannyāsīs, should never come in contact with the four above-mentioned irreligious principles.
vṛṣasya naṣṭān trīn pādān tapaḥ śaucam dayām iti pratisandadhe āśvāsya mahīm ca samavardhayat	Thereafter the King reestablished the lost legs of the personality of religion [the bull], and by encouraging activities he sufficiently improved the condition of the earth.
saḥ eṣaḥ etarhi adhyāste āsanam pārthiva ucitam pitāmahena upanyastam rājñā araṇyam vivikṣatā āste adhunā saḥ rāja ṛṣiḥ kaurava indra śriyā ullasan gajāhvaye mahā bhāgaḥ cakravartī bṛhat śravāḥ	The most fortunate emperor Mahārāja Parīkṣit, who was entrusted with the kingdom of Hastināpura by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira when he desired to retire to the forest, is now ruling the world with great success due to his being glorified by the deeds of the kings of the Kuru dynasty.
ittham bhūta anubhāvaḥ ayam abhimanyu sutaḥ nṛpaḥ yasya pālayataḥ kṣauṇīm yūyam satrāya dīkṣitāḥ	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the son of Abhimanyu, is so experienced that by dint of his expert administration and patronage, it has been possible for you to perform a sacrifice such as this.
sūtaḥ uvāca yaḥ vai drauṇi astra vipluṣṭaḥ na mātuḥ udare mṛtaḥ anugrahāt bhagavataḥ kṛṣṇasya adbhuta karmaṇaḥ	Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: Due to the mercy of the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who acts wonderfully, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, though struck by the weapon of the son of Droṇa in his mother’s womb, could not be burned.
brahma kopa utthitāt yaḥ tu takṣakāt prāṇa viplavāt na sammumoha uru bhayāt bhagavati arpita āśayaḥ	Furthermore, Mahārāja Parīkṣit was always consciously surrendered to the Personality of Godhead, and therefore he was neither afraid nor overwhelmed by fear due to a snake-bird which was to bite him because of the fury of a brāhmaṇa boy.
utsṛjya sarvataḥ saṅgam vijñāta ajita saṁsthitiḥ vaiyāsakeḥ jahau śiṣyaḥ gaṅgāyām svam kalevaram	Furthermore, after leaving all his associates, the King surrendered himself as a disciple to the son of Vyāsa [Śukadeva Gosvāmī], and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the Personality of Godhead, and at last gave up his material body on the bank of the Ganges.
na uttama śloka vārtānām juṣatām tat kathā amṛtam syāt sambhramaḥ anta kāle api smaratām tat pada ambujam	This was so because those who have dedicated their lives to the transcendental topics of the Personality of Godhead, of whom the Vedic hymns sing, and who are constantly engaged in remembering the lotus feet of the Lord, do not run the risk of having misconceptions even at the last moment of their lives.
tāvat kaliḥ na prabhavet praviṣṭaḥ api iha sarvataḥ yāvat īśaḥ mahān urvyām ābhimanyavaḥ eka rāṭ	As long as the great, powerful son of Abhimanyu remains the Emperor of the world, there is no chance that the personality of Kali will flourish.
yasmin ahani yarhi eva bhagavān utsasarja gām tadā eva iha anuvṛttaḥ asau adharma prabhavaḥ kaliḥ	The very day and moment the Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, left this earth, the personality of Kali, who promotes all kinds of irreligious activities, came into this world.
na anudveṣṭi kalim samrāṭ sāram ga iva sāra bhuk kuśalāni āśu siddhyanti na itarāṇi kṛtāni yat	Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a realist, like the bees who only accept the essence [of a flower]. He knew perfectly well that in this Age of Kali, auspicious things produce good effects immediately, whereas inauspicious acts must be actually performed [to render effects]. So he was never envious of the personality of Kali.
kim nu bāleṣu śūreṇa kalinā dhīra bhīruṇā apramattaḥ pramatteṣu yaḥ vṛkaḥ nṛṣu vartate	Mahārāja Parīkṣit considered that less intelligent men might find the personality of Kali to be very powerful, but that those who are self-controlled would have nothing to fear. The King was powerful like a tiger and took care for the foolish, careless persons.
upavarṇitam etat vaḥ puṇyam pārīkṣitam mayā vāsudeva kathā upetam ākhyānam yat apṛcchata	O sages, as you did ask me, now I have described almost everything regarding the narrations about Lord Kṛṣṇa in connection with the history of the pious Mahārāja Parīkṣit.
yāḥ yāḥ kathāḥ bhagavataḥ kathanīya uru karmaṇaḥ guṇa karma āśrayāḥ pumbhiḥ saṁsevyāḥ tāḥ bubhūṣubhiḥ	Those who are desirous of achieving complete perfection in life must submissively hear all topics that are connected with the transcendental activities and qualities of the Personality of Godhead, who acts wonderfully.
ṛṣayaḥ ūcuḥ sūta jīva samāḥ saumya śāśvatīḥ viśadam yaśaḥ yaḥ tvam śaṁsasi kṛṣṇasya martyānām amṛtam hi naḥ	The good sages said: O grave Sūta Gosvāmī! May you live many years and have eternal fame, for you are speaking very nicely about the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. This is just like nectar for mortal beings like us.
karmaṇi asmin anāśvāse dhūma dhūmra ātmanām bhavān āpāyayati govinda pāda padma āsavam madhu	We have just begun the performance of this fruitive activity, a sacrificial fire, without certainty of its result due to the many imperfections in our action. Our bodies have become black from the smoke, but we are factually pleased by the nectar of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Govinda, which you are distributing.
tulayāma lavena api na svargam na apunaḥ bhavam bhagavat saṅgi saṅgasya martyānām kim uta āśiṣaḥ	The value of a moment’s association with the devotee of the Lord cannot even be compared to the attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity, which are for those who are meant for death.
kaḥ nāma tṛpyet rasa vit kathāyām mahat tama ekānta parāyaṇasya na antam guṇānām aguṇasya jagmuḥ yoga īśvarāḥ ye bhava pādma mukhyāḥ	The Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa [Govinda], is the exclusive shelter for all great living beings, and His transcendental attributes cannot even be measured by such masters of mystic powers as Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar [rasa] ever be fully satiated by hearing topics about Him?
tat naḥ bhavān vai bhagavat pradhānaḥ mahat tama ekānta parāyaṇasya hareḥ udāram caritam viśuddham śuśrūṣatām naḥ vitanotu vidvan	O Sūta Gosvāmī, you are a learned and pure devotee of the Lord because the Personality of Godhead is your chief object of service. Therefore please describe to us the pastimes of the Lord, which are above all material conception, for we are anxious to receive such messages.
saḥ vai mahā bhāgavataḥ parīkṣit yena apavarga ākhyam adabhra buddhiḥ jñānena vaiyāsaki śabditena bheje khaga indra dhvaja pāda mūlam	O Sūta Gosvāmī, please describe those topics of the Lord by which Mahārāja Parīkṣit, whose intelligence was fixed on liberation, attained the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of Garuḍa, the king of birds. Those topics were vibrated by the son of Vyāsa [Śrīla Śukadeva].
tat naḥ param puṇyam asaṁvṛta artham ākhyānam ati adbhuta yoga niṣṭham ākhyāhi ananta ācarita upapannam pārīkṣitam bhāgavata abhirāmam	Thus please narrate to us the narrations of the Unlimited, for they are purifying and supreme. They were spoken to Mahārāja Parīkṣit, and they are very dear to the pure devotees, being full of bhakti-yoga.
sūtaḥ uvāca aho vayam janma bhṛtaḥ adya ha āsma vṛddha anuvṛttyā api viloma jātāḥ dauṣkulyam ādhim vidhunoti śīghram mahat tamānām abhidhāna yogaḥ	Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: O God, although we are born in a mixed caste, we are still promoted in birthright simply by serving and following the great who are advanced in knowledge. Even by conversing with such great souls, one can without delay cleanse oneself of all disqualifications resulting from lower births.
kutaḥ punaḥ gṛṇataḥ nāma tasya mahat tama ekānta parāyaṇasya yaḥ ananta śaktiḥ bhagavān anantaḥ mahat guṇatvāt yam anantam āhuḥ	And what to speak of those who are under the direction of the great devotees, chanting the holy name of the Unlimited, who has unlimited potency? The Personality of Godhead, unlimited in potency and transcendental by attributes, is called Ananta [Unlimited].
etāvatā alam nanu sūcitena guṇaiḥ asāmya anati śāyanasya hitvā itarān prārthayataḥ vibhūtiḥ yasya aṅghri reṇum juṣate anabhīpsoḥ	It is now ascertained that He [the Personality of Godhead] is unlimited and there is none equal to Him. Consequently no one can speak of Him adequately. Great demigods cannot obtain the favor of the goddess of fortune even by prayers, but this very goddess renders service unto the Lord, although He is unwilling to have such service.
atha api yat pāda nakha avasṛṣṭam jagat viriñca upahṛta arhaṇa ambhaḥ sa īśam punāti anyatamaḥ mukundāt kaḥ nāma loke bhagavat pada arthaḥ	Who can be worthy of the name of the Supreme Lord but the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa? Brahmājī collected the water emanating from the nails of His feet in order to award it to Lord Śiva as a worshipful welcome. This very water [the Ganges] is purifying the whole universe, including Lord Śiva.
yatra anuraktāḥ sahasā eva dhīrāḥ vyapohya deha ādiṣu saṅgam ūḍham vrajanti tat pārama haṁsyam antyam yasmin ahiṁsā upaśamaḥ sva dharmaḥ	Self-controlled persons who are attached to the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa can all of a sudden give up the world of material attachment, including the gross body and subtle mind, and go away to attain the highest perfection of the renounced order of life, by which nonviolence and renunciation are consequential.
aham hi pṛṣṭaḥ aryamaṇaḥ bhavadbhiḥ ācakṣe ātma avagamaḥ atra yāvān nabhaḥ patanti ātma samam patattriṇaḥ tathā samam viṣṇu gatim vipaścitaḥ	O ṛṣis, who are as powerfully pure as the sun, I shall try to describe to you the transcendental pastimes of Viṣṇu as far as my knowledge is concerned. As the birds fly in the sky as far as their capacity allows, so do the learned devotees describe the Lord as far as their realization allows.
ekadā dhanuḥ udyamya vicaran mṛgayām vane mṛgān anugataḥ śrāntaḥ kṣudhitaḥ tṛṣitaḥ bhṛśam jala āśayam acakṣāṇaḥ praviveśa tam āśramam dadarśa munim āsīnam śāntam mīlita locanam	Once upon a time Mahārāja Parīkṣit, while engaged in hunting in the forest with bow and arrows, became extremely fatigued, hungry and thirsty while following the stags. While searching for a reservoir of water, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Śamīka Ṛṣi and saw the sage sitting silently with closed eyes.
pratiruddha indriya prāṇa manaḥ buddhim upāratam sthāna trayāt param prāptam brahma bhūtam avikriyam	The muni’s sense organs, breath, mind and intelligence were all restrained from material activities, and he was situated in a trance apart from the three [wakefulness, dream and unconsciousness], having achieved a transcendental position qualitatively equal with the Supreme Absolute.
viprakīrṇa jaṭa ācchannam rauraveṇa ajinena ca viśuṣyat tāluḥ udakam tathā bhūtam ayācata	The sage, in meditation, was covered by the skin of a stag, and long, compressed hair was scattered all over him. The King, whose palate was dry from thirst, asked him for water.
alabdha tṛṇa bhūmi ādiḥ asamprāpta arghya sūnṛtaḥ avajñātam iva ātmānam manyamānaḥ cukopa ha	The King, not received by any formal welcome by means of being offered a seat, place, water and sweet addresses, considered himself neglected, and so thinking he became angry.
abhūta pūrvaḥ sahasā kṣut tṛḍbhyām ardita ātmanaḥ brāhmaṇam prati abhūt brahman matsaraḥ manyuḥ eva ca	O brāhmaṇas, the circumstances having distressed him with extreme hunger and thirst, the King directed toward the sage his anger and envy, which he had never before directed toward a brāhmaṇa.
saḥ tu brahma ṛṣeḥ aṁse gata asum uragam ruṣā vinirgacchan dhanuḥ koṭyā nidhāya puram āgataḥ	While leaving, the King, being so insulted, picked up a lifeless snake with his bow and angrily placed it on the shoulder of the sage. Then he returned to his palace.
eṣaḥ kim nibhṛta aśeṣa karaṇaḥ mīlita īkṣaṇaḥ mṛṣā samādhiḥ āho svit kim nu syāt kṣatra bandhubhiḥ	Upon returning, he began to contemplate and argue within himself whether the sage had actually been in meditation, with senses concentrated and eyes closed, or whether he had just been feigning trance just to avoid receiving a lower kṣatriya.
tasya putraḥ ati tejasvī viharan bālakaḥ arbhakaiḥ rājñā agham prāpitam tātam śrutvā tatra idam abravīt	The sage had a son who was very powerful, being a brāhmaṇa’s son. While he was playing with inexperienced boys, he heard of his father’s distress, which was occasioned by the King. Then and there the boy spoke as follows.
aho adharmaḥ pālānām pīvnām bali bhujām iva svāmini agham yat dāsānām dvāra pānām śunām iva	[The brāhmaṇa’s son, Śṛṅgi, said:] O just look at the sins of the rulers who, like crows and watchdogs at the door, perpetrate sins against their masters, contrary to the principles governing servants.
brāhmaṇaiḥ kṣatra bandhuḥ hi gṛha pālaḥ nirūpitaḥ saḥ katham tat gṛhe dvāḥ sthaḥ sa bhāṇḍam bhoktum arhati	The descendants of the kingly orders are definitely designated as watchdogs, and they must keep themselves at the door. On what grounds can dogs enter the house and claim to dine with the master on the same plate?
kṛṣṇe gate bhagavati śāstari utpatha gāminām tat bhinna setūn adya aham śāsmi paśyata me balam	After the departure of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead and supreme ruler of everyone, these upstarts have flourished, our protector being gone. Therefore I myself shall take up this matter and punish them. Just witness my power.
iti uktvā roṣa tāmra akṣaḥ vayasyān ṛṣi bālakaḥ kauśikī āpaḥ upaspṛśya vāk vajram visasarja ha	The son of the ṛṣi, his eyes red-hot with anger, touched the water of the River Kauśika while speaking to his playmates and discharged the following thunderbolt of words.
iti laṅghita maryādam takṣakaḥ saptame ahani daṅkṣyati sma kula aṅgāram coditaḥ me tata druham	The brāhmaṇa’s son cursed the King thus: On the seventh day from today a snake-bird will bite the most wretched one of that dynasty [Mahārāja Parīkṣit] because of his having broken the laws of etiquette by insulting my father.
tataḥ abhyetya āśramam bālaḥ gale sarpa kalevaram pitaram vīkṣya duḥkha ārtaḥ mukta kaṇṭhaḥ ruroda ha	Thereafter, when the boy returned to the hermitage, he saw a snake on his father’s shoulder, and out of his grief he cried very loudly.
saḥ vai āṅgirasaḥ brahman śrutvā suta vilāpanam unmīlya śanakaiḥ netre dṛṣṭvā ca aṁse mṛta uragam	O brāhmaṇas, the ṛṣi, who was born in the family of Aṅgirā Muni, hearing his son crying, gradually opened his eyes and saw the dead snake around his neck.
visṛjya tam ca papraccha vatsa kasmāt hi rodiṣi kena vā te apakṛtam iti uktaḥ saḥ nyavedayat	He threw the dead snake aside and asked his son why he was crying, whether anyone had done him harm. On hearing this, the son explained to him what had happened.
niśamya śaptam atat arham nara indram saḥ brāhmaṇaḥ na ātma jam abhyanandat aho bata aṁhaḥ mahat adya te kṛtam alpīyasi drohe uruḥ damaḥ dhṛtaḥ	The father heard from his son that the King had been cursed, although he should never have been condemned, for he was the best amongst all human beings. The ṛṣi did not congratulate his son, but, on the contrary, began to repent, saying: Alas! What a great sinful act was performed by my son. He has awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense.
na vai nṛbhiḥ nara devam para ākhyam sammātum arhasi avipakva buddhe yat tejasā durviṣaheṇa guptāḥ vindanti bhadrāṇi akutaḥ bhayāḥ prajāḥ	O my boy, your intelligence is immature, and therefore you have no knowledge that the king, who is the best amongst human beings, is as good as the Personality of Godhead. He is never to be placed on an equal footing with common men. The citizens of the state live in prosperity, being protected by his unsurpassable prowess.
alakṣyamāṇe nara deva nāmni ratha aṅga pāṇau ayam aṅga lokaḥ tadā hi caura pracuraḥ vinaṅkṣyati arakṣyamāṇaḥ avivarūtha vat kṣaṇāt	My dear boy, the Lord, who carries the wheel of a chariot, is represented by the monarchical regime, and when this regime is abolished the whole world becomes filled with thieves, who then at once vanquish the unprotected subjects like scattered lambs.
tat adya naḥ pāpam upaiti ananvayam yat naṣṭa nāthasya vasoḥ vilumpakāt parasparam ghnanti śapanti vṛñjate paśūn striyaḥ arthān puru dasyavaḥ janāḥ	Due to the termination of the monarchical regimes and the plundering of the people’s wealth by rogues and thieves, there will be great social disruptions. People will be killed and injured, and animals and women will be stolen. And for all these sins we shall be responsible.
tadā ārya dharmaḥ pravilīyate nṛṇām varṇa āśrama ācāra yutaḥ trayī mayaḥ tataḥ artha kāma abhiniveśita ātmanām śunām kapīnām iva varṇa saṅkaraḥ	At that time the people in general will fall systematically from the path of a progressive civilization in respect to the qualitative engagements of the castes and the orders of society and the Vedic injunctions. Thus they will be more attracted to economic development for sense gratification, and as a result there will be an unwanted population on the level of dogs and monkeys.
dharma pālaḥ nara patiḥ saḥ tu samrāṭ bṛhat śravāḥ sākṣāt mahā bhāgavataḥ rāja ṛṣiḥ haya medhayāṭ kṣut tṛṭ śrama yutaḥ dīnaḥ na eva asmat śāpam arhati	The Emperor Parīkṣit is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is a first-class devotee of the Personality of Godhead. He is a saint amongst royalty, and he has performed many horse sacrifices. When such a king is tired and fatigued, being stricken with hunger and thirst, he does not at all deserve to be cursed.
apāpeṣu sva bhṛtyeṣu bālena apakva buddhinā pāpam kṛtam tat bhagavān sarva ātmā kṣantum arhati	Then the ṛṣi prayed to the all-pervading Personality of Godhead to pardon his immature boy, who had no intelligence and who committed the great sin of cursing a person who was completely free from all sins, who was subordinate and who deserved to be protected.
tiraḥ kṛtāḥ vipralabdhāḥ śaptāḥ kṣiptāḥ hatāḥ api na asya tat pratikurvanti tat bhaktāḥ prabhavaḥ api hi	The devotees of the Lord are so forbearing that even though they are defamed, cheated, cursed, disturbed, neglected or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves.
iti putra kṛta aghena saḥ anutaptaḥ mahā muniḥ svayam viprakṛtaḥ rājñā na eva agham tat acintayat	The sage thus regretted the sin committed by his own son. He did not take the insult paid by the King very seriously.
prāyaśaḥ sādhavaḥ loke paraiḥ dvandveṣu yojitāḥ na vyathanti na hṛṣyanti yataḥ ātmā aguṇa āśrayaḥ	Generally the transcendentalists, even though engaged by others in the dualities of the material world, are not distressed. Nor do they take pleasure [in worldly things], for they are transcendentally engaged.
sūtaḥ uvāca mahī patiḥ tu atha tat karma garhyam vicintayan ātma kṛtam su durmanāḥ aho mayā nīcam anārya vat kṛtam nirāgasi brahmaṇi gūḍha tejasi	Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: While returning home, the King [Mahārāja Parīkṣit] felt that the act he had committed against the faultless and powerful brāhmaṇa was heinous and uncivilized. Consequently he was distressed.
dhruvam tataḥ me kṛta deva helanāt duratyayam vyasanam na ati dīrghāt tat astu kāmam hi agha niṣkṛtāya me yathā na kuryām punaḥ evam addhā	[King Parīkṣit thought:] Due to my neglecting the injunctions of the Supreme Lord I must certainly expect some difficulty to overcome me in the near future. I now desire without reservation that the calamity come now, for in this way I may be freed of the sinful action and not commit such an offense again.
adya eva rājyam balam ṛddha kośam prakopita brahma kula analaḥ me dahatu abhadrasya punaḥ na me abhūt pāpīyasī dhīḥ dvija deva gobhyaḥ	I am uncivilized and sinful due to my neglect of brahminical culture, God consciousness and cow protection. Therefore I wish that my kingdom, strength and riches burn up immediately by the fire of the brāhmaṇa’s wrath so that in the future I may not be guided by such inauspicious attitudes.
saḥ cintayan ittham atha aśṛṇot yathā muneḥ suta uktaḥ nirṛtiḥ takṣaka ākhyaḥ saḥ sādhu mene na cireṇa takṣaka analam prasaktasya virakti kāraṇam	While the King was thus repenting, he received news of his imminent death, which would be due to the bite of a snake-bird, occasioned by the curse spoken by the sage’s son. The King accepted this as good news, for it would be the cause of his indifference toward worldly things.
atho vihāya imam amum ca lokam vimarśitau heyatayā purastāt kṛṣṇa aṅghri sevām adhimanyamānaḥ upāviśat prāyam amartya nadyām	Mahārāja Parīkṣit sat down firmly on the banks of the Ganges to concentrate his mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, rejecting all other practices of self-realization, because transcendental loving service to Kṛṣṇa is the greatest achievement, superseding all other methods.
yā vai lasat śrī tulasī vimiśra kṛṣṇa aṅghri reṇu abhyadhika ambu netrī punāti lokān ubhayatra sa īśān kaḥ tām na seveta mariṣyamāṇaḥ	The river [by which the King sat to fast] carries the most auspicious water, which is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord and tulasī leaves. Therefore that water sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside and even sanctifies Lord Śiva and other demigods. Consequently everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.
iti vyavacchidya saḥ pāṇḍaveyaḥ prāya upaveśam prati viṣṇu padyām dadhau mukunda aṅghrim ananya bhāvaḥ muni vrataḥ mukta samasta saṅgaḥ	Thus the King, the worthy descendant of the Pāṇḍavas, decided once and for all and sat on the Ganges’ bank to fast until death and give himself up to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who alone is able to award liberation. So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attachments, he accepted the vows of a sage.
tatra upajagmuḥ bhuvanam punānāḥ mahā anubhāvāḥ munayaḥ sa śiṣyāḥ prāyeṇa tīrtha abhigama apadeśaiḥ svayam hi tīrthāni punanti santaḥ	At that time all the great minds and thinkers, accompanied by their disciples, and sages who could verily sanctify a place of pilgrimage just by their presence, arrived there on the plea of making a pilgrim’s journey.
atriḥ to nāradaḥ	From different parts of the universe there arrived great sages like Atri, Cyavana, Śaradvān, Ariṣṭanemi, Bhṛgu, Vasiṣṭha, Parāśara, Viśvāmitra, Aṅgirā, Paraśurāma, Utathya, Indrapramada, Idhmavāhu, Medhātithi, Devala, Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, Bhāradvāja, Gautama, Pippalāda, Maitreya, Aurva, Kavaṣa, Kumbhayoni, Dvaipāyana and the great personality Nārada.
anye ca devarṣi brahmarṣi varyāḥ rājarṣi varyāḥ aruṇa ādayaḥ ca nānā ārṣeya pravarān sametān abhyarcya rājā śirasā vavande	There were also many other saintly demigods, kings and special royal orders called aruṇādayas [a special rank of rājarṣis] from different dynasties of sages. When they all assembled together to meet the Emperor [Parīkṣit], he received them properly and bowed his head to the ground.
sukha upaviṣṭeṣu atha teṣu bhūyaḥ kṛta praṇāmaḥ sva cikīrṣitam yat vijñāpayām āsa vivikta cetāḥ upasthitaḥ agre abhigṛhīta pāṇiḥ	After all the ṛṣis and others had seated themselves comfortably, the King, humbly standing before them with folded hands, told them of his decision to fast until death.
rājā uvāca aho vayam dhanya tamāḥ nṛpāṇām mahat tama anugrahaṇīya śīlāḥ rājñām kulam brāhmaṇa pāda śaucāt dūrāt visṛṣṭam bata garhya karma	The fortunate King said: Indeed, we are the most grateful of all the kings who are trained to get favors from the great souls. Generally you [sages] consider royalty as refuse to be rejected and left in a distant place.
tasya eva me aghasya parā avara īśaḥ vyāsakta cittasya gṛheṣu abhīkṣṇam nirveda mūlaḥ dvija śāpa rūpaḥ yatra prasaktaḥ bhayam āśu dhatte	The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the controller of both the transcendental and mundane worlds, has graciously overtaken me in the form of a brāhmaṇa’s curse. Due to my being too much attached to family life, the Lord, in order to save me, has appeared before me in such a way that only out of fear I will detach myself from the world.
tam mā upayātam pratiyantu viprāḥ gaṅgā ca devī dhṛta cittam īśe dvija upasṛṣṭaḥ kuhakaḥ takṣakaḥ vā daśatu alam gāyata viṣṇu gāthāḥ	O brāhmaṇas, just accept me as a completely surrendered soul, and let mother Ganges, the representative of the Lord, also accept me in that way, for I have already taken the lotus feet of the Lord into my heart. Let the snake-bird — or whatever magical thing the brāhmaṇa created — bite me at once. I only desire that you all continue singing the deeds of Lord Viṣṇu.
punaḥ ca bhūyāt bhagavati anante ratiḥ prasaṅgaḥ ca tat āśrayeṣu mahatsu yām yām upayāmi sṛṣṭim maitrī astu sarvatra namaḥ dvijebhyaḥ	Again, offering obeisances unto all you brāhmaṇas, I pray that if I should again take my birth in the material world I will have complete attachment to the unlimited Lord Kṛṣṇa, association with His devotees and friendly relations with all living beings.
iti sma rājā adhyavasāya yuktaḥ prācīna mūleṣu kuśeṣu dhīraḥ udaṅ mukhaḥ dakṣiṇa kūle āste samudra patnyāḥ sva suta nyasta bhāraḥ	In perfect self-control, Mahārāja Parīkṣit sat down on a seat of straw, with straw-roots facing the east, placed on the southern bank of the Ganges, and he himself faced the north. Just previously he had given charge of his kingdom over to his son.
evam ca tasmin nara deva deve prāya upaviṣṭe divi deva saṅghāḥ praśasya bhūmau vyakiran prasūnaiḥ mudā muhuḥ dundubhayaḥ ca neduḥ	Thus the King, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, sat to fast until death. All the demigods of the higher planets praised the King’s actions and in pleasure continually scattered flowers over the earth and beat celestial drums.
maharṣayaḥ vai samupāgatāḥ ye praśasya sādhu iti anumodamānāḥ ūcuḥ prajā anugraha śīla sārāḥ yat uttama śloka guṇa abhirūpam	All the great sages who were assembled there also praised the decision of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, and they expressed their approval by saying “Very good.” Naturally the sages are inclined to do good to common men, for they have all the qualitative powers of the Supreme Lord. Therefore they were very much pleased to see Mahārāja Parīkṣit, a devotee of the Lord, and they spoke as follows.
na vā idam rājarṣi varya citram bhavatsu kṛṣṇam samanuvrateṣu ye adhyāsanam rāja kirīṭa juṣṭam sadyaḥ jahuḥ bhagavat pārśva kāmāḥ	[The sages said:] O chief of all the saintly kings of the Pāṇḍu dynasty who are strictly in the line of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa! It is not at all astonishing that you give up your throne, which is decorated with the helmets of many kings, to achieve eternal association with the Personality of Godhead.
sarve vayam tāvat iha āsmahe atha kalevaram yāvat asau vihāya lokam param virajaskam viśokam yāsyati ayam bhāgavata pradhānaḥ	We shall all wait here until the foremost devotee of the Lord, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, returns to the supreme planet, which is completely free from all mundane contamination and all kinds of lamentation.
āśrutya tat ṛṣi gaṇa vacaḥ parīkṣit samam madhu cyut guru ca avyalīkam ābhāṣata enān abhinandya yuktān śuśrūṣamāṇaḥ caritāni viṣṇoḥ	All that was spoken by the great sages was very sweet to hear, full of meaning and appropriately presented as perfectly true. So after hearing them, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, desiring to hear of the activities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, congratulated the great sages.
samāgatāḥ sarvataḥ eva sarve vedāḥ yathā mūrti dharāḥ tri pṛṣṭhe na iha atha na amutra ca kaścana arthaḥ ṛte para anugraham ātma śīlam	The King said: O great sages, you have all very kindly assembled here, having come from all parts of the universe. You are all as good as supreme knowledge personified, who resides in the planet above the three worlds [Satyaloka]. Consequently you are naturally inclined to do good to others, and but for this you have no interest, either in this life or in the next.
tataḥ ca vaḥ pṛcchyam imam vipṛcche viśrabhya viprāḥ iti kṛtyatāyām sarva ātmanā mriyamāṇaiḥ ca kṛtyam śuddham ca tatra āmṛśata abhiyuktāḥ	O trustworthy brāhmaṇas, I now ask you about my immediate duty. Please, after proper deliberation, tell me of the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances, and specifically of those who are just about to die.
tatra abhavat bhagavān vyāsa putraḥ yadṛcchayā gām aṭamānaḥ anapekṣaḥ alakṣya liṅgaḥ nija lābha tuṣṭaḥ vṛtaḥ ca bālaiḥ avadhūta veṣaḥ	At that moment there appeared the powerful son of Vyāsadeva, who traveled over the earth disinterested and satisfied with himself. He did not manifest any symptoms of belonging to any social order or status of life. He was surrounded with women and children, and he dressed as if others had neglected him.
tam dvi aṣṭa varṣam su kumāra pāda kara ūru bāhu aṁsa kapola gātram cāru āyata akṣa unnasa tulya karṇa subhru ānanam kambu sujāta kaṇṭham	This son of Vyāsadeva was only sixteen years old. His legs, hands, thighs, arms, shoulders, forehead and the other parts of his body were all delicately formed. His eyes were beautifully wide, and his nose and ears were highly raised. He had a very attractive face, and his neck was well formed and beautiful like a conchshell.
nigūḍha jatrum pṛthu tuṅga vakṣasam āvarta nābhim vali valgu udaram ca dik ambaram vaktra vikīrṇa keśam pralamba bāhum su amara uttama ābham	His collarbone was fleshy, his chest broad and thick, his navel deep and his abdomen beautifully striped. His arms were long, and curly hair was strewn over his beautiful face. He was naked, and the hue of his body reflected that of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
śyāmam sadā apīvya vayaḥ aṅga lakṣmyā strīṇām manaḥ jñam rucira smitena pratyutthitāḥ te munayaḥ sva āsanebhyaḥ tat lakṣaṇa jñāḥ api gūḍha varcasam	He was blackish and very beautiful due to his youth. Because of the glamor of his body and his attractive smiles, he was pleasing to women. Though he tried to cover his natural glories, the great sages present there were all expert in the art of physiognomy, and so they honored him by rising from their seats.
saḥ viṣṇu rātaḥ atithaye āgatāya tasmai saparyām śirasā ājahāra tataḥ nivṛttāḥ hi abudhāḥ striyaḥ arbhakāḥ mahā āsane sa upaviveśa pūjitaḥ	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, who is also known as Viṣṇurāta [one who is always protected by Viṣṇu], bowed his head to receive the chief guest, Śukadeva Gosvāmī. At that time all the ignorant women and boys ceased following Śrīla Śukadeva. Receiving respect from all, Śukadeva Gosvāmī took his exalted seat.
saḥ saṁvṛtaḥ tatra mahān mahīyasām brahmarṣi rājarṣi devarṣi saṅghaiḥ vyarocata alam bhagavān yathā induḥ graha ṛkṣa tārā nikaraiḥ parītaḥ	Śukadeva Gosvāmī was then surrounded by saintly sages and demigods just as the moon is surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. His presence was gorgeous, and he was respected by all.
praśāntam āsīnam akuṇṭha medhasam munim nṛpaḥ bhāgavataḥ abhyupetya praṇamya mūrdhnā avahitaḥ kṛta añjaliḥ natvā girā sūnṛtayā anvapṛcchat	The sage Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī sat perfectly pacified, intelligent and ready to answer any question without hesitation. The great devotee, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, approached him, offered his respects by bowing before him, and politely inquired with sweet words and folded hands.
parīkṣit uvāca aho adya vayam brahman sat sevyāḥ kṣatra bandhavaḥ kṛpayā atithi rūpeṇa bhavadbhiḥ tīrthakāḥ kṛtāḥ	The fortunate King Parīkṣit said: O brāhmaṇa, by your mercy only, you have sanctified us, making us like unto places of pilgrimage, all by your presence here as my guest. By your mercy, we, who are but unworthy royalty, become eligible to serve the devotee.
yeṣām saṁsmaraṇāt puṁsām sadyaḥ śuddhyanti vai gṛhāḥ kim punaḥ darśana sparśa pāda śauca āsana ādibhiḥ	Simply by our remembering you, our houses become instantly sanctified. And what to speak of seeing you, touching you, washing your holy feet and offering you a seat in our home?
sānnidhyāt te mahā yogin pātakāni mahānti api sadyaḥ naśyanti vai puṁsām viṣṇoḥ iva sura itarāḥ	Just as the atheist cannot remain in the presence of the Personality of Godhead, so also the invulnerable sins of a man are immediately vanquished in your presence, O saint! O great mystic!
api me bhagavān prītaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ pāṇḍu suta priyaḥ paitṛ svaseya prīti artham tat gotrasya ātta bāndhavaḥ	Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is very dear to the sons of King Pāṇḍu, has accepted me as one of those relatives just to please His great cousins and brothers.
anyathā te avyakta gateḥ darśanam naḥ katham nṛṇām nitarām mriyamāṇānām saṁsiddhasya vanīyasaḥ	Otherwise [without being inspired by Lord Kṛṣṇa] how is it that you have voluntarily appeared here, though you are moving incognito to the common man and are not visible to us who are on the verge of death?
ataḥ pṛcchāmi saṁsiddhim yoginām paramam gurum puruṣasya iha yat kāryam mriyamāṇasya sarvathā	You are the spiritual master of great saints and devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for all persons, and especially for one who is about to die.
yat śrotavyam atho japyam yat kartavyam nṛbhiḥ prabho smartavyam bhajanīyam vā brūhi yad vā viparyayam	Please let me know what a man should hear, chant, remember and worship, and also what he should not do. Please explain all this to me.
nūnam bhagavataḥ brahman gṛheṣu gṛha medhinām na lakṣyate hi avasthānam api go dohanam kvacit	O powerful brāhmaṇa, it is said that you hardly stay in the houses of men long enough to milk a cow.
sūtaḥ uvāca evam ābhāṣitaḥ pṛṣṭaḥ saḥ rājñā ślakṣṇayā girā pratyabhāṣata dharma jñaḥ bhagavān bādarāyaṇiḥ	Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: The King thus spoke and questioned the sage, using sweet language. Then the great and powerful personality, the son of Vyāsadeva, who knew the principles of religion, began his reply.
śrī śukaḥ uvāca varīyān eṣaḥ te praśnaḥ kṛtaḥ loka hitam nṛpa ātmavit sammataḥ puṁsām śrotavya ādiṣu yaḥ paraḥ	Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial to all kinds of people. The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists.
śrotavya ādīni rājendra nṛṇām santi sahasraśaḥ apaśyatām ātma tattvam gṛheṣu gṛha medhinām	Those persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor.
nidrayā hriyate naktam vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ divā ca artha īhayā rājan kuṭumba bharaṇena vā	The lifetime of such an envious householder is passed at night either in sleeping or in sex indulgence, and in the daytime either in making money or maintaining family members.
deha apatya kalatra ādiṣu ātma sainyeṣu asatsu api teṣām pramattaḥ nidhanam paśyan api na paśyati	Persons devoid of ātma-tattva do not inquire into the problems of life, being too attached to the fallible soldiers like the body, children and wife. Although sufficiently experienced, they still do not see their inevitable destruction.
tasmāt bhārata sarvātmā bhagavān īśvaraḥ hariḥ śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaḥ ca smartavyaḥ ca icchatā abhayam	O descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must hear about, glorify and also remember the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all miseries.
etāvān sāṅkhya yogābhyām sva dharma pariniṣṭhayā janma lābhaḥ paraḥ puṁsām ante nārāyaṇa smṛtiḥ	The highest perfection of human life, achieved either by complete knowledge of matter and spirit, by practice of mystic powers, or by perfect discharge of occupational duty, is to remember the Personality of Godhead at the end of life.
prāyeṇa munayaḥ rājan nivṛttāḥ vidhi ṣedhataḥ nairguṇya sthāḥ ramante sma guṇa anukathane hareḥ	O King Parīkṣit, mainly the topmost transcendentalists, who are above the regulative principles and restrictions, take pleasure in describing the glories of the Lord.
idam bhāgavatam nāma purāṇam brahma sammitam adhītavān dvāpara ādau pituḥ dvaipāyanāt aham	At the end of the Dvāpara-yuga, I studied this great supplement of Vedic literature named Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which is equal to all the Vedas, from my father, Śrīla Dvaipāyana Vyāsadeva.
pariniṣṭhitaḥ api nairguṇye uttama śloka līlayā gṛhīta cetāḥ rājarṣe ākhyānam yat adhītavān	O saintly King, I was certainly situated perfectly in transcendence, yet I was still attracted by the delineation of the pastimes of the Lord, who is described by enlightened verses.
tat aham te abhidhāsyāmi mahā pauruṣikaḥ bhavān yasya śraddadhatām āśu syāt mukunde matiḥ satī	That very Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam I shall recite before you because you are the most sincere devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. One who gives full attention and respect to hearing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam achieves unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord, the giver of salvation.
etat nirvidyamānānām icchatām akutaḥ bhayam yoginām nṛpa nirṇītam hareḥ nāma anu kīrtanam	O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge.
kim pramattasya bahubhiḥ parokṣaiḥ hāyanaiḥ iha varam muhūrtam viditam ghaṭate śreyase yataḥ	What is the value of a prolonged life which is wasted, inexperienced by years in this world? Better a moment of full consciousness, because that gives one a start in searching after his supreme interest.
khaṭvāṅgaḥ nāma rāja ṛṣiḥ jñātvā iyattām iha āyuṣaḥ muhūrtāt sarvam utsṛjya gatavān abhayam harim	The saintly King Khaṭvāṅga, after being informed that the duration of his life would be only a moment more, at once freed himself from all material activities and took shelter of the supreme safety, the Personality of Godhead.
tava api etarhi kauravya saptāham jīvita avadhiḥ upakalpaya tat sarvam tāvat yat sāmparāyikam	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, now your duration of life is limited to seven more days, so during this time you can perform all those rituals which are needed for the best purpose of your next life.
anta kāle tu puruṣaḥ āgate gata sādhvasaḥ chindyāt asaṅga śastreṇa spṛhām dehe anu ye ca tam	At the last stage of one’s life, one should be bold enough not to be afraid of death. But one must cut off all attachment to the material body and everything pertaining to it and all desires thereof.
gṛhāt pravrajitaḥ dhīraḥ puṇya tīrtha jala āplutaḥ śucau vivikte āsīnaḥ vidhivat kalpita āsane	One should leave home and practice self-control. In a sacred place he should bathe regularly and sit down in a lonely place duly sanctified.
abhyaset manasā śuddham tri vṛt brahma akṣaram param manaḥ yacchet jita śvāsaḥ brahma bījam avismaran	After sitting in the above manner, make the mind remember the three transcendental letters [a-u-m], and by regulating the breathing process, control the mind so as not to forget the transcendental seed.
niyacchet viṣayebhyaḥ akṣān manasā buddhi sārathiḥ manaḥ karmabhiḥ ākṣiptam śubha arthe dhārayet dhiyā	Gradually, as the mind becomes progressively spiritualized, withdraw it from sense activities, and by intelligence the senses will be controlled. The mind too absorbed in material activities can be engaged in the service of the Personality of Godhead and become fixed in full transcendental consciousness.
tatra eka avayavam dhyāyet avyucchinnena cetasā manaḥ nirviṣayam yuktvā tataḥ kiñcana na smaret padam tat paramam viṣṇoḥ manaḥ yatra prasīdati	Thereafter, you should meditate upon the limbs of Viṣṇu, one after another, without being deviated from the conception of the complete body. Thus the mind becomes free from all sense objects. There should be no other thing to be thought upon. Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is the Ultimate Truth, the mind becomes completely reconciled in Him only.
rajaḥ tamobhyām ākṣiptam vimūḍham manaḥ ātmanaḥ yacchet dhāraṇayā dhīraḥ hanti yā tat kṛtam malam	One’s mind is always agitated by the passionate mode of material nature and bewildered by the ignorant mode of nature. But one can rectify such conceptions by the relation of Viṣṇu and thus become pacified by cleansing the dirty things created by them.
yasyām sandhāryamāṇāyām yoginaḥ bhakti lakṣaṇaḥ āśu sampadyate yogaḥ āśrayam bhadram īkṣataḥ	O King, by this system of remembrance and by being fixed in the habit of seeing the all-good personal conception of the Lord, one can very soon attain devotional service to the Lord, under His direct shelter.
rājā uvāca yathā sandhāryate brahman dhāraṇā yatra sammatā yādṛśī vā haret āśu puruṣasya manaḥ malam	The fortunate King Parīkṣit, inquiring further, said: O brāhmaṇa, please describe in full detail how and where the mind has to be applied and how the conception can be fixed so that the dirty things in a person’s mind can be removed.
śrī śukaḥ uvāca jita āsanaḥ jita śvāsaḥ jita saṅgaḥ jita indriyaḥ sthūle bhagavataḥ rūpe manaḥ sandhārayet dhiyā	Śukadeva Gosvāmī answered: One should control the sitting posture, regulate the breathing process by the yogic prāṇāyāma and thus control the mind and senses and with intelligence apply the mind to the gross potencies of the Lord [called the virāṭ-rūpa].
viśeṣaḥ tasya dehaḥ ayam sthaviṣṭhaḥ ca sthavīyasām yatra idam vyajyate viśvam bhūtam bhavyam bhavat ca sat	This gigantic manifestation of the phenomenal material world as a whole is the personal body of the Absolute Truth, wherein the universal resultant past, present and future of material time is experienced.
aṇḍa kośe śarīre asmin sapta āvaraṇa saṁyute vairājaḥ puruṣaḥ yaḥ asau bhagavān dhāraṇā āśrayaḥ	The gigantic universal form of the Personality of Godhead, within the body of the universal shell, which is covered by sevenfold material elements, is the subject for the virāṭ conception.
pātālam etasya hi pāda mūlam paṭhanti pārṣṇi prapade rasātalam mahātalam viśva sṛjaḥ atha gulphau talātalam vai puruṣasya jaṅghe	Persons who have realized it have studied that the planets known as Pātāla constitute the bottoms of the feet of the universal Lord, and the heels and the toes are the Rasātala planets. The ankles are the Mahātala planets, and His shanks constitute the Talātala planets.
dve jānunī sutalam viśva mūrteḥ ūru dvayam vitalam ca atalam ca mahītalam tat jaghanam mahīpate nabhastalam nābhi saraḥ gṛṇanti	The knees of the universal form are the planetary system of the name Sutala, and the two thighs are the Vitala and Atala planetary systems. The hips are Mahītala, and outer space is the depression of His navel.
uraḥ sthalam jyotiḥ anīkam asya grīvā mahaḥ vadanam vai janaḥ asya tapaḥ varāṭīm viduḥ ādi puṁsaḥ satyam tu śīrṣāṇi sahasra śīrṣṇaḥ	The chest of the Original Personality of the gigantic form is the luminary planetary system, His neck is the Mahar planets, His mouth is the Janas planets, and His forehead is the Tapas planetary system. The topmost planetary system, known as Satyaloka, is the head of He who has one thousand heads.
indra ādayaḥ bāhavaḥ āhuḥ usrāḥ karṇau diśaḥ śrotram amuṣya śabdaḥ nāsatya dasrau paramasya nāse ghrāṇaḥ asya gandhaḥ mukham agniḥ iddhaḥ	His arms are the demigods headed by Indra, the ten directional sides are His ears, and physical sound is His sense of hearing. His nostrils are the two Aśvinī-kumāras, and material fragrance is His sense of smell. His mouth is the blazing fire.
dyauḥ akṣiṇī cakṣuḥ abhūt pataṅgaḥ pakṣmāṇi viṣṇoḥ ahanī ubhe ca tat bhrū vijṛmbhaḥ parameṣṭhi dhiṣṇyam āpaḥ asya tālū rasaḥ eva jihvā	The sphere of outer space constitutes His eyepits, and the eyeball is the sun as the power of seeing. His eyelids are both the day and night, and in the movements of His eyebrows, Brahmā and similar supreme personalities reside. His palate is the director of water, Varuṇa, and the juice or essence of everything is His tongue.
chandāṁsi anantasya śiraḥ gṛṇanti daṁṣṭrāḥ yamaḥ sneha kalāḥ dvijāni hāsaḥ jana unmāda karī ca māyā duranta sargaḥ yat apāṅga mokṣaḥ	They say that the Vedic hymns are the cerebral passage of the Lord, and His jaws of teeth are Yama, god of death, who punishes the sinners. The art of affection is His set of teeth, and the most alluring illusory material energy is His smile. This great ocean of material creation is but the casting of His glance over us.
vrīḍa uttara oṣṭha adharaḥ eva lobhaḥ dharmaḥ stanaḥ adharma pathaḥ asya pṛṣṭham kaḥ tasya meḍhram vṛṣaṇau ca mitrau kukṣiḥ samudrāḥ girayaḥ asthi saṅghāḥ	Modesty is the upper portion of His lips, hankering is His chin, religion is the breast of the Lord, and irreligion is His back. Brahmājī, who generates all living beings in the material world, is His genitals, and the Mitrā-varuṇas are His two testicles. The ocean is His waist, and the hills and mountains are the stacks of His bones.
nadyaḥ asya nāḍyaḥ atha tanū ruhāṇi mahī ruhāḥ viśva tanoḥ nṛpa indra ananta vīryaḥ śvasitam mātariśvā gatiḥ vayaḥ karma guṇa pravāhaḥ	O King, the rivers are the veins of the gigantic body, the trees are the hairs of His body, and the omnipotent air is His breath. The passing ages are His movements, and His activities are the reactions of the three modes of material nature.
īśasya keśān viduḥ ambu vāhān vāsaḥ tu sandhyām kuru varya bhūmnaḥ avyaktam āhuḥ hṛdayam manaḥ ca saḥ candramāḥ sarva vikāra kośaḥ	O best amongst the Kurus, the clouds which carry water are the hairs on His head, the terminations of days or nights are His dress, and the supreme cause of material creation is His intelligence. His mind is the moon, the reservoir of all changes.
vijñāna śaktim mahim āmananti sarva ātmanaḥ antaḥ karaṇam giritram aśva aśvatari uṣṭra gajāḥ nakhāni sarve mṛgāḥ paśavaḥ śroṇi deśe	The principle of matter [mahat-tattva] is the consciousness of the omnipresent Lord, as asserted by the experts, and Rudradeva is His ego. The horse, mule, camel and elephant are His nails, and wild animals and all quadrupeds are situated in the belt zone of the Lord.
vayāṁsi tat vyākaraṇam vicitram manuḥ manīṣā manujaḥ nivāsaḥ gandharva vidyādhara cāraṇa apsaraḥ svara smṛtīḥ asura anīka vīryaḥ	Varieties of birds are indications of His masterful artistic sense. Manu, the father of mankind, is the emblem of His standard intelligence, and humanity is His residence. The celestial species of human beings, like the Gandharvas, Vidyādharas, Cāraṇas and angels, all represent His musical rhythm, and the demoniac soldiers are representations of His wonderful prowess.
brahma ānanam kṣatra bhujaḥ mahātmā viṭ ūruḥ aṅghri śrita kṛṣṇa varṇaḥ nānā abhidhā abhījya gaṇa upapannaḥ dravya ātmakaḥ karma vitāna yogaḥ	The virāṭ-puruṣa’s face is the brāhmaṇas, His arms are the kṣatriyas, His thighs are the vaiśyas, and the śūdras are under the protection of His feet. All the worshipable demigods are also overtaken by Him, and it is the duty of everyone to perform sacrifices with feasible goods to appease the Lord.
iyān asau īśvara vigrahasya yaḥ sanniveśaḥ kathitaḥ mayā te sandhāryate asmin vapuṣi sthaviṣṭhe manaḥ sva buddhyā na yataḥ asti kiñcit	I have thus explained to you the gross material gigantic conception of the Personality of Godhead. One who seriously desires liberation concentrates his mind on this form of the Lord, because there is nothing more than this in the material world.
saḥ sarva dhī vṛtti anubhūta sarve ātmā yathā svapna jana īkṣita ekaḥ tam satyam ānanda nidhim bhajeta na anyatra sajjet yataḥ ātma pātaḥ	One should concentrate his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who alone distributes Himself in so many manifestations just as ordinary persons create thousands of manifestations in dreams. One must concentrate the mind on Him, the only all-blissful Absolute Truth. Otherwise one will be misled and will cause his own degradation.
śrī śukaḥ uvāca evam purā dhāraṇayā ātma yoniḥ naṣṭām smṛtim pratyavarudhya tuṣṭāt tathā sasarja idam amogha dṛṣṭiḥ yathā apyayāt prāk vyavasāya buddhiḥ	Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Formerly, prior to the manifestation of the cosmos, Lord Brahmā, by meditating on the virāṭ-rūpa, regained his lost consciousness by appeasing the Lord. Thus he was able to rebuild the creation as it was before.
śābdasya hi brahmaṇaḥ eṣaḥ panthāḥ yat nāmabhiḥ dhyāyati dhīḥ apārthaiḥ paribhraman tatra na vindate arthān māyā maye vāsanayā śayānaḥ	The way of presentation of the Vedic sounds is so bewildering that it directs the intelligence of the people to meaningless things like the heavenly kingdoms. The conditioned souls hover in dreams of such heavenly illusory pleasures, but actually they do not relish any tangible happiness in such places.
ataḥ kaviḥ nāmasu yāvat arthaḥ syāt apramattaḥ vyavasāya buddhiḥ siddhe anyathā arthe na yateta tatra pariśramam tatra samīkṣamāṇaḥ	For this reason the enlightened person should endeavor only for the minimum necessities of life while in the world of names. He should be intelligently fixed and never endeavor for unwanted things, being competent to perceive practically that all such endeavors are merely hard labor for nothing.
satyām kṣitau kim kaśipoḥ prayāsaiḥ bāhau sva siddhe hi upabarhaṇaiḥ kim sati añjalau kim purudhā anna pātryā dik valkala ādau sati kim dukūlaiḥ	When there are ample earthly flats to lie on, what is the necessity of cots and beds? When one can use his own arms, what is the necessity of a pillow? When one can use the palms of his hands, what is the necessity of varieties of utensils? When there is ample covering, or the skins of trees, what is the necessity of clothing?
cīrāṇi kim pathi na santi diśanti bhikṣām na eva aṅghripāḥ para bhṛtaḥ saritaḥ api aśuṣyan ruddhāḥ guhāḥ kim ajitaḥ avati na upasannān kasmāt bhajanti kavayaḥ dhana durmada andhān	Are there no torn clothes lying on the common road? Do the trees, which exist for maintaining others, no longer give alms in charity? Do the rivers, being dried up, no longer supply water to the thirsty? Are the caves of the mountains now closed? Or above all, does the Almighty Lord not protect the fully surrendered souls? Why then do the learned sages go to flatter those who are intoxicated by hard-earned wealth?
evam sva citte svataḥ eva siddhaḥ ātmā priyaḥ arthaḥ bhagavān anantaḥ tam nirvṛtaḥ niyata arthaḥ bhajeta saṁsāra hetu uparamaḥ ca yatra	Thus being fixed, one must render service unto the Supersoul situated in one’s own heart by His omnipotency. Because He is the Almighty Personality of Godhead, eternal and unlimited, He is the ultimate goal of life, and by worshiping Him one can end the cause of the conditioned state of existence.
kaḥ tām tu anādṛtya para anucintām ṛte paśūn asatīm nāma kuryāt paśyan janam patitam vaitaraṇyām sva karma jān paritāpān juṣāṇam	Who else but the gross materialists will neglect such transcendental thought and take to the nonpermanent names only, seeing the mass of people fallen in the river of suffering as the consequence of accruing the result of their own work?
kecit sva deha antaḥ hṛdaya avakāśe prādeśa mātram puruṣam vasantam catuḥ bhujam kañja ratha aṅga śaṅkha gadā dharam dhāraṇayā smaranti	Others conceive of the Personality of Godhead residing within the body in the region of the heart and measuring only eight inches, with four hands carrying a lotus, a wheel of a chariot, a conchshell and a club respectively.
prasanna vaktram nalina āyata īkṣaṇam kadamba kiñjalka piśaṅga vāsasam lasat mahā ratna hiraṇmaya aṅgadam sphurat mahā ratna kirīṭa kuṇḍalam	His mouth expresses His happiness. His eyes spread like the petals of a lotus, and His garments, yellowish like the saffron of a kadamba flower, are bedecked with valuable jewels. His ornaments are all made of gold, set with jewels, and He wears a glowing headdress and earrings.
unnidra hṛt paṅkaja karṇikā ālaye yoga īśvara āsthāpita pāda pallavam śrī lakṣaṇam kaustubha ratna kandharam amlāna lakṣmyā vana mālayā ācitam	His lotus feet are placed over the whorls of the lotuslike hearts of great mystics. On His chest is the Kaustubha jewel, engraved with a beautiful calf, and there are other jewels on His shoulders. His complete torso is garlanded with fresh flowers.
vibhūṣitam mekhalayā aṅgulīyakaiḥ mahā dhanaiḥ nūpura kaṅkaṇa ādibhiḥ snigdha amala ākuñcita nīla kuntalaiḥ virocamāna ānana hāsa peśalam	He is well decorated with an ornamental wreath about His waist and rings studded with valuable jewels on His fingers. His leglets, His bangles, His oiled hair, curling with a bluish tint, and His beautiful smiling face are all very pleasing.
adīna līlā hasita īkṣaṇa ullasat bhrū bhaṅga saṁsūcita bhūri anugraham īkṣeta cintāmayam enam īśvaram yāvat manaḥ dhāraṇayā avatiṣṭhate	The Lord’s magnanimous pastimes and the glowing glancing of His smiling face are all indications of His extensive benedictions. One must therefore concentrate on this transcendental form of the Lord, as long as the mind can be fixed on Him by meditation.
eka ekaśaḥ aṅgāni dhiyā anubhāvayet pāda ādi yāvat hasitam gadā bhṛtaḥ jitam jitam sthānam apohya dhārayet param param śuddhyati dhīḥ yathā yathā	The process of meditation should begin from the lotus feet of the Lord and progress to His smiling face. The meditation should be concentrated upon the lotus feet, then the calves, then the thighs, and in this way higher and higher. The more the mind becomes fixed upon the different parts of the limbs, one after another, the more the intelligence becomes purified.
yāvat na jāyeta para avare asmin viśva īśvare draṣṭari bhakti yogaḥ tāvat sthavīyaḥ puruṣasya rūpam kriyā avasāne prayataḥ smareta	Unless the gross materialist develops a sense of loving service unto the Supreme Lord, the seer of both the transcendental and material worlds, he should remember or meditate upon the universal form of the Lord at the end of his prescribed duties.
sthiram sukham ca āsanam āsthitaḥ yatiḥ yadā jihāsuḥ imam aṅga lokam kāle ca deśe ca manaḥ na sajjayet prāṇān niyacchet manasā jita asuḥ	O King, whenever the yogī desires to leave this planet of human beings, he should not be perplexed about the proper time or place, but should comfortably sit without being disturbed and, regulating the life air, should control the senses by the mind.
manaḥ sva buddhyā amalayā niyamya kṣetra jñe etām ninayet tam ātmani ātmānam ātmani avarudhya dhīraḥ labdha upaśāntiḥ virameta kṛtyāt	Thereafter, the yogī should merge his mind, by his unalloyed intelligence, into the living entity, and then merge the living entity into the Superself. And by doing this, the fully satisfied living entity becomes situated in the supreme stage of satisfaction, so that he ceases from all other activities.
na yatra kālaḥ animiṣām paraḥ prabhuḥ kutaḥ nu devāḥ jagatām ye īśire na yatra sattvam na rajaḥ tamaḥ ca na vai vikāraḥ na mahān pradhānam	In that transcendental state of labdhopaśānti, there is no supremacy of devastating time, which controls even the celestial demigods who are empowered to rule over mundane creatures. (And what to speak of the demigods themselves?) Nor is there the mode of material goodness, nor passion, nor ignorance, nor even the false ego, nor the material Causal Ocean, nor the material nature.
param padam vaiṣṇavam āmananti tat yat na iti na iti iti atat utsisṛkṣavaḥ visṛjya daurātmyam ananya sauhṛdāḥ hṛdā upaguhya arha padam pade pade	The transcendentalists desire to avoid everything godless, for they know that supreme situation in which everything is related with the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore a pure devotee who is in absolute harmony with the Lord does not create perplexities, but worships the lotus feet of the Lord at every moment, taking them into his heart.
ittham muniḥ tu uparamet vyavasthitaḥ vijñāna dṛk vīrya su randhita āśayaḥ sva pārṣṇinā āpīḍya gudam tataḥ anilam sthāneṣu ṣaṭsu unnamayet jita klamaḥ	By the strength of scientific knowledge, one should be well situated in absolute realization and thus be able to extinguish all material desires. One should then give up the material body by blocking the air hole [through which stool is evacuated] with the heel of one’s foot and by lifting the life air from one place to another in the six primary places.
nābhyām sthitam hṛdi adhiropya tasmāt udāna gatya urasi tam nayet muniḥ tataḥ anusandhāya dhiyā manasvī sva tālu mūlam śanakaiḥ nayeta	The meditative devotee should slowly push up the life air from the navel to the heart, from there to the chest, and from there to the root of the palate. He should search out the proper places with intelligence.
tasmāt bhruvoḥ antaram unnayeta niruddha sapta āyatanaḥ anapekṣaḥ sthitvā muhūrta ardham akuṇṭha dṛṣṭiḥ nirbhidya mūrdhan visṛjet param gataḥ	Thereafter the bhakti-yogī should push the life air up between the eyebrows, and then, blocking the seven outlets of the life air, he should maintain his aim for going back home, back to Godhead. If he is completely free from all desires for material enjoyment, he should then reach the cerebral hole and give up his material connections, having gone to the Supreme.
yadi prayāsyan nṛpa pārameṣṭhyam vaihāyasānām uta yat vihāram aṣṭa ādhipatyam guṇa sannivāye saha eva gacchet manasā indriyaiḥ ca	However, O King, if a yogī maintains a desire for improved material enjoyments, like transference to the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, or the achievement of the eightfold perfections, travel in outer space with the Vaihāyasas, or a situation in one of the millions of planets, then he has to take away with him the materially molded mind and senses.
yoga īśvarāṇām gatim āhuḥ antaḥ bahiḥ tri lokyāḥ pavana antaḥ ātmanām na karmabhiḥ tām gatim āpnuvanti vidyā tapaḥ yoga samādhi bhājām	The transcendentalists are concerned with the spiritual body. As such, by the strength of their devotional service, austerities, mystic power and transcendental knowledge, their movements are unrestricted, within and beyond the material worlds. The fruitive workers, or the gross materialists, can never move in such an unrestricted manner.
vaiśvānaram yāti vihāyasā gataḥ suṣumṇayā brahma pathena śociṣā vidhūta kalkaḥ atha hareḥ udastāt prayāti cakram nṛpa śaiśumāram	O King, when such a mystic passes over the Milky Way by the illuminating Suṣumṇā to reach the highest planet, Brahmaloka, he goes first to Vaiśvānara, the planet of the deity of fire, wherein he becomes completely cleansed of all contaminations, and thereafter he still goes higher, to the circle of Śiśumāra, to relate with Lord Hari, the Personality of Godhead.
tat viśva nābhim tu ativartya viṣṇoḥ aṇīyasā virajena ātmanā ekaḥ namaskṛtam brahma vidām upaiti kalpa āyuṣaḥ yat vibudhāḥ ramante	This Śiśumāra is the pivot for the turning of the complete universe, and it is called the navel of Viṣṇu [Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu]. The yogī alone goes beyond this circle of Śiśumāra and attains the planet [Maharloka] where purified saints like Bhṛgu enjoy a duration of life of 4,300,000,000 solar years. This planet is worshipable even for saints who are transcendentally situated.
atho anantasya mukha analena dandahyamānam saḥ nirīkṣya viśvam niryāti siddheśvara yuṣṭa dhiṣṇyam yat dvai parārdhyam tat u pārameṣṭhyam	At the time of the final devastation of the complete universe [the end of the duration of Brahmā’s life], a flame of fire emanates from the mouth of Ananta [from the bottom of the universe]. The yogī sees all the planets of the universe burning to ashes, and thus he leaves for Satyaloka by airplanes used by the great purified souls. The duration of life in Satyaloka is calculated to be 15,480,000,000,000 years.
na yatra śokaḥ na jarā na mṛtyuḥ na artiḥ na ca udvegaḥ ṛte kutaścit yat cit tataḥ adaḥ kṛpayā an idam vidām duranta duḥkha prabhava anudarśanāt	In that planet of Satyaloka, there is neither bereavement, nor old age nor death. There is no pain of any kind, and therefore there are no anxieties, save that sometimes, due to consciousness, there is a feeling of compassion for those unaware of the process of devotional service, who are subjected to unsurpassable miseries in the material world.
tataḥ viśeṣam pratipadya nirbhayaḥ tena ātmanā āpaḥ anala mūrtiḥ atvaran jyotiḥ mayaḥ vāyum upetya kāle vāyu ātmanā kham bṛhat ātma liṅgam	After reaching Satyaloka, the devotee is specifically able to be incorporated fearlessly by the subtle body in an identity similar to that of the gross body, and one after another he gradually attains stages of existence from earthly to watery, fiery, glowing and airy, until he reaches the ethereal stage.
ghrāṇena gandham rasanena vai rasam rūpam ca dṛṣṭyā śvasanam tvacā eva śrotreṇa ca upetya nabhaḥ guṇatvam prāṇena ca ākūtim upaiti yogī	The devotee thus surpasses the subtle objects of different senses like aroma by smelling, the palate by tasting, vision by seeing forms, touch by contacting, the vibrations of the ear by ethereal identification, and the sense organs by material activities.
saḥ bhūta sūkṣma indriya sannikarṣam manaḥ mayam deva mayam vikāryam saṁsādya gatyā saha tena yāti vijñāna tattvam guṇa sannirodham	The devotee, thus surpassing the gross and the subtle forms of coverings, enters the plane of egoism. And in that status he merges the material modes of nature [ignorance and passion] in this point of neutralization and thus reaches egoism in goodness. After this, all egoism is merged in the mahat-tattva, and he comes to the point of pure self-realization.
tena ātmanā ātmānam upaiti śāntam ānandam ānanda mayaḥ avasāne etām gatim bhāgavatīm gataḥ yaḥ saḥ vai punaḥ na iha viṣajjate aṅga	Only the purified soul can attain the perfection of associating with the Personality of Godhead in complete bliss and satisfaction in his constitutional state. Whoever is able to renovate such devotional perfection is never again attracted by this material world, and he never returns.
ete sṛtī te nṛpa veda gīte tvayā abhipṛṣṭe ca sanātane ca ye vai purā brahmaṇe āha tuṣṭaḥ ārādhitaḥ bhagavān vāsudevaḥ	Your Majesty Mahārāja Parīkṣit, know that all that I have described in reply to your proper inquiry is just according to the version of the Vedas, and it is eternal truth. This was described personally by Lord Kṛṣṇa unto Brahmā, with whom the Lord was satisfied upon being properly worshiped.
na hi ataḥ anyaḥ śivaḥ panthāḥ viśataḥ saṁsṛtau iha vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti yogaḥ yataḥ bhavet	For those who are wandering in the material universe, there is no more auspicious means of deliverance than what is aimed at in the direct devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
bhagavān brahma kārtsnyena triḥ anvīkṣya manīṣayā tat adhyavasyat kūṭa sthaḥ ratiḥ ātman (ātmani) yataḥ bhavet	The great personality Brahmā, with great attention and concentration of the mind, studied the Vedas three times, and after scrutinizingly examining them, he ascertained that attraction for the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the highest perfection of religion.
bhagavān sarva bhūteṣu lakṣitaḥ sva ātmanā hariḥ dṛśyaiḥ buddhi ādibhiḥ draṣṭā lakṣaṇaiḥ anumāpakaiḥ	The Personality of Godhead Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is in every living being along with the individual soul. And this fact is perceived and hypothesized in our acts of seeing and taking help from the intelligence.
tasmāt sarva ātmanā rājan hariḥ sarvatra sarvadā śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaḥ ca smartavyaḥ bhagavān nṛṇām	O King, it is therefore essential that every human being hear about, glorify and remember the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, always and everywhere.
pibanti ye bhagavataḥ ātmanaḥ satām kathā amṛtam śravaṇa puṭeṣu sambhṛtam punanti te viṣaya vidūṣita āśayam vrajanti tat caraṇa saroruha antikam	Those who drink through aural reception, fully filled with the nectarean message of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the beloved of the devotees, purify the polluted aim of life known as material enjoyment and thus go back to Godhead, to the lotus feet of Him [the Personality of Godhead].
śrī śukaḥ uvāca evam etat nigaditam pṛṣṭavān yat bhavān mama nṛṇām yat mriyamāṇānām manuṣyeṣu manīṣiṇām	Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Mahārāja Parīkṣit, as you have inquired from me as to the duty of the intelligent man who is on the threshold of death, so I have answered you.
brahma varcasa kāmaḥ tu yajeta brahmaṇaḥ patim indram indriya kāmaḥ tu prajā kāmaḥ prajāpatīn devīm māyām tu śrī kāmaḥ tejaḥ kāmaḥ vibhāvasum vasu kāmaḥ vasūn rudrān vīrya kāmaḥ atha vīryavān anna adya kāmaḥ tu aditim svarga kāmaḥ aditeḥ sutān viśvān devān rājya kāmaḥ sādhyān saṁsādhakaḥ viśām āyuḥ kāmaḥ aśvinau devau puṣṭi kāmaḥ ilām yajet pratiṣṭhā kāmaḥ puruṣaḥ rodasī loka mātarau rūpa abhikāmaḥ gandharvān strī kāmaḥ apsaraḥ urvaśīm ādhipatya kāmaḥ sarveṣām yajeta parameṣṭhinam yajñam yajet yaśaḥ kāmaḥ kośa kāmaḥ pracetasam vidyā kāmaḥ tu giriśam dāmpatya arthaḥ umām satīm	One who desires to be absorbed in the impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence should worship the master of the Vedas [Lord Brahmā or Bṛhaspati, the learned priest], one who desires powerful sex should worship the heavenly King, Indra, and one who desires good progeny should worship the great progenitors called the Prajāpatis. One who desires good fortune should worship Durgādevī, the superintendent of the material world. One desiring to be very powerful should worship fire, and one who aspires only after money should worship the Vasus. One should worship the Rudra incarnations of Lord Śiva if he wants to be a great hero. One who wants a large stock of grains should worship Aditi. One who desires to attain the heavenly planets should worship the sons of Aditi. One who desires a worldly kingdom should worship Viśvadeva, and one who wants to be popular with the general mass of population should worship the Sādhya demigod. One who desires a long span of life should worship the demigods known as the Aśvinī-kumāras, and a person desiring a strongly built body should worship the earth. One who desires stability in his post should worship the horizon and the earth combined. One who desires to be beautiful should worship the beautiful residents of the Gandharva planet, and one who desires a good wife should worship the Apsarās and the Urvaśī society girls of the heavenly kingdom. One who desires domination over others should worship Lord Brahmā, the head of the universe. One who desires tangible fame should worship the Personality of Godhead, and one who desires a good bank balance should worship the demigod Varuṇa. If one desires to be a greatly learned man he should worship Lord Śiva, and if one desires a good marital relation he should worship the chaste goddess Umā, the wife of Lord Śiva.
dharma arthaḥ uttama ślokam tantuḥ tanvan pitṝn yajet rakṣā kāmaḥ puṇya janān ojaḥ kāmaḥ marut gaṇān	One should worship Lord Viṣṇu or His devotee for spiritual advancement in knowledge, and for protection of heredity and advancement of a dynasty one should worship the various demigods.
rājya kāmaḥ manūn devān nirṛtim tu abhicaran yajet kāma kāmaḥ yajet somam akāmaḥ puruṣam param	One who desires domination over a kingdom or an empire should worship the Manus. One who desires victory over an enemy should worship the demons, and one who desires sense gratification should worship the moon. But one who desires nothing of material enjoyment should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
akāmaḥ sarva kāmaḥ vā mokṣa kāmaḥ udāra dhīḥ tīvreṇa bhakti yogena yajeta puruṣam param	A person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of all material desire, without any material desire, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.
etāvān eva yajatām iha niḥśreyasa udayaḥ bhagavati acalaḥ bhāvaḥ yat bhāgavata saṅgataḥ	All the different kinds of worshipers of multidemigods can attain the highest perfectional benediction, which is spontaneous attraction unflinchingly fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by the association of the pure devotee of the Lord.
jñānam yat ā pratinivṛtta guṇa ūrmi cakram ātma prasādaḥ uta yatra guṇeṣu asaṅgaḥ kaivalya sammata pathaḥ tu atha bhakti yogaḥ kaḥ nirvṛtaḥ hari kathāsu ratim na kuryāt	Transcendental knowledge in relation with the Supreme Lord Hari is knowledge resulting in the complete suspension of the waves and whirlpools of the material modes. Such knowledge is self-satisfying due to its being free from material attachment, and being transcendental it is approved by authorities. Who could fail to be attracted?
śaunakaḥ uvāca iti abhivyāhṛtam rājā niśamya bharata ṛṣabhaḥ kim anyat pṛṣṭavān bhūyaḥ vaiyāsakim ṛṣim kavim	Śaunaka said: The son of Vyāsadeva, Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, was a highly learned sage and was able to describe things in a poetic manner. What did Mahārāja Parīkṣit again inquire from him after hearing all that he had said?
etat śuśrūṣatām vidvan sūta naḥ arhasi bhāṣitum kathāḥ hari kathā udarkāḥ satām syuḥ sadasi dhruvam	O learned Sūta Gosvāmī! Please continue to explain such topics to us because we are all eager to hear. Besides that, topics which result in the discussion of the Lord Hari should certainly be discussed in the assembly of devotees.
saḥ vai bhāgavataḥ rājā pāṇḍaveyaḥ mahā rathaḥ bāla krīḍanakaiḥ krīḍan kṛṣṇa krīḍām yaḥ ādade	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the grandson of the Pāṇḍavas, was from his very childhood a great devotee of the Lord. Even while playing with dolls, he used to worship Lord Kṛṣṇa by imitating the worship of the family Deity.
vaiyāsakiḥ ca bhagavān vāsudeva parāyaṇaḥ urugāya guṇa udārāḥ satām syuḥ hi samāgame	Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of Vyāsadeva, was also full in transcendental knowledge and was a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva. So there must have been discussion of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is glorified by great philosophers and in the company of great devotees.
āyuḥ harati vai puṁsām udyan astam ca yan asau tasya ṛte yat kṣaṇaḥ nītaḥ uttama śloka vārtayā	Both by rising and by setting, the sun decreases the duration of life of everyone, except one who utilizes the time by discussing topics of the all-good Personality of Godhead.
taravaḥ kim na jīvanti bhastrāḥ kim na śvasanti uta na khādanti na mehanti kim grāme paśavaḥ apare	Do the trees not live? Do the bellows of the blacksmith not breathe? All around us, do the beasts not eat and discharge semen?
śva viṭ varāha uṣṭra kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ na yat karṇa patha upetaḥ jātu nāma gadāgrajaḥ	Men who are like dogs, hogs, camels and asses praise those men who never listen to the transcendental pastimes of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the deliverer from evils.
bile bata urukrama vikramān ye na śṛṇvataḥ karṇa puṭe narasya jihvā asatī dārdurikā iva sūta na ca upagāyati urugāya gāthāḥ	One who has not listened to the messages about the prowess and marvelous acts of the Personality of Godhead and has not sung or chanted loudly the worthy songs about the Lord is to be considered to possess earholes like the holes of snakes and a tongue like the tongue of a frog.
bhāraḥ param paṭṭa kirīṭa juṣṭam api uttama aṅgam na namet mukundam śāvau karau no kurute saparyām hareḥ lasat kāñcana kaṅkaṇau vā	The upper portion of the body, though crowned with a silk turban, is only a heavy burden if not bowed down before the Personality of Godhead who can award mukti [freedom]. And the hands, though decorated with glittering bangles, are like those of a dead man if not engaged in the service of the Personality of Godhead Hari.
barhāyite te nayane narāṇām liṅgāni viṣṇoḥ na nirīkṣataḥ ye pādau nṛṇām tau druma janma bhājau kṣetrāṇi na anuvrajataḥ hareḥ yau	The eyes which do not look at the symbolic representations of the Personality of Godhead Viṣṇu [His forms, name, quality, etc.] are like those printed on the plumes of the peacock, and the legs which do not move to the holy places [where the Lord is remembered] are considered to be like tree trunks.
jīvan śavaḥ bhāgavata aṅghri reṇum na jātu martyaḥ abhilabheta yaḥ tu śrī viṣṇu padyāḥ manu jaḥ tulasyāḥ śvasan śavaḥ yaḥ tu na veda gandham	The person who has not at any time received the dust of the feet of the Lord’s pure devotee upon his head is certainly a dead body. And the person who has never experienced the aroma of the tulasī leaves from the lotus feet of the Lord is also a dead body, although breathing.
tat aśma sāram hṛdayam bata idam yat gṛhyamāṇaiḥ hari nāma dheyaiḥ na vikriyeta atha yadā vikāraḥ netre jalam gātra ruheṣu harṣaḥ	Certainly that heart is steel-framed which, in spite of one’s chanting the holy name of the Lord with concentration, does not change when ecstasy takes place, tears fill the eyes and the hairs stand on end.
atha abhidhehi aṅga manaḥ anukūlam prabhāṣase bhāgavata pradhānaḥ yat āha vaiyāsakiḥ ātma vidyā viśāradaḥ nṛpatim sādhu pṛṣṭaḥ	O Sūta Gosvāmī, your words are pleasing to our minds. Please therefore explain this to us as it was spoken by the great devotee Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who is very expert in transcendental knowledge, and who spoke to Mahārāja Parīkṣit upon being asked.
sūtaḥ uvāca vaiyāsakeḥ iti vacaḥ tattva niścayam ātmanaḥ upadhārya matim kṛṣṇe auttareyaḥ satīm vyadhāt	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the son of Uttarā, after hearing the speeches of Śukadeva Gosvāmī, which were all about the truth of the self, applied his concentration faithfully upon Lord Kṛṣṇa.
ātma jāyā suta āgāra paśu draviṇa bandhuṣu rājye ca avikale nityam virūḍhām mamatām jahau	Mahārāja Parīkṣit, as a result of his wholehearted attraction for Lord Kṛṣṇa, was able to give up all deep-rooted affection for his personal body, his wife, his children, his palace, his animals like horses and elephants, his treasury house, his friends and relatives, and his undisputed kingdom.
papraccha ca imam eva artham yat mām pṛcchatha sattamāḥ kṛṣṇa anubhāva śravaṇe śraddadhānaḥ mahā manāḥ saṁsthām vijñāya sannyasya karma trai vargikam ca yat vāsudeve bhagavati ātma bhāvam dṛḍham gataḥ	O great sages, the great soul Mahārāja Parīkṣit, constantly rapt in thought of Lord Kṛṣṇa, knowing well of his imminent death, renounced all sorts of fruitive activities, namely acts of religion, economic development and sense gratification, and thus fixed himself firmly in his natural love for Kṛṣṇa and asked all these questions, exactly as you are asking me.
rājā uvāca samīcīnam vacaḥ brahman sarva jñasya tava anagha tamaḥ viśīryate mahyam hareḥ kathayataḥ kathām	Mahārāja Parīkṣit said: O learned brāhmaṇa, you know everything because you are without material contamination. Therefore whatever you have spoken to me appears perfectly right. Your speeches are gradually destroying the darkness of my ignorance, for you are narrating the topics of the Lord.
bhūyaḥ eva vivitsāmi bhagavān ātma māyayā yathā idam sṛjate viśvam durvibhāvyam adhīśvaraiḥ	I beg to know from you how the Personality of Godhead, by His personal energies, creates these phenomenal universes as they are, which are inconceivable even to the great demigods.
yathā gopāyati vibhuḥ yathā saṁyacchate punaḥ yām yām śaktim upāśritya puru śaktiḥ paraḥ pumān ātmānam krīḍayan krīḍan karoti vikaroti ca	Kindly describe how the Supreme Lord, who is all-powerful, engages His different energies and different expansions in maintaining and again winding up the phenomenal world in the sporting spirit of a player.
nūnam bhagavataḥ brahman hareḥ adbhuta karmaṇaḥ durvibhāvyam iva ābhāti kavibhiḥ ca api ceṣṭitam	O learned brāhmaṇa, the transcendental activities of the Lord are all wonderful, and they appear inconceivable because even great endeavors by many learned scholars have still proved insufficient for understanding them.
yathā guṇān tu prakṛteḥ yugapat kramaśaḥ api vā bibharti bhūriśaḥ tu ekaḥ kurvan karmāṇi janmabhiḥ	The Supreme Personality of Godhead is one, whether He alone acts with the modes of material nature, or simultaneously expands in many forms, or expands consecutively to direct the modes of nature.
vicikitsitam etat me bravītu bhagavān yathā śābde brahmaṇi niṣṇātaḥ parasmin ca bhavān khalu	Kindly clear up all these doubtful inquiries, because you are not only vastly learned in the Vedic literatures and self-realized in transcendence, but are also a great devotee of the Lord and are therefore as good as the Personality of Godhead.
sūtaḥ uvāca iti upāmantritaḥ rājñā guṇa anukathane hareḥ hṛṣīkeśam anusmṛtya prativaktum pracakrame	Sūta Gosvāmī said: When Śukadeva Gosvāmī was thus requested by the King to describe the creative energy of the Personality of Godhead, he then systematically remembered the master of the senses [Śrī Kṛṣṇa], and to reply properly he spoke thus.
śrī śukaḥ uvāca namaḥ parasmai puruṣāya bhūyase sad udbhava sthāna nirodha līlayā gṛhīta śakti tritayāya dehinām antaḥ bhavāya anupalakṣya vartmane	Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, for the creation of the material world, accepts the three modes of nature. He is the complete whole residing within the body of everyone, and His ways are inconceivable.
bhūyaḥ namaḥ sat vṛjina chide asatām asambhavāya akhila sattva mūrtaye puṁsām punaḥ pāramahaṁsye āśrame vyavasthitānām anumṛgya dāśuṣe	I again offer my respectful obeisances unto the form of complete existence and transcendence, who is the liberator of the pious devotees from all distresses and the destroyer of the further advances in atheistic temperament of the nondevotee-demons. For the transcendentalists who are situated in the topmost spiritual perfection, He grants their specific destinations.
namaḥ namaḥ te astu ṛṣabhāya sātvatām vidūra kāṣṭhāya muhuḥ ku yoginām nirasta sāmya atiśayena rādhasā sva dhāmani brahmaṇi raṁsyate namaḥ	Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Him who is the associate of the members of the Yadu dynasty and who is always a problem for the nondevotees. He is the supreme enjoyer of both the material and spiritual worlds, yet He enjoys His own abode in the spiritual sky. There is no one equal to Him because His transcendental opulence is immeasurable.
yat kīrtanam yat smaraṇam yat īkṣaṇam yat vandanam yat śravaṇam yat arhaṇam lokasya sadyaḥ vidhunoti kalmaṣam tasmai subhadra śravase namaḥ namaḥ	Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-auspicious Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, about whom glorification, remembrances, audience, prayers, hearing and worship can at once cleanse the effects of all sins of the performer.
vicakṣaṇāḥ yat caraṇa upasādanāt saṅgam vyudasya ubhayataḥ antaḥ ātmanaḥ vindanti hi brahma gatim gata klamāḥ tasmai subhadra śravase namaḥ namaḥ	Let me offer my respectful obeisances again and again unto the all-auspicious Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The highly intellectual, simply by surrendering unto His lotus feet, are relieved of all attachments to present and future existences and without difficulty progress toward spiritual existence.
tapasvinaḥ dāna parāḥ yaśasvinaḥ manasvinaḥ mantra vidaḥ su maṅgalāḥ kṣemam na vindanti vinā yat arpaṇam tasmai subhadra śravase namaḥ namaḥ	Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-auspicious Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa again and again because the great learned sages, the great performers of charity, the great workers of distinction, the great philosophers and mystics, the great chanters of the Vedic hymns and the great followers of Vedic principles cannot achieve any fruitful result without dedication of such great qualities to the service of the Lord.
kirāta hūṇa āndhra pulinda pulkaśāḥ ābhīra śumbhāḥ yavanāḥ khasa ādayaḥ ye anye ca pāpāḥ yat apāśraya āśrayāḥ śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ	Kirāta, Hūṇa, Āndhra, Pulinda, Pulkaśa, Ābhīra, Śumbha, Yavana, members of the Khasa races and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.
saḥ eṣaḥ ātmā ātmavatām adhīśvaraḥ trayī mayaḥ dharma mayaḥ tapaḥ mayaḥ gata vyalīkaiḥ aja śaṅkara ādibhiḥ vitarkya liṅgaḥ bhagavān prasīdatām	He is the Supersoul and the Supreme Lord of all self-realized souls. He is the personification of the Vedas, religious scriptures and austerities. He is worshiped by Lord Brahmā and Śiva and all those who are transcendental to all pretensions. Being so revered with awe and veneration, may that Supreme Absolute be pleased with me.
śriyaḥ patiḥ yajña patiḥ prajā patiḥ dhiyām patiḥ loka patiḥ dharā patiḥ patiḥ gatiḥ ca andhaka vṛṣṇi sātvatām prasīdatām me bhagavān satām patiḥ	May Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the worshipable Lord of all devotees, the protector and glory of all the kings like Andhaka and Vṛṣṇi of the Yadu dynasty, the husband of all goddesses of fortune, the director of all sacrifices and therefore the leader of all living entities, the controller of all intelligence, the proprietor of all planets, spiritual and material, and the supreme incarnation on the earth (the supreme all in all), be merciful upon me.
yat aṅghri abhidhyāna samādhi dhautayā dhiyā anupaśyanti hi tattvam ātmanaḥ vadanti ca etat kavayaḥ yathā rucam saḥ me mukundaḥ bhagavān prasīdatām	It is the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa who gives liberation. By thinking of His lotus feet at every second, following in the footsteps of authorities, the devotee in trance can see the Absolute Truth. The learned mental speculators, however, think of Him according to their whims. May the Lord be pleased with me.
pracoditā yena purā sarasvatī vitanvatā ajasya satīm smṛtim hṛdi sva lakṣaṇā prādurabhūt kila āsyataḥ saḥ me ṛṣīṇām ṛṣabhaḥ prasīdatām	May the Lord, who in the beginning of the creation amplified the potent knowledge of Brahmā from within his heart and inspired him with full knowledge of creation and of His own Self, and who appeared to be generated from the mouth of Brahmā, be pleased with me.
bhūtaiḥ mahadbhiḥ yaḥ imāḥ puraḥ vibhuḥ nirmāya śete yat amūṣu pūruṣaḥ bhuṅkte guṇān ṣoḍaśa ṣoḍaśa ātmakaḥ saḥ alaṅkṛṣīṣṭa bhagavān vacāṁsi me	May the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who enlivens the materially created bodies of the elements by lying down within the universe, and who in His puruṣa incarnation causes the living being to be subjected to the sixteen divisions of material modes which are his generator, be pleased to decorate my statements.
namaḥ tasmai bhagavate vāsudevāya vedhase papuḥ jñānam ayam saumyāḥ yat mukha amburuha āsavam	I offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrīla Vyāsadeva, the incarnation of Vāsudeva who compiled the Vedic scriptures. The pure devotees drink up the nectarean transcendental knowledge dropping from the lotuslike mouth of the Lord.
etat eva ātma bhūḥ rājan nāradāya vipṛcchate veda garbhaḥ abhyadhāt sākṣāt yat āha hariḥ ātmanaḥ	My dear King, Brahmā, the firstborn, on being questioned by Nārada, exactly apprised him on this subject as it had been directly spoken by the Lord to His own son, who was impregnated with Vedic knowledge from his very birth.
nāradaḥ uvāca deva deva namaḥ te astu bhūta bhāvana pūrva ja tat vijānīhi yat jñānam ātma tattva nidarśanam	Śrī Nārada Muni asked Brahmājī: O chief amongst the demigods, O firstborn living entity, I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto you. Please tell me that transcendental knowledge which specifically directs one to the truth of the individual soul and the Supersoul.
yat rūpam yat adhiṣṭhānam yataḥ sṛṣṭam idam prabho yat saṁstham yat param yat ca tat tattvam vada tattvataḥ	My dear father, please describe factually the symptoms of this manifest world. What is its background? How is it created? How is it conserved? And under whose control is all this being done?
sarvam hi etat bhavān veda bhūta bhavya bhavat prabhuḥ kara āmalaka vat viśvam vijñāna avasitam tava	My dear father, all this is known to you scientifically because whatever was created in the past, whatever will be created in the future, or whatever is being created at present, as well as everything within the universe, is within your grip, just like a walnut.
yat vijñānaḥ yat ādhāraḥ yat paraḥ tvam yat ātmakaḥ ekaḥ sṛjasi bhūtāni bhūtaiḥ eva ātma māyayā	My dear father, what is the source of your knowledge? Under whose protection are you standing? And under whom are you working? What is your real position? Do you alone create all entities with material elements by your personal energy?
ātman (ātmani) bhāvayase tāni na parābhāvayan svayam ātma śaktim avaṣṭabhya ūrṇa nābhiḥ iva aklamaḥ	As the spider very easily creates the network of its cobweb and manifests its power of creation without being defeated by others, so also you yourself, by employment of your self-sufficient energy, create without any other’s help.
na aham veda param hi asmin na aparam na samam vibho nāma rūpa guṇaiḥ bhāvyam sat asat kiñcit anyataḥ	Whatever we can understand by the nomenclature, characteristics and features of a particular thing — superior, inferior or equal, eternal or temporary — is not created from any source other than that of Your Lordship, thou so great.
saḥ bhavān acarat ghoram yat tapaḥ su samāhitaḥ tena khedayase naḥ tvam parā śaṅkām ca yacchasi	Yet we are moved to wonder about the existence of someone more powerful than you when we think of your great austerities in perfect discipline, although your good self is so powerful in the matter of creation.
etat me pṛcchataḥ sarvam sarva jña sakala īśvara vijānīhi yathā eva idam aham budhye anuśāsitaḥ	My dear father, you know everything, and you are the controller of all. Therefore, may all that I have inquired from you be kindly instructed to me so that I may be able to understand it as your student.
brahmā uvāca samyak kāruṇikasya idam vatsa te vicikitsitam yat aham coditaḥ saumya bhagavat vīrya darśane	Lord Brahmā said: My dear boy Nārada, being merciful to all (including me) you have asked all these questions because I have been inspired to see into the prowess of the Almighty Personality of Godhead.
na anṛtam tava tat ca api yathā mām prabravīṣi bhoḥ avijñāya param mattaḥ etāvat tvam yataḥ hi me	Whatever you have spoken about me is not false because unless and until one is aware of the Personality of Godhead, who is the ultimate truth beyond me, one is sure to be illusioned by observing my powerful activities.
yena sva rociṣā viśvam rocitam rocayāmi aham yathā arkaḥ agniḥ yathā somaḥ yathā ṛkṣa graha tārakāḥ	I create after the Lord’s creation by His personal effulgence [known as the brahmajyoti], just as when the sun manifests its fire, the moon, the firmament, the influential planets and the twinkling stars also manifest their brightness.
tasmai namaḥ bhagavate vāsudevāya dhīmahi yat māyayā durjayayā mām vadanti jagat gurum	I offer my obeisances and meditate upon Lord Kṛṣṇa [Vāsudeva], the Personality of Godhead, whose invincible potency influences them [the less intelligent class of men] to call me the supreme controller.
vilajjamānayā yasya sthātum īkṣā pathe amuyā vimohitāḥ vikatthante mama aham iti durdhiyaḥ	The illusory energy of the Lord cannot take precedence, being ashamed of her position, but those who are bewildered by her always talk nonsense, being absorbed in thoughts of “It is I” and “It is mine.”
dravyam karma ca kālaḥ ca sva bhāvaḥ jīvaḥ eva ca vāsudevāt paraḥ brahman na ca anyaḥ arthaḥ asti tattvataḥ	The five elementary ingredients of creation, the interaction thereof set up by eternal time, and the intuition or nature of the individual living beings are all differentiated parts and parcels of the Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, and in truth there is no other value in them.
nārāyaṇa parāḥ vedāḥ devāḥ nārāyaṇa aṅga jāḥ nārāyaṇa parāḥ lokāḥ nārāyaṇa parāḥ makhāḥ	The Vedic literatures are made by and are meant for the Supreme Lord, the demigods are also meant for serving the Lord as parts of His body, the different planets are also meant for the sake of the Lord, and different sacrifices are performed just to please Him.
nārāyaṇa paraḥ yogaḥ nārāyaṇa param tapaḥ nārāyaṇa param jñānam nārāyaṇa parā gatiḥ	All different types of meditation or mysticism are means for realizing Nārāyaṇa. All austerities are aimed at achieving Nārāyaṇa. Culture of transcendental knowledge is for getting a glimpse of Nārāyaṇa, and ultimately salvation is entering the kingdom of Nārāyaṇa.
tasya api draṣṭuḥ īśasya kūṭa sthasya akhila ātmanaḥ sṛjyam sṛjāmi sṛṣṭaḥ aham īkṣayā eva abhicoditaḥ	Inspired by Him only, I discover what is already created by Him [Nārāyaṇa] under His vision as the all-pervading Supersoul, and I also am created by Him only.
sattvam rajaḥ tamaḥ iti nirguṇasya guṇāḥ trayaḥ sthiti sarga nirodheṣu gṛhītāḥ māyayā vibhoḥ	The Supreme Lord is pure, spiritual form, transcendental to all material qualities, yet for the sake of the creation of the material world and its maintenance and annihilation, He accepts through His external energy the material modes of nature called goodness, passion and ignorance.
kārya kāraṇa kartṛtve dravya jñāna kriyā āśrayāḥ badhnanti nityadā muktam māyinam puruṣam guṇāḥ	These three modes of material nature, being further manifested as matter, knowledge and activities, put the eternally transcendental living entity under conditions of cause and effect and make him responsible for such activities.
saḥ eṣaḥ bhagavān liṅgaiḥ tribhiḥ etaiḥ adhokṣajaḥ su alakṣita gatiḥ brahman sarveṣām mama ca īśvaraḥ	O Brāhmaṇa Nārada, the Superseer, the transcendent Lord, is beyond the perception of the material senses of the living entities because of the above-mentioned three modes of nature. But He is the controller of everyone, including me.
kālam karma svabhāvam ca māyā īśaḥ māyayā svayā ātman (ātmani) yadṛcchayā prāptam vibubhūṣuḥ upādade	The Lord, who is the controller of all energies, thus creates, by His own potency, eternal time, the fate of all living entities, and their particular nature, for which they were created, and He again merges them independently.
kālāt guṇa vyatikaraḥ pariṇāmaḥ svabhāvataḥ karmaṇaḥ janma mahataḥ puruṣa adhiṣṭhitāt abhūt	After the incarnation of the first puruṣa [Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu], the mahat-tattva, or the principles of material creation, take place, and then time is manifested, and in course of time the three qualities appear. Nature means the three qualitative appearances. They transform into activities.
mahataḥ tu vikurvāṇāt rajaḥ sattva upabṛṁhitāt tamaḥ pradhānaḥ tu abhavat dravya jñāna kriyā ātmakaḥ	Material activities are caused by the mahat-tattva’s being agitated. At first there is transformation of the modes of goodness and passion, and later — due to the mode of ignorance — matter, its knowledge, and different activities of material knowledge come into play.
saḥ ahaṅkāraḥ iti proktaḥ vikurvan samabhūt tridhā vaikārikaḥ taijasaḥ ca tāmasaḥ ca iti yat bhidā dravya śaktiḥ kriyā śaktiḥ jñāna śaktiḥ iti prabho	The self-centered materialistic ego, thus being transformed into three features, becomes known as the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance in three divisions, namely the powers that evolve matter, knowledge of material creations, and the intelligence that guides such materialistic activities. Nārada, you are quite competent to understand this.
tāmasāt api bhūta ādeḥ vikurvāṇāt abhūt nabhaḥ tasya mātrā guṇaḥ śabdaḥ liṅgam yat draṣṭṛ dṛśyayoḥ	From the darkness of false ego, the first of the five elements, namely the sky, is generated. Its subtle form is the quality of sound, exactly as the seer is in relationship with the seen.
nabhasaḥ atha vikurvāṇāt abhūt sparśa guṇaḥ anilaḥ para anvayāt śabdavān ca prāṇaḥ ojaḥ sahaḥ balam vāyoḥ api vikurvāṇāt kāla karma svabhāvataḥ udapadyata tejaḥ vai rūpavat sparśa śabdavat tejasaḥ tu vikurvāṇāt āsīt ambhaḥ rasa ātmakam rūpavat sparśavat ca ambhaḥ ghoṣavat ca para anvayāt viśeṣaḥ tu vikurvāṇāt ambhasaḥ gandhavān abhūt para anvayāt rasa sparśa śabda rūpa guṇa anvitaḥ	Because the sky is transformed, the air is generated with the quality of touch, and by previous succession the air is also full of sound and the basic principles of duration of life: sense perception, mental power and bodily strength. When the air is transformed in course of time and nature’s course, fire is generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a manifestation of water, full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of sound. And water, being transformed from all variegatedness on earth, appears odorous and, as previously, becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively.
vaikārikāt manaḥ jajñe devāḥ vaikārikāḥ daśa dik vāta arka pracetaḥ aśvi vahni indra upendra mitra kāḥ	From the mode of goodness the mind is generated and becomes manifest, as also the ten demigods controlling the bodily movements. Such demigods are known as the controller of directions, the controller of air, the sun-god, the father of Dakṣa Prajāpati, the Aśvinī-kumāras, the fire-god, the King of heaven, the worshipable deity in heaven, the chief of the Ādityas, and Brahmājī, the Prajāpati. All come into existence.
taijasāt tu vikurvāṇāt indriyāṇi daśa abhavan jñāna śaktiḥ kriyā śaktiḥ buddhiḥ prāṇaḥ ca taijasau śrotram tvak ghrāṇa dṛk jihvāḥ vāk doḥ meḍhra aṅghri pāyavaḥ	By further transformation of the mode of passion, the sense organs like the ear, skin, nose, eyes, tongue, mouth, hands, genitals, legs, and the outlet for evacuating, together with intelligence and living energy, are all generated.
yadā ete asaṅgatāḥ bhāvāḥ bhūta indriya manaḥ guṇāḥ yadā āyatana nirmāṇe na śekuḥ brahma vit tama	O Nārada, best of the transcendentalists, the forms of the body cannot take place as long as these created parts, namely the elements, senses, mind and modes of nature, are not assembled.
tadā saṁhatya ca anyonyam bhagavat śakti coditāḥ sat asattvam upādāya ca ubhayam sasṛjuḥ hi adaḥ	Thus when all these became assembled by force of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this universe certainly came into being by accepting both the primary and secondary causes of creation.
varṣa pūga sahasra ante tat aṇḍam udake śayam kāla karma svabhāva sthaḥ jīvaḥ ajīvam ajīvayat	Thus all the universes remained thousands of aeons within the water [the Causal Ocean], and the Lord of living beings, entering in each of them, caused them to be fully animated.
saḥ eva puruṣaḥ tasmāt aṇḍam nirbhidya nirgataḥ sahasra ūru aṅghri bāhu akṣaḥ sahasra ānana śīrṣavān	The Lord [Mahā-Viṣṇu], although lying in the Causal Ocean, came out of it, and dividing Himself as Hiraṇyagarbha, He entered into each universe and assumed the virāṭ-rūpa, with thousands of legs, arms, mouths, heads, etc.
yasya iha avayavaiḥ lokān kalpayanti manīṣiṇaḥ kaṭi ādibhiḥ adhaḥ sapta sapta ūrdhvam jaghana ādibhiḥ	Great philosophers imagine that the complete planetary systems in the universe are displays of the different upper and lower limbs of the universal body of the Lord.
puruṣasya mukham brahma kṣatram etasya bāhavaḥ ūrvoḥ vaiśyaḥ bhagavataḥ padbhyām śūdraḥ vyajāyata	The brāhmaṇas represent His mouth, the kṣatriyas His arms, the vaiśyas His thighs, and the śūdras are born of His legs.
bhūḥ lokaḥ kalpitaḥ padbhyām bhuvaḥ lokaḥ asya nābhitaḥ hṛdā svarlokaḥ urasā maharlokaḥ mahā ātmanaḥ	The lower planetary systems, up to the limit of the earthly stratum, are said to be situated in His legs. The middle planetary systems, beginning from Bhuvarloka, are situated in His navel. And the still higher planetary systems, occupied by the demigods and highly cultured sages and saints, are situated in the chest of the Supreme Lord.
grīvāyām janalokaḥ asya tapolokaḥ stana dvayāt mūrdhabhiḥ satyalokaḥ tu brahmalokaḥ sanātanaḥ	From the forefront of the chest up to the neck of the universal form of the Lord are situated the planetary systems named Janaloka and Tapoloka, whereas Satyaloka, the topmost planetary system, is situated on the head of the form. The spiritual planets, however, are eternal.
tat kaṭyām ca atalam kḷptam ūrubhyām vitalam vibhoḥ jānubhyām sutalam śuddham jaṅghābhyām tu talātalam mahātalam tu gulphābhyām prapadābhyām rasātalam pātālam pāda talataḥ iti loka mayaḥ pumān	My dear son Nārada, know from me that there are seven lower planetary systems out of the total fourteen. The first planetary system, known as Atala, is situated on the waist; the second, Vitala, is situated on the thighs; the third, Sutala, on the knees; the fourth, Talātala, on the shanks; the fifth, Mahātala, on the ankles; the sixth, Rasātala, on the upper portion of the feet; and the seventh, Pātāla, on the soles of the feet. Thus the virāṭ form of the Lord is full of all planetary systems.
bhūrlokaḥ kalpitaḥ padbhyām bhuvarlokaḥ asya nābhitaḥ svarlokaḥ kalpitaḥ mūrdhnā iti vā loka kalpanā	Others may divide the whole planetary system into three divisions, namely the lower planetary systems on the legs [up to the earth], the middle planetary systems on the navel, and the upper planetary systems [Svarloka] from the chest to the head of the Supreme Personality.
brahmā uvāca vācām vahneḥ mukham kṣetram chandasām sapta dhātavaḥ havya kavya amṛta annānām jihvā sarva rasasya ca	Lord Brahmā said: The mouth of the virāṭ-puruṣa [the universal form of the Lord] is the generating center of the voice, and the controlling deity is Fire. His skin and six other layers are the generating centers of the Vedic hymns, and His tongue is the productive center of different foodstuffs and delicacies for offering to the demigods, the forefathers and the general mass of people.
sarva asūnām ca vāyoḥ ca tat nāse parama āyaṇe aśvinoḥ oṣadhīnām ca ghrāṇaḥ moda pramodayoḥ	His two nostrils are the generating centers of our breathing and of all other airs, His smelling powers generate the Aśvinī-kumāra demigods and all kinds of medicinal herbs, and His breathing energies produce different kinds of fragrance.
rūpāṇām tejasām cakṣuḥ divaḥ sūryasya ca akṣiṇī karṇau diśām ca tīrthānām śrotram ākāśa śabdayoḥ	His eyes are the generating centers of all kinds of forms, and they glitter and illuminate. His eyeballs are like the sun and the heavenly planets. His ears hear from all sides and are receptacles for all the Vedas, and His sense of hearing is the generating center of the sky and of all kinds of sound.
tat gātram vastu sārāṇām saubhagasya ca bhājanam tvak asya sparśa vāyoḥ ca sarva medhasya ca eva hi	His bodily surface is the breeding ground for the active principles of everything and for all kinds of auspicious opportunities. His skin, like the moving air, is the generating center for all kinds of sense of touch and is the place for performing all kinds of sacrifice.
romāṇi udbhijja jātīnām yaiḥ vā yajñaḥ tu sambhṛtaḥ keśa śmaśru nakhāni asya śilā loha abhra vidyutām	The hairs on His body are the cause of all vegetation, particularly of those trees which are required as ingredients for sacrifice. The hairs on His head and face are reservoirs for the clouds, and His nails are the breeding ground of electricity, stones and iron ores.
bāhavaḥ loka pālānām prāyaśaḥ kṣema karmaṇām	The Lord’s arms are the productive fields for the great demigods and other leaders of the living entities who protect the general mass.
vikramaḥ bhūḥ bhuvaḥ svaḥ ca kṣemasya śaraṇasya ca sarva kāma varasya api hareḥ caraṇaḥ āspadam	Thus the forward steps of the Lord are the shelter for the upper, lower and heavenly planets, as well as for all that we need. His lotus feet serve as protection from all kinds of fear.
apām vīryasya sargasya parjanyasya prajāpateḥ puṁsaḥ śiśnaḥ upasthaḥ tu prajāti ānanda nirvṛteḥ	From the Lord’s genitals originate water, semen, generatives, rains and the procreators. His genitals are the cause of a pleasure that counteracts the distress of begetting.
pāyuḥ yamasya mitrasya parimokṣasya nārada hiṁsāyāḥ nirṛteḥ mṛtyoḥ nirayasya gudam smṛtaḥ	O Nārada, the evacuating outlet of the universal form of the Lord is the abode of the controlling deity of death, Mitra, and the evacuating hole and the rectum of the Lord is the place of envy, misfortune, death, hell, etc.
parābhūteḥ adharmasya tamasaḥ ca api paścimaḥ nāḍyaḥ nada nadīnām ca gotrāṇām asthi saṁhatiḥ	The back of the Lord is the place for all kinds of frustration and ignorance, as well as for immorality. From His veins flow the great rivers and rivulets, and on His bones are stacked the great mountains.
avyakta rasa sindhūnām bhūtānām nidhanasya ca udaram viditam puṁsaḥ hṛdayam manasaḥ padam	The impersonal feature of the Lord is the abode of great oceans, and His belly is the resting place for the materially annihilated living entities. His heart is the abode of the subtle material bodies of living beings. Thus it is known by the intelligent class of men.
dharmasya mama tubhyam ca kumārāṇām bhavasya ca vijñānasya ca sattvasya parasya ātmā parāyaṇam	Also, the consciousness of that great personality is the abode of religious principles — mine, yours, and those of the four bachelors Sanaka, Sanātana, Sanat-kumāra and Sanandana. That consciousness is also the abode of truth and transcendental knowledge.
aham bhavān bhavaḥ ca eva te ime munayaḥ agra jāḥ sura asura narāḥ nāgāḥ khagāḥ mṛga sarīsṛpāḥ gandharva apsarasaḥ, yakṣāḥ, rakṣaḥ bhūta gaṇa uragāḥ, paśavaḥ, pitaraḥ, siddhāḥ, vidyādhrāḥ, cāraṇāḥ drumāḥ anye ca vividhāḥ jīvāḥ jala sthala nabha okasaḥ graha ṛkṣa ketavaḥ tārāḥ taḍitaḥ stanayitnavaḥ sarvam puruṣaḥ eva idam bhūtam bhavyam bhavat ca yat tena idam āvṛtam viśvam vitastim adhitiṣṭhati	Beginning from me [Brahmā] down to you and Bhava [Śiva], all the great sages who were born before you, the demigods, the demons, the Nāgas, the human beings, the birds, the beasts, as well as the reptiles, etc., and all phenomenal manifestations of the universes, namely the planets, stars, asteroids, luminaries, lightning, thunder, and the inhabitants of the different planetary systems, namely the Gandharvas, Apsarās, Yakṣas, Rakṣas, Bhūtagaṇas, Uragas, Paśus, Pitās, Siddhas, Vidyādharas, Cāraṇas, and all other different varieties of living entities, including the birds, beasts, trees and everything that be, are all covered by the universal form of the Lord at all times, namely past, present and future, although He is transcendental to all of them, eternally existing in a form not exceeding nine inches.
sva dhiṣṇyam pratapan prāṇaḥ bahiḥ ca pratapati asau evam virājam pratapan tapati antaḥ bahiḥ pumān	The sun illuminates both internally and externally by expanding its radiation; similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by expanding His universal form, maintains everything in the creation both internally and externally.
saḥ amṛtasya abhayasya īśaḥ martyam annam yat atyagāt mahimā eṣaḥ tataḥ brahman puruṣasya duratyayaḥ	The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the controller of immortality and fearlessness, and He is transcendental to death and the fruitive actions of the material world. O Nārada, O brāhmaṇa, it is therefore difficult to measure the glories of the Supreme Person.
pādeṣu sarva bhūtāni puṁsaḥ sthiti padaḥ viduḥ amṛtam kṣemam abhayam tri mūrdhnaḥ adhāyi mūrdhasu	The Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be known as the supreme reservoir of all material opulences by the one fourth of His energy in which all the living entities exist. Deathlessness, fearlessness and freedom from the anxieties of old age and disease exist in the kingdom of God, which is beyond the three higher planetary systems and beyond the material coverings.
pādāḥ trayaḥ bahiḥ ca āsan aprajānām ye āśramāḥ antaḥ tri lokyāḥ tu aparaḥ gṛha medhaḥ abṛhat vrataḥ	The spiritual world, which consists of three fourths of the Lord’s energy, is situated beyond this material world, and it is especially meant for those who will never be reborn. Others, who are attached to family life and who do not strictly follow celibacy vows, must live within the three material worlds.
sṛtī vicakrame viśvaṅ sāśana anaśane ubhe yat avidyā ca vidyā ca puruṣaḥ tu ubhaya āśrayaḥ	By His energies, the all-pervading Personality of Godhead is thus comprehensively the master in the activities of controlling and in devotional service. He is the ultimate master of both nescience and factual knowledge of all situations.
yasmāt aṇḍam virāṭ jajñe bhūta indriya guṇa ātmakaḥ tat dravyam atyagāt viśvam gobhiḥ sūryaḥ iva ātapan	From that Personality of Godhead, all the universal globes and the universal form with all material elements, qualities and senses are generated. Yet He is aloof from such material manifestations, like the sun, which is separate from its rays and heat.
yadā asya nābhyāt nalināt aham āsam mahā ātmanaḥ na avidam yajña sambhārān puruṣa avayavān ṛte	When I was born from the abdominal lotus flower of the Lord [Mahā-Viṣṇu], the great person, I had no ingredients for sacrificial performances except the bodily limbs of the great Personality of Godhead.
teṣu yajñasya paśavaḥ sa vanaspatayaḥ kuśāḥ idam ca deva yajanam kālaḥ ca uru guṇa anvitaḥ	For performing sacrificial ceremonies, one requires sacrificial ingredients, such as flowers, leaves and straw, along with the sacrificial altar and a suitable time [spring].
vastūni oṣadhayaḥ snehāḥ rasa loha mṛdaḥ jalam ṛcaḥ yajūṁṣi sāmāni cātuḥ hotram ca sattama	Other requirements are utensils, grains, clarified butter, honey, gold, earth, water, the Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda and Sāma Veda and four priests to perform the sacrifice.
nāma dheyāni mantrāḥ ca dakṣiṇāḥ ca vratāni ca devatā anukramaḥ kalpaḥ saṅkalpaḥ tantram eva ca	Other necessities include invoking the different names of the demigods by specific hymns and vows of recompense, in accordance with the particular scripture, for specific purposes and by specific processes.
gatayaḥ matayaḥ ca eva prāyaścittam samarpaṇam puruṣa avayavaiḥ ete sambhārāḥ sambhṛtāḥ mayā	Thus I had to arrange all these necessary ingredients and paraphernalia of sacrifice from the personal bodily parts of the Personality of Godhead. By invocation of the demigods’ names, the ultimate goal, Viṣṇu, was gradually attained, and thus compensation and ultimate offering were complete.
iti sambhṛta sambhāraḥ puruṣa avayavaiḥ aham tam eva puruṣam yajñam tena eva ayajam īśvaram	Thus I created the ingredients and paraphernalia for offering sacrifice out of the parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, the enjoyer of the sacrifice, and I performed the sacrifice to satisfy the Lord.
tataḥ te bhrātaraḥ ime prajānām patayaḥ nava ayajan vyaktam avyaktam puruṣam su samāhitāḥ	My dear son, thereafter your nine brothers, who are the masters of living creatures, performed the sacrifice with proper rituals to satisfy both the manifested and nonmanifested personalities.
tataḥ ca manavaḥ kāle ījire ṛṣayaḥ apare pitaraḥ vibudhāḥ daityāḥ manuṣyāḥ kratubhiḥ vibhum	Thereafter, the Manus, the fathers of mankind, the great sages, the forefathers, the learned scholars, the Daityas and mankind performed sacrifices meant to please the Supreme Lord.
nārāyaṇe bhagavati tat idam viśvam āhitam gṛhīta māyā uru guṇaḥ sarga ādau aguṇaḥ svataḥ	All the material manifestations of the universes are therefore situated in His powerful material energies, which He accepts self-sufficiently, although He is eternally without affinity for the material modes.
sṛjāmi tat niyuktaḥ aham haraḥ harati tat vaśaḥ viśvam puruṣa rūpeṇa paripāti tri śakti dhṛk	By His will, I create, Lord Śiva destroys, and He Himself, in His eternal form as the Personality of Godhead, maintains everything. He is the powerful controller of these three energies.
iti te abhihitam tāta yathā idam anupṛcchasi na anyat bhagavataḥ kiñcit bhāvyam sat asat ātmakam	My dear son, whatever you inquired from me I have thus explained unto you, and you must know for certain that whatever there is (either as cause or as effect, both in the material and spiritual worlds) is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
na bhāratī me aṅga mṛṣā upalakṣyate na vai kvacit me manasaḥ mṛṣā gatiḥ na me hṛṣīkāṇi patanti asat pathe yat me hṛdā autkaṇṭhyavatā dhṛtaḥ hariḥ	O Nārada, because I have caught hold of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, with great zeal, whatever I say has never proved to have been false. Nor is the progress of my mind ever deterred. Nor are my senses ever degraded by temporary attachment to matter.
saḥ aham samāmnāya mayaḥ tapaḥ mayaḥ prajāpatīnām abhivanditaḥ patiḥ āsthāya yogam nipuṇam samāhitaḥ tam na adhyagaccham yataḥ ātma sambhavaḥ	Although I am known as the great Brahmā, perfect in the disciplic succession of Vedic wisdom, and although I have undergone all austerities and am an expert in mystic powers and self-realization, and although I am recognized as such by the great forefathers of the living entities, who offer me respectful obeisances, still I cannot understand Him, the Lord, the very source of my birth.
nataḥ asmi aham tat caraṇam samīyuṣām bhavat chidam svasti ayanam su maṅgalam yaḥ hi ātma māyā vibhavam sma paryagāt yathā nabhaḥ sva antam atha apare kutaḥ	Therefore it is best for me to surrender unto His feet, which alone can deliver one from the miseries of repeated birth and death. Such surrender is all-auspicious and allows one to perceive all happiness. Even the sky cannot estimate the limits of its own expansion. So what can others do when the Lord Himself is unable to estimate His own limits?
na aham na yūyam yat ṛtām gatim viduḥ na vāmadevaḥ kim uta apare surāḥ tat māyayā mohita buddhayaḥ tu idam vinirmitam ca ātma samam vicakṣmahe	Since neither Lord Śiva nor you nor I could ascertain the limits of spiritual happiness, how can other demigods know it? And because all of us are bewildered by the illusory, external energy of the Supreme Lord, we can see only this manifested cosmos according to our individual ability.
yasya avatāra karmāṇi gāyanti hi asmat ādayaḥ na yam vidanti tattvena tasmai bhagavate namaḥ	Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose incarnations and activities are chanted by us for glorification, though He can hardly be fully known as He is.
saḥ eṣaḥ ādyaḥ puruṣaḥ kalpe kalpe sṛjati ajaḥ ātmā ātmani ātmanā ātmānam saḥ saṁyacchati pāti ca	That supreme original Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, expanding His plenary portion as Mahā-Viṣṇu, the first incarnation, creates this manifested cosmos, but He is unborn. The creation, however, takes place in Him, and the material substance and manifestations are all Himself. He maintains them for some time and absorbs them into Himself again.
viśuddham kevalam jñānam pratyak samyak avasthitam satyam pūrṇam anādi antam nirguṇam nityam advayam ṛṣe vidanti munayaḥ praśānta ātma indriya āśayāḥ yadā tat eva asat tarkaiḥ tiraḥ dhīyeta viplutam	The Personality of Godhead is pure, being free from all contaminations of material tinges. He is the Absolute Truth and the embodiment of full and perfect knowledge. He is all-pervading, without beginning or end, and without rival. O Nārada, O great sage, the great thinkers can know Him when completely freed from all material hankerings and when sheltered under undisturbed conditions of the senses. Otherwise, by untenable arguments, all is distorted, and the Lord disappears from our sight.
ādyaḥ avatāraḥ puruṣaḥ parasya kālaḥ svabhāvaḥ sat asat manaḥ ca dravyam vikāraḥ guṇaḥ indriyāṇi virāṭ svarāṭ sthāsnu cariṣṇu bhūmnaḥ	Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu is the first incarnation of the Supreme Lord, and He is the master of eternal time, space, cause and effects, mind, the elements, the material ego, the modes of nature, the senses, the universal form of the Lord, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, and the sum total of all living beings, both moving and nonmoving.
aham bhavaḥ yajñaḥ ime prajā īśāḥ dakṣa ādayaḥ ye bhavat ādayaḥ ca svarloka pālāḥ khagaloka pālāḥ nṛloka pālāḥ talaloka pālāḥ gandharva vidyādhara cāraṇa īśāḥ ye yakṣa rakṣa uraga nāga nāthāḥ ye vā ṛṣīṇām ṛṣabhāḥ pitṝṇām daitya indra siddha īśvara dānava indrāḥ anye ca ye preta piśāca bhūta kūṣmāṇḍa yādaḥ mṛga pakṣi adhīśāḥ yat kim ca loke bhagavat mahasvat ojaḥ sahasvat balavat kṣamāvat śrī hrī vibhūti ātmavat adbhuta arṇam tattvam param rūpavat asva rūpam	I myself [Brahmā], Lord Śiva, Lord Viṣṇu, great generators of living beings like Dakṣa and Prajāpati, yourselves [Nārada and the Kumāras], heavenly demigods like Indra and Candra, the leaders of the Bhūrloka planets, the leaders of the earthly planets, the leaders of the lower planets, the leaders of the Gandharva planets, the leaders of the Vidyādhara planets, the leaders of the Cāraṇaloka planets, the leaders of the Yakṣas, Rakṣas and Uragas, the great sages, the great demons, the great atheists and the great spacemen, as well as the dead bodies, evil spirits, satans, jinn, kūṣmāṇḍas, great aquatics, great beasts and great birds, etc. — in other words, anything and everything which is exceptionally possessed of power, opulence, mental and perceptual dexterity, strength, forgiveness, beauty, modesty, opulence, and breeding, whether in form or formless — may appear to be the specific truth and the form of the Lord, but actually they are not so. They are only a fragment of the transcendental potency of the Lord.
prādhānyataḥ yān ṛṣe āmananti līlā avatārān puruṣasya bhūmnaḥ āpīyatām karṇa kaṣāya śoṣān anukramiṣye te imān su peśān	O Nārada, now I shall state, one after another, the transcendental incarnations of the Lord known as līlā-avatāras. Hearing of their activities counteracts all foul matters accumulated in the ear. These pastimes are pleasing to hear and are to be relished. Therefore they are in my heart.
brahmā uvāca yatra udyataḥ kṣiti tala uddharaṇāya bibhrat krauḍīm tanum sakala yajña mayīm anantaḥ antar mahā arṇave upāgatam ādi daityam tam daṁṣṭrayā adrim iva vajra dharaḥ dadāra	Lord Brahmā said: When the unlimitedly powerful Lord assumed the form of a boar as a pastime, just to lift the planet earth, which was drowned in the great ocean of the universe called the Garbhodaka, the first demon [Hiraṇyākṣa] appeared, and the Lord pierced him with His tusk.
jātaḥ ruceḥ ajanayat suyamān suyajñaḥ ākūti sūnuḥ amarān atha dakṣiṇāyām loka trayasya mahatīm aharat yat ārtim svāyambhuvena manunā hariḥ iti anūktaḥ	The Prajāpati first begot Suyajña in the womb of his wife Ākūti, and then Suyajña begot demigods, headed by Suyama, in the womb of his wife Dakṣiṇā. Suyajña, as the Indradeva, diminished very great miseries in the three planetary systems [upper, lower and intermediate], and because he so diminished the miseries of the universe, he was later called Hari by the great father of mankind, namely Svāyambhuva Manu.
jajñe ca kardama gṛhe dvija devahūtyām strībhiḥ samam navabhiḥ ātma gatim sva mātre ūce yayā ātma śamalam guṇa saṅga paṅkam asmin vidhūya kapilasya gatim prapede	The Lord then appeared as the Kapila incarnation, being the son of the prajāpati brāhmaṇa Kardama and his wife, Devahūti, along with nine other women [sisters]. He spoke to His mother about self-realization, by which, in that very lifetime, she became fully cleansed of the mud of the material modes and thereby achieved liberation, the path of Kapila.
atreḥ apatyam abhikāṅkṣataḥ āha tuṣṭaḥ dattaḥ mayā aham iti yat bhagavān saḥ dattaḥ yat pāda paṅkaja parāga pavitra dehāḥ yoga ṛddhim āpuḥ ubhayīm yadu haihaya ādyāḥ	The great sage Atri prayed for offspring, and the Lord, being satisfied with him, promised to incarnate as Atri’s son, Dattātreya [Datta, the son of Atri]. And by the grace of the lotus feet of the Lord, many Yadus, Haihayas, etc., became so purified that they obtained both material and spiritual blessings.
taptam tapaḥ vividha loka sisṛkṣayā me ādau sanāt sva tapasaḥ saḥ catuḥ sanaḥ abhūt prāk kalpa samplava vinaṣṭam iha ātma tattvam samyak jagāda munayaḥ yat acakṣata ātman	To create different planetary systems I had to undergo austerities and penance, and the Lord, thus being pleased with me, incarnated in four sanas [Sanaka, Sanatkumāra, Sanandana and Sanātana]. In the previous creation the spiritual truth was devastated, but the four sanas explained it so nicely that the truth at once became clearly perceived by the sages.
dharmasya dakṣa duhitari ajaniṣṭa mūrtyām nārāyaṇaḥ naraḥ iti sva tapaḥ prabhāvaḥ dṛṣṭvā ātmanaḥ bhagavataḥ niyama avalopam devyaḥ tu anaṅga pṛtanāḥ ghaṭitum na śekuḥ	To exhibit His personal way of austerity and penance, He appeared in twin forms as Nārāyaṇa and Nara in the womb of Mūrti, the wife of Dharma and the daughter of Dakṣa. Celestial beauties, the companions of Cupid, went to try to break His vows, but they were unsuccessful, for they saw that many beauties like them were emanating from Him, the Personality of Godhead.
kāmam dahanti kṛtinaḥ nanu roṣa dṛṣṭyā roṣam dahantam uta te na dahanti asahyam saḥ ayam yat antaram alam praviśan bibheti kāmaḥ katham nu punaḥ asya manaḥ śrayeta	Great stalwarts like Lord Śiva can, by their wrathful glances, overcome lust and vanquish him, yet they cannot be free from the overwhelming effects of their own wrath. Such wrath can never enter into the heart of Him [the Lord], who is above all this. So how can lust take shelter in His mind?
viddhaḥ sapatni udita patribhiḥ anti rājñaḥ bālaḥ api san upagataḥ tapase vanāni tasmai adāt dhruva gatim gṛṇate prasannaḥ divyāḥ stuvanti munayaḥ yat upari adhastāt	Being insulted by sharp words spoken by the co-wife of the king, even in his presence, Prince Dhruva, though only a boy, took to severe penances in the forest. And the Lord, being satisfied by his prayer, awarded him the Dhruva planet, which is worshiped by great sages, both upward and downward.
yat venam utpatha gatam dvija vākya vajra niṣpluṣṭa pauruṣa bhagam niraye patantam trātvā arthitaḥ jagati putra padam ca lebhe dugdhā vasūni vasudhā sakalāni yena	Mahārāja Vena went astray from the path of righteousness, and the brāhmaṇas chastised him by the thunderbolt curse. By this King Vena was burnt with his good deeds and opulence and was en route to hell. The Lord, by His causeless mercy, descended as his son, by the name of Pṛthu, delivered the condemned King Vena from hell, and exploited the earth by drawing all kinds of crops as produce.
nābheḥ asau ṛṣabhaḥ āsa sudevi sūnuḥ yaḥ vai cacāra sama dṛk jaḍa yoga caryām yat pāramahaṁsyam ṛṣayaḥ padam āmananti svasthaḥ praśānta karaṇaḥ parimukta saṅgaḥ	The Lord appeared as the son of Sudevī, the wife of King Nābhi, and was known as Ṛṣabhadeva. He performed materialistic yoga to equibalance the mind. This stage is also accepted as the highest perfectional situation of liberation, wherein one is situated in one’s self and is completely satisfied.
satre mama āsa bhagavān haya śīraṣā atha sākṣāt saḥ yajña puruṣaḥ tapanīya varṇaḥ chandaḥ mayaḥ makha mayaḥ akhila devatā ātmā vācaḥ babhūvuḥ uśatīḥ śvasataḥ asya nastaḥ	The Lord appeared as the Hayagrīva incarnation in a sacrifice performed by me [Brahmā]. He is the personified sacrifices, and the hue of His body is golden. He is the personified Vedas as well, and the Supersoul of all demigods. When He breathed, all the sweet sounds of the Vedic hymns came out of His nostrils.
matsyaḥ yuga anta samaye manunā upalabdhaḥ kṣoṇīmayaḥ nikhila jīva nikāya ketaḥ visraṁsitān uru bhaye salile mukhāt me ādāya tatra vijahāra ha veda mārgān	At the end of the millennium, the would-be Vaivasvata Manu, of the name Satyavrata, would see that the Lord in the fish incarnation is the shelter of all kinds of living entities, up to those in the earthly planets. Because of my fear of the vast water at the end of the millennium, the Vedas come out of my [Brahmā’s] mouth, and the Lord enjoys those vast waters and protects the Vedas.
kṣīra udadhau amara dānava yūtha pānām unmathnatām amṛta labdhaya ādi devaḥ pṛṣṭhena kacchapa vapuḥ vidadhāra gotram nidrākṣaṇaḥ adri parivarta kaṣāṇa kaṇḍūḥ	The primeval Lord then assumed the tortoise incarnation in order to serve as a resting place [pivot] for the Mandara Mountain, which was acting as a churning rod. The demigods and demons were churning the Ocean of Milk with the Mandara Mountain in order to extract nectar. The mountain moved back and forth, scratching the back of Lord Tortoise, who, while partially sleeping, was experiencing an itching sensation.
trai piṣṭapa uru bhaya hā saḥ nṛsiṁha rūpam kṛtvā bhramat bhru kuṭi daṁṣṭra karāla vaktram daitya indram āśu gadayā abhipatantam ārāt ūrau nipātya vidadāra nakhaiḥ sphurantam	The Personality of Godhead assumed the incarnation of Nṛsiṁhadeva in order to vanquish the great fears of the demigods. He killed the king of the demons [Hiraṇyakaśipu], who challenged the Lord with a club in his hand, by placing the demon on His thighs and piercing him with His nails, rolling His eyebrows in anger and showing His fearful teeth and mouth.
antaḥ sarasi uru balena pade gṛhītaḥ grāheṇa yūtha patiḥ ambuja hastaḥ ārtaḥ āha idam ādi puruṣa akhila loka nātha tīrtha śravaḥ śravaṇa maṅgala nāma dheya	The leader of the elephants, whose leg was attacked in a river by a crocodile of superior strength, was much aggrieved. Taking a lotus flower in his trunk, he addressed the Lord, saying, “O original enjoyer, Lord of the universe! O deliverer, as famous as a place of pilgrimage! All are purified simply by hearing Your holy name, which is worthy to be chanted.”
śrutvā hariḥ tam araṇa arthinam aprameyaḥ cakra āyudhaḥ pataga rāja bhuja adhirūḍhaḥ cakreṇa nakra vadanam vinipāṭya tasmāt haste pragṛhya bhagavān kṛpayā ujjahāra	The Personality of Godhead, after hearing the elephant’s plea, felt that the elephant needed His immediate help, for he was in great distress. Thus at once the Lord appeared there on the wings of the king of birds, Garuḍa, fully equipped with His weapon, the wheel [cakra]. With the wheel He cut to pieces the mouth of the crocodile to save the elephant, and He delivered the elephant by lifting him by his trunk.
jyāyān guṇaiḥ avarajaḥ api aditeḥ sutānām lokān vicakrame imān yat atha adhiyajñaḥ kṣmām vāmanena jagṛhe tripada chalena yācñām ṛte pathi caran prabhubhiḥ na cālyaḥ	The Lord, although transcendental to all material modes, still surpassed all the qualities of the sons of Aditi, known as the Ādityas. The Lord appeared as the youngest son of Aditi. And because He surpassed all the planets of the universe, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. On the pretense of asking for a measurement of three footsteps of land, He took away all the lands of Bali Mahārāja. He asked simply because without begging, no authority can take one’s rightful possession.
na arthaḥ baleḥ ayam urukrama pāda śaucam āpaḥ śikhā dhṛtavataḥ vibudha adhipatyam yaḥ vai pratiśrutam ṛte na cikīrṣat anyat ātmānam aṅga manasā haraye abhimene	Bali Mahārāja, who put on his head the water washed from the lotus feet of the Lord, did not think of anything besides his promise, in spite of being forbidden by his spiritual master. The king dedicated his own personal body to fulfill the measurement of the Lord’s third step. For such a personality, even the kingdom of heaven, which he conquered by his strength, was of no value.
tubhyam ca nārada bhṛśam bhagavān vivṛddha bhāvena sādhu parituṣṭaḥ uvāca yogam jñānam ca bhāgavatam ātma sa tattva dīpam yat vāsudeva śaraṇāḥ viduḥ añjasā eva	O Nārada, you were taught about the science of God and His transcendental loving service by the Personality of Godhead in His incarnation of Haṁsāvatāra. He was very much pleased with you, due to your intense proportion of devotional service. He also explained unto you, lucidly, the full science of devotional service, which is especially understandable by persons who are souls surrendered unto Lord Vāsudeva, the Personality of Godhead.
cakram ca dikṣu avihatam daśasu sva tejaḥ manvantareṣu manu vaṁśa dharaḥ bibharti duṣṭeṣu rājasu damam vyadadhāt sva kīrtim satye tri pṛṣṭhe uśatīm prathayan caritraiḥ	As the incarnation of Manu, the Lord became the descendant of the Manu dynasty and ruled over the miscreant kingly order, subduing them by His powerful wheel weapon. Undeterred in all circumstances, His rule was characterized by His glorious fame, which spread over the three lokas, and above them to the planetary system of Satyaloka, the topmost in the universe.
dhanvantariḥ ca bhagavān svayam eva kīrtiḥ nāmnā nṛṇām puru rujām rujaḥ āśu hanti yajñe ca bhāgam amṛta āyuḥ ava avarundhe āyuṣya vedam anuśāsti avatīrya loke	The Lord in His incarnation of Dhanvantari very quickly cures the diseases of the ever-diseased living entities simply by His fame personified, and only because of Him do the demigods achieve long lives. Thus the Personality of Godhead becomes ever glorified. He also exacted a share from the sacrifices, and it is he only who inaugurated the medical science or the knowledge of medicine in the universe.
kṣatram kṣayāya vidhinā upabhṛtam mahātmā brahma dhruk ujjhita patham naraka ārti lipsu uddhanti asau avanikaṇṭakam ugra vīryaḥ triḥ sapta kṛtvaḥ urudhāra paraśvadhena	When the ruling administrators, who are known as the kṣatriyas, turned astray from the path of the Absolute Truth, being desirous to suffer in hell, the Lord, in His incarnation as the sage Paraśurāma, uprooted those unwanted kings, who appeared as the thorns of the earth. Thus He thrice seven times uprooted the kṣatriyas with His keenly sharpened chopper.
