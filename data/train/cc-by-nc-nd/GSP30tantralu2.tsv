I bow to the flash of consciousness, the consort of Bhairava, the Divine Mother who has assumed the form of the spokes of the wheel of creation as also of the petals of the lotus of the essential constitution of the individual. I also bow to the bodily divinity i.e. the kuṇḍalini of the shape of the dancing Siva delighting in the form of the lightning in the midst of the cloud of the rainy season.
dīptajyotiśchaṭāpluṣṭabhedabandhatrayaṃ sphurat | stājjñānaśalaṃ satpakṣavipakṣotkartanakṣamam |	May the barb of knowledge getting manifested with its luminosity be capable of eliminating the three bonds of subjectivity, objectivity and doubt.

May they remain constant in manifesting my transcendent Self. May that son of the Goddess, namely, Ganeśa, being adorned with the highly luminous rays of the gods and hence having become the sole Lord of the entire circle of creation effulgent with the luminosity of the full moon bring vibration to the sea of my consciousness. Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...

May the venture of those initial teachers of the three streams of Tryambaka's school attain fulfilment who acted as sailors of the boat on the turbulent ocean effulgent with waves.

śrīsomānandabodhaśrīmadutpalaviniḥsṛtāḥ| jayanti saṃvidāmodasandarbhā dikprasarpiṇaḥ |	We also bow to Śri Utpaladeva who is born of the understanding ofŚrīSomānanda as the fragrance of the lotus grown out of the ocean of his knowledge and has spread in all directions.
tadāsvādabharāveśabṛṃhitāṃ matiṣaṭapadīm | gurorlakṣmaṇaguptasya nādasaṃmohinīṃ numaḥ |	We bow to the wisdom of our teacher Laksmanagupta which as the honeybee has become delighted by the good smell of it as the lotus. NOTE: Laksmanagupta is the name of the son of Utpaladeva as also of one of his students.
yaḥ pūrṇānandaviśrāntasarvaśāstrārthapāragaḥ| sa śrīcukhulako diśyādiṣṭaṃ me gururuttamaḥ |	My best teacher has been my father named popularly as Śrī Cukhulaka who had crossed the ocean of all the streams of learning and was resting completely in its delight.

This wisdom has emerged from the effort to remove the poison of traps of ignorance of other wrong ways of redemption as being propounded by Abhinavagupta herewith is blemishless.
na tadastīha yanna śrīmālinīvijayottare | devadevena nirdiṣṭaṃ svaśabdenātha liṅgataḥ |	There is nothing here which is not there in the Mālinivijayottara, stated explicitly or indicated suggestively by the God of gods Himself.
daśāṣṭādaśavasvaṣṭabhinnaṃ yacchāsanaṃ vibhoḥ | tatsāraṃ trikaśāstraṃ hi tatsāraṃ mālinīmatam |	The empire of the Lord extending to ten states of Himself, eighteen those of Rudra and eight of the Vasus are summed up in the Trika Sāstra whose essence lies compressed in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra.
ato'trāntargataṃ sarvaṃ saṃpradāyojjhitairbudhaiḥ | adṛṣṭaṃ prakaṭīkurmo gurunāthājñayā vayam |	Therefore, herewith we are going to reveal all those items which were left out by those wise scholars who had either opted out of the School or were unable to see, by the permission of our teacher.

Pick up this lotus flower in the form of the heart of Abhinavagupta which has bloomed owing to the touch of the feet of Sri Sambhunātha like the rays of the sun falling on it for the sake of the worship of the Supreme Divine Being.
iha tāvatsamasteṣu śāstreṣu parigīyate | ajñānaṃ saṃsṛterheturjñānaṃ mokṣaikakāraṇam |	It has been pronounced by all the scriptures uniformly that ignorance is the cause of rebirth in the circle of creation while knowledge is the sole cause of redemption.
malamajñānamicchanti saṃsārāṅkurakāraṇam | iti proktaṃ tathā ca śrīmālinīvijayottare |	a Ignorance is a malice which people choose for the cropping up of the sprout of worldliness. This has been pronounced in Mālinivijayottara Tantra.
viśeṣaṇena buddhisthe saṃsārottarakālike | saṃbhāvanā nirasyaitadabhāve mokṣamabravīt |	On elimination of the ignorance accumulated specially in the body which is destined to fructify in future, it is said that there is the possibility of liberation.
ajñānamiti na jñānābhāvaścātiprasaṅgataḥ| sa hi loṣṭādike'pyasti na ca tasyāsti saṃsṛtiḥ |	Ignorance is not merely absence of knowledge, for, admittance, as such even a clod would have to be covered by the definition of the knowledgeable as it too does not have to move in the circle of birth and death.
ato jñeyasya tattvasya sāmastyenāprathātmakam | jñānameva tadajñānaṃ śivasūtreṣu bhāṣitam |	Therefore, jñāna, knowledge, means that state of understanding in which what is to be known is understood in its entirety, leaving no scope for any extension Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...
caitanyamātmā jñānaṃ ca bandha ityatra sūtrayoḥ | saṃśleṣetarayogābhyāmayamarthaḥ pradarśitaḥ | caitanyamiti bhāvāntaḥ śabdasvātantryamātrakam | anākṣiptaviśeṣaṃ sadāha sūtre purātane | dvitīyena tu sūtreṇa kriyāṃ vā karaṇaṃ ca vā| bruvatā tasya cinmātrarūpasya dvaitamucyate |	In the first and second aphorisms of the treatise Siva-Sutra, there is the possibility of a twofold interpretation, i.e., 'Consciousness is the Self' and 'Knowledge is the bondage'. There is the possibility of a twofold interpretation, i.e., 'consciousness is the Self' and 'Knowledge as ignorance is bondage' depending on whether the sūtras are read conjointly or separately. The word ‘caitanya' as an abstract noun expressive of the self-sufficience of consciousness in itself as an entity in the first one of the aphorisms while in the second it is expressive of its creativity or / and being means of action and hence the duality of it.
dvaitaprathā tadajñānaṃ tucchatvād bandha ucyate| tata eva samucchedyamityāvṛttyā nirūpitam |	Wherever there is duality, there is ignorance. Hence there is scarcity and therefore needs to be eliminated. This is the purpose behind the repetition of the aphorism.
svatantrātmātiriktastu tuccho'tuccho'pi kaścana | na mokṣo nāma tannāsya pṛthaṅnāmāpi gṛhyate | |	- Finite or infinite whatever, if other than the independent, cannot be regarded as the state of liberation, no matter whatever other denomination be given to it.
rāgādyakaluṣo'smyantaḥ śūnyo'haṃ kartṛtojjhitaḥ | itthaṃ samāsavyāsābhyāṃ jñānaṃ muñcati tāvataḥ | tasmānmukto'pyavacchedādavacchedāntarasthiteḥ| amukta eva muktastu sarvāvacchedavarjitaḥ |	Sri Tantrāloka As against the contention of the Buddhists that there is a gradation in the range of the status of liberation in the form of the states of perfection depending on the nearer we move to it the higher we attain the state of peace in the world, the author proposes as follows : “Now I have become free of the contamination by attachment, etc., and thus have become free from the sense of doership and hence both collectively as well as severally I have become redeemed of the sense of doership gradually to the same extent, as the higher and still higher state is attained, this is how Buddhists, etc., think of liberation." In view of this, in these systerns, the liberated one is no more than liberated in parts and by no means completely since only he can be regarded as liberated who is rid of all limitations.
yattu jñeyasatattvasya jñānaṃ sarvātmanojjhitam | avacchedairna tatkutrāpyajñānaṃ satyamuktidam |	The state in which the knowledge of the Reality worth knowing has not been acquired in itsentirety, understanding in mere parts cannot be said to be complete. Incomplete understanding cannot impart anyone true liberation.
nānājñānasvarūpaṃ yaduktaṃ pratyekamapyadaḥ | dvidhā pauruṣabauddhatvabhidoktaṃ śivaśāsane | |	What has been stated as various kinds of knowledge and ignorance, out of the personal and intellectual, each one of the Paurusa and Bauddha, is of both the varieties in the discipline of Saivism.
tatra puṃso yadajñānaṃ malākhyaṃ tajjamapyathā | |	There, too, the ignorance of the person is known as mala, as it covers the Siva- hood of the citta.
svapūrṇacitkriyārūpaśivatāvaraṇātmakam saṃkocidṛkkriyārūpaṃ tatpaśoravikalpitam | tadajñānaṃ na buddhaṃśo'dhyavasāyādyabhāvataḥ |	It brings contraction to both Siva-hood of the jiva and his actions and reduces him to mere animality. -a Animality becomes the innate nature of the individual. Such an ignorance is not any function of the intellect as the latter is of the nature of contemplation.
ahamitthamidaṃ vedmītyevamadhyavasāyinī| ṣaṭkañcukābilāṇūtthapratibimbanato yadā | dhīrjāyate tadā tādṛgjñānamajñānaśabditam | bauddhaṃ tasya ca tatpauṃsnaṃ poṣaṇīyaṃ ca poṣṭaca |	b ‘I know this in this form', this is the format of our understanding involving the sixfolds of disguise reflected through which the inmost consciousness brings in the awareness, dhi, which is worded as knowledge of the intellectual sort and of personal nature. It is taken as the outcome as well as servient to the instrument of intellection. - NOTE: I. The sixfold disguises are time, partition, destiny, attachment, delusion and ignorance.
kṣīṇe tu paśusaṃskāre puṃsaḥ prāptaparasthiteḥ | vikasvaraṃ tadvijñānaṃ pauruṣaṃ nirvikalpakam |	Sri Tantrāloka On emergence of the higher state of understanding in the person concerned following elimination of the state of animality in him blooms the self-knowledge which is real since it is unaffected by the limiting adjuncts of the disguises.
vikasvarāvikalpātmajñānaucityena yāvatā | taddbauddhaṃ yasya tatpauṃsnaṃ prāgvatpoṣyaṃ ca poṣṭa ca | |	Pure intellectual knowledge is that which is rid of the six adjuncts of the disguises and options and has emerged out of the Self. It is personal. It is both the ultimate support of all knowledge as well as the fruit of all knowledge.
tatra dīkṣādinā pauṃsnamajñānaṃ dhvaṃsi yadyapi | tathāpi taccharīrānte tajjñānaṃ vyajyate sphuṭam |	Though the personal ignorance gets eliminated on account of initiation, etc. imparted by a worthy teacher, the real knowledge imparted by him bears fruits tangibly on redemption from the present body.
bauddhajñānena tu yadā bauddhamajñānajṛmbhitam | vilīyate tadā jīvanmukti karatale sthitā |	With the elimination of the intellectual ignorance by means of pure intellectual knowledge, the initiate gets redeemed immediately, as if, redemption from life was waiting for the occasion close to his hand.
dīkṣāpi bauddhavijñānapūrvā satyaṃ vimocikā | tena tatrāpi bauddhasya jñānasyāsti pradhānatā |	Thus, in the redemption of such cases what is of prime importance is the conversancy in the pure intellectual exercise. Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...
jñānājñānagataṃ caitadvitvaṃ svāyambhuve rurau | mataṅgādau kṛtaṃ śrīmatkheṭapālādidaiśikaiḥ | tathāvidhāvasāyātmabauddhavijñānasampade | śāstrameva pradhānaṃ yajjñeyatattvapradarśakam |	This duality of knowledge and ignorance has been discussed in other schools of Saivism such as Ruru and Matanga by authorities like Khetrapāla and others. The śaiva scripture is the paramount factor in the elision of the sense of duality between the Self and the Ultimate Reality, that is, Siva by virtue of directing one to the vision of this sense of oneness between the two apparently poles apart from each other .
dīkṣayā galite'pyantarajñāne pauruṣātmani | dhīgatasyānivṛttatvādvikalpo'pi hi saṃbhaveta | | dehasadbhāvaparyantamātmabhāvo yato dhiyi | dehānte'pi na mokṣaḥ syātpauruṣājñānahānitaḥ |	Since the sense of Self lurks in the psyche well until the fall of the body, it is quite probable that one may not get redeemed even after one's death on account of the inherent personal ignorance still lying embedded there. In case of the removal of the inherent intellectual ignorance by virtue of elimination of the option decidedly, one has the surety of redemption then and there immediately.
bauddhājñānanivṛttau tu vikalponmūlanād dhruvam| tadaiva mokṣa ityuktaṃ dhātrā śrīmanniśāṭane | vikalpayuktacittastu piṇḍapātācchivaṃ vrajet | itarastu tadaiveti śāstrasyātra pradhāānataḥ | jñeyasya hi paraṃ tattvaṃ yaḥ prakāśātmakaḥ śivaḥ nahyaprakāśarūpasya prākāśyaṃ vastutāpi vā |	This has been stated by the author towards the end of the Niśātana text. Thus the individual psyche still remaining clouded by the option of the sense of duality may have to wait for access to Siva until the fall of his body while the other one i.e., one who has got his sense of duality completely removed even from his inner being through comprehension of the core of the philosophy has the surety of reaching Him then and there without having to wait for the fall of the body. The supreme essence of the knowledgeable is that whatever is known, is known due to the illumination of Śiva since He is the illuminator of all.
avastutāpi bhāvānāṃ camatkāraikagocarā | yatkuḍyasadṛśī neyaṃ dhīravastvetadityapi |	Even understanding of the non-existence of things is a wonderful experience. The cognisance of the non-existence of the pitcher at a certain place is unlike the cognisance of it which is divine.
prakāśo nāma yaścāyaṃ sarvatraiva prakāśate | anapahnavanīyatvāt kiṃ tasminmānakalpanaiḥ |	This Light of consciousness remains luminous everywhere on account of its irrepressibility. This is why there is no necessity of adducing any proof in regard to it.
pramāṇānyapi vastūnāṃ jīvitaṃ yāni tanvate | teṣāmapi paro jīvaḥ sa eva parameśvaraḥ |	The agent of life jiva lies above the agent serving as the source of proofs for the being of things whatever. As such, the same is the Supreme Being.
sarvā hnavahevākadharmāpyevaṃ hi vartate | jñānamātmārthamityetanneti māṃ prati bhāsate |	Negation of everything as Śūnyavādin Buddhists have done is a gamble inasmuch as it implies admittance of the positivity of the support of all. Knowledge always remains self-centric.
apahanutau sādhane vā vastūnāmādyamīdṛśam | yattatra ke pramāṇānāmupapattyupayogite | kāmike tata evoktaṃ hetuvādavivarjitam | tasya devātidevasya parāpekṣā na vidyate |	Irrespective of the fact whether it be the case of denial of the being of everything or of admittance, the point in both the cases is that the beginning is rather inexplicable. In such a state of things, what may be the proofs on either side and their utility? The same has been stated in the Kāmika Tantra also, however, without taking recourse to any argument amounting to the assertion that the Over Lord does not need anyone or anything else to depend on.
parasya tadapekṣatvātsvatantro'yamataḥ sthitaḥ | anapekṣasya vāśino deśakālākṛtikṛtikramāḥ | niyatā neti sa vibhurnityo viśvākṛtiḥ śivaḥ| vibhutvātsarvago nityabhāvādādyantavarjitaḥ |	On the contrary as everything else has the necessity of presupposition of His being as the Transcendent and autonomous, space, time, forms and processes are dependent on Him. Due to absence of the limitations of space, time, form and processes, etc., in Him, He is all-pervading, eternal and omni-form. Due to being omnipresent, He is all-pervading while on account of being eternal, He is rid of beginning and end.
viśvākṛtitvāccidacittadvaicitryāvabhāsakaḥ |	On account of being omni-form, He is illuminator of the entire diversity of the conscient and inconscient in the world.
tato'sya bahurūpatvamuktaṃ dīkṣottarādike |	- This is why it is said in the sequel of the initiation that Siva is of multiforms.
bhuvanaṃ vigraho jyotiḥ khaṃ śabdo mantra eva ca| bindunādādisaṃbhinnaḥ ṣaḍvidhaḥ śiva ucyate | | yo yadātmakatāniṣṭhastadbhāvaṃ sa prapadyate | vyomādiśabdavijñānātparo mokṣo na saṃśayaḥ |	Six are the varieties of the multiplicity of His forms. These are related to the region, form, light, space, word and mantra divided again into the forms of point and sound, etc. - Depending on the aspirant's aptitude to get himself identified with anyone of the six forms of Śiva, as mentioned in the previous verse, he gets undoubtedly transformed into that state of liberation.
viśvākṛtitve devasya tadetaccopalakṣaṇam| anavacchinnatārūḍhāvavacchedalaye'sya ca |	Since the Lord Śiva is of universal form, the above kind of transformation in the destiny of His aspirant is just indicatory of his access to the state of infinity following the breakage of limitations.
uktaṃ ca kāmike devaḥ sarvākṛtinirākṛtiḥ | jaladarpaṇavattena sarvaṃ vyāptaṃ carācaram |	In the Kāmika Tantra, it has been stated that the Lord is omniform as well as transcendent to all forms. His relationship to forms is kindred to that between the water and the mirror and thus is indicatory of His pervasion of the entire world both mobile and immobile.
na cāsya vibhutādyo'yaṃ dharmo'nyonyaṃ vibhidyate | eka evāsya dharmo'sau sarvākṣepeṇa vartate |	His quality of omniformity, etc., is no way different from Himself. His one and the same quality is assumptive of all forms.
tena svātantryaśaktyaiva yukta ityāñjaso vidhiḥ | bahuśaktitvamapyasya tacchaktyaivāviyuktatā |	The shortest way to the understanding of Him is to say that in all matters He exercises His power of autonomy. Multiplicity of His powerfulness also is included in this exercise of autonomy.
śaktiśca nāma bhāvasya svaṃ rūpaṃ mātṛkalpitam| tenādvayaḥ sa evāpi śaktimatparikalpane | |	Force of any entity is the self-power of itself conceived by its knower. By virtue of this fact the entity concerned is conceived as possessed of that force.
mātṛklṛpte hi devasya tatra tatra vapuṣyalam | ko bhedo vastuto vaherdagdhṛpaktṛtvayoriva | na cāsau paramārthena na kiṃcidbhāsanādṛte | nahyasti kiṃcittacchaktitadvadbhedo'pi vāstavaḥ |	Whatever forces have been thought of in the Lord, all those have been conceived by contemplators on Him. What difference, otherwise, may there be between the functions of fire such as burning and cooking ? He, too, is nothing except for His luminosity. As such, there is no difference between Him and His luminosity, which is his force.
svaśaktyudrekajanakaṃ tādātmyādvastuno hi yat | śaktistadapi devyevaṃ bhāntyapyanyasvarūpiṇī |	It is the preponderance of the force of the entity concerned i.e., Siva which is the Goddess appearing as different from the entity.
śivaścāluptavibhavastathā sṛṣṭo'vabhāsate| svasaṃvinmātṛmakure svātantryādbhāvanādiṣu | |	Siva with His manifest glory appears in the form of the creation in the mirror of the cogniser of the self as also in the self-experience, etc. owing to His autonomy.
tasmādyena mukhenaiṣa bhātyanaṃśo'pi tattathā | śaktirityeṣa vastveva śaktitadvatkramaḥ sphuṭaḥ |	Therefore, the medium through which He appears in His particular aspects such as bhuvan, vigraha, jyoti, kha, sabda and mantra in spite of being integral in Himself, bears out explicitly the reality of His Force as apart from Himself.
śrīmatkiraṇaśāstre ca tatpraśnottarapūrvakam | anubhāvo vikalpo'pi mānaso na manaḥ śive |	In the Kirana Sāstra also has been stated the same relationship between Siva and Sakti in the form of question and answer as the Reality and its mode of manifestation respectively besides the fact that both contemplation and option are mental while Siva lies beyond the mind.
avijñāya śivaṃ dīkṣā kathamityatra cottaram| kṣudhādyanubhavo naiva vikalpo nahi mānasaḥ |	In answer to the same query it has been stated there that initiation has no possibility at all without the understanding of Śiva in the same way as hunger and thirst being real experiences have no option in sheer ideation of their elimination.
rasādyanadhyakṣatve'pi rūpādeva yathā tarum | vikalpo vetti tadvattu nādabindvādinā śivam |	of the perception of its form, even so one has the possibility of knowing Śiva on the basis of sound and point bindu as indicatory of Him.
bahuśaktitvamasyoktaṃ śivasya yadato mahān | kalātattvapuravarṇāṇupadādirbhedavistāraḥ |	Siva is great as He is possessed of a multiplicity of forces. His forces are kalā, tattva, bhuvana, varna, pada, etc.
sṛṣṭisthititirodhānasaṃhārānugrahādi ca| turyamityapi devasya bahuśaktitvajṛmbhitam | jāgratsvapnasuṣuptānyatadatītāni yānyapi| tānyapyamuṣya nāthasya svātantryalaharībharaḥ | |	in their entire expanse Manifestations of the multiplicity of forces of the Lord are inclusive of creation, sustenance, withdrawal, destruction and favour, etc., and if withdrawal were included within sustenance and favour within destruction the fourth would be His force of illumination. Burdens of His force of autonomy are also the states of wakefulness, dream, sound sleep and whatever lies in transcendence of the state of sound sleep.
mahāmantreśamantreśamantrāḥ śivapurogamā | akalau sakalaśceti śivasyaiva vibhūtayaḥ |	The glories of His manifestations are also Lordship of the great mantra as well as mantras in general, which all presuppose Him, besides His presence within all as the factor of unification within all divisions.
tattvagrāmasya sarvasya dharmaḥ syādanapāyavān | ātmaiva hi svabhāvātmetyuktaṃ śrītriśiromate |	The basic nature of all essences ought to be indestructible. The Self is the basic nature of all essential entities; this has been maintained by Trisiras.
hṛdisthaṃ sarvahasthaṃ svabhāvasthaṃ susūkṣmakam| sāmūhyaṃ caiva tattvānāṃ grāmaśabdena kīrtitam | |	He is embodied within all, centring particularly in the heart and thus lying in the subtle form in the inner nature of beings. His presence within all has also been indicated by the collectivity of all essences.
ātmaiva dharma ityuktaḥ śivāmṛtapariplutaḥ | prakāśāvasthitaṃ jñānaṃ bhāvābhāvādimadhyataḥ |	Self alone is the fundamental nature of the individual which remains flooded within by the ambrosia of Śiva besides His illumination which is being manifest from within being and non-being both. NOTES: Non-being stands here for deviation from the admittance of Śiva as the absolute and all-pervading Reality including one's own being.
svasthāne vartanaṃ jñeyaṃ draṣṭṛtvaṃ vigatāvṛti | viviktavastukathitaśuddhavijñānanirmalaḥ | | grāmadharmavṛttiruktastasya sarvaṃ prasiddhyati | ūrdhvaṃ tyakvādho viśetsa rāmastho madhyadeśagaḥ |	The aspirant needs to remain purely within his inner being and see the reality of it penetratively without wandering around having purified himself of all the dross which keep him clouded all the time otherwise by suspense about the truth. He needs to get established in his inmost nature having withdrawn himself upward from breathing-in prāṇa as also from apāna, i.e., releasing the breath from below and thus by understanding how to remain constantly in the middle which is the state of complete peace.
gatiḥ sthānaṃ svapnajāgradunmeṣaṇanimeṣaṇe| dhāvanaṃ plavanaṃ caiva āyāsaḥ śaktivedanam | buddhibhedāstathā bhāvāḥ saṃjñāḥ karmāṇyanekaśaḥ| eṣa rāmo vyāpako'tra śivaḥ paramakāraṇam | |	Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent... Movement gati, placement sthāna, dream svapna, waking jāgrat , opening of the eye unmesa, closing of the eye nimesa , running dhāvana , floating plavana, effort āyāsa, cognisance of force śakti, experience vedana, existence bhāva, denomination sanjñā and action karmāni, all these fourteen factors are forms of pervasion of Śiva as there ultimate cause.
kalmaṣakṣīṇamanasā smṛtimātranirodhanāt | dhyāyate paramaṃ dhyeyaṃ gamāgamapade sthitam |	- Siva as the Supreme Being is accessed through meditation by means of the mind whose blemishes have been attenuated, memories have been stopped from occurrence and stays positioned in the midst of breathing-in and breathing-out.
paraṃ śivaṃ ta vrajati bhairavākhyaṃ japādapi | tu tatsvarūpaṃ japaḥ prokto bhāvābhāvapadacyutaḥ |	The aspirant reaches Śiva, known also as Bhairava, by keeping on repeating His name continuously as the repetition of His name culminates in the realisation of His essential being manifesting itself both in the form of being as well as what is apart from being including movement.
tadatrāpi tadīyena svātantryeṇopakalpitaḥ| dūrāsannādiko bhedacitsvātantryavyapekṣayā |	In this context of repetition of His name and meditation also, He has been conceived in regard to His autonomy with respect to His lying close by or alternatively at a distance.
evaṃ svātantryapūrṇatvādatidurghaṭakāryayam | kena nāma na rūpeṇa bhāsate parameśvaraḥ |	Indeed, what may be the act through which the Supreme Lord may not be manifest! He manifests Himself in all His bareness as well as in disguises of His real form.
nirāvaraṇamābhāti bhātyāvṛtanijātmakaḥ | āvṛtānāvṛto bhāti bahudhā bhedasaṃgamāt |	He appears also as partially bare and partially covered on account of association of intervening factors of various kinds.
iti śaktitrayaṃ nāthe svātantryāparanāmakam| icchādibhirabhikhyābhirgurūbhiḥ prakaṭīkṛtam |	All these three modes of His manifestation in the Lord are synonyms of His power of autonomy. This has been called by teachers by such words as desire, etc.
devo hyanvarthaśāstroktaiḥ śabdaiḥ samupadiśyate | mahābhairavadevo'yaṃ patiryaḥ paramaḥ śivaḥ |	The Divine has been referred to in the scriptures by significant words. He has been indicated by the word Mahā Bhairava who is the Lord Supreme Siva Himself.
viśvaṃ bibharti pūraṇadhāraṇayogena tena ca śriyate| savimarśatayā svarūpataśca saṃsārabhīruhitakṛcca |	He is called Bhairava because He bears the world by virtue of sustaining and providing it with means of sustenance. This is why He is taken resort to. Contemplatively as well as essentially He is the well-doer of those who are afraid of the world.
saṃsārabhītijanitādravātparāmarśato'pi hṛdi jātaḥ | prakaṭībhūtaṃ bhavabhayavimarśanaṃ śaktipātato yena |	Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent... It is also on account of the cry born of fear from the world and contemplation on the same that He manifests Himself in the heart. Contemplation on Him is also evoked by the transmission of the force of aspiration for Him in the aspirant by the teacher.
nakṣatraprerakakālatattvasaṃśoṣakāriṇo ye ca | kālagrāsasamādhānarasikamanaḥsu teṣu ca prakaṭaḥ | saṃkocipaśujanabhiye yāsāṃ ravaṇaṃ svakaraṇadevīnām | antarbahiścaturvidhakhecaryādikagaṇasyāpi | tasya svāmī saṃsāravṛttivighaṭanamahābhīmaḥ | bhairava iti gurubhirimairanvarthe saṃstutaḥ śāstre | heyopādeyakathāvirahe svānandaghanatayocchalanam| krīḍā sarvotkarṣeṇa vartanecchā tathā svatantratvam |	Bhairava reveals Himself to yogins in their hearts who are capable of drying up the stream of time which is the mover of the planetary system. This they do by virtue of stopping the functions of breathing-in and breathing-out, prāna and apāna, and redirecting the breath via the susumnā and thus by getting the bliss of equipoise of mind. In scriptures grand teachers have explained the derivation of the word bhairava significantly as the Divine Being who as the frightful mighty agent is responsible for removing the evil of worldliness which is the cause of bringing contraction to the Self so as to remove it away from Siva to place it down to the level of animality by means of bringing limitation to the range of the senses operating externally and four forces, namely, khecari, gocari, dikacari and bhucari operating internally.
vyavaharaṇamabhinne'pi svātmani bhedena saṃjalpaḥ | nikhilāvabhāsanācca dyotanamasya stutiryataḥ sakalam |	- On account of complete absence of any scope for both acceptance and rejection of anything in the world which as a whole is the result of the delightful play of His autonomy manifest in its completeness, He reveals His duality practically from within the oneness of Himself. It is owing to His illumination that all stands revealed to us.
tatpravaṇamātmalābhātprabhṛti samaste'pi kartavye | bodhātmakaḥ samastakriyāmayo dṛkkriyāguṇaśca gatiḥ | |	This is why we need to pray to Him. Beginning from realisation of the Self all our understandings and actions are pervaded by Him including the parts of space, movements, qualities and functions.
iti nirvacanaiḥ śivatanu śāstre gurubhiḥ smṛto devaḥ | śāsanarodhanapālanapācanayogātsa sarvamupakurute | tena patiḥ śreyomaya eva śivo nāśivaṃ kimapi tava |	Brahma- Sutra II.. By virtue of providing for the scriptures as regulators of the course of life, stopping from doing evil acts , sustaining the creatures and cooking the action so as to yield the result to their doers as Pati, Rudra, etc., as Siva you have provided for the well-being of all, O Lord, without any exception as you have been remembered by teachers in the Sivatanu Sāstra.
īdṛgrūpaṃ kiyadapi rudropendrādiṣu sphuradyena | tenāvacchedanude paramamahatpadaviśeṣaṇamupāttam |	The adjectives parama and mahat have been adduced with His name in the exposition in order to do away with the probability of any sense of limitation likely to creep in with His name as is the case with Rudra, Upendra, etc.
iti yajjñeyasatattva darśyate tacchivājñayā | mayā svasaṃvitsattarkapatiśāstratrikakramāt |	In this way, the real subject matter is going to be expounded by me with the permission of Siva embodying my own experience, arguments, the Saiva scriptures known as Trika śāstra on account of being based on the admittance of the reality of three fundamental entities, i.e. Siva, Sakti and Jiva.
tasya śaktaya evaitāstistro bhānti parādikāḥ| sṛṣṭau sthitau laye turye tenaitā dvādaśoditāḥ | tāvānpūrṇasvabhāvo'sau paramaḥ śivaḥ ucyate | tenātropāsakāḥ sākṣāttatraiva pariniṣṭhitāḥ |	It is these three forces of Him, namely, parā, transcendent, etc., which become twelve by getting multiplied by the four states, such as creation, sustenance, dissolution and the fourth namely the transcendent. It is by being inclusive of all these twelve forces within Him that He is supposed to be full which is indicative of His auspiciousness, Siva-hood capable of serving as the final destination of His worshippers.
tāsāmapi ca bhedāṃśanyūnādhikyādiyojanam | tatsvātantrsabalādeva śāstreṣu paribhāṣitam |	With regard to the number of these forces also there is the probability of becoming less or more which, too, is demonstrative of the exercise of His autonomy. This has been defined in the scriptures.
ekavīro yāmalo'tha triśaktiścaturātmakaḥ| pañcamūrtiḥ ṣaḍātmāyaṃ saptako'ṣṭakabhūṣitaḥ |	He is supposed alternatively as only one Hero, a combination of the Being and Śrī Tantrāloka its force, possessed of three forces i.e., creation, sustenance and dissolution, fourfold, of five forms, six forms, seventh as well as eighth being adorned variously in these forms.
navātmā daśadikchaktirekādaśakalātmakaḥ| dvādaśāramahācakranāyako bhairavastviti |	He is conceived also as possessed of nine selves, as spread over ten directions, and as inclusive of His force as the eleventh besides as the great hero Bhairava on account of being the leader of the circle comprising twelve spokes.
evaṃ yāvatsahasrāre nisaṃkhyāre'pi vā prabhuḥ | viśvacakre maheśāno viśvaśaktirvijṛmbhate |	- In this way, the great Lord, as the universal force, manifests Himself in the circle of the universe until one thousand spokes and even up to the infinitude.
teṣāmapi ca cakrāṇāṃ svavargānugamātmanā | aikyena cakrago bhedastatra tatra nirūpitaḥ |	Variety of the circles has also been elucidated uniformly in view of their groups at places.
catuṣṣaḍvirdvigaṇanāyogātraiśirase mate | ṣaṭcakreśvaratā nāthasyoktā citranijākṛteḥ |	In the Trisiras view, varieties of circles have been elucidated in view of four and six spokes each redoubled twice i.e., , , , and , , and thus in six varieties collectively demonstrating multiplicity of forms of the Lord, and His rulership.
nāmāni cakradevīnāṃ tatra kṛtyavibhedataḥ | saumyaraudrākṛtidhyānayogīnyanvarthakalpanāt |	Also have been elucidated therein names of goddesses of circles with respect to difference in their functions particularly in regard to those mild and ferocious yielding results to devotees in keeping with their mould of devotion.
ekasya saṃvinnāthasya hyāntarī pratibhā tanuḥ | saumyaṃ vānyanmitaṃ saṃvidurmicakramupāsyate |	The internal genius of the sole Lord manifests itself in the mild or ferocious form being worshipped accordingly in the form of wave of circle of awareness.
asya syātpuṣṭirityeṣā saṃviddevī tathoditāt | dhyānātsaṃjalpasaṃmiśrād vyapārāccāpi bāhyataḥ |	This fact finds confirmation in the manifestation of the goddess of consciousness concerned in the meditation and articulation of the aspirants as also through their behaviour even externally.
sphuṭībhūtā satī bhāti tasya tādṛkphalapradā| puṣṭi śuṣkasya sarasībhāvo jalamataḥ sitam | | anugamya tato dhyānaṃ tatpradhānaṃ pratanyate | ye ca svabhāvato varṇā rasani ṣyandino yathā | |	Evident becomes the result of meditation in the same way as becomes obvious from the whiteness or transparency of the water filling up the vacant pond. Whiteness or transparency of the water is indicative of the experience of blessedness born of stillness and composure of mind resulting from the meditation. Having understood the importance of meditation in this respect, the aspirant should lay emphasis on it accordingly.
dantyauṣṭhyadantyaprāyāste kaicidvaṇaiḥ kṛtā saha | taṃ bījabhāvamāgatya saṃvidaṃ sphuṭayanti tām |	Such letters need to be used in japa, etc., which shed naturally sweetness. For instance, such letters mainly are dental and labial which in combination with certain other letters get transformed into seed mantras and make the consciousness concerned manifest.
puṣṭiṃ kuru rasenainamāpyāyayatarāmiti| saṃjalpo'pi vikalpātmā kiṃ tāmeva na pūrayet | |	- The aspirant needs to substantiate his meditation by means of experience of delight. Conversation about matters spiritual is also supportive of meditation. As such, why should meditation not be supported by it as an alternative to it.
amṛtedamidaṃ kṣīramidaṃ sarpirbalāvaham | tenāsya bījaṃ puṣṇīyāmityenāṃ pūrayetkriyām |	While making the offering particularly of milk and clarified butter the idea which needs to be cultivated is this milk is the juice of immortality, this butter is giver of strength.
tasmādviśveśvaro bodhabhairavaḥ samupāsyate | avacchedānavacchidbhyāṃ bhogamokṣārthibhirjanaiḥ |	This is how the awareness of Bhairava is worshipped indirectly and directly both by aspirants of facilitation of worldly life as well as those of liberation accordingly.
ye'pyandevatābhaktā ityato gururādiśat | ye bodhādvyatiriktaṃ hi kiṃcidyājyatayā biduḥ | te'pi vedyaṃ viviñcānā bodhābhedena manvate | tenāvicchinnatāmarśarūpāhantāprathātmanaḥ |	Those who are devoted to gods other than Siva, according to Abhinavagupta and Krsna, according to Bhagavadgītā, this has been instructed by the teacher, and thus consider someone other than pure self-awareness as the object of offering of oblation, they, too, eventually, in their last analysis admit the self- awareness itself as that object.
svayaṃprathasya na vidhiḥ sṛṣṭyātmāsya ca pūrvagaḥ| vedyā hi devatāsṛṣṭiḥ śakterhetoḥ samṛtthitā |	What obtains by itself has no injunction prior to itself to follow. Its predecessor is only the Creator of the world. In this respect, the creation of gods needs to be understood to have been done for the sake of assisting the Supreme Force, Sakti.
ahaṃrūpā tu saṃvittirnityā svaprathanātmikā | vidhirniyogastryaṃśā ca bhāvanā codanātmikā |	Consciousness is ego-centric and eternally self-expansive while the Veda is injunctive, ordainer and evocative of feelings, emotions and sentiments.
tadekasiddhā indrādyā vidhipūrvā hi devatāḥ | ahaṃbodhastu na tathā te tu savedyarūpatām |	- Gods like Indra, etc., have their validity only in Vedic injunctions. They are not associated with the self-experience of the aspirants. They are merely objects of awareness.
unmagnāmeva paśyantastaṃ vidanto'pi no biduḥ| taduktaṃ na vidurmāṃ tu tattvenātaścalanti te |	Those who are devoted to them may look at one who is Self-absorbed unmangas but cannot understand the Reality in which the Self-absorbed might have dissolved his mind.
calanaṃ tu vyavacchinnarūpatāpattireva yā | devāndevayajo yāntītyādi tena nyarūpyat | |	This has been elucidated in the Bhagavadgitā by the remark that those who are devoted to gods go to them, etc.
nimajjya vedyatāṃ ye tu tatra saṃvinmayīṃ sthitim | viduste hyanavacchinnaṃ tadbhaktā api yānti mām |	Those who having sunk their knowership come to understand themselves as pure consciousness, such devotees of mine claims Śri Krsna come directly to Me.
sarvatrātra hyahaṃśabdo bodhamātraikavācakaḥ | sa bhoktṛprabhuśabdābhyāṃ yājyayaṣṭṛtayoditaḥ |	It is He who has been referred to by the words ‘enjoyer', bhoktr, and Lord, prabhu, in the sense of the object of the sacrifice as well as the agent of it by the words bearing those meanings respectively.
yājamānī saṃvideva yājyā nānyeti coditam na tvākṛtiḥ kuto'pyanyā devatā na hi socitā |	It is the consciousness itself which is the sacrificer as well as the object whom the sacrifice is offered and none else. By no means is there any figure of any deity other than it which anyway needs to be brought in here.
vidhiśca noktaḥ ko'pyatra mantrādi vṛttidhāma vā | so'yamātmānamāvṛtya sthito jaḍapadaṃ gataḥ |	Here there is no implication of any injunction as passed by the Brāhmanas nor is there any scope for advisement of the Vedic mantra as the latter involves action for which there is no place here in Self-consciousness which having returned to itself assumes the state of inconscience.
āvṛtānāvṛtātmā tu devādisthāvarāntagaḥ | jaḍājaḍasyāpyetasya dvairūpyasyāsti citratā |	Being ranging from gods up to immobile objects are the results of this self- involvement and revelation of consciousness. The variegatedness of the conscient and inconscient is also the consequence of the same twofold act of withdrawal and revelation.
tasya svatantrabhāvo hi kiṃ kiṃ yanna vicintayet | taduktaṃ triśiraḥ śāstre saṃbuddha iti vetti yaḥ | jñeyabhāvo hiṃ ciddharmastacchāyācchādayenna tām |	By virtue of His autonomy what may be the form in which He may not think to appear! In regard to this, it has been stated in the Trisiras Sāstra that he who knows all this, is completely informed, sambuddha. Knowing is the essential nature of consciousness. As such, its shadow as ignorance , therefore, cannot engulf it.
tenājaḍasya bhāgasya pudgalāṇvādisaṃjñinaḥ | anāvaraṇabhāgāṃśe vaicitryaṃ bahudhā sthitam |	This is why there is variety of various sorts of existing in that part of the inconscient which is known as pudgala, anu, paśu, etc.
saṃvidrūpe na bhedo'sti vāstavo yadyapi dhruve | tathāpyāvṛtinirhāsatāratamyātsa lakṣyate |	Though there is no difference at all in consciousness withal its invincibility, still it appears casually on account of its action of involution and revelation.
tadvistareṇa vakṣyāmaḥ śaktipātavinirṇaye| samāpya paratāṃ sthaulyaprasaṃge carcayiṣyate |	I shall discuss all this elaborately in the context of decision on transmission of force, saktipāta having finished discussion on otherness of Him from Himself, in the context of gross topics.
ataḥ kaṃcitpramātāraṃ prati prathayate vibhuḥ | pūrṇameva nijaṃ rūpaṃ kaṃcidaṃśāṃśikākramāt |	This is why the Lord reveals His full form to a certain aspirant and to a certain other one only His form of part and whole.
viśvabhāvaikabhāvātmasvarūpaprathanaṃ hi yat | aṇūnāṃ tatparaṃ jñānaṃ tadanyadaparaṃ bahu | tacca sākṣādupāyena tadupāyādināpi ca | prathamānaṃ vicitrābhirbhaṃgībhiriha bhidyate | |	The atomic Self with the experience of oneness with the Universal Being is the highest form of knowledge in transcendence of all the rest of the lower kind. That highest kind of knowledge reveals itself directly through means meant for its revelation as well as indirectly through means facilitating that knowledge. Thus, there are various ways of revelation of that knowledge.
tatrāpi svaparadvāradvāritvātsarvaśoṃ'śaśa | vyavadhānāvyavadhinā bhūyānbhedaḥ pravartate | |	ānava There are also kinds of knowledge which differ in view of having been attained by oneself and with the help of someone else, that, too, attained for oneself or Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent... for the other, completely or in parts, directly or indirectly thus multiplying into a large number of kinds.
jñānasya cābhyupāyo yo na tadajñānamucyate | jñānameva tu tatsūkṣmaṃ paraṃ tvicchātmakaṃ matam |	The kind of knowledge useful in attaining the highest kind of knowledge is by no means ignorance. It, too, indeed, is knowledge with this difference that compared to it the highest kind of knowledge is extremely subtle and is dependent on the willpower of the aspirant.
upāyopeyabhāvastu jñānasya sthaulyavibhramaḥ | eṣaiva ca kriyāśaktirbandhamokṣaikakāraṇam |	Distinction in the mode of knowledge into what is aimed at and what serves as a means in its acquisition is the illusion of grossness which as the power of force acts as the sole cause of bondage and liberation.
tatrādye svaparāmarśe nirvikalpaikadhāmani | yatsphuretprakaṭaṃ sākṣāttadicchākhyaṃ prakīrttitam | | yathā visphuritadṛśāmanusandhi vināpyalam | bhāti bhāvaḥ sphuṭastadvatkeṣāmapi śivātmatā |	From amongst the two, what emanates out of contemplation directly on one's own being is known as arising out of one's willpower. Where the fortunate knower becomes confirmed directly without requirement of any contemplation that he is none else but Siva Himself like the visitor of anything with his eyes wide open regarding its identity, such knowledge is what is born of the Sāmbhava method.
bhūyo bhūyo vikalpāṃśaniścayakramacarcanāt| yatparāmarśamabhyeti jñānopāyaṃ tu tadvaduḥ | |	As distinct from it is the Jñānopāya or knowledge acquired through the aid of the knowledge where the aspirant arrives at the same conclusion following contemplation on various intervening factors.
yattu tatkalpanāklṛptabahirbhūtārthasādhanam| kriyopāyaṃ tadāmnātaṃ bhedo nātrāpavargagaḥ |	- On the other hand, the knowledge that arises out of external means depending on imagination, etc., is known as Kriyopāya, dependent on action. It does not serve directly as a way to the supreme end.
yato nānyā kriyā nāma jñānameva hi tattathā | rūḍheryogāntatāṃ prāptamiti śrīgamaśāsane | |	As regards relationship between knowledge and action, the latter is knowledge itself turned static as stated in the Śrigama śāstra.
yogo nānyaḥ kriyā nānyā tattvārūḍhā hi yā matiḥ | svacittavāsanāśāntau sā kriyetyabhidhīyate | |	Yoga is different and action is different, this is not true. On reaching the reality and getting rid of the vices of the inner being, yoga becomes known as kriyā, action.
svacitte vāsanāḥ karmamalamāyāprasūtayaḥ| tāsāṃ śāntinimittaṃ yā matiḥ saṃvitsvabhāvikā |	Vices lingering in the inner being have their origin in impressions of action born of māyā, illusion. Idea which can lead to their pacification is of the nature of consciousness.
sā dehārambhibāhyasthatattvavrātādhiśāyinī| kriyā saiva ca yogaḥ syāttattvānāṃ cillayīkṛtau |	The vice settled in the inner being is the cause of the formation of the body and hence rules over the entire group of factors responsible for externalisation of the being. This action of externalisation is known as kriyā as well as yoga if it results in the dissolution of the factors of concretisation.
loke'pi kila gacchāmītyevamantaḥ sphuraiva yā| sā dehaṃ deśamakṣāṃścāpyāviśantī gatikriyā |	In the practical life also, the will ‘I go ' has its root in the inner being which with the help of the body, association with the space required to be covered and the senses and organs of action gets materialised in the form of action of movement.
tasmātkriyāpi yā nāma jñānameva hi sā tataḥ | jñānameva vimokṣāya yuktaṃ caitadudāhṛtam |	Therefore, what is known as action is, indeed, knowledge itself. Thus, eventually it is knowledge itself which leads to liberation. This gets elucidated hereby.
mokṣo hi nāma naivānyaḥ svarūpaprathanaṃ hi saḥ | svarūpaṃ cātmanaḥ saṃvinnānyattatra tu yāḥ punaḥ |	As regards the state of liberation, it, too, is nothing but fulfilment of the Self while Self is nothing but one's own awareness in its essence.
kriyādikāḥ śaktayastā saṃvidrūpādhikā nahi| asaṃvidrūpatāyogāddharmiṇaścānirūpaṇāt |	Forces of action, too, are nothing but form of consciousness. If they were not to be accepted as such, consciousness would not be possible to be elucidated. Unlike in the philosophy of Kaṇāda, there is, no distinction between the quality and the object qualified in Saivism.
parameśvaraśāstre hi na ca kāṇādadṛṣṭivat | śaktonāṃ dharmarūpāṇāmāśrayaḥ ko'pi kathyate | | tataśca dṛkkriyecchādyā bhinnāścecchaktayastathā| ekaḥ śiva itīyaṃ vāgvastuśūnyaiva jāyate |	Varieties of objects in the world have arisen owing to the imagination of the people involved as their knowers. Otherwise, what is the difference between burning and cooking by the fire? On the admittance of this kind of difference, the act of seeing and the awareness of willing would have to be admitted as forces different from each other and thus the proposition that Śiva is only one and non-dual would become meaningless.
tasmātsaṃvittvamevaitatsvātantryaṃ yattadapyalam| vivicyamānaṃ bahvīṣu paryavasyati śaktiṣu |	Thus, it is sufficient to contend that consciousness itself is the autonomy which assumes the form of various forces.
yataścātmaprathā mokṣastannehāśakyamīdṛśam nāvaśyaṃ kāraṇātkāryaṃ tajjñānyapi na mucyate | yato jñānena mokṣasya yā hetuphalatoditā | na sā mukhyā tato nāyaṃ prasaṃga iti niścitam |	It is undoubted that expansion of the Self is liberation. Otherwise, it is not necessary that the cause has necessarily to produce result and, as such, even the enlightened person would have the privilege of liberation. To admit that liberation is possible through knowledge, suggests cause and effect relationship between knowledge and liberation, no doubt but such a relationship is not the main object of contention here .
evaṃ jñānasvabhāvaiva kriyā sthūlatvamātmani | yato vahati tenāsyāṃ citratā dṛśyatāṃ kila | | |	Thus, knowledge is the essential nature of action as by virtue of it knowledge becomes tangible and consequently comes to assume variety of perceptibility. Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...
kriyopāye'bhyupāyānāṃ grāhyabāhyavibhedinām | bhedopabhedavaividhyānnisaṃkhyamavāntarāt |	Actions, means of their accomplishment and aids in that accomplishment when multiplied by the perceptibility and externality, etc., of objects, assume innumerability of factors responsible for both knowledge and action.
anena caitatpradhvastaṃ yatkecana śaśaṅkire | upāyabhedānmokṣe'pi bhedaḥ syāditi sūrayaḥ |	This does amount to suggest that there is difference between the cause and the effect and therefore there must be some difference between the state of liberation and the knowledge leading to it.
malatacchaktividhvaṃsatirobhūcyutimadhyataḥ | hetubhede'pi no bhinnā ghaṭadhvaṃsādivṛttivat |	From within the differences among impurity, powers of its destruction, covering and making fall down, though there is difference, yet really there is no difference at all like the instance of breaking of a pitcher.
tadetattrividhatvaṃ hi śāstre śrīpūrvanāmani | ādeśi parameśitrā samāveśavinirṇaye |	Similarly, knowledge of Śiva might have been acquired in three ways, as mentioned a littler earlier, by means of ānava śākta or Sāmbhava method but the end-result of getting liberated is only of a single kind. This is what Sri Pūrva Sāstra maintains.
akiṃciccintakasyaiva guruṇā pratibodhataḥ | utpadyate ya āveśaḥ śāmbhavo'sāvudīritaḥ | uccārarahitaṃ vastu cetasaiva vicintayan | yaṃ samāveśamāpnoti śāktaḥ so'trābhidhīyate |	Sāmbhava method of liberation is that in which the aspirant makes himself rid of all ideation and being awakened in his consciousness by the teacher, gets aroused within an exclusive aspiration for Siva. The exclusive aspiration for Siva which is attained through contemplation on Him without any pronunciation whatsoever, well within one's consciousness is known as Śākta.
uccārakaraṇadhyānavarṇaṃsthānaprakalpanaiḥ| yo bhavetsa samāveśaḥ samyagāṇava ucyate | |	The same when attained via the course of pronunciation, use of the vocal organ, meditation, and due discretion of the place of pronunciation, etc., is called Anava.
akiṃciccintakasyeti vikalpānupayogitā | tayā ca jhaṭiti jñeyasamāpattirnirūpyate| sā kathaṃ bhavatītyāha guruṇātigarīyasā | jñeyābhimukhabodhena drākprarūḍhatvaśālinā|	- When the aspirant makes himself completely rid of ideation, alternation of proposition and disposition being made useless for him, it is in this state of exclusive aspiration that Siva manifests Himself immediately to him. How does this occur, this has been explained by the teacher out of his extreme grace as under: This occurs owing to direct face-to-face arousal of the awareness which remains always ready for it. Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...
tṛtīyārthe tasi vyākhyā vā vaiyadhikaraṇyataḥ | āveśaścāsvatantrasya svatadrūpanimajjanāt | paratadrūpatā śambhorādyācchaktyavibhāginaḥ| tenāyamatra vākyārtho vijñeyaṃ pronmiṣatsvayam | vināpi niścayena drāk mātṛdarpaṇabimbitam | mātāramadharīkurvat svāṃ vibhūtiṃ pradarśayat | |	, in the terms pratibodhatah, the suffix tas has been used in the sense of the instrumental case suggesting that exclusive aspiration for Siva arises owing to the instrumentality of the initiation imparted by the teacher under the condition that the aspirant becomes fully absorbed in the contemplation on Him unreservedly. Thus the Self, getting free from the otherness from Siva experiences itself as He Himself in the state of the gravity of devotion to Him who is non-different from the primeval force. - The sense is that the intellect of the individual serves as a mirror reflecting immediately Siva in the abundance of His glory over and above the personal limitations of the individual concerned.
āste hṛdayanairmalyātiśaye tāratamyataḥ | jñeyaṃ dvidhā ca cinmātraṃ jaḍaṃ cādyaṃ ca kalpitam |	As regards the object of knowledge, it is of two kinds: first pure consciousness and second, the inconscient.
itarattu tathā satyaṃ tadvibhāgo'yamīdṛśaḥ | jaḍena yaḥ samāveśaḥ sapraticchandakākṛtiḥ|	- The exclusive absorption caused by the inconscient is reflective in its nature while that caused by consciousness is of the nature of oneness with the Reality and decidedly nothing else.
caitanyena samāveśastādātmyaṃ nāparaṃ kila | tenāvikalpā saṃvittirbhāvanādyanapekṣiṇī |	It culminates in the experience of the aspirant's identity with Him which experience itself serves as the means of what follows it, not requiring anything else to serve as the means for it.
santu tādātmyamāpannā tu teṣāmupāyatā | vikalpāpekṣayā mānamavikalpamiti bruvan | | pratyukta eva siddhaṃ hi vikalpenānugamyate | gṛhītamiti suspaṣṭā niścayasya yataḥ prathā | |	While stating that what comes optionally is much more valid as compared to what comes along with options, the opponent gets refuted. It is only what is availed of optionlessly and self-proved which is inferred with options. Options only confirm its validity. ‘I receive the gift offered to me, this kind of sense arises only when the act of giving is shorn of options.
gṛhṇāmītyavikalpaikyabalāttu pratipadyate | avikalpātmasaṃvittau yā sphurattaiva vastunaḥ |	Indeed, siddhi or the sense of final attainment arises out of the awareness of optionlessness in the attainment which is impossible otherwise. This is true only of consciousness.
yadvikalpānapekṣatvasāpekṣatve nijātmani | niśīthe'pi maṇijñānī vidyutkālapradarśitān | | tāṃstānviśeṣāṃścinute ratnānāṃ bhūyasāmapi | nairmalyaṃ saṃvidaścedaṃ pūrvābhyāsavaśādo |	Apart from the case of purity of consciousness, elsewhere it is illusory. - As regards the distinction between option and optionlessness within oneself, the jeweller even in the dense darkness of the midnight and only in available momentary flash of lightning from amidst a lot of gems can select pieces which are less precious, which are more precious and which are most precious. All this Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...
aniyantreśvarecchāta ityetaccarcayiṣyate | pañcāśadvidhatā cāsya samāveśasya varṇitā |	- That this is also possible due to the unrestricted will of God, will be discussed subsequently. However, fifty varieties of this description are mentioned here itself.
ambhodhikāṣṭhājvalanasaṃkhyairbhedairyataḥ kramāt | puṃvidyāśaktisaṃjñaṃ yattatsarvavyāpakaṃ yataḥ |	There are thirty-six varieties related to the member of elements along with their other kinds such as those of the person, vidyā, force, four oceans, limit, and fire.
avyāpakebhyastenedaṃ bhedena gaṇitaṃ kila | aśuddhiśuddhyamānatvaśuddhitastu mitho'pi tat |	Out of these the person purusa, vidyā and śakti are all-pervading - They pervade up to māyā, Sadāśiva, and Śiva respectively in accordance with their respective position as the impure, getting purified and the pure.
bhūtānyadhyakṣasiddhāni kāryahetvanumeyataḥ | tattvavargātpṛthagbhūtasamākhyānyata eva hi | |	The elements are practically obvious by virtue of the law of causation, i.e., they being caused by the subtle forms known as tanmātras as distinct from them. The elements are obvious to our senses and hence they naturally create the impression of their reality.
sarvapratītisadbhāvagocaraṃ bhūtameva hi | viduścatuṣṭaye cātra sāvakāśe tadāsthitim | |	This is true of at least four of them. As regards the case of space, its positivity is proved by virtue of providing accommodation to the other four.
rudraśaktisamāveśaḥ paṃcadhā nanu carcyate | ko'vakāśo bhavettatra bhautāveśādivarṇane | prasaṃgādetaditi cetsamādhiḥ saṃbhavannayam | nāsmākaṃ mānasāvarjī loko bhinnaruciryataḥ | |	Now in the context of account of absorption into the five forces of Rudra, what may be the relevance of the account of the physical elements ? Now, if it is suggested that this has been done only incidentally, the point is that this has been done in the Tantra verily not in keeping with our wish but in keeping with the wish of their author himself as wishes of the people vary in keeping with their personal predilections.
ucyate dvaitaśāstreṣu parameśādvibheditā| bhūtādīnāṃ yathā sātra na tathā dvayavarjite |	In the texts professing dualism, what is contended is the world's otherness from the Lord. This is not so here where dualism has been avoided.
yāvānṣaṭtriṃśakaḥ so'yaṃ yadanyadapi kiṃcana| etāvatī mahādevī rudraśaktiranargalā |	All the thirty-six constituents of world and whatever else may be involved in its constitution, all these are only the Goddess, the force of Rudra which is irresistible.
tata eva dvitīye'sminnadhikāre nyarūpyata | dharāderviśvarūpatvaṃ pāñcadaśyādibhedataḥ |	The same point has been made out in the second Chapter of the work where it Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent... has been shown how earth, etc., are universal consisting of fifteen constituents.
tasmādyathā purasthe'rthe guṇādyaṃśāṃśikāmukhāt | niraṃśabhāvasaṃbodhastathaivāśāpi budhyatām | ata evāvikalpatvadhrauvyaprābhavavaibhavaiḥ | anyairvā śaktirūpatvāddhamaiḥ svasamavāyibhiḥ | sarvaśo'pyatha vāṃśena taṃ vibhuṃ parameśvaram | upāsate vikalpaughasaṃskārādye śrutotthitāt | te tattavatsvavikalpāntaḥ sphuraddharmapāṭavāt| dharmiṇaṃ pūrṇadharmoghamabhedenādhiśerate |	The purpose behind all these accounts is that just as happens in the case of an object lying before us and reviewed in all its particulars as parts and aspects of it so as to adjudge it as a whole, even so understanding of the totality of the reality as such has been aimed at via the account of its constituents. Thus, those who worship the Lord, who is all-pervading, unique, eternally constant, universally creative besides other qualifications of Him emerging out of His force which is inseparably associated with Him, no matter as a whole or partly by virtue of his past impressions or study of scriptures or even on account of whatever he might have heard from anyone, they become one with Him inseparably on account of having absorbed His qualities within themselves.
tvatsvarūpamavikalpamakṣajā kalpane na viṣayīkaroti cet | antarullikhitacitrasaṃvido no bhaveyuranubhūtayaḥ sphuṭāḥ |	If the senses were not to subject the real form of the Supreme Being in its basic essence, various kinds of awareness arising from within the aspirant would not have been made possible.
taduktaṃ śrīmataṅgādau svaśaktikiraṇātmakam | atha patyuradhiṣṭhānamityādyuktaṃ viśeṣaṇaiḥ |	This has been stated in the Śrī Matanga śāstra by means of adjectives that the seat of the Lord is effulgent with the rays of His own force.
tasyāṃ divi sudīptātmā niṣkampo'calamūrtimān| kāṣṭhā saiva parā sūkṣmā sarvadikkāmṛtātmikā | pradhvastāvaraṇā śāntā vastumātrātilālasā | ādyantopatā sādhvī mūrtitvenoparyate |	It is on that seat that lies He unwavering and effulgent like a statue representing the ultimate goal, the climax of subtlety, pervading all the directions with the sense of immortality, having done away with intervening obstructions, calm and quiet, manifesting the sheer reality, and straightaway beginningless and endless.
tathopacārasyātraitannimittaṃ saprayojanam | tanmukhā sphuṭatā dharmiṇyāśu tanmayatāsthitiḥ | ta eva dharmāḥ śaktyākhyāstaistairucitarūpakaiḥ|	It is with a view to these attributes of Him that adjectives are purposely used in prayers to Him with the objective of getting one with Him expressly and quickly. It is these features of Him which are known as His forces manifested by means of various metaphors and are worshipped variously in the process of getting one with Him.
tatra kācitpunaḥ śaktiranantā vā mitāśca vā | ākṣipeddhavatāsattvanyāyāddūrāntikatvataḥ | |	- As such, may be that a certain force of Him is infinite while a certain other one finite as also someone may be trifling and the other one substantial, someone far away while the other one close by.
tena pūrṇasvabhāvatvaṃ prakāśatvaṃ cidātmatā| viśvaśaktīrākṣipedvyāpakatvataḥ|	It is owing to His all-pervasiveness that have been made manifest His perfection, luminosity, all-consciousness, and formidability as He becomes capable of exercising all His forces.
bhairavatvaṃ sadāśivādayastūrdhvavyāptyabhāvādadhojuṣaḥ śaktīḥ samākṣipeyustadupāsāntikadūrataḥ |	Their worshippers may make use of them from close quarters or from a distance as per their choice. - Thus, gets introduced the śākta-upāya which is next to the śāmbhava and alternative to the latter .
itthaṃbhāve ca śāktākhyo vaikalpikapathakramaḥ | iha tūkto yatastasmāt pratiyogyavikalpakam |	As regards the relevance of introducing it in the midst of exposition of the Sāmbhava, that has been done with a view to clarify the contextual in comparison to the alternative one.
avikalpapathārūḍho yena yena pathā viśet | dharāsadāśivāntena tena tena śivībhavet | nirmale hṛdaye prāgryasphuradbhūmyaṃśabhāsini | prakāśe tanmukhenaiva saṃvitparaśivātmatā |	No matter whatever path the aspirant of the Supreme Being may take beginning from the earth up to Sadāśiva, he is sure to get oneness with Siva. If the heart of the aspirant is pure, he may take to even the earth, the very last one of His manifestations and try to see in it His illumination and is sure to realise even therein the Siva-hood.
evaṃ parecchāśaktyaṃśasadupāyamimaṃ viduḥ | śāmbhavākhyaṃ samāveśaṃ sumatyantenivāsinaḥ |	Sambhunātha, the disciple of Sumatinātha has thus acclaimed this kind of absorption, too, as Sāmbhava, in spite of it being dependent on the will of the Force.
śākto'tha bhaṇyate cetodhīmanohaṃkṛtiḥ sphuṭam | savikalpatayā māyāmayamicchādi vastutaḥ |	The next mode of approach to Śivais known as śākta which obviously is dependent on the application of citta which has three aspects, i.e., intellect, manas, and the I-sense.
abhimānena saṃkalpādhyavasāyakrameṇa yaḥ | śākta sa māyopāyo'pi tadante nirvikalpakaḥ | | paśorvai yāvikalpābhūrdaśā sā śāmbhavī param | apūrṇā mātṛdaurātmyāttadapāye vikasvarā | |	Because of being an alternative, this illusory one includes as it does make use of desire, etc. The śākta approach to Siva is also known as Māyopāya as it involves the functions of willing, knowing and doing in the contemplation that I am all this. It, too, however, has the prospect of getting matured into the optionlessness of the final stage of oneness with Siva . The optionless state of even the pasu individual's soul or Self becomes the highest śāmbhavi on the removal of blemishes completely.
evaṃ vaikalpikī bhūmiḥ śākte kartṛtvavedane | yasyāṃ sphuṭe paraṃ tvasyāṃ saṃkocaḥ pūrvanītitaḥ |	Knowability and creativity become more manifest in the optional state of the Sākta approach. However, they remain contracted due to the limitations of the pasu.
tathā saṃkocasaṃbhāravilāyanaparasya tu | sā yatheṣṭāntarābhāsakāriṇī śaktirujjvalā | nanu vaikalpikī kiṃ dhīrāṇave nāsti tatra sā| anyopāyātra tūccārarahitatvaṃ nyarūpayat|	However, when the aspirant becomes keen to remove the limitation from Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent... within him, there emerges in him the Force which is brilliant and sufficiently illuminating. In the āņava approach to Siva also the śākta way of option is available with the difference, however, that here it is shorn of repetition of key words.
uccāraśabdenātroktā bahvantena tadādayaḥ | śaktyupāye na santyete bhedābhedau hi śaktitā | |	The word uccāra, as used here, means several things besides pronunciation which are karana, organ, dhyāna, meditation, varna, letter, sthāna, place of pronunciation .
aṇurnāma sphuṭo bhedastadupāya ihāṇavaḥ | vikalpaniścayātmaiva paryante nirvikalpaka |	As distinct from it, the approach of the śāktas is unity-in- diversity bhedābheda To be atomic as is the case with the Self is obviously distinctive from the rest.
nanu dhīmānasāhaṃkṛtpumāṃso vyāpnuyuḥ śivam | nādhovartitayā tena kathitaṃ kathamīdṛśam |	Now, the question arises regarding the prevalence of manas, buddhi and ahankāra in Siva which, however, were warded off in a previous verse under the place starting upward from Sadāśiva. Now, they happen to have been given a place here. How to reconcile the contradiction? The reconciliation is as follows.
ucyate vastuto'smākaṃ śiva eva yathāvidhaḥ | svarūpagopanaṃ kṛtvā svaprakāśaḥ punastathā |	For us, indeed, it is Śiva Himself who assumes all the forms of individuals as well as of the entire world via concealment of His real form which He comes to get restored to Himself by means of His own illumination.
dvaitaśāstre mataṅgādau cāpyetatsunirūpitam| adhovyāptuḥ śivasyaiva sa prakāśo vyavasthitaḥ | yena buddhimanobhūmāvapi bhāti paraṃ padam |	It has very well been elucidated in dualistic śāstras like Matanga, etc., also that it is the real illumination of consciousness of Siva which pervades downward in the world on account of which the highest state becomes manifest even on our ideational and mental planes.
dvāvapyetau samāveśau nirvikalpārṇavaṃ prati| prayāta eva tadrūḍhiṃ vinā naiva hi kiṃcana |	- Both these kinds of absorptions, i.e., śākta and āṇava, ultimately get dissolved into Bhairava because there is nothing which can stop them from reaching that height.
saṃvittiphalabhiccātra na prakalpyetyato'bravīt kalpanāyāśca mukhyatvamatraiva kila sūcitam |	In this respect, there is no scope at all for any difference between the results of the two approaches. If any difference has been contemplated, that is due to abundance of sheer imagination.
vikalpāpekṣayā yo'pi prāmāṇyaṃ prāha tanmate | tadvikalpakramopāttanirvikalpapramāṇatā|	He who admitted the validity of the optionless in comparison to the optional, in his view also, the ultimate standpoint lies therein.
ratnatattvamavidvānprāṅniścayopāyacarcanāt| anupāyāvikalpāptau ratnajña iti bhaṇyate | |	Any person completely ignorant of gems before any deliberation about their qualities before him, becomes known as the connoisseur of gems when he comes to recognise a piece of gem in the absence of any means of recognition automatically and decisively.
abhedopāyamatroktaṃ śāmbhavaṃ śāktamucyate | bhedābhedātmakopāyaṃ bhedopāyaṃ tadāṇavam |	From amongst the three approaches to Śiva, – Śāmbhava depends on non- difference, Śākta on unity-in-diversity, the ānava on difference.
ante jñāne'tra sopāye samastaḥ karmavistaraḥ| prasphuṭenaiva rūpeṇa bhāvī so'ntarbhaviṣyati | | kriyā hi nāma vijñānānnānyadvastu kramātmatām| upāyavaśataḥ prāptaṃ tatkriyeti puroditam |	Action, such as initiation, being accommodated well within knowledge, any other probable approach to Him also has every possibility of being accommodated within these three approaches. This has already been stated that action is no way different from knowledge except for involvement of the process of actualisation through the application of certain means.
samyagjñānaṃ ca muktyekakāraṇaṃ svaparasthitam | yato hi kalpanāmātraṃ svaparādivibhūtayaḥ | tulye kālpanikatve ca yadaikyasphuraṇātmakaḥ | guruḥ sa tāvadekātmā siddho muktaśca bhaṇyate |	Thorough knowledge is the sole cause of liberation irrespective of the fact whether that knowledge comes from within oneself or from anyone else, as all such deliberations are matters of sheer imagination with little ground in actuality as the same Śiva obtains outside as well as inside. Inside and outside being equivalent to each another, the teacher who is capable of imparting the sense of oneness between the Self and Śiva, he alone should be regarded as the accomplished and liberated one.
yāvānasya hi saṃtāno gurustāvatsa kīrtitaḥ | samyagjñānamayaśceti svātmanā mucyate tataḥ | tata eva svasaṃtānaṃ jñānī tārayatītyadaḥ | yuktyāgamābhyāṃ saṃsiddhaṃ tāvāneko yato muniḥ |	It is his thorough knowledge which remains transmitted from generation to generation liberating the disciples besides getting himself liberated by means of it. This is why there is the observation that the knowledgeable person liberates his whole offshoot. This statement is supported by both reasoning and tradition as he is regarded as the sole muni, contemplator of that tradition.
tenātra ye codayanti nanu jñānādvimuktatā| dīkṣādikā kriyā ceyaṃ sā kathaṃ muktaye bhavet |	Therefore, get replied those dualists who argue that there is contradiction involved in the stress on the act of initiation as a means to liberation irrespective of the scriptural injunction that it is by means of knowledge that one can get liberated and hence initiation is irrelevant.
jñānātmā seti cejjñānaṃ yatrasthaṃ taṃ vimocayet | anyasya mocane vāpi bhavetika nāsamañjasam iti te mūlataḥ kṣiptā yattvatrānyaiḥ samarthitam |	Our contention is that as knowledge obtains in the Self of the teacher, wherever he remains, therein he becomes liberated not only in himself but also remains capable of redeeming others too. This contention of ours refutes basically them as well as those who follow polytheistic views. - Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...
malo nāma kila dravyaṃ cakṣuḥ sthapaṭalādivat | tadvihantrī kriyā dīkṣā tvañjanādikakarmavat |	Mala, blemish, is an object like an obstruction put before the eye. Initiation is an act intended for removing the same obstruction as an ointment applied to the eye does.
tatpurastānniṣetsyāmo yuktyāgamavigarhitam | malamāyākarmaṇāṃ ca darśayiṣyāmahe sthitim |	This point we will make out which has been condemned by both reasoning and scripture.
evaṃ śaktitrayopāyaṃ yajjñānaṃ tatra paścimam | mūlaṃ taduttaraṃ madhyamuttarottaramādimam |	- Thus, the enlightenment of oneness of the individual with Śiva is dependent on three means, i.e., will, knowledge and action. The root one from amongst these is the knowledge while will and action are accessories.
tato'pi paramaṃ jñānamupāyādivivarjitama| ānandaśaktiviśrāntamanuttaramihocyate |	Above these and the highest is that means which does not require any means at all be it willing, knowing or acting and finds it climax in delight.
tatsvaprakāśaṃ vijñānaṃ vidyāvidyeśvarādibhiḥ| api durlabhasadbhāvaṃ śrīsiddhātantra ucyate |	That self-effulgent special knowledge emanating from the Lord of all sciences, etc., and being obtained with difficulty is stated in the Siddhā Tantra.
mālinyāṃ sūcitaṃ caitatpaṭale'ṣṭādaśe sphuṭam | na caitadaprasannena śaṃkareṇeti vākyataḥ |	It has expressly been revealed in the eighteenth Chapter the Mālini Tantra and Mālinivijayottara Tantra by Sankara out of His delight.
ityanenaiva pāṭhena mālinīvijayottare| iti jñānacatuṣkaṃ yatsiddhimuktimahodayam| tanmayā tantryate tantrālokanāmnyatra śāsane |	Sri Tantrāloka This fourfold knowledge is being embodied by me here in Tantraloka text which is a profound source of liberation as well as enjoyment in the world.
tatreha yadyadantarvā bahirvā parimṛśyate | anudghāṭitarūpaṃ tatpūrvameva prakāśate | tathānudghāṭitākārā nirvācyenātmanā prathā | saṃśayaḥ kutracidrūpe niścite sati nānyathā | etatkimiti mukhye'sminnetadaṃśaḥ suniścitaḥ | saṃśayo'stitvanāstyādidharmānudghāṭitātmakaḥ |	In this context, the novel object to be known is considered whether it is inside or outside as it has remained undisclosed as yet. The form of which has remained unrevealed so far and hence is indescribable, it is an object such as this which is the object of doubt and by no means that which is defined. In the statement, 'what is this' is the definite part but the doubt concerns whether it exists or not and hence has involved within it is qualities, etc.
kimityetasya śabdasya nādhiko'rthaḥ prakāśate | kiṃ tvanunmudritākāraṃ vastvevābhidadhātyayam |	- In the statement ‘what is this', the word this does not express anything besides what it means literally, that is, the object lying very much over there.
sthāṇurvā puruṣo veti na mukhyo'styeṣa saṃśayaḥ| bhūyaḥsthadharmajāteṣu niścayotpāda eva hi |	‘Is it anything immobile or such as a person?' In this statement the main subject is not a matter of doubt as the object concerned is revealing by itself certain features of the mobile.
āmarśanīyadvairūpyānudghāṭanavaśātpunaḥ| saṃśayaḥ sa kimityaṃśe vikalpastvanyathā sphuṭaḥ | | tenānudghāṭitātmatvabhānaprathanameva yat prathamaṃ sa ihoddeśaḥ praśnaḥ saṃśaya eva ca |	Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent... What is the matter of doubt is the problem that from within the twofold possibility of its being something mobile or immobile, none is being revealed expressly and hence the scope for the doubt. Revelation of the unrevealed is the first object of unfoldment of anything. That is known as uddeśa as well as forms the content of the question and also serves as the point of doubt.
tathānudghāṭitākārabhāvaprasaravartmanā| prasarantī svasaṃvittiḥ praṣṭrī śiṣyātmatāṃ gatā |	This is nothing else but one's own consciousness having assumed the role of the questioner and hence of the student via the path of putting up the question regarding what has remained unrevealed.
tathāntaraparāmarśaniścayātmatirohiteḥ| prasarānantarodbhūtasaṃhārodayabhāgapi |	In this state, since there is absence of both the internal contemplation and the agent of contemplation, following the end of the process, the problem remains partly unrevealed and partly expressed.
yāvatyeva bhavedbāhyaprasare prasphuṭātmani | anunmīlitarūpā sā praṣṭrī tāvati bhaṇyate |	So far as the same consciousness gets externalised in its unmanifest form, it acts as the questioner and thus is known as such accordingly.
svayamevaṃ vibodhaśca tathā praśnottarātmakaḥ | guruśiṣyapade'yeṣa dehabhedo hyatāttvikaḥ | bodho hi bodharūpatvādantarnānākṛtī sthitāḥ | bahirābhāsayatyeva drāksāmānyaviśeṣataḥ |	It is Consciousness itself which serves also as the question as well as the answer and accordingly the teacher and the taught, bodily difference being inessential. Śrī Tantrāloka It is one and the same awareness, which being internal, remains within in various forms and manifests itself outside immediately assuming the form of the general as well as the particular.
strakṣyamāṇaviśeṣāṃśākāṃkṣāyogyasya kasyacit | dharmasya sṛṣṭiḥ sāmānyasṛṣṭiḥ sā saṃśayātmikā |	Anything on the verge of manifestation in its particulars is known as an ordinary creation and remains full of doubts.
srakṣyamāṇo viśeṣāṃśo yadā tūparamettadā | nirṇayo mātṛrucito nānyathā kalpakoṭibhiḥ |	When the special part of it desired to be made manifest gets exhausted, then and then alone comes in the decision as intended by the knower and by no means any earlier no matter even after the elapse of crores of kalpas.
tasyātha vastunaḥ svātmavīryākramaṇapāṭavāt | unmudraṇaṃ tayākṛtyā lakṣaṇottaranirṇayāḥ | |	When the object gets impressed by its own potential nature after the examination of its qualities, then follows valid decision about it.
nirṇītatāvaddharmāṃśapṛṣṭhapātitayā punaḥ| bhūyo bhūyaḥ samuddeśalakṣaṇātmaparīkṣaṇam |	Following the decision about the object decided upon, the deciding factors always remain accepted as the ground for the decision in view of reference, qualities and potentialities of it again and again wherever required.
dṛṣṭānumānaupamyāptavacanādiṣu sarvataḥ | uddeśalakṣaṇāvekṣātritayaṃ prāṇināṃ sphuret |	No matter be it the case of perception, inference, comparison or scriptural evidence, there always arise doubts about reference, qualities and examination of them in all these respects.
nirvikalpitamuddeśo vikalpo lakṣaṇaṃ punaḥ | parīkṣaṇaṃ tathādhyakṣe vikalpānāṃ paramparā |	The object of decision is unspecified while its special features are the subject of decision. Perceptible instances are to serve as the evidence in the decision. This is the process of inference.
nago'yamiti coddeśo dhūmitvādagnimāniti | lakṣyaṃ vyāptyādivijñānajālaṃ tvatra parīkṣaṇam |	There is smoke emerging from it, hence there must be fire burning on it. This is the proposition about it at the moment which is required to be examined on the basis of the general rule, etc., that wherever there is smoke, there is fire.
uddeśo'yamiti prācyo gotulyo gavayābhidhaḥ | iti vā lakṣaṇaṃ śeṣaḥ parīkṣopamitau bhavet | svakāma īdṛguddeśo yajetetyasya lakṣaṇam | agniṣṭomādinetyeṣā parīkṣā śeṣavartinī |	As regards comparison, the statement is that gavaya is like a cow. In this case of comparison, what needs to be examined is the specification of attributes such as horn, udder, etc. As regards the scriptural evidence the proposition is that the aspirant of heaven should make sacrifice. In this statement, sacrifice is the precondition of attaining the heaven. The forms of sacrifice are agnistoma, etc.
vikalpasrakṣyamāṇānyarucitāṃśasahiṣṇunaḥ| vastuno yā tathātvena sṛṣṭi soddeśasaṃjñitā |	That object is known as uddesa which has the tolerance of bearing with such points which are not to the liking of the creator who is used to create optionally.
tadaiva saṃviccinute yāvataḥ strakṣyamāṇatā | yato hyakālakalitā saṃdhatte sārvakālikam | strakṣyamāṇasya yā sṛṣṭiḥ prāksṛṣṭāṃśasya saṃhṛtiḥ| anūdyamāne dharme sā saṃvillakṣaṇamucyate | tatpṛṣṭhapātibhūyoṃśasṛṣṭisaṃhāravibhramāḥ| parīkṣā kathyate mātṛrucitā kalpitāvadhiḥ |	Consciousness selects only that much as is within its capability of creation, as it, by virtue of being incalculable by time, assumes within itself all features of time. The special feature of consciousness is to bear within it both what is intended to be created as well as its state prior to the creation. As regards the definition of examination seeking to examine the special feature of the object under examination again and again the word again and again in this definition includes the event of creation and destruction both in it.
prākpaśyantyatha madhyānyā vaikharī ceti tā imāḥ| parā parāparā devī caramā tvaparātmikā |	The status of speech as parā, paśyanti and mādhyamā is the higher and the higher-lower while the last vaikhari is the lower only.
icchādi śaktitritayamidameva nigadyate | etatprāṇita evāyaṃ vyavahāraḥ pratāyate |	All these positions of it are dependent on three tendencies of the speaker, i.e., willing, knowing and doing. This kind of usage extends up to only living beings.
etatpraśnottarātmatve pārameśvaraśāsane | parasaṃbandharūpatvamabhisaṃbandhapañcake	Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent... Under the rulership of the Supreme Lord this question-answer form of discourse is of higher order dependent on five kinds of the relationship.
yathoktaṃ ratnamālāyāṃ sarvaḥ parakalātmakaḥ | mahānavāntaro divyo miśro'nyo'nyastu pañcamaḥ |	As has been stated in Ratnamālā, all these varieties are manifestations of the art of the Supreme Being Himself, no matter, be it the great, the intervening, the divine, the divine-undivine and undivine, the fifth.
bhinnayoḥ praṣṭṛtadvaktroścaikātmyaṃ yatsa ucyate| saṃbandha paratā cāsya pūrṇekātmyaprathāmayī | | anenaiva nayena syātsaṃbandhāntaramapyalam| śāstravācyaṃ phalādīnāṃ paripūrṇatvayogataḥ | |	The relationship between so mutually distant agents is its transcendence of boundaries which is a manifestation of its perfection and oneness. Relationship other than these five kinds are also explicable as per the principle referred to here as, for instance, whatever is to be stated by the scriptures concerning the result, etc., of the preferences by virtue of admittance of the principle of perfection.
itthaṃ saṃvidiyaṃ devī svabhāvādeva sarvadā| uddeśāditrayaprāṇā sarvaśāstrasvarūpiṇī | tatrocyate puroddeśaḥ pūrvajānujabhedavān| vijñānabhidgatopāyaḥ paropāyastṛtīyakaḥ | |	Thus, it is the goddess of Consciousness Herself by Her nature of manifestation that takes the form of uddeśa, laksana and pariksā which are the essential steps of deliberation admitted by the scriptures, as She is all the scriptures within Herself. Uddeśa is of two kinds: pūrvaja, prior and anuja, subsequent.
śāktopāyo naropāyaḥ kālopāyo'tha saptamaḥ| cakrodayo'tha deśādhvā tattvādhvā tattvabhedanam | kalādyadhvādhvopayoga śaktipātatirohitī | dīkṣopakramaṇaṃ dīkṣā sāmayī pautrike vidhau | prameyaprakriyā sūkṣmā dīkṣā sadyaḥ samutkramaḥ | tulādīkṣātha pārokṣī liṅgoddhāro'bhiṣecanam | |	The prior are thirty-seven, namely, vijñânabhid, anupāya, paropāya, śāktopāya, naropāya, kālopāya, cakropāya, deśadhvā, tattvabheda, kalādhvā, bhuvana, śaktipāta, tirodhāna, dīkṣopakrama dīkṣā, samaya-dikṣā, prameyārtha prakriyā, sūkṣmā- diksā, sadyah samutkramana diksā, tulā diksā, paroksā diksā, lingoddhāra, abhiseka, antyesti, śrāddha, sesavrttti-nirūpana, lingārcā, parva, rahasyacaryā, mantraugna-mandala, mudrikā-vidhi, svātmaikya anupravesa, sāstra-melana, āyāti kathā, śāstropādeyatva-nirūpaṇa.
āyātikathanaṃ śāstropādeyatvanirūpaṇam| iti saptādhikāmenāṃ triṃśataṃ yaḥ sadā budhaḥ |	- The aspirant who would remain practising on these thirty-seven uddeśas daily Difference Between Consciousness and Reality Apparent...

ātmā saṃvitprakāśasthitiranavayavā saṃvidityāttaśakti vrātaṃ tasya svarūpaṃ sa ca nijamahasaśchādanād baddharūpaḥ| ātmajyotiḥsvabhāvaprakaṭanavidhinā tasya mokṣaḥ sa cāyaṃ | citrākārasya citraḥ prakaṭita iha tatsaṃgraheṇārtha eṣaḥ |	The subject of our discussion here in short is the illumination of the Self which is inherently self-revealing and it is in this nature of it that lies its liberation. Thus, it is a compact form of picture which reveals its context as per the understanding of its connoisseur.
mithyājñānaṃ timiramasamān dṛṣṭidoṣānprasūte tatsadbhāvādvimalamapi tadbhāti mālinyaṃdhāma| yattu prekṣyaṃ dṛśi parigataṃ taimirīṃ doṣamudrāṃ dūraṃ runddhetprabhavatu kathaṃ tatra mālinyaśaṅkā |	Unreal knowledge is darkness and generator of the sense of inequality and blemishes of sight. Under its effect, the absolutely blemishless Self appears to be the abode of blemishes. Whatever blemish may arise in course of perception, the aspirant should ward it off, since there is no scope for any doubt about blemish in the Self.
bhāvavrāta haṭhājjanasya hṛdayānyākramya yannartayan bhaṅgībhirvividhābhirātmahṛdayaṃ pracchādya saṃkrīḍase| yastvāmāha jaḍaṃ jaḍaḥ sahṛdayaṃmanyatvaduḥ śikṣito manye'muṣya jaḍātmatā stutipadaṃ tvatsāmyasabhāvanāt |	O group of ideas! I praise you all on account of your making the hearts of people dance helplessly having covered their real form and thus displaying various false moves sportively. He who being uneducated himself called you sensible, I understand, he is only indirectly praising you with the possibility in his mind that in this way he would have the prospect of becoming equal to you.
iha galitamalā parāvarajñā śivasadbhāvamayā adhikriyante | guravaḥ pravicāraṇe yatastaviphalā dveṣakalaṃkahāniyācyā |	Here in the śāstra are being authorised those serious aspirants who have got themselves rid of all blemishes, have thus become cognisant of the secret of this lower world as well as of the other higher world and have become assured of the entity of Śiva.
tantrāloke'bhinavaracite'mutra vijñānasattā bhedodgāraprakaṭanapaṭāvāhnike'sminsamāptiḥ |	Those who would fail in this venture, they may observe, no matter, whatever! Here ends the first Chapter of Tantrāloka written by Abhinavagupta dealing with the precise difference between consciousness and the reality as apparent to the onlooker.
huna | yattatrāyaṃ padamaviratānuttarajñaptirūpaṃ tannirṇetuṃ prakaraṇamidamārabhe'haṃ dvitīyam |	CHAPTER - Deliberation on The Highest Goal of Life What is higher in its attributes than the other one is characterised as better than that. Now I am starting to write this second chapter in order to decide which is the best path leading to the understanding of Śiva.
anupāyaṃ hi yadrūpaṃ ko'rtho deśanayātra vai | sakṛtsyāddeśanā paścādanupāyatvamucyate | anupāyamidaṃ tattvamityupāyaṃ vinā kutaḥ | svayaṃ tu teṣāṃ tattādṛk kiṃ brūmaḥ kila tānprati |	What is the use of any instruction in that way of understanding which does not require any instruction at all! It may need only one-time instruction followed by futility of instruction known as anupāya. This Reality is such as does not need anything else to bring it home. If anyone questions the validity of this Śiva's Reality, we have to tell them that this is like this.
yaccaturdhoditaṃ rūpaṃ vijñānasya vibhorasau | svabhāva eva mantavyaḥ sa hi nityodito vibhuḥ |	That there are four ways to the understanding, namely, anupāya, śāmbhava, śākta and ānava, of that all-pervading Lord, that has to be understood as His very nature since He is eternally manifest in the form of the world.
etāvadbhirasaṃkhyātaiḥ svabhāvairyatprakāśate | ke'pyaṃśāṃśikayā tena viśantyanye niraṃśataḥ |	That He reveals Himself via these four methods or even numberless ways, there are some people who understand Him gradually part by part and some other persons who enter into His essence wholly in one and the same move.
tatrāpi cābhyupāyādisāpekṣānyatvayogataḥ| upāyasyāpi no vāryā tadanyatvādvicitratā |	There as well, whether one enters into Him via a particular method or in any other way, in either case what necessarily needs to be experienced is the wondrousness of the experience.
tatra ye nirmalātmāno bhairavīyāṃ svasaṃvidam | nirupāyāmupāsīnāstadvidhiḥ praṇigadyate |	In that case, those who are blemishless within, and have become in their consciousness pervaded by the awareness of Bhairava and have taken to the path of pathlessness, that path is now to be taken up for deliberation.
tatra tāvatkriyāyogo nābhyupāyatvamarhati | sa hi tasmātsamudbhūtaḥ pratyuta pravibhāvyate |	In that context, kriyā yoga is such as does not deserve any methodology to be ascribed to it. It is not only an offshoot of awareness of Bhairava but is also effulgent with that sense.
jñaptāvupāya eva syāditi cejjñaptirucyate | prakāśatvaṃ svaprakrāśe tacca tatrānyataḥ katham |	Deliberation on The Highest Goal of Life If knowledgeability were always to presuppose its being made aware by some means other than itself, how would be explicable the self-luminosity of anything? Consciousness is self-luminous.
saṃvittattvaṃ svaprakāśamityasminkiṃ tu yuktibhiḥ | tadabhāve bhavedviśvaṃ jaḍatvādaprakāśakam | yāvānupāyo bāhyaḥ syādāntaro vāpi kaścana | sa sarvastanmukhaprekṣī tatropāyatvabhākkatham |	Were it not self-luminous, the whole world would turn inconscient and hence would become blind darkness. Irrespective of the fact whether an approach be external or internal, it always presupposes and depends on consciousness and hence cannot serve as an approach in the determination of the nature of consciousness. Leave attention apart.
tyajāvadhānāni nanu kva nāma dhatse'vadhānaṃ vicinu svayaṃ tat | pūrṇe'vadhānaṃ na hi nāma yuktaṃ nāpūrṇamabhyeti ca satyabhāvam |	Think within yourself where to direct your attention. It is impossible to direct attention to the whole all at once together while incomplete attention cannot reach the Reality.
tenāvadhānaprāṇasya bhāvanāde pare pathi | bhairavīye kathaṃkāraṃ bhavetsākṣādupāyatā |	As such, in this higher path of Bhairava there is no relevance of direct use of ideation bhāvanā.
ye'pi sākṣādupāyena tadrūpaṃ praviviñcate | nūnaṃ te sūryasaṃvittyai khadyotādhitsavo jaḍāḥ |	Those who choose directly the form of Siva Himself as a means to the understanding of anything, verily those ignorant people wish to make use of the night worm of luminosity khadyota for searching out the sun.
kiṃ ca yāvadidaṃ bāhyamāntaropāyasaṃmatam | tatprakāśātmatāmātraṃ śivasyaiva nijaṃ vapuḥ | |	Moreover, whatever all this external or internal approach of understanding Him be, all this is just an illumination of the body of Siva.
nīlaṃ pītaṃ sukhamiti prakāśaḥ kevalaḥ śivaḥ | amuṣminparamādvaite prakāśātmani ko'paraḥ |	Be it blue, yellow, experience of comfort, all these are simply flashes of the illumination of Śiva.
upāyopeyabhāvaḥ syātprakāśa kevalaṃ hi saḥ | idaṃ dvaitamayaṃ bheda idamadvaitamityapi | prakāśavapurevāyaṃ bhāsate parameśvaraḥ |	Who else can prevail in this Śiva's state of non-dualism? How can also be established here the relationship of approach and the target of approach? - No matter, the case be that of dualism or non-dualism, it is the Supreme Lord Siva Himself who is manifesting His luminosity all around out of His self- luminous personality.
asyāṃ bhūmau sukhaṃ duḥkhaṃ bandho mokṣaścitirjaḍa ghaṭakumbhavadekārthāḥ śabdāste'pyekameva ca |	On this higher ground, pleasure and pain, bondage and liberation, consciousness and inconscience, all mean one and the same thing like pitcher and jar and are mere words and amongst themselves also they are only vocables.
prakāśe hyaprakāśāṃśaḥ kathaṃ nāma prakāśatām | prakāśamāne tasminvā tadddvaitāstasya lopitāḥ | aprakāśe'tha tasminvā vastutā kathamucyate | na prakāśaviśeṣatvamata evopapadyate | ata ekaprakāśo'yamiti vāde'tra susthite | dūrādāvāritāḥ satyaṃ vibhinnajñānavādinaḥ |	Deliberation on The Highest Goal of Life How can non-luminous part subsist along with the luminous such as the colours blue, yellow are supposed ? If the same as well were supposed to be luminous in itself, there would be absence of any duality. If the Supreme Being were to be taken as non-luminous, how can we speak of the existence of anything at all particularly of any special kind of luminosity? On non-dualism having thus been established, pluralists get warded off truly from a distance. Darkness having thus, been eliminated, what remains is only luminosity.
prakāśamātramuditamaprakāśaniṣedhanāt | ekaśabdasya na tvarthaḥ saṃkhyā cidvyaktibhedabhāk |	Use of the word eka, one, in the previous verse is, thus, significatory of 'only' and not of any number as such.
naiṣa śaktirmahādevī na paratrāśrito yataḥ | na caiṣa śaktimāndevo na kasyāpyāśrayo yataḥ |	There is neither force nor the possessor of the force on which the force may have to depend.
naiṣa dhyeyo dhyātrabhāvānna dhyātā dhyeyavarjanāt| na pūjya pūjakābhāvātpūjyābhāvānna pūjakaḥ |	Likewise, there is neither the object of meditation because there is no one to serve as the agent of meditation. Similarly, there is no one to be worshipped, since there is no one to serve as the worshipper either.
na mantro na ca mantryo'sau na ca mantrayitā prabhuḥ | na dīkṣā dīkṣako vāpi na dīkṣāvānmaheśvaraḥ |	The Lord Himself does not need to serve as the giver of mantra. The Supreme Lord does not need to serve as the initiator either since He does not assume this role Himself.
sthānāsanānirodhārghasaṃdhānāvāhanādikam | visarjanāntaṃ nāstyatra kartṛkarmakriyojjhite |	- As the distinction of the doer, action and activity are left out from this affair of pure illumination, sthāna, āsana, obstruction of irrelevant ideas, cherishing of the desirable, perusal of it, invocation of the deity and dispersal of all at the end, etc.
na sanna cāsatsadasanna ca tannobhayojjhitam | durvijñeyā hi sāvasthā kimapyetadanuttaram |	Here is neither anything in existence nor non-existing, neither for denial nor for assertion. This state is difficult to understand as it is unique.
ayamityavabhāso hi yo bhāvo'vacchidātmakaḥ sa eva ghaṭavalloke saṃstathā naiṣa bhairavaḥ |	Wherever there is the assertion, like, this is the pitcher', there are certain limitations put around the object, which, however, is not applicable to Bhairava.
asattvaṃ cāprakāśatvaṃ na kutrāpyupayogitā | viśvasya jīvitaṃ satyaṃ prakāśaikātmakaśca saḥ | ābhyāmeva tu hetubhyāṃ na dvyātmā na dvayojjhitaḥ| sarvātmanā hi bhātyeṣa kena rūpeṇa mantryatām |	- There is no utility of the use of the term non-existence here or of darkness. It is the positively existing basis of the world as well as of its luminosity. Deliberation on The Highest Goal of Life It is on account of these two characteristic features of it that it is neither dualistic nor absolutely rid of the state of dualism. It flourishes as the Self of all, no matter in whatever form one were to think of it.
śrīmattriśirasi proktaṃ parajñānasvarūpakam| śaktyā garbhāntarvartinyā śaktigarbhaṃ paraṃ padam |	It has also been characterised in the scripture known as Trisiras that the supreme essence is of the form of Supernal Knowledge. It embodies force as the highest state of being embodied in It.
na bhāvo nāpyabhāvo na dvayaṃ vācāmagocarāt | akathyapadavīrūḍhaṃ śaktisthaṃ śaktivarjitam |	The Supreme State of Being is neither positive nor negative, neither both as it is indescribable. It is that state which words fail to recount, though it lies within the range of force and yet remains far from use of that force.
iti ye rūḍhasaṃvittiparamārthapavitritāḥ| anuttarapathe rūḍhāste'bhyupāyāniyantritāḥ |	Those who have ascended the state of pure consciousness, they have reached the state higher than which there is no one else and they have no other means of elevation to follow.
teṣāmidaṃ samābhāti sarvato bhāvamaṇḍalam | purasthameva saṃvittibhairavāgnivilāpitam |	For them, the entire world appears from all around as a circle of sheer ideas ignited by the consciousness of the fire of Bhairava while they themselves are sitting at home.
eteṣāṃ sukhaduḥkhāṃśaśaṃkātaṃkavikalpanāḥ | nirvikalpaparāveśamātraśeṣatvamāgatāḥ |	Śrī Tantrāloka For such persons pleasure, pain, suspense, doubt, terror etc. have got melt down into theinfinitude of existence-consciousnessandbliss of the essence ofŚiva.
eṣāṃ na mantro na dhyānaṃ na pūjā nāpi kalpanā | na samayyādikācāryaparyantaḥ ko'pi vibhramaḥ |	For them there is no utility of any mantra, meditation, worship, idea, time or even the teacher since all these have got rendered into sheer illusion.
samastayantraṇātantratroṭanāṭaṃkadharmiṇaḥ nānugrahātparaṃ kiñciccheṣavṛttau prayojanam |	One who has broken away from all sorts of constraints, he has nothing else to do in the rest of his life except for waiting for the grace to be bestowed upon him.
svaṃ kartavyaṃ kimapi kalayaṃlloka eṣa prayatnānno | pārārthyaṃ prati ghaṭayate kāṃcana svapravṛttim | yastu dhvastākhilabhavamalo bhairavībhāvapūrṇa kṛtyaṃ tasya sphuṭamidamiyallokakartavyamātram | |	The aspirant who has reached close to liberation may think of doing something deliberately on his own accord, which, however, does not matter anything in regard to the supramental goal. He, however, who has got all worldly blemishes wiped out from his psyche and thus has completely been filled with the idea of Bhairava has nothing to accomplish except for what he may be required to do to survive in this world as a living being.
taṃ ye paśyanti tādrūpyakrameṇāmalasaṃvidaḥ | te'pi tadrūpiṇastāvatyevāsyānugrahātmatā |	Those who see such persons who have become completely cleared of blemishes Deliberation on The Highest Goal of Life from their psyche by virtue of their identification with Siva, they, too, become like him and it is in such an effectiveness of him to his viewers that lay their graciousness.
etattattvaparijñānaṃ mukhyaṃ yāgādi kathyate | dīkṣāntaṃ vibhunā śrīmatsiddhayogīśvarīmate |	Understanding of this kind of effectiveness of the Bhairavibhāva transformation into Bhairava, is the main purpose of sacrifice, etc. according to Siddha Yogiśvari view as therein also gets accomplished initiation by the all-pervading Lord Himself.
sthaṇḍilāduttaraṃ tūraṃ tūrāduttarataḥ paṭaḥ | paṭāl̤yānaṃ tato dhyeyaṃ tataḥ syāddhāraṇottarā | |	More essential than the site of sacrifice is the utilisation of the sacrificial vessels known as tūra. Higher than tūra is the status of the cloth used in the sacrifice. Higher than the cloth is the status of meditation accomplished in course of the sacrifice.
tato'pi yogajaṃ rūpaṃ tato'pi jñānamuttaram | jñānena hi mahāsiddho bhavedyogīśvarastviti |	Higher than dhāranā is the status of the by-products of yoga while higher than the status of the by-products of yoga is the status of the knowledge acquired through yoga as by virtue of the knowledge the Yogiśvara may get elevated into a mahāsiddha, highly accomplished yogin.
so'pi svātantryadhāmnā cedapyanirmalasaṃvidām| anugrahaṃ cikīrṣustadbhāvinaṃ vidhimāśrayet |	If a teacher wants to shed his grace on anyone whose psyche has not been cleared of its blemishes, he should make use of a method which might be suitable to him freely.
anugrāhyānusāreṇa vicitraḥ sa ca kathyate | parāparādyupāyaughasaṃkīrṇatvavibhedataḥ | tadarthameva cāsyāpi parameśvararūpiṇaḥ | tadabhyupāyaśāstrādiśravaṇādhyayanādaraḥ | |	That method of initiation and enlightenment is said to be peculiar in view of being modified due to limitations of the person concerned. Its peculiarity lies in its being a combination of the higher Sāmbhava method and the lower ānava. In view of the same limitations, should be designed the course of his scriptural study, etc. which are as if the Supreme Being Himself for him.
nahi tasya svatantrasya kāpi kutrāpi khaṇḍanā| nānirmalacitaḥ puṃso'nugrahastvanupākaḥ |	The grace to be shed on a person whose inner being has not become cleared of all blemishes need not follow strictly the cut and dry rule already laid down in scriptures.
śrīmadūrmimahāśāstre siddhasaṃtānarūpake| idamuktaṃ tathā śrīmatsomānandādidaiśikaiḥ |	This has been specified in the Urmimahā śāstra which represents the entire tradition of siddhas. The same has been held by highly venerable teachers like Somānanda and his followers.

idamanuttaradhāmavivecakaṃ vigalitaupayika kṛtamāhnikam |	Thus has been formed the Chapter meant for deliberating on the highest goal of life by over exceeding the limits of scriptural devices.
prakāśamātraṃ yatproktaṃ bhairavīyaṃ paraṃ mahaḥ | tatra svatantratāmātramadhikaṃ pravivicyate |	CHAPTER - Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu As has been characterised as just Light, that refers to the Supreme Illumination of Bhairava. The autonomy of that Illumination is going to be discussed further in this Chapter.
yaḥ prakāśaḥ sa sarvasya prakāśatvaṃ prayacchati | na ca tadvyatirekyasti viśvaṃ sadvāvabhāsate |	That Light offers its luminosity to all. Apart from that Light, there is nothing in the world. Indeed, whatever is there in the world is the luminosity of the Light.
ato'sau parameśānaḥ svātmavyomanyanargalaḥ | ityata sṛṣṭisaṃhārāḍambarasya pradarśakaḥ | nirmale makure yaddhānti bhūmijalādayaḥ | amiśrāstadvadekasmiṃścinnāthe viśvavṛttayaḥ |	The Supreme Lord acts as the demonstrator of the show comprising both creation and withdrawal of the phenomenal world automatically and spontaneously on the space of His Self: Just as earth, water, etc. get reflected in a clean mirror even so all events and objects of the world get reflected unmixed in the one Lord Himself.
sadṛśaṃ bhāti namanadarpaṇāmbaravāriṣu | tathā hi nirmale rūpe rūpamevāvabhāsate |	This fact goes to prove that cleanliness is the criterion of reflection of anything in its exactitude.
pracchannarāgiṇī kāntapratibimbitasundaram | darpaṇaṃ kucakumbhābhyāṃ spṛśantyapi na tṛpyati |	A beloved seeing the handsome reflection of her lover secretly in a mirror becomes gladdened, but getting mesmerised with the perception when she tries to get a touch of him with her emerging breast, she does not find any satisfaction at all.
na hi sparśo'sya vimalo rūpameva tathā yataḥ | nairmalyaṃ cātiniviḍasajātīyaikasaṃgati |	This is due to the fact that the touch of the mirror is not blemishless as is its viewing. That blemishlessness in this context lies in the arrangement of its atoms of one and the same nature in complete proximity of one another.
svasminnabhedādbhinnasya darśanakṣamataiva yā | asyaktasvaprakāśasya nairmalyaṃ tadgurūditam | nairmalyaṃ mukhyamekasya saṃvinnāthasya sarvataḥ | aṃśāṃśikātaḥ kvāpyanyadvimalaṃ tattadicchayā |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Blemishlessness, nairmalaya, in this context means the capacity to see something different from oneself as identical to oneself, this has been stated by my great teacher, namely, Utpaladeva. The main source of such a blemishlessness lies in the Lord of consciousness everywhere which, however, is partly manifest as per His wish everywhere else.
bhāvanā yatpratīghāti vapurmāyātmakaṃ hi sat | teṣāmevāsti sadvidyāmayaṃ tvapratighātakam |	That body is illusory which is obstructive of entities. Out of the same but opposite of them is that body which is of the form of the real knowledgeability as well as not obstructive.
tadevamubhayākāramavabhāsaṃ prakāśayan | vibhāti varado bimbapratibimbadṛśākhile |	The Lord Himself, as the bestower of the gift, assuming the form of both the kinds of images, that is sad-vidyātmaka and asad-vidyātmaka, flourishes everywhere as the reflector and the reflection.
yastvāha netratejāṃsi svacchātpratiphalantyalam | viparyasya svakaṃ vaktraṃ gṛhṇantīti sa pṛcchyate | dehādanyatra yattejastadadhiṣṭhāturātmanaḥ| tenaiva tejasā jñatve ko'rthaḥ syāddarpaṇena tu |	The scholar who has said that it is the luminosity of the eyes which due to its cleanliness is reflected back in a reversed form and hence there is no role of any Lord at all here , is being asked hereby to explain what he means by getting reflected back ? The luminosity which is operative there as different from that of the body belongs to the owner of the body himself, if it is the owner himself who is serving as the recipient of the reflection, then he ought to do his job by himself without any necessity of the mirror.
viparyastaistu tejobhirgrāhakātmatvamāgataiḥ rūpaṃ dṛśyeta vadane nije na makurāntare | svamukhe sparśavaccaitadrūpaṃ bhāyānmametyalam | na tvasya spṛśyabhinnasya vedyaikāntasvarūpiṇaḥ | rūpasaṃsthānamātraṃ tatsparśagandharasādibhiḥ | nyagbhūtaireva tadyuktaṃ vastu tatpratibimbitam |	On the assumption that it is the reversed form of the luminosity which is received by the recipient as his own, the image ought to be seen on his face itself and not in the mirror. In that case he ought to feel the image of his face on the face itself through touch and own it as his and by no means as entirely different from touch and just as an object of sheer awareness. He ought not to find the reflection as source of sheer form from which touch, smell, taste, etc., all have disappeared such is what is known as reflection.
nyagbhāvo grāhyatābhāvāttadabhāvo'pramāṇataḥ | sa cārthasaṃyamābhāvātso'pyādarśe'navasthiteḥ |	Disappearance of touch, etc., from the reflection is due to their non-receptivity while the non-receptivity is due to its invalidity which in its turn is owing to absence of contact with the actual object which is due to instability of the mirror.
ata eva gurutvādirdharmo naitasya lakṣyate | nahyādarśe saṃsthito'sau taddṛṣṭau sa upāyakaḥ |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu This is why qualities like weight, etc., are not carried by the image. This is due to the mirror’s reflectivity being conducive only to form and not of any other quality of tangibility.
tasmāttu naiṣa bhedena yadbhāti tata ucyate | ādhārastatra tūpāyo dīpadṛsaṃvidaḥ kramāt |	This is why the reflection is not reflected as separate from the reflecting mirror. The mirror serves as the basis of the reflection while lamp, eyesight, etc.
dīpacakṣurvibodhānāṃ kāṭhinyābhāvataḥ param | sarvataścāpi nairmalyānna vibhādarśavatpṛthak |	There is reflectivity in the flame of lamp, eye and awareness no doubt but in these there is lack of stability and in awareness in particular there is all-round cleanliness and hence reflection is formed only in the mirror and not in these accessories as a separate entity.
etacca devadevena darśitaṃ bodhavṛddhaye | mūḍhānāṃ vastu bhavati tato'pyanyatra nāpyalam |	This has been shown by the Lord of the gods for the sake of bringing awareness to the ignorant for whom real is only what is tangible and nothing else.
pratīghāti svatantraṃ no na sthāyyasthāyi cāpi na| svacchasyaiṣa kasyāpi mahimeti kṛpālunā |	Objectscasting their reflection are not independent. Nor can they be characterised as absolutely stable or unstable.
na deśo no rūpaṃ na ca samayayogo na parimā na cānyonyāsaṃgo na ca tadapahānirna ghanatā| na cāvastutvaṃ syānna ca kimapi sāraṃ nijamiti dhruvaṃ moha śāmyediti niradiśaddarpaṇavidhiḥ |	The illustration of the reflection of the mirror is adduced here with a view to making subside the sticky illusion of the attachment towards the worldly life by making it out that the reflection has no footing, no form, no timing, no valid no attachment, neither any loss nor intensity, neither anything unreal nor any substantivity.
ityaṃ pradarśite'mutra pratibimbanavartmani | śabdasya pratibimbaṃ yat pratiśrutketi bhaṇyate |	In this exposition of the mode of reflection, the reflection of the word is called pratisrutkā.
na cāsau śabdajaḥ śabdaḥ āgacchattvena saṃśravāt| tenaiva vaktrā dūrasthaiḥ śabdasyā śravaṇādapi |	The sound of the word heart is not a product of the word itself as it is heard best by one approaching the speaker and faintly from a distance. So is the case with the sound produced by a covered cooking pot having a certain hole in it.
piṭhirādipidhānāṃśaviśiṣṭachidrasaṃgatau | citratvāccāsya śabdasya pratibimbaṃ mukhādivat | idamanyasya vedyasya rūpamityavabhāsate | yathādarśe tathā kenāpyuktamākarṇaye tviti | niyamāda bimbasāṃmukhyaṃ pratibimbasya yattataḥ | tanmadhyagāḥ pramātāraḥśṛṇvanti pratiśabdakam |	It is on the nature of the sound that the state of the cooking is understood in the same way as one understands the sense of the communication from the look of the face. - As in a mirror, one feels that the image belongs to a certain person, even so in the case of hearing the person concerned feels that he is listening to the words of a person acquainted to him. Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu As it is essential for one to view the reflection directly in front of a mirror, even so it is essential in the case of hearing that the listener be in direct reach of the sound.
mukhyagrahaṃ tvapi vinā pratibimbagraho bhavet | svapaścātsthaṃ priyaṃ paśyeṭṭaṅkitaṃ mukure vapuḥ |	One can see the reflection without seeing the origin of the reflection. This statement is elucidated by the lover standing behind the beloved and seen reflected in the mirror by her.
sāṃmukhyaṃ cocyate tādṛgdarpaṇābhedasaṃsthite | ataḥ kūpādipiṭhirākāśe tatpratibimbatam | vaktrākāśaṃ saśabdaṃ sadbhāti tatparavaktṛvat |	In this case, the confrontation is explicable in terms of the sense of identity between the original and its reflection. Necessity of the confrontation between the sense organ and the object sensed finds its elucidation in the event in which the word spoken by the speaker from a closely covered location such as a well, etc., appears as someone else's.
yathā cādarśapāścātyabhāgastho vetti no mukham | tathā tathāvidhākāśapaścātstho vetti na dhvanim | śabdo na cānabhivyaktaḥ pratibimbati taddhruvam | abhivyakti śrutī tasya samakālaṃ dvitīyake |	As one lying behind the mirror does not see the reflection of the face reflected in it, even so the hearer lying beyond the range of hearing does not hear the sound. The word, if not uttered, does not reflect at all. Utterance and hearing of it follow together which does not happen in the case of the hand and its shadow.
itthaṃ pradarśite'mutra pratibimbasatattvake | prakṛtaṃ brūmahe tatra pratibimbanamarhati |	After explaining the nature of reflection over there, now we come to speak about the original topic.
śabdo nabhasi sānande sparśadhāmani sundaraḥ | sparśo'nyo'pi dṛḍhāghātaśūlaśītādikodbhavaḥ |	Word lies in space which is delightful and is the beautiful abode of its inherence. As distinct from it, touch is born of forceful strike of something pinching, cold, hot, etc.
parasthaḥ pratibimbatvātsvadehoddhūlanākaraḥ |	Its location lies in someone else's bodily striking as it is deflective in nature.
na caiṣa mukhyastatkāryapāramparyāprakāśanāt |	This is why it does not remain at its main point of origin, involve, as it does, a series of events giving birth to one after the other.
evaṃ ghrāṇāntare gandho raso dantodake sphuṭaḥ |	- In this way, the sensation of smell lies inside the nose and that of taste in the saliva effusing out of the teeth.
yathā ca rūpaṃ pratibimbitaṃ dṛśorna cakṣuṣānyena vinā hi lakṣyate | tathā rasasparśanasaurabhādika na lakṣyate'kṣeṇa vinā sthitaṃ tvapi | na cāntare sparśanadhāmani sthitaṃ | bahispṛśonyākṣadhiyaḥ sa gocaraḥ |	As any figure although reflected in the eye cannot be seen without the cooperation of the inner being or help of anyone else's eye; that is the case with taste, touch, smell, etc. inasmuch as here, too, cooperation of the inner being is a must though not that of anyone else's eye as all these are felt within oneself. Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu This is so on account of the location of these sensations being inaccessible to anyone else though these, too, theoretically being liable to external perception.
na tu smṛtānmānasagocarādṛtā bhavetkriyā sā kila vartamānataḥ | ataḥ sthitaḥ sparśavarastadindriye samāgataḥ sanviditastathākriyaḥ | | asaṃbhave bāhyagatasya tādṛśaḥ sva eva tasminpratibimbatastathā | karoti tāṃ sparśavaraḥ sukhātmikāṃ sa cāpi kasyāmapi nāḍisaṃtatau | |	The inner organ of knowledge, antah karana, produces effect in accordance with the sense organ being in its proximity in the act of reflection. On account of being a matter of memory, any action of that nature has nothing to do with the present and hence remains ineffective practically though its touch may be brought to the sense organ concerned to recreate the touch by way of remembrance ineffectively. In the case of absence of the object concerned in the external world at the appointed moment, the subject's own self reflects itself there in the world and gladdens the close touch of the sense via the memory in the nervous system.
tena saṃvittimakure viśvamātmānamarpayat| nāthasya bhāsate'muṣya vimalāṃ viśvarūpatām |	Therefore, what one needs to do is to submit oneself along with the entire world to the Lord via the mirror of consciousness inside which is being reflected the clean universality of Him.
yathā ca gandharūpaspṛgrasādyāḥ pratibimbitāḥ | tadādhāroparāgeṇa bhānti khaḍge mukhādivat | tathā viśvamidaṃ bodhe pratibimbitamāśrayet | prakāśatvasvatantratvaprabhṛtiṃ dharmavistaram |	As smell, form, touch, taste, etc. are being reflected in the world along with the attribute of the canvas of their reflection like the particular shapes of the mouth reflected on the blade of a sword, even so the aspirant should accept the world in his awareness along with the luminosity and autonomy of the consciousness etc.
| yathā ca sarvataḥ svacche sphaṭike sarvato bhavet | pratibimbaṃ tathā bodhe sarvataḥ svacchatājuṣi |	- As reflection appears all-round clean on such a piece of crystal, even so should appear the world in such an awareness.
atyantasvacchatā sā yatsvākṛtyanavabhāsanam | ataḥ svacchatamo bodho na ratnaṃ tvākṛtigrahāt | |	Perfect cleanliness lies there where one's own figure does not find reflection. This is why awareness can be absolutely clean but not any gem as it receives one's own reflection.
pratibimbaṃ ca bimbena bāhyasthena samarpyate | tasyaiva pratibimbatve kiṃ bimbamavaśiṣyatām | yadvāpi kāraṇaṃ kiṃcid bimbatvenābhiṣicyate | tadapi pratibimbatvameti bodhe'nyathā tvasat |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Reflection is deposited in the mirror by the reflected object lying outside. When it gets completely reflected in the mirror to be regarded as its perfect representative what else of it remains there in the world outside? Whatever be regarded as the cause of the reflection, that also is eventually a mere reflection on the canvas of awareness and otherwise is nothing but unreal.
itthametatsvasaṃvittidṛḍhanyāyāstrarakṣitam| sāmrājyameva viśvatra pratibimbasya jṛmbhate |	Thus, it is by virtue of the sound logic of mistaking the reflection as the original that is flourishing the empire of reflection all over world.
nanu bimbasya virahe pratibimbaṃ kathaṃ bhavet| kiṃ kurmoṃ dṛśyate taddhi nanu tad bimbamucyatām |	Now the question arises as to how can reflection be possible without the original object? But, what can we do? It looks like that. Therefore, now, we may call the reflection itself as the original object.
naivaṃ tallakṣaṇābhāvād bimbaṃ kila kimucyate | anyāmiśraṃ svatantraṃ sadbhāsamānaṃ mukhaṃ yathā | svarūpānapahānena pararūpasadṛkṣatām| pratibimbātmatāmāhuḥ khaḍgādarśatalādivat |	As an answer to this problem that which remains unmixed with anything else and appears as actual in its own capacity, that is the original, as can be elucidated by the face. This definition, however, as bearing out the form of anything different from it without any loss to its own real form is applicable to the reflection as well. Examples are the surface of the sword and the mirror.
uktaṃ ca sati bāhye'pi dhīrekānekavedanāt | anekasadṛśā'kārā na tvaneketi sogataiḥ |	It is also maintained in Yogācāra Buddhism that in matters of the external world also, the intellect, though assuming the form of different objects in course of their perception, does not become many.
nanvitthaṃ pratibimbasya lakṣaṇaṃ kiṃ taducyate | anyavyāmiśraṇāyogāttadbhedāśakyabhāsanam|	Now, is being put forth the definition of a reflection: Reflection is said to be that entity which without getting mixed up with anything else manifests itself with the aid of something else without the aid of which it cannot manifest itself.
pratibimbamiti prāhurdarpaṇe vadanaṃ yathā |	Example of it is the reflection of the face in the mirror.
bodhamiśramidaṃ bodhādbhedenāśakya bhāsanam| paratattvādi bodhe kiṃ pratibimbaṃ na bhaṇyate | |	The world is mixed up with its awareness as it cannot appear as anyway separate from the awareness. Is the reflection not called here as the eventual reality ? This is the arrangement of the definition of things here.
lakṣaṇasya vyavasthaiṣā'kasmāccedbimbamucyatām | prājñā vastuni yujyante na tu sāmayike dhvanau |	There is no harm in naming reflections as the actual objects altogether. Wise people concern themselves with the actuality and do by no means permit themselves to be influenced by rumours.
nanu na pratibimbasya vinā bimbaṃ bhavetsthitiḥ | kiṃ tataḥ pratibimbe hi bimbaṃ tādātmyavṛtti na | ataśca lakṣaṇasyāsya proktasya tadasaṃbhave | na hānirhetumātre tu praśnoyaṃ paryavasyati |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Now, to take up the problem of the possibility and impossibility of the reflection without the original object. The question is does the original object not lie in its identical form in its reflection? Therefore, if this characteristic feature, as presented herewith, does not obtain in the reflection, it does not cause any harm as it gets reduced only to causality.
tatrāpi ca nimittākhye nopādāne kathaṃcana| nimittakāraṇānāṃ ca kadācitkvāpi saṃbhavaḥ | |	Out of two kinds of cause, what is operative in this case is not the material but only the efficient which incidentally can be applicable anywhere.
ata eva purovartinyāloke smaraṇādinā | nimittena dhanenāstu saṃkrāntadayitākṛtiḥ |	For example, a lover can see the image of his beloved reflected in the light ahead of him owing to the intensity of her remembrance in him.
anyathā saṃvidārūḍhā kāntā vicchedayoginī | kasmādbhāti na vai saṃvid vicchedaṃ puratogatā |	Otherwise the beloved, who has been separated from her lover, when coming to be remembered by him, may not appear before him if not in the form of reflection.
ata evāntaraṃ kiṃciṃddhīsaṃjñaṃ bhavatu sphuṭam | yatrāsya vicchidā bhānaṃ saṃkalpasvapnadarśane | |	Therefore, it is certain that in between the lover and the beloved there must be some intervening factor like the intellect owing to which in the event of separation, the image appears in the form of imagination and dream.
ato nimittaṃ devasya śaktayaḥ santu tādṛśe | itthaṃ viśvamidaṃ nāthe bhairavīyacidambare | pratibimbamalaṃ svacche na khalvanyaprasādataḥ | ananyāpekṣitā yāsya viśvātmatvaṃ prati prabhoḥ | tāṃ parāṃ pratibhā devīṃ saṃgirante hyanuttarām |	In this case, the role of the efficient cause may be played by the forces of the Lord. Thus, this entire world is to be regarded as a taintless reflection of the Lord on the clean canvas of consciousness devoted to Bhairava and hence as due to the grace of none whosoever. The dependence of the Lord on none in this respect is His oneness with the world which is known as His unique and supreme genius.
akulasyāsya devasya kulaprathanaśālinī| kaulikī sā parā śaktiraviyukto yayā prabhuḥ |	The Lord remains always united with His Supreme Force known as Kauliki as it is She who has expanded His family who otherwise is shorn of all familial relationships.
tayoryadyāmalaṃ rūpaṃ sa saṃghaṭṭa iti smṛtaḥ | ānandaśaktiḥ saivoktā yato viśvaṃ visṛjyate | parāparātparaṃ tattvaṃ saiṣā devī nigadyate | tatsāraṃ tacca hṛdayaṃ sa visargaḥ paraḥ prabhuḥ|	This conjugal form of them is known as sanghatta while His Force is known as the Force of Delight on account of whom this world is released. Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu This Devi, divine essence or force, is known as the transcendent as well as the immanent. She is the essence and the heart while that transcendent Lord Śiva is the release of the creation.
devīyāmalaśāstre sā kathitā kālakarṣiṇī | mahāḍāmarake yāge śrīparā mastake tathā |	In the Deviyāmala Tantra, She is known as Kālakarsini, while in the Mahādāmara Tantra, She is named as Sri and Parā at the top of all.
śrī pūrvaśāstre sā mātṛsadbhāvatvena varṇitā | saṃghaṭṭe'smiṃścidātmatvādyattatpratyavamarśanam |	In Purva śāstra she has been accorded the status of the mother. -a In this act of their mixing with one another, sanghatta, contemplation on them as forces of consciousness assumes the form of their supreme controllers as the power of will.
tadā ghorāḥ parā devyo jātāḥ śaivādhvadaiśikāḥ| svātmapratyavamarśo yaḥ prāgabhūdekavīrakaḥ |	As such, being agitated it assumes the role of their controller; then are born the terrible supernal goddesses acting as directresses of the path of Siva.
jñātavyaviśvonmeṣātmā jñānaśaktitayā sthitaḥ | iyaṃ parāparā devī ghorāṃ yā mātṛmaṇḍalīm | sṛjatyavirataṃ śuddhāśuddhamārgaikadīpikām| jñeyāṃśa pronmiṣankṣobhaṃ yadaiti balavattvataḥ |	b-a The self-contemplation which is the beginning became the sole hero, became sustained in the capacity of the power of knowledge on account of unfolding whatever deserves to be known. This is the higher and the lower goddess who create the group of awful mothers continuously treading along the clean and unclean paths serving as a single lamp.
ūnatābhāsanaṃ saṃvinmātratve jāyate tadā | rūḍhaṃ tajjñeyavargasya sthitiprārambha ucyate | |	Unfolding the agitation when the part of what is to be known becomes empowered, then depression becomes set in the consciousness. That state is known as the beginning of that of rigidity in whatever is to be known.
rūḍhireṣā vibodhābdheścitrākāraparigrahaḥ | idaṃ tadbījasaṃdarbhabījaṃ cinvanti yoginaḥ |	This is the context of the seed which yogins pick up.
icchāśaktirdvirūpoktā kṣubhitākṣubhitā ca yā| iṣyamāṇaṃ hi sā vastu dvairūpyeṇātmani śrayet |	b- The Will-power is said to be of two kinds, agitated and unagitated which should accord resort to the desired object in a twofold manner.
aciradyutibhāsinyā śaktyā jvalanarūpayā| iṣyamāṇasamāpattiḥ sthairyeṇātha dharātmanā |	These manners are one in the form of quick illumination like the flame of fire and second as conservation of the desired object steadily like that of the earth.
unmeṣaśaktāvastyetajjñeyaṃ yadyapi bhūyasā | tathāpi vibhavasthānaṃ sā na tu prācyajanmabhūḥ |	Although this is to be understood profoundly in the power of unfoldment even then that is not the ground of the established ground of birth of diversity.
icchāśakterataḥ prāhuścātūrūpyaṃ parāmṛtam| kṣobhāntarasyāsadbhāvānnedaṃ bījaṃ ca kasyacit | |	Icchāśakti this term has four letters involved in its composition. It is of the form of root and is regarded as supernal bliss. Due to lack of agitation in it, it does not act as the seed of anyone.
prakṣobhakatvaṃ bījatvaṃ kṣobhādhāraśca yonitā | kṣobhakaṃ saṃvido rūpaṃ kṣubhyati kṣobhayatyapi | kṣobhaḥ syājjñeyadharmatvaṃ kṣobhaṇā tadbahiṣkṛtiḥ| antaḥsthaviśvābhinnaikabījāṃśavisisṛkṣutā | |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu To cause agitation is the task of consciousness. It gets agitated within itself as well as causes agitation in others. Agitation should be an attribute of knowability while causing agitation, ksobhanā, needs to be taken as instigation to get agitated and be externalised. The whole world lies in a potential form compressed within the Creator like the feather, etc.
kṣobho'tadicche tattvecchā bhāsanaṃ kṣobhaṇāṃ viduḥ | yadaikyāpattimāsādya tadicchā kṛtinī bhavet |	of the peacock in its egg . Each item of that potential content serves as the seed. The agitation within the Creator, though unwilled, is known as ksobhanā which having attained oneness with Him becomes creative.
kṣobhādhāramimaṃ prāhuḥ śrīsomānandaputrakāḥ| saṃvidāmīṣaṇādīnāmanudbhinnaviśeṣakam | |	The disciples of the revered Somānanda have characterised it the basis of creative agitation.
yajjñeyamātraṃ tadbījaṃ yadyogādbījatā svare | tasya bījasya saivoktā visisṛkṣā ya udbhavaḥ| yato grāhyamidaṃ bhāsyadbhinnakalpaṃ cidātmanaḥ |	-a The aspiration of consciousness without manifestation of any specification in it due to having remained only in its cognitive form is known as the seed, bija by virtue of which vowels are known as seeds. b-a The unfoldment of this seed is known as the wish to create the multiplicity on account of which becomes the creation obviously acceptable as separate from the Creator as sheer Consciousness Itself.
eṣa kṣobhaḥ kṣobhaṇā tu tūṣṇīṃbhūtānyamātṛgam | haṭhādyadaudāsīnyāṃśacyāvanaṃ saṃvido balāt | jātāpi visisṛkṣāsau yadvimarśāntaraikyataḥ | kṛtārthā jāyate kṣobhādhāro'traitatprakīrtitam | |	b Sri Tantrāloka This agitation and the consequent act of getting agitated, though remaining silent in other letters, i.e., the consonants, become forced to get rid of their silence by virtue of the consciousness. The wish to unfold the multiplicity from within it with the aid of contemplation and by virtue of getting one with it, becomes fulfilled by turning into the basis of the agitation, as it is called.
tatastadāntaraṃ jñeyaṃ bhinnakalpatvamicchati | viśvabījādataḥ sarvaṃ bāhyaṃ bimbaṃ vivartsyati |	Consequently that inner awareness wishes to unfold itself in the form of the creation as different from the Creator Himself. As a result of this wish the entire external world as the original of the reflection gets expanded from the seed of the consciousness.
kṣobhyakṣobhakabhāvasya satattvaṃ darśitaṃ mayā | śrīmanmaheśvareṇoktaṃ guruṇā yatprasādataḥ |	Thus has been expounded by me the operation of the forces of agitation and agitator as received by me from my revered teacher, the great devotee of Siva.
prakṛtaṃ brūmahe nedaṃ bījaṃ varṇacatuṣṭayam | nāpi yoniryato naitatkṣobhādhāratvamṛcchati |	Let us come to the main topic. These four letters, ie, r, , Ir and If are neither seed nor the female organ of procreation, bhaga, the basis of reproduction.
ātmanyeva ca viśrāntyā tatproktamamṛtātmakam | itthaṃ prāguditaṃ yattatpañcakaṃ tatparasparam | ucchaladvividhākāramanyonyavyatimiśraṇāt| yo'nuttaraḥ paraḥ spando yaścānandaḥ samucchalan |	They are self-contented and hence are characterised as immortal. -a Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Thus, the five letters, which have already been referred to, by getting coalesced with one another get transformed into various forms. Such as a + a = ā; a + i = ai; a + u = o; a + r = ar; a + o = au; i + u = y; u + a = v.
tāvicchonmeṣasaṃghaṭṭād gacchato'tivicitratām| anuttarānandacitī icchāśaktau niyojite |	Due to interaction of desire and unfoldment they have assumed peculiar forms. However, delight and consciousness uniquely remain constant in the force of the desire.
= trikoṇamiti tatprāhurvisargāmodasundaram| anuttarānandaśaktī tatra rūḍhimupāgate | |	b- The triangular e ए is said to be beautified by the delight of manifestation as its three angles stand for desire, knowledge and action.
trikoṇadvitvayogena vrajataḥ ṣaḍarasthitim | ta evonmeṣayoge'pi punastanmayatāṃ gate |	The two triangles combined with each other assume the shape of a hexagon. On the point of unfoldment these angles also become identical with the Creation i.e., Saḍānana.
ta eva śaktī tādrūpyabhāginyau nānyathāsthite | nanvanuttaratānandau svātmanā bhedavarjitau | |	The agitations arising in desire and unfoldment and within their products also assume the same form and are not separate from them anyway. What has nothing higher than itself as also the delight have no varieties of themselves.
kathametāvatīmenāṃ vaicitrīṃ svātmani śritau | śṛṇu tāvadayaṃ saṃvinnatho'parimitātmakaḥ |	As such, how is it that both of them have assumed so peculiar forms within themselves? Now listen. The Lord of consciousness is infinite.
anantaśaktivaicitryalayodayakaleśvaraḥ |	His is the abode of endless forces in Himself both in regard to their emanation as well as merger.
asthāsyedekarūpeṇa vapuṣā cenmaheśvaraḥ | maheśvaratvaṃ saṃvittvaṃ tadatyakṣyaddhaṭādivat | paricchinnaprakāśatvaṃ jaḍasya kila lakṣaṇam |	The whole has emerged out of the operation of His forces and He, the Maheśvara is their Lord. -a If the Great Lord were to remain in a singular form, He ought to have relinquished His consciousness as well as Lordship as pitcher, etc., as limitation of illumination is the obvious feature of the inconscient.
jaḍādvilakṣaṇo bodho yato na parimīyate | tena bodhamahāsindhorullāsinyaḥ svaśaktayaḥ |	Distinct from the nature of the inconscient is the nature of consciousness and hence it abides in unlimited consciousness.
āśrayantyūrmaya iva svātmasaṃghaṭṭacitratām svātmasaṃghaṭṭavaicitryaṃ śaktīnāṃ yatparasparam |	As such, the mighty forces of the great sea of consciousness take resort to Him as waves of mutual interaction. This mutual interaction of the forces is said to be the manifest form of His force of action.
etadeva paraṃ prāhuḥkriyāśakteḥ sphuṭaṃ vapuḥ | asmiṃścaturdaśe dhāmni sphuṭībhūtatriśaktike | triśūlatvamataḥ prāha śāstā śrīpūrvaśāsane | nirañjanamidaṃ coktaṃ gurubhistattvadarśibhiḥ |	In this fourteen-fold abode of Him in which are being manifest His three forces, lies the significance of His trident as has been spelled out by the writer of the previous scripture, i.c. Mālinivijayottara Tantra. b-a Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu The enlightened teachers have characterised this world as blemishless on account of the fact that blemishes affect the forceful and by no means the force itself.
śaktimānañjyate yasmānna śaktirjātu kenacit| icchā jñānaṃ kriyā ceti yatpṛthakpṛthagañjyate |	Desire, knowledge and action may affect their possessors if cherished separately. In the case of their taking resort to one and the same person together, they eliminate the adverse effects of one another by themselves.
tadeva śaktimatsvaiḥ svairiṣyamāṇādikaiḥ sphuṭam| etattritayamaikyena yadā tu prasphurettadā |	a- Thus, as these three forces are obstructive of the adverse effect of one another in Siva, the yogin's absorption of himself in Him makes him quickly spotless.
itthaṃ parāmṛtapadādārabhyāṣṭakamīdṛśam| brāhmayādirūpasaṃbhedādyātyaṣṭāṣṭakatāṃ sphuṭam | atrānuttaraśaktiḥ sā svaṃ vapuḥ prakaṭasthitam | kurvantyapi jñeyakalākāluṣyāvindurūpiṇī |	Thus, beginning from the initial six r,r, Ir, lr, e, ai letters with addition of o and au with them these eight letters being multiplied by the number of goddesses associated with them which, too, are eight, the number reaches to sixty-four which is the result of variation due to externalisation. Herewith the unique force manifests its body and makes it obvious in spite of retaining its form as the point.
uditāyāṃ kriyāśaktau somasūryāgnidhāmani | avibhāgaḥ prakāśo yaḥ sa binduḥ paramo hi naḥ |	The point . remains the undivided light and the supreme for us in spite of the rising from within it the moon, the sun and the fire by virtue of the power of action since it is Śiva Himself.
tattvarakṣāvidhāne ca taduktaṃ parameśinā | hṛtpadmaṇḍalāntaḥstho naraśaktiśivātmakaḥ |	It has been stated by Lord Śiva Himself in Tattva Raksā Vidhāna that the power of the human individual is pervaded by Śiva in the lotuses of the heart, the middle of the eye-brows, and the brain.
boddhavyo layabhedena bindurvimalatārakaḥ | yo'sau nādātmakaḥ śabdaḥ sarvaprāṇiṣvavasthitaḥ | | adha ūrdhvavibhāgena niṣkriyeṇāvatiṣṭhate | hlādataikṣṇyādivaicitryaṃ sitaraktādikaṃ ca yat |	Through the breakage of the sound on these locations needs to be understood the start of the point which, indeed, is lying there within all living beings in the verbal form. That verbal sound subsists within all inactive having divided itself into the below apāna and the up prāna. The teacher has said that the light is shorn of peculiar attributes like pleasantness, bitterness, whiteness, redness, etc.
svayaṃ tannirapekṣo'sau prakāśo gururāha ca | yanna sūryo na vā somo nāgnirbhāsayate'pi ca |	and is self-illumined. Neither the sun nor the moon nor even fire illuminates it. On the contrary the luminosity of the sun, the moon and the fire would do nothing in the absence of that Light.
svasvātantryaprabhāvodyadvicitropādhisaṃgataḥ| prakāśo yāti taikṣṇyādimavāntaravicitratām |	It is the light of one's own inner being, which, indeed, is the illumination of consciousness. - Being hidden by the peculiar superimposition born of the autonomy of the Lord it attains the peculiarity of bitterness, etc.
durdarśano'pi dharmāṃśuḥ patitaḥ pāthasāṃ pathi| netrānandatvamabhyeti paśyopādheḥ prabhāvitām | |	in the form of the sun, etc. Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu The ray of the sun, difficult to bear with otherwise, when looked at via water, becomes pleasing to the eye. Look to the effect of the superimposition ! The light of the sun, etc., has been defiled by the superimposition.
sūryādiṣu prakāśo'sāvupādhikaluṣīkṛtaḥ | saṃvitprakāśaṃ māheśamata eva hyapekṣate |	The sun is obviously the fully manifest light while the moon brings down the light carrying with it the essence of the objects which are to be illumined.
sūryaṃ pramāṇamityāhuḥ somaḥ meyaṃ pracakṣate |	The sun is the measure of testing the validity while the moon is the object of the test.
anyonyamaviyuktau tau svatantrāvapyubhau sthitau |	Both these are interrelated with each other and yet are independent of each other.
bhoktṛbhogyobhayātmaitadanyonyonmukhatāṃ gatam | tato jvalanacidrūpaṃ citrabhānuḥ prakīrtitaḥ |	-a Therefore fire is like the consciousness. On account of the variety of its light, it is described as citrabhānu, possessed of various kinds of light.
yo'yaṃ vahneḥ paraṃ tattvaṃ pramāturidameva tat | saṃvideva tu vijñeyatādātmyādanapekṣiṇī |	The supreme essence of fire is the same as that of the knower. b-a Consciousness, on the other hand, owing to its nature of becoming identified with the object, does not depend on anything else.
svatantratvātpramātoktā vicitro jñeyabhedataḥ | somāṃśadāhyavastūtthavaicitryābhābṛṃhitaḥ | tata evāgniruditaścitrabhānurmaheśinā| jñeyādyupāyasaṃghātanirapekṣaiva saṃvidaḥ | |	Owing to its autonomy, it is characterised as the knower particularly as different from the object. b- a Fire manifests itself in various colours due to the object it burns and hence has been described by the Great Lord as citrabhānu, possessed of various kinds of light.
sthitirmātāhamasmīti jñātā śāstrajñavadyataḥ| ajña eva yato jñātānubhavātmā na rūpataḥ |	b-a The status of consciousness is different from the coordinate complex of the object and the means of knowledge, 'I am the knower' enjoying the position akin to that of the knower of the scriptures.
na tu sā jñātṛtā yasyāṃ śuddhajñeyādyapekṣate| tasyāṃ daśāyāṃ jñātṛtvamucyate yogyatāvaśāt |	b-a The knower is ignorant as he does not share the experience of the real Knower. There does not lie any knowledgeability where it stands in need of having anything to be known.
mānataiva tu sā prācyapramātṛparikalpitā | ucchalantyapi saṃvittiḥ kālakramavivarjanāt |	b-a Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu In spite of manifesting itself as knower, known and knowledge, consciousness is not bound by the process of time and hence remains constantly awake in its full form.
pākādistu kriyā kālaparicchedātkramocitā |	b-a The act of cooking, etc. is bound by the process of time.
matāntyakṣaṇavandhyāpi na pākatvaṃ prapadyate | itthaṃ prakāśatattvasya somasūryāgnitā sthitā | |	Following the last moment of cooking it has to stop from the act. b-a Thus gets established the luminosity of luminaries in the form of the sun, the moon and fire.
api mukhyaṃ tatprakāśamātratvaṃ na vyapohyate | eṣāṃ yatprathamaṃ rūpa hrasvaṃ tatsūrya ucyate | |	They as such, may appear and disappear but the essential luminosity which is the main object of contention here does not disappear altogether.
kṣobhānandavaśāddīrghaviśrāntyā soma ucyate| yattatparaṃ plutaṃ nāma somānandātparaṃ sthitam | prakāśarūpaṃ tatprāhurāgneyaṃ śāstrakovidāḥ| atra prakāśamātraṃ yatsthite dhāmatraye sati |	b-a Out of these the first short form is said to be solar while due to inherence of agitation and delight in it the second one involving a longer pause is characterised as lunar and knowers of scriptures have called the luminous one, the lengthened as in that of fire. b-a Fire is sheer illumination in all the three worlds.
uktaṃ bindutayā śāstre śivavindurasau mataḥ | makārādanya evāyaṃ tacchāyāmātradhṛdyathā |	It is said in the scripture as the point bindu. It is rather the point representative of Śiva.
ralahāḥ ṣaṇṭhavaisargavarṇarūpatvasaṃsthitāḥ | ikāra eva rephāṃśacchāyayānyo yathā svaraḥ |	b-a Bindu is different from the letter m which is only its shadow, r, land h are shadows of r, !, and visarga : remaining in the list as the sixth letter. b- a The vowel i is a shadow of the consonantr the role of a vowel.
tathaiva mahaleśādaḥ so'nyo dvedhāsvaro'pi san| asyāntarvisisṛkṣāsau yā proktā kaulikī parā |	In the same way a assumes the form of aḥ and thus becomes bindu . as well as visarga :. b- a The power of creativity latent inside a is known as the higher form of the kundalinī.
saiva kṣobhavaśādeti visargaitmikatāṃ dhruvam | uktaṃ ca triśiraḥ śāstre kalāvyāptyantacarcane | | kalā saptadaśī tasmādamṛtākārarūpiṇī | parāparasvasvarūpabindugatyā visarpitā |	b-a In the Trisira śāstra it has been said in the context of manifestation of kalā that a is the seventeenth form of kalā, fraction, and therefore of the form of immortality. It has spread out in the form of point . everywhere indicating its Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu transcendent and immanent forms by the placement of the points one above and the other below to it :.
prakāśyaṃ sarvavastūnāṃ visargarahitā tu sā | śaktikuṇḍalikā caiva prāṇakuṇḍalikā tathā |	It illuminates all things in the form of the knower, object of knowledge and the process of knowing itself in its potential form. It is also characterised as the sakti kundalikā as well as the prāna-kundalikā.
visargaprāntadeśe tu parā kuṇḍalinīti ca | śivavyometi paramaṃ brahmātmasthānamucyate | visargamānaṃ nāthasya sṛṣṭisaṃhāravibhramāḥ | svātmanaḥ svātmani svātmakṣepo vaisargikī sthitiḥ | |	In the state beyond that of manifestation, it is known as the parā-kundalini, transcendent kundalini its location being in Supreme Brahman or Śiva Vyoman, creation and withdrawal of the world being illusory, the sheer will of the Lord to expand Himself out of Himself well within Himself.
visarga evamutsṛṣṭa āśyānatvamupāgataḥ | haṃsaḥ prāṇo vyaṃñjanaṃ ca sparśaṃśca paribhāṣyate |	b- It is sheer emission which being released and getting expanded becomes hamsa and prāna and is pronounced as a consonant as it is produced by the contact in the vocal organ.
anuttaraṃ paraṃ dhāma tadevākulamucyate | visargastasya nāthasya kaulikī śaktirucyate |	It is symbolic of the highest abode of the Lord and is characterised as akula, unfamilial, while the emission of the world is ascribed to the kauliki Force of Him.
visargatā ca saivāsyā yadānandoyakramāt | spaṣṭībhūtakriyāśaktiparyantā procchalatsthitiḥ |	The emitting of the will of the Supernal Force lies in the fact that she goes on making herself manifest until her delight permits her to go on acting up to the end. The task of emission goes on revealing itself so much as does the vibration of the ocean in the infinitude of the waves.
ata eva visargo'yamavyaktahakalātmakaḥ | kāmatatvamitiśrīmatkulaguhvara ucyate |	This emission is a part of the sound ha and, therefore, it has been characterised in Kulaguhvara as kāma, sheer desire.
yattadakṣaramavyaktaṃ kāntākaṇṭhe vyavasthitam | dhvanirūpamanicchaṃ tu dhyānadhāraṇavarjitam |	It is that inaudible immortal sound which lies implicit in the throat of the beloved, in the form of sound, desireless and bereft of the act of meditation and sustenance.
tatra cittaṃ samādhāya vaśayedyugapajjagat | ata eva visargasya haṃse yadvatsphuṭā sthitiḥ |	Having concentrated one's citta on that sound, one may exercise control on the entire universe.
tadvatsānuttarādīnāṃ kādisāntatayā sthitiḥ | anuttarātkavargasya sūtiḥ pañcātmanaḥ sphuṭam | pañcaśaktyātmatāveśa ekaikatra yathā sphuṭaḥ | icchāśakteḥ svasvarūpasaṃsthāyā ekarūpataḥ | cavargaḥ pañcaśaktyātmā kramaprasphuṭatātmakaḥ | yā tūktā jñeyakāluṣya bhākkṣiprasthirayogataḥ |	This is why as the act of emission is explicit in the sound h of the word hamsa, even so all the sounds from k to s of the devanāgari alphabet along with the vowels lie latent in the emission. -a As the K group of sounds get born of the anuttarā, even so oneness with the five forces becomes explicit. b-a Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu From the integral and essential form of the will as represented by the sound i is born the group of the sound c, it, too, consisting of five letter manifesting themselves from their points of articulation in the same order.
dvirūpāyāstato jātaṃ ṭatādyaṃ vargayugmakam | unmeṣātpādivargastu yato viśvaṃ samāpyate |	The process of contamination works in a twofold manner, quick and constant. The quick contamination results in the group of t sound while the constant one working on! results in the t-sound group.
jñeyarūpamidaṃ pañcaviṃśatyantaṃ yataḥ sphuṭam| jñeyatvātsphuṭataḥ proktametāvatsparśarūpakam |	b- This group of twenty-five sounds is extremely obvious. On account of its obviousness as also cognisance, these twenty-five sounds have been accorded the imagery of contact letters.
icchāśaktiśca yā dvedhā kṣabhitākṣubhitatvataḥ | sā vijātīyaśaktyaṃśapronmukhī yāti yātmatām | saiva śīghrataropāttajñeyakāluṣyarūṣitā | vijātīyonmukhatvena ratvaṃ latvaṃ ca gacchati | | yadvadunmeṣaśaktirdvirūpā vaijātyaśaktigā| vakāratvaṃ prapadyeta sṛṣṭisārapravarṣakam |	The will-power in its two agitated and unagitated forms when getting inclined to form a series different from its own, assumes the form of the sound y. The same sound being contaminated quickly by its object and on account of its inclination to become different from itself assumes the form of sounds r and l. Exactly as it did earlier in the transformation of y into r and l, the same power of manifestation willing to assume a different form of its dual action results in the outcome of the sound v which being a representative of god Varuna rains down the essence of the creation.
icchaivānuttarānandayātā śīghratvayogataḥ| vāyurityucyate vahnirbhāsinātsthairyato dharā |	It is the will itself which being quickened in its action assumes the form of vāyu, air and of vahini, fire, on account of its luminosity and of dharā, the earth, on account of its stability.
idaṃ catuṣkamantaḥ sthamata eva nigadyate | icchādyantargatatvena svasamāptau ca saṃsthiteḥ |	These four y, r, land v sounds are known as antahstha, staying within, on account of their entry within desire and unfoldment and stability there following their action.
sajātīyakaśaktīnāmicchādyānāṃ ca yojanam | kṣobhātmakamidaṃ prāhuḥ kṣobhākṣobhātmanāmapi |	When vowels of the same kind coalesce with each other, they result in the outcome of the lengthened one irrespective of the fact whether they are long or short. Examples are i + i = i, i + = , i + i = i.
anuttarasya sājātye bhavettu dvitayī gatiḥ | anuttaraṃ yattatraikaṃ taccedānandasūtaye | | prabhaviṣyati tadyoge yogaḥ kṣobhātmakaḥ sphuṭaḥ| atrāpyanuttaraṃ dhāma dvitīyamapi sūtaye |	When the letter a coalesces with the same a, it results the second position. In one Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu case, it becomes lengthened and produces delight. Example is danda + agram = dandāgram. In the other one, it remains the same ā particularly when followed by the same guna vowel.
na paryāptaṃ tadā kṣobhaṃ vinaivānuttarātmatā | icchā yā karmaṇā hīnā yā caiṣṭavyena rūṣitā |	- In this case, the agitation does not prove sufficient to lengthen the vowel a. Desire bereft of action remains stunted by the desired.
śīghrasthairyaprabhinnena tridhā bhāvamupāgatā | anunmiṣitamunmīlatpronmīlitamiti sthitam | |	Quick dispersal from the stasis results in a threefold result, namely, unmanifest, manifest and fully manifest. The desired object in this case takes a threefold conversion without any movement away from its original status.
iṣyamāṇaṃ tridhaitasyāṃ tādrūpyasyāparicyuteḥ | tadeva svoṣmaṇā svātmasvātantrya preraṇātmanā |	That conversion takes place owing to addition of vehemence and instigation for exercise of autonomy of oneself. The sound s coming to the verge of manifestation assumes three forms as s, s, and s.
bahirbhāvya sphuṭaṃ kṣiptaṃ śa ṣa satritayaṃ sthitam | tata eva sakāre'sminsphuṭaṃ viśvaṃ prakāśate | amṛtaṃ ca paraṃ dhāma yoginastatpracakṣate | kṣobhādyantavirāmeṣu tadeva ca parāmṛtam |	This is why the statement goes that in the sounds the entire universe is shining clearly. Yogins characterise it as the highest abode of immortality. On coming to the point of rest following the end as well as preceding the beginning the agitation becomes the highest state of immortality.
sītkārasukhasadbhāvasamāveśasamādhiṣu | tadeva brahma paramamavibhaktaṃ pracakṣate |	Coming as the initial sound in the delightful words sī, sukha, sadbhāva, samāvesa and samādhi it amounts to refer to the state of Brahman in its full sense.
uvāca bhagavāneva tacchrīmatkulaguhvare | śaktiśaktimadaikātmyalabdhānvarthābhidhāna | kākacañcupuṭākāraṃ dhyānadhāraṇavarjitam| viṣatattvamanackākhyaṃ tava snehātprakāśitam |	Lord Śiva Himself has explained it in the text known as Kulaguhvara, in which the unity of the Force and the Forceful has been actualised. O Lady, I have explained this in that text out of my love towards you how that supernal state is firm like the closed beak of a crow, bereft of meditation as well as sustenance in that state, which is all-pervading and shorn of discontinuity.
kāmasya pūrṇatā tattvaṃ saṃghaṭṭa pravibhāvyate | viṣasya cāmṛtaṃ tattvaṃ chādyatve'ṇoścyute sati |	I have explained how in the interaction between the lover and the beloved in the act of sex there becomes manifest desire in fullness particularly when the pervasive ambrosia of the individual falls from its position.
vyāptrīśaktirviṣaṃ yasmādavyāptuśchādayenmahaḥ | nirañjanaṃ paraṃ dhāma tattvaṃ tasya tu sāñjanam |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Pervasive is the Force so as to conceal the power of illumination of the individual which is blemishless, a fraction of the highest abode and is intended for the manifestation of the world out of it.
kriyāśaktyātmakaṃ viśvamayaṃ tasmātsphuredyataḥ | icchā kāmo viṣaṃ jñānaṃ kriyā devī nirañjanam |	It embodies within it desire, will, pervasiveness, knowledge and action in an unblemished form. Assimilation of will, knowledge and action is said to be characteristic of Siva, Bhairava, the tremendous.
etattrayasamāveśaḥ śivo bhairava ucyate | atra rūḍhiṃ sadā kuryāditi no guravo jaguḥ |	One should try to reach that state, our teachers have instructed us so.
viṣatattve saṃpraviśya na bhūtaṃ na viṣaṃ na ca | grahaḥ kevala evāhamiti bhāvanayā sphuret |	- Following the entry into this pervasive state there does not remain any trace of the past, the present nor even of attachment with the world and instead of these only the sense of one's own pure being becomes manifest.
nanvatra ṣaṇṭhavarṇebhyo janmoktaṃ tena ṣaṇṭhatā| kathaṃ syāditi cedbramo nātra ṣaṇṭhasya sotṛtā | |	It is out of the primary vowels numbering six that all the letters are born. How does it happen like this ? Being neutral, these vowels in themselves do not produce anything.
tathāhi tatragā yāsāvicchāśaktirudīritā | saiva sūte svakartavyamantaḥsthaṃ sveṣṭarūpakam |	It is, indeed, the will-power implicit in these letters which gives rise to these letters as willed by her. Since there is sufficient cause of getting motivated inside the usma sounds that they get agitated and become productive.
jñeyārūṣaṇayā yuktaṃ samudāyātmakaṃ viduḥ | ṣaṇṭhaṃ kṣobhakatākṣobhadhāmatvābhāvayogataḥ|	It is out of a combination of the impression of the object of knowledge and the will to know that ūsma sounds get agitated and begin to serve as the source o agitation.
etadvarṇacatuṣkasya svoṣmaṇābhāsanāvaśāt| ūṣmeti kathitaṃ nāma bhairaveṇāmalātmanā |	The group of four antahstha letters are known as usma on account of heat being manifest in their pronunciation. These letters have been characterised as usma by Bhairava, the spotlessly pure.
kādihāntamidaṃ prāhuḥ kṣobhādhāratayā budhāḥ | yonirūpeṇa tasyāpi yoge kṣobhāntaraṃ vrajet | |	The letters beginning from k and ending with h are said by wise people as sustainers of agitation. Being associated with them as womb, one has the likelihood of undergoing another agitation.
tannidarśanayogena pañcāśattamavarṇatā| pañcaviṃśakasaṃjñeyaprāgvadbhūmisusaṃsthitam | |	It is due to association of the initial and the ending sound of this list, i.e., k + s, that is formed the fiftieth sound ks क्ष of it.
catuṣkaṃ ca catuṣkaṃ ca bhedābhedagataṃ kramāt | ādyaṃ catuṣkaṃ saṃvitterbhedasaṃdhānakovidam |	- The group of four antahstha letters, i.e., y, r, land v in combination with four usma sounds such as s, s, s and h are denotative respectively of difference and non-difference.
bhedasyābhedarūḍhyekaheturanyac catuṣṭayam | itthaṃ yadvarṇajātaṃ tatsarvaṃ svaramayaṃ purā | |	Thus, all these sounds get primarily combined with vowels.
vyaktiyogādvyañjanaṃ tatsvaraprāṇaṃ yataḥ kila | svarāṇāṃ ṣaṭkameveha mūlaṃ syādvarṇasaṃtatau |	Since they make the sound manifest, they Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu are known as vyanjana, the breath in them, however, is the vowel itself. In this string of sounds, the vowels involved are basically only six, i.e., a, ā, i, i, u, ø.
ṣaḍadevatāstu tā eva ye mukhyāḥ sūryaraśmayaḥ | saurāṇāmeva raśmīnāmantaścāndrakalā yataḥ | | ato'tra dīrghatritayaṃ sphuṭaṃ cāndramasaṃ vapuḥ | candraśca nāma naivānyo bhogyaṃ bhoktuśca nāparam | |	The group of six divinities presiding over these vowels are the same as are those presiding over the solar rays, namely, Dahani, Pacani, Dhūmrā, Karsini, Varsini and Rasā . Since the divisions of the moon are implicit well within the rays of the sun, therefore, the three basic vowels being lengthened form expressly the body of the moon. The moon is none else but the object of enjoyment of the sun.
bhoktaiva bhogyabhāvena dvaividhyātsaṃvyavasthitaḥ | ghaṭasya na hi bhogyatvaṃ svaṃ vapurmātṛgaṃ hi tat | ato mātari yā rūḍhiḥ sāsya bhogyatvamucyate | anuttaraṃ parāmṛśyaparāmarśakabhāvataḥ | |	Thus the enjoyer itself has put itself here in a dual form. A pitcher is by no means an object of its own enjoyment but of the enjoyer of it. It is the idea of its user himself which serves as its enjoyer. -a It is the supernal sound a which having assumed the dual role of the contemplator and object of contemplation performs the act of contact while the power of will, etc.
saṃghaṭṭarūpatāṃ prāptaṃ bhogyamicchādikaṃ tathā | anuttarānandabhuvāmicchādye bhogyatāṃ gate |	serve as its object of enjoyment. b-a The supernal sound a when getting combined with i andu become indicative of enjoyment and thus are produced the combined sounds like e ए and o ओ which are indicative of the enjoyer.
saṃdhyakṣarāṇāmudayo bhoktṛrūpaṃ ca kathyate | anuttarānandamayo devo bhoktaiva kathyate |	b-a The Deity of the supernal sound a is said to be only the enjoyer while i, etc.
icchādikaṃ bhogyameva tata evāsya śaktitā | bhogyaṃ bhoktari līnaṃ ced bhoktā tadvastutaḥ sphuṭaḥ|	are only the object of enjoyment and therein lies their potentiality. b-a When the object of enjoyment gets assimilated to the enjoyer, obviously only the enjoyer remains there.
ataḥ ṣaṇṇāṃ trikaṃ sāraṃ cidiṣyunmeṣaṇātmakam| tadeva tritayaṃ prāhurbhairavasya paraṃ mahaḥ |	Therefore, out of the six basic vowels only the three short ones remain as essential. b-a That group of three short vowels, i.e., a, i, and u represent the highest illumination of Bhairava. Therefore, this triad of basic vowels is characterised as the complete force of the Supernal Lord.
tattrikaṃ parameśasya pūrṇā śakti pragīyate | tenākṣiptaṃ yato viśvamato'ṣminsamupāsite |	b-a It is from within this triad that the entire creation has been thrown out. The aspirant needs to worship the Supreme Unbounded Force in the form of this triad.
viśvaśaktāvacchedavandhye jātamupāsanam| ityeṣa mahimaitāvāniti tāvanna śakyate | aparicchinnaśakteḥ kaḥ kuryācchaktiparicchidām| tasmādanuttaro devaḥ svācchandyānuttaratvataḥ | |	b-a This much is the greatness of the Lord. One cannot imagine as to how much it is. Who can imagine the extent of the Force of the unbounded ? b-a Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu This is why that Transcendent Lord on account of His autonomy and excellence as also by virtue of being associated with His power of expansion that He has assumed the form of the whole of the universe.
visargaśaktiyuktatvātsaṃpanno viśvarūpakaḥ | evaṃ pañcāśadāmarśapūrṇaśaktirmaheśvaraḥ | |	b-a Thus being equipped with fifty powers of forbearance the great Lord remains in His single self-contemplation forming the abode of several other forces.
vimarśātmaika evānyā śaktayo'traiva niṣṭhitāḥ| ekāśītipadā devī hyatrāntarbhāvayiṣyate |	b- a Thus, the goddess of mātrkās really of eighty-one letters becomes accommodated within fifty ones. b NOTE: Eighty-one letters of alphabet are as follows: . Consonant from ka क to ksa क्ष .

It is conceived in nine rows as done earlier on account of separate places of articulation of the letters. On account of calculation of the points of articulation in the vocal organ as also emphasis involved in the same process of articulation, the numbers of the letters become fifty.
śivo mātāpitṛtvena kartā viśvatra saṃsthitaḥ | visarga eva śākto'yaṃ śivabindutayā punaḥ | garbhīkṛtānantaviśvaḥ śrayate'nuttarātmatām | aparicchinnaviśvāntaḥ sāre svātmani yaḥ prabhoḥ |	-a Thus, on account of His contemplative involvement in the form of sound, Siva indwells the world as its mother and father both together hence as its creator. b-a This expansion is, indeed, the work of the Creative Force wherein Siva is operative as the point. Serving on the one hand as the womb of the creation in its infinity He maintains His transcendence at the same time.
parāmarśaḥ sa evokto dvayasaṃpattilakṣaṇaḥ | anuttaravisargātmaśivaśaktyadvayātmani |	b-a The subsistence of the Lord in His unlimited essence in the boundless universe is His parāmarśa, contemplation, involving in it His playing the dual role as the seed as well as the womb.

anuttarādyā prasṛtirhāntā śaktisvarūpiṇī |	b-a Creation extents from the transcendent symbolised by the letter a and ends with h and is a transformed state of the Force.
pratyāhṛtāśeṣaviśvānuttare sā nilīyate | tadidaṃ viśvamantaḥ sthaṃ śaktau sānuttare pare |	Therefore, having withdrawn it from the state of entire expansion it ultimately compresses itself again in the same transcendent a.
tattasyāmiti yatsatyaṃ vibhunā saṃpuṭīkṛtiḥ | tena śrītrīśikāśāstre śakteḥ saṃpuṭitākṛtiḥ |	b-a Therefore, it has been maintained as such by the Trisika Tantra.
saṃvittau bhāti yadviśvaṃ tatrāpi khalu saṃvidā | tadetattritayaṃ dvandvayogātsaṃghātatāṃ gatam |	b The world as consciousness, flourishes in consciousness and by virtue of consciousness. All these three roles of consciousness have come to be unified by the force of duality.
ekameva paraṃ rūpaṃ bhairavasyāhamātmakam| visargaśaktiryā śaṃbhoḥ setthaṃ sarvatra vartate |	Only one essence of the transcendent Bhairava manifesting in the form of ‘I’ operates everywhere by virtue of the Force of Expansion.

pūrvaṃ visṛjyasakalaṃ kartavyaṃ śūnyatānale | cittaviśrāntisaṃjño'yamāṇavastadanantaram |	b- First of all, one needs to dismiss all the content of the inner being as if all one's possessions were to be burnt in fire.
dṛṣṭaśrutāditadvastupronmukhatvaṃ svasaṃvidi| cittasaṃbodhanāmoktaḥ śāktollāsabharātmakaḥ | tatronmukhatvatadvastusaṃghaṭṭādvastuno hṛdi | rūḍheḥ pūrṇatayāveśānmitacittalayācchive |	This state of the inner being citta is known as citta-viśrānti, resting of the atomic self within itself. This state needs to be followed by another state known as citta-sambodha, awakening of inner being. Under this state whatever has been seen and heard of, etc., needs to be surrendered inwardly to the delight of the Force of Siva.
prāgvadbhaviṣyadaunmukhyasaṃbhāvyamitatālayāt cittapralayanāmāsau visarga śāmbhavaḥ paraḥ | | tattvarakṣāvidhāne'to visargatraidhamucyate | hṛtpadmakośamadhyasthastayoḥ saṃghaṭṭa iṣyate | |	As a result of the surrender of all to śiva and the consequent contact with the bare inner being, followed by complete absorption in Siva, the inner being gets restored to its primeval state resulting in the elimination of its confinements known as the state of visarga, liberation, relating to the state of the transcendent Śiva.
visargo'ntaḥ sa ca proktaścittaviśrāntilakṣaṇaḥ| dvitīyaḥ sa visargastu cittasaṃbodhalakṣaṇaḥ | |	First one of the liberations is stoppage of that contact inside the heart.

Whatever distinction between the object and the subject remains here, all that distinction integrally is considered as owing purely to the device of Śiva. When the distinction between the subject and the object gets completely integrated into one act of reception, citta becomes completely eliminated.
tṛtīyaḥ sa visargastu cittapralayalakṣaṇaḥ | ekībhāvātmakaḥ sūkṣmo vijñānātmātmanirvṛtaḥ |	This integrated state of oneness is extremely subtle where the Self becomes absorbed completely into itself. This is the third kind of liberation known as visarga.

kakārādisakārāntā visargātpañcadhā sa ca | bahiścāntaśca hṛdaye nāde'tha parame pade |	Heart is the locus of the highest status. Besides heart four other locations of this category are throat, middle of the eyebrows, end of the force and the top of the head.
bindurātmani mūrdhānta hṛdayādvyāpako hi saḥ| ādimāntyavihīnāstu mantrāḥ syuḥ śaradabhravat |	Mantras lacking in involvement of their initial a and last consonant h in all the mysteriousness are supposed to be ineffective like the cloud of the autumn season.
gurorlakṣaṇametāvadādimāntyaṃ ca vedayet| pūjya so'hamiva jñānī bhairavo devatātmakaḥ |	b- The characteristic quality of a teacher is that he needs to make the disciple understand both the beginning a and the ending h, by virtue of making him know these he becomes revered like myself, indeed, as tremendous Bhairava as a divine being.
ślokagāthādi yatkiṃcidādimāntyayutaṃ tataḥ | tasmādvidaṃstathā sarvaṃ mantratvenaiva paśyati | |	Whatever sloka or mantra be, it comes within the fold of the initial a and the ending h. He who knows this, regards all such compositions as mantras.
visargaśaktirviśvasya kāraṇaṃ ca nirūpitā| aitareyākhyavedānte parameśena vistarāt |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu It is the power of manifestation of the Supreme Lord which is the cause of creation of the world.

bījayonisamāpattivisargodayasundarā| mālinī hi parā śaktirnirṇītā viśvarūpiṇī | |	On account of serving as the motivating force behind the contact between the seed and the womb and cause of the emission of the creative stuff, mālini is considered as supreme creative force responsible for assumption of the form of the universe.
eṣā vastuta ekaiva parā kālasya karṣiṇī| śaktimadbhedayogena yāmalatvaṃ prapadyate |	She is only one transcendent force imparting her motivation to Time to move on. On account of the distinction between the force and the Lord of the force, she has assumed the conjugal form.
tasya pratyavamarśo yaḥ paripūrṇo'hamātmakaḥ | sa svātmani svatantratvādvibhāgamavabhāsayet | |	The counter-contemplation of the conjugal form of the Lord of this force in the form of I am complete within myself appears as divisive on account of His autonomy.
vibhāgābhāsane cāsya tridhā vapurudāhṛtam | paśyantī madhyamā sthūlā baikharītyabhiśabditam | tāsāmapi tridhā rūpaṃ sthūlasūkṣmaparatvataḥ | tatra yā svarasandarbhasubhagā nādarūpiṇī |	Following the appearance of the division, His body is viewed as paśyanti, madhyamā and vaikharī. Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Of these forms of sound also there is a threefold division termed as tangible, subtle and transcendent. From amidst this division also, that section is termed as paśyanti which is sonorous and musical hence beautiful owing to distinctness of syllables, etc.
sthānavāyvādigharṣotthā sphuṭataiva ca pāruṣī| tadasyāṃ nādarūpāyāṃ saṃvitsavidhavṛttitaḥ | |	-a The uniformity of the unity of sound is the quality of sweetness while the clarity born of the locus of utterance and contact of the organs and air imparts it roughness.

sa sphuṭāsphuṭarūpatvānmadhyamā sthūlarūpiṇī | madhyāyāścāvibhāgāṃśasadbhāva iti raktatā |	b-a The sound produced by the drum through the membrane of a musical instrument is partly clear and partly vague, similar is the tangibility of the state of madhyamā vāk.
avibhāgasvaramayī yatra syāttatsurañjakam | avibhāgo hi nirvṛtyai dṛśyatāṃ tālapāṭhataḥ |	Indeed, wherever there is any element of obscurity, there is fascination. b- a Absence of division results in the sense of liberation in the viewers of tāla-pātha, rhythmic sound of a drum from low bass to high pitch.
kilāvyaktadhvanau tasminvādane parituṣyati | yā tu sphuṭānāṃ varṇānāmutpattau kāraṇaṃ bhavet |	This is why the audience becomes satisfied with this kind of musical performance. b-a Vaikhari on account of its tangibility might have created distinction of letters.

It is out of absorption in these three states that is born the power of action.
saṃvido dvādaśa proktā yāsu sarvaṃ samāpyate | etāvadevadevasya mukhyaṃ tacchakticakrakam | |	- Samvit, foundational consciousness is said to be of twelve kinds wherein end all, as this much is the main extent of the circle of force of the Lord.
etāvatā devadeva pūrṇaśaktiḥ sa bhairavaḥ | parāmarśātmakatvena visargākṣepayogataḥ |	It is by virtue of inherence of these forces in Him that He has become possessed of all forces as Bhairava is.

iha no likhitaṃ vyāsabhayāccānupayogataḥ | tā eva nirmalāḥ śuddhā aghorāḥ parikīrtitāḥ |	All this has not been recorded here out of the fear of becoming too lengthy as also unnecessarily. These forces are said to be blemishless and tranquilising.
tāsāmeva sthitaṃ rūpaṃ bahudhā pravibhajyate | upādhyatītaṃ yadrūpaṃ taddvadhā guravo jaguḥ |	Those which are more and more horrifying become so as per the occasion of their emergence. b- All this occurs as per the occasion of creation, sustenance, dissolution and beyond. Their status as per these states has been divided variously.
anullāsādupādhīnāṃ yadvā praśamayogataḥ | praśamaśca dvidhā śāntyā haṭhapākakrameṇa tu |	Pacification also is said of two kinds, namely, brought out through peaceful devices and through what is known as hatha-pāka, forceful burning of the lust towards life in the world.
alaṃgrāsarasākhyena satataṃ jvalanātmanā | haṭhapākapraśamanaṃ yattṛtīyaṃ tadeva ca | upadeśāya yujyeta bhedendhanavidāhakama | nijabodhajaṭharahutabhuji bhāvāḥ sarve samarpitā haṭhataḥ| vijahati bhedavibhāgaṃ nijaśaktyā taṃ samindhānāḥ |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Under the sādhanā of hatha-pāka the aspirant is required to take hold of the entire worldly sense, swallow it and feel as if he has tasted something most tasty. He should keep his radiance of this sense spreading all around like fire. This form of pacification of hatha-pāka is of the third order and hence the best. It needs to be taught as it is prone to burn down the entire stock of fuel of the sense of one's separateness from Siva .
haṭhapākena bhāvānāṃ rūpe bhinne vilāpite | aśnantyamṛtasādbhūtaṃ viśvaṃ saṃvittidevatāḥ | tāstṛptāḥ svātmanaḥ pūrṇaṃ hṛdayaikāntaśāyinam | cidvyomabhairavaṃ devamabhedenādhiśarete |	Putting the entire content of one's understanding deliberately into the digestive fire of one's wisdom through one's will-power makes one relieved of the sense of division. Being all the sense of diversity of things eliminated through hatha-pāka, the propitiating gift becomes ambrosial and is taken up by divinities of consciousness. Being thus propitiated these deities filled with the sense of their complete identity with heart-space, take resort to Him.
evaṃ kṛtyakriyāveśānnāmopāsābahutvataḥ| āsāṃ bahuvidhaṃṃ rūpamabhede'pyavabhāsate |	Due to this order of absorption in actions required to be undertaken and the consequent worship of a large variety of deities, their diversity is reflected even in the midst of the sense of oneness.
āsāmeva ca devīnāmāvāpodvāpayogataḥ| ekadvitricatuṣpañcaṣaṭsaptāṣṭanavottaraiḥ rudrārkānyakalāsenāprabhṛtirbhedavistaraḥ | |	Owing to withdrawal and manifestation of these very deities, there is enlargement of divine forces numbering one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, sixteen, eighteen, etc.

That person deserves to be considered as the pursuer of the śāmbhavopaya, path of Sambhu, in the inner being of whom this idea about the reality has got settled immovably.
pūrṇāhantāparāmarśoṃ yo'syāyaṃ pravivecitaḥ | mantramudrākriyopāsāstadanyā nātra kāścana | |	The person within whom this conviction has been formed at the root of the sense of “I”, does not need to chant or mutter any mantra, practise any psychophysical disposition, mudrā, ritual, worship, etc.
bhūyobhūyaḥ samāveśa nirvikalpamimaṃ śritaḥ | abhyeti bhairavībhāvaṃ jīvanmuktyaparābhidham |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Having entered into this kind of unflinching self-involvement by virtue of repeated practice, the aspirant attains the state of getting transformed into Bhairava which is a synonym of liberation.
ita eva prabhṛtyeṣā jīvanmuktirvicāryate | yatra sūtraṇayāpīyamupāyopeyakalpanā |	From this point onwards would be taken up the topic of deliberation on liberation of life with the end in view all this consideration on means and ends has been started.
prāktane tvāhnike kācidbhedasya kalanāpi no | tenānupāye tasminko mucyate vā kathaṃ kutaḥ |	In the prior Chapter there is not even a trace of deliberation on difference since that context has been devoted exclusively to show the paramountcy of Siva. Therefore, there was no scope there for deliberation on topics as to who gets liberated, from where, and by what device.
nirvikalpe parāmarśe śāmbhavopāyanāmani | pañcāśadbhedatāṃ pūrvasūtritāṃ yojayedbudhaḥ |	The aspirant needs to associate the fifty varieties of approaches as referred to in verse No. , of the first Chapter the optionless contemplation known as śāmbhava upāya, path relating to Sambhu, the Supreme Being or Siva.
dharāmevāvikalpena svātmani pratibimbitām| paśyabhairavatāṃ yāti jalādiṣvapyayaṃ vidhiḥ |	According to this method, the aspirant reaches the ultimate state of optionlessness of Bhairava by seeing himself as reflected in water, etc.
yāvadante paraṃ tattvaṃ samastāvaraṇordhvagam| vyāpi svatantraṃ sarvajñaṃ yacchivaṃ parikalpitam |	Transcending all superimpositions beginning from earth to what is pervading all of them is what has been conceived as Siva, the omniscient and autonomous.
tadapyakalpitodārasaṃviddarpaṇabimbitam | paśyanvikalpavikalo bhairavībhavati svayam | yathā raktaṃ puraḥ paśyannirvikalpakasaṃvidā| tattaddvāraniraṃśaikaghaṭasaṃvittisusthitaḥ | tadvaddharādikaikaikasaṃghātasamudāyataḥ| parāmṛśansvamātmānaṃ pūrṇa evāvabhāsate | |	Viewing Him as reflected on the comprehensive mirror of consciousness the aspirant is transported from amidst options to the state of Bhairava. This transformation happens on the pattern of viewing closely an earthen pitcher ultimately red in colour and formed by turnings on different points from the lower to the higher in different ways. Exactly on the pattern happens the case of the aspirant's realisation of himself internally as Siva from within considerations on each one of the earth, etc.
matta evoditamidaṃ mayyeva pratibimbitam | madabhinnamidaṃ ceti tridhopāyaḥ sa śāmbhavaḥ |	It is from myself that all this having been emerged, is being reflected on the mirror of my consciousness, and is no way different from myself. All these three ways of contemplation are Sāmbhava, related to Sambhu.
sṛṣṭeḥ sthiteḥ saṃhṛteśca tadetatsūtraṇaṃ kṛtam| yatra sthitaṃ yataśceti tadāha spandaśāsane |	Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu This is the summary mode of contemplation over creation, sustenance and withdrawal of the creation. This is what has been suggested in the Spanda- Kārikā.
etāvataiva hyaiśvaryaṃ saṃvidaḥ khyāpitaṃ param | viśvātmakatvaṃ cetyanyallakṣaṇaṃ kiṃ nu kathyatām | | svātmanyeva cidākāśe viśvamasmyavabhāsayan| sraṣṭā viśvātmaka iti prathayā bhairavātmatā |	It is in this way that gets established the glory of consciousness at its top. Apart from this universality what any other characteristic of it may need to be expounded! Contemplating well within his own space of consciousness that 'I am all-creating universal being', the aspirant attains oneness with Bhairava.
ṣaḍadhvajātaṃ nikhilaṃ mayyeva pratibimbitam | sthitikartāhamasmīti sphuṭeyaṃ viśvarūpatā |	All whatever having been born of the six-fold path is getting reflected well within me and hence I am the sustainer of it. It is in this kind of contemplation that obviously lies the aspirant's universality.
sadoditamahābodhajvālājaṭilatātmani | viśvaṃ dravati mayyetaditi paśyanpraśāmyati | |	The aspirant attains peace via arousal of the great awareness in his brilliantly flagrant flame of the fire of consciousness and the contemplation that it is also melting within me itself.
anantacitrasadgarbhasaṃsārasvapnasadmanaḥ| plauṣaka śiva evāhamityullāsī hutāśanaḥ |	I am Śiva, the Fire which is meant for burning the world as a house cherishing innumerable figures in the womb of it in course of the world seen as an extended dream.
jagatsarvaṃ mattaḥ prabhavati vibhedena bahudhā tathāpyetadrūḍhaṃ mayi vigalite tvatra na paraḥ | taditthaṃ yaḥ sṛṣṭisthitivilayamekīkṛtivaśā danaṃśaṃ paśyetsa sphurati hi turīyaṃ padamitaḥ | tadasminparamopāye śāmbhavādvaitaśālini | ke'pyeva yānti viśvāsa parameśena bhāvitāḥ |	That aspirant rises up from here to the fourth state of being who contemplates that the entire universe along with all its multiple varieties is born of me, is rooted in me, and following its dissolution nothing will remain. He who envisions the world integrally as one act of creation, sustenance and dissolution attains that state. There are only a few who having been confided in by the Supreme Lord in regard to this highest form of spiritual practice known as Sāmbhava-advaita, non- dualism with Sambhu as the Supreme Being deserve themselves the confidence.
snānaṃ vrataṃ dehaśuddhirdhāraṇā mantrayojanā | adhvaklṛptiryāgavidhirhomajapyasamādhayaḥ | ityādikalpanā kāpi nātra bhedena yujyate | parānugrahakāritvamatrasthasya sphuṭaṃ sthitam |	Sacred both, vow, clearance of the body, sustenance in meditation, recitation of mantras, taking to a certain sacred path, offering to fire, japa, entering into deep meditative trance, any of these observances is not undertaken in this context with the sense of duality from the Supreme Being.
yadi tādṛganugrāhyo daiśikasyopasarpati| athāsau tādṛśo na syādbhavabhaktyā ca bhāvitaḥ | | taṃ cārādhayate bhāvitādṛśānugraheritaḥ| tadā vicitraṃ dīkṣādividhiṃ śikṣeta kovidaḥ | |	-a Method of Expositing Oneself to Sambhu Grace of the teacher is necessarily made available to such a deserving aspirant whenever he approaches the teacher. If he has not become so in every respect but is filled with the sense of devotion to Siva, the wise teacher needs to prepare him on that line prior to conducting the ceremony of initiation.
bhāvinyo'pi hyupāsāstā atraivāyānti niṣṭhitim | etanmayatvaṃ paramaṃ prāpyaṃ nirvarṇyate śivam |	b- An aspirant of such qualifications necessarily develops other virtues such as worships, etc. by virtue of his constancy in his dedication to Siva via the method of āņava sādhanā and thus ends up with the attainment of the Supreme Siva.
iti kathitamidaṃ suvistaraṃ paramaṃ śāmbhavamātmavedanam |	This is how I have given a detailed presentation of the method of expositing oneself to Sambhu.
atha śāktamupāyamaṇḍalaṃ kathayāmaḥ paramātmasaṃvide | anantarāhnikokte'sminsvabhāve pārameśvare | pravivikṣurvikalpasya kuryātsaṃskāramañjasā |	Now we are proposing to expound the means of attaining the Supreme Self via the Sākta method of devotion. The aspirant of entering into the stream of the Divine Consciousness, which has been expounded in the immediately previous Chapter, needs to purify himself as soon as possible.
vikalpa saṃskṛtaḥ sūte vikalpaṃ syādātmasaṃskṛtam| svatulyaṃ so'pi so'pyanyaṃ so'pyanyaṃ sadṛśātmakam |	One option having been purified gives rise to another option of self-purification equal to itself, the other one to the next and the next to its next.
caturvveva vikalpeṣu yaḥ saṃskāraḥ kramādasau | asphuṭaḥ sphuṭatābhāvī prasphuṭansphuṭitātmakaḥ |	Thus, on reaching the state of the fourth option gradually what was unmanifest comes to the state of getting clarified. This process of manifestation goes on from the comparative to the superlative degree intervened by sub-degrees within each pair itself.
tataḥ sphuṭatamodāratādrūpyaparibṛṃhitā saṃvidabhyeti vimalāmavikalpasvarūpatām | ataśca bhairavīyaṃ yattejaḥ saṃvitsvabhāvakam | bhūyo bhūyo vimṛśatāṃ jāyate tatsphuṭātmatā | nanu saṃvitparāmraṣṭrī parāmarśamayī svataḥ | parāmṛśyā kathaṃ tāthārūpyasṛṣṭau tu sā jaḍā |	Proceeding on this line of self-purification, ultimately, the aspirant arrives at the last state of perfect purification which is as comprehensive and clean as to grow into the sense of optionless identification. Thus, comes that state of natural identification with the consciousness itself via repeated contemplation where things become absolutely obvious. Now the question is that consciousness is the agent of contemplation and as such it cannot be made an object of contemplation, since that act would make it to be treated as something objective and inconscient.
ucyate svātmasaṃvittiḥ svabhāvādeva nirbharā | nāsyāmapāsyaṃ nādheyaṃ kiṃcidityuditaṃ purā |	Self-consciousness is said to be naturally independent. In it is neither anything to be rejected nor to be included, this has already been stated.
kiṃ tu durghaṭakāritvāt svācchandyānnirmalādasau| svātmapracchādanakrīḍāpaṇḍitaḥ parameśvara |	śākta Upāya The Supreme Lord, however, owing to His being wonder-worker, autonomous and blemishless is the master of His sportiveness in self-concealment.
anāvṛte svarūpe'pi yadātmācchādanaṃ vibhoḥ| saiva māyā yato bheda etāvānviśvavṛttikaḥ |	Although His reality is quite obvious in His manifestation in the form of the world, He at the same time has kept Himself hidden behind it. This is by virtue of His force of māyā, self-concealment wherein also lies His universality.
tathābhāsanamevāsya dvaitamuktaṃ maheśituḥ | taddvayāpāsanenāyaṃ parāmarśo'bhidhīyate |	The Great Lord's appearance like the universe is redeemed of the sense of duality. Purpose of contemplation on Him lies in elimination of duality in regard to Him.
durbhedapādapasyāsya mūlaṃ kṛntanti kovidāḥ | dhārārūḍhena sattarkakuṭhāreṇeti niścayaḥ |	Wise people decidedly cut the root of this extremely hard tree of worldliness by means of true reasoning sharpening the edge of the axe.
tāmenāṃ bhāvanāmāhuḥ sarvakāmadughāṃ budhāḥ | sphuṭayedvastu yāpetaṃ manorathapadādapi | śrīpūrvaśāstre tatproktaṃ tarko yogāṅgamuttamam | heyādyālocanāttasmāttatra yatnaḥ praśasyate |	Wise people have characterised this true reasoning as bhāvanā, reflection, the cow milking whatever is wished for, in the form of manifestation even out of the sprouting in the soil of desire. In the Mālinivijayottara Tantra it has been observed that tarka, true reasoning is one of the best devices of yoga as by means of it, is determined what needs to be rejected, what needs special attention and hence putting in effort on this step of yoga is considered appreciable.
mārge cetaḥ sthirībhūtaṃ heye'pi viṣayecchayā | prerya tena nayettāvadyāvatpadamanāmayam | mārgo'tra mokṣopāyaḥ sa heyaḥ śāstrāntaroditaḥ | viṣiṇoti nibadhnāti yecchā niyatisaṃgatam |	By means of this device of yoga the attention of an aspirant may be brought back even from worldly affairs where it might have got settled due to fascination for enjoyment of objects which need to be discarded so that the state of blemishlessness is restored. That path leading even to liberation needs to be discarded as indicated by other schools of thought if it binds the aspirant with the craving for objects to be offered by forces of determination.
rāgatattvaṃ tayoktaṃ yat tena tatrānurajyate | yathā sāmrājyasaṃbhogaṃ dṛṣṭvādṛṣṭvāthavādhame |	Rāga, attachment is that element due to which one gets fascinated in a certain object. Example of it is the lust for sovereignty, in matters seen or unseen and howsoever condemned.
bhoge rajyeta durbuddhistadvanmokṣe'pi rāgataḥ | sa evāṃśaka ityukta svabhāvākhyaḥ sa tu sphuṭam |	The ill-advised becomes fascinated towards an objective like liberation out of the sense of attachment. Such ill-advised persons are said to be doubtless and obviously he is guided by his tendency for enjoyment.
siddhūyaṅgamiti mokṣāya pratyūha iti kovidāḥ | śivaśāsanamāhātmyaṃ vidannayata eva hi |	Śākta Upāya Wise people look upon siddhis as an obstruction on the path of liberation. Consequently even though conversant with the significance of the doctrine of Saivism one may get attracted towards Vaisnavism, etc.
vaiṣṇavādyeṣu rajyeta mūḍho rāgeṇa rañjitaḥ | yatastāvati sā tasya vāmākhyā śaktiraiśvarī |	out of fascination for attachment of a certain kind. All this is due to the vāma, adverse, power of the Lord as advanced by Pañcaratras, Vairiñcas and Buddhists.
pāñcarātrikavairiñcasaugatādervijṛmbhate | dṛṣṭāḥ sāmrājyasaṃbhogaṃ nindantaḥ ke'pi bāliśa | na tu saṃtoṣataḥ sveṣu bhogeṣvāśīḥ pravartanāt|	-a Some childish people are seen condemning the joy of sovereignty also not out of satisfaction in their own enjoyment as is obvious from their expectation of blessings in their own engagements.
evaṃcibhairavāveśanindātatparamānasāḥ |	b-a This is due to such people having become corrupted by extremely terrible forces born of absorption in Bhairava.
āśvasto nottarītavyaṃ tena bhedamahārṇavāt | śrīkāmikāyāṃ proktaṃ ca pāśaprakaraṇe sphuṭam |	b- a It has clearly been stated in the context of dealing with trap in the Kāmika Sāstra that one who is a kaula from inside, Saiva from outside and in public view a Vaidika cannot cross the sea of dualism.
vedasāṃkhyapurāṇajñāḥ pāñcarātraparāyaṇāḥ| ye kecidṛṣayo dhīrāḥ śāstrāntaraparāyaṇāḥ | bauddhārhatādyāḥ sarve te vidyārāgeṇa rañjitāḥ| māyāpāśena baddhatvācchivadīkṣāṃ na vindate |	b Followers of the schools of Veda, Sānkhya, Purānas, Pāñcarātras and those who are serious seers and conversant with the knowledge of any other scriptures, Buddhists, Jains, all such people who are coloured with attachment in regard to erudition, are bound by the trap of māyā and hence do not get the opportunity of being initiated in Saivism.
rāgaśabdena ca proktaṃ rāgatattvaṃ niyāmakam | māyīye tacca taṃ yasmiñchāstre niyamayediti |	- The word rāga is indicative of attachment which suggests confinement. It is supposed to be illusory on account of restricting the attention of the individual to the path concerned alone.
mokṣo'pi vaiṣṇavāderyaḥ svasaṃkalpena bhāvitaḥ | paraprakṛtisāyujyaṃ yadvāpyānandarūpatā |	The state of liberation as practised by Vaisnavas and others is affected by their own imagination as it is characterised by getting unified with the higher Nature or as a state of sheer delight.
viśuddhacittamātraṃ vā dīpavatsaṃtatikṣayaḥ | sa savedyāpavedyātmapralayākalatāmayaḥ |	It is supposed to be the state of being in the form of absolutely purified inner being citta, or as one of stoppage of continuity of burning of the flame of the lamp of life.
taṃ prāpyāpi ciraṃ kālaṃ tadbhogābhogabhuktataḥ| tattattvapralayānte tu tadūrdhvaṃ sṛṣṭimāgataḥ | mantratvameti saṃbodhādananteśena kalpitāt | etaccāgre taniṣyāma ityāstāṃ tāvadatra tat |	Śākta Upāya Having attained that state and enjoyed the luxuries made available there in all profusion and for a long span of time until the incidence of dissolution, the individual has to return to the incoming creation in the form of mantra on account of him, having got awakened in understanding as conceived by the Lord of Infinity. This matter would be elaborated on further subsequently.
tenājñajanatāklṛptapravādairyo viḍambitaḥ | asadgurau rūḍhacitsa māyāpāśena rañjitaḥ |	- He who is confused by rumours spread by ignorant people and their imaginative theories has really got his mind fascinated by the trap of the bond of illusion and hence has come to develop faith in the false teacher.
so'pi sattarkayogena nīyate sadguruṃ prati | sattarka śuddhavidyaiva sā cecchā parameśituḥ |	Such a misguided person also may be brought back to a true teacher by means of right reasoning. Right reasoning, indeed, is the pure mode of understanding, suddha-vidyā, and, therefore, the will of the Supreme Lord.
śrīpūrvaśāstre tenoktaṃ sa yiyāsuḥ śivecchayā | bhuktimuktiprasiddhyarthaṃ nīyate sadguruṃ prati |	This is why the āgama texts also tell us that he who is inclined to go to Śiva is really owing to such a wish of Siva for the sake of enjoying the pleasure of this world as well as the beatitude of liberation and hence is brought to the genuine teacher.
śaktipātastu tatraiṣa kramikaḥ saṃpravartate | sthitvā yo'sadgurau śāstrāntare vā satpathaṃśritaḥ| | guruśāstragate sattve'sattve cātra vibhedakam | śaktipātasya vaicitryaṃ purastātpravivicyate |	Śrī Tantrāloka In his case, sakti-pāta, incidence of availability of favour of the teacher happens gradually as he stays first with the false teacher or remains following some different scripture and then comes to take resort to the right path. In this case the difference is due to taking resort to true and false ones in regard to both the teacher and the scripture.
uktaṃ svacchandaśāstre tat vaiṣṇavādyānpravādinaḥ | sarvānbhramayate māyā sāmokṣe mokṣalipsayā |	It has been observed in the Svacchanda Sāstra that it is māyā, the power of delusion, which deludes Vaisnavas, etc. by false concepts of the state of liberation to be understood as the true one due to their lust for liberation.
yastu rūḍho'pi tatrodyatparāmarśaviśāradaḥ| sa śuddhavidyāmāhātmyācchaktipātapavitritaḥ| ārohatyeva sanmārgaṃ pratyūhaparivarjitaḥ | sa tāvatkasyacittarka svata eva pravartate |	Even he who is established in such schools of liberation and has become conversant with the theory of the system, if becomes purified by the śakti-pāta under the glory of the pure mode of understanding, ascends the path of truth without any obstruction. This sort of transformation from false to true reasoning may happen in a certain person automatically.
sa ca sāṃsiddhikaḥ śāstre proktaḥ svapratyayātmakaḥ | kiraṇāyāṃ yadapyuktaṃ gurutaḥ śāstrataḥ svataḥ |	- śākta Upāya Such a person has been characterised in the scripture as sāmsiddhika and svapratyayātmaka, perfectly accomplished and self-discrete. In the Kirana Sāstra it has been laid down that enlightenment can come via anyone of the sources, namely, the teacher, the scripture and from within oneself.
tatrottarottaraṃ mukhyaṃ pūrvapūrva upāyaka | yasya svato'yaṃ sattarkaḥ sarvatraivādhikāravān |	From amongst these three sources, the later the source is put here; the more important it is while the earlier ones are just a means to it.
abhiṣiktaḥ svasaṃvittidevībhirdīkṣitaśca saḥ | sa eva sarvācāryāṇāṃ madhye mukhyaḥ prakīrtitaḥ |	The aspirant, in whom the right reasoning has sprouted automatically, deserves to be authorised in all respects. Being crowned by deities of self-consciousness as also initiated he occupies the main position among all the teachers.
tatsaṃnidhāne nānyeṣu kalpiteṣvadhikāritā | sa samastaṃ ca śāstrārthaṃ sattarkādeva manyate |	No one else deserves to be authorised in his presence. Such a teacher considers the essence of all śāstras, as lying in right reasoning.
śuddhavidyā hi tannāsti satyaṃ yadyanna bhāsayet | sarvaśāstrārthavettṛtvamakasmāccāsya jāyate |	That mode of understanding cannot be regarded as pure which does not reflect truth. It is from such a teacher that is born spontaneously the knowledgeability of all scriptures.
iti śrīpūrvavākye tadakasmāditi śabdataḥ | lokāprasiddho yo hetuḥ so'kasmāditi kathyate |	What has been used in the previous sentence as akasmāt literally means as follows: The reason which is not popular in usage is characterised as akasmāt, spontaneous.
sa caiṣa parameśvaraśuddhavidyāvijṛmbhitam | asya bhedāśca bahavo nirbhittiḥ sahabhittikaḥ |	That, indeed, is an outcome of the pure mode of understanding, suddha-vidyā of the Supreme Lord. The teacher conversant with this mode of understanding is of several kinds, i.e., Nirbhittika and Sahabhittika.
sarvagoṃśagataḥ so'pi mukhyamukhyāṃśaniṣṭhitaḥ | bhittiḥ paropajīvitvaṃ parā prajñātha tatkṛtiḥ |	- Bhitti is indicator of dependence on anyone else. The dependence may be exclusive or partial with the further specification of dependence in regard to the main matter or on the subsidiary. Higher wisdom is the output of the bhitti.
adṛṣṭamaṇḍalo'pyevaṃ yaḥ kaścidvetti tattvataḥ | sa siddhibhāgbhavennityaṃ sa yogī sa ca dīkṣitaḥ | |	If one understands the inner sense of the discipline essentially even without having seen any means of initiation such as the circle, he needs to be regarded as deserving siddhi, accomplishment, yogin and already initiated.
evaṃ yo vetti tattvena tasya nirvāṇagāminī | dīkṣā bhavediti proktaṃ tacchrītriśakaśāsane |	According to the Triśakā Śāstra, he who understands all this essentially, deserves to be initiated in the Nirvāna-gāmini diksā, initiation leading to the state of liberation.
akalpito gururjñeyaḥ sāṃsiddhika iti smṛtaḥ | yastu tadrūpabhāgātmabhāvanātaḥ paraṃ vinā | śāstravitsa guruḥ śāstre prokto'kalpitakalpakaḥ | tasyāpi bhedā utkṛṣṭamadhyamandādyupāyataḥ|	Such an innate teacher deserves to be regarded as an accomplished teacher. He has become worthy of that status automatically. That teacher is called akalpita kalpaka, introducer of novel ideas who has become Śākta Upāya teacher on account of his knowledge of scriptures. There are also categories of such teachers, namely, the best, medium and the ordinary.
bhāvanāto'tha vā dhyānājjapātsvapnādvratādbhuteḥ| prāpnotyakalpitodāramabhiṣeka mahāmatiḥ |	Such a wise teacher attains the status of automatically enlightened one by means of ideation, meditation, contemplation on mantras, dreams, vows and sacrificial offerings.
śrīmadvājasanīye śrīvīre śrībrahmayāmale | śrīsiddhāyāmidaṃ dhātrā proktamanyatra ca sphuṭam |	Besides elsewhere, this has been stated explicitly in Vajasaniya, Vira, Brahma- Yāmala and Siddha Tantra by the Sustainer of the world. The Lord of the entire world, O Dear, is addressed as Parameśvara on account of His serving as the self-willed initiator in the creation of the world.
tasya svecchāpravṛttatvāt kāraṇānantateṣyate | kadācidbhaktiyogena karmaṇā vidyayāpi vā | jñānadharmopadeśe mantrairvā dīkṣāyāpi vā| evamādyairanekaiśca prakāraiḥ parameśvaraḥ |	Sometimes this is so because of the sense of devotion, action on knowledge, teachings in knowledge, austerity, mantra and initiation and various other factors including grace on worldly people are also responsible for according on Him the status of Parameśvara, the Supreme Lord.
saṃsārariṇo'nugṛhṇāti viśvasya jagataḥ patiḥ | mātṛmaṇḍalasaṃbodhātsaṃskārāttapasaḥ priye |	Other factors responsible in His denomination as Parameśvara are redemption of creatures from the bondage of māyā, delusion, His address by the motherly divine forces, sanskāras and austerity.
dhyānādyogājjapājjñānānmantrārādhanato vratāt| samprāpyaṃ kulasāmānyaṃ jñānaṃ kaulikasiddhidam |	Śrī Tantrāloka By virtue of meditation, practice of yoga, contemplation on mantra, knowledge, prayer and vows the aspirant attains the understanding of the mystery of the kula and becomes a kaulika.
tattvajñānātmakaṃ sādhyaṃ yatra tatraiva dṛśyate | sa eva hi gurustatra hetukālaṃ prakalpyatām |	Means of elevation to the status of the knowledgeability of the essence tattva- jñāna are rarely met with. He who has assimilated them practically in himself deserves to be accepted as the teacher, let alone contemplation on cause and time of his emergence.
tattvajñānādṛte nānyallakṣaṇaṃ brahmayāmale | tatraiva coktaṃ sevāyāṃ kṛtāyāmavikalpataḥ |	According to the Brahma- Yāmala Tantra, there is no other qualification for choosing a teacher except for knowledge of the Ultimate Reality, Brahman. Therein is said to lie the relevance of exclusive service rendered to him.
sādhakasya na cetsiddhiḥ kiṃ kāryamiti codite | ātmīyamasya saṃjñānakrameṇa svātmadīkṣaṇam |	If even in spite of rendering such a service, the aspirant does not attain perfection, he should turn back to himself and get initiated by himself by evoking his self- knowledge.
sasphuratvaprasiddhyarthaṃ tataḥ sādhyaṃ prasiddhyati | anena svātmavijñānaṃ sasphuratvaprasādhakam |	The purpose of this self-initiation is to mobilise the essence of the mantra which is being practised on. Mobilisation of the essence of the mantra results in Śākta Upāya activation of the self-knowledge.
ukta mukhyatayācāryo bhavedyadi na sasphuraḥ | tatraiva ca punaḥ śrīmadraktārādhanakarmaṇi | vidhiṃ proktaṃ sadā kurvan māsenācārya ucyate | pakṣeṇa sādhako'rdhārdhāt putrakaḥ samayī tathā |	It has been observed in the Brahma-Yāmala Tantra that if one is unable to get a teacher capable of activating the mantra, by praying to Candikā regularly one becomes an ācārya within a month, within a fortnight Sādhaka, within a week Putraka and within four days less by quarter of a day Samayi. - In this process of initiation, Candikā Devi is supposed to perform the ceremony Herself as per the provision of the Sāstra.
dīkṣayejjapayogena raktadevī kramādyataḥ | guroralābhe proktasya vidhimetaṃ samācaret |	This method of initiation needs to be adopted in case of unavailability of the teacher. In the view of the Siddhā, it has been maintained that there are certain shortcomings in the study from books.
mate ca pustakādvidyādhyayane doṣa īdṛśaḥ | ukto yastena taddoṣābhāve'sau na niṣiddhatā |	If the case be of absence of such shortcomings, there need not be any prohibition in this regard.
mantradravyādiguptatve phalaṃ kimiti codite | pustakādhītavidyā ye dīkṣāsamayavarjitāḥ | tāmasāḥ parahiṃsādi vaśyādi carantyalam| na ca tattvavidustena doṣabhāja iti sphuṭam | |	Being asked about the result of maintaining secrecy in regard to mantra and money, etc., it has been observed that those who have acquired knowledge from study of books and are shorn of initiation and its preconditions, are of dark nature, tamogunis, and are likely to get involved in violence to creatures and practice of mesmerism on people, etc., without having understood the real essence of the school and hence are obviously prone to commit crime.
pūrvaṃ padayugaṃ vācyamanyonyaṃ hetuhetumat | yastu śāstraṃ vinā naiti śuddhavidyākhyasaṃvidam | guroḥ sa śāstramanvicchustaduktaṃ kramamācaret | yena kenāpyupāyena gurumārādhya bhaktitaḥ | taddīkṣākramayogena śāstrārthaṃ vettyasau tataḥ | abhiṣeka samāsādya yo bhavetsa tu kalpitaḥ |	- One who has not been able to receive the true knowledge from a suitable teacher and hence has remained uninitiated, should avail himself of the favour of the teacher anyway, praying to him with devotion, performing the acts as desired by the teacher so as to get revealed from him the pure knowledge expected to be transmitted from him. - Thus having been initiated by him, he should acquire the knowledge of the Sāstra and get the abhiseka ceremony of himself performed by him. As a result of all this he attains the status of a teacher, though only of the presumed kind, kalpita, which, however, becomes irrelevant eventually.
sannapyaśeṣapāśaughavinivartanakovidaḥ | yo yathākramayogena kasmiṃścichāstravastuni |	The aspirant should accord the status of the teacher to one in any case who might have studied the Samhitā thoroughly in at least anyone of the topics of the scripture and not to anyone lesser than that.
ākasmikaṃ vrajedbodhaṃ kalpitākalpito hi saḥ | tasya yo'kalpito bhāgaḥ sa tu śreṣṭhatamaḥ smṛtaḥ | utkarṣaḥ śuddhavidyāṃśatāratamyakṛto yataḥ | yathā bhedenādisiddhācchivānmuktaśivā hyadhaḥ |	The teacher ought to have acquired śākta Upāya the understanding also spontaneously ākasmika no matter be he presumed or unpresumed. In fact that part of his knowledge is the best which is spontaneous, as it is the result of awakening of the pure mode of knowledge. If one were to make gradation between the primeval Siva and a liberated Siva, he would consider the former as superior to the latter.
tathā sāṃsiddhikajñānādāhṛtajñānino'dhamāḥ tatsaṃnidhau nādhikārasteṣāṃ muktaśivātmavat |	Even so, one in whom the spring of knowledge has opened out spontaneously must be regarded as superior to another one who has become knowledgeable by gathering the same knowledge only from secondary sources.
kiṃ tu tūṣṇīṃ sthitiryaddhā kṛtyaṃ tadanuvartanam | yastvakalpitarupo'pi saṃvādadṛḍhatākṛte |	In the face of that teacher the latter type need not be assertive. Better he should either keep quiet or just follow him.
anyato labdhasaṃskāraḥ sa sākṣābhairavo guruḥ | yataḥ śāstrakramāttajjñagurūprajñānuśīlanāt | ātmapratyayitaṃ jñānaṃ pūrvatvābhairavāyate| tena śrīkiraṇoktaṃ yadgurutaḥ śāstrataḥ svataḥ |	Even in spite of being spontaneously awakened, he is open to receiving samskāra from other sources for the sake of fortification of himself in conversation; he needs to be regarded as of the rank of an actual Bhairava. This is so on account of the fact that on the one side he has enriched himself with the knowledge received from the tradition via the link of teachers and on the other has made it profounder by adding his own innovations to it and thus on account of bringing perfection to it he has made it of the rank of Bhairava.
tripratyayamidaṃ jñānamiti yacca niśāṭane | tatsaṃghātaviparyāsavigrahairbhāsate tathā | |	-a Therefore it has been observed by Kiraņa and Nisātana both that there are three sources of knowledge, namely, cumulation, reversal and analysis.
karaṇasya vicitratvādvicitrāmeva tāṃ chidam| kartuṃ vāsī ca ṭaṅka ca krakacaṃ cāpi gṛhṇate | |	b- Owing to peculiarity of action, there arises peculiarity of means in its accomplishment. For instance, for the sake of making one and the same hole in a piece of wood, the carpenter makes use of several implements such as saw etc.
tāvacca chedanaṃ hyekaṃ tathaivādyābhisaṃdhitaḥ | ityameva mitau vācyaṃ karaṇasya svakaṃ vapuḥ | |	Even so, needs to be stated in regard to the cultivation of the body of the disciple by the teacher.
na svatantraṃ svato mānaṃ kuryādadhigamaṃ haṭhāt | pramātrāśvāsaparyanto yato'dhigama ucyate | |	The disciple should not forcibly decide the means of understanding apart from the teacher. Act of understanding comes to completion with the satisfaction of the knower.
āśvāsaśca vicitro'sau śaktipātavaśāttathā | pramite'pi pramāṇānāmavakāśo'styataḥ sphuṭaḥ |	Nature of satisfaction also is peculiar. It ranges from favour of saktipāta, transfer of Divine grace by the enlightened teacher up to its validation. Even after understanding elements of validation there is a scope required for explicitness.
dṛṣṭvā dṛṣṭvā samāśliṣya ciraṃ saṃcarvya cetasā | priyā yaiḥ parituṣyeta kiṃ brūmaḥ kila tānprati |	- What can we say about those who may satisfy their beloveds by look at them, embracing them and moving along with them again and again.
itthaṃ ca mānasaṃplutyāmapi nādhigate gatiḥ | na vyarthatā nānavasthā nānyonyāśrayatāpi ca |	In the same way, in spite of a flood of evidence, the process of understanding neither stops at any point nor comes to its futility or limit or even interdependence of factors involved.
evaṃ yogāṅgamiyati tarka eva na cāparam | antarantaḥ parāmarśapāṭavātiśāya saḥ | |	Thus, the ultimate measurement of the validity of yoga is reasoning and not any other step of it as it alone is meant for the satisfaction of the process of contemplation more and more inwardly.
ahiṃsā satyamasteyabrahmacaryāparigrahāḥ | iti pañca yamāḥ sākṣātsaṃvittau nopayoginaḥ |	The five principles of control, namely non-violence, truth, non-stealing, self- continence and non-accumulation, have little to do directly in regard to consciousness.
tapaḥ prabhṛtayo ye ca niyamā yattathāsanam | prāṇāyāmāśca ye sarvametadbāhyavijṛmbhitam |	śākta Upāya So is the case with tapas, the principle of self-restraint, niyama, including cleanliness, yogic poses and breath-control, prānāyāma, as they all are concerned with matters external.
śrīmadvīrāvalau coktaṃ bodhamātre śivātmake| cittapralayabandhena pralīne śaśibhāskare | prāpte ca dvādaśe bhāge jīvāditye svabodhake | mokṣaḥ sa eva kathitaḥ prāṇāyāmo nirarthakaḥ |	It has been observed in the Virāvalithat on the entire stuff of consciousness having become occupied by Siva and the citta, inner being, having become merged into non-being and both prāņa and apāna becoming completely attenuated and the principle of life having reached the twelfth point of self-realisation, that is the state of liberation and hence the effort to control the prāna is useless.
prāṇāyāmo na kartavyaḥ śarīraṃ yena pīḍyate | rahasyaṃ vetti yo yatra sa muktaḥ sa ca mocakaḥ |	- Indeed, that breath-control need not to be practised which is painful to the body. Whosoever comes to understand the mystery of creation wheresoever, he becomes liberated as also proves to be the liberator.
pratyāhāraśca nāmāyamarthebhyo'kṣadhiyāṃ hi yaḥ | anibaddhasya bandhasya tadantaḥ kila kīlanam |	Withdrawal, pratyhāhāra, is the state of drawing back of the senses both external and internal from their respective objects and keeping them pinned down within, which otherwise wander freely as per their wish.
cittasya viṣaye kvāpi bandhanaṃ dhāraṇātmakam | tatsadṛgjñānasaṃtāno dhyānamastamitā param |	Dhāranā, fixing of the inner being, citta, on a certain object is known as dhāranā while extension of kindred string of ideas is known as attention, dhyāna.
yadā tu jñeyatādātmyameva saṃvidi jāyate | grāhyagrahaṇatādvaitaśūnyateyaṃ samāhitiḥ |	Samādhi is that state in which oneness is attained between the consciousness and its object owing to nullification of duality between the object of knowledge and the process of knowing.
tadeṣā dhāraṇādhyānasamādhitritayī param | saṃvidaṃ prati no kaṃcidupayogaṃ samaśnute | yogāṅgatā yamādestu samādhyantasya varṇyate| svapūrvapūrvopāyatvādantyatarkopayogataḥ |	Yama, niyama, etc., are the means to their succeeding steps accordingly the earlier one of the steps having its utility in serving as the means of attaining its succeeding step ending up with reasoning as the ultimate one. All the steps of yoga have their relevance only up to the body, prāna, life- force, and the intellect but by no means to consciousness.
antaḥ saṃvidi rūḍhaṃ hi taddvārā prāṇadehayoḥ | buddhau vārghyaṃ tadabhyāsānnaiṣa nyāyastu saṃvidi | atha vāsmadṛśi prāṇadhīdehāderapi sphuṭam | sarvātmakatvāttatrastho'pyabhyāso'nyavyapohanam |	They may bring some modification to the exterior factors but by no means to the inmost consciousness as it is immune to any modification whatsoever. From our viewpoint, since prāna, body and intellect are centred in consciousness śākta Upāya owing to the latter's all-pervasiveness, whatever practice is put-in in regard to consciousness is applicable equally well to these also. It is the nature of the body to jump upward though followed by falling downward.
deha utplutisaṃpātadharmojjigamiṣārasāt | utplāvyate tadvipakṣapātāśaṅkāvyapohanāt |	Jumping upward is a matter of enjoyment. One jumps upward by way of removing the doubt of remaining stuck down.
guruvākyapadāmarśasadṛśe svavimarśane | prabuddhe tadvipakṣāṇāṃ vyudāsaḥ pāṭhacintane | nahyasya guruṇā śakyaṃ svaṃ jñānaṃ śabda eva vā | dhiyi ropayituṃ tena svaprabodhakramo dhruvam | ata eva svapnakāle śrute tatrāpi vastuni | tādātmyabhāvajñāyogo na phalāya na bhaṇyate | |	Under the instruction of the teacher when a disciple engages himself in contemplation over a certain lesson, he not only obtains a certain new insight but also gets his ignorance removed concerning what is opposed to it. It is not within the capability of any teacher to transplant his knowledge or even the word within the disciple. As such, self-contemplation on the part of the disciple is a must in the process of learning. In the state of dream, it is due to contemplative identification with the object concerned that the dreamer has its effect on himself which cannot be denied entirely.
saṃketānādare śabdaniṣṭhamāmarśaniṃ paṭhiḥ | tadādare tadarthastu cinteti paricarcyatām |	Disrespect to the instruction of the teacher in any casc needs to be kept confined Śrī Tantrāloka only to its verbal form while giving respect to it includes understanding of its inner sense which requires discussion, etc.
tadadvayāyāṃ saṃvittāvabhyāso'nupayogavān | kevalaṃ dvaitamālinyaśaṅkānirmūlanāya saḥ |	Practice of yama, niyama, etc., becomes useless on the awakening of non- dualistic consciousness. Its utility lies only in the elimination of the blemish of dualism.
dvaitaśaṅkāśca tarkeṇa tarkyanta iti varṇitam | tattarkasādhanāyāstu yamāderapyupāyatā |	Doubts of dualism get eliminated through reasoning, this has already been stated. Elimination of dualism is also the purpose of yama, etc., besides that of reason.
uktaṃ śrīpūrvaśāstre ca na dvaitaṃ nāpi cādvayam | liṅgapūjādikaṃ sarvamityupakramya śaṃbhunā | |	In the Mālinivijayottara Tantra, it has been stated by Sambhu that in the context of worship of emblem, linga-pūja, etc., there is the validity of neither dualism nor of non-dualism.
vihitaṃ sarvamevātra pratiṣiddhamathāpi vā| prāṇāyāmādikairaṅgairyogāḥ syuḥ kṛtrimā yataḥ | tattainākṛtakasyāsya kalāṃ nārhanti ṣoḍaśīm| kiṃ tvetadatra deveśi niyamena vidhīyate |	It has been made out there that all these are rather prohibited as yoga become artificial due to practice of such limbs of yoga as breath-control, etc., as they do not stand a comparison to even the sixteenth fraction of the practice as suggested by us. -a Śākta Upāya In our teaching, O Lady, this has been provided for in keeping with a system.
tattve cetaḥ sthiraṃ kāryaṃ tacca yasya yathāstviti | evaṃ dvaitaparāmarśanāśāya parameśvaraḥ | | kvacitsvabhāvamamalamāmṛśannaniśaṃ sthitaḥ | yaḥ svabhāvaparāmarśa indriyārthādyupāyataḥ |	The essence of the teaching is to stabilise the citta, inner being, anyhow as it may be possible. The Supreme Lord has observed that for the sake of elimination of the sense of duality one may take resort to any device as per his nature and observe transparency and constancy in that practice.
vinaiva tanmukho'nyo vā svātantryāttadvikalpanam | tacca svacchasvatantrātmaratnanirbhāsini sphuṭam | | bhāvaughe bhedasaṃdhātṛ svātmano naiśamucyate | tadeva tu samastārthanirbharātmaikagocaram |	This practice may be conducted through the involvement of the senses and their objects and without their involvement as is obvious from the autonomous nature of Śiva. b- Remaining immersed in the flood of diversity of objects is the state of night of ignorance for oneself while the same state gets transformed into the bright day-light of pure knowledge when reformed as ‘it is I myself who is appearing as all these objects and hence as 'I am all this".
śuddhavidyātmakaṃ sarvamevedamahamityalam | idaṃ vikalpanaṃ śuddhavidyārūpaṃ sphuṭātmakam |	This altered kind of experience is expressly of the quality of pure knowledge which is eliminative of the illusive alternate view of ideation promotive of difference.
snānaśuddhyarcanāhomadhyānajapyādiyogataḥ| viśvametatsvasaṃvittirasanirbharitaṃ rasāt |	-a It is contemplation under the format of pure knowledge which in various ways assumes the form of sacred bath, purification, worship, sacrifice, meditation, japa, etc.
ullāsibodhahutabhugdagdhaviśvendhanodite |	b-a His bath lies in besmearing his body with the brown ashes created by the burning of the world as a fuel in the jubilant fire of awareness.
sitabhasmani dehasya majjanaṃ snānamucyate | itthaṃ ca vihitasnānastarpitānantadevataḥ | tato'pi dehārambhīṇi tattvāni pariśodhayet | śivātmakeṣvapyeteṣu śuddhiryā vyatirekiṇī |	b-a Having performed his bath like this and thus having propitiated all the deities, he should purify all the constituent stuffs of the body. b-a In the midst of the understanding that all this world is Śiva, if there is anything impure, that is only the idea of impurity lurking in the mind of the person concerned. Removal of that idea from the inner being is, indeed, the act of purification.
saivāśuddhiḥ parākhyātā śuddhistaddhīvimardanam| evaṃ svadehaṃ bodhaikapātraṃ galitabhedakam | | paśyansaṃvittimātratve svatantre tiṣṭhati prabhuḥ| yatkicinmānasāhlādi yatra kvāpīndriyasthitau |	b-a Having thus made his body the sheer vessel meant for containing the awareness following the removal of its prior stuff of division from it, and by serving everything from that viewpoint, the aspirant remains like an autonomous lord of all this. b-a Sākta Upāya Whatever in this real abode of Brahman be looked as delightful and wheresoever the senses may be found as interested, that needs to be taken as the means of His worship.
yojyate brahmasaddhāmni pūjopakaraṇaṃ hi tat| pūjā nāma vibhinnasya bhāvaughasyāpi saṃgatiḥ |	b-a Pūjā, worship, is the unification of the flood of ideas with the consciousness of Bhairava which is autonomous, pure and infinite.
svatantravimalānantabhairavīyacidātmanā | tathāhi saṃvideveyamantarbāhyobhayātmanā |	b-a It is the consciousness itself which is pervading outside as well as inside working autonomously in the form of contemplation.
svātantryādvartamānaiva parāmarśasvarūpiṇī | sa ca dvādaśadhā tatra sarvamantarbhavedyataḥ |	b-a Contemplation is of twelve kinds and includes all within it. It is the sun itself which in the form of the moon is really the consciousness in the form of twelve kalās, phases.
sā ca mātari vijñāne māne karaṇagocare | meye caturvidhaṃ bhāti rūpamāśritya sarvadā |	b- That supernal consciousness exists in the knower, the knowledge, the object of knowledge and the senses in the three states, i.e., creation, sustenance and dissolution and thus in all twelve forms.
śuddhasaṃvinmayī prācye jñāne śabdanarūpiṇī | karaṇe grahaṇākārā yataḥ śrīyogasaṃcare |	At the primary stage, consciousness remains pure but coming down to the knower and assuming of the form of word as well as taking up the role of the medium of its reception, it becomes available to its sense organ, as has been maintained in the Yoga-sañcara.
ye cakṣurmaṇḍale śvete pratyakṣe parameśvari | ṣoḍaśāraṃ dvādaśāraṃ tatrasthaṃ cakramuttamam |	O Supreme Lady, the white circles of the eyes are sixteen-petalled and twelve- petalled rings obviously visible to us and of the highest order. Around the white circles are the red ones.
prativāraṇavadrakte tadbahirye taducyate | dvitīyaṃ madhyage ye te kṛṣṇaśvete ca maṇḍale | |	In the midst of the red are the black and white ones.
tadantarye sthite śuddhe bhinnāñjanasamaprabhe| caturdale tu te jñeye agnīṣomātmake priye |	The interior-most are the black ones, as black as pure ointment Kohl. Each one of them is four-petalled and is of the nature of fire right and moon left, O Dear.
mithunatve sthite ye ca cakre dve parameśvari | saṃmīlanonmīlanaṃ te anyonyaṃ vidadhātake |	- These eyeballs lie in their respective places mutually as couples. O Supreme Goddess, and they perform opening and closing of eyelids with respect to each other.
yathā yoniśca liṅgaṃ ca saṃyogātstravato'mṛtam | tathāmṛtāgnisaṃyogāddravataste na saṃśayaḥ |	As the male and female organs of reproduction effuse their fluids of immortality when they come into contact with each other, even so the sixteen-petalled circle of delight and the eight-petalled circle of fire when come into contact with each other effuse the world in all its profundity and variety undoubtedly.
taccakrapīḍanādrātrau jyotirbhātyarkasomagam | tāṃ dṛṣṭvā paramāṃ jyotsnā kālajñānaṃ pravartate |	Sākta Upāya At night when the solar and lunar lights spread their illumination by getting mixed up with each other then is born the light of fire which is supreme and results in the knowledge of time. NOTE: The solar light stands for the valid knowledge, prāmāna, while the lunar for the object of knowledge, prameya.
sahasrāraṃ bhaveccakraṃ tābhyāmupari saṃsthitam | tataścakrātsamudbhūtaṃ bahmāṇḍaṃ tadudāhṛtam |	That is why it is supposed to be superior to both of them, paramā jyotsnā. The thousand-petalled circle lies above both of them. It is out of this circle, cakra, that is born the egg of Brahman.
tatrasthāṃ muñcate dhārāṃ somo hyagnipradīpitaḥ | sṛjatītthaṃ jagatsarvamātmanyātmanyanantakam |	It is so stated. Being set to burn by fire Soma releases its stream lying held there. Thus is created the whole universe by and within each of its beings.
ṣoḍaśadvādaśārābhyāmaṣṭāreṣvatha sarvaśaḥ | evaṃ krameṇa sarvatra cakreṣvamṛtamuttamam |	Soma effuses the fluid of immortality in all the cakras, circles, sixteen-petalled, twelve-petalled, eight-petalled, etc., gradually one after the other.
somaḥ sravati yāvacca pañcānāṃ cakrapaddhatiḥ | tatpunaḥ pibati prītyā haṃso haṃsa iti sphuran | |	This process continues up to creation of the five gross elements. As a result of this kind of creation the Self drinks the fluid of immortality delightfully uttering the sound ham-sa.
sakṛdyasya tu saṃśrutyā puṇyapāpairna lipyate |	- By getting to listen to the word ham-sa even only once, the individual becomes immune to the effect of both, virtue and vice.
pañcāre savikāro'tha bhūtvā somasrutāmṛtāt | dhāvati trirasārāṇi guhyacakrāṇyasau vibhuḥ | yato jātaṃ jagallīnaṃ yatra ca svakalīlayā |	a Now, the Self, jiva, being embodied in the bodily structure of the five gross elements becomes affected due to relishing the drink of the effusion of immortality known as Soma moves in the secret circles flowing three kinds of fluids water, semen and blood notwithstanding being the all-pervading Lord Himself.
tatrānandaśca sarvasya brahmacārī ca tatparaḥ| tatra siddhiśca muktiśca samaṃ saṃprāpyate dvayam | ata ūrdhvaṃ punaryāti yāvaddbrahmātmakaṃ padam | agnīṣomau samau tatra sṛjyete cātmanātmani |	Thus, He sports within Himself from whom is born the universe as well as in whom it is destined to get merged at the end. b- Here, in Him, lies the delight of all, particularly of one who observes self- continence remaining absorbed in Him. Herein lie together both fulfilment and liberation. Above it lies the abode of Brahman where the subject and the object are viewed as equivalent to each other within oneself.
tatrasthastāpitaḥ somo dvedhā jaṅghe vyavasthitaḥ| adhastaṃ pātayedagniramṛtaṃ sravati kṣaṇāt | |	The objective sense of the world lying in the thighs is pushed still downward by the subjective represented by fire, effuses the ambrosia within a second.
gulphajānvādiṣu vyaktaṃ kuṭilārkapradīpitā | sā śaktistāpitā bhūyaḥ pañcārādikramaṃ sṛjet |	śākta Upāya The śakti, power of kundalini lying in the ankles having been stimulated by the sun makes the ambrosia fall still downward and create the sense of five gross elements.
evaṃ śrotre'pi vijñeyaṃ yāvatpādāntagocaram pādāṅguṣṭhātsamārabhya yāvad brahmāṇḍadarśanam | |	This sense obtains up to the senses of action, too, beginning from the toe up to the point of seeing Brahman.
ityajānannaiva yogī jānanviśvaprabhurbhavet | jvalannivāsau brahmādyairdṛśyate parameśvaraḥ |	- One who is ignorant of this secret is no yogin at all, while he who is aware of it deserves to be regarded as having become the Lord Himself.
tatra tātparyataḥ proktamakṣe kramacatuṣṭayam | ekaikatra yatastena dvādaśātmakatoditā |	Each one of the sense organs needs to be viewed in four perspectives, i.e., creation, sustenance, dissolution and the inexplicable as also in the capacity of the knower, the object of knowledge and the measurement of knowledge. Thus, each one of the senses maybe conceived in twelve capacities.
na vyākhyātaṃ tu nirbhajya yato'tisarahasyakam | meye'pi devī tiṣṭhantī māsarāśyādirūpiṇī | |	I am stopping myself at this point from any further analysis in this regard as the matter is too secret. In the capacity of playing the role of the object of knowledge also the Goddess appears in twelve forms as is obvious from the number of months, astrological houses, etc.
ata eṣā sthitā saṃvidantarbāhyobhayātmanā| svayaṃ nirbhāsya tantrānyadbhāsayantīva bhāsate | tataśca prāgiyaṃ śuddhā tathābhāsanasotsukā| sṛṣṭiṃ kalayate devo tannāmnāgama ucyate |	Thus by obtaining internally as well as externally one and the same consciousness illumines itself as well as everything else whatever. In this way, prior to involvement in the act of creation consciousness remains in its pure form reflecting itself only as keen to get manifested. It is out of that keenness that it conceives of creation and hence is called in the āgama Sāstra as per the form of its creation.
tathā bhāsitavastvaṃśarañjanāṃ sā bahirmukhī | svavṛtticakreṇa samaṃ tato'pi kalayantyalam | sthitireṣaiva bhāvasya tāmantarmukhatārasāt | saṃjihīrṣuḥ sthiternāśaṃ kalayantī nirucyate |	On account of its tendency of externalisation it makes itself reflect as coloured by the variety of objects in the world in keeping with its own modes of manifestation. The delightful bodily essence which is as subtle as a hundredth part of a hair existing in all the bodies is the cause of the creation as well as sustenance. Whatever is the source of its birth is also the point of its merger.
tato'pi saṃhārarase pūrṇa vighnakarīṃ svayam | śaṅkāṃ yamātmikāṃ bhāge sūte saṃharate'pi ca | saṃhṛtya śaṅkāṃ śaṅkyārthavarjaṃ vā bhāvamaṇḍale | saṃhṛtiṃ kalayatyeva svātmavahnau vilāpanāt | vilāpanātmikāṃ tāṃ ca bhāvasaṃhṛtimātmani | āmṛśatyeva yenaiṣā mayā grastamiti sphuret |	After that creation as well as sustenance and advent of the time of withdrawal and dissolution, the same force sakti of consciousness gives rise to the state of suspense in regard to the viability of sustenance and hence also dissolves the world. Having brought to an end the state of suspense except for the existence of entities Śākta Upāya in the circle of contemplation, the same force of consciousness contemplates dissolution in the fire of itself. There should arise the idea in consciousness which has dissolved the entire world within itself that it is itself which has dissolved all within itself.
saṃhāryopādhiretasyāḥ svasvabhāvo hi saṃvidaḥ | nirupādhini yaṃśuddhe saṃvidrupe'stamīyate |	It is the nature of consciousness that having accomplished the task of dissolution it dissolves itself within itself in its pure consciousness.
vilāpite'pi bhāvaughe kaṃcidbhāvaṃ tadaiva sā | āśyānayedya evāste śaṅkā saṃskārarūpakaḥ |	Following the dissolution of entities, the consciousness-force is likely to keep reserved within itself certain ideas immediately at that time so as to develop them in the form of impressions, samskāras.
śubhāśubhatayā so'yaṃ soṣyate phalasaṃpadam| pūrvaṃ hi bhogātpaśvādvā śaṅkeyaṃ vyavatiṣṭhate |	It is these archetypal ideas which bear the fruits of virtue and vice. This evaluative suspense follows the sufferance.
anyadāśyānitamapi tadaiva drāvayediyam | prāyaścittādikarmabhyo brahmahatyādikarmavat |	Consciousness is likely to give enlargement to some other impressions also on some such pattern as it happens in the case of propitiation of killing of a Brāhmana, etc.
itthaṃ bhogye'pi saṃbhukte sati tatkaraṇānyapi | saṃharantī kalayate dvādaśaivāhamātmani |	Whatever may be the form of its action, all is intended for the sake of the knower. Thus it acts in promoting enjoyment as well as in restraining the senses from the enjoyment.
karmabuddhyakṣavargo hi buddhayanto dvādaśātmakaḥ | prakāśakatvātsūryātmā bhinne vastuni jṛmbhate |	In the case of restraint from enjoyment, it withdraws the senses in all their twelve varieties in the Self. The twelve varieties of action depend on five organs of action, five organs of sense, manas, and intellect.
ahaṃkārastu karaṇamabhimānaikasādhanam| avicchinnaparāmarśī līyate tena tatra saḥ |	Ego is merely a means as it takes the responsibility of all actions on itself in the form of ‘I have done all this'. Thus contemplation ends therein.
yathāhi khaḍgapāśāde karaṇasya vibhedinaḥ | abhedini svahastādau layastadvadayaṃ vidhiḥ |	Elucidations of this are sword, trap, etc., as means of different kinds of action having the responsibility of their use in the hands of the warrior concerned.
tenendriyaughamārtaṇḍamaṇḍalaṃ kalayetsvayam | saṃviddevī svatantratvātkalpite'haṃkṛtātmani | | sa eva paramāditya pūrṇakalpastrayodaśaḥ | karaṇatvātprayātyeva kartari pralayaṃ sphuṭam |	Therefore, the Goddess of consciousness in the form of ego should take herself Sākta Upāya as one with the orb of the sun along with the circle of organs of action, sense, manas and intellect. It is that sun which as the thirteenth principle ruling over the twelve forms of the organs of action and knowledge and serving as the means of the Lord obviously merges into Him, the real actor.
kartā ca dvividhaḥ proktaḥ kalpitākalpitātmakaḥ | kalpito dehabuddhyādivyavacchedena carcitaḥ | |	The actor is of two kinds, supposed and actual. Supposed actor is the body, the organs of action, sense, manas and intellect presumed as actor on account of the limitation of the cognisance of the actual Actor.
kālāgnirudrasaṃjñāsya śāstreṣu paribhāṣitā | kālo vyavacchittadyukto vahnirbhoktā yataḥ smṛtaḥ | saṃsārāklṛptibhyāṃ rodhanād drāvaṇātprabhuḥ | anivṛttapaśūbhāvastatrāhaṃkṛtpralīyate |	The fire of time is named in the texts as Rudra. It is called time on account of being of the nature of limitation, while fire on account of being inclined to enjoyment. Due to being involved in the worldly constrictions and cherishing the idea of enjoyment, it has its animal nature not removed wherein its ego is immersed.
so'pi kalpitavṛttitvādviśvābhedaikaśālinī | vikāsini mahākāle līyate'hamidaṃmaye |	It has to behave within the parameters of the world and has to get immersed Sri Tantrāloka in the great span of time divided between the dichotomy of ‘I’ and ‘this', the subject and the object.
etasyāṃ svātmasaṃvittāvidaṃ sarvamahaṃ vibhuḥ | iti pravikasadrūpā saṃvittiravabhāsate |	In this self-awareness is reflected the alternative consciousness that I am all- pervading Lord.
tato'ntaḥsthitasarvātmabhāvabhogoparāgiṇī | paripūrṇāpi saṃvittirakule dhāmni līyate |	As a consequence of this sense developing within and enjoying the status of enjoyment of all, the full consciousness merges in the highest abode which is rid of all specifications.
pramātṛvargo mānaughaḥ pramāśca bahudhā sthitāḥ | meyaugha iti yatsarvamatra cinmātrameva tat |	The knower, the parameters of knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knowledge itself which are existing in diverse forms in the world are really only different forms of consciousness itself.
iyatīṃ rūpavaicitrīmāśrayantyāḥ svasaṃvidaḥ| svācchandyamanapekṣaṃ yatsā parā parameśvarī |	The Supreme Force of Consciousness appearing as self-consciousness assumes all these peculiar forms out of its self-autonomy depending on no one else.
mā prāguktakalanāstadvijṛbhbhocyate yataḥ | kṣepo jñānaṃ ca saṃkhyānaṃ gatirnāda iti kramāt |	All these features of consciousness are just its perspectives emerging out of its multifacetedness as indicated by the use of the word Kāli for it rooted in the Sākta Upāya Sanskrit root kal to mean as many as five actions, namely, to throw out, to know, to count, to move and to make sound.
svātmano bhedanaṃ kṣepo bheditasyāvikalpanam | jñānaṃ vikalpa saṃkhyānamanyato vyatibhedanāt |	Division of oneself is throwing out, persistence of divisions is knowledge, counting otherwise is option, movement is ascension upward and reflection, making sound is leaving the impression of self-contemplation by inversion.
itipañcavidhāmenāṃ kalanāṃ kurvatī parā| devī kālī tathā kālakarṣiṇī ceti kathyate | mātṛsadbhāvasaṃjñāsyāstenoktā yatpramātṛṣu | etāvadantasaṃvittau pramātṛtvaṃ saphuṭībhavet |	On account of performing all these five actions, as indicated by the root kal, the Supreme Being as the force of consciousness is also known as the goddess Kāli and Kālakarsini It is known Mātr-sadbhāva as it leaves the impression on the inner being of the knower that she has understood so much. This act of theirs is learnt as the goodwill of the Mothers.
vāmeśvarīti śabdena proktā śrīniśisaṃcare | itthaṃ dvādaśadhā saṃvittiṣṭhantī viśvamātṛṣu |	Thus, consciousness stays in the Universal Mothers in twelve ways.
ekaiveti na ko'pyasyāḥ kramasya niyamaḥ kvacit | kramābhāvānna yugapattadabhāvātkramo'ipi na |	The motherly goddess of consciousness is only one, nor is there any graduality in her. Due to absence of graduality, there is no simultaneity in her. Thus, there is neither graduality nor simultaneity in her.
kramākramakathātītaṃ saṃvittattvaṃ sunirmalam |	On account of absence of graduality and simultaneity both in her, consciousness is perfectly pure.
tadasyāḥ saṃvido devyā yatra kvāpi pravartanam | tatra tādātmyayogena pūjā pūrṇaiva vartate | parāmarśasvabhāvatvādetasyā yaḥ svayaṃ dhvaniḥ |	-a Wherever there is any worship of this goddess of consciousness, it is performed on the basis of becoming identified with her and thus alone happens the worship to be complete. b-a The sound of this goddess of consciousness is of the nature of self-contemplation. As such, it has been characterised as always manifest.
sadoditaḥ sa evoktaḥ paramaṃ hṛdayaṃ mahat | hṛdaye svavimarśo'sau drāvitāśeṣaviśvakaḥ |	That constant manifestation is its great secret, heart. b-a That self-contemplation in the heart expels the entire universe from it.
bhāvagrahādiparyantabhāvī sāmānyasaṃjñakaḥ | spandaḥ sa kathyate śāstre svātmanyucchalanātmakaḥ | |	So far as it continues to grasp usual objects it is known as usual. On becoming explosive, it is called in the Sāstra as Spanda, pulsation or vibration. b- Contemplation is some sort of movement amounting to self-vibration.
kiṃciccalanametāvadananyasphuraṇaṃ hi yat | ūrmireṣā vivodhābdherna saṃvidanayā vinā |	It is a vibration on the surface of the sea of understanding. If it were shorn of understanding, it would not have been conscious.
nistaraṅgataraṅgādivṛttireva hi sindhutā | sārametatsamastasya yaccitsāraṃ jaḍaṃ jagat |	śākta Upāya The characteristic feature of sea-hood is not being shorn of vibration. Indeed, vibration is the essential feature of the universe as a whole including the immobile as well as the mobile, inconscient as well as the conscient.
tadadhīnapratiṣṭhatvāttatsāraṃ hṛdayaṃ mahat | tathā hi sadidaṃ brahmamūlaṃ māyāṇḍasaṃjñitam |	Due to vibration being the basis of its existence, heart as the locus of movement is the essence of the sustenance of it. This is elucidated by the existence known as the egg of māyā, illusion, having its root in Brahman.
icchājñānakriyārohaṃ vinā naiva taducyate | tacchaktitritayārohābhairavīye cidātmani |	Existence is impossible to be called as such without will, knowledge and action as it is on account of ascension of this triad of forces on the conscious Self of Bhairava that existence is recognised as such.
visargaḥ parabodhena samākṣipyaiva vartate | tatsadeva bahīrūpaṃ prāgbodhāgnivilāpitam |	It is from within the existence that the world in all its variety as well as multiplicity emerges and gets externalised.
antarnadatparāmarśaśeṣībhūtaṃ tato'pyalam| khātmatvameva saprāptaṃ śaktitritayagocarāt | vedanātmakatāmetya saṃhārātmani līyate | idaṃ saṃsārahṛdayaṃ prācyaṃ sṛṣṭau ca hṛnmatam |	-a That existence itself having been externalised and having been burnt down by the fire of primeval consciousness, gets interiorised and remains only as voice of contemplation and thus assumes the form of a sheer vacuum of awareness by virtue of the triad of the force and that contemplation also eventually merges into the Self of dissolution. This is the primeval heart of the world while in course of the creation it has come to be known as heart, hrdaya.
etadrūpaparāmarśamakṛtrimamanāvilam | ahamityāhureṣaiva prakāśasya prakāśatā |	b- This form of contemplation is unartificial and blotless. This is aham and is the illumination of the Light.
etadvīryaṃ hi sarveṣāṃ mantrāṇāṃ hṛdayātmakam | vinānena jaḍāste syurjīvā iva vinā hṛdā |	Herein lies the essential virility of all mantras. Short of this virility, all mantras need to be taken as lifeless as living beings without the heart. All action is unartificial if done by remaining centred in the heart.
akṛtrimaitaddhṛdayārūḍho yatkiṃcidācaret| prāṇyādvā mṛśate vāpi sa sarvo'sya japo mataḥ | yadeva svecchatā sṛṣṭisvābhāvyādbahirantarā | nirmīyate tadevāsya dhyānaṃ syātpāramārthikam |	This may be taken to be true of even breathing and closing of the eyelids. All whatever he does becomes his japa, muttering of sacred sounds. Whatever the yogin of this order does out of his will in keeping with the nature of the creation, no matter in the external world or within himself, that needs to be taken as his meditation on the Supreme Being.
nirākāre hi ciddhāmni viśvākṛtimaye sati | phalārthināṃ kācideva dhyeyatvenākṛtiḥ sthitāḥ|	Sākta Upāya In the state of formlessness of the illumination of consciousness, or indeed in the state of it being in the form of the entire universe, there remains scarcely any form to serve the purpose of being meditated on for those who wish to gain any result out of their meditation.
yathā hyabhedātpūrṇe'pi bhāve jalamupāharan | anyākṛtyapahānena ghaṭamarthayate rasāt | tathaiva parameśānaniyatipravijṛmbhaṇāt | kācidevākṛtiḥ kāṃcit sūte phalavikalpanām |	As is the case with a pitcher meant for fetching water, no matter made of whatsoever material, its relevance lies only in carrying the water and not in the material it is made of, even so when the entire universe is viewed as just a display of the Supreme Being Himself, any form may produce any result as desired.
yastu saṃpūrṇahṛdayo na phalaṃ nāma vāñchati | tasya viśvākṛtirdevī sā cāvacchedavarjanāt |	He who is fulfilled in his heart and hence does not cherish any craving for anything, at his disposal lies there the Goddess in the form of the entire universe in all its limitlessness.
kule yogina udriktabhairavīyaparāsavāt | ghūrṇitasya sthitirdehe mudrā yā kacideva sā | antarindhanasaṃbhāramanapekṣyaiva nityaśaḥ | jājvalītyakhilākṣaughaprasṛtograśikhaḥ śikhī |	The yogin who has vacated his inner being exclusively for being filled fully with the essence of Bhairava to keep himself submerged in, whatever be the pose of his body, that needs to be taken as his mudrā, the prescribed form of pose in the state of meditation. Without any requisition for the stock of the internal fuel the fire of the inner being takes the form of an extremely bright flame.
bodhāgnau tādṛśe bhāvā viśantastasya sanmahaḥ| udrecayanto gacchanti homakarmanimittatām |	All entities in the form of reflections on the canvas of consciousness enter into that fire and get burnt down making the flame enhanced in its quantum serving as the material of offering.
yaṃ kaṃcitparameśānaśaktipātapavitritam | purobhāvya svayaṃ tiṣṭheduktavaddīkṣitastu saḥ |	- If there be anyone, no matter whosoever, sanctified by the graceful downpour of the divine force on him, he needs to be given priority as he needs to be considered as already initiated in the non-dualistic Saiva wisdom.
japyādau homaparyante yadyapyekaikakarmaṇi | udeti rūḍhi paramā tathāpītthaṃ nirūpitam |	Beginning from muttering of sacred words, japa, up to offering of libation to fire, homa, although there set practices already laid down in regard to each and every function, even then all these matters are being discussed here for the sake of reorientation.
yathāhi tatra tatrāśvaḥ samanimnonnatādiṣu | citre deśe vāhyamāno yātīcchāmātrakalpitām | tathā saṃvidvicitrābhiḥ śāntaghoratarādibhiḥ| bhaṅgībhirabhito dvaitaṃ tyājitā bhairavāyate |	As a horse, being made to run along a terrain even, low, plane, etc., and thus full of such peculiarities, moves on in keeping with the will of the rider, even so consciousness passing along peaceful, terrible, more terrible circumstances of dualism and ultimately having shed out all those peculiarities gets inclined to non-dualism of Bhairava.
yathā purasthe mukure nijaṃ vaktraṃ vibhāvayan | bhūyo bhūyastavekātma vaktraṃ vetti nijātmanaḥ | tathā vikalpamukure dhyānapūjārcanātmani | ātmānaṃ bhairavaṃ paśyannacirāttanmayībhavet |	- śākta Upāya As looking into the mirror put in front of himself, the observer sees in various ways again and again his own face, even so appearing before the optional mirror of the world and performing meditation, worship, prayer, etc., one needs to perceive oneself ultimately as Bhairava and get himself identified with Him without any delay.
tanmayībhavanaṃ nāma prāptiḥ sānuttarātmani | pūrṇatvasya parā kāṣṭhā setyatra na phalāntaram |	- Becoming one with Bhairava is the highest state of perfection and is in itself the ultimate result of all efforts in life requiring nothing else to achieve.
phalaṃ sarvamapūrṇatve tatra tatra prakalpitam | akalpite hi pūrṇatve phalamanyatkimucyatām |	Whatever results are conceived, all those presume only imperfection while perfection has remained unconceived, leaving no scope to wish for anything else.
eṣa yāgavidhiḥ ko'pi kasyāpi hṛdi vartate | yasya prasīdecciccakraṃ drāgapaścimajanmanaḥ | atra yāge gato rūḍhiṃ kaivalyamadhigacchati| lokairālokyamāno hi dehabandhavidhau sthitaḥ |	Such a rare person needs to be taken as that fortunate one whose cit cakra, circle of consciousness has attained the state of perfect peace and hence who has no need to be reborn. Śri Tantraloka One who has attained ascension in the performance of this sacrifice, has attained liberation in spite of the public looking at him as living under the bounds of the body.
atra nātha samācāraṃ paṭale'ṣṭādaśe'bhyadhāt | nātra śuddhirna cāśuddhirna bhakṣyādivicāraṇam | na dvaitaṃ nāpi cādvaitaṃ liṅgapūjādikaṃ na ca | na cāpi tatparityāgo niṣparigrahatāpi vā | saparigrahatā vāpi jaṭābhasmādisaṃgrahaḥ | tattyāgo na vratādīnāṃ caraṇācaraṇaṃ ca yat | |	In this regard, the course of life required to be taken up has been detailed out in the eighteenth chapter of the Mālinivijayottara Tantra which is as follows: "Here there is no consideration of purity and impurity nor of what is to be taken up as food and what is to be abstained from.” “There is no consideration of dualism or of non-dualism, nor even of worship of the emblem, linga, etc. Nor is there any insistence on the rejection of it if being practised or of taking to it if not already practised.” There is neither any provision for nor rejection of the practice of keeping long hair, applying ashes, etc.
kṣetrādisaṃpraveśaśca samayādiprapālanam| parasvarūpaliṅgādi nāmagotrādikaṃ ca yat |	The same is the case in regard to the form of the worship, human or emblematic as also name and the school, gotra.
nāsminvidhīyate kiṃcinna cāpi pratiṣidhyate | vihitaṃ sarvamevātra pratiṣiddhamathāpi ca |	Sākta Upāya There is no provision for anything here nor opposition to anything. Here everything needs to be understood as provided for as well as opposed to equally well.
kiṃ tvetadatra deveśi niyamena vidhīyate | tattve cetaḥ sthirīkāryaṃ suprasannena yoginā |	What, however, has been expected of the aspirant, O Goddess, is to fix the attention on the Essence with fully settled mind.
tacca yasya yathaiva syātsa tathaiva samācaret | tattve niścalacittastu bhuñjāno viṣayānapi | na saṃspṛśyeta doṣaiḥ sa padmapatramivāmbhasā | viṣāpahārimantrādisannaddho bhakṣayannapi |	That end needs to be met with in any possible way. With fully fixed mind one may enjoy any object or event and remain unaffected by the same like the leaf of lotus by water. Even being engaged in the pacification of the effect of poison or even tasting the same, the yogin of this order does not fall in a swoon, as he has become too strong in his consciousness to fall from it.
viṣaṃ na muhyate tena tadvadyogī mahāmatiḥ | aśudaṃ hi kathaṃ nāma dehādyaṃ pāñcabhautikam | prakāśatātirikte kiṃ śuddhayaśuddho hi vastutaḥ | aśuddhasya ca bhāvasya śuddhiḥ syāttādṛśaiva kim |	How can the body, etc be impure on account of having been constituted of the five gross elements while the position is that there is nothing in the world to be called pure or impure except for the illumination which is consciousness? -a How can anything impure be made pure by means of anything else which in itself is impure? In the case of the means of purification itself being impure, the task of purification of it would involve the fault.
anyonyāśrayavaiyarthyānavasthā itthamatra hi | pṛthivī jalataḥ śuddhayejjalaṃ dharaṇitastathā | anyonyāśrayatā seyamaśuddhatve'pyayaṃ kramaḥ | aśuddhājjalataḥ śuddhayeddhareti vyarthatā bhavet |	If the clay were to be purified by means of water and conversely water were to be purified by means of clay, there would be the fault of interdependence and hence meaninglessness in conceiving two impure things getting purified mutually with the help of each other; extending the same argument further on supposition of purification of air by means of water and of the air by means of fire or of the fire by means of anything else.
vāyuto vāriṇo vāyostejasastasya vānyataḥ | bahurūpādikā mantrāḥ pāvanātteṣu śuddhatā | |	Finally, on account of being of multi-forms, mantras may be regarded as pure by nature.
mantrā svabhāvataḥ śuddhā yadi te'pi na kiṃ tathā | śivātmatā teṣu śuddhiryadi tatrāpi sā na kim |	If they, too, not be pure, what else can be pure! Their purity lies in being of the nature of Siva. If purity be absent from here as well, where else would it be available.
śivātmatvāparijñānaṃ na mantreṣu dharādivat | te tena śuddhā iti cettajjñaptistarhi śuddhatā | yoginaṃ prati sā cāsti bhāveṣviti viśuddhatā | nanu codanayā śuddhyaśuddhayādikaviniścayaḥ |	b- The common man does not recognise everything as a form of Śiva but for the mantras as distinct from the earth, etc. Hence he considers the mantras as pure. In this admittance of the purity of mantras is the cause in cognisance of Saiva consciousness in them. In the case of yogins, however, purity of the Saiva consciousness is admitted in all objects of the world as well and hence is accepted the purity of all of them.
itthamastu tathāpyeṣā codanaiva śivoditā | kā syātsatīti cedetadanyatra pravitānitam | vaidikyā bādhiteyaṃ cedviparītaṃ na kiṃ bhavet | samyakcenmanyase bādho viśiṣṭaviṣayatvataḥ |	This being the state of things, what may be the truth, this has been expounded elsewhere. If it be apprehended that this Agamic viewpoint becomes contradicted by the Vedic, why can the opposite of it not be possible ? If the contradiction be regarded as valid, the āgamic viewpoint may be taken as an exception to it.
apavādena kartavyaḥ sāmānyavihite vidhau | śuddhyaśuddhī ca sāmānyavihite tattvabodhini |	-a The question of purity and impurity being admitted as meant for the common man, their contradiction may be treated as concerned with people specially enlightened in regard to the essence of things.
nārthavādādiśaṅkā ca vākye māheśvare bhavet |	b-a As regards the words of the Supreme Lord, there cannot be the doubt of their being meant just for adulation, arthavāda.
abuddhipūrvaṃ hi tathā saṃsthite satataṃ bhavet | vyomādirūpe nigame śaṅkā mithyārthatāṃ prati |	b In case of admittance like this, in regard to Vedic statement as those of ignorance, all Vedic propositions concerning space, etc., would become a suspect of falsehood.
anavacchinnavijñānavaiśvarūpyasunirbharaḥ | śāstrātmanā sthito devo mithyātvaṃ kvāpi nārhati |	Having His presence amongst us in the form of the scripture the Lord with all His unlimited knowledge revealed in the form of the entire universe does not deserve to be levelled the accusation of falsehood.
icchāvānbhāvarūpeṇa yathā tiṣṭhāsurīśvaraḥ | tatsvarūpābhidhānena tiṣṭhāsuḥ sa tathā sthitaḥ |	In whatever form the Lord wishes to appear in the world, He gets embodied Himself in that form as the meaning of the word concerned.
arthavādo'pi yatrānyavidhyādimukhamīkṣate | tatrāstvasatyaḥ svātantrye sa eva tu vidhāyakaḥ |	If there be made any statement concerning praise or condemnation of anything but only as subsidiary to recommendation of a certain act, its degradation from truthfulness would matter little if overall it is promotive of the recommendation.
vidhivākyāntare gacchannaṅgabhāvamathāpi vā| na nirarthaka evāyaṃ saṃnidhergajaḍādivat |	Any statement of condemnation or praise if subsidiary to the recommendatory, no matter being a part of the latter or falling in the midst of it, need not be taken as useless.
svārthapratyāyanaṃ cāsya svasaṃvittyaiva bhāsate | tadapahnavanaṃ kartuṃ śakyaṃ vidhiniṣedhayoḥ | |	In such cases the desired meaning becomes obvious to one's consciousness. In the case of rejection of such an understanding, on the contrary, the statements of recommendation, vidhi, and rejection, nisedha, both, too, become redundant.
yuktiścātrāsti vākyeṣu svasaṃviccāpyabādhitā| yā samagrārthamāṇikyatattvaniścayakāriṇī |	Sākta Upāya With the application of such a device along with the approval of one's own understanding, the concerned statement also becomes logical as the gem of its overall meaning becomes ascertained.
mṛtadehe'tha dehotthe yā cāśuddhiḥ prakīrtitā| anyatra neti buddhyantāmaśuddhaṃ saṃvidacyutam |	As regards the idea of impurity associated with the dead body and the output of it, it needs to be understood that the same is not applicable to the living body on account of its being associated with consciousness.
saṃvittādātmyamāpannaṃ sarvaṃ śuddhamataḥ sthitam | śrīmadvīrāvalau coktaṃ śaddhyaśuddhinirūpaṇe |	It leads to the conclusion that whatever is in oneness with consciousness, is pure.
sarveṣāṃ vāhako jīvo nāsti kiṃcidajīvakam | yatkiṃcijjīvarahitamaśuddhaṃ tadvijānata |	-a In the Virāvali Sāstra also it has been maintained on the problem of purity and impurity as follows: “Jiva, essence of life, is the bearer of all. As such there is nothing which is lifeless.
tasmādyatsaṃvido nātidūre tacchuddhimāvahet | avikalpena bhāvena manuyo'pi tathābhavan |	Therefore, what is not too far away from consciousness must carry purity with it. The same was the view held invariably by the sages also." b- They have kept concealed this essential secret with a view to keeping the interest of the safety of the society.
lokasaṃrakṣaṇārthaṃ tu tattattvaṃ taiḥ pragopitam bahi satsvapi bhāveṣu śuddhayaśuddhī na nīlavat | pramātṛdharma evāyaṃ cidaikyānaikyavedanāt|	In spite of the involvement of externality in the objects concerned, the problem of their purity and impurity is not so objective as the objectivity of blueness for instance . Since consciousness is prone to experience in one way or the other in a kindred situation, it is very much a matter of preference of the person concerned.
yadi vā vastudharmo'pi mātrapekṣānibandhanaḥ | | sautrāmaṇyāṃ surā hotuḥ śuddhānyasya viparyayaḥ | anena codanānāṃ ca svavākyairapi bādhanam | | kvacitsaṃdarśitaṃ brahmahatyāvidhiniṣedhavat | bhakṣyādividhayo'pyenaṃ nyāyamāśritya carcitāḥ |	-a Alternatively, when even the objective quality of anything becomes dependent on the bias of the knower, the situation becomes so flexible as wine to be recommended as a pure drink for the priest and prohibited for other Brāhmanas. In this way, scriptural statements become self-contradictory sometimes as is obvious from prescriptive and negative provisions concerning killing of a Brāhmaṇa, brahma-hatyā. b- The problem of eatability and non-eatability, etc., has been dealt with in keeping with this logic.
sarvajñānottarādau ca bhāṣate sma maheśvaraḥ | nararṣidevadruhiṇaviṣṇurudrādīritam | uttarottaravaiśiṣṭyāt pūrvapūrvaprabādhakam| na śaivaṃ vaiṣṇavairvākyairbādhanīyaṃ kadācana | |	In scriptures like Sarvajñānottara, Maheśvara, the Great Lord, has observed that in the context of statements of humans, seers, deities, Brahmā, Visnu and Rudra, etc., those of the earlier ones have been contradicted by those of the later ones owing to their special significance. As such, Saiva statements should be contradicted by the Vaisnava.
vaiṣṇavaṃ brahmasaṃbhūtairnetyādi paricarcayet | bādhate yo vaiparītyātsa mūḍhaḥ pāpabhāgbhavet |	- If it were to be contended that since Vaisnava statements have emerged from Brahman, they as well do not deserve to be contradicted, this will not hold good.
tasmānmukhyatayā skanda lokadharmānna cācaret | nānyaśāstrasamuddiṣṭaṃ srotasyuktaṃ nije caret | |	as it is said that he who does contrary to it, i.e., contradicts the latter by the Śākta Upāya Therefore, O Skanda, the aspirant should not perform popular rites nor should he act as per prescriptions of other scriptures.
yato yadyapi devena vedādyapi nirūpitam | tathāpi kila saṃkocabhāvābhāvavikalpataḥ |	Though it is the Divine Himself who has revealed the Veda and other scriptures but with the difference of degree in regard to the extent of expansion and contraction.
saṃkocatāratamyena pāśavaṃ jñānamīritam | vikāsatāratamyena patijñānaṃ tu bādhakam |	The knowledge concentric to the individual's viewpoint is contractive while on account of being expansive the knowledge of the Lord is contradictory of it.
idaṃ dvaitamidaṃ neti parasparaniṣedhataḥ māyīyabhedaklṛptaṃ tatsyādakālpanika katham |	Both these propositions are mutually contradictory. As such, how can there be reconciliation between what is affected by the divisions created by māyā, force of illusion, and what is realistic.
uktaṃ bhargaśikhāyāṃ ca mṛtyukālakalādikam | dvaitādvaitavikalpotthaṃ grasate kṛtadhīriti |	It has been observed in the Bharga-Sikhā that he who has cultivated his inmost being in keeping with the doctrine of non-dualistic Saivism swallows as a gross the ideas of death, time, division, etc., born of the suspense between dualism and non-dualism.
siddhānte liṅgapūjoktā viśvādhvamayatāvide| kulādiṣu niṣiddhāsau dehe viśvātmatāvide |	Here emphasis is laid for the initiate to attain identity with Siva. As regard curls of hair, etc., one is free to decide whether to keep or not as per his convenience.
iha sarvātmake kasmāttadvidhipratiṣedhane | niyamānupraveśena tādātmyapratipattaye |	-a Whatever vow is recommended here, that is meant for the understanding of the meaning of mantras. Prohibition of such vows, on the other hand, is meant for emphasising on the understanding of the universality of the mantras.
jaṭādi kaule tyāgo'sya sukhopāyopadeśataḥ | vratacaryā ca mantrārthatādātmyapratipattaye | | tanniṣedhastu mantrārthasārvātmyapratipattaye | kṣetrapīṭhopapīṭheṣu praveśo vighnaśāntaye |	b- a As regards entry into certain sacred areas, stations and substations, pitha and upa-pitha, the purpose behind it needs to be pacification of hindrances in the path of spiritual practice. It is recommended also for receiving mantras, etc., particularly for those who are worshippers of deities concerned.
mantrādyārādhakasyātha tallābhāyopadiśyate | kṣetrādigamanābhāvavidhistu svātmanastathā |	b-a The Doctrine of samayācāra is replete with provision and prohibitions. It is based on the admittance of duality.
bhedaprāṇatayā tattattyāgāttattvaviśuddhaye | samayādiniṣedhastu malaśāstreṣu kathyate |	Hence rejection of a certain observance is meant here for purification of the essence. In scriptures dealing with different opinions on a particular problem, different views are expressed on the problem concerned.
nirmaryādaṃ svasaṃbodhaṃ sapūrṇa buddhyatāmiti | parakīyamidaṃ rūpaṃ dhyeyametattu me nijam | |	In confrontation with these opinions, the initiate needs to understand how his viewpoint is free from restrictions and hence is perfect in itself. - a This form is other's while this one is ours and hence needs to be attended closely.
jvālādiliṅgaṃ cānyasya kapālādi tu me nijam |	Flame, etc. as emblems are someone else's while skull, etc. are ours.
ādiśabdāttapaścaryāvelātithyādi kathyate |	b-a Use of the word, etc., in this context is meant for referring to austerity, limitation, serving as a host, etc.
nāma śaktiśivādyantametasya mama nānyathā| gotraṃ ca gurusaṃtāno maṭhikākulaśabditaḥ |	b Names of Saivas of the non-dualistic school should end in Sakti and Siva and not otherwise. As regards the gotra, school, it should be indicative of the tradition of teachers, monastery and academic family.
śrīsaṃtatistryambakākhyā tadardhāmardasaṃjñitā | itthamardhacatastro'tra maṭhikā śāṃkare krame | yugakrameṇa kūrmādyā mīnāntā siddhasaṃtatiḥ | ādiśabdena ca gharaṃ pallī pīṭhopapīṭhakam |	Under the monastery of Sankara, four and a half monasteries have taken place until now while in keeping with the calculation on the line of yugas, traditions of saints have been formed in the name of kürma and mina. By the use of the word ādi, etc., in this context are implied the dwelling places, their clusters, stations, substations, emblems, divisions, their ownerships and rules.
mudrā chummeti teṣāṃ ca vidhānaṃ svaparasthitam | tādātmyapratipattyai hi svaṃ saṃtānaṃ samāśrayet |	-a For the sake of tracing back one's lineage, the initiate should begin with one's own tradition.
bhuñjīta pūjayeccakraṃ parasaṃtāninā nahi| etacca mataśāstreṣu niṣiddhaṃ khaṇḍanā yataḥ |	Never should he eat or worship the cakra in keeping with some other tradition. b-a This has been prohibited in Mat Sāstra as it involves division.
akhaṇḍe'pi pare tattve bhedenānena jāyate | evaṃ kṣetrapraveśādi saṃtānaniyamāntataḥ | nāsminvidhīyate taddhi sākṣānnaupayika śive | na tasya ca niṣedho yanna tattattvasya khaṇḍanam |	It imputes division to the supreme essence which is undivided. b-a Thus in our non-dualistic Saivism, principles beginning from entry into a particular area up to the observance of the tradition are neither permitted, as Śākta Upāya directly they have no relevance in the attainment of Śiva-hood nor are they prohibited, as they do not involve refutation of anything.
viśvātmano hi nāthasya svasminrūpe vikalpito | vidhirniṣedho vā śaktau na svarūpasya khaṇḍane |	b- Being the essence of the entire universe, the Lord has no place within Him for permission and prohibition, as they cannot contradict the positivity of His being either.
paratattvapraveśe tu yameva nikaṭaṃ yadā | upāyaṃ vetti sa grāhyastadā tyājyo'tha vā kvacit |	In regard to the entry into the Transcendental Essence, the aspirant needs to make use of any means at the moment close and available to him or, if need be, it should be rejected sometimes.
na yantraṇātra kāryeti proktaṃ śrītrikaśāsane | samatā sarvadevānāmovallīmantravarṇayoḥ |	It has been observed in the Trika-Sāsana that in this respect one need not bother anyway. -a Equipoise amongst all the gods, facilitation amongst mantras and letters, incontrovertibility amongst the āgamas these are the requisites for oneness with Śiva as all is pervaded by Him.
āgamānāṃ gatīnāṃ ca sarvaṃ śivamayaṃ yataḥ | sa hyakhaṇḍitasadbhāvaṃ śivatattvaṃ prapaśyati |	b-a He who attains the state of integral truth within himself, realises Śiva as the reality of that integral truth.
yo hyakhaṇḍitasadbhāvamātmattvaṃ prapadyate | ketakīkusumasaurabhe bhṛśaṃ bhṛṅga eva rasiko na makṣikā| bhairavīyaparamādvayārcane ko'pi rajyati maheśacoditaḥ | |	b-a Only the hornet can get absorbed in the fragrance of the flower ketaki umbrella tree or screw pine and by no means an ordinary fly. Similarly, only he can be interested in the devotion to the non-dualistic Bhairava who is stimulated by the Great Lord Himself.
asmiṃśca yāge viśrānti kurvatāṃ bhavaḍambara | himānīva mahāgrīṣme svayameva vilīyate | alaṃ vātiprasaṅgena bhūyasātiprapañcite| yogyo'bhinavagupto'sminko'pi yāgavidhau budhaḥ |	The worldly entanglement of those who find interest in this sacrifice melt away in the same way automatically as does the mass of snow on the advent of the fierce summer. Let me stop from going too far into the exposition of the felicity of the devotee of this Lord and the sacrifice related to Him, only some wise Abhinavagupta is capable of performing it successfully.
ityanuttarapadapravikāse śāktamaupayikamadya viviktam|	Thus has been explained today the śākta method of approach meant for the development of the unique state of being.
āṇavena vidhinā paradhāma prepsatāmatha nirūpyata etat |	CHAPTER - C ānava Upāya Hereby is being dealt with the individualistic path to the highest abode for the aspirant of it.
vikalpasyaiva saṃskāre jāte niṣpratiyogini| abhīṣṭe vastuni prāptirniścitā bhogamokṣayoḥ | vikalpaḥ kasyacitsvātmasvātantryādeva susthiraḥ | upāyāntarasāpekṣyaviyogenaiva jāyate |	Attainment of enjoyment and emancipation, as desired by the aspirant, become a certainty on the cultivation of unobtrusive samskāra of the option as distinct from the commonplace worldly. Optional samskāra gets created in someone automatically and becomes fully settled also while in some other one it is born with the aid of some means.
kasyacittu vikalpo'sau svātmasaṃskaraṇaṃ prati | upāyāntarasāpekṣastatroktaḥ pūrvako vidhiḥ |	Sri Tantrāloka In a certain person, the option intended for self-transformation is dependent on some other means to help in the formation of the requisite samskāras.
vikalpo nāma cinmātrasvabhāvo yadyapi sthitaḥ | tathāpi niścayātmāsāvaṇoḥ svātantryayojakaḥ |	Although it is certain that the optional samskāra as well is intimately concerned with consciousness, even then, however, it proves helpful in creating confidence in the self in regard to its autonomy irrespective of its atomicity.
niścayo bahudhā caiṣa tatropāyāśca bhedinaḥ | aṇuśabdena te coktā dūrāntikavibhedataḥ |	Determination comes variously. Variety also multiplies with variation in means. Another factor of variation is the location of the means, i.e. closeness and distance.
tatra buddhau tathā prāṇe dehe cāpi pramātari | apāramārthike'pyasmin paramārtha prakāśate |	There is no doubt about it that intellect, prāņa and body of the aspirant are not ultimate, even then the ultimate becomes reflected in them. Even though prāna, etc.
yataḥ prakāśāccinmātrāt prāṇādyavyatirekavat| tasyaiva tu svatantratvāddvaguṇaṃ jaḍacidvapuḥ |	are not the same as consciousness with its distinguishing feature of luminosity, it is due to its distinctiveness from them lying particularly in its autonomy, that the body is held as of dual nature, i.e. conscient as well as inconscient.
uktaṃ traiśirase caitaddevyai candrārdhamaulinā | jīva śakti śivasyaiva sarvatraiva sthitāpi sā |	Āṇava Upāya Having the half moon on His forehead Śiva has told the Goddess, as has been observed in Traistras Sāstra, that the jiva is, indeed, a force of Śiva Himself remaining spread throughout the world with its ascension to its real form and inclination to get identified with Him through acquisition of the knowledge concerned.
svarūpapratyaye rūḍhā jñānasyonmīlanātparā| tasya cidrūpatāṃ satyāṃ svātantryollāsakalpanāt | paśyañjaḍātmatābhāgaṃ tirodhāyādvayo bhavet | tatra svātantryadṛṣṭyā vā darpaṇe mukhabimbavat |	-a It is owing to the essential conscious form of the jiva, as is obvious from its exercise of autonomy, that when it comes to discriminate its inconscient aspect and separate the same from itself, it comes to the prospect of becoming non- dualistic.b-a Lying in that state of things, when by virtue of exercise of its autonomy, as elucidated by seeing one's face reflected in a mirror, it becomes aware of its essential consciousness, as distinct from the inconscience as had been appearing to it until now.
viśuddhaṃ nijacaitanyaṃ niścinotyatadātmakam | buddhiprāṇadito bhinnaṃ caitanyaṃ niścitaṃ balāt | satyatastadabhinnaṃ syāttasyānyonyavibhedataḥ | viśvarūpāvibheditvaṃ śuddhatvādeva jāyate | niṣṭhitaikasphuranmūrtermūrtyantaravirodhataḥ | antaḥ saṃvidi satsarvaṃ yadyapyaparathā dhiyi |	in view of its essential attribute of consciousness as distinct from theirs inconscience but, at the same time practically it should be non-different from them in view of the actuality of their mutual cooperation. b-a Universality in the manifestation of consciousness is owing to its crystalline purity as distinct from other things being pegged down each to one and the same particular form. b-a In consciousness all is visualised as one with it, though in intellect, prāna and body things, different from them, get somehow reflected.
prāṇe dehe'thavā kasmātsaṃkrāmetkena vā katham | tathāpi nirvikalpe'sminvikalpo nāsti taṃ vinā |	Even then in the state of optionless consciousness, there is no option at all beside the oneness of the individual with the Supreme.
dṛṣṭe'pyadṛṣṭakalpatvaṃ vikalpena tu niścayaḥ | buddhiprāṇaśarīreṣu pāramaiśrvayaṃmañjasā | vikalpyaṃ śūnyarūpe na pramātari vikalpanam | buddhirdhyānamayī tatra prāṇa uccāraṇātmakaḥ |	It is only through the application of the intellectual option that there arises the idea of its distinction from Him. b- a Divinity gets reflected immediately in the intellect, prāņa and body as an optional object of understanding but there is no scope for option in regard to awareness of Him in case of the knower having been nullified. b-a Basicfunction of intellect is meditation while that of prānais activation.
uccāraṇaṃ ca prāṇādyā vyānāntāḥ pañca vṛttayaḥ ādyā tu prāṇanābhikhyāparoccārātmikā bhavet |	Activation is natural to all the five modes of prānas, namely, prāna, apāna, samāna, udāna and vyāna. Out of these five modes of prāna, the first one, i.e. prāna, relates to the act of breathing while the rest to sheer activation.
śarīrasyākṣaviṣayaitatpiṇḍatvena saṃsthitiḥ | tatra dhyānamayaṃ tāvadanuttaramihocyate |	b- Body is the locus of senses and their objects integrated with one another. Meditating intellect is being considered here as the factor of transcendence.
yaḥ prakāśaḥ svatantro'yaṃ citsvabhāvo hṛdi sthitaḥ | sarvatattvamayaḥ proktametacca triśiromate |	Āṇava Upāya The autonomous light of the heart is the original nature of consciousness. It has been characterised in the Trisiras śāstra as the quintessence of all.
kadalīsaṃpuṭākāraṃ sabāhyābhpantarāntaram| īkṣate hṛdayāntaḥsthaṃ tatpuṣpamiva tattvavit |	The knower of the essence visualises within his heart the Reality as a flower of banana within as well as outside.
somasūryāgnisaṃghaṭṭa tatra dhyāyedananyadhīḥ | taddhyānāraṇisaṃkṣobhānmahābhairavahavyabhuk | hṛdayākhye mahākuṇḍe jājvalam sphītatāṃ vrajet | tasya śaktimataḥ sphītaśaktebhairavatejasaḥ |	The aspirant needs to meditate on the conjunction of the moon, the sun and fire. As a result of that meditation standing for the rubbing of the fire sticks, emerges Mahābhairava as the fire in the fire-pit known as heart, burning brilliantly and stimulating the inner being. Then he should contemplate on that flourishing force of Bhairava representing unification of the knower, object of knowledge and the process of knowing.
mātṛmānaprameyākhyaṃ dhāmābhedena bhāvayet | vahvyarkasomaśaktīnāṃ tadeva tritayaṃ bhavet | parā parāparā ceyamaparā ca sadoditā | sṛṣṭisaṃsthitisaṃhāraistāsāṃ pratyekatastridhā | |	-a That unification of the knower, object of knowledge and the process of knowing would represent the triad of the forces of fire, the sun and the moon standing for the transcendent, transcendent-immanent and the immanent which is always manifest. Out of these three, each one acts in a threefold manner, namely, creation, sustenance and dissolution.
caturthaṃ cānavacchinnaṃ rūpamāsāmakalpitam| evaṃ dvādaśa tā devyaḥ sūryabimbavadāsthitāḥ |	b- The fourth unlimited form of them is beyond conceptualisation. Thus, these twelve goddesses stand out as the solar orb. Each one of them shines out in the form of fire, the sun and the moon as also in the peaceful form.
ekaikamāsāṃ vahvyarkasomatacchāntibhāsanam | etadānuttaraṃ cakraṃ hṛdayāccakṣurādibhiḥ |	-a Apart from the heart which is the ground of the realisation of one's Self as the Supreme Being there is a singular cakra which comes to the fore via the senses like the eye, etc.
vyomabhirniḥsaratyeva tattadviṣayagocare | taccakramābhistatrārthe sṛṣṭisthitilayakramāt | somasūryāgnibhāsātma rūpaṃ samavatiṣṭhate | evaṃ śabdādiviṣaye śrotrādivyomavartmanā | |	a-a Acting in the light of the same cakra in the processes of creation, sustenance and dissolution the Self behaves as the moon, the sun and fire. b-a Similar is the case with other senses such as that of hearing which, too, moves out through the ears and acting through the cakra concerned is used to find the identity of its objects in the world outside.
cakreṇānena patatā tādātmyaṃ paribhāvayet | anena kramayogena yatra yatra patatyadaḥ | cakraṃ sarvātmakaṃ tattatsārvabhaumamahīśavat | itthaṃ viśvādhvapaṭalamayatnenaiva līyate | bhairavīyamahācakre saṃvittiparivārite| tataḥ saṃskāramātreṇa viśvasyāpi parikṣaye |	Thus proceeding via this cakra the aspirant needs to visualise his oneness with all whatever. b-a In this way whatever object the aspirant attends to via this singular cakra, realises his oneness with it like a sovereign king moving in his empire b-a ānava Upāya Through practice of meditation in this way on the path of the world, the latter gets dissolved effortlessly in the great cakra of Bhairava as surrounded by consciousness. b-a Thus getting the world dissolved even in the form of impression, samskāra, the aspirant should concentrate on the central great cakra taking round within himself.
svātmocchalattayā bhrāmyaccakraṃ saṃcintayenmahat | tatastaddāhyavilayāt tassaṃskāraparikṣayāt | praśāmyadbhāvayeccakraṃ tataḥ śāntaṃ tataḥ śamam|	b-a Getting the external world burnt down in the fire of consciousness not only in its actual grossness but also in its form of impression, the aspirant needs to meditate on sheer peace itself and thus attain peace within himself.
anena dhyānayogena viśvaṃ cakre vilīyate |	b-a By virtue of the practice of this yoga of meditation the world in its actuality gets merged into the cakra of the psyche rendering the psyche itself shorn of its object.
tatsaṃvidi tataḥ saṃvidvilīnārthaiva bhāsate| citsvābhāvyāt tato bhūyaḥ sṛṣṭiryaccinmaheśvarī |	b-a Objectification being the innate nature of consciousness, she as the mistress of the Lord manifests another creation in Her awareness each moment and dissolves the same in the next.
evaṃ triśūlāt prabhṛti catuṣpañcārakakramāt| pañcāśadaraparyantaṃ cakraṃ yogī vibhāvayet | catuṣṣaṣṭiśatāraṃ vā sahasrāramayāpi vā| asaṃkhyārasahasraṃ vā cakraṃ dhyāyedananyadhīḥ |	As a result of this act of the goddess, the aspirant is likely to attain the state of Bhairava-hood. b- The yogin needs to contemplate exclusively on cakras beginning from three- petalled to four, five, fifty, sixty-four, thousand-petalled, and even one having infinite number of petals.
saṃvinnāthasya mahato devasyollāsisaṃvidaḥ | naivāsti kācitkalanā viśvaśaktermaheśituḥ |	- Indeed, incalculable are the channels of manifestation of the forces of the great Lord, the Lord of the universal force, of consciousness when He becomes inclined to manifest them.
śaktayo'sya jagat kṛtsnaṃ śaktimāṃstu maheśvaraḥ | iti māṅgalaśāstre tu śrīśrīkaṣṭho nyarūpayat | |	In fact, the entire universe is the manifest form of His forces while He is the Lord of it. This has been elucidated in the Māngala Sāstra by Srikantha.
ityetat prathamopāyarūpaṃ dhyānaṃ nyarūpayat| śrīśaṃbhunātho me tuṣṭastasmai śrīsumatiprabhuḥ |	This initial device of meditation was revealed to me by śambhunātha while the same to him by Sumatiprabhu.
anayaiva diśānyāni dhyānānyapi samāśrayet | anuttaropāyadhurāṃ yānyāyānti kramaṃ binā | |	Moving in this direction, one needs to take recourse to other devices of meditation leading ultimately to the highest one. There is no restriction of order among them.
atha prāṇasya yā vṛttiḥ prāṇanādyā nirūpitā | tadupāyatayā brūmo'nuttarapravikāsanam |	Āṇava Upāya As regards the function of prāna, that has already been elaborated on in the form of breathing, etc. Concerning further development on that line, now I propose to write on how to develop uniqueness.
nijānande pramātraṃśamātre hṛdi purā sthitaḥ | śūnyatāmātraviśrānternirānandaṃ vibhāvayet |	Beginning with attention on the personal care of delight lying within oneself as the knower, primarily in the heart, the aspirant needs to contemplate on the state of absence of delight for attaining the state of peaceful rest in total absence of everything.
prāṇodaye prameye tu parānandaṃ vibhāvayet | tatrānantaprameyāṃśapūraṇāpānanirvṛtaḥ |	On the ascendancy of the object of knowledge along with that of the prāna, he needs to meditate on parānanda. Due to fulfilment of the object of knowledge here on this point, the apāna gets stopped.
parānandagatastiṣṭhedapānaśaśiśobhitaḥ | tato'nantasphuranmeyasaṃghaṭṭaikāntanirvṛtaḥ |	Taking his stand in the state of impersonal delight, he becomes illuminated with the lunar light; then he retires to the cumulative standpoint of the objects of knowledge.
samānabhūmimāgatya brahmānandamayo bhavet | tato'pi mānameyaughakalanāgrāsatatparaḥ |	Having attained the state of samāna, the aspirant has the possibility of becoming filled with the delight of Brahman.
udānavahnau viśrānto mahānandaṃ vibhāvayet | tatra viśrāntimabhyetya śāmyatyasminmahārciṣi |	Having attained the state of rest in the fire of the prāna known as udāna, the aspirant needs to contemplate on the great delight,mahānanda. By virtue of taking rest in this state, he finds solace in the great conflagration of consciousness.
nirūpādhirmahāvyāptirvyānākhyopādhivarjitā | tadā khalu cidānando yo jaḍānupavṛṃhitaḥ |	Here the aspirant has the experience of the delight of consciousness absolutely free of inconscience. The state of delight of consciousness, cidānanda, is absolutely free from inconscience.
nātra saṃsthitiḥ kāpi vibhaktā jaḍarūpiṇaḥ| yatra ko'pi vyavacchedo nāsti yadviśvataḥ sphurat |	Here there is no limitation of anything whatsoever which might manifest itself universally. The state of jagadānanda, is one of absolutely unaffected consciousness.
yadanāhatasaṃvitti paramāmṛtavṛṃhitam | yatrāsti bhāvanādīnāṃ na mukhyā kāpi saṃgatiḥ |	It expounds into supreme immortality. Here there is no relevance of any kind of ideation, etc.
tadeva jagadānandamasmabhyaṃ śaṃbhurūcivān | tatra viśrāntirādheyā hṛdayoccārayogataḥ | yā tatra samyagviśrānti sānuttaramayī sthitiḥ | ityetadhṛdayādyekasvabhāve'pi svadhāmani |	The aspirant needs to rest himself via the yoga of mobilisation of the heart as per the same device. Āṇava Upāya The aspirant's perfect rest in that state is the highest. Although there is unanimity of heart, etc., on account of kindredness of function at that point which is one's own abode, it is taken to be the point where is involved movement of the six prāṇas as is obvious from their expansion.
ṣaṭprāṇoccārajaṃ rūpamatha vyāptyā taducyate | prāṇadaṇḍaprayogena pūrvāparasamīkṛteḥ |	-a Here through the application of what is known as the device of prāna danda, death, the aspirant should manage to bring equivalence between the prior and the latter and thus take resort to the house of four-petalled lotus.
catuṣkikāmbujālambilambikāsaudhamāśrayet | triśūlabhūmiṃ krāntvāto nāḍitritayasaṅgatām | | icchājñānakriyāśaktisamatve praviśet sudhīḥ |	Having crossed the point of trident where the three nerves, namely, idā, pingalā and susumnā meet together, the wise man should enter into the state of equivalence among the forces of willing, knowing and doing. b-a Then he should take resort to the series of steps leading from the middle of the eyebrows up to the point of end of sound, nādānta, which is redeemed of contraction and is expanding and fully blooming.
śrayetbhrūbindunādāntaśaktisopānamālikām | tatrordhvakuṇḍalībhūmau spandanodarasundaraḥ |	b-a That is the land of the upper kundalini which keeps constantly vibrating. The aspirant should take resort to it looking like the expanding and contracting belly of fish taken out of water.
visargastatra viśrāmyenmatsyodaradaśājuṣi | rāsabhī vaḍavā yadvatsvadhāmānandamandiram | vikāsasaṃkocamayaṃ praviśya hṛdi hṛṣyati | tadvanmuhurlīnasṛṣṭabhāvavrātasunirbharām |	b-a As a jennet or mare feels delighted by the act of contraction and expansion of anus, even so having participated in the act of creation and dissolution which is going on constantly, the aspirant, as it were, participates in the conjugal act of Bhairava and Bhairavi in the process of creation and dissolution. b-a Then comes the stage of sarvāpūrana yoga, all-fulfilling yoga. It is resting in the highest being itself.
śrayedvikāsasaṃkocarūḍhabhairavayāmalām | ekīkṛtamahāmūlaśūlavaisargike hṛdi |	It is brought in through unification of mahāmula and śūla in the heart along with the sense of liberation.
parasminneti viśrānti sarvāpūraṇayogataḥ | atra tatpūrṇavṛttyaiva viśvāveśamayaṃ sthitam | prakāśasyātmaviśrāntāvahamityeva dṛśyatām | anuttaravimarśe prāgvyāpārādivivarjite |	b-a In this state of ūrdhva kundalini, the aspirant experiences himself as filled with universal impetus owing to fulfilment of all his inclinations. The illumination comes to rest within itself and only the I-ness of the aspirant remains in the sight. b-a In this state of the highest contemplation, where there is complete absence of prior contemplations, there emerges contemplation of ‘I’ out of the sense of pure consciousness in its first instance of manifestation.
cidvimarśaparāhaṃkṛt prathamollāsinī sphuret | tata udyogasaktena sa dvādaśakalātmanā | sūryeṇābhāsayedbhāvaṃ pūrayedatha carcayet | athenduḥ ṣoḍaśakalo visargagrāsamantharaḥ |	b-a ānava Upāya Then the Sun of the Self along with all His twelve fractions needs to get activated and fill the universe and pervade all by Himself. b-a Now the Moon along with all Her sixteen fractions slow in swallowing the manifestation should emit Her enlivening nectar in the fire of consciousness. The forces of willing, knowing and doing would serve as subtle holes in the fore-front of the ladle.
saṃjīvanyamṛtaṃ bodhavahnau visṛjati sphuran icchājñānakriyāśaktisūkṣmarandhrasrugagragam |	b-a NOTE: This symbolic account relates to the innate constitutional system of living beings with their senses as holes of the ladle of consciousness through which the nectar of delight is getting slowly poured down into the fire of self-awareness and sustains interest in life.
tadevam tada mṛtaṃ divyaṃ saṃvidevīṣu tarpakam | visargāmṛtametāvad bodhākhye hutabhojina | visṛṣṭaṃ cedbhavetsarvaṃ hutaṃ ṣoḍhādhvamaṇḍalam | yato'nuttaranāthasya visargaḥ kulanāyikā | tatkṣobhaḥ kādihāntaṃ tatprasarastattvapaddhatiḥ |	If these slow droplets of nectar were to get dropped into the fire of consciousness in their fullness, the entire circle of six paths would get flooded with the offering in the sacrificial fire of life. b-a The Supreme Goddess is the heroine of the drama of the world represented by Herself in the form of the creation. Agitation in Herself has assumed the form of the sounds beginning from k to h and the same series of sounds getting materialised has assumed the form of the tangible world.
aṃa iti kuleśvaryā sahito hi kuleśitā | paro visargaviśleṣastanmayaṃ viśvamucyate |	b Sri Tantrāloka The sounds am and ah, represent the integration of the goddess of the universe with the rulership of it. The liberated sound visarga, i.e. ah, is representative of the universe.
vitprāṇaguṇadehāntarbahirdravyamayīmimām| arcayejjuhuyāddhyāyeditthaṃ saṃjīvanīṃ kalām | ānandanāḍīyugalaspandanāvahitau sthitaḥ | enāṃ visarganiṣyandasaudhabhūmiṃ prapadyate |	While consciousness and prāna and the internal means guna and body are the external objects of worship with the use of which the aspirant needs to pay homage to, make offering of and meditate on the fraction of vitality of the Divine. By virtue of meditation on the agitation of both the nerves of delight passing via the thousand-petalled lotus, the aspirant attains the nectarial emission oozing out of the lotus.
śākte kṣobhe kulāveśe sarvanāḍyagragocare| vyāptau sarvātmasaṃkoce hṛdayaṃ praviśetsudhīḥ |	The wise aspirant should enter into the heart in the state of agitation of the Force, impetuosity of the inner being and absorption within and enjoy within altogether in an integrated form which otherwise is getting manifested through all the nerves with their openings in the form of senses.
somasūryakalājālaparasparanigharṣataḥ| agnīṣomātmake dhāmni visargānanda unmiṣet |	The aspirant needs to make manifest the delight of emission born of interaction between fractions of the moon and the sun and overflowing one's personality formed of fire and Soma.
alaṃ rahasyakathayā guptametatsvabhāvataḥ | yoginīhṛdayaṃ tatra viśrāntaḥ syātkṛtī budhīḥ | |	The fortunate and wise aspirant needs to take rest in the heart of the yoginī as it is suggestive of renunciation from the gross, as it is partial and delusive.
hānādānatiraskāravṛttau rūḍhimupāgataḥ | abhedavṛttitaḥ paśyedviśvaṃ citicamatkṛteḥ |	He needs to stay in the state of mind shorn of the consideration of rejection and acceptance both and view the world with equivalence between the two as an astonishing spectacle of consciousness.
arthakriyārthitādainyaṃ tyaktvā bāhyāntarātmani | svarūpe nirvṛtiṃ prāpya phullāṃ nādadaśāṃ śrayet | vaktramantastayā samyak saṃvidaḥ pravikāsayet | saṃvidakṣamaruccakraṃ jñeyābhinnaṃ tato bhavet |	Having relinquished the meanness of selfishness for objects internally as well as externally, the aspirant should attain disinterestedness and take resort to the fully blooming state of sound, that is, the state of ‘I am that', so'ham. As a result of blooming of the transcendent consciousness inwardly, the circle of outward awareness, senses, and prāna get merged into the object of understanding.
tajjñeyaṃ saṃvidākhyena vahninā pravilīyate | vilīnaṃ tat trikoṇe'smiñśaktivahnau vilīyate |	Then the object of understanding also gets consumed in the fire of the force of consciousness in its triangular form of desire, awareness and action.
tatra saṃvedanodārabindusattāsunirvṛtaḥ| saṃhārabījaviśrānto yogī paramayo bhavet |	Having become absorbed completely into the sole awareness of the lofty point, bindu, the aspirant comes to rest in the summation of all and becomes one with the Transcendent.
antarbāhye dvaye vāpi sāmānyetarasundaraḥ| saṃvitspandastriśaktyātmā saṃkocapravikāsavān |	There is vibration of consciousness in all its triad aspects, i.e. willing, knowing and acting and the aspirant becomes the Lord of them in regard to both contraction as well as expansion.
asaṃkocavikāso'pi tadābhāsanatastathā | antarlakṣyo bahirdṛṣṭiḥ paramaṃ padamaśnute |	Indeed, there is neither contraction nor expansion in consciousness except for its sheer appearance as such on account of the human limitations . As a matter of fact, the aspirant himself becomes turned inward in his vision along with the appearance of seeing outward and thus attaining the state of the Supreme Being.
tataḥ svātantryanirmeye vicitrārthakriyākṛti | vimarśanaṃ viśeṣākhyaḥ spanda aunmukhyasaṃjñitaḥ | tatra viśrāntimāgacchedyadvīryaṃ mantramaṇḍale | śāntyādisiddhayastattadrūpatādātmyato yataḥ |	Therefore, creation being the result of the force of autonomy, the output is full of the peculiarity of objects and events known as special contemplation, spanda, vibration and inclination. The aspirant needs to take repose in this special contemplation which serves as the source of virility in the circle of mantra. This is due to the fact that ānava Upāya accomplishments like peace, sānti, emerge in those forms owing to the aspirant's identification of himself in respective forms.
divyo yaścakṣāsaṃgho'yaṃ bodhasvātantryasaṃjñakaḥ | so'nimīlita evaitat kuryātsvātmamayaṃ jagat |	As a result of the aspirant's taking repose in this contemplation the group of his organs of sense and action both as the autonomous instrument of understanding becomes divinised and has the possibility of transforming the world in its own way although remaining open in their own ways.
mahāsāhasasaṃyogavilīnākhilavṛttikāḥ | puñjībhūte svaraśmyoghe nirbharobhūya tiṣṭhati |	Displaying the immensity of his courage of deep contemplation the aspirant merges all his tendencies into the vibration of consciousness and sits self- confident in the centre of the multitude of rays of consciousness spreading around him without any ideation on his part.
akiṃciccintakastatra spaṣṭadṛgyāti saṃvidam | yadvisphuliṅgāḥ saṃsārabhasmadāhaikahetavaḥ |	Instead of ideation, he perceives things as sheer consciousness, the sparks of which are in themselves capable of consuming the worldly sense.
taduktaṃ parameśena triśirobhairavāgame | śṛṇu devi pravakṣyāmi mantrabhūmyāṃ praveśanam |	- The Supreme Lord has observed in the Trisiras Bhairava āgama: “O Goddess, listen to me, how to enter into the plane of mantra ?" “How to rise upward along the middle one of the threc nerves, this is the characteristic feature of attainment of righteousness.
madhyanāḍyordhvagamanaṃ taddharmaprāptilakṣaṇam | visargāntapadātītaṃ prāntakoṭinirūpitam |	This is the state of transcendence lying above the creation of the diversity.” This is made possible by restraint downward as well as springing upward.
adhapravāhasaṃrodhādūrdhvakṣepavivarjanāt mahāprakāśamudayajñānavyaktipradāyakam anubhūya pare dhāmni mātrāvṛttyā puraṃ viśet | nistaraṅgāvatīrṇā sā vṛttirekā śivātmikā |	It creates the opportunity for manifestation of knowledge of the great Light. Having visualised the Light, the aspirant needs to enter into the highest abode cognitively. This mode of cognition is non-vibrating and amounts to realisation of Siva Himself.
catuṣṣaḍvirdviguṇitacakraṣaṭkasamujjvalā | tatsthaṃ tstho vicārayet khaṃ khaṃ khasthaṃ khasthena saṃviśet |	In the illumination of this inward path there is involvement of cakras having four, eight, sixteen, six, twelve and twenty-four petals.
khaṃ khaṃ tyaktvā khamārūya khasthaṃ khaṃ coccarediti | khamadhyāsyādhikāreṇa padasthāścinmarīcayaḥ | bhāvayedbhāvamantaḥsthaṃ bhāvastho bhāvaniḥspṛhaḥ | bhāvābhāvagatī ruddhvā bhāvābhāvāvarodhadṛk |	Remaining in the state of realisation of all this, the aspirant needs to contemplate on the vacuum alone having vacated his inner being of all its prior content. By means of the vacuum of the inner being, he needs to ascend to the state of vacuum and move in that state of void of selflessness which, indeed, is the state of extreme contraction of the Self going down to the sub-atomic extremity, so to say, where all the rays of understandings get restored to their very source.
ātmāṇukulamūlāni śaktirbhūtiścitī ratiḥ | śaktitrayaṃ draṣṭṛdṛśyoparaktaṃ tadvivarjitam | | etatkhaṃ daśadhā proktamuccāroccāralakṣaṇam | dhāmasthaṃ dhāmamadhyasthaṃ dhāmodarapuṭīkṛtam | dhāmnā tu bodhayeddhāma dhāma dhāmāntagaṃ kuru| taddhāma dhāmagatyā tu bhedyaṃ dhāmāntamāntaram |	Āṇava Upāya The monosyllabic sound kha means as many as ten things which are as under: ātman, aṇu, kula-mūla, śakti, bhūti, citi, rati and the three forces of willing, knowing and doing. These ten forms of kha characterised by ascension step by step from within the luminous abode, to the middle of it as well as contracted in its belly. Through contemplation on these ten points of splendour the aspirant attains the highest consciousness. The aspirant needs to awaken the centre of splendour by means of splendour of the life-force, try to reach the end of attachment and get unveiled the hidden secrets of pure consciousness.
bhedopabhedabhedena bhedaḥ kāryastu madhyataḥ | iti praveśopāyo'yamāṇavaḥ parikīrtitaḥ |	He should go inside himself and get revealed the secrets within secrets one after the other. This is how has been explained the mode of entry into one's being which is extremely atomic but abounds in mysteries.
śrīmaheśvaranāthena yo hṛtsthena mamoditaḥ | śrībrahmayāmale coktaṃ śrīmān rāvo daśātmakaḥ | sthūlaḥ sūkṣmaḥ paro hṛdyaḥ kaṇṭhyastālavya eva ca| sarvataśca vibhuryo'sau vibhutvapadadāyakaḥ |	What has been communicated to me by Lord Śiva who is lying seated in my heart, the same has been said in the Brahmayāmala Tantra as ten kinds of sound, namely, gross, subtle, transcendent, produced from the heart, from the throat, from the palate, as it is all-prevailing and therefore is capable of giving access to one and all. - He is an accomplished yogin who has got control over sound.
jitarāvo mahāyogī saṃkrāmetparadehagaḥ | parāṃ ca vindati vyāptiṃ pratyahaṃ hyabhyaseta tam |	He attains extraordinary pervasiveness, if he practises it regularly until the agent of sound merges into the state of soundlessness.
tāvadyāvadarāve sā rāvāllīyeta rāviṇī | atra bhāvanayā dehagatopāyaiḥ pare pathi |	The traveller of the supernal path through contemplation on his own bodily devices arrives at the state of delight before intending to enter into the state of perfection.
vivikṣoḥ pūrṇatāsparśātprāgānandaḥ prajāyate | tato'pi vidyudāpātasadṛśe dehavarjite | | dhāmni kṣaṇaṃ samāveśādudbhavaḥ prasphuṭaṃ plutiḥ | jalapāṃsuvadabhyastasaṃviddehaikyahānitaḥ | |	Then appears before him without any source whatsoever something like a flash of lightning. Owing to absorption in that illumination for a while he gets an obvious jump. As a result of this jump, the aspirant feels as if his physical body has been washed away like the layer of dust with the consequence of removal of the delusion of oneness between the body and consciousness.
svabalākramaṇāddehaśaithilyāt kampamāpnuyāt | galite dehatādātmyaniścaye'ntarmukhatvataḥ | nidrāyate purā yāvanna rūḍhaḥ saṃvidātmani | tataḥ satyapade rūḍho viśvātmatvena saṃvidam |	Due to weakening of self-confidence the aspirant is likely to experience some sort of trembling at this stage. With the elimination of the delusion of identity between the body and the consciousness, he becomes introverted and prior to ascension to the pedestal of consciousness he is very much likely to feel sleepy. Following the sleepiness, he finds himself having ascended the pedestal of truth and realises consciousness as the essence of the universe.
saṃvidan ghūrṇirmahāvyāptiryataḥ smṛtā | ātmanyanātmābhimatau satyāmeva hyanātmani | ātmābhimāno dehādau bandho muktistu tallayaḥ | ādāvanātmanyātmatve līne labdhe nijātmani | ātmanyanātmatānāśe mahāvyāptiḥ pravartate| ānanda udbhavaḥ kampo nidrā ghūrṇiśca pañcakam |	-a ānava Upāya Mistaking the not-self as self and conversely the self as not-self results in the imputation of self-hood to the body, etc., resulting in bondage while correction of the same wrong notion is emancipation. b-a The aspirant attains the state of all-pervasiveness by taking two steps beginning with recovery of the Self merged earlier in the not-self followed by disappearance of the not-self in the force of the Self. -a Prior to attainment of all-pervasiveness, the aspirant has the experience of delight, rising upward, tremor, sleepiness and rolling.
ityuktamata eva śrīmālinīvijayottare |	This has been made out in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra.
pradarśite'sminnānandaprabhṛtau pañcake yadā | yogī viśettadā tattaccakreśatvaṃ haṭhāt vrajet | yathā sarveśinā bodhenākrāntāpi tanuḥ kvacit |	b-a Following the manifestation of these five features, the yogin needs to have the sense of mastery over the cakra concerned. b-a Although the body has the potentiality of acquiring all sorts of powers, yet powers manifest in it gradually and with limitations on them.
kiṃcitkartuṃ prabhavati cakṣuṣā rūpasaṃvidam| tathaiva cakre kutrāpi praveśātko'pi saṃbhavet |	As, for instance, is the case of the eye which can have the sense of vision. Even so by virtue of mastery over anyone of the cakras, the practitioner may get manifested anyone of the powers.
ānandacakraṃ vahnyaśri kanda udbhava ucyate| kampo hṛttālu nidrā ca ghūrṇiḥ syādūrdhvakuṇḍalī | |	Kanda, the particular knot of nerves is the point of its origin. Tremor occurs in the heart and the palate. Sleepiness and sense of moving round are the effects of awakening of the higher kundalini.
etacca sphuṭamevoktaṃ śrīmattraiśirase mate | evaṃ pradarśitoccāraviśrāntihṛdayaṃ |	In Traisiras Mata, this has clearly been stated. Thus has been shown the state of the heart attaining rest following agitation in it.
yattadavyaktaliṅgaṃ nṛśivaśaktyavibhāgavat | atra viśvamidaṃ līnamatrāntaḥ sthaṃ ca gamyate |	This is characterised as the state of avyakta linga, the state in which indications are unmanifest since here the human and Saivite features are intermixed. -a Here the world disappears in the I-sense and seems to be encompassed in this sense with the possibility of being recovered from it.
idaṃ tallakṣaṇaṃ pūrṇaśaktibhairavasaṃvidaḥ | dehagādhvasamunmeṣe samāveśastu yaḥ sphuṭaḥ | ahantācchāditonmeṣibhāvedaṃbhāvayuk sa ca | vyaktāvyaktamidaṃ liṅga mantravīryaṃ parāparam |	This is the special feature of the perfect Sakti-Bhairava consciousness. b-a On the arousal of the sense of Self in the body, etc., the aspirant's absorption in it becomes obvious but is superimposed by the sense of ‘I’. This state of experience is characterised as one of the manifest and unmanifest, vyakta-avyakta, partly disclosed and partly closed, where the power of mantra gains primacy and at the same time remains subordinate.
naraśattisamunmeṣi śivarūpādvibheditam | yannayakkṛtaśivāhantāsamāveśaṃ vibhedavat |	Here the human aspect of the view of the reality, as distinct from that of Siva, becomes manifest.
viśeṣaspandarūpaṃ tad vyakta liṅga cidātmakam | vyaktātsiddhiprasavo vyaktāvyaktādvayaṃ vimokṣaśca| avyaktādbalamādyaṃ parasya nānuttare tviyaṃ carcā | ātmākhyaṃ yad vyaktaṃ naraliṅgaṃ tatra viśvamarpayataḥ| vyaktāvyaktaṃ tasmādgalite yasmiṃstadavyaktam |	b-a Devotion to the manifest form of the Supreme Being forms the source of extraordinary powers, siddhi, while that to the unmanifest form leads to liberation as well. In fact, all kinds of attainment emerge from the unmanifest except for needlessness of mention of it in the transcendent state. As a matter of fact, devotion to the manifest form of the Supreme Being is characterised by the surrender of the individual's angle along with that of the world to Him while the unmanifest form is absolutely of this angle too. In the case of evaporation of the manifest and unmanifest both, what remains at last is only the unmanifest.
tenātmaliṅgametat parame śivaśaktyaṇusvabhāvamaye | avyakte viśrāmyati nānuttaradhāmagā tviyaṃ carcā |	Thus, the sense of Selfhood, characterised as the manifest form of devotion, merges into the integral view of the reality as a complex of Śiva, Sakti and the ātman, which is the state of the umanifest. This deliberation, however, cannot be extended further to the Transcendent.
ekasya spandanasyaiṣā traidhaṃ bhedavyavasthitiḥ | atra liṅge sadā tiṣṭhet pūjāviśrāntitatparaḥ |	Indeed, there is only throb which gets diversified into three in course of emergence of the notion of the universal and the individual . As such, one needs to remain constantly devoted to that integral Reality of oneness.
yoginīhṛdayaṃ liṅgamidamānandasundaram | bījayonisamāpattyā sūte kāmapi saṃvidam |	This emblem of the integral state of the Reality is known as yogini hrdaya, heart of the yogini. It is delightful as well as beautiful. Due to association of the seed with the womb, it gives birth to the peculiar consciousness.
atra prayāsavirahātsarvo'sau devatāgaṇaḥ | ānandapūrṇa dhāmnyāste nityoditacidātmakaḥ |	The entire galaxy of gods dwells here in this abode of delight effortlessly in the state of pre-eminence of the eternal consciousness.
atra bhairavanāthasya sasaṃkocavikāsikā | bhāsate durghaṭā śaktirasaṃkocavikāsinaḥ |	Herein is reflected the wonderful Force of Bhairavanātha which is responsible for expansion and contraction both while He Himself remains immune to contraction as well as expansion.
etalliṅgasamāpattirvisargānandadhārayā | siktaṃ tadeva sadviśvaṃ śaśvannavanavāyate |	If the transcendent device as well has happened to be deliberated here in the context of the individual approach to the Reality that is due to essential ānava Upāya sameness between the two.
anuttaro'pyupāyo'tra tādrūpyādeva varṇitaḥ | jvaliteṣvapi dīpeṣu dharmāśuḥ kiṃ na bhāsate | artheṣu tadbhogavidhau tadutthe duḥkhaṃ sukhe vā galitābhiśaṅkam | anāviśanto'pi nimagnacittā jānanti vṛttikṣayasaukhyamantaḥ |	May the sun not shine while lamps remain lighted! Aspirants of the delight of the supernal essence happen to find themselves occasionally absorbed in things commonplace as also in the enjoyment of them no matter the same be pleasant or unpleasant unsuspectingly even without getting entry into the secret of them in spite of having understanding of the delight accruing out of control over the curvatures of consciousness.
satyevātmani citsvabhāvamahasi svānte tathopakriyāṃ tasmai kurvanti tatpracāravivaśe satyakṣavarge'pi ca | satsvartheṣu sukhādiṣu sphuṭataraṃ yadbhedavandhyodayaṃ yogī tiṣṭhati pūrṇaraśmivibhavastattattvamācīyatām |	In spite of luminosity being the very nature of the Self, the team of the senses does favour to it by way of mobilising it in its own ways. Notwithstanding the obvious availability of occasions of experience of pleasure, etc. the yogin having neutralised all ideas of difference remains steadfast in his full illumination of consciousness and delight. The same principle of consciousness and delight forming the mainstay of the yogin needs to be taken resort to by the aspirant.
ityuccāravidhiḥ proktaḥ karaṇaṃ pravivicyate | tacvetthaṃ triśiraḥ śāstre parameśena bhāṣitam | grāhyagrāhakacidvyāptityāgākṣepaniveśanaiḥ | karaṇaṃ saptadhā prāhurabhyāsaṃ bodhapūrvakam | |	Thus has been recounted the way how to sublimate the inner being. Now are going to be explained the means through the application of which this objective is to be hit at. This has been talked about by the Supreme Lord Himself in the Trisiras Sāstra as follows: The object to be grasped, the agent of grasping, consciousness, pervasion, renunciation, throwing around and investment, these are the seven factors and devices to be employed to fulfil the task.
tadvyāptipūrvamākṣepe karaṇaṃ svapratiṣṭhatā| guruvaktrācca boddhavyaṃ karaṇaṃ yadyapi sphuṭam |	All this is to be done with full application of awareness Aksepa, throwing around, as a means to achieving the state of psychic sublimation is to remain constantly steadfast within one's being in the midst of renunciation of everything belonging to oneself. Clear understanding about karana, means of psychic sublimation, needs to be got from the mouth of one's teacher.
tathāpyāgamarakṣārthaṃ tada varṇaṣyite | ukto ya eva uccārastatra yo'sau saphuran sthitaḥ | avyaktānukṛtiprāyo dhvanirvarṇaḥ sa kathyate | sṛṣṭisaṃhārabījaṃ ca tasya mukhyaṃ vapurviduḥ |	For the sake of preservation of the tradition in this regard, however, details about it would be presented ahead of it. -a a What is known as uccāra, pronunciation, is the presence of a throb in the form of an umanifest imitation and is also called sound and letter. Its main body is the seed of the dissolution of the creation.
tadabhyāsavaśādyāti kramādyogī cidātmatām | tathā hyanacke sācke vā kādau sānte punaḥ punaḥ | smṛte proccārite vāpi sā sā saṃvitprasūyate | bāhyārthasamayāpekṣā ghaṭādyā dhvanayo'pi ye |	b-a By simply remembering or pronouncing the consonant sounds beginning in the alphabet with k and ending with s with the vowel or even without the vowel, one gets the related consciousness generated within oneself. b-a ānava Upāya Even sounds denotative of external objects, time, etc., such as pitcher, etc., produce the corresponding ideas within oneself like wilful beings.
iti bhairavaśabdasya saṃtatoccāraṇācchivaḥ | śrīmattraiśirase'pyuktaṃ mantroddhārasya pūrvataḥ | |	b-a It has been observed in Trisiras śāstra by the Supreme Lord Śiva Himself that as Bhairava pervades the entire world much earlier than the formation of the mantra concerning Him, continuous utterance of His name result in the realisation of Śiva.
smṛtiśca smaraṇaṃ pūrvaṃ sarvabhāveṣu vastutaḥ | mantrasvarūpaṃ tadbhāvyasvarūpāpattiyojakam | smṛtiḥ svarūpajanikā sarvabhāveṣu rañjikā | anekākārarūpeṇa sarvatrāvasthitena tu | |	b- Memory, indeed, is the capability to remember all kinds of objects which might have had the occasion to get flashed in the psyche. This capacity seems to have been there in the psyche since a date earlier than the emergence of objects gets reflected on the canvas of mind. This is why the remembrance of the word happens to associate itself with the object concerned. Memory is the producer of form.
svasvabhāvasya saṃprāptiḥ savittiḥ paramārthataḥ| vyaktiniṣṭhā tato viddhi sattā sā kīrtitā parā |	It is the state of attainment of one's own being existing everywhere in different forms. Although its locus is the individual, it is understandably a higher kind of existence.
kiṃ punaḥ samayāpekṣāṃ vinā ye bījapiṇḍakā | saṃvidaṃ spandayantyete neyuḥ saṃvidupāyatām |	- The seed mantras are independent of the efficacy of time on them. They represent the throb of consciousness and hence are amenable to be utilised as a device in the realisation of consciousness.
vācyābhāvādudāsīnasaṃvitspandātsvadhāmataḥ | prāṇollāsanirodhābhyāṃ bījapiṇḍeṣu pūrṇatā | sukhasītkārasatsamyaksāmyaprathamasaṃvidaḥ | savedanaṃ hi prathamaṃ sparśo'nuttarasaṃvidaḥ |	Due to absence of any literal meaning in them and indifference of them in regard to consciousness emerging from them, but owing to their tending to objects and tendency of introversion, there is fullness in these seed mantras. Owing to the experience of the pleasure of utterance of the sound s and harmonisation of consciousness through the utterance of it and contact with the primeval consciousness through it the seed sounds arouses the higher consciousness in the inner being of the aspirant.
hṛtkaṇṭhyoṣṭhyatridhāmāntarnitarāṃ prāvikasini | caturdaśa praveśo ya ekīkṛtatadātmakaḥ | |	The same sound getting further associated with triad of abodes, that is, heart, throat and lips, etc.
tato visargoccārāṃśe dvādaśāntapayāvubhau | hṛdayena sahakadhyaṃ nayate japatatparaḥ |	Following all this, while coming to pronounce the sound known as visarga, the aspirant reaches the state of dvādaśānta, and utters it is in association with the heart.
kandahṛtkaṇṭhatālvagrakauṇḍilīprakiyāntataḥ | ānandamadhyanāḍyantaḥ spandanaṃ bījamāvahet | |	- Starting from kanda, complex of nerves at the base and rising along the heart, throat, palate and the kundalinī the aspirant should pass via the central nerve, ānava Upāya susumnā and carry the throb of the seed sounds to the supramental state.
saṃhārabījaṃ khaṃ hṛtsthamoṣṭhyaṃ phullaṃ svamūrdhani | tejastryaśraṃ tālukaṇṭhe binburūrdhvapade sthitaḥ |	Kham is the seed mantra of samhāra, dissolution. Its abode is the heart. Arising from the heart, it passes via lips and comes to bloom fully in the head. It is of the nature of fire. It is triangular and its triad of points is located in the palate, throat and head.
ityenayā budho yuktyā varṇajapyaparāyaṇaḥ | anuttaraṃ paraṃ dhāma praviśedacirāt sudhīḥ | |	Proceeding on these lines the wise aspirant repeating silently the seed sound has the probability of entering in a short time into the abode of excellence.
varṇaśabdena nīlādi yadvā dīkṣottare yathā | saṃhārannagnimaruto rūdrabinduyutānsmaret |	or as directed by his teacher following his initation putting together ks, m,r and y as associated with the sound u and the point, bindu.
hṛdaye tanmayo lakṣyaṃ paśyetsaptadinādatha | visphuliṅgāgnivannīlapītaraktādicitritam | jājvalīti hṛdambhoje bījadīpaprabodhitam | dīpavajjvalito vindurbhāsate vidhanākaivat |	He should meditate on the heart getting one with it for more than seven days resulting in perception of sparks, and emblem as luminous as fire and as varied in colour as blue, yellow and red, etc. As result of this meditation, emerges the seed-mantra in the form of a point in the lotus of the heart as bright as a flame of lamp or the solar orb which indeed is the flame of consciousness.
svayaṃbhāsātmanānena tādātmyaṃ yātyananyadhīḥ | śivena hematāṃ yadvattāmraṃ sūtena vedhitam |	This practice evolves luminosity in the Self. The fully self-absorbed wise aspirant identifies himself with Siva in brilliance in the same way as copper being purified by the goldsmith, assumes the brightness of gold.
upalakṣaṇametacca sarvamantreṣu lakṣayet | yadyatsaṃkalpasaṃbhūtaṃ varṇajālaṃ hi bhautikam |	Those groups of letters are worldly, which are products of the human imagination.
tat saṃvidādhikyavaśādabhautikamiva sthitam | atastathāvidhe rūpe rūḍho rohati saṃvidi | | anācchāditarūpāyāmanupādhau prasannadhīḥ | nīle pīte sukhe duḥkhe saṃvidrūpamakhaṇḍitam |	The same get spiritualised when it becomes predominated by consciousness. -a Being thus transformed the aspirant gladly rises upward on the staircase of consciousness fully disclosed and free of superimposition. b-a Behind the looks of the blue and yellow, and experiences of pleasure and pain the character of consciousness is one and the same absolutely undivided.
gurubhirbhāṣitaṃ tasmādupāyeṣu vicitratā | uccārakaraṇadhyānavarṇairebhiḥ pradarśitaḥ |	b-a Herewith has beenshown the way toand method of attainment of the transcendent state of Śiva-hood via pronunciation, means, meditation and alphabets.
anuttarapadaprāptāvabhyupāyavidhikramaḥ | akiṃciccintanaṃ vīryaṃ bhāvanāyāṃ ca sā punaḥ| dhyāne tadapi coccāre karaṇe so'pi taddhvanau | sa sthānakalpane bāhyamiti kramamupāśrayet |	b- a āņava Upāya Abstaining oneself from thinking in course of this individualistic sādhanā, āṇavopāya, gives it its virility. The same becomes more effective if supplemented by emotion bhāvanā. It becomes more effective if done meditatively and more so if getting added to it the beauty of pronunciation and efficacy of the sound.
laṅghanena paro yogī mandabuddhiḥ krameṇa tu | vīrya vinā yathā ṣaṣṭhastasyāpyastyatha vā balam | mṛtadeha iveyaṃ syād bāhyāntaḥ parikalpanā | |	b- As a man becomes an eunuch on account of lacking in virility, and over and above that just like a dead body if lacking in energy, even so all subsidiary means to Śiva-hood become useless if made bereft of the primary ones.
ityāṇave'nuttaratābhyupāyaḥ prokto nayaḥ spaṣṭapathena bāhyaḥ| sthānaprakalpākhyatayā sphuṭastu | brāhyo'bhyupāyaḥ pravivicyate'tha |	Thus has been explained here the individualistic approach to the Transcendent Reality in all its clarity and externality. CHAPTER - C Essence of Time Now is being discussed clearly the topic known as Sthāna-Prakalpanā which is an external means to transformation of the lowly individual soul into the higher Siva-hood.
sthānabhedastridhā proktaḥ prāṇe dehe bahistathā | prāṇaśca pañcadhā dehe dvidhā bāhyāntaratvataḥ |	Sthāna, loci, are three, namely, the prāna, the body and external objects. Prānas in the body are five while they are of two kinds from another viewpoint, i.e., external and internal.
maṇḍalaṃ sthaṇḍilaṃ pātramakṣasūtraṃ sapustakam | liṅga tūraṃ paṭa pustaṃ pratimā mūrtireva ca |	External loci are eleven, namely, mandala, sthandila, pātra, aksa sūtra, pustaka, linga, tūra, pata, pusta, pratimā, and mürti.
ityekādaśadhā bāhyaṃ punastadbahudhā bhavet | tatra prāṇāśrayaṃ tāvadvidhānamupadiśyate |	These eleven external means have further the probability of being divided again. Now is being taken up for discussion the system relating to prāna.
adhvā samasta evāyaṃ ṣaḍvidho'pyativistṛtaḥ | yo vakṣyate sa ekatra prāṇe tāvatpratiṣṭhitaḥ |	- All these six kinds of paths are considerably detailed and are based on prāna. This will be discussed together.
adhvanaḥ kalanaṃ yattatkramākramatayā sthitam | kramākramau hi citraikakalanā bhāvagocare |	Deliberations on the path are causal as well as non-causal. Both of them, however, are perceptible like appreciation of a work of plastic art.
kramākramātmā kālaśca para saṃvidi vartate | kālī nāma parā śakti saiva devasya gīyate |	Time is the essence of both kinds of arrangements, causal and non-causal while in itself its locus is consciousness. It, indeed, is the supernal force of the Lord.
saiva saṃvidbahiḥ svātmagarbhībhūtau kramākramau | sphuṭayantī praroheṇa prāṇavṛttiriti sthitā |	It is consciousness itself which being pregnant with both kinds of order, that is, causal and non-causal, while growing outside, it assumes the form of the tendency of breath.
saṃvinmātraṃ hi yacchuddhaṃ prakāśaparamārthakam | tanmeyamātmanaḥ projya viviktaṃ bhāsate nabhaḥ | tadeva śūnyarūpatvaṃ saṃvidaḥ parigīyate| neti neti vimarśena yogināṃ sā parā daśā |	Consciousness, as distinct from what it is conscious of, is pure, luminous and the highest to be craved for. It is what needs to be understood as free of the claim of the individual over his ownership of it and when so understood, it illumines as the sky. Essence of Time Herein lies its nullity mentioned in various ways, as by yogins in the form of contemplation over things other than this as neti neti, 'not this’, ‘not this’ indicating to it as the supernal state of being.
sa eva svātmā meye'sminbhedite svīkriyonmukhaḥ | patansamucchalattvena prāṇaspandormisaṃjñitaḥ |	It is that supernal state of being, which is one's own self which tends to be owned by the individual after breaking through the entire cluster of whatever is to be understood.
tenāhuḥ kila saṃvitprāṇe pariṇatā tathā | antaḥkaraṇattattvasya vāyurāśrayatāṃ gataḥ | iyaṃ sā prāṇanāśaktirāntarodyogadohadā | spandaḥ sphurattā viśrāntirjīvo hṛtpratibhā matā |	It, indeed, is the overflow of the throb of it which emerges as the vibration of the prānic energy. This is why it has been said that consciousness has got transformed into prāna amounting to inner beings taking resort to breath. Indeed, it is the force of breathing which being motivated by the inmost desire to manifest itself assumes the form of the throb of living in the form of the hearty luminosity.
sā prāṇavṛttiḥ prāṇādyaiḥ rūpaiḥ pañcabhirātmasāt | dehaṃ yatkurute saṃvitpūrṇastenaiṣa bhāsate |	It is the desire of the curvature of consciousness to breathe on account of which it assumes the form of the five prāna, etc. and fills the body with the illumination of consciousness.
prāṇanāvṛttitādātmyasaṃvitkhacitadehajām | ceṣṭāṃ paśyantyato mugdhā nāstyanyaditi manyate |	It is owing to perception of the activities of the body born of assumption by consciousness in the form of breathing that ignorant people conceive that there is nothing else in the human personality apart from breathing.
tāmeva bālamūrkhastrīprāyaveditṛsaṃśritām | matiṃ pramāṇīkurvantaścarvākāstattvadarśinaḥ |	It is by according verity to this false view held generally by children, fools and womenfolk that the Cārvākas, materialists, have become seers of the ultimate truth.
teṣāṃ tathā bhāvanā ceddāryameti nirantaram | tadehabhaṅge suptāḥ syurātādṛgvāsanākṣayāt | tadvāsanākṣaye tveṣāmakṣīṇaṃ vāsanāntaram | buddhaṃ kutaścitsaṃsūte vicitrāṃ phalasampadam |	If this viewpoint of them goes on gaining strength continuously, they are sure to remain lying dead along with all their passions sticking to their inner being. Even on immediate passions having been exhausted, other kinds of passion may remain stuck to him as a result of which he may have to suffer the peculiar consequence of them on getting awakened. This atheistic viewpoint has been condemned as more vicious than what is considered as vicious on account of the following five reasons: Essence of Time It is unsteady, as it is unauthoritative.
| adāḍharyaśaṅkanātprācyavāsanātādavasthyataḥ anyakartavyaśaithilyātsaṃbhāvyānuśayatvataḥ |	On account of laying emphasis on secondary observances, it is diversionary from the main path. It is full of the fault of leaving impressions unobliterated. It is likely to mislead others, too, who are of a viewpoint quite different from it.
alamaprastutenātha prakṛtaṃ pravivicyate | yāvānsamasta evāyamadhvā prāṇe pratiṣṭhitaḥ |	- Enough with the diversion. Coming back to the proper context, this path of non-dualistic śaivism is based entirely on the verity of prāna.
dvidhā ca so'dhvā kriyayā mūrtyā ca pravibhajyate | prāṇa eva śikhā śrīmattriśirasyuditā hi sā |	This whole path is divided between action and object. As has been observed in Trisiras, crest is the prāna. It is tied on the occasion of sacrifice, etc., lest the performance may not become fruitless.
baddhā yāgādikāle tu niṣkalatvācchivātmikā | yato'horātramadhye'syāścaturviśatidhā gatiḥ |	Its tying, indeed, is auspicious, as in course of a day and night it is likely to take as many as twenty-four hundreds of outlets of hairy pores. Night, moon and sound come together in this state.
jīvādityo na codgacchettuṭyarthaṃ sāndhyamīdṛśam | ūrdhvavaktro raviścandro'dhomukho vahnirantare |	- The sun stands for the jīva, the central essence of life. He has as yet not risen. Hence the state of time is that of sandhyā, twilight or dusk and not for a while. The orb of the sun is tending upward while the moon is tending downward and lire is lying in the middle.
mādhyāhnikī mokṣadā syād vyomamadhyasthito raviḥ | anastamitasāro hi jantucakraprabodhakaḥ |	This state is characterised as the intermediate, mādhyāhniki, midday. It is the time favourable to liberation, as the sun lies in the middle of the sky with his full splendour and hence is favourable to the unfoldment of the cakra of the essence of life, jiva.
binduḥ prāṇo yahaścaiva ravirekatra tiṣṭhati | mahāsandhyā tṛtīyā tu supraśāntātmikā sthitā |	- Bindu, point, stands for the essence of life, jiva, while day for the sun. Meeting ground of the two is the third factor and is characterised by mahā- sandhyā, the great intermediate occasion.
evaṃ baddhā śikhā yatra tattatphalaniyojikā | ataḥ saṃvidi sarvo'yamadhvā viśramya tiṣṭhati |	Keeping the crest tied on this occasion, therefore, yields considerable result. Thus, this path of devotion to Śiva ultimately ends up in consciousness.
amūrtāyāḥ sarvagatvānniṣkriyāyāśca saṃvidaḥ | mūrtikriyābhāsanaṃ yatsa evādhvā maheśituḥ |	Consciousness is abstract as well as immune to action. Even then, if it has assumed the form of the concrete and role of the active, that all is due to the course adopted by the Great Lord.
adhvā krameṇa yātavye pade saṃprāptikāraṇam | dvaitināṃ bhogyabhāvāttu prabuddhānāṃ yato'dyate |	The word adhvan, meaning 'path' stands for the means by making use of which the aspirant attains the end which lies in getting the object of enjoyment by the dualists and getting assimilated to Siva by the wise.
iha sarvatra śabdānāmanvarthaṃ caryayedyataḥ uktaṃ śrīmanniśācāre saṃjñātra trividhā matā |	Since here is the necessity of consideration over the exact meaning of words, Essence of Time it has been maintained in the Niśācāra that denominations are of three kinds.
naimittikī prasiddhā ca tathānyā paribhāṣikī | pūrvatve vā pradhānaṃ syāttatrāntarbhāvayettataḥ |	These kinds are naimittika, purposive, popularistic and definitive. Out of these three kinds, it is the former which needs to be considered as the cause of latter ones also.
ato'dhvaśabdasyokteyaṃ niruktirnoditāpi cet | kvacitsvabuddhyā sāpyūmahyā kiyallekhyaṃ pustake | tatra kriyābhāsanaṃ yatso'dhvā kālāhna ucyate| varṇamantrapadābhikhyamatrāste'dhvatrayaṃ sphuṭam |	Thus, the word adhvan needs to be taken to have been derived from the root ad, to eat. This derivation is purposive and amounts to attainment of a certain objective indicating enjoyment aptly to be symbolised by eating. If the derivation has not been given in the text, it may be understood by the reader himself as it is not always possible for the author to put everything in writing. That adhvan is characterised as related with time which reflects action.
yastu mūrtyavabhāsāṃśaḥ sa deśādhvā nigadyate | kalātattvapurābhikhyamantarbhūtamiha trayam | | trikadvaye'tra pratyekaṃ sthūlaṃ sūkṣmaṃ paraṃ vapuḥ | yato'sti tena sarvo'yamadhvā ṣaḍvidha ucyate |	In this context, there emerge clearly three kinds of path depending on letter, mantra and word. That part of the adhvan, path, is characterised as spatial which reflects form while the other one reflecting time is considered as related to kalā, form, tattva, essence, and pura, locus. Both these triads of path again are distinguished each by features of grossness, subtleness and transcendence.
ṣaḍvidhādadhvanaḥ prācyaṃ yadetattritayaṃ punaḥ | eṣa eva sa kālādhvā prāṇe spaṣṭaṃ pratiṣṭhitaḥ |	Thus all the paths taken together become of six kinds. Out of all the six varieties, the original triad is again considered as related to time which obviously is based on prāna, life-force.
tattvamadhyasthitātkālādanyo'yaṃ kāla ucyate | eṣa kālo hi devasya viśvābhāsanakāriṇī | kriyāśaktiḥ samastānāṃ tattvānāṃ ca paraṃ vapuḥ | etadīśvaratattvaṃ tacchivasya vapurucyate | |	Time as operative among essences is different from the other one which serves as the divine force of manifestation of the universe known otherwise as kriyā- sakti, force of action and hence as the body of all essences. This, indeed, is Iśvara, the body of Śiva.
udriktābhogakāryātmaviśvaikātmyamidaṃ yataḥ | etadīśvararūpatvaṃ paramātmani yatkila |	- It is that state of Being in which there is inclination for manifestation on the one side and the hold of unity on the other both the tendencies acting on the Reality in a balanced way. It, indeed, is the Isvara-aspect of the Supreme Lord.
tatpramātari māyīye kālatattvaṃ nigadyate | śivādiśuddhavidyāntaṃ yacchivasya svakaṃ vapuḥ | tadeva puṃso māyādirāgāntaṃ kañcukībhavet | anāśritaṃ yato māyā kalāvidye sadāśivaḥ |	In the case of the individual, overwhelmed by māyā, delusion, it is known as the factor of time. In fact, what is Śiva on account of forming the body of Śiva from the point of view of pure knowledge, suddha-vidyā, the same gets reduced to kañcuka, disguise, being vitiated by factors of māyā, rāga, etc.
īśvara kālaniyatī sadvidyā rāga ucyate | anāśritaḥ śūnyamātā buddhimātā sadāśivaḥ | īśvaraḥ prāṇamātā ca vidyā dehapramātṛtā | anāśrayo hi śūnyatvaṃ jñānameva hi buddhitā |	b-a Anāśrita, that which is not dependent on anything, is the knower of void sunya, while Sadāśiva is the knower of intellect; Iśvara is the knower of the prāna, life- force while vidyā, knowledge, is the knower of the real vidyā, sadvidyā. b- a Baselessness amountstonothingness,whileintellectionamountstounderstanding.
viśvātmatā ca prāṇatvaṃ dehe vedyaikatānatā | tena prāṇapathe viśvākalaneyaṃ virājate |	Similarly vitality aims at universality and uniformity of understanding in relation to the body. Thus, it is by traversing on the path of the life-force that has emerged the entire calculation of universality.
yena rūpeṇa tadvacmaḥ sadbhistadavadhīyatām |	All these deliberations are intended for bringing home to the reader this truth.
dvādaśāntāvadhāvasmindehe yadyapi sarvataḥ | | otaprotātmakaḥ prāṇastathāpīsthaṃ na susphuṭaḥ | yatno jīvanamātrātmā tatparaśca dvidhā mataḥ |	b-a Although prāna, the life-force, operates throughout the entire body measuring twelve finger-ends, yet this is not so much obvious. b-a Sri Tantrāloka Effort is the essence of life which is of two kinds, sensitive and insensitive.
saṃvedyaścāpyasaṃvedyo dvidhatthaṃ bhidyate punaḥ |	One needs to contemplate on them in a twofold manner, obvious and obscure.
saṃvedyajīvanābhikhyaprayatnaspandasundaraḥ | prāṇaḥ kandātprabhṛtyeva tathāpyatra na susphuṭaḥ |	b- Prāna, life-force, starts functioning, though not obviously, from the complex of nerves close to the navel and known as kanda. Its throb is sensed and serves as the basis of life.
kandādhārātprabhṛtyeva vyavasthā tena kathyate | svacchandaśāstre nāḍīnāṃ vāyvādhāratayā sphuṭam |	The Svacchanda Tantra has clearly mentioned it as the basis of the entire function of breathing and hence has claimed on its behalf the whole management of the bodily function.
tatrāpitu prayatno'sau na saṃvedyatayā sthitaḥ | vedyayatnāttu hṛdayātprāṇacāro vibhajyate |	As such, I will tell you categorically and clearly how the prāna gets divided in the heart as a result of effort of the aspirant.
prabhoḥ śivasya yā śaktirvāmā jyeṣṭhā ca raudrikā | satadanyatamāvātmaprāṇau yatnavidhāyiau | prabhuśaktiḥ kvacinmukhyā yathāṅgamarudīraṇe | ātmaśaktiḥ kvacitkandasaṃkocaspandane yathā | prāṇaḥśaktiḥ kvacitprāṇacāre hārde yathā sphuṭam | trayaṃ dvayaṃ vā mukhyaṃ syādyogināmavadhāninām |	Out of the three forces of Lord Śiva, namely, vāmā, jyestha and raudri, anyone along with ātman and prāņa combines to serve as an agent of the effort Essence of Time Somewhere the Lord's force serves as the main factor in mobilisation of the part of the body concerned as is exemplified by the closing and opening of the eyelids while the self-force becomes effective in the case of contraction and expansion of the kanda. Similarly, the life-force becomes primary in certain cases, such as in the mobilisation of the heart. Out of all these forces, all the three or just two serve as the main particularly in the case of attentive yogins.

The force of Siva known as vāmā is instrumental in bringing out the worldliness, while jyesthā leads to unification with Siva and raudri removes obstacles in enjoying results of actions.
sṛṣṭyādittvamajñātvā na mukto nāpi mocayet | uktaṃ ca śrīyogacāre mokṣaḥ sarvaprakāśanāt | |	One who does not know the purpose and process of creation, sustenance and dissolution, does not deserve emancipation nor can he liberate anyone.

hṛda ārabhya yattena rātrindivavibhājanam | tadasatsitapakṣe'ntaḥ praveśollāsabhāgini | abuddhasthānamevaitaddinatvena kathaṃ bhavet| alaṃ vānena nedaṃ vā mama prāṅmatamatsaraḥ |	How can day be possible where the aspirant becomes introverted in the dark phase of the month and experiences sheer delight?

heye tu darśite śiṣyāḥ satpathaikāntadarśinaḥ | vyākhyātaḥ kṛṣṇapakṣo yastatra prāṇagataḥ śaśī | |	Exposure of anything unacceptable turns the attention of students exclusively towards the right path. The dark phase of the month has been explained wherein the moon lies in the prāņa and needs to get rid of one section of her each day.
āpyāyanātmanaikaikāṃ kalāṃ pratitithi tyajet | dvādaśāntasamīpe tu yāsau pañcadaśī tuṭi |	When she reaches close to the twelfth dvādaśānta, that is the fifteenth tuti, there occurs the climax of the dark half of the month wherein the attenuated moon enters into the sun in the form of prāna, life-breath.
uktaṃ śrīkāmikāyāṃ ca nordhve'dhaḥ prakṛtiḥ parā | ardhārdhe kramate māyā dvikhaṇḍā śivarūpiṇī |	-a It has been observed in the Kāmikā śāstra that the Supreme Nature lies neither upward nor below. She moves the half-way being divided in the form of Śiva.
candrasūryātmanā dehaṃ pūrayetpravilāpayet| amṛtaṃ candrarūpeṇa dvidhā ṣoḍaśadhā punaḥ |	She fills the body in the form of the moon and the sun also dissolves in it.
pibanti ca surāḥ sarve daśapañca parāḥ kalāḥ| amā śeṣaguhāntasthāmāvāsyā viśvatarpiṇī |	- a All the divinities drink the fifteen as well as above fifteen sections of the moon in a twofold and sixteen-fold manner leaving only the amā as the remainder lying in the cave for satiating the world.
evaṃ kalāḥ pañcadaśa kṣīyante śaśinaḥ kramāt | āpyāyinyamṛtābūpatādātmyātṣoḍaśī na tu |	b- In this way, the fifteen sections of the moon get attenuated one after the other leaving only the sixteenth immortal in the form of apas getting identified with the sun.
tatra pañcadaśī yāsau tuṭi prakṣīṇacandramāḥ | tadūrdhvagaṃ yattuvyardhaṃ pakṣasaṃdhiḥ sa kīrtitaḥ |	As regard the fifteenth tuti in which the moon gets completely attenuated, the upper half of it is known as the factor of unification of the two halves of the month.
tasmādviśramatuṭyardhādāmāvasyaṃ purādalam | paraṃ prātipadaṃ cārdhamiti saṃdhiḥ sa kalpyate | tatra prātipade tasmistuṭyardhārdhe purādalam | āmāvasyaṃ tithicchedātkuryātsūryagrahaṃ viśat |	Thus this tuti represents the joint of the two halves of the month. Essence of Time In this state of things, when the second half of the tuti enters into the first one known as related to the dark half of the month, āmāvāsya, the juncture needs to be treated as one of solar eclipse.
tatrārkamaṇḍale līnaḥ śaśī sravati yanmadhu | taptavāttatpibedindusahabhūḥ siṃhikāsutaḥ |	As a consequence of the eclipse, the moon gets eclipsed within the sun and trickles her nectar.

The sun is the validator while the moon is the object of validation making them thus the objects of knowledge and action respectively. Thus, the Rāhu becomes the māyā-pramātā, empirical self governed by delusion. Being of the form of only coverage, the Rāhu is incapable of nullifying the sun.
arkendurāhusaṃghaṭṭāt pramāṇa vedyavedako | advayena satatastena puṇya eṣa mahāgrahaḥ |	Owing to meeting of the sun, moon and Rāhu, representing respectively the canon of validation, the object of knowledge and the knower, the moment becomes non-dualistic and hence highly auspicious.
amāvasyāṃ vināpyeṣa saṃghaṭṭaścenmahāgrahaḥ | yathārke meṣage rāhāvaśvinīsthe'śvinīdine|	In case such an interaction occurs among these celestial agencies on some date other than āmāvāsya, night of the new moon, such as when the sun is in the Mesa Aries and the Rāhu is in the āśvina Gemini and the day also is the Aśvina, the occasion become more sanctifying.
āmāvāsyaṃ yadā tvardhaṃ līnaṃ prātipade dale | pratipacca viśuddhā syāttanmokṣo dūrage vidhau |	Where the half tuti of the āmāvāsya disappears in the prātipada half, first day of the moon, the prātipada becomes pure as the eclipse remains remote from the moon.
grāsamokṣāntare snānadhyānahomajapādikam | laukikālaukikaṃ bhūyaphalaṃ syātpāralaukikam |	The period intervening the beginning and end of eclipse is sacred for bath, meditation, oblation, japa, etc., for getting results, worldly, other-worldly and transcendent.

The function of breathing remains continuous irrespective of the fact of the negative or positive division of date, coughing and sneezing voluntarily or involuntarily no matter owing to release or obstruction. Essence of Time In this way, when prāņa as the sun, enters into the moon, as she is dipped in nectar, the aspirant needs to fill the moon gradually with the awareness of each tuti.
kramasaṃpūraṇāśāliśaśāṅkāmṛtasundarāḥ | tuṭya pañcadaśaitāḥ syustithayaḥ sitapakṣagāḥ |	Filling up the moon in this way, the fifteen tutis transform the moon in that of the bright half.
antyāyāṃ pūrṇamastuṭyāṃ pūrvavatpakṣasandhitā | indrugrahaśca pratipatsandhau pūrvapraveśataḥ | |	- In the final tuti also, there is eclipse of the moon divided into two, as earlier, into that which is related with the dark half of the month and that with the bright one.
aihikaṃ grahaṇaṃ cātra sādhakānāṃ mahāphalam | prāgvadanyadayaṃ māsaḥ prāṇacāre'bda ucyate |	This time of eclipse is potent with great result for aspirants. As earlier, here, too, the month may be treated in terms of the process of breathing.
ṣaṭsu ṣaṭsvaṅaguleṣvarko hṛdayānmakarādiṣu | tiṣṭhanmāghādikaṃ ṣaṭkaṃ kuryāttaccottarāyaṇam | saṃkrāntitritaye vṛtte bhuṃkte cāṣṭādaśāṅgule | meṣaṃ prāpte ravau puṇyaṃ viṣuvatpāralaukikam | | pradeśe tu tulāsthe'rke tadeva viṣuvadbhavet | iha siddhipradaṃ caitaddakṣiṇāyanagaṃ tataḥ |	- Each one of the six finger-ends of space between the heart and the nose may be accorded to each movement of the sun in passing from one constellation to the other beginning from maghā known as uttarāyana, vernal equinox After crossing three constellations, namely, Makara Capricorn, Kumbha Aquarius and Mina Pisces, and covering eighteen finger-ends of space on the psychological side, and thus coming to the constellation known as Mesa Aries, the aspirant arrives at the central day of the year coinciding with the sun which is an occasion of supramental significance.
garbhatā prodbubhūṣiṣyadbhāvaścāthodbubhūṣutā udbhaviṣyattvamudbhutiprārambho'pyudbhavasthitiḥ janma sattā pariṇatirvṛddhisaḥ kṣayaḥ kramāt | makarādīni tenātra kriyā sūte sadṛkphalam |	Birth of an individual involves the following processes: putting the seed into the womb, desire on the part of the seed to manifest, manifestation, beginning of manifestation, birth, existence, change, growth, decay and destruction one followed by the other while the constellations like makara, etc., yield results as per their nature.
praveśe khalu tatraiva śāntipuṣṭyādisundaram | karma syādaihikaṃ tacca dūradūraphalaṃ kramāt |	- For getting results in matters worldly, practice should be started with the mina constellation while with the kumbha for success in regard to mantra, etc. Mina, Vrsa Taurus and Simha Leo constellations are favourable for siddhi of mantras.
nirgame dinavṛddhiḥ syādviparīte viparyayaḥ | varṣe'smiṃstithayaḥ pañca pratyaṅgulamiti kramaḥ |	- Essence of Time Span of the day goes on getting enlarged with the advent of vernal equinox and that of the night with the reversal of it. In this entire span, five dates accord with each finger-end.
tatrāpyahorātravidhiriti sarvaṃ hi pūrvavat |	In the same process falls also the alternation of day and night, as explained earlier.
prāṇīye varṣa etasminkārtikiādiṣu dakṣataḥ | pitāmahāntaṃ rudrāḥ syurdvādaśāgre'tra bhāvinaḥ | prāṇe varṣodayaḥ prokto dvādaśābdodayo'dhunā |	-a In this measurement of the span of year in terms of breaths beginning from the Kārtika and ending with āśvina, alternate also the Rudra numbering twelve and beginning with Daksa. b-a In relationship to breath is now going to be explained the duration of twelve years.
kharasāstithya ekasminnekasminnaṅagule kramāt | dvādaśābdodaye te ca caitrādyā dvādaśoditāḥ |	In this calculation, sixty days and nights are accommodated within one finger-end and in course of time of twelve years come the months, Caitra etc. twelve times each.
caitre mantroditiḥ so'pi tālunyukto'dhunā punaḥ| hṛdi caitroditistena tatra mantrodayo'pi hi |	b- Ascendancy of the month of Caitra is in the palate. The ascendancy shifts to the heart at the end of twelve years. There also lies the ascendancy of the mantra.
pratyaṅgulaṃ tithīnāṃ tu triśate parikalpite | sapañcāṃśāṅgule'bda syātprāṇe ṣaṣṭyabdatā punaḥ | |	Each finger-end encompasses three hundred dates; one finger-end and a fifth of the same cover a year while one movement of prāņa and apāna each get encompassed sixty years.
śatāni ṣaṭ sahasrāṇi caikaviṃśatirityayam | vibhāga prāṇaga ṣaṣṭivarṣāhorātra ucyate | | praharāharniśāmāsaṛtvabdaraviṣaṣṭigaḥ yaśchedastatra yaḥ sandhiḥ sa puṇyo dhyānapūjane |	An individual breathes twenty-one thousand six hundred times during a day and night. Exactly the same is the number of days and nights combined in the span of sixty years. The division of time into states, day and night, month, season, year, twelve years and sixty years and the consequent ends and starts during those divisions are sacred for the purpose of meditation and worship.
iti prāṇodaye yo'yaṃ kālaḥ śaktyekavigrahaḥ | viśvātmāntaḥ sthitastasya bāhye rūpaṃ nirūpyate |	The analysis of time that has been presented here particularly in relationship to the process of breathing, that indeed, is a throb of the Force indwelling the Universal Being and manifesting outside as such.

The same being divided by , yields the number of days and nights of gods and Fathers. The number of breaths, ,, when divided by the number of days in a human year, yields years of gods and Fathers.
prāṇasaṃkhyāṃ vadettatra ṣaṣṭyādyabdodayaṃ punaḥ | uktaṃ ca gurubhiḥ śrīmadrauravādisvavṛttiṣu |	b-a This has been stated by my revered teacher as well as by Tantras like Raurava, etc.
devānāṃ yadahorātraṃ mānuṣāṇāṃ sa hāyana | śatatrayeṇa ṣaṣṭhyā ca nṛṇāṃ vibudhavatsaraḥ |	b that The length of the divine day and night is the same as that of a human year, a is, days.
śrīmatsvacchandaśāstre ca tadeva matamīkṣyate | pitṝṇāṃ tadahorātramityupakramya pṛṣṭhataḥ |	The same view has been reviewed in the Svacchanda Tantra under the background that what is the extent of a human year is the extent of a divine day and night.

pradhāne yadahorātraṃ tajjaṃ varṣaśataṃ vibhoḥ | śrīkaṇṭhasyāyuretacca dinaṃ kañcukavāsinām | |	Measured by day and night lived in Pradhāna, the life of Śrikantha extends for one hundred years. The same is the extent of the life of those who attained the state of dissolution in Nature.
tatkramānnitayatiḥ kālo rāgo vidyā kaletyamī | yāntyanyonyaṃ layaṃ teṣāmāyurgāhanikaṃ dinam |	Accordingly, niyati, kāla, rāga, vidyā and kalā get dissolved into their next ones. Those would be the extent of their lives of as many days.
taddinaprakṣaye viśvaṃ māyāyāṃ pravilīyate | kṣīṇāyāṃ niśi tāvatyāṃ gahaneśaḥ sṛjetpunaḥ |	Essence of Time At the end of that day, the universe would dissolve into māyā. With the end of the night of the same duration, Lord Gahaneśa may create the world again.
evamavyaktakālaṃ tu parādhairdaśabhirjahi | māyāhastāvatī rātrirbhavetpralaya eṣa saḥ |	That would be the day of māyā and the same would be the extent of its night amounting to dissolution.
māyākālaṃ parārdhānāṃ guṇayitvā śatena tu | aiśvaro divaso nādaḥ prāṇātmātra sṛjejjagat | tāvatī caiśvarī rātriryatra prāṇaḥ praśāmyati | prāṇagarbhasthamapyatra viśvaṃ sauṣumnavartmanā | |	Multiply the period of māyā by one hundred parārdhas and that would be the extent of the day of Iśvara. During the day of Iśvara, nāda, sound, as the essence of prāna, life-force, creates the world. That is the duration of īśvara's night where prāņa bcomes silent. The world lying in the womb of the prāņa also gets interiorised along the path of susumnā.
prāṇe brahmavile śānte saṃvidyāpyavaśiṣyate | aṃśāṃśikāto'pyetasyāḥ sūkṣmasūkṣmataro layaḥ |	With the silence of the prāņa in the susumnā, consciousness, samvidyā remains there, which also, however, goes on getting subtlised in parts amounting to its complete dissolution.
guṇayitvaiśvaraṃ kālaṃ parārdhānāṃ śatena tu| sadāśivaṃ dinaṃ rātrirmahāpralaya eva ca |	By multiplying the period of Iśvara by one hundred parārdhas is obtained the day and the night of Sadāśiva as the ultimate state of dissolution.
sadāśivaḥ svakālānte bindvardhendunirodhikāḥ | ākramya nāde līyeta gṛhītvā sacarācaram | nādo nādāntavṛttyā tu bhittvā brahmabilaṃ haṭhāt | śaktitattve layaṃ yāti nijakālaparikṣaye |	Sadāśiva, at the end of His period crossing over the bindu, the ardhendu and nirodhini dissolves Himself, along with the entire mobile and immobile creation, into the nāda, sound. As regard sound, it, too, having pierced forcibly through the hold of Brahmā, dissolves itself into Sakti, at the end of its period of existence.
etāvacchaktitattve tu vijñeyaṃ khalvaharniśam | tu śaktiḥ svakālavilaye vyāpinyāṃ loyate punaḥ |	So far needs to be understood the continuation of the concepts of day and night as obtaining in Śakti, which, too, however, dissolves in an entity known as vyāpini, pervasive, at the end of its period.
vyāpinyāṃ taddivārātraṃ līyate sāpyanāśrite| parārdhakoṭyā hatvāpi śaktikālamanāśrite | dinaṃ rātriśca tatkāle parārdhaguṇite'pi ca | so'pi yāti layaṃ sāmyasaṃjñe sāmanase pade |	Day and night get dissolved into the vyāpinī while the vyāpini itself gets dissolved into the anāśrita. By multiplying the period of Sakti by means of a parārdha, we get the extent of the day of the anāśrita. Essence of Time Day and night get dissolved into the immediacy multiplied even by a parārdha. The immediacy also gets dissolved into the equipoise known as sāmya.
sa kālaḥ sāmyasaṃjñaḥ syānnityo'kalya kalātmakaḥ | yattatsāmanasaṃ rūpaṃ tatsāmyaṃ brahma viśvagam |	The period of sāmya is eternal, incalculable and artistic in its form. What is equipoise is the equivalence of Brahman which is all-pervading.
ataḥ sāmanasātkālānnimeṣonmeṣamātrataḥ| tṛṭyādikaṃ parārdhāntaṃ sūte saivātra niṣṭhitam |	It is the power of equipoise which out of its equivalence creates unmesa, nimesa and tuti, up to parārdha remaining subsistent within them all the while.
daśaśatasahasramayutaṃ lakṣaniyutakoṭi sārbudaṃ vṛndam | kharvanikharve śaṃkhābjajaladhimadhyāntamatha parārdhaṃ ca |	Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, lakh, ten lakh, crore, ten crore, arbud, ten arbud = vrinda, kharva, ten kharva, nikharva śankha, kamala, samudra, madhya, anta and parārdha.
ityekasmātprabhṛti hi daśadhā daśadhā krameṇa kalayitvā | ekādiparārdhānteṣvaṣṭādaśasu sthitiṃ brūyāt |	These numberals beginning from one and ending with parārdha are arrived at through multiplication of the earlier one by ten at each of the eighteen steps mentioned here.

The creational Eggs also are four and are related to the Bhü, Prakrti, Māyā and śakti The fire of time, kālāgni, serves as the agent of dissolution on the level of the first three Creational Eggs while Siva is the root cause of both creation and dissolution on all the planes. He alone is the cause of both dissolution and creation.
tallayo vāntarastasmādeka sṛṣṭilayeśitā | śrīmānaghoraḥ śaktayante saṃhartā sṛṣṭikṛcca saḥ | tatsṛṣṭau sṛṣṭisaṃhārā niḥsaṃkhyā jagatāṃ yataḥ| antarbhūtāstataḥ śāktī mahāsṛṣṭirudāhṛtā |	As He creates as also dissolves the world over and above Sakti, He is known as Aghora. - It is within the ambit of His creation that creations and dissolutions of all sorts remain taking place innumerably. All other agents of creation, such as Brahmā, Visnu and Rudras are subservient to Him. All this creational task is carried out by the Sakti and is characterised as Mahāsrsti, the great creation.
laye brahmā harī rudraśatānyaṣṭakapañcakam | ityenyonyaṃ kramādyanti layaṃ māyāntake'dhvani |	In the state of dissolution Brahmā, Visnu and hundred and forty Rudras get dissolved into one another and rest at the end of the path of māyā.
māyātattvalaye tvete prayānti paramaṃ padam | māyordhve ye sitādhvasthāsteṣāṃ paraśive layaḥ |	Following the dissolution of the Māyā also, they attain the highest state. -a Beyond the ambit of Māyā, those who are travellers of the Pure Path, suddha adhvā, get dissolved in Siva.
tatrāpyaupādhikādbhedāllaye bhedaṃ pare biduḥ | evaṃ tāttveśvare varge līne sṛṣṭau punaḥ pare | |	In view of some other savants, some difference from person to person subsists here, too, due to the difference of superimpositions. b-a Essence of Time Thus there emerge two orders of beings to control the next creation.
brāhmī nāma parasyaiva śaktistāṃ yatra pātayet |	b-a Brahmi is the force of the Supreme Being.
sa brahmā viṣṇurudrādyā vaiṣṇavyāderataḥ kramāt |	b-a NOTE: Three forces of the Supreme Being that give rise to Brahmā, Visnu and Rudra are Brahmi, Vaisnavi and Raudri respectively.
śaktimantaṃ vihāyānyaṃ śaktiḥ kiṃ yāti nedṛśama | chāditaprathitāśeṣaśaktireka śivastathā | evaṃ visṛṣṭipralayāḥ prāṇa ekatra niṣṭhitāḥ |	See Svacchanda Tantra, Since there is no instance of any force leaving its possessor and moving to anyone else, Siva remains as the only God whom the force in its entirety envelopes and promotes. b-a Thus, it is the fact that creations and dissolutions take place together on prāna as their base.
so'pi saṃvidi saṃvicca cinmātre jñeyavarjite | cinmātrameva devo ca sā parā parameśvarī | |	The prāna in itself is based on understanding while the understanding has its base in sheer consciousness bereft of its object. The Supreme Being and the Supreme Goddess all are pure consciousness.
aṣṭātriṃśaṃ ca tattattvaṃ hṛdayaṃ tatparāparam | tena saṃvittvamevaitatspandamānaṃ svabhāvataḥ | |	All thirty-eight constituent principles of creation are consciousness. Heart is the centre of understanding all about consciousness, the lower as well as the higher.
layodayā iti prāṇe ṣaṣṭyabdodayakīrtanam | icchāmātrapratiṣṭheyaṃ kriyāvaicitryacarcanā |	-a Thus, whatever is happening naturally in the form of dissolution as well as emergence is sheer throb in its recurrence of sixty years of circle on the base of prāṇa itself.
kālaśaktistato bāhye naitasyā niyataṃ vapuḥ | svapnasvapne tathā svapne supte saṃkalpagocare |	b-a However, curious an event, it occurs in keeping with the desire of the Lord. The force and operation of time are the outward manifestations of His desire which has no definite body of its own.
samādhau viśvasaṃhārasṛṣṭikramavivecane| mito'pi kila kālāṃśo vitatatvena bhāsate |	b-a Even a fraction of calculated time appears in dream within a dream as also in the state of sleep to the power of imagination as also in the state of samādhi as of the dimension of creation and dissolution of the universe.
pramātrabhede bhede'tha citro vitatimāpyasau | evaṃ prāṇe yathā kālaḥ kriyāvaicitryaśaktijaḥ | | tathāpāne'pi hṛdayānśūlapīṭhavisarpiṇi | mūlābhidhamahāpīṭhasaṅkocapravikāsayoḥ | | brahmādyanāśritāntānāṃ cinute sṛṣṭisaṃhṛtī |	This kind of experience is common to all irrespective of variation in the subject. b-a As the practitioner experiences in regard to the movement of the prāna, even so he realises in regard to the movement of the apāna from the heart up to the mūlādhāra cakra. b-a Via contraction and expansion of the mūlādhāra cakra, characterised as Essence of Time mahāpitha, in his movement from that cakra up to the ajñā, he experiences the processes of creation and dissolution taking place from Brahmā up to the Anāśrita.
avedyayatno yatnena yogibhiḥ samupāsyate | hṛtkandānandasaṃkocavikāsadvādaśāntā |	b-a Though the apāna also remains active like the prāņa throughout effortlessly, it gets transformed to this kind of worshippable state by yogins through the application of effort.
brahmādayo'nāśritāntāḥ sevyante'tra suyogibhiḥ | ete ca parameśānaśaktitvādviśvavartinaḥ |	b-a Operation of these divine agencies is universal on account of these being agents of the force of the Supreme Being.
dehamapyaśnuvānāstatkāraṇānīti kāmike |	Though enjoying their subsistence in the individual bodies, they, according to the Kāmika Sāstra, serve as their cause also.
bālyayauvanavṛddhatvanidhaneṣu punarbhave | muktau ca dehe brahmādyāḥ ṣaḍadhiṣṭhānakāriṇaḥ | tasyānte tu parā devī yatra yukto na jāyate |	b-a Brahmā, etc., dwell in their six respective places in the individual's body determining as authorities the states of childhood, youth, old age, death, rebirth and emancipation. b-a At the end of the Anāśrita, is the abode of the Supreme Goddess.
anena jñātamātreṇa dīkṣānugrahakṛdbhavet |	Having got associated with Her, the aspirant becomes free of the ordeal of rebirth bearing out the significance of the initiation into this tradition.
samastakāraṇollāsapade suvidite yataḥ |	b-a Kanda, as the source of all nerves, is the lower mouth, adho-vaktra of the human constitution.

kṣīyate tadupāsāyāṃ yenordhvādharaḍambaraḥ | atrāpānodaye prāgvatṣaṣṭyabdodayayojanām |	b-a Elevation of apāna from this point requires a project of sixty years of yogic practice proceeding along use of tuti, caşaka and finger-end before reaching the state of pūrṇa-māsī.
yāvatkurvīta tṛṭyāderyuktāṅgulavibhāgataḥ | evaṃ samāne'pi vidhiḥ sa hi hārdīṣu nāḍiṣu |	b-a The same is the case of the samāna vāyu, breath known as samāna. That is a nerve related with the heart.
saṃcaransarvatodikkaṃ daśadhaiva vibhāvyate | daśamukhyā mahānāḍī pūrayanneṣa tadgatāḥ |	It moves all over the body branching out into ten. b-a Essence of Time Ten are the main nerves in the human body which all are filled with this samāna vāyu.
nāḍyantarāśritā nāḍī krāmandehe samasthitiḥ|	There are many more nerves subservient to these flowing along which this vāyu maintains the balance of the body.
aṣṭāsu digdaleṣveṣa krāmaṃstaddikpateḥ kramāt | ceṣṭitānyanukurvāṇo raudraḥ saumyaśca bhāsate| sa eva nāḍītritaye vāmadakṣiṇamadhyage | indvarkāgnimaye mukhye carastiṣṭhatyaharniśam | sārdhanālīdvayaṃ prāṇaśatāni nava yaṃtsthitam |	b-a Moving along the nerves, this vāyu takes rounds in all eight directions and comes into contact with their divine controllers such as Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna, Kubera, etc., and gets impregnated with emotions corresponding to their natures, terrible, mild, etc. b-a It is the same vāyu which moves along the triad of nerves running on the left, right and in the middle of the two and related respectively to the moon, sun and Agni.

Thus at the expiry of nālis, at the time of the meridian via the right and equinoctrical one should breathe nine hundred times and pass on to another group of five sankrāntis via the right, upward, another right.
navāsuśatamekaikaṃ tato viṣuvaduttaram | pañcake pañcake'tīte saṃkrānterviṣuvahiḥ |	After each nine hundreds of breaths followed by the equinoctrical and lapse of five sankrāntis, comes another sankrānti and course of nine hundred breaths.
evaṃ rātrāvapītyevaṃ viṣuddivasātsamāt |	-a As is the case with the equinoctial day, so it is with the equinoctial night.
ārabhyāharniśāvṛddhihrāsasaṅkrāntigo'pyasau| rātryantadinapūrvāṃśau madhyāhnau divasakṣayaḥ |	In both the cases day and night respectively begin with lengthening and end with getting shortened. The equinoctrical points in the span of day and night are end of the night, first part of the day, meridian, end of the day, beginning and mid of the night.
sa śarvaryudayo madhyamudakto viṣutedṛśī | vyāptau viṣeryato vṛttiḥ sāmyaṃ ca vyāptirucyate |	b-a The word visuvat is formed out of the root vis, to pervade, while pervasion amounts to equivalence. The point of equivalence in time is known as visuvat.
tatkrameṇaiva saṃkrāntihrāsavṛddho divāniśoḥ| itthaṃ samānaruto varṣadvayavikalpanam | cāra ekatra nahyatra śvāsapraśvāsacarcanam|	b-a Shortening and lengthening in length of day and night beginning from the day of equivalence and the reversal of the same on the next time are processes of regular yearly occurrence. b-a Essence of Time This is the way the samāna vāyu acts during the period of any two years in its movement.
samāne'pi tuṭe pūrvaṃ yāvatṣaṣṭyabdagocaram |	b-a In regard to the samāna vāyu also sixty-yearly calculations have already been done in terms of tuti.
kālasaṃkhyā susūkṣmaikacāragā gaṇyate budhaiḥ | saṃdhyāpūrvāhṇāmadhyāhnamadhyarātrādi yatkila |	This calculation may be brought to further subtlety by the wise. b-a Evening, first point of the day, meridian and midnight, etc., may be used as sankrāntis depending on the results.
antaḥ saṃkrāntigaṃ grāhyaṃ tanmukhyaṃ tatphaloditeḥ| uktaḥ samānagaḥ kāla udāne tu nirūpyate |	b-a I have finished deliberation on the samāna vāyu. Now is beginning deliberation on the udāna.
prāṇavyāptau taduktaṃ tadudāne'pyatra kevalam | nāsāśaktyantayoḥ sthāne brahmarandhrordhvadhāmanī |	b Whatever has been said in regard to the pervasion of the prāna, the same applies to the udāna also except for the fact that the jurisdiction of the udāna extends from the nose up to the centre of Sakti in the higher region of the Brahma- randhra.
tenodāne'tra hṛdayānmūrdhanyadvādaśāntagam| tuṭyādiṣaṣṭivarṣāntaṃ viśvaṃ kālaṃ vicārayet |	Thus, the area of operation of the udāna vāyu extends from the heart up to the twelve finger-ends point in the head. It extends from a tuti up to sixty years.
vyāne tu viśvātmamaye vyāpake kramavarjite | sūkṣmasūkṣmocchadrūpamātraḥ kālo vyavasthitaḥ |	The vyāna vāyu is universally pervasive and bereft of order. There are only minute and still minuter throbs of time in it.
sṛṣṭiḥ pravilayaḥ sthemā saṃhāro'nugraho yataḥ | kramātprāṇadike kāle taṃ ta tatrāśrayettataḥ | prāṇacāre'tra yo varṇapadamantrodayaḥ sthitaḥ | yatnajo'yatnajaḥ sūkṣmaḥ paraḥ sthūlaḥ sa kathyate |	In the five kinds of breath in the body, namely, prāna, apāna, samāna, udāna and vyāna, also the same processes of creation, sustenance, dissolution, concealment and revelation are traceable in the same order. In course of movement of breath arise letter, word and mantra. This happens with effort and without effort.
eko nādātmako varṇaḥ sarvavarṇāvibhāgavān | so'nastamitarūpatvādanāhata ihoditaḥ |	They are of three qualities, subtle, transcendent and gross. Sound is only one. It serves as the basic stuff of all the letters implicit in it. Never does it become silent.
sa tu bhairavasadbhāvo mātṛsadbhāva eṣa saḥ| parā saikākṣarā devī yatra līnaṃ carācaram |	There is presence of Bhairava in it. The Mātrkā śakti also is present in it. She, indeed, is the monosyllabic goddess wherein lies implicit the entire world, mobile as well as immobile.
hrasvārṇatrayamekaikaṃ ravyaṅgulamathetarat | praveśa iti ṣaḍvarṇā sūryendupathagāḥ kramāt |	Each one of these is of the length of twelve finger-ends. They are solar. Combination of them with themselves each results in their lengthening, resulting thus in six letters. These are lunar.
ikārokārayorādisandhau saṃdhyakṣaradvayam | eo iti praveśe tu aiau iti dvayaṃ viduḥ |	Combination of a with i and u results primarily in e and o and again with the latter in ai and au.
ṣaṇṭhārṇāni praveśe tu dvādaśāntalalāṭayoḥ | gale hṛdi ca vindvarṇavisargau paritaḥ sthitau |	Reaching this state, they are pronounced from the dvādaśānta and the forehead, throat and heart and assume the form of bindu, point and visarga, dismissal.
kādipañcakamādyasya varṇasyāntaḥ sadoditam | evaṃ sasthānavarṇānāmantaḥ sā sārṇasantatiḥ |	The place of pronunciation of the k-group of letters in the vocal organ is the same as that of the initial one, that is, a. As such, they remain always manifest.
hṛdyeṣa prāṇarūpastu sakāro jīvanātmakaḥ | vindu prakāśo hārṇaśca pūraṇātmatayā sthitaḥ |	Though the place of pronunciation of the sounds s is the teeth, yet this sound being of the form of life, whose place is the heart, it arises from the heart while h pervades all in the form of light.
uktaḥ paro'yamudayo varṇānāṃ sūkṣma ucyate | praveśe ṣoḍaśaunmukhye ravayaḥ ṣaṇṭhavarjitā |	All vowel sounds entering into the stream of the apāna are sixteen but remain only twelve as falling into the prāna, leaving apartr and /. So is the case with the consonant sounds uttered via both the nostrils.
tadevendvarkamatrānye varṇāḥ sūkṣmodayastvayam | kālo'rdhamātraḥ kādīnāṃ trayastriṃśata ucyate | mātrā hrasvāḥ pañca dīrghāṣṭakaṃ dvistriḥ plutaṃ tu lṛ | ekāśītimimāmardhamātrāṇāmāha no gurūḥ |	This is the subtle origin of sounds. - a Half mora of the thirty-three consonant sounds beginning from k and ending with h also are thirty-three. Ten are the mora of five short vowels. Thirty-two are half mora of long vowels plus six of the pluta sounds such as / b-a Thus, my teacher has told me that all the sounds in half a mora number eighty- one.
yadvaśādbhagavānekāśītikaṃ mantramabhyadhāt | ekāśītipadā devī śaktiḥ proktā śivātmikā |	b It is because of this fact that Lord Śiva has revealed in His Śiva-Sūtra consisting of eighty-one sutras. Goddess Śakti also has been characterised as taking eighty- one steps, as Śiva Himself in Her essence.
śrīmātaṅge tathā dharmasaṃghātātmā śivo yataḥ | tathā tathā parāmarśaśakticakreśvaraḥ prabhuḥ | sthūlaikāśītipadajaparāmarśairvibhāvyate | tata eva parāmarśo yāvatyekaḥ samāpyate |	As Śiva has been regarded in the Mātanga śāstra as the essence of all factors sustaining the spectrum of the reality, so has been considered His Force of Contemplation. Siva Himself, thus, is the Lord of the entire spectrum Essence of Time As eighty-one is the number of syllables in tangible form, so is the number of the forms of contemplation.
tāvattatpadamuktaṃ no suptiṅinayamayantritam | ekāśītipadodāravimarśakramabṛṃhitaḥ |	Thus the numbering of the syllables as given here is by no means based on the grammatical rule of division of words into those ending in sup and tin terminations.
aṅguleṣviti ṣaṭtriṃśatyekāśītipadodayaḥ |	-a This tangible way of self-dissolution via contemplation on eighty-one syllables is of transcendental nature.
aṅgule navabhāgena vibhakte navamāṃśakāḥ | vedā mātrārdhamanyattu dvicatuḥṣaḍguṇaṃ trayam| evamaṅgularandhrāṃśacatuṣkadvayagaṃ laghu |	b-a In the entire range of thirty-six finger-ends of movement of breath in the human body, the number of half a mora at each nine steps at interval of four each would be eighty-one, resulting in the rise of as many steps. b-a On each one of the thirty-six finger-ends of the movement of breath having been divided into nine parts, the number of parts would come up to three hundred and twenty-four.
dīrghaṃ plutaṃ kramāddvitriguṇamardhaṃ tato'pi hala |	There get formed also thirty-six points of emergence on account of involvement of short, long and extra-long pluta sounds numbering six, twelve and eighteen respectively.
kṣakārastryardhamātrātmā mātrikaḥ sa tathāntarā | viśrāntāvardhamātrāsya tasmiṃstu kalite sati | aṅgulārdhe'dribhāgena tvardhamātrā purā punaḥ |	b-a Thus, the gaps created among parts of the finger-ends numbering eight on consideration of the short, long and extra-long range in their pronunciation including that of the consonant come up to eighty-one. b-a The sound ks consists of three and half a mora. With the addition of these to eighty-one, the number goes up to eighty-four.
kṣakāra sarvasaṃyogagrahaṇātmā tu sarvagaḥ | sarvavarṇodayādyantasandhiṣūdayabhāgvibhuḥ |	The sound ks encompasses all the consonants. As such, it is all-pervading. It encompasses all letters from beginning to end and subsists on points of their combination.
itthaṃ ṣaṭtriṃśake cāre varṇānāmudayaḥ phale | krūre saumye vilomena hādi yāvadapaścimam |	b- It is in the movement of the breath in this length of thirty-six finger-ends that lies the origin of letters. The experiences are both harsh and mild. The range of sounds extends from a to h.
hṛdyakāro dvādaśānte hakārastadidaṃ viduḥ | ahamātkamadvaitaṃ yaḥ prakāśātmaviśramaḥ |	The sound a emerges from the heart while h from the dvādaśānta. It is from this span that arises the monistic sense of aham, I, which is the abode of the Light of consciousness.
śivaśaktyavibhāgena mātraikāśītikā tviyam | dvāsaptatāvaṅguleṣu dviguṇatvena saṃsaret | |	This entire group of eighty-one sounds keeps moving in the twofold way in this span of seventy-two finger-ends with the combined action of the bindu representing Siva and nāda standing for the Śakti.
uktaḥ sūkṣmodayastraidhaṃ dvidhoktastu parodayaḥ | atha sthūlodayo'rṇānāṃ bhaṇyate guruṇoditaḥ |	Essence of Time Following deliberation on these kinds of subtle emanation of sound and two kinds of the transcendent, now is going to be discussed the tangible emanation as has been communicated by the teacher.
ekaikamardhapraharaṃ dine vargāṣṭakodayaḥ | rātrau ca hrāsavṛddhyatra kecidāhurna ke'pi tu |	As such, yogic practice needs to be carried on one group of sounds in each triad of hours in the entire duration of day and night. Some of the practitioners have talked about lengthening and shortening in the practice but not all.
eṣa vargodayo rātrau divā cāpyardhayāmagaḥ | prāṇatrayodaśaśatī pañcāśadadhikā ca sā |	Within one and a half sankrānti the number of breaths one takes is counted at one thousand, three hundred and fifty.
aghyardhā kila saṃkrāntirvarge varge divāniśo| tadaikye tūdayaścāraśatānāṃ saptaviṃśatiḥ | nava vargāṃstu ye prāhusteṣāṃ prāṇaśatī ravīn vi	b Śrī Tantrāloka Those who assert that the groups of letters are nine instead of eight, as per their view, each group of letters would require one thousand and two hundred breaths. In the entire duration of a day and night consisting of eighteen sections in a way as well, the number of breaths would be the same twenty-one thousand and six hundred.
aharniśaṃ tadaikye tu śatānāṃ śruticakṣuṣī | sthūlo vargodayaḥ so'yamathārṇodaya ucyate |	-a This is the deliberation on the gross group of sounds. Now is going to be talked about the emanation of sounds.
ekaikavarṇe prāṇānāṃ dviśataṃ ṣoḍaśādhikam | bahiścaṣakaṣaṭtriṃśaddina itthaṃ tathā niśi |	b On each one of the sounds, there occur two hundred and sixteen prānic movements. Caşakas of the day are thirty-six. The same number of them is of the night.
śatamaṣṭottaraṃ tatra raudraṃ śāktamathottaram | yāmalasthitiyoge tū rudraśaktayavibhāgitā | |	Emanation of sounds of the nature of Rudra is one hundred and eight while the rest are of the nature of Sakti. In view of the conjugal relationship between the two, there is no division in this matter.
dinarātryavibhāge tu dṛgvayabdhyasucāraṇā | sapañcamāṃśā nāḍī ca bahirvarṇodayaḥ smṛtaḥ |	During the day and night combined the count of prānic movement goes up to forty-three thousand and two hundred. This is apart from the count of sounds relating to seventy-two caşakas of nerves.
iti pañcāśikā seyaṃ varṇānāṃ paricarcitā| ekonāṃ ye tu tāmāhustanmataṃ saṃpracakṣmahe |	Essence of Time Thus has been deliberated the total group of fifty sounds. Now is going to be presented the view of those who count the sounds as less by one.
vedāścārāḥ pañcamāṃśanyūnaṃ cārārdhamekaśaḥ | varṇe'dhikaṃ tadviguṇamavibhāge divāniśoḥ | |	In case of admittance of only forty-nine sounds, these being multiplied by two hundred and sixteen would yield the total number of breaths in a day reduced to ten thousand five hundred and eighty-four, which being doubled to include the breaths of the night would be twenty-one thousand one hundred and sixty- eight.
sthūlo varṇodayaḥ so'yaṃ purā sūkṣmo nigadyate |	Deliberation on gross origin of sounds having been completed, now is going to be discussed their subtle origin.
iti kālatattvamuditaṃ śāstramukhāgamanijānubhavasiddham| = = = = = ;	Thus has been explained the essence of time in keeping with the scriptures, tradition and experience of oneself.
hai atha paramarahasyo'yaṃ cakrāṇāṃ bhaṇyate'bhyudayaḥ |	There are ayanas in a year which has six seasons.
ityayatnajamākhyātaṃ yatnajaṃ tu nigadyate | bījapiṇḍātmakaṃ sarvaṃ saṃvidaḥ spandanātmatām | vidadhatparasaṃvittāvupāya iti varṇitam | yathāraghaṭṭacakrāgraghaṭīyantraughavāhanam |	Whatever has been talked about in this regard is about what is effortless. As distinct from that, now is being talked about what is a product of effort. All is a mass of sheer seed which has assumed the shape of vibration of consciousness meant for culmination as a device to lead to the state of the supernal consciousness. The analogy in this regard is ghati-yantra.
ekānusaṃdhiyatyena citraṃ yantrodayaṃ bhajet | ekānusaṃdhānabalājjāte mantrodaye'niśam |	-a Sri Tantrāloka What happens in the ghati-yantra, is that there is a central wheel to which are tied a number of vessels one after the other through the entire wheel. By putting in effort on one mantra, the aspirant is required to shift to the next one.
tanmantradevatā yatnāttādātmyena prasīdati | khe rasaikākṣi nityotthe tadardhaṃ dvikapiṇḍake |	This process continues day and night with the consequence that the deity of the mantra gets eventually pleased and results in the aspirant finding out his identity with it.
trike sapta sahasrāṇi dviśatītyudayo mataḥ | catuṣke tu sahasrāṇi pañca caiva catuḥśatī |	b If the speed of breathing-in and out were to be reduced further to one-third of the original, the number would come down to , , to one-fourth, it would come down to ,.

If the speed were to be slowed down to the one-seventeenth, the number would come down to , and if to one-eighteenth, it would come down to If the speed were to be slowed down to the one-twenty-fourth, the number would come down to and if to one-twenty-seventh, it would come down to If the speed were to be slowed down to the one-thirty-second, the number would come down to and if to one-forty-eighth, it would get reduced to .
udayaṃ piṇḍayogajñaḥ piṇḍamantreṣu lakṣayet | catuṣpañcāśake cakre śatānāṃ tu catuṣṭayam |	The knower of the number of breaths should understand that on slowing down the speed to one-fifty-fourth, the number of breaths would come down to .

If the speed of the number of breaths were to be slowed down to the one- ninety-sixth, the number of breaths would come down to approximately . If the speed of the breath were to be slowed down to one hundred and eighth, the number of breaths would come down to . a Origin of Cakras and Process of Arousal If the number were to be multiplied six times by two, it would amount to ,.
tato'pi dviguṇe'ṣṭāṃśasyārdhamadhyardhamekakam | tato'pi sūkṣmakuśalairardhārdhādiprakalpane |	If each circle of breathing-in and breathing-out were divided further into sixteen parts, the number would grow up to , and if the same moments be further each be divided into two, the number would grow to ,.
bhāgaṣoḍaśakasthityā sūkṣmaścāro'bhilakṣyate | evaṃ prayatnasaṃruddhaprāṇacārasya yoginaḥ |	Thus on the yogin having deliberately controlled his breath to this extent, movement of the breath gets almost stopped. Complete stoppage of breath amounts to his having swallowed it which has been termed as the state of kāla-sankarsana.
krameṇa prāṇacārasya grāsa evopajāyate | prāṇagrāsakramāvāptakālasaṃkarṣaṇasthitiḥ | saṃvidekaiva pūrṇā syājjñānabhedavyapohanāt | tathā hi prāṇacārasya navasyānudaye sati | na kālabhedajanito jñānabheda prakalpate | saṃvedyabhedānna jñānaṃ bhinnaṃ śikharivṛttavat |	With elimination of the awareness of the diversity, there arises the awareness of the integrality of consciousness particularly in the event of absence of any fresh restart of breathing. Then here is little chance for the knowledge of the diversity to start as it is based on the awareness of difference in time. -a Difference in the object of knowledge cannot be imputed to difference in the knowledge itself, as is the case of roofs of houses serving as the basis of the unity of the town.
kālastu bhedakastasya sa tu sūkṣma kṣaṇo mataḥ | saukṣmyasya cāvadhirjñānaṃ yāvattiṣṭhati sa kṣaṇaḥ |	b Time is the factor of division while moment is the factor responsible for division in time. Knowledge is the limit of the subtlety of the thing concerned while moment is the limit of that knowledge.
anyathā na sa nirvaktuṃ nipuṇairapi pāryate | jñānaṃ kiyadbhavettāvattadabhāvo na bhāsate | tadabhāvaśca no tāvadyāvattatrākṣavartmani | arthe vātmapradeśe vā na saṃyogavibhāgitā |	Otherwise, end of the moment and beginning of another one is not capable of being decided by even minute observers. Howsoever minute may be the observation, non-existence of anything remains imperceptible. Knowledge of the object does not become non-existent till the object lies in the line of its perception. There is neither contact nor absence of contact between the object and the self.
sā cedudayate spandamayī tatprāṇagā dhruvam | bhavedeva tataḥ prāṇaspandābhāve na sā bhavet |	As events of contact and separation depend on throb, they are necessarily related to the life-force, prāna. In the absence of the throb of force, they would become impossible.
tadabhāvānna vijñānābhāvaḥ saivaṃ ta saiva dhīḥ | tu na cāsau vastuyo dīrghā kālabhedavyapohanāt |	To think of dhi, intellect, as something extensive is improper, as it lies beyond the access of time. Really, this is why consciousness lies beyond the reach of time.
vastuto hyata eveyaṃ kālaṃ savinna saṃspṛśet | ata ekaiva saṃvittirnānārūpe tathā tathā |	As such, one and the same consciousness appears in different forms at different places and on different occasions.
vindānā nirvikalpāpi vikalpo bhāvagocare | spandāntaraṃ na yāvattaduditaṃ tāvadeva saḥ |	Even though optionless in itself, consciousness appears as optional in the sensible world and continues to remain there until another throb does not arise.
tāvāneko vikalpa syādvividhaṃ vastu kalpayan| ye tvitthaṃ na vidusteṣāṃ vikalpo nopapadyate |	In the event of only one option, there may be ideation of several objects. Those who do not understand like this, for them there is no possibility of option.
sa yeko na bhavetkaścit trijagatyapi jātucit | śabdārūṣaṇayā jñānaṃ vikalpaḥ kila kathyate | sā ca syātkramikaivetthaṃ kiṃ kathaṃ ko vikalpayet | ghaṭa ityapi neyānsyādvikalpaḥ kā kathā sthitau |	As a matter of fact, it is the understanding of a particular object given the verbal form and not the object in itself is such which is characterised by them as an option. That wrong notion about the object needs to be understood as owing to involvement of graduality rather than simultaneity in the pronunciation of any particular word and much more so in the utterance of a sentence . The word ghata, pitcher, may be taken to exemplify the statement.
na vikalpaśca ko'pyasti yo mātrāmātraniṣṭhitaḥ | na ca jñānasamūho'sti teṣāmayugapatsthiteḥ |	There is no option, whatsoever, which may have stayed even for a second nor is there any stock of knowledge which may be staying simultaneously according to the Buddhist theory of momentariness.
tenāstaṅgata evaiṣa vyavahāro vikalpajaḥ | tasmātspandāntaraṃ yāvannodiyāttāvadekakam |	Thus, on admittance of the theory of momentariness the entire practicability of behaviour collapses. There is no possibility of arousal of another throb until the earlier one gives way to it by disappearing itself.
vijñānaṃ tadvikalpātmadharmakoṭīrapi spṛśet | ekāśītipadodāraśaktyāmarśātmakastataḥ |	One and the same item of cognition has the possibility of covering several instances of cognition. This is why contemplation has been characterised as comprehensive enough to be possessed of eighty-one forces.
vikalpaḥ śivatādāyī pūrvameva nirūpataḥ | yathā karṇau nartayāmītyevaṃ yatnāttathā bhavet | cakracāragatādyatnāttadvattaccakragaiva dhīḥ | japahomārcanādīnāṃ prāṇasāmyamato vidhiḥ |	It has already been elucidated how option has the possibility of leading to Siva- Origin of Cakras and Process of Arousal hood. This is possible owing to effort at that end like the yogins' practice of mobilising the ears or indeed any such part of the body, which normally is quite impossible otherwise. As it happens in course of prānāyāma, that the attention of the practitioner moves throughout the entire course of the breath including the prāna and apāna with the end of reaching the point of equanimity, even so in all processes of muttering of mantras, offering of oblation to fire and chanting of prayers, etc., what is aimed at is to arrive at the point of equanimity of breath, prāna.
siddhāmate kuṇḍalinīśaktiḥ prāṇasamonmanā | uktaṃ ca yoginīkaule tadetatparameśinā |	It has been characterised from the viewpoint of the Siddhā-yogiśvari as the kundalini śakti equivalence of breath as also as the state of silence of the mind.
padamantrākṣare cakre vibhāgaṃ śaktitattvagam | padeṣu kṛtvā mantrajño japādau phalabhāgbhavet |	It has been stated in the same text that one who is conversant with the secret of mantra very well knows how one can have the result of japa of mantras by mobilising the breath as per the order of each and every syllable of the mantra representing the force vested in it and thus throughout the entire mantra.
dvitrisaptāṣṭasaṃkhyātaṃ lopayecchatikodayam | iti śaktisthitā mantrā vidyā va cakranāyakāḥ |	Suggestion is that the practitioner needs to stop breathing following utterance of each two, three, seven and eight syllables of the mantra until the arousal of the force vested in them accordingly.
padapiṇḍasvarūpeṇa jñātvā yojyāḥ sadā priye | nityodaye mahātattve udayasthe sadāśive |	While muttering mantras, O Dear, the aspirant needs to associate each stipulated group of syllables in its essence with the great essence which is ever- present in an aroused state there and is known as Sadāśiva.
ayuktāḥ śaktimārge tu na japtāścodayena ye | te na siddhyanti yalena japtā koṭiśatairapi | mālāmantreṣu sarveṣu mānaso japa ucyate | upāṃśurvā śaktyudayaṃ teṣāṃ na parikalpayet |	Those practitioners of mantra - yoga particularly under the devotion to Sakti who are not self-controlled and are practising the japa without any attempt at arousal of the force vested in the mantra, they do never succeed in getting any result notwithstanding doing the japa effortlessly even hundreds of crores in number. Mānasa japa, mental repetition of mantras, is the proper way in regard to mantra-yoga particularly when it is being performed with the aid of a rosary.
padamantreṣu sarveṣu yāvattatpadaśaktigam | śakyate satataṃ yuktaistāvajjapyaṃ tu sādhakaiḥ | tāvatī teṣu vai saṃkhyā padeṣu padasaṃjñitā| tāvantamudayaṃ kṛtvā tripadoktyāditaḥ kramāt |	Out of two kinds of mantras, i.e. bija-mantra and pada-mantra in regard to pada-mantras of all kinds, aspirants need to keep continued japa, muttering, until they have access to the force vested in it. Origin of Cakras and Process of Arousal Mantras are given name after the number of words they consist of. From their beginning they need to be divided into three parts as it happens in the initial one of the mantras, that is, the gāyatri.
dvādaśākhye dvādaśite cakre sārdhaṃ śataṃ bhavet | ṣoḍaśākhye dvādaśite dvānavatyadhike śate | | cārārdhena samaṃ proktaṃ śataṃ dvādaśakādhikam | ṣoḍaśākhye ṣoḍaśite bhaveccaturaśītigaḥ |	If the mantra of twelve syllables were to be multiplied by twelve, the result would be one hundred and forty-four. If the same number were fifty, the result would be the same as the number of hours of day and night. If a mantra of sixteen syllables were to be multiplied by twelve, the result would by one hundred ninety-two. If the total number of breaths in a day and night were to be divided by this figure, the outcome would be one hundred and twelve while the remainder would be ninety-two.
ṣoḍaśākhye ṣoḍaśite bhaveccaturaśītigaḥ | udayo dviśataṃ taddhi ṣaṭpañcāśatsamuttaram |	If a mantra of sixteen syllables were to be multiplied by sixteen, the product would be two hundred and fifty-six. If the total number of breaths were to be divided by this figure, the quotient would be eighty-four.
cārāṣṭabhāgāṃstrīnatra kathayantyadhikānbudhāḥ | aṣṭāṣṭake dvādaśite pādārdhaṃ viṃśatiṃ vasūn | udayaḥ saptaśatikā sāṣṭā ṣaṣṭiryato hi saḥ | eṣa cakrodayaḥ proktaḥ sādhakānāṃ hitāvahaḥ | |	Eight multiplied by eight, the product would be sixty-four. Being again multiplied by twelve, the product would be seven hundred and sixty-eight. If this number were to divide the total daily number of prānic movements, the quotient would be twenty-eight while the remainder would be ninety-six. -a Thus has been indicated the way to arousal of cakras which is useful for practitioners of yoga.
nirūddhya mānasīrvṛttīścakre viśrāntimāgataḥ | vyutthāya yāvadviśrāmyettāvaccārodayo hyayam |	b Having stopped mental modulations and arrived at the point of rest on the cakra, while the aspirant remains in the state of rest, the process of breathing continues in him.
pūrṇe samudaye tvatra praveśaikātmyanirgamāḥ | traya ityata evoktaḥ siddhau madhyodaya varaḥ |	With full restoration of the prānic movement, entrance, unification and coming out, these three actions take place and hence this state of things is considered as higher than that of sheer entrance.
ādyantodayanirmuktā madhyamodayasaṃyutāḥ | mantravidyācakragaṇāḥ siddhibhājo bhavanti hi |	Those who have got free of the task of entrance and return, and have become one with the intermediate state as a result of their efficiency in the sādhanā of the circle of mantras, they decidedly make themselves deserve proficiency, siddhi.
mantracakrodayajñastu vidyācakrodayārthavit | kṣipraṃ siddhayediti prokta śrīmadviśatike trike |	It has been observed also in Vimśatika Trika that he, who has become conversant with the method of arousal of the circle of mantras as also with the significance of the arousal of the circle of vidyā, needs to attain siddhi without any delay.
dvistriścaturvā mātrābhirvidyāṃ vā cakrameva vā | tattvodayayutaṃ nityaṃ pṛthagbhūtaṃ japetsadā | | piṇḍākṣarapadairmantramekaikaṃ śaktitattvagam | bahvakṣarastu yo mantro vidyā vā cakrameva vā | | śaktisthaṃ naiva taṃ tatra vibhāgastvoṃ namontagaḥ | asmiṃstattvodaye tasmādahorātrastriśastriśaḥ |	Origin of Cakras and Process of Arousal A would-be yogin at the initial stage of his practice of yoga needs to practise japa on vidyā or cakra on two, three or four-syllabic mantras regularly and separately trying to arouse the power embedded in them, no matter, in groups of syllables, letters or words. Irrespective of the fact whether there be a mantra, vidyā or cakra, one should not strain on lengthy ones nor should he break them into parts beyond om namo. -a In this process of arousal of the essence, the ahorātra, day and night combined, representing the prānic forces, prāna and apāna, each covering thirty-six finger- ends, the practitioner needs to make three parts of twelve finger-ends each dedicated to entry, unification and exit with respect to both of them, that is, prāna and apāna.
vibhajyate vibhāgaśca punareva triśastriśa | pūrvodaye tu viśramya dvitīyenollasedyā |	b-a Beginning with the breathing-in at the first step, the practitioner needs to rest within himself at the second step followed by exit at the third.
viśeccārdhārdhikāyogāttadoktārdhodayo bhavet | yadā pūrṇodayātmā tu samaḥ kālastrike sphuret | praveśaviśrāntyullāse syātsvatryaṃśodayastadā | ityeṣa kālavibhavaḥ prāṇa eva pratiṣṭhitaḥ |	This would result in the interpenetration of the prāņa and the apāna. With the access of the apāna in the form of the moon to the half-monthly state, time would be equally divided among all the three states, that is, entry, subsistence and exit. b-a Thus the entire spectrum of time is based on prāna as also on apāna while the latter itself has its base in the throb and the latter in the space of consciousness showing the entire world's axis in it.
sa spande khe sa taccityāṃ tenāsyāṃ viśvaniṣṭhitiḥ | ataḥ saṃvitpratiṣṭhānau yato viśvalayodayau |	b-a Thus since emergence and dissolution both have their axis in consciousness while traversing the path of sakti in Her innumerable throbs, they both are real and substantial.
śaktyante'dhvani tatspandāsaṃkhyātā vāstavī tataḥ | uktaṃ śrīmālinītantre gātre yatraiva kutracit |	b-a It has been observed in the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra that in whichsoever part of the body there may arise some sort of peculiar reaction; that should be welcomed as indicatory of something essential on the spiritual plane.
vikāra upajāyate tattattvaṃ tattvamuttamam| prāṇe pratiṣṭhitaḥ kālastadāviṣṭā ca yattanuḥ |	b-a Time has its basis in prāna while the body also is dependent on it. Therefore, that form of it has been deliberated upon which lies in the body.
sā nāḍīrūpatāmetya dehaṃ saṃtānayedimam | śrīsvacchande'ta evoktaṃ yathā parṇaṃ svatantubhiḥ | | vyāptaṃ tadvattanurdvāradvāribhāvena nāḍibhiḥ |	Having assumed the form of the nerves this tendency threads the entire body. b-a Origin of Cakras and Process of Arousal It has been stated in the Svacchanda Tantra that as a leaf is pervaded by its veins, even so the body is pervaded by its nerves of both kinds - main and their branches.
pādāṅguṣṭhādikordhvasthabrahmakuṇḍalikāntaḥ | |	b-a Beginning from the toe, etc., of the body up to the upper point of the kundalini, the entire span of the body is eighty-four finger-ends.
kāla samastaścaturaśītāvevāṅguleṣvitaḥ | dvādaśāntāvadhiṃ kiṃcitsūkṣmakālasthitiṃ viduḥ | | ṣaṇṇavatyāmadhaḥ ṣaḍvikramāccāṣṭottaraṃ śatam | atra madhyamasaṃcāriprāṇodayalayāntare | |	This span is understood to extend by twelve finger-ends on the upper side and twelve finger-ends below making thus the whole span of the body up to one hundred and eight finger- ends. b-a It is within the limits of this span that the prānic force operates from the start up to its end. Curiously enough, they represent in a miniature form the states of creation and dissolution on the universal scale with the operation of air going on in-between the two events.
viśve sṛṣṭilayāste tu citrā vāyvantarakramāta | ityeṣa sūkṣmaparimarśanaśīlanīya ścakrodayo'nubhavaśāstradṛśā mayoktaḥ |	b-a Thus has been expounded by me the process of arousal of the cakra on the basis of my personal experience as substantiated by the scriptural evidence in all its subtlety and hence deserves to be contemplated on.
deśādhvano'pyatha samāsavikāsayogāt | saṅgīyate vidhirayaṃ śivaśāstradṛṣṭaḥ |	b Herewith is going to be deliberated succinctly and in detail the mode of approach to the principles of space and way to its access as envisioned in the Saivite literature.
vicārito'yaṃ kālādhvā kriyāśaktimayaḥ prabhoḥ | mūrtivaicitryajastajjo deśādhvātha nirūpyate |	We have already discussed the time-feature of the Lord which is of the form of action. Since His spatial aspect is of the nature of form, as a product of the temporal, it is being elucidated here.
adhvā samasta evāyaṃ cinmātre saṃpratiṣṭhitaḥ | yattatra nahi viśrānta tannabhaḥ kusumāyate |	Since this spatial feature of Him is based completely on sheer consciousness, wherever there is absence of consciousness, there is only delusion.
saṃviddvāreṇa tatsṛṣṭe śūnye dhiyi marutsu ca | nāḍīcakrānucakreṣu bahirdehe'dhvasaṃsthitiḥ |	Since the path, as the spatial feature of creation, along with the state of non- being, sūnya, intellect and prānic forces, have been created by consciousness, it lies outside the body spreading in the form of circuits of nerves, main and branches.
tatrādhvaivaṃ nirūpyo'yaṃ yatastatprakriyākramam| anusaṃdadhadeva drāg yogī bhairavatāṃ vrajet |	Here the path itself needs to be elucidated as through travel on it the yogin may attain the state of Bhairava forthwith.
didṛkṣayaiva sarvārthān yadā vyāpyāvatiṣṭhate | tadā kiṃ bahunoktena ityuktaṃ spandaśāsane |	It has been stated in the Spanda śāstra that when the aspirant takes the position of sheer curiosity to understand the mystery of everything by way of complete oneness with his object, the result becomes obvious by itself requiring none to tell him anything about it.
jñātvā samastamadhvānaṃ tadīśeṣu vilāpayet | tān dehaprāṇadhīcakre pūrvavadgālayetkramāt |	Having understood the path in all its components, the aspirant needs to dissolve them in their Lords and the later themselves in the circle of body, prāna and intellect, respectively as done earlier.
tatsamastaṃ svasaṃvittau sā saṃvidbharitātmikā | upāsyamānā saṃsārasāgarapralayānalaḥ |	Bearing all these dissolved in itself, the consciousness being well contemplated acts as the fire of dissolution with respect to the occan of the world.
śrīmaddīkṣottare caitānadhveśān gururabravīt | brahmānantātpradhānāntaṃ viṣṇuḥ puṃsaḥ kalāntagam | rudro granthau ca māyāyāmīśa sādākhyagocare | anāśritaḥ śivastasmādvyāptā tadvyāpakaḥ paraḥ |	- Deśādhva - Manifestation of Consciousness in Terms... My teacher has written in his book titled Diksottara that Brahmā pervades from ananta to pradhāna, Visnu from the individual up to kalā, Rudra the complex of māyā, Anāśrita Siva from śuddha vidyā up to Sadāśiva and Supreme Siva the Sakti.
evaṃ śivatvamāpannamiti matvā nyarūpyata| na prakriyāparaṃ jñānamiti svacchandaśāsane |	- Having admitted this proposition as the way to attainment of the state of Siva, the Svacchanda Tantra has observed that there is no other path convenient this one.
triśira śāsane bodho mūlamadhyāgrakalpitaḥ | ṣaṭtriṃśattattvasaṃrambhaḥ smṛtirbhedavikalpanā |	In the book Trisira Bhairava, the tree of right understanding has been conceived in all its parts, namely, the root, the stem and the top in the form of the knowledge of the thirty-six components of the system along with the individual’s outlook towards them vis-a-vis of this entire spectrum of the world.
bodhamadhyaṃ bhavetkicidādhārādheyalakṣaṇam | tattvabhedavibhāgena svabhāvasthitilakṣaṇam |	This kind of understanding forms the root of the tree. The stem part of the tree would be the understanding that all this spectrum rests in me.
bodhāgraṃ tattu cidbodhaṃ nistaraṅga bṛhatsukham | saṃvidekātmatānītabhūtabhāvapurādikaḥ |	The top of the tree of understanding, as distinct from it, would lie in the awareness that it is the blissful state of unwavering of my consciousness itself which is all this, in all its diversification.
avyavacchinnasaṃvittibhairavaḥ parameśvaraḥ | śrīdevyā yāmale coktaṃ ṣaṭtriṃśattattvasundaram | adhvānaṃ ṣaḍvidhaṃ dhyāyansadyaḥ śivamayo bhavet | yadyapyamuṣya nāthasya saṃvittyanatirekiṇaḥ |	-a Lord Bhairava is the all-inclusive integral consciousness including the past, the present and the future in all their varieties of formation. b-a It has been stated in the Devi Yāmala Tantra that the aspirant has the possibility of getting filled with the essence of Siva immediately through contemplation on the sixfold path designed via awareness of the thirty-six steps of the cosmology.
pūrṇasyordhvādimadhyāntavyavasthā nāsti vāstavī | tathāpi pratipattṝṇāṃ pratipādayitustā | svasvarūpānusāreṇa madhyāditvādikalpanāḥ | tataḥ pramātṛsaṃkalpaniyamāt pārthivaṃ viduḥ |	b-a As the Lord is transcendent to consciousness besides being perfectly complete, any distinction in the form of upper, middle and lower in Him is not real.

Even on this presupposition, how is it that she could rise to such entities as the gunas which are so divergent among them without having become agitated. On acceptance of the state of agitation prior to the birth of the gunas, there would arise the defect.

It is in view of the apprehension of this defect that they are conceived as having been umanifest and their equilibrium being only togetherness and not anything else.

Since the idea of guna is incapable of bearing out in it that of causality, it is better to characterise the action as simply another agitation as is the case with the seed remaining the same even after it gets swelled and germinates.

atha tattvapravibhāgo vistarataḥ kathyate kramaprāptaḥ |	* Source Wikipedia CHAPTER - Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Now is going to be expounded in detail classification of the Reality as such.
yānyuktāni purāṇyamūni vividhairbhedairyadeṣvanvitam | rūpaṃ bhāti paraṃ prakāśaniviḍaṃ devaḥ sa ekaḥ śivaḥ | tatsvātantryarasātpunaḥ śivapadādbhede vibhāte param | yadrūpaṃ bahudhānugāmi tadidaṃ tattvaṃ vibhoḥ śāsane | tathāhi kālasadanādvīrabhadrapurāntagam | dhṛtikāṭhinyagarimādyavabhāsāddharātmatā |	Under the control of the all-pervading Lord, the essential reality, that phase of Him which appears as the common being of Himself appears as different from Him owing to His exercise of autonomy out of His experience of delight in it. This gets elucidated by the denomination of the earth as dharā as used to indicate to the entire creation beginning from time to Virabhadra owing to the prevalence of the qualities of constancy, solidity and majesty, etc., in it.
evaṃ jalāditattveṣu vācyaṃ yāvatsadāśive | svasminkārye'tha dharmaudhe yadvāpi svasadṛgguṇe |	So needs to be said in regard to the entire creation beginning from water up to Sadāśiva with respect to one's own action, rules of conduct and common attributes of fluidity, transparency, etc..
āste sāmānyakalpena tananādvyāptṛbhāvataḥ | tattatvaṃ kramaśaḥ pṛthvīpradhānaṃ puṃśivādayaḥ |	As the word tattva, meaning essence, is derived from the root tan, to spread, is reflective normally of its pervasiveness, it becomes considered as pre-eminently of the nature of the earth beginning from the individual up to Siva and indeed from the individual bodies up to creations as a whole.
dehānāṃ bhuvanānāṃ ca na prasaṅgastato bhavet | śrīmanmataṅgaśāstrādau taduktaṃ parameśinā |	This has been stated as such by Lord Śiva Himself in texts like Matanga śāstra, etc.
tatraiṣāṃ darśyate dṛṣṭaḥ siddhayogīśvarīmate| kāryakāraṇabhāvo yaḥ śivecchāparikalpitaḥ | vastutaḥ sarvabhāvānāṃ karteśānaḥ paraḥ śivaḥ | asvatantrasya kartṛtvaṃ nahi jātūpapadyate |	- The causal relationship which has been conceived out of the desire of Siva, according to Siddha-Yogiśvari Tantra is being elucidated here for the sake of wellbeing of the followers In fact, it is Lord Śiva Himself who is the creator of all whatever is in existence, as it is illogical to conceive of the Creator as an agent who is not autonomous.
svataṃtratā ca cinmātravapuṣaḥ parameśituḥ | svatantraṃ ca jaḍaṃ ceti tadanyonyaṃ virudhyate |	Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Autonomy in the ultimate sense is possible only of the Supreme Lord as embodied in the form of pure consciousness as autonomy and inanimateness are self-contradictory.
jāḍyaṃ pramātṛtantratvaṃ svātmasiddhimapi prati | na kartṛtvādṛte cānyat kāraṇatvaṃ hi lakṣyate |	Inanimateness stands in need of the knower for even its self-being. There is no possibility of causality in the absence of the doer. Causality requires admittance of the formula that effect would follow the presence of the cause.
tasminsati hi tadbhāva ityapekṣaikajīvitam| nirapekṣeṣu bhāveṣu svātmaniṣṭhatayā katham |	In view of this formulation, how can there be causality amongst factors which do not require one another for their being ? The state of priority and posteriority between the cause and the effect lies in the fact that what was implicit in the cause becomes explicit in the effect.
bījamaṅkura ityasmin satattve hetutadvatoḥ | ghaṭa paṭaśceti bhavet kāryakāraṇatā na kim | bījamaṅkurapatrāditayā pariṇameta cet| atatsvabhāvavapuṣaḥ sa svabhāvo na yujyate | sa tatsvabhāva iti cet tarhi bījāṅkurau nije| tāvatyeva na viśrāntau tadanyātyantasaṃbhavāt |	Admittance of causality between two factors depends on the fact that the effect has essentially the same properties which are present in the cause and nothing else. If we admit causality between such two entities as the seed and the sprout, why is that the same is not admissible between the pitcher and the cloth? If the seed transforms itself in the shape of the sprout and the leaf, etc., it does not accord well with its inherent nature. If the sprout in its nature is the same as it inherits from its cause, that is, the seed, it ought to have the possibility of reverting back to its form of the seed and thus the seed having had the possibility of remaining always in its original form.
tataśca citrākāro'sau tāvānkaścit prasajyate | astu cet na jaḍe'nyonyaviruddhākārasaṃbhavaḥ|	That possible agent must be an artist, without the involvement of whom, there is no possibility of the inanimate taking by itself shapes quite different from its original one.
krameṇa citrākāro'stu jaḍaḥ kiṃ nu viruddhyate | kramo'kramo vā bhāvasya na svarūpādhiko bhavet | tathopalambhāmātraṃ tā upalambhaśca kiṃ tatthā | upalabdhāpi vijñānasvabhāvo yo'sya so'pi hi |	What is the harm in admitting the artist as the inanimate Nature itself which shapes and reshapes objects in course of time differently ? In response to this suggestion, what needs to be stated is that no matter, the case be of going ahead or reverting back, the effect ought not to transgress its inherent nature. It is a matter of secondary significance whether the object is viewed in its causal shape or that of the effect.
kramopalambharūpatvāt krameṇopalabheta cet | tasya tarhi kramaḥ ko'sauḥ tadanyānupalambhataḥ | svabhāva iti cennāsau svarūpādadhiko bhavet | svarūpānadhikasyāpi kramasya svasvabhāvataḥ |	- Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality As regards the question of the involvement of graduality in the perception of the object as cause and effect, the objection concerned becomes meaningless in view of the fact that while the object concerned is in its causal form it does not exist in the form of the effect and when it has assumed the form of the effect, no more it is there in its causal form.
svātantryādbhāsanaṃ syāccet kimanyad brūmahe vayam| itthaṃ śrīśiva evaikaḥ karteti paribhāṣyate |	If it is assumed that shaping and reshaping of things is owing to the autonomy of the shaper, we have nothing to say against it, as it coincides with our own view according to which Śiva alone is the doer of all whatever.
kartṛtvaṃ caitadetasya tathāmātrāvabhāsanam| tathāvabhāsanaṃ cāsti kāryakāraṇabhāvagam |	If this assumption be considered as being limited only to that kind of look, that look ought to be taken as applicable to the causal form of things as well as to their form of the effect.
yathā hi ghaṭasāhityaṃ paṭasyāpyavabhāsate| tathā ghaṭānantaratā kiṃ tu sā niyamojjhitā |	If the question be that as it is the case with the parity of the seed and the sprout, the same parity exists in look between the jar and the cloth also and hence here, too, causality must be admitted.
ato yanniyamenaiva yasmādābhātyanantaram| tattasya kāraṇaṃ brūmaḥ sati rūpānvaye'dhike |	Therefore, we admit causality between two such objects only when the effect follows from the cause with the continuity of the inherent nature of the former in it, irrespective of divergence of form.
niyamaśca takṣārūpabhāsanāmātrasārakaḥ | bījādaṅkura ityevaṃ bhāsanaṃ nahi sarvadā | yogīcchānantarodbhūtatathābhūtāṅkuro yataḥ | iṣṭe tathāvidhākāre niyamo bhāsate yataḥ |	The principle applicable in this case of admittance of causality is that there needs to appear like this that is, sequence of appearance and inherence of nature. Otherwise, although generally, but not necessarily, it is true that the sprout grows out of the seed. This can be elucidated by the instance of a sprout arising out of the wish of a yogin but exactly of the same shape and form as one arising out of a particular seed and thus in keeping with the law of causality in appearance.
svapne ghaṭapaṭādīnāṃ hetutadvatsvabhāvatā | bhāsate niyamenaiva bādhāśūnyena tāvati |	Till and to that extent, the law of identity of nature holds good without any obstruction between two objects, the law of causality between them needs to be admitted.
tathābhūte ca niyame hetutadvattvakāriṇi | vastutaścinmayasyaiva hetutā taddhi sarvagam |	Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality In view of this principle holding good as the cause of this kind of principle prevailing in the mutual relationship of those objects, efficacy of the all-pervading consciousness as the cause of that kind of relationship has to be admitted as a verity.
ata eva ghaṭodbhūtau sāmagrī heturucyate | sāmagrī ca samagrāṇāṃ yadyekaṃ neṣyate vapuḥ | hetubhedānna bhedaḥ syāt phale taccāsamañjasam| yadyasyānuvidhatte tāmanvayavyatirekitām |	If the diversity of factors involved in forming its cause is treated as not one, it ought to result in the production of so may jars in one act of production which obviously does not happen. -a The thing which serves as a favourable factor in the causality of anything to the extent of the effect being produced with the involvement of it and not getting turned out in the absence of it, needs to be regarded as its cause.
tattasya hetu cetso'yaṃ kuṇṭhatarko na naḥ priyaḥ | samāgrāśca yathā vaṇḍasūtracakrakarādayaḥ | dūrāśca bhāvinaścetthaṃ hetutveneti manmahe | yadi tatra bhavenmerurbhaviṣyanviāpi kaścana | na jāyeta ghaṭo nūnaṃ tatpratyūhavyapohitaḥ | yathā ca cakraṃ niyate deśe kāle ca hetutām |	Any other deliberations on it are not to our liking. b-a We consider as factors of causality in the creation of a jar such things as the stick, the thread, the wheel and the hand of the potter, etc., no matter they may be effective in its creation from afar or even from the future. b-a If the mount Meru be one of such factors from the side of the spacial distance and another in the womb of future temporal, the jar is not going to be produced due to such an obstruction which is insurmountable.
yāti karkisumervādyāstadvatsvasthāvadhi sthitāḥ | tathā ca teṣāṃ hetūnāṃ saṃyojanaviyojane | niyate śiva evaikaḥ svatantraḥ kartṛtāmiyāt | kumbhakārasya yā saṃvit cakradaṇḍādiyojane |	b-a As the wheel proves its causality in the production of the jar by virtue of its presence at the definite place and time, even so may do the sign of Cancer and Sumeru, etc., in spite of being at their respective points in time and locus of space. b-a In the determination of the association as well as dissociation of the factors of causality like this, Siva alone needs to be admitted as the real cause in all His autonomy.
śiva eva hi sā yasmāt saṃvidaḥ kā viśiṣṭatā| kaumbhakārī tu saṃvittiravacchedāvabhāsanāt | bhinnakalpā yadi kṣepyā daṇḍacakrādimadhyataḥ| tasmādekaikanirmāṇe śivo viśvaikavigrahaḥ | karteti puṃsaḥ kartṛtvābhimāno'pi vibhoḥ kṛtiḥ| ata eva tathābhānaparamārthatayā sthiteḥ | |	b-a The consciousness operating from within the potter in the association of the wheel, the stick, etc., is the same as Siva Himself since there cannot be any specification in consciousness. b-a The sole difference between the two is that the consciousness of the potter appears as different from Siva as it appears from within the superimposition of arrangement of the wheel, etc. b-a From this difference, it needs to be understood that it is Śiva Himself who is the Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality creator of each and every individual and hence the egotism of the individual in claiming the creativity in favour of himself is, indeed, also a creation of the Lord Himself.
kāryakāraṇabhāvasya loke śāstre ca citratā | māyāto'vyaktakalayoriti rauravagrahe | |	b-a It is due to mistaking this appearance as the reality, there is diversity of viewpoint both in the world as well as in the Sāstra in regard to the law of causality.
śrīpūrve tu kalātattvādavyaktamiti kathyate | tata eva niśākhyānātkalībhūtādaliṅgakam |	b- a In text titled Rauravasangraha, it has been mentioned that the Unmanifest, avyakta and kalā have been born of Māyā while in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra it has been observed that the Unmanifest has been born of kalā.
iti vyākhyāsmadukte'smin sati nyāye'tiniṣphalā| loke ca gomayātkīṭāt saṃkalpātsvapnataḥ smṛteḥ |	Such explanations from our logical viewpoint are extremely fruitless. b-a As regards the popular convention, it is believed that from the cow dung is born a kind of scorpion which really is only a similitude of the scorpion.
yogīcchāto dravyamantraprabhāvādeśca vṛścikaḥ | anya eva sa cet kāmaṃ kutaścitsvaviśeṣataḥ |	Similar is the case with objects produced out of the exercise of will- power by the yogin as also owing to the effect of certain medicines, mantras, etc.
sa tu sarvatra tulyastatparāmarśaikyatasti tu | tata ṇva svarūpe'pi krame'pyanyādṛśī sthitiḥ | śāstreṣu yujyate citrāt tathābhāvasvabhāvataḥ | puṃrāgavitkalākālamāyā jñānottare kramāt |	Such products are actually not the same as the real ones but present only a similitude of them in certain respects. b- This kind of vagary is common to all such cases other than the real ones but appearing like them due to admixture of contemplative elements in discursive deliberations as well as in popular beliefs. In spite of lacking in verity, such accounts add to the fascination of the Sāstra.
niyatirnāsti vairiñce kalordhve niyatiḥ śrutā | puṃrāgavittrayādūrdhvaṃ kalāniyatisaṃpuṭam | kālo māyeti kathitaḥ krama kiraṇaśāstragaḥ| pumānniyatyā kālaśca rāgavidyākalānvitaḥ |	-a Purusa, Rāga, Vidyā, Kalā and Māyā have been placed in an order different from our own in the Sarva-jnānottara śāstra where Niyati does not exist at all while in view of Virañci, Niyati has been accorded a position above Kalā. In some accounts, the pair of Kalā and Niyati has been placed quite above the triad of Purusa, Rāga and Vidyā b- In the Kirana śāstra the position accorded to Kalā and Māyā is as under – The Purusa is associated with the Niyati while Kalā is related with Rāga, Vidyā and Kalā.
ityeṣa krama uddiṣṭo mātaṅge pārameśvare | kāryakāraṇabhāvīye tattve itthaṃ vyasthite | śrīpūrvaśāstre kathitāṃ vacmaḥ kāraṇakalpanām | śivaḥ svatantradṛgrūpaḥ pañcaśaktisunirbharaḥ |	-a Vis-a-vis these viewpoints held in other Sāstras in regard to the interrelationship between the cause and the effect, I am presenting here what has been stated in the pūrva Šāstra, that is, the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra in this regard. b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Śiva is the self-sufficient ultimate reality having five forces embedded in Him.
svātantryabhāsitabhidā pañcadhā pravibhajyate | cidānandeṣaṇājñānakriyāṇāṃ susphuṭatvataḥ | śivaśaktisadeśānavidyākhyaṃ tattvapañcakam | ekaikatrāpi tattve'smin sarvaśaktisunirbhare |	b-a It is due to clear distinctness of His five forces from one another, namely, cit, ānanda, esasnā, jñāna and kriyā consciousness, delight, wish, knowledge and action that the five grades of the Reality have got formed, namely, Siva, Sakti, Sadāśiva, Iśvara and Vidyā having in themselves distinguished by predominance of these forces each in them in the same order.
tattatprādhānyayogena sa sa bhedo nirūpyate | tathāhi svasvatantratvaparipūrṇatayā vibhuḥ |	b-a For instance, on account of His autonomous nature and self-sufficiency, Lord Siva appears in numberless multiplicity of forms in the world without any kind of division in Him.
niḥsaṃkhyairbahubhī rūpairbhātyavacchedavarjanāt | śāṃbhavāḥ śaktijā mantramaheśā mantranāyakāḥ | mantrā iti viśuddhāḥ syuramī pañca gaṇāḥ kramāt | svasminsvasmin gaṇe bhāti yadyadrūpaṃ samanvayi |	b-a On account of the grades of the Reality's distinctness from one another, these five groups of beings have got formed, namely, Sambhava, Saktija, Mantra- maheśa, Mantra-nāyaka and Mantra. Whatever gradient of the Reality has Śrī Tantrāloka become inherent predominantly in whatever grade of the same that has been considered as its reality in the same way as inherence of time, fire, etc.
tadeṣu tattvamityuktaṃ kālāgnyāderdharādivat | tena yatprāhurākhyānasādṛśyena viḍambitāḥ | gurūpāsāṃ vinaivāttapustakābhīṣṭadṛṣṭayaḥ| brahmā nivṛttyadhipatiḥ pṛthaktatvaṃ na gaṇyate |	b-a Those who have gained their favourable viewpoint out of study of some text without rendering any service to the teacher and thus without having had any inkling into the reality put up the objection fictitiously as to why is it that in spite of being the presiding deity of Nivrtti detachment Brahmā is not considered as a separate and essential being while Sadāśiva, etc.
sadāśivādyāstu pṛthag gaṇyanta iti ko nayaḥ | brahmaviṣṇuhareśānasuśivānāśritātmani | ṣaṭke kāraṇasaṃjñe'rdhajaratīyamiyaṃ kutaḥ | iti tanmūlato dhvastaṃ gaṇitaṃ nahi kāraṇam | | yathā pṛthivyadhipatirnṛpastattvāntaraṃ nahi | tathā tattatkaleśānaḥ pṛthak tattvāntaraṃ katham |	are considered so ? Why is it that Brahmā, Visnu, Hara, Isāna, Susiva and Anāśrita, these six divinities are not regarded as essential realities while Sadāśiva, etc., are regarded as such? What is the logic behind this kind of illogical contention that the half of the body of a particular person is old and the half is young ? b-a As against this objection, our answer is that the basis on which all this has been done is not any arithmetical logic of sheer repetition and analogy according to which the emperor of the earth also ought to be regarded as another essential factor in the formation of the earth.
tadevaṃ pañcakamidaṃ śuddho'dhvā paribhāṣyate | tatra sākṣācchivecchaiva karyābhāsitabhedikā |	b- As distinct from the arithmetical logic of mechanical repletion and that of fictional similitude this group of five entities has been associated with the pure Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality path of liberation, suddha addhvā, as the wish of Śiva Himself directly is the causal basis of distinction behind it.
īśvarecchāvaśakṣubdhabhogalolikacidgaṇān | saṃvibhaktumaghoreśaḥ sṛjatīha sitetaram | | aṇūnāṃ lolikā nāma niṣkarmā yābhilāṣitā | apūrṇamanyatājñānaṃ malaṃ sāvacchidojjhitā | yogyatāmātramevaitadbhāvyavacchedasaṃgrahe | malastenāsya na pṛthaktattvabhāvo'sti rāgavat |	In order to separate from the seekers of liberation those who crave for enjoyment in the world as per the wish of Lord, Aghoreśa has created the path of impurity. The desire of individuals known as lolikā, force of instability, which remained dormant and clouded by the ignorance of incompleteness and hence lies deserted so far, bears the potentiality of division as a malady and hence has not been considered, like attachment, as an essential factor in the structure of the Reality.
niravacchedakarmāṃśamātrāvacchedatastu sā | rāgaḥ puṃsi dhiyo dharmaḥ karmabhedavicitratā |	- The force of instability is a universal quality of action. In the individual it assumes the form of a quality of the intellect in the form of attachment, rāga, and serves as the cause of peculiarity in the action from individual to individual.
apūrṇamanyatā ceyaṃ tathārūpābhāsanam | svatantrasya śivasyecchā ghaṭarūpo yathā ghaṭaḥ |	It, too, is a product of the wish of Śiva of independent nature and has taken a separate form as it happens with the jar taking a separate form owing to the wish of the potter for the creation of it .
svātmapracchādanecchaiva vastubhūtastathā malaḥ |	The wish to cover one's real nature, Self assumes the form of the object and hence is considered as a malady.
yathaivāvyatiriktasya dharāderbhāvitātmatā |	b- a The non-separateness of the malady from the light of consciousness is unlike that of such tangible objects as cart, etc.
tathaivāsyeti śāstreṣu vyatiriktaḥ sthito malaḥ | vyatirikta svatantrastu na ko'pi śakaṭādivat | | tatsadvitīyā sāśuddhiḥ śivamuktāṇunā na kim | malasya rodhrī kāpyasti śaktiḥ sā cāpyamuktagā |	Now the question arises as to why is it that the force of malady is not considered as something other than the light of consciousness as also why is it that it does not become operative on individuals who have got liberated from the world and have become one with Śiva. In response to these queries the answer is that this force of malady is simply a certain force of obstruction affecting only those who have not been liberated.
iti nyāyojjhito vādaḥ śraddhāmātraikakalpitaḥ | rodhrī śaktirjaḍasyāsau svayaṃ naiva pravartate |	To think of it as other than this is a viewpoint illogical and fabricated out of sheer faith. b-a It is obvious that the force of obstruction cannot be operative by itself.
svayaṃ pravṛttau viśvaṃ syāttathā ceśanikā pramā| malasya rodhrīṃ tāṃ śaktimīśaścetsaṃyunakti tat | kīdṛśaṃ pratyaṇumiti praśne nāstyuttaraṃ vacaḥ | malaścāvaraṇaṃ tacca nāvāryasya viśeṣakam | |	b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality On acceptance of the viewpoint that this force of obstruction belongs to the Lord Himself and it is He who associates it with individuals, the question arises as to which kinds of individual does He associate it. This objection does not deserve to be responded to.
upalambhaṃ vihantyetadghaṭasyeva paṭāvṛtiḥ | malenāvṛtarūpāṇāmaṇūnāṃ yatsatattvakam | |	b-a What the force of obstruction does is only to ward the object concerned from the sight of its seeker without affecting the nature of the object itself. Example for it is the covering of a jar by a piece of cloth.
śiva eva ca tatpaśyettasyaivāsau malo bhavet | vibhorjñānakriyāmātrasārasyāṇugasya ca | tadabhāvo malo rūpadhvaṃsāyaiva prakalpate | dharmāddhirmiṇi yo bhedaḥ samavāyena caikatā |	The essential core of the individual hidden behind the malady is and remains the same as Śiva Himself and as such the malady cannot belong to anyone else but to the observer of it. b-a The Lord and the individual both are essentially configurations of consciousness and action while malady is nullification of these essential attributes in them and hence the cause of their disfiguration.
na tadbhavadbhiruditaṃ kaṇabhojanaśiṣyavat | nāmūrtena na mūrtena prāvarītuṃ ca śakyate | | jñānaṃ cākṣuṣaraśmīnāṃ tathābhāve saratyapi | sa eva ca malo mūrta kiṃ jñānena na vedyate |	b-a Responding to the objection of the opponent the author charges him with the remark that “You have not mentioned the point of difference of the quality from the qualified and subsequent integration of the two by some sort of coincidence, samavāya, as the followers of Kanāda hold." b-a Śrī Tantrāloka Consciousness can be obstructed neither by the tangible nor by the intangible unlike the rays of the eye.
sarvageṇa tataḥ sarvaḥ sarvajñatvaṃ na kiṃ bhajet yaśca dhvāntātprakāśasyāvṛtistatpratighātibhiḥ |	In any case, it remains operative. -a The opponent puts the question : Why is it that having become concrete the force of obstruction, being a malady, does not become an object of cognisance and on account of all-pervasiveness of consciousness, all do not become omniscient? b-a Since there is the relationship of opposition between light and darkness, darkness becomes effective in covering the light.
mūrtānāṃ pratighastejo'ṇūnāṃ nāmūrtaṃ īdṛśam | na ca cetanamātmānamasvatantro malaḥ kṣamaḥ |	This, however, is not the nature of relationship between consciousness and the force of obstruction. b-a As the ātman is the concentricity of consciousness with all its nature of independence, malady being dependent on something else, cannot be capable of covering it.
āvarītana vācyaṃ ca madyāvṛtinidarśam	The example of wine, etc.
uktaṃ bhavadbhirevetthaṃ jaḍa karttā nahi svayam |	b-a It has been observed by you yourself that anything inconscient cannot act as the doer by itself.
svatantrasyeśvarasyaitāḥ śaktayaḥ prerikāḥ kila | ataḥ karmavipākajñaprabhuśaktibaleritam | | madyaṃ sūte madaṃ duḥkhasukhamohaphalātmakam | na ceśapreritaḥ puṃso mala āvṛṇuyādyataḥ | |	Obviously, in such cases, it is these forces of the autonomous Lord, which act as the motivators. b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality It is, therefore, under stimulation of the forces of the Lord, the knower of the consequences of actions, that wine maddens the drunkard resulting in the experience of pain, pleasure and stupor by him.
nirmale puṃsi neśasya prerakatvaṃ tathocitam | tulye nirmalabhāve ca prerayeyurna te katham | | tamīśaṃ prati yuktaṃ yad bhūyasāṃ syātsadharmatā | tena svarūpasvātantryamātraṃ malavijumbhitam | |	b-a Blemishless being the liberated individuals as well as the Lord Himself, since the individuals are in a large number as against the oneness of the Lord, why is it not possible that in the state of equality of blemishlessness on both the sides, stimulation for the covering might be coming from the individuals as it is said in the case of comparative strength of two sides in regard to righteousness also, the number of the upholders of the viewpoint needs to be entertained.
nirṇītaṃ vittataṃ caitanmayānyatretyalaṃ punaḥ | malo'bhilāṣaścājñānamavidyā lolikāprathā | | bhavadoṣo'nuplavaśca glāniḥ śoṣo vimūḍhatā| ahaṃmamātmatātaṅko māyāśaktirathāvṛtiḥ | doṣabījaṃ paśutvaṃ ca saṃsārāṅakurakāraṇam | ityādyanvarthasaṃjñābhistatra tatraiṣa bhaṇyate | |	b-a Malady, indeed, is a phenomenon out of simply the autonomy the individual has been accorded to get incorporated in his ideation as well as action as per the nature of the Lord Himself. Since I have deliberated on this point in detail elsewhere, it is better to stop here in this regard. b-a Malady has been pointed to almost synonymously in Sāstras differently by different authorities in different contexts as desire, ignorance, misunderstanding, instability, worldly blemish, deviation, gloom, dryness, idiocy, egotism, force of illusion, seed of blemish, animality, sprout of worldliness, etc.
asmin sati bhavati bhavo duṣṭo bhedātmaneti bhavadoṣaḥ | mañcavadasmin duḥkhasroto'ṇūn vahati yatplavastena |	b- In the presence of any such blemish, the world turns to become a curse due to arousal of the instinct of difference, and the stream of suffering carries away the individuals in its flow as it happens on the stage of drama.
śeṣāstu sugamarūpāḥ śabdāstatrārthamūhayeducitam | saṃsārakāraṇaṃ karma saṃsāraṅkura ucyate |	The rest of the account is quite easy to understand and one should understand it as per the context. -a Action serves as the ground for birth in the world and hence is perceived as the sprout of worldliness.
caturdaśavidhaṃ bhūtavaicitryaṃ karmajaṃ yataḥ | ata eva sāṃkhyayogapāñcarātrādiśāsane | |	This is why action is regarded as the root-cause of all the fourteen kinds of peculiarity in creatures. b-a This is why in the systems of Sankhya, Yoga, Pāñcarātra, etc.
ahaṃmameti saṃtyāgo naiṣkarmyāyopadiśyate | niṣkarmā hi sthite mūlamale'pyajñānanāmani |	getting rid of the attitudes of ‘I and Mine' has been stressed upon for the sake of becoming free of the malice of action. b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality In spite of having become rid of the malice of action, the individual concerned as yet has his status continued within the ambit of the fundamental malady known as ignorance.
vaicitryakāraṇābhāvānnordhvaṃ sarati nāpyadha | kevalaṃ pārimityena śivābhedamasaṃspṛśan | vijñānakevalī proktaḥ śuddhacinmātrasaṃsthitaḥ | sa punaḥ śāṃbhavecchātaḥ śivābhedaṃ parāmṛśan |	Lacking in the real knowledge as the requisite quality of transformation, he moves neither upward nor downward. Due to lacking in the wisdom of oneness with Siva, he remains limited to the state of vijñānakevali by virtue of his status in pure consciousness. b-a However, depending on the wish of Siva to that end, by virtue of his contemplation of oneness with Śiva, he gradually gets uplifted to the status of mantreśa and then to that of the state of mantra-mahesvara culminating in oneness with Siva.
kramānnmantreśatannetṛrūpo yāti śivātmatām | nanu kāraṇametasya karmaṇaścenmalaḥ katham | sa vijñānākalasyāpi na sūte karmasaṃtatim | maivaṃ sa hi malo jñānākale didhvaṃsiṣuḥ katham | hetuḥ syāddhvaṃsamānatvaṃ svātantryādeva codbhavet| didhvaṃsiṣudhvaṃsamānadhvastākhyāsu tisṛṣvatha |	b-a The question arises that in view of the prospect of the vijñāna-kevali getting oneness with Śiva owing to his treading the path of action, why is it that action is considered as malice instead of being regarded as the maker of a novel path of action? b-a This is not true. How can that malady prove destructive of the ignorance ? The cause of destruction amounting to elimination of ignorance ought to come from the independence of the individual. b-a In fact, it is out the quality of independence of the individual that have emerged the states of desire for elimination, process of elimination and the state of getting eliminated the malady of action resulting in the states of his destiny upward as vijñānākala, mantreśa and mantra-maheśvara, etc.
daśāsvantaḥ kṛtāvasthāntarāsu svakramasthiteḥ | vijñānākalamantreśatadīśāditvakalpanā |	b- In view of the above kind of concordance between the states of elimination of action on the one side and those of upgradation in the status of the individual on the other, several sub-states would be demarcated in the states of deep sleep and the fourth state of consciousness.
tataśca supte turye ca vakṣyate bahubhedatā | ataḥ pradhvasanaunmukhyakhilībhūtasvaśaktikaḥ |	Therefore, the cause of upgradation in the status of the individual should be regarded his inner strength in the elimination of the effect of action beginning from his desire to that end rather than to condemn action itself as a malady.
karmaṇo hetutāmetu malaḥ kathamivocyatām| kiṃ ca karmāpi na malādyataḥ karma kriyātmakam | kriyā ca kartṛtārūpāt svātantryānna punarmalāt | yā tvasya karmaṇaścitraphaladatvena karmatā |	-a Action does not fall in the category of maladies. It simply lies in activity while activity has its source in the independence of the doer and by no means in malady. b-a Activeness of action which lies in yielding peculiar results is impossible without contraction in the self and hence it is this contraction which is the malady. b- a Peculiarity of the fruit of action is dependent on the owning of it by the enjoyer.
bhoktaryātmani teneyaṃ bhedarūpā vyavasthitiḥ | iti svakāryaprasave sahakāritvamāśrayan | sāmarthyavyañjakatvena karmaṇa kāraṇaṃ malaḥ | nanvevaṃ karmasadbhāvānmalasyāpi sthiteḥ katham | |	b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Malady serves as the cause of action on account of rendering assistance to the self as a factor of the force of accomplishment of the action. b-a Now this being the status of action, how does malady's status fit in this state of things ? In response to this query, it needs to be understood that its status depends on the nature of vijñāna to contract like this.
nāhaṃ karteti manvānaḥ karmasaṃskāramujjhati| phaliṣyatīdaṃ karmeti yā dṛḍhā vṛttirātmani | sa saṃskāraḥ phalāyeha na tu smaraṇakāraṇam| apradhvaste'pi saṃkoce nāhaṃ karteti bhāvanāt |	b-a In spite of his consciousness remaining still contracted, in his contemplation he remains firm in his view that he is not the doer and by virtue of this kind of contemplation he is able to get relieved of the formation of the effect of his action. b-a "This action would but bear its fruit", this kind of firm conviction in the self is responsible for the formation of the impression, samskāra, concerned which bears the fruit of it and not the bare memory of the action.
na phalaṃ kṣīvamūḍhāde prāyaścitte'tha vā kṛte | yanmayādya tapastaptaṃ tadasmai syāditi sphuṭam | abhisaṃdhimataḥ karma na phaledabhisandhitaḥ | tathābhisaṃdhānākhyāṃ tu mānase karma saṃskriyām |	b-a ‘I am not the doer', this kind of ideation does not prove fruitful in removing the impression of action particularly from the idiotic and foolish as the contraction of his consciousness has not been eliminated irrespective of his having done atonement. b-a Śrī Tantrāloka “The result of the austerity that I have observed today may go to the particular person', this kind of determination would not bring its fruit to the person himself due to his determination of the dedication.
phaloparaktāṃ vidadhatkalpate phalasampade | yastu tatrāti dārthena phalasaṃskāramujjhati | | sa tanphalatyāgakṛtaṃ viśiṣṭaṃ phalamaśnute | anayā paripāṭyā yaḥ samastāṃ karma saṃtatim |	b-a Such a determination of dedication gets attached with the result of the action and consequently ends in the transference of it to the person in favour of whom the action has been accomplished. b-a If the doer of the action accomplishes the task with a strong point of view of abandonment of the fruit, he comes to enjoy a special result of it produced out of his determination of abandonment.
parasmai syānna vijñātaṃ bhavatā tāttvikaṃ vacaḥ | tasya bhoktustathā cetsyādabhisaṃdhiryātmani |	b-a In this way, he who accomplishes the entire series of his actions without attaching his I-ness with it, he deserves to be regarded as transcendent to all calculations despite the contraction of his consciousness.
tadavaśyaṃ parasyāpi satastaduṣkṛtaṃ bhavet | parābhisaṃdhisaṃvittau svābhisaṃdhirdṛḍhībhavet |	b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality If the enjoyer of the consequence were to apply the same formula to himself, the effect of the bad action of anyone else may fall on him, too, and thus the intention of the other one is likely to get confirmed.
abhisaṃdhānavirahe tvasya no phalayogitā | na me duṣkṛtamityeṣā rūḍhistasyāphalāya sā | |	Shorn of the sense of intention, the act is sure not to bear any fruit. His conviction that he is not the agent of the action of ill-will is sure to end in fruitlessness.
parābhisandhivicchede svātmanāmabhisaṃhitau | dvayorapi phalaṃ na syānnāśahetuvyavasthiteḥ |	b- If the other one breaks the agreement, the first one also would have to take it as broken from his side resulting in break from both the sides and hence ending in fruitlessness due to the presence of the cause of it.
sukhahetau sukhe cāsya sāmānyādabhisaṃdhitaḥ | nirviśeṣādapi nyāyyā dharmādiphalabhoktṛtā |	Usually there happens agreement between the experience of pleasure and its cause. Normally, it is justifiable to think of enjoyment as well as sufferance of the consequences of one's action righteous or evil.
duḥkhaṃ me duḥkhaheturvā syādityeṣa punarna tu | sāmānyo'pyabhisaṃdhiḥ syāttadadharmasya nāgamaḥ | |	This is true of the cause of the suffering as well. Thus, there is not any possibility for unrighteousness to be a welcome proposition as also for the sufferance of its consequences. - Let us deliberate on the topic at hand.
prakṛtaṃ brūmahe jñānākalasyoktacarasya yat | anahaṃyutayā sarvā vilīnāḥ karmasaṃskriyāḥ |	Since the person known as jñānākala one dipped in wisdom has become rid of the ego-sense, all the impressions of his action have also got wiped out.
tasmādasya na karmāsti kasyāpi sahakāritām | malaḥ karotu tenāyaṃ dhvaṃsamānatvamaśnute |	Since the action of the jñānākala has no blemish to cooperate with it, his ego- sense has reached the state of its annihilation.
apadhvastamalastvantaḥ śivāveśavaśīkṛtaḥ | ahaṃbhāvaparo'pyeti na karmādhīnavṛttitām |	Owing to interiorisation of the aspiration for Siva in him, his inner being becomes completely free of blemish and having freed himself from the control of the law of action he transcends the ego-sense.
uktaṃ śrīpūrvaśāstre ca tadetatparameśinā | malamajñānamicchanti saṃsārāṅkurakāraṇam |	It has also been stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra by Lord Siva Himself that wise people characterise ignorance as a malady and hence as the sprout of the evil of worldliness.
dharmādharmātmakaṃ karma sukhaduḥkhādilakṣaṇam | lakṣayetsukhaduḥkhādi svaṃ kāryaṃ hetubhāvataḥ | |	On account of being devilish as well as righteous, action, serves as the cause of suffering as well as joy. Thus, one needs to consider his rejoicing and suffering as the result of his own actions.
nahi hetuḥ kadāpyāste vinā kāryaṃ nijaṃ kvacit | hetutā yogyataivāsau phalānantaryabhāvitā |	-a Cause cannot be but its effect. Its causality lies in its capability of fruition in the form of effect.
pūrvakasya tu hetutvaṃ pāramparyeṇa kiṃ ca tat | lakṣyate sukhaduḥkhādyaiḥ samāne dṛṣṭakāraṇe | |	a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Experiences of joy and suffering both indicate to the nature of the action the experiencer would have performed.
citrairhetvantaraṃ kiṃcittacca karmeha darśanāt | svāṅge prasādaraukṣyādi jāyamānaṃ svakarmaṇā |	Due to peculiarity between the action and its result, the concept of adrsta, an unseen agent, has been mooted out by a certain school of thought. b-a Seeing smoothness and roughness, etc.
dṛṣṭamityanyadehasthaṃ kāraṇaṃ karma kalpyate | ihāpyanyānyadehasthe sphuṭaṃ karmaphale yataḥ |	b-a In the event of oneness of the investigator collecting evidence from different places, it is quite possible for him to search out the interconnection between the action and the result in spite of all the peculiarity of connecting the two as also the intervention of the factor of time.
tasyaiva tatphalaṃ citraṃ karma yasya purātanam| kṣīvo'pi rājā sūdaṃ cedādiśetprātarīdṛśam | bhojayetyanusandhānādvinā prāpnoti tatphalam | itthaṃ janmāntaropāttakarmāpyadyānusandhinā |	b-a Whatever a king, even though in a state of intoxication, orders his cook in the morning to prepare his food, he eats the same without any further query. Even so, under the imperative of the law of causation the doer of the action in his previous birth enjoys the result in this life which is owing to his prior determination in favour of the enjoyment.
ata eva kṛtaṃ karma karmaṇā tapasāpi vā |	b-a Therefore, it is necessary to stop the process of fruition of his acts on the verge of manifestation by means of action, austerity and wisdom.
jñānena vā nirudhyeta phalapākeṣvanunmukham | ārabdhakāryaṃ dehe'smin yatpunaḥ karma tatkatham | ucchidyatāmantyadaśaṃ nirodhuṃ nahi śakyate | tatraiva dehe yattvanyadadyagaṃ vā purātanam |	b-a Now the problem is how to stop the doing of the action which has been started in this life and obstruct the suffering of the consequences of the action of the previous life on the verge of manifestation? b-a In this context, it needs to be pointed out that an impression be it formed of old or even now can be neutralised in its potentiality of bearing fruit through initiation into the discipline of Saivism.
karma tajjñānadīkṣādyaiḥ śaṇḍhīkartuṃ prasahyate | tathā saṃskāradāḍhryaṃ hi phalāya dṛḍhatā punaḥ | yadā yadā vinaśyeta karma dhvastaṃ tadā tadā | ato mohaparādhīno yadyapyakṛta kiṃcana | |	b-a Firmness of impression results in firmness of the result. As such, whenever there be any possibility of elimination of the impression, one needs to make effort for its effacement. b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality The impression of that act also would be burnt out entirely at the time of initiation into the wisdom which might have been done in the state of temerity and hence be amounting to not to have been done at all.
tathāpi jñānakāle tatsarvameva pradahyate | uktaṃ ca śrīpare'hānādānaḥ sarvadṛgulvaṇaḥ | muhūrtānnirdahetsarvaṃ dehasthamakṛtaṃ kṛtam | dehasthamiti dehena saha tādātmyamāśritā | svācchandyātsaṃvidevoktā tatrasthaṃ karma dahyate | dehaikyavāsanātyāgāt sa ca viśvātmatāsthiteḥ |	b-a It has also been observed in the Para śāstra that as soon as the inner being becomes charged with the all-seeing consciousness which is eliminative of all the desires of acceptance and rejection, all the impressions of actions done or even not done lying in the body get burnt out. b-b The term dehastha, lying in the body, used in the previous verse amounts freely to the consciousness and, as such, the impression of the action imprinted on it get removed due to its universalisation and consequently owing to elimination of the mistaken identification of consciousness with the body.
akālakalite vyāpinyabhinne yā hi saṃskriyā | saṃkoca eva sānena so'pi dehaikatāmayaḥ |	b- Impression on the consciousness which lies in transcendence of time and space both is nothing but some sort of contraction of it caused particularly due to the mistake of identifying it with the body.
etatkārmamalaṃ proktaṃ yena sākaṃ layākalāḥ | syurguhāgahanāntasthāḥ suptā iva sarīsṛpāḥ |	This mistake of consciousness for a bodily property has been characterised as the malady of action, kārma-mala, due to which individuals get reduced to the status of creeping insects lying asleep inside deep caves.
tataḥ prabuddhasaṃskārāste yathocitabhāginaḥ | brahmādisthāvarānte'smin saṃsaranti punaḥ punaḥ |	Śrī Tantrāloka Those who have got awakened from such an impression, they get the result in the form of their movement in the world of Brahmā to the inanimate creation again and again.
ye punaḥ karmasaṃskārahānyai prārabdhabhāvanāḥ| bhāvanāpariniṣpattimaprāpya pralayaṃ gatāḥ | mahāntaṃ te tathāntaḥstha bhāvanāpākasauṣṭhavāt | mantratvaṃ pratipadyante citrāccitraṃ ca karmataḥ | |	Those who have started contemplation for getting rid of the impression of action and meet death without reaching the end of their contemplated aspiration, they by virtue of the firmness of their aspiration, attain the status of mantra, idea or force of wisdom which is specially born of the speciality of the effort for it.
asya kārmamalasyeyanmāyāntādhvavisāriṇaḥ | pradhānaṃ kāraṇaṃ proktamajñānātmāṇavo malaḥ |	- Malady of the individualistic ignorance is the main cause of the blemish of action extending in its effect throughout from the very beginning of the creation and climaxing in the removal of the māyā, illusion.
kṣobho'sya lolikākhyasya sahakāritayā sphuṭam | tiṣṭhāsāyogyataunmukhyamīśvarecchāvaśācca tat |	Agitation in the force of instability comes from the malady of action while capability of inclination for withstanding its primary cause and wish of the Lord as the subsidiary.
na jaḍaścidadhiṣṭhānaṃ vinā kvāpi kṣamo yataḥ | aṇavo nāma naivānyatprakāśātmā maheśvaraḥ |	Individuals are none but the great Lord Himself as the light of consciousness while the individual mistaking the body as consciousness and hence getting bound is an admixture of the animate and the inanimate, .
cidacidrūpatābhāsī pudgalaḥ kṣetravitpaśuḥ | cidrūpatvācca sa vyāpī nirguṇo niṣkriyastataḥ |	-a The individual as pure consciousness is pervasive, shorn of gunas and hence rid of action. He is also said to be eternal and formless.
bhogopāyepsuko nityo mūrtivandhyaḥ prabhāṣyate | acittvādajñatā bhedo bhogyādbhoktrantarādatha |	Due to his eagerness for enjoyment he gets intermixed with the inanimate. This is how he becomes ignorant, differentiator between the enjoyer and the object of enjoyment.
īśvarecchāvaśādasya bhogecchā saṃprajāyate | bhogecchorupakārārthamādyo mantramaheśvaraḥ | māyāṃ vikṣobhya saṃsāraṃ nirmimīte vicitrakam | māyā ca nāma devasya śaktiravyatirekiṇī |	b- The malady of action the individual gets abundantly awakened under the imperative of the Lord. This has been stated in Mālinivijayottara Tantra. Due to the wish of the Lord arises in him the desire for enjoyment. The primeval Mantra-maheśvara creates the world with all its diversity by causing agitation in the Māyā to favour him through the provision of the means of enjoyment.
bhedāvabhāsasvātantryaṃ tathāhi sa tayā kṛtaḥ | ādyo bhedāvabhāvo yo vibhāgamanupeyivān |	She is simply His autonomy of presenting the semblance of difference through her. b-a The primeval form of the semblance of difference is not effectively divisive.
garbhīkṛtānantabhāvivibhāsā sā parā niśā | sā jaḍā bhedarūpatvāt kāryaṃ cāsyā jaḍaṃ yataḥ |	She, however, has got in her womb in the potential state the entire variety of division. As such, she is characterised as the Transcendent Night, parā-niśā. b-a Nature is inanimate. It is divisive.
vyāpinī viśvahetutvāt sūkṣmā kāryekakalpanāt | śivaśaktyavinābhāvānnityaikā mūlakāraṇam | |	It is pervasive, as it serves as the cause of the universe. It is subtle and, therefore, is imagined only through its products. It is dependent on Śiva and Sakti.
acetanamanekātmasarvaṃ kāryaṃ yathā ghaṭaḥ | pradhānaṃ ca tathā tasmāt kāryaṃ nātmā tu cetanaḥ |	b- It is inconscient and cause of the entire diversity, as of the jar, for instance. It is the primary potentiality of all actions. ātman, as the concentricity of consciousness, is not so.
ata evādhvani proktā pūrvaṃ mayā dvidhā sthitā | yathā ca māyā devasya śaktirabhyeti bhedinam |	Therefore, in course of my deliberation on the path leading to Siva, I have described it as existing in a dual form. -a As māyā as the force of the Lord comes to cause division in things even so His other forces, such as kalā, etc.
ttvabhāvaṃ tathānyo'pi kalādistattvavistaraḥ | nirūddhaśakteryā kiṃcitkartṛtodvalanātmikā | nāthasya śaktiḥ sādhastātpuṃsaḥ kṣetro kalocyate | evaṃ vidyādayo'pyete dharāntāḥ paramārthataḥ |	b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Whatever creativity the individual displays with the application of his obstructed force, is of the nature of projection and is the same as that of the Lord imbued with all its autonomy and here in the world coming to the individual it is known as kalā and becomes projective. b-a Even so are the elements starting from vidyā and ending with earth.
śivaśaktimayā eva proktanyāyānusārataḥ | tathāpi yatpṛthagbhānaṃ kalāderīśvarecchayā |	They are Siva and Sakti themselves as per the logic talked of. Even then, they appear as different from them and that also due to the wish of the Lord.
tato jaḍatve kāryatve pṛthaktattvasthitau dhruvam | upādānaṃ smṛtā māyā kvacitatkāryameva ca | |	b- Therefore, behind their having become inanimate, products of action and standing apart from Śiva, obviously the cause is the māyā sometimes turning into the result as well.
tathāvabhāsacitraṃ ca rūpamanyonyavarjitam | yadbhāti kila saṃkalpe tadasti ghaṭavadvahiḥ |	This kind of appearance of them as apart from Siva is somewhat like the pitcher appearing as entirely separate from the clay.
khapuṣpādyastitāṃ būmastato na vyabhicāritā | khapuṣpaṃ kāladiṅmātṛsāpekṣaṃ nāstiśabdataḥ | |	Assertion of the existence of ākāśa-puspa, sky flower, is not absolutely baseless, since existence of that flower is relative to time, space and the knower of it, as is the case with the earth, etc.
dharādivat tathātyantābhāvo'pyevaṃ vivicyatām | yatsaṃkalpyaṃ tathā tasya bahirdeho'sti cetanaḥ | |	As a conscious being thinks of, so does its bodily representation exist outside. Wondrous is the verity of existence from earth to Siva. Whose body is of what kind so does exists the world, outside.
caitravatsauśivāntaṃ tat sarvaṃ tādṛśadehavat | yasya deho yathā tasya tajjātīyaṃ puraṃ bahiḥ | ataḥ suśivaparyantā siddhā bhuvanapaddhatiḥ | ātmanāṃ tatpuraṃ prāpyaṃ deśatvādanyadeśavat |	This is how is proved the gradation of the creation up to Śiva. -a As is the case with a person migrating from one country to another and surviving there, so is the case with the Self departing from one state of being to another and remaining there no matter suffering or enjoying.
ātmanāmadhvabhoktṛtvaṃ tato'yatnena siddhyati | sā māyā kṣobhamāpannā viśvaṃ sūte samantataḥ | daṇḍāhatevāmalakī phalāni kila yadyapi | tathāpi tu tathā citrapaurvāparyāvabhāsanāt | |	b-a Having reached the state of agitation that māyā gives birth to the world all around in the same way as the tree of emblic myobalan Indian gooseberry, āmalaki, yields fruits having been hit by a stick. In spite of all the contingency involved in the work of māyā in this respect, in view of appearance of peculiar sequence in the results, the law of causality has been observed in operation.
māyākārye'pi tattvaudhe kāryakāraṇatā mithaḥ | sā yadyapyanyaśāstreṣu bahudhā dṛśyate sphuṭam | tathāpi mālinīśāstradṛśā tāṃ saṃpracakṣmahe | kalādivasudhāntaṃ yanmāyāntaḥ saṃpracakṣate |	b-a Though that law has been viewed in its explicit operation in several other Sāstras, we are presenting here the viewpoint as recounted in the Mālini Tantra. b- a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality The entire range of the operation of māyā extending from the kalā up to the earth varies from individual to individual as is obvious from the variation in the degrees of pleasure and pain, etc.
pratyātmabhinnamevaitat sukhaduḥkhādibhedataḥ | ekasyāmeva jagati bhogasādhanasaṃhatau | sukhādīnāṃ samaṃ vyakterbhogabhedaḥ kuto bhavet | na cāsau karmabhedena tasyaivānupapattitaḥ | |	b-a In one and the same world with all its commonness of the means of enjoyment, why is it that the quantum of enjoyment as well as that of suffering differs from individual to individual? b-a It is untenable to propose that this variation is due to variation in the quantum of action from person to person.
tasmāt kalādiko vargo bhinna eva kadācana | aikyametīśvarecchāto nuttagītādivādane |	The variation is probably due to variation in the individual's sharing in the basic elements from kalā to the earth.
eṣāṃ kalāditattvānāṃ sarveṣāmapi bhāvinām | śuddhatvamasti teṣāṃ ye śaktipātapavitritāḥ |	b- In regard to these elements like kalā, etc. it needs to be understood that, though available to all in common, they bring purity to only those who are blessed with the transmission of the force of consciousness, sakti-pāta.
kalā hi śuddhā tattādṛk karmatvaṃ saprasūyate | mitamapyāśu yenāsmāt saṃsārādeṣa mucyate |	Being purified, kalā generates such an inclination to action owing to even a little of which the individual gets liberated from the world forthwith.
rāgavidyākālayatiprakṛtyakṣārthasaṃcayaḥ | itthaṃ śuddha iti prācya gururmānastutau vibhuḥ |	Attachment, wisdom, time, destiny, senses and their objects, all these are pure in themselves. This has been stated by my revered teacher Vidyādhipati in his book titled Pramāṇastotra.
evameṣā kalādīnāmutpattiḥ pravivicyate | māyātattvāt kalā jātā kiṃcitkartṛtvalakṣaṇā |	Thus is being discussed the origin of elements kalā, etc. Kalā is born of māyā and is characterised by a bit of action which it accords to the individual.
māyā hi cinmayādbhedaṃ śivādvidadhatī paśoḥ | suṣuptatāmivādhatte tata eva hyadṛkriyaḥ | |	Māyā is the force responsible for creating the difference of the individual from Śiva by making him go to some sort of sound sleep due to which he becomes virtually unsighted and inactive.
kalā hi kiṃcitkartṛtvaṃ svāliṅganādaṇoḥ tasyāścāpyaṇunānyonyaṃ hyañjane sā prasūyate |	Kalā accords a little of activity to the individual through her embrace with him. It is born of the embrace of the individual with the kalā.
sadyonirvāṇadīkṣotthapuṃviśleṣe hi sā satī śliṣyantyapi ca no sūte tathāpi svaphalaṃ kvacit |	Meanwhile if the individual becomes initiated into the path of immediate liberation, the effect of the embrace becomes nullified and therefore in spite of her remaining embracing him, she does not give birth to anything.
ucchūnateva prathamā sūkṣmākurakaleva ca | bījasyāmbvagnimṛtkambutuṣayogāt prasūtikṛt |	Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality It is a little swelling in the seed which takes the form of the sprout of kalā particularly with the contact of water, heat, clay and manure.
kalā māyāṇusaṃyogajāpyeṣā nirvikārakam | nāṇuṃ kuryādupādānaṃ kiṃtu māyāṃ vikāriṇīm | |	In spite of being a child of māyā, kalā is by no means the vitiator of the individual directly but through the māyā herself which is essentially of that nature.
malaścāvārako māyā bhāvopādānakāraṇam | syāt sahakāyeṃ karma sukhaduḥkhodbhavaṃ prati | |	Malice simply covers while māyā serves as the material cause of creation. Action plays the role of the assistant in causing the states of pleasure and pain.
ataḥ sacchannacaitanyasamudvalanakāryakṛt | kalaivānantanāthasya śaktyā saṃpreritā jaḍā | | na ceśaśattirevāsya caitanyaṃ valayiṣyati | tadupovalitaṃ taddhi na kiṃcitkatṛtāṃ vrajet | |	Though inanimate, being empowered by the power of animation of the Lord, kalā herself serves as the agent of atomisation of consciousness of the individual in its role of restriction. Why is it that the power of the Lord Himself does not act directly as the agency of restricting the expanse of consciousness in the act of its atomisation? To this objection the answer is that having been atomised by the force of the Lord Himself, the individual was not likely to have been restricted in his power of action.
seyaṃ kalā na karaṇaṃ mukhyaṃ vidyādikaṃ yathā | puṃsi kartari sā kartrī prayojakatayā yataḥ | |	Kalā is not the main instrument of delimitation as are vidyā, etc. She acts simply as a factor of stimulation in the doer.
alakṣyāntarayoritthaṃ yadā puṃskalayorbhavet | māyāgarbheśaktyāderantarajñānamāntaram | tadā māyāpuṃvivekaḥ sarvakarmakṣayādbhavet | vijñānākalatā māyādhastānno yātyadhaḥ pumān | |	On removal of the ignorance of the difference between the Purusa and the kalā, when the individual becomes aware of the secret of the presence of the force of the Lord in the māyā by virtue of elimination of all the impressions of action resulting in discrimination between the māyā and the Purusa, he attains the state of getting inside the range of wisdom, vijñānākalatā and no more has the liability of going down to māyā.
dhīpuṃviveke vijñāte pradhānapuruṣāntare | api na kṣīṇakarmā syāt kalāyāṃ taddhi saṃbhavet | |	- It is not necessary that one may get rid of the impressions of action by developing discrimination between the Purusa and the intellect Mahat but this is quite possible through understanding of the role of the kalā.
ataḥ sāṃkhyadṛśā siddhaḥ pradhānādho na saṃsaret | kalāpuṃsorviveke tu māyādho naiva gacchati |	Thus it is obvious by following the line of the Sānkhya as also that after the discrimination between the Purusa and the Prakrti one becomes spared of the danger of going down to the latter but after the discrimination between the kalā and the Purusa, however, it is sure that he would not be bound to go down to māyā.
māyāgarbhādhikāriṇo dvayorantye tu nirmalaḥ | seyaṃ kalā kāryabhedādanyaiva hyanumīyate | |	Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality On elimination of the māyā along with its presiding agencies, the aspirant becomes completely rid of malice. This is due to her being different from māyā in this respect.
anyathaika bhavedviśvaṃ kāryāyetyanyanihnavaḥ | iti mataṅgaśāstrādau yā proktā sā kalā svayam |	There is no doubt about it. -a In the texts like Matanga Sāstra, etc., kalā has been introduced as different from māyā as an instrument of accordance of a little of creativity to the individual.
kiṃcidrūpatayākṣipya kartṛtvamiti bhaṅgitaḥ | kiṃcidrūpaviśiṣṭaṃ yat kartṛtvaṃ tatkathaṃ bhavet |	b-a How can that agent be creative which has been accorded only a partial form? It is in order to answer to this objection that the individual has been imbued with partial knowledgeability.
ajñasyeti tataḥ sūte kiṃcijjñatvātmikāṃ vidam | buddhiṃ paśyati sā vidyā buddhidarpaṇacāriṇaḥ | |	b-a Wisdom has a look of discretion on the intellect in its movement over the mirror of ideation.
sukhādīn pratyayān mohaprabhṛtīn kāryakāraṇe | karmajālaṃ ca tatrasthaṃ vivinakti nijātmanā |	Through that look by means of the Self it exercises discrimination between cause and effect in regard to experiences of pleasure and pain, delusion, etc. and indeed in regard to the entire range of action and its results.
buddhistu guṇasaṃkīrṇā vivekena kathaṃ sukham | duḥkhaṃ mohātmakaṃ vāpi viṣayaṃ darśayedapi | svacchāyāṃ dhiyi saṃkrāmanbhāva saṃvedyatāṃ katham | tayā vinaiti sāpyanyatkaraṇaṃ puṃsi kartari |	b- Due to the limitation of the gunas on it, how can intellect be discrete in regard to the experiences of pleasure, pain and elusion? How can an image reflected in the mirror of the intellect, howsoever clean, can be sensitive as the intellect itself is inanimate without the help of the wisdom which, too, depends on the Purusa for animation ? In response to this objection, it may be contended that since the mirror of intellect is absolutely clean, it is sure to reflect the light of consciousness exactly as it falls on it.
nanu cobhayataḥ śubhrādarśadaśīyadhīgatāt | puṃsprakāśādbhāti bhāvaḥ maivaṃ tatpratibimbanam |	This kind of reflection does not solve the problem since due to its inanimateness; the intellect would reflect the light of consciousness only as something like the external light and by no means as the light of consciousness which is absolutely a matter of inner being .
jaḍameva hi mukhyo'tha puṃsprakāśo'sya bhāsanam| bahiḥ sthasyaiva tasyāstu buddheḥ kiṃ kalpanā kṛtā |	In view of this difficulty involved in it, what is the use of the conception of the intellect as such ? - There is no place for any difference within the inner being and yet it becomes imputed with the idea of difference.
abhedabhūmireṣā ca bhedaśceha vicāryate | tasmādbuddhigato bhāvo vidyākaraṇagocaraḥ | bhāvānāṃ pratibimbaṃ ca vedyaṃ dhīkalpanā tataḥ | kiṃcittu kurute tasmānnūnamastyaparaṃ tu tat |	This why whatever of the self is reflected in the intellect becomes visible outside via the consciousness and the senses as the world. Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality The individual acts only a little as also knows only a little leaving the rest undone and unknown. As such, there must be a certain factor other than kalā and vidyā which determines what to do and what to know as well as what to leave out undone and unknown.
rāgatattvamiti proktaṃ yattatraivoparañjakam | na cāvairāgyamātraṃ tattatrāpyāsaktivṛttitaḥ | viraktāvapi tṛptasya sūkṣmarāgavyavasthiteḥ | kālastuṭyādibhiścaitat kartṛtvaṃ kalayatyataḥ |	This factor is known as rāga, attachment since it draws the attention of the individual towards the object of action and knowledge. - a This element of attachment is not sheer negation of detachment, since even in detachment there is an element of attachment, as is to be traced a subtle sense of attachment even in the state of detachment.
kāryāvacchedi vartṛtvaṃ kālo'vaśyaṃ kaliṣyati | niyatiryojanāṃ dhatte viśiṣṭe kāryamaṇḍale |	b-a The individual remains calculating his role as the doer in the framework of time. Therefore, it is obvious that doership is associated with action and that wherever there is the sense of time, it cannot be associated with the act of calculation.
vidyārāgo'tha niyatiḥ kālaścaitaccatuṣṭayam | kalākāryaṃ bhoktṛbhāve tiṣṭhadbhoktṛtvapūritam |	b Vidyā, rāga, niyati and kāla are the four products of kalā having their locus in the subject of enjoyment and suffering on account of themselves being filled with the sense of oneness with that locus.
māyā kalā rāgavidye kālo niyatireva ca | kañcukāni ṣaḍuktāni saṃvidastatsthitau paśuḥ |	Māyā, kalā, rāga, vidyā, kāla and niyati, these factors are said to serve as the coverings of consciousness in reducing the status of the individual from Siva- hood to that of the bound self paśu.
dehapuryaṣṭakādyeṣu vedyeṣu kila vedanam | etatṣaṭkasasaṃkocaṃ yadavedyamasāvaṇuḥ |	Anu, individual, is formed through contraction of consciousness to the extent ranging from abundant to the little culminating even in its total absence.
uktaṃ śivatanuśāstre tadidaṃ bhaṅagyantareṇa punaḥ | āvaraṇaṃ sarvātmagamaśuddhiranyāpyananyarūpaiva |	It has been observed in the Sivatanu śāstra in a different way that the coverings are common to all selves and its purity though essentially of a different nature, becomes one with them.
śivadahanakiraṇajālairdāhyatvāt sā yato'nyarūpaiva | anidaṃpūrvatayā yadrañjayati nijātmanā tato'nanyā |	Since, however, it colours the consciousness by getting mixed with the latter to the extent of non-difference from the same, it is regarded as identical with it. Due to the agency of māyā and the Lord both being operative on it, the coverings take a threefold form.
sahajāśuddhimato'ṇorīśaguhābhyāṃ hi kañcukastrividhaḥ| tasya dvitīyacitiriva svacchasya niyujyate kalā kṣlakṣṇā | anayā vidvasya paśorupabhogasamarthatā bhavati | vidyā cāsya kalātaḥ śaraṇāntardīpakaprabhevābhūt | |	One as owing to the operation of the Lord, second owing to the operation of māyā and the third owing to its own force of covering. -a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Due to association of the covering with kalā in all its smoothness as well as with the vidyā like a light from behind a cover, the animated individual develops the will to enjoy.
sukhaduḥkhasaṃvidaṃ yā vivinakti paśorvibhāgena | rāgaśca kalātattvācchucivastrakaṣāyavat samutpannaḥ |	b- Consciousness involved in the experience of pleasure and pain differs from the pure form of it as lying implicit in the individual. Hence rāga arises as the colouring of a piece of cloth.
tyaktaṃ vāñchati na yataḥ saṃsṛtisukhasaṃvidānandam | evamavidyāmalinaḥ samarthitastriguṇakañcukabalena |	Since the individual is not willing to forsake the joy of the worldly sense of pleasure and pain having been entrapped in the malice, the covering gets confirmed on him owing to the accession of the three gunas on his psyche.
gahanopabhogagarbhe paśuravaśamadhomukhaḥ patati | etena mala kathitaḥ kambukavadaṇoḥ kalādikaṃ tuṣavat |	falls below his face turned downward in the deep pit of experience of pleasure and pain. -a This is why malice as born of the operation of kalā, etc.
evaṃ kalākhyatattvasya kiṃcitkartṛtvalakṣaṇe | viśeṣabhāge kartṛtvaṃ carcitaṃ bhoktapūrvakam | |	b Thus gets explained the partial role of the element of kalā in involving the individual in the act of experiencing pain and pleasure as the subject.
viśeṣaṇatayā yo'tra kiñcidbhāgastadotthitam | vedyamātraṃ sphuṭaṃ bhinnaṃ pradhānaṃ sūyate kalā |	The partial role of kalā in the act of individualisation is obviously limited to only the object of experience as its adjective which gets externalised in the form of the pradhāna, Nature.
samameva hi bhogyaṃ ca bhoktāraṃ ca prasūyate | kalā bhedābhisaṃdhānādaviyuktaṃ parasparam | | bhoktṛbhogyātmatā na syādviyogācca parasparam | vilīnāyāṃ ca tasyāṃ syānmāyā api na kiṃcana | nanu śrīmadarauravādau rāgavidyātmakaṃ dvayam | sūte kalā hi yugapattato'vyaktamiti sthitiḥ |	As against this is it not feasible to contend that the kalā gives birth to both enjoyer and the object of enjoyment together simply as two aspects of one and the same reality to get separated subsequently as per their mutual agreement? If the enjoyer and the object of enjoyment were to be considered as to have got separated even subsequently from each other, there would not be any possibility of their assuming the respective roles and māyā, too, would have nothing to do, since the individual having freed from the responsibility of the agent of enjoyment and suffering both would have to be admitted as a liberated one. Now as per the texts like Raurava and the rest of the kind, kalā is said to have given birth to rāga and vidyā simultaneously and then to the avyakta, unmanifest.
uktamatra vibhātyeṣa kramaḥ satyaṃ tathā hyalam | rajyamāno veda sarvaṃ vidaṃścāpyatra rajyate |	Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality It is true that this sort of sequence is obvious from accounts like the above, even then, however, it is only the consciousness as the subject to get coloured which is required to pre-exist the act of colouring.
tathāpi vastusatteyamihāsmābhirnirūpitā| tasyāṃ ca na kramaḥ ko'pi syādvā so'pi viparyaṃyāt | |	In spite of all these probabilities, what we have elucidated here is the real state of things in regard to the Reality which does not admit of any sequence in it and if at all, that may be understood as the reversed form of it.
tasmādvipratipatiṃ no kuryācchāstrodite vidhau |	Therefore, one need not raise doubt in what the texts tell us.
evaṃ saṃvedyamātraṃ yat sukhaduḥkhavimohataḥ | bhotsyate yattataḥ proktaṃ tatsāmyātmakamāditaḥ |	-a Thus, it is obvious from sheer experience that whatever is going to turn into pleasure, pain and stagnation moha, ought to have been initially the state of balance amongst these kinds of variation.
sukhaṃ sattvaṃ prakāśatvāt prakāśo dṇā ucyate | duḥkhaṃ rajaḥ kriyātmatvāt kriyā hi tadavatkramaḥ| mohastamo varaṇakaḥ prakāśābhāvayogataḥ |	b-a Experience of pleasure ought to relate to the satoguna, as it is of luminous nature which is said to generate joy while experience of pain should relate to the rajoguna which is of the nature of action and is a state of mixture of light and darkness. Stagnation is the nature of tamoguna which is obstructive as it lacks in luminosity.
ta ete kṣobhamāpannā guṇāḥ kāryaṃ pratanvate | akṣubdhasya vijātīyaṃ na syāt kāryamadaḥ purā |	b- Śrī Tantrāloka These gunas display their effect having become agitated, since without getting agitated, anything being of different nature, ought not to start activity initially.
uktameveti śāstre'smin guṇāstattvāntaraṃ viduḥ|	This is why in the discipline of the thought concerned i..e, Sankhya the gunas are treated as representing the state of Prakrti other than the original.
bhuvanaṃ pṛthagevātra darśitaṃ guṇabhedataḥ |	- a In our system of thought states of creation bhuvana have been shown as different from the guṇas.
īśvarecchāvaśakṣubdhalolikaṃ puruṣaṃ prati | bhoktṛtvāya svatantreśaḥ prakṛrti kṣobhayed bhṛśam |	b The possibility is that the Lord, due to being of absolutely independent nature, would have agitated the Prakrti quite abundantly for the sake of the individual of instable nature.
tena yaccodyate sāṃkhyaṃ muktāṇuṃ prati kiṃ na sā | sūte puṃso vikāritvāditti tannātra bādhakam |	Herein lies the answer to the objection why is it that the Prakrti does not become operative on liberated individuals in the form of creation of imbalance in them.
guṇebhyo buddhitattvaṃ tat sarvato nirmaṃlaṃ tataḥ | puṃsprakāśaḥ sa vedyo'tra pratibimbatvamārchati |	In comparison to gunas, intellect is malice-less from all around. Therefore, the light of the purusa becomes reflected in it almost in its original purity.
vṛttirbodho bhavedbuddheḥ sā cāpyālambanaṃ dhruvam | ātmasaṃvitprakāśasya bodho'sau tajjaḍo'pyalam | | buddherahaṃkṛt tādṛkṣe pratibimbitapuṃskṛteḥ| prakāśe vedyakaluṣe yadahaṃmananātmatā |	Such a mode of consciousness getting reflected in the intellect, serves decidedly as its mainstay of awareness. This awareness of the light of consciousness, proves clear enough to generate the sense of the real, inanimate nature of the intellect notwithstanding. - In spite of receiving the reflection of the Purusa in the form of illumination of consciousness, the intellect becomes blurred owing to its contact with worldly objects.
tayā pañcavidhaścaiṣa vāyuḥ saṃrambharūpayā | prerito jīvanāya syādanyathā maraṇaṃ punaḥ |	The five kinds of prāna operating in the body accrue out of agitation in the ego- sense and keep the life sustained otherwise the individual ceases to live.
ata eva viśuddhātmasvātantryāhaṃsvabhāvataḥ | akṛtrimādidaṃ tvanyadityuktaṃ kṛtiśabdataḥ |	Ego-sense is the I-centric state of the autonomy of the pure ātman which is different from egotism on account its being a sheer reflection in contrast to the latter being something created as is obvious from the use of the root kr, to create in the formation of the word ahankāra.
ityayaṃ karaṇaskandho'haṃkārasya nirūpitaḥ | tridhāsya prakṛtiskandhaḥ sāttvarājasatāmasaḥ |	Until now we have reflected on the role of egotism as an instrument. Now, as regards its nature, it is of three kinds, namely, as dominated by the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas separately.
sattvapradhānāhaṃkārādbhoktraṃśāsparśinaḥ sphuṭam | manobuddhyakṣaṣaṭkaṃ tu jātaṃ bhedastu kathyate |	From the satoguna-dominated aspect of egotism is born the agent of enjoyment and suffering along with manas and the five senses which are as follows.
mano yatsarvaviṣayaṃ tenātra pravivakṣitam | sarvatanmātrakartṛtvaṃ viśeṣaṇamahaṃkṛteḥ | |	Role of manas is common to all the sensory objects. This has been admitted by all the schools of thought while the creatorship of all the tanmātras is accorded to the ego-sense.
buddhyahaṃkṛnmanaḥ prāhurbodhasaṃraṃbhaṇaiṣaṇe| karaṇaṃ bāhyadevairyannaivāpyantarmukhaiḥ kṛtam |	Awareness, assertion and wishing are the functions of the intellect, egotism and manas respectively. The necessity of admitting these three as aspects of the antaḥ-karaṇa, internal tools of the psyche.
prāṇaśca nāntakaraṇaṃ jaḍatvāt preraṇātmanaḥ | prayatnecchāvibodhāṃśahetutvāditi niścitam | avasāyo'bhimānaśca kalpanā ceti na kriyā| ekarūpā tatastritvaṃ yuktamantaḥ kṛtau sphuṭam |	apart from the senses arises out of the difficulty that the senses cannot play the dual role of sensing objects from outside and getting interiorised simultaneously to accomplish the tasks of awareness, assertion and wishing inside. Prāņa cannot be treated as an internal organ of the psyche since it is inanimate and needs someone else to stimulate it to put in effort, will and be aware of.
na ca buddhirasaṃvedyā karaṇatvānmano yathā | pradhānavadasaṃvedya buddhivādastadujjhitaḥ | |	The intellectualism of the Sānkhyas in regard to the insensibility of the intellect stands cancelled herewith since on account of being an aspect of the internal organ like the manas, it, too, cannot afford to be insensible as is the case with the Pradhāna, Nature.
śabdatanmātrahetutvaviśiṣṭā yā tvahaṃkṛtiḥ | sā śrotre karaṇaṃ yāvadbhrāṇe gandhatvabheditā | bhautikatvamato'pyastu niyamādviṣayeṣvalam | ahaṃśṛṇomi paśyāmi jighrāmītyādisaṃvidi | | ahaṃtānugamādāhaṃkārikatvaṃ sphuṭaṃ sthitam | karaṇatvamato yuktaṃ kartraśaspṛktvayogataḥ |	The ego-sense plays its role in the reception of the sensation of sound by virtue of being receptive of the tanmātrā of sound while that of the reception of the sense of smell by virtue of being receptive to the tanmātrā of touch The opposition contends that the senses should be regarded as physical also on account of the limitation of their receptivity to a particular kind of sensation each. As against this suggestion the author observes that as each act of perception bears the sense of I ness such as 'I hear', ‘I see', ‘I smell', etc. the association of the senses with the ahankāra becomes established.
karturvibhinnaṃ karaṇaṃ preryatvāt karaṇaṃ kutaḥ | karaṇāntaravāñchāyāṃ bhavettatrānavasthitiḥ |	-a An instrument's instrumentality lies in its proneness to the receptivity of the stimulator of the doer as a part of his personality. If the instrument were to be regarded as absolutely other than what is connected with him, how can it play the role of the instrument as the role concerned depends on the stimulation of the doer? On admittance of stimulator other than the doer, there would arise the flaw.
tasmāt svātantryayogena kartā svaṃ bhedayan vapuḥ | karmāṃśasparśinaṃ svāṃśaṃ karaṇīkurute svayam |	b- Therefore, the doer through the application of his autonomy creates bifurcation in his body and makes use of the active part of himself as the instrument of action.
karaṇīkṛtatatsvāṃśatanmayībhāvanāvaśāt | karaṇīkurute'tyantavyatiriktaṃ kuṭhāravat | |	He makes use of a part of himself such as the senses and the antaḥ-karaṇa as an instrument of action and knowledge considering them as other than himself as an axe.
tenāśuddhaiva vidyāsya sāmānyaṃ karaṇaṃ purā | jñaptau kṛtau tu sāmānyaṃ kalā karaṇamucyate |	Therefore, like the impure wisdom serving previously as the instrument of knowledge, the same role is played by kalā in regard to action.
nanu śrīmataṅgādau kalāyāḥ kartṛtoditā | tasyāṃ satyāṃ hi vidyāyāḥ karaṇatvārhatājuṣaḥ |	Now, in texts like Matanga Sāstra, kalā has been said to be the doer. In view of this state of things in regard to kalā, it is but justified to accept the instrumentality of vidyā, wisdom.
ucyate kartṛtaivoktā karaṇatve prayojikā | tayā vinā tu nānyeṣāṃ karaṇānāṃ sthitiryataḥ |	It is doership which Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality requires the instrument to accomplish the task concerned. In the absence of the doership, there is no necessity of any instrument whatsoever.
ato'sāmānyakaraṇavargāt tatra pṛthak kṛtā | vidyāṃ vinā hi nānyeṣāṃ karaṇānāṃ nijā sthitiḥ | kalāṃ vinā na tasyāśca kartṛtve jñātṛtā yataḥ | kalāvidye tataḥ puṃso mukhyaṃ tatkaraṇaṃ biduḥ |	This is why vidyā has been kept apart from the uncommon instrument. In the absence of vidyā, instruments other than it have no relevance for being. In the absence of kalā, there is no scope for the being of vidyā. As the roles of doer and knower are interrelated both kalā and vidyā are said to be the main instruments at the disposal of Purușa.
ata eva vihīne'pi buddhikarmendriyaiḥ kvacit| andhe pau rūpagatiprakāśo na na bhāsate |	- It is owing to this kind of relationship between vidyā and kalā that sometimes lacking even in organs of sense and action, as in the blind and the lame, scarcely does it happen that they do not see form or become motionless.
kiṃtu sāmānyakaraṇabalādvedye'pi tādṛśi | rūpasāmānya evāndhaḥ pratipattiṃ prapadyate |	However, in regard to understanding, the person deficient in the special organ for it, makes use of the capacity of the common one, as is exemplified by the blind seeing only the common form.
tata eva tvahaṃkārāt tanmātrasparśino'dhikam | karmendriyāṇi vākpāṇipāyūpasthāṅghri jajñire |	Thus, it is owing to its relatively closer contact with the tanmātrās that have been born from the ego-sense the organs of action, namely, vocal organ, hands, feet, organs of evacuation and procreation.
vacmyādade tyajāmyāśu visṛjāmi vrajāmi ca | iti yāhaṃkriyā kāryakṣamā karmendriyaṃ tu tat |	‘I speak’, ‘I receive', ‘I relinquish', ‘I release', ‘I go', in these statements ego- sense which is invariably involved is expressive of one's capacity for action and that is the organ of action.
tena cchinnakarasyāsti hastaḥ karmendriyātmakaḥ | tasya pradhānādhiṣṭhānaṃ paraṃ pañcāṅguliḥ karaḥ | |	It is owing to the source of action lying in the ego-sense that even the handless person gets served the task of hands though the main organ of action for this is the hand with all the five fingers remaining intact.
mukhenāpi yadādānaṃ tatra yat karaṇaṃ sthitam | sa pāṇireva karaṇaṃ vinā kiṃ saṃbhavet kriyā | |	When the task of receiving gets accomplished through the mouth, mouth itself needs to be considered as hand in this case, as any action is impossible without the use of the instrument.
tathābhāve tu buddhyakṣairapi kiṃ syātprayojanam | darśanaṃ karaṇāpekṣaṃ kriyātvāditi cocyate |	Lacking in the capacity to serve as the instrument, sense organs also would become devoid of purpose. The act of seeing is dependent on the organ of sight, for example, as it is an action.
parairgamau tu karaṇaṃ neṣyate ceti vismayaḥ | gamanotkṣepaṇādīni mukhyaṃ karmopalambhanam | |	Indeed, it is surprising that the followers of the school of logic Naiyāyikas do not accept the instrumentality of feet in the task of movement.
punarguṇaḥ kriyā tveṣā vaiyākaraṇadarśane | kriyā karaṇapūrveti vyāptyā karaṇapūrvakam | |	b-a Action presupposes the tool as is obvious universally.
jñānaṃ nādānamityetat sphuṭamānrdhavajṛmbhitam | tasmāt karmendriyāṇyāhustvagvadvyāptaṛṇi mukhyataḥ |	To contend that knowing does not involve any action is obviously a display of blindness to the actual state of things as is done by the Naiyāyikas, followers of the school of philosophy of logic.
tatsthāne vṛttimantīti mataṅge guravo mama | nanvanyānyapi karmāṇi santi bhūyāṃsi satkṛte | karaṇānyapi vācyāni tathā cākṣeṣvaniṣṭhitiḥ | nanvetat kheṭapālādyairnirākāri na karmaṇām |	b-a Therefore, my teachers in the Matanga Sāstra namely, Aniruddha and others have rightly held that the organs of action pervade the entire body as is the case with the organ of touch and become located to particular points on it relating to which specialised functions get used to be discharged.
yassādhanaṃ tadakṣaṃ syāt kiṃtu kasyāpi karmaṇaḥ | etannāsmatkṛtapraśnatṛṣṇāsaṃtāpaśāntaye | |	b-a Now, since there are so many other actions besides those five accomplished by the five organs of action, and hence, therefore, the respective points on the body involved in those actions also need to be given the status of such organs.
nahyasvacchamitaprāyairjalaistṛpyanti barhiṇaḥ | ucyate śrīmatādiṣṭaṃ śaṃbhunātra mamottaram | svacchasaṃvedanodāra vikalāprabalīkṛtam | iha karmātusaṃdhānabhedādekaṃ vibhidyate | | tatrānusaṃdhiḥ pañcātmā pañca karmendriyāṇyataḥ | tyāgāyādānasaṃpattyai dvayāya dvitayaṃ vinā |	b-a Now authorities like Khetapāla and Sadyojyoti also have expressed their views that the organ should be considered that which is the special means of a particular action and not anyone else associated with the action distantly. b-a This, however, is not sufficient to pacify the pain of thirst of the query raised by us, since peacocks do not get satisfied with a small quantity of water and that also polluted. b-a In this regard our answer is the same which has been spelt out by respected Sambhunātha as it is clear, sublimated by direct experience and enforced by pure wisdom.
svarūpaviśrāntikṛte caturdhā karma yadbahiḥ | pāyupāṇyaṅghrijananaṃ karaṇaṃ taccaturvidham |	b-a In view of the two common features of all actions, namely, taking and giving, meant for resting within oneself, external actions are of four kinds for the completion of which we are provided with four organs of action, namely, organ of evacuation, hands, feet and organ of procreation.
antaḥ prāṇāśrayaṃ yattu karmātra karaṇaṃ hi vāk | uktāḥ samāsataṃścaiṣāṃ citrāḥ kāryeṣu vṛttayaḥ |	For the sake of accomplishment of the internal action depending on prāna, we have the organ of speech, vāk. b-a Thus, have been made out in brief the characteristic features of all kinds of action with all their peculiarities.
tadetadvyatiriktaṃ hi na karma kvāpi dṛśyate | tatkasyārthe prakalpyeyamindriyāṇāmaniṣṭhitiḥ |	Any feature of action other than these has nowhere else been observed. For what purpose which organ is meant, this is the determinant in this regard.
etatkartavyacakraṃ tadasāṃkaryeṇa kurvate | ākṣāṇi sahavṛttyā tu buddhyante saṃkaraṃ jaḍāḥ |	b- Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality This is the circle of action of exclusive nature. Organs are cooperative amongst themselves and those are foolish who mistake the same cooperation as dilution, sānkarya.
ukta indriyavargo'yamahaṃkarāt tu rājasāt | tamaḥ pradhānāhaṃkarāt bhoktraṃśacchādanātmanaḥ |	This group of organs is said to have been born of the rajas aspect of the ego-sense.
bhūtādināmnastanmātrapañcakaṃ bhūtakāraṇ | manobuddhyakṣakarmākṣavargastanmātravargakaḥ | ityatra rājasāhaṃkṛdyogaḥ saṃśleṣako dvaye | anye tvāhurmano jātaṃ rājasāhaṃkṛteryataḥ | | samastendriyasaṃcāracaturaṃ laghu vegavat | anye tu sāttvikāt svāntaṃ buddhikarmendriyāṇi tu |	-a Manas, buddhi, organs of sense and action all these are born of the sāttvika aspect of the ego-sense with the involvement of the rājasa aspect of it as the factor of interconnection between the organs and the elements. b-a Some other authorities hold that manas is born of the rājasa aspect of the ego- sense which is obvious from its efficiency in making the entire group of organs conduct its business as also from its quick mobility. As distinct from them, some contend that both the kinds of organ, namely, those of action as well as sense, along with the inner being are born of the sāttvika aspect of the ego-sense and derive their interconnectedness from the rājasa aspect of it.
rājasādgrāhakagrāhyabhāgasparśīni manvate | kheṭapālāstu manyante karmendriyagaṇaḥ sphuṭam | |	b-a Followers of Khetapāla, on the other hand, hold the view that the group of senses of action is obviously born of the rājasa aspect of the ego-sense as it is the rajoguna which is of active nature.
rājasāhaṃkṛterjāto rajasaḥ karmatā yataḥ | śrīpūrvaśāstre tu mano rājasāt sāttvikātpunaḥ |	b-a As against it, the previous text, namely, Mālinivijayottara Tantra holds that while manas is born of the rājasa aspect of the ego-sense, all the organs of sense and action are born of the sāttvika aspect of it.
indriyāṇi samastāni yuktaṃ caitadvibhāti naḥ | tathāhi bāhyavṛttīnāmakṣāṇāṃ vṛttibhāsane |	b- a For instance, while the senses, on account of being extrovert, end up in their function with perception and expression, the power of the manas is applied to managing the same internally.
ālocane śaktirantaryojane manasaḥ punaḥ | uktaṃ ca gurūṇā kuryānmano'nuvyavasāyi sat |	b-a It has been stated by my teacher that action is a result of the efforts put in by the senses and the inner being of the subject in coordination with each other.
atrāvivādaḥ sarvasya grāhyopakrama eva hi | pṛthivyāṃ saurabhānyādivicitre gandhamaṇḍale | yatsāmānyaṃ hi gandhatvaṃ gandhatanmātranāma tat | vyāpakaṃ tata evoktaṃ sahetutvāttu na dhruvam | |	b-a Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality As regards the tanmātrās, their root lies in the tamas-dominated aspect of the ego-sense. There is no difference of opinion amongst the schools of thought that they serve as the object of perception. Whichever kind of smell, good or bad, might be coming to our noses, in any case arises from the earth. The universal of smell is the gandha-tanmātrā.
svakāraṇe tirobhūtirdhvaṃso yattena nādhruvam | evaṃ rasādiśabdāntatanmātreṣvapi yojanā | |	b-a It is pervasive but not eternal as it is an effect and is liable to get merged into its cause. This needs to be taken as applicable to other tanmātrās, namely, taste, form, touch and sound.
viśeṣāṇāṃ yato'vaśyaṃ daśā prāgaviśeṣiṇī | kṣubhitaṃ śabdatanmātraṃ citrākārā śrutīrdadhat | nabhaḥ śabdo'vakāśātmā vācyādhyāsasaho yataḥ | tadetatsparśatanmātrayogāt prakṣobhamāgatam |	b- The reason behind the admittance of tanmātrās is that as they are mere specific attributes, they must presuppose their substantial bases. For instance, sound in all its varieties arises out of the sound-tanmātrā which in itself has its base in space as the carrier of the sound. With the addition of the touch-tanmātrā to that of the sound, the latter assumes the form of air.
vāyutāmeti tenātra śabdasparśobhayātmatā | anye tvāhurdhvaniḥ khaikaguṇastadati yujyate | |	This is why air is the bearer of sound and touch both. -a Some authorities contend that sound alone is the attribute of space, as the existence of air depends on space.
yato vāyurnijaṃ rūpaṃ labhate na vināmbarāt | uttarottarabhūteṣu pūrvapūrvasthitiryataḥ | |	In answer to this contention the position is that on account of the being of the later elements in their prior ones, there is inseparable relationship between air and space.
tata eva marudvyomnoraviyogo mithaḥ smṛtaḥ | śabdasparśī tū rūpeṇa samaṃ prakṣobhamāgatau |	When sound and touch get mixed with form, the agitation generated by the mixture results in the emergence of fire.
tejastattvaṃ tribhirdharmaiḥ prāhuḥ pūrvavadeva tat | taistribhiḥ sarasairāpaḥ sagandhairbhūriti kramaḥ | |	In the same way, when taste is added to these three, the result is emergence of water and with the addition of smell to those four attributes is born the earth. This is the way the elements have emerged.
tatra pratyakṣataḥ siddho dharādiguṇasaṃcayaḥ | nahi gandhādidharmoghavyatiriktā vibhāti bhūḥ |	b- Since the earth has emerged out of the agitation generated by the mixture of the five attributes sound, etc., it has been always considered as possessed of all these attributes. This status of the earth becomes perceptively proved by the fact that nowhere is the earth bereft of these attributes.
yathā guṇaguṇidvaitavādināmekamapyadaḥ | citraṃ rūpaṃ paṭe bhāti kramāddharmāstathā bhuvi | |	As is the case with the upholders of the dualistic view of relationship between the substance and the attributes that a piece of cloth having different kinds of figure drawn on it remains one and the same, even so is the case with the earth imbued with all these five attributes.
yathā ca vistṛte vastre yugapadbhāti citratā | tathaiva yogināṃ dharmasāmastyenāvabhāti bhūḥ |	As drawings appear as one on a large piece of cloth even so appears the earth to the view of yogins in the integrality of all its attributes.
gandhādiśabdaparyantacitrarūpā dharā tataḥ | upāyabhedādbhātyeṣā kramākramavibhāgataḥ | |	Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality As the earth is imbued with all the five attributes from smell to sound in a variegated form, it appears differently to the observer as one as well as many depending on the psychic status of him.
tata eva kramavyaktikṛto dhībheda ucyate | ṣaṣṭhīprayogo dhībhedābhedyabhedakatā tathā | tena dharmātirikto'tra dharmo nāma ca kaścana | tatrānekaprakārāḥ syurgandharūparasāḥ kṣitau |	This is why variation in the outlook towards things is said to have come from differences in the psychic statuses of the observers. Use of the sixth grammatical termination between the substantive and the attributive terms that is, relative, is due to the intellectual or psychic difference from individual to individual concerned. Therefore, it has to be admitted that substance is nothing apart from the attribute.
saṃsparśa pākajo'nuṣṇāśīta śabdo vicitrakaḥ | śaukyaṃ mādhuryaśītatve citrāḥ śabdāśca vāriṇi |	As such, there need to be admitted several kinds of smell, form and taste on the earth as well as touch and sound.
śuklabhāsvaratoṣṇatvaṃ citrāḥ śabdāśca pāvake | apākajaścāśītoṣṇo dhvaniścitraśca mārute |	Sound is also of different kinds and so are touch, form and taste. Examples are cold, white and sweet. Peculiar kinds of sound are produced in water.
varṇātmako dhvaniḥ śabdapratibimbānyathāmbare |	In space also sound produced is of the kind of letters and words as well as of the nature of echo.
yattu na sparśavaddharmaḥ śabda ityādi bhaṇḍayate |	There is nothing to contradict the statement: ‘There is sound in the drum' as being struck it produces sound.
na ca hetutvamātreṇa tadādānatvavedanāt | śrotraṃ cāsmanmate'haṃkṛtkāraṇaṃ tatra tatra tat |	b- Mere presence of the source of sound is not sufficient for the reception of it as the same requires the organ of reception, that is, the ear. In our view, the cause of that organ is the ego-sense, particularly in its aspect dominated by the rajoguna.
vṛttibhāgīti taddeśaṃ śabdaṃ gṛhṇātyalaṃ tathā | yastvāha śrotramākāśaṃ karṇasaṃyogabheditam | śabdajaḥ śabda āgatya śabdabuddhiṃ prasūyate | tasya mande'pi murajadhvanāvākarṇake sati | | amutra śrutireṣeti dūre saṃvedanaṃ katham | nahi śabdajaśabdasya dūrādūraravoditeḥ |	This is obvious from its receptivity of sound and inclination to move to the point wherefrom the sound is being produced. -a Those followers of Kanāda who hold that it is the last echo of the entire chain of sounds which reaching the ear-drum of the listener like the chain of vibration in water, generates the sense of hearing the sound, need to explain how is made possible the listening to sound of a drum being played upon from a distant place as this process of listening involves gradual attenuation of the pitch of it in course of transmission from one step of sound to the other.
śrotrākāśagatasyāsti dūrādūrasvabhāvatā | na cāsau prathamaḥ śabdastāvadvyāpīti yujyate | tatrasthaiḥ saha tīvrātmā śrūyamāṇastvanena tu | kathaṃ śrūyeta mandaḥ sannahi dharmāntarāśrayaḥ |	b-a It is not tenable to suppose that this is made possible owing to the pervasiveness of the initial sound. How is it made possible for the listener at a considerable distance to listen to the sound in the same form from close quarters and that, too, in spite of vast difference in the sharpness of the organ of audition between the two listeners in favour of the closer one particularly when the sound concerned has not undergone any qualitative or quantitative transformation in the process of transmission.
etaccānyairapākāri bahudheti vṛthā punaḥ | nāyastaṃ patitāghātadāne ko hi na paṇḍitaḥ |	b- This view of the Naiyāyikas has been refuted on various grounds by others such as the author of Jyotsnā. As such, it would be improper to cause injury further to one who lies injured already.
amīṣāṃ tu dharādīnāṃ yāvāṃstattvagaṇaḥ purā| guṇādhikatayā tiṣṭhan vyāptā tāvān prakāśate | vyāpyavyāpakatā yaiṣā tattvānāṃ darśitā kila| sā guṇādhikyataḥ siddhā na hetutvānna lāghavāt |	Whichsoever element lies above whichsoever beginning from the earth is permeated by larger quantity of the attribute than what gets manifested in its lower one. The relationship of pervasion and being pervaded by amongst the basic constituents of the Reality that has been explained here in this context is based Sri Tantrāloka on the quantum of the attribute as prevailing in a relatively higher degree in the upper than in the lower.
ahetunāpi rāgo hi vyāpto vidyādinā sphuṭam | tadvinā na bhavedyattadvyāptamityucyate yataḥ |	In the absence of which what has no possibility of coming into being, that is said pervade the latter.
na lāghavaṃ ca nāmāsti kiṃcidatra svadarśane| guṇādhikyādato jñeyā vyāpyavyāpakatā sphuṭā |	In our philosophy there is no place for contingency. Therefore, here one needs to understand the relationship of pervasion and being pervaded by in terms of the degree of quantity of the attribute in ascending order.
yo hi yasmādguṇotkṛṣṭa sa tasmādūrdhva ucyate | ūrdhvatā vyāptṛtā śrīmanmālinīvijaye sphuṭā | |	- Whatever is higher in the degree of attribute is said to lie above the lesser in that respect. Relative height and pervasion have been explained clearly in the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra.
ataḥ śivatvātprabhṛti prakāśatā svarūpamādāya nijātmani dhruvama | samastatattvāvalidharmasaṃcayai vibhāti bhūrvyāptṛtayā sthitairalam |	This is how having drawn its light of consciousness from the state of Śiva and having assimilated the same to itself, the entire row of constituent elements of the world has got permeated by that light in regard to its own respective attribute with the climax being reached in the emergence of the earth with the consolidation of the attributes in it.
evaṃ jalāderapi śaktitattvaparyantadhāmno vapurasti tādṛk | kiṃ tūttaraṃ śaktitayaiva tattvaṃ pūrvaṃ tu taddharmatayeti bhedaḥ |	Exposition on the Constituent Elements of the Reality Thus is formed the body of the respective element from water up to śakti in keeping with the principle of the relationship between the agent and object of pervasion in regard to the quantum of the attribute concerned with this difference, however, that while Sakti goes on becoming stronger subsequently, Siva does the same in course of ascension.
anuttaraprakriyāyāṃ vaitamyena pradarśitam | etat tasmāt tataḥ paśyedvistarārthī vivecakaḥ |	This has been explained in detail in the Parātrisikā. He who is interested in all such details needs to look for it there.
iti tattvasvarūpasya kṛtaṃ samyak prakāśanam |	Thus has been accomplished amply well exposition of the constituent elements of the Reality.
ucyate trikaśāstraikarahasyaṃ tattvabhedam | teṣāmamīṣāṃ tattvānāṃ svavargeṣvanugāminām | bhedāntaramapi proktaṃ śāstre'tra śrītrikābhidhe |	Trika śāstra is characterised by mystery and variety of sub-divisions of entities and principles involved in its formulation. In this śāstra known as Trika, divisions and still further sub-division of principles and elements of their respective groups have been discerned.
śaktimacchaktibhedena dharādyaṃ mūlapaścimam | bhidyate pañcadaśadhā svarūpeṇa sahānarāt |	Beginning from the root in Śiva and ending with the individual, in view of the degree of ingression of the forces and forceful into each other the relevant principles and entities are divided into fifteen.
kalāntaṃ bhedayugdhīnaṃ rudravatpralayākalaḥ | tadvanmāyā ca navadhā jñākalā yaptadhā punaḥ | mantrāstadīśāḥ pāñcadhye mantreśapatayastridhā | śivo na bhidyate svaikaprakāśaghatanacinmayaḥ |	Sri Tantrāloka Beginning from purusa and ending with kalā and including the pralayākala, the number of divisions reaches eleven without taking the count of their pairs. In the same way, there are nine divisions of māyā and seven those of kalā So are the mantras and their presiding deities divisible into five and the Lord of presiding deities of mantras in three forms.
śivo mantramaheśeśamantrā akalayukkalī | śaktimantaḥ sapta tathā śaktayastaccaturdaśa | svaṃ svarūpaṃ pañcadaśaṃ tadbhūḥ pañcadaśātmikā	Seven are the factors imbued with the force, namely, Śiva, Mantra Mahesvara, Mantreśvara, Mantra, Vijñānākala, Pralayākala and Sakala while their Forces are fourteen. By adding to these fourteen forms the own form of the earth, all become fifteen.
tathāhi tisro devasya śaktayo varṇitāḥ purā |	The three forces referred to already in the form of the knower, process of knowing and the object of knowledge have been settled as really the forces of the Lord Himself.
tā eva mātṛmānameyatrairūpyeṇa vyavasthitāḥ | parāṃśo mātrarūpo'tra pramāṇāṃśa parāparaḥ | meyo'paraḥ śaktimāṃśca śaktiḥ svaṃ rūpamityadaḥ | tatra svarūpaṃ bhūmeryatpṛthagjaḍamavasthitam |	-a Out of these three forces, the transcendent one is the knower represented by Śiva Himself, the higher and the lower are combined forms of the standard of knowledge while Sakti stands for her own form in the shape of the object of knowledge. b-a Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... In the determination of these forms of the combination of Śiva and Śakti, the earth stands out as all inanimate having nothing to do with the knower and the standard of knowing, etc.
mātṛmānādyupādhibhirasaṃjātoparāgakam | sakalādiśivāntaistu mātṛbhirvedyatāsya yā |	b-a The capacity of the earth as the object of knowledge of the agents from kalā to Siva remains dominated by the possessors of force who are always aware of their possession since the forces become awakened in them.
vedyatājanitāḥ sapta bhedā iti caturdaśa | sakalasya pramāṇāṃśo yo'sau vidyākalātmakaḥ |	This kind of knowledge is of seven kinds adding the same number to the earlier seven ones raising it to fourteen. b- One who is under the limitations of kalā, his standard of knowledge remains limited to vidyā.
sāmānyātmā sa śaktitve gaṇito na tu tadbhadaḥ | layākalasya manāṃśaḥ sa eva paramasphuṭaḥ |	He lives a commonplace pattern of life noted for dominance of force in him without any capacity to break through this limitation.
jñānākalasya mānaṃ tu galadvidyākalāvṛti | aśuddhavidyākalanādhvaṃsasaṃskārasaṃgā | prabubhutsuḥ śuddhavidyā mantrāṇāṃ karaṇaṃ bhavet | sabuddhā śuddhavidyā tu tatsaṃskāreṇa saṃgatā |	In layākala, the standard of knowledge becomes prominent while in jñānākala the same standard reaches the stage where its vidyā and kalā both come to the point of getting removed along with the impure knowledge, aśuddha vidyā, arriving to the point of complete elimination along with its impressions. b- Coming to predominance the pure knowledge śuddha vidyā, has the potentiality of operation as the instrument of mantras and having been awakened gets associated with its effects on the psychic being.
mānaṃ mantreśvarāṇāṃ syāttatsaṃskāravivarjitā | mānaṃ mantramaheśānāṃ karaṇaṃ śaktirucyate |	The standard of knowledge of those who have become rulers over mantras needs to have become rid of the impressions of māyā and kalā both while the same standard has the possibility of getting transferred into the force of the Sakti in the Mantra Maheśas.
svātantryamātrasadbhāvā yā tvicchāśaktiraiśvarī | śivasya saiva karaṇaṃ tayā veti karoti ca |	The will-power of īśvara characterised by exclusive autonomy serves as the instrument of knowledge and action in Siva.
ā śivātsakalāntaṃ ye mātaraḥ sapta te dvidhā | nyagbhūtodriktaśaktitvāttadbhedo vedyabhedakaḥ |	The status of knowers from Śiva to the individual comprises seven ones which being divided into categories, that is, those in whom the force remains downgraded and those in whom it becomes awakened counts to fourteen.
tathā hi vedyatā nāma bhāvasyaiva nijaṃ vapuḥ | caitreṇa vedyaṃ vedmīti kiṃ hyatra pratibhāsatām | nanu caitrīyavijñānamātramatra prakāśate | vedyatākhyastu no dharmo bhāti bhāvasya nīlavat |	The locus of ownership remains confined to the personality of the knower himself without affecting the status of the object of knowledge. Does it make any difference in the status of Caitra by someone's statement that I know Caitra' and then someone else's observation that I know Caitra as he was known to Maitra'? Tattvādhvan Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
vedyatā ca svabhāvena dharmo bhāvasya cettataḥ| sarvānpratyeva vedyaḥ syādghaṭanīlādidharmavat |	If knowableness were the natural quality of any object, the object concerned ought to be known to everybody automatically as is the case with a blue pitcher whose blueness, for instance, is imperceptible to the blind.
atha vedakasaṃvittibalādvedyatvadharmabhāk | bhāvastathāpi doṣo'sau kuvindakṛtavastravat | vedyatākhyastu yo dharmaḥ so'vedyaścetkhapuṣpavat | vedyaścedasti tatrāpi vedyatetyanavasthitiḥ |	However, this statement requires some specification as is the case of relationship between the cloth and its weaver. If the quality of knowableness were to be changed into unknowableness as is the case with the sky-flower, there would occur the flaw since the knowableness of any object would come to depend on the being of the object concerned and vice versa.
tato na kiṃcidvedyaṃ syānmūrchitaṃ tu jagadbhavet | nanu vijñānupādhyaṃśopaskṛtaṃ vapurucyatām |	Under such a circumstance, nothing would be there to be known resulting in the fall of the entire universe into the state of swoon.
bhāvasyārthaprakāśātma yathā jñānamidaṃ tvasat | ekavijñātṛvedyatve na jñātrantaravedyatā |	-a Now, if the form of the object of knowledge were to be considered as having been shaped by a fraction of the adjunct of the knower, known as knowableness of it, this would not stand the test as is the case with this knowledge itself.
samastajñātṛvedyatve naikavijñātṛvedyatā | tasmānna vedyatā nāma bhāvadharmo'sti kaścana |	Therefore, it would have to be admitted that there is no such a quality as knowableness independent in itself but just an aspect of the arousal of the awareness.
bhāvasya vedyatā saiva saṃvido yaḥ samudbhavaḥ | arthagrahaṇarūpaṃ hi yatra vijñānamātmani |	b-a Reception of the object of perception is awareness within the perceiver of the object concerned as exposed before him. This is the knowableness of the object of perception confined to the perceiver rather than being anyway inherent in the object.
samavaiti prakāśyo'rthastaṃ pratyeṣaiva vedyatā | atra brūmaḥ padārthānāṃ na dharmo yadi vedyatā |	If knowableness were not an inherent quality of the object of knowledge, it is likely to remain unknown even after undergoing the process of perception as recounted in the previous verse.
avedyā eva te saṃsyurjñāne satyapi varṇite| yathā hi pṛthubudhnādirūpe kumbhasya satyapi | atadātmā paṭo naiti pṛthubudhnādirūpatām| tathā satyapi vijñāne vijñātṛsamavāyini | avedyadharmakā bhāvāḥ kathaṃ vedyatvamāpnuyuḥ | anarthaḥ sumahāścaiṣa dṛśyatāṃ vastu yatsvayam |	b-a As in spite of being known as possessed of a stout bottom etc., a piece of cloth cannot assume the same shape though being equally knowable, even so the knowledge being inherent in the knower notwithstanding, how can it be Tattvādhvan Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... possible for the objects bereft of knowableness to come under the purview of knowledge? b-a This idea would lead to a terrible travesty of the entire outlook as not only the object of knowledge would have to be admitted as shorn of knowableness but the consciousness also bereft of the power of luminosity.
prakāśātma na tatsaṃviccāprakāśā tadāśrayaḥ | aprakāśo manodīpacakṣurādi tathaiva tat | kiṃ tatprakāśatāṃ nāma supte jagati sarvataḥ | jñānasyārthaprakāśatvaṃ nanu rūpaṃ pradīpavat |	For instance, if the lamp of mind and senses were to be made shorn of the power of illumination, the entire world would virtually become asleep leaving nothing to be illumined nor to be perceived . Similar to the light of lamp is the luminosity of objects imparted by knowledge.
apūrvamatra viditaṃ narīnṛtyāmahe tataḥ | arthaprakāśo jñānasya yadrūpaṃ tannirūpyatām |	b- Here arises a unique situation in regard to knowledge owing to which we cannot but have to dance. Therefore it has become necessary for us to elaborate on the sense of the expression, artha-prakāśa.
arthaprakāśaścedrūpamartho vā jñānameva vā | athārthasya prakāśo yastadrūpamiti bhaṇyate |	In the case of being taken as a copulative compound, it would mean the object and the illumination while in the case of being taken as the relative it would amount to knowledge of the object.
ṣaṣṭhī kartari cedukto doṣa eva duruddharaḥ | atha karmaṇi ṣaṣṭhyeṣā ṇyarthastatra hṛdi sthitaḥ | |	If the use of the sixth termination in the word artha be admitted as in the sense of the nominative case, it would be difficult to avoid the difficulty. If, therefore, it is taken as used in the objective sense, the causative would have to be admitted as involved in the usage.
tathā cedaṃ darśayāmaḥ kiṃ prakāśa prakāśate | aprakāśo'pi naivāsau tathāpi ca na kiṃcana |	As such, we have to determine as to what is the object to be illumined. If that object is bereft of light, it would have to be taken as amounting to nothing.
tahiṃ loke kathaṃ ṇyarthaḥ ucyate cetanasthitau | mukhyo ṇyarthasya viṣayo jaḍeṣu tvaupacārikaḥ | | tathā hi gantuṃ śakto'pi caitro'nyāyattatāṃ gateḥ | manvāna eva vaktyasmi gamitaḥ svāmineti hi | svāmyapyasya gatau śaktiṃ buddhavā svādhīnatāṃ sphuṭam | paśyannivṛttimāśaṃkya gamayāmīti bhāṣate |	In answer to the query what then is the significance of the usage of the causative in this context, the answer is the causative sense becomes main if applied to the animate and sheer formal when applied to the inanimate. If a person named Caitra, even though capable of moving by himself independently, is made to go to a certain place, being asked for his coming, he is liable to answer to the enquirer in this regard that he has been sent by his employer. His employer, too, having been aware of Caitra's capability of going to the place concerned, says that he has made him to go. Thus becomes obvious the basic relationship between two animate entities as Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
preryaprerakayorevaṃ maulikī ṇyarthasaṃgatiḥ | tadabhiprāyato'nyo'pi loke vyavaharettathā |	the mover and the moved. In the same sense may operate people in the actual life also.
śaraṃ gamayatītyatra punarvegākhyasaṃskriyām | vidadhatprerakammanya upacāreṇa jāyate |	‘The shooter sends the arrow.' In this usage, the shooter invests the impression of movement in the arrow and, therefore, just analogically is said to have instigated the arrow to meet the target and not really since being inanimate the arrow cannot be instigated.
vāyuradriṃ pātayatītyatra dvāvapi tau jaḍau | draṣṭṛbhi prerakapreryavapuṣā parikalpitau | |	'The wind makes the peak of the mountain fall.' In this usage both the instigator and the instigated are inanimate and, therefore, neither of them is liable to come under the purview of the act of instigation . As such, the act of instigation between them is obviously the result of imputation of the role of the subject and the object on them by the visitors of the scene.
itthaṃ jaḍena saṃbandhe na mukhyā ṇyarthasaṃgatiḥ | āstāmanyatra vitatametadvistarato mayā |	In this way is explicable the usage of the causative form of the expression in the case of inanimate objects. Let us stop with this much deliberation on this topic since it has already been detailed by me elsewhere.
artha prakāśanā seyamupacārastato bhavet | astu cedbhāsate tarhi sa eva patadadrivat |	Therefore, illumination of the object by its knowledge also must be analogical. Illumination of the object in this expression is analogical to the falling of the peak.
upacāre nimittena kenāpi kila bhūyate | vāyuḥ pātayatītyatra nimittaṃ tatkṛtā kriyā |	In analogy, some cause of it is a necessity. ‘Wind makes the peak fall', in this statement cause is the action of the wind.
girau yenaiṣa saṃyoganāśād bhraṃśaṃ prapadyate | iha tu jñānamarthasya na kiṃcitkarameva tat | |	It is due to that action that the association between them comes to an end and the peak falls. In the case of illumination of the object by knowledge, however, the latter does not make any change in the object at all through its act of illumination.
upacāraḥ kathaṃ nāma bhavetso'pi hyavastu san | aprakāśita evārthaḥ prakāśatvopacārataḥ | tādṛgeva śiśuḥ kiṃ hi dahatyagnyupacārataḥ | śiśau vahnhyupacāre yadbījaṃ taikṣṇyādi tacca sat |	Under such a state of things, how can analogy and that also being a non-entity, be fit for being treated as an analogy ? -a In response to the above objection what needs to be understood is that the known object in this context, too, does not get illumined anyway actually but only analogically in the same way as happens in the statement: Mānavako'gnih, child is fire. Does the child burn anyone like fire? Not at all.
prakāśatvopacāre tū kiṃ bījaṃ yatra satyatā | siddhe hi cetane yukta upacāraḥ sa hi sphuṭam |	What truth after all lies behind the act of knowing as a fact of illumination? b-a Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... This is obvious that the analogy is appropriate so far as the animate is concerned.
adhyāropātmakaḥ so'pi pratisaṃdhānajīvitaḥ | na cādyāpi kimapyasti cetanaṃ jñānamapyadaḥ | aprakāśaṃ tadanyena tatprakāśe'pyayaṃ vidhiḥ| nanu pradīpo rūpasya prakāśaḥ kathamīdṛśam | atrāpi na vahantyetāḥ kiṃ nu yuktivikalpanāḥ | yādṛśā svena rūpeṇa dīpo rūpaṃ prakāśayet |	This, however, is of the nature of superimposition which, too, is dependent on the being of the agency of the counter-association which, too, has not come into being till date. Consequently, knowledge as the parameter of animateness has remained devoid of illumination, standing in need of being illumined by something else like the Ātman, self. b-a Now the problem is whether the illumination of the object concerned is somewhat like the same by knowledge ? b Do these arguments not carry any weight here too ? a By means of which flame the lamp illuminates the object by the same it illumines itself also.
tādṛśā svayamapyeṣa bhāti jñānaṃ tu no tathā | pradīpaścaiva bhāvānāṃ prakāśatvaṃ dadhātyalam | anyathā na prakāśerannabhede cedṛśo vidhiḥ |	That, however, is not the case with knowledge. b-a The lamp is sufficiently possessed of the property of illuminating the objects. In the absence of that property common to both the lamp and the object, the latter would not have been subjected to illumination at all.
tasmātprakāśa evāyaṃ pūrvoktaḥ paramaḥ śivaḥ |	b-a This is why the Parama Śiva, as discussed already has been considered as sheer light.
yathā yathā prakāśeta tattadbhāvavapuḥ sphuṭam | evaṃ na nīlatā nāma yathā kācitprakāśate |	As He goes on shedding His Light, the universe goes on assuming its form as His obvious body. b-a As blueness spreads its illumination, so does spread out the object its knowableness which is of existential nature.
tadvaccakāsti vedyatvaṃ tacca bhāvāṃśapṛṣṭhagam | phalaṃ prakaṭatārthasya saṃvidveti dvayaṃ tataḥ | vipakṣato rakṣitaṃ ca saṃdhānaṃ cāpi tanmithaḥ | tathā hi nibhṛtaścauraścaitravedyamiti sphuṭam |	b-a In reconciliation of the two mutually contrary opinions regarding the event of knowing an object as propounded by Kumārila with the assertion that knowledge of the object is based on the element of revelation prakatatā inherent in it, and by Prabhākara that the same has its basis in the consciousness inherent in the knower, we admit that both are correct from their own viewpoints and, therefore, unification of both the viewpoints is the necessity.
buddhvā nādatta evāśu parīpsāvivaśo'pi san | seyaṃ paśyati māṃ netratribhāgeneti sādaram |	b-a This may be elucidated by the case of a thief looking at a precious possession of Caitra and while intending to steal it out of greed does not dare to grab it out of the fear that he has been seen stealing it by its owner.
svaṃ dehamamṛteneva siktaṃ paśyati kāmukaḥ | na caitajjñānasaṃvittimātraṃ bhāvāṃśapṛṣṭhagam | arthakriyākaraṃ taccenna dharmaḥ ko nvasau bhavet | yaccoktaṃ vedatādharmo bhāvaḥ sarvānapi prati | |	b-a It is obvious from the above instances that the knowledge of an object is not merely awareness of it but involves in it the will for the corresponding action. If the same were not to involve the will for action in regard to the object, knowableness of it as its inherent quality rather than just as a contingent function, would stand annulled.
syādityetatsvapakṣadhnaṃ duṣprayogāstravattava | asmākaṃ tu svaprakāśaśivatāmātravādinām |	b-a As regards our standpoint, we hold the view that Siva alone is self-luminous and it is He who forms the source of illumination of all out of His sense of independence and self-sufficiency and hence acts as the determinant in regard to knowledge as well as existence, sat and cit.
anyaṃ prati cakāstīti vaca eva na vidyate | sarvānprati ca tannīlaṃ sa ghaṭaśceti yadvacaḥ | |	As such, nothing else needs to be uttered in this regard. b-a As regards the statement that the particular object is blue and therefore is a pitcher, such a statement is made almost out of ignorance and is mistaken to be true only by the ignorant.
tadapyaviditaprāyaṃ gṛhītaṃ mugdhabuddhibhiḥ | na hi kālāgnirudrīyakāyāvagatanīlimā | tava nīlaḥ kiṃ nu pīto maivaṃ bhūnna tu nīlakaḥ | na kaṃcitprati nīlo'sau nīlo vā yaṃ prati sthitaḥ |	b-a Blueness essentially is the colour of the body of Rudra, the deity of the fire of dissolution. It does not apply to the colour blue as perceived by individuals; then if the question arises whether it would turn into yellow. The answer to this question is that this, too, is not possible. If it looks blue to someone, it ought to be limited to him alone particularly as confined to his determination at last.
taṃ pratyeva sa vedyaḥ syātsaṃkalpadvārako'ntataḥ | yathā cārthaprakāśātmajñānaṃ saṃgīryate tvayā |	b-a If you agree with the formulation that the knowledge of a particular object amounts to be illuminated as such by the tool of understanding, you need also to agree with the view that this knowledgeableness is existential bhāviya.
tathā tajjñātṛvedyatvaṃ bhāvīyaṃ rūpamucyatām | na ca jñātātra niyataḥ kaścijjñāne yathā tava |	b-a We do not agree with your viewpoint that the knower is different from the object of knowledge. As against this viewpoint, we hold that whoever acts as the knower of what, forms the body of that knowledge in the form of his own personality.
arthe jñātā yadā yo yastadvedyaṃ vapurucyatām | tattadvijñātṛvedyatvaṃ sarvānpratyeva bhāsatām |	b-a The opposition seems to have crossed the limit of deftness in asserting the point again and again that on agreeing to the viewpoint that knowledgeableness is existential, knowledge of everything would become common to all.
ityevaṃ codayanmanye vrajedbadhiradhuryatām | na hyānyaṃ prati vai kaṃcidbhāti sā vedyatā tathā |	In fact, knowingness of one does never become precisely the same of anyone else. b-a What decentralisation lies in holding knowingness as existential ? Indeed, by sticking to this point of view, the flaw gets annulled. Its status is also not kindred to that of the blue, etc.
bhāvasya rūpamityukte keyamasthānavaidhurī | anena nītimārgeṇa nirmūlamapasāritā |	Knowingness, in fact, is that attribute by virtue of which Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
anavasthā tathā hyanyairnīlādyaiḥ sadṛśī na sā | vedyatā kiṃtu dharmo'sau yadyogātsarvadharmavān | dharmī vedyatvamabhyeti sa sattāsamavāyavat | brūṣe yathā hi kurute sattā satyataḥ sataḥ |	the entire world becomes existential. Indeed, the whole knowableness becomes substantial on account of its inherence in existence. -a You utter as per practice in the world that existence is derived from non- existence; inherence is derived from the unassociated and the associated; the last is derived as a particular via elimination of what are not eliminated; so is the case with whiteness making the black white.
samavāyo'pi saṃśliṣṭaḥ śliṣṭānaśliṣṭatājuṣaḥ | antyo viśeṣo vyāvṛttirūpo vyāvṛttivarjitān |	Similar is the case of the moving according movement to the stagnant.
vyāvṛttān śvetimā śuklamaśuklaṃ gamanaṃ tathā | tadvannīlādidharmāṃśayukto dharmo svayaṃ sthitaḥ |	In the same way, objects such as blue, etc., being unknown, enter into the class of the known by virtue of the entry of the attribute of knowingness into them.
avedyo vedyatārūpāddharmādvedyatvamāgataḥ | vedyatā bhāsamānā ca svayaṃ nīlādidharmavat | |	b-a Knowingness appearing by itself as blue, etc. should reveal itself automatically as equipped with the quality of knowingness, in spite of being shorn of the quality of revealment.
nānyā kācidapekṣāsya kṛtakṛtyasya sarvataḥ | yathā ca śivanāthena svātantryāāsyate bhidā | nīlādivattathaivāyaṃ vedyatā dharma ucyate |	b-a When the entire world rests in the illumination of consciousness, there is no necessity of anything else to bring the illumination of awareness to it as it lies fulfilled in all respects already. b-a As the entire spectrum of the world is being revealed in all multiplicity by Lord Siva, likewise needs to be taken the attribute of knowingness such as the blue, etc.
evaṃ siddhaṃ hi vedyatvaṃ bhāvadharmo'stu kā ghṛṇā |	b-a Thus gets established the existential character of knowingness without any sense of repulsion.
idaṃ tu cintyaṃ sakalaparyantoktapramātṛbhiḥ | vedyatvamekarūpaṃ syāccāturdaśyamataḥ kutaḥ | ucyate paripūrṇaṃ cedbhāvīyaṃ rūpamucyate | tadvibharbhairavo devo bhagavāneva bhaṇyate | |	Still, however, the problem remains to be settled that when knowingness beginning from Siva to the unenlightened individual is all the way uniformly one, what is the necessity for dividing it into fourteen kinds? b- In response to this objection, the author observes as follows : When the completely existential status of knowingness is being spelled out, it is to be understood as being done directly by the Lord Himself.
atha tannijamāhātmyakalpitoṃ'śāṃśikākramaḥ | sahyate kiṃ kṛtaṃ tarhi proktakalpanayā'nayā | ata eva yadā yena vapuṣā bhāti yadyathā | tadā tathā tattadrūpamityeṣopaniṣatparā |	Now when all this division into part and whole as well as of order and disorder is being tolerated with by according to it the status of the creation of the Lord out of His magnanimity, what purpose is served by adding to it the idea of further divisions of kinds and varieties ? In answer to this query, the author observes as follows : the secret of our system is that whatever when and in what form reveals itself we take it as such. Tattvädhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
caitreṇa vedyaṃ jānāmi dvābhyāṃ bahubhirapyatha | mantreṇa tanmaheśena śivenodriktaśaktinā | |	'I know this as informed about it by Caitra'. Thus one, two or many agencies may be involved in my knowledge about something up to Mantra and even the supernal Lord of all the mantras imbued with His force.
anyādṛśena vetyevaṃ bhāvo bhāti yathā tathā | arthakriyādivaicitryamabhyetyaparisaṃkhyayā |	Similarly may be the case of information about so many other things in the process of understanding. Thus emerges the peculiarity in regard to the understanding as well as action so far as numeration is concerned.
tathā hyekāgrasakalasāmājikajanaḥ khalu | nṛttaṃ gītaṃ sudhāsārasāgaratvena manyate | | tata evocyate mallanaṭaprekṣopadeśane| sarvapramātṛtādātmyaṃ pūrṇarūpānubhāvakam |	- As an elucidation of this form of understanding is the case of the audience attending a performance of dance and music attentively and consequently feeling bathed, as it were, in the sea of ambrosia. Even so happens in the case of the performance of wrestlers, acrobats, etc.
tāvanmātrārthasaṃvittituṣṭāḥ pratyekaśo yadi | kaḥ saṃbhūya guṇasteṣāṃ pramātraikyaṃ bhavecca kim | yadā tu tattadvedyatvadharmasaṃdarbhagarbhitam | tadvastu śuṣkātprāgrūpādanyaktamidaṃ tadā | |	before the gathering of onlookers who becomes completely identified with whatever is being displayed in spite of all their individual differences. When a large number of people become satisfied each with a particular experience common to them all, what is that experience where this unanimity of satisfaction takes place ? This point of unanimity of satisfaction is reached when the earlier dry state of individual experience gets transcended.
śāstre'pi tattadvedyatvaṃ viśiṣṭārthakriyākaram | bhūyasaiva tathā ca śrīmālinīvijayottare | |	Like the experience of unanimity on the ordinary worldly plane, the same kind of unanimity occurs rather in a profound measure in Saivism as has been pointed out in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra.
tathā ṣaḍvidhamadhvānamanenādhiṣṭhitaṃ smaret | adhiṣṭhānaṃ hi devena yadviśvasya pravedanam |	In this regard, one should remind oneself of the six varieties of the path presided over by the Lord with the involvement of His creativity in the task as also His experience of it.
tadīśavedyatvenetyaṃ jñānaṃ prakṛtakāryakṛt | evaṃ siddhaṃ vedyatākhyo dharmo bhāvasya bhāsate |	-a Thus becomes proved the proposition that it is the property of knowingness of the existential entity which reveals itself. In the state of the entity's remaining unrevealed and self-contained lies what is known as its original status.
tadanābhāsayoge tu svarūpamiti bhaṇyate | upādhiyogitāśaṅkāmapahastayato'sphuṭam |	b-a After the removal of the adjunct, which is the cause of ambiguity of it, when the object gets restored to its original shape, therein lies its revealment in its real being.
ghaṭa eva svarūpeṇa bhāta ityupadiśyate | nanu tatra svayaṃvedyabhāvo mantrādyapekṣayā |	In this statement, the jar concerned is revealed in its original form rid of any adjunct. This may be claimed. Behind the claim, the idea is that the jar is known to the knower by himself without any aid whichsoever, including mantra, etc.
api cāstyeva tanvastu na tu sanpratibhāsate | avedyameva kālāgnivapuroḥ parā diśaḥ | |	There may be a case in which something, though existing, and yet is not revealed to someone. For instance, the fire of dissolution must be there and yet is not knowable to us. So is the case with the sense of direction beyond the mount Meru.
mameti saṃvidi paraṃ śuddhaṃ vastu prakāśate | bhātatvādvedyamapi tanna vedyatvena bhāsanāt |	In it, pure awareness of things gets reflected. It is not untrue to say that since anything is being revealed, therefore, it is knowable also. The truth is that its revealment should be knowable.
avedyameva bhānaṃ hi tathā kamanuyujmahe | evaṃ pañcadaśātmeyaṃ dharā tadvajjalādayaḥ |	- Who is the cognisant behind the revealment of what is unknowable ? This is the problem with the statement that this earth has fifteen attributes. So is the problem also with other elements including water, etc.
avyaktāntā yato'styeṣāṃ sakalaṃ prati vedyatā |	up to the Unmanifest concerning the knowableness of them to the individual enwrapped in ignorance.
yattūcyate kalādyena dharāntena samanvitāḥ | | sakalā iti tatkośaṣaṭkodrekopalakṣaṇam | udbhūtāśuddhacidrāgakalādirasakañcukāḥ |	-a As regards the characterisation of the individuals known as sakala as associated with elements from kalā to dharā, it amounts to suggest to their remaining under the agitated state of six coverings of māyā, niyati, kalā, kāla, rāga and avidyā.
sakalālayasaṃjñāstu nyagbhūtākhilakañcukāḥ | jñānākalāstu dhvastaitatkañcukā iti nirṇayaḥ | |	As distinct from them, sakalālayas are those in whom these kañcukas, coverings, have become attenuated while jñānākalas are those in whom these have become completely eliminated.
tena pradhāne vedye'pi pumānudbhūtakañcuka | pramātāstyeva sakala pāścadaśyamataḥ sthitamaḥ | |	b- In spite of predominance of knowingness in him, the individual attributed as sakala, remains within the range of agitated kañcuka and hence within the fold of the fifteenth.
pāścadaśyaṃ dharādyantarniviṣṭe sakale'pi ca | sakalāntaramastyeva prameye'trāpi mātṛ hi |	As the boundary of the fifteen elements is admitted in the case of the earth, etc. on account of the predominance of knowableness in them, even so it ought to be accepted in the case of the knower also.
sthūlāvṛtādisaṃkocatadanyavyāptṛtājuṣaḥ | pītādyāḥ sthirakampratvāccaturdaśa dharādiṣu | |	Gross covert, beginning, contracted, expanded, pervasive, yellow, etc., stagnant, forceful, etc. are fourteen elements qualified by these attributes from the earth up to the unmanifest.
svarūpībhūtajaḍatāḥ prāṇadehapathe tataḥ | pramātṛtājuṣaḥ proktā dhāraṇā vijayottare |	These attributes are the cause of inanimateness on the path of emergence of prāna and body. This is why in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra these have been characterised as accompanied by knowership.
yadā tu meyatā puṃsaḥ kalāntasya prakalpyate | tadudbhūtaḥ kañcukāṃśo meyo nāsya pramātṛtā |	- Wherever the Purusa still associated with the principle of kalā has got illuminated is conceived as an object of knowledge, what is really meant as that object is indeed the covering over him and by no means he as the knower.
ataḥ sakalasaṃjñasya pramātṛtvaṃ na vidyate | trayodaśatvaṃ tacchaktiśaktimavayavarjanāt |	Therefore, the Purusa still associated with the principle of kalā is bereft of knowership and hence also that of his status as the thirteenth on account of elimination of the principles of Śakti and the possessor of Śakti from him.
nyūgbhūtakañcuko mātā yuktastatra layākalaḥ | māyāniviṣṭo vijñānākalādyāḥ prāgvadeva tu |	The knower with an attenuated form of kañcuka then gets raised to the status of layākala though still he would continue to remain occupied by the element of māyā.
māyātattve jñeyarūpe kañcukanyagbhavo'pi yaḥ | so'pi meyaḥ kañcukaikyaṃ yato māyā susūkṣmikā | vijñānākala evātra tato mātāpakañcuka | māyāniviṣṭe'pyakale tathetyekādaśātmatā |	Since the element of māyā is an object of knowledge, representing the state of attention of the kañcuka, that, too, is the object on account of its identification with the kañcuka which is due to its extreme subtlety. Here the Purusa gets elevated to the status of the vijñānākala and becomes rid of the kañcuka and hence the pure knower.
vijñānakevale vedye kañcukadhvaṃsasusthite | udbubhūṣuprabodhānāṃ mantrāṇāmeva mātṛtā |	When the vijñānākala person in whom special knowledge becomes prominent, becomes the object of knowledge and his kañcuka gets eliminated, resulting in the awakening of wisdom, only mantras serve as the agent of knowledge.
te'pi mantrā yadā meyāstadā mātā tadīśvaraḥ | sa hyudbhavātpūrṇabodhastasminprāpte tu meyatām | udbhūtapūrṇarūpo'sau mātā mantramaheśvaraḥ | tasminvijñeyatāṃ prāpte svaprakāśaḥ paraḥ śivaḥ | |	Sri Tantraloka When those mantras themselves become objects of knowledge, the knower becomes their Lord and he, too, attains the status of the object of knowledge owing to arousal of complete wisdom in him. Due to arousal of complete wisdom in him, he becomes the knower of the status of Mantra Maheśvara and further gets elevated to the ultimate status of Śiva the self-illumined with the awakening of the still higher wisdom in him.
pramātā svakatādātmyabhāsitākhilavedyakaḥ | śivaḥ pramātā no meyo hyanyādhīnaprakāśatā |	-a Siva is the knower of the highest order in whom objectivity has completely been eliminated as He is the self-luminous Lord of everything.
svaprakāśe'tra kasmiṃścidanabhyupagate sati | aprakāśātprakāśatve hyanavasthā duruttarā| tataśca suptaṃ viśvaṃ syānna caivaṃ bhāsate hi tat | |	b-a At this most primeval state of being if we fail to admit the being of anything self- luminous and think of emergence of light from darkness, there will necessarily occur the flaw resulting in the admittance of the entire world as completely asleep.
anyādhīnaprakāśaṃ hi tadbhātyanyastvasau śivaḥ | ityasya svaprakāśatve kimanyairyuktiḍambaraiḥ |	In the face of this danger, admittance of Śiva's self-luminousness becomes a necessity requiring nothing else to support this contention. Individual's conscience is the highest measuring standard conceivable.
upadeśopadeṣṭṛtvavyavahāro'nyathā katham | satyaṃ sa tu tathā sṛṣṭaḥ parameśena vedyatām |	This has been stated right in the beginning. b-a Now, in self-luminous Siva also there is a kind of objectivity insofar as there is prevalence of the relationship of instructor and instruction as related to Him. b-a This is true.
nīto mantramaheśādikakṣyāṃ samadhiśāyyate | tathābhūtaśca vedyo'sau nānavacchinnasaṃvidaḥ |	He has been created by the Supreme Lord such as imbued with objectivity so as to act in the role of Mantra Maheśvara, etc. beyond His regular activities.
pūrṇasya vedyatā yuktā parasparavirodhataḥ | tathā vedyasvabhāve'pi vastuto na śivātmatām | ko'pi bhāvaḥ projjhatīti satyaṃ tadbhāvanā phalet | śrīpūrvaśāstre tenoktaṃ śivaḥ sākṣānna bhidyate |	Admittance of the combination of subjectivity and objectivity is quite understandable in what is perfect, apparently self-contradictory though. b-a In spite of His being imbued with the objectivity of that sort also, there is nothing in the entire spectrum of the reality which is shorn of His presence so as to remain fruitless on contemplation on Him as such. b-a He Himself has stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra that as a whole there is no sāksat, diversity in Śiva.
sākṣātpadenāyamarthaḥ samasta prasphuṭīkṛtaḥ |	Use of the word sākşat in this context stands for 'as a whole'.
nanvekarūpatāyuktaḥ śivastadvaśato bhavet | | trivedatāmantramahānāthe kātra vivāditā | maheśvareśamantrāṇāṃ tathā kevalinordvayoḥ |	b-a Now, even though Siva may be uniformly one on account of having consciousness as His body but what the reason behind reference to Him is as imbued with the triplicity of knowledge in the form of Mantreśa, Mantreśvara and Mahamantreśvara.
anantabhedataikaikaṃ sthitā sakalavatkila | tato layākale meye pramātāsti layākalaḥ |	b-a Of each one of Mantra Maheśvara, Mantreśvara, Vjñāna-kevali and Pralaya- kevali innumerable kinds are possible to be made out as is the case with the Sakalas. b-a Similar would be the case with the Layākala.
atastrayodaśatvaṃ syāditthaṃ naikādaśātmatā | vijñānākalavedyatve'pyanyo jñānākalo bhavet | |	When he would turn into the object of knowledge, his another phase would become the knower of the thirteen kinds apart from the nine getting annulled. b-a Similarly, when the Vijñānākala would become the object of knowledge, his another phase would become the agent of knowledge, and thus he, as the knower, would assume eleven kinds rather than be limited to nine.
mātā tadekādaśatā syānnaiva tu navātmatā | evaṃ mantratadīśānāṃ mantreśāntarasaṃbhave |	b-a Tattvādhvan Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... So is the possibility of multiplication of Mantras and Mantreśvaras.
vedyatvānnava sapta syuḥ sapta pañca tu te katham | ucyate satyamastyeṣā kalanā kiṃtu susphuṭaḥ |	Having become objects of knowledge, they would become nine and seven rather than would remain seven and five. b-a It is obviously true in regard to those who are enwrapped in the element of kalā but decidedly not true in the case of those who have got free of it.
caturdaśavidhasyāsya sakalasyāsti bheditā | layākale tu saṃskāramātrātsatyapyasau bhidā | |	b-a As regards the category of these Sakalas, along with the possibility of innumerable subdivisions of them, in their main divisions they are as many as fourteen.
akalena viśeṣāya sakalasyaiva yujyate | vijñānakevalādīnāṃ tāvatyapi na vai bhidā | śivasvācchandyamātraṃ tu bhedāyaiṣāṃ vijṛmbhate | ityāśayena saṃpaśyanviśeṣaṃ sakalādiha | |	b-a Though varieties are there amongst the Layākalas, yet only in the form of impressions sanskāras to be specified by those who are free of the element of kalā. However, varieties are quite obvious in the case of one who is enwrapped in kalā. b-a As regards the Vijñānākala and others of the sort, there is no variation amongst them at all except for such which comes to the fore on account of the autonomous nature of Siva.
layākalādau novāca trāyodaśyādikaṃ vibhuḥ |	b-a In view of their difference from those who lie still enclosed in the grip of kalā, the Lord did not speak of variation into varieties of thirteen, etc.
nanvastu vedyatā bhāvadharmaḥ kintu layākalau | | manvāte neha vai kiñcittadapekṣā tvasau katham | śrūyatāṃ saṃvidaikātmyatattve'sminsaṃvyavasthite | | jaḍe'pi citirastyeva bhotsyamāne tu kā kathā | svabodhāvasare tāvadmotsyate layakevalī |	b-a Now the problem is how to accept the knowingness as an existential property when Pralayākala and Vijñānākala are entirely unaware of whatever is taking place outside themselves like the sleeping snake and the yogin in the state of samadhi respectively. b-a Now listen to what I am going to tell you regarding the oneness of consciousness in this state of things. When consciousness is implicit even in the inanimate, not to talk of those animate beings who lie on the verge of getting awakened.
dvividhiśca prabodho'sya mantratvāya bhavāya ca | bhāvanādibalādanyavaiṣṇavādinayoditāt | yathāsvamādharauttaryavicitrātsaṃskṛtastathā | līnaḥ vrabuddho mantratvaṃ tadīśatvamathaiti vā |	The awakened state of his inner being is of two kinds, namely, contemplative mantrātmaka and existential bhavāya. b-a Proceeding along the line of sādhanā as preached by Vaisnavas and allied systems, by virtue of their emotional and sentimental approach for self-elimination, aspirants may get awakened and attain the state of mantra and the Lord of mantras, short of autonomy, however.
svātantryavarjitā ye tu balānmohavaśīkṛtāḥ | layākalātsvasaṃskārātprabuddhyante bhavāya te |	certain state of being, however, they get degraded from their samskāra of the state of layākala to the worldly life itself.
jñānākalo'pi mantreśamaheśatvāya budhyate | mantrāditvāya vā jātu jātu saṃsṛtaye'pi vā |	-b- Even a jñānākala may get awakened into the state of Mantreśa and Mantreśvara sometimes and at others he may get degraded to be reborn.
| | avatāro hi vijñāniyogibhāve'sya bhidyate | uktaṃ ca bodhayāmāsa sa sisṛkṣurjagatprabhuḥ | | vijñānakevalānaṣṭāviti śrīpūrvaśāsane | ataḥ prabhotsyamānatve yānayorbodhayogyatā | tadbalādvedyatāyogyabhāvenaivātra vedyatā | tathā hi gāḍhanidre'pi priye'nāśaṅkitāgatām |	His rebirth, however, may also be of two elevated kinds as in the form of a man of special knowledge and in the capacity of a yogin. a In the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra, it has been stated by Lord Śiva that the Lord of Creation created eight vijñāna-kevalins, namely, Aghore, Paramāghore, Ghorerūpa, Ghoremukha, Bhima, Bhisana, Vamana and Pivana b-a Therefore, when the potentiality for knowledgeability gets awakened in them, it forms the basis of their special understanding.
māṃ drakṣyatīti nāṅgeṣu sveṣu mātyabhisārikā | evaṃ śivo'pi manute etasyaitatpravedyatām |	b-a This may be elucidated in the form of a young lady's dream that, though completely asleep, my lover would decidedly come, look at me and would be united with me and gets exhilarated beyond measure.
yāsyatīti sṛjāmīti tadānīṃ yogyataiva sā | vedyatā tasya bhāvasya bhoktṛtā tāvatī ca sā | layākalasya citro hi bhoga kena vikalpyate | yathā yathā hi saṃvittiḥ sa hi bhogaḥ sphuṭo'sphuṭaḥ | |	Siva also contemplates on the ground of this kind of potentiality in him that the potentiality concerned would be actualised in the form of experience of delight in the same measure as it lies in them. What form the experience would take is rather beyond the range of imagination. b-a As would be the quantum of awareness in the person concerned so would be the quantum of delight in its depth as well as clarity.
smṛtiyogyo'pyanyathā vā bhogyabhāvaṃ na tūjjhati | gāढ़nidrāvimūḍho'pi kāntāliṅgitavigrahaḥ | bhoktaiva bhaṇyate so'pi manute bhoktatāṃ purā| utprekṣāmātrahīno'pi kāṃcitkulavadhūṃ puraḥ |	Memorable or not, the experience would by no means be rid of joy. b-a A lover lying in deep sleep embracing his beloved feels himself as her enjoyer and so even after getting awakened. b-a Although shorn of imagination, a person comes to have a look at a beautiful lady of integrity and incidentally happens to think of her worthiness of being an object of his enjoyment. The very idea of his enjoying with her makes him immediately exhilarated.
saṃbhokṣyamāṇāṃ dṛṣṭveva rabhasād yāti saṃmadam | tāmeva dṛṣṭvā ca tadā samānāśayabhāgapi | anyastathā na saṃvitte kamatropalabhāmahe | loke rūḍhamidaṃ dṛṣṭirasminkāraṇamantarā | |	b-a Having seen the same lady at the same time, though equally capable of the same kind of experience in regard to that lady, there happens to be another person Tattvādhvan Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... who does not undergo the same experience of exhilaration. Which one of the two deserves our appreciation and which one our condemnation! b-a It is a matter of common acceptance that the outlook of the persons concerned plays the role of the determinant in such cases besides the sameness of the cause.
prasīdatīva magneva nirvātīvetivādini | itthaṃ vistaratastattvabhedo'yaṃ samudāhṛtaḥ |	This fact gets elucidated here by the differences in the responses of persons concerned. Placed under one and the same circumstance, while one feels rejoiced, the other immersed and the third remains absolutely unaffected.
śaktiśaktimatāṃ bhedādanyonyaṃ tatkṛteṣvapi | bhedeṣvanyonyato bhedāttathā tattvāntaraiḥ saha |	b-a Due to difference between force and the enforced from each other, there are other differences also created by them. Thus, there is no end to differences and sub-differences.
bhedopabhedagaṇanāṃ kurvato nāvadhiḥ kvacit | tata eva vicitro'yaṃ bhuvanādividhiḥ sthitaḥ | pārthivatve'pi no sāmyaṃ rudravaiṣṇavalokayoḥ| kā kathānyatra tu bhavet bhogo vāpi svarūpake |	In this endlessness of differences lies the peculiarity of creation, etc. - As regards physicality, there is no comparison between this world on the one side and the other world such as Visnu's and Rudra's on the other. In view of this, nothing needs to be uttered about other worlds in themselves as well as means of enjoyment available there.
sa ca no vistaraḥ sākṣācchakyo yadyapi bhāsitum | tathāpi mārgamātreṇa kathyamāno vivicyatām |	As such, although we are incapable of detailing out all the kinds and sub-kinds of the worlds in all their varieties, just think of whatever is being made out by way of exemplification.
saptānāṃ mātṛśaktīnāmanyo'nyaṃ bhedane sati | rūpamekānnapaścāśatsvarūpaṃ cādhikaṃ tataḥ |	On multiplication of seven kinds of the knower and the same number of their forces with each other, we get forty-nine varieties which can be extended still further.
sarva sarvātmakaṃ yasmāttattmātsakalamātari | layākalādiśaktīnāṃ saṃbhavo'styeva tattvataḥ | |	Since all is pervaded by all in our system, in the knower of the category of sakala, layākala, etc. all other categories are essentially possible.
sa tvasphuṭo'stu bhedāṃśaṃ dātuṃ tāvatprabhurbhavet | teṣāmapi ca bhedānāmanyonyaṃ bahubhedatā |	Let these differences remain ambiguous due to lack of clarity, yet obviously since the differentiator behind them is the Lord Himself, those differences get multiplied further via multiplication with each other.
mukhyānāṃ bhedabhedānāṃ jalādyairbhedane sati | mukhyabhedaprakāreṇa vidherānantyamuccate |	If the main number of varieties of entities emerging out of multiplication of the forces and the forceful mutually be multiplied further by that of water, etc., we cannot but reach endlessness eventually.
sakalasya samudbhūtāścakṣurādisvaśaktayaḥ | nyagbhūtāśca pratanvanti bhedāntaramapi sphuṭam | |	Even the forces working behind the operation of the senses like eyes, etc., if taken into account in their both manifest and unmanifest states in the individual Tattvādhvan Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... enveloped in the element of kalā, sakala, obviously extend the number of varieties further.
evaṃ layākalādīnāṃ tatsaṃskārapadoditāt | pāṭavātprakṣayādvāpi bhedāntaramudīryate |	In the same way are mentioned the varieties and sub-varieties of other kinds of subject, namely, layākala, etc. due to the presence of impressions created in them in their earlier states of being moreover in their active as well as attenuated forms.
nyakkṛtāṃ śaktimāsthāyāpyudāsīnatayā sthitim | anāviśyeva yadvetti tatrānyā vedyatā khalu |	Decidedly different is the nature of knowledge as is received in the state when the power of reception is lowered and hence indifferently lacking in momentum.
āviśyeva nimajyeva vikāsyeva vighūrṇya ca | vidato vedyatānyaiva bhedo'trārthakriyocitaḥ | anyaśaktitirobhāve kasyāścitsusphuṭodaye | bhedāntaramapi jñeyaṃ vīṇāvādakadṛṣṭivat | tirobhāvodbhavī śakteḥ svaśaktyantarato'nyataḥ | cetyamānādacetyādvā tanvāte bahubhedatām | |	The kind of knowledge received via these latter processes is of a different quality in its effect. - When a particular capability gets superseded by another one, it results in the emergence of another kind of knowledge as happens in the case of supervision of sight by audition in the player of vinā as he plays on the strings without looking at them. Disappearance and appearance of capabilities on account of replacement of one by the other or from within each other consciously or unconsciously extend the variety of differences.
evametaddharādīnāṃ tattvānāṃ yāvatī daśā | kācidasti ghaṭākhyāpi tatra saṃdarśitā bhiḥ | atrāpi vedyatā nāma tādātmyaṃ vedakaiḥ saha | tataḥ sakalavedyo'sau ghaṭaḥ sakala eva hi | |	Thus has been elucidated the difference of varieties in regard to elements like the earth, etc. including its state of being a pitcher, etc. In this regard also, there is an element of oneness of the object with the subject. Thus, a pitcher becoming an object of knowledge of an individual enwrapped in the element of kalā, itself gets enwrapped in that kalā.
yāvacchivaikavedyo'sau śiva evāvabhāsate | tāvadekaśarīro hi bodho bhātyeva yāvatā |	Insofar as an aspirant remains contemplating exclusively on Siva, he appears as Siva Himself Until the end of that contemplation, he shares oneness with Siva's body.
adhunātra samastasya dharātattvasya darśyate | sāmastya evābhihitaṃ pāścadaśyaṃ puroditam |	Now is being shown the integrality of the element of earth having explained the principle of the fifteen components.
dharātattvāvibhedena yaḥ prakāśaḥ prakāśate | sa eva śivanātho'tra pṛthivī brahma tanmatam |	The light which illumines in the form of the entire world is Lord Siva Himself and hence the earth also is Brahman according to this viewpoint.
dharātattvagatāḥ siddhīrvitarītuṃ yamudyatān | prerayanti śivecchāto ye te mantramaheśvarāḥ | | preryamāṇāstu mantreśā mantrāstadvācakāḥ sphuṭam | dharātattvagataṃ yogamabhyasya śivavidyayā |	Those are Mantreśvaras who as per the wish of Śiva offer siddhis to those who aspire for such siddhis which are related to the element of the earth. Those who are undergoing the process of stimulation are known as Mantreśa. Mantras serve as the content of their stimulation. Vijñānākalas are those who having practised yoga relating to the earth according to the provisions of Saivism are as yet to attain the state of eternal constancy.
na tu pāśavasāṃkhyīyavaiṣṇavādidvitādṛśā | aprāptadhruvadhāmāno vijñānākalatājuṣaḥ |	It is exclusive of those who have done so under the ambit of the dualistic disciplines such as Sānkhya and Vaisnavism.
tāvattattvopabhogena ye kalpānte layaṃ gatāḥ | sauṣuptāvasthayopetāste'tra pralayakevalāḥ |	- Pralaya-kevalas are those who have got dissolved while remaining as yet in the process of such practices and hence in the state of sound sleep as it were.
sauṣupte tattvalīnatvaṃ sphuṭameva hi lakṣyate | anyathā niyatasvapnasaṃdṛṣṭirjāyate kutaḥ | |	Absorption with the reality is an obvious precondition of reaching the state of sound sleep. Otherwise, the state of dream cannot arise.
sauṣuptamapi citraṃ ca svacchāsvacchādi bhāsate| asvāpsa sukhamityādismṛtivaicitryadarśanāt | yadaiva sa kṣaṇaṃ sūkṣmaṃ nidrāyaiva prabuddhyate | tadaiva smṛtireṣeti nārthajajñānajā smṛtiḥ | |	There are also different kinds of sound sleep, such as clean and unclean as is obvious from the expressions of people following their sound sleep, such as someone's observation “My sleep was pleasant” as distinct from someone else's “My sleep was unpleasant.” Such statements are not expressions of memory nor are even any kind of knowledge of any actual object as is obvious from their having been made immediately after getting awakened.
māyākarmasamullāsasaṃmiśritamalāvilāḥ | dharādhirohiṇo jñeyāḥ sakalā iha pudgalāḥ |	Those whose inner being is engrossed in the manifestation of maladies born of actions of māyā, attachment with worldly things, and are confined in their birth and rebirth to the earth alone are sakala called also as pudgala.
asyaiva saptakasya svasvavyāpāraprakalpane | prakṣobho yastadevoktaṃ śaktīnāṃ saptakaṃ sphuṭam |	Sevenfoldness of the forces lies in the application of the forces of them in their respective functions which arouse agitation in them.
śivo hyacyutacidrūpastisrastacchaktayastu yāḥ | tāḥ svātantryavaśopāttagrahītrākāratāvaśāt | tridhā mantrāvasānāḥ syurudāsīnā iva sthitāḥ | grāhyākāroparāgāttu grahītrākāratāvaśāt |	Śiva is of the nature of eternal consciousness and is imbued with three kinds of forces which are desire, knowledge and action. They assume the form of the receptor out of their autonomous nature and hence get consolidated in the forms of Mantra, Mantreśvara and Mantramaheśvara and while remaining in themselves they lie quite indifferently. However as a result of the effect of attainment of them, they assume the form of receptors and begin to play the roles of Mantra, etc.
sakalāntāstu tāstisra icchājñānakriyā matāḥ | saptadhetthaṃ pramātṛtvaṃ tatkṣobho mānatā tathā |	-a Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... Thus, the role of the knower is of seven kinds. With the play of these roles, the standard of knowingness also pramānatā gets divided into as many kinds.
yattu grahītṛtārūpasaṃvitsaṃsparśavarjitam| śuddhaṃ jaḍaṃ tatsvarūpamitthaṃ viśvaṃ trikātmakam |	Out of these kinds, which aspect of it becomes bereft of the nature of the receptor, gets degraded to the status of the individual. This is the way of the formation of the triad of paśu, pāśa and paśupati, that is, the individual, the force and Siva as the Lord of the force.
evaṃ jalādyapi vadedbhedairbhinnaṃ mahāmatiḥ | anayā tu diśā prāyaḥ sarvabhedeṣu vidyate | |	b- The wise man needs to talk of diversification of this kind in regard to water, etc. also. This mode of diversification would normally be applicable to all cases.
etacca sūtritaṃ dhātrā śrīpūrve yadbravīti hi | savyāpārādhipatvenetyādinā jāgradāditām | abhinne'pi śive'ntaḥsthasūkṣmabodhānusārataḥ | adhunā prāṇaśaktisthe tattvajāle vivicyate | |	This has been indicated in a summary form in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra when He observes that though He remains the undivided same everywhere, functionally He undergoes the states of wakefulness, etc. as also those of forms of gross, subtle, etc. in keeping with the awareness of the aspirant. -a Now is going to be discussed the group of elements involved in prāna.
bhedo'yaṃ pāñcadaśyādiryathā śrīśaṃbhurādiśat | samaste'rthe'tra nirgrāhye tuṭayaḥ ṣoḍaśa kṣaṇā | ṣaṭtriṃśāṅgule cāre sāṃśadvyaṅgulakalpitāḥ | tatrādyaḥ paramādvaito nirvibhāgarasātmakaḥ | |	Here also divisions are the same fifteen as imparted by Sambhu. b-a All objects of knowledge here in this world involve sixteen moments ksana each one from amongst them extends for two and one-fourth finger-ends covering thus as a whole the length of thirty-six finger-ends. b-a Out of these sixteen moments, the initial one is supremely non-dual, indivisible and abounds in the sense of exhilaration rasātmaka while the second one is experienced as the point of emergence of the receptor.
dvitīyo grāhakollāsarūpaḥ prativibhāvyate | antyastu grāhyatādātmyātsvarūpībhāvamāgataḥ | |	The last, on the other hand, becomes one with the object of knowledge and thus represents the state of restoration to one's own real being which is indistinguishable from its immediately preceding one which has become identified with the object of knowledge.
pravibhāvyo na hi pṛthagupāntyo grāhaka kṣaṇaḥ | tṛtīyaṃ kṣaṇamārabhya kṣaṇaṣaṭkaṃ tu yatsthitam |	b-a The group of six moments from the third onwards is optionless nirvikalpa moving towards options and hence is of the nature of coverture.
tannirvikalpaṃ prodgacchadvikalpācchādanātmakam | tadeva śivarūpaṃ hi paraśaktyātmakaṃ viduḥ | | |	It is understood essentially as of the form of Śiva and hence as one with the supernal force.
dvitīyaṃ madhyamaṃ ṣaṭkaṃ parāparapadātmakam | vikalparūḍhirapyeṣā kramātprasphuṭatāṃ gatā |	b- The second one is the intermediate group of six moments, a mixed state of the higher and the lower with the state of option getting manifest gradually. Tattvādhvan Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
ṣaṭke'va prathame devyastisraḥ pronmeṣavṛttitām | nimeṣavṛttitāṃ cāśu spṛśantyaḥ ṣaṭkatāṃ gatāḥ |	In the first group of six moments the three forces will, knowledge and action when take a quick shift from the state of predominance of force to that of predominance of the forceful, they become six.
evaṃ dvitīyaṣaṭke'pi kiṃ tvatra grāhyavartmanā | uparāgapadaṃ prāpya parāparatayā sthitāḥ |	In the case of second group of six moments also the same sort of change occurs though via the path of receptivity. Having become affected by attachment, the forces remain here mixed up with the higher and the lower.
ādye'tra ṣaṭke tā devyaḥ svātantryollāsamātrataḥ | jighṛkṣite'pyupādhau syuḥ pararūpādavicyutāḥ |	Though the forces of willing, etc. enjoying the ascendancy of autonomy in the first six moments get narrowed down in the second six ones, yet they remain imbued with the supernal form of the Being here as well.
asti cātiśayaḥ kaścittāsāmapyuttarottaram| yo vivekadhanairdhīraiḥ sphuṭīkṛtyāpi darśyate |	This process of preservation of the former step along with the development of the novel one goes on taking place gradually which is also demonstrated by people discrete and enlightened.
kecittvekāṃ tuṭiṃ grāhye caikāmapi grahītari | tādātmyena vinikṣipya saptakaṃ saptakaṃ viduḥ |	There are some who make this division differently by adding one moment to each one of these groups oriented to the object and subject of reception and raising the number of moments in each one of them to seven.
tadasyāṃ sūkṣmasaṃvittau kalanāya samudyatāḥ | saṃvedayante yadrūpaṃ tatraṃ kiṃ vāgvikatthanaiḥ |	This is a matter of subtle experience in which only those need to be regarded as authoritative who are actively involved in the attainment of practical experience and intellectual calculation of the steps crossed. Any discourse in this regard is, therefore, useless.
evaṃ dharādimūlāntaṃ prakriyā prāṇagāminī | guruparvakramātproktā bhede pañcadaśātmake |	What has been made out here is strictly in keeping with the tradition of the teacher and the taught as well as the sacred texts concerned as also within the confines of the established number fifteen in this regard.
tasyāṃ hrāso vikalpasya sphuṭatā cāvikalpinaḥ | |	It results in decrease of options and clarity in the state of optionlessness.
yathā hi ciraduḥkhārtaḥ paścādāttasukhasthitiḥ | vismaratyeva taduḥkhaṃ sukhaviśrāntivartmanā |	These decrease and increase take place in the same way as it happens in the case of a sufferer from pain moving towards the state of joy gradually and comes to even forget his state of pain.
tathā gatavikalpe'pi rūḍhāḥ saṃvedane janāḥ | vikalpaviśrāntibalāttāṃ sattāṃ nābhimanvate |	In the same way, with the elimination of the state of option, the awareness concerned with the options also gets attenuated on account of the force of the state of optionlessness.
vikalpanirhāsavaśena yāti vikalpavandhyā paramārthasatyā | saṃvitsvarūpaprakaṭatvamitthaṃ tatrāvadhāne yatatāṃ subuddhiḥ |	Tattvādhvan Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... On account of decrease in the options, the ultimate truth also becomes bereft of options with the consequent revelation of the consciousness in its true form.
grāhyagrāhakasaṃvittau saṃbandhe sāvadhānatā | iyaṃ sā tatra tatroktā sarvakāmadudhā yataḥ |	Understanding the nature of consciousness which interconnects the object and the subject and being attentive to its intensification via sādhanā which has been talked about here are capable of fulfilling all aspirations of the aspirant.
evaṃ dvayaṃ dvayaṃ yāvannyūnībhavati bhedagam | tāvattuṭidvayaṃ yāti nyūnatāṃ kramaśaḥ sphuṭam | ata eva śivāveśe dvituṭi parigīyate | ekā tu sā tuṭistatra pūrṇā śuddhaiva kevalam |	In this way, via the process of elimination of moments in twins at one instance which create the difference between the individual and the Supreme Being, the aspirant at last comes to elimination of all but two representing Siva and Sakti. Thus, at the stage of prevalence of Śiva Śivāveśa, only a couple of moments remain there one of which is absolutely pure and perfect while the other represents Siva and Sakti together embodying all knowledge and action.
dvitīyā śiva śakti rūpaiva sarvajñānakriyātmikā | tasyāmavahito yogī ki na vetti karoti vā |	- a The yogin who has immersed himself in the practice of elimination of the breath- moments can know as well as accomplish anything.
tathā coktaṃ kallaṭena śrīmatā tuṭipātagaḥ | lābhaḥ sarvajñakartṛtve tuṭe pāto'parā tuṭi |	This has been stated by respectable Kallata also when he observes that elimination of breath-moments results in the awareness and power of accomplishment of all whatsoever and that elimination of the earlier leads to the emergence of the later.
ādyāyāṃ tu tuṭau sarva sarvataḥ pūrṇamekatām | gataṃ ki tatra vedyaṃ vā kāryaṃ vā vyapadeśabhāk |	b- In the initial breath-moment lies all-round perfection unified into one leaving nothing else to be known or accomplished and rendering both knowing and doing absolutely contentless.
ato bhedasamullāsakalāṃ prāthamikīṃ budhāḥ | cinvanti pratibhāṃ devīṃ sarvajñatvādisiddhaye |	Therefore, wise people prefer this initial breath-moment, bear as does all potentiality of manifestation in it, for the sake of siddhis of all kinds including omniscience.
saiva śakti śivasyoktā tṛtīyādituṭiṣvatha | mantrādhināthatacchaktimantreśādyāḥ kramoditāḥ |	The same force of Siva is said to manifest itself on concentration on the third, etc. breath-moments resulting in elevation of the aspirant to the status of Mantra, Mantreśa, Mantra Maheśvara, etc.
tāsu saṃdadhataścittamavadhānaikadharmakam | tattatsiddhasamāveśaḥ svayamevopajāyate | |	By virtue of exclusive concentration on these points one after another prevalence of the related siddhis comes into effect automatically.
ata eva yathā bhedabahutvaṃ dūratā tathā saṃvittau tuṭibāhulyādakṣārthāsaṃnikarṣavat | yathā yathā hi nyūnatvaṃ tuṭīnāṃ hrāsato bhidaḥ | tathā tathātinaikaṭyaṃ saṃvidaḥ syācchivāvadhi |	Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... As the factor of distance between the eye and its object creates obstruction in perception in the form of fadedness of the vision, even so happens in the consciousness due to obstruction of the multiplicity of breath-moments. As the difference between Śiva and the consciousness of the aspirant decreases with the lessening of the number of intervening breath-moments, even so grows closeness between Him and the consciousness of the aspirant.
śivatattvamataḥ proktamantikaṃ sarvato'mutaḥ | ata eva prayatno'yaṃ tatpraveśe na vidyate | | yathā yathā hi dūratvaṃ yatnayogastathā tathā | bhāvanākaraṇādīnāṃ śive niravakāśatām |	This is why Siva is said essentially to obtain everywhere and available to His aspirant anywhere. -a Herein lies the truth of the statement that there is no necessity of any effort to get entry into the consciousness of Śiva but for the elimination of the distance since as would be an increase in the distance, so would grow the necessity of the effort. b- This is why those Saivites who have delved deep into the mystery of the School maintain the futility of any emotional ideation, etc.
ata eva hi manyante saṃpradāyadhanā janāḥ | tathā hi dṛśyatāṃ loko ghaṭādeveṃdane yathā |	b-a This is quite obvious practically from what happens in the world. One has to put in some effort in being aware of the jar, etc.
prayatnavānivābhāti tathā kiṃ sukhavedane | āntaratvamidaṃ prāhuḥ saṃvinnaikaṭyaśālitām tāṃ ca cidrūpatonmeṣaṃ bāhyatvaṃ tannimeṣatām | | |	and by no means in experiencing the state of joy. b-a Closeness to consciousness is termed as internal in which case consciousness gets revealed while externality lies in getting away from it.
bhavināṃ tvantiko'pyevaṃ na bhātītyatidūratā |	b-a What happens in the world, though close to ourselves, does not appear as such but rather as extremely distant to us.
dūre'pi hyantikībhūte bhānaṃ syāttvatra tatkatham | na ca bījāṅkuralatādalapuṣpaphalādivat | |	Thus, what is close to us, if not experienced as such, how can we know it intimately ? b-a There is no involvement of graduality in regard to consciousness as it happens in the case of the seed, sprout, creeper, leaf, flower and fruit, etc.
kramikeyaṃ bhavetsaṃvitsūtastatra kilāṅkuraḥ | bījāllatā tvaṅkurānno bījādiha tu sarvataḥ |	In the case of the seed, etc. there is graduality in the manifestation of one from the other inasmuch as it is from the seed that grows the sprout and from the sprout the creeper, etc.
saṃvittattvaṃ bhāsamānaṃ paripūrṇa hi sarvataḥ | sarvasya kāraṇaṃ proktaṃ sarvatraivoditaṃ yataḥ |	Rather it is usual to say that all have grown out of the seed. So is the case with consciousness giving birth to all out of its all-round perfection. It is said to be the cause of all on account of its all-pervasiveness.
tata eva ghaṭe'pyeṣā prāṇavṛttiryadi sphuret | viśrāmyeccāśu tatraiva śivabīje layaṃ vrajet |	b- Now if the process of breathing were to start even in this jar, it would not but find full relief only in merger in Siva as its seed.
na tu kramikatā kācicchivātmatve kadācana | anyanmantrādhi nāthādi kāraṇaṃ tattu saṃnidheḥ | śivābhedāccā kiṃ cātha dvaite naikaṭyavedanāt | anayā ca diśā sarvaṃ sarvadā pravivecayan | |	There is no place for any kind of graduality in getting one with Śiva. Whatever graduality appears to obtain among the states of Mantra and Mantreśvara, etc., that all is due to the relativity of closeness with respect to oneness with Him in the case of non-dualism and closeness in the case of duality.
bhairavāyata eva drāk ciccakreśvaratāṃ gataḥ | sa itthaṃ prāṇago bhedaḥ khecarīcakragopitaḥ | mayā prakaṭitaḥ śrīmacchāmbhavājñānuvartinā| atraivādhvani vedyatvaṃ prāpte yā saṃvidudbhavet |	-a Contemplating always on this pattern that all is a manifestation of Bhairava Himself, the aspirant takes no time in attaining the state of oneness with Him preceded by the sense of Lordship over the entire spectrum of consciousness. b-a The kinds of breath that have been revealed by me here are guarded in their secrecy by the presiding deities of Khecari and hence their revelation has been made in compliance of the permission of Sambhu.
tasyāḥ svakaṃ yaddhaicitryaṃ tadavasthāpadābhidham | jāgratsvapnaḥ suṣuptaṃ ca turyaṃ ca tadatītakam | iti pañca padānyāhurekasminvedake sati | tatra yaiṣā dharātattvācchivāntā tattvapaddhatiḥ |	b-a Peculiar is the nature of the consciousness which emerges via progression on this line of spiritual practice and is denominated in keeping with the particular state in which it is availed of. b-a Wakefulness, dream, sound sleep, the fourth and the transcendent are the names of the steps taken by one and the same practitioner.
tasyāmeka pramātā cedavaśyaṃ jāgratādikam | taddarśyate śambhunāthaprasādādviditaṃ mayā |	b-a Within this framework of the reality beginning with the earth and ending with Siva, if the knower is one and the same, he has necessarily to pass along all these states which have been brought to my awareness by Sambhunātha.
yadadhiṣṭheyameveha nādhiṣṭhātṛ kadācana | saṃvedanagataṃ vedyaṃ tajjāgratsamudāhṛtam |	b- The locus of establishment can never be establisher himself. What comes to us as the object of our sensibility is known as the jāgrat, awakened.
caitramaitrādibhūtāni tattvāni ca dharāditaḥ | abhidhākaraṇībhūtāḥ śabdāḥ kiṃ cābhidhā pramā |	Beings named as Caitra, Maitra, etc. essences such as earth, etc., denominational words and the reality which they stand for, knowledge knower, object of knowledge and the consciousness itself, all these are the locus of establishment and have been termed as the awakened.
tathā hi bhāsate yattannīlamantaḥ pravedane | saṃkalparūpe bāhyasya tadadhiṣṭhātṛ bodhakam |	- For example, establisher is one who appears as Nila from within outside in the form of the resolve as such.
yattu bāhyatayā nīlaṃ cakāstyasya na vidyate | kathaṃcidapyadhiṣṭhātṛbhāvastajjāgraducyate |	As against him, what appears as Nila only outwardly can by no means attain the status of the establisher. - Tattvädhvan- Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
tatra caitre bhāsamāne yo dehāṃśaḥ sa kathyate | abuddho yastu mānāṃśaḥ sa buddho mitikārakaḥ | prabṛddhaḥ suprabuddhaśca pramāmātreti ca kramaḥ | cāturvidhyaṃ hi piṇḍasthanāmni jāgrati kīrtitam |	In Caitra, as he appears, the bodily aspect of his being is known as abuddha, unawakened while what serves as the standard of knowledge in him that is his prāņa and consciousness, is known as awakened buddha and prabuddha and the element of pure knowledge in him is known as suprabuddha, fully awakened. These are the four stages discerned under the awakened category known as pindastha, bodily.
jāgradādi catuṣkaṃ hi pratyekamiha vidyate | jāgrajjāgradabuddhaṃ tajjāgratsvapnastu buddhatā |	- Out of the four states of consciousness, namely, awakened, dream, sound sleep and the fourth, each one of them is again specified by its four sub-states of each interpenetrating the other.
ityādi turyātītaṃ tu sarvagatvātpṛthakkutaḥ | uktaṃ ca piṇḍagaṃ jāgradabuddhaṃ buddhameva ca | prabuddhaṃ suprabuddhaṃ ca caturvidhamidaṃ smṛtam | meyabhūmiriyaṃ mukhyā jāgradākhyānyadantarā |	The fifth state of the transcendent, turyātita, however, has been kept apart from them on account of its pervasion of all of them, but why? -a It has already been stated that the bodily aspect of the being has four states involved in it, namely, awakened, ignorant, knowledgeable and more knowledgeable and supremely knowledgeable. The awakened state is the main and the locus of understanding those other than this being variations on it.
bhūtatattvābhidhānānāṃ yoṃ'śo'dhiṣṭheya ucyate | piṇḍasthamiti taṃ prāhuriti śrīmālinīmate | laukikī jāgradityeṣā saṃjñā piṇḍasthamityapi| yogināṃ yogasiddhyartha saṃjñeyaṃ paribhāṣyate |	b- Śrī Tantrāloka That part of entities known as bhūtattva, constituent elements of the being, which serves as the burden of the locus, has been called pindastha, located in the body with the sense of one's identity with it as stated by the Mālinivijayottara Tantra. What is popularly known as awakened is called in yogic terms as pindastha.
adhiṣṭheyasamāpattimadhyāsīnasya yoginaḥ | tādātmyaṃ kila piṇḍasthaṃ mitaṃ piṇḍaṃ hi piṇḍitam |	This name has been accorded to this state of consciousness for the sake of yogin's control over it. The yogin practising oneness with what he is standing on is known as pindastha as limited form of matter is what is called as pinda.
prasaṃkhyānaikarūḍhānāṃ jñānināṃ tu taducyate | sarvatobhadramāpūrṇaṃ sarvato vedyasattayā |	Those yogins are called all-round auspicious, sarvtobhadra, who have access to the centre of all kinds of knowledge and hence everything has become their object of understanding.
sarvasattāsamāpūrṇa viśvaṃ paśyedyato yataḥ | jñānī tatastataḥ saṃvittattvamasya prakāśate | |	As the wise yogin moves onwards in his understanding of the entire world as pervaded by an all-inclusive being, the illumination of his consciousness goes on expanding.
lokayogaprasaṃkhyānatrairūpyavaśataḥ kila | nāmāni trīṇi bhaṇyante svapnādiṣvapyayaṃ vidhiḥ | |	In talking about the states in regard to dream, etc., three ways of denomination are used, namely, popular use, yoga and knowledge.
yattvadhiṣṭhānakaraṇabhāvamadhyāsya vartate | vedyaṃ satpūrvakathitaṃ bhūtatattvābhidhāmayam |	The state of dream has its base in the state of wakefulness. It comes in the category of the known. It also refers to the happening of the past.
tatsvapno mukhyato jñeyaṃ tacca vaikalpike pathi	It is knowable by taking to the path of options.
lokarūḍho'pyasau svapnaḥ sāmyaṃ cābāhyarūpatā | utprekṣāsvapnasaṃkalpasmṛtyunmādādidṛṣṭiṣu | vispaṣṭaṃ yadvedyajātaṃ jāgranmukhyatayaiva tat |	-a In the state of wakeful sleep the aspirant looks towards the world with the same eye as the ordinary human looks towards his dreamy figures in that state. b-a The state of wakefulness of the common man is like one observing the world in the state of immersion is pure imagination, dream, ideation, memory, madness, etc.
yattu tatrāpyavispaṣṭaṃ spaṣṭādhiṣṭhātṛ bhāsate | | vikalpāntaragaṃ vedyaṃ tatsvapnapadamucyate| tadaiva tasya vettyeva svayameva hyabāhyatām |	b-a That is the core of the state of dream in which what is extremely ambiguous in actuality appears as doubtlessly clear. Then and here the subject becomes sure of its pure subjectivity.
pramātrantarasādhārabhāvahānyasthirātmate | tatrāpi cāturvidhyaṃ tat prāgdiśaiva prakalpayet |	b- There, too, needs to be conceived the prevalence of the principle of four- foldness as was applied in earlier cases.
gatāgataṃ suvikṣiptaṃ saṃgataṃ susamāhitam | atrāpi pūrvavannāma laukikaṃ svapna ityadaḥ |	These are the features of going and coming gatāgata extreme diversion, suitability and getting fully established. -a Here also svapna, dream, conveys the same meaning which it does in the popoular use.
bāhyābhimatabhāvānāṃ svāpo hyagrahaṇaṃ matam | sarvādhvanaḥ padaṃ prāṇaḥ saṃkalpo'vagamātmakaḥ |	It means immunity from receptivity to external stimuli and objects. Pada means confluence of prāna and determination. While prāņa is the starting point of all the pathways to spiritual pursuit, determination is the stimulant of it.
padaṃ ca tatsamāpatti padasthaṃ yogino viduḥ | vedyasattāṃ bahirbhūtāmanapekṣyaiva sarvataḥ |	This is known to yogins as such. b-a It is imperative for aspirants to overlook all whatever is available from outside and freely concentrate on whatever emerges from within.
vedye svātantryabhāg jñānaṃ svapnaṃ vyāptitayā bhajet | mānabhūmiriyaṃ mukhyā svapnoṃ hyāmarśanātmakaḥ | vedyacchāyo'vabhāso hi meye'dhiṣṭhānamucyate | yattvadhiṣṭhātṛtāde pūrvoktasya vapurdhruvam |	This is the main locus of understanding while the state of dream is contemplation on that understanding. b- The shadow of the Ultimate Reality which is the supreme object of our Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... understanding is the axis of our knowledge in the form of prāna, determination, etc.. Therefore, it is considered as the stable body of it which, indeed, is the seed of the creation lying silent in our inmost being and hence is called as the state of sound sleep.
bījaṃ viśvasya tattūṣṇobhūtaṃ sauṣūptamucyate | anubhūtau vikalpe ca yo'sau draṣṭā sa eva hi |	He acts as the seer in both the states of wakefulness and dream.
na bhāvagrahaṇaṃ tena suṣṭhu suptatvamucyate | tatsāmyāllaukikīṃ nidrāṃ suṣuptaṃ manvate budhāḥ |	Since He keeps Himself immune to receptivity of objects, He is regarded as lying in sound sleep. -a It is on the analogy of the sound sleep of that Supreme Being that wise people have called the corresponding state on the individual scale as sound sleep.
bījabhāvo'thāgrahaṇaṃ sāmyaṃ tūṣṇīṃsvabhāvatā | mukhyā mātṛdaśā seyaṃ suṣuptākhyā nigadyate |	On account of being the state of sound sleep, it is immune to receptivity of the objective world. Its equanimity is its silence. This state of being of the Knower is characterised as that of sound sleep.
rūpakatvācca rūpaṃ tattādātmyaṃ yoginaḥ punaḥ | rūpasthaṃ tatsamāpattyaudāsīnyaṃ rūpiṇāṃ viduḥ |	b- Form is termed as rūpa, because it makes the object visible. Rūpastha is that yogin who has established his oneness with that visible form. As a result of his self-identification with that form, there arises indifference towards that form in his mind.
udāsīnasya tasyāpi vedyaṃ yena caturvidham | bhūtādi tadupādhyutthamatra bhedacatuṣṭayam | | uditaṃ vipulaṃ śāntaṃ suprasannamathāparam | yattu pramātmakaṃ rūpaṃ pramāturupari sthitam | pūrṇatāgamanaunmukhyamaudāsīnyātparicyutiḥ | tatturyamucyate śaktisamāveśo hyasau mataḥ |	Due to assimilation of the object with the self, there occurs contraction in the object resulting in the loss of its universality - In the state of indifference towards the object, their root forms remain intact along with roots of their adjuncts in four forms, udita, stimulated, vipula, manifest, śānta, quiet and suprasanna, fulfilled. -a As regards the position of the content of knowledge over and above the knower, due to progression towards the state of fulfilment and hence departure from the state of indifference, there comes in the state known as the turiya, fourth, as also Sakti-samāveśa, the state of absorption in Sakti b- That consciousness is self-luminous.
sā saṃvitsvaprakāśā tu kaiściduktā prameyataḥ | mānānmātuśca bhinnaiva tadarthaṃ tritayaṃ yataḥ |	By some yogins it is said to be entirely independent of the object, subject and standard of knowledge. Consequently, it involves three stages in it.
meyaṃ māne mātari tat so'pi tasyāṃ mitau sphuṭam | viśrāmyatīti saivaiṣā devī viśvaikajīvitam |	This consciousness is the Supernal Brilliance enlivening the totality of the spectrum of Being.
rūpaṃ dṛśāhamityaṃśatrayamuttīrya vartate | dvāramātrāśritopāyā paśyāmītyanupāyikā | |	Pramā, knowledge, is ultimately the consciousness transcendent to the object subject and standard knowledge. All these three factors are only the door leading to it and hence dependent on it.
pramātṛtā svatantratvarūpā seyaṃ prakāśate | saṃvitturīyarūpaivaṃ prakāśātmā svayaṃ ca sā |	As such, I look at it as pathless in itself. It is self-luminous absolutely independent of its awareness involving the knower, the object of knowledge as well as the standard of it .
tatsamāveśatādātmye mātṛtvaṃ bhavati sphuṭam | tatsamāveśoparāgānmānatvaṃ meyatā punaḥ | tatsamāveśanaikaṭyāttrayaṃ tattadanugrahāt | vedyādibhedagalanāduktā seyamanāmayā |	In view of all these attributes this consciousness is the fourth. - Tattvādhvan- Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path... On actualisation of one's self-identity with that Consciousness arises the knowership, on ingression into it the objectivity and on ingressive closeness with it the standard of knowledge, all these three process being the fruits of Its grace.
aparaṃ parāparaṃ ca dvidhā tatsā parā tviyam | rūpakatvādudāsīnāccyuteyaṃ pūrṇatonmukhī | |	-a There are two stages in the fourth state of consciousness, namely, anāmayā blemishless and savyāpārā active.
prasaṃkhyātā pracayatasteneyaṃ pracayo matā| naitasyāmaparā turyadaśā saṃbhāvyate kila | saṃvinna kila vedyā sā vittvenaiva hi bhāsate| jāgradādyāstu saṃbhāvyāstisro'syāḥ prāgdaśā yataḥ |	The state of elimination of the distinction of the knower, known and knowing is called blemishless, while reception of grace in the same capacities is known as active. b-a The states of wakefulness, dream and sound sleep also are determined in view of the quantum of play of the force of the Lord in them. While the states of wakefulness and dream are characterised as the lower, and that of sound sleep is regarded as the higher the fourth is considered as the transcendent.
tritayānugrahātseyaṃ tenoktā trikaśāsane | manonmanamanantaṃ ca sarvārthamiti bhedataḥ |	The force operating behind these preceding states is known in the Trika śāstra respectively as manonmana nullification of manas, ananta infinite and sarvārtha inclusive of all.
yattu pūrṇānavacchinnavapurānandanirbharam | suryātītaṃ tu tatprāhustadeva paramaṃ padam |	b- The state of consciousness transcendent to the fourth is that of perfection, limitlessness and unmixed delight. It is also known as the Supreme State parama pada.
nātra yogasya sadbhāvo bhāvanāderabhāvataḥ | aprameye'paricchinne svatantre bhāvyatā kutaḥ | yogādyabhāvatastena nāmāsminnādiśadvibhuḥ | prasaṃkhyānabalāttvetadrūpaṃ pūrṇatvayogataḥ |	This state is inaccessible to yoga as it lies beyond the reach of contemplation, bhāvanā. How can there be any possibility of contemplation which is limitless and unknowable? Due to its inaccessibility to any device such as yoga, the Lord has left it unnamed. -a Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
anuttarādiha proktaṃ mahāpracayasaṃjñitam | pūrṇatvādeva bhedānāmasyāṃ saṃbhāvanā na hi |	Owing to its nature of pure consciousness as also perfection and ultimacy, this state is known as mahā-pracaya, largest collectivity. b-a Owing to its perfectness, there is no scope for any kind of distinction in it.
tannirāsāya naitasyāṃ bheda ukto viśeṣaṇam | satatoditamityetatsarvavyāpitvasūcakam | |	It is for the sake of elimination of any such possibility that it has been left unspecified. b-a Characterisation of it as constantly manifest, is indicative of its omnipresence, as what is one can never and by no means be differentiated from itself.
na hyeka eva bhavati bheda kvacana kaścana | turyātīte bheda eka satatodita ityayam | |	As such, there is no possibility of distinction in this state.
mūḍhavādastena siddhamavibheditvamasya tu | śrīpūrvaśāstre tenottaṃ padasthamaparaṃ viduḥ |	b-a Therefore, in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra it is stated that the state of padastha is lower to the Supernal .
mantrāstatpatayaḥ seśā rūpasthamiti kīrtyate | rūpātītaṃ parā śakti savyāpārāpyanāmayā | |	The Supernal Force is transcendent to form and notwithstanding its participation in action, it is blemishless.
niṣprapañco nirābhāsaḥ śuddhaḥ svātmanyavasthitaḥ | sarvātītaḥ śivo jñeyo yaṃ viditvā vimucyate | iti śrīsumatiprajñācandrikāśāntatāmasaḥ | śrīśambhunāthaḥ sadbhāvaṃ jāgradādau nyarūpayat |	b- Transcendent to the entire five-foldness and as sheer brilliance of illumination lying in the inmost being of oneself is Siva through the knowledge of whom the aspirant gets redeemed. This is what my revered teacher Śrīśambhunātha has revealed to me in this sublime form whose darkness of ignorance had already been removed by the moonlight like spiritual illumination of Śrisumatinātha.
anye tu kathayantyeṣāṃ bhaṅgīmanyādṛśīṃ śritāḥ | yadrūpaṃ jāgradādīnāṃ tadidānīṃ nirūpyate | |	Now hence onwards is going to be elaborated upon what others, such as the author of Isvara Pratyabhijñā have explained the spectrum of the states of wakefulness, etc.
tatrākṣavṛttimāśritya bāhyākāragraho hi yaḥ | tajjāgratsphuṭamāsīnamanubandhi punaḥ punaḥ |	Waking is the state of consciousness in which the external form is received by means of the senses in its vividness again and again which lies there in all its continuity.
ātmasaṃkalpanirmāṇaṃ svapno jāgradviparyayaḥ | layākalasya bhogo'sau malakarmavaśānna tu | |	The state of dream is the form opposite to the state of wakefulness as it is the creation of self-resolution. It is the object of sufferance of only those who are known as layākala as they are shrouded by the āņava and kārma malice.
sthirībhavenniśābhāvātsuptaṃ saukhyādyavedane | jñānākalasya malataḥ kevalādbhogamātrataḥ | |	As sound sleep is the state of complete ignorance and hence incapable of variation in sufferance in the form of pleasure and pain, in it what is experienced is just the joy of being. It is the state of jñānākala, immersed in sheer knowledge of being.
bhedavantaḥ svato'bhinnāścikīrṣyante jaḍājaḍāḥ | turye tatra sthitā mantratannāthādhīśvarāstrayaḥ |	As distinct from it is the fourth state of consciousness in which Mantra, Mantreśvara an Mantramaheśvara all the three states of being come to the fore.
yāvabhairavabodhāntaḥ praveśanasahiṣṇavaḥ | bhāvā vigaladātmīyasārāḥ svayamabhedinaḥ |	All the ideations along with their corresponding realities endure their being more or less until entrance into the awareness of the being of Bhairava. On the entry into that being, however, they dissolve their individualities and become indistinguishable from one another.
turyātītapade saṃsyuriti pañcadaśātmake | yasya yadyatsphuṭaṃ rūpaṃ tajjāgraditi manyatām | yadevāsthiramābhāti sa pūrvaṃ svapna īdṛśa | asphuṭaṃ tu yadābhāti suptaṃ tattatpuro'pi yat | | trayasyāsyānusaṃdhistu yadvaśādupajāyate | sraksūtrakalpaṃ tatturyaṃ sarvabhedeṣu gṛhyatām |	That state of transcendence of the fourth, along with all its fifteen-foldness gets reconciled into the oneness of Śiva and Śakti. -a In this whole spectrum of the reality covered by the foregoing analysis, whatever form is vivid needs to be taken as the state of wakefulness, whatever is unstable is to be taken as the state of dream, and whatever is ambiguous is to be regarded as to belong to the state of sound sleep. As distinct from these three states, whatever appears as the interlink of these three states needs to be regarded as the fourth state like the sumeru of a rosary.
yattvadvaitabharollāsadrāvitāśeṣabhedakam | turyātītaṃ tu tatprāhuritthaṃ sarvatra yojayeta | layakāle tu svaṃ rūpaṃ jāgrattatpūrvavṛtti tu | svapnādīti kramaṃ sarvaṃ sarvatrānusaredbudhaḥ |	b- As distinct from all these that state needs to be considered as the transcendent which has got rid of the entire division and distinction by means of arousal of the sense of non-dualism. This mode of association needs to be followed everywhere in this regard. It is imperative for the wise man to apply this mode of approach on the occasion of dissolution in regard to the state of wakefulness, dream, etc.
ekatrāpi prabhau pūrṇe citturyātītamucyate | ānandasturyamicchaiva bījabhūmiḥ suṣuptatā | | jñānaśaktiḥ svapna uktaḥ kriyāśaktistu jāgṛtiḥ | na caivamupacāraḥ syātsarvaṃ tatraiva vastutaḥ |	everywhere. Together in the Lord Himself who is by all means perfect; His conciousness stands for the transcendent state, delight for the fourth, wish for the sound sleep on account of playing the role of the ground where seed is sown, His power of knowing stands for the state of dream while the power of action for the state of wakefulness.
na cenna kvāpi mukhyatvaṃ nopacāro'pi tatkvacit | etacchrīpūrvaśāstre ca sphuṭamuktaṃ maheśinā | |	This has clearly been stated by Lord Maheśa Himself in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra.
tatra svarūpaṃ śaktiśca sakalaśceti tattrayam | iti jāgradavastheyaṃ bhede pañcadaśātmake | | akalau svapnasauṣupte turya mantrādivargabhāk | turyātītaṃ śaktiśambhū trayodaśābhidhe punaḥ |	According to it, Siva, Sakti and the individual enveloped in Māyā represent the state of wakefulness in the midst of the thirteen-fold division of the reality, pralayākala and vijñānākala stand for the states of dream and sound sleep respectively while the fourth state of consciousness stands for the Mantra, Mantreśvara and Mantramaheśvara. As distinct from all these, Sakti and Sambhu represent the state of transcendence.
svarūpaṃ jāgradanyattu prāgvatpralayakevale | svaṃ jāgratsvapnasupte dve turyādyatra ca pūrvavat |	b- In the division into thirteen principles, the state of wakefulness would remain constant as it did earlier. In the calculation of the state of dissolution, pralayākala, will also be included the states of dream and dreamless sleep along with vijñānākala and its power.
vijñānākalabhede'pi svaṃ mantrā mantranāyakāḥ| tadīśāḥ śaktiśaṃbhvitthaṃ pañca syurjāgradādayaḥ |	The vijñānākala would also include Mantra, Mantreśvara and Mantramaheśvara, Sakti and Sambhu along with the five states of Sakala, etc., jāgrat, svapna, suspti, turiya and turiyātita, would stand for their Lords.
saptabhede tu mantrākhye svaṃ mantreśā maheśvarāḥ | śakti śaṃbhuśca pañcoktā avasthā jāgradādayaḥ |	- The division into seven entities is inclusive of Mantra, Mantreśa, Mantramaheśvara, Sakti, Sambhu and the five states of consciousness.
svarūpaṃ mantramāheśī śaktirmantramaheśvaraḥ | śaktiḥ śaṃbhurimāḥ pañca mantreśe pañcabhedake | svaṃ kriyā jñānamicchā ca śaṃbhuratra ca pañcamī | maheśabhede trividhe jāgradādi nirūpitam |	Śrī Tantrāloka The division into five entities is inclusive of Mantra, Mantreśvara, Mantramaheśvara, Sakti and Sambhu along with His three forces, namely, knowing, willing and doing. Even though one, Siva is found in five forms, namely, action, active rulership, rulership in the form of instigation, retreat from desiring and self-contentedness.
vyāpārādādhipatyācca taddhānyā prerakatvataḥ | icchānivṛtteḥ svasthatvācchiva eko'pi pañcadhā | |	It is the state where perception is of the objective world instead of the subjective and is also known as the state of prameya, the state of knower of the objective world. The second is known as pralayakala which is the state of negation of the objective world where only two malas remain namely, māyīya, and āṇava.
ityeṣa darśito'smābhistattvādhvā vistarāda| kalādhvā vakṣyate śrīmacchāṃbhavājñānusārataḥ |	In this state the perceiver is afflicted by āṇava mala which is also known vijñānākala pramātṛ śakti.
yathā pūrvoktabhuvanamadhye nijanijaṃ gaṇam | anuyatparato bhinnaṃ tattvaṃ nāmeti bhaṇyate | tathā teṣvapi tattveṣu svavarge'nugamātmakam | vyāvṛttaṃ paravargācca kaleti śivaśāsane |	The gaps between the waking state and the dreaming, and dreaming state and the deep sleep are important points since herein transition takes place from one state to another. An ordinary person is not aware of these gaps but the yogin is mindful of these gaps since these gaps are the state of felicity or turiya. Similarly in our thought-process there are also gaps between one thought and another.
kecidāhuḥ punaryāsau śaktirantaḥ susūkṣmikā | tattvānāṃ sā kaletyuktā dharaṇyāṃ dhārikā yathā |	- Some authorities have contended that kalā is the subtle and inner power which defines the specific nature of things as is the case of denomination of the earth as dharani on account of its function of supporting the existence of all whatever lies on it.
atra pakṣadvaye vastu na bhinnaṃ bhāsate yataḥ | anugāmi na sāmānyamiṣṭaṃ naiyāyikādivat |	In the case of the example of the earth as quoted, there is nothing significant between the two views as in our view the means of inference is by no means a general as against the position of the Naiyāyikas.
anye vadanti dīkṣādau sukhasaṃgrahaṇārthataḥ | śivena kalpito varga kaleti samayāśrayaḥ |	Some authorities think that kalā is that category of reality which has been conceived by Śiva to stand for the time suitable for the reception of initiation, etc. easily.
kṛtaśca devadevena samayo'paramārthatām | na gacchatīti nāsatyo na cānyasamayodayaḥ |	As an answer to the above proposition the author states that since time is created by the Supreme Lord, it can neither be ephemeral, nor untrue nor does it leave any scope for choice of any other occasion.
nivṛttiḥ pṛthivītattve pratiṣṭhāvyaktagocare | vidyā niśānte śāntā ca śaktyante'ṇḍamidaṃ catuḥ |	Retreat, nivrtti, obtains in the earth, stability in the unmanifest, knowledge as well as silence in the end of ignorance.
śāntatātītā śive tattve kalātītaḥ paraḥ śivaḥ | na hyatra vargīkaraṇaṃ samaya kalanāpi vā | yujyate sarvatodikkaṃ svātantryollāsadhāmani |	Transcendence of peace is the state of Śiva. The Parama Siva is also transcendent to time. Definitely, therefore, there is no scope for any kind of classification Deliberation on Time and Kalā or calculation in Him as He obtains everywhere besides being the source of autonomy.
svātantryāttu nijaṃ rūpaṃ boddhadharmādavicyutama | | upadeśatadāveśaparamārthatvasiddhaye | bodhyatāmānayandevaḥ sphuṭameva vibhāvyate |	-a On account of His autonomy, He has retained inseparably with Him His attribute as the knower to be imparted to His aspirant through instruction so as to get ingressed into Him. The Lord is expressly conceived as the harbinger of awareness.
yato'taḥ śivatattve'pi kalāsaṃgatirucyate | aṇḍaṃ ca nāma bhuvanavibhāgasthitikāraṇam |	This is why presence of kalā in Him is nothing but appropriate. b-a Anda is the basis of the stability of division in the creation.
prāhurāvaraṇaṃ tacca śaktyantaṃ yāvadasti hi | yadyapi prāk śivākhye'pi tattve bhuvanapaddhatiḥ | uktā tathāpyapratighe nāsminnāvṛtisaṃbhavaḥ | nanvevaṃ dharaṇīṃ muktvā śaktau prakṛtimāyayoḥ |	It is an enclosure insofar as it stands for the extremity of Śakti. b-a Although statement has been made earlier that there is division of worlds in the concept of Siva, yet there is no place for any enclosure in Him as He is unbounded. b-a Now, apart from the earth, since forces of both the prakrti and māya, too, are unbounded, there should not be any possibility of spheres, andatva, in them.
api cāpratighatve'pi kathamaṇḍasya saṃbhavaḥ | atrāsmadguravaḥ prāhuryatpṛthivyādipañcakam | pratyakṣamidamābhāti tato'nyannāsti kiṃcana| meyatve sthūlasūkṣmatvānmānatve karaṇatvataḥ | kartṛtollāsataḥ kartubhāve sphuṭatayoditam | triṃśattattvaṃ vibhedātma tadabhedo niśā matā |	are perceptively there before us, it is but natural for us to think that there is nothing besides them to play the role either of the object of knowledge or of the standard of knowledge in its concrete or subtle form or even in the form of the knower. b- On account of the agent of knowledge explicitly emerging from within them, the entire group of thirty elements play all these roles of object, subject and standard by themselves through participation variously by themselves in the act of manifestation. Beyond this diversion of multiplicity amongst them, all is conceived as purely the night of ignorance.
kāryatvakaraṇatvādivibhāgagalane sati | vikāsotkasvatantratve śivāntaṃ pañcakaṃ jaguḥ |	This process of participation of these elements via the four stages of wakefulness, dream, sound sleep and the fourth results in the emergence of the action, means of action, standard of action and actor ultimately ends at the fifth state of access to Śiva in the state of the transcendent consciousness characterised by autonomy of will for progress.
śrīmatkālottarādau ca kathitaṃ bhūyasā tathā | pañcaitāni tu tattvāni yairvyāptamakhilaṃ jagat | pañcamantratanau tena sadyojātādi bhaṇyate | īśānāntaṃ tatra tatra dharādigaganāntakam |	In the well-known texts like Kālottara, etc. it has abundantly been stated that it is by these five elements that the entire world is pervaded. Deliberation on Time and Kalā On the same account, it has been stated in the text known as Pañcatanu that beginning from the earth, which has been born right now and ending with Isa, all including water, fire, air and space, are the basic elements obtaining the world.
śivatattvamataḥ śūnyātiśūnyaṃ syādanāśritam | yattu sarvāvibhāgātma svatantraṃ bodhasundaram | saptatriṃśaṃ tu tatprāhustattvaṃ paraśivābhidham | tasyāpyuktanayādvedyabhāve'tra parikalpite | yadāste hyanavacchinnaṃ tadaṣṭātriṃśamucyate |	The element of Śiva, therefore, needs to be regarded as self-dependent and the void of void. That which is the basis of all divisions, self-dependent and pure consciousness, is the thirty-seventh element in that row known as bearing the name Parama Śiva -a. In keeping with the logic in the determination of the states of the reality, there does not seem to lie any impropriety in terming the Supernal Consciousness as the additional thirty-eighth principle in this row.
na cānavasthā hyevaṃ syādṛśyatāṃ hi mahātmabhiḥ |	b-a In this vision of the high-souled, there is no fault.
yadvedyaṃ kiñcidābhāti tatkṣaye yatprakāśate | tattattvamiti nirṇītaṃ ṣaṭtriṃśaṃ hṛdi bhāsate |	On the elimination of whatever is realised as the manifest form of the reality, what comes to the fore in the centre of our being has been determined as the thirty-sixth principle.
tatkiṃ na kiṃ kiñcidityākāṅkṣāvaśe vapuḥ | cidānandasvatantraikarūpaṃ taditi deśane | saptatriṃśaṃ samābhāti tatrākāṅkṣā ca nāparā |	b- What that thirty-sixth principle is kind of or is it not anything at all? On the arousal of this doubt, it is indicated as that, which, indeed, is of the nature of the continuum of consciousness-delight, autonomy and appears the thirty-seventh leaving no scope for any further query.
taccāpi klṛptavedyatvaṃ yatra bhāti sa cinmayaḥ | aṣṭātriṃśattamaḥ so'pi bhāvanāyopadiśyate | yadi nāma tataḥ saptatriṃśa eva punarbhavet | |	-a If any further query arises in regard to that reality, the answer would ultimately be that it is the same consciousness and if for the sake of fulfilment of the requirement of satisfaction of ideation, it is termed as the thirty-eighth, then also it would coincide only with the same thirty-seventh again.
avibhāgasvatantratvacinmayatvādidharmatā | samaiva vedyīkaraṇaṃ kevalaṃ tvadhikaṃ yataḥ |	b- Indivisibility, autonomy and consciousness are the features obtaining in common in all the entities excepting for the pure knowingness which is peculiar to only Siva.
dharāyāṃ guṇatattvānte māyānte kramaśaḥ sthitāḥ | gandho raso rūpamantaḥ sūkṣmabhāvakrameṇa tu | |	In the earth there is smell, in prakrti there is taste, rasa, in māyā there is form. These sensibilities obtain in these entities in the subtle to subtler form.
iti sthite naye śaktitattvānte'pyasti saukṣmyabhāk | sparśaḥ ko'pi sadā yasmai yoginaḥ spṛhayālavaḥ |	In keeping with this order obtaining in these entities, there must be some sort of sensibility of touch at the end of them for which yogins have keen aspiration.
tatsparśānte tu saṃvittiḥ śuddhacidvyomarūpiṇī | yasyāṃ rūḍhaḥ samabhyeti spaprakāśātmikāṃ parām |	In transcendence of that sensibility of touch lies consciousness in the form of pure space. Having ascended to that state, the yogin gets access to the Supernal Consciousness which is self-luminous.
ato bindurato nādo rūpamasmādato rasaḥ | ityukta kṣobhakatvena spande sparśastu no tathā |	- Deliberation on Time and Kalā In course of the yogic practice, first of all emerges bindu, point followed by sound, nāda, form, rūpa, and taste, rasa as objects of agitation but not touch, sparśa, according to the statement of Spanda Sāstra.
mataṃ caitanmaheśasya śrīpūrve yadabhāṣata| dhārikāpyāyinī bodhrī pavitro cāvakāśadā |	In view of Lord Śiva, as expressed in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra, the qualities of the five elements respectively are supportance, obtention, awakening, purgatory and space-giving.
ebhiḥ śabdairvyavaharan nivṛttyādernijaṃ vapuḥ | pañcatattvavidhiḥ proktastritattvamadhunocyate |	Practising meditation in keeping with the sense of these words on the respective elements, the practitioner gets rid of the burden of his body. -a The method of getting eased up to the five elements has been explained.
vijñānākalaparyantamātmā vidyeśvarāntakam | śeṣe śivastritattve syādekatattve śivaḥ param |	Now is going to be explained how to get eased on the three subsequent planes. The Self obtains up to the plane of vijñānākala, vidyā up to Isvara while the remaining stretch belongs to Siva, the Supreme.
imau bhedāvubhau tattvabhedamātrakṛtāviti | tattvādhvaivāyamitthaṃ ca na ṣaḍadhvasthiteḥ kṣatiḥ |	b- These two divisions are based on only distinctions amongst the entities. As such, they are only varieties of the path making the same complete the number of them as six without making any transgression on it.
prakṛt pumānyatiḥ kālo māyā vidyeśasauśivau | śivaśca navatattve'pi vidhau tattvādhvarūpatā |	एवमष्टादशाख्येsपि विधौ न्यायं वदेत्सुधीः । Nature, prakrti, Person, pumān, Dynamics, yati Time, kāla, Māya, principle of creation, Vidyā principle of knowing, Iśvara, God, Sadāśiva and Siva are the nine principles-cum-entities on which is based the principle of six paths.
yatra yatra hi bhogecchā tatprādhānyopayogataḥ | |	-a Mainly as per the wish for the locus of enjoyment bhoga as also in view of any other desire, initiations are innumerable in number and kinds.
anyāntarbhāvanātaśca dīkṣānantavibhedabhāk | tena ṣaṭtriṃśato yāvadekatattvavidhirbhavet | | tattvādhvaiva sa devena prokto vyāsasamāsataḥ | ekatattvavidhiścaiṣa suprabuddhaṃ guru prati |	b-a The Lord, however, has enunciated uniformly only one mode of initiation within the range of the doctrine of thirty-six principles both in summary and detail. b-a Sambhu has recommended the mode of initiation into the non-dual principle only in the case of the teacher who is himself very well enlightened and the disciple has crossed the barrier of the desire for enjoyment.
svātmanyabhinne bhagavānnityaṃ viśramayan sthitaḥ | itthaṃ tryātmādhvano bhedaḥ sthūlasūkṣmaparatvataḥ |	b-a The Lord is continuing to divide His oneness into the multitude of entities and beings by means of His force of autonomy, however, without getting Himself anyway divided and yet remains resting in His undivided oneness.
meyabhāgagataḥ proktaḥ puratattvakalātmakaḥ | adhunā mātṛbhāgasthaṃ rūpaṃ tredhā nirūpyate |	b-a Deliberation on Time and Kalā Thus have been explained the kinds of the path from the viewpoint of their tangible, subtle and transcendent forms as also that of their locus, essence and modes of variation and participation in the process of objectification. Now is going to be elucidated their subjectification in triple forms.
yatpramāṇātmakaṃ rūpamadhvano mātṛbhāgagam | padaṃ hyavagamātmatvasamāveśātaducyate |	b- The element of the standard of knowledge obtaining in the knower assumes the form of pada, locus, owing to ingression of understanding into it.
tadeva ca padaṃ mantraḥ prakṣobhātpracyutaṃ yadā | guptabhāṣī yato mātā tūrṇībhūto vyavasthitaḥ |	The same pada becomes mantra when removed from its locus due to some sort of agitation in it. As a result of it, the knower stops from speech and remains completely silent and settled within himself.
tathāpi na vimarśātmarūpaṃ tyajati tena saḥ | pramāṇātmavimarśātmā mānavatkṣobhabhāṅ na tu |	- Complete silence on the part of the aspirant does by no means amount to his complete stoppage from contemplation. Indeed, his contemplation is of the nature of standard of knowledge rid of the agitation of the ordinary human life.
mantrāṇāṃ ca padānāṃ ca tenoktaṃ trikaśāsane | abhinnameva svaṃ rūpaṃ niḥspandakṣobhite param |	Therefore, as per the principle of the Trika system, mantras and padas are almost one and the same in their statuses, while the Supreme Being is rid of agitation as well as movement.
audāsīnyaparityāṃge prakṣobhānavarohaṇe | varṇādhvā mātṛbhāge syāt pūrvaṃ yā kathitā pramā |	- On desertion of indifference and lack of descent of agitation, the sacred path of letter ought to turn towards the knower which previously was termed as pramā, knowledge, which is shorn of division on account of perfection.
tata ekaikavarṇatvaṃ tatve tatve kṣamāditaḥ | | kṛtvā śaive pare proktāḥ ṣoḍaśārṇā visargataḥ | tatra śaktiparispandastāvān prāk ca nirūpitaḥ |	-a In the Saivite system of spiritual practice each consonant from k to ks stands for one of the elements along with each one of the sixteen vowels including what stands for emission and thus all of them totalling thirty-six. b-a In this regard, so far as the dynamics of the Sakti is concerned, its source as Siva has already been explained.
saṃkalayyocyate sarvamadhunā sukhasaṃvide| padamantravarṇamekaṃ puraṣoḍaśakaṃ dhareti ca nivṛttiḥ| tattvārṇamagninayanaṃ rasaśarapuramastramantrapadamanyā |	b I, Abhinavagupta, have presented the details of the six paths summarily for the sake of easy understanding of my students in the form of these three verses in the meter known as Āryā. The details are as follows: Pada, Mantra and letter are represented by a single letter ks. The sixteen states of being, pura, are those as beginning from Rudra and ending with Virabhadra. The earth stands for the retreat.
munitattvārṇaṃ dvikapadamantraṃ vasvakṣibhuvanamaparakalā | agnyarṇatattvamekaikapadamantraṃ sainyabhuvanamiti turyā |	The elements constituting the universe are thirty-two as beginning with water and ending with the Unmanifest. Twenty- three is the number of the letters in the alphabet beginning from ½ and ending with n which represent these elements.
ṣoḍaśa varṇāḥ padamantratattvamekaṃ ca śāntyatīteyam | abhinavaguptenāryātrayamuktaṃ saṃgrahāya śiṣyebhyaḥ |	Twenty-eight are the planes of being bhuvana of the lower category. The three fires stand for the letters g, kh and k and represent knowledge, Sakti and Śiva as also the mantra separately. The number eighteen stands for the kalā known as śāntā.
| so'yaṃ samasta evādhvā bhairavābhedavṛttimān tatsvātantryātsvatantratvamaśnuvāno'vabhāsate |	The one tattva essence is indicatory of Śiva and Sakti combined into one. - This entire group of six paths exists in oneness with Bhairava. It obtains enjoying autonomy, sharing the same with His independence.
tathā hi mātṛrūpastho mantrādhveti nirūpitaḥ | tathā hi cidvimarśena grastā vācyadaśā yadā | śivajñānakriyāyattamananatrāṇatatparā | aśeṣaśaktipaṭalīlīlālāmpaṭyapāṭavāt |	- The path of mantra is embedded in the knower. This has been elucidated as such. For example, when the object of speech becomes engrossed by contemplation on consciousness, and thus becomes engaged in deliberating on the knowledge and protective action of Śiva, due to the play of the Sakti, the Force in its entirety, getting rid of its form of the standard of knowledge, consciousness assumes the role of the path of Mantra.
tathā hi māturviśrāntirvarṇānsaṃghaṭya tānbahūna | saṃghaṭṭanaṃ ca kramika saṃjalpātmakameva tat |	This is how having played the role of the standard of knowledge, it assumes the form of the locus of the path. - For instance, the knower comes to rest in his process of knowing by combining several letters together.
vikalpasya svakaṃ rūpaṃ bhogāveśamayaṃ sphuṭam | ataḥ pramāṇatārūpaṃ padamasmadgururjagau |	The process of combination involves graduality both in placing as well as in pronouncing while conceiving of the resultant novel meaning is oriented to the objective of enjoyment. Consequently, it assumes the form of the standard of knowledge. This has been explained to us by our teacher.
jñānaṃ na jāyate kiñcidupaṣṭambhanavajitam | pramāṇarūpatāveśamaparityajya meyatām |	- There is no possibility of any knowledge without combining of letters into words.
gacchankalanayā yogādadhvā proktaḥ kalātmakaḥ | śuddhe prameyatāyoge sūkṣmasthūlatvabhāgina | |	The path gets related to kalā on account of involving in it the process of calculation.
tattvādhvabhuvanādhvatve krameṇānusaredguruḥ | prameyamānamātṛṇāṃ yadrūpamuparisthitam | pramātmātra sthito'dhvāyaṃ parṇātmā dṛśyatāṃ kila | ucchalatsaṃvidāmātraviśrāntyāsvādayoginaḥ |	In the process of transformation of anything into the object of pure knowledge, no matter the same be subtle or gross, the teacher of this philosophy needs to pay attention to the point of the change of the course from the essential to the spacial. -a The path of letters, varnādhvā, needs to be taken as that state at which the knower, standard and object of knowledge as discussed above, become coincident in the form of sheer knowledge.
sarvābhidhānasāmarthyādaniyantritaśaktayaḥ | sṛṣṭāḥ svātmasahotthe'rthe dharāparyantabhāgina | āmṛśantaḥ svacidbhūmau tāvato'rthānabhedataḥ | varṇaughāste pramārūpāṃ satyāṃ vibhrati saṃvidam |	b-a The entire group of fifty letters bearing within it and thus enjoying the taste Deliberation on Time and Kalā of the awareness of all the denominations reposes in the consciousness, being imbued with unlimited force. These letters are created along with the co- born entities up to the earth. Remaining contemplating on the ground of their consciousness on all those meanings, it is they who indeed are the real bearers of the consciousness.
bālāstiryakpramātāro ye'pyasaṃketabhāgina | te'pyakṛtrimasaṃskārasārāmenāṃ svasaṃvidam |	b- Such innocent knowers as children, birds and animals who have remained so far ignorant of indications, they as well, having received this inner awareness bearing with it the essence of all impressions in their own ways become peculiar knowers.
bhinnabhinnāmupāśritya yānti citrāṃ pramātṛtām | asyāṃ cākṛtrimānantavarṇasaṃvidi rūḍhatām |	-a In this limitless spectrum of the natural consciousness embodied in these letters indications becomes fixed to the extent as to get their indicatory character transformed into the actuality of the objects they are indicative of.
aviśrāntatayā kuryuranavasthāṃ duruttarām | bālo vyutpādyate yena tatra saṃketamārgaṇāt | aṅgulyādeśane'pyasya nāvikalpā tathā matiḥ | vikalpa śabdamūlaśca śabda saṃketajīvitaḥ | tenānanto hyāmāyīyo yo varṇagrāma īdṛśaḥ | saṃvidvimarśasacivaḥ sadaiva sa hi jṛmbhate |	b-a Lacking in its access to the consciousness indications go on being created one after the other without finding any point of rest and thus stand the danger of the fault like a child being made to understand something by way of indication. b- Indicating by fingers do not generate awareness sufficient to bring conviction since variation in understanding has its root in words and serves as the spirit of meaning intended to be conveyed. Thus, the role of alphabet is such as to convey the definite sense and, as such, it serves as the companion of consciousness in its act of contemplation.
yata eva ca māyīyā varṇāḥ sūtiṃ vitenire | ye ca māyīyavarṇeṣu vīryatvena nirūpitāḥ |	Only those letters need to be regarded as independent of indications which are imbued with the power sufficient to generate the intended sense as their burden of awareness.
saṃketanirapekṣāste prameti parigṛhyatām | tathā hi paravākyeṣu śruteṣvāvriyate nijā |	-a Foolish is he whose capacity of understanding remains blunted even after listening to instructions of others and hence does not deserve the status of the knower.
pramā yasya jaḍo'sau no tatrārthe'bhyeti mātṛtām | śukavatsa paṭhatyeva paraṃ tatkramitaikabhāk | svātantryalābhataḥ svavākyapramālābhe tu boddhṛtā | yasya hi svapramābodho vipakṣodbhedanigrahāt | vākyādivarṇapuñje sve sa pramātā vaśībhavet | yathā yathā cākṛtakaṃ tadrupamatiricyate |	b-a Such a foolish man may repeat the particular word like a parrot however in its right context awaiting out of his autonomy prospect of reaching the state of understanding of its real meaning which alone would generate the corresponding awareness in him. b-a Deliberation on Time and Kalā He who is capable of breaking the knot of argument of the opposite side resulting in the arousal of his own understanding in the matter concerned in regard to the group of letters presented in the form of sentence, etc., needs to be regarded as the real knower and winner of the contest.
tathā tathā camatkāratāratamyaṃ vibhāvyate | ādyāmāyīvarṇāntarnimagne cottarottare |	b-a As the knower proceeds transcending the level of his original understanding stage after stage, excellence after excellence of consciousness goes on manifesting before him.

dhruvaṃ kavitvavaktṛtvaśālitāṃ yānti sarvataḥ | yāvaddhāmani saṅketanikārakalanojjhite | |	b-a Along with the initial unfoldment of the talent when persons get established in the reflective genius lying inherent within them, they are sure to develop into poets and orators to be recognised as such all around.
viśrāntaścinmaye kiṃ kiṃ na vetti kurute na vā | ata eva hi vāksiddhau varṇānāṃ samupāsyatā | | sarvajñavādisiddhau vā kā siddhiryā na tanmayī | taduktaṃ varadena śrīsiddhayogīśvarīmate | tena guptena guptāste śeṣā varṇāstviti sphuṭam | evaṃ māmātṛmānatvameyatvairyo'vabhāsate | |	b-a So long as he remains reposed in the abode or light of consciousness rid of the adjunct of indication and calculation, what does he not know and what can he not accomplish? b-a Śrī Tantrāloka This is how the utility of letters has been recognised for the sake of getting accomplished in oration as well as in the display of the skill of all-knowingness which has been obtained by him as inherent in him. b-a As has been stated in the Siddhayogīśvari Text by the boon-granting Siva mysteriously that this is why these particular letters have been kept secret as distinct from those which have remained open to all.
ṣaḍvidhaḥ svavapuḥ śuddhau śuddhiṃ so'dhvādhigacchati | ekena vapuṣā śuddhau tatraivānyaprakāratām |	b-a Thus what appears purified in respect of its knowledge, knowingness, knower and the object of knowledge is the path in all its six-fold-ness which is coincident to one's body.
antarbhāvyācarecchuddhimanusaṃdhānavān guruḥ | anantarbhāvaśaktau tu sūkṣmaṃ sūkṣmaṃ tu śodhayet |	b-a On the act of purification having been accomplished even in one respect the worthy teacher needs to understand the same in all respects. b-a In case of inability to purify all aspects of the personality, the teacher needs to purify their subtle forms.
tadviśuddhaṃ bījabhāvāt sūte nottarasaṃtatim | śodhanaṃ bahudhā tattadbhogaprāptyekatānatā |	On the seed-form getting purified, no more would it be able to prolong its continuity.
tadādhipatyaṃ tattyāgastacchivātmatvavedanam | tallīnatā tannirāsaḥ sarvaṃ caitatkramākramāt | |	b-a Deliberation on Time and Kalā Purification of the disciple amounts to breaking the continuity of impressions concerning the acquisition, ownership and enjoyment of objects of desire, and redirecting the desire from them towards getting gradually oneness with Siva.
ata eva ca te mantrā śodhakāñcitrarūpiṇaḥ| siddhāntavāmadakṣādau citrāṃ śuddhiṃ vitanvate |	b- Thus, it is evident that these purifying mantras are of peculiar forms as they are meant for purifying the disciple in both the left and right aspects as well as in regard to the doctrine itself.
anuttaratrikānāmakramamantrāstu ye kila | te sarve sarvadāḥ kintu kasyacit kvāpi mukhyatā |	They all are capable of granting everything in every way, however, with the specification of the priority of someone somewhere and subordination of the rest in that case.
ataḥ śodhakabhāvena śāstre śrīpūrvasaṃjñite | parāparādimantrāṇāmadhvanyuktā vyavasthitiḥ | |	Therefore, in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra in regard to their usage in the ceremony of purification, the priority and posteriority of different mantras has been settled.
śodhakatvaṃ ca mālinyā devīnāṃ tritayasya ca | devatrayasya vaktrāṇāmaṅgānāmaṣṭakasya ca | |	The purificatory nature of the mantras is effective in the case of the triad of the goddesses of Mālini, that of the gods, eight-foldness of faces and limbs of the bodies leaving apart only the door, structure, base tradition of teacher, system of arms, and the guard of the people.
yaccaitadadhvanaḥ proktaṃ śodhyatvaṃ śoddhṛtā ca yā | sā svātantryācchivābhede yuktetyuktaṃ ca śāsane |	- Śrī Tantrāloka Whatever has been said above in regard to the purification of the path and purifying force of mantras, that is associated with oneness with Śiva's autonomy. This has been laid down in sacred texts.
sarvametadvibhātyeva parameśitari dhruve | pratibimbasvarūpeṇa na tu bāhyatayā yataḥ |	The entire world is getting reflected in the Supreme Lord who is eternally constant as a reflection appearing in the mirror without having any existence apart from the actual.
cidvyomnyeva śive sattadehādimatirīdṛśī | bhinnā saṃsāriṇāṃ rajjau sarpasragvīcibuddhivat |	In the space-like consciousness of Śiva is appearing the entire variety of entities like bodies, etc. like the appearance of snake, rosary, wave, etc. in the eye of the worldly people.
yataḥ prāgdehamaraṇasiddhāntaḥ svapnagocaraḥ | dehāntarādirmaraṇe kīdṛgvā dehasaṃbhavaḥ |	The incidence of death appears as a sheer dream to the individual at the prime state of his childhood as also the possibility of entering into another body after death.
svapne'pi pratibhāmātrasāmānyaprathanābalāt | viśeṣāḥ pratibhāsante na bhāvyante'pi te yathā | |	In the state of dream also figures appear as actual due to the power of reflection in consciousness even without any possibility of occurrence in actuality.
śālagrāmopalāḥ keciccitrākṛtiśṛtī yathā | tathā māyādibhūmyantalekhācitrahṛdaścitaḥ |	Deliberation on Time and Kalā As pieces of stone found on the river-bed in Śālagrāma are adorned with peculiar figures appearing on them, even so entities from Māyā to the earth have engraved outlines of various sorts of figures in the core of their being.
nagarārṇavaśailādyāstadicchānuvidhāyinaḥ | na svayaṃ sadasanto no kāraṇākāraṇātmakā |	Towns, oceans, mountains, etc. are the follow-ups of the principle of wish of the Supreme Lord being in themselves neither real nor unreal, neither cause nor effect.
niyateścirarūḍhāyāḥ samucchedātpravartanāt | arūḍhāyāḥ svatantro'yaṃ sthitaścidvyomabhairavaḥ | ekacinmātrasaṃpūrṇabhairavābhedabhāgini | evamasmītyanāmarśo bhedako bhāvamaṇḍale |	On account of the eternal consciousness acting as the factor of determination in the course of the acts of dissolution and creation in all its autonomy all this in the form of the world is taking place in the space of consciousness of Bhairava lying there in His freedom. Since Bhairava is sheer consciousness one and the same without any possibility of division in Him, the notion of self-assertion in the individual is the sole factor of appearance of division in the entire spectrum of entities.
sarvapramāṇaino siddhaṃ svapne kartrantaraṃ yathā | svasaṃvidaḥ svasiddhāyāstathā sarvatra buddhyatām |	No matter whatever standard of knowledge be applied, we cannot prove the role of anyone else besides the self-proved consciousness behind the creation of dreams. So needs to be understood in the creation of everything.
cittacitrapurodyāne krīḍedevaṃ hi vetti yaḥ | ahameva sthito bhūtabhāvatattvapurairiti |	While playing in the garden of peculiar scenes and scenario as the world is, he who understands that it is I myself who is all these entities, ideas, elements, etc.
evaṃ jāto mṛto'smīti janmamṛtyuvicitratāḥ | ajanmanyamṛtau bhānti cittabhitau svanirmitāḥ |	'I was born like this and died like this', this is the peculiarity of life and death sketched out by oneself on the wall of one's own consciousness which remains immune to life and death.
parehasaṃvidāmātraṃ paralokehalokate | vastutaḥ saṃvido deśaḥ kālo vā naiva kiṃcana |	The idea of the outer world and this world is barely notional in the context of consciousness as there is no scope in it either for time or space.
abhaviṣyadayaṃ sargo mūrtaścenna tu cinmayaḥ | tadavekṣyata tanmadhyāt kenaiko'pi dharādharaḥ | bhūtatanmātravargāderādhārādheyatākrame | ante saṃvinmayī śakti śivarūpaiva dhāriṇī |	This creation would have been born in all its tangibility and hence it is not sheer consciousness. This assumption would require the answer as to who is its bearer and by what is the entity that is holding it in its place ? Under the assumption of the elements, bhūta, having been born of the tanmātrās as the basics and the products of them, we cannot but end with the admittance of the consciousness-force as the bearer in the form of Śiva Himself.
tasmātpratītirevetthaṃ kartrī dhartrī ca sā śivaḥ | tato bhāvāḥ śaktirādhārikā tataḥ |	Therefore, it becomes obvious that consciousness itself is the creatrix and Deliberation on Time and Kalā sustainer of everything being Śiva Himself. From her are born and on her are sustained all the entities.
sāṃkalpikaṃ nirādhāramapi naiva patatyadhaḥ | svādhāraśaktau viśrāntaṃ viśvamitthaṃ vimṛśyatām |	As such, she is neither sustainer nor creatrix The universe needs to be contemplated as a creation of sheer imagination and as self-sustained. This is why it does not fall down.
asyā dhanāhamityādirūḍhireva dharāditā | yāvadante cidasmīti nirvṛttā bhairavātmatā |	Idea of the earth that I am dense', etc. is the secret cause of its earthiness. When ultimately it would come to the motion that 'I am sheer consciousness' it would get dissolved into Bhairava-hood.
maṇāvindrāyudhe bhāsa iva nīlādayaḥ śive | paramārthata eṣāṃ tu nodayo na vyayaḥ kvacit | |	Just as blueness in the gem as well as in the rainbow is merely notional, so appear entities of the world in Siva and really neither do they ever arise nor subside.
deśe kāle'tra vā sṛṣṭirityetadasamañjasam | cidātmanā hi devena sṛṣṭirdikkālayorapi |	Whether this act of creation has taken place in space or in time? On this disquisition, the fact is that even space and time are creations of the Lord by virtue of His being pure consciousness.
jāgarābhimate sārdhahastatritayagocare | prahare ca pṛthak svapnāścitradikkālamāninaḥ |	In the body measuring just three and a half fore-arm-lengths and during just a prahara, three hour's time, dreams appear covering peculiar expanse of space and duration of time.
ata eva kṣaṇaṃ nāma na kiñcidapi manmahe | kriyākṣaṇe vāpyekasmin baḍhyaḥ saṃsyurdutāḥ kriyāḥ |	Therefore, we think that moment has no real entity. In single moment of action so many acts may be accomplished hurriedly.
tena ye bhāvasaṅkocaṃ kṣaṇāntaṃ pratipedire | te nūnamenayā nāḍyā śūnyadṛṣṭyavalambinaḥ |	On account of this being the fact, those who hold the view of moment as the last contracted form of being, need to apply the same formula to the present context and see whether they themselves have not lost in nihilism.
eṣa sato bhāvān śūnyīkartu tathāsataḥ | kartu svatantratvādīśaḥ so'smatprabhuḥ śivaḥ | |	Our Lord Śiva by virtue of His autonomy is capable of turning into nothing whatever is in existence as well as bringing into existence whatever is non- existent at the moment.
taditthaṃ parameśāno viśvarūpaḥ pragīyate | na tu bhinnasya dharāderupapannatā | |	This is why the Supreme Lord has been declared as of universal form annulling the possibility of the earth, etc. as separate from Him.
uktaṃ caitatpuraiveti na bhūyaḥ pravivicyate | bhūyobhiścāpi bāhyārthadūṣaṇaiḥ pravyaramyata |	On account of all this having been explained earlier itself, there is no necessity of going through the same details anymore, hence, it is now the time to stop from getting defiled by projecting ourselves outside.
taditthameṣa nirṇītaḥ kalādervistaro'dhvanaḥ |	This is how we have concluded our deliberation on the path of kalā, etc.
athādhvano'sya prakṛta upayogaḥ prakāśyate |	Tattvādhvan - Analysis of Basic Essences of the Path...
itthamadhvā samasto'yaṃ yathā saṃvidi saṃsthitaḥ | taddvārā śūnyadhīprāṇanāḍocatanuṣva |	Duality, at this state, is only conceptual but there is no division or limitation. Except for Siva-tattva, Śakti- anda contains all the pure tattvas -- sakti, Śadāśiva, Iśvara and śuddha-vidyā.
bahiśca liṅgamūrtyagnisthaṇḍilādiṣu sarvataḥ | tathā sthitaḥ samastaśca vyastaścaiṣa kramākramāt |	Prthvi-aṇḍa is the culmination point of creation, i.e., solid mater and it is the only constituent tattva in this sphere. It has a special status since it is the home of kundalini sakti and contains in essence all the tattvas.
āsaṃvittattvamābāhyaṃ yo'yamadhvā vyavasthitaḥ | tatra tatrocitaṃ rūpaṃ svaṃ svātantryeṇa bhāsayet |	- The aspirant needs to contemplate on the entire path extending from the inner consciousness up to the world all around as one's own being from its limited individuality to the state of absolutely autonomous state of Siva-hood.
sarvaṃ sarvatra rūpaṃ ca tasyāpi na ca bhāsate | na hyavaccheditāṃ kvāpi svapne'pi viṣahāmahe |	We cannot dismiss that it is He who is being reflected in all forms everywhere without any division in Him not to be questioned about this even in the state of dream.
evaṃ viśvādhvasaṃpūrṇa kālavyāpāracitritam | deśakālamayaspandasadma dehaṃ vilokayet |	The aspirant should look towards his body contemplating how the entire universal path including time, space, action and events in all their forms and variations are vibrating in it turning it into the locus of all these vibrations.
tathā vilokyamāno'sau viśvāntardevatāmayaḥ | dhyeyaḥ pūjyaśca tarpyaśca tadāviṣṭo vimucyate |	Looking towards himself like this the aspirant becomes refulgent with the divinities on the universal scale, deserving to be meditated on, worshipped, satiated and thus owing to having been possessed by the state of Śiva, he becomes redeemed.
itthaṃ ghaṭaṃ paṭaṃ liṅga sthaṇḍilaṃ pustakaṃ jalam | yadvā kiñcitkvacitpaśyettatra tanmayatāṃ vrajet |	Practising like this, whatever may come to his sight, no matter, be it a jar, piece of cloth, emblem, bare piece of land, book or water, and wheresoever places, he should become one with it contemplating on it as a manifestation of his own Self which ultimately is Siva Himself.
tatrārpaṇaṃ hi vastūnāmabhedenārcanaṃ matam | tathā saṃpūrṇarūpatvānusaṃdhirdhyānamute |	Ānavopāya - Transformation of Individual to Śiva-hood At that level bestowal of all things as one with oneself is the real form of offering while thinking of oneself as all-inclusive is meditation.
saṃpūrṇatvānusaṃdhānamakampaṃ dārḍhyamānayan tathāntarjalpayogena vimṛṣañjapabhājanam |	Follow-up of oneself steadily without any tremor and integrally along with contemplation is to turn oneself into the locus of japa.
tatrārpitānāṃ bhāvānāṃ svakabhedavilāpanam | kurvastadraśmisadbhāvaṃ dadyāddhomakriyāparaḥ |	Whatever objects are offered with this frame of the inner being, result in dismissal of ownership being transformed into the rays of which the offering turns into oblation.
tathaivaṃkurvataḥ sarva samabhāvena paśyataḥ | niṣkampatā vrataṃ śuddhaṃ sāmyaṃ nandiśikhoditam |	- As the Nandisikhā has remarked, the aspirant who does like this and looks towards all with the sense of equanimity, he, as it were, is engaged steadily in the observation of the vow of pure equanimity.
tathārcanajapadhyānahomavratavidhikramāt | paripūrṇāṃ sthitiṃ prāhuḥ samādhiṃ guravaḥ purā |	Worshipping, meditating, offering of oblation and observing of vow, in this way, have been extolled by teachers in the past as the perfect state of absorption, samādhi.

vicikitsā galatyantastathāsau yatnavānbhavet | dhīkarmākṣagatā devīrniṣiddhaireva tarpayet | vīravrataṃ cābhinandediti bhargaśikhāvacaḥ | tathā hi śaṅkā mālinyaṃ glāniḥ saṃkoca ityadaḥ |	b-a Presiding deities of senses and organs of action need to be propitiated by means of even prohibited objects. As per the Bharga Śikhā Śāstra even Vira-vrata may be made use of. b-a ānavopāya Transformation of Individual to Siva-hood Doubt, defilement of consciousness, diffidence, constriction, etc., are causes of lodging the practitioner in the prison of the world with the necessity of getting enclosed within the bony frame of the body.

tatra kecidiha prāhuḥ śaktipāta imaṃ vidhim | taṃ pradarśya nirākṛtya svamataṃ darśayiṣyate |	Certain authorities have already put forward their respective views concerning the phenomenon of descent of force. I am, therefore, required to expose and refute them followed by presentation of my own view on it.
tatredaṃ dṛśyamānaṃ satsukhaduḥkhavimohabhāk | viṣamaṃ sattathābhūtaṃ samaṃ hetuṃ prakalpayet | so'vyaktaṃ tacca sattvādinānārūpamacetanam | ghaṭādivatkāryamiti hetureko'sya sā niśā |	Sri Tantrāloka Whatever is there before our sight is of the nature of pleasure, pain and swoon and hence of discordant nature. Being a sheer effect it needs to have been born of some cause. That cause is the unmanifest, avyakta, consisting of the three gunas known as sattva, rajas and tamas and is inconscient, and an effect like the jar, etc. having Prakrti as its cause.
sā jaḍā kāryatādrūpyātkāryaṃ cāsyāṃ sadeva hi | kalādidharaṇīprāntaṃ jāḍyātsā sūtaye'kṣamā |	- That Prakrti is inconscient as she gives birth to all the inanimate entities ranging from kalā to the earth. Since she is incapable of giving birth to anything by herself, she must have needed stimulation by the Lord, the stimulation amounting to fertilisation.
teneśaḥ kṣobhayedenāṃ kṣobho'syāḥ sūtiyogyatā | puṃsaḥ prati ca sā bhogyaṃ sūte'nādīn pṛthagvidhān |	As such, she must be the object of enjoyment of the Purusa due to being enjoyed by whom she has given birth to entities of various kinds of unborn status.
puṃsaśca nirviśeṣatve muktāṇūn prati kiṃ na tat | nimittaṃ karmasaṃskāraḥ sa ca teṣu na vidyate | iti cetkarmasaṃskārābhāvasteṣāṃ kutaḥ kila | na bhogādanyakarmāṃśaprasaṅgo hi duratyayaḥ | yugapatkarmaṇāṃ bhogo na ca yuktaḥ krameṇa hi | phaledyatkarma tatkasmātsvaṃ rūpaṃ saṃtyajetkvacit |	- Since the Purusas are unspecified by time, why is she not responsible for their birth? Impressions of past actions being the cause of birth, what was the basis of their coming into existence ? If it is argued that they were redeemed, muktānu, right from the beginning, what was the ground for their having been redeemed even right from that beginning since impressions of action are not eliminable without having been suffered? - Since there is graduality in the fruition of impressions, they cannot be enjoyed or suffered all at once.
jñānātkarmakṣayaścettatkuta īśvaracoditāt | dharmādyadi kutaḥ so'pi karmataścettaducyatām | nahi karmāsti tādṛkṣaṃ yena jñānaṃ pravartate | karmajatve ca tajjñānaṃ phalarāśau pated dhruvam |	Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... If it is posed that impressions can be eliminated by means of knowledge on account of the intervention of God, the question is what is the basis of God's intervention in the law of action? If it is replied in terms of virtue acquired through observance of righteousness in the form of right action, the problem is that there is no such action which may give rise to knowledge.
anyakarmaphalaṃ prācyaṃ karmarāśiṃ ca kiṃ dahet | īśasya dveṣarāgādiśūnyasyāpi kathaṃ kvacit |	Is there any probability of the effect of one old action burning down the stock of effects of a subsequent group of actions? Since the Lord is rid of both hatred and attachment, such discriminative intrigue on His part is impossible.
tathābhisaṃdhirnānyatra bhedahetorabhāvataḥ | nanvitthaṃ pradahejjñānaṃ karmajālāni karma hi |	-a Thus, there is every probability of knowledge as well as action done without craving for result burning down the net of actions, since action accomplished with the craving for attainment of heaven, etc.
ajñānasahakārīdaṃ sūte svargādikaṃ phalam | ajñānaṃ jñānato naśyedanyakarmaphalādapi |	Ignorance has the probability of getting eliminated through knowledge as well as a result of action done without craving for the result.
upavāsādikaṃ cānyaduṣṭakarmaphalaṃ bhavet | niṣphalīkurute duṣṭaṃ karmetyaṅgīkṛtaṃ kila |	b- On admittance of the necessity of knowledge as the pre-requisite of elimination of the effect of action, such pious acts as fasting, etc. may have the probability of generating evil effects and rendering ineffective results of evil acts.
ajñānamiti yatproktaṃ jñānābhāvaḥ sa cetsa kim | prāgabhāvo'thavā dhvaṃsa ādye kiṃ sarvasaṃvidām | kasyāpi vātha jñānasya prācyaḥ pakṣastvasaṃbhavī | na kiṃcidyasya vijñānamudapādi tathāvidhaḥ |	On admittance of ignorance, ajñāna, as absence of knowledge, one would also have to admit that at the primeval stage there was complete absence or loss of knowledge, which is not possible at all. There is no knowledge, as such, which was not into being before its awareness, as no such item of knowledge has ever been revealed. On admittance of the view of complete absence of knowledge at some early stage, all individuals would have to be accepted to have been dumb and fool like the jar, etc.
muktāṇorapi so'styeva janmataḥ prāgasau na ca | jñānaṃ bhāvi vimukte'sminniti cecacarcyatāmidam |	-a If we accept this view of complete absence of knowledge in persons yet to be born, this view would get extended to even liberated individuals since before his birth, he himself was not in being and the knowledge grew in him only after his birth.
kasmājjñānaṃ na bhāvyatra nanu dehādyajanmataḥ | tatkasmātkarmaṇaḥ kṣaiṇyāttatkuto'jñānahānitaḥ | ajñānasya kathaṃ hāniḥ prāgabhāve hi saṃvidaḥ | ajñānaṃ prāgabhāvo'sau na bhāvyutpattyasaṃbhadāt |	? That is due to impressions of their actions having been eliminated already and that also on account of elimination of ignorance in them prior to it. If it is asked as to how ignorance might have got eliminated prior to consciousness coming into being, the answer is that ignorance has not even prior presence in them and not to talk of being born subsequently. - Why birth of knowledge is not possible in redeemed individuals in spite of the fact of the birth of their bodies, senses, etc.
kasmānna bhāvi tajjñānaṃ nanu dehādyajanmataḥ | ityeṣa sarvapakṣaghno niśitaścakrakabhramaḥ |	at all? This is an arrow of wheel destined to move round and round killing all shades of views whichsoever.
atha pradhvaṃsa evedamajñānaṃ tatsadā sthitam | muktāṇuṣviti teṣvastu māyākāryavijṛmbhitam |	If ignorance were to be considered as the state of elimination of knowledge, then it would have to be regarded as ever-existing even in redeemed individuals as a result of operation of the factors such as māyā, etc.
athājñānaṃ na hyabhāvo mithyājñānaṃ tu tanmatam | tadeva karmaṇāṃ svasminkartavye sahakāraṇam |	On the other hand, if ignorance were to be admitted as false knowledge instead of absence of knowledge, then it turns into the co-cause of all actions one has to accomplish.
vaktavyaṃ tarhi kiṃ karma yadā sūte svakaṃ phalam | tadaiva mithyājñānena sadā hetutvamāpyate | atha yasminkṣaṇe karma kṛtaṃ tatra svarūpasat | mithyājñānaṃ yadi tatastādṛśātkarmaṇaḥ phalam |	Now the question concerns regarding the stage at which the causality of the faultiness of the knowledge involved in its accomplishment is understood. Is it at the time of enjoying or suffering its consequence or right at the time it was being created? In the case of admittance of the latter alternative, the fault would go to the action involved in the accomplishment.
prākpakṣe pralaye vṛtte prācyasṛṣṭipravartane| dehādyabhāvānno mithyājñānasya kvāpi saṃbhavaḥ |	- If we accept the prior position, there would be the problem of explaining the start of the new creation following the dissolution on account of total absence of body, etc. at this stage nullifying, thus, the role of the faulty knowledge in its accomplishment.
uttarasminpunaḥ pakṣe yadā yadyena yatra vā | kriyate karma tatsarvamajñānasacivaṃ tadā |	On acceptance of the latter position, on the other hand, when, where and by whom the action would have been done, they all would be treated as companions of the fault.
avaśyayamiti kasyāpi na karmaprakṣayo bhavet | yadyapi jñānavānbhūtvā vidhatte karma kiñcana | viphalaṃ syāttu tatpūrvakarmarāśau tu kā gatiḥ | atha pralayakāle'pi citsvabhāvatvayogataḥ | aṇūnāṃ saṃbhavatyeva jñānaṃ mithyeti tatkutaḥ | svabhāvāditi cenmukte śive vā kiṃ tathā na hi | yaccādarśanamākhyātaṃ nimittaṃ pariṇāmīni| pradhāne taddhi saṃkīrṇavaiviktyobhayayogataḥ |	In this latter event, no one would have the opportunity of getting rid of the responsibility of doing the action all by himself. -a In spite of being knowledgeable if someone fails to accomplish the task due to ordeal of the stock of impressions of his previous actions, what would be the remedy available to him? b-a If faulty knowledge may be possible naturally in liberated individuals in the state of dissolution why can it not be possible in Śiva also? b- Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... The lack of the power of sight that has been attributed to the prakrti which is the object of change is in the form of two causes, namely, narrowness and isolation.
darśanāya pumarthaikayogyatāsacivaṃ dhiyaḥ | ārabhya sūte dharaṇīparyantaṃ tatra yaccitaḥ | | buddhivṛttyaviśiṣṭatvaṃ puṃsprakāśaprasādataḥ | prakāśanāddhiyo'rthena saha bhogaḥ sa bhaṇyate |	So that the prakrti might show herself to the purusa and the latter might get redeemed, the prakrti manifests herself from mahat to the earth by getting reflected in it the light of the purusa in the form of intellect which is known as her purpose of the enjoyment.
buddhirevāsmi vikṛtidharmikānyastu ko'pyaso | madvilakṣaṇa ekātmetyevaṃ vaiviktyasaṃvidi |	- I am sheer intellect imbued with the attribute of change and who is there beside myself, these points of understanding are the cause of association of them with each other.
pumarthasya kṛtatvena sahakāriviyogataḥ | taṃ pumāṃsaṃ prati naiva sūte kiṃtvanyameva hi |	Both these purposes of them having been served through their association, now the prakrti ceases from producing anything in the interest of that particular purusa considering him as absolutely unattached with her.
atra puṃso'tha mūlasya dharmo'darśanatā dvayoḥ | athaveti vikalpo'yamāstāmetattu bhaṇyatām |	- Now, the question is raised from the side of the opponent which one from amongst the two, the prakrti or the purusa, is to be attributed with the disqualification of blindness or both of them together ? This needs to be explained.
bhogo vivekaparyanta iti yattatra ko'vadhiḥ | vivekalābhe nikhilasūtidṛgyadi sāpi kim | sāmānyena viśeṣairvā prācye syādekajanmataḥ | uttare na kadācitsyādbhāvikālasya yogataḥ | | kaiścideva viśeṣaiścetsarveṣāṃ yugapadbhavet | viveko'nādisaṃyogātkā hyanyonyaṃ vicitratā |	What is the length of the period of enjoyment prior to its end with the rising of discrimination ? On the rise of the power of discrimination, the problem is whether the insight of discrimination between the purusa and the prakrti arises only personally or collectively ? Is it concerned with only one life or all the previous lives? Is it likely to continue until all the future lives or would remain restricted only to the present life only all variations of time notwithstanding ? If discretion were to be born within all simultaneously due to presence of a certain peculiarity in the state of the contact between the Purusa and the Prakrti being eternal, what would be the difference between the state of bondage and redemption? Therefore the argument of indiscretion between the Prakrti and the Purusa as the cause of ignorance as per the Sānkhya logic itself does not fit well in this context.
tasmātsāṃkhyadṛśāpīdamajñānaṃ naiva yujyate | ajñānena vinā bandhamokṣau naiva vyavasthayā | | yujyete tacca kathitayuktibhirnopapadyate | māyākarmāṇudevecchāsadbhāve'pi sthite tataḥ | na bandhamokṣayoryogo bhedahetorasaṃbhavāt | tasmādajñānaśabdena jñatvakartṛtvadharmaṇām |	Without the concept of ignorance, ideas of bondage and redemption do not get justified while ignorance does not find justification neither in the unification of the Prakrti and the Purusa nor in their separation -a Since the Lord is absolutely transcendent to the phenomena of both bondage and liberation, He cannot be subjected to them in spite of the operation of the māyā and karma on Him. b-a Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... Therefore the word ajñāna, ignorance, needs to mean to wise people something like a coverture of individuals, atomic as they are being imbued with the attributes of knowership and action.
cidaṇūnāmāvaraṇaṃ kiñcidvācyaṃ vipaścitā | āvāraṇātmanā siddhaṃ tatsvarūpābhedavat | bhede pramāṇābhāvācca tadekaṃ nikhilātmasu | tacca kasmātprasūtaṃ syānmāyātaścetkathaṃ nu sā | kvacideva suvītaṃ tanna tu muktātmanītyayam | prācyaḥ paryanuyogaḥ syānnimittaṃ cenna labhyate |	b-a It is in terms of coverture that is understandable clearly the nature of ignorance in all its integrality as there is no scope for any division in it. b-a What is the source of this ignorance ? Is it māyā? If so, how is it that she is effective somewhere and not in the case of liberated individuals? b-a If its effectiveness is conceived in terms of some prior association, such an association is not available to any stretch of imagination .
utpattyabhāvatastena nityaṃ na ca vinaśyati | tata evaikatāyāṃ cānyātmasādhāraṇatvataḥ |	Indeed, it is due to absence of any point of its origin, it remains eternally constant.
na vāvastvarthakāritvānna cittatsaṃvṛtitvataḥ | na caitenātmanāṃ yogo hetumāṃstadasaṃbhavāt |	b- Ignorance cannot be dismissed as a non-entity as it is effective in action as well as in coverture of the consciousness. Still the problem remains in regard to its association with the self since there is no ground for this association.
tenaikaṃ vastu sannityaṃ nityasaṃbaddhamātmabhiḥ | jaḍaṃ malaṃ tadajñānaṃ saṃsārāṅkurakāraṇam |	Śrī Tantrāloka Therefore, ignorance would have to be admitted as one and the same principle associated always with the self known, however, differently as the inconscience, malady, ignorance and cause of the sprout of worldliness.
tasya rodhrī yadā śaktirudāste śivaraśmibhiḥ | tadāṇuḥ spṛśyate spṛṣṭaḥ svake jñānakriye sphuṭe | samāviśedayaṃ sūryakānto'rkeṇeva coditaḥ | roddhyāśca śaktermādhyasthyatāratamyavaśakramāt |	When the inhibitive power of ignorance would get the illumination of the rays of Śiva, the atomic centre of consciousness in the aspirant would manifest from it the forces of knowledge and action culminating in oneness with Him in the same way as the solar gem, sūryakānta mani, becomes as luminous as the sun on getting the contact of the latter's rays.
vicitratvamataḥ prāhurabhivyaktau svasaṃvidaḥ | sa eṣa śaktipātākhyaḥ śāstreṣu paribhāṣyate | |	-a wit Due to the rays of Siva falling on the inner being of the aspirant via the force of obstruction peculiar changes take place in the manifestation of the being. These changes in the psychic state are known in the śāstra as Sakti-pāta, descent of the spiritual force.
atrocyate malastāvadityameṣa na yujyate | iti pūrvāhnike proktaṃ punaruktau tu kiṃ phalam |	b- To delimit malady only to this much, is not proper. This has been discussed earlier in another chapter and, therefore, it would be fruitless to bring in the same here again.
malasya pākaḥ ko'yaṃ syānnāśaśceditarātmanām | sa eko mala ityukternairmalyamanuṣajyate |	Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... What is this maturation of the malady kind of? Does it imply elimination of all other obstructions? If this alone is considered as the malady creating obstruction between Siva-hood and the individual ignorance, elimination of it, would imply purification of all together.
atha pratyātmaniyato'nādiśca prāgabhāvavat | malo naśyettathāpyeṣa nāśo yadi sahetukaḥ |	If, on the other hand, the malady is taken to be confined to individuals as also beginningless, it also needs to get eliminated for all at one stroke the elimination being caused by its proper cause.
hetuḥ karmeśvarecchā vā karma tāvanna tādṛśam | īśvarecchā svatantrā ca kvacideva tathaiva kim |	If the cause of its elimination be determined as a certain action or wish of God, at least there is no such action in sight. So far as the effectiveness of the will of God in this regard is concerned, being autonomous, why should it be effective in a certain case and not in the rest.
ahetuko'sya nāśaścetprāgevaiṣa vinaśyatu | kṣaṇāntaraṃ sadṛk sūte iti cetsthirataiva sā |	- If the elimination of the malady be considered as having taken place without any cause behind it, it ought to have got eliminated previously as well, since its issuance of the same result even a moment subsequently would involve admittance of it as something durable.
na ca nityasya bhāvasya hetvanāyattajanmanaḥ | nāśo dṛṣṭaḥ prāgabhāvastvavastviti yathāstu saḥ | |	What is eternal and hence independent of any cause of its birth, does not meet end. So far as its prior elimination is concerned, this is absolutely a non-entity and hence it needs to be left to remain as such.
athāsya pāko nāmaiṣa svaśaktipratibaddhatā | sarvānprati tathaiṣa syādaruddhaśaktirviṣāgnivat |	Now, maturation of the force of malady may amount to stoppage of its effectiveness. If so, this nature of it ought to be applicable equally to all like the effect of poison and fire.
punarudbhūtaśaktau ca svakārya syādviṣāgnivat | muktā api na muktāḥ syuḥ śaktiṃ cāsya na manmahe | |	As regards the assumption of the revival of its effect, that has got to be taken as similar to that of poison and fire. As such, even those who are redeemed need not to be taken as redeemed.
rodhrīti cetkasya nṛṇāṃ jñatvakartṛtvayoryadi | sadbhāvamātrādroddhṛtve śivamuktāṇvasaṃbhavaḥ | |	If this power of obstruction be taken to be obstructive of the individual's power of knowledge and action, by virtue of its sheer presence, it would annul the very possibility of Śiva as well as of liberated individuals.
saṃnidhānātiriktaṃ ca kiñcitkurute malaḥ | ātmanāṃ pariṇāmitvādanityatvaprasaṅgataḥ | jñatvakartṛtvamātraṃ ca pudgalā na tadāśrayāḥ | taccedāvāritaṃ hanta rūpanāśaḥ prasajyate | āvaraṇaṃ cādṛśyatvaṃ na ca tadvastuno'nyatām | karoti ghaṭavajjñānaṃ nāvarītuṃ ca śakyate |	On the supposition that the malady may be effective in the absence of any contact, this would result in the admittance of the fact of becoming and perishability of the Selves which, indeed, is inadmissible. Individual Selves are not just resort of knowingness and activity since on obstruction of these inherent attributes of them, they would lose their being itself. Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... To cover anything amounts to render it invisible and by no means to make it look otherwise.
jñānenāvaraṇīyena tadevāvaraṇaṃ katham | na jñāyate tathā ca syādāvṛtirnāmamātrataḥ | roddhrayāśca śakte kastasya pratibandhaka īśvaraḥ | yadyapekṣāvirahitastatra prāgdattamuttaram |	However, covering of knowledge through ignorance is not akin to covering the jar by means of a piece of cloth. If knowledge were to cover anything, the same cover would become knowledgeable and the covering would become purely nominal. Who is the user of the power of obstruction? If he is God, does He use the power with some end in view or just aimlessly ? This question has already been answered.
karmasāmyamapekṣyātha tasyecchā saṃpravartate | tasyāpi rūpaṃ vaktavyaṃ samatā karmaṇāṃ hi kā | bhogaparyāyamāhātmyātkāle kvāpi phalaṃ prati | virodhātkarmaṇī ruddhe tiṣṭhataḥ sāmyamīdṛśam |	If he proceeds in the act of covering on the ground of some sort of akinness to anything, the shape of the model due to similarity with which the object in question is intended to be covered needs to be spelt out. It so happens in course of suffering or enjoying the result of one's actions that two actions of opposite nature get annulled amongst themselves. This is the case of similarity in this context.
taṃ ca kālāṃśaka devaḥ sarvajño vīkṣyaṃ taṃ malam | runddhe lakṣyaḥ sa kālaśca sukhaduḥkhādivarjanaiḥ |	The Lord has an eye on that malady and its timing and thus stops the incident of bearing the relevant fruit of both enjoyment and suffering.
naitatkramikasaṃśuddhavyāmiśrākārakarmabhiḥ | tathaiva deye svaphale keyamanyonyaroddhṛtā |	a This answer is not acceptable. There is a definite graduality in actions of pure nature, vicious or virtuous, and those of mixed character. The same graduality separates the fruition of the acts.
rodhe tayośca jātyāyurapi na syādataḥ patet | deho bhogadayoreva nirodha iti cennanu | jātyāyuṣpradakarmāṃśasaṃnidhau yadi śaṃkaraḥ| malaṃ runddhe bhogadātuḥ karmaṇaḥ kiṃ bibheti saḥ | śataśo'pi hlādatāpaśūnyāṃ saṃcinvate daśām | na ca bhaktirasāveśamiti bhūmnā vilokitam |	This being so, where is the scope for the fruits to inhibit each other? In the case of inhibition of the results of both these kinds of actions, the individual concerned is likely to die well before the decision regarding his age and caste. In such a case, what would happen to his soul in regard to his next birth ? Is Sankara afraid of the consequence of determination of his age and caste in his next birth and has kept the result reserved for the time being ? - It has been found in hundreds of cases of yogic practice that the practitioner coming to the state of nullity of the experience of exhilaration and suffering both but by no means one of getting absorbed in the delight of Śiva.
athāpi kālamāhātmyamapekṣya parameśvaraḥ | tathā karoti vaktavyaṃ kālo'sau kīdṛśastviti | kiṃ cānādirayaṃ bhogaḥ karmānādi sapudgalam | tataśca bhogaparyāyakālaḥ sarvasya niḥ samaḥ | |	If the answer to the above objection be that the Lord does so in view of the immensity of the glory of time, the question would be what is that time kind of which forces Him to do like that? Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... If the period of enjoyment of the result of past actions as well as the bodies of the enjoyers and their actions were to be regarded as beginningless as well as endless, that period would become available to all in common.
ādimattve hi kasyāpi vargādasmādbhavediyam | vaicitrī bhuktametena kalpametena tu dvayam |	Under this supposition what will happen in view of anyone from amongst these three factors of being limited to a beginning; that the particular individual would have enjoyed existence for one kalpa of time and the other for a couple of them and hence there would arise some sort of disparity of enjoyment.
iyato bhogaparyāyātsyātsāmyaṃ karmaṇāmiti | anena nayabījena manye vaicitryakāraṇam |	-a Under this presupposition, the peculiarity of the variety of action and result in the form of the look of the world would be lost.
jagataḥ karma yatklṛptaṃ tattathā nāvakalpate | anādimalasacchannāṃ aṇavo dṛkkriyātmanā | sarve tulyāḥ kathaṃ citrāṃ śritāḥ karmaparamparām | bhogalolikayā cetsā vicitreti kuto nanu |	b-a Then it would be difficult to explain how the individuals, irrespective of having been covered equally by the beginningless malady in regard to their power of understanding and action and hence having been equal in their respective statuses, have become peculiarly divergent in their actions. b-a Now if by way of solving this problem the role of the force of instability were to be adduced here, even then it would be difficult to account for the divergence in the quantum of pleasure and pain as met in the world.
anādikarmasaṃskāravaicitryāditi cetpunaḥ | vācyaṃ tadeva vaicitryaṃ kuto niyatirāgayoḥ |	If the divergence were to be explained in terms of impressions of actions of beginningless status, the question would shift to that new ground itself as to why of the divergence there also.
mahimā cedayaṃ tau kiṃ nāsamañjasyabhāginau | īśvarecchānapekṣā tu bhedaheturna kalpate | |	If answer be in terms of destiny and attachment, the question would be why to accuse them for these disparities. The will of God does not depend on anything.
athānāditvamātreṇa yuktihīnena sādhyate | vyavastheyamalaṃ tarhi malenāstu vṛthāmunā | |	Therefore, it cannot be held responsible for any kind of discrimination. b- Admittance of bare beginninglessness of the world's working as such is sufficient to counter all arguments against it.
tathā hi karma tāvanno yāvanmāyā na pudgale | vyāpriyeta na cāhetustavṛttistanmito malaḥ |	Therefore, there is no necessity of attributing the disparity of enjoyment and suffering in the world to any kind of malady. Until māyā engrosses the individual, there is no possibility of action on his part.
itthaṃ ca kalpite māyākārye karmaṇi hetutām anādi karma cedgacchetkiṃ malasyopakalpanam | nanu mābhūnmalastarhi citrākāreṣu karmasu | santatyāvartamāneṣu vyavasthā na prakalpate |	One cannot engage himself in action until he has some aspiration behind it. The relevance of malady lies in instigating him to get inclined to act as per the requirement of the occasion. On māyā being accepted as the beginningless cause of action, in this way, there is no necessity of bringing in anything like malady in this regard.
adau madhye ca citratvātkarmaṇāṃ na yathā samaḥ | ātmākāro'pi ko'pyeṣa bhāvikāle tathā bhavet | itthamucchinna evāeṃ bandhamokṣādikaḥ kramaḥ | ajñānādbandhanaṃ mokṣo jñānāditi parīkṣitam |	Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... If the law of action does not remain the same from the beginning to the midway owing to its peculiarity, what is the guarantee for its remaining the same in future also in the form of the self as well ? On admittance of irregularity in the law of action, the entire law of causality in regard to bondage and liberation would also have to collapse while the fact has been settled that ignorance leads to bondage and knowledge to liberation.
virodhe svaphale caite karmaṇī samaye kvacit | udāsāte yadi tataḥ karmaitatpratibudhyatām |	When there be a case of two sorts of action of opposite nature annulling the effect of each other, there needs to be brought in a third action as the remedy of the opposition.
śivaśaktinipātasya ko'vakāśastu tāvatā | kvāpi kāle tayoretadaudāsīnyaṃ yadā tataḥ | kālāntare tayostadvadvirodhasyānivṛttitaḥ | ataśca na phaletānte tābhyāṃ karmāntarāṇi ca | ruddhāni prāptakālatvādgatābhyāmupabhogyatām | evaṃ sadaiva vārtāyāṃ dehapāte tathaiva ca | |	Where then is any scope for bringing in anything like Siva and Sakti as the solution ? -a In case of barrenness in the yield of the fruit of a set of two actions of opposite nature, and continuance of the same state in case of other actions also there is the danger of continuing the same state of fruitlessness in future also until at last the moment of death of the individual may come and yet the same state of tug- of-war may be remaining continued resulting in the liberation of the individual Śrī Tantrāloka leaving behind, thus, rendering all the principle of descent of force into a matter of sheer imagination.
athodāsīnatatkarmadvayayogakṣaṇāntare | karmāntaraṃ phalaṃ sūte tatkṣaṇe'pi tathā na kim | kṣaṇāntare'tha te eva pratibandhavivarjite | | phalataḥ pratibandhasya varjanaṃ kiṃkṛtaṃ tayoḥ | karmasāmyaṃ svarūpeṇa na ca tattāratamyabhāk |	b-a Now the question is that if any action other than these two may bear fruit meanwhile in the state of tug-of-war between these two, why anyone else may not do the same? b-a If perchance those two actions get redeemed of the curse of fruitlessness owing to removal of the obstruction, what will happen to the bar on their fruition? b-a Homogeneity in action arises out of the nature of the action itself and is not subjected to graduality.
na śiveccheti tatkārye śaktipāte na tadbhavet | tirobhāvaśca nāmāyaṃ sa kasmādudbhavetpunaḥ |	b-a What may serve as the cause of the stoppage of the descent? Homogeneity of action cannot be effective in this regard since what it had to do, has already been accomplished.
karmasāmyena yatkṛtyaṃ prāgevetatkṛtaṃ kila | hetutve ceśvarecchāyā vācyaṃ pūrvavadeva tu | |	So far as the causality of the wish of the Lord in the regard is concerned, this aspect of His role is sure to remain the same as earlier. b- Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness...
etenānye'pi ye'pekṣyā īśecchāyāṃ prakalpitā | dhvastāste'pi hi nityānyahetvahetvādidūṣaṇāt |	In this way, any number of other probabilities conceived in regard to the will of the Lord, such as whether the will of Him is eternal or ephemeral, cause or not, etc. get cancelled on account of their attribution of any evil design to Him.
vairāgyaṃ bhogavairasyaṃ dharmaḥ ko'pi vivekitā | satsaṅgaḥ parameśānapūjādyabhyāsanityatā | āpatprāptistannirīkṣā dehe bhogasaṃghapūrṇatā jñānamaiśvaram | ityapekṣyaṃ yadīśasya dūṣyametacca pūrvavat | vyabhicāraśca sāmastyavyastatvābhyāṃ svarūpataḥ |	Those who claim that the Lord makes the force descend on account of practice of renunciation, detachment from enjoyment, acquisition of righteousness, power of discretion, practice of association with noble persons and noble ideas, worship of the Lord, continuity of practice, being encircled by dangers, anticipation of danger, appearance of the symptom of some such danger on the body, service of the Sāstra, completion of the quantum of enjoyment as well as suffering, knowledge and period of glory, all such imputations of motive to Him need to be dismissed as has been done already.
anyonyānupraveśaścānupapattiśca bhūyaso | tasmānna manmahe ko'yaṃ śaktipātavidheḥ kramaḥ | |	These imputations levelled against Him suffer from a large number of defects such as intermixture, collectivity, severalty, commonality besides irrationality. Therefore, I fail to understand what this mode of descent of force is.
itthaṃ bhrāntiviṣāveśamūrcchānirmokadāyinīm | śrīśaṃbhuvadanodgorṇāṃ vacmyāgamamahauṣadhīm |	- Under all this travesty of understanding about the descent of force, I cannot but take resort to what has come out of the mouth of my teacher Sambhunatha as the glorious medicine capable of serving as a remedy against the poison generative of delusion and swoon.
devaḥ svatantraścidrūpaḥ prakāśātmā svabhāvataḥ | rūpapracchādanakrīḍā yogādaṇuranekakaḥ |	The Lord is autonomous, pure consciousness, of the nature of illumination and capable of concealing Himself sportively and reappearing in the form of innumerable atomic individuals.
sa svayaṃ kalpitākāravikalpātmakakarmabhiḥ | badhnātyātmānameveha svātantryāditi varṇitam |	By means of His own action of assuming all possible alternative forms, He binds Himself by virtue of His autonomy. All this has been made out already in different chapters of this work.
svātantryamahimaivāyaṃ devasya yadasau punaḥ | svaṃ rūpaṃ pariśuddhaṃ satspṛśatyapyaṇutāmayaḥ |	Herein, indeed, lies the greatness of His autonomy that besides assuming the atomic forms, He again comes to Himself encompassing all atomic forms well within Himself in all their purity as inherent in Him.
na vācyaṃ tu kathaṃ nāma kasmiṃścitpuṃsyasau tathā | nahi nāma pumānkaścidyasminparyanuyujyate |	Here in this system there is no necessity of any other Person accomplishing the task of liberating the individuals from the shackle of bondage whomsoever He chooses.
deva eva tathāsau cet svarūpaṃ cāsya tādṛśam | tādṛkprathāsvabhāvasya svabhāve kānuyojyatā |	If the Lord Himself be capable of accomplishing all this and of that aptitude, there is no necessity of bringing in anyone else as the motivator of Him in this task.
āhāsmatparameṣṭhī ca śivadṛṣṭau gurūttamaḥ | pañcaprakārakṛtyoktiśivatvānnijakarmaṇe | pravṛttasya nimittānāmapareṣāṃ kva mārgaṇam | channasvarūpatābhāse puṃsi yadyādṛśaṃ phalam |	The most revered teacher of our teacher Somānanda has stated in the Siva- drsti that in the state of five forms of accomplishments of Śiva as stated therein creation, sustenance, dissolution, concealment and benediction of grace , where is the necessity of ascribing to Him any other motive or a group of motives? -a In spite of the individual's real nature having been concealed, the autonomy of his activeness remains intact.
tatrāṇoḥ sata evāsti svātantryaṃ karmato hi tat | īśvarasya ca yā svātmatirodhitsā nimittatām | sābhyeti karmamalayorato'nādivyavasthitiḥ | tirodhiḥ pūrṇarūpasyāpūrṇatvaṃ tacca pūraṇam |	This autonomy of action remains so for the sake of his remaining active all through. b-a Indeed, it is the will of the Lord to conceal Himself which becoming operative serves as the fundamental cause of accumulation of the impression of action as well as formation of the malady of action in the individual's inner being of the status of beginninglessness.
prati bhinnena bhāvena spṛhāto lolikā malaḥ | viśuddhasvaprakāśātmaśivarūpatayā vinā |	b-a Imperfection of the Perfect is, indeed, His desire for self-concealment. It is due to being associated with this desire of Him, that the force of instability becomes a malady.
na kiṃcidyujyate tena heturatra maheśvaraḥ | itthaṃ sṛṣṭisthitidhvaṃsatraye māyāmapekṣate | kṛtyai malaṃ tathā karma śivecchaiveti susthitam | yattu kasmiṃścana śivaḥ svena rūpeṇa bhāsate |	b-a Since anything like this cannot happen without the imperative of Śiva as pure self-illumination, therefore, He needs to be regarded as the cause of all this. b-a In this way, in all these three acts of Him, that is, creation, sustenance and dissolution, He needs the help of māyā. It is His requirement of māyā in carrying out His desire for self-concealment and atomisation which results in turning the process and the action into a malady in spite of the involvement of the will of Siva Himself behind it.
tatrāsya nāṇuno tāvadapekṣye malakarmaṇī | aṇusvarūpatāhānau tadgataṃ hetutāṃ katham | |	In the absence of the very cause of individuality, how can the latter remain in him? So is to be understood the case of māyā also.
vrajenmāyānapekṣatvamata evopapādayet | tena śuddhaḥ svaprakāśa śiva evātra kāraṇam |	Therefore, it is the self-luminous Śiva who serves as the cause of the descent of the force. It is sheer His autonomy which serves as the cause of the manifestation of the homogeneity in the case leading to the descent of the force.

Distinct from it is the case of those who cherish devotion to Him for gaining a certain objective. That is not applicable to aspirants of redemption.
prāgbhāge'pekṣate karma citratvānnottare punaḥ | anābhāsitarūpo'pi tadābhāsitayeva yat |	In regard to the dual objective of enjoyment and liberation both, the fact is that while enjoyment may need performance of righteous action due to specification in the quantum of enjoyment but liberation does not require anything like this.
sthitvā mantrādi saṃgṛhya tyajetso'sya tirobhavaḥ | śrīsāraśāstre bhagavānvastvetatsamabhāṣata |	b-a That individual is taken to be a deserter, tirobhava, who in the absence of any reflection of Siva-hood in him poses as if he is imbued with that reflection and thus after getting the mantra, etc.
dharmādharmātmakairbhāvairanekairveṣṭayetsvayam | asandehaṃ svamātmānamavīcyādiśivāntake | |	b-a In the Sāra śāstra, Lord Śiva Himself has observed about it as follows: The individual is at liberty to enclose himself with virtuous or vicious notions as he chooses resulting in his landing himself to any state of being from the lowest avici state of hell to the highest state of Śiva-hood.
tadvacchaktisamūhena sa eva tu viveṣṭayet | svayaṃ badhnāti deveśaḥ svayaṃ caiva vimuñcati |	Indeed, it is Śiva Himself who binds Himself by means of the concerned group of forces as well as liberates Himself.
svayaṃ bhoktā svayaṃ jñātā svayaṃ caivopalakṣayet | svayaṃ bhuktiśca muktiśca svayaṃ devī svayaṃ prabhuḥ |	He Himself is the enjoyer as well as the knower, enjoyment as well as the state of liberation, the Goddess as well as the Lord.
svayamekākṣarā caiva yathoṣmā kṛṣṇavartmanaḥ | vastūktamatra svātantryātsvātmarūpaprakāśanam | |	He alone is the state of immortality represented by the unique syllable Om like heat inherent in Śrī Tantrāloka fire. Bondage and liberation as two ends of the reality are His modes of self- manifestation.
śrīmannikule'pyuktaṃ mithyābhāvitacetasaḥ | malamāyāvicāreṇa kliśyante svalpabuddhayaḥ |	b- It has been observed in the Nisakula śāstra also that those who entertain wrong notions, suffer from malice and delusion and hence are unwise.
sphaṭikopalago reṇuḥ kiṃ tasya kurutāṃ priye | vyomnīva nīlaṃ hi malaṃ malaśaṃkāṃ tatastyajet |	O Dear Parvati, what can a particle of dust falling on a piece of crystal or the sense of blueness attached to space do to it? What one needs to do is to get rid of the doubt of the malady.
śrīmānvidyāguruścāha pramāṇastutidarśane | dharmādharmavyāptivināśāntarakāle śakteḥ pāto gāhanikairyaḥ pratipannaḥ | taṃ svecchātaḥ saṃgiramāṇā stavakādyā svātantryaṃ tattvayyanapekṣaṃ kathayeyuḥ | tāratamyaprakāśo yastīvramadhyamamandatāḥ | tā eva śaktipātasya pratyeka traimāsthitāḥ | tīvratīvraḥ śaktipāto dehapātavaśātsvayam |	- My teacher of wisdom, vidyā-guru, has written in the Pramāna-Stuti Darśana as follows: “The propounders of the doctrine of illusion conceive of the descent of force as a result of automatic stimulation independent of the will of the Lord during the interval of the period of prevalence of righteousness and end with that of unrighteousness and vice versa.” The light of homogeneity of descent of the force has been considered as consolidated each in a threefold mode, namely, intensive, middling and mild and the same again getting divided into three with the mutual intermixture of these states. -a Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness...
mokṣapradastadaivānyakāle vā tāratamyataḥ | madhyatīvrātpunaḥ sarvamajñānaṃ vinivartate |	The intensified state of the intensive kind of descent of force results in the fall of the body followed by liberation while the same in its middling state brings in homogeneity resulting in the removal of ignorance in entirety.
svayameva yato vetti bandhamokṣatayātmatām | tatprātibhaṃ mahājñānaṃ śāstrācāryānapekṣi yat |	Owing to this state of removal of ignorance the individual is enabled to understand by himself his states of bondage and liberation. This great knowledge in its intuitive wake does not require help of anyone conversant with the śāstra.
pratibhācandrikāśāntadhvāntaścācāryacandramāḥ| tamastāpau hanti dṛśaṃ visphāryānandanirbharām |	b- The teacher as the moon removes the entire darkness of ignorance of the disciple by means of the rays of his intuitive knowledge and brings to an end his ignorance as well as suffering and makes him look at that teacher with wide open eyes delightfully and surprisingly.
saṃśiṣṭa karmakartṛtvācchiṣyo'nyaḥ karmabhāvataḥ | śiṣṭaḥ sarvatra ca smārtapadakālakulādiṣu |	The sista is considered everywhere be it the context of his knowledge of the smrtis, time inborn talent in the understanding of the meaning of the texts. The denomination of samsita implies doership of the act of learning while sisya his role as the object of the act of the same act.
uktaḥ svayaṃbhūḥ śāstrārthapratibhāpariniṣṭhitaḥ| yanmūlaṃ śāsanaṃ tena na riktaḥ ko'pi jantukaḥ | tatrāpi tāratamyotthamānantyaṃ dāḍharyakamprate | yuktiḥ śāstraṃ gururvādo'bhyāsa ityādyapekṣate | |	So far as the fundamental act of learning is concerned, no living being is completely bereft of it. - Sri Tantrāloka In spite of sharing in that talent in common with all living beings, however, there are grades in the magnitude of the capacity of learning with respect to steadiness as well as frequency of vibration. To remain up to the mark the learner needs to exercise his reasoning, conversance with the texts, guidance from the suitable teacher, discussion and constancy of practice, etc.
kampamānaṃ hi vijñānaṃ svayameva punarvrajet | kasyāpi dārḍhyamanyasya yuktyādyaiḥ kevaletaraiḥ |	The unsteadiness in the acquisition of knowledge may get gradually consolidated into steadiness automatically in a certain instance while in other cases it may require recourse to certain devices.
yathā yathā parāpekṣātānavaṃ prātibhe bhavet | tathā tathā gururasau śreṣṭho vijñānapāragaḥ | anyataḥ śikṣitānantajñāno'pi pratibhābalāt | yadvetti tatra tatrāsya śivatā jyāyasī ca sā | |	Inasmuch as the teacher strives to develop the capacity of intuitive learning in the student gradually, his excellence as the teacher and competence in the discipline goes on increasing. In spite of having acquired his fund of knowledge in all its profundity from elsewhere, whatever he comes to understand through his intuitive power, adds to his credit of excellence in Siva-hood.
na cāsya samayitvādikramo nāpyabhiṣecanam | na santānādi no vidyāvrataṃ prātibhavartmanaḥ |	A teacher who is imbued with the power of intuition is not required to observe the conventional rules laid down in regard to the discipline concerned including bathing, progeny, etc.
ādividvānmahādevastenaiṣo'dhiṣṭhito yataḥ | saṃskārāstadadhiṣṭhānasiddhyai tattasya tu svataḥ | devībhirdīkṣitastena sabhaktiḥ śivaśāsane | dṛḍhatākampratābhedaiḥ so'pi svayamatha vratāt | tapojapādergurutaḥ svasaṃskāraṃ prakalpayet | yato vājasanīyākhya ukta siñcetsvayaṃ tanum | |	as he has become possessed by Śiva Himself who is the root cause of all knowledge whatever all kinds of sanskāras, impressions of nobility, being meant for the same possession by Him. - Along with the variation in the degree of his solidity and quantum of vibration in him, he, too, is capable of becoming a teacher of his own sort through the observance of austerity, japa and help of a certain teacher as assisted in the modification of his samskāras, impressions As has been stated in the text Vajasániya, beginning from the suggestion that he should drench his body until he gets established in the stream of the system and thus he would come to be regarded as initiated, abhisikta, even without any use of the water of the jar from outside.
śrīsarvavīraśrībrahmayāmalādau ca tattathā | nirūpitaṃ maheśena kiyadvā likhyatāmidam | |	- The same view of initiation of the kind has been expressed in texts like Sarvavira and Brahmayāmala, etc. by the great Lord Himself, needing no more to elaborate on it.
itthaṃ prātibhavijñānaṃ kiṃ kiṃ kasya na sādhayet | yatprātibhādvā sarvaṃ cetyūce śeṣamahāmuniḥ | |	In this way, does there remain anything which may not be availed of by means of the intuitive knowledge ? This has been claimed by Patañjali in his Yoga Sutra through his observation prātibhādvā sarvam.
anye tvāhurakāmasya prātibho gururīdṛśaḥ | sāmagrījanyatā kāmye tenāsminsaṃskṛto guru |	For the sake of this latter kind of students, only that teacher is suitable who has become a teacher by virtue of observance of traditionally approved rites.
niyatermahimā naiva phale sādhye nivartate | abhiṣiktaścīrṇavidyāvratastena phalapradaḥ |	This is the grand law of Nature that it does not stop its operation until the result of the action has been produced. Accordingly, it is only that teacher who proves to be fruitful who has observed all the preconditions necessary for acquisition of the wisdom.
asadetaditi prāhurguravastattvadarśinaḥ | śrīsomānandakalyāṇabhavabhūtipurogamā |	- Our teachers like Somānanda, Kalyāna and Bhavabhūti and others who went into the essentials of things, have characterised this viewpoint as untenable.
tathā hi trīśikāśāstravivṛtau te'bhyadadhurbudhāḥ | sāṃsiddhikaṃ yadvijñānaṃ taccintāratnamucyate | tadabhāve tadartha tadāhṛtaṃ jñānamādṛtam | evaṃ yo veda tattvena tasya nirvāṇagāminī | |	This is obvious from their mention as such in the Trisikā śāstra-Vivrti -a The established knowledge available via intuition is the gem of ideation. In the absence of such a precious element in knowledge, all other kinds of knowledge would fall short of achieving their goal, since their respectability rests in scoring that goal. b-a Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness...
dīkṣā bhavatyasandigdhā tilājyāhutivarjitā | adṛṣṭamaṇḍalo'pyevaṃ yaḥ kaścidvetti tattvataḥ | sa siddhibhāgbhavennityaṃ sa yogī sa ca dīkṣitaḥ | avidhijño vidhānajño jāyate yajanaṃ prati | |	He who understands this in its essence, his initiation leads him undoubtedly to liberation without the offering of the oblation of sesumum indicum and purified butter. He who knows this, without having ever come across a mandala, becomes accomplished, a yogin and really initiated. He is regarded as conversant with all the rules of sacrifice even without having understood anything of them.
ityādibhistrīśikoktervākyairmāheśvaraiḥ sphuṭam jñānaṃ dīkṣādisaṃskārasatattavamiti varṇitam |	All this has been made obvious by statements of the Lord Himself in the Trisikā Sāstra concerning knowledge, initiation and the reality.
jñānopāyastu dīkṣādikriyā jñānaviyoginām | ityetadadhunaivāstāṃ svaprastāve bhaviṣyati | |	b- Methods of acquisition of knowledge and initiation, etc., are useful only for him who is shorn of knowledge. As such, let us stop with discussion on it right now to be taken up in its proper context subsequently.
gurūśāstrapramāṇāderapyupāyatvamañjasā | pratibhā paramevaiṣā sarvakāmadudhā yataḥ |	Though teacher and śāstras, etc., have their own importance in the context of acquisition of knowledge quickly yet intuition is the supreme amongst all of them as it is the fulfiller of all aspirations in that regard.
upāyayogakramato nirupāyamathākramam | yadrūpaṃ tatparaṃ tattvaṃ tatra tatra suniścitam | yastu prātibhabāhyātmasaṃskāradvayasundaraḥ | ukto'nanyopakāryatvātsa sākṣādvarado gurūḥ |	From amidst the two ways of acquisition of right knowledge, that is, methodical and unmethodical, it is the latter which leads to the highest goal, this has been established in proper contexts as per the occasion. That teacher is highly beneficial who is equipped with power of intuition as well as self-culture acquired through effort since both these attributes are complementary of each other.
svamuktimātre kasyāpi yāvadviśvavimocane | pratibhodeti khadyotaratnatārendusūryavat |	If someone happens to develop the power of liberating the entire world by way of his effort to liberate himself, that would be like a firefly, gem, star or moon becoming as luminous as the sun.
tataḥ prātibhasaṃvittyai śāstramasmatkṛtaṃ tvidam | yo'bhyasyetsa gururnaiva vastvarthā hi viḍambakāḥ |	It is with the view of developing the genius of the teacher and the taught to this extent that we have authored this Sāstra. He who would aim at this objective, would be the teacher in the real sense of the term leaving behind the rest as mimickers.
paropajīvitā buddhyā sarvaṃ itthaṃ na bhāsate | taduktyā na vinā vetti śaktipātasya māndyataḥ |	Due to dependence on the guidance of others, people generally do not manifest the power of intuition inherent in them and do not know the reality without the help of them owing to mildness of the descent of force on them.
sphuṭametacca śāstreṣu teṣu teṣu nirūpyate | kiraṇāyāṃ tathoktaṃ ca gurutaḥ śāstrataḥ svataḥ |	In the Kirana Sāstra it has been stated that some people get enlightenment from the teacher, some from the śāstra while a few develop it from within themselves while the rest get insight through action.
jñānayogyāstathā keciccaryāyogyāstathāpare | śrīmannandiśikhātantre vitatyaitannirūpitam |	Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... Some of the students become qualified through knowledge while some of them through action.
praśnottaramukheneti tadabhagnaṃ nirūpyate | anirdeśya śivastatra ko'bhyupāyo nirūpyatām | iti praśne kṛte devyā śrīmāñchambhurnyarūpayat | upāyo'tra vivekaikaḥ sa hi heyaṃ vihāpayan | |	In the Nandisikhā Tantra this has been elucidated in detail through a dialogue which is being presented here. Since Śiva lies beyond indication, how can He be elucidated? Having been enquired like this by the Goddess, Sambhu replied as follows: -a There is only one means of getting rid of what is worth being free of and evolving the intuitive knowledge, O Dear.
dadātyasya ca suśroṇi prātibhaṃ jñānamuttamam | yadā pratibhayā yuktastadā muktaśca mocayet | paraśaktinipātena dhvastamāyāmalaḥ pumān | nanu prāgdīkṣayā mokṣo'dhunā tu prātibhātkatham |	b-a When anyone becomes furnished with intuitive knowledge, he not only becomes redeemed himself having got free of the malady of māyā by virtue of descent of the force but also may liberate others. b-a Now the question is as follows: While previously it was stated that liberation may be attained through initiation but now it is being said that the same may be available by means of intuitive knowledge.
iti devyā kṛte praśne prāvartata vibhorvacaḥ | dīkṣayā mucyate jantuḥ prātibhena tathā priye | | gurvāyattā tu sā dīkṣā badhyabandhanamokṣaṇe | prātibho'sya svabhāvastu kevalībhāvasiddhidaḥ | kevalasya dhruvaṃ muktiḥ paratattvena sā nanu | nṛktiśivamuktaṃ hi tattvatrayamidaṃ tvayā |	Why is it so? Having been questioned like this, the Lord responded as follows: 'One gets liberated via initiation as well as intuitive knowledge, O Dear!' b- “The difference between the two means of redemption, however, is that while redemption of the disciple through the teacher involves dependence on him, intuitive knowledge as the cause of bondage and liberation both has to be revealed from within the aspirant himself as his inmost nature in the form of his aloneness.' In response to this answer of Śiva, the Goddess asks as follows : 'Now the problem is that while liberation through aloneness has certainty about it on account of the involvement of the Supreme Reality in it, the same is not the case with it because of its dependence on as many as three agencies, namely, the individual, the Force and Siva.' The fact in this regard is that there is involvement of three factors, the individual, the Force and Siva.
no bandhyo bandhane śakti karaṇaṃ kartṛtāṃ spṛśat | śivaḥ karteti tatproktaṃ sarva gurvāgamādaṇoḥ |	From amongst them, the individual is subject to bondage, the Force is the means of bondage while Siva is the agent of bondage. Sources of this wisdom are the teacher, the text and the individual's intuition.
punarvivekāduktaṃ taduttarottaramucyatām | kathaṃ vivekaḥ kiṃ vāsya devadeva vivicyate |	'Please tell me, O Lord, how discretion works in this respect.' - Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness...
ityukte parameśānyā jagādādiguruḥ śivaḥ | śivāditattvatritayaṃ tadāgamavaśādguroḥ | | adharottaragairvākyaiḥ siddhaṃ prātibhatāṃ vrajet | dīkṣāsicchinnapāśatvādbhavanābhāvitasya hi | vikāsaṃ tattvamāyāti prātibhaṃ tadudāhṛtam | bhasmacchannāgnivatsphauṭyaṃ prātibhe gauravāgamāt |	Having been enquired like this by the Goddess, Śiva, as the primeval teacher, replies as follows: ‘Out of the factors Śiva and the text, the aspirant needs to learn through the device of questions and answer the secret of the intuitive wisdom and examine its pros and cons in the light of the intuitive wisdom and thus may become accomplished in that wisdom.' -a Intuitive knowledge is that which evolves by virtue of having been cut asunder the bondage through the sword of initiation and contemplation on the instruction of the text.
bījaṃ kālopsaṃsiktaṃ yathā vardheta tattathā | yogayāgajapairuktairguruṇā prātibhaṃ sphuṭet | |	b-a The intuitive knowledge is likely to sprout in all its glory like the seed sown at the right time drenched with water frequently and brightened in its splendour like a firebrand covered with a layer of ash having been removed through the practice of yoga, sacrifice, japa and instruction of the teacher.
viveko'tīndriyastveṣa yadāyāti vivecanam | paśupāśapatijñānaṃ svayaṃ nirbhāsate tadā | prātibhe tu samāyāte jñānamanyattu sendriyam | vāgakṣiśrutigamyaṃ cāpyanyāpekṣaṃ varānane | tattyajedbuddhimāsthāya pradīpaṃ tu yathā divā |	Being subjected to discrimination, it develops in the form of the wisdom of the individual, the bondage, the Lord and the knowledge for the redemption automatically. On sprouting of the intuitive wisdom from this background, it gets manifested via the channels of speech, sight and the auditory organ and whatever is dependent on them, O Beautiful Lady ! Taking recourse to the higher wisdom, the aspirant needs to liberate himself from these fascinations like one blowing out the flame of the lamp on the advent of the daylight.
dūrācchratyādivedhādivṛddhikrīḍāvicitritā | sarvabhāvavivekāttu sarvabhāvaparāṅmukhaḥ | | krīḍāsu suviraktātmā śivabhāvaikabhāvitaḥ | māhātmyametatsuśroṇi prātibhasya vidhīyate | | svacchāyādarśavatpaśyedbahirantargataṃ śivam | heyopādeyatattvajñastadā dhyāyennijāṃ citim |	-a The practitioner, in whom the power of discretion has developed, may perceive through consciousness sounds from far afar, direct his consciousness on the right target, grow himself extraordinarily and thus display peculiar feats in several ways. b-a Such a practitioner becomes indifferent to all sorts of allurements out of his exercise of discretion towards everything whatever as also owing to having become possessed of the sense of Siva-hood. So much has been laid down in the texts, regarding his power, O Beautiful Lady, as to be capable of envisioning Siva inside as well as outside like one seeing one's reflection in a mirror.
siddhijālaṃ hi kathitaṃ parapratyayakāraṇam | ihaiva siddhāḥ kāyānte mucyeranniti bhāvanāt |	Whatever has been said in praise of siddhis, accomplishment of extraordinary powers is meant only for winning over the confidence of the people in the Ultimate Being amounting to convincing them that through faith in Him alone they can get liberated.
parabhāvanadārḍhyāttu jīvanmukto nigadyate | etatte prātibhe bhede lakṣaṇaṃ samudāhṛtam |	b- Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... It is through contemplation on Him that one has the possibility of getting redeemed.
śāpānugrahakāryeṣu tathābhyāsena śaktatā| teṣūdāsīnatāyāṃ tu mucyate mocayetparān |	While practice for the capability of being effective in cursing as well as benediction the practitioner, indifferent towards such powers makes use of them to liberate himself as well as others.
bhūtendriyādiyogena baddho'ṇuḥ saṃsareddhruvam | sa eva pratibhāyukta śaktitattvaṃ nigadyate | tatpātāveśato muktaḥ śiva eva bhavārṇavāt | nanvācāryātsendriyaṃ tajjñānamuktamatīndriyam | vivekajaṃ ca tadbuddhayā tatkathaṃ syānnirindriyam | iti pṛṣṭho'bhyadhātsvāntadhiyorjāḍyekavāsanāt |	Owing to contact between the physical elements and the senses the individual is sure to remain wandering in the world while having got imbued with the power of intuition, which is known as Śakti, Force, he has the prospect of getting the Force descend on him culminating ultimately in his assimilation into Siva and crossing the ocean of the world. -a The Goddess asks Him again as follows: ‘My Lord you have characterised the knowledge as acquired from the teacher as sensory while the same as born of the power of discretion as extra-sensory.
akṣatvaṃ pravivekena tacchittau bhāsakaḥ śivaḥ | saṃskāraḥ sarvabhāvānāṃ paratā parikīrtitā |	As distinct from it the wisdom born of intuition eliminates the inanimateness of it followed by submission of it to the illumination of Siva. Limited luminosity is the characteristic feature of the inanimate.
manobuddhī na bhinne tu kasmiṃścitkāraṇāntare | viveke kāraṇe hote prabhuśaktyupabṛṃhite |	b- Manas and intellect, indeed, are not different in their basic character unless they get mixed up with a cause of an entirely of different nature.
na manobuddhihīnastu jñānasyādhigamaḥ priye| parabhāvāttu tatsūkṣmaṃ śaktittvaṃ nigadyate |	Without coordination of the manas and the intellect, there is little possibility of acquisition of knowledge, O Dear! They assume the subtle form of śakti through the penetration of it into them.
vivekaḥ sarvabhāvānāṃ śuddhabhāvānmahāśayaḥ | buddhitattvaṃ tu triguṇamuttamādhamamadhyamam |	Discretion bears with it the sense of nobility by virtue of being purificatory of all the ideas while intellect being of triple nature, namely, the highest, middling and lowest, as well as on account of being accompanied by the extraordinary powers like animā, etc.
aṇimādigataṃ cāpi bandhakaṃ jaḍamindriyam| nanu prātibhato muktau dīkṣayā kiṃ śivādhvare |	is binding, inanimate and sensory. -a ‘What is the utility of initiation into the system and practice of Śaivism when liberation is attainable via intuition itself?' asks the Goddess.
ūce'jñānā hi dīkṣāyāṃ bālabāliśayoṣitaḥ| pāśacchedādvimucyante prabuddhyante śivādhvare |	The Lord replies as follows in response to this query I have to say that initiation is a necessity particularly for the sake of children, childish and women who get redeemed through it from the shackle of worldliness and get awakened on the path of Siva-hood.
tasmāddīkṣā bhavatyeṣu kāraṇatvena sundara | dīkṣayā pāśamokṣe tu śuddhabhāvādvivekajam |	Thus, it serves as the means of liberation of them. By virtue of initiation they get redeemed of the shackle having the possibility of getting purified in their ideation as born of discretion.
ityeṣa paṭhito grantha svayaṃ ye bodhumakṣamāḥ | teṣāṃ śivoktisaṃvādādbodho dāḍharyaṃ vrajediti | śrīmanniśāṭane cātmaguruśāstravaśāstridhā| jñānaṃ mukhyaṃ svopalabdhi vikalpārṇavatāraṇam |	- Even though having read the text those who are incapable of understanding its sense, for them the dialogue between Siva and the Goddess may bring clarity to their understanding. In the text Nisātana, it has been observed that out of the three sources of knowledge, namely, self, teacher and the śāstra, it is the knowledge evolved from within oneself which is foremost and is capable of taking one across the sea of options.
mantrātmabhūtadravyāṃśadivyatattvādigocarā | śaṅkā vikalpamūlā hi śāmyetsvapratyayāditi |	Mantra, self, elements, materials, divinity and essence all these six are the alternative sources of knowledge which get reconciled ultimately into the self- knowledge.
ainamevārthamantaḥsthaṃ gṛhītvā mālinīmate | evamasyātmanaḥ kāle kasmiṃścidyogyatāvaśāt | śaivī saṃbadhyate śaktiḥ śāntā muktiphalapradā| tatsaṃbandhāttataḥ kaścittatkṣaṇādapavṛjyate | |	Sri Tantrāloka According to Mālinivijayottara Tantra, the aspirant needs to internalise whatever information and insight is available through these sources and wait for that opportune moment when as per his worth Siva's Force named śāntā would descend on him and would prove liberating via his assimilation into Siva.
ityuktvā tīvratīvrākhyāviṣayaṃ bhāṣate punaḥ | ajñānena sahaikatvaṃ kasyacidvinivartate |	Having said this much on the topic, Siva moves on to the topic of intensively intensive form of the descent of the force in the case of some rare one whose ignorance gets removed via it.
rudraśaktisamāviṣṭaḥ sa yiyāsuḥ śivecchayā | bhuktimukti prasiddhayarthaṃ nīyate sadguruṃ prati | tamārādhya tatastuṣṭāddīkṣāmāsādya śāṅkarīm | tatkṣaṇādvopabhogādvā dehapātācchivaṃ vrajet |	Being possessed by the force of Rudra, the aspirant of liberation surrenders himself to the will of Śiva and happens to be brought to the proximity of the teacher for the sake of fulfilment of his aspiration for liberation as well as desire for enjoying the course of life. Due to having placed Himself at the disposal of the teacher, and thus having satisfied him by his service to him, the aspirant gets initiated by him to the discipline of Sankara.
asyārtha ātmanaḥ kācitkalanāmarśanātmikā| svaṃ rūpaṃ prati yā saiva ko'pi kāla ihoditaḥ |	From that moment onwards immediately or after the lapse of the time due to his credit for enjoying life, he, on the fall of the body, has the possibility of departing to Siva.
yogyatā śivatādātmyayogārhatvamihocyate | pūrvaṃ kiṃ na tathā kasmāttadaiveti na saṅkam | | tathābhāsanamujjhitvā na hi kālo'sti kaścana| svātantryāttu tathābhāse kālaśaktirvijṛmbhatām | natu paryanuyuktyai sā śive tatmahimoditā| nanu śaivī mahāśaktiḥ saṃbadvaivātmabhiḥ sthitā |	It is irrelevant to raise the question as to why the same was not spelt out any earlier, because the experience of oneness with Siva is unique even if guided by its own law which is coincident to its occurrence itself. -a The force of time manifests itself into the divisions of the past, present and future owing to the reflection of Siva in it with all His autonomy and by no means as a factor of unification of the individual with Him as that power lies in Siva Himself. b-a Siva's great power of covering lies always associated with the individual.
satyaṃ sācchādanātmā tu śāntā tveṣā svarūpadṛk | kṣobho hi bheda evaikyaṃ praśamastanmayī tataḥ | tayā śāntyā tu saṃbaddhaḥ sthitaḥ śaktisvarūpabhāk tyaktāṇubhāvo bhavati śivastacchaktidāḍhataḥ |	While that power remains covering the essential being from the individual's sight, His power known as śāntā serves the remover of the covering for his self-realisation. b-a Agitation in the Self of the individual is due to its experience of difference from Siva while His force known as Sāntā is unifying. Due to its close association with that force, the Self remains possessed of that force and gets relieved of its atomism and becomes restored to its Siva-hood by virtue of that force.
tatrāpi tāratamyādivaśācchīghracirāditaḥ | dehapāto bhavedasya yadvā kāṣṭhāditulyatā |	b- Here also there may be two possibilities: the individual may get relieved of his individuality immediately or subsequently involving immediate fall of the body or after an interval of remaining bodily inert like a log of wood, etc.
samastavyavahāreṣu parācīnitacetanaḥ| tīvratīvramahāśaktisamāviṣṭaḥ sa sidhyati | |	As against the second alternative as mentioned above the liberated Self remaining possessed of the extremely intensive Force, retains his being enjoying all what is available in life, however, with the core of his consciousness directed towards the supernal consciousness.
evaṃ prāgviṣayo grantha iyānanyatra tu sphuṭam | granthāntaraṃ madhyatīvraśaktipātāṃśasūcakam | |	Up to this point, this text is obviously devoted to discussion on the extremely intensive form of descent of Force while the subsequent part of it is scheduled to deal with the medium kind of intensive descent of Force.

ekastriko'yaṃ nirṇīta śaktipāte'pyathāparaḥ | tīvramadhye tu dīkṣāyāṃ kṛtāyāṃ na tathā dṛḍhām | svātmano vetti śivatāṃ dehānte tu śivo bhavet | uktaṃ ca niśisaṃcārayogasaṃcāraśāstrayoḥ | vikalpāttu tanau sthitvā dehānte śivatāṃ vrajet | madhyamadhye śaktipāte śivalābhotsuko'pi san | |	Thus has been explained the intensive kind of descent of force in all its three varieties, namely, intensively intensive, middling intensive and lowly intensive.

iti brūte yiyāsutvaṃ vaktavyaṃ nānyathā dhruvam | rudraśaktisamāviṣṭo nīyate sadguruṃ prati |	This is the sense of the term yiyāsuh, willing to go to the teacher, used in the text and this is not to be taken in any other sense. Indeed, it is only when he becomes stimulated by the power of Rudra that he wills like that.

chadmāpaśravaṇādyaistu tajjñānaṃ guhrato bhavet | prāyaścittamatastādṛgadhikāryatra kiṃ bhavet |	in this system. If this knowledge were to be received by anyone deceptively or through overhearing and he might have to make atonement subsequently for the fault, we have nothing to do with all that.
phalākāṅakṣāyutaḥ śiṣyastadekāyattasiddhikaḥ | dhruvaṃ pacyeta narake pāyaścittyupasevanāt | |	The student of such a teacher in spite of his aspiration for a beneficial result is sure to land himself in hell as a result of his service to such a fake teacher all his atonement notwithstanding.
tirobhāvaprakāro'yaṃ yattādṛśi niyojitaḥ | gurau śive na tadbhaktiḥ śaktipāto'sya nocyate | yadā tu vaicitryavaśājjānīyāttasya tādṛśam | viparītapravṛttatvaṃ jñānaṃ tasmādupāharet | |	The deceptive way of reception of knowledge in this manner is neither demonstrative of devotion on behalf of the teacher nor towards Siva nor even is congenial for descent of the force on the student. If the student of such a teacher were to understand the reality of the teacher incidentally, he needs to return it to him as a matter of gift, leave his proximity and strive for receiving the real knowledge from a genuine teacher.
vaiṣṇavādestathā śaivaṃ jñānamāhatya sanmatiḥ | sa hi bhedaikavṛttitvaṃ śivajñāne śrute'pyalam |	-a As a king confiscates the object of theft received from a thief, even so the man of noble intention should treat such knowledge regarding Saivism received from a Vaisnava, etc. b-a Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness...
nojjhatīti dṛḍhaṃ vāmādhiṣṭhitastatpaśūttamaḥ| śivenaiva tirobhāvya sthāpito niyaterbalāt | |	If a student of Śaivism does not get free of dualism in spite of having received initiation into this discipline, he needs to be treated as a fettered individual, pasu, though the best one amongst them.
kathaṅkāraṃ patipadaṃ prayātu paratantritaḥ | svacchandaśāstre proktaṃ ca vaiṣṇavādiṣu ye ratāḥ | bhramayatyeva tānmāyā hyamokṣe mokṣalipsayā | vaiṣṇavādiḥ śaivaśāstraṃ melayannijaśāsane |	b-a Kept intervened from Śiva by Śiva Himself unfortunately, such a fettered individual has least possibility of attaining redemption. b-a In the Svacchanda Sāstra it has been observed that those who are engaged in systems of spiritual practice like Vaisnavism, the force of māyā makes them wander in bondage under the craving for liberation. b-a If a śaiva proceeds on the mixed path of Śaivism and Vaisnavism, etc.
dhruvaṃ saṃśayamāpanna ubhayabhraṣṭatāṃ vrajet | svadṛṣṭau paradṛṣṭau ca samayollaṅghanādasau | |	he is sure to have landed himself on a doubtful course and hence is definite not to reach anyone of the two ends. b-a Such practitioner transgresses the principles of his own discipline as well as those of the other and consequently lands himself into obstructions.
nānyaśāstrābhiyukteṣu śivajñānaṃ prakāśate | tanna saiddhāntiko vāme nāsau dakṣe sa no mate |	Therefore, he should not take to such a course. b-a In the Gahvara śāstra, Lord Śiva Himself has observed that the knowledge of Saivism does not prove illuminative in those who are engaged in other Sāstras.
kule kaule trike nāsau pūrva pūrvaḥ paratra tu | avacchinno'navacchedaṃ no vettyānantyasaṃsthitaḥ |	b-a The Saidhāntika knowledge is not available in the Vāma system, the Vāma in the Daksa, the Daksa in the Mata, the Mata in the Kula and the Kaula in the Trika, however, the latter ones are implicit in their former ones each.
tādṛkśaktinipāteddho yo drāgūrdhvamimaṃ nayet | ttagirinadīprāyāvacchinne kṣetrapīṭha |	On account of this state of things, the Trika system needs to be taken as implicit in all the systems mentioned in this series.
uttarottaravijñāne nādhikāryadharo'dharaḥ| uttarottaramācāryaṃ vidannapyadharodharaḥ | |	b-a The limited cannot understand what is unlimited as he lies on the lower rung of understanding while he who is established in the infinitude lies above on the higher rung and is an authorised teacher.
kurvannadhikriyāṃ śāstralaṅghī nigrahabhājanam | śaktipātabalādeva jñānayogyavicitratā |	b-a In spite of the availability of a teacher of higher understanding of the system, if someone chooses to take resort to a teacher of the lower category, he needs to be treated as a transgressor of the system and liable to restraint. Indeed, the worth of a teacher rests on his status in relationship to the descent of the force of consciousness on him.
śrautaṃ cintāmayaṃ yātmabhāvanāmayameva ca | jñānaṃ taduttaraṃ jyāyo yato mokṣaikakāraṇam |	b- a Knowledge is of three kinds, that which is acquired through listening, that which is the result of contemplation and that which has been assimilated in the form of feeling, emotion and sentiment, bhāvanā.
tattvebhya uddharti kvāpi yojanaṃ sakale'kale | kathaṃ kuryādvinā jñānaṃ bhāvanāmayamuttamam | | yogī tu prāptatattattvasiddhirapyuttame pade | sadāśivādye svabhyastajñānitvādeva yojakaḥ |	Having liberated himself from the elements and thus risen from the state of bondage of the force of division to the state of integrality, how can the aspirant elevate himself to the highest state of understanding of oneness with Siva without being transformed accordingly in his feelings, emotions and sentiments? By virtue of his practice of yoga, the yogin may have obtained control over the elements and via that attained such a higher state as that of Sadāsiva and hence may elevate the student up to Him by means of his knowledge acquired through practice of yoga.
adhareṣu ca tattveṣu yā siddhiryogajāsya sā | vimocanāyāṃ nopāya sthitāpi dhanadāravat |	The state of accomplishment in the realm of spirituality, siddhi, the yogin has attained on lower elements, does not suffice to liberate anyone beyond furnishing him with objects of comfort such a wealth and wife.
yastūtpannasamastādhvasiddhiḥ sa hi sadāśivaḥ | sākṣādeṣa kathaṃ martyānmocayedgurutāṃ vrajan | tenoktaṃ mālinītantre vicārya jñānayogite | yataśca mokṣadaḥ proktaḥ svabhyastajñānavānbudhaiḥ |	As such, how can he redeem mortals directly by himself having assured the role of a teacher? Therefore, it is has been stated in Mālinīvijayottara Tantra that having brooded over the relative worth of knowledge and yoga in regard to redemption, wise men have reached the conclusion that liberation is attainable only to one who has become wise by virtue of treading the path of knowledge.
tasmātsvabhyastavijñānataivaikaṃ gurulakṣaṇam | vibhāgastveṣa me proktaḥ śaṃbhunāthena darśyate | mokṣajñānaparaḥ kuryādguruṃ svabhyastavedanam | anyaṃ tyajetprāptamapi tathācoktaṃ śivena tat |	Therefore, the ultimate criterion of a teacher is to have acquired the real knowledge through self-experience. As regards, the classification of such knowledge as communicated to me by my teacher Śambhunātha, is as follows: Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... The student keen to attain liberation should take resort to one as his teacher who might have acquired knowledge through self-experience.
āmodārthī yathā bhṛṅgaḥ puṣpātpuṣpāntaraṃ vrajet | vijñānārthī tathā śiṣyo gurorgurvantaraṃ vrajet | |	This has also been stated by Siva Himself as follows: As a black bee in its craving for the smell of its choice flies from one flower to another even so the student in his attempt to find out the proper teacher needs to move from teacher to teacher.
śaktihīnaṃ guruṃ prāpya mokṣajñāne kathaṃ śrayet | naṣṭamūle drume devi kutaḥ puṣpaphalādikam | uttarottaramutkarṣalakṣmīṃ paśyannapi sthitaḥ | adhame yaḥ pade tasmātko'nyaḥ syāddaivadagdhakaḥ |	Why should a student take resort to a teacher for the sake of redemptive knowledge if the latter himself is incapable of delivering the same? How can we expect flower and fruit, etc. of a tree, O Goddess, which has lost its root ? In spite of being in sight of higher and higher ranges of the path of spiritual wealth, he who remains stagnant on the lowest step, who other than him may be the worst killer of his destiny ? He who aspires for the beatitude of life, liberation and true kind of knowledge at one place, needs to take resort to a teacher who might have acquired his knowledge through self-experience proceeding along the path of yoga.
yastu bhogaṃ ca mokṣaṃ ca vāñchedvijñānameva ca | svabhyastajñāninaṃ yogasiddhaṃ sa gurumāśrayet | tadabhāve tu vijñānamokṣayorjñāninaṃ śrayet | bhuktyaṃśe yoginaṃ yastatphalaṃ dātuṃ bhavetkṣamaḥ | phaladānākṣame yoginyupāyaikopadeśini | varaṃ jñānī yo'bhyupāyaṃ diśedapi ca mocayet | |	Sri Tantrāloka In the absence of such a teacher, the aspirant needs to take resort to the teacher who might be conversant with such knowledge as may be convincingly true and deep as well as redemptive in its effect. So far as the experience of the beatitude of life is concerned, for the sake of it he is advised to go to such a yogin who may be capable of redeeming him. In the case of unavailability of even such a teacher who may not be capable of according redemption beyond sheer instruction about it, one should go to such a teacher who may impart the instruction about liberation as well as make access to it.
jñānī na pūrṇa evaiko yadi hyaṃśāṃśikākramāt | jñānānyādāya vijñānaṃ kurvītākhaṇḍamaṇḍalam | |	In thecase of unavailability of an integrally all-knowing teacher, the aspirant needs to take recourse to several teachers in turns who may fulfil his aspiration for getting his entire circle of special knowledge completed.
tenāsaṃkhyāngurūnkuryātpūraṇāya svasaṃvidaḥ | dhanyastu pūrṇavijñānaṃ jñānārthī labhate gurum | | nānāgurvāgamasrotaḥ pratibhāmātramiśritam | kṛtvā jñānārṇavaṃ svābhirvipruḍbhiḥ plāvayenna kim | |	- Having derived the right knowledge from different sources including texts and teachers and having filled this sea of knowledge with the mixture of his intuitive insight with it whom may an aspirant of knowledge not take across the sea of the world seating him on the boat of his self-experience ? Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... My honourable teacher Kallata has stated as follows: “The long tradition of my teachers begins with Tapana and ends with Motaka from each one of whom I have received instruction.
ā tapanānmoṭakāntaṃ yasya me'sti gurukramaḥ | tasya me sarvaśiṣyasya nopadeśadaridratā |	As such, there is no dearth of teaching stuff in me.” -a I also have rendered service to teachers of such lower disciplines as Nyāya, Veda, Buddhism, Jainism, Vaisnavism, etc.
ahamapyata evādhaśāstra dṛṣṭikutūhalāt | |	out of sheer curiosity to understand what they had to tell us in regard to the Reality.
tārkika śrauta bauddhārhadvaiṣṇavādīnnaseviṣi | lokādhyātmātimārgādikarmayogavidhānataḥ |	b-a The aspirant needs to go into contact with such disciplines as the materialistic, spiritualistic, transcendent and Karma-yoga in accordance with their rules and find place for them as per their standpoints in the contemplated holistic system as they, too, have embodied in them someone or the other point of excellence worthy of consideration.
prāgvaiṣṇavāḥ saugatāśca siddhāntādividastataḥ | kramāttrikārthavijñānacandrotsukitadṛṣṭayaḥ |	b-a Primeval questioners like Nārada, etc., were early Vaisnavas Saugatas and Siddhantins also became gradually curious to understand the secret of moonlight of the Trika system.
tasmānna gurubhūyastve viśaṅketa kadācana | gurvantararate mūḍhe āgamāntarasevake | |	Therefore, the aspirant should never be suspicious of the multiplicity of teachers he may have to take resort to.
pratyavāyo ya āmnātaḥ sa itthamiti gṛhyatām | yo yatra śāstre'dhikṛtaḥ sa tatra gururucyate | | tatrānadhikṛto yastu tadgurvantaramucyate | yathā tanmaṇḍalāsīno maṇḍalāntarabhūpatim | |	b-a The prohibition in regard to the teacher needs to be taken as follows: That foolish man should be treated as an outcaste who devotes himself to the teacher of a discipline other than his and to the discipline itself which is not his. b-a He who is authorised in a particular discipline, is regarded as teacher of that discipline. He who is not authorised in the particular discipline is known as teacher of another discipline.
svamaṇḍalajigīṣuḥ sansevamāno vinaśyati | tathottarottarajñānasiddhiprepsuḥ samāśrayan |	b-a As a ruler of a part of the country known as mandala engages himself to the service of another ruler of it with a wish to recover its rulership to himself gets lost even so the student aspiring for competence in some higher course of study devotes himself to a lower order of teacher and is put to a loss.
adharādharamācaryaṃ vināśamadhigacchati | evamevordhvavartiṣṇorāgamātsiddhivāñchakaḥ | māyīyaśāstranirato vināśaṃ pratipadyate | uktaṃ ca śrīmadānande karma saṃśritya bhāvataḥ | jugupsate tattasmiṃśca viphale'nyatsamāśrayet | dinād dinaṃ hrasaṃstvevaṃ pacyate rauravādiṣu |	b-a Similar is the destiny of one who though engaged in the study of some such discipline which is concerned with the course of delusion, māyā, wishes to gain competence in a text which is of higher order in its nature. It has also been stated in the text known as Ananda that having undertaken willingly some such Deliberation on the Descent of the Force of Consciousness... task which he disdains, the person concerned fails and then takes to another with the same kind of dichotomy between duty and choice is sure to fail again and again day by day ending up in landing himself in the hell known as Raurava, etc.
yastūrdhvordhvapathaprepsuradharaṃ gurumāgamam | jihāsecchaktipātena sa dhanyaḥ pronmukhokṛtaḥ |	b- One who is an aspirant of attaining higher and higher states of being needs to abstain himself from the study of a lower kind of literature as well as from the service of the same kind of teacher.
ata eveha śāstreṣu śaiveṣveva nirūpyate | śāstrāntarārthānāśvastānprati saṃskārako vidhiḥ |	This is why śaivite texts have provided us with the method of conversion of such people into Saivism who have shifted to it out of conviction from various other Sāstras.
ataścāpyuttamaṃ śaivaṃ yo'nyatra patitaḥ sa hi | ihānugrāhya ūrdhvordhvaṃ netastu patitaḥ kvacit | |	This is also the excellence of Saivism that it provides for acceptance in it for raising people upward step by step while anyone failing from it is not acceptable anywhere else.
ata eva hi sarvajñairbrahmaviṣṇvādibhirnije | na śāsane samāmnātaṃ liṅgaddhārādi kiṃcana |	This is why there is no such provision as lingoddhāra in the tradition of Vaisnavites and worshippers of Brahmā in spite of all their claim of omniscience.
tathāvighāmeva marti satyasaṃsparśanākṣamām | dṛṣṭvaiṣāṃ brahmaviṣṇvādyairbuddhairapi tathoditam |	The same kind of short sightedness incapable of facing the truth has been displayed by wise ones from amongst the followers of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, etc. also in their instructions.
ityeṣa yuktayāgamataḥ śaktipāto vivecitaḥ | tirobhāvasvarūpaṃ tu kathyamānaṃ vivicyatām | svabhāvāt parameśāno niyatyaniyatikramam | spṛśanprakāśate yena tataḥ svacchanda ucyate| niyatiṃ karmaphalayorāśrityaiṣa maheśvaraḥ |	Please explain the Supreme Lord's tendency of self-concealment. Since the Lord manifests Himself via the process of touching both the ends of creation, namely, determination and indetermination, He is characterised as autonomous. -a Having taken resort to the determination of the relationship of action and result, the Lord engages Himself in creation, sustenance and dissolution as side effects of existence, consciousness and delight.
sṛṣṭisaṃsthitisaṃhārānvidhatte'vāntarasthitīn | mahāsarge punaḥ sṛṣṭisaṃhārānantyaśālini | eka sa devo viśvātmā niyatityāgataḥ prabhuḥ|	b-a Since at the end of the great dissolution following the processes of creation, sustenance and dissolution everything gets dissolved into the state of infinitude, only the Supreme Lord as the Universal Self remains the sovereign ruler of all by virtue of departing from the determination.
avāntare yā ca sṛṣṭi sthitiścātrāpyayantritam |	b-a In the next round of creation and sustenance also He exists in all the sense of existence as such but remaining absolutely indeterminate.
nojjhatyeṣa vapustyaktaniyatiśca sthito'tra tat | niyatyaiva yadā caiṣa svarūpācchādanakramāt | bhuṅkte duḥkhavimohādi tadā karmaphalakramaḥ | tyaktvā tu niyamaṃ kārmaṃ duḥkhamohaparītatām |	b-a By virtue of His determinate character in the process of His self-concealment when He experiences pain and illusion, etc., then is born the process of action and result. Leaving apart the law of action in view of its being surrounded by pain and illusion He wishes to manifest Himself. He becomes mindful of the tendency of self-concealment.
bibhāsayiṣurāste'yaṃ tirodhāne'napekṣakaḥ | yathā prakāśasvātantryāt pratibuddho'pyabuddhavat | āste tadvadanuttīrṇo'pyuttīrṇa iva ceṣṭate | yathā ca buddhastāṃ mūḍhaceṣṭāṃ kurvannapi dviṣan |	b-a Due to autonomy of the illumination, the luminous also behaves as if it were shorn of luminosity; even so the bound also begins to show as if it were liberated. b-a As an enlightened person out of his tendency of self-concealment behaves as if he was a fool though disliking the same at heart, even so is the pattern of behaviour of the enlightened.
hāste mūḍha evaṃ hi prabuddhānāṃ viceṣṭitam | śrīvidyādhipatiścāha mānastotre tadīdṛśam |	Vidyādhipati also has stated the same in his Manastotra.
ye yauṣmāke śāsanamārge kṛtadīkṣā saṃgacchanto mohavaśādvipratipattim | nūnaṃ teṣāṃ nāsti bhavadbhānuniyogaḥ | saṅkocaḥ kiṃ sūryakaraistāmarasānām | jñātajñeyā dhātṛpadasthā api santo ye tvanmārgātkāpathagāste'pi na samyak | prāyasteṣāṃ laiṅkikabuddhyādisamuttho mithyābodhaḥ sarpavasādīpajakalpaḥ | yasmādviddhaṃ sūtakamukhyena nu tāmraṃ tadyadbhūyaḥ svāṃ prakṛtiṃ no samupeyāt | no taiḥ pītaṃ bhūtalasaṃsthairamṛtaṃ tadyeṣāṃ tṛṭkṣudduḥkhavibādhāḥ punarasmin |	b- Deliberation on the Rite as Prescribed in the śāstra “Those who in spite of being initiated in your discipline take to the adverse path on account of delusion, certainly the illumination of your knowledge has not reached their inner being as the ray of the sun, the lotus flowers which have remained bereft of bloom." “In spite of having learnt whatever they were required to learn, and thus were expected to have ascended the lofty position of the Creator Himself, those who take to the wrong path, certainly the real message of the emblem did not reach their hearts like the flame of the lamp produced out of snake's marrow creating the sense of snake everywhere.” “As a piece of copper transformed chemically into gold by the goldsmith cannot be restored to its stuff, similarly, one who has drunk ambrosia on the earth itself cannot be brought back to the state of thirst, hunger and experience of pain.” Therefore one who falsely displays himself by means of mantra, service to gods, and worship, etc.
na cāsya karmamahimā tādṛgyenetthamāsta saḥ | kiṃ hi tatkarma kasmādvā pūrveṇātra samo vidhiḥ | tasmātsā parameśecchā yayāyaṃ mohitastathā | anantakālasaṃvedyaduḥ khapātratvamīhate |	In this misfortune of him, possibly there is no role of anyone of his past actions on account of which he has happened to behave like this. What such an action may be and on what account it may bear resemblance with his present day misconduct ? Therefore, it is due to the will of the Lord that he has fallen victim to this kind of delusion and has made himself subject to endless suffering.
tatrāpi cecchāvaicitryādihāmutrobhayātmakaḥ | duḥkhasyāpi vibhedo'sti ciraśaiyakṛtasthā |	In this role of the Lord's will also there is the peculiarity of the consequence to be suffered in this world, other world or both the worlds. The misery to be suffered also has the peculiarity of delay and quickness.
kālakāmāndhakādīnāṃ paulastyapuravāsinām| tathānyeṣāṃ tirobhāvastāvadduḥkho hyamutra ca |	This kind of consequence of the will of the Lord gets exemplified by the fate of the people of the settlers of the town of Paulastya, namely, Kāla, Kāma, Andhaka, etc. amounting to their banishment involving suffering in this world as well as in the other.
anyo'pi ca tirobhāvaḥ samayollaṅghaṣunātmakaḥ | yaduktaṃ parameśena śrīmadānandagahvare | samayollaṅaghanāddevi kravyādatvaṃ śataṃ samāḥ| tatrāpi mandatīvrādibhedādbahuvidhaḥ kramaḥ |	Deliberation on the Rite as Prescribed in the śāstra Another kind of banishment is the result of violation of the observance of the rule of discipline laid down by the teacher on the occasion of initiation, as has been said in the text Anandagahvara by the Lord Himself addressed to the Goddess that on account of violation the violator is destined to fall down to the life of raw meat-eater for a hundred years. In this respect also the punishment may be of several kinds such as mild and harsh.
svātantryācca maheśasya tirobhūto'pyasau svayam | paradvāreṇa vābhyeti bhūyo'nugrahamapyam |	- On account of the autonomy of the Lord, the victim of banishment may avail himself considerably of the benefit of the grace of the Lord through his own effort or via that of anyone else.
bhūyo'nugrahataḥ prāyaścitādyācaraṇe sati | anusāreṇa dīkṣādau kṛte syācchivatāmayaḥ | tirobhūta paretāsurapi bandhusuhṛdgurun| ālambya śaktipātena dīkṣādyairanugṛhyate |	the individual may get initiated again leading ultimately to the possibility of his attaining Śiva-hood. The victim of banishment has the prospect of availing himself of the opportunity of the grace of the Lord even after his departure from this world through the help of his relatives, friends, and teachers via initiation, descent of force, etc.
tatrāpi kālaśīghratvaciratvādivibhedatām | tathaiti śaktipāto'sau yenāyāti śivātmatām |	In regard to descent of the force of consciousness in the form of intuition also there are variations of quickness and delay, etc. followed by oneness with Siva.
itthaṃ sṛṣṭisthitidhvaṃsatirobhāvamanugrahaḥ | iti pañcasu kartatvaṃ śivatvaṃ saṃvidātmanaḥ |	Thus, in all these five acts of Śiva, namely, creation, sustenance, dissolution, concealment and showering of grace, lies implicit the role of Siva in the form of consciousness.
pañcakṛtyasvatantratvasaṃpūrṇasvātmamāninaḥ | yogino'rcājapadhyānayogā saṃsyuḥ sadoditāḥ |	Yogins experiencing all these five acts of Śiva taking place continuously within themselves reflecting His autonomy within them amount to his remaining constantly engaged in His worship, japa and yoga of meditation.
aindrajālikavṛttānte na rajyeta kadācana | sādāśivo'pi yo bhogo bandhaḥ so'yucitātmanām |	The aspirant should never indulge himself in worldly enjoyments, disdaining it as a matter of momentary show like magic. Enjoyment even up to Sadāśiva is a matter of bondage for those who care for their Self.
jñātṛtvameva śivatā svātantryaṃ tadihocyate | kulālavattu kartṛtvaṃ na mukhyaṃ tadadhiṣṭhiteḥ |	The role of the potter in manufacturing pots is only secondarily his as the Lord as the primary manufacturer lies behind the seen as his consciousness.
iti jñātvā grahītavyā naiva jātvapi khaṇḍanā | śivo'haṃ cenmadicchānuvarti kiṃ na jagattviti | mamecchāmanuvartantāmityatrāhaṃvidi sphuret | śivo vā parameśāno dehādiratha nirmitaḥ |	- Having understood one's status as such, one should never take oneself as merely a fraction of Him. On admittance like this, the problem may arise as to why is it that the world does not go as per my wishes? Deliberation on the Rite as Prescribed in the Sāstra The wish that world should move as per my wishes, is a desire stimulated under the presumption of the ego. Siva Himself is the Supreme Lord in keeping with whose will the body, etc.
śivasya tāvadastyetaddehastveṣa tathā tvayā | kṛtaḥ kānyā dehatāsya tatkiṃ syādvācyatāpadam |	It is via the ownership of this body going to Śiva that it has been accredited to you. In view of its impossibility otherwise, it is not liable to condemnation of any kind.
uktaṃ ca siddhasantāśrīmadūrmimahākule | pavanabhramaṇaprāṇavikṣepādikṛtaśramāḥ kuhakādiṣu ye bhrāntāste bhrāntāḥ parame pade |	It has been mentioned in the text known as Urmikaula that those who have gained competence in such extraordinary capacities as to move in the airy space, stoppage of breath, etc., they have lost their way in fog, etc. and hence should be taken to have gone astray from the object of their ultimate goal as well.
sarvatra bahumānena vāpyutkrāntirvimuktaye |	-a Wilful departure from the body is generally taken to enter into the state of liberation.
prokto sā sāraśāstreṣu bhogopāyatayoditā | yadi sarvagato devo vadotkramya kva yāsyati |	In Sāraśāstras, however, it has been taken to mean access to the state of enjoyment. b-a Please tell me where will he go when the Lord Himself obtains everywhere ? Now, if the Lord is not all-pervading, He would get reduced to the status of a particular object such as is the case with a jar.
athāsarvagatastarhi ghaṭatulyastadā bhavet | utkrāntividhiyogo'yamekadeśena kathyate |	b-a A section of the scholarship tells us that the rite of utkrānti, upward movement, amounts to mean the yoga by means of which the self of the individual is mobilised from one place to the other.
niraṃśe śivatattve tu kathamutkrāntisaṃgatiḥ | yathā dharādau vāyvante bhṛgvambvagnyupavāsakaiḥ |	b-a As would be the result of transcendence from the earth up to the air by virtue of austerity, even so may be the consequence of elevation of them from space as well.
ātmano yojanaṃ vyomni tadvadrutkrāntivartanā| tasmānnotkramayejjīvaṃ paratattvasamīhayā |	In view of only this prospect one should not elevate anyone with the expectation of making him reach the Ultimate Reality.
śrīpūrvaśāstre tūktaṃ yadutkrānterlakṣaṇaṃ na tat | muktyupāyatayā kiṃtu bhogahānyai tathaiṣaṇāt |	b- What has been stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra as the definition of utkrānti is not meant for being taken as the means of liberation but for getting free from the desire for enjoyment.
japadhyānādisaṃsiddhaḥ svātantryācchaktipātataḥ | bhogaṃ prati viraktaśceditthaṃ dehaṃ tyajediti |	It amounts to suggest that one should become the body only when he has become completely established in his Self through japa, meditation, autonomous descent of force, etc. besides having become a renunciate.
svacchandamṛtyorapi yad bhīṣmādeḥ śrūyate kila | bhogavairasyasaṃprāptau jīvitāntopasarpaṇam |	- As regards the statement of Mahābhārata, concerning Bhisma, etc. in the context of leaving the body, concerns the precondition of having become renunciate towards enjoyment.
yogamantrāmṛtadravyavarādyaiḥ siddhibhāktanuḥ | hātuṃ nahyanyathā śakyā vinoktakramayogataḥ |	Deliberation on the Rite as Prescribed in the Sāstra One who has made his body fully accomplished, siddha, through the practice of yoga, mantra, award of boon, drinking of ambrosia, etc., cannot leave the body via any other way except for the method as has been indicated herewith.

Dvipatha is formed on account of meeting of two paths, tripatha on account of three paths and catuṣpatha on account of consideration of the meeting of the Lord of the force on the Tripatha. The loci of these junctions in the body are the points of end of the nose and end of the hole of the palate near the uvula.

These ends of the entire path of life include the functions of Brahmā, Visnu and Siva, involvement of the navel, kanda, genitals of the male and the female, cremation ground and the state of liberation in the form of oneness with Śiva all these having been derived via the method of derivation amounting to all kinds of experience from the state of birth to that of liberation.
tadādhiṣṭhite ca cakre śārīre bahiratho bhavedyāgaḥ | muktaye tanna yāgasya sthānabhedaḥ prakalpyate |	All this is taking place in the centres of the body itself as also is being treated externally as series of sacrifices.

sādhyaṃ tadasya dāḍhana saphalatvāya kalpate | ukta śrīsāraśāstre ca nirvikalpo hi siddhyati |	b-a It has been stated in the Sāra śāstra that exclusive devotion to the objective leads to success while diversion in it ends up in trouble in spite of aeons of effort.
kliśyante savikalpāstu kalpokte'pi kṛte sati | tadākramya balaṃ mantrā ayamevodayaḥ sphuṭaḥ |	b-a Elimination of diversion in the attention and objective provides force to the effort and unveils the secret leading to obvious success.

Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation Since none of the means of worship is other than Śiva Himself, it is inclusive not only of persons and objects but also actions like movement, etc. As a horse trained for an army, performs all functions it is trained to discharge, irrespective of its mode including carrying the burden, movement of the army, etc.

kurvanti te śivā eva tānpūrṇānprati kiṃ phalam | vināpi jñānayogābhyāṃ kriyā nyāsārcanādikā |	b-a This act of posturing oneself even without any initiative in knowledge and yoga may imbue one with oneness with Siva, the highest result of all kinds of undertakings.

tena śuddhaṃ tu sarvaṃ yadaśuddhamapi tacchuci | aśuddhatā ca vijñeyā paśutacchāsanāśayāt | |	Therefore, whatever lies even close to the place of worship becomes enlivened by the grace of consciousness.

arcāyai yogyamānando yasmādunmagnatā citaḥ | tenācidrūpadehādiprādhānyavinimajjakam |	b-a Suitability of arousal of consciousness as the means of sacrifice lies in raising properly the consciousness and delight upward which had remained dormant until now. b-a Thus, it becomes obvious how body, etc.

yoginīśca pṛthaṅmantrairoṃnamonāmayojitaiḥ | ekoccāreṇa vā bāhyaparivāretiśabditāḥ | | tāro nāma caturthyantaṃ namaścetyarcane manuḥ | evaṃ bahi pūjayitvā dvāraṃ prokṣya prapūjayet |	Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation The method of worshiping the Yoginis may be separate for each of them with the mantra, 'Om namo tasyai name of the deity concerned with the use of the fourth case-ending or for all of them together with the use of the word tāra Om yogini parivārebhyah namah with the same case-ending. -a Having performed worship like this outside, the door needs to be sprinkled with water and worshipped.
triśiraḥ śāsanādau ca sa dṛṣṭo vidhirucyate | gaṇeśalakṣmyau dvārordhve dakṣe vāme tayoḥ punaḥ | |	This is the method of worshipping these deities known as Yoginis, as per the prescription laid down in the text Trisiro Bhairava.
madhye vāgīśvarīṃ diṇḍimahodarayugaṃ tathā | kramātsvadakṣavāmasthaṃ tathaitena krameṇa ca | ekaikaṃ pūjayetsamyaṅ nandikālau trimārgagām | kālindīṃ chāgameṣāsyau svadakṣāvāḥ sathaśākhayoḥ|	b-a At the top of the door should be placed the statues of Ganesa and Laksmi on the right and left sides with Vāgiśvari in the middle of them. So should be placed and worshipped the deities known as Dindi and Mahodara on the right and left sides accordingly. Here also need to be worshipped Nandi, Kāla, Gangā in her triple streams and Yamunā. Images of a he-goat placed on the right side and that of a sheep on the left also need to be worshipped.
adhodehalyananteśādhāraśaktīśca pūjayet | dvāramadhye sarasvatyā mahāstraṃ pūjayedamī |	b- Below the door are to be worshipped the deities Ananta and Sakti. In the middle of the door should be worshipped Sarasvati along with her weapons, bell and lute.
padmādhāragatāḥ sarve'pyuditā vighnanāśakāḥ | pūjane pūrvavanmantro dīpakādvayakalpitaḥ |	They all are removers of hindrance. The same mantra should be used in the worship of these deities also as referred to in verse No. above besides keeping burning two earthen lamps on both sides of the door.
arghapuṣpasamālambhadhūpanaivedyavandanaiḥ | pūjāṃ kuryādihārghaścāpyuttamadravyayojitaḥ|	- Worship may be performed by accessories of it such as flower, paste, perfume, naivedya, prayer and other materials of the best possible quality and purity.
ekoccāreṇa vā kuryāddvāḥ sthadaivatapūjanam rahasyapūjāṃ cetkuryāttadvāhyaparivārakam |	If the worship be intended to be kept secret, it needs to be performed inwardly within oneself warding off its expression outside.
dvā sthāṃśca pūjayedantardevāgre kalpanākramāt | kṣiptvāstrajaptaṃ kusumaṃ jvaladveśmani vighnanut | praviśya śivaraśmīddhadṛśā veśmāvalokayet | diśo'streṇa ca baghnīyācchādayedvarmaṇākhilāḥ |	Deities of the door should be worshipped in the beginning as per their order by offering to them flowers along with muttering of mantras dedicated to weapons. This offer made in the sacrificial house glittering with the light of the sacrificial fire would dispel obstruction in the course of the performance. Having entered into the house, the student needs to cast his eyesight all over inside it, binding it from all directions by means of mantras dedicated to weapons besides covering it with the armour.
tatrottarāśābhimukho mumukṣustādṛśāya vā | viśettathā hyaghorāgniḥ pāśānpluṣyati bandhakān |	Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation Having entered the house the student aspiring for liberation or anyone else imbued with the same kind of aspiration needs to sit facing north. The fire known as aghora would thus burn down all the bonds he is supposed to be bound by.
yadyapyasti na diṅnāma kācitpūrvāparādikā | pratyayo hi na tasyāḥ syādekasyā anupāhiteḥ | |	As a matter of fact, there is no such entity as dik, direction, corresponding to the notion of east and west, in the absence of which notion, in spite of all its falsity, however, we cannot form any idea of locus of anything.
upādhi pūrvatādiṣṭa iti cettatkṛtaṃ diśā | upādhimātraṃ tu tathā vaicitryāya kathaṃ bhavet | | tasmātsaṃvitprakāśo'yaṃ mūrtyābhāsanabhāgataḥ| pūrvādidigvabhāgākhyavaicitryollekhadurmadaḥ |	If direction be treated as an adjunct indicative of the direction of the locus of anything meant in the context what harm may lie in its acceptance as a positive reality?. The answer to this query is that what is merely an adjunct cannot be regarded as positively real, otherwise what will remain there as the ground for its characterisation as an adjunct ? Therefore what needs to be understood is that direction is a part of the act of concretisation of the light of consciousness which lingers inordinately with our awareness in the form of what we call east, etc.
tatra yadyatprakāśena sadā svīkaraṇe kṣamam | tadevordhvaṃ prakāśātma sparśāyogmadhaḥ punaḥ |	Whatever is capable of being owned in the light of consciousness, is considered as lying above and whatever remains untouched is denigrated as lying below.
kiṃcitprakāśatā madhyaṃ tato vai diksamudbhavaḥ | kiṃcitprakāśayogyasya saṃmukhaṃ prasaratpuraḥ |	Things which lie in the middle of illumination and other way round are taken to lie in the middle.
parāṅmukhaṃ tu tatpaścāditi digdvayamāgatam | prakāśaḥ saṃmukhaṃ vastu gṛhītvodriktaraśmikaḥ | yatra tiṣṭheddakṣiṇaṃ tatprakāśasyānukūlyataḥ | dakṣiṇasya puraḥsaṃsthaṃ vāmamityupadiśyate |	Whatever part of the object reveals itself forward is considered as lying in the east and what as receding backward is taken to be in the west. This is how has arisen the notion of two directions. Having received the sense of the object lying in front of it the consciousness getting thus stimulated, whatever lies to its right hand favourably is named as south and whatever unfavourably is termed as the left.
tatprakāśitameyendusparśasaumyaṃ tadeva hi | evamāśācatuṣke'sminmadhyaviśrāntiyogataḥ |	The object of illumination being subjected to the illumination of the moon of self-consciousness as representative of Siva becomes mild in its look.
catuṣkamanyattenāṣṭau diśastattadadhiṣṭhitāḥ| evaṃ prakāśamātre'sminvarade parame śive |	-a Following the discernment of these four directions, those four lying intermediate to them make the number of them rise to eight.
digvibhāgaḥ sthito loke śāstre'pi ca tathocyate | kramātsadāśivādhīśaḥ pañcamantratanuryataḥ | | īśanraghoravāmākhyasadyo'dhobhedato diśaḥ | īśa ūrdhvaṃ prakāśatvāpūrvaṃ vaktraṃ prasāri yat |	b-a This is how the notion of division of space in the form of directions and sub- directions has emerged particularly in the light of pure consciousness which is the highest status of Śiva and has become admitted both in the Śāstras as well as in the actual use in the human behaviour all over the world. b-a Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation Lord Śiva has five faces in the form of mantras known as Isa, Nr, Aghora, Vāmadeva, and Sadyojāta besides the Adhojāta standing for the additional sixth, that is, the downward.
puruṣo dakṣiṇācaṇḍo vāmā vāmastu saumyakaḥ | parāṅmukhatayā sadyaḥ paścimā paribhāṣyate | pātālavaktramadharamaprakāśatayā sthiteḥ | khamarudvahnijalabhūkhāni vaktrāṇyamuṣya hi |	Isa stands for the upward on account of its luminousness, Nr for the east on account of its expansiveness, Aghora for the south on account of its terrific nature, Vāmadeva for the north on account of its loveliness, Sadyojāta for the west on account of its contrariety to the east and Adhomukha for the downward due to its lacking in illumination. The same faces stand also for the five senses as well as for the five elements, namely, space, air, fire, water and earth.
mukhyatvena khamevordhvaṃ prakāśamayamucyate | tadeva mukhyato'dhastādaprakāśaṃ yataḥ sphuṭam |	b- Space is characterised as lying upward on account of its luminousness while the same as downward because of its darkness.
madhye tu yatprakāśaṃ tatra prakāśyaṃ na cetarat | prakāśatvāddiśyamānamato'smindikcatuṣṭayam |	Only the space lying intermediate to up and down is neither luminous nor dark. Due to lying intermediate to both of them, is operative here the division of it into the four directions.
pañcamantratanurnātha itthaṃ viśvadigīśvaraḥ | tato'pīśastathā rudro viṣṇurbrahmā tathā sthitaḥ |	Since the Lord has the five directions as His māntric bodies, He is characterised as the Lord of the five directions. Herein also abide the five presiding deities, namely, Sadāśiva, Isa, Rudra, Visnu and Brahmā.
ūrdhvābhivyaktyayogyatvādviṣṇordhātuṣca pañcamam| na vaktraṃ tau bhedamayau sṛṣṭisthitiprabhū yataḥ |	Sri Tantrāloka Since neither Brahmā nor Visnu is suggestive of upwardness, both of them being rather indicative of succession in terms of creation and sustenance, they are considered as standing in common for one and the same face of Śiva.
digvibhāgastu tajjo'sti vadanānāṃ catuṣṭayāt | pañcamasya yujitve tau parityaktanijātmakau | |	It is out of the four faces of Śiva that has arisen the idea of the four directions. As regards the relevance of the fifth direction, it foregoes its relevance in view of Brahmā and Visnu both sharing in one and the same face.
tato brahmāṇḍamadhye'pi jñānaśaktirvibho raviḥ | diśāṃ vibhāgaṃ kurute prakāśaghanavṛttimān |	In the context of the entire universe known as Brahmānda also, it is the sun as the representative of the Lord's power of knowledge who by virtue of his being light condensed as a ball moving all around in it is responsible for the division of space into the directions.
tathāpi viṣuvadyoge yataḥ pūrvaṃ pradṛśyate | tatpūrvaṃ yatra tacchāyā tatpaścimamudāhṛtam | tasmiñjigamiṣorasya yatsavyaṃ tattu dakṣiṇam | tatraiva caṇḍatejobhirbhāti jājvalyamānavat |	As regards his division of the directions, from the point of start of his movement known as visuvat, whatever section of space appears ahead of the viewer is called the east his shadow behind him as the west, what happens to be on his right hand side is known as the south where the sun remains burning with all his ferocity and what on the left hand side as imbued with his slightly milder illumination and hence mixed with partial darkness is the north.
yatrāsāvastamabhyeti tatpaścimamiti sthitiḥ | tatraiva paścime yeṣāṃ prākprakāśāvalokanam | tadeva pūrvameteṣāṃ yathādhvani nirūpitam | sā sā dikca tathā tasya phaladāpi viparyaye | vicitre phalasaṃpattiḥ prakāśādhīnikā yataḥ | itthaṃ sūryāśrayā diksyātsā vicitrāpi tādṛśī | adhiṣṭhitā maheśena citratadrūpadhāriṇā |	Standing with his back towards the point of the sun's setting, what appears in the view of the viewer, is called the east. All these details have been given in the Bhuvanādhvā section of this text -a The effect of these directions is determined by the viewer's face to light in terms of both positivity and negativity. b-a This is how the sense of direction is based on the sun in all its peculiarity on account of him being presided over by the Supreme Lord Himself in all His autonomy conducive to the peculiarity of His action.
kiṃ vātibahunā yo'sau yaṣṭā tatsaṃmukhāditaḥ | diśo'pi pravibhajyante prāksavyottarapaścimāḥ| svānusārakṛtaṃ taṃ ca digvibhāgaṃ sadā śivaḥ | adhitiṣṭhatyarkamiva sa vicitravapuryataḥ | svotthā api diśa sveśāḥ śakrādyā hyadhiśerate | |	b-a Needless to say anything more, wheresoever the sacrificer be, the directions get divided as per his standpoint in keeping with the principle of the front being the east, back the west, right hand side the south and the left hand side the north. b-a It is Śiva Himself in the form of the devotee who presides over the divisions of space in keeping with the infinite variability of His nature as He has a body abounding in peculiarities.
te hi prakāśaśaktyaṃśā prakāśānuvidhāyinaḥ | prakāśasya yadaiśvaryaṃ sa indro yattu tanmahaḥ | so'igniryantṛtvabhīmatve yamo rakṣastadūnimā | prakāśyaṃ varuṇastacca cāñcalyādvāyurucyate | bhāvasañcayayogena vitteśastatkṣaye vibhuḥ | adṛṣṭavigrahonanto brahmordhve vṛṃhako vibhuḥ |	b-a Directions have emerged from Him along with their presiding deities as Indra, etc. being fractions of the light and the force and hence are followers of their integral form as Siva, b-a His sovereignty over illumination assumes the form of Indra; His illumination itself is Agni, His controlling power takes the form of Yama; His assumption of negativity assumes the form of demons; His dependence on illumination takes the form of Varuna while His dynamics takes the form of Vāyu His nature of possessiveness assumes the form of Kubera while in the absence of the same He becomes Vibhu, the all-pervading.
prakāśasyaiva śaktyaṃśā lokapāstena kīrtitāḥ | itthaṃ svādhīnarūpāpi diksaurī tūpadiśyate | tatra sarvo hi niṣkampaṃ prakāśatvaṃ prapadyate | sarvago'pyanilo yadvadvyajanenopavījitaḥ |	With the invisibility of His figure, He becomes Ananta, the Infinite. With the ascendance of expansion in Him, He assumes the form of Brahmā. On account of being sparks of the Light, these deities are called Lokapālas, saviours of the world. b-a Thus though completely self-dependent, Dik, direction is termed as sauri, solar, since all whatever lies in it invariably moves towards light.
prabuddhaḥ svāṃ kriyāṃ kuryāddharmanirṇodanādikām | tadvatsarvagatāḥ sarvā aindrayādyā śaktayaḥ sphuṭam |	b-a Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation Though air is all-pervading, it is only on having been stimulated by a fan that it becomes awakened and performs all its duties such as mobilisation, etc. so is the case with forces related to Indra and other divinities.
sādhakāśvāsasaṃbuddhāstattatsveṣṭaphalapradāḥ |	Getting awakened for the consolation of the devotees, they accord the latter with results as aspired for by them.
evaṃ saurī digīśānabrahmaviṣṇvīśauśivaiḥ samāśvāsadārḍhyāttattatphalapradā | adhiṣṭhitā |	b-a So is the case with Dik, directions, as related to the sun. They are presided over by IŚāna, Brahmā, Visnu, Iśa and Sadāśiva and accord different kinds of fruits to their devotees as a means of consolation for the sake of confirmation of their faith in the Divine.
sādhako yacca vā kṣetraṃ maṇḍalaṃ veśma vā bhajet |	b-a In whichsoever area, circle or house the devotee be, Sankara happens to dwell there in the centre of it, as per his locus.
sthitastadanusāreṇa madhyībhavati śaṃkaraḥ | sa hi sarvamadhiṣṭhātā mādhyasthyeneti tasya yaḥ | saura prakāśastatpūrvamitthaṃ syāddigvyavasthitiḥ | tanmadhyasthitanāthasya grahītuṃ dakṣiṇaṃ mahaḥ |	b-a Lord Śiva presides over all owing to whose intermediation the solar light becomes determinant of the division of space into directions. b-a As the Lord lies in the middle of the sacrificial locus, the disciple ought to sit facing the north and for receiving the same illumination from behind, he should seat himself facing the east.
udaṅmukhaḥ syāt pāścātyaṃ grahītuṃ pūrvatomukhaḥ | upaviśya nijasthāne dehaśuddhiṃ samācaret |	Having seated himself like this, he should perform the ceremony of purification of his body.
aṅguṣṭhāgrātkālavahnijvālābhāsvaramutthitam | astraṃ dhyātvā tacchikhābhirbahirantardahettanum | dāhaśca dhvaṃsa evokto dhvaṃsakaṃ mantrasaṃjñitam | tejastathābhilāpākhyasvavikalparasombhitam |	b- From the tip of the toe emerges brilliant light known as kāla-vahni, fire in the form of time. Having meditated on it, uttering the weapon mantra, the aspirant needs to burn his body internally as well as externally by means of the visualisedflame of the fire. The word dāha, burning, used in the previous verse amounts literally to destroying.
tena mantrāgninā dāho dehe puryaṣṭake tathā | dehapuryaṣṭakāhantāvidhvaṃsādeva jāyate | |	Therefore, burning of the body by means of the fire of mantra means only getting rid of the eight sense of psychological factors of the personality known as puryastaka-comprising of manas, intellect, ego-sense, sense of hearing, touch, form, taste and smell.
nahi sadbhāvamātreṇa deho'sāvanyadehavat | ahantāyāṃ hi dehatvaṃ sā dhvastā taddaheddhruvam |	On account of its being the sheer body is meant here not like any other tangible body but bodiliness really in its egoity. Burning of it amounts to burning of the actual body psychologically.
taddehasaṃskārabharo bhasmatvenātha yaḥ sthitaḥ | taṃ varmavāyunādhūya tiṣṭhecchuddhacidātmani | tasmindhruve nistaraṅge samāpattimupāgataḥ | saṃvidaḥ sṛṣṭidharmitvādādyāmeti taraṅgitām |	The bodily sense having thus been burnt along with all its content of impressions, the ash of it needs to be blown away by the air of the armour. Getting thus perfectly cleansed, the aspirant should sit self-contained within the range of his consciousness. Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation On aspirant's sitting motionlessly in the state of complete absorption, there arises some sort of vibration in consciousness as the original nature of its creativity.
saiva mūrtiriti khyātā tārasadvinduhātmikā | tato navātmadevena nyāsastattvodayātmakaḥ |	That vibration itself is known as the concretised form, mūrti, of the so-called body of consciousness formed by the sound Om, and the bindu, point, implicit in the mantra – so'ham.
aṅgavaktrāṇi tasyaiva svasthāneṣu niyojayet | atha mātṛkayā prāgvattattattvasphuṭatātmakaḥ | tritattvanyāsatā cāsya pṛṣṭhe kakṣyātrayāgate | tato'ghorāṣṭakanyāsaḥ śirastaccaraṇātmakam |	The same is to be done in regard to the posing of the forces of the Mother Goddess. b- This is to be followed by the triple positing nyāsa including three significant points in the body including head, feet and heart amounting to the middlemost part of the body. Siva is to be posited in the head, eight agencies Aghora, Ghora, Ghoratara, Sarva, Rudra, Tatpurusa and Mahādeva in the heart and Nr in the feet.
tato'pi śivasadbhāvanyāsaḥ svāṃgasya saṃyutaḥ | itthaṃ kṛte pañcake'sminyattanmukhyatayā bhavet |	Then Śiva needs to be posited in different parts of his body by the student. By virtue of this kind of fivefold positing of the sense of Śiva in the body, his personality would become predominated by that sense.
upāsyamarcya tatsāṅgaṃ ṣaṣṭhe nyāse niyojayet | tenātra nyāsayogyo'sau bhagavānratiśekharaḥ |	The sixth positing lies in worshipping and praying to the deities concerned as embodied in those parts of the body amount to Lord Śiva as Ratisekhara Himself having been embodied in the form of the student.
ūrdhve nyāsyo navākhyasya mukhyatve'nyonyadhāmatā| evaṃ bhairavasadbhāvanāthe mukhyatayā yadi |	In this process of positing of the Divine in different parts of his body by the student, the top position needs to be accorded to Siva designated by nine names otherwise they all stand interspersed into one another.
upāsyatā tattatsthāne prāṅnyāsyo ratiśekharaḥ | itthaṃ śrīpūrvaśāstre me saṃpradāyaṃ nyarūpayat |	Being accorded the central position amongst all these divine agencies, the primacy of worship needs to be given to Him as Ratiśekhara.
śaṃbhunātho nyāsavidhau devo hi kathamanyathā | nyāse vivarjyate'muṣminnaṅgānyapyasya santi hi | mūrtiḥ sṛṣṭistritattvaṃ cetyaṣṭau mūrtyaṅgasaṃyutāḥ | śivaḥ sāṅgaśca vijñeyo nyāsaḥ ṣoḍhā prakīrtitaḥ |	- My teacher, Śambhunātha, however, has expressed his view in this regard concerning the negligence to Lord Siva Himself as an integral being in this system of positing, in spite of involvement of His accessories though. In his view, the positing of the Divine needs to be conducted as per the forms mūrti, creation srsti, the three essentials tritattva, accessories of the form, Siva along with His accessories and thus of six kinds.
asyopari tataḥ śāktaṃ nyāsaṃ kuryācca ṣaḍvidham | parāparāṃ savaktrāṃ prāktata prāgiti mālinīm |	Over and above this, the six kinds of positing needs to be done in regard to the Śakti as well.
paścātparāditritayaṃ śikhāhṛtpādagaṃ kramāt | tataḥ kavaktrakaṇṭheṣu hṛnnābhīguhyaūrutaḥ | jānupāde'pyaghoryādyaṃ tato vidyāṅgapañcakam | tatastvāvāhayecchaktiṃ mātṛsadbhāvarūpiṇīm | yogeśvarīṃ parāṃ pūrṇāṃ kālasaṃkarṣiṇīṃ dhruvām | aṅgavaktraparīvāraśaktidvādaśakādhikām | sādhyānuṣṭhānabhedena nyāsakāle smarehuruḥ |	-a Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation Positing should start with the Supreme Mother along with Her faces followed by that of Mālinī next to it. Then it should be done with reference to the three deities, namely, the Parā, the Aparā and the Parāparā in the order of their placement on the crest, heart and feet accordingly followed by the placement of eight deities named Aghorā on head, face, throat, heart, navel, genitals, thighs, shanks and feet. After this, should be invited motherly goddesses of goodwill known as Parā, Pūrnā and Kāla-karsini b-a Then the teacher needs to bring to his memory the twelve forces of Sakti in view of their different status on the ceremonial occasion known as Sādhya.
paraiva devītritayamadhye yābhedinī sthitā | sānavacchedacinmātrasadbhāveyaṃ prakīrtitā | sāraśāstre yāmale ca devyāstena prakīrtitaḥ |	b-a From amongst the three goddesses known as parā, aparā and parāparā, it is only the first one who remains constantly associated with the Lord as she is the infinity of consciousness and has been characterised as such in the Sāra Sāstra as well as the Yāmala.
mūrtiḥ savaktrā śaktiśca śaktitrayamathāṣṭakam| pañcāṅgāni parā śaktirnyāsaḥ śākto'pi ṣaḍvidhaḥ |	This Śākta positing, too, is considered to be of six kinds, namely, form, face, trinity of forces, eightfold Aghoras, placement on five points in the body, and that of the Supreme Force.
yāmalo'yaṃ mahānyāsaḥ siddhimuktiphalapradaḥ | muktyekārthī punaḥ pūrvaṃ śāktaṃ nyāsaṃ samācaret | |	This last one is conjugal and hence is considered to be of the highest category and is said to result in attainment of siddhi as well as liberation. The aspirant of only liberation needs to practice placing of Sakti.
guravastvāhuritthaṃ yannyāsadvayamudāhṛtam | mumukṣuṇāṃ tu pādādi tatkāryaṃ saṃhṛtikramāt |	b- My teachers have told me that from amongst the two kinds of placements, the aspirant of liberation should practise only the withdrawal mode of it which begins from the feet.
yāvantaḥ kīrtitā bhedāḥ śaṃbhuśaktyaṇuvācakāḥ | tāvatsvapyeṣu mantreṣu nyāsaḥ ṣoḍhaiva kīrtitaḥ | kiṃtvāvāhyastu yo mantraḥ sa tatrāṅgasamanvitaḥ| ṣaṣṭhaḥ syāditi sarvatra ṣoḍhaivāyamudāhṛtaḥ |	With regard to mantras relating to positing of Śiva, Sakti and the Individual Siva, Sakti, and Nara, it has been determined as of six kinds with this specification that the mantra used in the invitation of the deity concerned should be complete in all respects. This would form the sixth category of the placement as only six categories have been approved everywhere.
mudrāpradarśanaṃ paścātkāyena manasā girā| pañcāvasthā jāgradādyāḥ ṣaṣṭhyanuttaranāmikā | ṣaṭkāraṇaṣaḍātmatvātṣaṭtriṃśattattvayojanam | evaṃ ṣoḍhāmahānyāse kṛte viśvamidaṃ haṭhāt |	- States of consciousness are six, namely, waking, dreaming, sound sleeping, the fourth, the transcendent to the fourth with the addition of the Ultimate, known as anuttara consisting in the admittance of Sakti and Siva . These states being Detailed Deliberation on the Process of Initiation multiplied by six causes in the form of the Brahmarandhra, suşumnā, nādānta, bindu, Sakti and Śiva come up to thirty-six which is the total number of the constituent elements of the universe .
dehe tādātmyamāpannaṃ śuddhāṃ sṛṣṭiṃ prakāśayet | mūrtinyāsātsamārabhya yā sṛṣṭiḥ prasṛtātra sā | abhedamānīya kṛtā śuddhā nyāsabalakramāt |	Thus, on account of this magnanimous placement in the body of the aspirant, the entire universe happens to be compressed in his body resulting in its purification on the universal scale. - a Beginning with the placement of the forms mürti in the body of the student and ending in its oneness with the entire creation this process of nyāsa culminates in the purification of the creation as a whole.
tena ye'codayanmūḍhāḥ pāśadāhavidhūnane | | kṛte śānte śive rūḍhaḥ punaḥ kimavarohati | iti te dūrato dhvastāḥ paramārthaṃ hi śāṃbhavam |	b-a Therefore, those fools who seek to make fun of the cremation of the body after death as termination in nothingness, leaving nothing to descend in spite of the soul having merged into Siva in all His state of peace, they get demolished far from truth as oneness with Śiva is the ultimate goal of the individual.
na viduste svasaṃvittisphurattāsāravarjitāḥ| na khalveṣa śivaḥ śānto nāma kaścidvibhedavān | sarvetarādhvavyāvṛtto ghaṭatulyo'sti kutracit | mahāprakāśarūpā hi yeyaṃ saṃvidvijṛmbhate |	b- This sort of statement on their part is due to their ignorance of the secret of emergence of the dynamics of self-consciousness. As a matter of fact, Siva in His quietude is not an entity shorn of all way-outs something like a jar placed at a particular spot. Śiva, indeed, is the magnanimous brilliance of self-consciousness whose reflection is the expanse of the universe in all its entirety.
sa śivaḥ śivataivāsya vaiśvarūpyāvabhāsitā | tathābhāsanayogo'taḥ svarasenāsya jṛmbhate | | bhāsyamāno'tra cābhedaḥ svātmano bheda eva ca | bhede vijṛmbhite māyā māyāmāturvijṛmbhate |	-a This kind of reflectivity of Him in the form of the universe is dependent only on Himself and appears as such on account of its oneness with Him. Whatever difference of it appears from Him is really due to the knower being enclosed in māyā. On restoration of his oneness with Him, gets restored the essential Siva hood of the knower.
abhede jṛmbhate'syaiva māyāmātuḥ śivātmatā | māyāpramātā tadrūpavikalpābhyāsapāṭavāt |	b-a By virtue of the exercise of placement of Śiva within himself, the knower, otherwise enclosed in māyā, becomes Śiva.

ekavīraśikheśa śrīkaṇṭhāḥ kāle trayastraye | kālasya pūrvaṃ vinyāso niyaterabhidhīyate | |	In the texts like Ekavira Sikhā, Isa Śāstra and the School of Srikantha, Vidyā, Kalā and Rāga are accommodated in Kāla itself. They also hold the view that the place of Niyati is recommended prior to that of Kāla.
athavānyonyasaṃjñābhirvyapadeśo hi ddaśyate | evaṃ pumādiṣaṭtattvī vinyastāṣṭādaśāṅgule |	Mutual interchange of their denominations also are found alternately. Thus is completed assignment of six elements including the Purusa within a span of eighteen finger-ends.
tato'pyaṅguṣṭhamātrāntaṃ māyātattvasthamaṣṭakam | pratyekamadhāṅgulataḥ syādaṅgulacatuṣṭaye |	This is to be followed by assignment of eight elements of Māyā in the span of four finger-ends obviously each within half a finger-end, all of them spanning the length just of a thumb.
itthaṃ dvyakṣiṇa purāṇyaṣṭāviṃśatiḥ puruṣānniśi | puratrayaṃ dvayostryaṃśanyūnāṅgulamiti kramāt |	Thus gets completed the process of assignment of twenty-two factors related to Purusa and Māyā.
dvayordvayaṃ pañcapurī vaidyīye caturaṅgule | tata aiśapurāṇyaṣṭau catuṣke'rdhāṅgulakramāt |	Within the span of two finger-ends each get assigned two landmarks while within the same of four finger-ends are assigned five landmarks. Then eight landmarks related to Isvara get assigned within the span of four finger-ends at the rate of half a finger-end each.
tatastrīṇi dvaye dve ca dvayoritthaṃ catuṣṭaye | sādāśivaṃ pañcakaṃ syāditthaṃ vasvekakaṃ ravau | ṣoḍaśakaṃ rasaviśikhaṃ vasudvikaṃ vasuśaśīti puravargāḥ | vedā rasābdhi yugmākṣi ca ravayastatra cāṅgulāḥ kramaśaḥ |	Thus eighteen landmarks get accommodated within the range of just twelve finger-ends including five ones related to Sadāśiva. - In this way, the landmarks numbering sixteen, fifty-six, twenty-eight and eighteen get assigned gradually within the span of four, forty-six, twenty-two and twelve finger-ends respectively. Thus, landmarks number one hundred and eighteen get assigned within the span of eighty-four finger-ends which is the total length of the human body while Siva pervades the whole of it.
aṣṭādaśādhikaśataṃ purāṇi dehe'tra caturaśītimite | vinyastāni taditthaṃ śeṣe tu vyāpakaṃ śivaṃ tattvam |	The number of span rises to one hundred and eight with the addition of twenty-four finger-ends to it which is the highest category of it. There is the provision of addition in the number of the landmarks as related to the group of eight of Lakula, etc.
iti vidhiraparaḥ kathitaḥ parāparākhyo rasaśrutisthāne | aṣṭaśaraṃ saṃkhyānaṃ khamunikṛtaṃ tatpare vidhau jñeyam | |	Having completed the section recounting the system of assignment relating to landmarks bhuvana, now Abhinava proceeds to give details of the assignment of sounds to the points of the human body in all its three categories, namely, the lower, the lower-higher and the highest.
aparādividhitraitādatha nyāsaḥ padādhvanaḥ | pūrvaṃ daśapadī coktā svatantrā nyasyate yadā |	The assignment starts with the group of ten sounds which is autonomous. Initiation should be accomplished with the application of the same group of eight sounds.
tayaiva dīkṣā kāryā cettadeyaṃ nyāsakalpanā | tattvādimukhyatāyogāddīkṣāyāṃ tu padāvalī | | tattattvādyanusāreṇa tatrāntarbhāvyate tathā | svapradhānatvayoge tu dīkṣāyāṃ padapaddhatim | nyasyetkrameṇa tattvādivadanānavalokinīm |	The system of assignment in course of initiation and that of the assignment of the sounds to the points of the body itself have started depending on each other. Whatever assignment of sounds to the points of the body is done it follows the nature of the essence assigned to the point. The teacher needs to follow this system as per his choice since the entire act of assignment is dependent on him beginning from a review of the essences on the one hand and the face of the disciple on the other.
caturṣvaṣṭāsu cāṣṭāsu daśasvatha daśasvatha | | daśasvatho pañcadaśasvatha vedaśarenduṣu | dharāpadānnavapadīṃ mātṛkāmālinīgatām |	-a There are ten steps of assignment. The span of finger-ends involved in nine of them is as follows: four, eight, eight, ten, ten, ten, fifteen, four and fifteen. These nine steps cover the span from earth to mātrkā and mālini categories of sounds.
yojayedvyāptṛ daśamaṃ padaṃ tu śivasaṃjñitam | dharāpadaṃ varjayitvā pañca yāni padāni tu |	The tenth step of it gets completed with the addition of one related to Siva which, indeed, comprehends all these nine steps. b-a Except for earth whose span is four finger-ends the other five extend for twelve finger-ends each.
vidhidvayaṃ syānnikṣipya dvādaśa dvādaśāṅgulān | mantrādhvano'pyeṣa eva vidhirvinyāsayojane | | vyāptimātraṃ hi bhidyetetyuktaṃ prāgeva tattathā | varṇādhvano'tha vinyāsaḥ kathyate'tra vidhitraye | | eka caturṣu pratyekaṃ dvayoraṅṅgulayoḥ kramāt | trayoviṃśativarṇī syāt ṣaḍvarṇyakaikaśastriṣu |	b-a So far as the assignment of mantra is concerned, the same system is applicable to that one as well, with variation, however, in the range of the span which has already been pointed out. b-a Now, the system of assignment of letters in its three catégories i.e., lower, lower-higher and highest is being explained as follows: one in four finger-ends, four in two each, twenty-three together in ten finger-ends and lastly, and in the Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation remaining span of fifteen, four and fifteen finger-ends get assigned six letters in each category.
pratyekamatha catvāraścatuṣviti vilomataḥ | mālinīmātṛkārṇāḥ syūrvyāpta śaivaṃ rasendutaḥ | |	b- In the reversed system of assignment, by placement of four letters in each one of the four spans, the number of letters assigned comes together to sixteen. These sixteen letters related to mālini and mātrkā systems need to be regarded as related to Siva and hence comprehensive of all.
varjayitvādyavarṇaṃ tu tattvavatsyādravīravīn | tāṃ trayoviṃśatau varṇeṣvapyanyatsyādvidhidvayam | |	Leaving apart the first letter, the letters are counted in two classes each consisting of twelve ones in view of the essences. There should be applied another couple of systems for the distribution of these twenty three letters, that is, consisting of sixteen letters.
śrīpūrvaśāstre tenādau tattveṣūktaṃ vidhitrayam | atidiṣṭaṃ tu tadbhinnābhinnavarṇadvaye samam |	This is why in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra three kinds of assignments have been referred to in regard to essences and different kinds of orders applied in the arrangement of the letters in the mātrkā and mālinī alphabets.
dvividho'pi hi varṇānāṃ ṣaḍvidho bheda ucyate | tattvamārgavidhānena jñātavyaḥ paramārthataḥ |	In course of assignment of letters in view of the essences it is necessary to understand how they form six groups amongst them in keeping with the two systems each divided into three categories, namely, the highest, the higher- lower, and the low. These are their ultimate categories.
upadeśātideśābhyāṃ yaduktaṃ tatpadādiṣu | bhūyo'tidiṣṭaṃ tatraiva śāstre'smaddhṛdayeśvare |	Sri Tantrāloka Whatever has been pointed in regard to the assignment of letters, etc. in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra, the same has been recounted by me in my Tantrāloka.
padamantrakalādīnāṃ pūrvasūtrānusārataḥ | tritayatvaṃ prakurvīta tattvavarṇoktavartmanā |	As has been pointed out summarily in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra in regard to assignment of letters, mantras and kalās, etc., the teacher needs to follow the same system of three-foldness in course of initiation.
uktaṃ tatpadamantreṣu kalāsvatha nirūpyate | caturṣu rasavede dvāviṃśatau dvādaśasvatha | nivṛttyādyāścatasraḥ syurvyāptrī syācchāntyatītikā | dvitīyasyāṃ kalāyāṃ tu dvādaśa dvādaśāṅgulān |	-a There are four sections in the ordinary human body and are known as kalā, namely, nivrtti, pratisthā, vidyā and śānta. Letters as well as essences tattva in these sections are twenty-three each. The span of nivrtti kalā is four finger-ends, that of pratisthā is forty-six, that of vidyā is twenty-two while śānta is pervasive and is considered to extend for twelve and twelve finger-ends over and above this figure.
kramātkṣiptvā vidhidvaitaṃ parāparaparātmakam | caturaṇḍavidhistvādiśabdeneha pragṛhyate | |	b- In the process of assignment of letters and essences to the sections of the body in their threefold division, lower, lower-higher and highest, care has been taken of the four circles caturanda namely, that of the earth of prakrti prakrtyanda, of māyā and śakti.
kalācatuṣkavattena tasminvācyaṃ vidhitrayam | evaṃ ṣaḍvidhamadhvānaṃ śodhyaśiṣyatanau purā | |	-a Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation In this way, having followed the six-fold system of assignment of letters and essences to the body of the student, as per his choice, the teacher should think of assigning the mantras also.
śabdarāśirmālinī ca samastavyastato dvidhā | ekavīratayā yadvā ṣaṭka yāmalayogataḥ |	b- The alphabets and the mālinī both are of two kinds each in their intact and disintegrated forms. Besides these four divisions, two more get added to them in the forms of ekavira and yāmala.
pañcavaktrī śaktitadvadbhedātṣoḍhā punardvidhā | ekākiyāmalatvenetyevaṃ sā dvādaśātmikā |	Sakti is five-faceted. Including this facet of it, the six categories get multiplied by two on account of their disintegrated and conjugal forms taken into consideration. Thus, the number of the categories of letters grows to twelve.
ṣaḍaṅgī sakalānyatvādvividhā vaktravatpunaḥ | dvādaśatvena guṇitā caturviṃśatibhedikā |	These six categories have the possibility of being divisible sakala and indivisible niskala as was the case in relationship to the facets of the Sakti. Thus, the number twelve gets further multiplied by two raising the number of the categories to twenty-four.
aghorādyaṣṭake dve ca tṛtīyaṃ yāmalodayāt | mātṛsadbhāvamantraśca kevalaḥ śruticakragaḥ |	Group of mantras known as aghorāstaka, bhairavāstaka and saktyāstaka also have the possibility of their conjugal forms while the mantra addressed to the Sri Tantrāloka Mother for getting only Her goodwill being added to that number raises it to four.
ekadvitricaturbhedāttrayodaśabhidātmakaḥ | ekavīratayā so'yaṃ caturdaśatayā sthitaḥ | anāmasaṃhṛtisthairyatsṛṣṭicakraṃ caturvidham | devatābhirnijābhistanmātṛsadbhāvavṛṃhitam |	All these groups numbering one, two, three and four being combined come up to thirteen and with the addition of Ekavira to it, the number rises to fourteen.- Srsti-cakra circle of creation involves four stages, namely, creation, sustenance, dissolution and indescribable. These stages are maintained by the goodwill of their respective deities.
itthaṃ śodhakavargo'yaṃ mantrāṇāṃ saptatiḥ smṛtā | ṣaḍardhaśāstreṣu śrīmatsāraśāstre ca kathyate | |	Mantras relating to these stages are used in the course of initiation as purgatory and are seventy in number. This has been stated in the texts relating to Trika system as well as in the Sāra śāstra.
aghorādyaṣṭakeneha śodhanīyaṃ vipaścitā | athavaikākṣarāmantrairathavā mātṛkākramāt |	The knowledgeable teacher needs to perform the act of purification through mantras addressed to eight Bhairavas, namely, Aghora, etc. He may do the same through the monosyllabic mantras of even barely by mātrkās.
bhairavīyahṛdā vāpi khecarīhṛdayena vā | bhairaveṇa mahādevi tvatha vaktrāṅgapañcakaiḥ |	The same ceremony may be performed through bhairavi hrt mantras, khecari hrt mantra, any mantra addressed to anyone of the Bhairavas or even through address to five organs of the body.
yena yena hi mantreṇa tantre'sminnudbhavaḥ kṛtaḥ |	Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation Indeed, through whatever mantra of the system the beginning of the ceremony was started, the teacher may complete the task of initiation through that mantra itself.
tenaiva dīkṣayenmantrī ityājñā pārameśvarī |	This is what the Mother has observed.
evaṃ śodhakabhedena saptatiḥ kīrtitā bhidaḥ | śodhyanyāsaṃ vinā mantrairetairdīkṣā yadā bhaved | tadā saptavidhā jñeyā jananādivivarjitā| śodhyabhedo'tha vaktavyaḥ saṃkṣepātso'pi kathyate |	Thus, depending on the choice of the teacher, there are as many as seventy alternatives in regard to application of mantras in this context. In case of performance of the ceremony of initiation without assignment of these mantras to the student also the number of alternative methods remains the same and still the initiation proves effective in warding off the malady of birth, etc. - a Now the content of the act of purification also needs to be explained which is being given summarily as under.
ekatri pañcaṣaṭtriṃśatbhedāttāttvaścaturvidhaḥ | pañcaikabhedāccādhvānastathaivāṇḍacatuṣṭayam |	b Initiation in essence is of four kinds numbering one, three, five and thirty- six while the paths adhvan are six and so is the group of four circles anda.
evaṃ daśavidhaṃ śodhyaṃ triṃśaddhā tadvidhitrayāt | śodhyaśodhakabhedena śatāni tvekaviṃśatiḥ |	Thus, the number of contents to be purified is ten. On account of the method of purification being of three kinds this number grows to thirty.
atrāpi nyāsayogena śodhye'dhvani tathākṛteḥ | śataikaviṃśatibhidā jananādyujjhitā bhavet | jananādimayī tāvatyevaṃ śatadṛśi śrutiḥ | syātsaptatyadhikā sāpi dravyavijñānabhedataḥ | |	Again it rises to two thousand one hundred on account of the consideration of the distinction between the teacher and the taught. Sri Tantrāloka Here also, via application of the same principles of calculation to the process of assignment regarding the path of purification, another two thousand one hundred varieties come to the fore, which, too, are capable of making one transcend the malady of birth, etc.
dvidheti pañcāśītiḥ syācchatānyadhikakhābdhikā | bhogamokṣānusāndhānādvividhā sā prakīrtitā |	Through multiplication of this figure by two on account of the difference between the material and the consciousness used in course of the rite, the number would reach eight thousand five hundred and forty. This figure would again be doubled on account of variation in the objectives, namely, enjoyment and liberation.
aśubhasyaiva saṃśuddhayā śubhasyāpyatha śodhanāt | dvidhā bhoga śubhe śuddhiḥ kālatrayavibhedini |	- On account of difference in the purification of the inauspicious on one hand and the auspicious on the other, there arises difference in the states of enjoyment and liberation both which gets multiplied again in view of variation in the factor of time in its three states, namely, past, present and future.
ekadvisāmastyavaśātsaptadhetyaṣṭadhā bhujiḥ | guruśiṣyakramātso'pi dvidhetyevaṃ vibhidyate |	Enjoyment and liberation both may be differentiated into eight kinds in view of variation in time, three each, and their integral forms. The same again may be doubled in view of the difference between the teacher and the taught.
pratyakṣadīkṣaṇe yasmāddvayorekānusandhitaḥ | tāddagdīkṣāphalaṃ pūrṇaṃ visaṃvāde tu viplavaḥ |	- Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation In the act of initiation of the student present before the teacher face to face, since there is direct coordination between the two, the result would be perfect.
parokṣamṛtadīkṣādau gururevānusandhimān | kriyājñānamahimnā taṃ śiṣyaṃ dhāmnīpsite nayet |	In case of initiation in absentia due to death, etc. of the candidate, it is the teacher himself who has to play the role of the candidate also. By virtue of his will and wisdom he is expected to guide the soul of the departed to its desired objective.
avibhinne kriyājñāne karmaśuddhau tathaiva te | anusandhiḥ punarbhinnaḥ karma yasmāttadātmakam |	Action and knowledge are intertwined with each other. This is why in case of purification of action, both of them need to be taken care of.
śrīmatsvacchandaśāstre ca vāsanābhedataḥ phalam | śiṣyāṇāṃ ca guroścoktamabhinne'pi kriyādike | bhogasya śodhakācchodhyādanusandheśca tādṛśāt | vaicitryamasti bhedasya vaicitryaprāṇatā yataḥ|	It is the follow-up action which brings in difference in the result. It has been observed in the Svacchanda Tantra that difference in the result is due to passion as is obvious from the fact that in spite of uniformity of action, knowledge, etc. between the teacher and the taught, the result of the act of initiation varies from each other's. This is also true in regard to the quantum of enjoyment as well as the follow-up action of the act of initiation.
tathāhi vaktrairyasyādhvā śuddhastaireva yojitaḥ | bhoktumiṣṭe kvacittattve sa bhoktā tadbalānvitaḥ | śubhānāṃ karmaṇāṃ cātra sadbhāve bhogacitratā | tādṛgeva bhavetkarmaśuddhau tvanyaiva citratā |	In course of initiation as well as follow-up action of it, the teacher and the taught undergo almost identical processes, yet the result of the entire procedure is different on them. This is so because peculiarity is the spirit of difference. This point of peculiarity gets further elucidated by the fact that the mouths involved in the utterance of mantras remain the same in course of purification of the path of unification with the desired one, and yet the results are different. If one dies a sudden death, the remainder of his enjoyment would remain stuck to his subtle body.
bhogaśca sadyautkrāntyā dehenaivātha saṃgataḥ | tadaivābhyāsato vāpi dehānte vetyasau catuḥ |	The case would be obviously different with the person who would die a natural death as also with one who does so having undergone some spiritual practice. Thus, the results would be of four kinds.
prāktanāṣṭabhidā yogāddvātriṃśadbheda ucyate | mokṣa eko'pi bījasya samayākhyasya tādṛśam |	In the previous verse No. there was a reference to eight kinds of consequences of an action. If that number be multiplied by these four ones, the result would come up to thirty-two.
bālādikaṃ jñātaśīghramaraṇaṃ śaktivarjitam | vṛddhaṃ voddiśya śaktaṃ vā śodhanāśodhanādvidhā | |	Though fundamentally it is one and the same resulting from the performance of the rite of initiation, yet it gets divided into two on account of the fact of performance or non-performance of the rite of purification owing to the old age, incapability, etc. of the candidate.
sadyautkrāntitastraidhaṃ sā cāsannamṛtau guroḥ | kāryeṃtyājñā maheśasya śrīmadgahvarabhāṣitā | |	- Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation Besides these two basic variations in initiation, there is the third one created by incidence of death all of a sudden. On the occurrence of any such death, it is the teacher who needs to perform it. This has been stated by the Lord Himself in the Gahvara Sāstra.
dṛṣṭvā śiṣyaṃ jarāgrastaṃ vyādhinā paripīḍitam | utkramayya tatastvenaṃ paratattve niyojayet | |	Having seen his disciple suffering from old age and disease, the teacher needs to perform his initiation rite of rising above the bounds of the world so that he may be associated with the highest Essence.
pañcatriṃśadamī bhedā gurorvā guruśiṣyayoḥ | uktadvaividhyakalanātsaptatiḥ parikīrtitāḥ | |	These thirty-five kinds of initiations become seventy on account of the consideration of the two sides of the process as represented by the teacher and the taught.
etairbhedaiḥ puroktāṃstānbhedāndīkṣāgatānguruḥ | hatvā vadetprasaṃkhyānaṃ svabhyastajñānasiddhaye |	It is necessary for the teacher to explain to the disciple how this figure of the kinds of initiation was reached so that his knowledge of it gets revised as also be popularised.
pañcāśītiśatī yā catvāriṃśatsamuttarā kathitā | tāṃ saptatyā bhittvā dīkṣābhedānsvayaṃ kalayet | |	If the kinds of initiation recounted earlier as eight thousand five hundred and forty were to be multiplied by this figure that is, seventy, the result would automatically become obvious.
pañcakamiha lakṣāṇāṃ ca saptanavatiḥ sahasraparisaṃkhyā | aṣṭau śatāni dīkṣābhedo'yaṃ mālinītantre | |	This figure of the kinds of initiation has been given in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra as five lakh ninety seven thousand and eight hundred ,.
saptatidhā śoddhṛgaṇastriśaddhā śodhya ekatattvādiḥ | sāṇḍaḥ ṣaḍadhvarūpastathetikartavyatā caturbhedā |	Seventy kinds of the agent of purification, thirty kinds of the position of the object of purification, varieties of the essences beginning from one, the four circles anda, six paths and their four varieties, processes of substance and their knowledge which are preventive of getting subjected to birth, etc.
dravyajñānamayī sā jananādivivarjitātha taduktā| pañcatriṃśaddhā punareṣā bhogāpavargasandhānāt | |	and the consequent state of being all taken together come to the number thirty-five. Apart from these there are the points of diversification caused via differentiation between the states of enjoyment and liberation.
yasmāddvātriṃśaddhā bhogaḥ śubhaśuddhyaśuddhikālabhidā| mokṣastredhā dviguṇā saptatiritikāryatābhedāḥ |	Besides these, there are thirty- two kinds caused by the nature of these states as auspicious, pure and impure. Over and above these, there are three kinds of liberation. All these taken together reach the number thirty-five the same figure being multiplied by two makes the number reach seventy.
śodhanaśodhyavibhedāditikartavyatvabhedataścaiṣā| dīkṣā bahudhā bhinnā śodhyavihīnā tu saptatidhā |	- Initiation gets further diversified manifold on account of consideration about it in view of the difference between the process of purification and the object of it besides the procedure of its performance, leaving apart the seventy kinds of it in the absence of the subject of purification.
mantrāṇāṃ sakaletarasāṅganiraṅgādibhedasaṃkalanāt | śodhyasya ca tattvādeḥ pañcadaśādyuktabhedaparigaṇanāt |	Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation Besides these, there is a multitude of kinds created through consideration of the nature of mantras such as sakala, niskala, sānga, niranga, etc. and the calculation of the fifteen kinds emerging from the counting of the number of objects of purification such as essences, etc.
bhedanāṃ parigaṇanā na śakyate kartumityasaṃkīrṇāḥ | bhedāḥ saṃkīrṇāḥ punaranye bhūyastvakāriṇo bahudhā | śodhakaśodhyādīnāṃ dvitrādivibhedasadbhāvāt | bhoge sādhye yadyadbahukartavyaṃ tadāśrayenmatimān |	Thus, the calculation of all kinds of initiation becomes practically unmanageable in view of its excessiveness. Besides these, there are innumerably many more kinds which have remained unaccounted for so long, such as those which concern the kinds relating to the difference between the subject and the object of the act of purification which have the possibility of doubling and even trebling the figure.
kāraṇabhūyastvaṃ kila phalabhūyastvāya kiṃ citram | apavarge natu bhedastenāsminvāsanādṛḍhatvajuṣā |	- There is nothing strange in the yield of profusion of result out of profusion of the cause as regards the case of the objective of enjoyment .
apavarge'pi hi vistīrṇakarmavijñānasaṃgrahaḥ kāryaḥ | cidvṛttervaicitryāccāñcalye'pi krameṇa sandhānāt |	In the case of liberation, however, since the result is uniformly one depending on firmness of the resolve, a small quantum of effort is sufficient to yield the result, or even sheer access to the level of the consciousness concerned.
tasmiṃstasminvastuni rūḍhiravaśyaṃ śivātmikā bhavati | tattvamidametadātmakametasmātproddhṛto mayā śiṣyaḥ |	-a Sri Tantrāloka From within all the unsteadiness of the curvature of consciousness, if anyone happens to fix it to a certain objective, that objective whatsoever is sure to become Śiva itself. It is with this psychology that I have tried to impress the student.
itthaṃ kramasaṃvitau mūḍho'pi śivātmako bhavati | kramikatathāvidhaśivatānugrahasubhagaṃ ca daiśikaṃ paśyan |	Proceeding along this psychology, even a fool can get transformed into Siva.
śiśurapi tadabhedadṛśā bhaktibalāccābhyupaiti śivabhāvam | yadyapi vikalpavṛtterapi mokṣaṃ dīkṣayaiva dehānte | śāstre provāca vibhustathāpi dṛḍhavāsanā yuktā| mokṣe'pyasti viśeṣaḥ kriyālpabhūyastvajaḥ salokādiḥ |	Seeing the teacher proceeding along this psychological technique, even a child following the same technique exactly as such by the force of his devotion can attain Siva-hood. If there is a disciple whose mind has not been able to get rid of options, he, too, can attain liberation by means of initiation though only after his death. In any case, even then, steadiness of devotion is necessary for attaining liberation, as has been pointed out by the Lord as is obvious from the text.
iti kecittadayuktaṃ sa vicitro bhoga eva kathitaḥ syāt | saṃskāraśeṣavartanajīvitamadhye'sya samayalopādyam |	b-a Some authorities hold that depending on inadequacy and sufficiency of the action meant for the attainment of the state of liberation, there is gradation in the attainment of it such as attaining the status of the same world prior to becoming one with Him.
nāyāti vighnajālaṃ kriyābahutvaṃ mumukṣostat | yasmāt sabījadīkṣāsaṃskṛtapuruṣasya samayalopādye | bhukte bhogānmokṣo naivaṃ nirbījadīkṣāyām | iti kecinmanyante yuktaṃ taccāpi yatsmṛtaṃ śāstre |	b-a It is only those who have been imparted seeded initiation who have to wait for finishing the residue of impressions, getting rid of the blemishes of transgression of the code of conduct, sufficiency of action and enjoying the remainder of joys. This does not hold in the case of seedless initiation. In this state of difference Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation of opinion presented by a few, what is decisive is the view of the śāstra.
samayollaṅghanādevi kravyādatva śataṃ samāḥ |	- On account of transgression of the code of conduct, O Goddess, observes Siva one has to suffer the life of the eater of raw flesh for one hundred years.
tasmādguruśiṣyamatau śivabhāvanirūḍhivitaraṇasamartham | kramikaṃ tattvoddharaṇādi karma mokṣe'pi yuktamativitatam |	Therefore, it is imperative for the teacher and the taught both that they promote the idea of the necessity of maintaining the purity of consciousness by focusing on Siva-hood as the way to liberation.
yastu sadā bhāvanayā svabhyastajñānavānguruḥ sa śiśoḥ | apavargāya yathecchaṃ yaṃ kaṃcidupāyamanutiṣṭhet |	- The teacher who has become wise by virtue of his effort to develop the sense of Siva-hood in him, he is free to take to any means for the inculcation of the sense of liberation in the student.
evaṃ śiṣyatanau śodhyaṃ nyasyādhvānaṃ yathepsitam | śodhakaṃ mantramupari nyasyettattvānusārataḥ |	Thus, having assigned the proper path to the body of the disciple as desired by him, he should also assign the purifying mantra to him over and above the path in keeping with the essence required for his liberation.
dvayormātṛkayostattvasthityā varṇakramaḥ purā | kathitastaṃ tathā nyasyettattattattvaviśuddhaye |	I have already explained the sequence of letters in both the systems of the alphabet known as mātrkā and mālinī in keeping with the states of the essence.
varṇādhvā yadyapi proktaḥ śodhyaḥ pāśātmakastu saḥ | māyīya śodhakastvanyaḥ śivātmā paravāṅmayaḥ | |	Though the path of letters has been said to be subject to purification, as it lies within the range of fetters of māyā and is bound by it, yet what acts as the element of purification is its transcendental form of sound which, indeed, is Śiva.
uvāca sadyojyotiśca vṛttau svāyambhuvasya tat | bāḍhameko hi pāśātmā śabdo'nyaśca śivātmakaḥ |	Sadyojyoti has pointed out in the commentary, known as Svāyamva Vrtti, that, no doubt, sound is bound by fetters in one aspect but in the other it is one with Siva.
tasmāttasyaiva varṇasya yuktā śodhakaśodhyatā | śrīpūrvaśāstre cāpyuktaṃ te tairāliṅgitā iti | |	Therefore, it is proper to suggest that it is purifying as well as subject to purification.
sadyojātādivaktrāṇi hṛdādyaṅgāni pañca ca | ṣaṭkṛtvo nyasya ṣaṭtriṃśannyāsaṃ kuryāddharāditaḥ |	-a It has been stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra that all the thirty-four consonants are in union with the sixteen vowels as related to Śakti and Rudra respectively.
parāparāyā vailomyāddharāyāṃ syātpadatrayam | tato jalādahaṅkāre pañcāṣṭakasamāśrayāt | padāni pañca dhīmūlapuṃrāgākhye traye trayam | ekaṃ tvaśuddhavitkāladvaye caika niyāmake | kalāmāyādvaye caikaṃ padamuktamiha kramāt | vidyeśvarasadāśaktiśiveṣu padapañcakam |	b- Due to contrariety between the higher and the lower forms of assignment, in the assignment of the earth three words need to be used are phat, hah and hum followed by assignment of phat, ra, ra, ru, ru, he, piba to water, light, air, space, manas, senses, intellect, and ego these eight elements repeating five times. Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation By assignment of the mantra, namely, vama, bhisana, bhime, to intellect, prakrti and purusa-rāga thrice these elements become purified. Through assignment of the mantra ghoramukhi to avidyā and kāla these two factors get purified.
ekonaviṃśatiḥ seyaṃ padānāṃ syātparāparā|	As regards the factor of niyati, the mantra purificatory of it is the monosyllabic hah.
sārdhaṃ caika caika sārdhaṃ dve dve śaśī dṛgatha yugmam | trīṇi dṛgabdhiścandraḥ śrutiḥ śaśī pañca vidhumahaścandrāḥ | ekānnaviṃśatau syādakṣarasaṃkhyā padeṣviyaṃ devyāḥ |	The purifying mantra of Vidyā, Iśvara, Sadāśiva, Sakti and Śiva, these five factors of pure nature is hum paramaghore hrih aghore om which consists of five words, nineteen syllables and includes both the ranges, namely, the higher and the lower. -a Thus, this goddess of mantra consists of nineteen syllables in all which count as one and a half, one and a half, two and a half, two and a half, one, two, three, two, four, one, five, one and one.
haldvayayutavasucitraguparisaṃkhyātasvavarṇāyāḥ | mūlāntaṃ sārdhavarṇaṃ syānmāyāntaṃ varṇamekakam | śaktyantamekamaparānyāse vidhirudīritaḥ | māyāntaṃ haltataḥ śaktiparyante svara ucyate |	b- This entire mantra in its reversed form reads as follows: phat huh hum phat rara ruru he piba, vam bhisane bhime, ghoramukhi hah, ghora rūpe hum paramaghore hrih aghore om. This mantra is forty-syllabic including two pure consonants and eight plus two plus other letters out of which earth as the base is represented by one and a half letters while others up to māyā are represented by each one of the letters including the vowels.
niṣkale śivatattve vai paro nyāsaḥ paroditaḥ | parāparāpadānyeva hyaghoryāṣṭakadvaye |	- The higher category of assignment relates to Siva in His absolutely pure form while the higher-lower combined is represented by the two group of eight each.
mantrāstadanusāreṇa tattveṣvetaddvayaṃ kṣipet | piṇḍākṣarāṇāṃ sarveṣāṃ varṇasaṃkhyā vibhedataḥ | | avyaktāntaṃ svare nyasya śeṣaṃ śeṣeṣu yojayet | bījāni sarvatattveṣu vyāptṛtvena prakalpayet | piṇḍānāṃ bījavannyāsamanye tū pratipedire | akṛte vātha śodhyasya nyāse vastubalāt sthiteḥ |	Both these kinds of mantras should be assigned accordingly to the factors of the Reality keeping in mind the number of letters on the one side and the factors of the Reality on the other distinctly. - Having assigned the letter ma amongst the vowels, that is, the letter u, the rest of the vowels such as ya, ra, la, va should be assigned to the Purusa and others while the seed letters in both higher and lower categories should be treated as worthy of assigning to all the elements comprehensively. Some scholars have contended in regard to the assignment of conjunct consonants as seed-letters and that all whatever needs to be purified become purified by sheer assignment of the purificatory letters.
śodhakanyāsamātreṇa sarvaṃ śodhyaṃ viśudhyati | śrīmanamṛtyuñjayādau ca kathitaṃ parameṣṭhinā |	This has been stated by Lord Śiva Himself in texts like Mrtyunjaya, etc. - Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation Thus, by virtue of sheer assignment of the purificatory letter, get purified all the entities in existence.
adhunā nyāsamātreṇa bhūtaśuddhiḥ prajāyate | dehaśuddhyarthamapyetattulyametena vastutaḥ | |	From this observation it becomes obvious that this formula may be applied to the problem of purification of the body also equally well.
anyaprakaraṇoktaṃ yadyuktaṃ prakaraṇāntare | jñāpakatvena sākṣādvā tatkiṃ nānyatra guhyate | mālinīmātṛkāṅgasya nyāso yo'rcāvidhau purā | proktaḥ kevalasaṃśoddhṛmantranyāse sa eva tu |	A statement applicable to any other context, no matter, as a reminder or in direct application, why is it not acceptable in someone else ? Assignment of the units of mālini and mātrkā, these two kinds of alphabetical series in the process of worship has already been recounted. This kind of assignment is concerned only with what is purifying.
tripadī dvayordvayoḥ syātpratyekamathāṣṭasu śrutipadāni | dikcandracandrarasaraviśaraśaradṛgdṛṅamṛgāṅkaśaśigaṇane | | aṅgulamāne devyā aṣṭādaśa vaibhavena padamanyat | aparaṃ mānamidaṃ syāt kevalaśodhakamanunyāse |	In this assignment of the desolatory process, two group of three letters each get assigned in spaces of two finger-ends each, thus in a span of forty-nine finger- ends get assigned eighteen letters as so powerful these are on account of having been enforced by the Goddess. -a This assignment needs to be combined as of the lower nature. As distinct from it is the higher-lower assignment which begins from four letters to six.
turyapadātpadaṣaṭke mānadvitayaṃ parāparaparākhyam | dvādaśakaṃ dvādaśakaṃ tattvopari pūrvavattvanyat | |	As regards the system of assignment in case of the higher kind, it extends for twelve finger- ends each twice on the constituents of the Reality, as has been explained earlier.
kevalaśodhakamantranyāsābhiprāyato mahādevaḥ | tattvakramoditamapi nyāsaṃ punarāha tadviruddhamapi | |	b- Sri Tantrāloka Only from the viewpoint of assignment of barely purificatory mantras Lord Siva has recounted the assignment of the essences explained already again, though contrary to the former one.
niṣkale padamekārṇaṃ yāvatrīṇi tu pārthive | ityādinā tattvagatakramanyāsa udīritaḥ |	He has recounted the process of assignmentinregard to the spotofblemishlessness in terms of only one letter and that in the range of the earthly in terms of three steps.
punaśca mālinītantre vargavidyāvibhedataḥ | dvidhā padānītyuktvākhyannyāsamanyādṛśaṃ vibhuḥ |	In the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra, having described the method of assignment in a twofold manner, that is, in keeping with the distinction between the group of letters on the one hand and the vidyā on the other, the Lord has now stated it in a different way here in this context.
ekaikaṃ dvyaṅgulaṃ jñeyaṃ tatra pūrvaṃ padatrayam | aṣṭāṅgulāni catvāri daśāṅgulamataḥ param |	That way is as follows: The span of first three steps is of two finger-ends each followed by four of the span of eight each, then one of ten finger-ends' span, two of two finger-ends each and the next of two finger-ends.
vidyādvayaṃ śiṣyatanau vyāptṛtvenaiva yojayet | iti darśayituṃ nāsya pṛthaṅnyāsaṃ nyarūpayat |	- Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation The two vidyās, that is the pure and the impure, should be treated as pervasive of the entire body. This is why assignment has not been detailed out here separately.
evaṃ śodhakamantrasya nyāse tadraśmiyogataḥ | pāśajālaṃ vilīyeta taddhyānabalato guroḥ |	In this way, the teacher needs to assign the purificatory mantra to the body of the student which by means of the ray of the light of consciousness lying embedded in it, via meditation on it, may burn the net of fetters which has kept him bound until this stage.
śodhyatattve samastānāṃ yonīnāṃ tulyakālataḥ | jananādbhogataḥ karmakṣaye syādapavṛktatā | |	Since the entire group of six factors, namely, kalā, tattva, bhuvana, varna, pada and mantra needing to be purified is of common origin, it is only through sufferance that consequences of actions may get eliminated leading to redemption.
dehaistāvadbhirasyāṇościtraṃ bhokturapi sphuṭm | mano'nusandhirno viśvasaṃyogapravibhāgavat | niyatyā manaso dehamātre vṛttistataḥ param | nānusandhā yataḥ saikasvāntayuktākṣakalpitā | | pradeśavṛtti ca jñānamātmanastatra tatra tat | bhogyajñānaṃ nānyadeheṣvanusandhānamarhati | |	Since the same soul goes on assuming and leaving several bodies getting associated with as many minds on its path of the circle of birth and death, the sense of continuity of awareness does not remain intact throughout as is the case with the sense of continuity in the midst of discontinuity as well as continuity in the nature of the universe. The Nature has designed things in such a way that in spite of the all-pervading character of the Self the mind keeps its operation limited to its particular body keeping everything else in abeyance as is elucidated by the fact of its attending to only one of the senses at any instance.
yadā tu manasastasya dehavṛtterapi dhruvam | yogamantrakriyādeḥ syādvaimalyaṃ tadvidā tadā |	When, however, the mind becomes purged of all limitations of the body by means of yogic practice, use of mantra and the force of kriyā-yoga, etc., then it becomes conscious of the incidents of his previous lives also.
yathāmalaṃ mano dūrasthitamapyāśu paśyati | tathā pratyayadīkṣāyāṃ tattadbhuvanadarśanam | jananādiviyuktāṃ tu yadā dīkṣāṃ cikīrṣati | tadāsmāduddharāmīti yuktamūhaprakalpanam | |	As the purified mind quickly observes whatever is existing or happening at even a considerably distant place, even so in course of initiation in concepts and ideas concerning the different states of being in other dimensions of creation the candidate has the privilege of perceiving objects and events relating to them. When he aspires for such an initiation which may relieve him of the phenomenon of life and death, in course of his desire for getting relieved of the relevant states of being, he happens to visualise those states of being rather practically.
yadā śodhyaṃ vinā śoddhṛnyāsastatrāpi mantrataḥ | jananādikramaṃ kuryāttattvasaṃśleṣavarjitam | |	Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation In case of assignment of the means of purification in the absence of the object of it, particularly via mantra, the teacher needs to take care of the processes of birth and death in spite of their absence in actuality.
ekākiśoddhṛnyāse ca jananādivivarjane | tacchoddhṛsaṃpuṭaṃ nāma kevalaṃ parikalpayet |	In case of assignment of the paths to the teacher alone without any reference to birth and death, etc. the process needs to be considered as relevant to him and the disciple together.
dravyayogena dīkṣāyāṃ tilājyākṣatataṇḍulam | tattanmantreṇa juhuyāñjanmayogaviyogayoḥ | yadā vijñānadīkṣāṃ tu kuryācchiṣyaṃ tadā bhṛśam | tanmantrasaṃjalpabalāt paśyedā cāvikalpakāt |	In course of initiation, oblation of tila, sesame seeds, ghrta and rice needs to be put into the fire along with recitation of relevant mantras in the name of shift from the old name of the disciple to his new name as combined with that of the teacher. While imparting initiation to the student in the core wisdom, the teacher needs to look at him as getting transported from the state of options to that of optionlessness amounting to realisation by virtue of having reached his own level of consciousness on account of the effect of the mantra operating on him.
vikalpaḥ kila saṃjalpamayo yatsa vimarśakaḥ | mantrātmāsau vimarśaśca śuddho'pāśavatātmakaḥ |	Option in this case lies in its conversational nature which in any case is the pre-lingual conceptualisation and hence is bound by the fetters of animality while the agent of it is inspired by the mantra acting as his Self. As such, his contemplation is purified and rid of that fetter.
nityaścānādivaradaśivābhedopakalpitaḥ | tadyogāddaiśikasyāpi vikalpaḥ śivatāṃ vrajet |	Sri Tantrāloka That contemplation is eternal, primeval and benedictory of boon on account of having been originated from the consciousness of the agent's oneness with Siva and hence potent enough to make the option of the teacher also get upgraded to Śiva-hood.
śrīsāraśāstre tadidaṃ parameśena bhāṣitam | arthasya pratipattiryā grāhyagrāhakarūpiṇī |	In the Sāra śāstra, it has been stated by Lord Śiva Himself that the power embedded in the mantra is the awareness of the sense of understanding between the subject and the object of it transmitted to the chain of the mantra.
sā eva mantraśaktistu vitatā mantrasantatau | parāmarśasvabhāvetthaṃ mantraśaktirudāhṛtā | |	- a Thus, the power of mantra is said to be of the nature of communication which divides mantras into two, the pure and the impure on account of both these characters being inherent in the communication itself.
parāmarśo dvidhā śuddhāśuddhatvānmantrabhedakaḥ | ukta śrīpauṣkare'nye ca brahmaviṣṇvādayo'ṇḍagāḥ |	b-a It has been observed in the Pauskara śāstra that apart from Siva, gods like Brahmā, Visnu, etc.
prādhānikāḥ sāñjanāste sāttvarājasatāmasāḥ | tairaśuddhaparāmarśāttanmayībhāvito guruḥ |	presiding over their respective circles of being, act under the effect of the three substantive attributes, namely sattva, rajas and tamas, On account of the impurity lingering with these gods, the teacher devoted to Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation them becomes affected by that impurity.
vaiṣṇavādiḥ paśuḥ prokto na yogyaḥ patiśāsane | ye mantrāḥ śuddhamārgasthā śivabhaṭṭārakādayaḥ | śrīmanmataṅgādidṛyā tanmayo hi guruḥ śivaḥ |	Therefore, the Vaisnavas are said to lie under fetters hence are unworthy of following the discipline of Saivism. On the other hand, those mantras which are related to the path of purity, such as Sivabhattāraka, etc., as Matanga Sāstra has indicated, make the teacher filled with the sense of identity with Siva.
nanu svatantrasaṃjalpayogādastu vimarśitā |	b-a Now, it needs to be accepted that contemplation has been caused via communication.
prākkutaḥ sa vimarśāccetkutaḥ so'pi nirūpaṇe | ādyastathāvikalpatvapradaḥ syādupadeṣṭṛtaḥ | | yaḥ saṃkrānto'bhijalpaḥ syāttasyāpyanyopadeṣṭṛtaḥ | pūrvapūrvakramāditthaṃ ya evādiguroḥ purā |	This acceptance, however, gives rise to another question as to the source of the content of the communication which must be in the form of wisdom communicated by some teacher. Proceeding along this course of investigation backward from the recipient to the source of wisdom, one is sure to reach the primeval Teacher whose wisdom having been communicated at that initial state of being continues to prevail even until now.
yastathāvidhasaṃjalpabalātko'pi svatantrakaḥ |	b-a The contemplation caused by this kind of communication is sure to remain exactly the same as the original on account of the force of communication itself.
vimarśaḥ kalpyate so'pi tadātmaiva suniścitaḥ | ghaṭakumbha itītthaṃ vā yadi bhedo nirūpyate |	Whatever change occurs in course of communication and reception is like substitution of ghata by kumbha.
śabdācchabdāntare tena vyutpattirvyavadhānataḥ |	Since both these words mean one and the same thing, that is, the jar, other points of difference, need to be ignored deliberately.
yāvadbālasya savittirakṛtrimavimarśane | tena tanmantraśabdārthaviśeṣotthaṃ vikalpanam | | śabdāntarotthādbhedena paśyatā mantra ādṛtaḥ | yaccāpi bījapiṇḍāderuktaṃ prāgbodharūpakam | tattasyaiva kuto'nyasya tatkasamādanyakalpanā | etadarthaṃ guroryalāllakṣaṇe tatra tatra tat |	The option underlying in this case is like one lying in pāni and kara both meaning one and Sri Tantrāloka the same hand despite the difference in their derivations amounting to its use in the case of the former in business transactions while in the latter in just doing anything whatsoever without any kind of limitation to the task. b-a In the substitution of the synonym of a particular word, the obstruction in the task of understanding the sense lies in the derivations of the words concerned. That obstruction is rendered ineffective by going back to the actual object meant by the words.
lakṣaṇaṃ kathitaṃ hyeṣa mantratantraviśāradaḥ | tena mantrārthaṃsaṃbodhe mantravārtikamādarāt |	b-a Therefore, whatever be the reflection arising out of consideration of the meaning of the words of mantras, particularly of the nature of seed-words, conveys basically the old sense itself to have been assigned to it in the beginning.
ūpārohaprayogaṃ vā sarvathā gururācaret |	As such, it is unnecessary to think of it otherwise.
mantrārthavidabhāve tu sarvathā mantratanmayam | | guruṃ kuryāt tadabhyāsāttatsaṃkalpamayo hyasau | tatsamānābhisaṃjalpo yadā mantrārthabhāvanāt | gurorbhavettadā sarvasāmye ko bheda ucyatām | aṃśenāpyatha vaiṣamye na tato'rthakriyā hi sā |	b-a In case of unavailability of a teacher conversant with the meaning of mantras, the disciple needs to take resort to some such a person as his teacher who might have become one with the mantra by virtue of his contemplation on its nature. b-a If anyone can attain the same status as a teacher by only contemplation on the meaning of the mantra, please explain to me what will distinguish him from the real teacher. b-a Despite the difference between the two being just partial, words of one who is sheer contemplator on the sense of mantras cannot produce the effect of the mantra itself.
gomayātkīṭataḥ kīṭa ityevaṃ nyāyato yadā | saṃjalpāntarato'pyarthaṃkriyāṃ tāmeva paśyati |	This can be elucidated by the difference between the two kinds of insects such as one produced out of the animal's dung on the one side and that produced out of an insect on the other.
tadaiṣa satyasaṃjalpaḥ śiva eveti kathyate | sa yadvakti tadeva syānmantro bhogāpavargadaḥ |	Ignoring the difference between the two insects representing the meaning of the original mantra on one hand and that as communicated through words has been regarded as Śiva Himself. Whatever he speaks needs to be considered as mantra capable of granting both joy and liberation.
naiṣo'bhinavaguptasya pakṣo mantrārpitātmanaḥ | yo'rthakriyāmāha bhinnāṃ kīṭayorapi tādṛśo |	- This position is not one as held by Abhinavagupta himself as devoted completely to mantra. It, indeed, is kindred to the comparison between the two kinds of insects in regard to its effect.
mantrārpitamanāḥ kiṃcidvadanyattu viṣaṃ haret | tanmantra eva śabdaḥ saḥ paraṃ tatra ghaṭādivat |	Whatever the sorcerer may utter with complete devotion to the sense of the words concerned and proving to be effective in nullifying the effect of the poison, needs to be considered as mantra irrespective of all the discordance of the words used in it. The word used by him in this instance becomes paramount as becomes the word ghata, etc.
kāntāsaṃbhogasaṃjalpasundaraḥ kāmukaḥ sadā | tatsaṃskṛto'pyanyadeṣa kurvansvātmani tṛpyati | tathā tanmantrasaṃjalpabhāvito'nyadapi bruvan | anicchurapi tadrūpastathā kāryakārī dhruvam |	Just as an amorous person immediately after having sensual relationship with his beloved and thus having got impassioned by the act finds satisfaction in anything whatsoever he does under the spell of it, even so the sorcerer under the spell of his contemplation on the sense of his mantra may inadvertently utter even any other word instead of his usual one, and yet is sure to be effective in his act.
vikalpayannapyekārthaṃ yato'nyadapi paśyati | viṣāpahārimantrādītyuktaṃ śrīpūrvaśāsane |	- Just as what happens in the case of the amorous person or the sorcerer, the person who is inspired by the idea of Śiva-hood, though engaged in the thinking of something else may happen to see practically something else. This has been stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra via reference to the mantra of the sorcerer.
yadi vā viṣanāśe'pi hetubhedādvicitratā | dhātvāpyāyādikānantakāryabhedādbhaviṣyati |	Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation If there is some peculiarity in the subsidence of the effect of the poison through use of mantras seemingly irrelevant in their wording, the same is expected to happen in the case of the effect of the transmission of the emotion of the novice teacher on the component elements of the body.
tadedaṃ mantrasaṃjalpavikalpābhyāsayogataḥ bhāvyavastusphuṭībhāvaḥ saṃjalpahāsayogataḥ |	Thus, it is the essence of the object which makes the object manifest itself to the aspirant and by no means the transmission of the mantra.
vastveva bhāvayatyeṣa na saṃjalpamimaṃ punaḥ | guhṇāti bhāsanopāyaṃ bhāte tatra tu tena kim | | evaṃ saṃjalpanirhāse suparisphuṭatātmakam | akṛtrimavimarśātma sphuredvastvavikalpakam | |	If so, the question arises as to the utility of the transmission of the mantra itself. In response to this doubt, the author's reply is as under : When the effect of the transmission becomes subsided, the optionless final result makes itself out automatically. The Reality transcendent to all kinds of options which reveals itself as a follow- up of subsidence of all actions undertaken with aspiration for it is the essence of all whatever.
viśeṣatastvamāyīyaśivatābhedaśālinaḥ | mokṣe'bhyupāyaḥ saṃjalpo bandhamokṣau tataḥ kila |	Communication between the teacher and the taught resulting in the Self's oneness with Śiva is the way to liberation redeeming him from bondage.
vikalpe'pi guroḥ samyagabhinnaśivatājuṣaḥ | avikalpakaparyantapratīkṣā nopayujyate |	Since the teacher has already attained absolute oneness with Siva, to think of the precondition of the taught's attainment of the state of optionlessness prior to his redemption is improper.
tadvimarśasvabhāvā hi sā vācyā mantradevatā | mahāsaṃvitsamāsannetyuktaṃ śrīgamaśāsane | |	It has been stated in the Srigama śāstra that since the deity of the mantra is fully absorbed in the supernal consciousness, contemplation is its inherent nature.
nikaṭasthā yathā rājñāmanyeṣāṃ sādhayantyalam | siddhiṃ rājopagāṃ śīghramevaṃ mantrādayaḥ parām |	Just as those close to a king solve problems of anyone to his full satisfaction on behalf of the king quite quickly, even so do mantra, etc.
uktābhiprāyagarbhaṃ taduktaṃ śrīmālinīmate | mantrāṇāṃ lakṣaṇaṃ kasmādityukte munibhiḥ kilaḥ |	The Mālinivijayottara Tantra points out to the same truth via reference to the characteristic function of mantras as happened to have been asked by sages long in the past.
yogamekatvamicchanti vastuno'nyena vastunā | tadvastu jñeyamityuktaṃ heyatvādiprasiddhaye |	Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation Yoga is the unification of one thing with the other. That object which is sought to be united with needs to be understood so that the aspirant may get rid of his inclination towards things other than that.
tatprasiddhyai śivenoktaṃ jñānaṃ yadupavarṇitam | sabījayogasaṃsiddhyai mantralakṣaṇamapyalam | |	In order to fulfil that aspiration of the aspirant, whatever Śiva has stated is the knowledge available through mantra and is sufficient for attaining the state of seeded samadhi absorption.
na cādhikāritā dīkṣāṃ vinā yoge'sti śāṅkare | kriyājñānavibhedena sā ca dvedhā nigadyate | | dvividhā sā prakartavyā tena caitadudāhṛtam | naca yogādhikāritvamekamevānayā bhavet |	As regards the yoga of oneness with Sankara, anyone cannot enter into it without initiation which is said to be of two kinds, namely, one through the yoga of action and the other through that of knowledge. Initiation needs to be undergone in a twofold manner and without having taken up anyone has no possibility of practising this yoga, be it the capability of practising the mantra-yoga or attaining liberation.
api mantrādhikāritvaṃ muktiśca śivadīkṣayā | anenaitadapi proktaṃ yogī tattvaikyasiddhaye | | mantramevāśrayenmūlaṃ nirvikalpāntamādṛtaḥ | mantrābhyāsena bhogaṃ vā mokṣaṃ vāpi prasādhayan |	-a In his statement Śiva has also meant to lay stress on the point that for getting success in his effort to attain oneness with Siva, the aspirant is required to take Sri Tantrāloka resort to mantra, particularly in its root form respectfully, as it remains effective in his advancement up to the state of optionlessness. No matter, the aspirant's objective be attainment of the state of joy or liberation in order to attain it, he needs to be initiated by a suitable teacher.
tatrādhikāritālabdhyai dīkṣāṃ gṛhṇīta daiśikāt | tena mantrajñānayogabalādyadyatprasādhayet | |	By virtue of the initiation he would have access to mantra and knowledge both via which he would be able to seek help from the teacher in his other objectives also.
svabalenaiva bhogaṃ vā mokṣaṃ vā labhate budhaḥ | tena vijñānayogādibalī prāk samayī bhavan |	b-a The utility of initiation lies in the purification of the Self of the aspirant following which he having become wise, attains his objective by himself, be that joy or liberation.
putrako vā na tāvānsyādapitu svabalocitaḥ | yastu vijñānayogādivandhyaḥ so'ndho yathā pathi | daiśikāyatta eva syādbhoge muktau ca sarvathā | dīkṣā ca kevalā jñānaṃ vināpi nijamāntaram |	b-a By virtue of treading the path of the yoga of knowledge he now becomes capable of pursuing his objective without any care for his status as a follower of the principles or the sonship of his teacher. b-a Entirely different is the position of the candidate who is barren in comprehension as well as practice of yoga. He is like a blind man walking on the path.
mocikaiveti kathitaṃ yuktyā cāgamataḥ purā | yastu dīkṣākṛtāmevāpekṣya yojanikāṃ śiśuḥ |	b- a It has been stated in this text already that initiation in itself is sufficient to liberate the candidate and has been supported by the statement of the āgama śāstra.
| sphuṭībhūtyai taducitaṃ jñānaṃ yogamathāśritaḥ so'pi yatraiva yuktaḥ syāttanmayatvaṃ prapadyate |	How to reconcile both the position with each other? b-a Deliberation on Teacher's Acts During Initiation The child-like disciple moving on the path expecting of initiation itself as the way leading to liberation also may be successful in his attempt if he takes resort to yoga and knowledge diligently as directed by his teacher.
gurudīkṣāmantraśāstrādhīnasarvasthitistataḥ | duṣṭānāmeva sarveṣāṃ bhūtabhavyabhaviṣyatām | karmaṇāṃ śodhanaṃ kāryaṃ bukṣukṣorna śubhātmanām | yaḥ punarlaukikaṃ bhogaṃ rājyasvargādikaṃ śiśuḥ |	b- The entire path of transformation depends on four factors, namely, teacher, initiation, mantra and śāstra. a As regards initiation particularly of the aspirant of joy, only all the evil actions of him – past, present and future, need to be purified and by no means those which are of auspicious nature. Auspicious actions of him also, however, need to be purified who has got himself free of all desires concerning worldly pleasures, kingship, heavenly beatitude, etc.
tyaktvā lokottaraṃ bhogamīpsustasya śubheṣvapi |	and aspires only for the bliss of transcendence.
tatra dravyamayīṃ dīkṣāṃ kurvannājyatilādikaiḥ |	b-a As regards the initiation of the aspirant of worldly joys, his actions get purified besides other rites, through material oblations put in the fire consisting of ghrta, tila, etc.

As regards initiation into knowledge, the student gets purified only through firm resolve for unification with Siva besides the effect of the will-power of the teacher who has ascended the highest ladder of consciousness in his awareness. Following purification of his inauspicious actions his auspicious actions also get purified automatically owing to his taking to the path of inner equipoise.
śubhapākakramopāttaphalabhogasamāptitaḥ | yatraiṣa yojitastatstho bhāvikarmakṣaye kṛte | bhāvināṃ cādyadehasthadehāntaravibhedinām |	b-a Having enjoyed the results of auspicious actions until they get finished, the course of life he has been recommended by his teacher to follow, remaining firm on it he should act in such a way that he may not be required to suffer the consequences of those acts of the future and thus come to the end of the apprehension of any kind of sufferance itself.
aśubhāṃśaviśuddhau syādbhogasyaivānupakṣayaḥ | bhuñjānasyāsya satataṃ bhogānmāyālayāntataḥ | na duḥkhaphaladaṃ dehādyadhvamadhye'pi kiṃcana | tato māyālaye bhuktasamastasukhabhogakaḥ |	b-a Remaining enjoying the consequences of his noble actions until the end of the effect of māyā on him, there remains no fear to suffer in his life the bad effects of his actions on the entire path of assumption of body. b-a Coming to the end of māyā, since he until this state has already enjoyed exhaustively the consequences of his actions, he has the privilege of getting dissolved his being beyond the range of kalā or within it as per his aspiration by the force of unification.
niṣkale sakale vaiti layaṃ yojanikābalāt | iti prameyaṃ kathita dīkṣā kāle guroryathā |	b- e CHAPTER - Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth Now I propose to explain the procedure of imparting initiation having the promise of access to oneness with Bhairava.
atha bhairavatādātmyadāyinīṃ prakriyāṃ bruve | evaṃ maṇḍalakumbhāgniśiṣyasvātmasu pañcasu |	Under this procedure, the teacher needs to impress the student with the idea of his comprehension in all these five factors of initiation, namely, circle, jar, fire, student and he himself.
gṛhītvā vyāptimaikyena nyasyādhvānaṃ ca śiṣyagam | karmamāyāṇumalinatrayaṃ bāhau gale tathā |	In confirmation of this he has to tie three knots on the sacrificial thread as representative of the malice associated with the action karma, māyā and the individual anu to be ascribed to the student's hands, throat and crest respectively.
śikhāyāṃ ca kṣipetsūtragranthiyogena daiśikaḥ | tasyātadrūpatābhānaṃ malo granthiḥ sa kīrtyate | itipratītidāḍhryārthaṃ bahirgranthyupakalpanam | bāhū karmāspadaṃ viṣṇurmāyātmā galasaṃśritaḥ |	-a Śrī Tantrāloka Hands are the seat of action whose deity is Visnu while throat is the resort of māyā. On account of its downward movement from the top of the head as represented by the crest up to the mūlādhāra cakra, breath prāna represents the individual anu. This is the symbolism involved in this part of the ceremony.
adhovahā śikhāṇutvaṃ tenetthaṃ kalpanā kṛtā | naraśaktiśivākhyasya trayasya bahubhedatām |	b-a It is the combination of the three factors, namely, the individual, the Force and Siva which is responsible for the appearance of the entire spectrum of the Reality in all its multiplicity.
vaktuṃ tristriguṇaṃ sūtraṃ granthaye parikalpayet | tejojalānnatritayaṃ tredhā pratyekamapyadaḥ |	It is for the sake of bearing out this fundamental triplicity of the Reality, the symbolic thread is required to be made threefold and tied as indicated herewith.
śrutyante ke'pyataḥ śuklakṛṣṇaraktaṃ prapedire | tato'gnau tarpitāśeṣamantre cidvyomamātrake |	b-a Some scholars are of the view that, as per the account of the Veda, since the universe is formed basically of three factors, namely, fire, water and earth each of which is of three kinds, i.e., sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa represented respectively by the colours red, white and black; the sacrificial thread yajñopavita is made twice threefold as explained in the Upanisad.
sāmānyarūpe tattvānāṃ kramācchuddhiṃ samācaret | tatra svamantrayogena dharāmāvāhayetpurā |	b-a Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth In the process of purification, first of all needs to be invoked by means of mantras relevant to it is the Earth.
iṣṭvā puṣpādibhiḥ sarpistilādyairatha tarpayet | tattattvavyāpikāṃ paścānmāyātattvādhidevatām |	Then it should be satiated with the offering of flowers, etc. and oblation of purified butter, tila and objects of the kind.
māyāśakti svamantreṇāvāhyābhyarcya pratarpayet | āvāhane mātṛkārṇaṃ mālinyarṇaṃ ca pūjane | kuryāditi gurū prāha svarūpāpyāyanadvayāt | tāro varṇo'tha saṃbuddhipadaṃ tvamityataḥ param |	After purifying the earth, the teacher should undertake purification of the Māyā which comprehends the earth also. For its purification its presiding deity needs to be invoked by means of mantras addressed to it followed by its worship and satiation. b-a As per the advise of my teacher in the task of invocation, letters of the mātrkā need to be used while in that of worship those of the mālini on account of the former giving the shape to the world and the latter's pervasion of it.
uttamaikayutaṃ karmapadaṃ dīpakamapyataḥ | tubhyaṃ nāma caturthyantaṃ tato'pyucitadīpakam | ityūhamantrayogena tattatkarma pravartayet | āvāhanānantaraṃ hi karma sarvaṃ nigadyate |	b-a This invocation should be designed as follows: It should start with recitation of Om followed by the word meaning earth in the vocative case dhare, pronoun you tubhyam, verb in the first person āvāhayāmi and the adverb of obeisance namah. After the invocation, the follow-up it is being made out.
āvāhanaṃ ca saṃbodhaḥ svasvabhāvavyavasthiteḥ | bhāvasyāhaṃmayasvātmatādātmyāveśyamānatā |	b- NOTES: The invocation mantra is : Om dhare tubhyam āvāhayāmi namah Invocation amounts to getting established within one's own inherent nature by taking resort to one's Self and being absorbed in it.
śāktī bhūmiśca saivoktā yasyāṃ mukhyāsti pūjyatā | abhātatvādabhedācca nahyasau nṛśivātmanoḥ |	It is only against the background of pre-eminence accorded to Sakti that there is the possibility of the actuality of worship at which state the Reality remains hidden and by no means share oneness in the common Self due to elimination of the difference between the two.
namaskārāntatāyogātpūrṇaṃ sattāṃ prakalpayet | tataḥ pūrṇasvabhāvatvaṃ tadrūpodrekayogataḥ |	-a It is only on admittance of consciousness as the most fundamental reality in the entire spectrum of the creation that the worshipper comes to get restored his inherent completeness followed by the same of the object of meditation.
dhyeyodreko bhaveddhyātṛprahvībhāvavaśādyataḥ | āvāhyeṣṭvā pratayeti śrīsvacchande nirūpitam | anenaiva pathāneyamityasmadguravo juguḥ | paratvena tu yatpūjyaṃ tatsvatantracidātmakam |	b- a Our teachers have told us with reference to the Svacchanda Sāstra the process of withdrawal as consisting of invocation, offering of oblation and satiation. b- a Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth It is only under the supposition of its complete otherness from the worshipper that what is pure consciousness and delight may have the possibility of being worshipped.
prakāśanāyāṃ vai na syātprakāśasya prakāśatā |	Being in itself the totality of Light, it is impossible to be subjected to illumination from anywhere.
tatkarmābhyūhanaṃ kuryātpratyuta vyavadhātṛtām | bahistathātmatābhāve kāryaṃ karmapadohanam |	b-a It is its own worthiness of being worshipped, meditated on and accomplishing the impossible which is the manifestation of its autonomy. b-a What is consciousness itself can by no means be made the object of consciousness.
aṃśaiḥ sādhyaṃ na tatroho dīkṣaṇādividhiṣviva | tataḥ śiṣyasya tattattvasthāne'streṇa pratāḍanam | kṛtvātha śivahastena hṛdayaṃ parimarśayet | tataḥ svanāḍīmārgeṇa hṛdayaṃ prāpya vai śiśoḥ |	Similarly, what is luminous in itself can by no means be made the object of illumination. b-a Against the background of the statement of impossibility of illumining the self- luminous the author's response is that use of the vocative case in the invocation of deity without any reference to Its capability of playing the role desired by the invoker needs to be taken as implying cognisance of Its autonomy.
śiṣyātmanā sahraikatvaṃ gatvādāya ca taṃ hṛdā | puṭitaṃ haṃsarūpākhyaṃ tatra saṃhāramudrayā |	In the case of paying obeisance to the deity use of the word namah, svāhā, etc. is confirmatory of the same point.
kuryādātmīyahṛdayasthitamapyavabhāsakam | śiṣyadehasya tejobhī raśmimātrāviyogataḥ | svabandhasthānacalanāt svatantrasthānalābhataḥ | svakarmāparatantratvātsarvatrotpattimarhati |	b-a Sri Tantrāloka While the word namah implies perfection in the act of surrender, svāhā on account of combining in it svā and hā implying moon and fire respectively amounts to recognising the formation of the world as a result of interaction between the elements of immortality and mortality pervading the whole of it as well as responsible for all actions and reactions in it.
tatrāsya garbhādhānaṃ ca yuktaṃ puṃsavanādibhiḥ | garbhaniṣkrāmaparyantairekāṃ kurvīta saṃskriyām |	b-a As regards the position of deliberation in course of initiation, it needs to be used in the determination of the object of worship, etc. particularly in such contexts where the same would have remained obscure.
garbhādhānaṃ karomīti punarmantraṃ tameva ca | guruḥ | |	In such cases the teacher is required to make it explicit through use of his deliberation.
bhoge layaṃ karomīti punarmantraṃ tameva ca | svāhāntamāhutīstisro dadyādājyatilādibhiḥ |	b-a Wherever the object of any ceremonial performance may not be explicit, the teacher should use his discretion to make it explicit.
eṣa eva vamanyādau vidhiḥ pañcadaśāntake | pūrvaṃ parātmakaṃ mantramamukātmana ityatha |	In such cases, however, where the object be stated clearly via the mantra itself, deliberation is not called for at all. b-a Particularly in the determination of the locus of external actions, such as sprinkling of water, etc.
pāśacchedaṃ karomīti parāmantraḥ punastataḥ | huṃ svāhā phaṭ samuccārya dadyāttisro'pyathāhutīḥ |	deliberation is a must, in the lack of which there is the apprehension of the act being misdirected. b-a Deliberation is necessary in such cases as propitiation, offering of oblation, unfettering, etc.
saṃskārāṇāṃ catuṣke'sminye mantrāḥ kathitā mayā | teṣu karmapadātpūrvaṃ dharātattvapadaṃ vadet |	where the effect of the action is visibly discernible. b-a Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth Insuch cases, however, where the consequence may depend on severalsubsequent actions, such as offering initiation, etc.
tato dharātattvapatimāmantryeṣṭvā pratarpya ca | śivābhimānasaṃrabdho gururevaṃ samādiśet | |	b-a Then the teacher should use the relevant mantras to strike at sensitive points of the student’s body by means of closure of his fist beginning from the smallest finger and ending with tightening of it by means of the thumb.
tattveśvara tvayā nāsya putrakasya śivājñayā | pratibandhaḥ prakartavyo yātuḥ padamanāmayam | tato yadi samīheta dharātattvāntarālagam | pṛthak śodhayituṃ mantrī bhuvanādyadhvapañcakam |	Thus the teacher needs to recreate the body of the student by bringing it close to his heart, reshaping it in accordance with its performed prototype and actualise the same in its novel form up to the physical within the range of māyā up to the earth. In this way, the teacher is required to undergo all the stages of the act of prenatal samskāras such as impregnation, purnsvana, etc. up to exit from the womb.
aparāmantrataḥ prāgvattisrastistrastadāhutīḥ | dadyātpuraṃ śodhayāmītyūhayuktaṃ prasannadhīḥ |	Then, he should offer three times oblation consisting of clarified butter and tila to fire with the utterance of the word svāhā. b- Following elimination of these three kinds of impressions comes the number of doing the same with the fourth one.
evaṃ kalāmantrapadavarṇeṣvapi vicakṣaṇaḥ | titrastisro hutīrdadyāt pṛthak sāmastyato'pi vā |	In this case, utterance of the mantras vama and piba, etc. needs to be preceded by the same of the higher order in the name of the student.
tataḥ pūrṇāhutiṃ dattvā parayā vauṣaḍantayā | aparāmantrataḥ śiṣyamuddhṛtyātmahadaṃ nayet | |	Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth Then, he should make the final offering of oblation to fire through the mantra of the higher order ending with the adverb vausat. This is to be followed by utterance of the mantra of the lower order, raising the student and bringing him close to his heart.
yadā tvekena śuddhena tadantarbhāvacintanāt | na pṛthak śodhayettattvanāthasaṃśravaṇātparam |	In case of anyone of these paths having been purified followed by contemplation in regard to it, there is no necessity of purification of any other one of these paths after having listened to the voice of the Lord of these essences.
tadā pūrṇāṃ vitoryāṇumutkṣipyātmani yojayet | tātsthyātmasaṃsthyayogāya tayaivāparayāhutīḥ | sakarmapadayā dadyāditi kecittu manvate | anye tu guravaḥ prāhurbhāvanāmayamīdṛśam |	This is to be followed by the offering of the final oblation to the fire, raising of the student, bringing him close to his heart by the teacher, with the utterance of the mantra of the higher order and offering of the oblation in the name of the student according to some of the authorities while the rest hold that this part of the ceremony may get fulfilled simply by ideation like that needing no separate utterance concerning it.
evaṃ prāktanatātsthyātmasaṃsthatve yojayedguruḥ | tataḥ śiṣyahṛdaṃ neyaḥ sa ātmā tāvato'dhvanaḥ | |	In their view, the teacher needs to leave the student remain established in the state of being he has already arrived at depending on his choice whether to make the offering or not. After this the teacher should bring the student close to his heart with the idea that he has been associated with all these paths.
śuddhastaddārḍhyasiddhyai ca pūrṇā syātparayā punaḥ | mahāpāśupataṃ pūrvaṃ vilomasya viśuddhaye |	- Purification of the path amounts to student's getting firmly established on the path concerned. This process of purification and firmness on the path needs to be sealed by the utterance of the mantra of the higher order.
juhomi punarastreṇa vauṣaḍanta iti kṣipet | punaḥ pūrṇāṃ tato māyāmabhyarcyātha visarjayet | dharātattvaṃ viśuddhaṃ sajjalena śuddharūpiṇā | bhāvayenmiśritaṃ vāri śuddhiyogyaṃ tato bhavet | |	This is to be followed by the utterance of the verb juhomi I offer oblation and chanting of astra mantra phat ending with the adverb vausat may carry away followed by putting the oblation to the fire. Then he should worship māyā, make the final offering and disperse her off. The element of earth should be purified by mixing it with purified water and thus consider it to have become doubly purified.
tathā tattatpurātattvamiśraṇāduttarottaram | sarvā śivībhavettattvāvalī śuddhānyathā pṛthak |	- Twofold purification of elements means making them pure in themselves followed by mixing of pure ones with one another. This process of purification and re-purification of elements culminates in their transformation into Siva hood.
pṛthaktvaṃ ca malo māyābhidhānastasya saṃbhave | karmakṣaye'pi no muktirbhavedvidyeśvarādivat | |	Standing with the range of māyā does not permit liberation even in spite of getting redeemed of the impressions of action as is evident from the fate of ruling deities of vidyā, etc.
tato'pi jalatattvasya vahnau vyomni cidātmake | āhvānādyakhilaṃ yāvattejasyasya vimiśraṇam |	Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth After purification of the earth, water should be purified through its intermixture with fire culminating ultimately in its merger into the Space of Consciousness.
evaṃ kramātkalātattve śuddhe pāśaṃ bhujāśritam | chindyātkalā hi sā kiṃcitkartṛtvonmīlanātmikā |	In this way, on the purging of kalā as a cover, the fetter associated with the hand needs to be broken so that the kalā of purity may remove the limitations of action put on it.
karmākhyamalajṛmbhātmā taṃ ca granthiṃ srugagragam | pūrṇāhutyā samaṃ vahnimantratejasi nirdahet | | mantro hi viśvarūpaḥ sannupāśrayavaśāttathā | vyaktarūpastato vahnau pāśaploṣavidhāyakaḥ |	Hand is the resort of the malice of limitation on action. This limitation need to be burnt through pouring of clarified butter into the fire of mantra dropped from the fore-part of the ladle. This is so because of the universal comprehension of the mantra by taking resort to which its force manifesting itself as fire becomes effective in burning the fetter.
pluṣṭo līnasvabhāvo'sau pāśastaṃ prati śambhuvat | parameśamahātejaśeṣamātratvamaśnute |	Having got burnt the fetter disappears in the same way as the demon of cupidity having been burnt in the fire of Siva's anger was turned into ashes.
karmapāśe'tra hotavye pūrṇasyāsya śubhāśubham | aśubhaṃ vā bhavadbhūtaṃ bhāvi vātha samastakam |	On the fetter of action having been put to the fire born of the mantra, the teacher should express his resolve for burning the entire stock of action, auspicious and inauspicious both as also past, present and future with the utterance of the mantra of this import three times adding phat svāhā to it.
dahāmi phaṭtrayaṃ vauṣaḍiti pūrṇāṃ vinikṣipet | evaṃ māyāntasaṃśuddhau kaṇṭhapāśaṃ ca homayet | pūrṇasya tasya māyākhyaṃ pāśabhedaprathātmakam | dahāmi phaṭtrayaṃ vauṣaḍiti pūrṇāṃ kṣipedguruḥ | rnirbījā yadi kāryā tu tadātraivāparāṃ kṣipet | pūrṇāṃ samayapāśakhyabījadāhapadānvitām |	After purging all up to māyā, he needs to offer to that fire the fetter of the throat also. - Further, the teacher needs to put to fire the final oblation to get burnt the fetter known as related to māyā, which is of the nature of division, with the utterance of the following mantra thrice to the effect, I am burning phat vausat If the initiation be required to be made effective in rendering the impressions of the student in respect of the observance of the rules of the discipline as a fetter also seedless, an additional offering of the oblation should be made.
gurau deve tathā śāstre bhaktiḥ kāryāsya nahyasau | samayaḥ śaktipātasya svabhāvo hyeṣa no pṛthak |	Devotion to teacher, God and śāstra being not a part of the rules of conduct of the discipline but a precondition of the descent of grace, it needs to be excluded from the list of the conduct of the discipline.
māyānte śuddhimāyāte vāgīśī yā purābhavat | māyā śaktimayī saiva vidyāśaktitvamaśnute | tacchuddhavidyāmāhūya vidyāśaktiṃ niyojayet | evaṃ krameṇa saṃśuddhe sadāśivapade'pyalam | |	At the end of the māyā through the prayer of it, the vāgiśi, as referred to already becomes effective as the force of vidyā wisdom. Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth Following purger of māyā, pure wisdom śuddha vidyā needs to be invoked and directed to action on the student. Being thus purged of all the dross on his personality, he becomes worthy of getting promoted to the state of Sadāśiva.
śikhāṃ granthiyutāṃ chittvā malamāṇavakaṃ dahet | yato'dhikārabhogākhyau dvau pāśau tu sadāśive | |	At this stage, he may get clean-shaved of the knot of his crest and redeemed of the state of being considered as a youngster. -a Two fetters remain intact in Sadāśiva.
ityuktyāṇavapāśo'tra māyīyastu niśāvadhiḥ | śiṣyo yathocitaṃ snāyādācāmeśikaḥ svayam |	These are authority and enjoyment. These are of the nature of māyā and stay up to the end of the ignorance.
āṇavākhye vinirdagdhe hyadhovāhiśikhāmale | tataḥ prāguktasakalaprameyaṃ paricintayan |	The student should take his proper bath after it and the teacher needs to sip water on account of burning down of the deepest malice.
śiṣyadehādimātmīyadehaprāṇādiyojitam | kṛtvātmadehaprāṇāderviśvamantaranusmaret uktaprakriyayā caivaṃ dṛḍhabuddhirananyadhīḥ | |	b-a Following the removal of this malice, the student needs to contemplate on the entire subject explained earlier how the teacher associated the body and life-force of the student with his own body and life-force, etc.
prāṇasthaṃ deśakālādhvayugaṃ prāṇaṃ ca śaktigam |	Getting fully confirmed in that association, he should resolve to remain steadfast on those points in regard to space, time and life-force.
tāṃ ca saṃvidgatāṃ śuddhāṃ saṃvidaṃ śivarūpiṇīm | śiṣyasaṃvidabhinnāṃ ca mantravādyabhedinīm | dhyāyan prāgvatprayogeṇa śivaṃ sakalaniṣkalam | ṭryātmaka vā kṣipetpūrṇāṃ praśāntakaraṇena tu |	b- Contemplating on his purified consciousness becoming one with that of the teacher's on the one hand with the same of Śiva's on the other and thus becoming universalised by virtue of breaking all the intervening barriers by the force of the mantra and the fire, the student needs to think of Siva in both His phases, namely the transcendent and the immanent and how that all-inclusive comprehension was bringing peace to his mind as does the final oblation to the sacrificial fire.
uktaṃ traiśirase tantre sarvasaṃpūraṇātmakam | mūlādudayagatyā tu śivenduparisaṃplutam |	- It has been pointed out in the Traisiras Tantra how to satiate the Self with the ambrosia of wisdom or consciousness which brings fulfilment to the entire personality of the aspirant.
janmāntamadhyakuharamūlasrotaḥ samutthitam | śivārkaraśmibhistībraiḥ kṣubdhaṃ jñānāmṛtaṃ tu yat | tena saṃtarpayetsamyak praśāntakaraṇena tu | śūnyadhāmābjamadhyasthaprabhākiraṇabhāsvaraḥ | |	The movement of the prāņa upward starts from the root of mūlādhāra cakra and arrives finally at the moon of Śiva where lies the point of fulfilment. The root of life lies in the cavity between the mūlādhāra cakra and the svādhisthāna while the spring of ambrosia lies on the point of meeting of the rays of the moon and the sun. It is owing to meeting of their rays and agitation caused by that meeting that ambrosia of consciousness oozes out.
ādheyādhāraniḥspandabodhaśāstraparigrahaḥ | janmādheyaprapañcaikasphoṭasaṃghaṭaṭghaṭaṭnaḥ | mūlasthānātsamārabhya kṛtvā someśamantagam | khamivātiṣṭhate yāvatpraśāntaṃ tāvaducyate | |	-a The aspirant becomes perfectly at peace when he gets established on the point of rather spacelessness having started from the point of origin and reaches the meeting point of the moon and the sun where spark the ray of light from the contact of the germ and its recipient and consequently blooms the lotus of the supernal consciousness results in the state of elimination of the function of manas unmanībhāva.
uktaṃ śrīpūrvaśāstre ca srucamāpūrya sarpiṣā | kṛtvā śiṣyaṃ yathātmasthaṃ mūlamantramanusmaran | | śivaṃ śakti tathātmānaṃ śiṣyaṃ sarpistathānalam | ekīkurvañchanairgaccheddvādaśāntamananyadhīḥ | | tatra kumbhakamāsthāya dhyāyansakalaniṣkalam | tiṣṭhettāvadanudvigno yāvadājyakṣayo bhavet | evaṃ yuktaḥ pare tattve guruṇā śivamūrtinā | na bhūyaḥ paśutāmeti dagdhamāyānibandhanaḥ |	b- Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth It has been observed in the prior śāstra in the idioms of sacrifice that having filled the ladle with the clarified butter, the teacher needs to make the student contained within himself contemplating on the sense of the fundamental mantra, thinking of Śiva, Sakti, himself, the student, the ghrta and the fire as one and the same, should move to the end of the twelve ultimate ingredients of his being in the state of exclusive meditation and having stopped the process of breathing contemplating on the transcendent and immanent together with rapt attention without any agitation in his inner being should remain so until the last drop of the butter gets consumed by the fire. - Having been united with the Ultimate Reality by the teacher in the capacity of Siva, the student gets burnt the entire trap of māyā keeping him bound in the state of animality and becomes rid of the danger of getting entrapped by it for ever.
tadā tattattvabhūmau tu tatsaṃkhyāyāmananyadhīḥ | punaryojanikāṃ kuryātpūrṇāhutyantareṇa tu | muktipradā bhogamokṣapradā vā yā prakīrtitā | dīkṣā sā syātsabījatvanirbījātmatayā dvidhā |	After the fall of the body, if the disciple were to aspire for experiencing the joy of being integrally or severally culminating in the attainment of the Highest, the teacher needs to make provision for it through the offering of another complete oblation. Thus, initiation gets characterised into two kinds, that is, seeded and seedless.
bāle nirjñātamaraṇe tvaśakte vā jarādibhiḥ | kāryā nirbījikā dīkṣā śaktipātabalodaye |	Seedless initiation should be done of those who die young, whose death is unknown, who die in the state of incapability of undergoing the process of initiation or due to incapacitating old age, etc.
nirbījāyāṃ sāmayāṃstu pāśānapi viśodhayet | kṛtanirbījadīkṣastu devāgnigurubhaktibhāk |	In the event of offer of this kind of initiation, it becomes necessary on the part of the teacher to purify the codes of conduct of the School along with removal of the traps. The recipient of the seedless initiation needs to remain devoted to the God, fire and the teacher.
itayaiva śivaṃ yāyāt sadyo bhogān vibhujya vā | śrīmaddīkṣottare coktaṃ cāre ṣaṭtriṃśadaṅgule |	By virtue of such devotion he becomes sure to get oneness with Śiva immediately or after enjoying the felicities of life.
tattvānyāpādamūrdhāntaṃ bhuvanāni tyajetkramāt | tuṭimātraṃ niṣkalaṃ tadadehaṃ tadahaṃparam |	Thus the body becomes just a moment, rid of kalā, and a state of sheer bodilessness associated only with the sense of I-ness. In such a case, the teacher needs to resolve meditatively that he is offering him as an oblation to the fire of consciousness.
śaktyā tatra kṣipāmyenamiti dhyāyaṃstu dīkṣayet | sabījāyāṃ tu dīkṣāyāṃ samayānna viśodhayet |	This should be followed by his initiation. b-a Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth In case of seeded initiation there is no necessity of purification of the codes of conduct of the School.
viśeṣastvayametasyāṃ yāvajjīvaṃ śiśorguruḥ | śeṣavṛttyai śuddhatattvasṛṣṭi kurvīta pūrṇayā | | abhinnācchivasaṃbodhajaladheryugapatsphurat | pūrṇāṃ kṣipaṃstattvajālaṃ dhyāyedbhārūpakaṃ sṛtam |	Instead of it, here the teacher is required to create pure essence for him for the remaining part of the student's conduct which should be accomplished via submission of the entire net of essences all at once to the ocean of Śiva's consciousness which is Siva Himself and meditate on it in its infinite expanse of illumination.
viśuddhatattvasṛṣṭiṃ vā kuryātkumbhābhiṣecanāt | tathā dhyānabalādeva yadvā pūrṇābhiṣecanaiḥ | |	b- Or, alternatively, he should create purified essence for the student by means of bathing him with the water of the jar with the use of the force of meditation.
pṛthivī sthirarūpāsya śivarūpeṇa bhāvitā | sthirīkaroti tāmeva bhāvanāmiti śuddhayati | |	The object of the meditation of the teacher would be the stability of Śiva- consciousness in him as the earth's conceived as Siva Himself on account of remaining constant despite all changes going on its surface notwithstanding.
jalamāpyāyayatyenāṃ tejo bhāsvaratāṃ nayet | marudānandasaṃsparśaṃ vyoma vaitatyamāvahet |	By virtue of the teacher's meditation the water of the bath would remain pervasively with him keeping him ever purified, illumination as the object of meditation would keep him illumined, air would bring to him the delight of touch while space would remain with him in his expansion of consciousness.
evaṃ tanmātravargo'pi śivatāmaya iṣyate | parānandamahāvyāptiraśeṣamalavicyutiḥ | |	In the same way the essences of these elements tanmātrās would bring Siva- hood to him supernal delight, complete pervasiveness and freedom from malice.
śive gantṛtvamādānamupādeyaśivastutiḥ | śivāmodabharāsvādadarśanasparśanānyalam tadākarṇanamityevamindriyāṇāṃ viśuddhatā | saṃkalpādhyavasāmānā prakāśo raktisaṃsthinī | śivātmatvena yatseyaṃ śuddhatā mānasādike | niyamo rañjanaṃ kartṛbhāva kalanayā saha | vedanaṃ heyavastvaṃśaviṣaye suptakalpatā | itthaṃ śivaikyarūḍhasya ṣaṭkañcukagaṇo'pyayam |	By virtue of prevalence of Śiva-hood in him, he would, now move in Śiva-hood, give and take in Śiva-hood, pray in Śiva-hood, smell in Śiva-hood, hear in Siva hood, making himself thus getting fully purified on the ground of the senses followed by that of mentation, resolution, illumination, attraction, ego-sense and complete situation. - Owing to ascendancy of Śiva-hood on him on all strata of his being, the covering kancūka of niyati would get transformed in him into principles of being, attachment rāga would get transformed into devotion to the Supernal Essence, ego-sense ahankāra into creativity of the higher order, divisiveness kalā into artistic creation, flux of time kāla into eternity, intelligence vidyā into the wisdom of all-comprehending understanding due to elimination of the restraint on it of acceptance and rejection.
śuddha eva pumāna prāptaśivabhāvo viśuddhyati | vidyeśādiṣu tattveṣu naiva kācidaśuddhatā | ityevaṃ śuddhatattvānāṃ sṛṣṭyā śiṣyo'pi tanmayaḥ | bhaveddhyetatsūcitaṃ śrīmālinīvijayottare |	- Thus, the individual having already been purified, as a result of which he could attain oneness with Siva, having become so, gets further purged in his being Rite of Initiation Beginning from Birth on account of that oneness. As regards the position of Vidyā, Īśvara, Sadāśiva, etc., there is nothing impure in them at all. In this way, the disciple by virtue of getting purged on all strata of his being becomes absolutely one with purity itself.
bandhamokṣāvubhāvetāvindriyāṇi jagurbudhāḥ | nigṛhītāni bandhāya vimuktāni vimuktaye |	- Wise men have said that bondage and liberation both are dependent on the status of the senses. Bondage lies in their being bound while liberation in their being liberated.
etāni vyāpake bhāve yadā syurmanasā saha | muktāni kvāpi viṣaye rodhādbandhāya tāni tu |	When they remain associated with mind in its pervasive sense, they become redeemed bringing liberation to the individual concerned. When, on the contrary, they get bound to certain objects, they result in the bondage of him.
ityevaṃ dvividho bhāvaḥ śuddhāśuddhaprabhedataḥ | indriyāṇāṃ samākhyātaḥ siddhayogīśvare mate |	Thus has been explained the twofold role of the senses, that is, the pure and the impure as per the Siddhayogiśvari Tantra.
śrīmān vidyāgurustvāha pramāṇastutidarśane | samastamantrairdīkṣāyāṃ niyamastveṣa kathyate |	My teacher of learning also has stated the same in his work titled Pramāna-stuti- darśana. This is also the import of all the mantras used in course of the rite of initiation.
māyāntaśuddhau sarvāḥ syuḥ kriyā hyaparayā sadā | dvyātmayā sakalānte tu niṣkale parayaiva tu |	Sri Tantrāloka In the purification of all the elements up to māyā, all the mantras of lower order need to be used while in the purification up to sakala those of lower and higher order and in the purification up to mandala only those of the higher nature are to be used.
tu īśānte ca pibanyādi sakalānte'ṅgapañcakam | ityevaṃvidhimālocya karma kuryādgurūttamaḥ |	Up to the end of the Isa, piba, etc. should be used and up to sakala all the five kinds. Keeping this rule in mind the teacher should conduct the entire affair of the rite.
purādhvani hutīnāṃ yā sakhyeyaṃ tattvavarṇayoḥ | tāmeva dviguṇīkuryātpadādhvani caturguṇām | kramānmantrakalāmārge dviguṇā dviguṇā kramāt | yāvattritattvasaṃśuddhau syādviśatiguṇā tataḥ | |	- As regards the section of the rite concerning the path of the state of being bhuvanādhvā, the number of oblations should be the same as is used in the case of elements and letters, the double of it should be offered in the case of words, four times of it in the case of mantrādhvā, the double of it on the path of kalā while twenty times of it in the case of purification of three elements together.
pratikarma bhavetṣaṣṭirāhutīnāṃ tritattvake | ekatattve śataṃ prāhurāhutīnāṃ tu sāṣṭakam | |	- In the case of making offering to three elements together, the number of oblations offered should be sixty while in the case of only one element, it needs to be made one hundred and eight times.
vilomakarmaṇā sākaṃ yāḥ pūrṇāhutayaḥ smṛtāḥ | tāsāṃ sarvādhvasaṃśuddhau saṃkhyānyatvaṃ na kiñcana |	In the rite reversed to it, there is no change in the number of full offerings recommended to be made on it meant for purification of all the paths together.
ityeṣā kathitā dīkṣā jananādisamanvitā | |	Thus has been recounted here the entire procedure of the rite of initiation beginning from birth.
na rajo nādhivāso'tra bhūkṣetraparigrahaḥ | yatra tatra pradeśe tu pūjayitvā guruḥ śivam | adhvānaṃ manasā dhyātvā dīkṣayettattvapāragaḥ | jananādivihīnāṃ tu yena yenādhvanā guruḥ |	CHAPTER C Abridged form of Initiation Prescribed by Lord Śiva Now is being presented an abridged form of the rite of initiation meant for attaining Siva-hood. In this form of initiation, there is no place for application of ash, dwelling in the proximity of the teacher nor even association with any particular ground or area. At any place, the competent teacher may worship Siva, meditate on the path along which he would chose his disciple to lead and offer the initiation without any reference to birth, etc.
kuryātsa ekatattvāntāṃ śivabhāvaikabhāvitaḥ | parāmantrastato'syeti tattvaṃ saṃśodhayāmyatha | svaheti pratitattvaṃ syācchuddhe pūrṇāhutiṃ kṣipet | evaṃ mantrāntaraiḥ kuryātsamastairathavoktavat |	Contemplating exclusively on Siva alone, he should initiate the disciple to move on the same path with the use of the supernal mantra. “I am purifying together all the constituents of his being herewith.” - With this resolve in mind he needs to offer oblations to fire with the mention of the constituent element concerned and utterance of the word svāhā along with each act of the offer as the final one. So he should do along with utterance of other relevant mantras or with all of them as prescribed.
parāsaṃpuṭitaṃ nāma svāhāntaṃ prathamāntakam | śataṃ sahastraṃ sāṣṭaṃ vā tena śaktyaiva homayet |	With the addition of the mantra of the Supernal Wisdom to the relevant one ending with the adverb svāhā, he needs to offer one hundred and eight or one thousand and eight oblations to the fire as per his capacity.
tataḥ pūrṇeti saṃśodhyahīnamuttamamīdṛśam | dīkṣākarmoditaṃ tatra tatra śāstre maheśinā |	Thus should be accomplished the act of initiation without going into the details of the act of purification of anything and hence taking everything as inherently pure in itself. This has been stated by Lord Siva Himself in śāstras here and there.
pratyekaṃ mātṛkāyugmavarṇaistattvāni śodhayet| yadi vā piṇḍamantreṇa sarvamantreṣvayaṃ vidhiḥ |	As regards the act of purification, it needs to be performed with the application of either the seed-mantra or the verbalised form of it with the use of both mātrkā and mālini groups of letters. This method is applicable to all kinds of mantras.
yathā yathā ca svabhyastajñānastanmayatātmakaḥ| gurustathā tathā kuryāt saṃkṣiptaṃ karma nānyathā |	The teacher needs to perform the act of initiation in keeping with his practical experience in this regard with his complete personal involvement in it briefly and by no means in any other way.
śrībrahmayāmale coktaṃ saṃkṣipte'pi hi bhāvayet | vyāptiṃ sarvādhvasāmānyāṃ kiṃtu yāge na vistaraḥ | atanmayībhūtamiti vikṣiptaṃ karma sandadhat | kramāttādātmyametīti vikṣiptaṃ vidhimācaret |	Abridged form of Initiation Prescribed by Lord Śiva It has been observed in the Brahmayāmala Tantra that the teacher should briefly conceive of his act as all-comprehending and inclusive of all the paths, despite shortness on the sacrificial ground. The detailed rite of initiation leads to distraction in the concentration as well as devotion of the disciple no doubt but at the same time it is also helpful in the intensification of his interest in it ultimately.
saṃkṣipto vidhirukto'yaṃ kṛpayā yaḥ śivoditaḥ | dīkṣottare kairaṇe ca tatra tatrāpi śāsane |	This abridged form of initiation, however, has been prescribed by Lord Śiva Himself here and there in Sāstras like Diksottara and Kirana out of His kindness.
atha sadyaḥ samutkrāntipradā dīkṣā nirūpyate | tatkṣaṇāccopabhogādvā dehapāte śivaṃ vrajeta | ityuktyā mālinīśāstre sūcitāsau maheśinā | dehāpāte samīpasthe śaktipātasphuṭatvataḥ | āsādya śāṃkarīṃ dīkṣāṃ tasmāddīkṣākṣaṇātparam |	This form of initiation, as indicated by Lord Siva and recounted by the Mālinivijayottara Tantra, is that on account of which the initiated person has the possibility of reaching Siva immediately or after having exhausted the impressions of his actions through enjoyment. When the disciple be close to leaving the body following expressly the shedding of grace on him, if he has the advantage of initiation in Saivism, he has the possibility of reaching Siva.
śivaṃ vrajedityartho'tra pūrvāparavivecanāt | vyākhyātaḥ śrīmatāsmākaṃ guruṇā śambhumūrtinā |	Our teacher Sambhu, like Siva himself in the human form, has explained to us this thing along with the preceding causes and following results of it.
yadā hyāsannamaraṇe śaktipātaḥ prajāyate | tatra mande'tha gurvādisevayāyuḥ kṣayaṃ vrajet |	- Sri Tantrāloka If he be furnished with the grace on him by the time of his closeness to death, then despite the deficiency of service to the teacher, etc. he is likely to leave the body.
athavā bandhumitrādidvārā sāsya vibhoḥ patet | pūrvaṃ vā samayī naiva parāṃ dīkṣāmavāptavān |	Alternatively, if the grace of the Lord be caused to fall on him by his associates, friends, etc., he may attain Śiva-hood by virtue of the inclination of the higher kind, without even having elapsed any time in observing the codes of conduct of the School.
āptadīkṣo'pi vā prāṇāñjihāsuḥ kleśavarjitam | antyāngurustadā kuryātsadyatkrāntidīkṣaṇam |	- Even after having been initiated, if the person concerned may like to leave the body without much trouble to him, his teacher may arrange for his initiation in the rite of leaving the body immediately utkrānti.
natvapakvamale nāpi śeṣakārmikavigrahe | kuryādutkramaṇaṃ śrīmadgahvare ca nirūpitam |	It has been pointed out in the Gahvara śāstra that this initiation of immediate redemption from body should not be conferred on one whose malice has remained immature and sticking to his body.
dṛṣṭvā śiṣyaṃ jarāgrastaṃ vyādhinā paripīḍitam | utkramayya tatastvenaṃ paratattve niyojayet |	However, if the disciple be seen as getting consumed by old age and suffering from various kinds of diseases, it becomes necessary for the teacher to accord to him the redemptive initiation so that he may get associated with the Supreme Being.
viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyatve kāmacāravidhānataḥ | pūrvoktamarthajātaṃ śrīśambhunātra nirūpitam |	Initiation for Immediate Liberation In regard to this kind of initiation our teacher Sambhunātha has observed that in according this kind of initiation care should be taken of the facts that the disciple's actions might have got ripened and he should have been initiated already.
vidhiṃ pūrvoditaṃ sarvaṃ kṛtvā samayaśuddhitaḥ | kṣurikāmasya vinyasyejjvalantīṃ marmakartarīm | kṛtvā pūrvoditaṃ nyāsaṃ kālānalasamaprabham | saṃhṛtikramataḥ sārdhaṃ sṛkchindiyugalena tu | āgneyīṃ dhāraṇāṃ kṛtvā sarvamarmapratāpanīm | pūrayedvāyunā dehamaṅguṣṭhānmastakāntakam |	Having performed all the rites as indicated already, the teacher should purify the time followed by assignment of the mantra considered as performative of the function of a knife, burning and apt to cut the sensitive points of the body of the dying person. Having performed the rite of assignment, referred to already, which is like the fire of the time of dissolution, the teacher should make application of knife-like double-edged mantra from the toe to the top of the head, and assuming the posture dhāranā as fire torturous of all the sensitive points of the body and should fill the entire body from toe to head with air through kumbhaka.
tamutkṛṣya tato'ṅaguṣṭhādūrdhvāntaṃ vakṣyamāṇayā | kṛntenmarmāṇi randhrāntāt kālarātryā visarjayet |	This operation should be done on the whole body from toe to top of the head followed by handing over the body to the night of death. This operation is conducted without any offering of oblation.
anena kramayogena yojito hutivarjitaḥ | samayyapyeti tāṃ dīkṣāmiti śrīmālinīmate |	It is applicable to those also who are leading the life of a samayin engaged in practising the code of conduct of the system, so is stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra.
ṣoḍaśādhāraṣaṭcakralakṣyatrayakhapañcakāt | kvacidanyataratrātha prāguktapaśukarmavat | praviśya mūlaṃ kandādeśchindannaikyavibhāvanāt | pūrṇāhutiprayogeṇa sveṣṭe dhāmni niyojayet |	- Cutting the sixteen loci of life namely, kula, visa, śākta, agni, pavana, ghata, sarvakāma, sañjivani, kūrma, lola, sudhādhāra, saumya, gaganābhoga, vidyākamal, cintāmani and nādi, six circles namely, nādi, māyā, yogi, bhedana, dipti, and śānta, three points of attention namely, antarlaksya, bahirlaksya and amā and the five spaces namely, ananta, kha, hrdvyoma, bindu and nāda or from anywhere else as well as the root of the kanda, etc.
jñānatriśūlaṃ saṃdīptaṃ dīptacakratrayojjvalam | cintayitvāmunā tasya vedanaṃ bodhanaṃ bhramam | dīpanaṃ tāḍanaṃ todaṃ calanaṃ ca punaḥ punaḥ | kandādicakragaṃ kuryādviśeṣeṇa hṛdambuje |	- Contemplating on the trident of knowledge as luminous and accordingluminosity to the triad of cakras should be understood, awakened, mobilised, ignited, incited, stricken at, taken round of again and again and brought to the circle of kanda, etc. particularly to the lotus of the heart.
dvādaśānte tataḥ kṛtvā binduyugmagate kṣipet | nirlakṣye vā pare dhāmni saṃyuktaḥ parameśvaraḥ |	Placing it at the end of the twelve finger-ends which is the meeting ground of the point of start and end of the process of breathing or on the highest point bindu of being which remains beyond indication where the soul gets united with the Supreme Lord.
na tasya kuryātsaṃskāra kaṃcidityāha gare | devaḥ kimasya pūrṇasya śrāddhādyairiti bhāvitaḥ |	- Initiation for Immediate Liberation It has been pointed in the Kulagahvara śāstra that the aspirant who has reached this state of his spiritual practice does not require the purifying rite for the sake of him including post-mortal offerings since he has become full in himself.
śrīmaddīkṣottare tveṣa vidhirvahnipuṭīkṛtaḥ | haṃsaḥ pumānadhastasya rudrabindusamanvitaḥ | śiṣyadehe niyojyaitadanudvignaḥ śataṃ japet | utkramyordhvanimeṣeṇa śiṣya itthaṃ paraṃ vrajet |	It has been observed in the Diksottara śāstra that by putting together the seed- sound of fire that is, r, h of the word hamsa, m of man and u of Rudra as rhum should be assigned to the body of the disciple and repeat it hundred times without any agitation in the mind. Consequently, the disciple has the possibility of departing upward from the body within a moment and reach the highest state of being.
eṣa eva vidhi śrīmatsiddhayogīśvarīmate | iyamutkrāmaṇī dīkṣā kartavyā yogino guroḥ |	- Application of the same method has been suggested by the Siddhayogiśvari Tantra. This initiation of departure from the body needs to be accorded only by the teacher who is accomplished in yogic practice.
anabhyastaprāṇacāraḥ kathamenāṃ kariṣyati | vakṣyamāṇāṃ brahmavidyāṃ sakalāṃ niṣkalombhitām | karṇe'sya vā paṭhedbhūyo bhūyo vāpyatha pāṭhayet | svayaṃ ca karma kurvīta tattvaśuddhayādikaṃ guruḥ |	How can he offer it who has not practised the system of movement of prāna? Alternatively, the teacher should utter this mantra close to the ear of the disciple again and again or even make the latter utter it himself while the teacher needs to keep himself busy with the act of purification of the essences as well as in making the disciple offer the final oblations to fire to the accompaniment of the force of mantra with the Supreme Being as its destination.
mantrakriyābalātpūrṇāhutyetthaṃ yājayetpare | yogābhyāsamakṛtvāpi sadyautkrāntidāṃ guruḥ |	-a Even a teacher who is not accomplished in yoga may be capable of offering this body-redeeming initiation by virtue of his knowledge of the secret of it, efficiency in the application of mantra and power of meditation.
dadyādyadāsya prāṇāḥ syurdhruvaṃ niṣkramaṇecchavaḥ | vināpi kriyayā bhāvibrahmavidyābalādguruḥ | karṇajāpaprayogeṇa tattvakañcukajālataḥ | niḥsārayanyathābhīṣṭe sakale niṣkale dvaye | tattve vā yatra kutrāpi yojayetpudgalaṃ kramāt | samayī putrako vāpi paṭhedvidyāmināṃ tathā |	b-a Even without going into performances of any rite, the teacher is capable of redeeming the disciple from the net of the intervening essences acting as a covering on his being, by means of his knowledge of the Ultimate Reality and through muttering of the mantra concerning it close to the ear of the disciple and associating his inner being with the states of sakala and niskala one after the other or whichsoever would have been desired by the candidate. b- In the absence of the teacher who is practising the relevant code of conduct of the School in the proximity of the teacher samayin and more so the kid- Initiation for Immediate Liberation disciple may perform this act.
tatpāṭhāttu samayyuktāṃ rudrāṃśāpattimaśnute | etau jape cādhyayane yasmādadhikṛtāvubhau | nādhyāpanopadeśe vā sa eṣo'dhyayanādṛte | paṭhatostvanayorvastusvabhāvāttasya sā gatiḥ |	By virtue of this performance by these associates of the teacher, the beneficiary of it attains the state of oneness with Rudra. This is so because both these associates of the teacher are very well authorised for muttering and reading the sacred text not, however, either for teaching or preaching besides studying. This is so because study is a part of their life.
yathā niṣiddhabhūtādikarmā mantraṃ smaransvayam | āviṣṭe'pi kvacinnaiti lopaṃ kartṛtvavarjanāt |	b- It is like the sorcerer remembering the mantra of his practice within himself, though being possessed by the sense of the mantra himself, does not get affected by it since he is not applying it to anyone.
yathā ca vācayaśāstraṃ samayī śūnyaveśmani | na lupyate tadantaḥ sthaprāṇivargopakārataḥ | tathā svayaṃ paṭhanneṣa vidyāṃ vastusvabhāvataḥ | tasminmukte na lupyate yato kiñcitkaro'tra saḥ |	As study of a text concerning any system of knowledge is naturally meant for the learning of learners of it, the learner of it does not get affected by the learning of it in any way other than getting command over it as he is not applying its effect on anyone else as the object of it. Thus, gets annulled the scriptural restraint that its system should not be articulated in the presence of those who are not initiated.
hanta kuḍyāgrato'pyasya niṣedhastvatha kathyate | paryudāsena yaḥ śrotumavadhārayituṃ kṣamaḥ |	- It is rather sad to extend the area of inaudibility of the mantras to walls also instead of keeping it confined to those only who can understand its sense and not entities like wall, insects, birds, etc.
sa evātra niṣiddho no kuḍyakīṭapatatriṇaḥ | tarhi pāṣāṇatulyo'sau vilīnendriyavṛttikaḥ | tasyāgre paṭhatastasya niṣedhollaṅghanā katham | sa tu vastusvabhāvena galitākṣo'pi budhyate | akṣānapekṣayaivāntaścicchaktyā svaprakāśayā | prāgdehaṃ kila tityakṣurnottaraṃ cādhitaṣṭhivān | |	-a There is no transgression of the restraint on recitation of mantra, as put by Sāstras, before the person lying on the death-bed on account of the fact that though his senses have stopped functioning and thus have rendered him outwardly into a slab of stone, inwardly there is introverted consciousness awake within him which is independent of the senses for its illumination as it is self-luminous and though not responding to sensory stimulations for the time being on account of willing to leave the body, his awareness has all the probabilities of being awakened following this state in the middle on account of the force of the mantra.
madhye prabodhakabalāt pratibudhyeta pudgalaḥ | mantrāḥ śabdamayāḥ śuddhavimarśātmatayā svayam | |	b-a Mantras comprise of words expressive of pure meaningful contemplation in close proximity of the Self as the source of consciousness.
arthātmanā cāvabhāntastadarthapratibodhakāḥ | tenāsya galitākṣasya prabodho jāyate svayam | |	Therefore, though the senses of the dying person are immune to respond to the stimulation coming to it, yet his consciousness remains awake to the idea communicated to him through the mantra of the meaning of the same nature.
svacitsamānajātīyamantrāmarśanasaṃnidhe | yathā hyalpajavo vāyuḥ sajātīyavimiśritaḥ |	-a Initiation for Immediate Liberation As air of slow motion becoming mixed up with that which is moving fast, it, too, becomes so, even so gets awakened the consciousness in deep sleep.
javī tathātmā saṃsuptāmarśo'pyevaṃ prabudhyate | prabuddhaḥ sa ca saṃjāto na cādīkṣita ucyate |	Having become awakened, now it cannot be characterised as uninitiated. Initiation is a form of culture which now he has been accorded with.
ata eva nijaṃ śāstraṃ paṭhati kvāpi sāmaye | tacchrutvā ko'pi dhanyaścenmucyate nāsya sā kṣati | śāstranindāṃ maiṣa kārṣīdvayoḥ pātityadāyinīm |	b-a Therefore, if any observer of the code of conduct reads the mantras relevant to the context hearing which someone gets redeemed, there is nothing wrong in it in regard to violation of the restraint of the Sāstra liable to condemn him on this ground.
ityevaṃparametannādīkṣitāgre paṭhediti | yathā ca samayī kāṣṭhe loṣṭe vā mantrayojanām | kurvaṃstasmiṃścalatyeti na lopaṃ tadvadatra hi | yato'sya pratyayaprāptiprepsoḥ samayinastathā |	This is why such a reading has been declared as leading to his straying away from the provision of readership of it. b-a As an apprentice of the code of conduct of the School if wanders applying the mantra to pieces of wood and clods is declared as a violator of the restraint of the Sāstra, such is not the case of violation here.
pravṛttasya svabhāvena tasminmukte na vai kṣatiḥ | sādhakastu sadā sādhye phale niyatiyantraṇāt |	b-a In this instance, on the contrary, since the apprentice of the code naturally wants to get confirmed in regard to the effect of the mantra, there is no harm in his use of it on one who is going to be liberated by the effect of it on him.
makṣikā śrutamantro'pi prāyaścittaucitīṃ caret | itthaṃ sadyaḥ samutkrāntiryoktā tāmājñayā guroḥ | samayyādirapi proktakāle proktārthasiddhaye | svayaṃ kuryātsamabhyastaprāṇacāragamāgamaḥ |	b-a Since the apprentice of the discipline is required to put restraint on himself so as to gain result in his venture, audibility of his articulation of the mantra even to a fly, needs atonement from him. b-a In this way, the applicant of the wisdom of immediate liberation be he even an apprentice of it, needs to make use of it only with the permission of his teacher under circumstances as defined already only for the definite purpose if he himself has gained efficiency through practice in the movement of in-breathing and out- breathing.
akṛtādhikṛtirvāpi guruḥ samayaśuddhaye | adhastanapadāvastho natu jñāneddhacetanaḥ |	On even being authorised to make use of his wisdom in this regard, if anyone does not make use of it for purification of anyone who deserves its application on him, he is considered as deserving some such status as that of vidyeśa instead of oneness with Śiva since he has not become fully enlightened in his consciousness.
itīyaṃ sadyautkrāntiḥ sūcitā mālinīmate | svayaṃ vā guruṇā vātha kāryatvena maheśinā |	b- This is how has been explained the method of application of the wisdom meant for immediate redemption from body in keeping with Lord Śiva's view of it as expressed in Mālinivijayottara Tantra. It can be applied by anyone on himself or through the teacher.
sarvaṃ bhogaṃ virūpaṃ tu matvā dehaṃ tyajedyadi | tadā tena krameṇāśu yojita samayī śivaḥ |	Initiation for Immediate Liberation All kinds of enjoyment abound in faults. Convinced of this, if the apprentice were to decide to leave the body, he, being offered this kind of initiation, is destined to become Śiva immediately.
ukteyaṃ sadyautkrāntiryā gopyā prāṇavabudhaiḥ | atha dīkṣāṃ bruve mūḍhajanāśvāsapradāyinīm |	Thus has been explained the procedure of initiation meant for according immediate liberation and, as such, needs to be kept secret like one's life-force prāṇa. CHAPTER - Process of Initiation of the Ignorant Now I am going talk about the process of initiation consolatory to the ignorant.
trikoṇe vahnisadane vahnivarṇojjvale'bhitaḥ | vāyavyapuranirdhūte kare savye sujājvale | bījaṃ kiṃcidgṛhītvaitattathaiva hṛdayāntare | kare ca dahyamānaṃ saccintayettajjapaikayuk | vahnidīpitaphaṭkāradhoraṇīdāhapīḍitam | bījaṃ nirbījatāmeti svasūtikaraṇākṣam |	Take a copper plate in the left hand, triangular in shape as the sacrificial vessel with fire burning in it and sending upward its flame due to blowing of air, take up seeds barley, wheat, etc. in the right hand and put them into the fire and bring the plate near to the level of heart and think of the seeds getting roasted in the fire of the vessel known as ghorani, muttering the mantra consisting of three seed-letters of fire, namely, ra ra ra combined with phat and show to the disciple how the seeds are getting roasted and are being rendered incapable of germination.
taptaṃ naitatprarohāya tenaiva pratyayena tu | malamāyākhyakarmāṇi mantradhyānakriyābalāt |	On the same analogy, all actions done under the fold of māyā and hence being maladroit become roasted by the fire of mantra, meditation and yogic practices become incapable of sprouting.
dagdhāni na svakāryāya nirbījapratyayaṃ tviṃmam | sa śrīmānsuprasanno me śaṃbhunātho nyarūpayat |	This elucidation was taught to me kindly by my revered teacher Sambhunatha.
bījasyāpyatra kāryā ca yojanā kṛpayā guroḥ | yato dīkṣā sudīptatvātsthāvarāṇyapi mocayet |	- This elucidation needs to be presented practically before the disciple by the teacher to demonstrate how even immobile entities may be liberated from the evil of germination by means of ignition of fire and not talk of full awakening of consciousness.
yo gururjapahomārcādhyānasiddhatvamātmani | jñātvā dīkṣāṃ carettasya dīkṣā sapratyayā smṛtā | avadhūte nirācāre tattvajñe natvayaṃ vidhiḥ | sācāraiḥ kriyate dīkṣā yā dṛṣṭapratyayānvitā |	Initiation offered by the teacher who is aware of the effect of it on account of having attained efficiency in it through muttering of mantras, offering of oblation to fire, worship and meditation, is said to be illucidatory sapratyayā. This kind of illucidatory initiation, however, should not be accorded to those who have renounced the world, are fully aware of the code of conduct of the system and are already aware of the Reality as such.
nirācāreṇa dīkṣāyāṃ pratyayastu na gadyate | jñānaṃ svapratyayaṃ yasmānna phalāntaramarhati |	-a Process of Initiation of the Ignorant Knowledge of self-convincement does not depend on any result while meditation, etc. depend on the consequence.

The quanta of these experiences themselves are expressive of the effect of spiritual values in the disciple concerned.
udbhavo laghubhāvena dehagrahatirohiteḥ | deho hi pārthivo mukhyastadā mukhyatvamujjhati |	b- Lightness comes due to elimination of weight which keeps the body attached to the earth owing to earthliness of it as the main factor which on being eliminated through the use of the mantra of weightlessness on him the disciple begins to float.

The word prati towards as used in the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra in this context amounts to mean ‘in the presence of for gaining his favour while the phrase tamārādhya having worshipped him is indicatory of attracting the favour of him out of his pleasure. - Sri Tantrāloka Due to getting associated with the teacher, notwithstanding even distantly, the candidate of initiation by virtue of the teacher's favour to him gets redeemed.

The entire circle should be illuminated wherein the disyllabic mantra needs to be all the more illuminated. The rest of the details are obvious.
śiṣṭaṃ spaṣṭamato neha kathitaṃ vistarātpunaḥ | kṛtvā maṇḍalamabhyarcya tatra devaṃ kuśairatha | gomayenākṛtiṃ kuryācchiṣyavattāṃ nidhāpayet | tatastasyāṃ śodhyamekamadhvānaṃ vyāptibhāvanāt |	Therefore, there is no necessity of elaboration on them. b-a Drawing a circle within the broader one and following the worship of Lord Siva there should be formed a figure of the dead made of clay cow-dung and kusa grass and established inside it as a similitude of the disciple supposing it as the candidate of purification himself on account of the pervasiveness of the path Initiation in Absentia Parokşa Diksā of mantra having considered the candidate in the form of its similitude as having arisen above the Prakrti, he should be taken as having reached the plane of the Purusa.
prakṛtyantaṃ vinikṣipya punarenaṃ vidhiṃ caret | mahājālaprayogeṇa sarvasmādadhvamadhyataḥ |	With the use of the technique of mahājāla he should be pulled out of all the lower paths in the form of his inner being citta in the shape of the figure.

This is known as the use of mahājāla, great trap, for capturing the desired spirit from within the vast space of the inner being clouded by the smoke of ignorance and yet the spirit concerned being made luminous by the force of the net of rays emerging from the mantra.
etenācchādanīyaṃ vrajati paravaśaṃ saṃmukhīnatvamādau | paścādānīyate cetsakalamatha tato'pyadhvamadhyādyatheṣṭam | ākṛṣṭāvuddhṛtau vā mṛtajanaviṣaye karṣaṇīye'tha jīve | yogaḥ śrīśaṃbhunāthāgamaparigamito jālanāmā mayoktaḥ |	Through the application of this device of the great trap the desired spirit is brought face to face before the teacher initially per force followed by its attraction from within the entire path as desired. As regards the technique of attraction and weaning out the spirit of the dead, it was taught to me by my revered teacher Śambhunātha.
ciravighaṭite senāyugme yathāmilite puna rhayagajanaraṃ svāṃ svāṃ jātiṃ rasādabhidhāvati | karaṇapavanairnāḍīcakraistathaiva samāgatai rnijanijarasādekībhāvyaṃ svajālavaśīkṛtaiḥ |	As a troop of armies having being disbanded long before and on being recalled, horses, elephants and soldiers of those of their respective regiments meet with one another filled with joy, even so waves of prānas flowing from within their respective channels primarily and secondarily meet together on account of having been captured in the trap.
mahājālasamākṛṣṭo jīvo vijñānaśālinā | svapretatiryaṅnirayāṃstadaivaiṣa vimuñcati | tajjñānamantrayogāptaḥ puruṣaścaiṣa kṛtrimam | yogīva sādhyahṛdayāttadā tādātmyamujjhati |	Just as being attracted by the wise teacher through the use of the great trap the spirit of the dead discards the impressions of the body from which it had departed, be it that of an animal or bird, etc., and returns to its prior yogic one, even so does the spirit of the dead concerned comes to the trap under the effect of the mantra.
sthāvarādidaśāścitrāstatsalokasamīpatāḥ| tyajecceti na citraṃ sa evaṃ yaḥ karmaṇāpi vā |	- There is nothing surprising in the abandonment of beings of their respective states, irrespective of the same being that of mobile or immobile, etc. and their respective loci having been assumed by them as a result of their previous deeds.

tasmindehe tu kāpyasya jāyate śāṅkarī parā | bhaktirūhācca vijñānādācāryādvāpyasevitāt |	Initiation in Absentia Parokşa Diksā In this body is born some kind of transcendental attraction towards Siva in the form of devotion, reasoning, wisdom and insight of the teacher even without having been served.
taddehasaṃsthito'pyeṣa jīvo jālabalādimam | dārbhādidehaṃ vyāpnoti svādhiṣṭhityāpyacetayan |	In response to this question what Abhinava states is as follows : In spite of continuing to remain in his actual body, the spirit of the person concerned has the possibility of embodying the similitude of himself in the circle made of kuśa, etc.
yogamantrakriyājñānabhūyobalavaśātpunaḥ | manuṣyadehamapyeṣa tadaivāśu vimuñcati | suptakalpo'pyadeho'pi yo jīvaḥ so'pi jālataḥ | ākṛṣṭo dārbhamāyāti dehaṃ phalamayaṃ ca vā |	It is also possible that while on one hand his initiation is getting conducted through the use of yoga, mantra, performance of the rite, and application of the relevant wisdom of redemption, on the other he may happen to leave quickly his body itself. In such a situation even though almost asleep and bereft of body, under the attraction of the trap his spirit comes to the body of the kuśa which makes him avail of the result of the initiation also.
jātīphalādi yatkicittena vā dehakalpanā | antarbahirdvayaucityāttadatrotkṛṣṭamucyate | |	On account of its appropriateness internally as well as externally, it would be supposed to be the best.
tato jālakramānītaḥ sa jīva suptavatsthitaḥ | manoviśiṣṭadehādisāmagrīprāptyabhāvataḥ |	Sri Tantrāloka Being captured and brought through the trap, the spirit concerned remains almost asleep due to lack of body, senses and manas.
na spandate na jānāti na vakti na kilecchati | tādṛśasyaiva saṃskārān sarvān prāgvatprakalpayet |	It neither moves, nor knows, nor speaks, nor has any wish. Therefore, the teacher needs to assume all these actions in him in keeping with his such responses made earlier and design the rites accordingly.
nirbījadīkṣāyogena sarvaṃ kṛtvā puroditam | vidhiṃ yojanikāṃ pūrṇāhutyā sākaṃ kṣipecca tam | dārbhādidehe mantrāgnāvarpite pūrṇayā saha | muktapāśaḥ śivaṃ yāti punarāvṛttivarjitaḥ | |	- By way of offering to him the seedless initiation, the teacher should perform all the rites as stated already. He needs to offer to fire the unitarian oblation along with the symbolic body made of kuśa, etc. Being offered to fire in this symbolic form, he gets redeemed from bondage and reaches Śiva not to return. - That initiation is consolatory in which the symbolic figure made of kuśa shows some sort of movement in it.
sapratyayā tviyaṃ yatra spandate darbhajā tanuḥ | tatra prāṇamanomantrārpaṇayogāttathā bhavet | |	This is due to the effect of the imposition of prāna and manas on it by means of application of the mantra.
sābhyāsasya tadapyuktaṃ balāśvāsi na tatkṛte | mṛtoddhāroditaireva yathāsambhūti hetubhiḥ | | jīvatparokṣadīkṣāpi kāryā nirbījikā tu sā | tasyāṃ darbhākṛtiprāyakalpane jālayogataḥ | |	This happens due to the person concerned having been active for attainment of Siva-hood or owing to the effect of the initiator himself. -a Initiation in Absentia Parokşa Diksā Kindred to this kind of initiation known as salvationary of the dead, is salvationary of the living which possibly is seedless. In it also the representative figure is made of kuśa and the great trap of mantra is used with due quantum of will to trap him as if his soul had departed.
saṅkalpamātreṇākarṣo jīvasya mṛtibhītitaḥ | śiṣṭaṃ prāgvatkuśādyutthākāraviploṣavarjitam | pārimityādanaiśvaryātsādhye niyatiyantraṇāt | jālākṛṣṭirvinābhyāsaṃ rāgadveṣānna jāyate |	b- The teacher is liable to fail in trapping the spirit of the dead by means of the net of the mantra due to limitations of his efficiency for the task, lack in his spiritual elevation, occupancy of the covering kañcūka in his inner being and the effect of either attachment or detachment towards the person whose soul is intended to be captured.
parokṣa evātulyābhirdīkṣābhiryadi dīkṣitaḥ | tatrottaraṃ syādbalavatsaṃskārāya tvadhastanam |	If initiation in absentia were to be accomplished at several places of one and the same person at different levels, the higher would prevail over lower ones and turn effective while the lesser one would serve as a means to it.
bhuktiyojanikāyāṃ tu bhūyobhirgurubhistathā | kṛtāyāṃ bhogavaicitryaṃ hetuvaicitryayogataḥ | parokṣadīkṣaṇe māyottīrṇe bhogāya yojayet | bhogānīpsā durlabhā hi satī vā bhogahānaye |	If the object of initiation were to be enjoyment accomplished at several places by different teachers of one and the same School, the result would be a variety of enjoyments having the possibility of being made available to the person concerned. Śrī Tantrāloka If the person to be initiated in absentia would have spiritually risen above allurement māyā of all kinds, and yet were initiated for enjoyment, the effect of enjoyment would get annulled as detachment from enjoyment is a rare virtue and hence more powerful.
uktaṃ hi svānyasaṃvittyoḥ svasaṃvidbalavattarā | bādhakatve bādhikāsau sāmyaudāsīnyayostathā |	In any confrontation between one's own level of consciousness and anyone else’s including the teacher's, it is one's own consciousness which proves more powerful.
śrīmān dharmaśivo'pyāha pārokṣyāṃ karmapaddhatau | parokṣadīkṣaṇe samyak pūrṇāhutividhau yadi | | agniściṭiciṭāśabdaṃ sadhūmaṃ pratimuñcati | dhatte nīlāmbudacchāyāṃ muhurjvalati śāmyati | vistaro ghorarūpaśca mahīṃ dhāvati cāpyadhaḥ | dhvāṃkṣādya śravyaśabdo vā tadā taṃ lakṣayedguruḥ |	In case of teacher's consciousness being inclined towards enjoyment and the disciple's towards redemption, it is the disciple's which overpowers the teacher's. ācārya Dharmasiva has observed as follows regarding the action in the fire at the time of initiation in absentia: “While making the final offering to fire in course of initiation in absentia if the fire produces the sound cit cit along with smoke, makes the appearance of the casting of blue cloud, burns and subsides momentarily, spreads its flame all around and moves downward or produces the sound like the noise of a crow, the teacher should mark it carefully.
brahmahatyādibhiḥ pāpaistatsaṅgaiścopapātakaiḥ | tadā tasya na kartavyā dīkṣāsminnakṛte vidhau | navātmā phaṭpuṭāntaḥsthaḥ punaḥ pañcaphaḍanvitaḥ | amukasyeti pāpāni dahāmyanu phaḍaṣṭakam | iti sāhastriko homaḥ kartavyastilataṇḍulaiḥ | ante pūrṇā ca dātavyā tato'smai dīkṣayā guruḥ |	The candidate might have done any such heinous crime as murder of a brāhmana and the like and, therefore, the rite of initiation should be stopped." - Initiation in Absentia Paroksa Diksā Then the teacher needs to assume the role of Śiva Himself in His nine forms namely, niṣkala, sakala, māyā-tritaya, kālaniyati, rāga, pradhāna, buddhi, vidyā and pārthiva and having placed himself between phat and put along with five phat sounds of mantra should pronounce “I am burning the crimes of the disciple of so and so name", needs to end in eight phat mantras with the climax in the offering of one thousand oblations of tila and rice followed by the final offering.
parayojanaparyantaṃ kuryāttattvaviśodhanam| pratyakṣe'pi sthitasyāṇoḥ pāpino bhagavanmayīm |	Through this performance the disciple is supposed to have got rid of his entire blemish and been made worthy of being associated with the Transcendent.
śakti prāptavato jyeṣṭhāmevameva vidhiṃ caret | yadi vā daiśika samyaṅ na dīptastasya tatpurā | prāyaścittaistathā dānaiḥ prāṇāyāmaiśca śodhanam | kṛtvā vidhimimāṃ cāpi dīkṣāṃ kuryādaśaṅkitaḥ | |	- a This best kind of rite is applicable to candidates present physically also who have obtained the force of the Divine. b-a In case of the initiator himself not being so brilliant, he needs to be so by means of atonements, gifts on his behalf and practice of breath-control prior to performance of this rite without any doubt.
sarvathā vartamāno'pi tattvavinmocayetpaśūna | icchayaiva śivaḥ sākṣāttasmāttaṃ pūjayetsadā |	Being thus purified and christened in his awareness he may bring liberation to individuals through his actual presence in this form as Śiva deserving always worship as such.
śāṭhyaṃ tatra na kāryaṃ ca tatkṛtvādho vrajecchiśuḥ | ca na punaḥ kīrtayettasya pāpaṃ kīrtayitā vrajet |	b- Sri Tantrāloka Following his initiation, the disciple should not do anything objectionable including condemnation of the teacher.
nirayaṃ varjayettasmāditi dīkṣottare vidhiḥ | eṣā parokṣadīkṣā dvidhoditā jīvaditarabhedena | liṅgoddhārākhyāmatha vacmaḥ śivaśāsanaikanirdiṣṭām |	Having done so, he has the danger of going down to hell. This has the potentiality of making one escape the danger of going to hell. Thus has been recounted the rite of initiation in both its forms, relating to living as well as dead. - CHAPTER - Initiation in Raising the Emblem of Śiva Lingoddharana Diksā Now I am going to speak about initiation in raising the emblem linga of Siva.
uktaṃ śrīmālinītantre kila pārthivadhāraṇām | uktvā yo yojito yatra sa tasmānna nivartate |	It has been stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra that one who has been taught this earthly meditation, does not turn back from it.
yogyatāvaśasaṃjātā yasya yatraiva śāsanā| sa tatraiva niyoktavyo dīkṣākāle tatastvasau |	One needs to be encouraged to follow the same practice at the time of initiation which he may be capable of in keeping with his capability.
phalaṃ sarvaṃ samāsādya śive yukto'pavṛjyate | ayukto'pyūrdhvasaṃśuddhiṃ saṃprāpya bhuvaneśataḥ | śuddha śivatvamāyāti dagdhasaṃsārabandhanaḥ | uktvā puṃdhāraṇāṃ coktametadvaidāntikaṃ mayā |	As regards the devotion to Siva, following this line of practice, the devotee gets fulfilled in all his aspirations and by becoming redeemed of all his vices and being thus Śrī Tantrāloka purged of them, the aspirant attains purity by the grace of Śiva, even though not exclusively devoted to Him. - Being purged of his ills, he attains Siva-hood having got burnt all the bonds keeping him tied to the world.
kapilāya purā proktaṃ prathame paṭale tathā | anena kramayogena saṃprāptaḥ paramaṃ padam | na bhūyaḥ paśutāmeti śuddhe svātmani tiṣṭhati | ato hi dhvanyate'rtho'yaṃ śivatattvādhareṣvapi |	Having talked of meditation on the Purusa, herein is explained by me the Vedāntic mode of meditation. I have talked about it to Kapila in the first Chapter of the Siddhayogiśvari Tantra by means of which he attained the status of the Supreme and does not descend to animality any more, remaining fulfilled within himself.
tattveṣu yojitasyāsti punaruddharaṇīyatā | samastaśāstrakathitavastuvaiviktyadāyinaḥ |	-a It is suggested by this statement that there is the possibility of redemption of those even who have remained committed to lesser ways until now.
śivāgamasya sarvebhyo'pyāgamebhyo viśiṣṭatā| śivajñānena ca vinā bhūyo'pi paśutodbhavaḥ |	This is the speciality of Śaivism over and above all other Sāstras that except for knowledge of Śiva there is the danger of reverting to the animal nature.
kramaśca śaktisaṃpāto mahalāniryiyāsutā | dīkṣā bodho heyahānirupādeyalayātmatā | bhogyatvapāśavatyāgaḥ patikartṛtvasaṃkṣayaḥ | svātmasthitiścetyevaṃ hi darśanāntarasaṃsthiteḥ |	b- Initiation in Raising the Emblem of Śiva Following are the steps of emergence from lower positions of other philosophical standpoints for attainment of Śiva-hood under the inspiration of Śiva and the śakti: descent of grace, getting purged of blemishes, willingness to approach the teacher, getting initiated, awareness of the higher ranges of the reality, getting rid of what needs to be abandoned, coming to the wave-length of what is aspired for, getting relieved of the desire for enjoyment and animality, relinquishment of ownership and doership and restoration to self-hood.
proktamuddharaṇīyatvaṃ śivaśaktīritasya hi | atha vaiṣṇavabauddhāditantrāntādharavartinām |	-a Anyone from amongst those also has the possibility of being uplifted to the status of Śiva who until now had been lying on the lower steps of Vaisnavism, Buddhism, etc.

Now, under your stimulation he wishes to take resort to you .
acirāttvanmayībhūya bhogaṃ mokṣaṃ prapadyatām | evamastvityathājñāṃ ca gṛhītvā vratamasya tat | apāsyāmbhasi nikṣipya snapayedanurūpataḥ | snātaṃ saṃprokṣayedarghapātrāmbhobhiranantaram |	Kindly be compassionate to him as a result of which he may not have to atone for the mistake of desertion of the School and soon may become one with you getting granted to him the state of enjoyment or liberation as per his worth.” b-a Having obtained the permission of Śiva, he should be made to bathe himself in keeping with the tradition followed by being drenched with the sacred water.
pañcagavyaṃ dantakāṣṭhaṃ tatastasmai samarpayet | tatastaṃ baddhanetraṃ ca praveśya praṇipātayet |	After this, he should be given pañcagavaya five products of cow and the tooth- stick. Then with his eyes closed he should be led to the ground of worship and made to bow before the Deity.

Associating the name of the disciple with the purified mantra, the teacher should pronounce as follows: krim name of the disciple hrim prāyaścittam śodhayāmi phaṭ svāhā I am purifying the entire rite.

ajñācāryamukhāyātaṃ nirvīryaṃ mantrameva yat | japtavānsa guruścātra nādhikāryuktadūṣaṇāt |	b- Since the mantra he had been muttering during the entire period of his stay in the proximity of that ignorant teacher was ineffective basically, the teacher himself needs to be blamed in this case and by no means the candidate.
tato'sya śuddhiṃ prākkṛtvā tato dīkṣāṃ samācaret | adhodarśanasaṃsthena guruṇā dīkṣitaḥ purā | |	Therefore, the candidate needs to be purged of all his previous impressions before being initiated.

uktaṃ ca śrīmate śāstre tatra tatra ca bhūyasā | āmodārthī yathā bhṛṅgaḥ puṣpātpuṣpāntaraṃ vrajet |	- It has been observed in the Srimat śāstra at several places abundantly that as a black bee hornet moves from flower to flower for the sake of smell or nectar, even so the disciple under the aspiration for knowledge needs to move from one teacher to another.
vijñānārthī tathā śiṣyo gurorgurvantaraṃ tviti | gurūṇāṃ bhūyasāṃ madhye yato vijñānamuttamam | prāptaṃ so'sya gururdīkṣā nātra mukhyā hi saṃvidi | sarvajñānanidhānaṃ tu guruṃ saṃprāpya susthitaḥ |	As a matter of justification for this kind of transgression of faithfulness towards a particular teacher is the point that in receiving initiation from several teachers, it is the true and profound knowledge he gets transmitted to him which serves as the teacher and real form of initiation. -a Initiation in Raising the Emblem of Siva Having received the real stock of knowledge, the wise disciple needs to honour it as his teacher by moving from teacher to teacher under the motivation of acquisition of it.

In view of Abhinavagupta the teacher needs to be learned in the formation and meaning of words, sentences, validity of statements, aware of the sense of all the methodical texts on Saivism besides being compassionate towards disciples.
na svayaṃbhūstasya coktaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ parameśinā | abhakto jīvitadhiyā kurvannīśānadhiṣṭhitaḥ | paśvātmanā svayaṃbhūṣṇurnādhikārī ca kutracit | bhasmāṅkuro vratisuto duḥśīlātanayastathā |	According to the Deviyāmala Tantra as instructed by Lord Śiva, such a person does not deserve to be honoured as a teacher who has declared himself as a teacher, lacking in devotion to Śiva and yet for the sake of earning his livelihood Rite of Sacred Bath has appointed himself as a teacher of Saivism with all the instincts of animality dominating in his thoughts and behaviour.

anādṛtyaiva saṃpūrṇajñānaṃ kuryādgururgurum | prāgvatsaṃpūjya hutvā ca śrāvayitvā cikīrṣitam |	b-a Therefore, leaving apart consideration of province, family, tradition, and bodily features, one should give priority to the integrality of knowledge of the person going to be accepted as one's teacher. b-a As explained already, the disciple should offer oblation to fire and communicate his aspiration to the teacher.
tato'bhiṣiñcettaṃ śiṣyaṃ catuḥṣaṣṭyā tataḥ sakṛt | tanmantrarasatoyena pūrvoktavidhinā guruḥ | vibhavena suvistīrṇaṃ tatastasmai vadetsvakam | sarvaṃ kartavyasāraṃ yacchāstrāṇāṃ paramaṃ rahaḥ |	This is to be followed by the teacher bathing the disciple with water enforced by mantra and contained in sixty-four vessels altogether as stated already.

anugrāhyāstvayā śiṣyā śivaśaktipracoditāḥ | uktaṃ jñānottare caitadbrāhmaṇāḥ kṣatriyāḥ viśaḥ | napuṃsakāḥ striyaḥ śūdrā ye cānye'pi tadarthinaḥ| te dīkṣāyāṃ na mīmāṃsyā jñānakāle vicārayet |	b-a Rite of Sacred Bath It has been observed in the Jñānottara Tantra that irrespective of the candidates being Brāhmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, invalids, women, Sūdras and anyone else of this kind having come to receive the initiation, needs not to be subjected to examination on the occasion of initiation but on that of the trial of knowledgeability.

yathecchaṃ vicared vyākhyādīkṣādau yantraṇojjhitaḥ | kurvanna bādhyate yasmāddīpāddīpavadīdṛśaḥ |	However, if he continues to remain doing all this, there is no harm in it, in the same way as in lighting lamps with a particular one without the same getting any way diminished in its power of illumination.

yathārthamupadeśaṃ tu kurvannācārya ucyate | na cāvajñā kriyākāle saṃsāroddharaṇaṃ prati |	As such, he should not show any kind of negligence in the performance of his duty which is so important as to lead people to redemption from the burden of birth and death.
na dīkṣeta guruḥ śiṣyaṃ tattvayuktastu garvataḥ | yo'sya syānnarake vāsa iha ca vyādhito bhavet |	Being knowledgeable, if any teacher were not to initiate anyone just out of his pride of knowledgeability, he would suffer the life of hell or at least has the risk of getting diseased.

Here it enters into the starting point of the three channels of the life-force known as idā, pingalā and susumnā Having filled up that highest centre of heart with concentration of consciousness, the aspirant needs to contemplate on the essence of the mantra luminous as a flame of the subterranean fire manifesting itself via eyes, apertures of body including hair all over the body.
mūlakandanabhonābhihṛtkaṇṭhālikatālugam | ardhendurodhikānādatadantavyāpiśaktigam |	This flame spreading from the navel up to the crest has been consuming the stuff of life with the help of life-breaths prāņa and apāna serving as oblation of clarified butter.
samanonmanaśuddhātmaparacakrasamāśritam | yatra yatra japeccakre samastavyastabhedanāt | tatra tatra mahāmantra iti devyākhyayāmale | vidyāvratamidaṃ proktaṃ mantravīryaprasiddhaye | |	It is via meditation on this sacrificial function being carried out by Nature in the cave of his inner being that the disciple needs to mutter the mantras inaudibly so that they can be enflamed, ripened, purified and become effective in yielding the fruit of liberation. - The Deviyāmala Tantra has pointed out that the mantra concerned gets transformed into the great mantra if muttered inaudibly along the route of the cakras known as mūlādhāra, kanda, navel, heart, throat, palate, half-moon, rodhikā, nāda, nādānta, sakti, samanā, unmanā and pure supernal cakra, matter as a whole or in the form of its seed-syllable.

Having gone through this process, mantras become omniscient and effective and as easily manageable as the organs of the body.
kuryādyogyeṣu śiṣyeṣu nāyogyeṣu kadācana | rahasye yojayedvipraṃ parīkṣya viparītataḥ |	b-a If the candidate of initiation be a follower of the Vedic tradition, he should be initiated only after making him pass through a practical examination contrary to his erstwhile practice concerning his amenability to the Saiva system of discipline and not otherwise.
ācārācchaktimapyevaṃ nānyathetyūrmiśāsane | nityādyalpālpakaṃ kuryādyaduktaṃ brahmāmale | cīrṇavidyāvrataḥ sarvaṃ manasā vā smaretpriye | dehasaṃbandhasaṃchannasārvajñyo dambhabhājanam |	This is the view of the Urmi Sāstra. b-a Rite of Sacred Bath According to the view of the Brahma Yāmala Tantra, the disciple needs to continue to remain practising regularly, no matter in the least measure, such ceremonies as worship of the Nityās. If he be such as has gone through the vow of wisdom, he may get accomplished in it by just bringing it to his memory, O Dear observes Siva to Pārvati.
avidandīkṣamāṇo'pi na duṣyedaiśika kvacit | jñātvā tvayogyatā nainaṃ dīkṣeta pratyavāyitām | buddhvā jñāne śāstrasiddhigurutvādau ca taṃ punaḥ | bhūya eva parīkṣeta tattadaucityaśālinam |	On becoming cognisant of it, the teacher should not accord initiation to such candidates as it is full of hazards. b- Having understood his knowledgeability, competence in yoga, ability to carry out the responsibility of the teacher, etc. he should be examined again and again to determine whether he is worthy or not in these respects. For this, the teacher should engage him in these tasks carefully to avoid any mistake in the judgement.
tatra tatra niyuñjīta natu jātu viparyayāt | nanu tadvastvayogyasya tatrecchā jāyate kutaḥ |	-a Now the problem is regarding the source of stimulation of the desire in the candidate concerned for the objective he was practically incapable of at present. If the source of this desire in him is determined as the wish of the Lord Himself.
tadīśādhiṣṭhitecchaiva yogyatāmasya sūcayet |	it Sri Tantrāloka is this source of the desire in him, which needs to be considered as his worthiness.
satyaṃ kāpi prabuddhāsāvicchā rūḍhiṃ na gacchati | vidyudvatpāpaśīlasya yathā pāpāpavarjane | rūḍhyarūḍhī tadicchāyā api śaṃbhuprasādataḥ |	b-a It is true that an aspiration may arise in someone only temporarily not to stay with any measure of durability as the desire in the criminal to get rid of criminality, like the flash of lightning. Durability and fickleness of the aspiration in him also, however, are dependent on the grace of the Lord.
aprarūḍhatathecchākastata eva na bhājanam | yaḥ samyagjñānamādāya guruviśvāsavarjitaḥ | lokaṃ viplāvayennāsmiāte vijñānamarpayet | ajñāte'pi punarjñāte vijñānaharaṇaṃ caret |	b- The candidate in whom the aspiration for the real knowledge of forging oneness with Siva has not got rooted in any sense, does not deserve to be confided with this secret knowledge, as having received it from the teacher without any faith in him, he is likely to misuse it in the society for some ulterior gain. Therefore, he need not be accepted for initiation in the School.
punaḥ punaryadā jñāto viśvāsaparivarjitaḥ | tadā tamagrato dhyāyetsphurantaṃ candrasūryavat | tato nijahṛdambhojabodhāmbarataloditām | svarbhānumalināṃ dhyāyedvāmāṃ śaktiṃ vimohanīm | vāmācārakrameṇaināṃ niḥsṛtāṃ sādhyagāminīm | cintayitvā tayā grastaprakāśaṃ taṃ vicintaye |	If he has been initiated out of ignorance of his true character, this knowledge should be taken back from him. - Having known him as indulging in acts of ungratefulness again and again, the teacher should meditate him as the lunar or solar disc lying before him and being engulfed by the lunar or solar eclipse having emerged from the space of comprehension of the lotus of his heart contrary to its luminosity and be overpowering it. - Rite of Sacred Bath Using this technique of vāmācāra reversed form of spiritual practice thinking of it as directed to its object, he should contemplate on the disc as bereft of its luminosity.
anena kramayogena mūḍhabuddherdurātmanaḥ| vijñānamantravidyādyāḥ prakurvantyapakāritām |	By the use of this device against that foolish disciple bent upon misuse of his learning should be rendered ineffective.
nanu vijñānamātmasthaṃ kathaṃ hartuṃ kṣamaṃ bhavet | ato vijñānaharaṇaṃ kathaṃ śrīpūrva ucyate | ucyate nāsya śiṣyasya vijñānaṃ rūḍhimāgatam| tathātve haraṇaṃ kasmātpūrṇayogyatvaśālinaḥ | kiṃtveṣa vāmayā śaktyā mūḍho gāḍhaṃ vibhoḥ kṛtaḥ | svabhāvādeva tenāsya vidyādyamapakārakam | |	- Now, the question is as follows: How is it possible to draw back the knowledge which had become through assimilation to oneself as a part of it? The answer as offered by the śāstra of the system is as follows: If the knowledge concerned had gone deep to the inmost being of the disciple who had been considered as worthy of it, the withdrawal of it from him would have been rather impossible. The point of relief, however, is that he happened to be rendered foolish through the force of reversal of the Lord. Naturally enough, therefore, the learning concerned on account of its liability to misuse could not go deep to his inmost being.
guruḥ punaḥ śivābhinnaḥ sanyaḥ pañcavidhāṃ kṛtim | kuryādyadi tataḥ pūrṇamadhikāritvamasya tat |	Since the teacher had become one with Siva and therefore possessed of all five capabilities of Him including concealment besides creation, sustenance, destruction and showering of grace, he is fully capable of taking it back from the disciple.
ato yathā śuddhatattvasṛṣṭisthityormalātyaye | yojanānugrahe kāryacatuṣke'dhikṛto guruḥ |	- As per the functions of Śiva in regard to the universe, the teacher can exercise all these four capabilities in regard to the pure essence including creation, sustenance, removal of blemishes, offer and withdrawal of grace.
śivābhedena tatkuryāttadvatpañcamamapyayam | tirobhāvābhidhaṃ kṛtyaṃ tathāsau śivatātmakaḥ | |	On account of his oneness with Śiva, he has every right to exercise his capability of concealment.
ata eva śive śāstre jñāne cāśvāsabhājanam | gurormūḍhatayā kopadhāmāpi na tirohitaḥ |	Therefore, in Saivism, on account of its being entirely the source of consolation, there is no place for anger even against the disciple rejected by the teacher on account of his foolishness.
gururhi kupito yasya sa tirohita ucyate | saṃsārī satu devo hi gururna ca mṛṣāvidaḥ |	The disciple is known as rejected on whom the teacher has become angry on account of his worldly interests while the teacher is Divine on account of his faithfulness to his wisdom.
tata eva ca śāstrādidūṣako yadyapi krudhā | na dahyate'sau guruṇā tathāpyeṣa tirohitaḥ |	Therefore, the disciple misusing the Sāstra and hence practically deserving the anger of the teacher does not get burnt except for getting rejected.
asmadgurvāgamastveṣa tirobhūte svayaṃ śiśau | na kupyenna śapeddhīmān sa hyanugrāhakaḥ sadā |	This is the instruction of our teacher that the wise teacher should neither be angry nor curse a disciple beyond rejecting him as he is expected to remain always merciful towards all including his disciples.
īśecchācoditaḥ pāśaṃ yadi kaṇṭhe nipīḍayet | kimācāryeṇa tatrāsya kāryā syātsahakāritā | śivābhinno'pi hi gururanugrahamayīṃ vibho | mukhyāṃ śaktimupāsīno'nugṛhṇīyātsa sarvathā |	- Rite of Sacred Bath Under the stimulation of the wish of the Lord, if anyone were to tighten the noose around his neck, how can the goodwill of the teacher be helpful to him in this state of things? The teacher is non-different from Siva on account of his remaining always engaged in the worship of the compassionate figure of Him. He is, therefore, expected to remain so in his behaviour.
svātantryamātrajñaptyai tu kathitaṃ śāstraṃ īdṛśam | na kāryaṃ patatāṃ hastālamba sahyo na pātanam |	This kind of Śāstra is meant for promotion of pure autonomy. Therefore the follower of it is expected neither to help those who are falling from their responsibility towards it nor to promote those who are falling from its following.
ata eva svatantratvādicchāyāḥ punarunmukham | prāyaścittairviśodhyainaṃ dīkṣeta kṛpayā guru |	As such, appreciating the autonomy of will-power of the disciple inclined towards it, the teacher needs to initiate him having kindly purified him through atonement.

Sri Tantrāloka Having had to take recourse to a degrading kind of discipline and getting discontented with it, if he were to come to a upward-looking discipline and get redeemed of his sin, he has the possibility of becoming one with Siva.
rājñe druhyannamātyāṅgabhūto'pi hi vihanyate | viparyayastu netyevamūrdhvā dṛṣṭiṃ samāśrayet |	Having committed crime to the king and taking resort to his minister gets punished but not the other way round. Therefore, it is imperative for anyone to look upward.
śrīpūrvaśāstre tenoktaṃ yāvattenaiva noddhṛtaḥ | atra hyartho'yametāvatpūrvoktajñānavṛhitaḥ | |	This is the instruction of the Mālinivijayottara Tantra expressed there through the term 'by him' could not be saved. The same instruction is intended to be imparted here as well where the word 'by him' refers to the teacher Mālini XVIII..
gurustāvatsa evātra tacchabdenāvamṛśyate | tādṛksvabhyastavijñānabhājordhvapadaśālinā | anuddhṛtasya na śreya etadanyagurūddhṛteḥ | ata evāmbujanmārkadṛṣṭānto'tra nirūpitaḥ |	-a In the same way, that disciple does not attain redemption who has been sought to be raised upward by a lower category of teacher and not by one who has uplifted himself by means of his practice of the wisdom. This is the import of the analogy of the lotus and the sun in the context concerned of the text titled Parātrisika.
trijagajjyotiṣo hyanyattejo'nyacca niśākṛtaḥ | jñānamanyattrikaguroranyattvadharavartinām | |	b- Different is the light of the sun illuminating all the three worlds and different that of the illuminator of the night. Likewise, different is the knowledge of a teacher of the Trika system and different of those of other lower category of systems.
ata eva purābhūtagurvabhāvo yadā tadā | tadanyaṃ lakṣaṇopetamāśrayetpunarunmukhaḥ | sati tasmiṃstūnmukhaḥ sankasmājjahyādyadi sphuṭam| syādanyatarago doṣo yo'dhikārāpaghātakaḥ |	Rite of Sacred Bath Therefore in case of unavailability of the teacher of the primeval category = Siva, the disciple aspiring for getting uplifted needs to take resort to one who be imbued with the same qualification and capable of uplifting him. In case of availability of such a teacher why may an aspirant of liberation be impelled to commit the fault of deserting him.
doṣaśceha na lokastho doṣatvena nirūpyate | ajñānakhyāpanāyuktakhyāpanātmā tvasau mataḥ |	The fault under reference here is not worldly. It is the fault of ignorance, non- communication, communication of the inappropriate which is meant here.
śiṣyasyāpi tathābhūtajñānānāśvastarūpatā | mukhyo doṣastadanye hi doṣāstatprabhavā yataḥ |	Another fault meant here is the disciple's lack of being convinced with whatever has been communicated to him. The main fault, however, lies in the bad effects these faults are prone to produce.
na dhvastavyādhika ko hi bhiṣajaṃ bahu manyate | asūyurnūnamadhvastavyādhiḥ svasthāyate balāt |	There is no one who having got cured of his disease is not liable to give its credit to the physician unless out of his jealousy towards him he considers himself as having got cured by means of his own potentiality.
evaṃ jñānasamāśvastaḥ kiṃ kiṃ na gurave caret | no cennūnamaviśvasto viśvasta iva tiṣṭhati |	In the same way, who may be that disciple who having received knowledge convincing to him from the teacher may not be prepared to do whatever for the welfare of the teacher.
ajñānādaya evaite doṣā laukikā guroḥ | iti khyāpayituṃ proktaṃ mālinīvijayottere | |	- All the faults of the teacher hinted at previously such as ignorance, etc. are not worldly. Whatever has been stated in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra in this regard is intended to bring home this fact to the disciple.
na tasyānveṣayedvṛttaṃ śubhaṃ vā yadi vāśubham | sa eva tadvijānāti yuktaṃ cāyuktameva vā |	As regards the faults of worldly nature the disciple need not try to go into them be they auspicious or inauspicious, as the teacher himself knows what is appropriate and what is not.
akāryeṣu yadā saktaḥ prāṇadravyāpahāriṣu | tadā nivāraṇīyo'sau praṇatena vipaścitā |	- If, however, he engages in such heinous crimes as killing or stealing, he should be warned against these propensities gently by the wise disciple.
viśeṣaṇamakāryāṇāmuktābhiprāyameva yat | tenātivāryamāṇo'pi yadyasau na nivartate | tadānyatra kvacidgatvā śivamevānucintayet | na hyasya sa gurutve syāddoṣo yenoṣare kṛṣim |	As is self-evident from the adjectives used herein for such a prohibited deed, if even being warned against his engagement in them, he does not desist himself from his indulgence in them, the disciple needs to go elsewhere and contemplate on Śiva Himself. -a Rite of Sacred Bath In such a situation, the disciple will not be liable to have committed the fault of desertion of the teacher.
kuryādvrajenniśāyāṃ vā sa tvarthaprāṇahārakaḥ | tadīyāpriyabhīrustu paraṃ tādṛśamācaret | |	Rather his stay with that teacher any longer would have been to sow seed in a barren land or to travel at night amounting to taking the risk of life.
yatastadapriyaṃ naiṣaśṛṇuyāditi bhāṣitam | śrīmātaṅge taduktaṃ ca nādhītaṃ bhūmabhītitaḥ |	The same has been stated in the Mātanga śāstra also which is not being quoted here out of the fear of lengthening the discourse.
yaccaiduktametāvatkartavyamiti taddhruvam | | tīvraśaktigṛhītānāṃ svayameva hṛdi sphuret | upadeśastvayaṃ mandamadhyaśakternijāṃ kramāt | śakti jvalayituṃ proktaḥ sā hyevaṃ jājvalītyalam |	b- The suggestion in the foregoing statement that he should go elsewhere and meditate on Siva, amounts to suggest that being imbued with intense aspiration, he may get the germ of real knowledge sprout from within his heart by itself. So far as are concerned those who are possessed of low or mild category of spiritual capability, they too should brighten the same through this device as much as possible.
dṛḍhānurāgasubhagasaṃrambhābhogabhāginaḥ | svollāsi smarasarvasvaṃ dāḍharyāyānyatra dṛśyate |	- This is something like attraction between a male and a female getting intensified into love and conjugal relationship culminating automatically into physical contact resulting in exquisite erotic experience of you.
nanveṣa kasmādṛṣṭāntaḥ kimetenāśubhaṃ kṛtam | citspandaḥ sarvago bhinnādupādheḥ sa tathā tathā |	Now, what is the relevance of this elucidation in this context ? In response to this doubt, may be asked about the impropriety itself.
bhavetko'pi tirobhūtaḥ punarunmukhito'pi san | vināpi daiśikātprāgvatsvayameva vimucyate |	Irrespective of having been set apart from the teacher, the disciple can attain the state of liberation through his self-effort provided he is intensively inclined towards it.
prakārastveṣa nātroktaḥ śaktipātabalādgataḥ | asaṃbhāvyatayā cātra dṛḍhakopaprasādavat | | ityeṣa yo guroḥ prokto vidhistaṃ pālayedguruḥ | anyathā na śivaḥ yāyācchrīmatsāre ca varṇitam |	All this deliberation on this point is not meant to suggest the irrelevance of the teacher in the attainment of liberation but to emphasise the point of importance of descent of the grace lacking in which it is rather impossible to attain that state like the safety of the person who has become the target of his master's anger without anyone powerful enough to intervene between the two.
anyāyaṃ ye prakurvanti śāstrārthaṃ varjayantyalam | te'rdhanārīśapuragā guravaḥ samayacyutāḥ |	Those teachers who do injustice to the śāstra by deviating from their instructions, they are considered as fallen from the right path and have to dwell in the state of being known as Ardhanāriśapura.
anyatrāpyadhikāraṃ ca neyādvidyeśatāṃ vrajet | anyatra samayatyāgātkravyādatvaṃ śataṃ samāḥ |	Elsewhere also it has been observed that if one were not to follow the code of conduct of the system concerned, he is liable to remain at the state of Vidyesa. Rite of Sacred Bath At another place in the śāstra has also been stated that deviation from the prescribed code of conduct may result in the fall of the defaulter to the state of flesh-eater for one hundred years.
iyattatratyatātparyaṃ siddhāntagururunnayaḥ | bhavetpiśācavidyeśa śuddha eva tu tāntrikaḥ | ṣaḍardhadaiśikaścārdhanārīśabhuvanasthitiḥ | eṣā karmapradhānānāṃ gurūṇāṃ gatirucyate |	The words here and there iyat and tatratya in the foregoing verse refer to teachers of the Trika, Siddhānta and Tantra systems who on account of deviating from the norms of their Schools are said to remain restricted to the state of the Vidyeśa, Ardhanārīśapura and piśāca respectively. -a These are the destinations of those teachers who profess for the state of enjoyment.

This has been stated everywhere. b-a All these details are communicated to the disciple on the occasion of the ceremonial bath also.
adhikārārpaṇaṃ nātra naca vidyāvrataṃ kila | sādhyamantrārpaṇaṃ tvatra svopayogikriyākrame |	There is no necessity of mentioning the submission of the responsibilities of the teacher to the disciple nor for the vow of wisdom to be observed by the latter here.

So far as that of the followers of such a higher kind of system of deliverance as the Trika is concerned, it needs to be performed by the knowledgeable teacher, of those who might have transgressed its code of conduct.
samayācāradoṣeṣu pramādātskhalitasya hi | antyeṣṭidīkṣā kāryeti śrīdīkṣottaraśāsane |	- It has been observed in the Dikşottara śāstra that the post-mortem initiation of those is necessary who might have committed the fault of transgressing the code of the system due to negligence or inadvertence.
yatkiṃcitkathitaṃ pūrvaṃ mṛtoddhārābhidhe vidhau | pratimāyāṃ tadevātra sarvaṃ śavatanau caret | śrīsiddhātantrakathito vidhireṣa nirūpyate | antimaṃ yadbhavetpūrvaṃ tatkṛtvāntimamādimam |	Whatever has been stated earlier in the context of the ceremony of elevation of the dead the same needs to be performed on the actual body of the dead in place of the symbolic. What has been stated already in this regard as per the Siddhā Tantra, the same is being elucidated here. -a Whatever be final as per that account, needs to be performed right in the beginning including the mantras and letters.
saṃhṛtyaikaikamiṣṭiryā sāntyeṣṭidvitayī matā | pūjādhyānajapāpluṣṭasamaye natu sādhake | piṇḍapātādayaṃ muktaṃ khecaro vā bhavetpriye | ācārye tattvasaṃpanne yatra tatra mṛte sati |	This ceremony should be performed for the sake of those who might have died of some trouble in course of worship, meditation and muttering of mantras and not for those who be engaged in inner search sādhanā as he is destined to attain liberation or at least the status of moving in the space of consciousness. b-a There is no necessity of performance of this ceremony on the death of that teacher, no matter wheresoever meeting death, who might have got rid of his sense of ego by virtue of having realised consciousness as the essence of the reality.
antyeṣṭinaiva vidyeta śuddhacetasyamūrdhani | mantrayogādibhirye ca māritā narake tu te | kāryā teṣāmihāntyeṣṭirguruṇātikṛpālunā | na maṇḍalādikaṃ tvatra bhavecchmāśānike vidhau |	b-a Deliberation on Post-Mortem Initiation Those who might have got killed in course of their engagement in misapplication of mantra and kindred rites, and be destined to move to hell, performance of this ceremony by a merciful teacher for the sake of elevation of their spirits is necessary. In course of the burning of their dead bodies, there is no necessity of drawing circles, etc.
kecittadapi kartavyamūcire pretasadmani | pūjayitvā vibhuṃ sarvaṃ nyāsaṃ pūrvavadācaret |	b- Some authorities are of the view that drawing of circle is necessary on the cremation ground also and thus having worshipped the Lord, all other rites need to be performed here also.

tadarthametaduditaṃ natu mokṣopayogyadaḥ | ityūce parameśa śrīkulagahvaraśāsane |	- Indeed, it is for creating such confidence in the mind of the unfaithful that this device is applied to the body of the dead, though it may not necessarily be a symptom of redemption, according to the Kulagahvara Sāstra.
sādhyo'numeyo mokṣādiḥ pratyayairyadatīndriyaḥ | dīkṣottare ca puryaṣṭavargārpaṇamihoditam |	Quiver in the body of the dead is really used following the ceremony of initiation as the faith-creating device in the efficacy of the teacher and his mantra to redeem the soul of the dead from the hold of the eightfold psycho-physical principles of the five elements to be captured by the five senses, mind, ego and intellect.
tadvidhiḥ śrutipatre'bje madhye devaṃ sadāśivam | īśarudraharibrahmacatuṣkaṃ prāgdiāditaḥ | pūjayitvā śrutisparśo rasaṃ gandhaṃ vapurdvayam | dhyahaṃkṛtī manaśceti brahmādiṣvarpayetkramāt | eteṣāṃ tarpaṇaṃ kṛtvā śatahomena daiśikaḥ | eṣā sāṃnyāsikī dīkṣā puryaṣṭakaviśodhanī |	In fact, the secret behind this device is to worship Brahmā as the deity of the four- petalled mūlādhāra cakra Sruti-patra abja , Visnu as that of the svādhisthāna, Rudra as that of the manipura, Isa as that of the anāhata, Sadāśiva as that of visuddha, Siva as that of the ajñā besides those of other cakras representing manas, ahankāra and buddhi and offering to them the essences of their respective elements. - Deliberation on Post-Mortem Initiation Having offered the essences of these elements to their respective deities, the teacher should satiate them by offering one hundred oblations to the fire.
puryaṣṭakasyābhāve ca na svarganarakādayaḥ | tathā kṛtvā na kartavyaṃ laukika kiṃcanāpi hi |	Following dissolution of the eight-sheathed enclosure puryastaka, get eliminated the necessity of movement of the Self to any such state as the heaven and the hell.

gururannamayīṃ śaktiṃ vṛṃhikāṃ vīryarūpiṇīm | dhyātvā tathā samāviṣṭaṃ taṃ sādhyaṃ cintayetsudhīḥ | tato'sya yaḥ pāśavoṃ'śo bhogyarūpastamarpayet | bhoktaryekātmabhāvena śiṣya itthaṃ śivībhavet |	b- As done earlier, the teacher needs to mutter the mantra dedicated to Siva, offer oblations to fire followed by taking the object of offering in hands as symbolic of the food enforced by the force of Vrihikā, meditate on it under the supposition of its pervasion by the object aspired for. Then he should make an offer of its animality as the stuff of enjoyment to its enjoyer supposing his oneness with the disciple.
bhogyatānyā tanurdeha iti pāśatmakā matāḥ | śrāddhe mṛtoddhṛtāvantayāge teṣāṃ śivīkṛtiḥ |	- Aspiration for enjoyment is another body of the dead supposed to be fettered and is taken to have been transformed into Śiva via this post-mortem sacrifice meant for elevation of the soul of the dead.
ekenaiva vidhānena yadyapi syātkṛtārthatā | tathāpi tanmayībhāvasiddhyai sarva vidhiṃ caret |	Though the ceremony of initiation in itself is sufficient for the redemption of the disciple yet for the sake of his oneness with Siva these rites also need to be performed.
bubhukṣostu kriyābhyāsabhūmānau phalabhūmani | hetū tato mṛtoddhāra śrāddhādyasmai samācaret |	Plenty of action and practice in itself is sufficient for the profundity of result, even then for the sake of making it richer, the post-mortem rite for elevation of the soul of the dead needs to be performed.
teṣāṃ tu guru tadvargavargyasabrahmacāriṇām | tatsantānajuṣāmaikyadinaṃ parvadinaṃ bhavet |	Post-Mortem Rite According to Trika System Even then, the days of demise of such knowledgeable and wise persons are celebrated as the teacher's day by their family members, associates and disciples as promoters of their traditions.
yadāhi bodhasyodrekastadā parvāha pūraṇāt | janmaikyadivasau tena parvaṇī bodhasiddhitaḥ |	This is the way how their contributions to wisdom fulfil the necessity of promotion of it transforming the days of their death into sacred days, parva, meaning derivatively fulfilment on account of its derivation from the root pr, to fulfil.
putrako'pi yadā kasmaicana syādupakārakaḥ | tadā mātuḥ pituḥ śaktervāmadakṣāntarālagāḥ |	It is imperative for their son-like disciples, therefore, to interconnect the idā and pingalā nerves of their bodies and make the life- force flow via the susumnā taking them as mother and father offering them to the Divine on these days.
nāḍī pravāhayeddevāyārpayeta niveditam | śrīmadbharuṇatantre ca tacchivena nirūpitam |	This has been suggested by Siva Himself in Bharuna Tantra.

Irrespective of the performer’s relationship with the demised person concerned, while performing his post-mortem rite, he needs to satiate the teacher, the deity and the fire in coordination with the sādhanā of the cakras and on no account as per the fettered system of the Vedas.
śrīmaukuṭe tathā coktaṃ śivaśāstre sthito'pi yaḥ | pratyeti vaidike bhagnaghaṇṭāvanna sa kiñcana | tathoktadevapūjādicakrayāgāntakarmaṇā | rudratvametyasau janturbhogāndivyānsamaśnute | atha vacmaḥ sphuṭaṃ śrīmatsiddhaye nāḍicāraṇam | yā vāhayitumiṣyeta nāḍī tāmeva bhāvayet |	Sri Tantrāloka It has been stated in the Maukuta śāstra that he who even having joined Śaivism, behaves as per the Vedic system in regard to worship of deities, cakras and sacrifices, make his position get degraded as that of a broken bell attaining the state of Rudra and enjoying the heavenly luxuries available there. - As per the view of the Siddhayogiśvari Tantra, I am suggesting how to adjust the channel of the vital force on the nasal ground. Whichsoever channel of the breath be desired to become active at any moment, needs to be considered steadily to become active that way.
bhavanātanmayībhāve sā nāḍī vahati sphuṭam | yadvā vāhayituṃ yeṣṭā tadaṅgaṃ tena pāṇinā |	An alternative device for the change is to press the belly by that hand which way the breath may be desired to flow with the result that the same channel would become operative.

karotyuddharaṇaṃ tattannirvāṇāyāsya kalpate | uddharttā devadevo hi sa cācintyaprabhāvakaḥ |	In fact, it is Lord Siva Himself who is the real agent of this determination which is beyond the range of our imagination.
upāyaṃ gurudīkṣādidvāramātreṇa saṃśrayet | uktaṃ śrīmanmataṅgākhye munipraśnādanantaram | muktirvivekāttattvānāṃ dīkṣāto yogato yadi | caryāmātrātkathaṃ sā syādityataḥ samamuttaram |	As such, initiation by the teacher needs to be taken as just a way to it. b-a As stated in the Matanga Sāstra, in response to a query of sage Narada if liberation is possible through discrimination about the constituent elements of the Reality, initiation, and yogic realisation, what is the relevance of sticking to the code of conduct in this context ? In response to this question, the Lord smiled and wondered why the sage was confused on that point.
prahasyoce vibhuḥ kasmādbhrāntiste parameśituḥ | sarvānugrāhakatvaṃ hi saṃsiddhaṃ dṛśyatāṃ kila |	Mercifulness of the Lord is obvious to all who have the capacity to see things through.
prāptamṛtyorviṣavyādhiśastrādi kila kāraṇam | alpaṃ vā bahu vā tadvadanudhyā muktikāraṇam |	b- In fact, poison, disease, weapons, etc. are more or less causes of death, while the real cause of liberation is contemplative devotion to the Lord Himself. Initiation, etc.
muktyarthamupacaryante bāhyaliṅgāyamūni tu | iti jñātvā na sandeha itthaṃ kāryo vipaścitā |	are simply external devices applied for it only as secondary means to it; having listened to it, the wise needs to do accordingly to be sure of it.
itayaiva kathaṃ muktiriti bhakti parāṃ śrayet | uktaḥ śrāddhavidhirbhrāntigarātaṅkavimardanaḥ | |	- Sri Tantraloka Therefore, it is imperative for seekers of liberation to take up to the higher kind of devotion. This is the way to get rid of the danger of the poison of confusion underlying the rite of post-mortem performance known as śrāddha.
athocyate śeṣavṛttirjīvatāmupayoginī |	CHAPTER - as Duties and Conduct of an Aspirant Now is going to be explained the norm of the conduct of living aspirants which they have to abide by.
dīkṣā bahuprakāreyaṃ śrāddhāntā yā prakīrtitā | sā saṃskriyāyai mokṣāya bhogāyāpi dvayāya vā |	The initiation effective up to the end of the performance of the post-mortem ritual as deliberation on in the previous chapter is of several kinds. It is intended to cultivate the individual for the attainment of the state of enjoyment as well as liberation.
tatra saṃskārasiddhyai yā dīkṣāṃ sākṣānna mocanī | anusandhivaśādyā ca sākṣānmoktrī sabījikā |	The initiation accorded for the cultivation of impressions does not afford liberation directly while the seeded one proves to be liberatory but with the necessity of certain follow-up duties to be discharged.
tayobhayyā dīkṣitā ye teṣāmājīvavartanam | vaktaṃvyaṃ putrakādīnāṃ tanmayatvaprasiddhaye |	Both these kinds of Sri Tantrāloka initiation involve follow-up duties till the end of life and are meant for such disciples who have become son-like as a step close to attainment of oneness with Siva.
bubhukṣorvā mumukṣorvā svasaṃvidguruśāstrataḥ| pramāṇādyā saṃskriyāyai dīkṣā hi guruṇā kṛtā |	- Be he an aspirant of enjoyment or liberation, he has been initiated by the teacher for the sake of cultivating himself in keeping with the demands of his inner being, the teacher and the Sāstra as determinators of his worth for the goal he aspires for.
tataḥ sa saṃskṛtaṃ yogyaṃ jñātvātmānaṃ svaśāsane| taduktavastvanuṣṭhānaṃ bhuktyai muktyai ca sevate |	Thus, for the sake of considering himself as worthy of the objective as per the voice of his conscience as well as the norms established by his Sāstra, he needs to fulfil all the conditions that are prescribed for attainment of the states of enjoyment and liberation.
ācāryapratyayādeva yo'pi syādbhuktimuktibhāk | tatpratyūhodayadhvastyai brūyāttasyāpi vartanam | svasaṃvidgurusaṃvityostulyapratyayabhāgapi | śeṣavṛttyā samādeśyastadvighnādipraśāntaye |	The aspirant needs to fulfil all those obligations which his teacher asks him to perform which may be instrumental in removing the obstructions in his path of attainment of the states of enjoyment and liberation, since the teacher himself is the best judge in this respect. Along with the teacher, the conscience of the aspirant himself is equally significant in this matter as the decisive factor. Therefore, concurrence of both may serve as the best source of determination what remains necessary to fulfil for the sake of removing the obstructions, etc.

tatra nityo vidhiḥ sandhyānuṣṭhānaṃ devatāvraje | gurvagniśāstrasahite pūjā bhūtadayetyayam |	b- As regards the daily routine tasks, they include performance of worship in the morning and evening, devotion to the deity, worship of the teacher, fire and study of the Sāstras and kindness to living beings.
naimittikastu sarveṣāṃ parvaṇāṃ pūjanaṃ japaḥ | viśeṣavaśataḥ kiṃca pavitrakavidhikramaḥ |	As regards the incidental tasks, they include performance of worship on all sacred days, muttering of mantras and occasional purifying ceremonies.
ācāryasya ca dīkṣeyaṃ bahubhedā vivecitā | vyākhyādikaṃ ca tattasyādhikaṃ naimittikaṃ dhruvam |	Sri Tantrāloka Initiation offered by the teacher is said to be of several kinds. Expatiation, etc.
tatrādau śiśave brūyādgururnityavidhiṃ sphuṭam | tadyogyatāṃ samālokya vitatāvitatātmanām |	on it is certainly considered as an incidental task. The teacher needs to explain to the disciple initially the method of daily tasks clearly.
mukhyetarādimantrāṇāṃ vīryavyāptyādiyogyatām | dṛṣṭvā śiṣye tamevāsmai mūlamantraṃ samarpayet |	In view of his power of grasping ideas briefly as well as expansively he should offer to him the basic mantra besides the secondary ones along with their effect and range of applicability.
tacchāstradīkṣito hyeṣa niryantrācāraśaṅkitaḥ | na mukhye yogya ityanyasevātaḥ syāttu yogyatā |	- Even being initiated to the particular School if he were suspected to behave as independent of the norms of it, the main mantra should not be offered to him ending up only with the secondary one with the hope that through the application of it he may become worthy of the use of the other one also.
sādhakasya bubhukṣostu sādhakībhāvino'pivā| puṣpapātavaśātsiddho mantro'rpyaḥ sādhyasiddhaye | vitate guṇabhūte vā vidhau diṣṭe punarguruḥ | jñātvāsmai yogyatāṃ sāraṃ saṃkṣiptaṃ vidhimācaret |	The aptitude of receiving the main mantra, be he an aspirant of oneness with Siva, of enjoyment or desirous of starting the practice of sādhanā, may be examined through the method of throwing of spiritually enforced flowers on them. If the enforced flower is found effective, the mantra used in enforcing the flower should be offered to the particular candidate. Be it a case of offering the main or the secondary mantra to the disciple, the teacher needs to take an assessment of the qualification of the candidate before Duties and Conduct of an Aspirant revealing it to him followed by giving a brief of the performance associated with it.
tatraiṣa niyamo yadyanmāntraṃ rūpaṃ na tadguruḥ | likhitvā prathayecchiṣye viśeṣādūrdhvaśāsane |	Herein there is a directive for the teacher not to hand over the secret of the essence of the mantra in the written form to the disciple particularly if it relates to the systems of Trika and Kula.
mantrā varṇātmakāste ca parāmarśātmakā sa ca | gurusaṃvidabhinnaścetsaṃkrāmetsā tataḥ śiśau |	Mantras are of two kinds, lettered and communicated. That mantra alone deserves to be passed on to the disciple which might have been assimilated to the consciousness of the teacher.
lipisthitastu yo mantro nirvīryaḥ so'tra kalpitaḥ | saṃketabalato nāsya pustakātprathate mahaḥ |	The lettered mantra is considered by us as devoid of force. It remains only indicatory as read from the text as its effect is not likely to become forceful.
pustakādhītavidyāścetyuktaṃ siddhāmate tataḥ | ye tu pustakalabdhe'pi mantre vīrya prajānate | te bhairavīyasaṃskārāḥ proktāḥ sāṃsiddhikā iti | iti jñātvā guruḥ samyak paramānandaghūrṇitaḥ |	According to the Siddhā Tantra, those persons are considered as spiritually accomplished and imbued with the samskāra of Bhairava who are capable of realising the force of the mantra having received it even from the text. Having understood this, the teacher absorbed in the delight of the Supreme needs to deal with such gifted persons in keeping with their gifts of divine nature.
tādṛśe tādṛśe dhāmni pūjayitvā vidhiṃ caret | yathānyaśiṣyānuṣṭhānaṃ nānyaśiṣyeṇa budhyate |	- a Sri Tantrāloka The teacher needs to maintain secrecy so as to see that the practice of one disciple in regard to mantra may not be leaked out to the other, since leakage of the secrecy does affect the practice adversely.
tathā kuryādgururguptirhānirdoṣavatī yataḥ | devīnāṃ tritayaṃ śuddhaṃ yadvā yāmalayogataḥ |	Mantras addressed to the three goddesses namely, transcendent, transcendent-immanent and immanent to anyone of the three or only one of them in her conjugal form may be delivered to the disciple as purified by the teacher.
devīmekāmatho śuddhāṃ vadedvā yāmalātmikām | tatra mantraṃ sphuṭaṃ vaktrādguruṇopāṃśu coditam |	While offering the mantra to him, the teacher needs to keep the pitch of his voice so low that he may not be audible to any third person and yet each syllable of it be distinct.
avadhāryāpravṛttestamabhyasyenmanasā svayam tataḥ suśikṣitāṃ sthānadehāntaḥśodhanatrayīm | nyāsaṃ dhyānaṃ japaṃ mudrāṃ pūjāṃ kuryātprayatnataḥ | tatra prabhāte saṃbudhya sveṣṭāṃ prāgdevatāṃ smaret | kṛtāvaśyakakartavyaḥ śuddho bhūtvā tato gṛham | āśrityottaradigvaktraḥ sthānadehāntaratraye |	b- Right from the reception up to its application the disciple needs to remain mindful of purity on all these three levels that is the place of practice, body and inner being and then should conduct the assignment, meditation, muttering, poses and worship attentively. -a Duties and Conduct of an Aspirant Getting awakened in the early morning, having cleansed himself, he should first of all remember his favourite deity followed by coming home, facing north, cleansing the spot, the body and the inner being, assigning the mantras to their respective points, practising pose, meditating on the Divine with the sense of difference and non-difference both on the levels of body, life-force, intellect, space and earth.
dehāsudhīvyomabhūṣu manasā tatra cārcanam | japaṃ cātra yathāśakti devāyaitannivedanam | tanmayībhāvasiddhyarthaṃ pratisandhyaṃ samācaret |	Then he should do mental worship, muttering of the mantra submitting all to the Lord. For the sake of reaching the state of his oneness with the sense of the mantra, he needs to perform all this regularly both in the morning and evening.
anye tu prāgudakpaścāddaśadikṣu catuṣṭayīm |	b-a Followers of some other Schools hold that the sandhyā worship should be performed on four meeting points of the day and night including the meridian in all the ten directions.
sandhyānāmāhuretacca tāntrikīyaṃ na no matam | yāsau kālādhikāre prāk sandhyā proktā catuṣṭayī |	This, however, is the viewpoint of systems other than the Tantra. b-a What has been stated earlier in the chapter on time in its fourfoldness, the same may be performed by way of worship combined into one.
tāmevāntaḥ samādhāya sāndhyaṃ vidhimupācaret | sandhyācatuṣṭayīkṛtyamekasyāmathavā śiśuḥ | kuryātsvādhyāyavijñānagurukṛtyāditatparaḥ | sandhyādhyānoditānantatanmayībhāvayuktitaḥ | tatsaṃskāravaśātsarva kālaṃ syāttanmayo hyasau | tato yatheṣṭakāle'sau pūjāṃ puṣpāsavādibhiḥ |	As such, the disciple may be asked to perform the entire course of devotion together just once since besides it he has to attend to so many other obligations such as study, understanding of the science of it and service to the teacher. b-a By virtue of meditation performed only once on the meeting point of day and night, and getting identified with time itself in its entire span at the moment, may continue to remain so all the time on account of the impression of the same having settled in his mind. b-a Sri Tantrāloka Therefore, the young disciple needs to perform the worship of the ground, etc.
sthaṇḍilādau śiśuḥ kuryādvibhavādyanurūpataḥ | suśuddhaḥ sanvidhiṃ sarvaṃ kṛtvāntarajapāntakam arghapātraṃ purā yadvadvidhāya sveṣṭamantrataḥ | tena sthaṇḍilapuṣpādi sarvaṃ saṃprokṣayedbudhaḥ |	by means of flower, wine and other necessary objects in keeping with his capacity to afford. b-a Having purified himself fully, he should perform all the rituals ending with mute muttering followed by keeping ready the vessel of worship by the use of the mantra addressed to his favourite deity. In this process, what that wise student needs to do is the sprinkling of water on the ground, flowers, etc.
tatastatraiva saṃkalpya dvārāsanagurukramam | pūjayecchivatāviṣṭaḥ svadehārcāpuraḥsaram | tatastatsthaṇḍilaṃ vīdhravyomasphaṭikanirmalam | bodhātkaṃ samālokya tatra svaṃ devatāgaṇam |	b- Having conceived of the presence of the door to enter into and the seat for seating the teacher and the deities, he should offer worship to them along with the same accorded to his body also taking himself as possessed by Śiva. Having already cleansed the floor as transparent as the sky or the crystal, he should see the whole floor as embellished with the presence of the entire galaxy of gods.
pratibimbatayā paśyed bimbatvena ca bodhataḥ | etadāvāhanaṃ mukhyaṃ vyajanānmarutāmiva |	Visualisation of the presence of them there both by way of reflection and awareness is the real invocation of them just as it happens in the case of invocation of the deity of air through use of a fan.
sarvago'pi marudyadvadvyajanenopajīvitaḥ | arthakṛtsarvagaṃ mantracakraṃ rūḍhestathā bhavet | | catuṣkapañcāśikayā tadetattattvamucyate | śrīnirmaryādaśāstre ca tadetadvibhunoditam |	- Duties and Conduct of an Aspirant Just a the vibration of the omnipresent air by means of the fan amounts to invocation of it, even so the relevant circle of mantras would get actualised in its sense through this device. This point has been made out in the text known as Catuṣkapañcāśikā.
devaḥ sarvagato deva nirmaryādaḥ kathaṃ śivaḥ | āvāhyate kṣamyate vetyevaṃpṛṣṭo'bravīdvibhuḥ | |	The same point was stated by Lord Śiva Himself in Nirmaryāda Sastra. Lord Śiva is omnipresent and infinite. Even then, in the process of worship He is invoked and begged for his pardon.
vāsanāvāhyate devi vāsanā ca visṛjyate | paramārthena devasya nāvāhanavisarjane |	Having been enquired on this contrariety of reality and practice by the Goddess, He observed that it is only for the sake of satisfaction of the invoker that He happens to be invoked and sent off.
āvāhito mayā devaḥ sthaṇḍile ca pratiṣṭhitaḥ | pūjitaḥ stuta ityevaṃ hṛṣṭvā devaṃ visarjayet |	- It is for the sake of self-satisfaction of the devotee in the understanding that “the Lord was invoked by me, came and took His seat in the place of worship, became worshipped and prayed to be followed by sending Him off by me.” All this is meant for self-satisfaction of those who are ignorant.
kālena tu vijānanti pravṛttāḥ patiśāsane | anukrameṇa devasya prāptiṃ bhuvanapūrvikām | |	- Having come to the discipline of the Lord, such people in course of time happen to understand the secret of space and time in this respect how these are sheer projections of the Self.
jñānadīpadyutidhvastasamastājñānasañcayāḥ | kuto vānīyate devaḥ kutra vā nīyate'pi saḥ | |	For them whose whole mass of ignorance as darkness has been dispelled by means of the flame of the lamp of knowledge, there is no place wherefrom to invoke the Lord and send Him off as He is present everywhere in all forms including the subtle and the concrete.
sthūlasūkṣmādibhedena sa hi sarvatra saṃsthitaḥ | āvāhite mantragaṇe puṣpāsavanivedanaiḥ | dhūpaiśca tarpaṇaṃ kārya śraddhābhaktibalocitaiḥ | dīptānāṃ śaktinādādimantrāṇāmāsavaiḥ palaiḥ |	-a Having invoked Him along with the deities of the mantras, welcomed Him by means of flowers, wine, incense, He needs to be satiated with due force of faith, devotion, recitation of mantras as also meat, liquor and blood, etc. in all details.
raktaiḥ prāk tarpaṇaṃ paścāt puṣpadhūpādivistaraiḥ | āgatasya tu mantrasya na kuryāttarpaṇaṃ yadi | |	b-a In this context, if satiation of the deity of the invoked mantra were also not to have been done, he may take away half of the body of the devotee.
haratyardhaśarīraṃ sa ityuktaṃ kila śambhunā | yadyadevāsya manasi vikāsitvaṃ prayacchati |	b-a Whatever material brings expansion to the mind of the worshipper, the same needs to be offered to the deity by way of its worship, this is the view of honourable Sambhunātha.
tenaiva kuryātpūjāṃ sa iti śambhorviniścayaḥ| sādhakānāṃ bubhukṣūṇāṃ vidhirniyatiyantritaḥ |	The worshippers being in the process of their spiritual exercise as also aspiration for enjoyment, prescriptions of the teacher and the śāstra are to be followed strictly while aspirants of liberation and knowers of the Reality are free to choose whatever they like.
mumukṣūṇāṃ tattvavidāṃ sa eva tu nirargalaḥ | kārye viśeṣamādhitsurviśiṣṭaṃ kāraṇaṃ spṛśet |	b-a He who wishes to bring a certain specification to the effect, should go for its specific causal material, one wanting to produce red cotton in his farm, should go for such seed.
raktakarpāsatūlecchustulyatadbījapuñjavat | santi bhoge viśeṣāśca vicitrā kāraṇeritā | deśakālānusandhānaguṇadravyakriyādibhiḥ | svalpā kriyā bhūyasī vā hṛdayāhlādadāyibhiḥ |	There is enormous peculiarity in objects of enjoyment depending on the choice of the availability of their resources. b- Peculiarities of enjoyment are dependent on such factors as keeping in accord with the consideration of time, place, quality, material, action, and quantity which may prove exhilarating to the heart as also whether the causes are external or internal being born of the determination of the agent of enjoyment.
bāhyaiḥ saṅkalpajairvāpi kārakaiḥ parikalpitā | mumukṣorna viśeṣāya nai śreyasavidhiṃ prati |	So far as the objective of attainment of liberation is concerned, these factors of specification have no role to play in it.
nahi bahmaṇi śaṃsanti bāhulyālpatvadurdaśāḥ | citaḥ svātantryasāratvāt tasyānandaghanatvataḥ |	- In case of the objective being attainment of Brahman, there is no place for any kind of discretion of difference in quantity in view of the autonomous nature of consciousness and hence its being pure stuff of delight.
kriyā syāttanmayībhūtyai hṛdayāhlādadāyibhiḥ|	As regards the factor of action, its involvement in it is required for becoming one with the Ultimate which in any case is exhilarating to the inmost being of the aspirant.

iti ślokatrayopāttamarthamantarvibhāvayan | yena kenāpi bhāvena tarpayeddevatāgaṇam |	The galaxy of gods should be satiated by means of squeeze of the sense of these three verses purified through contemplation.
mudrāṃ pradarśayetpaścānmanasā vāpi yogataḥ | vacasā mantrayogena vapuṣā saṃniveśataḥ |	The offering of the squeeze is to be followed by display of postures mentally on the yogic pattern as also verbally through the use of mantras as well as bodily by assigning them to different significant points on it.
kṛtvā japaṃ tataḥ sarvaṃ devatāyai samarpayet | taccayoktaṃ kartṛtātattvānirūpaṇavidhau purā | |	Having muttered the mantra it needs to be submitted to the deity. This has already been stated in relevant chapters deliberating on the factor of action.

The sanctified food prasāda should be offered to the deity of the door, that of the seat to the group of teachers and the remainder of it should be taken by the disciple himself dropping the rest in any deep reservoir of water.
prāṇino jalajāḥ pūrvaṃ dīkṣitāḥ śambhunā svayam | vidhinā bhāvinā śrīmanmīnanāthāvatāriṇā |	Aquatic animals were initiated at the primeval stage by Lord Śiva Himself through His incarnation in the form of Minanātha.

atastattvavidādhvastaśaṅkātaṅko'pi paṇḍitaḥ | prakaṭaṃ nedṛśaṃ kuryāllokānugrahavāñchayā |	Therefore, the wise man who has transcended all fear of any such danger in his life should also not transgress this code of conduct out of his compassion towards people at large.

In case of happening to have taken Duties and Conduct of an Aspirant inadvertently food defiled by any such creature he should take bath, worship the Divine by means of flowers and throw them in some deep reservoir of water.
puṣpāṇi sarvaṃ tatsthaṃ tadgādhāmbhasi nikṣipet | ukta sthaṇḍilayāgo'yaṃ nityakarmaṇi śambhunā | athocyate liṅgapūjā sūcitā mālinīmate |	- CHAPTER - C Mode of Worship of the Emblem Linga-Pūja Now is going to be discussed the procedure of worship of the emblem in keeping with reference to it in the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra.
eteṣāmardhvaśāstroktamantrāṇāṃ na pratiṣṭhitam | bahiṣkuryāttato hyete rahasyatvena siddhidāḥ |	The crux of ideas underlying these mantras of the higher kind of Sāstra should not be exposed as it offers siddhi only when remains kept secret. Exposure of the secret of the source of siddhi through entry into the channel of its magnanimous force of delight renders it ineffective.
śāntatvanyakkriyodbhūtajighatsāvṛṃhitaṃ vapuḥ| svayaṃ pratiṣṭhataṃ yena so'syābhoge vinaśyati | uktaṃ jñānottarāyāṃ ca tadetatparameśinā | śivo yāgapriyo yasmādviśeṣānmātṛmadhyagaḥ |	Śiva is characterised as pervasive of everything as its enjoyer. Dissociation of Him from this characteristic role makes Him obstructive Siva pervades everything by virtue of ascendance of His potentiality of action over and above peacefulness on account of His will to enjoy which if exposed makes Him disappear from it. It has been stated in the Jñānottarā by the Lord Himself that Siva likes sacrifice.
tasmādrahasyaśāstreṣu ye mantrāstānbudho bahiḥ | na pratiṣṭhāpayejjātu viśeṣādvyaktarūpiṇaḥ |	This is why He pervades the sounds of the alphabet at the top of them. In view of this liking of Him, wise men should not expose mantras of secret Sāstras particularly in tangible form.
ata eva mṛtasyārthe pratiṣṭhānyatra yoditā | sātra śāstreṣu no kāryā kāryā sādhāraṇī punaḥ |	- This is why there is an observation of another śāstra that the representative symbol of the dead should be established anywhere else apart from the cremation ground and should not be applied to the Trika system, and if wished to be established at all, it should be just temporary.
ā tanmayatvasaṃsiddherā cābhīṣṭaphalodayāt | putraka sādhako vyaktamavyaktaṃ vā samāśrayet | putrakairgururabhyarthyaḥ sādhakastu svayaṃ vidan | yadi tatsthāpayenno cettenāpyarthyo gururbhavet |	Until the son-like disciple or any other aspirant practising yoga under the guidance of a particular teacher attains oneness with Siva as his ultimate objective, he is free to take resort to his favourite icon which may be tangible or intangible. Mode of Worship of the Emblem Linga-Pūjā Whether any emblem of Śiva needs to be established or not, in this regard the teacher should be enquired by the son-like disciples while the independent aspirant needs to decide it himself or he, too, should ask the teacher about it.
guruścātra nirodhākhye kāla itthaṃ vibhau vadet | jīvatyasminphalāntaṃ tvaṃ tiṣṭherjīvāvadhīti vā |	During his stay with the disciple, the teacher needs to talk to Śiva praying to Him to remain there on that spot until he attains oneness with Him or at least remains alive.
liṅgaṃ ca bāṇaliṅga vā ratnajaṃ vātha mauktikam | pauṣpamānnamatho vāstraṃ gandhadravyakṛtaṃ ca vā |	The emblem should be bāna-linga found in the bed of river Narmadā, or made of gems, pearls, heap of flowers, food, cloth or anything fragrant.
natu pāṣāṇajaṃliṅga śilpyutthaṃ parikalpayet | dhātūtthaṃ ca suvarṇotthavarjamanyadvivarjayet |	Any emblem manufactured out of stone by any manufacturer is not admissible. As regards the metallic, only gold and none else is admissible.
na cātra liṅgamānādi kvacidapyupayujyate | udāravīryairmantrairyadbhāsitaṃ phaladaṃ hi tat |	- In this context there is no relevance of any measurement of the size of the emblem, etc. What is important is the enforcement of it by mantras of higher value which may make it yield the result aspired for.
tasyāpi sthaṇḍilādyuktavidhinā śuddhimācaret | mantrārpaṇaṃ tathaiva syānnirodhastūktayuktitaḥ |	While establishing the emblem, purification of the spot is necessary as per the prescribed way. So is the case with the enforcement of it by means of mantra with the sense of stability.
agnau ca tarpaṇaṃ bhūriviśeṣāddakṣiṇā guroḥ | dīnāditṛptirvibhavādyāga ityadhiko vidhiḥ |	The other necessities are satiation of fire, ceremonial gift to the teacher in due quantity, donation to destitutes and oblation to fire in keeping with the capacity of the candidate.
sarveṣvavyaktaliṅgeṣu pradhānaṃ syādakalpitam | tathā ca tatra tatroktaṃ lakṣaṇe pārameśvare |	As regards the case of unmanifest emblems, the most important amongst them would be that which is not artificial. In the scripture this characteristic of it has been determined at various places.
sūtre pātre dhvaje vastre svayambhūbāṇapūjite | nadīprastravaṇotthe na nāhvānaṃ nāpi kalpanā | pīṭhaprasādamantrāṃśavelādiniyamo naca | vyaktaṃ vā citrapustādau devadārusuvarṇajam |	There is neither any provision for invocation nor for imagination in Sāstras in such emblems as thread, vessel, banner, cloth, self-made bāna-linga and that which is available in the bed of any river. So is the case with seat, sacred food, part of mantra, time, picture, book, image carved on wood of the divine tree, devadāru Cedrus deodara or made of gold.
atha dīkṣitasacchilpikṛtaṃ sthāpayate guruḥ | athavā lakṣaṇopetamūrdhatatkarparāśritam |	- The teacher may establish as an emblem of Śiva that artefact which may be manufactured by such an artist who may be truthful and initiated under Saivism or that artistic creation which may be displaying the image of the skull as a whole or any part of it.
paṅkticakrakaśūlābjavidhinā tūramāśrayet | tallakṣaṇaṃ bruve śrīmatpicuśāstre nirūpitam |	Mode of Worship of the Emblem Linga-Pūjā Any golden article drawn with a linear, circular, trident-like or lotus-like figure may be admissible as an emblem of Śiva. I am going to talk about its characteristic feature as per the Picu Sāstra.
tūre yoga sadā śastaḥ siddhido doṣavarjite | jālakairjarjarai randhrardantairūnādhikai rujā |	Practice of yoga on any golden artefact shorn of defect is recommended as it is supposed to be fruitful. -a Defects of such an artefact may be setting of cobweb on it, having become an antique or with some hole in it, uneven surface, association with disease.
yukte ca tūre hāni syāt taddhīne yāga uktamaḥ| kāmya eva bhavettūramiti kecitprapedire |	If anyone of these defects is associated with the artefact, it may prove injurious and if not so, it would form an excellent emblem. Some authorities have said that any golden artefact is supposed to be desirable.
guravastu vidhau kāmye yatnāddoṣāṃstyajediti | vyācakṣate picuproktaṃ na nitye karmaṇītyadaḥ |	b- My teachers have said that care needs to be taken to see that the artefact is free of defect. Picu Sāstra has said that such is not necessary in regard to the use of it in daily ceremonials.
śrīsiddhāntatra uktaṃ ca tūralakṣaṇamuttamam | ekādikacatuṣkhaṇḍe gomukhe pūrṇacandra ke | padmagorocanāmuktānīrasphaṭikasaṃnibhe | ekādipañcasadrandhravidyārekhānvite śubhe |	As per the Siddhā Tantra, the artefact may be entirely one, divided into two, three or even four, similar to the face of a cow, of the shape of the full moon or lotus and in any case as clean and charming as gorocana, pearl, water, or crystal. Sri Tantrāloka There should be provision in it of holes numbering one, two, three, four and five as also of lines indicatory of fourteen disciplines of knowledge.
na rūkṣavakraśakaladīrghanimnasabinduke| ślakṣṇayā vajrasūcyātra sphūṭaṃ devīgaṇānvitam |	It should not be rough in its appearance, distorted in shape, divided, disproportionately lengthy, deep and disfigured with points. It should be smooth and adorned with figures of goddess drawn with a diamond needle.
sarva samālikhetpūjyaṃ sarvāvayavasundaram | etadevānusartavyamarghapātre'pi lakṣaṇam |	Lastly, it should look beautiful in all respects. The same specifications are necessary for the vessel of worship arghapātra also.

The main part of the sacrifice needs to be performed well within this period irrespective of the intention behind it be that of peace or violence as per the advise of the director of the performance. b-a Some authorities are of the view that on the lapse of the definite duration of time ascertained for a particular sacrificial performance some other suitable date should be chosen for the completion of the sacrificial rite concerned in view of the union of the asterisks favourable to it.
tamanādṛtya viśeṣaṃ pradhānayetsāmayamiti kecit | neti tvasmadguravo viśeṣarūpā hi tithiriha na velā |	Our teachers, however, do not agree with this viewpoint. As per their view, it is the particular date which is more important than a particular section of it.
saṃvedyarūpaśaśadharabhāgaḥ saṃvedakārkaranikaraiḥ | yāvānyāvati pūrṇaḥ sā hi tithirbhagrahaiḥ sphuṭībhavati |	Out of the two determinants of date and time, while the sun is primary, the moon is secondary on account of the former representing the indicator and the latter the object of indication.
tasmānmukhyātra tithi sā ca viśeṣyā graharkṣayogena| velātra na pradhānaṃ yuktaṃ caitattathāhi parameśaḥ | | śrītrika bhairavakulaśāstreṣūce na parvadivaseṣu | velāyogaṃ kaṃcana tithibhagrahayogato hyanyam |	Thus, Tantrāloka the former comprehends all as a whole while the latter makes explicit with the help of the planets. b- Thus date becomes the main part of time while planets and asterisks are just attributes to it adding certain specifications to it. So has observed the Lord as is borne out by Trika, Bhairava and Kula Sāstras. A particular occasion in this ambit of date and duration of the meeting of asterisks is of least significance.
bhagrahayogābhāve tithistu pūjyā pradhānarūpatvāt| śvetābhāve kṛṣṇacchāgālambhaṃ hi kathayanti | yatpunarūrmiprabhṛtini śāstre veloditāpi tatkāmyam | mukhyatayoddiśya vidhiṃ tathāca tatra pauṣaparvadine |	In the case of unavailability of the meeting point of planets and asterisks, it is the prescribed date which needs to be accepted as the day of worship on account of it being the main factor in course of the passage of time. This decision finds an apt support in a śāstra ie Mimāmsā, though other than the śaiva in its prescription of sacrificing a black goat in case of unavailability of a white one. If the śāstras like Urmi and Kula, etc.
kṛtvārcanamardhaniśi dhyātvā japtvā bahirgatasya yathā| ādeśaḥ phalati tathā māghe cakrādvacaḥ phalati |	For instance, worship, meditation, muttering of mantras on the festive date of the midnight of the month of Pusa even outside the circle yields the same result as is available through the performance of the same acts from within the circle in the month of Māgha.
acirādabhīṣṭasiddhiḥ pañcasu maitrī dhanaṃ ca melāpaḥ| cakrasthāne krodhāt pāṣāṇasphoṭanena ripunāśaḥ |	While the desired objective of friendship, wealth and association is achieved soon through worship from within the circle during the months of Phālguna, Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyestha and āsādha, one can overpower one's enemies by breaking stone angrily within the circle in the month of Srāvaņa, Bhadrapada, Asvina, Kārttika and Agrahāyana.
siddhādeśaprāptirmārgāntaṃ kathyate vibhunā | bhagrahayogābhāve velāṃ tu titheravaśyamīkṣeta |	Lord Śiva has said that by moving all alone during the midnight the aspirant attains instructions of some accomplished siddha unseen agency.
bhagrahatithivelāṃśānuyāyi sarvāṅgasundaraṃ tu dinam | yadi labhyeta tadāsminviśeṣatamapūjanaṃ racayet | naca kāmyameva kevalametatparivarjane yataḥ kathitaḥ | |	b-a If one were to get to accomplish something on a day which is favourable from the viewpoints of the asterisks as well as the occasion besides that of the date itself, one should welcome it as the best for his undertaking. b-a Whatever has been stated above in regard to the negativity of time is applicable not only to action for desired effect.
samayavilopaḥ śrīmabhairavakula ūrmiśāstre ca | duṣṭā hi durācārā paśutulyā parva ye na viduḥ |	According to the Bhairavakula and Urmikula, this is significant also for avoiding wastage of the proper occasion for action. Those doers are stupid, wicked and animal-like in their actions who do not understand the significance of the occasion of action.
naca kāmyasyākaraṇe syājjātu pratyavāyitvam| tatrānuyāgasiddhayarthaṃ cakrayāgo nirūpyate |	b- Tantrāloka Non-performance of any ritual of desired result may not be any cognisable obstruction. What is significant in this context is the performance of the main part of the sacrifice within the ambit of the circle.
mūrtiyāga iti prokto yaḥ śrīyogīśvarīmate | nityaṃ naimittikaṃ karma yadatroktaṃ maheśinā | |	What is characterised as mūrti-yāga in the Siddhayogiśvari Tantra may be regular as well as incidental as has been stated by Mahesa.
sarvatra cakrayāgo'tra mukhyaḥ kāmye viśeṣataḥ | jñānī yogī ca puruṣaḥ strī vāsminmūrtisaṃjñake | | yāge prayatnato yojyastaddhi pātramanuttaram | tatsaṃparkātpūrṇatā syāditi traiśirasādiṣu |	In this sacrifice, cakra-yāga is regarded as the main item particularly when it is meant for achieving the desired result. As performers of it are required to be knowledgeable of it as well as practitioners of yoga irrespective of being males or females since such an individual is the best performer of it. In view of the Diksottara Sāstra, his food is regarded as Brahmā, drink as Visnu and enjoyment as Siva and he himself as the uplifter even of those who lie in the lowest rung of the society.

pavitrakāṇāṃ saṃpādya kuryātsaṃpātasaṃskriyām | tataḥ saṃvatsaraṃ dhyāyebhairavaṃ chidrasākṣiṇam | |	This is to be followed by disposal of the remaining articles known as sampāta sanskriyā and meditation on Bhairava as the witness of flaws, whatever happening to have been committed inadvertently.
dattvā pūrṇāhutiṃ devi praṇamenmantrabhairavam | oṃ samastakriyādoṣapūraṇeśa vrataṃ prati | yatkiṃcidakṛtaṃ duṣṭaṃ kṛtaṃ vā mātṛnandana | tatsaṃrva mama deveśa tvatprasādātpraṇaśyatu | |	b- Having offered the final oblation, O Lady, the disciple should bow his head to Bhairava praying as follows: "Om, whatever flaws might have occurred in the observation of the ceremonials, O Lord, you need to correct it yourself and whatever might have left unaccomplished that, too, you need to understand as completed, by your grace.
sarvathā raśmicakreśa namastubhyaṃ prasīda me | anena dadyāddevāya nimantraṇapavitrakam |	O Lord of the cakras kindly be merciful on me.” With Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... this prayer, the disciple needs to offer the purificatory thread to Him as a token of invitation.

dantakāṣṭhaṃ mṛcca dhātrī samṛddhātrī sahāmbunā | catuḥ samaṃ ca taiḥ sārdhaṃ bhasma pañcasu yojayet |	and make use of the purifying materials including the dental stick, clay, paste of āmalaka, dhātri and water all four mixed together in equal quantity besides ash.
prāgdakṣapaścimordhvastha vāmavaktreṣu vai kramāt | pañcaitāni pavitrāṇi sthāpayecceśagocare |	- All these five purifying materials should be placed in the north-east meant for the north, east, south, west and upward directions.

tato'ñjalau pavitraṃ tu gṛhītvā prapaṭhedidam | akāmādathavā kāmādyanmayā na kṛtaṃ vibho | tadacchidraṃ mamāstvīśa pavitreṇa tavājñayā | mūlamantra pūrayeti kriyāniyamamityatha |	- Taking the purifier in the palms of both the hands folded together, the disciple needs to repeat the prayer to the Lord as follows: “O Lord, willingly or unwillingly, I might have committed certain faults, which, pray, may be set right through this article of purification by your permission.” The basic operative word of prayer in this mantra is pūraya, fulfil.
vauṣaḍantaṃ pavitraṃ ca dadyābindvavasānakam | nādāntaṃ samanāntaṃ cāpyunmanāntaṃ kramāttrayam |	- Ending the pronouncement of the mantra with word vausat the purfier needs to be handed over by going back to the root of sound and eventually to the root of operation of mind and even beyond one after the other in the same order ending up with access to the last point of articulation and ideation.
evaṃ catuṣṭayaṃ dadyādanulomena bhautikaḥ | naiṣṭhikastu vilomena pavitrakacatuṣṭayam |	The aspirant of enjoyment should drop the purifier favourably while that of liberation unfavourably to the inclination of the hair of his body. The number of purifiers required for this rite is four.
yatkiñcidvividhaṃ vasracchatrāṅakaraṇādikam | tannivedyaṃ dīpamālāḥ suvarṇatilabhājanam | vastrayugmayutaṃ sarvasampūraṇanimittataḥ | bhojanīyā pūjanīyāḥ śivabhaktāstu śaktitaḥ |	Clothes, umbrella, ornaments, gold, utensils filled with tila, etc. whatever be meant for distribution should be given to the people at this stage followed by celebration of the occasion by illumination of lamps. A pair of clothes to each one of the devotees of Siva in keeping with one's capacity should be given to them followed by feasting and homage.
catusridvyekamāsādidinaikāntaṃ mahotsavam | kuryāttato na vrajeyuranyasthānaṃ kadācana | | tatastu daiśikaḥ pūjyo gāmasmai kṣīriṇīṃ navām | dadyātsuvarṇaratnādirūpyavasravibhūṣitām |	- This festive occasion should be celebrated for four, three, two or one month or even for the same number of days, without leaving the place of celebration in the middle.

vadedguruśca saṃpūrṇo vidhistava bhavatviti | vaktavyaṃ devadevasya punarāgamanāya ca |	The teacher should bless the disciple on the completion of the entire process of initiation and pray to the Lord to come again on invitation.
tato visarjanaṃ kāryaṃ guptamābharaṇādikam | naivedyaṃ gururādāya yāgārthe tanniyojayet | caturṇāmapi sāmānyaṃ pavitrakamiti smṛtam | nāsmādvrataṃ paraṃ kiñcit kā vāsya stutirucyate |	Thus comes the time of dispersal. Whatever sacrificial gift openly or secretly the teacher might have got in the whole process is expected to invest it in the performance of sacrifices. Tantrāloka This act of the teacher is said to be purificatory of all his acts put in the process of initiation. Appreciation of this act of selflessness on his part is beyond words.
śeṣaṃ tvagādhe vāryoghe kṣipenna sthāpayetsthiram | atha naimittikavidhiryaḥ purāsūtrito mayā | |	Whatever gifts might have been left with him, he needs to drop them in some deep reservoir of water leaving nothing with him.
sa bhaṇyate tatra kāryā devasyārcā viśeṣataḥ | cakrayāgaśca kartavyaḥ pūrvoktavidhinā budhaiḥ |	-a Now I am proposing to talk about the mode of performance of incidental rite which was referred to earlier and is inclusive of the worship of the Lord particularly as related to the sacrifice concerned with the cakras.
tatra yadyannijābhīṣṭabhogamokṣopakārakam | pāramparyeṇa sākṣādvā bhaveccidacidātmakam | tatpūjyaṃ tadupāyāśca pūjyāstanmayatāptaye | tadupāyo'pi saṃpūjyo mūrtikālakriyādikaḥ | |	As per one's objective being either enjoyment or liberation indirectly or directly, it needs to be concerned with consciousness and the inconscient both as also whatever else needs to be worshipped in that regard and the means required for the worship for the sake of gaining oneness through that worship as also the mode of worshipping the means of it such as the emblem, the time and the acts, etc.
upeyasūtisāmarthyamupāyatvaṃ tadarcanāt | tadrūpatanmayībhāvādupeyaṃ śīghramāpnuyāt | |	b- As regards the relevance of worshipping the means to the end it lies in the potentiality of the means to evolve out of itself the end by virtue of which getting oneness with that means the aspirant may evolve the end within no time from within himself.
yathā yathā ca naikaṭyamupāyeṣu tathā tathā | avaśyaṃbhāvi kāryatvaṃ viśeṣāccārcanādike | |	Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... As the aspirant draws closer and closer to the means, higher and higher becomes the possibility of realising his end particularly in regard to worship, etc.
jñānasya kasyacitprāptirbhogamokṣopakāriṇaḥ | yadā tanmukhyamevoktaṃ naimittikadinaṃ budhaiḥ |	That day itself happens to have become an incidental object of worship in view of the wise on which the aspirant of enjoyment or liberation whichever comes to get an intimation of the sort of knowledge by pursuing whose line of action he can realise that end.
tadupāya śāstramatra vaktāpyaupayiko guruḥ | tadvidyo'pi gurubhrātā saṃvādājjñānadāyakaḥ |	By virtue of serving as the bearer of that knowledge, the Sāstra concerned becomes the object of worship, its exponent becomes the teacher of the source, its knower as the brother of the teacher on account of having participated in conversation with him on it.
guroḥ patnī tathā bhrātā putra ityādiko gaṇaḥ | na yonisaṃbandhavaśādvidyāsaṃbandhajastu saḥ | vīryāruṇaparīṇāmadehāhantāpratiṣṭhitāḥ | dehopakārasantānā jñāteye pariniṣṭhitāḥ | |	- The wife of the teacher, his brother, all of them and such other ones become worshipable for him not on account of their blood relationship with the teacher but on account of having the possibility of sharing in the knowledge with the teacher. As regards the blood relationship it is based on the formation of the body as a mixture of the semen of the father and the raja or aruna from the side of the mother.
tathāca smṛtiśāstreṣu santaterdāyahāritā | yuktaiva tāvānsa hyukto bhedādūrāntikatvataḥ |	Tantrāloka These two kinds of relationships are taken into account in the Smrti on the problem of descendance favouring whichsoever is relatively closer as the inheritor.
ye tu tyaktaśarīrāsthā bodhāhambhāvabhāginaḥ | bodhopakārasantānadvayātte bandhutājuṣaḥ |	Different from it is the case of those who have risen above the sense of the bodily relationship and take joy in the relationship of wisdom and knowledge and recognise the same as the basis of relationship.
ātmā vikararahitaḥ śāśvatatvādahetukaḥ | svātantryāt punarātmīyādayaṃ channa iva sthitaḥ | punaśca prakaṭībhūya bhairavībhāvabhājanam | tatrāsya prakaṭībhāve bhuktimuktyātmake bhṛśam | | ya upāyaḥ samucito jñānasantāna eṣa saḥ | kramasphuṭībhavattādṛksadṛśajñānadhārayā |	- However, if someone were able to see beyond this physical fact by virtue of descent of grace of the Lord on him how this body is formed as a result of mixture of so and so hormones and is destined to be reduced to ashes while the ātman as eternally enduring and absolutely autonomous in its decision to have kept itself concealed in it without any ulterior motive except for lying await for emerging out and attaining oneness with Bhairava, be it via the course of enjoyment or liberation, the proper means to attaining to this objective for him would certainly be cognisance of the tradition of wisdom and knowledge.
galadvijātīyatayā prāpyaṃ śīghraṃ hi labhyate | evaṃ cānādisaṃsārocitavijñānasantaḥ |	Getting manifested in him such a stream of knowledge and wisdom gradually this category of aspirant becomes rid of extraneous stuff from within him and attains his objective soon.
dhvaṃse lokottaraṃ jñānaṃ santānāntaratāṃ śrayet | asaṃsārocitodāratathāvijñānasantateḥ |	Thus, by virtue of having stopped the flow of the stream of awareness coming down from untold ages fascinating people in interests worldly, the aspirant needs to take recourse to the stream of heritage of knowledge and wisdom transcending mundane interests.
kāraṇaṃ mukhyamādyaṃ tadguruvijñānamātmagam | atyantaṃ svaviśeṣāṇāṃ tatrārpaṇavaśāt sphuṭam | upādānaṃ hi tadyuktaṃ dehabhede hi satyapi | dehasantatigau bhedābhedau vijñānasantateḥ |	b-a Knowledge and wisdom imparted by the teacher form the same stream of consciousness which having been made to flow within the aspirant draws all his attention to itself over and above everything worldly. b-a Obviously, on account of having surrendered one's specialities to that stream for ever, there may be the possibility of receiving the same through the other body assumed after demise of the present one.
na tathātvāya yogīcchāviṣṭaśāvaśarīravat | yoginaḥ paradehādijīvattāpādane nijam | dehamatyajato nānājñānopādānatā na kim | tena vijñānasantānaprādhānyādyaunasantateḥ | anyonyaṃ gurusantāno yaḥ śivajñānaniṣṭhitaḥ | itthaṃ sthite trayaṃ mukhyaṃ kāraṇaṃ sahakāri ca |	Continuity of attributes like difference and non-difference is relevant only on the level of the body and not in regard to Consciousness, as is elucidated by the case of the yogin's entry into the body of the disciple operating in its own way. b-a Is it not that while occupying the bodies of others without leaving their own, the yogins make use of bodily and mental faculties of their disciples in their own way elucidating how the body of Consciousness is more important than the physical one? b- Tantrāloka Thus, three factors are involved in the maintenance of the continuity of generation.
ekakāraṇakāryaṃ ca vastvityeṣa gurorgaṇaḥ | guru kāraṇamatroktaṃ tatpatnī sahakāriṇī |	Since the disciple and the teacher become one by virtue of both of them sharing in the same stream of consciousness as Siva in its purest form, the continuity of generation in its real form exists basically in the transmission of the same cognitive content between them as the cause and the effect.
yato niḥśaktikasyāsya na yāge'dhikṛtirbhavet	-a The teacher serves as the main cause in this causal chain whereas his wife as subsidiary to him as by virtue of serving as the source of his power he cannot perform the sacrifice without her.
antaḥ sthodārasaṃvittiśakterbāhyāṃ vināpi tām | sāmarthyaṃ yogino yadvadvināpi sahakāriṇam | ekajanyā bhrātaraḥ syustatsadṛgyastu ko'pi saḥ |	b-a On account of the potentiality lying within, with all its inclination, to sprout fully even in the absence of any external cause, as it happens in the case of yogins transmitting their force of consciousness to their disciple without any medium whatsoever, there is the possibility of the disciples, brothers on account of their common root with the teacher who may happen to help as the carrier of the wisdom to him in the capacity of the teacher.
punaḥ paramparāyogādguruvargo'pi bhaṇyate | mukhya eṣa tu santānaḥ mānyaśca sarvadāḥ |	By virtue of keeping the tradition alive via themselves they may again serve as teachers in their turn. This is the main feature of inheritance of the teacher ever respectable and honourable.
gurvādīnāṃ ca sambhūtau dīkṣāyāṃ prāyaṇe'pi ca | yadahastaddhi vijñānopāyadehādikāraṇam |	b- Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... Since the day of birth of the teacher and the day of his initiation as also those of the disciple himself come to serve as the medium of carrying forward the stream of Consciousness, they, too, are to be celebrated.
evaṃ svajanmadivaso vijñānopāya ucyate | tādṛgbhogāpavargādihetordehasya kāraṇam | |	This is why the disciple's own birthday happens to serve as a via media of the knowledge by virtue of forming the basis of the body as a means to attainment of both enjoyment and liberation.
dīkṣādikaśca saṃskāra svātmano yatra cāhni tat | bhavejjamadinaṃ mukhyaṃ jñānasantānajanmataḥ | svakaṃ mṛtidinaṃ yattu tadanyeṣāṃ bhaviṣyati | naimittikaṃ mṛto yasmācchivābhinnastadā bhavet |	The place and day of initiation, etc. of one's own by virtue of which he happened to become one with Śiva, are thus worthy of celebration in the chain of continuity of the tradition. It is in conformity with this tradition that one's own day of demise would become the day of celebration for others as it was on that day that he became one with Śiva. Tantrāloka Incidentally, we would like to talk about the nature of death itself.
vicitraphalakarmoghavaśāttattaccharīrabhāk | śarīrabhāktvaṃ caitāvadyattadgarbhasthadehagaḥ |	In spite of being all-pervading, Śiva assumes various forms of body on account of His will to contract Himself in keeping with the total result of His actions of various kinds.
saṃvitteḥ śūnyarūḍhāyāḥ prathamaḥ prāṇanodayaḥ| garbhasthadehanirmāṇe tasyaiveśvaratā punaḥ | |	-a His Lordship continues to rule the roost again in His expanded capacity in the state of lying in the womb and undergoing the process of formation of the body.
asaṅkocasya tanvādikartā teneśa ucyate | sa vāyvātmā dṛḍhe tasmindehayantre cidātmanā |	This is why He is known as Iśa, the Lord.
preryamāṇo vicarati bhastrāyantragavāyuvat ataḥ prāggāḍhasaṃsuptotthitavatsa prabuddhyate | |	b-a While lying tightly bound inside the frame of the body, being stimulated by His Self as consciousness he remains active like the air inside the blacksmith's bellows. This is why, having come out of the womb, he gets up like one getting awakened from deep slumber.
kramāddehenaṃ sākaṃ ca prāṇanā syādbalīyasī | tatrāpi karmaniyatibalātsā prāṇanākṣatām | gṛhṇāti śūnyasuṣirasaṃvitsparśādhikatvataḥ| evaṃ krameṇa saṃpuṣṭadehaprāṇabalo bhṛśam | |	Gradually along with the body, the process of breathing gains in strength and there, too, on account of the force of impressions of past actions and destiny his breathing becomes enduring going inside and coming outside through the void of the nose owing to its contact with consciousness. In this way gradually his body and breathing go on gaining sufficient strength by virtue of which he continues to suffer and enjoy the results of actions of his past lives done via different bodies born of wombs or otherwise.
bhogānkarmakṛtānbhuṅge yonyayonijadehagaḥ | uktaṃ ca gahvarābhikhye śāstre śītāṃśumaulinā |	This has been stated by Siva Himself in the Sāstra known as Gahvara.
yathā gṛhaṃ viniṣpādya gṛhī samadhitiṣṭhati | tathā dehī tanuṃ kṛtvā kriyādiguṇavarjitaḥ | |	As having completed the building of his house, the builder dwells therein even so the ātman, though shorn of all attributes including action, having formed the body dwells therein.
kiñcitsphuraṇamātra prāgniṣkala so'pi śabdhate | sphuṭendriyāditattvastu sakalātmeti bhaṇyate |	Though shorn of all differentiation previously he begins to express himself in explicit words having developed in him the organs concerned.
ityādi śrīgahvaroktaṃ tata eva paṭhebahu |	All these things have been stated in the Gahvara śāstra and therefore if anyone would like to know it in detail may read it therein.
kṣaye tu karmaṇāṃ teṣāṃ dehayantre'nyathāgate | prāṇayantraṃ vighaṭate dehaḥ syātkuḍyavattutaḥ | nāḍīcakreṣu saṅkocavikāsau viparītataḥ | bhaṅgaḥ śoṣaḥ klidirvātaśleṣmāgnyapacayoccayaiḥ | ityevamādi yātkiñcit prāksaṃsthānopamardakam |	-a On the exhaustion of the impressions of actions, the mechanism of the body becomes shattered, the system of breathing stops and the body turns into a demolished house. b-a There takes place a drastic change in the nervous system in the form of expansion wherever contracted and contraction wherever expanded, breakdown, drying up, getting wet, excess and scarcity in breathing, coughing, scarcity and excess of heat or fire in the body and thus total upsetting in the system of the functions.
| | dehayantre vighaṭanaṃ tadevoktaṃ manīṣibhiḥ | tasminvighaṭite yantre sā saṃvitprāṇanātmatām | gṛhṇāti yonije'nyatra vā dehe karmacitrite | sa dehaḥ pratibudhyeta prasuptotthitavattadā |	b-a Tantrāloka On the collapse of the present bodily system, the consciousness associated with it until now assumes the form of the life-force in another body born of the womb or otherwise as per the peculiarity of its previous actions and the person concerned gets awakened again as one getting up from slumber followed by the state of enjoyment and suffering ending up in another death as happened earlier.
tasyāpi bhogataddhānimṛtayaḥ prāgdeva hi | visṛṣṭisthitisaṃhārā ete karmabalādyataḥ |	b-a Creation, maintenance and death all these events take place in keeping with the law of action and result.
ato niyatikālādivaicitryānuvidhāyinaḥ | anugrahastu yaḥ so'yaṃ svasvarūpe vikasvare |	This is why they are made to follow the peculiarity of variations.
jñaptyātmeti kathaṃ karmaniyatyādi pratīkṣate | karmakālaniyatyādi yataḥ saṅkocajīvitam | saṅkocahānirūpe'sminkathaṃ heturanugrahe | anugrahaśca kramikastīvraśceti vibhidyate | |	b-a is the grace of the Supreme which becomes operative on the Self make it to fully bloom and realise its identity in the form of Siva over and above the law of action and predetermination. b-a The law of action, the control of time and determination niyati, law of causation are dependent on the contraction of the Self. As such, one cannot expect any grace from them.
prāk caiṣa vistarātprokta iti kiṃ punaruktibhiḥ | tena dīkṣāśivajñānadagdhasaṅkocabandhanaḥ |	Since these processes of its descent have already been elaborated on, there is no use of discussing it here again. b-a Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations...
dehānte śiva eveti nāsya dehāntarasthitiḥ| ye'pi tattvāvatīrṇānāṃ śaṃkarājñānuvartinām |	In view of those details, as a result of initiation and attainment of one's real oneness with Siva, when the limitations of contraction get burnt down, the aspirant following his demise becomes one with Siva instead of having to go to any other body.
martyo'vatīrya vā no vā śivaṃ yāntyapunarbhavāḥ | tatra svayambhuvo dvedhā ke'pyanugrahatatparāḥ | ke'pi svakṛtyāyātāṃśasthānamātropasevinaḥ| ye'nugrahārthamājñaptāsteṣu yo mriyate naraḥ |	b-a Tantrāloka Those such as Svayambhu, Muni and Devaṛṣi, having been born in the families of humans getting the privilege of initiation, descend down to the world of mortals or even without doing so reach the state of Śiva not to return at all, remain posted there in keeping with the quantum and quality of their actions, and having been permitted to shed their grace on their disciples as humans after their death or even without this exercise remain there itself.
yathā gaurī tapasyantī kaśmīreṣu guhāgatā | tatraiva vā yathā dhyānoḍḍāre naraharirvibhuḥ |	Such is the case of Gauri consort of Śiva practising tapas in Kaśmīra inside a particular cave. So is also the case of Lord Narahari dwelling on the bank of Vitastā.
vitastāṃ nayato daityāṃtrāsayandṛpta utthitaḥ | sāligrāme yathā viṣṇuḥ śivo vā svopabhoginaḥ | tapasyantau vadaryāṃ ca naranārāyaṇau tathā | ityevamādayo devāḥ svakṛtyāṃśasthitāstathā | ārādhitāḥ svocitaṃ tacchīghraṃ vidadhate phalam | svakṛtyāṃśasthiātānāṃ ca dhāmni ye'ntaṃ vrajanti te | |	So is also the case of Siva and Viṣṇu meditating as Nara and Nārāyana remaining meditating in the Badarikāśrama as also of some other gods present there close to them in their partial forms, on being meditated on provide the meditator with results in the form of enjoyment the beneficiaries of which having been born as humans and after initiation, attainment of wisdom, and action as per the same, reach the state of Śiva. Even stagnant bodies, animals and birds may avail of this opportunity following their demise in keeping with the quantum and quality of their actions in all their peculiarities.
tatra bhogāṃstathā bhuktvā martyeṣvavatarantyapi| martyāvatīrṇāste tattadaṃśakāstanmayāḥ punaḥ |	b-a Humans and animals also may reach the state kindred to them gradually however on account of pre-eminence of indiscrimination in them.
taddīkṣājñānacaryādikramādyānti śivātmatām | sthāvarādyāstiryagantāḥ paśavo'smindvaye mṛtāḥ |	While indiscrimination is obstruction in the path of the humans, inconscience is that in the way of the stagnant bodies. Stagnant bodies, etc.
svakarmasaṃskriyāvedhāttalloke citratājuṣaḥ | puṃsāṃ ca paśumātrāṇāṃ sālokyamavivekaḥ | avivekastadviśeṣānunmeṣānmauḍhyatastathā | sthāvarādyāstathābhāvamuttarottaratāṃ ca vā | |	This perspective of their elevation is implicit in traditional texts like Sarvajñāna, etc. where abodes of practitioners of tapas are described as densely strewn with birds like swans, kāraṇdavas Himalayan duck and covered by trees and creepers from habitations to habitations. b-a Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations...
ityetadāgameṣūktaṃ tata eva pure pure | kṣetramānaṃ bruve śrīmatsarvajñānādiṣūditam |	As per the measurement of the area of establishment of the emblem as mentioned in the texts like Sarvajñāna, etc., I am mentioning the following data.
liṅgāddhastaśataṃ kṣetramācāryasthāpite sati | svayambhūte sahastraṃ tu tadardhamṛṣiyojite |	If the emblem has been established by an ācārya, the area around it needs to be maintained as sacred up to the width of fifty metre. If it be self-emerged, the area should be five hundred metre while it should be two hundred and fifty metre if it happens to have been established by some seer.
tattvavitsthāpite liṅge svayambhūsadṛśaṃ phalam | atattvavidyadācāryo liṅga sthāpayate tadā |	The result of an emblem established by a knower of the Reality is the same as of one emerging by itself. If it becomes established by one who is ignorant of the Reality, the establishment would remain fraught with malice harmful to both the establisher and the owner of the ground as well as the emblem.
punarvidhirbhaveddoṣo hyanyathobhayadūṣakaḥ | ahamanyaḥ parātmānyaḥ śivo'nya iti cenmatiḥ |	b-a I am different, the Supreme Being is different and Śiva also is different.
na mocayenna muktaśca sarvamātmamayaṃ yataḥ | tasmāttattvavidā yadyatsthāpitaṃ liṅgamuttamam | | tadevāyatanatvena saṃśrayedbhuktimuktaye |	If this be the notion of the establisher, through the establishment of such an emblem, he would neither redeem anybody nor would get redeemed himself as all is pervaded by one and same Self. Therefore, it is imperative for establishing any emblem that the establisher should be a knower of the Reality as such as that emblem alone would be the best and would be suitable for taking resort to for the sake of attaining the states of enjoyment as well as liberation.
ukta śrīratnamālāyāṃ jñātvā kālamupasthitam | mokṣārthī na bhayaṃ gacchettyajeddehamaśaṅkitaḥ | tīrthāyatanapuṇyeṣu kālaṃ vā vañcayetpriye | ayogināmayaṃ panthā yogī yogena vañcayet | vañcane tvasamarthaḥ san kṣetramāyatanaṃ vrajet | |	b-a Tantrāloka It has been observed in the Ratnamālā that having understood the moment of death, the aspirant of liberation needs to move fearlessly to some sacred place deceiving the Time itself, O Dear! This is the way out recommended for those who are not accomplished yogins while the accomplished yogin is capable of deceiving it by means of his accomplishment in yoga itself. Being incapable of deceiving by himself, the aspirant needs to move to some sacred place by virtue of which he becomes sure to deceive it.
tīrthe samāśrayāttasya vañcanaṃ tu vijāyate | anena ca dharādyeṣu tattveṣvabhyāsayogataḥ |	As regards the case of the knowers of the Reality, that would be discussed in the sequel. b- So far has been recounted the destiny of those who are animal-like.
paśūnāmeṣa vṛttānto ye tu tattattvadīkṣitāḥ | te tadīśasamīpatvaṃ yānti svaucityayogataḥ |	Those who Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... are knowers of the Reality on the other hand, by virtue of having got initiated into it, reach the proximity of their Lord as per their worth for the state of being concerned.
yogyatāvaśasaṃjātā yasya yatraiva vāsanā | sa tatraiva niyoktavyaḥ pureśāccordhvaśuddhibhāk |	Wheresoever anyone may have his inclination settled in him, needs to be engaged in the same for his purification so that he may rise beyond the Lordship of the state of being concerned.
iti śrīpūrvakathitaṃ śrīmatsvāyambhuve'pica | yo yatrābhilaṣedbhogānsa tatraiva niyojitaḥ |	It has already been stated in the Svāyambhu Sāstra also that wheresoever anyone may be aspiring to reach, he needs to be associated with the path leading to the same destination.
siddhibhāṅmantrasāmarthyādityādyanyatra varṇitam | ye tu tattattvavijñānamantracaryādivartinaḥ | mṛtāste tatra tadrudrasayuktvaṃ yānti kovidāḥ | teṣāṃ sayuktvaṃ yātānāmapi saṃskārato nijāt |	Elsewhere also it is mentioned that by virtue of deserving to reach the same destination he is facilitated to reach the same by the force of the mantra concerned also. Those who are knowers of the Reality besides being enriched with the science and practice of mantra as also its application in life, etc., they, after their death, having become associated with the Rudra concerned reach the same end.
tathā tathā vicitraḥ syādavatārastadaṃśataḥ | siddhāntādau purāṇeṣu tathāca śrūyate bahu | tulye rudrāvatāratve citratvaṃ karmabhogayoḥ | anekaśaktikhacitaṃ yato bhāvasya yadvapuḥ |	In Tantras like Siddhānta as also in Purānas and the folklore it is often found how Rudras enjoy different states of being on account of their different kinds of performances in spite of lying in one and the same state of Rudra. Irrespective of the state of being, the body existing there on account of being equipped with the features characteristic to its nativity is sure to be adduced with the same kind of forces.
śaktibhyo'rthāntaraṃ naiṣa tatsamūhādṛte bhavet | tena śaktisamūhākhyāt tasmādrudrādyadaṃśataḥ | kṛtyaṃ taducitaṃ siddhyeta soṃ'śo'vatarati sphuṭam |	It cannot afford to survive there entirely apart from the corresponding features of the locus. On account of the state of Rudra being formed of the congregation of those very features, his accomplishments are also sure to have correspondence with Tantrāloka those features. This is the obvious logic behind his stay there as a part of Rudra concerned.
ye cādharaprāptadīkṣāstadāsthānujjhitāḥ pare | tattve mṛtāḥ kāṣṭhavatte'dhare'pyutkarṣabhāginaḥ | ye tūjjhitatadutkarṣāste taduttarabhāginaḥ |	-a Those who have been initiated to reach any lower state of being but happen to die in the range of any higher state of being in spite of continuing to cherish aspiration for their earlier one, they are destined to remain on the lower ladder of being itself, however, with the prospect of rising higher to it also.
ye'pyūrdhvatattvadīkṣāste vinā tāvadvivekataḥ | prāptādharāntā api taddīkṣāphalasubhāginaḥ |	Those, on the other hand, who have been initiated for going to the higher ladder of the state of being are sure to reach the end of the lower state and enjoy the amenities of the higher.
atyaktāsthā hi te tatra dīkṣāyāmapi śāstritāt | vinā vivekādāsthāṃ te śritā lokaprasiddhitaḥ |	If they continue to cherish their faith in their initiation which was administered as per the rule of the śāstra and yet lack in the understanding of the logic behind it under the effect of the popular belief, they have to remain in the same state of being.
paśumātrasya sālokyaṃ sāmīpyaṃ dīkṣitasya tu | tatparasya tu sāyujyamityuktaṃ parameśinā |	b- Lord Siva has observed that those who lie on the ladder of the animality, continue to remain on the same ladder, those who get the privilege of initiation before their demise, they draw close to the Divine while those who develop aspiration for Him have the prospective of becoming one with Him.
yastūrdhvaśāstragastatra tyaktāsthaḥ saṃśayena saḥ | vrajannāyatanaṃ naiva phalaṃ kiñcitsamaśnute |	He, on the other hand, does not get anything who even having gone through the elevating Sāstras has no faith in them due to being doubtful about their teachings and moves around in holy places.
ukta tadviṣayaṃ caitaddevadevena yadvṛthā | dīkṣā jñānaṃ tathā tīrthaṃ tasyetyādi savistaram | yastu tāvadayogyo'pi tathāste sa śivālaye | paścādāsthānibandhena tāvadeva phalaṃ bhajet |	Lord Śiva has stated that initiation, knowledge, visit to sacred places are futile for him who lacks in faith in their results. Contrary to it he who has faith in them, in spite of lacking in understanding about them, dwells in the abode of Śiva and develops faith in Him, has the prospect of reaping the fruits in keeping with the extent of his devotion.
nadīnagahradaprāyaṃ yacca puṇyaṃ na tanmṛtau | utkṛṣṭaṃ tanmṛtānāṃ svargabhogopabhogitā |	Sanctity acquired through death at the bank of rivers, peaks of mountains, close to reservoir of water, etc. does not do anything in getting any higher state of being except for attaining the state of heavenly enjoyment.
ye punaḥ prāptavijñānavivekā maraṇāntike | adharāyataneṣvāsthāṃ śritāste'tra tirohitāḥ | tajjñānadūṣaṇoktaṃ yatteṣāṃ syātkila pātakam | tattatpureśadīkṣādikramānnaśyediti sthitiḥ |	Whatever sin they acquire through condemnation of that knowledge concerning the Lords of the states of being, the initiation for access to them is sure to be lost therein. Those who in their consciousness are used to condemn the science of initiation and track the same path of disdain practically in their lives, they are destined to go down to hell.
jñānāyatanadīkṣādāvāsthābandhaparicyutiḥ | vyāpāravyāhatairjñeyā tānyapi dvividhāni ca |	- Tantrāloka Failure to remain sustained in the state of knowledgeability and faith in the place of initiation, etc. is obvious from its denomination itself and it is of two kinds.
yāni jātucidapyeva svāsthye nodamiṣanpunaḥ asvāsthye dhātudoṣotthānyeva tadbhogamātrakatam | |	The state in which the aspirant remains self-contained has not to fall back, while if not self-contained he would have to suffer from the fault of imbalance in the contents of his being and would have to undergo another cycle of enjoyment and suffering.
dhātudoṣācca saṃsārasaṃskārāste prabodhitāḥ | chidragā api bhūyiṣṭhajñānadagdhā na rohiṇaḥ | | ye tu kaivalyabhāgīyāḥ svāsthye'nunmiṣitāḥ sadā | asvāsthye conmiṣantyete saṃskārāḥ śaktipātataḥ |	- Due to imbalance in the contents of the being worldly impressions get awakened and in spite of tending to fault, remain stopped from sprouting having been burnt by the heat of adequate knowledge. The impressions making him tend to liberation, on the other hand, remaining folded in the state of self-contentment get awakened in the state of deviation from the state of self-contentment due to the effect of the descent of the Force.
yataḥ sāṃsārikāḥ pūrvagāḍhābhyāsopasaṃskṛtāḥ| ityūce bhujagādhīśastacchidreṣviti sūtrataḥ | |	- Since impressions of worldliness have the history of long chain of cognate impressions behind them, they tend to unfold themselves in the state of unawareness in that continuity; this has been stated by the Lord of Serpents.
ye tū kaivalyabhāgīyāḥ pratyayāste na jātucit | abhyastāḥ saṃsṛterbhāvāttenaite śaktipātataḥ | |	The impressions favourable to liberation, on the other hand, due to lack of any such chain of practice behind them in course of the process of becoming, they have no other way to account for their emergence except for the descent of the Force.
vyāpāravyāhṛtaistena dhātudoṣaprakopitaiḥ| aprāptaniścayāmarśaiḥ suptamattopamānakaiḥ | viparītairapi jñānadīkṣāgurvādidūṣakaiḥ | tirobhāvo na vijñeyo hṛdaye ruḍhyabhāvataḥ |	Incidental emergence of diversionary tendencies in knowledgeable ones also may be explicable in terms of their adverse actions, imbalance in the constituents of their personality, lack of steadiness in their contemplation in regard to liberation, lack of wakefulness as also due to the fault of their knowledge, initiation, the teacher, etc. besides the lack of the idea of oneness with Śiva not having got duly rooted in their hearts.
ata eva prabuddho'pi karmotthānbhogarūpiṇaḥ | yamakiṅkarasarpādipratyayāndehago bhajet | |	- This is why even an enlightened person is prone to suffer from the results of his actions like an embodied being suffering the pang of death from the bite of a serpent as the worker of Yama, the God of Death.
naitāvatā na mukto'sau mṛtirbhogo hi janmavat | sthitivacca tato duḥkhasukhābhyāṃ maraṇaṃ dvidhā |	This, however, does not negate the possibility of his getting liberated, for death in his case amounts to the state of enjoyment as equal to birth and sustenance and thus taking two forms, as one of suffering and the other that of enjoyment.
ato yathā prabuddhasya sukhaduḥkhavicitratāḥ | sthitau na ghnanti muktatvaṃ maraṇe'pi tathaiva tāḥ |	Therefore, as variations of pleasure and pain do not affect the enlightened even so he does not get affected in his liberation be it availed of in the state of sustenance or death.
ye punaryoginaste'pi yasmiṃstattve subhāvitāḥ | cittaṃ niveśayantyeva tattattvaṃ yāntyaśaṅkitāḥ |	Tantrāloka As regards the yogins, they also get assimilated to the same essences which they would have practised to get one with without any doubt.
śrīsvacchande tataḥ proktaṃ gandhadhāraṇayā mṛtāḥ | ityādi mālinīśāstre dhāraṇānāṃ tathā phalam | |	It has been observed in the Svacchanda Tantra as also in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra that those who die having fixed their dhāranā on the essence of smell, their death amounts to such a kind of enjoyment as an easy and quick entrance into another body.
eteṣāṃ maraṇābhikhyo bhogo nāsti tu ye tanum | dhāraṇābhistyajantyāśu paradehapraveśavat |	Those do not suffer from the pang of death who leave the body having sustained themselves in their contemplations. For them, death is like entering into another body.
etāvānmṛtibhogo hi marmacchinmūḍhatākṣagā | dhvāntābilatvaṃ manasi taccaiteṣu na vidyate |	Their senses do not become paralysed in their respective functions and the mind does not have to feel as if it has to enter into the tunnel of darkness.
tathāhi mānasaṃ yatnaṃ tāvatsamadhitiṣṭhati | ahaṃrūṃḍhyā pare dehe yāvatsyādbuddhisaṃcaraḥ |	All mental efforts get transmitted to the other body till the intellect continues its operation there along with the sense of I-ness. So does the entire circle of life- forces and the group of senses.
makṣikā makṣikārājaṃ yathotthitamanūtthitāḥ | sthitaṃ cānuviśantyevaṃ cittaṃ sarvākṣavṛttayaḥ |	- Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... As honey-bees get awakened following the awakening of their queen, follow her suit in their sitting; even so do the senses in relationship to the inner organ of consciousness citta .
ato'sya paradehādisaṃcāre nāsti melanam | akṣāṇāṃ madhyagaṃ sūkṣmaṃ syādetaddehavatpunaḥ |	Therefore, while operating in the other body, the senses of the yogin have not to get dissolved in their respective essences. Their forces remain intact in the midst of the senses themselves in the subtle form.
evaṃ paraśarīrādicāriṇāmiva yoginām | tattattattvaśarīrāntaścāriṇāṃ nāsti mūḍhatā |	Thus, just as it happens in the case of yogins operating from within another body while remaining associated with their own so it happens in the case of knowers of the essences operating from another body without getting anyway rid of their knowledge.
te cāpi dvividhā jñeyā laukikā dīkṣitāstathā | pūrve śivāḥ syuḥ kramaśaḥ pare tadbhogamātrataḥ |	Yogins are also of two kinds, popular and initiated. The former have the prospect of becoming one with Siva via meditation and samādhi while the latter knowingly via enjoyment.
dīkṣāpyūrdhvādharānekabhedayojanikāvaśāt| bhidyamānā yogināṃ syādvicitraphaladāyinī | |	As regards the initiated ones, their initiation is divided into the higher and the lower kinds as per the device of the factor of unification with Siva used with different consequences.
ye tu vijñāninaste'tra dvedhā kampretaratvataḥ | tatra ye kampravijñānāste dehānte śivāḥ sphuṭam |	- As regards the destiny of the knowledgeable ones, they are of two kinds as per Tantrāloka their motivation by the kind of Force they are motivated by. If they know the secret of the Force, they become one with Śiva without any doubt following their demise.
yato vijñānameteṣāmutpannaṃ naca susphuṭam | vikalpāntarayogena nacāpyunmūlitātmakam |	This is so because although the right knowledge has emerged within them yet not so clearly on account of the intermixture of options in their knowledge with ignorance which has not been rooted out completely.
ato dehe pramādottho vikalpo dehapātataḥ | naśyedavaśyaṃ taccāpi budhyate jñānamuttamam |	This is why it is only when the body as the cause of the deviation gets dropped that they become sure of awakening of the true knowledge from within them.
saṃskārakalpanātiṣṭhadadhvastīkṛtamantarā | prāptapāka saṃvarīturapāye bhāsate hi tat |	On elimination of the obstruction in the form of impressions of past actions and imaginations which until now had kept its illumination bedimmed, following their maturation, their consciousness gets illumined.
ye tu svabhyastavijñānamayāḥ śivamayāḥ sadā | jīvanmuktā hi te naiṣāṃ mṛtau kāpi vicāraṇā |	The case of those, on the other hand, is different from who have practised prefectly the right knowledge in their lives and thus have become filled up with sense of their oneness with Siva. They have automatically become liberated even while continuing to live.
yathāhi jīvanmuktānāṃ sthitau nāsti vicāraṇā| sukhidukhivimūḍhatve mṛtāvapi tathā na sā |	As is the case of liberation of those who have become liberated in life itself including interception of states of the experience of pleasure, pain and dormancy, even so is the case of really knowledgeable ones in regard to their attaining the state of liberation.
śrīratnamālāśāstre taduvāca parameśvaraḥ | svaśāstre cāpyahīśāno viśvādhāradhurandharaḥ | rathyāntare mūtrapurīṣamadhye caṇḍālagehe niraye śmaśāne | sacintako vā gatacintako vā jñānī vimokṣaṃ labhate'pi cānte | apiceti dhvanirjīvanmuktatāmasya bhāṣate | sacintācintakatvoktiretāvatsaṃbhavasthitim | |	Lord Śiva has stated in the Sāstra known as Ratnamālā that the Lord of serpents as the bearer of the burden of the entire universe on his head has observed as follows in his text : “Be he made to live to in the middle of the path, in the midst of urine and excreta, in the house of a cleaner of the two objects of hatred, in the cremation ground and be he a thinker or not at all, he is sure to attain liberation only if he is knowledgeable.” - The words api ca in the previous verse suggest to his state of liberation while the expression sa cintako gatacintako vā confirms the same state of him in any case howsoever self-contradictory.
tīrthe śvapacagṛhe vā naṣṭasmṛtirapi parityajeddeham | jñānasamakālamuktaḥ kaivalyaṃ yāti hataśokaḥ |	The expression tirtha svapaca grhe vā nasta-smrtir api is significatory of his attainment of liberation immediately without the experience of anguish on his part.
anantakārikā caiṣā prāheda bandhaka kila | sukṛtaṃ duṣkṛtaṃ cāsya śaṅkayaṃ taccāsya no bhavet | |	Tantrāloka The text Anantakārikā also has observed that his actions cannot be suspected to prove binding for him whether they be noble or ignoble.
apiśabdādaluptasmṛtyā vā saṃbhāvyate kila | mṛtirnaṣṭasmṛtereva mṛteḥ prāk sāstu kiṃ tayā | liṅca saṃbhāvanāyāṃ syādiyatsaṃbhāvyate kila | saca kāladhvaniḥ prāha mṛtermuktāvahetutām | | kaivalyamiti cāśaṅkāpadaṃ yāpyabhavattanuḥ | bhedapradatvenaiṣāpi dhvastā tena viśokatā |	Use of word api there is implicatory of continuance of memory also as well as its loss having to do nothing in his attainment of the state of liberation. Use of the optative mood in the verbal form of tyajet, signifying possibility, is suggestive of the course of time in regard to liberation rather than being anyway affective of the possibility of his attaining to the state of liberation itself. Whatever interval of time seems to appear between the moment of death and that of attainment of liberation from the use of the words kaivalya and yāti, it also gets annulled by the use of the expression hatasokah.
paradehādisaṃbandho yathā nāsya vibhedakaḥ | tathā svadehasaṃbandho jīvanmuktasya yadyapi |	As association, etc. with other's body do not affect the state of liberation of the yogin, even so does the association of the knower of the Reality with his own body.
ataśca na viśeṣo'sya viśvākṛtinirākṛteḥ | śivābhinnasya dehe vā tadabhāve'pi vā kila |	Due to his having become one with Śiva, it makes no difference in him to be embodied or disembodied and even associated with the world or dissociated from it.
tathāpi prācyatadbhedasaṃskārāśaṅkanasthiteḥ | adhunoktaṃ kevalatvaṃ yadvā mātrantarāśrayāt | tānyenaṃ na vidurbhinnaṃ taiḥ sa mukto'bhidhīyate | śrīmattraiśirase'pyuktaṃ sūryendupuṭavarjite | jugupsābhāvabhaṅgasthe sarvataḥ stambhavatsthite | sarvavyāpattirahite pramāṇapratyayātige | | tasminbodhāntare līnaḥ karmakartāpyanañjanaḥ | pradhānaṃ ghaṭa ākāśa ātmā naṣṭe ghaṭe'pi kham | |	Due to the effect of previous impressions there may lurk the sense of his bodily status as different from the liberated one and yet he may have got librated while still alive just like the yogin embodying a different personality from which he is sure to be considered as liberated after the fall of it. -a It has been observed in the Traisiras Sāstra also that on stoppage of the functions of pingalā and idā nerves and breakdown of the sense of hatred and the aspirant's coming to stay equally well for all alike a pillar, bereft from all attractions and distractions, resulting in transcendence of all dichotomy of the canon of verification and object of it, the Self becomes engaged in a different kind of awareness, unaffected by the duality of action and the doer like the space inside the jar becoming one with the space itself on the breaking of it.
na naśyettadvadevāsāvātmā śivamayo bhavet | svatantro'vasthito jñānī prasaretsarvavastuṣu | tasya bhāvo nacābhāva saṃsthānaṃ naca kalpanā | etadevāntarāgūrya gururgītāsvabhāṣata |	b- Similarly, in the case of the demise of such a self-realised person there is no loss on his side except for his having become one with Siva, existing free of all Tantrāloka limiting adjuncts and pervading all alike having transcended the qualifications of existence and non-existence both as well as locus and object of imagination.
yaṃ yaṃ vāpi smaranbhāvaṃ tyajatyante kalevaram | taṃ tamevaiti kaunteya sadā tadbhāvabhāvitaḥ |	This is the purport of the statement of the Bhagavadgītā in its observation as follows: “Whatever idea may be cherished by the person concerned at the time of his demise, the same gets concretised in his post-mortal state, O son of Kunti, as a result of the same kind of contemplation.
tasmātsarveṣu kāleṣu māmanusmara yudhya ca | yadā sattve vivṛddhe tu pralīnastvūrdhvagastadā | kramādrajastamolīnaḥ karmayonivimūḍhagaḥ | tatrendriyāṇāṃ saṃmohaśvāsāyāsaparītatā | ityādimṛtibhogo'yaṃ dehe na tyajanaṃ tanoḥ | yastvasau kṣaṇa evaikaścaramaḥ prāṇanātmakaḥ |	Therefore, keep myself reminded of in your mind on all moments and engage yourself in the battle." -a When anyone leaves the body in the state of predominance of the satoguna, he rises upward while he falls to the category of doers of actions on leaving the body in the state of predominance of rajoguna and that of dormancy in the state of predominance of the tamoguna. b-a Dormancy of the senses, difficulty of breathing, etc. at the time of death are simply sufferings of the occasion of death and have nothing to do with the death itself.
yadanantaramevaiṣa dehaḥ syātkāṣṭhakuḍyavat | sā dehatyāgakālāṃśakalā dehaviyoginī | |	b-a That is the last moment of breathing following which the body becomes like a Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... log of wood.
tata eva hi taddehasukhaduḥkhādikojjhitā | tasyāṃ yadeva smarati prāksaṃskāraprabodhataḥ | adṛṣṭābhyāsabhūyastvaśaktipātādihetukāt | tadeva rūpamabhyeti sukhiduḥkhivimūḍhakam | |	That fraction of time is known as the last moment of consciousness leaving the body. That moment is one of desertion of the experience of pleasure and pain. Whatever the person remembers at that moment is the result of all his previous impressions of life together due mainly to operation of unseen forces for whose emergence he had practised austerity, etc.
yadvā niḥsukhaduḥkhādi yadi vānandarūpakam | kasmādeti tadevaiṣa yataḥ smarati saṃvidi | prāk prasphuredyadadhikaṃ deho'sau cidadhiṣṭhiteḥ | yadeva prāgadhiṣṭhānaṃ citā tādātmyavṛttitaḥ |	This moment is followed by the state of dormancy absolutely bereft of the sense of pleasure as well as pain. Alternatively, he may experience sheer delight transcendent to the contrariety of pleasure and pain. In response to the why behind this peculiar alternative experience, the answer is the anticipatory experience of the state of being of consciousness going to get materialised.
saivātra līnatā proktā sattve rajasi tāmase | nīlapītādike jñeye yataḥ prākkalpitāṃ tanum | adhiṣṭhāyaiva saṃvittiradhiṣṭhānaṃ karotyalam | ato'dhiṣṭheyamātrasya śarīratve'pi kuḍyataḥ |	b- The status of the body as the locus of consciousness prior to the former's formation is due to the oneness between the two. As it is by basing itself on the ground of the body on the basis of identity with it that consciousness manifests itself which is said to be its merger into the gunas such as sattva, rajas and tamas as also in different kinds of objects like blue, yellow, etc.
dehasyāsti viśeṣo yatsarvādhiṣṭheyapūrvatā | tādātmyavṛttiranyeṣāṃ tanna satyapi vedyate | vedyānāṃ kintu dehasya nityāvyabhicaritvataḥ | sā ca tasyaiva dehasya pūrvamṛtyantajanmanā |	- Though consciousness abides within all the objects yet it manifests itself first of all through the body. The latter becomes pre-eminent amongst all the objects pervaded by itself. In spite of pervading everything on the ground of oneness, consciousness does not appear to be doing so except for the body where it pervades as well as remains constantly associated with it.
smṛtyā prācyānubhavanakṛtasaṃskāracitrayā | yuktyānayāsmatsantānaguruṇā kallaṭena yat |	-a Tantrāloka This kind of association of consciousness with body remains constant even during the interval between the moments of death and rebirth. It is due to that continuity of association that the individual happens to assume the new body in keeping with his contemplation at the time of his death.
dehāviśeṣe prāṇākhyadāḍhryaṃ heturudīritam | tadyuktamanyathā prāṇadārḍhya ko heturekataḥ | dehatvasyāviśeṣe'pītyeṣa praśno na śāmyati | smaranniti śatā hetau tadrūpaṃ pratipadyate | | prāk smaryate yato dehaḥ prākcitādhiṣṭhitaḥ sphuran | ataḥ smaraṇamantyaṃ yattadasarvajñamātṛṣu | |	b-a How is it that just on the basis of his keeping intact the memory of his contemplation at the time of his death the individual happens to assume the particular kind of body and not that of any kind else as he has the possibility of contemplating of hundreds of other things? The answer to this objection is that he comes to assume that particular kind of body on account of having been lying in that kind of body until now as also on account of lacking in the awareness of his all-pervasiveness and therefore there is uncertainty about things other than that.
na jātu gocaro yasmāddehāntaraviniścayaḥ | yattu bandhupriyāputrapānādismaraṇaṃ sphuṭam |	Whichever obvious memory crops up on the verge of leaving the body concerning friends, wife, son, enjoyments, etc., it has nothing to do with the future life as it is not going to determine the same any way.
na taddehāntarāsaṅgi na tadantyaṃ yato bhavet | kasyāpi tu śarīrānte vāsanā yā prabhotsyate | dehasattve tadaucityājjāyetānubhavaḥ sphuṭaḥ| yathā purāṇe kathitaṃ mṛgapotakatṛṣṇayā | muniḥ ko'pi mṛgībhāvamabhyuvāhādhivāsitaḥ | tatra so'nubhavo heturna janmāntarasūtaye | | tasyaitadvāsanā hetuḥ kākatālīyavat sa tu |	b-a If it happens in a particular case that whatever wish he entertains in his mind at the time of death while lying still embodied on account of cognate experience, the same he gets materialised in his next life as is evidenced by the Purānic story of a certain sage who having become occupied by his affection towards a young doe having become a doe in his next birth due to that wish of him, it is that desire of him which serves as the cause in the determination of his next birth and not he himself, the coincidence between the wish and the shape of the rebirth being as incidental as the falling of the coconut fruit and dying of the bird getting hurt by it.
nanu kasmāttadevaiṣa smarati ityāha yatsadā | | tadbhāvabhāvitastena tadevaiṣa smaratyalam | evamasmi bhaviṣyāmītyeṣa tadbhāva ucyate | bhaviṣyato hi bhavanaṃ bhāvyate na sataḥ kvacit | kramātsphuṭatvakaraṇaṃ bhāvanaṃ parikīrtyate | |	b-a Now the question is: Why is it that the person concerned happens to remember the same thing which he is going to get materialised in his next life ? The answer to this question is that he comes to be reminded of the thing on account of his having been preoccupied by the same wish long since in the form of the idea “ I am like this and I will become like this.” This is the course of contemplation. Contemplation always remains inclined towards what is supposed to happen instead of remaining restricted to the present status of things.
sphuṭasya cānubhavanaṃ na bhavanamidaṃ sphuṭam | tadaharjātabālasya paśo kīṭasya vā taroḥ | mūḍhatve'pi tadānīṃ prāgbhāvanā hyabhavatsphuṭā| sā tanmūḍhaśarīrānte saṃskārapratibodhanāt | smṛtidvāreṇa taddehavaicitryaphaladāyinī| deśādivyavadhāne'pi vāsanānāmudīritāt |	b-a Tantrāloka Contemplation is the tool of clarifying what is expected to take place in the future and by no means what is happening at present. b-a Irrespective of the victim of death being a child born on the same day, an animal or a worm, or even a tree, with all its dormancy of awareness at the moment, whatever had happened in course of its previous experiences, the same gets manifested from its impressions lying latent within it on the fall of its body lying in the state of morbidity at the moment and yield the results of those actions through the memory with all their peculiarities.
ānantaryaikarūpatvātsmṛtisaṃskārayorataḥ | tathānubhavanārūḍhyā sphuṭasyāpi tu bhāvitā | bhāvyamānā na kiṃ sūte tatsantānasadṛgvapuḥ | tattādṛktādṛśairbandhuputramitrādibhiḥ saha |	b-a In spite of the gap of space and time since their occurrence, owing to the factor of continuity filling up the same by means of memory and impression settled out of the experience recreating the same situation kindred to the original one, the person concerned finds himself surrounded by the same kind of relatives, sons, friends, etc. in the other world also like dreamy figures on account of the past impressions.
bhāsate'pi pare loke svapnavadvāsanākramāt | nanu mātrantarairbandhuputrādyaistattathā na kim |	Now the question is whether or not the person lying on the death-bed what he himself sees in the state of the last moments of his life is perceptible to other knowers on the site or not.
vedyate ka idaṃ prāha sa tāvadveda vedyatām | vyāpāravyāhṛtivrātavedye mātrantaravraje | svapne nāsti sa ityeṣā vākpramāṇavivarjitā | ya evaite tu dṛśyante jāgratyete mayekṣitāḥ | svapna ityastu mithyaitattatpramātṛvacobalāt | yānapaśyamahaṃ svapne pramātṛste na kecana |	This may be obvious from the case of the figures of the dream happening to be seen by the dreamer alone. It is obvious that whatever complex objects and events the dreamer sees is not perceptible to anyone else however close to the dreamer be he but there is no evidence to prove whether the dreamer is aware of this or not. b-a This much, however, is evident that on being enquired like this he is sure to state whatever he saw in the state of dream was almost like the same which had appeared to him in the waking state previously proving that the figures of dream are false appearances seeming to be real to the dreamer alone.
na śocanti na cekṣante māmityatrāsti kā pramā|	b-a The knowers whom I saw in the state of dream, they are none nor do they express their grief over my plight nor even look towards me.
yataḥ sarvānumānānāṃ svasaṃvedananiṣṭhiau |	What is the proof of it? b-a Since the crux of all inferences in regard to itself as well as its agent remains confined to one's consciousness, its awareness can be had only through the locus of it.
pramātrantarasadbhāvaḥ saṃvinniṣṭho na tadgataḥ | ghaṭāderastitā saṃvinniṣṭhitā natu tadgatā |	lies in the awareness of the same in consciousness and not in the existing object itself. So is the case of the existence of the dreamy figures in their awareness and by no means in their locus.
tadvanmātrantare'pyeṣā saṃviniṣṭhā na tadgatā | tena sthitamidaṃ yadyadbhāvyate tattadeva hi |	b- a Thus, it becomes settled that whatever appears is its essence. Whether anyone knows of his state of being following the fall of his body or not, leave it to get settled by itself.
dehānte budhyate no cet syādanyadṛkprabodhanam | tathāhyantyakṣaṇe brahmavidyākarṇanasaṃskṛtaḥ | | mucyate janturityuktaṃ prāksaṃskārabalatvataḥ| nipātābhyāmantaśabdātsmaraṇācchaturantyataḥ |	b-a For instance, by virtue of listening to deliberation on the Ultimate Reality the self of the aspirant becomes cultured particularly on account of the background of his previous practices and gets redeemed. b-a From the use of the two words of stray nature namely, vā and api in one and the same line signifying the other alternative to the destiny of the individual's soul besides that of redemption brought in here in the Bhagavadgītā's verse VIII., in the context of disappearance of it from the present body, it is obvious that there is continuity in the entire process from life to death and rebirth.
pādācca nikhilādardhaślokācca samanantarāt | līnaśabdācca sarvaṃ taduktamarthasatattvakam | ajñātvaitattu sarve'pi kuśakāśāvalambinaḥ | yattadorvyatyayaṃ kecitkecidanyādṛśaṃ kramam | bhinnakramau nipātau ca tyajatīti ca saptamīm | vyācakṣate tacca sarvaṃ nopayogyuktayojane | |	b- Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... Due to ignorance of this sense while some of the hypocrites rearrange the order of words derived from the pronouns yat and tat and some other ones by kindred distortions in the text such as changing the order between the stray words nipāta, namely, vā and api as also by mistaking the word tyajati as the present tense third case singular instead of the present participial form of the root tyaj in the seventh singular termination misinterpreted the entire sense of the verse hiding their ignorance about it.
naca taddarśitaṃ mithyā svāntasammohadāyakam| taditthaṃprāyaṇasyaitattattvaṃ śrīśambhunāthataḥ |	Having understood it like this from my honourable teacher Sambhunātha, I have presented the above here for the sake of warding off the fear of death.
adhigamyoditaṃ tena mṛtyorbhītirvinaśyati | viditamṛtisatattvāḥ saṃvidambhonidhānā dacalahṛdayavīryākarṣaniṣpīḍanottham | amṛtamiti nigīrṇe kālakūṭe'tra devā | yadi pibatha tadānīṃ niścitaṃ vaḥ śivatvam |	-a Having understood the secret of mortality as a result of the understanding of the mystery of the sea of Consciousness churned out by means of the eternal perpetuity of the Supreme Being lying in the heart as distinct from the poison drunk by Siva, O gods, you drink it and therein would become guaranteed your Śiva-hood. This amounts to suggest the significance of the exhilarating nature of worldly celebrations also as a wave on the sea of Consciousness.
etena ca vipaddhvaṃsapramodādiṣu parvatā | vyākhyātā tena tatrāpi viśeṣāddevatārcanam |	This explains also the celibratory character of occasions of end of the moments of trouble, etc. particularly on account of creating the opportunity of worshipping the deities.
purakṣobhādyadbhutaṃ yattatsvātantrye svasaṃvidaḥ | dārḍhyadāyīti tallābhadine vaiśeṣikārcanam | |	Tantrāloka Arrival of the day on which some disturbance took place in the town and happened to be warded off may be celebrated particularly in the form of worship of the deity.
yoginīmelako dvedhā haṭhataḥ priyatastathā | prācye cchidrāṇi saṃrakṣetkāmacāritvamuttare |	Meeting with yogini is made possible in a twofold manner, namely, by way of regulating breathing through the solar and lunar channels and through the cultivation of fascination for Consciousness.
sa ca dvayo'pi mantroddhṛ darśayiṣyate | mantroddhṛtprasaṅge	This difference between the two would be elucidated while dealing with the theme of evolving the mantra.
yoginīmelakāccaiṣo'vaśyaṃ jñānaṃ prapadyate | tena tatpūrva tadvacca svasantānādimelanam | saṃvitsarvātmikā dehabhedādyā saṅkucettu sā |	b-a Consciousness is pervasive of all and yet at the same time it tends to get contracted in the individual. However, when the aspirant and the yogini meet together, they act on each other resulting in the blooming of both on account of becoming reflected in each other.
melake'nyonyasaṅghaṭṭapratibimbādvikasvarā | ucchalannijaraśmyoghaḥ saṃvitsu pratibimbita | bahudarpaṇavaddīptaḥ sarvāyetāpyayatnataḥ | ata eva gītagītaprabhṛtau bahuparṣada | | yaḥ sarvatanmayībhāve hlādo natvekakasya saḥ | ānandanirbharā saṃvitpratyeka sā tathaikatām |	A group of rays of consciousness emanating from oneself getting deflected in the consciousness individualised in several persons has the possibility of being visible in all of them spontaneously as it happens in mirrors placed all around anything. b-a This is how it gets elucidated in any musical programme participated in by several musicians as well as a large number of connoisseurs of music enjoying the performance collectively instead of individually. b-a The consciousness becoming replete with delight within each one of the audience coalesces with others in such programmes of music, dance, etc.
nṛttādau viṣaye prāptā pūrṇānandatvamaśnute |	resulting in the experience of delight of perfect nature.
īrṣyāsūyādisaṅkocakāraṇābhāvato'tra sā |	b-a In such programmes due to absence of envy and grudge, etc.
vikasvarā niṣpratighaṃ saṃvidānandayoginī |	operating as factors of contraction, consciousness happens to get rid of restraint and comes to bloom fully and become perfectly delightful.
atanmaye tu kasmiṃścittatrasthe pratihanyate | sthapuṭasparśavatsaṃvidvijātīyatayā sthite | ataścakrārcanādyeṣu vijātīyamatanmayam | naiva praveśayetsaṃvitsaṅkocananibandhanam | yāvantyeva śarīrāṇi svāṅgavatsyuḥ sunirbharām | |	b-a If anyone of the audience lacks in the capacity of becoming one with the rest of the listeners, he is left out from the sway of the delight in the same way as do lower points of a drawing drawn on an uneven background. b-a Tantrāloka This is why in programmes of worship of cakras, etc. such persons should not be allowed to attend who are incongruent to it on account of constriction of consciousness.
ekāṃ saṃvidamāviśya cakre tāvanti pūjayet | praviṣṭaścetpramādena saṅkocaṃ na vrajettataḥ | | prastutaṃ svasamācāraṃ tena sākaṃ samācaret | sa tvanugrahaśaktyā cedviddhastattanmayī bhavet | |	b-a Only such bodies need to be worshipped as one's own which might be capable of entering into one and the same stream of consciousness exclusively. b- a If anyone may happen to enter into the programme inadvertently, the worshipper should not behave with him in any untoward manner but should rather perform the acts in company with him. b-a If fortunately he becomes positively impressed by the ceremonies, the performer should join with him in his experience of joy.
vāmāviddhastu tannindetpaścāttaṃ ghātayedapi | śrīmatpicumate coktamādau yatnena rakṣayet | | praveśaṃ saṃpraviṣṭasya na vicāraṃ tu kārayet | lokācārasthito yastu praviṣṭe tādṛśe tu saḥ |	b-a According to the view of the Picu śāstra, in the beginning one should see that no undeserving enter on the spot of worship or into the area of performance. However, if entered into at all, he should be behaved with in the normal way. b-a Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... If anyone of sheer worldly interests arrives in the beginning of the ceremony, the worship should be postponed for that day to be performed on the next.
akṛtvā taṃ samācāraṃ punaścakraṃ prapūjayet | atha vacmi guroḥ śāstravyākhyākramamudāhṛtam | devyāyāmalaśāstrādau tuhinābhīśumaulinā | kalpavittatsamūhajñaḥ śāstravitsaṃhitārthavit | | sarvaśāstrārthavicceti gururbhinno'padiśyate | yo yatra śāstre svabhyastajñāno vyākhyāṃ carettu saḥ | |	b-a Now, I am going to talk about the qualifications of a teacher concerning his worthiness to explain texts determinative of the basic principles śāstra of the discipline concerned as have been laid down by Lord Siva in texts like Devyāyāmala Tantra, etc. b-a The teacher should be aeonian in his understanding, knower of the entire such span of time in its details, knower of the code of conduct in regard to it, the basic principles of it, knower of the sense of all the texts expository of it as well as that of the pattern of behaviour befitting his understanding of the principles.
nānyathā tadbhāvaścetsarvathā so'pyathācaret |	If he be lacking in this feature, he should be trying to come up to the norm in this respect as well.
śrībhairavakule coktaṃ kalpādijñatvamīdṛśam | |	b-a Tantrāloka The aeonian knowledge, etc. have been expected of the teacher in the text known as Bhairavakula.
gurorlakṣaṇametāvatsaṃpūrṇajñānataiva yā| tatrāpi yāsya cidvṛttikarmibhit sāpyavāntarā | |	According to it the characteristic feature of a teacher lies in his knowledgeability of everything. In addition to his knowledge, he should have aptitude for implementation of his knowledge in the form of action.
devyāyāmala uktaṃ taddvāpañcāśāhna āhnike | deva eva gurutvena tiṣṭhāsurdaśadhā bhavet | | ucchuṣmaśavaracaṇḍagumataṅgaghorāntakograhalahalakāḥ | krodhī huluhulurete daśa guravaḥ śivamayāḥ pūrve | |	This has been laid down in the Devyāyāmala Tantra's fifty-second chapter. It is Lord Siva who wishing to manifest Himself has assumed the form of the ten teachers as follows: b- Ucchusmānśa, Śabarārnśa, Candamsa, Matangāmśa, Ghorāntaka, Antakamsa, Ugrāmsa, Halāhalakārnśa, Krodhārmśa and Huluhulu. All these teachers have been filled with the idea of Śiva.
te svāṃśacittavṛttikrameṇa pauruṣaśarīramāsthāya | anyonyabhinnasaṃvitkriyā api jñānaparipūrṇā |	They followed the modes of inner being they severally represented by assuming human bodies as distinct from one another cognitively as well as conatively.
sarve'limāṃsanidhuvanadīkṣārcanaśāstrasevane niratāḥ | abhimānaśamakrodhakṣamādiravāntaro bhedaḥ |	They did not abstain from eating meat and drinking wine and yet remained always engaged in initiation of students to their disciplines, worship of Siva, and study of texts. They were replete with the sense of self-respect, peace, anger, forgiveness and similar qualities with their specific mutual differences.
itthaṃ vijñāya sadā śiṣyaḥ sampūrṇaśāstraboddhāram | vyākhyāyaigurumabhyarthayet pūjāpura saraṃ matimān | so'pi svaśāsanīye paraśiṣye'pi vāpi tādṛśaṃ śāstram | śrotuṃ yogye kuryāt vyākhyānaṃ vaiṣṇavādyadhare | |	Deliberation on Incidental Rites and Celebrations... Having understood this background of the discipline the wise disciple should take resort to such a teacher respectfully who might be knower of the Sāstra in its entirety so that he himself may become capable of imparting initiation to his own disciples as well as to those of others engaged until now in such lower kinds of disciplines as Vaisnavism, etc.
karūṇārasaparipūrṇe guru punarmarmadhāmaparivarjam | adhame'pi hi vyākuryā tsambhāvya hi śaktipātavaicitryam | |	The teacher should impart initiation to disciples engaged in lower disciplines also until now out of his compassion towards them except for disclosure of the top secrets of it in view of the peculiarity of the descent of the grace on them also even without sufficient effort on their part in order to avoid the danger of its misuse from their side.
liptāyāṃ bhuvi pīṭhe caturastre paṅkajatrayaṃ kajage| kuryādvidyāpīṭhaṃ syādrasavahvyaṅgulaṃ tvetat |	- The spot chosen as the seat of initiation needs to be besmeared with cow-dung. It needs to be quadrangular with thirty-six finger-ends in length and breadth.
madhye vāgīśānīṃ dakṣottarayorgurūngaṇeśaṃ ca| adhare kaje ca kalpeśvaraṃ prapūjyārghapuṣpatarpaṇakaiḥ | | |	Three lotus flowers should be placed on it dedicated to the sun in the middle as the Lord of the goddess of words, teachers on the right side and to Lord Ganesa on the left while to the Lord of time on the lower side of it. All these gods and Lords should be worshipped with the offering of flowers and other materials of worship.
sāmānyavidhiyuktā rghapātrayogena cakramatha samyak | santarpya vyākhyānaṃ kuryātsambandhapūrvakaṃ matimān |	- Making use of the vessel of worship as per the common mode of worship, the wise teacher should satiate the circle followed by exposition of the system to the pupil in a consistent manner.
sambandhāt | sūtrapadavākyapaṭalagranthakramayojanena avyāhatapūrvāparamupavṛhya nayeta vākyāni | maṇḍūkaplavasiṃhāvalokanādyairyathāyathaṃ nyāyaiḥ | avihatapūrvāparaka śāstrārthaṃ yojayedasaṅkīrṇam | tantrāvartanabādhaprasaṅgatarkādibhiśca sannyāyaiḥ | vastu vadedvākyajño vastvanatarato viviktatāṃ vidadhat |	Tantrāloka The mode of exposition of the system should involve knitting together words, sentences, chapters, the whole text in a certain order with relevance of the initiation and final parts with each other in the whole of the exposition as well as in each one of its constituents including even sentences. By taking recourse to the mode of the frog's jump as also the lion's way of looking back and similar progressions and reversions on occasions without any drift from beginning to end he needs to sustain the entire argument behind his exposition in a broad way. He may move behind sometimes to strengthen his arguments further and thus put up his statements in a better perspective in view of the content as well as each one of the statements in mutual relationships, eliminating the danger of any future criticism.
yadyadvyāhṛtipadavīmāyāti tadeva dṛḍhatarairnyāyaiḥ | balavatkuryāddṛṣyaṃ yadyapyagre bhaviṣyatsyāt |	- Any viewpoint presented against the background of a forceful opposite view gets settled in the mind of the pupil in a form immune to doubt and drift.
bhāṣā nyāyo vādo layaḥ kramo yadyadeti śiṣyasya | sambodhopāyatvaṃ tathaiva gururāśrayedvyākhyām |	The teacher should take help of anyone of the devices of communication such as language, logic, argument, rhythm and order to convey his viewpoint to the disciple properly.
vācyaṃ vastu samāpya pratarpaṇaṃ pūjanaṃ bhaveccakre | punaraparaṃ vastu vadetpaṭalādūrdhvaṃ tu no jalpet | vyākhyānte kṣamayitvā visṛjya sarvaṃ kṣipedagādhajale | śāstrādimadhyanidhane viśeṣataḥ pūjanaṃ kuryāt |	Having finished the talk of that occasion's discourse, the teacher should move to satiation and worship of the circle and shift to the other one without transgressing the limits of the chapter. At the end of the exposition, excusal from the deities concerned should be begged for and all the material used in the worship needs to be thrown in some deep reservoir of water. If unfortunately anyone of the performers dies in course of the exposition, special worship should be offered on his behalf.
viśeṣapūjanaṃ kuryātsamayebhyaśca niṣkṛtau | avikalpamaterna syuḥ prāyaścittāni yadyapi | tathāpyatattvavidvargānugrahāya tathā caret |	That needs also to be accomplished on the commission of any serious fault in course of transmission of the wisdom. Though there is no necessity of doing so for those who have got established in the wisdom, it should be done for the sake of the ignorant.
śrīpicau ca smṛtereva pāpaghnatve kathaṃ vibho | prāyaścittavidhiḥ prokta iti devyā pracodite | satyaṃ smaraṇameveha sakṛjjaptaṃ vimocayet | sarvasmātkarmaṇo jālātsmṛtitattvakalāvidaḥ tathāpi sthitirakṣārthaṃ kartavyaścodito vidhiḥ |	-a In the Picu śāstra it has been recorded how in course of Her conversation with Siva, the goddess Pārvati inquired of the Lord as to the relevance of observation of the memorial. Being inquired like this, the Lord told Her that though it is true that a single remembrance is sufficient to redeem the person concerned yet the knowers of the secret of it hold the view that sustenance of the tradition of observation of memorials is also a necessity in the midst of the net of all and sundry duties of life.
atattvavedino ye hi caryāmātraikaniṣṭhitāḥ | teṣāṃ daulāyite citte jñānahāniḥ prajāyate | |	- Tantrāloka On the concentration of those who are ignorant of the secret of things having been diverted, there is loss on the side of knowledge.
tasmādvikalparahitaḥ saṃvṛtyuparato yadi | śāstracaryāsadāyattaiḥ saṅkaraṃ tadvivarjayet | | saṅkaraṃ vā samanvicchetprāyaścittaṃ samācaret | yathā teṣāṃ na śāstrārthe dolārūḍhā matirbhavet |	Therefore, those who have become self-absorbed need to avoid this kind of mixing up the right and the wrong via recourse to discussion on canons of Šāstras. Alternatively, he who enters into the polemics of debate needs to take resort to atonement so as to avoid the danger of his drifting away from his faith in the canons of behaviour as propounded in the Sāstras.
yatsvayaṃ śivahastākhye vidhau saṃcoditaṃ purā | śataṃ japtvāsya cāstrasya mucyate strīvadhādṛte |	As has already been observed, by muttering the particular mantra known as Sivahasta one hundred times, the person concerned may get rid of any crime except for that of killing of his wife or a woman.
śaktināśānmahādoṣo narakaṃ śāśvataṃ priye | iti śrīratnamālāyāṃ samayollaṅghane kṛte | kulajānāṃ samākhyātā niṣkṛtirduṣṭakartarī | śrīpūrve samayānāṃ tu śodhanāyoditaṃ yathā |	It has been observed in the text known as Ratnamālā in the deliberation between Lord Śiva and Pārvati that woman stands for power on whose destruction the killer is destined to be dashed down for ever to the hell since he has transgressed the code of conduct of ethics. It has also been pointed out there in that text that the punishment for killing women born of honourable families is to meet the edge of the axe known as dusta kartari, killer of the criminal, as has been indicated as the form of the punishment of those who have violated the code of conduct of the system.
mālinī mātṛkā vāpi japyā lakṣatrayāntakam | pratiṣṭhitasya tūrāderdarśane'nadhikāriṇā | |	established in a temple without being authorised for it, the atonement is muttering of the mālini and mātrkā order of the alphabet up to three lakh times i.e. three hundred thousand times.
prāyaścitaṃ prakartavyamiti śrībrahmayāmale | brahmaghno gurutalpastho vīradravyaharastathā | devadravyahṛdākāra prahartā liṅgabhedakaḥ | nityādilopakṛdbhraṣṭasvakamātrāparicchadaḥ | śaktivyaṅgatvakṛdyogijñānihantā vilopakaḥ | naimittikānāṃ lakṣādikramād dviguṇaṃ japet |	-a Killer of a knower of the Reality, sleeper on the bed of his teacher, the person involved in the stealing of objects belonging to a heroic person, and any temple, thief or breaker of any emblem, transgressor of the codes of conduct, deviator from the code of conduct, given to concealment of the quantum of his crime, misrepresenter of power, killer of yogins and wise persons, destroyer of the tradition of incidental norms of behaviour are required to mutter the mantras beginning from one lakh times getting doubled at each step.
vratena kenacidyukto mitabhugbrahmacaryavān | dūtīparigrahe'nyatra gataścetkāmamohitaḥ |	He is required to take a certain vow, eat in the measured quantity and observe celibacy. If anyone happens to indulge inadvertently in sex out of lust with a female messenger dūtī, accomplished yogini, he, too, is required to mutter the mantra.
lakṣajāpaṃ tataḥ kuryādityuktaṃ brahmāmale |	This has been stated in the Brahmayāmala Tantra.
dīkṣābhiṣekanaimittavidhyante gurupūjanam | | aparedyuḥ sadā kāryaṃ siddhayogīśvarīmate | pūrvoktalakṣaṇopetaḥ kavistrikasatattvavit |	b- Tantrāloka Following the bath of initiation and performance of the incidental rites should be accomplished worship of the teacher. This is to be performed immediately on the next day according to the direction of the Siddhayogiśvari Tantra. The teacher chosen for worship needs to be such as should be transparent in his wisdom and knower of the essential principles of the Trika System.
sa guruḥ sarvadā grāhyastyaktvānyaṃ tatsthitaṃ tvapi | maṇḍale svastikaṃ kṛtvā tatra haimādikāsanam | |	He should be chosen out of even those who may be present there. b-a Inside the circle should be created a symbol of swastika followed by placement of the seat of the teacher decorated with gold.
kṛtvārcayeta tatrasthamadhvānaṃ sakalāntakam tato vijñapayedbhaktyā tadadhiṣṭhitaye gurum |	After this the six paths of the discipline need to be worshipped. Then the disciple needs to request the teacher to take his seat there.
sa tatra pūjya svairmantraiḥ puṣpadhūpārghavistaraiḥ | samālambhanasadvastrairnaivedyaistarpaṇaiḥ kramāt | āśāntaṃ pūjayitvainaṃ dakṣiṇābhiryajecchiśuḥ | sarvasvamasmai saṃdadyādātmānamapi bhāvitaḥ |	He needs to be worshipped there on the seat with particular mantras imparted to the disciple by himself along with the offering of flower, incense and other objects of worship including that of sacrifice clothes, things dedicated and gratificatory. Having worshipped him to his full contentment and through sacrificial donations, the pupil should place all his belongings including himself at his disposal.
atoṣayitvā tu guruṃ dakṣiṇābhiḥ samantataḥ | tattvajño'pyṛṇabandhena tena yātyadhikāritām |	Without gratifying the teacher in all respects, the disciple, even though having become the knower of the Reality remains indebted to him and short of the state of redemption.
gurupūjāmakurvāṇaḥ śataṃ janmāni jāyate | adhikārī tato mukti yātīti skandayāmale | |	Being shorn of the worship of the teacher, the disciple has to be born and reborn hundreds of times before getting redeemed, so observes the Skandayāmala Tantra.
tasmādavaśvaṃ dātavyā gurave dakṣiṇā punaḥ | pūrvaṃ hi yāgāṅgatayā proktaṃ tattuṣṭaye tvidam | |	Therefore, the sacrificial donation needs to be offered to the teacher again. This is so because whatever offerings were made to him earlier were offered by way of a part of the sacrifice while this one is by way of his satisfaction.
tajjuṣṭamatha tasyājñāṃ prāpyāśnīyātsvayaṃ śiśuḥ | tataḥ prapūjayeccakraṃ yathāvibhavasambhavam |	Having fed the teacher to his full contentment the disciple should take the remainder himself by his permission. This is to be followed by the worship of the cakra in keeping with his capacity to afford for.
akṛtvā guruyāgaṃ tu kṛtamapyakṛtaṃ yataḥ | tasmātprayatnataḥ kāryo guruyāgo yathābalam | | atatrastho'pi hi guruḥ pūjya saṃkalpya pūrvavat | taddravyaṃ devatākṛtye kuryādbhaktajaneṣvatha |	Since without performing the teacher-related sacrifice, all whatever performed earlier remains incomplete, therefore, it is necessary to perform this sacrifice deliberately to one's capacity. In the absence of the teacher on that occasion, the teacher needs to be offered the same worship imaginatively supposing as if he were present there, followed by distribution of materials of offering amongst devotees.
parvapavitraprabhṛtiprabhedi naimittikaṃ tvidaṃ karma | atha samucitādhikāriṇa uddiśya rahasya uccate'tra vidhiḥ | atha sarvāpyupāseyaṃ kulaprakriyayocyate | tathā dhārādhirūḍheṣu guruśiṣyeṣu yocitā | uktaṃ ca parameśena sāratvaṃ kramapūjane |	Tantrāloka Here comes to its close the entire ambit of this chapter of incidental performance beginning from sanctification of it and ending with its explanation. CHAPTER C Secret of Kula System Now is being explained the secret of the system known as the Kula system, targeting aspirants who are worthy of it. This entire system of worship is known as Kula as it has been developed through the chain of teacher and taught in the form of continuous stream and has been characterised by the Lord as the essence of the worship known as Krama order.
siddhakramaniyuktasya māsenaikena yadbhavet | na tadvarṣasahastraiḥ syānmatraughairvividhairiti |	- One who gets engaged in this system of worship developed and perfected by accomplished practitioners may attain perfection well within a month which may not be possible in course of even in a thousand of years' practice via a lot of mantras of different kinds.
kulaṃ ca parameśasya śakti sāmarthyamūrdhvatā | svātantryamojo vīryaṃ ca piṇḍa saṃviccharīrakama |	Tantrāloka Kula is the elevating force of the Supreme Lord with His autonomy as a power behind it and His virility as the consciousness embodied.
tathātvena samastāni bhāvajātāni paśyataḥ | dhvastaśaṅkāsamūhasya yāgastādṛśa eva saḥ |	Seeing of every event and object in the universe as an interplay of Śiva and Sakti in the process of eventuation and objectification as an act of sacrifice is destined to bring to an end all congregations of doubts.
tādṛgrūpanirūḍhyarthaṃ manovākkāyavartmanā | yadyatsamācaredvīra kulayāgaḥ sa sa smṛtaḥ |	For the sake of reaching that state of understanding whatever the vira one who is master of his senses, a hero performs mentally, vocally and bodily that becomes Kula-yāga ceremonial offer to fire under this system of spiritual practice .
bahiḥ śaktau yāmale ca dehe prāṇapathe matau| iti ṣoḍhā kulejyā syātpratibhedaṃ vibhedinī |	This sacrifice goes on simultaneously along with its sub-varieties on the following six planes, namely, in external behaviour, display of force, conjunction of the male and the female, in regard to body, vital force, particularly in its movement along the susumnā nerve as well as ideation.
snānamaṇḍalakuṇḍādi ṣoḍhānyāsādi yanna | kiñcidatropayujyeta kṛtaṃ vā khaṇḍanāya no |	Bathing, creation of circle, digging of the pit, sixteen kinds of assignment, etc. as popular in Tantra are of little use here and even if performed by someone are not warded off.
ṣaṇmaṇḍalavinirmuktaṃ sarvāvaraṇavarjitam | jñānajñeyamayaṃ kaulaṃ prokta traiśirase mate |	Secret of Kula System In view of the Trisiras śāstra, Kula-yāga is free of the trouble of creation of six circles, as well as that of secrecy. It is confined purely within the ambit of knowledge and the object of knowledge.
atra yāge ca yadravyaṃ niṣiddhaṃ śāstrasantatau | tadeva yojayeddhīmānvāmāmṛtapariplutam |	In this sacrifice the same objects need to be offered to fire by the wise which are prohibited in the tradition of the śāstras having dipped it into wine.
śrībrahmayāmale'pyuktaṃ surā śivaraso bahiḥ | tāṃ vinā bhuktimuktī no piṣṭakṣaudraguḍastu sā |	In the Brahmayāmala Tantra also it has been observed that wine which is considered as intoxicant outwardly is, indeed, the essence of Siva without the aid of which there is neither the possibility of enjoyment nor of redemption.
strīnapuṃsakapuṃrūpā tu pūrvāparabhogadā | drākṣotthaṃ tu paraṃ tejo bhairavaṃ kalpanojjhitam |	Its use is enjoyable in the beginning as well as towards the end.

antaraṅgakrameṇaiva mukhyacakrasya pūjanam | yadevānandasandohi saṃvido hyantaraṅgakam | |	The main cakra is that which is effulgent with delight and serves as the tool of interiorisation of consciousness. All other cakras are just followers of it.

Secret of Kula System It is that intermediacy of states which is neither exclusively peaceful nor one of exclusive dynamism. It is rather that state of balance between rest and movement which is the root of creation and has been characterised as kaula.

rūpamuditaṃ parasparadhāmagataṃ śāntamātmagatameva | ubhayamapi vastutaḥ kila yāmalamiti tathoditaṃ śāntam|	Though both of them within themselves are perfectly at rest and yet when they confront each other they become stimulated, this happens in their conjugal state.
śaktistaducitāṃ sṛṣṭiṃ puṣṇāti no tadvān | śāntoditātmakobhayarūpaparāmarśasāmyayoge'pi |	Indeed, it is Śakti, and by no means the Lord of Śakti, which nourishes the creation as per her nature even in spite of having moved to the mixed state of stasis and dynamic is made possible through their concurrence.

Therefore, the teacher needs to stimulate his disciple towards it properly in the interest of the Kaula system of knowledge and wisdom.

lakṣaikīyaṃ svaśiṣyaṃ taṃ dīkṣayettādṛśi krame | rudraśaktyā tu taṃ prokṣya devābhyāśe niveśayet | bhujau tasya samālokya rudraśaktyā pradīpayet | tayaivāsyārpayetpuṣpaṃ karayorgandhadigdhayoḥ | |	- a Having bathed him by the force of Rudra, the teacher needs to take him towards the Lord.

Having thus been applied by yogin-teacher for the sake of nourishing the disciple, the force burns completely whatever else subsists in him as other than pure consciousness. - Having become purified in this way, the disciple gets the privilege of the descent of force on him in the void of his consciousness, life-breath, as well as on the exterior of his body.

niṣkalā punaruktistu nāsmabhyaṃ jātu rocate | ityevaṃ mantravidyādisvarūpamupavarṇitam | |	Thus have been elucidated the mantra-vidyā and things associated with it. b- CHAPTER Deliberation on Mandalas Now is being laid down the process of formation of the circles in brief.
tadardhayitvā madhyaprākpratīcīṣvaṅkayetpunaḥ | tato'pyardhattavardhārdhamānata pūrvapaścimau | |	For this first of all what is required to be done is to determine the direction, beginning with the east followed by marking it with a thread stretched properly from both the ends.
tanmadhye pātayetsūtraṃ dakṣiṇottarasiddhaye | yadi vā prākparāktulyasūtreṇottaradakṣiṇe |	Having divided the point of division into two equal parts the line should be marked at the point of division. So also needs to be done on the line drawn from east to west.
matakṣetrārdhamānena madhyāddikṣvaṅkayettataḥ | sūtrābhyāṃ digdvayotthābhyāṃ matsya syātpratikoṇaga | matsyeṣu vedā sūtrāṇītyevaṃ syāccaturasakam | ekasmātprabhṛti proktaṃ śatāntaṃ maṇḍalaṃ yata | |	- Taking right-angle turns from both the ends at equal distances from both the ends the rest of the two lines should be drawn to meet at the fourth right angle so that there may be formed in the middle the meeting point of a pair of fishes. The thread should be stretched again north-south as well as east-west from the middle points of the lines concerned to determine the centre of the square.
siddhātantre maṇḍalānāṃ śataṃ tatpīṭha ucyate | yattanmadhyagataṃ mukhyaṃ maṇḍalānāṃ trayaṃ smṛtam | |	Thus would get formed mouths of the fish on all the corners of the square. -a Thus a hundred of circles may be created out of only the centre of which would become the central seat pitha according to the Siddhā Tantra.
madhyaśūlaṃ tritriśūlaṃ navaśūlamiti sphuṭam | tatra śūlavidhānaṃ yaduktaṃ bhedairanantakaiḥ |	b-a From amongst all those circles three ones would be main, namely, madhyaśūla, tritrisula and the navaśūla. As regards the formation of the edge points śūla, let us speak of the root of it as per the system of its formation.
bhāgai ṣoḍaśabhi sarva tattatkṣetraṃ vibhājayet | brahmasūtradvayasyātha madhyaṃ brahmapadaṃ sphuṭam | | kṛtvāvadhiṃ tato lakṣyaṃ caturtha sūtramādita | tatastiryagvrajet sūtraṃ caturthaṃ tadanantare | | koṣṭhe cendudvayaṃ kuryādabarhirbhāgārdhabhāgataḥ | tayorlagnaṃ brahmasūtrāttṛtīye marmaṇi sthitam |	b-a Out of the total area of the square of four hands, one-third should be left out all around while the rest should be divided into sixteen. b-a Deliberation on Mandalas The point where the two measuring threads stretched from the middle point of the length and breadth would cross each other would obviously be the seat of the Brahman. Having determined that mid-point, another thread should be stretched out in a curved way from the beginning between the two so as to divide the entire area into two equal parts like a lunar orb.
kṛtvā pūrṇenduyugalaṃ vartayeta vicakṣaṇaḥ| brahmasūtrāgatāt ṣaṣṭhāt tiryagbhāgāttṛtīyake | kṛtvārdhakoṣṭhake sūtraṃ pūrṇacandrāgalambitam | bhramayedunmukhaṃ khaṇḍacandrayugvahnibhāgagam | | tiryagbhāgadvayaṃ tyaktvā khaṇḍendo paścimāttata | koṇaṃ yāvattathā syācca kuryāt khaṇḍaṃ bhramadvayam | |	b-a Due to touch of the thread on the middlemost point the bracketed part of the area would be divided into two inward facing parts of the circle on the point of the second hand of the total area. b- Having thus created the couple of full-moons, the wise teacher should take a turn from the sixth part of the thread towards the third one making it pass along the half of the bracketed one and again taking a turn towards the half-moon and the fire. - Having left out both the curved areas of the half-moons from the backside forming an angle there should be formed a couple of turns.
madhyaśṛṃge'tha kartavye tṛtīye ūrdhvakoṣṭhake | caturthārdhe ca candrārdhadvayamantarmukhaṃ bhavet | | | | tacca pūrṇendumekaṃ prāgvartitaṃ prāpnayādyathā | anyonyaganthiyogena baddhāratvaṃ prajāyate | |	So also happens in the case of the other half of the area. Similar is the mode of formation of the middle one of the peaks, too, in regard to the fourth half of the area giving rise to the formation of the couple of half-moons making them face each other inwardly. - Thus is made available one full moon united with each other getting connected mutually by means of intermixing spokes.
evaṃ dvitīyapārśve'sya khaṇḍendudvayavartanāt | madhyābhyāṃ gaṇḍikā śliṣṭā parābhyāmagato nayet | |	The same process would result in the formation of two half-moons on the second side also. The knot created between the two intermediate figures created would emerge towards the front.
avadhānena saṃgrāhyamācāryeṇohavedinā | bhavetpaścānmukho mantrī tasmiṃśca brahmasūtrake | |	On the base of the two parts would get stretched the second brahma thread. - The teacher entrusted with the task of formation of this part of the circle needs to be competent in it as also quite attentive while accomplishing it.
madhyaśṛṃga varjayitvā sarva pūrvodito vidhi | tato yadunmukhaṃ khaṇḍacandrayugmaṃ puroditam | | tato dvayena kartavyā gaṇḍikānta susaṃgatā | dvayenāgagasūtrābhyāṃ madhyaśṛṃgadvayaṃ bhavet | |	Excepting for the formation of the middle one of the peaks mode of formation of the rest has already been spoken of. -a Deliberation on Mandalas As has already been stated in regard to the two half-moons facing each other, the same ones need to be knit together properly as via interconnection between them by means of the protruding ends of the threads would get formed the intermediate couple of peaks.
adhobhāgavivṛddhayāsya padamaṃ vṛttacatuṣṭayam | tataścakraṃ ṣoḍaśāraṃ dvādaśāraṃ dvidhātha tat |	b- Following the formation of the trident the lower part of it would get enlarged and the lotus would become a squared comprising of twelve and sixteen petals on account of its division into two.
madhye kuleśvarīsthānaṃ vyoma vā tilakaṃ ca vā | padamaṃ vātha ṣaḍaraṃ vā viyadvādaśakaṃ ca vā | |	In the middle of the formation would be the seat of the goddess Kulesvari which would remain either blank or would be filled with points. The order of the figures would be first the lotus, then the hexagonal figure and then the twelve- sided blank.
tritriśūle'tra saptāre śliṣṭamātreṇa madhyata | padmānāmatha cakrāṇāṃ vyomnāṃ vā saptakaṃ bhavet |	In this seven-sided trident due to getting mixed up in the middle may get formed lotuses, circles and blank spots numbering as many as seven due to intermixing together or even separately.
miśritaṃ vātha saṃkīrṇa samāsasavyāsabhedata | tataḥ kṣetrārdhamānena kṣetraṃ tatrādhikaṃ kṣipet | |	-a Then to the other half of the area some more space may be added.
tatra daṇḍa smṛto bhāga ṣaḍarāmalasārakaḥ | sutīkṣṇāga suraktābha kṣaṇādāveśakāraka | |	That additional area would be used for the formation of the stalk with six knots, sharp-edged, dark red so as to result in immediate arousal of the sense of oneness with it.
yā sā kuṇḍalinī devī taraṃgākhyā mahormiṇī | sā ṣaḍaśreṇa kandākhye sthitā ṣaḍdevatātmikā | |	b- The goddess Kundalini which is like a mighty wave lies in the kanda in a hexagonal form embodying in it six deities.
| | aṣṭabhāgaiśca vistīrṇo dīrghaścāpi tadardhataḥ | tato dvārāṇi kāryāṇi citravartanayā kramāt | |	Therefore, doors should be formed in an area eight finger-ends long and four finger-ends wide and variegated in colour like a rectangle or square. Then the edge of it should be formed positively or inversely.
unmukhaṃ candrayugmaṃ vā bhaṅktvā kuryāccatuṣṭayam | kuṭilo madhyataḥ spaṣṭo'dhomukha pārśvagasthita | |	Or the half-moons facing each other should be divided into four clearly oblique in the middle facing downward and close to each other, odd ones facing upward while the even ones facing the knot.
uttāno'rdho'sama pūrṇa śliṣṭo granthigatastathā | candrasyetthaṃ dvādaśadhā vartanā amabhedinī | | antarbahirmukhatvena sā punardvividhā matā | tadbhedānmaṇḍalānāṃ syādasaṅkhyo bhedavistara | |	This division of the moon into twelve parts is considered as remover of the doubts. The division again is considered to be of two kinds inward and outward. -a Deliberation on Mandalas In view of this division of the circles, the former may become innumerable particularly in view of the seat, lanes, area outside it, throat, ears, cheeks, decoration, sub-decorations, gunas, lines, svastikas beginning from two to eight kinds, alternatives of being and non-being.
pīṭha vīthībahibhūmikaṇṭhakarṇakapolataḥ | śobhopaśobhāsaṃbhedāda guṇarekhāvikalpataḥ |	b- Colours should be applied to the figures as per the system of beautification. The colours recommended for this purpose are whitish-red sindūra, deep red, blackish red khatikā, black and shining white.
uttamāni rajāṃsīha devatātrayayogataḥ | parā candrasamaprakhyā raktā devī parāparā | |	These colours shining like the moon, Parāparā by the red while the Aparā by the terrific black on account of her association with the terrific Yogini.
dṛṣṭvaitanmaṇḍalaṃ devyaḥ sarvā nṛtyanti sarvadā | | anarcite'pyadīkṣeṇa dṛṣṭe dīkṣyeta mātṛbhiḥ | kiṃvātibahunoktena tritriśūlārasaptakā | |	-a The entire scenario of the circle needs to be prepared in such an impressive way that all the goddesses may begin dancing by all means and without having used it for any kind of worship any novice may get initiated to Saivism by the motherly goddess by just having a look at it.
śūlayāgā ṣaṭ sahasāṇyevaṃ sārdhaśatadvayam |	b-a Needless to talk of the kinds of circles any more, the sacrifices related to it rise to six thousand and two hundred and fifty on account of the varieties created by the sevenfold arrangement of the three tridents.
yā sā devī parā śakti prāṇavāhā vyavasthitā | viśvānta kuṇḍalākārā sā sākṣādatra vartitā | tattvāni tattvadevyaśca viśvamasminpratiṣṭhitam | |	b-a In this circle lies represented the Supreme Goddess as the Force which serves as the impulse for breathing as the entire creation taking Her seat actually here in a circular pose along with the factors of the Reality and their presiding deities.
atrordhve tantumātreṇa tisa śūlāragā sthitā | āsanatvena cecchādyā bhogamokṣaprasādhikā |	b- Herefrom upward are extended three spokes as thin as threads serving as seats of willing, knowing and doing recommendatory of enjoyment as well as liberation.
tāstu mokṣaikakāmasya śūlārāviddhamadhyakā | tasmādenaṃ mahāyāgaṃ mahāvibhavastiraiḥ | |	Out of these spokes, the middle one is meant especially for those who are aspirants of only liberation. Therefore, this great sacrifice should be performed with due decorum and sense of worship by wise aspirants of both enjoyment and liberation.
palāyante daśa diśa śiva sākṣātprasīdati | | mandaśaktibalāviddho'pyetanmaṇḍalapūjanāt | | satataṃ māsaṣaṭkena trikajñānaṃ samaśnute | yatprāpya heyopādeyaṃ svayameva vicārya sa |	Having had just a look at it evil agencies such as spirits of the dead, vetālas and guhayakas run away in different directions and prove delightful to Siva. Through the worship of this circle even a medium category of aspirant becomes well-versed in the understanding of the Trika philosophy well within Deliberation on Mandalas six months, if he be regular in his effort.
dehānte syādabhairavātmā siddhikāmo'tha siddhayati |	Equipped with his understanding he comes up to the state of exercising his discrimination in selecting what doctrine is to be accepted and what to be left out and following the time of his death he becomes a Bhairava or a Siddha if he be an aspirant of it.
maṇḍalasyāsya yo vyāptiṃ devatānyāsameva ca | | vartanā ca vijānāti sa gurustrikaśāsane | tasya pādarajo mūrdhni dhārya śivasamīhinā | |	-a He who understands the extent of pervasiveness of this circle and the range of deities assigned to it as well as the system of its formation and worship, he becomes a teacher of it as worthy as the dust of his feet gets so sanctified as to be touched by the forehead.
atra sṛṣṭisthitidhvaṃsān kramāt trīnapi pūjayet | tarya tu madhyato yadvā sarveṣu paripūrakam | |	In such a circle, creation, sustenance and dissolution all three states of the world may be worshipped including even the fourth state of it at the middle point of it as complementary of all.
catustriśūlaṃ vā guptadaṇḍaṃ yāgaṃ samācaret | tatra tat pūjayetsamyak sphuṭaṃ kramacatuṣṭayam | |	b- In view of the availability of the fourth state of consciousness through the worship of the circle a fourth crest in the trident may be conceived in the form of a secret extension needing to be worshipped at the top of all on occasions relevant to it.
ityetatkathitaṃ gupte ṣaḍardhahṛdaye pare | ṣaṭke proktaṃ sūcitaṃ śrīsiddhayogīśvarīmate | |	This has been stated in some secret, Sāstras as such Sadardhahrdaya and Satka besides the Siddhayogiśvari Tantra also.
agata sūtrayitvā tu maṇḍalaṃ sarvakāmadam | mahāśūlasamopetaṃ padamacakrādibhūṣitam |	Śrī Tantrāloka Mandala should be drawn at the front of houses along with the trident, lotus, circle, etc. as it fulfils all aspirations.
dvāre dvāre likhecchūlaṃ varjayitvā tu paścimam | koṇeṣvapi ca vā kārya mahāśūlaṃ dumānvitam | |	It should be drawn from door to door except for the back side of them. On corners also it may be drawn in the form of the trident and the divine tree known as kalpa-vrksa.
amṛtāmbhobhavārīṇāṃ śūlāge tu trikaṃ trikam | śūlaṃ itthaṃ prakartavyamaṣṭadhā tat tridhāpi vā | |	- The figures of the moon, lotus and trident all these three objects need to be drawn as a group in eight or three ways together.
eva saṃsūcitaṃ divyaṃ khecarīṇāṃ puraṃ tviti | sthānāntare'pi kathitaṃ śrīsiddhātantraśāsane |	This would be indicative of the heavenly nature of the abode. This has been mentioned elsewhere in the Siddhātantra also.
kajaṃ madhye tadardhena śūlaśṛṃgāṇi tāni tu | śūlāṅka maṇḍalaṃ kalpyaṃ kamalākaṃ ca pūraṇe | |	In the middle should be drawn the figure of a lotus while on the sides of it should be drawn those of the spear and the peak. The spear needs to be circular while the lotus would be complementary to it.
atha śūlābjavinyāsa śrīpūrve triśiromate | siddhātantre trikakule devyāyāmalamālayo| | yathoktaḥ sāraśāstre ca tantrasadabhāvaguhyayoḥ | tathā pradarśyate spaṣṭaṃ yadyapyuktakramādgata | |	- Drawing of the spear and the lotus together has been mentioned in the Mālinivijayottara Tantra, Trisiro Bhairava śāstra, Siddhā Tantra, Trika śāstra, Kulasāstra, Devyāyāmala Tantra, Yāmalamala Tantra, Sāraśāstra, Tantrasadbhāvaśāstra and Guhyarahasaśāstra, etc. almost in the similar way, even then, however, I am mentioning these texts for the sake of clarification of the details.
vedāśrite histe prāka pūrvamadhaṃ vibhājayet | hastārdha sarvatastyaktvā pūrvodagyāmyadiggatam | | tryaṅgulai koṣṭhakairūrdhvestiryak cāṣṭadvidhātmakaiḥ | dvau dvau bhāgau parityajya punardakṣiṇasaumyagau|	- Deliberation on Mandalas Taking three hands' area from the square of four hands, also after deducting from the same half a hand's area all around from the east, north and south, three finger-ends squares should be drawn so as to create thirty-two squares.

tasyādita udātaṃ tatkathitaṃ padavedinā |	-a Thus this consciousness is just like an oblation put into the fire of pronunciation.

prasiddhimanusandhāya saiva cāgama ucyate | anvayavyatirekau hi prasiddherupajīvakau | |	It is on account of this factor that it has been characterised as āgama, tradition. -a Inclusion and exclusion are the criteria of prevalence of any principle.
svāyattattve tayorvyaktipūge kiṃ syāttayorgatiḥ | pratyakṣamapi netrātmadīpārthādiviśeṣajam |	These criteria are obvious from one's own experiences and not to talk of the collective experience. b-a Even perception is dependent on the eyesight, the consciousness of the perceiver as well as presence of the object to be perceived.
apekṣate tatra mūle prasiddhiṃ tāṃ tathātmikām |	And yet it needs to have its root in its traditional admittance.
abhitaḥ saṃvṛte jāta ekākī kṣudhita śiśuḥ | | |	b-a Take, for instance the case of a newly born child lying in a room enclosed with all kinds of objects. It is all alone and is hungry.

na pratyakṣānumānādibāhyamānaprasādajaḥ| prāgvāsanopajīvyetat pratibhāmātrameva | | na mṛdabhyavahārecchā puṃso bālasya jāyate | prāgvāsanopajīvī cedvimarśa sā ca vāsanā | |	b- It is important to note that the choice of the child of the inner being for a certain object in such a case is determined by the impression of its some prior experience, vāsanā. -a Dependence of the choice of the child on some prior experience is by means determined by its immediate insight, pratibhā. For instance natural propensity of the child for eating clay cannot be considered as spontaneous.
prācyā cedāgatā seyaṃ prasiddhiḥ paurvakālikī| naca cetaprasattyaiva sarvo vyavahṛtikrama | |	a-a If contemplation be based on some prior experience, it ought to have its source in prior actuality. b-a Concordance of All Scriptural Provisions Each and every pattern of behaviour is not dependent on immediate judgement.
pūrvapūrvopajīvitvamārgaṇe sā kvacitsvayam | |	If actuality of behaviour be determined by prior experience, it ought to be applicable equally well everywhere.

bhogāpavargatadvetuprasiddhaśataśobhita | tadvimarśasvabhāvo'sau bhairava parameśvara | |	b-a Since Lord Bhairava has hundreds of instances to support His agency in this regard concerned with enjoyment as well as redemption, He needs to be contemplated as that source.

Having travelled along the route of admittance by scriptures alternatively, it is ought to be accepted as the basis of all patterns of behaviour in this society. Since all patterns of behaviour on this earth beginning from early childhood are based on this fact which has been approved of fundamentally by the Saiva system of philosophy, anyone else is sure to be incomplete and therefore needs to be considered as inadequate to lead to redemption.
apūrṇāstu pare tena na mokṣaphalabhāgina | upajīvanti yāvattu tāvattatphalabhāginaḥ| | |	Those who follow them, deserve to reap the fruit of their following as per that limitation.

There does not remain any scope for any kind of mistake nor for doubt in the case of the self-proved, which remains beyond the range of condemnability, depend as it does on the capacity of being expressed in words.
mātu svabhāvo yattasyāṃ śaṅkate naiṣa jātucit | svakṛtatvavaśādeva sarvavitsa hi śaṃkara | |	Since the self-proved depends on the very nature of the self, it does not leave any scope for doubt in it. As it is self-formed, it is omniscient and prone to be self-satisfying.
yāvattuṃ śivatā nāsya tāvatsvātmānusāriṇīm | tāvatīmeva tāmeṣa prasiddhiṃ nābhiśaṅkate| | | |	Concordance of All Scriptural Provisions So far as its dependence remains on Siva, it continues to remain being followed by the Self as also inadmissible to doubt.
anyasyāmabhiśaṅkī syāt bhūyastāṃ bahu manyate | evaṃ bhāvaśivatvo'mūṃ prasiddhiṃ manyate dhruvam | |	Wherever there is the scope for intervention of anyone else, the follower takes it for granted. On account of the probability of attaining Siva-hood through it, the individual takes it for granted.
eka evāgamaścāyaṃ vibhunā sarvadarśinā | darśito ya pravṛtte ca nivṛtte ca pathi sthita | | dharmārthakāmamokṣeṣu pūrṇāpūrṇādibhedataḥ | vicitreṣu phaleṣveka upāyaṃ śāmbhavāgama|	- It is only the śaiva tradition as inspired by the all-seeing Lord which leads people to both the path liberation as well as enjoyment. No matter whatever be the objective, whether standard of conduct of life, earnings of livelihood, procreation or liberation, whether completely or partially irrespective of all these peculiarities, if there is any satisfactory mode of conduct; that is only the Saiva.
tasminviṣayavaiviktyādvicitraphaladāyini | citropāyopadeśo'pi na virodhāvaho bhavet | |	Although here also there is variety in the subjects of the matter provided for, yielding different kinds of results through different ways of acquisition, yet there is no self-contradiction amongst them.

yathaikatrāpi vedādau tattadāśramagāmina | saṃskārāntaramatrāpi tathā liṅgoddhṛtādikam | |	- Consequently, as there are various doctrines, prescribed in Vedic and related systems for the sake of people of different stages of life, even so is here, too, in regard to evolving the ideal of emblems of Śiva-hood from within oneself.
yathāca tatra pūrvasminnaśrame nottarāśramāt | phalameti tathā pāñcarātrādau na śivātmatām | |	As any result of an earlier stage of life does not get transferred to a later stage, even so Siva-hood does not get transferred to Pāñcarātra, etc.
eka evāgamastasmāttatra laukikaśāstra | prabhṛtyāvaiṣṇavāddbauddhācchaivātsarvaṃ hi niṣṭhitam | |	There is one tradition, under which get accommodated all traditions beginning from the practical commonsense up to Vaisnavism, Buddhism, etc. and that is the Saiva alone.
tasya yattat paraṃ prāpyaṃ dhāma tat trikaśabditam | sarvāvibhedānucchedāt tadeva kulamucyate | |	The supreme objective of Saivism is attainment of oneness amongst the three factors, namely, the individual, the universal and the Transcendent which has been expressed by the word trika, trinity in its own peculiar sense without harming anyone of them anyway. This is the sense intended behind the use of the word kula, all-inclusive, for it.
yathordhvādharatābhaksu dehāṅgeṣu vibhediṣu | ekaṃ prāṇitamevaṃ syāt trikaṃ sarveṣu śāstrataḥ | |	It is used in the same sense in which irrespective of the locational disparity between the head and the sole, the entire body is regarded as an organic whole on account of being stimulated by one and the same life- force. So is the prevalence of the idea of trinity behind all traditions.
śrīmatkālīkule coktaṃ pañcasotovivarjitam | daśāṣṭādaśabhedasya sārametaprakīrtitam | | puṣpe gandhastile tailaṃ dehe jīvo jale'mṛtam | yathā tathaiva śāstrāṇāṃ kulamanta pratiṣṭhitam | |	- Concordance of All Scriptural Provisions All rational deliberation apart, it has also been stated in the Sāstra known as Kālikula that the common essential factor behind all the eighteen kinds of traditions of divergent origins underlies them is the idea of kula, integrality in the same ways as good fragrance throughout the entire flower, oil throughout the sesame seed, tila, life-force throughout the body, even so the idea of organic unity pervades all the scriptures of the traditions.
tadeka evāgamo'yaṃ citraścitre'dhikāriṇi | tathaiva sā prasiddhirhi svayūthyaparayūthyagā |	- Saivism is such a tradition which though one differs in shades as per its practicability by followers of different range of ability. So is its publicity in keeping with the difference between those who are insiders of it and those who are outsiders.
sāṃkhyaṃ yogaṃ pāñcarātraṃ vedāṃścaiva na nindayet | yata śivodbhavā sarva iti svacchandaśāsane | |	According to the Svaccanda Tantra, Sānkhya, Yoga, Pāñcarātra and the Vedas all have their common root in Siva and therefore they need not be condemned.
ekasmādāgamaccaite khaṇḍakhaṇḍā vyapoddhṛtāḥ | loke syurāgamāstaiśca jano bhrāmyati mohitaḥ | |	- These various traditions have emerged from one and the same common one and have been accepted as such in the commonsense of the society in parts which keep different sets of people wandering among them having got confused.
anekāgamapakṣe'pi vācyā viṣayabheditā | avaśyamūrdhvādharatāsthityā prāmāṇyasiddhaye |	In the case of admittance of several traditions, it is necessary to define their difference of topic and position of each in relationship to the rest in regard to its higher and lower value for the sake of determining its validity.
anyathā naiva kasyāpi prāmāṇyaṃ siddhayati dhruvam | nityatvamavisaṃvāda iti no mānakāraṇam | |	In the absence of such a definition and determination, no one would be held as valid decidedly. Neither the criterion of durability would suffice in such a situation nor that of absence of consistency.
asminnaṃśe'pyamuṣyaiva prāmāṇyaṃ syāttathoditeḥ| anyathāvyākṛtau klṛptāvasatyatve prarocane | | atiprasaṃga sarvasyāpyāgamasyāpabādhakaḥ | avaśyopetya ityasminmāna āgamanāmani | |	- Even acceptance of both these criteria goes to prove the validity of Śaivism itself. Acceptance of any other criteria such as explanation of a particular tradition in a different way would involve acceptance of the validity on account of false fabrication or just appreciation. In such a case, this criterion would falsely extend to other traditions also and thus would suffer from imprecision.
avaśyopetyamevaitacchāstraniṣṭhānirūpaṇam | pradhāne'ge kṛto yanaḥ phalavānvastuto yata | |	-a Acceptance of any tradition as decidedly practicable may, therefore, be taken as its ultimate feature supportive of faith in it. If effort were to be put on its main contention that may be most likely to bear fruit.
etāvatyadhikāro yaḥ sa durlabha iti sphuṭam | itthaṃ śrīśambhunāthena mamoktaṃ śāstramelanam | |	Acceptance of such a tradition is possible on account of instigation of Sambhu himself which is obviously a matter of very rare opportunity. Thus, it is Śrī Sambhunātha who has associated me with such a valid tradition.
āyātiratha śāstrasya kathyate'vasarāgatā | śrīsiddhādivinirdiṣṭā gurubhiśca nirūpitā | bhairavo bhairavī devī svacchando lākulo'ṇurāda | |	b- F CHAPTER P Tradition of Saivism Tantras like Siddha have indicated and my teachers have explained how the text of the Saiva system had been authored by Bhairava and Bhairavi and studied by Svacchanda, Lākula, Anurāt, Gahaneśa, Brahmā, Sakra and Brhaspati in a descending order by a crore of verses at each level which originally comprised nine crores of verses at each stage of transmission from the predecessor to his successor.
gahaneśo'bjaja śakro guru koṭyapakarṣata | navabhi kramaśo'dhītaṃ navakoṭipravistaram | |	- Out of nine crores of verses when only one crore remained by way of study at the stage of Brhaspati, the same were divided into four.
etaistato guru koṭimātrāt pādaṃ vitīrṇavān | dakṣādibhya ubhau pādau saṃvartādibhya eva ca | |	Out of one-fourth of those verses, one-fourth was transmitted to seer Vāmana, etc.
pādaṃ ca vāmanādibhya pādādhaṃ bhārgavaya ca | pādapādaṃ tu valaye pādapādastu yo'paraḥ | |	and half to Bhārgava, half of it to Vali, half of it to Simha, and one-fourth of the same to Garuda, the son of Vinatā and one-fourth of the rest to Vāsuki, the serpent.
siṃhāyādhaṃ tataḥ śiṣṭādvau bhāgau vinatābhuve | pādaṃ vāsukināgāya khaṇḍā saptadaśa tvamī | |	Thus, until now the original number passed through as many as seventeen stages of reduction.
svargādadhaṃ rāvaṇo'tha jahe rāmo'rdhamapyataḥ | vibhīṣaṇamukhādāpa guruśiṣyavidhikramāt |	Half of the remainder was brought to the earth from the heaven by Rāvana Out of the same, half was imparted to Bibhisana by Rāvaņa Out of the same, half was imparted to Rāma by Bibhisana by way of transmission from the teacher to the taught.
khaṇḍerekānnaviṃśatyā vibhaktaṃ tadabhūttata | khaṇḍaṃ khaṇḍaṃ cāṣṭakhaṇḍaṃ proktaṃpādādibhedataḥ | |	Thus, the total number got divided as many as nineteen times. In this transmission it got divided eight times from the total by way of remainder of the half and one-fourth.
pādo mūloddhārāvuttaravṛhaduttare tathā kalpa | sāṃhitakalpaskandāvanuttaraṃ vyāpakaṃ tridhā tisa | |	- The denominations of division are one-fourth, pāda, the remainder, mula, uddhāra, uttara, vrhaduttara, kalpa samhitā and anuttara. The last stage is comprehensive.
devyo'tra nirūpyante kramaśo vistāriṇaiva rūpaiṇa | navame pade tu gaṇanā na kāciduktā vyavacchidāhīne | |	The deities of these numbers are elucidated throughenlargement of the number. At the ninth stage, the exact number has not been mentioned following which there is no division.
rāmāccalakṣmaṇastasmāt siddhāstebhyo'pi dānavā | guhyakāśca tatastebhyo yogino nṛvarāstata | |	- Tradition of śaivism From Rāma the wisdom was passed on to Laksmana, from Laksmana it got transmitted to Siddhas, from Siddhas to Dānavas, from Dānavas to Guhyakas, from Guhyakas it was passed on to yogins and then to kings.
teṣāṃ krameṇa tanmadhye bhraṣṭaṃ kālāntarādyavā | tadā śrīkaṇṭhanāthājñāvaśāt siddhā avātaran | | tryambakāmardakābhikhyaśrīnāthā advaye dvaye | dvayādvaye ca nipuṇā krameṇa śivaśāsane | |	In course of passage from one to another when it got corrupted, the Siddhas got incarnated by the permission of Śrikantha Siva . From amongst these Siddhas, Tryambaka rejuvenated the non-dualism, Srinātha the dualism in non-dualism and Amardaka the dualism under the discipline of Śaivism. - While the tradition of Tryambaka remained continued and that of Amardaka did via his daughter.
ataścārdhacataso'tra maṭhikā saṃtatikramāt | śiṣyapraśiṣyairvistīrṇā śataśākhaṃ vyavasthitaiḥ | | |	Therefore, the tradition of him is known as half the Tryambaka. Thus, three and a half tradition accrued out of Tryambaka via as many schools and inheritance and got diversified into hundreds of branches via the continuity of disciples from one stage to another.
adhyuṣṭasaṃtatisotasārabhūtarasāhṛtim | vidhāya tantrāloko'yaṃ syandate sakalānrasān | | uktāyātirupādeyabhāvo nirṇīyate'dhunā | uktanītyaiva sarvatra vyavahāre pravartite | prasiddhāvupajīvyāyāmavaśyagāhya āgama | |	- This work, namely, Tantrāloka is flowing like a stream of sweet water having been filled with the essence of all these traditions. Now, it embodies in its exposition finally the quintessence of all these streams of wisdom in its all-comprehending sweep and hence deserves acceptance as such. CHAPTER Conclusion and Deliberation If the standard of behaviour as expounded in the foregoing chapters is acceptable practically in life, this tradition of wisdom needs to be practised upon.
yathā laukikadṛṣṭayānyaphalabhāk tatprasiddhitaḥ | samyagvyavaharaṃstadvacchivabhāk tatprasiddhita |	As, from the worldly viewpoint, any standard of behaviour gets approved of owing to its approval since long as such, even so is the possibility of Śaivite wisdom due to its time-tested antiquity.
tadavaśyagahītavye śāstre svāṃśāpadeśini | mānakaphale'bhyupādeyatamaṃ tadviparītakam | |	If anyone takes up any tradition for practice, he is sure to accept it as a whole. If, however, it proves to be capable of bearing only partial result, he has to go against its acceptability.
yathā khageśvarībhāvani śaṅkatvādviṣaṃ vrajet | kṣayaṃ karmasthitistadvadaśaṅkāda bhairavatvata | |	As it happens on taking resort to the Gārudi Vidyā that the patient of snake- bite becomes sure of getting free of the danger of the poison, so is the case with recourse to Bhairava in regard to the removal of the effect of action.
yadārṣe pātahetūktaṃ tadasminvāmaśāsane | āśusiddhayai yataḥ sarvamārṣa māyodarasthitam |	What has been characterised in the Vedic tradition as a cause of downfall on account of its leading to the womb of delusion, the same proves effective in fulfillment.
tacca yatsarvasarvajñadṛṣṭaṃ taccāpi kiṃ bhavet | yadaśeṣopadeśena sūyate'nuttaraṃ phalam | | yathādharādharaproktavastutattvānuvādata | uttaraṃ kathitaṃ saṃvitsiddhaṃ taddhi tathā bhavet | |	This is so on account of the Saiva tradition having been envisaged by Śiva who is omniscient, as is evident from His following leading to unique results. As against instructions imparted by lesser traditions proves to be effective from statements in admiration of it by anyone else, the effect of following Saiva tradition is realised by practitioner himself directly.
yaduktādhikasaṃvittisiddhavastunirūpaṇāt | apūrṇasarvavitproktirjñāyate'dharaśāsane |	As compared to the source of higher tradition in higher self-consciousness, the lower traditions have their source in lesser self-consciousness.
ūrdhvaśāsanavastvaṃśe dṛṣṭvāpica samujjhite | adhaḥ śāstreṣu māyātvaṃ lakṣyate sargarakṣaṇāt | |	Conclusion and Deliberation While in the higher tradition the lust for life in the world is rejected even having got it fulfilled, in the lower traditions the same becomes stuck to which obviously is indicative of its having been delusory.
śrīmadānandaśāstrādau proktaṃ ca parameśinā | ṛṣivākyaṃ bahukleśamadhuvālpaphalaṃ mitam | |	It has been observed by Lord Śiva Himself in scriptures like Ananda Śāstra that the instructions imparted by seers involve great distress and yet yield unstable and limited result having been followed.
naiva pramāṇayedvidvān śaivamevāgamaṃ śrayet | yadārṣe pātahetūktaṃ tadasmit vāmaśāsane |	As such, they do not deserve to be approved of by the wise and in place of them it becomes imperative to take resort to Saiva tradition itself.
āśusiddhayai yata sarvamārṣa māyodarasthitam |	-a What has been regarded in the Vedic tradition as a cause of downfall on account of its leading to the womb of delusion, the same proves effective in quick fulfillment in Saivism.
yathā khageśvarībhāvaniśaṅkatvādviṣaṃ vrajet | | kṣayaṃ karmasthititastadvadaśaṅkābhairavatvataḥ | ajñatvānupadeṣṭṛtvasaṃdaṣṭe'dharaśāsane | |	b-a This is so on account of the Saiva tradition having been envisaged by Siva Himself who is omniscient as is evident from following the Saiva tradition leading to unique results. b-a Due to its root in ignorance and lack of instructions the lower tradition is like a snake-bite, contrary to which is the position of the Saiva tradition. Therefore, it needs to be accepted for practice.
etadviparyayād grāhyamavaśyaṃ śivaśāsanam | dvāvāptau tatra ca śrīmacchrīkaṇṭhalakuleśvarau|	There are two ultimate authorities behind it, namely, Srikantha and Lakuleśvara. Thus this tradition is a confluence of two streams and hence has the prospect to lead to the ultimate end.
tacca pañcavidhaṃ proktaṃ śaktivaicitryacitritam | pañcasota iti proktaṃ śrīmachrīkaṇṭhaśāsanam | |	Out of these the older one by virtue of its scope of offering redemption as well as enjoyment, gets diversified into five streams, namely, the stream of consciousness, the spring of delight, dominance of will, dominance of knowledge and dominance of action.
daśāṣṭādaśadhā sota pañcakaṃ yattato'pyalam | utkṛṣṭaṃ bhairavābhikhyaṃ catuḥṣaṣṭivibheditam | |	Therefore, it has been characterised as one of five streams. This stream again gets diversified into eighteen. Therefore, it is the best of all moreover on account of its diversification into sixty-four streams ultimately.
śrīmadānandaśāstrādau proktaṃ bhagavatā kila | samūha pīṭhametañca dvidhā dakṣiṇavāmataḥ| mantro vidyeti tasmācca mudrāmaṇḍalagaṃ dvayam | mananatrāṇadaṃ yattu mantrākhyaṃ tatra vidyayā | |	b- It has been stated in texts like Ānanda Śāstra, etc. by Lord Bhairava Himself that this tradition is combined form of two streams, namely, the right and the left Mantra and Vidyā, Mudrā and Mandala are their additional features. - a That which is meant for contemplation and is capable of extension of the life-force, is mantra while vidyā is that which gets its support from as well as Conclusion and Deliberation fulfilment in mantra.
upodvalanamāpyāya sā hi vedyārthabhāsinī | mantrapratikṛtirmudrā tadāpyāyanakārakam | |	The latter get its object reflected in mantra Mudrā is the image of mantra as well as complementary to leading it to fulfilment.
maṇḍalaṃ sāramuktaṃ hi maṇḍaśrutyā śivāyam | evamanyonyasaṃbhedavṛtti pīṭhacatuṣṭayam | | | yatastasmādabhavetsarva pīṭhaṃ pīṭhe'pi vastuta |	Mandala is the decoration as well as essence of Śiva. Since all these four aspects of the seat are complementary of one another and therefore form its varieties. b-a It is on account of dominance of the element concerned that they get differentiated from one another.
pradhānatvāttasya tasya vastuno bhinnatā puna | |	The differentiation is stated for the sake of according importance to the form concerned.
kathitā sādhakendrāṇāṃ tattadvastuprasiddhaye | pratyekaṃ taccaturdhaivaṃ maṇḍalaṃ mudrikā tathā | |	Each one of these aspects of the system is diversified into four and out of mandala, mudrikā, mantra and vidyā each latter one is higher in status than the its predecessor.
mantro vidyeti ca pīṭhamutkṛṣṭaṃ cottarottam | vidyāpīṭhapradhānaṃ ca siddhayogīśvarīmatam | | | tasyāpi paramaṃ sāraṃ mālinīvijayottaram | uktaṃ śrīralamālāmetacca parameśitā | |	b-a The Siddhayogiśvari viewpoint has pre-eminence of vidyā in its while the Mālinivijayottara Tantra is the ultimate essence of it. b-a It has been stated by Lord Śiva Himself in Ratnamālā that the entire essence of Tantra in its left and right both the aspects combined form the trika system known as kaula. The Siddhānta Tantra has predominance of action in it.
ba |	Therefore, it talks of the malady caused by delusion of action and atomicism.
siddhānte karma bahulaṃ malamāyādirūṣitam | dakṣiṇaṃ raudrakarmādayaṃ vāmaṃ siddhisamākulam | |	As such, Sri Tantrāloka it is considered as the right aspect of Tantra while the left one is dominated by terrific undertakings and is replete with the possibilities of fulfilment of desires.
svalpapuṇyaṃ bahukleśaṃ svapratītivivarjitam | mokṣavidyāvihīnaṃ ca vinayaṃ tyaja dūrataḥ | |	The left side of Tantra suffers from scarcity of virtue, is troublesome in its undertaking and shorn of self-confidence as well rid of the possibility of redemption. Therefore, it needs to be abstained from a distance.
yasminkāle ca guruṇā nirvikalpaṃ prakāśitam | muktastenaiva kālena yantraṃ tiṣṭhati kevalam | | |	b- The disciple gets liberated at the same moment the teacher imparts to him redemptive Light of Consciousness. Thence onwards only his body continues to operate as a machine.
mayaitatsotasāṃ rūpamanuttarapadāda dhruvāt | ārabhya vistareṇoktaṃ mālinīślokavārtike | |	The source of these streams of ideas right from the eternal state of transcendent reality has been exposed in detail in the text titled Māliniślokavārtika.
jijñāsustata evedamavadhārayituṃ kṣama | vaya tūktānuvacanamaphalaṃ nādriyāmahe | |	One who is desirous of understanding the same may be capable of learning about it from that source itself. As regards starting the same ideas again, we do not entertain any desire for reaping the fruit of repetition.
| | itthaṃ dadadanāyāsājjīvanmuktimahāphalam | yathepsitamahābhogadātṛtvena vyavasthitam | |	Having received those ideas from that source the reader certainly gets the great result of life in the form of enjoyment as well as redemption immediately.
ṣaḍardhasāraṃ sacchāstramupādeyamidaṃ sphuṭam | ṣatriṃśatā tattvabalena sūtā yadyapyanantā bhuvanāvalīyam | brahmāṇḍamatyantamanoharaṃ tu vaicitryavarja nahi ramyabhāva | |	That text embodies the quintessence of the entire scripture of such a system which is realistic and hence deserves to be taken up for practice in life. -a Conclusion and Deliberation Though this group of creation known as the egg of Brahman and thirty-six constituent components is infinite and attractive yet except for peculiarities there is nothing enjoyable in it.
bhūrādisaptapurapūrṇatame'pi tasminn manye dvitīyabhuvanaṃ bhavanaṃ sukhasya | kvānyatra citragatisūryaśaśāṅkaśobhi rātrindivaprasarabhogavibhāgabhūṣā | | tatrāpica tridivabhogamahārghavarṣa dvīpāntarādadhikameva kumārikām | yatrādharādharapadātparamaṃ śivānta māroḍhumapyadhikṛti kṛtināmanarghā|	Though it is adorned by seven planes of being such as bhūh, etc., I think ours is unique source of enjoyment. Where there is any state of being where the sun and the moon adorn the day and the night with their peculiar movements and turn it into the resort of enjoyment. b- There also exists the Kumārikā dvipa with its excellence amongst the other parts of the world by virtue of having all the objects of enjoyment of heavenly value in it where also beginning from the lower to lowest and ending unto Siva anyone has the privilege of ascension to excellence.
prākkarmabhogipaśatocitabhogabhājā kiṃ janmanā nanu sukhaikapade'pi dhāmni | sarvo hi bhāvini paraṃ paritoṣameti saṃbhāvite natu nimeṣiṇi vartamāne | |	What is the use of being reborn in the world which is the abode of those who suffer the consequences of their actions of prior lives in comparison to the house of unmixed delight. This is so because people generally expect satisfaction from the future possibilities of delightful experience instead of remaining contented with the present status itself.

eṣāṃ grāhyo viṣaya sūkṣma pravibhāgavarjito ya syāt | tanmātrapañcakaṃ tat śabda sparśo maho rūpo raso gandhaḥ | etatsaṃsargavaśāt sthūlo viṣayastu bhūtapañcakatām | abhyeti nabha pavanasteja salilaṃ ca pṛthvī ca | |	Of these sense organs are the objects subtle and unseparated from their substantive elements, that is, the tanmātras, namely, sound, touch, form, taste and smell respectively. Through the intermixture of these subtle elements, undiversified as they are, is produced the group of five gross elements named as space, air, fire, water and earth.
tuṣa iva taṇḍulakaṇikāmāvṛṇute prakṛtipūrvaka sarga | pṛthvīparyanto'yaṃ caitanyaṃ dehabhāvena | |	Just as the husk covers from all around the grain of rice, even so the entire group of emerging elements from Prakrti up to the earth covers the consciousness as its body.
paramāvaraṇaṃ mala iha sūkṣmaṃ māyādi kañcukaṃ sthūlam | bāhyaṃ vigraharūpaṃ kośatrayaveṣṭito hyātmā | |	The final covering is formed by the malas, impurities, including māyā and the rest while the outer one is formed by the gross body as the three sheaths around the ātman, Self.
ajñānatimirayogādekamapi svaṃ svabhāvamātmānam | grāhyagāhakanānāvaicitryeṇāvabudvīyate |	ātman as one's own nature, though only one, is understood diversely as the object and the subject due to being affected by the darkness of ignorance.
rasaphāṇitaśarkarikāguḍakhaṇḍādyā yathekṣurasa eva | tadvavasthābhedā sarve paramātmana śambho | |	Just as squash, molasses, sugar, guda jaggery , khanda, etc., are the forms of the juice of sugarcane itself, even so the different states of the ātman are all the statuses of the Lord Śiva.
vijñānāntaryāmiprāṇavirāidehajātipiṇḍāntā | vyavahāramātrametat paramārthena tu na santyeva | |	The divisive stream of awareness, the all-pervading consciousness, vital force, generation, gross bodies, etc., are matters of sheer practical use and not real.
rajjvāṃ nāsti bhujaṃgastrāsaṃ kurute ca mṛtyuparyantam | bhrāntermahatī śaktirna vivektuṃ śakyate nāma | |	Parmārthasāra The snake is not there in the place of a rope at all and yet one remains afraid of it until one's death.
tadvad dharmādharmasvarranirayotpartimararṇasurkhaduḥkham | varṇāśramādi cātmānyasadapi vibhamabalāda bhavati | | |	So mighty is the force of delusion that it cannot be explained. Similarly righteousness and unrighteousness, heaven and hell, birth and death, pleasure and pain, castes and stages of life, etc., do not lie in the ātman and yet due to the power of delusion they are there.
etat tadandhakāraṃ yada bhāveṣu prakāśamānatayā | ātmānatirikteṣvapi bhavatyanātmābhimāno'yam | |	The darkness of delusion lies in the fact that all the beings are considered as different from the ātman though they are one with it, as they become obvious only in the psychic light of consciousness.
dehaprāṇavimarśanadhījñānanabhapraparccayogena | ātmānaṃ veṣṭyate citraṃ jālena jālakara iva | | svajñānavibhavabhāsanayogenodveṣṭayennijātmānam | iti bandhamokṣacitrāṃ krīḍāṃ pratanoti paramaśivaḥ |	It is an ignorance enwrapping another ignorance, like a big boil on the cheek, that there is projected the sense of ātman over the body and vital breath, etc. How surprising it is that like a silkworm the Self creates a covering around it comprising the gross body, the system of vitality,ideation, intellection, knowledge and experience of void! The Supreme Śiva may unveil Himself through the illumination of the abundance of His self-knowledge.
sṛṣṭisthitisaṃhārā jāgatsvapnau suṣuptamiti tasmin | bhānti turīye dhāmani tathāpi taināvṛtaṃ bhāti | | | |	Though the states of creation, sustenance and dissolution get revealed in the states of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep of the individual in the light of the fourth state of consciousness and yet they seem to be not concealed by these at all.
jāgadviśvaṃ bhedāt svapnasteja prakāśamāhātmyāt | prājñaḥ suptāvasthā jñānaghanatvāt tataḥ paraṃ turyam | |	The state of wakefulness is known as viśva on account of the awareness of the diversity in it. The state of dream is called tejas on account of the glory of illumination in it while the state of sound sleep is known as prājña on account of the density of self-understanding in it.
jaladharadhūmarajobhirmalinīkriyate yathā na gaganatalam | tadvanmāyāvikṛtibhiraparāmṛṣṭa para puruṣa | |	Just as the expanse of the sky does not get polluted by the cloud, smoke and dust likewise the Transcendent Purusa remains unaffected by the deformities of the force of creation, māyā.
ekasmin ghaṭagagane rajasā vyāpte bhavanti nānyāni | malināni tadvadete jīvā sukhadukhabhedajuṣa | |	When the space inside a particular jar becomes dusty, the others do not become so, similarly, all these individual selves do not become exactly so while undergoing the experiences of pleasure and pain differently.
śānte śānta ivāyaṃ hṛṣṭe dṛṣṭo vimohavati mūḍhaḥ | yadanātmanyapi tadrūpāvabhāsanaṃ tat purā nirākṛtya | ātmanyanātmarūpāṃ bhāntiṃ vilayati paramātmā | |	तत्त्वगणे सति भगवान् न पुनः परमार्थत: स तथा | | gdological TruthsParmārthasāra When these constituents of the covering become tranquil, satiated and deluded, He, too, appears to have become so but really it is not so. The Supreme Lord eradicates the delusion of not-self in place of the Self following the eradication of the sense of Self reflected even in the not-self.
itthaṃ vibhramayugalaka samūlavicchedane kṛtārthasya | kartavyāntarakalanā na jātu parayogino bhavati | | |	Having succeeded in eradicating this twin of delusion root and branch in this way a higher kind of yogin has nothing else to accomplish.
pṛthvī prakṛtirmāyā tritayamidaṃ vedyarūpatāpatitam | advaitabhāvanavalāda bhavati hi sanmātrapariśeṣam | |	The trinity of the objective world comprising the earth, its basic stuff of creation along with the principle of creativity gets reduced simply to the state of bare existence by the force of contemplation of the non-duality.
raśanākuṇḍalakaṭakaṃ bhedatyāgena dṛśyate yathā hema | tadvada bhedatyāge sanmātraṃ sarvamābhāti | | | |	Just as simply gold remains there to perceive after relinquishing the sense of forms like girdle, earring, bangle, etc., even so following the relinquishment of all the sense of difference, bare existence remains there to experience.
tad brahma paraṃ śuddhaṃ śāntamabhedātmakaṃ samaṃ sakalam | amṛtaṃ satyaṃ śaktau viśrāmyati bhāsvarūpāyām | |	That supreme, pure, tranquil, immortal and non-dual Brahman alone remains there in all its homogeneity and reality resting in its Force, Sakti, which is of the nature of an illumination of consciousness.
iṣyata iti vedyata iti sampādyata iti ca bhāsvarūpeṇa | aparāmṛṣṭaṃ yadapi tu nabha prasūnatvamabhyeti | | |	Whatever is desired, whatever is cognised, whatever is accomplished and whatever has remained unthought of is only in the form of illumination of consciousness without which it gets reduced into the sky-flower.
śaktitriśūlaparigamayogena samastamapi parameśe | śivanāmani paramārthe visṛjyate devadevena | |	It is through the agency of the Supreme Lord known as Śiva and accomplished by means of His triple weapon in the form of the forces of willing, knowing and doing that the world has got released.
punarapi ca pañcaśaktiprasaraṇakrameṇa bahirapi tat | aṇḍatrayaṃ vicitraṃ sṛṣṭaṃ bahirātmalābhena | |	Again in order to make Himself available outside as well, the Lord has Created the three spheres namely, Māyā, Prakrti and Prthivi through the process of projection of Himself via His five forces i.e., cit, ānanda, icchā, jñāna and kriyā, that is consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge and action respectively.
iti śakticakrayantraṃ krīḍāyogana vāhayan deva | ahameva śuddharūpa śaktimahācakranāyakapadastha | | |	The Lord making, thus, move onward playfully the wheel-like machine of forces remains Himself occupying the position of the pure mover of the great wheel of His forces in the capacity of 'I'.
mayyeva bhāti viśvaṃ darpaṇa iva nirmale ghaṭādīni | matta prasarati sarvaṃ svapnavicitratvamiva suptāt | |	“Within me appears the world like the jar, etc., in a taintless mirror. From me emerge everything like the various forms of dream from the dreamer”.

It is I who sparkles all as a lustre glittering within all beings." “I am the seer, the listener, the smeller and the doer, though I am bereft of a body and organs of sense and action both. It is I who authors the Siddhāntas, Agamas and treatises on reasoning of different varieties.
itthaṃ dvaitavikalpe galite pravilaṃghya mohanīṃ māyām | salile salilaṃ kṣīre kṣīramiva brahmaṇi layīsyāt |	" When all the dualities get dissolved in this way, and the deluding Māyā also gets transcended, one may become merged in Brahman like water in water and milk in milk.
| | itthaṃ tattvasamūhe bhāvanayā śivamayatvamabhiyāte | ka śoka ko moha sarva brahmāvalokayata | | |	In this way, following the transformation of the entire group of essential ingredients of the creation into Siva, what can remain as a source of sorrow and what that of delusion for one who observes Brahman alone everywhere.
karmaphalaṃ śubhamaśubhaṃ mithyājñānena saṃgamādeva | viṣamo hi saṃgadoṣastaskarayogo'pyataskarasyeva | | |	Fruits of actions both auspicious and inauspicious are due to delusion as well as association. The effect of association is indeed dangerous like the association of a honest man with a thief.
lokavyavahārakṛtāṃ ya ihāvidyāmupāsate mūḍhāḥ | te yānti janmamṛtyu dharmādharmārgalābaddhāḥ| | | |	Those deluded persons who take resort to the path of ignorance under the compulsion of worldly matters, have to move in the circle of birth and death bound by the chain of piety as well as sin.
ajñānakālanicitaṃ dharmādharmātmakaṃ tu karmāpi | cirasañcitamiva tūlaṃ naśyati vijñānadīptivaśāt |	Even the effects of actions both virtuous and vicious accumulated long sine during the time of delusion get burnt as a heap of cotton by the fire of correct understanding.
jñānaprāptau kṛtamapi na phalāya tato'sya janma katham | gatajanmabandhayogo bhāti śivārka svadīdhitibhiḥ | |	After getting the right knowledge, actions done by the doer, do not bear fruits and, therefore, how can there be the possibility of his rebirth? Getting rid of the bondage of rebirth, he shines as the sun of Sivahood by means of his own rays.
tuṣakambukakiṃśārukamuktaṃ bījaṃ yathāṅkuraṃ kurute | naiva tathāṇavamāyākarmavimukto bhavāṅkuraṃ hyātmā | |	Just as a grain of paddy having got rid of its husk, inner cover and sprout cannot germinate, even so this ātman cannot grow the sprout of the world if free of the impurities of atomisation, delusion and action.
ātmajño na kutaścana vibheti sarvaṃ hi tasya nijarūpam | naiva ca śocati yasmāt paramārthe nāśitā nāsti |	Parmārthasāra He, who is self-realised, has no sense of fear from anywhere since all becomes his own being. Nor does he meet grief anyway since there is no destruction in the state of the highest destination.
atigūḍhahṛdayagañjaprarūḍhaparamārtharatnasañcayataḥ | ahameveti maheśvarabhāve kā durgati kasya | | mokṣasya naiva kiñcid dhāmāsti na cāpi gamanamanyatra | ajñānaganthibhidā svaśaktyabhivyaktatā mokṣa |	On one having accumulated the gems emerging from the Supreme Reality in the extremely secret treasury of the heart, and thus has attained the state of experience ‘It is I myself who is the greatest Lord', where remains the risk of suffering and for whom ? There is no specific abode of the state of liberation nor does it involve movement anywhere else. Resolution of the knot of ignorance resulting in manifestation of one's own potency is liberation.
bhinnājñānaganthirgatasandeha parākṛtabhānti | prakṣīṇapuṇyapāpo vigahayoge'pyasau mukta | |	He who has resolved the knot of ignorance and has become redeemed of all doubts and has kept himself away from delusions and has got free of the sense of both virtue and sin, he becomes liberated in spite of continuing to remain alive.
agnyabhidagdhaṃ bījaṃ yathā prarohāsamarthatāmeti | jñānāgnidagdhamevaṃ karma na janmapradaṃ bhavati | | | parimitabuddhitvena hi karmocitabhāvidehabhāva | saṅkucitā citiretaddehadhvaṃse tathā bhavati | |	As a seed burnt in fire loses its potentiality to sprout, even so any action burnt in the fire of knowledge becomes incapable of leading to rebirth. Action done with a limited intellectual understanding leads to the moulding of the awareness to the idea of the body in keeping with its parameters. The contracted consciousness results in formation of the next body after the destruction of the present one in keeping with itself.
yadi punaramalaṃ bodhaṃ sarvasamuttīrṇabodadhṛkartṛmayam | vitatamanastamitoditabhārūpaṃ satyasaṅkalpam | | dikkālakalanavikalaṃ dhruvamavyayamīśvaraṃ suparipūrṇam | bahutaraśaktivrātapralayodayaviracanaikakartāram | | sṛṣṭyādividhisuvedhasamātmānaṃ śivamayaṃ vibuddhayeta | kathāmiva saṃsārī syāda vitatasya kutaḥ kva vā saraṇam | |	If, on the other hand, one were to get such understanding which be faultless, might have transcended the sense of knower behind the knowledge, be extensive enough to have crossed the limits of rising and setting and, as such, be of the form of sheer illumination and real in its power of determination, might have transcended the limitation of calculation of time and space, be constant, imperishable, and the Lord Himself perfectly complete in Himself, creator of multitudes of forces, of processes of dissolution and emergence, capable of directing the processes of various kinds of creation, etc., and hence have become Siva himself, for him worldliness would remain only a matter of tale.
iti yuktibhirapi siddhaṃ yat karma jñānino na saphalaṃ tat | na mamedamapi tu tasyeti dārdayato na hi phalaṃ loke | |	Where may be a particular place of resort for one which be all-pervading? - As such, by means of reasoning also it becomes established that an action done by a person of real knowledge does not bear results. 'It is not mine but of his' emanating from the case of the priest in relationship to the sacrificer, leads to the point of possibility of action without bearing any fruits in the world.
itthaṃ sakalavikalpān pratibuddho bhāvanāsamīraṇata | ātmajyotiṣi dīpte juhvajjyotirmayo bhavati | |	Through assessment of all such possibilities ignited in the air of his ideation and Parmārthasāra disposition and by making an offering of the same in the luminous fire of the Self, the awakened yogin becomes enlightened himself.
aśnan yadvā tadvā saṃvīto yena kenacicchānta | yatra kvacana nivāsī vimucyate sarvabhūtātmā | |	Irrespective of eating whatsoever, being clad in whatsoever form and living wheresoever, the yogin who has identified himself with the Self of all and has become tranquil, gets liberated.

madaharṣakopamanmathaviṣādabhayalobhamohaparivarjī | nistotravaṣaṭkāro jaḍa iva vicaredavādamati |	He may move at his sweet will like a fool without having to recite any prayers and making any offerings in the fire who has made himself free of intoxication, exaltation in joy, anger, indulgence in sex, sorrow, fear, greed, delusion, as well as inclination to discussion.
madaharṣaprabhṛtirayaṃ varga prabhavati vibhedasammohāt | advaitātmavibodhastena kathaṃ spṛśyatāṃ nāma | | stutyaṃ vā hotavyaṃ nāsti vyatiriktamasya kiñcana ca | stotrādinā sa tuṣyenmuktastannirnamaskṛtivaṣaṭka | | |	The group beginning from intoxication, exaltation in joy, etc., is born of the delusion of the sense of difference. How can then the experience of one's non- duality with the Self be touched by it? Since no one is there besides himself who may deserve his prayer or offerings, the liberated himself may get satisfied by prayers, etc., having got free of the necessity of praying and making offerings.
ṣaṭtriṃśattattvabhṛtaṃ vigaharacanāgavākṣaparipūrṇam | nijamanyadatha śarīraṃ ghaṭādi vā tasya devagṛham | |	For him, his own body or anyone else's may serve as a temple constructed out of thirty-six elements and equipped with outlets of the organs as windows. The same purpose may be served also by anything like pitcher, etc.
tatra ca paramātma mahābhairava śivadevatāṃ svaśaktiyutām | ātmāmarśana vimala dravyai paripūjayannāste |	He remains there worshipping the Lord great Bhairava as an auspicious deity along with His Self-Power through the use of self-contemplation as objects of pure offerings.
bahirantaraparikalpanabhedamahābījanicayamarpayata | tasyātidīptasaṃvijjvalane yatnādvinā bhavati homa | | |	He gets his ritual of offerings accomplished effortlessly by putting into the blazing fire of his pure consciousness the huge heap of seeds in the form of idea of diversity of internal and external objects.
dhyānamanastamitaṃ punareṣa hi bhagavān vicitrarūpāṇi | sṛjati tadeva dhyānaṃ saṅkalpālikhitasatyarūpatvam | |	Meditation is constancy of creativity through which the Lord releases out of Himself in the form of the world in all its peculiar variety and diversity.
bhuvanāvalīṃ samastāṃ tattvakramakalpanāmathākṣagaṇam | antarbodhe parivartayati yat so'sya japa udita |	Parmārthasāra Hisjapa constant repetition of a particular mantra is said to lie in returning again and again in his awareness to the rosary of creation consisting of fundamental elements, their order in the process of arrangement as also the group of beads representing them.
sarvaṃ samayā dṛṣṭyā yat paśyati yacca saṃvidaṃ manute | viśvaśmaśānaniratāṃ vigahakhaṭvāṅkalpanākalitām | viśvarasāsavapūrṇa nijakaragaṃ vedyakhaṇḍakakapālam | rasayati ca yattadetad vratamasya sudurlabhaṃ ca sulabhaṃ ca |	An accomplished pāśupata yogin looks towards all whatsoever from a viewpoint of equality and thinks about them accordingly as a heap of bones amassed together in the world as a cremation ground, his own body as a skeleton holding in hand a piece of skull, like a part of a broken jar, tasting from it the wine of the worldly experience and taking the same as his vow considerably difficult to observe and at the same time easy to think of.
iti janmanāśahīnaṃ paramārthamaheśvarākhyamupalabhya | upalabdhṛtāprakāśāt kṛtakṛtyastiṣṭhati yatheṣṭam | |	- Having, thus, attained the close proximity of Lord Maheśvara who is rid of the incidence of birth and death and serves as the highest goal of life and thus by virtue of revelation of the sense of attainment remains fulfilled and fully contented.
vyāpinamabhihitamitthaṃ sarvātmānaṃ vidhūtanānātvam | nirūpamaparamānandaṃ yo vetti sa tanmayo bhavati |	He becomes one with Him who knows Him as mentioned above as all-pervading, Self of all, shaker of all diversity, unique, and as sheer bliss.
tīrthe śvapacagṛhe vā naṣṭasmṛtirapi parityajan deham | jñānasamakālamukta kaivalyaṃ yāti hataśokaḥ | | puṇyāya tīrthasevā nirayāya kvapacasadananidhanagati | puṇyāpuṇyakalaṅkasparśābhāve tu kiṃ tena | | |	One who absorbs this kind of knowledge within himself, becomes free from sorrow and attains the state of liberation at the same time, irrespective of the fact whether he dies in a sacred place or in the house of a pariah and has lost all his memories. Dwelling in a sacred place results in the acquisition of piety while dying in the house of a pariah leads to the hell.
tuṣakambukasupṛthakakṛtataṇḍulakaṇatuṣadalāntarakṣepa | taṇḍulakaṇasya kurute na punastadrūpatādātmyam | | tadvat kañcukapaṭalī pṛthakakṛtā saṃvidatra saṃskārāt | tiṣṭhantyati muktātmā tatsparśavivarjitā bhavati | | | kuśalatamaśilpikalpitavimalībhāva samudgakopādheḥ| malino'pi maṇirūpādhervicchede svacchaparamārtha |	What do all these prospects and dangers mean to a person who has risen above the touch of both of them? If a grain of paddy were made cleared of the husk and the inner cover of it once, it cannot be restored to its original status howsoever covered by another husk and inner cover. Likewise, the I-consciousness being once separated from its covering of the kancukas, even if continuing to dwell here in the world by virtue of the samskāras of the past life, a liberated soul does not get affected by them. A gem having been cut and polished by even the ablest of the artists having been placed inside a case does not look bright until it is taken out of its covering but when taken out of the same, it shows its real shine.
evaṃ sadguruśāsanavimalasthiti vedanaṃ tanūpādhe | muktamapyupādhyantara śūnyamivābhāti śivarūpam |	Even so, an I-consciousness made rid of all the blemishes once as a result of the Parmārthasāra instructions of a worthy teacher becomes as brilliant as Siva Himself not being prone to assume another covering.
śāstrādiprāmāṇyādavicalitaśraddhayāpi tanmayatām | prāptaḥ sa eva pūrva svarga narakaṃ manuṣyatvam | |	The same I-sense previously attained heaven, hell and manhood as a result of having identified itself with those states owing to its unflinching faith in the validity of the scriptures and other sources of knowledge.
antya kṣaṇastu tasmin puṇyāṃ pāpāṃ ca vā sthitiṃ puṣyan | mūḍhānāṃ sahakārībhāvaṃ gacchati gatau tu na sa hetu | [ | |	It is the disposition of the last moment of life which determines whether one attains the state of virtue or sin; it is due to operation in accordance with this impression of the ignorant that one reaches such states of being whereas this disposition is not applicable in the case of a yogin.
ye'pi tadātmatvena viduḥ paśupakṣisarīsṛpādaya svagatim | te'pi purātanasambodhasaṃskṛtāstāṃ gatiṃ yānti | |	Those animals, birds, insects, etc., who understood their right state of things of the previous life, even they attain the same state of being equipped with the impressions of their previous lives.
svargamayo nirayamayastadayaṃ dehāntarālaga puruṣa | tadabhage svaucityād dehāntarayogamabhyeti | |	The soul embodying this body has the possibility of both the heaven and the hell within itself and is of the nature of departing from it and going to another one after the fall of it in keeping its suitability.
evaṃ jñānāvasare svātmā sakṛdasya yādṛgavabhāta | tādṛśa eva tadāsau na dehāpāte'nyathā bhavati | | |	In the same way, this Self becomes the same instantly as per its enlightenment on the occasion of getting the self-realisation instead of becoming otherwise on the fall of the body.
karaṇagaṇasampramoṣa samṛtināśa śvāsakalilatācchedaḥ| marmasu rujāviśeṣā śarīrasaṃskārajo bhoga | |	Stoppage of the functions of the organs, loss of memory, breakage in the creeper of the breath, special kind of pain on sensitive points of the body, all these are the fruition of the samskāras latent in it.
sa kathaṃ vigrahayoge sati na bhavet tena mohayoge'pi | maraṇāvasare jñānī na cyavate svātmaparamārthāt | |	How can these bodily symptoms not be manifest on the occasion of death till one remains embodied and continues to dwell associated with the state of delusion. The enlightened person, however, does not swerve from the highest and real nature of his Self.
paramārthamārgamenaṃ jhaṭiti yadā gurumukhāt samabhyeti | atitīvraśaktipātāt tadaiva nirvighnameva śivaḥ | | sarvottīrṇa rūpaṃ sopānapadakrameṇa saṃśrayata | paratattvarūḍhilābhe paryante śivamayībhāva | |	As soon as the aspirant comes to this path which leads to the supreme goal of life by virtue of words of initiation coming from the mouth of the spiritual instructor, he gets transformed into Siva through the extremely sharp transference of the force of consciousness. One who has taken resort to the stairway leading to the ultimate goal, attains Sivahood as a consequence of getting settled in his inner being the sense of his oneness with the Supreme Essence.
tasya tu paramārthamayīṃ dhārāmagatasya madhyaviśrānteḥ | tatpadalābhotsukacetaso'pi maraṇaṃ kadācit syāt | |	Parmārthasāra In the case of such an aspirant of yoga, it is likely to happen that he dies in the mid of the course of his journey without having reached his highest objective owing to an interval of rest meanwhile, though keen in his consciousness to attain it.
yogaaṣṭaḥ śāstre kathito'sau citrabhogabhuvanapati | viśrāntisthānavaśāda bhūtvā janmāntare śivībhavati | paramārthamārgamenaṃ hyabhyasyāprāpya yogamapi nāma | suralokabhogabhāgī muditamanā modate suciram | |	Known as yoga-bhrasta one who has fallen from the high path of yoga, that kind of aspirant on account of his taking rest in the middle of the path after his demise gets the privilege of becoming the owner of objects of various sorts of enjoyment with the prospect of attaining oneness with Śiva in the next birth. Having tread this path leading to the Supreme and yet having failed to attain oneness with Him, such an aspirant gets the privilege of enjoying the pleasures of the world of gods and remains there delightfully for long.
viṣayeṣu sārvabhauma sarvajanai pūjyate yathā rājā | bhuvaneṣu sarvadevairyogabhraṣṭastathā pūjya | |	As a sovereign king is respected by all the subjects in his empire, even so is honoured by all gods he who has fallen from the high path of yoga.
mahatā kālena punarmānuṣyaṃ prāpya yogamabhyasya | prāpnoti divyamamṛtaṃ yasmādāvartate na puna | |	Having been born as a human long after and having practised yoga, he attains the state of divine immortality from which no more does he come back.
tasmāt sanmārge'smin nirato yaḥ kaścideti sa śivatvam | iti matvā paramārthe yathā tathāpi prayatanīyam | |	Whosoever, therefore, remains busy treading this path, attains Śiva-hood. Having thought over this prospect , one needs to put in effort anyhow.
idamabhinavaguptoditasaṃkṣepaṃ dhyāyataḥ paraṃ brahma | acirādeva śivatvaṃ nijahṛdayāveśamabhyeti | |	An aspirant meditating on the Supreme Brahman as per the way discussed by Abhinavagupta briefly here attains the state of presence of Siva-hood well within his heart before long.

Dehastha-Devatā-Cakra-Stotram Hymn to The Human Body as a Temple of Divinities The human body has been characterised as a temple and the Self inside it as the eternal Deity which needs to be worshipped as one's own self after removing the heap of flowers of ignorance lying around it.

Whatever lies in my mind concerning you, O Lord, has been offered to your lotus-like feet with the sense of devotion. It is all whatever I know and there is nothing except for it which I understand O Sea of Compassion and Lord of the helpless, putting aside everything else, shower your pleasure on me as soon as possible.
maheśa tvadvāri sphuratu rucirā vāgatitarāṃ mamaiṣā nirdoṣaṃ jaya jaya maheśeti satatam | śivā saiṣā vāṇī bhavatu śivadā mahyamaniśaṃ maheśānāthaṃ māṃ śaraṇada sanāthaṃ kuru vibho |	On your door may this beautiful vāk, speech of mine sprout to full extent and unhindered always announcing your victory, O Great Lord.

You are not listening to my prayer addressed to you in various ways nor are you dawning on my inner being. You are not giving any support to me who lies fallen in the midst of the pit of the ocean of world. The Veda has truly described you as shorn of the vocal organ, eye, ear, feet and hands.
gurorvākyād yuktipracayaracanonmārjanavaśāt samāśvāsācchāstraṃ prati samucitādvāpi kathitam | vilīne śaṅkābhe hṛdayagaganodabhāsi mahasa prabho sūryasyeva spṛśatu caraṇān dhvāntajayina|	In spite of vanishing of the cloud of doubt by means of the effect of the teacher's instructions, besmearing of the inner being by means of composition replete with reasoning, confidence created by going through śāstras, scriptural writings and thus in spite of the psychic space having been illuminated by the light, may my inner being come into contact with your feet like the rays of the sun victorious on darkness.
yātastvatsahavāsato bahutara kālo vatāsmin kṣaṇe kiṃ kiṃ vā na kṛtaṃ tvayā varagurūpāsānimittena me | vāraṃ vāramahaṃ punarnirūpamāṃ divyaṃ bhuvaṃ prāsuva tkāyastvāṃ kila vismarāmi yadata stheyaṃ na bhūyastvayā |	By the present moment considerably long duration of time has been elapsed in your company. What favour have you not done to me by offering to me the opportunity of being in the proximity of excellent teachers ? I have assumed bodies again and again of unique and brilliant nature. Even then I fail to remember you.
tathyātathyamakalpamalpaśayanairjalpakramaṃ saṃharaṃ statsaṃhārakrame na kiṃ kathamidaṃ ko'smīti mācīklṛpaḥ | bhāvābhāvavibhāgabhāsakatayā yadabhātyabhagnakramaṃ tacchūnyaṃ śivadhāma vastuparamaṃ brahmātra ko'rthagraha | | | | yadyatattvaparihārapūrvakaṃ tattvameṣi yadatattvameva hi | yadyatattvamatha tattvameva vā tattvameva nanu tattva mīdṛśam |	Paramādvayadvādaśikā Deliberating on what is real and what is unreal to what extent? Keeping awake almost all the time except for a short while and having withdrawn and in the process of withdrawal what how who am I? Do not spend your time and energy in this way. What appears as being and rid of being continuously that is the void of the abode of Śiva, the highest state of being, Brahman Itself? What is the use of all these deliberations? Having removed the unreal what you reach at as essential that also is unessential. Whatever is unessential, that, too, is essential and real. This is the nature of Reality. Whatever appears is by no means different from sheer appearance.
yadyadabhāti na bhānata pṛthagidaṃ bhedo'pi bhātīti ceda bhāne so'pi nabhāti kiṃjahitatastadbhaṅgibhaṅgagaham | svapne svapnatayā prathāṃ gatavati krīḍaiva no bhītikṛt śāstraghāta jalāvapāta hutabhunirghāta bandhādikam | |	In spite of appearing so, the Real does never appear.
dhyānakriyākalanapūrvakamadhyasyeda yadyadabhavān kathaya ko'sya jaḍādviśeṣa | sphūrjañjaḍo'pi na kimadvayabodhadhāma nissīmanityaniravagrahasatyarūpam |	Does it imply rejection of the appearance ? On subsidence of the effect of dream, all whatever was horrific, such as getting hurt by weapon, falling into water, burning in fire, getting bound, etc. turns into a sheer play. In course of meditation, the meditator needs to determine what is his difference from the inconscient is.
bhāvānāmavabhāsako'si yadi tairmālinyamātanyate kiṃ te tadyadi bhāti hanta bhavatastatrāpyakhaṇḍaṃ mahaḥ | no cennāsti tadevamapyubhayathā nirvyājaniryantraṇā truṭyadvibhamanityatṛptimahimā nityaprabuddho'si bhoḥ | | | | dṛṣṭiṃ bahi prahiṇu lakṣyamathāntaritthaṃ syādabhairavānukaraṇaṃ bata vañcaneyam | nirdvandvabodhagaganasya na bāhyamasti nābhyantaraṃ niravakāśavikāsadhāmna |	While bearing out flutter, does the inconscient not show that it, too, is the abode of awakening boundless, eternal, unobstructed and hence real? If you are thinking that you are the illuminator of whatever is existing; this kind of thinking only expands your misery. What would concern you if it is appearing i as such automatically? Indeed, it would amount to being due to your own intact glory. If it is not owing to your own glory, let it be so as thinking of it in both the ways is a sheer bondage on you. Paramādvayadvādasikā Extend your eyesight outside and your aim inside. This would be an imitation of Bhairava.
vāsanāprasaravibhramodaye yadyadullasati tattadīkṣyatām | ādimadhyanidhaneṣu tatra cedabhāsi bhāsi tava līyate'khilam | |	Keep looking at whatever is emerging out of expansion of vāsanā, impressions lying pent up in the mind. Whatever is appearing to you in the beginning, in the middle and at the end; that is purely only your own illumination in face of which gets subsided your own entire limitation.
moho dukhavitarkatarkaṇaghano hetuprathānantara prodyadvibhamaśṛṅkhalātibahalo gandharvapūssannibha | dvaitādvetavikalpanāśrayapade cidvayomni nābhāti cet kutrānyatra cakāstu kāstu paramā niṣṭhāpyanekātmanā | svapne tāvadasatyameva maraṇaṃ sauṣumnadhāmniprathā naivāsyāsti taduttare nirupadhau cidvayomni ko'sya grahaḥ | jagatyeva ghaṭāvabhāsavadatha syāccetkṣaṇe kutraci dāropyāpi tadatyaye pṛthagidaṃ tatrāpi kā khaṇḍanā | |	Delusion is the cloud of suffering, reasoning and counter-reasoning going on in all its abundance. It is like the city of Gandharvas. If it were not to arise in the domain of space of consciousness which is the resort of the contemplation on dualism and non-dualism, where else would it have to arise which indeed is the standpoint of the unity and diversity both? The incident of death in the state of dream is just an illusory appearance of the state of sound sleep. Nor does it hold good in the higher fourth state of spiritual state of pure consciousness of the jar in the waking state where at the end of that state, the appearance happens to be experienced as such.
ye ye ke'pi prakāśā mayi sati paramavyomni labdhāvakāśā kvāśāmeteṣu yadye mahimani mayi bho nirvibhāgaṃ vibhānti | nirvyājanityapratihatakalanānantasatyasvatantra sohaṃ dhvastadvaitādvayādi dvayamayatimirāpārabodhaprakāśa | |	We cannot expect much from illuminations unfolding themselves incidentally in course of spiritual practice as they reappear in their integrality in the state of oneness with the Supreme Being in which the dichotomy of duality and non- duality gets dissolved in the real sense of integrality on removal of the darkness of ignorance in the light of the highest truth.
kāla saṃkalayan kalā kālayatu saṣṣṭā sṛjatvādarāda ājñāyāḥ paratantratāmupagato mathyanātu vā manmatha | krīḍāḍambaramambarāśrayamiva sve lekharekhākramaṃ dehādyāśrayamastu vaikṛtimahāmoho na paśyāmi kim | |	May time play its role in putting together pieces of events and objects as the creator with all regard it is capable of, may the god of love under the imperative of his Lord churn the mind as he wills, may the tendency of embodiment continue to draw its design as per its will, I, however, do not look towards these spectacle of delusion, howsoever magnified they may be.
kaḥ ko'tra bho'haṃ kavalīkaromi kaḥ kaḥ ko'tra bho'haṃ sahasāniḍanmi | ko'tra bho'haṃ parabodhadhāma sañcarvaṇonmattatanu pibāmi | |	Paramādvayadvādaśikā I snug up all whosoever there may be. I sink forcibly all whosoever there may be. I drink all whosoever there may be under the spell of having got entry into the abode of the supramental consciousness.
bhavotthabhayabhagadaṃ gadaśṛgālavidrāvaṇaṃ prabodhadhuridhīmatāmapi sadyaduddīpayan | svadhāmagahanāṭavīviharaṇātitṛptyudramāda vibhedaharibṛṃhitaṃ vyadhita ramyadevo hara| |	Śiva is the remover of the fear of going astray in worldliness. He drives away the jackal of disease. He is the immediate illuminator of even those wise people who have reached the centre of awareness of the Truth. He is fully contented due to having moved at His sweet will through the dense forest of His abode. It is He who has brought fascination to the world expanded by Visņu as different from Himself.
paramādvayadvādaśikā sampūrṇā | prakāśamātraṃ yatproktaṃ bhairavīyaṃ paraṃ mahaḥ | tatra svatantratāmātramadhikaṃ pravivicyate |	Bimbapratibimbavādah Talk About the View of Reflection The glory of Bhairava is said to be pure light. Over and above that, He is also absolutely autonomous. Here is a deliberation on the same aspect of Him.
yaḥ prakāśaḥ sa viśvasya prakāśatvaṃ prayacchati | na ca tadvyatirekyasti viśvaṃ sadvā'vabhāsate |	The light of Śiva illuminates the world which is no way different from Him which appears as existence.
ato'sau parameśāna svātmavyomanyanargalaḥ | iyata sṛṣṭisaṃhārāḍambarasya pravartakaḥ |	He is the Supreme Lord as He moves absolutely by Himself in the space of the Self. He is the agent of creation as well as dissolution of the entire expanse of the world.
nirmale mukure yadvabhānti bhūmijalādaya | amiśrāstadvadekasmiścinnāthe viśvavṛttayaḥ |	As earth, water, etc. get reflected in a clean mirror without getting mixed up with them any way, even so do all the curvatures of consciousness concerning the world.
sadṛśaṃ bhāti nayanadarpaṇāmbaravāriṣu | tathāhi nirmale rūpe rūpamevāvabhāsate |	Kindred are the reflection of objects in the eye, mirror, space and water, so is the case with forms in anything clean.
pracchannarāgiṇīkāntapratibimbitasundaram | darpaṇaṃ kucakumbhābhyāṃ spṛśannapi na tṛpyati |	A beloved in secret love with her lover even getting his touch with her jar-like breast as reflected beautifully in a mirror, does by no means get satisfied as would have been in the case of the actual touch.
na hi sparśo'sya vimalo rūpameva tathā yata | vaimalyaṃ cātinibiḍamajātīyaikasaṅgati | |	In case of the reflection only form bears cleanliness and by no means touch also as cleanliness lies in exclusive density of the ingredient of the spectacle.
svasminnabhedādabhinnasya darśanakṣamataiva yā | atyaktasvaprakāśasya nairmalyaṃ tadgurūditam | | nairmalyaṃ mukhyametasya saṃvinnāthasya sarvataḥ | aṃśāṃśikāta kvāpyanyadvimalaṃ tattadicchayā |	My teachers have explained to me that purity lies in the capacity to see an object with the sense of one's oneness with it without any loss of the luminosity of the self. Bimbapratibimbavādah It is purity of the Lord of consciousness which is operative everywhere somewhere partially and at the rest exclusively as per His wish.
bhāvānāṃ yatpratīghāti vapurmāyātmake hi tat | teṣāmevāsti sadvidyāmayaṃ tvapratighātakam | |	Where entities react against each other, there is involvement of illusory body. As against it, where there is absence of reaction, that is the abode of true knowledge.
tadevamubhayākāramavabhāsaṃ prakāśayan | vibhāti varado bimbapratibimbatayā'khile | |	Illuminating the both kinds of appearance, the blessed presence of Śiva lies there having assumed the status of the original entity and its reflection all over the world.
yastvāha netratejāṃsi svacchātpratiphalantyalm | viparyasya svakaṃ vaktraṃ gṛhṇantīti sa pṛcchyate | |	Some hold the view that it is illuminations of the eyesight which get reflected back due to their cleanliness in the form of the reflection of the face. This view is questionable.
dehādanyatra yattejastadadhiṣṭhāturātmanaḥ | tenaiva tejasā jñatve kortha syāddarpaṇena tu | | | viparyastaistu tejobhirgāhakātmatvamāgataiḥ| rūpaṃ dṛśyeta vadane nije na mukurāntare | |	It is the illumination of the reflection as different from the body which belongs to its source itself. If the same proves to be the object of knowledge, what would be the use of the mirror? There is a view that in case of reflection returning from the reflector to the source of reflection, it ought to be possible for seeing the reflection of one's face on the face itself.
svamukhe sparśavaccaitadrūpaṃ bhāyānmametyalam | na tvasya spṛśyabhinnasya vedyaikāntasvarūpiṇaḥ | |	In that case, the person concerned ought to feel on one's face itself the touch that this face is mine and by no means as different from what is to be touched which alone is to be understood as the object of understanding.
rūpasaṃsthānamātraṃ tat sparśagandharasādibhiḥ | nyagbhataireva tadyuktaṃ vastu tatpratibimbitam | |	The fact is that it is the form alone rid of touch, smell, taste, etc. which gets reflected in the mirror.
nyagbhāvo grāhyatābhāvāt tadabhāvo'pramāṇata | sa cārthasagamābhāvāt so'pyādarśe'navasthite | | | |	The attribute of ‘getting rid of’ amounts to insensibility as insensibility amounts to lack of validity while the lack of validity depends on absence of contact between the sense of touch and the object touched. This is why weight, etc.
tasmāttu naiṣa bhedena yada bhāti tata ucyate | ādhārastatra rūpāyā dīpaṭṭaksaṃvidaḥ kramāt | |	This is because sensibilities other than sheer form do not get reflected in the mirror, it being a means of reflecting only form. This is why what appears in the mirror does not appear as different from the face.
dīpacakṣurvibodhānāṃ kāṭhinyābhāvata param | sarvataścāpi nairmalyānna vibhādarśavatpṛthak | |	Bimbapratibimbavādah Since there is absolute absence of hardness in the flame of the lamp and the eye, except for cleanliness in all respects, what gets reflected in them appears no way as different from the source of reflection as it does in the case of mirror.
etacca devadevena darśitaṃ bodhavṛddhaye | mūḍhānāṃ vastu bhavati tato'pyanyatra nāpyalam | |	This has been elucidated by Lord Śiva for the sake of enhancing the degree of understanding in the mind of the ignorant that the reflection is an entity but no way different from the object which is its source.
pratīghāti svatantraṃ no na sthāyyasthāyi cāpi na | svacchasyaivātha kasyāpi mahimeti kṛpālunā | |	The merciful Lord has suggested that unlike the object, the reflection lacks in counter action as it is neither independent nor stable nor even unstable.
na deśo no rūpaṃ na ca samayayogo na parimā na cānyonyāsaṅgo na ca tadapahānirna dhaṭanā | na cāvastutvaṃ syānna ca kimapi sāraṃ nijamiti dhruvaṃ moha śāmyediti niradiśaddarpaṇavidhim | |	Reflection has neither space nor form nor association with any particular time nor even weight. It is not attached with its source. It is neither absolutely independent of its source nor an event. It ought not to be nothingness nor have any substance of its own. It is sheer delusion.
anastamitabhārūpastejasāṃ tamasāmapi | ya eko'ntaryadantaśca tejāṃsi ca tamāṃsi ca | | sa eva sarvabhāvānāṃ svabhāva parameśvara | bhāvajātaṃ hi tasyaiva śaktiryeśvaratāmayī | |	Bodhapañcadasika Fifteen Verses on Consciousness He who in the form of illumination obtains within luminaries as well as darkness, remains eternally awakened, is one, indwells all and forms in their inmost secret, is the real nature of all whatever is in existence, and is the Supreme Lord possessed of all power of rulership I bow to Him.
śaktiśca śaktimadūpāda vyatirekaṃ na vāñchati | tādātmyamanayornityaṃ vahanidāhatayoriva | |	- Force of anything does never remain separate from its resort. Force and forceful always obtain as one and the same like the fire and its heat.
sa eva bhairavo devo jagabharaṇalakṣaṇa | svātmādarśa samagaṃ hi yacchaktyā pratibimbitam | |	He is the same Lord Bhairava called so on account of providing for the sustenance of the world getting reflected in the mirror of His own Self by virtue of His own Force.
tasyaivaiṣā parā devī svarūpāmarśanotsukā | pūrṇatvaṃ sarvabhāveṣu yasyā nālpaṃ na cādhikam | |	It is His Supreme Divine Force who is eager to manifest Him in the form of His own power of manifestation and serves in the form of perfection neither anyway less or nor more within all whatever is in existence.
eṣa devo'nayā devyā nityaṃ krīḍārasotsukaḥ | vicitrān sṛṣṭisaṃhārān vidhatte yugapatprabhuḥ | |	It is this Divine Being who remains always curious to keep Himself engaged in sporting with Her in the multitudinous forms of creation and dissolution both going on simultaneously.
atidurghaṭakāritvamasyānuttarameva yat | etadeva svatantratvamaiśvayaṃ bodharūpatā | |	It is in His accomplishment of such incredibly difficult tasks of this nature that lies His freedom of action, Lordship and wisdom.
paricchinnaprakāśatvaṃ jaḍasya kila lakṣaṇam | jaḍādvilakṣaṇo bodho yattena parimīyate |	Limitedness of luminosity is the characteristic feature of the inconscient. This is understood through the awareness which is different from inconscience.
evamasya svatantrasya nijaśaktyupabhogina | svātmagā sṛṣṭisaṃhārā svarūpatvena saṃsthitā | |	Bodhapañcadasikā Herein lies the autonomy of the Supernal Enjoyer of the world in the form of the acts of creation and dissolution as His fundamental nature well within Himself.
teṣu vaicitryamatyantamuccādhastiryageva yat | bhuvanāni tadīśāśca sukhadukhamitirbhava | |	Extreme variation in the shape and structure of the creation such as somewhere excessive height and somewhere excessive depth, somewhere excessive bending sideways, multitudinousness and variety of creations and their Lordships besides the extremity of joy and suffering form the nature of things here in the world.
yadetasyāparijñānaṃ tatsvātantryaṃ hi varṇitam | sa eva khalu saṃsāre jaḍānāṃ yo vibhīṣikā | |	Ignorance of this feature of His creation on the part of creatures is also considered as an aspect of His autonomy extending to the extreme in the world of inconscience and thus forming the point of sorrow on their ill-luck.
tatprasādavaśādeva gurvāgamata eva vā | śāstrādvā parameśasya yasmātkasmādupāyata|	It is by virtue of His grace that this kind of knowledge is made available to human beings through the teacher, scripture or discursive treatises somehow or the other in regard to the Supreme Controller.
yattat tasya parijñānaṃ sa mokṣa parameśatā | tatpūrṇatvaṃ prabuddhānāṃ jīvanmuktiśca sā smṛtā | |	Availability of this knowledge in its thoroughness known as liberation is also owing to His supreme governance. Perfection in that awareness consciousness as made possible in the case of enlightened persons has been called jīvan-mukti, redemption even in the state of living in the world.
etau bandhavimokṣau ca parameśasvarūpataḥ | na bhidyete na bhedo hi tattvata parameśvare | |	Bondage and liberation both these, too, are manifestation of the nature of the Supreme Lord Himself. They are so intertwined that they cannot be separated from each other since He is essentially immune to differentiation within Himself.
itthamicchākalājñānaśaktiśūlāmbujāśritaḥ | bhairavaḥ sarvabhāvānāṃ svabhāva pariśīlyate |	This is how Bhairava is contemplated on as the resort of the will of creativity, power of division, knowledge and power as well as thorn in the lotus and thus the inner nature of all the beings.
muktabhāramatīn śiṣyān prabodhayitumañjasā | ime 'bhinavaguptena ślokā pañcadaśeritā | |	These fifteen verses have been composed by Abhinavagupta for the sake of quick awareness of the disciples who have got redeemed of the burden of ignorance.

tvanmayametadaśeṣamidānīṃ bhāti mama tvadanugrahaśaktyā | tvaṃ ca maheśa sadaiva mamātmā svātmamayaṃ mama tena samastam | |	Due to your favour towards me, all this appears to be filled exclusively by you. O Great Lord, you are always my Self owing to which all this become one with my Self.
svātmani viśvagate tvayi nāthe tena na saṃsṛti bhītikathāsti | satsvapi durdharadakhavimohatrāsavidhāyiṣu karmagaṇeṣu |	All having been assimilated to the Self as you, O Lord, there has remained nothing like fear of worldliness in me in spite of remaining intact all the impressions of action in me which are terrific executors of trouble, delusion and fear.
antaka māṃ prati dṛśamenāṃ krodhakarālatamāṃ vinidhehi | śaṃkarasevanacintanadhīro bhīṣaṇabhairavaśaktimayo'smi |	O Champion of death, do not look towards me with your gaze bearing most terrific anger. On account of being in the contemplation of Siva, I am filled with terrible force of Bhairava.
itthamupoḍhabhavanmayasaṃviddodhitidāritabhūritamisaḥ | mṛtyuyamāntakakarmapiśācairnātha namo'stu na jātu vibhemi |	In this way, having got rid of the entire darkness having been shattered by the rays of your consciousness, now I am not afraid of the demons of the results of action any more. As such, I pay my obeisance to you, O Lord.
proditasatyavirodhamarīci prokṣitaviśvapadārthasatattva | bhāvaparāmṛtanirbharapūrṇe tvayyahamātmani nirvṛtimemi | |	I accede to you in the state of redemption having got enlightened by the rays of opposite to truth, besmeared of the delusion of the sense of actuality of the world and being filled with the supernal ambrosia of your being.

śrīabhinavaguptapādācāryakṛtaṃ kramastotraṃ sampūrṇam |	Note: Mārgaśirsa is the ninth month of the year of Hindu calendar starting from beginning on nd November and ending on st December.
saṃkrāmo'tra na bhāvanā na ca kathāyuktirna carcā na ca dhyānaṃ vā na ca dhāraṇā na ca japābhyāsaprayāso na ca | tatkiṃ nāma suniścitaṃ vada paraṃ satyaṃ ca tacchūyatāṃ na tyāgī na parigahī bhaja sukhaṃ sarva yathāvasthita | |	Anuttarāstikā There is no necessity of becoming affected by thoughts of others, nor by their emotions, nor by narrations nor by discussions. There is also no need of practising meditation and entering into dhāraņa nor of effort at practice of muttering of sacred words or verses. Therefore, the disciple asks kindly be specific about the final advice to him to undergo. The teacher answers the query you need neither to renounce anything nor to stick to anything else.
saṃsāro'sti na tattvatastanubhṛtāṃ bandhasya vārtava kā bandho yasya na jātu tasya vitathā muktasya muktikriyā | mithyāmohakṛdeṣa rajjubhujagacchāyāpiśācabhramo mā kiṃcittyaja mā gṛhāṇa vilasa svastho yathāvasthita |	Instead of these, keep yourself concentrated on the status quo of things and events. Whether the world is or is not? Discussion on this line eliminates the problem of both bondage and liberation as irrelevant. All this is a product of false attachment like the delusion of the rope-serpent or apprehension of the evil spirit in the dark shadow.
pūjāpūjakapūjyabhedasaraṇiḥ keyaṃ yathānuttare saṃkrāma kila kasya kena vidadhe ko vā praveśakrama | māyeyaṃ na cidadvayātparatarā bhinnāpyaho vartate na sarva svānubhavasvabhāvavimalaṃ cintāṃ vṛthā mā kṛthāḥ |	What you need to do is neither to cherish renunciation towards anything nor attachment to anything or event other than that. Remain self- contented where you are at the moment. Worship, worshipper and the entity worshipped these distinctions are divisive for which there is no place in the transcendental mode of thinking. Who has created these distinctions and what is the rationale behind it? All this is out and out delusion as there is nothing different from the non-dual consciousness.
ānando'tra na vittamadyamadavannaivāṅganāsaṅgavat dīpārkendukṛtaprabhāprakaravan naiva prakāśodaya| harṣa saṃbhṛtabhedamuktisukhabhūrbhārāvatāropamaḥ sarvādvaitapadasya vismṛtanidhe prāpti prakāśodaya | |	All is to be understood as one's own inner sense in all its purity takes for certain avoiding useless thinking. Unlike the pleasure of attaining wealth, taking wine, enjoying sex, contact with a young lady, unlike the light of lamp, the sun, the moon, unlike the joy of getting rid of a heavy weight, the delight of experience of oneness with the realisation of the illumination of consciousness is like recovery of the forgotten precious wealth.
rāgadveṣasukhāsukhodayalayāhaṅkāradainyādayo ye bhāvā pravibhānti viśvavapuṣo bhinnasvabhāvā na te | vyaktiṃ paśyasi yasya yasya sahasā tattattadekātmatā saṃvidrūpamavekṣya kiṃ na ramase tadabhāvanānirbhara | |	Senses of attachment, enmity, pleasure, pain, egoism, depression, etc. are by no means different from the Lord having assumed the universe as His body. Whichsoever individual you happen to look at suddenly having considered him ,Anuttarāstikā as a manifestation of the Consciousness; why do you not get to be pleased him depending on this attitude towards him? Individuals of this world have emerged from their prior state of non-being and have been undergoing continuous change.
pūrvābhāvabhavakriyā hi sahasā bhāvā sadā'sminbhave madhyākāravikārasaṅkaravatāṃ teṣāṃ kuta satyatā | nisatye capale prapañcanicaye svapnabhame peśale śaṅkātaṅkalaṅkayuktikalanātīta prabuddho bhava | |	In view of this, where is their reality in the middle being subjected to admixture of constancy and flux ? Having transcended the state of perception of the unreal fleeting, mixture of five elements, and having taken the reality of the world like delusion of the state of dream, be awakened from and transcend the state of terror of doubt and calculation of nonsensical reasoning.
bhāvanāṃ na samudbhavo'sti sahajastvabhāvitā bhāntyamī nisatyā api satyatāmanubhavabhrāntyā bhajanti kṣaṇam | tvatsaṃkalpaja eṣa viśvamahimā nāstyasya janmānyata tasmāttvaṃ vibhavena bhāsi bhuvaneṣvekopyanekātmakaḥ | |	There is nothing like spontaneous manifestation of entities. Their manifestation is rather due to your own contemplation of them as such. Though shorn of reality, they are getting the notion of reality momentarily quite delusively. The glory of the world is a product of you yourself. There is nothing like birth, etc.
yatsatyaṃ yadasatyamalpabahulaṃ nityaṃ na nityaṃ ca yat yanmāyāmalinaṃ yadātmavimalaṃ cidarpaṇe rājate | tatsarva svavimarśasaṃvidudayāda rūpaprakāśātmakaṃ jñātvā svānubhavādhirūḍhamahimā viśveśvaratvaṃ bhaja | | arkendudīpādyavabhāsabhinnaṃ nābhātyativyāptatayā tataśca | prakāśarūpaṃ tadiyat prakāśyaprakāśatākhyā vyavahāra eva | |	It is due to this delusion that though one, you appear as many in the world under the glory of manifestation. Having understood the paradox of reality and falsehood, scarcity and abundance, constancy and flux, malignity through delusion and purity of self-consciousness as reflected in the receptacle of consciousness, citta, as manifestations of self- contemplation in form as well as illumination are various features of your contemplation, become one with the Lord in all His universality. Paramārthacarcā Deliberation on the Supreme Objective of Life Different from the light of the sun, the moon and the lamp is the illumination of the Self which normally is not cognised due to its all-pervasiveness.
jñānādvibhinno na hi kaścidarthastattatkṛta saṃvidi nāsti bheda | svayaṃprakāśācchatamaikadhāmni prātisvikī nāpivibheditāsyāt |	None of the objects is essentially different from its understanding. Whatever differentiation is done from object to object has nothing to do with its essential understanding. Since the original source of illumination is self-luminous, the difference of object from object ought not to prevail in It.
itthaṃ svasaṃviddhana eka eva śiva sa viśvasya para prakāśa | tatrāpi bhātyeva vicitraśaktau grāhya gṛhītṛpravibhāga bheda | |	In this way, Śiva alone in his uniqueness is the compound mass of self- consciousness and hence the supernal illumination of the world. It is in His peculiar force that lies all difference of the receiver and the received.
bhedaḥ sa cāyaṃ na tato vibhinna svacchandasusvacchatamaikadhāmna | prāsādahastyaśvapayodasindhurgiryādi yadvanmaṇidarpaṇāde |	f The differentiation from object to object is no way different from the original source of illumination which is autonomous and is extremely pure. All sense of differentiation is like reflections of palace, elephant, horse, cloud, river, mountain, etc., seen in a gem or mirror as different from what is reflected.
ādarśakukṣau pratibimbakāri sabimbakaṃ syādyadi mānasiddham | svacchandasaṃvinmukurāntarāle bhāveṣu hetvantaramasti nānyat |	If this be accepted as self-proved that in the mirror of the mother's womb whatever gets reflected necessarily assumes the same shape and form as of the object reflected, the mirror of the pure consciousness need not require any external cause besides itself in giving shape to things whatever exists here in the world.
saṃviddhanastena parastvameva tvayyeva viśvāni cakāsati drāk | sphuranti ca tvanmahasa prabhāvāt tvameva caiṣāṃ parameśa kartā |	If oneness of reflection and the object reflected be accepted as self-proved, then O, enlightened Self it is you yourself who is Supreme Being and whatever is there in its entirety has got reflected immediately in you. These are flourishing by virtue of your grace and you yourself, O Supreme Being, as their creator.
itthaṃ svasaṃvedanamādisiddhamasādhyamātmānamanīśamīśam | svaśaktisampūrṇamadeśakālaṃ nityaṃ vibhuṃ bhairavanāthamīḍe |	Understanding of oneself like this is self-proved from the very beginning. What has remained to be proved is the servility of the Lord who is self-powered, Paramārthacarcā- Deliberation on the Supreme Objective of Life perfect in Himself, lies beyond the limitations of time and space, is eternal and all-pervading.
sadavṛttasaptakamidaṃ galitānyacintā samyak smaranti hṛdaye paramārthakāmā | te bhairavīyaparadhāma muhurviṃśanti jānanti ca trijagatīparamārthacarcām |	This group of seven verses involves evaporation of all other anxieties and considerations and hence is to be kept properly settled in the heart by aspirants of the supreme objective of life. As a consequence of it they enter into the highest abode of Bhairava again and again and understand the secret of the supreme state of being lying in transcendence of the range of the three worlds.
antarlakṣyavilīnacittapavano yogī yadā vartate dṛṣṭyā niścalatārayā bahirasau paśyannapaśyannapi | mudreyaṃ khalu śāmbhavī bhavati sā yuṣmaprasādāda guro śūnyāśūnyavivarjitaṃ bhavati yat tattvaṃ padaṃ śāmbhavam | |	Anubhavanivedanam Tribute to the Inner Experience When the yogin reaches the state in which owing to withdrawal of the attention inward citta and prāņa get merged into it, due to focus of the attention having been settled on one point, he seems to see outward but really does not see at all. This is the śāmbhavi mudrā assumed by your grace, O Gurudeva, shorn of the sense of being and non-being both and coinciding with your state of oneness with Śiva amounting to merger of individuality into the Absolute.
ardhodghāṭitalocana sthiramanā nāsāgadattekṣaṇa ścandrārkāvapi līnatāmupagato trispandabhāvāntare | jyotīrūpamaśeṣabāhyarahitaṃ caika pumāsa paraṃ tattvaṃ tatpadameti vastu paramaṃ vācyaṃ kimatrādhikam |	My eyes are only half-open, my manas has become settled at one point, eyesight has got concentrated on the tip of the nose, prāņa and apāna both have disappeared into the threefold vibration of the individual, universal and Transcendent. Rid of the entire external form of the world one being in the form of a Person as the Light has emerged representing the state of oneness of the individual and the Absolute.
śabda kaścana yo mukhādudayate mantra sa lokottara saṃsthānaṃ sukhadu khajanmavapuṣo yatkāpi mudraiva sā | prāṇasya svarasena yatpravahaṇaṃ yogaḥ sa evādadbhuta śāktaṃ dhāma paraṃ mamānubhavata kinnāma na bhājate |	As such, what else remains to speak of! Whatever word emerges from the mouth, becomes a mantra of transcendent nature, whatever posture this body as the seat of sheer pleasure and pain assumes, becomes a mudrā. The flow of the prāņa in howsoever spontaneous a way, becomes an unprecedented form of yoga.
mantra sa pratibhāti varṇaracanā yasminna saṃlakṣyate mudrā sā samudeti yatra galitā kṛtsnā kriyā kāyikī | yoga sa prathate yataḥ pravahaṇaṃ prāṇasya saṃkṣīyate tvaddhāmādhigamotsvaveṣu sudhiyāṃ kiṃ kiṃ na nāmādabhutam |	What else, then, remains to be manifested! The Mantra becomes so much attenuated in sound as to lose distinction of letters from one another involved in its composition Mudrā gets assumed which becomes entire shorn of the physical effort. That state of yoga becomes spontaneous to them in which the flow of breath becomes subtlised to the extreme. What remains without becoming surprising on entry of wise people into your abode, O Lord!
