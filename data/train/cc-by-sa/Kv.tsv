daśasu pariṇateṣvahaḥsu caivaṃ prayatamanāḥ parayā mudā parītaḥ | akuruta japahomamaṃgalādyāḥ paramatamāḥ sa sutasya devatejyāḥ ||	When ten days were fulfilled after his son’s birth, with his thoughts kept under restraint, and filled with excessive joy, he offered for his son most elaborate sacrifices to the gods with muttered prayers, oblations, and all kinds of auspicious ceremonies.
api ca śatasahasrapūrṇasaṃkhyāḥ sthirabalavattanayāḥ sahemaśṛṃgīḥ | anupagatajarāḥ payasvinīrgāḥ svayamadadātsutavṛddhaye dvijebhyaḥ ||	And he himself gave to the Brāhmans for his son’s welfare cows full of milk, with no traces of infirmity, golden-horned and with strong healthy calves, to the full number of a hundred thousand.
bahuvidhaviṣayāstato yatātmā svahṛdayatoṣakarīḥ kriyā vidhāya | guṇavati divase śive muhūrte matimakaronmuditaḥ purapraveśe ||	Then he, with his soul under strict restraint, having performed all kinds of ceremonies which rejoiced his heart, on a fortunate day, in an auspicious moment, gladly determined to enter his city.

puramatha purataḥ praveśya patnīṃ sthavirajanānugatāmapatyanāthām | nṛpatirapi jagāma paurasaṃghairdivamamarairmaghavānivārcyamānaḥ ||	Having made his wife with her child  enter first into the city, accompanied by the aged attendants, the king himself also advanced, saluted by the hosts of the citizens, as Indra entering heaven, saluted by the immortals.
bhavanamatha vigāhya śākyarājo bhava iva ṣaṇmukhajanmanā pratītaḥ | idamidamiti harṣapūrṇavaktro bahuvidhapuṣṭiyaśaskaraṃ vyadhatta ||	The Śākya king, having entered his palace, like Bhava  well-pleased at the birth of Kārttikeya,  with his face full of joy, gave orders for lavish expenditure, showing all kinds of honour and liberality.
iti narapatiputrajanmavṛddhyā sajanapadaṃ kapilāhvayaṃ puraṃ tat | dhanadapuramivāpsaro 'vakīrṇaṃ muditamabhūnnalakūvaraprasūtau ||	Thus at the good fortune of the birth of the king’s son, that city surnamed after Kapila, with all the surrounding inhabitants, was full of gladness like the city of the lord of wealth,  crowded with heavenly nymphs, at the birth of his son Nalakūvara.
tatastadā maṃtripurohitau tau vāṣpapratodābhihatau nṛpeṇa | viddhau sadaśvāviva sarvayatnātsauhārdaśīghraṃ yayaturvanaṃ tat ||	Then the two, the counsellor and the family priest, beaten by the king with his scourge of tears, went with every effort to that forest in the hurry of affection, like two noble horses goaded.
tamāśramam jātapariśramau tāvupetya kāle sadṛśānuyātrau | rājarddhimutsṛjya vinītaceṣṭāvupeyaturbhārgavadhiṣṇyameva ||	Having come at last full of weariness to that hermitage, accompanied by a fitting train, — they dismissed their royal pomp and with sober gestures entered the abode of Bhārgava.
tau nyāyatastaṃ pratipūjya vipraṃ tenārcitau tāvapi cānurūpam | kṛtāsanau bhārgavamāsanasthaṃ chittvā kathāmūcaturātmakṛtyam ||	Having saluted that Brāhman with due respect, and having been honoured by him with due reverence in return, having seated themselves, plunging at once into the subject, they addressed Bhārgava, who was likewise seated, concerning their errand.
śuddhaujasaḥ śuddhaviśālakīrterikṣvākuvaṃśaprabhavasya rājñaḥ | imaṃ janaṃ vettu bhavānadhīraṃ śrutagrahe maṃtraparigrahe ca ||	‘Let your honour know us to be respectively imperfect proficients in preserving the sacred learning and in retaining the state-counsels, — in the service of the monarch of the Ikṣvāku race, pure in his valour and pure and wide in his glory.
tasyeṃdrakalpasya jayaṃtakalpaḥ putro jarāmṛtyubhayaṃ titīrṣuḥ | ihābhyupetaḥ kila tasya hetorāvāmupetau bhagavānavaitu ||	‘His son, who is like Jayanta, while he himself is like Indra, has come here, it is said, desirous to escape from the fear of old age and death, — know that we two are come here on account of him.’
tau so 'bravīdasti sa dīrghabāhuḥ prāptaḥ kumāro na tu nāvabuddhaḥ | dharmo 'yamāvartaka ityavetya yātastvarāḍābhimukho mumukṣuḥ ||	He answered them, ‘That prince of the long arms did indeed come here, but not as one unawakened; “this dharma only brings us back again,” — recognising this, he went off forthwith towards Arāḍa, seeking liberation.’
tasmāttatastāvupalabhya tattvaṃ taṃ vipramāmaṃttya tadaiva sadyaḥ | khinnāvakhinnāviva rājaputraḥ prasasratustena yataḥ sa yātaḥ ||	Then they two, having understood the true state of things, bade that Brāhman at once farewell, and wearied though they were, went on as if they were unwearied, thither whither the prince was gone.
yāṃtau tatastau sṛjayā vihīnamapaśyatāṃ taṃ vapuṣā jvalaṃtam | nṛpopaviṣṭaṃ pathi vṛkṣamūle sūryaṃ ghanābhogamiva praviṣṭam ||	As they were going, they saw him bereft of all ornaments,  but still radiant with his beauty, sitting like a king in the road at the foot of a tree, like the sun under the canopy of a cloud.
yānaṃ vihāyopayayau tatastaṃ purohito maṃtradhareṇa sārdham | yathā vanasthaṃ sahavāmadevo rāmaṃ didṛkṣurmuniraurvaśeyaḥ ||	Leaving his chariot, the family priest then went up to the prince with the counsellor, as the saint Aurvaśeya  went with Vāmadeva, wishing to see Rāma when he dwelt in the forest.
tāvarcayāmāsaturarhatastaṃ divīva śukrāṃgirasau maheṃdram | pratyarcayāmāsa sa cārhatastau divīva śukrāṃgirasau maheṃdraḥ ||	They paid him honour as was fitting, as Śukra and Aṅgiras honoured Indra in heaven; and he in return paid due honour to them, as Indra in heaven to Śukra and Aṅgiras.
kṛtābhyanujñāvabhitastatastau niṣīdatuḥ śākyakuladhvajasya | virejatustasya ca saṃnikarṣe punarvasū yogagatāviveṃdoḥ ||	Then they, having obtained his permission, sat down near him who was the banner of the Śākya race; and they shone in his proximity like the two stars of the asterism Punarvasū in conjunction with the moon.
taṃ vṛkṣamūlasthamabhijvalaṃtaṃ purohito rājasutaṃ babhāṣe | yathopaviṣṭaṃ divi pārijāte vṛhaspatiḥ śakrasutaṃ jayaṃtam ||	The family priest addressed the prince who shone brightly as he sat at the foot of the tree, as Vṛhaspati addressed Indra’s son Jayanta, seated in heaven under the heavenly tree pārijāta:
tvacchokaśalye hṛdayāvagāḍhe mohaṃ gato bhūmitale muhūrtam | kumāra rājā nayanāṃbuvarṣo yattvāmavocattadidaṃ nibodha ||	‘O prince, consider for a moment what the king with his eyes raining tears said to thee, as he lay fainting on the ground with the arrow of thy sorrow plunged into his heart.
jānāmi dharmaṃ prati niścayaṃ te paraimi te 'cyāvinametamartham | ahaṃ tvakāle vanasaṃśrayātte śokāgnināgnipratimena dahye ||	“I know that thy resolve is fixed upon religion, and I am convinced that this purpose of thine is unchanging;  but I am consumed with a flame of anguish like fire at thy flying to the woods at an inopportune time.
tadehi dharmapriya matpriyārthaṃ dharmārthameva tyaja buddhimetām | ayaṃ hi mā śokarayaḥ pravṛddho nadīrayaḥ kūlamivābhihaṃti ||	“Come, thou who lovest duty, for the sake of what is my heart’s desire, — abandon this purpose for the sake of duty; this huge swollen stream of sorrow sweeps me away as a river’s torrent its bank.
meghāṃbukakṣādriṣu yā hi vṛttiḥ samīraṇārkāgnimahāśanīnām | tāṃ vṛttimasmāsu karoti śoko vikarṣaṇocchoṣaṇadāhabhedaiḥ ||	“That effect  which is wrought in the clouds, water, the dry grass, and the mountains by the wind, the sun, the fire, and the thunderbolt, — that same effect this grief produces in us by its tearing in pieces, its drying up, its burning, and its cleaving.
tadbhuṃkṣva tāvadvasudhādhipatyaṃ kāle vanaṃ yāsyasi śāstradṛṣṭe | aniṣṭabaṃdhau kuru māpyupekṣāṃ sarveṣu bhūteṣu dayā hi dharmaḥ ||	“Enjoy therefore for a while the sovereignty of the earth, — thou shalt go to the forest at the time provided by the śāstras, — do not show disregard for thy unhappy kindred, — compassion for all creatures is the true religion.
na caiṣa dharmo vana eva siddhaḥ pure 'pi siddhirniyatā yatīnām | buddhiśca yatnaśca nimittamatra vanaṃ ca liṃgaṃ ca hi bhīrucihnam ||	“Religion is not wrought out only in the forests, the salvation of ascetics can be accomplished even in a city; thought and effort are the true means; the forest and the badge are only a coward’s signs.
maulīdharairaṃsaviṣaktahāraiḥ keyūraviṣṭabdhasrajairnareṃdraiḥ | lakṣmyaṃkamadhye parivartamānaiḥ prāpto gṛhasthairapi mokṣadharmaḥ ||	“Liberation has been attained even by householders, Indras among men, who wore diadems, and carried strings of pearls suspended on their shoulders, whose garlands were entangled with bracelets, and who lay cradled in the lap of Fortune.
dhruvānujau yau balivajrabāhū vaibhrājamāṣāḍhamathāṃtidevam | videharājaṃ janakaṃ tathaiva pākadrumaṃ senajitaśca rājñaḥ ||	“Bali and Vajrabāhu, the two younger brothers of Dhruva, Vaibhrāja, Āṣāḍha and Antideva,  and Janaka also, the king of the Videhas, and king Senajit’s son, his tree of ripe blessing;
etān gṛhasthān nṛpatīnavehi naiḥśreyase dharmavidhau vinītān | ubhe 'pi tasmādyugapadbhajasva cittādhipatyaṃ ca nṛpaśriyaṃ ca ||	“Know that all these great kings who were householders were well skilled in attaining the merit which leads to final bliss, — do thou also therefore obtain both  simultaneously — royal magnificence and the control over the mind.
icchāmi hi tvāmupaguhya gāḍhaṃ kṛtābhiṣekaṃ salilārdrameva | dhṛtātapatraṃ samudīkṣamāṇastenaiva harṣeṇa vanaṃ praveṣṭum ||	“I desire, — when I have once closely embraced thee after thy kingly consecration is once performed, and while thou art still wet with the sacred water, — when I behold thee with the pomp of the royal umbrella, — in the fulness of that joy to enter the forest.”
ityabravīdbhūmipatirbhavaṃtaṃ vākyena vāṣpagrathitākṣareṇa | śrutvā bhavānarhati tatpriyārthaṃ snehena tatsnehamanuprayātum ||	‘Thus did the king say to thee in a speech whose words were stopped by tears, — surely having heard it, for the sake of what is so dear to him, thou wilt with all affection follow his affection.
śokāṃbhasi tvatprabhave hyagādhe duḥkhārṇave majjati śākyarājaḥ | tasmāttamuttāraya nāthahīnaṃ nirāśrayaṃ magnamivārṇave gām ||	‘The king of the Śākyas is drowned in a deep sea of sorrow, full of waves of trouble, springing from thee; do thou therefore deliver him helpless and protectorless like an ox drowning in the sea.
bhīṣmeṇa gaṃgodarasaṃbhavena rāmeṇa rāmeṇa ca bhārgaveṇa | śrutvā kṛtaṃ karma pituḥ priyārthaṃ pitustvamapyarhasi kartumiṣṭam ||	‘Having heard that Bhīṣma who sprang from Gaṅgā’s womb, Rāma, and Rāma the son of Bhṛgu, — all did what would please their fathers; surely thou too wilt do thy father’s desire.
saṃvardhayitrīṃ ca samehi devīmagastyajuṣṭāṃ diśamaprayātām | pranaṣṭavatsāmiva vatsalāṃ gāmajasramārttāṃ kalituṃ na cārhasi ||	‘Consider also the queen, who brought thee up, who has not yet gone to the region inhabited by Agastya  — wilt thou not take some heed of her, who ceaselessly grieves like a fond cow that has lost her calf?
haṃsena haṃsīmiva viprayuktāṃ tyaktāṃ gajeneva vane kareṇum | ārttāṃ sanāthāmapi nāthahīnāṃ trātuṃ vadhūmarhasi darśanena ||	‘Surely thou wilt succour thy wife by the sight of thee, who now mourns widowed yet with her lord still alive, — like a swan separated from her mate or a female elephant deserted in the forest by her companion.
ekaṃ sutaṃ bālamanarhaduḥkhaṃ saṃtāpasaṃtapta [… … … … …] | taṃ rāhulaṃ mokṣaya baṃdhuśokād rāhūpasargādiva pūrṇacaṃdram ||	‘Thy only son, a child little deserving such woe, distressed with sorrow, and  [… … … … …] — O deliver Rāhula from the grief of his kindred like the full moon from the contact of Rāhu!
śokāgninā tvadviraheṃdhanena niḥśvāsadhūmena tamaḥśikhena | tvaddarśanāyarchati dahyamānaḥ so 'ṃtaḥpuraṃ caiva puraṃ ca kṛtsnam ||	‘Burned with the fire of anguish within him, to which thy absence adds fresh fuel, — a fire whose smoke is sighs and its flame despair, — he wanders for a sight of thee through the women’s apartments and the whole city.’
sa bodhisattvaḥ paripūrṇasattvaḥ śrutvā vacastasya purohitasya | dhyātvā muhūrtaṃ guṇavadguṇajñaḥ pratyuttaraṃ praśritamityuvāca ||	The Bodhisattva, — whose perfection was absolute, — having heard the words of the family priest, reflected for a moment, knowing all the virtues of the virtuous, and then thus uttered his gentle reply:
avaimi bhāvaṃ tanayaprasaktaṃ viśeṣato yo mayi bhūmipasya | jānannapi vyādhijarāvipadbhyo bhītastvagatyā svajanaṃ tyajāmi ||	‘I well know the paternal tenderness  of the king, especially that which he has displayed towards me; yet knowing this as I do, still alarmed at sickness, old age, and death, I am inevitably forced to leave my kindred.
draṣṭuṃ priyaṃ kaḥ svajanaṃ hi necchennāsau yadi syātpriyaviprayogaḥ | yadā tu bhūtvāpi bhavedviyogastato guruṃ snigdhamapi tyajāmi ||	‘Who would not wish to see his dear kindred, if but this separation from beloved ones did not exist? but since even after it has been once, separation will still come again, it is for this that I abandon my father, however loving.
maddhetukaṃ yattu narādhipasya śokaṃ bhavānarhati na priyaṃ me | yatsvapnabhūteṣu samāgameṣu saṃtapyate bhāvini viprayogaiḥ ||	‘I do not however approve that thou shouldst consider the king’s grief as caused by me, when in the midst of his dream-like unions he is afflicted by thoughts of separations in the future.
evaṃ ca te niścayametu buddhirdṛṣṭvā vicitraṃ vividhapracāram | saṃtāpaheturna suto na baṃdhurajñānanaimittika eṣa tāpaḥ ||	‘Thus let thy thoughts settle into certainty, having seen the multiform in its various developments; neither a son nor kindred is the cause of sorrow, — this sorrow is only caused by ignorance.
yadādhvagānāmiva saṃgatānāṃ kāle viyogo niyataḥ prajānām | prājño janaḥ ko nu bhajeta śokaṃ baṃdhupriyaḥ sannapi baṃdhuhīnaḥ ||	‘Since parting is inevitably fixed in the course of time for all beings, just as for travellers who have joined company on a road, — what wise man would cherish sorrow, when he loses his kindred, even though he loves them?
ihaiti hitvā svajanaṃ paratra pralabhya cehāpi punaḥ prayāti | gatvāpi tatrāpyaparatra gacchetyevaṃ jano yogini ko 'nurodhaḥ ||	‘Leaving his kindred in another world, he departs hither; and having stolen away  from them here, he goes forth once more; “having gone thither, go thou elsewhere also,” — such is the lot of mankind, — what consideration can the yogin have for them?
yadā ca garbhātprabhṛti prajānāṃ vadhāya [… …] nubadhāya mṛtyuḥ  | kasmādakāle vanasaṃśrayaṃ me putrapriyastatra bhavān avocat ||	‘Since from the moment of leaving the womb death is a characteristic adjunct,  why, in thy affection for thy son, hast thou called my departure to the forest ill-timed?
bhavatyakālo viṣayābhipattau kālastathaivābhividhau pradiṣṭaḥ | kālo jagatkarṣati sarvakālānarcārhake śreyasi sarvakālaḥ ||	‘There may be an “ill time” in one’s attaining a worldly object, — time indeed is described as inseparably connected with all things;  time drags the world into all its various times; but all time suits a bliss which is really worthy of praise.
rājyaṃ mumukṣurmayi yacca rājā tadapyudāraṃ sadṛśaṃ pituśca | pratigrahītuṃ mama na kṣamaṃ tu lobhādapathyānnamivāturasya ||	‘That the king should wish to surrender to me his kingdom, — this is a noble thought, well worthy of a father; but it would be as improper for me to accept it, as for a sick man through greed to accept unwholesome food.
kathaṃ nu mohāyatanaṃ nṛpatvaṃ kṣamaṃ prapattuṃ viduṣā nareṇa | sodvegatā yatra madaḥ śramaśca paropacāreṇa ca dharmapīḍā ||	‘How can it be right for the wise man to enter royalty, the home of illusion, where are found anxiety, passion, and weariness, and the violation of all right through another’s service?
jāṃbūnadaṃ harmyamiva pradīptaṃ viṣeṇa saṃyuktamivottamānnam | grāhākulaṃ ca sthitaṃ [… … … … … … …] ramyaṃ vyasanāśrayaṃ ca  ||	‘The golden palace seems to me to be on fire; the daintiest viands seem mixed with poison; infested with crocodiles  [is the tranquil lotus-bed].’
varaṃ hi bhuktāni tṛṇānyaraṇye toṣaṃ paraṃ ratnamivopaguhya | sahoṣitaṃ śrīsulabhairna caiva doṣairadṛśyairiva kṛṣṇasarpaiḥ ||	For it is better to eat herbs in the forest, embracing the highest contentment as if one were concealing a jewel, than to live with the dangers to which sovereignty is exposed, as if with loathsome black snakes.
ślāghyaṃ hi rājyāni vihāya rājñāṃ dharmābhilāṣeṇa vanaṃ praveṣṭum | bhagnapratijñasya na tūpapannaṃ vanaṃ parityajya gṛhaṃ praveṣṭum ||	For it is praiseworthy for kings to leave their kingdoms and enter the forest in the desire for dharma, but it is not fitting to break one’s vow and forsaking the forest to go to one’s home.
jātaḥ kule ko hi naraḥ sasattvo dharmābhilāṣeṇa vanaṃ praviṣṭaḥ | kāṣāyamutsṛjya vimuktalajjaḥ puraṃdarasyāpi puraṃ śrayeta ||	For what man of resolution and good family, having once gone to the forest in the desire for dharma, would cast off the robe and, dead to shame, proceed to the city even of Puraṃdara?
lobhāddhi mohādathavā bhayena yo vāṃtamannaṃ punarādadīta | lobhātsa mohādathavā bhayena saṃtyajya kāmān punarādadīta ||	For only the man, who from greed, delusion or fear, would take again the food he has vomited up, would from greed, delusion or fear, abondon the lusts of the flesh and then return to them.
yaśca pradīptāccharaṇātkathaṃcinniṣkramya bhūyaḥ praviśettadeva | gārhasthyamutsṛjya sa dṛṣṭadoṣo mohena bhūyo 'bhilaṣedgrahītum ||	And the man who, after escaping with difficulty from a burning house, would enter that very house again, only he, after giving up the state of a householder, because he sees its dangers, would desire out of delusion to assume it again.
yā ca śrutirmokṣamavāptavanto nṛpā gṛhasthā iti naitadasti | śamapradhānaḥ kva ca mokṣadharmo daṃḍapradhānaḥ kva ca rājadharmaḥ ||	As for the tradition that kings obtained final emancipation while remaining in their homes, this is not the case. How can the dharma of salvation in which quietude predominates be reconciled with the dharma of kings in which severity of action predominates?
śame ratiścecchithilaṃ ca rājyaṃ rājye matiścecchamaviplavaśca | śamaśca taikṣṇyaṃ ca hi nopapannaṃ śītoṣṇayoraikyamivodakāgnyoḥ ||	If a king delights in quietude, his kingdom collapses; if his mind turns to his kingdom, his quietude is ruined. For quietude and severity are incompatible, like the union of water which is cold and fire which is hot.
tanniścayādvā vasudhādhipāste rājyāni muktvā śamamāptavaṃtaḥ | rājyāṃgitā vā nibhṛtendriyatvādanaiṣṭhike mokṣakṛtābhimānāḥ ||	Either therefore these lords of the earth resolutely cast aside their kingdoms and obtained quietude, or stained by kingship, they claimed to have attained liberation on the ground that their senses were under control, but in fact only reached a state that was not final.
teṣāṃ ca rājye 'stu śamo yathāvatprāpto vanaṃ nāhamaniścayena | chittvā hi pāśaṃ gṛhabaṃdhusaṃjñaṃ muktaḥ punarna pravivikṣurasmi ||	Or let it be conceded they duly attained quietude while holding kingship, still I have not gone to the forest with an undecided mind; for having cut through the net known as home and kindred I am freed and have no intention of re-entering the net.”
ityātmavijñānaguṇānurūpaṃ muktaspṛhaṃ hetumadūrjitaṃ ca | śrutvā nareṃdrātmajamuktavantaṃ pratyuttaraṃ maṃtradharo 'pyuvāca ||	Having heard the king’s son uttering this discourse, well suitable to his virtues and knowledge of the soul, freed from all desires, full of sound reasons, and weighty, — the counsellor thus made answer:
yo niścayo maṃtravarastavāyaṃ nāyaṃ na yukto na tu kālayuktaḥ | śokāya hitvā pitaraṃ vayaḥsthaṃ syāddharmakāmasya hi te na dharmaḥ ||	‘This resolve of thine is an excellent counsel, not unfit in itself but only unfit at the present time; it could not be thy duty, loving duty as thou dost, to leave thy father in his old age to sorrow.
nūnaṃ ca buddhistava nātisūkṣmā dharmārthakāmeṣvavicakṣaṇā vā | hetoradṛṣṭasya phalasya yastvaṃ pratyakṣamarthaṃ paribhūya yāsi ||	‘Surely thy mind is not very penetrating, or it is ill-skilled in examining duty, wealth, and pleasure,  — when for the sake of an unseen result thou departest disregarding a visible end.
punarbhavo 'stīti ca kecidāhurnāstīti kecinniyatapratijñāḥ | evaṃ yadā saṃśayito 'yamarthastasmāt kṣamaṃ bhoktumupasthitā śrīḥ ||	‘Again, some say that there is another birth, — others with confident assertion say that there is not; since then the matter is all in doubt, it is right to enjoy the good fortune which comes into thy hand.
bhūyaḥ pravṛttiryadi kācidasti raṃsyāmahe tatra yathopapattau | atha pravṛttiḥ parato na kācitsiddho 'prayatnājjagato 'sya mokṣaḥ ||	‘If there is any activity hereafter, we will enjoy ourselves in it as may offer; or if there is no activity beyond this life, then there is an assured liberation to all the world without any effort.
astīti kecitparalokamāhurmokṣasya yogaṃ na tu varṇayaṃti | agneryathā hyuṣṇamapāṃ dravatvaṃ tadvatpravṛttau prakṛtiṃ vadaṃti ||	‘Some say there is a future life, but they do not allow the possibility of liberation; as fire is hot by nature and water liquid, so they hold that there is a special nature in our power of action.
kecitsvabhāvāditi varṇayaṃti śubhāśubhaṃ caiva bhavābhavau ca | svābhāvikaṃ sarvamidaṃ ca yasmādato 'pi mogho bhavati prayatnaḥ ||	‘Some maintain that all things arise from inherent properties, — both good and evil and existence and non-existence; and since all this world thus arises spontaneously, therefore also all effort of ours is vain.
yadiṃdriyāṇāṃ niyataḥ pracāraḥ priyāpriyatvaṃ viṣayeṣu caiva | saṃyujyate yajjarayārttibhiśca kastatra yatno nanu sa svabhāvaḥ ||	‘Since the action of the senses is fixed, and so too the agreeableness or the disagreeableness of outward objects, — then for that which is united to old age and pains, what effort can avail to alter it? Does it not all arise spontaneously?
adbhirhutāśaḥ śamamabhyupaiti tejāṃsi cāpo gamayaṃti śoṣam | bhinnāni bhūtāni śarīrasaṃsthānyaikyaṃ ca dattvā jagadudvahaṃti ||	‘The fire becomes quenched by water, and fire causes  water to evaporate; and different elements, united in a body, producing unity, bear up the world.
yatpāṇipādodarapṛṣṭhamūrdhnā nirvartate garbhagatasya bhāvaḥ | yadātmanastasya ca tena yogaḥ svābhāvikaṃ tatkathayaṃti tajjñāḥ ||	‘That the nature of the embryo in the womb is produced as composed of hands, feet, belly, back, and head, and that it is also united with the soul, — the wise declare that all this comes of itself spontaneously.
kaḥ kaṃṭakasya prakaroti taikṣṇyaṃ vicitrabhāvaṃ mṛgapakṣiṇāṃ vā | svabhāvataḥ sarvamidaṃ pravṛttaṃ na kāmakāro 'sti kutaḥ prayatnaḥ ||	‘Who causes the sharpness of the thorn? or the various natures of beasts and birds? All this has arisen spontaneously; there is no acting from desire, how then can there be such a thing as will?
sargaṃ vadaṃtīśvaratastathānye tatra prayatne puruṣaṣya ko 'rthaḥ | ya eva heturjagataḥ pravṛttau heturnivṛttau niyataḥ sa eva ||	‘Others say that creation comes from Īśvara, what need then is there of the effort of the conscious soul?  That which is the cause of the action of the world, is also determined as the cause of its ceasing to act.
kecidvadaṃtyātmanimittameva prādurbhavaṃ caiva bhavakṣayaṃ ca | prādurbhavaṃ tu pravadaṃtyayatnādyatnena mokṣādhigamaṃ bruvaṃti ||	‘Some say that the coming into being and the destruction of being are alike caused by the soul, but they say that coming into being arises without effort, while the attainment of liberation is by effort.
naraḥ pitsup>oṇāmanṛṇaḥ prajābhirvedairṛṣīṇāṃ kratubhiḥ surāṇām | utpadyate sārdhamṛṇaistribhistairyasyāsti mokṣaḥ kila tasya mokṣaḥ ||	‘A man discharges his debt to his ancestors by begetting offspring, to the saints by sacred lore, to the gods by sacrifices; he is born with these three debts upon him, — whoever has liberation (from these,) he indeed has liberation.
ityevametena vidhikrameṇa mokṣaṃ sayatnasya vadaṃti tajjñāḥ | prayatnavaṃto 'pi hi vikrameṇa mumukṣavaḥ khedamavāpnuvaṃti ||	‘Thus by this series of rules the wise promise liberation to him who uses effort; but however ready for effort with all their energy, those who seek liberation will find weariness.
tatsaumya mokṣe yadi bhaktirasti nyāyena sevasva vidhiṃ yathoktam | evaṃ bhaviṣyatyupapattirasya saṃtāpanāśaśca narādhipasya ||	‘Therefore, gentle youth, if thou hast a love for liberation, follow rightly the prescribed rule; thus wilt thou thyself attain to it, and the king’s grief will come to an end.
yā ca pravṛttā bhavadoṣabuddhistapovanebhyo bhavanaṃ praveṣṭum | tatrāpi ciṃtā tava tāta mā bhūt pūrve 'pi jagmuḥ svagṛhaṃ vanebhyaḥ ||	‘And as for thy meditations on the evils of life ending in thy return from the forest to thy home, — let not the thought of this trouble thee, my son, — those in old time also have returned from the forests to their houses.
tapovanastho 'pi vṛtaḥ prajābhirjagāma rājā puramaṃbarīṣaḥ | tathā mahīṃ viprakṛtāmanāryaistapovanādetya rarakṣa rāmaḥ ||	‘The king Ambarīṣa,  though he had dwelt in the forest, went back to the city, surrounded by his children; so too Rāma, seeing the earth oppressed by the base, came forth from his hermitage and ruled it again.
tathaiva śālvādhipatirdrumākṣo vanātsasūnuḥ svapuraṃ praviśya | brahmarṣibhūtaśca munervaśiṣṭhāddadhre śriyaṃ sāṃkṛtiraṃtidevaḥ ||	‘So too Drumākṣa, the king of the Śālvas, came to his city from the forest with his son; and Sāṃkṛti Antideva,  after he had become a Brahmarṣi, received his royal dignity from the saint Vaśiṣṭha.’
evaṃvidhā dharmayaśaḥpradīptā vanāni hitvā bhavanānyabhīyuḥ | tasmānna doṣo 'sti gṛhaṃ praveṣṭuṃ tapovanāddharmanimittameva ||	‘Such men as these, illustrious in glory and virtue, left the forests and came back to their houses; therefore it is no sin to return from a hermitage to one’s home, if it be only for the sake of duty.’
tato vacastasya niśamya maṃtriṇaḥ priyaṃ hitaṃ caiva nṛpasya cakṣuṣaḥ | anūnamavyastamasaktamadrutaṃ dhṛtau sthito rājasuto 'bravīdvacaḥ ||	Then having heard the affectionate and loyal words of the minister, who was as the eye of the king, — firm in his resolve, the king’s son made his answer, with nothing omitted or displaced,  neither tedious  nor hasty:
ihāsti nāstīti ya eṣa saṃśayaḥ parasya vākyairna mamātra niścayaḥ | avetya tattvaṃ tapasā śamena vā svayaṃ grahīṣyāmi yadatra niścitam ||	‘This doubt whether anything exists or not, is not to be solved for me by another’s words; having determined the truth by asceticism or quietism, I will myself grasp whatever is ascertained concerning it.
na me kṣamaṃ saṃgaśataṃ hi darśanaṃ grahītumavyaktaparaṃ parāhatam | buddhaḥ parapratyayato hi ko vrajejjano 'ṃdhakāre 'ṃdha ivāṃdhadeśitaḥ ||	‘It is not for me to accept a theory which depends on the unknown and is all controverted, and which involves a hundred prepossessions; what wise man would go by another’s belief? Mankind are like the blind directed in the darkness by the blind.
adṛṣṭatattvasya sato 'pi kiṃ tu me śubhāśubhe saṃśayite śubhe matiḥ | vṛthāpi khedo 'pi varaṃ śubhātmanaḥ sukhaṃ na tattve 'pi vigarhitātmanaḥ ||	‘But even though I cannot discern the truth, yet still, if good and evil are doubted, let one’s mind be set on the good; even a toil  in vain is to be chosen by him whose soul is good, while the man of base soul has no joy even in the truth.
imaṃ tu dṛṣṭvāgamamavyavasthitaṃ yaduktamāptaistadavehi sādhviti | prahīṇadoṣatvamavehi cāptatāṃ prahīṇadoṣo hyanṛtaṃ na vakṣyati ||	‘But having seen that this “sacred tradition” is uncertain, know that that only is right which has been uttered by the trustworthy; and know that trustworthiness means the absence of faults; he who is without faults will not utter an untruth.
gṛhapraveśaṃ prati yacca me bhavānuvāca rāmaprabhṛtīn nidarśanam | na te pramāṇaṃ na hi dharmaniścayeṣvalaṃ pramāṇāya parikṣatavratāḥ ||	‘And as for what thou saidst to me in regard to my returning to my home, by alleging Rāma and others as examples, they are no authority, — for in determining duty, how canst thou quote as authorities those who have broken their vows?
tadevamapyeva ravirmahīṃ patedapi sthiratvaṃ himavān giristyajet | adṛṣṭatattvo viṣayonmukheṃdriyaḥ śrayeya na tveva gṛhān pṛthagjanaḥ ||	‘Even the sun, therefore, may fall to the earth, even the mountain Himavat may lose its firmness; but never would I return to my home as a man of the world, with no knowledge of the truth and my senses only alert for external objects.
ahaṃ viśeyaṃ jvalitaṃ hutāśanaṃ na cākṛtārthaḥ praviśeyamālayam | iti pratijñāṃ sa cakāra garvito yatheṣṭamutthāya ca nirmamo yayau ||	‘I would enter the blazing fire, but not my house with my purpose unfulfilled.’ Thus he proudly made his resolve, and rising up in accordance with it, full of disinterestedness, went his way.
tataḥ savāṣpau sacivadvijāvubhau niśamya tasya sthirameva niścayam | viṣaṇṇavaktrāvanugamya duḥkhitau śanairagatyā purameva jagmatuḥ ||	Then the minister and the Brāhman, both full of tears, having heard his firm determination, and having followed him awhile with despondent looks, and overcome with sorrow, slowly returned of necessity to the city.
tatsnehādatha nṛpateśca bhaktitastau sāpekṣaṃ pratiyayatuśca tasthatuśca | durdharṣaṃ ravimiva dīptamātmabhāsā taṃ draṣṭuṃ na hi pathi śekaturna moktum ||	Through their love for the prince and their devotion to the king, they returned, and often stopped looking back;  they could neither behold him on the road nor yet lose the sight of him, — shining in his own splendour and beyond the reach of all others, like the sun.
tau jñātuṃ paramagatergatiṃ tu tasya pracchannāṃścarapuruṣāñchucīn vidhāya | rājānaṃ priyasutalālasaṃ nu gatvā drakṣyāvaḥ kathamiti jagmatuḥ kathaṃcit ||	Having placed faithful emissaries in disguise to find out the actions of him who was the supreme refuge of all, they went on with faltering steps, saying to each other, ‘How shall we approach the king and see him, who is longing for his dear son?’
athaivamukto magadhādhipena suhṛnmukhena pratikūlamartham | svastho 'vikāraḥ kulaśaucaśuddhaḥ śauddhodanirvākyamidaṃ jagāda ||	Being thus addressed by the monarch of the Magadhas, in a hostile speech with a friendly face, self-possessed, unchanged, pure by family and personal purity, the son of Śuddhodana thus made answer:
nāścaryametadbhavato 'bhidhātuṃ jātasya haryaṃkakule viśāle | yanmitrapakṣe tava mitrakāma syādvṛttireṣā pariśuddhavṛtteḥ ||	‘This is not to be called a strange thing for thee, born as thou art in the great family whose ensign is the lion  — that by thee of pure conduct, O lover of thy friends, this line of conduct should be adopted towards him who stands as one of thy friends.
asatsu maitrī svakulānurūpā na tiṣṭhati śrīriva viklaveṣu | pūrvaiḥ kṛtāṃ prītiparaṃparābhistāmeva saṃtastu vivardhayaṃti ||	‘Amongst the bad a friendship, worthy of their family, ceases to continue (and fades) like prosperity among the faint-hearted; it is only the good who keep increasing the old friendship of their ancestors by a new succession of friendly acts.
ye cārthakṛcchreṣu bhavaṃti loke samānakāryāḥ suhṛdāṃ manuṣyāḥ | mitrāṇi tānīti paraimi buddhyā svasthasya vṛddhiṣviha ko hi na syāt ||	‘But those men who act unchangingly towards their friends in reverses of fortune, I esteem in my heart as true friends; who is not the friend of the prosperous man in his times of abundance?
evaṃ ca ye dravyamavāpya loke mitreṣu dharme ca niyojayaṃti | avāptasārāṇi dhanāni teṣāṃ bhraṣṭāni nāṃte janayaṃti tāpam ||	‘So those who, having obtained riches in the world, employ them for the sake of their friends and religion, — their wealth has real solidity, and when it perishes it produces no pain at the end.
suhṛttayā cāryatayā ca rājan vibhāvya māmeva viniścayaste | atrānuneṣyāmi suhṛttayaiva brūyāmahaṃ nottaramanyadatra ||	‘This thy determination concerning me, O king, is prompted by pure generosity and friendship;  I will meet thee courteously with simple friendship; I would not utter aught else in my reply.
ahaṃ jarāmṛtyubhayaṃ viditvā mumukṣayā dharmamimaṃ prapannaḥ | baṃdhūnpriyānaśrumukhān vihāya prāgeva kāmānaśubhasya hetūn ||	‘I, having experienced the fear of old age and death, fly to this path of religion in my desire for liberation; leaving behind my dear kindred with tears in their faces, — still more then those pleasures which are the causes of evil.
nāśīviṣebhyo 'pi tathā bibhemi naivāśanibhyo gaganāccyutebhyaḥ | na pāvakebhyo 'nilasaṃhitebhyo yathā bhayaṃ me viṣayebhya ebhyaḥ ||	‘I am not so afraid even of serpents nor of thunderbolts falling from heaven, nor of flames blown together by the wind, as I am afraid of these worldly objects.
kāmā hyanityāḥ kuśalārthacaurā riktāśca māyāsadṛśāśca loke | āśāsyamānā api mohayaṃti cittaṃ nṛṇāṃ kiṃ punarātmasaṃsthāḥ ||	‘These transient pleasures, — the robbers of our happiness and our wealth, and which float empty and like illusions through the world, — infatuate men’s minds even when they are only hoped for, — still more when they take up their abode in the soul.
kāmābhibhūtā hi na yāṃti śarma tripiṣṭape kiṃ vata martyaloke | kāmaiḥ satṛṣṇasya hi nāsti tṛptiryatheṃdhanairvātasakhasya vahneḥ ||	‘The victims of pleasure attain not to happiness even in the heaven of the gods, still less in the world of mortals; he who is athirst is never satisfied with pleasures, as the fire, the friend of the wind, with fuel.
jagatyanartho na samo 'sti kāmairmohācca teṣveva janaḥ prasaktaḥ | tattvaṃ viditvaivamanarthabhīruḥ prājñaḥ svayaṃ ko 'bhilaṣedanartham ||	‘There is no calamity in the world like pleasures, — people are devoted to them through delusion; when he once knows the truth and so fears evil, what wise man would of his own choice desire evil?
samudravastrāmapi gāmavāpya pāraṃ jigīṣaṃti mahārṇavasya | lokasya kāmairna vitṛptirasti patadbhiraṃbhobhirivārṇavasya ||	‘When they have obtained all the earth girdled by the sea, kings wish to conquer the other side of the great ocean: mankind are never satiated with pleasures, as the ocean with the waters that fall into it.
devena vṛṣṭe 'pi hiraṇyavarṣe dvīpānsamudrāṃścaturo 'pi jitvā | śakrasya cārdhāsanamapyavāpya māṃdhāturāsīdviṣayeṣvatṛptiḥ ||	‘When it had rained a golden shower from heaven, and when he had conquered the continents and the four oceans, and had even obtained the half of Śakra’s throne,  Māndhātṛ was still unsatisfied with worldly objects.
bhuktvāpi rājyaṃ divi devatānāṃ śatakratau vṛtrabhayātpranaṣṭe | darpānmahārṣīnapi vāhayitvā kāmeṣvatṛpto nahuṣaḥ papāta ||	‘Though he had enjoyed the kingdom of the gods in heaven, when Indra had concealed himself through fear of Vṛtra, and though in his pride he had made the great Ṛṣis bear his litter,  Nahuṣa fell, unsatisfied with pleasures.
aiḍaśca rājā tridivaṃ vigāhya nītvāpi devīṃ vaśamurvaśīṃ tām | lobhādṛṣibhyaḥ kanakaṃ jihīrṣurjagāma nāśaṃ viṣayeṣvatṛptaḥ ||	‘King (Purūravas) the son of Iḍā, having penetrated into the furthest heaven, and brought the goddess Urvaśī into his power, — when he wished in his greed to take away gold from the Ṛṣis  — being unsatisfied with pleasures, fell into destruction.
balermaheṃdraṃ nahuṣaṃ maheṃdrādiṃdraṃ punarye nahuṣādupeyuḥ | svarge kṣitau vā viṣayeṣu teṣu ko viśvasedbhāgyakulākuleṣu ||	‘Who would put his trust in these worldly objects, whether in heaven or in earth, unsettled as to lot or family, — which passed from Bali to Indra, and from Indra to Nahuṣa, and then again from Nahuṣa back to Indra?
cīrāṃbarā mūlaphalāṃbubhakṣā jaṭā vahaṃto 'pi bhujaṃgadīrghāḥ | yairanyakāryā munayo 'pi bhagnāḥ kaḥ kāmasaṃjñān mṛgayeta śatrūn ||	‘Who would seek these enemies bearing the name of pleasures, by whom even those sages have been overcome, who were devoted to other pursuits, whose only clothes were rags, whose food was roots, fruits, and water, and who wore their twisted locks as long as snakes?
ugrāyudhaścaugradhṛtāyudho 'pi yeṣāṃ kṛte mṛtyumavāpa bhīṣmāt | ciṃtāpi teṣāmaśivā vadhāya tadvṛttināṃ kiṃ punaravratānām ||	‘Those pleasures for whose sake even Ugrāyudha,  armed terribly as he was with his weapon, found death at Bhiṣma’s hands, — is not the mere thought of them unlucky and fatal, — still more the thought of the irreligious whose lives are spent in their service?
āsvādamalpaṃ viṣayeṣu matvā saṃyojanotkarṣamatṛptimeva | sadbhyaśca garhāṃ niyataṃ ca pāpaṃ kaḥ kāmasaṃjñaṃ viṣamāsasāda ||	‘Who that considers the paltry flavour of worldly objects, — the very height of union being only insatiety, — the blame of the virtuous, and the certain sin, — has ever drawn near this poison which is called pleasure?
kṛṣyādibhirdharmabhiranvitānāṃ kāmātmakānāṃ ca niśamya duḥkham | svāsthyaṃ ca kāmeṣvakutūhalānāṃ kāmān vihātuṃ kṣamamātmavadbhiḥ ||	‘When they hear of the miseries of those who are intent on pleasure and are devoted to worldly pursuits,  such as agriculture and the rest, and the self-content of those who are careless of pleasure, — it well befits the self-controlled to fling it away.
jñeyā vipatkāmini kāmasaṃpatsiddheṣu kāmeṣu madaṃ hyupaiti | madādakāryaṃ kurute na kāryaṃ yena kṣato durgatimabhyupaiti ||	‘Success in pleasure is to be considered a misery in the man of pleasure, for he becomes intoxicated when his desired pleasures are attained; through intoxication he does what should not be done, not what should be done; and being wounded thereby he falls into a miserable end.
yatnena labdhāḥ parirakṣitāśca ye vipralabhya pratiyāṃti bhūyaḥ | teṣvātmavān yācitakopameṣu kāmeṣu vidvāniha ko rameta ||	‘These pleasures which are gained and kept by toil, — which after deceiving leave you and return whence they came, — these pleasures which are but borrowed for a time,  what man of self-control, if he is wise, would delight in them?
anviṣya cādāya ca jātatarṣā yānatyajaṃtaḥ pariyāṃti duḥkham | loke tṛṇolkāsadṛśeṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these pleasures which are like a torch of hay, — which excite thirst when you seek them and when you grasp them, and which they who abandon not keep only as misery?
anātmavaṃto hṛdi yairvidaṣṭā vināśamarchaṃti na yāṃti śarma | kruddhaugrasarpapratimeṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘Those men of no self-control who are bitten by them in their hearts, fall into ruin and attain not bliss, — what man of self-control could find satisfaction in these pleasures, which are like an angry, cruel serpent?
asthi kṣudhārttā iva sārameyā bhuktvāpi yānnaiva bhavaṃti tṛptāḥ | jīrṇāsthikaṃkālasameṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘Even if they enjoy them men are not satisfied, like dogs famishing with hunger over a bone, — what man of self-control could find satisfaction in these pleasures, which are like a skeleton composed of dry bones?
ye rājacaurodakapāvakebhyaḥ sādhāraṇatvājjanayaṃti duḥkham | teṣu praviddhāmiṣasaṃnibheṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these pleasures which are like flesh that has been flung away, and which produce misery by their being held only in common with kings, thieves, water, and fire?
yatra sthitānāmabhito vipattiḥ śatroḥ sakāśādapi bāṃdhavebhyaḥ | hiṃsreṣu teṣvāyatanopameṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these pleasures, which, like the senses,  are destructive, and which bring calamity on every hand to those who abide in them, from the side of friends even more than from open enemies?
girau vane cāpsu ca sāgare ca yadbhraṃśamarchaṃtyabhilaṃghamānāḥ | teṣu drumaprāgraphalopameṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures, which are like the fruit that grows on the top of a tree, — which those who would leap up to reach fall down upon a mountain or into a forest, waters, or the ocean?
tīrthaiḥ prayatnairvividhairavāptāḥ kṣaṇena ye nāśamiha prayāṃti |  svapnopabhogapratimeṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt |	‘What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures, which are like snatching up a hot coal, — men never attain happiness, however they pursue them, increase them, or guard them?
yānarcayitvāpi na yāṃti śarma vivardhayitvā paripālayitvā | aṃgārakarṣapratimeṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures, which are like the enjoyments in a dream, — which are gained by their recipients after manifold pilgrimages and labours, and then perish in a moment?

suṃdopasuṃdāvasurau yadarthamanyonyavairaprasṛtau vinaṣṭau | sauhārdaviśleṣakareṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which dissolve friendships and for the sake of which the two Asuras Sunda and Upasunda perished, victims engaged in mutual enmity?
kāmāṃdhasaṃjñāḥ kṛpayā va ke ca kravyātsu nātmānamihotsṛjaṃti | sapatnabhūteṣvaśiveṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt ||	‘None, however their intellect is blinded with pleasure, give themselves up, as in compassion, to ravenous beasts;  so what man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which are disastrous and constant enemies?
kāmāṃdhasaṃjñaḥ kṛpaṇaṃ karoti prāpnoti duḥkhaṃ vadhabaṃdhanādi | kāmārthamāśākṛpaṇastapasvī mṛtyuśramaṃ cārhati jīvaloke ||	‘He whose intellect is blinded with pleasure does pitiable things; he incurs calamities, such as death, bonds, and the like; the wretch, who is the miserable slave of hope for the sake of pleasure, well deserves the pain of death even in the world of the living.
gītairhriyaṃte hi mṛgā vadhāya rūpārthamagnau śalabhāḥ pataṃti | matsyo giratyāyasamāmiṣārthī tasmādanarthaṃ viṣayāḥ phalaṃti ||	‘Deer are lured to their destruction by songs,  insects for the sake of the brightness fly into the fire, the fish greedy for the flesh swallows the iron hook, — therefore worldly objects produce misery as their end.
kāmāstu bhogā iti yanmataṃ syādbhogyā na kecitparigaṇyamānāḥ | vastrādayo dravyaguṇā hi loke duḥkhapratīkāra iti pradhāryāḥ ||	‘As for the common opinion, “pleasures are enjoyments,” none of them when examined are worthy of being enjoyed; fine garments and the rest are only the accessories of things, — they are to be regarded as merely the remedies for pain.
iṣṭaṃ hi tarṣapraśamāya toyaṃ kṣunnāśahetoraśanaṃ tathaiva | vātātapāṃbvāvaraṇāya veśma kaupīnaśītāvaraṇāya vāsaḥ ||	‘Water is desired for allaying thirst; food in the same way for removing hunger; a house for keeping off the wind, the heat of the sun, and the rain; and dress for keeping off the cold and to cover one’s nakedness.
nidrāvighātāya tathaiva śayyā yānaṃ tathādhvaśramanāśanāya | tathāsanaṃ sthānavinodanāya snānaṃ mṛjārogyabalāśrayāya ||	‘So too a bed is for removing drowsiness; a carriage for remedying the fatigue of a journey; a seat for alleviating the pain of standing; so bathing as a means for washing, health, and strength.
duḥkhapratīkāranimittabhūtāstasmātprajānāṃ viṣayā na bhogyāḥ | aśnāmi bhogāniti ko 'bhyupeyātprājñaḥ pratīkāravidhau pravṛttān ||	‘External objects therefore are to human beings means for remedying pain, not in themselves sources of enjoyment; what wise man would allow that he enjoys those delights which are only used as remedial?
yaḥ pittadāhena vidahyamānaḥ śītakriyāṃ bhoga iti vyavasyet | duḥkhapratīkāravidhau pravṛttaḥ kāmeṣu kuryātsa hi bhogasaṃjñām ||	‘He who, when burned with the heat of bilious fever, maintains that cold appliances are an enjoyment, when he is only engaged in alleviating pain, — he indeed might give the name of enjoyment to pleasures.
kāmeṣvanaikāṃtikatā ca yasmādato 'pi me teṣu na bhogasaṃjñā | ya eva bhāvā hi sukhaṃ diśaṃti ta eva duḥkhaṃ punarāvahaṃti ||	‘Since variableness is found in all pleasures, I cannot apply to them the name of enjoyment; the very conditions which mark pleasure, bring also in its turn pain.
gurūṇi vāsāṃsyagurūṇi caiva sukhāya śīte hyasukhāya gharme | caṃdrāṃśavaścaṃdanameva coṣṇe sukhāya duḥkhāya bhavaṃti śīte ||	‘Heavy garments and fragrant aloe-wood are pleasant in the cold, but an annoyance in the heat;  and the moonbeams and sandal-wood are pleasant in the heat, but a pain in the cold.
dvaṃdvāni sarvasya yataḥ prasaktānyalābhalābhaprabhṛtīni loke | ato 'pi naikāṃtasukho 'sti kaścinnaikāṃtaduḥkhaḥ puruṣaḥ prṭhivyām ||	‘Since the well-known opposite pairs,  such as gain and loss and the rest, are inseparably connected with everything in this world, — therefore no man is invariably happy on the earth nor invariably wretched.
dṛṣṭvā ca miśrāṃ sukhaduḥkatāṃ me rājyaṃ ca dāsyaṃ ca mataṃ samānam | nityaṃ hasatyeva hi naiva rājā na cāpi saṃtapyata eva dāsaḥ ||	‘When I see how the nature of pleasure and pain are mixed, I consider royalty and slavery as the same; a king does not always smile, nor is a slave always in pain.
ājñā nṛpatve 'bhyadhiketi yasmātmahāṃti duḥkhānyata eva rājñaḥ | āsaṃgakāṣṭhapratimo hi rājā lokasya hetoḥ parikhedameti ||	‘Since to be a king involves a wider range of command, therefore the pains of a king are great; for a king is like a peg,  — he endures trouble for the sake of the world.
rājye nṛpastyāgini vaṃkamitre viśvāsamāgacchati cedvipannaḥ | athāpi viśraṃbhamupaiti neha kiṃ nāma saukhyaṃ cakitasya rājñaḥ ||	‘A king is unfortunate, if he places his trust in his royalty which is apt to desert and loves crooked turns;  and on the other hand, if he does not trust in it, then what can be the happiness of a timid king?
yadā ca jitvāpi mahīṃ samagrāṃ vāsāya dṛṣṭaṃ puramekameva | tatrāpi caikaṃ bhavanaṃ niṣevyaṃ śramaḥ parārthe nanu rājabhāvaḥ ||	‘And since after even conquering the whole earth, one city only can serve as a dwelling-place, and even there only one house can be inhabited, is not royalty mere labour for others?
rājyo 'pi vāse yugamekameva kṣutsaṃnirodhāya tathānnamātrā | śayyā tathaikāsanamekameva śeṣā viśeṣā nṛpatermadāya ||	‘And even in royal clothing one pair of garments is all he needs, and just enough food to keep off hunger; so only one bed, and only one seat; all a king’s other distinctions are only for pride.
tuṣṭyarthametacca phalaṃ yadīṣṭamṛte 'pi rājyānmama tuṣṭirasti | tuṣṭau ca satyāṃ puruṣasya loke sarve viśeṣā nanu nirviśeṣāḥ ||	‘And if all these fruits are desired for the sake of satisfaction, I can be satisfied without a kingdom; and if a man is once satisfied in this world, are not all distinctions indistinguishable?
tannāsti kāmān prati saṃpratāryaḥ kṣeme śivaṃ mārgamanuprapannaḥ | smṛtvā suhṛttvaṃ tu punaḥ punarmāṃ brūhi pratijñāṃ khalu pālayaṃti ||	‘He then who has attained the auspicious road to happiness is not to be deceived in regard to pleasures; remembering thy professed friendship, tell me again and again, do they keep their promise?
na hyasmyamarṣeṇa vanapraviṣṭo na śatrubāṇairavadhūtamauliḥ | kṛtaspṛho nāpi phalādhikebhyo gṛhṇāmi naitadvacanaṃ yataste ||	‘I have not repaired to the forest through anger, nor because my diadem has been dashed down by an enemy’s arrows; nor have I set my desires on loftier objects,  that I thus refuse thy proposal.
yo daṃdaśūkaṃ kupitaṃ bhujaṃgaṃ muktvā vyavasyeddhi punargrahītum | dāhātmikāṃ vā jvalitāṃ tṛṇaulkāṃ saṃtyajya kāmānsa punarbhajeta ||	‘Only he who, having once let go a malignant incensed serpent, or a blazing hay-torch all on fire, would strive again to seize it, would ever seek pleasures again after having once abandoned them.
aṃdhāya yaśca spṛhayedanaṃdho baddhāya mukto vidhanāya vāḍhyaḥ | unmattacittāya ca kalyacittaḥ spṛhāṃ sa kuryādviṣayātmakāya ||	‘Only he who, though seeing, would envy the blind, though free the bound, though wealthy the destitute, though sound in his reason the maniac, — only he, I say, would envy one who is devoted to worldly objects.
bhikṣopabhogī vara nānukaṃpyaḥ kṛtī jarāmṛtyubhayaṃ titīrṣuḥ | ihottamaṃ śāṃtisukhaṃ ca yasya paratra duḥkhāni ca saṃvṛtāni ||	‘He who lives on alms, my good friend, is not to be pitied, having gained his end and being set on escaping the fear of old age and death; he has here the best happiness, perfect calm, and hereafter all pains are for him abolished.
lakṣmyāṃ mahatyāmapi vartamānastṛṣṇābhibhūtastvanukaṃpitavyaḥ | prāpnoti yaḥ śāṃtisukhaṃ na ceha paratra duḥkhaṃ pratigṛhyate ca ||	‘But he is to be pitied who is overpowered by thirst though set in the midst of great wealth, — who attains not the happiness of calm here, while pain has to be experienced hereafter.
evaṃ tu vaktuṃ bhavato 'nurūpaṃ sattvasya vṛttasya kulasya caiva | mamāpi voḍhuṃ sadṛśaṃ pratijñāṃ sattvasya vṛttasya kulasya caiva ||	‘Thus to speak to me is well worthy of thy character, thy mode of life, and thy family; and to carry out my resolve is also befitting my character, my mode of life, and my family.
ahaṃ hi saṃsārarasena viddho viniḥsṛtaḥ śāṃtamavāptukāmaḥ | neccheyamāptuṃ tridive 'pi rājyaṃ nirāmayaṃ kiṃ vata mānuṣeṣu ||	‘I have been wounded by the enjoyment of the world, and I have come out longing to obtain peace; I would not accept an empire free from all ill even in the third heaven, how much less amongst men?
trivargasevāṃ nṛpa yattu kṛtsnataḥ paro manuṣyārtha iti tvamāttha mām | anartha ityāttha mamārthadarśanaṃ kṣayī trivargo hi na cāpi tarpakaḥ ||	‘But as for what thou saidst to me, O king, that the universal pursuit of the three objects is the supreme end of man, — and  thou saidst that what I regard as the desirable is misery, — thy three objects are perishable and also unsatisfying.
pade tu yasminna jarā na bhīrutā na janma naivoparamo na vādhayaḥ | tameva manye puruṣārthamuttamaṃ na vidyate yatra punaḥ punaḥ kriyā ||	‘But that world in which there is no old age nor fear, no birth, nor death, nor anxieties,  that alone I consider the highest end of man, where there is no ever-renewed action.
yadapyavocaḥ paripālyatāṃ jarā navaṃ vayo gacchati vikriyāmiti | aniścayo 'yaṃ capalaṃ hi dṛśyate jarāpyadhīrā dhṛtimacca yauvanam ||	‘And as for what thou saidst “wait till old age comes, for youth is ever subject to change;” — this want of decision is itself uncertain; for age too can be irresolute and youth can be firm.
svakarmadakṣaśca yadā tu ko jagadvayaḥsu sarveṣu ca saṃvikarṣati | vināśakāle kathamavyavasthite jarā pratīkṣyā viduṣā śamepsunā ||	‘But since Fate  is so well skilled in its art as to draw the world in all its various ages into its power, — how shall the wise man, who desires tranquillity, wait for old age, when he knows not when the time of death will be?
jarāyudho vyādhivikīrṇasāyako yadāṃtako vyādha ivāśritaḥ sthitaḥ | prajāmṛgān bhāgyavanāśritāṃstudan vayaḥprakarṣaṃ prati ko manorathaḥ ||	‘When death stands ready like a hunter, with old age as his weapon, and diseases scattered about as his arrows, smiting down living creatures who fly like deer to the forest of destiny, what desire can there be in any one for length of life?
suto yuvā vā sthaviro 'thavā śiśustathā tvarāvāniha kartumarhati | yathā bhaveddharmavataḥ kṛpātmanaḥ pravṛttiriṣṭā vinivṛttireva vā ||	‘It well befits the youthful son or the old man or the child so to act with all promptitude that they may choose the action of the religious man whose soul is all mercy, — nay, better still, his inactivity.
yadāttha vā dīptaphalāṃ kulocitāṃ kuruṣva dharmāya makhakriyāmiti | namo makhebhyo na hi kāmaye sukhaṃ parasya duḥkhakriyayāpadiśyate ||	‘And as for what thou saidst, “be diligent in sacrifices for religion, such as are worthy of thy race and bring a glorious fruit,” — honour to such sacrifices! I desire not that fruit which is sought by causing pain to others!
paraṃ hi haṃtuṃ vivaśaṃ phalepsayā na yuktarūpaṃ karuṇātmanaḥ sataḥ | kratoḥ phalaṃ yadyapi śāśvataṃ bhavet tathāpi kṛtvā kimupakṣayātmakam ||	‘To kill a helpless victim through a wish for future reward, — it would be an unseemly action for a merciful-hearted good man, even if the reward of the sacrifice were eternal; but what if, after all, it is subject to decay?
bhavecca dharmo yadi nāparo vidhirvratena śīlena manaḥśamena vā | tathāpi naivārhati sevituṃ kratuṃ viśasya yasmin paramucyate phalam ||	‘And even if true religion did not consist in quite another rule of conduct, by self-restraint, moral practice and a total absence of passion, — still it would not be seemly to follow the rule of sacrifice, where the highest reward is described as attained only by slaughter.
ihāpi tāvatpuruṣasya tiṣṭhataḥ pravartate yatparahiṃsayā sukham | tadapyaniṣṭaṃ saghṛṇasya dhīmato bhavāṃtare kiṃ vata yanna dṛśyate ||	‘Even that happiness which comes to a man, while he stays in this world, through the injury of another, is hateful to the wise compassionate heart; how much more if it be something beyond our sight in another life?
na ca pratāryo 'smi phalapravṛttaye bhaveṣu rājan ramate na me manaḥ | latā ivāṃbhodharavṛṣṭitāḍitāḥ pravṛttayaḥ sarvagatā hi caṃcalā ||	‘I am not to be lured into a course of action for future reward, — my mind does not delight, O king, in future births; these actions are uncertain and wavering in their direction, like plants beaten by the rain from a cloud.
ihāgataścāhamito didṛkṣayā munerarāḍasya vimokṣavādinaḥ | prayāmi cādyaiva nṛpāstu te śivaṃ vacaḥ kṣamethāḥ śamatattvaniṣṭhuram ||	‘I have come here with a wish to see next the seer Arāḍa who proclaims liberation; I start this very day, — happiness be to thee, O king; forgive my words which may seem harsh through their absolute freedom from passion.
atheṃdravaddivyava śaśvadarkavadguṇairava śreya ihāva gāmava | avāyurāryairava satsutān ava śriyaśca rājannava dharmamātmanaḥ ||	 ‘Now therefore do thou guard (the world) like Indra in heaven; guard it continually like the sun by thy excellencies; guard its best happiness here; guard the earth; guard life by the noble;  guard the sons of the good; guard thy royal powers, O king; and guard thine own religion.
himāriketūdbhavasaṃplavāṃtare yathā dvijo yāti vimokṣayaṃstanum | himāriśatruṃ kṣayaśatrughātinastathāṃtare yāhi vimocayanmanaḥ ||	‘As in the midst of a sudden catastrophe arising from the flame of (fire), the enemy of cold, a bird, to deliver its body, betakes itself to the enemy of fire (water), — so do thou, when occasion calls, betake thyself, to deliver thy mind, to those who will destroy the enemies of thy home.’
nṛpo 'bravītsāṃjalirāgataspṛho yatheṣṭamāpnoti bhavānavighnataḥ | avāpya kāle kṛtakṛtyatāmimāṃ mamāpi kāryo bhavatā tvanugrahaḥ ||	The king himself, folding his hands, with a sudden longing come upon him, replied, ‘Thou art obtaining thy desire without hindrance; when thou hast at last accomplished all that thou hast to do, thou shalt show hereafter thy favour towards me.’
sthiraṃ pratijñāya tatheti pārthive tataḥ sa vaiśvaṃtaramāśramaṃ yayau | parivrajaṃtaṃ samudīkṣya vismito nṛpo 'pi ca prāpurimaṃ giriṃ vrajan ||	Having given his firm promise to the monarch, he proceeded to the Vaiśvantara hermitage; and, after watching him with astonishment, as he wandered on in his course, the king and  his courtiers returned to the mountain (of Rājagiri).
sa tathā viṣayairvilobhyamānaḥ paramohairapi śākyarājasūnuḥ | na jagāma ratiṃ na śarma lebhe hṛdaye siṃha ivātidigdhaviddhaḥ ||	He, the son of the Śākya king, even though thus tempted by the objects of sense which infatuate others, yielded not to pleasure and felt not delight, like a lion deeply pierced in his heart by a poisoned arrow.
atha maṃtrisutaiḥ kṣamaiḥ kadācitsakhibhiścitrakathaiḥ kṛtānuyātraḥ | vanabhūmididṛkṣayā śamepsurnaradevānumato vahiḥ pratasthe ||	Then one day accompanied by some worthy sons of his father’s ministers, friends full of varied converse, — with a desire to see the glades of the forest and longing for peace, he went out with the king’s permission.
navarukmakhalīnakiṃkiṇīkaṃ pracalaccāmaracāruhemabhāṃḍam | abhiruhya sa kaṃṭhakaṃ sadaśvaṃ prayayau ketumiva drumābjaketuḥ ||	Having mounted his good horse Kaṃthaka, decked with bells and bridle-bit of new gold, with beautiful golden harness and the chowrie waving,  he went forth like the moon  mounted on a comet.
sa nikṛṣṭatarāṃ vanāṃtabhūmiṃ vanalobhācca yayau mahīguṇecchuḥ | salilormivikārasīramārgāṃ vasudhāṃ caiva dadarśa kṛṣyamāṇām ||	Lured by love of the wood and longing for the beauties of the ground,  he went to a spot near at hand  on the forest-outskirts; and there he saw a piece of land being ploughed, with the path of the plough broken like waves on the water.
halabhinnavikīrṇaśaṣpadarbhāṃ hatasūkṣmakrimikāṃḍajaṃtukīrṇām | samavekṣya rasāṃ tathāvidhāṃ tāṃ svajanasyeva badhe bhṛśaṃ śuśoca ||	Having beheld the ground in this condition, with its young grass scattered and torn by the plough, and covered with the eggs and young of little insects which were killed, he was filled with deep sorrow as for the slaughter of his own kindred.
kṛṣataḥ puruṣāṃśca vīkṣamāṇaḥ pavanārkāṃśurajovibhinnavarṇān | vahanaklamaviklavāṃśca dhuryān paramāryaḥ paramāṃ kṛpāṃ cakāra ||	And beholding the men as they were ploughing, their complexions spoiled by the dust, the sun’s rays, and the wind, and their cattle bewildered with the burden of drawing, the most noble one felt extreme compassion.
avatīrya tatasturaṃgapṛṣṭhācchanakairgāṃ vyacarat śucā parītaḥ | jagato jananavyayaṃ vicinvan kṛpaṇaṃ khalvidamityuvāca cārttaḥ ||	Having alighted from the back of his horse, he went over the ground slowly, overcome with sorrow, — pondering the birth and destruction of the world, he, grieved, exclaimed, ‘this is indeed pitiable.’
manasā ca viviktatāmabhīpsuḥ suhṛdastānanuyāyino nivārya | abhitāralacāruparṇavatyā vijane mūlamupeyivān sa jaṃbvāḥ ||	Then desiring to become perfectly lonely in his thoughts, having stopped those friends who were following him, he went to the root of a rose-apple in a solitary spot, which had its beautiful leaves all tremulous (in the wind).
niṣasāda ca patrakhoravatyāṃ bhuvi vaidūryanikāśaśādvalāyām | jagataḥ prabhavavyayau viciṃtya manasaśca sthitimārgamālalaṃbe ||	There he sat down on the ground covered with leaves,  and with its young grass bright like lapis lazuli; and, meditating on the origin and destruction of the world, he laid hold of the path that leads to firmness of mind.
samavāptamanaḥ sthitiśca sadyo viṣayecchādibhirādhibhiśca muktaḥ | savitarkavicāramāpa śāṃtaṃ prathamaṃ dhyānamanāśravaprakāram ||	Having attained to firmness of mind,  and being forthwith set free from all sorrows such as the desire of worldly objects and the rest, he attained the first stage of contemplation, unaffected by sin, calm, and ‘argumentative.’
adhigamya tato vivekajaṃ tu paramaprītisukhaṃ [manaḥ] samādhim | idameva tataḥ paraṃ pradadhyau manasā lokagatiṃ niśamya samyak ||	Having then obtained the highest happiness sprung from deliberation,  he next pondered this meditation, — having thoroughly understood in his mind the course of the world:
kṛpaṇaṃ vata yajjanaḥ svayaṃ sannaraso vyādhijarāvināśadharmaḥ | jarayārditamāturaṃ mṛtaṃ vā paramajño vijugupsate madāṃdhaḥ ||	‘It is a miserable thing that mankind, though themselves powerless  and subject to sickness, old age, and death, yet, blinded by passion and ignorant, look with disgust on another who is afflicted by old age or diseased or dead.
iha cedahamīdṛśaḥ svayaṃ san vijugupseya paraṃ tathāsvabhāvam | na bhavetsadṛśaṃ hi tatkṣamaṃ vā paramaṃ dharmamimaṃ vijānato me ||	‘If I here, being such myself, should feel disgust for another who has such a nature, it would not be worthy or right in me who know this highest duty.’
iti tasya vipaśyato yathāvajjagato vyādhijarāvipattidoṣān | balayauvanajīvitapravṛttau vijagāmātmagato madaḥ kṣaṇena ||	As he thus considered thoroughly these faults of sickness, old age, and death which belong to all living beings, all the joy which he had felt in the activity of his vigour, his youth, and his life, vanished in a moment.
na jaharṣa na cāpi cānutepe vicikitsāṃ na yayau na taṃdrinidre | na ca kāmaguṇeṣu saṃraraṃje na ca didveṣa paraṃ na cāvamene ||	He did not rejoice, he did not feel remorse; he suffered no hesitation, indolence, nor sleep; he felt no drawing towards the qualities of desire; he hated not nor scorned another.
iti buddhiriyaṃ ca nīrajaskā vavṛdhe tasya mahātmano viśuddhā | puruṣairaparairadṛśyamānaḥ puruṣaścopasasarpa bhikṣuveśaḥ ||	Thus did this pure passionless meditation grow within the great-souled one; and unobserved by the other men, there crept up a man in a beggar’s dress.
naradevasutastamabhyapṛcchadvada ko 'sīti śaśaṃsa so 'tha tasmai | sa ca puṃgava janmamṛtyubhītaḥ śramaṇaḥ pravrajito 'smi mokṣahetoḥ ||	The king’s son asked him a question, — he said to him, ‘Tell me, who art thou?’ and the other replied, ‘Oh bull of men, I, being terrified at birth and death, have become an ascetic for the sake of liberation.
jagati kṣayadharmake mumukṣurmṛgaye 'haṃ śivamakṣayaṃ padaṃ tat | ajano 'nyajanairatulyabuddhirviṣayebhyo vinivṛttarāgadoṣaḥ ||	‘Desiring liberation in a world subject to destruction, I seek that happy indestructible abode, isolated from mankind, with my thoughts unlike those of others, and with my sinful passions turned away from all objects of sense.
nivasan kvacideva vṛkṣamūle vijane vāyatane girau vane vā | vicarāmyaparigraho nirāśaḥ paramārthāya yathopapannabhikṣuḥ ||	‘Dwelling anywhere, at the root of a tree, or in an uninhabited house, a mountain or a forest, — I wander without a family and without hope, a beggar ready for any fare, seeking only the highest good.’
iti paśyata eva rājasūnoridamuktvā sa nabhaḥ samutpapāta | sa hi tadvapuranyabuddhidarśī smṛtaye tasya sameyivān divaukāḥ ||	When he had thus spoken, while the prince was looking on, he suddenly flew up to the sky; it was a heavenly inhabitant who, knowing that the prince’s thoughts were other than what his outward form promised, had come to him for the sake of rousing his recollection.
gaganaṃ khagavadgate ca tasmin nṛvaraḥ saṃjahṛṣe visismiye ca | upalabhya tataśca dharmasaṃjñāmabhiniryāṇavidhau matiṃ cakāra ||	When the other was gone like a bird to heaven, the foremost of men was rejoiced and astonished; and having comprehended the meaning of the term dharma,  he set his mind on the manner of the accomplishment of deliverance.
tata iṃdrasamo jiteṃdriyaśca pravivikṣuḥ paramāśvamāruroha | parivartya janaṃ tvavekṣamāṇastata evābhimataṃ vanaṃ na bheje ||	Then like Indra himself, and having tamed his senses, — desiring to return home he mounted his noble steed; and having made him turn back as he looked for his friends, from that moment he sought no more the desired forest.
sa jarāmaraṇakṣayaṃ cikīrṣurvanavāsāya matiṃ smṛtau nidhāya | praviveśa punaḥ puraṃ na kāmādvanabhūmeriva maṃḍalaṃ dvipeṃdraḥ ||	Ever seeking to make an end of old age and death, fixing his thoughts in memory on dwelling in the woods, he entered the city again but with no feelings of longing, like an elephant entering an exercise-ground  after roaming in a forest-land.
sukhitā vata nirvṛtā ca sā strī patirīdṛktvamivāyatākṣa yasyāḥ | iti taṃ samudīkṣya rājakanyā praviśaṃtaṃ pathi sāṃjalirjagāda ||	‘Happy truly and blessed is that woman whose husband is such as thou, O long-eyed prince!’ So, on seeing him, the princess exclaimed, folding her hands to welcome him, as he entered the road.
atha ghoṣamimaṃ mahābhraghoṣaḥ pariśuśrāva śamaṃ paraṃ ca lebhe | śrutavāṃśca hi nirvṛteti śabdaṃ parinirvāṇavidhau matiṃ cakāra ||	He whose voice was deep-sounding like a cloud heard this address and was filled with profound calm; and as he heard the word ‘blessed’  he fixed his mind on the attainment of Nirvāṇa.
atha kāṃcanaśailaśṛṃgavarṣmā gajamegharṣabhabāhunisvanākṣaḥ | kṣayamakṣayadharmajātarāgaḥ śaśisiṃhānanavikramaḥ prapede ||	Then the prince whose form was like the peak of a golden mountain, — whose eye, voice, and arm resembled a bull, a cloud, and an elephant,  — whose countenance and prowess were like the moon and a lion, — having a longing aroused for something imperishable, — went into his palace.
mṛgarājagatistato 'bhyagacchannṛpatiṃ maṃtrigaṇairupāsyamānam | samitau marutāmiva jvalaṃtaṃ maghavaṃtaṃ tridive sanatkumāraḥ ||	Then stepping like a lion he went towards the king who was attended by his numerous counsellors, like Sanatkumāra in heaven waiting on Indra resplendent in the assembly  of the Maruts.
praṇipatya ca sāṃjalirbabhāṣe diśa mahyaṃ naradeva sādhvanujñām | parivivrajiṣāmi mokṣahetorniyato hyasya janasya viprayogaḥ ||	Prostrating himself, with folded hands, he addressed him, ‘Grant me graciously thy permission, O lord of men, — I wish to become a wandering mendicant for the sake of liberation, since separation is appointed for me.’
iti tasya vaco niśamya rājā kariṇevābhihato drumaścacāla | kamalapratime 'ṃjalau gṛhītvā vacanaṃ cedamuvāca vāṣpakaṃṭhaḥ ||	Having heard his words, the king shook like a tree struck by an elephant, and having seized his folded hands which were like a lotus, he thus addressed him in a voice choked with tears:
pratisaṃhara tāta buddhimetāṃ na hi kālastava dharmasaṃśrayasya | vayasi prathame matau calāyāṃ bahudoṣāṃ hi vadaṃti dharmacaryām ||	‘O my son, keep back this thought, it is not the time for thee to betake thyself to dharma; they say that the practice of religion is full of evils in the first period of life when the mind is still fickle.
viṣayeṣu kutūhaleṃdriyasya vratakhedeṣvasamarthaniścayasya | taruṇasya manaścalatyaraṇyādanabhijñasya viśeṣato 'vivekam ||	‘The mind of the thoughtless ignorant young man whose senses are eager for worldly objects, and who has no power of settled resolution for the hardships of vows of penance, shrinks back from the forest, for it is especially destitute of discrimination.
mama tu priyadharma dharmakālastvayi lakṣmīmavasṛjya lakṣyabhūte | sthiravikrama vikrameṇa dharmastava hitvā tu guruṃ bhavedadharmaḥ ||	‘It is high time for me to practise religion, O my child of loved qualities,  leaving my royal glory to thee who art well worthy to be distinguished by it; but thy religion, O firm-striding hero, is to be accomplished by heroism; it would be irreligion if thou wert to leave thine own father.
tadimaṃ vyavasāyamutsṛja tvaṃ bhava tāvannirato gṛhasthadharme | puruṣasya vayaḥsukhāni bhuktvā ramaṇīyo hi tapovanapraveśaḥ ||	‘Do thou therefore abandon this thy resolution; devote thyself for the present to the duties of a householder; to a man who has enjoyed the pleasures of his prime, it is delightful to enter the penance-forest.’
iti vākyamidaṃ niśamya rājñaḥ kalaviṃkasvara uttaraṃ babhāṣe | yadi me pratibhūścaturṣu rājan bhavasi tvaṃ na tapovanaṃ śrayiṣye ||	Having heard these words of the king, he made his reply in a voice soft like a sparrow’s: ‘If thou wilt be my surety, O king, against four contingencies, I will not betake myself to the forest.
na bhavenmaraṇāya jīvitaṃ me viharetsvāsthyamidaṃ ca me na rogaḥ | na ca yauvanamākṣipejjarā me na ca saṃpattimapāharedvipattiḥ ||	‘Let not my life be subject to death, and let not disease impair this health of mine; let not old age attack my youth, and let not misfortune destroy my weal.’
iti durlabhamarthamūcivāṃsaṃ tanayaṃ vākyamuvāca śākyarājaḥ | tyaja buddhimatimāṃ gatipravṛttāmavahāsyo 'timanorathakramaśca ||	When his son uttered a speech so hard to be understood, the king of the Śākyas thus replied: ‘Abandon this idea bent upon departure; extravagant desires are only ridiculous.’
atha merugururguruṃ babhāṣe yadi nāsti krama eṣa nāsti vāryaḥ | śaraṇājjvalanena dahyamānānna hi niścikramiṣuṃ kṣamaṃ grahītum ||	Then he who was firm as Mount Meru addressed his father: ‘If this is impossible, then this course of mine is not to be hindered; it is not right to lay hold of one who would escape  from a house that is on fire.
jagataśca yathā dhruvo viyogo na tu dharmāya varaṃ tvayaṃ viyogaḥ | avaśaṃ nanu viprayojayenmāmakṛtasvārthamatṛptameva mṛtyuḥ ||	‘As separation is inevitable to the world, but not for Dharma,  this separation is preferable; will not death sever me helplessly, my objects unattained and myself unsatisfied?’
iti bhūmipatirniśamya tasya vyavasāyaṃ tanayasya nirmumukṣoḥ | abhidhāya na yāsyatīti bhūyo vidadhe rakṣaṇamuttamāṃśca kāmān ||	The monarch, having heard this resolve of his son longing for liberation, and having again exclaimed, ‘He shall not go,’ set guards round him and the highest pleasures.
sacivaistu nidarśito yathāvadbahumānāt praṇayācca śāstrapūrvam | guruṇā ca nivārito 'śrupātaiḥ praviveśāvasathaṃ tataḥ sa śocan ||	Then having been duly instructed  by the counsellors, with all respect and affection, according to the śāstras, and being thus forbidden with tears by his father, the prince, sorrowing, entered into his palace.
calakuṇdalacuṃbitānanābhirghananiśvāsavikaṃpitastanībhiḥ | vanitābhiradhīralocanābhirmṛgaśāvābhirivābhyudīkṣyamāṇaḥ ||	There he was gazed at by his wives with restless eyes, whose faces were kissed by their dangling earrings, and whose bosoms were shaken with their thick-coming sighs, — as by so many young fawns.
sa hi kāṃcanaparvatāvadāto hṛdayonmādakaro varāṃganānām | śravanāṃgavilocanātmabhāvān vacanasparśavapurguṇairjahāra ||	Bright like a golden mountain, and bewitching the hearts of the noble women, he enraptured their ears, limbs, eyes, and souls by his speech, touch, form, and qualities.
vigate divase tato vimānaṃ vapuṣā sūrya iva pradīpyamānaḥ | timiraṃ vijighāṃsurātmabhāsā ravirudyanniva merumāruroha ||	When the day was gone, then, shining with his form like the sun, he ascended the palace, as the rising sun ascends Mount Meru, desiring to dispel the darkness by his own splendour.
kanakojjvaladīptadīpavṛkṣaṃ varakālāgurudhūpapūrṇagarbham | adhiruhya sa vajrabhakticitraṃ pravaraṃ kāṃcanamāsanaṃ siṣeve ||	Having ascended, he repaired to a special golden seat decorated with embellishments of diamond, with tall lighted candlesticks ablaze with gold, and its interior filled with the incense of black aloe-wood.
tata uttamamuttamāśca nāryo niśi tūryairupatasthuriṃdrakalpam | himavacchirasīva caṃdragaure draviṇeṃdrātmajamapsarogaṇaughāḥ ||	Then the noblest of women waited during the night on the noblest of men who was like Indra himself, with a concert of musical instruments, as the crowds of heavenly nymphs wait on the son of the Lord of wealth  upon the summit of Himavat, white like the moon.
paramairapi divyatūryakalpaiḥ sa tu tairnaiva ratiṃ yayau na harṣam | paramārthasukhāya tasya sādhorabhiniścikramiṣā yato na reme ||	But even by those beautiful instruments like heavenly music he was not moved to pleasure or delight; since his desire to go forth from his home to seek the bliss of the highest end was never lulled.
atha tatra suraistapovariṣṭhairakaniṣṭhairvyavasāyamasya buddhvā | yugapatpramadājanasya nidrā vihitāsīdvikṛtāśca gātraceṣṭāḥ ||	Then by the power of the heavenly beings most excellent in self-mortification, the Akaniṣṭhas, who knew the purpose of his heart, deep sleep was suddenly thrown on that company of women and their limbs and gestures became distorted.
abhavacchayitā hi tatra kācidviniveśya pracale kare kapolam | dayitāmapi rukmapattracitrāṃ kupitevāṃkagatāṃ vihāya vīṇām ||	One was lying there, resting her cheek on her trembling arm; leaving as in anger her lute, though dearly loved, which lay on her side, decorated with gold-leaf.

navapuṣkaragarbhakomalābhyāṃ tapanīyojjvalasaṃgatāṃgadābhyām | svapiti sma tathā purā bhujābhyāṃ parirabhya priyavanmṛdaṃgameva ||	Another was sleeping,  embracing her drum as a lover, with her two arms tender like the shoot of young lotus and bearing their bracelets closely linked, blazing with gold.
navahāṭakabhūṣaṇāstathānyā vasanaṃ pītamanuttamaṃ vasānāḥ | avaśā vata nidrayā nipeturgajabhagnā iva karṇikāraśākhāḥ ||	Others, decked with new golden ornaments and wearing peerless yellow garments, fell down alas! helpless with sleep, like the boughs of the Karṇikāra broken by an elephant.
avalaṃbya gavākṣapārśvamanyā śayitā cāpavibhugnagātrayaṣṭiḥ | virarāja vilaṃbicāruhārā racitā toraṇaśālabhaṃjikeva ||	Another, leaning on the side of a window, with her willow-form bent like a bow, shone as she lay with her beautiful necklace hanging down, like a statue  in an archway made by art.
maṇikuṃḍaladaṣṭapatralekhaṃ mukhapadmaṃ vinataṃ tathāparasyāḥ | śatapatramivārdhacakranāḍaṃ sthitakāraṃḍavaghaṭṭitaṃ cakāśe ||	The lotus-face of another, bowed down, with the pinguent-lines on her person rubbed by the jewelled earrings, appeared to be a lotus with its stalk bent into a half-circle, and shaken by a duck standing on it.
aparāḥ śayitā yathopaviṣṭāḥ stanabhārairavamanyamānagātrāḥ | upaguhya parasparaṃ virejurbhujapāśaistapanīyapārihāryaiḥ ||	Others, lying as they sat, with their limbs oppressed by the weight of their bosoms, shone in their beauty, mutually clasping one another with their twining arms decorated with golden bracelets.
mahatīṃ parivādinīṃ ca kācidvanitāliṃgya sakhīmiva prasuptā | vijughūrṇa calatsuvarṇasūtrāṃ vadanenākulakarṇikojjvalena ||	And another damsel lay sound asleep, embracing her big lute as if it were a female friend, and rolled it about, while its golden strings trembled, with her own face bright with her shaken earrings.
paṇavaṃ yuvatirbhujāṃsadeśādavavisraṃsitacārupāśamanyā | savilāsaratāṃtatāṃtamūrvorvivare kāṃtamivābhinīya śiśye ||	Another lay, with her tabour,
aparā na babhurnimīlitākṣyo vipulākṣyo 'pi śubhabhruvo 'pi satyaḥ | pratisaṃkucitāraviṃdakośāḥ savitaryastamite yathā nalinyaḥ ||	Others showed no lustre with their eyes shut, although they were really full-eyed and fair-browed, — like the lotus-beds with their buds closed at the setting of the sun.
śithilākulamūrdhajā tathānyā jaghanasrastavibhūṣaṇāṃśukāṃtā | aśayiṣṭa vikīrṇakaṃṭhasūtrā gajabhagnā pratipātitāṃganeva ||	Another, with her hair loose and dishevelled, and her skirts and ornaments fallen from her loins, lay with her necklace in confusion, like a woman crushed by an elephant and then dropped.
aparāstvavaśā hriyā viyuktā dhṛtimatyo 'pi vapurguṇairupetāḥ | viniśaśvasurulvaṇaṃ śayānā vikṛtākṣiptabhujā jajṛṃbhire ca ||	Others, helpless and lost to shame, though naturally self-possessed and endued with all graces of person, breathed violently as they lay and yawned with their arms distorted and tossed about.
vyapaviddhavibhūṣaṇasrajo 'nyā visṛtāgraṃthanavāsaso visaṃjñāḥ | animīlitaśuklaniścalākṣyo na virejuḥ śayitā gatāsukalpāḥ ||	Others, with their ornaments and garlands thrown off, — unconscious, with their garments spread out unfastened, — their bright eyes wide open and motionless, — lay without any beauty as if they were dead.
vivṛtāsyapuṭā vivṛddhagātrā prapatadvaktrajalā prakāśaguhyā | aparā madaghūrṇiteva śiśye na babhāṣe vikṛtaṃ vapuḥ pupoṣa ||	Another, with fully-developed limbs, her mouth wide open, her saliva dropping, and her person exposed, lay as though sprawling in intoxication, — she spoke not, but bore every limb distorted.

atha so 'vatatāra harmyapṛṣṭhādyuvatīstāḥ śayitā vigarhamāṇaḥ | avatīrya tataśca nirviśaṃko gṛhakakṣyāṃ prathamaṃ vinirjagāma ||	Then he went down from the roof of the palace, scorning those women who lay thus distorted; and having descended, undauntedly he went out first into the courtyard.
turagāvacaraṃ sa bodhayitvā javinaṃ chaṃdakamitthamityuvāca | hayamānaya kaṃthakaṃ tvarāvān amṛtaṃ prāptumito 'dya me yiyāsā ||	Having awakened his horse’s attendant, the swift Chaṃdaka, he thus addressed him: ‘Bring me quickly my horse Kaṃthaka,  I wish to-day to go hence to attain immortality.
hṛdi yā mama tuṣṭiradya jātā vyavasāyaśca yathā dhṛtau niviṣṭaḥ | vijane 'pi ca nāthavānivāsmi dhruvamartho 'bhimukhaḥ sa me ya iṣṭaḥ ||	‘Since such is the firm content which to-day is produced in my heart, and since my determination is settled in calm resolve, and since even in loneliness I seem to possess a guide, — verily the end which I desire is now before me.
hriyameva ca saṃnatiṃ ca hitvā śayitā matpramukhe yathā yuvatyaḥ | vivṛte ca yathā svayaṃ kapāṭe niyataṃ yātumanāmayāya kālaḥ ||	‘Since abandoning all shame and modesty these women lay before me as they did, and the two doors opened of their own accord, verily the time is come to depart for my true health.’
pratigṛhya tataḥ sa bharturājñāṃ viditārtho 'pi nareṃdraśāsanasya | manasīva pareṇa codyamānasturagasyānayane matiṃ cakāra ||	Then, accepting his lord’s command, though he knew the purport of the king’s injunctions, as being urged by a higher power in his mind, he set himself to bring the horse.
atha hemakhalīnapūrṇavaktraṃ laghuśayyāstaraṇopagūḍhapṛṣṭham | balasattvajavatvaropapannaṃ sa varāśvaṃ tamupānināya bhartre ||	Then he brought out for his master that noble steed, his mouth furnished with a golden bit, his back lightly touched by the bed on which he had been lying, and endued with strength, vigour, speed, and swiftness;
pratatatrikapucchamūlapārṣṇiṃ nibhṛtaṃ hrasvatanūjapṛṣṭhakarṇam | vinatonnatapṛṣṭhakukṣipārśvaṃ vipulaprothalalāṭakaṭhyuraskam ||	With a long chine, and root of the tail and heel, — gentle, with short hair, back, and ears, — with his back, belly, and sides depressed and elevated, with broad nostrils, forehead, hips, and breast.
upaguhya sa taṃ viśālavakṣāḥ kamalābhena ca sāṃtvayan kareṇa | madhurākṣarayā girā śaśāsa dhvajinīmadhyamiva praveṣṭukāmaḥ ||	The broad-chested hero, having embraced him, and caressing him with his lotus-like hand, ordered him with a gentle-toned voice, as if he were desirous to plunge into the middle of an army:
bahuśaḥ kaliśatravo nirastāḥ samare tvāmadhiruhya pārthivena | ahamapyamṛtaṃ paraṃ yathāvatturagaśreṣṭha labheya tatkuruṣva ||	‘Oftentimes have evil enemies been overthrown by the king when mounted on thee; do thou, O best of steeds, so exert thyself that I too may obtain the highest immortality.
sulabhāḥ khalu saṃyuge sahāyā viṣayāvāptasukhe dhanārjane vā | puruṣasya tu durlabhāḥ sahāyāḥ patitasyāpadi dharmasaṃśraye vā ||	‘Companions are easy to be found in battle or in the happiness obtained by winning worldly objects or in attaining wealth; but companions are hard for a man to find who has fallen into misfortune or when he flies for refuge to Dharma.
iha caiva bhavaṃti ye sahāyāḥ kaluṣe dharmaṇi dharmasaṃśraye vā | avagacchati me yathāṃtarātmā niyataṃ te 'pi janāstadaṃśabhājaḥ ||	‘And yet all those who in this world are companions, whether in sinful custom or in seeking for Dharma, — as my inner soul now recognises, — they too are verily sharers in the common aim.
tadidaṃ parigamya dharmayuktaṃ mama niryāṇamato jagaddhitāya | turagottama vegavikramābhyāṃ prayatasvātmahite jagaddhite ca ||	‘Since then, when I attain this righteous end, my escape from hence will be for the good of the world, — O best of steeds, by thy speed and energy, strive for thine own good and the good of the world.’
iti suhṛdamivānuśiṣya kṛtye turagavaraṃ nṛvaro vanaṃ yiyāsuḥ | sitamasitagatidyutirvapuṣmān raviriva śāradamabhramāruroha ||	Thus having exhorted the best of steeds like a friend to his duty, he, the best of men, longing to go to the forest, wearing a noble form, in brightness like fire,  mounted the white horse as the sun an autumnal cloud.
atha sa pariharanniśīthacaṃḍaṃ parijanabodhakaraṃ dhvaniṃ sadaśvaḥ | vigatahanuravaḥ praśāṃtaheṣaścakitavimuktapadakramā jagāma ||	Then that good steed, avoiding all noises which would sound startling in the dead of night and awaken the household, — all sound of his jaws hushed and his neighing silenced, — went forth, planting his hurrying steps at full speed.
kanakavalayabhūṣitaprakoṣṭhaiḥ kamalanibhaiḥ kamalāni ca pravidhya | avanatatanavastato 'sya yakṣāścakitagaterdadhire khurān karāgraiḥ ||	With their lotus-like hands, whose fore-arms were adorned with golden bracelets, the Yakṣas, with their bodies bent down, threw lotuses and bore up his hoofs as he rushed in startled haste.
guruparighakapāṭasaṃvṛtā yā na sukhamapi dviradairapāvriyaṃte | vrajati nṛpasute gatasvanāstāḥ svayamabhavan vivṛtāḥ puraḥ pratolyaḥ ||	The city-roads which were closed with heavy gates and bars, and which could be with difficulty opened  even by elephants, flew open of their own accord without noise, as the prince went through.
pitaramabhimukhaṃ sutaṃ ca bālaṃ janamanuraktamanuttamāṃ ca lakṣmīm | kṛtamatirapahāya nirvyapekṣaḥ pitṛnagarāt sa tato vinirjagāma ||	Firm in his resolve and leaving behind without hesitation his father who turned ever towards him,  and his young son, his affectionate people and his unparalleled magnificence, he then went forth out of his father’s city.
atha sa vikacapaṃkajāyatākṣaḥ puramavalokya nanāda siṃhanādam | jananamaraṇayoradṛṣṭapāro na punarahaṃ kapilāhvayaṃ praviṣṭā ||	Then he with his eyes long and like a full-blown lotus, looking back on the city, uttered a sound like a lion, ‘Till I have seen the further shore of birth and death I will never again enter the city called after Kapila.’
iti vacanamidaṃ niśamya tasya draviṇapateḥ pariṣadgaṇā nanaṃduḥ |  pramuditamanasaśca devasaṃghā vyavasitapāraṇamāśaśaṃsire 'smai ||	Having heard this his utterance, the troops of the court of the Lord of wealth  rejoiced; and the hosts of the gods, triumphing, wished him a successful accomplishment of his purpose.
hutavahavapuṣo divaukaso 'nye vyavasitamasya duṣkaraṃ viditvā | akuruta tuhine pathi prakāśaṃ ghanavivarapraṣṛtā iveṃdupādāḥ ||	Other heavenly beings with forms bright like fire, knowing that his purpose was hard to fulfil, produced a light on his dewy path like the rays of the moon issuing from the rift of a cloud.
harituragaturaṃgavatturaṃgaḥ sa tu vicaran manasīva codyamānaḥ | aruṇaparuṣabhāramaṃtarīkṣaṃ sarasabahūni jagāma yojanāni ||	But he with his horse like the horse of Indra, the lord of bay horses, hurrying on as if spurred in his mind, went over the leagues full of many conflicting emotions,  — the sky all the while with its cloud-masses checkered with the light of the dawn.
tatasturaṃgāvacaraḥ sa durmanāstathā vanaṃ bhartari nirmame gate | cakāra yatnaṃ pathi śokavigrahe tathāpi caivāśru na tasya cikṣipe ||	Meanwhile the attendant of the horse, in deep distress, when his unselfish master thus went into the forest, made every effort in the road to dissolve  his load of sorrow, and yet in spite of it all not a tear dropped from him.
yamekarātreṇa tu bharturājñayā jagāma mārgaṃ saha tena vājinā | iyāya bharturvirahaṃ viciṃtayaṃstameva paṃthānamahobhiraṣṭabhiḥ ||	But the road which by his lord’s command he had traversed in one night with that horse, — that same road he now travelled in eight days, pondering his lord’s absence.
hayaśca saujasvi cacāra kaṃthakastatāma bhāvena babhūva nirmadaḥ | alaṃkṛtaścāpi tathaiva bhūṣaṇairabhūdgataśrīriva tena varjitaḥ ||	And the horse Kaṃthaka, though he still went on bravely, flagged and had lost all spirit in his heart; and decked though he was with ornaments, he had lost all his beauty when bereft of his master.
nivṛtya caivābhimukhastapovanaṃ bhṛśaṃ jiheṣe karuṇaṃ muhurmuhuḥ | kṣudhānvito 'pyadhvani śaṣpamaṃbu vā yathā purā nābhinanaṃda nādade ||	And turning round towards that ascetic-grove, he neighed repeatedly with a mournful sound; and though pressed with hunger, he welcomed not nor tasted any grass or water on the road, as before.
tato vihīnaṃ kapilāhvayaṃ puraṃ mahātmanā tena jagaddhitātmanā | krameṇa tau śūnyamivopajagmaturdivākareṇeva vinākṛtaṃ nabhaḥ ||	Slowly they two at last came back to the city called after Kapila, which seemed empty when deserted by that hero who was bent on the salvation of the world, — like the sky bereft of the sun.
sapuṃḍarīkairapi śobhitaṃ jalairalaṃkṛtaṃ puṣpadharairnagairapi | tadeva tasyopavanaṃ vanopamaṃ gatapraharṣairna rarāja nāgaraiḥ ||	Bright as it was with lotus-covered waters, adorned also with trees full of flowers, that garden of his, which was now like a forest, was no longer gay with citizens who had lost all their gladness.
tato bhramadbhirdiśi dīnamānasairanujjvalairvāṣpahatekṣaṇairnaraiḥ | nivāryamāṇāviva tāvubhau puraṃ śanairajaḥsnātamivābhijagmatuḥ ||	Then those two, — who were as it were silently forbidden by the sad inhabitants who were wandering in that direction, their brightness gone and their eyes dim with tears, — slowly entered the city which seemed all bathed in gloom.
niśamya ca srastaśarīragāminau vināgatau śākyakularṣabheṇa tau | mumoca vāṣpaṃ pathi nāgaro janaḥ purā rathe dāśaratherivāgate ||	Having heard that they had returned with their limbs all relaxed, coming back without the pride of the Śākya race, the men of the city shed tears in the road, as when in old days the chariot of the son of Daśaratha came back.
atha bruvaṃtaḥ samupetamanyavo janāḥ pathi cchaṃdakamāgatāśravaḥ | kva rājaputraḥ kularāṣṭravardhano hṛtastvayāsāviti pṛṣṭhato 'nvayuḥ ||	Full of wrath, the people followed Chaṃdaka in the road, crying behind him with tears, ‘Where is the king’s son, the glory of his race and kingdom? he has been stolen away by thee.’
tataḥ sa tān bhaktimato 'bravījjanānnareṃdraputraṃ na parityajāmyaham | rudannahaṃ tena tu nirjane vane gṛhasthaveśaśca visarjitāviti ||	Then he said to those faithful ones, I have not left the king’s son; but by him in the uninhabited forest I weeping and the dress of a householder were abandoned together.’
idaṃ vacastasya niśamya te janāḥ suduṣkaraṃ khalviti niścayaṃ yayuḥ | patadvijahruḥ salilaṃ na netrajaṃ mano niniṃduśca phalārthamātmanaḥ ||	Having heard these words of his those crowds adopted a most difficult resolve; they did not wipe away the tears which fell from their eyes, and they blamed their own (evil) hearts on account of the consequences of their actions;
athocuradyaiva viśāma tadvanaṃ gataḥ sa yatra dviparājavikramaḥ | jijīviṣā nāsti hi tena no vinā yatheṃdriyāṇāṃ vigame śarīriṇām ||	Then they said, ‘Let us go this very day into that forest, whither he is gone, whose gait is like the king of elephants; without him we have no wish to live, like the senses when the souls depart.
idaṃ puraṃ tena vivarjitaṃ vanaṃ vanaṃ ca tattena samanvitaṃ puram | na śobhate tena hi no vinā puraṃ marutvatā vṛtravadhe yathā divam ||	‘This city bereft of him is a forest, and that forest which possesses him is a city; the city without him has no charms for us, like heaven without the lord of the Maruts, when Vṛtra was slain.’
punaḥ kumāro vinivṛtta ityathau gavākṣamālāḥ pratipedire 'ṃganāḥ | viviktapṛṣṭhaṃ ca niśamya vājinaṃ punargavākṣāṇi pidhāya cukruśuḥ ||	Next the women crowded to the rows of windows, crying to one another, ‘The prince has returned;’ but having heard that his horse had an empty back, they closed the windows again and wailed aloud.
praviṣṭadīkṣastu sutopalabdhaye vratena śokena ca khinnamānasaḥ | jajāpa devāyatane narādhipaścakāra tāstāśca yathāśrayāḥ kriyāḥ ||	But the king, having undertaken religious observances for the recovery of his son, with his mind distressed by the vow and the sorrow, was muttering prayers in the temple, and performing such rites as suited the occasion.
tataḥ sa vāṣpapratipūrṇalocanasturaṃgamādāya turaṃgamānasaḥ | viveśa śokābhihato nṛpālayaṃ kṣayaṃ vinīte ripuṇeva bhartari ||	Then with his eyes filled with tears, — taking the horse, his whole soul fixed on the horse, — overcome with grief he  entered the palace as if his master had been killed by an enemy.
vigāhamānaśca nareṃdramaṃdiraṃ vilokayannaśruvahena cakṣuṣā | svareṇa puṣṭena rurāva kaṃthako janāya duḥkhaṃ prativedayanniva ||	And entering the royal stable, looking about with his eyes full of tears, Kaṃthaka uttered a loud sound, as if he were uttering his woe to the people.
tataḥ khagāśca kṣayamadhyagocarāḥ samīpabaddhāsturagāśca satkṛtāḥ | hayasya tasya pratisasvanuḥ svanaṃ nareṃdrasūnorupayānaśaṃkitāḥ ||	Then the birds that fed in the middle of the house, and the carefully cherished horses that were tied near by, re-echoed the sound of that horse, thinking that it might be the return of the prince.
janāśca harṣātiśayena vaṃcitā janādhipāṃtaḥpurasaṃnikarṣagāḥ | yathā hayaḥ kaṃthaka eṣa heṣate dhruvaṃ kumāro viśatīti menire ||	And the people, deceived by an excessive joy, who were in the neighbourhood of the king’s inner apartments, thought in their hearts, ‘Since the horse Kaṃthaka neighs, it must be that the prince is coming.’
atipraharṣādatha śokamūrchitāḥ kumārasaṃdarśanalolalocanāḥ | gṛhādviniścakramurāśayā striyaḥ śaratpayodādiva vidyutaścalāḥ ||	Then the women, who were fainting with sorrow, now in wild joy, with their eyes rolling to see the prince, rushed out of the palace full of hope, like flickering lightnings from an autumn cloud.
vilaṃbaveśyo malināṃśukāṃbarā niraṃjanairvāṣpahatekṣaṇairmukhaiḥ | kṛṣṇā vivarṇāṃjanayā vinākṛtā divīva tārā rajanīkṣayāruṇāḥ ||	With their dress hanging down, and their linen garments soiled, their faces untouched by collyrium and with eyes dimmed by tears; dark and discoloured and destitute of all painting,  like the stars in the sky, pale-red with the ending of night;
araktatāmraiścaraṇairanūpurairakuṃḍalairārjavakarṇikairmukhaiḥ | svabhāvapīnairjaghanairamekhalairahārayoktrairmuṣitairiva stanaiḥ ||	With their feet unstained by red, and undecked by anklets, — their faces without earrings, and their ears in their native simplicity, — their loins with only nature’s fulness, and uncircled by any girdle, — and their bosoms bare of strings of pearls as if they had been robbed.
nirīkṣitā vāṣpaparītalocanaṃ nirāśrayaṃ chaṃdakamaśvameva ca | vivarṇavaktrā rurudurvarāṃganā vanāṃtare gāva ivarṣabhojjhitāḥ ||	But when they saw Chaṃdaka standing helpless, his eyes filled with tears, and the horse, the noble women wept with pale faces, like cows abandoned by the bull in the midst of the forest.
tataḥ savāṣpā mahiṣī mahīpateḥ pranaṣṭavatsā mahiṣīva vatsalā | pragṛhya bāhū nipapāta gautamī vilolaparṇā kadalīva kāṃcanī ||	Then the king’s principal queen Gautamī, like a fond cow that has lost her calf, fell bursting into tears on the ground with outstretched arms, like a golden plantain-tree with trembling leaves.
hatatviṣo 'nyāḥ śithilātmabāhavaḥ striyo viṣādena vicetanā iva | na cukruśurnāśru jahurna śaśvasurna cetanā ullikhitā iva sthitāḥ ||	Some of the other women, bereft of their brightness and with arms and souls lifeless, and seeming to have lost their senses in their despondency, raised no cry, shed no tear, and breathed not, standing senseless as if painted.
adhīramanyāḥ patiśokamūrchitā vilocanaprasravaṇairmukhaiḥ striyaḥ | siṣiṃcire proṣitacaṃdanān stanān dharādharaḥ prasravaṇairivopalān ||	Others as having lost all self-control, fainting in their sorrow for their lord, their faces pouring tears from their eyes, watered their bosoms from which all sandal-wood was banished, like a mountain the rocks with its streams.
mukhaiśca tāsāṃ nayanāṃbutāḍitaiḥ rarāja tadrājaniveśanaṃ tadā | navāṃbukāle 'ṃbudavṛṣṭitāḍitaiḥ sravajjalaistāmarasairyathā saraḥ ||	Then that royal palace was illumined with their faces pelted by the tears from their eyes, as a lake in the time of the first rains with its dripping lotuses pelted by the rain from the clouds.
suvṛttapīnāṃgulibhirniraṃtarairabhūṣaṇairgūḍhaśirairvarāṃganāḥ | urāṃsi jaghnuḥ kamalopamaiḥ karaiḥ svapallavairvātacalā latā iva ||	The noble women beat their breasts with their lotus-like hands, falling incessantly, whose fingers were round and plump, which had their arteries hidden and bore no ornaments, — as creepers tossed by the wind strike themselves with their shoots.
karaprahārapracalaiśca tā babhuryathāpi nāryaḥ sahitonnataiḥ stanaiḥ | vanānilāghūrṇitapadmakaṃpitaiḥ rathāṃganāmnāṃ mithunairivāpagāḥ ||	And again how those women shine forth, as their bosoms rose up together after the blow from the hand, and trembled with the shock, like the streams, when their pairs of ruddy geese shake, as the lotuses on which they sit wave about with the wind from the wood.
yathā ca vakṣāṃsi karairapīḍayaṃstathaiva vakṣobhirapīḍayan karān | akārayaṃstatra parasparaṃ vyathāḥ karāgravakṣāṃsyabalā dayālasāḥ ||	As they pressed their breasts with their hands, so too they pressed their hands with their breasts, — dull to all feelings of pity, they made their hands and bosoms inflict mutual pains on each other.
tatastu roṣapraviraktalocanā viṣādasaṃbaṃdhakaṣāyagadgadam | uvāca niḥśvāsacalatpayodharā vigādhaśokāśrudharā yaśodharā ||	Then thus spoke Yaśodharā, shedding tears with deep  sorrow, her bosom heaving with her sighs, her eyes discoloured with aneer, and her voice choking with emotion through the influence of despondency:
niśi prasuptāmavaśāṃ vihāya māṃ gataḥ kva sa cchaṃdaka manmanorathaḥ | upāgate ca tvayi kaṃthake ca me samaṃ gateṣu triṣu kaṃpate manaḥ ||	‘Leaving me helplessly asleep in the night, whither, O Chaṃdaka, is he, the desire of my heart, gone? and when thou and Kaṃthaka are alone come back, while three went away together, my mind trembles.
anāryamasnidghamamitrakarma me nṛśaṃsa kṛtvā kimihādya rodiṣi | niyaccha vāṣpaṃ bhava tuṣṭamānaso na saṃvadatyaśru ca tacca karma te ||	‘Why dost thou weep to-day, O cruel one, having done a dishonourable, pitiless, and unfriendly deed to me? Cease thy tears and be content in thy heart, — tears and that deed of thine ill agree.
priyeṇa vaśyena hitena sādhunā tvayā sahāyena yathārthakāriṇā | gato 'ryaputro hyapunarnivṛttaye ramasva diṣṭyā saphalaḥ śramastava ||	‘Through thee, his dear obedient faithful loyal companion, always doing what was right, the son of my lord is gone never to return, — rejoice, — all hail! thy pains have gained their end.
varaṃ manuṣyasya vicakṣaṇo ripurna mitramaprājñamayogapeśalam | suhṛdbruveṇa hyavipaścitā tvayā kṛtaḥ kulasyāsya mahānupaplavaḥ ||	‘Better for a man a wise enemy rather than a foolish friend unskilled in emergencies; by thee, the unwise self-styled friend, a great calamity has been brought upon this family.
imā hi śocyā vyavamuktabhūṣaṇāḥ prasaktavāṣpāvilaraktalocanāḥ | sthite 'pi patyau himavanmahīsame pranaṣṭaśobhā vidhavā iva striyaḥ ||	‘These women are sorely to be pitied who have put away their ornaments, having their eyes red and dimmed with continuous tears, who are as it were desolate widows, though their lord still stands as unshaken as the earth or Mount Himavat.
imāśca vikṣiptaviṭaṃkabāhavaḥ prasaktapārāvatadīrghanisvanāḥ | vinākṛtāstena sahaiva rodhanairbhṛśaṃ rudaṃtīva vimānapaṃktayaḥ ||	‘And these lines of palaces seem to weep aloud, flinging up their dovecots for arms, with the long unbroken moan of their doves, — separated verily, with him, from all who could restrain them.
anarthakāmo 'sya janasya sarvathā turaṃgamo 'pi dhruvameṣa kaṃthakaḥ | jahāra sarvasvamitastathā hi me jane prasupte niśi ratnacauravat ||	‘Even that horse Kaṃthaka without doubt desired my utter ruin; for he bore away from hence my treasure when all were sound asleep in the night, — like one who steals jewels.
yadā samarthaḥ khalu soḍhumāgatāniṣuprahārānapi kiṃ punaḥ kaśāḥ | gataḥ kaśāpātabhayāt kathaṃ tvayaṃ śriyaṃ gṛhītvā hṛdayaṃ ca me samam ||	‘When he was able to bear even the onsets of arrows, and still more the strokes of whips, — how then for fear of the fall of a whip, could he go carrying with him my prosperity and my heart together?
anāryakarmā bhṛśamadya heṣate nareṃdradhiṣṇyaṃ pratipūrayanniva | yadā tu nirvāhayati sma me priyaṃ tadā hi mūkasturagādhamo 'bhavat ||	‘The base creature now neighs loudly, filling the king’s palace with the sound; but when he carried away my beloved, then this vilest of horses was dumb.
yadi hyaheṣiṣyata bodhayañjanaṃ khuraiḥ kṣitau vāpyakariṣyata dhvanim | hanusvanaṃ vājanayiṣyaduttamaṃ na cābhaviṣyanmama duḥkhamīdṛśam ||	‘If he had neighed and so woke up the people, or had even made a noise with his hoofs on the ground, or had made the loudest sound he could with his jaws, my grief would not have been so great.’
itīha devyāḥ paridevitāśrayaṃ niśamya vāṣpagrathitākṣaraṃ vacaḥ | adhomukhaḥ sāśrukalaḥ kṛtāṃjaliḥ śanairidaṃ chaṃdaka uttaraṃ jagau ||	Having thus heard the queen’s words, their syllables choked with tears and full of lament, slowly Chaṃdaka uttered this answer, with his face bent down, his voice low with tears, and his hands clasped in supplication:
vigarhituṃ nārhasi devi kaṃthakaṃ na cāpi roṣaṃ mayi kartumarhasi | anāgasau svaḥ samavehi sarvaśo gato nṛdevaḥ sa hi devi devavat ||	‘Surely, O queen, thou wilt not blame Kaṃthaka nor wilt thou show thy anger against me, know that we two are entirely guiltless, — that god amongst men, O queen, is gone away like a god.
ahaṃ hi jānannapi rājaśāsanaṃ balātkṛtaḥ kairapi daivatairiva | upānayaṃ tūrṇamimaṃ turaṃgamaṃ tathānvagacchaṃ vigataśramo 'dhvani ||	‘I indeed, though I well knew the king’s command, as though dragged by force by some divine powers, brought quickly to him this swift steed, and followed him on the road unwearied.
vrajannayaṃ vājivaro 'pi nāspṛśanmahīṃ khurāgrairvidhṛtairivāṃtarā | tathaiva daivādiva saṃyatānano hanusvanaṃ nākṛta nāpyaheṣata ||	‘And this best of horses as he went along touched not the ground with the tips of his hoofs as if they were kept aloft from it; and so too, having his mouth restrained as by fate, he made no sound with his jaws and neighed not.
yadā vahirgacchati pārthivātmajastadābhavaddvāramapāvṛtaṃ svayam | tamaśca naiśaṃ raviṇeva pāṭitaṃ tato 'pi daivo vidhireṣa gṛhyatām ||	‘When the prince went out, then the gate was thrown open of its own accord; and the darkness of the night was, as it were, pierced by the sun, — we may learn from hence too that this was the ordering of fate.
yadāpramatto 'pi nareṃdraśāsanādgṛhe pure caiva sahasraśo janaḥ | tadā sa nābudhyata nidrayā hṛtastato 'pi daivo vidhireṣa gṛhyatām ||	‘When also by the king’s command, in palace and city, diligent guards had been placed by thousands, and at that time they were all overcome by sleep and woke not, — we may learn from hence too that this was the ordering of fate.
yataśca vāso vanavāsasaṃmataṃ visṛṣṭamasmai samaye divaukasā | divi praviddhaṃ mukuṭaṃ ca taddhṛtaṃ tato 'pi daivo vidhireṣa gṛhyatām ||	‘When also the garment, approved for a hermit’s dwelling in the forest, was offered to him at the moment by some denizen of heaven, and the tiara which he threw into the sky was carried off, — we may learn from hence too that this was the ordering of fate.
tadevamāvāṃ naradevi doṣato na tatprayātaṃ pratigaṃtumarhasi | na kāmakāro mama nāsya vājinaḥ kṛtānuyātraḥ sa hi daivatairgataḥ ||	‘Do not therefore assume  that his departure arises from the fault of either of us, O queen; neither I nor this horse acted by our own choice; he went on his way with the gods as his retinue.’
iti prayāṇaṃ bahudhaivamadbhutaṃ niśamya tāstasya mahātmanaḥ striyaḥ | pranaṣṭaśokā iva vismayaṃ yayurmanojvaraṃ pravrajanāttu lebhire ||	Having thus heard the history of the prince’s departure, so marvellous in many ways, those women, as though losing their grief, were filled with wonder, but they again took up their distress at the thought of his becoming an ascetic.
viṣādapāriplavalocanā tataḥ pranaṣṭapotā kurarīva duḥkhitā | vihāya dhairyaṃ virurāva gautamī tatāma caivāśrumukhī jagāda ca ||	With her eyes filled with the tears of despondency, wretched like an osprey who has lost her young, — Gautamī abandoning all self-control wailed aloud, — she fainted, and with a weeping face exclaimed:
mahormimaṃto mṛdavo 'sitāḥ śubhāḥ pṛthakpṛthagmūlaruhāḥ samudgatāḥ | praceritāste bhuvi tasya mūrdhajā nareṃdramaulīpariveṣṭanakṣamāḥ ||	‘Beautiful, soft, black, and all in great waves, growing each from its own special root, — those hairs of his are tossed on the ground, worthy to be encircled by a royal diadem.
pralaṃbabāhurmṛgarājavikramo mahārṣabhākṣaḥ kanakojjvaladyutiḥ | viśālavakṣā ghanaduṃdubhisvanastathāvidho 'pyāśramavāsamarhati ||	‘With his long arms and lion-gait, his bull-like eye, and his beauty bright like gold, his broad chest, and his voice deep as a drum or a cloud, should such a hero as this dwell in a hermitage?
abhāginī nūnamiyaṃ vasuṃdharā tamāryakarmāṇamanuttamaṃ prati | gatastato 'sau guṇavān hi tādṛśo nṛpaḥ prajābhāgyaguṇaiḥ prasūyate ||	‘This earth is indeed unworthy as regards that peerless doer of noble actions, for such a virtuous hero has gone away from her, — it is the merits and virtues of the subjects which produce their king.
sujātajālāvatatāṃgulī mṛdū nigūḍhagulphau viṣapuṣpakomalau | vanāṃtabhūmiṃ kaṭhināṃ kathaṃ nu tau sacakramadhyau caraṇau gamiṣyataḥ ||	‘Those two feet of his, tender, with their beautiful web spread between the toes, with their ankles concealed, and soft like a blue lotus, — how can they, bearing a wheel marked in the middle, walk on the hard ground of the skirts of the forest?
vimānapṛṣṭhe śayanāsanocitaṃ mahārhavastrāgurucaṃdanārcitam | kathaṃ nu śītoṣṇajalāgameṣu taccharīramojasvi vane bhaviṣyati ||	‘That body, which deserves to sit or lie on the roof of a palace, — honoured with costly garments, aloes, and sandal-wood, — how will that manly body live in the woods, exposed to the attacks of the cold, the heat, and the rain?
kulena sattvena balena varcasā śrutena lakṣmyā vayasā ca garvitaḥ | pradātumevābhyudito na yācituṃ kathaṃ sa bhikṣāṃ parataścariṣyati ||	‘He who was proud of his family, goodness, strength, energy, sacred learning, beauty, and youth, — who was ever ready to give, not to ask, — how will he go about begging alms from others?
śucau śayitvā śayane hiraṇmaye prabodhyamāno niśi tūryanisvanaiḥ | kathaṃ vata svapsyati so 'dya me vratī paṭaukadeśāṃtarite mahītale ||	‘He who, lying on a spotless golden bed, was awakened during the night by the concert of musical instruments, — how alas! will he, my ascetic, sleep to-day on the bare ground with only one rag of cloth interposed?’
imaṃ vilāpaṃ karuṇaṃ niśamya tā bhujaiḥ pariṣvajya parasparaṃ striyaḥ | vilocanebhyaḥ salilāni tatyajurmadhūni puṣpebhya iveritā latāḥ ||	Having heard this piteous lamentation, the women, embracing one another with their arms, rained the tears from their eyes, as the shaken creepers drop honey from their flowers.
tato dharāyāmapatadyaśodharā vicakravākeva rathāṃgasāhvayā | śanaiśca tattadvilalāpa viklavā muhurmuhurgadgadaruddhayā girā ||	Then Yaśodharā fell upon the ground, like the ruddy goose parted from her mate, and in utter bewilderment she slowly lamented, with her voice repeatedly stopped by sobs:
sa māmanāthāṃ sahadharmacāriṇīmapāsya dharmaṃ yadi kartumicchati | kuto 'sya dharmaḥ sahadharmacāriṇīṃ vinā tapo yaḥ paribhoktumicchati ||	‘If he wishes to practise a religious life after abandoning me his lawful wife widowed, — where is his religion, who wishes to follow penance without his lawful wife to share it with him?
śṛṇoti nūnaṃ sa na pūrvapārthivān mahāsudarśaprabhṛtīn pitāmahān | vanāni patnīsahitānupeyuṣastathā sa dharmaṃ madṛte cikīrṣati ||	‘He surely has never heard of the monarchs of olden times, his own ancestors, Mahāsudarśa  and the rest, — how they went with their wives into the forest, — that he thus wishes to follow a religious life without me.
makheṣu vā vedavidhānasaṃskṛtau na daṃpatī paśyati dīkṣitāvubhau | samaṃ bubhukṣū parato 'pi tatphalaṃ tato 'sya jāto mayi dharmamatsaraḥ ||	‘He does not see that husband and wife are both consecrated in sacrifices, and both purified by the performance of the rites of the Veda, and both destined to enjoy  the same results afterwards, — he therefore grudges me a share in his merit.
dhruvaṃ sa jānan mama dharmavallabho manaḥ priye 'pyākalahaṃ muhurmithaḥ | sukhaṃ vibhīrmāmapahāya rosaṇāṃ maheṃdraloke 'psaraso jighṛkṣati ||	‘Surely it must be that this fond lover of religion, knowing that my mind was secretly quarrelling even with my beloved, lightly and without fear has deserted me thus angry, in the hope to obtain heavenly nymphs in lndra’s world!
iyaṃ tu ciṃtā mama kīdṛśaṃ nu tā vapurguṇaṃ bibhrati tatra yoṣitaḥ | vane yadarthaṃ sa tapāṃsi tapyate śriyaṃ ca hitvā mama bhaktimeva ca ||	‘But what kind of a thought is this of mine? those women even there have the attributes which belong to bodies, — for whose sake he thus practises austerities in the forest, deserting his royal magnificence and my fond devotion.
na khalviyaṃ svargasukhāya me spṛhā na tajjanasyātmavato 'pi durlabham | sa tu priyo māmiha vā paratra vā kathaṃ na jahyāditi me manorathaḥ ||	‘I have no such longing for the joy of heaven, nor is that hard for even common people to win if they are resolute;  but my one desire is how he my beloved may never leave me either in this world or the next.
abhāginī yadyahamāyatekṣaṇaṃ śucismitaṃ bharturudīkṣituṃ mukham | na maṃdabhāgyo 'rhati rāhulo 'pyayaṃ kadācidaṃke parivartituṃ pituḥ ||	‘Even if I am unworthy to look on my husbands face with its long eyes and bright smile, still is this poor Rāhula never to roll about in his father’s lap?
aho nṛśaṃsaṃ sukumāravarcasaḥ sudāruṇaṃ tasya manasvino manaḥ | kalapralāpaṃ dviṣato 'pi harṣaṇaṃ śiśuṃ sutaṃ yastyajatīdṛśaṃ svataḥ ||	‘Alas! the mind of that wise hero is terribly stern, — gentle as his beauty seems, it is pitilessly cruel, — who can desert of his own accord such an infant son with his inarticulate talk, one who would charm even an enemy.
mamāpi kāmaṃ hṛdayaṃ sudāruṇaṃ śilāmayaṃ vāpyayasāpi vā kṛtam | anāthavacchrīrahite sukhocite vanaṃ gate bhartari yanna dīryate ||	‘My heart too is certainly most stern, yea, made of rock or fashioned even of iron, which does not break when its lord is gone to the forest, deserted by his royal glory like an orphan, — he so well worthy of happiness.’
itīha devī patiśokamūrchitā ruroda dadhyau vilalāpa cāsakṛt | svabhāvadhīrāpi hi sā satī śucā dhṛtiṃ na sasmāra cakāra no hriyam ||	So the queen, fainting in her woe, wept and pondered and wailed aloud repeatedly, — self-possessed as she was by nature, yet in her distress she remembered not her fortitude and felt no shame.
tatastathā śokavilāpaviklavāṃ yaśodharāṃ prekṣya vasuṃdharāgatām | mahāraviṃdairiva vṛṣṭitāḍitairmukhaiḥ savāṣpairvanitā vicukruśuḥ ||	Seeing Yaśodharā thus bewildered with her wild utterances of grief and fallen on the ground, all the women cried out with their faces streaming with tears like large lotuses beaten by the rain.
samāptajāpyaḥ kṛtahomamaṃgalo nṛpastu devāyatanādviniryayau | janasya tenārttaraveṇa cāhataścacāla vajradhvanineva vāraṇaḥ ||	But the king, having ended his prayers, and performed the auspicious rites of the sacrifice, now came out of the temple; and being smitten by the wailing sound of the people, he tottered like an elephant at the crash of a thunderbolt.
niśāmya ca cchaṃdakakaṃthakāvubhau sutasya saṃśrutya ca niścayaṃ sthiram | papāta śokābhihato mahīpatiḥ śacīpatervṛtta ivotsave dhvajaḥ ||	Having heard (of the arrival) of both Chaṃdaka and Kaṃthaka, and having learned the fixed resolve of his son, the lord of the earth fell struck down by sorrow like the banner of Indra when the festival is over.
tato muhūrtaṃ sutaśokamohito janena tulyābhijanena dhāritaḥ | nirīkṣya dṛṣṭyā jalapūrṇayā hayaṃ mahītalastho vilalāpa pārthivaḥ ||	Then the king, distracted by his grief for his son, being held up for a moment by his attendants all of the same race, gazed on the horse with his eyes filled with tears, and then falling on the ground wailed aloud:
bahūni kṛtvā samare priyāṇi me mahattvayā kaṃthaka vipriyaṃ kṛtam | guṇapriyo yena vane sa me priyaḥ priyo 'pi sannapriyavat praceritaḥ ||	‘After having done many dear exploits for me in battle, one great deed of cruelty, O Kaṃthaka, hast thou done, — for by thee that dear son of mine, dear for his every virtue, has been tossed down in the wood, dear as he was, like a worthless thing.
tadadya māṃ vā naya tatra yatra sa vraja drutaṃ vā punarenamānaya | ṛte hi tasmānmama nāsti jīvitaṃ vigāḍharogasya sadauṣadhādiva ||	‘Therefore either lead me to-day where he is, or go quickly and bring him back again; without him there is no life left to me, as to one plunged in sickness without the true medicine.
suvarṇaniṣṭhīvini mṛtyunā hṛte suduṣkaraṃ yanna mamāra sṛṃjayaḥ | ahaṃ punardharmaratau sute gate 'mumukṣurātmānamanātmavāniva ||	‘When Suvarṇaniṣṭhīvin was carried away by death, it seemed impossible that Sṛṃjaya  should not die; and shall I, when my duty-loving son is gone, fear to set my soul free, like any coward?
vibhordaśakṣatrakṛtaḥ prajāpateḥ parāparajñasya vivasvadātmanaḥ | priyeṇa putreṇa satā vinākṛtaṃ kathaṃ na muhyeddhi mano manorapi ||	‘How should not the mind of Manu himself be distracted, when parted from his dear virtuous son,  — (Manu) the son of Vivasvat, who knew the higher and the lower, the mighty lord of creatures, the institutor of the ten chieftains.
ajasya rājñastanayāya dhīmate narādhipāyeṃdrasakhāya me spṛhā | gate vanaṃ yastanaye divaṃ gato na moghavāṣpaḥ kṛpaṇaṃ jijīva ha ||	‘I envy the monarch, that friend of Indra, the wise son of king Aja,  who, when his son went into the forest, went himself to heaven, and dragged out no miserable life here with vain tears.
pracakṣva me bhadra tadāśramājiraṃ hṛtastvayā yatra sa me jalāṃjaliḥ | ime parīpsaṃti hi te pipāsavo mamāsavaḥ pretagatiṃ yiyāsavaḥ ||	‘Describe to me, O beloved one, the court of that hermitage, whither thou hast carried him who is as my funeral oblation of water; these my vital airs are all ready to depart, and are eager for it, longing to drink it.’
iti tanayaviyogajātaduḥkhaṃ kṣitisadṛśaṃ sahajaṃ vihāya dhairyam | daśaratha iva rāmaśokavaśyo bahu vilalāpa nṛpo visaṃjñakalpaḥ ||	Thus the king, in his grief for his separation from his son, — losing all his innate firmness which was stedfast like the earth, — loudly lamented as one distraught, like Daśaratha, a prey to his sorrow for Rāma.
śrutavinayaguṇānvitastatastaṃ matisacivaḥ pravayāḥ purohitaśca | avadhṛtamidamūcaturyathāvanna ca paritaptamukhau na cāpyaśokau ||	Then the wise counsellor, endued with religious learning, courtesy, and virtue, and the old family priest, spoke to him as was befitting in these well-weighed words, neither with their faces overwhelmed by grief nor yet wholly unmoved:
tyaja naravara śokamehi dhairyaṃ kudhṛtirivārhasi dhīra nāśru moktum | srajamiva mṛditāmapāsya lakṣmīṃ bhuvi bahavo hi nṛpā vanānyatīyuḥ ||	‘Cease, O noblest of men, thy grief, regain thy firmness, — surely thou wilt not, O firm hero, shed tears like one of no self-control; many kings on this earth have gone into the forests, throwing away their royal pomp like a crushed wreath.
api ca niyata eṣa tasya bhāvaḥ smara vacanaṃ tadṛṣeḥ purāsitasya | na hi sa divi na cakravartirājye kṣaṇamapi vāsayituṃ sukhena śakyaḥ ||	‘Moreover, this his state of mind was all predetermined; remember those words long ago of the holy sage Asita; “He will never be made to dwell even for a moment contentedly in heaven or in an emperor’s domain.”
yadi tu nṛvara kārya eva yatnastvaritamudāhara yāvadatra yāvaḥ | bahuvidhamiha yuddhamastu tāvattava tanayasya vidheśca tasya tasya ||	‘But if, O best of men, the effort must be made, quickly speak the word, we two will at once go together; let the battle be waged in every way with thy son and his fate whatever it be.’
narapatiratha tau śaśāsa tasmāddrutamita eva yuvāmabhiprayātam | na hi mama hṛdayaṃ prayāti śāṃtiṃ vanaśakuneriva putralālasasya ||	Then the king commanded them both, ‘Do you both go quickly hence, — my heart will not return to quiet, any more than a bird’s in the woods longing for its young.’
paramamiti nareṃdraśāsanāttau yayaturamātyapurohitau vanaṃ tat | kṛtamiti savadhūjanaḥ sadāro nṛpatirapi pracakāra śeṣakāryam ||	With a prompt acquiescence at the king’s order the counsellor and the family priest went to that forest; and then with his wives and his queen the king also, saying, ‘It is done,’ performed the remainder of the rites.

maitrāyajño, bhītaḥ saṃvignaḥ,	Maitrāyajña, fearful and anxious,
sarveṇa bhāvena mātā-pitroḥ praṇipātaṃ ktvāha:	after prostrating with his whole being to his mother and father, said:
“ūrdhvam bhavāgravitatān adharād avīciṃ,	“Stretching from the top of existence to the Ceaseless hell,
tiryak-prathān agaṇitān api loka-dhātūn,	through countless pathways across the world systems,

nityaṃ ca kila tasya mātā-śiṣam prayuṅkte:	And all the time, it seems, his mother was praying:
“yady asti mama kiṃcit puṇya-phalam pradānena vā,	“If there is some fruit of merit for me, from giving,
śīlena vā brahmacaryeṇa vā pativratatvena vā,	or from virtue, or from the spiritual life, or from the vows (I undertook),
tena puṇya-phalena, mama putrasya, yatra tatra sthitasya, mā kiṃcit pāpam bhavatu!”	through the fruit of that merit, may my son, wherever he may be, not have any misfortune!”
tena ca tasya śivam āsīt |	And through that he was safe.
yathā śyāma-jātake saviṣeṇa śareṇa …	As in the Śyāma story,
śyāma-kumārasya mātā-pitror āśīr-vacanena	Because of the blessing of prince Śyāma’s mother and father
śalyaś ca nirgato, viṣaṃ ca naṣṭam, mtaś ca saṃjīvitas |	the dart came out, the poison was destroyed, and he who was dead returned to life.
tadvat tasyāpi śivam āsīt |	Because of that (blessing) he was safe.
yathā vajra-rājaghe dhanaṃjaya-sūtre ārya-śāradvatīputreṇoktam:	Just as was said by the noble Śāradvatīputra
“tam enam brāhmaṇam mātā-pitarau samam mānitau,	“That brahmin honoured regularly his mother and father,
samyak pūjitau kalyāṇena manasānukampete |	and rightly worshipped them with a beautiful mind set on compassion.
adhosī vatana putro dhārmikeṇa, karma-guṇena,	Shaken, their son (acted) according to righteousness, virtuously,
na ca kiṃcit pāpaṃ karma karoti.”	and never did any wicked deed.”
sarvaṃ sūtraṃ yojyam |	The whole discourse can be utilised (here).
yathā ca śivālaka-sūtre bhagavatoktam:	Just as in the Śivālaka discourse,
“tam evaṃ gha-pati-putra mātā-pitarau pañcasu sthāneṣu pratyupasthitau,	“Householder’s son, as your mother and father served you in five ways,
pañcasu sthāneṣu pratiṣṭhāpayataḥ |	so should you serve them in five ways.
tasya punar gha-pati-putra mātā-pitbhyām anukampitasya puruṣa-pudgalasya vddhir evam pratyāśaṃsitavyā.”	Householder’s son, again, when an individual has compassion for his mother and father prosperity is to be expected.”
sa tatra prīty-āhāraḥ sthitvā, paripūrṇeṣu ṣaṣṭi-varṣa-sahasreṣu kāla-gataḥ |	So he remained, feeding on joy, for a full 60,000 years.
yathā rājājātaśatrur aparipūrṇa eva nairayikāyuḥ-pramāṇe cyutaḥ |	Just as king Ajātaśatru passed away before the (full) measure of life in hell was fulfilled.
abandhyatvāt karmaṇāṃ kadācid atīva śirorujā bhavati |	(But) as deeds are not barren he still had severe headaches.
atra kta-praṇidhānasya maitrāyajñasya mātā-pit-śuśrūṣā vaktavyā |	We should also say here that after Maitrāyajña made his aspiration he was eager to obey his mother and father.
yathā śyāma-jātake ’ndhau mātā-pitarau hasti-bhūtena paripālitau |	Just as in the Śyāma birth story his blind mother and father protected him with their hands.
anyeṣu jātaka-śateṣu ca |	And a hundred other birth stories.
atha bhagavān prāpta-kālam, bhikṣūn āmantrayate |	Then the Fortunate One, when the time had arrived, addressed the monastics:
“syād evam bhikṣavo yuṣmākam anyaḥ sa tena kālena tena samayena	“It may be, monastics, that at that time, on that occasion,
maitrāyajño nāma sārtha-vāha-putro babhūveti |	(you think) it was Maitrāyajña, who became the son of a caravan leader.
naivaṃ draṣṭavyam |	It should not be seen like this.
ahaṃ sa tena kālena tena samayena maitrāyajño nāma sārtha-vāha-putra āsīt |	At that time, on that occasion, I was Maitrāyajña, the son of a caravan leader.
tasmāt tarhi bhikṣavo mama vacanaṃ śraddadhānair |	Therefore, monastics, have faith in my words.
buddhe sagauravair bhavitavyaṃ |	You should have respect for the Buddha.
dharme saṃghe sagauravair bhavitavyam |	You should have respect for the Dharma and the Saṅgha.
mātā-pitṣu ācāryopādhyāyeṣu sagauravair bhavitavyam |	You should have respect for your mother and father, teachers and preceptors.
evaṃ vo bhikṣavaḥ śikṣitavyam |	In this way you should train yourselves, monastics.
ya evaṃ deśāntara-gataḥ sukhaṃ duḥkham pratyanubhavati,	Whoever has gone to another country experiences both happiness and suffering,
yathā maitrāyajñena deśāntara-gatena,	just as Maitrāyajña, when he had gone to another country,
tasminn eva janmani pratyeka-svargam pratyeka-narakaṃ cānubhūtam,	there underwent in his life a personal heaven and a personal hell,
ya evaṃ deśāntara-gataḥ sukhaṃ duḥkham pratyanubhavati.”	(so) whoever has gone to another country experiences both happiness and suffering.”
idaṃ karma deśāntara-vipākam |	This is the deed that has results in another country.
etad darśayati bhagavān:	This was shown by the Fortunate One:
“yathā mayi tathā mātā-pitṣu, ācāryopādhyāyeṣu |	“As with me, so it is with mother and father, teachers and preceptors.
vacana-kāriṇāṃ samo vipākaḥ iha loke paraloke ca |	The word spoken has the same result in this world and in the next world.
katham iha loke samaḥ karma-vipāko bhavati?	How is the result of the deed the same in this world?
yathā śrāvastyāṃ daridra-puruṣo,	Just like the poor man in Śrāvastī,
bhagavantaṃ saśrāvaka-saṃgham bhuñjānaṃ dṣṭvā,	after seeing the Fortunate One together with the Saṅgha of disciples eating,
cittam prasāditavān |	his mind became full of faith.
tena mahā-puṇya-sambhāra upārjitaḥ, rājya-saṃvartanīyaṃ karma ktam |	Through this deed that he did he acquired a great heap of merit, which led him to majesty.
tad eva ca mokṣa-bījam |	It was also the seed of his release (from saṃsāra).
tac ca jñātvā bhagavatā gāthā bhāṣitā:	Knowing this the Fortunate One spoke this verse:
“ye tatrābhyanumodante, vaiyāvtyakarāś ca ye,	“Those who rejoice here, and those who serve,
anūnā dakṣiṇā teṣāṃ, te ’pi puṇyasya bhāginaḥ.”	are not lacking in skill, they are entitled to their merit.”
etad eva gāthā samutthānam:	This is the basis of the verse:
tataś cyutaś ca deveṣūpapannaḥ |	Then he passed away and was reborn amongst the gods.
yathā ca tagara-śikhī nāma pratyeka-buddhaḥ |	Just as with the Independent Buddha called Tagaraśikhī.
durbhikṣe daridra-puruṣeṇa sūpaḥ pratipāditaḥ,	In a time of famine he received a broth from a poor man,
sa ca tad-ahar eva tasmin nagare rājābhiṣiktaḥ |	and on that same day (the poor man) in that very city was anointed king.
tataḥ kālāntareṇa pratyeka-buddhaḥ saṃvttaḥ |	And after an interval of time he became an Independent Buddha.
ya eṣa sūtrantare paripaṭhitaḥ pratyeka-buddhas tagara-śikhī nāma |	He is mentioned in another discourse
evaṃ tāvad bhagavati sāṃdṣṭikaś citta-prasādasya phala-vipākaḥ |	So from that mind full of faith in the Fortunate One he had an immediate fruit and result.
katham mātā-pitṣu?	How is it with mother and father?
yathā maitrāyajñaḥ sārtha-vāha-putraḥ	Just as Maitrāyajña, the son of a caravan leader,
ācaturtham pratinivtto mātur vacanena,	four times was turned back by the word of his mother,
caturṣu mahā-nagareṣu pratyeka-svarga-sukham anubhūtavān,	(so) he experienced the pleasure of a personal heaven in four great cities,
tat tu tasya mokṣa-bījam,	and through that (planted) the seed of release (from saṃsāra),
evam mātā-pitṣv api sāṃdṣṭikaḥ phala-vipākaḥ |	so he also had an immediate fruit and result through (respecting) mother and father.
katham bhagavati mātā-pitṣu ca citta-pradoṣeṇa naraka-gamanam bhavati?	And how does one with corrupt mind towards the Fortunate One, and mother and father, go to hell?
“devadatto, bhagavati cittam pra[doṣa]to, ’vīcau mahā-narake patitaḥ.”	“Devadatta, through having a corrupt thought towards the Fortunate One, fell into the great and Ceaseless hell.”
tathā sindhu-viṣaye raurukaṃ nāma nagaram,	Likewise in the Sindhu realm
tatra śikhaṇḍī rāja-putraḥ, pitaraṃ ghātayitvā, narake patitaḥ |	and there prince Śikhaṇḍī, having killed his father, fell into hell.
evam bhagavati mātā-pitṣu ca citta-pradūṣaṇena naraka-gamanam bhavati |	This is how one with corrupt mind towards the Fortunate One, and mother and father, goes to hell.
tena kāraṇena kiṃ nāsti nānā-karaṇam?	What, is there no differentiation made?
“mahāntaṃ nānā-karaṇam.”	“There is a great differentiation made.”
bhagavān aneka-kalpa-śata-sahasropārjita-kuśala-mūla-sambhūta-sambhāraḥ |	The Fortunate One produced and accumulated the roots of wholesomeness that were acquired over one hundred thousand aeons and an uncountable (amount of time).
anutpannasya mārgasyotpādayitā buddho, bodhāya mārgaṃ deśayati |	When the path was unknown, the Buddha attained it, and pointed out the path to Awakening.
tasmin ktaḥ prasādo ’prameya-phala-vipākaḥ, ante ca nirvāṇam |	Therefore having faith (in him) has fruit and results that are immeasurable, and in the end there is Nirvāṇa.
mātā-pitror mokṣa-mārgo ’viditaḥ |	(But) mother and father to not know the path to release.
api ca na sarvam mātā-pitror vacanaṃ kāryam |	Again mother and father’s word is not made for everyone.
santi kecin mithyā-darśanopahata-cittāḥ putrān bruvanti:	Some (parents’) minds are affected by wrong views and they say to their son:
“ehi mām avasanaṃ naya,	“Come, lead me to the wilderness (to die there),
tava ca bhaviṣyati hitāya sukhāya mama ca |	this will be both for your good and happiness and for mine.
[prapāte mām pā]tayāgnau vā praveśayeti.”	[Throw me down a precipice,] or, make me enter a fire.”
tan naiva kartavyam |	(But) this is not to be done.
kiṃ kāraṇam?	What is the reason?
mātā-pitarau ghātayitvāvaśyaṃ naraka-gamanam |	Those who kill mother or father will certainly to to hell.
ataeva bhagavatā pratiṣiddho na mātā-pit-ghātakaḥ pravrājayitavyaḥ,	For this reason the Fortunate One did not allow the going-forth for one who had killed mother or father,
nāsti tasya pravrajyā nopasampadā, nāsti phala-prāptiḥ |	and for him who has gone forth, there is no higher ordination, and there is no attainment of fruit.
evaṃ-vidhaṃ varjayitvān, yathā sama-samā mātā-pitara ācāryopādhyāyāḥ |	In this way it is prevented, just as for mother and father, so it is the same for teacher and preceptor.
kathaṃ ca sama-samā?	How is it the same?
nanu bhagavatoktam:	Did not the Fortunate One say:
“mātā-pitroḥ putra-sneho yāvad asthi-majjām āśritya tiṣṭhaty,	“Mother and father have a love for a child that penetrates and remains as far as the bone-marrow,
ataeva mātā-pitbhyām ananujñātasya nāsti pravrajyā.”	for this reason without the permission of mother and father there is no going-forth.”
yathārya-rāṣṭrapāla-śoṇa-prabhtayo bhagavatā mātā-pitarāv ananujñāpya na pravrājitāḥ,	Just as the Fortunate One did not give the going-forth to the noble Rāṣṭrapāla, Śoṇa and others without (their respective) mother’s and father’s permission,
adyāpi tān ananujñātān na pravrājayanti |	and even today we do not give the going-forth without permission.
yathā ca bhagavati pravrajite śuddhodanasya putra-śokena cakṣuṣī antarhite |	Just as with the going-forth of the Fortunate One, (his father) Śuddhodana covered his eyes through grief for his son.
“mātā-pitaraḥ pañca sthānāni pratyāśaṃsamānāḥ putram icchanti:	“Considering these five reasons mother and father wish for a child:
śaṃvardhito no vddhī-bhūtān,	He will look after us when we are old,
pālayiṣyati kāryaṃ ca kariṣyati,	as he was protected so he will (protect us),
dravya-svāmī ca bhaviṣyati,	he will be master of our wealth,
kāla-gatānāṃ ca pit-piṇḍaṃ dāsyati,	when we have died he will make the ancestor offerings,
kula-vaṃśaś ca cirasthitiko bhaviṣyati |	he will preserve our family lineage.
imāni pañca sthānāni pratyāśaṃsamānā mātā-pitaraḥ putram icchanti |	These are the five reasons mother and father wish for a child.
naivam ācāryopādhyāyāḥ |	It is not so with teachers and preceptors.
kevalam eva kāruṇyam purasktya:	They act wholly out of kindness, (thinking):
“katham asyā nādi-kāla-pravttasya saṃsāra-cakrasya paryantaṃ kuryād” iti?	“How could he make an end to the stream of time that rolls on in this wheel of saṃsāra?”
yathā bhagavatā vinaya uktam:	As was said by the Fortunate One in the Discipline:
“upādhyāyasya śiṣye putra-saṃjñā bhavati,	“Preceptors (should) perceive their students as sons,
śiṣyasyāpy upādhyāye pit-saṃjñā bhavati,	and students (should) perceive their preceptors as fathers,
evam anyonya-niśritāḥ sukhino bhaviṣyanti.”	depending on each other in this way they will be happy.”
evam ācāryopādhyāyāḥ sama-samā mātā-pitbhiḥ |	In this way teacher and preceptor are the same as mother and father.
yathā cakravarti-sūtra uktam bhagavatā:	Just as the Fortunate One said in the Discourse about the Universal Monarch:
“kasya karmaṇo vipākena rājā cakravartī hasti-ratnāny aśva-ratnāni ca pratilabhate?”	“What is the deed having the result that the king, the universal monarch, receives elephant-jewels and horse-jewels?”
dīrgha-rātraṃ rājā cakravartī mātaram pitaraṃ vā svayaṃ vā skandhe, vahati vā rathādibhir vāhayati vā,	For a long time the king, the universal monarch, carried his mother and father on his shoulders, or had them transported in a chariot,
ācāryopādhyāyān svayaṃ vahati vāhayati vā |	or, he had his teacher and preceptor transported.
tasya karmaṇo vipākena rājā cakravartī hasty-aśva-ratnāni pratilabhate |	Because of this the result was that the king, the universal monarch, received elephant and horse jewels.
anenāpi kāraṇena sama-samā mātā-pitara ācāryopādhyāyāś ca |	For this reason mother and father are the same as teachers and preceptors.
api tv asty anyatra nānā-karaṇam:	There is another differentiation made:
ghasthānām mātā-pit pravrajitāḥ pūjyāḥ,	householders worship mother and father and those gone-forth,
pravrajitānām ācāryopādhyāyā eva pūjanīyāḥ |	but those gone-forth must worship (only) teachers and preceptors.
yathā mahīśāsakā gotrāntarīyā vinaye ’rthotpattiṃ dhārayanti:	Just as in the Mahīśāsaka lineage a different explanation has arisen and is remembered within their Discipline (thus):
“yathāha bhagavān,	“As the Fortunate One said,
‘na bhikṣavaḥ ācāryopādhyāyān anāpṣṭvā deśāntaraṃ gantavyam.’	‘Monastics, one should not go to another country without having first paid respects to your teacher and preceptor.
kasmād?	Why?
bhavati bhikṣavo jīvitāntarāyo bhavati brahmacaryāntarāyo bhavati pātra-cīvarāntarāyaḥ |	Monastics, there is an obstacle to life, an obstacle to the spiritual life, an obstacle to the bowl and robes.
bhūta-pūrvam bhikṣavo maitrāyajño nāma sārtha-vāha-putra āsīd iti…’ ”	Previously, monastics, there was a son of a caravan leader called Maitrāyajña…’ ”
etad evāvadānaṃ yathāvasthitaṃ vaktavyam |	This tradition is to be recited here, just as it is.
evam eva sama-samā ācāryopādhyāyā mātā-pitaraś ca |	In this way mother and father are the same as teachers and preceptors.
“yo bhikṣavo mātā-pitarau skandhena ghya jambudvīpam paryaṭeta,	“Monastics, whoever would roam around the Rose Apple Isle carrying his mother and father on his shoulders,
yogodvahanaṃ ca kuryāt, caturṣu dvīpeṣu hiraṇya-suvarṇaṃ ca dadyāt,	and would support them, and give them (all) the finest gold in the four continents,
evam api mātā-pitroḥ pratyupakāro na kto bhavati |	still would not have given back the help he had from his mother and father.
yaś ca punar buddhe prasādayet, dharme, saṃghe,	But whoever instils faith in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha,
pañcasu śikṣā-padeṣu ārya-kānteṣu śīleṣu pratiṣṭhāpayet,	and establishes them in the five virtuous precepts, beloved of the noble ones,
evam mātā-pitṝṇām putraiḥ pratyupakāraḥ kto bhavati.”	in this way a son would have given back the help he had from mother and father.”
tac ca sarvam ācāryopādhyāyāḥ kurvanti |	Teachers and preceptors do all this.
yathāha bhagavān dakṣiṇā-vibhaṅga-sūtre:	As is said by the Fortunate One in the discourse on the Analysis of Offerings:
“yath’ ānanda pudgalaḥ pudgalam āgamya buddhaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchati,	“Just as, Ānanda, a person who because of another person has gone for refuge to the Buddha,
dharmaṃ saṃghaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchati…”	has gone for refuge to the Dharma and the Saṅgha…”
yathoktāni ca śikṣāpadāni vaktavyāni |	The training rules should also be quoted.
“ten’ ānanda pudgalena tasya pudgalasya na śakyam pratikartum,	“Ānanda, that person is not able to repay the other person,
yad idam, abhivādana-pratyutthāna-mātreṇaivam.”	that is to say, with worship, rising up, or with loving-kindness.”
api prativiśiṣṭa-tarā ācāryopādhyāyā mātā-pitbhyām |	Thus teachers and preceptors are again more distinguished than mothers and fathers.
yathā ca mahākātyāyanenāvanti-prabhtayaḥ paścima-janapadā abhiprasāditāḥ |	Just as Mahākātyāyana entered Āvantī and converted the western countries.
yathā cārya-madhyandinena kāśmīrāyām pañca nāga-śatani vinīya deśo ’bhiprasāditaḥ,	Just as the noble Madhyandina tamed the five hundred nāgas in Kashmir and converted the district,
anavatapta-sarasaś ca kuṅkumam ānīya kaśmīrāyām pratiṣṭhāpitam,	and having brought saffron from lake Anavatapta and established it in Kashmir,
tac cādyāpi lokopabhuktam |	where it is still enjoyed in the world today.
vihāraś ca kārito ’dyāpi ca tatraiva prativasanti |	He also had a monastery built which is still inhabited today.
yathā ārya-gavāmpatinā suvarṇabhūmyāṃ yojana-śataṃ janapado ’bhiprasāditaḥ |	Just as the noble Gavāmpati converted the one-hundred league country (called) the Land of Gold.
yathā ca pūrva-videhā ārya-piṇḍola-bhāradvājenābhiprasāditā vihārāś ca kāritā adyāpi tatraiva prativasanti |	Just as the noble Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja converted the Eastern Videhas and had monasteries built which are still inhabited today.
yathā cārya-mahendreṇa siṃhala-dvīpe vibhīṣaṇa-prabhtayo rākṣasāḥ samaye sthāpitā deśaś cābhiprasāditaḥ |	Just as the noble Mahendra converted the fearsome rākṣasas with Vibhīṣaṇa at the fore in Śrī Laṅkā and at that time established the country (in faith).
yathā cādhyardha-śatake sūtra ārya-pūrṇena śūrpārake nagare pañcopāsaka-śatāni abhiprasāditāni,	Just as in the discourse on The One Hundred and Fifty the noble Pūrṇa converted the five hundred lay disciples in Śūrpāraka,
candana-mālaś ca vihāraḥ kāritaḥ |	and had the Sandalwood-forest monastery built.
yathā ca bhagavān, pañcabhir bhikṣu-śataiḥ sārdhaṃ, vihāyasā tatra gato jana-kāyaś cābhiprasāditaḥ |	Just as the Fortunate One, together with five hundred monastics, having gone through the air converted the people.
api ca kim ekaikasya bhikṣor nāma-grahaṇena ktena?	But why grasp at the names of these monastics?
yato bhagavān parinirva … ntar	Since the Fortunate One attained Nirvāṇa …
yaḥ kaścid vinīto bhikṣur vā bhikṣuṇī vopāsako vopāsikā vā	whatever monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen were guided
sarve te bhikṣubhir eva vinītāḥ |	they all were guided by the monastics.
yaś ca yenābhiprasāditaḥ sa tasyācāryopādhyāyāś ca eta	Whoever has converted him becomes for him a teacher and preceptor
…ta bhagavān:	…the Fortunate One (said):
“mātā-pitaraḥ pañca sthānāni pratyanuśaṃsamānāḥ putram icchanti…	“Considering these five reasons mother and father wish for a child…
ācāryopādhyāyās tu kāruṇyān nirvāṇaṃ dharmaṃ deśayanti |	But the teachers and preceptors out of kindness teach the Dharma (for the attainment) of Nirvāṇa.
anenāpi kāraṇena mātā-pitbhya ācāryopādhyāyāḥ prativiśiṣṭatarā” iti |	For this reason teachers and preceptors are more distinguished than mother and father.”
ata evam āha bhagavān:	This is the reason it was said by the Fortunate One:
“mama bhikṣavo vacanaṃ śraddadhānair bhagavati,	“Monastics, if you have faith in the words of the Fortunate One,
paraḥ prasādaḥ kāryaḥ dharme saṃghe,	you must have supreme faith in the Dharma and the Sangha,
mātā-pitṣv ācāryopādhyāyeṣu paraḥ prasādaḥ kāryaḥ |	you must have supreme faith in mother and father, teachers and preceptors.
tad vo bhaviṣyati dīrgha-rātraṃ hitāya sukhāyeti.”	That will be for your happiness and welfare for a long time.”
katamat karma, yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ, pūrvaṃ sukhito bhūtvā, paścād duḥkhito bhavati?	What is the deed, provided with which, a person first becomes happy, and later becomes unhappy?
ihaikatyo dānaṃ yācitaḥ, samānaḥ pūrvam prahṣṭaḥ pratijānīte, pramudito dadāti |	Being asked for a gift here, someone first happily approves, and rejoicing gives it.
dattvā ca khalu pratisārī bhavati |	But after giving he has regret.
sa yadā manuṣyeṣūpapadyate, āḍhyeṣu mahā-dhaneṣu mahā-bhogeṣu kuleṣūpapadyate,	When he is reborn amongst humans, he is reborn into a family which has great riches, great wealth,
paścāt tasya te bhogāḥ parikṣayam paryādānaṃ gacchanti, sa paścād daridro bhavati |	but later that wealth is lost and exhausted, (so that) he later becomes poor.
yathārya-gopakaḥ |	Like the noble Gopaka.
tena kila kakucchande samyak-sambuddhe bhikṣu-saṃghasya godhenur dattā |	It seems that at the time of the Fully Awakened Buddha Kakucchanda he gave a milch cow to the Saṅgha of monks.
sa paścāt parair garhito: “na sādhu-kteyaṃ datteti” |	Later others blamed him, (saying): “You did not do well in giving this.”
tena cittam pradūṣitam |	Through that his mind was corrupted.
sa yatra yatropapadyate, tatra tatra mahā-dhano bhavati,	Wherever he was reborn, in that place he (first) had great wealth,
paścāt, tena cittapradoṣeṇa, daridro bhavati |	but later, because of that corrupt mind, he became poor.
paścime bhave ’pi rājaghe nagare ’nyatarasmin ghe pratyājātaḥ,	In his last existence he was reborn in a certain house in the city of Rājagha,
tasya jāyamānasya mātā kāla-gatā, anena mātā māritā jāyamānena |	and through that birth his mother died, so his mother was killed through giving birth.
mūla-nakṣatre jāto ’yam |	He was born at the time of the Root lunar mansion.
“mā nirmūlaṃ kulaṃ kariṣyaty amaṅgalo ’yam,” iti	(Thinking:) “Let this family not be uprooted through this inauspicious (event),”
mātrā sārdhaṃ śmaśāne utsṣṭaḥ |	they abandoned (him) together with his mother in the charnel ground.
tatrāpi ca mātur eka-stanāt kṣīram pragharati tenaiva puṇyānubhāvena |	Through the power of his merit milk flowed from one of his mother’s breasts (and he lived on).
vivddhaś ca bhagavatā gatya pravrājitaḥ |	When he had grown up he went-forth under the Fortunate One.
etac ca sarvam anupūrveṇa bhagavatā bhikṣūṇāṃ kathitam |	Previously this whole story was told to the monastics by the Fortunate One.
evam anena pūrvaṃ kṣīra-dhenuḥ prasāda-jātena dattā,	Thus he first gave a milch cow and through this faith arose,
paścād vipratisārī saṃvttaḥ, tasyedaṃ karma-phalam |	and later he was angry, and this was the fruit of that deed.
yas tv asau pūrvakaś citta-prasādas tad evāsya mokṣa-bījam |	So he previously through a mind full of faith (planted) the seed of release.
yathā ca campāyām mahā-nagaryām īśvaro gha-pati-putraḥ |	Just as the householder’s son Īśvara
tena bhtyānāṃ haste sarvaṃ dhanaṃ catur-diśam bāṇijyāya preṣitam |	With his hand he (had given) all his wealth to his dependents and dispatched them as merchants in the four directions.
tac ca sarvaṃ deśāntara-gataṃ vinaṣṭam,	Having gone to another country all was lost,

te ca sahetupratyayā utpadyanti sahetupratyayā nirudhyanti |	they arise with causes and conditions, and they cease with causes and conditions.
sahetudṛṣṭī bhavābhavadṛṣṭī,	There is the view about causes, and the view about continuity in existence,
‘sahetusaṃskārasamudayaṃ’ bhikṣavo yathābhūtaṃ samyakprajñayā paśyato	‘with causes processes arise’, monks, seeing this with right wisdom as it really is
yā bhavadṛṣṭi śāśvatadṛṣṭi sā na bhavati;	there will be no existence-view or eternity-view;

yā vibhavadṛṣṭi, ucchedadṛṣṭi sāpi na bhavati |	there will be no extinction view, or annihilation view.
tena bhikṣavo ubhau antau anugamya madhyena tathāgato dharmaṃ deśayati:	So not having approached either of these two extremes, monks, the Realised One teaches the Dhamma which is a middle practice (thus):
avidyāpratyayā saṃskārā,	Because of ignorance there are (volitional) processes,
saṃskārapratyayaṃ vijñānaṃ,	because of (volitional) processes: consciousness,
vijñānapratyayaṃ nāmarūpaṃ,	because of consciousness: mind and body,
nāmarūpapratyayaṃ ṣaḍāyatanaṃ,	because of mind and body: the six sense spheres,

jātipratyayā jarāmaraṇaśokaparidevaduḥkhadaurmanasyopayāsā |	because of birth: old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair.
evam-asya [kevalasya]	And so there is an origination of this [whole] great mass of suffering.
iti pi avidyānirodhāt-saṃskāranirodhaḥ,	From the cessation of ignorance, there is the cessation of (volitional) processes,
saṃskāranirodhād-vijñānanirodho,	from the cessation of (volitional) processes, the cessation of consciousness,
vijñānanirodhān-nāmarūpanirodho,	from the cessation of consciousness, the cessation of mind and body,
nāmarūpanirodhāt ṣaḍāyatananirodhaḥ,	from the cessation of mind and body, the cessation of the six sense spheres,

sparśanirodhād-vedanānirodho,	from the cessation of contact, the cessation of feeling,
vedanānirodhāt-tṛṣṇānirodhaḥ,	from the cessation of feeling, the cessation of craving,
tṛṣṇānirodhād-upādānanirodhaḥ,	from the cessation of craving, the cessation of attachment,
upādānanirodhad-bhavanirodhāḥ,	from the cessation of attachment, the cessation of continuation,
bhavanirodhaj-jātinirodho,	from the cessation of continuation, the cessation of birth,
jātinirodhaj-jarāmaraṇanirodho,	from the cessation of birth, the cessation of old age and death,
jarāmaraṇanirodho śokaparidevaduḥkhadaurmanasyopayāsā nirodhyante,	from the cessation of old age and death,
evam-asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati |	and so there is a cessation of this whole great mass of suffering.

na saṃbodhaye na nirvāṇāya saṃvartate;	Complete Awakening, and Emancipation;
yā ceyam-amadhyamā pratipad-ātmakāyaklamathānuyogo	and this, which is not the middle practice: devotion to self-mortification, which is painful, not connected with the goal,

etau ca bhikṣavo dvāvantāvanupagamya	Not having approached either of these two extremes, monks,
madhyamayaiva pratipadā tathāgato dharmaṃ deśayati, yaduta:	the Doctrine of the middle practice is being taught by the Realised One, which is this:
samyag-dṛṣṭiḥ	right view
samyak-saṃkalpaḥ	right thought
samyag-vāk-	right speech
samyak-karmāntaḥ	right action
samyag-ājīvaḥ	right livelihood

tatra katamo duḥkhasamudayaḥ?	Herein, what is the arising of suffering?

ayam-ucyate duḥkhasamudayaḥ |	This is said to be the arising of suffering.
tatra katamo duḥkhanirodhaḥ?	Herein, what is the cessation of suffering?
yo 'syā eva tṛṣṇāyāḥ punar-bhavikyā nandīrāgasahagatāyās-tatra-tatrābhinandinyā	It is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of the birth of that craving, which greatly enjoys this and that,

yoniśo manasikurvato evaṃ triparivartaṃ dvādaśākāraṃ,	reflected upon wisely and turned like this, in three ways, twelvefold,
jñānadarśanam-utpadyate, na tāvad-ahaṃ bhikṣavo 'nuttarāṃ	knowledge and insight was (still) arising, for that long, monks, I did not declare
samyak-saṃbodhim-abhisaṃbuddho 'smi iti pratijñāsiṣam;	that I was fully awakened with unsurpassed complete awakening;
