The efforts of Cārvāka are indeed hard to be eradicated, for the majority of living beings hold by the current refrain—
prāyeṇa sarvaprāṇinastāvat yāvajjīvaṃ sukhaṃ jīvennāsti mṛtyoragocaraḥ|	While life is yours, live joyously; None can escape Death's searching eye:

ata eva tasya cārvākamatasya lokāyatamityanvarthamaparaṃ nāmadheyam|	Hence another name for that school is Lokāyata,—a name well accordant with the thing signified.[1]
tatra pṛthivyādīni bhūtāni catvāri tattvāni| tebhya eva dehākārapariṇatebhyaḥ kiṇvādibhyo madaśaktivaccaitanyamupajāyate|	In this school the four elements, earth, &c., are the original principles; from these alone, when transformed into the body, intelligence is produced, just as the inebriating power is developed from the mixing of certain ingredients;[2] and when these are destroyed, intelligence at once perishes also.
teṣu vinaṣṭeṣu satsu svayaṃ vinaśyati|	They quote the Śruti for this [Bṛhad Āraṇy.

aṅganādyāliṅganādijanyaṃ sukhameva puruṣārthaḥ|	The only end of man is enjoyment produced by sensual pleasures.

tasmād duḥkhabhayānnānukū lavedanīyaṃ sukhaṃ tyaktu mucitam|	It is not therefore for us, through a fear of pain, to reject the pleasure which our nature instinctively recognises as congenial.
na hi mṛgāḥ santīti śālayo nopyante| na hi bhikṣukāḥ santīti sthālyo nādhiśrīyante|	Men do not refrain from sowing rice, because forsooth there are wild animals to devour it; nor do they refuse to set the cooking-pots on the fire, because forsooth there are beggars to pester us for a share of the contents.
yadi kaścidbhīrurddaṣṭaṃ sukhaṃ tyajettārhi sa paśuvanmurkhoṃ bhavet|	If any one were so timid as to forsake a visible pleasure, he would indeed be foolish like a beast, as has been said by the poet—
taduktam - tyājyaṃ sukhaṃ viṣayasaṃgamajanma puṃsāṃ duḥkhopasṛṣṭamiti mūrkhavicāraṇaiṣā|	The pleasure which arises to men from contact with sensible objects, Is to be relinquished as accompanied by pain,—such is the reasoning of fools;
brīhīñijihā sati sitottamataṇḍu lāḍhayān ko nāma bhostupakaṇopahitānhitārthī||	The berries of paddy, rich with the finest white grains, What man, seeking his true interest, would fling away because covered with husk and dust?[4]

tathā cābhāṇakaḥ- agnihotraṃ trayo vedāstridaṇḍaṃ bhasmaguṇṭhanam|	The Agnihotra, the three Vedas, the ascetic's three staves, and smearing oneself with ashes,—
buddhipauruṣahīnānāṃ jīvike ti vṛhaspatiḥ||iti||	Bṛhaspati says, these are but means of livelihood for those who have no manliness nor sense.
ata eva kaṇṭakādijanyaṃ duḥkhameva narakaḥ| lokasiddho rājā parameśvaraḥ| dehocche do mokṣaḥ|	Hence it follows that there is no other hell than mundane pain produced by purely mundane causes, as thorns, &c.; the only Supreme is the earthly monarch whose existence is proved by all the world's eyesight; and the only Liberation is the dissolution of the body.
dehātmavāde ca sthūlo'haṃ kṛśo'haṃ kṛṣṇo'hamityādisāmānādhikaraṇyopapattiḥ| mama śarīramiti vyavahāro rāhoḥ śira ityādivadaupacārikaḥ|	By holding the doctrine that the soul is identical with the body, such phrases as "I am thin," "I am black," &c., are at once intelligible, as the attributes of thinness, &c., and self-consciousness will reside in the same subject [the body]; like and the use of the phrase "my body" is metaphorical "the head of Rāhu" [Rāhu being really all head].
tadetatsarvaṃ samagrāhi- aṅganāliṅganājjanyasukhameva pumarthatā|	All this has been thus summed up—
atra catvāri bhūtāni bhūmivāryanalānilāḥ|	In this school there are four elements, earth, water, fire, and air;
caturbhyaḥ khalu bhūtebhyaścaitanyamupajāyate||3||	And from these four elements alone is intelligence produced,—
kiṇvādibhyaḥ sametebhyo dravyebhyo madaśaktivat ahaṃ sthūlaḥ kṛśo'smīti sāmānādhi- karaṇyataḥ||4||	Just like the intoxicating power from kiṇva, &c., mixed together; Since in "I am fat," "I am lean," these attributes[6] abide in the same subject,
dehaḥ sthaulyādiyogācca sa evātmā na cāparaḥ|	And since fatness, &c., reside only in the body,[7] it alone is the soul and no other,
mama deho'yamityuktiḥ saṃbhavedaupacārikī||5||iti syādetat|	And such phrases as "my body" are only significant metaphorically.

tadetanmanorājyavijṛmbhaṇam|	All this, however, is only the inflation of the world of fancy.

kiṃ tu jñātatayā| kaḥ khalu jñānopāyo bhavet|	What then is the means of this connection's being known?
na tāvatpratyakṣam|	We will first show that it is not perception.
tacca bāhyamāntaraṃ vā'bhimatam|	Now perception is held to be of two kinds, external and internal [i.e., as produced by the external senses, or by the inner sense, mind].

nāpi caramaḥ| antaḥkaraṇasya bahirindriyatantratvena bāhye'rthe svātantryeṇa pravṛttyanupapatteḥ| taduktam - cakṣurādyuktaviṣayaṃ paratantraṃ bahirmanaḥ|	Nor is internal perception the means, since you cannot establish that the mind has any power to act independently towards an external object, since all allow that it is dependent on the external senses, as has been said by one of the logicians, "The eye, &c., have their objects as described; but mind externally is dependent on the others."
nāpyanumānaṃ vyāptijñānopāyaḥ| tatratatrāpyevamityanavasthādausthyaprasaṅgāt|	Nor can inference be the means of the knowledge of the universal proposition, since in the case of this inference we should also require another inference to establish it, and so on, and hence would arise the fallacy of an ad infinitum retrogression.

upamānādikaṃ tu dūrāpāstam|	[which, of course, we Cārvākas reject].
teṣāṃ saṃjñāsaṃjñisaṃbandhādibodhakatvenānaupādhikasaṃbandhabodhakatvāsaṃbhavāt|	Then again comparison,[14] &c., must be utterly rejected as the means of the knowledge of the universal proposition, since it is impossible that they can produce the knowledge of the unconditioned connection [i.e., the universal proposition], because their end is to produce the knowledge of quite another connection, viz., the relation of a name to something so named.
upādhīnāṃ pratyakṣatvaniyamāsaṃbhavena pratyakṣāṇāmabhāvasya pratyakṣatve'pyapratyakṣāṇāmabhāvasyāpratyakṣatayānumānadyapekṣāyāmuktadūṣaṇānativṛtteḥ| api ca sādhanāvyāpakatve sati sādhyasamavyāptiriti tallakṣaṇaṃ kakṣīkartavyam| taduktam - avyāptasādhano yaḥ sādhyasamavyāptirucyate sa upādhiḥ|	Again, this same absence of a condition,[15] which has been given as the definition of an invariable connection [i.e., a universal proposition], can itself never be known; since it is impossible to establish that all conditions must be objects of perception; and therefore, although the absence of perceptible things may be itself perceptible, the absence of non-perceptible things must be itself non-perceptible; and thus, since we must here too have recourse to inference, &c., we cannot leap over the obstacle which has already been planted to bar them.

These three distinguishing clauses, "not constantly accompanying the middle term," "constantly accompanying the major term," and "being constantly accompanied by it" [i.e., reciprocal], are needed in the full definition to stop respectively three such fallacious conditions, in the argument to prove the non-eternity of sound, as "being produced," "the nature of a jar," and "the not causing audition;"[17] wherefore the definition holds,—and again it is established by the śloka of the great Doctor beginning samāsama.[18]
tatra vidhyadhyavasāyapūrvakatvāniṣedhādhyavasāyasyopādhijñāne jāte tadabhāvaviśiṣṭasaṃbandharūpa- vyāptijñānaṃ vyāptijñānādhīnaṃ copādhijñānamiti parasparāśrayavajraprahāradoṣo vajralepāyate|	But since the knowledge of the condition must here precede the knowledge of the condition's absence, it is only when there is the knowledge of the condition, that the knowledge of the universality of the proposition is possible, i.e., a knowledge in the form of such a connection between the middle term and major term as is distinguished by the absence of any such condition; and on the other hand, the knowledge of the condition depends upon the knowledge of the invariable connection.
tasmādavinābhāvasya durbodhatayānānumānādyavakāśaḥ|	Hence by the impossibility of knowing the universality of a proposition it becomes impossible to establish inference, &c.[19]
dhūmādijñānānantara- magnyādijñāne pravṛttiḥ pratyakṣamūlatayā bhrāntyā vā yujyate| kvacitphalapratilambhastu maṇimantrauṣadhādivadyādṛcchikaḥ|	The step which the mind takes from the knowledge of smoke, &c., to the knowledge of fire, &c., can be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being an error; and that in some cases this step is justified by the result, is accidental just like the coincidence of effects observed in the employment of gems, charms, drugs, &c.
atastatsādhyamadṛṣṭādikamapi nāsti|	From this it follows that fate, &c.,[20] do not exist, since these can only be proved by inference.
nanvadṛṣṭaniṣṭau jagadvaicitryamākasmikaṃ syāditi cet- na tadbhadram|	But an opponent will say, if you thus do not allow adṛṣṭa, the various phenomena of the world become destitute of any cause.
svabhāvādeva tadupapatteḥ|	But we cannot accept this objection as valid, since these phenomena can all be produced spontaneously from the inherent nature of things.
taduktam - agniruṣṇo jalaṃ śītaṃ samasparśastathānilaḥ|	Thus it has been said— The fire is hot, the water cold, refreshing cool the breeze of morn;
ke nedaṃ citritaṃ tasmātsvabhāvāttadvayavasthitiḥ|	By whom came this variety? from their own nature was it born.
tadetatsarvaṃ bṛhaspatināpyuktam- na svargoṃ nāpavargoṃ vā naivā''tmā pāralaukikaḥ|	And all this has been also said by Bṛhaspati— There is no heaven, no final liberation, nor any soul in another world,
naiva varṇāśramādīnāṃ kriyāśca phaladāyikāḥ||1||	Nor do the actions of the four castes, orders, &c., produce any real effect.
agnihotraṃ trayo vedāstridaṇḍaṃ bhasmaguṇṭhanam|	The Agnihotra, the three Vedas, the ascetic's three staves, and smearing one's self with ashes,
buddhi- pauruṣahīnānāṃ jīvikā dhātunirmitā||2||	Were made by Nature as the livelihood of those destitute of knowledge and manliness.
paśuścennihataḥ svargaṃ jyotiṣṭome gamiṣyati|	If a beast slain in the Jyotiṣṭoma rite will itself go to heaven,
svapitā yajamānena tatra kasmānna hiṃsyate||3||	Why then does not the sacrificer forthwith offer his own father?[21]
mṛtānāmāpi jantūnāṃ śrāddhaṃ cettṛptikāraṇam|	If the Śrāddha produces gratification to beings who are dead,
gacchatāmiha jantūnāṃ vyarthaṃ pātheyakalpanam| gehasthakṛtaśrāddhena pathi tṛptiravāritā||5|| svargāsthitā yadā tṛptiṃ gacche yustatra dānataḥ|	Then here, too, in the case of travellers when they start, it is needless to give provisions for the journey. If beings in heaven are gratified by our offering the Śrāddha here,
prāsādasyoparisthānāmatra kasmānna dīyate||6||	Then why not give the food down below to those who are standing on the housetop?
yāvajjīvetsukhaṃ jīvedṛṇaṃ kṛtvā ghṛtaṃ pibet|	While life remains let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee even though he runs in debt;
bhasmībhūtasya dehasya punarāgamanaṃ ku taḥ||7||	When once the body becomes ashes, how can it ever return again?
yadi gacche tparaṃ lokaṃ dehādeṣa vinirgataḥ|	If he who departs from the body goes to another world,
kasmādbhūyo na cāyāti bandhusnehasamāku laḥ||8||	How is it that he comes not back again, restless for love of his kindred?
tataśca jīvanopāyo brāhmaṇairvihitastviha|	Hence it is only as a means of livelihood that Brahmans have established here
mṛtānāṃ pretakāryāṇi na tvanyadvidyate kvacit||	All these ceremonies for the dead,—there is no other fruit anywhere.
trayo vedasya kartāro bhaṇḍadhūrtaniśācarāḥ|	The three authors of the Vedas were buffoons, knaves, and demons.
jarpharīturpharītyādi paṇḍitānāṃ vacaḥ smṛtam||	All the well-known formulæ of the pandits, jarpharī, turpharī, &c.[22]
aśvasyātra hi śiśnaṃ tu patnīgrāhyaṃ prakīrtitam|	And all the obscene rites for the queen commanded in the Aśvamedha,
bhaṇḍaistadvatparaṃ caiva grāhyajātaṃ prakīrtitam||	These were invented by buffoons, and so all the various kinds of presents to the priests,[23]
mānānāṃ khādanaṃ tadvanniśācarasamīritam||	While the eating of flesh was similarly commanded by night-prowling demons.
tasmādvahūnāṃ prāṇināmamugrahārthaṃ cārvākamatamāśrayaṇīyamiti ramaṇīyam||	Hence in kindness to the mass of living beings must we fly for refuge to the doctrine of Cārvāka.
atra bauddhairabhidhīyate|	Such is the pleasant consummation.

(nyā.vi.) iti|	It has accordingly been said—
anvayavyatirekāvavinā bhāvaniścāyakāviti pakṣe sādhyasādhanayau ravyabhicāro duravadhāraṇo bhavet| bhūte bhaviṣyati vartamāne cānupalabhyamānerthe vyabhicāraśaṅkāyā anivāraṇāt|	On the hypothesis (of the Naiyāyikas) that it is concomitance and non-concomitance (e.g., A is where B is, A is not where B is not) that determine an invariable connection, the unconditional attendance of the major or the middle term would be unascertainable, it being impossible to exclude all doubt with regard to instances past and future, and present but unperceived.
nanu tathāvidhasthale tāvake'pi mate vyabhicāraśaṅkā duṣparihareti cet maivaṃ vocaḥ| vināpi kāraṇaṃ kāryamutpadyatāmitvevaṃvidhāyāḥ śaṅkāyā vyāghātāvadhikatayā nivṛttatvāt| tadeva hyāśaṅkayeta yasminnāśaṅkayamāne vyādhātādayo nāvatareyuḥ| taduktam - vyādhātāvadhirāśaṅkā (nyā.ku su.3/7) iti|	If one (a Naiyāyika) rejoin that uncertainty in regard to such instances is equally inevitable on our system, we reply: Say not so, for such a supposition as that an effect may be produced without any cause would destroy itself by putting a stop to activity of any kind; for such doubts alone are to be entertained, the entertainment of which does not implicate us in practical absurdity and the like, as it has been said, "Doubt terminates where there is a practical absurdity."[2]
tasmāttadutpattiniścayenāvinābhāvo niścīyate| tadutpatti niścayaśca kāryahetvoḥ pratyakṣopalambhānupalambhapañcakanibandhanaḥ|	By ascertainment of an effectuation, then, of that (viz., of the designate of the middle) is ascertained the invariable concomitance (of the major); and the ascertainment of such effectuation may arise from the well-known series of five causes, in the perceptive cognition or non-cognition of cause and effect.
kāryasyotpatteḥ prāganupalambhaḥ kāraṇopalambhe satyupalambhaḥ upalabdhasya paścātkāraṇānupalambhādanupalambhaḥ iti pañcakāraṇyā dhūmadhūmadhvajayoḥ kāryakāraṇabhāvo niścīyate|	That fire and smoke, for instance, stand in the relation of cause and effect is ascertained by five indications, viz., (1.) That an effect is not cognised prior to its effectuation, that (2.) the cause being perceived (3.) the effect is perceived, and that after the effect is cognised (4.) there is its non-cognition, (5.) when the (material) cause is no longer cognised.
tathā tādātmyaniścayenāpyavinābhāvo niścīyate| yadi śiṃśapā vṛkṣatvamatipatetsvātmānameva jahyāditi vipakṣe bādhakapravṛtteḥ|	In like manner an invariable concomitance is ascertained by the ascertainment of identity (e.g., a sisu-tree is a tree, or wherever we observe the attributes of a sisu we observe also the attribute arboreity), an absurdity attaching to the contrary opinion, inasmuch as if a sisu-tree should lose its arboreity it would lose its own self.
apravṛtte tu bādhake bhūyaḥ sahabhāvopalambhe'pi vyabhicāraśaṅkāyāḥ ko nivārayitā| śiṃśapāvṛkṣayośca tādātmyaniścayo vṛkṣo'yaṃ śiṃśapeti sāmānādhikaraṇyabalādupapadyate|	But, on the other hand, where there exists no absurdity, and where a (mere) concomitance is again and again observed, who can exclude all doubt of failure in the concomitance? An ascertainment of the identity of sisu and tree is competent in virtue of the reference to the same object (i.e., predication),—This tree is a sisu.
na hyatyantābhede tatsaṃbhavati| paryāyatvena yugapatprayogāyogāt| nāpyatyantabhede| gavāśvayoranupalambhāt|	For reference to the same object (predication) is not competent where there is no difference whatever (e.g., to say, "A jar is a jar," is no combination of diverse attributes in a common subject), because the two terms cannot, as being synonymous, be simultaneously employed; nor can reference to the same object take place where there is a reciprocal exclusion (of the two terms), inasmuch as we never find, for instance, horse and cow predicated the one of the other.
tasmātkāryātmānau kāraṇātmānāvanumāpayata iti siddham|	It has thus been evinced that an effect or a self-same supposes a cause or a self-same (as invariable concomitants).
yadi kaścitprāmāṇyamanumānasya nāṅgīkuryāttaṃ prati vrūyāt| anumānaṃ pramāṇaṃ na bhavatītyetāvanmātramucyate tatra na kiṃ cana sādhanamupanyasyata upanyasyate vā| na prathamaḥ|	If a man does not allow that inference is a form of evidence, pramāṇa, one may reply: You merely assert thus much, that inference is not a form of evidence: do you allege no proof of this, or do you allege any? The former alternative is not allowable according to the maxim that bare assertion is no proof of the matter asserted.

kiṃ ca pramāṇatadābhāsavyavasthāpanaṃ tatsamānajātīyatvāditi vadatā bhavataiva svīkṛtaṃ svabhāvānumānam|	Besides, when you affirm that the establishment of a form of evidence and of the corresponding fallacious evidence results from their homogeneity, you yourself admit induction by identity.
paragatā vipratipattistu vacanaliṅgeneti bruvatā kāryaliṅgakamanumānam|	Again, when you affirm that the dissentiency of others is known by the symbolism of words, you yourself allow induction by causality.
anupalabdhyākaṃ cidarthaṃ pratiṣedhayatānupalabdhiliṅga- kamanumānam|	When you deny the existence of any object on the ground of its not being perceived, you yourself admit an inference of which non-perception is the middle term.
tathā coktaṃ tathāgataiḥ - pramāṇāntarasāmānyasthiteranyadhiyo gateḥ|	Conformably it has been said by Tathāgata— "The admission of a form of evidence in general results from its being present to the understanding of others.
pramāṇāntarasadbhāvaḥ pratiṣedhācca kasyacit|	"The existence of a form of evidence also follows from its negation by a certain person."
parākrāntaṃ cātra sūribhiriti granthabhūyastvabhayāduparamya te|	All this has been fully handled by great authorities; and we desist for fear of an undue enlargement of our treatise.

sarvaṃ kṣaṇikaṃ kṣaṇikaṃ duḥkhaṃ duḥkhaṃ svalakṣaṇaṃ sva lakṣaṇaṃ śūnyaṃ śūnyamiti bhāvanācatuṣṭayamupadiṣṭaṃ draṣṭavyam|	It is to be borne in mind that four points of view have been laid out, viz., (1.) All is momentary, momentary; (2.) all is pain, pain; (3.) all is like itself alone; (4.) all is void, void.
tatra kṣaṇikatvaṃ nīlādikṣaṇānāṃ sattvenānumātavyaṃ yatsattatkṣaṇikaṃ yathā jaladharapaṭalaṃ santaścāmī bhāvā iti| na cāyamasiddho hetuḥ| arthakriyākāritvalakṣaṇasya sattvasya nīlādikṣaṇānāṃ pratyakṣasiddhatvāt| vyāpakavyāvṛtyā vyāpyavyāvṛttiriti nyāyena vyāpakakramākramavyāvṛttāvakṣakṣikātsattvavyāvṛtteḥ siddhatvācca|	Of these points of view, the momentariness of fleeting things, blue and so forth (i.e., whatever be their quality), is to be inferred from their existence; thus, whatever is is momentary (or fluxional) like a bank of clouds, and all these things are.[4] Nor may any one object that the middle term (existence) is unestablished; for an existence consisting of practical efficiency is established by perception to belong to the blue and other momentary things; and the exclusion of existence from that which is not momentary is established, provided that we exclude from it the non-momentary succession and simultaneity, according to the rule that exclusion of the continent is exclusion of the contained.
taccarthakriyākāritvaṃ kramākramābhyāṃ vyāptam| na ca kramākramābhyāmanyaḥ prakāraḥ saṃbhavati|	Now this practical efficiency (here identified with existence) is contained under succession and simultaneity, and no medium is possible between succession and non-succession (or simultaneity); there being a manifest absurdity in thinking otherwise, according to the rule—
parasparavirodhe hi na prakārāntarasthitiḥ|	"In a reciprocal contradiction there exists no ulterior alternative;
naikatā'piviruddhānāmuktimātravirodhataḥ||	"Nor is their unity in contradictories, there being a repugnance in the very statement."[5]
tau ca kramākramau sthāyinaḥ sakāśād vyāvartamānā- varthakriyāmapi vyāvartayantau kṣaṇikatvapakṣa eva sattvaṃ vyavasthāpayata iti siddham|	And this succession and simultaneity being excluded from the permanent, and also excluding from the permanent all practical efficiency, determine existence of the alternative of momentariness.—q.e.d.
nanvakṣaṇikasyātharkri yākāritvaṃ kiṃ na syāditi cet- tadayuktam|	Perhaps some one may ask: Why may not practical efficiency reside in the non-fluxional (or permanent)? If so, this is wrong, as obnoxious to the following dilemma.
vikalpāsahatvāt|	Such is the contradiction.
tathā hi vartamānātharkri yākaraṇakāletītā nāgatayoḥ kimarthakriyayoḥ sthāyinaḥ sāmarthyamasti no vā|	If so, we would ask you to explain: Do the subsidiaries assist the entity or not? If they do not, they are not required; for if they do nothing, they can have nothing to do with the successive exertion.
samarthasya kṣepāyogāt| yadyadā yatkaraṇasamarthaṃ tattadā tatkarotyeva yathā sāmagrī svakāryaṃ samarthaścāyaṃ bhāva iti prasaṅgānumānācca| dvitīye kadāpi na ku ryāt sāmārthyamātrānubandhitvādarthakriyākāritvasya|	If they do assist the thing, is this assistance (or supplementation) other than the thing or not? If it is other than the thing, then this adscititious (assistance) is the cause, and the non-momentary entity is not the cause: for the effect will then follow, by concomitance and non-concomitance, the adventitious supplementation.
nanu krama vatsahakārilābhātsthāyino'tītānāgatayoḥ krameṇa karaṇamupapadyata iti cet- tatredaṃ bhavānpṛṣṭo vyācaṣṭām|	Thus it has been said:
sahakāriṇaḥ kiṃ bhāvasyo paku rvanti na vā|	"What have rain and shine to do with the soul? Their effect is on the skin of man;
atha bhāvastaiḥ sahakāribhiḥ sahaiva kāryaṃ karotīti svabhāva iti cet| aṅga tarhi sahakāriṇo na jahyāt|	"If the soul were like the skin, it would be non-permanent; and if the skin were like the soul, there could be no effect produced upon it."
bhedapakṣa āgantukasyaiva tasya kāraṇatvaṃ syāt|	Perhaps you will say: The entity produces its effect, together with its subsidiaries.
na bhāvasyākṣaṇikasya āgantukātiśayānvayavyatirekānuvidhāyitvātkāryasya| taduktam - varṣātapābhyāṃ kiṃ vyomnaścarmaṇyasti tayoḥ phalam|	Well, then (we reply), let the entity not give up its subsidiaries, but rather tie them lest they fly with a rope round their neck, and so produce the effect which it has to produce, and without forfeiting its own proper nature.
kiṃ ca sahakārijanyo'tiśayaḥ kimatiśayāntaramārabhate na vā| ubhayathā'pi prāguktadūṣaṇapāṣāṇavarṣaṇaprasaṅgaḥ|	Besides (we continue), does the additament (or supplementation) constituted by the subsidiaries give rise to another additament or not? In either case the afore-mentioned objections will come down upon you like a shower of stones.
atiśayāntarārambhapakṣe bahumukhānavasthādau ḥsthyamapi syāt|	On the alternative that the additament takes on another additament, you will be embarrassed by a many-sided regress in infinitum.
atiśaye janayitavye saha kāryantarāpekṣāyāṃ tatparamparāpāta ityekānavasthāstheyā|	If when the additament is to be generated another auxiliary (or additament) be required, there will ensue an endless series of such additaments: this must be confessed to be one infinite regress.
tathā sahakāribhiḥ salilapavanādibhiḥ padārthasārthairādhīyamāne bījasyātiśaye bījamutpādakamabhyupeyam|	For example, let a seed be granted to be productive when an additament is given, consisting of a complement of objects such as water, wind, and the like, as subsidiaries; otherwise an additament would be manifested without subsidiaries.
aparathā tadabhāvepyatiśayaḥ prādurbhavet| bījaṃ cātiśayamādadhānaṃ sahakārisāpekṣamevādhatte| anyathā sarvadoṣakārāpattāvaṅku rasyāpi sadodayaḥ prasajyeta|	Now the seed in taking on the additament takes it on with the need of (ulterior) subsidiaries; otherwise, as there would always be subsidiaries, it would follow that a germ would always be arising from the seed.
tasmādatiśayārthamapekṣyamāṇaiḥ sahakāribhirati- śayāntaramādheyaṃ bīje|	We shall now have to add to the seed another supplementation by subsidiaries themselves requiring an additament.
tasminnapyupakāre pūrvanyāyena sahakārisāpekṣasya bījasya janakatve sahakārisaṃpādyabījagatātiśayānavasthāprathamā vyavasthitā|	If when this additament is given, the seed be productive only on condition of subsidiaries as before, there will be established an infinite regression of additaments to (or supplementations of) the seed, to be afforded by the subsidiaries.
athopakāraḥ kāryārthamapekṣyamāṇo'pi bījādinirapekṣaṃ kāryaṃ janayati tatsāpekṣaṃ vā| prathame bījāderahetutvamāpatet|	Again, we ask, does the supplementation required for the production of the effect produce its effect independently of the seed and the like, or does it require the seed and the like? On the first alternative (if the supplementation works independently), it would ensue that the seed is in no way a cause.
dvitīyepekṣyamāṇena bījādinopakāre'tiśaya ādheyaḥ| evaṃ tatratatrāpīti bījādijanyātiśayaniṣṭhātiśayaparamparāpāta iti dvitīyānavasthā sthirā bhavet|	On the second (if the supplementation require the seed), the seed, or whatever it may be that is thus required, must take on a supplementation or additament, and thus there will be over and over again an endless series of additaments added to the additament constituted by the seed; and thus a second infinite regression is firmly set up.
evamapekṣyamāṇenopakāreṇa bījādau dharmiṇyupakārāntaramādheya- tamityupakārādheyabījāśrayātiśayaparamparāpāta iti tṛtīyānavasthā duravasthā syāt|	In like manner the subsidiary which is required will add another subsidiary to the seed, or whatever it may be that is the subject of the additions, and thus there will be an endless succession of additaments added to the additaments to the seed which is supplemented by the subsidiaries; and so a third infinite regression will add to your embarrassment.
atha bhāvādabhinno'tiśayaḥ sahakāribhirādhīyata ityabhyupagamyate tarhi parācīno bhāvo'natiśayātmā nivṛtto'nyaścātiśayātmāku rvadrapādipadavedūnīyo jāyata iti phalitaṃ mamāpi manorathadrameṇa|	If so, the former entity, that minus the supplementation, is no more, and a new entity identical with the supplementation, and designated (in the technology of Buddhism) kurvad rūpa (or effect-producing object), comes into being: and thus the tree of my desires (my doctrine of a universal flux) has borne its fruit.
u tasmātkrameṇākṣaṇikasyārthakriyā durghaṭā|	Practical efficiency, therefore, in the non-momentary is inadmissible.
nāpyakrameṇa ghaṭate| vikalpāsahatvāt|	Nor is practical efficiency possible apart from succession in time; for such a possibility is redargued by the following dilemma.
tathāhi| yugapatsakalakāryakaraṇasamarthaḥ svabhāva- staduttarakālamanuvartate na vā| prathame tatkālavatkālāntarepi tāvatkāryakaraṇamāpatet| dvitīye sthāyitva vṛtyāśā mūṣikabhakṣitabījādāvaṅku rādijananaprārthanāmanuharet|	Is this (permanent) entity (which you contend for) able to produce all its effects simultaneously, or does it continue to exist after production of effects? On the former alternative, it will result that the entity will produce its effects just as much at one time as at another; on the second alternative, the expectation of its permanency is as reasonable as expecting seed eaten by a mouse to germinate.
yadviruddhadharmādhyastaṃ tannānā yathā śītoṣṇe| viruddhadharmādhyastaścāyamiti jaladhare pratibandhasiddhiḥ|	That to which contrary determinations are attributed is diverse, as heat and cold; but this thing is determined by contrary attributions.
na cāyamasiddho hetuḥ sthāyini kālabhedena sāmarthyāsāmarthyayoḥ prasaṅgatadviparyayasiddhatvāt|	Nor is the middle term disallowable, for possession and privation of power and impotence are allowed in regard to the permanent (which you assert) at different times.
tatrāsāmarthyasādhakau prasaṅgatadviparyayau prāguktau| sāmarthyasādhakāvabhidhīyete|	The concomitance and non-concomitance already described (viz., That which can at any time do anything does not fail to do that at that time, and What at any time does not do anything, that at that time is unable to do it) are affirmed (by us) to prove the existence of such power.
yadyadā yajjananāsamarthaṃ tattadā tanna karoti yathā śilāśakalamaṅku ram| asamarthaścāyaṃ vartamānārthakriyākaraṇakāletītānāgatayorarthakriyayoriti prasaṅgaḥ|	The negative rule is: What at any time is unable to produce anything, that at that time does not produce it, as a piece of stone, for example, does not produce a germ; and this entity (the seed, or whatever it may be), while exerting a present practical efficiency, is incapable of past and future practical efficiencies.
yadyadā yatkaroti tattadā tatra samarthaṃ yathā sāmagrī svakārye| karoti cāyamatītānāgatakāle tatkālavartinyāvatharkri ye bhāva iti prasaṅgavyatyayo viparyayaḥ|	The contradiction violating this rule is: What at any time does anything, that at that time is able to do that thing, as a complement of causes is able to produce its effect; and this (permanent) entity exerts at time past and time future the practical efficiencies proper to those times.
tasmādvipakṣe kramayaugapadyavyāvṛttyā vyāpakānupalambhenādhigatavyatirekavyāptikaṃ prasaṅgatadviparyaya- balādgṛhītānvayavyāptikaṃ ca sattvaṃ kṣaṇikatvapakṣa eva vyavasthāsyatīti siddham|	(To recapitulate.) Existence is restricted to the momentary; there being observed in regard to existence a negative rule, that in regard to permanent succession and simultaneity being excluded, existence which contains succession and simultaneity is not cognisable; and there being observed in regard to existence a positive rule, in virtue of a concomitance observed (viz., that the existent is accompanied or "pervaded" by the momentary), and in virtue of a non-concomitance observed (viz., that the non-momentary is accompanied or "pervaded" by the non-existent).
taduktaṃ jñānaśriyā- yatsattatkṣaṇikaṃ yathā jaladharaḥ santaśca bhāvā amī|	Therefore it has been said by Jñāna-śrī— "What is is momentary, as a cloud, and as these existent things;
sattā śaktirihārthakarmaṇi miteḥ siddheṣu siddhā na sā|	"The power of existence is relative to practical efficiency, and belongs to the ideal; but this power exists not as eternal in things eternal (ether, &c.);
nāpyekai va vidhānyathā parakṛtenāpi kriyādirbhaved dvedhāpi kṣaṇabhaṅgasaṃgatirataḥ sādhye ca viśrāmyati|	"Nor is there only one form, otherwise one thing could do the work of another; "For two reasons, therefore (viz., succession and simultaneity), a momentary flux is congruous and remains true in regard to that which we have to prove."

prayojakagauravāpatteḥ| anugatatvānanugatatvavikalpaparāhateśca|	Nor is the ascription of existence to universality, particularity, and co-inhesion dependent on any sui generis existence of their own; for such an hypothesis is operose, requiring too many sui generis existences.
sarṣapamahīdharādiṣu vilakṣaṇeṣu kṣaṇeṣvanugatasyākārasya maṇiṣu sūtravad bhūtagaṇeṣu guṇavaccāpratibhāsanācca|	Moreover, the existence of any universal is disproved by a dilemma regarding the presence or non-presence (of the one in the many); and there is not presented to us any one form running through all the diverse momentary things, mustard-seeds, mountains, and so forth, like the string running through the gems strung upon it.
kiṃ ca sāmānyaṃ sarvagataṃ svāśrayasarvagataṃ vā| prathame sarvavastusaṃkaraprasaṅgaḥ| apasiddhāntāpattiśca| yataḥ proktaṃ praśastapādena svaviṣayasarvagatamiti| kiṃ ca vidyamāne ghaṭe vartamānaṃ sāmānyamanyatra jāyamānena saṃbadhyamānaṃ tasmādāgacchatsaṃbadhyate anāgacchadvā|	Moreover (we would ask), is the universal omnipresent or present everywhere in its subjicible subjects? If it is everywhere, all things in the universe will be confounded together (chaos will be eternal), and you will be involved in a tenet you reject, since Praśasta-pāda has said, "Present in all its subjects." Again (if the universal is present only in its proper subjects), does the universal (the nature of a jar) residing in an already existing jar, on being attached to another jar now in making, come from the one to attach itself to the other, or not come from it? On the first alternative (if it comes), the universal must be a substance (for substances alone underlie qualities and motions); whereas, if it does not come, it cannot attach itself to the new jar.
dvitīye saṃbandhānupapattiḥ| kiṃ ca vinaṣṭe ghaṭe sāmānyamavatiṣṭhate vinaśyati sthānāntaraṃ gacchati vā| prathame nirādhāratvāpattiḥ| dvitīye nityatvavācoyuktyayuktiḥ| tṛtīye dravyatvaprasaktiḥ|	Again (we ask), when the jar ceases to exist, does the universal outlast it, or cease to exist, or go to another place? On the first supposition it will exist without a subject to inhere in; on the second, it will be improper to call it eternal (as you do); on the third, it will follow that it is a substance (or base of qualities and motions).
ityādidūṣaṇagraha - grastatvātsāmānyamaprāmāṇikam|	Destroyed as it is by the malign influence of these and the like objections, the universal is unauthenticated.
taduktam - anyatra vartamānasya tatonyasthānajanmani| tasmādacalataḥ sthānāddhṛttirityatiyuktatā||	Conformably it has been said— "Great is the dexterity of that which, existing in one place, engages without moving from that place in producing itself in another place.
yatrāsau vartate bhāvastena saṃbadhyate na tu| taddeśinaṃ ca vyāpnoti kimapyetanmahādbhutam||	"This entity (universality) is not connected with that wherein it resides, and yet pervades that which occupies that place: great is this miracle.
na yāti na ca tatrāsīdasti paścānna cāṃśavat| jahāti pūrvaṃ nādhāramaho vyasanasaṃtatiḥ||iti|	"It goes not away, nor was it there, nor is it subsequently divided, it quits not its former repository: what a series of difficulties!"
anuvṛttapratyayaḥ kimālambana iti cet- aṅga, anyāpohālambana eveti saṃtoṣṭavyamāyuṣmatetya- lamatiprasaṅgena|	If you ask: On what does the assurance that the one exists in the many rest? You must be satisfied with the reply that we concede it to repose on difference from that which is different (or exclusion of heterogeneity).
sarvasya saṃsārasya duḥkhātmakatvaṃ sarvatīrthakarasaṃmatam| anyathā tannivivṛtsūnāṃ teṣāṃ tannivṛttyupāye pravṛtyanupapatteḥ|	That all transmigratory existence is identical with pain is the common verdict of all the founders of institutes, else they would not be found desirous to put a stop to it and engaging in the method for bringing it to an end.
tasmātsarvaṃ duḥkhaṃ duḥkhamiti bhāvanīyam|	We must, therefore, bear in mind that all is pain, and pain alone.

tataḥ svalakṣaṇaṃ svalakṣaṇamiti bhāvanīyam|	We must therefore hold that all is like itself alone, like itself alone.
evaṃ śūnyaṃ śūnyamityapi bhāvanīyam|	In like manner we must hold that all is void, and void alone.

This silver or the like has not been seen by me in sleeping or waking. If what is seen were (really) existent, then reality would pertain to the corresponding act of vision, to the (nacre, &c.), which is the basis of its particular nature (or haecceity), to the silver, &c., illusorily superposed upon that basis, to the connection between them, to the co-inherence, and so forth: a supposition not entertained by any disputant.
na cārdhajaratīyamucitam|	Nor is a semi-effete existence admissible.
na hi ku ku ṭayāḥ ekobhāgaḥ pākāyāparo bhāgaḥ prasavāya kalpyatāmiti kalpyate|	No one imagines that one-half of a fowl may be set apart for cooking, and the other half for laying eggs.

atastattvaṃ sadasadubhayānubhayātmakacatuṣkoṭivinirmuktaṃ śūnyameva|	The ultimate principle, then, is a void emancipated from four alternatives, viz., from reality, from unreality, from both (reality and unreality), and from neither (reality nor unreality).
tathā hi| yadi ghaṭādeḥ sattvaṃ svabhāvastarhi kārakavyāpāravaiyarthyam|	To exemplify this: If real existence were the nature of a water-pot and the like, the activity of its maker (the potter) would be superfluous.
asattvaṃ svabhāva iti pakṣe prācīna eva doṣaḥ prāduḥṣyāt|	If non-existence be its nature the same objection will accrue; as it is said—
yathoktam - na mataḥ kāraṇāpekṣā vyomāderiva yujyate| kāryasyāsaṃbhavī hetuḥ khapuṣpāderivāsataḥ||	"Necessity of a cause befits not the existent, ether and the like, for instance; "No cause is efficacious of a non-existent effect, flowers of the sky and the like, for instance."
virodhāditarau pakṣāvanupannau|	The two remaining alternatives, as self-contradictory, are inadmissible.
taduktaṃ bhagavatā laṅkāvatāre - buddhayā viviccamānānāṃ svabhāvo nāvadhāryate|	It has accordingly been laid down by the venerated Buddha in the Alaṅkārāvatāra[6]— "Of things discriminated by intellect, no nature is ascertained;[7]
ato nirabhilapyāste niḥsvabhāvāśca darśitāḥ|	"Those things are therefore shown to be inexplicable and natureless."
iti ca|	And again—
na kvacidapi pakṣe vyavatiṣṭhata ityarthaḥ|	That is to say, the objects are not determined by any one of the four alternatives.
ata evoktam- parivrāṭkāmukaśunāmekasyāṃ pramadātanau|	Hence it is that it has been said—
ku ṇapaḥ kāminī bhakṣya iti tisro vikalpanāḥ||	"A religious mendicant, an amorous man, and a dog have three views of a woman's person, respectively that it is a carcass, that it is a mistress, and that it is a prey."

Accordingly we have overtaken our end, and there is nothing to be taught to us.
śiṣyaistāvadyogaścācāraśceti dvayaṃ karaṇīyam|	There consequently remain only two duties to the student—interrogation and acceptance.
tatrāprāptasyārthasya prāptaye paryanuyogo yogaḥ|	Of these, interrogation is the putting of questions in order to attain knowledge not yet attained.
gurūktasyārthasyāṅgīkaraṇamācāraḥ|	Acceptance is assent to the matters stated by the sacred teacher.
gurūktasyāṅgīkaraṇāduttamāḥ paryanuyogasyākaraṇādadhamāśca| atasteṣāṃ mādhyamikā iti prasiddhiḥ|	These (Bauddha nihilists) are excellent in assenting to that which the religious teacher enounces, and defective in interrogation, whence their conventional designation of Mādhyamikas (or mediocre).
gurūkta bhāvanācatuṣṭayaṃ bāhyārthasya śūnyatvaṃ cāṅgīkṛtyāntarasya śūnyatvaṃ cāṅgīkṛtaṃ kathamiti paryanuyogasya karaṇātke ṣāṃcidyogācāraprathā| eṣā hi teṣāṃ paribhāṣāsvayaṃvedanaṃ tāvadaṅgīkāryam| anyathā jagadāndhyaṃ prasajyeta|	Certain other Buddhists are styled Yogācāras, because while they accept the four points of view proclaimed by the spiritual guide, and the void of external things, they make the interrogation: Why has a void of the internal (or baselessness of mental phenomena) been admitted? For their technology is as follows:—Self-subsistent cognition must be allowed, or it will follow that the whole universe is blind.
tatkīrtitaṃ dharmakīrtināapratyakṣopalambhasya nārthadṛṣṭiḥ prasidhyati|	It has conformably been proclaimed by Dharmakīrti: "To one who disallows perception the vision of objects is not competent."
bāhyaṃ grāhyaṃ nopapadyata eva| vikalpānupapatteḥ|	An external percipibile is not admissible in consequence of the following dilemma.
arthoṃ jñānagrāhyo bhavannutpanno bhavati anutpanno vā| na pūrvaḥ| utpannasya sthityabhāvāt|	Does the object cognitively apprehensible arise from an entity or not? It does not result from an entity, for that which is generated has no permanence.
nāparaḥ| anutpannasyāsattvāt|	Nor is it non-resultant, for what has not come into being is non-existent.
atha manyethāḥ atīta evārthoṃ jñānagrāhyastajjanakatvāditi tadapi bālabhāṣitam| vartamānatāvabhāsavirodhāt| indriyāderapi jñānajanakatvena grāhyatvaprasaṅgācca|	Or (we may proceed) do you hold that a past object is cognitively apprehensible, as begetting cognition? If so, this is childish nonsense, because it conflicts with the apparent presentness of the object, and because on such a supposition the sense organs (and other imperceptible things) might be apprehended.
kiṃ ca grāhyaḥ kiṃ paramāṇurūporthoṃvayavirūpo vā| na caramaḥ| kṛtsnaikadeśavikalpādinā tannirākaraṇāt|	Further (we ask), Is the percipibile a simple atom or a complex body? The latter it cannot be, this alternative being ejected by the dilemma as to whether part or whole is perceived.
na prathamaḥ| atīndriyatvāt| ṣaṭke na yugapadyogasya bādhakatvācca| yathoktam- ṣaṭke na yugapadyogātparamāṇoḥ ṣaḍaṃśatā|	The former alternative is equally impossible, an atom being supersensible, and it not being able to combine simultaneously with six others; as it has been said— "If an atom could simultaneously combine with six, it would have six surfaces;
teṣāmapyekadeśatve piṇḍaḥ syādaṇumātrakaḥ|iti|	"And each of these being taken separately, there would be a body of atomic dimension."
tasmātsvavyatiriktagrāhyavirahāttadātmikā buddhiḥ svayameva svātmarūpaprakāśikā prakāśavaditi siddham|	Intellect, therefore, as having no other percipibile but itself, is shown to be itself its own percipibile, self-subsistent, luminous with its own light, like light. Therefore it has been said—
taduktam - nānyonubhāvyo buddhayāsti tasyā nānubhavo'paraḥ|	"There is naught to be objectified by intellect; there is no cognition ulterior thereto;
grāhyagrāhakavaidhuryātsvayaṃ saiva prakāśate|| grāhyagrāhakayorabhedaścānumātavyaḥ| yadvedyate yena vedanena tattato na bhidyate yathā jñānenātmā|	The identity of percipient and percept is inferrible, thus: That which is cognised by any cognition is not other than that cognition, as soul, for instance, is not other than the cognition of soul; and blue and other momentary objects are cognised by cognitions.
bhede hi satyadhunānenārthasya saṃbandhitvaṃ na syāt| tādātmyasya niyamahetorabhāvāt| tadutpatteraniyāmakatvāt|	For if there were a difference (between percept and percipient), the object could not now have any connection with the cognition, there being no identity to determine a constancy of connection, and nothing to determine the rise of such a connection.
yaścāyaṃ grāhyāgrāhakasaṃvittīnāṃ pṛthagavabhāsaḥ sa ekasmiṃścandramasi dvitvāvabhāsa iva bhramaḥ|	As for the appearance of an interval between the object and subject consciousnesses, this is an illusion, like the appearance of two moons when there is only one.
atrāpyanādiravicchinnapravāhābhedavāsanaiva nimittam| yathoktam - sahopalambhaniyamādabhedo nīlataddhiyoḥ|	The cause of this illusion is ideation of difference in a stream without beginning and without interruption; as it has been said—
bhedaśca bhrāntivijñānairddaśyetendāvivādvaye|| avibhāgopi buddhayātmā viparyāsitadarśanaiḥ| grāhyagrāhakasaṃvittibhedāvāniva lakṣyate||	"As invariably cognised together, the blue object and the cognition thereof are identical; "And the difference should be accounted for by illusory cognitions, as in the example of the single moon."
iti ca|	And again—
na ca rasavīryavipākādisamānamāśāmodakopārjitamodakānāṃ syāditi veditavyam| vastuto vedyavedakākāravidhurāyā api buddhervyavahartṛparijñānānurodhena vibhinnagrāhyagrāhakākārarūpavattayā timirādyupahatākṣṇāṃ ke śoḍuṇkanāḍījñānabhedavadanādyupalpavavāsanāsāmarthyāvyavasthopapatteḥ paryanuyogā- yogāt yathoktam - avedyavedakākārā yathā bhrāntaurnirīkṣyate|	Nor must it be supposed that (on this hypothesis) the juice, the energy, and the digestion derivable from an imaginary and an actual sweetmeat will be the same; for it cannot be questioned that though the intellect be in strictness exempt from the modes of object and subject, yet there is competent to it a practical distinction in virtue of the succession of illusory ideas without beginning, by reason of its possessing diverse modes percept and percipient, conformably to its illusory supposition of practical agency, just as to those whose eyes are dim with some morbid affection a hair and another minute object may appear either diverse or identical; as it has been said—
vibhaktalakṣaṇagrāhyagrāhakākāraviplavā||	"Illuded with the diverse forms of perception, percept and percipient;
tathā kṛtavyavastheyaṃ ke śādijñānabhedavat|	"So when the intellect has posited a diversity, as in the example of the differences of the cognition of a hair and the like,
yadā tadā na saṃcodyā grāhyagrāhakalakṣaṇā||iti||	"Then it is not to be doubted that it is characterised as percipient and percept."
tasmād buddhirevānādivāsanāvaśādanekākārāvabhāsata iti siddham|	Thus it has been evinced that intellect, as affected by beginningless ideation, manifests itself under diverse forms.
tataśca prāguktabhāva- nāpracayabalānnikhilavāsanocche davigalitavividhaviṣayākāropalpavaviśuddhavijñānodayohodaya iti|	When, therefore, by constancy of reflection (on the four points of view) aforesaid, all ideation has been interrupted, there arises knowledge purged from the illusions which take the form of objects, such illusions being now melted away; and this is technically called Mahodaya (the grand exaltation, emancipation).
anye tu manyante| yathoktaṃ bāhyaṃ vastujātaṃ nāstīti tadayuktam pramāṇābhāvāt|	Others again (the Sautrāntikas) hold that the position that there is no external world is untenable, as wanting evidence.

If you rejoin (they proceed): Let there be a proof of this identity, and let this proof be invariability of simultaneous cognition,—we refuse this, because inasmuch as cognition must ultimately have some object, it is manifested in duality, and because such invariability of simultaneity as to time and place is impossible.
ekadeśatvaikakālatva- lakṣaṇasahatvaniyamāsaṃbhavācca| kiṃ ca nīlādyarthasya jñānākāratvehamiti pratibhāsaḥ syāt|	Moreover (they continue), if the object, blue or whatever it be, were only a form of cognition, it should be presented as Ego, not as Hoc aliquid, because the cognition and the object would be identical.

jñānasyābhedino bhedapratibhāsopyupaplavaḥ|| yadantarjñeyatattvaṃ tadvahirvadavabhāsate|	"This side of knowledge which appears external to the other portion, "This appearance of duality in the unity of cognition is an illusion."
iti ca||	And again—
tadayuktam| bāhyārthābhāve tadvayutpattirahitatayā bahirvatadityupamānokte rayukteḥ|	To this we reply (say the Sautrāntikas): This is untenable, for if there be no external objects, there being no genesis of such, the comparison "as if they were external" is illegitimate.
na hi vasumitro vandhyāputravadavabhāsata iti prekṣāvānācakṣīta| bhedapratibhāsasya bhrāntatve'bhedapratibhāsya prāmāṇyaṃ tatpramāṇye ca bhedapratibhāsasya bhrāntatvamiti parasparāśrayaprasaṅgācca|	No man in his senses would say, "Vasumitra looks like the son of a childless mother." Again, if the manifestation of identity be proved by the illusoriness of the presentment of duality, and the presentment of duality be proved illusory by the manifestation of identity, you are involved in a logical circle.
avisaṃvādānnīlatādikameva saṃvidānā bāhyamevopādadate jagatyupekṣante cāntaramiti vyavasthādarśanācca|	Without controversy we observe that cognitions take external things, blue or whatever they may be, as their objects, and do not take merely internal modifications as such, and we see that men in their everyday life overlook their internal states.
evaṃ cāyamabhedasādhako hetu rgoṃmayapāyasīyanyāyavadābhāsatāṃ bhajet|	Thus this argument which you adduce to prove that there is difference between subject and object, turns out a mere absurdity, like milky food made of cow-dung.
ato bahirvaditi vadatā bāhyaṃ grāhyameveti bhāvanīyamiti bhavadīya eva bāṇo bhavantaṃ praharet|	When then you say "as if it were external," you must already suppose an external percipibile, and your own arrow will return upon you and wound you.

ata eva paryanuyogaparihārau samagrāhiṣātām - bhinnakālaṃ kathaṃ grāhyamiti cendrāhyatāṃ viduḥ |	The interrogation and response on this point have been thus summarised— "If it be asked, How can there be a past percipibile? They recognise perceptibility,
hetutvameva ca vyakte rjñānākārārpaṇakṣamam||	"And a competent inferribility of the individual thing is its imposition of its form."
tathā ca yathā puṣṭayā bhojanamanumīyate yathā ca bhāṣayā deśaḥ yathā vā saṃbhrameṇa snehaḥ tathā jñānākāreṇa jñeyamanumeyam|	As nourishment is inferred from a thriving look, as nationality is inferred from language, and as affection is inferred from flurried movements, so from the form of knowledge a knowable may be inferred.
taduktam - arthena ghaṭayatyenāṃ na hi muktvārtharūpatām|	Therefore it has been said— "With half (of itself) the object moulds (the cognition) without losing the nature of a half;
tasmātprameyādhigateḥ pramāṇaṃ meyarūpatā||iti|	"The evidence, therefore, of the recognition of a knowable is the nature of the knowable."
na hi vittisattaiva tadvedanā yuktā| tasyāḥ sarvatrāviśeṣāt| tāṃ tu sārūpyamāviśatsarūpayituṃ ghaṭayediti ca|	For consciousness of the cognition cannot be the being of the cognition, for this consciousness is everywhere alike, and if indifference were to attach itself to this, it would reduce all things to indifference.

nīlādyullekhi ca vijñānaṃ pravṛttivijñānam|	Of these, the recognition of a subject is the presentation of the Ego, the manifestation as blue and so forth is a presentment of activity, as it has been said—
yathoktam - tatsyādālayavijñānaṃ yadbhavedahamāspadam|	"That is a recognition of a subject which is conversant about the Ego:
tatsyātpravṛttivijñānaṃ yannīlādikamullikheta||iti|	"That is a presentment of activity which manifests blue and the rest."

vijñānavādinaye hi vāsanā nāmaikasaṃtānavartināmālayavijñānānāṃ tattatpravṛttivijñānajananaśaktiḥ|	According to the view of the Sensationalists (vijñānavādin), ideation is a power of generating such and such sensations (or presentments of activity) in subject-recognitions which exist as a single stream.
tasyāśca svakāryoṃtpādaṃ pratyābhimukhyaṃ paripākaḥ| tasya ca pratyayaḥ kāraṇaṃ svasaṃtānavartipūrvakṣaṇaḥ kakṣīkriyate| saṃtānāntaranibandhanatvānaṅgīkārāt|	The maturescence of this power is its readiness to produce its effect; of this the result is a presentment (or sensation); the antecedent momentary object (sensation) in the mental train is accepted as the cause, no other mental train being admitted to exercise such causality.
tataśca pravṛttivijñānajanakālayavijñāna- vartivāsanāparipākaṃ prati sarvepyālayavijñānavartinaḥ kṣaṇāḥ samarthā eveti vaktavyam|	It must therefore be stated that all momentary objects (fleeting sensations) in the subject-consciousness are alike able to bring about that maturescence of ideation in the subject-consciousness, which maturescence is productive of presentments of activity.
na cedekopi na samarthaḥ syāt|	If any one (of these fleeting sensations) had not this power, none would possess it, all existing alike in the stream of subject-recognitions.

te catvāraḥ pratyayāḥ prasiddhā ālambanasamanantarasahakāryadhipatirūpāḥ|	These four conditions are known as (1.) the data, (2.) the suggestion, (3.) the medium, and (4.) the dominant (organ).
tatra jñānapadavedanīyasya nīlādyavabhāsasya cittasya nīlādālambanapratyayānnīlākāratā bhavati| samanantarapratyayātprācīna- jñānādvodharūpatā|	Of these, the form of blue or the like arises from the condition of blue data in the understanding in which there is a manifestation of blue or the like, which manifestation is styled a cognition.
sahakāripratyayādālokātspaṣṭatā|	The resuscitation of forms or cognitions arises from suggestion as a condition.
cakṣuṣodhipatipratyayādviṣayagrahaṇāpratiniyamaḥ|	The restriction to the apprehension of this or that object arises from the medium, light, for instance, as a condition, and from the dominant, the eye, for example, as another condition.
uditasya jñānasya rasādisādhāraṇyeprāpte niyāmakaṃ cakṣuradhipatirbhavitumarhati| loke niyāmakasyādhipattitvopalambhāt|	The eye, as determinant of one particular cognition (form) where taste, &c., might have been equally cognised, is able to become dominant; for in everyday life he who determines is regarded as dominant.
evaṃ cittacaittātmakānāṃ sukhādīnāṃ catvāri kāraṇāni draṣṭavyāni|	We must thus recognise four causes of pleasure and the rest which constitute the understanding and its modifications.
soyaṃ cittacaittātmakaḥ skandha pañcavidho rūpavijñānavedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskārasaṃjñakaḥ|	So also the universe, which consists of mind and its modifications, is of five kinds, entitled (1.) the sensational, (2.) the perceptional, (3.) the affectional, (4.) the verbal, and (5.) the impressional.
tatra rūpyanta ebhirviṣayā iti rūpayanta iti ca vyutpatyā saviṣayāṇīndriyāṇi rūpaskandhaḥ|	Of these, the sensible world (rūpa-skandha) is the sense organs and their objects, according to the etymology, viz., that objects are discriminated (rūpyante) by these.
ālayavijñāna- pravṛttivijñānapravāho vijñānaskandhaḥ|	The perceptional world is the stream of subject-recognitions and of presentments of activity.
prāguktaskandhadvayasaṃbandhajanyaḥ sukhaduḥkhādipratyayapravāho vedanāskandhaḥ gaurityādiśabdollekhisaṃvitpravāhaḥ saṃjñāskandhaḥ|	The affectional world is the stream of feelings of pleasure and pain generated by the two aforesaid worlds. The verbal (or symbolical) world is the stream of cognitions conversant about words—the words "cow," and so forth.
vedanāskandhanibandhanā rāgadveṣādayaḥ kleśā upakleśāśca madamānādayo dharmādharmoṃ ca saṃskāraskandhaḥ|	The impressional world is the miseries, as desire, aversion, &c., caused by the affectional world, the lesser miseries, as conceit, pride, &c., and merit and demerit.
tadidaṃ sarvaṃ dukhaṃ duḥkhāyatanaṃ duḥkhasādhanaṃ ceti bhāvayitvā tannirodhopāyaṃ tattvajñānaṃ saṃpādayet|	Reflecting, therefore, that this universe is pain, an abode of pain, and an instrument of pain, a man should acquire a knowledge of the principles, the method of suppressing this pain.
ata evoktaṃ duḥkhasamudāyanirodhamārgāścatvāra āryabuddhasyābhimatāni tattvāni|	Hence it has been said— "The principles sanctioned by Buddha are to the saint the four methods of suppressing the aggregate of pain."[8]
tatra duḥkhaṃ prasiddham| samudāyo duḥkhakāraṇam|	In these words the sense of pain is known to every one; the "aggregate" means the cause of pain.
tad dvividhaṃ pratyayopanibandhano hetūpanibandhanaśca|	This aggregate is twofold, as (1.) determined by concurrence; or (2.) determined by causation.
tatra pratyayopanibandhanasya saṃgrāhakaṃ sūtram - idaṃ pratyayaphalam' iti idaṃ kāryaṃ ye anye hetavaḥ pratyayanti gacchanti teṣāmayamānānāṃ hetūnāṃ bhāvaḥ pratyayatvaṃ kāraṇasamavāyaḥ, tanmātrasya phalaṃ na cetanasya kasyaciditi sūtrārthaḥ|	Of these, there is an aphorism comprising the aggregate determined by concurrence, "which other causes resort to this effect;" the condition of these causes thus proceeding is concurrence; the concurrence of causes is the result of this only, and not of any conscious being,—such is the meaning of the aphorism.
yathā bījaheturaṅku ro dhātūnāṃ ṣaṣṇāṃ samavāyājjāyate|	To exemplify this. A germ, caused by a seed, is generated by the concurrence of six elements.
tatra pṛthivīdhāturaṅku rasya kāṭhinyaṃ gandhaṃ ca janayati| abdhātuḥ snehaṃ rasaṃ ca janayati| tejodhātū rūpamauṣṇyaṃ ca| vāyudhātuḥ sparśanaṃ calanaṃ ca| ākāśadhāturavakāśaṃ śabdaṃ ca|	Of these, earth as an element produces hardness and smell in the germ; water as an element produces viscidity and moisture; light as an element produces colour and warmth; air as an element produces touch and motion; ether as an element produces expansion and sound; the season as an element produces a fitting soil, &c.

yasminsati yadutpadyate yasminnasati yannotpadyate tattasya kāraṇasya kāryamiti| dharmatetyasya vivaraṇaṃ dharma sthititetyādi|	That which comes into being, provided that something exists, is the effect of that as its cause; such is the explanation of the nature (or causal relation).
dharmasya kāryasya kāraṇānatikrameṇa sthitiḥ|	Continuance as a condition is where the effect is not found without its cause.
svārthikastalapratyayaḥ|	The (abstract) affix tal (in the word sthititā) has the sense of the concrete.
dharmasya kāraṇasya kāryaṃ prati niyāmakatā|	Determination by a condition is the determination of the effect by the cause.
nanvayaṃ kāryakāraṇabhāvaścetanamantareṇa na saṃbhavatītyata uktaṃ pratītyeti|	Here some one might interpose the remark that the relation of cause and effect cannot exist apart from some conscious agent.

na cātra bāhye samudāye kāraṇaṃ bījādi kāryamaṅku rādi vā cetayate ahamaṅku raṃ nirvartayāmi ahaṃ bījena nirvatita iti|	In this external aggregate neither the cause, the seed and the rest, nor the effect, the germ and the rest, has any consciousness of bringing a germ into being, or of being brought into being by the seed.
evamādhyātmike ṣvapi kāraṇadvayamavagantavyam|	In like manner in mental facts two causes are to be recognised.
puraḥ sthite prameyābdhau granthavistarabhīrubhiḥ|	There is a whole ocean of scientific matter before us, but we desist, apprehensive of making our treatise unduly prolix.
iti nyāyenoparamyate| tadubhayanirodhaḥ tadanantaraṃ vimalajñānodayo vā muktiḥ|	Emancipation is the suppression of these two causal aggregates, or the rise of pure cognition subsequent to such suppression.
tannirodhopāyo mārgaḥ|	The method (path, road) is the mode of suppressing them.
sa ca tattvajñānam| tacca prācīnabhāvanābalādbhavatīti paramaṃ rahasyam|	And this method is the knowledge of the principles, and this knowledge accrues from former ideas. Such is the highest mystery.
sūtrasyāntaṃ pṛcchatāṃ kathitaṃ bhavantaśca sūtrasyāntaṃ pṛṣṭavantaḥ sautrāntikā bhavantviti| bhagavatābhihitatayā sautrāntikasaṃjñā saṃjāteti|	The name Sautrāntika arose from the fact that the venerated Buddha said to certain of his disciples who asked what was the ultimate purport (anta) of the aphorism (sūtra), "As you have inquired the final purport of the aphorism, be Sautrāntikas."

These the venerated Buddha styled Prāthamika (primary) disciples. A second school, attached to the apprehension of sensations only, maintain that sensation is the only reality. A third school, who contend that both are true (the internal and the external), and maintain that sensible objects are inferrible.
eṣā hi teṣāṃ paribhāṣā samunmiṣati|	Others hold all this to be absurd language (viruddhā bhāshā), and are known under the designation of Vaibhāshikas.
vijñeyānumeyatvavāde prātyakṣikasya kasyacidapyarthasyābhāvena vyāptisaṃvedanasthānābhāvenānumānapravṛttyanupapattiḥ sakala- lokānubhavavirodhaśca|	Their technical language springs up as follows:—According to the doctrine of inferrible sensibles, there being no perceptible object, and consequently no object from which a universal rule can be attained, it will be impossible that any illation should take place, and therefore a contradiction will emerge to the consciousness of all mankind.
tataścārthoṃ dvividhaḥ- grāhyodhyavaseyaśca|	Objects, therefore, are of two kinds, sensible and cogitable.
tatra grahaṇaṃ nirvikalpakarūpaṃ pramāṇam| kalpanāpoḍhatvāt| adhyavasāyaḥ savikalpakarūpo'pramāṇam| kalpanājñānatvāt|	Of these apprehension is a non-discriminative instrument of knowledge as other than mere representation; cognition which is discriminative is not a form of evidence, as being a merely ideal cognition.
taduktam - kalpanāpoḍhamabhrāntaṃ pratyakṣaṃ nirvikalpakam|	Therefore it has been said— "Apprehension, exempt from ideality and not illusory, is non-discriminative.
vikalpo vastunirbhāsādasaṃvādādupalpavaḥ||iti|	Discrimination, as resulting from the appearances of things, is without controversy an illusion.
grāhyaṃ vastu pramāṇaṃ hi grahaṇaṃ yaditonyathā|	"The perceptible evidence of things is perception: if it were aught else,

Let it be replied: This question does not concern us, for these may be accounted for by the possibility of an indirect apprehension of objects, just as if we suppose the light of a gem to be a gem (we may yet handle the gem, because it underlies the light, while if we were to take nacre for silver, we could not lay hold of any silver).

It should not be contended that a diversity of instruction according to the disciples' modes of thought is not traditional (or orthodox); for it is said in the gloss on the Bodha-citta—
bhidyante bahudhā loka upāyairbahubhiḥ punaḥ|	"Are said to be diverse in many ways, according to a plurality of methods.

dvādaśāyatanapūjā śreyaskarīti bauddhanaye prasiddham - arthānupārjya bahuśo dvādaśāyatanāni vai|	It is well known in Buddhist doctrine that the worship of the twelve inner seats (āyatana) is conducive to felicity. "After acquiring wealth in abundance, the twelve inner seats

taditthaṃ muktakacchānāṃ matamasahamānā vivasanāḥ kathaṃcitsthāyitvamāsthāya kṣaṇikatvapakṣaṃ pratikṣipanti|	The Gymnosophists[1] (Jainas), rejecting these opinions of the Muktakacchas,[2] and maintaining continued existence to a certain extent, overthrow the doctrine of the momentariness of everything.
yadyātmā kaścinnāsthīyeta sthāyī tadaihalaukikapāralaukikaphalasādhanasaṃpādanaṃ viphalaṃ bhavet|	(They say): If no continuing soul is accepted, then even the arrangement of the means for attaining worldly fruit in this life will be useless.

Therefore as this conviction, "I who previously did the deed, am the person who now reap its consequences," establishes undoubtedly the existence of a continuing soul, which remains constant through the previous and the subsequent period, the discriminating Jaina Arhats reject as untenable the doctrine of momentary existence, i.e., an existence which lasts only an instant, and has no previous or subsequent part.

In this way, since our tenet has been demonstrated by the argument, 'whatever is, is momentary, &c.,' it follows that in each parallel line of successive experiences the previous consciousness is the agent and the subsequent one reaps the fruit.
na cātiprasaṅgaḥ| kāryakāraṇabhāvasya niyāmakatvāt|	Nor may you object that, 'if this were true, effects might extend beyond all bounds'—[i.e., A might act, and B receive the punishment]—because there is an essentially controlling relation in the very nature of cause and effect.

yathoktam - yasminneva hi saṃtāne āhitā karmavāsanā|	As it has been said— "'In whatever series of successive states the original impression of the action was produced,

nādyaḥ|	[supra, p.
bhavadabhimatasya kṣaṇikatvasya kvacidapyadṛṣṭacaratvena dṛṣṭāntasiddhāvasyānumānasyānutthānāt|	15], was your favourite "momentariness" proved by this very proof or by some other? It could not be the former, because your alleged momentariness is not always directly visible in the cloud, and consequently, as your example is not an ascertained fact, your supposed inference falls to the ground.
na dvitīyaḥ| tenaiva nyāyena sarvatra kṣaṇikatvasiddhau satvānumānavaiphalyāpatteḥ|	Nor can it be the latter—because you might always prove your doctrine of momentariness by this new proof (if you had it), and consequently your argument regarding all existence ["whatever is, is momentary," &c.] would become needless.
arthakriyākāritvaṃ sattvamityaṅgīkāre mithyāsarpadaṃśāderapyartha- kriyākāritvena sattvāpātācca|	If you take as your definition of "existence" "that which produces an effect," this will not hold, as it would include even the bite of a snake imagined in the rope, since this undoubtedly produces the effect [of fear].
ata evoktam- utpādavyayaghrauvyayuktaṃ saditi| athocyate sāmarthyāsāmārthyalakṣaṇaviruddhadharmādhyāsāttatsiddhiriti tadasādhu|	Hence it has been said that the definition of an existence is "that which possesses an origin, an end, and an [intermediate] duration."

na ca kāryakāraṇabhāvaniyametiprasaṅgaṃ bhaṅktu marhati|	Nor is our objection obviated by your supposed definite relation between causes and effects.

(vī.stu.18) iti|	This has been said by the author of the Siddhasenāvākya—
kiṃ ca kṣaṇikatvapakṣe jñānakāle jñeyasyāsatvena jñeyakāle jñānasyāsattvena ca grāhyagrāhaka- bhāvānupapattau sakalalokayātrāstamiyāt|	"The loss of the thing done,—the enjoyment of the fruit of a thing not done,—the dissolution of all existence,—and the abolition of memory,—bold indeed is the Buddhist antagonist, when, in the teeth of these four objections, he seeks to establish his doctrine of momentary destruction!"
na ca samasamayavartitā śaṅkanīyā| savyetaraviṣāṇa- vatkāryakāraṇabhāvāsaṃbhavenāgrāhyasyālambanapratyayatvānupapatteḥ|	Nor may you suppose that the object and the perception are simultaneous, because this would imply that, like the two horns of an animal, they did not stand in the relation of cause and effect [as this relation necessarily involves succession], and consequently the Ālambana, or the object's data [supra, p.
atha bhinnakālasyāpi tasyākāra- rpakatvena grāhyatvam- tadapyapeśalam|	If you say that "the object may still be perceived, inasmuch as it will impress its form on the perception, even though the one may have existed in a different moment from the other," this too will not hold.
kṣaṇikasya jñānasyākārārpakatāśrayatāyā durvacatvena sākārajñānavādapratyādeśāt| nirākārajñānavādepi yogyatāvaśena pratikarmavyavasthāyāḥ sthitatvāt|	For if you maintain that the knowledge acquired by perception has a certain form impressed upon it, you are met by the impossibility of explaining how a momentary perception can possess the power of impressing a form; and if you say that it has no form impressed upon it, you are equally met by the fact that, if we are to avoid incongruity, there must be some definite condition to determine the perception and knowledge in each several case.
tathā hi pratyakṣeṇa viṣayākārarahitameva jñānaṃ pratipuruṣamahamahamikayāghaṭādigrāhakamanubhūyate na tu darpaṇādivatpratibimbākrāntam| viṣayākāradhāritatve ca jñānasyārthe dūranikaṭādivyavahārāya jalāñjalirvitīryeta|	Thus by perception the abstract consciousness, which before existed uninfluenced by the external object, becomes modified under the form of a jar, &c., with a definite reference to each man's personality [i.e., I see the jar], and it is not merely the passive recipient of a reflection like a mirror.
na cedamiṣṭāpādanameṣṭavyam| davīyānmahīdharo nedīyāndīrghoṃ bāhuriti vyavahārasya nirābādhaṃ jāgarukatvāt| na cākārādhāyakasya tasya davīyastvādiśālitayā tathā vyavahāra iti kathanīyam| darpaṇādau tathānupalambhāt| kiṃ cārthādupajāyamānaṃ jñānaṃ yathā tasya nīlākāratāmanukaroti tathā yadi jaḍatāmapi tarhyarthattadapi jaḍaṃ syāt|	Moreover, if the perception only reproduced the form of the object, there would be an end of using such words as "far," "near," &c., of the objects.[5] Nor can you accept this conclusion, "as exactly in accordance with your own views," because, in spite of all our logic, the stubborn fact remains that we do use such phrases as "the mountain is nearer" or "further," "long" or "large." Nor may you say that "it is the object (which supplies the form) that really possesses these qualities of being 'further,' &c., and they are applied by a fashion of speech to the perception [though not really belonging to it]"—because we do not find that this is the case in a mirror [i.e., it does not become a far reflection because it represents a far object.] And again, as the perception produced by an object follows it in assuming the form of blue, so too, if the object be insentient, it ought equally to assume its form and so become itself insentient.
tathā ca vṛddhimiṣṭavato mūlamapi te naṣṭaṃ syāditi mahatkaṣṭamāpannam|	And thus, according to the proverb, "wishing to grow, you have destroyed your root," and your cause has fallen into hopeless difficulties.
athaitaddoṣaparijihīrṣayā jñānaṃ jaḍatāṃ nānukarotīti brūṣe hanta tarhi tasyā grahaṇaṃ na syādityekāmanusaṃdhitsatoparaṃ pracyayata iti nyāyāpātaḥ| nanu mā bhūjjaḍatāyā grahaṇam|	If, in your wish to escape this difficulty, you assert that "the perception does not follow the object in being insentient," then there would be no perception that the object is insentient,[6] and so it is a case of the proverb, "While he looks for one thing which he has lost, another drops." "But what harm will it be if there is no perception of a thing's being insentient?" [We reply], that if its being insentient is not perceived, while its blue form is perceived, the two may be quite distinct [and as different from each other as a jar and cloth], or it may be a case of "indeterminateness" [so that the two may be only occasionally found together, as smoke with fire].
kiṃ naśchinnam| tadagrahaṇepi nīlākāragrahaṇe tayo rbhedonekānto vā bhavet| nīlākāragrahaṇe cāgṛhītājaḍatā kathaṃ tasya svarūpaṃ syāt| aparathā gṛhītasya stambhasyāgṛhītaṃ trailokyamapi rūpaṃ bhavet|	And again, if insentience is not perceived contemporaneously with the blue form, how could there then be conformity between them [so that both the blue and the insentience should together constitute the character of the thing?] We might just as well maintain that, on perceiving a post, the unperceived universe entered into it as also constituting its character.[7]
tadetatprameyajātaṃ prabhācandraprabhṛtibhirarhanmatānusāribhiḥ prameyakamalamārtaṇḍādau (pra.ka.mā.pṛ.27) prabandhe prapañcitamiti granthabhūyastvabhayānnopanyastam|	All this collection of topics for proof has been discussed at full length by the Jaina authors, Pratāpacandra and others, in the Prameyakamalamārtaṇḍa, &c., and is here omitted for fear of swelling the book too much.
tasmātpuruṣārthābhilāṣukaiḥ puruṣaiḥ saugatī gatirnānugantavyā| api tvārhatyevārhaṇīyā|	Therefore those who wish for the summum bonum of man must not accept the doctrine of Buddha, but rather honour only the Ārhata doctrine.
arhatsvarūpaṃ ca hemacandrasūribhirāptaniścāyālaṃkāre niraṭaṅki|	The Arhat's nature has been thus described by Arhachcandra-sūri,[8] in his Āptaniścayālaṅkāra.
sarvajño jitarāgādidoṣastrailokyapūjitaḥ| yathāsthitārthavādī ca devorhanparameśvaraḥ||iti|	"The divine Arhat is the supreme lord, the omniscient one, who has overcome all faults, desire, &c.,—adored by the three worlds, the declarer of things as they are."
nanu na kaścitpuruṣaviśeṣaḥ sarvajñapadavedanīyaḥ pramāṇapaddhatimadhyāste| tatsadbhāvagrāhakasya pramāṇapañcakasya tatrānupalambhāt|	But may it not be objected that no such omniscient soul can enter the path of proof, since none of the five affirmative proofs can be found to apply, as has been declared by Tautātita [Bhaṭṭa Kumārila[9]]?
dṛṣṭo na caikadeśosti liṅgaṃ vā yonumāpayet|| na cāgamavidhiḥ kaścinnitya sarvajñabodhakaḥ|	"No omniscient being is seen by the sense here in this world by ourselves or others; nor is there any part of him seen which might help us as a sign to infer his existence.

sarvajñasadṛśaṃ kaṃ cidyadi paśyema saṃprati| upamānena sarvajñaṃ jānīyāma tato vayam||	"And again, if we now could see anything like an omniscient being, we might have a chance of recognising him by the [well-known fourth] proof, comparison (upamāna).

yadyagdrahaṇasvabhāvatve sati prakṣīṇa- pratibandhapratyayaṃ tattatsākṣātkāri yathāpagatatimirādipratibandhaṃ locanavijñānaṃ rūpasākṣātkāri|	Whatever thing has a natural capacity for knowing any object, will, when its hindrances to such knowledge are done away, actually know it, just as the sense of vision cognises form, directly the hindrances of darkness, &c., are removed.

Nor is the assertion unestablished that the soul has a natural capacity for grasping all things; for otherwise the Mīmāṃsist could not maintain that a knowledge of all possible cases can be produced by the authoritative injunction of a text,[12]—nor could there otherwise be the knowledge of universal propositions, such as that in our favourite argument, "All things are indeterminate from the very fact of their existence" [and, of course, a follower of the Nyāya will grant that universal propositions can be known, though he will dispute the truth of this particular one].

Nor can you say that "it is impossible to destroy the obstructions which hinder the soul's knowing all things," because we [Jainas] are convinced that there are certain special means to destroy these obstructions, viz., the three ["gems"], right intuition, &c.
anayā mudrayāpi kṣudropadravā vidrāvyāḥ|	By this charm also, all inferior assaults of argument can be put to flight.

We reply that there is no proof of your eternally liberated being.
na sarvajñonādimuktaḥ| muktatvādiramuktavat| vaddhāpekṣayā ca muktavyapadeśaḥ|	There cannot be an omniscient who is eternally "liberated," from the very fact of his being "liberated," like other liberated persons,—since the use of the term "liberated" necessarily implies the having been previously bound; and if the latter is absent, the former must be too, as is seen in the case of the ether.
tadrahite cāsyāpyabhāvaḥ syādākāśavat| nanvanādeḥ kṣityādikāryaparaṃparāyāḥ kartṛtvena tatsiddhiḥ| tathā hi- kṣityādikaṃ sakartṛkaṃ kāryatvāddhaṭavaditi|	"But is not this being's existence definitely proved by his being the maker of that eternal series of effects, the earth, &c.? according to the well-known argument, 'the earth, &c., must have had a maker, because they have the nature of effects, as a jar.'" This argument, however, will not hold, because you cannot prove that they have the nature of effects.
na ca sāvayavatvena tatsādhanamityabhidhātavyam| yasmādidaṃ vikalpajālamavatarati|	You cannot establish this from the fact of their being composed of parts, because this supposition falls upon the horns of a dilemma.
sāvayavatvaṃ kimavayavasaṃyogitvam avayavasamavāyitvam avayavajanyatvaṃ samavetadravyatvaṃ sāvayavabuddhiviṣayatvaṃ vā|	Does this "being composed of parts" mean (i.) the being in contact with the parts; or (ii.) "the being in intimate relation to the parts; or (iii.) the being produced from parts;" or (iv.) the being a substance in intimate relation; or (v.) the being the object of an idea involving the notion of parts?
na prathamaḥ| ākāśādāvanaikāntyāt| na dvitīyaḥ| sāmānyādau vyabhicārāt| na tṛtīyaḥ|	Not the first, because it would apply too widely, as it would include ether [since this, though not itself composed of parts, is in contact with the parts of other things;] nor the second, because it would similarly include genus, &c.

If you say the former, it will equally apply to ether, since this is a substance, and has its qualities resident in it by intimate relation; if you say the latter, your new position involves as much dispute as the original point, since you would have to prove the existence of intimate relation in the parts, or the so-called "intimate causes," which you mean by "something else." We use these terms in compliance with your terminology; but, of course, from our point of view, we do not allow such a thing as "intimate relation," as there is no proof of its existence.

(vī.stu. 6) iti|	And again—

na cānyonyāśrayādidoṣaḥ| āgamasarvajñaparaṃparāyā bījāṅku ravadanāditvāṅgīkārādityalam|	Nor is our doctrine liable to the imputation of such faults as Anyonyāśrayatā,[15] &c., because we accept an eternal succession of revealed doctrines and omniscient teachers, like the endless series of seed springing from shoot and shoot from seed.

This has been thus explained by Yogadeva:—
yena rūpeṇa jīvādyarthoṃ vyavasthitastena rūpeṇārhatā pratipādite tattvārthe viparītābhiniveśarahitatvādyaparaparyāyaṃ śraddhānaṃ samyagdarśanam| tattvārthasūtraṃ- tatvārthaṃ śraddhānaṃ samyagdarśanamiti| anyadapi- rucirjinoktatattveṣu samyak śraddhānamucyate| jāyate tannisargeṇa guroradhigamena vā||iti|| paropadeśanirapekṣamātmasvarūpaṃ nisargaḥ|	(a.) When the meaning of the predicaments, the soul, &c., has been declared by an Arhat in exact accordance with their reality, absolute faith in the teaching, i.e., the entire absence of any contrary idea, is "right intuition." And to this effect runs the Tattvārtha-sūtra, "Faith in the predicaments[16] is right 'intuition.'" Or, as another definition gives it, "Acquiescence in the predicaments declared by a Jina is called 'right faith;' it is produced either by natural character or by the guru's instruction." "Natural character" means the soul's own nature, independent of another's teaching; "instruction" is the knowledge produced by the teaching of another in the form of explanation, &c.

"Right knowledge" is a knowledge of the predicaments, soul, &c., according to their real nature, undisturbed by any illusion or doubt; as it has been said— "That knowledge, which embraces concisely or in detail the predicaments as they actually are, is called 'right knowledge' by the wise."

The meaning of this is as follows:—
asyārthaḥ- jñānāvaraṇakṣayopaśame satīndriyamanasī puraskṛtya vyāpṛtaḥ san yathārthaṃ manute sā mati|	Mati is that by which one cognises an object through the operation of the senses and the mind, all obstructions of knowledge being abolished.
jñānāvaraṇakṣayopaśame sati matijanitaṃ spaṣṭaṃ jñānaṃ śrutam|	Śruta is the clear knowledge produced by mati, all the obstructions of knowledge being abolished.

Kevala is that pure unalloyed knowledge for the sake of which ascetics practise various kinds of penance.

antargaṇikabhedastu savistarastatraivāgame'vagantavyaḥ|	But the full account of the further minute divisions must be got from the authoritative treatise above-mentioned.
saṃsaraṇakarmoṃcchittāvudyatasya śraddadhānasya jñānavataḥ pāpagamanakāraṇakriyānirvṛttiḥ samyakcaritram|	(c.) "Right conduct" is the abstaining from all actions tending to evil courses by one who possesses faith and knowledge, and who is diligent in cutting off the series of actions and their effects which constitutes mundane existence.

na yatpramādayogena jīvitavyaparopaṇam| carāṇāṃ sthāvarāṇāṃ ca tadahiṃsābrataṃ matam|	"The 'vow' of ahiṃsā is the avoidance of injuring life by any act of thoughtlessness in any movable or immovable thing.
priyaṃ pathyaṃ vacastathyaṃ sūnṛtaṃ bratamucyate||	"A kind, salutary, and truthful speech is called the 'vow' of sūnṛta.
tattathyamapi no tathyamapriyaṃ cāhitaṃ ca yat|	That truthful speech is not truthful, which is unkind to others and prejudicial.
anādānamadattasyāsteyavratamudīritam| bāhyāḥ prāṇā nṛṇāmarthoṃ haratā taṃ hatā hi te|	"The not taking what is not given is declared to be the 'vow' of asteya; the external life is a man's property, and, when it is killed, it is killed by some one who seizes it.
divyaudarikakāmānāṃ kṛtānumatakārikataiḥ| manovākkāyatastyāgo brahmāṣṭādaśadhā matam||	"The 'vow' of brahmacaryā (chastity) is eighteen-fold, viz., the abandonment of all desires,[19] heavenly or earthly, in thought, word, and deed, and whether by one's own action or by one's consent, or by one's causing another to act.
sarvabhāveṣu mūrchāyāstyāgaḥ syādaparigrahaḥ| yadasatsvapi jāyeta mūrchayā cittavilpavaḥ|	"The 'vow' of aparigraha is the renouncing of all delusive interest in everything that exists not; since bewilderment of thought may arise from a delusive interest even in the unreal.
bhāvanābhirbhāvitāni pañcabhiḥ pañcadhā kramāt| mahāvratāni lokasya sādhayantyavyayaṃ padam||	"When carried out by the five states of mind in a fivefold order, these great 'vows' of the world produce the eternal abode."

etāni samyagdarśanajñānacāritrāṇi militāni mokṣakāraṇaṃ na pratyekam| yathā rasāyanam| tathā cātra jñānaśraddhānācaraṇāni saṃbhūya phalaṃ sādhayanti na pratyekam|	These three, right intuition, right knowledge, and right conduct, when united, produce liberation, but not severally; just as, in the case of an elixir, it is the knowledge of what it is, faith in its virtues, and the actual application of the medicine,[21] united, which produce the elixir's effect, but not severally.
atra saṃkṣepatastāvajjīvājīvākhye dve tattve staḥ| tatra bodhātmako jīvaḥ| abodhātmakastvajīvaḥ|	Here we may say concisely that the tattvas or predicaments are two, jīva and ajīva; the soul, jīva, is pure intelligence; the non-soul, ajīva, is pure non-intelligence.
taduktaṃ padmanandinā - cidacid dve pare tattve vivekastadvivecanam| upādeyamupādeyaṃ heyaṃ heyaṃ ca ku rvataḥ||	Padmanandin has thus said— "The two highest predicaments are 'soul' and 'non-soul;' 'discrimination' is the power of discriminating these two, in one who pursues what is to be pursued, and rejects what is to be rejected.
heyaṃ hi kartṛrāgādi tatkāryamavivekitā| upādeyaṃ paraṃ jyotirupayogaikalakṣaṇama||iti||	The affection, &c., of the agent are to be rejected; these are objects for the non-discriminating; the supreme light [of knowledge] is alone to be pursued, which is defined as upayoga."

yadavocadvācakācāryaḥ- aupaśamikakṣāyikau bhāvau miśraśca jīvasya svatattva- maudayikapāriṇāmikau ca (ta.sū.2/1) iti|	"The aupaśamika, the Kṣāyika, and the 'mixed' states are the nature of the soul, and also the audayika and the Pāriṇāmika."

The Kṣāyika state arises when there is the absolute abolition of actions and their effects, as in final liberation.
ubhayātmā bhāvo miśraḥ| yathā jalasyārdhasvacchatā|	The "mixed" (miśra) state combines both these, as when water is partly pure.
karmoṃdaye sati bhavanbhāva audayikaḥ|	The audayika state is when actions arise [exerting an inherent influence on the future].
karmoṃpaśamādyanapekṣaḥsahajobhāvaścetanatvādiḥpāriṇāmikaḥ|	The Pāriṇāmika state is the soul's innate condition, as pure intelligence, &c., and disregarding its apparent states, as (1), (2), (3), (4).[26] This nature, in one of the above-described varieties, is the character of every soul whether happy or unhappy.
tadetadyathāsaṃbhavaṃ bhavyasyābhavyasya vā jīvasya svarūpamiti sūtrārthaḥ|	This is the meaning of the sūtra quoted above. This has been explained in the Svarūpa-sambodhana—
taduktaṃ svarūpasaṃbodhane jñānādbhinno na nābhinno bhinnābhinnaḥ kathaṃcana| jñānaṃ pūrvāparībhūtaṃ soyamātmeti kīrtitaḥ||	"Not different from knowledge, and yet not identical with it,—in some way both different and the same,—knowledge is its first and last; such is the soul described to be."
nanu bhedābhedayoḥ parasparaparihāreṇāvasthānādanyatarasyaiva vāstavatvādubhayātmakatvamayu ktamiti cet- tadayuktam| bādhe pramāṇābhāvāt|	If you say that, "As difference and identity are mutually exclusive, we must have one or the other in the case of the soul, and its being equally both is absurd," we reply, that there is no evidence to support you when you characterise it as absurd.
anupalambho hi bādhakaṃ pramāṇam| na sosti| samasteṣu vastuṣvanekāntāṃtmakatvasya syādvādino mate suprasiddhatvādityalam|	Only a valid non-perception[27] can thus preclude a suggestion as absurd; but this is not found in the present case, since (in the opinion of us, the advocates of the Syād-vāda) it is perfectly notorious that all things present a mingled nature of many contradictory attributes.
apare punarjīvājīvayoraparaṃ prapañcamācakṣate jīvākāśadharmā dharmapudgalāstikāyabhedāt|	Others lay down a different set of tattvas from the two mentioned above, jīva and ajīva; they hold that there are five astikāyas or categories,—jīva, ākāśa, dharma, adharma, and pudgala.
eteṣu pañcasu tattveṣu kālatrayasaṃbandhitayāstīti sthitivyapadeśaḥ| anekapradeśatvena śarīravatkāyavyapadeśaḥ|	To all these five we can apply the idea of "existence" (asti),[28] as connected with the three divisions of time, and we can similarly apply the idea of "body" (kāya),[29] from their occupying several parts of space.
tatra jīvā dvividhāḥ saṃsāriṇo muktāśca| bhavādbhavāntaraprāptimantaḥ saṃsāriṇaḥ| te ca dvividhāḥ, samanaskā amanaskāśca| tatra saṃjñinaḥ samanaskāḥ|	The jīvas (souls) are divided into two, the "mundane" and the "released." The "mundane" pass from birth to birth; and these are also divided into two, as those possessing an internal sense (samanaska), and those destitute of it (amanaska).
śikṣākriyālāpagrahaṇarūpā saṃjñā| tadvidhurāstvamanaskāḥ|	The former possesses saṃjñā, i.e., the power of apprehension, talking, acting, and receiving instruction; the latter are those without this power.
te cāmanaskā dvividhāḥ, trasasthāvarabhedāt|	These latter are also divided into two, as "locomotive" (trasa), or "immovable" (sthāvara).
tatra dvīndriyādayaḥ śaṅkhagaṇḍo- lakaprabhṛtayaścaturvidhāstrasāḥ| pṛthivyaptejovāyuvanaspatayaḥ sthāvarāḥ|	The "locomotive" are those possessing at least two senses [touch and taste], as shell-fish, worms, &c., and are thus of four kinds [as possessing two, three, four, or five senses]; the "immovable" are earth, water, fire, air, and trees.[30] But here a distinction must be made.
tatra mārgagata dhūliḥ pṛthivī| iṣṭakādiḥ pṛthivīkāyaḥ| pṛthivīkāyatvena yena gṛhītā sa pṛthivīkāyikaḥ| pṛthivīṃkāyatvena yo grahīṣyati sa pṛthivījīvaḥ| evamabādiṣvapi bhedacatuṣṭayaṃ yojyam|	The dust of the road is properly "earth," but bricks, &c., are aggregated "bodies of earth," and that soul by whom this body is appropriated becomes "earthen-bodied," and that soul which will hereafter appropriate it is the "earth-soul." The same four divisions must also be applied to the others, water, &c.
tatra pṛthivyādi kāyatvena gṛhītavanto grahīṣyantaśca sthāvarā gṛhyante na pṛthivyādipṛthivīkāyādayaḥ| teṣāmajīvatvāt| te ca sthāvarāḥ sparśanaike ndriyāḥ|	Now the souls which have appropriated or will appropriate the earth, &c., as their bodies, are reckoned as "immovable;" but earth, &c., and the "bodies of earth," &c., are not so reckoned, because they are inanimate.[31] These other immovable things, and such as only possess the one sense of touch, are considered as "released," since they are incapable of passing into any other state of existence.
bhavāntaraprāptividhurā muktāḥ| dharmādharmā- kāśāstikāyāsta ekatvaśālino niṣkriyāśca dravyasya deśāntaraprāptihetavaḥ|	Dharma, adharma, and ākāśa are singular categories [and not generic], and they have not the attribute of "action," but they are the causes of a substance's change of place.
tatra dharmādharmau prasiddhau|	Dharma, "merit," and adharma, "demerit," are well known.
āloke nāvacchinne nabhasi lokākāśapadavedanīye tayoḥ sarvatrāvasthitiḥ| gatisthityupagraho dharmādharmayorupakāraḥ| ata eva dharmāstikāyaḥ pravṛttyanumeyaḥ| adharmāstikāyaḥ sthityanumeyaḥ|	They assist souls in progressing or remaining stationary in the universally extended[32] sky [or ether] characterised by light, and also called Lokākāśa; hence the presence of the category "merit" is to be inferred from progress, that of "demerit" from stationariness.
anyavastupradeśamadhyenyasya vastunaḥ praveśovagāhaḥ| tadākāśakṛtyam|	The effect of ākāśa is seen when one thing enters into the space previously occupied by another.
sparśarasagandhavarṇavantaḥ pudgalāḥ (ta.sū.5/24)|	Pudgala, "body," possesses touch, taste, and colour.
te ca dvividhā aṇavaḥ skandhāśca|	Bodies are of two kinds, atomic and compound.
dyaṇukādayaḥ skandhāḥ| tatra dyaṇukādiskandhabhedādaṇvādirūtpadyate|	Atoms are produced by the separation of these binary and other compounds, while these arise from the conjunction of atoms.
kvacidbhedasaṃghātābhyāṃ skandhotpattiḥ (ta.sū.5/26) ata eva pūrayanti galantīti pudgalāḥ|	Compounds sometimes arise from separation and conjunction [combined]; hence they are called pudgalas, because they "fill" (pūr), and "dissolve" (gal).
kālasyānekapradeśatvābhāvenāstikāyatvābhāvepi dravyatvamasti| tallakṣaṇayogāt| taduktaṃ guṇaparyāyavad dravyam ( ta.sū.5/38) iti dravyāśrayā nirguṇāguṇā (ta.sū.5/39)| yathā jīvasya jñānatvādidharmarūpāḥ pudgalasya rūpatvādisāmānyasvabhāvāḥ| dharmādharmākāśakālānāṃ yathāsaṃbhavaṃ gatisthityavagāhavartanāhetutvādisāmānyāni guṇāḥ|	Although "time" is not properly an astikāya, because it does not occupy many separate parts of space [as mentioned in the definition], still it is a dravya [or tattva], as the definition will hold; "substance" (dravya) possesses "qualities and action."[34] Qualities reside in substance but do not themselves possess qualities, as the general qualities, knowledge, &c., of the jīva, form, &c., of the body, and the power of causing progress, stationariness, and motion into a place previously occupied, in the case respectively of "merit," "demerit," and ākāśa.
utpādastadbhāvaḥ pariṇāmaḥ paryāya iti paryāyāḥ| yathā jīvasya ghaṭādijñānasukhakleśādayaḥ| pudgalasya mṛtpiṇḍaghaṭādayaḥ|	"Action" (paryāya) has thus been defined; the actions (paryāyāḥ) of a substance are, as has been said, its existence, its production, its being what it is, its development, its course to the end, as, e.g., in the jīva, the knowledge of objects, as of a jar, &c., happiness, pain, &c.; in the pudgala, the lump of clay, the jar, &c.; in merit and demerit, the special functions of progress, &c.
dharmādīnāṃ gatyādiviśeṣāḥ ata eva ṣaḍ dravyāṇīti prasiddhiḥ|	Thus there are six substances or tattvas [i.e., the five above mentioned and "time"].
ke cana sapta tattavānīti varṇayanti|	Others reckon the tattvas as seven, as has been said—
tadāha- jīvājīvāsravabandhasaṃvaranirjaramokṣāstattvāni| (ta.sū.1/4) iti| tatra jīvājīvau nirūpitau|	"The tattvas are jīva, ajīva, āsrava, bandha, saṃvara, nirjarā, and mokṣa." Jīva and ajīva have been already described.
āsravo nirupyateaudārikādikāyādicalana- dvāreṇātmanaścalanaṃ yogapadavedanīyamāsravaḥ|	Āsrava is described as the movement of the soul called yoga,[35] through its participation in the movement of its various bodies, audārika, &c.
yathā salilāvagāhi dvāraṃ jalādyāsravaṇakāraṇatvādāsrava iti| nigadyate tathā yogapraṇāḍikayā karmāsravatīti sa yoga āsravaḥ|	As a door opening into the water is called āsrava, because it causes the stream to descend through it,[36] so this yoga is called āsrava, because by it as by a pipe actions and their consequences flow in upon the soul.
yathārdraṃ vastraṃ samantādvātānītaṃ reṇujātamupādatte tathā kaṣāyajalārdra ātmā yogānītaṃ karma sarvapradeśaigṛhnāti| yathā vā niṣṭaptāyaḥpiṇḍo jale kṣiptombhaḥ samantād gṛhnāti tathā kaṣāyoṣṇo jīvo yogānītaṃ karma samantādādatte|	Or, as a wet garment collects the dust brought to it from every side by the wind, so the soul, wet with previous sins, collects, by its manifold points of contact with the body, the actions which are brought to it by yoga. Or as, when water is thrown on a heated lump of iron, the iron absorbs the water altogether, so the jīva, heated by previous sins, receives from every side the actions which are brought by yoga.
kaṣati hinastyātmānaṃ ku gatiprāpaṇāditi kaṣāyaḥ krodho māno māyā lobhaśca|	Kaṣāya ("sin," "defilement") is so called because it "hurts" (kash) the soul by leading it into evil states; it comprises anger, pride, delusion, and lust.
sa dvividhaḥ śubhāśubhabhedāt|	Āsrava is twofold, as good or evil.
atrāhiṃsādiḥ śubhaḥ kāyayogaḥ| satyamitahitabhāṣaṇādiḥ śubho vāgyogaḥ|	Thus abstaining from doing injury is a good yoga of the body; speaking what is true, measured, and profitable is a good yoga of the speech.
tadetadāsravabhedaprabhedajātaṃ kāyavāṅmanaḥ- karmayogaḥ| sa āsravaḥ| śubhaḥ puṇyasya|	"Āsrava is the impulse to action with body, speech, or mind, and it is good or evil as it produces merit or demerit," &c.
apare tvevaṃ menireāsravayati puruṣaṃ viṣayeṣyindriyapravṛttirāsravaḥ| indriyadvārā hi pauruṣaṃ jyotirviṣayānspṛśadrūpādijñānarūpeṇa pariṇamata iti|	Others, however, explain it thus:—"Āsrava is the action of the senses which impels the soul towards external objects; the light of the soul, coming in contact with external objects by means of the senses, becomes developed as the knowledge of form, &c."[37]
mithyādarśanāviratipramādakaṣāyavaśādyogavaśāccātmā sūkṣmaikakṣetrāvagāhināmanantapradeśānāṃ pudgālānāṃ karmabandhayogyānāmādānamupaśleṣaṇaṃ yatkaroti sa bandhaḥ| taduktaṃ sakaṣāyatvājjīvaḥ karmabhāva- yogyānpudgalānādatte sa bandhaḥ|	Bandha, "bondage," is when the soul, by the influence of "false intuition," "non-indifference," "carelessness," and "sin" (kaṣāya), and also by the force of yoga, assumes various bodies occupying many parts of space, which enter into its own subtile body, and which are suited to the bond of its previous actions.

tatra kaṣāyagrahaṇaṃ sarvabandhahetūpalakṣaṇārtham|	In this quotation the word "sin" (kaṣāya) is used to include the other three causes of bondage as well as that properly so termed.

(a) "False intuition" is twofold,—either innate from one's natural character, as when one disbelieves Jaina doctrines from the influence of former evil actions, irrespectively of another's teaching,—or derived, when learned by another's teaching.
pṛthivyādiṣaṭkopādānaṃ ṣaḍindriyāsaṃyamanaṃ cāviratiḥ|	(b) "Non-indifference" is the non-restraint of the five senses, and the internal organ from the set of six, earth, &c.
pañcasamiti- triguptiṣvanutsāhaḥ pramādaḥ|	(c) "Carelessness" (pramāda) is a want of effort to practise the five kinds of samiti, gupti, &c.
kaṣāyaḥ krodhādiḥ|	(d) "Sin" consists of anger, &c.
tatra kaṣāyāntāḥ sthityanubhavabandhahetavaḥ prakṛtipradeśabandhaheturyoṃga iti vibhāgāḥ|	Here we must make the distinction that the four things, false intuition, &c., cause those kinds of bondage called sthiti and anubhāva; yoga [or āsrava] causes those kinds called prakṛti and pradeśa.
bandhaścaturvidha ityuktaṃ prakṛtisthityanubhavapradeśāstadvidhayaḥ (ta.sū.8/3) iti|	"Bondage" is fourfold, as has been said: "Prakṛti, sthiti, anubhāva, and pradeśa are its four kinds."

This is (a) jnānāvaraṇa, or (b) darśanāvaraṇa.
sadasadvedanīyasya sukhaduḥkhotpādakatvamasidhārāmadhulehanavat|	(c) An object recognised as simultaneously existing or non-existing produces mingled pleasure and pain, as licking honey from a sword's edge,—this is vedanīya.
darśane mahanīyasya tattvārthāśraddhānakāritvaṃ durjana - saṅgavat| cāritre mohanīyasyāsaṃyamahetutvaṃ madyamadavat|	(d) A delusion (mohanīya) in intuition produces want of faith in the Jaina categories, like association with the wicked; delusion in conduct produces want of self-restraint, like intoxication.
āyuṣo dehabandhakartṛtvaṃ jalavat| nāmno vicitranāmakāritvaṃ citrikavat|	(e) Āyus produces the bond of body, like a snare.[40] (f) Nāman, or "the name," produces various individual appellations, as a painter paints his different pictures.
gotrasyoccanīcakāritvaṃ ku mbhakāravat|	(g) Gotra produces the idea of noble and ignoble, as the potter fashions his pots.
dānādīnāṃ vighnanidānatvamantarāyasya svabhāvaḥ kośādhyakṣavat|	(h) Antarāya produces obstacles to liberality, &c., as the treasurer hinders the king by considerations of economy.
soyaṃ prakṛtibandhoṣṭavidho dravyakarmāvāntara- bhedamūlaprakṛtivedanīyaḥ|	Thus is the prakṛti-bandha eightfold, being denominated as the eight mūla-prakṛtis, with subdivisions according to the different actions of the various subject-matter.

karmabhāvapariṇatapudgalaskandhānāmanantānta- pradeśānāmātmapradeśānupraveśaḥ pradeśabandhaḥ|	The bandha called pradeśa is the entrance into the different parts of the soul by the masses, made up of an endless number of parts, of the various bodies which are developed by the consequences of actions.
āsravanirodhaḥ saṃvaraḥ yenātmani praviśatkarma pratiṣidhyate sa guptisamityādiḥ saṃvaraḥ|	Saṃvara is the stopping of āsrava—that by which the influence of past actions (karman) is stopped from entering into the soul.
saṃcārakāraṇāyogādātmano gopanaṃ guptiḥ| sā trividhā kāyavāṅmanonigrahabhedāt|	Gupti is the withdrawal of the soul from that "impulse" (yoga) which causes mundane existence,—it is threefold, as relating to body, speech, or mind.
prāṇipīḍāparihāreṇa samyagayanaṃ samitiḥ|	Samiti is the acting so as to avoid injury to all living beings.
seryābhāṣādibhedātpañcadhā| prapañcitaṃ ca hemacandrācāryaiḥ|	This is divided into five kinds, as īryā,[44] bhāṣā, &c., as has been explained by Hemacandra.

sā nirjarā dvividhā yathākālaupakramikabhedāt|	This nirjarā is twofold,[51] "temporary" (yathākāla) and ancillary (aupakramaṇika).
tatra prathamā yasminkāle yatkarma phalapradatvenābhimataṃ tasminneva kāle phaladānādbhavantī nirjarā kāmādipākajeti ca jegīyate|	It is "temporary" as when a desire is dormant in consequence of the action having produced its fruit, and at that particular time, from this completion of the object aimed at, nirjarā arises, being caused by the consumption of the desire, &c.
yatkarma tapobalātsvakāmanayodayāvaliṃ praveśya prapadyate saupakramikanirjarā|	But when, by the force of asceticism, the sage turns all actions into means for attaining his end (liberation), this is the nirjarā of actions.
yadāha - saṃsārabījabhūtānāṃ karmaṇāṃ jaraṇādiha| nirjarā saṃmatā dvedhā sakāmākāmanirjarā||	Thus it has been said: "From the decaying of the actions which are the seeds of mundane existence, nirjarā arises, which is twofold, sakāmā and akāmā.
smṛtā sakāmā yamināmakāmā tvanyadehināma||iti||	That called sakāmā belongs to ascetics, the akāmā to other embodied spirits."[52]

Since at the moment of its attainment there is an entire absence of all future actions, as all the causes of bondage (false perception, &c.) are stopped,[53] and since all past actions are abolished in the presence of the causes of nirjarā, there arises the absolute release from all actions,—this is mokṣa; as it has been said: "Mokṣa is the absolute release from all actions by the decay (nirjarā) of the causes of bondage and of existence."

anyonyaṃ pradeśānupraveśe satyavibhāgenāvasthānaṃ bandhaḥ| parasparaprāptimātraṃ saṅgaḥ|	"Bondage" is the condition of being unseparated, with a mutual interpenetration of parts [between the soul and the body]; saṅga is merely mutual contact.

anye tu gatasamastakleśatadvāsanasyānāvaraṇajñānasya sukhaikatānasyātmana uparideśāvasthānaṃ muktirityāsthiṣata|	Others hold mokṣa to be the abiding in the highest regions, the soul being absorbed in bliss, with its knowledge unhindered and itself untainted by any pain or impression thereof.
evamuktāni sukhaduḥkhasādhanābhyāṃ puṇyapāpābhyāṃ sahitāni nava padārthān ke canāṅgīcakruḥ|	Others hold nine tattvas, adding "merit" and "demerit" to the foregoing seven,—these two being the causes of pleasure and pain.

As our object is only a summary, we desist here.

All this Anantavīrya has thus laid down:—
syānnāstīti prayogaḥ syāttanniṣedhe vivakṣite||	"When you wish to establish a thing, the proper course is to say 'may be, it is;' when you wish to deny it, 'may be, it is not.'
krameṇobhayavāñchāyāṃ prayogaḥ samudāyabhāk| yugapattadvivakṣāyāṃ syādavācyamaśaktitaḥ|	"When you desire to establish each in turn, let your procedure likewise embrace both; when you wish to establish both at once, let it be declared 'indescribable' from the impossibility to describe it.
ādyāvācyavivakṣāyāṃ pañcamo bhaṅga iṣyate| antyāvācyavivakṣāyāṃ ṣaṣṭhabhaṅgasamudbhavaḥ||	"The fifth process is enjoined when you wish to establish the first as well as its indescribableness; when the second as well as its indescribableness, the occasion for the sixth process arises.
samuccayena yuktaśca saptamo bhaṅga ucyate||	"The seventh is required when all three characters are to be employed simultaneously."
syācchabdaḥ khalvayaṃ nipātastiṅantapratirūpa- ko'nekāntadyotakaḥ| yathoktam - vākyeṣvanekāntadyotī gamyaṃ prati viśeṣaṇam|	Syāt, "may be," is here an indeclinable particle in the form of a part of a verb, used to convey the idea of indeterminateness; as it has been said—
yadi punarekāntadyotakaḥ syācchabdoyaṃ syāttadā syādastīti vākye syātpadamanarthakaṃ syāt| anekāntadyotakatve tu syādasti kathaṃ cidastīti syātpadātkathaṃcidityayamarthoṃ labhyata iti nānarthakyam|	If, again, the word syāt denoted determinateness, then it would be needless in the phrase, "may be, it is;" but since it really denotes indeterminateness, "may be, it is," means "it is somehow;" syāt, "may be," conveys the meaning of "somehow," kathaṃcit; and so it is not really useless.
tadāha - syādvādaḥ sarvathaikāntatyāgātkiṃ vṛttacidvidheḥ| saptabhaṅginayāpekṣo heyādeyaviśeṣakṛta||iti||	"The doctrine of the syād-vāda arises from our everywhere rejecting the idea of the absolute;[56] it depends on the sapta-bhaṅgī-naya, and it lays down the distinction between what is to be avoided and to be accepted."
yadi vastvastyekāntataḥ sarvathā sarvadā sarvatra sarvātmanāstīti nopāditsājihāsābhyāṃ kvacitkadācitke nacitpravarteta nivarteta vā| prāptāprāpaṇīyatvādaheyahānānupapatteśca|	If a thing absolutely exists, it exists altogether, always, everywhere, and with everybody, and no one at any time or place would ever make an effort to obtain or avoid it, as it would be absurd to treat what is already present as an object to be obtained or avoided.
anekāntapakṣe tu kathaṃcitkacitke nacitsattvena hānopādāne prekṣāvatāmupapadyete|	But if it be relative (or indefinite), the wise will concede that at certain times and in certain places any one may seek or avoid it.

The real nature of the thing cannot be being, for then you could not properly use the phrase, "It is a pot" (ghaṭósti), as the two words "is" and "pot" would be tautological; nor ought you to say, "It is not a pot," as the words thus used would imply a direct contradiction; and the same argument is to be used in other questions.[57] As it has been declared—
yathoktam - ghaṭostīti na vaktavyaṃ sanneva hi yato ghaṭaḥ|	"It must not be said 'It is a pot,' since the word 'pot' implies 'is;'
nāstītyapi na vaktavyaṃ virodhātsadasattvayoḥ|| ityādi||	"Nor may you say 'it is not a pot,' for existence and non-existence are mutually exclusive," &c.

Four classes of our opponents severally hold the doctrine of existence, non-existence, existence and non-existence successively, and the doctrine that everything is inexplicable (anirvacanīyatā);[58] three other classes hold one or other of the three first theories combined with the fourth.[59] Now, when they meet us with the scornful questions, "Does the thing exist?" &c., we have an answer always possible, "It exists in a certain way," &c., and our opponents are all abashed to silence, and victory accrues to the holder of the Syād-vāda, which ascertains the entire meaning of all things.

antarāyastathā nidrā bhīrajñānaṃ jugupsitam||	The Jaina doctrine has thus been summed up by Jinadatta-sūri—

jñānadarśanacāritrāṇyapavargasya vartanī||3||	The path[62] of emancipation consists of knowledge, intuition, and conduct.
syādvādasya pramāṇe dve pratyakṣamanumāpi ca|	There are two means of proof (pramāṇa) in the Syād-vāda doctrine,—sense-perception and inference.

puṇyasya saṃvare pāpasyāsrave kriyate punaḥ||8||	But by some teachers "merit" is included in saṃvara,[64] and "demerit" in āsrava.
labdhānantacatuṣkasya lokāgūḍhasya cātmanaḥ| kṣīṇāṣṭakarmaṇo muktiǔârnavyāvṛttirjinoditā||9||	"Of the soul which has attained the four infinite things[65] and is hidden from the world, and whose eight actions are abolished, absolute liberation is declared by Jina.
sarajoharaṇā bhaikṣabhujo luñcitamūrdhajāḥ| śvetāmbarāḥ kṣamāśīlā niḥsaṅgā jainasādhavaḥ||10||	The Śvetāmbaras are the destroyers of all defilement, they live by alms,[66] they pluck out their hair, they practise patience, they avoid all association, and are called the Jaina Sādhus.
luñcitāḥ picchikāhastāḥ pāṇipātrā digambarāḥ| ūrdhvāśino gṛhe dāturdvitīyāḥ syurjinarṣayaḥ||11||	The Digambaras pluck out their hair, they carry peacocks' tails in their hands, they drink from their hands, and they eat upright in the giver's house,—these are the second class of the Jaina Ṛṣis.
bhuṅkte na ke valī na strī mokṣameti digambaraḥ| prāhureṣāmayaṃ bhedo mahāñśvetāmbaraiḥ saha||12||iti||	"A woman attains not the highest knowledge, she enters not Mukti,—so say the Digambaras; but there is a great division on this point between them and the Śvetāmbaras."[67]
tadetadārhatamataṃ prāmāṇikagarhaṇamarhati| na hyekasminvastuni paramārthe sati paramārthasatāṃ yugapatsadasattvādidharmāṇāṃ samāveśaḥ saṃbhavati|	This doctrine of the Ārhatas deserves a rational condemnation, for whereas there is only one thing really existent, the simultaneous co-existence of existence, non-existence and other modes in a plurality of really existing things is an impossibility.
na ca sadasattvayoḥ parasparaviruddhayoḥ samuccayāsaṃbhave vikalpaḥ kiṃ na syāditi vaditavyam| kriyā hi vikalpyate na vastviti nyāyāt|	Nor should any one say: Granting the impossibility of the co-existence of existence and non-existence, which are reciprocally contradictory, why should there not be an alternation between existence and non-existence? there being the rule that it is action, not Ens, that alternates.
na ca enakāntaṃ jagatsarvaṃ herambanarasiṃhavat| iti dṛṣṭāntāvaṣṭambhavaśādeṣṭavyam| ekasmindeśe gajatvaṃ siṃhatvaṃ vā'parasminnaratvamiti deśabhedena virodhābhāvena tasyaikasmindeśa eva sattvāsattvādinānekāntatvābhidhāne dṛṣṭāntānupapatteḥ|	Nor let it be supposed that the whole universe is multiform, in reliance upon the examples of the elephant-headed Gaṇeśa and of the incarnation of Viṣṇu as half man, half lion; for the elephantine and the leonine nature existing in one part, and the human in another, and consequently there being no contradiction, those parts being different, these examples are inapplicable to the maintenance of a nature multiform as both existent and non-existent in one and the same part (or place).
nanu dravyātmanā satvaṃ paryāyātmanā tadabhāva ityubhayamapyupapannamiti cainmaivam| kālabhedena hi kasyācitsattvamasattvaṃ ca svabhāva iti na kaściddoṣaḥ|	Again, if any one urge: Let there be existence in one form, and non-existence in another, and thus both will be compatible; we rejoin: Not so, for if you had said that at different times existence and non-existence may be the nature of anything, then indeed there would have been no vice in your procedure.

tasmātpramāṇābhāvādyugapaṃtsattvāsattve parasparaviruddhe naikasminvastuni vastuṃ yukte |	Therefore, for want of evidence, existence and non-existence as reciprocally contradictory cannot reside at the same time in the same thing.
evamanyāsāmapibhaṅgīnāṃ bhaṅgovagantavyaḥ|	In a like manner may be understood the refutation of the other bhaṅgas (Ārhata tenets).
kiṃ ca sarvasyāsya mūlabhūtaḥ saptabhaṅginayaḥ svayamekontonekānto vā| ādye sarvamanekāntamiti pratijñāvyāghātaḥ|	Again, we ask, is this doctrine of the seven bhaṅgas, which lies at the base of all this, itself uniform (as excluding one contradictory), or multiform (as conciliating contradictories).
dvitīye vivakṣitārthāsiddhiḥ| anekāntatvenāsādhakatvāt| tathā ceyamubhayataḥpāśā rajjuḥ syādvādinaḥ syāt|	If it is uniform, there will emerge a contradiction to your thesis that all things are multiform; if it is multiform, you have not proved what you wished to prove, a multiform statement (as both existent and non-existent) proving nothing.[1] In either case, there is rope for a noose for the neck of the Syād-Vādin.

tathā jīvasya dehānurūpaparimāṇa- tvāṅgīkāre yogabalādanekadehaparigrāhakayogiśarīreṣu pratiśarīraṃ jīvavicchedaḥ prasajyeta|	In like manner if it be admitted that the soul has (as the Ārhatas say), an extension equal to that of the body, it will follow that in the case of the souls of ascetics, who by the efficacy of asceticism assume a plurality of bodies, there is a differentiation of the soul for each of those bodies.

taduktaṃ bhagavatā vyāsena-naikasminnasaṃbhavāt (bra.sū.2/2/31) iti| rāmānujena ca jainamatanirākaraṇaparatvena tadidaṃ sūtraṃ vyākāri|	The venerated Vyāsa accordingly propounded the aphorism (ii. 2, 33), "Nay, because it is impossible in one;" and this same aphorism has been analysed by Rāmānuja with the express purpose of shutting out the doctrine of the Jainas.
eṣa hi tasya siddhāntaḥ cidacidīśvarabhedena bhoktṛbhogyaniyāmakabhedena ca vyavasthitāstrayaḥ padārthā iti|	The tenets of Rāmānuja are as follows:—Three categories are established, as soul, not-soul, and Lord; or as subject, object, and supreme disposer.
taduktam - īśvaraścidaciśceti padārthatritayaṃ hariḥ|	Thus it has been said— "Lord, soul, and not-soul are the triad of principles: Hari (Viṣṇu)

tatrāyaṃ samādhirabhidhīyate| bhavedetadevaṃ yadyavidyāyāṃ pramāṇaṃ vidyeta|	To all this the following counterposition is laid down:—This might be all well enough if there were any proof of such illusion.
nanvidamanādi bhāvarūpaṃ jñānanivartyamajñānamahamajño mānanyaṃ ca na jānāmīti pratyakṣapramāṇasiddham|	But there is no such ignorance (or illusion), an unbeginning entity, suppressible by knowledge, testified in the perceptions, I am ignorant, I know not myself and other things.
taduktam - anādi bhāvarūpaṃ yadvijñānena vilīyate|	Thus it has been said (to explain the views of the Śāṅkara)—

nādyaḥ - svarūpapararūpābhyāṃ nityaṃ sadasadātmake |	"By means of its own and of another's form, eternal in the existent and non-existent,

abhāvasya ṣaṣṭhapramāṇagocaratvena jñānasya nityānumeyatvena ca tadabhāvasya pratyakṣaviṣayatvānupapatteḥ|	Non-entity being cognisable by the sixth instrument of knowledge (anupalabdhi), and knowledge being always an object of inference, the absence of knowledge cannot be an object of perception.

If there is such apprehension, consciousness of the absence of knowledge will be impossible, as involving a contradiction.

Inasmuch (the Śāṅkaras continue) as the foregoing difficulties do not occur if ignorance (or illusion) be entitative, this consciousness (I am ignorant, I know not myself, and other things) must be admitted to be conversant about an entitative ignorance.
tadetadgaganaromanthāyitam|	All this (the Rāmānuja replies) is about as profitable as it would be for a ruminant animal to ruminate upon ether; for an entitative ignorance is not more supposable than an absence of knowledge.

If it is presented, how, since ignorance of a thing is terminable by knowledge of its essence, can the ignorance continue? If none such is presented, how can we be conscious of an ignorance which has no subject and no object? If you say: A pure manifestation of the spiritual essence is revealed only by the cognition opposed to ignorance (or illusion), and thus there is no absurdity in the consciousness of ignorance accompanied with a consciousness of its subject and object; then we rejoin:—Unfortunately for you, this (consciousness of subject) must arise equally in the absence of knowledge (for such we define illusion to be), notwithstanding your assertion to the contrary.
tasmādubhayābhyupagatajñānābhāva evāhamajño mānanyaṃ ca na jānāmītyanubhavagocara ityabhyupagantavyam|	It must, therefore, be acknowledged that the cognition, I am ignorant, I know not myself and other things, is conversant about an absence of cognition allowed by us both.

na ca anṛtena hi pratyūḍhāḥ (chā.8/3/2) iti śrutiravidyāyāṃ pramāṇamityāśrayituṃ śakyam| ṛtetaraviṣayo hyanṛtaśabdaḥ|	It is not to be supposed that the Veda also affords evidence of the existence of the cosmical illusion, in the text, Enveloped in untruth (anṛta); for the word untruth (anṛta) denotes that which is other than truth (ṛta).
ṛtaṃ pibantau (kā.3/1) iti vacanāt|	The word ṛta has a passive sense, as appears from the words, Drinking ṛta.
ṛtaṃ tadvayatiriktaṃ sāṃsārikālpaphalaṃ karmānṛtaṃ brahmaprāptivirodhi|	Ṛta means works done without desire of fruit; having as its reward the attainment of the bliss of the Supreme Spirit through his propitiation.
ya etaṃ brahmalokaṃ na vindanti anṛtena hi pratyūḍhāḥ (chā.8/3/2) iti vacanāt|	In the text in question, untruth (anṛta) designates the scanty fruit enjoyed during transmigratory existence as opposed to that (which results from propitiation of the Supreme Spirit), which temporal fruit is obstructive to the attainment of supreme existence (brahman); the entire text (when the context is supplied) being: They who find not this supreme sphere (brahma-loka) are enveloped in untruth.
māyāṃ tu prakṛtiṃ vidyāt ( śve.4/10) ityādau māyā śabdo vicitrārthasargakaratriguṇātmakaprakṛtyabhidhāyako nānirvacanīyājñānavacanaḥ|	In such texts, again, as Let him know illusion (māyā) to be the primary emanative cause (prakṛti), the term (māyā) designates the emanative cause, consisting of the three "cords" (guṇa), and creative of the diversified universe.
tena māyāsahasraṃ tacchambarasyāśugāminā| bālasya rakṣatā dehamekai kāṃśena sūditam|| (vi.pu.1/19/20) ityādau vicitrārthasargasamarthasya pāramārthikasaivāsurādyastraviśeṣasyaiva māyāśabdābhidheyatvopalambhāt|	In such passages as, By him the defender of the body of the child, moving rapidly, the thousand illusions (māyā) of the barbarian were swooped upon as by a hawk, we observe that the word "illusion" (māyā) designates the really existent weapon of a Titan, capable of projective diversified creation.

tathā hi- tatpadaṃ nirastasamastadoṣamanavadhikātiśayā- saṃkhyeyakalyāṇaguṇāspadaṃ jagadudayavibhavalayalīlaṃ brahma pratipādayati| tadaikṣata bahu syāṃ prajāyeya (chā.6/2/3) ityādiṣu tasyaiva prakṛtatvāt|	The term That denotes the Supreme Spirit exempt from all imperfections, of illimitable excellence, a repository of innumerable auspicious attributes, to whom the emanation, sustentation, retractation of the universe is a pastime;[2] such being the Supreme Spirit, spoken of in such texts as, That desired, let me be many, let me bring forth.
tatsamānādhikaraṇaṃ tvaṃpadaṃ cācidviśiṣṭajīvaśarīrakaṃ brahmācaṣṭe| prakāradvayaviśiṣṭaikavastuparatvātsāmānādhikaraṇyasya|	Perhaps the word Thou, referring to the same object (as the word That), denotes the Supreme Spirit characterised by consciousness, having all individual spirits as his body; for a "reference to the same object" designates one thing determined by two modes.
nanu soyaṃ devadatta itivattattvamiti padayorviruddhabhāgatyāgalakṣaṇayā nirviśeṣasvarūpamātmaikyaṃ sāmānādhikaraṇyārthaḥ kiṃ na syāt| yathā soyamityatra tacchabdena deśāntarakālāntarasaṃbandhī puruṣaḥ pratīyate| idaṃśabdena ca saṃnihitadeśavartamānakālasaṃbandhī|	Here, perhaps, an Advaita-vādin may reply: Why may not the purport of the reference to the same object in the words, That art thou, be undifferenced essence, the unity of souls, these words (That and thou) having a (reciprocally) implicate power by abandonment of opposite portions of their meaning; as is the case in the phrase, This is that Devadatta. In the words, This is that Devadatta, we understand by the word That, a person in relation to a different time and place, and by the word This, a person in relation to the present time and place.
tayoḥ sāmānādhikaraṇyenaikya- mavagamyate|	That both are one and the same is understood by the form of predication ("reference to the same object").
tatraikasya yugapadviruddhadeśakālapratītirna saṃbhavatīti dvayorapi padayoḥ svarūpaparatve svarūpasya caikyaṃ pratipattuṃ śakyam|	Now as one and the same thing cannot at the same time be known as in different times and places, the two words (This and That) must refer to the essence (and not to the accidents of time and place), and unity of essence can be understood.
evamatrāpi kiṃ ciñjatvasarvajñatvādiviruddhāṃśaprahāṇenā- khaṇḍasvarūpaṃlakṣyata iti cet - viṣamoyamupanyāsaḥ|	Similarly in the text, That art thou, there is implicated an indivisible essence by abandonment of the contradictory portions (of the denotation), viz., finite cognition (which belongs to the individual soul or Thou), and infinite cognition (which belongs to the real or unindividual soul).
dṛṣṭāntepi virodhavaidhuryeṇa lakṣaṇāgandhāsaṃbhavāt|	This suggestion (the Rāmānujas reply) is unsatisfactory, for there is no opposition (between This and That) in the example (This is that Devadatta), and consequently not the smallest particle of "implication" (lakṣaṇā, both This and That being used in their denotative capacity).
ekasya tāvad bhūtavartamānakāladvayasaṃbaṃndho na viruddhaḥ|	The connection of one object with two times past and present involves no contradiction.
deśāntarasthitirbhūtā saṃnihitadeśasthitirvartata iti deśabhedasaṃbandhavirodhaśca kālabhedena pariharaṇīyaḥ|	And any contradiction supposed to arise from relation to different places may be avoided by a supposed difference of time, the existence in the distant place being past, and the existence in the near being present.

Otherwise (if we admit that both words are implicative), if it be granted that the one thing may be recognised, with the concomitant assurance that it differs as this and as that, permanence in things will be inadmissible, and the Buddhist assertor of a momentary flux of things will be triumphant.
evamatrāpi jīvaparamātmanoḥ śarīrātmabhāvena tādātmyaṃ na viruddhamiti pratipāditam|	We have, therefore (the Rāmānujas continue), laid it down in this question that there is no contradiction in the identity of the individual and the Supreme Spirit, the individual spirits being the body and the Supreme Spirit the soul.
jīvātmā hi brahmaṇaḥ śarīratayā prakāratvādrahyātmakaḥ| ya ātmani tiṣṭhannātmanontaro yamātmā na veda yasyātmā śarīram ( bṛ.bhā.3/7/22) iti śrutyantarāt|	For the individual spirit as the body, and therefore a form, of the Supreme Spirit, is identical with the Supreme Spirit, according to another text, Who abiding in the soul, is the controller of the soul, who knows the soul, of whom soul is the body.
atyalpamidamucyate|	Your statement of the matter, therefore, is too narrow.
sarve śabdāḥ paramātmana eva bācakāḥ|	All words are designatory of the Supreme Spirit.

All this may be ascertained from that work.

api ca brahmavyatiriktasya sarvasya mithyātve sarvasyāsattvādevaika- vijñānena sarvavijñānapratijñā vādhyeta|	Besides, if all else than absolute spirit were unreal, then all being non-existent, it would follow that by one cognition all cognition would be sublated.

Of these alternatives monism is admitted in saying that Supreme Spirit alone subsists in all forms as all is its body; both unity and plurality are admitted in saying that one only Supreme Spirit subsists under a plurality of forms diverse as soul and not-soul; and plurality is admitted in saying that the essential natures of soul, not-soul, and the Lord, are different, and not to be confounded.

Soul experiences fruition, and after reaping pleasures and pains proportionate to merits and demerits, there ensues knowledge of the Lord, or attainment of the sphere of the Lord.

(1.) "Adoration" is images, and so forth.
tatrārcā nāma pratimādayaḥ| rāmādyavatāro vibhavaḥ|	(2.) "Emanation" is his incarnation, as Rāma, and so forth.
vyūhaścurvidho vāsudevasaṃkarṣaṇapradyumnāniruddhasaṃjñakaḥ|	(3.) His "manifestation" is fourfold, as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarshaṇa, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha.

tatra pūrvapūrvamūtyupāsanayā puruṣārthaparipanthiduritanicayakṣaye satyuttarottaramūtyupāstyadhikāraḥ|	When by worshipping each former embodiment a mass of sins inimical to the end of the soul (i.e., emancipation) have been destroyed, the votary becomes entitled to practise the worship of each latter embodiment.
taduktam - vāsudevaḥ svabhakte ṣu vātsalyāttattadīhitam|	It has, therefore, been said— "Vāsudeva, in his tenderness to his votaries, gives, as desired by each,

sūkṣme tadanu śaktaḥ syādantaryāmiṇamīkṣitum||	"By the worship thereafter of 'the subtile,' he becomes able to behold the 'internal controller.'"
tadupāsanaṃ ca pañcavidhamabhigamanamupādānamijyā svādhyāyo yoga iti śrīpañcarātrebhihitam|	The worship of the Deity is described in the Pañca-rātra as consisting of five elements, viz., (1.) the access, (2.) the preparation, (3.) oblation, (4.) recitation, (5.) devotion.
tatrābhigamanaṃ nāma devatāsthānamārgasya saṃmārjanopalepanādi|	Of these, access is the sweeping, smearing, and so forth, of the way to the temple.
upādānaṃ gandhpuṣpādipūjā- sādhanasaṃpādanam|	The preparation is the provision of perfumes, flowers, and the like appliances of worship.
ijyā nāma devatāpūjanam|	Oblation is worship of the deities.
svādhyāyo nāma arthānusaṃdhānapūrvako mantrajapo vaiṣṇavasūktastotrapāṭho nāmasaṃkīrtanaṃ tattvapratipādakaśāstrābhyāsaśca|	Recitation is the muttered ejaculation of sacred texts, with attention to what they mean, the rehearsal of hymns and lauds of Viṣṇu, the commemoration of his names, and study of institutes which set forth the truth.
yogo nāma devatānusaṃghānam|	Devotion is meditation on the Deity.

tathā ca smṛtiḥ - māmupetya punarjanma duḥkhālayamaśāśvatam| nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ saṃsiṃddhiṃ paramāṃ gatāḥ|| (bha.gī.8/15) iti|	So the traditionary text— "When they have come to me, the high-souled no longer undergo future birth, a receptacle of pain, transitory, having attained to the supreme consummation.
svabhaktaṃ vāsudevopi saṃprāpyānandamakṣayam| punarāvṛttirahitaṃ svīyaṃ dhāma prayacchati||	"Vāsudeva, having found his votary, bestows upon him his own mansion, blissful, undecaying, from whence there is no more return."

tatrāthāto brahmajijñāsā (bra.sū.1/1/1) iti prathamasūtrasyāyamarthaḥ atrāthaśabdaḥ pūrvavṛttakarmādhigamanānantaryārthaḥ|	In this the sense of the first aphorism, "Then hence the absolute must be desired to be known," is given as follows:—The word then in this aphorism means, after understanding the hitherto-current sacred rites.
taduktaṃ vṛttikāreṇa- vṛttātkarmādhigamādanantaraṃ brahma vividiṣatīti|	Thus the glossator writes: "After learning the sacred rites," he desires to know the absolute.
ataḥśabdo hetvarthaḥ| adhītasāṅgavedasyā- dhigatatadarthasya vinaśvaraphalātkarmaṇo viraktatvāddhetoḥ sthiramokṣābhilāṣukasya tadupāyabhūta - brahmajijñāsā bhavati|	The word hence states the reason, viz., because one who has read the Veda and its appendages and understands its meaning is averse from sacred rites, their recompense being perishable. The wish to know the absolute springs up in one who longs for permanent liberation, as being the means of such liberation.
brahmaśabdena svabhāvato nirastasamastadoṣānavadhikātiśayāsaṃkhyeyakalyāṇa- guṇaḥ puruṣottamobhidhīyate|	By the word absolute is designated the Supreme Spirit, from whom are essentially excluded all imperfections, who is of illimitable excellence, and of innumerable auspicious attributes.
evaṃ ca karmajñānasya tadanuṣṭhānasya ca vairāgyotpādanadvārā cittakalmaṣāpanayadvārā ca brahmajñānaṃ prati sādhanatvena tayoḥ kāryakāraṇatvena pūrvoṃttaramīmāṃsayoreka- śāstratvam|	Since then the knowledge of sacred rites and the performance of those rites is mediately through engendering dispassionateness, and through putting away the defilement of the understanding, an instrument of the knowledge of the absolute; and knowledge of sacred rites and knowledge of the absolute being consequently cause and effect, the former and the latter Mīmānsā constitute one system of institutes.
ataeva vṛttikārā ekamevedaṃ śāstraṃ jaiminīyena ṣoḍaśalakṣaṇenetyāhuḥ|	On this account the glossator has described this system as one with the sixteenfold system of Jaimini.

ekai kanindayā karmaviśiṣṭasya jñānasya mokṣasādhanatvaṃ darśayati śrutiḥ- andhaṃ tamaḥ praviśanti ye'vidyāmupāsate| tato bhūya iva te tamo ya u vidyāyāṃ ratāḥ|| (bṛ.4/4/10,ī.9) vidyāṃ cāvidyāṃ ca yastadvedobhayaṃ saha| avidyayā mṛtyuṃ tītvā vidyayāmṛtamaśrnute|	Revelation, by censuring each when unaccompanied by the other, shows that it is knowledge together with works that is efficacious of emancipation, in the words: Blind darkness they enter who prefer illusion, and a greater darkness still do they enter who delight in knowledge only; knowledge and illusion, he who knows these both, he passing beyond death together with illusion, tastes immortality by knowledge.
(ī.11) ityādi| taduktaṃ pāñcarātrarahasye- sa eva karuṇāsindhurbhagavān bhaktavatsalaḥ|	Conformably it is said in the Pañcarātra-rahasya— "That ocean of compassion, the Lord, tender to his votaries,
upāsakānurodhena bhajate mūrtipañcakam||	"For his worshipper's sake takes five embodiments upon him.
tadarcāvibhava- vyūhasūkṣmāntaryāmisaṃjñakam|	"These are styled Adoration, Emanation, Manifestation, the Subtile, the Internal Controller,

uttarottarramūttīnāmupāstyadhikṛto bhavet|	"He becomes qualified for the worship of each next embodiment.
evaṃ hyaraharaḥ śrautasmārtadharmānusārataḥ|	"Thus day by day, according to religion, revealed and traditional,

tataḥ svābhāvikāḥ puṃsāṃ te saṃsāratirohitāḥ|	"Then in souls the essential attributes, from which transmigration has vanished,
āvirbhavanti kalyāṇāḥ sarvajñatvādayo guṇāḥ|	"Are manifested, auspicious, omniscience, and the rest.
evaṃ guṇāḥ samānāḥ syurmuktānāmīśvarasya ca|	"These qualities are common to the emancipated spirits and the Lord,

muktāstu śeṣiṇi brahmaṇyaśeṣe śeṣarūpiṇaḥ|	"Emancipated spirits are ulterior to the infinite absolute, which is unsusceptible of aught ulterior;
sarvānaśnuvate kāmān saha tena vipaścitā||iti||	"They enjoy all beatitudes together with that Spirit."
tasmāttāpatrayāturairamṛtatvāya puruṣottamādipadavedanīyaṃ brahma jijñāsitavyamityuktaṃ bhavati|	It is therefore stated that those who suffer the three kinds of pain must, for the attainment of immortality, investigate the absolute spirit known under such appellations as the Highest Being.
prakṛtipratyayau pratyayārthaṃ prādhānyena saha brūta itaḥ sanonyatreti vacanabalādicchāyā iṣyamāṇapradhānatvādiṣyamāṇaṃ jñānamiha vidheyam|	According to the maxim: The base and the suffix convey the meaning conjointly, and of these the meaning of the suffix takes the lead, the notion of desire is predominant (in the word jijñāsitavya), and desired knowledge is the predicate (in the aphorism, Then hence the absolute must be desired to be known).
tacca dhyānopāsanādiśabdavācyaṃ vedanaṃ na tu vākyajanyamāpātajñānam| padasaṃdarbhaśrāviṇo vyutpannasya vidhānamantareṇāpi prāptatvāt| ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyaḥ (bṛ.2/4/5) ātmetyavopāsīta (bṛ.1/4/7) vijñāya prajñāṃ ku rvīta (bṛ.4/4/21) anuvidya vijānāti chā.8/7/1) ityādiśrutibhyaḥ|	Knowledge is cognition designated by such terms as meditation, devotion; not the merely superficial knowledge derived from verbal communication, such being competent to any one who hears a number of words and understands the force of each, even without any predication; in conformity with such Vedic texts as: Self indeed it is that is to be seen, to be heard, to be thought, to be pondered; He should meditate that it is self alone; Having known, let him acquire excellent wisdom; He should know that which is beyond knowledge.

mantavya iti cānuvādaḥ| śravaṇapratiṣṭhārthatvena mananasyāpi prāptatvāt| aprāpte śāstramarthavaditi nyāyāt|	The term "to be thought" (or "to be inferred") is also explanatory, cogitation (or inference) being understood as the complementary meaning of hearing, according to the aphorism: Before its signification is attained the system is significant.
dhyānaṃ ca tailadhārāvadavicchinnasmṛtisaṃtānarūpam| dhruvā smṛtiḥ smṛtipratilambhe sarvagranthīnāṃ vipramokṣa iti dhruvāyāḥ smṛtereva mokṣopāyatvaśravaṇāt|	Meditation is a reminiscence consisting of an unbroken succession of reminiscences like a stream of oil, it being revealed in the text, in continuity of reminiscence there is a solution of all knots,—that it is unintermittent reminiscence that is the means of emancipation.
sā ca smṛtirdarśanasamānākārā|	And this reminiscence is tantamount to intuition.
bhidyate hṛdayagranthiśchidyante sarvasaṃśayāḥ|	"Cut is his heart's knot, solved are all his doubts,

(mu. 2/2/8) ityanenaikavākyatvāt|	because he becomes one with that Supreme.
tathā ca ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ (vṛ.2/4/5) ityanenāsyādarśanarūpatā vidhīyate|	So also in the words, Self indeed is to be seen, it is predicated of this reminiscence that it is an intuition.
bhavati ca bhāvanā prakarṣātsmṛterdarśanarūpatvam|	Reminiscence becomes intuitional through the vivacity of the representations.
vākyakāreṇaitatsarvaṃ prapaña◌āi◌◌cataṃ vedanamupāsanaṃ syādityādinā|	The author of the Vākya has treated of all this in detail in the passage beginning Cognition is meditation.
tadeva dhyānaṃ viśinaṣṭi śrutiḥ - nāyamātmā pravacanena labhyo na medhayā na bahunā śrutena|	The characters of this meditation are laid out in the text: This soul is not attainable by exposition, nor by wisdom, nor by much learning; Whom God chooses by him God may be attained.
yamevaiṣa vṛṇute tena lambhastasyaiva ātmā vivṛṇute tanūṃsvām||	To him this self unfolds its own nature.

dadāmi buddhiyogaṃ taṃ yena māmupayānti te||	"I give the devotion of understanding whereby they come to me."
(bha.gī.10.10) iti|	And again—
puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ pārtha bhaktyā lamyastvananyayā|	"That Supreme Spirit, Arjuna, is attainable by faith unwavering."
bhaktistu niratiśayānandapriyānanyaprayojanasakaletaravaitṛṣṇyavajjānaviśeṣa eva|	But devotion (or faith) is a kind of cognition which admits no other motive than the illimitable beatitude, and is free from all other desires; and the attainment of this devotion is by discrimination and other means.
tatsiddhiśca vivekādibhyo bhavatīti vākyakāreṇoktaṃ tallabdhirvivekavimokābhyāsakriyākalyāṇāna- vasādānuddharṣebhyaḥ saṃbhavānnirvacanācceti|	As is said by the author of the Vākya: Attainment thereof results from discrimination (viveka), exemption (vimoka), practice (abhyāsa), observance (kriyā), excellence (kalyāṇa), freedom from despondency (anavasāda), satisfaction (anuddharsha), according to the equivalence (of the definition), and the explication (of these terms).
tatra viveko nāmādaṣṭādannātsattvaśuddhi uḥ| atra nirvacanama - āhāraśuddheḥ sattvaśuddhiḥ sattvaśuddhayā dhruvā smṛtiriti|	Of these means, discrimination is purity of nature, resultant from eating undefiled food, and the explication (of discrimination) is From purity of diet, purity of understanding, and by purity of understanding the unintermittent reminiscence.
vimokaḥ kāmānabhiṣvaṅgaḥ| śānta upāsīteti nirvacanam|	Exemption is non-attachment to sensuous desires; the explication being, Let the quietist meditate.
punaḥ punaḥ saṃśīlanamabhyāsaḥ| nirvacanaṃ ca smārtamudāhṛtaṃ bhāṣyakāreṇa 'sadā tadbhāvanāvitaḥ (gī.8/6) iti|	Practice is reiteration; and of this a traditionary explication is quoted (from the Bhagavad-gītā) by (Rāmānuja) the author of the commentary: For ever modified by the modes thereof.
śrautasmārtakarmānuṣṭhānaṃ śaktitaḥ kriyā| kriyāvāneṣa brahmavidāṃ variṣṭha iti nirvacanam|	Observance is the performance of rites enjoined in revelation and tradition according to one's ability; the explication being (the Vedic text), He who has performed rites is the best of those that know the supreme.
satyārjavadayādānādīni kalyāṇāni| satyena labhyata ityādi nirvacanam|	The excellences are veracity, integrity, clemency, charity (alms-giving), and the like; the explication being, It is attained by veracity.
dainyaviparyayonavasādaḥ| nāyamātmā balahīnena labhyaḥ (mu.3/2/4) iti nirvacanam|	Freedom from despondency is the contrary of dejection; the explication being, This soul is not attained by the faint-hearted.
tadviparyayajātuṣṭiruddharṣaḥ| tadviparyayonuddharṣaḥ| śānto dānta iti nirvacanam|	Satisfaction is the contentment which arises from the contrary of dejection; the explication being, Quiescent, self-subdued.

taduktaṃ yāmunena ubhayaparikarmitasvāntasyaikāntikātyantika- bhaktiyogo labhya iti| jñānakarmayogasaṃskṛtāntaḥkaraṇasyetyarthaḥ|	Thus Yāmuna says: Attainable by the final and absolute devotion of faith in one internally purified by both (works and knowledge); that is, in one whose internal organ is rectified by the devotion of works and knowledge.
kiṃ punarbrahma jijñāsitavyamityapekṣāyāṃ lakṣaṇamuktaṃ 'janmādyasya yataḥ' (vra.sū.1/1/2) iti|	In anticipation of the inquiry, But what absolute is to be desired to be known? the definition is given (in the second aphorism). From which the genesis, and so forth, of this.
janmādīti sṛṣṭisthitipralayam|	The genesis, and so forth, the creation (emanation), sustentation, and retractation (of the universe).

itthaṃbhūte brahmaṇi kiṃ pramāṇamiti jijñāsāyāṃ śāstrameva pramāṇamityuktaṃ śāstrayonitvāt (vra.sū.1/1/3) iti|	In anticipation of the further inquiry, What proof is there of an absolute of this nature? It is stated that the system of institutes itself is the evidence (in the third aphorism): Because it has its source from the system.
śāstraṃ yoniḥ kāraṇaṃ pramāṇaṃ yasya tacchāstrayoni|	To have its source from the system is to be that whereof the cause or evidence is the system.
tasya bhāvastattvaṃ tasmāt| brahmajñānakāraṇatvācchāstrasya tadyonitvaṃ brahmaṇa ityarthaḥ|	The system, then, is the source (or evidence) of the absolute, as being the cause of knowing the self, which is the cause of knowing the absolute.
na ca brahmaṇaḥ pramāṇantaragamyatvaṃ śaṅkituṃ śakyam| atīndriyatvena pratyakṣasya tatra pravṛttyanupapatteḥ|	Nor is the suspicion possible that the absolute may be reached by some other form of evidence. For perception can have no conversancy about the absolute since it is supersensible.
nāpi mahārṇavādikaṃ sakartṛkaṃ kāryatvāddhaṭavadityanumānam| tasya pūtikū ṣmāṇḍāyamānatvāt|	Nor can inference, for the illation, the ocean, and the rest, must have a maker, because it is an effect like a water-pot, is worth about as much as a rotten pumpkin.
tallakṣaṇaṃ brahma 'yato vā imāni bhūtāni' (taḍha.2/1/1) ityādivākyaṃ pratipādayatīti sthitam|	It is evinced that it is such texts as, Whence also these elements, that prove the existence of the absolute thus described.
yadyapi brahma pramāṇantaragocaratāṃ nāvatarati tathāpi pravṛtti nivṛttiparatvābhāve siddharūpaṃ brahma na śāstraṃ pratipādayituṃ prabhavatītyatatparyanuyogaparihāyoktaṃ - tattu samanvayāt ( bra.sū. 1/1/4) iti|	Though the absolute (it may be objected) be unsusceptible of any other kind of proof, the system, did it not refer to activity and cessation of activity, could not posit the absolute aforesaid. To avoid by anticipation any queries on this point, it is stated (in the fourth aphorism): But that is from the construction.
tuśabdaḥ prasaktāśaṅkāvyāvṛttyarthaḥ|	This is intended to exclude the doubt anticipated.
tacchāstrapramāṇakatvaṃ brahmaṇaḥ saṃbhavatyeva|	The evidence, then, of the system is the only evidence that can be given of the absolute.
ku taḥ samanvayāt|	Why? Because of the construction, that is because the absolute, that is, the highest end for man, is construed as the subject (of the first aphorism, viz., Then thence the absolute is to be desired to be known).
paramapuruṣārthabhūtasyaiva brahmaṇobhidheyatayānvayādityarthaḥ na ca pravṛttinivṛttyoranyataravirahiṇaḥ prayojanaśūnyatvam| svarūpapareṣvapi putraste jāto nāyaṃ sarpa ityādiṣu harṣaprāptibhayanivṛtti- rūpaprayojanavattvaṃ dṛṣṭameveti na kiṃ cidanupapannam|	Moreover, a sentence which has nothing to do either with activity or with cessation of activity is not therefore void of purpose, for we observe that sentences merely declaratory of the nature of things, such as, A son is born to you, This is not a snake, convey a purpose, viz., the cessation of joy or of fear. Thus there is nothing unaccounted for.
diṅmātramatra pradarśitam|	We have here given only a general indication.
vistarastvākarādevā- vagantavya iti vistārabhīruṇodāsyata iti sarvamanāku lam|| atha pūrṇaprajñadarśanam ||5||	The details may be learnt from the original (viz., Rāmānuja's Bhāṣya on the Vedānta aphorisms); we therefore decline a further treatment, apprehensive of prolixity; and thus all is clear.[4]

tanmate hi dvividhaṃ tattvaṃ svatantraparatantrabhedāt| taduktaṃ tattvaviveke - svatantraṃ paratantraṃ ca dvividhaṃ tattvamiṣyate|	For in his doctrine ultimate principles are dichotomised into independent and dependent; as it is stated in the Tattva-viveka:— "Independent and dependent, two principles are received;
svatantro bhagavānviṣṇurnirdoṃṣo'śeṣasadguṇaḥ||iti|	"The independent is Viṣṇu the Lord, exempt from imperfections, and of inexhaustible excellences."
nanu sajātīya-vijātīya-svagata-nānātvaśūnyaṃ brahma tattavamiti pratipādake ṣu vedānteṣu jāgaruke ṣu kathamaśeṣasadguṇatvaṃ kathyata iti cet, maivam| bhedupramāpakabahapramāṇavirodhena teṣāṃ tatra prāmāṇyānupapatteḥ| tathā hi, pratyakṣaṃ tāvadidamasmādbhinnam iti nīlapītāderbhedamadhyakṣayati|	Here it will be urged (by the Advaita-vādins): Why predicate of the absolute these inexhaustible excellences in the teeth of the Upaniṣads, which lay down that the absolute principle is void of homogeneity and heterogeneity, and of all plurality in itself? To this be it replied: Not so, for these texts of the Upaniṣads, as contradictory of many proofs positive of duality, cannot afford proof of universal unity; perception, for example, in the consciousness, This is different from that, pronounces a difference between things, blue and yellow, and so forth.
atha manyethāḥ - kiṃ pratyakṣaṃ bhedamevāvagāhate kiṃ vā dharmipratiyogighaṭitam ? na prathamaḥ, dharmipratiyogipratiprattimantareṇa tatsāpekṣasya bhedasyāśakyādhyavasāyātvāt| dvitīye'pi dharmipratiyogigrahaṇapuraḥsaraṃ bhedagrahaṇamathavā yugapattatsarvagrahaṇam ? na pūrvaḥ, buddherviramya vyāpārābhāvāt| anyonyāśrayaprasaṅgācca|	On the latter alternative it must be asked, Is the apprehension of the difference preceded by an apprehension of the thing and its contrary, or are all the three (the thing, its contrary, and the contrariety) simultaneously apprehended? It cannot be thus preceded, for the operation of the intellect is without delay (or without successive steps), and there would also result a logical seesaw (apprehension of the difference presupposing apprehension of the thing and its contrary, and apprehension of the thing and its contrary presupposing apprehension of the difference).
nāpi caramaḥ, kāryakāraṇabuddhayoyauṃgapadyābhāvāt| dharmipratītirhi bhedapratyayasya kāraṇam| evaṃ pratiyogipratītirapi| saṃnihite'pi dharmiṇa vyavahitapratiyogijñānamantareṇa bhedasyājñātattvenānvaya- vyatirekābhyāṃ kāryakāraṇabhāvāvagamāt|	Nor can there be a simultaneous apprehension (of the thing, its contrary, and the difference); for cognitions related as cause and effect cannot be simultaneous, and the cognition of the thing is the cause of the recognition of the difference; the causal relation between the two being recognised by a concomitance and non-concomitance (mutual exclusion), the difference not being cognised even when the thing is present, without a cognition of its absent contrary.
tasmānna bhedapratyakṣaṃ suprasaramiti cet|	The perception of difference, therefore (the opponent concludes), is not easily admissible.
kiṃ vastusvarūpabhedavādinaṃ prati imāni dūṣaṇāni uddhuṣya nte, kiṃ vā dharmabhedavādinaṃ prati ? prathame corāparādhānmāṇḍavyanigraha- nyāyāpātaḥ|	To this let the reply be as follows:—Are these objections proclaimed against one who maintains a difference identical with the things themselves, or against one who maintains a difference between things as the subjects of attributes? In the former case, you will be, as the saying runs, punishing a respectable Brāhman for the offence of a thief, the objections you adduce being irrelevant.
nanu vastusvarūpasyaiva bhedatve pratiyogisāpekṣatvaṃ na ghaṭate ghaṭavat| pratiyogisāpekṣa eva sarvatra bhedaḥ prathata iti cenna| prathamaṃ sarvato vilakṣaṇatayā vastusvarūpe jñāyamāne pratiyogyapekṣayā viśiṣṭavyavahāropapatteḥ| tathā hi- parimāṇaghaṭitaṃ vastusvarūpaṃ prathamamavagamyate| paścātpratiyogi viśeṣāpekṣayā hrasvaṃ dīrghamiti tadeva viśiṣya vyavahārabhājanaṃ bhavati|	If it be urged that if it is the essence of the thing that is the difference, then it will no longer require a contrary counterpart; but if difference presuppose a contrary counterpart, it will exist everywhere; this statement must be disallowed, for while the essence of a thing is first known as different from everything else, the determinate usage (name and notion) may be shown to depend upon a contrary counterpart; for example, the essence of a thing so far as constituted by its dimensions is first cognised, and afterwards it becomes the object of some determinate judgment, as long or short in relation to some particular counterpart (or contrasted object).
taduktaṃ viṣṇutattvanirṇaye- 'na ca viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyatayā bhedasiddhiḥ| viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāvaśca bhedāpekṣaḥ| dharmipratiyogyapekṣayā bhedasiddhiḥ| bhedāpekṣaṃ ca dharmipratiyogitvamityanyonyāśrayatayā bhedasyāyuktiḥ|	Accordingly, it is said in the Viṣṇu-tattva-nirṇaya: "Difference is not proved to exist by the relation of determinant and determinate; for this relation of determinant and determinate (or predicate and subject) presupposes difference; and if difference were proved to depend upon the thing and its counterpart, and the thing and its counterpart to presuppose difference, difference as involving a logical circle could not be accounted for; but difference is itself a real predicament (or ultimate entity).
padārthasvarūpatvādbhedasya'- ityādinā| ata eva gavārthino gavayadarśanānna pravartante, go śabdaṃ ca na smaranti|	For this reason (viz., because difference is a thing) it is that men in quest of a cow do not act (as if they had found her) when they see a gayal, and do not recall the word cow.
na ca nīrakṣīrādau svarūpe gṛhyamāṇe bhedapratibhāso'pi syāditi bhaṇanīyam| samānābhihārādipratibandhakabalād bhedabhānavyavahārābhāvopapattiḥ| taduktam - atidūrātsāmīpyādindriyaghātānmano'navasthānāt|	Nor let it be objected that (if difference be a real entity and as such perceived) on seeing a mixture of milk and water, there would be a presentation of difference; for the absence of any manifestation of, and judgment about, the difference, may be accounted for by the force of (the same) obstructives (as hinder the perception of other things), viz., aggregation of similars and the rest." Thus it has been said (in the Sāṅkhya-kārikā, v.
saukṣmyād vyavadhānādabhibhavātsamānā- bhihārācca||	"From subtilty, from interposition, from being overpowered, and from aggregation of similars."

bhavatu vā dharmabhedavādastathāpi na kaściddoṣaḥ| dharmipratiyogigrahaṇe sati paścāttaddhaṭitabhedagrahaṇopapatteḥ|	Or let the hypothesis of difference in qualities be granted, and no harm is done; for given the apprehension of a subject of attributes and of its contrary, the presentation of difference in their modes is possible.
na ca parasparāśrayaprasaṅgaḥ| parānanapekṣya prabhedaśālino vastuno grahaṇe sati dharmabhedabhānasaṃbhavāt| na ca dharmabhedavāde tasya tasya bhedasya bhedāntarabhedyatvenānavasthā duravasthā syādityāstheyam|	Nor let it be supposed that on the hypothesis of difference in the modes of things, as each difference must be different from some ulterior difference, there will result an embarrassing progression to infinity, there being no occasion for the occurrence of the said ulterior difference, inasmuch as we do not observe that men think and say that two things are different as differenced from the different.
bhedabhedinau bhinnāviti vyavahārādarśanāt| na caikabhedabalenānyabhedānumānam| dṛṣṭāntabhedāvighātenotthāne doṣābhāvāt|	Nor can an ulterior difference be inferred from the first difference, for there being no difference to serve as the example in such inference, there cannot but be a non-occurrence of inference.
so'yaṃ piṇyākayācanārthaṃ gatasya khārikātaila- dātṛtvābhyupagama iva|	And thus it must be allowed that in raising the objection you have begged for a little oil-cake, and have had to give us gallons of oil.
dṛṣṭāntabhedavimarde tvanutthānameva|	If there be no difference for the example the inference cannot emerge.
na hi varavighātāya kanyodvāhaḥ|	The bride is not married for the destruction of the bridegroom.
tasmānmūlakṣayābhāvādanavasthā na doṣāya|	There being, then, no fundamental difficulty, this infinite progression presents no trouble.
anumānenāpi bhedo'vasīyate|	Difference (duality) is also ascertained by inference.
parameśvaro jīvād bhinnaḥ| taṃ prati sevyatvāt| yo yaṃ prati sevyaḥ sa tasmād bhinnaḥ| yathā bhṛtyādrājā|	Thus the Supreme Lord differs from the individual soul as the object of its obedience; and he who is to be obeyed by any person differs from that person, a king, for instance, from his attendant.
na hi sukhaṃ me syād duḥkhaṃ me na manāgapi- iti puruṣārthamarthayamānāḥ puruṣāḥ sthapatipadaṃ kāmayamānāḥ satkārabhājo bhaveyuḥ| pratyuta sarvānarthabhājanaṃ bhavanti|	For men, desiring as they do the end of man, Let me have pleasure, let me not have the slightest pain, if they covet the position of their lord, do not become objects of his favour, nay, rather, they become recipients of all kinds of evil.
yaḥ svasyātmano hīnatvaṃ parasya guṇotkarṣaṃ ca kayayati sa stutyaḥ prītaḥ stāvakasya tasyābhīṣṭaṃ prayacchati|	He who asserts his own inferiority and the excellence of his superior, he it is who is to be commended; and the gratified superior grants his eulogist his desire.
tadāha - ghātayanti hi rājāno rājāhamiti vādinaḥ|	Therefore it has been said:— "Kings destroy those who assert themselves to be kings,
dadatyakhilamiṣṭaṃ ca svaguṇotkarṣavādinām||	"And grant to those who proclaim their kingly pre-eminence all that they desire."
evaṃ ca parameśvarābhedatṛṣṇayā viṣṇorguṇotkarṣasya mṛgatṛṣṇikāsamatvābhidhānaṃ vipulakadalīphala- lipsayā jihvācche danamanuharati| etādṛśaviṣṇuvidveṣaṇādandhatamasapraveśaprasaṅgāt|	Thus the statement of those (Advaita-vādins) in their thirst to be one with the Supreme Lord, that the supreme excellence of Viṣṇu is like a mirage, is as if they were to cut off their tongues in trying to get a fine plantain, since it results that through offending this supreme Viṣṇu they must enter into the hell of blind darkness (andha-tamasa).
tadetatpratipāditaṃ madhyamandireṇa mahābhāratatātparyanirṇaye- anādidveṣiṇo daityā viṣṇau dveṣo vivardhitaḥ|	The same thing is laid down by Madhya-mandira in the Mahābhārata-tātparya-nirṇaya:— "O Daityas, enemies of the eternal, Viṣṇu's anger is waxed great;
tamasyandhe pātayati daityānante viniścayāt|| (ma.bhā.tā.1/111) iti|	"He hurls the Daityas into the blind darkness, because they decide blindly."
sā ca sevā aṅkana-nāmakaraṇa-bhajanabhedāt trividhā|	This service (or obedience of which we have spoken) is trichotomised into (1.) stigmatisation, (2.) imposition of names, (3.) worship.
tatrāṅkanaṃ nārāyaṇāyudhādīnāṃ tadrapasmaraṇārthamapekṣitārthasiddhūyarthaṃ ca|	Of these, (1.) stigmatisation is (the branding upon oneself) of the weapons of Nārāyaṇa (or Viṣṇu) as a memorial of him, and as a means of attaining the end which is needful (emancipation).
tathā ca śākalyasaṃhitāpariśiṣṭam - cakraṃ bibhartti puruṣo'bhitaptaṃ balaṃ devānāmamṛtasya viṣṇoḥ|	Thus the sequel of the Sākalya-samhitā:— "The man who bears branded in him the discus of the immortal Viṣṇu, which is the might of the gods,
sa yāti nākaṃ duritābadhūya viśanti yadyatayo vītarāgāḥ|	"He, shaking off his guilt, goes to the heaven (Vaikuṇṭha) which ascetics, whose desires are passed away, enter into:
devāso yena vidhṛtena bāhunā sudarśanena prayātāstamāyan|	"The discus Sudarśana by which, uplifted in his arm, the gods entered that heaven;
yenāṅkitā manavo lokasṛṣṭiṃ vitanvanti brāhmaṇāstadvahanti||	"Marked wherewith the Manus projected the emanation of the world, that weapon Brāhmans wear (stamped upon them);
tadviṣṇoḥ paramaṃ padaṃ yena gacchanti lāñchitāḥ|	"Stigmatised wherewith they go to the supreme sphere of Viṣṇu;
urukramasya cihnairaṅkitā loke subhagā bhavāmaḥ||iti|	"Marked with the stigmas of the wide-striding (Viṣṇu), let us become beatified."
'ataptatanūrna tadāmo aśnute śritāsa idvahantastatsamāsata' (tai.ā.1/11) iti taittirīyakopaniṣacca|	Again, the Taittirīyaka Upaniṣad says: "He whose body is not branded, is raw, and tastes it not: votaries bearing it attain thereto." The particular parts to be branded are specified in the Āgneya-purāṇa:—
sthānaviśeṣaścāgneyapurāṇe pradarśitaḥ - dakṣiṇe tu kare vipro bibhṛyācca sudarśanam|	"On his right hand let the Brāhman wear Sudarśana,
savyena śaṅkhaṃ bibhṛyāditi brahmavido viduḥ ||	"On his left the conch-shell: thus have those who know the Veda declared."
anyatra cakradhāraṇe mantraviśeṣaśca darśitaḥ - sudarśana mahājvāla koṭisūryasamaprabhaḥ ! ajñānāndhasya me nityaṃ viṣṇomārgaṃ pradarśaya||	In another passage is given the invocation to be recited on being branded with the discus:— "Sudarśana, brightly blazing, effulgent as ten million suns, "Show unto me, blind with ignorance, the everlasting way of Viṣṇu.
tvaṃ purā sāgarotpanno viṣṇunā vidhṛtaḥ kare|	"Thou aforetime sprangest from the sea, brandished in the hand of Viṣṇu,
namitaḥ sarvadevaiśca pāñcajanya namo'stu te||	"Adored by all the gods; O Pāṅcajanya, to thee be adoration."
nāmakaraṇaṃ putrādīnāṃ ke śavādināmnā vyavahāraḥ, sarvadā tannāmānusmaraṇārtham|	(2.) Imposition of names is the appellation of sons and others by such names as Keśava, as a continual memorial of the name of the Supreme Lord.
bhajanaṃ daśavidhaṃ- vācā satyaṃ hitaṃ priyaṃ svādhyāyaḥ, kāyena dānaṃ paritrāṇaṃ parirakṣaṇaṃ, manasā dayā spṛhā śraddhā ceti|	(3.) Worship is of ten kinds, viz., with the voice, (1.) veracity, (2.) usefulness, (3.) kindliness, (4.) sacred study; with the body, (5.) alms-giving, (6.) defence, (7.) protection; with the common sensory, (8.) mercy, (9.) longing, and (10.) faith.
atraikai kaṃ niṣpādya nārāyaṇe samarpaṇaṃ bhajanam|	Worship is the dedication to Nārāyaṇa of each of these as it is realised.
taduktam|	Thus it has been said:—
aṅkanaṃ nāmakaraṇaṃ bhajanaṃ daśadhā ca tat|	"Stigmatisation, imposition of names, worship; the last is of ten kinds."
evaṃ jñeyatvādināpi bhedo'numātavyaḥ| tathā śrutyāpi bhedo'vagantavyaḥ|	Difference (or duality between the Supreme Being and the universe) may also be inferred from cognisability and other marks.
'satyamenamanu viśve madanti, rātiṃ devasya gṛhṇato maghonaḥ|' satyaḥ so asya mahimā gṛṇe śavo, yajñeṣu viprarājye|' 'satya ātmā, satyo jīvaḥ, satyaṃ bhidā satyaṃ bhidā satyaṃ bhidā, maivāruvaṇyo maivāruvaṇya maivāruvaṇya' iti mokṣānandabhedapratipādaka śrutibhyaḥ|	So also difference (or duality) may be understood from revelation, from texts setting out duality in emancipation and beatitude, such as: "All rejoice over truth attained; truthful, and celebrating the gift of the divine Indra, they recount his glory;" "Sarva, among those that know the truth, O Brāhman, is in the universe, true spirit; true is individual spirit; truth is duality, truth is duality, in me is illusion, in me illusion, in me illusion."
idaṃ jñānamupāśritya mama sādharmyamāgatāḥ|	"After attaining this knowledge, becoming like unto me,
sarge'pi nopajāyante pralaye na vyathanti ca||	"In creation they are not born again, in retractation they perish not" (Bhagavad-gītā, xiv.
(gī.14/2) 'jagadvyāpāravarjam' ' prakaraṇādasaṃnihitatvācca' (bra.sū.4/4/17-18) ityādibhyaśca|	According also to such aphorisms as, "Excepting cosmical operation because of occasion, and because of non-proximity."
na ca 'brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati' (mu.3/2/9) iti śrutibalājjīvasya pāramaiśvaryaṃ śakyaśaṅkam| 'saṃpūjya brāhmaṇaṃ bhakatyā śūdro'pi brāhmaṇo bhavet'- itivad vṛṃhito bhavatītyarthaparatvāt|	Nor should suggestion be made that individual spirit is God in virtue of the text, He that knows the absolute becomes the absolute; for this text is hyperbolically eulogistic, like the text, Worshipping a Brāhman devoutly a Śūdra becomes a Brāhman, i.e., becomes exalted.
nanu- prapañco yadi vidyeta nivarteta na saṃśayaḥ|	"If the universe existed it would doubtless come to an end,"

māyāmātratvāt| māyeti bhagavadicchocyate|	Illusion is defined to be the will of the Lord, in virtue of the testimony of many such passages as:—
mahāmāyetyavidyeti niyatirmoṃhinīti ca|	"The great illusion, ignorance, necessity, the bewilderment,
prakṛtirvāsanetyeva tavecchānanta kathyate||	"The originant, ideation,—thus is thy will called, O Infinite.
prakṛtiḥ prakṛṣṭakaraṇādvāsanā vāsayedyataḥ|	"The originant, because it originates greatly; ideation, because it produces ideas;
a ityukto haristasya māyāvidyeti saṃjñinā||	"The illusion of Hari, who is called a, is termed (avidyā) ignorance:
māyetyuktā prakṛṣṭatvātprakṛṣṭe hi mayābhidhā|	"Styled (māyā) illusion, because it is pre-eminent, for the name māyā is used of the pre-eminent;
viṣṇoḥ prajñaptirevaikā śabderetairudīryate||	"The excellent knowledge of Viṣṇu is called, though one only, by these names;
prajñāptirūpo hi hariḥ sā ca svānandalakṣaṇā|	"For Hari is excellent knowledge, and this is characterised by spontaneous beatitude."
saiva prajñā mānatrāṇakartrī ca yasya tanmāyāmātram| tataśca parameśvareṇa jñānatvādrakṣitatvācca na dvaitaṃ bhrāntikalpitam|	That in which this excellent knowledge produces knowledge and effects sustentation thereof, that is pure illusion, as known and sustained, therefore by the Supreme Lord duality is not illusorily imagined.
na hīśvare sarvasya bhrāntiḥ saṃbhavati| viśeṣadarśananibandhanatvād bhrānteḥ|	For in the Lord illusory imagination of the universe is not possible, illusory imagination arising from non-perception of differences (which as an imperfection is inconsistent with the divine nature).
tarhi tadvyapadeśaḥ kathamityatrottaramadvaitaṃ paramārthata iti| paramārthata iti paramārthāpekṣayā| tena sarvasmāduttamasya viṣṇutattvasya samabhyadhikaśūnyatvamuktaṃ bhavati|	If it be asked how then that (illusory duality) is predicated, the answer is that in reality there is a non-duality, that is in reality, Viṣṇu being better than all else, has no equal and no superior.
tathā ca paramā śrutiḥ - jīveśvarabhidā caiva jaḍeśvarabhidā tathā|	Accordingly, the grand revelation:— "A difference between soul and the Lord, a difference between the unsentient and the Lord,
jīvabhedo mithaścaiva jaḍajīvabhidā tathā|| mithaśca jaḍabhedo yaḥ prapañco bhedapañcakaḥ|	"A difference among souls, and a difference of the unsentient and the soul each from the other. "Also the difference of unsentient things from one another, the world with its five divisions.
so'yaṃ satyo'pyanādiśca sādiścennāśamāpnuyāt||	"This same is real and from all eternity; if it had had a beginning it would have an end:
na ca nāśaṃ prayātyeṣa na cāsau bhrāntikalpitaḥ|	"Whereas it does not come to an end; and it is not illusorily imagined:
kalpitaścennivarteta na cāsau vinivartate||	"For if it were imagined it would cease, but it never ceases.
dvaitaṃ na vidyata iti tasmādajñānināṃ matam|	"That there is no duality is therefore the doctrine of those that lack knowledge;
mataṃ hi jñānināmetanmitaṃ trātaṃ hi viṣṇunā||	"For this the doctrine of those that have knowledge is known and sustained by Viṣṇu."
tasmādviṣṇoḥ sarvoṃtkarṣa eva tātparyaṃ sarvāgamānām|	The purpose, then, of all revelations is to set out the supreme excellence of Viṣṇu.
etadevābhisaṃghāyābhihitaṃ bhagavatā - dvāvimau puruṣau loke kṣaraścākṣara eva ca|	With this in view the Lord declared:— "Two are these persons in the universe, the perishable and the imperishable;
kṣaraḥ sarvāṇi bhūtāni kū ṭastho'kṣara ucyate||	"The perishable is all the elements, the imperishable is the unmodified.
uttama puruṣastvanyaḥ paramātmetyudāhṛtaḥ|	"The other, the most excellent person, called the Supreme Spirit,
yo lokatrayamāviśya vibharttyavyaya īśvaraḥ||	"Is the undecaying Lord, who pervading sustains the three worlds.
yasmātkṣaramatīto'hamakṣarādapi cottamaḥ|	"Since transcending the perishable, I am more excellent than the imperishable (soul),
ato'smi loke vede ca prathitaḥ puruṣottamaḥ|	"Hence I am celebrated among men and in the Veda as the best of persons (Puruṣottama);
yo māmevamasaṃmūḍho jānāti puruṣottamam| sa sarvavidbhajati māṃ sarvabhāvena bhārata||	"He who uninfatuated knows me thus the best of persons, he all-knowing worships me in every wise.
iti guhyatamaṃ śāstramidamuktaṃ mayānagha|	"Thus this most mysterious institute is declared, blameless (Arjuna):
etad buddhvā buddhimānsyātkṛtakṛtyaśca bhārata||	"Knowing this a man may be wise, and may have done what he has to do, O Bhārata" (Bhagavad-gītā, xv.
(gī.15/16-20) iti|	So in the Mahā-varāha—
mahāvarāhe'pi - mukhyaṃ ca sarvavedānāṃ tātparyaṃ nīpatau pare|	"The primary purport of all the Vedas relates to the supreme spouse of Śrī;
utkarṣe tu tadanyatra tātparyaṃ syādavāntarama||iti|	"Its purport regarding the excellence of any other deity must be subordinate."
yuktaṃ ca viṣṇoḥ sarvoṃtkarṣe mahātātparyam|	It is reasonable that the primary purport should regard the supreme excellence of Viṣṇu.
mokṣo hi sarvapuruṣārthoṃttamaḥ| dharmārthakāmāḥ sarve'pi na nityā mokṣa eva hi| nityastasmāttadarthāya yateta matimānnaraḥ| iti bhāllaveyaśruteḥ|	For emancipation is the highest end of all men, according to the text of the Bhāllaveya Upaniṣad: While merit, wealth, and enjoyment are transitory, emancipation is eternal; therefore a wise man should strive unceasingly to attain thereto.
mokṣaśca viṣṇuprasādamantareṇa na labhyate| yasya prasādātpararmāttirūpādasmātsaṃsāranmucyate nāpareṇa| nārāyaṇo'sau paramo vicintyo mumukṣubhiḥ karmapāśādamuṣmāt|| iti nārāyaṇaśruteḥ|	And emancipation is not won without the grace of Viṣṇu, according to the text of the Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad: Through whose grace is the highest state, through whose essence he is liberated from transmigration, while inferior men propitiating the divinities are not emancipated; the supreme object of discernment to those who desire to be liberated from this snare of works. According also to the words of the Viṣṇu-purāṇa—
tasminprasanne kimihāstyalabhyaṃ dharmārthakāmairalamalpakāste|	"If he be propitiated, what may not here be won? Enough of all wealth and enjoyments.
samāśritād brahmataroranantāt niḥsaṃśayaṃ yuktiphalaṃ prayānti||	On climbing the tree of the supreme essence, without doubt a man attains to the fruit of emancipation."
(vi.pu.1/17/61) iti viṣṇupurāṇokte śca| prasādaśca guṇotkarṣajñānādeva nābhedajñānādityuktam|	And it is declared that the grace of Viṣṇu is won only through the knowledge of his excellence, not through the knowledge of non-duality.
na ca tattvamasyāditādātmyavyākopaḥ| śrutitātparyāparijñānavijṛmbhaṇāt|	Nor is there in this doctrine any confliction with texts declaratory of the identity (of personal and impersonal spirit) such as, That art thou (for this pretended identity) is mere babbling from ignorance of the real purport.
āha nityaparokṣaṃ tu tvacchabdo hyaviśeṣataḥ|	"The word That, when undetermined, designates the eternally unknown,
tvaṃśabdaścāparokṣārthaṃ tayoraikyaṃ kathaṃ bhavet||	"The word Thou designates a knowable entity; how can these be one?"
ādityo yūpa itivatsādṛśyārthā tu sā śrutiḥ|	And this text (That art thou) indicates similarity (not identity) like the text, The sun is the sacrificial post.
tathā ca paramā śrutiḥ - jīvasya paramaikyaṃ tu buddhisārupyameva tu|	Thus the grand revelation:— "The ultimate unity of the individual soul is either similarity of cognition,
ekasthānaniveśo vā vyaktisthānamapekṣya saḥ||	"Or entrance into the same place, or in relation to the place of the individual;
na svarūpaikatā tasya yuktasyāpi virupataḥ|	"Not essential unity, for even when it is emancipated it is different,
svātantryapūrṇate'lpatvapāratantrye virupate||	"The difference being independence and completeness (in the Supreme Spirit), and smallness and dependence (in the individual spirit)."
athavā tattvamasītyatra sa evātmā svātantryādiguṇopetatvāt| atattvamasi tvaṃ tatra bhavasi tadrahitatvādityekatvamatiśayena nirākṛtam|	Or to propose another explanation of the text, Ātmā tat tvam asi, That art thou, it may be divided, ātmā tat tvam asi. He alone is soul as possessing independence and other attributes, and thou art not-that (atat) as wanting those attributes; and thus the doctrine of unity is utterly expelled.
tadāha- atatvamiti vā che dastenaikyaṃ sunirākṛtam|	"Or the division may be Atat tvam, and thus unity will be well got rid of."

tathā ca mahopaniṣad- yathā pakṣī ca sūtraṃ ca nānāvṛkṣarasā yathā|	Accordingly the Mahopaniṣad:— "Like a bird and the string; like the juices of various trees;
yathā nadyaḥ samudrāśca yathā jīvamahīruhau||	"Like rivers and the sea; like fresh and salt water;
corāpahāryau ca yathā yathā puṃviṣayāvapi||	"Like a robber and the robbed; like a man and his energy;
tathā jīveśvarau bhinnau sarvadaiva vilakṣaṇau|| tathāpi sūkṣmarūpatvānna jīvātparamo hariḥ|	"So are soul and the Lord diverse, for ever different. "Nevertheless from subtilty (or imperceptibility) of form, the supreme Hari
bhedena mandadṛṣṭīnāṃ dṛśyate prerako'pi san||	"Is not seen by the dim-sighted to be other than the individual spirit, though he is its actuator;
vailakṣaṇyaṃ tayojñātvā mucyate badhyate'nyathā|iti|	"On knowing their diversity a man is emancipated: otherwise he is bound."
brahmā śivaḥ surādyāśca śarīrakṣaraṇatkṣarāḥ|	"Brahmā, Śiva, and the greatest of the gods decay with the decay of their bodies;
lakṣmīrakṣaradehatvādakṣarā tatparo hariḥ||	"Greater than these is Hari, undecaying, because his body is for the sustentation of Lakṣmī.

muktānāṃ cāśrayo viṣṇuradhiko'dhipatistathā|	"Viṣṇu is the refuge of liberated souls, and their supreme ruler.
tadvaśā eva te sarve sarvadaiva sa īśvaraḥ|| iti ca|	"Obedient to him are they for ever; he is the Lord."
ekavijñānena sarvavijñānaṃ ca pradhānatvakāraṇatvādinā yujyate na tu sarva mithyātvena|	That by knowledge of one thing there is knowledge of all things may be evinced from its supremacy and causality, not from the falsity of all things.
na hi satyajñānena mithyājñānaṃ saṃbhavati|	For knowledge of the false cannot be brought about by knowledge of real existence.
yathā pradhānapuruṣāṇāṃ jñānājñānābhyāṃ grāmo jñāto'jñāta ityevamādivyapadeśo dṛṣṭa eva| yathā ca kāraṇe pitari jñāte jānātyasya putramiti| yathā vā sādṛśyādekastrījñānād anyastrījñānamiti|	As we see the current assurance and expression that by knowing or not knowing its chief men a village is known or not known; and as when the father the cause is known, a man knows the son; (so by knowing the supreme and the cause, the inferior and the effect is known).
anyathā 'somyaike na mṛtpiṇḍena sarvaṃ mṛnmayaṃ vijñātam' ityatra eka- piṇḍaśabdau vṛthā prasajyeyātām| mṛdā vijñātayā' ityetāvataiva vākyasya pūrṇatvāt|	Otherwise (on the doctrine of the Advaita-vādins that the world is false and illusory) the words one and lump in the text, By one lump of clay, fair sir, all that is made of clay is recognised, would be used to no purpose, for the text must be completed by supplying the words, By reason of clay recognised.
na ca 'vācārambhaṇaṃ vikāro nāmadheyaṃ mṛttike tyeva satyam' (chā.6/1/5) ityetatkāryasya mithyātvamācaṣṭaṃ ityeṣṭavyam| vācārambhaṇaṃ vikāro yasya tadavikṛtaṃ nityaṃ nāmadheyaṃ mṛttike tyādikamityetadvacanaṃ satyamityarthasya svīkārāt|	For the text, Utterance with the voice, modification, name, clay (or other determinate object),—these alone are real, cannot be assumed to impart the falsity of things made; the reality of these being admitted, for what is meant is, that of which utterance with the voice is a modification, is unmodified, eternal; and a name such as clay, such speech is true.
aparathā nāmadheyamitiśabdayorvaiyarthya prasajyeta|	Otherwise it would result that the words name and alone would be otiose.
ato na ku trāpi jagato mithyātvasiddhiḥ|	There is no proof anywhere, then, that the world is unreal.
kiṃ ca prapañco mithyetyatra mithyātvaṃ tathyamatathyaṃ vā prathame satyādvaitabhaṅga prasaṅgaḥ|	Besides (we would ask) is the statement that the world is false itself true or false. If the statement is true, there is a violation of a real non-duality.
carame prapañcasatyatvāpātaḥ|	If the statement is untrue, it follows that the world is true.
nanvanityaṃtvaṃ nityamanityaṃ vā| ubhayathāpyanupapattirityākṣepavadayamapi nityasama jātibhedaḥ syāt|	Perhaps it may be objected that this dilemma is a kind of fallacious reasoning, like the dilemma: Is transitoriness permanent or transitory? There is a difficulty in either case.
taduktaṃ nyāyanirmāṇavedhasānityamanityabhāvādanitye nityatvopapatternityasamaḥ' (nyā0sū05/3/35) iti|	As it is said by the author of the Nyāya-nirvāṇa: The proof of the permanence of the transitory, as being both permanent and transitory, is a paralogism.
tārki karakṣāyāṃ ca - dharmasya tadūtadrapavikalpānupapattitaḥ|	And in the Tārkika-rakṣā— "When a mode cannot be evinced to be either such and such, or not such and such,
dharmiṇastadviśiṣṭatvabhaṅgo nityasamo bhaveta||iti|	"The denial of a subject characterised by such a mode is called Nitya-sama."
asyāḥ saṃjñāyā upalakṣaṇatvamabhipretyābhihitaṃ pravodhasiddhāvanvarthitvāttūparañjakadharmasameti|	With the implied mention of this same technical expression it is stated in the Prabodha-siddhi: Equality of characteristic modes results from significancy.
tasmādasaduttaramiti cet - aśikṣitatrāsanametat| duṣṭatvamūlānirūpaṇāt|	If it be said, This then is a valid rejoinder, we reply, This is a mere scaring of the uninstructed, for the source of fallacy has not been pointed out.
tad dvividhaṃ sādhāraṇamasādhāraṇaṃ ca| tatrādyaṃ svavyāghātakam| dvitīyaṃ tribidhaṃ yuktāṅgahīnatvamayuktāṅgādhikatvamaviṣayavṛttitvaṃ ceti|	This is twofold, general and particular: of these, the former is self-destructive, and the latter is of three kinds, defect of a requisite element, excess of an element not requisite, and residence in that which is not the subjicible subject.
tatra sādhāraṇamasaṃbhavitameva| uktasyākṣepasya svātmavyāpanānulambhāt| evamasādhāraṇamapi| ghaṭasya nāstitāyāṃ nāstitoktau astitvavatprakṛte'pyupapatteḥ|	Of these (two forms of the fallacy), the general form is not suspected, no self-pervasion being observed in the dilemma in question (viz., Is the statement that the world is unreal itself true or false? &c.) So likewise the particular; for if a water-jar be said to be non-existent, the affirmation of its non-existence is equally applicable to the water-jar as that of its existence.
nanu prapañcasya mithyātvamabhyupeyate nāsattvamiti cet, tadetatso'yaṃ śiraśche de'pi śataṃ na dadāti, viṃśatipañcakaṃ tu prayacchatīti śākaṭikavṛttāntamanuharet| mithyātvāsattvayoḥ paryāyatvādi- tyalamatiprapañcena|	If you reply: We accept the unreality (or falsity) of the world, not its non-existence; this reply is about as wise as the procedure of the carter who will lose his head rather than pay a hundred pieces of money, but will at once give five score; for falsity and non-existence are synonymous. We dismiss further prolixity.
tatra 'athāto brahmajijñāsā' (bra0sū01/1/1) iti prathamasūtrasyāyamarthaḥ| tatrāthaśabdo maṅgalārthoṃ'dhikārānantaryārthaśca svīkriyate|	The meaning of the first aphorism, viz., Then hence the absolute is to be desired to be known, is as follows:—The word then is allowed to purport auspiciousness, and to designate subsequency to the qualification (of the aspirant).
ataḥśabdo hetvarthaḥ|	The word hence indicates a reason.
taduktaṃ gāruḍe- athātaḥśabdapūrvāṇi sūtrāṇi nikhilānyapi|	Accordingly it is stated in the Gāruḍa-purāṇa:—
prārabhyante niyatyaiva tatkimatra niyāmakam|| kaścārthastu tayorvidvankathamuttamatā tayoḥ|	"All the aphorisms begin with the words Then and Hence regularly; what then is the reason of this? "And what is the sense of those words, O sage? Why are those the most excellent?
etadākhyāhi me brahmanyathā jñāsyāmi tattvataḥ||	"Tell me this, Brahmā, that I may know it truly."
evamukto nāradena brahmā provāca sattamaḥ|	Thus addressed by Nārada, the most excellent Brahmā replied:—
ānantaryādhikāre ca maṅgalārthe tathaiva ca||	"The word Then is used of subsequency and of competency, and in an auspicious sense,
athaśabdastvataḥśabdo hetvarthe samudīritaḥ|	"And the word Thence is employed to indicate the reason."
yato nārāyaṇaprasādamantareṇa na mokṣo labhyate prasādaśca jñānamantareṇa, ato brahmajijñāsā kartavyeti siddham|	It is laid down that we must institute inquiries about the absolute, because emancipation is not attained without the grace of Nārāyana, and his grace is not attained without knowledge.
jijñāsyabrahmaṇo lakṣaṇamuktaṃ 'janmādyasya yataḥ' (bra.sū.1.1.2) iti| sṛṣṭisthityādi yato bhavati tad brahmeti vākyārthaḥ| tathā ca skāndaṃ vacaḥ - utpattisthitisaṃhārā niyatirjñānamāvṛtiḥ|	The absolute, about which the inquiry is to be instituted, is described in the words (of the second aphorism): From which the genesis, and so forth, of this. The meaning of the sentence is that the absolute is that from which result emanation, sustentation, and retractation; according to the words of the Skanda-purāṇa—
vandhamokṣau ca puruṣādyasmātsa harirekarāṭ||	"He is Hari the sole ruler, the spirit from whom are emanation, sustentation, retractation, necessity, knowledge, involution (in illusion), and bondage and liberation;"
yato vā imānītyādiśrutibhyaśca|	and according to such Vedic texts, From which are these.
tatra pramāṇamapyuktaṃ 'śāstrayonitvāt' (bra0sū01/1/3) iti|	The evidence adducible for this is described (in the third aphorism): Because it has its source from the system.
'nāvedavinmanute taṃ bṛhantam' (tai0brā0 3/12/9/7) 'taṃ tvaupaniṣadam' (bṛ0 3/9/26) ityādiśrutibhyastasyānumānikatvaṃ nirākriyate|	That the absolute should be reached by way of inference is rejected by such texts as, He that knows not the Veda cogitates not that mighty one; Him described in the Upaniṣads.
ca cānumānasya svātantryeṇa prāmāṇyamasti| taduktaṃ kaurme - śrutisāhāyyarahitamanumānaṃ na ku tracit|	Inference, moreover, is not by itself authoritative, as is said in the Kaurma-purāṇa— "Inference, unaccompanied by revelation, in no case
niścayātsādhayedarthaṃ pramāṇāntarameva ca||	"Can definitely prove a matter, nor can any other form of evidence;
śrutismṛtisahāyaṃ yatpramāṇantaramuttamam|	"Whatsoever other form of evidence, companioned by revelation and tradition,
pramāṇapadavīṃ gacchennātra kāryā vicāraṇā||	"Acquires the rank of probation, about this there can be no hesitation."
śāstrasvarupamuktaṃ skānde - ṛgyajuḥsāmātharvā ca bhārataṃ pāñcarātrakam| mūlarāmāyaṇaṃ caiva śāstramityabhidhīyate||	What a Śāstra (or system of sacred institutes) is, has been stated in the Skanda-purāṇa:— "The Rig-veda, the Yajur-veda, the Sāma-veda, the Atharva-veda, the Mahābhārata, the Pañca-rātra, and the original Rāmāyaṇa, are called Śāstras.
yaccānukū lametasya tacca śāstraṃ prakīrtitam|	"That also which is conformable to these is called Śāstra.

tasmānna bhedānuvādakatvamiti tatparatvamavagamyate| ata evoktam - sadāgamaikavijñeyaṃ matītakṣarākṣaram|	Therefore there can be in these texts no mere explanation of such duality, and the texts must be understood to indicate the duality. Hence it is that it has said:—
nārāyaṇaṃ sadā vande nirdoṃṣāśeṣasadguṇam|| (vi.ta.1) iti|	"I ever laud Nārāyaṇa, the one being to be known from genuine revelation, who transcends the perishable and the imperishable, without imperfections, and of inexhaustible excellences."
śāstrasya tatra prāmāṇyamupapāditaṃ 'tattu samanvayāt' (bra0sū01/1/4) iti|	It has thus been evinced that the sacred institutes are the evidence of (the existence of) this (ultimate reality, Brahman).
samanvaya upakramādilaṅgam|	(The fourth aphorism is): But that is from the construction.
uktaṃ ca bṛhatsaṃhitāyām - upakramopasaṃhārāvabhyāso'pūrvatā phalam| arthavādopapattī ca liṅgaṃ tātparyanirṇaye||iti|	In regard to this, the commencement and other elements are stated to be the marks of the construction, in the Bṛhat-saṃhitā:— "Commencement, conclusion, reiteration, novelty, profit, eulogy, and demonstration, are the marks by which the purport is ascertained."
evaṃ vedāntatātparyavaśāt tadeva brahma śāstragamyamityuktaṃ bhavati|	It is thus stated that in accordance with the purport of the Upaniṣads the absolute is to be apprehended only from the sacred institutes.

They, on the contrary, hold the opinion that "the Supreme Being is a cause in dependence on our actions, &c.;" and they maintain that there are three categories distinguished as the Lord, the soul, and the world (or literally "the master," "the cattle," and "the fetter").
yaduktasādhanaṃ taduktasādhyaṃ yathārthādi|	As has been said by those well versed in the Tantra doctrines—
yathoktaṃ siddhagurubhiḥ - svatantrasyāprayojyatvaṃ karaṇādiprayoktṛtā| kartuḥ svātantryametaddhi na karmādyanapekṣatā||iti|| tathā ca tattatkarmāśayavaśād bhoga-tatsādhana-tadupādānādi-viśeṣajñaḥ kartānumānādisiddha iti siddham| tadidamuktaṃ tatrabhavadbhirbṛhaspatibhiḥ - iha bhogyabhogasādhanatadupādānādi yo vijānāti|	Nor may we say with the Vedāntin that it is only one, since the apportionment of different fruits proves that there are many individual souls; nor with the Sānkhyas that it is devoid of action, since, when all the various "fetters" are removed, Śruti informs us of a state of identity with Śiva, which consists in intelligence in the form of an eternal and infinite vision and action.[21] This has been declared in the Śrīmat Mṛgendra—
kleśayukto'sarvajñaḥ parimitaśaktiṃ prāpnuyāditi cet- maivaṃ maṃsthā|	"It is revealed that identity with Śiva results when all fetters are removed."
anyatrāpi- tadvapuḥ pañcabhirmantraiḥ pañcakṛtyopayogibhiḥ|	And again— "Intelligence consists in vision and action, and since in his soul
taduktaṃ śrīmatkaraṇe - śuddhe'dhvani śivaḥ kartā prokto'nantohite prabhoḥ||	"This exists always and on every side, therefore, after liberation, Śruti calls it that which faces every way."
nāpi sāṃkhyānāmivākartā|	It is also said in the Tattva-prakāśa—
tattvaprakāśe'pi - muktātmāno'pi śivāḥ kiṃ tvete yatprasādato muktāḥ|	"The liberated souls are themselves Śivas, but these are liberated by his favour;
so'nādimukta eko vijñeyaḥ pañcamantratanuḥ|	"He is to be known as the one eternally liberated, whose body is the five Mantras."

The first are those who are under the influence of mala only, since their actions are cancelled by receiving their proper fruits, or by abstraction, contemplation, and knowledge, and since they have no "fetters" in the form of enjoyments, such as kalā, &c.
dvitīyastu pralayena kalāderupasaṃhārā- nmalakarmayuktaḥ 'pralayākala' iti vyavahriyate|	(b.) The second are those who are under the influence of mala and karman, since in their case kalā, &c., are destroyed by mundane destructions, hence their name pralayākala.
tṛtīyastu malamāyākarmātmakabandhatraya sahitaḥ 'sakala' iti saṃlapyate|	(c.) The third are those who are bound in the three fetters of mala, māyā, and karman, hence their name sakala.
tatra prathamo dviprakāro bhavati-samāptakaluṣāsamāptakaluṣabhedāt|	The first class are again subdivided into samāpta-kaluṣāḥ and asamāpta-kaluṣāḥ, according as their inherent corruption is perfectly exhausted or not.
tatrādyān kāluṣyaparipākavataḥ puruṣadhaureyānadhikārayogyān anugṛhya anantādividveśvarāṣṭapadaṃ prāpayati|	The former,—having received the mature penalties of their corruptions,—are now, as foremost of men and worthy of the privilege, raised by Śiva's favour to the rank of the Lords of Knowledge (the Vidyeśvaras), Ananta, and the rest.
tadvidyeśvarāṣṭakaṃ nirdiṣṭaṃ bahudaivatye - anantaścaiva sūkṣmaśca tathaiva ca śivottamaḥ|	This ogdoad of the Lords of Knowledge is described in the Bahudaivatya— "Ananta, and Sūkṣma, and Śivottama,

śrīkaṇṭhaśca śikhaṇḍī ca proktā vidyeśvarā ime||	"Śrīkaṇṭha and Śikhaṇḍin,—these are declared to be the Vidyeśvaras."
ādyānanugṛhya śivo vidyeśatve niyojayatyaṣṭau| mantrā~śca karotyaparā~ste coktāḥ koṭayaḥ sapta||iti||	The latter Śiva, in his mercy, raises to the rank of the seventy million Mantras.[23] All this is explained in the Tattva-prakāśa.[24] Similarly Soma-Śambhu has said—
somaśaṃbhunāpyabhihitam - vijñānākalanāmaikā dvitīyaḥ pralayākalaḥ|	"One class is named vijñānākala, the second pralayākala,
tṛtīyaḥ sakalaḥ śāstre'nugrāhyastrividho mataḥ||	"The third sakala,—these are the three whom the Śāstra regards as objects of mercy.
tatrādyo malamātreṇa yukto'nyo malakarmabhiḥ||	"The first is united to mala alone, the second to mala and karma,
kalādibhūmiparyantatattvaistu sakalo yutaḥ||	"The third are united to all the tattvas beginning with kalā and ending with 'earth.'"[25]
pralayākalo'pi dvividhaḥ- pakvapāśadvayastadvilakṣaṇaśca|	The Pralayākalāḥ are also twofold, as being pakvapāśadvaya or not, i.e., those in whom the two remaining fetters are matured, and those in whom they are not.
tatra prathamo mokṣaṃ prāpnoti| dvitīyastu puryaṣṭakayutaḥ karmavaśānnānāvidhajanmabhāgbhavati|	The former attain liberation, but the latter, by the power of karman, are endowed with the puryaṣṭaka[26] body, and pass through various births.
tadapyuktaṃ tattvaprakāśe- pralayākaleṣu yeṣāmapakvamalakarmaṇī brajantyete|	As has been said in the Tattva-prakāśa— "Those among the Pralayākalas whose karman and mala are immature,
muryaṣṭakadehayutā yoniṣu nikhilāsu karmavaśāt||	"Go, united with the puryaṣṭaka body, into many births by the power of karman."
puryaṣṭakamapi tatraiva nirdiṣṭam - syātpuryaṣṭakamantaḥkaraṇaṃ dhīkarmakaraṇāni|	The puryaṣṭaka is also thus described in the same work— "The puryaṣṭaka is composed of the internal organ, thought (dhī), karman, and the instruments."
vivṛtaṃ cāghoraśivācāryeṇapuryaṣṭakaṃ nāma pratipuruṣaṃ niyataḥ, sargādārabhya kalpāntaṃ mokṣāntaṃ vā sthitaḥ, pṛthivyādikalā- paryantastriśattattvātmakaḥ, sūkṣmo dehaḥ| tathā coktaṃ tattvasaṃgrahe - vasudhādyastattvagaṇaḥ pratipuṃniyataḥ kalānto'yam|	This is thus explained by Aghora Śiva Ācārya, "the puryaṣṭaka is a subtile body apportioned to each individual soul, which continues from the creation until the close of the kalpa, or until liberation: it is composed of the thirty[27] tattvas beginning with 'earth' and ending with kalā." As has been said in the Tattva-sangraha— "This set of tattvas, commencing with 'earth' and ending with kalā, is assigned to each soul,
paryaṭati karmavaśād bhuvanajadeheṣvayaṃ ca sarveṣu||	"And wanders by the law of karman through all the bodies produced by the world."

karaṇaśabdena jñānakarmendriyadaśakaṃ saṃgṛhyate|	By the word "instruments" are comprehended the ten organs of sense and action.
nanu śrīmatkālottare - śabdaḥ sparśastathā rūpaṃ raso gandhaśca pañcakam| buddhirmanastvahaṃkāraḥ puryaṣṭakamudāhṛtam||	"But is it not declared in the Śrīmat Kālottara that 'The set of five, sound, touch, form, taste and smell, intelligence, mind and egoism, these constitute the puryaṣṭaka?'"
tatkathamanyathā kathyate ? addhā, ata eva ca tatrabhavatā rāmakāṇḍena tatsūtraṃ triṃśatattvaparatayā vyākhyāyītyalamati- prapañcena|	How, then, can any different account be maintained? We grant this, and hence the venerable Rāma Kaṇṭha has explained that sūtra in its literal meaning [i.
tathāpi kathamasya puryaṣṭakatvam ? bhūtatanmātrabuddhīndriyakarmendriyāntaḥkaraṇasaṃjñaiḥpañcabhirvargaiḥ tatkāraṇena pradhānena kalādi- pañcakātmanā vargeṇa cārabdhatvādityavirodhaḥ|	e., as puryaṣṭaka, is derived from aṣṭa, "eight"], so why should we be prolix in the discussion? Still, if you ask how we can reconcile our account with the strict nominal definition of puryaṣṭaka, we reply that there is really no contradiction, as we maintain that it is composed of a set of eight in the following manner:—(1.) The five elements; (2.) the five rudiments; (3.) the five organs of knowledge; (4.) those of action; (5.) the fourfold internal organ; (6.) their instrument;[30] (7.) nature [prakṛti]; and (8.) the class composed of the five, beginning with kalā, which form a kind of case.[31]

sakalo'pi dvividhaḥ| pakvakaluṣāpakvakaluṣabhedāt|	The class called sakala is also divided into two, as pakvakaluṣa and apakvakaluṣa.

śatamaṣṭādaśa teṣāṃ ku rute svayameva mantreśān||	"The Supreme of his own will makes one hundred and eighteen of these the Lords of the Mantras.
tatrāṣṭau maṇḍalinaḥ krodhādyāstatsamāśca vīreśaḥ|	"Eight of these are called Maṇḍalins; eight again are Krodha, &c.;
śrīkaṇṭhaḥ śatarudrāḥ śatamityaṣṭādaśābhyadhikam||	"Vīreśa, Śrīkaṇṭha, and the hundred Rudras,—these together are the hundred and eighteen."

yojayati pare tattve sa dīkṣayā''cāryamūrtisthaḥ||	"He, assuming the form of a teacher, unites by initiation to the highest principle."
śrīmanmṛgendre'pi - pūrvaṃ vyatyāsitasyāṇoḥ pāśajālamapohati||	It is also said in the Srīmad Mṛgendra— "He removes from that infinitesimal soul all the bonds which previously exerted a contrary influence over it."[32]
vyākṛtaṃ ca nārāyaṇakaṇṭhena| tatsarvaṃ tata evāvadhāryam| asmābhistu vistarabhiyā na prastūyate|	All this has been explained at great length by Nārāyaṇa-Kaṇṭha, and there it is to be studied; but we are obliged to pass on through fear of prolixity.

asyārthaḥ- prāvṛṇoti prakarṣeṇācchādayatyātmanaḥ svābhāvikyau dṛkkriye iti prāvṛttiraśucirmalaḥ| sa ca īṣṭe svātantryeṇeti īśaḥ|	(4.) "Māyā," because herein as an energy of the Divine Being all the world is potentially contained (māti) at a mundane destruction, and again at a creation it all comes (yāti) into manifestation, hence the derivation of the name.
taduktam tāsāmahaṃ varā śaktiḥ sarvānugrāhikā śivā|	This has been said in the Śrīmat Saurabheya—
dharmānuvartanādeva pāśa ityupacaryate||(2)| kriyate phalārthibhiriti karma dharmādharmātmakaṃ bījāṅku ravatpravāharūpeṇānādi|	"The effects, as a form of the Divine energy, are absorbed therein at a mundane destruction, "And again at a renovation it is manifested anew in the form of effects as kalā, &c."[38]
(4) yadyapyatra bahu vaktavyamasti tathāpi granthabhūyastvabhayāduparamyate|	Although much more might be added on this topic, yet we stop here through fear of extending this treatise too far.
taditthaṃ pati paśupāśapadārthāstrayaḥ padarśitāḥ|	Thus have the three categories been declared,—the Lord, the soul, and matter.
patividye tathāvidyā paśuḥ pāśaśca kāraṇam|	"The Lord, knowledge, ignorance, the soul, matter, and the cause
tannivṛttāviti proktāḥ padārthāḥ ṣaṭ samāsataḥ||	"Of the cessation thereof,—these are collectively the six categories."

Thus looking upon recognition as a new method for the attainment of ends and of the highest end, available to all men alike, without any the slightest trouble and exertion, such as external and internal worship, suppression of the breath, and the like, these Māheśvaras set forth the system of recognition (pratyabhijñā).
tasyeyattāpi nyarūpi parīkṣakaiḥ - sūtraṃ vṛttirvivṛttirladhvī bṛhatītyubhe vimarśinyau|	The extent of this system is thus described by one of their authorities— "The aphorisms, the commentary, the gloss, the two explications, the greater and the less,
prakaraṇavivaraṇapañcakamiti śāstraṃ pratyabhijñāyāḥ||	"The five topics, and the expositions,—such is the system of recognition."
tatredaṃ prathamaṃ sūtram - kathaṃcidāsādya maheśvarasya dāsyaṃ janasyāpyupakāramicchan|	The first aphorism in their text-book is as follows[2]:— "Having reached somehow or other the condition of a slave of Maheśvara, and wishing also to help mankind,
samastasaṃpatsamavāptihetuṃ tatpratyabhijñāmupapādayāmi||iti||	"I set forth the recognition of Maheśvara, as the method of attaining all felicity."

tadanena viditavedyatvena parārthaśāstrakaraṇe'dhikāro darśitaḥ| anyathā pratāraṇameva prasajyeta|	Thus knowing that which has to be known, he is qualified to construct a system for others: otherwise the system would be a mere imposture.

tasya dāsyam| dīyate'smai svāminā sarvaṃ yathābhilaṣitamiti dāsaḥ| parameśvarasvarūpa- svātantryapātramityarthaḥ|	The condition of being a slave to Maheśvara is the being a recipient of that independence or absoluteness which is the essence of the divine nature, a slave being one to whom his lord grants all things according to his will and pleasure (i.e., dāsya, from dā).
janaśabdenādhikāri- viṣayaniyamābhāvaḥ prādarśi|	The word mankind imports that there is no restriction of the doctrine to previously qualified students.
yasya yasya hīdaṃ svarūpakathanaṃ tasya tasya mahāphalaṃ bhavati| prajñānasyaiva paramārthaphalatvāt|	Whoever he may be to whom this exposition of the divine nature is made, he reaps its highest reward, the emanatory principium itself operating to the highest end of the transmigrating souls.
tathopadiṣṭaṃ śivadṛṣṭau paramagurubhirbhagavatsomānandanāthapādaiḥ - ekavāraṃ pramāṇena śāstrādvā guruvākyataḥ| jñāte śivatve sarvasthe pratipatyā dṛḍhātmanā||	It has been accordingly laid down in the Śiva-dṛṣṭi by that supreme guide the revered Somānandanātha— "When once the nature of Śiva that resides in all things has been known with tenacious recognition, whether by proof or by instruction in the words of a spiritual director,
karaṇena nāsti kṛtyaṃ kvāpi bhāvanayāpi vā|	"There is no further need of doing aught, or of any further reflection.
jñāte suvarṇe karaṇaṃ bhāvānāṃ vā parityajet||	When he knows Suvarṇa (or Śiva) a man may cease to act and to reflect."
apiśabdena svātmanastadabhinnatāmāviṣku rvatā pūrṇatvena svātmani parārthasaṃpattyatirikta- prayojanāntarāvakāśaśca parākṛtaḥ| parārthaśca prayojanaṃ bhavatyeva|	The word also excludes the supposition that there is room in self which has recognised the nature of Maheśvara, and which manifests to itself its own identity with him, and is therefore fully satisfied, for any other motive than felicity for others.
tallakṣaṇayogāt| na hyayaṃ devaśāpaḥ 'svārtha eva prayojanaṃ na parārtha' iti|	The well-being of others is a motive, whatever may be said, for the definition of a motive applies to it: for there is no such divine curse laid upon man that self-regard should be his sole motive to the exclusion of a regard for others.
ata evoktamakṣapādena-'yamarthamadhikṛtya pravartate tatprayojanam' (gau0sū0 1/1/24) iti|	Thus Akṣapāda (i. 24) defines a motive: A motive is that object towards which a man energises.
upaśabdaḥ sāmīpyārthaḥ| tena janasya parameśvarasamīpatākaraṇamātraṃ phalam|	The preposition upa in upapādayami (I set forth) indicates proximity: the result is the bringing of mankind near unto God.
ata evāha - samasteti|	Hence the word all in the phrase the method of attaining all felicities.
parameśvaratālābhe hi sarvāḥ saṃpadastanniṣyandamayyaḥ saṃpannā eva, rohaṇācalalābhe ratnasaṃpada iva|	For when the nature of the Supreme Being is attained, all felicities, which are but the efflux thereof, are overtaken, as if a man acquired the mountain Rohaṇa (Adam's Peak), he would acquire all the treasures it contains.
evaṃ parameśvaratālābhe kimanyatprārthanīyam ? taduktamutpalācāryaiḥ - bhaktilakṣmīsamṛddhānāṃ kimanyadupayācitam| etayā vā daridrāṇāṃ kimanyadapayācitam||	If a man acquire the divine nature, what else is there that he can ask for? Accordingly Utpalācārya says— "What more can they ask who are rich in the wealth of devotion? What else can they ask who are poor in this?"
itthaṃ ṣaṣṭhīsamāsapakṣe prayojanaṃ nirdiṣṭam|	We have thus explained the motive expressed in the words the method of attaining all felicities, on the supposition that the compound term is a Tatpuruṣa genitively constructed.
bahuvrīhipakṣe tūpapādayāmaḥ|	Let it be taken as a Bahuvrīhi or relative compound.
samastasya bāhyābhyantarasya nityasukhāderyā saṃpatsiddhiḥ tathātvaprakāśaḥ, tasyāḥ samyagavāptiryasyāḥ pratyabhijñāyāḥ hetuḥ sā tathoktā| tasya maheśvarasya pratyabhijñā, prati ābhimukhyena, jñānam|	Then the recognition of Maheśvara, the knowing him through vicarious idols, has for its motive the full attainment, the manifestation, of all felicities, of every external and internal permanent happiness in their proper nature.
loke hi sa evāyaṃ caitra iti pratisaṃdhānenābhimukhībhūte vastuni jñānaṃ pratyabhijñeti vyavahriyate|	In the language of everyday life, recognition is a cognition relative to an object represented in memory: for example, This (perceived) is the same (as the remembered) Caitra.
ihāpi prasiddhapurāṇa- siddhāgamānumānādijñātaparipūrṇaśaktike parameśvare sati svātmani abhimukhībhūte tacchaktipratisaṃdhānena jñānamudeti nūnaṃ sa eveśvaro'hamiti|	In the recognition propounded in this system,—there being a God whose omnipotence is learnt from the accredited legendaries, from accepted revelation, and from argumentation,—there arises in relation to my presented personal self the cognition that I am that very God,—in virtue of my recollection of the powers of that God.
tāmetāṃ pratyabhijñānupapādayāmi|	This same recognition I set forth.
upapattiḥ saṃbhavaḥ|	To set forth is to enforce.
saṃbhavatīti satsamarthācāraṇena prayojakavyāpāreṇa saṃpādayāmītyarthaḥ|	I establish this recognition by a stringent process which renders it convincing. [Such is the articulate development of the first aphorism of the Recognitive Institutes.]

The answer is this:—The recognition is thus exhibited, because though the soul is, as you contend, continually manifested as self-luminous (and therefore identical with God), it is nevertheless under the influence of the cosmothetic illusion manifested as partial, and therefore the recognition must be exhibited by an expansion of the cognitive and active powers in order to achieve the manifestation of the soul as total (the self being to the natural man a part, to the man of insight the whole, of the divine pleroma).
tathā ca prayogaḥ 'ayamātmā parameśvaro bhavitumarhati| jñānakriyāśaktimattvāt| yo yāvati jñātā kartā ca sa tāvatīśvaraḥ prasiddheśvaravadrājavadvā| ātmā ca viśvajñātā kartā ca| tasmādīśvaro'yam' iti|	Thus, then, the syllogism: This self must be God, because it possesses cognitive and active powers; for so far forth as any one is cognitive and active, to that extent he is a lord, like a lord in the world of everyday life, or like a king, therefore the soul is God.
avayavapañcakasyāśrayaṇaṃ māyāvadeva naiyāyikamatasya kakṣīkārāt|	The five-membered syllogism is here employed, because so long as we deal with the illusory order of things, the teaching of the Naiyāyikas may be accepted.
tadaktamuduyākarasūnunā - kartari jñātari svātmanyādisiddhe maheśvare| ajaḍātmā niṣedhaṃ vā siddhiṃ vā vidadhīta kaḥ||	It has thus been said by the son of Udayākara— "What self-luminous self can affirm or deny that self-active and cognitive is Maheśvara the primal being?
śaktyāviṣkaraṇeneyaṃ pratyabhijñopadarśyate||	"Such recognition must be effected by an expansion of the powers, the self being cognised under illusion, and imperfectly discerned."
tathā hi- sarveṣāmiha bhūtānāṃ pratiṣṭhā jīvadāśrayā| jñānaṃ kriyā ca bhūtānāṃ jīvatāṃ jīvanaṃ matam||	"The continuance of all living creatures in this transmigratory world lasts as long as their respiratory involucrum; knowledge and action are accounted the life of living creatures.
tatra jñānaṃ svataḥsiddhaṃ kriyā kāryāśritā satī|	"Of these, knowledge is spontaneously developed, and action (or ritual), which is best at Kāśi,
parairapyupalakṣyeta tathānyajñānamucyate||	"Is indicated by others also: different from these is real knowledge."
yā caiṣāṃ pratibhā tattatpadārthakramarūpitā|	"The knowledge of these things follows the sequence of those things:
akramānandūcidrapaḥ pramātā sa maheśvaraḥ||	"The knower, whose essence is beatitude and knowledge without succession, is Maheśvara."
iti ca|| somānandanāthapādairapi - sadā śivātmanā vetti sadā vetti madātmanā| ityādi|	Somānandanātha also says— "He always knows by identity with Śiva: he always knows by identity with the real."
jñānādhikāraparisamāptāvapi - tadaikyena vinā nāsti saṃvidāṃ lokapaddhatiḥ|	Again at the end of the section on knowledge— "Unless there were this unity with Śiva, cognitions could not exist as facts of daily life:
prakāśaikyāttadekatvaṃ mātaikaḥ sa iti sthitiḥ||	"Unity with God is proved by the unity of light.
sa eva vimṛśatvena niyatena maheśvaraḥ|	"He is Maheśvara, the great Lord, by reason of the unbroken continuity of objects:
vimarśa eva devasya śuddhe jñānakriye yataḥ||	"Pure knowledge and action are the playful activity of the deity."
'tameva bhāntamanubhāti sarvaṃ, tasya bhāsā sarvabhidaṃ vibhāti' (kāṭhaka02/2) iti śrutyā prakāśacidrūpamahimnā sarvasya bhāvajātasya bhāsakatvamabhyupeyate| tataśca viṣayaprakāśasya nīlaprakāśaḥ pītaprakāśa iti viṣayoparāgabhedādbhedaḥ|	The following is an explanation of Abhinava-gupta:—The text, "After that as it shines shines the all of things, by the light of that shines diversely this All," teaches that God illumines the whole round of things by the glory of His luminous intelligence, and that the diversity or plurality of the object world, whereby the light which irradiates objects is a blue, a yellow light, and the like, arises from diversity of tint cast upon the light by the object.
vastutastu deśakālākārasaṃkocavaikalyādabheda eva|	In reality, God is without plurality or difference, as transcending all limitations of space, time, and figure.
sa eva caitanyarūpaḥ prakāśaḥ pramātetyucyate| tathā ca paṭhitaṃ śivasūtreṣu- 'caitanyamātmā' (1/1) iti| tasya cidrūpatvamanavacchinnavimarśatvamananyonmukhatva - mānandaikaghanatvaṃ māheśvaryamiti paryāyaḥ|	He is pure intelligence, self-luminousness, the manifester; and thus we may read in the Śaiva aphorisms, "Self is intelligence." His synonymous titles are Intelligential Essence, Unintermitted Cognition, Irrespective Intuition, Existence as a mass of Beatitude, Supreme Domination.
sa eva hyayaṃ bhāvātmā vimarśaḥ śuddhe pāramārthikyau jñānakriye| tatra prakāśarūpatā jñānam| svato jagannirmātṛtvaṃ kriyā|	This self-same existing self is knowledge. By pure knowledge and action (in the passage of Somānandanātha cited above) are meant real or transcendent cognition and activity.
tacca nirupitaṃ kriyādhikāre- eṣa cānantaśaktitvādevamābhāsayatyamūn| bhāvānicchāvaśādeṣāṃ kriyā nirmātṛtāsya sā||	This is described in the section on activity— "He by his power of bliss gives light unto these objects, through the efficacy of his will: this activity is creativeness."
upasaṃhāre'pi - itthaṃ tathā ghaṭapaṭādyākārajagadātmanā|	And at the close of the same section—
tiṣṭhāsorevāmicchaiva hetukartṛkṛtā kriyā|| tasminsatīdamastīti kāryakāraṇatā'pi yā|	"The mere will of God, when he wills to become the world under its forms of jar, of cloth, and other objects, is his activity worked out by motive and agent.
sāpyapekṣāvihīnānāṃ jaḍānāṃ nopapadyate||	"This process of essence into emanation, whereby if this be that comes to be, cannot be attributed to motiveless, insentient things."
iti nyāyena yato jaḍasya na kāraṇatā na vā'nīśvarasya cetanasyāpi, tasmāttena tena jagadgatajanmasthityādibhāvavikāratattadbhedakriyāsahasrarūpeṇa sthātumicchoḥ svatantrasya bhagavato maheśvarasyecchai va uttarottaramucchū nasvabhāvā kriyā viśvakartṛtvaṃ vocyata iti|	According to these principles, causality not pertaining either to the insentient or to the non-divine intelligence, the mere will of Maheśvara, the absolute Lord, when he wills to emanate into thousands of forms, as this or that difference, this or that action, this or that modification of entity, of birth, continuance, and the like, in the series of transmigratory environments,—his mere will is his progressively higher and higher activity, that is to say, his universal creativeness.
icchāmātreṇa jagannirmāṇamityatra dṛṣṭānto'pi spaṣṭaṃ nirdiṣṭaḥ - yogināmapi mṛdbīje vinaivecchāvaśena yat|	How he creates the world by his will alone is clearly exhibited in the following illustration— "The tree or jar produced by the mere will of thaumaturgists, without clay, without seed, continues to serve its proper purpose as tree or jar."
ghaṭādi jāyate tattatsthirabhāvakriyākaram|| yadi ghaṭādikaṃ prati mṛdādyeva paramārthataḥ kāraṇaṃ syāttarhi kathaṃ yogīcchāmātreṇa ghaṭādijanma syāt? athocyeta- anya eva mṛdbījādijanyā ghaṭāṅku rādayo, yogīcchājanyāstvanya eveti| tatrāpi bodhyasesāmagrībhedāttāvatkāryabheda iti sarvajanaprasiddham|	If clay and similar materials were really the substantial cause of the jar and the rest, how could they be produced by the mere volition of the thaumaturgist? If you say: Some jars and some plants are made of clay, and spring from seeds, while others arise from the bare volition of the thaumaturgist; then we should inform you that it is a fact notorious to all the world that different things must emanate from different materials.
ye tu varṇayanti nopādānaṃ vinā ghaṭādyutpattiriti, yogī tvicchayā paramāṇūnvyāpārayan saṃghaṭayatīti te'pi bodhanīyāḥ| yadi paridṛṣṭakāryakāraṇabhāvaviparyayo na labhyeta tarhi ghaṭe mṛddaṇḍacakrādi dehe strīpuruṣasaṃyogādi sarvamapekṣyeta|	As for those who say that a jar or the like cannot be made without materials to make it of, and that when a thaumaturgist makes one he does so by putting atoms in motion by his will, and so composing it: they may be informed that unless there is to be a palpable violation of the causal relation, all the co-efficients, without exception, must be desiderated; to make the jar there must be the clay, the potter's staff, the potter's wheel, and all the rest of it; to make a body there must be the congress of the male and female, and the successive results of that congress.
tathā ca yogīcchāsamanantara- saṃjātaghaṭadehādisaṃbhavo duḥsamartha eva syāt|	Now, if that be the case, the genesis of a jar, a body, or the like, upon the mere volition of the thaumaturgist, would be hardly possible.
cetana eva tu tathā bhāti, bhagavān bhūribhago mahādevoniyatyanuvartanollaṅghanaghanatarasvātantrya iti pakṣe na kācidanupapattiḥ|	On the other hand, there is no difficulty in supposing that Mahādeva, amply free to remain within or to over-step any limit whatever, the Lord, manifold in his operancy, the intelligent principle, thus operates.
ata evoktaṃ vasuguptācāryaiḥ - nirupādānasaṃbhāramabhittāveva tanvate|	Thus it is that Vasuguptācārya says—
jagaccitraṃ namastasmai kalānāthāya śūline||	"To him that painted this world-picture without materials, without appliances, without a wall to paint it on,—to him be glory, to him resplendent with the lunar digit, to him that bears the trident."
nanu pratyagātmanaḥ parameśvarābhinnatve saṃsārasaṃbandhaḥ kathaṃ bhavediti cet - tatroktamāgamādhikāre - eṣa pramātā māyāndhaḥ saṃsārī karmabandhanaḥ|	It may be asked: If the supersensible self be no other than God, how comes this implication in successive transmigratory conditions? The answer is given in the section treating of accredited institution— "This agent of cognition, blinded by illusion, transmigrates through the fatality of works:
vidyādijñāpitaiśvaryaściddhano mukta ucyate||	"Taught his divine nature by science, as pure intelligence, he is enfranchised."
nanu prameyasya pramātrabhinnatve baddhamuktayoḥ prameyaṃ prati ko viśeṣaḥ ? atrāpyuttaramuktaṃ tattvārthasaṃgrahādhikāre - meyaṃ sādhāraṇaṃ muktaḥ svātmābhedena manyate|	It may be asked: If the subject and the object are identical, what difference can there be between the self bound and the self liberated in regard to the objects cognisable by each? The answer to this question is given in a section of the Tattvārtha-Saṅgraha—
maheśvaro yathā baddhaḥ punaratyantabhedavat|| nanvātmanaḥ parameśvaratvaṃ svābhāvikaṃ cennārthaḥ pratyabhijñāprārthanayā|	"Self liberated cognises all that is cognisable as identical with itself, like Maheśvara free from bondage: the other (or unliberated) self has in it infinite plurality."
na hi bījamapratijñātaṃ sati sahakārisākalye'ṅkuraṃ notpādayati|	An objection may be raised: If the divine nature is essential to the soul, there can be no occasion to seek for this recognition; for if all requisites be supplied, the seed does not fail to germinate because it is unrecognised.
tasmātkasmādvātmapratyabhijñāne nirbandha iti cet - ucyate| śrṛṇu tāvadidaṃ rahasyam|	Why, then, this toilsome effort for the recognition of the soul? To such an objection we reply: Only listen to the secret we shall tell you.
dvividhā hyārthakriyā- bāhyāṅku rādikā, pramātṛviśrānticamatkārasārā prītyādirūpā ca|	All activity about objects is of two degrees, being either external, as the activity of the seed in developing the plant, or internal, as the activity which determines felicity, which consists in an intuition which terminates in the conscious self.
tatrādyā pratyabhijñānaṃ nāpekṣate| dvitīyā tu tadapekṣata eva|	The first degree of activity presupposes no such recognition as the system proposes, the second does presuppose it.

nanu pramātṛviśrāntisārārthakriyā pratyabhijñānena vinā adṛṣṭā satī tasmindṛṣṭeti kva dṛṣṭam ? atrocyatenāyakaguṇagaṇa- saṃśravaṇapravṛddhānurāgā kācana kāminī madanavihvalā virahakleśamasahamānā madanalekhāvalambanena svāvasthānivedanāni vidhatte|	It may be urged that peculiar activity terminating in the conscious self is observed independent of recognition. To this it is replied: A certain damsel, hearing of the many good qualities of a particular gallant, fell in love with him before she had seen him, and agitated by her passion and unable to suffer the pain of not seeing him, wrote to him a love-letter descriptive of her condition.
tathā vegāttannikaṭamaṭantyapi tasminnavalokite'pi tadavalokanaṃ tadīyaguṇaparāmarśābhāve janasādhāraṇatvaṃ prāpte hṛdayaṅgamabhāvaṃ na labhate|	He at once came to her, but when she saw him she did not recognise in him the qualities she had heard about; he appeared much the same as any other man, and she found no gratification in his society.
yadā tu dūtīvacanāt tadīyaguṇaparāmarśaṃ karoti tadā tatkṣaṇameva pūrṇabhāvamabhyeti|	So soon, however, as she recognised those qualities in him as her companions now pointed them out, she was fully gratified.
evaṃ svātmani viśveśvarātmanā bhāsamāne'pi tannirbhāsanaṃ tadīyaguṇaparāmarśa virahasamaye pūrṇabhāvaṃ na saṃpādayati| yadā tu guruvacanādinā sarvajñatvasarvakartṛtvādilakṣaṇaparameśvarotkarṣaparāmarśoṃ jāyate tadā tatkṣaṇameva pūrṇātmatālābhaḥ|	In like manner, though the personal self be manifested as identical with the universal soul, its manifestation effects no complete satisfaction so long as there is no recognition of those attributes; but as soon as it is taught by a spiritual director to recognise in itself the perfections of Maheśvara, his omniscience, omnipotence, and other attributes, it attains the whole pleroma of being.
taduktaṃ caturthe vimarśe - taistairapyupayācitairupanatastasyāḥ sthito'pyantike kānto lokasamāna evamaparijñāto na rantuṃ yathā| lokasyaiṣa tathānavekṣitaguṇaḥ svātmāpi viśveśvaro naivāyaṃ nijavaibhavāya tadiyaṃ tatpratyabhijñoditā||	It is therefore said in the fourth section— "As the gallant standing before the damsel is disdained as like all other men, so long as he is unrecognised, though he humble himself before her with all manner of importunities: In like manner the personal self of mankind, though it be the universal soul, in which there is no perfection unrealised, attains not its own glorious nature; and therefore this recognition thereof must come into play."
(ī.pra.4/2/2) abhinavaguptādibhirācāryairvihitapratāno'pyayamarthaḥ saṃgrahamupakramamāṇairasmābhirvistarabhiyā na pratānita iti sarvaṃ śivam||	This system has been treated in detail by Abhinava-gupta and other teachers, but as we have in hand a summary exposition of systems, we cannot extend the discussion of it any further lest our work become too prolix.
atha raseśvaradarśanam ||9||	This then may suffice.[3]
apare māheśvarāḥ parameśvaratādātmyavādino'pi, piṇḍasthairye sarvābhimatā jīvanmuktiḥ setsyatītyāsthāya, piṇḍasthairyoṃpāyaṃ pāradādipadavedanīyaṃ rasameva saṃgirante|	Other Māheśvaras there are who, while they hold the identity of self with God, insist upon the tenet that the liberation in this life taught in all the systems depends upon the stability of the bodily frame, and therefore celebrate the virtues of mercury or quicksilver as a means of strengthening the system.
rasasya pāradatvaṃ saṃsāraparaprāpaṇahetutvena|	Mercury is called pārada, because it is a means of conveyance beyond the series of transmigratory states.
taduktam - saṃsārasya paraṃ pāraṃ datte'sau pāradaḥ smṛtaḥ|	Thus it has been said— "It gives the farther shore of metempsychosis: it is called pārada."
rasarṇave'pi - pārado gadito yasmātparārthaṃ sādhakottamaiḥ|	"It is styled pārada because it is employed for the highest end by the best votaries.
supto'yaṃ matsamo devi ! mama pratyaṅgasambhavaḥ| mama deharaso yasmādrasastenāyamucyate||	"Since this in sleep identical with me, goddess, arises from my members, and is the exudation of my body, it is called rasa."

This objection is not allowable, liberation being set out in the six systems as subsequent to the death of the body, and upon this there can be no reliance, and consequently no activity to attain to it free from misgivings.
tadapyuktaṃ tatraiva- ṣaḍdarśane'pi muktistu darśitā piṇḍapātane|	This is also laid down in the same treatise— "Liberation is declared in the six systems to follow the death of the body.
karāmalakavatsāpi pratyakṣā nopalabhyate|	"Such liberation is not cognised in perception like an emblic myrobalan fruit in the hand.
tasmāttaṃ rakṣayetpiṇḍaṃ rasaiścaiva rasāyanaiḥ||	"Therefore a man should preserve that body by means of mercury and of medicaments."
govindabhagavatpādācāryairapi - iti dhanaśarīrabhogānmatvānityānsadaiva yatanīyam|	Govinda-bhagavat also says— "Holding that the enjoyments of wealth and of the body are not permanent, one should strive
muktau sā ca jñānāttaccābhyāsātsa ca sthire dehe||	"After emancipation; but emancipation results from knowledge, knowledge from study, and study is only possible in a healthy body."
nanu vinaśvaratayā dṛśyamānasya dehasya kathaṃ nityatvamavasīyata iti cet- maivaṃ maṃsthāḥ| ṣāṭkauśikasya śarīrasyānityatve'pi rasābhrakapadābhilapyaharagaurīsṛṣṭijātasya nityatvopapatteḥ - tathā ca rasahṛdaye - ye cātyaktaśarīrā haragaurīsṛṣṭijāṃ tanuṃ prāptāḥ|	The body, some one may say, is seen to be perishable, how can its permanency be effected? Think not so, it is replied, for though the body, as a complexus of six sheaths or wrappers of the soul, is dissoluble, yet the body, as created by Hara and Gaurī under the names of mercury and mica, may be perdurable. Thus it is said in the Rasahṛdaya— "They who, without quitting the body, have attained to a new body, the creation of Hara and Gaurī,
muktāste rasasiddhā mantragaṇaḥ kiṃ karo yeṣām|| (1/7) iti||	"They are to be lauded, perfected by mercury, at whose service is the aggregate of magic texts."
tasmājjīvanmuktiṃ samīhamānena yoginā prathamaṃ divyatanurvidheyā|	The ascetic, therefore, who aspires to liberation in this life should first make to himself a glorified body.
haragaurīsṛṣṭisaṃyogajanitatvaṃ ca rasasya harajatvenābhrakasya gaurīsaṃbhavatvena tattadātmakatvamuktam - abhrakastava bījaṃ tu mama bījaṃ tu pāradaḥ|	And inasmuch as mercury is produced by the creative conjunction of Hara and Gaurī, and mica is produced from Gaurī, mercury and mica are severally identified with Hara and Gaurī in the verse— "Mica is thy seed, and mercury is my seed;
anayormelanaṃ devi mṛtyudāridrayanāśanam||	"The combination of the two, O goddess, is destructive of death and poverty."
atyalpamidamucyate|	This is very little to say about the matter.

"Certain of the gods, Maheśa and others; certain Daityas, Śukra and others;
munayo bālakhilyādyā nṛpāḥ someśvarādayaḥ||	"Certain Munis, the Bālakhilyas and others; certain kings, Someśvara and others;

ayamevārthaḥ parameśvareṇa parameśvarīṃ prati prapañcitaḥ - karmayogeṇa deveśi prāpyate piṇḍadhāraṇam|	The meaning of this, as explicated by Parameśvara to Parameśvarī, is as follows:— "By the method of works is attained, O supreme of goddesses, the preservation of the body;
rasaśca pavanaśceti karmayogo dvidhā smṛtaḥ||	"And the method of works is said to be twofold, mercury and air,
mūrcchito harati vyādhīnmṛto jīvayati svayam| baddhaḥ khecaratāṃ ku ryādraso vāyuśca bhairavi||	"Mercury and air swooning carry off diseases, dead they restore to life, "Bound they give the power of flying about."
mūrcchitasvarūpamuktam - nānāvarṇoṃ bhavetsūto vihāya ghanacāpalam| lakṣaṇaṃ dṛśyate yasya mūrcchitaṃ taṃ vadanti hi||	"They say quicksilver to be swooning when it is perceived, as characterised thus— "Of various colours, and free from excessive volatility. "A man should regard that quicksilver as dead, in which the following marks are seen—
ārdratvaṃ ca ghanatvaṃ ca tejo gauravacāpalam|	"Wetness, thickness, brightness, heaviness, mobility."
anyatra baddhasvarūpamapyabhyadhāyi - akṣataśca laghudrāvī tejasvī nirmalo guruḥ| sphoṭanaṃ punarāvṛttau baddhasūtasya lakṣaṇama||iti|	The bound condition is described in another place as follows:— "The character of bound quicksilver is that it is— "Continuous, fluent, luminous, pure, heavy, and that it parts asunder under friction."
nanu haragaurīsṛṣṭisiddhau piṇḍasthairyamāsthātuṃ pāryate, tatsiddhireva kathamiti cet- na| aṣṭādaśasaṃskāravaśāttadupapatteḥ|	Some one may urge: If the creation of mercury by Hara and Gaurī were proved, it might be allowed that the body could be made permanent; but how can that be proved? The objection is not allowable, inasmuch as that can be proved by the eighteen modes of elaboration.
taduktamācāryaiḥ - tasya prasādhanavidhau sudhiyā pratikarmanirmalā prathamam|	Thus it is stated by the authorities—
aṣṭādaśa saṃskārā vijñātavyāḥ prayatnena||	"Eighteen modes of elaboration are to be carefully discriminated,
te ca saṃskārā nirupitāḥ - svedanamardanamūrcchanasthāpanapātananirodhaniyamāśca|	And these modes of elaboration are enumerated thus— "Sweating, rubbing, swooning, fixing, dropping, coercion, restraining,

na ca rasaśāstraṃ dhātuvādārthameveti mantavyam| dehavedhadvārā mukte reva paramaprayojanatvāt|	The mercurial system is not to be looked upon as merely eulogistic of the metal, it being immediately, through the conservation of the body, a means to the highest end, liberation.

muktistāvatsarvatīrtha- karasaṃmatā|	Goddess (he replied), quicksilver is to be applied both to the blood and to the body.
carame śaśaviṣāṇakalpā syāt|	This makes the appearance of body and blood alike.

We reply: This is no objection, such liberation being inaccessible unless we acquire a healthy body.
taduktaṃ rasārṇave - darśanātsparśanāttasya bhakṣaṇātsmaraṇādapi|	Thus it is said in the Rasahṛdaya— In another place we read—
pūjanādrasadānācca dṛśyate ṣaḍvidhaṃ phalam|| ke dārādīni liṅgāni pṛthivyāṃ yāni kānicit|	"The adoration of the sacred quicksilver is more beatific than the worship of all the phallic emblems at Kāśi and elsewhere,
tāni dṛṣṭvā tu yatpuṇyaṃ tatpuṇyaṃ rasadarśanāta||ityādinā|	"Inasmuch as there is attained thereby enjoyment, health, exemption from decay, and immortality."
rasanindāyāḥ pratyavāyo'pi darśitaḥ - pramādādrasanindāyāḥ śrutāvenaṃ smaretsudhīḥ|	The sin of disparaging mercury is also set out— "The adept on hearing quicksilver heedlessly disparaged should recall quicksilver to mind.
drāktyajennindakaṃ nityaṃ nindayā pūritāśubham||	"He should at once shun the blasphemer, who is by his blasphemy for ever filled with sin."
tasmādasmaduktayā rītyā divyaṃ dehaṃ saṃpādya yogābhyāsavaśātparatattve dṛṣṭe puruṣārthaprāptirbhavati|	The attainment, then, of the highest end of the personal soul takes place by an intuition of the highest principle by means of the practice of union (ἕνωσις after the acquisition of a divine body in the manner we have described.
tadā- bhrūyugamadhyāgataṃ yacchikhividyutsūryavajjagadbhāsi| ke ṣāṃcitpuṇyadṛśāmunmīlati cinmayaṃ jyotiḥ||	"The light of pure intelligence shines forth unto certain men of holy vision, "Which, seated between the two eyebrows, illumines the universe, like fire, or lightning, or the sun:

vigalitasakalakleśaṃ jñeyaṃ śāntaṃ svasaṃvedyam||	"From which all troubles are fallen away, knowable, tranquil, self-recognised:
tasminnādhāya manaḥ sphu radakhilaṃ cinmayaṃ jagatpaśyan|	"Fixing the internal organ upon that, seeing the whole universe manifested, made of pure intelligence,
utsannakarmabandho brahmatvamihaiva cāpnoti||	"The aspirant even in this life attains to the absolute, his bondage to works annulled."
(ra0hṛ01/21-23) śrutiśca- 'raso vai saḥ| rasaṃ hyevāyaṃ labdhvānandī bhavati' (tai0 2/7/1) iti|	A Vedic text also declares: That is Rasa (mercury), having obtained this he becomes beatitude.
taditthaṃ bhavadainyaduḥkhabharataraṇopāyo rasa eveti siddham|	Thus, then, it has been shown that mercury alone is the means of passing beyond the burden of transmigratory pains.

jñāto yadyaparaṃ na vedayati ca svasmātsvayaṃ dyotate|	"Which, when it arises, pains no other soul, which shines forth by itself from itself."

ityādivacananicayaprāmāṇyāt| parameśvarasākṣātkāraśca śravaṇamananabhāvanābhirbhāvanīyaḥ|	Now the knowledge of the Supreme is to be gained by hearing (śravaṇa), thought (manana), and reflection (bhāvanā), as it has been said—
yadāha- āgamenānumānena dhyānābhyāsabalena ca|	"By scripture, by inference, and by the force of repeated meditation,—
tridhā prakalpayanprajñāṃ labhate yogamuttamam||	"By these three methods producing knowledge, he gains the highest union (yoga)."

tatrāhnikadvayātmake prathame'dhyāye samavetāśeṣapadārthakathanamakāri|	In the first book, consisting of two daily lessons, he describes all the categories which are capable of intimate relation.

In the similarly divided second book he discusses "substance," giving in the first āhnika the characteristics of the five elements, and in the second he establishes the existence of space and time.
āhnikadvayayukte tṛtīye ātmāntaḥkaraṇalakṣaṇam| tatrāpyātmalakṣaṇaṃ prathame|	In the third book he defines the soul and the internal sense, the former in the first āhnika, the latter in the second.
dvitīye'ntaḥkaraṇalakṣaṇam| āhnikadvayayukte caturthe śarīratadupayogivivecanam|	In the fourth book he discusses the body and its adjuncts, the latter in the first āhnika, and the former in the second.
dvitīye śarīravivecanama|āhnikadvayavati pañcame karmapratipādanam| tatrāpi prathame śarīrasaṃbandhikarmacintanam| dvitīye mānasakarmacintanam|	In the fifth book he investigates action; in the first āhnika he considers action as connected with the body, in the second as belonging to the mind.

tathāvidhe saptame guṇasamavāyapratipādanam| tatrāpi prathame buddhinirapekṣaguṇapratipādanam| dvitīye tatsāpekṣaguṇapratipādanaṃ samavāyapratipādanaṃ ca|	In the seventh book he discusses quality and intimate relation; in the first āhnika he considers the qualities independent of thought, in the second those qualities which are related to it, and also intimate relation.
aṣṭame nirvikalpakasavikalpakapratyakṣa- pramāṇacintanam|	In the eighth book he examines "indeterminate" and "determinate" perception, and means of proof.
navame buddhiviśaṣapratipādanam|	In the ninth book he discusses the characteristics of intellect.
daśame'numānabhedapratipādanam|	In the tenth book he establishes the different kinds of inference.[3]

We demur to this, because "division" is really included in a particular kind of enunciation.
tatra dravyaguṇākarmasāmānyaviśeṣasamavāyā iti ṣaḍeva te padārthā ityuddeśaḥ|	Thus when we declare that substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, and intimate relation are the only six positive categories,—this is an example of enunciation.

nanu ṣaḍeva padārthā iti kathaṃ kathyate abhāvasyāpi sadbhāvāt iti cet- maivaṃ vocaḥ| nañarthānullikhitadhīviṣayatayā bhāvarūpatayā ṣaḍeveti vivakṣitatvāt|	If you ask, "Why do you say that there are only six categories since 'non-existence' is also one?" we answer: Because we wish to speak of the six as positive categories, i.e., as being the objects of conceptions which do not involve a negative idea.
tathāpi kathaṃ ṣaḍeveti niyama upapadyate ? vikalpānupapatteḥ|	"Still," the objector may retort, "how do you establish this definite number 'only six'? for either horn of the alternative fails.

If it is thoroughly ascertained, why do you exclude it? and still more so, if it is not thoroughly ascertained? What sensible man, pray, spends his strength in denying that a mouse has horns? Thus your definite number 'only six' fails as being inapplicable." This, however, we cannot admit; if darkness, &c., are allowed to form certainly a seventh category (as "non-existence"), we thus (by our definite number) deny it to be one of the six positive categories,—and if others attempt to include "capacity," "number," &c., which we allow to be certainly positive existences, we thus deny that they make a seventh category.
tatra dravyāditritayasya dravyatvādijātirlakṣaṇam|	Substantiality, &c. (dravyatvādi), i.e., the genera of substance, quality, and action, are the definition of the triad substance, quality, and action respectively.
dravyatvaṃ nāma gaganāravindasamavetatve sati nityatve sati gandhāsamavetatvam|	The genus of substance (dravyatva) is that which, while it alike exists with intimate relation in the (eternal) sky and the (transitory) lotus, is itself eternal,[7] and does not exist with intimate relation in smell.[8]
guṇatvaṃ nāma samavāyikāraṇāsamavetāsamavāyikāraṇa- bhinnasamavetasattāsākṣādvyāpyajātiḥ| karmatvaṃ nāma nityāsamavetatvasahitasattāsākṣādvyāpya- jātiḥ| sāmānyaṃ tu pradhvaṃsapratiyogitvarahitamanekasamavetam| viśeṣo nāmānyonyābhāvavirodhi- sāmānyarahitaḥ samavetaḥ| samāvāyastu samavāyarahitaḥ saṃbandhaḥ iti ṣaṣṇāṃ lakṣaṇāni vyavasthitāni|	The genus of quality (guṇatva) is that which is immediately subordinate to the genus existence, and exists with intimate relation in whatever is not an intimate or mediate cause.[9] The genus of action (karmatva) is that which is immediately subordinate to the genus existence, and is not found with intimate relation in anything eternal.[10] Generality (or genus, sāmānya) is that which is found in many things with intimate relation, and can never be the counter-entity to emergent non-existence.[11] Particularity[12] (viśeṣa) exists with intimate relation, but it is destitute of generality, which stops mutual non-existence.[13] Intimate relation (samavāya) is that connection which itself has not intimate relation.[14] Such are the definitions of the six categories.
dravyaṃ navavidhaṃ pṛthivyaptejovāyvākāśakāladigātmamanāṃsi iti|	Substance is ninefold,—earth, water, fire, air, ether, time, space, soul, and mind.
tatra pṛthivyādicatuṣṭayasya pṛthivītvādijātirlakṣaṇam|	The genera of earth, &c. (pṛthivītva), are the definitions of the first four.

The genus of fire is that generality which is found with intimate relation in fire, being also found with intimate relation in the moon and gold.
ākāśakāladiśāmekai katvādaparajātyabhāve paribhāṣikyastitraḥ saṃjñā bhavanti ākāśaṃ kālo digiti|	As ether, space, and time, from their being single, cannot be subordinate genera, their several names stand respectively for their technical appellations.

ātmatvaṃ nāmāmūrtasamavetadravyatvā- parajātiḥ|	The general idea of soul is that which is subordinate to substance, being also found with intimate relation in that which is without form[21] (amūrtta).
manastvaṃ nāma dravyasamavāyikāraṇa◌ātvarahitāṇusamavetadravyatvāparajātiḥ|	The general idea of mind is that which is subordinate to substance, being also found existing with intimate relation in an atom, but [unlike other atoms] not the intimate cause of any substance.

tatra rūpādiśabdāntānāṃ rūpatvādijātirlakṣaṇam|	Their respective genera (rūpatva, &c.) are their several definitions.
rūpatvaṃ nāma nīlasamavetaguṇatvā- parajātiḥ|	The class or genus of "colour" is that which is subordinate to quality and exists with intimate relation in blue.

The genus of throwing upwards, &c., will be their respective definitions.
tatrotkṣepaṇatvaṃ nāmordhvadeśasaṃyogā- samavāyikāraṇasamavetakarmatvāparajātiḥ|	The genus of throwing upwards is a subordinate genus to action; it exists with intimate relation, and is to be known as the mediate cause of conjunction with a higher place.
evamapakṣepaṇatvādīnāṃ lakṣaṇaṃ kartavyam|	In the same manner are to be made the definitions of throwing downwards, &c.
sāmānyaṃ dvividhaṃ paramaparaṃ ca| paraṃ sattā dravyaguṇasamavetā| aparaṃ dravyatvādi|	Generality (or genus) is twofold, extensive and non-extensive; existence is extensive as found with intimate connection in substance and quality, or in quality and action; substance, &c., are non-extensive.
tallakṣaṇaṃ prāgevoktam|	The definition of generality has been given before.
viśeṣāṇāmanantatvāt samavāyasya caikatvād vibhāgo na saṃbhavati|	Particularity and intimate relation cannot be divided,—in the former case in consequence of the infinite number of separate particularities, in the latter from intimate relation being but one; their definitions have been given before.
tallakṣaṇaṃ ca prāgevāvādi|	There is a popular proverb—
dvitve ca pākajotpattau vibhāge ca vibhāgaje| yasya na skhalitā buddhistaṃ vai vaiśeṣikaṃ viduḥ ||	"Duality, change produced by baking, and disjunction produced by disjunction,—he whose mind vacillates not in these three is the true Vaiśeṣika;" and therefore we will now show the manner of the production of duality, &c.

The great doctor (Udayana) maintained that apekṣābuddhi must be the producer of duality, &c., because duality is never found separated from it, while, at the same time, we cannot hold apekṣābuddhi as the cause only of its being known [and therefore it follows that it must be the cause of its being produced[25]], just as contact is with regard to sound.
vayaṃ tu brūmaḥ dvitvādikamekatvadvayaviṣayānityabuddhivyaṅgyaṃ na bhavati anekāśritaguṇatvātpṛthaktvādivaditi| nivṛttikramo nirupyate- apekṣābuddhita ekatvasāmānyajñānasya dvitvotpattisamakālaṃ nivṛttiḥ| apekṣābuddherditvatvasāmānyajñānād dvitvaguṇabuddhisamasamayam| dvitvasyāpekṣābuddhinivṛtterdravya- buddhisamakālam|	We, however, maintain the same opinion by a different argument; duality, &c., cannot be held to be made known (jñāpya) by that non-eternal apprehension whose object is two or more individual unities (i.e., apekṣābuddhi), because these are qualities which reside in a plurality of subjects [and not in any one individual[26]] just as "severalty" does [and, therefore, as apekṣābuddhi is not their jñāpaka, it must be their janaka].
dravyabuddhestadanantaraṃ saṃskārāditi|	Next we will describe the order of the successive destructions.

In the course of this investigation the mode of production will be explained.

vibhāgajavibhāgo dvividhaḥ - kāraṇamātravibhāgajaḥ kāraṇākāraṇavibhāgajaśca|	"Disjunction produced by disjunction" is twofold,—that produced by the disjunction of the intimate [or material] causes only, and that produced by the disjunction of the intimate cause and the non-cause [i.e., the place].
tatra prathamaḥ kathyate - kāryavyāpte kāraṇe karmoṃtpannaṃ yadāvayavāntarādvibhāgaṃ vidhatte na tadākāśādideśādvibhāgaḥ| yadā tvākāśādideśādvibhāgo na tadāvayavāntarāditi sthitiniyamaḥ| karmaṇo gaganavibhāgākartṛtvasya dravyārambhakasaṃyogavirodhivibhāgārambhakatvena dhūmasya dhūmadhvajavargeṇeva vyabhicārānupalambhāt| tataścāvayakarmāvayavāntarādeva vibhāgaṃ karoti nākāśādideśāt|	We will first describe the former kind. It is a fixed rule that when the action of breaking arises in the [material] cause which is inseparably connected with the effect [i.e., in one of the two halves of the pot], and produces a disjunction from the other half, there is not produced at that time a disjunction from the place or point of space occupied by the pot; and, again, when there is a disjunction from that point of space occupied by the pot, the disjunction from the other half is not contemporary with it, but has already taken place.

When the action in the hand produces an effect in relation to any points of space, it initiates also in the same direction a disjunction of the intimate effect and the non-effect; thus the disjunction of the body [the intimate effect] and the points of space arises from the disjunction of the hand and the points of space [the hand being an intimate or material cause of the body, but the points of space being not a cause].
na cāsau śarīrakriyākāryaḥ| tadā tasya niṣkriyatvāt| nāpi hastakriyākāryaḥ vyadhikaraṇasya karmaṇo vibhāgakartṛtvānupapatteḥ|	This second disjunction is not produced by the action of the body, because the body is supposed to be at the time inactive; nor is it produced by the action of the hand, because it is impossible that an action residing in some other place [as the hand] should produce the effect of disjunction [in the body].
ataḥ pāriśeṣyātkāraṇākāraṇavibhāgastasya kāṇaramaṅgīkaraṇīyam| yadavādyandhakārādau bhāvatvaṃ niṣidhyate' iti tadasaṃgatam|	Therefore we conclude by exhaustion that we must accept the view—that it is the disjunction of the intimate cause and the non-cause[37] which causes the second disjunction of the body and the points of space.
tathāhi| dravyaṃ tama iti bhāṭṭā vedāntinaśca bhaṇanti|	But an opponent may here object that "what you formerly stated (p.
āropitaṃ nīlarūpamiti śrīdharācāryāḥ| ālokajñānābhāvaḥ iti prābhākaraikadeśinaḥ| ālokābhāva iti naiyāyikādaya iti cet - tatra dravyatvapakṣo na ghaṭate|	147) as to existence being denied of darkness, &c., is surely unreasonable; for, in fact, there are no less than four different opinions maintained on this point,—thus (a.) the Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsakas and the Vedāntins hold that darkness is a substance; (b.) Śrīdhara Ācārya[38] holds that the colour of dark blue is imposed [and thus darkness will be a quality]; (c.) some of the Prābhākara Mīmāṃsakas hold that it is the absence of the cognition of light; (d.) the Naiyāyikas, &c., hold that it is the absence of light." In reply, we assert that as for the first alleged opinion (a.) it is quite out of the question, as it is consistent with neither of the two possible alternatives; for if darkness is a substance, it must either be one of the nine well-known substances, earth, &c.,[39] or some different one.
dravyaṃ bhavadandhakārākhyaṃ pṛthivyādyanyatamamanyadvā| nādyaḥ| yatrāntarbhāvosya tasya yāvanto guṇāstāvadguṇakatvaprasaṅgāt| na dvitīyaḥ| nirguṇasya tasya dravyatvāsaṃbhavena dravyāntaratvasya sutarāmasaṃbhavāt|	But it cannot be any one of the nine, since, under whichever one you would place it, all the qualities of that substance should certainly be found in it; nor can you, on the other hand, assert that it is some substance different from these nine, since, being in itself destitute of qualities, it cannot properly be a substance at all [the very definition of substance being "that which is the substratum of qualities"], and therefore, of course, it cannot be a different substance from the nine.

We reply, that this is merely an error, as when men say that the [colourless] sky is blue. But enough of this onslaught on ancient sages.[40] (b.) Hence it follows that darkness cannot have its colour imposed upon it, since you cannot have an imposition of colour without supposing some substratum to receive it;[41] and again, we cannot conceive the eye as capable of imposing a colour when deprived of the concurrent cause, the external light.
adhiṣṭhānapratyayamantareṇāropāyogāt| bāhyālokasahakārirahitasya cakṣuṣo rūpārope sāmarthyānupalambhācca| na cāyamacākṣuṣaḥ pratyayaḥ|	Nor can we accept that it is an impression independent of the eye [i.e., produced by the internal sense, mind], because the concurrence of the eye is not a superfluous but an indispensable condition to its being produced.

Hence darkness cannot be the absence of the cognition of light, since, by the well-known rule that that organ which perceives a certain object can also perceive its absence, it would follow that darkness would be perceived by the mind [since it is the mind which perceives cognitions].[44] Hence we conclude that the fourth or remaining opinion must be the true one, viz., that darkness is only the absence of light.
na cābhāve bhāvadharmādhyāropo darupapāda uḥ| duḥkhābhāve sukhatvāropasya saṃyogābhāve vibhāgatvābhimānasya ca dṛṣṭatvāt|	And it need not be objected that it is very difficult to account for the attribution to non-existence of the qualities of existence, for we all see that the quality happiness is attributed to the absence of pain, and the idea of separation is connected with the absence of conjunction.

na cādhikaraṇagrahaṇāvaśyaṃbhāvaḥ| abhāvapratītāvadhi- karaṇagrahaṇavaśyaṃbhāvānaṅgīkārāt| aparathā 'nivṛttaḥ, kolāhalaḥ' iti śabdapradhvaṃsaḥ pratyakṣo na syāti āprāmāṇikaṃ paravacanam| tatsarvamabhisaṃdhāya bhagavānkaṇādaḥ praṇināya sūtraṃ 'dravyaguṇakarmaniṣpatti- vaidharmyādabhāvastamaḥ' (ka. 5/2/19) iti|	Nor need our opponent retort that "the cognition of darkness [as the absence of light] necessitates the cognition of the place where the absence resides [and this will require light]," as such an assertion is quite untenable, for we cannot admit that in order to have a conception of absence it is necessary to have a conception of the place where the absence resides, else we could not have the perception of the cessation of sound, as is implied in such an expression as "the tumult has ceased."[46] Hence, having all these difficulties in his mind, the venerable Kaṇāda uttered his aphorism [as an ipse dixit to settle the question]: "Dravya-guṇa-karma-nish-patti-vaidharmyād abhāvas tamas" (Vaiś. Sūt.
abhāvastu niṣedhamukhapramāṇagamyaḥ saptamo nirupyate|	Non-existence (abhāva) is considered to be the seventh category, as established by negative proofs.
saṃkṣepato dvividhaḥ saṃsargābhāvānyonyābhāvabhedāt| saṃsargābhāvo'pi trividhaḥ prākpradhvaṃsātyantābhāvabhedāt| tatrānityonāditamaḥ prāgabhāvaḥ|	It may be concisely defined as that which, itself not having intimate relation, is not intimate relation;[48] and this is twofold, "relative non-existence"[49] and "reciprocal non-existence."
utpattimānavināśī pradhvaṃsaḥ| pratiyogyāśrayobhāvo'tyantābhāvaḥ| atyantābhāvavyatiriktatve sati anavadhirabhāvonyonyābhāvaḥ|	The former is again divided into "antecedent," "emergent," and "absolute." "Antecedent" is that non-existence which, though without any beginning, is not everlasting; "emergent" is that which, though having a beginning, is everlasting; "absolute" is that non-existence which abides in its own counter-entity;[50] "reciprocal non-existence" is that which, being different from "absolute," has yet no defined limit [i.e., no terminus ad quem nor terminus a quo, as "antecedent" and "emergent" have].

This is the first aphorism of the Nyāya Śāstra.

In the first daily portion of the first book the venerable Gotama discusses the definitions of nine categories, beginning with "proof," and in the second those of the remaining seven, beginning with "discussion" (vāda).

tṛtīyasya prathame ātmaśarīrendriyārthaparīkṣaṇam| dvitīye buddhimanaḥparīkṣaṇam|	In the first daily portion of the third book he examines the soul, the body, the senses, and their objects; in the second, "understanding" (buddhi), and "mind" (manas).

In the first daily portion of the fifth book he discusses the various kinds of futility (jāti), and in the second the various kinds of "occasion for rebuke" (nigrahasthāna, or "unfitness to be argued with").

"Proof" is that which is always accompanied by right knowledge, and is at the same time not disjoined from the proper instruments [as the eye, &c.], and from the site of knowledge [i.e., the soul];[3] and this definition thus includes the peculiar tenet of the Nyāya School that God is a source of right knowledge,[4] as the author of the aphorisms has expressly declared (ii.

And thus too hath the universally renowned teacher Udayana, who saw to the farthest shore of the ocean of logic, declared in the fourth chapter of the Kusumāñjali:

We reply, "No," for it is said in the second Nyāya aphorism, "Pain, birth, activity, faults, false notions,—on the successive annihilation of these in turn, there is the annihilation of the one next before it," by means of this knowledge of the truth.
tatpratikū leṣu dveṣaḥ| vastutastvātmanaḥ pratikū lamanukū laṃ vā na kiṃ cidvastvasti|	Now false notions are the thinking the body, &c., which are not the soul, to be the soul; "faults" are a desire for those things which seem agreeable to the soul, and a dislike to those things which seem disagreeable to it,[10] though in reality nothing is either agreeable or disagreeable to the soul.
parasparānubandhitvācca rāgādīnāṃ mūḍho rajyati rakto muhyati mūḍhaḥ ku pyati ku pito muhyatīti|	And through the mutual reaction of these different "faults" the stupid man desires and the desiring man is stupid; the stupid man is angry, and the angry man is stupid.

śarīreṇa praśastāni dānaparaparitrāṇādīni| vācā hitasatyādīni| manasā ajighāṃsādīni| seyaṃ puṇyarūpā pravṛttirdharmaḥ| seyamubhayī pravṛttiḥ|	Or, again, he may do laudable actions by his body, as alms, saving others, &c., truthful speaking, upright counsel, &c., by his voice, and guilelessness, &c., by his mind; and this same right activity produces merit.
tataḥ svānurūpaṃ praśastaṃ ninditaṃ vā janma punaḥ śarīrādeḥ prādurbhāvaḥ| tasminsati pratikū lavedanīyatayā bādhanātmakaṃ duḥkhaṃ bhavati|	But both are forms of activity, and each leads to a similar laudable or blamable birth or bodily manifestation; and while this birth lasts there arises the impression of "pain," which we are conscious of as of something that jars against us.
ta ime mithyājñānādayo duḥkhāntā avicche dena pravartamānāḥ saṃsāraśabdārthoṃ ghaṭīcakravanniravadhiranuvartate|	Now this series, beginning with "false notions" and ending with "pain," is continually going on, and is what we mean by the words "mundane existence," which rolls on ceaselessly, like a waterwheel.

mithyājñānāpāye doṣā apayānti| doṣāpāye pravṛttirapaiti| pravṛttyapāye janmāpaiti| janmāpāye duḥkhamatyantaṃ nivartate| sātyantikī duḥkhanivṛttirapavargaḥ|	When false notions disappear, the "faults" pass away; with them ceases "activity;" and with it ceases "birth;" and with the cessation of "birth" comes the entire abolition of "pain," and this absolute abolition is final bliss.

We reply that as all those who maintain liberation in any form do include therein the absolute abolition of pain, our definition, as being thus a tenet accepted in all the schools, may well be called the royal highway[14] of philosophy.
tathā hi- ātmocchedo mokṣa iti mādhyamikamate duḥkhocche dostītyetāvattāvadavivādam|	Thus even the Mādhyamika's opinion that "liberation consists in the abolition of soul," does not controvert our point, so far at any rate as that it is the abolition of pain.
atha manyethāḥ - śarīrādivadātmāpi duḥkhahetutvāducche dya iti tanna saṃgacchate| vikalpānupapatteḥ|	But if you proceed to argue that the soul, as being the cause of pain, is to be abolished just like the body, &c., we reply that this does not hold, since it fails under either alternative.

(a.) If the former, we make no objection, [since we Naiyāyikas allow that cognition is evanescent,[15] and we do desire to abolish cognition as a cause of pravṛtti or action[16]], for who would oppose a view which makes for his own side? (b.) But if the latter, then, since it must be eternal,[17] its abolition is impossible; and, again, a second objection would be that no one would try to gain your supposed "summum bonum;" for surely no sensible person would strive to annihilate the soul, which is always the dearest of all, on the principle that "everything else is dear for the soul's pleasure;" and, again, everybody uses such a phrase as "liberated," [and this very term refutes the idea of annihilation or abolition].
sarvoṃ hi prāṇī sati dharmiṇi mukta iti vyavaharati nanu| dharminivṛttau nirmalajñānodayo mahodaya iti vijñānavādivāde sāmagrayabhāvaḥ sāmānādhikaraṇyānupapattiśca|	"But why not say with those Bauddhas who hold the doctrine of pure intelligence [i.e., the Yogācāras and the Sautrāntikas[18]], that 'the summum bonum' is the rising of pure intelligence consequent on the cessation of the conscious subject?" To this view we object that there is an absence of means; and also it cannot be established that the locus [or subject] of the two states is the same.
bhāvanācatuṣṭayaṃ hi tasya kāraṇamabhīṣṭam|	For the former, if it is replied that the well-known fourfold set of Bauddha contemplations[19] are to be accepted as the cause, we answer that, as [according to the Bauddha tenet of the momentary existence of all things] there cannot be one abiding subject of these contemplations, they will necessarily exercise a languid power like studies pursued at irregular intervals, and be thus ineffectual to produce any distinct recognition of the real nature of things.

āvaraṇamuktirmuktiriti jainajanābhimatopi mārgoṃ na nisargato nirargalaḥ|	Nor do we find the path of the Jainas, viz., that "Liberation is the releasing from all 'obstructions,'" a path entirely free from bars to impede the wayfarer.
aṅga, bhāvanpṛṣṭo vyācaṣṭāṃ kimāvaraṇam| dharmādharmabhrāntaya iti cet- iṣṭameva|	Pray, will our Jaina friend kindly inform us what he means by "obstruction"?[21] If he answers "merit, demerit, and error," we readily grant what he says.
atha dehamevāvaraṇam| tathā ca tannivṛttau pañjarānmuktasya śukasyevātmanaḥ satatordhvagamanaṃ muktiriti cet- tadā vaktavyam|	But if he maintains that "the body is the true obstruction, and hence Liberation is the continual upspringing of the soul consequent on the body's annihilation, as of a parrot released from its cage," then we must inquire whether this said soul possesses form or not.
kimayamātmā mūrtoṃ'mūrtoṃ ? prathame niravayavaḥ sāvayavo vā ? niravayavatve niravayavo mūrtaḥ paramāṇuriti paramāṇulakṣaṇāpattyā paramāṇudharmavadātma- dharmāṇāmatīndriyatvaṃ prasajet| sāvayavatve yatsāvayavaṃ tadanityamiti pratibandhabalenānityatvāpattau kṛtapraṇāśākṛtābhyāgamau niṣpratibandhau prasaretām|	If it possesses form, then has it parts or not? If it has no parts, then, since the well-known definition of an atom will apply here as "that which has form without parts," it will follow that the attributes of the soul are, like those of an atom, imperceptible to the senses.[22] If you say that it has parts, then the general maxim that "whatever has parts is non-eternal," would necessitate that the soul is non-eternal; and if this were conceded, then two grand difficulties [against the Providential course of the world] would burst in unopposed, viz., that what the soul has done would, at its cessation, perish with it [and thus fail of producing the proper fruit], while it would have reaped during life the effects of what it had not done [as the good and evil which happened to it would not be the consequences of its actions in a former birth].
amūrtatve gamanamanupapannameva| calanātmikāyāḥ kriyāyā mūrtatvapratibandhāt|	If, on the other hand, the Jaina maintains that the soul does not possess form at all, then how can he talk of the soul's "upspringing," since all such actions as motion necessarily involve an agent possessing form?[23]

prakṛtipuruṣānyatvakhyātau prakṛtyuparame puruṣasya svarūpeṇāvasthānaṃ muktiriti sāṃkhyākhyātepi pakṣe duḥkhocchedostyeva|	Again, the Sānkhya opinion, which first lays down that nature and soul are utterly distinct, and then holds that "liberation is the soul's remaining as it is in itself after nature [on being known] has withdrawn,"—even this opinion accepts our tenet of the abolition of pain; but there is left a difficulty as to whether this cognition of the distinction between nature and soul resides in the soul or in nature.
vivekajñānaṃ puruṣāśrayaṃ prakṛtyāśrayaṃ vetyetāvadavaśiṣyate| tatra puruṣāśrayamiti na śliṣyate| puruṣasya kauṭasthyāvasthānanirodhāpātāt|	It is not consistent to say that it resides in the soul, since the soul is held to be unchangeable, and this would seem to involve that previously it had been hampered by ignorance; nor can we say that it resides in nature, since nature is always held to be unintelligent.
nāpi prakṛtyāśrayaḥ| acetanatvāttasyāḥ| kiṃ ca prakṛtiḥ pravṛttisvabhāvā nivṛttisvabhāvā vā ? ādye'nirmoṃkṣaḥ| svabhāvasyānapāyāt|	Moreover, is nature spontaneously active or inactive? If the former, then it follows that there can be no liberation at all, since the spontaneous actions of things cannot be set aside; and if the latter, the course of mundane existence would at once cease to go on.

śrutistatra pramāṇamiti cet na| yogyānupalabdhibādhite tadanavakāśāt| avakāśe vā grāvaplavepi tathābhāva prasaṅgāt|	If you allege Śruti as the proof, we reply that Śruti has no place when the thing itself is precluded by a valid non-perception;[25] or if you allow its authority, then you will have to concede the existence of such things as floating stones.[26]
nanu sukhābhivyaktirmuktiriti pakṣaṃ parityajya duḥkhanivṛttireva muktiriti svīkāraḥ kṣīraṃ vihāyārocakagrastasya sauvīraruci- manubhāvayatīti cet- tadetannāṭakapakṣapatitaṃ tvadvaca ityupekṣyate|	"But if you give up the view that 'liberation is the manifestation of happiness,' and then accept such a view as that which holds it to be only the cessation of pain, does not your conduct resemble that of the dyspeptic patient who refused sweet milk and preferred sour rice-gruel?" Your satire, however, falls powerless, as fitter for some speech in a play [rather than for a grave philosophical argument].

nanvekamanusaṃdhitsatoparaṃ pracyavata iti nyāyena duḥkhavatsukhamapyucchidyata ityakāmyoyaṃ pakṣa iti cet- maivaṃ maṃsthāḥ|	Nor may you retort on us that we have fulfilled the proverb of "seeking one thing and dropping another in the search," since we have abolished happiness as being ever tainted by some incidental pain, and, at the same time, our own favourite alternative is one which no one can consider desirable.
sukhasaṃpādane duḥkhasādhanabāhulyānuṣaṅganiyamena taptāyaḥpiṇḍe tapanīyabuddhayā pravartamānena sāmyāpātāt| tathā hi- nyāyopārjiteṣu viṣayeṣu kiyantaḥ sukhakhadyotāḥ kiyanti duḥkhadurdināni| anyāyopārjiteṣu tu yatbhaviṣyati tanmanasāpi cintayituṃ na śakyamiti|	For the truth is that any attempt to establish happiness as the summum bonum, since it is inevitably accompanied by various causes of pain, is only like the man who would try to grasp a red-hot ball of iron under the delusion that it was gold. In the case of objects of enjoyment got together by rightful means, we may find many firefly-like pleasures; but then how many are the rainy days to drown them? And in the case of those got together by wrong means, the mind cannot even conceive the future issue which will be brought about.
etatsvānubhavamapracchādayantaḥ santo vidāṃku rvantu vidāṃ varā bhavantaḥ|	Let our intelligent readers consider all this, and not attempt to disguise their own conscious experience.

Certainly perception cannot apply here, since the Deity, as devoid of form, &c., must be beyond the senses.
vikalpāsahatvāt| kiṃ nityovagamayatyanityo vā ? ādyepasiddhāntāpātaḥ| dvitīye parasparāśrayāpātaḥ|	"But what are we to understand by this 'possessing parts'? Is it 'existing in contact with parts,' or 'in intimate relation with parts'? It cannot be the first, since this would equally apply to such eternal things as ether,[31] &c.; nor can it be the second, since this would prove too much, as applying to such cases as the [eternal] species, thread, which abides in intimate relation with the individual threads.
upamānādika- maśakyaśaṅkam| niyataviṣayatvāt| tasmādīśvaraḥ śaśaviṣāṇāyata iti cet - tadetanna caturacetasāṃ cetasi camatkāramāviṣkaroti|	It therefore fails as a middle term for your argument." We reply, that it holds if we explain the "possessing parts" as "belonging to the class of those substances which exist in intimate relation."[32] Or we may adopt another view and maintain that it is easy to infer the "possessing the nature of effects" from the consideration of their possessing intermediate magnitude.[33]

Nor can our middle term be rejected as "contradictory" (viruddha),[34] since there is no such acknowledged universal proposition connected with it as would establish the opposite major term to that in our syllogism [i.e., that they must have had no maker].
gaganādau vyibhicārāt| na dvitīyaḥ tantutvādāvanaikāntyāt| tasmādanupapannamiti cet- maivaṃ vādīḥ| samavetadravyatvaṃ sāvayavatvamiti nirukte rvaktuṃ śakyatvāt|	(c.) Nor is our middle term too general (anaikānta), since it is never found in opposite instances [such as the lake, which is the vipakṣa in the argument, "The mountain has fire because it has smoke"].
nāpyanaikāntikaḥ| pakṣādanyatra vṛtteradarśanāt| nāpi kālātyayāpadiṣṭaḥ| bādhakānupalambhāt|	(d.) Nor again is it precluded (bādhita or kālātyayopadiṣṭa), for there is no superior evidence to exercise such a precluding power.
nāpi satpratipakṣaḥ| pratibhaṭādarśanāt|	(e.) Nor is it counter-balanced (sat-pratipakṣita), for there does not appear to be any such equally valid antagonist.

tacca sarvaṃ kartṛviśeṣopahitamaryādam| kartṛtvaṃ cetarakārakāprayojyatve sati sakalakārakaprayoktṛtvalakṣaṇaṃ jñānacikīrṣāprayatnādhāratvam| evaṃ ca kartṛvyāvṛttestadupahitasamastakāra - kavyāvṛttāvakāraṇakakāryoṃtpādaprasaṅga iti sthūlaḥ pramādaḥ|	And this series inevitably involves the idea of some sort of maker; and I mean by "being a maker" the being possessed of that combination of volition, desire to act, and knowledge of the proper means, which sets in motion all other causes, but is itself set in motion by none. And hence we hold that if the necessity of a maker were overthrown, the necessity of the action of all the other causes would be simultaneously overthrown, since these are dependent thereon; and this would lead to the monstrous doctrine that effects could be produced without any cause at all.
tathā niraṭaṅki śaṅkarakiṅkareṇa - anukū lena tarke ṇa sanāthe sati sādhane|	There is a rule laid down by Śaṅkara-kiṅkara which applies directly to the present case— "When a middle term is accompanied by a sound argument to establish its validity,
sādhyavyāpakatābhaṅgātpakṣe nopādhisaṃbhavaḥ||	"Then you cannot attempt to supply a limiting condition on account of the [supposed] non-invariable concomitance of the major term."
yadīśvaraḥ kartā syāttarhi śarīrī syādityādipratikū latarka jātaṃ jāgartīti cet- īśvarasiddhayasiddhimyāṃ vyāghātaḥ|	If you maintain that there are many sound counter-arguments, such as "If the Supreme Being were a maker, He would be possessed of a body," &c., we reply, that all such reasoning is equally inconsistent, whether we allow that Supreme Being's existence to be established or not.[37]
tadaditamuduyanena - āgamādeḥ pramāṇatve bādhanādaniṣedhanam| ābhāsatve tu saiva syādāśrayāsiddhiruddhatā||	"If Śruti, &c., have any authority, your negative argument fails from being precluded; if they are fallacious, our old objection of a 'baseless inference' returns stronger than ever."
(nyā0 ku 0 3/5) iti| na ca viśeṣavirodhaḥ śakyaśaṅkaḥ| jñātatvājñātatvavikalpaparāhatatvāt|	Nor need we fear the possibility of any other contradiction to our argument, since it would be overthrown by either alternative of God's being known or unknown.[38]

His own advantage or some other being's? If it was for the former end, was it in order to attain something desired, or to avoid something not desired? It could not be the first, because this would be quite incongruous in a being who possesses every possible desire gratified; and for the same reason too it could not be the second.

If you replied that His activity was justified by compassion, any one would at once retort that this feeling of compassion should have rather induced Him to create all living beings happy, and not checkered with misery, since this militates against His compassion; for we define compassion as the disinterested wish to avoid causing another pain.

Listen attentively to my answer.
śrūyatāmavadhānena asya praśnasya prativacanaṃ prācyāṃ mīmāṃsāyāṃ prādarśi jaiminīnā muninā|	A reply to this question has been given in the older[1] Mīmāṃsā by the holy sage Jaimini.
sā hi mīmāṃsā dvādaśalakṣaṇī| tatra prathamedhyāye vidhyarthavādamantra- smṛtināmadheyārthakasya śabdarāśeḥ pramāṇyam| dvitīye upoddhātakarmabhedapramāṇāpavādaprayogabhedarūporthaḥ| tṛtīye śrutiliṅgavākyādivirodhapratipattikarmānārabhyādhītabahupradhānopakārakaprayājādiyājamāna - cintanam|	Now the Mīmāṃsā consists of twelve books.[2] In the first book is discussed the authoritativeness of those collections of words which are severally meant by the terms injunction (vidhi), "explanatory passage" (arthavāda), hymn (mantra), tradition (smṛti), and "name." In the second, certain subsidiary discussions [as e.g., on apūrva] relating to the difference of various rites, refutation of (erroneously alleged) proofs, and difference of performance [as in "constant" and "voluntary" offerings].
caturthe pradhānaprayojakatvāpradhānaprayojakatvajuhūparṇatādiphalarājasūyagatajaghanyāṅgākṣa - dyūtādicintā|	In the fourth, the influence on other rites of the principal and subordinate rites, the fruit caused by the juhū being made of the butea frondosa, &c., and the dice-playing, &c., which form subordinate parts of the rājasūya sacrifice.
pañcame śrutyādikramatadviśeṣavṛddhayavardhanaprābalyadaurbalyacintā|	In the fifth, the relative order of different passages of Śruti, &c., the order of different parts of a sacrifice [as the seventeen animals at the vājapeya], the multiplication and non-multiplication of rites, and the respective force of the words of Śruti, order of mention, &c., in determining the order of performance.
ṣaṣṭhe'dhikāri- taddharmadravyapratinidhyarthalopanaprāyaścitasatradeyavahnivicāraḥ|	In the sixth, the persons qualified to offer sacrifices, their obligations, the substitutes for enjoined materials, supplies for lost or injured offerings, expiatory rites, the sattra offerings, things proper to be given, and the different sacrificial fires.
saptame pratyakṣavacanātideśaśeṣanāma- liṅgātideśavicāraḥ| aṣṭame spaṣṭāspaṣṭaprabalaliṅgātideśāpavādavicāraḥ|	In the seventh, transference of the ceremonies of one sacrifice to another by direct command in the Vaidic text, and then as inferred by "name" or "sign." In the eighth, transference by virtue of the clearly expressed or obscurely expressed "sign," or by the predominant "sign," and cases where no transference takes place.
navame ūhavicārā- rambhasāmohamantrohatatprasaṅgavicāraḥ|	In the ninth, the beginning of the discussion on the adaptation of hymns when quoted in a new connection (ūha), the adaptation of sāmans and mantras, and collateral questions connected therewith.

In the twelfth, a discussion on prasaṅga [where the rite is performed for one chief purpose, but with an incidental further reference], tantra, cumulation of concurrent rites (samuccaya) and option.
tatrāthāto dharmajijñāsā (jai0sū0 1/1/1) iti prathamamadhikaraṇaṃ pūrvamīmāṃsārambhopapādanaparam|	Now the first topic which introduces the discussions of the Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā arises from the aphorism, "Now therefore a desire to know duty [is to be entertained by thee"].
adhikaraṇaṃ ca pañcāvayavamācakṣate parīkṣakāḥ| te ca pañcāvayavā viṣayasaṃśayapūrvapakṣasiddhānta- saṃgatirūpāḥ|	Now the learned describe a "topic" as consisting of five members, and these are (a.) the subject, (b.) the doubt, (c.) the primâ facie argument, (d.) the demonstrated conclusion, and (e.) the connection (saṅgati).
tatrācāryamatānusāreṇādhikaraṇaṃ nirupyate|	The topic is discussed according to the doctrines held by the great teachers of the system.
'svādhyāyo'dhyetavyaḥ' ityetadvākyaṃ viṣayaḥ| 'codanālakṣaṇo'rthoṃ dharmaḥ' (jai0sū01/1/2) ityārabhya 'anvāhārye ca darśanāt' (jai0sū0 12/4/47) ityetadantaṃ jaiminīyaṃ dharmaśāstramanārabhyamārabhyaṃ veti saṃdehaḥ| adhyayanavidhe- radṛṣṭārthatvadṛṣṭārthatvābhyām|	Thus the "subject" to be discussed is the sentence, "The Veda is to be read." Now the "doubt" which arises is whether the study of Jaimini's śāstra concerning duty, beginning with the aphorism, "Duty is a thing which is to be recognised by an instigatory passage," and ending with "and from seeing it in the anvāhārya," is to be commenced or not.
tatrānārabhyamiti pūrvaḥ pakṣaḥ| adhyayanavidherarthāvabodhalakṣaṇadṛṣṭaphalakatvānupapatteḥ|	The primâ facie argument is that it is not to be commenced, whether the injunction to read the Veda be held to have a visible and present or an invisible and future fruit.
arthāvabodhārtha- madhyayanavidhiriti vadanvādī praṣṭavyaḥ- kimatyantamaprāptamadhyayanaṃ vidhīyate kiṃ vā pākṣikamavaghātavanniyamyata iti na tāvadādyaḥ| vivādapadaṃ vedādhyayanamarthāvabodhaheturadhyayana- tvādbhāratādhyayanavadityanumānena vidhyanapekṣatayā prāptatvāt| astu tarhi dvitīyo yathā nakhavidalanādinā taṇḍu laniṣpattisaṃbhavātpākṣiko'vaghātovaśyaṃ kartavya iti vidhinā niyamyate, tathā likhitapāṭhenārthajñānasaṃbhavātpākṣikamadhyayanaṃ vidhinā niyamyata iti cet naitaccaturasram|	(a.) If you say that this injunction must have a visible fruit, and this can be no other[4] than the knowledge of the meaning of what is read, we must next ask you whether this said reading is enjoined as something which otherwise would not have been thought of, or whether as something which otherwise would have been optional, as we see in the rule for shelling rice.[5] It cannot be the former, for the reading of the Veda is a means of knowing the sense thereof from its very nature as reading, just as in the parallel instance of reading the Mahābhārata; and we see by this argument that it would present itself as an obvious means quite independently of the injunction.
avaghātaniṣpannaireva taṇḍu laiḥ piṣṭapuroḍāśādi- karaṇe'vāntarāpūrvadvārā darśapūrṇamāsau paramāpūrvamutpādayato nāparathā| ato'pūrvamavaghātasya niyamahetuḥ|	Well, then, let it be the latter alternative; just as the baked flour cake called puroḍāsa is made only of rice prepared by being unhusked in a mortar, when, but for the injunction, it might have been unhusked by the finger-nails.
prakṛte likhitapāṭhajanyenā- dhyayanajanyena vārthāvabodhena kratvanuṣṭhānasiddheradhyayanasya niyamaheturnāstyeva|	But in the case which we are discussing, there is no such reason for any such restriction, as the rites can be equally well performed by gaining the knowledge of the Veda's meaning by reading a written book, or by studying under an authorised teacher.
tasmādarthāvabodhahetuvicāraśāstrasya vaidhatvaṃ nāstīti|	Hence we conclude that there is no injunction to study the Pūrva Mīmāṃsā as a means of knowing the sense of the Veda.
tarhi śrūyamāṇasya vidheḥ kā gatiriti cet- svargaphalako'kṣaragrahaṇamātravidhiriti bhavānparituṣyatu| viśvajinnyāyenāśrutasyāpi svargasya kalpayituṃ śakyatvāt|	(b.) "What, then, becomes of the Vedic injunction, 'The Veda is to be read'?" Well, you must be content with the fact that the injunction will have heaven as its [future] fruit, although it merely enjoins the making oneself master of the literal words of the Vedic text [without any care to understand the meaning which they may convey], since heaven, though not expressly mentioned, is to be assumed as the fruit, according to the analogy of the Viśvajit offering.
yathā 'sa svargaḥ sarvānpratyaviśiṣṭatvāt' (jai0sū04/3/13) iti viśvajityaśrutamapyadhikāriṇaṃ saṃpādayatā tadviśeṣaṇaṃ svargaḥ phalaṃ yuktyā niraṇāyi tadvadadhyanepyastu|	3, 15), "Let that fruit be heaven, since it equally applies to all," establishes that those who are not expressly mentioned are still qualified to offer the Viśvajit sacrifice, and infers by argument that its characteristic fruit is heaven, so let us assume it to be in the present case also.
taduktam - vināpi vidhinā dṛṣṭalābhānna hi tadarthatā| kalpyastu vidhisāmarthyātsvargoṃ viśvajidādivata||iti|	"Since the visible fruit would be equally obtained without the injunction, this cannot be its sole object; we must rather suppose heaven to be the fruit from the injunction's significance, after the analogy of the Viśvajit, &c."
evaṃ ca sati vedamadhītya snāyāditi smṛtiranugṛhītā bhavati| atra hi vedādhyayanasamāvartanayoravyavadhānamavagamyate| tāvake mate tvadhīte'pi vede dharmavicārāya guruku le vastavyam|	Thus, too, we shall keep the Smṛti rule from being violated: "Having read the Veda, let him bathe." For this rule clearly implies that no long interval is to take place between reading the Veda and the student's return to his home; while, according to your opinion, after he had read the Veda, he would still have to remain in his preceptor's house to read the Mīmāṃsā discussions, and thus the idea of no interval between would be contradicted.
tathā satyavyavadhānaṃ bādhyeta|	The "authoritative conclusion" (siddhānta), however, is as follows:—
siddhāntastvanyataḥ prāptatvādaprāptavidhitvaṃ māstu| niyamavidhitvapakṣastu vajrahastenāpi nāpahastayituṃ pāryate|	We grant that it cannot be a case of vidhi, for it might have been adopted on other grounds; but not even Indra with his thunderbolt could make us lose our hold of the other alternative that it is a case of niyama.
tathā hi- 'svādhyāyo'dhyetavyaḥ' iti tavyapratyayaḥ preraṇāparaparyāyāṃ puruṣapravṛttirūpārthabhāvanābhāvyāmabhidhābhāvanāṃ pratyāyayati| sā hyarthabhāvanā bhāvyamākāṅkṣati|	In the sentence, "The Veda is to be read," the affix tavya expresses an enforcing power in the word,[6] which is to be rendered visible by a corresponding action in man, bringing a certain effect into existence; and this enforcing power seeks some corresponding end which is connected with the man's creative effort.
na tāvatsamānapadopāttamadhyayanaṃ bhāvyatvena pariramate| adhyayanaśabdārthasya svādhīnoccāraṇakṣamatvasya vāṅmanasavyāpārasya kleśārthakasya bhāvyatvāsaṃbhavāt|	Now it cannot be the act itself of reading, as suggested by the whole word adhyetavya, which it thus seeks as an end; for this act of reading, thus expressed by the word, could never be regarded as an end, since it is a laborious operation of the voice and mind, consisting in the articulate utterance of the portion read.
nāpi samānavākyopāttaḥ svādhyāyaḥ|	Nor could the portion read, as suggested by the whole sentence, be regarded as the end.
svādhyāyaśabdārthasya varṇarāśenityatvena vibhutvena cotpattyādīnāṃ caturṇāṃ kriyāphalānāmasaṃbhavāt| tasmātsāmarthyaprāpto'vabodho bhāvyatvenāvatiṣṭhate|	For the mass of words called "Veda," which is what we really mean by the words "portion read," being eternal and omnipresent, could never fulfil the conditions of the four "fruits of action," production, &c.[7] Therefore the only true end which remains to us is the knowledge of the meaning, as obtained by carrying out the sense of the words of the injunction.
arthī samarthoṃ vidvānadhikriyata iti nyāyena darśapūrṇamāsādividhayaḥ svaviṣayāvabodhamapekṣamāṇāḥ svārthabodhesvādhyāyaṃ viniyuñjate|	According to the old rule, "He has the right who has the want, the power, and the wit," those who are aiming to understand certain things, as the new and full moon sacrifices, use their daily reading to learn the truth about them.
adhyayana- vidhiśca likhitapāṭhādivyāvṛttyādhyayanasaṃskṛtatvaṃ svādhyāyasyāvagamayati|	[from the well-known technical sense of the word "read" when used in this connection], conveys the idea that the reading the Veda enjoined has a consecrated character [as taught by a duly authorised teacher].
tathā ca yathā darśapūrṇamāsādijanyaṃ paramāpūrvamavaghātādijanyasyāvāntarāpūrvasya kalpakaṃ tathā samastakratujanyamapūrvajātaṃ kratujñānasādhanādhyayananiyamajanyamapūrvaṃ kalpayiṣyati|	Therefore, as the principal apūrva, produced by the great new and full moon sacrifices, necessitates and establishes the subordinate apūrvas produced by the inferior sacrificial acts, as unhusking the rice, &c., so the mass of apūrva produced by all the sacrifices necessitates and establishes a previous apūrva produced by the restricting injunction (niyama), which prescribes reading the Veda as the means to know how to perform these sacrifices.
niyamādṛṣṭāniṣṭau vidhiśravaṇavaiphalyamāpadyeta| na ca viśvajinnayāyena phalakalpanāvakalpyate| arthāvabodhe dṛṣṭe phale sati phalāntarakalpanāyā ayogāt|	Nor is the supposition a valid one that heaven is the fruit, according to the analogy of the Viśvajit offering, since, if there is a present and visible fruit in the form of a knowledge of the meaning of the sacred text, it is improper to suppose any other future and unseen fruit.
taduktam - labhyamāne phale dṛṣṭe nādṛṣṭaphalakalpanā| vidhestu niyamārthatvānnānarthakyaṃ bhaviṣyati||	"Where a seen fruit is obtained, you must not suppose an unseen one; but if a vidhi has the restricting meaning of a niyama, it does not thereby become meaningless."
nanu vedamātrādhyāyinorthāvabodhānudaye'pi sāṅgavedādhyāyinaḥ puruṣasyārthāvabodhasaṃbhavādvicāraśāstrasya vaiphalyamiti cet- tadasamañjasam| bodhamātrasaṃbhavepinirṇayasya vicārādhīnatvāt|	But an objector may say, "Although a man who reads the simple text of the Veda may not attain to a knowledge of its meaning, still, as he who reads the Veda with its aṅgas, grammar, &c., may attain to this knowledge, the study of Mīmāṃsā will be useless." But this is not true: for even though he may attain to a simple knowledge of the literal meaning, all deeper investigation must depend on this kind of discussion.
tadyathā- 'aktāḥ śarka rā upadadhāti' (tai.brā03/12/5) ityatra ghṛtenaiva na tailādīnetyayaṃ nirṇayo vyākaraṇena nigamena nirukte na vā na labhyate| vicāraśāstreṇa tu tejo vai ghṛtamiti vākyaśeṣavaśādarthanirṇayo labhyate|	For instance, when it is said, "He offers anointed gravel," neither grammar nor nigama[8] nor nirukta will determine the true meaning that it is to be anointed with ghee and not with oil, &c.; it is only by a Mīmāṃsā discussion that the true meaning is unravelled from the rest of the passage, "Verily, ghee is brightness."[9] It is therefore established that the study of Mīmāṃsā is enjoined.
na ca vedamadhītya snāyāditi śāstraṃ guruku lanivṛttiparaṃ vyavadhānapratibandhakaṃ bādhyeteti mantavyam| 'snātvā bhuṅttaka itivat pūrvāparībhāvasamānakartṛkatvamātrapratipattyā adhyayanasamāvartanayornairantaryāpratipattoḥ| tasmādvidhi- sādharthyādevādhikaraṇasahasrātmakaṃ pūrvamīmāṃsāśāstramārambhaṇīyam|	Nor need it be supposed that this contradicts the passage of Smṛti, "Having read the Veda, let him bathe," which implies that he should now leave his teacher's house, and prohibits any further delay; as the words do not necessarily imply that the return to the paternal roof is to follow immediately on his having read the Veda, but only that it is to follow it at some time, and that both actions are to be done by the same person, just as we see in the common phrase, "Having bathed, he eats." Therefore from the purport of the injunction we conclude that the study of the Pūrva Mīmāṃsā Śāstra, consisting of a thousand "topics,"[10] is to be commenced.
idaṃ cādhikaraṇaṃ śāstreṇopoddhātatvena saṃbadhyate| tadāha-cintāṃ prakṛtisiddhayarthāmupoddhātaṃ pracakṣate||	This topic is connected with the main subject of the Śāstra as being a subsidiary digression, as it is said, "They call that a subsidiary digression which helps to establish the main subject."[11]
idamevādhikaraṇaṃ gurumatamanusṛtyopanyasyate|	I now proceed to give a sketch of the discussion of the same "topic" in accordance with the teaching of the Guru Prabhākara.
aṣṭavarṣaṃ brāhmāṇamupanīyata tamadhyāpayītetyatrādhyāpanaṃ niyogaviṣayaḥ pratibhāsate|	In the Smṛti rule,[12] "Let him admit as a pupil the Brahman lad when eight years old (by investing him with the sacred cord), let him instruct him," the object of the direction appears to be the pupil's instruction.
kaścātra niyojya iti cet - ācāryakakāma eva| saṃmānana -' (pā0sū01/3/36) iyādinā pāṇinyanuśāsanenācāryake gamyamāne nayaterdhātorātmanepadasya vidhānāt|	Now a direction must have reference to somebody to be directed; and if you ask who is here to be directed, I reply, "He who desires to be a teacher," since, by Pāṇini's rule (i. 3, 36), the root nī is used in the ātmanepada when honour, &c., are implied, i.e., here the duty which a teacher performs to his pupils.
upanayane yo niyojyaḥ sa evādhyāpanepi| tayorekaprayojanatvāt|	He who is to be directed as to admitting a pupil is the same person who is to be directed as to teaching him, since both are the object of one and the same command.
ata evoktaṃ manunā muninā - upanīya tu yaḥ śiṣyaṃ vedamadhyāpayed dvijaḥ|	Hence the inspired sage Manu has said (ii.
sāṅgaṃ ca sarahasyaṃ ca tamācāryaṃ pracakṣate|| (manu0- 2/140) iti| tataścācāryakartṛkamadhyāpanaṃ māṇavakakartṛke ṇādhyayanena vinā na sidhyatītyadhyāpanavidhi- prayuktyaivādhyayanānuṣṭhānaṃ setsyati| prayojyavyāpāramantareṇa prayojakavyāpārasyānirvāhāt|	140), "The Brāhman who girds his pupil with the sacrificial cord and then instructs him in the Veda, with its subsidiary aṅgas and mystic doctrines, they call a spiritual teacher (ācārya)." Now the teaching which is the function of the teacher cannot be fulfilled without the learning which is the function of the pupil, and therefore the very injunction to teach implies and establishes a corresponding obligation to learn, since the influencer's efforts fail without those of one to be influenced.

For even if there is no reason for us to admit a separate injunction for reading the Veda, it will still remain perpetually enjoined as a duty, because the passage which mentions it is a perpetual anuvāda or "supplementary repetition."[13] Therefore the former primâ facie argument and its answer, which were given before under the idea that there was a definite injunction to read the Veda, must now be discussed in another way to suit this new view.
vināpyarthāvabodhenādhyāpanasiddheḥ|	Now the primâ facie argument was that the study of Mīmāṃsā, not being authoritatively enjoined, is not to be commenced; the "conclusion" was that it is to be commenced as being thus authoritatively enjoined.
pāṭhamātre vicārasya viṣayaprayojanayorasaṃbhavāt| āpātataḥ pratibhātaḥ saṃdigdhorthoṃ vicāraśāstrasya viṣayo bhavati| tathā sati yatrārthāvagatireva nāsti tatra sandehasya kā kathā vicāraphalasya nirṇayasya pratyāśā dūrata eva| tathā ca yadasaṃdigdhamaprayojanaṃ na ca tatprekṣāvatpratipitsāgocaraḥ|	For their proper subject is a point in the Veda, which is doubted about from having been only looked at in a rough and impromptu way; now if there is no need of understanding the meaning at all, why should we talk of doubts and still more of any hope of ascertaining the true meaning by means of laborious discussion? And therefore in accordance with the well-known principle, 'That which is a thing of use and not a matter of doubt is an object of attainment to an intelligent man, as, for instance, a jar which is in broad light and in contact with the external and internal senses,' as there is in the present case no such thing as a subject to exercise it upon, or a useful end to be attained by it, we maintain that the study of Mīmāṃsā is not to be commenced."
yathā samanaske ndriyasaṃnikṛṣṭaḥ spaṣṭālokamadhyamadhyāsīno ghaṭa iti nyāyena viṣayaprayojanayorasaṃbhavena vicaraśāstramanārabhyamiti pūrvaḥ pakṣaḥ|	We grant, in reply, that the injunction to teach does not imply a corresponding necessity that the student must understand the meaning; still when a man has read the Veda with its subsidiary aṅgas, and has comprehended the general connection of the words with their respective meanings, this will imply an understanding of the meaning of the Veda, just as it would in any ordinary human compositions.

dṛṣṭāntadārṣṭāntikayorvaiṣamyasaṃbhavāt|	We reply, that your supposed illustration and the case in question are not really parallel.

And it is just the doubts that arise, as they occasionally will do, in reference to this intended meaning, which will be the proper "subject" of Mīmāṃsā discussion; and the settlement of these doubts will be its proper "end." Therefore, whenever the true meaning of the Veda is not obtained[14] by that reading which is virtually prescribed by the authoritative injunction to a Brahman to teach, it will be a proper subject for systematic discussion; and hence we hold that the study of Mīmāṃsā is enjoined, and should be commenced.

Would you maintain that they have no personal author because, although there is an unbroken line of tradition, there is no remembrance of any author, just as is the case with the soul"?[16] This argument is weak, because the alleged characteristics [unbroken tradition, &c.] are not proved; for those who hold the human origin of the Vedas maintain that the line of tradition was interrupted at the time of the dissolution of the universe.

Is it (1.) that no author is believed, or (2.) that no author is remembered? The first alternative cannot be accepted, since we hold that God is proved to have been the author.

The former supposition breaks down, as it would prove too much, since it would apply to such an isolated stanza as "He who is religious and has overcome pride and anger," &c.[17] And the latter supposition is inadmissible, since it would be impossible for any person who was not omniscient to know that no author of the Veda was recollected by any person whatever.

nanu- vedasyādhyayanaṃ sarvaṃ gurvadhyayanapūrvakam| vedādhyayanasāmānyādadhunādhyayanaṃ yathā|	And, again, the sentences of the Veda have been composed by a competent person, since, while they possess authority, they have, at the same time, the character of sentences, like those of Manu and other sages.

This reasoning, however [the Naiyāyikas answer], cannot rise to the height of proof, for it has no more validity than such obviously illusory reasoning, as "All study of the Mahābhārata was preceded by an earlier study of it by the pupil's preceptor, since it is the study of the Mahābhārata, which must have been the same in former times as now." But [the Mīmāṃsakas will ask whether there is not a difference between these two cases, since] the Smṛti declares that [Viṣṇu incarnate as] Vyāsa was the author of the Mahābhārata, in accordance with the line, "Who else than the lotus-eyed Viṣṇu could be the maker of the Mahābhārata?" [while nothing of this sort is recorded in any Smṛti in regard to the Veda].
ko hyanyaḥ puṇḍarīkākṣā- nmahābhāratakṛdbhavet|	This argument, however, is pithless, since those words of the Puruṣasūkta (Rig V., x.
ityādāviti cet- tadasāram| ṛcaḥ sāmāni jajñire| chandāṃsi jajñire tasmādyajustasmādajāyata||	90), "From him sprang the Ṛch and Sāman verses; from him sprang the Metres; from him the Yajus arose;" prove that the Veda had a maker.

This objection, however, is extremely weak, for the recognition in question is powerless to refute our argument, since it has reference only to identity of species, as in the case of a man whose hair has been cut and has grown again, or of a jasmine which has blossomed afresh.
tasmādvedasyāpauruṣeya- tvavācoyuktirna yukte ti cet- tatra samādhānamabhidhīyate|	Consequently the arguments in favour of the doctrine that the Veda had no personal author are inconclusive."

Is it (1.) mere procession (utpannatva) from a person, like the procession of the Veda from persons such as ourselves, when we daily utter it? or (2.) is it the arrangement—with a view to its manifestation—of knowledge acquired by other modes of proof, as in the case of treatises composed by persons like ourselves? If the first meaning be intended, there will be no dispute between us.[20] If the second sense be meant, I ask whether it is established (a.) by inference,[21] or (b.) by supernatural testimony? (a.) The former alternative cannot be correct, because your argument would equally apply to the sentences in dramas such as the Mālatīmādhava [which, of course, being a work of fiction, has no authoritative character].
atha pramātve satīti viśiṣyata iti cet- tadapi na vipaścito manasi vaiśadyamāpadyate|	If you qualify your argument by inserting the saving clause, "while they possess authority,"[22] [as supra, p. 188, line 21], even this explanation will fail to satisfy a philosopher.
pramāṇāntarāgocarārthapratipādakaṃ hi vākyaṃ vedavākyam|	For the sentences of the Veda are universally defined to be sentences which prove things that are not provable by other evidence.
tatpramāṇāntaragocarārthapratipādakamiti sādhyamāne mama mātā vandhyetivad vyāghātāpātāt|	But if you could establish that these Vedic sentences only prove what is provable by other evidence, this definition would be at once contradicted, just as if a man were to say that his mother was a barren woman.

taduktaṃ gurubhiḥ sarvajñanikāraṇavelāyām - yatrāpyatiśayo dṛṣṭaḥ sa svārthānatilaṅghanāt|	This has been declared by the Guru [Prabhākara] when he refutes the supposition of an omniscient author—

Hence (b.) we also maintain that your position cannot be established by any supposed supernatural testimony [as that quoted above from the Rig-Veda, "from him sprang the Ṛch and Sāman verses"].
pratyabhijñāvirodhāt|	For the rule of Pāṇini (iv.

sāmānyanibandhanatvamasya balavadbādhakopanipātādāsthīyate kvacid vyabhicāradarśanāddhā|	For here we ask our opponents a question—Is this idea that "the apparent sameness arises from identity of species" put forward from a wish to preclude entirely any idea of the letters being the same, or only [from an imagined fear of error] because experience shows that the recognition will sometimes be erroneous [as in the cases of the hair and jasmine mentioned above]? (a.) If it arises from the latter reason, we Mīmāṃsakas, who hold that the Veda is its own evidence, have said in reference to this timid imagination—

"But [the Naiyāyikas will ask] does not this recognition of g and other letters [as the same which we heard before] refer to the species which exists the same in each, and not to the several individual letters, since, in fact, we perceive that they are different as uttered by different persons, otherwise we could not make such distinctions as we do when we say 'Somaśarman is reading'?" This objection, however, has as little brilliancy as its predecessors, for as there is no proof of any distinction between the individual g's, there is no proof that we ought to assume any such thing as a species g; and we maintain that, just as to the man who does not understand [the Naiyāyika doctrine of] the species g, the one species [in the Naiyāyika view] will by the influence of distinction of place, magnitude, form, and individual sounds, appear as if it were variously modified as itself distinct in place, as small, as great, as long, as short; so to the man who does not understand our [Mīmāṃsaka doctrine of] one individual g, the one g (in our view) will by the diversity of "manifesters,"[25] appear to him associated with their respective peculiarities; and as contrary characters are in this way ascribed [to the letter g], there is a fallacious appearance of distinction [between different g's].

There is no proof of the former alternative; for, if it were true, as an inherent difference would have to be admitted between different g's, we should have to say, "Caitra has uttered ten g's," and not "Caitra has uttered the same g ten times." On the latter supposition, there is no proof of any inherent distinction between g's, for inherent oneness is not destroyed by a difference of external disguises.

The current use of the rejected phrase [i.e., "different" as applied to the g's] is really caused by the noise, which in each case is different.
taduktamācāryaiḥ|	This has been said by the great teacher—
prayojanaṃ tu yajjātestadvarṇādeva lapsyate| vyaktilabhyaṃ tu nādebhya iti gatvādidhīrvṛthā||	"The object which the Naiyāyikas seek by supposing a species is, in fact, gained from the letter itself; and the object which they aim at by supposing an individuality in letters, is attained from audible noises;[26] so that the assumption of species is useless."

aśrāvaṇatvopādhi- bādhitatvācca|	the ear), just as colour is to the eye."

Now we ask, amidst all this discussion, how do the Mīmāṃsakas accept as established their tenet that the authoritativeness of duty is self-proved? And what is the meaning of this so-called self-proved authoritativeness? Is it (a.) that authoritativeness springs from itself? or (b.) that it springs from the right knowledge in which it resides? or (c.) that it springs from the instrumental causes [as the eye, &c.] which produced the right knowledge in which it resides? or (d.) that it resides in a particular knowledge produced by the instrumental causes which produced the right knowledge?[38] or (e.) that it resides in a particular knowledge produced by the instrumental causes only which produced the right knowledge?

It cannot be the second, because if knowledge, which is a quality, were the cause of authoritativeness, it would have to be a substance, as being an intimate cause.[39] (c.) It cannot be the third, because 'authoritativeness' cannot properly be 'produced' at all,[40] whether we call it a general characteristic (upādhi) or a species (jāti);[41] for if we call it an upādhi, it is defined as the absolute non-existence of any contradiction to a certain kind of knowledge which does not possess the nature of recollection;[42] and this cannot be produced, for we all allow that absolute non-existence is eternal; and still less can we speak of its being produced, if we regard it as a species.

Nor can it be the fourth, for wrong knowledge [as well as right knowledge] is a particular kind of knowledge, and the instrumental causes which produce the general are included in those which produce the particular,[43] just as the general idea 'seed,' as applied to 'tree,' is included in the particular seed of any special tree, as, e.g., the Dalbergia Sisu; otherwise we might suppose that the particular had no instrumental cause at all.

As for your fifth view, we ask whether by being produced by the instrumental causes only which produced right knowledge, you mean to include or exclude the absence of a 'defect'? It cannot be the former alternative; because the followers of the Nyāya who hold that authoritativeness is proved by something external [as inference, &c.], would at once grant that authoritativeness is produced by the instrumental causes of knowledge combined with the absence of a 'defect.' Neither can it be the latter alternative; for, inasmuch as it is certain that the absence of a 'defect' is found combined with the various instrumental causes, this absence of a 'defect' is fixed as by adamantine glue to be a cause of right knowledge, since right knowledge will always accompany its presence, and be absent if it is absent,[44] and it will at the same time be not an unimportant condition.[45] If you object that non-existence (or absence) cannot be a cause, we reply by asking you whether non-existence can be an effect or not? If it cannot, then we should have to allow that cloth is eternal, as its "emergent non-existence" or destruction would be impossible.

"Therefore, as we can prove that authoritativeness is both produced and recognised by means of something external, the Mīmāṃsā tenet that 'authoritativeness is self-proved' is like a gourd overripe and rotten."
vimatā pramā vijñānasāmagrījanyatve sati tadatiriktajanyā na bhavati| apramātvānadhikaraṇatvāt| ghaṭādipramāvat| na caudayanamanumānaṃ paratastvasādhakamiti śaṅkanīyam|	This long harangue of our opponent, however, is but a vain attempt to strike the sky with his fist; for (a.) we mean by our phrase "self-proved" that while right knowledge is produced by the instrumental causes of knowledge, it is not produced by any other cause (as "defect," &c.) The following is our argument as drawn out in full:—Right knowledge is not produced by any other instrumental causes than those of knowledge, while, at the same time, it is produced by these, because it is not the site of wrongness of knowledge,—just like a jar.[48] Nor can Udayana's[49] argument be brought forward as establishing the dependence of authoritativeness on something external, for it is swallowed up by the dragon of the equally potent contradictory argument.

Again, since right knowledge can arise from the causes of knowledge per se, it would be a needless complexity to suppose that anything else is a cause, whether you call it a guṇa or the absence of a "defect" (doṣa).[51]
nanu doṣasyāpramāhetutvena tadābhāvasya pramāṃ prati hetutvaṃ durnivāramiti - cenna| doṣābhāva- syāpramāpratibandhakatvenānyathāsiddhutvāt|	"But surely if the presence of a defect is the cause of wrong knowledge, it is difficult to deny that its absence must be a cause of right knowledge?" We meet this, however, by maintaining that the absence of defect is only an indirect and remote cause, as it only acts negatively by preventing wrong knowledge.
tasmādgaṇebhyo doṣāṇāmabhāvastadabhāvataḥ| apramāṇyadvayāsattvaṃ tenotsargoṃ'napoditaḥ||	"Therefore we reasonably conclude from the presence of guṇas the absence of 'defects,'[52] from their absence the non-existence of the two kinds of non-authoritativeness,[53] and from this the general conclusion."[54]
tathā pramājñaptirapi jñānajñāpakasāmagrīta eva jāyate|	(b.) We maintain that the recognition of right knowledge is produced by the same causes only which make us perceive the first knowledge[55] [sc.
na ca saṃśayānudayaprasaṅgo bādhaka iti yuktaṃ vaktu m| satyapi pratibhāsapuṣkalakāraṇe pratibandhakadoṣādisamavadhānāttadupapatteḥ|	the eye, mind, &c.] Nor can you object that this view is precluded, because it would imply that there could be no such thing as doubt; for we answer that doubt arises in cases where, although all the causes which produce knowledge are present, there is also the simultaneous presence of some opposing cause, as a "defect," &c.

If it is, it proves too much [for it would properly apply to itself and lead us to infer its own dependence on external proof, whereas you hold it to be independent of such]; and if it is not, we should have a case of regressus in infinitum, for it will want some other proof to confirm its authoritativeness, and this too in its turn will want some fresh proof, and so on for ever.

All this appears to us simple bluster, like that of the thief who ostentatiously throws open all his limbs before me, when I had actually found the gold under his armpit.
yataḥ samīhitasādhanatājñānameva pramāṇatayāvagamyamānamicchāṃ janayatītyatraiva sphu ṭa eva prāmāṇyagrahaṇasyopayogaḥ|	It is only the knowledge that the thing is a means to attain the desired end, and this knowledge recognised as authoritative and right knowledge, which causes the definite volition to arise at all; and in this we can distinctly trace the influence of that very perception of authoritativeness [whose existence he so vehemently pretended to deny].

But enough of this prolix controversy; since it has been said—
yasmāduktam - tasmādsadbodhakatvena prāptā buddheḥ pramāṇatā| arthānyathātvahetūtthadoṣajñānādapodyate||	"Therefore the authoritativeness of a cognition, which (authoritativeness) presented itself as representing a real fact, may be overthrown by the perception of a 'defect,' which perception is produced by some sign that proves the discrepancy between the cognition and the fact."[58]

Here ta, the affix of the third person singular, denotes an enjoining power, which is "coloured" [or rendered definite] by the meaning of the root, according to the opinion of the followers of Bhaṭṭa Kumārila, who maintain that words signify[59] something definite by themselves [apart from the sentence].
yāgaviṣayaṃ niyogamiti kārye vyutpattimanusaratāmanvitābhidhānavādināṃ prabhākaraguruṇāṃ siddhānta iti sarvamavadātam||	The followers of Guru Prabhākara, on the contrary, hold that the whole sentence is a command relating to the sacrifice, as they maintain that words only signify an action or something to be done.[60] Thus all has been made plain.

Thus the very first sentence of the venerable Patañjali, the author of the "Great Commentary," is "atha śabdānuśāsanam," "Now comes the exposition of words." The particle atha ("now") is used here as implying a new topic or a commencement; and by the phrase, "exposition of words," is meant the system of grammar put forth by Pāṇini.
prārambha iti yāvat| śabdānuśāsanaśabdena ca pāṇinipraṇītaṃ vyākaraṇaśāstraṃ vivakṣyate| śabdānuśāsanamityetāvatyabhidhīyamāne saṃdehaḥ syāt| kiṃ śabdānuśāsanaṃ prastūyate na veti|	Now a doubt might here arise as to whether this phrase implies that the exposition of words is to be the main topic or not; and it is to obviate any such doubt that he employed the particle atha, since this particle implies that what follows is to be treated as the main topic to the exclusion of everything else.

We must consider that the compound in this phrase represents a genitive of the object [śabdānuśāsanam standing for śabdasyānuśāsanam], and as there is a rule of Pāṇini (karmaṇi ca, ii.
tathā ca 'karmaṇi ca' (pā.sū. 2/2/14) iti samāsapratiṣedhasaṃbhavācchabdānuśāsanaśabdo na pramāṇapathamavataratīti|	2, 14), which prohibits composition in such a construction, we are forced to concede that the phrase śabdānuśāsanam does not come before us as a duly authorised compound.

We may, however, remark in passing that some authors do maintain that the agent may in such cases be put in the genitive (as well as the object); hence we find it stated in the Kāśikā Commentary: "Some authors maintain that there should be an option in such cases without any distinction, and thus they would equally allow such a construction as 'the exposition of words of the teacher' or 'by the teacher.'" Inasmuch, however, as the words of the phrase in question really mean that the "exposition" intended relates to words and not to things, and since this can be at once understood without any mention of the agent, i.e., the teacher, any such mention would be plainly superfluous; and therefore as the object and the agent are not both expressed in one and the same sentence, this is not an instance of the genitive of the object (coming under ii.

tatra kimapi codyaṃ nāvataratyeva| yadyevaṃ tarhi śeṣalakṣaṇāyāḥ ṣaṣṭhyāḥ sarvatra suvacatvāt ṣaṣṭhīsamāsapratiṣedhasūtrāṇāmānarthakyaṃ prāpnuyāditi cet - satyam| teṣāṃ svaracintāyāmupayogo vākyapadīye hariṇā prādarśi|	"But," it might be replied, "your alleged 'residual genitive' could be assumed everywhere, and we should thus find all the prohibitions of composition in constructions with a genitive case rendered utterly nugatory." This we readily grant, and hence Bhartṛhari in his Vākyapadīya has shown that these rules are mainly useful where the question relates to the accent.[7] To this effect are the words of the great doctor Vardhamāna—
tadāha mahopādhyāyavardhamānaḥ - laukikavyavahāreṣu yatheṣṭaṃ ceṣṭatāṃ janaḥ|	"In secular utterances men may proceed as they will,
vaidikeṣu tu mārgeṣu viśeṣoktiḥ pravartatām||	"But in Vaidic paths let minute accuracy of speech be employed.
iti pāṇinisūtrāṇāmarthavattvamasau yataḥ|	"Thus have they explained the meaning of Pāṇini's sūtras, since
janikarturiti brūte tatprayojaka ityapi||	"He himself uses such phrases as janikartuḥ and tatprayojakaḥ."[8]

śabdānuśāsanamityanvarthasamākhyopādane tadīyavedāṅgatvapratipādakaprayojanānvākhyānasiddheḥ| anyathā prayojanānabhidhāne vyākaraṇā- dhyayane'dhyetṛṇāṃ pravṛttireva na prasajyet|	"Well, then, for the sake of directly understanding this intended meaning, it would have been better to have said 'now comes grammar,' as the words 'now comes the exposition of words' involve a useless excess of letters." This objection cannot, however, be allowed, since the employment of such a word as śabdānuśāsanam, the sense of which can be so readily inferred from its etymology, proves that the author intends to imply an end which shall establish that grammar is a subordinate study (aṅga) to the Veda.[9] Otherwise, if there were no such end set forth, there would be no consequent application of the readers to the study of grammar.

tathā hi- purā kila vedamadhītyādhyetārastvaritā vaktāro bhavanti|	Thus in old times the students, after reading the Veda, used to be in haste to say—
vedānno vaidikāḥ śabdāḥ siddhāḥ, lokācca laukikāḥ|	"Are not Vaidic words established by the Veda and secular by common life,
tasmādanarthakaṃ vyākaraṇamiti|	"And therefore grammar is useless?"
tasmādvedāṅgatvaṃ manyamānāstadadhyayane pravṛttimakārṣuḥ|	Therefore it was only when they understood it to be an aṅga of the Veda that they applied themselves to its study.
tataśca idānīṃtanānāmapi tatra pravṛttirna sidhyet|	So in the same way the students of the present day would not be likely to apply themselves to it either.
sā mā prasāṅkṣīditi tadīyavedāṅgatvapratipādakaṃ prayojanamanvākhyeyameva|	It is to obviate this danger that it becomes necessary to set forth some end which shall, at the same time, establish that grammar is an aṅga of the Veda.

ata eva yājñikāḥ paṭhanti- āhitāgnirapaśabdaṃ prayujya prāyaścittīyāṃ sārasvatīmiṣṭiṃ nirvapediti| atastadīyavedāṅgatva- pratipādakaprayojanānvākhyānārthamatha śabdānuśāsanamityeva kathyate nātha vyākaraṇamiti|	Hence the followers of sacrifice read, "One who keeps up a sacrificial fire, on using an incorrect word, should offer an expiatory offering to Sarasvatī." Now it is to declare this end which establishes that it is an aṅga of the Veda that he uses the words atha śabdānuśāsanam and not atha vyākaraṇam.
bhavati ca śabdasaṃskāro vyākaraṇaśāstrasya prayojanam| tasmācchabdānuśiṣṭiḥ saṃskārapadavedanīyā śabdānuśāsanasya prayojanam|	Just as in a sacrifice undertaken with a view to heaven, heaven is the end; in the same way the end of the exposition of words is instruction concerning words, i.e., propriety of speech.

Nor can it be said that reading the Veda word by word is the true means; for this cannot be a means for the understanding of words, since their number is infinite, as divided into proper and improper words.[11] Thus there is a tradition that Bṛhaspati for a thousand divine years taught to Indra the study of words as used in their individual forms when the Veda is read word by word,[12] and still he came not to the end.
kimutādya yaściraṃ jīvati sa varṣaśataṃ jīvati| adhītibodhācaraṇapracāraṇaiścaturbhirhyupāyairvidyopayuktā bhavati| tatrādhyayanakālenaiva sarvamāyurupayuktaṃ syāt| tasmādanabhyupāyaḥ śabdānāṃ pratipattau pratipadapāṭha iti prayojanaṃ na sidhyediti cet - maivam śabdapratipatteḥ pratipadapāṭhasādhyatvānaṅgīkārāt|	Here the teacher was Bṛhaspati, the pupil was Indra, and the time of study a thousand years of the gods; and yet the termination was not reached,—how much less, then, in our day, let a man live ever so long? Learning is rendered efficient by four appropriate means,—reading, understanding, practising, and handing it on to others; but in the proposed way life would only suffice for the bare time of reading; therefore the reading word by word is not a means for the knowledge of words, and consequently, as we said at first, the desired end is not established." We reply, however, that it was never conceded that the knowledge of words was to be attained by this reading word by word.
prakṛtyādivibhāga- kalpanāvatsu lakṣyeṣu sāmānyaviśeṣarūpāṇāṃ lakṣaṇānāṃ parjanyavatsakṛdeva pravṛttau bahūnāṃ śabdānāmanuśāsanopalambhācca|	And again, since general and special rules apply at once to many examples, when these are divided into the artificial parts called roots, &c. (just as one cloud rains over many spots of ground), in this way we can easily comprehend an exposition of many words.
tathā hi|	Thus, for instance, by the general rule (iii.
'karmaṇyaṇ' (pā0sū0 3/2/1) ityekena sāmānyarūpeṇa lakṣaṇena karmoṃpapadāddhātumātrādaṇpratyaye kṛte 'kumbhakāraḥ' 'kāṇḍalāvaḥ' ityādīnāṃ bahūnāṃ śabdānāmanuśāsanamupalabhyate|	2, 1), karmaṇi, the affix aṇ is enjoined after a root when the object is in composition with it; and by this rule we learn many words, as kumbhakāra, "a potter," kāṇḍalāva, "a cutter of stems," &c. But the supplementary special rule (iii.
evam 'āto'nupasarge kaḥ' (pā.sū.3/2/18) ityekena viśeṣalakṣaṇenā- kārāntāddhātoḥ kapratyaye kṛte dhānyado dhanada ityādīnāṃ vahūnāṃ śabdānāmanuśāsanamupalabhyate|	2, 3), āto 'nupasarge kaḥ, directing that the affix ka is to be used after a root that ends in long ā when there is no upasarga, shows how impracticable this reading word by word would be [since it would never teach us how to distinguish an upasarga].
nanvanyeṣvapyaṅgeṣu satsu kimityetadevādriyate? ucyate - pradhānaṃ ca ṣaṭsvaṅgeṣu vyākaraṇam| pradhāne ca kṛto yatnaḥ phalavānbhavati|	"But since there are other aṅgas, why do you single out grammar as the one object of honour?" We reply, that among the six aṅgas the principal one is grammar, and labour devoted to what is the principal is sure to bear fruit.
taduktam - āsannaṃ brāhmaṇastasya tapasāmuttamaṃ tapaḥ|	Thus it has been said— "Nigh unto Brahman himself, the highest of all religious austerities,
prathamaṃ chandasāmaṅgamāhurvyākaraṇaṃ budhāḥ||	"The wise have called grammar the first aṅga of the Veda."
tasmād vyākaraṇaśāstrasya śabdānuśāsanaṃ bhavati sākṣātprayojanam| pāraṃparyeṇa tu vedarakṣādīni|	Hence we conclude that the exposition of words is the direct end of the rules of grammar, but its indirect end is the preservation, &c., of the Veda.

Others also have said that "a single word thoroughly understood and rightly used becomes in Svarga the desire-milking cow." Thus (they say)—
tathā - nākamiṣṭasukhaṃ yānti suyuktairbaddhavāgrathaiḥ|	"They proceed to heaven, with every desired happiness, in well-yoked chariots of harnessed speech;
atha patkāṣiṇo yānti ye cikkamitabhāṣiṇaḥ||	"But those who use such false forms as acīkramata must trudge thither on foot."[14]

vṛṣabha iti prasiddhavṛṣabhatvena rūpaṇaṃ kriyate| varṣaṇāt| varṣaṇaṃ ca jñānapūrvakānuṣṭhānena phalapradatvam|	The metaphor "bull" (vṛṣabha) is applied from its pouring forth (varshaṇa), i.e., from its giving fruit when used with knowledge.

taduktaṃ prakīrṇake - dvidhā kaiścitpadaṃ bhinnaṃ caturdhā pañcadhāpi vā|	Thus it has been said in the Prakīrṇaka— "Some make a twofold division of words, some a fourfold or a fivefold,

This we do not concede, since there is no proof that there is such a thing." We reply that our own perception is the proof.
gaurītyekaṃ padamiti nānāvarṇātiriktaikapadāvagateḥ sarvajanīnatvāt|	Thus there is one word "cow," since all men have the cognition of a word distinct from the various letters composing it.

Hence you must concede that there is such a thing as sphoṭa, as otherwise you cannot account for the cognition of the meaning of the word.

Not the first, for the letters singly exist only for a moment, and therefore cannot form a united whole at all; and not the second, since the single letters have no power to produce the cognition of the meaning [which the word is to convey].
varṇātirikto varṇābhivyaṅgyo'rthapratyāyako nityaḥ śabdaḥ sphoṭa iti tadvido vadanti|	There is no conceivable alternative other than their single or united capacity; and therefore it follows (say the wise in these matters) that, as the letters cannot cause the cognition of the meaning, there must be a sphoṭa by means of which arises the knowledge of the meaning; and this sphoṭa is an eternal sound, distinct from the letters and revealed by them, which causes the cognition of the meaning.

It is that word by which, when pronounced, there is produced the simultaneous cognition of dewlap, tail, hump, hoofs, and horns." This is expounded by Kaiyaṭa in the passage commencing, "Grammarians maintain that it is the word, as distinct from the letters, which expresses the meaning, since, if the letters expressed it, there would be no use in pronouncing the second and following ones [as the first would have already conveyed all we wished]," and ending, "The Vākyapadīya has established at length that it is the sphoṭa which, distinct from the letters and revealed by the sound, expresses the meaning."[20]

Not the latter, because it would then follow that we should find the effect of conveying the meaning always produced, since, as sphoṭa is supposed to be eternal, and there would thus be an ever-present cause independent of all subsidiary aids, the effect could not possibly fail to appear.

Whichever alternative you adopt, the very same faults which you alleged against the hypothesis of the letters expressing the meaning, will have to be met in your hypothesis that they have this power to manifest sphoṭa." This has been said by Bhaṭṭa in his Mīmāṃsā-śloka-vārttika—

nāpi dvitīyaḥ| uccaritapradhvastānāṃ varṇānāṃ samūhabhāvāsaṃbhavāt|	Nor can it be the latter, because the letters, being separately pronounced and done with, cannot combine into an aggregate.

tasmādvarṇānāṃ vācakatvāsaṃbhavātsphoṭo- 'bhyupagantavyaḥ|	Therefore, since it is impossible that letters should express the meaning, we must accept the hypothesis of sphoṭa.

Therefore, since Bhartṛhari has shown in his first book that the letters of a word [being many and successive] cannot manifest the meaning of the word, as is implied by the very phrase, "We gain such and such a meaning from such and such a word," we are forced to assume the existence[24] of an indivisible sphoṭa as a distinct category, which has the power to manifest the word's meaning.
etatsarvaṃ paramārthasaṃvillakṣaṇasattājātireva sarveṣāṃ śabdānāmartha iti pratipādanapare jātisamuddeśe pratipāditam|	All this has been established in the discussion (in the Mahābhāṣya) on "genus" (jāti), which aims at proving that the meaning of all words is ultimately that summum genus, i.e., that existence whose characteristic is perfect knowledge of the supreme reality[25] (Brahman).
yadi sattaiva sarveṣāṃ śabdānāmarthastarhi sarveṣāṃ śabdānāṃ paryāyatā syāt| tathā ca kvacidapi yugapattricaturapadaprayogāyoga iti mahaccāturyamāyuṣmataḥ|	"But if all words mean only that supreme existence, then all words will be synonyms, having all the same meaning; and your grand logical ingenuity would produce an astonishing result in demonstrating the uselessness of human language as laboriously using several words to no purpose at the same time!" Thus it has been said—
taduktam - paryāyāṇāṃ prayogo hi yaugapadyena neṣyate| paryāyeṇaiva te yasmādvadantyarthaṃ na saṃhatāḥ||	"The employment of synonymous terms at the same time is to be condemned; for they only express their meaning in turn and not by combination."

nīlalohitapītādyaistadvarṇamupalabhyate||	"Just as crystal, that colourless substance, when severally joined with blue, red, or yellow objects, is seen as possessing that colour."
tathā hariṇāpyuktam - saṃbandhibhedātsattaiva bhidyamānā gavādiṣu| jātirityucyate tasyāṃ sarve śabdā vyavasthitāḥ|	And so it has been said by Hari, "Existence [pure and simple] being divided, when found in cows, &c., by reason of its connection with different subjects, is called this or that species, and on it all words depend.
tāṃ prātipadikārthaṃ ca dhātvarthaṃ ca pracakṣate|	This they call the meaning of the stem and of the root.
sā nityā sā mahānātmā tāmāhustvatalādayaḥ||	This is existence, this the great soul; and it is this which the affixed tva, tal, &c., express" (Pāṇini v.

Therefore all words, as expressing definite meanings, ultimately rest on that one summum genus existence, which is differentiated by the various subjects, cows, &c., in which it resides; and hence "existence" is the meaning of the stem-word (prātipadika).

sā ca sattodayavyayavaidhuryānnityā|	So, too, if we accept Pāṇini's definition (v.
sarvasya prapañcasya tadvivartatayā deśataḥ kālato vastutaśca paricchedarāhityātsā sattā mahānātmeti vyapadiśyata iti kārikādvayārthaḥ|	1, 119), "Let the affixes tva and tal come after a word [denoting anything], when we speak of the nature (bhāva) thereof," it is clear from the very fact that abstract terms ending in tva or tā [as aśvatva and aśvatā] are used in the sense of bhāva, that they do express "existence." "This is pure existence" from its being free from all coming into being or ceasing to be; it is eternal, since, as all phenomena are developments thereof, it is devoid of any limit in space, time, or substance: this existence is called "the great soul." Such is the meaning of Hari's two kārikās quoted above.
dravyapadārthavādino'pi naye saṃvillakṣaṇaṃ tattvameva sarvaśabdārtha iti sambandhasamuddeśe samarthitam - satyaṃ vastu tadākārairasatyairavadhāryate|	So, too, it is laid down in the discussion on sambandha [in Hari's verses] that the ultimate meaning of all words is that something whose characteristic is perfect knowledge of the real meaning of the word Substance.

śuklādayaḥ śabdāḥ guṇasamavetāṃ jātimācakṣate| guṇe tatsaṃbandhāpratyayaḥ| dravye sambandhisambandhāt|	Words like "white," &c., denote a genus which similarly resides in qualities; through the connection with genus we apprehend the quality, and through the connection with the quality we apprehend the individual substance.

tasyaivārthasya satyatvamāhustrayyantavedinaḥ||	"That meaning in which the subject, the object, and the perception [which unites them] are insusceptible of doubt,[37] that only is called the truth by those who know the end of the three Vedas."
dravyasamuddeśe'pi vikārāpagame satyaṃ suvarṇaṃ kuṇḍale yathā| vikārāpagamo yatra tamāhuḥ prakṛtiṃ parām||	"That which remains as the Real during the presence of modification, as the gold remains under the form of the earring,—that wherein change comes and goes, that they call the Supreme Nature."
abhyupagatādvitīyatvanirvāhāya vācyavācakayoravibhāgaḥ pradarśitaḥ - vācyā sā sarvaśabdānāṃ śabdācca na pṛthaktataḥ|	The essential unity of the word and its meaning is maintained in order to preserve inviolate the non-duality of all things which is a cardinal doctrine of our philosophy.
tattadupādhiparikalpitabhedabahulatayā vyavahārasyāvidyāmātrakalpitatvena pratiniyatākāropadhīya- mānarūpabhedaṃ brahmatattvaṃ sarvaśabdaviṣayaḥ|	The meaning of this Kārikā is that Brahman is the one object denoted by all words; and this one object has various differences imposed upon it according to each particular form; but the conventional variety of the differences produced by these illusory conditions is only the result of ignorance.
abhede ca pāramārthike saṃvṛttivaśād vyavahāradaśāyāṃ svapnāvasthāvaduccāvacaḥ prapañco vivartata iti kārikārthaḥ|	Non-duality is the true state; but through the power of "concealment"[39] [exercised by illusion] at the time of the conventional use of words a manifold expansion takes place, just as is the case during sleep.
tadāharvedāntavādunipuṇāḥ - yathā spapnaprapañco'yaṃ mayi māyāvijṛmbhitaḥ| evaṃ jāgratprapañco'pi mayi māyāvijṛmbhitaḥ||	Thus those skilled in Vedānta lore tell us— "As all the extended world of dreams is only the development of illusion in me, so all this extended waking world is a development of illusion likewise."
taditthaṃ kūṭasthe parasminbrahmaṇi saccidānandarūpe pratyagabhinne'vagate'nādyāvidyānivṛttau tādṛgbrahmātmanāvasthānalakṣaṇaṃ niḥśreyasaṃ setsyati| 'śabdabrahmaṇi niṣṇātaḥ paraṃ brahmādhigacchati' (mahābhārata, śā0pā0a0 270) ityabhiyuktokteḥ| tathā ca śabdānuśāsanaśāstrasya niḥśreyasasādhanatvaṃ siddham|	When the unchangeable Supreme Brahman is thus known as the existent joy-thought and identical with the individual soul, and when primeval ignorance is abolished, final bliss is accomplished, which is best defined as the abiding in identity with this Brahman, according to the text, "He who is well versed in the Word-Brahman attains to the Supreme Brahman."[40] And thus we establish the fact that the "exposition of words" is the means to final bliss.
taduktam - taddvāramapavargasya vāṅmalānāṃ cikitsitam|	Thus it has been said—
pavitraṃ sarvavidyānāmadhividyaṃ pracakṣate|| vākyapadīyam 1/14) iti|	"They call it the door of emancipation, the medicine of the diseases of speech, the purifier of all sciences, the science of sciences."[41]
tathā - idamādyaṃ padasthānaṃ siddhisopānaparvaṇām| iyaṃ sā mokṣamāṇānāmajihnā rājapaddhatiḥ||	"This is the first foot-round of the stages of the ladder of final bliss, this is the straight royal road of the travellers to emancipation."
(vākya0 1/16) iti| tasmād vyākaraṇaśāstraṃ paramuruṣārthasādhanatayā'dhyetavyamiti siddham|	Therefore our final conclusion is that the Śāstra of grammar should be studied as being the means for attaining the chief end of man.
atha sāṃkhyairākhyāte pariṇāmavāde paripanthini jāgaruke kathaṃkāraṃ vivartavāda ādaraṇīyo bhavet| eṣa hi teṣāmāghoṣaḥ|	"But how can we accept the doctrine of illusory emanation [thus held by the grammarians, following the guidance of the pūrva and uttara Mīmāṃsā schools], when the system of development propounded by the Sāṅkhyas is still alive to oppose it?" Such is their loud vaunt.
saṃkṣepeṇa hi sāṃkhyaśāstre catasro vidhāḥ saṃbhāvyante| kaścidarthaḥ prakṛtireva kaścidvikṛtiprakṛtiśca, kaścidvikṛtireva, kaścidanubhaya iti|	Now the Śāstra of this school may be concisely said to maintain four several kinds of existences, viz., that which is evolvent[1] only, that which is evolute only, that which is both evolute and evolvent, and that which is neither.
tatra kevalā prakṛtiḥ pradhānapadena vedanīyā mūlaprakṛtiḥ| nāsāvanyasya kasyacit vikṛtiḥ|	(a.) Of these the first is that which is only evolvent, called the root-evolvent or the primary; it is not itself the evolute of anything else.
prakarotīti prakṛtiriti vyutpattyā sattvarajastamoguṇānāṃ sāmyāvasthāyā abhidhānāt|	It evolves, hence it is called the evolvent (prakṛti) since it denotes in itself the equilibrium of the three qualities, goodness, activity, and darkness.
taduktam - 'mūlaprakṛtiravikṛtiḥ' (sāṃ0kā03) iti| mūlaṃ cāsau prakṛtiśca mūlaprakṛtiḥ| mahadādeḥ kāryakalāpasyāsau mūlam, na tvasya pradhānasya mūlāntaramasti|	This is expressed [in the Sāṅkhya Kārikā], "the root-evolvent is no evolute." It is called the root-evolvent, as being both root and evolvent; it is the root of all the various effects, as the so-called "great one," &c., but of it, as the primary, there is no root, as otherwise we should have a regressus ad infinitum.
anavasthāpātāt| na ca bījāṅkuravadanavasthādoṣo na bhavatīti vācyam, pramāṇābhāvāditi bhāvaḥ|	Nor can you reply that such a regressus ad infinitum is no objection, if, like the continued series of seed and shoot, it can be proved by the evidence of our senses,[2]—because here there is no evidence to establish the hypothesis.
vikṛtayaśca prakṛtayaśca mahadahaṃkāratanmātrāṇi| tadapyuktam - mahadādyāḥ prakṛtivikṛtayaḥ sapta (sāṃ.kā.3) iti| asyārthaḥ| prakṛtayaśca tā vikṛtayaśceti prakṛtivikṛtayaḥ sapta mahadādīni tattvāni|	(b.) The "evolutes and evolvents" are the great one, egoism, and the subtile elements,—thus the Sāṅkhya Kārikā (§ 3), "the seven, the great one, &c., are evolute-evolvents." The seven are the seven principles, called the great one, &c.
tatrāntaḥkaraṇādipadavedanīyaṃ mahattattvamahaṃkārasya prakṛtiḥ| mūlaprakṛtestu vikṛtiḥ| evamahaṃkāratattvamabhimānāparanāmadheyaṃ mahato vikṛtiḥ| prakṛtiśca tadevāhaṃkāratattvaṃ tāmasaṃ satpañcatanmātrāṇāṃ sūkṣmābhidhānam| tadeva sāttvikaṃ satprakṛtirekādaśendriyāṇāṃ buddhīndriyāṇāṃ cakṣuḥśrotraghrāṇarasanātvagākhyānāṃ karmendriyāṇāṃ vākpāṇipādapāyūpasthākhyānāmubhayātmakasya manasaśca|	Among these the great principle, called also the intellect,[3] &c., is itself the evolute of nature and the evolvent of egoism; in the same manner the principle egoism, called also "self-consciousness" (abhimāna), is the evolute of the great one, intellect; but this same principle, as affected by the quality of darkness, is the evolvent of the five rudiments called subtile elements; and, as affected by the quality of goodness, it is the evolvent of the eleven organs, viz., the five organs of perception, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and skin; the five organs of action, the voice, hands, feet, anus, and generative organ; and the mind, partaking of the character of both; nor can you object that in our arrangement the third quality, activity, is idle, as it acts as a cause by producing action in the others.
taduktamīśvarakṛṣṇena- abhimāno'haṃkārastasmādvividhaḥ pravartate sargaḥ|	This has been thus declared by Īśvara Kṛṣṇa in his Kārikās[4] (§ 24-27), "Self-consciousness is egoism.
ekadaśakaraṇagaṇastanmātrapañcakaṃ caiva||	Thence proceeds a twofold creation, the elevenfold set and the five elemental rudiments.
sāttvikai kādaśakaḥ pravartate vaikṛtādahaṃkārāt| bhūtādestanmātraḥ sa tāmasastaijasādubhayam||	From modified[5] egoism originates the class of eleven imbued with goodness; from egoism as the source of the elements originate the rudimentary elements, and these are affected by darkness; but it is only from egoism as affected by activity that the one and the other rise.
buddhīndriyāṇi cakṣuḥśrotraghrāṇarasanatvagākhyāni| vākpāṇipādapāyūpasthāḥ karmendriyāṇyāhuḥ||	The intellectual organs are the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the skin; those of action are the voice, feet, hands, anus, and organ of generation.
ubhayātmakamatra manaḥ saṃkalpakamindriyaṃ ca sādharmyāt|| (sāṃ. kā. 24-27) iti|| vivṛtaṃ ca tattvakaumudyāmācāryavācaspatibhiḥ|	In this set is mind, which has the character of each; it determines, and it is an organ (like the other ten) from having a common property with them."[6] All this has been explained at length by the teacher Vācaspati Miśra in the Sāṅkhya-tattva-kaumudī.
kevalā vikṛtistu viyadādīni pañca mahābhūtāni ekādaśendriyāṇi ca| taduktam - ṣoḍaśakastu vikāraḥ|	(c.) The "evolute only" means the five gross elements, ether, &c., and the eleven organs, as said in the Kārikā, "The evolute consists of sixteen;" that is, the set of sixteen is evolute only, and not evolvent.
ṣoḍaśasaṃkhyāvacchinno gaṇaḥ ṣoḍaśako vikāra eva na prakṛtirityarthaḥ| yadyapi pṛthivyādayo goghaṭādīnāṃ prakṛtistathāpi na te pṛthivyādibhyastattvāntaramiti na prakṛtiḥ| tattvāntaropādānatvaṃ ceha prakṛtitvamabhimatam|	Although it may be said that earth, &c., are the evolvents of such productions as cows, jars, &c., yet these are not a different "principle" (tattva) from earth, &c., and therefore earth, &c., are not what we term "evolvents;" as the accepted idea of an evolvent is that which is the material cause of a separate principle; and in cows, jars, &c., there is the absence of being any such first principle, in consequence of their being all alike gross [i.e., possessed of dimensions] and perceptible to the senses.
goghaṭādīnāṃ sthūlatvendriyagrāhyatvayoḥ samānatvena tattvāntaratvābhāvaḥ| tatra śabdasparśarūparasagandhatanmātrebhyaḥ pūrvapūrvasūkṣmabhūtasahitebhyaḥ pañcamahābhūtāni viyadādīni krameṇaikadvitricatuṣpañcaguṇāni jāyante|	The five gross elements, ether, &c., are respectively produced from sound, touch, form, taste, and smell, each subtile element being accompanied by all those which precede it, and thus the gross elements will have respectively one, two, three, four, and five qualities.[7] The creation of the organs has been previously described.
indriyasṛṣṭistu prāgevoktā|	This is thus propounded in the Sāṅkhya Kārikā (§ 22)—
taduktam - prakṛtermahāṃstato'haṃkārastasmādgaṇaśca ṣoḍaśakaḥ| tasmādapi ṣoḍaśakātpañcabhyaḥ pañca bhūtāni||	"From nature springs the great one, from this egoism, from this the set of sixteen, and from five among the sixteen proceed the five gross elements."
anubhayātmakaḥ puruṣaḥ| taduktam - na prakṛtirna vikṛtiḥ puruṣaḥ (sāṃ.kā.3) iti| puruṣastu kūṭasthanityo'pariṇāmī na kasyacitprakṛtirnāpi vikṛtiḥ kasyacidityarthaḥ|	(d.) The soul is neither,—as is said in the Kārikā, "The soul is neither evolvent nor evolute." That is, the soul, being absolute, eternal, and subject to no development, is itself neither the evolvent nor the evolute of aught beside.
etatpañcaviṃśatitattvasādhakatvena pramāṇatrayamabhimatam|	Three kinds of proof are accepted as establishing these twenty-five principles; and thus the Kārikā (§ 4).
tadapyuktam - dṛṣṭamanumānamāptavacanaṃ ca sarvapramāṇasiddhatvāt| trividhaṃ pramāṇamiṣṭaṃ prameyasiddhiḥ pramāṇāddhi||	"Perception, inference, and the testimony of worthy persons are acknowledged to be the threefold proof, for they comprise every mode of demonstration. It is from proof that there results belief of that which is to be proven."
iha kāryakāraṇabhāve caturdhā vipratipattiḥ prasarati|	Here a fourfold discussion arises as to the true nature of cause and effect.
asataḥ sajjāyata iti saugatāḥ saṃgirante| naiyāyikādayaḥ sato'sajjāyata iti| vedāntinaḥ sato vivartaḥ kāryajātaṃ na vastu saditi| sāṃkhyāḥ punaḥ sataḥ sajjāyata iti|	The Saugatas[8] maintain that the existent is produced from the non-existent; the Naiyāyikas, &c., that the (as yet) non-existent is produced from the existent; the Vedāntins, that all effects are an illusory emanation from the existent and not themselves really existent; while the Sāṅkhyas hold that the existent is produced from the existent.
tatrāsataḥ sajjāyata iti na prāmāṇikaḥ pakṣaḥ, asato nirupākhyasya śaśaviṣāṇavat kāraṇatvānupapatteḥ, tucchātucchayostādātmyānupapatteśca|	(a.) Now the first opinion is clearly untenable, since that which is itself non-existent and unsubstantial can never be a cause any more than the hare's horn; and, again, the real and unreal can never be identical.
nāpi sato'sajjāyate, kārakavyāpārātprāgasataḥ śaśaviṣāṇavat sattāsaṃbandhalakṣaṇotpattyanupapatteḥ| na hi nīlaṃ nipuṇatamenāpi pītaṃ kartuṃ pāryate| nanu sattvāsattve ghaṭasya dharmāviti cet- tadacāru| asati dharmiṇi taddharma iti vyapadeśānupapattyā dharmiṇaḥ sattvāpatteḥ|	(b.) Nor can the non-existent be produced from the existent; since it is impossible that that which, previous to the operation of the originating cause, was as non-existent as a hare's horn should ever be produced, i.e., become connected with existence; for not even the cleverest man living can make blue yellow.[9] If you say, "But are not existence and non-existence attributes of the same jar?" this is incorrect, since we cannot use such an expression as "its quality" in regard to a non-existent subject, for it would certainly imply that the subject itself did exist.
tasmātkārakavyāpārātprāgapi kāryaṃ sadeva| sataścābhivyaktirūpapadyate yathā pīḍanena tileṣu tailasya dohanena saurabheyīṣu payasaḥ|	Hence we conclude that the effect is existent even previously to the operation of the cause, which only produces the manifestation of this already existent thing, just like the manifestation of the oil in sesame seed by pressing, or of the milk in cows by milking.
asataḥ kāraṇe kimapi nidarśanaṃ na dṛśyate|	Again, there is no example whatever to prove the production of a thing previously non-existent.
kiṃ ca kāryeṇa kāraṇaṃ saṃbaddhaṃ tajjanakamasaṃbaddhaṃ vā| prathame kāryasya sattvamāyātam, satoreva saṃbandha iti niyamāt| carame sarvaṃ kāryajātaṃ sarvasmājjāyeta, asaṃbaddhatvāviśeṣāt|	Moreover, the cause must produce its effect as being either connected with it or not connected; in the former alternative the effect's existence is settled by the rule that connection can only be between two existent things; in the latter, any and every effect might arise from any and every cause, as there is nothing to determine the action of an unconnected thing.
tadākhyāyi sāṃkhyācāryaiḥ - asattvānnāsti saṃbandhaḥ kāraṇaiḥ sattvasaṅgibhiḥ| asaṃbaddhasya cotpattimicchato na vyavasthitiḥ|| athaivamucyetāsaṃbaddhamapi tattadeva janayati yatra yacchaktam| śaktiśca kāryadarśanonneyeti|	This has been thus put by the Sāṅkhya teacher:—"From the supposed non-existence of the effect, it can have no connection with causes which always accompany existence; and to him who holds the production of a non-connected thing there arises an utter want of determinateness." If you rejoin that "the cause, though not connected with its effect, can yet produce it, where it has a capacity of so doing, and this capacity of producing is to be inferred from seeing the effect actually produced," still this cannot be allowed, since in such a case as "there is a capacity for producing oil in sesame seeds," you cannot determine, while the oil is non-existent, that there is this capacity in the sesame seeds, whichever alternative you may accept as to their being connected or not with the oil [since our before-mentioned dilemma will equally apply here].
tileṣu tailajananaśaktirityatra tailasyāsattve saṃbaddhattvāsaṃbaddhatvavikalpena tacchaktiriti nirūpaṇāyogāt| kāryakāraṇayorabhedācca kāraṇātpṛthakkāryasya sattvaṃ na bhavati| paṭastantubhyo na bhidyate taddharmatvāt| na yadevaṃ na tadevaṃ yathā gauraśvaḥ|	From our tenet that the cause and effect are identical, it follows that the effect does not exist distinct from the cause; thus the cloth is not something distinct from the threads, as it abides in the latter [as its material cause]; but where this identity is not found, there we do not find the relation of cause and effect; thus a horse and a cow are distinct from each other [for one is not produced from the other, and therefore their qualities are not the same]; but the cloth is an acknowledged effect, and therefore not anything different from its cause.[10] If you object that, if this were true, the separate threads ought to fulfil the office of clothing, we reply, that the office of clothing is fulfilled by the threads manifesting the nature of cloth when they are placed in a particular arrangement.
yathā hi kūrmasyāṅgāni kūrmaśarīre niviśamānāni tirobhavanti niḥsaranti cāvirbhavanti evaṃ kāraṇasya tantvādeḥ paṭādayo viśeṣā niḥsaranta āvirbhavanta utpadyanta ityucyante, niviśamānāstirobhavanto vinaśyantītyucyante| na punarasatāmutpattiḥ satāṃ vā vināśaḥ|	As the limbs of a tortoise when they retire within its shell are concealed, and, when they come forth, are revealed, so the particular effects, as cloth, &c., of a cause, as threads, &c., when they come forth and are revealed, are said to be produced; and when they retire and are concealed, they are said to be destroyed; but there is no such thing as the production of the non-existent or the destruction of the existent.
yathoktaṃ bhagavadgītāyām - nāsato vidyate bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ| (gī. 2/16) iti|	As has been said in the Bhagavad Gītā (ii. "There is no existence for the non-existent, nor non-existence for the existent."
śaktasya śakyakaraṇātkāraṇabhāvācca satkāryam||	And, in fact, it is by inference from its effects that we establish the existence of the great evolvent, Nature (prakṛti).
(sāṃ.kā.9) iti|	This has been said [in the Kārikā, § 9]—
nāpi sato brahmatattvasya vivartaḥ prapañcaḥ, bādhānupalambhād; adhiṣṭhānāropyayościjjaḍayoḥ kaladhautaśuktyādivat sārūpyābhāvenāropāsaṃbhavācca|	Nor can we say [with the Vedāntin] that the world is an illusory emanation from the one existent Brahman, because we have no contradictory evidence to preclude by its superior validity the primâ facie belief that the external world is real [as we have in the case of mistaking a rope for a snake, where a closer inspection will discover the error]; and again, where the subject and the attributed nature are so dissimilar as the pure intelligent Brahman and the unintelligent creation, we can no more allow the supposed attribution to be possible than in the case of gold and silver [which no one mistakes for each other].
tataśca sukhaduḥkhamohātmakasya prapañcasya tathāvidhakāraṇamavadhāraṇīyam| tathā ca prayegaḥ - vimataṃ bhāvajātaṃ sukhaduḥkhamohātmakakāraṇakaṃ tadanvitatvāt| yadyenānvīyate tattatkāraṇakaṃ yathā rūcakādikaṃ suvarṇānvitaṃ suvarṇakāraṇakam| tathā cedaṃ tasmāttatheti|	Hence we conclude that an effect which is composed of happiness, misery, and stupidity, must imply a cause similarly composed; and our argument is as follows:—The subject of the argument, viz., the external world, must have a material cause composed of happiness, misery, and stupidity, because it is itself endued therewith; whatever is endued with certain attributes must have a cause endued with the same,—thus a ring has gold for its material cause, because it has the attributes of gold; our subject is a similar case, therefore we may draw a similar conclusion.
tatra jagatkāraṇe yeyaṃ sukhātmakatā tatsattvaṃ yā duḥkhātmakatā tadrajo yā ca mohātmakatā tattama iti triguṇātmakakāraṇasiddhiḥ|	What we call "being composed of happiness" in the external world is the quality of goodness; the "being composed of misery" is the quality of activity;[12] the "being composed of stupidity" is the quality of darkness; hence we establish our cause composed of the three qualities (i.e., prakṛti, Nature).
pratyekaṃ bhāvāstraiguṇyavanto'nubhūyante| yathā maitradāreṣu satyavatyāṃ maitrasya sukhamāvirasti| taṃ prati sattvaguṇaprādurbhāvāt| tatsapatnīnāṃ duḥkham| tāḥ prati rajoguṇaprādurbhāvāt|	And we see that individual objects are found by experience to have these three qualities; thus Maitra's happiness is found in his wife Satyavatī, because the quality of "goodness" in her is manifested towards him; but she is the misery of her fellow-wives, because the quality of "activity" is manifested towards them; while she causes indifference to Caitra who does not possess her, because towards him the quality of "darkness" is manifested.
evamanyadapi ghaṭādikaṃ labhyamānaṃ sukhaṃ karoti| parairapahriyamāṇaṃ duḥkhākaroti| udāsīnasyopekṣāviṣayatvenopatiṣṭhate|	So, too, in other cases also; thus a jar, when obtained, causes us pleasure; when seized by others it causes us pain; but it is viewed with indifference by one who has no interest in it.
upekṣāviṣayatvaṃ nāma mohaḥ| muha vaicityeityasmāddhātormoha- śabdaniṣpatteḥ| upekṣaṇīyeṣu cittavṛttyanudayāt|	Now this being regarded with no interest is what we mean by "stupidity," since the word moha is derived from the root muh, "to be confused," since no direct action of the mind arises towards those objects to which it is indifferent.
tasmātsarvaṃ bhāvajātaṃ sukhaduḥkhamohātmakaṃ triguṇapradhānakāraṇakamavagamyate|	Therefore we hold that all things, being composed of pleasure, pain, and stupidity, must have as their cause Nature, which consists of the three qualities.
tathā ca śvetāśvataropaniṣadi śrūyate|	And so it is declared in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (iv.
ajāmekāṃ lohitaśuklakṛṣṇāṃ bahvīḥ prajāḥ sṛjamānāṃ sarūpāḥ| ajo hyeko juṣamāṇo'nuśete jahātyenāṃ bhuktabhogāmajo'nyaḥ||	"The one unborn, for his enjoyment, approaches the one unborn (Nature) which is red, white, and black, and produces a manifold and similar offspring; the other unborn abandons her when once she has been enjoyed."
atra lohitaśuklakṛṣṇaśabdā rañjakatvaprakāśakatvāvarakatvasādharmyād rajaḥsattvatamoguṇatraya- pratipādanaparāḥ|	Here the words "red," "white," and "black," express the qualities "activity," "goodness," and "darkness," from their severally possessing the same attributes of colouring, manifesting, and concealing.
ataḥ kenaciccetanenādhiṣṭhātrā bhavitavyam| tathā ca sarvārthadarśī parameśvaraḥ svīkattavyaḥ syāditi cet- tadasaṃgatam| acetanasyāpi pradhānasya prayojanavaśena pravṛttyupapatteḥ| dṛṣṭaṃ cācetanaṃ cetanānadhiṣṭhitaṃ puruṣārthāya pravartamānam| yathā vatsavivṛddhyarthamacetanaṃ kṣīraṃ pravartate yathā ca jalamacetanaṃ lokopakārāya pravartate tathā prakṛtiracetanāpi puruṣavimokṣāya pravartsyati|	Here, however, it may be objected, "But will not your unintelligent Nature, without the superintendence of something intelligent, fail to produce these effects, intellect, &c.? therefore there must be some intelligent superintendent; and hence we must assume an all-seeing, supreme Lord." We reply that this does not follow, since even unintelligent Nature will act under the force of an impulse; and experience shows us that an unintelligent thing, without any intelligent superintendent, does act for the good of the soul, just as the unintelligent milk acts for the growth of the calf, or just as the unintelligent rain acts for the welfare of living creatures; and so unintelligent Nature will act for the liberation of the soul.
taduktam - vatsavivṛddhinimittaṃ kṣīrasya yathā pravṛttirajñasya|	As it has been said in the Kārikā (§ 57)—
puruṣavimokṣanimittaṃ tathā pravṛttiḥ pradhānasya|| (sāṃ. kā. 57) iti|	"As the unintelligent milk acts for the nourishment of the calf, so Nature acts for the liberation of soul."
yastu parameśvaraḥ karuṇayā pravartaka iti parameśvarāstitvavādināṃ ḍiṇḍimaḥ sa garbhasrāveṇa gataḥ| vikalpānupapatteḥ|	But as for the doctrine of "a Supreme Being who acts from compassion," which has been proclaimed by beat of drum by the advocates of his existence, this has well-nigh passed away out of hearing, since the hypothesis fails to meet either of the two alternatives.
sa kiṃ sṛṣṭeḥ prākpravartate sṛṣṭyuttarakālaṃ vā? ādye śarīrādyabhāvena duḥkhānutpattau jīvānāṃ duḥkhaprahāṇecchānupapattiḥ| dvitīye parasparāśrayaprasaṅgaḥ, karuṇayā sṛṣṭiḥ sṛṣṭyā ca kāruṇyamiti|	For does he act thus before or after creation? If you say "before," we reply that as pain cannot arise in the absence of bodies, &c., there will be no need, as long as there is no creation, for his desire to free living beings from pain [which is the main characteristic of compassion]; and if you adopt the second alternative, you will be reasoning in a circle, as on the one hand you will hold that God created the world through compassion [as this is His motive in acting at all], and on the other hand[13] that He compassionated after He had created.
tasmādacetanasyāpi cetanānadhiṣṭhitasya pradhānasya mahadādirūpeṇa pariṇāmaḥ puruṣārthaprayuktaḥ pradhānapuruṣasaṃyoganimittaḥ|	Therefore we hold that the development of unintelligent Nature [even without any intelligent superintendent]—in the order of the series intellect, self-consciousness, &c.,—is caused by the union of Nature and Soul, and the moving impulse is the good of Soul.

(sāṃ. kā. 21) iti|	This has been said in the Kārikā (§ 21)—
nanu puruṣārthanibandhanā bhavatu prakṛteḥ pravṛttiḥ|	"For the soul's contemplation of Nature and for its final separation the union of both takes place, as of the lame man and the blind man.

I reply, that as a wilful woman whose faults have once been seen by her husband does not return to him, or as an actress, having performed her part, retires from the stage, so too does Nature desist.

tṛtīye 'deśabandhaścittasya dhāraṇā' (pāta.yo.sū.3/1) ityādinā dhāraṇādhyānasamādhitrayamantaraṅgaṃ saṃyamapadāvācyaṃ tadavāntaraphalaṃ vibhūtijātam|	In the third chapter, in the series commencing "Attention is the fastening [of the mind] on some spot," he expounds the three internal subservients—attention, contemplation, and meditation, collectively called by the name "subjugation" (saṃyama), and also the various superhuman powers which are their subordinate fruit.
caturthe 'janmauṣadhimantratapaḥsamādhijāḥ siddhayaḥ' (pāta. yo. sū. 4/1/) ityādinā siddhipañcakaprapañcanapuraḥsaraṃ paramaṃ prayojanaṃ kaivalyam|	In the fourth chapter, in the series commencing, "Perfections spring from birth, plants, spells, mortification, and meditation," he expounds the highest end, Emancipation, together with a detailed account of the five so-called "perfections" (siddhis).

To this we reply, that the quality Goodness develops itself as the understanding, and it is this which is, as it were, burned by the quality Activity; and the soul, by the influence of Darkness, blindly identifying itself with this suffering quality, is also said itself to suffer.
taduktamācāryaiḥ - sattvaṃ tapyaṃ buddhibhāvena vṛttaṃ bhāvā ye vā rājasāstāpakāste|	Thus the teachers have declared— "It is Goodness which suffers under the form of the understanding and the substances belonging to Activity which torment,[3]
tapyābhedagrāhiṇī tāmasī yā vṛttistasyāṃ tapya ityukta ātmā||	And it is through the modification of Darkness, as wrongly identifying, that the Soul is spoken of as suffering."

tathā śuddho'pi puruṣaḥ pratyayaṃ bauddhamanupaśyati, tamanupaśyannatadātmāpi tadātmaka iva pratibhāsata iti|	Thus the soul, though in itself pure, sees according to the idea produced by the understanding; and, while thus seeing at second-hand, though really it is different from the understanding, it appears identical therewith.

atrāthaśabdo'dhikārārthaḥ svīkriyate|	The word "now" (atha) is accepted as having here an inceptive meaning, [as intimating that a distinct topic is now commenced].

The great Canon for nouns and their gender [the Amara Koṣa Dictionary] gives many such meanings.

(interrogatively),—and all (comprehensively).' Now we willingly surrender such senses as interrogation or comprehensiveness; but since there are four senses certainly suitable, i.e., 'after,' 'an auspicious particle,' 'reference to a previous topic,' and 'the inceptive now,' there is no reason for singling out the last." This objection, however, will not stand, for it cannot bear the following alternative.
ānantaryamathaśabdārtha iti pakṣe yataḥ kutaścidānantaryaṃ pūrvavṛttaśamādyasādhāraṇāt kāraṇādānantaryaṃ vā| na prathamaḥ| na hi kaścitkṣaṇamapi jātu tiṣṭhatyakarmakṛt| (gī. 3.5) iti nyāyena sarvoṃ janturavaśyaṃ kiṃcit kṛtvā kiṃcitkarotyeveti tasyābhidhānamantareṇāpi prāptatayā tadarthāthaśabdaprayogavaiyarthyaprasakteḥ|	If you maintain the sense of "after," then do you hold that it implies following after anything whatever, or only after some definite cause as comprehended under the general definition of causation,[5] i.e., "previous existence [relatively to the effect]"? It cannot be the former, for, in accordance with the proverb that "No one stands for a single moment inactive," everybody must always do everything after previously doing something else; and since this is at once understood without any direct mention at all, there could be no use in employing the particle atha to convey this meaning.
śamādyanantaraṃ yogasya pravṛttāvapi tasyānuśāsanapravṛtyanubandhatvenopāttatayā śabdataḥ prādhānyābhāvāt| na ca śabdataḥ pradhānabhūtasyānuśāsanasya śamādyānantaryamathaśabdārthaḥ kiṃ na syāditi vaditavyam|	Nor can it be the latter alternative; because, although we fully grant that the practice of concentration does in point of fact follow after previous tranquillity, &c., yet these are rather the necessary preliminaries to the work of exposition, and consequently cannot have that avowed predominance [which the presumed cause should have].
anuśiṣyate vyākhyāyate lakṣaṇabhedopāyaphalasahito yogo yena tadanuśāsanamiti vyutpatteḥ| anuśāsanasya ca tattvajñānacikhyāpayiṣānantarabhāvitvena śamadamādyānantaryaniyamābhāvāt|	Still [however we may settle these points] the question arises, Is the exposition of the yoga ascertained to be a cause of final beatitude or not? If it is, then it is still a desirable object, even if certain presupposed conditions should be absent; and if it is not, then it must be undesirable, whatever conditions may be present.[7] But it is clear that the exposition in question is such a cause, since we have such a passage of the Śruti as that [in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad, ii.
jijñāsājñānayostu śamādyānantaryamāmnāyate- 'tasmācchānto dānta uparatastitikṣuḥ samāhito bhūtvātmanyevātmānaṃ paśyet' (bṛ.4/4/23) ityādinā| nāpi tattvajñānacikhyāpayiṣānantaryamathaśabdārthaḥ| tasya saṃbhave'pi śrotṛpratipattipravṛttyoranupayoge- nānabhidheyatvāt| tavāpi niḥśreyasahetutayā yogānuśāsanaṃ pramitaṃ na vā|	12]: "By the acquirement of yoga or intense concentration on the Supreme Soul, the wise man having meditated leaves behind joy and sorrow;" and again, such a passage of the Smṛti as that [in the Bhagavad Gītā, ii. 53]: "The intellect unwavering in contemplation will then attain yoga." Hence we conclude that it is untenable to interpret atha as implying that the exposition must follow "after" a previous inquiry on the part of the student, or "after" a previous course of ascetic training and use of elixirs, &c.
ādye tadabhāve'pyupādeyatvaṃ bhavet|	[to render the body strong].

atha mā nāma bhūdānantaryārtho'thaśabdaḥ| maṅgalārthaḥ kiṃ na syāt? na syāt maṅgalasya vākyārthe samanvayābhāvāt| agarhitābhīṣṭāvāptirmaṅgalam|	"Well, then, let us grant that atha cannot mean 'after;' but why should it not be simply an auspicious particle?" But this it cannot be, from the absence of any connection between the context and such auspicious meaning.
abhīṣṭaṃ ca sukhāvāptiduḥkhaparihārarūpatayeṣṭam| yogānuśāsanasya ca sukhaduḥkhanivṛttyoranyataratvābhāvānna maṅgalatā| tathā ca yogānuśāsanaṃ maṅgalamiti na saṃpanīpadyate, mṛdaṅgadhvanerivāthaśabdaśravaṇasya kāryatayā maṅgalasya vācyatvalakṣyatvayorasaṃbhavācca| yathārthikārthoṃ vākyārthe na niviśate tathā kāryamapi na niviśeta|	Auspiciousness implies the obtaining of an unimpeached and desired good, and what is desired is so desired as being the attainment of pleasure or the avoidance of pain; but this auspiciousness cannot belong to the exposition of yoga, since it is in itself neither pleasure nor the cessation of pain.[9] Therefore it cannot be at all established that the meaning of the aphorism is that "the exposition of the yoga is auspicious;" for auspiciousness cannot be either the primary meaning of atha or its secondary meaning by metonymy, since it is its very sound which is in itself auspicious [without any reference to the meaning], like that of a drum.
apadārthatvāviśeṣāt| padārtha eva hi vākyārthe samanvīyate| anyathā śabdapramāṇakānāṃ 'śābdī hyākāṅkṣā śabdenaiva pūryata' iti mudrābhaṅgaḥ kṛto bhavet|	"But why not say that just as an implied meaning may enter into the direct meaning of a sentence, so an effect [like this of auspiciousness] may also be included, since both are equally unexpressed so far as the actual words are concerned?"[10] We reply, that in the meaning of a sentence the connection must be between the meaning of one word and that of another; otherwise we should be guilty of breaking the seal which the rule of the grammarians has set, that "verbal expectancy[11] can be fulfilled by words alone."
nanu prāripsitaprabandha- parisamāptiparipanthipratyūhavyūhapraśamanāya śiṣṭācāra paripālanāya ca śāstrārambhe maṅgalācaraṇamanuṣṭeyam| 'maṅgalādīni maṅgalamadhyāni maṅgalāntāni ca śāstrāṇi prathante, āyuṣmatpuruṣakāṇi vīrapuruṣakāṇi ca bhavanti' (pāta.mā.bhā. 1/3/1) ityabhiyuktokteḥ|	"But ought not a prayer for an auspicious commencement to be put at the beginning of a Śāstra, in order to lay the hosts of obstacles that would hinder the completion of the work which the author desires to begin, and also to observe the immemorial practice of the good, since it has been said by the wise, 'Those śāstras become widely famous which have auspicious commencements, auspicious middles, and auspicious endings, and their students have long lives and are invincible in disputation'?[12] Now the word atha implies 'auspiciousness,' since there is a Smṛti which says,
bhavati ca maṅgalārtho'thaśabdaḥ- 'oṃkāraścāthaśabdaśca dvāvetau brahmaṇaḥ purā|	"'The word Om and the word atha,—these two in the ancient time, "'Cleaving the throat of Brahman, came forth; therefore they are both auspicious.'
tathā ca 'vṛddhirādaic' ( pā.sū.1/1/1) ityādau vṛddhayādiśabdavadathaśabdo maṅgalārthaḥ syāditi cet- maivaṃ bhāṣiṣṭhāḥ| arthāntarābhidhānāya prayuktasyāthaśabdasya vīṇāveṇvādidhvanivacchravaṇamātreṇa maṅgalaphalatvopapatteḥ|	"Therefore let the word atha stand here as signifying 'auspiciousness,' like the word 'vṛddhi' used by Pāṇini in his opening sūtra 'vṛddhir ād aich.'"[13] This view, however, is untenable; since the very word atha, when heard, has an auspicious influence, even though it be employed to convey some other special signification, just as the hearing the sound of lutes, flutes, &c.
athārthāntarārambhavākyārthadhīphalaka- syāthaśabdasya kathamanyaphalakateti cenna| anyārthaṃ nīyamānodaku mbhopalambhavattatsaṃbhavāt| na ca smṛtivyākopaḥ|	If you still object, "How can the particle atha have any other effect, if it is specially used here to produce the idea that the meaning of the sentence is that a new topic is commenced?" we reply that it certainly can have such other additional effect, just as we see that jars of water brought for some other purpose are auspicious omens at the commencement of a journey.[14] Nor does this contradict the smṛti, since the smṛti will still hold good, as the words "they are both auspicious" mean only that they produce an auspicious effect.
māṅgalikāviti maṅgalaprayojanatvavivakṣayā pravṛtteḥ| nāpi pūrvaprakṛtāpekṣothaśabdaḥ|	Nor can the particle atha have here the meaning of "reference to a previous topic," since the previously mentioned faults will all equally apply here, as this meaning really involves that of "after" [which we have already discussed and rejected].
phalata ānantaryāvyatirekeṇa prāguktadūṣaṇānuṣaṅgāt| kimaya- mathaśabdo'dhikārārtho'thānantaryārtha ityādivimarśavākye pakṣāntaropanyāse tatsaṃbhave'pi prakṛte tadasaṃbhavācca|	And again, in such discussions as this, as to whether this particular atha means "the inceptive now" or "after," if another topic had been previously suggested, then "reference thereto" would be a possible meaning; but in the present case [where no other topic has been previously suggested] it is not a possible meaning.
tasmātpāriśeṣyādadhikārapadavedanīyaprārambhārtho'thaśabda iti viśeṣo bhāṣyate|	Therefore, by exhaustion, the commentator finally adopts, for the atha of the sūtra, the remaining meaning of "the inceptive now." So, when it is said [in the Tāṇḍya Brāhmaṇa, xvi.
yathā 'athaiṣa jyotirathaiṣa viśvajyotiḥ' ityatrāthaśabdaḥ krataviśeṣaprārambhārthaḥ parigṛhīto yathā ca 'atha śabdānuśāsanam ( pāta ma.bhā. 1/1) ityatrāthaśabdo vyākaraṇaśāstrādhikārarthastadvat|	10, 1], "Now this is the Jyotis," "Now this is the Viśvajyotis,"[15] the particle atha is accepted as signifying the commencement of the description of a particular sacrifice, just as the atha in the commencement of the Mahābhāshya, "now comes the exposition of words," signifies the commencement of the Institutes of Grammar.
tadabhāṣi vyāsabhāṣye yogasūtravivaraṇapare athetyayamadhikārārthaḥ prayujyata iti| tadvyācakhyau vācaspatiḥ|	This has been declared by Vyāsa in his Commentary on the Yoga Aphorisms, "the atha in this opening aphorism indicates a commencement;" and Vācaspati has similarly explained it in his gloss; therefore it may be considered as settled that the atha here indicates a commencement and also signifies auspiciousness.
tadittham- 'amuṣyāthaśabdasyādhikārārthatvapakṣe śāstreṇa prastūyamānasya yogasyopavartanātsamastaśāstratātparyārtha- vyākhyānena śiṣyasya sukhāvabodhapravṛttirbhavatītyathaśabdasyādhikārārthatvamupapannam|	Therefore, accepting the view that this atha implies a commencement, let the student be left in peace to strive after a successful understanding of the śāstra through the attainment of the yoga, which is its proposed subject, by means of the teacher's explanation of its entire purport.

We reply that it was for this reason that the venerable Patañjali,[16] that ocean of compassion, considering how difficult it was to grasp all the different forms of Yoga scattered up and down in the Purāṇas, &c., and wishing to collect together their essence, commenced his anuśāsana,—the preposition anu implying that it was a teaching which followed a primary revelation and was not itself the immediate origin of the system.
yadāyamathaśabdo'dhikārārtha- stadaivaṃ vākyārthaḥ saṃpadyate - yogānuśāsanaṃ śāstramadhikṛtaṃ veditavyamiti| tasmādayamathaśabdo- dhikāradyotako maṅgalārthaśceti siddham| tatra śāstre vyutpādyamānatayā yogaḥ sasādhanaḥ saphalo viṣayaḥ| tadvyutpādanamavāntaraphalam| vyutpāditasya yogasya kaivalyaṃ paramaprayojanam|	Since this atha in the aphorism signifies "commencement," the full meaning of the sentence comes out as follows: "be it known that the institute for the exposition of the yoga is now commenced." In this institute the "object-matter," as being that which is produced by it, is yoga [or the "concentration of the mind"], with its means and its fruit; the producing this is its inferior "end;" supreme absorption (kaivalya) is the highest "end" of the yoga when it is produced.
śāstrayogayoḥ pratipādyapratipādakabhāvalakṣaṇaḥ saṃbandhaḥ| yogasya kaivalyasya ca sādhyasādhanabhāvalakṣaṇaḥ saṃbandhaḥ|	The "connection" between the institute and yoga is that of the producer and the thing to be produced; the "connection" between yoga and supreme absorption is that of the means and the end; and this is well known from Śruti and Smṛti, as I have before shown.
sa ca śrutyādiprasiddha iti prāgevāvādiṣam| mokṣamapekṣamāṇā evādhikāriṇa ityarthasiddham|	And it is established by the general context that those who aim at liberation are the duly qualified persons to hear this institute.
na ca 'athāto brahmajijñāsā' (bra.sū.1/1/1) ityādāvadhikāriṇorthataḥ siddhirāśaṅkanīyā|	Nor need any one be alarmed lest a similar course should be adopted with the opening aphorism of the Vedānta sūtras, "Now, therefore, there is a wish to know Brahman;" and lest here, too, we should seek to establish by the general context that all persons who aim at liberation are duly qualified students of the Vedānta.
tatrāthaśabdenānantaryābhidhāna- praṇāḍikayā'dhikārisamarpaṇasiddhāvārthikatva-śaṅkānudayāt|	For the word atha, as there used, signifies "succession" [or "after"]; and it is a settled point that the doctrine can only be transmitted through a regular channel to duly qualified students, and consequently the question cannot arise as to whether any other meaning is suggested by the context.
ata evoktaṃ 'śrutiprāpte prakaraṇādīnāmanavakāśaḥ' iti| asyārthaḥ - yatra hi śrutyārthoṃ na labhyate tatraiva prakaraṇādayo'rthaṃ samarpayanti, netaratra| yatra tu śabdādevārthasyopalambhastatra netarasya saṃbhavaḥ| śīghrabodhinyā śrutyā viniyogasya bodhanena nirākāṅkṣatayetareṣāmanavakāśāt|	Hence it has been said, "When Śruti comes [as the determining authority] 'the subject-matter' and the rest have no place."[17] The full meaning of this is as follows: Where a thing is not apprehended from the Veda itself, there the "subject-matter" and the rest can establish the true meaning, not otherwise; but wherever we can attain the meaning by a direct text, there the other modes of interpretation are irrelevant.
kiṃ ca, śrutyā bodhite'rthaṃ tadviruddhārthe prakaraṇādi samarpayatyaviruddhaṃ vā? na prathamaḥ, viruddhārthabodhakasya tasya bādhitatvat|	For when a thing is declared by a text of the Veda which makes its meaning obvious at once, the "subject-matter" and the rest either establish a contrary conclusion or one not contrary.

taduktaṃ bhagavatā vyāsena - (yogabhā 1/1/) yogaḥ samādhiriti|	It has been thus summed up—

This, however, we do not allow; because we maintain that these various modifications which are to be hindered,[25] such as "right notion," "misconception," "fancy," "sleep," and "memory" (i.
kūṭasthanityā cicchaktirapariṇāminī vijñānadharmāśrayo bhavituṃ nārhatyeva|	6), are attributes of the internal organ (citta), since the power of pure intelligence, which is unchangeable, cannot become the site of this discriminative perception.

tathā yadyasau puruṣaḥ pariṇāmī syāttadā pariṇāmasya kādācitkatvāt tāsāṃ cittavṛttīnāṃ sadā jñātatvaṃ nopapadyeta|	And so again, if this soul were susceptible of change, then, as this change would be occasional, we could not predicate its always knowing these modifications.

We reply that even although we grant that they are all-pervading, it is only where a given understanding has certain modifications in a given body, and certain objects are in a connection with that body, that the knowledge of these objects only, and none other, is produced to that understanding; and therefore, as this limitation is absolute, we hold that objects are just like magnets, and affect the understanding just as these do iron,—coming in contact with it through the channels of the senses.

Moreover, the sage Pañcaśikha declared the unchangeable nature of the intelligent soul, "The power that enjoys is unchangeable;" and so Patañjali also (iv.
patañjalināpi - 'sadā jñātāścittavṛttayastatprabhoḥ puruṣasyāpariṇāmitvāt' (pāta.yo.sū. 4/18) iti|	18), "The modifications of the understanding are always known,—this arises from the unchangeableness of the Ruling Soul." The following is the argument drawn out formally to establish the changeableness of the understanding.
cittapariṇāmitve'numānamucyate - cittaṃ pariṇāmi jñātājñātaviṣayatvāt śrotrādivaditi|	The understanding is susceptible of change because its various objects are now known and now not known, just like the organ of hearing and the other organs of sense.

When the subject, the understanding, perceives the colour "blue," &c., there is a change of "property" just as when the substance "gold" becomes a bracelet, a diadem, or an armlet; there is a change of "aspect" when the property becomes present, past, or future; and there is a change of "condition" when there is a manifestation or non-manifestation[30] of the perception, as of blue, &c.; or, in the case of gold, the [relative] newness or oldness [at two different moments] would be its change of condition.
evamanyatrāpi yathāsaṃbhavaṃ pariṇāmatritayamūhanīyam|	These three kinds of change must be traced out by the reader for himself in different other cases.
tathā ca pramāṇadivṛttīnāṃ cittadharmatvātta- nnirodhopi tadāśraya eveti na kiṃcidanupapannam|	And thus we conclude that there is nothing inconsistent in our thesis that, since "right notion" and the other modifications are attributes of the understanding, their "suppression" will also have its site in the same organ.
nanu vṛttinirodho yoga ityaṅgīkāre suṣuptayādau kṣiptamūḍhādicittavṛttīnāṃ nirodhasaṃbhavādyogatvaprasaṅgaḥ| na caitadyujyate, kṣiptādyavasthāsu kleśaprahāṇāderasaṃbhavānniḥ- śreyasaparipanthitvācca|	[Our opponent now urges a fresh and long objection to what we have said above.] "But if we accept your definition that 'yoga is the suppression of the modifications of the citta,' this will apply also to 'sound sleep,' since there too we may find the suppression [or suspension] of the modifications found in kṣipta, vikṣipta, mūḍha,[31] &c.; but this would be wrong, because it is impossible for the 'afflictions' to be abolished so long as those states called kṣipta, &c., remain at all, and because they only hinder the attainment of the summum bonum.
tathā hi- kṣiptaṃ nāma teṣu teṣu viṣayeṣu kṣipyamāṇamasthiraṃ cittamucyate|	For the understanding is called kṣipta, 'restless,' when it is restless [with an excess of the quality rajas], as being tossed about amidst various objects which engage it.
tamaḥsamudre magnaṃ nidrāvṛttibhāvitaṃ mūḍhamiti gīyate| kṣiptādviśiṣṭaṃ cittaṃ vikṣiptamiti gīyate|	It is called mūḍha, 'blinded,' when it is possessed by the modification 'sleep' and is sunk in a sea of darkness [owing to an excess of the quality tamas].

tadāha- 'vyādhistyānasaṃśayapramādālasyāviratibhrāntidarśanālabdha- bhūmikatvānavasthitatvāni cittavikṣepāste'ntarāyāḥ' (pāta. yo. sū.1/30) iti| tatra doṣatrayavaiṣamyanimitto jvarādirvyādhiḥ| cittasyākarmaṇyatvaṃ styānam| viruddhakoṭidvayāvagāhi jñānaṃ saṃśayaḥ| samādhisādhanānāmabhāvanaṃ pramādaḥ|	30], 'Sickness, languor, doubt, carelessness, laziness, addiction to objects, erroneous perception, failure to attain some stage, and instability,—these distractions of the mind are called "obstacles".' Here 'sickness' means fever, &c., caused by the want of equilibrium between the three humours; 'languor' is the mind's want of activity; 'doubt' is a sort of notion which embraces two opposite alternatives; 'carelessness' is a negligence of using the means for producing meditation; 'laziness' is a want of exertion from heaviness of body, speech, or mind; 'addiction to objects' is an attachment to objects of sense; 'erroneous perception' is a mistaken notion of one thing for another; 'failure to attain some stage' is the failing for some reason or other to arrive at the state of abstract meditation; 'instability' is the mind's failure to continue there, even when the state of abstract meditation has been reached.
śarīravākcittagurutvādapravṛttirālasyam|	Therefore we maintain that the suppression of the mind's modifications cannot be laid down as the definition of yoga.

ekatānaṃ cittamekāgramucyate| niruddhasakalavṛttikaṃ saṃskāramātraśeṣaṃ cittaṃ niruddhamiti bhaṇyate|	Now by ekāgra we mean that state when the mind, entirely filled with the sattva quality, is devoted to the one object of meditation; and by niruddha we mean that state when all its developments are stopped, and only their latent impressions [or potentialities] remain.
sa ca samādhirddhividhaḥ| saṃprajñātāsaṃprajñātabhedāt|	Now this samādhi, "meditation" [in the highest sense], is twofold: "that in which there is distinct recognition" (saṃprajñāta), and "that in which distinct recognition is lost" (asaṃprajñāta) [Yoga S., i.
tatraikāgracetasi yaḥ pramāṇādivṛttīnāṃ bāhyaviṣayāṇāṃ nirodhaḥ sa saṃprajñātaḥ samādhiḥ, samyakprajñāyate'sminprakṛterviviktatayā dhyeyamiti vyutpatteḥ|	17, 18].[33] The former is defined as that meditation where the thought is intent on its own object, and all the "modifications," such as "right notion," &c., so far as they depend on external things, are suppressed, or, according to the etymology of the term, it is where the intellect[34] is thoroughly recognised (samyak prajñāyate) as distinct from Nature.
sa caturvidhaḥ savitarkādibhedāt|	It has a fourfold division, as savitarka, savicāra, sānanda, and sāsmita.
samādhirnāma bhāvanā| sā ca bhāvyasya viṣayāntaraparihāreṇa cetasi punaḥ punarniveśanam|	Now this "meditation" is a kind of "pondering" (bhāvanā), which is the taking into the mind again and again, to the exclusion of all other objects, that which is to be pondered.
bhāvyaṃ ca dvividham- īśvarastattvāni ca|	And that which is thus to be pondered is of two kinds, being either Īśvara or the twenty-five principles.
tānyapi dvividhāni jaḍājaḍabhedāt|	And these principles also are of two kinds—senseless and not senseless.
jaḍāni prakṛtimahadahaṃkārādīni caturviṃśatiḥ| ajaḍaḥ puruṣaḥ|	Twenty-four, including nature, intellect, egoism, &c., are senseless; that which is not senseless is Soul.

yadā rajastamoleśānuviddhaṃ cittaṃ bhāvyate tadā sukhaprakāśamayasya sattvasyodrekātsānandaḥ| yadā rajastamoleśānabhibhūtaṃ śuddhaṃ sattvamālambanīkṛtya yā pravartate bhāvanā tadā tasyāṃ sattvasya nyagbhāvāccitiśakterudrekācca sattāmātrāvaśeṣatvena sāsmitaḥ samādhiḥ| taduktaṃ 'patañjalināvitarka vicārānandāsmitārupānugamātsaṃprajñātaḥ|' (pāta. yo. sū. 1/17) iti|	When the mind, commingled with some "passion" and "darkness," is pondered, then the meditation is called "beatific" (sānanda), because "goodness" is then predominant, which consists in the manifestation of joy.[36] When pondering is pursued, having as its object the pure element of "goodness," unaffected by even a little of "passion" or "darkness," then that meditation is called "egoistical" (sāsmita), because here personal existence[37] only remains, since the intellectual faculty becomes now predominant, and the quality of "goodness" has become quite subordinate [as a mere stepping-stone to higher things].
sarvavṛttinirodhe tvasaṃprajñātaḥ samādhiḥ|	But the "meditation, where distinct recognition is lost," consists in the suppression of all "modifications" whatever.
nanu sarvavṛttinirodho yoga ityukte saṃprajñāte vyāptirna syāt tatra sattvapradhānāyāḥ sattvapuruṣānyatākhyātilakṣaṇāyāṃ vṛtteranirodhāditi cet - tadetadvārtam, kleśakarmavipākāśayaparipanthicittavṛttinirodho yoga ityaṅgīkārāt|	"But" [it may be asked] "was not 'concentration' defined as the suppression of all the modifications? How, then, can the 'meditation where there is distinct recognition' be included in it at all, since we still find active in it that modification of the mind, with the quality of goodness predominant, which views the soul and the quality of goodness as distinct from each other?" This, however, is untenable, because we maintain that concentration is the suppression of the "modifications" of the thinking power, as especially stopping the operation of the "afflictions," the "actions," the "fructifications," and the "stock of deserts."[38]
kleśāḥ punaḥ pañcadhā prasiddhāḥ avidyāsmitārāgadveṣābhiniveśāḥ kleśāḥ (pāta.yo.sū.2/3)iti|	The "afflictions" (kleśa) are well known as five, viz., ignorance, egoism, desire, aversion, and tenacity of mundane existence.

Is it to be considered as an avyayībhāva compound, where the former portion is predominant, as in the word "above-board"?[39] or is it a tatpuruṣa [or karmadhāraya] compound, where the latter portion is predominant, as in the word "town-clerk"? or is it a bahuvrīhi compound, where both portions are dependent on something external to the compound, as "blue-eyed"? It cannot be the first; for if the former portion of the compound were predominant, then we should have the negation the emphatic part in avidyā (i.e., it would be an instance of what is called the express negation, or prasajya-pratishedha);[40] and consequently, as avidyā would be thus emphatically a negation, it would be unable to produce positive results, as the "afflictions," &c., and the very form of the word should not be feminine, but neuter.
na dvitīyaḥ kasyacidabhāvena viśiṣṭāyā vidyāyāḥ kleśādiparipanthitvena tadbījatvānupapatteḥ|	It cannot be the second; for any knowledge, whatever thing's absence it may be characterised by (a + vidyā), opposes the "afflictions," &c., and cannot therefore be their source.

But this explanation is untenable; for such an avidyā could not become the source of the "afflictions;"[43] and yet, on the other hand, it ought to be their source,[44] even though it were associated with the suppression of all the "modifications,"[45] and were also accompanied by that discriminative knowledge of the soul and the quality of goodness [which is found in the sāsmita meditation].
tanutvaṃ pratipakṣabhāvanayā śithilīkaraṇam|	Now it is said [in the Yoga Sūtras, ii.
vicchinnatvaṃ balavatā kleśenābhibhavaḥ| udāratvaṃ sahakāri saṃnidhivaśātkāryakāritvam|	4], "Ignorance is the field [or place of origin, i.e., source] of the others, whether they be dormant, extenuated, intercepted, or simple." They are said to be "dormant" when they are not manifested for want of something to wake them up; they are called "extenuated" when, through one's meditating on something that is opposed to them, they are rendered inert; they are called "intercepted" when they are overpowered by some other strong "affliction;" they are called "simple" when they produce their several effects in the direct vicinity of what co-operates with them.
taduktaṃ vācaspatimiśreṇa vyāsabhāṣyavyākhyāyām- 'prasuptāstattvalīnānāṃ tanvavasthāśca yoginām|	This has been expressed by Vācaspati Miśra, in his Gloss on Vyāsa's Commentary, in the following memorial stanza:—
vicchinnodārarupāśca kleśā viṣayasaṅginām||' iti|	"The dormant 'afflictions' are found in those souls which are absorbed in the tattvas [i.e., not embodied, but existing in an interval of mundane destruction]; the 'extenuated'[46] are found in yogins; but the 'intercepted' and the 'simple' in those who are in contact with worldly objects."
dvandvavatsvatantrapadārthadvayānavagamādubhayapadārthapradhānatvaṃ nāśaṅkitam|	"No one proposes the fourth solution of the compound avidyā as a dvandva compound,[47] where both portions are equally predominant, because we cannot recognise here two equally independent subjects.

[We do not, however, concede this objector's view], because we may have recourse to the other kind of negation called paryudāsa [where the affirmative part is emphatic], and maintain that avidyā means a contradictory [or wrong] kind of knowledge, the reverse of vidyā; and so it has been accepted by ancient writers.
tadāha- 'nāmadhātvarthayoge tu naiva nañ pratiṣedhakaḥ| vadatyabrāhmaṇādharmāvanyamātravirodhinau||' iti|	"The particle implying 'negation' does not signify 'absence' [or 'non-existence'] when connected with a noun or a root; thus the words abrāhmaṇa and adharma respectively signify, 'what is other than a Brāhman' and 'what is contrary to justice.'"
'vṛddhaprayogagamyo hi śabdārthaḥ sarva eva naḥ| tena yatra prayukto yo na tasmādapanīyate||' iti|	"We are to learn all the uses of words from the custom of the ancient writers; therefore a word must not be wrested from the use in which it has been already employed."

- sthānādvījādapaṣṭambhānniṣyandānnidhanādupi| kāyamādheyaśaucatvātpaṇḍitā hyaśuciṃ viduḥ || 'pariṇāmatāpasaṃskāraduḥkhairguṇavṛttyavirodhācca duḥkhameva sarvaṃ vivekinaḥ' (pāta. yo. sū. 2/15) iti nyāyena duḥkhe srakcandanavanitādau sukhatvāropaḥ|	15), "To the discriminating everything is simply pain, through the pain which arises in the ultimate issue of everything,[54] or through the anxiety to secure it [while it is enjoyed], or through the latent impressions which it leaves behind, and also from the mutual opposition of the influences of the three qualities" [in the form of pleasure, pain, and stupid indifference],—ignorance transfers the idea of "pleasure" to what is really "pain," as, e.g., garlands, sandal-wood, women, &c.; and similarly it conceives the "non-soul," e.g., the body, &c., as the "soul." As it has been said—
anātmani dehādāvātmabuddhiḥ| taduktam - anātmani ca dehādāvātmabuddhistu dehinām|	"But ignorance is when living beings transfer the notion of 'soul' to the 'non-soul,' as the body, &c.;
avidyā tatkṛto bandhastannāśo mokṣa ucyate||	"This causes bondage; but in the abolition thereof is liberation."
evamiyamavidyā catuṣpadā bhavati|	Thus this ignorance consists of four kinds.[55]

For thus it has been said by Bhaṭṭa Kumārila—
na śakyaṃ kevalaṃ vaktumato'pyasya na vācyatā||	"'Without some general definition, a more special definition cannot be given by itself; therefore it must not be even mentioned here.'"
tadapi na vācyam| atasmiṃstadbuddhiriti sāmānyalakṣaṇābhidhānena dattottaratvāt|	This, however, must not be urged here, as it is sufficiently met by the general definition of misconception, already adduced above, as "the imagining of a thing in its opposite."
sattvapuruṣayorahamasmītyekatābhimāno'smitā|	"Egoism" (asmitā) is the notion that the two separate things, the soul and the quality of purity,[56] are one and the same, as is said (ii.
tadapyuktaṃ -'dṛgdarśanaśaktyorekātmatevāsmitā' (pāta.yo.sū.2/6) iti| sukhābhijñasya sukhānusmṛtipūrvakaḥ sukhasādhaneṣu tṛṣṇārūpo gardhoṃ rāgaḥ|	6), "Egoism is the identifying of the seer with the power of sight." "Desire" (rāga) is a longing, in the shape of a thirst, for the means of enjoyment, preceded by the remembrance of enjoyment, on the part of one who has known joy.
duḥkhābhijñasya tadanusmṛtipurassaraṃ tatsādhaneṣu nivṛttirdveṣaḥ|	"Aversion" (dveṣa) is the feeling of blame felt towards the means of pain, similarly preceded by the remembrance of pain, on the part of one who has known it.
taduktaṃ - 'sukhānuśayī rāgaḥ' (pāta.yo.sū.2/7) 'duḥkhānuśayī dveṣaḥ' (pāta.yo.sū.2/8) iti|	This is expressed in the two aphorisms, "Desire is what dwells on pleasure;" "Aversion is what dwells on pain" (ii.

It cannot be the former, since the affix ṇini cannot be used after a root compounded with a preposition as anuśī; for, as the word supi has already occurred in the Sūtra, iii.
yathākathaṃcittadaṅgīkāre'pi 'aco ñṇiti' (pā.sū.7/2/115) iti vṛddhiprasaktāvatiśāyyādipadavadanuśāyipadasya prayogaprasaṅgāt|	2, 115, acho ñṇiti,[58] that the radical vowel must be subject to vṛddhi, and so the word must be anuśāyin, in accordance with the analogy of such words as atiśāyin, &c.
na dvitīyaḥ 'ekākṣarātkṛto jāteḥ saptamyāṃ ca na tau smṛtau' iti tatpratiṣedhāt, atra cānuśayaśabdasyājantatvena kṛdantatvāt|	'These two affixes[60] are not used after a monosyllable nor a kṛt formation, nor a word meaning 'genus,' nor with a word in the locative case;'
tasmādanuśayiśabdo darupapāda iti cet- naitadbhadram, bhāvānavabodhāt|	and the word anuśaya is clearly a kṛt formation as it ends with the affix ach[61] [which brings it under this prohibition, and so renders it insusceptible of the affix ini].
prāyikābhiprāyamidaṃ vacanam|	Hence the author of the Vṛtti has said—
ata evoktaṃ vṛttikāreṇa - 'itikaraṇo vivakṣārthaḥ sarvatrābhisaṃbadhyate' iti|	"The word iti, as implying the idea of popular acceptation, is everywhere connected with the examples of this rule[63] [i.e., it is not an absolute law]."
tena kvacidbhavati kāryī kāryikastaṇḍulī taṇḍulikaḥ iti|	Therefore, sometimes the prohibited cases are found, as kāryin, kāryika [where the affixes are added after a kṛt formation], taṇḍulin, taṇḍulika [where they are added after a word meaning "genus"].
tathā ca kṛdantājjāteścapratiṣedhasya prāyikatvam| anuśayaśabdasya kṛdantatayenerupapattiriti siddham|	Hence the prohibition is only general, not absolute, after kṛt formations and words meaning "genus," and therefore the use of the affix ini is justified, although the word anuśaya is formed by a kṛt affix.

This is declared in the aphorism, "Tenacity of mundane existence, flowing on through its own nature, is notorious even in the case of the philosopher" [ii.
te cāvidyādayaḥ pañca sāṃsārikavividhaduḥkhopahārahetutvena puruṣaṃ kliśnantīti kleśāḥ prasiddhāḥ|	These five, "ignorance," &c., are well known as the "afflictions" (kleśa), since they afflict the soul, as bringing upon it various mundane troubles.
karmāṇi vihitapratiṣiddharūpāṇi jyotiṣṭomabrahmahatyādīni|	[We next describe the karmāśaya of ii. 12, the "stock of works" or "merits" in the mind.] "Works" (karman) consist of enjoined or forbidden actions, as the jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice, brāhmanicide, &c.
vipākāḥ karmaphalāni jātyāyurbhoṃgāḥ| ā phalavipākāccittabhūmau śerata ityāśayā dharmādharmasaṃskārāḥ|	"Stock" (āśaya) is the balance of the fruits of previous works, which lie stored up in the mind in the form of "mental deposits" of merit or demerit, until they ripen in the individual soul's own experience as "rank," "years," and "enjoyment" [ii.
tatparipanthicittāvṛttinirodho yogaḥ|	Now "concentration" [yoga] consists [by i.

'abhyāsavairāgyābhyāṃ vṛttinirodhaḥ| tatra sthitau yatno'bhyāsaḥ'|	"Exercise is the repeated effort that the internal organ shall remain in its proper state" [i.

'dṛṣṭānuśravikaviṣayavitṛṣṇasya vaśīkārasaṃjñā vairāgyam ( pāta. yo. sū. 1/15)|	The locative case, sthitau, in the aphorism is intended to express the object or aim, as in the well-known phrase, "He kills the elephant for its skin."[66] "Dispassion is the consciousness of having overcome desire in him who thirsts after neither the objects that are seen nor those that are heard of in revelation" [i.
aihikapāratrikaviṣayādau doṣadarśanānnirabhilāṣasya 'mamaite viṣayā vaśyāḥ' 'nāhameteṣāṃ vaśyaḥ' iti vimarśoṃ vairāgyamityuktaṃ bhavati|	"Dispassion" is thus the reflection, "These objects are subject to me, not I to them," in one who feels no interest in the things of this world or the next, from perceiving the imperfections attached to them.

taduktaṃ bhagavatā - 'ārurukṣormuneryoṃgaṃ karma kāraṇamucyate|	This has been said by Kṛṣṇa in the Bhagavad Gītā [vi. "Action is the means to the sage who wishes to rise to yoga;
yogāruḍhasya tasyaiva śamaḥ kāraṇamucyate||' (bha.gī.6/3) iti|	But to him who has risen to it, tranquillity is said to be the means."
kriyāyogaścopadiṣṭaḥ patañjalinā- 'tapaḥsvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni kriyāyogaḥ' (pāta. yo. sū 2/1) iti|	Patañjali has thus defined the practical yoga: "Practical concentration is mortification, recitation of texts, and resignation to the Lord" [ii.
śeṣe yajuḥśabdaḥ (jai.sū.2/1/33-35) iti|	Yājñavalkya has described "mortification"—

tarpaṇaṃ dīpanaṃ gaptirdaśaitā mantrasaṃskriyāḥ|	"The 'satisfying,' the 'illumining,' the 'concealing,'—these are the ten consecrations of mantras.
mantrāṇāṃ mātṛkāyantrāduddhāro jananaṃ smṛtam|| praṇavāntaritānkṛtvā mantravarṇāñjapetsudhīḥ|	"The 'begetting' (janana) is the extracting of the mantra from its vowels and consonants. "The wise man should mutter the several letters of the mantra, each united to Om,
mantrārṇasaṃkhyayā taddhi jīvanaṃ saṃpracakṣate||	"According to the number of the letters. This they call the 'vivifying' (jīvana).

"The satiating libation over the mantra with mantra-hallowed water is the 'satisfying' (tarpaṇa).
japyamānasya mantrasya gopanaṃ tvaprakāśanam||	"The non-publication of the mantra which is being muttered—this is its 'concealing' (gopana).

tadalamakāṇḍatāṇḍavakalpena mantraśāstrarahasyoddhoṣaṇena|	But enough of this venturing to make public the tantra mysteries connected with mantras, which has suddenly led us astray like an unexpected Bacchanalian dance.[74]
īśvarapraṇidhānaṃ nāmābhihitānāmanabhihitānāṃ ca sarvāsāṃ kriyāṇāṃ parameśvare paramagurau phalānapekṣayā samarpaṇam|	The third form of practical yoga, "resignation to the Lord" (īśvara-praṇidhāna), is the consigning all one's works, whether mentioned or not, without regard to fruit, to the Supreme Lord, the Supremely Venerable.
yatredamuktam - kāmato'kāmato vāpi yatkaromi śubhāśubham|	As it has been said— "Whatever I do, good or bad, voluntary or involuntary,
tatsarvaṃ tvayi vinyastaṃ tvatprayuktaḥ karomyaham||	"That is all made over to thee; I act as impelled by thee."
kriyāphalasaṃnyāso'pi bhaktiviśeṣāparaparyāyaṃ praṇidhānameva phalānabhisaṃdhānena karmakāraṇāt|	This self-resignation is also sometimes defined as "the surrender of the fruits of one's actions," and is thus a peculiar kind of faith, since most men act only with a selfish regard to the fruit.
(bha.gī.2/47) iti|	Thus it is sung in the Bhagavad Gītā [ii.
anyo'rthoṃ lakṣyate yatsā lakṣaṇāropitā kriyā||	"Let thy sole concern be with action and never with the fruits;
(ta.vā.) iti| tasmādrūḍhilakṣaṇāyāḥ prayojanāpekṣā nāsti|	"Be not attracted by the fruit of the action, nor be thou attached to inaction."
tadāha patañjaliḥ- ahiṃsāsatyāsteyabrahmacaryāparigrahā yamāḥ| (pāta. yo. sū. 2/30) iti|	The harmfulness of aiming at the fruit of an action has been declared by the venerable Nīlakaṇṭha-bhāratī—

sa ca śvāsapraśvāsayorgativicchedasvarūpaḥ| tatra śvāso nāma bāhyasya vāyorantarānayanam| praśvāsaḥ punaḥ koṣṭhayasya bahirniḥsāraṇam|	Inspiration is the drawing in of the external air; expiration is the expelling of the air within the body; and "regulation of the breath" is the cessation of activity in both movements.
tayorubhayorapi saṃcaraṇābhāvaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ| nanu nedaṃ prāṇāyāmasāmānyalakṣaṇam| tadviśeṣeṣu recakapūrakakumbhakaprakāreṣu tadanugaterayogāditi cet- naiṣa doṣaḥ, sarvatrāpi śvāsapraśvāsagati- vicchedasaṃbhavāt|	"But [it may be objected] this cannot be accepted as a general definition of 'regulation of breath,' since it fails to apply to the special kinds, as rechaka, pūraka, and kumbhaka." We reply that there is here no fault in the definition, since the "cutting short of the motion of inspiration and expiration" is found in all these special kinds.
tathā hi- koṣṭhyasya vāyorbahirniḥsaraṇaṃ recakaḥ prāṇāyāmo yaḥ praśvāsatvena prāguktaḥ| bāhyasya vāyorantardhāraṇaṃ pūrako yaḥ śvāsarūpaḥ| antaḥstambhavṛttiḥ kumbhako yasmiñjalamiva kumbhe niścalatayā prāṇākhyo vāyuravasthāpyate|	Thus rechaka, which is the expulsion of the air within the body, is only that regulation of the breath, which has been mentioned before as "expiration;" and pūraka, which is the [regulated] retention of the external air within the body, is the "inspiration;" and kumbhaka is the internal suspension of breathing, when the vital air, called prāṇa, remains motionless like water in a jar (kumbha).
tatra sarvatra śvāsapraśvāsadvayagativicchedo'styeveti nāsti śaṅkāvakāśaḥ|	Thus the "cutting short of the motion of inspiration and expiration" applies to all, and consequently the objector's doubt is needless.

ata evoktaṃ mantrasamarpaṇarahasyavedibhirajapāmantrasamarpaṇe - ṣaṭśatāni gaṇeśāya ṣaṭsahasraṃ svayaṃbhuve|	Hence it has been said by those who know the secret of transmitting the mantras, concerning the transmission of the ajapāmantra[81]— "Six hundred to Gaṇeśa, six thousand to the self-existent Brahman,
viṣṇave ṣaṭsahasraṃ ca ṣaṭsahasraṃ pinākine||	"Six thousand to Viṣṇu, six thousand to Śiva,
sahasramekaṃ gurave sahasraṃ paramātmane|	"One thousand to the Guru (Bṛhaspati), one thousand to the Supreme Soul,
sahasramātmane caivamarpayāmi kṛtaṃ japam||	"And one thousand to the soul: thus I make over the performed muttering."

taduktamabhiyuktaiḥ - sārdhaṃ ghaṭīdvayaṃ nāḍyorekaikārkodayādvahet| araghaṭṭaghaṭībhrāntinyāyo nāḍyoḥ punaḥ punaḥ||	This has been thus explained by the wise— "Let each artery convey the air two ghaṭīs and a half from sunrise. "There is a continual resemblance of the two arteries[82] to the buckets on a revolving waterwheel.
śatāni tatra jāyante niśvāsocchvāsayornava| khakhaṣaṭkadvikaiḥ saṃkhyāhorātre sakale punaḥ||	"Nine hundred inspirations and expirations of the air take place [in the hour], "And all combined produce the total of twenty-one thousand six hundred in a day and night.

pratyekaṃ pañca tattvāni nāḍyośca vahamānayoḥ|	"There are five elements in each of the two conducting arteries,—
vahantyaharniśaṃ tāni jñātavyāni yatātmabhiḥ||	"They bear it along day and night; these are to be known by the self-restrained.

pravāhakālasaṃkhyeyaṃ hetustatra pradarśyate|	"This is the amount of time taken for the bearing; but the reason that the two arteries are so disturbed
pṛthvī pañcaguṇā toyaṃ caturguṇamathānalaḥ||	"Is that earth has five properties,[85] water four,

tattvābhyāṃ bhūjalābhyāṃ syācchāntiḥ kārye phalonnatiḥ|	"The two elements, earth and water, produce their fruit by the influence of 'quiet,'
dīptāsthirāvyūhavṛttistejovādyambareṣu ca|| pṛthvyaptejomarudvyomatattvānāṃ cihnamucyate|	"But fire, air, and ether by the influence of 'brightness,' 'restlessness,' and 'immensity.'[86] "The characteristic signs of earth, water, fire, air, and ether are now declared;—

śrutyoraṅguṣṭhakau madhyāṅgulyau nāsāpuṭadvaye| sṛkkiṇyoḥ prāntyakopāntyāṅgulī śeṣe dṛgantayoḥ||	"Let the devotee place his thumbs in his ears, and a middle finger in each nostril, "And the little finger and the one next to it in the corners of his mouth, and the two remaining fingers in the corners of his eyes,

yathāvadvāyutattvamavagamya tanniyamane vidhīyamāne vivekajñānāvaraṇakarmakṣayo bhavati|	When the element air is thus comprehended and its restraint is accomplished, the evil influence of works which concealed discriminating knowledge is destroyed [ii.
'tapo na paraṃ prāṇāyāmād' iti|	"There is no austerity superior to regulation of the breath."[88] And again—

tadevaṃ yamādibhiḥ saṃskṛtamanaskasya yoginaḥ saṃyamāya pratyāhāraḥ kartavyaḥ|	Now in this way, having his mind purified by the "forbearances" and the other things subservient to concentration, the devotee is to attain "self-mastery" (saṃyama)[90] and "restraint" (pratyāhāra).

indriyāṇi viṣayebhyaḥ pratīpamāhriyante'sminniti vyutpatteḥ|	This is expressed by the etymology of the word; the senses are drawn to it (ā + hṛ), away from them (pratīpa).

How, therefore, could they be accommodated to the nature of the mind?" What you say is quite true; and therefore the author of the aphorisms, having an eye to their want of power for this, introduced the words "as it were," to express "resemblance." "Restraint is, as it were, the accommodation of the senses to the nature of the mind in the absence of concernment with each one's own object" [ii.
sādṛśyaṃ ca cittānukāranimittaṃ viṣayāsaṃprayogaḥ|	Their absence of concernment with their several objects for the sake of being accommodated to the nature of the mind is this "resemblance" which we mean.

taduktaṃ viṣṇupurāṇe - śabdādiṣvanuraktāni nigṛhyākṣāṇi yogavit|	This has been declared in the Viṣṇu-purāṇa [vi. "Let the devotee, restraining his organs of sense, which ever tend to pursue external objects,

vaśīkṛtya tataḥ ku ryāccittasthānaṃ śubhāśraye||	"Let him next make the perfect asylum the dwelling-place of his mind."[93]

anyairapyuktam - tadrūpapratyayaikāgrayā saṃtatiścānyaniḥspṛhā|	Others also have said— "A continued succession of thoughts, intent on objects of that kind and desiring no other,

The Madhumatī perfection,—this is the perfection of meditation, called "the knowledge which holds to the truth," consisting in the illumination of unsullied purity by means of the contemplation of "goodness," composed of the manifestation of joy, with every trace of "passion" or "darkness" abolished by "exercise," "dispassion," &c.
taduktam - 'ṛtaṃbharā tatra prajñā' (pāta. yo. sū. 1/48) iti|	Thus it is said in the aphorisms, "In that case there is the knowledge which holds to the truth" [i.
ṛtaṃ satyaṃ bibharti kadācidapi na viparyayeṇācchādyate|	It holds "to the truth," i.e., to the real; it is never overshadowed by error.
tatra sthitau dārḍhye sati dvitīyasya yoginaḥ sā prajñā bhavatītyarthaḥ|	"In that case," i.e., when firmly established, there arises this knowledge to the second yogin.

ṛtaṃbharaprajño dvitīyaḥ| bhūtendriyajayī tṛtīyaḥ|	The madhubhūmika, who possesses the knowledge which holds to the truth; 3. The prajñājyotis, who has subdued the elements and the senses; 4.
paravairāgyasaṃpannaścaturthaḥ|	The atikrānta-bhāvanīya, who has attained the highest dispassion. ii.
manojavitvādayo madhupratīkasiddhayaḥ|	The Madhupratīkā perfections are swiftness like thought, &c.
taduktaṃ -'manojavitvaṃ vikaraṇabhāvaḥ pradhānajayaśca (pāta.yo.sū.3/48) iti|	These are declared to be "swiftness like thought, the being without organs, and the conquest of nature" [iii.

This is said in the aphorisms [i.
anyathā samīcīnaṃ rajatajñānaṃ kadācidadayamāsāduyet |	36], "Or a luminous immediate cognition, free from sorrow[101] [may produce steadiness of mind]."

"The other kind of meditation [i.e., that in which distinct recognition of an object is lost] is preceded by that exercise of thought which produces the entire cessation of modifications; it has nothing left but the latent impressions" [of thought after the departure of all objects] [i.e., saṃskāraśeṣa, i.
evaṃ grahaṇasmaraṇe api doṣavaśādvidyamānamapīdamaṃśarajatāṃśayorasaṃsarga bhedaṃ nāvagāhata iti|	Thus this foremost of men, being utterly passionless towards everything, finds that the seeds of the "afflictions," like burned rice-grains, are bereft of the power to germinate, and they are abolished together with the internal organ.

tathā hi| śuktīdamaṃśendriyasaṃprayogādidamākārāntaḥpariṇāmarūpamekaṃ jñānaṃ jāyate|	And so, too, says the Śruti, "A blind man found a jewel; one without fingers seized it; one without a neck put it on; and a dumb man praised it."[103]
