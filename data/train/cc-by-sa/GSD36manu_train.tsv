kāmajeṣu prasakto hi vyasaneṣu mahīpatiḥ / viyujyate 'rthadharmābhyāṃ krodhajeṣv ātmanaiva tu //	For a king who is attached to the vices springing from love of pleasure, loses his wealth and his virtue, but (he who is given) to those arising from anger, (loses) even his life.

utkṛṣṭāyābhirūpāya varāya sadṛśāya ca / aprāptām api tāṃ tasmai kanyāṃ dadyād yathāvidhi //	To a distinguished, handsome suitor (of) equal (caste) should (a father) give his daughter in accordance with the prescribed rule, though she have not attained (the proper age).
kāmam ā maraṇāt tiṣṭhed gṛhe kanyā rtumaty api / na caivaināṃ prayaccet tu guṇahīnāya karhi cit //	(But) the maiden, though marriageable, should rather stop in (the father's) house until death, than that he should ever give her to a man destitute of good qualities.

But he who takes (to wife) a marriageable damsel, shall not pay any nuptial fee to her father; for the (latter) will lose his dominion over her in consequence of his preventing (the legitimate result of the appearance of) her enemies.
triṃśadvarṣo vahet kanyāṃ hṛdyāṃ dvādaśavārṣikīm / tryaṣṭavarṣo 'ṣṭavarṣāṃ vā dharme sīdati satvaraḥ //	A man, aged thirty years, shall marry a maiden of twelve who pleases him, or a man of twenty-four a girl eight years of age; if (the performance of) his duties would (otherwise) be impeded, (he must marry) sooner.

prajanārthaṃ striyaḥ sṛṣṭāḥ saṃtānārthaṃ ca mānavaḥ / tasmāt sādhāraṇo dharmaḥ śrutau patnyā sahoditaḥ //	To be mothers were women created, and to be fathers men; religious rites, therefore, are ordained in the Veda to be performed (by the husband) together with the wife.
kanyāyāṃ dattaśulkāyāṃ mriyeta yadi śulkadaḥ / devarāya pradātavyā yadi kanyānumanyate //	If, after the nuptial fee has been paid for a maiden, the giver of the fee dies, she shall be given in marriage to his brother, in case she consents.
ādadīta na śūdro 'pi śulkaṃ duhitaraṃ dadan / śulkaṃ hi gṛhṇan kurute channaṃ duhitṛvikrayam //	Even a Sudra ought not to take a nuptial fee, when he gives away his daughter; for he who takes a fee sell his daughter, covering (the transaction by another name).
etat tu na pare cakrur nāpare jātu sādhavaḥ / yad anyasya pratijñāya punar anyasya dīyate //	Neither ancients nor moderns who were good men have done such (a deed) that, after promising (a daughter) to one man, they have her to another;
nānuśuśruma jātv etat pūrveṣv api hi janmasu / śulkasaṃjñena mūlyena channaṃ duhitṛvikrayam //	Nor, indeed, have we heard, even in former creations, of such (a thing as) the covert sale of a daughter for a fixed price, called a nuptial fee.

(Or) the eldest alone may take the whole paternal estate, the others shall live under him just as (they lived) under their father. Immediately on the birth of his first-born a man is (called) the father of a son and is freed from the debt to the manes; that (son), therefore, is worthy (to receive) the whole estate.
yasminn ṛṇaṃ saṃnayati yena cānantyam aśnute / sa eva dharmajaḥ putraḥ kāmajān itarān viduḥ //	That son alone on whom he throws his debt and through whom he obtains immortality, is begotten for (the fulfilment of) the law; all the rest they consider the offspring of desire.
piteva pālayet pūtrān jyeṣṭho bhrātṝṇ yavīyasaḥ / putravac cāpi varteran jyeṣṭhe bhrātari dharmataḥ //	As a father (supports) his sons, so let the eldest support his younger brothers, and let them also in accordance with the law behave towards their eldest brother as sons (behave towards their father).
jyeṣṭhaḥ kulaṃ vardhayati vināśayati vā punaḥ / jyeṣṭhaḥ pūjyatamo loke jyeṣṭhaḥ sadbhir agarhitaḥ //	The eldest (son) makes the family prosperous or, on the contrary, brings it to ruin; the eldest (is considered) among men most worthy of honour, the eldest is not treated with disrespect by the virtuous.
yo jyeṣṭho jyeṣṭhavṛttiḥ syān māteva sa piteva saḥ / ajyeṣṭhavṛttir yas tu syāt sa saṃpūjyas tu bandhuvat //	If the eldest brother behaves as an eldest brother (ought to do), he (must be treated) like a mother and like a father; but if he behaves in a manner unworthy of an eldest brother, he should yet be honoured like a kinsman.
evaṃ saha vaseyur vā pṛthag vā dharmakāmyayā / pṛthag vivardhate dharmas tasmād dharmyā pṛthakkriyā //	Either let them thus live together, or apart, if (each) desires (to gain) spiritual merit; for (by their living) separate (their) merit increases, hence separation is meritorious.
jyeṣṭhasya viṃśa uddhāraḥ sarvadravyāc ca yad varam / tato 'rdhaṃ madhyamasya syāt turīyaṃ tu yavīyasaḥ //	The additional share (deducted) for the eldest shall be one-twentieth (of the estate) and the best of all chattels, for the middlemost half of that, but for the youngest one-fourth.

uddhāro na daśasv asti saṃpannānāṃ svakarmasu / yat kiṃ cid eva deyaṃ tu jyāyase mānavardhanam //	But among (brothers) equally skilled in their occupations, there is no additional share, (consisting of the best animal) among ten; some trifle only shall be given to the eldest as a token of respect.
evaṃ samuddhṛtoddhāre samān aṃśān prakalpayet / uddhāre 'nuddhṛte tv eṣām iyaṃ syād aṃśakalpanā //	If additional shares are thus deducted, one must allot equal shares (out of the residue to each); but if no deduction is made, the allotment of the shares among them shall be (made) in the following manner.
ekādhikaṃ harej jyeṣṭhaḥ putro 'dhyardhaṃ tato 'nujaḥ / aṃśam aṃśaṃ yavīyāṃsa iti dharmo vyavasthitaḥ //	Let the eldest son take one share in excess, the (brother) born next after him one (share) and a half, the younger ones one share each; thus the law is settled.
svebhyo 'ṃśebhyas tu kanyābhyaḥ pradadyur bhrātaraḥ pṛthak / svāt svād aṃśāc caturbhāgaṃ patitāḥ syur aditsavaḥ //	But to the maiden (sisters) the brothers shall severally give (portions) out of their shares, each out of his share one-fourth part; those who refuse to give (it), will become outcasts.
ajāvikaṃ saikaśaphaṃ na jātu viṣamaṃ bhajet / ajāvikaṃ tu viṣamaṃ jyeṣṭhasyaiva vidhīyate //	Let him never divide (the value of) a single goat or sheep, or a (single beast) with uncloven hoofs; it is prescribed (that) a single goat or sheep (remaining after an equal division, belongs) to the eldest alone.
yavīyāñ jyeṣṭhabhāryāyāṃ putram utpādayed yadi / samas tatra vibhāgaḥ syād iti dharmo vyavasthitaḥ //	If a younger brother begets a son on the wife of the elder, the division must then be made equally; this the law is settled.
upasarjanaṃ pradhānasya dharmato nopapadyate / pitā pradhānaṃ prajane tasmād dharmeṇa taṃ bhajet //	The representative (the son begotten on the wife) is not invested with the right of the principal (the eldest brother to an additional share); the principal (became) a father on the procreation (of a son by his younger brother); hence one should give a share to the (son begotten on the wife of the elder brother) according to the rule (stated above).
putraḥ kaniṣṭho jyeṣṭhāyāṃ kaniṣṭhāyāṃ ca pūrvajaḥ / kathaṃ tatra vibhāgaḥ syād iti cet saṃśayo bhavet //	If there be a doubt, how the division shall be made, in case the younger son is born of the elder wife and the elder son of the younger wife,
ekaṃ vṛṣabham uddhāraṃ saṃhareta sa pūrvajaḥ / tato 'pare jyeṣṭhavṛṣās tadūnānāṃ svamātṛtaḥ // jyeṣṭhas tu jāto jyeṣṭhāyāṃ hared vṛṣabhaṣoḍaśāḥ / tataḥ svamātṛtaḥ śeṣā bhajerann iti dhāraṇā //	(Then the son) born of the first wife shall take as his additional share one (most excellent) bull; the next best bulls (shall belong) to those (who are) inferior on account of their mothers. But the eldest (son, being) born of the eldest wife, shall receive fifteen cows and a bull, the other sons may then take shares according to (the seniority of) their mothers; that is a settled rule.
sadṛśastrīṣu jātānāṃ putrāṇām aviśeṣataḥ / na mātṛto jyaiṣṭhyam asti janmato jyaiṣṭhyam ucyate //	Between sons born of wives equal (in caste) (and) without (any other) distinction no seniority in right of the mother exists; seniority is declared (to be) according to birth.
janmajyeṣṭhena cāhvānaṃ subrahmaṇyāsv api smṛtam / yamayoś caiva garbheṣu janmato jyeṣṭhatā smṛtā //	And with respect to the Subrahmanya (texts) also it is recorded that the invocation (of Indra shall be made) by the first-born, of twins likewise, (conceived at one time) in the wombs (of their mothers) the seniority is declared (to depend) on (actual) birth.
aputro 'nena vidhinā sutāṃ kurvīta putrikām / yad apatyaṃ bhaved asyāṃ tan mama syāt svadhākaram //	He who has no son may make his daughter in the following manner an appointed daughter (putrika, saying to her husband), 'The (male) child, born of her, shall perform my funeral rites.'
anena tu vidhānena purā cakre 'tha putrikāḥ / vivṛddhyarthaṃ svavaṃśasya svayaṃ dakṣaḥ prajāpatiḥ //	According to this rule Daksha, himself, lord of created beings, formerly made (all his female offspring) appointed daughters in order to multiply his race.

yathaivātmā tathā putraḥ putreṇa duhitā samā / tasyām ātmani tiṣṭhantyāṃ katham anyo dhanaṃ haret //	A son is even (as) oneself, (such) a daughter is equal to a son; how can another (heir) take the estate, while such (an appointed daughter who is even) oneself, lives?
mātus tu yautakaṃ yat syāt kumārībhāga eva saḥ / dauhitra eva ca hared aputrasyākhilaṃ dhanam //	But whatever may be the separate property of the mother, that is the share of the unmarried daughter alone; and the son of an (appointed) daughter shall take the whole estate of (his maternal grandfather) who leaves no son.
dauhitro hy akhilaṃ riktham aputrasya pitur haret / sa eva dadyād dvau piṇḍau pitre mātāmahāya ca //	The son of an (appointed) daughter, indeed, shall (also) take the estate of his (own) father, who leaves no (other) son; he shall (then) present two funeral cakes to his own father and to his maternal grandfather.
pautradauhitrayor loke na viśeṣo 'sti dharmataḥ / tayor hi mātāpitarau saṃbhūtau tasya dehataḥ //	Between a son's son and the son of an (appointed) daughter there is no difference, neither with respect to worldly matters nor to sacred duties; for their father and mother both sprang from the body of the same (man).
putrikāyāṃ kṛtāyāṃ tu yadi putro 'nujāyate / samas tatra vibhāgaḥ syāj jyeṣṭhatā nāsti hi striyāḥ //	But if, after a daughter has been appointed, a son be born (to her father), the division (of the inheritance) must in that (case) be equal; for there is no right of primogeniture for a woman.
aputrāyāṃ mṛtāyāṃ tu putrikāyāṃ kathaṃ cana / dhanaṃ tat putrikābhartā haretaivāvicārayan // akṛtā vā kṛtā vāpi yaṃ vindet sadṛśāt sutam / pautrī mātāmahas tena dadyāt piṇḍaṃ hared dhanam //	But if an appointed daughter by accident dies without (leaving) a son, the husband of the appointed daughter may, without hesitation, take that estate. Through that son whom (a daughter), either not appointed or appointed, may bear to (a husband) of equal (caste), his maternal grandfather (has) a son's son; he shall present the funeral cake and take the estate.
putreṇa lokāñ jayati pautreṇānantyam aśnute / atha putrasya pautreṇa bradhnasyāpnoti viṣṭapam //	Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a son's son he obtains immortality, but through his son's grandson he gains the world of the sun.
puṃnāmno narakād yasmāt trāyate pitaraṃ sutaḥ / tasmāt putra iti proktaḥ svayam eva svayaṃbhuvā //	Because a son delivers (trayate) his father from the hell called Put, he was therefore called put-tra (a deliverer from Put) by the Self-existent (Svayambhu) himself.
pautradauhitrayor loke viśeṣo nopapadyate / dauhitro 'pi hy amutrainaṃ saṃtārayati pautravat //	Between a son's son and the son of a daughter there exists in this world no difference; for even the son of a daughter saves him (who has no sons) in the next world, like the son's son.

gotrarikthe janayitur na hared dattrimaḥ kva cit / gotrarikthānugaḥ piṇḍo vyapaiti dadataḥ svadhā //	An adopted son shall never take the family (name) and the estate of his natural father; the funeral cake follows the family (name) and the estate, the funeral offerings of him who gives (his son in adoption) cease (as far as that son is concerned).
aniyuktāsutaś caiva putriṇyāptaś ca devarāt / ubhau tau nārhato bhāgaṃ jārajātakakāmajau //	The son of a wife, not appointed (to have issue by another), and he whom (an appointed female, already) the mother of a son, bears to her brother-in-law, are both unworthy of a share, (one being) the son of an adulterer and (the other) produced through (mere) lust.
niyuktāyām api pumān nāryāṃ jāto 'vidhānataḥ / naivārhaḥ paitṛkaṃ rikthaṃ patitotpādito hi saḥ //	Even the male (child) of a female (duly) appointed, not begotten according to the rule (given above), is unworthy of the paternal estate; for he was procreated by an outcast.

etad vidhānaṃ vijñeyaṃ vibhāgasyaikayoniṣu / bahvīṣu caikajātānāṃ nānāstrīṣu nibodhata //	The rules (given above) must be understood (to apply) to a distribution among sons of women of the same (caste); hear (now the law) concerning those begotten by one man on many wives of different (castes).
brāhmaṇasyānupūrvyeṇa catasras tu yadi striyaḥ / tāsāṃ putreṣu jāteṣu vibhāge 'yaṃ vidhiḥ smṛtaḥ //	If there be four wives of a Brahmana in the direct order of the castes, the rule for the division (of the estate) among the sons born of them is as follows:

pratigṛhyāpratigrāhyaṃ bhuktvā cānnaṃ vigarhitam / japaṃs taratsamandīyaṃ pūyate mānavas tryahāt //	That man who, having accepted presents which ought not to be accepted, or having eaten forbidden food, mutters the Taratsamandiya (Rikas), becomes pure after three days.
somāraudraṃ tu bahvenāḥ māsam abhyasya śudhyati / sravantyām ācaran snānam aryamṇām iti ca tṛcam //	But he who has committed many sins, becomes pure, if he recites during a month the (four verses) addressed to Soma and Rudra, and the three verses (beginning) 'Aryaman, Varuna, and Mitra,' while he bathes in a river.
abdārdham indram ity etad enasvī saptakaṃ japet / apraśastaṃ tu kṛtvāpsu māsam āsīta bhaikṣabhuk //	A grievous offender shall mutter the seven verses (beginning with) 'Indra,' for half a year; but he who has committed any blamable act in water, shall subsist during a month on food obtained by begging.
mantraiḥ śākalahomīyair abdaṃ hutvā ghṛtaṃ dvijaḥ / sugurv apy apahanty eno japtvā vā nama ity ṛcam // mahāpātakasaṃyukto 'nugacched gāḥ samāhitaḥ / abhyasyābdaṃ pāvamānīr bhaikṣāhāro viśudhyati //	A twice-born man removes even very great guilt by offering clarified butter with the sacred texts belonging to the Sakala-homas, or by muttering the Rik, (beginning) 'Adoration.' He who is stained by mortal sin, becomes pure, if, with a concentrated mind, he attends cows for a year, reciting the Pavamani (hymns) and subsisting on alms.
araṇye vā trir abhyasya prayato vedasaṃhitām / mucyate pātakaiḥ sarvaiḥ parākaiḥ śodhitas tribhiḥ //	Or if, pure (in mind and in body), he thrice repeats the Samhita of the Veda in a forest, sanctified by three Paraka (penances), he is freed from all crimes causing loss of caste (pataka).

yathāśvamedhaḥ kraturāṭ sarvapāpāpanodanaḥ / tathāghamarṣaṇaṃ sūktaṃ sarvapāpāpanodanam //	As the horse-sacrifice, the king of sacrifices, removes all sin, even so the Aghamarshana hymn effaces all guilt.
hatvā lokān apīmāṃs trīn aśnann api yatas tataḥ / ṛgvedaṃ dhārayan vipro nainaḥ prāpnoti kiṃ cana //	A Brahmana who retains in his memory the Rig-veda is not stained by guilt, though he may have destroyed these three worlds, though he may eat the food of anybody.

yathā mahāhradaṃ prāpya kṣiptaṃ loṣṭaṃ vinaśyati / tathā duścaritaṃ sarvaṃ vede trivṛti majjati //	As a clod of earth, falling into a great lake, is quickly dissolved, even so every sinful act is engulfed in the threefold Veda.
ṛco yajūṃṣi cānyāni sāmāni vividhāni ca / eṣa jñeyas trivṛdvedo yo vedainaṃ sa vedavit //	The Rikas, the Yagus (-formulas) which differ (from the former), the manifold Saman (-songs), must be known (to form) the triple Veda; he who knows them, (is called) learned in the Veda.
ādyaṃ yat tryakṣaraṃ brahma trayī yasmin pratiṣṭhitā / sa guhyo 'nyas trivṛdvedo yas taṃ veda sa vedavit //	The initial triliteral Brahman on which the threefold (sacred science) is based, is another triple Veda which must be kept secret; he who knows that, (is called) learned in the Veda.
