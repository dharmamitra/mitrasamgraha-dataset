The Vedas, the Puranas and the Law-books are the sources of know- ledge since they are direct embodiments of the prescriptions of the means to human ends. The auxiliary Vedic works such as, Grammar, Astronomy, Phonetics, Ritualistic treatises, Prosody and Etymology, are also sources of knowledge since4 Nyāyamanjarī they throw light on the meanings of the Vedic words, etc.
teṣām aṅgasamākhyaiva tadanugāmitāṃ prakaṭayati //	(In other words, they help to understand the meaning of the Vedic texts.) The very designation 'subsidiary Vedic texts' shows that these works directly help the understanding of the Vedic works.

Confirmation of the Introduction of the Study of Nyaya (Logic). The extensive Nyaya Literature is the main pillar upon which all branches of learning rest since it establishes the validity of the Vedic rites confidence in which may be shaken if the validity of the Vedas is gainsaid by the unfair criticism of the bad logi- cians.
kiṃ vā svāmini parimlāne tadanuyāyinā mīmāṃsādividyāsthānaparijanena kṛtyam iti /	In that case, the people will hesitate to perform the Vedic rites which mean a lot of expenditure of hard-earned money and stupendous labour.

The compound word 'Vidyā-sthāna'The Logic of Gautama as a Source of Knowledge conveys the source of such knowledge. In some of them this character is directly grasped and in others it is indirectly grasped.

purāṇaṃ dharmaśāstraṃ ca vidyā hy etāś caturdaśa] iti //	"These fourteen branches of study are the six ancillary sciences, the four Vedas, Mīmāṁsā, the extensive literature of logic, the Purāņa and the Dharma-śāstra.

The validity of the Vedas cannot be established if we make use of their logic to do so. Thus the logic of these schools does not deserve the title of logic.
%to what extent does their logic uphold the authority of the Veda? bauddhās tu yady api anumānamārgāvagāhananaipuṇoddhurāṃ kandharām udvahanti tathāpi vedāviruddhatvāt tattarkasya kathaṃ vedādividyāsthānamadhye pāṭhaḥ /	The Buddhists are very proud of the superiority of their power of argumentation. But as the drift of their logic is to cotradict the truth of the Vedas so their logic cannot be included in the branches of learning headed by the Vedas etc.
anumānakauśalam api kīdṛśaṃ śākyānām iti pade pade darśayiṣyāmaḥ //	We shall also demonstrate the hollowness of the arguments, advanced by the Buddhists at every step.
cārvākās tu varākāḥ pratikṣeptavyā eva kaḥ kṣudratarkasya tadīyasyeha gaṇanāvasaraḥ /	The wretched Cärvākas, on the other hand, should only be neglected since their unworthy logic has no scope for being enumerated as one of the branches of learning.

"Tarka' or "Nyayavistara' which figures in the six systems of logic widely known among people denotes the science of Logic of the Vaiseşikas as well. Moreover, the logic of Gautama which bears the designation *änvīkşiki' is counted as one of the four branches of learning.6 Anvikṣiki, the three Vedas, Vārttā (Commerce) and the eternal Political Science constitute the four branches of study.
pratyakṣāgamābhyām īkṣitasya anvīkṣaṇaṃ anvīkṣā anumānam ity arthaḥ tadvyutpādakaṃ śāstram anvīkṣikī //	The term 'anvīkṣşā' signifies inference since it corroborates the evi- dence of perception and verbal testimony. The science which aims at the elaboration of such inference is called 'Ănvīkşikî'.

There is no real contradiction between these two divisions of learning. Commerce and Political Science are only of secular interest and consequently cannot find a place in such branches of learning as have spiritual significance as well. The three Vedas and Ānvīkṣikī being also included in the former list of study, the branches of learning are truly fourteen.

Now, if the function of logic is only to establish the validity of the Vedas then there is no need of it since Mīmāṁsā can easily replace it. In the Mimāṁsā literature the vedic rituals as well as the validity of the Vedas have been discussed.
tatra mukhyas tv arthavicāra eva /	This contention is true on its surface.

sā ca vākyārthavidyā na pramāṇavidyeti / na ca mīmāṃsakāḥ samyak vedaprāmāṇyarakṣaṇakṣamāṃ saraṇim avalokayituṃ kuśalāḥ /	Mimāṁsā is the science of interpretation but is not a work on Logic and Epis- temology. The Mīmāṁsakas are not adept in defending the validity of the Vedas.

The unaided verbal testimony which depends upon perception for its existence is certainly unreliable. A sentence can only independently convey its meaning on the strength of the established convention but for the determination of the truth of its meaning the knowledge about its author is indispensable.
tasmād āptoktatvād eva śabdaḥ pramāṇībhavati nānyathety etac cāsminn eva śāstre vyutpādayiṣyate //	The meaning of a sentence is true if the author of it is trust- worthy but not otherwise. This point will be elaboratelyThe Logic of Gautama-its usefulness discussed later on.

(The purport of the objection is that if the Vedas do not carry their own validity then all attempts will fall through to prove their extrinsic vali- dity). But it is indeed a feeble objection. Who has interpreted the Vedas before Jaimini? Who has given the analysis of words before Păņini? Who has made a study of metres before Pingala? From the dawn of creation these sciences are in vogue on earth like the Vedas.

Now another question crops up in our mind if the great minds admit that the validity of the Vedas is intrinsic then does not our effort go in vain to prove a settled matter? We say 'No' since we make an attempt emoving a possible doubt or illusion of a layman.
yasya hi vedaprāmāṇye saṃśayānā viparyastā vā matiḥ taṃ prati śāstrārambhaḥ /	The science of logic will prove to be a fruitful study to them who are under the spell of doubt or illusion.

The first type re- presents the ignorant. The second one stands for the doubtful.

He enlightens the ignorant by his logical treatise (the vehicle of instruction). He hereby removes the doubt of an oscillating mind and corrects the mistake of an illusory mind.

How does one know that the sage in ques- tion sees objects in their true perspectives? An answer to the question runs thus:-The acquisition of the true view of the world may be due either to the practice of penance or to the worship of deity or to the close study of some other books. Let it be so, still the answer is not satisfactory. If the third alter- native answer is accepted then we shall also be able to gather the correct view of the world from that work and in that case the work of Akṣapāda is useless.
vicitracetasaś ca bhavanti puruṣā ity uktam /	Moreover, the mentality of the readers is diverse. This is what has been stated.
yeṣām ita evājñānasaṃśayaviparyayā vinivartante tān praty etat praṇayanaṃ saphalam itīdaṃ praṇītavān ācāryaḥ /	The study of Akşapāda's logic is at least fruitful to those who get their ignorance dispelled, doubts solved and mistakes corrected by it. That is why the great teacher has composed it.

Why does the first sentence thus commence? What is the drift of this question? If a teacher delivers a series of lectures which result in a book then he cannot but commence his work without beginning with a sentence since the whole of his lecture cannot be delivered all at once. Without speaking out the first sentence the second one cannot be given out. Now if you find fault with the first sentence only because it is the first one then the book which consists of a large number of such sentences cannot be composed.
āha na khalv evaṃ na jāne kintu yad eva śāstre vyutpādyatvena sthitaṃ tad eva vyutpādyatām /	Now the objector replies:—'Do not think that I do not know all these'.

abhidheyaphalajñānavirahāstamitodyamāḥ / śrotum alpam api grantham ādriyeran na sūrayaḥ // ko hi nāma vidvān aviditaviṣaye niṣprayojane ca karmaṇi pravarteta /	The learned scholars decline to lend their ears even to the contents of a small treatise if the broad outline of the subject- matter and its end were not known to them at the initial stage.Subject-Matter No learned man undertakes such an action the details and the utility of which are not known to him.
āha ca bhaṭṭaḥ [sarvasyaiva hi śāstrasya karmaṇo vā 'pi kasyacit /	Bhaṭṭa says to this effect, "Neither a person undertakes an action nor he cares to read a book unless he realises the usefulness of either of them." Very well.

Or, does it flash in our mind whenever we follow the logic of it? How do we make the correct estimates of its utility unless we know the truth of the statement? If it is held that even a man, who entertains a doubt as to the utility of a book pro- ceeds to read it then a man may also proceed to perform a Vedic rite without being sure of its efficacy.
saṃśayād vā pravṛttau vedārthe 'pi tathaiva syād iti śāstram anārabdhavyaṃ syāt //	If it is held that when a man understands the utility of a book following its logic he reads the whole of it but not otherwise.

The purport of the solution is the statement of the psychologi- cal condition of a reader which is favourable for a reader to read a new book. The mere knowledge of the utility of the book is necessary only for his movement. The reader may doubt the validity of the statement of utility and the truth of the subject- matter of the book.
vede hy asiddhaprāmāṇye mahākleśeṣu karmasu / nānarthaśaṅkayā yuktaṃ anuṣṭānapravartanam //	If a man is not convinced of the validity of the Vedas then it is not proper for him to undertake to perform very difficult Vedic rites in a hesitant mood.
bahuvittavyayāyāsaviyogasugame 'dhvani / pravṛttir ucitodāraphale laghupariśrame //	An undertaking which demands little, is easy to perform and does not entail tremendous labour and heavy expense upon a performer but has a very bright prospect is taken up.
śṛṇvanta eva jānanti santaḥ katipayair dinaiḥ / kim etat saphalaṃ śāstram uta mandaprayojanam //	The intelligent persons, during the course of their lecture, know for themselves within a few daysNyayamanjari whether the study of the subject is conducive to a big result or a small one.
sūkṣmekṣikā tu yady atra kriyate prathamodyame / asau sakalakartavyavipralopāya kalpate //	10 1 If a person goes on to scrutinize the result of his undertaking from the very start of an action then he will never make progress but will surely court failure life.
ārto hi bhiṣajaṃ pṛṣṭvā taduktam anitiṣṭhate / tasmin savicikitsas tu vyādher ādhikyam āpnuyāt //	A diseased person generally sends for a physician, gets him- self examined by him and follows his prescription. But if he doubts the efficacy of his prescription and hesitates to follow it then his disease will simply wax strong.
tenādivākyād vijñāya sābhidheyaṃ prayojanam / tatsambhāvanayā kāryaḥ tacchāstraśravaṇādaraḥ //	Hence a man, knowing the utility and the broad outline of the subject-matter from the first sentence, should listen to the book in a reverential mood with the expectation that its study may prove useful.
yair apy ādivākyam itthaṃ vyākhyāyate kila [ananvitapadārthakaṃ vākyam anupādeyaṃ daśadāḍim ādivākyavat / anvitapadārthakam api niṣprayojanam anupādeyam eva sadasadvāyasadaśanavimarśavākyam iva / tad iha upādeyatāvyāpakaprayojanādyanupalambhād anādaraṇīyam iti vyāpakānupalabdhyā pratyavatiṣṭhamānaḥ paraḥ prayojanādyabhidhāyinā ādivākyasyārtha ity uktaṃ bhavati /	Some learned scholars have discussed the usefulness of the first sentence of a book in a different manner. A sentence in which the constituent words are not mutually connected is to be rejected as it conveys no sense resembling in this respect an expression like 'ten pomegranates' etc., of which words are not syntactically connected. Even a sentence which conveys sense, having its constituent words mutually connected, should be rejected as worthless if it answers no purpose like the following interrogatory one, "Are the teeth of a crow good or bad?" A sentence which points to a useful object is accepted.
tatpratipādanenaiva vyāpakānupalabdhiparihārād āśaṅkā nivāritā bhavatīti //	If the first sentence had not described the goal of the book then the objector would have rejected the book on that very ground.

The very statement of the aim and object of a book does away with all our misgivings with regard to it since the condition which prepares ground for rejection has been excluded. Others hold that the first sentence calls up either a doubt as to the realization of the end expressed in it or a feeling of probability of its realization.
saṃśayas tu vastuvṛttopanata eva puruṣavacasāṃ dvaividhyadarśanāt /	But any one of these two feelings is roused. up only by the expression of the end in question by the first sentence.
śaucasam ācārasādhutādinā tu tasmin sambhāvanāpratyayo 'pi lokasya bhavatīti /	When he notices that the author is pure, good and honest he thinks that the above statement may be true.
tasmāt prayojanapratipādanārtham evādivākyam iti sūktam // yac ca śrotṛpravṛttyaṅgaṃ tadvaktuṃ yuktam āditaḥ /	There, it has been stated well that the only object of the first sentence is to express the usefulness of the book. At the outset it is proper to speak out what attracts a listener to lend his ears to it.
na ca prayojanajñānād anyad asti pravartakam //	There is no other motive than to convey the end in question.
abhidheyakathanam api tatsādhyaprayojanopapādanāya śrotṛbuddhisamādhānāya ca kartavyam eva //	ir The contents of a book should be narrated in order to prove its utility which follows from their knowledge to invite the attention of a listener.
arthākṣiptas tu sambandhaḥ phalaśāstrābhidheyagaḥ /	The relation of the signifier and the signified holds between the science of logic and its contents.
abhidheyasya śāstrasya ca vācyavācakabhāvalakṣaṇaḥ sambandhaḥ śāstrārthasya niḥśreyasya ca sādhyasādhanabhāvalakṣaṇaḥ sambandhaḥ tadāśrayanirdeśād eva siddhaḥ //	The specified relations are grasped by us to the exclusion of other possible relations because the relations themselves as stated clearly indi- cate their appropriateness. The narration of the main topics of the science of logic.
abhidheyās tu pramānādayo nigrahasthānaparyantāḥ ṣoḍaśa padārthāḥ prathamasūtre nirdiṣṭāḥ teṣāṃ svarūpam upariṣṭhād vakṣyate //	The main topics of the science of logic are sixteen in number. They begin with Pramāṇa (the source of valid knowledge) and end in Nigraha-sthāna (the source of defeat in a debate). An adequate treatment of them will take place later on. Let us now give a rough sketch of them.
arthaparicchittisādhanāni pratyakṣādīni pramāṇāni /	The source of the true knowledge of an object such as perception etc., is called Pra- māņa.
tatparicchedyam ātmādi prameyam /	The object of such true knowledge is called Prameya such as Atman etc.
nānārthāvamarśaḥ saṃśayaḥ /	common and exclusively particular.
hitāhitaprāptiparihārau tatsādhanaṃ ca prayojanam /	If it is known as such by means of proofs and accepted as such then it is called Siddhanta.
hetoḥ pratibandhāvadhāraṇaṃ dṛṣṭāntaḥ / pramāṇato 'bhyupagamyamānaḥ sāmānyaviśeṣavān arthaḥ siddhāntaḥ /	When two rival hypotheses are offered to explain a fact one is preferred to the other for its having stronger reasons. The more reasonable one seems to us to be the probable explanation.
sandigdhe 'rthe 'nyatarapakṣānukūlakāraṇadarśanāt tasmin sambhāvanāpratyayas tarkaḥ / sādhanopalambhajanmā tattvāvbodho nirṇayaḥ /	The knowledge of such probability is called Tarka. Nirnaya is the arrival at a truth by means of the establishment of the hypothesis of one's own school and the refutation of that of his rival school.
vītarāgakathā vastunirṇayaphalā vādaḥ /	A dispassionate discussion which results in the finding out of the truth is Vāda.
vijigīṣukathā tu puruṣaśaktiparīkṣaṇaphalā jalpaḥ /	Jalpa is such a debate in which the contesting parties care only to win anyhow and in which there is only a free play of intellectual powers.
tadviśeṣo vitaṇḍā /	A species of Jalpa is Vitandā.
ahetavo hetuvad ābhāsamānāḥ hetvābhāsāḥ /	What is not a true mark but appears to be so is called a Hetvābhāsa.
arthavikalpair vacanavighātaḥ chalam / hetupratibimbanaprāyaṃ pratyavasthānaṃ jātiḥ /	The adverse criticism of a sentence by means of the distortion of its meaning is called Chala, Jāti means an opposition by a counter-argument simply based upon resemblance or difference, but not upon sound grounds.
satyavastvapratibhāsaḥ viparītapratibhāsaś ca nigrahasthānam //	Nigraha- sthāna is such as never gives a true picture of a fact but always a false one.
tatra vakṣyamāṇalakṣaṇasūtranirdeśānusāreṇa kānicit ekavacanāntāni kānicid vahuvacanāntāni padāni vigṛhītavyāni / pramāṇāvayavahetvābhāsānāṃ bahuvacanena vigraho darśayitavyaḥ śeṣāṇām ekavacanena lakṣaṇasūtraṣu tathā nirdeśāt /	These items have been subsequently defined by appropriate sūtras. In the light of those sútras we know that some of the component words of the compound word have only singular number. In the expounding sentence which explains the above compound word the component words which have singular number should have such inflexion as indicates the singular number. The words such as Pramāṇa, Avayava and Hetvābhāsa should have inflexion indicative of the plural number in the expounding sentence.
evañ coddeśalakṣaṇayor ekaviṣayatā nitarāṃ darśitā bhavati /	Thus, the thorough agreement between the general statement and the specified ones has been perfectly maintained.
itaretarayoge dvandvas samāsaḥ / pramāṇādīnāṃ tattvam iti sambandhamātre ṣaṣṭhī /	The compound in this particular instance is dvandva which conveys the sense of mutual conjunction.
nanv evaṃ vyākhyāyamāne tattvapadasya pramāṇādipadasāpekṣatvenāsamarthatvāt asamāsaḥ prāpnoti /	13 The above explanation is not satisfactory. The word 'tattva' is a dependent one since it refers to Pramăņa etc. for the complete expression of its meaning.
na cedaṃ pradhānam sāpekṣam yena bhavati vai pradhānasya sāpekṣasyāpi samāsa iti rājapuruṣaḥ śobhana itivat samasyate uttarapadārthapradhānatvāt ṣaṣṭhītatpuruṣasya /	Such a dependent word should not be compounded with another word. The principal word in a compound is allowed to be compounded though it is related to an uncompounded word. In the sentence 'Rājapurusaḥ sobhanah' the word 'śobhanah' relates to puruṣaḥ.
jñānam evātra pradhānaṃ tattvam upasarjanam ataś ca ṛddhasya rājñaḥ puruṣa itivad asamāsa eva yuktaḥ //	in the sentence 'rddhasya rājñaḥ puruṣaḥ' the word 'rajñaḥ' is not allowed to enter into a compound word as its component. The drift of the argument is that the compound- ing of the word 'tattva' is inadmissible.
nanu jñānam api pramāṇādisāpekṣaṃ bhavaty eva tadviṣayaṃ hi tad iti na tattvapadenāsya nirākāṅkṣīkṛtatvāt tattvasya jñānam iti /	They hold that the term 'jñāna' is also related to the words *Pramāņa and others' since they are also objects of knowledge. If the word 'tattva' is related to the words 'pramāṇa etc.,' the above objection arises.
tasmāt tattvasyopasarjanasya sataḥ sāpekṣatvād asamāsa eva //	But if the word 'jñana' is related to the words "pramana etc.' then no such difficulty arises.
ity evam abhiśaṅkamānā kecana tattvaṃ ca tat jñānaṃ ca iti karmadhārayaṃ vyācacakṣire tat punar ayuktam jñānasya svatas tattvātattvavibhāgābhāvāt /	solution of the above problem is simply this, the word 'tattva' which has no other 'correlative term' is compounded with “jñāna”, a principal word in spite of its reference to other terms. The proposed compound is 'karmadharaya'.
viṣayakṛto hi jñānānāṃ tathābhāvo 'tathābhāvo vā / tadetat tattvaviṣayajñānaṃ bhavati na svatas tattvasvabhāvam //	No knowledge is in itself true or untruc. If a piece of knowledge correctly reveals an object, it is truc. If not, it is untrue. Truth or untruth is an extrinsic property of knowledge but not intrinsic.
kiṃ punar idaṃ tattvaṃ nāma sato 'sato vā vastunaḥ pramāṇapariniścitasvarūpaṃ śabdapravṛttinimittaṃ tad ity ucyate /	The word 'tat' has a definite meaning. It conveys the sense that the meaning in question is either a positive or negative real well-determined by a source of true knowledge.
tasya bhāvas tattvam iti /	The essence of such a real is 'tattva'.
tac ca jñānena niścīyate / tat paricchindyat jñānaṃ tattvajñānam ity ucyate /	TheNyāyamanjari piece of true knowledge which reveals such an essence is called tattva-jñāna. The essence of true knowledge i.e.
jñānasyāpi tadrūpaṃ jñānāntaraparicchedyam eva bhavati /	are determined by a piece of knowledge other than the objects of it.
nirṇītatattvāś ca pramāṇādaya iti vyatirekanirdeśa eva yuktaḥ / na cāsamāsaprasaṅgamātrāt anyathā varṇanam ucitam /	The use of tattva as an object of knowledge is very significant since it throws light on the essential teaching of Nyaya-Logic, commentators should not be perplexed by the linguistic objections.
īdṛśānāṃ samāsānāṃ sāmarthyānapāyena bahuśo dṛṣṭatvāt devadattasya gurukulam iti /	The admissibility of such condemned terms in a compound word is noticed in many instances. A well- accepted example is 'Devadattasya gurukulam'.
upasarjanaṃ nopasarjanam iti na kāraṇam etat samāse / vigrahavākyasamānārthatayā samāso bhavati sā ceha vidyata eva /	If the sense is clearly expressed by a compound word of which any constituent term, principal or subordinate, has relation to other uncompoun- ded words, there is no bar to their forming a compound word.
vaiyyākaraṇā api īdṛśi padāni samasyanty eva /	The admissibility of such condemned terms in a compound word is noticed in many instances.
[atha śabdānuśāsanaṃ keṣāṃ śabdānām laukikānāṃ vaidikānāṃ ca] iti /	The Sanskrit sentence is like the laukikānām vaidikānāṁ ca śabdānuśāsanam'.
tasmād yathābhāṣyam eva ṣaṣṭhītrayavyākhyānam anavadyam // nanu ṣoḍaśapadārthatattvajñānasya kathaṃ niḥśreyasādhigamahetutvam iti vaktavyam /	Now it should be proved how the true knowledge of the sixteen topics of Gautama's logic leads up to the attainment of the highest good (niḥśreyasa). The declared purpose of it is to prove the validity of the Vedas.
vedaprāmāṇyasiddhyarthaṃ cedaṃ śāstram iti tāvan mātram eva vyutpādyatāṃ kiṃ ṣodaśapadārthakanthāgranthanena ucyate ātmāpavargaparyantadvādaśavidhaprameyajñānaṃ tāvat anyajñānānaupayikam eva sākṣād apavargasādhanam iti vkṣyāmaḥ /	Why do you take up the tedious task of discussing the sixteen topics? Our answer to such a question is that the true knowledge of the twelve objects beginning with the soul and ending in apavarga (the absolute cessation of all sorrows) is the direct means to the realisation of the final state of freedom from all sufferings and that the true knowledge of other objects is not conducive to the goal of life.
tattvajñānān mithyājñānanirāse sati tanmūlaḥ saṃsāro nivartata iti prameyaṃ tāvad avaśyopādeyam // tasya tu prameyasyātmāder apavargasādhanatvādhigama āgamaikanibandhanaḥ //	When our erroneous knowledge is dispelled by the true knowledge of the soul etc., our cycle of worldly existence, based on errors, comes to a stop. That is why the objects of the true knowledge must be instructed. We learn only from the Vedas that the true knowledge of objects such as the soul etc.
tasya prāmānyanirṇītir anumānanivandhanā /	The unfailing mark in that inference is the utterance of a trustworthy person.
āptoktatvaṃ ca talliṅgam avinābhāvi vikṣyate // pratibandhagrahe tasya pratyakṣam upayujyate /	We shall discuss the details of the mark later on. Perception alone helps us to detect the relation of invariable concomitance holding between the probans and the probandum.
ko 'nyas santaraṇe hetur anavasthāmahodadheḥ //	No other forms of knowledge help us in this matter since all other forms of knowledge land in regressus ad infinitum which baffles all attempts.
āyurvedādivākyeṣu dṛṣṭvā pratyakṣataḥ phalam / vacaḥ pramāṇam āptoktam iti nirnīyate yataḥ //	If one has the direct experience of the good results of the medical science then he will understand without the least doubt that the utterances of an ăpta (a seer-a trust- (Jayanta means to say that the worthy person) are true.
upamānaṃ tu kvacit karmaṇi sopayogaṃ ity evaṃ catuṣprakāram api pramāṇaṃ prameyavad upadeṣṭavyam //	Upamâna (comparison) also gives us assistance in some sphere of activity (viz., the detection of the relation holding between a word and its meaning). Therefore, the four proofs should also find a place in logic like the real objects such as the soul etc.
saṃśayādayas tu padārthā yathāsambhavaṃ pramāṇeṣu prameyeṣu cāntarbhavanto 'pi nyāyapravṛttihetutvāt pṛthag upadiśyante / nyāyaś ca vedaprāmāṇyapratiṣṭhāpanapūrvakatvena puruṣārthopayogitvam upayātīti darśitam //	Though doubt and other contentsNyāyamanjari 16 of the sutra are included by their very nature either in the proofs. or in the objects of the true knowledge, yet they have been sepa- rately treated because they induce a person to the syllogistic rea- soning. Syllogism which establishes the validity of the Vedas. helps us to realise human ends.
tatra nānupalabdhe 'rthe na nirṇīte pravartate / kin tu saṃśayite nyāyaḥ tadaṅgaṃ tena saṃśayaḥ //	No body uses syllogistic arguments to prove an unknown or a well-established object but a doubtful one. Hence doubt is an accessory of syllogism.
prayojanam anuddiśya na ca nyāyaṃ prayuñjate /	No one uses syllogism if it serves no purpose.
dṛṣṭāntaḥ punar etasya sambandhagrahaṇāspadam // siddhānto 'pi dharmaprāpaṇenāśrayāsiddhatām apoddharat nyāyaṃ pravartayati //	A positive instance again helps us to detect the relation of invariable concomitance holding between the probans and the probandum. Thus, it is intimately connected with induction and thereby with syllogism.
nanu saṃśayapadena nyāyaviṣayaṃ sandigdhaṃ dharmaṇam abhidadhatā āśrayāsiddhir apoddhṛtaiva satyam kvacit tu viṣaye saṃśayam antareṇāpi nyāyapravṛttir darśayisyata iti saṃśayitaikaviṣayanyāyaniyamābhāvāt siddhānto 'pi vaktavyaḥ //	Siddhänta (the establishment of the subject) also is a neces- sary condition of the demonstration of a syllogistic argument since it fulfils one of the conditions of an inference. It correctly asserts that the object to be inferred definitely belongs to the subject of inference. Thereby it counteracts the fallacy that the object to be inferred does not belong to the subject of infe- rence.
parārtham anumānaṃ ca tad āhur nyāyavādinaḥ //	There is much sense in this objection.
nanu pratijñodāharaṇābhyāṃ tadabhidheyau siddhāntadṛṣṭāntau gamyete eva kiṃ pṛthag upādānena na yady evaṃ hetvākhyenāvayavena tadabhidheyasiddher anumānam api pṛthak na vaktavyaṃ syāt /	But we should bear in mind that we do not always use syllogistic arguments to prove doubtful cases but also prove established facts by means of syllogism. There is no such rule that the syllogistic argument should only be used to prove doubtful cases.
evaṃ bhavatu kiṃ niścchinnam maivam abhidheye nyāye nirūpaṇīye tadabhidheyinām avayavānām avasara iti tadarthaḥ pṛthak pratipādanārho bhavati / itarathā avayavamātropadeśa eva śāstraṃ samāpyeta //	Hence, Siddhanta should be distinctly treated. If we employ a syllogistic argument to convince others then all the premises should be used since they are helpful to them for their better understanding. A syllogistic argument, consisting of 5 premises, is called parârtha-anumāna (an inference meant for convincing others).
tarkaḥ saṃśayavijñānaviṣayīkṛtatulyakalpapakṣadvaye 'nyatarapakṣaśaithilyasamutpādanena taditarapakṣaviṣayaṃ pramāṇaṃ akleśasaṃpadyamānapratipakṣavyudāsam anugṛhṇāti mārgaśuddhim ādadhāna iti pṛthag upadiśyate /	"Why should Dṛṣṭānta (a positive instance) and Siddhanta (an object estab- lished) be separately treated?' The drift of this objection is that as they constitute the meanings of the first and the third propositions (Pratijña and Udaharana) so it is superfluous to reconsider them afresh. A tentative reply is that if you argueTattvajñāna as a Means of Mokşa like this then Inference, a distinct source of valid knowledge, should not be enlisted in the list of the sources of valid knowledge since the second proposition which is called Hetu signifies it (i.e.
sa cāśayaśuddhim upadarśayituṃ vāde prayokṣyate //	Inference).
anyatarādhikaraṇanirṇayam antareṇa na paryavasyati nyāya iti nyāyoparamakāraṇatvena tasya pravartako nirṇayaḥ /	The objector may say, that it matters little whether Inference finds a place in the list or not. The further rejoinder to this objection is this :-Every item has its proper place in the system of logic.
nanu tattvajñānapadena gatārthatvān na pṛthak vaktavyo nirṇayaḥ / nirṇayo hi tattvajñānam eva asty etat kin tu ṣoḍaśapadārthatattvajñānaṃ pramāṇāntarakaraṇam api bhavati /	All of the five constituent proposi- tions together signify syllogism. They should only be discussed when the turn of syllogism will come up. Siddhānta, Dṛṣṭānta etc., precede syllogism.
na tasya nyāyoparamahetutvam /	Hence, they should be separately treated.
eṣa tu sādhanadūṣaṇasaraṇikṣodajanmā nirṇayaḥ taduparamahetuḥ pṛthag upādānam antareṇa na labhyate //	If the order of this system is not obeyed then the system of logic has no other topic to discuss than the five constituent propositions of a syllogism.
kāraṇasya pramāṇatvān nirṇayopādānam antareṇa tadanumānam aphalam aparyavasitaṃ syāt //	Tarka is separately discussed because it has a special function. to pave the way for one of the two rival hypotheses.
ubhābhyāṃ tarhi tattvajñānānumānapadābhyāṃ ayam ākṣepsyate nirṇayaḥ anumānasya tattvajñānāntatvāt na nirṇayopādānād vinā tadantatvāsiddheḥ liṅgābhāsasamutthatattvajñānābhāsasambhavāt //	When two rival hypotheses are known to us to explain a fact our mind naturally hesitates to cling to one of them under the supposition that each of them is almost equally strong. Tarka steps in to remove the state of indecision. It strengthens the arguments in favour of one of these two rival hypotheses by removing all doubts.
nanu saṃśayapūrvakatvād anumānasya sāmarthyāt nirṇayāntataiva bhaviṣyati iti saṃśayānumānatattvajñānapadair gatārtho nirṇayaḥ maivam saṃśayapūrvakatve 'py anumānasya tadābhasopajanitanirṇayābhāsasambhavāt //	The function of Tarka does not cease until the truth of one of the two rival hypotheses is established. The final ascertainment of truth (nirņaya) employs a tarka in order to work out its result, viz., the termination of a syllogistic argu- ment. If an unending chain of syllogism goes on for ever with- out reaching a final conclusion then no body would have been eager to seek the services of such a fruitless chain of syllogism.
naiṣa niyamaḥ saṃśayapūrvakam anumānam iti /	Nimaya is the very goal. It stops the movement of a syllogistic process.
tasmād anumānasya viśiṣṭanirṇayāvasānatvalābhāya nirṇayapadam upādeyam ity alaṃ prasaṅgena //	Hence, tattva-jñāna, the mover of a syllo- gism, cannot be identified with this nirnaya. We cannot know the true character of this nirnaya unless it is separately treated.
vāde tu vicāryamāṇo nyāyaḥ saṃśayacchedanenādhyavasitāvabodhaṃ adhyavasitābhyanujñānaṃ ca vidadhat tattvapariśuddhim ādadhātīti vītarāgaiḥ śiṣyasabrahmacāribhis saha vādaḥ prayoktavyaḥ //	In fine, in order to establish that a definite conclusion which is drawn from a syllogism, has a distinct character of its own, nimaya deserves a distinct mention...... There is no such rule Enough of it.Tattvajñāna as a Means of Moksa Suppose two contesting parties put forward the two distinct trains of syllogism in order to prove their opposite views on a certain topic.

hetvābhāsāḥ samyaṅ nyāyapravivekopakāradvāreṇa tadupayoginaḥ /	On special occasions even to the persons desirous of final emancipation such an unfair debate becomes serviceable.
hetvābhāsasvarūpāvadhāraṇe hi sati tadvilakṣaṇatayā hetavas sukham avagamyante //	19 The study of defective marks renders some service to a syllogistic argument since it helps us to discriminate between the sound and the defective minor premises which constitute a syllogism.
nanv atra viparyayo dṛśyate hetvavagame sati taditarahetvābhāsavyavasthānāt saty evam tathā 'pi proktuṃ parihartuṃ ca dvayam api jñeyam /	Though there is much truth in it yet when a proposition containing a middle term is to be used two things are to be noticed, viz., the employment of the true mark and the avoidance of the false one.
hetavaḥ prayujyante hetvābhāsāś ca parihriyanta iti //	Truly speaking hetväbhāsas belong to a species of Nigrahasthāna.
yac ca nigrahasthānaparigaṇitā api hetvābhāsāḥ punar apadiśyante tat vāde codanīyā bhaviṣyantīty āśayena //	But they are mainly pointed out in a dispassionate debate to invalidate the counter syllogism. That is why they have been separately treated.
chalajātinigrahasthānāni jalpavitaṇḍopakaraṇāni /	In cases of debate like Jalpi or Vitaṇḍā type, Chala, Jāti and Nigrahasthana are freely employed.
tesām avadhṛtasvarūpāṇāṃ svavākye parivarjanaṃ kvacid avasare prayogaḥ parayuktānāṃ ca pratisamādhānaṃ ityādi śakyakriyam /	One should know them thoroughly at first so that he will be able to play better the game of defence by not allowing his opponent to hurl them at the propositions employed by him.Nyāyamanjari On special occasions one under painful necessity uses them though it is not possible to use them always. Again, if his opponent uses them, he will be able to remedy them.
atas tāny āpi jalpavitaṇḍāṅgatvāt jñātavyānīti pṛthag upadiśyante //	One should know them as they invariably accompany Jalpa and Vitanda and are their part and parcel. For this very reason, they have been separately treated.
duśśikṣitakutarkāṃśaleśavācālitānanāḥ /	The Buddhists who have received wrong training in the art of logic are very vociferous.
śakyāḥ kim anyathā jetuṃ vitaṇḍāṭopapaṇḍitāḥ //	he cannot meet them and be able to win victory in such debates over them.
gatānugatiko lokaḥ kumārgaṃ tatpratāritaḥ / mā gād iti chalādīni prāha kāruṇiko muniḥ //	The compassionate sage Gautama comes to their rescue and teaches them all specimens of bad logic so that the simple minded people may not be misled by these designing logicians.
tad evam upadeṣṭavyāḥ padārthāḥ saṃśayādayaḥ / tanmūlanyāyanirṇeyavedaprāmāṇyasiddhaye //	Similarly, the other topics of logic, viz., a doubt etc. should also be taught so that the knowledge of the validity of the Vedic lore may be deeply rooted in their mind.
tenāgamapramāṇatvadvārā 'khilaphalapradā / iyam ānvīkṣikī vidyā vidyāsthāneṣu gaṇyate //	The science of Logic of Gautama rightly deserves a place among the sources of knowledge since it restores the validity of the Vedic scriptures.
āha ca bhāṣyakāraḥ [pradīpaḥ sarvavidyānām upāyaḥ sarvakarmaṇām / āśrayas sarvadharmāṇāṃ vidyoddeśe parīkṣitā //] ity eṣa ṣoḍaśapadārthanibandhanena niḥśreyasasya muninā nirdeśi panthāḥ /	20 The celebrated commentator says to this effect: The Logic of Gautama which like a lamp illuminates all other sources of knowledge, i.e., branches of learning, shows means to all actions and acts as a support of all dharmas, has been rightly ennumerat- ed in the list of the sources of knowledge. The sage has shown the path which leads to the destination of the absolute cessation of all sorrows.
anyas tu sann api padārthagaṇo 'pavargamārgopayogavirahād iha nopadiṣṭaḥ //	There are other objects of knowledge in this world. They have no bearing upon the final goal of life mentioned above.

The introduction of22 Nyāyamanjari ceed the division of its species.
vibhāgasāmānyalakṣaṇayos tu nāsti paurvāparyaniyamaḥ /	There is no ruling with regard to an order of place.
pūrva vā sāmānyalakṣaṇaṃ tato vibhāgaḥ pūrvaṃ vā vibhāgaḥ tatas sāmānyalakṣaṇam ucyata iti /	There may be first general definition and then division or there may be first division and then general definition. Thus the topic on nomenclature is exhaustively dis- cussed.
asmābhis tu lakṣaṇasūtrāny eva vyākhyāsyante /	Then the sutras which relate to definition will be explained.

We shall not take an extra trouble of explaining and dicussing the sūtras which concentrate upon the examination of a topic. After the explanation of the first Sutra of Gotama's Logic the second one will not be explained, since it neither embodies.
apavargaparīkṣāśeṣabhūtatvāt tu tadavasara eva nirṇayiṣyate //	It will be discussed in its appropriate place alongwith apavarga (the absolute cessation of all sorrows) since the content of this sutra is secondary to the treatment of apavarga.
pramāṇasāmānyalakṣaṇavibhāgasūtraṃ tv avasaraprāptatvād idānīm eva vivriyate pratyakṣānumānopamānaśabdāḥ pramāṇāni //1.1.3 atredaṃ tāvad vicāryate kiṃ pramāṇaṃ nāma kim asya svarūpam kiṃ vā lakṣaṇam iti tataḥ sūtraṃ yojayiṣyate //	The definition of Pramāṇa The definition of Pramâna will be discussed in the sutra on the division of Pramāņa since it finds an appropriate place therein. Pramāṇa admits of four-fold division, viz. Perception, Inference, Comparison and Verbal Testimony. Now, the following matter is going to be discussed. What is a pramāņa? What is the nature? What is its definition? The matter of enquiry being discussed the bearing of the sutra upon Pramāṇa will be taken up.
tad ucyate avyabhicāriṇīm asandigdhām arthopalabdhiṃ vidadhatī bodhābodhasvabhāvā sāmagrī pramāṇam /	Pramâņa is the collocation of the two types of ob- jects viz., consciousness and unconscious ones which co-operate to produce such an apprehension of objects as is other than an illusion and a doubt.
bodhābodhasvabhāvā sāmagrī hi tasya svarūpam /	Pramāṇa consists of two opposite elements viz.
avyabhicārādiviśeṣārthopalabdhisādhanatvaṃ lakṣaṇam // nanu ca pramīyate yena tat pramānam iti karaṇasādhano 'yaṃ pramāṇaśabdaḥ /	The definition of Pramana is what produces such an apprehension as is other than an illusion and a doubt. The etymological meaning of a pramāṇa is what is an instrument of the true knowledge.
karaṇaṃ ca sādhakatamam /	An instrument (Karaṇa) is defined to be the causa sui of an act (sådhaka-tama).
tam abarthaś cātiśayaḥ /	It presupposes the other objects with which it pared.
sādhakāntarasaṃbhave hi tadapekṣayā 'tiśayayogat kiñcit sādhakatamam ucyate / sāmagryāś caikatvāt tadatiriktasādhakāntarānupalmbhāt kim apekṣam asyātiśayaṃ brūmaḥ // api ca kasmin viṣaye sāmagryāḥ pramāṇatvam pramīyamāṇo hi karmabhūto viṣayaḥ sāmagryantarbhūtatvāt sāmagry eveti karaṇatām eva yāyāt /	There must be other conditions of an act amongst which it is the most efficacious. That is why it is called sādhaka-tama. Now, if the collocation of all conditions is the instrument then how can a comparison among them take place since the collo- cation is one and there are no other conditions outside the collocation? If the collocation of all conditions is the instru- ment of the true knowledge of an object, then how can it make room for comparison? The object which is being truly known is also one of the conditions of such knowledge.
nirālambanāś cedānīṃ sarvapramitayo bhaveyuḥ ālambanakārakasya cakṣurādivat pramāṇāntaḥpātitvāt //	Thus, all acts of true knowledge become objectless from this stand-point since the object of knowledge is included in the collocation like the sense-organ, viz., eyes, etc.
kaś ca sāmagryā prameyaṃ pramimīte pramātā 'pi tasyām eva līnaḥ /	Who will be the subject of an act of knowledge? The subject who knows an object by means of an instrument in the shape of collocation is also one of the conditions of an act of knowledge.
evañ ca yad ucyate [pramātā pramāṇaṃ prameyaṃ pramitir iti catasṛṣu vidhāsu tattvaṃ parisamāpyate] iti tad vyāhanyate /	Thus, the subject ceases to be the subject and becomes an instrument. If this absurd conclusion is accepted by the contender then the fundamental position of Nyaya-Epistemology is at stake (jeo- pardised).
na ca loko 'pi sāmagryāḥ karaṇabhāvam anumanyate tasyāṃ karaṇavibhaktim aprayuñjānaḥ /	The people at large do not approve of this hypothe- sis, since in the conversion we find no indication of a colloca- tion as being used in the shape of an instrumental case.
na hy evaṃ vaktāro bhavanti laukikāḥ sāmagryā paśyāma iti kin tu dīpena paśyāmaḥ cakṣuṣā nirīkṣāmaha ity ācakṣate /	No body says that he sees an object by means of the collocation of all conditions but he asserts that by means of his eyes he visua- lizes an object.
tasmān na sāmagrī kāraṇam akāraṇatvāc ca na pramāṇam iti nedaṃ sādhu pramāṇasvarūpam //	Therefore, no collocation of all conditions is an instrument. Hence, the collocation of conditions is not pramāņa.
atrocyate yata eva sādhakatamaṃ karaṇaṃ karaṇasādhanaś ca pramāṇaśabdaḥ tata eva sāmagryāḥ pramāṇatvaṃ yuktam tadvyatirekeṇa kārakāntare kvacid api tam abarthasaṃsparśānupapatteḥ /	A reply to these objections is as follows :- An instrument is such as gives the most efficient service to produce an act. The word 'pramana' denotes the instrument of true knowledge. Hence it is reasonable to hold that the colloca- 3024 tion of all conditions of true knowledge is pramāṇa. No other case excepting the aggregate of all of them can be the most effi- cacious one to produce it. When all the conditions assemble, the effect takes place.
anekakārakasannidhāne kāryaṃ ghaṭamānaṃ anyataravyapagame ca vighaṭamānaṃ kasmai atiśayaṃ prayacchet na cātiśayaḥ kāryajanmani kasyacid avadhāryate sarveṣāṃ tatra vyāpriyamāṇatvāt //	None of them singly does get the credit for making a special contribution towards its effectuation. None of them alone wins the distinction of doing a special service since all of them combine to do the effect in question and share in common the credit for production.
sannipattyajanakatvam atiśaya iti cen na ārādupakārakāṇām api kārakatvānapāyāt /	This contention does not hold good since what is indirectly con- nected with an effect is also a condition.
jñāne ca janye kim asannipatyajanakam sarveṣām indriyamano 'rthādīnām itaretarasaṃsarge sati jñānaniṣpatteḥ //	Moreover, all the con- ditions of an act of knowledge are directly related to the act in question. Let us take the example of an act of perception. All the conditions, viz., the senseorgan, the inner organ, the object, etc., combine together to produce the act of perception.
atha sahasaiva kāryajananam atiśayaḥ so 'pi kasyāñ cid avasthāyāṃ karaṇasyeva karmaṇo 'pi śakyate vaktuṃ yathā aviralajaladharadhārāprabandhabaddhāndhakāranivahe bahulaniśīthe sahasaiva sphuratā vidyul latā ''lokena kāminījñānam ādadhānena saty api sīmantinīm antareṇa taddarśanaṃ na saṃpadyate āgatamātrāyām eva tasyāṃ bhavatīti tad api karmakārakam atiśayayogitvāt karaṇaṃ syāt //	Now, the objector may contend that a condition, the immediate pre- sence of which brings about the effect, possesses a distinction. In other words, such a condition should be the instrument. Such a solution is not tenable since sometimes the immediate presence of an object is responsible for its perception. In a dark night when the sky is enveloped by clouds heaped upon clouds and pitchy darkness prevails a lady is suddenly revealed by a flash of lightning. It is generally believed that in this case the flash of lightning has a distinctive mark which no other condition possesses.
tasmāt phalotpādāvinābhāvisvabhāvatvam avaśyatayā kāryajanakatvam atiśayaḥ /	Therefore, the flash of lightning to the exclusion of all other conditions is the instrument.
sa ca sāmagrantargatasya na kasyacid ekasya kārakasya kathayituṃ pāryate /	But here is a point worth noting that if all other conditions excepting the lady assemble then the perception of the lady will not take place.
sāmagryās tu so 'tiśayaḥ suvacaḥ /	The lady is the object of the act of perception.
sannihitā cet sāmagrī saṃpannam eva phalam iti saivātiśayavatī //	causation. When the collocation of all conditions takes place the effect invariably comes into existence in close succession.
nanu mukhyayoḥ pramātṛprameyayor api tadavinābhāvitvam atiśayo 'sty eva pramitisambandham antareṇa tayos tathātvābhāvat /	Now, the objector may indulge in a further contention that since the subject and the object of an act of true knowledge are invariably connected with true knowledge, they should also possess the distinctive mark recognized by all.
pramiṇotīti pramātā bhavati pramīyata iti ca prameyam satyam etat kin tu sākalyaprasādalabdhapramitisambandhanaḥ pramātṛprameyayor mukhyasvarūpalābhaḥ /	A true object is what is grasped by the act of true knowledge. In other words, the subject or the object of every piece of true knowledge are invari- ably related to it as its subject or object. The contention is true.
sākalyāpacaye pramityabhāvāt gauṇe pramātṛprameye saṃpadyete / evañ ca sākalyam antareṇa yadi pramitir avakalpeta bhaved vyabhicāraḥ na tv asau tathā dṛśyate iti pramityavyabhicārāt sākalyam eva sātiśayam iti tam abarthayogāt tad eva karaṇam //	The subject and the object mentioned above acquire their real relational character only through the medium of assemblage of all conditions which produces true knowledge in order to render the relation of the subject and the object with true knowledge possible. In the absence of this assemblage true knowledge does not come into being and the subject and the object of true knowledge lose their primary significance.
yat tu kim apekṣaṃ sāmagryāḥ karaṇatvam iti tat antargatakārakāpekṣam iti brūmaḥ /	How can it be an instrument, having no process? The answer to it is that it works not by an independent process of its own but by means of the processes of all the conditions included in it.
kārakāṇāṃ dharmaḥ sāmagrī na svarūpahānāya teṣāṃ kalpate sākalyadaśāyām api tatsvarūpapratyabhijñānāt //	Hence it cannot do away with their individual traits. When these conditions assemble together each one of them retains its own characteristic feature.
nanu samagryebhyaḥ sāmagrī bhinnā cet kathaṃ pṛthaṅ nopalabhyate abhede tu sarvakārakāṇi karaṇībhūtāntānyeveti kartṛkarmavyavahārocchedaprasaṅgaḥ maivam samagrasannidhānākhyadharmasya pratyakṣam upalmbhāt /	The individual property of each one is recognized. Is collocation different from the individual conditions ? If it is so then why is it not observed to be so? If it is identi- cal with the conditions then all conditions turn out to be the 25Nyayamanjari instrumental case. In that case, the usage such as a subject, an object, etc., should be abolished.
pṛthag avasthiteṣu hi sthālījalajvalanataṇḍulādiṣu na samagratāpratyayaḥ samuditeṣu tu bhavatīty ataḥ tantupaṭalaparighaṭitapaṭādyavayavivat kārakakalāpaniṣpādyadravyāntarābhāve 'pi samudāyātmikā sāmagrī vidyata eveti samudāyyapekṣayā karaṇatāṃ pratipadyate /	If the objects such as the cooking pot, water, fire, rice, etc., stand apart then the knowledge of assemblage does not arise. But when they stand together they are known to possess a common property, viz., assemblage. When many conditions assemble they possess a common property of assemblage. But in case of threads a bundle of threads being united a distinct type of assemblage comes into being. It is called a piece of cloth.
samuddāyināṃ sāmagryavasthāyām api svarūpānapāyāt samudrāyiviśeṣe karmaṇi sāmagrī karaṇam /	The piece of cloth is distinct from its constituent threads assembled. In spite of a distinction between the first and second type of assemblage an assemblage irrespective of its types exists as a matter of fact. An assemblage as compared to each of the individual members that assemble is an instrumental case.
ata eva pramiter na nirālambanatvam //	The objection, mentioned above, does not hold good.
etena pramātrādiḥ pṛthag upadarśita iti vidhācatuṣṭayam api samāhitam //	Thus the fourfold division involved in an act of true knowledge is shown to be honoured.
yat tv abhyadhāyi sāmagryāḥ karaṇavibhaktinirdeśo na dṛśyata iti tatrocyate sāmagrī hi saṃhatiḥ /	26 Another objection has been raised from the linguistic point of view that an assemblage does never take the third case ending which is indicative of the instrumental case.
sā hi saṃhanyamānavyatirekeṇa na vyavahārapadavīm avatarati tena sāmagryā paśyāmīti na vyapadeśaḥ //	An answer to it is this that the term 'assemblage' is never used independently of an assembling member. Hence in Sanskrit Literature no such usage, viz.
yas tu dīpendriyāṇāṃ tṛtīyānirdeśaḥ sa phalopajananāvinābhāvisvabhātvākhyasāmagrīsarūpasamāropaṇanibandhanaḥ /	But a lamp or a sense- organ or anyother appropriate object takes the third case-ending to convey the idea that the object denoted by the stem to which the third case-ending has been added is the instrument.
anyatrāpi ca tadrūpasamāropeṇa sthālyā pacatīti vyapadeśo dṛśyate eva /	Not only in the field of Epistemology but also in the common practice the above-mentioned condition holds good. Let us cite an illustra- tion viz.
tasmād antargatakārakāpekṣayā labdhakaraṇabhāvā sāmagrī pramāṇam //	When an assemblage acquires the character of an instrument depending upon the conditions included in it such an assemblage is the cause par excellence of true knowledge.
apare punar ācakṣate sāmagrī nāma samuditāni kārakāṇi /	27 The other critics come forward and take an exception to the above hypothesis.
teṣāṃ dvairūpyam ahṛdayaṅgamam /	The double character of the members is incomprehensible.
atha ca tāny eva pṛthag avasthitāni karmādibhāvaṃ bhajante atha ca tāny eva samuditāni karaṇībhavantīti ko 'yaṃ nayaḥ tasmāt kartṛkarmavyatiriktam avyabhicārādiviśeṣaṇakārthapramājanakam kārakaṃ karaṇam ucyate /	One of such conditions lying outside the assemblage may be an object or a subject or something else. But when they assemble together to produce an effect they become an instrumental case. What is the underlying reason behind the formulation of such a hypothesis. In the absence of a clear rational ground the sub- ject and the object should be never an instrument.
tad eva tṛtīyayā vyapadiśantidīpena paśyāmi cakṣuṣā nirīkṣe liṅgena buddhye śabdena jānāmi manasā niścinomīti //	In the Sanskrit grammar the third case-ending signifies this character of the condition in question I see with a lamp; I see with eyes; I know by means of a mark, I ascertain with the help of a word, I determine with my inner organ and so on.
nanu trīṇy eva kārakāṇy asmin pakṣe bhaveyuḥ jñānakriyāyāṃ tāvat evam evaitat yathā bhavān āha /	Now a question arises in our mind viz. 'should there be only three kinds of conditions? The reply is that in Epistemology these three types of conditions are enough and that this hypo- thesis agrees with that of yours.
pākādiktiyāsu ktiyāśrayadhāraṇādyupakārabhedaparyālocanayā bhavatv adhikaraṇādikārakāntaravyavahāraḥ /	Similarly, the other types of conditions are to be assumed in consideration of their necessary contributions towards the actualisation of an act. In the production of the effect viz.
pramitau tu manodīpacakṣurādeḥ na lakṣyate viśeṣa iti tatsarvaṃ karaṇatvena sammatam //	a piece of true knowledge no difference in the nature of contributive function is noticed among the instrumental causes mentioned above, viz.
kas teṣu tamabartha iti cet asti kaścit yad ayaṃ lokaḥ [ahaṃ mayā jānāmi] [ghaṭena ghaṭaṃ jānāmi] iti na kartṛkarmaṇī vismṛtyāpi karaṇatvena vyapadiśati nayanamanodīpaśabdaśabdaliṅgāni tu tathā vyapadiśati so 'yam eṣāṃ paśyati kartṛkarmavailakṣaṇyaṃ cakṣurādīnām /	What is the significance of the suffix 'tamap' in the effectuation of knowledge ? The answer is that there is some significance. This significance is grasped by every body. Nobody uses the subject or the object as an instrumental cause. But he rightly uses 'eyes', 'an inner organ', 'a lamp', 'a word' and 'a mark' as an instrumental cause as he notices the differences of a subject and of an object from an instrumental cause.
tadvailakṣaṇyam eva ca teṣām atiśaya iti / tad ayam iha pramāṇaṃ pramātā prameyaṃ pramitir iti caturvarga eva vyavahāraḥ parisamāpyate /	Thus we conclude that the four-fold division of true knowledge generally called a proof or a source of valid knowledge, the subject of true knowledge, its object and the act of knowing truly, is completely covered by the second hypothesis.
tasmāt kartṛkarmavilakṣaṇā saṃśayaviparyayarahitārthabodhavidhāyinī bodhābodhasvabhāvā sāmagrī pramāṇam iti yuktam //	Therefore we arrive at the final complete definition of a proof of true knowledge that is the collocation of all conditions other than a subject and an object partaking of the nature of consciousness and unconsciousness and productive of the knowledge of an object other than an error or a doubt, is the instrumental cause of true knowledge.
ye tu bodhasyaiva pramāṇatvam ācakṣate na sūkṣmadarśinas te /	An examination of the Definition of Pramāṇa of the Buddhist School These who hold that some forms of consciousness are pramāṇas lack deep insight into the Science of logic.
bodhaḥ khalu pramāṇasya phalaṃ na sākṣātpramāṇam /	Some kind of con- sciousness is the result of pramāņa but cannot be itself a direct pramâņa.
karaṇārthābhidhāno hi pramāṇaśabdaḥ pramīyate aneneti pramāṇam /	The term 'pramâna' etymologically signifies an instrument. A pramāṇa is that by which something is correctly known.
pramīyata iti ko 'rthaḥ pramā janyata iti /	What is the meaning of the predicate 'is correctly known'? The answer is that true knowledge is generated.
pramāṇād avagacchāma iti vadanto laukikāḥ karaṇasyaiva prāmānyam anumanyante / yas tu pramā pramānam iti pramāṇaśabdaḥ sa pramāṇaphale draṣṭavyaḥ /	They also lend their support to the view that an instrument is really a pramāņa. In Sanskrit literature we find that the word 'prama' is also synonymous with the word 'pramâna'. This 'pramāņa' is truly the result of pramāṇa, the instrument.
tathā ca saṃśayaviparyayātmakaṃ apramāṇaphalam api jñānaṃ ātmamano 'numāne tadviśeṣaṇārthaparicchede vā viśiṣṭapramājananāt pramāṇatāṃ pratipadyate /	Thus a piece of knowledge which is other than a doubt and an illusion is the result of a pramāņa. Such a piece of knowledge generates an inference of the soul or that of the in- ternal organ of such true knowledge as gives information about its object whether it is acceptable or avoidable.
avyabhicārādiviśeṣaṇopapannam api jñānam aphalajanakam apramāṇam eva /	But if a piece of knowledge which is neither an illusion nor a doubt does not produce another piece of true knowledge then it should not be called a pramâņa, though some thinkers wrongly call it a pramâņa.
kevalapramāsvabhāvaṃ pramāṇād vibhinnaṃ phalam iti pratyakṣalakṣaṇe vakṣyāmaḥ // atha vyatiriktaphalajanakam api bodharūpam eva pramāṇam ucyate tad ayuktam sakalajagadviditabodhetarasvabhāvaśabdaliṅgadīpendriyādiparihāraprasaṅgāt /	If we accept the view of some thinkers that knowledge is only pramana then we shall have to discard the popular view. Therefore, it should be noted that if a piece of knowledge is included in the collocation of conditions which determines a resulting consciousness then it is called a pramāņa. A number of illustrations may be cited to substantiate our point.
tasmāt sāmagryanupraviṣṭo bodhaḥ viśeṣaṇajñānam iva kvacitpratiyakṣe liṅgajñānam iva liṅgipramitau sārūpyadarśanam ivopamāne śabdaśravaṇam iva tadarthajñāne pramāṇatāṃ pratipadyate /	In case of an inference the knowledge of the mark is instrumental to the know- ledge of the object marked. In case of analogy the knowledge of similarity is an instrument of the analogical knowledge. The auditory perception of a word leads to the knowledge of the object denoted by it as an instrument.
ata eva bodhābodhasvabhāvā sāmagrī pramāṇam ity uktam //	Therefore, it is rightly stated that the collocation of conditions including both consciousness and unconscious objects is a pramāṇa.
anye tu tulyasāmagryadhīnayoḥ jñānārthayoḥ grāhyagrāhakabhāvaṃ vadantaḥ bodhaṃ pramāṇam abhyupāgaman /	Some other logicians hold that a phenomenon of consciousness which reveals an object is pramāṇa provided that the revealer and the revealed owe their existence to the same set of conditions.

A phenomenon of consciousness, the illuminator and the object, the illumined simultaneously come into being. The object in question is an effect of another antecedent momentary phenomenon of cons- ciousness and another antecedent transient object but cannot be an object of its simultaneous phenomenon of consciousness. The object in question may be an object of its immediately antecedent phenomenon of consciousness. (The driſt of this argument is that a momentary phenomenon of consciousness cannot appear as possessed of an effect, having produced no effect during its existence.
tad idam anupapannam aphalajanakasya pramāṇatvānupapatter ity uktatvāt /	Hence, another object is to be postulated. Thus we see that these assumptions will go on ad infinitum without a stop.

This cognizedness is the mark by means of which we infer consciousness. Consciousness is an act-a pro- cess.

A thing, supposed to be a cause, does not acquire the title 'cause' but only passes by its old designation unless and un- til it is related to an act. A man who runs after an effect should not search for such a thing as is not a cause. Thus, if the importance of an act be minimised then all the worldly trans- actions would collapse. In fine, he adds that as the already existent facts such as rice, water, fire, the cooking pot, etc., be- come united with a view to performing the act of cooking which was not yet existent so the soul, the sense-organ, the inner organ and the independent object being united the act of perce- ption (knowing directly an object) comes into being.

He implies that the act of awareness is not intuited since the two forms (the form of an object and that of consciousness) are not grasped. Though consciousness itself is not intuited yet itThe view of the Mimämsakas only in cases of true perception but does not hold good in cases of indirect knowledge such as inference, etc. The representative view of consciousness is also open to these charges.
na hy ekam eva sākāraṃ jñānaṃ grāhyaṃ grāhakaṃ ca bhavitum arhatīti vakṣyate // arthas tu sākārajñānavādino na samasty eva /	Even if we, for argu- ment's sake, assume the representative view of consciousness then pramăna cannot be distinct from pramiti (the result). Therefore, the hypothesis in question is absolutely untenable.
sa hy anumeyo vā syāt pratyakṣo vā nānumeyaḥ sambandhagrahaṇābhāvāt /	The causes get themselves united in order to generate an impercep- tible act.
arthe hi sati sākāraṃ nirākāraṃ tadatyaye /	A cause bears a significant name only when it is related to an act.

But when an object is known the preceding act of consciousness is inferred.

Cognizedness belonging to an object cannot be explained if the preceding act of consciousness is not presumed. Afterwards, to solve the apparent contradiction the proof is presumed. (In other words Kumärila holds that presumption establishes the existence of the act of consciousness. Both Sabara and Kumārila hold that no body is directly aware of his consciuosness).
sākārapakṣe 'pi paryanuyogasāmyam ityādi sarvaṃ upariṣṭāt savistaram abhidhāsyate /	Jayanta puts the view of Sabara in a nut-shell.

It is an inference. The mark by means of which it is in- ferred is cognizedness belonging to an object. The word 'con- sciousness' may imply a sense-organ since a sense-organ produces some forms of consciousness.
na cāsaṃsṛṣṭāni tāni phalavanti /	The primary meaning of the word 'proof' is never a sense-organ.
tataś ca na phalārthibhir upādīyeteti vyavahāravilopaḥ /	The proof in question brings about a result, viz., cognizedness belonging to an object.
tadāha bhāṣyakāraḥ [na hy ajñāne 'rthe kaścid buddhim upalabhate jñāte tu anumānād avagacchati] iti /	Though Sabara and the Buddhists agree to the point that consciousness is the proof yet they differ in certain respects.

tad eṣa phalānumeyo jñātṛvyāpāro jñānādiśabdavāyaḥ pramāṇam /	They arrive at a strange conclusion since all acts of knowing are not mediate. The judgment ‘an object is known' is an example cited by them.
indriyādīnāṃ tu tadutpādakatayā indriyavyāpāre jñānam upacarati na sākṣād iti //	Similarly, the perceptual judgment an object is known' should also presuppose the direct awareness of the awareness of the object as its antecedent condi- tion.

If you hold that the perception of an external ob- ject reveals only the object and that perception is not self- conscious, then the Buddhists who deny existence to the external objects may only be defeated. 35 The view of the Mimämsakas that consciousness is not directly introspected because it is an act is not tenable.
yat tu kriyāsvabhāvatvāt tasya parokṣatvaṃ tad ayuktam na hi kriyāsvabhāvaṃ jñānam api tu phalasvabhāvam eva //	They assume a wrong hypothesis that knowing is an act whereas it is an effect partaking of the nature of a result. Moreover, an act belonging to a perceptible substance is directly perceived.

Has it committed an offence? What is the offence of an act of knowledge that it transcends introspection? Now, they may contend that a supersensuous act belongs to the perceptible causes, over and above physical motion admitting of such -divisions as upward motion etc. But this view is not tenable.
sā hi yadi nityā jātivat athānityā rūpavat vastudharma iṣyeta / tatra yadi nityā tarhi sarvadā vastunaḥ kriyāyogāt sarvadā phalaniṣpattiprasaṅgaḥ /	Is this act eternal like a universal or non-eternal property of a substance like colour ? If it is eternal then its result should be ever present since an act always inheres in the substance.

It is true that etymological meaning of the word 'hāraka' is that what does something. But it may be argued that it does not bring about an act but only a result.
kriyā ''veśam antareṇa ca kārakatvānupapattiḥ satyaṃ karotīti yad brūṣe seyam uktaiva kriyā bhavati /	The verb 'to do' included in the body of the word 'Kāraka', directly points to an act. In the sentence 'Caitra36 Nyājamañjari weaves (Karoti) a mat' every word denotes a distinct object.
caitraḥ kaṭaṃ karotīti caitrasyaiva kaṭasyeva karotyarthasyāpratyākhyeyatvāt tatkṛtam eva caitrādīnāṃ kārakatvam ucyate nātīndriyakriyāyoganibandhanaḥ kārakabhāvaḥ kriyāyā atīndriyatvena tadyogakṛtakārakatvānadhigame vyavahāravipralopaprasaṅgāt /	It is nothing but an act. Caitra and a mat become cases because of their direct relation with this act. A reply to the counter-argument is as follows. A thing does be- come a case because of its connection with a supersensuous act since the act being transcendental no body can see a thing as a case. The detection of the case-character of an object implies the direct awareness of the connection of the act with itself.
kriyā ''veśakṛtaṃ hi tatkārakarvam anavagacchantaḥ kathaṃ phlārthinas tadupādadīran // matpakṣe kārakatvaṃ hi nāsti kiñcid atīndriyam /	How can a man, desirous of a result, make an attempt at procuring a suitable cause (a case in grammar) to serve his purpose since the case-character of a thing bound up with the connection with an act remaining ever unknown ? Jayanta holds that according to him the character of a Kāraka (a case) is not supersensuous.
kārakatvaṃ svarūpasya sahakāryādisannidhiḥ //	The case-character of a thing means the assemblage of all essential conditions.
tāvad eva viniścitya tadupādīyate 'rthibhiḥ / tad evopādadānaiś ca phalam apy adhigamyate //	The persons, desirous of a result ascertaining all these points get hold of the favourable conditions and derive the intended result.

Why do you not accept that the result is directly produced by the joint effort of the thing in question and its co-operating conditions ?"The Refutation of Mimamsaka View 37 The Mimamsakas have already raised the point that the meaning of a verb cannot be ignored.
yat tu karotyarthasyāpratyākhyeyatvād ity uktaṃ tatrocyate parispanda eva bhautiko vyāpāraḥ karotyarthaḥ /	A reply to this point is as follows: The meaning of the verb 'to do' is the act of a material object. It is virtually motion.
na hi vayaṃ parispandātmakaṃ paridṛśyamānaṃ vyāpāram apahnumahe pratikārakaṃ vicitrasya jvalanāder vyāpārasya pratyakṣam upalambhāt /	We do not deny exis- tence to motion which is visible to all. In every case we perceive various acts like the burning of fire, etc. But we deny existence to an imperceptible act.
nanu pāko nāma dhātvarthaḥ paridṛśyamānajvalanādivyāpāravyatirikta eṣitavya eva tam antareṇa phalaniṣpatter abhāvāt /	The Mimāmsakas further contend that the verb 'to cook' has a meaning which should be taken as something different from the act of burning, etc., since without its assumption the final result, viz., boiling can never be obtained.

Such a contention does not carry much weight. The purport of the contention is that the cases produce the act in question. Now two questions arise viz. (1) Do the cases jointly generate it? or (2) Does a case singly produce it? If the Mimamsakas answer the first question in the affirmative then it should be admitted that each does not singly generate it.
ekaikaniṣkriyatve ca sākalye 'pi kutaḥ kriyā // uttarasmin pakṣe pratyekam api pākakriyāyogāt kārakāntaranirapekṣād ekasmāt kārakāt phalaniṣpattiprasaṅgaḥ /	Now, if each individual case by itself is not capable of pro- ducing the act in question then how will the cases do it when they combine? If they answer the second question in the affir- mative then any one of the cases may generate it without re- ceiving co-operation from other cases.
na ca tathāvidhadhātvarhapurastaraḥ kārakāṇāṃ saṃsargaḥ //	In that case, the act, the meaning of the verb 'to cook', does not constitute the end for the realisation of which the cases combine.

Does the act come first and does the combination of cases follow it? Or does such a combi- nation come first and does the act follow it?; If the act precedes the combination in question then what is the good of admitt- ing it? If it is admitted that there is no need of combination then the result would also be brought about by them even when they stand disunited.
melanāt tu kriyāsiddhau punar ekaikam akriyam /	If they hold that the cases jointly produce the act in question then they will have to admit that none of them singly possesses an act.
tathā sati na kāṣṭhāni jvaleyuḥ puṭharād vinā //	If it is admitted then an absurd conclusion will be forced on them that the fuel will not burn unless and until it is combined with the cooking pot.
nanu piṭharād vinā kāṣṭhāni jvalanti na tu pacanti maivam saty api piṭhare jvalanty eva kāṣṭhāni nānyat kurvanti dṛśyante /	Faggots burn but do not cook. (The Mimaṁsakas mean to say that when the cases combine they produce an act which isNyayamanjari other than motion). This contention is not tenable. The said faggots burn alike when they are either combined with the cooking pot or remain alone.

If the result is independent of our will then what will be the nature of the combination of all independent objects? The free combination of cases cannot take place if the result is deter- mined.
sādhyaṃ cet phalaṃ saiva kriyā parispandavyatirikteti maivaṃ vocaḥ phalasya kriyātvānupapatteḥ /	Now, if they accept this interpretation of the result then the result is nothing but an act. In the above example, the act in question is that of cooking which is other than motion.
odanaṃ hi phalaṃ na kriyā kriyānāmni tu kriyamāṇe na vivadāmahe //	A result can- not be an act. In the above case, the result is boiled rice. It is certainly not an act.

If an act is not its meaning, then the verb will have nothing to denote. (In an indirect manner they suggest that the act of cooking is distinct from motion). A reply to this contention is being given thus :- The combined motions of all cases assembled together such as the nominative case Devadatta and others directed towards a common result constitute the act of cooking.

But when these acts combine to bring about the common result, we over- look their individual character and consider the collection of verbs as a single verb. This single verb is the verb 'to cook'.
tathā ca devadattaḥ pacatītivat kāṣṭhāni pacanti sthālī pacatīti vyapadeśo dṛśyate /	Several sages also confirm our conclusion. The people say 'Devadatta cooks' 'fuels cook', 'the pot cooks' and so on.

etena bhāvanākhyaḥ karotyarthaḥ puruṣavyāpāro vākyārtha iti yo 'bhyupagataḥ so 'pi pratyukto veditavyaḥ /	The verb 'to do' denotes it. (The literal meaning of bhāvanā is making something). Every sentence reveals it as its primary meaning. Such a view is also refuted by an argument mention- ed in the above paragraph.
na hi puruṣavyāpāraḥ kaścid upalabhyate /	No activity of the soul is noticed.

A soul becomes an agent when the quality of Kṛti (volition) inheres in it. Consciousness and other similar inner states of the soul are attributes but not acts since they are not creatures of our will.

ghaṭam iti tāvad viṣayaḥ aham ity ātmā jānāmīti tu cintyaṃ kim atra prakāśata iti /	They argue like this 'To know' is a verb. There- fore, to know denotes an action. This action, as a matter of fact, belongs to the soul.
na vyāpāraḥ parokṣatvāt /	This counter-thesis does not stand to reasons.
phalaṃ yady atra prakāśate tad eva tarhi dhātuvācyam abhyupagataṃ bhavati /	The verb 'gadi' which is included in the classical list of verbs denotes a portion of a face. Let us analyse the sentence 'I know a jar' and see what is revealed by it.
tasmān na kriyātmakaṃ jñānam //	A jar denotes theNyayamanjari object of knowledge.

Therefore, consciousness is not an act. If consciousness were an act then the commen- tator on the Mimāṁsā sūtras should not have separately men- tioned consciousness and an act. He states that as consciousness and an act are also recognized so they should be eternal.
yadi ca nityaparokṣo jñātṛvyāpāraḥ sa tarhi pratibandhāgrahaṇād anumātum api na śakyaḥ /	Moreover, if it is held that consciousness is an act then it cannot be inferred since the major premise is impossible to frame. A positive example being absent, an induction is impossible.

ātmādyanumāne kā vārtā iti cet na tatra sāmānyato vyāptigrahaṇasya saṃbhavād iti vakṣyāmaḥ /	When an induction is based upon similarity a positive example is indispensable but if it is based upon other grounds such as a universal then a positive example is not necessary. The syllogistic argument of the soul will be discussed in a subsequent section.
iha tu bāhyakārakeṣv api na tatpūrvakaṃ phalaṃ dṛṣṭam ity uktam //	We have already stated that no body has witnessed cognisedness belonging to an external object.

If illumination is a process of the subject then it requires another activity of the subject in order to be perceived since an inactive cause can produce no result.
uktam atra kriyā hy eṣā yathādarśanam iṣyatām / jñānaṃ saṃvedanaṃ ceti vidmaḥ paryāyaśabdatām //	The Nyaya view on this point has been already stated that illumination (samvedana) is a quality of the soul. You may hold that it is mental activity in accordance with your system.
saṃvedanaṃ tu jñānasya phalatvena na manmahe / arthātiśayapakṣe ca sarvasarvajñatā punaḥ //	We do not subscribe to the view that samvedana (illumi- 41Nyayamanjari nation) is the result of the knowing process since if it belongs to an object then every body should be omniscient.

In that case, samvedana itself should be an inference. It cannot be the mark of inference of a knowing process.

As there is no possibility of the third alternative so how can the result of knowing process be revealed? No body has ever experienced a case of illumination which lacks its distinctive feature.

In fine, we beg to state that the knowing process which is inferred by means of its result as a mark is not a means of proof.

When a means of proof is directed towards an object already apprehended which effect is produced by it? The answer is that it produces true knowledge. Does it repeat the same true know- ledge as has been produced by it? In that case, the answer is absurd since what has been produced cannot be reproduced.

tasmād anupalabdhārthagrāhitve tyajyatāṃ grahaḥ /	Therefore, an inferen- tial knowledge is conditioned by its real and existent object.
nanv etasmin parityakte prāmāṇyaṃ syāt smṛter api // smṛter apramāṇatvaṃ gṛhītagrāhitākṛtam /	How do you account for the origin of the mental perception in the form that one's brother will turn up to-morrow due to the causality of its existent object? The answer is that the object of the perception in question is his brother who lives in a dis- tant country.

nanu katham anarthajā smṛtiḥ tadārūḍhasya vastunaḥ tadānīm asattvāt / kathaṃ tarhi bhūtavṛṣṭyanumānaṃ nānarthajam tatra dharmiṇo 'numeyatvāt tasya ca jñānajanakasya tatra bhāvāt /	He also knows this predicate, pro- duces the perception in question. Therefore the pure mental perception (pratibhā) is not an exception to the above rule. But, in case of memory, its object is not thought of as its conditions. Take the example of the memory of a son of his dead father.
sa cānumānagrāhyo dharmī vidyata eveti nānarthajam anumānam //	The father is dead and gone and his body has been consumed by fire. There is no trace of his existence.

Therefore, memory is not conditioned by its ob- ject. Even when the object of memory exists in a distant country the existence of the object is not considered as an in- variable condition of memory.
tasmād anarthajatvena smṛtiprāmāṇyavāraṇāt /	Hence, an object of memory does not condition it.

Moreover, Jaimini himself has stated that verbal testimony is a valid source of knowledge only when it produces such a know- ledge which reveals new matter, not known before.

An Examination of other definitions of Pramana Some other Buddhists hold that Pramāņa is broadly defined to be such as does not baffle movement.
tad ukram [pramāṇam avisaṃvādi jñānam] iti //	A means of proof is that which does not frustrate the movement of a knower.

A man attains an object when he moves for it, being prompted by its illumination. The connecting link between a means of proof and the attainment of its object is a process of the former, viz., the revelation of the object. The knower attains the object but the people think that the means of proof causes him to attain it because it shows the object to him. A parallel case may be cited.
pradarśayatā hi tena so 'rthaḥ prāpito bhavati yathā hantavyaṃ prati rājñāmājñādānam eva hantṛtvam /	The people say that the king robs a man of his property though his soldiers actually do the act of his instance.

loke 'pi ca pradaiśitaṃ vastu prāpayataḥ pramāṇatvavyavahāraḥ // tac ca prāpakatvaṃ pratyakṣānumānayor ubhayor apy astīti pramāṇasāmānyalakṣaṇam //	The character of a means of proof is its capacity for leading to the attainment of an object, shown by itself, is called a means of proof. Both perception and inference partake of the character of leading to successful attainment.
tatra pratyakṣasya vastusvalakṣaṇaviṣayatvāt tasya ca kṣaṇikatvena prāptyasambhave 'pi tatsantānaprāptreḥ santānādhyavasāyajananam eva prāpakatvam /	Though it is impossible to attain it yet a phenomenon of its series is attained. Hence the mean- ing of 'leading to successful attainment' is the production of determinate perception which refers to a number of a series of objects similar to that of the basic pure sense perception.
anumānasya tv āropitārthaviṣayatve 'pi mūlabhūtavastulakṣaṇapāramparyaprabhavatvāt maṇiprabhāmaṇibuddhivat tatprāptyā prāpakatvam /	A man mistakes the rays of a gem for a gem. If he proceeds to have it even under the guidance of illusion, be attains a gem. Similarly, a man proceeding to get hold of an imaginary object under the direction of inference attains a real object.
tad idam adhyavasitaprāpakatvaṃ prāmāṇyaṃ adhyavasitasyāvastutve 'pi tanmūlavastuprāptyā nirvahati yathā 'dhyavasitaprāpakaṃ ca pramāṇam iti matam /	Though the object of determinate knowledge is un- real yet the source of imagination being real, a real object is attained. Hence, the hypothesis that a means of proof leads to the attainment of the object of determinate knowledge is proved.
ataś ca pītaśaṅkhādigrāhiṇāṃ śaṅkhādimātraprāptau satyām api na prāmāṇyam yathā 'dhyavasitasyāprāptaḥ /	Therefore, a judgment such as the conch-shell is yellow, etc. is not true though a man who proceeds to attain the object re- ferred to by the above illusory judgment gets conch-shell since48 he does not attain the object as revealed by the judgment.
avagato hi pītaś śaṅkhaḥ prāpyate ca śveta iti /	The judgment reveals a yellow conch-shell but a white conch shell is attained.
tasmād yathā 'vagatārthaprāpakatvaṃ avisaṃvādakatvaṃ prāmāṇyam iti //	Therefore the non-frustration of a means of proof signifies that a means of proof successfully leads to the attain- ment of an object as revealed by the judgment, the spring of action.

Or, 'Does it lead to the attainment of an object of a judgement ?' An inference is not directly based upon sense-perception. Hence, it is an idle talk to hold that inference leads to the attainment of an object of sense-perception. In case of perception-an object is surely revealed but is never attained since it endures only for a Kṣaṇa (the minutest unit of time).

They hold that when imagination im- poses superstructure upon reality the object imagined is unreal and that the object upon which imagination does not prevail is real.

Nescience alone solves all the difficulties which be- set the definition. It has been actually stated by them that it is a definition of the means of proof which holds good only in theAppraisal of definition of Pramāṇa - conventional world. From the metaphysical point of view the external world has no real existence. Reality behind it is con- sciousness.

It exhibits only an attitude of escapism. What is this Nescience? Is it real or unreal? The causality of Nescience should not be invoked to explain anything unless and until its nature and character are not defined. The world of differences does not owe its existence to the impressions due to Nescience.

It is such an object after which nobody strives since it is simply neglected. In that case, it should be included in the class of such objects as are to be avoided. Such a view is not reasonable. An object of neglect is experienced by us all with a peculiar trait of its own. It cannot be discarded.

A neuter person is one who is neither a male nor a female since he is known to us to be such.

Similarly, a piece of true knowledge may be simply called as conducive to the attainment of an object when it simply reveals an object.
tac ca pracaladarkāṃśujalajñāne 'pi dṛśyate //	If the definition of true knowledge is only confined within the accincts of its power of revealing its object then it will be too wide since this definition also makes room for the illusory experience of water on the locus of the bright rays of the sun, i.e., a mirage as it reveals its object.
nanu tatra viparītādhyāsāyajananād aprāmāṇyam /	Hence, it turns out to be false as it produces a con- trary judgment.

nīlajñānaṃ hi nīlaṃ prati pramāṇam nīlam idam ity anukūlavikalpopajananāt /	When we perceive a blue object the perception of a blue object is the means of proof of it since the above perception produces a judgment re- ferring to the blue object.

If you amend your definition in this manner then the de- finition of the means of proof involves much more defects. You have stated that a means of proof leads to the attainment of an object by means of a process, viz., a judgment.

If it is further contended that the knower52 Nyāyamanjari moves to attain the object because he has wrongly identified the individual object with the imaginary series when it should be acknowledged that an illusion leads to the attainment of an object.
tasmān na prāpakaṃ pramāṇam //	In that case, such a perception is not a means of proof.

Therefore, in order to frame the definition of a means of proof the character of knowledge, its product, should be accurately specified.

tad etad ahṛdayaṅgamam yo hi jānāti budhyate adhyavasyati na tasya tatphalam arthadarśanaṃ acetanatvān mahataḥ /	Cognition or apprehension or determinate knowledge is not a property of him who reveals an object. Therefore there is no co-ordination between a cause and its result.

The result of a means of proof is the revelation of an object. It does not be- long to Intellect.

In this context, the definition of the general subject-matter, its division, the definitions of its specified forms should be given.

The term 'Pramana' in close proximity of the terms Pratyakṣa (Perception), Anumana (Inference), Upamâna (Comparison) and Sabda (Verbal Testimony) points to the fourfold division of Pramāņa (means of proof).
nanu na [catvāri pramāṇāni] iti saṅkhyāvacanaḥ śabdaḥ śrūyate nāpi pratyakṣādiny evety avadhāraṇaśrutir asti /	But no term denoting the number 'four' is given there. Moreover, there isNyayamanjari no such term as 'only' is noticed to indicate the restriction imposed upon the number of the division of the means of proof.

Our answer to this question is that the number is indicated by the very meaning of the terms themselves like the sentence 'Feed three persons of the Garga family'; the sentence 'Bring Yajñadatta and Devadatta' purports to convey that only two persons are to be brought though there are no terms to indicate the number and the exclusion of the other number.
evam ihāpi [pratyakṣānumānopamānaśabdāḥ pramāṇāni] ity ukte sāmarthyāt nyūnādhikasaṅkhyāvyavacchedo 'vadhāryate ity evaṃ tāvat vibhāgāvagamaḥ //	Similarly, if it is stated that Perception, Inference, Comparison and Verbal Testimony are the means of proof then these very names by the force of their meaning suggest the exact character of the intended division, i.e., they are only four neither more nor less.
sāmānyalakṣaṇan tu pramāṇapadād eva samākhyānirvacanasāmarthyasahitād avagamyate //	The etymological mean- ing of the term 'pramāṇa' supplies us with the definition of Pramāṇa pointing to its general feature.
pramīyate yena tat pramāṇam iti karaṇārthābhidhāyinaḥ pramāṇaśabdāt pramākaraṇaṃ pramāṇam ity avagamyate /	The cause par excellence of true knowledge is called Pramana. The suffix attached to the root of 'Pramāṇa' denotes the sense of an instru- ment. Thus the cause of Pramā (true knowledge) is Pramāņa.
tac ca prāg eva darśitam //	It has been shown before.
[prasiddhasādharmyāt sādhyasādhanam upamānam] iti ca madhye sādhyasādhanagrahaṇam upādadānaḥ sūtrakāraḥ sarvapramāṇasādhāraṇaṃ rūpam idaṃ paribhāṣate yatsādhyasādhanasya pramākaraṇasya pramāṇatvam iti //	The sutra which embodies the definition of Upamāna (comparison) containing the term 'sādhya- sādhana' in the middle suggests by a linguistic device that 'sādhya-sadhana' (sadhyapramã-true knowledge) (sādhana- karaṇa-a cause-the cause of true knowledge) is the common character of all sorts of means of proof. The net result is that a cause of true knowledge is a means of proof.

arthotpannapadena phalaviśeṣaṇena smṛtijanakam avyabhicāripadena viparyayādhāyi vyavasāyātmakapadena saṃśayajanakaṃ pramāṇaṃ vyudasyate //	The term 'arthotpanna' (owing its origin to a real object) 54Division of Promāņa prevents the cause of memory from being a means of proof. The terms 'avyabhicari' excludes the source of illusion from being a means of proof.
ataś caivam uktaṃ bhavati arthaviṣayam asandigdhaṃ avyabhicāri ca jñānaṃ yena janyate tat pramāṇaṃ ity evam ekasmād eva sūtrāt sāmānyalakṣaṇaṃ vibhāgaś cāvagamyate //	This, the boiled down meaning of the whole thing amounts to this that a means of proof is the cause of such knowledge as is generated by a real object, is not doubtful and is not illusory. Thus we get the definition of a means of proof in its generic character and the division of it from a single sútra.
nanu ekasya sūtrasya vibhāgasāmānyalakṣaṇaparatvena vākyabhedaḥ / arthaiktvāc caikaṃ vākyaṃ yuktam ucyate śrutyarthadvārakānekavastusūcanaśāliṣu /	If a single sutra serves two independent purposes, viz., the division of pramāṇa and definition of pramana in its generic character then a defect in the use of a sentence is noticed. A sentence should convey a single meaning.
sūtreṣv anekārthavidheḥ vākyabhedo na dūṣaṇam //	A sentence represents a unit of thought. It should not represent two.
pramāṇāntarasaṃsparśaśūnye śabdaikagocare / prameye vākyabhedādidūṣaṇaṃ kila dūṣaṇam /	When a matter is known only by the means of verbal testimony to the exclusion of other means of proof the sentence which expresses it should have only one meaning.
arthadvayavidhānaṃ hi tatraikasya na yujyate //	In such cases only a sentence should never convey two meanings.
[rājā svārājyakāmo vājapeyena yajeta] iti guṇavidhipakṣe svārājyaṃ prati yāgo vidhātavyaḥ yāgaṃ prati ca vājapeyaguṇo vidhātavyaḥ ity ekasya vākyasya parasparaviruddhavidhyanuvādādirūpāpatteḥ arthadvayavidhānam atidurghaṭam //	The Vedic injunction is: 'A person, desirous of kingdom in the Heaven, should perform the Vája- peya sacrifice'. This injunction is an illusion of Utpatti Vidhi which simply narrates the name of a sacrifice. If we try to ex- tract two meanings from it then it will shape itself as a case of guna-vidhi as well. A guṇavidhi significs merely a guņa (a subsidiary element) of the main action already enjoined by a precious injunction.
iha punaḥ pramāṇāntarapariniścitārthasūcanacāturyamahārgheṣu sūtreṣu nānārthavidhānaṃ bhūṣaṇaṃ bhavati na dūṣaṇam /	But the precious sūtras ingeniously indicate a lot of meanings which have been already determined by the different sources of knowledge. But it is a glorious feat on the part of the sutras that they yield manifold meanings.
anekārthasūcanād eva sūtram ucyate /	It is called a sutra because it indicates many a meaning.
etad eva sūtrakārāṇāṃ paraṃ kauśalaṃ yat ekenaiva vākyena svalpair evākṣaraiḥ anekavastusamarpaṇam / adhyāhāreṇa vā tantreṇa vā āvṛttyā vā tam arthaṃ pratyāyayiṣyati sūtram idam iti na doṣaḥ //	This is really an excellent device adopted by the authors of the sutras that they give the readers to under- stand a good deal of things by means of a single sentence con- taining a minimum number of syllables. The device, adopted by them to indicate so many meanings, is as follows:--the filling up of the understood, the use of one to serve multiple purposes and repetition of a word. The sutras follow a set of rules to convey so many meanings.

But there is a rule that the definition of the species must follow the divi- sion of its genus and its definition. A single sūtra may simul- taneously discharge both functions, viz., division and definition by means of tantra (serving many a purpose). The definition of a species is not possible if the corresponding genus remains undefined.
sāmānyalakṣaṇavibhāgayos tu yathāruci pratipādanam ādau vibhāgaḥ tataḥ sāmānyalakṣaṇam ādau vā sāmānyalakṣaṇaṃ tato vibhāgaḥ /	We may at first divide it into species and then define it. Or, we may at the outset, define it and then divide it into species as in the case of Siddhanta (tenet) and chala (wrangling). Or, we may simultaneously define it and divide it into species.
siddhāntacchelavad ubhayaṃ vā yugapad eva pratipādyate iti tantreṇa āvṛttyā vā tadupapādane na kaścid doṣa iti //	In order to do it if the device of tantra (serving many purposes be one and the same thing) or the device of avṛtti (the repetition of something) is adopted then it suffers from no defect.

But it is difficult to prove the above thesis. There are many hypotheses on the point at issue.

How do you come to the conclusion that the means of proof only admits of fourfold division? A reply to this question is as follows.
śabdasya cānumānavailakṣaṇyaṃ tallakṣaṇāvasa eva vakṣyata iti śākyapatho 'pi na yuktaḥ //	We shall point out the difference of the verbal testimony from inference when we shall subsequently define verbal testimony.

They hold that the means of proof admits only of two kinds since the knowable objects are only of two types and the difference in the type of knowable objects alone accounts for the variety of the means of proof.

so 'pi hi rāśiḥ nīlasaṃvidi bhāti na vā bhāti cen nīlam eva syāt na prakārāntaraṃ tu tat / no cet tathā 'py anīlaṃ syāt na prakārāntaraṃ hi tat //	Is the third type an object of the awareness of a blue object or not? If you say 'Yes' then it is nothing but a blue object. If you say 'No' then it is nothing but a non- blue object. There is no such object as is neither blue or non- blue.
idam eva hi nīlānīlayor lakṣaṇam yat nīlajñānāvabhāsyatvānavabhāsyatve nāma //	How do we define a blue object ? An object which is revealed by the awareness of a blue object is blue.

An object of perception is perceptible. An object which is not an object of perception is imperceptible. The pssibility of the third type of objects is also excluded.

But it should be admitted that perceptual judgements which follow in its wake determine the object, exclude it from its negation and preclude the possibility of the third alternative;Division of Pramāṇas: Buddhist hypothesis 59 otherwise, all practical transactions would collapse. If it be so, the relation of contradictory opposition existing between an object of perception and its non-object is known to us since per- ception reveals its object as absolutely excluded from its non- object.

It is not reasonable to hold that the verbal testimony also like an inference reveals a universal which is imperceptible.I 60 One and we same object should not be revealed by more than one means of proof since they would oppose each other to secure the priority of appearance and either of them would be redun- dant. If the second means of proof knows an object in the same way as the first one has done, then the services of the second one are futile.

The Buddhists cannot, also, hold that an awareness is self-lumí- nous since if an awareness be an object of its own self then it will be no better than ordinary objects, e.g., blue, yellow, etc, We shall subject the hypothesis of the self-luminous character of an awareness to an elaborate and severe criticism when the thesis of subjective Idealism will be refuted.

Hence, inference and perception can never have a common object. How can the hypothesis of the appli- cation of many means of proof to a common object be possible? How can the Buddhist theory of inference be open to the charge of a regressus ad infinitum ? This statement is merely a hoax.

Does it belong to reality? Or66 does it belong to an imaginary image? It cannot belong to an imaginary object.
vastu vastunā janyate vastu ca vastumvabhāvaṃ bhavet /	A real object is always produced by a real object. A real object is only identical with a real object.

But two general images which are ima- ginary beings play the part of a probans and a probandum. Thus the relation in question exists on one locus but something else is the source of its knowledge. The object inferred is one thing but a man who infers moves for another and attains an object other than the inferred one. All this is mere deception and nothing else.
na ca dṛśyasaṃsparśaśūnyātmanāṃ vikalpānāṃ darśanacchāyā kācana saṃbhavati /	Moreover, a concept is in no way related to a real object. Hence, it cannot bear a close resemblance to a perceptual image.
apramāṇaparicchinnaḥ pratibandhaś ca tattvataḥ / na paricchinna eveti tato mithyā 'numeyadhīḥ // athābhimatam evedaṃ buddhyārūḍhatvavarṇanāt /	Hence, thinness and vividness which are asserted of concepts do not impart validity to them since they are far away from the domain of reality. The induction from the Buddhist point of view is not based upon sound proof. It is a mere conjecture.

If the perception of a universal is not assumed then the relation of invariable concomitance cannot be discovered. Hence, the cause of inference is very much weakened. Moreover, one who discovers the relation of invariable concomitance cannot perceive the probans (a mark) for the second time.

The Buddhists argue against the application of the plurality of proofs on the ground that an assumption like this contradicts other assumptions and is redundant.

The Buddhists may explain the contra- dictory nature in this way that if perception, inference and ŞNyayamanjari verbal knowledge have a common object then the knowledge of it should have been similar (i e.

Its separate treatment suggests that presumption in this case solves apparent contradictions which is noticed in the matter brought in only by the verbal testimony. Hence its object is different from those of other five forms of power presumption. Let us cite an example of presumption based upon percep- tion.

Or shall we infer the pre- sence of Caitra on the outside which is other than a house? But a mark which is suitable for the purpose is not available. None of the following marks such as Caitra absent from a house, containing the negation of Caitra; the negation of Caitra in his house; or non-perception of Caitra in his house belongs to the subject of inference.
na hi gṛhaṃ vā caitro vā tadabhāvo vā tadadarśanaṃ vā caitrasya dharmaḥ tadbahirbhāvasya vety apakṣadharmatvād anyatamasyāpi na liṅgitvam //	Neither Caitra's house nor Caitra nor the negation of Caitra nor non-perception of Caitra belongs to either Caitra or to his existence outside his house, Hence, none of them is a genuine mark.
api ca prameyānupraveśaprasaṅgād api nedam anumānam /	Hence, it is not a case of inference. The argument, put forward by the Mimamsakas, is as follows.

The awareness of the negation of Caitra in his house is necessary for the inference of his existence outside his house, since no probans, if it is not cognized, leads to the knowledge of the connected probandum, the awareness of the negation of an object arises when all the means of proof fail to cognize the object negated.
iha tu sadupalambhakam asty eva jīvanagrāhi pramāṇam /	But in the case of the point at issue there is the means of proof which cognizes his life.
jīvanaṃ hi kvacid astitvam ucyate /	His life means his exis- tence somewhere.

The means of proof of his existence being at work, solves the contradiction between his simultaneous existence and non- existence. It restricts his non-existence to his house and his existence to the space outside his house. When we know for certain that Caitra who is alive exists somewhere outside his house we come to know his absence from his house.
anumāne tu dhūmādiliṅgagrahaṇasamaye na manāg api tadanumeyadahanaliṅgyanupraveśasparśo vidyata iti //	On the contrary, in the case of an inference when we know probans, viz., smoke, we have not the slightest knowledge of the probandum, i.e., fire.

'Certainly not is the reply given by the Mīmāmsakas. The Mimāṁsakas further add in support of their view that presumption corroborates the findings of the two independent means of proof, viz., verbal knowledge and non-perception which grasp the existence and the non-existence of the same object, viz., Caitra. It simultaneously reveals the exis- tence and the non-existence of the above object, i.e., Caitra. The verbal testimony indefinitely speaks of his existence.
ataś ca yeyam āgamād aniyatadeśatayā kvacid astīti saṃvittir abhūt saiveyaṃ gṛhābhāve gṛhīte bahir astīti saṃvittir adhunā saṃvṛttā /	We know that he exists somewhere. But when we know for certain that he is absent from his house, we also definitely know that he lives somewhere outside his house.
tad ato vailakṣaṇyāt nānumānam arthāpattiḥ //	A presumption is not an inference because of this distinctive feature.
ataś caivaṃ sambandhagrahaṇābhāvāt bhāvābhāvau hi naikena yugapad vahnidhūmavat /	But in the case of presumption the relation of invariable concomitance holding between presence outside a house and absence from a house cannot be grasped by a single means of proof.

anyathā 'nupapattyā ca prathamaṃ pratibandhadhīḥ /	But in this wayNyayamanjari the relation of invariable concomitance holding between an object negated and its negation can never be discovered.
paścād yady anumānatvaṃ ucyate kāmam ucyatām // nanv asty eva gṛhadvāre vartinaḥ saṅgatigrahaḥ /	When we see that Caitra is present in his house we conjec- ture that we cannot account for his stay at home if he is not absent from other places.

yatra gṛhe caitrasya bhāvam avagamya tadanyathā 'nupapattyā tadanyadeśeṣu nāstitvam avagamyate tatra deśānām ānantyāt duradhigamaḥ pratibandhaḥ //	We cannot see all the places other than his house and come to know that he is absent from each of them. In this case, generalization, based upon observation, is impossible since the places are innumerable.

The reply of the Mimamsakas to this question is that the method of agree- ment contributes much to arrive at the required induction that smoke is the invariable concomitant of fire but exclusive use of the method of difference to arrive at the said induction is not worth trying. If we arrive at the correct generalization repe- atedly observing the positive instances then why should we run after negative instances to arrive at the same truth in a roundabout manner? In the present case, whenever we try to establish the relation of concomitance holding between Caitra and his absence in a general way we realise the real difficulty which besets it. The absence of Caitra cannot be abstricted from its locus.

'No' is our reply. The reason is as follows: When we know negation by means of non-perception we know it as located upon a particular well- defined locus.
kauśāmbyās tvayi niṣkrānte tatpraveśādiśaṅkayā //	But the negation of Caitra belongs to all places excepting his house.
tasmād abhūmir iyam asarvajñānām ity arthāpattyaiva tan niścayaḥ //	Hence it cannot be known by non-percep- tion. The objector may urge that he will roam about from one place to another in order to know the negation of Caitra by means of non-perception.

The argument is as follows: All the other places contain the negation of Caitra because they are other than the place occupied by Caitra like the place in the vicinity of his house. Such an argument is set at naught by a counter-argument. The other places are not distinct from such places as contain his negation because they are distinct from the place which is very close to his house like his own house.
tasmān niyatadeśopalabhyamānaparimitaparimāṇapuruṣaśarīrānyathā 'nupapattyaiva taditarasakaladeśanāstitvāvadhāraṇaṃ tasyeti siddhaṃ //	That is why it should be presumed that his negation exists in all places not occupied by him. Hence, the negation of Caitra under discussion is only ascertained by means of presumption.

Whenever we hear an incomplete sentence but gather its sense with the aid of some portion not given, the knowledge of such portion is a distinct type of knowledge since it is due to none of the accepted means of knowledge such as perception, etc.
na pratyakṣaṃ kṣapābhakṣaṇapratītikṣamam parokṣatvāt /	The above knowledge is not direct since the taking of meal at night (supper) is beyond the range of our vision.

atra ca rātryādipadānām aśravaṇāt apadārthasya vākyārthatvānupapatteḥ /	Moreover, in the above case, as long as the words such as 'At night he takes, etc.' are not heard the meaning, conveyed by the understood words, cannot consti- tute the meaning of the given sentence.
na ca vibhāvarībhojanalakṣaṇo 'rthaḥ divāvākyapadārthānāṃ bhedaḥ saṃsargo vā yenāyam apadārtho 'pi pratīyeta //	Moreover, the meaning.76 Nyāyamanjari of the understood words, viz., 'the taking of supper' is neither a necessary element of the meaning of the given sentence nor in- separably related to it so that it invariably flashes in our mind even if it is not conveyed by the given words.
tasmāt kalpyāgamakṛtaṃ naktamattīti vedanam /	Therefore the knowledge that he takes his supper at night is based upon an authoritative sentence which is assumed by us.

Moreover, it is almost impossible to find out a mark which will be an invariable concomitant of those words which are eternal but transcendental.

na cātra dharmaḥ kaścid upalabhyate yas tena tadvān parvata ivāgnimān anumīyate //	More- over, we find here no such property as can be proved by means of the probans in question just as we prove that a hill is fiery be- cause it is smoky.

If the sentence containing the phrase 'at night' (i. c., the sentence that he takes his meal at night) is not heard then how can it be grasped as belonging to the subject of inference? But if it is heard then there is no need of inferring it.Presumption of the Bhaṭṭa School It is highly impossible to hold that the meaning of the sen- tence that Devadatta who is bulky does not take his meal during the day serves the purpose of a probans in connection with the inference in question.
padārthānāṃ hi sāmānyātmakatvāt viśeṣam antareṇānupapattiḥ syāt na vākyāntaram antareṇa /	Words denote universals. It will be an absurdity if they be- long to no particulars. But there will be no inconsistency.

For this reason the sentence which is being heard implies a syntactical relation to some part of it not given here but as it stands in itself it falls to convey a consistent meaning. Hence, the given sentence implies it as a grammatical necessity.
nanu arthād eva katham arthāntaraṃ kalpyate pīvaratvaṃ hi nāma bhojanakāryam upalabhyamānaṃ svakāraṇaṃ bhojanaṃ analam iva dhūmaḥ samupasthāpayatu /	Why should not the meaning of the above complementary sentence be enough to communicate the mean- ing of the incomplete sentence? The bulky size is the effect of the taking of nocturnal food. The effect in question being experienced should lead to the inference of its cause, viz., the taking of food just as smoke, being perceived, is a means to the inferential knowledge of fire.

Moreover, the sentence which is presumed is only for the understanding of the proper meaning of the sentence in ques- tion but not for acquiring merit. No body should find fault with the hypothesis that the meaning is directly presumed but not through the medium of the sentence which conveys it. Why should a partition in the shape of a sentence be allowed to intervene between the two meanings directly and indirectly acquired?78 The Mimamsakas give a reply to the above objection.
pramāṇataiva na hy asya sākāṅkṣajñānakāriṇaḥ // puro 'vasthitavastvaṃśadarśanaprāptinirvṛti /	A sentence which conveys a complete meaning is only a source of valid knowledge since an incomplete sentence conveys no meaning, being not self-sufficient.
vākyārthe hi samagrāṅgaparipūraṇasuthita / avidhāya dhiyaṃ nāsya vyāpāraḥ paryavasyati //	A sentence is a complete whole in which each of its consti- tuents (i.e., parts of speech) fulfills its duty and tends to convey the meaning of the sentence.
tāvantaṃ bodham ādhāya prāmāṇyaṃ labhate vacaḥ /	A sentence which expresses a complete meaning is a source of valid knowledge.
tadarthavācakatvāc ca tadvākyaṃ vākyam iṣyate // śabdaikadeśaśrutyā 'taḥ tadaṃśaparipūraṇam /	Such a sentence bears a significant name. Therefore whenever we hear a portion of a sentence we should fill up the gap supplying the understood portion by our imagi- nation.
kalpyaṃ prathamam arthasya kutas tena vinā gatiḥ //	How can we get at the complete and consistent mean- ing if the understood portion is not supplied ? In many cases, the Vedic injunctions are incomplete.
prāyaḥ śrutārthāpattyā ca vedaḥ kāryeṣu pūryate /	By means of presumption, based upon testimony, they are made complete.
tatrārthaḥ kalpyamānas tu na bhaved eva vaidikaḥ //	But, in these cases if we do not complete the Vedic injunctions which enjoin rites then the sense of the clause to be inserted, being merely implied, will not be strictly Vedic.
yo mantrair aṣṭakāliṅgaiḥ tadviddhiḥ parikalpyate / śrutir liṅgādibhir yā ca kalpyate viniyojikā //	The Vedic mantra (a prayer) which speaks of a kind of ceremony in honour of the departed ancestors (aṣṭakā by name) leads us to assume an injunction which enjoins aṣṭakā.
viśvajityadhikāraś ca yāgakartavyatāśruteḥ / utpattivākyaṃ sauryādāv adhikāravidhiśruteḥ //	Sometimes, we also assume a complete Vedic injunction on the basis of an incomplete injunction. The Vedic injunction one should perform 'Viśvajit sacrifice' is an instance of an incomp- lete Vedic injunction.
aindrāgnādivikāreṣu kāryamātropadeśataḥ /	The injunction does not contain a word which denotes the enjoyer of the fruit of the action.
yaś ca prakṛtivadbhāvo vidhyanta upapādyate //	But a man who is aware of the fruit of the rite and intends to have it is persuaded to do it.
tad evamādau sambandhagrahaṇānupapattitaḥ /	Hence, the above injunction should be supplemented by the word ‘svargakāmaḥ' (desirous of heaven).
śrutārthāpattir evaiṣā niśapatnaṃ vijṛmbhate // tayā śrutyaikadeśaś ca sarvatra parikalpyate /	By means of this proof, the words which are not heard but form part and parcel of the incomplete sentence heard by us, are supplied.
arthakalpanapakṣe tu na syād vedaikagamyatā //	But if it is held that the objects, denoted by these words, are to be assumed but not the words then these objects cannot enjoy the sanctíty which is shared by the meanings of the actual Vedic words.
ity arthāpattir uktaiṣā ṣaṭpramāṇasamudbhavā /	The net result of this discussion is that presumption, based upon six sources of valid knowledge, should be accepted as a source of valid know- ledge.
eṣā vicāryamāṇā tu bhidyate nānumānataḥ //	But on the contrary, presumption, if carefully examin- ed, is not distinct from inference.
pratibandhād vinā vastu na vastvantarabodhakam / yaṃ kañcidartham ālokya na yaḥ kaścit pratīyate // pratibandho 'pi nājñātaḥ prayāti matihetutām /	No person can know another object on the basis of the knowledge of an object. Moreover, the relation of invariable concomitance may exist between the two objects but if one does not know it to be such then he cannot infer the other, simply knowing one of the two.
na sadyojātabālādeḥ udbhavanti tathā dhiyaḥ //	It should also be noted that a new born baby does not possess such a complicated process of knowledge.
na viśeṣātmanā yatra saṃbandhajñānasaṃbhavaḥ /	In all cases of presumption it is not possible to know the specific relationNyayamanjari existing between the two objects.
tatrāpy asty eva sāmānyarūpeṇa tadupagrahaḥ //	But it is also a fact that they are known to be related in a general manner.
api ca tena vinā nopapadyata iti kalpanam arthāpattiḥ /	80 Moreover, the Mīmāṁsakas hold that in a case of presump- tion the proof that it (the given) cannot be established with- out this (the assumed solvent) is an instance of negative concomitance.
tena vinā nopapadyata iti ca vyatirekabhaṇitiriyam /	Hence, presump- tion is not other than inference.
vyatirekaś ca pratītaḥ tasmin saty upapadyate ity anvayam ākṣipati /	We shall prove that what is based upon the observation of negative instances becomes the probans when it is also grounded upon the observation of positive instances.

Refutation of the Power of Cause An effect which is produced only by its cause assisted by its conditions does not presuppose the supersensuous power of the cause for its coming into being.
svarūpād udbhavat kāryaṃ sahakāryupabṛhmitāt / na hi kalpayituṃ śaktaṃ śaktim anyām atīndriyām //	The Mimamsakas contend that the so-called cause is not a real cause if it is devoid of power to produce an activity.
nanu śaktim antareṇa kārakaṃ kārakam eva na bhavet /	(In other words, what is capable of producing an activity is a But what lacks it is not a cause).
yathā pādapaṃ chettumanasā paraśurudyamyate tathā pādukādyudyamyeta /	When a person intends to cut down a tree he lifts up an axe. But likewise he might have raised a shoe to do it.
śakter anabhyupagame hi dravyasvarūpāviśeṣāt sarvasmāt sarvadā sarvakāryodayaprasaṅgaḥ /	If its capacity for doing an action is not admitted then any cause would have produced any effect without any restriction since the essence of all sub- stances is one and the same.

How does one account for it without81 Refutation of the hypothesis of Sakti subscribing to the hypothesis of power? Because the essence of the cause and the assemblage of conditions are not obstructed by the recitation of incantations.

That is why the effect does not come into being in spite of the fact that the cause remains unchanged and all the conditions assemble. Moreover, it is also observed by us that even when two persons have service of the same status and draw the same pay they have differences in their enjoyments of life.
ataḥ śaktir atīndriyā tathā 'bhyupagamyatām iti //	If you follow the same line of thinking then you have to subscribe to hypothesis of transcendental power.

Let us now subject this hypothesis to a thorough scrutiny. We are not competent enough to frame a novel hypothesis of causality concerning the positive objects but follow the traditional view in our theory and practice.
na hy asmadicchayā āpaḥ śītaṃ śamayanti kṛśānur vā pipāsām //	By our mere wish neither water does warm us during chill nor fire does quench our thirst.

Either we discover the relation in question or we learn it from the ex- perienced persons. When we discover it we have recourse to the joint method of agreement and difference. That is why when we intend to cut down a tree we take up an axe but not a shoe etc.

As the conditions do not always accompany a cause so the effect does not come into being even in the presence of a cause.
sahakārivarge ca dharmādikam api nipatati tadapekṣe kāryotpāde kathaṃ sarvadā tatsaṃbhavaḥ dharmādharmayoś ca jagadvaicitryakāryabalena kalpanam aparihāryam /	If the assemb- absolutely necessary for the lage of such conditions isNyāyamanjari appearance of an effect then how we can contend that an effect must always appear because the mere cause is present. The hypothesis of merit and demerit should be admitted, other- wise, we fail to explain the variety of effects.
tayoś ca na śaktitvād atīndriyatvam api tu svarūpamahimnaiva manaḥparamāṇvādivat //	It is not a fact that they are transcendental because they represent cosmic force. But they are so because of their innate nature just like an internal organ and an atom.

kācid dhi sāmagrī kasyacit kāryasya hetuḥ //	According to them the only possible explanation is that the power of the cause is obstructed under such circumstances.
svarūpaṃ tadavastham eveti cet yady evaṃ abhikṣitam api viṣaṃ kathaṃ na hanyāt tatrā ''syasaṃyogādyapekṣaṇīyam astīti cet mantrābhāvo ' py apekṣyatām /	(They mean to say that the presence of a negative condition is also essential for the appearance of an effect but with the utterance of the incan- tation, mentioned above, the negative condition disappears from the scene).
śaktipakṣe 'pi vā mantraya ko vyāpāraḥ mantreṇa hi śakter nāśo vā kriyate pratibandho vā na tāvat nāśaḥ mantrāpagame punastatkāryadarśanāt //	What does the person do, uttering the incantation if he does not counteract the power in question? No, he has not obstructed the power but has simply introduced a change into the very collocation of conditions, nay, he has replaced the old collocation by a new one.
svarūpam asty eva dṛśyamānatvāt iti cet śaktir apy asty eva punaḥ kāryadarśanenānumīyamānatvād iti //	We should also bear in mind that a particular collocation of conditions is responsible for a particular effect and hence the effect in question does not appear.

Does it destroy power or does it counteract its influence ? Certainly, it does not destroy power since with the disappearance of the influence of the incanta- the cause is seen. If it tion in question the effect of is held that power is counteracted then the Naiyãyikas will also argue that the cause itself is likewise prevented from producing its effect.

Hence, they postulate the hypothesis of only one power and hold that the logical problem of a regressus ad infinitum does not arise.
āha dṛṣṭasiddhaye hy adṛṣṭaṃ kalpyate na tu dṛṣṭavighātāya /	If a visible object is otherwise explained then there is no necessity of assuming an invisible object.

Now, the Naiyāyikas point out that if one of these two hypotheses of invisible objects explains facts i.e., an effect to the satisfaction of all, then why should the Mimāriisakas assume two invisible objects, violating the law of parsimony? The Mimamsakas contend that if a so- called cause which is possessed of power does not produce its effect in and through its intermediate process then it is not a real cause.
yat anavasthāṃ nāvaheta dharmādivat //	The Naiyāyikas put a question to them.

They may say in reply that they infer it from its effect. The Naiyāyikas take an exception to it that an effect owes its existence only to an intermediate process but not to power.

If the cause-in-itself is not sufficient enough to bring about its effect then and then only we should infer something else in addition to the presupposed cause in order to explain an effect and this may be called 'power'.

The fact that a man is living is one thing but, on the other hand, the fact that he is staying outside his house is another thing. Moreover, it cannot be also held that the know- ledge of the absence of a living person from his house is the same as the knowledge of that person staying outside his house.
nanu dhūmād anya eva dahanaḥ ihāpi gṛhābhāvañivanābhyām anya eva bahirbhāvaḥ //	Smoke is different from fire. In this case, too, the absence of a living person from his house is distinct from his presence outside his house.

We infer only their relation which is a novel object. Similarly, here too, the connection of the living person with the place outside his house is only inferred since it is such an object as known before.

tasmāt prameyāntarasadbhāvāt tasya ca tadānīm ananupraveśāt na prameyānupraveśo doṣaḥ //	An unknown object is not revealed by presumption which reveals only the postulated object. Hence, presumption reveals no new object.

The object which is postulated is never denoted by a word.
tasya tasmāt pratītir iti yatra vyavahāraḥ tatrāvaśyaṃ tatpratītau tadanupraveśo doṣa eva /	But whenever an object is supposed to solve a contra- diction it is known. Presumption reveals only the postulated object known already.

Hence, presumption is not a distinct source of knowledge.

The adjective phrase 'otherwise, not logi- cally valid' qualifies a probans in case of inference. For example, smoke cannot logically exist on the subject of inference if fire does not exist there. But in case of presumption reverse is the order subsisting between the implier and the implied.
yataḥ sā kalpnā prameyadvārikā 'nyathā 'nupapadyata ity arthaḥ /	It cannot be proved that a living per- son is staying outside if he is not absent from his house.

If one possesses the previous knowledge of the object then what is the good of exposing the puzzling character ? Because we have de- finitely known the object which we are now trying to know in this context. The Prābhākaras may contend that we have already known not merely the object but also the puzzling character without assuming such and such indicator.

If they say that the presence of a living person outside is impossible without his absence from house then they should also admit that if he is absent from his house then he is surely present outside his house. What is the nature of this impossibility? If it is logical impossibility then the so-called presumption is no better than inference since the latter thought- process moves in a similar manner.
utpattis tu gṛhābhāvāt bahirbhāvasya durbhaṇā / prāksiddhe hi gṛhābhāve tadutpādaḥ kṣaṇāntare // kāraṇaṃ pūrvasiddhaṃ hi kāryotpādāya kalpate /	It is a wrong statement that the absence of living person from his house objectively determines his presence outside. If the absence from house is an established fact then its effect is sub- sequently produced by it since a cause is invariably antecedent to its effect.
tasmād yatkiñcid etat //	Such a cause alone is productive of its effect.

In case of inference smoke is only the mark of fire but in case of presump- tion the absence from house indicates and produces presence outside.
yat tu sambandhagrahaṇābhāvād ity uktaṃ tad api na sundaram mandiradvāravartinas tadutpatteḥ //	Moreover, the Mimām- sakas have already pointed out that the relation of invariable concomitance holding between the implier and the implied can in no way be discovered since a relation is discovered when the objects thus related are within the range of vision.
etac ca svayam āśaṅkya na taiḥ pratisamāhitam /	Such an argu- ment does not make an appeal to us.
udāharaṇam anyat tu vyatyayena pradarśitam //	Hence, they have put forward another example to prove their thesis.
gṛhabhāvena bahirabhāvakalpanam iti tatraitad eva vaktavyam /	But if they think that it is a better one then they should have given it at the outset.
iyam abhāvapūrvikā na bhavaty evārthāpattiḥ /	But it does not illustrate presumption based upon non-perception.
ṣaḍarthāpattiḥ pratijñāya imām abhāvapūrvikāṃ arthāpattim uktvā upanaiyyāyikakesarikaṭākṣapātabhītāṃ iha gahane hariṇīm iva yad upekṣya gamyate tad atyantam atrabhāvatām anārthajanocitaṃ ceṣṭitam // tvadekaśaraṇāṃ bālām imām utsṛjya gacchataḥ / kathaṃ te tarkayiṣyanti mukham anyā api striyaḥ // bhāvenābhāvakalpanā tu pratyakṣapūrvikaivārthāpattiḥ /	But they, cowed down with fear at the angry look of the Naiyāyikas, have taken to heels, deserting presump- tion based upon non-perception like a doe in a forest. Such an act, on their part, is extremely mean and unworthy of a noble man, If you desert this young lady (in the shape of the former illustration of presumption) who absolutely depends upon you for her protection then how will the other ladies (the other illustrations of presumption) count upon your protec- tion with confidence ? If a negative fact is presumed on the basis of positive fact90 then it is an illustration of presumption based upon percep- tion.
tasyā api ca na duravagamaḥ sambandhaḥ /	But in that case it is not difficult to discover the relation of invariable concomitance holding between the above two facts.
asarvagatasya dravyasya niyatadeśavṛtter akleśena taditaradeśanāstitvāvadhāraṇāt /	The simple reason is that an object of limited extension occupies only a portion of space and hence in the other spaces its negation can be easily known.

As you decide with regard to this example so we decide with regard to your example of presumption.
mama tv adṛṣṭimātreṇa gamakāḥ sahacātiṇaḥ //] iti kathayitum ucitam /	Now, the Mīmāṁsakas may contend that inference is based only upon the positive concomitance discovered in and through repeated observations.
aniścitavyatirekasya sādhyaniścayābhāvād iti darśayiṣyāmaḥ // pakṣadharmānvayavat vyatireko 'pi nāgṛhīto 'numānāṅgam /	But the Naiyāyikas hold that a mark which is either positively or negatively related to the probandum is conducive to latter's inference provided that the probandum in question is not already known.
bahirbhāvasiddhau cānumānaprayogaḥ sa eva yas tvayā darśitaḥ /	We shall prove later on that there are cases of inference in which the knowledge of the negative concomi- tance is essential.
tasya tu pratiprayogaḥ pratyakṣādiviruddhatvāt hetvābhāsa evety alaṃ prasaṅgena // śrutārthāpattir api varākī nānumānāt bhidyate /	If we do not ascertain the positive and negative relations of the probans belonging to the subject of inference before the actual act of infering then we are not sure of the truth of an induction which leads to a deduction.
vacanaikadeśakalpanāyā anupapannatvāt arthasya ca kāryaliṅgagamyasya sattvāt /	It is really absurd to presume the part of sentence since the meaning of the absent part can be inferred from its effect which serves the purpose of a true mark.

ko 'tra viśeṣaḥ /	We notice no difference in these two instances.
tatkāryatayā bhūyodarśanataḥ pratipannatvāt /	From our repeated observations we have learnt that corpulence is the effect of the taking of meal.
liṅgasya tu kvacit pratyakṣeṇa grahaṇam kvacit vacanataḥ pratipattir iti naiṣa mahān bhedaḥ /	In some cases the mark is perceiv- ed but in other case it may be known by means of the verbal knowledge. There is no great gulf of difference fixed between these two marks, acquired by the two different sources of knowledge.
nanu vacanam aparipūrṇam iti pratītim eva yathocitāṃ janayitum asamartham kiṃ [pīno devadatto divā na bhuṅkte] ity ato na bhavati tatpīnatāpratītiḥ na na bhavati sākāṅkṣā tu bhavati /	The Mimamsakas contend that an incomplete sentence can- not convey its meaning. They do not mean to say that the sentence that corpulent Devadatta does not take his meal dur- ing the day fails to convey that he is corpulent but simply intends to suggest that the knowledge of his corpulence is condi- tional and that it involves a reference to its condition which is not given there. This hypothetical knowledge, being incomp- lete, is not a true one.
na ca sākāṅkṣapratītikāriṇas tasya pramāṇyam iti tad eva tāvat pūrayituṃ yuktam //	e., the sentence, is not a means of true knowledge. Hence, the sentence in question should be made complete.
tad asat kasyātra sākāṅkṣātvam kiṃ śabdasya kiṃ vā tadarthasya uta svittadavagamasya iti śabdasya tāvad arthanirapekṣasya na kācid ākāṅkṣā anabhivyaktaśabdavat // arthas tu sākāṅkṣas san arthāntaram upakalpayatu ko 'vasaro vacanakalpanāyāḥ avagamo 'py arthaviṣaya eva sākāṅkṣo bhavati na śabdaviṣayaḥ śrotrakaraṇakaḥ /	Such a contention is not tenable. Now let us see which one of the following invol- ves reference to something else. Is it a word or its meaning or its knowledge? If it is held that a word involves a reference then it may be answered that as no inarticulate sound involves a reference so a word which does not refer to a meaning in- volves no reference to some other word. If it is further held that a word which refers to its meaning also involves a refe- rence to some other word then the hypothesis requires further clarification.
tasmād avagamanairākāṅkṣyasiddhaye tadarthakalpanam eva yuktam /	Hence, it will be a simpler course to be adopted by us if we directly assume the additional objects themselves.
vacanaikadeśakalpanam api arthāvagatiddhayartham eveti tatkalpanam evāstu kiṃ sopānāntareṇa yat tu kalpyamānasyārthasyāvaidikatvaṃ prāpnotīti tatra vacanakalpanāpakṣe sutarām avaidikaḥ so 'rthaḥ syāt kalpyamānasya vacanasya vedād anyatvāt //	What benefit do we derive, having recourse to the additional step? Now, the Mimāṁsakas raise an objection that what is assumed does not follow from the Vedas. But the objection may be met thus :- Even if we assume for the sake of an argument that a clause or a sentence is presumed then the meaning of the clause or of the sentence is not conveyed by the same since either of them is non-Vedic.
śrutaḥ anumitaś ca dvividhaḥ sa veda eveti cet śrautārthaḥ śrautārthānumitaḥ dvividhaḥ sa vedārtha eva bhaviṣyatīti kiṃ vacanasopānāntarakalpanayā tena śrūyamāṇavedavacanapratipādyārthasāmarthyalabhyatvād eva tasya vedārthatā bhaviṣyati /	The Mimāṁsakas may contend that the Vedic text is of two-fold character. viz., the first type is heard, i. e., given and the second one is inferred and that what is presumed also pertains to the Vedic text. The counter argument of the Naiyāyikas is as follows:- The subject-matter of the Vedic text admits of two kinds, viz., the first one is directly given by the Vedic texts and the second one is suggested by the first one.
sarvathā na vacanaikadeśaviṣayā śrutārthāpattiḥ śreyasī / śrutyekadeśakalpanāpakṣapratikṣepāc ca //	There are few examples of Vedic injunctions in which the verb 'to sacrifice' has been used but the agent i.e., the nominative has not been mentioned.
tad atīndriyatayā sambandhagrahaṇam aghaṭamānam iti yad uktaṃ tad api pratyuktam arthe tu sāmānyena sambandhagrahaṇam api sūpapādam / tatra tatra yajyāder arthasyādhikārādyarthāntarasambaddhasya dṛṣṭatvād iti //	But in these cases the nature of the agent can be easily guessed. The verb 'to sacri- fice' is transitive. Being such it produces some result. One who enjoys the fruit of the action is the agent since the relation of invariable concomitance holds between the enjoyer of the fruit of an action and the transitive verb like the verb 'to sacrifice'.
prabhākarās tu [dṛṣṭaḥ śruto vā] iti bhāṣyaṃ [laukikam abhidhānāntaram evedam upalabdhivacanam] iti varṇayantaḥ śrutārthāpattiṃ pratyācakṣate / śrūyamāṇasyaiva śabdasya tāvaty arthe sāmarthyam upagacchantaḥ tam arthaṃ śābdam eva pratijānate /	It is only a popular saying. But the real meaning of it is that the complete Vedic sentence gives rise to such knowledge of objects as removes the apparent inconsistency involved in it (the Vedic sentence). Thus Prabhākara and his followers refuse to accept Śruta-arthāpatti (presumption based upon the verbal testimon as one of the distinct varieties of Presumption and propound the thesis that the additional meaning which the words of the Vedic sentence do not cover is also conveyed by this sentence and the above knowledge is thus derived from the source of verbal testimony.
vākyasya dūrāvidūravyavasthitaguṇāguṇakriyādyanekakārakakalāpoparaktakāryātmakavākyārthapratītau iṣor iva dīrghadīrgho vyāpāraḥ /	As an arrow has a short or long process, i.e., it hits a near or a remote object orit pierces and passes through a thin or thick object quickly or slowly, so a sentence quickly or slowly94 conveys its meaning since the knowledge of the complete mean- ing depends upon a group of factors viz. the knowledge of the meanings of words denoting qualities, substances, action, etc.
aviratavyāpāre ca śabde sā pratītir udeti tadvyāpāraviratau nodeti /	As long as the function of words conveying their meanings continues so long the knowledge of the meaning arises in our mind.
tadutpādakakārakābhāvāt /	But when its function ceases to work it produces no knowledge since the factors which determine knowledge do not exist.

tadanuvartīni tu padāni tasmin naimittike nimittāni bhavanti //	The words which constitute these sentences determine the meanings of them which obey a number of speci- fic conditions.
naimittikānukūlyaparyālocanayā kvacid aśrūyamāṇāny api tāni nimittatām bhajante viśvajidādau svargakāmādipadavat //	There are a few Vedic injunc- tions which are elliptical in their character. An illustration of this type is 'Viśvajita yajeta' a person who intends to enjoy heavenly bliss should perform the sacrifice called Viśvajit which is a means to this end.
kvacit śrūyamāṇāny api tadananukūlatvāt parityajyante [yasyobhayaṃ havir ārtim ārcchet] itivat //	There are also some other injunctions in which the given words which are heard are given up since they do not help to convey the complete meanings of them (injunctions).
kvacid anyathāsthitāni tadanurodhād anyathaiva sthāpyante [prayājaśeṣeṇa havīṃṣy abhighārayati] itivat //	Such a provision invites other considerations. There should be also some ruling with regard to the preserv- ations of such clarified butter and the provision of a pot which will contain it.

If the truth of the above judgment is accepted then it also stands to reason that a sentence, a portion of which is not given may also directly convey a meaning.

As in the so-called instances of presumption based upon the verbal testimony the meaning is directly conveyed by the incomplete Vedic sentences so the intermediate process of supplying the silent portion in order to render the sentence complete is superfluous.
evam aśruteṣv api bhaviṣyati /	Now, a problem arises in our mind.
na yajau karaṇavibhaktiṃ śṛṇumaḥ na svarge karmavibhaktim nāgnacidādiṣu kvippratyayam nādhunādiṣu prakṛtim na samāsataddhiteṣu yathocitāṃ vibhaktim api ca pratīma eva tadartham //	When we get the word thus formed, there is no trace of the kvip suffix which is dropp- ed in the resultant form. But the meaning of the unheard suffix is definitely grasped. The word 'adhuna' also contains an element which is not heard. The combination of the pronoun 'idam' with the nominal suffix adhuna results in the word 'adhuna' (at present).
evaṃ viśvajidādāv api [yajeta] iti naimittikabalād eva svargakāmādipadārthaṃ pratyeṣyāmaḥ /	Similarly, we follow the meaning of the incomplete sentence 'Viśvajitā yajeta'. In the light of its meaning we come to learn that it contains the word 'svarga-kamaḥ' which remains unheard.
niyogagarbhatvāc ca viniyogasya liṅgādīni śrutikalpanām antareṇāpi niyogavyāpāraṃ parigṛhya tena vastuni viniyojakatāṃ pratipatsyante //	The Mīmāṁsakas of the Prabhakara school contend that a viniyoga injunction discharges its function of pointing to the relation between the end and the means with the help of five proofs with Linga at the top and Samakhya at the bottom.
nanv evaṃ sati sarvatra śabdavyāpārasaṃbhavāt /	Thus, no Sruti should be presumed in the absence of a direct Śruti.
śrutiliṅgādimānānāṃ virodhe yac ca varṇyate /	In fine, there is no scope for Śruta-arthāpatti in connection with the function of viniyoga injunction.
pūrvapūrvabalīyas tvaṃ tat kathaṃ vā bhaviṣyati // ucyate saty api sarvatra śabdavyāpāre tatprakārabhedopapatter eṣa na doṣaḥ /	Now how can they do justice to such example if they do not subscribe to the view of the Bhāṭṭas ? The Prābhākaras face this objection thus:-The words which constitute a sentence and determine its meaning have got a part to play.
na hi padānāṃ sarvātmanā nimittabhāvam apahāyaiva naimittikapratītir upaplavate / tadaparityāgāc ca tatsvarūpavaicitryam anuvartata eva //	But the mean- ing of a sentence cannot suddenly appear if its essential elements denote no meaning. Again, if it is admitted that the constituent words have their contribution towards the mean- ing of a sentence then it goes without saying that the words will be admitted to denote the different types of meaning (primary, secondary, etc.).
anyathā siṃhaśabdena matiḥ kesariṇīsute / anyathā devadattādau pratītir upajanyate //	The word 'lion' has a primary meaning in some sentences. But the very word, used in the sentences like the present one 'Devadatta is a lion' denotes a secondary meaning.
gaṅgāyāṃ majjatīty atra gaṅgāśabdo nimittatām /	98 The word 'Ganges' has a primary meaning in the sentence 'He takes his ablution in the Ganges' (Gañgâyāṁ Majjati).
upayāti yathā naivaṃ ghoṣādivasatau tathā //	The first proof gets the first preference since it conveys the above relation without the least delay.

The very power of conveying such relation, being the same, how can one proof prevail upon another, preventing the due function of the so-called dependant proof in question? To meet this objection, they will have to revise their assumption and hold that the proofs do not uniformly impart the above power to the injunction in question.
atha tatkalpane teṣāṃ vidūrāntikavṛttitā /	Similarly, all the proofs have not the same speed to convey the above relation promptly.
sa evārthagato nyāya iti tatkalpanena kim //	Therefore, the assumption of the power of words or that of a sentence is of no use.
aindrāgnādiṣu vaikṛteṣu karmasu na prākṛtavidhyantavacanānumānam api tu codakavyāpāreṇa tasyaiva prāptiḥ /	In case of Vikṛta rites no injunction which throws light on the observance of their subsidiary rites is found. But still none should infer an in- junction which provides us with the required details.

But there is a difference in the matter of the perfor- mance of the two sets of rites according to the direct and the indirect mandates.
nanu yathākāryam upadeśe 'nupayujyamānakṛṣṇalacarvavaghātādeḥ prāptir eva na bhaved iti ko bādhārthaḥ na akhaṇḍamaṇḍalavidhyantakāṇḍaprāpteḥ /	But in case of the performance of a subsidiary rite the details are not directly supplied by an injunction. They follow from the injunc- tion which governs the basic principal rite. All the details of the main rite are not to be necessarily performed in connection with the observance of a secondary rite.
na hy aśāṃśikayā codakaḥ pravartata ity alam anayā prasaktānuprasaktyāgataśāstrāntaragarbhakathāvistaraprastāvanayā //	Moreover, in connection with the perform- ance of a principal rite some such details are observed as are not directly mentioned by injunctions. They are not to be counted upon as essential for Vikṛta karman.

vidher niṣedhāvagatir vidhibuddhir nisedhataḥ /	They say that a positive sentence suggests a negative meaning and that a negative sentence suggests a positive meaning.
yathā bhava dhammiya vīsattho mā sma pāntha gṛhaṃ viśa //	The negative sentence "Oh traveller ! do not enter this house etc." suggests a positive meaning.

athavā nedṛśī carcā kavibhiḥ saha śobhate / vidvāṃso 'pi vimuhyanti vākyārthagahane 'dhvani //	Or, one should not engage one self in dissertation with the students of pure literature since the learned scholars in the different branches of study become perplexed to ascertain the much complicated meaning of a sentence.

Hence, we shall now return to our old topic.
āha abhāvas tarhi pramāṇāntaram astu satparicchedakaṃ yatra na pramāṇaṃ pravartate /	Our confirmed opinion on this topic is this that presumption does not differ in the slightest degree from inference.
tadabhāvamitau mānaṃ pramāṇābhāva ucyate //	The proof which does not reveal a positive object reveals a neg- ative object and is called the privation of proof (pramāṇābhāva).
iha ghaṭo nāstīti ghaṭaṃ prati sadupalambhakapramāṇapravṛttir nāstīti asau pramāṇābhāvaḥ ghaṭābhāvaṃ paricchinatti //	If we analyse the judgment that there is no jar here then we find that a proof which grasps only a positive object reveals a jar and that a negative judgement that there is no jar owes its exis- tence to the privation of all proofs.
tatra ca ghaṭaviṣayajñātṛvyāpārānutpāda eva dṛśyādarśanavācyaḥ pramāṇaṃ nāstīti buddhiḥ phalam //	If we dive deep into the matter then we see that the non-appearance of the knowing process of the knower directed to a jar is the proof which is called the non-perception of a perceptible object and the result- ing consciousness assumes the form that a jar does not exist. (This hypothesis is not sound since the proof in question is not a form of consciousness).

The judgment that there is no jar is the proof. The result of such a proof is that the negation of a jar is to be avoid- ed or obtained etc.

tatra tāvad idaṃ nāstīti jñānaṃ na pratyakṣajanitam indriyārthasannikarṣābhāvāt /	The judgement that there is no jar here is not perceptual since it does not owe its existence to the sense-object contact.

They arise from the combination of these two contacts such as conjunction-cum-in- herence etc. Such a contact is not possible here. The state of being an adjective to an object, conjoined to a sense-organ, does not constitute the sense-object-contact in this particular case.
na hy asaṃyuktam asamavetaṃ vā kiñcid viśeṣaṇaṃ bhavati /	What qualifies another object must be either in conjunction with it or inhere in it.
saṃyuktasya daṇḍādeḥ samavetasya śuklaguṇādeḥ tathābhāvadarśanāt /	The colour 'white' which inheres in an object qualifies it. This is the nature of an adjec- tive which we learn from experience.
abhāvaś ca na kenacit saṃyujyate adravyabhāvāt / na kvacit samavaiti guṇādivailakṣaṇyād iti //	The negation of an object is not conjoined to an object, its container, since it is neither a quality nor an action nor a universal.

ayogyatvān na gṛhṇātīti cet tadabhāvam api mā grahīt ayogyatvāviśeṣāt /	The Naiyāyikas may meet this objection with the remark that taste is not visualised since it is not capable of being visualised.

The capability of being perceived should alone determine percep- tion.

How can the proposed difference in the knowledge of negation be accounted for? The Mimamsakas boldly meet this objection and emphatically say, "Oh, yes there exists a difference between the perception of a spot and the awareness of negation.
na hy asannikṛṣṭaṃ cakṣuravagatijanmane prabhavati //	The negation of an object is not perceiv- ed because no sense-organ has contact with it." If the eyes do not come in contact with the perceptible object then the perception of the object does not arise.

Our eyes are not the unconditional antecedent to the knowledge of heat. Simi- larly, eyes are not the indispensable condition of the awareness of the negation of a jar which is not invariably connected with the visual perception of the spot. Hence, the awareness of the negation of a jar is not perceptual.
tad uktam [gṛhītvā vastusadbhāvaṃ smṛtvā ca pratiyoginam /	It has been stated thus : (in Kumårila's Šlokavārttika) The knower at the outset perceives the locus of negation. Then he recollects the object negated.
mānasaṃ nāstitājñānaṃ jāyate 'kṣānapekṣayā] iti // ataś caiva asannihitasyāpi kvacid grahaṇam /	(Thus, the awareness of negation is never perceptual since it does not directly owe its existence to the sense-stimulus), For the reason stated above, we have, sometimes, the know- ledge of the negation of an object-the negation which lies out- side the range of our sense-organs. Let us cite an example.
svarūpamātrakeṇa gauramūlakam upalabdhavataḥ tato deśāntaraṃ gatasya tatra kenacit gargo 'sti vā nāsti vā itipṛṣṭasya sata svarūpamātraṃ gṛhītam / gauramūlakam anusmarataḥ tadānīm asannikṛṣṭe 'pi gargasya bhāve tadaiva tasya jñānam udeti /	A man who has thoroughly seen all the objects of Gauramūlaka, a village, has gone out of the village to a distant place. ThereRefutation of Dhvani he has been asked by a person whether Garga lives at Gauramū- laka or not. Now he who thoroughly knows Gauramülaka re- collects for sometime and knowledge dawns in his mind that Garga is not present at Gauramülaka which lies outside the range of his sense-organs.
tatra indriyakathāpi nāstīti na tasya pratyakṣatvam /	Sense-organs play no part to produce this negative judgment. Hence, the awareness of negation is not perceptual.
na cānumānagamyo 'yam abhāvaḥ bhūpradeśasya tadgataghaṭādarśanasya vā liṅgatvānupapatteḥ /	Neither the locus of negation, i.e., the particular space in Gauramülaka nor the non-perception of the object negated is the required mark necessary for an inference.

Moreover, a reliable mark rests upon the subject of inference without an exception.
nāpi ghaṭādarśanaṃ liṅgam apakṣadharmatvāt /	Moreover, the negation of an object does not belong to a parti- cular spot.
ghaṭādarśanaṃ ghaṭasya dharmaḥ na tadabhāvasya /	The non-perception of a jar may somehow belong to a jar but does not belong to the spot which contains the negation of a jar.
ghaṭābhāvapratītiṃ prati vyāpriyamāṇatvāt taddharmatvam asyeti cet na itaretarāśrayaprasaṅgāt /	It may be urged that as non-perception of a jar contributes its quota towards the appearance of the aware- ness of the negation of a jar so it belongs to the spot.
taddharmatve sati liṅgapratītijanakatvaṃ pratītijanmani sato taddharmatvam iti /	Such an argument involves the fallacy of mutual dependence. The fallacy may be thus illustrated.
asiddhāyāṃ ca ghaṭābhāvapratītau taddharmatājñānam adarśanasya durghaṭam eva /	If the non-perception of a jar belongs to the spot, the subject of inference, the mark, i,c., the non- 105Nyayamanjari perception in question, becomes strong enough to produce the required inferential knowledge of the probandum in question.
siddhāyāṃ tu kiṃ pakṣadharmatājñānena sādhyapratīteḥ siddhatvāt //	Again, if the inferential knowledge of the probandum correctly arises from the premises then the mark is known to belong truly to the subject of inference.

The discovery of invariable concomitance depends upon the previous knowledge of both the mark and the probandum as it has been found in the case of smoke and fire.
tata evānumānād iti yady ucyate tad itaretarāśrayam /	The mark, viz., non-perception is itself a negative fact.

adarśanākhyaṃ liṅgam api darśanābhāvasvabhāvam iti tatsvarūpaparicchedacintāyām apy ayam eva panthāḥ /	(To infer a negative fact we require a mark which is also a negative fact. The mark, being a negative fact, is to be inferred. Another negative mark is thus.
ato dūram api gatvā tadavagamasiddhaye pramāṇāntaram abhāvaparicchedanipuṇam avagantavyam iti tata eva tadavagamasiddher na tasyānumeyatvam //	It also cannot but be inferred by means of some other negative fact which is a mark, and so on ad infinitum. Thus, the fallacy of a regressus ad infinitum cannot be avoided.) Hence, we cannot count upon an inference as revealing negation.

Therefore, it stands to reason that the knowledge of a negative fact is due to a proof which is itself negative in its character since all the positive proofs exclusively throw light on the positive objects.
api ca prameyaṃ anurūpeṇa pramāṇena pramātumucitam bhāvātmike prameye hi nābhāvasya pramāṇatā / abhāve 'pi prameye syāt na bhāvasya pramāṇatā //	A proof and an object which is known by it should be alike in their character (similiasimilibus etc.). A proof which is negative in its character cannot reveal a positive object. Simi- larly, a negative fact cannot be established by a proof which is positive in its character.
na prameyam abhāvākhyaṃ nihnutaṃ bauddhavat tvayā /	A proof which throws light only on a negative fact cannot be gainsaid.
pramāṇam api tenedaṃ abhāvātmakam iṣyatām //	Therefore, a proof which is negative in its character should be admitted in order to enlighten a negative fact.
atrābhidhīyate satyam abhāvaḥ prameyam abhyupagamyate pratyakṣādyavasīyamānasvarūpatvāt tu na pramāṇāntaram ātmaparicchittaye mṛgayate /	It is a truism that a negative fact is admitted by the Mimāṁsakas of the Bhaṭṭa school to be objectively real and distinct. One should not search for a distinct proof for its illu- mination since it is revealed by perception and similar other proofs already admitted by us.
adūramedinīdeśavartinas tasya cakṣuṣā /	When a negative fact rests upon a spot which is within the field of our vision it is seen with our own eyes.
paricchedaḥ parokṣasya kvacin mānāntarair api //	But when it lies beyond the range of our sense-organ it is grasped by any other competent proof.
tathā ca [iha ghaṭo nāsti] iti jñānam ekam evedam [iha kuṇḍe dadhi] iti jñānavat ubhayālambanam anuparatanayanavyāpārasya bhavati /	Similarly, the judg- ment that there is no jar here is a simple one. In the first case, both the objects, viz., curd and the pot stimulate eyes which produce the first judgment. Similarly, in the second case, the negation of a jar and the spot stimulate eyes which without be- ing passive and functionless produce the second judgment.
tatra bhūpradeśamātra eva nayanajaṃ jñānam itaratra pramāṇāntarajanitam iti kutastyo 'yaṃ vibhāgaḥ atrāgnir iti yukto 'yaṃ anakṣajaḥ pratibhāsaḥ /	Now, how can the Mimamsakas hold that the negative judgement is a complicated one? They hold that the one element of it the spot is visualised whereas the other element of it is grasped by some-other proof. How can a distinction in the nature of the so-called awareness of the two objects be logically drawn? The judgment that the hill is fiery is a simple one but still it is a judgment by complication.
dhūmagrahaṇāntaraṃ avinābhāvasmaraṇādibuddhyantaravyavadhānasaṃbhavāt /	If we take the growth of knowledge of fire into consideration then we find that the remembrance of the invariable concomitance obtaining between smoke and fire and such other thought processes intervene between the perception of smoke and the appearance of the knowledge of fire.
iha tu tathā nāsty eva /	But in case of the above negative judgment there is no such delay.
avyavahitaiva hi bhūpradeśavat ghaṭanāstitā 'vagatir avicchedenānubhūyate /	Like the perception of the spot the awareness of the negation of a jar immediately and invariably follows the sense-object-contact, i.e., the functioning of the sense-organ, viz., the eyes.

The awareness of negation is causally connected with the senses. Its causal connection is based upon the joint method of agreement and difference.

The negative awareness is visual since it is produced when the eyes do not cease to function. Such an awareness closely follows the sense stimulus. The Mimãmsakas have pointed out that the colour of a distant fire is seen but its heat is in- ferred and that the knowledge of heat is not causally con- nected with the sense-stimulus.
tatra hi bahuśaḥ sparśadarśanakauśalaśūnyatvam avadhāritaṃ cakṣuṣaḥ sparśaparicchedi ca kāraṇāntaraṃ tvagindriyam avagatam //	But this analogical argument does not hold good. The conclusion that no eyes are capable of feeling heat has been repeatedly arrived at.

Thus, in the above case, heat is only inferred since eyes are absolutely incapable of feeling heat.
prakṛte tu nedṛśaḥ prakāraḥ samasti /	The conclusion, reached by the Mimāṁsakas, is one-sided.
na caikatra tadbhāvabhāvitvam anyathāsiddham iti sarvatra tathā kalpyate /	It is not applicable to the perception of negation. If the awareness of an object which follows the visual percep- tion of its container is not of sensuous origin then it does not follow that every such awareness as follows perception is non-Refutation of Non-perception 109 perceptual.

An object is known as visualized when it is an actual object of perception produced by eyes.

The sky though connected with eyes is not visualized. Now, if the Naiyáyikas go to the other extreme and hold that an object which is not connected with eyes is also visualized then the very distant and the past objects such as Vibhiṣaṇa and others should have been visualized.

Whenever a positive object which is connected with the sense- organ is perceived, the sense-object contact is one of the six types mentioned in the Nyaya text book.

Now, if we stick to this conclusion then we smell a scent of possible ano- maly that if a negative fact which does not come in contact with the sense-organ is perceived then all negative facts belong- ing to distant lands should also be perceived since they are also in no way connected with the sense-organ. Such an anomaly does not arise since the awareness of a negative fact is deter- mined by the perception of its locus.

We shall prove on the score of expe- rience that there exists a third type of relation which is other than the relation of conjunction and that of inherence and is called the relation of the qualifying to the qualified.

Now, the opponents may contend that if such a relation suffers from defects then it should not be admitted and that its non-admission does not affect our posi- tion.

Now, if this is all what the opponents have got to say then negation should also be perceived since the sense-organ functions or there exists mutual fitness, the prerequisite conditions of perception.
tasmāt ṣaṭprakārā sannikarṣānugāminī yogyatā vaktavyā na yogyatāmātra eva viśramya sthātavyam /	For the reason stated above, it should be admitted that there are six kinds of fitness and that they correspond to the six-fold sense-object-contact. The mere statement of non specified fitness will not do.
yatra yogyatā tatra sannikarṣo 'py asti na tu yatra sannikarṣaḥ tatrāvaśyaṃ yogyatety evam abhyupagacchatāṃ na rasādyatiprasaṅgacodanā dhunoti manaḥ /	Thus taste is never introspected though it comes in con- tact with the inner organ (manas) since the inner-organ is neither capable of introspecting it nor taste is capable of being introspected.

Now, a doubt whether Garga is now there or not lingers in his mind since Garga may go back to that village from some other place and stay there.

This objection is not sound.

Moreover, the statement of Kumärila himself that the locus to this that -the village-has been only perceived amounts the negations of all other objects are also perceived along with the locus but this perception is not introspected since the term 'only' signifies the negations of objects other than the locus.
evaṃ hi bhavān evābhyadhāt [ayam eveti yo hy eṣa bhāve bhavati nirṇayaḥ / naiṣa vastvantarābhāvasaṃvittyanugamād ṛte] iti //	When we determine a positive object and express our determination in the form that this is so and nothing else such determination necessarily involves a reference to the negation of other objects.

Hence, the hypothesis that the awareness of114 negation is indirect should be given up. It should also be admitted that the negation of an object is perceived.
yat punar ananumeyatvaṃ [iha ghaṭo nāsti] iti prakṛtābhāvaviṣayam abhyadhāyi tat asmākam abhimatam eva /	The negation of an object which lies outside the field of vision is also inferred. An instance of the inference of negation is as follows.

Another example is being cited to bring home on the above point. This example is the familiar example cited by the Mimamsakas to illustrate presumption. It is as follows.
āgamād apy abhāvasya kvacid bhavati niścayaḥ /	The negation of an object is also known on the strength of verbal testimony.
corādināstitājñānaṃ adhvagānām ivāptataḥ //	The travellers, having heard the words of trustworthy persons, ascertained that there was no thief, etc.

They show that a positive object is grasped only by means of a positive means of proof. Such an argument is not convincing.
abhāvaḥ paṭalādīnāṃ pratyakṣasya prapadyate / vipakṣavṛttyabhāvaś ca liṅgasya sahakāritām //	The absence of eye-disease is one of the conditions of perception. The absence of the probans on the locus of the negation of the probandum is one of the concomitant condi- tions which accompanies the probans to generate inferential knowledge.
puruṣoktiṣu doṣāṇām abhāvaś copayujyate /	The absence of defects of a speaker such as absence of negligence, untruthfulness, etc.

abhāvaś ca kvacil liṅgam iṣyate bhāvasaṃvidaḥ / vṛṣṭyabhāvo 'pi vāyvabhrasaṃyogasyānumāpakaḥ //	Sometimes, a negative fact constitutes a probans which leads to the inferential knowledge of a positive probandum. The absence of rainfall leads to the inference of the blowing away of the cloud by the storm (the contact of the cloud with the storm).
tasmād yuktam abhāvasya nābhāvenaiva vedanam /	Thus, it is unreasonable to hold that a negative fact is known only by means of a negative means of proof.

A negative judgment is ex- pressed in the form that this is not here now. Though negation is cognized as indicated above yet it should be actually related to the three relata, viz., time, space and the object negated.

nanu viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāva eva sambandhaḥ kiṃ sambandhāntarāpekṣayā maivam sambandhāntaramūlakatvena tadavagamāt /	But such a contention is not tena- ble since the relation of the qualifying to the qualified pre- supposes some other basic relation obtaining between them (the qualifier and the qualified). A term which qualifies an- other term as an adjective is either conjoined to or inheres in that term.
saṃyuktaṃ samavetaṃvā viśeṣaṇaṃ bhavati daṇḍī devadattaḥ nīlam utpalam iti /	They are as follows: Devadatta is possessed of a stick. This lotus is bluc. (In the first instance a stick which becomes a predicate of Devadatta is at first conjoined to him.
ataś ca na vāstavaḥ svatantra eva viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāvaḥ sambandhaḥ //	In the second instance the colour 'blue' at the outset inheres in the lotus and then be- comes a predicate.) Hence, the relation of the qualifying to the qualified is really not an independent relation.
puruṣecchayā viparyasyantam apy enaṃ paśyāmaḥ /	By the sweet will of a person the conversion of the terms of the rela-116 Nyāyamanjari tion of the qualifying to the qualified is noticed.

Therefore, this relation is not objectively real but imaginary. No relation can specially exist between negation and the object negated since there is neither co-existence nor coordination between negation and the object negated.
yadā hi ghaṭaḥ na tadā tadabhāvaḥ yadā vā tadabhāvaḥ na tadā ghaṭa iti //	Suppose, a jar is present in a particular spot at a particular point of time. It cannot be absent from that spot at that point of time.

The Naiyāyikas may contend that the relation of opposition holds between negation and the object negated. Now, let us see what is meant by opposition.
abhyupagame vā ghaṭatadabhāvayoḥ ghaṭamudgarayor iva vadhyaghātukayoḥ sāhacaryam anubhūyeta /	If the negation of a jar is a pre- established real fact, comes to the locus of a jar and opposes it then it will be opposed to it like a mace opposing a jar.
abhāvāntarakaraṇe tv anavasthā /	Such a relation of opposition does not exist between them.
mudgarādayo ghaṭābhāvasya hetavo na bhavitum arhanti bhāvasya svata eva bhaṅguratvena vināśahetvanapekṣatvāt //	The so-called sources of the des- truction of a jar do not bring about its destruction since a posi- tive object, being destructible by its own nature, does not require a destroyer for its destruction.
bhāvo vinaśvarātmā cet kṛtaṃ pralayahetubhiḥ /	If a positive object is destructible by its own nature then there is no need of postulating a condition of its destruction.
arthāpy anaśvarātmā cet kṛtaṃ pralayahetubhiḥ //	If it is indestructible by its own nature then the so-called condi- tions of its destruction have got no part to play.
tasmād vijātīyakapālādisantatijanana eva mudgarādikārakavyāpāraḥ sāmagryantarānupraveśe sati santatyanarotpādaḥ na punar abhāvasya tato niṣpattiḥ /	For this reason, due to the operation of conditions like a mace, etc., a series of heterogeneous effects such as pot-sherds, etc., comes into being out of a jar, etc. Again if these pheno- mena are brought under some other series then a new series of effects will appear.
sa hi ghaṭāt vastvantaraṃ cet kim āyātam yad asau na pūrvavad upalabhyate /	But it may be contended that the above negative fact (the post-negation of a jar) is something real and happens to be other than a jar.

anarthāntaratve tu ghaṭasyaiva mudgarakāryatvaṃ syāt / nanu yāni mudgareṇa kapālāni janyante sa eva ghaṭābhāvaḥ /	Again, if the negation of a jar is not different from a jar then a jar should have been an effect of a mace. Now, the Buddhists may argue that the pot-sherds which are produced by a mace constitute the very negation of a jar.
hanta tarhi kapālāsphoṭane sati ghaṭābhāvasya vinaṣṭatvāt ghaṭasyonmajjanaṃ prāpnoti //	If these potsherds are crushed then the negation of a jar is virtually destroyed. In that case, the destroyed jar will re-appear.
kiñca akiñcitkarāṇi kapālāni ghaṭasyābhāva iti yady ucyate paṭasyāpi tathocyeran /	Now, the Buddhists may revise their hypothesis and hold that the potsherds which produce no effects are called the negation of a jar.
api cāyam abhāvo bhavanadharmā vā syāt abhavanadharmā vā bhavanadharmatve bhāvo 'sau bhavet ghaṭādivat /	In that case, the potsherds may be the negation of a cloth as well because an unreal object cannot be distinguished from another such unreal object.
abhavanadharmā tu yady abhāvo 'sti sa nitya evāsau tarhi bhavet //	If it does not come into being but enjoys existence then it should be eternal.
sa cāyam ekapadārthasambandhī vā syāt sarvapadārthasambandhī vā tatra ekabhāvasambandhitve na tasya nityam akāraṇam utpaśyāmaḥ /	If it is eternal then is it related only to a particular object or to all ? Of these two alternatives we find no reason in favour of the first one.
sarvabhāvasambandhitve tu sarvapadārthapratikūlasyābhāvasya nityatvāt nityasannihitatvāt sakṛd eva trailokyalopaprasaṅgaḥ /	If the second alternative is accepted then the parti- cular negation, being eternal and all-pervasive, should oppose each and every positive object by its very nature.
tasmāt na nityo 'nityo vā kaścid abhāvo nāmāsti //	The net result of this opposition is that all positive objects, eternal or non- eternal, would have surely ceased to exist.
nanu abhāvānabhyupagame bhāvānām itaretarasaṅkarāt akhilavyavahāraviplavaḥ prāpnoti /	If negation does not enjoy objective reality, milk will be identical with sour milk and sour milk will be so with milk.

abhāvāntarajanyā cet anavasthā duruttarā //	Negation has its own innate character, viz., negativity.

pratiṣedhyāś ca bhāvāḥ paraspareṇa bhidyamānas taṃ bhindantīti praty uta bhāvādhīnam abhāvānām asāṅkaryaṃ vaktum ucitam na tu viparyayo yuktaḥ /	The objects which are negated by negation are positive. As they differ from one another so their corresponding negations mutually differ. From the above finding of facts it is reasonable to hold that the positive objects consti- tute the mark of distinction of the negative individuals but not the reverse.
tat akhilapadārthavyavasthāvisaṃṣṭhulībhāvabhayād api nābhāvābhyupagamo yuktaḥ //	Hence, it will be unwise to assume the hypothesis of a nega- tive real since the apprehension of colossal chaos arising from it haunts us.
nanv abhāvapratikṣepe nañaḥ kiṃ vācyaṃ ucyatām / naiva śabdānusāreṇa vācyasthitir upeyate //	If negation has no objective existence then what is the mean- ing of the negative particle 'mà'? There is no truth behind the hypothesis that every word has a real meaning.

When a negative particle is connected with a verb these two being together suggest to our mind an idea of the mere cessation of the action denoted by the verb.
nanu cānena mārgeṇa yady abhāvo nirasyate / ekādaśaprakāraiṣā 'nupalabdhiḥ kva gacchatu //	Now, a question is put to the Buddhists that if the Buddhists discard the hypothesis of negation then what purpose will be served by the elevenfold division of non-perception the only source of the awareness of negation ? Eleven-fold division of Non-perception 1.

Such non- dependence on the invariable mark of certainty is contradic- torily opposed to uncertainty.

How can non-perception be the probans in this case? The Buddhists say in reply that there is much truth in this question, but the contender misses the inner significanceDivision of Non-perception 121 of the Buddhist theory. Non-perception does not actually lead on to the actual negative proposition but to the potentiality of doing so.

How is it that they are identical? The Buddhists give a reply to this question in the following manner. Those who know the real character of non-perception explain it thus. Non-perception is not a negative fact. It is not contradictorily -opposed to perception.

This potentiality is not different from non-percep- tion. Hence non-perception is such a probans as is non- different from the probandum to be established.
piśācetararūpo hi caitraḥ pratyakṣagocaraḥ /	Potentiality, mentioned above, is a positive state but non-perception is a negative fact.

Is it identical with the surface of the spot or not? If it is identical then the spot, containing a jar, should also be referred to by the negative judgment that there is no jar on this spot since the surface of the spot remains the same whether it contains a jar or not.

The judg- ment in question is that a jar does not exist here. The Budd- hists hold that it refers to a spot devoid of a jar. The Naiyāyikas point out that the term 'heie' which is one of constituents of the above judgment refers to a spot.

The Buddhists hold that a negative judg- ment follows an indeterminate perception in quick succession like a determinate perception and they should admit that the negative judgment must share the same fate with the positive one.
pratiṣedhavikalpas tu na vidhyanubhavocitaḥ // nanu naiva vikalpānāṃ vayaṃ prāmāṇyavādinaḥ /	But a negative judgment should not be based upon sense-perception. The Naiyāyikas124 —— contend that no judgments which are constructed by imagina- tion are true.

vastuprāptyā vidhivikalpānāṃ pramāṇavyavahāra iti cet ihāpi tatprāptyaiva niṣedhavikalpānām astu prāmāṇyavyavahāraḥ /	Now, the Buddhists may contend that the positive judgments are called as true because they are conducive to the attainment of a real object. If this is the purport of their contention then it may be pointed out that the negative ones are also true since they likewise lead to a real object.
kim atra vastu prāpyata iti cet tatrāpi kiṃ prāpyate nīlam iti cet seyam abhāvasyāpi prāptir bhavaty eva /	What is the real object to be attained by means of a negative judgment? A counter-question is put to them. What is the real object to be acquired by a positive judgment ? They may answer that it is 'blue'.

As 'blue' with this characterization is obtained so it is not un- reasonable to hold that the negation of yellow, etc., is also obtained. If it is not admitted then the attainment of blue can- not also be explained since it is impossible to think of 'blue' without the above characterization.

This objection is not tenable. From the Buddhist position no real object which produces awareness is revealed by it since if it endures two or three points of time the doctrine of the universal flux falls down.

Moreover, oh fool! you are to explain why does 'colour' differ from 'taste' though they alike produce the same effect viz., consciousness ? If you hold that difference in the character of awareness accounts for diversity in the nature of their objects then the character of the positive and negative reals should also be essentially different though they are endowed with the same 125126 causal efficiency since they generate dissimilar awareness.

iti // tasmāt [asti] iti pratītir iva bhāvaḥ [nāsti] iti pratīter abhāvo bhūmir ity abhyupagamyatām //	Hence, they point to the existence of positive and negative reals. This is the corollary of the above finding. It should also be admitted by the Buddhists.
atha vā vijñānavāda eva suspaṣṭam āsthīyatām antarāvasthānaṃ tu na sāṃpratam /	But the Buddhists hold that negation is a mental construction. In that case, they should be thorough and consistent subjective Idealists. It is not proper for them to embrace half-hearted Idealism.

svajñānākhyakriyāśaktir amuṣya durapahnavā / arthakriyā 'nyajanyā tu na bhāvenāpi janyate //	A negative real produces at least its awareness. Hence, its power of production cannot be denied. But it is also a truism that a negative real cannot yield such result as a positive real does.
evaṃ ca sati yaḥ pūrvaṃ śaktivādo 'tra varṇitaḥ /	In this connection, it should be noted that a positive real fails to do what another such real does.

The possible relation of the qualifying to the qualified presupposes another relation as its basis. As the basic relation is impossible so the relation of the qualifying to the qualified cannot unite negation with its locus.
yad vā bhāve 'py eṣa na niyamaḥ /	The above law does not also apply to positive reals as well.

nāpy evam yat viśeṣaṇaṃ tat sambandham eveti samavāyasya saty api viśeṣaṇatve sambandhāntarābhāvāt /	There is also no such law as shows that whatever qualifies an object is related to it by another relation. The relation of inherence qualifies its relata but is not related to them by an ab-extra relation.

It presupposes no other relation to unite its relata.

tasmāt viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāva eva sambandho deśena bhūtalādinā sahābhāvasya //	Hence, negation is connected with its locus such as the spot, etc, by means of the relation of the qualifying to the qualified.

Similarly, the relation of the qualifying to the qualified holds between negation and its locus. But the only relation which subsists between negation and the object negated is that of opposition or incompatibility.
pratiyoginā tu saha virodho 'sya sambandhaḥ / ayam eva ca virodhārthaḥ yad ekatrobhayor asamāveśaḥ /	The rela- tion of opposition or incompatibility signifies that the two relata are incoordinate, i.e., they cannot simultaneously occupy the same locus.

Our experience bears convincing evidence to their mutual difference.
bhavanadharmatvaṃ cāsya hetvanvayavyatirekitvāt bhavati /	The causal relation which holds between the condition of negation and negation is established by the joint method of agreement and difference.
ghaṭo hi mṛtpiṇḍadaṇḍādīn iva janmani vināśe 'pi mudgarādīn anuvartate hetūn //	The emergence and the destruction of a jar depend upon their respective condi- tions. A jar depends upon a lump of earth, a stick etc.

It may be further contended that a jar has the capacity for producing both the series of similar and dis similar objects.

atadutpādakatve 'pi na kiñcin mudgarādinā //	If it is beyond the power of a jar to produce such effects then the condition can offer no assistance to a jar to produce such effects.

nanv asyābhavanaṃ vṛttaṃ sa evārtho 'yam ucyate /	The rejoin- der is that this admission amounts to the acceptance of the thesis that negation is objectively real.
ghañā kim aparāddhaṃ vaḥ kiṃ vā 'py upakṛtaṃ lyuṭā //	Has the suffix 'ghan' committed any offence against you ? Has the suffix 'lyut' render- ed some service to you? The Buddhists admit that there is 'abhavana' of a jar but there is no ‘abhāva' of a jar.
nanu uktaṃ na tasya kiñcid bhavati na bhavaty eva kevalam iti tad ayuktam yad asau na bhavati sa evāsyābhāvaḥ //	Such a contention is not tenable. The statement that the transitory jar does not exist in the next moment signifies that the negation of a jar exists.
nanu sa na na tu tasyābhāvaḥ maivam sa netiśabdayor jñānayoś ca viṣayabhedāt /	The pronoun saḥ (ii) and the indeclinable 'na' (not) have two distinct meanings and produce two pieces of awareness of the two different objects.
sa iti jñānasya smaryamāṇo ghaṭādir viṣayaḥ neti tu jñānasya abhāvo bhūmir ity alam alīkavidagdhaviracitaviphalavakravacanavimardena //	The awareness which corresponds to the pronoun 'sah' has for its object 'the jar', recalled in memory. The awareness which corresponds to the indeclinable 'na' has for its object 'negation'.
tasmād ittham abhāvasya prameyatvopapādanāt /	Thus, the conclusion which follows from the previous discus- sions is that negation is a distinct type of knowable reality.

kāraṇānupalabdhyādeḥ bāḍham astv anumānatā / svabhāvānupalabdhis tu pratyakṣam iti sādhitam //	The Mīmāṁsakas hold that negation is objectively real and non-perception is a distinct proof. The non-perception of a cause, etc., may serve the purpose of a mark which leads to the inferential knowledge of negation.

The destruction of a positive object which is an effect is not uncertain because it does not depend upon a factor other than its condition for its destruction.

The implication of such statement is that perception and non-perception respectively constitute the criterion of the objective reality or that of the unreality of an object.
etac cāyuktam darśanādarśanābhyāṃ hi sadasattve niścīyete na tu darśanādarśane eva sadasattve // na cāpratītimātreṇa tadabhāvanibandhanāḥ /	Such a view is not tenable. The positive or the negative character of an object is respectively determined by its perception or non-perception. But its perception or non-perception does not respectively amount to its reality or unreality.

The Refutation of the hostile views of the Prabhakaras The Prabhakaras may contend that there exists a sharp dis- tinction between universal and conditional non-perception.
sarvadā 'nupalambho hi kurvan nāstitvaniścayam / viśiṣyate mṛdantaśthasalilānupalabdhitaḥ //	The non-perception of hidden water is conditional. The absolute non-perception leads to a negative proposition. The sky-flower is never perceived.

ataś ca yad ucyate anupalabdheḥ punaḥ anupalabdhir evānupalabdhir iti tadbhaṇitimātram /	The Prabhākaras hold that there is a temporary non-perception but its real non-perception consists of repeated non-perception.
khapuṣpādes tu saviśeṣaṇatayā 'nupalabdhyā 'bhāva eva niścīyate na tasyānupalabdhimātram //	By means of the specified non-perception, i.e., the non-perception of a visible object the negation of an object is determined. But it is not a fact that its non-perception is only determined.
aniṣyamāṇe cābhāve bhāvānāṃ pratiyogini / nityataiṣāṃ prasajyeta na hy ete kṣaṇikās tava //	If the Prabhakaras deny objective existence to negation then all the positive objects which are negated by their correspond- ing negations would be eternal since they do not subscribe to the hypothesis that they are transitory.
mudgarādeś ca kiṃ kāryaṃ kapālapaṭalīti cet / ghaṭas tarhy avinaṣṭatvāt svakāryaṃ na karoti kim //	What is the effect of a mace, etc., which acts upon a jar? If they give a reply to it that the effect in question is a series of pot-sherds then the jar should exist and discharge its function since it is not destroyed.

vikalpaviṣayāḥ śabdā yathā śauddhodaner gṛhe / gīyante bhavatā naivam iti nañvācyam ucyatām //	The Buddhists hold that the meanings of words are conceptual but are not real. But the Prabhākaras do not subscribe to this view. According to them the meaning of a word is real.
prasiddhiś ca parityaktā na cābhāvaḥ parākṛtaḥ / upekṣitaś ca bhāṣyārthaḥ ity aho nayanaipuṇam //	The Prabhākaras have discarded the time-honoured hypothesis that negation is objectively real. But some concession has been given to it since they cannot do without admitting it in some form.

sa ca dvividhaḥ prāgabhāvaḥ pradhvaṃsābhāvaś ceti /	The Classification of the Negation Negation admits of two types, viz., (1) Prāgabhāva (the negation of an object prior to its appearance-pre-negation), and Pradhvamsa abhāva (the destruction of the created object- post-negation).

Another sect of logicians holds that it is divided into six classes, viz., the above four kinds with the addition of the two more types, viz.
utpannasyātmahānaṃ tu pradhvaṃsa iti kathyate //	The cessation of the essence of an object which has come into being is designated as pradhvansa.

The above mentioned 'sambhava' (probability) is different from inferential knowledge. The probable knowledge of 'drona' on the basis of the knowledge of khārī is really a deduction which follows from an induction.

Who knows whether a Yakṣa lives on a banian tree or not? Has any person ever seen the exact features of the body of a Yakṣa? If the rumour is true then it is not different from verbal testimony since it is as good as a sound advice (upadeśa).

In nocturnal darkness a man with his eyes shut up knows whether the hand has its fingers contracted or extended. In order to establish his point he holds that this piece of know- ledge is not produced by the touch-organ since his touch- organ is not pervasive and does not belong to his hand. But on the other hand, he illustrates cases which establish that percep- ion and inference are the sources of true knowledge.

Is there any kind of knowledge which does not depend upon the four types of knowledge mentioned before? The Cārvākas have tried in vain to establish that the number of the sources of valid knowledge cannot be fixed up since they have failed to realise the nice shades of distinction existing among the four kinds of proof and their efficacy.

Now, the occasion of defining the species turns up. The author of Nyâya-sutra selects at the out-set, perception for definition since it constitutes the foundation of all other sources of valid knowledge, being mentioned first. His definition of perception is as follows:-Perception is such consciousness as arises from the contact of a sense-organ with an object, has not the name of an object as its object (i.e.
1.1.4 //] pratyakṣam iti lakṣyanirdeśaḥ itarallakṣaṇam /	The term 'perception' (pratyakṣa) signifies the object to be defined. The remaining terms of the sūtra constitute the definition of perception.
samānāsamānajātīyavyavacchedo lakṣaṇārthaḥ /	The aim of a definition is to distinguish it from similar forms of conscious- ness and dissimilar knowable objects.
samānajātīyaṃ pramāṇatayā 'numānādi vijātīyaṃ prameyādi tato vyavacchinnaṃ pratyakṣasya lakṣaṇam anena sūtreṇopapādyate //	The knowable objects are dissimilar since they are not subsumed under the same genus. Such an exact definition has been proposed by the above sütra (aphorism). A preliminary objection has been raised by some critics.
atra codayanti indriyārthasannikarṣotpannatvādiviśeṣaṇaiḥ svarūpaṃ vā viśeṣyate sāmagrī vā phalaṃ vā tatra svarūpaviśeṣaṇapakṣe yat evaṃsvarūpaṃ jñānaṃ tat pratyakṣam iti tatsvarūpasya viśeṣitatvāt phalaviśeṣaṇānupādānāc ca lakṣaṇam avyāptyativyāptibhyām upahataṃ syāt /	They put this question to the Naiyāyikas whether the adjectival clauses such as 'as arises from the contact of a sense-organ with an object' etc. apply to the means of knowledge itself or to the assemblage of conditions of perception or to the resultant consciousness attained by the source of knowledge viz., percep- tion. If the means of perceptual awareness is predicated by these clauses then the above sutra signifies that consciousness, thus qualified by these adjectives, is perception, the means of knowledge. Now, if perception, the means of knowledge, is only specified that the adjectives mentioned above do not qualify the resultant-consciousness then the above definition of per- ception should be both too wide and too narrow.
avyāptis tāvat atathāvidhasvarūpasya bodhasya indriyādeś ca nirmalaphalajanakatayā labdhapramāṇabhāvasyāpi prāmāṇyaṃ noktaṃ bhavet /	The cases of direct aware- ness which are really free from blemishes but are not qualified by the above adjectives cannot be recognized as perception. The sense-organ and other such inanimate conditions which produce true perceptual knowledge and rightly deserve the title of perception cannot be the means of knowledge since the above adjectives are not applicable to them.
ativyāptiś ca tathāvidhasvarūpasyāpi jñānasyākārakasya vā saṃskārakāriṇo vā smṛtiṃ janayato vā saṃśayam ādadhānasya vā viparyayam utpādayato vā pramāṇatvaṃ prāpnoti phalasyāviśeṣitatvāt //	Moreover, if an instance of direct awareness, qualified by the above adjectives, produces either an impression or recollection or a doubt or an illusion will be entitled to the designation of a means of know- ledge since the result to be produced by it has not been speci- fied.

Therefore, the hypothe- sis that the above adjectives qualify perception, the means of knowledge is not tenable.

If the above sūtra represents both the means of perception and the result produced by it then the very construction of the constituent words of the sūtra in- dicates that there should be perfect co-ordination between the means of knowledge and its result.
pratyakṣaṃ pramāṇam ucyate /	From the context it is evi- dent that the sūtra intends to define the means of direct aware- ness.

How can there be co-ordination between an instrument and its result? (Co-ordination implies the numerical iden- tity between an instrument and its result). For the reasons noted above the above three alternative hypotheses are not sound.

This charge will be avoided by the insertion of the word 'yataḥ' (whence).
yataḥ evaṃvidhaviśeṣaṇaviśiṣṭaṃ jñānākhyaṃ phalaṃ bhavati tat pratyakṣam iti sūtrārthaḥ /	The boiled down meaning of the above sutra amo- unts to this that perception, the means of direct awareness, is that which is the source of such consciousness as has been specified by the above mentioned adjectives.

By the mere insertion of the word 'yataḥ' every word of the sutra becomes significant and all the words which consti- tute the sutra convert it into an ideal definition of perception. Now, a question arises in our mind that in the original form of the sútra the terms 'pratyakṣa (perception) and jñana signify the same object but in the new form of it why are they (the two terms) not allowed to co-ordinate? What is the purport of inserting 'yatah' into the sutra? An answer to this question is as follows.

Let us substantiate our point. A man perceives an object, viz., a wood apple.
tataḥ smṛtyanantaraṃ parāmarśajñānam asyopajāyate [ayaṃ sa kapitthajātīyaḥ] iti /	Then he remembers that it is conducive to pleasure in the form that a similar object (an object belonging to its class) gave him plea- sure in the past.

How can we accept the hypothesis that a sense-perception plays the part of an instrumental cause to bring about the remote final judgment that the object of such sense-perception is worth having.

In this case, the collocation of its object, the particular sense-organ, their con- tact etc. is the means of the direct awareness of the object. This awareness is a mere result but not a means to a further valid knowledge. As it only begets memory so it is not a source of valid knowledge since memory is not a piece of valid knowledge.

The above memory-judgment is followed by another judgment that the object which is being perceived belongs to the class of wood- apples which are conducive to pleasure like the wood-apple perceived before. This judgment owes its origin to the operat- ion of the sense-organ assisted by the preceding memory-judgment This judgment is itself perceptual.

As we infer fire which remains beyond the reach of our sense-organ so we infer that the particular object is conducive to pleasure on the basis of the above judgment.

But still we hold that the assemblage of conditions visible and invisible renders itself supersensuous. The so-called power is nothing but the assemblage of conditions.

The Author of his mind, has remarked that if a judgment plays the part of an intermediate process then the judgment that an object is either worth-accepting or worth-rejecting or indifferent is the result of the means of perceptual knowledge. 141 Objection to the place of Paramarsa Judgment in the Definition of Perception Some interpreters of Nyāya-bhāṣya subscribe to a different view.

The phenomenon of memory is the cause of destruction of its condi- tion, i.e., the initial perception. The very moment when the initial perception passes away it is followed by the judgment that the wood-apple just now sensed, is conducive to pleasure. This judgment is equivalent to the judgment that the wood- apple is worth-having.

It is a memory judgment which owes its revival to the minor premise.

When this judgment remains fresh in one's memory the judgment that the in- ferred fire is conducive to pleasure like the previously known fire will come into being. Such a line of defence is not tenable since when fire will be inferred (deduced) the judgment should be simultaneously remembered.

The objection that if the hypothesis of the penultimate pre- mise of the Nyaya syllogism (i.e., the judgment involving the application of induction to a particular case) is not assum- ed then the term 'upanaya' becomes meaningless will be discussed in the proper context when the premises of a syllogism will be taken into consideration.

Now it may be answered that pleasure, the effect of the object is felt and from the effect we infer its cause, viz., its power of giving pleasure.

liṅgādyupāyāntarasaṃbhave tu yadi mana eva kevalaṃ kāraṇam ucyate tanmānasam evaikaṃ pramāṇaṃ syāt na catvāri pramāṇāni bhaveyur ity alaṃ prasaṅgena //	Merit, demerit and such other objects in some sense are not transcendental to our perception because they are in this context no better than an aspect of a material thing.
tasmāt sambandhagrahaṇakāle yat tat kapitthādiviṣayam akṣajaṃ jñānaṃ tat upādeyādijñānaphalam iti bhāṣyakṛtaś cetasi sthitam /	Now, how can you explain that, the causal relations holding between a wood-apple and pleasure is grasped by our eyes, one of the two terms remaining outside the range of our eyes? The answer to this question is that the relation is not visualised but is grasped by our inner perception.
sukhasādhanatvajñānam evopādeyādijñānam ity uktam //	We are immediately conscious of the feeling of pleasure, etc.

Let a means of proof be identical with its result. The veryConsciousness as the instrumental cause of itself refuted perception of a wood-apple which is produced by our eyes may be called the instrumental cause since it appears to function in and through an intermediate process in the shape of the illumi- nation of an object.
itthaṃ ca pramāṇaphale na bhinnādhikaraṇe bhaviṣyataḥ anyatra pramāṇaṃ anyatra phalam iti /	Thus, the means of proof and its result will not be inco-ordinate as they are supposed to be. The means of awareness and its result do never co-exist in the same locus.
tad uktam [savyāpārapratītitvāt pramāṇaṃ phalam eva sat] iti //	It has been stated (in Diinaga's Pramāṇasamuccaya) that perception seems to us to be possessed of an intermediate process and thus turns out to be the means of awareness but is really a result.
tad idam anupapannam pramāṇasya svarūpahāniprasaṅgāt /	This hypothesis of Dinnaga is not sound since it is open to the charge of depriv- ing a means of awareness of its very essence.
karaṇaṃ hi pramāṇam ucyate pramīyate cāneneti /	149 If we analyse the word 'pramăņa' into its elements, we get the root and the suffix.
na ca kriyaiva kvacit karaṇaṃ bhavati / kriyāyāṃ sādhyāyāṃ kāraṇaṃ kim api karaṇam ucyate /	An act itself is never an instrumental cause. But something else becomes the instrumental cause of an act which is to be accomplished.

Similarly, when we say that a man sees a jar with his eyes, the subject, the object and the instrument should be held as different from the act of seeing. Hence, the act of seeing is not an instrument.
pramā pramāṇam iti tu phale pramāṇaśabdasya sādhutvākhyānamātraṃ kṛtiḥ karaṇaṃ itivat // yat tu na bhinnādhikaraṇe pramāṇaphale itthaṃ bhaviṣyataḥ iti seyam apūrvavācoyuktiḥ /	The use of the word 'pramāņa' in the sense of the resultant consciousness is not a faulty one since the use of a word in an unusual sense is sometimes noticed. The word 'karaṇa' which usually denotes an instrument is also sanc- tioned by the current idiom to denote simply an act(kṛti).
kim atrādhikaraṇaṃ vivakṣitam yadi tāvad viṣayaḥ tad asty evaikaviṣayatvam /	What does he purport to convey by the term 'adhikaraṇa'? If any real object is merely meant by it then they two point to the same object.
yad viṣayaṃ hi darśanam sa eva cakṣurādeḥ karaṇasya viṣayaḥ /	The object which is grasped by the act of seeing is also the target of the instrumental cause of seeing, viz., the eyes etc.

asmatpakṣe tu bhinnāśrayor api phalakaraṇabhāvaḥ pākakāṣṭhayor dṛṣṭaḥ /	But, on the . other hand, we hold that the instrumental cause and its effect have been observed by us to stand upon the two distinct locii.
tathā cakṣurjñānayor api bhaviṣyatīti /	Similarly, the eyes and the visual perception will be held to be causally connected though they do not stand upon the same locus.
kvacit tu bhinnayor api jñānayoḥ phalakaraṇatvena sthitayoḥ liṅgaliṅgijñānayor iva viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyajñānayor iva caikātmyāśrayatvam asti /	On the other hand, in the same case two pieces of knowledge which are causally connected exist on the same locus like the knowledge of an invariable mark and that of the object marked and like the knowledge of a predicate and the relational know- ledge, i.e., a judgment.
na tv anena samānāśrayatvena prayojanam cakṣurādāv anirvahaṇāt //	There is no hard and fast rule that they must co-exist since the eyes do never exist on the locus of consciousness which is effectuated by them.

nanu vastusthityā phalam eva jñānaṃ phalam api tu bhavat viṣayānubhavaṃ prati vyāpṛtam iti /	Later on, the awareness of an object leads to another act of awareness. Self-consciousness intervenes between these two acts of awareness.

Thus an act of awareness may be as well an instrumental cause.) A rejoinder to the opponent is as follows:-May we request you to explain self- consciousness? Is it identical with or different from the aware- ness of an object? If you hold that self-consciousness is not a separate act then it is absurd to assert that self-consciousness follows from the awareness of an object.
bhede tv asmanmatānupraveśaḥ //	If you subscribe to the view that the awareness of an object is distinct from self-cons- ciousness then you really side with us.

After a thorough scrutiny of the above hypotheses we arrive at the conclusion that consci- ousness is by its nature object-awareness since the process of con- sciousness which is distinct from object-awareness and leads to object-awareness is not found out. The awareness of an object directly produces self-consciousness.
tatkṛtaś cābhimāna iti phalam eva jñānam avakalpate na karaṇam iti /	Thus, consciousness is always a result at first but is never an instrumental cause in the initial stage.
tathā hy ayaṃ vadati cakṣuṣā paśyāmi liṅgena jānāmīti na tu jñānena jānāmīti vyapadiśan kaścid dṛśyate //	"We see with our eyes and we know by means of a mark". But we find no body to say "I know by means of consciousness". The Buddhists review the above criticism and point out that the people designate eyes, etc.

But they do not call them as such if they do not generate the awareness of an object. It should also be borne in mind that they are so-called by the people because they are the cause of a cause but are not the direct cause of the awareness of an object. This review is152 Nyāyamanjarī not sound. The eyes and their like are the only cause but the cause of object consciousness is not produced by them.
kiṃ hi tad anyat karaṇam jñānam iti cet kasyāṃ kriyāyāṃ tat karaṇam iti parīkṣyatām etat /	If they produce at all a cause then what is this effect cause? If the Buddhists answer that consciousness which is a cause is generated by them then it is to be examined of which particular form of consciousness is the instrumental cause.
na hy ātmany eva kiñcit karaṇaṃ karaṇaṃ bhavatīti //	It is a truism that no cause is held to be a cause if it produces itself.
yat tu jñānam upajanayati cakṣurādau na karaṇatām ācaṣṭe lokaḥ tad yuktam eva /	In other words, it is untenable to hold that consciousness is an instrumental cause if it applies itself to itself as a cause. The view current among the people that eyes, etc.
na hi kriyotpattāv avyāpriyamāṇaṃ karaṇaṃ kārakaṃ bhavati /	If a condition does not operate to bring about an action then it does not become an instrumental cause.

Therefore, the designation of result given to consciousness is quite appropriate.
bhinnaṃ phalam upetavyaṃ ekatve tad asaṃbhavāt //	Hence, one and the same act of cognition cannot be both a pramāṇa and pramā its effect.
yas tu mūḍhataraḥ pramāṇaprameyaphalavyavahāram ekatraiva jñānātmani nirvāhayitum udyacchati [yad ābhāsaṃ prameyaṃ tat pramāṇaphalate punaḥ /	Every act of consciousness if self luminous). What is truly cognised is called prameya (an object of true knowledge). What illuminates correctly is called pramāņa (an instrumental cause) and the awareness of a particular form is called a result.

(This is the view of Dinnāga vide Pramāņa-samuccaya, chapter I, verse 11). We shall take this bad logician to task in the section on apa- varga (the absolute cessation of all sorrows) in connection with the refutation of Subjective Idealism.

That from which the resultant consciousness, arising from the sense-object-contact and having other characterizations, springs up is perception. The compound word 'indriya-artha-sannikarşa-utpanna' (arising from the sense-object-contact) is given in the sutra in order to distinguish this resultant consciousness from remembrance which is not produced by the object remembered and from the inferential knowledge which refers to an object lying beyond the range of sense-organs though it owes its existence to an object.
ataḥ tajjanakasya na pratyakṣatā prasajyate //	Thus the definition of perception is not too wide since it does neither apply to the source of memory nor to that of inference.
nanu indriyārthasannikarṣotpannam indriyagatyanumānam apy asti /	The inferential knowledge of the movement of sense-organ owes its existence to the sense-object-contact.

Likewise we infer the motion of the sun by means of sun's contract with the different parts of the horizon. How does the adjective-clause 'arising from the sense-object-contact distinguish perception from inference?" We solve this problem thus. The above-mentioned clause suggests that the sense-organ coming in contact with the object produces perceptual know- ledge.
na ced dṛśam indriyagatyanumānam //	The inferential knowledge of the movement of a sense- organ is not thus produced by the sense-organ.
kuto viśeṣapratilambha iti cet utpannagrahaṇād iti brūmaḥ / utpannagrahaṇena hi sannikarṣasya kārakatvaṃ khyāpyate / tac cāpīndriyaviṣaye 'rthe jñānam utpādayato nirvahati /	How do you mark off the origin of one knowledge from that of another? An answer to this question is that the word 'utpanna' (generated by) clearly indicates their difference. It suggests that the sense-object-contact produces perceptual knowledge which re- fers only to such object as comes in contact with the sense-organ.
indriyagatyanumāne tu na sannikarṣaṃ kārakam āhuḥ api tu jñāpakam /	The sense-object-contact does not produce the inferential know- ledge of the movement of a sense-organ but simply indicates it.
ata eva svagrahaṇasāpekṣaḥ tadanumāne 'sau vyāpriyate na rūpādipramitāv iva tannirapekṣa iti //	Therefore, the knowledge of the sense-object-contact is essential in case of an inference but, on the other hand, in case of perceptual knowledge, e. g., the direct awareness of colour154 the very presence of sense-object-contact is required.

The followers of the Vaiseșika system hold that the sensed objects are those which are grasped by both the organs of sight and touch.

Sound inheres in the sky which assumes the form of the ears under certain conditions and the universal of sound inheres in sound.

nanu sannikarṣāvagame kiṃ pramāṇam vyavahitānupalabdhir iti brūmaḥ /	155- How can we prove the existence of sense-object-contact? We say in reply because we cannot perceive a veiled object.

But it is a fact that they do not sense the veiled ones.
nanu avyavadhānam evāstu kiṃ sannikarṣeṇa maivam indriyāṇāṃ kārakatvena prāpyakāritvāt /	Such a contention is not tenable. As the sense-organs are the instrumental cause of the act of perception so they must be united with the other conditions of perception.

As the rest sense-organs share some common character with the above two so it is assumed that they also come in contact with the objects of which they produce perception.

It has been mentioned to indicate the six- fold division of sense-object-contact.
utpannagrahaṇena indriyārthayor jñānajanakatvaṃ darśayati /	The word 'utpanna' (generated by) suggests that both the sense-organ and the object condition the perception of an object.

nanu arthasya jñānajanakatvaṃ kuto 'vagamyate tadviṣayajñānotpādād eva /	How is it known that the object is causally connected with the act of perception? The answer is that the objection ques- tion is only organised, the representative character of consci- qusness has been refuted and the definite relation obtaining between an act of perception and a particular object is hard to establish.
svatas sākāratvasya nirākṛtatvāt /	You simply state the necessity of your assumption.

By the methods of agreement and difference based upon perception, and perception assisted by non- perception the causal relation subsisting between viraņa (straw) and kața (mat) is detected. Similarly, the same relation holding between an object and its perception is detected. Let us take an example.
yathā hi devadattārthī kaścit gṛhaṃ gataḥ tatrāsannihitaṃ na paśyati devadattam kṣaṇāntare cainam āyāntaṃ paśyati tatrānvayavyatirekābhyāṃ devadattasadasattvānuvartinau jñānotpādānutpādāv avadhārya mānasena pratyakṣeṇa candanasukhavad asya tatkāraṇatāṃ pratipadyate //	A person in search of Devadatta visits his house but does not see him there since he is absent at that time. After a while, when he comes back he is seen by the person. Thus we see that when Devadatta is present he is perceived but when he is absent he is not perceived. Hence, by the joint method of agreement and difference, we learn that the perception of Devadatta and his non-perception follow respectively his presence and absence.
nanu vīraṇakaṭayoḥ pṛthag upalaṃbhāt yukta eṣa nyāyaḥ arthas tu jñānāt pṛthak na kadācid upalabhyata iti duradhigamau tatrānvayavyatirekau ucyate ayam eva pṛthag upalaṃbhaḥ yadasannihite 'rthe na tad viṣayam abādhitaṃ jñānam utpadyata iti /	It is, there- fore, reasonable to admit that the causal relation subsisting between them is detected by means of the joint method of agreement and difference. But an object is never cognized as distinct from its awareness. Hence, the application of the joint method of agreement and difference, in the above case, to ascertain the causal relation subsisting between an object and its perception, is inadmissible. The distinct awareness of an object consists in this that the true perception of an object does not take place when an object lies beyond the field of percep- tion.
tad alam asminn avasare jñānavādagarbhacodyodbibhāvayiṣayā bhaviṣyaty etadavasare iti //	Hence, by the joint method of agreement and difference, we learn that the perception of Devadatta and his non-perception follow respectively his presence and absence.
yathā cendriyāṇāṃ karaṇānāṃ anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ jñānakāraṇatvaṃ evam arthasya karmaṇo 'pīty utpannagrahaṇena darśitam //	The word 'utpanna' of the adjective clause suggests that as the joint method of agreement and difference proves that the sense organs are the necessary condi- tions of perception so it proves that the object which is perceiv- ed is also a condition of its perception.

The individual soul is conjoined to the internal organ, which is in contact with the external sense-organ which is united with the coloured substance in which colour, the object in question, inheres.
sukhādau tu trayasannikarṣāt jñānam utpadyate tatra cakṣurādivyāpārābhāvāt /	The inner perception of inter- nal phenomena such as pleasure etc. requires two contacts to be produced since the external organs such as eyes etc.

ātmamanasos tu sad api jñānajanakatvam iha na sūtritam sarvapramāṇasādhāraṇatvāt // jñānagrahaṇaṃ viśeṣyanirdeśārtham /	The sutra on perception does not include the contact of the soul with the internal organ in the list of the causal factors of perception though it is one of its conditions because the above contact is the common factor of all forms of consciousness but not a special condition of percep- tion.
tasya hi indriyārthasannikarṣotpannatvādīni viśeṣaṇāni /	There are several adjectives and adjective clauses in the sutra, e.g., 'indriyàrtha' etc.

tatra tajjanakaṃ kārakacakraṃ pramāṇaṃ mā bhūt jñānajanakam eva pramāṇaṃ yathā syād iti jñānagrahaṇam //	The assemblage of conditions which is the source of pleasure should not be mistaken for a proof. But the source of true knowledge should only be called a proof.
atra śākyāś codayanti na jñānapadena sukhādivyavacchedaḥ kartuṃ yuktaḥ śakyo vā sukhādīnām api jñānasvabhāvatvāt /	In order to indicate the instrument of true knowledge the word 'jääna' finds an important place in the sūtra.Nyāyamanjari 158 The Buddhists hold that Consciousness itself is pleasure The Buddhists join issue with this solution. It is not proper to exclude pleasure, etc.
jñānasyaivāmī bhedāḥ sukhaṃ duḥkhaṃ icchā dveṣaḥ prayatna iti /	Pleasure, pain, desire, hatred, and vo- lition are nothing but the forms of consciousness.

In other words, inference is not strong enough to establish the identity of pleasure with consciousness. The Buddhists cannot even hold that pleasure, pain etc. are essentially consciousness and the transformation of them are mirth, dejection etc. Different names may be given to these derivatives according to the sweet will of a person.
jñānam eva viṣayagrahaṇarūpaṃ prakāśate na sukhaṃ duḥkhaṃ vā //	We are always aware of our awareness as illuminating an object but no feelings of pleasure and pain are intuited as revealing an object.

But pleasure or pain is never experienced as involving a reference to an object. The awareness of pleasure and that of pain are two distinct forms of consciousness. They are not different by their own nature, as a doubt and an illusion differ from each other by their essential character.
viparyayo 'pi viṣayagrahaṇātmaka eva viparītam asantaṃ vā viṣayaṃ gṛhṇāti /	An illusion also reveals an object. It either mistakes one thing for another or reveals an absence of object.
na tu viṣayagrahaṇasvabhāvaṃ sukhaṃ duḥkhaṃ cānubhūyate /	But neither pleasure nor pain is experienced as an awareness revealing an object. Pleasure and pain are merely inner phenomena.

The awareness of pleasure and pain are distinct from each other on the basis of their references to the objects like the awareness of a jar but unlike a doubt which is essentially different. (In other words, the awareness of plea- sure distinguishes itself from that of pain because pleasure and pain which are referred to by them are mutually different.
ataś ca grāhyagrahaṇobhayasvabhāvatvāt jñānam eva tad iti maivaṃ vocaḥ svaprakāśatvaṃ jñāne 'pi pratikṣiptam pratikṣepsyate ca /	The awareness of a jar is also distinct from that of other objects because a jar which is referred to is distinct from the other objects. But a doubt is distinct from the other forms of con- sciousness because the specific character of this type of consci- ousness is essentially different from that of the other forms of consciousness.
tat kutaḥ sukhādau bhaviṣyati /	Now the Buddhists may contend that pleasure, pain, etc.
na hi grahaṇasvabhāvaṃ kaścit sukham anubhavati jñānavad iti //	are not merely objects of knowledge since they are self-luminous; they are also self-conscious.

If consciousness is not self-luminous then how is it that pleasure, pain etc. are to be admitted as self-luminous? The reason behind our criticism is obvious since no body experiences pleasure, etc. as self-conscious conscious- ness.
praty uta svaprakāśasukhavādinām eṣa doṣaḥ svaprakāśasukhotpādāt tenaiva svaprakāśena sukhenānyo 'pi sukhī syāt yasyāpi sukhaṃ notpannam iti //	If the Buddhists stick to the hypo- thesis that pleasure is self-luminous then though it may arise in a particular series yet it should render happy the members of the other series as well.

Or does an individual phenomenon of conscious- ness partake of the character of pain? If the Buddhists sub- scribe to the first alternative then one should simultaneously experience both pleasure and pain contrary to each other with the appearance of his consciousness which is partly pleasure and partly pain.
uttarasmiṃs tu kiñcit sukhajñānaṃ kiñcid duḥkhajñānam iti yat kiñcid asukhaduḥkhakhacitaṃviṣayānubhavasvabhāvam api jñānam anubhūyamānam eṣitavyam eva /	If the Buddhists accept the second alternative then as some forms of consciousness are to be held as pleasure and some other forms of consciousness are to be held as pain so they should also admit the verdict of experience that some other forms of consciousness are neutral and that they are nei- ther pleasure nor pain but they reveal their objects only. The last type of consciousness is not absolutely blank, i.e.
tac ca na svaccham api tu kenacid ghaṭādinā viṣayeṇoparaktaṃ anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ ca ghaṭādyupajananāpāye 'pi bodhasvabhāvam anuvartamānaṃ pratīyate /	This type of consciousness even involves a reference to an object which has ceased to exist.

In the light of this type of consci- ousness if we try to understand the real character of the cons- ciousness of pleasure then we arrive at the conclusion that consciousness itself is not pleasure but it involves a reference to pleasure which is its object as it does with regard to a jar, its object.
tasmāt na bodharūpāḥ sukhādayaḥ //	Hence pleasure or pain is not consciousness.
abhinnahetujatvād iti cāyam asiddho hetuḥ samavāyikāraṇasyātmanaḥ asamavāyikāraṇasya cātmamanaśaṃyogasya cābhede 'pi nimittakāraṇasya sukhatvajñānatvāder bhinnatvāt //	The Buddhists infer that pleasure is consciousness because the conditions of pleasure and those of consciousness are the same. The reason is materially invalid. The inherent cause being the soul, is the same. Similarly, the non-inherent cause which is the contact of the internal organ with the soul is also the same.
nanu sukhotpādāt pūrvam anāśrayaṃ sukhatvasāmānyaṃ kathaṃ tatra syāt kaś cāsya sukhahetubhiḥ kārakaiḥ saṃsargaḥ asaṃsṛṣṭaṃ vā kathaṃ kārakaṃ syāt ucyate sarvagatāni sāmānyāni sādhayiṣyanta iti santi tatrāpi sukhatvādīni /	Hence, before the appearance of plea- sure, how can the universal of pleasure be present there? How can the universal of pleasure be united with the other causes of pleasure? Which will be the specific relation that binds them together? If the universal of pleasure stands unrelated then how can it be a cause? A reply to these objections is this:--- It will be proved later on that all the universals are omnipre- sent.
yogyatālakṣaṇa eva caiṣāṃ sukhahetubhiḥ kārakaiḥ saṃsargaḥ dharmādharmavat /	It co- operates with the other causes of pleasure in order to bring about the effect, viz., pleasure. Co-operation is the specific relation.

tasmāt nimittakāraṇabhedāt bhinnāni jñānasukhādīni kāryāṇi // nimittakāraṇānyatvam api kāryasya bhedakam /	Hence consciousness and pleasure are not identical since their efficient causes are different. The difference in the efficient causes accounts for the diver- sity in the nature of effects.
vilakṣaṇā hi dṛśyante ghaṭādau pākajā guṇāḥ //	The natural colour of a jar is des- troyed when it is burat by fire.
api ca jñānam icchanti na sarve jñānapūrvakam /	All logicians do not agree on the point that consciousness isNyāyamanjari 162 always preceded by another antecedent consciousness.
sukhaduḥkhādi sarvaṃ tu viṣayajñānapūrvakam // viṣayānubhavotpādyāḥ yatrāpi na sukhādayaḥ /	But pleasure, pain and other feelings are invariably preceded by the knowledge of an object which one seeks either to obtain or to avoid. Pleasure, pain, etc.
tatrāpi teṣām utpattau kāraṇaṃ viṣayasmṛtiḥ //	are not always preceded by the direct awareness of an object.
kvacit tu saṅkalpo 'pi sukhasya kāraṇatāṃ pratipadyate /	In some cases, the self-consciousness of a resolution leads to pleasure.
tasmāt sarvaṃ sukhādi jñānapūrvakam eva //	Therefore, the proposition that pleasure and other feelings are preceded by consciousness is universal.
jñānam api jñānapūrvakam eveti cet na upariṣṭān nirākariṣyamāṇatvāt / na hi garbhādau madamūrchādyanantaraṃ vā jñānam upajāyamānaṃ jñānāntarapūrvakaṃ bhavatīti vakṣyāmaḥ /	The hypothesis that consciousness precedes cons- ciousness will be refuted later on. The dawn of consciousness of a foetal baby is not preceded by antecedent consciousness. The appearance of consciousness after a period of unconscious state due to an attack of swoon is not due to the said an- tecedent consciousness.

The 'Jñana' (awareness) has been given in the sutra on perception in order to preclude pleasure, etc., from perceptual awareness. The Refutation of a probable doubt that the adjective avyabhicãri is enough to suggest the noun jñāna and that the use of the term jñāna is redundant It is a fact that truth and falsehood are the specific proper- ties of knowledge.
atas tadupādānāt taddharmayogi jñānaṃ labhyata eva / kiṃ jñānagrahaṇena naitad evam sukhasyāpi savyabhicārasya dṛṣṭatvāt /	In that case, is the term 'jñāna' not superfluous? The whole objection is based upon a wrong assumption that truth and falsehood are the specific properties of awareness since un- real pleasure is also experienced by all.
kiṃ punas sukhaṃ vyabhicāravat dṛṣṭam yad etat paradārābhimarśādiniṣiddhācaraṇasaṃbhavaṃ sukhaṃ tadvyabhicāri //	Which pleasure is ex- perienced as unreal? The pleasure which is derived from doing forbidden deeds such as the enjoyment of another's wife, etc.
nanu sukhasya kīdṛśo vyabhicāraḥ jñānasyāpi kīdṛśo vyabhicāraḥ atasmiṃs tathābhāvaḥ sukhasyāpi atasmiṃs tathābhāva eva //	What makes pleasure false? What makes a piece of knowledge false? False knowledge is such as asserts a predi- cate of a thing which has not in reality the property corre- sponding to the predicate. Similarly, false pleasure is also a case of wrong reference.
kiṃ parapurandhrīpariraṃbhasaṃbhavaṃ sukhaṃ sukhaṃ na bhavati kiṃ śuktikāyāṃ rajatajñānaṃ jñānaṃ na bhavati jñānaṃ bhavati kintu mithyā idam api sukhaṃ bhavati kintu mithyā //	Does not the pleasure derived from the enjoyment of another's wife produce pleasant sensation? Does not a false knowledge, e.g., the mistaking of conch-shell for silver reveal an object? Yes, it is a piece of knowledge but a false one.
nanu na sukhaṃ mithyā tad api hy ānandasvabhāvam eva yady evaṃ śuktikāyāṃ rajatajñānam api na mithyā tad api hi viṣayānubhavasvabhāvam eva //	It is not false since it is nothing but a pleasant feeling. If you argue like this then the mistaking of conchshell for silver is not false since its essence lies in the illumination of an object.
nanu viṣayānubhavasvabhāvam api taj jñānaṃ viṣayaṃ vyabhicarati sukham api tarhīdam ānandasvabhāvam api svahetuṃ viṣayaṃ vyabhicaraty eva //	You may answer that though an illusion reveals an object yet it contains a wrong reference. We may also answer in the same strain that though false pleasure is a pleasant feeling yet it is not produced by a real cause.

We may also raise a similar question. Is an illusion produced by a cause which does not produce consciousness? Your answer to the question will be that it is produced by a real cause but its reference is wrong since it is contradicted by perception. Pleasure is produced by a condition which is condu- cive to pleasure but such a condition has been prohibited by the Sastras such as the enjoyment of another's wife. Is not another's wife a real condition of pleasure? In case of an illusion also the object which is wrongly referred to is also real.
nanu śāstreṇa kim atra bādhyate jñāne 'pi pratyakṣeṇa kiṃ bādhyate viṣayo mithyeti khyāpyate śāstreṇāpi sukhasya hetur mithyeti khyāpyate //	How does the scripture contradict it? How does percep- tion contradict an illusion? "The object which is referred to by an illusion is not true" is the verdict of perception. It is also declared by the scriptures that the cause which produces pleasure is now a source of true pleasure.
kiṃ sa viṣayas sukhahetur na bhavati yathā tv eṣa viṣayaḥ kaluṣasya jñānasya hetuḥ tathā so 'pi kaluṣasya kaṭuvipākasya sukhasya hetur iti tathāvidhaṃ sukham api vyabhicāri bhavaty evety alam atikelinā //	Is not that object conducive to pleasure ? As the object referred to by an illusion is the condition of untrue knowledge so the condemned source of pleasure produces such pleasure as turns out to be misery in the end. Such bitterNyayamanjari pleasure is called unreal.
tasmāt samānanyāyatvāt sukhe vyabhicāritā 'stīti avyabhicāripadāt jñānaṃ na labhyate //	For the same reasons pleasure should also be admitted to be un- real. Hence the adjective phrase 'not untrue' does not in- variably qualify apprehension.
apara āha kim anena ḍimbhakalahena mā bhūdavyabhicāripadāt jñānasya lābhaḥ tathā 'pi vyavasāyātmakapadāt labhyata eva jñānam /	Some other logicians hold that this foolish disputation is of no use. The word 'avyabhicãri' may not be suggestive of the term ‘jñāna' but the word 'vyavasāyātmaka' (determinate) suggests it.
na hi sukhaduḥkhādayo vyavasāyātmakāḥ bhavanti kintu jñānam eva tathāvidham iti //	The adjective 'determinate' is not applicable to pleasure, pain etc., but is applicable only to consciousness.
saṃśayavyavacchedārthaṃ tatpadam iti cet satyam sukhādivyavacchedam api kartum alam eva bhavati vyavasāyātmakatvasya sukhādiṣv asaṃbhavād iti //	It is not only competent enough to exclude a doubt from perception but also it is competent enough to distinguish perception from pleasure, pain etc. since it is impossible to use an expression like this that pleasure or pain is determinate.
tad evaṃ siddhe 'pi sukhādivyavacchede kartavyam eva jñānagrahaṇam viśeṣyanirdeśārthatvāt tasya hi sarvāṇy amūni viśeṣaṇāny upāttāni tadanupādāne nirālambanāni bhaveyuḥ /	Thus, without mentioning the word 'jñāna' perception is easily distinguished from pleasure, pain etc. In spite of this fact the word 'jñana’ should find a place in the sūtra since the noun should be mentioned by the denotative term. All the adjectives are given in the sutra.
śrotuś ca buddhir na samādhīyeteti /	Moreover, the attention of the listener will be diverted, having no concrete object to concentrate upon.
tena balād gamyamānam eva kartavyam eva jñānagrahaṇam arthākṣiptasyāvacane pratyakṣaṃ pratyakṣam ity etāvanmātram abhidheyaṃ syāt anyadarthāl labhyata eva /	jñāna should be specifically mentioned in the sutra. If we do not mention what is intelligently guessed by an adequate expression then the word of the sutra would be "pratyakṣam pratyakşam' since everything else, given in the present sūtra, can be easily guess- ed.
tasmāt dharminirdeśārthaṃ yuktaṃ jñānapadam //	Therefore, the sūtra has done the right thing viz. the use of the word 'jñāna' in order to state clearly the substantive.
śabdānām arthasaṃsparśitvaṃ śākyamatanirāsena sādhayiṣyata iti śabdānupraveśavaśena vyapadeśyaṃ nāma jñānam upapadyata iti tadvyavacchedārtham avyapadeśyapadam //	When words inter- penetrate our knowledge it is called vyapadeśya i.e. it becomes inter-woven with words. In order to exclude such knowledgeInterpretation of the word Auyapadesya 165 from perception the word avyapadeśyam (not inter-mixed with words) has been given.
tatra vṛddhanaiyāyikās tāvad ācakṣate vyapadiśyata iti vyapadeśyaṃ śabdakarmatāpannaṃ jñānam ucyate /	What finds expression in words is called 'vyapa- deśyam'. Thus, an expressible knowledge is designated as vyapadeśyam.

Such an interpretation is untenable.
yadi hi tat rūpajñānaṃ rasajñānaṃ ca viṣayāvyabhicāri niśaṃśayaṃ ca tat katham apramāṇaphalam ucyate / vyabhicārādidoṣayoge vā padāntareṇa tatpratikṣepāt kim avyapadeśyapadena pramāṇaphalaṃ ca tad vijñānaṃ idānīṃ kiṃ pramāṇaprabhavaṃ bhavatu na pratyakṣaphalam etat padapratikṣiptatvāt / nānumānādijanyam tadvailakṣaṇyāt /	If the awareness of colour or that of taste is represented by language but it rightly refers to its object and does not oscillate between two objects then how can it be called as a false one? If it contains a wrong reference then the term 'avyabhicări' given in the sutra is competent enough to exclude it from the domain of true perception. In that case, is not the term in question superfluous? In due course it will be shown that the awareness interpenetrated by a word owes its existence to the source of valid knowledge. What will be its fate? Will it be excluded from the state of being the resulting perception by the mere term 'avyapadeśyam' contained in the sutra in spite of the fact that it is generated by the source of valid knowledge? It is not also produced by the source of an inferential knowledge.
nāsti kiñcit pañcamaṃ pramāṇam /	There is also no provision in Gautama's logic of the fifth source of valid knowledge.
asaṅgraho 'sya lakṣyasya lakṣaṇeneti prajñāpramādaḥ /	Hence, it is a riddle which defies the finding of our intelligence (or it represents a glaring instance of oversight on the part of our intelligence).
tasmād apavyākhyānam etat //	Therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that the so-called interpretation is really a misinterpretation.
vyavacchedyāntaram avyapadeśyapadasya varṇayāñ cakrur ācāryāḥ /	Some teachers of the Nyaya School have shown, that the term 'avyapadeiya' excludes some other form of knowledge from the domain of perception.

He listens to the sentence of an expert that this is aNyayamanjari jack-fruit tree.
tad asya jñānam indriyajam api na kevalendriyakaraṇakaṃ bhavitum ucitam asati saṃjñopadeśini śabde tadanutpādāt /	Though the apprehension of the tree is of sensuous origin yet it should not be solely sensuous since if the sentence which throws light on its name had not been present then his present apprehension would not have arisen.
tena śabdendriyābhyāṃ saṃbhūya janitatvāt ubhayajam idaṃ jñānaṃ vyapadeśāj jātam iti vyapadeśyam ucyate /	Hence words and his sense organ have jointly produced it. It is an effect of the joint effort of the two types of causes. As words play an important part in its production so it is called as Vyapadeśyam.
tat avyapadeśyapadena vyudasyate //	Such an apprehen- sion is excluded by the term 'avyapadeśyam'.

Therefore, the proposal of a fifth type of knowledge does not mature. But the people hold that it is a piece of verbal knowledge. If somebody asks him, "How do you know that this is a jack-fruit tree" then he says in reply, "I have been instructed by Devadatta that it is so and so".
na punar evaṃ vismṛtyāpi bravīti [cakṣuṣā mayā pratipannaṃ panaso 'yam ucyata iti] iti /	But again, he does never say even in a dream "I have seen it with my eyes that it is a jack-fruit tree".

For this reason, the author of the Nyâya-sūtra has not framed the definition of verbal knowledge in such a way as to exclude the dependence of verbal knowledge upon a sense-organ as its condition.
ataś cendriyānupraveśe 'pi śābdatām asya manyate sūtrakāraḥ //	Gautama also approves the entry of a sensuous element into the body of verbal knowledge.
iha punaḥ avyapadeśyaviśeṣaṇapadopādānena śabdānupraveśapratiṣedhāt na pratyakṣam etat jñānam /	But he has narrow- ed down the scope of perception as he shuts his door against an element of verbal knowledge, having qualified perception by the term "avyapadeśya". Hence, experience interpenetrated by words cannot be the resulting form of perception.
tasmād evaṃvidhavyapadeśyavijñānavyavacchedārtham avyapadeśyapadam iti //	There- fore, the term 'avyapadeśya' has been used to exclude the above experience from the perception proper.

Again,Interpretation of the word Auyapadesya if it is true then it should be decided with which kind of true knowledge it is to be identified.
bhavatv akṣajam apy etat tadbhāvānuvidhānataḥ //	It is also sensuous since it is causally connected with the sense-organs and its causal relation is also similarly detected.
śābdaṃ cobhayajaṃ ceti viruddham abhidhīyate / pramāṇāntaram eva syāt itthaṃ tad api pūrvavat //	Again, if it is held that it is a class by itself then such a hypothesis meets with the dilemma which has been shown before.

What a fine decision! The author of Nyaya-Sūtra, being a man of super intellect, has little faith in popular saying like an ordinary fellow.
loko hi yathāruci vyapadiśati /	The character of an object is not such as the people believe and express.

From this attitude of his mind, we come to the conclusion that piece of knowledge which is produced not by words alone but by words accompanied by some other factors required for the appearance of some other form is of knowledge surely verbal. A critical review of the above hypothesis is as follows: The author of the Nyāya-Sutra is not an instructor of moral duty like Manu so that we should hold that the piece of knowledge in question is verbal as he so commands.Nyayamanjari On an adequate examination of the nature of this object we find that this piece of knowledge is perceptual since it is causally determined by the sense-organ and this causal connection is based upon the joint method of agreement and difference.

We shall follow a different line of interpretation since we are divided in our opinion. In other words, we mean to say that we may be right in our interpretation but our opponents are not satisfied with our interpretation.

evaṃ hi paro manyate sati lakṣye lakṣaṇavarṇanam ucitam /	A critical thinker discusses the point thus :- If an object to be defined is existent then its definition is given.
iha tu lakṣyamāṇaṃ pratyakṣam indriyārthasannikarṣotpannaṃ nāma na kiñcid asti / gaur ityādijñānānāṃ śabdāvacchinnavācyaviṣayatvena śābdatvāt /	But perception which arises from the sense-object-contact does not really exist if perception refers to the object as qualifed by a word which denotes it. The so called perception referring to a qualified object as indicated above is essentially verbal.
iha hi viṣayavyatirekeṇa jñānānām atiśayo durupapādaḥ bodhasvabhāvasya sarvān pratyaviśiṣṭatvāt /	The distinction-perceptions cannot be established if their reference to their corresponding different objects is not admitted. The function of consciousness is simply to reveal an object.

Similarly, the judgment that this is a cow is distinct since it refers to an object which is qualified by its name. Such a judgment (i.e. a judgment similar to the last one) is verbal since a word is the only instrumental cause of it.

But if the possibility of a source of knowledge as an instrumental cause is not ruled out then the causality of the inner organ should not be relied upon.
tathā hi sati mānasam evaikaṃ pramāṇaṃ syād iti /	If we violate this rule then the inner organ should be the only source of valid knowledge.

sa idānīm atikrānta iti kathaṃ tatkṛta eṣa pratyayaḥ syāt ucyate tadānīm aśrūyamāṇasya śabdasya smṛtyārūḍhasya tatpratyayahetutvāt //	The word has ceased to exist. How is it that the judgment in question is due to the instrumentality of the past word? Do not think that we entertain such an absurd hypothesis. Though the word is not heard at the time of the formation of the judgment yet it being recalled in our memory, generates it.
tacchrutāv api kiṃ sarve varṇāḥ pratyakṣagocarāḥ /	When the particular word consisting of many letters is heard do we really perceive all the letters at a time? (When we actually hear the last letter the first has passed away.

tad evaṃ smṛtiviṣayīkṛtaśabdajanita eṣa pratyaya ity abhyupetavyaḥ /	Thus it should be admitted that judgment of this type refers to an object which is qualified by a word which denotes it.

He holds that the word 'saṁjñítva' is a classical example of an object having a word as its predicate. Let us see the derivation of the word 'samjñitva'. The noun 'saṁjñã' is the base. The nominal suffix in 'having the sense of 'matup' suffix has been attached to it.
yathā ''ha bhaṭṭaḥ [saṃjñitvaṃ kevalaṃ param] iti // saṃjñitvam iti matvarthīyapratyayāntād utpannaḥ bhāvapratyayaḥ saṃbandham ācaṣṭe /	But the nominał suffix 'tva' denotes a relation when it is attached to a word which is derived from a basic word with a nominal suffix imply- ing the sense of the 'matup' suffix added to it.
saṃjñāsaṃjñisaṃbandhaḥ saṃjñitvam iti /	Thus the word 'samjñitva' denotes the relation obtaining between 'samjñā and 'samjñin'.
[kṛttaddhitasamāseṣu sambandhābhidhānaṃ bhāvapratyayena] ity abhiyuktasmaraṇāt /	If we recall the ruling of the learned gramma- rians on this point in our mind then we see that the-tva suffix after a word derived from a root with a verbal suffix attached to it or that derived from a base a nominal suffix attached to it or a compound word signifies a relation.
saṃjñā ca śabdaḥ /	The term 'saṁjñā' stands for a word.
so 'yaṃ śabdaviśiṣṭārthapratibhāsa ukto bhavati //	Thus the import of the word 'samjñítva' is that an object which is denoted by a word is presented to our consciousness along with its denotative word as its predicate.

When definite words are not presented to our consciousness there is possibility of some general words being associated with our consciousness. If words are not associated with consciousness then consciousness lacks its power of illumination.

viśeṣaṇībhūtasya tu śabdasya grahaṇe kiṃ karaṇam iti nirūpyatām /	But let us now find out the instrumental cause of a judgment in which the word plays the part of a mere predicate.

sambandhagrahaṇād ūrdhvaṃ ca smaryamāṇaśabdayojanayā jāyamāne gaur ityādijñāne śrotraṃ karaṇam āśaṅkitum api na yuktam /	If we closely examine the process of associating the synthetic judgment that this is a cow with words then we at once abandon the idea of entertaining the hypothesis that the auditory organ is the instrumental cause of it.

The inner organ unaided by an external sense-organ, is not competent to produce a judgment which refers to an external object; other- wise, no body should be blind, etc. The objector may urge that the words alone play, here, the part of an instrumental cause and may suggest that one should not search for another instrumental cause.
savitṛprakāśavat iti cet na kriyābhedāt /	When sun's light is an instrumental case it is not an objective case and vice versa.

When we see light we require no instrumental cause like light. How is it that we see without light? We are to accept facts but cannot challenge them. We see an object such as a jar with the aid of light.

Sun's light is, at first, seen independently of any other light with our eyes. It endures long and serves the purpose of an instrumental cause when the other objects are beheld with the same organ. This conclusion seems to us to be reasonable.

It is audible. If it plays the part an instrument when the consciousness of an object which is grasped by a source of knowledge other than the audi- tory organ is produced then how can it be an object of such awareness?

Thus, when we know the object it is in no way possible for us to cognize the word itself.

What is it that makes an illusion? Is it so since the sense-organ does not produce it? Or, is it so because it does not correspond to the object referred to by it? Now, if it is held that it is illusion because of its non-sensuous origin then the phrase 'not produced by the sense-object-con- tact' being sufficient to exclude an illusion from perception the phrase 'not corresponding' should be abandoned as superfluous.
tadupādānāt vyabhicāritvenāsya bhrāntatvam iti nūnam idam indriyajam asannihitasalilajñānam abhyupagantavyam //	Thus it should be surely assumed that the illusory judgment which refers to water not united with the sense-organ is produced by the sense-organ.

A word cannot communicate its meaning if the signification of a word remains unknown. The signification of a word is not grasped if one has only the in- determinate perception of the object denoted by it.

It is due to the function of the external organ since it is causally connected with it and the causal rela- tion is determined by the joint method of agreement and difference. Some stalwart followers of the line of the objector come forward with a new objection and hold that it has been proved to the hilt that the judgment that this is a cow and such other judgments do not refer to objects, qualified by their denotative terms.
upāyo buddhāv atiśayam ādadhāti na viṣaye //	When we hear the term—'a club-man', a man who carries a club is present to our consciousness.
viṣayāvagatisamaye ca na buddhir avabhātīti naiyāyikāḥ /	Again, a man and a club are not present to our consciousness as unrelated since the club qualifies the man i.e.
tad ayam atiśayaḥ yad adhikaraṇaḥ sā na pratibhāsate buddhiḥ yac ca tadānīm avabhāsate viṣayaḥ tatrātiśayo nāsti dṛśyate cātiśayasaṃvedanam iti saṅkaṭaḥ panthāḥ /	the relation of the qualifying to the qualified governs this consciousness which arises from the knowledge of the term 'a club-man' (The drift of the whole argument is that the diffe- rence in the nature of an object explains only the difference in the corresponding awareness).
na ca dūrāvidūradeśavartini padārthe pratītir upāyabhedāt bhidyate /	ponding to the words 'remote, near, slow, quick, successive, simultaneous etc.' refer to an object which is either qualified by space or by Time.
sā 'pi hi viṣayabhedād eva bhidyate // dūrād dhi vastusāmānyaṃ dharmamātropalakṣitam /	This admission also points to the acceptance of the hypothesis that the relation of inherence is perceived under certain circum- stances.
adūratas tu vispaṣṭaviśeṣam avasīyate // yathā māghena varṇitam [cayas tviṣām ity avadhāritaṃ purā tataḥ śarīrīti vibhāvitākṛtim /	The judgment that the cloth rests upon this (the collec- tion of interlaced threads) reveals that the cloth inherent in the threads, is perceived. (Thus, the relation of inherence which unites the cloth with the threads is perceived).
kriyāntarāṇāṃ vaicitrye yad vā tad vā 'stu kāraṇam /	The judgment that this is a piece of cloth is distinct from the judgment that this piece of cloth inheres in the threads.
bhedo jñānakriyāyās tu karmabhedanibandhanaḥ // tad etad ācāryāḥ pratisamādadhate na viṣayabhedād eva pratibhāsabhedaḥ kintu upāyabhedāt bhavaty eva //	If the relation of inherence which subsists between this piece of cloth and the threads is not perceived then the distinction between the above two judgments will not arise since the apprehension of the cloth alone cannot account for the distinction.
yac ca coditam viṣayapratibhāsakāle tatpratibhāsāpratibhāsāt atiśayavacane saṅkaṭaḥ panthā iti tadaviditanaiyāyikadarśanasyaiva codyam /	Now, a second alternative suggestion on this point is as follows: The difference in the two awarenesses focused upon the same object is explained by the distinction in the nature of conditions. The following illustrations will bring home our point.
jñānotpāda eva viṣayasya pratikṣateti no darśanaṃ na jñānagrahaṇam iti /	The same post is differently presented to our consciousness when it stands close at hand or is far away from us.

The difference in the nature of awareness due to the diversity of conditions is hard to establish. The condition brings about some special feature in the effect viz., an act of awareness reveals but cannot alter an object in the least. But the Naiyāyikas hold that when one is aware of an object he is not aware of the awareness of an object.
evaṃ daṇḍinaṃ bhojaya daṇḍine dehīti bhojanādikāryayogitvaṃ na daṇḍe dṛśyate api tu puṃsy eva //	Moreover, when we say "Feed a club-man --and give it to a club-man" then we ask some body to feed a man or to give him something. But in these cases the acts of feeding and giving have no bearing upon the stick.
nanu daṇḍī parvatam ārohatīti daṇḍe 'pi kāryānvayo dṛśyate loke vede 'pi [daṇḍī maitrāvaruṇaḥ praiṣānanvāha] iti praiṣānuvaṃcanasya vacanāntarataḥ prāpteḥ daṇḍavidhānārtham etad vākyaṃ bhavati /	Now, a few cases may be pointed out to contradict the above solution. When we say that a club-man is climbing up a mountain the club belonging to him also ascends the mountain. In the Vedic literature, too, the sentence that an assistant priest (Maitrā- varuņa) having a stick in his hand gives direction to his subordinate priests purports to convey that the said assistant priest should have a stick in his hand since the function of giving directions follows from the previous text.
yathā [lohitoṣṇīṣā ṛtvijaḥ pracaranti] iti śyenādau ṛtvijāṃ prakṛtivadbhāvena prāptānāṃ lohitoṣṇīṣavidhānamātram etat bhavati ucyate bhavatv evaṃ kintu daṇḍam avalambya puruṣaḥ parvatam ārohati na daṇḍo niścetanaḥ /	A review of the above criticism is as follows: Though there is much truth in the statement of the objector yet a man having a stick in his hand mounts the hill but the stick itself does not ascend it. The above Vedic sentence directs that a priest having a stick in his hand should give directions to his subordinates but not the stick itself should do it. Similarly, the other text does not direct that only the red turbans should roam about. Its direction is that the priests who have red turbans on their heads should only move.

If both the noun and the adjective had been the objects of knowledge then the corresponding knowledge would have been expressed in the proposition that there are a man and a stick but not in the proposition that there is a man having a stick.

The con- tention of the objector is not tenable since the net result of this determination is that the sole object of knowledge is only the noun.
daṇḍaḥ asya astīti puruṣa evocyate na daṇḍapuruṣau //	Hence, it signifies only a person but does not signify both a person and a stick.
evaṃ pūrvāparādipratyayāḥ cirakṣiprādipratyayāḥ iha tantuṣu paṭa ityādipratyayāś ca dikkālasamavāyagrāhiṇaḥ /	Thus, our knowledge of 'before' and 'after' etc. that of 'slow' and 'quick' etc. and the judgment that a cloth inheres in threads etc. refer to such objects as are qualified by space, time and the relation of inherence respectively.
na ime dikkālasamavāyāḥ sāmagryantargatās santaḥ pratyayātiśayam ādadhati na tadviṣayībhavanti paṭādidravyavat //	These factors viz., space, time and the relation of inherence are included in the conditions of knowledge and determine its distinctive character. But they are never cogniz- ed as a cloth is cognized.
evaṃ patanādyanumeyagurutvādikāraṇabhedajanitāḥ [guruḥ pāṣāṇaḥ] ityādipratyayāḥ parokṣaviśeṣaṇaṃ viśeṣyam avalambante ity alaṃ vistareṇa //	Thus, the judgment that a slab of stone is heavy refers to a substantive the predicate of which refers to a supersensible quality. This imperceptible quality which is an inference is one of the conditions of the judgment. It is inferred from its effect viz., the going down of the slab of stone.
tasmāt gaur ityādijñānaṃ na vācakāvacchinnavācyaviṣayam / ataś ca na śābdaṃ tat /	Hence, the judgment that this is a cow does not refer to an object as qualified by its name. Therefore, it is not a piece of verbal knowledge.
api tu suspaṣṭaṃ pratyakṣam eva /	But it is a clear case of perceptual judgment.
tasmiṃś ca lakṣye sati lakṣaṇavaiyarthyaśaṅkākaraṇābhāvāt nāsaṃbhavadoṣanirākaraṇārtham avyapadeśyapadam //	The judgments of this type come within the province of perception, so the assertion of the futility of the definition of perception becomes baseless. Hence, the adjective 'avyapadelyam' has not been given in the sutra to meet the charge that it is impossible to define perception.
kim arthaṃ tarhīdam astu uktam ācāryaiḥ ubhayajajñānavyavacchedārtham iti //	What is the function of this adjective? We simply repeat 180On the insertion of the word Avyapadesyam the answer, given by the celebrated teachers of the Nyaya school that it has been given to exclude such knowledge as arises from the two distinct sources of knowledge within the field of perception.
nanu tad api pratyakṣam eveti anapohyam uktam /	The hypothesis that the experience of objects qualified by denotative words is perceptual has not as yet been conclusively proved.

Suppose, when an experienced teacher imparts instructions in nomenclature to a common *man with regard to objects in the following manner that this is a cow, this is a jack-fruit and so on, the denotation of a word is learnt only from the source of verbal testimony.
ata eva ca loko 'pi śābdatvam iha manyate / śabdoparacitāpūrvajñānātiśayatoṣitaḥ //	181 For this obvious reason, a man in the street takes this piece of knowledge as arising from the verbal testimony since he is satisfied with this instruction which contributes a new inform- ation to the stock of his existing knowledge.
tacchabdavācyatājñaptiḥ vinā saṃjñopadeśinaḥ / śabdān neti sa evātra saty apy akṣe prakarṣabhāk //	Though his sense-organ plays some part in the acquisition of this knowledge of signification yet he would not have known that this object is denoted by this word if he had not listened to the above instruction.

vyadhāyi tadvyavacchedaḥ na tu dharmopadeśinā // tasmāt ubhayajajñānavyavacchedārtham evedaṃ padam iti //	Hence, we arrive at the conclusion that the term under discussion is indispensable for the exclusion of such knowledge as owes its existence to the two distinct types of sources of knowledge.

If both the noun and the adjective had been the objects of knowledge then the corresponding knowledge would have been expressed in the proposition that there are a man and a stick but not in the proposition that there is a man having a stick. Now, the objector may contend that the knowledge should not be expressed in the proposition that has been pointed out by the critic since the relation of the qualifying to the qualified determines the form of knowledge.
nanu tatra śabdasmaraṇaṃ kāraṇaṃ na śabdaḥ /	Hence, it signifies only a person but does not signify both a person and a stick.

If this is their view then the judgment that this is a cow, meant for communicating the acquired signification, should be necessarily generated by the two distinct types of sources of knowledge since the judgment is produced by the sense-organ together with the memory of a sentence learnt by us.

Now, the question is. "Why do not you exclude such a judgment from the field of perception by the term in question?" Now, they may contend that words do not directly condition the above judgment but their memory.
evam astv iti cet śāntam evaṃ sati tapasvinām /	Such a contention is not tenable.
yatra mārgāntareṇāpi saṅketajñānasaṃbhavaḥ /	The memory of words does also condition the know- ledge of signification.
tatrāpy anena nyāyena śābdatā na nivartate //	If it, were not recalled in mind then we could not know that such an object is denoted by such a word.
naiyāyikānāṃ ca savikalpapratyakṣamayāḥ prāṇāḥ /	The Naiyâyikas firmly stick to the hypothesis that the vali- dity of determinate perception is the life blood of their Episte- mology.
tasmān nobhayajasya śābdatvaṃ jñānasya vaktavyam //	Hence, the knowledge which owes its existence to the two distinct types of sources of knowledge should not be desig- nated as a piece of knowledge derived from the verbal testi- mony.
sambandhādhigamas tu nānāpramāṇakaḥ / tatra sve sve viṣaye tat tat pramāṇaṃ pravartate /	The relation of signification subsisting between a word and the object signified is grasped by means of various proofs. Each of them plays its own independent part.
yathā ''ha bhaṭṭaḥ [sambandhaḥ tripramāṇakaḥ] iti /	Similarly, when in order to communicate our acquired know- ledge we frame the judgment that this is so and so, we perceive the object as before.
tasmān naikasya śabdasya bhāraḥ āropaṇīyaḥ / pratyakṣaṃ tu saṅketagrahaṇakāle 'pi svaviṣayagrāhakam iti nobhayajajñānavyavacchedapakṣo niravadyaḥ / tasmād varaṃ jarannaiyāyikakathitaśabdakarmatāpannajñānavyavacchedapakṣa iti sa evāśrīyatām /	Hence perception plays more important part in these two cases. In other words, the sense-organ consti- tutes the very canvas of this judgment whereas the verbal testi- mony supplies us with the mere embroidery. Hence, the tentative hypothesis that the term 'avyapadeśya' has been used to exclude such knowledge as is the joint product of the two distinct sources of knowledge is not without its defects (i.e., is not fair).
tatra tāvat karmaṇi kṛtye kṛte vyapadeśyaśabdo yathārthataro bhavati //	The import of this argument is that the judgment in question is perceptual.
nanu tatra coditaṃ na tādṛśaṃ jñānam apramāṇaṃ na pañcamaṃ pramāṇam iti satyam ayan tu teṣām āśayaḥ /	It is neither invalid nor a class of valid knowledge by itself, i.e., it is a fifth type of valid knowledge. In other words, it has neither head nor tail.
rūpādiviṣayagrahaṇābhimukhaṃ hi tad akṣajaṃ jñānaṃ pramāṇaṃ phalaṃ vocyate /	The knowledge-element, represents perception. It is generated by the sense-organ. If it illuminates its object aright then it is a piece of valid perce- ptual knowledge.

Thus, the word 'apprehension' plays the role of an object. Hence, in the capacity of a word, it is not at all, a piece of knowledge.

pratyakṣam eva tat jñānam indriyānvayavyatirekānuvidhāyitvāt avyapadeśyaṃ aśābdam ity arthaḥ //	This piece of knowledge is sense-perception since it is causally connected with the sense-organ and its causal connection is determined by the joint method of agreement and difference.

śabdānusmṛtijatve 'pi na śābdaṃ jñānam īdṛśam / śabdasmṛtiḥ sahāya syāt indriyasya pradīpavat //	This piece of knowledge is sense-perception since it is vivid, that it is not word-interpenetrated at the time of its appearance, is causally connected with the sense-organ and gets the sanction of the popular view.
nanv evaṃ savikalpasya pratyakṣatve prasādhite / nedānīṃ saṅgṛhītaṃ syāt pratyakṣaṃ nirvikalpakam //	Now, if the hypothesis that determinate perception is sense- perception is thus proved then a new difficulty is to be faced viz., indeterminate perception does not come within the pro- vince of perception.
yas tu śabdānuvedhe 'pi pratyakṣaṃ jñānam iṣyate / tatra tatsparśaśūnyasya tathātve kā vicāraṇā //	Now, a retort to this critical remark is as follows: If even some word-interpenetrated knowledge is proved to be sense-perception then there is no doubt that apprehension which is absolutely free from the association with words is sense-perception.
nirvikalpakavat tasmāt pratyakṣaṃ savikalpakam / samagrahīc ca tad idaṃ padenānena sūtrakṛt //	Hence, the author of the Nyāya-sūtra includes both indeter- minate and determinate perception within sense-perception by the term 'avyapadeśya'.

In summer when the sun shines scorching the forehead with its heat its rays obliquely strike on the surface of the sandy soil and are thrown back. The reflected rays assume the form of waves. They appear as an ocean. The appearance of the rays as an ocean is false since what is pre- sented to consciousness does not correspond to reality.
tat anena padena vyavacchidyate na tat pratyakṣam iti //	The erroneous sense-perception is excluded from the realm of true sense-perception by the adjec- tive 'non-erroneous'.
tatra nirvikalpakam api prathamanayanasannipātajaṃ jñānam udakasavikalpakajñānajanakaṃ udakagrāhyeva na yathā tathā tathāgatāḥ kathayanti /	The indeterminate perception (sensation) is such apprehension as follows in immediate succession the initial contact of the eyes with the object. It produces the deter- minate perception of water.
nirvikalpāvasthāyām avicārayata eva prathamonmīlitacakṣuṣo jhaṭiti salilapratibhāsāt //	In the stage of indetermination one does not judge but as soon as he opens186 his eyes for the first time water is presented to his consciousness as a shining object.

tasmāt savikalpakam avikalpakaṃ vā yat atasmiṃs tad iti jñānam utpadyate tat vyabhicāti / tac ceha vyāvartyam iti //	Hence, indeterminate or determinate perception which makes a wrong reference is erroneous. Such an erroneous sense-perception is to be excluded from the province of perception in question.
nanu marīciṣu jalajñānam avidyamānasalilāvabhāsitvāt anindriyārthasannikarṣajam /	The mistake of the rays of the sun for water refers to an absent water. Hence, it is not produced by the sense-object-contact.
ataś cendriyārthasannikarṣotpannapadena tadvyudāsasiddheḥ kim avyabhicāripadena naitad evam tasyendriyārthajanyatvaṃ siddhaṃ tadbhāvabhāvataḥ /	Thus, the exclusion of errors from sense-perception being established, what is the use of the adjective 'non-erroneous'? Such an objection does not hold good. The illusion in question is produced by the sense-object- contact since it depends upon the sense-object-contact for its appearance.

But the rays of the sun do not give rise to the doubtful knowledge that they are either the rays or the waves like the well-known instance of doubt that it is either a post or a man.

kartṛkaraṇavyatiriktaṃ jñānajanakam ālambanam ucyata iti na paramāṇvādau prasaktir iti /	An alambana is such a condition of apprehension as is other than the agent and the instrument. Therefore, a supersensible object like an atom is never an alambana.

Hence, such illusions cannot be excluded from the province of true sense-perception if we simply qualify the true sense-perception by the adjective phrase 'generated by the sense-object-contact'. If it is a fact that subjective hallucinations arise independently of the external sense-organs, they are pre- cluded from the true sense-perception by the above phrase 'generated by the sense-object-contact'.

nanu evaṃprāyeṣu nirālambaneṣu vibhrameṣu kutastyaḥ ākāraḥ pratibhāti ucyate ākāraḥ smṛtyupārūḍhaḥ prāyeṇa sphurati bhrame /	Now a question arises in our mind, viz., "How does an object- less hallucination reveal a form ?" i.e., "How does it refer to an object ?" Our answer to this question is as follows:Nyayamanjari doubt from the true sense-perception.
smṛtes tu kāraṇaṃ kiñcit kadācit bhavati kvacit //	The term 'determinate' being superfluous, should not be used to preclude it.
kvacin nidrā kvacic cintā dhātūnāṃ vikṛtiḥ kvacit / alakṣyamāṇe tad dhetau adṛṣṭaṃ smṛtikāraṇam //	Such an objection is not tenable. A doubt is essentially diffe- rent from an error. Moreover, their causes are definitely dis- tinct.
bālasyendudvayajñānam asti nāstīti vetti kaḥ / astitve 'pi smṛtau hetum adṛṣṭaṃ tasya manvate //	An error is a piece of determinate knowledge which reveals an object wrongly. If we either mistake a pole for a man or we mistake a man for a pole then the predicate is the wrong one.
nūnaṃ niyamasiddhyarthaṃ janakasyāvabhāsanam / na caikāntāsato dṛṣṭā jñānotpādanayogyatā //	But the nature of doubt is defined as a piece of un- certain knowledge revealing a subject as predicated of two or more irreconcilable predicates at the same time.
na ca sannihitaṃ vastu tatrāsti vanitādikam / tenedaṃ smṛtyupārūḍhaṃ avabhātīti manvate //	In other words, when we doubt, our mind oscillates between the two contradictory or contrary predicates of one and the same subject and fails to arrive at a decision.
tatrādyena padenaitāḥ svāntaḥkaraṇasaṃbhavāḥ /	But when we err, we have a definite knowledge.
akṣajās tad vyudāsāya sūtre padam idaṃ kṛtam //	A definite predicate is asserted of the subject.
atas tad vyavacchedāya vyavasāyātmakagrahaṇam //	Thus the certainty and the uncertainty of know- ledge constitute their essential difference.
maivam sthāṇvādisaṃśayasya bāhyendriyānvayavyatirekānuvidhāyitvāt /	Error is conditioned by the remem- brance of a property which does not belong to the object in front of us.

Our sense-organ which is in contact with the object and is accompanied by the recollection of the property produces a judgment of sense-error that the object has the property (which is really supplied by memory).
ekarūpaṃ ca puro 'vasthitam arthaṃ anekarūpatayā spṛśati saṃśayaḥ [sthāṇur vā puruṣo vā] iti /	The person who remembers silverness at the time of the contact of the mother-of-pearl with his eyes or recollects water-ness at the time of the contact of the rays of the sun with his eyes has illusory experience.
naitad evam svarūpabhedāt kāraṇabhedāc ca /	But doubt is conditioned by the recollection of the two specific properties, the perception of general outline of an object etc.

so 'yaṃ svarūpabhedaḥ pratyātmasaṃvedyaḥ //	Thus, a doubt is a class by itself.

If we subscribe to the view of the band of the great logicians viz., 'Pravaras' then the term 'avyapadeśya' is competent 190The sense of the word Non-erroneous enough to exclude doubt and error from the range of true sense perception since it is impossible to hold that doubt and error are indeterminate.
puro 'vasthitasthāṇvādidharmidarśanamātram eva nirvikalpakam indriyavyāpārajam /	The sensation (i.e., the indeterminate per- ception of the object before us such as a pole etc.) owes its existence to the function of our sense-organ.
anantaran tu ubhayāntaraviśeṣaṇasmaraṇajanmanor ullikhitaśabdayor eva saṃśayaviparyayayor utpādaḥ /	But in the case of a doubt or an error it is immediately followed either by the remembrance of the one predicate or by that of the two such predicates. An error or a doubt arises from the one or from the other intermediate inner phenomenon.

ataḥ padadvayam api tadvyudāsāya na kartavyam //	The adjectives 'non-erroneous' and 'determinate should not be given to exclude them (error and doubt) from the domain of true sense-perception.
atraitad eva tāvad vaktavyam /	We have got something to say in this connection.
pravarapakṣaḥ pratikṣipta eva yataḥ śabdānuvedhajātam api pratyakṣam upapāditam //	We have already refuted the hypothesis of the Pravaras since we have established that the objects associated with their names are revealed by perception.

etac cānvayavyatirekābhyām avagamyate nimīlitacakṣuṣas tadanupādāt /	After the cessation of the operation of the sense-organ an error or a doubt appears.
na ca tadānīm antaḥsaṅkalparūpeṇāpi śabdollekhaḥ /	The sense-object-contact is never the im- mediate antecedent of either of them.
utpanne tu saṃśaye viparyaye ca vācakasmaraṇaṃ bhaviṣyatīti samyagjñānavat saṃśayaviparyayāv api śabdollekhaśūnyau saṃvedyete /	Therefore, the initial adjective phrase 'generated by the sense-object-contact' is com- petent enough to preclude error and doubt from the province of true sense-perception.
sā ca na tāvad utpanneti //	Such a contention is not tenable.
samyakpratyayavat tasmāt vācakollekhavarjitau /	The recollection of the predicates refers only to them.
akṣavyāpārajau na staḥ na saṃśayaviparyayau //	The recollection of the denotative terms as an essential factor of an error or a doubt has not been proved.
īdṛśayoḥ katham anayor ādyapadavyudasanīyatā tasmāt / tad apākṛtaye yuktaṃ padadvayasyāpy upādānam //	Now, how is the initial adjective phrase compe- tent to exclude such error and doubt from the realm of true sense-perception? Hence, it is highly reasonable to qualify true sense-perception by the above two adjectives viz., 'non- erroneous' and 'determinate' so that doubt and error are excluded from the province of true sense-perception.
evaṃ lakṣaṇapadāni /	Thus we have explained all the terms that constitute the exact defini- tion.
lakṣyapadaṃ tu [pratyakṣam] iti jñānaviśeṣe rūḍhyaiva pravartate yogasya vyabhicārāt /	But the term 'Pratyakşa' embodied in the definition stands for the object to be defined. It conveys a conventional sense and signifies also a particular species of knowledge.
pratigatam akṣaṃ pratyakṣam ity akṣarārthaḥ /	The compound word 'pratyakṣa' is derived from the original words 'akşam' and 'pratigatah'.
sa cāyaṃ sukhādāv api saṃbhavatīti rūḍhir eva sādhīyasī //	Such a meaning of the term may apply as well to pleasure etc. Hence, the conventional sense is more appropriate in this case.
atha vā jñānapadasya sūtre nirdeśāt yogapakṣo 'py astu /	Another alternative suggestion is that it should stick to the etymological sense since the word 'jñāna' (consciousness) has been definitely mentioned in the sutra.
na cāsau dṛśyamāno nihnotuṃ yuktaḥ /	The original sense of a word if it is clear, should not be sacrificed.
yogarūḍhis tu nāma na sammataiva viduṣām /	The scholars do not approve of such a meaning as is both etymological and (yoga-rudha) conventional (rudha).
yatrāpi hi dvayaṃ dṛśyate tatrāpi śabdapravṛttau prayojakam eva bhavati //	If it is admitted that a word has two kinds of meanings, etymolo- gical and conventional, then it will also be held that it does not simultaneously convey both the meanings but only helps the selection of its meaning.
kathaṃ punaḥ akṣaṃ pratigataṃ jñānam iṣyate na saṃyogitvena añjanādeḥ pratyakṣaprasaṅgāt /	Now, one should rationally explain "How is some form of consciousness dependent uponThe Buddhists' definition of determinate perception the sense-organ ?" If it is held that the term 'pratyakşa' applies to those objects which are attached to the sense-organ then it should apply as well to "stye' and such other objects.
na samavāyitvena akṣavartināṃ rūpādīnāṃ tathātvaprasaṅgāt / na janakatvena akṣāraṃbhakāṇāṃ paramāṇūnām api tathābhāvaprasakteḥ /	Again if it denotes such objects as inhere in the sense-organ then it should denote as well colour and such attributes that inhere in the sense-organ. Moreover, if it denotes the consti- tuents of the sense-organ then it should denote as well atoms etc.
tasmāt janyatvenaiva jñānam akṣaṃ pratigatam iti vyākhyeyam //	Hence, we should hold that it applies to such consciousness as is generated by the sense-organ.
avyayībhāvavyākhyānaṃ tu na yuktam pratyakṣaḥ puruṣaḥ pratyakṣā strī ityādivyavahāradarśanāt ity alam atiprasaṅgena //	The term 'pratyakşa' is not an example of the class of 'avyayibhava' compound (the resultant form of this compound word becomes an indeclinable word) because the word 'pratyakşa' takes the masculine form when it qualifies a noun in the masculine gender and it takes the feminine form when it qualifies a noun in the feminine gender.
tenendriyārthajatvādiviśeṣaṇagaṇānvitam / yato bhavati vijñānaṃ tat pratyakṣam iti sthitam //	193 Hence, true sense-perception is such consciousness as is qualified by the given adjective phrase and adjectives e.g. 'generated by the sense-object-contact' etc.
iti vigatakalaṅkam asya dhīmān akuruta lakṣaṇam etad akṣapādaḥ / na tu pararacitāni lakṣaṇāni kṣaṇam api sūkṣmadṛśāṃ viśānti cetaḥ //	Aksapãda, the highly intelligent logician, has framed a defectless definition of sense-perception whereas the definitions of perception, given by the rival schools, do not satisfy the mind of the critical thinkers.

Their causal connection is not determined by the joint method of agreement and diffe- rence.

yadi ca indriyārthasannikarṣaḥ tajjanako bhavet prathamam eva tathāvidhāṃ dhiyaṃ janayet na ca janayati /	The Buddhists also subscribe to the view that if the sense-object-contact fails to produce it at an early stage then it will not also generate it after the appearance of the memory of the scene.

In that case, the memory of name stands between the sense-object-contact and the determinate perception and separates the one from the other.
akṣadhīr yady apekṣeta so 'rtho vyavahito bhavet //] iti //	In that case, the object should be separated from its determinate perception.
saṅketasmaraṇasahakārisavyapekṣam akṣam īdṛśīṃ buddhiṃ janayatīti cet na vyatiriktāvyatiriktopakārādivikalpaiḥ sahakāriṇo nirastatvāt /	The contention of the Naiyāyikas is based upon an assumption that the cause, accom- panied by the accessory condition, produces its effect. Such an assumption is unwarranted. It is shattered by the horns of a dilemma that the benefit which the cause derives from the accessory condition is identical with the cause itself or not.
kiñca daṇḍītyādivikalpavijñānaṃ nendriyāpātavelāyām eva jāyate kintu bahuprakriyāpekṣam /	Moreover, the judgments of determinate perception such as "This is a man with a club' etc. do not immediately follow from the sense-object-contact. But they presuppose many an intermediate process.
yad āha [viśeṣaṇaṃ viśeṣyaṃ ca saṃbandhaṃ laukikīṃ sthitim / gṛhītvā sakalaṃ caitat tathā pratyeti nānyathā //] iti //	The Buddhists state clearly:-If one knows the qualifier, the qualified, their mutual relation, their actual order and all such prerequisite conditions then and then only he has the determinate perception of an object.

It is a fact that some cases of determinate perception contain the forms of real objects and are very vivid like an indeterminate perception.

(1) judgment having a universal as its content, (2) a judgment having an attribute as its content, (3) a judgment having an action as its content, (4) a judgment having a word as its content and 196A The Buddhists' definition of determinate perception (5) a judgment having a substance as its content.
tāś ca kvacid abhede 'pi bhedakalpanāt kvacic ca bhede 'py abhedakalpanāt kalpanā ucyante //	They are called imaginative judgments as they sometimes superimpose difference on a single unit or as they sometimes superimpose identity on the two different objects.

But a difference is imagined to exist between them. A substance which possesses an attribute and an attribute are never separately experienced. But it is strange that one intends to thrust difference upon them.
bhedāropaṇarūpaiva guṇavat karmakalpanā / tat svarūpātiriktā hi na kriyā nāma kācana //	The judgment involving an action is also a case of thrusting difference on a single unit like the previous one. An action is never distinct from the substance.

The illustration of the judgment invol ving a substance is that this is a club-man. The club, being a predicate of 'this', there is perfect co-ordination between 'this' and 'club'.

A reply to this ques- tion is as follows. If a real object appears to us to be another198 then a sublative judgment arises in our mind to negate it.
vyaktiviṣayā evaite sāmānyādivikalpāḥ /	But in the case of imaginative judgments universals and other such objects are not real.
tasmād vastvantarān avabhāsiṣv eṣu na bādhakaḥ pratyayo jāyate /	Hence, no sublative judgment has an occasion to arise in order to con- tradict an imaginary judgment which does not mistake one real object for another.

na caite pramāṇam etad ullikhyamānasya jātyāder apāramārthikatvāt / ata eva pramāṇaviparyayābhyām ayam anya eva vikalpa ity ācakṣata ity alaṃ vistareṇa //	But they are not true because univer- sals and such other objects which are revealed by them are un- real. Therefore, the Buddhists hold that these judgments are neither real nor unreal but are a class by themselves. There is no need of further discussion.
evam etāḥ pravartante vāsanāmātranirmitāḥ / kalpitālīkabhedādiprapañcāḥ pañcakalpanāḥ //	Thus these five types of judgments are creatures of imagina- tion. They also reveal a world of unreal imaginary objects like difference etc.

(2) Or, is it in- valid because it does not arise from the sense-object-contact, being dependent upon the remembrance of signification for its coming into being? (3) Or, is it invalid because it depends upon many troublesome complicated processes for its appear- ance? (4) Or, is it invalid because it is dissimilar to the initial indeterminate perception which lacks representative characterThe Buddhists' definition of perception refuted and because it judges? (5) Or, is it invalid because it appre- hends an object already apprehended? We may clarify our point and say that a determinate perception grasps an object which has been sensed by its antecedent indeterminate percep- tion.

The Buddhists should not hold that a determinate perception does not arise from the sense-object-contact because it depends upon the remembrance of a word which is presented to consciousness when the relation of a word to its denotation is grasped.

But we cannot follow. the true implication of this charge viz. the eclipse of an object.
rūpasmṛtyākhyasamanantarapratyayanirmitasya nirvikalpasya rūpajñānasyāpi tathātvaprasaṅgāt //	The remembrance of the name of an object is one of the conditions of perception like the internal organ. As such it plays its part to bring about its perception.
yac cedam ucyate [so 'rtho vyavahito bhavet] iti tan na vidmaḥ kīdṛśaṃ vyavadhānam arthasyeti /	How should it conceal an object from our sight? The Buddhists may contend that a word (i.e. the name of an object) which is recalled in memory obstructs the illumination of the object in question.
na hi dīpena vā manasā vā vijñānahetunā kadācid artho vyavadhīyate /	A word like an act of consciousness or like a lamp reveals an object but does never throw an object into the shade.

But such an attempt to save their skin is really hoping against hope since the doctrine of universal flux will be refuted later on. (The Buddhists advocate the pragmatic test of truth. The object of a perception is never reached.
na cendriyavyāpāratirodhānaṃ vyavadhānam tasyādhunāpy anuvartamānatvāt // yathā tadbhāvabhāvitvād ādyaṃ vijñānam akṣajam /	We perceive an individual hut we never get it if we move towards it since it is transient. They hold that the pragmatic test will be satisfied if an indivi- dual of the series which the object of perception belongs to is reached).

We shall simply follow the practice of the Buddhists and hold that the object which is grasped by a determinate perception is the same as is sensed by the preceding indeterminate percep- tion though these two objects are not numerically identical yet they are the same in the sense that they belong to one and the202 same series.
api ca pradarśitaprāptyādivyavahāravatsantānadvārakam ihāpi tadgrahaṇaṃ bhaviṣyatīti sarvathā na vyavadhānam /	The Buddhists have also done something when they hold that a person gets the same object as is rightly appre- hended by him. Thus, the suggestion of obstruction is absolutely untenable.

How is it that it is not a case of sense-perception? It has been stated that a determinate perception is not true because it presupposes troublesome complicated processes such as the perception of the subject, the awareness of the predicate and so on. Such a statement of reasons is a very cheap way of criticism. It is not a fact that a judgment is wrong because one undergoes a lot of trouble to frame it.
uktaṃ ca [na hi giriśṛṅgam āruhya yad gṛhyate tad apratyakṣam] iti /	It has been rightly remarked that the perception of a person is not wrong if he perceives, climbing up a mountain.

It has been stated that a judgment of perception is invalid because it is qualitatively different from an indeterminate perception which contains no element of recognition and because it judges. But this argument is not sound. An awareness does never judge.
vicārako hi pramātā /	It is a knower who alone judges.
sa hi praśyati smarati anusandhatte vicārayati icchati dveṣṭi yatate gṛhṇāti jahāti sukham anubhavatīti vakṣyāmaḥ /	We shall bring home the point that it is the subject who sees, remembers, recognizes, judges, longs for an object, hates it, strives for it, catches hold of it, gives it up and enjoys pleasure derived from it.

The Buddhists may contend that even if it is assumed that a determinate perception grasps such an object as has been apprehended by an indeterminate perception then as an in- determinate perception alone apprehends an object in its en- tirety, a determinate perception is invalid because it knows what is already known.
na hy adhigatādhigantṛtvaṃ prāmāṇyam ity uktam /	We have mentioned in this connection that novelty does not constitute the criterion of true knowledge.

The judgments, the products of imagination, superimpose identity on the different objects and difference on the identical objects and are therefore false as they mistake one thing for another. The falsehood of an awareness consists in mistaking one thing for another.
tasya hi bādhakapratyayopasannipātān niścayaḥ /	A determinate perception is not a case of mistake because a mistake is detected when it is contradict- ed.
na ca bhavadupavarṇitāsu pañcasv api jātyādikalpanāsu bādhakaṃ kiñcid astīti nātasmiṃs tadgrāhiṇyaḥ kalpanā bhavanti //	But we find no such judgments as contradict the five kinds of imaginative judgments which have universals etc. as their contents and which have been described by the Buddhists. Hence they do not illustrate mistaking one thing for another.
jātir jātimato bhinnā guṇī guṇagaṇāt pṛthak / tathaiva tat pratīteś ca kalpanoktir abādhikā //	A substance, the possessor of an attribute, is not identical with a host of attributes. An individual and a universal, a substance and an attribute etc. are so perceived as they are in reality.

The judgment that this is Devadatta does not import that 'this' is the same as the name Devadatta'. The Buddhists cannot hold that the name 'Devadatta' is wrongly thought of as the object Devadatta i.e.
na śabdavivartarūpeṇārthaḥ parisphurati /	It is not a case of ascription of identity.
kiṃ tarhi śabdasmṛtyākhyasāmagryasāmarthyātiśayodbhavaḥ /	What is the true import of this judgment? It is a distinct judgment ! It has a special condition viz. the remembrance of a name.

daṇḍy ayam iti dravyābhedakalpanā tu mandamatibhir evodāhṛtā /	The judgment that this is a club-man i.e. a man with a club signifies that this is identical with a club.
na hi daṇḍo 'yam iti devadatte pratītiḥ api tu daṇḍīti /	The judgment that this is a club does not point to Devadatta but the judgment that this is a club- man' does it.
tatra ca prakṛtipratyayau pṛthag evopalabhyete daṇḍo 'syāstīti daṇḍīti /	In the term 'dandin' the basic word 'danda' and the nominal suffix 'in' are distinctly presented to our conscious- ness. The term 'daṇḍin' signifies one who has a 'daṇḍa' (stick).
tad iha yathaiva vastu tathaiva tadavasāya iti nābhedāropaḥ //	The objects which stand related in reality are presented to our con- sciousness as such.
karmaṇi tu dvayam api nāsti nābhinne bhedakalpanā na ca bhinne 'py abhedakalpanā //	The act of imagination does not discharge the two-fold function viz. (i) it does neither ascribe identity to two different objects nor (ii) it does create imaginary diffe- rence in a single unit.
kriyā hi tadvato bhinnā bhedenaiva ca gṛhyate /	An action is really different from a substance in action.

tena kriyāguṇadravyanāmajātyuparañjitam / viṣayaṃ darśayan neti vikalpo nāpramāṇatām //	When we see an object move we know the true nature of an action. Hence a determinate perception which apprehends an object as qualified by an action, an attribute, a substance, a designa- tion and a universal is not untrue.
viparyayāt samuttīrṇa iti sādhu sahāmahe / pramāṇāt tu bahirbhūtaṃ vikalpaṃ na kṣamāmahe //	We, the Naiyayikas, gladly subscribe to this part of the hypo- thesis that it is not illusory but on the contrary, we record our emphatic denial to the other part of the hypothesis that no determinate perception is true.
kvacid bādhakayogena yadi tasyāpramāṇatā / nirvikalpe 'pi tulyā 'sau dvicandrādyavabhāsini //	If the Buddhists hold that all determinate perception is false because a few cases of determinate perception are contradicted then the Naiyayikas as well make a counter proposal that all indeterminate perception is false because the double vision of the moon, an example of indeterminate perception, is false.
manorājyavikalpānāṃ kāmam astv apramāṇatā /	Let the examples of determinate perception which refers to imaginary objects be false.

The Buddhists may contend that the fact of succession of an indeterminate perception will furnish it with the required form. A memory-image sometimes follows an indeterminate perception in immediate succession. But the memory-image does not bear a resemblance to that of an indeterminate perception.

bhavanto nirvikalpasya viṣayaṃ saṃpracakṣate / sajātīyavijātīyaparāvṛttaṃ svalakṣaṇam //	The Buddhists hold that the object of an indeterminate per- ception is an exclusively particular point of reality which is distinct from all homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.
mahāsāmānyam anye tu sattāṃ tad viṣayaṃ viduḥ /	Some other thinkers assert that the object of an indeter- minate perception is the summum genus of all existent objects viz.
vāgrūpam apare tattvaṃ prameyaṃ tasya manvate // kecid guṇakriyādravyajātibhedādirūṣitam /	Some other thinkers hold that a real substance is variously qualified by an attribute, an action, a substance, a universal and the properties and accidens and it is apprehended by an indeterminate 'perception'.
śabalaṃ vastu manyante nirvikalpakagocaram // pratyakṣaviṣaye 'py etāḥ citraṃ vipratipattayaḥ / parokṣārthe hi vimatiḥ pratyakṣeṇopaśāmyati /	It is a wonder of wonders that there are so many conflicting hypothesis with regard to the very object of perception. But this perception is the highest court of appeal to settle the dispute of the conflicting theories centering round a transcenden- tal object.
pratyakṣe hi samutpannā vimatiḥ kena śāmyati idaṃ bhāti na bhātīti saṃvidvipratipattiṣu / parapratyāyane puṃsāṃ śaraṇaṃ śapathoktayaḥ //	But how is it possible to settle the dispute over the contradictory evidences of perception viz. 'this is perceived' and "this is not perceived'? In order to convince others of his hypo- thesis a person has recourse only to others.

tatra na tāvat sakalasajātīyavyāvṛttaṃ svalakṣaṇaṃ pratyakṣasya viṣayaḥ // gṛhīte nirvikalpena vyāvṛtte hi svalakṣaṇe /	The Buddhist hypothesis that an indeterminate perception apprehends an exclusively particular point of reality which is distinct from all sorts of homogeneous and heterogeneous objects, is not tenable.
akasmād eva sāmānyavikalpollasanaṃ katham // nirvikalpānusāreṇa hi vikalpāḥ prādurbhavitum arhanti / api ca vijātīyaparāvṛttaviṣayā yadi kalpanā /	206 If an exclusively particular point of reality is the object of an indeterminate perception then how can a judgment of im- agination, its immediate successor, having a universal as its content all of a sudden come into being ? A determinate perception should imitate the form of an in- determinate perception.
vyāvṛttān nanu naivānyā vyāvṛttiḥ paramārthataḥ /	(The Naiyāyikas suggest that there is no qualitative difference between a determinate and an indeterminate perception.

If the genus of existence is the sole object of an indeterminate perception then the doctrine of monism with all its implications is established.

nāvidyāmātram evedam iti ca sthāpayiṣyate // vāktattvapratibhāso 'pi pratikṣipto 'nayā diśā /	The hypothesis that the sole object of an indeterminate per- -ception is a word which is the only underlying reality is similarly confuted by us (the Naiyāyikas).
kathaṃ ca cākṣuśe jñāne vāktattvam avabhāsate //	How do we visualize a word? How is a word (i.e.

If the hypothesis that a substratum is qualified by a variety of inherent properties such as a universal, etc., catches popular fancy then let us give our consent to it.
tadātmatā tu naikasya nityaṃ tattvānupragrahāt / aṃśaniṣkarṣapakṣe tu dharmabhedo balād bhavet //	A substratum of various properties, etc., is not identical with its properties and accidens since they are not cognized being constantly present in it.

(If the mode of a sense-organ or of the intellect is the proof and if the awareness of an object is the result determined by the proof then there is no co-ordination between the proof and the result. The result belongs to the soul, the proof belongs either to a sense-organ or the intellect.) The Mimāṁsakas' definition of perception refuted Perception is that form of consciousness which arises from the contact of the sense-organs with the existent real object in the mind of a person.
na ca kṣaṇikavādimate bādhyabādhakabhāvo buddhīnām upapadyata ity alaṃ vimardena //	As it throws light only on the existent percep- tible objects it does not reveal 'Dharma'.
iti sunipuṇabuddhir lakṣaṇaṃ vaktukāmaḥ padayugalam apīdaṃ nirmame nānavadyam /	For this reason the sutra which deals with perception has been interpreted by the followers of Jaimini that it is not a direct definition of percep- tion.
bhavatu matimahim naś ceṣṭitam etat jagadabhibhavadhīraṃ dhīmato dharmakīrteḥ //	They hold that the initial proposition of Jaimini is the definition of Dharma Dharma has been defined as the end of human life which has been revealed only by the Vedic injunc- tions.
api tu dharmaṃ prati pratyakṣam animittaṃ evaṃ lakṣaṇakatvād iti anuvādabhaṅgyā lakṣaṇe yojitam /	Though the definition of perception has no direct bear- ing upon the initial proposition, i.e., upon Dharma yet it has been given to indicate that perception has nothing to do with the illumination of Dharma.
yathoktam[evaṃ saty anuvādatvaṃ lakṣaṇasyāpi saṃbhavet] iti / tad etallakṣaṇavarṇane sūtrayojanam asamīcīnam ativyāptidoṣānativṛtteḥ /	If the interpreters insist on the point that the above sútra embodies the definition of perception then they act unwisely since the so-called definition does not escape the defect of being too wide.
tathā hi indriyāṇāṃ sati saṃprayoge puruṣasya jāhamānā buddhiḥ pratyakṣam iti sūtrārthaḥ /	The boiled-down meaning of the sūtra amounts to this that when the sense-organs come in contact with the existent objects, an awareness which arises in the mind of a person is called perception.
tathā cātivyāptiḥ saṃśayaviparyayabuddhyor api indriyasaṃyogajarvena pratyakṣatvaprasaṅgāt //	This definition of perception is as well applicable to the cases of doubt and illusion since they are also due to the sense-object-contact.

The compound word 'sat-samprayoga', they add, may be analysed into its components in a different manner.
yathāktam [samyagarthe ca saṃśabdo duṣprayoganivāraṇaḥ /	The indeclinable prefix 'sam' in the 'sampra- yoga' indicates such a sense-object contact as excludes doubt and illusion.

kāryaṃ ca jñānam /	The effect of the sense-object- contact is an apprehension.
na ca tad aviśeṣitam eva prayogasya samyaktām avagamayati /	But if it is not adequately qualified, it does not indicate the appropriateness of the sense-object- contact.
na ca tadviśeṣaṇaparam iha padam api akṣaram api mātrām api vā sūtre paśyāmaḥ /	There is neither a single word nor a letter nor the slightest ,indication found in the sûtra to qualify the resulting conscious- ness.
saṭāṃ samprayoga iti ca padaṃ nirālambanajñānanivṛttaye varṇitam /	The object of the compound word signifying the contact of the sense-organ with the real object has been narrated as to exclude hallucination from the field of perception.

If this be their con- tention then the critics may as well hold that there is no necessity of taking the pains of stretching the sutra to such an extent as to show its competence to embody the definition of perception since the people, innocent of the definition of perception as given by the systems of logic, know perception as an accomplished fact.
yadviṣayaṃ jñānaṃ tenaiva saṃprayoge indriyāṇāṃ puruṣasya buddhijanma sat pratyakṣam / yat anyaviṣayakaṃ jñānam anyasaṃprayoge bhavati na tat pratyakṣam iti] tad api vṛthā 'ṭāṭyāmātran saṃśayajñānena vyabhicārānativṛtteḥ /	He states that perceptual consciousness which does not corre-Nyayamanjari spond to its object is illusory. He also adds that if our sense-organ does not come in contact with such an object as is referred to by the true perception then the true perception does not dawn. He simply makes a reciprocal change of place of the words 'sat' and 'tat' in the sutra and transforms it into a defectless one, i.e., an ideal one.
tatra hi yadviṣayakaṃ jñānaṃ tena saṃprayoga indriyāṇām asty eva //	According to him the apprehension of an object is a true perception if it arises from the contact of a sense-organ with the object apprehended by it.
nanu ubhayaviṣayakaṃ jñānam na cobhābhyāṃ saṃprayuktam indriyam maivam na hi dhavakhadiravat dvāv api saṃśayasaṃvidi pratibhāsete / kiṃ tu sthāṇur vā puruṣo veti anirdhāritaikatarapadārthatattvāvamarśī saṃśayo jāyate /	Unlike a copulative judgment which refers to the two independent objects standing side by side unrelated lika 'Dhava' and 'Khadira' (two trees belonging to different species) a doubt does not refer definitely to the two objects. A doubt is an inde- finite state of knowledge which oscillates between the two alter- natives. The well-known illustration of doubt is that this is post or a man.
nūnaṃ ca tayor anyatareṇendriyaṃ saṃprayuktam eveti / ubhavāv abhavaty eveti nātivyāptiḥ parihṛtā bhavati //	But it is, of course, a truism that the sense- organ must have come in contact with one of the two objects. But it is also a fact that the two objects have been alternatively referred to by it.
atha brūyuḥ kim anena parikleśena na lakṣaṇavarṇanam asmākam abhimatam anuvādapakṣanikṣiptatvāt /	Now the Mimāṁsakas may give a new turn to the contention and say that there is no need of taking so much trouble in criticizing them since they do not intend to define perception since the definition of perception has been assumed at first and it will be an idle job to repent it.

Perception is not a source of knowledge of Dharma because it apprehends only an existent object.
dharmaś ca na vartamānaḥ trikālānavacchinnasya tasya [yajeta] [dadyāt] [juhuyāt] ityādiśabdebhyaḥ pratīteḥ //	Dharma is not an existent fact because it is not an event in time, being conveyed by verbs such as 'should worship' 'should give' 'should offer libation' etc.

yadi vidyamānopalaṃbhanatvam asiddham iti paro brūyāt sa vaktavyaḥ vidyamānopalaṃbhanaṃ pratyakṣaṃ satsaṃprayogajatvād iti //	If a critic takes an exception to the conclusion that perception is only a source of knowledge of an existent object then a reply is given to him that perception reveals only an existent object since it arises from the contact of the sense-organ with an existent object.
pratyakṣagrahaṇam api hetunirdeśārtham eva /	The sūtra represents perception with the definite object of embodying the above reason for its inability to apprehend Dharma.

It has been stated in the Śloka-vārttika that the very essence of perception con- sists in its being produced by the real sense-object-contact and that remaining conclusions follow from it.

Or, does transcendental perception of the stages reveal Dharma? But we all agree to the point that normal perception does not reveal Dharma. Why does he take so much pains to prove an agreed thesis? But as he does not subscribe to the thesis that transcendental perception of the sages is a fact so why does he try to prove 213Nyāyamanjari that transcendental perception does not reveal Dharma? If transcendental perception is a fiction as Kumārila believes then there will be no minor term, i.e., the subject of inference will be absent.

If they accept the first alternative then they will also hold that transcendental perception is real since what is logical in one system is also the same in the other systems as logic partiality.

atas tadanubhāṣaṇe dharmagrāhakaṃ na dharmagrāhakam ity uktaṃ syāt //	If the Mimāṁsakas assume it in toto and subsequently state that transcendental perception which is an illuminator of Dharma is a non-illuminator of Dharma then they flatly contradict themselves.

So, if we are not ourselves sure of the subject of inference, but are in possession of a second-hand knowledge from the rival school, we should not proceed to make an inference.
prasaṅgaś ca nāma parasiddhena parasyāniṣṭāpādanam ucyate / parasya ca vidyamānopalaṃbhanaṃ satsaṃprayogajanyaṃ ca prtyakṣaṃ siddham /	The Mimāṁsakas may contend that it is an admitted method of destructive criticism, i.c., reductio ad absurdum. This method consists in assuming the conclusion of a rival party in examin- ing it and in drawing an absurd conclusion from it.

Is there any defect in this procedure? No, this is not so.

It is not sound to discuss whether the sky-flower is fragrant or not.

Who knows that nobody's per- ception reveals Dharma ? You cannot know that I do not perceive Dharma. I cannot know that you do not perceive Dharma. Both you and I cannot know that he does not perceive Dharma like us.

He accepts the challenge and enquires about the positive proof in favour of transcendental perception which apprehends Dharma. A reply to this question is as follows: The compe- tence of this perception lies in its superior quality.
unduruvairiṇas tu sāndratamatamaḥpaṅkapaṭalaviliptadeśapatitam api saṃpaśyanti /	We only perceive the near objects with our eyes when we receive assis- tance from light. The cats (the enemies of mice) perceive objects situated on a spot enveloped by pitchy darkness.
saṃpātināmā ca gṛdhrājo yojanaśatavyavahitām api daśarathanandanasuncarīṃ dadatśeti śrūyate rāmāyaṇe /	It is learnt from the Rāmāyaṇa that the king of Vultures, Sampāti by name, saw the daughter-in-law of Daśaratha (Sītā) from a dis- tance of a hundred yojanas (a yojana-4 miles roughly).
so 'yaṃ darśanātiśayaḥ śuklādiguṇātiśaya iva tāratamyasamanvita iti gamayati param api niratiśayam atiśayam /	The superior quality of perception varies in degrees like the superior quality of the colour 'white', etc. The truth also remains implicit in the above statement that when the quality or perception varies in degrees a section of the class attains the highest degree of perfection.
ataś ca yatrāsya paraḥ prakarṣaḥ te yogino gīyante /	Those whose perception reaches the highest degree of perfection are called 'sage'.
darśanasya ca paro 'tiśayaḥ sūkṣmavyavahitaviprakṛṣṭabhūtabhaviṣyadādiviṣayatvam //	The most excellent perfection of perception is constituted by the apprehension of subtle, separated from the field of vision by partition, remote, past and future objects.
nanu svaviṣayānatikrameṇa bhavatu tadatiśayaklpanā /	The Mīmāṁsakas argue against the above hypo- thesis thus Though perception reaches the climax of perfec- tion yet it cannot violate the law which governs the nature of its objects.
dharmas tu cakṣuṣo na viṣaya eva /	Dharma is not at all a perceptible object.

The above examples, cited by us, show that a very distant object (an object lying at a distance of a hundredCognition of transcendental perception yojanas) and an object covered by darkness, are beyond the Teach of our normal eyes but still are respectively sensed by Sampāti and a cat. A natural reaction to this sort of reply is that if a sage perceives a transcendental object then he should also perceive odour, taste, etc., with his eyes.
yathoktam [ekena tu pramāṇena sarvajño yena kalpyate / nūnaṃ sa cakṣuṣā sarvān rasādīn pratipadyate] iti //	If one imagines that an omniscient sage grasps every object of the universe by means of a single source of knowledge then he should admit that the sage perceives taste, etc., with his eyes.
na etad evam rasādigrāhīṇy api yoginām indriyāṇi cakṣurvad atiśayavanty eveti rasādiṣu cakṣurvyāpāraḥ parikalpyate /	The other sense-organs of the sages are endowed with super-excellent powers like the eyes. Hence, the fantastic hypothesis that a sage perceives taste, etc., with eyes is not to be conjectured.

The Mimāṁsaka Teplies that an object is known to be not fit for perception when it is not perceived with eyes though it is present before the eyes. Let us take the example of sound. It is not perceived with eyes though it enters the field of vision. (An answer to the above question is only suggested that Dharma is transcen- -dental.) The Naiyayika reviews Kumärila's arguments and points out that the latter cannot say from his experience that a sage, though endowed with super-eyes, cannot perceive Dharma be- cause Dharma and the excellent power of the eyes of a sage are imperceptible to him.
nanu kartavyatārūpaḥ trikālasparśavarjitaḥ /	Past, present and future do not put a limit to it.
cakṣurviṣayatām eti dharma ity atisāhasam //127// satyaṃ sāhasam etat te mama vā carmacakṣuṣaḥ /	Is it not a rash act to hold that 217218 Dharma is perceived with eyes? Surely, it will be rash on our part to hold that it is perceived with the mortal eyes of you and me.

But. this argument is not based upon the observation of facts but only upon the technicality of the Mimämsä system.

Is it an act of rashness to draw a conclusion like this? If the Mimāṁsakas find fault with the external sense-organs and cannot admit of the excellence of them then we (the Naiyāyikas) do not insist on the acceptance of the- former hypothesis put forward by us, viz., the sages perceive- Dharma with their supernormal eyes.
manaḥkaraṇakaṃ jñānaṃ bhavanābhyāsasaṃbhavam / bhavati dhyāyatāṃ dharme kāntādāv iva kāminām //129//	When a sage meditates on Dharma and practises constant contemplation upon it he intuits Dharma with his internal organ like a love-sick person who beholds his beloved lady by means of meditation alone.
mano hi sarvaviṣayaṃ na tasyāviṣayaḥ kaścid asti /	The reason behind such intuition is that the internal organ is competent to comprehend all objects without an exception and there is no such object in the universe as defies its pene.. tration.
abhyāsavaśāc cātīndriyeṣv apy artheṣu parisphuṭāḥ pratibhāsāḥ prādurbhavanto dṛśyante /	We have also got a lot of examples to show that men, practising meditation upon objects which are beyond the reach of sense-organs, have clear and vivid vision of them.

The Mīmārsakas may contend that the above examples illu- strate false knowledge and it is not fair to establish the true transcendental perception of the sages after their analogy.
na hi śabdaghaṭayor api sarvātmanā 'tulyatvam /	When we say that a sound is like a jar we do not mean that they resemble each other on all points.
tatra kāmaśokādibhāvanābhyāsabhuvāṃ pratibhāsānāṃ bādhakavaidhuryādaprāmāṇyaṃ bhaviṣyati netareṣām tadabhāvāt /	The clear and vivid vision of imaginary objects springs up from the constant practice of contemplation upon them. Again this habit of contemplation is determined by lust, excessive grief, etc.

He who practises the act of jumping (high or long) everyday with undivided attention, springs up or forward only a few steps more, i.e., makes a very little progress in his act but does neither jump over the mountain nor the ocean. A rejoinder to this objection is as follows.
mā gāt prakarṣaṃ jñāne tu tasya kaḥ pratibandhakaḥ //131//	But our knowledge reaches the highest summit because there is no obstacle to its upward journey.
laṅghanādau tu pūrvedyuḥ prayatnasamupārjitaḥ / na dehe 'tiśayaḥ kaścid anyedyur avatiṣṭhate //132//	The state of excellence laboriously acquired by the body on the previous day, is not retained by it on the following day.
tatra kevalam abhyāsāt praksaye kaphamedasoḥ /	But by mere practice phlegm and fat are considerably reduced.

Or, as gold, being slowly purified in a closed vessel, acquires matchless beauty, so the inner organ of a sage is capable of perceiving all knowable objects by the constant practice of meditation.
asmadādeś ca rāgādimalāvaraṇadhūsaram / mano na labhate jñānaprakarṣapadavīṃ parām //138//	On the other hand, the inner organ of worldly men like our- selves being enveloped by the veil of passions we do not acquire the highest stage of knowledge, i.e., omniscience.
pratyahaṃ bhāvanābhyāsakṣapitāśeṣakalmaṣan / yogināṃ tu manaḥ śuddhaṃ kāmivārthaṃ na pasyati //139//	Is there any -object which is not directly grasped by the pure inner organ of the sages? The reason of this direct awareness lies in the fact that all the impurities of their mind are consumed by the daily practice of meditation.
yathā ca teṣāṃ rāgādiprahāṇam avakalpate / tathā 'pavargacintāyāṃ vistarenābhidhāsyate //140//	The method of cleansing the impurities of the inner organ such as worldly attachment, etc., will be elaborately discussed in the chapter on Apavarga (Final eman- cipation).
tad evaṃ kṣīṇadoṣāṇāṃ dhyānāvahitacetasām / nirmalaṃ sarvaviṣayaṃ jñānaṃ bhavati yoginām //141//	Thus, when the sages consume all the inner drosses and acquire high proficiency in the art of concentration by the constant practice of meditation, they attain to faultless omni- science.

Do the critics call it a true judgment ? If the critics point out that the correspondence of the judg- ment in question to facts is purely accidental then it is replied that the plea of accidental correspondence does not hold good since the real object has been truly revealed beforehand.Statement of Intuitive Knowledge An argument against the validity of this piece of knowledge is this that it is not generated by an object since the brother who is the object referred to is absent at that time.
syād etad evaṃ yadi tadā 'stitvena bhrātaraṃ gṛhṇīyāt /	Certainly, this argument would have held good if he had known his brother as present on that occasion.
bhāvitvaṃ ca tadā 'syāsty eveti kathaṃ anarthajaṃ tajjñānam //	But he knows him as a possible event in future. This idea of possibility, too, is an event of the present time.
bhāvitvaṃ hi nāma sāvadhiḥ prāgabhāvaḥ /	The brother under consideration is present as a possible object which is perceived.
abhāvasys ca bhāvena bhrātrā saha kaḥ sambandhaḥ vastvavastunor virodhāt tad etad asamyak taddeśasambandhasya tatra prāgabhāvaḥ na tu dharmiṇaḥ /	It is really the pre-negation of an object which is limited in time. How can a negative fact be related to a positive object? Because, they are incompatible with each other by their very nature.
sa hi vidyata eva prāgavagataḥ /	This pre-negation is not incompatible with the person.
sa ca kutaścit bhojanotkaṇṭhādeḥ kāraṇāt smaraṇapadavīm upārūḍhaḥ śvastanāgamanaviśiṣṭatvena pratibhātīti prātibhasya sa eva janaka iti /	He is recalled in our memory because he is anxiously expected at the time of dinner. The brother who is thus recollected is presented to our consciousness in the form that he will come here tomorrow. The brother in question is one of the conditions of prophetic vision (pratibhā-jñāna).
tasmād anarthajatvābhāvāt pramāṇaṃ pratibham /	Hence, this type of knowledge which is not hallucinatory but is conditioned by a real object is really valid.
pramāṇaṃ ca sat pratyakṣam eva na pramāaṇāntaram śabdaliṅgasārūpyanimittānapekṣatvāt //	It belongs to none of them since it does not depend upon a word, a mark and resem- blance for its appearance. It may be objected that it cannot be direct since it is non-sensuous.
nanu pratyakṣam api mā bhūt indriyānapekṣatvāt maivam manasa eva tatrendriyatvāt /	Such an objection is not ten- able since the inner organ determines it.
pūrvotpannacākṣuṣavijñānaviśeṣaṇasya bāhyasya vastuno mano grāhakam iti nāndhādyabhāva ity uktam /	Such an objection has been met before. It has been answered that the external object which has been perceived with eyes is only intuited by the inner organ.
śabdādyupāyāntaraviratau ca jāyamānam anavadyaṃ jñānaṃ mānasaṃ pratyakṣaṃ bhavati /	It has also been stated 221-222 Nyāyamanjari before that a piece of knowledge which is true but comes into being on the absence of the acknowledged conditions of know- ledge such as a word etc.

The implication of the previous line is that it is not perceptual.
[ṛṣīṇām api yaj jñānaṃ tad apy āgamapūrvakam] iti hi vadanti /	The -answer to the above charge is that the transcendental knowledge of a sage is always perceptual.
anupāyasya jñānasya teṣām asattvāt //	If it is not direct it is not the knowledge of a sage.

All the sources of the knowledge of a sage have not been exhaustively given but have only been illustrated by means of a single instance.
nanu pratyakṣam api nedaṃ bhavati taddhi vartamānaikaviṣayam / yathoktam [saṃbaddhaṃ vartamānaṃ ca gṛhyate cakṣurādinā] iti /	No such knowledge arises in the mind of a sage as does not spring up from a source. Now, another objection arises in our mind that foresight is non-perceptual since perception refers only to a present object.
tathā [eṣa pratyaksadharmaś ca vartamānārthataiva yat] iti ca /	Moreover, it should also be noted that the differentia of perception is that it apprehends a present object.
maivamanāgatagrāhiṇaḥ pratyakṣasya pradeśāntare svayam evoktatvāt //	The objectors themselves have been stated in another place that an object with its future property is apprehended.
[rajataṃ gṛhyamāṇaṃ hi cirasthāyīti gṛhyate] iti ca bhavānevāvocat /	When silver is perceived it is also perceived that it will last long.
tasmāt pratyakṣam anāgatagrāhi [śvo me bhrātā ''gantā] iti siddham //	In fine, it is also established that the perception that my brother will come to-morrow reveals a future object.
evañ cāsmadādīnām ivānāgate bhrātari yogināṃ bhaviṣyati dharme pratyakṣaṃ pravartsyatīti /	As the perception of an ordinary man refers to a future object so the transcendental perception of the sage refers to future Dharma.
tasmāt yat sarvajñaniṣedhāya kathyate [yajjātīyakḥ pramāṇais tu yajjātīyārthadarśanam / bhaved idānīṃ lokasya tathā kālāntare 'py abhūt //	Thus, the argument against omniscience offered by Kumarila is refuted. Kumärila has stated that: As an ordinary person grasps a particular type of object by means of a particular kind of proof so a similar object was grasped by a similar proof in the past.
iti tad apāstaṃ bhavati //	Now, the following objections appear in our mind.
tatraitat syāt sarvajñatā yogināṃ kim ekena jñānena bahubhir vā na tāvad ekena na hy ekasmin jñāne parasparavirodhino 'rthāḥ śītoṣṇavad avabhāsante //	Is omni- science constituted by a single act of transcendental perception or by many acts of transcendental perception? The first alter-Statement of intuitive Knowledge native is not possible since the incompatible objects like heat -and cold are never present in a single act of consciousness, By many acts of consciousness all the objects of the world are not known.
nāpi bahubhiḥ tāni hi krameṇa vā bhaveyuḥ yugapad vā na yugapajjñānāni saṃbhavanti sūkṣmāntaḥkaraṇasāpekṣatvāt /	Do these acts of consciousness arise simultaneously or successively? They cannot simultaneously arise since the internal organ, the instrument of consciousness is so small that it cannot simultaneously produce many acts of consciousness.

A rejoinder to the objection is -as follows: The sages will simultaneously perceive all the objects all over the world by a single act of perception.

We may also cite instances which show that we simultaneously feel heat and cold on some occasions.

There is a clear-cut distinction between them and Him.

If the sages are pioneers to know the true nature of Dharma from the Vedas then the well-ascertained proposition that the Vedas are the only source of Dharma is never contradicted. This is the final argument of the objector. Our reply to the above objection is as follows: There is an element of truth in the above objection that the sages are ini- tiated into Dharma by the Vedas.
api ceśvarajñānaṃ sāṃsiddhikam eva dharmaviṣayaṃ vedasya kāraṇabhutaṃ vakṣyāmaḥ /	Moreover, the eternal perception of Dharma belonging to God is the source of Dharma. God is the author of the Vedas because of His per- ception.

There- fore, the argument offered by the Mimaṁsakas, against the possibility of the transcendental perception of Dharma by the sages, is not convincing.

The Vedas which are words do not signify novel Dharma. Dharma is grasped by some other means of proof. Thus the Vedas are not the only source of Dharma).

tad ittham api jaiminīyaṃ sūtram asaṅgatārtham /	Therefore, the sutra on perception, put forward by Jaimini thus interpreted, (i.c.
lakṣaṇaparatvaṃ tv asya nirastam eva //	meant for the refutation of transcendental perception) is really irrelevant.

They hold that the consciousness which arises from the contactSamkhya definition of Perception refuted 225 of the soul, the internal organ, the sense-organ and the object and which is other than inferential knowledge and such other indirect knowledge is called perception.
īśvarakṛṣṇasya [prativiṣayādhyavasāyo dṛṣṭam] iti pratyakṣalakṣaṇam avocat /	Samkhya definition of Perception refuted Iśvara Kṛṣṇa, on the other hand, has defined perception as a clear and distinct image of its corresponding object.

ghaṭo 'yam itivat agnimān parvata ity ābhimukhyenaiva pratīteḥ /	Like the perceptual judgment that this is a jar, the inferential judgment that this hill contains fire refers to an object which is cognized to be in front of the person concerned.

As a special rule restricts and narrows down the wide application of a general rule so the special images distinguish themselves from the parti- cular image.

alam ativistareṇa paradarśanagītamataḥ vigatakalaṅkam asti na hi lakṣaṇam akṣadhiya1.282.02 ḥ /	226 It is needless to speak much about it. For the reason indicated above the definitions of perception offered by the other systems are without defects.
tad alam akṣapādamuninaiva nibaddham idaṃ harati manāṃsi lakṣaṇam udāradhiyām //1501.282.04 //	So, the definition of perception, framed by Gautama, attracts the mind of high intellectual attainments.
tatpūrvakaṃ ca trividham anumānaṃ pūrvvac cheṣavat sāmānyato dṛṣṭaṃ ca //5//	Inference which is dependent on perception admits of three kinds, viz., (1) Pūrvavat, (2) Šeşavat and (3) Sāmānyato- dṛṣṭa (Nyāya-sūtra I, 5).
tadapekṣasvarūpayoḥ sapakṣavipakṣayor apy abhāvaḥ syāt /	If the knowledge of the thing signified is called a means then the judgment that the thing signified is acceptable, or avoidable, etc. will be the resultant form of inference.

Thus, the relation of concomi tance holding between the above two terms is established. Now, in the syllogism, "The body of luminous substance (a whole) is not-hot because it is a product" the atoms which constitute the body of luminous substance illustrate the contrary example. No thinker can mention such an absurd reason. It may be pointed out that the moon, the stars etc.
kin tu sandigdha evāste / yady evaṃ sandigdhe 'pi vipakṣe vartamāno dhūmādir ahetur eva syāt /	are constituted by luminous atoms but they are not hot. A thinker may frame a syllogism of which the product is the middle term and not-hot is the major term.
niścitavipakṣavṛttivat sandigdhavipakṣavṛtter api ahetutvāt sarvam anumānam utsīdet /	The major premise is based upon the tentative induction which must be verified in order to accept as universal induction. At the time of framing the premise no contrary example has come to his notice.

Now, the Buddhists contend that nothing really possesses the two mutually contrary characteristic features. If the subject of inference possesses the major term as its attribute then it really becomes a similar example.
sa tu na pakṣamātraparyavasito bādhaḥ kin tu hetum api spṛśati // nahetunirapekṣātmā pakṣo nāmāsti kiś cana /	If it does not possess it then how is it that it is not a contrary example. It cannot also be held either that the subject of inference alternately becomes a simi- lar example and contrary one or that it is neither a similar232 example nor a contrary one.
prasādhayitum iṣṭo hi hetunā pakṣa ucyate //159//	The import of this contention is that a neutral subject of inference is an absurdity.
sa na sādhayituṃ śakyaḥ pratyakṣe pratiyogini / sādhyāpahāradvāreṇa hetur bhavati bādhitaḥ //160//	But such a contention is not tenable since it strikes at the very root of in- ference and does away with it. It is a truism that a thing is not endowed with the two contrary characters.
abādhitānumeyatvam ata evāsya lakṣaṇam /	But it is in the nature of inference that an object should be exclusively selected as the subject of inference.
na tu hetur asiddho 'yaṃ jvalane vṛttisaṃbhavāt //161// yat tv abādhitatā jñātuṃ śakyā neti vikalpitam /	But the reason is faulty because it is not invariablyInference-its Definition 233 concomitant of the major term in question (i.c., the relation of invariable concomitance does not hold between the state of being product and the state of being not-hot (cold).
prayatne kriyamāṇe 'pi yadi bādhā na dṛśyate / nāsty evety avagantavyaṃ vyavahāro hi nānyathā //163//	But it is a truism what has been again pointed out by you that the reason does not belong to such a subject of inference as is not con- tradicted.
atas trilakṣaṇe 'pi hetau bādhasaṃbhavād abādhitatvaṃ rūpāntaraṃ vaktavyam //	But we also take a note of this criticism and hold that the predicate of the above subject of inference is contradict- ed by perception.

There is no such subject of inference as is absolutely indepen- dent of a reason since it is a reason by means of which some predicate is asserted of it (the subject of inference).
evam āgamabādhito 'pi hetur draṣṭavyaḥ /	(In other words, we establish the conclusion that a hill is fiery because it is smoky.
yathā brāhmaṇena surā peyā aduṣṭatvāt kṣīravad iti //	We prove that a hill, the subject of inference, con- tains fire because it has smoke (the reason).

ata evānumānaviruddham anumānam apaśyatā bhāṣyakāreṇoktam [yat punar anumānaṃ pratyakāgamaviruddhaṃ nyāyābhāsas saḥ] iti //	Thus, it should be admitted that one of the essential condi- tions of being a true reason is that it should be invariably con comitant with such a thing to be inferred (i.e., a major term) as is not contradicted in any locus of their compresence.
asatpratipakṣatvaṃ pañcamaṃ liṅgalakṣaṇam upadeśyate //	But the reason belongs to the subject of inference viz., fire.
ata eva viruddhāvyabhicārī nāma na hetvābhāsa iheṣyate /	Thus the condition of being a faulty reason, viz., its non-presence in the subject of inference, does not invalidate it.

If you make sincere attempts to find out contradiction but fail to do so then you should admit that there is no contradic- tion. But if you deny the truth of this maxim then all your practical transactions will be impeded by imaginary doubts.234 Nyāyamanjari The Buddhists hold that the sound reason has only three characteristic features.
anyataraviṣayānupalaṃbha evāyaṃ saṃśayādhāyī pakṣadharmānvayavyatirekopapattibhrameṇa hetur iti prayujyamānaḥ satpratyakṣo bhavatīti prakaraṇasamahetvābhāsacintāyāṃ vistareṇa nirūpayiṣyate /	But a reason, thus characterized, may fall a victim to another defect of being contradicted, viz., it may be imagined to be concomitant of a major term, the presence of which in the locus of a reason is contradicted by some other proof. Therefore, non-contradictoriness should be distinctly in- cluded in the list of the conditions which are essential for a sound reason.
puruṣaprajñāpraṃādamūlatvāc ca vastuno dvyātmakatvam iti tatraiva vakṣyate // lakṣaṇāntaramataḥ kathanīyam pratyanekavikalatavam avaśyam /	The Buddhists hold that contradictoriness and invariable concomitance are mutually incompatible with regard to a reason which is marked by the three characteristic features mentioned by them (the Buddhists).
tena liṅgim anumānapathajñāḥ pañcalakṣaṇakam abhyupajagmuḥ //163//	This incompatibility is not universal.

In other words, contradictoriness and invariable concomitance are compresent in some reasons, marked by the above three characteristic features. But invariable con- comitance which belongs to a reason, marked by the five characteristic features, reaches the ideal state of perfection since such a reason excludes contradictoriness.
vyāptigrahaṇakālagṛhītam eva vyāptivat smaryamāṇatayaiva liṅgaṃ liṅginiṃ gamayiṣyatīti cen na grahaṇam antareṇa vyāptismṛter apy abhāvāt ity alaṃ prasaṅgena //	In case of a reason, marked only by the three characteristic features, the hypothesis of incompatibility is not logically tenable. Thus, it has been stated that the hypothesis is partially tenable and partially untenable. Enough of this discussion.
niyamasmṛter iti vivriyatāṃ ko 'yaṃ niyamo nāma vyāptiḥ avinābhāvaḥ nityasāhacaryam ity arthaḥ //	What is this niyama? It is the real relation of invariable concomitance holding between the middle term (the probans) and the major term (the proban- dum).
āha naitāvaty eva virantum ucitam /	It is also called an indissoluble connexion between ob- jects or ideas.
tasya tadavinābhāvitvam ity atra hi nimittam anveṣaṇīyaṃ tārkikaiḥ // tac ca tādātmyatadutpattirūpam īkṣitavanto bhikṣavaḥ /	It is also designated as their constant comprese- The Buddhists hold that the laws of identity and causa- lity constitute the ground of indissoluble connexion between ideas or objects. The Naiyãyikas demand a further explanation on this point.
yo hi yadātmā bhāvaḥ sa kathaṃ tam utsṛjati vṛkṣātmikaiva hi śiṃśapā tena vṛkṣatvam anumāpayati /	How can it be different from that? A šimšapā (an individual belonging to a species of tree) is a tree. So a šimšapā constitutes the probans for the probandum that it is a tree.
so 'yaṃ svabhāvahetur ucyate vṛkṣo 'yaṃ śiṃśapātvāt iti /	This probans is based upon identity. This is a tree because this is a simśapā. (This judg- ment is analytic).
tatra tādātmyaṃ pratibandhaḥ //	Thus the indissoluble connexion between these two ideas is based upon the law of identity (this law is really appriori in character as it is not discovered after observ- ing facts, but by the action of our thought a creation of our imaginative mind).
kārthaṃ nāma kāraṇādhīnātmalābham eva bhavati na kāraṇānapekṣam iti /	What is an effect is absolutely dependent upon its cause for its very existence but is never independent of it.
tadupalabhyamānaṃ tadanumāpayati agnir atra dhūmāt iti kāryahetau tadutpattiḥ pratibandhaḥ /	When an effect is cognized it leads to the inferential knowledge of its cause. It may be illustrated thus:--Here is fire because here is smoke.
evaṃ hi dvividhaṃ pratibandham anumeyāvyabhichāranibandhanam anuktvā kevalasāhacaryaniyamamātravarṇanaṃ yat pādaprasārikā saiveti // ucyate pādaprasārikaiva sādhīyasī sthūladṛṣṭibhir avalambitā varaṃ na sūkṣmadṛṣṭibhiḥ utprekṣitāḥ tādātmyādipratibandhāḥ //	The Buddhists hold that the Naiyāyikas exhibit an attribute of escapism when they state the mere rule of invariable concomi- tance but not the ground of two-fold indissoluble connexion. The Refutation of the Buddhist Hypothesis A reply to the above objections is given thus :-We prefer the crude hypothesis of the rule of invariable concomitance offered by the persons of obtruse intellect-the hypothesis which has been stigmatized as the walking on foot to the laws of identity and causality-the grounds of the knowledge of invariable concomi- tance as devised by the men of sharp intellect.
tādātmye tāvadgamakāṅgehetusādhyayor avyatireke gamyagamakabhāva eva durupapādaḥ /	If the law of identity is the ground of invariable concomitance, the middle term becomes identical with the major term.
na khalv agṛhītaṃ liṅgaṃ liṅgipratītim ādhātum arhati /	(If we do not see smoke in a hill, we cannot know that fire exists in that hill.

If the mark i.e., the middle term, is apprehended then do we236 apprehend the thing marked (i.e., the major term) along with it or not? If the thing marked and the mark are not simul- taneously apprehended then how is it that the mark is identical with the thing marked? If they are simultaneously present to our consciousness then the thing marked is perceived like the mark.

But in the Buddhist example of svabhāva anumāna the simśapă tree is identical with a tree. Hence, when we determine a śimśapā tree as a simŝapă tree we can- not attribute an attribute which is contrary to the essence of a tree to it. Moreover, in the above case, we determine a śímśapā tree as a tree.
pramātuḥ śiṃśapātvaṃ hi yasya pratyakṣagocaraḥ /	We have definite knowledge of its generic chara- cter.

But if we have definite knowledge of the specific character of an individual then we cannot commit a blunder as to its generic character i.e., if we definitely know an individual as belonging to the species to śimšapā then we can- not take it for a non-tree.
tathā ca prayatnānantarīyakatvenānityatvaṃ sādyate tadvad anityatvenāpi tatsādhyeta /	Similarly, as the conclusion that it is non-eternal follows from the premise that it is an immediate successor of effort and that the premise that it is an immediate successor follows from the premise that it is non- eternal.

nanu ca anyaḥ saṃbandhaḥ anyaś ca pratibandhaḥ / dviṣṭhaḥ sambandhaḥ pratibandhas tu parāyattatvalakṣaṇaḥ /	A relation belongs to both the terms, i.e., the relata. On the other hand, the relation of invariable concomitance implies the dependence of one term upon another.
tatra śiṃśapātvaṃ vṛkṣatve pratibaddham na vṛkṣatvaṃ śiṃśapātve /	The essence of a simśapā is an invariable concomitant of the essence of a tree but the latter is not an invariable concomitant of the former.
prayatnānantarīyakatvam api anityatve niyatam na tv anityatvaṃ tatreti /	Similarly, successiveness to an effort is an invariable concomi- tant of non-eternality but not the vice-versa.
tathā dhūmasyāgnau pratibandhaḥ na tv agner dhūme /	Smoke is the invariable concomitant of fire but not the vice-versa.
satyam evam kin tv evam ucyamāne niyama evāṅgīkṛto bhavet na tādātmyam /	It amounts to mere concomitance based upon the empirical law but not to invariable concomitance based upon the law of identity.

But when we see a catechu tree we see a tree but not a simšapā. When we see lightning we know it to be short- lived, i.e. non-eternal but do not know that its non-eternality immediately succeeds an effort. How does the relation of identity hold between the above two pairs ? Several examples may be cited to demonstrate that the reason is absent but the consequence is seen to be present.
dṛṣṭas tadvyatirekeṇa tadātmā ceti kaitavam //165//	If238 Nyāyamanjari the one exists without the other, but they are held to be iden- tical then such a statement is deceitful.

Thus, there is no common property which is shared by all. Hence the relation of invariable concomitance which is asserted to be shared by many indivi- duals cannot be possible.
dhūmāgnyos tu kāryakāraṇayor bhedāt yuktaṃ vaktum dhūmasyāgnau pratibandhaḥ na tv agner dhūme /	But fire, being the cause of smoke, it is reasonable to hold that smoke is the invariable concomitant of fire but not vice-versa, since smoke is different from fire.
iha tu sādhyasādhanayor avyatirekāt na tathā śakyate vaktum /	Hence in the above case, the identity of the reason with the consequence cannot be maintained.

yaś cāyaṃ anityaḥ śabdaḥ kṛtakatvād iti svabhāvahetur udāhṛtaḥ sa kathaṃ svabhāvahetuḥ idaṃ hi cintyatām /	In order to illustrate an inference based upon iden- tity the Buddhists cite the following example, viz., sound s non-eternal because it is a product.
anityatvaṃ nāma kim ucyate kiṃ ca kṛtakatvam iti /	The meaning of the term 'non-eternality' is 'mect- ing destruction'.
tatrānityatvaṃ vināśayogaḥ utpattiyogaś ca kṛtakatvam /	The meaning of the term 'the character of being a product' is 'having a new beginning'. An ob ect which comes into existence meets its destruction.

eṣya ca sā mithyā buddhiḥ śikhariṇa iva kṛśānuviśeṣitasya vināśavataḥ śabdasya gṛhītum aśakyatvāt //	Such a conclusion is surely false since it is difficult for us to comprehend the con- clusion that sound is destructible as we do in case of the conclusion that the hill is fiery.

Now, if the word 'non-eternal' has a negative meaning then how is it that it has a positive essence, because a positive essence is incompatible with the negative real? Thus, the word 'anityatva' denotes real existence marked by the two terminations (ends).
kṛtakatvam api sattaiva kāraṇotpāditā dhārā satī kathyate iti /	The word 'krtakatva' (the character of being a product) denotes existence which belongs to a real object, being brought about by its cause.
evañ ca sattaiva sādhyaṃ sādhanaṃ ceti siddhaṃ svabhāvahetutvam //	Thus, the reason is existence and the conse- quence is existence. Hence, it is an instance of inference based upon the law of identity.

sādhyasādhanayos tathātvenānavabhāsanāt / evaṃ hy ucyamāne śabdaḥ sattāvān sattāvattvād iti pratītaḥ syāt /	On the other hand, the current syllogistic form is that sound is non-eternal because it is a product. The object to be inferred is such existence which inheres in a real object which is brought about by its cause.

Now, the Buddhists may hold that destruction is one of the boundary lines of existence, though actually absent, is supplied by our imagination.
buddhisthenātha tenāsyāḥ paricchedo 'bhyupeyate / śabdasyaiva paricchedo vināśenāstu tādṛśā //167//	If this is their answer then the Naiyāyikas will also hold that destruction, though actually absent, may qualify sound, being supplied by our imagination.
tadviśeṣaṇatāṃ yāti tathā bhāvy 'pi yāsyati //168//	As a present predicate is asserted of a subject so a future predicate may be asserted of a subject in the same manner.

Hence, there is no point in subscribing to the con- jecture that existence is to be inferred. The Buddhists have taken exception to the attachment of a suffix which denotes an abstract quality to a negative term.
śabdapravṛttinimittasya tatra bhāvapratyayenābhidhānāt tasya guṇasya hi bhāvāt dravye tacchabdaniveśa iti /	Those suffixes denote the essence of the mean- ing of the words which they are attached to (i.e. their essential property). They are attached to words which denote positive reals because these reals possess the uncommon property.
abhāve 'pi abhāvatvam iti darśanāt /	In other words, a negative real has also some unique property.
tasmāt buddhisthavināśayoga evānityatvam //	Hence, the word 'anityatva' denotes the abstract property of a destructible object which may be comprehended.
kṛtakatvam apy utpattiyoga eva na sattā / kāraṇotpāditāśrayāvacchede tu tasyā iṣyamāṇe dharmina eva tadavacchedo bhavatv iti kiṃ sopānāntareṇa //	The word 'krtakatva' denotes the abstract property of an effect which is produced but not exis- tence (unconditional). But the Buddhists may contend that it should denote such existence as belongs to an object which has been brought about by its cause.

yad ghaṭe nāsti tacchabde yac ca śabde na tadghaṭe //139//	The peculiar property which belongs to a jar does not belong to sound andRefutation of an Inference based upon the law of identity what belongs to sound does not belong to a jar (the same reason should belong to the subject of inference and to the example).

naitadevam dharmibhede 'pi dharmāṇāṃ tulyarūpāṇāṃ avabhāsāt // na ghaṭādisvarūpaṃ hi nāśa ity avakalpate /	The Buddhist thesis is not sound, Because though the different subjects have distinct properties yet they are presented our consciousness as the same.
yenānanvayadoṣaḥ syāt tadbhedopanibandhanaḥ //171//	The reason behind our point of view is that the destruction of a jar is not the jar itself.
ekatvam api dharmasya nāsti sarveṣu dharmiṣu / yenaikadhvaṃsasamaye sakaladhvaṃsasaṅkaraḥ //172//	241 Moreover, a single common property, viz., destruction, does not belong to all objects of the universe.
bhinnatve 'pi ca dharmāṇaṃ samānarūpatvenāvabhāsamānatvāt anvayagrahaṇādikāryāvirodhaḥ /	The net result of this apprehension is that there is no hind- rance to our inference since there is perfect harmony between the reason belonging to the subject and that belonging to the example. Though the attributes are distinct yet they are presented to our consciousness to be the same.
ata eva sāmānyam antareṇāpi samānadharmamūlānvayādivyavahāropapatteḥ tatra na sūtrakāreṇa sāmānyagrahaṇaṃ kṛtakam /	Hence, there is no difficulty in the formulation of a general proposition i.e., the major premise based upon induction. Thus the relation of concomi- tance obtains between the middle and major terms.
api tu sādharmyagrahaṇam upāttam [udāharaṇasādharmyāt sādhyasādhanaṃ hetuḥ] [sādhyasādharmyāt datdharmabhāvī dṛṣṭānta udāharaṇam] iti /	The reason proves what is to be established through its similarity with the example. The proposition which contains the reason is called 'hetu'. The example has the characteristics of the subject because of its similarity with it.
tena vināsotpādadharmayoḥ sādhyasādhanabhāvāt tayoś ca bhedāt anityaḥ śabdaḥ kṛtakatvād iti na svabhāvahetur iti siddham //	Therefore, the syllogism which contains origin and destruc- tion as its middle and major terms does not illustrate an inference based upon the law of identity since the middle term is distinct from the major term.
kāryahetur api saṃbhavati /	Similarly, an effect cannot be the reason by means of which an inference is made.
bhavatāṃ hi pakṣo kṣaṇayor vā kāryakāraṇabhāvo bhavet santānayor vā kṣaṇayor neti vakṣyāmaḥ kṣaṇabhaṅganirākṛtau /	Does the relation of cause and effect take place between the two momentary objects or between the two series of momentary objects? When the doctrine of the universal flux will be refuted we shall point out that the relation of cause and effect does not take place between the two instantaneous objects.
saṃbhavann Pi durlakṣaḥ sūkṣmatvāc ca tayor asau //173//	If such a relation at all takes place between them, it is very difficult to comprehend because of the subtle character of them.
dhūmāgnisantānayos tu avāstavatvād eva nāsti kāryakāraṇabhāvaḥ /	The two series of smoke and fire have merely imaginary existence and hence the causal relation does not subsist between them.

yadi dhūmaḥ kāryatād analam anumāpayet kaṭumalinagaganagāmitvādidharmair api tasya gamako bhavet /	If inference is from smoke, the effect to fire, the cause, smoke, having the characteristic features such as bad odour, dark colour, ascending the sky, etc.

atha sarvātmanā 'pi tatkāryatve dhūmatvamātram evāgnisahacārīti gamyase /	Now, if it is established that smoke with all its attributes is the effect of fire then the Buddhists may revise their thesis and hold that smoke, which is not specified by its peculiar attributes but is marked only by its class-character and is concomitant with fire, leads to an inference of fire.
sahacāritvam evāstu tadutpattikathā vṛthā //174// nanu bhavadbhir api kāryānumānam aṅgīkṛtam eva /	If this be the case, the Buddhists vainly make mention of the reason as an effect but should only speak about its concomitance.

He holds that inference is either from effect to cause, or from cause to effect, or from one term conjoined to the other correlative term, or from the one form inherent to the other correlative term, or from the negative term to its positive correlative term.
dhūmāgnyor nadīpūrayor vā na kāryakāraṇabhāvāt gamakatvaṃ yathoktanyāyena api tu nityasāhacaryān niyamād eveti //	We infer fire from smoke and rain-fall from the swelling of the river-current not because of their causal connexion but because of their invari- able concomitance.

A positive term and a negative one are related to each other as ground and consequence. If we find the presence of one of them, we infer the absence of the other.
bhāvābhāvayoś ca sāhacaryaṃ tayor asty eva /	Thus the relation of invariable concomitance subsists between them, i.e., the pair of the two opposite terms.

anye 'pi saugatodgītapratibandhadvayojjhitāḥ //178// kiyanto bata gaṇyante hetavaḥ sādhyabodhakāḥ /	Thus we see that there are various reasons which constitute the sound basis for inference but invariable concomitance is not based upon the laws of identity and causality.

(Of course, the answer of both the schools will be the same, viz., observation). Nothing can be gained by this unfruitful ramble.

The primary meaning of the word 'linga' (mark or reason) is to be sacrificed. The secondary meaning of it is to be accepted.

Suppose, if we try to establish that fire belongs to some particular place, say, a hill, then the well-known reason does not belong to it (the subject of inference). Because specified smoke which plays the part of a reason does not belong to the minor term. (Smoke the origin of which is linked up with fire is the true reason).
nityaparokṣasyāpi ceśvarādṛṣṭendriyāder anumeyatāṃ vakṣyāmaḥ // tasmād yathocitāl liṅgāt yathoktaniyamasmṛteḥ /	If the hill is to be inferred then the relation of invariable concomitance does not subsist between the hill and smoke thus specified. Because we cannot genera.

nanu saty anumanasya prāmāṇye lakṣaṇāśrayaḥ / kāryo vicāraḥ na punaḥ prāmāṇyaṃ tasya yujyate //188//	Again, if it is held that both the hill and fire are to be inferred then smoke, the reason, neither belongs to the minor term nor is the invari- able concomitant of the major term.

Again, if the hill as containing fire is to be inferred then the above reason does neither belong to the subject of inference nor is, invariably, concomitant of the major term.
na hi dahanamahīdhrayoḥ dhūmo dharmaḥ // nāpy evam anvayaḥ yatra dhūmaḥ tatra parvatāgnī iti /	No body perceives that smoke belongs to the hill which contains fire. No body generalizes that where there is smoke there is a bill which contains fire.

Thus the relation of invariable concomitance is shown to subsist between pakṣa in the secondary sense and hetu (the reason). Thus, the definition of anumana (inference) turns out to have a secondary meaning like the definition of perception according to which perception is what arises from the sense- object-contact. Therefore, inference is not a source of valid knowledge.

If the Naiyayikas hold that the relation of invariable con- comitance is not confined within the realm of particulars but obtains between the two universals, we, the Cārvākas, take a strong exception to this view since a universal has no objective existence in the real universe.
bahukṛtvo 'pi vastvātmā tatheti pariniścitaḥ /	(Thus, the possibility of disco- vering the relation of invariable concomitance by means of the transcendental contact in the shape of a universal is ruled out).

Because in the face of the repeated observations of concomitance say, a thousand times, a tentatively accepted probans has every chance of not accom- panying the expected probandum.

But how do you arrive at the conclu- sion on the score of repeated observations that smoke does not exist in the locus where there is no fire? If we merely observe the concomitance of the two things in a particular place, we cannot infer the presence of one of them in another place from the perception of the presence of another.

Some other better logicians do not share in the view of the earlier ones but explain the same fact in a different manner.

This admission amounts to this that the sole target of objection is the definition of inference.

If it is answered (by the Buddhists) that the relation of invariable concomitance is based upon the laws of identity and causality then we point out that the question is not squarely solved but it persists as it was before.
jvalanāj jāyate dhūmaḥ na jalād iti kā gatiḥ /	Let them (the Buddhists) solve the problem, viz., why does smoke arise from fire but not from water? The only possible answer is that smoke and fire are so related because we learn their relation from experience.
evam evaitad iti cet sāhacarye 'pi tatsamam //217//	If this is the answer then the relation of invariable concomitance requires no laws besides experience as its basis.
tarkasya yāvān viṣayaḥ sa tāvati nirūpyate /	How do we know that the relation of invariable concomitance obtains between the two objects? The answer is because experience teaches us that they are so related.
vastusvabhāvabhede tu na tasya prabhaviṣṇutā //218//	The answer given by the Naiyāyikas is in no way different from that given by the Buddhists.

Again, a suggestion may come that an object points to another object because of its own inner essence but not because of the relation of invariable concomitance.

The enquiry regarding the basis of this relation will not be reasonable since the declared basis of this relation, viz., the law of identity and causality has been already discre- dited by sound logical arguments.
na caivam astīti niyamagrahaṇam apekṣaṇīyam //	It is not fair to hold that inferential knowledge is merely a judgment of imagination.
yac ca vikalpitaṃ aśakyaṃ tadgrahaṇam iti tatra kecid ācakṣate mānasaṃ pratyaksaṃ pratibandhagrāhīti /	Because, it has been stated that if an object is an invariable concomitant of another object then and then only the knowledge of the former leads to the knowledge of the latter.
pratyakṣānupalaṃbhābhyāṃ analasahacaritam agneś ca vyāvartamānaṃ dhūmam upalabhya vibhāv asau niyato dhūma iti manasā pratipadyate //	If the mere presence of the relation of invariable concomitance without being cognized had led to the knowledge of its invariable concomitant then the inhabitants of the island which bears a significant name 'nārikela' (the island which abounds in coconut-trees) would have inferred fire merely seeing smoke but not knowing its invariable relation to fire.

apare punaḥ yogipratyakṣakalpaṃ yauktikaṃ sambandhagrāhi pratyakṣaṃ pratipedire kila /	Therefore, the Naiyāyikas strongly assert that the knowledge of the relation of invariable concomitance definitely conditions inference.

But it should also be noted that in order to comprehend the rela- tion of invariable concomitance obtaining between smoke and fire it is not necessary that all the particulars belonging to the classes of smoke and fire should be perceived.

bhāvasāmānyayor yadvad tathaiva tadbhāvayoḥ //222// bhāvayoḥ sāhacaryaṃ yat anvayaṃ tat pracakṣate /	As we perceive the co-existence of smoke and fire and frame a universal judgment "Where there is smoke there is fire", on the basis of our perception, so we perceive the co-existence of the absence of fire and that of smoke.

The relation of universal concomitance holding between the two positive objects and between the two negative objects is de- tected by the internal organ.

If the definition is newly worded then the purity of know- ledge will not be affected. 259 The last charge brought against the validity of inference is that if a particular is the consequence then no reason is its concomitant and that if a universal is the consequence then an old story is only repeated (a known object is established).

Thus, the meaning of it will amount to this that inference is that of which the two acts of perception are the cause. Are any two perceptions the cause? No, any two perceptions are not the cause of inference but the two such acts are to be specified.

The pronoun 'tat' refers to it. How does the interpreter give the twisted meaning of it, viz., the two specific percep-262 tions? A reply to this objection is as follows: The definition of the reason to be given later on is this that the reason is that which proves the object to be established through its similarity with the example.

We are to move in a vicious circle if we have recourse to some source other than perception. We have very often drawn the attention of our critics to this point. Though the context supplies us with perception in general but not the particular perception which lies at the root of inference yet the pronoun 'tat' refers here to the particular perceptions, viz., the perception of the universal concomitance and the second perception of this reason.

In order to make this definition exact it is to be shown that it sharply distinguishes the species of inference from the other species such as comparison, etc, which are subsumed under the same genus of prama. The compound word 'tat-pūrvaka' which constitutes the definition does it nicely.

Two pieces of know- ledge do not arise simultaneously. Hence, the verbal and the inferential characters of a piece of knowledge cannot be simul- taneously recognised.

teṣv api mūlabhūtaṃ pratyakṣa eva kāraṇam iti kecid āhuḥ /	Some logicians meet this objection to this effect that perception is the basic foundation of this knowledge.
tāni pratyakṣādīni pūrvaṃ yasyeti / yady api pratyakṣam eva lakṣyatvena prastutam /	Kumärila has stated that when the reason itself, being inferred, proves the object to be established it is proved by another fundamental reason that is perceived.

How are the mediate forms of knowledge denoted by the pronoun tat'? It can only refer to perception since it only precedes the sutra on inference.
yad uktaṃ pratyutpannakāraṇajanyā smṛtir anumānam iti tatra spaṣṭam eva sāmānādhikaraṇyam //	The preceding sutra contains the definition of perception. In order to define it the other forms of knowledge are distinguished from it.

Some logicians hold that the word 'pūrva' denotes the subject of inference in a particular universe of discourse, viz., three kinds of controversy with discussion based upon the rules of logic at the head since it (the subject of inference) receives the first attention. The word 'pūrvavat' denotes the reason since the latter belongs to the subject of inference as has been clearly expressed.
pakṣe upayukte sati śeṣaḥ sapakṣo bhavati / so 'syāsaty āśrayatveneti śeṣavat /	The word 'seșa' denotes a similar instance since this locus is definitely known to contain the object to be inferred. The word 'seşavat' denotes the reason which belongs to a similar instance.
evam anena sapakKṣe vṛttir uktā bhavati /	Thus, it has been suggested that the reason belongs to the similar instance.
sāmānyatodṛṣṭam ity anena vipakṣāt vyāvṛttaṃ liṅgaṃ ucyate / katham akārapraśleṣāt sāmānyataḥ adṛṣṭam iti /	The compound word 'sāmānyatodṛṣṭa' suggests that the reason does not belong to contrary example. How is this meaning derived from it? The compound word is sãmânyato-adrs tam since the vowel 'a' has been inserted into it without any change in its sound.
tiṣṭhatu tāvad viśeṣaḥ sāmānyato 'pi na dṛṣṭam /	There is no trace of the reason, not to speak of some form of presence.
kveti pakṣasapakṣayor vṛtter uktatvāt pariśeṣāt vipakṣe sāmānyato 'pi na dṛṣṭm ity avatiṣṭḥate /	From which locus is it absent? It belongs to the subject of inference as well as to the similar example. Only the contrary example remains to be specified. No trace of the reason is to be found in the contrary example.
itthaṃ trirūpaṃ liṅgaṃ ebhiḥ śabdair uktaṃ bhavati /	Thus the above three words point to the three conditions of the reason.
tadālambanaṃ jñānam anumānam //	Anumâna is that knowledge which depends upon the three conditions of the reason.
tad evaṃ lakṣaṇe kaścit sarvaṃ sūtram ayojayat /	Some logicians hold that all the words of the sutra constitute the definition of anumâna.

If a reason has only thres conditions then the reason which has been adduced in the fallacy of Lalatyaya-apadista (the contradictory reason) or of prakaraņa-sama (counter-argument) should also pass for a sound one.
tasmāt tatpūrvakapadam eva lakṣaṇapratipādanārtham anavadyam //	Hence, only the compound word 'tat-pūrvaka' serves the purpose of a defectless definition.
trividhagrahaṇaṃ tasya vibhāgapratipādakam /	The word 'trividha' (three-fold) expresses the division ofMeaning of the word Pūrvavat 267 anumana.
bhedāḥ pūrvavad ityādigranthena kathitās trayaḥ //239// tatpūrvakapadodgītanirmalanyāyalakṣaṇāḥ /	The words 'pūrvavat', etc., denote the three kinds of anumana which has been defined by the compound word 'tat-pūrvaka' and bears also the epithet 'Nyaya'.
vibhāgavacanāt siddhaṃ traividhyaṃ svagirā bhavet /	The nomen- clature of the divisions clearly points to the three-fold character of anumana.

We infer that rain will come when we behold the cloud gathering in the sky.
atra codayati pūrvaṃ hi karaṇām ucyate /	They hold that the term 'pūrva' denotes a cause.
pūrvam asyāstīti pūrvavt kāryaṃ vaktuṃ yuktam / tena kāryāt kāraṇānumānam ihodāhartavyam na kāraṇāt kāryānumānam //	Thus, the type of inference which is called 'pūrvavat' is to be illustrated by the inference of a cause by means of an effect but not by the infe- rence of an effect by means of a cause.
na ca kāraṇena kāraṇām api pāryate /	It is impossible to infer an effect from a cause.
kāryasya tāvat pakṣatvam ayuktam siddhyasiddhivikalpānuvṛtteḥ /	First, it is unreasonable to think that an effect is a subject of inference.
siddhe hi kārye kim anyad anumeyam asiddhe khapuṣpavan na pakṣatvam //	Is it existent or not? If it is exis- tent then what else is to be established? If it is non-existent, it, being unreal like the sky-flower, cannot be the subject of infe- rence.

In this case, the reason and the consequence are two inco-ordinate objects. It is as absurd as is the syllogism that sound is non-eternal because the crow is black. Now, in order to establish the existence of an effect, if we posit the existence of a positive condition as a reason then the reason does not belong to the subject of inference.
dharmo viruddho 'bhāvasya sā sattā sādhyate katham ] iti //	How can we establish the existence of an effect? The existence of the positive condition constitutes the un- sound reason.
na ca kāraṇamātrasya hetutvaṃ yuktaṃ vinā ca pratibandhādinā vyabhicārasambhavāt / kāraṇaviśeṣaś ca na kaścid vipaścirā 'pi niścituṃ śakyaḥ /	How can the consequence in question be established ? Again, to prove the existence of an effect a non-specified cause cannot serve the purpose of the reason since the relation of universal concomitance must hold between the reason and the consequence.
caladacalavipulavapuṣām utpaladalamalīmasatviṣām api payomucām amuktapayasām uparamadarśanāt //	Sometimes we notice that massive clouds which are as dark as the leaf of a lotus-plant and look like moving mountain vanish into nothingness without shedding a drop of rain.

In other words, the inference of an effect is simply superfluous.
nanu saugatair api kāranāt kāryānumānam aṅgīkṛtam eva [hetunā yaḥ samagreṇa kāryotpādo 'numīyate /	The unholders of the original thesis may contend that the Buddhists also lend support to their view. They also hold that an effect is inferred from a cause.

agrandhajño devānāṃ priyaḥ utpādyate 'smād ity utpādo yogyatā kathyate /	They misinterpret the word 'utpâda'. It denotes the capacity for pro- ducing an effect. Its root-meaning is that by which an effect is brought into existence. This capacity which belongs to the con- ditions is here inferred.

The correctness of our interpretation has been borne out by the portion of the verse 'sa svabhāvo' anuvarnitaḥ.Meaning of the word Pūrvavat 269 Some other logicians (some Mîmāṁsakas) join issue with the objectors and sharply condemn them.

The gathering of the clouds in the sky and such other features of them constitute the reason. Hence, the objections mentioned above have no scope.
yathā agniṃ ānayaṃ dhūmaḥ bahulapāṇḍutādidharmayogitvāt mahānasāvadṛtadhūmavad iti dhūma evāgnimattayā 'numīyate /	This smoke is fiery because it has darkish white colour like the smoke in the kitchen. (The proposition that this smoke is fiery is in the sense that this smoke co-exists with fire in one and the same locus).

Hence, the clouds which contain the future rain are inferred. Kumārila Bhaṭṭa says to this effect.
yathā 'ha bhaṭṭaḥ [tasmād dharmaviśiṣṭasya dharmiṇaḥ syāt prameyatā /	The subject of inference containing the consequence is an inference.
sā deśasyāgniyuktasya dhūmasyānyaiś ca kalpitā] iti //	The spot which contains fire is to be inferred in this manner.
yat tu pūrvaṃ kāraṇām ucyate iti tat satyam /	The word 'purva' truly denotes a cause. The word 'pürvavat' denotes the property of a cause.
pūrvam asyāstīti pūrvavat kāraṇagatam unnatatvādidharmajātam ucyate tad eva liṅgam iti granthadoṣo 'pi na kaścit /	Its property, viz., the gathering of the cloud in the sky etc. is signified by the term "pūrvavať". This property constitutes the reason. Moreover, there is no linguistic defect in the statement of the proposition.
na ca kāraṇāmātrasya hetutvaṃ brūmaḥ yenāsya vidhurapratyayopanipātādikṛtaḥ vyabhicāraḥ syāt /	A non-spe- cified cause has not been stated as the cause of rain. Thus, there should be no chance of noticing the absence of rain in spite of the presence of the cloud.
api ca viśiṣṭam eva kāraṇaṃ hetuḥ /	The cause has been specified.

The cloud which rends the cave of a mountain by its thun- dering looks like a black bee, or a wild buffalo or a black cobra or a Tamåla tree and the massive body of which becomes frequently tawny brown being lit up by the constantly flickering270 light of the slender line of lightning never fails to associate it- self with rain.

But such a fear is unreasonable. When we actually infer rain, drops of rain do not fall on our head from the cloud. At least our experience does not give evidence to such a situa- tion.
[parokṣe liṅgini jñānam anumānam] iti ca viśeṣaṇopādānāt yatra tatra na tadānīm eva vṛṣṭiḥ pratyakṣībhavati tadudāharaṇāṃ bhaviṣyati //	Such knowledge is inferential as points to the consequence which is beyond the range of our sense-organ at the time of in- ference. We shall cite such examples where rain does not actually fall but is imminent.

No fear of its non-appear- ance is entertained. This is the situation when the above piece of cloth is inferred from the movement of the last thread for conjunction with the rest.
tathā hi ekatas tāvad antyatantau kriyādarśanam avinābhāvasmaraṇām prāmarśajñānam anumeyapratītir iti tricatvāraḥ kṣaṇāḥ /	Thus, we see that three or four moments are required from the start to the finish. Secondly, perception cannot also take place if the object is not present.

When our sense-organ will come into contact with the coloured object our perception will take place. Thus, we see that a good number of moments intervenes between the starting point and the perception of the object in question. Therefore, it is un- reasonable to hold that there are cases in which the perception of a future object takes place earlier than its inferential know- ledge. The non-appearance of the said effect owing to the absence of its condition or cause is not possible.
ato na kāryapratyakṣatvam // nāpi vidhurapratyayādinā kāryānutpattiḥ / anutpannāvayavakriyatvaviśeṣaṇopādānena tadvināśāśaṅkanāt /	Hence, no apprehension arises in our mind that the cause is to meet its destruction be- fore the production of its effect. Hence, the starting movement for conjunction is to be necessarily followed by the series of effects in the proper order.

In the above example in accordance with the strict syllogistic form the contact of the river with the ante- adjoining-country which has heavy shower of rain is to be in- ferred. The swelling of the river due to this contact is the reason.
vṛṣṭimatpṛṣṭhadeśasaṃsṛṣṭā iyaṃ nadī phenilakaluṣatvādiviśiṣṭapūropetatvāt pūrvopalabdhaivaṃvidhadhunīvat //	The river is in contact with an ante-country (a country over which it has flown) where a heavy shower of rain has fallen because it has its stream studded with foams, muddy and very rapid (strong) like a river seen before in a similar condition.

This country is adjoined to another ante- country which has heavy shower of rain because it has a river with swollen stream. If we adoptany one of these two syllogisms then our reasoning will not be open to the charges of the inco- ordination between the reason and the consequence etc.
phalatas tv iyaṃ vāco yuktiḥ kāryeṇā kāraṇam anumīyate kāraṇena kāryam anumīyata iti pramārthatas tu dharmī dharmavattvena dharmavān anumīyata iti sthitiḥ /	It is merely a verbal statement that a cause is inferred from its effect.

Who can know that the peculiar swelling of the river-the swelling which is only due to the heavy rain-fall? The river abounds in eddies, having its water risen very high.

vahadbahalaśaivālavanaśādvalasaṅkulaḥ / nadīpūraviśeṣo 'pi śakyeta na na veditum //247//	If the current of the river is embanked somewhere then the waters of the river swell somewhere else. Hence, the swel- ling of the river is not due only to the heavy shower of rain.
pramātur aparādho 'yam viśeṣaṃ yo na paśyati /	Thus, the reason in question is insufficient.
nānumānasya doṣo 'sti prameyāvyabhicāriṇaḥ//248//	Hence, we cannot safely infer rain from the movement of ants. The reason in question is uncertain.

But the commentator of the Nyaya-sūtra has given a different example of this type of inference. It runs thus The sun has motion because he comes into contact with the different objects at distant places.

na ca daśaśatāmśor deśāntareṇa śailādinā saṃyogaḥ saṃbhavati /	But this contact is imperceptible because it inheres also in the sky or the space.
nabhasā tu bhavann api viśā vā durlakṣyaḥ pratyakṣetaravṛttitvāt pavanavanaspatisaṃyogavat mātṛgarbhasaṃyogavad vā //	The contact in ques- tion is imperceptible like that of the air with a huge tree, or, like that of a foetal child with its mother's womb.
atha deśāntare taraṇidarśanaṃ hetur ucyate tasyāpi gatokāryatā pāramparyeṇa vidyate eva gatyā prāptiḥ prāptyā ca tatra darśanam iti//	Now, a logician may hold a brief for the commentator to revise the above syllogism and assert that the reason is the per- ception of the sun in a different country but not the contact of the sun with a different country. The perception in question may also be traced somehow to the motion of the sun as its remote cause.

The revised syllogism runs thus: (The sun is perceived at a distant country i.e., above distant garden in the evening). The perception of the sun above the garden is generated by the motion of the sun because it is a perception at a different place or because it is denoted by the phrase 'the perception of the sun in a different country' just like the275 Types of Inference perception of Devadatta in a different country.
na hi darśanatvaṃ gotvādivat sāmānyam asti kintu bhāvapratyaytenātra darśanotpādikā śaktir ucyate /	Darśanatva is not a universal belonging to all cases of percep- tion like the universal of gotva (cowness) which inheres in all cows. But the suffix 'tva' attached to the word 'darśana' denotes an abstract noun.
sā ca nātīndriyā nitiyā kācit api tu svarūpasahakārisvabhāvaiveti dṛśyamānaṃ svarūpam api śaktivarge patati / dṛśyamānaṃ ca deśāntaraprāptyātmakam iti gatikāryam //	It is not supersensuous and eternal. It is nothing but the accessory condition of perception itself. Hence, it is identical with the contact of the sun with another country. Such a contact is produced by his motion.
evaṃ darśanaśabdavācyatve 'pi hetukṛte vaktavyam /	In a similar manner, it may be pointed out that if the reason is denoted by the word 'darśana' then the type of the inference will remain the same.
gatyā deśāntaraprāptir janyate tayā tatra darśanam tena śabdaprayogaḥ sa eva vācyatvam iti bhāvapratyayenoktaḥ /	The perception of the sun at a distant place is possible if the sun has motion. What is the result of such a motion? He comes into contact with such a place. The percep- tion of the distant sun is possible if he is in motion. The word is really perception.
tasmāt sarvathā gatikāryatvānapāyāt śeṣavad evedam anumānam //	Hence, the revised syllogism is nothing but an instance of the Sesavat type of inference.
tad etad bhāṣyakārīyam udāharaṇām īdṛśam /	In fine, the instance of the samanyatodṛṣṭa type of inference as cited by the commentator on the Nyâya-sūtra is not sound.
rūpād rasānumānaṃ tu tasmād yuktam udāhṛtam //251//	The instance, shown by us, viz., the inference of taste from colour, is up to the mark.
akāryakāraṇaprāyahetūnāṃ ca pradarśitaḥ / bhadantakalahe 'smābhir udāharaṇavistaraḥ //252//	We have shown many instances of syllogistic arguments in which the reason and the consequence are not causally connected when we have disputed with the Buddhists.
evaṃ tāvan matubvyākhyayā traividhyam anummānasya varṇitam /	Further Types of Inference Having assigned the above meaning (the sense of having the suffix 'matup') the tripartite division of inference has beenNyayamanjari described.
etat tu phalguprāyam iva manyante /	But this division has been discarded as a house of cards by the logicians.
niyamātmakasambandhabalād eva liṅgasya gamaktvam uktam na kāryādisvarūupeṇa /	The reason establishes the consequence because the relation of universal concomitance holds between them, but not because the reason is either the cause or the effect of the consequence.
tat kim īdṛśatraividhyena darśiteneti vatipratyayam āśrityānyathā vyācakṣate //	Therefore, the above three-fold division has no solid ground to stand upon. The suffix 'matup' is to be replaced by the suffix 'vati'.
pūrvavad iti /	Let us see what is signified by the pūrvavat type of inference.

Hence, this type of inference is designated as pūrvavat. Let us take an example to bring home our point.
yathā mahānase dhūmāgnī sahacaritau dṛṣṭvā punaḥ dhūmāgnyanumānam //	In a kitchen we find that smoke and fire co-exist. In a hill we infer fire from smoke.

How is an act of inference similar to that of perception? Truly so. But the particular reason which is perceived along with all its details establishes fire which is similar to the fire as experienced before. As there is no difference with regard to their distinctive features so it will not be unreasonable to hold that the act of inference is similar to that of perception.
śeṣavan nāma pariśeṣaḥ /sa ca prasaktapratiṣedhe anyatrāprasaṅgāt śiṣyamāṇe saṃpratyayaḥ /	The seṣavat type of inference throws light on residue. It is an indirect proof. In order to explain a fact there are many possible alternative suggestions.

The con- clusion that fire is produced by the dried clod of cow-dung is indirectly arrived at.
yathā vā śabde drvyakarmatvapratiṣedhāt sāmānyādāv aprasaṅgāc ca guṇatvānumānaṃ vakṣyate //	We have no proof positive to establish our hypothesis. Sound may be either a substance or a quality or an action. Let us leave aside the hypothesis that sound is a quality.

Hence, it is indirectly inferred that sound is a quality. This type of inference is called as śeşavat because the remaining one is inferred.
indriyāṇām atīndriyatvāt na kadācit pratyakṣagamyatvam /	The sense-organs are supersensuous objects. Hence, they are never perceived.
atha ca chedanādikriyāṇāṃ paraśvadhādikaraṇapūrvaka vyāptigrahaṇāt śabdādyupalabdhikriyāṇāṃ karaṇāpūṛvakatvam anumīyate //	But we have discovered that the act of hewing and such other acts depend upon an instrument such as an axe, etc., as their cause. Thus we infer the instrumental cause from the act of perception such as hearing, etc.
atra [vati]vyākhyāne codayanti / pūrvavad evam ekam anumānam uktaṃ syāt na trividham /	They point out that if we subscribe to this view then there should be only one type of inference but the three-fold division of inference should not hold good.
yato na tāvad anavagatavyāptikaṃ liṅgaṃ gamakaṃ bhavati /	The reason which has not been known to be an invariable concomitant does not prove the consequence.
viśeṣāṇām anantatvena ca tadanvayavyatirekayor duravagamatvāt sarvatra sāmānyenaiva vyāptigrahaṇam /	The individuals, belonging to the classes of the reason and the con- sequence, are innumerable. Hence, it is different to discover the positive and negative aspects of the relation of universal con- comitance obtaining between the reason and the consequence.
yac cetthaṃ vyāptijñānaṃ tat tulyaṃ tritaye 'pi /	Such an abstract relation of universal concomitance is known alike in all the three types of inference.
ataḥ sarvaṃ pūrvavad eva syāt vateḥ sarvatra saṃbhavāt //	The so-called three types should merge into one type which bears the title of 'pūrvavat' since they are all similar to one another.
tad etad ayuktam avāntaraviśeṣasya suspaṣṭasya bhāvāt /	Such an objection is not tenable. Though they are similar from the broader point of view yet there are vivid minor diffe- rences among them.
[vyāptipūrvakam anumānam] ity etāvatā yady ekavidham ucyate tat satyam evaṃ prakāram evedam /	If you hold that all the said different types of inference are one because all inferences are grounded upon the relation of universal concomitance then we admit your contention to be true.
tasmin saty api tu sāmye bhedāntarasaṃbhavāt traividhyam asya pratipādyate //	But our point of view is this that though they are all similar because of the same common property yet they may be classed under the three different types because of their other differences.
tathā hi dhūmajvalanayoḥ pūrvaṃ pratyakṣeṇā grahaṇāt idānīṃ tenaiva bhūmena sa evāgnir anumīyate iti pūrvavad idam anumānam ucyate yat pratyakṣapūrvakam iti prasiddham //	Let us illustrate our point. Smoke and fire have been perceived before. Now we infer the same fire from the same smoke. Hence, this type of inference has been designated as 'pūrvavat'. It signifies that this type of inference depends upon perception as its cause.
nanu dhūmāntareṇa vahnyantarānumānaṃ kiṃ na pratyakṣapūrvakam ka ekam āha na pūrvavad iti kathaṃ tarhīdam ucyate tenaiva dhūmeneti jātyabhiprāyam etad ucyate na vyaktyabhiprāyam //	Now, a question arises in our mind that if we infer fire which has not been perceived from such particular smoke as has not been seen at the time of the discovery of the relation of uni- versal concomitance then does this inference depend upon per- ception as its cause? Who says that it does not belong to the type of 'pūrvavat ?' If it be so, how do you define 'pūrvavať' as an inference of the same fire from the same smoke? The answer is that we do not mean the particular but the universal.
nanu sāmānyatas tarhi tatparicchedāt sāmānyatodṛṣṭam evedaṃ syāt na sāmānyatodṛṣṭasya nityaparokṣānumeyaikaviṣayatvāt //	This objection does not hold good since the consequence in the samânyatodṛṣṭa type is only an inference, being imperceptible.
prasaktapratiṣedhādinā ca niyatasādhyaparicchedahetuḥ pariśeṣanumānam ucyate yathā gomayendhanadahanānumānam udāhṛtam śabde va guṇātvakalpanam //	In the other type of inference which is grounded upon the method of residue the consequence is known only through the process of elimination of the possible ones. Our previous illustration that this fire is produced by the dried clod of cow dung or that sound is a quality points to this direction.
sāmānyatodṛṣṭaṃ tu nityaparokṣaviṣayam udāhṛtam eva śrotrādyanumānam /	In the samanyatodṛṣṭa type of inference the consequence which is imperceptible by its nature is inferred. The inference of the auditory organ has been men- tioned as an example.
tad evaṃ bhedasaṃbhvāt trividham anumānam iti yuktam //	Therefore, inference admits of three- fold division because of the possibility of these differences.
āstām vā udāharaṇābhedaḥ ekatrāpy udāharaṇe traividhyam abhidhātuṃ śakyate /	The three different types of inference may be shown to apply to one and the same example.
yathā icchādikāryaṃ āśritam kāryatvāt ghaṭavat ity āśrayamātre sādhye pūrvavad anumānam /	Desire, being an effect, has a locus to stand upon because it partakes of the character of an effect like a jar. If a locus is only to be establi- shed then it is an example of the pūrvavat type.
prasaktaśarīrendriyādyāśrayapratiṣedhena viśiṣṭāśrayakalpane tad eva pariśeṣānumānam /	If a distinct locus is to be established by a process of elimination of the possible ones such as the body, the sense-organs, etc., then it illustrates the śeşavat type.
anumeyasya nityaparokṣatvāt tad eva sāmānyatodṛṣṭaṃ ca //	As the locus which is to be estab- lished is a supersensuous object so it is also an example of the sāmänyatodṛṣṭa type.

The procedure of Sesavat is one and that of Sämânyatodṛṣṭa is another.
icchādikāryaṃ dehādivilakṣaṇāśrayam śarīrādiṣu bādhakapramāṇopapattau satyāṃ kāryatvād iti sāmānyatodṛṣṭāsya kramaḥ /	Desire, being an effect, stands upon a locus which is other than the body, etc., because it partakes of the charac- ter of an effect and because of the cancellation of the judgment that the body or any material object is the seat of desire. This is the mode of operation of Sämänyatodṛṣṭa.
pariśeṣānumānasya tv itthaṃ pravṛttiḥ icchāder aśrayatvena prasaktāni śarīrendriyamanāṃsi niṣidhyante dikkālādau ca tatprasaṅgo nāsti tatpāriśeṣyād ātmaiva tadāśraya iti /	Seșavat operates in this way. The body or the sense-organ or the inner organ is the possible locus of desire. The possibility of each of them of being a locus is cancelled. The possibility of being a locus of desire is not to be extended to time, space etc. Therefore, the residual substance, viz.
pariśeṣānumāne ca sarvatra naiṣa niyamaḥ sādhyasyātiparokṣatvam iti gomayāgnikalpanādidarśanāt /	There is no hard and fast rule in the Sesavat type of inference that the280 consequence must be a supersensuous object. The fire, kindled by the dried clods of cowdung is proved by means of it.
sāmānyatodṛṣṭaṃ tu nityaparokṣaviṣayam eveti sūktaṃ traividhyam //	The consequence of Sämänyatodṛṣṭa is always a transcendental ob- ject. Therefore, the threefold division of inference has been nicely stated.
apare punaḥ adṛṣṭasvalakṣaṇāviṣayaṃ śaktikriyānumānaṃ sāmānyatodṛṣṭam udāharanti devadattādāv api kriyāyāḥ parokṣatvāt / calatīti pratyaye hi na devadattasvarūpātiriktakriyātattvapratibhāsaḥ //	Some other philosophers (the Mimāṁsakas) on the other hand hold that Samanyatodṛṣṭa is that type of inference in which no particular similar to the consequence has been per- ceived even at the time of the discovery of the relation of uni- versal concomitance. The illustration of it is the inference of power of action. An action which belongs to Devadatta re- mains imperceptible. The judgment that Devadatta moves refers only to Devadatta since his action is not perceived.
ya eva devadattātma tiṣṭhat pratyayagodaraḥ / calatīty api saṃvittau sa eva pratibhāsate //253//	The judgments that Devadatta stands still and that Devadatta moves refer alike to the same person.
aviralasamullasatsaṃyogavibhāgaprabandhaviṣayatvāc calatītipratyayasya na sarvadā tadutpādaḥ //	The predicate of the judgment is a compact series of con- junctions and disjunctions. Hence, this judgment does not always arise.

The answer to this question is as follows. An effect is an event in time. So, it depends upon its cause for its coming into being. If the substance-in-itself is its cause then effects will constantly issue of it since the paramount cause is always there. But the effect does not always come into being.
evaṃ śaktāv api draṣṭavyam /	Hence an ac- tion which is distinct from the cause is inferred, It should be noted that power is also thus inferred.
kriyāśaktisvarūpasya ca nityaparokṣatvāt taddṛṣṭasvalakṣaṇaviṣayam anumānam ucyate na tu viśeṣaviṣayam viśeṣavyāptigrahaṇāsyāsaṃbhavād iti //	It is not an inference of the particular because it is impossible to discover the relation of universal concomitance holding between the particulars. The thesis that all actions are transcendental is not reasonable.

This is a perceptual judgment. Hence, it is not tenable that all actions are an inference. If conjunction and disjunction would have been referred to by such a judg- ment then the form of the judgment should have been that it is united and disunited but not that it moves since the judgmentSesavat and Samanyatodṛsta distinguished accords with its object.
saṃvedanānusāriṇī ca viṣayavyavasthā /	We classify the objects of the universe, following the difference in the nature of reference of judgments.
anyathā ghaṭapratyaye 'pi paṭasyālambanatā syāt saṃyogavibhāgālambanatve sati tiṣṭhaty api calatpratyayaḥ prāpnoti tatrāpi saṃyogavibhāgasaṃbhavāt /	Otherwise, the awareness of a jar should have referred to some- thing else. If the judgment that it moves refers to its conjunc- tions and disjunctions then an object which stands still should be referred to by the judgment that it moves since it has every possibility of containing both conjunction and disjunction.
sthāṇau ca śyenasaṃyogavibhāgavati calatītipratibhāso bhavet /	A stable post on which a hawk sat and from which it flew away should be referred to by the judgment that the post moves.
aviralatadupajananaprabandhe 'pi bhūtabhāvinoḥ saṃyogavibhāgayoḥ parokṣatvāt vartamānayor grahaṇam /	Now, the Mīmāṁsakas may contend that the judgment involving of movement refers to a continuous series of conjunc- tions and disjunctions but the above judgment does not hold good. The past and future conjunctions and disjunctions are included in the series.
tau ca calitvā 'pi sthite devadatte sta iti tatrāpi kathaṃ na calatīti pratyayaḥ // nirantaraṃ ca saṃyogavibhāgaśreṇidarśanāt /	If Devadatta stands still after having walked some distance then conjunction and disjunction belong to him. As such why should not he be referred to by the judgment that Davadatta moves? 281 The ground is also seen to contain an uninterrupted series of conjunctions and disjunctions.
bhūmāv api bhaved buddhiḥ calatīti manuṣyavat //254//	It should also be referred to by the judgment that the ground moves like the men moving on the ground.
atha manuṣe yatkriyājanyatvaṃ saṃyogavibhāgayoḥ tatraiva calatītyādibuddhiḥ nānyatra / devadattakriyayā ca tau janyete na niṣkriyayā bhūmyeti na tasyāṃ tathā pratyayaḥ /	Now, the Mimāṁsakas may contend that the predicate *moves' is asserted only of that person whose action brings about conjunction and disjunction and that the predicate in question does not apply to the ground since it does not produce them (conjunction and disjunction) not action in itself.
yady evaṃ kriyānvayavyatirekānuvidhānāt kriyālambana evāyaṃ pratyayaḥ na saṃyogavibhāgālambanaḥ /	If they go so far then it is proper to admit that the above predicate refers only to an action but not to conjunction and disjunction since such a reference is established by the joint method of agreement and difference.
tadālambanatve hi tayor dvayavṛttitvāviśeṣāt viśeṣe kāraṇāṃ vācyam /	If conjunction and disjunction are referred to by the predicate 'moves' then they have to explain why they hold that the person moves but not the ground though both the person and the ground contain alike conjunction and disjunction.
yena puruṣa evāyaṃ pratyayaḥ na bhūmāv iti devadattakriyājanyatvena tu na viśeṣaḥ yataḥ kriyāyāḥ parokṣatve sati tad eva na vidmaḥ kim asau devadattāśrayā kriyā kiṃ vā bhūmyāśriteti saṃyogavibhāgakāryānumānasyobhayatrāpi tulyatvāt /	Now, the Mimamsakas may further contend that the judgment that Devadatta moves is only to be framed but not the judgment that the ground moves because the action of Devadatta is only responsible for conjunction and disjunction.282 Such a contention is not tenable. The action being supersensuous, we fail to know whether the action inheres in Devadatta or in the ground since it is only inferred from its effect, viz., conjunc- tion and disjunction.
na ca devadatte gacchati bhūmau anavaratavahadvahalasaṃyogavibhāgavaty api vā taraṅgiṇītīrapāṣāṇe calatīti pratyayo dṛṣṭaḥ /	When Devadatta walks on the ground we do never judge that the ground moves. When the breeze constantly blows over the banks of a river and has connection with and disjunction from the slabs of stone on them we do never judge that the slabs of stone move.
tasmāt kriyāviṣaya eva calatītipratyayaḥ na saṃyogavibhāgālambanaḥ //	Therefore we arrive at the conclusion that the verb 'to move' refers only to an action but not to conjunction and disjunction.
saṃyogavibhāgāgrahaṇe 'pi ca nirālambe vihāyasi viharati vihaṅgame calatīti saṃvedanaṃ dṛśyate / na a gaganasaṃyogaḥ pratyakṣaḥ pratyakṣetaravṛttitvāt gandhavahamahīruhasaṃyogavat //	When the bird mounts high towards the sky we perceive that it flies. In the unsupported sky no conjunction is perceived since such a contact with the sky belongs to the supersensuous sky as well. It remains ever imperceptible like the contact of the air with the tree. (If the two conjoining terms are not perceived then their contact is not perceived).
vitatālokāvayavyākāśaḥ tatsaṃyogaś ca patriṇāḥ pratyakṣa iti cet naitad evam tamālanīlajīmūtasamūhapihitāmbare / niśīthe sandhakāre 'pi calatkhadyotadarśanāt //255//	It may be held that the contact of the bird with a particular portion of the sky which is marked out by a flood of light is perceived. But such a defence is not tenable. When the sky is enveloped by the Tamala dark clouds we perceive in the dark night that the glow-worm is flying.
na tatrālokāvayavī kiś cana timirāvayavī vā vidyate iti kena saṃyogo gṛhyate vibhāgo vā bhūkampotpāte ca jāte calati vasumatīti matir asti / na tatra saṃyogavibhāgau gṛhyete bahulaniśīthe ca na tarām /	In that sky there is neither broad light nor darkness having parts. There no object with which the contact of the glow-worm and from which its separation will be perceived. When the earthquake takes place we experience that the earth is quaking but neither conjunction nor disjunction is seen.
tasmān na saṃyogādyālambanā calatīti matiḥ api tu kriyālambanaiveti //	Hence, the awareness of movement does not refer to conjunction, etc. but only to action.
na ca nityaparokā kriyā 'numātum api śakyā kāryasya kāraṇapūrvakatvena bhavanmate sambandhagrahaṇānupapatteḥ /	Again, if an action is absolutely transcendental, it cannot be inferred. You may hold that it may be indirectly inferred. Every effect has a cause. Conjunction and disconjunction are effects.
tasmān na kāryānumeyā kriyā //	Therefore, they have a cause. This cause is no other than an action.
na ca saṃyogānumeyā [saṃyogāntaṃ karma] itinyāyāt / vartamānāyāḥ kriyāyās tenānumātum aśakyatvāt / kriyā 'numānavādaś ca sāmānyalakṣaṇe vistareṇa nirastaḥ //	For, you hold that a substance-in-itself is not the cause of conjunc- tion, etc., but is the cause when it is qualified by an action. AsSesavat and Sämänyatodṛsta distinguished an action, being absolutely transcendental, is hard to perceive so a substance as qualified by an action is imperceptible.
etena śaktyanumānam api vyudastaṃ veditavyam /	Moreover, it is very difficult to perceive the essence of a cause.
tenādṛṣṭakriyāśaktisvalakṣaṇam iti kṣamam /	Hence, it is difficult to detect the relation of universal concomi- tance even in a similar example like a jar, etc.
parakaviracitānāṃ lakṣaṇānāṃ tv amuṣmin sati na bhavati śobhā bhāsvatīvendubhāsām //	But when we infer a transcendental object like the soul we face no difficulty since the object to be inferred has the dependent character.
idam idānīṃ cintyate /	We all perceive that a jar is dependent upon its cause, i.e., parts.
tad ucyate trikālaviṣayam anumānam iti /	Hence, in the similar example, the relation of universal concomitance is perceived.
ataś a yan mīmāṃsakair ucyate codanā hi bhūtaṃ bhavantaṃ bhaviṣyantaṃ sūkṣmaṃ vyavahitaṃ viprakṛṣṭam ity evaṃjātīyakam arthaṃ śaknoty avagamayituṃ nānyat kiñ ca iti tad ayuktam codanāvat pramāṇāntarasyāpy evaṃ jātīyakaviṣayatvopapatteḥ /	Therefore, we come to the conclu- sion that an action is not inferred from its effect.
asmadādīnām api kvacit iti //	The action is not also inferred from conjunction.
kāle sati traikālyagrahaṇaṃ cintyam sa eva tu durpapādaḥ /	The last effect of an action is conjunction and the action perishes in the next moment.
tadabhāve kasya vartamānādivibhāgo nirūpyate na tāvad gṛhyate kālaḥ pratyakṣeṇa ghatādivat /	Hence, an action which is actually present cannot be inferred from conjunction, its effect.
cirakṣiprādibodho 'pi kāryamātrāvalambanaḥ //257//	The predicate 'moves" refers to a present action.
na cāmunaiva liṅgena kālasya parikalpanā /	It cannot be inferred from conjun- tion and disjunction so long as it is present.
pratibhāsātirekas tu kathañcid upapatsyate / pracitāṃ kājcid āśritya kriyākṣaṇaparamparām //261//	An action comes into being in the first moment. It produces in the second moment disjunction which destroys the earlier contact in the third moment. In the fourth moment it produces a fresh subsequent contact with some other object.
na caiṣa grahanakṣatraparispandasvabhāvakaḥ / kālaḥ kalpayituṃ yuktaḥ kriyāto nāparo hy asau //262//	The subsequent contact is not per- ceived when it comes into being since the perception of an object is causally determined by its object.
loke kālpanikair eva vyavahāro bhaviṣyate //263// yadi tv eko vibhur nityaḥ kālo dravyātmako mataḥ /	If it (the subse- quent conjunction) is the reason of the inference of an action, the perception of the reason is necessary.
atītavartamānādibhedavyavahṛtiḥ kutaḥ //264//	Hence, the action which is actually present cannot be inferred.

The hypothesis that supersensuous power is an inference is also refuted in the light of this criti- cism.
krameṇa yugapat kṣipraṃ cirāt kṛtam itīdṛśāḥ /	The hypothesis that supersensuous power is objectively real has also been elaborately refuted in the earlier chapter (i.e., in the section on presumption).

How is it that colourless time is perceived? If you raise an objection like this then how do you yourself explain the perception of colourless colour? Or, how do you explain that the coloured atoms are not perceived? Our experience can only give an answer to these questions.
nanu dravye 'yam niyamaḥ na rūpādau /	The perception of all substances, is also not determined by it.
dravye 'pi nāyaṃ niyamaḥ yat rūpavat tat pratyakṣam iti yena paramāṇūnāṃ tathābhāvaḥ syāt /	If it had done so then atoms would have been perceived. The law should be re-stated in the following manner that all substances which are per- ceived are coloured.

If it is perceived, you should not argue against its perception on the ground that it is colourless. Let colour belong to the earth, water and light.
na cānuddhāṭitākṣasya kṣiprādipratyayodayaḥ /	A man who keeps his eyes shut up cannot have percep- tual judgments like these that it is quickly done, etc., since they have a necessary reference to time.

Our answer to this query is that the intrinsic property of time is responsible for it and time is not to blame on that account.

If it is held that when the coloured objects such as a stick, etc., become a predicate they are perceived but the colourless objects such as time, etc., are never perceived as a predicate. Such a view is not tenable.

The law that the coloured objects as a predicate are perceived may be restricted only to the sphere of substances. But we point out that such restriction is not possible as the reasons have already been stated. When- ever objects are perceived with eyes whatever comes within the range of eyes is perceived and it does not matter whether the object is coloured or not or whether it is a substance or not.
evaṃ guru dravyam iti kārtasvarādau pratibhāsāt gurutvam api pratyakṣaṃ na patanānumeyam eva // tasmāt svatantrabhāvena viśeṣaṇatayā 'pi /	Thus, we also perceive gold to be heavy and hence gravity belonging to such substances, is perceived. The hypo- thesis that gravity is only inferred from the falling down of the substances which it belongs to, is not tenable.

Therefore, time is a visible object, Space is also a percep- tible object because of the same reasons though the hypothesis in vogue holds that it is inferred from the concepts 'near', *remote', etc. Time is an Inference Some other logicians hold that the judgments such as 'Devadatta has a stick'.

Though all the perceptible conditions such as threads, the beams set in a loom, the shuttle, the weaver, ete., are the same yet we perceive the effect in a different manner at different times. Sometimes, we perceive that an effect is swiftly produced.

How does he explain swiftness or slowness belonging to vibrations themselves? What will be the objective ground of these concepts? There are judgments, viz., ‘This vibration is moving very slowly', 'That vibration is moving very swiftly', and so on. Some hold that vibration is surely the sine qua non of these judgments but it is not the ordinary vibration of Devadatta, etc., which determines the ideas of succession, simultaneity, etc.

Thus, time is nothing but the vibrations of planets, stars, etc.Time as an Inference The vibrations of planets and other heavenly bodies consti- tute the basis of conventional time. The time which is measured by us for our use such as yama (three hours) ahoră- tra (day and night), prahara (one hour and a half), etc.

This hypothesis is not tenable.

If you answer the first question in the affirmative then you should have held that succession independently follows from the intrinsic nature of effects such as a cloth, etc., which are being perceived by us and the assumption of time is superfluous. If you answer the second question in the affirmative then the new hypothesis is open to the fallacy of regressus ad infinitum since each condition, being dependant, requires the aid of another.

As it admits of no division, so how do you hold that the present, the past and the future objects are inferred? Our answer to this question is this that time does not really divide itself into three parts.

As it continues till the emergence of a result, i.c., boiled rice so it is called the present action, i.e., an action covering the present time. The sentence 'He cooks' illustrates it.

An act which is qualified by such result as will emerge is called the future action. The sentence "He will cook" illustrates it. Time- which is conditioned by such an action is thus called the future one.

Some hold that the present time does not exist. They argue in the following manner : When a leaf falls down from a tree the two spaces are only perceived, viz., the space which has been covered by it and the space which will be covered by it but the space which it covers at the present moment is not perceived.

upāyamātrāvagame tu śabdavyāpāraḥ //	Words, i.e., the instructions, given by a reliable person, play here only a secondarly part to enlighten the object in question.
yathā parārthānumāne agnimān ayaṃ parvataḥ dhūmavattvāt mahānasavad iti /	We also see that they (words) play no important part in a syllogism consisting of propositions, e.g., this hill is fiery since it is smoky like a kitchen.

tad iha yady āṭaviko nāgarikāya gavayārthine tadavagamopāyaṃ prasiddhasādharmyaṃ nābhyadhāsyat tarhi tadupadeśa āgama evāntarabhaviṣyat /	If the forester had not instructed the means of knowing the gavaya, viz., the similarity of a gavaya to a known cow to a citizen desirous of knowing a gavaya then his instruction would have been the verbal authority.
tadupadeśāt tu tata eva tadarthāvagama iti saty api śabdasvabhāvatve pramāṇantaram evedam /	It is surely a distinct proof though it consists of words.
pratipattā 'pi nāgariko nāraṇyakavākyād eva taṃ prāṇinaṃ gavayaśabdavācyatayā buddhyate kin tu sārūpyaṃ prasiddhena gavā tasya paśyati //	The citizen who sees the animal does not merely know that it is denoted by the term 'gavaya' from the instruction of the forester but experiences its similarity to a familiar cow.

We do not deny that the instruction has helped him to identify it. But it is a truism that his instruc- tion purports to suggest some other means, viz., similarity which points to its proper identification. The determination of the animal which does not immediately follow from the hearing of the instruction is not verbal knowledge but it is such know- ledge as is obtained by comparison. Though the instruction, given by the forester, consists of words yet it is reasonable to hold that it is a distinct proof called comparison.

This sensuous perception of resemblance which is called upamâna generates the knowledge of the relation between the term and the object denoted by it.
taddhīndriyajanitam api dhūmajñānam iva tadagocaraprameyapramitisādhanāt pramāṇāntaram /	Like the per- ception of smoke it (the knowledge of resemblance) leads to the identification of an object which has not been sensed though it contains sensible property. Hence, it is a distinct proof.

Recollecting it he comes to know that the term 'gavaya' applies to it, that is, this is denoted by the term (gavaya).
tad etat saṃjñāsaṃjñisambandhajñānaṃ tajjanyam ity upamānaphalam ity ucyate //	The resultant knowledge that this is designed as a gavaya is called upamiti. The proximate cause of it is called upamâna.

As the perception of smoke in a hill leads to the inferential knowledge of fire which is beyond the range of perception so the perception of a gavaya resembling a cow in a forest gene- rates the knowledge of the supersensuous relation of signification holding between a word and the object denoted by it.
yathā ca tatra pūrvāvagatadhūmāgnipratibandhasmaraṇaṃ sahakāritām upaiti tathehāpi pūrvaśrutāraṇyakavākyārthasmaraṇam /	As is case of inference the recollection of the pre- viously known universal concomitance holding between fire and smoke is the accessory condition so in the case of knowledge, based upon comparison, the remembrance of the content of a previous instruction inparting resemblance plays the part of an accessory condition.

The compound word 'sadhya-sādhana' requires interpretation. The word 'sādhya' denotes the relation of a word to an object denoted by it.

The compound word 'sādhya-sadhana'represents the knowing of the relation of a word to the object denoted by it. Or, the word 'sādhya' stands for the knowledge of the relation of denotation holding between a word and the object meant by it. The word 'sadhana' means generation. Thus, the compound word signifies302 Nyāyamanjari the generation of the knowledge of the said relation of denota- tion.

From the authoritative scriptures we learn that the knowledge of the self together with that of all the accessory details, leads to final emancipation. The veracity of the scriptures and speech is established by means of inference.

After having heard the instruction of a forester that a gavaya is like a cow he goes to a forest on some errand and sees a gavaya. Then he remembers a cow, seen by him, in the city. Afterwards he knows that a cow is like a gavaya. He derives the resultant judgment from the perceptual one "A gavaya is like a cow" called Upamana.
ata eva na tajjñānaṃ pratyakṣajanyam parokṣagopiṇḍaviṣayatvāt / aśrutātideśavākyasya bhāvān na śābdam //	Therefore, it (Upamiti) is gene- rated by the perceptual judgment that a gavaya is like a cow since it refers to a cow which is beyond the range of perception. No instruction is heard to inform us of the content of this judg- ment and hence it is not a piece of verbal knowledge.

But the cow is never remem- bered as similar to a gavaya since its similarity to a gavaya which is being perceived now has not been experienced before. Hence, the judgment that a cow is like a gavaya is not that of memory.

tasmāt smṛtireveyam tathā hi pratīti [anena sadṛśo gaurmayā nagare dṛṣṭaḥ] iti /	Hence it is reasonable to hold that similarity to a gavaya is experienced when a gavaya is not distinctly cognized.

How can a villa- ger know that a cow is similar to a gavaya if he has no definite knowledge of a gavaya, the other correlative of the relation of similarity? The reply, given by the Naiyāyikas to this ques- tion is as follows.
pratiyoginyadṛṣṭe 'pi tasmāttadupalabhyate //30//	If the Mimāṁsakas raise this question, they simply contradict their previous statement.
sa ca bhūyo 'vayavasāpnānyayogo 'gṛhītagavayavenāpi nāgarakeṇa grahītuṃ śakyate //	They (the Mimāṁsakas) hold that similarity, like a universal resides wholly in each of its many locii.

Again, what is similarity according to them? They say that the common possession of many limbs is called similarity.

If the Mimāṁsakas hold that the villager does not know that cow is like a gavaya even if he perceives those limbs which are shared in common by the two similar objects (a cow and a gavaya). They now discard the above definition of similarity that similarity is the common possession of many limbs.
yāvatā sādṛśyapratyayotpattiriti cet tarhi sadṛśapratyayahetutvam eva sādṛśyamastviti yuktam /	The re- vised definition of similarity as offered by them is that simila- rity is the unique source of the awareness of similarity.

A dissimilar animal also possess- es some of the same limbs such as hoofs, etc., as a cow possess- es. Now, the Mimāṁsakas may hold that they do not know the exact number that constitutes the number 'many' which is required for the idea of similarity.

It really repeats the revised definition of similarity stated above that similarity is that which generates the idea of similarity. Hence, the implicit awareness of similarity is logically possible even when a gavaya has not been perceived at all.

But with the perception of the similarity ofa cow belonging to a gavaya (i.e. comparison) it is rightly and distinctly grasped.

Owing to this similarity, comparison throws light on the nature of subsidiary rites so that these rites in honour of the god of fire can be applied to the rite in honour of the sungod. More- over, there is another point which is worth-noting that if aNyayamanjari substance which has been enjoined as a means is not available then its substitute will suffice to complete the action. Suppose, barely has been enjoined to prepare a particular food to be offered.
[āgneyo 'ṣṭākapālaḥ] ityupadiṣṭadṛṣṭādṛṣṭetikartavyatākalāpatayā nirākāṅkṣo vidhiḥ /	Hence, a distinct type of knowledge based upon comparison has been admitted. The Naiyāyikas point out that they cannot argue in this strain. The reason of controverting it has been already mentioned. (Memory is not valid knowledge since it simply reveals known object.
[sauryaṃ caraṃ nirvapet grahmavarcasakāmaḥ] ityatra pradhānamāgropadeśādvidhyādirastina tu vidhyantaḥitikartavyatā 'bhidhānam /	Hence, there is no need of keeping the discussion up any more.

If the Mimamsakas stick to their hypothesis then no substi- tute can be taken in.

Therefore we, the Mimāṁsakas, hold that comparison renders a special service in such cases.
pratinidhirapi caivaṃ vrīhisādṛśyayogāt bhavati tadapacāre yatra nīvārajātau /	If barley is somehow defective then wild rice acts in its place as its substitute in a Vedic rite.

The second rite is familiar because the details of its subsidiary actions are given. The first rite may be compared to a gavaya. The second one may be com pared to a cow. The above judgment corresponds to the judg-Mimāṁsaka View Contradictory ment that a gavaya is like a cow.

If the Mîmāmsakas hold that as the rite, observed in honour of the god of fire, is remembered so its minor details are borrowed. They also add that the object which is remembered flashes in our mind along with such extra objects as memory cannot supply. Hence, a distinct type of knowledge based upon comparison has been admitted.

The Mīmāṁsakas, if they are sincere to their conclusion, cannot hold that wild rice is like barely but that barely is like wild rice. But the judgment that barley is like wild rice serves no useful purpose.

Hence, the author of the Nyâya-sûtra proposes to define verbal authority just after the definition of comparison. The sutra which embodies the definition of sabda runs thus "Aptopadeśaḥ śabdaḥ”.

In order to make definition complete, we are to borrow a few words from the sutra which constitutes the definition of percep- tion and to construe them with the word 'upadeśa' (all asser- tions) in the sutra in question: the word 'jñāna’ ‘artha’ ‘vyava- sãyátmaka' and 'avyabhicari' are to be borrowed. The word 'jñāna' (consciousness) represents the result of an assertion. The word 'artha' reveals the nature of the resulting conscious- ness and the adjective 'vyavasāyāatmaka' (determinate) expresses its form.
tadevaṃparyāyamevopadeśaśabdaṃ śabdalakṣaṇamapekṣitapūrvasūtropāttaviśeṣaṇapadaṃ kecidvyācakṣate / āptagrahaṇaṃ ca lakṣaṇaniścayārthamāhuḥ /	Thus, an assertion, which is qualified by such adjectives as are taken from the sūtra on per- ception, constitutes the reliable source of verbal knowledge. Some other logicians hold that the adjective 'apta' (reliable) has been given to convey the exact character of the definition in question.
[ghrāṇarasanatvakcakṣuḥśrotrāṇīndriyāṇi bhūtebhyaḥ] ityatra bhūtagrahaṇaṃ vakṣyate /	In the sûtra "the sense-organs such as nose, tongue, skin, eyes and cars spring from clements" the word 'bhūta' has313 Verbal Authority a definite purpose to serve and its utility will be shown later on.
evaṃ hyaitihyasya na pramāṇāntaratā bhaviṣyati upadeśarūpatvāviśeṣāditi //	Similarly, the adjective 'apta' 'has been used to refute the hypothesis that rumour is a distinct source of knowledge and has the object in view to establish that 'rumour' (aitihya) is distinct from sabda.
anye tu bruvate yuktamupadeśapadameva śabdalakṣaṇam /	Some other logicians hold that the word 'upadeśa' (asser- tion) constitutes the exact definition of sabda pramāṇa (the means of verbal knowledge).

The definition is too wide as it is also applicable to them.

In fine, it is to be noted that the wording of the sutra which constitutes the definition of314 śabda pramāņa should be rigidly adhered to and not a singlè· word from a previous sütra should be borrowed in order to frame the definition in question.

svāvagatipūrvikā pratītiriti cet dhūmāderapyupadeśatāprasaṅgaḥ /	Now, the upholder of the above view may contend that the word 'upadeśa' does not denote conscio- usness in general but some specific form of it.

A word which is sound in essence should be non-upadeśa since the consciousness which is produced by a word does not resemble its cause. Moreover, if consciousness signifies only the awareness of sound, the auditory sense-organ becomes the only source of such awareness. In that case, the word 'upadeśa' should deno- te only the auditory sense-organ.

Hence, a word is a collection of such sounds. But what is not audible is not a word such as a sphota (a sub- the entity which is assumed for the communication of the mean- ing of a word).

As there is no distinct form of consciousness which is signified by the verb "to denote" so every form of consciousness is meant by it. In that case, as a word is not the only source of such consciousness so the above definition suffers from the defect of being too wide.

Moreover, the truth of the verbal knowledge is ascertained when we learn that the sentence, the source of the said knowledge, has been uttered by a trustworthy person. Again, we are also to read the intention of the speaker of the sentence in order to make out its exact sense.

As reference is an incentive to the unfolding of creative imagination so in some cases the coinage of new words such as 'aśva' etc.

Hence, under no circumstances, a word can rise to the status of a sentence.) (An objector may contend that the knowledge of the meaning of a word may not be inferential but the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence is surely inferential.

tadvanmātraṃ padasyārtha iti ca sthāpayiṣyate / anumānaṃ tu vākyārthaviṣayamatrāgniḥ agnimān parvata iti tataḥ pratipatteḥ /	Hence, śabda is not included in inference. Now it may be contended that as the subject of inference, as qualified by the consquence, is established in an inference so let a word, as qualified by the object, denoted by it, be established in a verbal judgment.

In that case, the reason cannot be the subject of inference. Now, the objector may defend himself against the review, citing example from the works of the critics.
gomān kaḥ ityākāṅkṣāyā anivṛtteḥ //	It is this that smoke is fiery because it has smokeness like smoke in a kitchen.

The syllogistic process is as follows. The word 'cow' contains the object denoted by it because it has cowness, i. e. the universal, which belongs to the word 'cow'.

It is possible to prove the first alternative. There is no bar to hold that the hill contains fire. But we cannot hold in a similar manner that a word contains the object signified by it. It may be argued "As an object is conveyed by a word, so a word, having denoted it, contains itVerbal Authority and Inference distinguished 321 by means of the relation of denotation." Such a defence is not tenable.

In that case is there any necessity of assuming that the object is located upon a word? If it is held that an object finds its locus in a word because it is denoted by the latter. In this way the object which is located upon a word is made known as such. The object, the knowledge of which is produced by a word, is denoted only by it.

It may be held that the knowledge of an object is possible even before the drawing of the conclusion of the said inference and that the word as qualified by the knowledge of an object may be taken322 for granted.
jvalanādāvapi tulyo vikalpa iti cet na hi tatrāgnirdhūmena janyate api tu gamyate /	Smoke does not produce fire but merely indicates it. But in the present case a word produces the knowledge of an object.

In fine, a word cannot be the subject of inference.

Then, the object which is denoted by the word is inferred. As it takes a long interval of time to complete the inferential process so the word 'cow' the essence of which is sound the subject of inference passes away by this time.
na parvatavadavasthiti tasya / api tūccaritapradhvaṃsitvaṃ śabdasya /	Sound is not a durable object like a hill but it lasts only for two time-atoms (the time-atom stands for the minutest unit of time). An unsophisticated person does not know that the word has the object (i. e.
na ca śabdamarthavattvena lokaḥ pratipadyate kintu śabdāt pṛthagevārthamiti na sarvathā śabdaḥ pakṣaḥ /	the word is intimately related to the object). But he realizes that there is no perceptible rela- tion between the word and the object. Hence, by no means the word can constitute the subject of inference.

na cārthasya dharmitvam siddhyasiddhivikalpānupapatteḥ / na ca taddharmatvaṃ śabdasya śakyate vaktum tatra vṛttyabhāvāt /	But the verbal know- ledge does not require them for its coming into existence. If it be so then as the word cannot be the subject of inference so the universal of cowness that belongs to the word cannot constitute the reason.

Therefore, the hypothesis that the object which is said to be denoted by a word is an inference does not stand the test of reasoning. Moreover, if it is urged that as a word qualifies an object so the former belongs to the latter then the object should be trea- ted as the subject of inference as qualified by the word, be- longing to it.
anvayavyatirekāvapi tasya durupapādau deśe kāle ca śabdārthayoranugamābhāvāt /	Similarly, a person who is ignorant of the relation of denotation should have known that a word belongs to the denoted object.

Now, it may be argued that though when the word 'Yudhişthira' is pronounced, the ob- ject, meant by it, does not exist yet the very word is inseparably connected with the meaning of it.

Does it do so before the knowledge of the object or afterwards?" If they answer the first alternative in the affirmative then it may be pointed out that such a relation is not possible since the object, being not present before our mind, is as good as a non- entity.

The absurdity of the application of the negative method to the relation is also evident from the trend of the above argument. 324 When an experienced person asks another experienced person to do something he utters two sentences. In one sentence a particular word finds a place.
api ca dhūmādibhyaḥ pratītiśca naivāvagatipūrvikā / ihāvagatipūrvaiva śabdādutpadyate matiḥ //24// sthaviravyavahāre hi bālaḥ śabdāt kutaścana /	In the other sentence it is conspicuous by its absence. An inexperienced learner who listens to these two sentences notes the presence of a particular word in one of the two sentences and its absence from the other one.

Thus, we see that the joint method of agreement and difference helps us to determine the relation of denotation of a word. Hence, the above joint method, being applied, has a special service to ascertain the relation of denotation. Kumärila has stated that if a word is related to an object then that object is only denotedVerbal Authority and Inference Distinguished 325 by that word.
evaṃvidhaviṣayabhedāt sāmagrībhedācca pratyakṣavadanumānādanyaḥ śabda iti siddham //	But it will also be pointed out in this connection that the knowledge of an object arises from a word because of the convention.

etena vivakṣāviṣayatvamapi pratyuktam /	Such a critical remark is too fair since the results, arrived at by them, are different.
na hi vivakṣā nāma śabdasya vācyo viṣayaḥ kintvartha eva tathā //	A sentence which is uttered by a reliable person does not produce knowledge because it has been uttered by a reliable person.

It is unfair to hold that if the validity of verbal knowledge is not established then such knowledge merely refers to an imaginary object since it is universally experienced that words produce the knowledge of objects.

If a defectless person utters the sentence that there stand a hundred elephants on the tip of a finger then the sentence is sure to produce illusion.
arthaparatve tu niṣedhakavākyataiva na syāditi / tasmādāpravakyānāmayathārthatvābhāvānna svato 'rthāsaṃsparśinaḥ śabdāḥ /	Hence, the conclusion does not follow from the above observation that it is in the nature of words to produce illusion but the defect in the speaker does not produce illusion.

If we know that the yonder object is not silver then the object cannot produce the illusory experience that it is silver (i. e.
naitadevam !anuccaritaśabdo 'pi puruṣo vipralaṃbhakaḥ /	we see the -object with our eyes and do not mistake it for silver).

As words are the creature of imagination so they produce330 illusion in the face of a real counteracting contradictory judgment. This is what is called the dissociation of words with the real objects.
ataḥ puruṣadoṣānvayānuvidhānāt puruṣadoṣakṛta eva śabdādviplavaḥ na svarūpanibandhanaḥ /	So the dis- cordance of words with the real objects constantly follows from the very nature of words. This is the sum and substance of the argument of the Buddhist logicians against the validity of verbal knowledge.

It follows from the above hypothesis that a person plays only the part of a speaker, and that a word presupposes no relation with the object to be denoted by it.
yuktaṃcaitadeva yahīpavatprakāśatvamātrameva śabdasya svarūpam na yathārthatvamayathārthatvaṃ vā /	On the contrary it is reasonable to hold that it is the essence of a word that it reveals an object like a lamp. It should also be noted that correct or incorrect representation of an object does not constitute the essence of a word.

Why do you introduce a broader issue, viz., the problem of the validity of all knowledge, leaving aside the point at issue, viz.
yathā 'nyeṣāṃ svataḥ parato vā prāmāṇyaṃ tathā śabdasyāpi bhaviṣyatīti /	As the validity of all other forms of knowledge is either in- trinsic or extrinsic so that of verbal knowledge will also obey the same rule.

Again, the invalidity of a piece of knowledge could not have come into being if it were not generated by a special condition.
tatra dvayamapi svata iti tāvadasāṃpratam pravṛttasya visaṃvādadarśanāt /	It presupposes a distinct factor for its appearance.

Again, we know a piece of knowledge to be false when we definitely know that it is contra- dicted by its contradictory judgment. Hence, a piece of false knowledge does not arise independently of special factor and a piece of knowledge is not known as false whenever we are aware of it.
svato hyaprāmāṇye niścite pravṛttir na prāptotīti / kiñca aprāmāṇyamutpattau karaṇadoṣāpekṣam /	They also hold that it is unreal as it is negation and that it does not owe its existence to an additional condition such as deficiency or some other factor.

tat kathaṃ svatobhavitumarhati yac ca [aprāmāṇyamavastutvānna syāt kāraṇadoṣataḥ] iti kaiściducyate tadapi yatkiñcit / saṃśayaviparyayātmanaḥ apramāṇasya vastutvāttadnatamaprāmāṇyamapi vastveveti /	Thus, the untruth or invalidity of a piece of untrue knowledge, being its abstract property, cannot be unreal. Moreover, the validity of a piece of knowledge does not owe its existence to a distinct factor. And the view that a piece of knowledge is known to be true afterwards when it is verified (i.e.
paratastu prāmāṇyaṃ yathā nāvakalpate tathā vistareṇocyate //	when it is submitted to a real test and that validity "owes its existence to a distinct factor will be elaborately discussed in the following paragraphs of this section.
evañcāyaṃ dvayamapi parata iti dvitīyapakṣapratikṣepo 'pi bhaviṣyati /	Thus, second part of the hypothesis that (a) the invalidity of a piece of knowledge is extrinsic and that (b) the validity of a piece of knowledge is extrinsic will also be refuted.
arthatathātvaprakāśakaṃ hi pramāṇamityuktam /	It has been stated that a piece of knowledge is true if it reveals an object in its 'true character.
tasya svaprameyāvyabhicāritvaṃ nāma prāmāṇyam / ataśca parāpekṣāyāṃ satyāṃ hi parata iti kathayitumucitam /	Now, if the said truth depends upon a distinct factor for its appearance and if it is cognized to be such only in relation to something other than itself then it is called as extraneously determined and known.

"What is the extra object by the aid of which the true knowledge requires to discharge its normal function?" And "What is the standard by which the truth of a piece of knowledge is tested ?" If it is admitted that the validity of a piece of knowledge owes its existence to an extraneous factor then what is this extraneous factor? Is it nothing but the essence of the conditions that produce it? Or is it simply a qualitative improvement of the same conditions responsible for a piece of valid knowledge? If the assemblage of the conditions of a piece of knowledge and that of valid knowledge are basically the same, then the Naiyayikas simply try to establish the established hypothesis. If the conditions are absent then a piece of knowledge which is an effect cannot come into being.

It is also very difficult to establish the hypothesis that the validity of a piece of knowledge depends upon a special factor which is distinct from the conditions, though all the conditions of a piece of knowledge and those of the so-called qualitative improvement of the same conditions is unreal like the sky-lotus, since its existence has not been proved.

Hence, how can the quality be perceived since it belongs to a sense-organ, a transcendental object? It is not an inference since the relation of concomitance holding between it and its mark cannot be detected.

It does also independ- ently play its part. It derives its nature of illuminating an object only from its own cause. The function of a true judgment is only to reveal an object. The movement on the part of a a knower for the revealed object is due to his choice and final resolution in favour of the same object.

The drift of this argument is that an awareness depends upon its own nature for the illumination of an object.

Again a true judgment does not require the aid of an extra factor in order to apprehend its own essential attribute, viz., validity, since there is nothing else to be depended upon.

Or, does it presuppose the knowledge of the absence of a contradictory (preventive) judgment? Or, does it presuppose the consilience of the judgment with another true judgment? The first hypothesis that the determination of the validity of a true judgment presupposes the knowledge of a new quality of the cause of the judgment and that the validity in question is supposed to belong to the cause is not tenable since the presence of such a quality in the cause of the judgment will be immediately refuted in the following paragraph.

Again, if it is held that the determination of the validity of the said judgment precedes his movement then such a statement is a glaring instance of circular reasoning. When a person moves he knows that his action is successful. When he knows that his action has turned out to be successful he comes to know that the cause of his judgment has the specifi- ed quality.

Or does it mean that a judgment is consilient with another judgmentThe Mimamsaka view of the Validity of Knowledge which refers to the utility of the object of the first one as its object? We draw the attention of those logicians who are in favour of the first meaning of the term 'consilience' and put this question to them "wherein lies the distinction between the prior and the posterior judgments so that the prior one is recognized as true if it thoroughly agrees with the posterior one".

Similarly, though the knowledge, produced by a defective sense-organ, is due to the defect yet the truth of the knowledge in the second example is cancelled because it has been generated by the unauthorised or unvedic cause.

But we communicate our per- ceptual judgment by means of the proposition that this is silver. An ordinary person who is under the sway of a doubt does not proceed to have the object which is doubted. But when he is sure of the object he moves for it. Why do you ascribe the character of a doubt to a judgment which is not experienced to be so? 354 The Naiyãyikas join issue with the Mīmāmsakas and establish their point by the following argument.
yadi tāvat spaṣṭatā viśeṣaḥ śuktikāyāmapi rajatāvabhāsaḥ spaṣṭa eva na hi tatrānadhyavasāyakāluṣyaṃ kiñcidasti //	It is a fact that the judgment in question refers to a single object and that there is no oscillation between two alternatives. But still it does not fur- nish the knower with a means to determine the true nature of the object.
atha niṣkampatā śuktikāyāmapi rajatāvabhāso niṣkampa eva /	Hence, it, by force of logic, represents to it as a doubt. A doubt, also, assumes the form of a judgment.

Though the prior judgment that this is silver refers to a single object yet it is virtually nothing but a doubt.

On the other hand, if it is known to be untrue then how can it impel a person to move ? As we can know it neither as true nor as untrue so it should be a doubt. Why are you (the Mimāṁsakas) angry upon us (the Naiyāyikas)? It is a truism that though this event of consciousness is not experienced as a doubt yet it is logically established that it is a doubt. Even if we move for our accustomed objects, a true judgment does not guide us.

They also hold that they do not subscribe to the view that the said truth being not an effect an extra quality of the cause is not responsible for its existence.

Such a know- ledge helps us in an indirect manner to determine the truth of the Vedas, the source of verbal knowledge, viz., other scriptures, etc. the source which deals with the transcendental objects. Though the determination of the truth of a judgment referring to an ordinary object is futile so far as its own object is concern- ed yet it has some worth, having an important part to play.

What is the meaning of the com- pound word 'pravṛtti-sāmarthya'? Because the Naiyāyikas hold that the determination of the truth of a judgment depends upon it (pravṛtti-samarthya). The old teachers of the Nyaya schoolThe Mīmāṁsaka view about the truth of a judgment refuted explain it in the following two ways :-(1) Pravṛtti-samarthya is the confirmation of the knowledge of an object in its experi- enced order after its pragmatic test. (2) Or, the discovery of the unique property of an object is pravṛtti-samarthya.

But the deeper meaning of it is the putting of the knowledge to a practical test. Samarthya means the experience of the actual result, i.e., the experience of the practical efficiency of the said object.

If there is no distinction between them as instances of know- ledge then the truth of the former, being extrinsic, requires the services of another knowledge for its determination. The third one requires the services of a fourth one and so on ad infinitum.

We do not raise the problem whether the knowledge of the effects of an object is valid or not because we never enter- tain a doubt about its validity.

This judgment prompts us to move. But we also know that a similar judgment takes place even when we mistake the rays of the sun for water.

As there is no doubt about its validity so no argumentation is required to establish its truth since a doubt is the mother of argumentation. Or, as we experience the specific forms of the practical effi- ciency of water so we determine the truth of the knowledge of them. What is the exact nature of the specific form? The acts of cleansing the impurities of a body, sipping, bathing, offering libations to gods and departed ancestors, washing the clothes, removing fatigue and heat and indulging in sports like swimm- ing etc.

If a man has an illusory experience of water and proceeds to have it then he cannot perform all these acts by means of the water referred to by the false judgment.

Why do you examine only the conditions of the knowledge of practi- cal efficiency. The Naiyãyikas give a fitting reply to them. They say, "Oh dear friends ! you do not think that the condi- tions of the initial impellent judgment have not been examined through an inadvertence. If they are examined then is the hypothesis of intrinsic validity established ? Does such an exa- mination refute the hypothesis of extrinsic validity, proposed by us? But when an impellent judgment arises in the mind of a person he becomes very much anxious to get at the fruit of his knowledge but exhibits no such eagerness for scrutinizing the conditions of his judgment.

No body doubts the truth of the knowledge of the practical efficiency of an object but on the contrary, every body knows it to be true because a doubt obeys a universal law in order to come into being.

As there is no previous experience of discordance between the above piece of knowledge and its object so it is known only to be true. The present means of the determination of its truth will do the same function in future. Hence, the truth of the knowledge of practical efficiency will always be uniformly determined.

Should the knowledge itself of the distinctive mark of an object be proved to be valid? Or, does the truth of such knowledge remain unascertained? If we answer the first question in the affirmative, the fallacy of regressus ad infinitum invalidates our assumption.

But he holds that when an object has been frequently moved for and obtained the knowledge of such an object it is intrinsically true. He really does not follow what he preaches though his attention has been invited to his statement.

Thus, the truth of such perceptions has been established by the successful movement.

If it is done by a valid proof will the proof itself be examined or not? It is next to impossible to examine a proof. Hence a proof escapes an examination, and you hold that the truth of the resulting knowledge is to be tested by the untested proof. But it will be still better to hold that there is no need of verifying the resulting consciousness but our movement for all practical purposes will directly ensure from the proof because the former alternative suggestion is open to the fallacy of regressus ad infinitum.

How can we appreciate their skill in a logical approach? If the hypothesis of misapprehension is admitted then it is easy to come across such judgments as are contradicted.

If no doubtHypothesis of misapprehension refuted 367 as to the truth of a judgment arises in his mind then why should he look forward to some other judgment for its verifica- tion? The truth of a judgment becomes automatically self- evident. Why is it that there is no such judgment as is contradicted? We all experience that there is a large number of instances of illusory judgments which are contradicted, for example, we mistake the mother-of-pearl for silver.

Now, the Naiyāyikas may hold that contradiction is such as takes away the object referred to by a judgment.

The relation of contradiction does not hold between two such judgments as have the same content since we have no experience of contradiction in a series of judgments pointing to the same object. The relation of contradiction does not hold between two such acts of knowledge as refer to the different objects since the knowledge of a post is never contradicted by the knowledge of a jar.

I Moreover, when the truth is assured of the preceding judgment it stands on a firm footing. But when a new judg- ment arises in our mind at a subsequent period it remains weak since its truth has not been established.

(This question has been put by the Naiyāyikas to the Mimāṁsakas of the Prabhakara school). A reply to this question is as follows: Oh dullards! those judgments are not illusory because no cause whatsoever it may be, can be found out to explain their origination.

Such a cause exhausts all its poten- tialities to give birth to its own effects, fixed up by Nature. Hence, a heterogeneous effect will not be produced by it since it acquires no special efficiency by dint of its possession of defect to do so. The defective paddy of the fäli species would never have the efficiency of producing the Barley plant.

The predicate silver repres sents the memory of silver experienced before. The knower has the impression of the experience of silver. When the shining object, the substantive of the above judgment is perceived, the impression of silver is excited by the law of similarity and the memory of silver is revived.
ataścedaṃ smaraṇaṃyataḥ praganavagatarajatasya na jāyateviditarajatasyāpi rajanyāmanyadā vā sādrśyadarśanādvinā na bhavatīti //	If a man who has seen silver cannot recollect it at night or in the day if he misses to see the object as similar to silver".Hypothesis of Misapprehension as an Offspring of other Hypotheses 371.

When memory is not recognised in its true character the distinction between memory and apprehension is not detected. The non-detection of difference is called non- apprehension (akhyāti).
tathā hi bhrāntabodheṣu prasphuradvastusaṃbhavāt / catuṣprakārā vimatirudapadyata vādinām //83//	As objects are revealed by the illusory experience so there are four rival hypotheses current among the contesting logi- cians.

(2) Or, the mother-of-pearl which conceals its own distinctive form and assumes the form of silver, produces the consciousness of silver. (3) Or, the stimulating object is one and its appearance is something different.

yadi santautarhi taddeśakālamevedaṃ rajatamavabhātamiti na bhrāntireṣā syāt /	Now, if the Naiyâyikas subscribe to the first alternative, viz., silver stimulates the eyes then the awareness of silver refers only to the unreal object.
asantau tūbhāvapi rajatavat nālambanaṃ bhavitumarhati //	But it is not a case of misreading since the unreal silver is presented to such consciousness.

Or, are the non-existent ones presented to our consciousness? If with regard to the first alternative they answer in the affirmative then silver which is here and now has372 been presented. Hence, it should not be a case of illusion.
smṛteranarthajatvameva svarūpamiti cet astu kāmamtatsāmānyādatrāpyevaṃ prayoga ityetadapi tāvanna brūmaḥ /	The predicate is wrongly referred to the mother-of-pearl as 'this', i.e., the subject of the said judgment. In other words, the judgment of memory that this is silver wrongly refers to the mother-of-pearl.
tathā tvanarthajanyayā smṛtyā so 'rthaḥ kathamiha sannidhāpayituṃ pāryate /	But how can a past object be referred to? Remembrance is nothing but consciousness.

The reason at the back of this note of dissent is this: How can the judgment of memory, which is not produced by an object, present an unreal object to consciousness? The reason is plain, viz., the act of memory is in no way connected with the object which is supposed to be presented by it.
bādhakena hi jñānena pūrvajñānagṛhītasya vastuno 'sattvaṃ nāma khyāpyatāmna tu tasya viṣayo nirūpyate /	It amounts to this that the mother-of-pearl conceals its own form, assumes the form of silver and presents itself to consciousness. The Naiyãyikas strongly deny that it is not an illustration of the presentation of the unreal.
tasmādyadevāsyāṃ cakāstitadeva rajatamasyā viṣaya iti yuktaṃ vaktum /	Then it is indeed a novel drama in which the mother-of-pearl plays the part of Sită.

Let us assume the suggestion of the Naiyáyikas and put this question to them.374 The refutation of the hypothesis that an unreal object is presented to consciousness Is the hypothesis of the presentation of the unreal a better one? Shall we accept it? No, it is also untenable since it does not stand the test of reasoning.
tatraiva bhūpradeśasya tathābhāvaprasaṅgataḥ //86//	What does the phrase the presentation of the unreal signify? Does it mean the aware- ness of an absolutely unreal object, i.

Or, does it mean the conscious- ness of an object which exists somewhere but is absent from the present locus? If the second alternative is accepted then the presentation of the unreal object amounts to the misapprehen- sion of the real object since the logicians who uphold the hypo- thesis of misapprehension admit that silver does not exist in the present context but exists somewhere in the real universe. But nobody experiences an object which is absolutely unreal.

Such a contention is not tenable since it is unreaso- nable to conjecture that the impressions of an unreal object remain stored up in our mind.
arthānubhavasamādito hi saṃskāro vāsanā kathyate /	The term vāsanā requires explanation. The impression which arises from the experience of a real object is called vāsanā.

Why does not the vasana which produces the knowledge of silver present the sky-lotus instead of it? How is it possible that the law of presentation is obeyed by visană? We should not discuss the problem regarding the nature of visani.

The event of consciousness which apprehends as subject, pro- jects itself as an external object and allows itself to be appre- hended as an object.

vijñānātmano hi pratibhāse [ahaṃ rajatam] iti pratītiḥ syātna [idaṃ rajatam] iti /	If consciousness plays the double role of the knower and the known then both the subject and the object are nothing but consciousness.

The hypothesis of the unreality of an object is also based upon a wrong assumption since no object is presented to our consciousness as unreal.
viparītakhyātāvapi rajatasya sannihitasya jñānajanakatvam ajanakasya ca pratibhāso neṣyata eva /	But it overdoes when it holds that the object which lies outside the field of perception and does not produce consciousness is presented to consciousness.
ataḥ tatra rajarajatasmṛtyupasthāpitaṃ rajatamavagatijanakamupagatam /	Thus the upholders of the hypothesis of misapprehension have accepted the suggestion that the object which is recalled in memory produces consciousness.
ataśca rajatasmṛtiraparihāryā /	Thus the remembrance of silver becomes unavoidable in order to explain the illusory judgment that this is silver.
sā ca rajatasmṛtirna tadā svena rūpeṇa prakāśate[smarāmi] iti pratyayābhāvāt //	The memory of silver does not ex- press itself in its true colour in the above judgment since the judgment does not assume the form of self-consciousness "I remember silver".
tasmāt pramuṣitāmenāṃ smṛtimicchanti tārkiṃkāḥ / abhyaste viṣaye liṅgapratibandhasmṛtiṃ yathā //93//	As the memory of silver and such other acts of memory assume an obscure form, so the logicians describe such indis- tinguishable memory as fading or indistinct or having lost its mark of distinction.
so 'yaṃ smṛtipramoṣaḥ tattvāgrahaṇaṃ akhyātirucyate //	The non-recognition of indistinct memory is called akhyati (the term has been explained as non-discrimination).
evaṃ satīyamakhyātiriṣyate sarvavādimiḥ / tathā prakaṭayadbhistu pītaṃ prābhākarairyaśaḥ //94//	Thus we see that all the contesting parties will not take an exception to the sense of akhyāti as described above. But the school of the Prabhākaras has eclipsed the fame of all other logicians having been able to give such meaning of the term as is accepted by all.

The reason be- Chind the question is this that 'this' refers to the substratum in front of us and reveals it in true character and though the pre- •dicate 'silver' is supplied by the unidentified, indistinct memory yet it is not possible to identify 'this' with 'silver' due to non- discrimination.
kintu tejasvitādiviparītaṃ dharmimātramavabhāsate / dharmasārupyācca tadānīṃ rajataṃ smaryate /	The yonder object, i.e., the substratum in question, is present- ed to our consciousness only as a shining one. Silver is recalled in our memory owing to the operation of the law of similarity since the shining object, now cognised, is similar to silver.

"The implication of this argument is that the judgment "This isNyayamanjari 378 silver" as interpreted by the Prabhakaras is inadmissible.

But we hold that the contradictory judgment does not reveal such distinction as has not been detected before. This' does never signify silver.

This is always this and silver is always silver. There is no exception to this rule. It has been stated by the contradictory judgment that this is something else and silver is something other than silver.

Such an objection does not hold good because the fact of remembrance is not determined by a single condition but by a plurality of such conditions.

Oh fool of consumed brain! Why do you not follow the Prabhākara argument though it is repeated to you again. and again?:380 The Prabhakaras hold that all cases of the so-called illusion are not explained in terms of the indistinct memory.

The awareness of this reveals only the non-specified substratum but not the piece of the mother-of-pearl. If the Prabhākaras subscribe to the above hypothesis, we feel the least hesitation to accept it. Let us now trace the growth of the judgment "This is silver".

The above general property is at the root of the presentation of the specific property. The judgment implies that what is this silver. Thus, it suggests iden- tity between this and silver.

How can a person who is in need of silver go for it unless he strongly believes that he has perceived silver? Therefore, it must be admitted that such a movement presupposes the perception of silver but not the indistinct memory of silver.

Similarly, when we behold the substratum before us we simply perceive its non-distinguishing general character such as its brightness but not its distinguishing feature. Then, we remember the characteristic feature of silver with the result that we misread the yonder object as silver.

It is really no explanation of the contradictory judgment. It is merely a play on words since it does not get the sanction of experience.

The Prabhākaras may contend that silver is remembered because it was experienced some time in the past. In that case silver is recalled in memory in accor- dance with the normal laws which govern the occurrence of memory.

Is this memory governed by a law? How is it that a particular incident among the experienced ones is recalled in memory only at a particular period of time to the exclusion of the other ones? How is it that all experienced incidents are not remembered at all times? 385 The Prabhakaras put some questions to the Naiyāyikas.

Now, the Prabhakaras may put a question to the Naiyãyikas "if the object is not experienced by you how do you know that it is real." The answer to this question is this that though an object may not be experienced by a person yet it may be experie- nced by somebody else and thus may be called as real.

The thesis of the Prabhakaras that the dream experience is representative by its nature but its representative character is not grasped by us should be thoroughly examined.

But one cannot hold that the whole of dream- experience consists only of memory which remains ever obscure. Thus the Prabhākaras hope against hope to establish the thesis that memory assumes a mutilated form so that it is not recognised.

The Prabhākaras may contend that when the eye-rays are divided into twain the single moon is not seen as such.

But Oh Vedic scholar, how shall we conceal the fact that the double vision of moon is illusory? Now, the Prabhākaras may contend that the eye-rays, being divided, have the number 'two, and the perceiver fails to grasp the said number as belonging to its.proper locus.

When we behold the single moon do we perceive that the rays of the eye are one? But it is a fact that nobody will perceive that the ray of the eye is one since the eye-ray itself remaining super- sensuous, reveals the object.

Moreover, they have explained the illusory judgment "Sugar is bitter" in terms of non-discrimination.

In the judgment "This is silver" the predicate 'silver' may be supplied either by apprehension or by the mutilated memory.

But in order to do it they have simply contradicted experience. The upholders of the hypothesis of misapprehension may put forward three alternative suggestions in order to justify their hypothesis.
nanuatra coditaṃ [asatkhyātireva sā bhavet] iti naitat sādhu /	But they have not been fairly refuted. Silver is the object which is revealed by the judgment "This is silver".

They hold that silver is not present there but if it is the object of the said judgment and is revealed by it then the judgment in ques- tion involves the presentation of an unreal object.

Again, if it does not produce percep- tion, how is it revealed by perception? Our answer to these ques- tions is as follows: Even if we have mal-observation of an ob- ject, it provokes the memory of another object similar to it.
na cāsyopasthāpanaṃ paśoriva rajavā saṃyamya ḍhaukanamapi tu hṛdaye parisphurato 'rthasya bahiravabhāsanam /	As an animal which is required at a spot is brought there with a noose tied round its neck so an object which is absent from a spot but is presented to our consciousness is not acquired to be physically present there.

The reason behind this statement is this that the object is perceived as distinct from the act of perception and that the presentation of an absolutely unreal object does never take place.

If it does not do then how is it referred to by the judgment "This is silver ?" We should not be laughed at if we say that we have witnessed the drama in which the mother-of-pearl plays the above part.

This view is held by some logicians of the Nyaya School.

A certain disease which is called 'timira' resides in the eye-ball and looks like a collection of loose hairs.

In other words, these three hypotheses interpenetrate one another and hence lack the mark of individual distinction. Of these three hypo- theses the two hypotheses, put forward by the Buddhists, viz., the hypothesis of the projection of consciousness and that of the presentation of an unreal object will be refuted in the chapter on Apavarga where the thesis of Subjective Idealism will be rejected.

Contradiction is such as sets at naught the resultant form of a knowing process. The judgment that the object which is being known is avoidable or acceptable is the resultant form of a knowing process. This point has been discussed in the section on the difinition of perception.

Now, a question may be put to us, viz., "How does a contra- dictory judgment dispense with the resultant form ?" An answer to this question is this :--- I If it completes its task while it sings or dances or repeats some sacred incantations or offers libation to fire then it requires no other intermediate process to realize its object. If it is held that an end is not directly attained and a chain of intermediate means awaits in the path which leads to the destination then how can we fix up the limit to such means? How do we pass on from one means to another? Another intervening means is required and so on ad infinitum In other words, if we admit that under no circumstances a goal is direct- ly reached then the fallacy of regressus ad infinitum will surely discredit the very assumption itself.
yathā ca na vartamānaikaviṣṭhā eva viṣayapratītayastathā kṣanabhaṅgambhṅge vakṣyāmaḥ //	In fine, we should not doubt the efficacy of the above hypothesis raising unimportant questions.

But such an objection is not fair. They have taken a wrong Contradiction is not applicable to view of contradiction. Contradiction is Reality, i.e., to the objects known by us.

There is no contradiction in the above judgment referring to the egated colour because the subsequent judgment comes into being without negating the prior judgment in question.

But it is reasonable to hold that the subsequent judgment contradicts the anteced- ent one since cancelling the former, the latter appears. More- over, the subsequent judgment alone contradicts the antecedent one since it correctly refers to the object of knowledge and is strengthened by some other proofs.

But such a mistake does not take place since there is some sort of silver which is presented to our consciousness like the true silver.

Or, does the difference in the nature of propositions, viz., positive and negative, con- stitute such a basis? Judgments do not supply us with the basis of the above division. Sometimes, we, also, come across the judgment that this is not silver.

It does not behove the Mimärsakas to deny the earth the character of an effect. Sabara has clearly stated that the true character of an object is revealed to us though we do not know its origin.

Even if we admit that the immovable objects are subjects of inference then the above generalization is not immune from an exception. The so-called subject of inference cannot but be either a positive or a negative example since an object cannot simultaneously have such two properties as are contradictory to each other. If the big trees are, in reality, created by a creator then they are posi- tive examples.

Whenever a doubt, viz; whether a consequence belongs to the subject of inference or not, arises in our mind, a syllogistic argument is put forward to solve it. But if the consequence is unknowable or unknown then we do not put forward a syllo- gistic argument.

Simil-Nyayamanjari arly, it is not reliable if it belongs to a doubtful negative exam- ple. It is doubtful whether a creeper has been created by a creator. Thus the combination of parts is not a true reason.

The Naiyäyikas may also say in reply that as the judgment that the earth and such other things have no creator is an impossibility so they should not be described as negative examples. Now, the Mimamsakas may point out that the creator of those objects is not perceived by any body.

As the existence of the said creator is inferred so the judgment that the creator does not exist does never appear in our mind. In the absence of such a judgment it is glaring mistake to assert that the earth and such other objects are contrary examples.

This ob- jection reveals only their superficial observation since such ab- sence of the probandum does not negate the truth of the inferen- tial knowledge, In other words, an inference of this type is not a fallacious one. Again, if a fallacy of this type is admitted then inference per se will be discredited. This very argument can be set against the inference of the auditory sense-organ, put forward by the objector.
iha tu sthāvarādau kartrabhāvaniścayo nāstītyuktam //	A dissimilar object being inferred, the probandum in question does not belong to the example.

But it should not be called as a contradictory one when it proves a particular type of proban- dum which is dissimilar to that of the probandum illustrated in the example.
kiñcitkālaṃ tasya pakṣatvaṃ yāvannirṇayo notpannaḥ / tadutpāde tu nūnaṃ sapakṣavipakṣayoranyataratrānupravekṣyatyasau /	The reason, employed in the above syllogism, does not prove that the earth and such other objects have not been created by a creator.

Therefore it is not a contradictory one. 416 Moreover, the reason in question does not illustrate the type of Kālātyaya Apadişța fallacy.

In some syllogisms the reason which is employed has no power to enlighten the intended probandum.

The reason necessarily implies the consequence.
tasmāt na viruddhaḥ // nāpi kālātyayāpadiṣṭaḥpratyakṣāgamayorbādhakayoradarśanāt /	Hence, there is no room for the contradiction of the syllogism in question and there is no chance of the appearance of an obstacle which will stand in the way of arriving at the conclusion.

In fine, we hold that the reason, viz., being an effect, put for- ward by us (as pointing to the existence of God), is not open to the charges which have been brought against it by our critics.
iha tu kāryatvaprayuktameva sakartṛkatvaṃ tatra tatropalabdhamiti / ata evānumānavirodhasyeṣṭavighātakṛtaśca na kaścidihāvasaraḥ /	Therefore, the existence of God is surely established on the strength of the sound reason indicated above. The truth of inference is admitted by all.

It is a truism that the human being like us cannot create earth, etc.

Similarly, we infer a distinct creator from a distinct effect.

A potter who has acquired proficiency in preparing various earthen objects such as a pitcher, etc., handles the materials in order to produce them on proper occasions. Similarly, God who is in the know of the processes of creating and destroying the universe where all creatures enjoy pleasure and pain can be the creator of the universe as he feels the necessity of creating and destroying it.

How are these shortcomings in the shape of love, hatred, etc. possible in God who has eternal, pure and serene consciousness? The reason behind the absence of these defects in God is this that they (defects) owe their origin to the wrong way of Thinking.

His consciousness which grasps all sorts of objects, past, future, subtle, enveloped, etc., admits of no diver- sity, since if He had several acts of awareness then they would have been neither simultaneous nor successive.

In that case, how can we distinguish one individual act of consciousness from another? His consciousness is said to be immediate because it bears a close resemblance to perceptual awareness. Though it resembles perception yet it is not produced by the sense-object-contact.
jñānavadanye 'pyātmaguṇā ye 'sya santite nityā eva manaśaṃyogānapekṣajanmatvāt /	The other attributes of the Supreme Soul are also eternal like His consciousness, since they are not conditioned by the contact of the internal organ with the soul.

bhāvanākhyena saṃskāreṇāpi na prayojanam sarvadā sarvārthadarśitvena smṛtyabhāvāt /	He is not in need of impressions which, being revived, develop into memory. He requires no memory because He has always, the direct know- ledge of all objects.

But it is qualified sometimes by an object, viz., the creation of the universe and at other times by another object, viz., the destruction of the universe.

The answer to the question from the standpoint of the Naiyāyikas is that incorporeal God creates this Universe. Now, a further question arises in our mind.
nanu kriyā ''veśanibandhanaṃ kartṛtvaṃna pāribhāṣikam /	Those who are associated with an action are real agents but those who are not so associat- ed are not agents.

Is agency found anywhere in an incorporeal being? One who has consciousness, will to do something and mental acti- vity is called an agent.

The reply to this objection from the Nyâya point of view is this :—"As the unconscious body obeys the will of the soul so the unconscious atoms will submit to His will.Incorporeality of God What is the motive of God behind the creation of this world?

But the same nature prompts Him again to destroy it at another period of time. Why does His nature manifest itself at regular intervals? If a person puts a question like this to us then we submit the following by way of reply. The person who raises.

Now, another objection arises in our mind that the simultane- -ous destruction of all objects of the universe cannot be reason- 423424 ably maintained. The residues of actions which have not borne fruits cannot be so obstructed that they remain impotent.

kathaṃ punaramī varṇāḥ śrutamātratirohitāḥ /	How are these letters eternal? Do they not pass away as soon as they are heard? How do you cherish the hope of establishing the hypothesis that the Vedas enjoy the absolute independence? (The Mimamsakas hold that sounds are eternal.
nityā bhavantuko 'yaṃ vā śabdasvātantryadohadaḥ //182//	The Vedas consisting of eternal sounds are also eternal.

pratyakṣam arthāpattiś ca nityatāṃ tvadhigacchataḥ //183//	The proposition that all effects are non-eternal admits of simple -conversion as the character of being an effect and non-etern- ality are two co-extensive terms and pervade each other.

A sound is an effect to be produced by our effort because it is experienced by us only when we make an effort so that the air within our body comes in contact with a particular part of our body and becomes separated from it.
uccāraṇādūrdhvamanupalabdheḥ anityaḥ śabdaḥ /	A sound is also destructible because it is not experienced after its pronuncia- tion.
karotiśabdavyapadeśācca kāryaḥ bdaḥ /	A sound is an effect because we use it as an object of the verb 'to make'.
[śabdaṃ kuru][śabdaṃ mā kārṣīḥ] iti vyavahartāraḥ prayuñjate /	Persons who make these expressions 'Make a sound', Do not make a sound', etc.

nānadeśeṣu ca yugapadupalambhāt teṣu teṣu deśeṣu śabdena vyavahārāt sarvatra yugapadupalabhyate śabdaḥ /	As the same sounds are simultaneously experienced in many places so they are effects. As they are produced in so many different places so they are localized in them.
śabdāntaravikāryatvāccānityaḥ śabdaḥ /	Again, a sound is non-eternal because a sound evolves from another sound.
dadhyatreti ikāra eva yakārībhavatīti sādṛśyāt smṛteścāvagamyate /	Let us take an example, viz., 'dadhyatra'.
vikāryatvācca drākṣekṣurasādivadanityatvamasyeti //	The semi-vowel 'y' is also subject to destruction because it is an evolute like the juice of grapes or that of sugar-cane.
kāraṇavṛddhyā ca vardhamānatvāt /	We also know that a sound is an effect because if there is an increase in the quantity of its cause then the effect, viz.

But when a few persons with less effort utter the word 'cow' the sound becomes very small. As greater is the number of threads so bigger is the size of a piece of cloth and as lesser is the number of threads so smaller is the size of a piece of cloth.

Similarly, we know that a sound is the effect of our effort.

As there is the possibility of the perception of a sound only when it is manifested by our effort so there is no hard and fast rule that a sound is an effect of effort since the latter precedes the former. The contact and the separation of the air with and from the certain inner parts help the manifestation of letters.

The use of the verb 'to make* is not decisive. It is sometimes loosely used.

Or when we ask somebody to cut a log of wood into long pieces of wood, we use the root kr (to make)in Sanskrit. We do not ask the person to produce some- thing.

The simultaneous perception of a sound in different dire- ctions is possible like that of the Sun even if the sound is one but not many.
tasmād anityatā 'siddhiḥ naivaṃ prāyair asādhanaiḥ / śabdasya nityatāyāṃ tu saiṣā 'rthāpattir iṣyate // śabdasyoccāraṇaṃ tāvad arthagatyartham iṣyate /	The hypothesis that the relation of causality holds between the two letters as one of them changes into another does not hold good since one is substituted by another. The word 'dadhi, ends in the vowel 'i' and retains its distinct form as long as there is no euphonic change.
na coccāritanaṣṭo 'yam arthaṃ gamayituṃ kṣamaḥ //	But the vowel 'i' does not change into 'y' as milk evolves sour milk.
sarveṣām avivādo 'tra śabdārthavyavahāriṇām /	The consonants of the 'c' group, the semi-vowel 'y' and 's' are all palatal.
yadavijñātasambandhaḥ śabdo nārthasya vācakaḥ // vedyamānaḥ sa sambandhaḥ sthavirasvyavahārataḥ /	The words, the objects denoted by them and the relation of significance hold- ing between them are eternal. The instructive work simply informs of the presence of these words, meanings, etc.

When the semi-vowel 'y' changes into 'i' we get the form "vidhyati' from the root 'vyadh'. Hence, the hypothesis that the causal relation exists among letters cannot be established. If a word which consists of letters is uttered either by a strong man having loud voice or by many then the constituent letters do not increase in number.
tataḥ kṣaṇāntare tam arthaṃ tena vṛddhenānīyamānam upalabhmāna evaṃ buddhyate ayam artho 'mutaś śabdād anenāvagata iti /	Thus, he himself makes "out the meaning of the whole sentence as he understands that the whole movement of this person ordered is based upon the thorough understanding of the words of the order.

He -comes to learn that the word 'cow' denoted the universal of •cowness or a concrete particular, i, e., an individual cow as a member of the cow-class or as qualified by the universal of cow- ness, as the Naiyãyikas suppose.

The proof behind the above statement is as follows: An exp- erienced person orders another experienced person with the following words 'Fetch a white cow'.

The person who has been ordered sets to work because the words, :spoken by the person who gives the order, constitute the spring of his action and because there has been no other condition which impels him to work.

If the relation of significance of one word is known to us and another word can convey its meaning then all words. should have communicated their meanings when the relation. of significance of only one word has been detected. Now, the upholders of the above hypothesis may also assume that when the speaker uses a word, he utters the word, fixes up. its meaning, communicates its meaning to others and teaches others to use the word correctly.
na caivam asti /	Such a hypothesis is not tenable.

tasmāt sādṛśyanibandhanārthapratītyanupapatteḥ gośabda eva sthāyītyabhyupagamanīyam //	Therefore, as a word does not carry a sense because it is similar to another word so the hypothesis that a word (viz. a cow) endures long (i. e.

śabdatvaṃ vyabhicāry atra gośabdatvaṃ tu dhurghaṭam //	The universal of smoke certainly exists. But the universal of all words is a wide common property.

(There- fore it is difficult to hold that the word 'cow' conveys its meanings through the medium of a universal belonging to the word 'cow', by means of successive letters which are not related to one another as its constituents? If the whole, i.e., the word 'cow' is not constituted then which locus does the universal of the word 'cow' belong to? It is a truism that the universal which belongs to the pieces of cloth does never belong to the threads, i, e., the constituents of a piece of cloth.
iha cāyam abhedapratyayo varṇaikyanibandhana eva na jātikṛtaḥ /	This alternative hypothesis is not434 also sound. The universals which are asserted to belong to the letters cannot be proved to be so.

If the elements which manifest a universal in a particular are clearly distinct from those in another particular then the existence of a universal is clearly proved since the particulars possess very vivid marks of difference.

When a child, an old man, a female and a parrot read a line the persons who listen to it recognize the difference in the speakers but do not recognize the differ- ence in the letters uttered.
tathā ca gargaḥ paṭhati māṭharaḥ paṭhatīty uccārayitṛbheda eva pratīyate amuṃ gaviśeṣam eṣa paṭhatīti nocāryamāṇabhedaḥ //	When Garga reads out a letter and Mathura does the same thing the speakers are only cognized to be different. We all experience that they are reading the same letter.

As the consonant 'g' essentially remains the same so the experience of identity is true and that of difference is untrue.
evaṃ hi kalpanā laghīyasī bhavati /	This hypothesis is also favoured by the economy of assumptions.
tasmān na nānāgakāravṛttigatvasāmānyaṃ nāma kiñcid asti //	In fine, there is no such universal of 'gatva' belonging to the particulars 'g', 'g', 'g', etc.
api ca gogurugohādau bhinnājupaśleṣakārita eva vyañjaneṣu buddhibhedaḥ paropādhir avadhāryate /	We add a word more to the above conclusion in order to give an exposition to our point of view that the consonant 'g' occurring in the words 'go', 'guru' and ""geha' appear to be different owing to its association with the different vowels.
so 'yam akṣv api paropādhir eva bhavitum arhati varṇāśritatvāt vyañjakabhedapratyayavad iti /	We also believe that a vowel may also be associated with the acci- dental properties. As the accidental elements are uniformly associated with all letters so the same vowel appears to be different like a consonant due to its association with the said nonessential element.
tasmāt gatvavat atvasāmānyam pai nāsti //	The universal, viz., ‘atva' does not belong to the vowel as 'a' as the universal 'gatva' does not really exist.
yat punaḥ aṣṭādādaśabhedaṃ avarṇakulam ucyate tadaupādhikam eva hrasvādīrghaplutaśvṛtavivṛtādibuddhīnāṃ dhyvanibhedānuvidhāyitvāt //	The eighteen- fold division of the vowel 'a' is based upon its accidental elements. The experience in the divisions of a vowel, viz., 'a' such as short, long and prolated follows from the difference in the nature of the sound itself.
vivṛtaḥ saṃvṛtād anyo na gakārād vakāravat /	As the semi-vowel 'v' is different from the consonant 'g' so the vowel 'a' which is mute is not different from the vowel 'a' which is sonant.
api tv akāra evāsau pratibhāti yathā tathā //	But the vowel 'a' is experienced to be the same in the midst of all the changing associations.

The length of the sound being not the property of the word itself how does it help to convey the meaning? The answer in this question is that it is like the speed of a horse.
yathā turagadehastho vegaḥ puṃso 'rthasiddhaye / paradharmo 'pi dīrghādir evaṃ tasyopakārakaḥ //	As the speed of a horse serves the purpose of a man who rides it so the property of sound which is not a letter helps the letter to convey its meaning.
itaś caitad akārasāmānyam anupapannam /	We cannot subscribe to the hypothesis that universal belongs to the vowel 'a'.
atvaṃ hi na dīrghaplutayor anugataṃ bhavati ātvaṃ na hrasvaplutayoḥ ātvaṃ na hrasvadīrghayor iti /	The long 'a' and the prolated 'a' do not share the universal of atva in common. The short vowel 'a' and the long vowel 'a' do not share the universal of atva in common.
tasmād ekatvād varṇānāṃ nāvāntarajātayaḥ saṃbhavati /	Hence, the vowels like a, i. u, etc. do not admit of difference so they do not possess universals.

If we do not assume that a word is eternal then we cannot explain the communication of meaning by a word. Thus, the proof of presumption is the source of the true knowledge of the eternality of a word.
anumānād anyathātvam arthāpatter na dṛśyate /	Some hold that presumption is not distinct inference.
tenānumānam apy etat prayoktuṃ na na śakyate //	But it is not true that we cannot put forward a syllogistic argument in support of our hypothesis.
tad idam ucyate śabdo dharmo nitya iti sādhyo dharma sambandhagrahaṇasāpekṣārthapratipādakatvāt dhūmādijātivat /	- The syllogism runs thus:- A word is eternal because it com- municates its meaning only when the relation of significance holding between it and its meaning is grasped.
tad idam uktaṃ nityatvaṃ tu syād darśanasya parārthatvāt iti /	He holds that a word is eternal because a word is uttered by a person in order to communicate its meaning to another person.
evaṃ sambandhagrahaṇāt prabhṛti ārthapratipater avasthitasya vināśahetvabhāvād ātmādivan nityatvam //	He remembers the relation of significance holding between it and the object denoted by it. Then he understands that the word conveys this meaning. The word persists until and unless the meaning is not communicated.
na hy ayam avayavavināśānnaśyati śabdaḥ niravayavatvāt /	It does not perish on the destruction of its parts because it has no parts.
tad eva katham iti cet ucyate svalpenāpi prayatnena yadi varṇaḥ prayujyate / yadi vā nānubhūyeta śakalo nānubhūyate //	How is it that it has no parts? Let us explain why it has no parts. If we put forth very little effort to pronounce a letter then it may be inaudible but never becomes partly inaudible.
sāvayave hi vastuni dvidhā avayavā dṛśyante ārabdhakāryāścānārabdhakāryāś ceti /	The parts which make up wholes admit of two kinds.

Have the parts which are supposed to produce a letter effectuated whole or not? we perceive threads which are parts of a piece of cloth.

nāpy aśrayavināśād vināśaḥ śabdasya ātmādivadanāśritatvāt /	We are not in a position to infer parts of a letter because there is no middle term.

It cannot be held that a letter is neither permanent nor impermanent since a third alternative is not possible.
tasmāt tirohito 'py āste yadi śabdaḥ kṣaṇāntaram / mṛtyor mukhādapakrāntaḥ punaḥ kenaiṣa hanyate //	Hence, if a letter disappears for some time and does not meet its destruction then on its reappearance nobody can destroy it.

aṣṭakṛtvo gośabda uccārita iti vadanti na tv aṣṭau gośabdā iti /tenaikatvam avagamyate /	Common people say that the word 'cow' has been eight times pronounced. But they do not hold that eight different words have been pronounced.
yo 'yaṃ kriyābhyāvṛttigaṇane vihitaḥ kṛtvasucpratyayaḥ sa kriyāvatām abhede bhavati /	When the repetition of an act is counted we use the suffix 'kṛtvasuc,' It is attached to a word when that on which the act of utterance rests is one and the same.

Some logicians hold that the recognition of a letter as same is due to similarity.

Thus all of them simultaneously hear alike all the sounds. If it is held that the object of hearing is improved upon, then a letter or a word, which is, according to the Mimāṁsakas,441 On the Nature of Letters partless and all-pervasive being improved upon, should be heard everywhere. The word 'cow' which has become manifest in Madras should also be heard in Kashmeir.
na hi tasyādhāradvārakaḥ saṃskāraḥ ākāśavadanāśritatvāt /	Such a contention is not tenable since the Mimāṁsakas hold that a letter or a word stands upon no locus.

More- over, if we subscribe to the hypothesis of manifestation then we can not maintain the distinction between the loud and the low sounds.
na hi śabdastīvro mando vā kaścit svatastasya bhedābhāvāt /	A letter is neither loud nor low since it admits of no intrinsic difference.
saṃskārasya ca tadabhivyaktihetoḥ na kācana tīvratā mandatā vā yadanusāreṇa viṣaye tathā buddhiḥ syāt //	The very act which manifests a letter has no such qualitative difference so that a letter may be presented to our consciousness as loud or low. The air which may be held to help its manifestation may be strong or gentle.

This sense-organ, being somewhat improved upon by the air, grasps.

tathā tadvāyusaṃyogavibhāgāḥ kecid eva naḥ / kasyacid grahaṇe śaktāḥ śrotraṃ kurvanti saṃskṛtam //	This organ which has been thus improved upon, being accompanied by a particular set of conjunctions and disjunctions of the air with and 'from certain portions of the mouth, grasps a particular letter.
yathā ca teṣām utpattau samarthyaniyamas tava / tathaivaiṣām abhivyaktau sāmarthyaniyamo mama //	As the Naiyāyikas hold that such conjunctions and disjunctions are able to produce letters so we, the Mimamsakas, hold that they are capable of manifesting letters.

They are also grasped only by the same sense-organ, viz., the nose. But our experience throws light on the fact that the smell, in different cases, is manifested: by the different manifestors.

Thus, deafness or the power of hearing is explained by means of principle of merit and demerit.
yad vā na tīvramandādeḥ varṇadharmatayā grahaḥ /	The Mīmāṁsakas do not subscribe to the view that the sky alone constitutes the organ of hearing.
buddhir eva tathodeti vyañakānuvidhāyinī //	(a definite set of well-defined conjunctions and disjunctions) exists.
tāvanta eva te varṇāḥ pracayāpacayaspṛśaḥ /	Likewise the letters either increase or decrease in volume.

marudbhir abhibhūyanto mārutā iva durbalāḥ / tejobhir iva dīptāṃśoḥ divā dīpaprabhādayaḥ //	A letter always remains to be the same.) As the dim light of a lamp is thrown into shade by the brilliant ray of the sun so the weak current of air is surpassed by the strong current of air.
dvayasaṃskārapakṣo 'py evaṃ samāhito bhavati ubhayeṣām api doṣāṇām utsāraṇāt /	Thus the above two hypotheses, viz., (1) an improvement is made upon the organ of hearing and (2) an improvement is made upon the letter are proved to be true since they are now freed from all defects.
tasmāt pratyabhijñāpratyayaprabhāvasiddhanityatvasya śabdasya abhivyakir eva sādhīyasī //	Hence, the hypothesis of the manifestation of a letter is better since a letter is proved to be eternal on the strength of recognition.

tathā hi bhavantaḥ vaiśeṣikāḥ saṃkhyāḥ jaināḥ saugatāś ca kāryaśabdavādinaḥ /	The Naiyayikas, the Vaišeșikas, the Samkhyists and the Buddhists subscribe to the hypothesis that a letter is an effect.

Thus a sound generates many similar sounds. They, on their turn, produce other similar sounds in a similar manner. Or, as a wave produces a series of waves so a sound produces a series of sounds. A sound which is last but one of the series arises in the sky confined within the ear-walls.
tad iyaṃ tāvad atighargharā kalpanā //	e. the limited sky. But such a conjecture simply provokes our laughter.
śabdaḥ śabdāntaraṃ sūta iti tāvad alaukikam /	The hypothesis that a sound produces another sound is a very uncommon one.
kāryakāraṇabhāvo hi na dṛṣṭas teṣu buddhivat //	A man of common sense fails to follow such a hypothesis. Two acts of consciousness are known to be causally connected.

How is it that a sound is veiled when the sky is partitioned by the walls, etc.? The inherent cause of a sound is the sky.
athāvaraṇātmakakuḍyādidravyasaṃyogarahitam ākāśaṃ śabdajnmani samavāyikāraṇam iṣyate tad atra pramānaṃ viśeṣe vaktavyam //	Now, the Vaišeṣikas may contend that the sky which has no contact with a wall which envelops it is the material cause of a sound. In that case, they should furnish us with sufficient proofs.
tulyārambhe ca tīvreṇa mandasya jananaṃ katham śrūyate cāntikāttīvraḥ śabdo mandas tu dūrataḥ // vīcīsantānatulyatvam api śabdeṣu durvacam /	Again, if a sound produces a similar sound then how is it that a faint sound produces a long sound? A near sound is heard to be loud but a distant one is heard to be faint.
yad apy ucyate sajātīyajanakaḥ śabdaḥ guṇātgāt rūpādivad iti tad idam asiddham asiddhena sādhyam guṇatvasyāsiddhatvāt //	Such an argument is baseless because the minor premise that a sound is an attribute involves the fallacy of material contradiction. It has not yet been established that a sound is an attribute.

dravyastha iva rūpādirato 'sya guṇatā kutaḥ // api ca na śabdāntarārambhakaḥ śabdo guṇatvāt rūpavat /	Therefore, how can a sound be an attribute? The main argument of the Vaiśeşikas that a sound produces another sound because it is an attribute like the attribute of -colour is opposed by the following counter-arguments.
śabdaṃ nārabhate śabdaḥ śabdatvāc chrotraśabdavat //	A sound -does not produce another sound because it is a soundlike the sound which is produced within the ear-hole.
na saṃyogavibhāvau śabdasya janakau saṃyogavibhāgatvāt anyasaṃyogavibhāgavad ityādayaḥ pratihetavo 'py atra sulabhā iti yat kiñcid etat //	Conjunction and discon- junction do not produce a sound because they possess the essence of conjunction and disjunction like the other conjunction and disjunction which do not produce sound. These counter- arguments are ready at hand.

It assumes the form of a sound. In other words, a sound imparts its form to the mode of the said organ. Thus the mode of the organ under- goes a change.
amūrtā ca śrotravṛttiḥ prasarantī na mūrtaiḥ kuḍyādibhir abhihantuṃ śakyata iti vyavahitasyāpi śabdasya śravaṇaṃ syāt //	Moreover, a sound which is produced in a partitioned area should also be heard since that mode of the organ of hearing which has no dimension cannot be obstructed by the partition walls when it goes out to reach the sound.

In that case, it is -co-extensive with the organ of hearing The organ of hearing is *very extensive. The mode of it should also be equally extensive. .In that case, do not we hear all sounds near or distant alike? The Arhatas (the Jainas) hold that a sound is a whole and is constituted by a number of minute particles.
tair gharṇo 'vayavī nāma janyate paśya kautukam //	Thus created, it proceeds from its place of origin towards the ears of a person.
teṣām adṛśyamānānāṃ kīdṛśo racanākramaḥ /	It is a very nice hypothesis stated by them.

Again, if it dashes against a tree then why is it not shattered into pieces? How long does such a weak letter move on to reach its destina- tion? When it enters the ear of a person how is it also heard by other persons? If it is held that it comes out from the ear of that person and goes into the ear of another person then how will the .Jainas explain the simultaneous hearing of a letter by many persons ? Now if the Jainas hold that many letters are simultaneously created by a speaker in accordance with the number of hearers then it will be pointed out that so many letters cannot be created by the single effort of a speaker.
śrotṛsaṃkhyānusāreṇa na nānāvaraṇasaṃbhavaḥ / vaktustulyaprayatnatvāt śrotṛbhedatadaikyayoḥ //	Almost all the Buddhists hold that a sound which is heard is. not related to the organ of hearing. The organ of hearing has. a peculiar power by means of which a sound is heard.

A. distinct sound is as unrelated to our organ of hearing as a sound in the close area is. But the Buddhists fail to explain why a distant sound is only heard to the exclusion of the second one..

There is a hard and fast rule to show that a single letter is only heard at a time. Again, recognition being a source of valid knowledge, one should hold that a letter is eternal.

Regarding this point, we, the Naiyāyikas, hold that the awareness of the said identity refers to a universal, e.g., gatva but not to a single letter, e.g.

If the Mīmāṁsakas urge that the different illuminators are only responsible for the appearance of difference then why is not it that the letters such as y, r, I, V, etc.

But if the different speakers, viz., a man, a he-parrot and a she-parrot pronounce the same letters then the Mimäṁ- sakas may point out that the letters are the same but appear to us to be different since the manifestors of the letters in these cases are different.

Specific difference is something other than general difference since here there is the knowledge of numerical difference.

Thus, the awareness of the distinguishing features is regarded as identical with the awareness of difference. Such a conclusion is not sound. The moments of actions like the act of walking etc.

Similarly, as each letter is marked by a distinct accent so letters are many, it is not proper to hold that consciousness is one and eternal but appears to be many as it comes in contact with many objects which are to beregard- ed as limiting adjuncts.

The Naiyāyikas review this criticism and point out that like the Buddhists, the Mīmāṁsakas should also deny existence to the universal of cowness since the common idea of cowness may presuppose the common property in the462 shape of capacity for performing the same acts such as carrying a load, milking etc.

The Naiyāyikas review the Mimāṁsā view and hold that if a person feeds five Brahmins at a time, another five Brahmins at another time and so on then does it mean that he has fed the same five Brahmíns five times? In a poem of a poet who displays an alliteration of the letter "g' many ga's are noticed.

Now, the Mimāṁsakas may contend that the above negative judgment points to the destruction (the non-existence) of the manifestation of a letter but not to that of a letter.
ata eva tirohite 'pi bhāvādiyaṃ apramāṇaṃ pratyabhijñety āhuḥ //	Therefore, let the judgment of recognition - be contradicted.
yady api dhriyate 'smākaṃ śabdo dvitrān api kṣaṇān / ptatyabhijñā tu kālena tāvatā nāvakalpate //	Let us take this judgment to be an erroneous one. Or, the Mīmāṁsakas may urge that there is no crucial evidence pointing to the destruction of a letter.
tathā hi śabda utpadyate tāvat /	In other words, the negative judgment may also be false.
tataḥ saṃskārabodhaḥ /	Such a criticism is not tenable.
tataḥ svaviṣayaṃ jñānaṃ janayati ajanakasya pratibhāsāyogāt / tataḥ tena jñānena śabdo gṛhyate /	The negative judgment that a letter does not exist is also strengthened by the judgment of otherness that this letter is not that letter.

In other words, the judgment of recognition presupposes the recollection of a letter for its very existence. But the negative judgment referring to the negation of a letter is not conditioned by such a recollection. Thus, of the two judgments about a letter only the judgment of recognition is invalidated by the negative one.
tad asat kāladairghyeṇa tadavasthityasaṃbhavāt /	Moreover, a judgment of recognition does not invariably point to the conclusion that the object recognized is eternal.

In other words, they mean to say that the evidence of percep- tion is final and as such a judgment of perception requires no corroboration.

A possible objection to the hypothesis is that the auditory perception of sound at a particular spot by a particular person cannot be explained.
yat tu pravṛddharabhasatayā buddhikarmādāv api nityatvasamarthanam tat atyantamalaukikam ity uktam // kiṃ nāma śabdanityatvasamarthanatṛṣā ''turaḥ /	They hold that if an impro- vement is made either upon the auditory sense-organ or upon sound (i.e., the letter which is heard) or upon both of them then the restricted perception of a letter is fairly explained.
tasmād alamatirabhasapravṛttābhiḥ buddhikarmādinityatvasamarthanakathābhiḥ //	The Naiyâyikas hold this explanation to severe criticism and point out that the Mimāṁsakas simply deceive people by the explana- tion.

There is no exception to this rule. But the Mimarsakas have taken an exception to this rule and pointed out that various} 468 accents, belonging to the same locus are manifested by the diffe- rent manifestor.

(In other words, the Naiyãyikas hold a brief for their hypothesis that each scent has a distinct locus).Mimāṁsaka view that Sound is manifested-refuted 469 Thus, the Naiyãyikas reassert the objections raised by them against the Mimamsa hypothesis of manifestation with greater force. As all the letters belong to one and the same locus so it cannot be held that a inct letter is manifested by a separate manifestor, If some Mimamsakas contend that an improvement may be made either upon the letter itself by means of the air or upon the auditory sense-organ or upon both even then they can- not surely maintain the required hypothesis that a distinct manifestor manifests a distinct letter.

The Mimāṁsakas should follow the teaching of the Vedas and hold that the auditory sense-organ is constituted by space but not by the sky. Such a hypothesis is not sound.
indriyasya hi saṃskāryasya saṃkāraḥ na saṃskāra evendriyam lokāgamaviruddhatvāt /	Space is the only source of knowledge of spatial proximity or remoteness. It has got no other function to do.

But a thinker who attaches too much importance to himself assumes that space constitutes the auditory sense- organ. The hypothesis that all the sense-organs are elemental will be proved later on. Space is not an element.

A reply to his contention is this that as Time and the Soul are equally all-pervasive so they might have as well cons- tituted the auditory sense-organ. Now, the Mîmāṁsakas may defend their position with the remark that Time and the Soul do not constitute sense-organs since they have got some other functions to do.
āgamas tvanyapara eva /	They will simply say that the same logic applies to Space.
yathā hi sūryaṃ cakṣurgamayatāt / diśaḥśrotram iti paṭhyate evaṃ antarikṣamasum iti ca paṭhyata eva /	As the Vedic sentences "Let the eyes be united with the sun, and let the ears be united with the space" run so the Vedic text "Let the vital breath be united with the sky" is also real.

The sky, enclosed by the ear-drum, etc., consti- tutes the auditory sense-organ. We enjoy pleasure or pain, derived from words.
nanu dharmādharmakṛtaśrotraniyamavat abhivyaktiniyamo 'pi śabdasya tatkṛta eva bhaviṣyati /	Now, the Mimåmsakas may turn up and contend in the following manner: As the Naiyãyikas hold that the restriction is imposed upon words by the invisible principle of merit and demerit so the manifestation of sounds will be determined by the same princi- ple.
kim iti tadaniyamo nityatvapakṣe codyata iti naitad yuktam cakṣurādīndriyāṇāṃ vaikalyaṃ adṛṣṭanibandhanaṃ andhakāraprabhṛtiṣu dṛśyate na punaḥ padārthasthitir aṣṭavaśāt viparivartate /	They hold that sense-organs such as eyes, etc., are not capable of grasping some possible objects and this incapacity is due to the agency of the invisible principle of merit and demerit. It is for this reason that the eyes cannot perceive darkness. But the nature of objects does never change.
vyañjakadharmātikrame hi himam api śaityaṃ svadharmam atikrāmet /	A cold object e.g. ice does never change its nature of being cold.

For, let us now see whether the property of being loud or that of being low belongs to a letter or to the air.
tīvratādayo hi varṇadharmā vā syuḥ dhvanidharmā vā varṇadharmatve tīvrāt gakārāt anyatvaṃmandasyetyasmanmatānupraveśaḥ //	Now, if the Mīmāṁsakas hold that the said properties belong to a letter then they should admit that a letter which is loudly pronounced is distinct from that which is lowly pronounced.
dhvanidharmatvapakṣe tu śrotreṇa grahaṇaṃ katham na hi vāyugato vegaḥ śravaṇenopalabhyate //	In that case, they subscribe to the hypothesis of the Naiyāyikas, Now, if the Mimāṁsakas hold that the said properties be- long to the air then the Naiyāyikas ask, "How are the properties of being loud and low heard by us?" The reason behind this objection is this that the property of the air can never be heard.
yat tu vyaktidharmāḥ kṛśatvasthūlatvādayaḥ jātāv upalabhyante iti darśitam tat kāmam upapadyetāpi / jāteḥ vyakteḥ taddhiarmāṇāṃ ca samānendriyagrāhyatvāt //	They have illustrated that the properties of an in- dividual, viz., fatness, thinness, etc., are attributed to the uni- versal which inheres in the individual. The example, shown by them is highly probable since the universal, the individual and the property of an individual are sensed by the same sense- organ.
iha tu sparśanagrāhyaḥ pavano 'tīndriyo 'tha vā /	But, in the present context, the air is either sensed by the organ of touch (according to the Naiyãyikas) or super- sensuous (according to the Vaišeşikas).

The Mimariisakas subscribe to an alternative hypothesis that the property of being loud or low belongs to consciousness.
kiñ ca nityaparokṣā te buddhir evaṃ ca nādavat /	But it is absolutely unreasonable to hold such a hypothesis.
tadagrahe na tīvrāditaddharmagrahasaṃbhavaḥ //	Thus, the said property has no chance of being perceived.
aho tīvrādayas tīvre prāpāte patitā amī /	The property of being loud or low has been carried away by the terrible storm.

yaścābhibhavavṛttāntaḥ tvanmate marutām asau /	It inheres in such an object as transcends our sense-perception.
anile cābhibhūte 'pi śabdo na śrūyate katham // dīpe 'bhibhūte raviṇā na hi rūpaṃ na gṛhyate /	The Mimāṁsakas may contend that if the air which mani- fests a particular letter is suppressed by some other air which manifests another letter then the letter is not heard.

yat tu śāṅkhādiśabdānāṃ śrotragrāhyatvasiddhaye / śabdatvaṃ tatra tadgrāhyaṃ ity avādi tad apy asat //	In order to explain that the sound, manifested by the playing on conch-shell, is somehow heard the Mimāṁsakas hold that the universal which belongs to the sound is heard but not the sound itself. The hypothesis is not sound.
satyaṃ vadata dṛṣṭaṃ vā śrutaṃ vā kvacid īdṛśam /	Have you ever seen or heard that if an object is imperceptible then its common property is perceived ?" Again, the Mimāṁsakas hold that every sound is articulate.
āśrayasya prokṣatve tatsāmānyopalambhanam // śabdo na te 'sty avarṇātmā na śaṅkho varṇasambhavaḥ /	According to the Mimāṁsakas the universal of sound- ness belongs only to the articulate sound (i.e., to letters). The inarticulate sound of a conch-shell does not possess the uni- versal.

The hypothesis that a sound is created obeys better the Law of parsimony than the other one that a sound is manifested There are two rival hypotheses about a letter. According toNyayamanjari one a letter is created. According to the other a letter is mani- fested.
yadi maulapramāṇena sādhitā nityaśabdatā /	But if its impermanence is proved then their hypothesis is wrong.

And as such it cannot drive away the external air which stands still. Again, even if the air outside blows gently, no word will be heard since though the air outside blows gently yet how can it be driven away by the inner air, being itself stronger than the internal air? The Mimāṁsakas may contend that some other kind of the imperceptible external air envelops a word but the perceptible air which causes the Syâma grass (a species of grass) to dance does not hide it.
yaṃ ca sūkṣmā api vāyavaḥ tirodadhati taṃ sutarāṃ balīyāṃso 'pi vivṛṇuyuriti yat kiñcid etat //	Even if it is admitted that such an imperceptible air exists and conceals a word then the more powerful air will be in a posi- tion to conceal it with greater facility.

The Vedas are the work of a person Thus we have proved that all letters partake of the character of an effect.

Thus the authorship of a person with regard to words, sentences, etc., is established.

Let us cite a few Vedic sentences, viz. Śanno devira- bhiṣṭaye, etc., and examine them. Each of these sentences is an orderly arrangement of words containing accents properly distributed and other signs of arrangement.
nāpi viruddhaḥ kartṛpūrvakatvavati sapakṣe kumārasambhavādau racanātvasya vidyamānatvāt //	The reason in question is not contradictorily related to the major term since it belongs to the positive instances such as the epic Kumāra-sambhava.

One cannot reasonably take action upon the words of the Vedas if the author of the Vedas is not remembered by him just as one cannot attach any importance to a mutilated book containing poems of great and small poets. In any case the author should be recollected.

The implication of this argument is that the Vedas are eternal. Now, they advance another reason "being a work the author of which is not remembered". Let this reason be accepted.

Or, do they intend to counteract the reason "be- ing an arrangement of words", put forward by us? It is not logi- cal to hold that a syllogistic argument supersedes another such argument. It cannot be proved that like perception and verbal testimony an inference sets aside another inference.
na hi tulyabalayoḥ anumānayoḥ bādhyabādhakabhāvaḥ tulyavalatvād eva /	If two syllogistic arguments are equal in strength then they will con- tradict each other because of their equal strength.
atulyabalatve tu yatkṛtaṃ anyatarasya daubalyaṃ tata eva tadaprāmāṇyasiddheḥ kim anumānabādhayā tadviḍambanārthaṃ tadabhidhānam iti cet tad apy ayuktam /	If they are of unequal strength then that which makes an argument weak will also invalidate it. In that case it is superflous to assume that an inference is set aside by another inference.
ekatra dharmiṇi yugapaditaretaravirodhidharmadvayaprayojakahetudvayopanipātāyogāt /	The two reasons which point to the two properties contradictorily opposed to each other cannot be simultaneously applied to the same sub- stratum-the subject of inference.
na hi dvyātmakāni vastūni bhavtum arhanti ity avaśyam anyataraḥ tatrāprayojakahetuḥ /	All the objects of the world can- not have two such parts as remain incompatible with each other.
aprayojakatvād eva tasyāgamakatve kiṃ viḍambanārthena hetvantareṇa prayuktena /	As it fallacious so it cannot draw the conclusion, which is expected of it. Therefore, no purpose will be served if the opponents put forward a reason to cancel another reason.
viruddhāvyabhicāry api nāma na kaścid dhetvābhāsa iti vaksyāmaḥ //	There is no such fallacy as is called "Viruddha-avyabhicări".

But the fallacy of Prakaraṇa- sama takes place if the reason which is really a source of doubt, the marks of its distinction remaining unobserved, is advanced.
tasmāt parodīr itaṃ hetuṃ nirācikīrṣatā vādinā tadgatapakṣavṛtitādidharmaparīkṣaṇe manaḥ khedanīyam /	Hence, if one intends to find fault with the reason advanced by his rival then he should take the trouble of examining whether or not the said reason belongs to the subject of inference, i.e.
na hi pratihetvanveṣiṇā vṛthā 'ṭāṭyā kartavyā //	He should not make wild conjectures to find out the counter-reason.
nanu kataradanayoḥ sādhanayor aprayojakaṃ racanātvāt asmaryamāṇakartṛkatvād iti ca ucyate racanātvam eva prayojakam / na hi puruṣam antareṇa kvacid akṣaravināsa iṣṭavya //	Now, let us see which of the above two reasons fails to draw the conclusion. The two reasons are as follows:- (1) being an arrangement of words and (2) being that the author of which is not remembered.
bho bhagavantaḥ sambhyāḥ kvedaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ kva vā śrutaṃ loke /	The decision on this point is this.
yadvākyeṣu padānāṃ racanā naisargikī bhavati // yadi svabhāvikī vede padānāṃ racanā bhavet /	The reason "being an arrangement of words" is competent to draw the conclusion since nobody has ever seen that the words arrange themselves without being arranged by a person.
paṭe hi hanta tantūnāṃ kathaṃ naisargikī na sā // śanno devīr abhiṣṭaye nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtya asty uttarasyāṃ diśi devatātmā iti tulye racanātve kvacit kartṛpūrvakatvaṃ aparatra tadviparyaya iti mahān vyāmohaḥ /	Oh revered sirs: Oh great men who move in the circle of experienced persons ! have you ever seen or heard in this world that the words in a sentence combine themselves by their in- herent power? If it is held that the words contained in the Vedas get themselves combined by their innate nature then why do not the threads which make up a cloth spontaneously combine themselves? In the sentences, viz., "San no devīrabhiştaye", "Nārāyaṇam namaskṛtya", "Astyuttarasyāṁ diši devatātmā" etc., the arrangement of words is the same.
evaṃ hi dhūmo 'pi kaścit anagnika ity api syāt //	Those who indulge in such a conjec- ture should have also held that smoke is sometimes produced by fire and that it is not also sometimes produced by fire.

Alas the Naiyāyikas, the foremost be- lievers, have established the authority of the Vedas !"On the authorship of the Vedas "No need of derision", "Say the Naiyãyikas in reply to the above remarks. The Vedas resemble the epic 'Kumāra-sambhava' only in the arrangement of words but in nothing else.

kim asya śabdatvasāmānyaṃ śaṅkhaśabdasādhāraṇaṃ nāsti sattāsāmānyaṃ vā sarvasādhāraṇam iti // nanu yāḥ kālidāsādiracanāḥ kartṛpūrvikāḥ /	Does not soundness belong to the Vedas alike as it does to the sound produced by conch-shell? Does not existence inhere in the Vedas as it does in all the ob- jects? The works of the poets like Kālidāsa etc.
tebhyo vilakṣaṇaiveyaṃ racanā bhāti vaidkī //	bear the stamp of their author on their face. But the Vedic works are entirely different from them.
ihādhyayanavelāyāṃ rūpād eva pratīyate /	There are uses of words, verbs, prepositions etc.
akṛtrimatvaṃ vedasya bhedais tais tair ananyagaiḥ //	in the Vedic literature. But there is much novelty in their use.
nāmākhyātoopasargādiprayogagatayo navāḥ / stutinindāpurākalpaparakṛtyādigītayaḥ //	The Vedic works contain laudation, condemnation, the story narrated by a single person, the story narrated by two or more persons and other matters not to be found in Classical Sanskrit Literature.
śākhāntaroktasāpekṣavikṣiptārthopavarṇanā / ityādayo na dṛśyante laukike sannibandhane // tenādhyetṛgaṇāḥ sarve rūpāt vedam akṛtṛmam /	Such a diversity of forms and mat- ters is not to be found in Classical Sanskrit literature. Thus, the students of Vedic Literature form their opinion from its uncommon character about the Vedas that the Vedic works have not been composed by an author.
manyanta eva loke tu pītaṃ mīmāṃsakair yaśaḥ //	Therefore, the Mimāmsakas drink the cup of glory in this world.
kāryatvaṃ bruvate te 'sya racanāsāmyamohitāḥ //	We, the Naiyāyikas, join issue with the Mimāṁsakas and refute their hypothesis.
ucyate mīmāṃsakāḥ yaśaḥ pibantu payo va pibantu buddhijāḍyāpanayanāya brāhmīghṛtaṃ vā pibantu vedas tu puruṣapraṇīta eva nātra bhrāntiḥ //	Let the Mīmāṁsakas drink the cup of glory or a cup of milk or medicated clarified butter in order to remove the dullness of their intellect. But there is no mistake in our hypothesis that the Vedas have been composed by an author.
yathā ghaṭādisaṃsthānāt bhinnam apy acalādiṣu /	The combination of parts of a jar is different from that of parts of a mountain.
saṃsthānaṃ kartṛmat siddhaṃ vede 'pi racanā tathā // yac cātra kiñcid vaktavyaṃ tat pūrvam eva savistaramuktam //	Still the combination of parts is due to the activity of an agent, i.e., it presupposes the existence of a per- son who combines the parts. Similarly, the arrangement of words, etc., in the Vedas is different from that of words etc.
api ca yadvilakṣaṇeyaṃ racanā tadvilakṣaṇa eva kartā 'numīyatām na punas tadapalāpo yuktam //	Though the arrangement is different yet there is no doubt about the fact that it is due to the activity of an author.492 We have got something to say regarding this matter.
yāścaitāḥ nirvivādasiddhakartṛkāḥ kālidāsādiracanāḥ camatkāriṇyaḥ tāsāmanyonyavisadṛśaṃ rūpam upalabhyata eva //	Nobody disputes to admit that the great works of Kālidāsa and other great poets which have an aesthetic appeal have been composed by an author. It is also experienced that each of these works has its distinctive mark.
amṛteneva saṃsiktāḥ candaneneva carcitāḥ / candrāṃśubhir avonmṛṣṭāḥ kālidāsasya sūktayaḥ //	The poetic expressions of Kälidāsa are as if dipped by nectar, besmeared by sandal paste and polished by the moonbeams.
prakaṭarasānuguṇavikaṭākṣararacanācamatkāritasakalakavikulāḥ vāṇasya vācaḥ /	Though the sentences of Bāņa Bhaṭṭa consist of long compounds yet they have charmed the circle of poets, rousing emotions as they do.
pratikāvyaṃ ca tāni tāni vaicitryāṇi dṛśyanta eva /	Similarly, in each literary work some diversities are noticed.
nāmākhyātādivaicitryamātreṇa kartrabhāvo vede rūpād eva pratīyata iti nūtaneyaṃ vācoyuktiḥ //	The very nature of the Vedas suggests that the Vedas have no author because nouns, verbs etc., have been strangely used in them. It is indeed a novel argument which has merely verbal significance.
api ca yadi rūpe samāśvasiti bhavato manaḥ tadā ādimadarthābhidhānam api vedasya rūpaṃ kathaṃ na parīkṣase babaraḥ prāvāhaṇirakāmayata kusurabinda auddālakirakāmayata purūravo mā prapataḥ iti //	If you have implicit confidence in the characteristic feature of the Vedas then why do you not apply your attention to examine the other characteristic feature of them, viz., the narra- tion of the created objects? The Vedic sentences which involve references to the created objects run thus:-"Babara, the son of Pravahaņa desired", "Kusura Vinda, the son of Uddâlaka, desir- ed, Oh Pūruravas! do not give up your life" etc.
pratisargaṃ punas teṣāṃ bhāvān anāditvam iti cet pratisargaṃ tarhi vedānyatvam api bhviṣyati /	Hence they are eternal in this sense. Then, the Naiyáyikas may as well say that the Vedas are different in each emergence of the new world.
yathoktam pratimanvantaraṃ caiṣā śrutir anyā 'bhidhīyate iti /	It has been stated that after the expiry of each Manu era the fresh Vedas are composed.
rūpād akṛtrimattve ca kalpanā kalpitaiva sā / ādimadvastubuddhis tu vācakair akṣaraiḥ sphuṭaiḥ //	If we frame the hypothesis that the Vedas are eternal seeing the characteristic features of the Vedas then the said hypothe- sis is only based upon pure imagination but is not established by a proof.
teṣāṃ anyathāvyākhyānaṃ tu vyākhyānam eva /	If we try to explain away the created objects mentioned in the Vedas then the explanation is not reliable.
paṭhanta eva tv adhyetāraḥ tata ādimato 'rthān bahūn avagacchantīti nānādirvedaḥ /	The students of Vedic literature in course of its study come across many terms which denote created objects.
tasmān na racanātavm aprayojakam //	Therefore, the Vedas are not eternal.
kartrasmaraṇam eva tvaprayojakam asiddhatvāt / siddham api vā vede kartrasmaraṇam anyathāsiddham /	But the counter-reason 'non-remembrance of an author' is incapable of drawing the conclusion since it has not been proved that the author of the Vedas is not remembered.

As the author of the Vedas is distinct from all other persons so he has no definite body. Consequently, nobody can remember Him as that particular person who has composed the Vedas as we do remember Păņini or Pingala as an author of a particular work. It is not true that God does not exist since inferential and verbal knowledge point to His existence.
sarvapuruṣasambandhi tu duravagamam /	The reason in question is definitely subjective.
sarve pumāṃsaḥ kartāraṃ vedasya na smarantīti kathaṃ jānāti bhavan na hi tava sakalalokahṛdayāni pratyakṣāṇi sarvajñatvaprasaṅgāt / na ca yat tvaṃ na jānāsi tat anyo 'pi na jānātīti yuktam atiprasaṅgāt /	It is impossible for all persons to determine whether or not the reason in question belongs to the subject of inference. How do you know that all persons do not remember the author of the Vedas? You do not intuit the mind of all persons. If you had done so you would have been omniscient. You cannot arrive at a generalisation based upon an analogical argument, viz.
tasmād asmaryamānakartṛkatvaṃ durbādham eva //	Therefore the reason "Being that the author of which is not remembered" is truly unknowable.
api ca kartur smaraṇe sati sutarāṃ vedārthānuṣṭhānaṃ prekṣāvatāṃ śithilībhavet / na hy akartṛka evopadeśaḥ saṃbhavati /	Again, if we do not remember the author of the Vedas then the zeal for performing the Vedic rites on the part of the intelligent persons will gradually fade away since an advice without an advisor is impossible.
saṃbhann api vā prāmāṇyaniścayanimittābhāvāt kathaṃ visraṃbhabhūmir asau bhavet /	Even if we admit that such an advice is a possibility then we cannot place our confi- dence in it since the source of its validity has not been deter- mined.
bādhakābhāvamatrāc ca prāmāṇyaniścayo vacasām ity uktaṃ prak /	We have stated before that 493494 Nyāyamanjari the truth of a sentence is not asserted if it does not merely involve self-contradiction.
tasmāt āptapratyayād eva nirvicikitsaṃ vedārthānuṣṭhānaṃ sapratiṣṭhānaṃ saṃbhavati nānyatheti / tasmān na kartrasmaraṇasya racanātvapratipakṣatayopanyāsaḥ upapannaḥ //	Thus the non- remembrance of an author cannot be logically taken as a counter-reason of being an arrangement of words. The said reason advanced by the Mimamsakas does not independently prove that the author of the Vedas does not exist.
anupalabdhir iyam anena prakāreṇa kilocyate / sā 'nupapanā anumānena kartur upalambhāt /	It really amounts to the non-apprehension of the author of the Vedas. Such a view is not tenable since the author of the Vedas is an inference.
anumānenāpi yadupabdhaṃ tadupalabdham eva bhavati //	What is inferred is also known.
nanu kartrabhāvasmaranab adhitvāt anumānam idaṃ ayuktam itaretarāśrayaprasaṅgāt anulabdhau siddhāyāṃ anumānanirāsaḥ anumānanirāse ca sati anupalabdhisiddhiḥ // anumānaprāmāṇye 'pi samāno doṣa iti cet na tasya pratibandham ahimnā prāmāṇyasiddheḥ /	The Mimāṁsakas may contend that the inferential knowledge of the author of the Vedas is not logically tenable because it has been contradicted by the non-remembrance of the author of the Vedas. But such a contention is a glaring instance of vicious circle since if the said non-remembrance is established then the said inference is contradicted and if the said inference is con- tradicted then the said non-remembrance is established. The Mīmāṁsakas may point out that the establishment of the truth of the said inference suffers from the same defect.
na hi tasyānupalabdhinirāsāpekṣaṃ prāmāṇyam // attretat syāt na vayaṃ kartrabhāve prāmāṇyaṃ brūmaḥ /	The truth of the said inference does not depend upon the contradiction of the truth of the said non- remembrance. The Mimāṁsakas say that the above reason does not directly prove the absence of authorship of the Vedas.
paraṃ tu vedasya pauruṣeyatāṃ bruvāṇaṃ pramāṇaṃ pṛcchāmaḥ /	They ask their opponents to furnish them with the proof with regard to the hypothesis that the Vedas have been composed by a person.
tccāsya nāstīti balād anupalabdhyā tadabhāvaniścayo vyavatiṣṭhata iti syād etad evam yady anumānaṃ na syāt /	As the opponents cannot supply with such a proof so non-remembrance enforces on our mind its resultant know- ledge that the author of the Vedas does not exist. The Naiyã- yikas say in reply to this argument that such a conclusion might have been accepted if there had been no inference.
uktaṃ ca racanātvāt ity anumānam //	We have already stated that the Vedas have an author because they possess an arrangement of words.
yat punar avādi vedeṣu puruṣasya kartṛtvam aśakyaṃ grahītum iti tad apy asādhu parokṣasya kuvindāder abhinavaprāvarakapaṭādau kārye kathaṃ kartṛtā 'vagamyate paṭādiracanāṃ dṛṣṭvā tasya cet sā 'numīyate /	The Mimamsakas have said that the origin of the Vedas can- not be traced to a person. Such a statement is not fair. WhenOn the authorship of the Vedas we perceive a new curtain, etc. how do we determine the exis- tence of a weaver who is beyond the ken of our vision ? We infer the existence of a weaver who has made a cloth, etc.
vede 'pi racanāṃ dṛṣṭvā kartṛtvaṃ tasya gamyatām //	from the object which has been created by him.
śarīraparigraham antareṇa prāṇinām upadeśasya kartum aśakyatvāt kadācidīśvaraḥ śarīram api gṛhṇīyād iti kalpyate /	Similarly, we infer the existence of the author of the Vedas from the arrange- ment of words contained in them (the Vedas). A soul cannot advise others if he does not possess a body. Hence we can assume that God sometimes has a body.
niyataśarīraparigrahābhāvāc ca vyāsādivadasau na smaryate /	As He has no permanent body so He is not remembered like the other authors, viz., Vyasa etc.
tataś ca adya sadyaḥ kaviḥ kāvye yathā karteti mīyate / tathā tatkālajaiḥ puṃbhiḥ so 'pi karteti māsyate //	As a poet who belongs to our age is known as the author of a particular poem by his contemporary fellows so God will also be known as the author of the Vedas by his contemporary fellows.
yathā parakṛtā śaṅkā tasmin kāvye vyapaiti te / vede 'py anyakṛtā śaṅkā tathā teṣāṃ vyapaiṣayti //	495 As the misapprehension regarding the poem that it has been composed by some body else but not by the said poet is remov- ed so the erroneous knowledge about the authorship of the Vedas will be also dispelled.
parokṣam anumānena yac ca budhyāmahe vayam / pratyakṣaṃ yogināṃ tac cety uktaṃ pratyakṣalakṣaṇe //	It has been stated in connection with the definition of per- ception that a transcendental object which is inferred by us is perceived by the sages.
pratyakṣam anumānaṃ ca tad evaṃ kartṛtāmitau /	I memory is held to be the source of such knowledge then it has the chance of being discredited.
mūlapramānam astīti smṛtau nāndhapraṃparā //	The Mimāṁsakas have stated that the hypothesis of the Naiyāyikas involves circular reasoning.
yathoditānumānādipramāṇāntarasaṃbhavāt // yad api itaretarāśrayamabhāpi puruṣokte vedepramāṇyaṃ vedaprāmāṇyāt puruṣasiddhir iti tad api na samyak pūrvaṃ parihṛtatvāt /	The Vedas are the source of true knowledge because they have been composed by omniscient God and God exists because the Vedas point to His existence. But the critics misrepresent the hypothesis of the Naiyāyikas. The objection raised by them, is not fair. The Naiyāyikas have given an answer to this charge at an earlier496 Nyāyamanjari section.
anumānāt prasiddhe kartri vedavākyaiḥ tatpratīter upodvalanamipyate na tv āgamaikaśaraṇa eva kartravagamaḥ /	The Vedas simply strengthen the said conclusion. The Naiyãyikas do not hold that the Vedas are the only source of God, the creator of the universe.
uktaṃ ca pūrvam api pṛthivyādinā kāryena kartur anumānam //	It has been stated before that the crea- tor of the universe is inferred from the earth, etc.-the created objects.
kiṃ yenaiva kartrā pṛthivyādikāryaṃ nirmitaṃ tenaiva vaidikyo racanā nirmitāḥ iti cet om ity cyate / kim antra pramāṇam iti cet ucyate tarhi sarvajñaḥ sraṣṭuṃ prabhavatīdṛśam /	The author of the Vedas is the creator of the earth and such other objects Does the creator who has fashioned this earth compose the Vedas? If this question is put to us then we answer this ques- tion with the remark "Oh yes". Now the opponents may urge "What is your proof?" Our answer to this question is as follows: Omniscient.
vicitraṃ prāṇibhṛtkarmaphalabhogāśrayaṃ jagat // tatkarmaphalasambandhavidā tadupadeśinaḥ /	God is competent to construct such a huge universe full of diversities a universe where the different sorts of beings enjoy the fruits of their action.
tenaiva vedā gcitāḥ iti nānyasya kalpanā //	Hence we assume that nobody but God composes the Vedas.
ekenaiva ca siddhe 'rthe dvitīyaṃ kalpyema kim anekakalpanābījaṃ na hi kiñcana vidyate //	If the assumption of a single person serves our purpose then why shall we assume a second person as the author of the Vedas? We find no sufficient reason for assuming many persons, entrusted with the different functions.
jagatsarge tāvat eka eveśvara iṣyate na dvau vahavo vā /	No purpose is served if we hold that there are two or more creators of the universe. Suppose there are two Gods.
bhinnābhinnāśayakalpane ekatravaiyarthāt / itaratra vyavahāravaiśasaprasaṅgena tata ekasyeśvaratvavighātāt /	Now, if their will is concordant then one of them is redundant. Again if their will is discordant then one of them is sure to undermine the work of the other creator.
tathā hi anekeśvaravādo hi nātīva hṛdayaṅgamaḥ / te cet sadṛśasaṅkalpāḥ ko 'rthao bahubhirīśvaraiḥ //	The hypothesis of the plurality of Gods is not at all satisfac- tory. If the will of many gods is perfectly concordant then the hypothesis of the plurality of gods is absolutely meaningless.
saṃkalpayati yadekaḥ śubham aśubhaṃ vā 'pi satyasaṅkalpaḥ /	He whose will is inviolable makes up his mind to reward or to punish a being.
tatsidhyati tadvibhavāt ity aparas tatra kiṃ kuryāt // bhinnābhiprāyatāyāṃ tu kāryavipratiṣedhataḥ /	What He desires turns out to be true by meansOn the authorship of the Vedas 497 of His majesty. How can the other Gods help in this matter of inflicting punishment or awarding a reward? Let us assume many gods.
nūnam ekaḥ svasaṅkalpavihatyā 'nīśvaro bhavet //	If their will is discordant then two opposite wills cannot simultaneously materialise.
ekasya kila saṅkalpaḥ rājāyaṃ kriyatām iti / hanyatām iti cānyasya tau samāviśataḥ katham // rājyasaṅkalpasāphalye vihatā vadhakāmanā / tasyāḥ saphalatāyāṃ vā rājyasaṅkalpaviplavaḥ //	If one God desires that a particular person shall be a king and another God desires that he shall be killed then how can these two conflicting desires simultaneously take an effect? If the first desire of making one a king is fruitful then the second one of killing him will be frustrated.
tena citrajagatkāryasaṃvāhānuguṇāśayaḥ / eka eveśvaraḥ sraṣṭā jagatām iti sādhitam // evaṃ jagatsargavat sa eva vedānām apy ekaḥ praṇetā bhavitum arhati /	Thus we have established that there is only one God who creates the universe full of diversity. All the Vedas have been composed by one and the same author As the creator of the universe full of diversity is one so the author of all the Vedas is God who is one.
tena yad ucyate nanv ekaḥ sarvaśākhānāṃ kartetyavagataṃ kutaḥ bahuvo bahubhir granthāḥ kathaṃ na racitā ime //	No proof can be put forward in support of the hypothesis that many gods have written the Vedas. The assumption of many gods simply violates the law of parsimony.
iti tatparihṛtaṃ bhavati //	Now, an objection is raised against this hypothesis.
ataś ca ekakartṛkā vedāḥ yataḥ parasparavyaktiṣaktārthāpadeśino dṛśyante /	All the Vedas have the same author because the same well- connected subject-matter has been taught in all the Vedas.
ekam eva hi karma vedacatuṣṭayopadiṣṭaiḥ pṛthagbhūtair apy ekārthasamavāyibhir aṅgaiḥ anvitaṃ prayujate /	As all these accessory rites contribute towards the completion of the princi- (To perform pal rite so they are held to be connected with it. any Vedic rite the assistance of the four different priests is absolutely necessary.
tatra hi hautraṃ ṛgvedena yajurvedenādhyvaryavaṃ audgātraṃ sāmavedena brahmatvam atharvavedena ca kriyate /	The priests discharge the duties of an adhvaryu-priest in accordance with the Yajur Veda. The priests execute the duties of an udgătṛ according to the Sama- Veda. The priests complete the duties of a brahmå according to the Atharva-Veda.
pauṣpalādiśakhābhedopadiṣṭāṃ ca tattadaṅgajātaṃ tatra tatrāpekṣyate /	The subsidiary actions which have been stated in the different recensions of the Vedas such as Paippala etc., are necessarily implied for the completion of the main action.
tatra sarvaśākhāpratyayaṃ ekaṃ karmety āhuḥ /	They say that all the minor actions, taught by the different recensions of the Vedas, point to one and the same main action.
etac ca adūra eva agre nirṇeṣayte //	We shall decide this matter at subsequent section not far off.
ekābhiprāyabaddhatvaṃ tena sarvatra gamyate / bhaved bhinnāśayānāṃ hi katham ekārthamīlanam // kāvyasamasyāpūraṇe kā vartā iti cet tatrāpi prathamasyaiva kaves tadvastudarśanāt /	As the subject-matter of Vedic literature indicates that it represents an inter-related system united by a common purpose so how can the Vedic literature be composed by the different persons having cross-purposes? If this is the argument of the Naiyãyikas then how is it that a foot of a verse is composed by a single poet and the other feet are composed by the other poets? (The main point in this objection is this that a single poem represents a whole the different parts of which are composed by the different poets.
tadabhiprāyavedī tu so 'nyastam anuvartate //	In spite of the diversity of authors the poem maintains the unity of an idea.
anyathā 'nanvitaṃ kāvyaṃ syād viśvavasukāvyāvat / anvitatve tu sā nūnaṃ ādyasyaiva kaver matiḥ //	Otherwise if the idea of some portion of a poem composed by a poet does not agree with that of the other portions of the same poem then it becomes an incongruous poem like the literary product of Viśva Vasu.
ihāpy ekāśayābhijñadvitīyeśvarakalpane / ekābhiprāyataiva syāt kiṃ ca tatkalpane phalam //	Now, in case of the Vedas if we hold that there are other gods who follow the intention of the first god then the intention of one god constitutes the key-note of the Vedas and there is no need of assuming other gods.
tasmād eka eva kartā sarvaśākhānām /	Thus, we arriveRelation between a Word and its Meaning 499 at the conclusion that God is the author of all the different recensions of the Vedas.
kāṭhakādivyapadeśas tu prakṛṣṭādhyayananibandhano bhaviṣyatīti bhavadbhir apy uktam //	The opponents also admit that the naming of the different recensions such a Kathaka, etc. may have been after the name of the celebrated teachers of the particular subject.

All leaves, flowers and fruits do not belong to a single branch. But they belong to a few branches. Similarly, the Vedas which teach the details of the subsidiary rites branch off in different recensions.
tāsāṃ ca vṛkṣaśākhānāṃ ekasmāj janmabījataḥ / tathaiva sarvaśākhānāṃ ekasmāt puruṣottamāt //	As all those branches of a tree develop from a single tree so the origin of all the recensions of the Vedas is traced to God, the best of all persons.
kartā ya eva jagatām akhilātmavṛttikarmaprapañcaparipākavicitratājñaḥ /	The creator of the universe who has immediate knowledge of merits and demerits of each soul and of the various degree of their maturity has given a code of instructions which has universal applications.

All persons pin their faith in the words of the Vedas because they believe that the Vedas have been composed by eternal and trustworthy God who is possessed of all excellent virtues.
teṣām akrtṛkatayā na hi kaścid evaṃ visrambhameti matimāniti varṇitaṃ prāk //	No intelligent person will place his confidence in the veracity of the Vedas because they have been composed by no author. We have discussed this point at an earlier section.

They strongly assert that a word has an innate power of conveying an object just as the power of burning is inherent in fire. A person simply learns that this word has the power of conveying this object from the use of an experienced old man.

The relation holding between a word and its meaning is not that of conjunction which obtains between a plum and a small reservoir of water.
tanmūlatvā ca sambandhāntarāṇy api na santi /	No other relations which are based upon any one of these two relations are also possible.

When we utter the words "razor, a sweet ball, etc." neither we experience a cut in our mouth by a razor nor the filling up of our mouth by a sweet ball.

The rejoinder of the Naiyãyikas is that this relation is a conventional one. The Mimâmsakas question, "What is a convention?" The Naiyāyikas answer that convention is an act of will which determines that this word will denote this object. In other words, a relation between a word and an object is fashioned by an act of will.
sa hi puruṣakṛtaḥ saṅketaḥ /	Such a relation is called a conventional one.
na ca puruṣecchayā vastuniyamo 'vakalpate tadicchāyā avyāhataprasaratvāt //	Such a view is not tenable since the convention is set up by a human being and no law is imposed upon the external objects by the mere will of a person.

A word conveys its meaning by means of this power. It does not communicate its meaning by means of its conventional relation. The Mimāṁsakas contend that a convention is nothing but the determination of a particular relation holding between a word and an object meant by it.

Or, does He frame it once for all persons in the beginning of this world? Even if it is admitt- ed that the said convention is repeatedly created for each per- son then does the convention which is repeatedly set up become a new one or remain the old one at all instances of utterance? If it is held that a new convention is set up each time then how do we know that a convention helps to communicate the meaning of a word? If the power of communication is transcen- dental then what is the good of setting up a new convention? That which has been done before is being done again.

How does the word 'horse' mean an animal having manes? If the relation is held to be one and the same then the relation which has been created cannot be re- created.
sargādāv api sakṛtsambandhakaranam ayuktam tathāvidhakālāsambhavād eva / na hi śabdārthavyavahārarahitaḥ kaścit kāla upapadyate /	The Naiyāyikas may hold that the relation between a word and its meaning has been once created by God in the beginning of the creation of the world. Such a contention is not sound. It is highly improbable to imagine such a period of time since it is illogical to cherish a be- lief in the existence of an age when there is no verbal transac- tion.
tasmān nityasyaiva sambandhasya lokato vyutpattiḥ na punaḥ karaṇam //	Thus we arrive at the conclusion that the relation holding between a word and its meaning is eternal and is learnt from the people.
vyutpattipakṣaṃ ca na karaṇapakṣābhihitā doṣāḥ spṛśanti pratyakṣasiddhatvāt / pratyakṣaṃ hīdam upalabhyate /	But the said relation cannot be created. The defect which undermines the hypothesis that the relation is created does not affect the hypothesis that the eternal relation is learnt since the second one is based upon sound reasoning.

These experienced old persons were also young. They learnt the meanings of words from the other old persons. These old persons learnt it from the other old persons at their young age and so on ad infinitum.

In that case, a word will be as good as the lashings of a whip or piercing with a hook or beating with a sharp instrument.

If we subscribe to the hypothesis that a convention determines the meaning of a word then all words would be reduced to the state of arbitrary ones, coined by us just like the word 'Yadṛcchã'.
tena gavāśvādiśabdānāṃ niyataviṣayatvaṃ na syāt //	If we go so far as to accept this hypothesis then the words like cow, horse, etc., will have no definite meaning.

yathā coraśabdastaskaravacanaḥ odane dākṣiṇānyaiḥ prayujyate /	The word 'caura' signifies a thief. It has been employed by the people of the southern countries to denote rice.

If the said relation were eternal then such a change in the meaning of a word would have not been possible.
ata eva cānavagatasambandhe śrute sati sandeho bhavati kam arthaṃ pratyāyayitum anenāyaṃ śabdaḥ prayuktaḥ syāt iti /	Again if we hold that a word has no power of expressing its meaning then, on hearing a word, no doubt as to its meaning should arise in our mind since a con- ventional relation has not been established between it and its meaning.

It is unreasonable to hold that the relation between a word and its meaning is eternal.
nanu śaktirūpaḥ sambandha ity uktam /	This being the nature of this power it has only a dependant existence.

Such a contention does not hold good since the existence of a subtle power apart from a cause and its auxiliary conditions has been refuted.
na ca śaktiḥ pratyakṣagamyāḥ dravyasvarūpavad anupalambhāt /	This power is not perceptible since it is not cognized like a substance.
nānumeyā kāryāṇām anyathā 'pi ghaṭamānatvāt /	It is not also an inference. It is a truism that a cause is inferred from an effect.
kalpayitvā ca śaktiṃ aparihāryaḥ asmayaḥ samayam antareṇārthapratipatter asiddheḥ /	Thus the assumption of an eternal relation becomes redun- dant. Now the Mimāṁsakas raise an objection against the hypo- thesis of conventional relation.

Such an objection is not reasonable. If the hypo- thesis that a word has the power of expressing a meaning is denied then can a word be competent to denote a meaning? Now, the Mimāṁsakas raise another question, viz., "If the power of expressing a meaning is denied to a word then how is a word competent to signify a meaning?" An answer to it is as follows.
gatvautvādisamānyasambandho hi yasya bhavati sa vācakatve yogya iti itaras tu vācyatve /	The word 'ga' which contains the universals such as gatva, autva, etc., in proper succession is entitled to be deno- tative. But the object which is meant by it is expressible.
yathā dravyatvādyaviśeṣe 'pi vīranatvādisāmānyavatāṃ kaṭaniṣpattau tantutvādisāmānyavatāṃ ca paṭanippattau /	A Viraņa (a kind of grass) is a substance. There are also substances which do not belong to the class of Viraņa. Of all substances Viraņas alone produce a mat because the universal of viraṇatva inheres in them.
na ca tatra śaktir astīty uktam /	It has been stated that the power of producing an effect does not belong to it.

In other words, the object which is named will never play the part of a name. Therefore, the relation which holds between a word and the object denoted by it is other than the power of expression.
na ca tayor avinābhāvo dhūmāgnyor iva sambandhaḥ /	The said relation is not that of universal concomitance holding between smoke and fire.
tatra hi sambandhaḥ pratīyamānaḥ evaṃ pratīyate dhūmo 'gniṃ vinā na bhavati iti /	Whenever the relation of universal concomitance holding between smoke and fire is cognized we also know that smoke does not exist at a spot where fire is absent.
iha punaḥ ayam asmāt pratīyate iti /	But whenever the relation of denotation holding between a word and its meaning is apprehended we also come to know that this object is known from this word.
etāvateva vyutpativarvasānam /	This is the final lesson on the relation of denotation which we learn from experience.
ata eva avagatipūrvikaivāvagatir ihetyanumānāt śabdasya meda uktaḥ // prakāśakatvam api śabdasya samayaprasādopanatamegha na svābhāvikam / sāṃsiddhike hi tathātve bhramitvādiprayuktāt anyato vā yataḥ kutaś cit abhinavād api dīpād iva śabdād arthapratītiḥ syāt //	We have already stated that verbal knowledge is different from the inferential one because the former one pre-supposes the knowledge of the relation of denotation. There would be no doubt about the truth of the hypothesis that a word reveals an object by its power innate in it, if the word is not uttered either by a mistake or negligence it reveals the intended object just as a lamp illuminates an object.
yat tu naisargikie 'pi prakāśakatve śabdasya dhūmāder iva jñāpakatvāt sambandhagrahaṇasāpekṣatvam uktam sa eṣa viṣama upanyāsaḥ /	The Mîmāmsakas hold that though the power of revealing an object is innate in a word yet the word reveals its meaning only when the relation between them like that between smoke and fire is known.
na hi dhūmādeḥ pratyāyakatvaṃ svābhāvikam analāvinābhāvitvaṃ tu tasya nijjaṃ balam /	Smoke has no inherent power of revealing fire though it is by nature an inva- riable concomitant of fire.
tatra cāgṛhyate tasmin pratītir eva na jāyate iti yuktaṃ tadgrahaṇaṃ pratītyartham /	Thus if such relation obtaining between smoke and fire is not known the knowledge of fire does not follow from the perception of smoke.
iha tu pratītiśaktir eva svabhāvikī bhavatā 'bhyupagamyate /	But the Mîmām- sakas assume that a word has an inborn power of revealing its meaning.
sā cet svābhāvikī kiṃ vyutpattyaekṣaṇena iti //	If this power is natural then why should verbal knowledge depend upon the relation of denotation holding 507508 between a word and its meaning.
yadi cocyate pratyāyaka iti pratyayaṃ dṛṣṭvā 'vagacchāmaḥ na prathamaśravaṇa iti /	The Mīmāṁsakas say "We know a word to be a revealer only when we understand that a word produces knowledge. But we fail to make out this charac- ter of a word only on hearing it".
yāvat kṛtvaḥ śrutena iyaṃ saṃjñā ayaṃ saṃjñī ity avagamyate tāvat kṛtvaḥśrutād arthāvagama iti so 'yaṃ samayopayoga eva kathito bhavati /	As many times as we hear a word and know that this is a name and this is the object named so many times we make out the meaning of a word heard by us. Thus the efficacy of the relation of denotation has been stated by it.
saṃjñāsaṃjñisambandho hi samaya evocyate / tad upayogam antareṇa pratyāyakatvānavagamāt na svābhāvikī śaktiḥ //	The Mimāṁsakas have taken an exception to the hypothesis of the Naiyāyikas on the ground that a conventional relation partaking of the nature of consciousness, belongs to the soul but does neither belong to a word nor to an object meant by it.
yat tv abhyadhāyi samayasya jñānātmakatvāt ātmani vṛttiḥ na śabdārthayor iti etad apy acatruaśram tadāśrayatvābhāve 'pi jñānasya tadviṣayatvopapatteḥ //	Though consciousness does not find a locus in them (a word and its meaning) yet they may be related to it as an object. The Mīmāmsakas have criticised the hypothesis of the Naiya- yikas thus: If a word communicates its meaning only by means of its conventional relation then a word will be better in no way than the piercing of a hook or the lashings of a whip. It that case, a word is redundant.
yad apy abhāṇi samayamātraśaraṇe sṛṇipratodanodananirviśeṣe śabde śabdārthaṃ pratipadyāmaha iti vyapadeśaḥ na syād iti tad api yat kiñcit / naisargikaśaktipakṣe 'pi śakter arthaṃ paratipadyāmahe na śabdāt iti vyapadeśaḥ syāt / avinābhāvād aginiṃ pratipadyāmahe na dhūmāt iti syāt /	If the power of conveying a power in itself conveys a meaning, why does not the word do? If the power of conveying a meaning were inherent in a word then we should have held that the power itself conveys a meaning but not the word. If the Mimamsakas argue that the power is merely a condition of conveying a meaning whereas a word is the cause of such con- veying then the Naiyãyikas will also simply meet the objection with the remark that the same logic applies to the hypothesis of the Naiyãyikas.
tadaṅgatvād avinābhāvādeḥ na tathā vyapadeśa iti cet tad itaratrapi samānam //	In other words, a word is the cause of com- municating its meaning but the conventional relation is merely the condition of such communication.
dhūme hi vyāptipūrvatvaṃ śabde samayapūrvatā /	As smoke depends upon the knowledge of universal concomi- tance in order to indicate fire so a word depends upon the knowledge of the relation of denotation in order to communi- cate its meaning.
nānayos tad apekṣāyāṃ karaṇatvaṃ vihanyate // api ca laukiko vyapadeśaḥ samayapakṣasākṣitām eva bhajate /	In spite of this dependence none of them (smoke and a word) ceases to be a cause.Relation between a Word and its Meaning not eternal Moreover, popular usage bears an evidence to the truth of the hypothesis of conventional relation e.g.
devadattenoktaṃ amutaḥ śabdād anu arthaṃ pratipadyasveti ity evaṃ hi vyapadeśati lokaḥ /	Devadatta has said 'Learn this meaning from this word'. An ordinary person talks like this.
tasyāt samaya eva // ataś caivaṃ deśāntare saṅketavaśena tata eva śabdād arthāntarapratipattiḥ //	Therefore, the hypothesis of conventional relation should be accepted. It is the conventional relation which alone explains why a particular word conveys a different meaning in another country.
nanu atroktaṃ sarve śabdāḥ sarvārthapratyāyanaśaktiyuktā iti kenacid arthena kvacidvyavahāra iti tad etad ayuktam śaktīnāṃ bhedābhedavikalpānupapatteḥ / na śabdasvarūpāt bhinnāḥ śaktayaḥ tathā 'navabhāsāt /	509 The Mimāṁsakas hold that each word is capable of conveying all sorts of meanings. In different countries some words are restricted to particular meanings by usage. Such a hypothesis does not convince one that a word communicates its meaning since the dilemma whether or not a word is identical with its meaning cannot be solved.
avyatireke ca ekasmācchabdādananyatvāt parasparam avyatirekastāsāṃ syāt /	If we admit that the said power is identical with a word then all the different powers belonging to a word should also be identical.
na ca bhinnakāryānumeyā bhinnāḥ śaktayaḥ kāryabhedasyānyathā 'py upapatteḥ /	Now, the Mimāṁsakas may contend that the different powers are inferred from the different effects. Such a contention is not tenable.
sarvaśaktiyoge ca sarvārthapratyayaprasaṅgaḥ /	How can one account for the diversity of effects as due to the difference in powers? The variety of effects may also be otherwise explained.
samayopayogo niyāmaka iti cet sa evāstu kiṃ śaktibhiḥ yad apy agādi śabdaśaravaṇe sati sarvārthaviṣayasandehadarśanāt sarvatra tasya śaktiḥ kalpyata iti tad apy asāram na hi śaktikṛtaḥ sandehaḥ kin tu gatvādivarṇasamānyanibandhanaḥ / tathā ca gatvādijātimatāṃ varṇānāṃ arthe vācakatvam avagatam /	If it is held that all words are capable of conveying all meanings than a word should communicate different meanings. The Mimamsakas may contend that though each word admits of different meanings yet a word is restricted to a particular meaning by means of conventional relation. That is why a word does not simultane- ously convey all meanings. If this is the contention of the Mimāṁsakas then the hypothesis of power inherent in a word should yield place to that of conventional relation.
amī tajjātiyogino varṇāḥ kasyārthasya vācakāḥ syuḥ iti bhavati sandehaḥ // yat punar avādi sa eva śabdasyārthaḥ yatrainam āryāḥ prayuñjata na mlecchajanaprasiddha iti tad etat katham iva śapatham anatreṇa pratipadyemahi /	The Mimämisakas hold that when a word is heard the listener is at a loss to ascertain the exact meaning since many meanings flash in his mind. Such a doubtful state of mind leads one to assume that a word has various powers. Such a view is not sound since many powers inhering in a word cannot explain the above doubt. The above doubt arises in one's mind because universals belonging to letters, the constituents of a word, play an important part.

It signifies a meaning. But if none of its constituents conveys a meaning then how can a word, an aggregate of letters having no meaning, convey a meaning? This question, remaining unsolved in our mind, raises the above doubt. The Mimāṁsakas have also said that the meaning of a word is that which is conveyed by it used by the Aryans but the meaning of a word which has been accepted by the non-Aryans is not a real one.
aveṣṭyadhikaraṇe rājaśabdaṃ āndhraprasiddhe 'rthe varṇitavanto bhavanta iti alam avāntaracintatena /	In other words, the thesis is not based upon sound logic. It is not a fact that a word which has a peculiar meaning in the non-Aryan country communicated no meaning.
sargādau sakṛd eva samayakaranam iti na pakṣaḥ //	It is not a truism that the meaning of a word which has been accepted by the non-Aryans is contradicted.
ata eva na sarvaśabdānāṃ yadṛcchātulyatvam / keṣāñcid eva śabdānāṃ asmādibhir adyatve saṅketakaraṇāt tata eva yadṛcchāśabdā ucyante /	It is also not true that the meaning of a word, accepted by them, produces doubt in the mind of the people. Why will the meaning be not a real one? The Mimāṁsakas may argue that the meaning of a word current in the Aryan country contradicts its meaning, current in the non-Aryan country. Then we ask them "Why does not the latter contra- dict the former ?" In order to solve the above difficulty we shall rather hold that some words like the word "akşa" admit of alternative meanings.
sargādiśca samarthita eva /	In other words, the scope of each of the alternative meanings will be well defined and fixed up.
īśvarasiddhāvapyavikalam anumānam upanyastam //	We shall refrain from discus- sing minor details. Let us turn our attention to the point at issue.
adyatve tu śabdārthasambandhavyutpattau tulya evāvayoḥ panthāḥ /	The relation of denotation i.e., the relation holding between a word and its meaning, is constituted by convention.
tathā ceyam iyatī vyutpattiḥ loke dṛśyate yat ayam asya vācyaḥ ayam asya vācaka iti na punaḥ śaktiparyantā vyutpattir asti /	It may mean something else.Relation between a Word and its Meaning not eternal The Mimamsakas take an exception to our hypothesis on the ground that whenever a person utters a word he establishes each time a new convention.
tathā hi yatra śṛṅgagrāhikaya śabdam arthaṃ ca nirdiśya sambandhaḥ kriyate tatreyantam evainaṃ kriyamāṇaṃ paśyāmaḥ ayam asya vācyaḥ ayam asya vācaka iti //	We hold that God has created a convention once for all in the beginning of creation. The meaning of all words has not been arbitrarily determined like the word 'yadṛcchâ'. The meanings of some words have been fixed up by us accor- ding to our sweet will. These words bear a close resemblance to the word 'yadṛcchã'.
yatrāpi ca vṛddhebhyaḥ vyavaharamāṇebhyaḥ vyutpadyate tatrāpīyadevāsau jānāti ayam arthaḥ amutaḥ śabdāt anena pratiapnna iti na tv anyā asya kācicchaktir astīti /	But you hold that not only the relation of denotation is ascertained but also the power of expression inherent in a word. We hold that the relation of denotation is exclusively grasped. As a meaning is conveyed by this word, this is a denotative word but no information about the innate power of a word has been received.
iyatyaiva ca vyutpattyā śabdād arthapratyayopapatteḥ asyāścāparihāryatvāt adhikakalpanābījābhāvāc ca na nityaḥ śabdārthaśambandhaḥ //	The knowledge of the relation of denotation, being the invariable condition of verbal knowledge, we are not justified in assuming the inherent power of a word. Hence, the relation holding between a word and its meaning is not eternal.
ata eva ca sambandhaḥ tripramāṇakaḥ iti yat tvayocyate tad asmābhir na mṛṣyate /	Therefore, the thesis of the Mimāṁsakas that the denotative relation is esta- blished by three kinds of proof is not accepted by the Naiya- yikas.
śabdavṛddhābhidheyāṃś ca pratyakṣeṇātra paśyati iti satyam /	It is also true that a listener rightly infers from the move- ment of the experienced person who has been employed that he has obeyed the command of his employer.
anyathā 'nupapattyā tu vetti śaktiṃ dvayātmikām ity etat tu na satyam anyatha 'py yupapatter ity uktatvāt tasmāt dvipramāṇakaḥ sambandhaniścayaḥ na tripramāṇakaḥ //	But it is not true that the power of expression which rests upon a word and its meaning is a presumption. We have already stated that the knowledge of the power of expression is not necessary for the communication of the meaning of a word. Therefore, the determination of the relation of denotation is due to two kinds of proof but not three.
tad evaṃ śabdasya naisargikaśaktyātmakasambandhābhāvāt īśvaraviracitasamayanibandhanaḥ śabdārthavyavahārah nānādiḥ //	Therefore, as a word has no innate power of expression and lacks eternal relation to its meaning so the verbal usage has been introduced by God who has established a relation between a word and its meaning by His sweet will.
nanu īśvara 'pi sambandhaṃ kurvan avaśyaṃ kenacit śabdena karoti tasya kena kṛtaḥ sambandhaḥ śabdāntareṇ cet tasyāpi kena kṛtaḥ tasyāpi kena iti na kaścid avadhiḥ /	If God sets up the relation between a word and its meaning and commu- nicates it to men then He does it by means of sentences. These sentences consist of words. These words should also be signi- ficant. How are they known to be related to meaning? if they are so related then how is their meaning communicated to others by means of a different set of words? The meaning of these words is not known to persons whom God teaches.
tasmād avaśyam anena sambandhaṃ krvatā vṛddhavyavahārasiddhāḥ kecit akṛtasambandhā eva śabdā abnhypagantavyāḥ /	Hence if we hold that God has connected words with their meanings then there will be a regressus ad infinitum to communicate the meaning of a word by means of a never-ending series of sen- tences consisting of words of unknown meanings.
asti cet vyavahārasiddhiḥ kim īśvareṇa kiṃ vātatkṛtena samayena ity ānādipakṣa eva śreyāt ucyate astramāyuṣmatā jñātaṃ viṣayas tu na lakṣitaḥ /	If a word is known to be significant by means of usage then what is the good of admitting the existence of God or of admitting the relation of denotation as created by God? Thus, the hypothesis that the relation of denotation is eternal is better.
asmadādiṣu doṣo 'yaṃ īśvare tu na yujyate //	But they do not apply to God, the omniscient being.
nānākarmaphalasthānaṃ icchayaivedṛśaṃ jagat / sraṣṭuṃ prabhavatas tasya kauśalaṃ ko vikalpayet //	God who has created the infinite universe by His mere will for the fruition of the diverse unre- quitted actions has superexcellent skill in teaching which lies beyond the ken of our imagination.
icchāmātreṇa pṛthivyāder iyataḥ kāryasya karaṇasmadādīnāṃ yanmanorathapadavīm api nādhirohati tad api yataḥ saṃpadyate tasya kiyānayaṃ prayāsaḥ /	Our imagination fails to conceive of the creation of this Earth and such other objects by a mere act of will. God does so. Therefore it is not at all difficult for God to create the relation of denotation and to communicate it.
tad atreśvarasadbhāve paraṃ vipratipattayaḥ /	There may be counter- arguments which disprove the existence of God.
tasmiṃs tu siddhe ka evaṃ vikalpānām avasaraḥ uktaṃ ca tatiddhau nirapavādam anumānam /	If the existence of God is once established then the counter-arguments regarding the relation of denotation have no scope. We have already put the existence of prove forward irrefutable arguments which God.
vayaṃ tu na kartāra eva sambandhasya yata evam anuyujyemahi //	As we do not create the relation of denotation so we should not be taken to task. Men like us, i.
aṅgusyagreṇa nirdiśya kañcidarthaṃ puraḥsthitam / vyutpādayanto dṛśyate bālānasmadvidhā api //	e., imperfect beings having limited knowledge, initiate little boys into words, their meanings and their mutual relation by pointing their finger-ends to the yonder objects.
tasmāt īśvaraviracitasambandhādhigamopāyabhūtavṛddhavyavahāralabdhatadvyutpattisāpekṣaḥ śabdaḥ artham avagamayatīti siddham //	Hence, the verbal transactions of the old persons constitute the means of throwing light upon the relation of denotation introduced by God. Thus when one learns the relation of denota- tion noticing the transaction of the experienced persons he understands the meaning of words, i. e., these words communi- cate these ideas.
na ca nityasambandhābhāve 'pi śabdasyārthāsaṃsparśitvaṃ samayabalenārthapratyayasyābādhitasya siddher ity uktatvādityalaṃ vistareṇa //	Though the relation between a word and an object denoted by it is not eternal yet the former does not remain unrelated to the latter. On the strength of the relation of denotation set up by God the uncontradicted knowledge of the meaning of a word follows from a word.
tasmāt pade ca vākye ca sambandhe ca svatantratā / puruṣasyopapanneti vedānāṃ tatpraṇītatā //	Therefore, as it is reasonable to hold that God has created the relation of denotation which subsists between a word and its meaning and between a sentence and its meaning so the hypothesis that God is the author of the Vedas is sound.
tasmād āptoktatvād eva vedāḥ pramāṇam na nityatvāt //	The Vedas are a source of valid knowledge because they have been uttered by a trustworthy person but not because they are eternal.
nanu āptoktatvasya hetoḥ pakṣadharmatvaṃ katham avagamyate na pratyakṣeṇa kṣoṇīdharadharmatvam iva dhūmasya vedānām āptapraṇītatvam avagamyate śravaṇayugalabalalabdhajanmani pratyaye vedākhyaśabdarāśer eva pratibhāsāt /	If the Naiyāyikas argue that the Vedas are a source of valid knowledge because they have been uttered by a trustworthy person then how do they know that the reason belongs to the subject of inference, i.e., the minor premise is materially valid? When one infers that the hill is fiery because it is smoky he perceives smoke to be present in the hill. Similarly, we cannot perceive the character of being uttered by a trustworthy person to be present in the Vedas. As the Vedas consist only of words so they can be only perceived with our ears.
na codāttādivat varṇadharmatvena āptoktatvaṃ gṛhyate // nāpy anumānam asiminn arthe liṅgābhāvāt /	But the character of being uttered by a trustworthy person is never perceived as the property of a letter. We cannot also establish by means of an inference that the said property belongs to the Vedas since there is no mark which points to the conclusion.
prāmāṇye hi vedasya āptoktatvaṃ liṅgam /	The Vedas are held to be a source of valid knowledge because they have been uttered by a trustworthy person.
āptoktatvānumitau tu na liṅgāntaram upalabhāmaha iti kutasyaḥ pakṣadharmatvaniścayaḥ ucyate alaṃ sarasvatīkṣodena ukta eva pakṣadharmatvaniścayopāyaḥ /	But one fails to prove that the Vedas have been uttered by a trustworthy person since no reason is available. Such being the state of our knowledge how can we say that the Vedas have been uttered by a trust- worthy person. This is the sum and substance of the objections, raised by the Mimāṁsakas against the Nyaya-hypothesis.
tathā hi śabdasya sādhitaṃ tāvad anityatvaṃ svistaram / racanāḥ kartṛm atyaś ca racanātvād iti sthitam //	It has been elaborately proved that a sound is not eternal and that every arrangement of letters presupposes an author since it partakes of the nature of an arrangement of letters.
kartā sarvasya sarvajñaḥ puruṣo 'stīti sādhitam /	It has also been proved that there is an omniscient creator of all effects.
kāryeṇānuguṇaṃ kalpyaṃ nimittam iti ca sthitam //	We should assume such a cause as satisfactorily explains an effect.
pratyakṣādiviśvādaḥ vede parihariṣyate / vyāghātapaunaruktyādidoṣāś ca vacanāntare // vidhyarthavādamantrāṇāṃ upayogaś ca vakṣyate /	The defects pointed out by the critics such as mutual contradiction, tauto- logy, etc, will be answered. The efficacy of injunctions, praises, condemnations, VedicVedas as a source of valid knowledge mythology and incantations will be shown.
na mātrāmātram apy asti vede kiñcid apārthakam //	No iota of the con- tents of the Vedas is superfluous.
śabdabrahmavivartādikalpanāś ca purodetāḥ / sarvāḥ parihariṣyante kāryatvasya virodhikāḥ //	All such assumptions, viz., the Vedas are the evolute of Sabda Brahman, etc., as oppose the hypothesis that the Vedas have been composed will be refuted.

If all the contents of the Vedas are proved to be true then it may be boldly asserted that the Vedas have been composed by a trustworthy person.

The Naíyāyikas meet it with the remark that the above hypothesis is established by perception. All the syllogistic arguments, viz., "All arrangements of letters are composition" "The Vedas are arrangements of letters. Therefore the Vedas are composi- tion" and the negative criticisms which refute the hypothesis of the rival schools discharge the function of an accessory condi- tion.
vyāptiḥ punar asya hetoḥ āyurvedādivākyeṣu niścīyate /pippalīpaṭolamūlader apy auṣadhasya ittham upayogāt idam abhimatamāsādyate /	The efficacy of some medicinal herbs and roots, viz., pippali, patola, mula, etc., has been narrated in the Ayur-Veda. When they are used by a diseased person the desired result follows from them.

The truth of such statements is directly ob- served by us. We know that there is perfect accordance of these statements with facts. But these statements are true because they have been uttered by a trustworthy person.
ataḥ yatrāptavādatvaṃ tatra prāmāṇyam iti vyāptir gṛhyate //	The truth of the generalization "What is stated by a trust-worthy person is true" is directly grasped by us.

When evil clouds which hurl thunder- bolts at random hover above the cornfields, the danger of crops is averted by the recital of mantras.
atas teṣāṃ viṣabhūtāśaniśamanakuśalānāṃ āptā upadeṣṭāra iti tatrāpi tathaiva vyāpitniścayaḥ //	The trust-worthy persons are the preceptors of these persons who are expert in driving away the evil spirits, thunder-bolts, etc. Thus, the truth of the above generalization is also verified in these cases.
nanu āyurvedādau prāmāṇyaṃ pratyakṣādisaṃvādāt pratipannam nāptaprāmāṇyāt / ataḥ kathamāptoktatvasya tatra vyāptigrahaṇam naitad evam pratyakṣādisaṃvādāt tanniścīyatāṃ nāma prāmāṇyam utthitaṃ tu tat āptoktatvāt /	Now, a question arises in our mind, viz., the Ayur-Veda is true because it accords with facts which are perceived by us, How do we say that the Ayur-Veda is true because it has been uttered by a trustworthy person ? The truth of the above generalization is not convincing. The said criticism is not sound. We may perceive the accordance of the said science with facts and determine its validity thereby. But we do not explain how it acquires its validity.
pratyakṣādāv apy arthakriyājñānasaṃvādāt prāmāṇyasya jñaptiḥ /	The genesis of its validity is to be traced to the utterance of a trust-worthy person. The efficacy of this science is tested by perception.
utpattis tu guṇavatkārakakṛtyet uktam //	But if the metaphysical aspect of its truth is discussed then we hold that it has become true because it owes its existence to such a cause as has excellent property.
nadyādivākyāni ca vipralambhakapuruṣabhāṣitāni visaṃvadanti loke dṛśyante /	We have noticed that the statements of deceitful person. viz., 'there are such and such objects on the banks of a river, etc., do not accord with facts.
tenāptapraṇītatvam eva teṣāṃ prāmāṇyakāranam kāraṇaśuddhim antareṇa samyakpratyayānutpādāt /	Hence, we strongly re-assert our hypothesis that a statement is true because it has been uttered by a trust-worthy person. The source must be perfect otherwise the effect of an impure cause cannot produce true knowledge.
niścayopāyas tu pratyakṣaṃ bhavatu na tu tatkṛtam eva pramāṇyam /	Perception may help to ascertain the truth ofa statement but does not impart truth to it.
ataḥ yuktam āptoktatāyāḥ āyurvedādau vyāptigrahaṇam //	Therefore it is sound on our part to hold that what is uttered by a trust-worthy person, is true. The above genera- lization has been verified in the Ayurveda and other cases.
nanu evam api na yuktam āptokttatvasya tatra paricchettum aśakyatvāt / anvayavyatirekamūlam eva āyurvedavākyānāṃ prāmāṇyam nāptakṛtam /	The method in question is not sound since it is beyond our powers to know that the said works have been composed by a trustworthy person. By the application of the joint method ofVedas as a source of valid knowledge agreement and difference we come to know that the statements contained in the Ayur Veda are true but we do not know them to be true because they have been composed by a trust-worthy person.
anvayavyatirekau ca yāvaty eva dṛśyete tāvaty evārthe prāmāṇyam yathā harītakyādivākyārthe /	The statements which are verified by the application of the joint method of agreement and difference are only known to be true. Let us take for example the statement about marbyl- lion, etc.
yatra tu tayor adarśanaṃ tatrāpramāṇyam yathā somarājyupayoge samāḥ sahasraṃ jīvyate iti /	The statement that one who uses somarāji lives a thousand years illustrates our point.
āpte tu kalpyamāne 'rdhajaratīyaṃ syāt / arthe tasyāptatvam ardhe ca katham anāptatvam iti //	If we assume that the Ayur-Veda has been composed by a trust- worthy person then we should hold that it has been partially composed by a trust-worthy person and partially composed by an unreliable person.
tad idam anupapannam anvayavyatirekayoḥ grahītum aśakyatvāt /	Because the truth of the Ayur-Veda cannot be verified by the application of the joint method of agreement and difference.
tau hi svātmani vā grahītuṃ śakyete vyaktyantare vā vyaktyantare 'pi sarvatra kvacid eva vā vyaktiviśeṣe sarvathā saṃkaṭo 'yaṃ panthāḥ /	Does the person who frames the above proposition make an experiment on himself in order to verify the truth of the Ayur-Veda? Or, does he do it on some-body else? If he makes an experiment on a person other than himself then does it universally hold good or does it hold good on a particular person at a particular time and place ? In any case the path in question is beset with insur- mountable impediments.

The diseases are endless. The action of metals, herbs and other substances, having various properties, upon the animal bodies cannot be numerically counted. A man cannot cross the ocean in the shape of the science of medicine even if he tries to do it for lacs of yugas.
yad eva dravyam ekasya dhātor bhavati śāntaye / yogāntarāttadevāsya punaḥ kopāya kalpate //	A particular substance which cures the disease of a person,518 Nyāyamanjari having a particular constitution, is conducive to his ill-being when it is chemically combined with other substances.
yā dravyaśaktir ekatra puṃsi nāsau narāntare /	A substance having medicinal property produces an effect on a person but does nothing on another person.
harītakyāpi nodbhūtavātakuṣṭe virecyate // śaradyudriktapittasya jvarāya dadhi kalpate / tad eva bhuktaṃ varṣāsu jvaraṃ hanti daśāntare //	If a person drinks sour milk in autumn then he gets fever since the secretion of bile at that time is excessive. But if he drinks it during the rainy season then he is cured of fever since the conditions of his system are then different.
na copalakṣaṇaṃ kiñcit asti tacchaktivedane / yenaikatra gṛhītā 'sau sarvatrāvagatā bhavet //	There is not the slightest sign to know the universal healing property of a medicinal substance so that if it is known as hold- ing good in a particular case then it may not be known as holding good universally.
yo vā jñātuṃ prabhavati puruṣaḥ tatsāmarthyaṃ niravadhiviṣayam / syāt sarvajñaḥ sa iti na vimatiḥ tasmin kāryā svavacanakathite //	The person who is capable of knowing the details of every thing should be omniscient since his powers are infinite. His existence should not be controverted, raising counter-argu- ments.

They hold that the science of medicine has not been composed but is only remem- bered like the science of grammar and the like.

yathā vyākaraṇasmṛteḥ śiṣṭaprayogo mūlaṃ evam ihānvayavyatirekau /	As the science of grammar is based upon the usage of a connoisseur so the truth of the medical science hing- es upon the joint method of agreement and difference.
śiṣṭavirodhe sati yathā mūlavirodhinī pāṇinyādismṛtir apramāṇam tathā cāhuḥ iha na bhvaty anabhidhānāt iti /	The grammar of Pāṇini and others based upon the pre-existing uses, is incorrect if it finds fault with the uses of the expert.
evaṃ vaidyasmṛtir api anvayavyatirekaviruddhā na pramāṇam iti tad etad anyuktam anvayavyatirekayor yathoktanayena paricchedāsambhavena tanmūlatvānupapatteḥ //	Similarly, some critics hold that a statement of the medical science is not to be taken as true if its truth is not verified by the joint method of agreement and difference. If the conclusion of the medicalVedas as a source of valid knowledge 519 science is contradicted by the joint method of agreement and difference then it is wrong.

If you hold that Caraka has composed his medical treatise, hav- ing ascertained all the properties of all substances record- ed in it by the joint method of agreement and difference then we strongly assert that such glorification of the joint method of agreement and difference has been discredited. We have made a number of experiments only on a por- tion of the medical science till today, applying the joint method of agreement and difference.
anāditvam api śāstrāṇāṃ vedavad anupapannam carakādikrtṛsmṛteḥ kālidāsāsismṛtivad avigītatvāt /	On noticing the result of these experiments we are able to ascertain the truth of that portion of the said science since there is perfect consilience between a claim and its fulfilment.

tasmāt sarvajñapraṇīta evāyurvedaḥ //	Therefore, an omniscient person is the author of Ayur-Veda.
nanu aviduṣām upadeśo nāvakalpata iti vidvāṃsaḥ carakādayaḥ kalpyantām /	The advice of an ignorant person is of no use. So we should assume the Carala and others are well acquainted with the contents of their work.
te tu pratyakṣeṇaiva sarvaṃ viditavant ity atra kiṃ mānam ucyate anvayavyatirekayor nirāsāt nānumānasyaiva viṣayaḥ /	Is there any proof which points to the hypothesis that they have directly known all these objects? A520 reply to this question is as follows. As the joint method of agree- ment and difference has its limitations so all matters discussed by Caraka are beyond the reach of inferential knowledge.
vedamūlatvam api manvādismṛtivat ayuktaṃ kalpayitum kartṛsāmānyāsaṃbhavād iti varṇayiṣyāmaḥ /	We shall show later on that it is not reasonable to conjecture that all contents of his work have been borrowed from the Vedas like the law-book of Manu because all the so-colled basic works have not been composed by a single author.
puruṣāntaropadeśapūrvakatve carakeṇava kim aparāddham upamanamānāśaṅkanīyam evāsminn arthe /	If somebody else is held to be a pioneer in this matter then why is Caraka open to blame? We cannot think of the service of an analogical argument to solve this problem.
arthāpattis tu na pramāṇāntaram /	Presumption is not a distinct source of knowledge.

If such prescriptions do not prove their efficacy then it has been stated that the medical science is partially true. The above defect does not invalidate the medical science.
vaidkeṣu ca karmasu mīmāṃsakasya samāno guṇaḥ //	The Mimāṁsakas speak highly to the Vedic rites. The injunctions enjoining these rites are also open to the same defects.
kārīryādau kā te vartā yasyāṃ na syād iṣṭau vṛṣṭiḥ /	Suppose, you perform the Vedic rite Kārīrî but rain does not fall.
vaiguṇyaṃ cet kartrādīnāṃ atrāpy evaṃ śakyaṃ vaktum //	A similar argument can also be advanced in favour of the truth of the medical science.
yadi vidhuram abhuktaṃ karma śastrīyam anyat phalavighaṭanahetuḥ kalpyate so 'pi tulyaḥ /	A secular action which does not yield a result is defective. But a rite enjoined by the Sastras, though unfruitful, is not so.
kvacid atha phalasaṃpat dṛśyate tatprayoge tad iha dṛḍhaśarīrāh santi dīrthāyuṣaś ca //	Good results are sometimes observed on the application of some medicines. The persons who use them become very strong and long-lived.
āyurvedas tasmāt āptakṛto nānyamūla iti siddham /	Therefore, the science of medicine has beenVedas as a source of ralid knowledge composed by a trustworthy person. It has no other sources.

tasmāt āptoktatvasya siddham āyurvedādau vyāptigrahaṇam /	521 Hence the generalisation "What has been stated by a reli- able person is true" has been applied to the Ayur-Veda and found to be true.
vyāptipradarśanāyaiva sūtrakṛtā sa dvividho dṛṣṭādṛṣṭārthatvāt 1.1.8 ity uktam /	In order to vindicate the truth of the above generalisation the author of the Nyaya-Sutra states that the statement of a trustworthy person admits of two kinds because it points to perceptible and transcendental objects.
dṛṣṭārthaśabde gṛhītāvinābhāvaṃ āptoktatvaṃ adṛṣṭārthe 'pi prāmāṇyaṃ sādhayatīti /	By means of induction we arrive at the conclusion that the statement of a trustworthy person about transcendental objects is also true.
ata evoktaṃ mantrāyurvedaprāmāṇyavac ca tatprāmāṇyam āptaprāmāṇyāt 2.1.69 iti //	Therefore, the works containing the mantras, etc., owe their truth to a trustworthy person, their author.
nanv atrāpi na vaidyakaṃ viracayan dṛṣṭo muniḥ sarvavit tadvyāptigrahaṇaṃ jane yadi vṛthā ''yurvedasaṃkīrtanam /	They argue that no omniscient sage is ever found out to be the author of the medical science. If it is seen that the contents of a medical treatise are rue because its author is omniscient then the illustrations such as the Ayur-Veda, etc., have been vainly mentioned.
satyaṃ kin tu dṛḍhā tathāpi carakādyāptasmṛtir vaidyake nāsau cānyanibandhaneti kathitā tasyeha dṛṣṭāntatā // ity āyurvedavākyaprabhṛtiṣu bhavati vyāptir āptoktāyāḥ pūrvoktena krameṇa sphuṭamakathi tathā pakṣadharmatvam asyāḥ /	How is it that such medical treatises have been cited as instances which corroborate the extrinsic truth of the Vedas ? The Naiyãyikas meet the above objection, raised by the Mīmāmsaks. They say that the generalization "the statement of a trustworthy person is true" has been distinctly verified and found to be universally true when it has been applied to the statements of the Ayur-Veda, etc.

It is not also set at naught by another syllogistic argument. The middle term fulfils all the five conditions which are required522 Nyāyamanjari for drawing a true conclusion. Therefore, it correctly draws the conclusion.
kva girām ayathārthatānivṛttiḥ puruṣapratyayam antareṇa dṛṣṭā //	We are not aware of a single case which we assert as true unless we believe that the person who has made the statement is reliable.
tatpratyayāt bahutaradraviṇavyayādisādhyeṣu karmasu tapaśu ca vaidikeṣu /	As there is unshaky confidence in the truthfulness of the author of the Vedas so the Vedas have right, backed by reason, to induce persons to perform Vedic rites and difficult sacrifices which involve a heavy expenditure of money etc.
yuktaṃ pravartanamabādhanakena naiva tatsiddhir ity alam asammata eṣa mārgaḥ //	If the Vedas are simply free from contradiction, they cannot induce persons to such actions. No need of further discussions. The hypothesis, suggested by the Mimāṁsakas is not acceptable.
tasmād āptoktatvād eva devāḥ pramāṇam iti siddham //	Therefore the Vedas are the source of valid knowledge because they have been uttered by a trustworthy person.
anye tu anyathā vedaprāmāṇyaṃ varṇayanti /	The method of Ascertaining the truth of the Vedas as suggested by the Mimāṁsakas Some other philosophers prove the veracity of the Vedas in a different manner.
tasya hi prāmāṇye abhyupagataparalokaḥ anabhyupagataparaloko vā paro vipratipadyate tatrānabhupagataparalokaṃ prati tāvat ātmanityatādinyāyapūrvakaṃ paralokasamarthanam eva nidheyam //	One of them believes in the existence of the next world. The other set does not believe in the existence of such world. We should prove the immortality of the soul, etc., by means of syllogistic arguments, meet the arguments of the said non- believers and establish the existence of the next world.
paralokavādināṃ tu mate yad etat sukhiduḥkhyādibhedena jagato vaicitryaṃ dṛśyate tad avaśyaṃ karmavaicitryanibandhanam eva /	Those who believe in the existence of the next world hold that the diversities, noticed in this world, viz., some are happy, some are unhappy and so on, are exclusively due to differences in their actions in the past.
karmāṇi cānanuṣṭhitāni nātmānaṃ labhante /	Actions do not come into being if they are not performed.
alabdhātmanāṃ ca nabhaḥkusumanibhānāṃ kuto vicitrasukhaduḥkhādiphalasādhanatvam tasmāt anuṣṭhānam eṣām eṣitavyam /	If they do not come into being, they are as unreal as the sky-flowers are. How will they bring obout results, viz., happiness, misery, etc.? Therefore one cannot but subs- cribe to the hypothesis that good or bad actions have been performed.
anuṣṭhānaṃ ca nāviditasavrūpāṇāṃ karmaṇām upapannam /	If one does not know the nature of an action, he cannot perform it.
ajānan puruṣaḥ tapasvī kim anutiṣṭhat tad avaśyaṃ jñātvā 'nuṣṭheyāni karmāṇi // tad idānīṃ teṣāṃ parijñāne ko 'bhypāyaḥ na pratyakṣaṃ asmadānīnāṃ svargādyadṛṣṭapuruṣārthasādhanāni karmāṇi darśayituṃ prabhavati //	Which act will a poor fellow undertake as he knows nothing about it? As actions can be done only when their nature is completely known. What is the source of its know-Mināṁsakas' argument for establishing the truth of the Veda 523 ledge? Sense-perception is not capable of throwing light on such actions as lead to transcendental ends such as Heaven etc. An action is not also an inference.
nāpy anumānam anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ tṛptibhojanayor iva svargayāgayoḥ sādhyasādhanasambandhānavadhāraṇāt //	By the joint method of agreement and difference the causal relation subsisting between the act of eating and the feeling of satisfaction is established. But by the same method we fail to establish the causal relation holding between a sacrifice and heavenly bliss.
nāpy arthāpattiḥ jagadvaicitryānyathā 'nupapattyā tu vicitraṃ kāraṇamātram anumīyate / na ca tāvatā 'nuṣṭhānasiddhiḥ /	As we cannot otherwise explain the diversities of this world so we infer the existence of different conditions in order to explain them. The knowledge of the diverse conditions being vague one cannot be guided by this light to perform an act.
uktaṃ ca adharme dharmarūpe vā 'py avibhakte phalaṃ prati /	It has been stated to this effect. We should definitely know that virtue or vice brings about the particular result.
kim apy astīti vijñānaṃ narāṇāṃ kvopayujyate iti // upamānaṃ tv atra śaṅkyamānam api na śobhate //	If our knowledge is indefinite, does it help us in any way? The services of an analogical argument may be thought of in this context. But it is of no use.
nāpi parasparam upadiśanto laukikāḥ karāṇi paralokaphalāni jātīyur iti vaktuṃ yuktaṃ ajñātvā upapādayatāṃ āptatvāyogāt /	Though the common people advise one another regarding actions to be performed yet it is un-reasonable to hold that they should know actions which lead the performer up to heaven.
jñātuṃ tu laukikānāṃ durghaṭam pramāṇābhāvād ity uktatvāt /	The persons who are ignorant of the scriptures cannot properly know actions because there is no sufficient reason in support of their knowledge.
eva eva hi puruṣopadeśaparaṃparākalpanāyāṃ andhaparaṃparānyāyaḥ syāt /	If we suppose that the knowledge of actions is handed down by the preceding generation to the succeeding one then it will only amount to this that a batch of blind men is led by another batch of such men.
tasmād avaśyaṃ abhyupagataparalokaiḥ paralokaphalāni karmāṇi kurvadbhiḥ śāstrāt karmāvabodho 'bhyupagantavyaḥ /	There- fore when the believers in the existence of the next world will perform actions which are fruitful in the next world they should at first learn from the scriptures the efficacy of each action.
śāstraṃ ca vedā eveti siddhaṃ tatprāmāṇyam //	The scriptures in question are the Vedas.
nanu lokapratisiddhita eva dharmādharmasādhanāni karmāṇi jñāsyante kiṃ śāstreṇa upakārāpakārau hi dharmādharmayor lakṣaṇam iti prasiddham evaitat /	A person will be initiated into the mystery of action conducive to either virtue or to vice by means of popular ideas. No know- ledge of the Sastras is required. The popular definition of virtue or of vice is this: what does good to us is virtue and what does disservice to us is vice.
tathā ''ha vyāsahaḥ idaṃ puṇyam idaṃ pāpaṃ ity etasmin padadvaye /	In other words, what is good is virtue and what is evil is vice. Vyása has also said to this524 effect.
ācaṇḍālaṃ manuṣyāṇāṃ alpaṃ śāstraprayojanam //	Nobody including even the untouchable Candalas depends much upon the Sastras in order to know virtue or vice.
iti naitad yuktam lokaprasiddher nirmūlāyāḥ pramāṇatvānupapatteḥ /	The above view does not hold good since the popular view which is not based upon a sound basis is not true.
lokaprasiddhir nāma laukikānām avicchinnā smṛtiś ca prabhavantī pramāṇāntaramūlā bhavati na svatantretyavaśyam asyā mūlam anveṣaṇīyam /	The popular view is nothing but an uninterrupted series of remembrances of the view in question. Memory owes its origin to some form of true knowledge but does never arise independently.
tac ca pratyakṣādi nopapadyate iti nūnaṃ śāstramūlaiva lokaprasiddhiḥ /	Therefore the popular view must be based upon the Sastric doctrine.
viruddhān ekaprakārātvāc ca lokaprasiddheḥ na tasyāṃ svatantrāyāṃ samāśvasiti lokaḥ // na copakārāpakārakamātralakṣaṇāveva dharmādharmau vaktuṃ yujyete japaśīdhupānādau tadabhāvāt /	As the popular views of a particular subject are many and incompati- ble with one another so people do not place their confidence in a popular view if it has an independent origin. It is not logical to define that virtue is good and vice is evil since the above definition does not apply to the muttering of incanta- tions and to the drinking of wine. (The muttering of incanta- tions does no palpable good to us. The drinking of wine in moderate doses does no palpable injury to us).
gurudāragamanādau ca viparyayādityavaśyaṃ śāstraśaraṇāv eva tatreṣitavyau //	Again, one may derive pleasure from the sinful act, viz., the illicit connection with the wife of a preceptor, etc.

Such and such sacrifices produce these results. The recitation of such and such mantras yields such and such results. This person is entitled to this act. These are the subsidiary rites which are to be performed in order to render the principal rite complete. This is the proper place where a rite is to be perfor- med.
śāstraṃ ca veda evety uktam /	The Sastras in question are nothing but the Vedas.
atas tasya nirvivādasiddham eva prāmāṇyam iti // evaṃ tu varṇyamāne saṃsārānāditvaṃ tāvad uktaṃ syāt /	Therefore, the validity of the Vedas stands above all disputes. This is what we have got to say. If the above thesis is presented in this manner, the view that the world has no beginning is forced on us.
vedasyānāditvaṃ karmajñānānāditvāt /	As our know- ledge of the Vedic rites does not commence from a particular date so the Vedas should also be accepted as eternal.
tataś ca mīmāṃsakavartmanaiva pramṇatā sidhyati nāptavādāt /	In that case, we cannot hold that they are true because they have been composed by a trustworthy person.
tasmādyathodāhṛta eva mārgaḥ pramānatāyām anuvartanīyaḥ //	Therefore the path adopted by us in order to prove the validity of the Vedas, is the sure way to the establishment of their validity.
atha vā vayam api na na śiṣmo 'nādisaṃsārapakṣaṃ yugapadakhilasargadhvaṃsavāde tu medaḥ /	525 We do not subscribe to the hypothesis that the world has no beginning. There is divergence of opinions regarding the hypo- thesis according to which there will be simultaneous destruction of the whole universe.
akathi ca racanānāṃ kāryata tena sargātprabhṛti bhagavatedaṃ vedaśāstraṃ praṇītam //	All compositions partake of the character of an effect. Therefore, God has composed the Vedas in the beginning of this world.
anādir eveśvarakartṛko 'pi sadaiva sargapralayaprabandhaḥ /	But the creation and the destruction of the world go on in a cyclic order for ever.
sargāntareṣv eva ca karmabodhaḥ vedāntarebhyo 'pi janasya sidhyet //	Men may be enlightened on the rituals from the different Vedas in the different cycles of creation.
anyatve kiṃ pramāṇaṃ nanu tava sumate kiṃ tadaikye pramāṇaṃ dhvastaṃ tāvat samastaṃ bhuvanam iti tadā vedanāśo 'py avaśyam /	Now, the Mimamsakas may put a question to the Naiyāyikas viz., "Is there any proof which establishes the hypothesis that the Vedas are different in the different cycles of creation"? The Naiyāyikas give an answer in this effect: "Oh intelligent thinkers; is there any proof regarding the oneness of the Vedas in every cycle of creation ?" When the whole world is destroyed at the end of creation the Vedas necessarily meet their destruc- tion.
ekastvīśo 'viśiṣṭaḥ sa ca racayati vā prāktanaṃ saṃsmared vā vede svātantryam asmin niyata m ubhayathā 'py asti candrārdhamauleḥ //	He may either compose the new Vedas or may recollect the old ones. We may subscribe to any one of these two hypotheses. But it is a truism that God who has half- moon on his forehead enjoys absolute independence in this matter.
ekasya tasya manasi pratibhāsamānaḥ vedas tadā hi kṛtakān na viśiṣyate 'sau /	The Vedas with the dawn of creation are presented to the consciousness of God who is without a second. They cannot be different from those that were composed.
pratyakṣasarvaviṣayasya tu neśvarasya yuktā smṛtiḥ karaṇam eva tato 'navadyam //	God has no memory as He always intuits all objects. The hypothesis that the Vedas have been composed is immune from all defects.
tenāptanirmitatayaiva niratyayārthasaṃpratyayopajananāya janasya vede / śāstraṃ suvistaraprapāstakutarkamūlamohaprapañcamakarot munirakṣapādaḥ //	In fine, the sage Akṣapāda has written an elaborate treatise on logic in order to convince the people that the Vedas impart true knowledge because the Vedas have been composed by a trust-worthy person.
atra kaścid āha yuktam itaretaravyatiṣakārthopadeśitvenaikakartṛkatvānumānadvārakaṃ trivedyāḥ prāmāṇyam /	Hence we infer that these three Vedas have been composed by the same author. They are the source of valid knowledge as it is an inference that they owe their existence to one and the same author.
atharvavedasya tu trayyāmnātadharmopayogānupalabdheḥ triyībāhyatvena na tatsamānayogakṣematvam // anapekṣatvalakṣaṇaprāmāṇyapakṣe 'pi vikṣiptaśāstrāntaropadiṣṭaviśiṣṭajyotiṣṭomādyanekakarmānupraviṣṭahautrādhvaryāvādivyāpāravyatiṣaṅgadarśanāt tadarthā trayyeva yathā prāṇabhāvabhāginī bhavitum arhati na tathā pṛthagvyavahārā ātharvaṇaśrutiḥ //	But the Atharva Veda is entirely different from the above three Vedas since it has no concern with the religious rites mentioned in them. For this very reason it cannot be a source book of the religious rites. Even if we accept the hypothesis that the Vedas are the highest authority and their validity is intrinsic then we arrive at the conclusion that the Atharva Veda does not enjoy the same validity along with the other three Vedas since it enjoins some actions which are not included in the three Vedas. The Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda enjoin the biggest religious acts such as the Soma-sacrifices Jyotiştoma etc.
tathā ca loke catasra imā vidyāḥ prāṇināmanugrahāya pravṛttāḥ ānvīkṣakī trayī vārtā daṇḍanītir iti prasiddhiḥ /	The science which renders a distinct service to the people admits of four-fold division, viz., the science of logic, the three Vedas, the body of Vocational training and Political or Economic science.
śrutismṛtī api tadanuguṇārthe eva dṛśyete /	Śruti and Smrti bear evidence to the above view.
śrutis tāvat ṛgbhiḥ prātardiṣi deva īyate /	The relevant portion in the passages is that they refer only to the three Vedas.
yajurvedena tiṣṭhati madhye 'hnaḥ / sāmāvedenāstam eti / vedair aśūnyastribhir eti sūryaḥ iti / tathā prajāpatirakāmayata bahusyāṃ prajāyeyeti / sa tapo 'taṇyata /	Manu has also stated in his section on funeral ceremony that one who performs funeral ceremony should earnestly feed Brahmaņas who have made a complete study of the Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda together with the corresponding Brāhmaṇas and the different recensions of the Vedas.
imān lokānasmṛjata pṛthivīmantarikṣaṃ divam iti / tān lokānabhyatapat tebhyas trīṇi jyortīṣyajāyanta /	Manu makes mention only of those Brahmaṇas who have made a complete study of the three Vedas as entitled to the funeral feast.
agnir eva pṛthivyā ajāyata vāyur antarikṣāt diva āditya iti /	But he does not make mention of the Brāhmaṇas who have studied the Atharva Veda.
tāni jyortīṣyabhyatapat /	Nay, in some cases, prohibition is noticed.
tebhyas trayo vedā ajāyanta / agner ṛgvedaḥ /	A Brahmin who is well-versed in the Atharva Veda should not be invited to do this and that act.
vādayor yajurvedaḥ / ādityātsāmavedaḥ /	Let us suppose that the Atharva Veda has no efficacy in the Vedic sacrifices.
tathā saiṣā vidyā trayī tapati iti // smṛtir api mānavī prativedaṃ dvādaśavārṣikabrahmacaryopadeśinī dṛśyate ṣaṭtriṃśadvārṣikaṃ caryaṃ gurau traivedikaṃ vratam iti //	In order to observe these rites the assistance of a priest is required as the services of Hotr Adhvaryu and Udgätṛ are requisitioned in connection with the performance of sacrifices prescribed in the three Vedas. The priest, proficient in the Atharva Veda, is called 'Brahman'.
śrāddhaprakaraṇe 'pi yatnena bhojayecchrāddhe bahvṛcaṃ vedapāragam /	This Veda is the only authority on the above rites.
iti trivedapāragāneva śrāddhabhujaḥ brāhmaṇān darśayati nātharṣavedādhyāyinaḥ / pratyuta niṣedhaḥ kvacid upadiśayate tasmād ātharvaṇaṃ na pravṛñjayātiti //	The objections raised against the authority of the Atharva Veda are not sound. The sage Bădarāyaṇa holds that the Vedas are the independent sources of valid knowledge because they do not presuppose the other sources of knowledge for their validity.
arthāntare pramāṇatvaṃ kenāsyāḥ pratihanyate śāntipuṣṭyabhicārārthāḥ ekabrahmartvigāśritāḥ / kriyās tayā pramīyante trayī vātmīyagocaraḥ iti //	Jaimini has shown the way to ascertain the validity of the Vedas, following the foot-steps of Bädarāyaṇa.
tathā hi tatpramāṇaṃ bādarāyaṇasyānapekṣatvāt iti ya eṣa vedaprāmāṇyādhigatau jaimininā niradeśi panthāḥ yo vā akṣapādena kaṇādena ca prakaṭitaḥ tadvacanādāmnāyaprāmāṇyam iti mantrāyurvedapramāṇyavañ ca tatprāmāṇyam āptaprāmāṇyāt iti sa caturṣv api vedeṣu tulyaḥ /	Akşapâda and Kanada have established the validity of the Vedas by means of a different method. The Vedas are true because they are God's words. Aksapâda holds that the Vedas are true like Mantra and Ayur Veda because they have been composed by a trustworthy person. If we follow any one of the above methods then we see that each of them equally leads to the validity of the four Vedas.
tatra viśeṣatuṣo 'pi na kaścid atiprayatnenānviṣiṣyamāṇaḥ prāpyate /	Even if we make a thorough search, we find the least difference in the Vedas.
nāpi naiyāyikapakṣe evaṃ vaktuṃ śakyam āptapraṇītāḥ trayo vedāḥ caturthas tu nāptapraṇīta iti / tena prāmāṇyāṣigamopāyāṣiśeṣāt samānayogakṣematayā catvāro 'pi vedāḥ pramāṇam // vyavahāro hi sarveṣāṃ sāretaravicāracaturacetasāṃ caturbhir api vedaiḥ caturṇāṃ varṇānām āśramāṇāṃ catasṛṣu dikṣu catugbdhimekhalayāmavanau prasiddha iti ko 'yam atrānyathātvabhramaḥ śrutismṛtimūlaścāryavartanivāsināṃ bhavati vyavahāraḥ /	Can any body say embracing the standpoint of the Mimāṁsakas that the three Vedas are eternal but the Atharva Veda is not so because the author of this Veda is remembered? Can any body hold from528 the standpoint of the Naiyāyikas that the three Vadas have been composed by a trustworthy person but the Atharva Veda has not been so composed? Hence as the method of determin- ing the validity of the Vedas is the same so the four Vedas are equally true, being treated by the same logic. It is well known that all manners and customs of discriminating persons belonging to the four castes and the four different stages of life on this Earth, encircled by the four seas, are based upon the four Vedas. Therefore, no body should suspect the validity of the Atharva Veda.
te ca śrutismṛtī caturo 'pi vedān samānakaṣyānabhivadataḥ /	The Vedas and Smṛti declare that the four Vedas stand on the same level of authority.
ṛgyajuśāmavedeṣv api atharvavedāṃśasīni bhūyāṃsi vacāṃsi bhavanti /	Many sentences of the Atharva Veda find a place in the Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Säma Veda.
tadyathā śatapathe atha tṛtīye 'han ity upakramya aśvamedhe pāriplavākhyāne so 'yam ātharvaṇo vedaḥ iti śrūyate /	When it enlightens the rites to be observed on the third day of horse-sacrifice it refers to the mythological stories to be narrated in connection with the per- formance of the Pariplava sacrifice. In this context a sentence that it is that Atharva Veda is found.
chāndogyopaniṣadi ca ṛgvedo yajurvedaḥ sāmaveda ātharvaṇaś caturthaḥ iti paṭhyate //	The Chandogya Upani- şad makes mention of the Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda and also of the Atharva Veda as the fourth one.
nanu itihāsapurāṇaḥ pañcamaḥ iti tatra paṭhyata eva //	Now a question arises in our mind. In the Chandogya Upanişad, History as well as the Puranas have also been mentioned as the fifth branch of study.
kiñ cātaḥ kim iyatā 'tharvaś caturtho na bhavati vedaḥ caturthaśabdopādānāt itihāsāditulyo 'sau na vedasamānakakṣya iti cet keyaṃ kalpanā caturthaśabdopādānādapradhānye trayo vedā asṛjyanta ityādau tritvasaṃkhyopādānāt te 'pi na pradhānatām adhigaccheyuḥ / itihāsādibhir vā saha parigaṇanaṃ aprādhānyakāranaṃ yad ucyate tad api sarvavedasādhāraṇam iti yat kiñcid etat //	What is your exact question? Do you suggest that story as well as the Purăņa should be the fifth Veda? Or do you suggest that the Atharva Veda should not be the fourth Veda? As the Atharva Veda is qualified by the adjectice "fourth" so it comes down to the level of history and the Purāṇa but does not go up to the level of the Vedas. Why does this suggestion appear in your mind? If you think that the adjective "fourth" assigns a subordinate position to the Atharva Veda then as in another place it has been said that the three Vedas were created so the adjective 'three' being applied to the Vedas, the three Vedas should also be thrown into the shade.If you argue like this that the counting of the Atharva Veda along with History and the Purăņa is atValidity of the Atharva Veda 529 the root of its subordinate position then we point out that such an argument is baseless since all the Vedas have been counted along with them.
tathā śatādhyayane 'pi ṛco vai brahmaṇaḥ prāṇāḥ ity abhyupakamya ātharvaṇo vai brahmaṇaḥ samānaḥ iti paṭhyate //	The Satapatha Brahmaṇa commences a topic with the remark that the Rg Veda is the vital breath of Brahman and completes it with the statement that a Brălimana well up in the Atharva Veda is equal to Brahman.
tathā ye 'sya prāñco raśmayaḥ tā evāsya prācyo madhunāḍyaḥ ṛca eva puṣpam ity upakramya paṭhita atha ye 'syodañco raśmayaḥ tā evāsyodīcyaḥ madhunāḍyaḥ atharvāṅirasa eva madhukṛtaḥ iti //	It has been stated in the Chandogya Upanişad that the rays of the sun, collected on the north, are his veins through which honey flows. The mantras seen by the sages, Atharva and Angiras are bees that produce honey. The Taittiriya Upanişad says that besides the sheath known as Prâņamaya there is another inner sheath called Manomaya.
tathā taittarīye tasmād vā etasmāt prāṇamayāt /	It makes a number of statements of this sheath.
anyo 'ntara ātmā manomayaḥ iti prastutya tasya yajur eva śiraḥ / ṛgdakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ / sāmottaraḥ pakṣaḥ /	In this connection it remarks that the Yajur Veda constitutes its head, the Rg Veda its right wing, the Sama Veda its left wing, the Brahman its soul and the Atharva Veda its tail.
ādeśa ātmā / atharvāṅgirasaḥ pucchaṃ pratiṣṭhā iti paṭhyate // tathā 'nyatra ṛcāṃ prācī mahatī dig ucyate / dakṣiṇāmāhur yajuṣām /	The Taittiriya says "To face the east is better for the recitation of the Rg Veda, to face the south is better for the recitation of the Yajur Veda, to face the south is better for the recitation of the Sama Veda and to face the west is better for the recitation of the Atharva Veda.
sāmnāmuttarām /	In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa the following statements about the holy study of the Vedas are found.
atharvaṇām aṅgirasāṃ pratīcī mahatī dig ucyate iti //	It commences with the statement that the mantras of the Rg Veda are the five mid-day oblations of milk unto gods.
śatapathe brahmayajñavidhiprakrame madhyame paya āhutayo ha vā etā vedānāṃ yadṛcaḥ ity upakramya meda āhutayo ha vā etā devānāṃ yadatharvāṅgirasaḥ sa ya evaṃ vidvānatharvāṅgiraso 'harahaḥ svādhyāyamadhīte meda āhutibhir eva taddevān sa tarpayati ta enaṃ tṛptāstarpayanti iti //	In this context it has been stated that the mantras of the Atharva Veda are the oblations of omentum to be offered to gods. He who studies the Veda everyday with this knowledge pleases gods with the offer of the oblation of omentum. Gods, being satísfied, íncur his pleasure. The mantras of the Taittiriya Samhită throw some ht on the meaning of the above statement.
mantrā api tadarthaprakāśanaparā anuśrūyante tvam agne puṣkarādadhyatharvā niramanthata ity ādayaḥ /	O Fire! a person proficient in the Atharva Veda, has kindled you from Puşkara. In the above mantras we find the word 'Atharva'.
na caiṣāṃ atharvā nāma kiñcidṛṣirityevaṃ prakāraṃ vyākhyānaṃ yuktam anyatrāpyasamāśvāsaprasaṅgāt /	It is not the name of a particular sage. Such an interpretation does not stand to reasons since similar words, found in the other Vedas, may shake our confidence in the truth of the Vedas.
ity evañjātīyakāstāvadudāhṛtāḥ śrutivācaḥ //	We have cited passages from the Samhitas, Brāhmaṇas, Upanișşads etc.
sṛtivākyāni khalv api /	in order to prove the authenticity of the Atharva Veda.

Manu uses the term 'Śruti'. He gives it a status equal to that of the three Vedas.

He says that Purāņa, Logic, Mīmāṁsā, Smṛti and six branches of the Vedas and the Vedas are the fourteen sources of knowledge and laws. Using the term 'Vedaḥ' he says that the Vedas are four but not three, otherwise the number fourteen' cannot be filled up.

It has also been stated in another law book that there are fourteen sources of knowledge, viz., Purāņa, Dharma Šāstra, Mīmāṁsā, Logic, the four Vedas and the six auxiliary sciences.

In the topic on the different recensions of Vedas as he has made references to the various recensions of the Vedas other than the Atharva Veda so he has also mentioned the two recensions of the Atharva Veda, viz,, Maṇḍuka and Paippalăda and discussed many points regarding them.

Those who are well-versed in the Vedas, Smrti, the tradition of the good people and usages have no chance of entertaining a doubt about the truth of the said conclusion.
āha na brūmaḥ atharvavedo na pramāṇam iti kintu trayībāhya iti ucyate trayapīyaṃ atharvavedabāhyaiva /	Now, the objector may contend that he does not say that the Atharva Veda is not true. But he holds that it is distinctively other than the three Vedas.

The Yajur Veda is distinct from the Rg Veda and the Sama Veda. The Rg. Veda is distinct from the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda. The Sama Veda is also distinct from the Rg Veda and the Yajur Veda.

It means that the Atharva532 Veda does not give any advice with regard to an act which is somehow connected with the three Vedas. This is what is meant by the phrase "The Atharva Veda is other than the three Vedas." Such an interpretation is not tenable.

This is a wrong statement of facts since the Atharva Veda supplies with the duties of a Brahman priest.

Raising this point he suggests that a Brāhmaṇa proficient in the Rg Veda is to be invited as a Hotr priest since he is conversant with the duties of a Hotr priest; a Brāhmaṇa well-up in the Yajur Veda is to be invited as an Adhvaryu priest because he is acquainted with the duties of an Adhvaryu priest; a Brāhmaṇa skilled in the Säma Veda, is to be invited as an Udgâtṛ priest because he is thorough- ly aware of the duties of an Udgātṛ priest and a Brāhmaṇa who is a sound scholar of the Atharva Veda is to be invited as a Brahman priest. Making the above suggestions he has said again "If you do not appoint such persons as Hotr, Adhvaryu, Udgåtr and Brahman then the sacrifice will be spoiled." There- fore one should appoint a scholar of the Rg Veda as a Hotr priest, a scholar of the Yajur Veda as an Adhvaryu priest, a scholar of the Sama Veda as an Udgātṛ priest and a scholarValidity of the Atharva Veda of the Atharva Veda as a Brahman priest.

The students of the three Vedas read the following Vedic passages.

But which Veda does help us to render the service of a Brāhmaṇa priest? They say in reply that the duties of a Brahmaņa priest may be fulfilled by the knowledge of the three Vedas.
katham yato na trayī nāma kim api vastvantaram api tu trayāṇāṃ vedānāṃ samāhāra iti /	The duties of a Brāhmaṇa priest are performed by the essence of three Vedas. In other words, there is no need of inviting a scholar of the Atharva Veda to discharge the duties of a Brahman priest.
samāhāraś ca samāhriyamāṇaniṣṭo bhavati /	A answer to the above objection is as follows.
samāhriyamāṇāś ca ṛgvedādayaḥ trayaḥ hautrādiparatvena caritārthāḥ na punas tatra bhedam arhanti /	There is no such distinct book as goes by the name "trayî" (triplet). Though the collection of the Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda is loosely called trayi Collection yet it has space enough to include other mantras.
ekaikaśaḥ caritārthānāṃ samudāyo 'pi caritārtha eva /	Each of them has become fruitful by helping to discharge the duties of a Hotr priest, etc.

kiṃ tu khalu ṛgvedādīnāṃ brahmatvaṃ kurvatāmatibhāro bhavati na brūmaḥ atibhāra iti /	If the three Vedas have to discharge the duties of a Brahman priest in addition to their own duties then will they be able to bear such a heavy burden ? We say "No, it is not a heavy burden.

Our answer is in the affirmative. But we intend to clarify our answer in the light of the principles laid down by the Vedic jurists, i.e. the Mimáṁsakas. There is a Vedic passage which states that sacrifices and animal sacrifices other than Jyoti ştoma and Darsa-cum-Pūrņamāsa should be performed for the realization of a single end but Jyotiştoma and Darśa-cum-Pūrņa māsa sacrifices should be performed for the fulfilment of all ends. But if one performs Jyotiştoma or Darśa-cum-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifice only once then all his ends are not simultaneously rea- lized.
nanu anye 'pi trayātmakā vedāḥ yad evaṃ sutarāmatharvavedo na pṛthak karaṇīyaḥ sarveṣāṃ rūpāviśeṣāt /	If the above statements are true then the Atharva Veda should not be distinguished from the three Vedas since all the Vedas have the same character.
teṣāṃ pṛthak pratiṣṭhaīḥ savaiḥ svaiḥ ṛgādibhir eva vyapadeśa iti na te samudāyaśabdavyapadeśyāḥ //	Each of the three individual Vedas which constitutes the triplet has its distinct designation. None of them bears the name of the correction of the three Vedas.
yat tu vākyāntare trayyai vidyāyai śukraṃ tena brahmatvam iti tatreyaṃ caturthī ṣaṣṭhyāḥ sthāne prayuktā /	There is a Vedic sentence "Tray- yai vidyāyai śukram tena Brahmatvam". It requires clarifica- tion. The fourth case-ending has been attached to form Trayyai and Vidyayai.
śukram iti sāramācakṣate /	The term "śukra" signifies essence (sâra).
tena trayīvidyāyāḥ sāreṇa brahmatvaṃ kriyata ity uktaṃ bhavati /	Thus the above sen- tence means that the duties of a Brahman priest are discharged by the essence of the three Vedas, viz., the Rg Veda the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda.
na ca trayyeva trayyāḥ śukraṃ bhavati / na cātyantaṃ tato 'tharvāntaram eva /	The three Vedas cannot be the essence of themselves. Again, the essence of the three Vedas cannot be absolutely different from the three Vedas.
tenedam atharvavedātmakam eva trayyāḥ śukram iti manyāmahe /	Hence the essence of the three Vedas is the Atharva Veda. Thus the Atharva Veda is an embodiment of secret doctrines.
tryātmakatvād iti manyāmahe / tryātmakatvād iti śukram iti ca guhyam āhuḥ /	The term 'Atharva,' signifies 'a mystic'. It has been stated in a particular recension of the Atharva Veda that the Atharva a Brahmaan priest discharged his duties by means of the Atharva Veda which is an essence of the three Vedas.
atharvaśabdo 'pi rahasyavacanaḥ /	For this reason the Atharva Veda is not distinct from the three Vedas.
yajñātharvāṇaṃ vaidikasyā iṣṭayaḥ iti /	All the Vedas extend their hands to perform a Vedic rite prescribed by any of the Vedas.
itthaṃ sarvaśākhapratyayam ekaṃ karma ity atra na sarvasabdaḥ saṅkocito bhavati //	'All' has not been used in a restricted sense. All the Vedas signify the four Vedas but not the three Vedas.
ata eva brahmavedaḥ atharvaveda iti pūrvottarabrāhmaḥe paṭhyate ṛgvedo yajurvedaḥ sāmavedo brahmavedaḥ iti /	So the Atharva Veda has been mentioned as the Brahman Veda in the earlier and the later parts of the Brahmana. The actual text mentions the four Vedas, viz., the Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sama Veda and the Brahma Veda.

In a sacrifice a Brahmin versed in the Atharva Veda should be appointed as a Brahman priest. Otherwise the said sacrifice remains imperfect. A Brahman priest should be properly honoured. A Brahmin, proficient in the Atharva Veda, is equal to Brahman, the Sabda- Brahman.
tathā sāmavede pṛṣṭasya caturve 'hanyārbhave pavamāne atharvaṇe sāmno gānaṃ yat tadvidhāne śrūyate caturvidham ātharvaṇaṃ bhavati catūrātrasya vṛttyai catuṣpadāmānuṣṭubhā 'nuṣṭubhamevaitadaddaryaścaturthaṃ meṣajaṃ vā 'tharvaṇaṃ taddhi bhaiṣajyam eva tatkaroty ātharvaṇāni yāgabheṣajāni ity etad ālambaneyaṃ stutiḥ /	The acts prescribed by the Atharva Veda are the articles by which he is honoured. The four Vedas participate in the Vedic rite. The food which is prepared by the Brahman priest is known as Brahmaudana. This name has been given by the Vedas themselves. When a Vedic rite is celebrated the priests known as Hotṛ, Adhvaryu, Udgățr and Brahman should be entertained with a hearty feast.
ata eva prāguktaṃ yajñe yadūnaṃ ca viriṣṭaṃ ca yātayāmaṃ ca karoti tadatharvaṇāṃ tejasā '' pyāyayati iti /	It has been stated before that the acts, prescribed by the Atharva Veda, make up deficiency, remove evils and mend all defects in a sacrifice by their influence.
tasmād ātharvaṇa eva brahmeti /	For this reason we hold that a Brahmin, well-versed in the Atharva Veda, is Brahman.
etac ca śāstrāntare vistareṇābhiyuktaiḥ yuktibhir upapāditam iti nehātyantāya pratāyate //	The sound scholars have elaborately dis- cussed this matter and logically established this conclusion in other works. Therefore, the point in question has not been very elaborately discussed in this book.

If the above statement would have been a Vedic sentence then it had been interpreted in the light of the proper context. Most probably it has bearing only upon a particular Vedic rite.
anārabhyavādapakṣe 'pi pūrvoktavākyavisadṛśārthatvāt atharvavedasya ca trayyabāhyatvena śparkaparihārānarhatvāt niyataviṣayam eva vyākyāsyate //	These two contradictory statements must be reconciled. We have cited Vedic sentences which accept the Atharva Veda as one of the Vedas. The prohibitive sentence suggests that the Atharva Veda falls outside the scope of the Vedas.
yad apy ucyate uccair ṛcā kriyate uccas sāmnāmnopāṃśu yajuṣā itivat atharvadharmo 'pi na kaścid āmnāta iti tad apy asāram maṃtradharmo hy ayam upadiśyate na vedadharmaḥ /	It has been said that the mantras of the Rg Veda are loudly recited, the mantras of the Sāma Veda are loudly chanted and the mantras of the Yajur Veda are very lowly recited but nothing has been stated about the Atharva Veda. This objection is not sound.
mantrabrāhmaṇasamudāyasvabhāvā hi catvāra ime vedapranthāḥ /	The characteris- tic features of mantras have been shown but those of the Vedas have not been pointed out.
mantrās tu vastuto gadyapadyabhedāt dvividhā eva /	The mantra part of the Vedas has two sub-divisions víz., prose and poetry.
gadyabandho yajur ucyate padmavandhaḥ ṛg iti /	The mantras of the Yajur Veda are prose. Those of the Rg Veda are metri- cal.
gītinibandhanaṃ tu bhedāntaraṃ sāmeti /	But those of the Sama Veda are not only metrical but also melodious.

Jaimini, having classified these mantras, defines them. The definitions given by him run thus. The mantras in which feet are arranged only in accordance with the sense are called Rg mantras.
teṣām eva cāyam uccastvādidharmaḥ na vedaśabdavacyānāṃ mantrabrāhmaṇasamudāyātmanāṃ granthanām /	These characteristic features such as loudness etc. do not be- long to the entire Vedas admitting of two broad divisions viz., mantras and Brahmaņas.
atharvavede 'pīyaṃ trividhaiva mantrajātir iti tatrāpīdaṃ dharmajātam upadiṣṭaṃ bhavati //	The three types of mantras already mentioned are found in the Atharva Veda.
mantravibhāgakṛta eva 'yaṃ trayīvyapadeśa iti /	The term 'trayi' owes its origin to the threefold division of the mantras, Two statements viz.
ataś ca saiṣā trayī vidyā tapati ity ādyapi na virotsyate /	(¹) **The Atharva Veda is the Trayi" and (2) "It is superior to other branches of knowledge" will not be contradictory.
evaṃ ṛgyajuśāmasamudāyātmakamantropavandhāt trayyantargataścātharvavedaḥ /	The Atharva Veda is included in the Trayi because it contains the mantras of the Rg. Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda.
pṛthagvyavasthitagranthasandarbhasvabhāvatvāc ca bhinnaḥ sa iti siddham //	But it has at the same time a distinct individuality because it repre- sents its subject-matter in its own peculiar manner.
anye punaḥ ṛkpracuratvāt praviralayajurvākyatvāt agīyamānasāmamantratāvaśāc ca ṛgvedam evātharvavedam ācakṣate /	Some other thinkers suggest that the Atharva Veda is the Rg Veda because the mantras of the Rg Veda abound in it, a small quantity of the Yajur mantras is found in it and no musical mantra of538 Nyāyamanjari the Sāma Veda is noticed in it.
ayam pai pakṣo 'stu na kaścid virodhaḥ //	We may accept this suggestion as it involves no contradiction.
yat punar abhidhīyate vedaśabdaḥ trayāṇām eva vācakaḥ na caturthasyeti so 'yam atyutkaṣto dveṣaḥ /	Those who hold that the term 'Veda' applies to the three Vedas but not to the fourth Veda cherish a strong hatred against the Atharva Veda.
vṛddhavyavahāro hy atra pramāṇam /	The usage of the experienced teachers stands as a proof in this matter.
vedo 'yam brāhmaṇo 'yam iti tatra tatra vedaśabde uccārite catvāro 'pi pratīyante /	This is the Veda. This is the Brāhmaṇa. When these sentences are uttered the listener makes out the meaning of the term 'Veda' as representing the four Vedas.
vedo mayā 'dhītaḥ iti vadantaṃ pṛcchanti vyavahartāraḥ katam astvayā 'dhīto vedaḥ iti / sa āha atharvavedaḥ iti /	When a student says before some learned scholars that he has studied the Veda they ask him "Which Veda has been studied by you?" He replies that he has studied the Atharva Veda.
na tam evam ākṣipanti nāsau vedaḥ yastvayā paṭhitaḥ iti /	Nobody condemns him with the remark "The book which has been studied by you is not the Veda".

The same remark equally applies to the other Vedas as we say that this is the Rg Veda or the Yajur- Veda or the Sama-Veda. The term 'Veda', pure and simple, also applies to the three Vedas. The same term is also equally applicable to the Atharva Veda.
caturvedādhyāyī bharadvāja iti ca prasiddham eva /	We say that Bharadvaja has studied the four Vedas.
sarvathā tu sopapada evāyurvedādiṣu vedaśabda iti na tattulyakakṣyatā 'dhikṣepakṣetratām atharvavedo netavyaḥ //	Atharva Veda does not stand on the same footing with the Ayur-Veda. Hence it would not be looking down upon as the inferior Veda.
brahmayajñavidhiś ca śrautaḥ caturṣv apy aviśiṣṭa ity uktam /	It has been stated that the Vedic injunction relating to the study of the Vedas touches the four Vedas without any distinction.

tena pramāṇatāyāṃ vedasvādhyāyaśabdavācyatve puruṣārthasādhanavidhāv api catvāraḥ samā vedaḥ //	The knowledge of the Vedas and the art of performing sacri- fices are handed down through the traditional chain. The same law applies to all the four Vedas.
yadi punaḥ auttarādharyeṇa vinā na parituṣyate tat atharvaveda eva prathamaḥ tataḥ paramasya maṃtrasya brahmaṇaḥ praṇavasyābhivyakteḥ /	We shall no more discuss this point. The four Vedas enjoy the same level of dignity and sanctity since they are equally valid, become alike the object of holy study and constitute means to the realization of human ends.Validity of the Atharva Veda Frimacy of the Atharva Veda If y you do not get satisfaction without knowing the sequence of the Vedas then we say that the Atharva Veda is the first in order of time. The mantras of the other Vedas and the syllable 'om' signifying the Absolute have subsequently emerg- ed.

The passage runs thus. Brahma ha vā. aksaramudakrāmat etc. It clearly shows that the syllable 'om' manifested itself in the mind of Brahman at a later period when he had become fatigued with the study of the Atharva Veda.
tathā mahāvyāhṛtīnāṃ śākhāntaraprasiddhānāṃ aprasiddhānāṃ ca bṛhad ityādīnāṃ tata evotthānam //	The three great mantras, viz., om bhuḥ svāḥā, om bhuvaḥ svâhâ and om svah svähä and the well-known musical note called Brhati have sprung up from the Atharva Veda.

It has been stated in a law book that one who has been cere- moniously initiated into the study of the Atharva Veda is enti- tled to read the other three Vedas but one who has been cere- moniously initiated into the study of the other three Vedas is not entitled to read the Atharva Veda.

A religious student, being ceremoniously initiat- ed into the study of the Vedas, should study the three Vedas for a period of 36 years, residing at the house of his preceptor. Another alternative injunction is found in the 3rd chapter of the Manu-samhitã.
vedānadhītya vedau vā vedaṃ vā 'pi yathākramam iti ekasmin vede dvādaśavarṣāṇi vratam dvayoḥ caturviṃśatiḥ trayāṇāṃ ṣaṭtriṃśad iti /	One should observe the vow of absolute celibacy for a period of 12 years in order to study a single Veda. He should observe it for 24 years if he studies the two Vedas. He should do it for 36 years if he studies the three Vedas.
yas tu caturo vedanadhīte tasya aṣṭacatvāriṃśadvarṣam vedabrahmacaryam upāsīta iti smṛtyantaram asti na ca tadāryairnādṛtam /	There is also another injunction in 539540 Nyāyamanjari vow of another Śruti work that one should observe the celibacy for a period of 48 years if he studies the four Vedas.
tatra trivedādhyāyinām eva prativarṣaṃ ṣoḍaśavarṣāṇi vrataṃ cared iti vyākhyānam asaṅgatam upakramavirodhāt anupayogāc ca /	It purports to enjoin that a religious student should observe the vow of celibacy for a period of 16 years in order to study each of the three Vedas.

The scope of this injunction is not restricted to the choice of the length of time, i.e., the period of 12 or 16 years for the study of a single Veda. The Second interpretation of the injunction is disregarded since it comes into conflict with another Vedic injunction. One should institute the sacrifice of Agnihotra when his hair does not turn grey.
triṣu vedeṣv idaṃ vratam na punar eṣv eva triṣv iti niyāmakaṃ vacanam asti //	The three Vedas may be other than the Atharva Veda. But it does not import a bare denial. It does not purport to convey that one should not read the Atharva Veda.

The three Vedas have not been specified by him. It has not been clearly stated that one should observe this vow in order to study the Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Sama Veda.
atharvaṇas tu atharvaśiro 'dhyayanamātralabdhapaṅktipāvanabhāvasyaikadeśapāṭhino 'pi tatrādhikāra upapadyate /	In that sentence there are three adjectives viz., Veda-paraga (one who has gone from one end to the other end of the Veda).
darśitaṃ cātharvaśirodhyayanamātrād api piṅktipāvanaś ca śrāddhabhojane 7nadhikṛta iti vipratiṣiddham //	This injunction seems to us to be the second alternative in order of importance because the first injunction declars that Brahmins who have made the complete study of the Veda should be invited in a feast to be held on the completion of Sraddha ceremony.

We have proved to the hilt that the Atharva Veda is one of the Vedas. But the author of the Tantra-värttika makes542 Nyāyamanjari such remarks about the Atharva Veda as shows that he acknowledges it to be the Veda only out of compassion.
tasmāt nātharvaviṣedhārtham etadvākyam iti //	Such remarks do not make an appeal to us.

They are as follows - Ișți (a sacrifice demanding the services of the performer of the sacrifices and four priests only), Pasu (a sacrifice in which animals are slain), Ekäha (a sacrifice which lasis for one day only), Ahīna (a kind of Soma sacrifice which lasts for many days) and Sattra (a kind of Soma sacrifice which is performed by the co-operation of many persons).

The objection has been very fair and nicely put! We may also put this question to the objectors that if these injunctions are found in the Atharva Veda then why do the other Vedas accommodate them? Moreover, we fail to understand the real target of your attack.

tatra vaihārikī nāma anekartvigāśritanāṃ ekakriyāṇām upadeśaḥśrutau /	When many priests co-operate toEquality of the four Vedas perform a Vedic rite the co-operative activity of the priests is called vaihảrikî vṛtti.
ekavrahmartvigāśritāstu śāntyādikriyāḥ smṛtāvityabhūmijñoktir eṣā //	The Dharma-Sastras hold that the rites for averting evils etc. should be done by the Brahma priest alone.
trayyeva ātmīyagocaretyetad api paramamādhyamsthyam / na hy ātmīyaḥ erakīyo vākaścid asti vedārthah sarvaśākhāpratyayatvād ekasya karmaṇaḥ /	The remark that the rites, prescribed by the three Vedas are performed only by their own priests clearly indicates the breach of impartiality on his part for all the four Vedas. The Vedic rites cannot discriminate between the priests proficient in the three Vedas and those well-versed in the Atharva Veda since one and the same Vedic rite has also been instructed by all the Vedas.
tasmāt samānayogakṣematvāt sarvavedanāṃ ekasya tataḥ pṛthakkaranaṃ vedanindāprāyaścittanirmayadhiyām eva cetasi parisphurati na sādhūnāmityuparamyate //	Hence all the Vedas have the same authoritative power. But those who do not care to atone for their sin arising from despising the Veda can differentiate a particular Veda from the other Vedas. Those who are morally good do not think in this way.

As birds perch upon branches, adorned with flowers and fruits and drink their honey so the people of the twice-born classes read the different recensions of the Vedas and enjoy the sweetness of their composition.

"Do you think of the Purana, History and Dharma Šāstras? Or, do you think of the Agamas of the Saivas, the Pasupatas, the Pañcarátras, the Bauddhas, the Jainas and of the other sects?" We shall subsequently discuss the problem of the validity of Agamas of the Saivas and others.
manvādipraṇītāni dharmaśāstrāṇī vedavat tadarthānupraviṣṭaviśṭakarmopadeśīni pramāṇam eva /	Some critics come forward and say that the Dharma Sastras, written by Manu and others, are absolutely true because they give us advice on rituals cast in the Vedic mould to be performed by us.
kasteṣu vicāraḥ teṣāṃ tu pramāṇatvaṃ vedamūlatvenaiva kecid ācakṣate //	They further add that the above Šāstras derive their validity from the Vedas.

It is notDiscussion on the Validity of Agamas, Tantras etc. reasonable to believe that Manu and others have been taught by some other persons to compose their works.

If we hold that the works of Smṛti are not based upon a sound basis and assume that they are based upon a series of instructions then they will be inevi- tably a memorandum of instructions for ignorant persons. It is unfair to assume that Manu and others have imparted ins- tructions to us with the motive of deceiving us since there is nothing to contradict their instructions.
tasmāt pāriśeṣyāt vedākhyakāranamūlā eva bhavitum arhanti manvādideśanāḥ taddhyanuguṇaṃ samarthaṃ ca kāraṇam iti /	We have already discussed this point, Eliminating all the possible hypotheses we stick to the last hypothesis that the works of Manu and others should be based upon the Vedas. The Vedas are the proper and competent source of them.
tad āha bhaṭṭaḥ abhrānteranubhavādvā 'pi puṃvākyādvipralaṃbhakāt /	If it is far away from facts then it is not convincing.

Some other thinkers hold that they are based upon such recensions of the Vedas as are scattered here and there.
apare punaḥ utsannaśākhāmūlatvam iti //	But still another band of thinkers hold that they are based upon such recensions as have been obsolete.
anena ca viśeṣavivaraṇena na naḥ prayojanam / sarvathā yathopapatti veda eva tatra mūlaṃ prakalpyatām na mūlāntaram apramāṇakatvāt /	But if we are true to our reasoning power then we shall assume by all means that they (Smrti works) owe their existence to the Vedas, the perennial source of truth but not to other sources since there is no proof advanced in favour of the truth of these sources.

How can one assume that the said Smrti text has a corresponding Vedic passage as its basis? In other words, as there is no contradiction in the Vedas so the two conflicting Vedic passages do not exist.
k¬ptam ekatra mūlaṃ itaratra kalpyam /	Kumãrila says to this effect.

Some other thinkers suggest that in cases of conflict between the Vedas and Smrti it is reasonable to give an option. In other words, one may either abide by the decision of the Vedas or by the decision given by Smrti.
apara āha vikalpa evātra yuktaḥ /	This is the sure way of solving the above problem.
kila dvividho vedaḥ śrūyamāṇaḥ anumīyamānaś ca / śrūyamāṇaś ca śrutir ity ucyate /	There are two types of the Vedas viz. the Vedas which are directly heard and the Vedas which are in- ferred are called Smṛti.
dvāv api caitāvanādī iti kiṃ kena vādhyate vyaktāvyakto hi veda evāsau /	As the two types of the Vedas have no beginning so one cannot contradict the other.
ata eva na mantrārthavādādimūlakatvakalpanaṃ yuktam smaryamāṇasya vedasyānāditvāt //	Therefore, it is not fair to assume that mantras and arthāvādas constitute the basis of Smṛti since the Vedas which are being inferred are eternal.

A reply to it is as follows.
uktaṃ hi bhagavatā jaimininā api vā kartṛsāmānyāt pramāṇam anumānaṃ syāt iti //	Jaimini has refuted theDiscussion on the Validity of Agamas, Tantras etc. 547 above view in his Mīmâmsã-Sūtra "Api vā kartṛ-sämänyāt pra- māņam anumānaṁ syād iti”.
kartṛsāmānyād iti ko 'rthaḥ ekādhikārāvagamād iti /	The phrase "kartṛ-sāmān- yat' denotes having the same right'.
ya eva vedārthānuṣṭhāne 'dhikṛtāḥ kartāraḥta eva smṛtyarthānuṣṭhāne /	The persons who are entitled to perform the Vedic rites enjoy the privilege of per- forming rites prescribed by Smrti.
na tvevam ekādhikārāvagamo bāhyasmṛtiṣu vidyate /	But those who follow the dictates of the non-affiliated Smṛtis are not entitled to per- form Vedic rites.
tasmāt manvādismṛtaya eva pramāṇaṃ na bāhyasmṛtayaḥ // nanu mānvādismṛtayo 'pi vedamūlatvāt pramāṇaṃ nānyata iti atrocyate tadetadvadamūlatayā prāmāṇyaṃ yogipratyakṣaṃ dharmagrāhakamamṛṣyamāṇāḥ kilācakṣate bhavantaḥ /	Hence, the Smṛti works of Manu and others are held to be the source of true knowledge but not the non- affiliated Smrtis. Let us now discuss the hypothesis that the law books, com- posed by Manu and others, are the source of true knowledge because they are based only upon the Vedas but not because they derive their truth from the other sources of true knowledge.
etac ca na yuktam yathā hi bhagavān īśvaraḥ sarvasya kartā sarvasyeśitā sarvadarśī sarvānukampī ca vedānāṃ praṇetā samarthitaḥ tathā yogipratyakṣam api dharmagrahaṇe nipuṇamasmadādipratyakṣavilakṣaṇaṃ prayakṣalakṣaṇe samarthitam eva /	You cannot tolerate the view that the principle of merit and demerit is intuited by the trans- cendental perception of the sages. Such an attitude of your mind is illogical. As God has been proved to be the creator of everything and lord of all beings, omniscient and compassionate so the transcendental perception of the sages who enjoy divine grace is competent to have the direct knowledge of Dharma.
tasmāt tanmūlā eva manvādideśanāḥ bhavantu //	Hence they hold that the Vedas are the ultimate source of knowledge of the transcendental objects.
yat tu trikālānavacchinnaḥ kathaṃ partyakṣagamyo dharmaḥ syād iti codanaiva tatra pramāṇam ucyate prativihitaṃ tat īśvarapratyakṣasamarthanena /	It is superflous to know whether or not virtue has an actual being or a potential being. Now, an objection may be raised against the above hypothesis that the Vedas and the Dharma Šāstras are based upon percep tion.
sādhyasādhanasambandhasya svargāgnihotrādigatasya yathā grāhakam īśvarapratyakṣaṃ evaṃ aṣṭakādigatasya tasya grāhakaṃ mantrādipratyakṣaṃ bhaviṣyatīti kim atra trikālānavacchedena avaccheda\ena vā kaṛtyam yad evaṃ aṣṭakādikarmaṇāṃ dharmatvāgrahaṇāt asarvajña īśvaraḥ syāt /	The implication of the above hypothesis is this that God has perceived the sacrifices like Agnihotra etc., as virtuous acts. If this is the implication of the above hypothesis then God's omniscience is at fault since He is unacquainted with the rites like Aṣṭakā etc., as virtuous acts. Or He may be called cruel since He does not communicate it to others though He is directly acquainted with it. The above objection does not impair the hypothesis in question.
jñātvā vā 'nupādaśat akāruṇiko bhavet naiṣa doṣaḥ sarvaṃ jānātyeva bhagavān /	There is no doubt about the hypothesis that God is omniscient. But He does not directly instruct everything.
kiñcit svayam upadiśati kiñcit parānupadeśayati /	He directly teaches some subjects and gets the teaching of subjects done by others.
te hi syānugrāhyā bhagavataḥ /	The persons who are the mouthpiece of God are the blessed sons of God.
teṣāṃ ca tadanugrahakṛtaiva tathāvidhajñānaprāptiḥ /	They acquire such intuitive capacity as enables them to be an instructor only through his grace.
mantrādīnāṃ pratyakṣo dharma iti vede 'pi paṭhyate //	The Vedas also declare that the sages like Manu and others have intuited Dharma.
nanu evaṃ pratyakṣamūlatvāviśeṣāt śrutismṛtyor virodhe vikalpaḥ prāpnoti bṛhadrathantaravidhyor iva na vādhyavādhakabhāvaḥ na hīśvarapratyakṣasya yogipratyakṣasya ca prāmāṇye kaścid viśeṣaḥ /	In that case, as an injunction of the Vedas cannot contradict another injunction of the Vedas though one is clearly opposed to the other so there will be no contradiction between the Vedas and the Dharma Šāstras. Let us take an example from the Sama Veda'. It has been enjoined that a Vedic be sung loudly (the song is to be set to the tune Brhat Saman).
naisargikāhāryakṛtas tu bhaviṣyati /	The one and the same song cannot be sung both loudly and lowly.
kiṃ tena ucyate bhavatu vikalpaḥ /	Therefore there is contradiction between these two injunctions.
ko doṣaḥ vedamūlatvavādibhir api kaścid vikalpo vyākhyāt eva /	But these two injunctions being equally strong one cannot invalidate the other. Therefore in such cases the performer isDiscussion on the Validity of Agamas, Tantras etc.
viṣayavibhāgena vā vikalpo vyākhyāsyate /	But this distinction makes no material difference in the nature of their validity.
na ca śrutismrtivirodhodāharaṇaṃ kiñcid astīti svādhyāyabhiyuktāḥ / tasmād āptapratyakṣamūlatvena vedānām iva dharmaśāstrāṇām api pramāṇyam //	The sound Vedic scholars assert that there is no illustration of conflict between the Vedas and Smrti. Thus as the Dharma Šăstras are based upon the perception of the trustworthy persons so they are true.
itihāsapurāṇaṃ hi pañcamaṃ vedam āhuḥ /	Some authoritative persons say that the Puranas are the fifth Veda.
uktaṃ ca itihāsapurāṇābhyāṃ vedaṃ samupabṛhayet / bibhetyalapaśrutādvedaḥ māmayaṃ pratariṣyati iti //	It has been stated that History and the Purăņas should supple- ment the Vedas since the Vedas apprehend that the ignorant persons will lay blame on them.
atha vā kim asmākaṃ durabhiniveśena vedamūlatvāt smṛtīnāṃ smṛtivat purāṇānām api bhavatu prāmāṇyam /	We may agree with the Mīmāṁsakas in this point that Smrti is true since it is based upon the Vedas and the Purāṇas are also true since they like Smrti are based upon the Vedas.
sadācārasyāpyanupanibaddhasya vedamūlatvād eva bhavatu prāmāṇyam // sarvathā tāvat vedāścatvāraḥ purāṇaṃ smṛtir iti ṣaḍimāni vidyāsthānāni sākṣātpuruṣārthasādhanopadeśīni pūrvoktarītyā pramāṇam /	By all means the six sources of knowledge, viz., the four Vedas, Smrti and the Puranas, furnish us with the instructions of the proximate means to human ends. The six auxiliary branches of the Vedas headed by grammar supply us with the key to open the store-house of knowledge. They remain always subordinate to the principal branches of study and being rightly applied, become help- ful to their understanding.
vyākaraṇādīni tu ṣaḍaṅgāni aṅgatvenaiva tadupayogīni na sākṣāddharmopadeśīni / kalpasūtreṣv api vikṣiptakarmatramaniyamasaṃgrahamātram nāpūrvopadeśaḥ /	But they do never directly teach Dharma. No new instructions can be had from the Kalpa-sūtras.550 Nyāyamanjari They simply inform us of the proper order of the disorderly many subsidiary rites as means to a principal act.
mīmāṃsā vedavākyavicārātmikā / vedapramāṇyaniścayahetuś ca nyāyavistara ity āmukha evoktam /	Mīmāṁsā is a discursive work which determines the meaning of a Vedic sentence. Nyäya Śāstra purports to establish the truth of the Vedas.
tad imāni caturdaśavidyāsthānāni pramāṇam /	In fine, we say that these fourteen sources of knowledge are regarded as authentic.
kānicit sakṣād upadeśīni kānicit tadupayogīnīti siddham //	Some of them initiate us into the proximate means to human ends and the rest teach us the remote means to human ends.
yāni punar āgamāntarāṇi paridṛśyante tāny api dvividhāni kānicit sarvātmanā vedavirodhenaiva pravartante bauddhadivat / kanicit tadavirodhenaiva kalpitavratāntaropadeśīni śaivadivat //	The demonstration of the authenticity of the Agamas of the Saiva, the Pāñcarătra and such other Schools Various other Agamas are noticed by us. They generally admit of two types. Some Agamas are absolutely opposed to the Vedas, viz., the Agamas of the Buddhist school.
tatra śaivāgamānāṃ tāvat prāmāṇyaṃ brūmahe tadupajanitayāḥ pratīte sandeha-bādhakāraṇa-kāluṣyakalāpasyānupalambhāt /	But they teach new rites which have been suggested by them. The Ãgamas of the Saiva school illustrate the second type of Agamas.
īśvarakartṛtvasya tatrāpi smṛtyanumānābhyāṃ siddhatvāt /	It has been established by the Dharma Šāstras and inference that these Agamas have been composed by God.
mūlāntarasya lobhamohādeḥ kalpayitum aśakyatvāt /	We cannot imagine that they owe their origin to greed, delusion and such other sinister motives.
vedavad ekadeśasaṃvādāś ca bhūmnā dṛśyanta iti kuto mūlāntarakalpanāvakāśaḥ //	Some doctrines of the Šaiva system of thought are in perfect agreement with those of some sections of the Vedas.
na ca vedapratipakṣatayā teṣām avasthānam vedaprasiddhacāturvarṇyādivyavahārāparityagāt //	They do not challenge the authority of the Vedas since they do not discard the caste-system etc., accepted by the Vedas.

pañcarātre 'pi tenaiva prāmāṇyam upavarṇitam / aprāmāṇyanirmittaṃ hi nāsti tatrāpi kiñcana //	But this approval of the authenticity of the Pancarătra school is also hinted at since there is nothing to discredit the truth of the scriptures of this school.

vede ca pade pade eka eva rudro 'vasthe na dvitīyaḥ idaṃ viṣṇur vicakrame iti rudro viṣṇuś ca paṭhyate /	In the Vedas there are repeated references to the hypothesis that Rudra is only one without a second; and Visņu strides over this world. It is also stated that Rudra is Vişņu.
tadyogāś ca tadārādhanopāyā vede 'pi coditā eva / śaivapañcarātrayos tu tadyogā evānyathopadeśyante /	As they are held to be in charge of creation, preservation and destruction so the ways and means of worshipping them have been prescribed in the Vedas.
na caiṣa eva vedavirodhaḥ / vaikalpikatvād upāyānām /	Such a difference does not imply that the scriptures of these schools are in conflict with the Vedas since the methods of worshipping God are merely optional.

saṃsāramocakāḥ pāpāḥ prāṇīhiṃsāparāyaṇāḥ /	The Buddhist saints who are indifferent to the worldly plea- sures are addicted to animal slaughter.

How do you meet this argument? It is refuted thus.

But he does not recommend the truth of the Agamas of the Buddhist school. How will these Ägamas be accepted as works of the trust- worthy persons ? The motive behind the composition of these texts may be clearly stated. Ignorance, greed and such other motives play an important part in their composition. With this remark the Buddhists who challenge the authority of the Vedas should be excluded from the list of the trust-worthy persons (āptas).
āha ko 'yaṃ mahājano nāma kim ākāraḥ kim āspadaḥ kiṃsaṃkyaḥ kiṃsamācāraḥ iti vyākyātum arhasi // api ca bauddhādayo buddhādīnāptān svāgamaprāmāṇyasiddhaye vadanti mahājanam api nijam /	The Buddhists review this stand and say. "Who is an authoritative person? What is his appearance? How much is the number of such persons? What is his con- duct? Answer these questions." Moreover, in order to establish the truth of their scriptures the Buddhists hold that Buddha is a trust-worthy person.

Does this question amount to this? How do his hands and feet look like? Or, how do his head and neck look like?Non-authenticity of the Buddhist Scriptures 553 (Our simple answer is this that all his limbs bear a close resemblance to those of a human being).

The authoritative persons who adhere to the laws of caste-system and the duties of four stages of life are as old as the Vedas are.

Thus they cannot claim that they have got hundreds of millions of great men as their own. But the great men who adhere to caste- system etc., discard such Agama nas as are hostile to the Vedas but do never join hands in their praise.

vedadharmānuvartī ca prāyeṇa sakalo janaḥ / vedabāhyas tu yaḥ kaścit āgamo vañcanaiva sā //	Almost every body follows the dictates of the Vedas. An Agama, non-affiliated to the Vedas, is a trick to mislead people.

vedaprāmāṇyasya ca mahajanaprasiddhyaiva siddhatvāt kiṃ śāstreṇa alaṃ kṣudracodyair īdṛśaiḥ mahājanaprasiddhiṃ hi kecidviplāvyanty api /	If the task is done by the approval of the great men then what is the necessity of compo- sing the said logical system. Enough of these superficial objec- tions! There are a few heretics who contradict the veracity of the Vedas accepted by the great men.

It is met thus. All Agamas are equally true since they have been composed by trust-worthy persons. One Agama cannot cantradict another Agama since a weak spot is noticed in none of them.

But the just opposite acts have been enjoined by some other Vedic injunctions. Moreover, the Agamas are not really opposed to one another since they do not disagree in pointing out the goal of human life.
nānāvidhāragamamārgabhedaiḥ ādiśyāmāna vahavo 'bhypāyāḥ /	✔ The Agamas are many. The roads to the goal of life, they prescribe, are also many.
ekatra te śreyasi saṃpatanti sindhau pravāhā iva jāhnavīyāḥ // tathā hy apavarga upeyaḥ sarvaśāstreṣu nirdiśyate /	But they all converge upon the same goal of life as many rivers carrying different currents of water flow into the same ocean.On the Authenticity of the Agamaśāstra In all the systems of thought final emancipation has been declared to be the only ultimate goal of human life.
tadupāyaḥ sarvatra jñānam upadiśyate / jñānaviśaye tu vivadante /	But they differ from one another in selecting various forms of knowledge as ways and means to that end.

naitrātmyavādinas tu ātmaśaithilyajananāya tathopadiśanti / svacchaṃ tu jñānatattvaṃ yatair iṣyate tat svātantryāt anāśritatvāt ātmakalpam eva /	Those who preach the doctrine that the soul does not exist make a show of refuting the existence of a soul, But they believe in the existence of pure consciousness (consciousness which is not mixed up with feelings, passions, desires, impressions etc.). This consci- ousness has its independent existence, i.e., it is not a by-product of matter.
kūṭasyanityatve pravāhanityatve ca viśeṣaḥ //	It does not rest upon another object as its locus.

Another Agama may prescribe to carry a stick and a water-pot. Another Agama may teach its followers to remain naked. But do these diverse teachings suggest that the Agamas are at war with one another? Do not the Vedas enjoin the different ways of attaining Heaven? Hence though the Agamas hold contrary views yet this opposition does not contradict their validity.
ataś ca yad ucyate kapilo yadi sarvajñaḥ sugato neti kā pramā athobhāvapi sarvajñau matabhedastayoḥ katham iti tadapāstaṃ bhavati pradhāne sati bhedābhāvāt /	Now, an objection is raised against this solution. How do you correctly know if Kapila is omnis- cient then Sugata is not omniscient. Again, if both of them are omniscient why do they hold contrary views ? Such an objection is met thus.

Let one's heart trouble, thinking of the killing of enemies enjoined by the Vedas since carnage is its end and personal gain is its motive.

People undertake such actions, being inspired by the Vedas. A compa- ssionate person entertains a doubt, even in such cases, about the validity of such injunctions.
vadati ca yatra prāṇivadho dharmastvadharmaḥ tatra kīdṛśaḥ iti / na caitāvatā vedasyāprāmāṇyam /	They say "If animal-slaughter is a religious act, which act will be an irreligious one? The truth of the Vedas is not discredited in spite of the inclusion of such disputed injunctions.

It has been stated that though one attains communion with Siva yet he will be punished in the future because he has done prohibited acts. Such criticisms are not fair since these acts have not been prohibited by the Agamas in question.
āgamāntaraniṣiddhatve 'pi vaikalpikatvakalpanopapatteḥ /	Though the said acts have been prohibited by the other Agamas yet they may be taken as optional ones.

Or, we may assume for the sake of an argument that the act which has been prescribed by a particular Agama and at the same time condemned by the other Agamas may be productive of evil consequences in the future.
śyenenābhicaran yajeta ity atra abhicaran iti śatālāṅghetaniṣedham adhikāriṇamācaṣṭE /	The injunction that one should perform Syena sacrifice, intending to kill an enemy points to a deeper mean- ing.

The abolition of caste- system should not be literally taken. There is a rule in the Buddhist scriptures that a sick man or a man of very low birth should not be admitted to mendicant orders.

It is a truism that they do not honour the other Āgamas as much as they do the Vedas. Be- cause God is directly aware of the subconscious mind with its tendencies of a few persons, chalked out a path for them, and blessed them with His instructions.

Our reply to this question is this: "Just approach the Mimāṁsakas who bear a grudge against the other Agamas to find out an answer.
pratyuktaṃ ca viruddhatvaṃ śākhānantyāc ca durgamam //	As the Vedic literature is infinitely large so it is difficult to establish the said discrepancy.

How do you know for certain that the views which we do not accept do not correspond to those to be found in the other branches of the Vedas ? The Samkhyas hold that Prakṛti is constituted by three gunas, viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.

evaṃ raktapaṭaparigrahabhasmakapāladhāraṇādimūlam apy abhiyuktā labhanta eva //	The Vedic scholars notice the germs of a few customs such as putting on red cloths, besmearing the whole body with ashes, using the skull of a dead man as a pot and so on in the Vedic literature.
manvādismṛtivat kartṛsāmyasyāsaṃbhave 'py ataḥ / pramāṇaṃ vedāmūlatvāt vācyā sarvāgamasmṛtiḥ //	Though the followers of some Agamas do not perform the Vedic rites like the adherents to Manu's Smrti yet those Agamas are the source of true knowledge since they are based upon the Vedas. Hence all the Agamas should be treated as Smrti.
tataś ca [ yaḥ kaścit kasyacid dharmo manunā parikīrtitaḥ /	Manu in some places teaches the duty of an individual. Such teaching is not the product of his imagination.

The names of the other authors of Smrti should also be taken into consideration. Gautama, Yama, Apastmba, Samavrta, Kathaka and others should also command our respect.
nanu ca lokāyatādyāgame 'py evaṃ prāmāṇyaṃ prāpnoti /	A germ of the materialistic doctrine is noticed in the Vedic literature.

No consciousness persists after the destruction of a body. No soul is immortal from this point of view. The continuity of consciousness is absurd.

One should not follow the round of duties prescribed by the Vedas. One should not place his confidence in the teachings of the Vedas. What has been taught by the materialists has been refuted. The materialistic philosophy is based upon the prima facie view stated in the Vedas but not upon the conclusive views of the Vedas.
tathā ca tatra uttarabrāhmaṇaṃ bhavati [na vā are ahaṃ mohaṃ bravīmi avināśī vā are 'ṣmātmā mātrāsaṃsargas tv asya bhavati] iti /	In the Brhadaraṇyaka Upanişad the concluding portion of the doctrine of soul runs thus:-"I do not intend to mislead you, misrepresenting the doctrine of soul. The soul is imperishable.
tad evaṃ pūrvapakṣavacanamūlatvāt lokāyataśāstram api na svatantram / uttaravākyapratihatatvāt tu tadanāharaṇīyam /	Therefore the books on materialism do not represent an independent point of view since they embody the superficial view of things, stated in the Vedas in order to be refuted.
śāstrāntarāṇāṃ tu pūrvapakṣavākyamūlatvakalpanaṃ ayuktam /	But it will be improper on our part to assume that the views represented in the other Agamas are based upon the prima facie views, stated in the Vedas since no corresponding counter-conclusions are noticed in the Vedas.
samanantaram eva tatpratipakṣavacanānupalabdheḥ ity ataḥ vedamūlatvāt sarvāgamāḥ pramāṇam //	Therefore, all Agamas are authentic since they are based upon the Vedas. The proving of the hypothesis that a particular Agama is not authentic Now, a fresh problem arises in our mind.
sarvāgamapramāṇatve nanv evam upapādite / aham apy adya yat kiñcit āgamaṃ racayāmi cet // tasyāpi hi pramāṇatvaṃ dinaiḥ katipayair bhavet /	If the validity of all Agamas is thus established then a new book which I write may be accepted as authentic within a few days. The reasons which have been stated above are also applicable to it.
jagatpustakalikhitaṃ yad api tad api kiñcid idānīṃ kenāpi dhūrtena prakhyāpyate maha nayam āgama iti /	The book which is very old is reported by some cunning fellows as a new one. The Agamas are held to be authentic if they satisfy the following conditions : (1) They must attain celebrity among the circle of the great persons.
kṛtaś ca bahubhir yeśāṃ śiṣṭair iha parigrahaḥ //	(2) They must be accepted by a large number of men of good conduct.
adya pravartamānāś ca nāpūrvā iva bhavanti ye / yeṣāṃ na mūlaṃ lobhati yebhyo nodvijate jataḥ //	(3) Though they may have been recently composed yet they should not instruct such conduct as appears to be unprecedented. (4) The greed of money should not be the motive of their composition.

tathā hi amitaikapaṭanivītāniyatastrīpuṃsavihitabahuceṣṭam / nīlāmbaravratam idaṃ kil kalpitam āsīt viṭaiḥ kaiścit //	So goes the rumour that some designing persons intro- duced a festival known as Nīlămbara vratam (a black curtain festival). They used to hang up a curtain. Behind the screen a large number of men and women used to mix freely with one another and to enjoy promiscuous relation with no regard for moral codes.

They have been so composed that no defects which have been ascribed to them by the philosophers of the rival schools belong to them. Thus validity has been firmly assured of them. The other Sastras are true since either they are based upon the Vedas or they have been composed by the trustworthy persons.
nanu nādyāpi vedasya prāmāṇyaṃ suvyavasthitam /	But under no circumstances one can point out defects in the Vedas on the ground that the Vedas are not based upon a source book.
svadehasaṃbhavair eva doṣairanṛtatādibhiḥ //	The body of the Vedas suffers from many defects such as falsehood, etc.
[citrayā yajeta paśukāmā] [putrakāmaḥ putreṣṭyā yajeta] iti śrūyate /	+ One who is desirous of getting animals should perform the Citră sacrifice. One who intends to get a son should perform Putresți sacrifice.
na ceṣṭyanantaraṃ putrapaśvādiphalam upalabhyate /	On the completion of these sacrifices the performer does not invariably obtain the result.
tasmāt asatyāḥ citrādicodanāḥ //	Therefore the injunctions, prescribing Citra sacrifice and its like, are false.
nanu ca yaḥ paśukāmaḥ sa iṣṭiṃ kuryāt itīyān eva vākyārthaḥ / tatra yāgāt paśavo bhavantīty etad eva durupapādam /	The defender of the truth of the Vedas meets the objection thus. What is the meaning of the first injunction. The sentence proposes to import that he who intends to get an animal should perform the above işți.
te ca bhavanto 'py anantaram eva bhavantīty etat durupapādataram /	We are to prove that one obtains animals just after the conclusion of the said isti.

In the injunctions, viz., "One should perform a sacrifice as long as he lives". "One should offer libation as long as he lives" nothing is stated about the prolongation of the life of the performer of a sacrifice since life is not the result of such actions.
paśūnāṃ tataḥ karmaṇaḥ siddhim anavabudhyamānasya tatrādhikāra eva na saṃpravartate iti nirṇepyate etat //	When one knows for certain that he cannot gain animals by means of the said sacrifice he may not perform the sacrifice.

āha ca [yadā tāvad iyaṃ vidyamānā ''sīt tadā phalaṃ na dattavatī yadā phalam utpadyate tadā 'sau nāsti asatī kathaṃ phalaṃ dāsyati] iti // api ca kālāntare phalasyānyat pratyakṣaṃ kāraṇam upalabhyate sevādi /	When an act had existed it did not yield its result. When the said result is produced the act does not exist. In that case how can we causally connect a sacrifice with the result? How will a sacrifice yield the result, having perished at the time of its fruition ? Moreover when the said result is obtained in some other time some other tangible causes are noticed to condition it.
tasmiṃś ca kāraṇe dṛṣṭe sati ko nāma sūkṣmadṛṣṭiḥ adṛṣṭaṃ citrādi kāraṇaṃ kalpayet tasmād asatyāḥ citrādicodanāḥ pratyakṣādipramāṇaparicchedayogyārthopadeśitve saty api tatsaṃvādaśūnyatvāt evaṃvidhavipralabhakavākyavat // citrādivacasām evaṃ apacārasya darśanāt /	As such a visible cause is noticed so no person of clear understanding will subscribe to the hypothesis that a sacrifice like Citră, etc., the result of which is not tangibly established produces the said result. Thus we hold that the injunctions which prescribe sacri- fices like Citrã, etc., are false. We cannot pin our faith in the truth of the Vedic injunction which prescribes sacrifices like Citrã, etc., since they do not yield the promised result.
anāśvāso 'gnihotrādicodanāsv api jāyate // agnihotracodanā mithyā vedaikadeśatvāt citrādicodanāvat /	The injunctions which prescribe Agnihotra, etc., are false since they are part and parcel of the Vedic sentences like the Vedic injunctions enjoining sacrifices like Citrã, etc.
tad atra tāvad asaṃvādāt aprāmāṇyam //	They are not held to be true because there is no agreement between a promise and its fulfilment.
evaṃ [putrakāmaḥ putreṣṭyā yajeta] ity evamādāv api asaṃvādo draṣṭavyaḥ //	It should also be noted that there is also discrepancy between an injunction and its result in case of the Vedic injunctions "One who deserves to have a son should perform the putra-işți-sacrifice".

The fire is preserved in a pot. After his demise, the pot, containing the said fire, isObjections to the validity of the Vedas } 565 taken to the cremation ground.

If one offers libation after sun-rise then the dog called Syāva licks the content of his liba- tion.
śavalo vā asyāhutim abhyavaharati yo 'nudite juhoti / śyāmaśavalāv asyāhutim abhyavaharataḥ yaḥ samayādhyuṣite juhoti] //	If one offers libation long before sun-rise, Sabala licks the content of his libation. If one offers libation just before sun-rise then the dogs Śyāva and Śabala lick the content of his libation.
na cārthavādamātram etad iti vaktavyam yataḥ vidhānaṃ kalpyate stutyā nindayā ca niṣedhanam /	The defenders of the Vedas cannot hold that these are nominal artha-vādas having nothing to import. The reason behind our statement is this that a praise amounts to an injunction and condemnation indicates a prohibition.
vidhis tutyoḥ samā vṛttiḥ tathā nindāniṣedhayoḥ //	As a praise and an injunc- tion have the same meaning to import so condemnation and prohibition imply the same sense.

Such a contention is not tenable. The specified periods of time have been prohibited. No hour remains in order to be praised by this censure. Therefore the Vedas are false since they impart incompatible instructions, i.e., they involve contradiction.
paunaruktyāc ca [triḥ prathamām anvāha trir uttamām] ity abhāsacodatāyāṃ prathamottamayoḥ sāmidhenyoḥ trir vacanāt paunaruktyam /	The first one of these Samidhenis is called the prathama rk. The last one is called the uttama ṛk. It has been enjoined that the prathama rk is to be repeated three times and the uttama rk is also to be repeated thrice.
sakṛdanuvacanena taprayojanasaṃpatteḥ anarthakaṃ trir vacanam /	If the single recitation of a mantra bears fruit then the thrice recita- tion of the mantra is redundant.
tasmāt ittham anṛtavyāghātapunaruktadoṣakaluṣitatvāt apramāṇaṃ vedaḥ /	Therefore the Vedas are not true since they contain false statements, involve contradiction and encourage idle repetition.

anṛtatve ca sādhanaṃ phalādarśanam / etac cānaikāntikam anyathā 'pi phalādarśanopapatteḥ /	He further adds that the result is not obtained because there may be some defects in the sacrifi- cial act itself or in the institutor of the sacrifice or in accessaries of the sacrifice.
kiṃ vedasyāsatyārthatvād atra phalādarśanam uta kartrādivaiguṇyāt iti na viśeṣahetur asti //	The critics of the Vedas hold that the Vedas are not the source of true knowledge because they make a false declaration of results. But it is not a fact.

Now the critics may contend that as the result does never immediately follow from a sacrifice so the result is not experienced because the Vedas are false. They further add that the said defects in the performer of a sacrifice is not responsible for the non-appearance of the expected result.
na ca tat kākatālīyam āgamena anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ ca tatkāraṇatvadarśanāt //	It is not a case of accidental coincidence. The causality of the said sacrifice has been stated by the Vedas.
putrādis tv aihikam api phalaṃ vastusvabhāvaparyālocanayaiva na sadyo bhavitum arhati /	Some sacrifice yields secular results like a son, etc. If we reflect on the nature of these results then we come to know that these results cannot be produced at once.
na hi nabhasas tadānīm eva vṛṣṭir iva nipatati putraḥ strīpuṃsasaṃyogakaraṇāntarasavyapekṣatvāt tadutpatteḥ /	A son does not fall from the sky like drops of rain. The union of a man with a woman is one of its necessary conditions. So a son is not born just after the com- pletion of a sacrifice.
paśuādiprāptis tu kasyacit adūrakāle 'pi dṛśyate pratigrahādinā /	It is also seen that somebody receives a gift of animals just after the completion of a sacrifice. Let us cite an example.
tathā hy āsmatpitāmaha eva grāmakāmaḥ sāṃgrahaṇīṃ kṛtavān / sa iṣṭisamāptisamanantaram eva gauramūlakaṃ grāmam avāpa //	Our grandfather desirous of owning a village performed a sacrifice known as Samgrahaņi. He obtained the village of Gauiamūlaka just after the completion of the sacrifice.
nanu evaṃ tarhi pratigrahādy eva dṛṣṭaṃ kāraṇam astu paśvādeḥ /	woman Now, the critics raise another problem. Let the acceptance of a gift be the tangible cause of getting an animal, etc.

kim iṣṭeḥ kāraṇatvakalpanayā iti maivaṃ vocaḥ satsv api ca dṛṣṭeṣu kāraṇeṣu tadadarśanāt iṣṭiprayogānantaraṃ caitaddarśanāt //	Is there any necessity of postulating a sacrifice as a cause? Do not argue in this strain. Though the tangible conditions assemble yet the effect is not produced. When the sacrifice is performed the result follows.
iṣṭikṛtaṃ strīpuṃsayogādikāraṇatvam iti niścīyate /	Thus we arrive at the definite conclusion that the union of a man with a woman accompanied by the performance of a sacrifice is the cause of begetting a son.
kiñ ca sevādhyayanakṛṣyādisāmye 'pi phalabhedataḥ / vaktuṃ na yuktā tatprāptiḥ dṛṣṭakāraṇamātrajā //	Moreover, when all persons wait upon their preceptors, readNyayamanjari the books upto the end with equal attention the result differs in degree. Therefore it is not reasonable to hold that the tangible conditions are only responsible for the result.

tasmān nūnam upetavyaṃ atrānyad api kāraṇam // tad uktaṃ [tac caiva hi tatra kāraṇam śabdaś ca] iti //	568 Some thinkers hold a similar view and say that a sacrifice and an injunction enjoining it are to be included in the list.

There are cases when sacrifices are performed without any defect but no result in the shape of getting a son or an animal, etc., follows even in the remote future. In such cases it is to be assumed that a powerful unrewarded action persists from the previous birth and counteracts the fruition of the present action.

api ca vitrātaḥ praśavo bhavanti ity etāvān eva śāstrārthaḥ /	Moreover, the Vedic injunction concerning Citra sacrifice signifies that one obtains animals if he performs it (Citrā sacri- fice).

They also put forward an analogical argument that whenever one presses his limbs he feels pleasure arising from it. But this is the analogical statement of an ignorant person since no result of an ordinary act should be logically compared to that of an act enjoined.
iha kiñcit vidhiphalaṃ bhavati kiñcit kriyāphalam /	An ordinary act yields a particular result but an enjoined act also produces a different result.
kṛpyāddau tu bhūmipāṭanādi kriyāphalam sasyasampattis tu vidhiphalam //	In case of cultivation an improvement upon land is the result of the act of ng. The wealth of harvest is the result of an act enjoined by a sentence.
kaḥ punaḥ kṛpyādau vidhiḥ asti vārtāvidyāyāṃ vṛddhopadeśo vā kaścid vidhiḥ / anvayavyatirekau vā tatra vidhisthānīyau bhaviṣyataḥ //	When do you find an injunction with regard to cultivation? Such an injunction is found in the science on agriculture, or, we learn it from the experts. Or, we learn it from the joint method of agreement and difference which is a substitute for an injunction.

The result, produced by the act, is rice. But he who obeys the injunction gets salary which is its result. A law which governs all acts is this that an effect follows an act in close succession.
vidhiphalānāṃ tu vetanādīnāṃ nāsti kālaniyamaḥ /	But in the above illustration there is no definite temporal sequence between an injunction and its result.
iṣṭāv api havirvikārādi kriyāphalaṃ sadyo bhavaty eva / paśuputrādi tu vidhiphalaṃ anavacchinnakālam / ata ev mardanasukhaṃ kriyāphalam iti sadyo bhavati /	One who obeys the above popular injunction does not necessarily get the result i.e., salary just after the completion of the enjoined act. In a sacrifice the immediate result of the act of offering an oblation to fire is a change in the nature of an article offered.
mṛdgatas tu puṃsaḥ sevāphalam aniyatakālam //	A person who massages the limbs of another person irregularly gets the reward of his service.

laukikeṣu vidhiṣv asti na kālaniyamaḥ phale // āyurvedopadiṣṭānām apy aupadhavidhīnāṃ na kriyāvat sadya eva phaladarśanam /	There is no law regarding these injunctions that a result regularly follows from such an injunction at a definite period of time. Prescriptions of medicine have been instructed by the 569570 Ayur-Veda (medical science).
api tu kālāpekṣam eveti na phalānantarye kiñcit pramāṇam //	If one follows any such instruc- tion and takes medicine then he does not instantaneously get its result.

It is generally said that if a person performs a particular sacrifice then he very quickly obtains animals. Such a statement has been made in view of the mental condition of a person who has been suffering from taking bad food for a long time and is in need of animals.
api ca aihikatvaṃ Phalasya tāvatā setsyati na punaḥ kriyāphalavat sadyastvam /	But it is not logically sound. A person who performs the said sacri- fices wishes to have the result. But there is no logical certainty about the speedy result.

If an act enjoined does not bear its fruit even after a long interval of time then some defects or demerits of the institutor stand in the way of its fruition.

We assume that there are three kinds of Vedic rites, viz., (1)Objections to the Validity of the Vedas-Answered some acts produce results in this life, (2) Some other acts bring about irregular results and (3) the rest acts bear fruits in the next life.

If we stick to the hypothesis that we gain animals by means of a sacrifice then we should determine which rite helps us to do so. We are sure that if one performs such rites as bestow on him holy effulgence, etc., he does not gain animals thereby.
citrā ca paśuphalā iha janmani tair na kṛtaiva /	He has not performed the Citra sacrifice which helps him to gain animals in this life.

Now our opponents should explain "How does he gain animals ?" Now, the opponents may contend in the following manner.
yathoktam [varṇā āśramāś ca svakarmaniṣṭhāḥ pretya karmaphalam anubhūya patantaḥ tataśśeṣeṇa viśiṣṭadeśaśrutavṛttavittādiyuktaṃ janma pratipadyante] / naitat yathāśrutaṃ boddhuṃ yuktam na hy anyaphalakaṃ karma dātum īṣṭe phalāntaram /	Some persons who performed the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice and such other sacrifices in the previous birth enjoyed some portion of their fruits after their demise. Merits arising from such acts have not been exhausted. On the strength of stored-up merits they gain animals. Gautama says, "When persons belonging to four castes and four different orders of life discharge their res- pective duties prescribed by the scriptures they enjoy heavenly bliss after their death.
sādhyasādhanabhāvo hi niyataḥ phalakarmaṇām //	A Vedic rite produces a particular result but cannot bring forth another result since an act and its result are causally connected.
tasmāt samūhāpekṣā śeṣavācoyuktir vyākhyeyā bahūni hi karmāṇi varṇā āśramāś ca kṛtavantaḥ /	It refers to many such rites. On the basis of this reasonable assumption we should interpret the passage of Gautama. Persons, belonging to different castes and orders of life, have performed many Vedic rites.
tataḥ karmasamūhāt jyotiṣṭomādiphalaṃ pretyānubhūyate /	Among these rites they enjoy the fruit of Jyotistoma after their death.
tataḥ śeṣeṇa citādinā karmaṇā viśiṣṭaṃ janma pratipadyanta ity arthaḥ /	The other Vedic rites viz., Citrà etc. do not produce result at that time.

Such ownership is neither due to actions other than Vedic ones nor due to the other Vedic rites. As Citră sacrifice irregularly produces its result so the result of Citră sacrifice is not invariably produced in this life.

Or, do you grasp it, examining the nature of Vedic injunctions? Or, do you discover it, reflecting on the nature of the result of such injunctions? Or, do you exercise your sweet will to establish such division? Of these suggestions the first one is not tenable since there is no clear statement indicating the three-fold division of injunctions.
na hy atra aihikatvaṃ pāralaukikatvaṃ aniyatatvaṃ vā kvacit phalasya paṭhitam //	The Vedas do not declare that such-and-such rite yields its result in this life, such-and-such rite brings forth its result in the next life and such-and-such rite irregularly produces its result.
vidhivṛttam api iyad eva yat sapratyayapravartanaṃ nām / tatra idam evaṃkāmena kartavyam ity etāvān liṅarthaḥ /	The function of an injunction is to induce a person to a good action. The subjunctive mood in which a verb, con- tained in the Vedic sentence, is used implies that it should be done in response to his desire.

But an injunction does not imply whether the result which the insti- tutor of a sacrifice intends to have will immediately happen or not. But if we closely examine the nature of the result of a sacrifice then we know that heaven is realised in the next life but not in this life. But, it does not point to the realisation of the result in the next life.
phalasvarūpaparyālocanayā tu satyaṃ svargasya pāralaukikatvam avagamyate na tu paśvāder aniyamaḥ //	The result of Citra sacrifice viz., the gaining of animals does not immediately follow the sacri- fice. A person may cherish a wish to classify results but it has no effective power.

adyākṛtāyāṃ kārīryāṃ na hi devo na varṣati /	It is not a fact that the god of cloud does not send down rain if the Kārīri sacrifice has not been performed today.
janmāntarakṛtā tatra kārīrī kiṃ na kāraṇam //	Why do you not postulate that the Kārīrī sacrifice performed in the previous birth, is responsible for rainfall? Therefore, let the Kārīrī sacrifice be irregular in yielding its result.
tasmāt sā 'py aniyataphalā bhavatu //	Therefore merit alone accounts for the said rainfall.

One derives much pleasure from drinking milk, sour milk etc. The enjoyment of such pleasure is due to merit. Such merit will alone help him to gain animals. For this purpose the performance of Citra sacrifice is not at all needed.
kārīryadhīna odanaḥ citrādhinaṃ dadhīti dadhyodanabhojanasukhasādhanādṛṣṭakāritā paśuvṛṣṭisṛṣṭir bhavatu //	Rice depends upon Kārīrī sacrifice and the gain of animals depends upon Citrā sacrifice. Let one gain animals and have rainfall due to merit alone since the pleasure derived from taking rice mixed milk is effectuated by merit.

If they argue like this then it may be pointed out that the Vedas distinctly declare that Kâriri sacrifice brings forth rain. In that case merit arising from any good action will not explain rainfall. (The draft of this discussion is that the result of Kariri sacrifice appears irregularly.

If this is their contention then on the absence of such a direct statement, e.g., "One who wishes rain should chant the hymn seen by Saubhari etc.", the Vedic rite should produce its result in the next life.
[yadi ca cvobhūte juhuyāt] iti vacanamahimnaiva phale sadyastvamātram adhikaṃ bhavatu na tu tādṛśavacanarahitānāṃ karmāṇāṃ vispaṣṭasiddham apy aihikaphalatvaṃ nivartate //	Moreover, if the secular character of a result is determined only by the authority of the sentence "One should offer libation to-morrow" then the obvious secular character of the result of a Vedic rite, not based upon such an authoritative Vedic sentence, will cease to exist.
yat punaḥ bahusādhāraṇatve vṛṣṭer aihikatvam ucyate tad api paśvādau samānam na hy ātmambharir eva yajamāno bhavati tasyāpi svavāsinī kumārātithibhṛtyādibhojanapūrvakasvabhojananiyamopadeśāt /	If the secular character is asserted of rain because it is to be enjoyed in common by many then the same logic applies to the result of Citră sacrifice, viz., animals. The perfomer of a sacrifice is not necessarily a selfish person since he has been advised to feed his sons and daughters, guests and servants etc.
bahutaropakārakatvaṃ tu vṛṣṭer ity alaṃ tulayā //	But we admit that rain does service to a greater number of people.
yad api pratyāsannatvena kāmyamānatvāt vṛṣṭer aihikatvaṃ kathyate tad api tādṛg eva paśvāder api tathaiva kāmyamānatvāt /	Now, the Mimāṁsakas argue that rain is secular because men long for its speedy setting in, but the same logic applies to animals since they are also coveted in a similar manner.

He who gives food enjoys endless bliss. These instruc- tive words of a sage point to the thesis that merit is the con- dition of bliss in general.
nāpi karmaphalasādhyasādhanabāvaniyamavyavahārollaṅghanam iti //	The accepted moral law that a vedic rite and its result are causally connected is not at all violated.

The scrip- tures also lend their support to this solution. Hence, one should arrive at the conclusion that Kārīrī sacrifice irregularly gives its fruit.
na hi tatkarmāntaraṃ āsaṃsāraṃ pratibandhakaṃ bhavati /	The above-mentioned demerit cannot create a perpetual hindrance.
phalopabhogād dhi tasyāvaśyaṃ kṣayeṇa bhavitavyam / pratibandhake ca kṣīṇī kārīryā svaphalaṃ tadā dātavyam eva /	When it is requited it must terminate. When demerit which stands in the way of the fruition of Kārīrī sacrifice wanes, i. e., when the obstacle is removed Kārīrī sacrifice surely becomes fruitful.
sā 'py adattaphalā na kṣīyata evetyevaṃ janmāntare tatphalasaṃbhavāt tasyā api aniyataphalatvam //	But it cannot decay without bringing about its result. It will most probably yield its result in the next life. So it cannot but be irregular in producing its effect.

When Citră sacrifice is performed perfectly well but its result is not obtained it is assumed that demerit hinders its fruition.
sarvatha sadyaḥphalatvamātravarjaṃ samānayogakṣemā kārīryā citreṣṭiḥ //	Citrâ sacrifice agrees on all fours with Kārīrī sacrifice with the only exception that Kärīrī sacrifice is capable of producing an instantaneous result.
etena brahmavarcasavīryān nādyagrāmādikāmeṣṭayo 'pi vyākhyātāḥ /	Similarly, we explain the nature of other sacrifices which are performed by persons longing for the spiritual lustre of a Vedic scholar, undissipated semen, food, a village etc.
tasmāt yathāśrutaṃ gautamaṃ boddhavyam //	Therefore, we should accept the literal sense of the above-quoted passage of Gautama's Dharma-sastra.

Such a statement is really illogical. Even though a person sets himself to perform a sacrifice accompanied by all its subsidiary rites yet defects may unwittingly creep in through inadvertence.

Such an adverse criticism is not fair.
tathāpy asty eva saṃskāraḥ puruṣasya tadāhitaḥ // karmajanyo hi saṃskāraḥ puṃso buddhyādivad guṇaḥ /	This invisible potentiality which is produced by a religious act is an attribute of the individual soul like the other ones, e. g., consciousness, etc.

yathendriyādisaṃyogāt ātmano buddhisaṃbhavaḥ / tathā yāgādikarmabhyaḥ tasya saṃskārasaṃbhavaḥ //	As consciousness is generated by the contact of the soul with the sense-organs, etc., so invisible potentiality arises from the performance of sacrifices and similar religious acts.
buddhis tu bhaṅgurā tasya saṃskāras tu phalāvadhiḥ /	The Buddhists hold that tendencies which tend to form habits and reside in Citta (the inner organ) are called Dharma.

na ca niyogaḥ vākyārtha eva apūrvaśabdavācyaḥ tasyopariṣṭād apākariṣyamāṇatvāt //	It should be 'Apūrva- śabdena'.] The Prabhākaras hold that a mandate which is signified by a Vedic injunction is denoted by the term 'Apūrva'. Such a meaning is not tenable.

So, the term 'dharma' has been employed in the sense of another term which denotes a sacrifice and such other good acts. Hence, the final import conveys that a sacrifice is the meaning of the term 'Dharma'. Such a decision is not tenable.
sāmānādhikaraṇyaprayogo 'pi caikātato nāsty eva //	Hence, the terms 'sacrifice' and 'dharma' are not synonymous.

We should interpret the Vedic illustration "Yajñena Yajñam ayajanta deväh", etc., as referring to dharma.
saṃskāro nṛguṇaḥ sthāyī tasmād dharma iti sthitam /	In fine, dharma which is a potentiality is a durable attribute of the soul, encased in a human body.

The truth of this sentence is contradicted by perception since the body of this person is reduced to ashes.
tasya ca svargagamanaṃ bhavaty eva /	It is quite possible for the soul to enjoy heavenly bliss.

The relation of ownership subsists between him and the implements in question. We should not think that these implements are conjoined to the soul since all souls, being all-pervasive, are conjoined to them.
tasmāt sarvatra niravakāśam anṛtatvādidūṣaṇam //	In that case these would have no distinction to mark off the soul in question from the rest.

nindeti na virodho 'tra kaścid vidhiniṣedhayoḥ// abhyāse paunaruktyaṃ ca kāryārthatvād adūṣanam /	When the repetition of the Vedic mantras is necessary, being due to significant regulation it does not amount to the defect of tautology since the Vedic mantras are not repeated for nothing out of caprice.
saṃpādyaṃ pāñcadaśyaṃ hi sāmidhenīṣu coditam //	The Vedas distinctly declare that the number of kindling verses (samidheni) should be fifteen.
[imam ahaṃ pañcadaśāreṇa vajreṇāpavādhe yo 'smān dveṣṭi yaṃ ca vayaṃ dviṣmaḥ ] iti śrūyate /	The mantra "I strike the enemy who hates us and whom we hate in return with this thunderbolt, having fifteen sharp edges" has been given in the Vedas.

tasmāt tatprayojanārthatvāt na punaruktādoṣaḥ //	Hence as the repetition in question has got a definite purpose to serve so it does not suffer from the defect of tautology.
abhyāse phalarahite hi paunaruktyaṃ doṣaḥ syād iha tu na tasya niṣphalatvam /	If the repetition of a mantra is fruitless then it will be open to the charge of tautology. But in the present context the repetition of mantras is not fruitless.

Are these arthavadas literally true? Or, do they advise us to discharge some duty ? Or do they play the part of a means to an end which has been referred to by the Vedic injunctions containing verbs in the subjunctive mood? In any case, they are encircled by inconsistencies on all sides. If one holds that arthavadas contain a record of events which happened then such a statement is contradicted by other proofs.
svarūpaparatve tāvat pramāṇāntaraviruddhārthopadeśāt aprāmāṇyam evāvatarati rodanavapotkhedanadiṅmohāder arthasya tathātve niścayābhāvāt //	Thus the Vedas cannot save themselves from the charge of untruth as they contain such matters as are contradicted. There is no proof in support of the correctness of statements about weeping, the heating of fat, confusion, etc.

na hi nisargata eva sarvaprāṇinām anṛtavādinī vāk bhavati stenaṃ vā manaḥ //	It is a truism that everyday does not naturally tell a lie and that the inner organ of every- body is not prone to theft.

This is another instance of arthavada the subject matter of which is contradicted by perception since the above two objects are perceived when they come in contact with the sense organ.
kiñca [etan na vidmaḥ yadi brāhmaṇāḥ smo 'brāhmaṇā vā ] iti brāhmaṇajāter upadeśasahāya pratyakṣagamyatvāt tadviruddha eṣo 'rthavādaḥ //	It states "We do not know whether we are Brāhmaṇas or not". When we perceive a man we recognise him to be a Brāhmaṇa provided that this act of perception is strengthened by proper instruction.
śāstravirodho 'py asti [ko hi tadvada yady amuṃṣmil loke 'sti vā na vā ] iti/	Some artha- vādas also come in conflict with the scriptures. Let us illustrate582 Nyāyamanjari our point. Who knows what exists or does not exist in the next world.

api ca gargatrirātrabrāhmaṇam adhikṛtya śrūyate { śobhate 'sya mukhaṃ ya evaṃ veda ] iti /	This sentence makes an assertion about the Triratra-Brāhmaṇa seen by Garga. The face of a person who knows this Brāhmaṇa looks very beautiful.
na hi kasyacit evaṃviditaḥ mukhaṃ śobhata iti pratyakṣavirodhaḥ //	But nobody's face looks more beautiful if he knows the Brāhmaṇa.

The text of the arthavāda is as follows One fulfils all his desires if he pours final libation into fire. He who performs the Paśu-bandha sacrifice conquers all the worlds. He who performs the horse sacrifice conquers death, gets rid of all sins and of the sin which arises from the killing of Brāh- maņa.
yadi pūrṇāhutyaiva sarvakāmāvāptiḥ paśubandhayogenaiva sarvalokajayaḥ aśvam eghavedenaiva tatphalāvāptiḥ tat kim artham anyakarmopadeśḥ upadiṣṭāny api tāni bahukleśasādhyāni karmāṇi vyarthāni bhaveyuḥ anenaiva laghunopāyena tatphalaprāpter darśanāt //	He who is acquainted with the text dealing with the horse-sacrifice gets all these benefits. If the pouring of final libation alone is sufficient to fulfil all desire, if the conquest of all worlds is only possible through the performance of the Pasu- bandha sacrifice and if the knowledge of the text dealing with the horse-sacrifice confers on us the full benefit of the perfor- mance of the horse sacrifice then what for are these instructions regarding the performance of the other Vedic rites? The Vedic rites which have been instructed in the Vedas should sink into insignificance though one is to take a lot of cares and troubles to perform them since the same results are obtained by means of the other casier methods. Let another example of arthavada be cited.
api ca [na pṛthivyām agniś cetavyaḥ nāntarikṣe na divi ] iti vede cayananiṣedhe evātra bhaṅgthā bhavet /	Fire should be kindled neither on earth nor in the mid region nor in the sky. The kindling of fire has been prohibited in a roundabout way.
divi cāntarikṣe ca tāvat cayanaprayoga eva nāsti kiṃ tanniṣedhena pṛthivīcayananiṣedhārthaṃ ca yad vākyaṃ tat cayanapratiṣedhārtham eva bhavet apṛthivvydhikaraṇakasya cayanasyānupapatteḥ //	It is impossible to kindle fire either in the mid-region or in the sky. Is the denial of kindling fire in either places significant ? The sentence which purports to prohibit the kindling of fire on earth should be taken as the universal prohibition of the kindling of fire since the kindling of fire is only possible on carth. Let another illustration of arthavada be quoted.
nāpi tebhya eva kāryarūpārthaparokalpanaṃ upapannam aśakyatvāt/	Such a sugges- tion is not logically sound since the acts which are indicated by the arthavada are not practicable.
[so 'rodīt yad arodīt tad rudrasya rudratvaṃ ] ity atra kāryaṃ kalpyamānam evaṃ kalpyate rudraḥ kira rurodaḥ ato 'nyenāpi roditavyam iti tac cāśakyam priyaviprayogajanitasantāpavaśena hi bāṣpamocanaṃ rodanam ucyate /	He (the lord of gods) wept. As he wept so he acquired the epithet 'Rudra' from the weeping. Now let us assume an act which may be indicated by this sentence. If we are to assume we should assume like this: So goes the story that Rudra wept. Other persons should also weep following his example.
na tat codanopadeśāt kartuṃ śakyate //	One cannot weep because the Sastras instruct him to do so.
prajāpatir ātmano vapām uccikhedaḥ tasmād anyo 'py evam utkhidet ātmano vapām iti duranuṣṭhāno 'yam arthaḥ /	The lord of all creatures heated his own omentum and poured it into fire. So should other persons follow his example, heat their omentum and pour it into fire.
ko hi nāma ātmano vapām utkhidet kasya vā vapāhome sati samanantaram eva hutabhujaḥ paśus tūpara udgacchet iti // devā diśo nājñāsiṣuḥ ataḥ anyo 'pi na jānīyāt iti aśakyopadeśaḥ na hi diṅmoho upadeśāt karyuṃ śakyaḥ //	Who can pour his own omentum into fire after having heated it? If this act is done after whose performance would a goat immediately go up to the sky? Gods were bewildered. There- fore others should be bewildered. Such an instruction cannot be worked out. Nobody can create his own state of bewilderment at the instance of the Sastras.
na ca sarvasmād arthavādāt vidhiḥ kalpayituṃ śakya iti madhyamo 'pi satpakṣaḥ //	We cannot frame injunctions from these artha-vådas. Therefore, the second alternative suggestion is not sound.
nāpi tṛtīyaḥ pakṣaḥ saṃbhavati śakyāntaravihitakāryarūpārthaupayikatvaṃ hi tadupayogidravyadevatādividhānadvārakaṃ bhavati yathā [agnihotraṃ juhoti ] ity atra [dagdho juhoti ] [payasā juhoti ] iti dravyaviniyogavidheḥ [yad agnaye ca prajāpataye ca sāyaṃ juhoti ] iti devatāvidher vā /	The third suggestion is not also possible since it is not easily possible for something to be a means to an obligatory act. An Arthavada may act as an accessory to an injunction if it prescribes or to gods having bearing upon the main obligatory action. Let us cite 583584 Nyāyamañjart an instance in order to clarify the point in question. There is an injunction, viz., "One should perform the Agnihotra sacri- fice". There are other injunctions, viz., "One should pour the libation of sour milk into fire", "One should pour the libation of milk into fire", etc.
na cāyam arthavādeṣu prakāraḥ saṃbhavati /	Thus we see that the arthavādas in question render no help to any injunction.
tasmat na teṣāṃ tadaupayikatvam //	Such a contention is not tenable.
nanu prekṣāvatāṃ prarocanātiśayakaraṇena pravṛttyutsāham āvahantaḥ arthavādāḥ tadupayogino bhaviṣyati naitad api samyak pravṛttyutsāho hi keṣāṃcin mate nirapekṣaśabdapratyayād eva sidhyati / asmanmate tu tatpraṇetṛpuruṣapratyayād iti kiṃ prarocanayā [evaṃkāma idaṃ kuryāt ] yat kiñcid etat //	Some good selves hold that our implicit confidence in the eternality of the Vedas encourages one to undertake an obligatory act prescribed by the Vedas. But the Naiyāyikas assert that as a person has unflinching reverence for the author of the Vedas so he feels encouraged to take up a Vedic action but he feels no necessity of being induced for this purpose. If a person does not move to do on hearing the injunction that one who longs for such and such results should perform such and such acts then he will never budge an inch though temptations are held before him in order to induce him to take up the above actions.
tad evaṃ prakāratrayeṇāpi arthavādapadānām ananvayāt ekadeśākṣepeṇa sarvākṣepa eva kriyata iti apramāṇaṃ vedaḥ // nanu yāvaty eva pramāṇāntaraviuddhatvam upalabhyate tāvaty evāprāmāṇyam astu / sarvatra tu kutastyā tadāśaṅkā iti maivam tat tatsāmānyāt anyatrāpy anāśvāsaḥ /	Therefore as theOn the Validity of the Vedas arthavadas which constitute a portion of the Vedas are contra- dicted so the whole of the Vedas is untrue, 585 Now the defenders of the truth of the Vedas may contend thus The portion of the Vedas which is contradicted by the other sources of valid knowledge may be admitted to be false, But why do you apprehend that the whole of the Vedas is untrue? The critics give a fit rejoinder and hold that as the arthavādas bear a resemblance to the other parts of the Vedas so we disbelieve the truth of the other parts of the Vedas.
mīmāṃsakapakṣe hi arthavādarahitakevalavedagranthānupalambhāt tadanuṣaṅkeṇa sarvatra sāpekṣatvam avatarari /	According to the Mimāṁsakas the Vedas which do not contain arthavādas are not found out. Therefore, the Vedas, being inti- mately connected with arthavadas, are false.

There- fore, the net result is that the Vedas as a whole come under untrue knowledge. A reply to the objection against the veracity of the Vedas since they contain artha-vādas. Our reply to the above objections is as follows. In the majority of cases artha-vādas are so syntactically connected with injunc- tions that they form a single sentence.
teṣāṃ tadekavākyatvād eva prāmāṇyam /	The first of these two is an injunction.
[vāyur vai kṣepṣṭhā devatā ] ity ataḥ yady api kriyā nāvagamyate nāpi tatsaṃbaddhaḥ kaścid arthaḥ tathā 'pi vidhyuddeśenaikavākyatvaṃ tasya pratīyate [bhūtikāmaḥ ] ity evam anto vidhyuddeśaḥ //	The second one is an artha-vâda. Though the sentence signifying praise does neither point to a Vedic rite to be performed nor anything relating to it yet it makes a statement about the injunction in question. Thus, it becomes a predicate of the injunction. The injunction and the artha-väda construct a single sentence.
katham ekavākyabhāvaḥ padānāṃ sākāṅkṣatvāt //	Why do these two sentences construct a single sentence? The reason behind the supposition is this that words which constitute these two senten- ces imply mutual syntactical relation.
nanu [bhūtikāmaḥ ] ity evam antena vākyena vidheyaṃ vihitam utpāditaṃ pratipattur anākāṅkṣatvaṃ kṛtaś ca śabdakartavyam iti kim anyena [kṣepṣṭhā ] ityādinā prayojanam tadarthasyaiva stutir iti brūmaḥ //	There is no incompleteness from the syntactical point of view. Wherein lies the necessity of the other sentence, viz., 'Väyur vai kşepistha etc.? Now it may be replied that the second sentence contains a praise of the rite communicated by the first sentence. In other words, what has been prescribed by the former sentence has been recommended by the latter one.
nanu stutyā 'pi kiṃ prayojanam stuto 'stutaś ca tāvān eva so 'rthaḥ maivam sastutipade hi vākye stutipadasahitaṃ vidhāyakaṃ vidhāyakaṃ bhavati //	Is not the recom- mendation superfluous? It matters little whether praise is bes- towed on the rite or not since the rite always remains the same but acquires no new character if it is recommended.
kim idānīṃ kevalaṃ liṅādiyuktaṃ vākyaṃ na vidhāyakam ucyate yadi stutipadāni na śrūyate tat bāḍhaṃ bhavati vidhāyakam /	If a sentence is simply used in the subjunctive mood, having no words of praise in it then does it not enjoin? If no words of praise are found near about an injunctive sentence then a sentence in the sub- junctive mood surely enjoins.
eteṣu ca satsu tatsahitaṃ tadvidhāyakaṃ bhavati na kevalaṃ tathā pratīteḥ /	Our experience records its evidence in favour of such construction.
anyathā hi pratīyamānaḥ padārthānvayaḥ tyajyeta vākyabhedo vā kalpyate /	If words which constitute a sentence express no correlative meaning then such a sentence should be given up or it should be split up into two or more sentences.
tasmān na stutipadānām ānarthakyam //	Therefore, words denoting praise are not superfluous.
nanu kevalasyāpi vidhivākyasya sāmarthyāt kim arthaṃ stutipadāni prayuñjate iti ucyate aparyanuyojyo jaiminīyānāṃ mate śabdaḥ asmākaṃ ca bhagavān īśvaraḥ /	It runs thus If injunctions disunited with praise are competent enough to prescribe rites, why are praises attached to injunction? Our answer to this question is this. According to the Mimam- sakas, the Vedas are not to be taken to task. According to us God is above all reproaches.
ukte sati pratipattāro vayaṃ vedasya na kartāraḥ /	When the Vedas are recited to usObjections against the Validity of the Vedas-Answered we understand them but we do not compose them.
pratipattau ca kramo darśitaḥ //	For the better understanding of injunctions the function of the artha- vādas has been pointed out.
evañ ca yady api dravyadevatetikartavyatāvidhānadvārakaṃ aṅgavidhivad arthavādavakyānāṃ kāryaupayikatvaṃ nāsti tathāpi pratītyaṅgatvaṃ na nivāryate //	It is a truism that artha-vådas are not means to a Vedic rite like mínor injunctions which prescribe accessories such as articles of worship, gods and other minor details which contribute towards the completion of a principal rite. Still nobody can prevent them from their efficacy in revea- ling the significance of such injunctions.
ata eva pramāṇo prayogitvam eṣām ācakṣate na prameyopayogitvam /	Thus, they help us to maintain the veracity of the Vedas but do not throw light on the subject-matter of the Vedas.
kevalavidhipadaśravaṇe hi na tadādriyante yajvānaḥ / tatra vidhivibhaktir avasīdati / tāṃ nimajjantīm iva arthavādajanitakarmaprāśastyapratyayaḥ uttabhnāti /	When the performers of sacri- fices listen to bare injunctions they find little interest in them. Hearing such injunctions the spirit of prospective sacrificers for whom they are meant droops down. But on hearing the artha- vādas which contain the praise of these acts the sinking spirit is cheered up.
[sarvajitā yajeta ] ity ataḥ na tathāvidhaḥ śraddhātiśayo bhavati yathāvidhaḥ [sarvajitā vai devāḥ sarvam ajayan sarvasyāptyai sarvasya jityai sarvam evaitena sarvaṃ jayati ] ity arthavādapadebhyaḥ /loke 'pi [iyaṃ gauḥ kretavyā ] ity ataḥ na tathā kretāraḥ pravartante yathā [eṣā bahusnigdhakṣīrāsuślīlā sāpatyā anaghaprajā ca ] ity evamādibhyaḥ stutibhyaḥ /	When we hear it do we feel much regard for it? But when we hear the associated artha-vadas such as 'Gods performed the Sarvajít sacrifice in order to win all objects and to conquer all. Every body who performs it conquers all' we cherish much regard for the rite in question. This law also holds good in worldly tran- saction. If persons listen to the injunction: This cow should be purchased' then are they induced to purchase the cow? But if they hear at the same time the praises of the cow, viz., "This cow gives much milk, Her milk is substantial. She is very noble.
svānubhavasākṣiko 'yam arthaḥ //	If one simply asks his own experience, he will understand the efficacy of praises, i.e., artha-vadas.
ata eva kecit aśrutārthavādake 'pi vidhivākye tatkalpanām icchanti yathā kvacit arthavādāt vidhikalpanam iti /	For this reason, some jurists assume artha-vãdas where there are injunctions, i.e., injunctions not associated with artha- vādas just as they in some cases guess injunctions from artha- vādas.
yathoktam [vidhis tulyoḥ sadā vṛttiḥ sāmānaviṣayeṣyate ] iti /	It has been stated that an injunction and praises always co-exist as the latter ones have bearing upon the rite in question.
anadhigamyamanavidhisambandhāc ca arthavādāt vidhir unnīyate na gmyamānasambandhāt // ata eva ca [so 'rodīt ] ityevamādibhyaḥ [na roditavyam ] ityādividhikalpanam iṣyate /	But no injunction is inferred from an artha-vada if such relation bet- ween it (artha-vada) and an injunction is not known to us. 587588 In the light of the above decision we shall not assume the injunction "One should weep" from the artha-vāda "He wept etc." The objector has unfairly made an adverse criticism.
vidhyantareṇaikavākyatvaṃ hi pratyakṣam ihopadiśyate / [barhiṣi rajataṃ na deyam ] ity asya vidheḥ śeṣo 'yaṃ [so 'rodīt ] ityādiḥ [rudro ruroda /	There is an injunction "Silver should not be paid as sacrificial fees in Barhiş sacrifice." The subordinate position is occupied by the artha-vāda in question (i. e., "He wept" etc.) in the above paragraph. The full text runs thus : Rudra had wept.
tasya yadaśru aśīryata tadrajatam abhavat /	His tears which tickled down on the ground became silver.
yo hi barhiṣi rajataṃ dadāti purā 'sya saṃvatsarāt gṛhe rodanam bhavati ] iti /	He who pays silver in Barhiş sacrifice will experience a sad scene of weeping in his house within a year.
tasmāt [barhiṣi rajatam na deyam ] iti //	Hence, silver should not be paid in Barhiş sacrifice.
[prājāpatyam ajaṃ tūparam ālabhate] ity asya vidheḥ śeṣaḥ [prajāpatir ātmano vapām udkkhidat ] iti /	There runs the injunction that one should slay a big sheep, placing it in proper place, in honour of the lord of all beings. Its remaining portion is that the lord of all beings let out his own fat.
vapāhomamāhātmyapradarśanārtham ucyate agnau vai pragṛhītamātrāyāṃ vapāyāṃ ajas tūpara udagād iti //	In order to exhibit the excellence of the libation of fat, it has been stated that as soon as the libation of fat had been poured into fire the goat went up in the sky.
[ādityaḥ prāyaṇīyaś caruḥ ] ity asya vidheḥ śeṣe 'yaṃ [devā vai devayajanamadhyavasāya diśo na prājānan ] iti vyāmohānām ādityaś carur nāśayitā yathā diṅmohasyeti evaṃ tatra tatra vidhiśeṣatvaṃ arthavādānāṃ veditavyam //	There is an injunction concerning 'Prāyaṇiya'. Its concluding portion is that gods were perplexed to find out the sacrificial ground and their obscurity was removed by the above-mentioned milk-boiled rice just as the sun, rising up, removes the bewilderment of persons. Thus, in all cases, the sentences containing artha-vāda (praise etc.) are to be taken as the concluding portions of injunctions.
katham punar idam asatyam evocyate [rudraruditāt rajatam ajāyata] [prajāpatihomasamiddhād agneḥ ajas tūpara udagāt ] iti ucyate nedam asatyam yad asya vākyasya pratipādyaṃ tatra satyartham evedam /	Why do you say that the incidents referred to by artha-vādas are not true? The incidents are that silver sprang up from the tears of Rudra and that a goat went up in the sky when the sacrificial altar had been bright on the pouring of Prajapati's own fat into it. Our reply to the charge of falsehood is that the artha-vādas are not false.
na cāsya yathāśruto 'rthaḥ pratipādyaḥ kintu vidheyo niṣedhyo vā kaścid arthaḥ /	An artha-vāda simply suggests that some work should be done or that some work should be avoided.
ihānvākhyāne dvayam āpatati yac ca vṛttāntajñānam yac ca kasmiṃścid arthe prarocanā dveṣo vā /	These two meanings of artha-vādas will be clear to us if we reconsider their significance. It should also be noted that when we know some incidents we feel fascination for or hatredObjections against the Validity of the Vedas-Answered 589 against some works but the knowledge of these incidents does neither propel not repel us.
tatra vṛttāntajñānaṃ na pravartakam na nivartakam iti prayojanābhāvāt anarthakam anādaraṇīyam /	Therefore; such knowledge should be disregarded as it becomes insignificant, having no useful purpose to serve.
prarocanādveṣau pravṛttinivṛttyaṅgatvāt tadarthau gṛhītvā prarocanāyāḥ pravarteta dvEsān nivarteteti /	Love and hatred are the two motive forces which stir up a person. They are really signified by artha-vadas. For this reason when a person takes the meaning of an artha to his heart, he either moves to do something if he feels fasci- nation for it or refrains from doing it if he feels hatred against it.
tatra tatpratipādyasatyārtha evārthavādaḥ //	Therefore, artha-vădas are truly significant.
yat tu arudati rudre kathaṃ tadrodanavacanam arodanaprabhave vā rajate kathaṃ tadudbhavatā 'bhidhānam iti guṇavādamātram gauṇa eṣa vādaḥ śvetavarṇasārūpyādinā rodanaprabhavaṃ rajataṃ ninditum ucyate //	It purports to convey a meaning through a metaphor. It relates an attribute. The attribute of silver bears a resemblance to that of tears since both of them are white. Silver is as impure as tears since silver is supposed to be an effect of weeping. The possession of the same quality suggests the causal relation subsisting between them.
evaṃ paśuyāge vapāhomapraśaṃsāyai [prajāpatir ātmano vapām udakkhidat ] iti vṛttāntākhyānaṃ yojanīyam //	In order to make this recommendation strong the story that the lord of all beings has heated his own fat to pour líbation into fire has to be interpreted.
ādityacarupraśaṃsāyai [devā vai devayajanamadhyavasāya diśo na prājānan ] iti //	In order to praise rice, boiled in milk, called the sun, the story that gods, having taken their seat in the sacrificial altar, were bewildered, has been narrated.
atha vā naiyāyikānām anekaprakārapuruṣātiśayavādināṃ yathāśrute 'py arthe nātyantam asaṃbhavaḥ /	But the Naiyãyikas told that as the powers of God are in- finite so there will be no absurdity if it is believed that the story is literally true.
rudrasya ruditāt rajatajanma prajāpater vapotkhedaḥ taddhomāt tūparapaśūdgamaḥ devānāṃ devayajanādhyavasāne diṅmoha ity evaṃjātīyakam api satyam astu ko doṣaḥ tatsarvathā nārthavādā na pramāṇam //	We may believe that silver sprang up from the tears of Rudra, the lord of all beings heated his own fat, a goat went up after the libation of fat, and gods were bewif- dered when they had taken their seats on the sacrificial altar. If these stories are true, is there any harm? By all means the artha-vādas in question are true.
evaṃ [stenaṃ mano 'nṛtavādinī vāk ] iti gauṇa eṣa vādaḥ / pracchannatayā stenaṃ mana ucyate /	As the inner organ conceals its own nature so it is called a thief. As the organ of speech indulges in exaggeration so it is called a liar.
vāhulyābhiprāyeṇa cānṛtavādinī vāk iti //	The artha-vāda sentence purports to convey a special meaning.
[dhūma evāgner divā dadṛśe nārcir arcir evāgner naktaṃ dadṛśe na dhūmaḥ ] iti dūrabhūyastvābhiprāyeṇa kasmaicit prayojanāya sāyaṃprātarhomadevatāstutaye kathyate //	The smoke, being voluminous, is seen from a distance but the flame, being slender, is not perceived. The flame of fire increases in volume at night. So it is perceived from a distance. Smoke, being covered by darkness, is not seen at night. This statement has been made to serve a special purpose in the evening and to praise the sacrificial fire in the morning.
[na caitadvidmo yadi brāhmaṇāḥ smaḥ abrāhmaṇā vā ] iti pravarānumantraṇapraśaṃsāyai saṃśaya iva darśitaḥ /	The artha-vāda sentence "We do not know whether we are Brahmins or not" apparently reveals a doubt about one's Brah- manhood in order to praise the act of purifying one's lineage with the utterance of mantras.
abrāhmaṇo 'pi yajamānaḥ pravarānumantraṇena brāhmaṇaḥ syād iti //	The act of consecrating one's lineage with the utterance of incantations is so meritorious that even a non-Brahmin becomes a Brahmin if he observes it.
[śobhate 'sya mukhaṃ ya evaṃ veda ] iti vidyāpraśaṃsaiṣā śobhata iti śiṣyair udvīkṣyamāṇasya mukham iti //	The artha-vāda sentence "The face of one who knows it shines" embodies the praise of learning. The face of a teacher shines when it is looked at by the admiring students.
[sarvān kāmān āpnoti ] iti sarvatvaṃ prakṛtā 'pekṣam /	In ano- ther sentence that he gets all the objects longed for the word 'all' does not denote all the objects in the universe without any restriction.
stutyarthaṃ cāśvamedhādhyāyane tatphalavacanam // [hiraṇyaṃ nidhāya cetavyam ] iti stutyārthatayā divyantarikṣe pṛthivyāṃ ca cayanaṃ pratiṣidhyate /	It should be interpreted with reference to the uni- verse of discourse. It signifies all covetable objects appended in the list of the effects of the Aśvamedha-sacrifice. The state- ment that he who reads the text of the Aśvamedha-sacrifice gets the same reward simply glorifies the said sacrifice.
anupahitahiraṇyāyāṃ pṛthivyāṃ agnir na cetavyaḥ na punar na cetavya eva tasyām iti //	One should not kindle fire at a spot where gold has not been kept inside. The injunction does not mean to say that fire should not be kindled on Earth.
[ādityo yūpaḥ ] iti añjane sati tejasvitayā yūpasya ādityarūpatā stutaye kathyate // tatkāryakāritvāc ca yajamānaḥ prastara ucyate /	The statement that the sacrificial post is the sun purports to convey that the sacrificial post, painted with bright colours and anointed with clarified butter, looks like the sun because a cerc- mony has been stated to be performed, viz., the Kuśa grasses should be spread over the sacrificial altar in its honour sinceObjections against the Validity of the Vedas--Answered the contribution of both of them towards the completion of the sacrifise is of equal importance.
na hi mukhyaiva vṛttyā loke śabdāḥ pravartante gauṇyā 'pi vṛttyā tadvyavahāradarśanat /	People do not always use words in the primary sense. They also employ words in the secondary sense. Our experience testifies to such usages.
evaṃ vede 'pi teṣāṃ tathā prayogo bhaviṣyati /	In the Vedic literature the words will also be similarly used.
itthaṃ ca mantreṣv api aindryā gārhupatyopasthānam aviruddham //	Thus, with regard to Vedic rites if one worships the household fire reci- ting the rks, sung in honour of Indra then he commits no violation of rule.

Similarly artha-vādas which narrate the Vedic rites differently performed by the different persons and record the mythological stories are to be similarly combined with the corresponding injunctions.
kvacit vidhivākyasyārthasandehe arthavādātmakāt vākyaśeṣāt tanniścayo bhavati /	591 In some cases, gaps of injunctions are filled up by an artha- vāda.
ityarthavādā vidhinaikyabhāvāt tadvatpramāṇatvam amī bhajante / asti pratītyanvayita hi teṣāṃ kvacic ca kāryānvayitā tu dṛṣṭā //	Thus they (artha-vadas) not only help the better understanding of injunctions but also supplement the obser- vance of Vedic rites. Let us give an illustration.
yad vā svarūpaparatām api saṃspṛśanta prāmāṇyavartmata ime na parityajanti /	Those who sit the whole night acquire distinction. But the performance of a sacrifice at night has not been prescribed by the injunction in question.
naiyāyikā hi puruṣātiśayaṃ vadantaḥ vṛttāntavarṇam apīha yathārtham āhuḥ //	We learn only from an artha-vāda that person is entitled to perform a sacrifice at night. Jaimini in his Mîmämsä sūtra (phalama- traiva nirdesät) has also said to the effect.
gauṇīṃ tu vṛttim avalambya kṛtā tadarthavyākhyeti teṣv api na viplavanāvakāśaḥ // athedānīṃ mantrā vicāryante kiṃ arthaprakāśanadvāreṇa vidhyarthaopayogitā teṣām utoccāraṇamātreṇa iti //	The sūtra expresses this idea that if an injunction does not enjoin an action and the artha-vāda, associated with it prescribes an action then the action should be duly performed since an artha-vāda supple- ments an injunction. Those who seek after name and fame should perform a particular sacrifice at night.
vākyakramaniyamāc cāvivaksitārthān mantrān avagacchāmaḥ /	We grasp the sense of the complete injunction only through the medium of the said artha-vāda.
niyatapadakramā hi mantrāḥ paṭhyante /	The injune- tion is that one should make an offering of sand anointed with oily substance.
yady arthapratipādanenopakururyuḥ niyatakramāśrayaṇam anarthakaṃ syāt kramāntareṇāpi tadarthāvagamasaṃpatteḥ //	Is it clarified butter or oil or fat? When a doubt spreads over our mind the artha-vâda which is associated with the above injunction comes to our rescue. It helps us to solve the doubt.
itaś cavivakṣitārthā mantrāḥ /	It says that clarified butter is a luminous594 should be referred to by it.
na hi catuḥśṛṅgaṃ tripādaṃ dviśiraskaṃ saptahastaṃ kiñcid yajñasādhanam asti yad anena prakāśyate //	But there is no such animal in this world as is required for the sacrifice in question.
itaś caivam /	Therefore, the mantra conveys no meaning.
acetanapraiṣapradarśanāt [oṣadhe trāyasvainam] iti / na hy oṣadhir budhyate trāṇāya niyuktā 'smīti /	The mantra runs thus :-'Auşadhe trāyasva enam (Oh medicine protect this person.)' But medicine does not understand that it has been employed to protect him.
[śṛṇota grāvāṇaḥ ] iti codāharaṇam /	Another example is this :-'Hear, Oh slabs of stone! (Srnota grāvāṇaḥ).
na hy acetanāḥ grāvāṇaḥ śrotuṃ niyujyante //	This meaning is absurd since unconscious slabs of stone are never employed to listen to something.
api ca[aditir dyaur aditir antarikṣam ] iti vipratiṣiddham abhivadanti mantrāḥ /	Moreover, the mantra 'Aditir dyaurantarîkṣam' (Aditi is the sky, she is the mid region). Similar mantras are full of contradictions.
kathaṃ saiva dyauḥ tad evāntarikṣaṃ bhavitum arhati //	How can Aditi who is the sky be the mid-region? There are some mantras the meaning of which is not at all intelligible.
keṣāñcic ca mantrāṇāṃ artho jñātum eva na śakyate /	If words are not uttered, they cannot convey their meaning.
te katham arthaprakāśanenopakuryuḥ [abhyaksāt indra ṛṣṭiḥ ] iti /	Thus the recital of mantras, being obligatory, renders its assistance to the comple- tion of a sacrifice.
[indraḥ somasya kāṇukāḥ ] iti ca tasmād avivakṣitārthā mantrāḥ //	Therefore it should not be assumed that sole purpose of the recitation of a mantra is to convey its meaning.
api ca uccāraṇam ubhayathā 'pi kartavyaṃ mantrāṇāṃ adṛṣṭāya vā arthapratyāyanāya vā yato 'rtham api nānuccaritāḥ śabdāḥ pratyāyayitum utsahante / tadavaśyakartavye 'sminn uccāraṇe tata eva yajñopakāre siddhe kiṃ arthapratipādanadvāraparigraheṇa prayojanam iti tatrocyate kiṃ mantrebhyo 'rthapratītir eva nāsti kiṃ vā bhavaty api nirnimittā 'sau uta sannimittā 'pi grahaikatvapratītivat avivakṣitā iti //	Establishing the hypothesis that mantras are valid we shall now refute the above hypothesis that mantras have no mean- ing. Do mantras convey no meaning? Or do they convey their meaning without being restrained by any condition? Or, is it your point that their meaning is not intended to be con- veyed like the number 'one' of a sacrificial cup though the communication of their meaning is governed by a set of condi- tions? It is not sound to hold that they (mantras) convey no meaning since when persons who are adept in the meaning of words hear the mantra 'Barhir deva sadanaṁ dāmi (I cutObjection to the Validity of Mantras the kusa-grass, the seat of gods)' they understand its meaning.
na tāvat pratītir eva nāsti śabdārthasambandhavyutpattisaṃskṛtam atītaṃ [barhir devasadanaṃ dāmi ] ity evamādimantraśravaṇe sati tadarthapratīteḥ svasaṃvedyatvāt //	In other words, if they ask their own consciousness, they will find an answer in the affirmative. One cannot hold that the meaning of a mantra is unconditionally grasped. As the constituent words determine the meaning of a sentence consti- tuted by then in classical Sanskrit Language so words deter- mine the meaning of a sentence in Vedic Language.
vyutpattir api na nāsti ya eva laukikāḥ śabdāḥ ta eva vaidikā ta eva teṣām arthā iti lokavyavahāratas tadvyutpattisaṃbhavāt //	It is not a truism that their meaning is not learnt since words which are used in classical Sanskrit Language are also used in Vedic Language. These words denote the same meaning.
nāpi bhavaty api mantrebhyo 'rthapratītiḥ // grahaikatvapratītivad avivakṣitā bhavitum arhati avivakṣānibandhanasya kvacid apy abhāvāt /	Now though mantras may communicate their meaning yet it is not possible to hold that they do not purport to convey their meaning like the number one of a sacrificial cup since there is no reason behind the said non-intention.

All cups uniformly contain such juice. When a mantra says "Pour soma-juice into a cup', it does not purport to convey the singleness of the cup. It purports to convey the case- ending of the cup but not its number since the number has no significance.
iha tu [barhir devasadanaṃ dāmi ] ityevamādivākyakriyamāṇakratūpayogidravyādiprakāśanasya vidhyapekṣitatvāt mantreṇa smṛtaṃ karma karoti /	Let us now turn our attention to the mantra al- ready referred to. The mantra "Barhir deva sadanam dâmi" throws light on such articles as are required for a sacrifice. These articles must get the sanction of an injunction.
tathā kriyamāṇaṃ abhyudayakāri bhavatīti na yajñāṅgaprakāśanam avivakṣitam /	Therefore, one cannot hold that mantras do not purport to reveal articles which are essentially required for a sacrifice.

The injunction 595596 prescribes only muttering. So the knowledge of the meaning of this mantra is not required. When can it be done? But if the injunction 'One should mutter' is conspicuous by its absence then we cannot disregard the meaning of a mantra which is being presented to our consciousness and is being needed for the performance of a rite.

In this connection we point out that we indirectly know from its sense that the mantra 'uru prathasva' is conducive to the expansion of a sacrificial cake. If this be the case then the injunction which reveals its conduciveness should be super- fluous since it says over again what has been known.
tat kiṃ vacanaṃ anarthakam eva nānarthakam pratipannārthaviṣayaṃ tu tat //	Now, the problem is: 'Is the mantra super- fluous? No, it is not superfluous. But it is iterative.
arthavādārthaṃ vā tadvacanam [yajñapatim eva tat prathayati ] iti /	Or, the above mantra is not an injunction. But it is an artha-vāda. In other words, it has a secondary meaning.
yad anena mantreṇa puroḍāśaṃ prathayati tadyajñapatiṃ yajamānam eva prajayā paśubhiḥ prathayatīti //	The act of expan- sion augments the prosperity of the institutor of a sacrifice. It increases his children and animals and thereby augments his prosperity.

This statement does not stand to reasoning.
yathoktaṃ [ anyathākaraṇe cāsya bahubhyaḥ syān nivāraṇam ] iti //	Kumārila has said that if the order of words is changed then objections arise from many points of view.

Have the students of the Vedas the liberty to change the place of words? Our conclusion on this point is this that the order of words in a mantra cannot be changed for the expression of a particular meaning intended by a person like the order of sentences in a Brāhmaṇa work.
yad api [catvāri śṛṅgāḥ ] ity avidyamānārthavacanam aśaṅkitam tad api anabhijñatayā yajñasya vaiṣa guṇavādena sāṃstavaḥ /	Such an apprehension is based upon sheer ignorance. It praises the act of sacrifice. It has a secon- dary meaning. The clause 'Catvãri Sṛngă' points to the four Vedas.

The phrase 'Tridhã baddho' implies that the procedure of a sacrifice is recorded in Mantra, Brahmana and Kalpasūtra. The predicate 'Vṛṣabha' signifies that a sacrifice fulfils all desires. The verb 'roraviti produces an impression that a sacrifice resounds with the chanting of stotras and the recitation of Šāstras. The clause 'Maho devo martyān à viveśa' suggests that the act of sacrifice is the best of all duties and has become current on this earth.
tad yathā cakravākamithunastanī haṃsadantakeśī kāśavasaneti nadī stūyate // [oṣadhe trāyasvainam ] iti cetanavan niyoga tasyāḥ stutyarthaḥ //	The implication of the whole sentence is the praise of a sacrifice as we praise a river when we say that she has her breasts in the shape of a pair of curlews, rows of teeth in the shape of swans, a tuft of hair in the shape of moss and her cloth in the shape of kaša flowers.
[śṛṇota grāvāṇaḥ ] iti prātaranuvākastutiḥ /	The sentence 'Sṛṇota grāvāṇaḥ', is an eulogy of pratar anuvāka.

In spite of them if a person fails to make out the meaning of the Vedas then he does not make a serious attempt at the proper under- standing of such meaning owing to idleness. Therefore, the Vedas should not be taken to task for this failure to under- stand. We may make out the meaning of the Vedas by the same method as we adopt to understand the meaning of the sentences of Brahmaṇas.
upāyaś ca prathamastāvat vṛddhavyavahāra eva tulyatvāl lokavedaśabdārthānām /	The first and foremost method is the usage of the experienced persons since the same words are used in Vedic and classical languages and they convey the same sense.

They do not respectively signify Priyañgu, a black vulture and a black-berry.

They have been used in the hymn, dedicated to the twin gods 'Aśvins'. With reference to the context their etymological meaning is not hard to find out. They signify the sources of preservation and destruction respectively. Thus they are names of Aśvins.

If this suggestion is accepted then there should be other Vedic sentences which will prescribe the very act of sacrifice the end.

So it has a distinct character of its own, (There is a gulf of difference fixed between these two characters.) If we hold that the injunction 'One should perform a parti- cular sacrifice with wine' prescribes only a means then the act of performing a particular sacrifice must have been learnt from another source.

In order to avoid this defect of the said injunction the hypothesis that the above injunction prescribes the act bearing the title ‘Vāja- peya' is resorted to.
yāvad evoktaṃ bhavati [yajeta ] iti tāvad eva [vājapeyena yajeta ] iti /	As soon as it is stated that one should perform a sacrifice, it is learnt that this act bears the title 'Vajapeya'.
evam ānarthakyāt anyatrāpy asamāśvāsaḥ //	so they involve repetition and hence are superfluous).
atrocyate guṇavidhipakṣe yathā bhavān āha tathāiva /	This alternate suggestion appears to us to be better. Let us prove the point in question.
nāmadheyapakṣa eva tu śreyān ity abhyupagamyate /	The term "Vājapeya' is a case in apposition with sacrifice.
tathā hi bhāvārthasya phalaṃ prati karaṇatvāt tatsāmānādhikaraṇyena tṛtīyā prayujyate /	Hence it takes the third case-ending. There are two types of instrumental cases, viz., (1) the pre-existing instrumental case and (2) the instrumental case which will come into being.
tatra [vājapeyena ] iti sādhyaś ca bhavan bhāvārthaḥ karaṇabhāvam anubhavatīti /	When it comes into being it becomes instrumental to the result. Now, the instrumental case itself is an effect.
sādhyatvāpekṣayā tatsāmānādhikaraṇyena kvacit dvitīyā 'pi prayujyate [agnihotraṃ juhoti ] iti //	It is produced. As it is a case in apposition with the meaning of a root so it takes the second case-ending in some cases."Agnihotram juhoti" is an instance of this type.
nanu guṇavan nāmāpi vidhātavyam eva anabhihitsyānavagamāt /	As a means is pres- cribed by an injunction so the designation of a sacrifice should be enjoined since what has not been stated cannot be known.
tataś ca guṇavidhipakṣaspṛśaḥ vākyabhedādidoṣāḥ tadavasthā eva naitad evam na hy asya karmaṇaḥ idaṃ nāma veditavyam iti saṃjñāsaṃjñisambandhaṃ vedo vidadhāti / yogena tu kenacit pravartamānaṃ nāmadheyam avagamyata eva /	If this be the case then the injunction which furnishes us with designation of a sacrifice will be exposed to the same charges as are levelled against a guna vidhi (an injunction prescribing a means). Such a criticism is not sound. The Vedas do never state that this rite should have this designation. But we learn that this name applies to this rite because the name is signi- ficant, admitting of derivation.
udbhedanam anena paśūnāṃ kriyata iti udbhididam //	As this sacrifice helps us to gain animals so it is called Udbhid.
[dadhimadhupayoghṛtaṃ dhātāstaṇṭulā udakaṃ tatsaṃsṛṣṭaṃ prājāpatyam ] iti nānāvidhavicitradravyasādhyatvāt citrā //	Various articles such as sour milk, honey, clarified butter, paddy and water, are instrumental to this sacrifice. As various articles are required for the completion of the Prājāpatya sacri- fice so it is called 'Citra'.
agnaye hotram asminn ity agnihotram //	The rite in which a libation is poured into fire in honour of Fire is called Agnihotra.
[yathā vai śyeno nipatyādatte evam anena dviṣantaṃ bhrātṛvyam ādatte ] ity arthavādāt śyena iva śyeno yāgaḥ /	As a hawk descends with a sweep and catches its prey so this sacrifice assists one to destroy his enemy. Hence from the above praise the sacrifice acquires the title of Syena (a hawk).
tasmāt karmanāmāny etāni //	Thus we arrive at the conclu- sion that the above words are nothing but proper names of sacrifices.
yat tu nāmadheyapakṣe nairarthakyam āśaṅkitaṃ tad api na cāru nāmāpi guṇaphalopalabdheḥ arthavad ity abhiyuktaiḥ parihṛtatvāt /	Some distinguished scholars meet this objection with the remark that though the words 'Vājapeya' etc. are names of sacrifices yet they are significant since they reveal the names and the results of sacrifices.
evaṃnāmedaṃ karmety avagamyate /	This act of sacrifice is designated by this name.
tatra guṇaḥ dravyadevatādiḥ /	From this designation we learn that a substance and a deity are its means.
phalaṃ ca tasya svargaḥ paścād avagamyata iti /	It is also learnt later on that the act is conducive to heaven.
tasmān nāmadheyapadānām aviruddho 'nvayḥ // kvacit punar aprāpte bhāvārthe saguṇam eva tatkarma codyate /	Hence, in some cases, names such as Vājapeya etc. denote sacrifices without violating the rules of the science of Vedic exegeses.
yathā [āgneyo 'ṣṭākapālo 'māvasyāyāṃ ca paurṇamāsyāṃ cā 'cyuto bhavati ] iti /	Let us cite a few examples. The first example is this "Agneyo aṣṭakapālo âmăväsyāyām paurņamāsyâm căcyuto bhavati iti".

We shall not enter into the elaborate discussion of the knotty points of the other branches of study. Our point is this that the truth of the Vedas is not challenged if the Vedas reveal the names of sacrifices.
sarvaprakāreṇāpi siddhaṃ devapramāṇatvam iti //	Therefore, by all means, the validity of the Vedas is established.
vedaprāmāṇyasidhyartham ittham etāḥ kathāḥ kṛtāḥ /	Jayanta says "I have elaborately discussed all these points in order to establish the veracity of the Vedas.
na tu mīmāṃsakacchātapāramithyābhidhānataḥ //	At the same time I implore you all not to take it amiss.

On the strength of the above hypothesis will a large portion of the Vedic lore which points to such objects be set aside and neglected? The task before the logical treatise of the Nyaya school is to establish the truth of the Vedas per se, Some express their opinion in this matter that the truth of the Vedas lies in expressing rites to be performed. The logic be- hind this statement is as follows.
atra kecid āhuḥ sarvasyaiva vedasya kārye 'rthe prāmāṇyam tathā hi gṛhītasambandhaḥ śabdaḥ artham avagamayati /	The meaning of a word is learnt from the employment of words by an experi- enced man. An experienced person uses such sentences as refer to some acts to be performed. He says in the following manner: "Bring water.
sambandhagrahaṇaṃ cāsya vṛddhavyavahārāt /	Fasten this cow with a cord.
vṛddhānāṃ ca vyavahāraḥ [pānīyam ānaya ] [gāṃ badhāna ] [grāmaṃ gaccha ] iti kāryapratipādakair eva śabdaih pravartata iti tatraiva vyutpadyante bālāḥ /	Go to a village". The boys who listen to these statements of the experienced person learn the meaning of the words from these mandatory sentences and their execution. The experienced persons employ such sentences with the definite purpose of relating an end.
prayojanoddeśena hi vṛddhā vākyāni prayuñjate / na ca siddhārthābhinirvartata iti tasya na prayogayogyatvam /	The statements about existing objects do neither persuade nor dissuade persons. Therefore, these senten- ces serve no purpose. Hence, these sentences are not worthy of being used.
aprayuñjyamānasya ca na sambandhagrahaṇam / agṛhītasambandhasya ca na pratipādakatvam / apratipādakasya ca //	The words of which the meanings are not known cannot communicate their meanings. The words which fail to communicate their meanings are not true. Words which remain unrelated to a verb fail to convey any meaning.
na prāmāṇyam //	A verb denotes an act to be performed.
api ca ākhyātapadoccāraṇam antareṇa nirākāṅkṣapratyayānutpādāt avaśyam ākhyātayuktaṃ vākyaṃ prayoktavyam / ākhyātapadena ca sādhyarūpo 'rtha ucyate /	If a word which denotes an existing object and a word which signifies an act to be performed are uttered together then the former is employed to convey the meaning of the latter. Hence, a comp- lete sentence purports to convey an act to be done.
nāmapadena ca siddhaḥ / bhūtabhavyasamuccāraṇe bhūtaṃ bhavyāyopadiśyata iti vākyasya sādhyārthaniṣṭhatete na bhūtārthaviṣaye tasya prāmāṇyam /	There- fore, a sentence is not valid if it conveys only an accomplished fact or a pre-existing substance as its meaning. A sentence is true if it points only to an act to be performed. A sentence which refers to an accomplished fact or a pre- existing object is not true.
siddho arthaḥ prasiddhatvād eva /	As an accomplished object is already known so it is capable of being known by some other valid forms of knowledge.
pramāṇāntaraparicchdayogya iti tatpratipādane tatpramāṇāntarasavyapakṣe śabdo bhavati tataś ca tadgrāhiṇaḥ pramāṇāntarasyaiva tatra prāmāṇyaṃ syāt na śabdasya /	If a sentence reveals such an object then it does not reveal an unknown object as it depends upon another source of knowledge for the knowledge of the object in question. In other words, its information is second-hand but not first-hand.
śabdaś ca tadupasthāpanamātra eva niṣṭhaḥ syāt /	But the sentence which reveals it is not true.
tasmāt śabdaprāmāṇyam icchatā kārya evārthe tatprāmāṇyam aṅgīkartavyam iti //	In this case, the said sentence only .awakens the memory of the object. Those who are inclined to stick to the hypothesis that verbal knowledge is true should admit that the import of a sentence is an act and an act only.
atrocyate yat brūṣe kārya evārthe vākyasya vyutpattir iti tad ayuktam /	The demonstration of the hypothesis that the knowledge of the meaning of a word is possible if it denotes an accomplished fact or a pre-existing object.
evaṃ hi [siddharūpo 'yaṃ tasyārthaḥ ] iti kathaṃ tvayocyate / na hy alabdhavyutpatteḥ śabdāt arthapratyayo yujyate /	But it is not reasonable to subscribe to such a hypothesis. How do you say that this word denotes an accomplished fact? A word does not convey its sense to a person who does not know its meaning.
na ca kāryaparair eva śabdaiḥ loke vyavahāraḥ vartamānopadeśakebhyo 'pi nadyādivākyebhyaḥ vyavahārapravṛtteḥ tatrāpi vyutpattir bhavaty eva //	It is strange to hold that a word conveys its sense but its meaning remains unknown. All our worldly transactions are not conducted only by such words as denote existing objects. People also learn the meaning of such words.
api ca aṅgulyādinā puro 'vasthitam arthaṃ nirdiśya yadā kaścit kathayati [asyedaṃ nāma ] iti tadā kāryopadeśam antareṇāpi bhavaty eva vyutpattiḥ /	A person points his finger to a yonder object and says that this is the name of this object. At that time though no instruc- tion is given to do something yet a person is informed of the meaning of a word. It may be contended that an instruction607 On the meaning of Vedic words is imparted to this effect that one should learn this meaning from this word.
[asmāc chabdād ayam arthaḥ pratipattavyaḥ ] iti kāryopadeśa evāsāv iticet na tādṛśānām akṣarāṇām aśravaṇāt /	Therefore a word refers to an act to be done. Such a contention is not tenable since there is no verbal instruction to this effect that one should learn this meaning from this word.
[asyedaṃ nāma ] iti hi śrūyate na [asmād ayaṃ pratipattavyaḥ ] iti /	It is only heard that this is the name of the object. But nobody hears that this meaning should be learnt.
[asyedaṃ nāma ] ity eṣām evākṣarāṇām eṣo rtha iti cet na apadārthasya kyārthatvāyogāt /	The Mimamsakas have stated that a sentence which implies an effect to be produced is a source of valid knowledge since it reveals such a meaning as it is not grasped by other sources of valid knowledge.
na caivaṃ kalpayitum api śakyate [asyedaṃ nāma ] ity etāvataiva tatpratipattisiddheḥ pratipattikartavyatā 'bhidhānasya niṣprayojanatvāt //	Such a contention is not tenable since there is no verbal instruction to this effect that one should learn this meaning from this word. It is only heard that this is the name of the object.
kāryaparād api śabdāt vyutpattir bhavantī na vākyārthamātraparyavasāyinī bhavati kin tv ekaikapadāvāpāpodvāpadvārakapadārthaparyantā sā bhavati /	When one comes to know the power of the denotation of words which denote only acts to be performed he makes out only the meaning of a sentence consisting of such words.
padārthavyutpattisaṃskṛtamateś ca abhinavakaviviracitavartamānopadeśaślokaśravaṇe 'pi vākyārthapratītir dṛśyata eveti nāvyutpattikṛtam aprāmāṇyam //	If one possesses the deep-rooted impression of the knowledge of the power of denotation of words then he surely understands the meaning of the sentences in a poem which is composed by a modern poet and which relates to existing objects. Therefore, words which denote existing objects are not to be discredited with untruth on the ground that their meaning is not detected. Knowledge which is produced by a word denoting an exis- ting object is neither erroneous nor doubtful.
na cāsau bhūtārthapratipādakaśabdajātinā pratītiḥ bādhyate sandigdhā vā yena pratyakṣādipramāṇāntarakaraṇakapratītivat pramāṇaphalam eva sā bhavitum arhati // yat punar abhidhāyi kārye arthe pramāṇāntaranirapekṣatayā pramāṇaṃ bhavati śabdaḥ bhūtārthe tu neti tadasat śabdasya pramāṃāntarasāpekṣatvānapāyāt /	g., perception etc. produce valid knowledge so a sentence referring to an existing object may generate true knowledge. The Mimāṁsakas have stated that a sentence which implies an effect to be produced is a source of valid knowledge since it reveals such a meaning as it is not grasped by other sources of valid knowledge. They have also stated that if a sentence608 Nyāyamañjari makes an assertion about an existing object then it is not a source of valid knowledge as it depends upon other sources of valid knowledge.
pramāṇāntareṇānavagate hy arthe śabdaḥ pravartayitum eva na śaknoti ity evocāma /	If all sentences purport to convey only an effect to be produced then they cannot induce a person to do something.
vakṣyāmaś ca vākyārthacintāyām api /	We shall also discuss this point in the subsequent section on the meaning of a sentence.
pramāṇāntarasāpekṣatvaṃ tasya pratyuta prāmāṇyam āvahati na pratihanti //	If a sentence makes an assertion about an existing object then it depends upon another source of valid knowledge. But such a depen- dence imparts validity to it.
kiñ cedaṃ sāpekṣatvam iti vaktavyam /	Now, the meaning of the phrase, 'dependence upon another source of valid knowledge' should be clarified.
kiṃ siddhārthābhidhāyinaḥ śabdasya utpattāv eva pramāṇāntarasāpekṣatvam uta tadviṣayasya pramāṇāntaraparicchedayogyatvam ity ubhayathā 'tiprasaṅgaḥ /	Does it mean that the word which denotes an existing object depends upon another source of valid knowledge at the time of its coming into being? Or, does it mean that the object denoted by the word is capable of being grasped by another source of valid knowledge? These two meanings of the phrase are too wide to be accepted.
utpattau pramāṇāntarasavyapekṣatayā yady aprāmāṇyaṃ varṇyate hanta hatam anumānam tasyotpattau pratyakṣādisāpekṣatvāt /	If it is held that a word is not a source of valid knowledge as it depends upon another source of valid knowledge for its appearance then the validity of an inference is undermined since it depends upon perception etc. for its coming into being.
varṇitaṃ ca [tatpūrvakaṃ trividham anumānam ] iti /	It has been stated that the three types of inference are based upon perception.
tadviṣayasya pramāṇāntaragrahaṇāyogyatāyāṃ tu tadaprāmāṇye pratyakṣādīnāṃ sarveṣāṃ aprāmāṇyaṃ prāpnoti pramāṇasaṃplavasya prāk pratipāditatvāt //	If a word which denotes an existing object is invalid because the object is capable of being grasped by other sources of knowledge then all sources of valid knowledge such as percep- tion etc. turn out to be invalid since it has been already proved that a particular object is grasped by many sources of valid knowledge.

By the joint method of agreement and difference he ascertains that they are conducive to his well-being and instrumental to the avoidance of his adversity.

Thus these sentences are only formally but not really injunctive since a verb in the injunctive mood embodies a mandate or a command which independently stirs an inactive person to adopt a course of action.
ye tu bhūtārthavādiṣu laukikavākyeṣu pravṛttinivṛttikāriṣu vidhiniṣedhau kalpayanti te nitarāmṛjavaḥ śrūyamāṇo 'pi vidhiḥ anuvādībhavati yatra tatrāśrutaḥ kalpyata iti kim anyad ataḥ paramārjavam pravṛttau tu tatra vidhir aprayojakaeva anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ puruṣārthasādhanasāmarthyāvagamāt puruṣapratyayād vā lokeṣu pravṛttisiddheḥ //	These so-calledOn the meaning of Vedic words 609 injunctive sentences really imply repetition of something al- ready established. Thus those who hold that a sentence imply- ing an effect to be performed is only a source of valid knowledge must admit that all injunctive sentences used by the people at large should not be a source of valid knowledge. Some thinkers hold that if sentences embodying an asser- tion about the existing objects persuade or dissuade people then they should be taken as good as injunctive or prohibitive ones. But they are really obtruse.
tatraitat syāt laukikavākyānāṃ vivakṣāparatvāt na kāryārthatvam /	It should also be noted in this connection that ordinary sentences purport to convey the intention of a spea- ker but not an act to be performed.
yathoktaṃ [api ca pauruṣeyād vacanāt evam ayaṃ puruṣo vedeti bhavati pratyayaḥ naivam arthateti /	When a person hears a man-made sentence he determines that the speaker knows the content of his sentence thus, other- wise, he should not have said like this.
vaidikāni punaḥ apauruṣeyatayā kāryaparāṇy eva vākyāni ] iti etad api na peśalam apauruṣeyasya vacasaḥ pratikṣiptatvāt /	But the Vedic sentences which have been composed by no author exclusively point to acts to be performed. Such a hypothesis is not sound. The hypothesis that the Vedas have no author has been refuted.
vede 'pi kartur īśvarasya sādhittvāt //	It has been proved on the contrary that God is the author of the Vedas.
na ca puruṣavacanam api vivakṣāparam iti darśitam /	We have also established that a sentence, com. posed by a person, does not imply the intention of the speaker.
tathā hi na vivakṣā vākyārthaḥ [devadatta gām abhyāja kṛṣṇāṃ daṇḍena ] iti padagrāme vivakṣāvādinaḥ padāsyāśravaṇāt apadārthasya vākyārthatvānupapatteḥ /	The intention of an author does not constitute the meaning of his sentence. In the sentence, 'Oh Devadatta! drive away the black cow with a stick' there is no such word as points to the intention of the speaker. It is unreasonable to hold that a sentence implies a sense which is not denoted by a word in it.
na ca viṣabhakṣaṇavākyasyeva paragṛhe bhojananivṛttā pauruṣeyavacasaḥ vivakṣāyāṃ tātparyaśaktir api prabhavati /	The purport of the sentence is to dissuade the son of the speaker from taking meal in another's house. The meaning of this sentence is the intention of the speaker.
na hi sarvātmanā 'bhidhātrīṃ śaktim avadhīryaiva tātparyaśaktiḥ prasarati iti na vivakṣāparatvam //	But such a contention is not tenable. The purport of a sentence does not flash in our mind if it completely disregards the primary meanings of words contained in it.
kathaṃ tarhi puruṣavacanād uccāritāt vivakṣāvagama iti cet anumānād iti brūmaḥ /	How does a listener understand the intention of a speaker from his sentence? Our answer is that his intention is inferred from the sentence uttered by him.
kāryatvāt padaracanāyāḥ puruṣecchāpūrvakatvam anumīyate /	This arrange- ment is not possible if a person does not will to do it.
arthāvagamapuraśaraṃ ca puruṣavacanāt vivakṣānumānaṃ [evam ayaṃ veda ] [evam ayaṃ vivakṣati ] iti / arthoparāgarahitasya vivakṣāmātrasya jīvatāṃ nisargata eva siddheḥ /	When- ever one notices an arrangement of words he infers that it has been conditioned by the will of a person. When he knows the meaning of a sentence he infers to this effect 'as the speaker knows so he intends to communicate his knowledge.' A mere colourless intention which has no reference to the meaning of a sentence cannot be inferred since such an inten- tion is the natural gift of all living beings.
[ayam artho 'sya vivakṣitaḥ ] ity arthoparajyamānā tu vivakṣā na śakyā arthe 'navagate 'vagantum /	We cannot say that this meaning has been intended unless and until the intention takes a concrete shape, being focussed upon the meaning of a sentence.
arthaś cet prathamam avagato vākyāt na tarhi tat vivakṣāparam arthaparam eva bhavitum arhati /	If the primary meaning of a sentence is not learnt at the outset then the sentence can- not convey the intention of its speaker as its sense.
lokavākyānāṃ vivakṣāparatve bāhye 'rthe sambandhagrahaṇāsaṃbhavāt vedād api vākyārthāvagamo na syād ity alaṃ prasaṅgena //	If it is held that the ordinary sentences signify intention but not external objects then none can know the relation of denotation holding between a word and an external object.
tasmān na kāryaparatvenaiva śabdasya prāmāṇyam //	In that case none should make out the meaning of a sentence.
yat punar abhāṇi nākhyātaśūnyaṃ vākyaṃ prayogārham / tena vinā nairākāṅkṣyānupapatteḥ /	It has also been stated that there should be no such sentence 610On the meaning of Vedic Words as does not involve a reference to a process since if a process is set aside then a sentence cannot retain its self-completeness.
ākhyātasya ca bhavyarūpaḥ arthaḥ na nāmna iva bhūtaḥ /	The inflexion attached to a verb denotes a process (an act to be performed). Like a noun it does not signify an existent object.
bhūtabhavyasamuccāraṇe ca bhūtaṃ bhavyāyopadiśyata iti sarvatra kāryaparatvam iti tad api na saṃpratam [putras te jātaḥ ] [kanyā te garbhiṇī ] iti sukhaduḥkhakāriṇāṃ anupadiṣṭapravṛttinivṛttikānāṃ anākhyātānām api vākyānāṃ loke prācuryeṇa prayujyamānatvāt //	The words contained in these sentences have no syntactical relation to a process, words which denote pre-existent objects are employed with a view to expressing a process, i.e., something to be effec- tuated. This hypothesis is not tenable. The sentences viz. 'You are blessed with a new born son', 'Your virgin daughter is big with a child' etc. make us happy and sad.
atha [sukhī bhava ] [duḥkhī bhava ] iti tatra kāryaparatvaṃ vyākhyāyate tad api na yuktam īdṛśānām akṣarāṇām aśravaṇāt kalpanāyāś ca niṣphalatvāt /	Now the opponents may contend that the above two sentences imply 'Be happy' and 'Be sad'. Thus they purport to do some- thing. Such an interpretation is not tenable since no such words which denote an act to be performed (a process) are heard in these sentences.
na hi [sukhī bhava ] ity upadeśāt asau sukhī bhavati sukhībhavituṃ vā kvacit pravartate /	None is happy if he is advised to be happy. No body prepares his mind to be happy in response to such an advice.
upeye ca pravṛttyanupapatteḥ /	One moves for the means which is conducive to pleasure but none sets up for the result itself.
kin tu putrajanmaśravaṇata evāsau sukhībhavati //	A person feels happy as soon as he hears that a son has been born to him.

A person enjoys sleep with his body covered with an upper garment. During his slumberhis body is bound by a piece of rope to make a fun of him. When he wakes up he suddenly imagines that he was wrapped by the coil of a snake and does not properly open his eyes out of fear. In this plight if the sentence 'You have been tied by a piece of rope' reaches his ears then in spite of its 611612 denoting an accomplished fact it becomes a source of true knowledge.
na ca tatra [mā bhauṣī ] iti prayogakalpanāyāḥ prayojanam rajjuveṣṭanapratyayād eva bhayanivṛtteḥ siddhtvāt //	In this case it is superfluous to imagine that the above sentence purports to convey 'Don't cherish fear', i.e., something to be done since as soon as he believes in the statement that he has been bound by a piece of rope his fear disappears. Therefore the above advice is fruitless.
tathā ca [viṣamaviṣadharādhiṣṭhito 'yam adhvā ] [nidhiyukto 'yaṃ bhūbhāgaḥ ] iti bhūtārthakhyāpakaṃ vaco dṛśyate na ca tadapramāṇam /	The sentences, viz., 'There is a terrible poisonous snake on the road', 'There is a precious gem on this spot' etc., point to pre-existent objects.

It is not reasonable to make out prohibition and injunction as their meaning. They do not respectively suggest 'Do not go by this path' and 'Go by this way and come by a gem' since words denoting persuasion and dissuasion are not heard in them. The Mīnāmsakas may contend thus -As the speaker makes a statement after mature deliberation so he makes no super- fluous statement.
kathañcid ālasyādinā noccaritānīti naitad yuktam prekṣāpūrvakāritvād eva vaktuḥ yathā 'vasthitavastusvarūpamātrakhyāpakavacanoccāraṇam eva yuktam arthāt pravṛttinivṛttyoḥ siddhatvāt parābhiprāyasya cānavasthitatvena niyatopadeśānupapatteḥ /	For this reason the advisory words such as 'Do not go', 'Go by this path', etc., have flashed in his mind but owing to some reasons such as indolence etc., he has not uttered them. Such a contention is not tenable. As the speaker is an intelligent person so he should make only a statement of facts. The listener realising the meaning of the sentence either moves toward the object or turns away from it.
sarvabandhajīvino hi sapannaga eva panthā upādeyatayā 'vabhāti /	All listeners have no common purpose to serve. Therefore one and the same advice should not be given to all.

With regard to the second it does not apply to him since as he, having realised the Absolute, has neither attachment for worldly objects nor hankering after wealth so the gem in question is considered by him as a rejectable object. Which advice will be given to whom? In other words, no advice has universal application. But if a statement of facts is made then love and hatred may act as the spring of action of a listener and he may proceed towards an object or turn away from it.

This hypothesis is not tenable. A person who knows the relation of denotation obtaining between a word and the object denoted by it makes out the meaning of the same when- ever he hears it.
nanu kāryārthapratipādakaṃ padam antareṇa padāntarāṇi saṃsargam eva na bhajante kāryākāṅkṣānibandhanatvāt sambandhasya /	If a person does not make out the meaning of a sentence then does he realise that it is his duty to do it? The Mimamsakas further contend that if in a sentence there is no such word as denotes an act to be brought into being then remaining words are not mutually connected since if the word denoting an act to be generated requires them (those words) then they are mutually connected, otherwise, they are not connected.

It is seen that in sentences which are statements of facts words mutually connect themselves and communicate a connected meaning.
na hi daśadāḍimādivākyasaṃd•śi vartamānāpadeśīni vacāṃsi bhavanti / kāryanibandhane hi sambandhe tadrahitānām anvaya eva syāt /	613 Words in sentences which are statements of facts do not lack mutual connection like those in the famous sentence 'Ten pomegranates etc.' If a word denoting an act to be brought into being were the pivot of mutual connection among all other words in a sentence then a sentence which is the state- ment of a fact and which contains no such word as denotes an act to be brought into being would not have communicated a connected meaning.
darśitaś cānvayaḥ pūrvodāhṛtavākyānām //	It has been shown that all the sentences referred to before by way of illustrations convey well-connected meanings.

sa kathaṃ samarthayiṣyate /	How will the Mimamsakas explain this? If the mutual connection of words denoting facts is determined by the requirement of a word denoting something to be brought into being then the mutual connection of them (those words denoting facts) cannot take place.

In case of such a defence we regret to point out that they should admit that the mutual connection of words takes place because the word denoting an act to be preformed requires it (such connection). If they admit the act above suggestion then as in the sentence 'One should purchase Soma plant in exchange of a red brown-eyed and one-year-old heifer' the third case-ending is attached to the stems denoting substances and qualities and thereby they are considered to be fit for purchase so they are at first detected to be connected with the act of purchasing and afterwards the mutual connection subsisting between the substance and its qualities is grasped.

The rule that when a word denoting an existing object and that denoting an act to be performed are used together in a sentence the first object expresses itself as subordinate to the second one is not universally true.

Let us explain the drift of the above argu- ment. A sacrificial cake is the proximate condition of a sacri- fice. Rice is the stuff of which a cake is made up.
na hy atra karma kiñcit sādhyam pradhānam upadiśyate adhikārāśravaṇāt /	But the act in question is subordinate to paddy. Therefore the above rule does not hold good.

But no such result can be imagined in this way as there is no definite instruction. The knowledge of the soul does not prompt us to any action.

If one realises the perfect soul then he does not suffer from the sorrow of hankering after other objects since the soul itself is the highest goal of life.
sa ca siddha eva na sādhyaḥ /	The soul is an existing substance but not an effect to be brought into being.
yatnas tu kṛtabuddhīnāṃ avidyoparamāyaiveti vyācakṣate //	After the realisation of the soul the men of settled conviction should exert themselves to dispel the basic ignorance about the soul.
[jñātavyaḥ ] iti pratipattikartavyatāparo 'yaṃ vidhir iti cet na pratipatteḥ pramititvāt /	The Mimamsakas may contend that the sentence The soul should be known' is injunctive since it enjoins one to acquire the knowledge of the soul.
pramiteś ca prameyaniṣṭhatvāt /	The true knowledge of an object is determined only by the object.
[jñātavyaḥ ] iti ca karmaṇi krtyapratyayanirdeśāt /	Thus the objective case in question is such as implies the preferential connection with the verb 'to know'.

vidhis tatra prasarann api kva prasaret phalaṃ tāvat vidheḥ na viṣaya eva / yathā ''ha bhaṭṭaḥ [phalāṃśe bhāvanāyāś ca pratyayo na vidhāyakah ] iti /	An injunction cannot exert its influence upon the soul since a result cannot be enjoined. Kumārila has also lent his support to the above view that a suffix which denotes an injunction enjoins to do an action but not to realise a result.

The Absolute, being uncaused, is not subject to destruction. It transcends beginningless Nescience. As it enjoys immutable existence so it is the summum bonum of human life. Our inte- rest shifts from some objects to someother objects when we realise the unsubstantial character of the former ones.

How can perception reveal a universal? Unless all locii of the so-called universal are compared and known to be similar a universal which belongs to all particu- lars as their common property cannot be known. Hence the knowledge of a universal has a dependant character. Perception immediately results from the sense-object-contact. It involves no reference to the past and the future times.

But a universal and a particular are not different since they are not differently perceived.

A univer- sal is not different from a particular since a universal is not cognised if a particular is not perceived. If an object is different from another object then the cognition of one does not pre- suppose that of another.
yaddhi yato vyatiriktaṃ tata tasminn agṛhyamāṇe 'pi gṛhyate ghatād iva paṭaḥ /	Let us take an illustration. A jar is different from a piece of cloth. The former is cognised indepen- dently of the latter.

tatraivāsya samāptatvāt na syāt piṇḍāntare grahaḥ // ekadeśena vṛttau tu gotvajātir na kutracit /	There is no chance of cognising it at another locus. Again, if a universal rests upon a particular partially then a universal does not wholly rest on a particular.
samagrā 'stīti gobuddhiḥ pratipiṇḍaṃ kathaṃ bhavet //	In that case, how can we recognise a particular cow as a cow? Moreover, a universal is a part- less whole.
jāteś ca niravayavatvāt na kecid ekaśāḥ santi yair eṣā pratipiṇḍaṃ varteta /	As such it consists of no parts. Hence, the different particulars cannot share it part by part.

The Buddhist fail to follow the hypothesis of the Vaiseşikas that a universal inleres in all the particulars of a class.
[ayutasiddhānām ādhāryādhārabhūtānāṃ yaḥ sambandha ihapratyayahetuḥ sa samavāyaḥ] iti yad ucyate tad vipratiṣiddham /	The Vaiseşikas define the relation of inherence thus:- It is such a relation as subsists between the container and the contained which are inseparably connected and is a source of the judgment that one rests on another.
ayutasiddhatā ca sambandhaś ceti kathaṃ saṅgaccheta pṛthaksiddhe hi vastunī kuṇḍabadaravat anyonyaṃ sambandhyete strīpuṃsavad vā /	Now if two objects are inseparable from each other then how does the relation of inherence subsist between them? If an object keeps itself apart from another object then a relation takes place between such a pair of objects, e. g., a plum fruit and a reservoir of water or a male and a female.
ayutasiddhatve tu tadekatvāt kiṃ sambadhyeta ṇa hy ahaṃ mayaiva sambadhye //	As there is no difference between them so how can they be related to each other? In other words, a relation pre-supposes two terms but one-term-relation is an absurdity.

There is no sense in this contention since an object having an attribute cannot be distinguished from an attribute An object having attributes cannot demonstrate its separate entity from attributes such as colour etc. But it is strange that the Vaiseşikas wish to draw a distinction between a substance and its attributes.

Threads are distinct from pot-sherds. Therefore, a piece of cloth is distinct from a jar. But a jar always depends upon pot-sherds.

Hence the word "'yuta-siddha' admits of the two shades of meaning. Again, the Vaišeşikas hold that the all-pervasive substances, e. g., the sky etc. have no mutual contact.

2.08a.07 avayavāvayavinor api samavāyātmā sambandha evam eva parihartavyaḥ /	Thus, the relation of inherence holding between parts and a whole should be discarded.

If the indepen- dent existence of the substratum of a universal at the initial stage is admitted then the assumption of a yuta-siddhi becomes illogical. The Vaišeşikas admit that an atom comes into con- tact with the two ubiquitous substances such as the Sky and Time.
2.08a.12 tasmān na jātivyaktyoḥ kācit vṛttir upapadyate //	Therefore, it is not reasonable to hold that a distinct relation subsists between a universal and its sub- stratum.

If itObjections against the accepance of a universal 623 conveys an attribute such as whiteness etc. then a universa! should belong neither to the colourless air and to the internal organ nor to an attribute and to an action. If it means the form of an object then a universal should not belong to the formless objects such as an attribute etc.

Or, is it a property of a sub- stance? Or, is it a distinct substance? We have alrealy pointed out that it is not a distinct substance. It is not property of a substance since the property of a substance is not presented to us as distinct from the substance itself.

Or, does it wholly belong to all particulars only? It is omni- present then a white horse should be presented to us as a horse. An elephant should be grasped by us as a camel and so on.

For this reason we arrive at the conclusion that the universal of cowness cannot be all-pervasive.
2.08c.11 piṇḍasarvagatatve tu kāmam etad adūṣaṇam /	But if it is held that a universal belongs to the body then we admit that the above criticisms do not apply to this hypothesis.

The reason of this non-recognition is as follows. When the calf was in the womb of a cow it did not possess a body at the earlier stage of embryonic life.
2.08c.14 saṃkrāmati na cānyasmāt piṇḍād anyatra niṣkriyā //	A universal cannot be transferred from its place of residence to some other place since it remains.
2.08c.15 āyāty api na taṃ piṇḍaṃ apojjhati purātanam /	Even, if it is admitted that a universal comes from some other place then how is it that it does not desert its old place of residence! When it comes over to a new place it does not come piece meal.

One cannot suggest that one of these two ideas is erroneous as it is constructed by our imagi- nation. The ideas of generality and particularity (uniqueness), produced by an object, are never contradicted.
2.08d.14 tad etad abhidhīyamānam eva na manojñam ivābhāti /	So these ideas are not erroneous. Those who hold that they are not true commit a mistake.

tad eva sāmānyaṃ sa eva viśeṣaḥ tad evaikaṃ tad eva nānā tad eva nityaṃ tad evānityaṃ tad evāsti tad eva nāsti iti jainocchiṣṭam idam ucyate /	Kumärila's hypothesis amounts to this: What is universal is particular; What is one is many; what is eternal is non- eternal; and what is is not. He says something which nobody has experienced. He may say so.

Because one cannot employ a word if he does not know the relation holding between a word and the object denoted by it and one cannot infer if he does not know the relation of universal concomitance obtaining between the probans and the probandum.
dvayapratītimātreṇa dvayā 'bhyupagamo bhramaḥ // na neti pratyayād eva mithyātvaṃ kevalaṃ dhiyām / kin tu yuktiparīkṣāpi kartavyā sūkṣmadarśibhiḥ //	only an individual object then it is not possible to know the relation of denotation subsisting between a word and its mean- ing. Again if the relation of universal concomitance holds bet- ween a particular probans and a particular probandum then we cannot draw a conclusion since deduction presupposes genera- lisation.

Do you know all the relations of universal concomitance which hold between all individual pairs of probans and probandum. We cannot know all such relations since individual objects which belong to different times and spaces are infinite in num- bers.
ata eva na te samyagadhyakṣajajñānavedinaḥ /	Hence all objects of the world are beyond' the range of our experience.
abhedavṛtti pratyakṣaṃ āhut advaitavāñchayā // tasmāt bhedāviṣayatvāt pratyakṣasya na tadgamyaṃ sāmānyam //	We cannot select a representative individual and discovering the relation of denotation or that of universal concomitance can serve our purpose. If we do so, we are liable to commit a fallacy.
nanu evam apahnūyamāne sāmānye gaugaur iti śābaleyādiṣu yo 'yam anuvṛttaḥ pratyayaḥ sa kathaṃ samarthayiṣyate uktam atra vikalpamātram eṣa pratyayaḥ /	Suppose we know that this word denotes this particular object and this probans is universally connected with this probandum. When this word is heard some other particular object may be signified by it. Similarly, when the probans in question is seen some other probandum may be inferred.
vikalpāś ca nārthādhīnajanmāna iti /	So we are liable to commit a fallacy.
tathā ca paraparikalpiteṣu sattādisāmānyeṣv api sāmānyam ity anuvṛttavikalpāḥ pravartanta eva /	But we also learn that the word in question also con- veys another individual meaning. In case of inference, a probans sometimes points to some other individual probandum.

The sum and substance of the argument ofPossibility of Concepts even on denial of Universals the Naiyāyikas is that the hypothesis of a universal is necessary for the possibility of verbal and inferential knowledge.
kaḥ punar asāv upādhir iti cet ekārthakriyākāritvam iti brūmaḥ // yad eva vāhadohādi kāryam ekena janyate /	The Buddhists meet the above objection thus: The objection, raised by the Naiyāyikas, would have been pointed if the pro- bans and a word had been related to an exclusively particular real.
gopiṇḍena tad evānyaiḥ iti teṣv anuvṛttadhīḥ //	629 The Naiyāyikas raise a deeper objection against the above superficial solution.
nanu prativyakti kāryaṃ bhinnam eva satyam bhedabubhyabhāvāc ca tad ekam ity upacaryate //	In order to follow the import of a statement one should be conversant with the convention that the constituent words denote these meanings.

na tv abhinnam eva khaṇḍamṇḍayoḥ kāryaṃ / bāḍham / darśanam eva tarhi tayor ekaṃ bhaviṣyati tac cābhinnam //	The meaning of each term should be grasped. But its meaning is an inference. Again, this inferential knowledge presupposes verbal knowledge.

More- over verbal knowledge presupposes inferential knowledge as its condition and inferential knowledge presupposes verbal know- ledge as its condition.

Why do not you follow our stand-point? We have repeatedly tried to impress our point of view upon your mind. Verbal and inferential knowledge refer to imaginary objects. As concepts do not point to real objects so the above objections do not affect our position.

The Buddhists say in reply to this objection that concepts surely refer to a common element but this common element is not objectively real.
kaḥ punat asāv iti cet ucyate atadrūpaparāvṛttisvabhāvam avahirgatam /	What is this unreal common element? It is an exclusion of the other of itself. Non-non-A is the common element of A.

ata eva hi śabdārthaṃ anyāpohaṃ pracakṣate //	For this reason the Buddhists hold that a word denotes the exclusion of the other of the object denoted by it.
tathā hi na vikalpā vastu spṛśanti /	This hypothesis amounts to this that concepts do never refer to real objects.

In order to cancel the attributed character the judgment that this is not a non-cow is necessary. But no judgment like this can grasp the real nature of a cow since she has been previously cognised. Now the objectors may contend that an object is characterised by various charac- teristic features.

If a characteristic is not grasped then it will remain undetected for ever since it is impotent to characterise its substantive. The characterization brought about by the characteristic features is not different from the thing itself which is characterized.
tadabhede sati tadviśeṣaṇopakāryavastusvarūpagrahaṇavelāyām eva tatkhacitagrahaṇasiddheḥ vikalpāntarāṇām ānarthakyam eva /	63 I A thing-in-itself has many characteristic features which are adjectival in their character.

The sum and substance of Kumärila's critical remarks may be put thus : The word 'apoha' denotes an exclusion. An exclusion is negation.
na cābhāvaḥ svatantratayā ghaṭavad avagamyate /	No negative object is independently grasped like a jar.
tad ayam anyāśrito vaktavyaḥ / kaś ca tasyāsraya iti cintyam //	So it should have been mentioned as a dependent object. Now, it should be found out what is the locus of the said exclu-632 Nyāyamanjari sion, i.e., negation.

Subspecies like Sabaleyatva, etc., cannot be the locus of the exclusion of the other of a cow since it is only excluded by the exclusion of the other of Sabaleyas only.
na ca śābaleyasāmānyam agonivṛtter āśrayaḥ tad dhi aśābaleyanivṛtter āśrayatāṃ pratipadyate /	In other words, we fail to draw a distinction between a cow and non-non-Śäbaleya since Sabaleya is only not non-Śābaleya.
na hy evam upapadyate aśābaleyo na bhavatīti gauḥ kin tu śābaleyo 'śābaleya iti /	Or, if the Buddhists hold that the exclusion of non-cows belongs to all individual cows then this thesis does not stand to reasons since if all cows are not comprehended then the exclusion of non-cow is not at all grasped.
aśābaleyavyāvṛttir hi gośv api bāhuleyādiṣv asti //	All individual cows are countless as they occupy diffe- rent spaces and times.
atha śābaleyādisvalakṣaṇasmudāyaṃ agovyāvṛtter āśrayaṃ brūyuḥ so 'py aghaṭamāna eva samudayivyatirekeṇa tasyānupalaṃbhāt /	Hence the exclusion of non-cow cannot exist as a logical entity apart from all individual cows. Therefore we should think of a new exclu- sion of non-cow which is a common property of all individual cows and which wholly resides in each individual cow.
samudāyināṃ ca svalakṣaṇānāṃ deśakālādibhedenānantyāt vargīkaraṇaṃ puruṣāyuṣaśatenāpi na śakyakriyam iti samudāyo 'pi na tadāśrayaḥ /	You should note the point of criticism that such an exclusion cannot be admitted because there is no possibility of knowing all individual cows simulta- ncously. According to the Buddhists the words such as ‘a horse', etc. do not signify a positive object.
tasmāt sarvasādhāraṇaṃ pratipiṇḍaṃ parisamāptaṃ kim api nūtanaṃ agovyāvṛtter adhikaraṇaṃ abhidhātavyam /	The same criticism holds good in every case and sets at naught their hypothesis. There- fore in no case a concept can point to a negative general image.

Thus, all the worldly transactions should come to a stop. Moreover, all words such as SŚäbaleya, etc., denote negative meanings. They cannot be distinguished from each other.

Now, the Buddhists may counter-charge the Naiyāyikas with the following remarks that all words denoting universals should also be taken as synonyms as all universals stand for generality. Such a counter-charge does not make an appeal to reasons since these universals are positive objects and are accepted to be many, being mutually different.
kiṃ ca ya ete śābaleyādiśabdāḥ te sarva evāpohavācitvāviśeṣāt paryāyāḥ syuḥ /	Now, the Buddhists may adopt a new line of defence and hold that, these apohas will be mutually different since the locii such as a white horse and Śābaleya, etc.
apohyabhedād adoṣa iti cet na apohānāṃ bhedābhāvāt /	Such a defence is not tenable since it has been shown that the said locii cannot contain apohas.
bhidyamānatve vā svalakṣaṇavad eṣāṃ vastutvaprasaktiḥ //	Such a defence is not sound since such a distinction is indirect, being based upon negative function.

Moreover, some objects which are marked by otherness are very remote and lie beyond the reach of our knowledge. In that case how is the exclusion of such others at all possible? If the 'other' has not a distinct character then the exclusion of the other becomes incompre- hensible.
karkādiśābaleyādyādhārabhedād apohabheda iti cet na teṣām ādhāratvasya nirastatvāt /	The exclusion of non-cow lacks a distinct character since the term 'non-cows' denotes everything excepting cow.
ādhārabhedena vā tadbhedābhyupagame pratisvalakṣaṇaṃ apohabhedaprasaṅgaḥ /	An exclusion of non-cow is also indefinite in its character since it is impossible to comprehend the fult extent of non-cow.
tataś ca sāmānyātmatā 'sya hīyate //	And the meaning of term (horse) is to be fixed up by the exclusion of non-horse (other than a horse).
atha apohyabhedam avadhārya paryāyatā parāṇudyate tad apy asāram tadāpy apohyabhedād bhedo na paryāyatvam apahanti /	and above the common objects which are excluded by the term "horse'. Similarly, the term 'horse' excludes only cows besides the common objects which are excluded by the term 'cow'.

If they hold that the term 'cow' denotes only an exclusion of non- cow but does not make mention of a horse as the distinct ob- ject to be excluded then they make a wrong statement since each and every item which falls within the denotation of non- cow is incomprehensible, the range of denotation being in- finitely large.

Now, the Buddhists may contend that the apoha 'non-non- cow' denotes all cows without an exception.
athāsādhāraṇyāt aśvāpoha eva go 'poha iṣyate sa tarhi siṃhādāv apy astīti so 'pīdānīṃ gaur bhavet //	If the mea- ning of the term 'non-non-cow' is understood then that of the term 'cow' is grasped and, again, if the meaning of the term 'cow' is intelligible then that of the term 'non-non-cow' is comprehensible.
athāśvādiviśeṣoddhoṣarahitam agorūpaṃ vyavacchedyam ucyate tat pratyekaṃ grahītum aśakyaṃ ānantyāt /	In fine, the critics hold that as an apoha is incomprehensible so it is impossible to distinguish one apoha from another by means of a reference to difference in the ob- jects negated by them.
vargīkaraṇakāraṇaṃ ca kiñcin nāstyeva /	Moreover, no particular is denoted by a term.
atha gopratiṣedha eva vargīkaraṇaherur iṣyate hanta tarhi gauḥ pūrvasiddha eṣitavyaḥ yatpratiṣedhenāgāvaḥ pratīyeran /	Now, if the Buddhists hold that the object to be negated bears a general character then though it is nega- tive in its character yet it must be admitted to be generic at the same time.
pūrvasiddhe va gavi labdhe kim agobhiḥ kiṃ vā tadapohena prayojanam pūrvasiddhaṃ gosvalakṣaṇam astyeveti cet na tena vyavahārābhāvāt /	Why do you hold that an apoha is the negation of a negation? Are you not aware of the import of the phrase 'the negation of a negation'. When one negation cancels ano- ther negation the resultant of this counter-negating process is a positive object.
gosāmānye tu pūrvasiddhe mudhā 'pohaprayatna ity uktam //	It is a positive object. Now, another question flashes in our mind.
atha gosāmānyam agopratiṣedhena siddhyati tadā dustaram itaretarāśrayam ahoniṣedhena gosiddhiḥ gosiddhyā cāgoniṣedhasiddhir iti /	It is this: Does the exclusion itself of the objects to be excluded such as a horse, etc., differ from them? Or, does it become identical with them? If the Buddhists hold that the said exclusion has a specific character by means of which it distinguishes itself from the objects negated then it will be accepted as a positive ob- ject.
tasmād apohyasyaiva nirūpayitum aśakyatvāt na tadbhedād apohabhedaḥ siddhyati //	One cannot characterize a negation. Hence, no verbal transaction is possible with it.

Refutation of Apoka-a general negative image Buddhists say that an apoha is possessed of a specific character, i.e., a mark of distinction then it is surely a positive object since a positive object is only predicated and communicated to others by means of a proposition.
karaṇe vā pratiṣedhadvayayogāt vidhir avatiṣṭhata iti vidhirūpaḥ śabdārthaḥ syāt //	If the Buddhists hold that an apoha and the object negated by it are one and the same thing then the term 'cow' and 'non-non-cow' should be synonymous since both these two terms denote negation.
availakṣaṇye tu yādṛśa evāpohyaḥ tādṛśa eva tadapoha iti gaur apy agauḥ syāt // kiṃ ca apohaśabdārthapakṣe nīlam utpalam ityādau viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāvasāmānādhikaraṇyādivyavahārā vilupyeran /	Moreover, if a term denotes merely an exclusion (apoha) then the proposition that this lotus is blue will lose all its significance since the relation of identity holds between the subject and the predicate and the relation of identity cannot be maintained in this case. A nega- tion cannot predicate another negation.
na hi ekasminn arthe dvayor apohayor vṛttir upapadyate /	Two distinct negative terms cannot point to the same object.

sadjñeyādiśabdānāṃ apohyanirūpaṇāsaṃbhavāt nāpohavācitvam /	637 As the negative meaning of the words 'existent' and 'know- able' is impossible to find out so they do not denote 'apohas'.
na hy asad ajñeyaṃ vā kiñcid avagatam yat vyavacchidyeta /	Nobody is aware of an unreal object as other than an existent object and of an unknowable object as other than a knowable object.
jñātaṃ cet sad eṣa tat jñeyaṃ ceti /	If the objects to be excluded are necessarily presented to our consciousness then they must be taken as existent and knowable.
ataḥ kathaṃ sacchebdena sad eva jñeyaśabdena ca jñeyam evāpohyate /	Thus the term 'existent' and 'knowable' can exclude neither non-existent and unknowable objects nor existent and knowable objects.
ajñātaṃ tu na nitarām apohyam /	What is beyond the reach of our consciousness. cannot be negated.
kalpitaṃ tu tat vaktum aśakyam kalpanayaiva sattvāt jñeyatvāc ca //	Therefore, the Buddhists cannot hold that the object to be excluded has an imaginary being since if the object to be excluded is a construction of our imagination then the object to be excluded ceases to be unreal and unknowable but becomes knowable.
apohaśabdasya kiṃ vācyam iti cintyam /	We should also examine the meaning of the word 'apoha'.
anapoho na bhavatīty apohaḥ /	It will certainly mean the exclusion of non-apoha.

The Mimāṁsakas ask 'How do they explain words other than -common apohas' then how will the Buddhist reconcile revised thesis with their initial proposition that all words denote apohas. Why do the Buddhists cherish so much hatred against the view that common nouns denote universals which are not conceptual? Words other than common nouns are either meaningless or de- notative of concepts.

The Buddhists hold that a sentence signifies mere conceptual knowledge, i.e., agreement or difference between coucepts. They flatly deny that a sentence points to the meanings of words mutually related. Very well, let words denote concepts. Why do they insist upon propounding the thesis that words denote apohas? (In this connection we shall refer to some other points which have not been explicitly mentioned by Jayanta.
padārthe 'pi tathaivāstu kim apohāgraheṇa vaḥ //	If the negative particle 'not' denotes an apoha then these two meanings cannot be made out.
ityādidūṣaṇaudāryaṃ apohe bahudarśitam /	Its meaning is also distinct from that of inflexions. A nipata may admit of many meanings.

apoho yadi bhāvātmā bahir abhyupagamyate / tato bhavati bhāvatkaṃ vāgjālaṃ na tv asau tathā //	If an apoha is a positive object and belongs to the external world then the cobwebs of your arguments rightly entangle the Buddhists. But an apoha is not so as the Mimāṁsakas think of it.
kin tu khalv ayam āntaro jñānātmā saugatānām apohaḥ sammataḥ // tathā 'bhyupagame ceyam apohavācoyuktiḥ svāṃśaviśayaṃ padārthajñānānām ity etāvad eva vaktum ucitam //	But, according to the Buddhists, an apoha is an inner object since it is a form of consciousness. Now, if it is an inner object then what will be the fate of your arguments, demonstrated by proposition? In other words, your arguments will be pointless. Does it mean that an apoha is that awareness of an object which includes the object in itself ? Such a statement is not exact.
etad api nāsti nāyam āntaraḥ na bāhyo 'pohaḥ / kin tu jñānārthābhyāmanya eva // nanu yad vidyate nāntaḥ na bahiḥ paramārthataḥ /	An apoha is neither inner nor outer but it is distinctly other than both consciousness and its object. Now, the Mimāṁsakas raise a question and ask, "If someth- ing is neither an internal nor an external object then it should be unreal.
tan na vidyate eveti kathaṃ śabdārtha ucyate // pāramārthikaśabdārthasamarthanapipāsitāḥ /	How do the Buddhists hold that the meaning of a word is such an unreal object, viz., an apoha ?” A reply to the above question is as follows.
nehāgatāḥ smo yenaiva anuyujyemahi tvayā // yata eva tan nāntar bahir asti tata eva mithyeti kālpanikam iti ca gīyate / kiṃ punas tat āropitaṃ kiñcid ākāramātraṃ vikalpoparaṃjakam // nanu bāhyārthavyatirekeṇa kim īya ākāraḥ āntarasya jñānasyoparaṃjaka ucyate dṛśyacchāyaivānuraṃjikā vikalpānāṃ na dṛśyo 'rthaḥ /	Now, you may ask, "What is its exact chara- cter ?" Our reply is this that it is referred to by a judgment which is a construction of our imagination and that it is merely a vague form which is attributed to knowledge. The Mîmām- sakas ask-if an external object does not stand in front of a perceiver then the form of which object is referred to by a judgment as its predicate? We beg to point out in reply to the above question that the suggestion of the Mimamsakas does not- 640 hold good that the form of a sensible object is only referred to by a judgment as its predicate.
vyāvṛttaṃ hi vastu darśanānāṃ viṣayaḥ /	An object which is exclusively particular is sensed by us.
tac ca spraṣṭum akṣamā vikalpā ity uktam //	We have stated before that an object as excluded from all objects is referred to only by a judgment of perception.

Thus they draw the conclusion from the above premises that judgments of perception refer to points of reality as they refer to an exclu- sion. They remark that judgment of perception should enjoy the same status as an indeterminate perception, i.e., pure sense- perception. The Buddhists give a reply to this objection.
na ca pāramārthikī vyāvṛttiḥ api tu kaścid āropita ākāraḥ / vāstavatve hi vyāvṛtteḥ vastusaṃsparśina ete doṣāḥ prāduṣyuḥ /	Judgments of perception do never refer to the points of reality. An exclusion which is referred to by a judgment of perception is not real. But it is merely an imaginary form which is attributed to the subject of a judgment.
na tv asau tayety uktam //	But the exclusion in question is not so.
ata eva yat kecana paryacūcudan kila vyāvṛttagrahaṇapakṣe tritayagrahaṇaṃ prāpnoti yat vyāvṛttaṃ yena ca nimittena vyāvṛttaṃ yataś ca vyāvṛttim iti /	Some objectors raise a new objection against the above conclusion of the Buddhists. They say that an awareness of exclusion involves three factors, viz., it refers to the object which is excluded, to those objects from which it is excluded and to the objective ground of exclusion.
na ca tritayagrahaṇam astīty ataḥ kathaṃ vyāvṛttagrahaṇam iti tad apy apāstaṃ bhavati yadi hi vyāvṛttaṃ gṛhṇīma ity evam ullekho bhavet vyavahartṛjanasya tadaivam asau paryanuyujyeta na tv evam astīty acodyam etat //	But the reasons which have been advanced by the Buddhists in favour of the hypothesis that a judgment refers to an exclusion are inconsistent. If the Buddhists admit the truth of the above finding then why do they indulge in sophistry and mystify apoha? The Buddhists meet this objection and solve the problem thus: The determinate perception of a cow follows in the wake of its indeterminate perception.
nanv evam āropitākāraviṣayā eva vikalpā uktā bhavanti /	Similar judgments also refer to a negative form which excludes the object in question from others.

But the proposition "This is a cow' does not assume the form "This is other than a horse, a cat and such other objects.' This judgment of perception does not refer to the point of reality.

The above reasons indicate that a judgment has only a passing reference to the negative form.

Words and judgments, constructed by imagination, have the same import. For this reason, it is held that words denote an exclusion from objects other than itself, i.e., a negative image-an apoha. The negative image in the form that this is an exclusion of all other than this is constructed by our imagination and is attributed to the image of the thing-in-itself.
so 'yam āropitākāro na bahiḥ āropitatvād eva /	As it is an attri- bution so it does not belong to the external world.
nāntaḥ abodharūpatvāt /	As it is not a form of consciousness so it does not belong to the inner world.

bāhyasya hi vastunaḥ svarūpeṇāvagatasya na vikalpāntaropanītabhāvasambandha upapadyate vaiyartyāt /	Moreover, in a negative judgment an apoha cannot be identified with negation since an apoha is determined as a real object and its identification with negation is self-contradictory.

It is an attribution. The real thing-in-itself seems to be identical with the imaginary object.

If this account of the Buddhists is taken to be true then does the ascertainment of the non-difference of the two said distinct objects amount to their identification? When we mistake the mother-of-pearls for silver as we fail to distin- guish between them so we cannot merely assert that they are different.
yathoktaṃ [vyākhyātāraḥ khalv evaṃ vivecayanti na vyavahartāraḥ] iti /	Similarly, we are not in a position to assert that sensible object is different from the imaginary object.

For this reason, it is stated that owing to the non-apprehension of difference between the two objects the person who judges an object moves for it. The thing-in-itself, a sensible object, which has practical efficiency is also found out since all the subsequ- ent events are causally linked up with the sensible thing-in- itself.

Though the subsequent judgment of perception propels him to bring the objects of perception yetNyayamanjarī he gets at the real object when he obeys the dictates of his determinate perception.

But if there is no real object at the root of his per- ception then an illusory judgment becomes his motive force which sets him in motion.

sāmānyam idam ity evaṃ kutas tatrānupagraḥaḥ /	A piece of cloth inheres in threads.
samānavṛttisāpekṣaṃ na ca sāmānyavedanam / tatra sannihitatvāt tu vyaktivan nānupagrahaḥ //	A jar inheres in its parts, i.e., pot- sherds. A piece of cloth does never exist apart from threads. But threads exist independently of a piece of cloth.
samānavṛttyapekṣatvāt sāmānyasyānupagrahe /	A thread inheres in its minute parts.
viśeṣo 'pi hi mā grāhi vyāvṛttiṃ sa hy apekṣate //	But a piece of cloth does not inhere in them.
vastv eva gṛhyate kāmaṃ kīdṛk tad iti kathyatām //	A jar always inheres in pot-sherds.

Though the parts of a whole can exist independently of a whole yet the whole cannot exist independently of its parts. Hence, as both the whole and its parts cannot exist independently of one ano- ther so they cannot be held to occupy distinct spaces.
ekabādhena nānyatra dhīḥ śuktrajatādivat // yatra hi virodho bhavati tatraikatararūpopamardena rūpāntaram upalabyate /	In such cases, where the two objects occupy the same space but are distinct from each other a distinct relation sub- sists between them as they are presented to our consciousness as related.
na caivam ihādarśanam ity avirodhaḥ //	This is called the relation of inherence.
citratvāt vastuno 'py evaṃ bhedābhedāvadhāraṇā] iti //	The above relation holds between a whole and its parts and a substratum and its attributes.
ity evam avirodhena bhedābhedāvadhāraṇāt / ubhayātmakataivāstu vastūnāṃ bhaṭṭapakṣavat //	In these two cases as they occupy no separate spaces so there is no doubt about the fact that they are inseparably connected.

tat pratyakṣamahimnaiva sarvaṃ pratihataṃ bhavet //	If a relatum does not exist, a relation cannot take place.
yat tāvad avādi bhedena kuvalayāmalakādivat anavabhāsanād iti tatra pratītibhedo darśita eva // yat tu deśabhedenāgrahaṇāt tadagrahe tadbadhyabhāvād iti tatra tadā śritatvaṃ kāraṇaṃ jāteḥ na tv asattvam /	If the Naiyāyikas admit that an individual exists prior to its relatedness then it is a case of relation which subsists between the two separable relata. Thus the thesis of the Naiyâyikas that the two relata are inseparable does not stand to reasons. This point has been answered by the great teachers of the Vaiseșika system.
vyaktivṛttitvāj jāteḥ pṛthagdeśatayā 'nupalambhaḥ tadagrahe tadagraho vā na punas tad atiriktāyā abhāvād eveti //	They hold that when- ever an individual comes into existence it becomes related to its universal. We do not give this answer simply following the convention of our school.
yad apy uktaṃ vṛttyanupapatter iti tatrāpy ucyate pratipiṇḍaṃ kārtsnyena jātir vartata iti /	But we say this because uncontra- dicted experience lends its mighty support to it.

We say this because it is impossible for them to be united with one another by a tie of relation. One cannot come in contact with another because there was no inter-space between them.
nanu ayutasiddhayoḥ sambandhaḥ samavāyaḥ /	The relation of conjunction takes place only when one comes in contact with another with which it has not been united.
sa ca vipratiṣedhād eva nirastaḥ na śakyate nirasitum pratītibhedād bhedo 'sti deśabhedas tu neṣyate /	An ubiquitous sub- stance inheres in none since it is self-sufficient. We have no experience as to the truth of the hypothesis that an omnipre- sent substance stands upon another such substance.

vibhūnām api sambandhaḥ parasparam asaṃbhavād eva neṣyate na svaśāstraparibhāṣaṇāt /	Moreover,656 Nyāyamanjarī they have put forward a dilemma, viz., either a universal is. omnipresent or it exists only in its individuals and subjected.

aprāptipūrvikā hi prāptiḥ saṃyogaḥ /	Experience is omnipotent.

yad api sarvagatatvaṃ piṇḍagatatvaṃ ca vikalpya dūṣitam tad api yat kiñcit /	We admit that all universals wholly inhere in every locus, i.e., in every individual without an exception.

sarvatrāgrahaṇaṃ tasyāḥ vyaṃjakavyaktyasannidheḥ // vyaktir vyaṃjakatām eti jāter dṛṣṭyaiva nānyathā /	But a universal is not perceived in every locus since a distinct individual is the manifestor of a uni- versal but is not available in every place. It is a well-known order of things that a particular individual manifests a distinct universal.
dṛṣṭir yatra yadā vyakteḥ tadā tatraiva tanmatiḥ //	Whenever the particular individual is perceived at a spot the universal manifested by it is also perceived there.
sarvata vidyate jātiḥ na tu sarvatra dṛśyate /	A universal is omnipresent but is not perceived everywhere.

vyakter anyatra sattve 'sya kiṃ pramāṇaṃ tad ucyate / ihāpy ānīyam ānāyāṃ gavi gotvopalambhanam // gopiṇḍena sahaitasyāḥ na cāgamanasaṃbhavaḥ /	Is there any proof that a universal occupies other spaces and does not solely inhere in individuals subsumed under a parti- cular class? The universal of cow-ness has not been seen at a spot.
dehenevātmanas tasmāt ihāpy astitvam iṣyatām //	If an individual cow is brought there the said universal is also perceived there.
abhivyaktis tu tatkālā yatkālaṃ vyaktidarśanam /	Whenever a distinct individual is seen a universal is also mani- fested.
tasmāt sakṛd abhivyaktā nānyadā 'pi pratīyate //	For this reason, if a universal is once manifested at a spot then it will not be perceived there at other times (i.
abhivyaktitaś ca taddeśā yaddeśā vyaktir īkṣyate /	e., when an individual which manifests it will be absent from the spot). The manifestation of a universal takes place at the spot where a distinct individual is perceived.
tasmāt tasmād abhivyaktā na deśe 'nyatra dṛśyate //	So, a universal is not seen at a spot where its manifestor does not exist.
vyaktisarvagatatve 'pi svayūthyaiḥ kaiścid āśrite / bhaviṣyaty adya jātāyāṃ gavi godhīs tathā grahāt //	Though the universal of cow-ness is shared by all individuals yet some thinkers hold that the class of individual cows is the special locus of it.
jāyamānaiva hi vaktiḥ jāyate pratiyoginī / eka eva hi kālo 'syāḥ jāteḥ sambandhajanmanoḥ //	Whenever an individual is born it becomes united with a uni- versal since the union with a universal and the birth of an in- dividual takes place simultaneously.
neha jāteḥ puro 'stitvaṃ na ca saṃkrāntir anyataḥ /	A universal does not reside in its locus before the beginning of the locus. A universal does not come to its new locus from an old one.
kin tu svahetoḥ sā vyaktiḥ tādṛśy evopajāyate // katham etad itīdaṃ ca ye vā paryanuyuṃjate /	But the material cause from which the locus of a universal comes into being enforces its union with a universal. If one questions: 'How does it take place?' then he finds fault with the cause of ano- ther effect.
idam apy aparaṃ hanta tena paryanuyujyatām //	Now, we put a question to you.
vṛṣaḥ viśaṅgo gauḥ kṛṣṇā sā ca nīlatṛṇāśinī /	A bull is tawny brown. A cow is black. She eats green grass. The pair procreates a white calf.
tābhyām utpādito vatsaḥ kathaṃ bhavati pāṇḍaraḥ yathā rūpādisambaddhā sā vyaktir upalabhyate /	How does an event like this take place? As an individual in which a universal finds its locus is not perceived if it does not possess attributes such as colour, etc., so if a locus does not possess attributes such as colour, etc., then a universal, located upon it, is not perceived.
tathaiva jātiyukteti kā te vyasanasantatiḥ agovyāvṛttatāyāṃ vā naiṣa praśno nivartate / kasmād agonivṛttaṃ tat adya jātaṃ svalakṣaṇam //	How does a calf (a thing-in-itself) which is born to-day become excluded from non-cows? In other words, if a calf is excluded from non-cows as soon as it is born then it becomes also united with a universal as soon as it is born.
tasmād vastusvabhāvasya vidhitvā 'nanuyojyatām /	Then you should suggest such types of real objects as are not exposed to blemishes.

If we had subscribed to this view then we would have been taken to task since an effect may be other- wise explained. As a universal is directly cognised so the above objection is absolutely baseless.

Is it eternal or non-eternal? Is it dependent upon or independent of a parti- cular? Is it sensed by us? Or, is it transcendental to our sense- organs? If we deny existence to a universal then the above pro- blems arise in our mind and press for their immediate solution.
nanu yathā gotvādijātiḥ niyatāsv eva vyaktiṣu vartate nāsāmaṃjasyena tathā kābhiścid eva vyaktibhiḥ kācid gavādibuddhir janyate iti naitad evam viṣayātiśayavyatirekeṇa pratyayātiśayānupapatteḥ /	As the Naiyāyikas hold that distinct universals such as the universal of cow-ness etc. stand upon distinct groups of individuals so the Buddhists may as well hold that some individuals of a particular group produce a common idea i. e., some individual cows produce the idea of cowness and that all individuals of a group are not required to produce it.
upāyātiśaye tu pratyayātiśayakāriṇīṣyamāṇe viṣayātiśayaṃ prati ko dveṣaḥ siddhe ca viṣayātiśaye durapahnavaṃ sāmānyam //	But why do cherish hatred against assuming a distinct object viz., a univer- sal?" If you admit the truth of the general law that a distinct idea has a corresponding distinct object then existence cannot be denied to a universal.

This is absurd. Hence, the hypothesis of a universal has no justification.
yadi hi senāvanādipratyayāḥ karituragadhavakhadirādivyatiriktam artham anapekṣya jāyamānā mithyā bhavanti kim etāvatā ghaṭādi pratyayair api mithyā bhavitavyam /	If the idea of an army without noticing elephants, horses etc. or that of a forest without noticing certain kinds of trees such as dhava, khadira (catachu) etc. arises in our mind then it turns out to be a false one. On this ground shall we hold that the idea of a jar shall also be wrong? Let us clarify the above argument of Jayanta.
bādhakasadasadbhāvanibandhanā hi vaitathyā vaitathasthitiḥ pratyayānām /	We employ the words 'army', 'forest' to signify their proper denotation.
tatra sattādau sāmānyāntaravirahān mithyā pratyayāḥ upādhinā kenacit pravartate na tv evaṃ gavādāv iti yat kiñcid etat /	The ideas conveyed by these words are also erroneous. In some cases, if we wrongly employ a word then it does not mean that in every case we wrongly use a word. Similarly, if some ideas are wrong then it does not mean that every idea is erroneous.
tad uktam [tasmād ekasya bhinneṣu yā vṛttis tannibandhanaḥ /	As they serve the same purpose so they produce in our mind the idea of oneness.

No doubt you have stated a rival hypothesis but it does not stand upon sound logical ground since the basic hypothesis that the different causes have the same practical efficiency has not yet been established.
yat tūktaṃ [ekapratyavamarśasya hetutvād dhīr abhedinī] iti tad apy asāṃpratam pratyavamarśasyāpy ekatvānupapatteḥ /	The Buddhists have also stated that concepts are identical since the causes of them are always the same.

But each concept follows in the wake of a sense-perception. Hence one concept is different from another concept. Thus concepts are many.
na ca teṣāṃ kim api kāryāntaram asti yena te ekatām adhigaccheyuḥ //	Concepts have no distinct part to play so that they may make the impression that they are the same.
kena ca vikalpānām ekatvaṃ gṛhyate na darśanena tasya dṛśyaviṣayatvāt /	How do the Buddhists know that they are identical? The identity of concepts is not sensed since sensible objects are only sensed.
na vikalpāntareṇa sarvavikalpānām āropitārthaparyavasitatvena svākāraviṣayatvena vā parasparabhedābhedaparicchedasāmarthyāsaṃbhavāt //	The Naiyāyikas will also point out that the above solution is not satisfactory since all concepts point to an imaginary object only or they cognise the form of an imaginary object only. But they are not competent enough to grasp their identity or distinction.
brūyāt vikalpollikhyamānākārabhedānavagamād vikalpānām aikyam /	All concepts reveal such forms as cannot be mutually distinguished.

Suppose, an individual cow the 'Sabaleya' is sensed. This sense percep- tion produces a concept. It reveals the general form of a cow. Another individual cow is sensed.

Hence, though sense-perceptions which produce concepts are different yet concepts present themselves in such a manner that the distinct identity of their causes cannot be traced.
vikalpās tāvad vijñānakṣaṇasvabhāvatvād anyonyaṃ bhinnā eva bhavanti //	As concepts are fleeting phenomena of consciousness so they are mutually distinguishable, But the distinct character of forms which they reveal are not made out.
yas tu vikalpollikhita ākāro 'nupalabhyamānabhedaḥ sa tebhyo vyatiriktaḥ avyatirikto vā vyatiriktaś cet sāmānyam evedaṃ nāmāntareṇoktam bhavati /	Is the form of a concept distinct from a concept itself? Or is it identical with the concept itself?Hypothesis of a Concept 661 This question should be answered at first.

Again, if it is held that the form of a concept is identical with the concept itself then these forms are mutually different as these concepts are and they cannot be unified. In that case how can the fusion of antecedent sense-perceptions into one be justified? Oh fool ! you do not admit the existence of a universal. But when you have been asked 'How do the similar concepts arise ? You have said 'Because sense-perceptions produce the same effect.
vikalpaikyaṃ kāryaikyam iti tu sutarāṃ anantaraṃ vikalpaikyaṃ vikalpaikyād evety uktaṃ bhavati /	viz. similar concepts'.
kathaṃ caivam anunmatto brūyāt tasmāt [ekapratyavamarśasya hetutvād dhir abhedinī-] ti vyāmūḍhabhāṣitam //	None but a mad man can give an answer like this. Hence it is foolish to state that pheno- mena of consciousness which produce identical phenomena of consciousness are identical.

They hold that proofs other than percep- tion are not so powerful that they will discover properties of an object, non-sensed by perception.

Or, suppose, if a substance is grasped in its entirety by an act of sense-perception and then is determined again by a number of perceptual judgments then will these judgments be futile? Can we conjecture on this account that determinate perception points to some thing which remains outside the scope of sense- perception? Certainly, we cannot indulge in a conjecture like this. Suppose, the thirst of a person has been quenched.

If this conclusion is accepted then we see nothing wrong with criticisms offered by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa.

They also hold that words also denote such an imaginary image. We cannot carry on worldly transactions with such an image.

Why should the judgment of per- ception only refer to an exclusion? The Buddhists may argue that if both types of perception refer to an exclusion then the judgments of perception should be futile as they simply repeat the work of sense-perception. Such an argument does not hold good. If the Buddhists hold that judgments of perception are true but futile owing to the fact that they merely refer to the known objects then the Naiyāyikas may agree with them in this point of criticism. The Buddhists may also hold that these judgments point to some other objects in order to free them from the charge of being futile.

nāntaḥ na bahir iti tu bhaṇitibhaṅgīmātram // tat tādṛśaṃ kiñcit na kiñcid vā na kiṃcic cet na tena vikalpā nāmanuraṃjanasyopapādayitum aśakyatvāt /	If they are neither external nor internal objects then they are merely empty words, Have such objects some degrees of reality or not? If they are absolutely unreal objects such as the horns of a hare they have no practical efficiency.
atyantam asataś ca kharaviṣāṇādeḥ vyavahāraviṣayatvābhāvāt asatkhyātinirasananītim evātrottaraṃ kariṣyāmaḥ //	Weshall follow the path already chalked out to refute the presentation of unreal objects and cri- ticise the hypothesis in question from that standpoint.
kiṃcic cet nūnamantaḥ bahir vā tena bhavitavyam eva /	A real object should be either internal or external.
ataḥ kumārilādiṣṭadūṣaṇāpaninīṣayā yo 'yam utprekṣitaḥ panthā nūtanaḥ so 'pi saṅkaṭaḥ /	Hence, the new path, devised by the Buddhists, in order to escape from the charges laid down by Kumärila.
tasmāt yathā 'dhyavasāyam eva tattvam iti yuktam //	Hence one should postulate objects corresponding to his judgments.
bāhye ca vastuni śabdāntaropanīyamānabhāvābhāvasambandhādy api na na yujyate / sarvasya gaur ityādiśabdajanitasya jñānasyāstitvādyanapekṣya sāmānyamātraviṣayatvāt /	If concepts refer to external objects then it is reasonable to hold that they are related to existence or non-existence imported by some other words. When we hear a word, viz., a cow, the awareness of a universal flashes in our mind. But the universal is not presented to our consciousness as related to existence or non- existence.
niyatarūpatā niścitanijarūpe vastuni vastvantarasya vyavacchedanibandhanā siddhyaty eva ghaṭo ghaṭa eva na paṭa iti /	The essential feature of an object is its everlasting property. It does not change. If the essence of an object is determined then it excludes itself from that of another object.

The Concluding Portion of the Proof of a Universal All such transactions take place with regard to external ob- jects. How do the Buddhists explain the movement of a person for an object? They say in reply that a perceiver moves for an object because he identifies a sensible object with a conceptual one. What is the character of this identification? If they hold that the identification in question stands for the non-detection of difference between a sensible object and a conceptual one then this state of mind resembles that of a person who has fallen665 Meaning of a Word into a swoon.
tat dṛśyam cet apohavyavahṛtir aphalā 'tha dvitīyaṃ cakāsti svenākāreṇa tasmin sati sunipatite ceṣṭate kaḥ sucetāḥ sphurati yadi vikalpyaṃ dṛśyarūpeṇa kāmaṃ sa bhavati viparītapratyayo nāvivekaḥ /	In that case, an apoha (an exclusion of heterogeneous ob- jects) has got no function to play. The Buddhists may hold that concepts are presented to our consciousness in their nega- tive character. In that case when a perceiver goes near an object why does he with his mental powers unimpaired move for it? If the Buddhists hold that a conceptual object appears to one as a sensible one then it is a case of illusion but not that of non- discrimination.
na vitatham atibījaṃ vidyate ceha kiñcit na ca ravikaranīrajñaptivad bādhakā dhīḥ //	An illusion having no ground does not take place. Moreover, this knowledge is not contradicted like the mistake of the rays of the sun for water.

It is consistent with the canon of logic that a person gets an external object because the judgment of perception is true. That is why the Naiyâyikas incline to discuss the topic that a word denotes an individual, its form and a universal.
evaṃ siddhe bāhye 'rthe nirasteṣu tadapahāriṣu tathāgatatas kareṣu adhunā vicāryate gośabdaḥ kim ākṛter vācakaḥ uta vyakteḥ atha jāteḥ iti //	Now the meaning of the word 'cow' is discussed. The subject matter of our discussion is 'Does it stand for the form of a cow or its universal?' Subject of inquiry: The meaning of a word such as a cow etc. When is the meaning of the word 'akṛti'? It denotes the form of an individual i.e.
tatrākṛtipadeneha saṃsthānam abhidhīyate /	the organisation of limbs of an individual.
sūtre pṛthag upādānāt na jātir jaiminīyavat // jaiminir hi [ākṛtis tu kriyārthatvāt] ity ākṛtiṃ jātim upadiśati /	Those who follow the foot-steps of Jaimini hold that the word 'Akṛti' denotes a universal. But the Naiyãyikas do not accept the said interpretation since in the Nyāya-Sūtra a distinction has been drawn between jâti and ākṛti.666 Jaimini in his Mīmāṁsā Sūtra negates the rival view and holds that äkṛti denotes a universal since the form of an animal is useful in a sacrifice but if a universal were abso- lutely different from a form in the above case, it would be absolutely useless.
bhāṣyakāro 'pi [sāsnādiviśiṣṭā ''kṛtir iti brūmaḥ] iti bravāṇaḥ tathaiva vyavaharati /	Sabara, the commentator on the Mimāṁsā Sūtra, sticks to the same interpretation since he says that a universal which is characterised by the form of an animal i. e.
vārtikakṛtā 'pi vyākhyātam [jātim evākṛtiṃ prāhuḥ vyaktir ākriyate yayā /	The etymological meaning of the word 'akṛti' is that it is such as determines an individual. A universal determines an individual.
sāmānyaṃ tac ca piṇḍānāṃ ekabuddhinibandhanam] iti //	A universal is the common property of all individuals. It is the source of the idea of oneness i.
iha tu [vyaktyākṛtijātayas tu padārthāḥ] iti sūtrakāraḥ pṛthag ākṛtiṃ jāter avocad iti saṃsthānam evākṛtiṃ manyate /	The author of the Nyâya-sutra holds that the primary meaning suggests that a form is distinct from a universal. Hence he is of the opinion that the word ‘ākṛti' denotes the form of an individual but not a universal.
loko 'pi avayavasanniveśātmikām ākṛtiṃ vyapadiśanti [yatrākṛtis tatra guṇā vasanti] iti /	An ordinary per- son also holds that the word 'akṛti' signifies an orderly arrangement of limbs of an individual. Merits reside in him who has a beautiful form.
tasmād avayavasanniveśa eva ākṛtir ucyate //	Hence, the word 'äkṛti' primarily denotes the orderly arrangement of limbs.
tasyāś ca śabdārthatopapadyate na vā iti parīkṣārhatvam asty eva na jaiminīyavad upekṣitaṃ sā yukteti /	We should now discuss whether the form of an individual is denoted by a word or not. Like the followers of Jaimini we should not disregard 'ākṛti' which is also one of the possible meanings of a word viz.
tadvyaktyākṛtijātisannidhau prayogāt gośabdasya ko 'rtha iti vicāryate // tatrākṛtivādinas tāvad āhuḥ prayogapratipattibhyāṃ kila śabdārthaniścayaḥ /	The establishment of the hypothesis that a word denotes only an individual. These who hold that an äkṛti is one of the meanings of a word have stated, "It is well known to all that the meaning of a word is ascertained by the two methods viz. the use of a word by a speaker and the understanding of its meaning by a listener.
buddhāḥ svārthe tadvyavaharantaḥ yasminn arthe gośabdaṃ prayuṃjate śrotāraś ca yam arthaṃ tataḥ pratipadyante sa tasyārthaḥ //	The experienced persons use the word 'cow' in order to convey a definite meaning. The listeners make out the exact mean- ing from that word. The meaning which they grasp is that of the word 'cow'.
tatra yadi gośabdaḥ kesarādimati na prayujyate sāsnādimati ca prayujyate tadasādhāraṇasanniveśaviṣaya evāvagamyate /	The experienced persons do not employ the word 'cow' to signify an animal having manes. But they intend to mean an animal having dewlap etc. Hence it is clear that the word 'cow' signifies a particular form.
pratyakṣaviṣaye gaur ityādipadaṃ prayujyate /	The word 'cow' is used to mean such an object as is sensed by us.
pratyakṣaṃ cākṛtiviṣayam /	The form of an object is perceptible.
aśvapiṇḍasanniveśād vilakṣaṇo hi gopiṇḍasanniveśa indriyeṇa pratīyate /	Our sense-organs point to the fact that the form of a cow is distinct from that of a horse.
tatkṛtam eva vastūnām itaretaravailakṣaṇyam / ataḥ pratyakṣaviṣaye padaṃ pravartamānaṃ ākṛtāv eva vartitum arhati / preṣaṇādikriyāyogaś ca vyaktidvāraka ākṛter bhaviṣyatīti yad uktaṃ tad ayuktaṃ prativyakti bhinnasaṃsthānadarśanāt /	This is the sum and substance of the thesis put forward by those who hold that the form of an object constitutes the meaning of a word. The above hypothesis does not stand the scrutiny of reasoning since the form of an object varies in every individual. It is not possible for one to know the rela- tion of denotation holding between a word and all forms of all individuals belonging to a class.
ānantyavyabhicārābhyāṃ sambandhajñaptyasaṃbhavāt //	If the word is related to every form then an infinite number of relations is to be postulated.
na niyatasya śābaleyasanniveśasya gośabdo vācakaḥ tadabhāve 'pi bāhuleyasanniveśadarśanāt /	The word 'cow' does not denote a particular form viz. the form of Sabaleya since it also denotes the form of Bahuleya which excludes that of Śabaleya.
na ca trailokyāntargatasakalagopiṇḍagatasanniveśavacanatvam avagantuṃ śakyam ānantyāt /	We cannot find out a single common form which belongs to all individual cows scattered over the three worlds and relate it with a word since the individual forms are infi- nite in number.
tataś ca nākṛtiḥ śabdārthaḥ tasyāṃ kriyā 'nupapatteḥ / na hi preṣaṇādikriyāsādhanaṃ sanniveśaḥ api tu vyaktiḥ //	For this reason we cannot hold that a word denotes the form of an individual. Moreover, the form of an668 object is not related to an action such as the act of sending etc. An individual is taken from one place to another but not its form.
na ca gām ānayety uktaḥ satyām api tadākṛtau /	It is an attribute. So it is not at all related directly to an action).
citraprastham ayaṃ kiñcit gām ānayati buddhimān //	According to them a univer- sal is all-pervasive.
nanu jātivācyatvapakṣe 'pi gotvajāteḥ sarvagatatvāt kim iti mṛdgavānayanaṃ nānuṣṭhīyate ucyate hastī tarhi kathaṃ nānīyate sarvagatatvāj jāteḥ /	If one says "Bring a cow" then why does he not bring an earthen cow? The universal of cowness as well belongs to an earthen cow, being itself ubiquitous. A reply to the above question is as follows: When one says, "Bring a cow" why does not the listener bring an elephant ? Because a universal is all pervasive.
atha sarvatrāstitve 'pi vyaṃjakavyaktiniyamenāpahnūyate hanta tarhi sāsnādimatprāṇī gotvajāter abhivyaṃjakaḥ na mṛdgava iti nātiprasaṅgaḥ /	Now, the upholders of the above view raising the above problem solves it in the following man- ner: Though a universal is present everywhere yet it is not presented to our consciousness as such. No individual can manifest all universals.
sanniveśasya ca tatra bhāvāt tadvācyatvavādinaḥ nainam atiprasaṅgam atikrāmanti //	A particular individual manifests a particular universal.
kiṃcākṛtivacanatve gośabdasya śuklādiguṇavācibhiḥ padāntaraiḥ sāmānādhikaraṇyaṃ na prāpnoti / na hi śuklādiguṇā ākṛtivṛttayaḥ api tu vyaktivṛttayaḥ / tatsāmānādhikaraṇyādibalavattayā varaṃ vyaktiḥ śabdārtha iṣyatām //	We regret to point out that it is only an animal, having dewlap, etc., which manifests the universal of cowness. That is why when we say "Bring a cow" an earthen cow is not brought since an earthen cow does not manifest the universal of cowness. More- over, as an earthen cow bears the stamp of a cow so if one says "Bring a cow" then he who holds that a word denotes only a universal cannot prevent the listener from bringing an earthen cow.
vyaktau tāvat kriyāyogaḥ jātau sambandhasauṣṭhavam /	The above proposition does not accord with the order of reality.
nākṛtau dvayam apy etat iti tadvācyatā kutaḥ jātivyaktyor ataḥ kāryā vācyatve saṃpradhāraṇā /	If a form is the meaning of a word then it is related neither to an action nor to a word. Why does an äkṛti (a form) constitute the meaning of a word? We should now determine which of the two, viz.
tatra vyaktyabhidheyatvavādibhis tāvad ucyate //	The upholders of the hypothesis that a word denotes only an individual say to this effect.
prayogacodanāsāmaṃjasyāt vyaktiḥ śabdārthaḥ / ālaṃbhanaviśanaprokṣaṇādicodanāḥ jātau na saṃgatā bhavanti /	669 An individual should constitute the primary meaning of a word if we take into consideration the consistency of the mean- ing of a word with injunctions governing the performance of the Vedic rites. If a universal is denoted by a word then injunc- tions with regard to cutting, killing, sprinkling, etc.
na hi jātir ālabhyate viśasyate prokṣyate vā //	become irrelevant since nobody can cut, or kill or sprinkle a universal.
api ca ṣaṭ deyāḥ dvādaśa deyāḥ caturvinśatir deyā iti na jātiḥ ṣaḍādisaṃkhyābhir yujyate api tu vyaktiḥ /	Moreover, there are injunctions which enjoin thus: "One should make a gift of 6 articles, of 12 articles, of 24 articles, etc." In these cases the number six, etc., cannot be connected with a universal.
tasmāt saiva śabdārthaḥ //	Hence, only an individual constitutes the meaning of a word.
api ca [yadi paśur upākṛtaḥ palāyeta anyaṃ tadvaṇa tadvayasamālabheta] iti yadi jātiḥ śabdārthaḥ syāt anyasyālaṃbho nāvakalpeta anyasyānīyamānasya paśudravyasya saiva jātiḥ /	In a sacrifice if an animal is offered to a deity but it manages to escape then an injunction runs to the effect that another anímal of the same class, having the same colour and age, should be slain. If a universal had been the primary meaning of a word then the killing of another animal would not have been possible.
tatrānyatvasambandho vyakter avakalpate na jāter ity ato 'pi vyaktiḥ śabdārthaḥ //	Hence, it cannot be qualified by the word 'another.'670 Nyāyamanjari But if an individual is the primary meaning of a word then the animal which has been brought will be well described as distinct from that which has filed.
cayāpacayasaṅghātasvasvāmitvādikalpanāḥ / yānti vyaktyabhidheyatvapakṣe jhaḍ iti saṅgatim //	If an individual is denoted by a word then the bringing to- gether of animals, the increase of number, their reduction of number, the killing of them and the relation of ownership, etc., are consistently explained.
na vyaktir lakṣaṇādvāraṃ iyat kāryaṃ ca yujyate /	This meaning is not well conveyed if it is held that an indi- vidual is the secondary meaning of a word.
vakraḥ panthā na gantavyaḥ praṣṭhe vahati vartmani //	If the straight path is available one should not go by a curved one.
upalakṣaṇam āśritya jātisambandhavedanam / prasetsyatīti nānantyavyabhicārakṛto jvaraḥ //	We shall also establish the point that though a word conveys an individual yet it has also secondary power of expressing a universal. Thus the apprehension of assuming an infinite number of relations and that of misrepresenting objects will disappear.
kiṃ ca pratyakṣaviṣaye vṛttiḥ padasyeṣṭā parair api /	Moreover, some other logicians (the Naiyāyikas) admit that words denote perceptible objects.
niṣkṛṣṭaṃ na ca sāmānyamātraṃ pratyakṣagocaraḥ //	A universal is not the only object which is perceived.
vyakter eva padārthatvaṃ tasmād abhyupagamyatām /	Therefore you must admit that an individual is only conveyed by a word.
tathā ca buddhis tatraiva śrutaśabdasya jāyate //	Whenever a listener hears a word he knows only an individual.
tad etaj jaimnīyair na kṣamyate /	Such a defence does not hold good.
tathā hi vyaktimātraṃ vā śabdārtha iṣyate viśiṣṭā vā vyaktiḥ na tāvat vyaktimātram na hi yasyāṃ kasyāṃcid vyaktau gośabdaṃ vaktāraḥ prayuṃjate /	Now, the upholder of the above hypothesis may argue that the word ('a cow') is employed to convey only that meaning which it has been found to be employed to denote. In other words, nobody employs the word 'a cow' to convey a white horse. Hence it does not denote a white horse.
na ca yāṃ kāṃcid vyaktiṃ gośabdāt śrotāraḥ pratipadyante //	Nobody has used the word 'a cow' to convey a new born calf since it has not been found to be employed in that sense.
atha gotvaviśiṣṭavyaktiḥ śabdārtha ity ucyata gotvam eva hi tarhi gośabdārthaḥ na vyaktiḥ /	Now it may be said that the word 'a cow' is employed to convey an individual which the universal of cowness belongs to. In other words, the universal of cowness regulates the use of the word 'a cow'.
katham śrūyatām yadi hi vyaktiḥ śabdārtho bhavet vyaktyantareṣu na prayujyeta / atha vyaktyantare 'pi prayujyate sarvavyaktisādhāraṇas tarhi tasyārthaḥ na vyaktiḥ //	Let us examine the solution in question. Does the universal regulate the employment of the said word, being itself known or unknown ? It cannot regulate, remaining unknown since if it could then the word would become too wide to denote any and every object.
nanu vyaktyntaram api vyaktir eva /	The awareness of any one of them points to that of another.
so 'yaṃ vyaktau gośabdaḥ prayuktaḥ na sāmānye maivam vyaktau cet gośabdaḥ prayujyate karkādivyaktāv api prayujyate /	The example, cited by the upholders of the above thesis, has no bearing upon the point in question. The word 'daṇḍi' is derived from a stem with a suffix attached to it.
tasmād darśanam akāraṇam prativyakti tasyāsaṃbhavāt //	Hence it may carry both senses. The stem in question is 'danda'. It denotes an adjective.
vyaktau śabdārthe [iyaṃ vā gauḥ iyaṃ vā gauḥ] iti pratipattiḥ syāt na tu [iyam api gauḥ] iti /	The suffix 'in' which is attached to the stem has the sense of sion. It denotes a noun. But the same logic does not apply to posses- the word 'cow'.
na cāyam avidyamānaniyantṛka eva yadṛcchāśabdaprayogaḥ pravartata iti niyāmakam asya cintyam //	In the above example the word 'dandi' does not denote an adjective and the word 'daṇḍa' does not denoteHypothesis of a word denoting an Individual 673 a noun.
gotvam eva niyāmakam iti cet āyuṣman sādhu budhyase /	It consists of two elements which are as good as two words.
kin tu tad gotvam avagatam anavagataṃ veti vaktum arhasi /	But in the case of the word 'cow' which has been compared it is a non-composite word which consists of no parts.
nānavagatam atiprasaṅgāt /	It stands for either a noun or an adjective.
avagataṃ cet kutas tad avagacchāmaḥ śabdāt anyato vā nānyataḥ pramāṇāntarāsannidhānāt /	If it denotes a noun and has got to convey the sense of an adjective then it may do it on receiv- ing the aid of some other sources of knowledge.
nanu jātiṃ viśeṣaṇatvena vyaktiṃ ca viśeṣyatvena vakṣyati gośabdaḥ na śaknoti vaktuṃ atibhāraprasaṅgāt / na ca vyaktyavagatau gatir anyā nāsti yata iyantaṃ śabde bhāram āropayema /	But it has no innate power of expressing an adjective. But if the word 'cow' denotes only an adjective then it may point to its noun since the universal of cowness which is an adjective does not stand unsupported. As it must stand upon a locus so it helps to infer the said locus.
na hi vayaṃ vyaktipratipattiṃ bhavantam apahnumahe /	We are not to blame if we say like this.
nāpi bhavantīṃ jātipratipattim apahnumahe ubhayapratīteḥ pratyātmavedanīyatvāt / ubhayatra cābhidhātrī śaktir atibhārā śabdasya anyatarapratītyā cānyatarapratītisiddheḥ /	We are to take a lot of troubles to prove that a word simultaneously denotes two meanings viz. a noun and an adjective. We do not also know that it successively con- veys two senses viz., it conveys the first meaning at the outset, stops for sometime and then conveys the second meaning.
tatra kiṃ jātau vartamānaḥ śabdaḥ vyaktiṃ āhosvid vyaktau vartamānaḥ jātim ākṣipatv iti vicāraṇāyāṃ jāter viśeṣaṇatvāt pūrvataraṃ pratipattir iti saiva śabdasyārtho bhavitum arhati /	If there is no word to denote an individual. But we know for certain that the knowledge of a universal is due to a word. The Naiyāyikas do also admit that a judgment presupposes the awareness of a predicate as its antecedent condition. Kanāda has also stated thus:-The colour 'whiteness' inheres in a sub- stance.
tasyāṃ ca śabdād avagatāyāṃ tata eva vyaktyavagamaḥ setsyatīti nobhayatra śabdo vyāpāraḥ //	When we know that the said colour is in a substance we know that the substance is white.
nanu daṇḍiśabdād iva viśeṣaṇaṃ ca jātiṃ viśeṣyāṃ ca vyaktiṃ gośabdād eva pratipatsyāmahe /	Well, as the word 'dandi' conveys the sense of a noun as well as an objective so from the word 'cow' we shall be able to learn an individual cow as a noun and the universal of cowness as its adjective.
ko 'syātibhāraḥ viṣamo 'yaṃ dṛṣṭāntaḥ /	But why do you say that it would be a heavy load on the part of the word 'cow' to convey these two mea- nings? A critic points out that the example in question is mis- matched.
tatra hi prakṛtipratyayavibhāgena dvayapratītir avakalpate / daṇḍaśabdaḥ prakṛtir viśeṣaṇam abhivadati /	In the above example the word 'dandi' consists of674 two parts, viz., the stem and the suffix. As it admits of two parts so one part conveys the noun and the other one communi- cates the adjective.
matvarthīyapratyayaś ca viśeṣyam iti /	The stem denotes an adjective and the suffix stands for a noun.
tatra na viśeṣaṇe daṇḍiśabdo vartate na ca viśeṣye daṇḍaśabdaḥ /	The word 'dandi' does not denote an ad- jective and the word 'daṇḍa' does not denote a noun.
iha tu gośabda eka eva viśeṣaṇe viśeṣye vā vartate /	But here the word 'cow' is a single one. It may convey either a noun or an adjective but cannot convey the both.
viśeṣye vartamāno viśeṣaṇe pramāṇāntaram apekṣate /	The metaphysical logic casts its shadow upon the science of grammar. It conveys a noun by implication.
viśeṣaṇe tu vartamāṇaḥ tadavagamayya viśeṣyam apy ākṣipatīti na kaścid doṣaḥ // tad idam ātmapratyakṣaṃ yat śabde uccārite vyaktir avagamyata iti / sā kiṃ śabdāt uta jāteḥ iti viveko na pratyakṣaḥ /	Every body knows from his own experience that whenever a word is uttered an individual is presented to our consciousness. We have no conclusive direct knowledge that an individual is directly communicated to us by a word but not implied by a universal. Consequently, a doubt arises in our mind, viz., either an individual which is a noun is conveyed by a word or it is implied by a universal, the meaning of a word.
sa yuktyā 'vagamyate /	The doubt in question is to be solved by means of logical discussion.
śabdasya dvayābhidhāne yatnagauravāt viramyavyāpārasya cāsaṃvedanāt antareṇāpi ca śabdaṃ jātyavagame vyaktipratītidarśanāt jātita evaiṣā vyaktipratītiḥ jātipratītiś ca śabdād iti niścīyate / bhavadbhir api ca viśeṣaṇajñānapūrvikā viśeṣyāvagatir aṅgīkṛtaiva /	More- over, no experience of us bears an evidence to the hypothesis that a word denotes a meaning at the outset, stops for some- time and then denotes another meaning. Our experience says that the awareness of an individual is produced by that of a universal even if there is no word to convey the noun. Hence the awareness of an individual is generated by the medium of a universal. The source of the knowledge of a universal is a word.
yathā ''ha kaṇavrataḥ [samavāyinaḥ śvaityāc chvaityabuddheś ca śvete buddhis te kāryakāraṇabhūte] iti //	You, the Naiyāyikas, have also admitted the truth of the hypothesis. Kaṇāda says “The colour 'white' inheres in a subs tance.
yat punar abhihitam ālaṃbhanaviśasanaprokṣaṇādikriyāyogāt vyaktiḥ śabdārtha iti tad apy anaikāntikam jātāv api kvacit kriyāyogadarśanāt [śyenacitaṃ cinvīta] iti //	There is casual relation existing between the awareness of the white 'colour' inhering in a substance and the judgment that the substance is white." It has been stated that as the verbs, viz., to cut, to kill, to sprinkle etc., are related to individuals so an individual consti- tutes the primary meaning of a word. The statement is falla- cious since in some cases verbs are also syntactically connected with verbs.
nanu atrāpi vyaktir eva kāryāṅgatā nāmūrtāyā jāteḥ maivam na hy atra śyenaḥ sādhanatvena nirdiśyate [paśunā yajeta] itivat /	It may be contested that an individual is only sub- servient to a Vedic rite, i.e., an action since a universal, a formless being, cannot be serviceable. Such a contention does not hold good.
[karmaṇy agnyākhyāyām] iti tv abhiyuktasmaraṇāt cayananirvartya śyena iti śabdārtho 'vagamyate /	The designation of a Vedic rite as fire is the title of this section. The wording of this text purports to convey that a hawk should be constructed after observing a few rites.
na ca śyenavyaktiḥ cayanena nirvartayituṃ pāryate /	A real-a bird hawk cannot be created by observing a few rites.
[agnyākhyāyāṃ] iti hi smaryate /	We also remember what has been stated in the chapter devoted to the naming of fire.
na hīṣṭakānicayena patatrī abhinirvartate /	It has been stated that a hawk cannot be created by piling bricks.
tadākāras tv agnir abhinirvartyata iti atra jāteḥ kriyāṅgatvaṃ na vyakteḥ // nanu vyaktyā sādṛśyaṃ saṃpādayiṣyate na śakyate saṃpādayitum vyaktyantaravaisādṛśyasyāpi saṃbhavāt /	But fire is so prepared that it assumes the form of a hawk. Hence a universal is subservient to a rite but not an individual. Now, it may be contested that the resemblance of fire to a hawk will be constructed. Such a contention does not hold water since resemblance is not a thing to be done.
yo hy ekayā vyaktyā sadṛśyaḥ so 'nyair visadṛśo 'pi bhavati //	What is similar to a particular hawk is also dissimilar to another hawk.
yat tu amūrtāyā jāter na kriyāṅgatvam iti naiṣa doṣaḥ /	The objection that a universal being formless, is not subservient to a rite is baseless.

vyaktyākṣepadvāreṇa cālaṃbhanaviśasanaprokṣaṇādiprayogacodanāsu sādhanatvaṃ jāter upapatsyate //	We shall also prove that a universal is also indirectly related to an action since an indi- vidual is implied by a universal. Hence the verbs, viz., to cut, to kill, to sprinkle etc.
lakṣitavyaktisādhyaṃ tu tatsādhyaṃ kāryam iṣyate / yathā bhūtendriyotpādyaṃ ātmakartṛkam ucyate //	are indirectly related to a universal.676 Nyāyamanjari A rite which is practicable by means of an individual, implied by a universal, is said to be practicable by the univer- sal itself just as an action which is performed by the body and the sense-organs is asserted to be done by the soul that dwells within the body.
ātmā tāvat sarvakarmasv adhikṛtaḥ kartā ca /	The soul is the enjoyer of the fruit of all actions. It is the doer of all actions.
sa cāmūrtatvāt dehendriyadvāreṇa audumbarīsaṃmārjanājyāvekṣaṇādīni kāryāṇi nirvartayan kartā teṣu bhavati/	It cleans the twigs of a fig- tree carefully, observes the sacrificial ghee, and does such other things through the instrumentality of its body and sense-organs. Thus it becomes the agent of an action, i.e., a doer.
evaṃ jātir api vyaktivartmanā tannirvartayantī sādhanatāṃ lapsyate //	Similarly, a universal performs an action through the help of an indi- vidual and becomes instrumental to an action.
ataś ca jātir evāṅgaṃ iti mīmāṃsakā jaguḥ /	Hence the Mimāṁsakas hold that a universal is instrumental to an action.
tasyāś cedaṃ kriyāṅgatvaṃ anyadvārakam ātmavat //	But it performs its action through the acvitity of something else just as the formless and static soul becomes the doer of an action.
evaṃ [ṣaḍ deyāḥ] iti [anyaṃ tadvarṇam ālabheta] iti ca taddvārakam eva yojyam /	They are as follows. One should make six gifts. If an animal dedicated to a god in a sacrifice runs away then another animal bearing a close resemblance to it should be killed.
etenopacayāpacayasaṃghātādy api vyākhyātam // sambandhagrahaṇādikāryaṃ ca jātipakṣa eva sūpapādam ānantyavyabhicārādicodyānavakāśāt //	Following the same line of thinking growth, reduction and aggregation etc., may apply to universals. Again, if we hold that a word denotes a universal then the relation of denotation holding between a word and a universal is easily cognised.
yat punar abhyadhāyi pratyakṣaviṣaye padaṃ vartate / na ca pratyakṣasya sāmānyamātraṃ viṣaya iti parihṛtaṃ tat vārtikakṛtā /	Hence, the power of denotation belonging to a word is infinite. Again if it is held that a Word denotes only an individual then a word is wrongly used since it is employed to convey an object which it does not denote.
pratyakṣasya hi citrātmakaṃ vastu viṣayaḥ //	There are the possible defects which vitiate the hypo- thesis that a word denotes an individual.
[na ca tat tādṛśaṃ kiñcit śabdaḥ śaknoti bhāṣitum /	The sum and substance of this objection is that a word cannot denote a universal only.
sāmānyāṃśān apoddhṛtya padaṃ sarvaṃ pravartate] iti //	All words denote objects, having a direct reference to a universal.
na hi nānādharmanicayakhacitacitrākāravastusamarpaṇanipuṇam ekaṃ kim api padam upapadyate /	There is not a single word which is logically conceived as competent to denote an object having various properties.
na ca tatra sambandhagrahaṇaṃ sukaram iti sāmānyāṃśaniṣṭḥam eva padaṃ yuktam /	It is not also easy to grasp the relation of denotation holding bet- ween the word and the object having various properties.
tasmāj jātir eva śabdārtha iti //	Hence, a universal is the only primary meanig of a word.
atrābhidhīyate na jātiḥ padasyārtho bhavitum arhati /	A universal does not constitute the primary meaning of a word (i.e. pada) used in a sentence.
padaṃ hi vibhaktyanto varṇasamudāyaḥ na prātipadikmātrām /	A pada is the combination of letters with an inflexion attached to it but is not a mere stem.
tatra ca prakṛtipratyayāv itaretarānvitam artham abhidadhāte iti sthitam / dvitīyādiś ca vibhaktiḥ prātipadikād uccārantī prātipadikārthagatatvena svārtham ācaṣṭe / yugapac ca tritayaṃ vibhaktyarthaḥ kārakaṃ liṅgaṃ saṅkhyā ca /	The law of grammar holds that a stem and an inflexion their mean- express ings which are mutually related. When an inflexion such as the second case-ending etc., is attached to a stem the meaning of an inflexion is presented to our consciousness derived from a word as a substantive and that of a stem denotes a universal then the meaning of an inflexion cannot be related to a uni- versal.
na jātiḥ kārakaṃ /	A universal cannot be a case.
na ca jāteḥ strīpuṃnapuṃsakavibhāgaḥ / na cāsyā dvitvādiyoga iti //	It has got no gender masculine, feminine or neuter. Moreover, it cannot be marked with a number such as 'two', 'three' etc.
nanu vyaktilakṣaṇayā sarvam upapatsyate ity uktam na ca yuktam uktam sakṛtprayuktaṃ padam aṃśena kaṃcid artham abhivadati /	Now, the upholders of the above hypothesis may contend that all these difficulties will be solved because an individual is the secondary or implied meaning of a word. The Naiyãyikas678 join issue with them and point out that the above solution is not satisfactory.
tato 'rthāntaraṃ lakṣyati /	It parti- ally expresses a meaning by its primary power and then again conveys a different meaning by its secondary power.
tadgatatvena punaḥ liṅgasaṅkhyādy abhidhatte iti na prātītiko 'yaṃ kramaḥ // sākṣāt tadanvitatvena kathyamānaṃ tv asaṅgatam /	This order of the presentation of a meaning in its relational character is not borne out by our experience. (A word once uttered com- pletely expresses its meaning. It does not gradually convey its meaning.
tad bhaved agninā siṇcet ityādividhisannibham //	It looks like a contradictary injunc- tion that one should wet with fire.
nanu puṃsīva sāmānye kārakatvaṃ bhaviṣyati / kakṣyāntaritam ity eṣaḥ yukto vaibhaktiko 'nvayaḥ //	Though the relation is not direct yet why will not it be logi- cally tenable? When an inflexion conveys its meaning it does it as related to the meaning of a stem, viz, a universal.
prātipadikārthasāmānyagatatvenaiva vibhaktyā svārtho 'bhidhīyate na lakṣitavyaktivṛttitvena yato 'bhidhānavaiṣamyaṃ syāt /	But it is not the aim of an inflexion to convey its meaning as related to the secondary meaning of a stem since if it does so, there will be no uniformity in conveying the primary meaning of a word.
sa tu vibhaktyartho jātau sākṣād asaṃbhavan kakṣyāntarito bhaviṣyati naitat ātmano jñānaprayatnādiyogitvena kārakatvopapatteḥ /	A soul is logically called the author of an action since it has consciousness, voli- tion etc. But a universal is eternally static and is in no way related to a process.
ataḥ kathaṃ tatra vibhaktyarthānvayaḥ yad anvitaṃ ca saṅkhyādi tatsthatvena na kathyate /	So in grammar a universal is never used as a case. Hence how will the meaning of an inflexion be rela- ted to a universal? It can in no way be related to a universal.
kathyate yadgatatvena na tat tena samanvitam //	But the former does not belong to the latter.
na ca vyavahitavyaktipratītiṃ manyate janaḥ /	No body experiences that a number is indirectly related to a universal through the medium of an individual.
nānyathā 'nupapattyā 'pi kramasamvedanaṃ kvacit //	A universal does not constitute the primary meaning of a word.
janayantīṃ ca paśyāmaḥ vyaktiṃ jātyanuraṃjitām / saṅkhyādiyoginīṃ ceti sā vai dhatte padārthatām // jāteḥ kāryānvayaḥ śyenācitam ity abhyadhāyi yat /	The Mimâmsakas have held that a universal is directly related to a Vedic action. They cite an example, viz. 'One should arrange fire in the shape of a hawk.' In this case the form of a hawk has been mentioned.
tatra saṃsthānanirdeśāt na jāteḥ kācid aṅgatā //	There is no reference to a universal. Hence a universal is not directly subservient to an action.
śyenavyaktyā cet sādṛśyam iṣṭakākūṭasya nāsti vyaktyantareṇa vyabhicārāt na tarām amūrtayā jātyā sādṛśyam ākāśeneva tasyāvakalpata iti spardhodāharaṇamātram etat //	The argument of the Mimāṁsakas is not convincing because the universal of hawkness is formless and it is highly inconsistent to hold that the said pile is similar to a universal, It is as good as to say that it is similar to the sky. The example in question does no service to them.
anyeṣu tu prayogeṣu gāṃ dehīty evamādiṣu tadvato 'rthakriyāyogāt tasyaivāhuḥ padārthatām //	There are many other verbal usages such as 'Give a cow' etc., in which an individual having the universal of cowness is syntactically connected with the verb 'to give'.
padaṃ tadvantam evārthaṃ āṃjasyenābhijalpati /	So the learned men hold that the primary meaning of the word 'cow' is only an individual possessing the universal of cowness.
na ca vyavahitā buddhiḥ na ca bhārasya gauravam // sāmānādhikaraṇyādivyavahāro 'pi mukhyayā / vṛttyopapādyamānaḥ san nānyathā yojayiṣyate //	A word primarily denotes one characterized by a universal. It is not logical to hold that the meaning of inflexion is at first related to an individual and then becomes related to an indivi- dual and then becomes related to a universal.
tasmāt tadvān eva padārthaḥ //	So this view is not correct.
nanu ko 'yaṃ tadvān nāma tat asyāstīti tadvān iti viśeṣa eva sāmānyavān ucyate //	What is the exact meaning of the word ('tadvān' having that)? The literal meaning is that this has that. The demonstrative pronoun "this' stands for a near individual.
viśeṣavācyatve cānantyavyabhicārau tadavasthau /	Hence the meaning of the word amounts to an individual having a universal.
sāmāṇyaṃ tu śebde nānucyamānaṃ nopalakṣyamāṇaṃ bhavati /	But as there is no word to denote a universal so a universal cannot be used as an objective.
ubhayābhidhāne ca śabdasyātibhāra ity uktam ucyatenedantānirdiśyamānaḥ śābaleyādiviśeṣaḥ tadvān /	If the opponents hold that a word denotes both an individual and a universal then they load a word with the heavy burden of conveying two distinct objects. We have already discussed this point.
na ca sarvas trailokyavartī vyaktivrātas tadvān /	Moreover it does not denote all individual cows in the universe.

There are a few charges which are levelled against some hypothesis viz.

A universal is a property of its substratum viz.
kiṃ ca pratyakṣaṃ na hi niṣkṛṣṭajātyaṃśapariveṣṭitam /	Perception reveals both, víz. an individual and a universal.
tadgocarapravṛttaś ca śabdas taṃ kathyet katham tasmāt pratyakṣaviṣaye pravartamānaṃ tatsamānaviṣayam eva bhavitum arhati padam na sāmānyamātraniṣṭham //	When a word is employed to denote an object of perception how is it that it denotes only a universal? Therefore we arrive at the conclusion that if a word is employed to denote an object as is perceived then a word should also mean the same object.
yugapan nanu saṃvittiḥ viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyayoḥ /	They point out that a substantive and a predicate are not simultaneously perceived.
pratyakṣe 'pi na dṛṣṭaiva na ca yuṣmābhir iṣyate //	The Naiyāyikas even do not admít such a perception.
kāryakāraṇabhāvo hi taddhiyor bhavatāṃ mate /	The direct awareness of a predicate and a judgment are causally related to each other.
tasmād viśeṣaṇe jātau pūrvam indriyajā matiḥ //	Hence, the sense perception of a universal takes place at first.
padād api tadāyattasambandhajñaptyapekṣiṇaḥ /	Therefore, it has a reference to a universal for the relation of denotation informs of it.
tatraiva buddhir ity eva na vyakter api vācyatā //	Hence, the primary meaning of a word is a universal but not an individual.
ucyate pratyakṣe tāvat dvayor api viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyayoḥ indriyaviṣayatvam / sāmānye 'pi saṃyuktasamavāyād indriyaṃ pravartamānaṃ viśeṣaṇavat viśeṣyam api viṣayīkaroti /	Both the subject and the predicate are perceived. Whenever a universal is perceived the sense-object contact in the shape of conjunction cum inherence is required. For this reason whenever a sense-organ senses a universal it senses an individual, the locus of a universal.
na hi sāmāṇyaṃ pratyakṣaṃ viśeṣo 'numeya iti vyavahāraḥ /	We do not say that an individual is only perceived and its substratum is an inference.
evaṃ guṇamātragrāhiṇīndriye guṇino 'numeyatvaṃ syāt /	If we think with the Mimãmsakas then we should admit that our sense organ senses an attribute but the substance which possesses it is an inference.
na caivam asti /	But there is no such provision in the logical code of the Mimamsakas.
tasmād viśeṣyaparyantaṃ pratyakṣam /	Hence we hold that the substratum of a universal is also perceived.
tathā padam api tattulyaviṣayaṃ na tu sāmānyamātraniṣṭham iti yuktam //	As there is perfect co-ordination between the meaning of a word and the content of perception so it is not logical to hold that a word denotes only a universal.
yat tu [sāmāṇyāmśān apoddhṛtya padaṃ sarvaṃ pravartate] iti tat kevalavyaktyabhidhāne sati ānāṇtyavyabhicārabhayād ucyate /	Kumarila has stated that a word is always employed with the main purpose of conveying a universal, the element of an object since if we hold that a word denotes only an individual then we are to admit that a word has infinite power of denoting682 innumerable individuals and when it conveys its meaning it transcends its power of denotation.
tadvadabhidhāne tu tadbhayaṃ nāstīti na śuddhajātyabhidhāyitayā śabdasaṃkocanīyaḥ // nanu na sarvātmanā pratyakṣatulyaviṣayaḥ śabdaḥ pratipattisāmyaprasaṅgāt /	But we are not to face the difficulty of meeting all these objections if we hold that a word denotes the locus of a universal. Therefore we should not impose limitation upon the meaning of word, subscribing to the hypothesis that a word denotes only a universal.
na ca śabdāt indriyāc ca tulye pratipattī bhavataḥ / tad uktaṃ [anyathaivāgnisambandhāt dāhaṃ dagdho 'bhimanyate] ityādi ucyate pūrvam evaitat parihṛtam /	The Mimāṁsakas may further contend that a word and the corres- ponding perception of its meaning do not refer to the same object. If we admit that they do so then the knowledge derived from a word will be identical with that derived from sense organs.
sakalaviśeṣagrahaṇāgrahaṇābhyāṃ pratipattiviśeṣasiddheḥ /	The reason behind their non-identity is this that when we perceive an object we grasp all its specific.
dharmyabhiprāyeṇa ca saṃplavasyoktatvāt /	Hence, the distinction of verbal knowledge from perceptual one is established.
naitāvatā sāmānyamātre niṣṭhaḥ śabdo bhavati //	Its underlying suggestion is this that a word denotes only a universal.
api ca niṣkṛṣṭasāmānyāṃśavacanatve padasyeṣyamāṇe gośabdāt gotvaśabdāc ca tulye pratipattī syātām /	Moreover, if it is admitted that a word denotes only a universal then the word 'a cow' and 'cowness should convey the same meaning.
[gauḥ śuklaḥ] itivac ca [gotvaṃ śuklaṃ] iti buddhiḥ syāt /	There should be the judgment that cowness is white like the judgment. "A cow is white".
cāturvaṇyādivac ca svārtha eva gośabdāt bhāvapratyayaḥ tvatalādiḥ syāt //	The suffixes 'tva' 'tal' etc. conveying an abstract property should only signify the meaning of the stem to which they are attached.

nānyathā hi sāśrayavaty uktā syāt /	A universal, detached from an individual, is never found out.
tathā cāhuḥ [yasya guṇasya hi bhāvāt dravye śabdaniveśaḥ tadabhidhāne tvatalādayaḥ] iti /	If you hold that when the word 'cow' is heard the universal of cowness is known as associated with the universal of cowness but when the word 'cowness' is heard a universal-in-itself is only known.

When we intend to express only a universal as independent of its locus we use words ending in suffixes viz.
tathaiva vyaktiparyantaḥ śabdavyāpāra iṣyatām //	are attached to these nouns. Let us explain with reference to a familiar example.
anuparatavyāpāre śabde tadavagamāt //	The word 'cow' is employed since the universal belongs to it.
yenānvitābhidhānaṃ ca padānām abhyupeyate / sutarāṃ tena vaktavyā vyaktyantā padato matiḥ //	We have already stated that in the preposition "A cow is white" the relation between the sub-684 ject and the predicate is squarely explained if we subscribe to the hypothesis that a word denotes a concrete individual. i.e.
na hi vyaktyanapekṣāṇāṃ jātīnām itaretaram /	Moreover, universals do not get themseleves inter-connected without a reference to particulars.
anvayo 'nanvitānāṃ ca nābhidhānam iti sthitiḥ // gaṅgāyāṃ ghoṣa ityādau yathā sāmīpyalakṣaṇā / naivaṃ gauḥ śukla ityādau gamyate vyaktilakṣaṇā //	As the word 'Gangayam' in the sentence 'Gangayam Ghoşah' (there is a village of cowherds on the banks of Ganges, the river) indicates a place, adjacent to the flowing river 'Gan- ges', on the strength of its secondary meaning so the word 'cow' in the sentence "A cow is white" does not mean as indi- vidual cow by means of its secondary meaning.
prayogapratipattibhyāṃ vṛddhebhyo 'dhyavasīyate /	The meaning of a word is learnt if we carefully understand the meaning of the said word noting its usage by the experienc- ed persons.
tasmāt gavādiśabdānāṃ tadvān artha iti sthitam //	We learn from the usage that words like cow etc. signify concrete individuals i.e.
tad idam uktaṃ sūtrakṛtā [vyaktyākṛtijātayas tu padārthaḥ] iti [tu]śabdo viśeṣaṇārthaḥ /	The author of Nyaya-sutra says that the meaning of a word consists of an individual, a universal and a form. In the above sutra there is a particle 'in'.
kiṃ viśeṣyate guṇapradhānabhāvasyāniyamena śabdārthatvam /	What does it determine? It determinesFunction of a word denoting an Individual the selection of a particular meaning as a principal one from the meanings according to the merit of a particular case.
śite 'pi tadvato vācyatve kvacit prayoge jāteḥ prādhānyaṃ vyakter aṅgabhāvaḥ yathā [gaur na padā spraṣṭavyā] iti sarvagavīṣu pratiṣedho 'vagamyate /	Though a concrete individual constitutes the meaning of a word yet in some cases the universal plays the important part and a particular occupies a subordinate position. Let us cite an example "A cow should not be injured." It is universal prohibition. This prohi- bition applies to all cows.
kvacid vyakteḥ prādhānyaṃ jāter aṅgabhāvaḥ yathā [gāṃ muṃca] [gāṃ badhāna] iti niyatāṃ kāṃcid vyaktim uddiśya prayujyate /	In some cases an individual plays the most important part and the universal sinks down into a subordi- nate position. Let us cite examples viz. "Untie a cow", "enchain a cow" etc.

If we use sentences in order to create mere forms then universals do not belong to earthen cows and similar objects though the universals are all pervasive. The absence of universals from such objects has been already established.
tad evaṃ gavāśvādiśabdānāṃ tāvat tadvān artha iti siddham //	Hence, the meaning of a word is a concrete individual.
yeṣām artheṣu sāmānyaṃ na saṃbhavati taiḥ punaḥ /	It is impossible for a few words to denote univer- sals. They merely denote particulars.
ucyate kevalā vyaktir ākāśādipadair iva // evaṃ ḍitthādiśabdānāṃ saṃjñātvavāditātmanām /	Words like the sky etc. constitute examples of such cases. There are proper nouns such as Dittha etc. which are well known as names.
abhidheyasya sāmānyaśūnyatvād vyaktivācitā //	They stand for individuals since objects which they mean are devoid of univer- sal.
ata eva hi dravyaśabdā ity ucyante //	So, a word like Dittha is called a dravya-Sabda (the name of a substance).
ye punaḥ kalpitānekabhedavṛttiṃ pracakṣate / vācyaṃ tatrāpi sāmānyaṃ atīva grāhikās tu te //	685 Those who hold that a universal belongs even to an indivi- dual which admits of imaginary distinctions should also hold that a universal resides in the individual known as Dittha since there are several individuals designated by the name Dittha'.
na hi ḍitthatvasāmānyaṃ dṛśyate gaganatvavat / kalpanāyās tu no bhūmiḥ kācid asti vipaścitām //	Why are you so opinionated? As there exists no such universal as skyness so there exists no universal as Ķitthatva. There is no scope for the vise to indulge in pure imagination with regard to this topic.
guṇaśabdās tu kecit svajātyavacchinnaṃ guṇam abhidhāya tāvaty eva viramanti / kecit tu guṇam abhidhāya dravyam apy ākṣipanti tatsāmānāḍhikaraṇyaprayogadarśanāt // guṇaikaniyatās tāvat gandhārūparasādayaḥ /	There are a few abstract nouns. They signify only attributes characterized by species which exclusively belong to them. There are some other abstract nouns which stand for attributes but imply substances by their secondary sense since in some categorical propositions a term denoting a substance is used as a subject and a term, denoting an attribute, is used as a686 predicate and a copula which stands for the relation of identity unites them.
gandhatvādivyavacchinnagandhādiguṇavācinaḥ //	Words like scent, sound, taste etc. signify only attributes having specific characteristic features.
teṣāṃ na dravyaparyantā vṛttiḥ kvacana dṛśyate /	They never imply substances.
na gandhaḥ padmaṃ ity asti sāmānādhikaraṇyadhīḥ // na hy evaṃ vaktāro bhavanti [candanaṃ gandhaṃ] [āmraṃ rasaḥ] iti //	The proposition that a lotus is scent is never used. Scent is never used as a predicate which is asserted of a lotus since no body says that rice is scent and a mango is taste.
guṇaṃ śuklādiśabdās tu kathayantas tadāśrayam /	There are some words such as Sukla etc. which signify attributes but imply substances.
dravyam apy ākṣipanty eva śuklo 'śur iti darśanāt //	It is seen that in order to convey a white substance the word 'white' is only used.
śuklādayo 'pi śabdāḥ guṇapadopabandhasaṃkecitaśaktayaḥ bhāvaprayayāntapadavat guṇamātrābhidhāna eva paryavasyanti [śuklo guṇo 'śvaḥ] [śauklyam aśvaḥ] iti sāmānādhikaraṇyaprayogādarśanāt //	But when we associate with the word 'white' with the word 'attribute' the word 'white' does not imply a substance as its power of implying a substance is restricted. These words like words having suffixes indicative of abstract qualities (whiteness etc.) exclusively denote attri- butes.
kriyāśabdaś ca dvividhā bhavanti kecit kartari karmaṇi karaṇe vā prayujyante kecid bhāvamātravacanā eva /	There are two kinds of verbal nouns. Among verbal nouns some denote nominative case of a verb, some objective case, some instrumental case, some other cases. But some verbal nouns exclusively denote verbs.
kartrādivācinas tāvan nimittīkṛtya kāṃcana kriyāṃ tadyogidravye vartate pācakādayaḥ //	The above ones refer to a verb at the outset and then signify a substance which is connected with it. The word 'păcaka' (a cook) is an example of the first type of words.
yatrāpi tatkriyāyogaḥ tadānīṃ nopalabhyate /	Though the connection with a verb is not directly noticed yet it has capability of being connected with a verb.
tatrāpi yogyatāṃ dṛṭvā śabdaṃ tajjñāḥ prayuṃjate //	The experts noticing such capability use such words.
na hi [pācakaḥ] [lāvakaḥ] iti pravṛttakriya evocyate anyadā 'pi tathā tathā vyavahārāt //	When we use words like pãcaka (a cook), läāvaka (a cutter) etc., we do not mean to say that a cook is cooking and a cutter is cutting.
siddharūpatayā prāhuḥ śabdāḥ pākādayaḥ kriyām // tad uktam [kṛdabhihito bhāvaḥ dravyavad bhavati kriyāvac ca] iti /	We have noticed usages even in the absence of a verb. A verbal noun of course denotes a verb. But it does not denote it as a process which is in the making. It denotes it as an accomplished fact.
na caikāntena parihṛtasādhyamānāvasthaiva taiḥ kriyocyate yata āha [kriyāvac ca] iti // anyatpravṛttau śabdasya nimittam avagamyate /	There is no reference to the different stages of an act which precede and succeed. A verbal noun which is derived from a root in the passive voice with a suffix attached to it has a double character.
abhidheyaṃ tu tasyānyat ity ayaṃ prathamaḥ kramaḥ //	So it has been said that it looks like a verb.
pācakādiśabdānāṃ hi pravṛttau nimittaṃ kriyā / abhidheyās tu kartrādayaḥ //	the word 'pacaka'. The act of cooking gives us the cue of its use. The nominative case of the act of cooking is its primary meaning.
kvacit punar yad evāsya syāt pravṛttinibandhanam / tasyaiva vācyatā bhāvapratyayāntapadeṣv iva //	L There are a few words which are derived from a root in the passive voice with kṛt suffix attached to it. The cue of their use is identical with their primary meaning.
ity evaṃ leśatas tāvat nāmnāṃ vṛttir udāhṛtā /	Thus we have stated the primary meanings of nouns.

kecit tu nāmabhir abhisambadhyate yathā īṣadarthavācinaḥ [āpiṅgaḥ] ityādayaḥ / anye kriyāgarbhatayā nāmnā sambadhyante /	There is a general rule that some indeclinables become prepositions when they are prefixed to verbs. Some prepositions are annexed to nouns e.g., pra- vayaḥ.
yathā pragataṃ vayaḥ yasya saḥ pravayā iti //	It means one who has advanced in age.
anye dhātor vicitrārthatām āpādayantaḥ tadviśeṣaṇatvena sambadhyante / yathoktam [upasargavaśād dhātur arthāntaravilāsakṛt /	Other preposi- tions modify verbs and determine their meanings in various ways. The above view has been expressed by some thinkers. 687 When a root is prefixed by different prepositions it admits of various meanings.
prahārāhārasaṃhāravihāraparihāravat] //	If it is preceded by the preposition 'pari', it is synony- mous with the root 'to give up'.
nanu ca kvacid upasargo dhātvartham eva bādhamāno dṛśyate /	Sometimes we see that a preposition, preceding a root cancels its meaning.
yathā [prasthitaḥ] iti gatinivṛttivācī dhātuḥ pravṛttagativacanatāṃ nītaḥ praśabdena /	Let us take an example viz., prasthita. (started). The primary meaning of the root 'stha' (to stay) is to stop all motion. When it is prefixed by 'pra' it expresses the sense of going.
na cedṛśaṃ viśeṣaṇaṃ bhavitum arhati //	An adverb should not contradict the original meaning of the root which it is expected only to modify.
viśeṣaṇaṃ tad eveṣṭaṃ na tu yat svārthanāśanam //	An abjective which characterizes a noun but does not mar its sense is a true adjective.

naiṣa doṣaḥ arthāntarābhidhānasāmarthyāpādanam eva dhātor vidadhad upasargo viśeṣaṇaṃ bhavitum arhati /	An abjective does not repudiate the meaning of its noun. Whenever a preposition is connected with a verb it brings688 about a change in the meaning of the original root.

prakṛtānupayogitvāt ihaitan na vicāryate // anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ tadartho hy avadhāryate /	We shall not discuss the point either a preposition denotes a meaning or indicates it since it is irrelevant to the issue in ques- tion.
tadāgame tatpratīteḥ tadabhāve tadagrahāt // te tu kiṃ vācakās santaḥ tadavagatim upadadhati kiṃ vā dyotakāḥ iti kim anena //	If a root is preceded by a preposi- tion then it conveys a certain meaning but if it is not preceded by the same it does not convey the same meaning. Do the pre- positions denote a meaning? Or do they indicate it.
evaṃ samuccayādivācināṃ cādinipātānāṃ [vṛkṣaṃ prati dyotate] iti karmapravacanīyānāṃ ca arthaḥ prayogapratipattibhyām avadhāraṇīya ity alaṃ prasaṅgena //	We shall not enter into this discussion, There are a few indeclinables such as 'ca' etc., which express the sense of conjunction. There are a few prepositions which are used independently of verbs. An example of the type of prepositions is this "Brkşam prati dyotate". The meaning of such prepositions will be determined by usage and common sense.
ayam asya padasyārtha iti kiṃ cintiteta vā / yo 'rthaḥ pratīyate yasmāt sa tasyārtha iti sthitiḥ //	Some thinkers hold that this word conveys this meaning. Or, if a particular meaning is communicated by a particular word the meaning is denoted by it.
spaṣṭām api tu ye buddhiṃ nirūpayitum akṣamāḥ /	There are persons who have the power of understanding but cannot make out the meaning of a word.

kecid ācakṣate bāhyasya vākyārthasyāsaṃbhavāt padārthasaṃsarganirbhāsaṃ jñānam eva vākyārtha iti //	689 The Rival Hypotheses on The Meaning of a Sentence. (1) Some logicians hold that a sentence cannot refer to ex- ternal objects. It refers to ideas in their non-relational cha- racter.
anye tu vāstavaḥ padārthānāṃ parasparasaṃsargo bāhya eva vākyārtha ity āhuḥ // anyavyavacchedo vākyārtha ity apare śuklādipadāntaroccāraṇe kṛṣṇādinivṛtter avagamāt //	Though the ideas are not mutually related yet they appear as external objects standing in relation to one another. (2) Some other logicians hold that the relation which takes place among the meanings of words in a sentence is real but not imaginary. A sentence refers to external objects.
apare saṃgirante saṃsargasya durapahnavatvāt tasya ca guṇaparadhānabhāvagarbhatvāt guṇībhūtakārakanikaranirvartyā pradhānabhūtā kriyā vākyārtha iti //	(4) Another sect of logicians conjectures that a sentence without taking the risk of being denied points to the relation holding among parts of speech, and holds that their meanings are arranged in order of their position viz.
anye manyante bhāvyaniṣṭhaḥ puruṣavyāpāraḥ karotyarthā bhāvanāśabdavācyo vākyārthaḥ /	(5) Some other logicians suppose that a sentence signifies the operation of an agent directed toward an end, it is known as the meaning of the verb 'karoti' and it is also designated as bhāvanã.
liṇādiśabdavyāpāravācyas tu śabdabhāvanākhyaḥ puruṣasyārthabhāvanānuṣṭhāne pravartakaḥ sa vidhir ucyata iti //	The optative suffix lín denotes a particular kind of operation. It is called sabda- bhāvanā. It has an injunctive force in it. It impels a person to activity which is directed towards an end.
anye bruvate dvayābhidhāne liṇādeḥ pratyayasya bhāragauravat vidhir eva vākyārthaḥ sa evānuṣṭheyaḥ pravartakaś ceti //	(6) Someother logicians point out that if the lin suffix denotes the above two meanings then it violates the law of parsimony and suggests that a sentence signifies an injun- ction. The injunction should be performed.
tatrāpi dvayī vimatiḥ kaiścit preṣaṇātmakatvaṃ śabdasyābhyupagatam liṇādiśabdebhyas tathā tadavagamāt kāryāntarānavagamāt bhāvārthamātrakāryatvapakṣasya cātidaurbalyād vidhir evānuṣṭheya ity arthāt tasya kāryatvam //	(a) The first batch of disciples admits that the suffix lin impels persons to action since they are aware of its impelling force. These disciples also hold that the other function of the suffix lin is not presented to our consciousness. The view that a sentence prescribes the performance of any act enjoined or not is too weak to maintain. Therefore an act which has been enjoined should be observed.
anyais tu kāryatvena niyogapratīteḥarthāt tasya prerakatvam iti saṃśritam /	(b) Someother disciples subscribe to the view that when we understand something as690 our duty we also make out that the scripture orders us to dis- charge it.
kāryam avagataṃ svasiddhaye puruṣaṃ niyuṅkte [mamedaṃ kāryaṃ] ity avagate hi tatsiddhaye puruṣaḥ pravartata iti //	A person engages himself in fulfilling his duty when he knows it to be such since when a man knows that it is his duty he moves for accomplishing it.
apare punaḥ abhinavaṃ vākyārthaṃ udyogaṃ nāma varṇayāṃ babhūvuḥ ity anekaśākhā vipratipattiḥ /	(7) Some other logicians hold that a new enterprise is denoted by a sentence. So, these diffe- rent hypotheses are at variance with one another.
tad atra kiṃ tattvam iti //	Let us see which one is correct.
atraike tāvad āhuḥ vākyārtho nāma pāramārthiko bahir nāsty eva / sa hi padārthebhyo vyatirikto vā syāt avyatirikto vā na vyatiriktaḥ bhedānupalambhāt /	The View that a Sentence Denotes an Idea : Some logicians hold that no real external object is denoted by a sentence since if a real external object is denoted by a sen- tence then is it different from the meanings of its constituent words or not? One cannot say in the affirmative since the difference of the meaning of a sentence from those of its consti- tuent words is grasped by no body.
[gauḥ śuklā ānīyatāṃ] ity atra padagrāme jātiguṇakriyādipadārthavyatirekeṇa ko 'sau vākyārthaḥ sa na darśayituṃ śakyate / avyatireke tu padārthā eva vākyārthaḥ pratyekaṃ vā syāt sāmastyena vā na pratyekaṃ tathā 'navagamāt na hi gaur iti padārtha eva vākyārtho bhavati //	The word 'anīyatām' signifies an act. Is the meaning of a sentence identical with that of each word or with the collective meaning of all words? This problem is to be solved at the outset. Nobody will say that the meaning of a sentence is identical with that of each word since no body grasps the meaning of a sentence in this way since the meaning of the word 'gauḥ' alone cannot constitute that of the above sen- tence.
sāmastyaṃ tu na teṣām asti tad dhi sattayā bhavet pratītyā vā sattayā na sāmastyam aśeṣapadārtharāśer astīti niyataḥ kiś cana vākyārtho 'vadhāryate /	How does the collection take place? Does it occur because the different meanings exist? Or, does the apprehension of their meaning combine them? We cannot say that the meanings of the different words combine together because they exist since all objects which are denoted by words exist but no body comes across a distinct sentence which refers to all of them.
pratītyā tu sāmastyam adhaṭamānam yugapadbhāvitvena jñānānāṃ ekapadārthapratītisamaye padārthāntarapratītyasaṃbhavāt /	When we form the ideasA sentence denotative of an idea of an object the idea of another object is conspicuous by its ab- sence. Thus the simultaneity of two ideas is not possible.
padārthapratityupāyāś ca varṇāḥ /	More- over the letters which constitute each word are the real means to the appearance of the idea of an object corresponding to a word.
te 'pi na yugapadbhāvinaḥ /	These letters do not simultaneously come into being and co-exist.

Moreover, do all the meanings of words which assemble to- gether constitute the meaning of a sentence, being themselves related to one another or not? We cannot say in the negative since a cow, a horse, a man, an elephant and so on are not seen to constitute the meaning of a sentence since they remain unrelated to one another.
saṃsargas tu durupapādaḥ/ sa hy apekṣā gato bhavati /	It is also difficult for one to establish the relation between two objects since the relation between the two objects presupposes their correlation.
na cārtho 'rthāntaram ākāṅkṣati acetanatvāt / buddhīnām api kṣaṇikatvāt anyonyaṃ nākāṅkṣā /	But an object does not refer to another one since they are unconscious. Ideas are also not correlative since they have only momentary exis- tence.
na ca tatkṛitaḥ sambandhaḥ //	They cannot also unite objects with a tie constituted by themselves.
ata eva na saṃsargo vākyārthaḥ /	For this reason a relation cannot constitute the meaning of a sentence.
na hyasau arthānāṃ jñānānāṃ vā yothoktanītyā 'vakalpate //	The objects or their ideas are not mutually related since the reason behind their non-relation has been stated before.
vyavacchedo 'py evam eva nirākāryaḥ /	691 If we follow the above reason then the hypothesis that the negation of the contrary is the meaning of a sentence will also be refuted.
so 'pi hi na jñānānām upapadyate /	Hence, they are not com- petent enough to convey such a judgment as its meaning).
tad uktam [yadi dhriyate gobuddhiḥ śuklabuddhijanikṣaṇe/	In the sentence "A cow is white" if the word 'cow' denotes all sorts of cows viz.
tato 'nyābhyo nivarteta saṃsṛjyetātha vā tayā] iti //	and if the idea of a cow produces that of white then the idea of white can negate the idea of non-white or can relate itself with that of a cow.
na cāpekṣāyāṃ satyām api sambandhaḥ kaścid upalabhyate / yathoktam [apekṣaṇe 'pi sambandho naiva kaścit pratīyate/	Kumarila has also subjected the thesis to the same criticism, Though there is correlation between the two ideas or objects692 yet no relation subsisting between them is grasped by us. A relation is really significant if it is one of the following ones viz.
kāryakāraṇasaṃyogasamavāyādilakṣaṇaḥ //	the causal relation, conjunction, inherence etc.
ekārthavṛttiparāyas tu sambandho 'tiprasajyate] iti // arthānāṃ tu kaścid api bhavan sambandhaḥ śabdair anabhidhīyamānatvāt asatkalpa eva na ca bhedasaṃsargayor vācakaṃ kiñcit padam asti aśravaṇāt /	If it is held that co-existence is one of such relations then it may also be pointed out that it is too wide (Kumārila means to say that as the idea of white co-exists with many other ideas so the said relation will also take place bet- ween the idea of white and any other idea). In some cases, adequate words do not denote the relation which subsists between the meanings of words.
asati ca tadvācani pade na tayoḥ padārthatvam /	Hence, it is no better then non-existent.
apadārthasya ca na vācyārthatvam //	If they are not conveyed by words then they cannot be the meaning of a sentence.
śrute 'pi tadvācini pade sutarām asaṅgatiḥ [gauḥ śukla ānīyatāṃ saṃsargaḥ] iti ko 'rthaḥ /	Does the sentence. "The white cow be brought the relation" convey any sense? Hence the hypothesis that a sen- tence points to external objects as its meaning is absolutely absurd.
tasmāt bāhyasya vākyārthasya sarvaprakāram asaṃbhavāt padārthasarganirbhāsaṃ jñānagātraṃ vākyārthaḥ tenaiva lokavyavahāra iti //	Hence, an idea which appears to be the relation of the external objects may be the meaning of a sentence. The people transact all their worldly business by means of it.
tad idam anupapannam bāhyārthasyānantaram eva vistareṇa parasādhitatvāt / ca saṃsarganirbhāsaṃ jñānaṃ vākyārtho bhavitum arhati /	This is the sum and substance of this hypothesis. The Refutation of the Hypothesis that an [dea is Conveyed by a Sentence: The above hypothesis is not logically tenable since the exis- tence of external objects has been erewhile established.
sthāpayitvā hi bāhyārthaṃ vākyārthacintām upakrantovanto vayam /	An idea which appears to be the relation of external objects cannot be the meaning of a sentence since having established the reality of external objects we have commenced to bestow our considera- tion upon the meaning of a sentence.
ataḥ ko 'vasaro vijñānamāṃtravākyārthatvavarṇanasya //	Now, we have no time to discuss the hypothesis that the meaning of a sentence is nothing but an idea.
na ca padārthavyatirikto nāsti vākyārthaḥ /	The upholders of the above hypothesis say that the meaning of a sentence is not the aggregate of the meanings of its constituent words.
idaṃ tāvad bhavān pṛṣṭo vyācaṣṭām /	Very well, let us put a question to them. We ask them to give an answer.
kiṃ [gauḥ] iti padād yādṛśī pratipattiḥ tādṛśyeva [gauḥ śukla ānīyatām] iti vākyāt uta bhinne ete pratipattī iti //	If one utters the word 'a cow', it produces an idea in our mind. Again if one utters the sen-A sentence denotative of an idea Refuted 693 tence "Bring a white cow," it also produces an awareness in our mind.
tatra tulyatvaṃ tāvat pratipattyor anubhavaviruddham /	But you may say that these two ideas are different.
vailakṣaṇye tu pratītyoḥ viṣayavailakṣaṇyam api balād upanatam asati viṣayabhede pratītibhedānupapatteḥ/	They are not different if their corresponding objects are not different. So, you will be com- pelled to admit that the objects referred to by these two ideas are distinct.
yaś ca tadatirikto viṣayaḥ sa vākyārthaḥ / evaṃ kevalaguṇakriyāpadoccāraṇe 'pi yojanīyam /	Thus, the object conveyed by a sentence is distinct. It constitutes the meaning of a sentence. If a word denoting an attribute or a verb is only uttered along with the above noun i.
tad uktaṃ yad ādhikyaṃ sa vākyārthaḥ iti //	The expert grammarians hold that when the volume of the meanings of a word increases it is called the meaning of a sentence.
saṃsargo 'pi padānāṃ na na pratīyate /	Again, it is not a fact that the relation holding among the meanings of words is not presented to our consciousness.
na hi [gaur aśvaḥ puruṣo hastī] ity asaṃsṛṣṭapadārthapratītivat [gauḥ śukla ānīyatām] iti pratītiḥ /	But when we employ the sentence "let a white cow be brought" the meanings of its constituent words are not presented to our consciousness as unrelated to one another.
yathā ca saṃsargaḥ pratīyate yaś ca pratītyupāyaḥ tat sarvaṃ vistarato nirṇeṣyate /	We shall elaborately discuss later on how a relation presents itself to our consciousness and what is the means of its presentation.
tasmāt bāhya eva vākyārthaḥ //	In other words, its meaning is objective but not subjective.
bāhya eva bhavan na vyavacchedo vākyārthaḥ vidhirūpatvenāvagamāt / saṃsargam antareṇa cānyavyavacchedasyāpi durupapādatvāt /	Though a sentence refers to an extra mental object yet one should not hold that it conveys merely a negative sense in the shape of the negation of the contrary of its predicate since the meaning of the sentence referred to is presented to our consci- ousness as a positive object and the above negative sense pre- supposes the relations holding between the meaning of its con- stituent words.
na hi śuklapadenāsaṃsṛṣṭaḥ gopadārtha kṛṣṇādibhyo vyāvṛtta ity avagamyate //	(Let us now clearly state the above hypothesis and its criticism. The sentence "The cow is white" conveys the sense that the cow is not black.
gośabdāt sarvagavīṣu buddhir upasarpantī padajanitā śuklapadasannidhānāt anyataḥ kṛṣṇāder apasarpatīti vyavacchedo vākyārtha iti cet maivam tatsambandhāvagamapūrvakatvāt taditaravyāvṛtteḥ /	presupposes the presence of whiteness). When the word 'cow' is used it produces an awareness of all cows. If the word 'white' is syntactically connected with the word 'cow' then it excludes the connection of the word 'black' with the word 'cow'. Therefore, you cannot hold that a sentence conveys only the sense of an exclusion.
tatsambandhāvabodhenaiva siddhe vākyasya arthavattve pāścātyaḥ kṛṣṇādivyavacchedāvagamo yadi bhavati bhavatu kāmaṃ na tv asau vākyārtha iti //	When we understand the complete meaning of a sen- tence the exclusion of the contrary of white, viz., the black, etc., may be implied by the same sentence. If such an implied meaning takes place, let it take place. But on account of this implied meaning we cannot hold that a sentence conveys only a negative sense.
tad evaṃ vidhirūpe bāhye ca śabdārthe 'vasthite sati kriyām eva kecid vākyārthaṃ varṇayanti /	Now, some thinkers hold that a sentence points to some- thing which is to be done. They purport to convey the follo- wing idea. The meanings of words constituting a sentence have mutual reference.

The meanings of words are not mutually related if they are not arranged in the relation of the principal and the subordi- nate.
na cākhyātarahitaṃ vākyaṃ kiñcit prayogayogyam / anuccārite tasmin ākāṅkṣāyā anivṛtteḥ /	If a verb does not find a place in the sentence then a sentence cannot be used since a verb being not uttered, the requirement of a listener is not fulfilled.
śrotrākāṅkṣānivṛttaye ca vākyānāṃ loke prayogaḥ /	In cases of worldly transactions in order to satisfy the requirement of a listener a sentence is employed.
lokavac ca vedād apy artho 'vasīyate / ākhyātāc ca pūrvāparībhūrtaḥ sādhyarūpo 'rtho 'vagamyate na siddharūpaḥ /	We also learn that a verb does not communicate the sense of an accomplished fact. In a sentence there are words denoting accomplished facts and a word which signifies an object to be accomplished.
siddhasādhyasamuccāraṇe kasya kiṃtantrateti cintāyāṃ sādhyasiddhaye siddham upāttam iti pratīyate // sādhyaṃ ca sādhyamānatvāt pradhānam avagamyate/	Does a word which stands for an accomplished fact occupy the principal position? Or, does a word which signifies an object to be accomplished occupy the principal position? Having bestowed due delibertion on the matter we learn that accomplished facts are taken as means in order to realise the object to be accomplished.
tasmāt tad eva vākyārthaḥ kriyāto nāparaṃ ca yat //	It is the meaning of a sentence. It is not distinct from the meaning of a verb.
kriyā hi pratīyamānā svaniṣpataye sādhanāny ākṣipati taiś ca yogyaiḥ saṃbandhyate /	Whenever we are aware of an object to be accomplished by us it points to the means which are required for its realisation. An object to be accomplished is directly related to some of these means, i.e., some means are proximate.
tāni ca kaiścit padāntaropāttāni bhavanti / kānicit vākyāntaropanītāni /	Some means are indi- cated by words which do not occur in the sentence. Some means are pointed by some other sentences.
kānicit prakaraṇāntarapāṭhalabhyāni / kānicid ārād upakārakāṇi / kānicit sannipatyopakārakāṇi kānicid antikopanipatitāny api yogyatāvirahāt pariharanti /	Some means are revealed to us by passages occurring in other contexts. Some means render their indirect assistance to realise the object to be accomplished. Some means are abandoned by the object to be accomplished though they stand in close proximity but lack capacity.
kānicid atidūravartāny api yogyāni svasaṃpattyartham āharanti /	Though some means stand in a remote place yet the object to be acco- mplished attracts them since they are capable of bringing it 695696 about.

The word which reveals qualifications for a person wishing to perform an action implies the agent who is required for the performance of an action.
tatra ca na kriyā svaprādhānyam ujjhati /	Thus it makes us understand that an agent has usefulness in his action.
na hi kriyā kartrarthā kartā tu kriyārthaḥ / sa hi tāṃ nirvartayann upalabhyate /	It purports to convey that this person is the agent of this particular action and this action is to be completed by this person.

kim atha punar asau kriyām anutiṣṭhatīti cet śabdaprāmāṇyād eveiti brūmaḥ /	If you ask "Why does a person perform an action?", then our rejoinder is that the sen- tence which enjoins a person to do is regarded by him as the valid source of knowledge.
śabdena hi coditaḥ [tvayedaṃ kartavyam] iti /	One has been ordered by the in- junctive sentence, "One should perform this action".
sa cen niyukto nānutiṣṭhan codanām atikrāmet / śastrapratyayāc ca kriyām anutiṣṭhati /	If a person who has been thus ordered does not perform the prescri- bed action then he will transgress an injunction, i.e., an ob- ligatory duty.

A man who does not covet for the fruit of an action performs an action because he is goaded by the habit of performing actions. This habit strengthens his attitude of indifference towards the worldly objects. This atti- tude being confirmed, he gradually negates the reality of all worldly objects. Thus, he acquires the highest qualification for realising the Absolute.
tad uktam [dravyaguṇasaṃskāreṣu bādariḥ] iti //	The highest qualification, acquired by him, enables him to grasp the summum bonum of life.
etad uktaṃ bhavati dravyādīnām eva kriyāṃ prati śeṣatvam anugamyate na kriyāyā anyaśeṣatvam iti //	In other words, an action is an end in itself but not a means to an end. Thus it is not subsidiary.
atrocyate kuta idaṃ kriyāyāḥ prādhānyam upeyate vastuvṛttena va śabdapratyayamahimnā vā phalasya vastutas tāvat prādhānyam avagamyate/	Why does an action occupy the principal position in a sentence? Does it occupy such a position by its intrinsic nature? Or does it ac- quire the position by verbal authority? If we think over the problem from the realistic point of view then we find the superiority of the fruit of an action.
na sacetāḥ kriyāṃ kāṃcit anutiṣṭhati niṣphalām //	No intelli- gent man undertakes a fruitless action.
vedād guruniyogād vā śāsanād vā mahībhujaḥ/ na vai phalam apaśyantaḥ kriyāṃ vidadhate janāḥ //	Though a person is enjoined by the Vedas or directed by his superiors or commanded by his king to do an action yet he does not betake himself to it when he is not confident of his success.
bālo māṇavako 'py eṣaḥ capeṭāmātrahānaye/ modakādyāptaye vā 'pi karoti guruśāsanam //	A dullard carries out the order of his superiors either in order to avoid a slap or in order to gain a sweet-meat. In other words, a fool indiscreetly undertakes an action either out of fear or out of greed.
athocyate na vastutaḥ prādhānyam ihāśrīyate api tu śabdataḥ /	The Mimamsakas re-examine their criticism and hold that they will not decide the question of superiority from the reali- stic point of view but from the linguistic point of view.

vastuvṛtte rājā jagatāmīśitā pradhānam puruṣas tapasvī tad icchānuvartanena jīvati /	If the actual order of things is taken into consideration then a king occupies the most exalted position, being the ruler of the world. The wretched person who serves him earns his livelihood obeying his will.
śabdas tu puruṣaprādhānyam ācaṣṭe uttarapadārthapradhānatvāt tatpuruṣasyeti /	But if the superiority is decided from the linguistic point of view then the servant occupies the superior position in the compound word.

[svargakāmaḥ] ity api kriyāṃ prati kartur upadeśaḥ /	An agent has been mentioned for the purpose of an action.

But if an action is done and a result is produced in the natural order of things then let the result be produced. Let an agent put forth his energy for the fruition of his action. But the above injunctive sentences do not attach prominence to the fruit of an action.
āha ca [tasmiṃs tu kṛte svayam eva tad bhavati] iti /	The statement that if an action is performed then the result itself follows is significant.
svayam eveti korthaḥ na śabdaḥ phalapāratantryaṃ kriyāyāḥ pratipādayatīti //	What is the significance of the word itself? It purports to convey that an action is not a means to an end, viz., the result of an action.
tad etad ukutaṃ evaṃ varṇyamāne [svargakāmo yajeta] iti svargakāmapadasyānvayo durupapādaḥ //	If they interpret the injunctive sentence "Svargakāmo Yajeta" in the above manner then it will be difficult syntacti- cally to connect the word "Svargakāmaḥ" with the verb 'yajeta'.
nanu kartṛpadam etat / kartā ca kriyārthaḥ kartrarthā kriyety uktam na kartṛpadaṃ svargakāma iti kin tv adhikāripadam etat /	The word in question denotes the subject of the sentence. A subject is a means to an action but not vice versa. The cri- tics point out that the word 'svarga-kāmaḥ' does not stand for the subject.
na hi jātyaiva kaścit svargakāmo nāma kutracit puruṣo 'vagamyate yo 'tra kartṛtvena niyujyeta /	But nobody is known to be desirous of heaven from his very birth so that he may be enga- ged in the action as an agent.
svarge kāmo yasyāsau svargakāmaḥ svarga vā kāmayati svargakāmaḥ /	A man who has a longing for heaven is called 'Svarga-kāmaḥ.' Or, a man who wishes for heaven is called 'Svargakamah'.
ubhayathāpi svargakāmanāviśiṣṭaḥ puruṣas tasmāt padād avagamyate /	The two senses of the above term clearly state that a person who has set his heart upon heaven is Svargakāmaḥ.

Does it render visible or invisible help to the verb?699 Heaten incapable of assisting an action Heaven does not visibly assist the verb : The sentences, viz. "Sandal is heaven," "Damsels, sweet sixteens, are heaven" imply the identity of heaven with subs- tances like Sandal, damsels, etc. Hence the word 'heaven' denotes a substance. Jaimini holds that if substances are related to the object of a verb then they, assisting the object of a verb, are related to the verb.
kāmanā 'pi haraṇāṅgatvādupakāriṇī yat tayā dravyamānetuṃ yatata iti dṛṣṭopakāritvam //	The benefit which such desire renders to an action is visible since a person moves for collecting materials, being induced by such desire.
tac caitad asāram svargaśabdasya dravyavācitvābhāvāt / prītivacanohy eṣa svargaśabdaḥ na dravyavacanaḥ /	The view in question is not sound since the word 'heaven' does not denote a substance since it denotes bliss but not a substance.
tad eva candanaṃ śītātureṇa agrīṣmopahatena vā na svarga iti vyapadiśyate / saivāṅganā viratāyāṃ suratatṛṣi na svarga ityucyate /	The very sandal is not heaven to a person who is afflicted with cold. But it is said to be heaven by him who is oppressed by the heat of summer. The very lady is designated as heaven by an erotic person.
tad evam eṣa svargaśabdaḥ pratītiṃ na vyabhicarati dravyaṃ tu vyabhicarati /	Thus heaven invariably denotes bliss but not a substance.
evam adravyatvāt svargasya na kriyāṅgatvam //	As heaven is not a substance so it is not a means to action.

Such a place is not a means to the said action since nobody can have an access to it and the articles like sour milk etc.

Similarly, desire for heaven will generate merit and through this invisible result help the act of sacrificing. Such an assumption is far- fetched.
pratīteś cānanyārthatvaṃ yuktam / prītyartham anyat nānyarthā prītiḥ /	Heaven is infinite bliss. Bliss is not a means to an end. But everything else is a means to bliss which is an end in itself.
tasmān na yāgāya svargaḥ api tu svargāya yāgaḥ / itthaṃ ca kriyāsādhanānupadeśāt na kartṛsamarpakatvena svargakāmapadaṃ samanveti //	Hence, heaven is not a means to a sacrifice. But a sacri- fice is a means to heaven, Thus as the above sentence does not700 Nyāyamanjari enjoin a means to a sacrifice so the word 'Svarga-kāmaḥ' (one who desires heaven) is not syntactically connected with the verb since it does not communicate an agent.
kathaṃ tarhy asyānvayaḥ ādhikārivācitvena brūmaḥ /	If you ask, "How is it connected with the verb ?" then we say that the word stands for one who enjoys the fruit of an action.
ko 'yam adhikārī nāma karmaṇaḥ svāmī /	Who enjoys the fruit of an action ? He who is entitled to own the result of an action enjoys it.
īsvaravacano hy adhikṛtaśabdaḥ //	In other words, the word 'Svarga-kamaḥ' stands for an agent.
nanu kartaiva karmaṇaḥ svāmī nānyaḥ maivam svāmī san kartā na kartā san svāmīti //	The word 'svāmī' suggests an agent but does not denote a person. In order to be the owner of the result of an act the person must possess capacity.

(This is the contention of the Mimāṁsakas) (The Naiyáyikas reply). A person knows at first that it is his duty and he is capable of discharging it. Thus a person, being aware of the ownership relation, enters into the case relation.
nana tvayāpi kriyākārakasambandhau nāpahnūyata eva jātivādineva vyaktipratītiḥ /	They say "You do not deny existence to the case-relation as the upholders of the thesis that a word denotes only a universal refuse to believe the awareness of an indivi- dual.
sa tu pāścātya iny atra kiṃ pramāṇam uktam atra anupādeyaviśeṣaṇaviśiṣṭasya puṃsaḥ nirdeśād iti /	But how will you prove that the case-relation is subse- quently presented to our consciousness?" Some thinkers give an answer to this question. They hold that the person requires no further qualification, viz.
kārakatvānuguṇaviśeṣaṇayogino hy asau kartṛtayā yogyaḥ saṃbandhaḥ /	A person who possesses the requisite qualifications of an agent viz. capacity etc. becomes the agent of an action.
tadviparyaye tv adhikāritveneti/	For this reason, we hold that a person who possesses the requisite qualifi- cations is the real agent.
tasmād adhikṛtasya kartṛtvam na karturadhikāraḥ // itthaṃ ca svargakāmasyādhikṛtatvaṃ nirvahati /	Mere agency does not confer upon a person the right to enjoy the fruit of an action. Thus a701 Heaven incapable of assisting an action person who desires heaven acquires the said right.
yadi hi tatkarma svargāya syāt svargo me bhogyo bhavet /	If he performs an action with the purpose of attaining heaven then he thinks "Let heaven be my enjoyable object.
katham ahaṃ svargaṃ prāpnuyām ity evaṃ sādhyatvena svargam icchan svargakāma ity ucyate /	How can I attain heaven, and being prompted by this aspiration longs for heaven as his goal. Hence, the performer of a sacrifice is mentioned as one who desires heaven.
yadi ca na svargasādhanaṃ tatkarma tadviruddham evedam āpatati svargaṃ kāmayate yāgaṃ karotīti anyad icchati anyat katotīti hi syāt /	If that action does not lead to heaven then an opposite idea is presented to our mind viz. he desires heaven but performs a sacrifice. He longs for one thing but does another thing.
ataḥ karmaṇaḥ kāmyamānasādhanatām apratipadyamānaḥ svargakāmaḥ tatra naivādhikriyate na cānadhikriyamāṇas tatra saṃbandhyate //	Therefore, if it is not admitted that an action is a means to one's desideratum then a person who desires heaven cannot engage himself in that action. If a person is not entitled to an action then he can in no way be connected with it.

The title does not accrue to a person if the causal relation does not subsist between the act of sacrifice and heaven. Hence, we must admit that heaven is the end and the act of sacrifice is a means to it.
ataś ca kriyāyāḥ phalaṃ prati guṇabhāvān na prādhānyam /	Therefore an action, being a means to its fruit-the end, cannot maintain its principal position in a sentence.

Why do you say that a result is signified by a sentence? Why do you discard the hypothesis that an action is the meaning of a sentence? The reason is that it occupies a subordinate place. This logic applies to the case of a result also.
phalam api puruṣārthatvad apradhānam /	A result is also subordinate to a person since it serves the purpose of a person.

A person endeavours to attain it. But everybody desires all objects as they are to be enjoyed by him. As they are desired by a person so they do not occupy a principal position in a sentence, Jaimini has stated that a result is also not promi- nent since it serves the purpose of a person.
hantatarhi puruṣa eva vākyārtho bhavatu /	Now, the logical conclusion which is suggested by the above discussion is this that a person who performs a sacrifice should be the meaning of a sentence.

[yajamānasaṃmitā audumbarī bhavati] iti tasyāpi tadarthatvam / uktaṃ ca [puruṣaś ca karmārthatvāt] iti // yady evaṃ saṃkaṭe patitāḥ smaḥ /	Thus a person is required to some action. Jaimini also holds that a person is a means to an action.

Which will be the meaning of a sentence ? Our answer to the above problem is as follows. A person is not the meaning of a sentence since there is a divergence of opinion regarding the hypothesis that a person is signified by a verb-not to speak of the hypothesis that a person is signified by a sentence. Why do you say that the agent, i.e.,Hypothesis of an action signified by a sentence Refuted the performer of an action is not signified by a verb? Accor- ding to the rule laid down in Pāņini's, grammar a lakāra (a verb in all its tenses) signifies an agent. Why shall not we hold that an agent is signified by a verb? What is the mean- ing of the term (lakara)? Pänini enjoins that when present tense of a verb is to be indicated lakara assumes the form of lat.
tad etāni kārakasaṃkhyāvibhaktividhāyīni sūtrāṇi ekavākyatayā vyākhyeyāni ekārthaviṣayatvāt /	The sūtras which enjoin cases, number and case-endings should point to syntacti- cal unity as they all refer to one and the same substantive.
eko hi [pacati] ityādiḥ śabdaḥ tair vyakriyate /	If there are two nominative cases of the verb (to cook) then the terminal suffix 'tas'is attached to it.
tad evam eṣa vākyārtho bhavati kartubahutve bahuvacanaṃ jhi iti /	Thus it is clear that the number of the nominative case is conveyed by a verb with a suffix attached to it but not the nominative case.
seyaṃ kartṛsaṃkhyā ''khyātavācyā bhavati na kartā iti kutas tasya vākyārthatvam alaṃ cānayā śastrāntaragarbhayā drāghīyasyā kathayā /	Hence, how is it that the nominative case of a verb, i. c., an agent, is con- veyed by a verb? There is no need of elaborately discussing the subject matter of another science.
puruṣas tāvan na vākyārhtaḥ //	Therefore, a person who per- forms an act is not the meaning of a sentence.
phalam api na vākyārthaḥ siddhāsiddhavikalpānupapatteḥ /	The result pro- duced by a verb, is not the meaning of a sentence since the dilemma that a result is either an accomplished object or not cannot be solved.

The Proof of the Hypothesis that Bhāvanā is the Meaning of a Sentence If an accomplished fact is not a result then a result is to be brought into being.
ata eva hi vākyārthaṃ bhāvanāṃ pratijānate /	Therefore, the Mīmāṁsakas pro- pound the hypothesis that an activity is the meaning of a sen- tence.

Heaven and such other objects which are objects of our desire are other than the sky and the sky-flower.

prakṛtyarthasya bhavateḥ kartā yaḥ svargādiḥ sa eva ṇyantasya tasya karmatāṃ pratioadyate /	A bhāvanā is an activity of the agent towards a course of action which terminates in a result. It sig- nifies that it causes one to come into being.

kriyāvākyārthapakṣaś ca pratikṣiptaḥ ucyate na kriyāmātraṃ bhāvanā /	An answer to this problem is as follows: Any and every action is not a bhāvană, i.e., the activity of an agent.
api ca paridṛśyamānapūrvāparībhūtayajyādibhāvasvarūpātiriktaḥ puruṣavyāpāraḥ pratyayāt pratīyamāno bhāvanā /	Bhāvanā is the activity of an agent. But it is distinct from all visible sacrificial acts which are done in an order of time, viz., prior and posterior. Some of these acts are previously performed and the others are subsequently performed.
yathā ''ha na sā kenacid utpādyā janikā sā na kasyacit /	A bhāvanā (the activity of an agent) is not to be produced by any one of those acts.
kevalaṃ jananī hy eṣā janyasya janakasya ca iti // kriyākārakādivilakṣaṇaiva hi sā śabdāt pratīyata ity arthaḥ //	A verb in the subjunctive mood, viz., 'yajeta' has been illustrated. If we analyse the word 'yajeta'. we find that it consists of two parts, viz., a verb (the root yaj) and a suffix, indicative of subjunctive mood.
nanu ca yajata ity atra prakṛtyartho yāgādiḥ kriyā /	The root 'yaj' signifies the act of sacrifice etc.

na hi bhāvanāvācinīṃ kāṃcid vibhaktiṃ smarati pāṇiniḥ liṅādim iva vidhyādau /	Pāṇini recognises no such in- flection like the suffix indicative of the subjunctive mood as points to the activity of an agent.
tasmān na bhāvanā vākyārthaḥ ucyate bhāvanā 'pi pratīyata evākhyātāt yadi naipuṇyena śābdī pramitir avamṛśyate //	Hence, the activity of an agent does not constitute the meaning of a sentence. An answer to the above question is as follows. If one minutely observes the import of verbal communication then he under- stands that the activity of an agent is also conveyed by a verb.
āstāṃ vidhipadaṃ tāvad vartamānāpadeśinaḥ / śabdāt yajata ityādeḥ bhāvanā na na gamyate //	If we carefully examine the verbs in the present tense then we shall see that from the verbs 'yajate' etc. we unmistakably guess the activity of an agent.

Though706 the act of cooking and such other acts come into being and cease to exist yet the knowledge of the activity of an agent remains unaffected.

The lifting up of a weight and the taking down of a weight are implied by such suffixes. Similarly, an additional meaning viz.
api ca pacati ity ākhyātapadasya padārtho vyācikhyāsito bhavati tadā pākaṃ karoti iti vākyaṃ vyākhyātāraḥ prayuṃjate pacati iti ko 'thaḥ pākaṃ karoti iti pākaśabdeta dvitīyāntena sādhyaṃ dhātvarthaṃ vyācakṣate /	Moreover, when one intends to explain the meaning of a verb viz. 'cooks' he explains it thus :-One does the act of cooking. The act of cooking becomes the object of the transitive verb 'does'. In Sanskrit language the meaning of pacati is expressed in the form 'pākam-karoti'. The word 'paka'—the meaning of the root 'pac' gets the second case-ending.
kartṛvyāpārātmakaṃ pratyayārthaṃ karoti iti padena //	We have already stated that the word 'karoti' stands for such an activity.
kiṃ ca kiṃ karoti devadattaḥ iti pṛṣṭās santaḥ dvaye vaktāro bhavanti karoti pākaṃ iti pacatītivat /	When the question 'what does Devadatta do?' is put, two sorts of answer are given by the two speakers. One says that he does cooking. Another person holds that he cooks.
tad idam ubhayarūpam apy uttaram ekārtham anyathā na tena praṣṭā pratyāyyeta /	These two answers purport to convey the same thing. Otherwise the in- quirer would not have grasped the answer.
tasmāt pākaṃ karotīti padadvayasya yo 'rthaḥ sa evārthaḥ ekasya pacatīti padasya /	Thus the two words "pakaṁ karoti" (does cooking) convey the same meaning as is conveyed by the single word "pacati" (cooks).
atrāpi pacatyarthād anyaḥ karotyarthaḥ pratīyata eva /	The meaning of the root 'to do' is grasped by us as distinct from that of the root 'to cook'.
yo 'sāv anyaḥ karotyarthaḥ sā bhāvanā //	The distinct meaning which is conveyed by the root 'to do' is called 'Bhavana' (i.e. the activity of an agent).
āha na kartṛsaṃkhyādivyatirekeṇa pratyayāt dhātvarthātiriktaṃ vyāpāraṃ pratipadyante /	Some critics join issue with the above thinkers and hold that a terminal inflexion, attached to a root, does not convey an acti- vity which is distinct from the number of an agent etc.
pratipadyeraṃś cet karotīty ato 'pi śabdāt pratipadyeran /	If a distinct activity had been grasped then the verb 'karoti' (does) would have conveyed it.

yaś ca pākaṃ karotīti vyavahāro vibhāgataḥ /	If one uses two words viz.
sa eva samudāyena proktaḥ pacatinā yathā // tathā kāryaṃ karotīti pratītir nāsti laukikī / pratyayārthaḥ korotyarthe pacatyādau tu vartate //	'päkam karoti' then the sense which is conveyed by the inflexion attached to the first 'kr' is different from that conveyed by the inflexion attached to the second (kr). But if we use the word 'pacati' then the inflexion attached to the root 'pac' conveys the same sense as is denoted by the inflexion attached to the first (kṛ).
kartṛsaṃkhyāpratītau ca na vivādo 'sti kasyacit /	Nobody disputes that the number of an agent and such other things are expressed by these inflexions.
tāvatā nihnavaḥ kāryo na tu vyāpārasaṃvidaḥ //	Thereby we should not deny the presentation of an activity as noted above.
karotītyādiśabdebhyaś ca yathā na bhavitavyaviśiṣṭebhyaḥ tatpratītir iṣyate na tathā sarvebhyaḥ //	The activity which is conveyed by 'karoti' cannot be somehow communicated by any other word. Words which denote distinct verbs only convey also such an activity. All words do not com- municate it.
ke punas te viśiṣṭāḥ śabdāḥ ye bhāvānām abhidadhati ucyate bhāvārthaḥ karmaśabdā ye tebhyo gamyeta bhāvanā /	Which are the distinct words pointing to such an activity? Oh yes, there are such words as we shall now mention. All transitive verbs, having terminal inflexions, point to the activity of an agent.
yajetety evamādibhyaḥ sa evārtho vidhīyate //	The verbs like yajeta etc., having proper inflexions attached to them, indicate the said activity.
[bhavanti kecit bhāvārthāḥ na karmaśabdāḥ] yathā [bhāvaḥ] [bhavanaṃ] [bhūti] iti /	The resulting words denote existence or being but not an activity. There are some words which denote rites but not verbs.
bhavanti kecit karmaśabdāḥ na bhāvārthāḥ yathā śyenaikatrikādayaḥ karmanāmadheyatayā prāk samarthitāḥ /	The words like Śyena Yaga etc. exemplify them. The words like Śyena etc. are proper names of some Vedic rites. This point has been proved before.

These terminal in- flexions having synthetic character, indicate the actual mood of a verb viz., the subjunctive mood etc. Verbs, having been employed in proper forms, express the activity of an agent.
tad uktaṃ [yajyādyarthaś cāto 'vagamyate bhāvayed iti ca] iti //	We suggest two corrections here, viz.708 Nyāyamañjari bhävayet itivat and nănuraktena.

Therefore the distinct words such as yajati etc. communicate the activity of a person known as bhāvanā which is to be brought into being. Thus the existence of bhāvanā is proved.
kriyāviśeṣa evāyaṃ vyāpāro jñātur āntaraḥ / spandātmakabahirbhūtakriyākṣaṇavicakṣaṇaḥ //	Some thinkers hold that bhāvanā is a distinct type of activity and is an internal activity of the soul. It is distinct from the outer motion known as spanda (vibration).
ity evaṃ kecit // puruṣasya prayatno vā bhāvanety abhidhīyate /	Some other thinkers hold that bhāvanā is conation which be- longs to the soul.

'One should make gifts', 'One should pour libation' etc. a consecutive series of non-specified activities is presented to our consciousness.

The defender of the views may also counterargue that a bhāvanā should not also be denoted by a suffix because verbs like 'bhavati' etc.
tad alam anena nirdhāraṇaprayatneta /	(We get the verb 'bhavati' by attaching a terminal inflexion to the root bhū.).
sarvathā dhātor vā pratyayād vā bhāvanā 'vagamyata iti siddham // sā dhātoḥ pratyayād vā 'pi bhāvanā 'vagatā satī /	It is our confirmed opinion that a bhāvanā is conveyed either by a root or by a suffix. A Bhāvanā Consists of three Factors: A bhavana is communicated to us either by a root or by a suffix.
apekṣate 'śatritayaṃ kiṃ kena katham ity adaḥ //	But it relates to three subjects of urgency (1) viz.
[bhāvayet] ity avagate nūnam apekṣātrayaṃ bhavati kiṃ bhāvayet kena bhāvayet katham bhāvayet iti //	what is to be achieved (2) by which means it is to be achieved, and (3) how is it to be realised. The first subject of inquiry is what is to be achived.
tatra kim ity apekṣā svargakāmapadena pūryate kiṃ bhāvayet [svargaṃ] iti //	This inquiry is answered by word 'svarga- kāmaḥ' (one desirous of heaven). What is to be achieved ? 'Heaven' is our answer.
nanu [svargakāmaḥ] iti puruṣanirdeśo 'yaṃ na phalanirdeśaḥ satyam svargaparas tv ayaṃ nirdeśaḥ /	The word 'svarga-kamah' points to an agent but not to an end. Therefore, the above solution does not satisfy us.
uktaṃ hi niratiśayaprītivacanaḥ svargaśabdaḥ /	It is a truism that the said word points to an agent. But710 here the statement purports to convey heaven.
prītiś ca yān nārthety apy uktam /	It is an end in itself but not a means to an end.
sādhyatvena ca svargaḥ kāmyata iti sa eva hi kim ity aṃśe nipatati [svargaṃ bhāvayet] iti / [svargaṃ kāmyate] iti ca vyutpattau nispaṣṭam eva tasya sādhyatvam /	Heaven is desired as an object to be achieved. Hence it falls on the side of a desirable object. We mean to say that heaven is to be achieved. If the word 'svarga-kāmaḥ' literally signifies one who desires heaven then it is clear that heaven is to be achieved.
bahubrīhāv api tasyaiva sādhyatvaṃ vidhivṛttaparyālocanayā 'vadhāryate // evaṃ [svargaṃ bhāvayet] ity avagamyate [kena bhāvayet] ity apekṣāyāṃ yāgeneti sambadhyate //	If one admits that the compound word 'Svarga- kāmaḥ' is an example of the Bahuvrihi compound then it points to the fact that heaven is to be achieved. If we carefully examine the force of an injunction then we see that an injunction points to the above conclusion.
nanu [yāgena] iti na śrūyate kin tu [yajeta] iti /	no word such as yägena is given in the injunctive sentence.
tac cākhyātapadaṃ prakṛtipratyayātmakasamudāyarūpam / tatra ḍipratyayasya bhāvanā vācyety uktam /	(1) the root and (2) a terminal inflexion. It is said that the terminal inflexion in the subjunctive mood denotes a bhavana (the mental activity of an agent).
[yaj] iti dhātumātram avaśiṣṭaṃ /	Now, the remaining element is the bare root.
tasya kṛdantasya tṛtīyāntasya yāgeneti yo 'rthaḥ sa katham ekākinā tena pratyāyyeta ucyate bhāvanā cet pratyarārtha iti soḍhamāyuṣmatā yāgenety abhisambandhaḥ soḍhavya eva /	Now if a kṛt-suffix is attached to this root then the word 'yaga' is framed. If the third-case-ending is joined to this word then we get the word 'yagena'. Now, the question is "How can the bare root 'yaj' convey the sense of inflexional word 'yàgena' ?" The problem is solved thus:- Oh longlived one: You do not take an exception to the hypothesis that a bhavana is denoted by a suffix or an inflexion.
yo hi tasyāṃ yathā sambaddhuṃ yogyaḥ tamasau tathā pratyeṣyati nānyatheti karaṇākāṅkṣāparipūraṇena sambandhayogyo yajir iti tathaivaiṣa bhāvanayā 'bhisambadhyate //	If its requirements were not fulfilled then it would not have referred to a yaga. If the root 'yaj' fulfills the requirement of an instrument then it becomes capable of being related to a bhāvană. In this manner the root ‘yaj' is related to a bhāvanā.
aprātipadikatvād dhi tṛtīyā tatra mā sma bhūt /	The meaning of the root 'yaj' does not convey the sense of the third-case ending.
śabdasāmarthyalabhyā tu nūnaṃ kāraṇatā yajeḥ //	But owing to the force of expression belonging to a word the root 'yaj' conveys a yaga as an instru- mental case.
kasya punaś śabdasya sāmarthyam etat bhāvanāvācina iti brūmaḥ tṛtīyayaiva kāraṇatvam abhidhānīyam iti neyaṃ rājājñā /	There is no royal mandate to the effect that the instrumentality of an object is conveyed only by the direct mention of the third case-ending. A subjective inflexion denot- ing a bhãvană suggests the sense of the third case-ending.
tatas tadavagates tu tathā 'bhyupagamyate /	We along with the critics accept the above view.
evam ihāpi [svargakāmo yajeta] iti tathā 'vagatir bhavantī kim iti na mṛṣyate ākhyātāt sādhyatā yā ca dhātvarthasyāvagamyate /	Therefore, why do not the critics accept the view that in the sentence "one who is desirous of heaven should sacrifice" heaven is the object to be achieved.
dviṭīyā śrūyate tatra kiṃ vā tadabhidhāyinī nanu evaṃ tarhi dhārvarthasya sādhyatā 'vagateḥ kim ity aṃśe yajinā patitavyam [kiṃ bhāvayet] [yāgam] /	If the above solution is final then the meaning of the root is identical with the object which is to be accomplished. In that case, the root 'yaj' will answer the question what is to be achieved? It should fall on the side of what.
kenety apekṣite vākyāntarasamarpitaṃ [brīhibhiḥ] ityādi sambadhyatam na punar yajeḥ sādhyarūpavyāpārābhidhayipratyayopasarjanībhūtakarmatāṃ atipratyāsannām anāruhya dūravartinīṃ karaṇatām adhiroḍhum arhati ucyate syād etad evaṃ yadi hi [svargakāmaḥ] iti na śrūyate /	If it does not concern itself with an object and if it is taken to relate itself with an instrumental cause which is remote then the activity does follow the proper channel of direction. Therefore the said activity should not be connected with an instrumental cause. An answer to the above objection is as follows. The synta- ctical relation as suggested by the objector would have been accepted if the word 'svarga-kamah' had not been given in712 Nyāyamañjari the injunctive sentence.
tasmiṃs tu śrute naivaṃ bhavitum arhati /	Therefore, the root 'yaj' does not signify an object to be achi- eved.
kutaḥ svargādisādhyasaṃbandhād alabdhvā sādhyatā 'nvayam / yajis tadānuguṇyena karaṇāṃśe 'vatiṣṭhate //	But it signifies an instrumental cause which helps the coming into being of an object. The reason behind our state- ment is this. Heaven is an object of desire.
svargasya hi kāmyamānatvena prītyātmakatvena cānanyārthatvāt sādhyatāyāṃ yogyatvāt kim ity aṃśopanipāte siddhe tatrālabdhaniveśo yajiḥ tadapekṣitāṃ karaṇatām eva yogyatvād avalambate //	As the world 'heaven' conveys no other sense so it, being noth- ing but pleasure in itself, is worthy of being achieved. When we long for an object to be achieved heaven alone attracts attention as an object longed for. So a sacrifice, conveyed by the root 'yaj', does not represent itself as such an object.
sāmānādhikaraṇyaṃ ca jyotiṣṭomādibhiḥ padaiḥ /	The instrumental cause in question is a sacrifice.
evaṃ saty upapadyeta karaṇatvānuvādibhiḥ //	Thus, a sacri- fice has been determined as an instrumental cause.
karmanāmadheyatvaṃ ca jyotiṣṭomādīnāṃ śabdānām uktam //	A particular sacrifice, Jyotiştoma by name has been again mentioned as an instrumental cause.
nanu sādhyatvapakṣasākṣitām api karmanāmadheyāni bhajante [agnihotraṃ juhoti] iti naiṣa doṣaḥ sādhya eva bhavan bhāvārthaḥ sādhanatām avalambate / tatrāpi hi svargabhāvanāyām agnihotrākhyo homaḥ karaṇam eva anyathā svargakāmapadānanvayaprasaṅgāt ity uktam /	"Agnihotram juhoti (one should perform the Agnihotra homa)." The example, cited by the objector, does not affect our hypothesis. Though the meaning of the root superficially appears to be the object to be accomplished yet a deep insight into the construction of the sentence reveals that the said homa, called Agnihotra, is really an instrumental case; otherwise the compound word 'Savarga- Kāmaḥ' will have no syntactical relation in the sentence.
nāmadheyapadaṃ tu karmatām anuvadati kiñcit karaṇatām [agnihotraṃ] ityādi [jyotiṣṭomena] iti /	In some other Vedic sentences the names of sacr- ifices are used as an instrumental case e.g. 'Jyotiştomena yajati' cic.
tasmāt yajeḥ karaṇatvenaivānvaya iti siddham /	Therefore ‘yaji' should be syntactically related as an ins- trumental case.
yat tu pratyāsannatvāt sādhyāṃśopanipātitety ucyate tad ayuktam yogyatvavirodhinī pratyāsattiḥ saṃbandhakāraṇam na tadviparitā /	When such fitness for being mutually related is logically ascer- tained, ground for mutual relation to be held between the two terms is prepared. In the absence of such fitness, mutual relation between two terms cannot take place.
yogyatvaṃ ca svargasyaiva sādhyatāyāṃ yajeś ca karaṇatāyām ity uktam //	Heaven is a fit object to be achieved and a sacrifice which is denoted by the root 'yaj' is fit to be its instrumental cause.
evaṃ [yāgena bhāvayet] ity avagate [katham] ity apekṣāyāṃ itikartavyatā tadvākyapāṭhitā vākyāntaraniveditā vā sambadhyate // tadvakyopāttā tāvat yathā [etasyaiva revatīṣu varavantīyam agniṣṭoma sāma kṛtvā paśukāmo hy etena yajeta] iti //	Now, he connects the system of means mentioned in the injunctive sentence and in other sentences with the sacrifice in question. The means mentioned in the sentence enjoining a sacrifice is that one who performs a sacrifice with a view to acquire animals should sing a song consisting of the Revati Rks set to the tune Väravantiya-a song sung in the Agnişțoma sacrifice.
vākyāntarooāttā [brīhīn avahanti] [taṇḍulān pinaṣṭi] [smidho yajati] [bahir yajati] [tanūnapātaṃ yajati] iti //	The means mentioned in other sentences are as follows:- One should unhusk paddy with pestle and mortar', One should grind rice'. One should offer twigs to fire and 'One should worship fire'.
itikartavyatā hīṣṭā dṛṣṭāḍṛṣṭaprayojanā /	Our conclusive view is that these means possess visible and invisible efficacy.
prāyaḥ sarvatra bhāvārthe katham aṃśopapādinī //	They almost in every case give an answer to the question 'how'.
dṛṣṭopakāradvāreṇa sambaddhā peṣaṇādikā /	When a visible benefit is made one is to think such acts as the act of pounding etc.
itikartavyatā jñeyā sannipatyopakāriṇī //	This act has a direct influence upon the meaning of the root i.e. the rite to be performed.
bhāvārtham anugṛhṇāti yā tv adṛṣṭena vartmanā / samidādyātmakām āhuḥ tām ārād upakāriṇīm //	(If one makes an offering of twigs to fire then he gets benefit in the next world. Hence, it renders an indirect service to the sacrificer.
evam aṃśatrayāśleṣalabdhānuṣṭhānayogyatām /	But if we do not pound rice then we cannot prepare cakes from rice.
bhāvanā īdṛśīṃ prāpya vṛttir vidhiniṣedhayoḥ //	If a bhāvanā takes place then an injunction and a prohibition become fruitful.
[darśapūrṇamāsābhyaṃ yajeta svargakāmaḥ] [jyotiṣṭomena svargakāmo yajeta] ity atra anantaroktarītyā eṣa vākyārtho jātaḥ darśapūrṇamāsena yāgena svargaṃ bhāvayet anayā 'gnyādhānādikayetikartavyatayeti //	(1) ‘One who desires heaven should perform Darśa and Paurņamāsa sacrifices' and (2) 'One who longs for heaven should perform Jyotistoma sacrifice. These two injunctive sentences are to be interpreted in the light of the principle laid down before. The meaning of the first entence is this that one is to achieve heavenly bliss by means of Darśa and Paurņamāsa sacrifices and he shall have recourse to the subsidiary actions such as the establishing of sacred fire, etc.
kim arthaṃ punar vidhir āśrīyate vartamānāpadeśiṣv apy ākhyāteṣu bhāvanā tīyata iti darśitavān bhavān /	If this is your hypothesis why do you think that an injunction is inevitably necessary? You have said that when verbs are used in the present tense they signify the activity of an agent.
ataḥ kiṃ vidhinā tasya hy īścayaṇaṃ svargayāgayoḥ sādhyasādhanabhāvabodhanāya pravṛttinivṛttiliddhaye vā sādhyasādhanasambandhas tāvat ākāṅkṣāsannidhiyogyatāparyālocanayā vartamānāpadeśino 'py ākhyātāt bhāvanāvagame sati bhavaty evāntareṇāpi vidhim // pravṛttir api puruṣecchānibandhanā svargasya sādhyatve yāgasya sādhanatve 'vadhārite yaḥ svargam icchet sa tatsiddhaye pravartetaiva /	Then why do you assume a verb in the subjunctive mood ? Now you may contend that 'We assume an injunction i.e. a verb in the subjunctive mood either in order to demons- trate the causal relation holding between a sacrifice and heaven or in order to persuade one to undertake an action or to dissuade him from doing it. But due consideration being given to requirement, fitness and proximity though a verb is used in the present tense yet it pointing to the activity of an agent throws light on the causal relation subsisting between the act ofsacri- fice and heaven even without the aid of an injunction. Now the upholder of the above hypothesis may contend that assum- ption of an injunction is necessary because it supplies us with the impelling force i.e.
yas tu necchet tasya vidhir api kiṃ kuryāt na hy apravartamānasya puṃsaḥ vidhir gale pāśaṃ nidadhātiḥ rajvā vā bāhū vadhnāti /	How does an injunction help him in any way? An injunction can neitherCharacter of an Injunction fetter the legs of an unwilling person with an iron chain nor tie down the hands of such a person with a piece of rope.
niṣedhādhikāre 'pi surāpānabrāhmaṇahananādeḥ pratyavāyasādhanatvāvadhāraṇāt tatparijihīrṣayā nivṛttir bhavati na vidhitaḥ /	A person desires to avoid the sphere of prohibition which includes the drinking of wine, the killing of a Brahman etc. because he knows these acts to be evil ones and desists from committing them.
yas tu pratyavāyān na bibheti sa vidhāv api śrute na nivartata eveti /	Hence neither an injunction impels one to undertake an action nor prohibition prompts him to retard from an action.
tasmāt pravṛttinivṛttyor na kāraṇaṃ vidhir iti tadartham api tadāśrayaṇam asāṃpratam //	Therefore, it is illogical to assume the hypothesis of an injunction or that of a prohibition for the purpose of movement or otherwise.
nanu cāhuḥ vidher lakṣaṇam etāvad apravṛttapravartanam / atiprasaṅgadoṣeṇa nājñātajñāpanaṃ vidhiḥ //	715 The determination of the character of an injunction (vidhi) We do not know what is the definition of an injunction (vidhi).
bāḍhaṃ śruto 'yaṃ ślokaḥ / kin tu ko 'sāv apravṛttapravartaka iti na jānīmaḥ pravartakasvarūpe hi saṃśerate pravādukā iti //	Some thinkers say, 'An injunction causes a person to move-a person who has not moved but does not reveal what remains unknown since the second definition is too wide." Yes, we have heard the verse which contains the definition of an injunction but fails to ascertain what is exactly the mover of the unmoved.

Or, is the sense of the suffix, presented to our conscious- ness, a mover? Or, does the operation of the awareness of the sense of the suffix give us an impetus? Or, is the result of an action a mover? Or, is the ascertainment of an exact means to the desired goal an impeller? Or, is an attachment for the desired goal a motiff? As there are so many rival hypotheses on the point at issue so the true character of a mover is not determined.

If the sentence is not used in the subjunctive716 mood then the verb 'yajeta' cannot syntactically relate itself with heaven as its object since heaven occupies a subordinate place in the sentence, being the first member of the compound word 'svarga-kamah' and is very remote from the suffix which stands for the actual verb.
kathaṃ punar vidhir apy amuṃ sādhyasādhanabhāvaṃ bodhayati itthaṃ bodhayati sa hi sapratyayapravartakasvabhāvaḥ /	How does an injunction indicate the relation of a means to an end? It reveals the relation in this way. A suffix represen- ting the subjunctive mood, normally induces a man who has implicit confidence in the result of a rite to undertake it.
na cāpuruṣārtharūpe vyāpāre puruṣaḥ prayatnaśatapreryamāṇo 'pi sapratyayaḥ pravartate /	When a person listens to an injunction which commands him to pursue non-human end, his interest flags since he has no regard for the ideal.

evaṃ hy avabodhayato 'sya pravartakatvaṃ nirvahati //	The persuasive force of an injunction is demonstrated as it throws light on the end and its means.
yat tu darśate 'pi svargādau phale na pravartate cet puruṣaḥ kiṃ vidhiḥ kuryād iti tad apy uktam na hi vāyvādivat puruṣasya pravartako vidhiḥ /	An exception has been taken to the above hypothesis with the remark, 'If a person does not move to undertake a Vedic rite though an injunction points to heaven as the end of human life then how can an injunction exercise its persuasive force? Such an objection is baseless.

vidhis tu sapratyayasyaiva pravartakaḥ / sapratyayasya caitavat pravartanaṃ yat pravartito 'ham iti jñānajananam /	But an injunction only induces one who is endowed with consciousness. The inducement of a conscious person by an injunction makes him feel that he has been led to an action by the injunction.

But an injunction has done its duty because it has stimulated the listener to the effect that he has been inspired by it.
anyo hi pravartanāvagamaḥ anyaś ca bāhyo vyāpāraḥ //	The awareness of inspiration is onething and the volitional reaction in the external world is another thing.
evaṃ vidhivaśād eva sādhyasādhanabhāvadhīḥ /	717 An injunction is at the root of the knowledge of the causal relations holding between a sacrifice and the goal of a person.

[yajeta] iti preraṇā pratīyamānā sādhyasādhanasambandham anavabodhayati vidhau na nirvahatīti tatkṛtas tadavabodha ucyate / niṣedhe ca [na hanyāt] iti niṣedhyamānasya bhāvārthasyānarthatām anavabodhayan vidhiḥ na rāgataḥ pravartamānaṃ pumāṃsaṃ niroddhum utsahata iti vidheyaniṣedhye 'pi tasyaiva vyāpāra ity avaśyāśrayaṇīyo vidhiḥ //	If one listening to an injunctive sentence 'One should sacrifice', feels the inspiration but does not comprehend the causal relation indicated above then the injunction does not become complete in itself. For this reason, it is said that the said causal relation is hinted at by the awareness of inspiration. In case of prohibí- tion on listening to a prohibition that none should kill a person he is not prevented from perpetrating an evil deed, however prohibited it may be, unless and until he realises that the said act is intrinsically evil.
yaś caiṣa paryanuyogaḥ kim arthaṃ vidhir āśrita iti sa khalu saralamatikṛta iva lakṣyate /	The question 'Why has an injunction been resorted to ?' appears to us to be similar to that raised by Simple Simon.
na hi vayam adyakṛtavidhim āśrayema jahīmo vā /	We do neither follow injunctions nor avoid prohibitions of the modern age.
pratipattāro hi vayaṃ vedasya na kartāraḥ /	We are not the authors of the Vedas. But we simply learn them.
tatra ca savidhikāni [yajeta svargakāmaḥ] iti prabhṛtīni śrūyate /	We learn from the Vedas the sentence in the subjunctive mood that one who is desirous of heaven should sacrifice etc.
svargaḥ sādhyaḥ yāgaḥ sādhanam iti /	The well-defined meaning of such an injunction is that heaven is an end to be achieved and a sacrifice is a means to that end.
sa cāyaṃ vidhisāmarthyalabhya iti yuktaṃ vidher āśrayaṇam //	It is conveyed to us by the suggestive power of an injunction. Therefore we should have recourse to an injunction.
yat tu pravartakasvarūpāniścayād vidher aniścaya iti tatrāpy ucyate phalaṃ tāvan na pravartakaṃ siddhyasiddhivikalpānupapatteḥ / siddhasya phalasyāpravartakatvaṃ siddhatvād eva /	The definition of motif It has been objected that an injunction is hard to grasp because springs of action have not been determined. An answer to this objection is as follows. The result of an action cannot be a motive since the result of an action is open to a puzzlingNyayamanjari dilemma, viz.
na hi yat yasyāsti sa tadarthaṃ yatate /	it is either a pre-existent object or a non-existent one.
nāpy asiddhasya kharaviṣāṇaprakhyasya phalasya pravartakatvaṃ yuktam adṛṣṭatvāt //	If a result already exists then nobody tries to bring it about. Again, if a result is non-existent then it is unreal like the horns of a hare.
atha kāmanāviṣayīkṛtaṃ phalaṃ pravartakm iṣyate seyaṃ kāmanaiva pravartakā bhavati na phalam /	If you say that a result which is desired is a motive then it may be as well said that the very desire constitutes the motive of an action but not the result.
etad api na peśalam / upajātapravṛddhatararāgasyāpi kāmyamanopāyaparicchedam antereṇa pravṛttyanupapatteḥ na hi svargakāmaḥ sāṃgrahiṇīm anutiṣṭhati /	Our desire for obtaining a result may be excessive. But if the means to an end is not determined then nobody can reasonably undertake an action. A man who desires heaven does not simply make a show of an action in order to attract a large number of audience.
tadvaraṃ śreyaśādhanatvaṃ pravartakam /	The exact means to the real good should be his spring of action.
loke 'pi caivam eva vyavahāyo dṛśyate /	The people also behave in this fashion when they transact worldly matters.
harītakyādīnām ārogyasādhanatāṃ vaidyācāryacodanāto 'vagatya tadupayogādā vāturajanaḥ pravartate /	They learn from the medical treatises written by the great physicians that the myrobalan fruit remedies a few diseases. When they fall a victim to these diseases they use it.
tṛptisādhanatāmodanasya manyamānaḥ tadbhakṣaṇāya bubhukṣitaḥ pravartate iti śreyaśādhanatvam eva pravartakam //	Considering that food appeases hunger hungry person sets to take food. Therefore what is conducive to the well-being of a person is his motif.
etad api na caturasram śreyaśādhanatvaṃ hy anavagatam avagataṃ vā pravartakaṃ bhavet nānavagatam abyutpannasya pravṛtter adarśanāt /	The above hypothesis is not sound. Does a means to the well- being stimulate one's activity, being itself known or unknown? A means which is not known as such does not stir our activity.
yo hi harītakīnāmārogyahetutāṃ na kutaścid adhigatavān nāsau tadarthy api tām upayuṅkte /	If a person does not learn the medicinal properties of a my- robalan fruit from any source whatsoever, then he, being ill, cannot use it as a remedy.
tasmāt tadbidhahetuḥ pravartakaḥ /	Therefore source of the knowledge of a means is really a mover.

When the means and the end are tangible we know them in their true colour by the joint method of agreement and difference. When the end is invisible the means to this end is learnt only from the verbal authority.
ata eva śabdo 'pi na svarūpamātreṇa pravartakaḥ vāyvāditulyatvaprasaṅgāt /	Therefore, an authoritative word excites our inclina- tion for a work. Such a word by itself (i. c.
yadi hi pavana iva piśāca iva kunṛpa iva śabdaḥ pravartako bhavet anavagataśabdārhasambandho 'pi śravaṇaparavaśaḥ pravarteta na caivam asti /	If it had done so then it would have behaved like the wind etc. If a word, being itself not properly grasped, makes us move as the wind, or a demon or a bad king docs, then a man should undertake a work whenever he hears a word but does not understand its sense.
tasmād aryapratītim upajanayataḥ śabdasya pravartakam //	For this reason, a word impels to action when its sense is thoroughly grasped.
na ca nāma padapratītau vartamānāpadeśakākhyātāt padārthapratītau ca satyāṃ sapratyayo 'pravartamānaḥ kaścit dṛśyata iti liṅādir eva śabdaḥ pravartakābhidhānadvāreṇa pravartako bhavitum arhati /	Inflexions 718Types of Bhavanā indicative of subjunctive mood, cannot impel a person to under- take a work simply revealing the motif of an action.
śabdasya ca jñāpakatvāt cakṣurādi kārakavailakṣaṇye saty api pratītijanmani karaṇatvam aparihāryam /	A word is distinct from other sense-organs the eyes etc. since it com- municates its meaning. In spite of this distinction it is the in- strumental cause of the knowledge of its meaning which it conveys.
karaṇaṃ ca kārakaṃ ca na nirvyāpāraṃ svakāryanirvṛttikṣamam iti vyāpāras tasyāvaśyaṃbhāvī /	An instrumental cause is such as does something. A cause cannot produce its effect if it does not operate. It must be operative.
liṅādeś ca śabdasya na pratītijanmamātre vyāpāraḥ kin tu puruṣapravṛttāv api tathā 'vagamāt /	The inflexion, indicative of the subjunctive mood, does not merely effectuate consciousness but also gives an impu- Ise to work.
liṅā arthāvagame sati pravṛttir dṛśyata iti tatrāpi liṅvyāpāraḥ prabhavati /	When one makes out the sense of lin (an inflexion, indicative of the subjunctive mood) he is seen to undertake a work.
sa cāyaṃ liṅādivyāpāraḥ śabdabhāvanānāmadheyo vidhir ity ucyate /	The operation of lin is responsible for this movement. The operation of lin is called Sābda-bhāvanā.
sa eva pravartakaḥ //	It denotes an injunction i. e.
iha hi liṅādiyukteṣu vākyeṣu dve bhāvane pratīyate śabdabhāvanā arthabhāvanā ceti //	719 The Two Types of Bhavana Sentences, used in the subjunctive mood, communicate two kinds of bhāvanās viz.
tatra arthabhāvanā tāvat dhātvarthātiriktaprayojakavyāpārātmakā darśataiva /	Of these two Ärthabhāvanā is the activity of the agent which causes something to come into being but not denoted by the un- inflected verb i. e. by the basic root.
up bhavanakriyākartṛviṣayaḥ prayojakavyāpāraḥ puruṣasthaḥ yatra bhavanakriyāyāḥ kartā svargādiḥ karmatām āpadyate so 'rhtabhāvanāśabdenocyate /	Something comes into being. The activity of an agent is directed towards it. It belongs to an agent. When heaven, the nominative case of the verb 'to come into being', becomes the objective case of the verb, belonging to the sacrificer, the process, denoted by the second verb, is called "Arthabhāvanā".
vyākhyātaś cāsau //	It has been already explained.
yas tu śabdagataḥ prayojakavyāpāraḥ yatra puruṣapravṛttiḥ sādhyatāṃ pratipadyate sā śabdabhāvanā /	The process or operation which belongs to a word or to its consti- tuent element and induces a person to undertake a sacrifice is call- ed 'Sabda-bhāvanā'.
tathā hy uktam [abhidhāṃ bhāvanām āhur anyām eva liṅādayaḥ] iti //	This view has been expressed in the Tantra- vårttika by Kumārila.
liṅantaśabdaśravaṇe hi yathā yajyādyavacchinnaṃ svavyāpāraṃ puruṣo 'dhigacchati tathā [tadanuṣṭhāne prerito 'ham] ity api pratipadyate / tenānuṣṭheyārthapratipādana iva preraṇāyām api śabdasya sāmarthyāt bhāvanādvayapratipādakaṃ liṅādiyuktaṃ vākyam iṣyate /	When one listens to a sentence containing the verb 'sacrifice' in the subjunctive mood (i.e. one should sacrifice) he makes out its two meanings (1) that it is his duty to perform the sacri- fice and (2) that he has been induced to do it. Hence as the suffix or the inflexion, indicative of the subjunctive mood, com-Nyayamanjari municates one's own obligatory duty to be discharged so it expresses an inducement to discharge it.
tataḥ puruṣavyāpāraś cārthabhāvanā śabdabhāvanāśabdenābhidhīyate / anavagatā ca satī kāryāṅgam iti śabdena sā 'bhidhīyate 'pi /	Arthabhāvana and Sabda-bhāvanā. 720 Therefore, the activity of an agent towards a course of action is called Arthabhāvanā. The operation of a word is also known as Sabdabhāvana.
taduktaṃ [abhidhatte karoti ca] iti //	These two bhavanās are presented to our consciousness.
nanu śabdabhāvanā 'pi bhāvanātmatvād arthabhāvanāvad aṃśatrayam apakṣata eveti tad asyā darśayitavyam ucyate bhāvyāṃśe tāvad asyāḥ puruṣapravṛttirūpanipatīti uktam eva / puruṣapreraṇātmako hi vidhiḥ śabdabhāvaneti tatsādhyā puruṣapravṛttir eva tatra bhāvyatāṃ pratipadyate /	As the operation belongs to a word so it is called Šābda-bhāvanā. If the operation which belongs to a word remains unapprehended then it does not assist the communi- cation of sense. Hence, this bhāvanā is denoted by a word. Kumărila has said to this effect that the Vedic lin denotes Śābda- bhavana by its primary denotative force and assists to communi- cate the meaning of a Vedic sentence in the subjunctive mood.
karaṇāṃśe tu tasyāḥ niyojyaviṣayasamarpakapadavyāpāro niviśate /	the end is to be realised; (2) the instrument by which the end is accomplished; and (3) the manner or process in which the action is performed.
yathā hi yajyādinā svargādir bhāvyaḥ saṃpadyata ity arthabhāvanāyām asau tatkaraṇatām avalambate /	The three elements of Sabda-bhâvanā are as follows: (1) The inclination of a listener for an obligatory duty falls under the end of Sabda bhāvanā.
evam i hāpi niyojyapuruṣapravṛttiviṣayādyavagamāt saṃpadyata iti tadabhidhāyakaśabdavyāpāras tatra karaṇatāṃ pratipadyate / itikartavyāṃśe tu arthavādapadavyāpāro 'syā avatiṣṭhate /	Therefore, an injunction aims at the rousing of the inclination of a person. Säbda-bhávanā discharges the function of an instrumental cause or a means which operates to bring an enjoined person into relation with an action. In other words, owing to the instrumentality of Šābda-bhavanà an inclination for undertaking an action is evoked.
kevalaṃ vidhipadaśravaṇe hi sati na tathā pravartayitum utsahante śrotāraḥ yathā arthavādajanitavahuprakārakarmaprāśastyajñānaparipoṣitahṛdayāḥ santaḥ iti arthavādāḥ pravṛttyatiśayahetavaḥ /	The listeners are not inspired to undertake actions when they listen to bare injunctions. But when they listen to various praises of such actions contained in the recommendatory passages, they become very much pleased at heart and are inspired to under- take actions enjoined by injunctions.
tena tadvyāpāra itikartavyatāṃśam astyāḥ pūrayatīti //	Thus these recommenda- tory passages increase the intensity of inclination.
evaṃ niyojyavyāpāro bhāvyaḥ viṣayādisamarpakapadavyāpāraḥ karaṇaṃ arthavādapadavyāpāraḥ itikartavyateti seyaṃ tryaṃśā śabdabhāvanā /	Hence the operation of recommendatory passages fulfills the procedure of Šābda-bhāvanā. The aim of Sabda-bhāvanā is to rouse the inclination of an agent for an action. Words which communi- cate an obligatory duty are the instrumental cause.
saiva ca vidhiḥ //	(The sense of this objection is as follows.
na ca vidher vākyārthān anvayalakṣaṇo doṣa āśaṅkanīyaḥ ekaprayayo pādānalakṣaṇayā pratyāsattyā tadanvitatvāvagamāt /	If an injunction implies Sabda-bhavana and a verb denotes the inclination of an agent then the meaning of a sen- tence cannot be communicated. How does a sentence communi- cate its meaning? If the meaning of a word is presented to us as syntactically related to that of another word in a sentence then the presentation of mutually related meanings is called verbal communication.
āhuś ca [vidhibhāvanāyos tv ekapratyayagrāhyatākṛtaḥ / dhātvarthāt prathamaṃ tāvat saṃbandho vyavasīyate] iti //	As an injunction and a bhāvaná are communicated to us by the same suffix so their mutual relation is at first determined and then they are related to the meaning of the basic root.
vidhir bhāvanāyāṃ purūṣaṃ niyuṅkte /	An injunction excites the activity of an agent towards a course of action.
yathā ''ha [svavyāpāre hi puruṣaḥ kartṛtvena niyujyate] iti //	Kumārila has rightly said that an injunction enjoins an agent to direct his own activity towards a course of action.
tayoḥ katham anvayaḥ syāt nanu ca tvayaivoktaṃ dhātvarthāt pūrvataraṃ tadbhāvanāyā vidheś ca saṃbaṃdho 'vagamyate /	Now, an objector raises an objection 'How does an in- junction relate itself with a bhāvanā?' Now the Värttikakāra himself has admitted that the mutual relation between an injunction and a bhāvanā is presented to our consciousness before their relation with the meaning of the root of a verb.
ekapadopādāne 'pi dhātvarthas tāvat prakṛtyaṃśābhidheyaḥ / vidhibhāvane tu dve api pratyayāṃśenābhidhīyete iti /	Though an inflected word denotes the senses of both the root of a verb and the suffix attached to it yet it is to be admitted that the meaning of the root of a verb constitutes the primary material and along with it the two meanings of the lin suffix, viz., an injunction and a bhāvanā are presented to our consciousness as an appendage.
ataś ca svacchaiva bhāvanā vidhinā spṛśyate na viṣayādyanuraktā /	Therefore, the activity of an agent is related, to an injunction without being directed to- wards a course of action.
svacchā ca na prayogayogyā bhavati /	But an injunction does not relate itself with a complete activity.
yathā ca phalakaraṇetikartavyatāṃśaparipūrtiprasthitā prayogayogyā na tāṃ vidhiḥ spṛṣṭavān /	It is a truism that an injunction does not know how to relate itself with the activity of an agent directed towards an end, viz., sacrifice etc.

It does not relax its efforts. But it waits for the fulfilment of its mission. It behaves like a bridegroom who has been wedded to a girl who is below her teens. As he patiently looks forward to her adolescence and for the buddihg of her beauty in each limb with his hands stretched, so the injunction tarries unless and until the activity in question takes a concrete shape, having enriched itself with all details, i.e., an agent engages himself in the actual performance of an obligatory duty.
āha ca [yady apy aṃśair asaṃspṛṣṭāṃ vidhiḥ spṛśati bhāvanām / tathāpy aśaktito nāsau tanmātre paryavasyati //	Though an injunction(Śäbda-bhāvanā) relates itself with such an activity of an agent as has not been connected with other factors yet it does not remain in situ, being thus related since it lacks the moving force.
anuṣṭheye hi viṣaye vidhiḥ puṃsāṃ pravartakaḥ /	An injunction prompts an agent to an obligatory duty.
aṃśatrayeṇa cāpūrṇāṃ nānutiṣṭhati bhāvanām //	But the activity of an agent does not become effective unless and until it is in close touch with its three elements.
tasmāt prakrāntarūpo 'pi vidhis tāvat pratīkṣate / yāvad yogyatvam āpannā bhāvanā 'nyān apekṣiṇī] // iti sā hi vākyāntaropāttam apy apekṣate prakaraṇāntarādhītam api vāṃchati /	It is also desirous of establish- ing relation with the meaning of the root of the verb in ques tion like the archetype. It also intends to establish a relation with a subject-matter implied by another such subject-matter. Such is the uniformly profound power of the verbal authority.
kṛtivad bhāvalabhyam api yācate / arthasāmarthyagamyaṃ pramāṇam api spṛhayati ity evaṃvidha eṣa śabdapramāṇamahimeti //	If we are to understand the meaning of a sentence referring to the activity of an agent then we are to pursue the method of interpretation and to unfold its meaning by degrees. A bhă- vanā constitutes the meaning of a sentence.
sa cāyaṃ vyutpādanakrama īdṛśo vyākhyātṛbhir upadiśyate ittham asyānvayaḥ ittham asyeti /	If it remains understood in a sentence then the blank place of the bhāvanā should be filled up and the import of the bhāvanā should be724 made out.

But we understand the meaning of a sentence from a sentence by one and the same method.
yathāha [bhāvanaiva hi vākyārthaḥ sarvatrākhyātavat tayā /	In every case the operative ending is attached to the root of a verb and hence the activity of an agent (ārthibhāvanā) constitutes the meaning of a sentence.

The whole series of acts is known as the single act of cooking. The main act of cooking consists of several minor acts such as pouring water, placing rice inside the pot, stirring the content by waiving ladle, the extraction of gruel etc. These acts extend over a long period of time. Similarly, verbal knowledge is one which commences from the knowledge of the meaning of a word and ends in the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence.
āha ca [padāt prabhṛti yā caiṣā prajñā jñātur vijṛmbhate /	Some say "The knowledge of a knower dawns with the knowledge of the meaning of a word.

Then it develops into the form of a fruit in the shape of the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence.
so 'yaṃ vākyārthaḥ bhāvanānāmadheya kartṛvyāpāraḥ svargayāgādir arthaḥ yas tu vyāpāraḥ praiṣarūpo liṅāder vācyaḥ kārye vā taṃ vidhiṃ saṅgirante //	Thus the meaning of a sentence goes under the name of Bhāvanā. It is the activity of an agent. It is directed towards heaven, sacrifice etc. But the activity which prompts one to do something is called Preşanã. It constitutes the primary meaning of the optative ending attached to the root of a verb.
tad etad ananumanyamānā anye pracakṣate /	Everybody denominates is as an injunction.
yo 'sau śabdabhāvanākhyaḥ śabdavyāpāraḥ śabdasya kāryo 'bhidheyaś ca tam abhidadhataḥ kurvato vā śabdasya vyāpārāntaram asti na vā // yadi tāvan nāsti tad eṣa vyāpārāntaranirapekṣasvavyāpāram ivārtham api vadatu viśrāmyatu vyāpārakalpanā / asti vedasya tadabhidhāne vyāpārāntaraṃ tadānavasthāpratīkāraḥ kaścid anveṣaṇīyaḥ /	They point out that śābda-bhāvanā is the activity which belongs to a word, is produced and denoted by it. When a word denotes and produces śābda-bhāvanā does it do, being itself inactive? Or, does it produce a process, having recourse to a distinct activity? If the propounders of the hypothesis answer in the negative then they will be compelled to admit that a word should directly communicate its meaning without the aid of an intervening process and the assumption of an intermediate process is redundant since it produces a process, unaided by another process.

bhūtaparispandavyatiriktavyāpāranirāsaś ca pramāṇasāmānyalakṣaṇe vistareṇa kṛtaḥ ity asau mārgaḥ ihāpy anusaraṇīyaḥ //	We have already elaborately discussed in the chapter on the definition of proofs in general that there is no distinct process excepting the vibration of elements. The reiteration of the same topic is superfluous.

Does a word firstly denote a process and then produce it? Or, does it at first bring about a process and then denote it? Or, does it simultaneously produce and denote a process? It is illogical to hold that a process is denoted when it has not come into being.
na hy ajāte putre nāmadheyakaraṇam /	Nobody christens his son when he is not726 born.
arthāsaṃsparśī ca tathā sati śabdaḥ syāt //	Moreover, in that case, a word is not related to its meaning.
ata eva na yugapad ubhayam anutpannatvānapāyāt prayatnagaurava prasaṅgāc ca / nāpi kṛtvā 'bhidhānam viramyavyāpārāsaṃvedanāt //	Again, a word does not simultaneously produce and denote a process since the non-production of a process precedes its denotation and the hypothesis requires toil and trouble on the part of its propounders to be demonstrated. The alter- native suggestion that a word creates and then denotes a process is not also tenable since as it does not endure long so it finds no opportunity of communicating the process after having created it.
api cāyaṃ tapasvī liṅādiḥ pratyayaḥ saty api gobṛndārakatve katham amum atibṛhantaṃ bhāraṃ vakṣyati kartāraṃ ca tatsaṃkhyāṃ cākhyāsyati /	How will the weak optative suffix in the presence of strong bulls carry a very heavy load? How will it express an agent, and the number and the activity of the agent? How will it produce an efficient force belonging to a word and communicate it? It can hardly bear the burden.
bhāvanām abhidhāsyate śabdabhāvanāṃ ca kariṣyati tāṃ ca vadiṣyati iti durvaho 'yaṃ bhāraḥ // kaś cāyam śabdhabhāvanānāmadheyasya vidher vākyārthe bhāvanāyām anvaya iti vaktavyam //	How does an injunction which goes under the name of Sabda-bhāvanā relate itself with the activity of an agent-the import of a sentence? An answer to this question has been already given. It has been replied that as an optative suffix denotes both word- efficient force and the activity of an agent so they enter into the relation of being denoted by one and the same suffix.
nanu ukta eva ekapratyayābhidheyatvalakṣaṇaḥ saṃbandha iti na brūma ābhidhānikaḥ saṃbandho nokta iti /	Now, the objector points out that though the relation of being denoted has been stated yet the crux of the problem has not been touched.

It is the principal meaning of a sentence. An end, an instrumental cause and the manner of performance are invariably required by the activity of an agent. The words such as 'svarga-kāma' etc.
śabdavyāpāras tu tadapekṣitam anyatamam api nāṃśaṃ pūrayitum alam iti tatra na guṇatām avalambate /	The meanings of these words render assistance to the activity of an agent as subsidiary elements. But word- efficient force fills up none of the requisite elements of the activity of an agent.
na ca dvayoḥ pradhānayoḥ ghaṭaḥ paṭa itivad vā pacati paṭhatītivad vā saṃbandha upalabhyate//	Two principal objects such as a jar and piece of cloth or two principal acts such as the act of cooking and that of reading are never noticed to be mutually related as princi- pal and accessory matters.
athārthabhāvanā śabdabhāvanākhyavidher viṣayasamarpaṇena guṇatām avalambate / vidhis tarhi vākyārthaḥ na bhāvanā tasyā aprādhānyāt /	Now, the upholder of the hypothesis may contend that an arthi bhavana is subordinate to a ŝabda-bhāvanā since theMandate denoted by a sentence activity of an agent is conducive to the subject-matter of an injunction bearing the title of śäbda-bhavana.
ato bhāvanādvayaṃ pratyayārtha iti na hṛdayaṃgamam etat //	Therefore, the assumption that an optative suffix denotes two principal meanings is not appreciated.
ekābhidhānābhidheyatvaṃ ca na bhāvanayor anyonyasamanvaye kāraṇam akṣāḥ pādāḥ māṣā ityādāv adarśanāt //	The words 'Akşa', 'Pada', 'Māsa' etc. admit of various meanings but the different meanings of each word are not known to be related to one another on the above ground.
kiṃ ca kasyānurodhena dve bhāvane pratyayavācye iṣyete / ucyate /	Moreover, in order to serve which purpose do you hold that the same suffix denotes the above two bhāvanās? An answer is given to this effect.
liṅādiśabdaśravaṇe sati kārye ca preraṇāyāṃ ca buddhir utpadyata iti //	When we hear the optative suffix the ideas of the object to be accomplished and prompting simultaneously flash in our mind.
yady evaṃ eka eva tādṛśo 'sau liṅartho bhavatu /	If this is the case then let only one meaning be denoted by the optative suffix.
tad ekatvāc ca na parasparasamanvayaḥ cintayiṣyate /	If it has only one meaning then the question of the mutual relation holding between the two meanings needs no discussion.
na ca pratyaye'py atibhāra āropayiṣyate/	And the optative suffix is not saddled with a heavy load.
nanu ekasyāpi liṅarthasya yadi śabdaḥ kāryatvaṃ preraṇāṃ ca bravīti tatas tadavastha evātibhāraḥ / kaś cāsāv ekaḥ kāryātmā preraṇātmā ca tasyārthaḥ /	A mandate is denoted by a sentence Now, we take for granted that the meaning of an optative suffix is one and the same. But if the said suffix communicates both duty and inspiration then it carries the same heavy load as before. What may be the meaning of the optative suffix which is both duty and inspiration ? An answer to the above question as given by Kumärila is as follows.
yo liṅādipratyayād avagamyate yam abhivadato na tasyātibhāraḥ yatra na tadvyatirekeṇa pramāṇāntaraṃ kramate sa niyogo nāmāvākyārthaḥ /	It is not a heavy task for an optative suffix to convey the same meaning as follows from it. The meaning of a sentence which no proof other than the optative suffix comes forward to convey is known as a mandate. (This mandate is nothing but an inspiration).
tathā hi vṛddhavyavahārataḥ śabdānām arthe vyutpattir ity atra tāvad avivāda eva / vyavahāre ca vākyārthe vākyasya vyutpattiḥ vākyena sarvatra vyavahārāt /	Every body agrees to the point that the meaning of a word is learnt from its usage. A general rule is noticed that in order to com- municate, the sense of a sentence is used since the above rule728 gets the sanction of usage.
tatra [yajeta] ityāditiṅantapadayukteṣu padāntarāṇām arthas tāvad āstām/	Among these sentences let us take into consideration such sentences as involve the verb 'yajeta'.
ākhyātārthe hy avagate tadānuguṇyenāsau sthāsyati /	Let us now discuss the meaning of the verb 'yajeta'.
ākhyātasya ca [yajeta] ity evamāder arthaḥ parīkṣyamāṇaḥ preraṇātmaka evāvatiṣṭhate yataḥ padāntarasannidhāne saty api na preraṇābuddhir upajāyate/	From the above discussion it follows that the verb 'yajeta' denotes inspiration. The meaning is detected by the application of the joint method of agreement and difference. When we hear other words we have no knowledge of inspiration.
ākhyātapadaśravaṇe ca sati sā jāyate/	But when we have the word 'yajeta' we have knowledge of inspiration.
tasmāt tasyaiva preraṇātmako 'rthaḥ /	In other words, it is proved that the verb 'yajeta' denotes inspiration.
tatrāpi tu juhotyādidhātvantaropajananāpāyaparyālocanayā dhātos tatpratītau vyabhicārāt pratyayasya cāvyabhicārāt tasyaiva so 'rtha iti gamyate /	If we discuss the meaning of the verb 'juhoti' etc. then we see that the verbal terminations, indicative of the present tense, the present perfect tense etc, denote the continuity of an act, the cessation of an act etc.
kaḥ punar asāv arthaḥ / yasmin sati [niyukto 'ham atra] iti pratipadyate puruṣaḥ so 'sāv arthaḥ /	What is the exact nature of the said inspiration? When this inspiration takes place and works within the heart of a listener he feels that he has been enjoined to discharge particular duty.
sa eva vidhir ity ucyate/	Such an inspi- ration goes under the title of injunction.
vidhau hi liṅādipratyayaṃ smarati pāṇiniḥ na dhātvarthe yāgādau na kartṛvyāpāre bhāvanāyām /	Pânini, the great grammarian, recollecting the old tradition of grammar, pres- cribes that an optative suffix denotes injunction. When a sacri- fice, the meaning of the root 'yaj' or the activity of an agent is mentioned no inspiration is communicated to us.
vidhiś ca nāma preraṇātmaka eva/	In a nut- shell an injunction itself is nothing but an inspiration.
ata eva vartamānāpadeśikākhyātajanitapratītivilakṣaṇeyaṃ pratītiḥ [yajeta] iti / atra hi praiṣapraiṣyayoḥ saṃbandho 'vagamyate/	But when the same verb is used in the optative tense viz., yajeta (one should sacrifice) it conveys a distinct sense since in this case the relation between an inspi- ration and the person who is inspired to do something is communicated.
anya evāyaṃ kriyākartṛsaṃbandhāt praiṣapraiṣyasaṃbandhaḥ / nanu [yajeta] iti kriyākartṛsaṃbandho 'vagamyate / na brūmaḥ nāvagamyata iti kin tu praiṣapraiṣyalakṣāṇo 'pi saṃbandhaḥ prathamam avagamyate /	Does not the above illustration convey the relation between a sacrifice and its agent? An answer to the above question is this: It isMandate denoted by a sentence 729 not a truism that the said relation is not conveyed. But it is also a fact that the relation between an inspiration and the inspired is at first conveyed.
preṣito hi kriyāṃ kartum udyacchatīti /	We hold that when a person is inspired he prepares himself to do an act.
nanu kriyāsaṃbandhitayaivāsau preṣyate [yajatāṃ bhavān] iti /	When a person is prompted to do an act how is he prompt- ed? Does he feel an abstract inspiration ? No, he is prompted to do a concrete act, viz., he is inspired by the sentence that he should perform a sacrifice.
satyam kriyāsaṃbandhitayaiva preṣyate/	The said inspiration has direct bearing upon a concrete act.
preṣyate ced ayaṃ tarhi saṃbandhaḥ / kriyāsaṃbandhāt tu ubhayasaṃbandhitām asya rājagavīkṣīravat avagamiṣyāmaḥ /	But when the performer of a sacrifice is prompted to do the relation between an inspiration and the inspired is held to be distinct from that which holds between the agent of the act of sacrifice and the act itself. Thus, the person who insti- tutes a sacrifice has double relations.
yathā gauḥ rājā ca saṃbandhyate kṣīreṇa ca yā rājasaṃbandhinī sā kṣīrasaṃbandhinī yā kṣīrasambandhinī sā rājasaṃbandhinīti /	He looks like the King's cow having double relations. She is related to the King. She is also related to her milk. She who is related to the King is related to milk. She who is related to milk is related to the King.
evam ihāpi puruṣaḥ preṣitena ca saṃbhantsyate kriyayā ca /	Similarly, a person will be related to prompting and to the act of sacrifice.
yaḥ preṣyate sa karoti atha yaḥ karoti preṣyate sa iti //	A person who is prompted does an act and the person who does an act is prompted.
nanu nedam ubhayaṃ bhavati praiṣo 'pi kriyaiva /	Inspiration has no double characters since prompting itself is an act.
pravartanaṃ hi kurvan pravartayati ity ucyate/	When a person is induced to do something that which induces is called a prompter.
so 'yaṃ kriyāsambandha eva bhavati /	Hence prompting itself is nothing but an act.
na tato 'nyaḥ praiṣapraiṣyasaṃbandha iti syād etad evam yadi vāyvādivat pravartane kartā liṅādiḥ syāt /	Thus the relation holding between prompting and the person who is induced is nothing but the relation of a person with an act. This objection would have been true if the meaning of the optative suffix had been the actual mover like the air etc.
[prerito 'ham atra] iti tu jñānajanakatvaṃ vidheḥ pravartakatvam /	An injunction is said to be the mover in the sense that it produces the awareness "I have been inspired to do it".
sa eṣa pravartanaṃ jñāpayati na karotīti anya evāyaṃ kriyākartṛsaṃbandhāt praiṣapraiṣyasaṃbandhaḥ //	It simply communicates an inspiration but does not actually inspire a person to do an act. Thus, the relation holding between inspiration and the inspired is distinct from the parti-730 cular case relation, i.e., the relation subsisting between a nomi- native case and a verb.
nanu jñānam api kriyaiva /	An awareness is nothing but an act.
tatkaraṇe ca punar api sa evāyaṃ kriyākartṛsaṃbandhaḥ/	Thus, the relation in question is that between a nominative case and a verb.
kārakajñāpakayor bhedasya suprasiddhatvāt /	This objection does not hold good, since, the distinction between a cause and a mark is well-known.
iha ca yo 'yaṃ yāgapuruṣayoḥ kriyākartṛsaṃbandhaḥ tato 'nyaṃ praiṣapraiṣyasaṃbandham upadarśayituṃ pravṛttāḥ smaḥ /	In this case, we, the Mimāṁsakas, have tried to prove that the relation subsisting between the institutor of a sacrifice and the act of sacrifice is an instance of that which holds between a nominative case and a verb and that the said relation is distinct from that existing between inspiration and the inspired.
sa tato vilakṣaṇaḥ pradarśita eva /	We have also established that they are distinct from each other.
vailakṣaṇye 'pi tasya yathākathaṃcit nāma kriyamāṇaṃ na vārayāmaḥ //	The Naiyāyikas say that they do not preclude the Mimāṁsakas from assigning any name to the distinct relation in order to mark its distinction.
bhavatv ayam anyaḥ praiṣapraiṣyasaṃbandhaḥ /	Let the relation between inspiration and the inspired be a distinct one.
sa tu prathamam avagamyate ity eṣa kuto niścayaḥ/ uktam atra [preṣito 'ham] iti hi viditvā kriyāyāṃ pravartate /	How do you know that it is at first apprehended? A person undertakes an obligatory duty when he knows that he has been ordered to do it.
[ācāryacoditaḥ karomi] iti hi dṛśyate /	It is seen that he performs a sacrfice when he is induced by his teacher.
[yajeta] iti śrute [niykto 'ham] iti prathamam avagacchati /	When one listens to the Vedic injunction 'One should perform a sacrifice (yajeta)' he realises at first that he has been ordered to perform it.
tato yujyate /	And afterwards he performs a sacrifice.
tenāyam ādyaḥ saṃbandhaḥ /	For this reason the meaning of the optative suffix is known at the out- set.
paścātyas tu kriyākartṛsaṃbandhaḥ /	It is a mandate. It is denoted by a sentence in the optative mood.
tat yo 'yaṃ liṅarthaḥ prathamam avagamyate praiṣo nāma sā preraṇā sa niyogaḥ sa vākyārthaḥ // nanu vidhāv iva nimantraṇādiṣu liṅloṭāv api smaryate eva /	It has been stated by the grammarians that the optative and the imperative suffixes denote an incentive since none of their senses is dissociated from the above sense. The meaning of the causative suffix is different from that of the optative suffix: The incentive which is conveyed by the imperative suffix etc.
satyam te tu preraṇāyā evāupādikā avāntarabhedāḥ /	The causative suffix is prescribed when the activity of a causer is to be conveyed.
samahīnajyāyoviṣaya eva prayogopādhinibandhana eṣa preṣaṇādhyeṣaṇādibhedavyavahāraḥ /	When an incentive is to be conveyed the imperative suffix is prescribed. Hence, the mean- ing of the imperative suffix is identical with that of the causative one.
tad uktam [pravartakatvaṃ tu śabdārthaḥ sarvatrāparityāgāt] iti /	Thus, he who says 'Do this, do this' causes another to do this.
sa cāyaṃ liṅādīnām arthaḥ praiṣo ṇijarthavilakṣaṇaḥ pratīyate // nanu prayojakavyāpare ṇic vidhīyate/	This is the sum and substance of the objection raised by an objector. The above objections are not tenable since they produce different forms of awareness in our mind. The senten- ces 'Let him do.
prayojakavyāpāraś ca praiṣaḥ / praiṣe ca loḍādayo vidhīyante iti ṇijartha eva loḍarthaḥ/	The activity of a causer is denoted by the causative suffix. But the activity of a mark is denoted by the imperative suffix. The activity of a causative agent is in concern with an activity which has commenced.
tathā ca [kuru kuru] iti yo brūte sa kārayatīty ucyate na pratītibhedāt /	This is the exact meaning of the causative suffix. But in case of the impe- rative suffix the sense is contrary to that of the above one.
anyā hi [karotu] [kuryāt] iti pratītiḥ anyā ca [karoti] [kārayati] iti pratītiḥ /	In case of the causative suffix a person commences an act and another person causes him to do it.
pravṛttakriyāviṣayaś ca prayojakavyāpāro ṇijarthaḥ iha tu tadviparītaḥ / tatra hi kāryaṃ paśyataḥ pravartanam iha tu pravatitasya[pravartitasya?] kāryadarśanaṃ iti mahān bhedaḥ //	But in case of the optative suffix a man is prompted to do an act by means of an incentive and when he has moved to do it he experiences the performance of an act. Thus there is a great gulf of difference fixed between them. When we use a verb in the causative form a person causes one who is doing something to do it.
tatra yathā kurvantaṃ kārayati tathaivehāpi praiṣaḥ pravartamānaṃ prerayati nāpravartamānaṃ sthāvaram iti /	But when we use a verb in the optative mood an incentive is given to a man who has capacity for discharging a duty. An immobile object which has no capacity for discharging a duty is not stirred.
na hi vanaspatir ucyate [yajasva] iti / na / sthāvarāder ayogyatvāt /	With regard to the lord of trees it is not enjoined 'You should per-732 form a sacrifice.' Since an immobile object has no such capa- city.
brāhmaṇādis tu yaḥ preryate asāv apravṛttakriya eva /	A Brahmin who is inspired by an injunction to perform a sacrifice has not yet commenced to perform a sacrifice.
na hi yajamāna eva yajeta iti codyate kin tu apravṛttakriya eveti sarvathā ṇijarthād vilakṣaṇo liṅarthaḥ //	With regard to the institutor of a sacrifice an injunction 'One should perform a sacrifice' is not enjoined. But it is only enjoined with regard to one who has not as yet commenced to perform a sacrifice.
sa tu pramāṇāntarāvagamyaś cet tad upadṛśyatām ayam asāv evaṃrūpa iti/ pramāṇāntarānavagamaś cet kathaṃ śabdaikagocare tatra saṃbandhavyutpattiḥ /	Thus, the meaning of the causative suffix is in all res- pects different from that of the optative suffix. If verbal proof is the only source of a command how is a command com- municated to us as the meaning of such and such word ? Some thinkers raise an objection to the above hypotheses.
śabdaikagocaras tu niyogaḥ vyutpattiś ca tatra sūpapādaiva/	When we listen to the sentence in the optative mood viz.
yo hi [yajeta] [dadyāt] [juhuyāt] iti liṅādibhyo vidhiḥ pratīyate katham asau liṅādīnām gamya iṣyeta / vyutpattiś cāsya vyavahārād avakalpate/	an injunction is presented to our consciousness. How do we admit that this injunction is com- municated to us by the optative suffix ? An answer to this question is that from the usage we determine that the optative suffix denotes the above sense.
[gaccha] [adhīṣva] iti śṛṇvan vṛddhaḥ ceṣṭamāno dṛśyate /	When an experienced person listens to the sentence 'Go and read' it is noticed that he makes haste to act accordingly.
pratyakṣadṛṣṭe cāmrādau sukhasādhanatayānvayavyatirekābhyām avagate tadanusmaraṇāt pravartamānaḥ kasmiṃścid ātmakṛte samupajāte sati bhautikaṃ vyāpāram ārabhate /	Suppose, a per- son perceives a delicious fruit such as a mango etc. and has definitely known by the joint method of agreement and diff- erence that it is conducive to pleasure. Now if he longs for it, recollecting its conduciveness to pleasure then he gets by it and relishes.
sa cātmadharmaḥ ātmeva svasaṃvedyaḥ//	Such a desire is an attribute of the soul. It is introspected like the soul.
ahaṃpratyayagamyo hy ātmā nāsau parasmai darśayituṃ śakyate /	The soul is an object of self-con- sciousness. We cannot exhibit it to another person.
na ca na carcayituṃ śakyate / etāvatā nānubhūyata iti na śakyate vaktum /	On that ground it cannot be held that no discussion about the soulOptative suffixes 733 is possible. The hypothesis that the soul is intuited by no- body is not tenable.
paro 'pi hy enam ahaṃpratyayenānubhavaty eva /	A third person can introspect his soul by means of self-consciousness.
na ca na vedyate tatsaṃvedane sati ceṣṭāyā dṛṣṭatvāt /	It can only be introspected. It is not a truism that the said desire trans- cends our knowledge.
tasmāt param api [gaccha] [adhīṣva] iti śabdaśravaṇe sati ceṣṭāpanna dṛṣṭvā tasyāpi tādṛkpreraṇāvagamo 'numīyate / sa ca śabdāntaraśravaṇe saty apy adṛśyamānaḥ liṅādiśravaṇe ca sati dṛśyamānaḥ tadartha evety anvayavyatirekābhyām avagamyate itīyatīyaṃ vyutpattiḥ /	When we see that another person moves for doing something we infer that the listener of the injunctive sentence has the knowledge of the incen- tive or the command conveyed by the injunctive sentence. It is our experience that when we hear the optative suffix etc. we feel an inspiration but when we do not hear such a word we do not feel such inspiration. Thus we determine the meaning of the said suffix by the joint method of agreement and difference.
tad etad ātmapratyakṣam /	This is our solution to the above problem.
liṅādiśravaṇe sati preraṇāvagatiḥ bhavati prathamaśrutāc ca liṅāder asau na bhavati /	But when a person hears the optative suffix for the first time he does not become aware of the incentive to work.
na ca pramāṇāntareṇa so 'rtho darśayituṃ śakyate [kuryāt] ity asyārthaḥ kuryād ity anenaiva pratipādyate na prakārāntareṇety evaṃ vyutpattau saṃbhavantyām api yair agṛhītasaṃbandha eva liṅādiḥ svarūpasāmarthyenaiva preraka iṣyate te 'tyantabhīrava ity upekṣaṇīyāḥ //	The said inspiration can be made known to us by no other proof. The meaning of the verb 'kurvat can only be communicated by the verb 'kuryat'. But no other proof can reveal the meaning of the said suffix. In the face of such a conclusion those who hold that the optative suffix without any reference to the knowledge of the relation of denotation com- municates an incentive to duty by its own intrinsic force lack the courage of conviction.
nanu yadi liṅādivyatirekeṇa nānyato niyogo 'vagamyate katham asau niyogaśabdāt pratīyate/ katham vā niyogaśabdasya nāmno 'py arthaḥ pramāṇāntaragocaraḥ syāt /	If you hold that no word excepting the optative suffix con- veys a command then how is it that word 'niyoga' conveys a command and the meaning of the word should fall outside the scope of all proofs other than the verbal one? Oh Sir! a command cannot be communicated to us by the derivation of the word 'niyoga'.
na niyogaḥ nipūrveṇa yujinā ghañatena bodhayituṃ śakyate /	Its etymological derivation is this:-The root, Yuj' has the indeclinable 'ni' as its prefix and 'ghan' as its suffix.
vyavahāramātram etatsvarūpam ākhyātum āśrīyate yathā tu yajeta ity evamādibhyaḥ śabdebhyaḥ so 'vagamyate tathā nānyata ity ata eva na pramāṇāntaragocaro dharma ity āhuḥ //	The above derivation is resorted to only to explain the form of the said word. As the command is conveyed by the verbs 'yajeta' etc. so it is communicated to us by no other words. Hence the Mīmāṁsakas hold that 'Dharma' is revealed734 by no proof other than the verbal testimony.
liṅartho hi niyogo vākyārthaḥ/	The function of the optative suffix is command (niyoga).
sa eva dharmaḥ /	It is nothing but the obligatory duty itself.
sa ca na pramāṇāntaragamya iti //	It is revealed only by the verbal testi- mony but by no other proofs.
nanu liṅarthaḥ preraṇātmako 'yaṃ vyākhyātaḥ kāryātmā cāyam anuṣṭheyo dharmaḥ /	It is not reasonable to hold that the optative suffix conveys an operation which prompts one to perform an obligatory duty.
sa eva ca vākyārtho yuktaḥ /	It communicates an obligatory duty which is the meaning of a sentence.
kārye 'rthe vedasya prāmāṇyam iti mīmāṃsakāḥ /	Some Mīmāṁsakas hold that the Vedas purport to convey only objects to be accom- plished but not existent realities.
tasmāt punar api bhāṭṭapakṣavat dvayam āpatati prerakaś ca vidhiḥ kāryarūpaś cānuṣṭheyo 'rtha iti sukhaidhito niranusandhāna ivāyuṣmān evaṃ vyavaharati /	A niyoga prompts one to perform an obligatory duty by its verbal force. The hypothesis in question like that of the Bhaṭṭas sug- gests that an injunction has got two parts to play. It plays the role of a mover and that of a rite to be performed.
niyoga eva prerakaḥ niyogo eva cānuṣṭheyaḥ //	You boldly assert that a niyoga is a mover and is also a rite to be performed.
kathaṃ dvairūpyam asya śabdo vadatīti cet maivam /	How do other thinkers suggest double characters of a niyoga? They cannot entertain this suggestion.
prerakatvam evaśabdārthaḥ ārthaṃ tu kāryatvam /	When it is comprehended from the side of its meaning it is a rite to be performed since an in- junction points to an act to be performed.
yato vidhir evānuṣṭheyatayā 'vagamyate [ācāryājñāṃ karomi] [rājñājñāṃ karomi] iti //	When a person says 'I carry out the order of my preceptor I execute the royal man- date' why does he perform an act-the content of an injunc- tion? If this is the question then we give the following ans- wer.
kimarthaṃ tarhi viṣayānuṣṭhānam iti cet na hy ājñā ghaṭādivat svarūpeṇa kartuṃ śakyā api tu viṣayadvārakaṃ tatsaṃpādanam /	An order has no concrete shape like a jar and hence it cannot be worked out. We are to work out the content of an order, i. e. the object to which the said order points.
[kamaṇḍulaṃ bibhṛhi] ity ācāryeṇājñāptaḥ kamaṇḍulaṃ bhṛtvācāryājñāṃ kṛtāṃ manyate/	When a preceptor orders his pupil "You should carry a kind of wooden water-pot' he thinks that he has obeyed the order of his preceptor by carrying a water-pot.
[kaṭakaṃ gaccha] iti rājñāptaḥ kaṭakaṃ gatvā rājājñāṃ kṛtāṃ manyate /	When a king orders his officer 'Go to the fort' he thinks that he has executed the order of the king by going to the fort.
so 'yaṃ niyoga evānuṣṭheyaḥ //	Therefore, a niyoga (an order) is nothing but an act to be performed.
nanu [rājājñayā karomi] ity api vyapadeśo dṛśyate /	There is a verbal usage to this effect 'I do this by royal order'.
sa cānanuṣṭheyām evājñāṃ darśayati/	This shows that the said order points to the act to be performed.
maivam/ tatrāpy ājñaivanuṣṭheyā /	735 A Niyoga Stirs Our Activity When Its Sense Is Grasped.
preṣāṇābhiprāyeṇa tṛtīyānirdeśa ity evaṃ kecit // anye tu śābdaṃ kāryatvaṃ niyogasya prerakatvaṃ tv arthād ity ācakṣate //	But other thinkers of the Prabhakara school hold that the verbal aspect of an injunctive sentence implies the obligatory duty to be discharged and that the sense of an injunctive sen- tence points to it (the said sentence) as a mover.
anuṣṭheyatā hi tasya nijaṃ rūpam /	The intrinsic nature of niyoga (an embodiment of command=an injunctive sentence) is the state of an act to be performed.
svasiddhaye sa tu niyojyaṃ niyuṃjānaḥ preraka ity ucyate /	But as they very niyoga induces the man ordered to discharge his duty so it is called a mover.
tad idaṃ kāryatvaṃ aparityaktaprerakabhāvam asyāvagamyate /	It also acts as an inducer without forsaking the character of being an obligatory duty.
prerakatvaṃ cāparityaktakāryabhāvam ity anyatarad atra śābdaṃ rūpaṃ anyatarac cārthaṃ rūpam iti na bhāṭṭair ivāsmābhiḥ pratyaye gurur bhāra āropitaḥ //	The import of the verbal aspect of the suffix does not overburden the optative suffix as Kumārila does.
sa cāyaṃ niyogaḥ pratīyamānaḥ [yajeta svargakāmaḥ] ity anubandhadvayāvacchinnaḥ pratīyate /	An Injunction Having no Reference to an end acts an Inducer: The very niyoga which is conveyed to us by the very words constituting an injunction is "yajeta svarga-kāmaḥ”.
yajyādināsya viṣayānubandho dhātunocyate / [svargakāmaḥ] ity adhikārānubandhaḥ padāntareṇārpyate / tatra ca svargakāmasyaivādhikāro nirvahati /	The root 'yaji' expresses one of these two concomitants viz., the act to be performed. Another compound word 'svarga- kamah' suggests the second concomitant viz., the person who has right to perform a sacrifice and enjoys its fruit.
yadi bhāvārthasya svargaṃ prati sādhanatvam avagamyate evaṃ tarhi svargakāmenaivāsau kṛto bhavatīti svargakāmapadānvaye prāktana vā mārgo 'numantavyaḥ na punaḥ svargādiphalapradarśanapūrvakaṃ vidheḥ pravartakatvam asvātantryaprasaṅgāt /	Thus, it amounts to this that only a person, desirous of heaven, performs a sacrifice and the path, already chalked out, is to be followed to establish syntactical relation between a sacrifice and one desirous of heaven. But we do not think that an injunctive sentence induces a person to perform a sacrifice because it exhibits the fruit of the enjoined sacrifice. Ifsuch a view is held then the independence of an injunction is at stake.
na hīdṛśaṃ śāstrasya daityam yat phalaṃ vinā puṃsaḥ pravartayituṃ na śaknotīti /	An injunction is not so weak that it cannot induce a person to perform a sacrifice till it does not exhibit the fruit of the action enjoined.
anyathā [yāvaj jīvaṃ yajeta] ityādāv apravartakaṃ śāstraṃ syāt /	Very well, a question is now put to you viz., 'Are these injunctions 'One should sacrifice as long as he lives' etc.
kiṃ [yāvaj jīvaṃ] ityādicodanāḥ phalaśūnyā eva /	absolutely fruitless?' The Mimāṁsakas say 'We answer in the affirmative'. They admit that these are fruitless.
om ity ucyate /	The reason behind this admission is this.
na hi vidhiḥ phalam ākāṅkṣati api tu niyojyaṃ viṣayaṃ ca kasya niyogaḥ kutra niyogaḥ iti /	An injunctive sentence does not require a fruit for its completion. But an injunction 'One should perform a sacrifice' requires two essential ele- ments for its completion.
te ete ubhe apy ākāṅkṣe paripūrṇe /	These two elements are related to sacrifice as an injunction requires them.
tatra jīvato niyogaḥ yāge ca niyoga iti/	If this is the case then the above in- junction 'One should sacrifice so long as he lives' its import is that a living person is enjoined and the obligatory duty is to perform a sacrifice.
ataḥ paraṃ phalakalpanaṃ puruṣabuddhiprabhavaṃ bhavati na śāstrīyam /	Then the fruit of this injunction will be assumed after mature consideration. It is not mentioned in the scriptures.
kāmādhikāre tu niyojyataiva anyathā svargakāmasya nopapadyata iti svargasya sādhyatvam abhyupagatam na punar vidheḥ phalārthatvāt /	The injunction in question purports to convey that heaven is the goal and a sacrifice is a means to its attainment. The word 'svarga-kámaḥ' has not been inserted in the injunc- tion to serve the useful purpose of exhibiting the result of this sacrifice.
ata eva na tatra vaidhī pravṛttiḥ lipsayaiva pravṛttatvāt/	Therefore an injunction does not function to stir movement for the attainment of goal.
āha ca tasya lipsā 'rthaṃ lakṣaṇā iti/ sādhyasādhanabhāvapratipādanaparyavasito hi tatra vidhivyāpāraḥ na prayogaparyavasita iti //	Some authori- tative persons hold that a desire for the attainment of goal is the real motive which drives a person to action and an injunc- tion lacks the driving force since an injunction completes its mission, vindicating the relation of means to its end.
ata eva śyenāder adharmatvam / tatra hi [abhicaran] iti śatrā śatruṃ vaidikenopāyena jighāṃsur adhikārī darśitaḥ tasya /	Hence, as the Syena sacrifice is a sinful act so in that case it has been shown that a person who desires to kill his enemy by737 Injunctions and their scope is means of the Vedic mystic-rite has right to perform the Syena sacrifice.
na tatra śāstraṃ pravartakam / jānāty evāsau [mayaitat kartavyam upāyaṃ tu na veda] ity evam /	The person does not make out from the passage that the killing of an enemy his duty. But he does not simply know the means to the killing of his enemy.
upāyamātram asyopadiśyate śyenaḥ /	The scripture simply gives him instruction with regard to the more means of slaughter.
[śyenaṃ kuru] iti tu na vidhiḥ prabhavati jighāṃsāyā eva tatra pravartakatvāt /	The said injunction does not influence him to perform the Syena sacrifice since the strong desire to kill his enemy drives him to perform the said sacrifice.
ataḥ śyenāder adharmatvāt tadvyudāsārthapadopādānaṃ [codanālakṣano 'rtho dharmaḥ] iti //	Therefore, the word 'beneficial matter' has been put in the definition of Dharma (Duty) in order to exclude sinful deeds such as the Syena sacrifice etc.
kāmādhikāreṣu hītikartavyatāṃśe śāstrīyā pravṛttiḥ / yathoktaṃ [kratvartho hi śāstrād avagamyate] iti /	When the qualification of a person is determined by his desire of some fruit the scriptural passages induce him to adapt such procedure of performance as is a necessary means to a rite.
bhāvārthamātrasya hi karaṇatvam avagatam /	In case of the verb 'yajeta' a sacrifice, the meaning of the said verb is known to be a means to heaven.
itikartavyatāṃśas tu na karaṇatvāvagativelāyām upanipatita iti tatra lipsāyā abhāvāt śāstram eva pravartakam //	Hence, at that time scriptural passages alone induce a person to adopt procedure of performance since there is no desire of some fruit which may act as a motive.
ata eva agnīṣomīyahiṃsāyā nādharmatvam /	In that case the killing of an animal is one of manners of per- formance.
[na hiṃsyāt sarvā bhūtāni] iti niṣedhaḥ sāmānyaśāstram /	The general rule extends its jurisdiction over all matters without encroaching upon the sphere of a particular rule.
sāmānyaśāstraṃ ca viśeṣaśāstrakroḍīkṛtaviṣayaparihāreṇa pravartata iti agnīṣomīyahiṃsāyāḥ śāstrīyatvāt na niṣedhavidhiḥ anarthatāṃ bodhayed iti // nanu śyene 'pi śāstrīyā pravṛttiḥ /	As the killing of an animal is one of the subsidiary actions of the rite dedicated to Agni and Soma and is laid down by the Scripture so the general rule which prohibits animal-slaugh- ter cannot declare it to be a sinful act.738 Nyāyamanjari An Injunction Induces a Person to an Action Without Referring to its Fruit Now, a fresh problem arises in our mind.
pravartakatvaṃ hi vidheḥ svarūpaṃ pramāṇāntaravilakṣaṇam / nānvayavyatirekavatsādhyasādhanapratītimātraparyanto hi vidhivyāpāro bhavitum arhatīti sarvatra vidheḥ prayoktṛtvānapāyāt /	It is not a truism that an injunction throws light only on the relation between a means and an end like the joint method of agreement and difference since an injunction is nowhere obstructed in its normal function of instigating person to ac- tions expressly stated by the Vedas.
evam eva ceyaṃ pravṛttiḥ śyenena yajeteti //	Similarly, in case of the injunction "One should perform Syena sacrifice" the move- ment of a person for the action is likewise instigated.
ucyate [pravartito 'haṃ] iti jñānajananaṃ vidheḥ prerakatvam / tata satyaṃ sarvatra tulyaṃ karaṇe ca śyene itikartavyatāyāṃ agnīṣomīye /	The instigation of an injunction consists in pro- ducing the judgment "I (the listener) have engaged myself in such and such action." It is a true reflection on the charac- teristic feature of an injunction since an injunction uniformly behaves in all cases viz.
bāhye tu pravṛttilakṣaṇe bhautike vyāpāre yatra lipsādi prakārāntaram asti tatra bhavanty api vidheḥ prayauktṛśaktir udāste paśupuroḍāśaprayājavat /	Though in the matter of external worldly activities the compelling force of an injunction remains intact yet if desire of some gain and similar other motives over and above anin- junction induce a person to an action then the power of in- stigation belonging to an injunction stands neutralized as it remains neutral in fore-sacrifices which are required as a means to the animal cake-offering.
tatrodāsīne vidhau niṣedhaśāstram avatarati [na hiṃsyāt] iti //	Hence, it has been said that the injunctive function i.e. the power of instigation remains inactiveInjunctions and their scope 739 In the case of the neutrality of the power of instigation the prohibitive law "None should kill an animal" exerts its influ- ence.
yadi tu sarvatraiva prayoktṛśaktir udāsīnā bhavet tadā jyotiṣṭomān na viśiṣyata śyenaḥ śāstrīyāyāṃ pravṛttau agnīṣomīya iva niṣedhaśāstrasyānavakāśāt //	But if, inevery case, the power of instigation, belong- ing to an injunction, remains unimpaired then Śyena sacrifice is in no way distinct from Jyotiştoma sacrifice since as a pro- hibitive passage exerts no influence upon the undertaking of Agnișoma sacrifice so it does not stand in the way of one's first move for Syena sacrifice.
jyotiṣṭome 'nullaṃghitaniṣedho 'dhikārī svargasyāniṣiddhatvāt /	It may be objected that in the case of Jyotiştoma sacrifice the enjoyer of the fruit of the said sacrifice does not transgress the prohibitive passage by his enjoyment since heaven is not a forbidden fruit.
śyene tu hiṃsāyāḥ pratiṣiddhatvāt utkrāntaniṣedho 'dhikārīti cet maivam /	But in the case of Syena sacrifice 'as the killing of animals is prohibited so he who enjoys the fruit of Syena sacrifice transgresses the prohibitive passage.
adhikāridaśāyām api bhavanmate vidheḥ prayoktṛtvānapāyāt na niṣedhaśāstram avakāśaṃ labhata iti śyene 'pi nāvadhīritaniṣedho 'dhikārī syāt //	Such an objection does not hold good since when a person acquires the right to perform Syena sacri- fice the enjoyer of its fruit does not transgress the prohibitive passage. In other words, the force of the injunction which governs Syena sacrifice remains equally strong.
nanu na vidhiḥ phale prayojyaṃ prerayati [phalaṃ kuru] iti /	Therefore, the fruit of Syena sacrifice is not affected by the prohibitive passage.
karmaṇi tv enaṃ pravartayati [yajasva] iti /	In other words, Syena sacrifice is a sinful act.
tenādhikāridaśāyām apratihato niṣedhaśāstrāvakāśaḥ āyuṣman asmatpakṣam evāśrito 'si /	The critics subject this view to a serious criticism. They say "Oh long-lived one you have entered into our views.
phale cen na pravartayati vidhiḥ puruṣaṃ phalārthitvād evainam upaye pravartamānaṃ tatrāpi na prerayet /	If an injunction does not induce a person to bring about the result of an action as he desires it then it should not also insti- gate him to adopt its means.
upāyānabhijñasya tu upāyam eva darśayet / yāvad aprāptaṃ hi vidher viṣayaḥ /	An injunction reveals only a means to an ignorant person since an injunction establishes only what has not been previously established.
tad uktaṃ [jānāty evāsau mayaitat kartavyaṃ upāyaṃ tu na veda] iti /	It has been stated that the person knows that he should do an act but does not know the exact means.
pratītir apīyam īdṛśī [abhicaran yajet] iti / [yadi tvaṃ śāstrīyenopāyena vairiṇaṃ hantum udyataḥ śyenena jahi śyenas tavopāyaḥ] ity arthaḥ /	But if the means of killing his enemy is not prohi- bited by the scriptural passage then it is to be admitted that. the person who performs Syena sacrifice does not transgress scriptural prohibition. Kill your enemy with the magical prac- tice of Śyena sacrifice.
tad alam atiprasaṅgena //	We need not unnecessarily prolong this discussion.
kāmādhikāreṣu tāvat na phalākāṅkṣī vidhiḥ/ phalaṃ tv adhikāre hetur iti sthitam // pratiṣedhādhikāre 'pi pratyavāyo na kalpate /	In the case of a qualification based upon desire of some fruit an injunction does not require a result. But the rule is that a result is the means of acquiring the proper qualification to perform a rite.
niṣedhyādiviṣayād eva labdhatvād adhikāriṇaḥ // tatrāsau kalpyamāno 'pi narakādiphalodayaḥ /	Even if we assume that the said act, viz., Śyena sacrifice produces evil consequences such as hell, etc., then the said Śyena sacrifice does not get the sanction of an injunction.
avaidhatvaṃ prapadyeta na hy ākāṅkṣedṛśī vidheḥ //	But the injunction which prescribes Śyena sacrifice should not be so dishonoured.
vidher apekṣe dve eva niyojyaviṣayau prati / tatpūraṇena tṛptas tu na vāṃchati tato 'dhikam //	When these two factors are supplied an injunction becomes complete in itself but requires no other additional factors for its completion.
niyojyas tāvad etāvān kruddho 'rihananodyataḥ / viṣayas tannivṛttiś ca niyogo yatra gamyate //	In the case of Syena sacrifice a person who is in a fit of rage and ready to kill his enemy is qualified to perform it. The result of this act is the killing of an enemy towards which the qualified person is directed.
nanu etāvan na vibudhyāmahe niṣedhavidheḥ ko viṣaya iti /	The determination of the subject-matter of prohibition We cannot till now make out what is the import of a prolii- bitive injunction.
[bhāvārthāḥ karmaśabdās tebhyaḥ kriyā pratīyeta] iti sthite nañarthas tāvat pūrvāparībhūtatvāt na vidher viṣayaḥ ananvitābhidhānāc ca /	The verbal terminations denote activitics741 Injunctions and their scope directed towards an end. The basic roots to which they are attached denote acts to be accomplished.
na hi naño 'nantaraṃ liṅvibhaktiḥ śrūyate api tu hanteḥ / hananam api na vidhe viṣayaḥ tasya dharmatvaprasaṅgāt nañprayogasya vaiyarthyaprasakteḥ /	A negative particle denotes negation which is not accomplished in a consecutive series. Hence, it does not constitute the subject-matter of an injunction. The negative particle is not construed with verbal termination called lin.
nañviśiṣṭo 'pi na hantyartho 'sya viṣayaḥ tayor viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāvābhāvāt //	So, negation is never implied by an injunction since the said verbal termination is not attached to the negative particle.
yuktaṃ dadhnā juhotīti home dadhyanuraktatā / hanteḥ svarūpanāśāt tu na nañarthānuraktatā //	But it (the verbal termination) is attached to the root 'han'. The act of killing cannot be enjoined by an injunction since if it had been implied by an injunction then it would have been dharma (duty).
puruṣaprayatno 'pi na kevalo vidher viṣayaḥ svataśiddhatvāt /	There is no necessity of an injunction which prescribes killing since men have natural propensity for doing it.
nāpi nañarthānuraktaḥ kutrāpi nañarthasya viśeṣaṇatvānupapatteḥ // athāyam abrāhmaṇādinyāyena hantau paryudaste bhāvārthāntare niyogaḥ kalpyate [na hanyāt] iti ko 'rthaḥ /	The meaning of the root 'han' (to kill) as qualified by the meaning of the negative particle is not enjoined by an injunc- tion since the meaning of the negative particle does not qualify the meaning of the root 'han' (to kill) in the manner in which an adjective qualifies its corresponding noun.
atha viṣayāṃśaṃ parihṛtya pramāṇāṃśe nañ niviśate sā hi pravartamānapumāṃsaṃ ruṇaddhi yaddhanyāt anneti tad apy anupapannam / anvitābhidhānena vidhivibhakter hantinā 'varuddhatvāt /	In the case of the injunctive sentence "He offers an oblation with sour milk" sour milk has logical ground to qualify the offering of an oblation since it is the instrumental case of such offering. But it is not reasonable to hold that the meaning of the negative particle modifies the act of killing because the very act of killing itself is negated, i.e.
preraṇaśaktisvabhāvo vidhiḥ sthitaḥ /	the very act ceases to exist.
yas tu niṣedhātmā nañ pārśve sthitaḥ tatra na vidhiḥ saṃkrāmati /	A mere human effort does not constitute the subject-matter of an injunction since such an effort does not owe its origin to an injunction, i.e., it comes into existence independently of an injunction.
saṃkrāntāv api nañaś ca saṃbandhe sati vidheḥ svarūpanāśo 'vagamyate / svabhāvo hy eṣa nañaḥ yad ayaṃ yena yena saṃbadhyate tasya tasyābhāvaṃ bodhayatīti / ato vidhisaṃbandhe naña iṣyamāṇe etāvān vākyārtho 'vatiṣṭhate hananavidhir nāstīti /	An effort which is qualified by the meaning of the negative particle does not form the subject-matter of an injunction since the negative particle does not logically qualify it as it does not modify the act of killing. As words 'non-Brahmin', etc., purport to convey emphatic denial, i.e., they convey the sense of some positive objects deter- mined by negation so 'non-killing' implies emphatic denial but not bare denial.
tataś ca hananasya vidhitvaṃ ca syāt //	If this is so then it will be employed to denote a positive act other than the act of killing.
atrocyate [dadhnā juhoti] iti homasya vacanāntaracoditatvāt vidhivibhaktiśaktir upapadaṃ saṃkāmatīti yathā varṇitaṃ evam ihāpi hanane svataḥ pravṛttatvena vidhivaiphalyāt nañaś ca śrūyamāṇasyānarthakyaprasaṅgāt vidhāyikā śaktiḥ nañartham eva spṛśatīti kiṃ neṣyate /	If this meaning is admitted then what is the specific nature of the act? We cannot make out any sense of 'shall not kill' if its meaning is carefully examined. If it is said that non-killing implies any act whatsoever other than the act of killing then such a view is not tenable. Any and every act is not incited by an injunction. Such acts owe their origin to natural propensities not inspired by injunctions. Hence, an injunction becomes unnecessary.
nanu uktam atra [bhāvārthāḥ karmaśabdāḥ] iti /	They hold that the word 'Karma' denotes an action.
tatra dadhyanurakto homa eva vidhīyata iti phalato dadhi vihitaṃ bhavati na pramāṇataḥ /	Therefore, considering it from the side of its result the offering of an oblation is enjoined by an injunction. But it is not proved by any proof.
iha tu nañas tadupamardasvabhāvatvāt saṃsargo dadhyāder iva kalpate // maivam nivṛttim eva kurvan viśeṣaṇībhavati /	But in the case of the prohibive in- junction that he shall not kill, the negative particle cannot be logically construed with any word as the word "sour milk” is construed with the offering of an oblation since the nature of the negative particle is to negate.
seyaṃ nañupahite hantau śrute hanananivṛttir gamyate /	When we hear the root 'han' as modified by the nega- tive particle the discussion from the act of killing is conveyed to us.
yathā siddharūpadadhyanupraveśe 'pi na homasya sādhyamānāvasthā nivartate tathā nañanuviddhahantyarthāvagatau na pūrvāparībhāvabuddhir nivartate /	Though it qualifies the offering of an oblation and becomes thus related to it yet the offering of an oblation does not give up its cha- racter of being an action. Similarly, though the meaning of the root 'han' is known as related to negation, the meaning of the negative particle yet the qualified meaning is presented to our consciousness as arranged in the relation of being prior and posterior.
na hy abrāhmaṇavat [na hanyāt] iti siddharūpabuddhiḥ /	But when we hear the sentence "He shall not kill" it does not imply an accomplished thing.
so 'yaṃ hanananivṛttirūpaḥ pūrvāparībhūto 'rtho vidhiviṣayo bhavati // atha vā vibhaktyarthena nañ saṃbhantsyati /	Therefore the injunctive sentence "He shall not kill” enjoins an action, viz., dissuasion from killing.Nyayamanjari Or, negation will be related to the verbal termination indica- tive of lin (optative mood).
śuddhasya liṅāder arthaḥ pravartakaḥ nañupahitasya tasyārtho nivartaka iti śabdaśaktir evaiṣā vā 'paryanuyojyeti //	Pure optative verbal termination denotes an instigator. But if the negative particle is attached to it then it, being thus qualified, denotes dissuading something. This is the primary meaning of a word.
yat tu sākṣāt naño 'nantaraṃ vidhivibhaktir notpadyate tat tasyādhātu tvāt dhātoḥ pare tiṅādayaḥ pratyayā bhavanti nānyasmād iti /	Who is to be brought to book for this finding? 744 Optative verbal termination is not attached to the negative particle because the negative particle is not a root. Verbal ter- minations in all tenses and moods are attached only to roots but not to other words.
yogyatayā tu nañarthena tasya saṃbandhaḥ/ na ca tatrāyam artho 'vatiṣṭhate hananavidhir nāstīti /	As they are related so the boiled down meaning does not imply that there is no such injunction as en- joins killing. In the case of prohibitive injunction “He shall not kill" it does not induce a listener to an action.
kin tu nañupahito vidhir audāsīnye puruṣaṃ niyunkte /	He is only not induced to the act of killing.
tadavacchedakaś ca hantiḥ anyathā sarvakriyaudāsīnyaṃ pratīyetety alam ativimardena /	If one does not subscribe to this view then the listener will be indifferent to all sorts of actions.
niṣedhavidher api siddho 'nubandhadvayayogaḥ //	We shall no more criticise our rival hypothesis. Thus in the case of prohibitive injunction such an injunction has to essential factor, viz.
evaṃ niyogavyāpare samāpte phalakalpanā / nṛbuddhiprabhavaiva syāt ataḥ sāpekṣatā bhavet //	Thus when the implication of an injunction is fully discussed a person shall assume the result of a rite prescribed by the Vedas according to his imaginative power. Therefore, a rite enjoined by the Vedas should depend upon its result.
kathaṃ naro nivarteta pratyavāyabhayād vinā / mā nivartiṣṭa vidhinā tāvad uktaṃ nivartanam //	Why shall a person dissuade from an evil deed without the threat of sin? He may not of his own accord dissuade from it. So, prohibitive injunction lays down his dissuasion.
na nivarteta ity evaṃ kiṃ vidher apramāṇatā // phalaṃ bhavatu mā vā bhūt puruṣo 'pi pravartatām /	If this be the case then why will a prohibitive injunction prescribing dissuation be invalid ? An injunction may yield a result or not. A person may be inclined for killing or not.
mā praviṣṭa vā sve tu nāsty arthe khaṇḍanā vidheḥ // pravartanāvagamajanane hi vidhivyāpāra ity asakṛd uktam /	Its function cannot be interfered with.Injunctions and their scope It has been repeatedly said that an injunction operates to pro- duce the knowledge of instigation.
tatra cāsya na kiṃcid vaikalyam //	Therefore, an injuncton is never unsuccessful in its mission.
nanu vidheḥ phalāpekṣā nāsti cet kiṃ tarhi aśruyamāṇaphaleṣu viśvajidādiṣu svargādiphalaṃ kalpyate/	745 If an injunction does not depend upon the result of an ac- tion then why does a person assume the result of actions such as Visvajit sacrifice etc.
na tatra vidheḥ phalāpekṣā / na ca phalam tatra kalpyate / kin tu aśruyamāṇatvād adhikārānubandhasya niradhikārasya ca vidher vidhitvānirvāhāt adhikārānubandhaḥ kalpyate/	of which no result has been directly ex- pressed by the Vedas ? Moreover, if there is no mention of a fact or which is essentially required for a sacrifice, viz., a per- son who is qualified to perform a sacrifice then a person, quali- fied to perform a sacrifice, is assumed, otherwise an injunction ceases to be an injunction.
tatra sarvān praty aviśiṣṭatvāt svargakāmaḥ codanāśeṣabhāvena niyojyaḥ kalpyate /	As the same rule uniformly applies to all sacrifices so it is assumed that a person who desires heaven is qualified to perform a sacrifice.
na ceyaṃ pauruṣī kalpanā śrutyekadeśaḥ sa iti hi tadvidaḥ /	Do not think that the said assumption is of human origin. The Vedic scholars hold that it is a por- tion of the Vedic sentence.
tad iyam adhikārānubandhakalpanā na phalakalpanā iti so 'yam anubandhadvayāvacchinno niyogo vākyārthaḥ //	In fine, they say that the assump- tion of qualification is that of a relevant matter which is use- ful to a sacrifice. It is not the assumption of a result. The as- sumption of a qualification is not identical with that of a result.
vākyārthatvaṃ cāsya pradhānatvāt /	A mandate is called the meaning of a sentence owing to its importance.
anyo hi yajyādir artho 'vagamyamānaḥ tadanupraveśena pratīyata iti guṇo bhavati / niyogas tu svamahimākṣiptadṛṣṭopakārānekakriyākārakakalāpopabṛṃhitasvarūpaḥ pratīyata iti prādhānyam avalambate/	Though other matters, such as a sacrifice etc., are revealed by it yet they occupy a subordinate position since they become an object of our experience as the sphere of the work- ing of a mandate. But the mandate itself occupies the main position in a sentence since it is presented to our consciousness as strengthened by various rites and their causal factors having tangible result and being implied by its intrinsic power.
kāryaṃ cet pradhānam ucyate niyoga eva kāryam /	If it is held that the main thing is that which is accomplished then we shall say that a mandate is that which is accomplished.
phalaṃ cet pradhānam uyate[ucyate?] tad api na siddham api tu sādhyam / sādhyatvaṃ cāsya niyogādhīnam iti niyoga eva pradhānam / puruṣas tu niyojyamānavād apradhānam iti //	If one holds that an end occupies the most important place then this hypothesis is not disproved. But it is also to be noted that an end is to be realised and its realisation depends upon a man- date.
evaṃ niyoga eva pradhānatvāt vākyārthaḥ /	Hence, a mandate occupies the principal position.
sa ca pratītibhedaparyālocanayā caturavastha ucyate/	Of these four kinds let us cite example of the originative injunction.
utpattividhiḥ [agnihotraṃ juhoti] iti agnihotrākhyakarmasvarūpotpādavyatirekeṇārthāntarānavagamāt //	It conveys nothing but the origination of Agnihotra sacrifice itself. The illustration of the injunction of connection of the main rite with its accessory ones runs thus.
viniyogavidhiḥ [dadhnā juhoti] iti utpattividhitaḥ pratipanne bhāvārthe tatra dadhyādiguṇaviniyogāvagamāt //	The injunction:-"He shall sacrifice with sour milk" implies the connexion of the ac- cessories such as sour milk etc., with the main rite which has been conveyed by the originative injunction "He shall sacri- fice with milk".
adhikārividhiḥ [agnihotraṃ juhuyāt svargakāmaḥ] iti nirjñāte karmaṇi tatrādhikṛtasya puṃsas tato 'vagamāt // prayogavidhis tu yaḥ kramaparyantaṃ prayoge padārthān avagamayati /	When the rite is revealed by it the person who is qualified to do the rite is known in and through the said rite. This is only to be stated about the injunction of the due order of performance that all things useful in a sacrifice are known only when a rite is performed in due order up to its end.
ayaṃ cādhikāravidher eva vyāpāraviśeṣa iti tad evāsyodāharaṇam [agnihotraṃ juhyāt svargakāmaḥ] iti //	The exam- ple of the injunction of qualification is its illustration. The above-mentioned injunction "He who desires heaven shall perform Agnihotra sacrifice" illustrates it also.
kvacid ekasminn eva vākye rūpacatuṣṭayaṃ vidher avagamyate na tatra pṛthag udāharaṇam apekṣyate /	In some cases single injunctive sentence illustrates four different kinds of injunction. In those cases each kind of injunc- tion does not require a distinct sentence for its illustration.
yathā [etasyaiva revatīṣu vāravantīyam agniṣṭoma sāma kṛtvā paśukāmo hy etena yajeta] iti //	The illustration is as follows :-In Agnistut sacrifice a group of hymns, known as Väravantiya and sung in honour of Agni, is to be inserted into the Rk verses called Revati.
anyāny api niyogasya rūpāṇi vyāpārabhedād avagamyate /	The different kinds of injunctions are guessed by us from the diversity in the nature of actions themselves.
sa hi bhāvārthasiddhyarthaṃ tatsamartham artham ākṣipatīti tatprayojaka ucyate/	For this reason the injunction in question is called the determinant of the second injunction. Let us illustrate it.
yathā māṇavakasthasyādhyayanasyācāryakaraṇavidhiḥ //	The injunction of appointing a preceptor is implied by that of the study of Gayatri mantra by a Brahmin lad to be invested with sacred thread.
kvacid anyākṣipte vastuni labdhe sati tatrāprayojako vidhir bhavati yathā krayaniyuktaikahāyinyā lābhe sati na pādapāṃsugrahaṇārthaṃ anyām ekahāyanīm ākṣipati vidhir iti prakaraṇapaṭhitapadārthapaṭalaparigrahāc ca grāhaka iti vidhir ucyate //	747 The different forms of injunction In some cases, if a thing is got in order to realise another object then an injunction does not imply another similar thing which is a helpful means to an action, laid down by the Vedas. Let us illustrate our point. A young she-calf one year old is taken to a sacrificial place for sale and is purchased and got.
kvacit prakaraṇapaṭhitasyāpi tenāgṛhītasya dvādaśopasadādeḥ prakaraṇād utkarṣadarśanāt ata eva niyogagarbho viniyoga ity ācakṣate //	In a particular context though an injunction refers to many matters yet it does not include a particular rite viz., twelve upasads (12 libations in an ektype sacrifice of the Archetype Jyoti toma). Noticing their excellence they are included in this context from another context.
kvacid viniyojakaśrutyādipramāṇavirahe 'pi paśvekatvādyupādānaṃ śeṣīkuruvann upādāyaka ity ucyate /	The Different Forms of Injunction In some cases even in spite of the absence of the evidence of an applicatory injunction settling connection between a sub- sidiary act and its principal injunction which indicates theNyayamanjari connection of the single number of an animal as subsidiary with the seizing of an animal as its principal one is called upadāyaka.
[paśunā yajeta] iti vibhaktyā hi prātipadikārtho viniyuktaḥ/	Let us take an illustration: One should sacrifice with an animal (paśunâ yajeta).
tatsthaṃ tv ekatvam eva na viniyuktaṃ [ekena] ity aśravaṇāt paśur upādīyamāno na saṃkhyārahita upādātuṃ śakyate / śrutasaṃkhyāparityāgakāraṇābhāvāc ca ekatvaviśiṣṭaḥ paśur upādīyata ity upādānata śeṣīkṛtam ekatvam //	The singular number of the third case-ending attached to pašu does not enjoin that the number of the said animal should be one. It simply enjoins that an animal, the meaning of the basic stem (pašu), should only be taken into consideration since the number one of the animal has been already enjoined. The number one has not been enjoined here because the said number has not been men- tioned in the injunctive sentence.
vaikṛtas tu sauryādividhiḥ prākṛtam itikartavyatājātam ākarṣaś codaka ity ucyate /	As it draws all manners of performance belonging to archetypal rite towards its own rite so it is called 'codaka,' i.e., the rule of transfer.

We shall no more discuss the subject-matter of the Mimāṁsā literature, the theatre of intellectual feats of the great leaders of thought.

amuṣmann api vākyārthe vivadante manīṣiṇaḥ / liṅāder avagamyamānaḥ kāryarūpaḥ preraṇātmā ca vākyārtho niyoga ity uktam /	The great thinkers differ from one another in the above-mentioned meaning of a sentence.749 Knowledge of an end as the motive of action The establishment of the hypothesis that the knowledge of an end is the motive of one's action It has been stated that a sentence conveys an injunction which is presented to our consciousness by him, etc, and the in- junction itself is an act to be accomplished and an embodi- ment of instigation.
na cāsav evaṃrūpo 'pi paridṛśyamānabhāvārthādivyatirikto 'vagamyate //	Though it may be so yet we do not grasp it to be distinct from human activities which are being experi- enced by us.
kriyaiva tāvad kāryātmā preraṇātmā phalārthitā /	An act is apprehended by us to be such as leads us on to an end because it is that which is to be accomplished and which stirs our movement.
pratīyate tato 'nyas tu niyogo nobhayātmakaḥ //	But if an injunction is other than an act then it cannot partake of the above two characters of an act.
nanu anya eva kriyākartṛsaṃbandhāt praiṣapraiṣyasambandho hi darśitaḥ /	The Mimâmsakas have already shown that the relation which subsists between an act and an agent is distinct from that holding between the director and the directed.
kuryād ityādiśabdebhyaḥ kriyādivyatirekiṇaḥ / nārthāntarasya saṃvittiḥ kasyacit preraṇātmaṇaḥ //	The said contention of the Mimāṁsakas does not stand to reasons. The verbs 'should do' etc. purport to convey no instigation which is other than an act itself.
kim idānīṃ [karoti] [kuryāt] ityādi ca tulye ete pratipattī / abhinavam idaṃ śabdajñatvam āyuṣmataḥ/	The Mīmāṁsakas raise an objection to this effect. Do the verbs, 'does' and 'should do' etc., convey the same sense ? Oh long-lived one ! your knowledge of etymology is novel.
na brūmo na bhinne ete pratipattī iti /	We do not hold that the senses, conveyed by these two verbs, are not different from each other.
[karoti] iti pravṛttakriya ucyate vartamānakālāvacchinnaś ca /	The verb 'does' communicates to us an act which has commenced and persists in the present time.
kiṃ tv asau praiṣaḥ tato 'vagamyamāno 'pi prerako na bhavati na ca kārya iti brūmaḥ // nanu prerakatvenaivāvagamyamānaḥ kathaṃ prerako na bhavet/	But though it conveys an instigation yet it does neither cause one to move for it nor indicate that one should do it. If it is communicated to us as a director then why does not it cause us to do it? It should have caused us to do it.
etad evāsya praiṣatvam yat prerakatvam/ satyam/ prerakatvenaivāsau gamyate /	As it contains an element of instigation in it so it acts as an instigator. It is a truism that the said act is presented to our consciousness as an instigator.
na tv asau tahtā bhavati/	But in reality it does not act as an instigator.
vyavahāramātram etat [rājājñayā karomi] iti / kāryatvam apy asya prakriyāmātraṃ [rājājñāṃ karomi] iti //	The sentence "I obey the order of a king" implies that to obey the order of a king is an act which is accomplished by me.750 An order is that which is known to be carried out by others.
ājñā hi nāma naivānyā saṃpādyatvena gamyate /	He who obeys an order does not think that it should be carried out.
nānuṣṭhātur iyaṃ buddhiḥ ājñā saṃpādyatām iti //	Though a sentence conveys instiga- tion yet intelligent persons do not undertake an action, hearing sentences, uttered by young boys, or insane persons etc.
evaṃ hi yasya kasyāpi pravarteta sa ājñayā /	In the above matter such a conclusion may be entertained.
na ceha vālonmattādivacanāt phalavarjitāt // saty api preraṇājñāne pravartante sacetasaḥ / bhayaṃ nāśaṅkyate yasmāt phalaṃ vāpi samīhitam //	In ordinary worldly transactions a person may undertake an action out of desire for fruit or in accordance with the intention of a director. In these cases an end is the remote or indirect cause of movement. The origin of the Vedas cannot be traced to a human being-a speaker.
tathāvidhasya rājño 'pi nājñā 'nuṣṭhīyate janaiḥ / vartamānāpadeśe 'pi phalaṃ yatrāvagamyate //	So, when a person listens to the sentences of the Vedas he undertakes an action, being inspired by the knowledge of instigation.
bhavaty ārogyasaṃpattiḥ bhuṃjānasya harītakīm // tatkāmo bhakṣayec ceti ko viśeṣaḥ pravartane /	But if a person listens to the sentences of a mad man containing verbs in the optative tense, he does not feel that he is inspired by them to do something.
anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ tad evam anumanyate /	So, the above sentences are disregarded as incoherent talks.
vede tv vaktur abhāvāt preraṇāvagamād eva pravṛttiḥ //	But in the case of the Vedas as a person hears the injunctive sentence "One should sacrifice" so he feels inspired to undertake the enjoined act.
unmattavākyād api liṅādiyuktāt na preraṇāvagamo nāsti /	There is no reason to set his inspiration at naught.
vede punaḥ [yajeta] ity atra preraṇāvagamāt parityāgakāraṇābhāvāt tata eva pravartanam/	Hence, he engages himself in undertaking the enjoined act.
pravartanābhāve 'pi na vedasyāprāmāṇyam pramāṇavyāpārasya tena nirvartitatvād ity uktam //	The Vedas are not the source of invalid knowledge because the author of751 Knowledge of an end as the motive of action the Vedas is not a director.

tadāśayavaśena tatrāpi phalārthināṃ pravartanam iti saṃbhavad apīdam uttaraṃ nācakṣmahe kathāntaraprasaṅgāt/	A person who has desire for fruit undertakes an act in accordance with the intention of the said author.

adhikārānubandhābhidhāne puruṣaviśeṣaṇamātram etat bhavatu kiṃ svargasādhyakatvakalpanayā /	As the feeling of inspiration establishes one's movement for an action so the compound word 'Svargakāmaḥ' should be interpreted in a different sense, following the foot- steps of Badari.
viśeṣaṇatvam evānyathā na nirvahatīti cet āyātaṃ tarhi phalasya sādhyatvam /	(It has been suggested that desire for fruit does not stir one's movement). Let the compound word simply.
tac cet sādhyatvenāvagamyate tasyaiva sāmarthyasiddokānuguṇam avyabhicāri ca pravartakatvam utsṛjya na preraṇāvagamasya tad vaktum arhasīti //	But we object to the supposition that supreme bliss is an end since it is gratuitous. Now, one may argue that if supreme bliss is not an end then the compound word 'Svargakāmaḥ' cannot be an adjective of a sacrificer.
niyogād atha niṣpattiḥ phalasyety abhidhīyate /	The import of this argument is this that the result of an action is the end to be realised.
phalaṃ praty aṅgabhūtatvāt avākyārthatvam āpateta / nanu vidhyartho na bhāvārthavat phale karaṇaṃ yenāsya tadaṅgatvaṃ syāt /	Moreover, it knows no exception. So there is no reason why we should discard it and subscribe to the conjecture that the feeling of inspiration prompts us to an action. If you admit that an order points to a result then the result itself occupies the principal position in a sentence.
ākṣepikatvāt tu tasya phalārthatvam ucyate /	But as a result is implied by the meaning of an injunction so it is held that an injunction is meant for a result.
prayoktṛtvaṃ hi tasya nijaṃ rūpam yady evaṃ bhāvārtha eva sādhyo bhavatu /	If you subscribe752 to this hypothesis then let the meaning of the root 'yaj' be the object to be accomplished.
vidhyarthasya tu kim anuṣṭheyatvam ucyate /	In that case why do you say that an order, the meaning of an injunctive sentence, is an object to be accomplished? Now, the Mimamsakas may contend on the basis of the current verbal practice that an order is completed when a sacrifice, the meaning of the root 'yaj' is performed.
so 'pi bhāvārthasiddhyā saṃpadyate [kṛto mayā svāminiyogaḥ] iti vyavahārād iti vyavahārād iti cet bhāvārthāt tarhi niṣpattiḥ niyogasya phalasya ca / ity ekatra padagrāme vākyārthadvayam āpatet //	There runs a verbal usage "I am completing the order of my master." If this is their contention then our counter-argument runs thus 1f the meaning of a root completes both an order, the meaning of an injunctive sentence, and a result then the sente- nce in question is open to the charge of syntactic disunity.
kiṃ cānvitābhidhānena viṣayatvāvadhāraṇāt /	(If a sentence refers to two independent substantives then the split- ting up of a sentence into two is inevitable).
niyogasyaiva bhāvārthaniṣpādyatvaṃ pratīyate // sa tu bhāvārthataḥ siddhaḥ phalāya yadi kalpyate /	Now, if we assume that an order is carried out by a sacrifice, the meaning of the basic root then we admit that an order be- comes a means to an end, viz. the result.
parārthatvād avākyārtho bhaved ity upavarṇitam //	Thus, as it is an accessory matter serving the purpose of another so it is not the principal import of a sentence. This point has been discussed before.
bhāvārthas tu dvayaṃ kuryāt yugapad vā krameṇa vā /	Now, it may be suggested that a sacrifice completes two things viz., an order and a result.
yugapan nāsya sāmartyaṃ samatvaṃ ca dvayor bhavet //	If it had such capacity then they would have been identical.
niyogaś ca śabdaikagocaratvāt mā darśi phalaṃ tu svargapaśvādi tena saha niśpadyamānaṃ kim iti na gṛhyate /	One may not see an order since it is conveyed only by a ver- bal statement. But why will not one see that it is completed along with the ultimate result viz., heaven, animal etc ? Let the second alternative suggestion of successiveness be admitted.

Or, does the completion of the result precede and is a result completed afterwards? If it is held that an order is completed at the out-set then why should a man move for accessory matters which are means to a sacrifice?753 Knowledge of an end as the motive of action Just as by performing fire-sacrifices a mandate concerning Darsa and Paurṇamāsa sacrifices is completed but the enjoined matter which remains unfinished is completed in accordance with the direction of the Sastras as a sacrificer may also move for the completion of the accessory matters of a sacrifice in con- formity with the direction of the Sastras even after the execution of an order.
iṣyate eveti cet nanv evaṃ tasya lipsārthalakṣaṇety abhyadhāyi yat / śyenādīnām adharmatvaṃ varṇitaṃ tad viruddhyate //	If this is their contention then we say in reply "O Mīmāṁsakas! as the activities of a human being are directed towards the attainment of the highly desired end owing to his natural appetites so they do not come within the province of injunction.
atha pūrvaṃ phalasiddhiḥ tato niyogasiddhiḥ tarhi phalasya tadānīṃ darśanaṃ bhavet siddhatvāt // na ca bhāvārthavelāyāṃ putrapaśvādi dṛśyate /	If the Mimāṁsakas contend that the result is at first establish- ed and the order which concerns it is completed then the in- admissible logical consequence that the result, being established before the completion of the said order, should be visible be- comes inevitable When a sacrifice has been duly performed the promised fruit viz., a son, animals etc., is not tangibly obtained.
adṛśyamānam apy etat siddhavimativismayaḥ //	If it is held that though the result remains inevitable yet it is established then such a conclusion is absolutely mysterious.
ataś ca kaiścid uccate svargasiddhim avāntaravyāpārīkṛtya niyogam eva bhāvārthaḥ saṃpādayatīti tad apy apāstam /	Some Mimāṁsakas contend that a sacrifice, the meaning of the root, completes an order through the operation of the unimportant intermediate process viz., the establishment of heaven etc. This contention also stands refuted.
avāntaravyāpārasya jvalanāder iva pradhānavyāpārāt pūrvaṃ darśanaprasaṅgād iti //	As the minor operation of fire, viz., the act of blazing, at first, takes place before its main operation in the shape of the act of cooking so the minor operation, viz., the establishment of heaven, should be at first experienced.
athocyate svargakāmasya svargaṃ sādhayitum udyacchato yāge niyogaḥ yaḥ saṃpādya śrūyate sa cet saṃpannaḥ śabdavṛttena phalam api saṃpannam eva / ānubhāvikī tu svargādisiddhiḥ kālāntare bhaviṣyatīti etad ayuktam siddhidvayānupalaṃbhāt /	So it is learnt from the texts that an order, the meaning of verbal termination indicating optativę mood should be at first executed. Now, if the said order is completely carried out then we are given to understand by verbal authority that the result, viz., heaven, has also been produced. The establish- ment of heavenly bliss will be certified by experience in the754 future: Such a contention does not stand to reasons.
na hy ekā śābdī siddhiḥ anyā cānubhāvikī phalasiddhiḥ kutastyeti cintyam //	We fail to make out what is the genesis of the hypothesis that heaven will be established in the future by means of experience.
kālāntare ca bhāvārthaḥ kṣaṇikatvān na vidyate / śaktyādirūpaṃ cāpūrvaṃ na bhavadbhir upeyate //	The act of sacrifice is short-lived. It does not endure in the future. You (the particular sect of Mimãmsakas) do not admit the existence of transcendental result in the shape of some power etc.
bhavanto hy apūrvaśabdena dharmaśabdena ca niyogam evopacaranti /	You hold that the words ‘apūrva' and 'dharma' denote an order by means of their secondary meaning.
na ca niyogaḥ śaktivat ātmasaṃskāravad vā kālāntarasthāyī bhavatī / sa hi preraṇātmakaḥ kāryarūpo vā nobhayathāpi sthairyam avalambhate //	But an order does not endure long like power or like an impression belonging to the soul. Is an order an embodiment of instigation ? Or, is it a result itself? What do you say? Let an order be either of them. But none of them lasts long.
tatraitat syāt niyogasiddhiḥ ākṣiptaphalasiddhir bhavati /	If an impression that ob- edience to such an order brings up the result takes hold of the mind then an order implies a result.
viṣayādyanubandhāvacchinno hy asāv evānuṣṭheyaḥ /	It is characterised by the object. It is obeyed because it has a concrete shape.
tatra yathā tena tena kārakacakreṇa kriyākalāpena vinā saṃpattim alabhamānaḥ tat tad ākṣipati tathādhikārānubandhavandhyo 'pi nāsau saṃpattim adhigacchatīti tam apy ākṣipati /	An act is not accomplished if the necessary conditions do not assemble and the requisite in- termediary processes do not make their contribution. Hence, an act implies them all. Similarly, an order cannot be executed if the person who is duly qualified to perform the act is not men- tioned.
yaś cāyam adhikārānubandhākṣepaḥ sa evāyaṃ phalākṣepeṇa tu vidheḥ phalākṣepitety uktam /	When an order is qualified by the implied person it points to the result of an act. Hence, the result of an act is assumed.
niyojyamātreākṣepe tu niyogo na phalātmakaḥ //	But an injunction does not require a result. But the above statement does not stand to reasons.
niyojyaḥ caṇḍālasparśaneneva svargakāmanotpādamātreṇa niyojyatāṃ pratipanna iti kathaṃ niyojyākṣepa eva phalākṣepaḥ /	But though an injunction implies a person duly quali- fied to perform an act yet it cannot be held to imply the result of an act. As soon as a person touches an impure candâla he becomes instantaneously impure.
nanu ca svargakāmo 'tra niyojyo nānyathā bhavet /	Therefore, the assumption of such a person is not arriv- ed at by implication.
yadi svargasya saṃpattiṃ nādhigacchet svakarmaṇaḥ // naitad evam narecchāmātram evedaṃ na śabdas tv iyati kṣamaḥ /	He is not a qualified person if he cannot inanage to attain heavenly bliss by dint of his own act. The solution of the problem as offered by the Mīmāṁsakas is not satisfactory.
niyojyaḥ svargakāmo hi bhavej jīvanavān iva //	A person who desires heaven is only directed to perform a sacrifice just as a living person is only directed but not a dead one.
nanu loke kāmyamānasya sādhyatvaṃ dṛṣṭam [harītakīṃ bhakṣayed ārogyakāmaḥ] iti / tena vede 'pi [yajeta svargakāmaḥ] iti svargasya sādhyatvam avabhotsyāmahe / sādho loke 'pi katham etad avagatam āyuṣmatā niyojyasamarpakapadavācyaparyālocanena vidhivṛttaparīkṣayā vā /	In this case the taking of myrobalan is our end. Similarly, in the ease of a Vedic rite enjoined by the passage "A person who desires, heaven shall sacrifice" heaven is our goal, O gentle one; how have you found out that the same law applies to secular matters to determine the goal? The goal is discovered when we either reflect on the primary meaning of a word denoting the qualified person or discuss the intrinsic character of an injunction.
padārthas tāvad etāvān evaṃ cāto hy asāv iti /	The meaning of a word is such. Or this person desires it to be so.
idaṃ tu siddhyaty etasmād iti tasya na gocaraḥ //	Why do you think in this way? It does not come within the province of an injunction.
vidher eṣa svabhāvaś cet āyuṣman sādhu budhyase / bhāṭṭaiḥ kim aparāddhaṃ te nitye 'pi phalavādibhiḥ // adhikāryanupādeyaviśeṣaṇaviśeṣitaḥ /	O long-lived one! If you think that it follows from the intrinsic nature of an injunction then why do you heap censure on Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, because he holds that a permanent obligatory rite yields a result? No adjective has been given to the agent of an optional rite or to that of an unconditionally obligatory rite in order to distinguish him.
jīvan vā svargakāmo 'pitsamānaḥ kāmyanityayoḥ //	All persons who may be living or desirous of heaven are equally qualified to perform optional or such obligatory rites.
vidhivīryaprabhavas tu dvayor api tathāvidhaḥ /	The same rule applies to a categorically obligatory rite. The influence of an injunction upon an insect is the same.
sapratyayaprerakatāṃ vidhir nopaiti niṣphalaḥ //	An injunction does not instigate an intelligent person to perform an act, being threatened with the fear of being fruitless.
nanu kāmanādhikāre svargaḥ śrūyate nityādhikāre tv asau na śrūyate /	In the case of an optional rite it has been directly stated that the goal of this act is heaven but in the case of a standing obligatory rite no such goal has been directly mentioned.
āśryamāṇaḥ kasyānurodhena kalpyate vidher eveti brūhaḥ /	On the strength of which authority has an end of such an obligatory rite been assumed? The Naiyāyikas give a reply to this objection.
svargeṇa śrutenāpi kiṃ kariṣyati yady asau vidhinā nāpekṣyata [ghṛtakulyā asya bhavanti] ityādivat aśruto 'pi cāsau vidhinā [kṛṣyata eva tasmāt vidhir evātra pramāṇaṃ na śravaṇāśravaṇe iti kāmyavan nitye 'pi phalam abhyupagantavyam na vā kvacid apīti //	They hold that it is the very injunction which leads us to such an assumption. The mention of heaven'is of no use to us if an in- junction does not require it. An injunction attracts an unheard. fruit in the shape of heaven and requires it as its essential ele- ment just as it appropriates the fruit mentioned in the passage.
pratiṣedhādhikāre 'pi vidhivṛttaparīkṣayā /	"He has become possessed of streams of clarified butter".
evaṃ narakapātādiphalayogo na durbhaṇaḥ //	Hence aninjunction is the sole authority in the matter whether an action bears a fruit or not.
tasmān nityeṣu pratyavāyaparihāra iva upāttaduritakṣava iva vā pratiṣidhyamāneṣu karmasu narakapātaḥ phalam ity abhyupagamanīyam / itarathā hy arthānarthaviveko na siddhyati /	If a standing obligatory rite bears no fruit then we shall hold that both optional and per- manent rites alike shall bear no fruit. In the light of discussions concerning an injunction it will not be inconsistent to hold that if a person performs any prohibited action then he gets punishment in the shape of sufferings.
evaṃ ca brahmahatyāder api naivāsty adharmatā / kiṃ punaḥ śyenavajrāder ity arthagrahaṇaṃ vṛthā //	A person with his conscience clouded by unbearably oppressing hatred considers the slaying of a Brahmin to be his duty since he thinks that the said act is conducive to pleasure.
karaṇāṃśe 'pi lipsātaḥ pravṛttir yady upeyate /	A person has also believed that alcoholic drinks are also conducive to.
itikartavyatāṃśe tu śāstrād yadi tad apy asat //	Thus the term 'artha' in the definition of dharma becomes meaningless, If the Mimāṁsakas hold that a person moves for the means owing to his natural propensities but observes the procedure of performance, being inspired by the scriptural passages then their view is not sound.
na hi tatkaraṇaṃ śuddhaṃ svaphalāyopakalpate /	Because means, unaided by the manners of procedure, cannot produce the intended result viz., heaven.
setikartavyatākaṃ hi karaṇaṃ karaṇaṃ viduḥ // avāntaravibhāga evaiṣaḥ karaṇetikartavyatālakṣaṇaḥ /	formance, is really a means par The division of the conditions of a sacrifice into two different heads viz., (1) Karaṇa (means) and (2) Itikartavyatā (manners of performance) is a very minor one.
sakalāṅgo bṛṃhitasvarūpas tu bhāvārthaḥ kāmyamānopāyatāṃ pratipadyate naikenāpy aṃśena nyūnaḥ /	But if a sacrifice is per- formed with the completion of all its subsidiary actions then and then only it leads to the desired goal. But if a single subsidiary action is omitted then the sacrifice does not produce its result.
ata eva kāmyānāṃ karmānāṃ sarvāṅgopasaṃhāreṇa prayogam icchanti /	Therefore, if we are to perform an optional rite then we must be particularly mindful of the performance of all subsidiary rites without an exception.
tasmāt karaṇavad itikartavyatāyām api lipsāta eva pravṛttiḥ syāt //	Hence, one should move for the manners of performance out of mere desire for the attainment of goal as he does for the means.
ubhayatrāpi lipsātaḥ sati caivaṃ pravartane / agnīṣomīyahiṃsādeḥ śyenādivad adharmatā //	If in both cases pure desire of result is the sine qua-non of his movement then the killing of an animal in connection with the sacrifice dedicated to Agni and Soma should be considered as a sinful act just like the Syena sacrifice.
yad apy uktaṃ kāmādhikāreṣu kāmyamānabhāvārthayor upāyopeyabhāvamātrapratipādanaparyavasito vidhivyāpāra iti tad api na samyak /	Moreover, it has been stated by the Mimāṁsakas that in the case of an optional rite the operation of an injunction amounts to the relation of a means to an end holding between a sacrifice and its result. The above statement is not correct.
vidhipuruṣayor hi preryaprerakabhāvalakṣaṇaḥ saṃbandhaḥ /	The relation subsisting between an injunction and a sacrifice is that of the inducer and the induced.
tatra yāgādayo viṣayatvena pratīyante neṣyamāṇopāyatvena /	But the desired result is not known to us as a means to heaven.
sādhyasādhanamātrapratipādanaparyavasitavyāpāras tu vidhiḥ viniyogapara eva syāt /	Again, if it is held that the only operation of an injunc- tion is to reveal causal relation then the view virtually leads to the conclusion that an injunction enjoins that this is the means and that this is the end.
tataś cāpravṛttapravartakaṃ nāma nijaṃ rūpaṃ jahyāt //	In that case an injunction should giveNyayamanjari 758 up its own intrinsic character of inducing one to movement one who has not as yet moved for an action.
vidheś caturavasthatvaṃ phalataḥ kila kathyate /	There is a well-known saying that an injunction has four different modes.
prerakatvaṃ ca tadrūpaṃ sarvāvasthānugāmi yat //	But its basic character of being an instigator underlies all of them.
kāryātmatā 'pi vidhyarthe preraṇājñaptipūrvikā /	An injunction at first communicates its incentive to an enjoined rite and then informs that the above act is an obliga- tory duty.
preryeṇaiva satā puṃsā tatkāryam avadhāryate //	A person who is induced to perform this rite scruti- nizes his duty minutely.
liṅgādiśrutitaś cādau preraṇaiva pratīyate /	Now, the Mimāṁsakas take an exception to the above suggestion and point out some defects in it.
sādhyasādhanasaṃbandhabuddhis tadbuddhipūrvikā //	This is the sum and substance of the said suggestion.
nanv evaṃ kāmyaṣu vidhitaḥ pravṛttāv iṣyamāṇāyāṃ apravartamānaḥ pratyaveyāt vidhyatikramāt /	But if some body does not undertake an action then he shall commit the sin of omission since he has transgressed an injunction. Such an objection does not hold good.
maivam svargaṃ siṣādhayiṣoḥ tatrādhikārāt /	A person who desires heaven is qualified to perform a rite.
anyas tv anadhikṛta eva kṣatriyādir iva vaiśyastome / nāsāv akurvan pratyavāyam arhati /	A Vaiśya should recite a group of verses. But if a Kşatriya does not recite those verses, he does not commit the sin of omission.
svargārthī tu vidhitaḥ pravartata eva /	But the person who desires heaven undertakes to perform a rite, being induced by an injunction.
lipsayā tu karaṇāṃśe pravṛttir iṣyamāṇā kratvartham itikartavyatāṃśam api maivaṃ spṛśet / kratūpakārakāmo hi tatra pravartate ity evaṃ sarvatra vidhir utsīded evety alaṃ prasaṅgena //	If one admits that movement for a means owes its origin to desire then his activities for manners of pro- cedure of performance will be held to be due to desire also since he has moved for it, being inclined to render assistance to the said sacrifice. Thus, an injunction should be defunct in all matters.

Moreover, how do you hold that an injunction is the import of a sentence since a meaning is ascertained from usage ? The Mimāṁsakas have said the following: One has direct experience that his voluntary activities spring from his desires. So it is natural for him to infer that such activities of another person also spring from his desires.
ayuktam idam svātmany api preraṇāvagamanimittābhāvāt / na hy atmeva saṃvid iva preraṇāvagamanimittābhāvāt preraṇāsvaprakāśā /	Such an inference is not justifiable. One cannot be conscious of his own inspirationKnowledge of an end as the motive of action 759 since there is nothing to reveal it. An instigation is not self- luminous like its own consciousness.
preraṇāsaṃvit svaprakāśeti cet tadutpāde tarhi nimittaṃ tāvad mṛgyam /	If the Mimāṁsakas contend that the awareness of instigation is self-luminous then we ask them 'what is its cause?' Its cause is to be found out by scrutiny.
na tāvac chabdaḥ tadānīṃ vyupattyabhāvāt /	If the Mimāṁsakas hold that the optative mood communicates it then we point out that this view is not tenable.
svātmani preraṇāvagamapūrvikāṃ hi ceṣṭām upalabdhavataḥ te paratra ceṣṭādarśanāt tadanumānaṃ setsyati / tannimittaṃ liṅgādiś śabda iti bhotsyate sa punar vyutpattikāle svātmany eva preraṇāvagamaś cintyo vartate /	When a liste- ner hears an injunctive sentence how has he learnt that the optative mood denotes instigation? As one is aware of the fact that his own activities are preceded by the awareness of instiga- tion so it is an inference that the activities of another person are preceded by the awareness of instigation.
pramāṇāntarāt tu tadavagama iti cet uttiṣṭha asiddhaṃ śabdaikagocaratvam //	Thus we shall understand that verbal terminations, indicative of optative mood, communicate instigation.
yā ceyaṃ pūrvāvadhāritasukhasādhanabhāve kapitthādau svātmani pravṛttir upalabdhā tatra prerakatvena phalārthitā nirjñātā nānyā kācit preraṇā /	It has also been settled that desire of pleasure is the motive of our activity. There is no other motive which prompts us to activity. Some thinkers have said to this effect that worldly transactions are due to desire which is based upon recollection since everybody is aware of his own desire for fruits.
tad uktam [smaraṇād abhilāṣeṇa vyavahāraḥ pravartate] / iti /	Some thinkers other than the Naiyāyikas assume that a sentence communicates instigations.
phalaviśayā hīcchā tatra svasaṃvedyā // ataś ca prerakajñānaṃ śabdād api parasya yat / kalpyate kalpyatāṃ tatra prerikā saiva sundarī //	But it is also true beyond the shadow of a doubt that desire for a fruit is the real motive in such cases. If the fruit of an action induces a person to take upon himself an undertaking then the objections, raised before, will be met.
kathaṃ tarhy evam ācaṣṭe [ācāryacodito 'haṃ juhomi] iti / astv ayaṃ vyapadeśa /	If the earlier statement is true then how can one say "I am pouring libation at the instance of my preceptor ?" Let us set aside such a popular remark.
ācāryacodanā tu na tatra kāraṇam api tu hitāhitaprāptiparihārārthitvam evety ataḥ phalaṃ pravartakaṃ yuktam anubhavasākṣikatvāt //	In the above case the preceptor does not induce him to action. But the desire of gaining good or that of avoiding an evil is the prime condition of his move- ment. Hence, it is reasonable to hold that the fruit of an action760 is the real motive.
ye 'pi āhuḥ prayoktrāśayasya pravartakatvam yato 'nanuvidheyasya vacanāt na pravartamānaḥ kaścid dṛśyate / anuvidheyasya puṃsaḥ kiṃcid abruvato 'pi bhrūbhaṅgādinā [śayam avagamya pravartata iti etad apy ayuktam yataḥ prayoktrāśayānumānena svārthasaṃbhāvanayā lokaḥ pravartate /	Our experience bears witness to the truth of this hypothesis. Moreover, some other thinkers have suggested that the intention of a director is the prompter since nobody undertakes an action at the instance of a person who has not won the former's heart by his personal charms. But if the fellow is captivated by his personal charms then he reads the intention of his idol from the latter's browbeat, etc., but not from his words and takes up an action.
na punaḥ prayoktaiva prīyatām iti /	He does not undertake an action with the consideration.
tatprītir api svaprītihetutvenārthyate na tatprītitvena /	But if the pleasure of his director is the source of his own pleasure then he may desire the pleasure of his director as the source of his own pleasure.
buddho 'pi hi nāma sakalasattvahitaṃ pratipannaḥ parārthaṃ svaprayojanatayaiva saṃpādayati /	Lord Buddha himself who was bent upon doing good to all embraced altruism as his own interest since to render service to others was his self-interest.
tasmāt svaprītir eva pravartikā /	Hence one's own pleaure is the motive.
prayoktrāśayasya ca pravartakatve vedārthaprayoktrāśayānavadhāraṇāt apravṛttir eva prāpnoti /	If the Mimâmsakas hold that the intention of the director induces one to an action. then they should admit that there is no director in the Vedas since they say that the Vedas have not been composed by an author.
tasmāt phalam eva pravartakam //	Hence, the fruit of an action is the only motive.
yat punaḥ phalasya prerakatve dūṣaṇam abhyadhāyi siddhyasiddhavikalpānupapatter iti tad apy ayuktam icchāviṣayīkṛtasya pravartakatvābhyupagamāt /	The Mimāṁsakas have raised a few objections against the said hypothesis. They have put forward a dilemma to invalidate it. Is the fruit an accomplished fact or not? They believe that this riddle cannot be solved.
asiddhe kathaṃ kāmaneti cet asiddhatvād eva / idānīṃ ca tad asiddhaṃ naikāntāsiddhasvarūpam eva khapuṣpavat // sukhe duḥkhanivṛttau vā puṃsāṃ bhavati kāmanā / na punar vyomapuṣpādi kaścid kāmayate naraḥ //	If the unaccomplished fruit of an action is our motive then why is not an unreal object our motive? The Naiyãyikas say by way of reply that an object which is absolutely unreal like the sky- flower cannot be our motive.Knowledge of an end as the motive of action A man desires pleasure or cessation from pain but nobody longs for a purely imaginary object like the sky-flower.
ye 'pi rāgādeḥ pravartakatvam abhyupagatavantaḥ tair api kāmanāviṣayīkṛtaṃ phalam eva pravartakam abhyupagatam / icchāviśeṣā eva hi rāgādayaḥ //	Those who hold that love is the motive have in their mind the view that the object, longed for, has the prompting force since love is a form of desire. 761 Some thinkers hold that an object which is conducive to our welfare instigates us to action.
yad api śreyaśādhakatvaṃ pravartakam ucyate tad api na cāru satyām api śreyaśādhanatāyāṃ anarthitvena pravṛttyabhāvāt // nanu arthino 'pi nāniyataviṣayā pravṛttiḥ api tu nirjñātaśreyaśādhanabhāve bhāvārthe /	The reason behind our criticism is this that we do not move for an object which we do not long for though it is conducive to our welfare. Now, the Mimāṁsakas contend that a person who is in need of something does not move for an indefinite object. But he moves for an object which he definitely knows to be conducive to welfare.
tasmāt tatsādhanatāvagamaḥ pravartakaḥ /	Hence, the determination that this means will surely lead to goal is the real motive.
satyam /	This is true.
dvaye saty apīcchaiva pravartikā vaktuṃ yuktā tasyāṃ satyām eva pravṛttidarśanāt /	But if the knowledge of the sure means and the desire of fruit assemble then the latter should be called motif.
pravṛttir hi nāma prayatnaḥ /	Because movement for an object springs from desire.
prayatnaś cecchākārya iti kāṇādāḥ /	The followers of Kaņāda hold that conation is the effect of desire.
viṣayaniyame tu śreyaśādhanatvaṃ kāraṇaṃ na pravṛttyutpāde //	Conduciveness to welfare de- termines the acceptability or the otherwiseness of an object but does not stir movement.
kiṃ ca bhāvanāvagataṃ śreyaśādhanatvaṃ pravartakam iṣyate taiḥ /	It has been also suggested that conduc- iveness to welfare which is intimated by efficient force is the motive.
tac ca na pṛthag abhidhātuṃ yuktam /	The distinct mention of this motive is not logically ten- able.
bhāvanāyāḥ tryaṃśatvena tatsvarūpānugamasamaye etadaṃśayoḥ svargayāgayoḥ sādhyasādhanabhāvāvagatisiddheḥ /	Efficient force consists of three elements. When we appre- hend its distinct feature we determine that the relation of means to its end holds between a sacrifice and heaven, the two ele- ments of bhāvanā (efficient force).
na cāṃśadvayāvacchinnasya vyāpārasya śreyaśādhanatvaṃ rūpaṃ vaktum ucitam aniṣpannasya tasya tādrūpyābhāvāt /	It should not be held that the activity as characterized by these two elements is conducive to welfare. As bhāvanā has not as yet come into being so its property, viz., conduciveness to welfare, cannot come into ex- istence.
na hy aniṣpanne gavi tadekadeśasāsnādau gotvarūpaṃ sāmānyaṃ niviśate /	If a cow is not born then the universal of cowness does not belong to its limbs, viz., dewlap, etc.
na cāṃśatrayapūraṇam antareṇa bhāvanākhyavyāpāraniṣpattir iti //	If the three ele- ments are not fulfilled then the activity of a person, called bhāvanā, does not come into being.
yat tu liṅādeś śabdsya tadvyāpārasya vā prerakatvam ucyate tat prāg eva pratikṣiptam /	Some hold that a word, indicative of optative mood the sense conveyed by it, constitutes the motive.
svamahimnā prerakatvam asya pūrvam eva nirastam /	This hypothesis has been already refuted.Nyayamanjari An injunction by its intrinsic character does not stir our move- ment.
sādhyasādhanabhāvasaṃbandhāvabodhanapuraśare tu tasya prerakatve phalasyaiva pravartakatvam idam anakṣaram abhihitaṃ bhavati //	If one admits that an injunction prompts us to activity when the causal relation between a sacrifice and heaven has been established then the end turns out to be an instigator in " spite of the absence of his verbal admission.
yas tv āha prerakatvaṃ cet phalaṃ darśayato vidheḥ /	Some hold that an injunction is the real instigator since it reveals the end.
pratyakṣādisamānatvāt svātantryaṃ tasya hīyate //	and the unique character of an injunction is done away with.
sa vācyaḥ phalaśūnyatve sutarām asvātantratā /	He should be informed that if an injunction conveys a fruit- less act then it loses all prestige.
yadriktam arthaṃ mūḍho 'pi na kaścid anutiṣṭhati //	Even an ignorant person does. not undertake a fruitless act.
ko hi nāma niṣphalam arthaṃ prekṣāvān anutiṣṭet / nanu phale 'pi darśite kecit tatra pravartanta eva / kiṃ cātaḥ /	762 Does any intelligent man set to a fruitless work? Now, the Mimāṁsakas contend that there are some persons who do not undertake an act even though they are informed of its result.
kāmaṃ mā pravartiṣata / na hi kārako vidhiḥ api tu jñāpaka ity uktam //	The reason is this that an injunction does not cause one to do an act. But we have stated before that an injunction does not inform.
nanu phalam apradarśayann api jñāpayet /	The Mimamsakas further contend that it may inform of an act though it does not reveal its result.
na jñāpayitum utsahate prekṣāvān hi jñāpyate na ca phalaṃ vinā 'sau tathā jñāpito bhavati ity alaṃ bahubhāṣikayā phalasyaiveṣyamāṇasya paśyan prerakatām ataḥ /	Is there any obstacle to such information? The Naiyãyikas review this contention and point out that such an injunction does not serve the purpose of an indicator to all. If it goes to inform an intelligent person then he is not well-informed in the absence of the declaration of a result. There is no need of talking much about it.
yam artham abhikṛtyeti sūtraṃ vyadhita sūtrakṛt //	So, the result of an action-the object of desire, is the real motive, the author of Nyaya-sutra has thus composed his sutra.
tasmāt puṃsaḥ pravṛttau prabhavati na vidhiḥ nāpi śabdo liṅgādiḥ vyāpāro 'py etadīyo na hi paṭur abhidhā bhāvanānāmadheyā /	The concluding portion of this topic Hence, neither an injunction nor lin-the verbal termination indicative of the optative mood, is the cause of the volition of a person. Even bhāvanā, the denotation of lin-the verbal termination indicative of the optative mood is not cap- able of producing volition.
na śreyaśādhanatvaṃ vidhiviṣayagataṃ nāpi rāgādir evaṃ tenākhyat kāmyamānaṃ phalam amalamatiḥ prerakaṃ sūtrakāraḥ //	It is not also logical to hold that fondness is the cause of volition. So, the author of Nyâyasūtra, who has763 Meaning of a sentence Determined clear thinking, has stated that an end which is the object of desire is the cause of volition.
āha parapakṣān pratikṣipya prerakaṃ kathitaṃ phalam / evaṃ paramatadviṣṭaiḥ vākyārthaḥ svayam ucyatām /	The opponents of the Nyaya school say, "Refuting the rival hypothesis you have established that an end is the final cause of volition. Now, as you are intolerant of other's views so you yourself say what is the meaning of a sentence.
ucyate [yam artham adhikṛtya puruṣaḥ pravartate tat prayojanam] iti vadatā sūtrakṛtā phalaṃ pravartakam iti pradarśitam /	Gautama holds that a motive is that for which a person moves. Thus he has shown that an end has prompting force. An intelligent person knows an object by the source of valid knowledge.
[pramāṇena khalv ayaṃ jñātā 'rtham upalabhya tam īpsati jihāsati vā /	When a person is inclined either to take it or to reject it he makes an effort in that direction.

As Vātsyāyana makes the above remark so he has hinted at the hypothesis that the desire for fruit stirs our movement. So, following his foot-steps we have also subscribed to the above hypothe.is.
vākyārthas tu na kvacid api sūtrakārabhāṣyakārābhyāṃ sūcita iti saḥ śikṣitvā vākyārthasvarūpaṃ vayam ācakṣmahe / kim iti tābhyām asau na sūcitaḥ iti cet pṛtahkprasthānā hīmā vidyāḥ /	But neither the author of Nyaya-sūtra nor his commentator has hinted at the meaning of a sentence in any place. The pur- port of this statement is 'Why do the Naiyāyikas seriously discuss the problem at all? An answer to the question is this that this branch of study has a distinct subject-matter of its own.
pramāṇavidyā ceyam ānvīkṣakī na vākyārthavidyeti //	The Nyaya branch of study is the science of logic but not the science of grammar.
yady evaṃ padārho 'pi kasmād iha darśitaḥ [vyaktyākṛtijātayas tu padārthaḥ] iti sthāne praśnaḥ /	If this is the case then why has the Sūtrakāra discussed the meanings of words, viz., a particular, a universal and the form of a particular? This question is highly reasonable.
sa tu śabdānām arthāsaṃsparśitāṃ vadantaṃ rudantaṃ ca śamayituṃ śabdaprāmāṇyasiddhaye sūtrakṛtā yatnaḥ kṛtaḥ //	The author of the Nyāya sūtra has taken steps to vindicate the validity of ver- bal knowledge. In order to do so he has had to silence his op- ponent who has loudly declared that words have only imaginary meanings.
yady evaṃ vākyārtham api bāhyaṃ vāstavam antareṇa śāstrasya pramāṇatā na pratiṣṭhāṃ labhata iti tatrāpi prayatmaḥ kartavya eva satyam /	If this is so then the truth of verbal knowledge will not be established unless and until it is held that a sentence denotes external reals. Therefore, an effort should be made in this dir-764 ection.
padārthapratipādanayatnenaiva tu kṛtena tatra yatnaṃ kṛtaṃ manyate sūtrakāraḥ yad ayaṃ pṛthak padārthebhyo na vākyārtham upadiśati sma /	The author of the Nyaya- sūtra thinks that steps which he has taken to establish the real meanings of a word have been in the right direction to pro- pound the meaning of a sentence. For this reason he has not given us instruction that the meaning of a sentence is distinct from that of a word.
tasmād ayam asyāśayaḥ padārtha eva vākyārthaḥ iti //	Hence, it is his intention that the mean- ings of words constitute the meaning of a sentence.
tat kim amum eva pakṣaṃ anumodāmahe padārtha eva vākyārtha iti /	For, will the Mimāṁsakas accept the hypothesis that the meanings of words constitute the meaning of a sentence? The Naiyāyikas say in reply 'Oh yes, by all means'.
kiṃ tu naikaḥ padārtho vākyārthaḥ anekas tu padārtho vākyārthaḥ //	Now, some remarks may be made by way of criticism. It has been suggested that many meanings of words constitute the meaning of a sentence.
nanu aneko 'pi bhavan padārtha evāsau /	But they are nothing but meanings of words.
na ca padārtho vākyārtho bhavitum arhati / sāmānye hi padaṃ vartate viśeṣe vākyam /	The meaning of a word can never constitute that of a sentence since a word communicates its meaning in its universal aspect but never does it in the particularized aspect.
anyac ca sāmānyam anyo viśeṣaḥ /	A particular is one thing and a universal is another thing.
anyatrāpy uktam [yad atrādhikyaṃ sa vākyārthaḥ] iti /	It has also been stated in another place that a sentence conveys an additional meaning.
tasmād anyaḥ padārthaḥ anyaś ca vākyārthaḥ /	Therefore, the meaning of a sentence is distinct from that of a word and the meaning of a word is another than that of a sentence.
ucyate yad etad uktam asmābhiḥ [anekaḥ padārtho vākyārthaḥ na punar ekaḥ] iti tan na gṛhītam āyuṣmatā //	O long-lived one: You have not followed the real purport of our statement that many meanings of words constitute the meaning of a sen- tence but not the single meaning of a word constitutes it.
etad uktaṃ bhavati parasparasaṃspṛṣṭapadārthasamudāyo vākyārtha iti saṃsarga evādhika iti [yad atrādhikyaṃ] iti ucyate /	What we have meant to say is this that the mutual relation of word-meaning constitutes the additional meaning of a sentence. As this relation takes place so an extra meaning has been as- serted.
na cānākṣiptaviśeṣatvena saṃsarga upapadyate iti viśeṣo vākyārtha ity ucyate /	If a word does not denote a particular object then the mutual relation of word-meanings is not explained, it is stated that a sentence points to particular objects.
saṃsargas tu svarūpato na vākyārthaḥ apadārthatvāt /	But the relation in itself (i.c., isolated from the relata) does not constitute the meaning of a sentence since it has not been communicated by a word.
[gauḥ śukla ānīyatām] iti padagrāme saṃsargavādinaḥ padasyāśravaṇāt /	Let us take an example, 'Let a white cow be brought'.
śravaṇe 'pi sutarām ananvayāt /	Among the constituent words of a sentence no word which denotes aMeaning of a sentence Determined 765 relation is heard.
[gauḥ śukla ānīyatāṃ saṃsargaḥ] iti ko 'syārthaḥ / tasmāt saṃsṛṣṭo vākyārthaḥ na saṃsargaḥ /	Does the sentence 'Gauḥ śuklā ānīyatām samsargaḥ' (Let a white cow be brought-relation) convey a meaning? Hence, the mutually related meanings of words con- stitute the meaning of a sentence but not their relation in its isolated form.
tad uktaṃ [vyatiṣaktato 'vagater vyatiṣaṅgasya] iti /	This idea has been expressed in the sentence 'Vyatisaktato avagater vyatisaṁgasya' (The meaning of a sen- tence is communicated by the mutually related meanings of its constituent words).
na ca tantubhir iva paṭaḥ vīraṇair iva kaṭaḥ tadatirikto ' vayavisthānīyaḥ padārtho nirvartyamāno vākyārtha upalabhyate /	As threads produce a distinct whole, viz., a cloth or as sticks produce mattress, a distinct whole, so a distinct whole in the shape of the meaning of a sentence is not produced by the meanings of its constituent words.
na ca padārthāvayavī vākyārthaḥ / tena pṛthag vākyārthaṃ nopadiṣṭavān ācāryaḥ //	Hence, a distinct whole, constituted by the meanings of words, is not the meaning of a sentence. So, the author of Nyaya-sūtra has not given the idea of the meaning of a sentence as something distinct.
nanu guṇapradhānabhāvam antareṇa na saṃsargo 'vakalpate /	A relation among meanings is not possible if they are not arranged as principal and secondary ones.
na caikasmin vākye bahūni pradhānāni bhavanti prādhānyam eva hi tathā sati na syāt / guṇās tu bahavo bhavanti /	If many meanings occupy principal posi- tions in a sentence then none actually enjoys the principal posi- tion. In a sentence many meanings may occupy a secondary position.
yad idam anekaguṇoparaktaṃ ekaṃ kiṃcit pradhānaṃ sa vākyārtha iti tadviṣayeyam ekasvabhāvā buddhiḥ /	A judgment which is produced by a sentence refers to the qualified object. The drift of the above statement is that a sentence has a distinct meaning of its own.
satyam / tathāpi ta eva saṃsṛṣṭāḥ padārthā avabhāsante na tadārabdhaḥ kaścid ekaḥ /	The Naiyāyikas point out that the above statement is true but still mutually related meanings are only presented to our consciousness. They also hold that no distinct object is constituted by these mutually related meanings.
sa ca guṇapradhānabhāvo na niyataḥ yena ekam evedaṃ pradhānam iti vyavasthāpyeta /	But the same position is not uniformly occupied by the certain type of meanings in all cases.
kvacit kārakaṃ pradhānam kriyā guṇaḥ dravyasya cikīrṣitatvenāvagamāt [vrīhīn prokṣati] iti //	In some cases, the case form of a noun occupies the principal position and an action becomes subordinate to it. Materials denoted by a noun, are known to be the object of desired action.
siddhatantraṃ kvacit sādhyaṃ tat tantram itarat kvacit /	ļ In some cases, an action occupies a secondary position but a material occupies the principal position.
śabdaprayogatātparyaparyālocanayā bhavet // tasmāt guṇapradhānabhāvāniyamāt anyonyasaṃsṛṣṭaḥ padārthasamudāyo vākyārtha iti etāvad eva śreyaḥ /	Reflecting on the purport of a word the position of the meaning of a word is determined. " In fine, as the position of the meaning of a word in a sentence cannot be settled in a definite manner so it is better to hold that meanings of words which are mutually related constitute the meaning of a sentence.
saṃsargāvagame ca sarvavādinām avivādaḥ //	There is no divergence of opinion about the hypothesis that some relation is communicated by a sentence.
vākyārthaṃ manvate ye 'pi niyogaṃ bhāvanāṃ kriyām / tair apy anyonyasaṃsṛṣṭaḥ padārthagrāma iṣyate //	Those who hold that a mandate or a bhāvanā or an action constitutes the meaning of a sentence admit that the mutually related meanings of words constitute the meaning of a sentence.
nanu saṃsargavad anyavyavacchedo 'pi gamyate /	Now, another point invites our attention.
satyam / saṃsargapūrvakas tu vyavacchedaḥ /	As relation is convey- ed by a sentence so mutual exclusion is also communicated by it.
śuklaguṇasaṃsṛṣṭo hi gauḥ kṛṣṇādibhyo vyavacchidyate /	When the sentence 'Let a white cow be brought' is heard, black, cows etc., are excluded from the meaning of a white cow'.
anyāpohas tu na padārtha ity uktam /	It has been said that mutual exclusion is not the meaning of a word.
tasmān na bhedo vākyārthaḥ //	Hence, mutual exclusion is not conveyed by a sentence as its meaning.
nanu saṃsargo 'pi na śabdārthaḥ /	Now, if the Naiyâyikas argue in this way then relation is also denoted by no word in a sentence.
satyam /	There is much truth in this criticism.
sa hi śabdasyādhidheyo na bhavati na tu tato na pratīyate /	Though the said relation is not denoted by any word yet it is not true that it is not implied by it.
abhidheyaḥ kathaṃ pratīyate iti cet etad agre nirṇīṣyate /	How is it that what is not meant by a word is implied by it? This point will be clarified in the subsequent chapter.
vyavacchede tu na sā gatiḥ /	But mutual exclu- sion cannot be thus implied.
tasmāt saṃsṛṣṭāḥ padārthāḥ vākyārtha iti sthitam // atha vā guṇībhūtetarapadārthānugṛhītaḥ eka eva pradhānabhūtaḥ padārtho vākyārtha ity ekākārapratītibalād upeyatām /	Thus a difinite conclusion is arriv- ed at that the mutually related meanings of words constitute the meaning of a sentence.An End as the meaning of a sentence 767 Or, the meaning of a single word, which occupies the princi- pal position and which is qualified by the meanings of the other words of a sentence, occupying the secondary position, constitutes the meaning of a sentence.
ekas tv ayam asāv artha iti na nirṇetuṃ śakyate /	The establishment of the hypothesis that an end is the meaning of a sentence It is not very easy to determine what is the single meaning of a sentence.
yadi tv avaśyam ekasya kasyacid adhiṣekakalaśo dātavyaḥ tat phalasyaiva dīyatām / na hi niṣprayojanaṃ kiṃcid vākyam uccaryate //	If the pitcher containing coronation water is to be given to any one of these meanings then it may be given to an end since no word is uttered without any purpose. In some cases an end is directly stated by a word.
kvacit sākṣātpadopāttaṃ kvacit prakaraṇāgatam /	In some other cases an end is indicated by the context. In some other cases an end is suggested by discussion.
kvacid ālocanālabhyaṃ phalaṃ sarvatra gamyate // sakalena ca kārakakalāpena kriyā nirvartyate /	The net result is that an end is the ultimate goal which is pointed to in every case. All case forms of nouns produce an action.
kriyayā ca phalam /	An action pro- duces a result, i.
na tu phalenānyat kim api nirvartyata iti pradhānatvāt phalam eva vākyārthaḥ //	But a result produces no other result. Hence, a result is only conveyed by a sentence since it occupies the principal position.
nanu phalam api puruṣārtham iti puruṣaḥ pradhānaṃ syāt /	A question still arises in our mind. An end is for the benefit of a person.
naitad evam /	But an end is not an end in itself.
phalaṃ sukhātmakatvāt puruṣāśritaṃ bhavati sukhādīnām ātmaguṇatvāt /	An end itself is happiness, so it cannot rest unsupported. It finds its support in a person since happiness is an attribute of the soul.
na caitāvatā puruṣaḥ pradhānam /	A mandate cannot induce a person to undertake an action if there is no end to realise.
so 'pi hi phalārtham eva yatate / bhāvanā tāvat phalaniṣṭha eva vyāpāraḥ niyogasyāpi phalaṃ vinā na pravartakatvam ity uktam / kriyāyā api kevalāyā vākyārthatvam apāstam //	The hypothesis that an action in itself which involves no reference to an end is the meaning of a sentence has been refuted. Hence, as an end is an object to be realised without an exception and as all actions, etc., are directed towards it, so it is desirable that an end is the meaning of a sentence.Nyayamanjari The Mimāṁsakas raise an objection to the above conclusion. The goal of an action is heaven, etc.
tasmāt phalasya sādhyatvāt sarvatra tadavarjanāt /	Hence, they cannot end into relation with case forms of nouns.
kriyādīnāṃ ca tādarthyāt tasya vākyārthateṣyate // nanu phalasya svargādeḥ nisargataḥ siddharūpatvāt kārakais saha saṃbandho na prāpnoti /	Case forms of nouns cannot be related to pre-existing things by such relation as holds between any cause and an effect. Now, the Naiyāyikas may contend that they may be related through the intervening action.
siddhasya ca kaḥ saṃbandhaḥ / kriyāgarbha iti cet tarhi phalam api kārakāṇy api kriyayā saṃbadhyate ko viśeṣaḥ /	The end is related to an action. The case forms of nouns are also related to an action. What is the difference between case forms of noun and an end? The case forms of nouns are relat- ed to an action which is a means.
paraṃ tu kārakāṇi sādhanatvena phalaṃ tu sādhyatvena /	But an end is related to an action as an object to be realised.
kriyayā hi phalaṃ sādhyate na phalena kriyety ataḥ phalasyaiva prādhānyam iti siddham //	An object is accomplish- ed by an action. An action is not produced by an end, i.e., an object. Hence, it is established that an end occupies the prominent place.
anyonyasaṃgativiśeṣita eva yasmāt vākyārthabhāvam upayāti padārthapuṃjaḥ / etac ca cetasi nidhāya tato na bhinnaṃ vākyārtham abhyakadhita ca kaścana sūtrakāraḥ //	As the meanings of words, being mutually related, constitute the meaning of a sentence so the author of Nyâya-sütra, taking note of it, has not said that a sentence conveys a distinct meaning, i.e., a meaning which is other than those of words.
prādhānyayogād atha vā phalasya vākyārthatā tatra satāṃ hi yatnaḥ /	768 Or, owing to the prominence of its position an end is assert- ed to be the meaning of a sentence.
prayojanaṃ sūtrakṛtā tad eva pravartakatvena kilopadiṣṭam //	It is well known to all that an end has been taught by the author of Nyāya-sūtra as the motive.
apare punaḥ liṅādiśabdaśravaṇe sati samupajāyamānām ātmaspandaviśeṣaṃ udyogaṃ nāma vākyārtham ācakṣate /	The refutation of the hypothesis that the vibration of the soul (udyoga) is the meaning of a senteuce: Some thinkers hold that when one listens to the verbal termination in the optative mood a distinct type of activity (udyoga) arises in the soul. This udyoga constitutes the mean- ing of a sentence.

Thus no new hypothesis has been suggested.
atha prayatna ātmaspandaḥ tarhi bhāvanāyā nāmāntarakaraṇam udyoga iti //	Again, if volition is the action of the soul then udyoga is another name for bhavanā.
atha icchādveṣayor anyataro 'sau tarhi sukhecchā duḥkhajihāsā vā vākyārtha iti akṣapādapakṣa evāyaṃ nāpūrvaṃ kiṃcid //	Now, if it is either of the two, desire and hatred, then the meaning of a sentence is either desire for pleasure or desire for the avoidance of pain. This is the hypothesis of the Naiyãyikas.
athāpi bhāṭṭaparikalpito vyāpāra ātmaspandaḥ so 'pi bhāvanaiva nārthāntaram //	Or, if the activity of the soul as suggested by the Bhättas is the vibration of the soul then it is bhāvanã only and nothing else.

This hypothesis has been already refuted since its parallel hypothesis that a sentence conveys the knowledge of relation has been refuted.
pratibhā khalu vijñānaṃ tac ca śabdena jāyate /	Pratibhā is surely a form of knowledge. It is produced by a sentence.
na tu śabdasya viṣayaḥ rūpadhīr iva cakṣuṣaḥ // bāhyasya viṣayasyābhāvāt saiva viṣaya iti cet na tasya samarthitatvāt //	But it is not denoted by a sentence. Just as the awareness of colour is produced by eyes: But colour is not an object of them (Hence Pratibhā is not the meaning of a sen- tence).

The argument does not hold good since the existence of an external object has been proved. When the sentence that a tiger has come is uttered different emotions arise in the minds of courageous and timid persons.
tasya hi jñāyamāno 'rthaḥ karaṇam na tadjñānamātram /	But the mere knowledge of a tiger does not bring about such a change.
arthas tadānīṃ nāstīti cet vipralambhavākyam idaṃ asatyārthaṃ bhaviṣyati na tv abāhyaviṣayaṃ tat /	If the upholder of the above hypothesis contends that the external object does not exist at that time then our reply to the contention is that it is a deceptive one and that it will not accord to the object denoted by it.

The different subjects have different forms of knowledge. Similarly, when different persons have grasped the meaning of the sentence that a tiger has come, different mental reactions take place. The brave per- sons are encouraged to hunt it. The timid ones are cowed down with fear.

Now, the upholders may contend that though knowledge is not denoted by a sentence yet it will constitute the meaning of a sentence like the rela- tion of objects.
saṃsṛṣṭā vākyārthaḥ na saṃsargaḥ /	The mutually related objects constitute the meaning of a sen- tence but not the mere relation of objects.

The argument is not tenable since though sen- tences indicate past or future objects yet they point to such objects as have been proved to be real. It is superfluous to hammer this point into their head.771 Real Nature of a Word In fine, the meaning of a sentence is objectively real.
vākyārthaḥ paramārtha eva tad ayaṃ no kalpanānirmitaḥ tadvān apy uditaḥ padasya viṣayas tenārthasaṃsparśinā /	Even if it is held that a few words have imaginary meanings then it is to be admitted that these words are related to objects.

ÄHNIKA VI An introductory discussion to ascertain the real nature of a word The objector raises a question that the problem of the vali- dity of verbal knowledge has not been as yet solved since the source of the knowledge of the meaning of a word and that of a sentence has not been determined.
ucyate kim atra nirūpaṇīyam /	The Naiyāyikas say in reply that they solve it thus:- Is there any difficulty to solve the problem ? If an event follows in quick succession an antecedent one then the latter is the cause of the former.
yadanantaraṃ hi yad bhavati tat tasya nimittam / padavākyaśravaṇe sati padārthavākyārthasaṃpratyayo bhavatīti te eva tatra nimittam //	When one listens to a word or a sentence he is aware of the meaning of a word or of that of a sentence. Hence a word and a sentence condition the knowledge of the meaning of a word and that a sentence respectively.
kiṃ ca vākyam iti / uktam atra varṇasamūhaḥ padam padasamūho vākyam iti //	What is a word? And what is a sentence? As assemblage of letters is called a word. A collocation of words is called a sentence.
na hi varṇānāṃ samūhaḥ kaścid asti vāstavaḥ /	The above definitions are not satisfactory since the real -assemblage of letters is a fiction.
tena kutas tatsamūhaḥ padaṃ bhaviṣyati / tadabhāvāc ca na tarāṃ padasamūho vākyam avakalpate /	If it is so then how will letters assemble to constitute a word? If the formation of a word is impossible then a sentence which is said to be the collocation of words is far more impossible.
na ca varṇānāṃ vyastasamastavikalpopahatatvena vācakatvam upapadyate /	Again, letters cannot denote a meaning since the problem, Do letters singly or collectively convey a meaning ?' has not been squarely solved.
tasmād anya eva sphoṭātmā śabdo 'rthapratipādaka iti pratijānate /	Hence the objectors hold that there is another word which is distinct from letters. It is called sphota.
sphoṭo 'nya evārthapratipādako bhavatu /	This name is significant because it communicates its meaning.
kā kṣatinaiyāyikānām kathaṃ na kṣatiḥ āptapraṇītatvena hi śabdasya prāmāṇyaṃ tair uktam /	What is the harm to us ?' The objectors point out "Why is it not a source of trouble to them ? The Naiyāyikas hold that a word or a sentence is a source of true knowledge because its author is a772 trust-worthy person.
sphoṭasya ca nityatvena nāptapraṇītatvam /	But a sphota, being eternal, does not owe its existence to a trust-worthy person.
ataś ca yasyānityatvaṃ varṇātmanaḥ śabdasya sādhitam nāsāv arthapratītihetuḥ, ato na pramāṇam /	But such a collocation of letters is not a source of valid knowledge since it fails to convey a meaning. But the word viz. sphoța which communicates a meaning is not non-eternal. Hence, it has not been effectuated by a trustworthy person.
yaś cārthapratītihetuḥ sphoṭātmā śabdaḥ tasya nānityatvam, na cāptapraṇītatvam iti asthāne naiyāyikāḥ kliṣṭā bhaveyuḥ / tasmād anityānāṃ varṇānām eva vācakatvaṃ pratiṣṭhāpanīyam /	For this very reason the Naiyāyikas have got to prove by all means that non-eternal letters convey a meaning and that hypothesis of a sphota is to be refuted. Now, the argument of the Naiyāyikas is as follows: Let us take an example viz. the word 'gauḥ'. When the letters 'g' etc.
parākaraṇīyaś ca sphoṭa iti //	are presented to our consciousness we are aware of a mean- ing.
tad ucyate gakārādivarṇāvagame saty arthapratīter abhāvāt tadabhāve cābhāvāt teṣām evārthapratyāyanasāmarthyam /	But if they are not presented to our consciousness, we have no knowledge of its meaning. Hence the letters 'g' etc. are competent to communicate a meaning.
ta eva ca śravaṇakaraṇakāvagamagocaratayā śabdavyapadeśabhāja iti pratītyanupārūḍhaḥ sphoṭo nāma śabdaḥ kaścit pratyakṣānumānātītaḥ parikalpanīyaḥ /	Again, they are called sound since they are grasped by our auditory sense- organ. Hence, we should not assume a word designated as sphota since it is neither perceived nor inferred nor presented to our consciousness. The Refutation of the Hypothesis that Letters Convey a sense The objector, i.
āha katham evaṃ bhaviṣyati / dūrāpetā ime manorathāḥ /	e., the upholder of the hypothesis of sphoța reviews the above criticism and says "How will your hypothesis stand? All your hopes are shattered.
kuto varṇānām arthapratyāyakatvam te hi varṇā gakārādayaḥ arthaṃ pratipādayantaḥ samastāḥ pratipādayeyuḥ vyastā vā / na tāvad vyastāḥ ekaikavarṇākarṇane saty apy arthapratīter anutpādāt /	How do the letters con- vey a sense? If the letters viz.'g' etc are to communicate a meaning then do they convey it singly or collectively? A letter cannot singly convey a sense since when a letter is singly heard no sense is made out.
sāmastyaṃ varṇānāṃ nāsty eva /	The collocation of letters is an impossi- bility.
naiyāyikapakṣe tāvat sattayā yaugapadyam avidyamānam āśuvināśinaḥ śabdasya darśitatvāt // athāpi mīmāṃsakamatena nityaḥ śabda iṣyate tatrāpi sattayā yaugapadyasya sakalavarṇasādhāraṇatvāt kena varṇasamudāyena ko 'rthaḥ pratyāyyeteti nāvadhāryate // athocyate na cakśurādīnām iva varṇānāṃ kārakatvam yenāgṛhītānām eva satāṃ yaugapadyamātram arthapratyāyanāṅgaṃ syāt /	Even if it is assumed that a collocation of letters takes place then does it convey a sense, itself remaining unknown or being known" ? According to the Naiyāyikas letters do not coexist when they are not cognised since it has been proved that sounds pass away like a dream. Though the Mimāṁsakas hold that a sound is eternal yet all letters from 'a' to 'z' coexist. Hence it is very difficult to deter- mine that a definite collocation of letters expresses a precise meaning.· Hypothesis that letters convey a sense Refuted 773 Now, the Naiyãyikas may contend that letters do not effe- ctuate consciousness like the eyes etc.
jñāpakatvāt teṣāṃ gṛhītānāṃ satāṃ dhūmādivat pratyāyakatvam iti pratītāv eva sāmastyam upayujyate iti //	But as letters serve as a mark so they indicate another object when they themselves are present and known like smoke etc. Hence when they are presented to our conscious- ness their assemblage is a necessary condition.
etad apy aghaṭamānam /	But such a collection of letters is an impossible feat.
pratītisāmastyaṃ hi kim ekavaktṛprayuktānāṃ varṇānām uta nānāpuruṣabhāṣitānām / tatra ekadā anekapuruṣabhāṣitānāṃ kolāhalasvabhāvatvena svarūpabheda eva duravagama iti kasya sāmastyam asāmastyaṃ vā cintyeta /	Are the letters which constitute an assemblage uttered by a single speaker or by many speakers ? Now, if it is held that the said assemblage is of such letters as are uttered by many speakers then a great uproar takes place. Letters being drowned in that uproar, their individual distinction is hard to discern. Under these circumstances you will think of assemblage or non-assemblage of such letters.
saty api vā tathāvidhe sāmastye nāsty evārthapratītiḥ //	Even though we admit that letters anyhow assem- ble yet such an assemblage does not convey a sense.
ekavaktṛprayuktānāṃ tu prayatnasthānakaraṇakramāparityāgāt avaśyaṃbhāvī kramaḥ /	Now, if letters are pronounced by a single speaker then it is noted that they are uttered with the help of different organs of speech. They are pronounced successively but not simultaneously.
krame ca saty ekaikavarṇakaraṇikārthapratītiḥ prāpnoti /	If such succession is admitted then a single letter should convey a sense.
na cāsau dṛśyata iti vyastasamastavikalpānupapatteḥ na varṇā vācakāḥ //	Therefore, as the assumption of the assemblage or the non-assem- blage of letters has no logical significance, letters do not convey a sense.
varṇaviṣayā api buddhis tathaiva vikalpanīyāḥ /	The same criticism holds good with regard to the pheno- mena of consciousness, produced by letters.
tā api na yugapat saṃbhavanti /	The events of cons- ciousness, produced by consecutive letters cannot simultaneously take place.
krame ca sati ekaikavarṇabuddher arthasaṃpratyayaḥ prasajyeteti //	If each letter successively produces an event of consciousness the awareness of each letter should convey a sense.
yad api ucyate pūrvavarṇajanitasaṃskārasahitaḥ antyavarṇaḥ pratyāyaka iti tad apy ayuktam /	Again, the upholders of this view may further contend that the last letter of a word with the aid of impressions due to the awareness of its antecedent letters conveys a sense.
saṃskāro hi nāma yad anubhavajanitaḥ, tadviśayam eva smaraṇam upajanayati na punar arthāntaraviṣayaṃ jñānam iti /	An impression revives the recollection only of that object the consciousness of which has produced it (the im- pression). But it cannot produce the consciousness of another object.
smṛtidvāreṇāsau tarhy arthapratyāyako 'sau bhaviṣyatīti cet etad api nāsti jñānayaugapadyaprasaṅgāt / antyavarṇajñānānantaraṃ hi pūrvavarṇasmaraṇam iva samayasmaraṇam api tadaivāpatati /	If one admits it then he should also admit that different forms of consciousness simultaneously take place since like the memory of all letters antecedent to the last one the knowledge of denotation should also be assembled at this time, following the experience of the last letter. Otherwise, there is no room for the knowledge of denotation.
tataś ca jñānayaugapadyam //	And for this rea- son the simultaneity of consciousness happens to take place.
na ca kramotpade kiṃcit kāraṇam utpaśyāmaḥ /	It does not render its as- sistance to sense-organs by its operation to produce a judgment which refers to letters.
athāpi tena kramena bhavetām tathāpi tadānīm antyavarṇajñānam uparatam iti kasya sāhāyyakaṃ pūrvavarṇasmṛtiṃ vidadhātīti //	Then, why do not they convey a sense, having a mutual change of place? If the order of letters is distinct from letters themselves then something dis- tinct is admitted to denote a meaning.
etac cānekapūrvavarṇaviṣayām ekāṃ smṛtimam[smṛtim?] abhyupagamyoktam /	In that case, the critics express their wish to come over to this side (the side of de- fenders).
na punar ekā sarvavarṇagocarā smṛtiḥ /	A word is used by a person and it communicates a meaning.
kutaḥ bhinnopalaṃbhasaṃbhūtavāsanābhedanimittāḥ / bhaveyuḥ smṛtayo bhinnāḥ na tv ekā 'nekagocaraḥ //	The upholders of the hypothesis of sphota say in reply that they should now discuss the point as to how one learns the meaning of a word from the verbal usage of another person.
atha bhavet saṃkalanājñānam ekaṃ sadasadvarṇagocaraṃ bhaviṣyati /	If one learns that another person understands the meaning of the word in question then he understands that the word conveys the same sense.
tadrūpārūḍhāś ca varṇāḥ arthaṃ pratyāyayiṣyantīti tad api durāśāmātram /	But it is also a fact that when letters are uttered they communicate a mean- ing.
tathāvidhajñānotpattau kāraṇābhāvāt /	This knowledge of the meaning is an event in time.
na saṃskāro vartamānagrāhī bhavati /	This event cannot take place if there is no cause par excellence to account for it.

ataś caivam yadi te vācakā bhaveyuḥ viparītakramaprayuktā apy arthaṃ gamayeyuḥ / kramaś ced apekṣyate sa vyatiriktāvyatiriktatayā cintanīyaḥ /	Let its cause be in- ferred. Or, let it be an instance of negative inference. Or, let it be a case of presumption. By all means one is to accept the knowledge of meaning as an effect.
tad uktam [yāvanto yādṛśā ye ca yadarthapratipādane /	On the strength of anyone of the above arguments a cause par excellence of the said effect is to be assumed.
tad ucyate vyutpattir eveyaṃ vicāraṇīyā vartate /	We suggest that the cause par excel- lence in question is sphoța.

Hence, defects which have been mentioned to undermine the hypothesis that letters convey a meaning do not affect the hypothesis that sphoța conveys a sense.
tasmāt sarvaprakāram avācakā varṇāḥ /	Hence, sphoţa denotes a meaning.
asti ceyaṃ śabdād uccaritāt tadarthāvagatiḥ /	It has been said that a meaning is communi- cated by a word (śabda).
na ceyam akaraṇikaiva bhavitum arhati /	Such a usage is highly appropriate.
sarvathā 'rthapratītilakṣaṇakāryavaśāt kalpyamānaṃ tat karaṇaṃ sphoṭa ity ucyate /	In other words, 'sabda' is the basic stem. It stands for sphoţa.
ataś ca sphoṭo 'rthapratipādakaḥ śabdād arthaṃ pratipadyāmaha iti vyavahārāt /	Now, the upholders of the above hypothesis may contend that the word 'sabda' denotes letters and these letters convey a sense.
bhavato hi varṇajanitas saṃskāro 'rthapratipādakaḥ / tatra [śabdād] iti prātipadikārtho 'nupapannaḥ // atha varṇāḥ śabdaśabdenocyante /	If the above contention is true then the usage should be that words communicate a meaning but not a word does it. If a word is taken as synonymous with a sphota then it becomes appropriate to hold that a word conveys a meaning.
te cārthapratipādakāḥ iti idam anyathāsiddham tathāpi [śabdāt] ity ekatvaṃ vibhaktyartho na saṃgacchate /	Thus the case-ending in singular number and the basic stem are appro- priately used. Now, the upholders of the rival hypothesis take an exception to the said conclusion and argue that the word 'fabda' does not denote sphota.
śabdebhyaḥ pratipadyāmaha iti vyavahāraḥ syāt /	But it stands for letters since word 'sabda' denotes audible sense-data.
nanu na sphoṭaḥ śabdaśabdenocyate kin tu varṇā eva /	The import of this argument is that sphota is not denoted by the word 'sabda'.
ta eva ca śrotragrahaṇā iti naitad evam śabdatvasyāpi śrotragrahaṇātmano bhāvāt / nirjhara jhāṅkāraravaprabhṛtīnāṃ ca saty api śrotragrahaṇatve śabdakāryanirvartakatvānupapateḥ /	The argument does not hold good since the universal which be-Sphota as an Inference longs to all sabdas is also audible but lacks the practical efficí- ency of a sabda. Moreover, though the inarticulate murmur of the spring is audible yet it cannot communicate a meaning like a śabda.
tasmāt yato 'rthapratipattiḥ sa śabdaḥ /	Hence, what communicates a meaning is a sabda.
arthapratipattiś ca sphoṭād eva na varṇebhya iti sphoṭa eva śabdaḥ //	A sphota-sabda communicates a meaning. But letters do not con- vey a sense.
nanu evaṃ sati dhūmādīnām apy arthapratītihetutvāt śabdatvaṃ prāpnoti maivaṃ vādīḥ /	For this reason, sphota alone deserves to be denoted by the word śabda, 777 Now, the upholders of the rival hypothesis raise another objec- tion that if what points to another object is śabda then smoke, a substance, which indicates another object should be taken as sabda.
[atha gaur] ity atra śrotrajapratibhāse bahavo 'rthāḥ pratibhāsante tatra kas teṣāṃ śabdaḥ ity upakramya yato 'rthapratipattiḥ sa śabda ity upasaṃhṛte kuto dhūmādīnāṃ śabdatvaśaṅkāvakāśaḥ //	When we hear at the commencement of a state- ment 'Atra Gauh' many objects are presented to our auditory sense-perception. Let us discern at the out-set what is a sabda among them. We come to a decision that what communicates a meaning is a sabda. If this conclusion is established then there is no room for the doubt that smoke and such other substances are ŝabdas.

The defenders of the sphota hyphothesis give a reply to the above cri- ticism.
ananyathāsiddhaṃ tadbhāvabhāvitvaṃ tatkāryatām avagamayati nānyathāsiddham /	What is not an invariable, unconditional and immediate antecedent is not a cause.

Letters do not invariably, unconditionally and immediately precede the communication of meaning.
nanu sphoṭavyaktāv aprīdānīṃ varṇānāṃ kva gatās te vyastasamastavikalpāḥ /	How is it that they do not precede in such a manner? Letters manifest a sphota at the out-set.

kutaḥ eke tāvad ācakṣate prathamavarṇaśravaṇavelāyām eva sphoṭo 'bhivyakto bhavati /	If the critics ask 'why' then the reply is as follows. A band of thinkers defends the hypothesis in this way. When the first letter is heard a sphota is manifested.
na ca dvitīyādivarṇavaiphalyam tadavagater evātiśayakaraṇāt /	The second letter and the rest ones are not to be taken as superfluous since they make an improvement upon the manifestation of a sphoța.

Though the true character of the gem is not clearly manifested at that time yet it clearly reveals itself to his mind when it is repeatedly examined. Similarly, in this case too when the first letter of a word is heard a sphota is manifested. Though its manifestation takes place yet the speaker will employ the other letters in order to make the said manifestation much more vivid and distinct.
apare tu vadanti dhvanaya eva sphoṭasya ca vyaṃjakāḥ /	When a sphota is manifested it comes in contact with the organs of speech viz. palate etc.

It eclipses the real character of a sphoța and makes it appear as one having many parts such as letters etc. As the air is constantly flowing so dhvanis pass away after they have been pronounced.

tasmān na pāramārthikā eva te varṇāḥ, na ca sphoṭasya vyaṃjakā iti kva samastavyastavikalpāḥ prabhaveyuḥ //	Therefore, how can the above riddles, viz., 'Does a letter singly manifest a sphoța ? Do letters collectively manifest a sphoța* etc. exert their influence upon the hypothesis in question.

These letters have only imaginary forms. The up- holders of the rival hypothesis say, 'It is observed by the joint method of agreement and difference that letters condition the communication of meaning.' On the basis of this observation.

They mean to say that a sphoța appears as a letter when it is associated with a dhvani. Let us take a parallel case. A face appears to be long etc.
tatra padasphoṭāt padārthapratipattiḥ vākyasphoṭāc ca vākyārthapratipattiḥ //	Therefore, the consciousness of a word refers to a pada- sphota and the consciousness of a sentence refers to a vakya- sphota.
āha yadi niravayavaḥ sphoṭātmā śabdo bhavati vākyam api śabda eva /	If a sphoța-śabda is partless then a sentence is also a sphota but nothing else.

tasya cet padātmāno 'vayavā bhavanti padasyāpi tarhi varṇātmāno 'vayavā bhavantu /	Again, if the sphota-vādins hold that a sentence consists of words as its part then words should also consist of parts in the shape of letters.
ucyate / kiṃcid ucchvasitam iva me hṛdayam /	The sphota-vadins say in reply to the above criticism : Our heart leaps with joy on hearing the above remark.

paramārthatas tu padasphoṭo vākyāvayavabhūto nāsty eva /	But really speaking, a pada-sphota does not constitute the part of a sentence.
niravayavam eva vākyaṃ niravayavasyaiva vākyārthasya bodhakam /	As a word is partless so a sentence is also partless and a word does not constitute its part.
yathā cāhuḥ vākye padānām asattvāt tadarthe padārthānāṃ niravayavau vākyavākyārthāv iti //	If one imagines that a sentence consists of parts then an absurd conclusion will be inevitable. Let us clearly state our argument.

If y you stop the process of vivisection into parts on reaching letters then why should you not stop it at a sentence? The consciousness of the meaning of a sentence is like an integrate whole which admits of no division.

Those who commence verbal communication learn the usage of language together with its import from the uses of the experienced ones. The experienced ones do never employ words unnecessarily since mere words do not play an impor- tant part in a verbal transaction.
vākyaṃ tu prayogārham iti tatraiva vyutpattiḥ /	A sentence renders a useful service in such transaction, if one is initiated into the use of a sentence.
tata evārthasaṃpratyayaḥ /	A sense is definitely grasped from it.

In reply to the above question we say that such a division of a sentence into parts is merely imagina- ry but not real.

Hence, a row of ants sho- uld be held as the cause of the cloud of dust (The sense of this argument is that mere sequence does not help to determine the relation of causality holding between the antecedent and the consequent events.

Hence words which consist of the two elements, viz., the basic element and the suffix are not real.

It is also seen that even an im- aginary object is a means to the realisation of a real object since false snake-bite and the like effectuate actual death.

The sphoța-vādins join issue with them and hold that the above contention is not sound.

Bhartrhari in his Väkyapadiya has said to this effect. Some specialists in Etvmology have drawn out words from partless sentences by their pure imagination and divided them into two. four or five classes.

For this very reason com- plete sentences included in the chapter of a book should not enjoy real existence.

Sabda is the Absolute. It is the One without a second. Various tendencies of thought arise from the beginningless Nescience.

The form of Vāk which is self-luminous consciousness and whose flow in a series of successive events is not noticed is called Paśyanti.

A sentence is not a whole consisting of parts. Hence the distinction which holds good between a whole and its parts does not apply to a sentence. A sentence admits of no parts.

Under these circumsta- nces we do not consider it to be wise to hold that words and letters enjoy real existence. In fine, Vákya-sphoța is indivisible one. It admits of no changes i.e.

What is your basis? Do you admit the existence of sphoța on the strength of an inference? Or, do you do it on the stronger evidence of perception? You cannot establish the existence of a sphoța by means of an inference since the letters which are arranged in a definite visible order convey a meaning, being thus arranged.

naitat durvikalpās te vyastānāṃ tāvad vācakatvaṃ neṣyata eva varṇānām / samastā eva te vācakāḥ //	The said criticism is not sound. The dilemmas, advanced by the critics, are specimens of bad logic. When letters stand apart, without being related to one another they individually convey no meaning.
yat tu tat sāmastyaṃ nāsti kramabhāvitvād iti /	The possibility of the collection of letters has been gain- said because they appear successively. Such a criticism is not sound.
tad asat kramabhāvinām api samastānāṃ kāryakāriṇāṃ anekaśo darśanāt /	There are several instances which show that the succeeding phenomena form a collection and conjointly produce an effect.

ekasminn api hi grāse hīyamāne na bhavati tādṛśī tṛptiḥ /	If one of these morsels is left out then such satisfaction does not arise.
ataḥ samastā eva te grāsāḥ tṛpteḥ kāraṇam /	Hence, this satisfaction is the conjoint effect of all morsels of food.

In other words, the combination of these two sacrifices has been admitted. These two are main sacrifices. Each of them has many subsi- diary sacrifices known as Agneyas (dedicated to Agni) and others.
ataś cāyaṃ virodhaḥ sāmastyaṃ kramabhāvitvaṃ ceti //	Hence, the successiveness of these acts is unavoidable.

The Sphota-vadins say in reply to this question, 'We hold that they bring about minor Apūrvas. We also hold on the strength of the authority of the Vedas that when all the minor sacrifices viz., Agneya etc.

Have you got an experience of such contribution? Do minor Apūrvas individually produce parts of heavenly bliss? They cannot produce such parts since the main act remains unper- formed as yet.
tat sāmastyāt pūrvaṃ na kvacid upalabhyate /	Therefore the collection of minor Apūrvas has got no important part to play.
na hy avāntarāpūrveṇa svargamātrā kācid abhinirvartyate śāstrārthasya tadānīm aniṣpannatvāt /	e. parts of speech, clearly play an important role as parts of a sentence. They communicate the meanings of words. These meanings constitute parts of the meaning of a sentence.

But letters do not contribute towards the gradual communication of the sense of a word. In spite of this contrast letters produce their impressions and memories since they are vividly perceiv- ed.

Hence, there is no exception to contribution on the part of letters to- wards the slow but progressive realisation of the main object. In other words, letters behave in the same way like the examp- les quoted above. But there is a bit difference in the mode of operation of these letters. A word consists of a few letters.

But the last letter bodily exists at the time of rendering an assistance to the communication of the meaning of a word. In the manner just stated the collo- cation of letters conveys the sense of a word just as the imaginary momentary acts bring about the ultimate result.
atha vā kramopalabdheṣv api varṇeṣu mānasam anuvyavasāyarūpam akhilavarṇaviṣayaṃ saṃkalanājñānaṃ yad upajāyate tat arthapratyāyanāṅgaṃ bhaviṣyati /	Though these letters are successively perceived yet a recog- nitive judgment of inner perception like an introspection will arise. It will refer to all the letters. It will help to communi- cate the meaning of a word.
dṛśyate ca vinaśvareṣv api padārthāntareṣu kramānubhūteṣu yugapad anuvyavasāyo mānasaḥ [śatam āmrāṇi bhakṣitavān devadattaḥ] iti /	Suppose, a few objects have perished and have been perceived one after another. Still, our experience says that there arises a recognitive inner perception which refers to all those past objects. Let us cite an example. Devadatta ate a hundred mangoes.
na cāyaṃ pratyayo nāsti sandigdhaḥ bodhyate vā /	It is not also an erroneous judgment which is contradicted by a subsequent judgment.
anabhyupagamyamāne cedṛśī samuccayajñāne tannibandhanā bhūyāṃso vyavahārā utsīdeyuḥ //	If a copulative judg- ment of this sort is not assumed then many verbal usages based upon the similar judgments should be discredited.
sa cāyaṃ saṃkalanāpratyayaḥ smaryamāṇānubhūyamānaprāktanāntyavarṇaviṣayatayā sadasadvarṇagocaraś citrarūpa upeyate /	The judg- ment in question refers to past letters, the objects of recollection and to the last letter which is an object of present perception. Thus it refers to both types of letters existent and non-existent.
yadi vāntyavarṇe tirohite bhavan asadvarṇagocara eva citrākāraḥ so 'rthapratītihetur eka eveti niravakāśā vyastasamastavikalpāḥ //	Or, if the said judgment arises after the passing away of the last letter then it refers only to non-existent letters. And as such it has no peculiar form. This judgment alone conditions the communication of the meaning of a word.

In that case, though all letters are presented to this copulative judg- ment yet the collocation of all letters cannot help the communi- cation of the meaning of a word. But if all letters are synthe- sised by the said judgment like a bunch of flowers then the order of succession of all letters being not referred to by the judgment, these letters should condition the conveying of the sense of a word though they are arranged in a reverse order.
ucyate /	The Naiyâyikas meet this objection thus: A mere copulative judgment does not condition the communication of the sense of a word.
viśiṣṭānupūrvīkavarṇamālā 'nubhavasamanantarabhāvī hi saṃkalanāpratyayo 'rthapratīter hetuḥ na stabakākāraparicchedamātram /	The required judgment which immediately follows the perception of letters arranged in a distinct order of succes- sion causes the communication of the meaning of a word. This judgment is not the presentation of letters merely arranged like a bunch of flowers.
viparītakramāśaṅkanaṃ ca tadānīṃ kutastyam /	If this is the case then how do you entertain a doubt about the arrangement of letters in a reverse order? Again, if the said judgment were the presentation of letters like a bunch of flowers then there would have not arisen the question of the order of arrangement reverse or non-reverse i.e.
stabakāvabhāse tāvat krama eva nāsti /	actual since in a bunch of flowers no order of the arrangement of followers is followed.
kasya vaiparītyam avaiparītyaṃ vā yadanantarajanmā 'yaṃ samuccayapratyayaḥ / tāś ca viśiṣṭakramāvabhāsinya eva pūrvabhāvinyo varṇabuddhaya iti kuto vaiparītyavikalpaḥ /	This copulative judgment which refers to a definite number of letters follows in close succession to the antecedent acts of perception caused by these letters. The acts of perce- ption reveal the serial order of the said letters. Hence, how can the reversal of the serial order of these letters take place ? These letters which are grasped by the first experience follow a definite serial order.
tasmāt prathamaparipaṭhananiyatānupūrvīkās te tadanantarabhāvisamastāvabhāsisaṃkalanāpratyayopārūḍhā varṇā arthapratītikāriṇaḥ syur iti na doṣaḥ //	They being arranged in that very order are referred to by the successive copulative judgment. These letters as presented by the copulative judgment make way for the communication of the meaning of a word, constitu- ed by them. Hence, our hypothesis suffers from no defect.
yahtā vā pūrvārṇajanitasaṃskārasahito 'ntyavarṇa iti tatrabhavatā mīmāṃsābhāṣyakṛtāvarṇitaṃ tathā varṇānām arthapratyāyakatvam astu //	Another alternative suggestion may be possible. Sabara, the authoritative commentator on the Mimārisă Sūtras, has describ-Nyāyamanjari ed that the last letter of a word accompanied by the impre- ssions of its previous letters, convey the sense of a word, constituted by them.
nanu atroktaṃ saṃskārasyārthapratītijanakatvaṃ na dṛṣṭapūrvaṃ smṛtāv eva tasya vyāpāra iti /	We have already said what we should say now with regard to this subject-matter. We have stated that an impression does not produce the knowledge of the meaning of a word.
kim iyaṃ rājājñā / smṛtir eva saṃskāreṇa kartavyeti // neyaṃ rājājñā nayājñā tv eṣā /	Now a question arises in our mind, Viz., 'It is a royal mandate that an impression shall produce memory only?' An answer to this question is this that it is the mandate of logic but not that of a king.
na hi saṃskāro nāma svatantraḥ ko 'pi dharmī /	An impression is not a distinct substratum.
kin tu paṭvabhyāsādarapratyayagṛhīteṣv artheṣu yat ātmanaḥ smaraṇakāraṇaṃ sa saṃskāraḥ /	When we carefully know an object and repeat its knowledge with all seriousness the traces of knowledge are called an impression which can revive memory only.

na ca śaktirūpasya saṃskārasya śaktyantaram arthapratītijanmani saṃbhavati /	It is not possible for an impression which itself is an after effect of knowledge to be able to generate the new knowledge of an object.

An impression which revives memory owes its origin to the apprehension of an object. If one holds that an impression generates the apprehension of an object, he speaks of a novel type of impression. It is very difficult on our part to find out the cause of such an impression.
tasmān nāsāv arthapratītihetur bhavati //	Therefore, an impression can- not be the cause of the apprehension of an object.
naitat sāram varṇānubhavasaṃskṛtamateḥ puṃsaḥ arthapratītidarśanāt /	The above argument is not sound. A person who possesses the impression of a letter arising from apprehension is seen to apprehend an object.
na hi smaraṇaśaktiḥ saṃskāraḥ /	Thus a saṁskāra (impression) is not merely such a faculty as exclusively generates recollection.
kin tv ātmaguṇo vāsanākhyaḥ /	It is an attribute of the soul.
sa ca smṛtim ivārthapratītim api janayitum utsahe /	It is capable of producing the apprehen- sion of an object just as it generates memory.

nāsau niṣkaraṇikā syāt / karaṇavyatirekeṇa hi sānudbhavantī karaṇam ākṣipati /	We cannot say that such an event occurs without any cause. As it cannot happen without any cause so it necessarily implies its cause.
yad asyāḥ karaṇaṃ sa saṃskāra iti smṛtir ivārthapratītir api tatkāryatvāt tad anumāpikā bhavaty eva //	An impression is the cause par excellence of such knowledge. Thus, the knowledge of an object, depending on impression like memory, suggests that the impression is the cause.
yat tu kutas tādṛśaḥ saṃskāra udetīti jaḍapraśno 'yam anubhavahetukasya suprasiddhatvāt /	Now, a question arises, viz., "What is the cause of an impression ? This is a foolish question since it is well-known that an impression owes its origin to the apprehension of an object.

The sense of the question is that the apprehension of an object is presentative in its character. Hence, how can an impression bring it about? If it is effectuat- ed by an impression then it will be representative.
naiṣa niyamaḥ smṛter eva bījam iti /	There is no hard and fast rule that an impression shall produce memory only.
anubhavas tāvat tathāvidham ātmadharmam ādhatte /	The apprehension of an object produces a special kind of impression.

Various types of effects are explained only on the assumption of diverse types causes.
na sākṣād arthapratītikārī saṃskāraḥ /	We are not wedded to an opinion that an impression is the direct cause of the knowledge of the meaning of a word.

Thus, we may have the knowledge of the meaning of the said word through remote cause.796 the instrumentality of letters which areremembered and of the letter which is apprehended.

nanu anubhavakramāhitasaṃskārasāmarthyam anurudhyamānāḥ smṛtayo 'pi krameṇotpattum arhanti na yugapad iti /	Now, the Sphoţa-vādins raise a fresh problem. The letters of a word which are now past have not been simultaneously presented to our consciousness.
tataś ca prāktana eva doṣaḥ sāmastyābhāvād iti /	Thus the impression of each letter has been generated by the experience of each letter.
naiṣa doṣaḥ /	They hold that the above defects do not vitiate the said hypothesis.

These successive experiences gain strength and produce such an impression (i.e. work out such a qualitative change in the soul) as simultaneously recalls all letters which have been previously experienced in memory. Let a parallel case be cited to bring home the point in question.
saṃskārāt saṃskārotpattir alaukikīti cet nālaukikī svādhyāyādhyayane siddhatvāt / uccāraṇakriyāyāḥ kṣaṇikatvāt tadāhite saṃskārāntarakāriṇi saṃskāre'niṣyamāṇe 'ntyam uccāraṇaṃ prathamoccāraṇān na viśiṣyeteti /	The logical conclusion of the above hypothesis is that impression brings forth another well- developed impression. If the Naiyāyikas subscribe to this hypothesis then they assume something transcendental i.e., something which cannot be corroborated by visible facts. The Naiyāyikas join issue with their critics and emphatically assert that it is not transcendental.
tataḥ kim /	As such it is short-lived.

Any way we are to assume transcendental causality.

Please state the reasons for your parti- ality and aversion".
uktam atra tenaiva sugṛhītanāmnā bhāṣyakāreṇa śabdakalpanāyāṃ sā ca śabdakalpanā ca iti // nanu nāsti kalpanādvaigṇyam /	He has pointed out that if a sphota is assumed then one is to make two assumptions, viz., a sphota and an impression. 797 Now, the Sphota-vādins contend thus: 'We are not required to make double assumptions. An impression of the ordinary type is not a novel object.
saṃskāro hi yathāprasiddhi sthita eva /	It is a well-known object which is admitted by all.
kā tatra kalpanā /	Therefore, we make no new assumption.
na hi vayaṃ smaraṇaikakāraṇatvaṃ saṃskāradharmam atilaṅghitavantaḥ bhavanta iva //	We have not allowed an impression to go beyond its normal acti- vity. We firmly stick to the hypothesis that an impression exclusively produces memory.
kathaṃ na laṅghitavanto bhavantaḥ / sarvavarṇaviṣayaikasmaraṇakāritā bhavadbhir api kalpitaiva /	They say to the Sphota-vädins, "How is that you have not allowed an impression to go beyond its normal activity? You also admit that there is an impression that revives the memory of all letters at a time.
yaiva hi vartanī varṇānām arthapratītau saiva sphoṭavyaktāv api / tāṃ ca kalpayitvā śabdo 'nyaḥ kalpita evam /	The very same path which is adopted by letters to reveal the meaning of a word is also followed by them for the manifestation of a sphoța. You assume the hypothesis of an impression but over and above it you postulate the hypo- thesis of a peculiar sound.
ataś ca saṃskārasyobhayavādividitasya smaraṇakāritvam ullaṅghya arthapratiyayakāritvaṃ kevalam asmābhir abhihitam /	Thus, both of us agree to accept the hypothesis of impression. But we do not subscribe to the view that the only function of an impression is to revive memory. But we have only allowed an impression to transgress its limit and to produce the knowledge of the meaning of a word.
bhavadbhis tu mūlata evārabhyābhinavaṃ viśvam utthāpitam / apūrvasya śabdasya tāvad astitvaṃ punar varṇavyatiriktatvaṃ punar avayavaśahityaṃ kalpitam iti kathaṃ na kalpanāgurutvam /	You have postulated sphota-a class of transcen- dental sound. You also assume that the said sphota is distinct798 from letters and it is partless. How is it that your assumption does not suffer from cumbrousness?" Kumārila has also subjected the said hypothesis to a severe criticism.
tad uktam [sadbhāvavyatirekau ca tathāvayavavarjanam /	He says, "The Sphoța-vādins assume that a sphoţa exists and distinguishes itself from letters.
tavādhikaṃ bhavet tasmāt yatno 'sāv arthabuddhiṣu] iti //	A word consists of parts. Hence, they should also postulate that a sphoța is part- less.
yat punar avādi prathamavarṇabuddhivelāyām eva vyaktaṃ sphoṭatattvaṃ uttarottarabuddhibhir atiśayitatarapratyayaviṣayatāṃ nīyate ratnatattvavad iti sa eṣa viṣama upanyāsaḥ /	They review the arguments of the Sphota-vådins. The Sphota-vādins have held that when the initial letter is presented to our conscious- ness sphoța has become manifest and when the subsequent letters are known to us the awareness of the sphoța becomes distinctly vivid.
ratnasya hi sāvayavatvāt prathamapratyayāviṣayīkṛtasūkṣmatarāvayavaviśeṣagrāhiṇāṃ uttarottarapratyayānām asti tatrāvakāśaḥ /	Gem consists of parts. Hence all minute parts are not discovered by its first perception. Subsequent acts of perception reveal them. In this case subsequent acts of percep- tion have some important part to play.
sphoṭas tu varṇasvarūpavad anaṃśa iti tatsvarūpasarvasvam ādyenaiva varṇena vyaktam /	But a sphota is partless like a letter. Hence, the initial letter reveals it in its entirety.
kim idānīm anye varṇāḥ kariṣyanti / ekadeśavyaktis tu niravayavasya varṇasyeva na saṃbhavati /	What part will the subsequent letter play? A letter being partless, the partial manifestation of a letter is not possible.
yathoktam [alpīyasā 'pi yatnena śabdam uccāritaṃ matiḥ /	Kumārila has also said to this effect : If a letter is pro- nounced in a low voice, it is not heard at all.

They hold that though a group of Vedic hymns or a verse is presented to consciousness on its be- ing heard for the first time yet it is very clearly and vividly known when it is repeatedly heard. Similarly, though a sphotaSphota not manifested by a dhvani 799 is manifested by the first letter of a word yet it will be more vividly revealed by the other letters. The example, cited by them, bears no resemblance to a sphoța since it is absurd to think that a group of hymns or a verse consists of no parts.
kecid avayavā varṇātmanaḥ padātmano vā prathamāyāṃ buddhāv aparisphurantaḥ saṃsthābhyāsalabdhātiśayāyāṃ tasyāṃ prakaṭībhaviṣyanti /	Some parts are letters and some other parts are words. The first awareness fails to grasp them all. When they are heard again and again they are retained and are clearly and distinctly known to us.
sphoṭas tu ekavarṇa iva niraṃśa iti tatra ko buddher atiśayayogaḥ tasmād ayam api na saṃgato dṛṣṭāntaḥ //	But a sphoța is partless like an individual letter. Hence the awareness of a sphota knows no different degrees of vividness. It remains always the same. Therefore, the example in question is not appropriate.
ye 'pi ca manvate dhvanivyaṅgyatvāt sphoṭasya na tatra varṇavikalpāvasara iti /	The refutation of the hypothesis that a sphota is manifested by a dhvani. Those who hold that dhvanis manifest sphoțas but not letters are not sound judges.
te 'pi na samyag darśinaḥ /	The dilemma in question has been referred to in the last section.
parāṇūdya varṇapratītiṃ dhvanibhyaḥ śabdapratīter anutpādāt / atidrutocci cārayiṣayā 'nupalabhyamānavarṇavibhāgāc ca śabdād arthapratyayābhāvāt //	Though dhvanis which are very slow give rise to audible letters yet they fail to mani- fest sphotas. Again when we wish to pron unce words very quickly words thus pronounced, convey no meaning since letters, contained in each word, are not distinctly grasped.
atha dhvanayaḥ śabdavyaktim ādadhānāḥ sthānakaraṇānurodhenāsatyam eva varṇabhedam upadarśayanti śyāmādirūpam iva mukhasya khaṅgādṛya ity ucyate tad apy asat /	Now, the upholders of this hypothesis may contend that dhvanis, in order to manifest sphotas, hold up indistinctly pro- nounced letters with the help of organs of speech and the air just as we keep down a sword, a dirty mirror etc. which exhibit a distorted image of a face such as the dark complexion, the unusual length etc.
asatyatve nimittābhāvāt /	The above contention is not tenable.
tad atiriktas tu śabdo na pratīyate /	But a sphota which is distinct from letters is never presented to our consciousness.
yaś ca na pratīyate so 'sti ye ca pratīyante te na santīty ucyamāne śaśo nāsti visāṇam astīti syāt /	If one holds that an ob- ject which is not experienced exists and an object which is experienced does not exist then he talks like one who says that horns exist but a hare does not exist.
tasmād ayam api na kalpanāgauravaparihārakṣamaḥ panthāḥ /	The new path which has800 been adopted by you is not less cumbersome.

In other words, the hypo- thesis of a sphoța has in no way an advantage over the hypo- thesis that words communicate meanings. Hence there is no need of postulating the hypothesis of a sphota.
anye tu upalabdhyanantarasattākānāṃ varṇānām arthapratyāyakatvam ācakṣate tad iha neṣyate kṣaṇikatvād varṇānāṃ upalabdher ūrdhvaṃ sattānupapatteḥ /	The other thinkers i.e., the Mīmāmsakas, hold that as letters survive even after their presentation to consciousness so they communicate meanings without requiring the help of impres- sions. But we do not subscribe to this hypothesis since letters are transient.
sarvathā vyutpattyanusāreṇa varṇānām arthapratyāyakatvaṃ tad yathā purā dṛṣṭaṃ tathā ' bhyupagamyata iti / tad uktaṃ [yāvanto yādṛśāḥ] iti //	According to our training we know that letters communicate meanings. They do their function as they have been observed before to do it. Kumarila has also said to this effect: "As many letters, arranged in a particular order etc." This hypothesis has been viewed with disfavour by the Sphota-vădins.
yat tv atra pratīpam uktaṃ [kiyantaḥ kīdṛśāḥ] iti tatra pratītayaḥ praṣṭavyāḥ na tapasvino vayam iti yat kiṃcid etat //	They ask "How many letters, being arranged in which particular order, do convey meanings ?" We are poor fellows. We shall not be able to give the right answer. Please ask your own consciousness.
yat punar abhyadhāyi kramavyatyāsaprayuktā api varṇā pratyāyakā bhaveyuḥ / krama eva vā sphoṭaḥ syāt iti tad api na peśalam /	You have also said that either letters may communicate meanings even if they violate the tem- porary order of their arrangement or if the said order of letters is necessarily required then a sphota should be the temporary order of letters. Such a suggestion is not sound.
kramo hi nāma kālabhedaḥ /	A temporary order is nothing but the different strokes of time.
na ca kāla eva sphoṭo bhavitum arhati //	A sphoța cannot be identical with the different strokes of time.
kramo 'pi ca na svatantraḥ pratipādakaḥ padārthāntaravṛttir vā kin tu varṇāśrita eva /	The tem- porary order of letters does not independently communicate a meaning, Again, the temporary order of objects other than that of letters does not also communicate a meaning.
tatra coktam dvaye saty api tenātra vijñeyo 'rthasya vācakaḥ /	Kumarila has also discussed the problem thus :- There are two alternative suggestions viz.
varṇāḥ kin nu kramopetāḥ kin na varṇāśrayaḥ kramaḥ //	In other words, the letters arranged in an order of succession but not the mere order of succession convey the sense of a word.
kramaḥ kramavatām aṅgam iti kiṃ yuktisādhyatā / dharmamātram asau teṣāṃ na vastvantaram iṣyate //	There is no need of logical demonstration to establish it since the said order of succession is nothing but the property of the said letters.
tasmāt ye yāvat kramakā yam arthaṃ pratyāyanto dṛṣṭā varṇāḥ te tatkramakā varṇās tam arthaṃ pratyāyayiṣyantīti na sphoṭād arthāvagatiḥ /	Hence, the very letters which have been noticed to convey a particular meaning, being arranged in a particular order of succession, will also convey the same meaning, being arranged in the same order. Thus, a sphota is not an inference.
tad evaṃ kāryānumānaṃ arthāpattir vā na sphoṭasiddhaye prabhavatīti siddham //	We do not infer it as we do a cause from an effect. It is not also a presumption.
yad apy abhāṇi [śabdād arthaṃ pratipadyāmahe] iti vyavahāraḥ sphoṭapakṣasākṣitām ālambata iti tad api asāram / varṇānāṃ vācakatve yathoktanītyā sādhite tatpakṣe 'pi tathā vyavahāropapatteḥ //	The refutation of the hypothesis that a sphota is perceptible. The sphota-vādins have also argued that as it is generally admitted by usage that a meaning has been communicated by a single sabda so the usage in question points to the hypothesis of sphota.
nanu katham upapattiḥ /	Such an argument is not sound.
saṃskāras tāvat na śabdaśabdenocyate /	The word 'sabda' does not denote an impression (samskära).
na hi tathā loke prasiddhiḥ / saṃskāre ca vācake vyutpattir api durupapādā /	In this world it is not well-known that the word 'sabda' deno- tes an impression. No body can prove by means of any method that the said word denotes an impression.
parāvagatipūrvikā hi śabdāt svāvagatiḥ /	A person, ignorant of the meaning of a word, learns the meaning of a word when he is instructed by another person in its meaning.
na ca parasthaḥ saṃskāraḥ parasya pratītim upajanayan grahītuṃ śakyaḥ parokṣatvāt //	No body can detect such a causal relation since an impression is a transcendental object.

If it signifies each individual letter then the word 'sabda',802. should communicate no meaning since an individual letter con- veys no meaning. Moreover, it should not denote an aggregate of letters since the word 'sabda' is a class name, i.e.
dvivacanabahuvacanāntavyaktiśabdaprayoge hi tasmāt sāmānādhikaraṇyena na jātiśabda ekavacanāntaḥ prayujyate /	If we use proper names in the dual or plural number then a common noun in the singular number cannot be used as a case in apposition with either of them.

Now, the critics may contend that as the word 'forest' denot- es a collection of trees so the word 'Śabda' signifies a collection of letters. As the verbal usage that a forest is trees is seen so the usage that a sabda is 'g', 'au' and 's' will be appropriate. Such a contention is not tenable.
atha brūyāt [āmrādayo vanam] ity abhedenāpi vanaśabdaḥ prayujyate /	A collection is held to be identical with the objects collected under it. Some verbal usages point to this direction.
tatheha [gakārādayaḥ śabdaḥ] iti prayokṣyate /	The verbal usage, viz., this is a Šabda of 'g' 'au', etc.
etad api nāsti /	is cons- picuous by its absence.
vanādau bhedavyapadeśavaśena prativyakti cāprayoge siddhe samudāyaśabdatve samudāyasamudāyinor abhedopacārāt [āmrādayo vanam] iti yujyate prayoktum /	Again, you may contend that the word 'forest' points to the identity of the aggregate of objects with the objects included in the aggregate since a verbal usage that the mango trees are nothing but a forest is noticed. A sentence that the letters 'g' etc.

But such a verbal usage is not noticed. Again, we distinguish the mango trees etc.
ucyate / kim anenopapannenānupapannena vā kṛtyam / yady ayam upapadyate tataḥ kim / athāpi nopapadyate tato 'pi kim /	Can we identify popular usage with any proof? We have already refuted the thesis that a sphota is an influence. We shall also prove that a sphoţa is not perceived.
na hi lokavyapadeśanibandhanā vastusthitir bhavati //	A sphota lies beyond the range of other proofs.
nanu śāstrakārā apy evam eva vyavaharanti [bhāvam ākhyātenācaṣṭe] iti /	Therefore the Sphota-vădins take vain pride in citing the popular usage "A Sabda communicates meaning to us".

śāstrakāravyavahārād apy aprāmāṇiko 'rthaḥ śakyate 'bhyupagantum /	If we uphold the thesis that a letter communicates a meaning then the said popular usage stands justified.
katarac cedaṃ pramāṇaṃ lokavyapadeśo nāma /	The reason is as follows.
anumānaṃ tāvat pratikṣiptam / pratyakṣam api pratikṣepsyate /	The last letter accompanied by the impressions of the preceding letters conveys meaning.
na cānyat sphoṭasiddhau pramāṇaṃ kramate tad asthāne 'yaṃ lokavyapadeśanirūpaṇena sphoṭāṭopaḥ //	The thesis that letters, referred to by a recognitive judgment, communicate meaning suffers from no defect since the word *Sabda' not employed here to denote such letters as are in-Nyāyamanjari dividually taken into consideration.
na cātyantam asaṅgato 'yaṃ varṇapakṣe laukiko vyapadeśaḥ /	Let us take a concrete example, e.
pūrvavarṇajanitasaṃskārasahite tāvad antyavarṇe vācake susaṅgata evāyaṃ vyapadeśaḥ tasya śabdatvāt ekatvāc ca //	g., the word 'gauh'. The collection of letters 'g', 'au' and 's' which is not other than the word 'gauh' communicates a meaning. A word which denotes a collection has singular number.
saṃkalanāpratyayopārūḍhavarṇavācakatvapakṣe 'pi na doṣaḥ /	(In Sanskrit grammar there is no hard and fast rule that the subject and the predicate of a proposition should have the same number.
na hi bhedaśabdasahita eṣa śabdaśabdaḥ prayujyate [gakārādibhyaś śabdād arthaṃ pratipadyāmahe] iti /	So, the proposition that such and such letters are 'śabda' is quite appropriate. Here, the word 'Sabda' denotes a collection of letters.
kevalas tu jātiśabda ekavacanānto bahuṣv api varṇeṣu na viruddhaḥ //	It has singular number. It may be predicated of the subject, such and such letters.
kiṃ ca sphoṭapakṣe sutarām anupapanno 'yaṃ vyapadeśaḥ [śabdāt] iti prātipadikārthasyābhāvāt /	Moreover, the mention of the statement, "We make out a meaning from Sabda" is highly illogical on the part of the Sphota-vādins.
na hi varṇavat sphoṭe śabdaśabdaṃ prayuṃjāno dṛśyate vyavahartṛjanaḥ // arthapratipattihetutvaṃ śabdalakṣaṇam asādhu dhūmādibhir vyabhicārāt /	No linguists are seen to employ the word Sabda' to denote a sphoţa as they are noticed to use it in the sense of a letter. The Sphoța-vadins may contend that Šabda is defined as the indicator of an object. This contention is hard- ly tenable since the definition is too wide.
athāpi prakramaparyālocanayā śrautragrāhyatvaviśiṣṭam arthapratipattihetutvaṃ śabdalakṣaṇam abhidhīyate /	Now, the Sphota-vādins, having reflected on the problem from its initial stage, may revise the said definition and hold that Sabda is such as being audible indicates an object.
tad idaṃ sphoṭaṃ prati na siddham tasya śrautrapratyayaviṣayatvābhāvāt /	But this definition is not applicable to a sphota since a sphota is not audible.
śrotragrāhyatvam eva ca taditaravyavacchedakṣamam iti tad eva yuktaṃ kim ubhayopādānena /	Hence, the shorter definition is logically sound. The definition in ques- tion should not consist of two elements necessary and super- fluous.
śrotragrāhyatvaṃ ca varṇeṣv eva nārthāntarasyeti varṇā eva śabdāḥ /	Letters are only audible but no other objects. There- fore letters are only Sabda. A sphota is not Sabda.

śrotragrāhyatvaṃ śabdalakṣaṇaṃ sattādāv api astīti cet na śrotreṇaivety avadhāraṇasya vivakṣitatvāt //	The intended difinition is this "What is only audible is Śabda." The adverb 'only' which denotes exclusion has not been appropriately given since śabda is not exclusively heard by means of ears.
śrotramanobhyāṃ grahaṇād asiddham avadhāraṇam iti cet na /	Thus, the definition implies that the sense-perception of Sabda is produced only by ears but not by such other sense- organs.
samānajātīyavyavacchedārthatvād avadhāraṇasya cakṣurādīny eva tena vyavacchedyante na manaḥ //	Hence, eyes etc. are only excluded but not the inter- nal organ viz., manas.

jātimattve satīti prakramalabhyaviśeṣāpekṣaṇāt /	The trend of this discus- sion from its very beginning requires the further qualification as has been proposed just now.
stanayitnunādaprabhṛtibhir api na vyabhicāraḥ teṣāṃ śabdatvābhyupagamāt /	This definition will not be too wide even if it applies to the thundering of clouds or to other inarticulate sounds since they all belong to the class of sound.
tad uktam bhāṣyakṛtā [dvividhaś cāyaṃ śabdaḥ varṇātmā dhvanimātraś ca] iti //	Vätsyāyana, the author of Nyâya-bhäşya, has stated that sound admits of two kinds viz., letters and inarticulate sound.
arthapratyāyakatvaṃ tu na lakṣaṇam ity uktam agṛhītasaṃbandha varṇātmāny api śabde tadabhāvenāśabdatvaprasaṅgāt /	We are still ignorant of the relation of denota- tion. Hence, the above sound carries no sense. As it communi-806 Nyāyamañjart cates no sense, it ceases to be sound since according to the said definition every sound points to an object.
kālāntareṇa saṃbandhabuddhau satyāṃ ca tasyaiva śabdatvam iti avyavasthitam idaṃ lakṣaṇam //	When the rela- tion of denotation has been known to us after some time the same thing again becomes sound since it conveys now a sense to us.

Why do you imagine the identity of sabda with universal, attributes, actions etc. i.e., objects denoted by words? Why does this misgiving arise in your mind? Why do you refute the imaginary identity ? We fail to appreciate the value of your useless attempts.

Hence, those who hold that letters constitute words, sentence etc. and convey a meaning can only justify the popu- lar view "We make out a sense from a sound (Sabda)". Hence the popular view goes in favour of the varņa-vădins but does not favour the sphoța-vādins.

They also state that every body is aware of the fact that sound produces an awareness of common element which finds expression in the verbal sign ‘a word, a sentence etc.' But they also point out that the auditory sense-perception pro- duced by a sound, does not refer to letters.
na yuktam uktam /	Such a hypothesis is not logically sound.
iha hi śābaleyādau pratipiṇḍaṃ gaur iti buddhir upajāyamānā sakalapiṇḍasādhāraṇaṃ rūpaṃ viṣayīkarotīti gotvasāmānyaṃ tad iṣyate /	The reason behind our criticism is as follows. Whenever we perceive individual cows, viz., Śâbaleya, Bahuleya etc. we recognise a common property in each of them and name it as the universal of cowness.
evaṃ yadi prativarṇaṃ padaṃ padam iti vākyaṃ vākyaṃ iti matir upajāyeta jātivat tarhi padaṃ vākyaṃ ca sarvavarṇavṛtti kim api rūpam avagacchema na tv evam asti pratītiḥ /	Similarly, if we had recognised a word or a sentence in every letter then we would have admitted that a word or a sentence is a type of common property which belongs to every letter. But, as a matter of fact such an awareness does not occur to our mind.
yathā ca tantvādyavayavaparighaṭṭitapaṭādikāryaviṣayam ādyanayanasamaya eva bhedagraharahitam avayavijñānam udeti tathā kramasamuccaradekaikavarṇasvarūpopagrahanirapekṣaṃ yadi padam iti vākyam iti jñānaṃ bhavet tat padādikam avayavinam iva padaṃ vākyam ekaikarūpam anumanyemahi na tv evam asti /	Similarly, do we hear a word or sentence without attend- ing to each constituent letter one after another? If we had heard a word or a sentence as a distinct whole without having the distinct auditory perception of each of its constituent letters then we would have gladly accepted the thesis "A word or a sentence stands on the same footing with a piece of cloth." As a piece of cloth is constituted by its parts so a word or a sente- nce is not framed by its parts. A word or a sentence does not inhere in letters. It is not a common whole which is shared by all letters.
na hi tantubhir iva paṭaḥ vīraṇair iva kaṭaḥ varṇaiḥ padam ārabhyate //	We do never grasp it as a whole at a time. 807 Now, the Naiyãyikas refute the thesis of the Sphota-vädins.
yat tu gaur gaur ity evaṃjñānam abhedagrāhi dṛśyate tad ekājupādheḥ /	They now criticise it and point out that the perception of a persisting same element owes its origin to an adjunct, viz., a single vowel.
bhinnājupaśleṣe tu devadatta ityādau nānākṣaragrahaṇam eva vilambitam anubhūyate / na caivaṃ paṭādibuddhiṣu tadavayavāḥ kadācit vicchedenāvabhāsante /	But if words consist of many vowels, e. g., Devadatta etc. then many letters are but slowly perceived by us. Thus, when a peace of cloth is presented to our consci- ousness its parts are not cognised as separate from its whole.
tasmān nāvayavīva jātir iva vā padaṃ vākyam abhinnam avabhāsate //	Hence, when a word or a sentence is presented to our consci- ousness a same identical object is not grasped like a universal or a whole.
nanu ca yāsau śabdaśabdāt buddhiḥ saiveyaṃ sphoṭabuddhiḥ // kim idānīm / yad eva śabdatvasāmānyaṃ sa eva sphoṭaḥ maivam /	Now, the Sphoța-vädins contend that consciousness which arises from the generic form of a word but not from its specific form is called the awareness of Sphota. Now, the Naiyâyikas ask, "Do you hold that the universal of sound (soundness) is same as Sphoţa? They point out, you cannot answer in the affirmative: A Sphota has a distinct entity.
sphoṭa evāsau na śabdatvaṃ sāmānyaṃ tat /	It is not identical with the universal of sound.
sāmānyaṃ hi tad ucyate yatraikavyaktidarśane vyaktyantarānusandhānam śābaleyagrahaṇe bāhuleyasyeva /	A universal is called common property (sāmânya) because when a particular is perceived another particular of the same class is remembered. When we see a particular cow, called Sabaleya we remember another particular cow, named Bāhuleya.
iha tu na gakāragrahaṇe na vakārānusandhānam iti nedaṃ sāmānyam /	But, in the present case, if the letter 'g' is presented to our consciousness, the letter 'au' is not remembered. Hence, Sabdatva is not a universal.
ekarūpas tv ayaṃ pratibhāsaḥ śandatattvaviṣaya eva /	This consciousness points to the same object, viz., theNyāyamañjari fact of being a sound.
śabdatattvaṃ ca sphoṭa ity ucyate //	Therefore, a sphota is nothing but a sound in general.
amunaiva hi bhayena kaiścit sphoṭaśaṅkibhiḥ śabdatvasāmānyam apahnutam /	They point out that some thinkers of the sphota- school, being apprehensive of the existence of a sphota, have hesitated to identify a sound in its generic character with the universal of sound.
asthāna eva tv ayaṃ saṃtrāsaḥ /	But their apprehension has been misplaced.
na hi śabdatvaṃ sphoṭaḥ / prativarṇaṃ hi śabdaḥ śabda iti buddhir asti na ca varṇasphoṭaḥ /	It is a truism that the universal of sound is not a sphoța. When each letter is cognised it is presented to our consciousness as a sound. A letter is not a sphota.
tad idaṃ śabdatvasāmānyam eva śabdabuddher ālambinam na sphoṭaḥ //	The piece of consciousness which is expressed in the verbal form 'sound' refers to the universal of sound but not to a sphota.
sāmānyasiddhau tu vyaktyantarānusandhānam akāraṇam iti prāg eva nirṇītam /	Jayanta has also conclusively proved the hollowness of the thesis that when a particular of a class is grasped by one another particular of the same class is necessarily remembered.
tasmānn aśabdabuddhāv api sphoṭo 'vabhāsate padavākyabuddhyā viveti //	Therefore, a sphoţa is not referred to by such consciousness as is expressed by the term 'a sound'.
ekaś ca satyam āha yad iyam ekakāryakāritvanibandhanā vanapṛtanādibuddhisamānayogakṣemaiva padavākyabuddhir iti /	It has been rightly said that the knowledge of words and sen- tences bears the stamp of sameness because they conjointly produce one and the same effect. It resembles the knowledge of a forest or an army.
na ca jātyādibuddhiṣv asamāśvāsaḥ vailakṣaṇyasya darśitatvāt //	A sphoța does not bear a resemb- lance to a universal. Their distinction has been noted before.

Again, the awareness of the identity of a word with a sentence is the source of the communication of the same meaning. It is not fair to overlook the above fallacy.
smaryamāṇānubhūyamānavarṇajanitaiveyam arthapratītir ity avocāma nābhinnapadaparicchedapūrviketi kuta itaretarāśrayatvam brūyāt padavākyayor ekatvam antareṇa katham padavākyārthapratītir ekarūpā bhavet iti so 'yam atīva mugdhālopaḥ /	Therefore, how does the hypothesis of the critics involve the fallacy of a vicious circle? 809 The Sphota-vădins may now contend that if a word is not identical with a sentence then how is it that the consciousness of an object, denoted by a word, forms an integral part of a judgment, expressed by a sentence? The assumption that a word and a sentence are identical is a foolish one.
pratītibhedābhedau hi viṣayabhedābhedāv anurudhyete nopāyabhedābhedau /	If objects are iden- tical or different then and then only their corresponding acts of consciousness are identical or different.

It is a long-standing hypothesis that the acts of cons- ciousness which refer to the same object are identical.
na tv ekaṃ padaṃ yat kāraṇam iti / vākyārthabuddher apy ekatvāt eko vākyārtho bhavatu na tv ekam vākyam /	If acts of consciousness are the same then the objects referred to by them should be the same But one cannot subscribe to the view that several acts of consciousness are same because one and the same word has produced all of them.
vargīkaraṇakāraṇaṃ kramabhāvināṃ bahūnāṃ varṇānām etat bhavati yat ekārthapratipādakatvaṃ na tv abhedam eva padavākyayor gamayatīti //	But we should not think that they all are similar because they have been produced by one and the same sentence. Many consecutive letters convey an object as their meaning. But they do not point to the identity of a word with a sentence.

Their illusion lies in their assumption that a word and its meaning are identical. We have established with strong argument that a word is absolutely different from its object. Our very experience contradicts the attributed identity of a word with its meaning.
tasmāt pratyakṣagamyo 'pi na sphoṭa iti siddham //	Hence, we do not accept such aNyayamanjari theory.

Two judgments will differ if their objects are different; and two judgments are identical if they refer to the same object.
yat tu niravayavatvam ucyate tad atīva saṃvitparāmarśakaiśalaśūnyaṃ vyāhṛtam aṃśās santi na santīti cintā 'tyantam asaṅgatā /	But they point out at the same time that though the said object is a unified whole yet it admits of parts. But those who hold that a sentence conveys a partless whole have no sound theory of knowledge.
niraṃśas tv asti nāstīti yuktam cintayituṃ satām //	The question whether a part exists or not is highly imperti- nent.
padatadarthabhedasya prativākyaṃ vispaṣṭam ābhāsamānatvat anupagṛhyamāṇāvayavavibhāgayoś ca vākyavākyārthayor anavabhāsamānatvāt //	But sound thinkers should discuss the problem whether the meaning of a sentence consists of parts or of no parts. In every sentence a word is distinguished from the sentence itself and the meaning of a word is differentiated from that of a sentence.
astv avayavapratītiḥ sā tu bhrānteti cet na /	Such a contention does not hold good since a judgment which is contradicted is illusory but if it does not meet with contradiction, it is not illusory.
bādhakābhāvāt /	An illusion is not baseless.
bhrānteś ca bījaṃ kim api vaktavyam /	The Sphota-vadins should mention some ground for its falsity.
sādṛśyam iti cet kasya keneti na vidmaḥ /	They may say that the knowledge of a sentence having parts is false because it bears resemblance to an illusory judgment.
yadi hi kvacin mukhyā avayavāḥ prasiddhā bhaveyuḥ tatsādṛśyāt itaratra tadabhāve 'pi bhrama iti gamyeta na tv evam asti sarvavākyānām apy abhāgatvāt /	It appears to be possessed of parts owing to its likeness to a sentence having parts. If the Sphota- vādins argue in this way then they must admit that there is a sentence which has parts. But they do not make such an admission since they hold that all sentences are partless.
narasiṃhe 'pi narāvayavāḥ siṃhāvayavāś ca pṛthak pṛthak pratyabhijñāyante /	Even in the body of a man-lion the two parts maintain their distinc- tion and are presented to consciousness as distinct.
tadvad ihāpi abhyupagamyamāne nūnaṃ kvacid vākye satyatvam avayavānām eṣitavyam //	Hence, a man-lion is not the instance of a partless whole. Hence, it must be admitted that there are parts in a sentence.

In a drink the taste of each ingredient such as Năga-kesara etc. is distinctly felt. In different forms of music In a the different notes of a scale are distinctly heard. Therefore, F these are not illustrations of partless wholes.

They also point out that the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence is also partless since every form of consciousness is partless.
buddhiviṣayīkṛtas tv artho dṛṣṭāntadṛṣṭāntikayoḥ sāvayava eva /	But an object which is referred to by our consciousness and which is either an illustration or is illustrated is only possessed of parts.

yad apy abhyadhāyi vṛddhavyavahārataḥ saṃbandhabuddhiḥ vākyavākyārthayor eva na padatadarthayoḥ padena vyavahārābhāvād iti tad apy asādhu /	From the usage of the experienced persons the relation of deno- tation obtaining between a word and its meaning is learnt but not that holding between a word and its meaning. We cannot express an idea by means of a word. The above thesis is not tenable since in order to know the relation of denotation holding between a sentence and its meaning the meaning of a word cannot be dispensed with.
vākyād api vyutpattir bhavantī padaparyantā bhavati /	If a man is acquainted with words and their meanings then he can even make out the meaning of a sentence newly constructed.

In order to know the meaning of a sentence we must admit that a sentence is divisible into words and each word has its meaning. The Sphota-vãdins have also stated that mere words are never employed and words, for this reason, enjoy no real ex- istence.
sāpi nāpekṣiṣyate /	Such a thesis is not tenable.
itarathā hi sā 'vaśyam apekṣyeta //	Let us cite a concrete case in support of our criticism.
mahāvākyasthāne avāntaravākyaṃ na prayujyata iti tad apy asatyaṃ syāt /	When a big complex sentence is employed, subordinate clauses are not' independently used.

There are a few sentences the meaning of which is obtained through the context. Even, in these cases, words play an important part since they are uttered to convey such matters as are beyond the reach of a context.
granthagrahaṇāvasareṣu ca svarūpāvadhāraṇam api phalavad varṇānām /	Now, the Sphota-vādins make another suggestion in favour of their thesis.
mā vā phalavattvaṃ padavarṇānāṃ bhūt tathāpi rathāvayavānām iva rathakāryeṣv aparyāptaśaktīnām api svarūpasattvam anirvāryam /	Similarly, when a sentence is read out one may not realise the distinct indiv duality of letters or words. In the face of this suggestion the Naiyāyikas strongly assert that letters and words must have a necessary place in a sentence just as parts of a chariot occupy a necessary place in the chariot though they cannot discharge its function.
kāryāntarāya rathāt rathāvayavāḥ prabhavantīti cet padavarṇā api kāryāntare prabhaviṣyanti /	Now, it may be contended that parts of a chariot are necessary because they render some other service which a chariot cannot do.
rathakāryaikadeśamātrāṃ kām api rathāvayavāḥ kuruvantīti yady ucyate padāny api vākyakāryaikadeśaṃ kam api kurvanty eva /	The parts of a chariot make a partial contribution towards the function of a chariot. Do letters or words make any such contribution? Yes, letters or words also make a partial contribution towards the function of a sentence.
varṇā api kecid arthavanto bhavanty eva /	Some letters of a sentence are significant byA Word or a Sentence not Partless 813 themselves.
tasmān nāsantaḥ padavarṇāḥ //	Therefore, letters and words are not creatures of our imagination.

Such an objection expresses the unprecedented scholarship of the said objectors.
na hi ghatāḥ sāvayavā iti paramāṇubhir api sāvayavair bhavitavyam /	A jar is a whole consisting of parts. On that ground one can- not hold that an atom should consist of parts.

yad yathopalabhyate tat tathā bhavati /	An object possesses only such nature as is revealed through cognition.
yad yathā nopalabhyate tat tathā na bhavati /	An object does not possess such nature as is not presented to our consciousness.

tathā hy uktam etat /	Kumärila has also said to this effect.
[alpanīyasā 'pi yatnena śabdam uccāritaṃ matiḥ /	If a letter is slowly uttered, it is not at all grasped.
yadi vā naiva gṛhṇāti varṇaṃ vā sakalaṃ sphuṭam] iti //	He also states that nobody should postulate a whole having parts if its parts are never cognised.
tasmāt bāliśacoditam idaṃ varṇasyāpy avayavā bhavantu padavākyayor api vā mā bhūvann iti //	Therefore, letters are partless wholes. Therefore, it is a foolish statement that a letter should have also parts like a word or a sentence.

If the same logic is applied then the conclusion that a word consists of parts is arrived at, It is also understood that the stem of a word and its suffix are real. These parts of a word are not merely imaginary.
vṛkṣaṃ vṛkṣeṇety atra prakṛtyarthānugame pratyayārtho bhidyate / vṛkṣaṃ ghaṭam iti pratyayārthānugama prakṛtyartho bhidyate /	In the inflectional words 'vçkşam' 'vşkşeņa' etc. the stem has the same meaning but the case-endings are different. In the infl- ectional words ‘vṛkşam', 'ghatam etc.
tatra yo 'rtho yaṃ śabdam anugacchati sa tasyārtha ity avasīyate /	In those cases the meaning which a particular word denotes is expressed by it (the word).
tat katham asatyā bhāgāḥ yat punaḥ kūpasūpayūpādau saty api varṇānugame 'rthānugame na dṛśyate /	How can one say that these parts are unreal ? The Sphota-vadins have argued in favour of the reality of aNyayamanjari sphota that though the words 'kūpa’, ‘sūpa’, ‘yūpa' etc.
tena cākāraṇam arthapratīter varṇānugama ity uktam tad ayuktam /	The drift of this argument is that the letters, contained in a word, do in no way contribute towards the communication of the meaning of the word.
yato nānvayavyatirekābhyām anutpannā pratītir utpādyate yena kūpādau tadutpādanam āśaṅkyeta /	The mere presence or absence of similar letters does not help to convey a meaning which a word does not denote. If only similar letters had determined the meaning of a word then the words 'küpa' etc.

If, in a particular case, the constituent letters of a word are similar then it will not be reasonable to enforce the conclusion that in other cases all constituent letters are similar though some of them are not so.

Hence, one cannot arrive at the conclu- sion that a group of letters does not condition the communica- tion of the meaning of a word. We do not definitely know the exact cause of the above heap of dust since it may be raised by horses or by young camels or by elephants.
karikarabhaturagaprabhṛtīnāṃ tu pratyekaṃ vyabhicāre 'pi bahuprāṇirūpasāmānyānapāyāt tatkāraṇam eva dhūlīpaṭalam avagamyate //	But still it is unmistakably true that the said heap of dust has been raised by many animals since heaps of dust which have been raised either by horses or by camels or by elephants are similar.

The words 'aśva' and 'karņa' convey their sense when they remain either compounded or uncompounded. But if the compound word formed by them expresses a conventio- nal meaning then its constituent words lose all their signifi- cance. Let us illustrate the point that the components of the compound word ‘aśva-karṇa' are significant when they do not form a compound word.
[aśvam āroha] [karṇe kuṇḍalaṃ] iti vyastayoḥ prayogaḥ /	The compound word 'aśvakarṇaḥ' is expressive816 of its meaning, viz., the ear of a horse.
turagaśrotre tu pratipipādayiṣite [aśvakarṇaḥ] iti samastaprayogo 'pi tadarthāparityāgī dṛśyate iti na sarvātmanā nirarthakā bhāgāḥ // yat punar anvākhyānavisaṃvādāt prakṛtipratyayavibhāganiyamo nāvakalpate iti etad api na yuktam āptataroktīnāṃ prāmāṇyāt /	Thus, we see that component words which constitute a compound word are not absolutely meaningless, The Sphota-vādins have also stated that the analysis of a word into its elements is not logical since the interpreters agree to differ from one another with regard to the said analysis of a word. Hence, the division of a word into a stem and a suffix does not hold good. This criticism is not sound.
trimunivyākaraṇam iti pāṇinimatam eva hi prakṛtipratyayavibhāgaṃ avitathaṃ pratyeṣyāmaḥ /	As a person places his confidence in the statement of the authoritative persons, SO the illustration "tri-muni Vyakaraṇam" admits of an analysis.
kiyaty api cāṃśe prāyeṇa sarveṣām anvākhyāt•ṇām avivādaḥ / vikaraṇādivisaṃvādamātraṃ tv akiṃcitkaram /	In many details of analysis the interpreters agree. They only differ from one another in vikaraņas (signs of the different classes of verbs), etc. Such differences are insignificant.
ataḥ pāramārthikatvāt prakṛtipratyayāṃśayoḥ na kalpanāmātreṇa pṛthakkaraṇam //	There- fore, the analysis of a word into its stem and suffix is really true. One cannot suggest a novel analysis by mere imagination.

They cite an example "kälenadantināgāḥ" in support of their criticism.
nāmatve 'pi [sa] iti [rāma] iti ca dve pade /	There are two sentences "kälena dantināgāḥ" and "käle nadanti nāgāḥ".
tayor anyad rūpam /	A section of grammar deals with accents.
saha rāmeṇa vartata ity ekapade 'pi anyad rūpam ity abhiyogaviśeṣavatāṃ sarvaṃ subhagam iti nāśakyaḥ padavibhāgaparicchedaḥ //	If the word 'sarāmaḥ' stands for two words, viz., 'sah' and 'Rāmaḥ' then words and their accents are different. If it is a compound word denoting one co-existing with Răma then the word itself and its accent are also different.

Hence, it is easy to understand the analysis of a sentence. The Sphota-vadins have also stated in continuation of their criticism that in the examples "Dadhyatra”, “Madhvatra”,817 Sphota not a Perception etc.

This is the teaching of the science of grammar that the words 'dadhy' and 'madhy' will respectively convey the same meaning as is respectively expressed by the words 'dadhi' and 'madhu'. Hence, the words, in spite of their euphonic changes, will convey their meaning.

The critics think that imaginary objects are also means to the real things. They cite examples in order to prove their hypothesis. They hold that false snake- bite and similar imaginary events bring about the effects of actual ones. If the examples are critically examined then we see that, truly speaking, false snake-bite is not the cause of the state of unconsciousness.
śaṅkā hi nāma buddhiḥ /	An apprehension is a form of consciousness.
buddhiś ca na na kāraṇam / na cāsatī buddhiḥ /	It is not true that consciousness does not produce an effect. Moreover, an act of consciousness is not an imaginary object.

Though they respectively end in 'y' and 'v' yet they will convey the same sense as is denoted by the original words. This is the teaching of the science of grammar that the words 'dadhy' and 'madhy' will respectively convey the same meaning as is respectively expressed by the words 'dadhi' and 'madhu'.

It is the apprehension of taking poison that is the cause of such state. An apprehension is a form of consciousness. It is not true that consciousness does not produce an effect.

Written letters are nothing but lines drawn on writing materials. These lines in themselves are not falsc. When they are taught by the trustworthy teachers such as khandika, a reputed teacher mentioned in the ancient literature, the disciples receive proper training and have deep-rootedNyayamanjari impression of these scripts.

But in the case of a sentence, as some of the antecedent letters ceased to exist long before so it is very difficult to remember them in their due order. Hence, it is impossible and unprecedented to hold that such letters are recalled in memory and combined to form a sentence.
vyavahitapadoccāraṇe tu dṛśyate vā vākyārthapratītiḥ yatra pūrvavarṇānusandhānagandho 'pi nāsti /	Moreover, though words which compose a sentence are uttered at intervals yet they are experienced to con- vey the sense of the said sentence. In this case there is no cha- ce of the recollection of the antecedent letters.

Now if these letters are uttered only once then it will be unreasonable to hold that they simultaneously discharge both functions since they are incapable of doing them (func- tions).

tasmāt padārthapratipādanaparyavasitasāmarthyāni padāni / padārthebhyas tu vākyārthapratyaya iti siddham //	Words fully exhaust their capacities in order to convey their meanings. Therefore, it is established that the meanings of words communicate the meaning of a sentence.

Moreover, the totality of the awarenesses of all words which constitute a sentence does not invariably precede the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence.

Though the meanings of all constituent words are not armed with the knowledge of universal concomitance yet they become combined with one another, taking into con-Meanings of Words, their scope sideration mutual requirement, proximity and material non- contradiction (yogyatã).

Thus, as the meaning of a sentence is conveyed through the agency of the meanings of constituent words so the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence is not a piece of verbal knowledge. Such a conclusion may be anticipated but does not turn out to be true.
śabdāt padārthapratipattau vākyārthapratipattir iti sarvam anavadyam / tad uktam [padāni hi svaṃ svam artham abhidhāya nivṛttavyāpārāṇi /	Words communicate their meanings. The conscious- ness of such meanings is followed by the knowledge of the mean- ning of a sentence. Therefore, the conclusion that the know- ledge of the meaning of a sentence is verbal is free from all defects.

atrāpy abhidhīyate na padārthebhyo vākyārthāvagatiḥ api tu vākyād eva /	Meanings of words do not convey the meaning of a sentence. But a sentence conveys its own meaning. Then reason behind the above remark is as follows.
tathā cāyaṃ vākyārtha iti prasiddhiḥ na padārthārtha iti /	It is well-known that this is the meaning of a sentence. Nobody says that this is the meaning of words.
yathā hi kālpanikavarṇasamūhātmakaṃ padaṃ padārthapratipattim ādadhāti tathā kālpanikapadasamūhātmakaṃ vākyaṃ vākyārthapratipattim ādhāsyati //	It is imagined that a word is a collection of letters, such a word which is no better than the collection of letters conveys its meaning. Similarly,a sentence which is an imaginary collection of words will also communi- cate its meaning.
nanu padasamūhātmakaṃ vākyam anyan nāsti kin tu padāny eva vākyam / padānāṃ ca svārthe caritārthatvāt na vākyārthasāmartyam ity uktam naitad yuktam padārthānām api caritārthatvāt /	Now, the upholders of the hypothesis under criticism may contend that there is no such sentence as is a collection of words and is distinct from the so-called constituent words. These words themselves are equivalent to a sentence. And they satis- fy an obligation when they communicate their own meaning.
kva teṣāṃ caritārthatvam / svapratipattau //	How do they fulfil an obligation? They have completed their task by producing their own knowledge.
nanu padāni svapratipattau caritārthībhūya padārthapratipattim ādadhati / punas tāny eva kathaṃ vākyārthapratipattim ādhāsyanti / padārthas tu svāvagater ūrdhvaṃ na kvacit paratra caritārthā iti vākyārthabuddher vidhātāro bhavantu /	How can a word discharge twofold duties which are distinct by their nature? But our hypothesis does not suffer from this defect since the meaning of a word, having produced its own consci- ousness, does not engage itself in discharging some other duty. Hence, the meanings of words should convey the meaning of a sentence." The critics point out that the above contention is not logically tenable.
naitad evam antyapadasyānyatra caritārthatvābhāvāt //	The last word of a sentence has not fulfilled its mission as it has not some other task.
antyapadam eva pūrvapadasmaraṇopakṛtaṃ vākyam ucyate / tadarthaś ca pūrvapadārthaviśiṣṭo vākyārtha ity eke /	The last word of a sentence, being benefited by the recollection of its antecedent words, is called a sentence. Some say that the meaning of the last word, being mutually related to the rest of its antecedent words, is known as the meaning of a sentence.
tasmāt vākyād eva vākyārthapratyayaḥ //	Hence, the meaning of a sentence is conveyed only by a sentence.
kin tu kim ekasaṃskārasmaraṇena kāryadvayaṃ padāni vidadhāti vibhinnasaṃskāreṇa vā iti tatra kāryabhedāt kāraṇabhedānumānam iti prasiddha eṣa panthā /	Let us dis- cuss some of them. Do words discharge double functions, viz., the communication of its own meaning and that of the mean- ing of a sentence the strength of recollection which due to a single impression ? Or, do they do these two duties by means of different impressions? Let us clarify the purport of the ques- tions.

kramo 'py eṣām īdṛśaḥ yat prathamaṃ padārtham avagamayanti tato vākyārtham / so 'yaṃ tarhi padārthapūrvaka eva vākyārtha ukto bhavatīti cet maivam /	They convey the meaning of a word at first. Afterwards they convey the mean- ing of a sentence. Now, the upholders of the hypothesis under discussion may contend that the solution, offered by the critics, amounts to this that the meanings of words point to the mea- ning of a sentence.
padārtho hi nāma prameyam eva /	The meaning of a word is an object of knowledge.
na te pramāṇavarge nipatanti /	It cannot be included in the source of knowledge.

Hence, the relation between an indicator and the indicated, which holds between smoke, accompanied by the relation of universal concomitance, and fire and between a lamp, unaccompanied by the relation of universal concomitance and the colour, does not obtain be- tween the meaning of a word and that of a sentence.
kathaṃ bhavān svabhāvahetuvādino bauddhasya śiṣya iva nirvṛttaḥ //	If they contend that nature divides them into such two halves then they behave like the disciples of the Buddhists who hold that one and the same phenomenon by its very intrinsic nature plays the part of a mark and the object marked.826 Now, the defenders of the hypothesis in question may con- tend thus Words denote universals.
nanu sāmānye hi padaṃ vartate viśeṣe ca vākyam /	A sentence points to a particular. There is a great gulf fixed between a particular and a universal.
anyac ca sāmānyam anye ca viśeṣāḥ /	As there is a real difference between an illuminator and the illumined, so a universal differs from a particular.
tad uktam [sāmānyāny anyathāsiddheḥ viśeṣaṃ gamayanti hi] iti vyatireka eva pratyāyyapratyāyakayoḥ /	The implication of the above contention is this that their suggestion is logically sound and they do not follow the foot-steps of the Buddhists in order to defend the above hypothesis.
ucyate /	Let us examine the above solution.
bāḍham asty ayam iyān vyatirekaḥ /	But we also submit the following by way of criticism in this connection.
kin tu viratavyāpāre cakṣuṣīva śabde dhūmādivat prameyāt padārthāt agner iva vākyārthasyāvagamo nāsti /	If words which consti- tute a sentence cease to function then no meaning is conveyed by them. Just as the eyes do not reveal an object when they cease to function.
na hi padārthāḥ prameyībhūya dhūmavat punaḥ pramāṇībhavitum arhanti / kin tu padāny eva tatpratipādanadvāreṇa vākyārthapratipattau paryavasyanti /	Hence, the suggestion of the defenders, "As smoke and such other objects which are knowable objects point to fire and other objects so the meanings of words which are knowable objects point to the meaning of a sentence" does not hold good. Words, conveying their own meaning, are capable of communicating the meaning of a sentence.
katham ātmīyam eva granthaṃ nāvabudhyante bhavantaḥ /	Why do you not follow the text of your own school.
[vākyārthapratyaye teṣāṃ pravṛttau nāntarīyakam /	The sense of this statement is that words, having communicated their own meaning, convey the sense of a sentence.
avāntaravyāpāro hi na kārakasya pradhāne vyāpāre kārakatāṃ vyāhanti /	The secondary operation of a cause does not interfere with its main operation.
padānāṃ hi dvayī śaktiḥ abhidhātrī tātparyaśaktiś ca / tatra abhidhātrī śaktir eṣāṃ padārtheṣūpayuktā /	Words have two kinds of power to convey their meaning viz., (1) the power to convey the primary (etymological) meaning and (2) the power to express the inner meaning.
tātparyaśaktiś ca vākyārthe paryavasyatīti //	Words exhaust their first type of power to communi- cate their own meaning.
bhāṣyakāro 'pi [padāni hi svaṃ svam artham abhidhāya nivṛttavyāpārāṇi] iti vadan abhidhāvyāpāra eva śakteḥ viratim āha na tātparyaśakteḥ /	The second type of power is fully app- lied to express the meaning of a sentence.Meanings of Words, their scope Though words have fulfilled their mission, to some extent, communicating their own meaning yet they have not as yet completed their main task for which they have assembled.
abhidhāya nivṛttavyāpārāṇi padāni yadarthaparāṇi tatrānivṛttavyāpārāṇy eva evaṃ hi śābdatā vākyārthapratyayasya na hāsyate / sarvātmanā tu viratavyāpāre śabde sāvaśyaṃ hīyate / śabdāvagatimūlatvāt tu śābdatve śrautratvam api syāt śrotrasya pāraṃparyeṇa tanmūlatvāt /	If words do not operate at all in order to convey the meaning of a sentence then the know- ledge of such meaning does not surely come under the jurisdic- tion of verbal knowledge. If it is admitted that the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence is verbal because of its causal connection with the knowledge of words then one should also hold that it is also a piece of auditory sense-perception since it is indirectly connected with the auditory sense-organ.
śabde ca viratavyāpāre katamat tatpramāṇam yasya vākyārthapratītiḥ phalam iti vidmaḥ //	If they hold that the meaning of a sentence is communicated when words have completely ceased to operate then we fail to understand which kind of proof will effectuate the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence.
na pratyakṣam atīndriyatvād vākyārthasya / nānumānam [na cānumānam eṣā dhīḥ] ityādinā granthavistareṇa svayam eva nirastatvāt /	The knowledge of the meaning of a sentence is not inferen- tial since the propounders of the said hypothesis themselves have said that it is not an inference and elaborately refuted the affirmative view.
na śabda nivṛttavyāpāratvāt //	Again, this knowledge is not verbal since words have completely ceased to operate.
[sāmānyāny anyathāsiddheḥ viśeṣaṃ gamayanti hi] iti nyāyāt / arthāpattir iti cet kim idānīṃ arthāpattigamyo dharmaḥ /	The drift of this line of argument is that the meaning of a sentence is known through presumption. Do the upholders of the said hypothesis say it in the affirmative? If they say so then the very meaning looks like dharma which is revealed only through presumption.
na caitad yuktaṃ iṣṭaṃ vā /	Such a conclusion is nei- ther sound nor acceptable to you.
tad idaṃ saptamaṃ pramāṇam avatarati pārārthyaṃ nāma /	Thus, the meaning of a word turns out to be the seventh source of true knowledge.
etac cāpi neṣṭam /	Such a conclusion is not acceptable to you.
ato na padārthanimittakaḥ vākyārthapratyayaḥ //	Therefore the meanings of words do not determine the knowledge of the meaning of a sentence.

Something may be stated on this point. The meaning of a sentence is not 827828 an independant reality. It is nothing but the meanings of words in their relational character. The meaning of a sentence is possi- ble only when the meanings of words constitute it.
mānase cāpacāre sati padānāṃ api grahaṇaṃ nāsty eva yataḥ kṣaṇāntare samāhitacetāḥ sa vakti [nāham etad aśrauṣam anyatra me mano 'bhūt punar brūhi] iti / itarathā hi padāni smṛtvā tadartham evāvagacchet na punaḥ pṛcchet /	When a man remains inattentive he does not listen to words since he, being attentive, says shortly after. "I have not heard your words as my mind was otherwise engaged. Please repeat them." If words had not conveyed sense then he would have made out the meaning of words, having recollected the words but would not have made a request to repeat them for his hearing.
tasmāt padānāṃ grahaṇam eva tatra vākyārthāvagame nimittam //	Therefore, the knowledge of the meanings of words lies at the root of that of the meaning of a sentence.
yad api [paśyataḥ śvetam ārūpaṃ] iti tad api na kiṃcit / kiṃ pratyakṣeṇa śuklo gauḥ gacchat dṛśyate /	Do we not see a white cow move? Does no sentence convey the sense that a white cow moves. When we perceive her to move the resulting judgment that a white cow moves is a percept.
na śuklo gauḥ gacchatīti vākyasyārtho na bhavati /	The judgment in question is not the mean- ing of the sentence that a white cow moves.
evaṃ [śveto 'śvo dhāvati] ity ānumāniko 'yaṃ pratyayaḥ parvate 'gnir itivat /	The judgment that white horse is running is deducive in its character just like the syllogism that there is fire on the hill.
vākyaśravaṇāt tu vinā na vākyārtho bhavitum arhatīty alaṃ prasaṅgena //	If a judgment flashes in our mind but a sentence is not heard before then we cannot say that the said judgment is the meaning of a sentence.
tasmāt padārthajanyā na bhavati vākyārthabuddhir iti siddham / anuparatavyāpārāt vākyād eveyam udbhavati // āha kayā punaḥ kalpanāyā padavākyabhāvam upagatā varṇāḥ padārthavākyārthapratītim ādadhyur iti //	The concluding Portion of the above Topic is that a Sentence Conveys its own Aleaning By means of an imaginative synthesis letters are combined into words and a sentence. Thus letters, having assumed the forms of words and a sentence, convey the meaning of words and a sentence. Therefore, the knowledge of the meaning of aA Sentence to convey its own meaning sentence is not produced by the meaning of words.
tatra ācāryās tāvad imāṃ kalpanām adīdṛśan /	Such know- ledge owes its existence to a sentence which has not ceased to operate.
prathamaṃ varṇajñānaṃ tataḥ saṃskāraḥ /	At the out-set the initial letter is pre- sented to our consciousness.
tato dvitīyavarṇajñānaṃ tena prathamavarṇajñānajanitena ca saṃskārena paṭutarasaṃskāraḥ /	Then the second letter is grasped. The awareness of the second letter coupled with the impression of the first letter produces a more effective second impression.
tataḥ tṛtīyavarṇajñānaṃ tena prāktanena saṃskāreṇa paṭutaraḥ saṃskāraḥ /	Afterwards the third letter flashes on the mind. The awareness of the third letter accompanied by the two previous impressions produces a more powerful impression of the third letter.
evaṃ yāvad antyavarṇajñānam /	As long as the last component letter of a word is not cognised, the inner process of framing impression will go on in this way.
antyavarṇānantaraṃ tu tataḥ saṃskārāt sakalapūrvavarṇaviṣayam ekasmaraṇam /	When the last letter is apprehended a strong impression is generated. An act of recollection recalls all antecedent letters in memory.
tenāntyavarṇajñānasya vinaśyattā /	The apprehension of the last letter passes away at the third moment of duration of the said recollection.
vinaśyadavasthagrahaṇasmaraṇaviṣayīkṛto varṇasamūhaḥ padam iti jñāyate //	The last letter which is an object of apprehension is on the verge of destruction and the group of letters which are recalled in memory constituted a word.
tataḥ padajñānāt saṃskāraḥ /	Then the knowledge of the initial word produces an impression.
tataḥ tathaiva varṇakrameṇa dvitīyapadajñānam / tena prathapadajñānajanmanā ca saṃskāreṇa paṭutarasaṃskāro janyate /	Afterwards in accordance with the procedure of letters the knowledge of the second word arises in the mind. The knowledge of the second word coupled with the impression of the first word produces a very strong impression of the second word.
punas tenaiva krameṇa tṛtīyapadajñānam / tena prāktanena ca saṃskāreṇa pīvarataraḥ saṃskāraḥ janyate /	Then, according to the order of apprehension, impression and recollection, the knowl- edge of the third word takes place.
evaṃ yāvad antyapadajñānaṃ antareṇa sthavīyasā saṃskāreṇa sarvapadaviṣayam ekasmaraṇam upajanyate / saṃskārasyaivaikatvāt so 'yaṃ smaraṇānubhavaviṣayīkṛtavarṇasamūha eva padam /	Thus, the modus operandi will continue unless and until the knowledge of the last letter flashes in our mind. The very powerful830 impression which comes into being immediately before the knowledge of the last word revives the memory of all antece- dent words since the impression which is made strong immedia- tely before the knowledge of the last word becomes exceptionally strong.
padasamūho vākyam ity ucyate /	The collection of words which consists of letters and one of which is known and the remaining ones are recalled in memory passes under the name of a sentence.
tato vākyārthapratipattiḥ /	A sentence, having thus come into being, communicates its own meaning.
saṃskārasya ca saṃskārāntarakaraṇakauśalam avaśyam eṣitavyam /	One must admit that an impression produces another impression and an impression has skill in producing such impression.
anyathā sarvatra kriyābhyāso 'narthakaḥ syād iti //	If one does not subscribe to this hypothesis then in all cases, the repetition of an act will become futile.
atra vadanti neyaṃ prakriyā sādhvī jñānayaugapadyaprasaṅgāt /	They hold that the said solution is not satisfactory since if it is admitted then the sim- ultaneity of the two acts of consciousness should be accepted.
tathā hi caramapadapratibhāsānantaraṃ yathā pūrvapadasmaraṇaṃ tathā tadaiva saṃketasmaraṇenāpi bhavitavyam /	As antecedent words are recalled in memory just after the presentation of the last word to our consciousness so the relation of denotation holding be- tween a word and its meaning will also be at that very point of time recalled in memory since the meaning of a word will not be cognised if the relation of denotation is not remem- bered.
anavagatapadārthasaṃbandhasya hi na vākyārthapratītiḥ /	And without the remembrance of the relation of deno- tation the meaning of a word is not presented to consciousness.

The inference of such an object is not preceded by the conscious process of recollecting the relation of universal concomitance. But one is compelled to admit that the relation of universal concomitance is somehow remembered.
saṃbandhānubhavasya ca pūrvavṛttatvenedanīṃ smaraṇamukhenaupakāritvāt /	As the apprehension of the relation of denotation has happened before so the recollection of the said relation renders the useful service.
tasmād antyapadajñānānantaraṃ pūrvapadasamayasmaraṇayoḥ yugapadutpādāt jñānayaugapadyam //	Therefore, the recollection of words antecedent to the last one and that of the relation of denotation simultaneously take place just after the presentation of the last word to consciousness.
atha samayasmaraṇānantaraṃ pūrvapadasmaraṇam upeyate tathāpi tatsmṛtikāle padārthajñānopajananāt punar api jñānayaugapadyam /	If this is their contention then they will admit that at the time of the recollection of the antecedent words the mean- ing of words flashes in their mind. Thus, the simultaneity of the two acts of consciousness takes place in another form.

If the auditory organ once suspends its function then it does not resume its work. At least we have no knowledge of such working of the auditory sensc- organ. Nobody has direct knowledge of an external object in and through mere introspection. The inner organ has no direct access to an external object.
antyapadajñānasya hi saṅketasmṛtivelāyāṃ vinaśyattā padārthajñānavelāyāṃ vināśa eva yataḥ // brūyāt asaṃvedyamānam api tadānīm antyapadam asty eveti svasti tarhi nyāyavistarāya //	When it receives the aid of an external organ it is able to be aware of an external object. If the consciousness of the last word re-appears anyhow then the charge of the simultaneity of the two acts of consciousness stands irrefutable.
śrotrasya viramyavyāpārāsaṃvedanāt /	Such unintelligible sounds, being remembered, convey no sense.

Now, if you (the upholder of the thesis under criti- cism) hold that those words along with their meanings are recalled in our mind then in every case the simultaneity of the two different acts of consciousness will be inevitable since an act of consciousness will surely be crossed by an act of remem- brance, i.e., the remembrance of the relation of denotation.
na hi tathāvidhapadasmaraṇam arthapratyāyanāṅgam //	Therefore, the hypothesis of this type is highly inconsistent.

tadabhāvāc ca nātra jñānayaugapadyādicodyāvasaraḥ samasti /	Then following the order of events stated above, the consciousness of the second word comes into being.
yathopadarśitāntyapadajñānam eva ca vākyārthajñānam iti na tasya caritārthatvam anyatra ity evaṃ vākyād eva vākyārthapratyayaḥ setsyati na padarthebhya iti //	Then, the relation of denotation holding between the second word and its meaning is recalled in our memory. The consciousness of the second word is on the eve of destruction at that time.
iyam api na niravadyā kalpanety apare prathamapadoparāgapūrvakadvitīyapadajñānopajananānupapatteḥ / prathamapadajñānānantaraṃ hi saṃbandhasmaraṇam /	At this stage of its life the immediate antecedent consciousness of a word, in co-operation with the remembrance of the relation of denotation, produces the knowledge of the meaning of the second word.
tenaiva tasya vinaśyattā /	The meaning flashes in our mind as determined by its own denotative word.
padārthapratipattikāle ca padajñānaṃ vinaṣṭam eva /	The knowledge of the meaning of the second word, in co- operation with the impression of the knowledge of the meaning of the first word, makes a stronger impression.
vinaśyadavasthā buddhiḥ buddhyantaravirodhinīti sāmānyena śravaṇāt //	A few letters which consecutively follow one another are combined into a word.
etad ayuktam viśeṣe pramāṇābhāvāt //	Thus, the third word is revived.

Again, the consciousness of the third word on the verge of its destruction, assisted by the memory of the relation of denotation, produces the knowledge of the mean- ing of the third word as determined by the third word. This know- ledge in co-operation of its antecedent impression, strengthens the existing impression.
api ca padajñānam upajāyamānaṃ varṇakrameṇa jāyate na sahasaiva niraṃśapadavādasya vyudastatvāt /	Thus, the process of the growth of know- ledge goes on unless and until the last word of the sentence is presented to our consciousness and its meaning is communicated.

Afterwards, the antecedent strong impression produces a judg- ment of memory which refers to all meanings as determined by834 Nyāyamanjari the past words.
tatra [re kandalaka kalpitaparyāṇaṃ turagam ānaya] iti vākyārthāvagamo bhavati /	The said judgment of memory and the judg- ment which refers to the meaning of the last word point to all words as determinant of their contents.
padānurāgasya tatrāsaṃbhavāt /	The collection of words, thus revealed, constitutes a sentence.
pūrvapadasmaraṇasya cānabhyupagamāt //	The meanings which are presented to our consciousness as denoted by these words cons- titute the meaning of the sentence in question.

The Review of the Alternative Hypothesis The alternative hypothesis does not stand to reasons.

The word in question is undoubtedly one of the conditions of the knowledge of the said meaning.
na hīyaṃ kavibhiḥ pūrvaiḥ adṛṣṭā sūkṣmadarśibhiḥ /	There is no divergence of opinion regarding the view in question.
na dohadaḥ paryanuyogabhūmiḥ paropadeśāc ca na tasya śāntiḥ // rājā tu gahvare 'smin aśabdake bandhane vinihito 'ham /	If the word is cognised, no body can deny existence to it. The word cannot cognise itself. It must be an object of some kind of cognition.
tathāpi vaktavyaṃ kathaṃ varṇebhyo vākyārthapratītir iti / ucyate cirātikrāntatvaṃ acirātikrāntatvaṃ vā na smṛtikāraṇam /	Let us now define the exact nature of this cognition. What is its cause? The cognition in question does not owe its existence to the auditory sense-organ. The first apprehension of the last word is perceptual.
saṃskārakaraṇakaṃ hi smaraṇaṃ bhavati /	The perception in question is auditory.
antyapadasya cānubhūyamānatvopagame jñānayaugapadyādipramādaprasaṅga iti varam antyapadam api smaryamāṇam astu / smṛtiārūḍhāny eva sarvapadāni vākyārtham avagamayiṣyanti // tatra ceyaṃ kalpanā /	As it has been inactive so it cannot de novo produce that cognition which points to a word as a determinant of some meaning. We cannot directly introspect an external object with the help of our inner organ. If an external object had been directly introspected then all the words first, second and so on would have been thus introspected.
varṇakrameṇa tāvat prathamapadajñānam /	At first the first word is cognised.
tataḥ saṅketasmaraṇaṃ saṃskāraś ca yugapad bhavataḥ /	Then the relation of denot- ation holding between it and its meaning is recalled in mind.
jñānayor hi yaugapadyaṃ śāstre pratisiddhaṃ na saṃskārayoḥ /	The knowledge of the meaning acts as a destructive agent of the cognition of the first word.
tataḥ padārthajñānam /	Thus the cognition of the second word comes into being.
punar varṇakrameṇa dvitīyapadajñānam /	Then the knowledge of the meaning of the second word follows in its wake.
tataḥ saṅketasmaraṇam /	Let us now see the result of the act of remembrance.
pūrvasaṃskārasahitena ca tena paṭutaraḥ saṃskāraḥ /	When the mean- ing of the first word is conveyed to us the cognition of the first word has passed away.

But it is an ideal construction of a series of consecutive letters since the hypothesis that a word consists of no parts has been refuted. We should also remember in this connection that two or three, or three or four, or five or six letters constitute a word, these letters are consecutively presented to our cons- ciousness, and the consciousness of each letter comes into being and passes away in a consecutive order. All the letters which constitute a word are never simultaneously presented to our consciousness. The cognition of the last word turns up in this way.
tatraikasyāṃ smṛtāv upārūḍhaḥ padasamūho vākyaṃ itarasyām upārūḍhaḥ padārthasamūho vākyārthaḥ //	Having finished it he says "On my horse". Another call of business interferes with his order. He pays his attention to it. Having completed it, he says again "Put harness".

yatra hy anyathāsaṃbandhagrahaṇaṃ anyathā ca pratipattiḥ tatrāyaṃ doṣaḥ /	The other assemblage of meanings which are recalled constitutes the meaning of a sentence. Now, a fresh objection arises.
yathā dhūme gṛhītasaṃbandhe nīhārād dahanānumitau /	Just as if we know that smoke is the right probans of fire i.e., the rela- tion of universal concomitance holds between smoke and fire but infer fire, seeing mist then our knowledge is wrong.
iha tu kramavartināṃ varṇānāṃ anyathā pratipattyasaṃbhavāt yathaiva vyutpattiḥ tathaiva pratītir iti na kiṃcid avadyam / aciranirvṛttānubhavasamanantarabhāvinī ca smṛtir anubhavāyate //	But in the present case the consecutive letters have been recalled in that very order of succession in which they have been presented to our consciousness at the time when the relation of denotation holding between the word, constituted by these letters, and its meaning has been taught. So, the hypothesis suggested by us, suffers from no defects.
atha vā kṛtaṃ smaraṇakalpanayā /	There is no need of entertaining the suggestion of judgments of memory.
antyapadārthajñānānantaraṃ sakalapadapadārthaviṣayo mānaso 'nuvyavasāyaḥ śatādipratyayasthānīyā bhaviṣyati /	When the meaning of the last word is known to us a judgment of introspection will arise. It will refer to all words and their meanings. It will resemble the referential knowledge of the number a hundred' etc.
tadupārūḍhāni padāni vākyaṃ tadupārūḍhaś ca padārtho vākyārthaḥ /	Words which are introspected constitute a sentence. Their meanings which are introspected constitute the meaning of a sentence.
tathāvidhaś ca mānaso 'nuvyavasāyaḥ sakalalokasākṣikatvād apratyākhyeyaḥ /	Such an introspection cannot be disapproved since every body bears witness to it.

What is the motive of framing such a suggestion? If the meaning of the last word is known to us then all our task has been completed. What remains to be done? Say what will be referred to by a judgment of memory or by that of intro- spection.
kathaṃ na kariṣyate ekākāro hi vākyavākyārthapratyayaḥ pratyātmavedanīyo na śakyate 'pahnotum /	Such an argument does not carry conviction since no body can dare deny that the meaning of a sentence which is experienced by every body is presented as an integrate whole.

An introduction to the hypothesis of mutual relations Let not a sphoţa which stands for a word or a sphota which stands for a sentence convey a sense.
padaṃ varṇasamūho 'stu vākyaṃ ca padasaṃhatiḥ // bhavantu bhavadākhyātāḥ padavākyādikalpanāḥ /	Let not a sentence or the meaning of a sentence be partless. Let the hypothesis of words or sentences as suggested by you be approved.
padārthānāṃ tu saṃsarge mārgaḥ ka iti kathyatām //	But say how are the meanings of words mutually related.
asaṃsṛṣṭā hi [gaur aśvaḥ puruṣo hastī] iti padārthāḥ na vākyārthabhāvam adhirohanti /	The meanings of words such as a cow, a horse, a man and an elephant remaining unrelated do not constitute the meaning of a sentence.
antyapadārthajñānānantarabhāvināṃ hi smaraṇena anuvyavasāyena vā viṣayīkriyamāṇās tu yathāvagatā eva viṣayīkriyante /	A judgment of memory or of introspection which closely follows the knowledge of the meaning of the last word only refers to the meanings of words as cognised before.
saṃsargāvagamas tu kutastya iti cintyam /	Now, we should discuss how the knowledge of their mutual relation comes up.

anye tu manyante śuddhānām eva padārthānāṃ padair abhidhānam /	Others hold that words denote their meanings as mutually unrelated.
te tu tathā 'bhihitāḥ santaḥ parasparam ākāṅkṣāsannidhiyogyatvaparyālocanayā saṃsargam adhigamayantīti //	They, being thus denoted, point to their mutual relation when they are judged from the stand-points of reciprocal reference, material non-contradiction and proximity.
tatredaṃ vicāryam vyutpattir balīyasī na hi śabdo vyutpattinirapekṣo 'rtham avagamayanti /	Instruction plays the very im- portant part to reveal the meaning of a word or of a sentence since a word or a sentence remains ever unintelligible if the meaning of a word or of a sentence is not taught.
vyutpattiś ca kiṃ vākyasya vākyārthe padasya vā padārthe iti // yadi vākyasya vākyārthe vyutpattiḥ tadā 'nvitābhidhānam padasya padārthe vyutpattau abhihitānvaya iti //	Are we ini- tiated into the meaning of a sentence or into that of a word ? Are we taught that this sentence conveys this meaning or that this word conveys this meaning? If we hold that we are initiat- ed into the meaning of a sentence then we advocate the doctrine of Anvita-abhidhána.
abhihitānvaya iti / padārthapratipattipūrvakatvād vākyārthapratipatteḥ /	If we hold that we are initiated into the meaning of a word then we subscribe to the doctrine of Abhihita-anvaya.843 Doctrine of Abhihita-anvaya The doctrine of abhihita-anvaya Now, a question arises viz., "which one (of the above two- hypotheses) is to be accepted ?" Our simple answer is that the hypothesis of Abhihita-anvaya should be approved since the ascertainment of the meaning of a sentence presupposes the determination of the meanings of its constituent words.
na hy anavagatapadārthasya vākyārthasaṃpratyayo dṛśyate padārthavibhāgaś ca gamyate asya padasya jātir arthaḥ asya dravyaṃ asya guṇaḥ asya kriyeti /	If one is not acquainted with the meanings of words, he cannot make out the meaning of a sentence. The meanings of words are classed under different heads. We say "This word denotes a universal, this word means a substance, this word stands for an attribute and this word conveys an action.
sa caivam avakalpate yadi tāvat so 'rthaḥ padair abhidhīyate /	This statement becomes relevant if words express the above meanings which remain at first unrelated.
padāntarārthoparakte tu tasminn abhidhīyamāne tadartheyattaiva nāvadhāryate kadambākārārthapratīteḥ //	Such a contention does not hold water since there is no occasion for the application of the joint method of agreement and difference to individualise the meaning of a word.

But if words are isolated from a sentence, they express such meanings as are in themselves, i.e., as stand unrelated. If all words which are the source of meanings assemble together then all the meanings of words are also presented to our conscious- ness in their mutual relation. In that case, it is very difficult to single out the meaning of a word.
tataś ca padārthānām anapekṣaṇe gāmānayeti vākyāt aśvānayananiyogaḥ pratīyet gāṃ badhāneti vākyād aśvabandhnaniyogaḥ pratiyeta / apekṣyate tu padānām arthaḥ /	Now, if a sentence isNyayamanjari independant of the meanings of words then the sentence "Bring a cow" may be taken as the mandate "Tie down a horse." Thus we see that real meanings of words are required for the understanding of a sentence.
so 'pekṣyamāṇaḥ iyān iti niyato 'vadhāritavyaḥ /	If they are so required then they should be grasped in their well-defined character.
tasmāt padapadārthayor autpattikaḥ saṃbandha iṣyate //	Hence, one is compelled to admit that the relation which holds between a word and its meaning is natural.

sā cānattyāt durupapādeti śabdavyavahārocchedaḥ syāt /	As sentences are infinite in number so it is impossible to obtain mastery over language.
dṛśyate ca padārthavidām abhinavakaviślokād api vākyārthapratītiḥ /	It is also noticed that a person who is conversant with word-meanings makes out the sense even of a new poem, composed by a poet.

Therefore, the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhâna is not sound. 844 Reasons which invalidate the rival hypothesis of anvita-abhi- dhāna are as follows.
gaur ity ukte sarvaguṇakriyā 'vagamāt na jñāyate kim upādīyatām iti /	If we say "A cow" then all predicable attributes and actions flash in our mind. But we cannot select the acceptable meaning.
sarvāvagamo hy anavagamanirviśeṣa eva vyavahārānupapatteḥ /	To know all things at a time is in a sense to remain ignorant since a listener can take no action upon a word.
na hi rasavidāṃ pūrṇo 'py abdhiḥ meror atiricyate salilakāryānirvṛtteḥ /	To a man of taste an ocean, full of water, does not appear to be distinct from a desert since saline water does not serve the purpose of pureDoctrine of Abhihita-anvaya water.
niyataguṇakriyānuraktasvārthapratipādane tu gośabdasya na hetum utpaśyāmaḥ //	But we see no reason why the word 'cow' will convey its own meaning as qualified by the exact attribute or action which will suit the purpose of the listener.
padāntarasannidhānaṃ niyamahetur iti cet kiṃ svarūpamātreṇa artha pratipādanena vā svarūpamātreṇa japamantrapadānām iva sannidhānaṃ bhavad api asannidhānān na viśiṣyate anuhīnasaṃbandhasya tat kṛtopakārādarśanāt //	Does the said association of words help to convey the above meaning? Or, does the word itself communicate its own meaning? If you insist on the truth of your suggestion then we say in reply that the association of other words is not as significant as that of some words in a mantra which is muttered. It makes no difference whether these words are present or absent since a word serves no useful purpose if we do not know that it denotes such-and-such meaning.
arthapratipādanena tu padāntaraṃ yadi niyamahetuḥ so 'yam abhihitānām arthānām anvaya ukto bhavati /	Now, if you hold that other words help to determine the meaning of the said word by conveying their own meanings then you subscribe to the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya.
tasmāt sa eva śroyān padebhyaḥ pratipannā niṣkṛṣṭās tāvad arthā ākāṃkṣāsannidhiyogyatvavaśena parasparam abhisaṃbadhyante /	Therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya is better. The meanings which are conveyed by words become related to one another from the stand-points of mutual re- quirement, recíprocal proximity, and absence of contradiction.
yo yenākāṅkṣitaḥ yaś ca sannihitaḥ yaś ca saṃbaddhuṃ yogyaḥ sa tena saṃbadhyate nāto 'paraḥ //	The meaning of a word which is required by that of another word is related to that.
ata eva [aṅgulyagre hastiyūthaśatam āste] iti nāsti saṃbandhaḥ yogyatvābhāvāt /	For this reason, the sentence, "A hundred herds of elephants stand on the finger- end" has the meanings of its words mutually unrelated since these meanings are unfit to be related.
anvitābhidhāvādināṃ tu ananvitasyānabhidhānāt tatrāpy anvayaḥ prāpnoti /	But if we subscribe to the hypothesis of anvita- abhidhāna then the said sentence should convey a sense since according to the above hypothesis a sentence does never express a meaning which is unrelated.
sa ca nāsti /	But, in reality, the said sentence communicates no meaning.
tasmāt abhihitānām eva padārthānām anvaya iti yuktam /	Hence, it is reasonable to hold that the meanings of words which are conveyed enter into relation- 845Nyayamanjari ship.
tad uktaṃ [padāni hi svaṃ svam artham abhidhāya nivṛttavyāpārāṇi / athedānīm arthāḥ avagatā vākyārthaṃ saṃpādayanti] iti //	Some scholars have also said to this effect that words, having conveyed their own meanings, complete their task and afterwards these meanings, being grasped, point to the meaning of a sentence.
evaṃ prāpte abhidhīyate na vyutpattinirapekṣo dīpa iva śabdo 'rtham avagamayati /	They point out that a word does not illuminate an object just like a lamp since a listener must be initiated into the meaning of a word in order to understand it.

vṛddhānāṃ ca vyavahāro vākyena na padena kevalapadasyāprayogāt //	The sentences are never replaced by words. The reason is that mere words are never used to ex- press one's ideas.
padaṃ prayujyate yat tat vākyam evoditaṃ bhavet //	A word is employed to communicate this new idea. This word should be considered as a sentence.
vaktā vākyaṃ prayuṅkte ca saṃsṛṣṭārthavivakṣayā /	A speaker employs a sentence in order to communicate a system of ideas in which all ideas are mutually connected.

seyaṃ vākyasya vākyārthe vyutpattiḥ // vākyaṃ ca kim ucyate saṃhatyārtham abhidadhanti padāni vākyam iti vākyavidaḥ /	This is what is called the communication of the meaning of a sentence. Do you say what is a sentence? Words which con- jointly express a unity of meanings are called a sentence.
tatrāyam padasamūha evārtho bhavati /	If we subscribe to this view then a collection of words conveys a unity of meanings.
evaṃ na saṃhatyārtham abhidadhyuḥ padāni yady ekaikasya padasya sarvatra vyāpāraḥ /	If only a single word had expressed such a unity of meanings then words could not conjointly convey a complex whole of meaning.

tad idam anvitābhidhānam /	This is what is called anvita-abhidhāna (an expression of mutually related meanings).
anyānanvitaniṣkṛṣṭasvārthaparyavasāyitve hi sati na sarveṣāṃ vākyarthe vyāpāras syāt //	If a word could express a self-complete meaning which is in no way connected with the meanings of other words817 Hypothesis of Abhikita-anvaya Refuted then all words would have no usefulness to convey the mean- ing of a sentence.

Now, you admit that a single word cannot convey a complete meaning. Such an admission is contrary to the corollary of your own hypothesis.
na tarhy ekaṃ kṛtsnakārīti cet maivam ekaikasya kṛtsnaphalaparyantavyāpārapatitatvāt ekaikasmin sati kṛtsnaphalaparyanto vyāpāro nirvartate ekaikena vinā na nirvartata ity evam ekaikaṃ kṛtsnakāri bhavati //	Each word falls within those the operation of which yields a complete result. If such a single word is present then an operation which brings about a complete result takes place. Again, such an operation does not take place if such a single word is not present. Thus we say that a single word produces a complete result.
nanu evaṃ tarhi samudāya eva kartā bhavatu kiṃ samudāyibhiḥ tataś ca tad evāyātaṃ niravayavau vākyavākyārthāv iti naitad yuktam saṅghātakāryavat svakāryasyāpi darśanāt //	Now, if the above objection goes to such a length then we say "Let the collection of words convey the requisite meaning." We also feel no necessity of holding that individual words which constitute the said collection convey the meaning in question. The hypothesis, thus revised, amounts to this that a sentence and its meaning admit of no parts.
artha kiṃ saṅghātakāryam kiṃ ca tat svakāryam vākyārthapratipattiḥ saṅghātakāryam / svakāryaṃ tu padārthapratipattiḥ /	What is the working of a collection? And what is the work- ing of an individual? The communication of the meaning of a sentence is what a collection does-whereas the exact express- ion of the meaning of a word is the work of an individual word.
yathā pākaḥ saṅghātakāryam / svakāryaṃ jvalanabharaṇādi kāṣṭhasthālyā dīnām //	viz., the act of cooking whereas individual conditions perform separate acts, e.g., faggots burn and a pot holds articles to be cooked.
nanu yadi padānāṃ padārthapratipādanam svakāryam śuddhās tarhi padasyārthaḥ na śuddhaḥ padārthaḥ /	If a word has a distinct operation of expressing its own meaning then it should be admitted that the meaning of a word keeps itself aloof from those of other words.
saṅghātakāryam akurvatāṃ śuddhānāṃ padānām adṛṣṭaṣvāt /	The reason is this that a word is employed to serve the purpose of a collection of words.
na hy eṣāṃ svakārye saṅghātakārye ca pṛthak prayogo 'sti sarvathā saṅghātakārya eva prayogāt /	Though a word is included in a collection of words yet it is not a fact that the specific operation of a word is not grasped.
ata eva na niravayavaṃ vākyam iṣyate svakāryapratyabhijñānāt //	Hence, we do not share the view that a sentence is partless since the specific contribution of each word comprised within an assemblage of words is known to us.
saṃhatās te saṃghātakāryaṃ kurvanto dṛśyante na saṃghāta eva saṃhateṣv api kurvatsu svakāryaṃ pṛthak pṛthag upalabhyate /	It is also observed that words which fall within a collection of words conjointly perform the work of the collection. The said collection is not noticed to maintain itself as distinct from the constituent words themselves.
yathā śakaṭāṃgāṇāṃ ayaṃ maśo 'nena kṛtaḥ ayam aneneti na pṛthak pṛthak prayujyamānāni śakaṭāṃgāni manāg api śakaṭakāryaṃ kuvantīty evaṃ na kevalaṃ padaṃ prayujyate prayuktam api vā na tatkāryāṅgam /	Let us cite an example to elucidate our point. A carriage consists of several parts. We do not single out each part and say that this part, being made up of this stuff and that part, being made up of that stuff, separately perform the action of a carriage. Similarly, a single word is never employed. Even if it is employed, it does not point to the meaning of a sentence.
padāntareṇa tu saha vyāpārāt tadanvitārthaṃ kāryaṃ eva padam iti yuktam / tad idam uktaṃ [saṃhatyārtham abhidadhanti padāni vakyam ekārthaḥ padasamūho vākyam] iti //	But a word, being combined with other words, engages itself to convey the meaning of a sentence. So, it is reasonable to think that the above word throws light on the hypothesis of a complex whole of meanings. Hence, we have stated that words conjointly convey their meaning.
tad evam avayavakāryopalambhāt na vaiyākaraṇavan nimittāny api nihnumahe kṛtsnaphalasiddhyavadhi vyāpāraparinścayāc ca nānyamīmāṃsakavat śuddha padārthābhidhānam upagacchāmaha iti //	For this reason as we know the contribution of each part so we agree with the grammarians in not denying etymological meanings to words. Again, as we definitely know that each word goes on with its operation unless and until the final goal is reached so we agree to differ from other Mimamsakas in the point that a word denotes its mean- ing as qualified by those of other words.
yat punar abhyadhayi prativakyaṃ vyutpattir apekṣaṇīyā anyathā navakaviślokād arthaḥ padārhtavido na pratīyeteti tad idaṃ vyutpattyanabhijñasya codyam na hy evaṃ vyutpattiḥ [gośabdasya śuklānvito 'rthaḥ] iti /	An answer to the charges levelled Against the Hypothesis of Anvita- Abhidhāna Our objectors have pointed out that if one subscribes to the hypothesis of anvita-ahhidhâna then he should admit that the meaning of each sentence is to be learnt, otherwise, a person who knows only the meanings of words cannot make out the PHypothesis of Anvita-Abhidhana meaning of a verse composed by a modern poct.
sa hi vyabhicarati kṛṣṇānvitasya darśanāt /	It also refers to a black cow as its meaning.
nāpi sarvānvitas tadarthaḥ ānantyena duravagamāt /	One cannot also hold that the word 'a cow' denotes cows having all sorts of attributes since objects, thus denoted, are infinite in number and difficult to comprehend.
kin tv ākāṅkṣitayogyasannihitārthānurakto 'syārtha iti //	The ascertainment of the right meaning is arrived at by means of the joint method of agreement and difference.
etāṃ ca vyutpattiṃ vākyānyāvāpodvāpābhyāṃ racanāvaicitryabhāṃji saṃjanayanti /	This reason behind the above conclusion is this that an experienced man who orders and an experienc- ed man who is ordered do never employ a mere word.
padārthaparyantāpi bhavantī vyutpattiḥ īdṛśī dṛśyate na śuddhapadārthaviṣayā padena vyavahārābhāvād ity uktam /	Though we subscribe to the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhäna yet it is not a truism that the exact meaning of a word is not determined.
tathāpi na na jñāyate iyān padasyārtha iti śakaṭāṅgavad āvāpodvāpābhyāṃ tatkāryabhedasya darśitatvāt //	With the illustrat- ion of the different functions of various parts of a carriage we have shown the different workings of various words in a sentence by means of the joint method of agreement and difference.
tad itthaṃ na prativākyaṃ vyutpattir apekṣyate /	Thus we see that the meaning of a sentence does not necessarily constitute an indivisible unit.
sannihitayogyākāṅkṣitārthoparaktasvārthābhidhāyitvena hi kva cid gṛhītasaṃbandhaḥ sarvatra gṛhīto bhavati /	With the help of accessory conditions such as requirement, fitness of relation and proximity we have sometimes determined the meaning of a sentence together with those of words.
tataś ca navakaviślokād apy arthapratipattir upapatsyate /	Hence, we shall be able to understand the meaning of a new poem, composed by a modern poet.
padapadārthayos tu na vyutpattiḥ upāyābhāvād ity uktam // yad api padānaroccāraṇam aphalam iti tad api parihṛtam padāntarasannidhāne hi sarvāṇi padani kṛtsnakārīṇi bhavanīty uktatvāt /	We have also stated before that if words denote merely isolated meanings then we shall have never an access to the meaning of a sentence since 849850 such meanings are not the means of the determination of the meaning of a sentence. Another objection to this hypothesis has been recorded to this effect that the utterance of other words is superfluous.
padāntarasannidhānena kriyata iti cet sarvakārakeṣv api tulyo 'yam anuyogaḥ /	The reason behind our answer has been stated thus-"when other words come in close proximity all words play their part full well.
saṃhatya tu sarvāṇi kārakāṇi kurvantīty ucyante /	But you admit that all conditions conjointly bring about an action. i.e., produce a result.
tathā padāny api arthābhidhānenāpi copakurvatsu padeṣu nābhihitānvayaḥ ananvite 'rthe vyutpattyabhāvāt /	Similar- ly, if all words co-operate to convey the meaning of a sentence, expressing their own meanings then the hypothesis of abhihita- nvaya (unrelated meanings) does not stand to reason since one is never initiated into the unrelated meaning of a word.
anupagame vā durupapādaḥ padārthānām anvayaḥ upāyābhāvāt //	Now, the objector may contend that unrelated meanings may relate themselves to one another with the help of accessory conditions such as requirement, fitness and proximity.
nanu ākāṃkṣāsannidhiyogyatvāny abhyupāya ity uktam na yuktam uktam /	Our reply to this contention is this that the said contention is not tenable.
kasyeyam ākāṅkṣā śabdasya arthasya pramātur vā śabdārthayos tāvadacetanatvāt nākāṅkṣāyogaḥ /	This require- ment belongs to whom? Does it belong to a word, or to its meaning, or to a knower? As a word and its meaning are unconscious so they have no requirement since requirement presupposes consciousness.
phalata iyaṃ tu tatra tatra vācoyuktiḥ [śabdaḥ śabdāntaram ākāṃksati artho 'rthāntaram] iti /	Hence, we simply display empty words when we say that a word requires another word and a meaning requires another meaning.
pramātuḥ punaḥ svatantrasyā kāṃkṣā na pramāṇam puruṣecchayā vastusthiter aghaṭamānatvāt /	But this requirement is not a source of valid knowledge since one cannot acquire the true knowledge of things by an act of will.

It is, thus, the source of the knowledge of mutual relation among things. If words are held851 Hypothesis of Anvita-abhidhana Concluded to be responsible for the knowledge of things then we are to admit that words have long-lasting operation like arrows since, if words pass away, then the mere desire of a person cannot manufacture the mutual relation of things, denoted by words.
aśābdatvaṃ ca vākyārthapratīter ittham āpatet / vyādhānam ayuktaṃ ca sākṣac chābdatvasaṃbhave // tasvād anvitābhidhāyīni padānīti sthitam //	If we are in a position to demonstrate that words directly convey the meaning of a sentence then it is unwise on our part to hold that words indirectly convey the meaning of a sentence. + The concluding portion of the hypothesis of Anvita-Abhidhāna In fine, we arrive at the conclusion that words convey relat- ional meanings since it is the only way of communicating relation.
eṣa eva hi saṃsargapraīteḥ panthāḥ vyatiṣaktārthabuddhyā hi vyatiṣaṅgo 'vagamyate /	As we know for certain mutually related meanings so it is understood that related meanings have assembled.
aparaṃ tu na saṃsargapratīter asti kāraṇam //	There is no other source of the knowledge of relation.
na khalv ānaya gāṃ śuklāṃ saṃsarga iti kathyate /	If one says 'Bring a white cow,' he does not necessarily refer to a relat- ion.
vyavahāre kva cid vṛdhaiḥ padaṃ saṃsargavācakam //	In some cases of usage the experienced persons make mention of words denoting relation.
prayujyamānam apy etat bāliśena hi kena cit / ananvitārtham eva syāt daśadāḍim avākyavat //	If such a person says 'There are ten pomegranates' the meaning of the word 'ten' is not related to we see that the that of the word 'pomegranates'.
tasmād anvitānām evābhidhānaṃ yuktam //	Thus hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna (related meanings) is reason- able.
āha āṅgulyagrādivākyeṣu kathaṃ tava samanvayaḥ ucyate uktānām api saṃsarge kathaṃ tava samanvayaḥ // āha nanv atra yogyatābhāvād asaṃsarga upeyate /	Now, the upholder tries to find out an answer to the problem "How do you explain the sentence that there are a hundred herds of elephants on the tip of a finger from the stand-point of anvita-abhidhāna ?' The defender puts the same question to his objector and says O upholder of the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya! how do you solve this very problem? As you hold that meanings, being expressed, enter into mutual relation so you just explain how the meanings of words contained in the sentence are related to one another after their expression.'852 Now, the upholder of the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya says in replies to the question, 'As the meanings of words of the sentence are not fit to be related, they are not mutually related.
ākāṅkṣāditrayādhīnaḥ saṃsargo hi mayeṣyate // ucyate mayā 'pi yogyāsannādisaṃsṛṣṭasvārthavācyatā /	What we intend to say is this that expressed meanings are mutually related only when the conditions of mutual relation, viz., requirement, fitness and proximity are satisfied.' The upholder of the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna (ex- pression of related meanings) says, "I have also held that words convey mutually related meanings provided that they satisfy the conditions of requirement, fitness and proximity.
āha anvitābhidhānavādī hi bhavān / tataś ca bhavato 'nabhidhānaṃ syad anvayāsaṃbhavād iha //	In other words, if the meanings of words cannot unite themselves with one another then a sentence which contains words having unrelated meanings clearly fails to communicate its meaning.
ahaṃ tv abhihitānvayavādī /	But I advocate the doctrine of abhihita-anvaya.
tena mama tv anabhihitatve 'pi nābhidhānaṃ virudhyate // ucyate kaṣṭaṃ mīmāṃsakenāpi bhavatā sūkṣmadarśinā / nādyāpi śabdavyāpāraparamārtho 'vadhāritaḥ // prakāśakatvaṃ śabdasya vyāpāro hi nisargataḥ /	Hence I hold that though the meanings of words in the above sentence stand unrelated yet the sentence conveys its meaning. Saying this I am not open to the charge of inconsistency.' The upholder of the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna retorts thus Though you are a judge, having keen insight yet you have not followed the process adopted by a word to convey its meaning.
puṃsas tu guṇadoṣābhyāṃ tasmin sadasadarthatā // kriyākārakasaṃsargabuddhir atrāpi śabdajā / tādṛśyevāyathārthā tu narabuddhipramādataḥ //	It is natural function of a word to convey its mean- ing. But the speaker may have merits or demerits. When they are taken into consideration it is determined whether these words of the speaker have been rightly or wrongly used.
tad uktaṃ pramāṇāntaradarśanam atra bādhyate iti //	It is this that they point to the relation which holds between a case and a verb.
ata eva pramāṇatvaṃ śabde niṣpratimaṃ svataḥ /	This or that sentence produces verbal knowledge without being disturbed as long as it does not face an opposi- tion.
śabde karmaṇi tatrāpi bādhakānupasarpaṇāt // tenāṅgulyagravākye 'pi śābdo 'styeva samanvayaḥ / ādhārādheyakriyādinirdebhānasyātra pratīyamānatvāt //	There is nothing wrong with the syntactical arrangement relating to words since the sentence consists of words which indicate the locative case, the subject standing upon the locus and the verb along with this meaning is clearly communicated If the said meanings were not communicated, the said sentence would not have been constructed.
vastuto 'saṃbhavo yas tu tulya eva sa āvayoḥ / ayogyatvena saṃsargapratītyarthanibarhiṇāt //	But, in reality, both of us hold the same view that it is an impossible feat for the meanings of words to be mutually related since they are not fit to be so related.
yadi tu śādo 'nvayo na bhavet kacataṭapādivarṇanirdeśamātram idaṃ syāt daśadāḍimādipralāpatulyaṃ vā syāt / ananvitābhidhānāt vākyatvam eva na bhavet / asti tu vākyatvam / tena manyāmahe asti śābdo 'nvaya iti atrāpi anvitābhidhānaṃ na viruddham /	If it is held that there is no syntactical arrangement of words in the above sentence then the so-called sentence should be a mere enumeration of several letters like a mention of letters such as ka, ca, ța, ta, pa, etc., but should not be a real sentence. If we take into consideration the mere syntactical arrangement of words in this case as we do in the case of the sentence "There are ten pomegranates' then the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna does not violate the rules of reasoning.
bādhakas tv anyaviṣaya eva na śabdasaṃsargaviṣaya ity uktam /	The opposition which it faces comes from another quarter but not from the quarter of words.
ata eva svasāmarthyasiddhanirnibandhabodhakatvavyāpāre śabde svato vedaprāmāṇyam anākulaṃ nirvakṣyati apauruṣeyatayā viplavāsaṃbhavāt /	Words have an intrinsic power by dint of which they operate smoothly. Under these circumstances we can botellý assert that the Vedas will carry their intrinsic validity, facing opposition.
svavyāpārasya ca svata eva śuddhatvam ity alam atiprasaṅgena // ity anvitābhidhānena vākyārthajñānasaṃbhāvāt /	As the Vedas do not owe their existence to an author so they do their work i.e., correctly convey their mean- ing without any hindrance. The knowledge which is derived from the Vedas bears the stamp of intrinsic validity.
tad etad api nānumanyate yad uktaṃ vṛddhavyavahārāt vyutpattir iti tat satyam /	Thus we see that if we subscribe to the hypothesis of anvita- abhidhāna, we can explain how a sentence communicates its meaning.
vākyena vyavahāra ity etad api satyam / śibikodyaṃcannṛva sarvāṇi padāni kārye saṃhatya vyāpriyanta ity etad api satyam eva //	It is also a truism that all verbal transactions are executed by means of sentences. It is a fact that all words, like the bearers of a palanquin, assemble toge- ther to convey the meaning of a sentence by their joint effort.
vyutpattiś cintyatām kim ekaghaṭanākārasaṅghātakāryaniṣṭhaiva sā kiṃ vā padārthaparyantā iti / pūrvasmin pakṣe prativākyaṃ vyutpattir aparihāryā /	Does he acquaint himself only with a composite meaning which is worked out by the totality of all words? Or, is he taught only the meaning of each word. Now, if one is to learn an indivisible whole of meaning then it is unavoidable for him to gather the meaning of each discrete sentence.
sā ca bahupramādety uktam /	In that case, as we have pointed out, learning will be impossible since sen- tences are infinite in number.
padārthaparyantāyāṃ tu vyutpattau nūnaṃ nirdhāraṇīyaṃ [iyān padasyārthaḥ] iti /	If the truth of the second suggestion is admitted, the exact meaning of each word should be ascertained.
bhavadbhir api śakaṭāvayavadṛṣṭāntavarṇanena padavyāpāranirdhāraṇam aṅgīkṛtam eva /	The propounders of the hypothesis of anvita- abhidhāna have cited an example, viz., the different parts of a carriage have distinct functions.
itarathā hi padārthaniyamānapekṣṇe gām ānayeti vivakṣāvān aśvapadam api nittitayopādadīta / na hi bhavatām anapekṣitapadārtha eva vaiyākaraṇānām iva vākyārthapratyayaḥ /	The narration of it suggests that the distinct function of each word is to be admitted. If the truth of the above suggestion is denied then the necessity of the knowledge of the etymological meaning of a word will not be required for the understanding of the meaning of a sentence.
tad asau yāvān āvāpodvāpaparyālocanayā gopadasyārtho nirdhāryate tāvān eva saṅghātakārye 'pi vyāpriyamāṇasya tasyārthaḥ //	By the joint method of agreement and difference one picks up the extent of the mean- ing of the word 'a cow'. The same extent of this meaning becomes active to constitute the meaning of a sentence in which the word 'a cow' finds a place.
nanu ākāṅkṣitayogyasannihitārthoparaktas tasyārha ity uktam naitad yuktam sarvadā saṃhatyavyāpriyamāṇam etat padaṃ paśyatas tavāyaṃ bhramaḥ /	O Mimãmsakas! You have held that the word 'cow' in855 Hypothesis of Anvita-abhidhāna Refuted question conveys its meaning qualified by such other meanings as are required, involve no material contradiction in order to be related and are in close proximity. You do not commit this mistake because the word 'cow' is always noticed as engaged in the service of a collection of words.
arthaḥ tāvān asya yāvaty abhidhātrī tasya śaktiḥ //	The word 'cow' conveys as much meaning as its force of conveying primary meaning permits it to do.
kiyati tasyābhidhātrī śaktiḥ kiyati tasyānabhidhātrī śaktiḥ yāvat tam arthaṃ anyonyam ākāṅkṣitaiś ca sannihitaiś ca saṃyujyamānaṃ na muṃcati //	We shall have to make out what is the exact primary meaning of a word, i.e., how much a word denotes and how much it does not do. Though the primary meaning of the word 'cow' is invariably associated with other meanings which are reciprocally required, are mutually related without involv- ing material contradiction, and are in close proximity yet it cannot be left out.
kiyantaṃ ca na muṃcati gotvamātraṃ tadvanmātraṃ vā ity atas tāvaty evābhidhātrī śaktir anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ asya nirdhāryate //	The meaning may be only the mere universal of cowness or the concrete universal. Thus the primary meaning of the word 'cow' maintains its identity in the midst of its relation with other meanings. This meaning cannot be ignored.
ataḥ param ekasya padasyāprayogāt sarvadā saṅghātakāryarahitakevalasvakāracāturyānavadhāraṇāt pradhānakārye tātparyaśaktir asya vyāpriyate nābhidhātrī /	The series of a colle- ction of words are essentially required for this purpose. Nobody has noticed the skill of a single word in constructing a sentence without having the aid of a collection of words. An individual word, being included in the collection of words, plays its part of conveying power of to convey the meaning of a sentence.
tāṃ ca pṛthag avivecayatā bhavatā anvitābhidhānam abhyupagatam /	recognise this distinct power of conveying the intended meaning, of convey- admit the truth of the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna.
tac ca nayuktam sarvatra abhidhātryāḥ śakter aviśeṣāt /	The ing the primary meaning has no special aptitude for the expression of one and all meanings.
padārthaniyamānavadhāraṇaṃ padāntaroccāraṇavaiphalyam ityādidoṣāṇām anapāyāt //	Its meaning is related to those of other words in it. Now, the word 'cow' should denote the related meaning by its power of conveying the primary meaning.
yenānvitam artham abhidadhāti gośabdaḥ tadanabhidhāne tadanvitānavagamāt yena saha saṃsargaḥ sa na gṛhyate tatsaṃsṛṣtaś ca gṛhyate iti vipratiṣiddhaṃ syāt /	If the second object is not denoted by the word 'cow' then the related meaning cannot be communicated by it. Thus the hypothesis amounts to this that an object which relates to a cow is not apprehended but a cow as related to it is presented to our consciousness.
tadabhidhāne vā tadvat sarvābhidhānam iti ekam eva gopadaṃ sarvārthaṃ bhavet /	Now, if the upholders of the said hypothesis admit that the word 'cow' also denotes the relation of a cow then they should admit that each word denotes all objects.
tasmān na sarvatrābhidhātrī śaktiḥ padasyopapadyate iti nānvitābhidhānam //	So, we hold that the power of expressing the primary meaning cannot logically communicate all shades of meanings which the words are competent to convey. Therefore, the hypothesis of anvita- abhidhāna is not tenable.
anvitābhidhānapakṣe ca katham aṅgulyagravākye 'pi nānvayaḥ syāt śābdo 'sty eva samanvaya iti cet arthāsaṃsparśī śabdaḥ prāpnoti bahiranvayābhāvāt /	As the meaning of the sentence involves material contradiction, how can a related meaning be denoted by a word? Now, they may contend that in the above case the syntactical relation is merely verbal and there is no actual relation between the meanings of words.
prakaśakatvamātraṃ vyāpāra iti cet bāḍham tat tv anvitānanvitaviṣayaṃ vedituṃ yuktam na punar anvitaviṣayam eveti śakyate niyantum / daśadāḍimādivākyam anvitārthapratipādakam api dṛśyate yataḥ /	Now, the upholders of the hypothesis may further contend that the function of a word is to reveal its meaning only but a word does not judge whether a meaning is consistent or not. The critics review this contention and hold that there is an element of857 Hypothesis of Abhihita-anoyaya truth in it that a word does not judge the consistency or other- wise of its meaning.
na tat vākyam iti cet aṅgulyagravākyam api na vākyam eva /	We cannot also frame a general proposition that all words cannot but denote related meanings.
ādhārādheyakriyāsaṃsargapratītis tu bhramamātram /	But the knowledge of the locus, the located, the verb and their relation is merely illusory.
tasmāt anvitam artham abhidadhati padānīty asamīcīnam //	Therefore, the hypothesis that words denote related meanings does not stand to reason.
tat kim ayaś śalākākalpāḥ parasparam asaṃsṛṣṭā eva padārthāḥ padair ucyantām etad api nāsti /	If words denote Do words denote such meanings as stand mutually unrelated like iron-pikes ? A hypothesis which points a view like this is not also sound since usage does not justify it.
tathāvidhavyavahārābhāvāt / paścād anvayasya ca duravagamatvāt viramyavyāpārasya cāsaṃvedanāt / tasmāt pakṣdvayam api na kṣemāya /	Thus, the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya does not get the sanction of our experience. Therefore, the above two hypotheses, i.e., the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhana and that of abhihita-anvaya, do not come off well.
tad uktam matadvayam apīdaṃ tu nāsmabhyaṃ rocatetarām /	Some critics have said to this effect. The above two hypo- theses do not hit our fancy.
kuto ' nvitābhidhānaṃ vā kuto vā 'bhihitānvayaḥ //	Another Hypothesis and Its Refutation.
anyā tu vāco yuktiḥ kaiś cit kṛtā anvīyamānābhidhānaṃ abhidhīyamānānvayaś ceti /	quibbles and hold that words Some other logicians use denote meanings which, being related point to the relation of such meanings as are being expressed.
sā 'pi na hṛdayaṅgamā //	This hypothesis is not to our taste.
na hi dve anubhūyete kriye ete pṛthak asthite /	These These two distinct acts are not experienced by us.
abhidhānakriyā cānyā vācyasthā cānvayakriyā //	two acts have been mentioned thus :-One is the act of858 expressing the meanings and the other is the act of relating them.
te hi krameṇa vā syātām yugapad vā kramapakṣe pūrvam anvayakriyā cet tad idam anvitābhidhānam eva nānvīyamānābhidhānam /	Do these acts occur successively or simultaneously? If they take place successively and if the act of relating precedes then the new hypothesis is nothing but that of anvita-abhidhāna.
pūrvaṃ ced abhidhānakriyā so 'yam abhihitānvaya eva nābhidhīyamānānvayaḥ /	Again, if words convey their meanings at first then it is the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya but not that of abhidhīyamāna-anvaya (the relation of meanings being expressed).
yugapat tu kriyādvayasaṃvedana nāsti /	These two acts are not simultaneously experienced.
arthagatāyāḥ kriyāyāḥ śabdaprayogakāle 'nupalambhāt //	When words are employed the act of relating which refers to meanings is not experienced.
abhidhānakriyaivaikā tadabhijñaiḥ parīkṣyate /	The judgement that this is a white cow points to the co-ordination of the two properties of an individual cow.
anvīyamānatā 'thānāṃ abhidhānād vinā kutaḥ // gauḥ śukla iti jātiguṇayor ekadravyasamavetayor api śabdam antareṇa kuto 'nvayam avagaccāmḥ //	If there are no terms to indicate their co-ordination then how can we grasp their mutual relation? Thus we see that the propounders of the two hypotheses, viz., the hypothesis of anviyamāna-abhidhāâna and that of abhidhiyamāna-anvaya simply play upon words.
ukter nūtananataivevyaṃ na punar vastu nūtanam /	They have coined new words only. They express no new objects which are experienced by us.
na cātrāpi nivartante doṣāḥ pakṣadvayaspṛśaḥ //	All defects which cling to the above two hypotheses do not fail to infect it.
anye manyante samānyenānvitābhidhanam viśeṣataś cābhihitānvaya iti / gośabdo hi svārtham anavagataviśeṣaguṇakriyāsāmānyānvitam abhidhatte tāvaty anvitābhidhānam /	The Knowledge of meanings in Relation by means of Tâtparya-Sakti Some logicians hold that the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna represents the rough draft of the real thesis but that of abhihita- anvaya stands for the minute draft of it.
śuklādiguṇaviśeṣabandhas tu padāntarād avagamyate /	If the relation of a cow to a specific attribute such as the colour 'white' etc..
so 'yaṃ viśeṣo 'bhihitānvaya iti etad api tādṛg eva // doṣo ' nvitābhidhāne yaḥ sāmānye 'pi sa tādṛśaḥ /	is commu- nicated by other words and a minute information is thus given then the hypothesis is known as abhihita-anvaya.
na cedam apūrvavastu vaṇitam /	This new exposition makes no improvement upon the old one.
abhihitānvayavādinaḥ viśeṣa evābhihitānvayam icchanti / sāmānye 'pi hi padaṃ vartate viśeṣe vākyam /	The same defects as have been shown to vitiate the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya infect its new explanation, viz., the relation of the meaning of a word to a specific attribute etc., is conveyed by other words.
vākyārthapratītaye ca abhihitānvaya āśrīyate iti prāktana eveṣṭaḥ panthā veditavyaḥ //	When the specific meaning of a sentence is stated the hypothesis of abhihita-anvaya is adhered to. Thus it is evident that the ancient path is welcome to convey the meaning of a sentence.
kathaṃ tarhy ābhidhānikī vyavahāraḥ saṅkulam ivainaṃ paśyāmaḥ sarvatra doṣasaṃbhavāt ucyate na kadā cid atra saṅkulatā /	How do you explain everything by adopting the routine method that words point to the meaning of a sentence only by their power of expressing primary meanings? But we find that this path is also beset with various troubles as all the previous hypo- thesis are infected with many defects.
saṃhatyakārīṇi hi padānīty uktam / samuditaiḥ padair eko vākyārthaḥ pratyāyyate / sa ca guṇaguṇibhūtetarapadārthasaṃsṛṣṭaḥ kaścit padārtha eveti kim atra saṅkulam //	The meaning of a sentence which all words conjointly communicate is nothing but the meaning of a principal word as related to the meanings of other subordinate words. In other words, the meaning of a sentence is nothing but the organization of the meanings of words in which one plays the important part and others play the secondary ones.
nanu kim ayam anvitābhidhānapakṣaḥ punar utthāpayitum iṣṭaḥ maivam nedam anvitābhidhānam /	Do you intend to revive the old hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna? They say in reply "No sir! the hypothesis in question is not that of anvita-abhi- dhana'.
kathaṃ tarhi saṃhatyakāritā padānām ucyate saṃhatyakāritā 'py asti na cānvitābhidhānam /	The critics ask, 'If this is not the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna, how is it that words conjointly express the meaning of a sentence ?' The defenders give the following answer 'Though these words conjointly express the meaning860 of a sentence yet this is not the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna.
anvitam arthaṃ padāni saṃhatya saṃpādayanti na tv anvitam abhidadhati /	Words conjointly bring about the related meaning but do not convey the related meaning'.
kim idānīṃ kurvanti vākyārthaṃ padāni ghaṭam iva mṛdādīni etad api nāsti jñāpakatvāt teṣām / kā tarhīyaṃ vācoyuktiḥ saṃhatyakārīṇi padāni na cānvitam abhidadhatīti iyaṃ vācoyuktiḥ /	The objectors again ask 'what do you say? Do words conjointly produce the meanings of a sentence as lumps of earth and other factors in mutual co-ope- ration produce a jar? The defenders answer, "This is not so since words simply indicate the above meaning but do not produce it'.
padāny anvitaṃ pratyāyanti nānvitam abhidadhati //	The power of conveying the primary meaning does not point to the related meaning.
nābhidhātrī śaktir anvitaviṣayā kin tv anvayavyatirekānugataniṣkṛṣṭasvārthaviṣyaiva / tātparyaśaktis tu teṣām anvitāvagamaparyantā saha vyāpārāt vyāpārasyaitadīyasya nirākāṅkṣapratyayotpādanaparyantatvat /	But the joint method of agreement and diffe- rence reveals the exact meaning of each word.' But these words have another power which is called Tātparya-śakti. The fun- ction of this power is to reveal the meanings of words contained in a sentence, as being in relation with one another since this power is the common effect of powers belonging to all words.
tathā hi anathaiva pravartante pratyakṣādyudbhavā dhiyaḥ /	Perceptual or indirect non-verbal knowledge reveals its object in different manner.
arthaṃ pūrṇam apūrṇaṃ vā darśayantyaḥ puraḥ sthitam //	It incompletely or completely reveals its object which is in front of us.
anyathaiva matiś śābdī viṣyeṣu vijṛmbhate / pratipattur anākāṅkṣapratyayotpādanāvidhiḥ //	But verbal knowledge is a class in itself. Its working is abso- lutely different. Words go on functioning unless and until a self-contained judgment is not produced.
ata eva padaṃ loke kevalaṃ na prayujyate /	For this reason, in this world, a single word is never employed.
na hi tena nirākāṅkṣā śrotur ādhīyate matiḥ //	Because a single word cannot produce as much knowledge as purpose of a listener.
nanu abhidhānavyatiriktaḥ ko 'nyaḥ śabdasya kṛtsnaphalaparyantaḥ pratyāyanātmā vyāpāraḥ asti kaścit yaḥ sarvair eva saṃsargavādibhir apratyākhyeyaḥ /	It is this—Do words possess some other power beside the power of expressing their primary meanings? Is it conducive to a complete result? (A complete result stands for a self-contained judgment).
na hi saṃsargo 'bhidhīyate pratīyate ca vākyāt //	This sugg- estion is not tenable.
nanu saṃsṛṣṭābhidhāne sati saṃsargaḥ pratīyeta nānyathā naitad evam saṃhatyakāritvād eva saṃsargāvagatisiddheḥ / na hi saṃhatyakaraṇam asaṃsṛṣṭaṃ ca kāryaṃ kva cit dṛśyate //	The meanings of words are bound up together by means of a relation since words denoting these meanings work conjointly since if causes produce jointly their effects then these effects are never seen to remain isolated.
api ca prakṛtipratyayau parasparāpekṣam artham abhidadhāte /	A stem and a suffix, attached to it, imply each other and convey their meanings jointly.
na ca prakṛtyā pratyayārthī 'bhidhīyate niyogasyādhātuvācyatvāt / na ca pratyayena prakṛtyartho 'bhidhīyate niyogādeḥ liṅvācyatvānupapatteḥ /	But a stem does not denote the mean- ings of a suffix since an injunction, the meaning of a lin suffix, is not denoted by the basic root, yaj, and the lin suffix does not denote the meaning of a basic root, such as yaj.
na ca tau pṛthak pṛthak svakāryaṃ kurutaḥ /	They do not independently bring about their effects.
evaṃ padāny api parasparāpekṣīṇi saṃhatya kāryaṃ kariṣyanti / na ca parasparam artham abhidhāsyanti vakyāny api prakaraṇapatitāny evam eva /	Similarly, words conjointly produce their own effects but one word does not denote the meaning of another word. Sentences also convey their meanings with reference to their context but point to no independent meanings.
tad uktam [prakṛtipratyayau yadvat apekṣete parasparam /	This view has been express- ed by some other thinkers.
padaṃ padāntaraṃ tadvat vākyāntaraṃ tathā] iti //	As a stem and its suffix împly each other so a word implies another and a sentence implies another.
ayam eva pakṣaḥ śreyān yat saṃhatyakāritvaṃ padānāṃ asaṃkīrṇārthatvaṃ ca //	861 This hypothesis is better. According to it words conjointly produce their effects but the meanings conveyed by words, maintain their individuality but do not interpenetrate.
nirapekṣe prayoge 'yaśśalākākalpanā bhavet / tadanvitābhidhāne tu padāntaram anarthakam // saṃhatyakāripakṣe tu doṣo naiko 'pi vidyate /	But if the hypothesis of anvita-abhidhāna is adhered to then the use of words other than one in a sentence becomes superfluous. But if we stick to the hypothesis that words conjointly com- munícate their meanings then it becomes free from all defects.
tenāyam upagantavyaḥ mārgo vigatakaṇṭakaḥ //	This path should be followed since it is not beset with thorns.
abhidhātrī matā śaktiḥ padānāṃ svārthaniṣṭhatā / teṣāṃ tātparyaśaktis tu saṃsargāvagamāvidhiḥ //	We agree to the point that words have power to denote their own primary meanings. They have an additional power which is called 'Tătparya-śakti'.
tenānvitābhidhānaṃ hi nāsmābhir iha mṛṣyate /	Hence, we do not subscribe to the hypothesis of anvita-abhi- dhana.
saṃhatyakārakatvāc ca padānāṃ na svārthābhidhitsayaiva samuccāraṇam api tu pradhānaṃ kāryam eva kartum / tad uktam [vākyārthamitaye teṣāṃ pravṛttau nāntarīyakam /	We utter words with this object in view that they will con- jointly produce their main effect but not that they will merely communicate their own primary meanings. In other words, we utter words with the intention of communicating the meaning of a sentence.
pāke jvāleva kāṣṭhānāṃ padārthapratipādanam] iti //	Similarly, sticks of wood burn in order to accomplish their main task, viz., the act of cooking.
seyaṃ vyutpattimūlā padavisarasamudbhidyamānāṅkuraśrīḥ saṃskārodārapatrā kusumacayavatī prollasadbhiḥ padārthaiḥ /	The arrangement of words is its bright sprout. The impressions due to the experience of all antecedent letters are its broad leaves. The meanings of ords which have been expressed are its full blown blossoms.
prajñāvallī viśālā phalati phalam idaṃ svādu vakyārthatattvaṃ nairākāṃkṣyaṃ tu sāndre hṛdaya upagate yānti yasmin pumaṃsaḥ //	The excellent meaning of a sentence is its palatable fruit. One should not put it in mouth. It is to be put in heart. When it enters our heart the listeners long for no other objects.
āha ca padāt prabhṛti ya caiṣā prajñā jñātur vujṛmbhate / puṣpitā sā padārtheṣu vākyārtheṣu phaliṣyati //	The knowledge which is derived from words by a listener blooms in the shape of the meanings of words and lastly bears fruits in the shape of the meaning of a sentence.
tasmād anyā nītyā saṃsargapratyayo bhavati sādhuḥ /	The knowledge which follows from this method is sound.
saṃsṛṣṭāś ca padārthāḥ vākyārtha iti nyavedi prāk // yaś caiṣa lokavyavahārasiddhiḥ prādarśi vakyārthamitāv upāyaḥ /	We have said before that the meanings of words, being mutually related, constitute the meaning of a sentence. An objection to the ascertainment of the Meaning of the Vedas The path to ascertain the meaning of a sentence has been shown before.
sa eva vede 'py avadhāraṇīyaḥ tatrāpi tāny eva padāni te 'rthāḥ // āha loke pramāṇāntaraparicchedyatvāt vākyārthasya tadavagamopāyatvaṃ śabdānāṃ yojayituṃ śakyate /	The same path will help to determine the meaning of the Vedas since the words which are used in the classical Sanskrit863, Hypothesis that Meaning of the Vedas are not ascertainable language have also been used in the Vedic Sanskrit in the same sense. the Some critics raise an objection to this effect.
vedārthas tu atīndriyaḥ /	The objects which are denoted by the Vedic sentences are supersensuous.
na ca rāgādidoṣakaluṣamanasām asmadādīnāṃ atīndriyapaddārthadarśanakauśalam asti /	We who are ordinary people have our mind polluted by impurities such as love, hatred etc. We possess no power of seeing transcendental objects.
tadadarśane ca tatra vṛddhavyavahārāt vyutpattir eva na saṃbhavati /	One who is not endowed with the mystic power of intuiting supersensuous objects is not initiated into the meaning of the Vedas, observing usage of the experienced persons.
so 'ham adya vedārthaṃ bubhutsamāno vedavidaṃ kaṃ cid ācāryam abhigaccheyam /	Suppose I desire today to learn the meaning of the Vedas and may approach an expert teacher for this purpose.
so 'py atīndriyārthadarśī na bhavatīti tasyāpi tathiva vyutpattyabhāva iti tenāpy anyaḥ kaścid abhigantavyaḥ /	But he also cannot intuit supersensuous objects. So, his knowledge of the Vedas is not up to the mark. As his knowledge is limited so he will have to approach an- other teacher in order to receive proper instructions.
so 'py anyam ity andhaparamparā prāpnoti /	He will also wait upon another.

Hence, the true meaning of the Vedas is incomprehensible.
na vedayati vedo 'pi vedārthasya kuto gatiḥ] iti //	The Vedas themselves do not explain their own meaning.

Now, if one may argue that a learner is initiated into the meaning of the Vedas with the help of their accessories suchNyāyamanjari as Nigama, Nirukta, and Vyakaraṇa. Such an argument is not sound. The reason is as follows. The authors of these works agree to differ.

tad etat badhirasya rāmāyaṇaṃ varṇitam asmābhiḥ yū evam api śrutvā vedārthaparigamābhiupāyaṃ mṛgayate /	Now we under- stand that all our previous discussions about the Vedas are like the recital of the Rāmāyaṇa before a deaf person. These critics have heard everything with regard to the ways and means of finding out the meaning of the Vedas.
anena hi pavaktina vākyārthaparigamopāya prakaṭanena sarvam apākṛtaṃ bhavati /	All problems, raised by the critics, stand refuted since the ways and means of interpreting the Vedas have been revealed.
uktaṃ hi nābhinavāḥ kecana vaidikāḥ śabdāḥ /	We have said that there is no new Vedic word.
racanāmātraṃ vede bhidyate na tu padāni /	But words which have been arranged are not diffe- rent from those used in the classical Sanskrit language.
sargāt prabhṛti ca pravṛtto 'yaṃ vedavidāṃ vyavahāraḥ / tat eva dīrghaprabandhapravṛttāt adyatve vayasi vyutpadyāmahe /	From the very dawn of creation the tradition of the Vedic scholars has been working. I had learnt the meaning of the Vedas long, long ago in my previous birth.

But it is not a fact that such a person who is desirous of Heaven will not be able to understand that the Vedic sentence 'Agni- hotrati juhuyāt svarga-kamah' points to the meaning 'Agni hotra sacrifice is a means to the attainment of heaven.' Now, a question may be raised, viz., "How do we receive regular training in the supersensuous matter?' We have said before 864Hypothesis that Meanings of the Vedas are not ascertainable 865 what we have got to say with regard to this problem.
vedārthaś ca tadavagamaś ca tadupāyaś ca tadanuṣṭhānaṃ ca nādyatve pravṛttāni /	The Vedas, their meanings, their knowledge, their accessories and the performance of the Vedic rites are not events of our modern age.

Some wicked critics have disgraced the Vedas with the damaging interpretation of the Vedic sentence, viz., 'One should eat the flesh of a dog." The only object which they will accomplish is that they will be ornamental flowers of hell. No novel criticism has been offered by them.
athāpara āha kim eṣa tapasvī parāṇudyate kiyanenāparāddham kim anena viruddham abhihitam na hi lokato vedārthe vyutpattir avakalpate //	Some other thinkers take an exception to this criticism. They say 'why do you take them to task? Have they offended against the law? Have they made any inconsistent remark?' One cannot learn the meaning of the Vedas from an ordinary person.

tatra śākaṭikāḥ sādhuśabdaprayogānabhijñamanaso nisargata evākṣatakaṇṭhāḥ varākāḥ saṃskārabāhyaiḥ gāvyādibhir eva śabdair vyavaharanti /	They are in the habit of using vulgar words in a loud tone. These words are 'gavi' etc.

Though the rustic people employ a few sanskrit words, e.g., in Kasmir they use eşi, emi etc., in Darvabhisāra 'gaccha' etc., and in Madra 'karomi', etc, yet their words are very small in number. The usage of such words is very limited since these persons are ignorant of the Vedic Literature. Now, the defenders of the Vedic tradition may agree in the following line.
atha vyākaraṇasya vedāṅgatvāt tataḥ sādhvasādhuśabdapravibhāgam avagacchantaḥ [sādhubhir bhāṣitavyaṃ asādhubhir na] iti vidhiniṣedhaniyamitamatayḥ sādhubhir eva śabdair vyavaharanto vidvāṃsaḥ tanīyasaiva kleśena vaidikeṣv api śabdeṣu vyutpattim āsādayeyur iti kathyate tad api na caturaśram itaretarāśrayaprasaṅgāt /	The science of Sanskrit Grammar is ancillary to the Vedas. One distinguishes with its help the correct words from the incorrect ones. His mind is restrained by the following injunction-cum-prohibition that a learned man should use correct words in speaking but should not use incorrect ones. Thus, learned men always attend to their work, using correct words only. It has been thus suggested that learned men may acquire proficiency in the Vedic Literature with little effort.Nyāyamanjari This suggestion is not sound because it involves circular reasoning.

When one is initiated into them his acquaintance with the Vedic vocabulary helps him to understand the Vedic work. Thus, the charge against the Vedas that they are unin- telligible is answered. Then and then only the Vedas are considered to be the source of true knowledge.

The Vedas depend upon the grammar and the grammar depends upon the Vedas. Now, the defenders of the Vedic tradition may take up a different line of argument. They may contend thus-If one discards with contempt the traditional view that Grammar is ancillary to the Vedas but reads grammar at his sweet will and learns to distinguish the correct words from the incorrect ones then the above hypothesis is not open to the fallacy of circular reasoning.

If the said defender admits the truth of this new suggestion then the science of grammar will be no more treated to be affiliated to the Vedas as their ancillary science like a work on Indian dialects. In that case it should be admitted that the usages of Indian dialects help to understand the meanings of the Vedic words.

atha vyākaraṇam eva vedārthavyutpattau upāyatāṃ pratipatsyate iti manyase tad api katham iti cintyam /	866 Another point in criticism deserves mention. One may acquire sound knowledge of grammar. He may receive instru- ction from a truthful person that he should always use correct words in speaking.

A doubt, viz., whether his interpretation is right or wrong may arise in our mind.

This contention is met thus. Let us examine the character of the injunction and the prohibition in question.

Or, are they known to a well circulated topic? Or, does it deserve discussion ?868 ! The Distinction Between Chaste and Vulgar Words is not Tenable Let this discussion be stopped since it is a very long one. There are no such words as bear the lable 'chaste' and similarly the label 'vulgar' is not attached to some other words.

Therefore, an injunction concerning Vrihis or a prohibition with regard to kalañjas is not impossible to understand. But as one knows what is Vrihi and what is Kalañja from the common people so he does not know the distinction between chaste and vulgar words from the same source.
pratyakṣaṃ tāvat sādhvasādhuśabdapravivekena lokato 'vagamyate /	(Hence, an injunction prescribing the use of chaste words and a pro- hibition restricting the use of vulgar words remain ever obscure).

na jātu tadgataṃ sādhutvam asādhutvaṃ vā /	But the chastity or otherwise of words is never directly apprehended.
na hi śabdatvādijātivat udāttādidharmavac ca sādhvasādhutāyāṃ kasyacid api śraitraḥ pratyayaḥ prasarati /	As one senses the universal of soundness belonging to all sounds or the qualities of sound viz., different accents so he does not perceive with his ears the chastity or otherwise-ness of a word.
pratyakṣapratiṣedhe ca sati tatpūrvakasaṃbandhagrahaṇāsaṃbhavāt anumānam api niravakāśam eva /	As we do not perceive the chastity or otherwiseness of a word so we cannot infer it since an inference is invariably based upon perception which lies at the root of generalisation.
śabdas tu dvividhaḥ puruṣapraṇītaḥ vaidiko vā /	There are two types of words viz. (1) words coined by human beings and words used in the Vedic Literature.
tatra puruṣapraṇītaḥ pratyakṣānumānaviṣayīkṛtārthapratipādanapravaṇa eva bhavati iti tadapākaraṇād eva parākṛtaḥ /	Of these two types of words, what has been coined by human beings denotes an object which is either perceived or inferred. As the chastity or otherwiseness of a word is neither perceived nor inferred so chaste or vulgar words do not owe their origin to human agency.
vaidikas tu saṃprati cintyo vartate /	Vedic words are now to be discussed.
sa hi siddhe sādhvasādhutve tadvidhiniṣedhe vyāpriyate /	If the chastity of these words is established then they may come within the province of injunction and if their non-chastity is proved then they may fall within the jurisdiction of prohibition.
na punaḥ tata eva tatsidhir yujyate /	In that case we cannot admit the truth of following statement viz.
tathā 'bhyupagame vāduruttaram itaretarāśrayatvam avatarati vidhiniṣedhasiddhau sādhvasādhuśabdasiddhiḥ sādhvasādhuśabdasiddhau ca vidhiniṣedhasiddhir iti //	If injunction and prohibition are established then the existence of chaste and non-chaste words is proved. Again, if the existence of these words is established then the existence of injunction and of prohibition is proved beyond dispute.
kiṃ cedaṃ sādhutvaṃ nāma yadi vācakatvam gāvyādayo 'pi sutarāṃ vācakā iti te 'pi kathaṃ na sādhavaḥ arthāvagatisādhanād dhi sādhutvam / tac ca yathā gāvyādiṣu jhaṭity eva bhavati na tathā gavādiṣv iti prathamaṃ ta eva sādhavaḥ //	Why are not they to be treated as chaste words? If the communication of meaning decides the chastity of a word then words like gavi etc. more quickly carry their sense than words such as 'go' etc., Hence, the so-called chaste words such as 'go' etc., firstly become non-chaste. Some hold that non-chaste words cannot directly convey their sense. They convey their meaning through the medium of their basic chaste words which are inferred.
evaṃ ca yad āhuḥ [asādhur anumānena vācakaḥ kaiś cid iṣyate] iti tadatyantam asāṃpratamaḥ sopānāntarapratītiprasakteḥ viparyayasya ca loke prasiddhatvāt //	Hence how will it be possible for him to infer the meaning of a vulgar word from that of a chaste one ? The learned scholars who are helmsmen in the ocean of870 grammatical literature and are in constant touch with nice .expressions do not indirectly grasp the meanings of vulgar words when they use them. In other words, they do not think in terms of Sanskrit words and gather the sense of other words through the medium of Sanskrit words.

As such power belongs to chaste words such as 'go', etc. so it belongs to non-chaste words viz., 'gavi' etc. So, these non-chaste words may be considered as chaste ones. If the nonchastity of a word stands for the non-communication of meaning then it exclusively belongs to the cawing of a crow etc.
tasmāt vācakatvam eva sādhutvam /	Hence, the vulgar words are not non-chaste.
etac ca gavādiṣv iva gāvyādiṣu dṛśyata iti te 'pi sādhavaḥ syuḥ //	This power of denotation is equally shared by words like 'go' etc., and also by words such as 'gavi' etc.
asādhutvam apy avācakatvam ucyate /	So, these non-chaste words may be considered as chaste ones.
tac ca vāyasavāśitādiṣu vyavasthitaṃ na varṇātmakeṣu vyaktavāguccāryamāṇeṣu śabdeṣv iti na te 'sādhavaḥ // brūyāt nārthapratītisādhanatvamātraṃ sādhutvam dhūmādibhir ativyāpteḥ /	But non- chastity does not belong to articulate sounds consisting of letters. Hence, the vulgar words are not non-chaste. Now, an objector may argue the chastity of a word is not merely the pointing to an object since such a definition is too wide. It also applies to smoke and such other objects which indicate some other objects.
api tu viśiṣṭakriyākaraṇatvam /	But the power of denotation is that which tends to bring about some specific acts.
tac ca gavādiṣv evāsti na gāvyādiṣv iti na te sādhava iti etad api asmīkṣitābhidhānam abhidhānakriyākāraṇatvaṃ hi vācakatvam iti pūrvam eva sunipuṇam upapāditam /	power belongs to words like 'go' etc., but does not belong to Such words e.g. 'gavi' etc. Hence, words like 'gavi' etc., are not chaste. " The above criticism has been offered by a person who lacks far sight. A denotative word is that which conveys a primary meaning.
tac ca gavādiṣu gāvyādiṣu ca samānam iti sarva eva sādhavaḥ //	This power of denotation is equally shared by words like 'go' etc., and also by words such as 'gavi' etc.
atha lakṣaṇānugatatvaṃ tadbāhyatvaṃ ca sādhutvam asādhutvaṃ ca varṇyate tad ayuktam pāribhāṣikatvaprasaṅgāt /	Now, the critics may argue that words which obey the rules of Sanskrit Etymology are chaste and those which do not obey such rules are nonchaste. This argument is logically tenable since the procedure adopted by the science of Etymology is purely conventional.
na cānyat kim api sādhvasādhulakṣaṇam atisūkṣmayā 'pi dṛṣṭyā śakyam utprekṣitum /	So its findings are not absolute. Our mature intellect fails to invent any new definition of chaste and nonchaste words.
ato vācakāvācakāv eva sādhvasādhū iti sthitam // tena tayoḥ pravartamānau vidhiniṣedhāv imau vyathau bhavetām /	Hence, we reaffirm the conclusion that a denotative word is chaste and a nondenotative word is nonchaste. Hence, an injunction concerning chaste words and a prohibition withHypothesis that Vedas are unintelligible -871 regard to non-chaste words should be futile.
katham sādhubhir bhāṣiṇo tāvat prāptatvān na vidhīyate / avācakaniṣedhaś ca nāprāpter avakalpate //	Why shall we issue an injunction to this effect? "One shall not speak non-sense" is also well known. Why does a prohibi- tion come in? As speaking is not possible so the prohibition of speaking non-sense is meaningless.
na hi [salilaṃ pibet] [analaṃ na pibet] iti vidhiniṣedhau saṃbhavataḥ /	As the injunction, 'One should drink water', is absurd so the prohibition 'One should not cat fire', is equally absurd.
salilapānasya svataḥ prāptatvāt aprāpte ca śāstrasyārthavattvāt /	What is enjoined by the Sastras is beyond the reach of normal activities of a person.
jvalanapānasya ca kasyāṃ cid apy avasthāyāṃ aprāpteḥ pratiṣedhānarthakyāt /	As under no circumstances it is possible for one to eat fire so any prohibition with regard to it is unnecessary.
prāptipūrvikā hi pratiṣedhā bhavanti /	The general rule which governs prohibition is this that what is possible is prohibited.
na hi grīṣme jvālāyamānamāravamārgabhramaṇojjhṛmbhitatṛṣātiśayatanūkṛtatanur api tanūnapātaṃ pātuṃ lavaṇopayogopanītatṛṅvikāraḥ karabho 'pi yateteti //	Even a camel, being afflicted by the heat of summer, will not try to eat fire in order to quench his thirst. Now, the critics may argue in the following manner.
tatraitat syāt gavāder gāvyādeś ca vācakatvāviśeṣe 'pi sādhvasādhuśabdoccāraṇakaraṇakapuṇyapāpaprāptiparihāraprayojananiyamavidhānāya śāstrasāphalyaṃ bhaviṣyati /	Though words like 'go' etc. and words like 'gavi' ctc. are equally denotative yet an injunction and a prohibition are fruitful since their function is to impose restriction upon the indis- criminate use of words. The use of non-chaste words injoin- ed,by the Šāstras entails merit.
tad uktam [vācakatvāviśeṣe 'pi niyamaḥ puṇyapāpayoḥ] iti etad api durghaṭam pratipadam aśakyatvāt vargīkaraṇanimittasya cāsaṃbhavāt /	Hence an injunction and a prohibition, recorded in the Sastras, are fruitful. It has been said by Kumarila that though words, chaste and nonchaste, are denotative alike yet a restriction, imposed upon their use, is significant since it regulates merit and demerít.
avaśyaṃ hi vidhiṃ vā niṣedhaṃ vā vidhitsatāṃ praviṣedhyāṃś ca niṣedhyāṃś ca śabdānupadarśya niyamo vidhātavyaḥ [ebhir bhāṣitavyaṃ ebhir na] iti /	When a restriction is to be imposed upon the use of words the use of which is to be enjoined should be individually mentioned and words the use of which is to be prohibited should be distinctly stated. The said injunction should be like this that one should utter these words.
tatra yady ubhaye te śabdāḥ prativyakti nāmagrahaṇaparigaṇanapuraśaram upadarśyeran tad ayam arthaḥ kalpaśatajīvinaḥ bhagavataḥ parameṣṭhino 'pi na viṣayaḥ pravitatavadanasahasrasaṃkulamūrter anantasyāpi na gocaraḥ vācaspater na bhūmiḥ sarasvatyā atibhāraḥ teṣām ānantyena darśayutum aśakyatvāt //	If this suggestion is accepted then the above words are to be mentioned indivi- dually and their number is also to be recorded. What will be the net result if they are individually mentioned and theirNyayamanjari number is counted. This task is impossible even for Brahmă, the personal creator of this world whose span of life extends over a hundred kalpas. It is also beyond the range of imagi- nation even of the god Ananta who has a thousand mouths wide open. It is also too difficult for the Lord of speech to perform.
atha kiṃ cid upalakṣaṇam avalamya teṣāṃ vargīkaraṇam upeyate hanta tarhi dṛśyatām na ca tat saṃbhavati //	But this grouping is possible if so exclusive common properties of these two groups are discovered. The critics remark that one may try to find out such common properties but it is not possible for him to find them out.
avibhaktā hi śabdatvajātiḥ śabdāpaśabdayoḥ /	The universal of soundness which belongs to chaste and non- chaste words is an indivisible entity.
na cāvāntarasāmānye ke cid vargadvaye sthite //	Words are not divided into two classes viz.

Though in the Šāstras restrictive injunctions have a necessity yet one has got to ex- plain what is the object of such injunctions. What is the pur- port of the injunction in question ? Does it mean that one should utter chaste words only but not non-chaste ones? Or, does it mean that he should only speak, uttering chaste words? Both meanings of the said injunction are infected with defects.
āha hi [yadi sādhubhir eveti nāsādhor aprasaṅgataḥ /	If one is enjoined to speak chaste words only then it is not possible for him to utter non-chaste words.
niyataṃ bhāṣitavyaṃ cet maune doṣaḥ prasajyate] iti //	Again, if one is enjoined to speak only then he will commit a sin when he will remain silent.
na ca vācakatvād anyat sādhutvam ity uktam avācakasya prayogaprasaṅga eva nāstīti // atha pramādā 'śaktikṛtāpaśabdaprayogapratiṣedhāya niyama āśrīyate tatrāpi pramādā 'śaktijāḥ śabdāḥ yadi tāvad avācakāḥ /	It has been said before that a word which denotes a me neaning is chaste and no other definition of chastity is possible. Hence, it is impossible to accept that what has no power to denote a meaning is to be taken as a word. Therefore, there are no such words as may be called unchaste or non-chaste.
teṣu prasaṅgo nāstīti tannivṛttiśrameṇa kim //	The drift of this argument is that the said prohibition is meaningless.
atha vācakatā teṣāṃ apramādotthaśaktivat /	Prohibition is directed towards these wrongly pronounced words.
na tarhi pratiṣedhaḥ syāt apramādotthaśaktivat //	In order to exclude their use the said prohibition that one should not speak non- chaste words has been given.

The critics join issue with the advo- cates and point out that as many examples of conveying one's ideas through the contraction of one's ideas through the con- traction of one's eye-balls, gestures of hands, and such other expressions are noticed so regulations should also be issued prohibiting their practice.
api ca vidhiphalaḥ sarvatra niyamo bhavati [ṛtāv upeyāt] ityādi /	In continuation of their criticism the critics remark that a restrictive injunction has a positive content.
niṣedhaphalā tu parisaṃkhyā [paṃca paṃcanakhā bhakṣyāḥ] iti /	The person enjoined is ordered to do something positive. But a parisamkhyā injunction has a negative import.

It has been said that a chaste word, properly used, produces the desired result in Heaven. This statement is not literally true.

As they are merely laudatory or con demnatory Arthavadas so chaste and vulgar words have noInefficacy of the Study of Grammar connection with transcendental results, i. e., merit and demerit. A rule, laid down in the Mimāṁsă sutra, clearly expresses the following decision that a material substance used in a sacrifice, viz., a special kind of ladle etc., any qualitative change of a sacrificer, and accessory sacrifices are means to an end but produce no transcendental result.

On the basis of this hearsay evidence the science of grammar is considered to be authoritative. But we shall hope against hope if we think that it (the science of grammar) is ancillary to the Vedas on the strength of the said weak evidence.

The universal application of the said injunction and the prohibition is not permissible.

vyākaraṇasya tu sudūram api dhāvanaplavane vidadhataḥ sādhuśabdaprayoganiyamadvārakam eva tadaṅgatvaṃ saṃbhāvyate na mārgāntareṇa /	Though grammar tries to attract attention by a show of runs and jumps yet it may be ancillary to the Vedas only because of the possible reason that it is a normative science which regulates the use of chaste words but not because of any other reason.
sa ca niyamo durupapāda iti darśitam /	The said function of grammar viz., the regulation of the use of chaste words is difficult to establish, This point has been brought home before.

In the above injunction con- cerning the study of the Vedas for their own sake the word 'niṣkāraṇa' has been used It indicates as much its non-utility but not so much its fruitfulness.

Therefore, some other passages which are often quoted to prove that grammar is an accessory of the Vedas do not serve the purpose. The passages are as follows: A Brahmin should not use vulgar expressions since a vulgar expression is barbarism'. If a chaste word is properly used, it fulfils the desire of its employer in heaven'. 'The in- stitutor of Agnihotra sacrifice having used vulgar expressions should observe an expiatory rite in honour of the Goddess of Learning'; and 'A speech which is strictly classical is worthy of its name'.

The drift of this argument is that the science of grammar has a sound footing to stand upon.

Are they savants who employ classical words such as 'go' etc? Or, are they savants who use vulgar words, e. g., 'gavi' etc., in speaking and writing? Or, are they savants who use both classical and vulgar words in speaking and writing? If the defenders answer the first alternative in the affirmative then they involve an unanswerable vicious circle since the science of grammar is based upon the usages of savants and savants are those who are proficient in the science of grammar.

Now, the defenders may contend that Pāṇini has made no mention of its utility because it may be easily guessed.

Dharma is not the goal of the study of grammar since it gives no such directions. Therefore, the hypothesis that Dharma is the goal of grammar has been refuted.

There is no injunction on the authority of which we shall take up the better study of words. A sacrificer is enjoined to put a horn, brought to scratch the body of an antelope, into a sacrificial hole. This act exerts a purifying influence upon the rite which has been observed.
[svādhyāyo 'dhyetavyaḥ] iti tu vidhiḥ abhimukhīkaraṇena māṇavakasya vā granthasya vā saṃskāram upadiśatīti mahatī carcaiṣā tiṣṭhatu /	It introduces some quali- tative changes to him as he is taken to a Vedic teacher for the learning of the Vedas. Upanayana ceremony is a symbol of the beginning of the Vedic study. Or, the said injunction exerts an influence upon the Vedas thus acquired.

For this reason it is certain that grammar cannot create such situation as helps the use of verbal expressions. Some may contend that theNyāyamañjari services of grammar cannot be dispensed with since it explains a few difficult compound words such as sthūlapṛṣatī etc. Such a contention is not tenable since Kalpa-sūtra, a work on rituals, and such other treatises will render the same service.

The compound words "Janikartuḥ" and "Tat- prayojakaḥ" are illustrations of Tat-purușa compound. The sixth case-ending has been dropped.
vārtikakāro 'pi [dambher halgṛhaṇasya jātivācakatvat siddham] iti tathaiva prayuktavān /	But the rule “Tṛjakā. bhyām kartari" opposes the formation of Tat-puruṣa compound in these two cases. Again, the term 'jani' denotes a root.

In other words no compound word should be treated as an abstract noun. The said suffix is also attached to such words as fall within the group of words having the word "Brāhmaṇa' at their head.
bhāṣyakāro 'pi [aviravikanyāyena] iti dvandvagarbhe tatpuruṣe prayuyukṣite [supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ] iti prāptam api lopaṃ na kṛtavān /	The author of bháşya on Pāņini's sūtras, has not dropped the case-ending, intending to use a compound word of the Tat-puruşa class, containing another compound word of the Dvandva-type in the analogy of the word 'avira-On the nature of chaste words vika'.

It is a matter of grave regret that these great personages have deviated from the path of duty i.e., the use of correct expressions. Whom shall we chastise? In Manu's treatise and such other works a large number of words which are irregularly formed is counted. He writes “Jõātāram antimetyuktva". The euphonic combination result- ing in 'antimeti' is not permissible.

He raises a question, viz., "which words are to be discussed?" He solves the problem by proposing to give instruction in classical and "Vedic words. But he fails to enumerate the number of classical and Vedic words.

Or, shall we take up many words at a time andNyayamanjari bring them under a general rule? It is an impossible feat to treat each word individually. The ancient teachers have ex- pressed their opinion regarding the subject-matter under dis- cussion.

He raises the problem and solves it thus: a word is to be analysed into two parts, viz., (1) its basic element and (2) inflexion attached to it and a general rule, determined by a qualification, is to be formulated.
tathā hi [karmaṇy aṇ] iti sāmānyalakṣaṇaṃ karmaṇy upapade dhātumātrād aṇpratyayo bhavatīti /	Let us take an example to illustrate the above procedure. The sutra karmaṇyan is a qualified general rule. The verbal suffix 'an' is attached to a verb.
[āto 'nupasarge kaḥ] iti viśeṣalakṣaṇam ākārāntād dhātoḥ upasargarahitāt karmaṇy upapade kapratyayo bhavatīti /	It is qualified by the word 'karmaṇi' karma is such as denotes an objective case and is penultimate.

The defenders of the utility of grammar hold that words such as kumbhakara, nagarakãra etc., are easily explained by means of the qualified general rule and many other words such as goda, kambalada etc., are also explained by general rules without any difficulty.
sāmānyaviśeṣavatā lakṣaṇeteti tu saṃpratinirūpyate /	We have already elaborately criticised the supposition that a word consists of two imaginary parts viz.

Such a rule is not without its defects since the determination of the two elements of a word is not exact. 884 Let us clearly state the ground of our objection.

Now, the grammarians may say by way of repartee that a root has been defined in the sutra 'Bhuvādayo dhatavah" and its characteristic feature has been indicated. Some words have been read as synonymsOn the nature of chaste words in an order of succession and several such groups have been included in the list of roots. These words have been defined as roots.

tad api hi vyastaṃ vā lakṣaṇaṃ samastaṃ vā vyavastapakṣe pratyekam abhihite doṣas tadavastha eva /	Thus, the definition of a root suffers from the defect of being too wide since according to your rule inflexion 'tin' is attached to a root.

Now, the grammarians may contend that a verb is such as denotes activity.
iha ca gatyantaramatispaṣṭam asti pramādaprabhavatvaṃ nāma /	If this is their contention then the roots 'to be' (bhū) and 'to stand' (stha) cease to be roots.

The purport of the object- ion is that fuels should not be taken as the instance of an ins- trumental case since they have no distinctive feature to indicate the above case-character, 888 A locative case is that which points to a locus.

In other words, does it contain a root or a case? If you define it precisely and hold that the container of a root (an action) is a locative case then all cases should be included in the class of locative case since all cases are syntactically connected with a root.

lajjasvaivaṃ bruvāṇaḥ /	One should rather say that he cooks in water.
atha ca na sthiraḥ indriavyāpāra iti grāhikatāmātram /	The point in objection is this that water directly contains rice which is being cooked but not a spot.
santāninirvaśeṣaḥ syāt santānaḥ kṣaṇabhaṅguraḥ / na sidhyet punar apy evaṃ vyavahāraḥ puroditaḥ //	Again, the illustration that he takes his food on a mat becomes grammati- cally incorrect since a mat is the container of a person who takes his food but not of the act of eating.
tad evaṃ sati santānacchadmano vinivāraṇāt / lokayātrā sthirair eva padārthair upapādyatām //	Now, the defender may revise the above definition of locative case and hold that a locative case is such as contains a root through the medium of both nominative and objective cases.

dṛṣṭārtheṣu ca vākyeṣu dṛṣṭā pratyakṣato 'pi sā // tasmād dṛṣṭasya kāryasya yuktā kāraṇakalpanā /	In that case, the locus of an objective case involves a reference to the locus of a nominative case and vice versa the locus of a nominative case involves a reference to the locus of an objective case.
rathādinā'pi nātivyāptiḥ yothoktaprakramavaśād eva [anyena preraṇāyām asatyām] iti viśeṣalābhāt /	Thus, the new revised definition of a locative case is in no way different from its immediate antecedent one.

ataḥ suṣṭhūktaṃ ceṣṭendriyārthāśrayaḥ śarīram iti // tad itthaṃ bhogāyatanatvena bandhahetutvād dheyam ity arthaḥ /	Now, if the defender holds that a locative case is the container of all cases then the illustration that he cooks rice on a pot should not be gramma- tically correct since a pot is not the locus of all cases.

Nobody can determine the most favourite one since an action to be accomplished being desired all cases are equally required for its completion by a subject, hence all of them are the most favourite ones.
tathā hikārakaṃ kārakatvād eva prāpyakāri bhavati /	Now, the con- tender may say that the goal of an action is the desideratum of a subject.
bhautikānām api dīpādīnāṃ paraṃ prakāśayatāṃ svātmaprakāśakatvam api dṛṣṭam /	The objector points out that the word to which the case-ending 'am' is attached stands for some thing which is other than an accusative case.

na khalu kṛṣṇasāraṃ cakṣuḥtadadhikaraṇaṃ tu tejaḥ cakṣuḥ /	A case stands for the cause of an action but an object is the result of an action but is not its cause.
kārakatvam eva tathā saty eṣām utsṛjema / kārakaṃ ca aprāpyakāri ceti citram //	It involves contradiction to hold that what is the cause of an action is also the most favourite desideratum to be achiev- ed by the same action.

tenādhiṣṭhānabhede 'pi kāryaikatvasya darśanāt /	In other words, an object is the final cause of an action.

asatsv api ca bhavatkalpiteṣukarmendriyeṣu tatkāryaṃ yāvat tāvad anyathāpi dṛśyate /	What is the final result cannot be said to be a means since pleasure and such other phenomena which are the mere goal of an action should also be called the means of it.
bhavaty utpāṭikṣasya na manāgapi rūpadhīḥ /	One should bear in mind that the designation 'case' does not depend upon the arbitrary will of the founder of a branch of study.
tasmāt na trayodaśavidhaṃ karaṇam iti siddham //	In other words, such a nomenclature is not due to the convention set up by a great teacher.

In the Sanskrit Grammar two types of the subjective case have been mentioned.

Are they correlative ab initio ? Or, they have become correlative on the strength of the conventional sūtra of Paņini viz.
sādhāraṇe 'pi vastuni parasya darśanādyasahanaṃ īrṣyā /	'Samarthaḥ pada-vidhiḥ'? In any case the term 'correlation' has got to be clearly explained.

They may say that the said meaning is revealed through the use of compound words and nominal suffixes and the knowledge of such uses.
mūḍhasya hi rāgadveṣau bhavataḥ mithyāsaṃkalpād utpadyamānayor anubhavāt / kusaṃkalpaś ca mithyājñānaprakṛtiḥ /	It is also evident that correla- tion is cognised if there are examples of compound words and nominal suffixes and they are cognised and that if correlation exists then the examples of compound words and their know- ledge becomes possible.

If a person speaks a sentence then he is a speaker. Suppose there is a place where nobody speaks. How do we say that there are noOn the nature of chaste words 893 speakers on the spot? Hence, these rules of grammar are not logically justifiable.

Thus, a sentence will be excluded from a nominal stem. In other words; the definition of a nominal stem as given by Panini is exact. If this is the contention of the followers of Panini then the critics may as well point out that the above definition of nominal stem should not contain two adjectives, viz.
na ca tatpratyakṣatvam atisūkṣmatvāt / ato dvābhyāṃ paramāṇubhyāṃ dvyaṇukam ādāv utpadyate //	(1) adhātuḥ (other than a verb) and (2) apratyayaḥ (other than an inflex- ion) since a verb and an inflexion will be excluded from the field of nominal stems on the strength of the special injunction.

tatra ca bahutvasaṃkhyayā mahattvam apy ārapsyate pratyakṣatvaṃ ca bhaviṣyati /	They simply hope against a hope.
tataḥ paraṃ tu kramasāmānye pramāṇam asti loṣṭādibhaṅge svāvayavakhaṇḍāvayavadarśanam / kramaviśeṣe tu pramāṇaṃ nāsti ittham ārambha iti /	The words which constitute an expounding sentence and those which con- stitute a compound word have no similar function. Hence, there is no necessity of holding that a compound word and its ex- pounding sentence have similar function.
yatra vā darśanam asti tatra tad astu kramaviṃśeṣe pramāṇam iti //	Moreover, it has been. established that a sentence is significant.
ārabhyārambhakatvaṃ teṣyate mūrtānāṃ samānadeśatvavirodhāt /	Hence, the definition of a nominal stem suffers from the defect of being too wide.
na hi paramāṇavaḥ prathamaṃ kāryam ārabhya tad anu ta evottarottarakālaṃ kāryāṇy ārabhante /	As a nominal stem has not been exactly defined so case- endings such as 'sup' etc., cannot be added to a nominal stem in accordance with the sūtra "ňyāp prātipadikāt" etc.

(2) In some cases, straight defini- tions have been refuted under the pretext that they contain redundant long vowels or that they involve greater quantity of syllables.
aniyataphalaṃ tu citrādi kaiścid uktam / tac ca yuktam ayuktam iti vā tatraiva parīkṣitam //	(3) In some cases, the interpreters hold that this plausible rule does not apply to this particular case because the commentator has not explicitly approved of its application.

The objectors cannot say to this effect "let them bear the burden of the chaste words." The reason is that one is directly aware of the fact that these words have assumed perverted forms.

yadi dvitayam avabhāti ayam artho nīlam idaṃ tajjñānam iti tat kim atra vicāryte jitaṃ bhavadbhiḥ /	What leads to formulate the canon is this that if it is accepted then the rela- tion of denotation holding between a word and its meaning is easy to establish.

In other words, why do not the uncultured persons imitate the practice of the cultured ones if chaste words are only competent enough to convey their meanings? An answer to this question is this :- the use of chaste words has been super- seded by that of vulgar words just as the communication of one's intention by means of the winking of an eye and the signal, given by hands, etc.
sa ca spaṣṭa eva nyāyasyāśrayaḥ /	has yielded place to the use of words of the lower caste non-Aryans.

We stick to the view that they do not possess the power of denotation.

The innate power of denotation or such power as has been imparted by God belongs only to words like 'go' etc., but not to deformed words suchOn the non-eternality of deformed words 901 as gavi etc.

How do such persons as are ignorant of words like 'go' etc., remember them? Which is the sure means of learning them ? A special study is the sure way of their access.

But our objector has said that the number of chaste words is so vast that none can get them by heart by hundreds of divine years.

As the Vedas distinguish virtue from vice, as the incarnation of God draws distinction between truth and false- hood, as the codes of Ethics differentiate between good and evil, as the instructions of Manu and others discriminate between the edible and non-edible, as an oath points out the difference of purity from impurity, so grammar shows the distinction between chaste and unchaste words.

na hi dṛṣṭāntadharmiṇi prajñātasāmarthyaṃ sādharmyam ubhayathā bhavati pakṣāntaraṃ spṛśati /	The objectors think that it is objectionable to hold that an injunction discharges two functions.
aniveśeṣasamāyāṃ ca jātau yat samādhānam uktaṃ tad ihāpi vaktavyam iti //	But our contention is that such functioning on the part of an injunction is not objectionable. Let us discuss another objection raised by our opponents.
pratiṣedhye śabde nityam anityatvasya bhāvaś ced ucyate tad anitya evāsāv ukto bhavati /	The purport of their criticism is as follows - The Vedíc sentences which speak of the reward or the punishment of an action are means to an end.
anityatvopapatteś ca tatpratiṣedho nopapadyate /	They enjoy no independence.
anityatvādabhāva iti tu vyavahāramātram /	Thus, they are only recommendatory in their character.
sā ceyam anityatā śabdāvacchinnā na śabdādhikaraṇā / na ghaṭābhāvaḥ ghaṭāśrayo bhavitum arhati /	As merit or demerit has no connection with rites suggested by recommendatory sentences so one who employs either chaste or unchaste words acquires neither merit nor demerit thereby.
abhāvatvāśrito 'pi na pratiyogyāśrito bhavati kin tv arthāntaravṛttiḥ bhūpradeśa iva ghaṭabhāva iti //	But the above objection does not stand to reason. Though a re- commendatory sentence is not an end in itself yet it insists upon the restricted use of chaste words.
prayatnakāryānekatvāt kāryasamaḥ //5.1.38//	Now, if one follows it, he acquires merit.
yady api prayatnakāryānyatvam upalabhyate tathāoi prakṛte śabde prayatnasyābhivyaktāv ahetutvam /	But the use of unchaste words is the violation of an injunction, i.e., of the above rule. Hence, a person who employs unchaste words commits a sin.
tadaphoham ācaratā prayatnena tad abhivyaktiḥ saṃpādyate /	The result is that demerit accrues to him. Now, our opponent may criticise this solution.
śabdasya tu na kiñcid anupalabdhinibandhanaṃ vyavadhānādi saṃbhavatīti varṇitam /	He may point out that the recommen- datory sentence "Juhu is to be made up of leaves" should have also connection with merit or demerit.
atas tasyāsata evātmalābhābhinimittam uccāraṇādiprayatnaḥ na sato 'bhivyaktinimittam / tasmād anityaḥ śabda iti siddham //	In other words, if one follows the instruction, given by the recommendatory sentence, he acquires merit and if one does not follow it, he commits a sin.
kathaṃ punaḥ ṣaṭpakṣī pravartata iti tatpathaṃ darśayitum āha pratiṣedhe hi samāno doṣaḥ //5.1.40//	Our answer to this charge is this that if such a consequence happens, wherein lies a defect? Let us clarify the standpoint of the Naiyāyikas.
vividhaḥ pratiṣedhaṃḥ ihocyate na vyāghātaḥ prakṛtasaṅgater abhāvāṭ /	The Naiyāyikas do not accept the division of the recommendatory sentences into two classes, viz., fruitful and fruitless.
svapakṣaḥ mūlasādhanavādyuktaḥ [prayatnānantarīyakatvād anityaḥ śabdaḥ] iti / tatlakṣaṇaḥ tatsamutthānaḥ tadviṣayaḥ [prayatnakāryānekatvāṭ]iti pratiṣedhaḥ /	They have also shown that the consti- tuent words of a recommendatory sentence convey a distinct meaning and purport and differ from those who believe in the hypotheses that there are fruitless recommendatory sentences in 909Nyayamanjari the explanation of these words.
tasyāṃ prathamatṛṭīyapaṃvamāḥ /	This point has been discussed before.
sthāpanāhetuvādinaḥ pakṣāḥ /	Let us stop here.
vācyam uttaram ato niravadyaṃ jātivādinam api prati tajjñaiḥ /	Hence, the Naiyāyikas hold that recom- mendatory sentences such as "If a word is properly employed, it fulfils our desires in the next world" are fruitful.
apratipattis tu ārambhaviṣaye 'nārambhaḥ / ārambhasya viṣayaḥ sādhane dūṣaṇaṃ dūṣaṇe coddhāraḥ /	The above re- commendatory sentence, cited by us, points to the study of the science of grammar, since if one does not go through grammar, he can hardly use chaste and correct words.
ata evānantaram āha tadvikalpāj jātinigrahasthānabahutvam //1.2.61//	Thus, the purport of the above sentence is that one should read grammar. It is virtually an injunction.
nānākalpo vikalpaḥ prakārabheda ityarthaḥ /	The other recommendatory sentences should be interpreted in this light.
[punaruktam adhikam] ity asamāsakaraṇena vipratipattyaiva vābhimatam / kim asamāsakliṣṭakalpanayā /	910 The opponents have also raised a question, viz., "Why has not Panini, himself, the author of grammatical sūtras, men- tioned the utility of the study of grammar".
sā 'pi hi kutsitaiva pratipattiḥ yat punaruktam adhikaṃ vā prayujyata iti / asaṅkīrṇodāharaṇavivakṣayā ca dvāviṃśatibhedasaṅkīrtanam /	Such an objection does not land us in difficulty, since the people all over India from the Himalayan region up to the Cape Comorin know very well that grammar is ancillary to the Vedas.
avāntarabhedais tu jātivad ānantyam eva teṣām iti //	If the Vedas are useless then let them who are ignorant of the Vedas be blessed.
atra kīrtir āha dvāviṃśatidhā nigrahasthānāni vibhajyante /	The baser persons who fall outside the pale of four castes will win a victory over us.
nigrahasthānam anyat tu na yuktam iti neṣyate //	Now, let us turn our attention to the other aspect of the problem.
vādinā siṣādhayiṣitapakṣasiddhaye sādhanam abhidheyam /	If the study of the Vedas is fruitful, the Vedas along with their ancillary sciences serve our purpose.
ato 'nyathā nigrahakaraṇam anyāyyam eva /	The accessory sciences have got no distinct utility to materialise.
nigṛhyate cet kim anenāparāddham nādoṣa udbhāvitaḥ //	There is no need of assuming any separate mission which they fulfil.
atha prasajyapratiṣedhenodbhāvanābhāva eva vyākhyāyate tarhi dūṣaṇābhāsodbhāvanam anumataṃ syāt /	No- body cares to expect a distinct fruit from the Prayāja sacrifice since a Prayǎja sacrifice is subordinate to the Darśa-Purņamāsa sacrifice.
evam asādhanāṅgavacanam api vikalpanīyam / prasajyapratiṣedhavṛttyā sādhanāṅgasyāvacanaṃ cet seyam apratipattiḥ /	As Pāṇini, the author of grammatical sūtras, is aware of the character of the science of grammar, he has made no mention of its utility.
parasparavisadṛśaṃ ca lakṣaṇam eṣāṃ idānīm upadiśyata eva / tatraiva cāyuktatvam eṣām bāliśapralāpakaplatvaṃ vā parākriyata evety alam atiprasaṅgena //	But the commentators on the Sūtras of Pāṇini have shown the principal utility of grammar and other utilities which follow from it in order to promote the interest of their audience.
na ca hānir apy asti /	Hence, nobody should be taken to task.
yadi nāma ghaṭasya dṛṣṭāntīkṛtasya pratidṛṣṭāntadharmaṃ nityatvam ayam abhyupaiti kim iyat ā śabdānityatvapratijñām avajahāti //	Now, the objectors may put questions, viz., "How has grammar become ancillary to the Vedas? What benefit do the Vedas derive from grammar? But these are very trifling ques tions.
pratijñāsiddhyartha eva sarvavādināṃ prayāsaḥ / anirdiṣṭā ca sā sādhayitum aśakyaiveti na tadvacanam asādhanāṅgavacanam /	The questions like the above ones do not stand to reason since either the Vedas and their ancillary sciences are eternalChastity of a word as a perceptible property or they have been composed by God.
laukikeṣv api ṛṇādānādivivādapadeṣu pratijñāhanim eva mukhyaṃ parājayakāraṇam āhuḥ /	Now, we should prove how Panini, Pingala, Parāśara, etc., are designated as authors of several sciences.
nityatvaṃ hi sāmānyavat ghaṭasyāpi sahate /	They are so called because they have compos- ed them either concisely or elaborately.
pratijñātāṛthapratiṣedhe dharme vikalpāt tadarthanirdeśaḥ pratijñāntaram //5.2.3//	But really speaking, the meaning of the Vedas and its knowledge stand on the same footing with the Vedas.
asarvagatas tu śabda iti no darśanam] iti /	They are either eternal or own their existence to God.
atrāha nedam aprastutapratijñāntarakaraṇam api tu parodbhāvitavyabhicāranirākaraṇaviśeṣotpādanam //	Hence, nobody should be taken to task on this issue. The sources of knowledge which comprise the Vedas and their ancillary sciences within them are counted to be fourteen in number.
siddhaṃ hi viśeṣaṇaṃ bhavati /	911 The sources of knowledge are fourteen in number.
api ca [anityaḥ śabdaḥ cākṣuṣatvāt] ity ubhayāsiddho nāma hetvābhāsaḥ bhavadbhir api śāstre lakṣita eva /	They are as follows: "The four Vedas, six ancillary sciences, Mimāṁsă, the extensive science of logic, the Purăņas and the codes of Law (Dharmasastras) constitute the sources of knowledge.
ko hi nāma śiśur api śabde cākṣuṣatāṃ brūyāt /	Many sophistical arguments have been put forward against the refinement of words.
atha rūpādibhyo 'rthāntarasyānupalabdhiḥ na tarhi guṇavyatiriktaṃ dravyam /	They simply exhibit verbosity but do not stand upon the solid rock of reality.
guṇavyatiriktaṃ ca dravyaṃ ca rūpādivyatiriktasyānupalabdhir iti vyāhatam // atrāha nedaṃ pratijñāhetvor virodhodāharaṇaṃ bhavitum arhati hetor asaṃbhavāt /	The objectors have said before, "Which words fall outside the range of chaste words? What is the refinement of a word ?" In order to avoid all these problems we do not subscribe to the hypothesis that the science of grammar owes its existence to the usages of the authoritative persons.
saṃbhavan hi hetuḥ pratijñāyā viruṇaddhi /	We have already stated that the science of grammar is co-eternal with the Vedas.
saṃbhavann api caivaṃvidhe viṣaye pratijñāvirodhe hetuḥ na dvayīṃ doṣajātim ativartate viruddhatvam asiddhatvaṃ vā /	Though the science of grammar is eternal yet it might have been taken up by an ignorant person in the obscure past and might have been passing through the circle of ignorant persons.
iti tasmān nedam api pratijñāhetuvirodhodāharaṇam iti //	Thus the science of grammar has a little significance.
puruṣabuddhipramādanibandhanahetuprayogas tu tathāvidham apy abhidhānaṃ saṃbhavaty eva //	In order to meet this possible objection we hold that the science of grammar is based upon the usages of the cultured persons as the smṛti literature is based upon the Vedas.
pakṣapratiṣedhe pratijñātāṛthāpanayanaṃ pratijñāsannyāsaḥ //5.2.5//	This literature prescribes such duties as have been enjoined by the Vedas and does never prescribe such ones as have been enjoined by books other than the Vedas.
[anityaḥ śabdaḥ aindriyakatvāt] ity ukte tathaiva sāmānyenānaikāntikatāyām udghāṭitāyāṃ yat pratibravīti [ka evam āhānityaḥ śabda iti so 'yam evaṃ bruvan pratijñāsannyāsāt parājīyate //	The words which have been taught by the science of grammar as chaste ones are seen to be used as such by the cultured persons; just as the teaching of the medical science that a sick person is cured of his malady taking myrobalan is corroborated by the practice of reliable persons.
kṛtsnaṃ vyākaraṇaṃ proktaṃ ācāryo nas sa pāṇiniḥ //	Pâņini has not composed the science of grammar having learnt it from the cultured persona- ges.
api ca acintyaveṣābharaṇasya tattvataḥ yadṛcchayā yasya niśāsu tāṇḍavam / sa bhasmabhaktīni bibharti maulinā kṛtāṃjaliḥ pādarajāṃsi vāsavaḥ //	Caraka has not also composed his medical treatise, havingNyayamanjari ascertained the properties of various substances by means of experimental method since the beginning of the cultured persons i cannot be traced out.
tad etad arthāntaraṃ nigrahasthānam asādhanāṅgam iti //	Thus, the fallacy of a vicious circle is met.
na hy anunmattānām īdṛśyakṣarāṇi mukhān nirgacchanti /	The science of grammar does not originate from the cultured persons.
atrocyate matupā vatinā vā 'bhidheyaśūnyatvamātram atra vivakṣitam / abhidheyaśūnyaṃ vaco nirarthakam ity uktam iti bhavati /	912 The objectors have pointed out many incorrect usages of the cultured persons. They have also referred to a list of unchaste words which have been used by the ancient sages.
saugatadarśane śabdānām arthāsaṃsparśitvāt svalakṣaṇe teṣām apravṛtteḥ /	With regard to these illustrations the expert linguists have shown the line of defence.
apohasya cātitucchatvāt sarvaṃ tad abhidhānaṃ nirathakam //	In order to restrain the unnecessary enlargement of this volume we cut short all these discussions.
kapolavādnādīni punaḥ akathāsvabhāvatvād acintyāny eva /	The objectors have found fault with the definitions of a verb and a non-inflected word and with the rules which govern case- endings etc.
tatra ca kalpyate nūnam asāmarthyam ātmīyam āvarītumanāḥ evam abhidhatte na hi samartho vidvān vispaṣṭaṃ na vaktīti //	Many erudite scholars have reviewed the said criticisms and given a fit reply to them.
anekaprāśnikādisamāje kathitam avaśyaṃ kenāpy avagamyate /	Now, it may be objected that these reviews may be re-examined and so on, ad infinitum.
sarvai anavagamāt tu vaktaiva nigṛhyate /	In other words, no decision will be arrived at.
pūrvāparāsaṅgatapadakadambakoccāraṇād apratiṣṭhitavākyārtham apārthakaṃ nām nigrahasthānaṃ bhavati /	The objection does not hold good, since the path which has been shown by the expert linguists is free from disturbances created by the thieves in the shape of destructive critics.
prakṛtavastusiddhis tu dvāviṃśatāv api tulyaiva //	If we follow the above line of defence then the other objections raised by our critics are also met with.
yat tu asaṃbaddhavākyaṃ aśbaddhaprakaraṇaṃ ca pṛthagupasaṃkhyeyam iti tan na apratisaṃbaddhapadārthenaiva tatsaṃgrahāt /	The said objections are as follows: the treatise of grammar is incomplete since it does not contain a few words such as sobhā, cīrṇa, vareṇya, gaṇeya, bhrājiṣņu, kāndiśika etc.
yogācārāṇāṃ sākāraṃ jñānam eva na bāhyo 'rthaḥ sa ca pratyakṣaḥ /	The science of grammar falls short of the definitions of memory, doubt, illusion.
anyasya cāpy abaddhasya pratiṣṭhā kena labhyate //	etc. These defects have been imagined by some critics.
avayavaviparyāsavacanam aprāptakālam //5.2.11//	These objections have been throughly answered by the grammarians themselves in own works.
atrāha na hi padānāṃ vākyeṣu niyataḥ kramaḥ kaścid asti /	their The Sutra of Brhaspati is no sūtra at all.
na hi ṭagha ity kute ghaṭāvagatir bhavati /	It is not worth considering.
anumānavākye tu ārthaḥ kramaḥ balād āpatati svapratipattyanusāreṇa parapratipatter utpādanād /	He has demonstrated his vain scholarship by advancing a few sophistical arguments which have been manu- factured by his pure imagination.
na veti śaṅkāyām upanayavacanam uccāryate /	We need not enter into the contents of his arguments since they are deliberately misleading.
hetūdāharaṇādhikam adhikam //5.2.13//	In fine, the science of grammar is stainless by its very nature and is clegant.

It is better to be born as mute whales in the miry deep water than to be born as men whose speech is not refined by the study of grammar. Manu, also, has said in his own work that a scholar who is well-versed in the science of grammar and a scholar who is well- up in the Mimāṁså system purify their lineage.
kvāyaṃ vaṭuḥ katipayākṣaraleśaliptajihvānvitaḥ katham anena sahābhidaddhmaḥ //	He says that he who can analyse a word, and he who can correctly in- terpret the Vedic sentences employed in sacrifices, sanctify their lineage.

Those who have closely studied the science of grammar and obtained mastery over refined language may have an easy access to the Vedic words which have diverse forms.
