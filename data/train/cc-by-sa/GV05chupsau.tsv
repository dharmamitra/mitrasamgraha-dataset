tapa eva dvitīyastapa iti kṛcchracāndrāyaṇādi tadvāṃstāpasaḥ parivrāḍvā na brahmasaṃstha āśramadharmamātrasaṃstho;	the Cāndrāyaṇa and other penances; one who keeps all these is the Tāpasa, Ascetic, or the Wandering Mendicant who has merely just reached the final lifestage, but has not yet rested firmly in Brahman;
brahmasaṃsthasya tvamṛtatvaśravaṇāt /	that such is the sense is indicated by the separate mention of ‘one who rests firmly in Brahman

atyantamityādiviśeṣaṇānnaiṣṭhika iti gamyate /	The qualification ‘constantly’ indicates that this stage is represented by the lifelong Religious Student;
upakurvāṇasya svādhyāyagrahaṇārthatvānna puṇyalokatvaṃ brahmacaryeṇa /	as for the ordinary Religious Student, his studentship is for the definite purpose of studying the Veda, and hence such studentship could not take one to the ‘Sacred Regions’
sarva ete trayo 'pyāśramiṇo yathoktairdharmaiḥ puṇyalokā bhavanti /	All these three kinds of personscarrying on the prescribed duties in their respective lifestages of the Householder, the Ascetic and the Lifelong Religious Student attain the Blessed Regions
puṇyo loko yeṣāṃ ta ime puṇyalokā āśramiṇo bhavanti /	The meaning is that the persons carrying on the duties of the lifestages come to be such as enter the Blessed Regions

puṇyalokātpṛyagamṛtatvasya vibhāgakaraṇāt /	that this is so is clearly indicated by the fact that it has been declared to be entirely distinct from the ‘Sacred Regions’
yadi ca pumyalokātiśayamātramamṛtatvamabhaviṣyattataḥ puṇyalokatvādvibhaktaṃ nāvakṣyat /	If ‘Immortality were only a higher degree of Blessed Regions,’ then the Text would not have spoken of it as some thing distinct from the Blessed Regions
vibhaktepadeśāccā'tyantikamamṛtatvamiti gamyate /	Thus, because it has been spoken of as clearly distinguished from the ‘Blessed Regions’, it follows that what is meant is Absolute Immortallity
atra cā'śramadharmaphalopanyāsaḥ praṇavasevāstutyarthaṃ na tatphalavidhyartham / stutaye ca pravamasevāyā āśramadharmaphalavidhaye ceti hi bhidyeta vākyam /	The introduction, in the present context, of the subject of the reward of the fulfilment of the Duties of the Lifestages is meant to eulogise the meditation of the syllable ‘Om’ and it is not meant to mention the rewards that actually follow from the said fulfilment
tasmātsmṛtisiddhāśramaphalānuvādena praṇavasevāphalamamṛtatvaṃ bruvanpraṇavasevāṃ stauti /	Hence the conclusion is that when the text speaks of Immortality as the reward of meditating on ‘Om’, with reference to the duties of the Lifestages already known through ten Smṛtitexts,it only glorifies the meditation of ‘Om’
yathā pūrṇavarmaṇaḥ sevā bhaktaparidhānamātraphalā rājavarmaṇastu sevā rājyatulyaphaleti tadvat /	This is similar to the case of such an assertion as ‘Service under Pūrṇavarman brings only food and clothing, while that under Rājavarman brings rewards equal to kingship’
praṇavaśca tatsatyaṃ paraṃ brahma tatpratīkatvāt / etaddhyevākṣaraṃ brahma etaddhyevākṣaraṃ param ityādyāmnāyātkāṭhake yuktaṃ tatsevāto 'mṛtatvam /	The syllable ‘Om’ really is the ‘true the Highest Brahman, being, as it is, the representative image, name of this latter,as declared in the KathaUpaniṣad‘This syllable indeed is the Brahman, verily this syllable is the Highest’, hence it is only right that Immortality should be the reward of meditating upon it

brahmasaṃsthatve 'pratiṣedhācca / svakarmacchidre ca brahmasaṃsthatāyāṃ sāmardhyopapatteḥ /	and that it is quite within the capacity of all these persons to ‘rest firmly in Brahman’ ie meditate on ‘Om’, which represents Brahman during the intervals of the performance of their duties relating to their respective lifestages;nor is the connotation of the term ‘resting firmly in Brāhman’ rigidly restricted by convention to the Wandering Mendicant only;
na ca yavavarāhādiśabdavadbrahmasaṃsthaśabdaḥ parivrājake rūḍhaḥ /	like such ordinary words as ‘Barley, Boar’ and the like;
brahmaṇi saṃsthitinimittamupādāya pravṛttatvāt /	as its use is based entirely upon the fact of ‘resting in Brahman’ which is what it literally connotes;
na hi rūḍhiśabdā nimittamupādadate /	while words that have their use dependent entirely upon convention do not have their use dependent upon any such connotation of the term, etymologically
sarveṣāṃ ca brahmaṇi sthitirupapadyate /	Then again, it is possible for all men to ‘rest in Brahman’
yatra yatra nimittamasti brahmaṇi saṃsthitistasya tasya nimittavato vācakaṃ santaṃ brahmasaṃsthaśabdaṃ parivrāḍekaviṣaye saṃkoca kāraṇābhāvānniroddhuma	Thus then wherever this basis of the use of the term, ‘resting firmly in Brahman is present,every one such person comes under the connotation of the term ‘firmly resting in Brahman’, and there is no reason for narrowing its connotation to the Wandering Mendicant alone;
yuktam /	and hence it cannot be right to so restrict it
na ca pārivrājyāśramadharmamātreṇāmṛtatvam /	Further, Immortality cannot follow merely from entering into the lifestage of the Wandering Mendicant;
jñānānarthakyaprasaṅgāt / pārivrājyadharmayuktameva jñānamamṛtatvasādhanamiti cenna /	It might be argued that ‘what leads to Immortality is True Knowledge as accompanied by the life of the Wandering MendicantBut that cannot be right;
āśramadharmatvāviśeṣāt /	because the duties relating to the other three lifestages are as important ‘duties’ as those relating to that of the Wandering Mendicant;
dharmo vā jñānaviśiṣṭo 'mṛtatvasādhanamityedapi sarvāśramadharmāṇāmaviśiṣṭam /	hence if Duty coupled with True Knowledge be what brings Immortality, then that also applies equally to the Duties of all the lifestages not to those of the Wandering Mendicant only
na ca vacanamasti parivrājakasyaiva brahmasaṃsthasya mokṣo nānyeṣāmiti /	Nor is there any direct declaration to the effect that Final Liberation comes only to the Wandering Mendicant resting firmly in Brahman, and not to others
jñānānmokṣa iti ca sarvopaniṣadāṃ siddhāntaḥ tasmādya eva brahmasaṃsthaḥ svāśramavihitakarmavatāṃ so 'mṛtatvametīti /	In fact the thesis of all the Upaniṣads is that Final Liberation follows from True Knowledge Hence the meaning of the text must be that, from among persons duly performing the duties of their own lifestages, if any one ‘rests firmly in Brahman’, he attains Immortality
tacca nimittaṃ na śāsrakṛtam /	This interpretation is not right;

na hi taimirikadvicandrādibhedapratyayamanupamṛdya timirāpagame candrādyekatvapratyaya upajāyate /	For instance, until the notion of diversity involved in the perception of ‘two noons’ due to darkness has been removed, there does not appear, even on the disappearance of darkness, the notion of the ‘one Moon’

sa ca nivṛttakarmā brahmasaṃstha ucyate,	and it is only such a person who has thus desisted from all activity who is said to ‘rest firmly in Brahman’;
sa ca parivrāḍevānyasyāsambhavāt /	and such a person can be only the Wandering Mendicant, Renunciate;
anyo hyanivṛttabhedapratyayaḥ so 'nyatpaśyañśṛṇvanmanvāno vijānannidaṃ kṛtvedaṃ prāpnuyāmiti hi manyate /	Another person, whose notions of diversity have not ceased, always sees, hears, thinks of and cognises things as different from himself and diverse, and always thinks in such terms as ‘Having done this act, shall acquire such and such a thing’;
tasyaivaṃ kurvato na brahmasaṃsthatā /	and certainly one who thinks thus cannot be said to ‘rest firmly in Brahman’;
vācārambhaṇamātravikārānṛtābhisandhipratyayatvāt /	because his ideas are all false and wrong as pertaining to unrealities which owe their existence to mere modifications of speech
na cāsatyamityupardite bhedapratyaye satyamidamanena kartavyaṃ mayeti pramāṇaprameyabuddhirupapadyate / ākāśa iva talamalabuddhirvivekinaḥ /	When the notion of diversity has been set aside as false, there is no possibility of any such notions of means and objects of cognition as are involved in ideas like ‘this is true’, ‘this should be done by him’ or ‘by me jtst as for a man who is wise and knows the real nature of the’sky, there is no possibility of the idea that ‘the sky is dirty’
upamardite 'pi bhedapratyaye karmabhyo na nivartate cetprāgiva bhedapratyayopamardanādekatvapratyayavidhāyakaṃ vākyamapramāṇīkṛtaṃ syāt /	If, even on the setting aside of the notion of diversity, a man were not to desist from Action and were to continue to act just as before the setting aside of the notions of diversitythen the text laying down the idea of Unity would become falsified;

prāmāṇyacintāyāṃ puruṣapravṛtteradṛṣṭāntatvāt /	because when we are considering the validity of certain sources of knowledge, the citing of an instance of human activity cannot prove anything
na hi nābhicarediti pratiṣiddhamapyabhicaramaṃ kaścitkurvandṛṣṭa iti śatrau dveṣarahitenāpi vivekinābhicaraṇaṃ kriyate /	For example, though the act of killing has been prohibited by the text ‘One should not encompass the death of any man’,the mere fact of some one having been found to have done the Killing does not lead the wise man who has no hatred for any body to do the act of killing merely on the strength of the example of the man who has been found to have done the killing
na ca karmavidhipravṛttinimitte bhedapratyaye bādhite 'gnihotrādau pravartakaṃ nimittamasti, parivrājakasyeva bhikṣācaraṇādau bubhukṣādi pravartakam /	In fact, when the notion of diversity which is the very basis of the injunction of actions, has been set aside for the wise man, there is nothing to urge the man to the performance of the Agnihotra and such acts;in the case of the Renunciate begging for food, the necessary urge comes from hunger and such other bodily needs
ihāpyakaraṇe pratyavāyabhayaṃ pravartakamiti cet / na /	In the case of the Agnihotra also, there would be the urge coming from the fear of sin involved in the nonperformance of a prescribed act Nor so, we reply

bhedapratyayavānanupamarditabhedabuddhirvidyayā yaḥ sa karmaṇyadhikṛta ityavocāma /	we have already explained that only such persons are entitled to the performance of Actions as are still tied to the notions of diversity, which notions they have not yet got rid of;
yo hyadhikṛtaḥ karmaṇi tasya tadakarame pratyavāyo na nivṛttādhikārasya gṛhasthasyeva brahmacāriṇo viśeṣadharmānanuṣṭhāne /	and it is only when a man is entitled to the performance of an act that its nonperformance by him entails sin, and not when the man has ceased to be so entitled; for example, the Householder does not incur sin by the nonperformance of the duties laid down specifically for the Religious Student
evaṃ tarhi sarvaḥ svāśramastha utpannekatvapratyayaḥ parivrāḍiti cet / na / svasvāmitvabhedabuddhyanivṛtteḥ /	If that be so, then each and every man, in his own particular lifestage, could be a Renunciate as soon as the notion of Unity would dawn upon him Certainly not;
karmārthatvāccetarāśramāṇām / atha karma kurvīyaiti śruteḥ / tasmātsvasvāmitvābhāvādbhikṣureka eva parivrāṭ /	and that it so persists is indicated by the very nature of those lifestages, which are meant for the performance of acts, as is clear from such Vedic texts as‘May we perform acts’ and the like

na ca pratiṣiddhasevāprāptiḥ /	prescribed for him Not so, we reply
ekatvapratyayotpatteḥ prāgeva pratiṣiddhatvāt /	because the prohibition relates to the man before he has realised Unity
na hi rātrau kūpe kaṇṭake vā patita udite 'pi savitari patati tasminneva /	Because a man has fallen into the well, or in a thornthicket at night,it does not follow that he should fall in it even after sunrise
tasmātsiddhaṃ nivṛttakarmā bhikṣuka eva brahmasaṃstha iti /	From all this it follows that the only person who can be regarded as ‘resting in Brahman’ is the Renunciate, the Wandering Mendicant, who has turned his back upon all Actions
yatpunaruktaṃ sarveṣāṃ jñānavarjitānāṃ puṇyalokateti / satyametat /	It has been argued by the Vṛttikāra that the blessed regions are for all persons, even those who are devoid of True Knowledge;this is quite true;
yaccoktaṃ tapaḥśabdena parivrāḍapyukta iti /	but it is not true that the term Austerity includes the Wandering Mendicant also
kasmāt / parivrājakasyaiva brahmasaṃsthatāsambhavāt / sa eva hyavaśeṣita ityavocāma /	WhyBecause the character of ‘resting in Brahman’ can belong to the Wandering Mendicant only, as it is he alone who remains unmentioned in the text so far;
ekatvavijñānavato 'gnihotrādivattaponivṛtteśca / bhedabuddhimata eva hi tapaḥkartavyatā syāt /	Another reason for this lies in the fact that, for the man who has attained the Knowledge of Unity, Austerity also ceases; just like Agnihotra and other acts
etena karmacchidre brahmasaṃsthatāsāmarthyaṃ apratiṣedhaśca pratyuktaḥ / tathā jñānavāneva nivṛttakarmā parivrāḍiti jñānavaiyarthyaṃ pratyuktam /	This same reasoning also serves to set aside the views that a the resting in Brahman may appear during the intervals of ritualistic performance, and b that there is no exclusion by any Vedic Text of the possibility of resting in Brahman for persons other than Wandering Mendicants Our view is that it is only when the man has attained True Knowledge that, on desisting from all activity, he can become a Wandering Mendicant;and this disposes of the argument urged against us that under our view the acquiring of knowledge becomes entirely futile
yatpunaruktaṃ yavavarāhādiśabdavatparivrājake na rūḍho brahmasaṃsthaśabda iti tatparihṛtam / tasyaiva brahmasaṃsthatāsambhavānnānyasyeti /	Then again, it has been argued that like the terms ‘barley’ find ‘boar’, the term ‘resting in Brahman’ has not got its connotation restricted by convention, to the Wandering Mendicant onlyThis has been already answered by us, by proving that the character of ‘resting in Brahman’ can possibly belong only to the Wandering Mendicant, not to any one else
yatpunaruktaṃ rūḍhaśabdā nimittaṃ nopādadata iti /	It has been argued that words whose connotation is fixed by convention do not depend upon any other considerations as those of etymology and the like

na yatra yatra tāni nimittāni tatra tatra vartante /	But it does not follow from this that those terms are applicable anywhere and everywhere where the said conditions may be present ;
prasiddhyabhāvāt /	because such is not the recognised connotation of the terms
tathehāpi brahmasaṃsthaśabdo nivṛttasarvakarmatatsādhanaparivrāḍekaviṣaye 'tyāśramiṇi paramahaṃsākhye vṛtta iha bhavitumarhati /	Similarly in the case in question also, the term ‘resting in Brahman’ can, in the present context, have its connotation restricted to the person who has desisted from all actions and their agencies and has become a Wandering Mendicant, ie the Renunciate who has entered upon the final lifestage, and is technically called ‘Paramahaṃsa’
mukhyāmṛtatvaphalaśravaṇāt /	That this is so is indicated by the mention of the principal reward of Immortality accruing as to him
ataścedamevaikaṃ vedoktaṃ pārivrājyam / na yajñopavītatridaṇḍakamaṇḍalvādiparigraha iti /	From all this it follows that it is this ‘WanderingMendicancy’ that is meant by the Veda as leading to Immortality, and not that in which people take to the Sacrificial Thread, the TripleStick, the WaterPot and the rest;
muṇḍo 'parigraho 'saṅgaiti śrutiḥatyākṣamibyaḥ paramaṃ pavitram ityādi ca śvetāśvatarīye / niḥstutirnirnamaskāraityādismṛtibhyaśca /	that this is so is also shown by such Vedic texts as With shaven head, with no belongings and no attachment etc To the same end there are such Vedic Texts as the following in the ŚvetāśvataraUpaniṣad ‘The Highest sacred place is for those who are above the ordinary lifestages,’and in such Smṛti Texts as ‘Without praise, without obeisances, etc’;
tasmātkarma na kurvanti yatayaḥ pāradarśinaḥ / tasmādaliṅgo dharmajño 'vyaktaliṅgaityādismṛtibhyaśca /	so also in such SmṛtiTexts as‘It is for this reason that Renunciates, seeing through the end of things, do not perform actions’‘Hence one knowing Dharma, should be without differentiating marks, or with unobtrusive marks’, etc, etc,
yattu sāṃkhyaiḥ karmatyāgo 'bhyupagamyate / kriyākārakaphalabhedabuddheḥ satyatvābhyupagamāt tanmṛṣā /	The ‘renunciation of Action’ which is propounded by the Sāṅkhyas is wrong inasmuch as they admit the reality of such distinctions as between ‘Action’, ‘Active Agency’ and ‘Results’
yacca bauddhaiḥ śūnyatābhyupagamādakartṛtvamabhyupagamyate / tadapyasat /	Similarly, the theory of ‘Void’ Nihilism propounded by the Bauddhas, and the consequent denial of the ‘Active Agent’, as the performer of Actionare not right;
tadabhyupagantuḥ sattvābhyupagamāt /	as they admit the reality of the person who holds the said theory
yaccājñairalasatayākartṛtvābhyupagamaḥ so 'pyasan,	This also is not right, because for such people the notion of the ‘Active Agent has not been set aside by any valid source of knowledge
kārakabuddheranivartatatvātpramāṇena / tasmādvedāntapramāṇajanitaikatvapratyayavata eva karmanivṛttilakṣaṇaṃ pārivrājyaṃ brahmasaṃsthatvaṃ ceti siddham /	From all this it follows that it is only when on the strength of the Vedantic Texts, one has reached firm conviction regarding Unity, that he reaches the real ‘Renunciation of Action’ which constitutes the stage of the Wandering Mendicant and that of ‘Resting in Brahaman ’
etena gṛhasthasyaikatvavijñāne sati pārivrājyamarthasiddham / nanvagnyutsādanadoṣabhāksyātparivrajan /	From this also it follows that if, in a certain case, a Householder has attained the knowledge of unity and thereby set aside all notions of diversity he also naturally attains the position of the Wandering Mendicant
vīrahā vā eṣa devānāṃ yo 'gnimudvāsayateiti śruteḥ / na /	ObjectionSuch a Householder, taking to the life of the Wandering Mendicant, would incur the sin of destroying his Fires,as declared in the Smṛti textsOne who destroys his fires becomes the murderer of the bravest among deities
vedenaivotsāditatvāt utsanna eva hi sa ekatvadarśane jāte /	in fact, the fire becomes destroyed by itself as soon as the conviction of Unity is realised;
apāgādagneragnitvamiti śruteḥ / ato na doṣabhāggṛhasthaḥ parivrajanniti //	as declared in the Śruti Texts‘The fireness of the fire has disappeared etc, etc’Hence by taking to the life of the Wandering Mendicant, the Householder does not incur any sin

That is to say, in no way could he ever become a sacrificer, The purpose of all this is to eulogise the knowledge of Sāma and the sacrificial details, and it does not mean that the performance of the sacrifice is forbidden for one who knows merely the sacrificial ritual and is ignorant of the aforesaid Sāma and the rest

brahmaṇaḥ sarvaviśeṣarahitasya neti netītyādiśiṣapratiṣedhagamyasya durbodhatvāt / satsvanekeṣu cchandaḥsu gāyatryā eva brahmajñānadvāratayopādānaṃ prādhānyāt /	and this science is expounded through the Gāyatrī, because directly by itself Brahman is hard to comprehend, being, as it is, devoid of differentiating qualifications, and comprehensible only through such negation of qualifications as contained in the Vedic text ‘Not this, not that’
somāharaṇāt itaracchandokṣarāharaṇenetaracchandovyāptyā ca sarvasavanavyāpakatvācca yajñe prādhānyaṃ gāyatryāḥ /	and this importance of the Gāyatrī at the sacrificial performance is proved by a the fact that it was the Gāyatrī that carried the Soma to the deities, b the fact that it has absorbed the syllabus of all other metres and as such pervades over them all, and c the fact that it pervades over all ‘extractions’

ataḥ pṛthivīvadbhūtaśabdavācyaprāṇapratiṣṭhānāccharīraṃ gāyatrī / etadeva yasmāccharīraṃ nātiśīyante prāṇāḥ //	Thus, inasmuch as, like the Earth, the Body is the resting place of Vital Airs called by the name ‘Beings’,the Body is the Gāyatrī also, because these Vital Airs do not go beyond this Body
yad vai tat puruṣe śarīram idaṃ vāva tad yad idam asminn antaḥ puruṣe hṛdayam /	That which is the Body in Man is that which is the Heart within the Man

śrutiprāmāṇyāt / tathārcirādinā dhūmādinā ca gamanaṃ svapta ivodbhūtavijñānena /	This statement is based upon the authority of the Veda For instance, the passing through Light and through Smoke is always accompanied by consciousness as in a dream in both cases, the consciousness being due to tendencies and impressions left by past deeds
labdhavṛttikarmanimittatvādgamanasya /	That this is so is due to the fact that the said passing through Light and Smoke is the direct result of such Kārmic Residues as have become operative and begun to operate
na tathānuśayināṃ vrīhyādibhāvena jātānāṃ savijñānameva retaḥsigyoṣiddehasambandha upapadyate /	In the case of those, however, who pass on with their Kārmic Residue clinging to them and who are born as Rice, Barley, etc, it is not possible for these to be conscious of their connection with the procreating agents,the woman and the seedsower;
na hi vrīhyādilavanakaṇḍanapeṣaṇādau ca savijñānānāṃ sthitirasti /	it is not possible for conscious beings to be living in the rice etc, while they go through the process of being cut, thumped, ground down and so forth
nanu candramaṇḍalādapyavarohatāṃ dehāntaragamanasya tulyatvājjalūkāvatsavijñānataiva yuktā /	ObjectionIn the other case also, where the entities descend from the Lunar Region, the entering into another body is exactly like such entering in the case of those who have not reached the Lunar Region; so that in the former case also the leechlike moving out from one body to another must be accompanied by consciousness
tathā sati ghoro narakānubhava iṣṭāpūrtādikāriṇāṃ candramaṇḍalādārabhya prāpto yāvadbrāhmaṇādijanma / tathā ca satyanarthāyaiveṣṭāpūrtādyupāsanaṃ vihitaṃ syāt /	And if that be so, then for performers of sacrifices and works of public utility there would be terrible experiences of hell involved throughout the process of descending from the Lunar Region and being ultimately born as Brāhmaṇa etc, as during all this process, the entity would, ex hypothesi, be fully conscious;and this being so, it would come to this, that the injunction of sacrifices and works of public utility really tend to evil consequences;
śruteścāprāmāṇyaṃ prāptaṃ vaidikānāṃ karmaṇāmanarthānubandhitvāt /	and this would shake the authority of the Veda, for the simple reason that acts enjoined in the Veda lead to evil consequences
na, vṛkṣārohaṇapatanavadviśeṣasambhavāt /	AnswerIt is not so Because there is a difference between the two cases, just as there is between going up the tree and falling down from it
dehāddehāntaraṃ pratipitsoḥ karmaṇo labdhavṛttitvākarmaṇodbhāvitena vijñānena savijñānatvaṃ yuktam / vṛkṣāgramārohata iva phalaṃ jighṛkṣoḥ /	It is right that when the entity is passing from one body to the other, he should remain conscious, with the consciousness brought about by that Kārmic Residue which has become operative;just as when one is going up a tree for the purpose of plucking its fruit he is fully conscious;
tathārcirādinā gacchatāṃ savijñānatvaṃ bhavet / dhūmādinā ca candramaṇḍalamārurukṣatām /	it is on this analogy that consciousness would be present in the entities passing through Light and Smoke, while desirous of reaching the Lunar Region
na tathā candramaṇḍalādavarurukṣatāṃ vṛkṣāgrādiva patatāṃ sacetanatvam /	There would be no such consciousness in the case of the entity descending from the Lunar Region; just as there is no consciousness in the man falling down from the tree

tathā lavanakaṇḍanapeṣaṇasaṃskārabhakṣaṇarasādipariṇāmaretaḥsekakāleṣu mūrchitavadeva /	Thus throughout the time taken by the processes of cutting, thumping, grinding, cooking, eating, digesting, turning into juices, and the first ‘sowing of the seed;the entity remains as if unconscious;

antarāle tvavijñānaṃ mūrchitavadevetyadoṣaḥ /	and such momentary consciousness would not be incompatible with our view, though during the whole of the intervening process, they remain unconscious
na ca vaidikānāṃ karmaṇāṃ hiṃsāyuktatvenobhayahetutvaṃ śakyamanumātum /	Nor is it right to argue that the rites prescribed in the Veda being attended with violence and injury, must be the cause of both merit and demerit
hiṃsāyāḥ śāstracoditatvāt /	Because the said violence has been actually enjoined by the scriptures;
ahiṃsansarvabhūtānyanyatra tīrthebhyaḥiti śruteḥ śāstracoditāyā hiṃsāyā nādharmahetutvamabhyupagamyate /	clearly indicates the view that there is no justification for the view that the violence killing enjoined by the scriptures is conducive to Demerit evil
abhyupagate 'pyadharmahetutve mantrairviṣādivattadapanayopapatterna duḥkhakāryārambhakatvopapattirvaidikānāṃ karmaṇāṃ mantreṇeva viṣabhakṣaṇasyeti	Even if such a view were accepted, that the killing involved in the enjoined acts is conducive to evil, such evil could be removed by means of Mantras, just as poisons are removed; consequently, there is no possibility of acts prescribed in the Veda bringing about effects productive of pain, just as the effects of taking poison are rendered ineffective by Mantras

tattvamasītyanena vākyena pratibuddhasya nivartate / virodhāt /	that the said notions are set aside by this last assertion follows from the fact that the two are mutually contradictory so that if the latter is true, the former must be false

nanu tattvamasītyatra tvaṃśabdavācyer'the sadbuddhirādhitsyate yathā'dityamana ādiṣu brahmādibuddhiḥ /	ObjectionWhat is done in the assertion ‘That thou art’ is that the idea of ‘Being’ is attributed to what is denoted by the term ‘thou’ just as this idea of Brahman and other Deities is attributed to the Sun, the Mind and other things,or as in the ordinary world, the idea of
yathā ca loke pratimādiṣu viṣṇvādibuddhistadvannatu sadeva tvamiti,	Viṣṇu and other Deities attributed to the Images;

ādityo brahmetyādāvitiśabdavyavadhānānna sākṣādbrahmatvaṃ gamyate /	In such passages as the Sun is as Brahman’ should be looked or meditated upon as Brahman, the intervention of the term ‘as’ makes it impossible for it to provide the idea that ‘the Sun is actually Brahman itself’;

nanu parākramādiguṇaḥ siṃho 'si tvamitivattattvamasīti syāt / na /	ObjectionThe assertion ‘that thou art’ may be a figurative one, just as a man endowed with courage and other qualities is spoken as ‘you are a lion’
mṛdādivatsadekamevādvitīyaṃ satyamityupadeśāt /	because it has been taught that Being, one, without a second, is the only real Entitylike ‘clay’ being the one entity pervading all products of clay
na copacāravijñānāttasya tāvadeva ciramiti satsampattirūpadiśyeta / mṛṣātvādupacāravijñānasya /	If it were a more figurative expression, the knowledge thereof could not be spoken of as bringing about that mergence into Being where ‘the delay is only so long’ etc, because all figurative notions are false unreal
tvamindro 'si yama itivat /	just like the notions ‘you are Indra’, ‘you are Yama’
nāpi stutiranupāsyatvācchvetaketoḥ / nāpi sacchvetaketutvopadeśena stūyeta /	Nor can the figurative expression be regarded as an eulogy, because Śvetaketu is not a person to be worshipped hence eulogised;

nanu sadasmītibuddhimātramiha kartavyatayā codyate na tvajñātaṃ sadasīti jñāpyata iti cet /	OpponentAll that is taught here is that one should cultivate the notion that ‘ am Being’, and it does not make known, by saying ‘thou art Being anything that is not already known
nanvasminpakṣe 'pyaśrutaṃ śrutaṃ bhavatītyādyanupapannam /	‘But, even under this view, it would not be possible that the unheard becomes heard etc’Not so;
na, sadasmītibuddhividheḥ stutyarthatvāt /	because in reality the idea that ‘ am Being’ is meant to be an eulogy
na, ācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciramityupadeśāt /	This cannot be right; because it has been taught that ‘the man with a teacher knows;

tasya tāvadeva ciramiti ca kṣepakaraṇaṃ na yuktaṃ syāt /	Further, in that case there would be no point in asserting any such interval as is mentioned in the phrase ‘for him the delay is only so long etc, etc’
sadātmatattve 'vijñāte 'pi sakṛdbuddhimātrakaraṇe mokṣaprasaṅgāt /	Lastly, under this interpretation that even without the realisation of one’s having his self in Being, if one only formed the said idea only once, he would at once attain liberation as he would have fulfilled the injunctions of cultivating the said notion
na ca tattvamasītyukte nāhaṃ saditipramāṇavākyajanitā buddhīrnivartayituṃ śakyā notpanneti vā śakyaṃ vaktum /	Further, where it has been declared that ‘That thou art’, and its full signification understood as meaning that ‘ am Being’this notion cannot be rejected as being asserted by an unauthoritative assertion, or as not brought about by all by any means of cognition
sarvopaniṣadvākyānāṃ tatparatayaivopakṣayāt /	Because as a matter of fact, all Upaniṣadic texts point to the same conclusion that ‘ am Being’
yathāgnihotrādividhijanitāgnihotrādikartavyatābuddhīnāmatathārthatvamanutpannatvaṃ vā na śakyate vaktuṃ tadvat /	in the case of this injunction, it cannot be denied that it lays down the performance of the Agnihotra and other rites, nor can it be denied that this notion is not brought about by that injunction
yattūktaṃ sadātmā sannātmānaṃ kathaṃ na jānīyāditi / nāsau doṣaḥ /	It has been argued that‘If one has his Self in Being, how is it that he does not know himself?’But this does not vitiate our position

In fact, if they had realised this difference of their selves from the body how could they have the idea of being the actor and enjoyer? and yet this idea is found to be present
tadvattasyāpi dehādiṣvātmabuddhitvānna syātsadātmavijñānam /	In the same manner, so long as this man regards the body as the Self, they cannot realise the idea that they have their Self in Being
tasmādvikārānṛtādhikṛtajīvātmavijñānanivartakamevedaṃ vākyaṃ tattvamasīti siddhamiti //	From all this it follows that what the sentence ‘That thou art’ does is to set aside the idea of ‘Self’ in regard to that ‘Living Ego’ which is a product, unreal and entitled to the performance of acts
