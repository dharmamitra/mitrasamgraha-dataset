atha devānām patnīryajati /	He then makes offering to the wives of the gods.
patnīṣu vai yonau retaḥ pratiṣṭhitaṃ tattataḥ prajāyate tatpatnīṣvaivaitadyonau retaḥ siktam pratiṣṭhāpayati tattataḥ prajāyate tasmāddevānām patnīryajati //	In the wives, in the womb, the seed assuredly is planted, and thence it is produced; hence he thereby plants the seed in the wives, in the womb; and thence it is produced: for this reason he makes offering to the wives of the gods.

He thereby conceals (this offering) from them; and accordingly Yâgñavalkya says, 'Whenever human women here eat (they do so) apart from men.'
athāgniṃ gṛhapatiṃ yajati /	He then makes offering to Agni, the householder.
ayaṃ vā agnirloka imamevaitallokamimāḥ prajā abhiprajanayati tā imaṃ lokamimāḥ prajā abhiprajāyante tasmādagniṃ gṛhapatiṃ yajati //	Agni, indeed, is this world: hence it is for this world that he thereby produces offspring and that this offspring is produced: this is why he makes offering to Agni, the householder.

For on that occasion when he wishes the sacrificer good-speed (svagâ) by (offering) the prastara, good-speed is at the same time wished to his consort also, since the wife comes (immediately) after the husband. But were he to use a substitute for the prastara-bunch, he would produce lassitude (in the wife): for this reason this (ceremony) should conclude with the idâ.
sa yadi prastarasya rūpaṃ kuryāt /	Nevertheless a substitute for the prastara is (optionally) made.
yathaivādaḥ prastareṇa yajamānaṃ svagākarotyevamevaitatpatnīṃ svagākaroti //	If he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he thereby wishes the wife good-speed just ashe wishes the sacrificer good-speed by means of the prastara.
sa yadi prastarasya rūpaṃ kuryāt / vedasyaikaṃ tṛṇamācidyāgraṃ juhvāmanakti madhyaṃ sruve budhnaṃ sthālyām //	If he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he plucks out one stalk from the veda, and anoints its top in the guhû, its middle part in the aruva, and its lower end in the butter-pan.

[The Adhvaryu] having thrown it silently after (the prastara into the fire), touches himself, with the text , 'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni, guard mine eye!' and in this way he avoids throwing himself after (the prastara into the fire).
athāha saṃvadasveti / agānagnīdagaṃcrāvaya auṣaṭ svagā daivyā hotṛbhyaḥ svastirmānuṣebhyaḥ śaṃyorbrūhīti //	"He (the Âgnîdhra) then says (to the Adhvaryu), 'Discourse together!' (The Adhvaryu says), 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnîdh?' 'He has gone!' 'Bid (the gods) hear!' 'May (one or they) hear!' 'Good-speed to the divine Hotris! Success to the human!' [Then the Adhvaryu to the Hotri], 'Pronounce the ""All-hail and blessing!""'"
atha juhūṃ ca sruvaṃ ca sampragṛhṇāti /	Thereupon he (the Adhvaryu) seizes at the same time the guhû and sruva.
ado haivāhutiṃ karoti yadanaktyāhutirbhūtvā devalokaṃ gacāditi tasmājjuhūṃ ca sruvaṃ ca sampragṛhṇāti //	On the former occasion indeed, by anointing (the prastara), hemade (the sacrificer) an oblation, thus thinking, 'May he go to the world of the gods as an oblation!' For this reason he now seizes the guhû and sruva at the same time.

Vât!' since one offers what has been consecrated by vashat,' this (residue of butter) thereby becomes such for him.
atha vedam patnī visraṃsayati /	The mistress then unties the veda-bunch.

For union the veda was made: and accordingly when he touches, (the altar) with it during the sacrifice, a union productive of offspring is thereby effected.
yoṣā vai patnī vṛṣā vedo mithunamevaitatprajananaṃ kriyate tasmādvedaṃ patnī visraṃsayati //	And (the reason) why it is the mistress who unties the veda (is this): the mistress is female and the veda is male; consequently a union productive of offspring is thereby effected: this is why the mistress unties the veda.
sā visraṃsayati /	She unties it.

Were he to perform the samishtayagus-oblation first and then the patnîsamyâgas, that sacrifice of his would be completed in the west (behind the sacrificer) : hence he makesthe samishtayagus-oblation at this particular time, thinking, 'In the east my sacrifice shall be completed!'

These same (deities) he thereby dismisses in due form; and whatever be the practice in their case in accordance with that he has, in thus performing it, produced the sacrifice, and having thus produced it he now establishes it safely where there is a safe basis for it: this is why he performs the samishtayagus.

Having accordingly prepared this (special) sacrifice, he thereby establishes it safely in that (chief, full or new-moon) sacrifice, and thus unites sacrifice with sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'Svâhâ! give (it) to the wind!'
atha barhirjuhoti / ayaṃ vai loko barhiroṣadhayo barhirasminnevaitalloka oṣadhīrdadhati tā imā asmiṃloka oṣadhayaḥ pratiṣṭhitāstasmādbarhirjuhoti //	He then offers up the barhis, The barhis, truly, is this world, and the barhis (consists of) plants: hence he thereby bestows plants on this world, and these plants are safely established in this world: for this reason he offers up the barhis.
samiṣṭayajurhyevānto yajñasya yaddhyūrdhvaṃ samiṣṭayajuṣo 'tiriktaṃ tadyadā hi samiṣṭayajurjuhotyathaitābhyo juhoti tasmādimā atiriktā asammitā oṣadhayaḥ prajāyante // sa juhoti /	This offering he makes as an additional one, since the samishtayagus is the end of the sacrifice, and consequently what comes after the samishtayagus is additional; and because, in performing the samishtayagus, he offers to those (deities ), and thence additional unlimited plants are here produced.
sam barhiraṅktāṃ haviṣā ghṛtena samādityairva/ subhiḥ sam marudbhiḥ samindro viśvadevebhiraṅktāṃ divyaṃ nabho gacatu yatsvāheti //	"He offers it, with the text , 'May the barhis combine with the sacrificial food, with the butter! May Indra combine with the Âdityas, the Vasus, the Maruts, and the Visve Devâh! May what (has been offered with) ""Svâhâ"" go up to the heavenly ether !'"
atha praṇītā dakṣiṇataḥ parītya ninayati /	Having thereupon walked round (from thenorth side of the Âhavanîya fire) to the south, he pours the pranîtâ-water out (on the altar).

But were he not to pour out (the pranîtâ-water), the sacrifice, being unyoked, would, in moving backward, injure the sacrificer. In this way, however, the sacrifice does not injure the sacrificer; and for this reason he pours out the pranîtâ-water, after walking round to the south.

He unyokes thee! For whom does he unyoke thee? For him he unyokes thee! For plenty!' He thereby announces to the sacrificer the highest prosperity. He pours it out with the same (vessel) with which he brings it forward; for wherewith they yoke the team, therewith they also unyoke it; with the yoke-tie they yoke it, and with the yoke-tie they unyoke it. By means of a potsherd he now throws the refuse from the cleaning of the rice right under the black antelope skin; with the text , 'The Rakshas' share art thou!'
devāśca vā asurāśca / ubhaye prājāpatyāḥ paspṛdhira etasminyajñe prajāpatau pitari saṃvatsare 'smākamayam bhaviṣyatyasmākamayam bhaviṣyatīti //	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending about this sacrifice, (that is, their) father Pragâpati, the year. 'Ours it (he) shall be! ours it shall be,' they said.

'May they be duly dispossessed of the sacrifice,' they thought for he indeed is duly dispossessed, who is dispossessed even while obtaining a (worthless) share. He, on the other hand, who is dispossessed without any share whatever, hopes for a while, and when it occurs to him, he says, 'What share hast thou given me?' Hence what share the gods set apart for those (Asuras), that same share he now makes over to them in pouring (the refuse of the rice) right under the black antelope skin. He thereby casts it into blind darkness, where there is no (sacrificial) fire.

That sacrifice of his then goes forth towards the world of the gods: after it follows the fee which he gives (to the priests), and holding on to the priests' fee (follows) the sacrificer.
sa eṣa devayāno vā pitṛyāṇo vā panthāḥ /	That same path leads either to the gods or to the fathers .

Now, water is (a means of) lustration: hence he thereby lustrates that path.
pūrṇaṃ ninayati sarvaṃ vai pūrṇaṃ sarveṇaivainametacamayati saṃtatamavyavacinnaṃ ninayati saṃtatenaivainametadavyavacinnena ṣamayati //	A full (vessel) he pours out, because full means all: hence he thereby lustrates that (path) by means of the All. He pours it out continuously, uninterruptedly: hence he thereby lustrates that (path) in a continuous, uninterrupted manner.
yadvai yajñasya mithyā kriyate vyasya tadvṛhanti kṣaṇvanti śāntirāpastadadbhiḥ śāntyā śamayati tadadbhiḥ saṃdadhāti // pūrṇaṃ ninayati /	And again why he pours out a vessel (of water) is: where anything is done wrongly at the sacrifice, there they tear or wound it; and--water being (a means of) lustration--he lustrates it by that (means of) lustration, water; he heals it with water.
sarvaṃ vai pūrṇaṃ sarveṇaivaitatsaṃdadhāti saṃtatamavyavacinnaṃ ninayati saṃtatenaivaitadavyavacinnena saṃdadhāti //	A full (vessel) he pours out, because full means all: hence he thereby heals it by means of the All. Continuously, uninterruptedly he pours it out: hence he thereby heals it in a continuous (lasting), uninterrupted manner.

May Tvashtri, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and make even what was injured in our body!' What was torn, that he thereby heals.
atha mukhamupaspṛśate /	He then touches his face (with the water in his hands).
dvayaṃ tadyasmānmukhamupaspṛśate 'mṛtaṃ vā āpo 'mṛtenaivaitatsaṃspṛśata etadu caivaitatkarmātmaṅkurute tasmānmukhamupaspṛśate //	The reason why he thus touches his face is twofold: water means ambrosia, and with ambrosia he accordingly touches himself; also he thereby transfers to himself that sacred work (the sacrifice): for these reasons he touches his face.
atha viṣṇukramān kramate /	He now strides the (three) Vishnu-strides.

In gratifying the gods by that sacrifice--partly by riks, partly by yagus, partly by oblations--he acquires a share among them; and having acquired a share among them, he goes to them.

By his first step he gained this same (earth), by the second this aërial expanse, and by his last (step) the sky. And this same pervading power Vishnu, as the sacrifice, obtains by his strides for him (the sacrificer): for this reason he stridesthe Vishnu-strides.

'In the air Vishnu strode by means of the trishtubh metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!' 'In the sky Vishnu strode by means of the gagatî metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!' When one has thus ascended these worlds, that is the goal, that the safe refuge: the rays of him (the sun) who burns there, are the righteous (departed) ; and what highest light there is , that is Pragâpati or the heavenly world. Having then in this way ascended these worlds, he reaches that goal, that safe refuge. Now he who wishes to give instructions from hence, should come hitherwards from above.

And in like manner he (the priest) also by the escape (of the enemies) gains first the sky, and then this aërial expanse; and thereupon he drives his enemies away from this (earth), whence there is no escape. This earth indeed is a firm footing: hence he thereby stands firm on this firm footing.

'In the air Vishnu strode by means of the trishtubh metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!' 'On the earth Vishnu strode by means of the gâyatrî metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!'--With the texts , '(Excluded) from this food! from this resort!' (pratishthâ, he looks down upon his portion and the altar respectively.) For on this (earth) all this food is safely established (pratishthita): for this reason he says, 'From this food! from this resort!'
atha prāṅ prekṣate /	He then looks towards the east.

The sun is indeed the best ray of light , and therefore he says, 'Self-existent art thou, the best ray of light.' '""Light-bestowing art thou: give me light (varkas)!"" so say I,' said Yâgñavalkya, 'for at this indeed the Brâhmana should strive, that he be brahmavarkasin (illumed by the brahma, or sacred writ).' Aupoditeya , on the other hand, said, 'He indeed will give me cows : (therefore I say), ""Cow-giving art thou, give me cows!""' Thus whatever wish he (the sacrificer) entertains (and expresses), that wish is granted to him."
athāvartate / sūryasyāvṛtamanavāvarta iti tadetāṃ gatimetām pratiṣṭhāṃ gatvaitasyaivāvṛtamanvāvartate //	He then turns (from left to right), with the text , 'I move along the course ofthe sun;' having reached that final goal, that safe resort, he now moves along the course of that (sun) .

And, besides, what full measure of human life there is for him here, that he thereby attains (upa-sthâ). This is why he steps to the Gârhapatya fire.

Mayest thou, O Agni, become a good householder through me, the householder!' there is nothing in this requiring explanation.--'May our household matters be unlike a cart with only one bullock,' he thereby says, 'may our household matters be free from calamities;'--'for a hundred winters!' he thereby says, 'may I live a hundred years.' He need not, however, say this; for man lives even longer than a hundred years: hence he need not say this.
athāvartate / sūryasyāvṛtamanvāvarta iti tadetāṃ gatimetām pratiṣṭhāṃ gatvaitasyaivāvṛtamanvāvartate //	He then turns (from left to right), with the text , 'I move along the course of the sun:' having reached that final goal, that safe resort, he now moves along the course of that (sun).
atha putrasya nāma gṛhṇāti / idam me 'yaṃ vīryam putro 'nusaṃtanavaditi yadi putro na syādapyātmana eva nāma gṛhṇīyāt //	Now (in pronouncing the following text) heinserts his son's name: 'May this son (N.N.) carry on this manly deed of mine !' Should he have no son, let him insert his own name.
athāhavanīyamupatiṣṭhate /	He then steps up to the Âhavanîya fire.
prāṅne yajño 'nusaṃtiṣṭhātā iti tūṣṇīmupatiṣṭhateatha vrataṃ visṛjate /	Silently he steps to it, thinking, 'In the east my sacrifice shall be completed!'

For, in entering upon the vow, he becomes, as it were, non-human; and as it would not be becoming for him to say, 'I enter from truth into untruth;' and as, in fact, he now again becomes man, let him therefore divest himself of the vow, with the text, 'Now am I he that I really am .'
tatsambhārāṇāṃ sambhāratvaṃ yatra yatrāgnernyaktaṃ tatastataḥ sambharati tadyaśaseva tvadevainametatsamardhayati paśubhiriva tvanmithuneneva tvatsambharan //	Now when he equips (Agni, the fire) from this and that quarter, that is the equipping (of the fire) with its equipments . In whatever (objects) some of (the nature of) Agni is inherent, therewith he equips (the fire); and in thus equipping it he supplies it partly with splendour, partly with cattle, partly with a mate.
athollikhati /	In the first place he (the Adhvaryu) draws (three) lines (with the wooden sword on the Gârhapatya fire-place ).
tadyadevāsyai pṛthivyā abhiṣṭhitaṃ vābhiṣṭhyūtaṃ vā tadevāsyā etaduddhantyatha yajñiyāyāmeva pṛthivyāmādhatte tasmādvā ullikhati //	Whatever part of this earthis either trodden or spit upon, that he thereby removes from it; and he thus establishes his fire on earth that is entirely proper for the sacrifice: this is why he draws lines (across the fire-place).
athādbhirabhyukṣati /	He then sprinkles (the lines) with water.
eṣa vā apāṃ sambhāro yadadbhirabhyukṣati tadyadapaḥ sambharatyannaṃ vā āpo 'nnaṃ hi vā āpastasmādyademaṃ lokamāpa āgacantyathehānnādyaṃ jāyate tadannādyenaivainametatsamardhayati //	When he thus sprinkles (the fire-place) with water, that is the equipment (of the fire) with water. The reason why he brings water is that water is food; for water is indeed food: hence when water comes to this world, food is produced here.
yoṣā vā āpaḥ /	Thus he thereby supplies it (the fire) with food.
vṛṣāgnirmithunenaivainametatprajananena samardhayatyadbhirvā idaṃ sarvamāptamadbhirevainametadāptvādhatte tasmādapaḥ sambharati //	And since all this (universe) is pervaded (or obtained, âpta) by water, he sets up the fire, after he has obtained it by means of water . This is why he brings water.
atha hiraṇyaṃ sambharati /	He then brings (a piece of) gold.

For this reason the latter shines like fire, it being Agni'sseed. Hence it (gold) is found in water, for he (Agni) poured it into the water. Hence also one does not cleanse oneself with it , nor does one do anything else with it. Now there is splendour (for the fire): for he thereby makes it to be possessed of divine seed, bestows splendour on it; and sets up a fire completely endowed with seed.
athoṣāntsambharati /	He then brings salt.
asau ha vai dyaurasyai pṛṭhivyā etānpaśūnpradadau tasmātpaśavyamūṣaramityāhuḥ paśavo hyevaite sākṣādeva tatpaśubhirevainametatsamardhayati te 'muta āgatā asyām pṛthivyām pratiṣṭhitāstamanayordyāvāpṛthivyo rasam manyante tadanayorevainametaddyāvāpṛthivyo rasena samardhayati tasmādūṣāntsambharati //	Yonder sky assuredly bestowed that (salt as) cattle on this earth: hence they say that salt soil is suitable for cattle. That (salt), therefore, means cattle; and thus he thereby visibly supplies it (the fire) with cattle; and the latter having come from yonder (sky) is securely established on this earth. Moreover, that (salt) is believed to be the savour (rasa) of those two, the sky and the earth : so that he thereby supplies it (the fire) with the savour of those two, the sky and the earth. That is why he brings salt.
athākhukarīṣaṃ sambharati /	He then brings (the earth of) a mole-hill (âkhu-karîsha) .
ākhavo ha vā asyai pṛthivyai rasaṃ vidustasmātte 'dho 'dha imām pṛthivīṃ carantaḥ pīviṣṭhā asyai hi rasaṃ viduste yatra te 'syai pṛthivyai rasaṃ vidustata utkiranti tadasyā evainametatpṛthivyai rasena samardhayati tasmādākhukarīṣaṃ sambharati purīṣya iti vai tamāhuryaḥ śriyaṃ gacati samānaṃ vai purīṣaṃ ca karīṣaṃ ca tadetasyaivāvaruddhai tasmādākhukarīṣaṃ sambharati //	The moles certainly know thesavour of this earth: hence, by entering deeper and deeper into this earth, they (grow) very fat, knowing, as they do, its savour; and wherever they know the savour of this earth to be, there they cast it up. Hence he thereby supplies it (the fire) with the savour of this earth: that is why he brings a molehill. Moreover, they say of one who has attained prosperity (or splendour, sri) that he is purîshya; and purîsha and karîsha doubtless mean one and the same thing: it is, therefore, for his (Agni's or the sacrificer's) attainment of splendour (sri) that he brings a mole-hill.
atha śarkarāḥ sambharati /	He then brings pebbles.
devāśca vā asurāścobhaye prājāpatyāḥ paspṛdhire sā heyam pṛthivyalelāyadyathā puṣkaraparṇamevaṃ tāṃ ha sma vātaḥ saṃvahati sopaiva devāñjagāmopāsurāntsā yatra devānupajagāma // taddhocuḥ /	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, once contended for superiority. This earth was then trembling like a lotus-leaf; for the wind was tossing it hither and thither: now it came near the gods, now it came near the Asuras. When it came near the gods,--
hantemāṃ pratiṣṭhāṃ dṛṃhāmahai tasyāṃ dhruvāyāmaśithilāyāmagnī ādadhāmahai tato 'syai sapatnānnirbhakṣyāma iti //	They said, 'Come, let us steady this resting-place; and when firm and steady, let us set upthe two fires on it; whereupon we will exclude our enemies from any share in it.'
evamimām pratiṣṭhām paryabṛṃhanta seyaṃ dhruvāśithilā pratiṣṭhā tasyāṃ dhruvāyāmaśithilāyāmagnī ādadhata tato 'syai sapatnānnirabhajan // tatho evaiṣa etat / imām pratiṣṭhāṃ śarkarābhiḥ paribṛṃhate tasyāṃ dhruvāyāmaśithilāyāmagnī ādhatte tato 'syai sapatnānnirbhajati tasmācarkarāḥ sambharati //	Accordingly, in like manner as one would stretch a skin by means of wooden pins, they fastened down this resting-place; and it formed a firm and steady resting-place. And when it was firm and steady, they set up the two fires on it; and thereupon they excluded their enemies from any share in it . And in like manner that one (the Adhvaryu) now fastens down that resting-place by means of pebbles; and on it, when firm and steady, he sets up the two fires; whereupon he excludes the (sacrificer's) enemies from any share in it.
tānvā etān /	This is the reason why he brings pebbles.
pañca sambhārāntsambharati pāṅkto yajñaḥ pāṅktaḥ paśuḥ pañcartavaḥ saṃvatsarasya //	These then are the five equipments : for fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim; and five seasons there are in the year.

And in that case the very deficiency (nyûna) itself is rendered a productive union , since it is from the lower part (nyûna, i.e. of the body) that offspring is here brought forth. Thus also a progressive improvement (is assured to the sacrificer): for this reason there are five equipments. And when (it is nevertheless insisted on that) there are six seasons in the year, then Agni is the sixth of them, and thus there is no deficiency.

For (they argue) all those (objects) are on this earth, and hence, when he establishes the fire on this earth, the latter of itself obtains all those equipments: he need not, therefore, equip it with a single equipment. But let him nevertheless bring (those objects) together; for when he establishes the fire on this (earth), then it obtains all the equipments: and what (benefit) accrues from the equipments being brought together, that also accrues to it .
kṛttikāsvagnī ādadhīta / etā vā agninakṣatraṃ yatkṛttikāstadvai saloma yo 'gninakṣatre 'gnī ādadhātai tasmātkṛttikāsvādadhīta //	He may set up the two fires under the Krittikâs; for they, the Krittikâs, are doubtless Agni's asterism, so that if he sets up his fires under Agni's asterism, (he will bring about) a correspondence (between his fires and the asterism): for this reason he may set up his fires under the Krittikâs.
ekaṃ dve trīṇi / catvārīti vā anyāni nakṣatrāṇyathaitā eva bhūyiṣṭhā yatkṛttikāstadbhūmānamevaitadupaiti tasmātkṛttikāsvādadhīta //	Moreover, the other lunar asterisms (consist of) one, two, three or four (stars), so that the Krittikâs are the most numerous (of asterisms) : hence he thereby obtains an abundance. For this reason he may set up his fires under the Krittikâs.
etā ha vai prācyai diśo na cyavante / sarvāṇi ha vā anyāni nakṣatrāṇi prācyai diśaścyavante tatprācyāmevāsyaitaddiśyāhitau bhavatastasmātkṛttikāsvādadhīta //	And again, they do not move away from the eastern quarter, whilst the other asterisms do move from the eastern quarter. Thus his (two fires) are established in the eastern quarter: for this reason he may set up his fires under the Krittikâs.
atha yasmānna kṛttikāsvādadhīta /	On the other hand (it is argued) why he should not set up the fires under the Krittikâs.
ṛkṣāṇāṃ ha vā etā agre patnya āsuḥ saptarṣīnu ha sma vai purarkṣā ityācakṣate tā mithunena vyārdhyantāmī hyuttarāhi saptarṣaya udyanti pura etā aśamiva vai tadyo mithunena vyṛddhaḥ sa nenmithunena vyṛdhyā iti tasmānna kṛttikāsvādadhīta //	Originally, namely, the latter were the wives of the Bears (riksha); for the seven Rishis were in former timescalled the Rikshas (bears). They were, however, precluded from intercourse (with their husbands), for the latter, the seven Rishis, rise in the north, and they (the Krittikâs) in the east. Now it is a misfortune for one to be precluded from intercourse (with his wife): he should therefore not set up his fires under the Krittikâs, lest he should thereby be precluded from intercourse.
tadvaiva dadhīta / agnirvā etāsāṃ mithunamagninaitā mithunena samṛddhāstasmādaiva dadhīta //	But he may nevertheless set up (his fire under the Krittikâs); for Agni doubtless is their mate, and it is with Agni that they have intercourse: for this reason he may set up (the fire under the Krittikâs).
rohiṇyāmagnī ādadhīta /	He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of Rohinî.
rohiṇyāṃ ha vai prajāpatiḥ prajākāmo 'gnī ādadhe sa prajā asṛjata tā asya prajāḥ sṛṣṭā ekarūpā upastabdhāstasthū rohiṇya ivaiva tadvai rohiṇyai rohiṇītvam bahurhaiva prajayā paśubhirbhavati ya evaṃ vidvānrohiṇyāmādhatte //	For under Rohinî it was that Pragâpati, when desirous of progeny (or creatures), set up his fires. He created beings, and the creatures produced by him remained invariable and constant , like (red) cows (rohinî): hence the cow-like nature of Rohinî. Rich in cattle and offspring therefore he becomes whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Rohinî.
agnī ādadhire manuṣyāṇāṃ kāmaṃ rohemeti te manuṣyāṇāṃ kāmamarohanyamu haiva tatpaśavo manuṣyeṣu kāmamarohaṃstamu haiva paśuṣu kāmaṃ rohati ya evaṃ vidvānrohiṇyāmādhatte //	Under Rohinî, indeed, the cattle set up their fires, thinking that they might attain to (ruh) the desire (or love) of men. They did attain to thedesire of men; and whatever desire the cattle then obtained in regard to men, that same desire he obtains, in regard to cattle, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under Rohinî.
mṛgaśīrṣe 'gnī ādadhīta /	He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of) Mrigasîrsha.
etadvai prajāpateḥ śiro yanmṛgaśīrṣaṃ śrīrvai śiraḥ śrīrhi vai śirastasmādyo 'rdhasya śreṣṭho bhavatyasāvamuṣyārdhasya śira ityāhuḥ śriyaṃ ha gacati ya evaṃ vidvānmṛgaśīrṣa ādhatte //	For Mrigasîrsha, indeed, is the head of Pragâpati ; and the head (siras) means excellence (srî), for the head does indeed mean excellence: hence they say of him who is the most excellent (sreshtha) of a community, that he is the head of that community. Excellence therefore he attains whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under Mrigasîrsha.
atha yasmānnā mṛgaśīrṣa ādadhīta /	On the other hand (it is argued) why one should not set up his fire under Mrigasîrsha .
prajāpatervā etacarīraṃ yatra vā enaṃ tadāvedhyaṃstadiṣuṇā trikāṇḍenetyāhuḥ sa etacarīramajahādvāstu vai śarīramayajñiyaṃ nirvīryaṃ tasmānna mṛgaśīrṣa ādadhīta //	The latter, indeed, is Pragâpati's body. Now, when they (the gods) on that occasion pierced him with what is called 'the three-knotted arrow,' he abandoned thatbody, for the body is a mere relic (or dwelling, vâstu), unholy and sapless. He should therefore not set up his fires under Mrigasîrsha.
tadvaiva dadhīta /	But he may, nevertheless, set them up (under Mrigasîrsha).
na vā etasya devasya vāstu nāyajñiyaṃ na śarīramasti yatprajāpatestasmādaiva dadhīta punarvasvoḥ punarādheyamādadhīteti //	For, assuredly, the body of that god, Pragâpati, is neither a relic nor unholy, : he may therefore set up (his fires under Mrigasîrsha). 'Under the Punarvasû he should perform the Punarâdheya ,' thus (it is prescribed).
phalgunīṣvagnī ādadhīta /	He may also set up his fires under the Phalgunîs.
etā vā indranakṣatraṃ yatphalgunyo 'pyasya pratināmnyo 'rjuno ha vai nāmendro yadasya guhyaṃ nāmārjunyo vai nāmaitāstā etatparo 'kṣamācakṣate phalgunya iti ko hyetasyārhati guhyaṃ nāma grahītumindro vai yajamānastatsva evaitannakṣatre 'gnī ādhatta indro yajñasya devataiteno hāsyaitatsendramagnyodheyaṃ bhavati pūrvayorādadhīta purastātkraturhaivāsme bhavatyuttarayorādadhīta śvaḥśreyasaṃ haivāsmā uttarāvadbhavati //	They, the Phalgunîs, are Indra's asterism , and even correspond to him in name; for indeed Indra is also called Arguna, this being his mystic name; and they (the Phalgunîs) are also called Argunîs. Hence he overtly calls them Phalgunîs, for who dares to use his (the god's) mystic name? Moreover, the sacrificer himself is Indra, so that he in that case sets up his fires under his own asterism. Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; and accordingly his Agnyâdheya is thereby broughtinto relation with Indra. He may set up the fires under the first (Pûrva-phalgunîs)--whereby an advancing (successful) sacrifice accrues to him; or he may set them up under the second (Uttara-phalgunîs)--whereby a progressive (uttarâvat) improvement accrues to him.
haste 'gnīy ādadhīta / ya icetpra me dīyeteti tadvā anuṣṭhyā yaddhastena pradīyate pra haivāsmai dīyate //	Let him set up his fires under the asterism Hasta , whosoever should wish that (presents) should be offered him: then indeed (that will take place) forthwith; for whatever is offered with the hand (hasta), that indeed is given to him.
citrāyāmagnī ādadhīta /	He may also set up his fires under Kitrâ.
devāśca vā asurāścobhaye prājāpatyāḥ paspṛdhire ta ubhaya evāmuṃ lokaṃ samārurukṣāṃ cakrurdivameva tato 'surā rauhiṇamityagniṃ cikyire 'nenāmuṃ lokaṃ samārokṣyāma iti //	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending for superiority. Both parties were desirous of rising to yonder world, the sky. The Asuras then constructed the fire (altar) called rauhina (fit to ascend by), thinking, 'Thereby we shall ascend (â-ruh) to the sky .'
indro ha vā īkṣāṃ cakre / imaṃ cedvā ime cinvate tata eva no 'bhibhavantīti sa brāhmaṇo bruvāṇa ekeṣṭakāṃ prabadhyeyāya //	Indra then considered , 'If they construct that (fire-altar), they will certainly prevail over us.' He secured a brick and proceeded thither, passing himself off for a Brâhman. 'Hark ye!' he said, 'I, too, will put on this (brick) for myself!' 'Very well,' they replied.
sa hovāca /	He put it on.
hantāhamimāmapyupadadhā iti tatheti tāmupādhatta teṣāmalpakādevāgnirasaṃcita āsa //	That fire (altar) of theirs wanted but very little to be completely built up,--
anvā ahaṃ tāṃ dāsye yā mameheti tāmabhipadyābabarha tasyāmāvṛḍhāyāmagnirvyavaśaśādāgnervyavaśādamanvasurā vyavaśeduḥ sa tā eveṣṭhkā vajrān kṛtvā grīvāḥ praciceda //	When he said, 'I shall take back this (brick) which belongs to me.' He took hold of it and pulled it out; and on its being pulled out, the fire-altar fell down; and along with the falling fire-altar the Asuras fell down. He then converted those bricks into thunderbolts and clove the (Asuras') necks.
ta ha devāḥ sametyocuḥ / citra vā abhūma ya iyataḥ sapatnānavadhiṣmeti tadvai citrāyai citrātvaṃ citraṃ ha bhavati hanti sapatnānhanti dviṣantaṃ bhrātṛvyaṃ ya evaṃ vidvāṃścitrāyāmādhatte tasmādetatkṣatriya eva nakṣatramupertsejjighāṃsatīva hyeṣa sapatnānvīva jigīṣate //	Thereupon the gods assembled and said, 'Wonderfully (kitram) indeed it has fared with us who have slain so many enemies!' Hence the wonderful nature (kitrâtva) of the asterism[paragraph continues] Kitrâ; and verily wonderfully it fares with him, and he slays his rivals, his spiteful enemy, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Kitrâ. A Kshatriya, therefore, should especially desire to take advantage of this asterism; since such a one is anxious to strike, to vanquish his enemies.
nānā ha vā etānyagre kṣatrāṇyāsuḥ /	Originally these (nakshatras) were so many different powers (kshatra), just as that sun yonder.
yathaivāsau sūrya evaṃ teṣāmeṣa udyanneva vīryaṃ kṣatramādatta tasmādādityo nāma yadeṣāṃ vīryaṃ kṣatramādatta //	But as soon as he rose, he took from them (â-dâ) their energy, their power; therefore he (the sun) is called Âditya, because he took from them their energy, their power .
te ha devā ūcuḥ /	The gods then said, 'They who have been powers, shall no longer (na) be powers (kshatra) !' Hence the powerlessness (na-kshatratvam) of the nakshatras.

But if he (the sacrificer) should nevertheless be desirous of having a nakshatra (under which to set up his fires), then assuredly that sun is a faultless nakshatra for him; and through that auspicious day (marked by the rising and setting of the sun) he should endeavour to obtain the benefits of whichever of those asterisms he might desire. Let him therefore take the sun alone for his nakshatra .
te devā ṛtavaḥ śaraddhemantaḥ śiśiraste pitaro ya evāpūryate 'rdhamāsaḥ sa devā yo 'pakṣīyate sa pitaro 'hareva devā rātriḥ pitaraḥ punarahnaḥ pūrvāhṇo devā aparāhṇaḥ pitaraḥ //	The spring, the summer, and the rains, these seasons (represent) the gods; and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season represent the fathers. That half-moon which increases represents the gods, and that which decreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods, and the night represents the fathers.

Him the gods favour at his invocation of the gods, and him the fathers favour at his invocation of the fathers, whosoever, knowing this, invokes (the seasons) as the gods and fathers.
deveṣu tarhi bhavati devāṃstarhyabhigopāyatyatha yatra dakṣiṇāvartate pitṛṣu tarhi bhavati pitṝṃstarhyabhigopāyati //	Now when he (the sun) moves northwards, then he is among the gods, then he guards the gods; and when he moves southwards, then he is among the fathers, then he guards the fathers .

Whosoever, on the other hand, sets up his fires when (the sun) moves southwards, he does not dispel the evil from him,--since the fathers have not the evil dispelled from them (by the sun). The fathers are mortal: hence he dies before (he has attained the full measure of) life, whosoever sets up his fires during that time.

He should therefore set up his fires at any time, when he feels called upon to sacrifice; and should not put it off from one day to the morrow: for who knows the morrow of man ?
yadaharasya śvo 'gnyādheyaṃ syāt /	On the day preceding his Agnyâdheya, he (the sacrificer with his wife) should take his food in the day-time.

However, he may also, if he choose, take food at night,since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not performed Agnyâdheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial) fire of his own, he is merely a man, and may therefore, if he choose, take food at night.

He need not, however, do this: for indeed that same wish (which he entertains in so doing) he obtains by the very fact that Brahmans, be they sacrificial priests or not, are residing in his family (kula) : he need, therefore, take no notice of that (practice).

And, indeed, it is not proper that they should either carry to the south, or extinguish, that fire on which a kindling-stick is put, or an oblation made, with a rik or a sâman or a yagus. Now they do indeed either take it to the south with the view of its becoming the Anvâhâryapakana (or Dakshinâgni), or (if there is to be no Dakshinâgni) they extinguish it .

He may, however, sleep, if he choose, since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not performed Agnyâdheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial) fire of his own, he is a mere man; and he may, therefore, sleep, if he choose.

But let him not do so; for when they thus churn (the fire) before sunrise, and take it eastwards after sunrise, both his (fires) are in reality set up before sunrise. By churning the Âhavanîya after sunrise he will obtain that (combination of blessings).

The gods have the evil dispelled from them (by the sun): hence he (the sacrificer) dispels the evil (from himself, if he churn after sunrise). The gods are immortal; and--though there is for him no prospect of immortality--he attains (the full measure of life). The gods are bliss, and bliss he obtains; the gods are glorious, and glorious he will be, whosoever, knowing this, churns (the fire) after the rising of the sun.

Verily, that (fire) is of the brahman: with the brahman it is set up. The brahman is speech: of that speech it is. The brahman is the truth, and the truth consists in those same (three) mystic utterances: hence his (fire) is established by means of the truth.

Two syllables he leaves over, and thereby those (five syllables) become of renewed efficacy; and with all the five syllables--'Bhûr bhuvah svah'--he lays down the Âhavanîya. Thus result eight syllables; for of eight syllables consists the gâyatrî, and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: he thus establishes that (fire) by means of its own metre.

For this reason let him (the Adhvaryu) direct (the Âgnîdhra) to lead the horse to where he is about to churn the fire. It stands in front of him : he thus raises the thunderbolt, and in its safe and foeless shelter the fire is produced.

Should he be unable to obtain a leader, it may be any kind of horse. Should he be unable to obtain a horse, it may also be an ox, since that (fire) is related (bandhu) to the ox .

And, verily, from whomsoever it (the fire) turns away, from him the sacrifice also turns away; and if any one were to curse him, saying, 'May the sacrifice turn away from him!' then he would indeed be liable to fare thus.

The horse doubtless represents strength: hence he makes it turn round again in order that this strength shall not turn away from him (the sacrificer).
tamaśvasya pada ādhatte / vīryaṃ vā aśvo vīrya evainametadādhatte tasmādaśvasya pada ādhatte //	He lays that (fire) down on the horse's footprint ; for the horse represents strength, so that he thereby lays it down on strength: for this reason he lays it down on the horse's foot-print.

For he who wants to lift a load without having a firm footing on this (earth), cannot lift it; nay, it crushes him.

When he says, 'Like unto the sky in plenty,' he means to say, 'Like as yonder sky is plenteous with stars, so may I become plenteous!' and when he says, 'Like unto the earth in greatness,' he means to say, 'As great as this earth is so great may I become!'--'On that back of thine, O Earth, that art meet for the worship of the gods'--for on her back he lays down that (fire)--'I lay down Agni, the eater of food, for the obtainment of food.' Agni is an eater of food: 'May I become an eater of food,' this is what he thereby says.

Thus he recites; and whatever (benefit) has not been obtained by him either through the equipments, or through the asterisms, or through the seasons, or through the laying down of the fire, all that is thereby obtained by him; and for this reason he stands worshipping by (the fire), while muttering the verses of the queen of serpents.

For the queen of serpents, they argue, is this earth; and accordingly when he lays down the fire on her, he thereby obtains all his desires: hence he need not stand by (the fire) worshipping with the verses of the queen of serpents.

Even as (a mother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born child or calf, so does he thereby offer food to him.

sarvaṃ vai pūrṇaṃ sarveṇaivainametacamayati svāhākāreṇa juhotyanirukto vai svāhākāraḥ sarvaṃ vā aniruktaṃ sarveṇaivainametacamayati //	He offers it (with a) full (spoon); for the full doubtless means the All (universe), so that he thereby appeases him with the All. He offers it with 'Svâhâ!' for the Svâhâ is undefined, and undefined also is the All, so that he thereby appeases him by means of the All.

Now that (offering) indeed is virtually the same as this one; and hence he (the sacrificer) also makes it with 'Svâhâ!' At this (offering) he grants a boon (to the priests) ; buta boon (may mean) everything, so that he thereby appeases him (Agni) with everything.

prāṇo vai pavamānaḥ prāṇamevāsminnetaddadhāti tadvetayaivāsmiṃstaddadhātyannaṃ hi prāṇo 'nnameṣāhutiḥ //	Now the blowing one is the breath, so that he thereby puts breath into him (the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering); for breath means food, and this offering also is food.

annaṃ vai pāvakamannamevāsminnetaddadhāti tadvetayaivāsmiṃstaddadhātyeṣā hyeva pratyakṣamannamāhutiḥ //	Now the purifying one means food, so that he thereby puts food into him (Agni, or the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering), for this offering is indeed food.

And this he puts into him by means of this (offering); for when he offers up that oblation in him (Agni), then that vigour, that brightness of his blazes up.

But let him nevertheless take out the subsequent oblations; for what invisible (blessing, or meaning) there was in that (full-offering) that now becomes thus (visible).
sa yadagnaye pavamānāya nirvapati /	Now the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pavamâna, is that the blowing one is the breath.

And as long as it is not born, it breathes in accord with the mother's breath; but when it is born, then he thereby puts breath into it.
atha yadagnaye pāvakāya nirvapati / annaṃ vai pāvakaṃ tajjāta evāsminnetadannaṃ dadhāti //	And the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pâvaka, is that the purifying one means food: hence he thereby puts food into (the child) when it is born.
atha yadagnaye śucaye nirvapati / vīryaṃ vai śuci yadā vā annena vardhate 'tha vīryaṃ tadannenaivainametadvardhayitvāthāsminnetadvīryaṃ śuci dadhāti tasmādagnaye śucaye //	And the reason why he makes offering to Agni Suki, is that brightness means vigour. Now when it (the child) grows by means of food, then there is vigour; and hence, when he has made it grow by means of food, he thereby puts into it that vigour, that brightness. This is why (he offers) to Agni Suki.
tadvetadeva sadviparyastamiva /	That other (practice) then is altogether erroneous .
agnirha yatra devebhyo manuṣyānabhyupāvavarta taddhekṣāṃ cakre maiva sarveṇevātmanā manuṣyānabhyupāvṛtamiti //	For when Agni passed over from the gods to men, he bethought him, 'I must not pass over to men with my whole body!'
sa etāstisrastanūreṣu lokeṣu vinyadhatta /	He then laid down in these (three) worlds those three bodies of his.

Now the Rishis then existing became aware of this: 'Agni has not come to us with his whole body,' they said.
sa yadagnaye pavamānāya nirvapati /	They then prepared those oblations for him.

For this reason also he should take out the oblations subsequent (to the full-offering).

Now the first oblation represents this world, the second one that ether, and the third one the sky. But this earth is compact; and the ether and yonder sky are, as it were, trembling: and in order that these two may counterbalance that (earth), the (last) two (oblations) have one barhis in common.

In all, these potsherds amount to twenty-four; for of twenty-four syllables consists the gâyatrî (stanza), and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: with its own metre he accordingly establishes that fire.

pracyavata iva vā eṣo 'smāllokādya etāni havīṃṣi nirvapatīmānhi lokāntsamārohanneti //	For he who performs those (preceding) oblations moves away, as it were, from this world, since he moves in the ascent of these worlds .

This is why he offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi.
tasyai virājau saṃyājye syātāmityāhuḥ / virāḍḍhīyamityatho triṣṭubhau triṣṭubbhīyamityatho jagatyau jagatī hīyamiti virājāvityeva syātām //	For her, they say, the two samyâgyâs should be virâg verses; for the virâg is this (earth); ortrishtubh verses, for the trishtubh is this (earth); or gagatî verses, for the gagatî is this (earth). Still, however, they should be virâg verses.

The cow is a mother, and this (earth) also is a mother, for she bears the men: for this reason the priests' fee is a cow.

For this reason he offers (a cake) to Agni , and then a potful of boiled rice to Aditi.

Whatever, therefore, fails in this sacrifice when slain, that he now again invigorates by means of gifts to the priests; whereupon the sacrifice becomes successful: for this reason he makes gifts to the priests.

Such is the measure of the priests' fees; but he may give more, according to (the depth of) his faith. The reason why he gives fees to the priests is this.

The sacrifice of these is divided into two kinds: oblations constitute the sacrifice to the gods; and gifts to the priests that to the human gods,the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. With oblations one gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. Both these kinds of gods, when gratified, place him in a state of bliss (sudhâ) .

Such, then, (is the manner) of gifts to priests.

Among these two (classes of beings) who were mortal, Agni alone was immortal; and it was through him, the immortal, that they both lived. Now whichsoever (of the gods) they (the Asuras) slew, he, indeed, was so (slain).

When we have placed that immortal element in our innermost soul, and become immortal and unconquerable, we shall overcome our conquerable, mortal enemies.'

Now that fire, which the Asuras thus laid down, is this same (fire) wherewith men prepare their food.

And so this one now establishes that immortal element in his innermost soul; and--though there is for him no hope of immortality--he obtains the full measure of life; for, indeed, he becomes unconquerable, and his enemy, though striving to conquer, conquers him not. And, accordingly, when one who has established his fires and one who has not established his fires, vie with each other, he who has established his fires overcomes the other, for, verily, he thereby becomes unconquerable, he thereby becomes immortal.

He again draws in his breath: thereby he establishes that (fire) in his innermost soul; and that fire thus becomes established in his innermost soul .

And as to its becoming extinguished:--surely, as long as he lives, that fire which has been established in his innermost soul, does not become extinct in him.

And whosoever speaks the untruth, acts asif he sprinkled that lighted fire with water; for even so does he enfeeble it: and ever the less becomes his own vital energy, and day by day does he become more wicked.

Soma (established the fire), being desirous of glory. He became glorious, and, accordingly, whether one obtains a hold on Soma, or whetherone does not, they both obtain (glory),--for it is glory that people thereby get to see. Glorious therefore he becomes, and sovereignty he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, establishes a sacrificial fire of his own.

In that (fire) those two kinds of forms are seen: such is the ascendancy (which one obtains by the punarâdhyeya),--people, indeed, envy him; thus he thrives, and a conspicuous position (is obtained by him).

This, then, is the reason why he should establish the fires (a second time).

The rains, then, are one of the forms of manifestation (rûpa) of all seasons ; and when people say, 'To-day it is as if in summer,' then that is in the rainy season; and when they say, 'To-day it is as if in spring,' then that, too, is in the rainy season.

But the sun also is all the seasons: when he rises, then it is spring;--when the cows are driven together (for milking), then it is summer;--when it is mid-day, then is the rainy season;--when it is afternoon, then it is autumn;--when he sets, then it is winter. At mid-day (madhyandina), therefore, he should establish his fires, for then that (sun) is nearest to this world, and hence he produces that (fire) from the nearest centre (madhya).

For this reason also he should establish his fires (the second time) at mid-day.

Now sacrificial grass means water, and the rainy season also means water.

[Some do so] arguing, 'Thereby we cover them with the first two fires;' but let him not do so, for it is by the nights that they come to be covered.

Now the other sacrifice belongs to all the deities, but this belongs specially to Agni; and what is (kept) secret, that is (spoken of) in a low voice: this is why they perform it in a low voice.

He then says , 'Svâhâ Agnim!' with reference to Agni's butter-portion;--'Svâhâ Agnim Pavamânam!' if they determine upon (offering to) Agni, the blowing ; or 'Svâhâ Agnim Indumantam!' if they determine upon Agni, the drop-abounding ;--'Svâhâ Agnim!'--'Svâhâ, the butter-drinking Agnis! May Agni graciously accept of the butter!'--this is the offering-prayer he (the Hotri) pronounces.

He (the Hotri) recites , 'Awake Agni with praise, enkindling the immortal, that he may take our offerings to the gods!' For, indeed, when Agni is removed (from the hearth) , he, as it were, sleeps: he (the priest) now awakens, rouseshim.

If, on the other hand, they determine upon (offering to) Agni Indumat, let him say, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Indumat!' He (the Hotri) recites , 'Come hither, I will gladly sing to thee yet other songs, O Agni! mayest thou grow strong by these draughts (indu, drop).' Thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni: the draught doubtless means Soma, but this (Soma-element) they eliminate from the butter-portion of Soma.

In order to avoid sameness, no two (of these forms) are alike; but (the fault of) sameness he would undoubtedly commit, were any two of them alike. The characteristic form of the fore-offerings is (alternately), 'May they accept,' 'May it (or he) accept ;' and that of the after-offerings is, 'For the abundant obtainment of abundant gift.'

Or it may be an ox; for the latter is of the nature of Agni as far as its shoulder is concerned, since its shoulder (by carrying the yoke) is as if burnt by fire. Moreover, Agni is oblation-bearer to the gods, and that (ox) bears (or draws, loads) for men: this is why an ox may be given as the priests' fee.

He generated Agni from his mouth; and because he generated him from his mouth, therefore Agni is a consumer of food: and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.

At that time this earth had, indeed, been rendered quite bald; there were neither plants nor trees. This, then, weighed on his mind.

Now his own greatness is his speech: that speech of his departed from him. He desired an offering in his own self, and rubbed (his hands); and because he rubbed (his hands), therefore both this and this (palm) are hairless. He then obtained either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but, indeed, they are both milk.

His own greatness said to him, 'Offer it up!' Pragâpati was aware that it was his own (sva) greatness that had spoken (âha) to him; and offered it up with 'Svâhâ!' This is why offerings are made with 'Svâhâ!' Thereupon that burning one (viz. the sun) rose; and then that blowing one (viz. the wind) sprang up; whereupon, indeed, Agni turned away.

Even as he is born from his father and mother, so is he born from the fire. But he who offers not the Agnihotra, verily, he does not come into life at all: therefore the Agnihotra should by all means be offered.

Having enclosed (a piece of ground), they sang praises with the gâyatrî stanza without the 'Hiṅ :' and that (with) which they enclosed was the ocean; and this earth was the praising-ground (âstâva). When they had sung praises, they went out towards the east, saying, 'We (will) go back thither!' The gods came upon a cow which had sprung into existence.

The gods perceived that this was the 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman (melodious sacrificial chant); for heretofore (their song was) without the but after that it was the (real) Sâman. And as this same sound 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman was in the cow, therefore the latter affords the means of subsistence; and so does he afford the means of subsistence whosoever thus knows that 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman in the cow.

Hence it is warm when first milked; for it is Agni's seed.

They did not come to an agreement; and not being agreed, they said, 'Let us go to our father Pragâpati; and to whichever of us he says it shall be offered first, to him they shall first offer this.' They went to their father Pragâpati, and said, 'To whom of us shall they offer this first?'

'Then to thee,' he said to Sûrya; 'and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that shall belong to that blower[paragraph continues] (Vâyu)!' And, accordingly, they in the same way offer this (milk) to them till this day: in the evening to Agni, and in the morning to Sûrya; and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that, indeed, belongs to that blower.

And whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, he, indeed, is produced in the same way in which they were then produced, he gains that same victory which they then gained;--indeed, he shares the same world with them, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra. Therefore the Agnihotra should certainly be performed.

Now all the gods approach the house of him who performs the Agnihotra: but whosesoever (offering) they approach before the fire has been taken out, from that the gods turn away, and he fails in it; and after the failure of that (offering) from which the gods turn away, people say, that, whether one knows it or not, the sun went down on account of that (fire) not having been taken out.

Therefore Âsuri said, 'The Agnihotra of those who offer after sunrise we regard as useless : it is as if one were to take food to an empty dwelling.'

And when he afterwards takes his evening meal, he eats what remains of the offering, and whereof oblative portions (bali) have been distributed all round ; for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering. And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, 'I will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on this which belongs to them.' And when he afterwards takes his meal in the day-time, he eats what remains of theoffering, and whereof oblative portions have been distributed all round; for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering.

Although that which lasts for twelve years is indeed limited, this (Agnihotra) is nevertheless unlimited, since, when one has offered in the evening, he knows that he will offer in the morning; and when one has offered in the morning, he knows that he will again offer in the evening. Hence that Agnihotra is unlimited, and in consequence of this its unlimitedness, creatures are here born unlimited. And, verily, he who thus knows the unlimitedness of the Agnihotra, is himself born unlimited in prosperity and offspring.

He must not however let it rise to the brim, since he would burn it, if he were to let it rise to the brim; and unproductive indeed is burnt seed: he must not, therefore, let it rise to the brim. He should not offer it without having put it on the fire; for since this is Agni's seed, therefore it is hot (srita, 'cooked'); and by putting it on thefire, it is indeed heated: let him, therefore, offer (of the milk) only after he has put it on the fire.

For when it rains here; then plants spring up; and in consequence of the plants being eaten and the water drunk, this juice is produced: hence it is in order to supplement the juice (that he pours water to it); and therefore, if it should happen to him to have to drink pure milk, let him have one drop of water poured into it, both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice.
atha caturunnayati /	Thereupon he ladles four times (milk with the sruva into the Agnihotra ladle ), for in a fourfold way was that milk supplied .

For, were he to put it down beside (the fire), it would be as if, in taking food to somebody, one were to put it down on one's way thither. But when (he makes the libation) without previously putting it down, it is as if, in taking food to somebody, one puts it down only after taking it to him. The second (libation he then makes) after putting it down: he thereby makes these two (libations) of various vigour. Now these two: libations are mind and speech: hence he thereby separates mind and speech from each other; and thus mind and speech, even while one and the same (samâna), are still distinct (nânâ).

And what he wipes off (the spoons), that he offers to the fathers and plants; and thereby the fathers and plants are (admitted). And what he eats after offering, that he offers to men; and thereby men are (admitted).

This then is the animalcharacteristic of that (Agnihotra), for the domestic offering pertains to beasts (or cattle).

taddvayamevaite āhutī /	Moreover, this second libation is made in order to effect a pairing, for a couple forms a productive pair.
bhūtaṃ caiva bhaviṣyacca jātaṃ ca janiṣyamāṇaṃ cāgataṃ cāśā cādya ca śvaśca taddvayamevānu //	These two libations, then, form a duad: the past and the future, the born and the to-be-born, the actual and the hope, the to-day and the morrow,--(these are) after the manner of that duad.
ātmaiva bhūtam / addhā hi tadyadbhūtamaddho tadyadātmā prajaiva bhaviṣyadanaddhā hi tadyadbhaviṣyadanaddho tadyatprajā //	The past is the self, for certain is that which is past, and certain also is that which is a self. The future, on the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is that which is to be, and uncertain also is progeny.

The to-be-born,on the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is what is to be born, and uncertain also is progeny.

And that second one is offered on account of progeny: he offers it silently, for uncertain is what (is done) silently, and uncertain also is progeny.

Thus offering is made with the truth; for, truly, when the sun goes down, then Agni (fire) is the light, and when the sun rises, then Sûrya is the light; and whatever is offered with the truth, that, indeed, goes to the gods. Here now Takshan recited for Âruni , who wished to obtain holy lustre (brahmavarkasa, inspired nature), 'Agni is lustre, light is lustre;'--'Sûrya is lustre, light is lustre.' Holy lustre, therefore, he obtains whosoever, knowing this, thus offers the Agnihotra.

Such, indeed, is the case with those who offer after sunrise; for when the sun sets then Agni is the light, and when the sun rises then Sûrya is the light. Here no offence is committed on his (the sacrificer's) part; but an offence is indeed committed where offering is not made distinctly to that deity (viz. Agni or Sûrya resp.), which is the deity of the Agnihotra.[paragraph continues] He says , 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' and not, 'To Agni Svâhâ!' and in the morning, 'Sûrya is the light, the light is Sûrya, Svâhâ!' and not, 'To Sûrya Svâhâ!'

What is to be my share then? The residue of the Agnihotra!' Now what he leaves inthe ladle, that is the residue of the Agnihotra; and what remains in the pot, is as (the rice for oblations which) one takes out from the enclosed part (of the cart) . And if any one is to drink it, at least none but a Brâhman must drink it : for it is put on the fire (and thereby consecrated), and hence none but a Brâhman must drink it.

And when, on stepping back to the Gârhapatya, he either sits or lies down, that is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when, in walking (out of the sacrificial ground), he remembers the Anvâhâryapakana, and thus, in his mind, tarries near it, that is the homage rendered to that (fire).

And, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, his cattle will be more numerous than those (human beings) that have to be supported by him: for he, indeed, is in a prosperous condition whose cattle are more numerous than those (human beings) dependent on his support.

But those that are on the other side of him are the gods, and they are therefore immortal. It is by the rays (or reins, thongs, rasmi) of that (sun) that all these creatures are attached to the vital airs (breaths or life), and therefore the rays extend down to the vital airs.

And whosoever goes to yonder world not having escaped that Death, him he causes to die again and again in yonder world, even as, in this world, one regards not him that is fettered, but puts him to death whenever one wishes.

And when he (the sun) rises, then, in rising, he takes him up and thus he (the sacrificer) escapes that Death. This, then, is the release from death in the Agnihotra: and, verily, he who knows that release from death in the Agnihotra, is freed from death again and again.
yathā vā iṣoranīkam /	What the arrow-head is to the arrow, that the Agnihotra is to sacrifices.

pūrveṇāhavanīyam parītya /	[The sacrificer] having gone round the Âhavanîya, (after entering) from the east , passesbetween (it and) the Gârhapatya (to his seat).

Moreover, Agni (the fire) is the repeller of evil; and these two, the Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya, repel the evil from him who passes between them; and the evil being repelled from him, he becomes a very light in splendour and glory.
uttarato vā agnihotrasya dvāram / sa yathā dvārā prapadyetaivaṃ tadatha yo dakṣiṇata etyāste yathā bahirdhā caredevaṃ tat //	On the north side is the door of the Agnihotra : thus (he approaches it) as he would enter (a house) by a door. If, on the other hand, he were to sit down after approaching from the south, it would be as if he walked outside.
yadagnihotraṃ tasyā etasyai nāvaḥ svargyāyā āhavanīyaścaiva gārhapatyaśca naumaṇḍe athaiṣa eva nāvājo yatkṣīrahotā //	The Agnihotra, truly, is the ship (that sails) heavenwards. The Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya are the two sides of that same heavenward-bound ship; and that milk-offerer is its steersman.

When ascended from the north it makes him reach the heavenly world; but if one were to sit down in it after entering from the south, it would be as if he tried to enter it after it has put off and he were left behind and remained outside.

prajāpatirvā agniḥ /	The fire, assuredly, is Pragâpati,--and Pragâpati is the year.

sapta ca vai śatānyaśītīnāmṛcaḥ /	Seven hundred and twenty eighties of Rik-verses (he should recite at the Agnihotra in the course of a year).
viṃśatiśca sa yatsāyam prātaragnihotraṃ juhoti te dve āhutī tā asya saṃvatsara āhutayaḥ sampadyante //	When he offers the Agnihotra in the morning and evening, then there are two libations: hence those libations of his, in the course of a year, amount to--
sapta caiva śatāni viṃśatiśca /	Seven hundred and twenty.
saṃvatsare saṃvatsare ha vā asyāgnihotram mahatokthena sampadyate saṃvatsare saṃvatsare mahadukthamāpnoti ya evaṃ vidvānagnihotram juhotyetadu hāsyāgnihotram mahatokthena sampadyate mahadukthamāpnoti //	Thus, indeed, his Agnihotra is accomplished, year after year, with the great chant ; and year after year does he obtainthe great chant, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.
agnau ha vai devāḥ / sarvānpaśūnnidadhire ye ca grāmyā ye cāraṇyā vijayaṃ vopapraiṣyantaḥ kāmacārasya vā kāmāyāyaṃ no gopiṣṭho gopāyaditi vā //	Once on a time the gods deposited with Agni all their beasts, both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle or from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best protector.
tānu hāgnirnicakame /	Now Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the night with them.

Now they knew that he had entered there, that he had entered the night; and when the night returned in the evening, they approached him and said, 'Give us our beasts! give us back our beasts!' Agni then gave them back their beasts. For this then let him respectfully approach the two fires: the fires are givers, and thereby he supplicates them.
agnī vai dātārau tāvevaitadyācate sāyamupatiṣṭheta sāyaṃ hi devā upātiṣṭhanta datto haivāsmā etau paṣūnya evaṃ vidvānupatiṣṭhate //	Let him approach them in the evening, for in the evening the gods approached (Agni). And whosoever, knowing this, approaches (the two fires), to him, indeed, they grant cattle.
atha yasmānnopatiṣṭheta /	Then as to why he should not approach them.
ubhaye ha vā idamagre sahāsurdevāśca manuṣyāśca tadyaddha sma manuṣyāṇāṃ na bhavati taddha sma devānyācanta idaṃ vai no nāstīdaṃ no 'stviti te tasyā eva yāñcyāyai dveṣeṇa devāstirobhūtā neddhinasāni neddveṣyo 'sānīti tasmānnopatiṣṭheta //	Now in the beginning both the gods and men were together here. And whatever did not belong to the men, for that they importuned the gods, saying, 'This is not ours: let it be ours!' Being indignantat this importunity, the gods then disappeared. Hence (it may be argued) one should not approach (the fires), fearing lest he should offend them, lest he should become hateful to them.
atha yasmādupaiva tiṣṭheta /	Then as to why he should nevertheless approach (the fires).
yajño vai devānāmāśīryajamānasya tadvā eṣa eva yajño yadāhutirāśīreva yajamānasya tadyadevāsyātra tadevaitadupatiṣṭhamānaḥ kurute tasmādupaiva tiṣṭheta //	The sacrifice, assuredly, belongs to the gods, and the prayer for blessing to the sacrificer. Now the (Agnihotra) libation, doubtless, is the same as the sacrifice; and what he does in now approaching (the fires), that indeed is the sacrificer's prayer for blessing.
atha yasmānnopatiṣṭheta /	And again, why he should not approach (the fires).
yo vai brāhmaṇaṃ vā śaṃsamāno 'nucarati kṣatriyaṃ vāyam me dāsyatyayam me gṛhān kariṣyatīti yo vai taṃ vādyena vā karmaṇā vābhirirādhayiṣati tasmai vai sa deyam manyate 'tha ya āha kiṃ nu tvam mamāsi yo me na dadāsītīśvara enaṃ dveṣṭorīśvaro nirvedaṃ gantostasmānnopatiṣṭhetaitadittvevaiṣa eta yācate yadinddhe yajjuhoti tasmānnopatiṣṭheta //	Whosoever follows either a Brâhman or Kshatriya, praising him, thinking, 'He will give me gifts, he will build me a house,' to him, if he strives to please him both in speech and deed, that (master of his) will think himself bound to give gifts. Whosoever, on the other hand, says, 'What art thou to me, that givest me nothing?' him that (master) is likely to hate, to become disgusted with. Hence one should not approach (the fire); for by kindling and offering in it, he already supplicates it, and he should not therefore approach (and importune it again).
atha yasmādupaiva tiṣṭheta /	And again, why he should nevertheless approach (the fires).
uta vai yācandātāraṃ labhata evoto bhartā bhāryaṃ nānubudhyate sa yadaivāha bhāryo vai te 'smi bibhṛhi metyathainaṃ vedāthainam bhāryam manyate tasmādupaiva tiṣṭhetedamittu samastaṃ yasmādupatiṣṭheta //	He alone that asks finds a giver; and the master, moreover, knows nothing of his dependent. But when the latter says, 'I am thy dependent: support me!' then he does know him, and feels himself bound to support him. Let him therefore approach (the fires). This then is thewhole (argument) as to why one should approach (the fires).
yāvata īṣṭe yāvadenamanu tasya retaḥ siñcati yadagnihotraṃ juhotīdamevaitatsarvamupatiṣṭhamāno 'nuvikarotīdaṃ sarvamanuprajanayati //	Now that (fire) being Pragâpati,--when the Agnihotra is offered, he casts the seed of all that he rules over, of all that is after his manner: and by approaching (the fire) one imitates (him in) all this, one reproduces all this .

Now the word 'upon' means this (earth), and that in a twofold way: for whatever is produced here, that is produced upon (upa-gan) this (earth); and whatever decays, that is buried (upa-vap ) in this (earth): hence there is here imperishable, ever-increasing abundance, and with that imperishable abundance he begins.

'--Let us offer prayer to Agni--,' for he is indeed about to offer prayer to him; '--to him who hears us even from afar!' thereby he means to say, 'Although thou art afar from us, yet do thou hear this our (prayer), do thou so far think well of it!'

He thereby follows (and praises) him:--even as a supplicant would speak politely, 'Surely thou art the descendant of so and so! surely thou art able to do this!' so (he does) by this (verse).

Indra, doubtless, is the same as that burning (sun); when he sets, then he enters the Âhavanîya;--hence he now approaches these two that are thus united, thinking, 'May the two, united, grant me favours:' this is why the Indra-Agni (verse is muttered).

And what he (Agni) really is, as such he speaks of him when he says 'spreading from house to house,' for he does indeed spread from house to house.

The richest of gifts, indeed, is the hundredfold gift; and in order to obtain that (giver) he says, 'the wise one that giveth a hundredfold.'
tadetatsamāhāryaṃ ṣaḍṛcam /	This is a hymn of six verses collected (from the Rik); the first of them containing (the word) 'upon,' and the last containing (the word) 'old' (pratna).
tasyopavatī prathamā pratnavatyuttamāvocāma tadyasmādupavatyathāda eva pratnaṃ yāvanto hyeva sanāgre devāstāvanta eva devāstasmādadaḥ pratnaṃ tadime evāntareṇa sarve kāmāste asmā ime saṃjānāne sarvān kāmāntsaṃnamataḥ //	And this we recited, because she (the earth) is the one that contains the (word) 'upon;' and that which is 'old' doubtless is yonder (sky), for as many gods as there were 'of old,' in the beginning, so many gods there are now, and hence the 'old' means yonder (sky). Now within these two (worlds) all desires are contained; and these two are in accord with each other for his (the sacrificer's) benefit, and concede all his wishes.
sa vai triḥ prathamāṃ japati / triruttamāṃ trivṛtprāyaṇā hi yajñāstrivṛdudayanāstasmāttriḥ prathamāṃ japati triruttamām //	Thrice he mutters the first (verse) and thrice the last; for of threefold beginning are sacrifices, and of threefold termination: therefore he mutters thrice the first and the last (verses).
yaddha vā atrāgnihotraṃ juhvat / vādyena vā karmaṇā vā mithyā karotyātmanastadavadyatyāyuṣo vā varcaso vā prajāyai vā //	Now, in offering the Agnihotra, whatever mistake one commits, either in word or deed, thereby he injures either his own body, or his life, or his vigour, or his offspring.
tadu khalu tanūpā agne 'si / tanvaṃ me pāhyāyurdā agne 'syāyurme dehi varcodā agne 'si varco me dehi agne yanme tanvā ūnaṃ tanma āpraṇeti //	Accordingly , 'Thou, O Agni, art the protector of bodies: protect my body!

'--We, the vigorous--thee, the invigorating; we, the strong--thee, the giver of strength--;' whereby he says, 'may we be vigorous, mayest thou be invigorating! may we be strong, mayest thou be a giver of strength!' '--We, the uninjured--thee, the uninjurable injurer of enemies!' whereby he says, 'by thine aid may we render our enemies utterly miserable!'

She that is rich in lights (kitrâvasu) doubtless is the night, since the latter, as it were, rests (vas) after gathering together the lights (kitrâ): hence (at night) one does not see clearly (kitram) from afar.

'--May I attain to long life, to lustre, to offspring, to increase of wealth!' whereby he says, 'Even as thou didst attain to those (qualities), so may I attain to long life, lustre, offspring, affluence,--that is to say, to prosperity.'

'Ye prosperous ones, disport yourselves--;' cattle are prosperous: therefore he says, 'ye prosperous ones, disport yourselves--;' '--in this seat, in this fold, in this place, in this homestead: remain here, go not from hence!' this he says with reference to himself,--'go not away from me!'

atha gārhapatyamabhyaiti / sa gārhapatyamupatiṣṭhata upa tvāgne dive dive doṣāvastardhiyā vayam namo bharanta emasīti nama evāsmā etatkaroti yathainaṃ na hiṃsyāt //	He then steps up to the Gârhapatya, and renders homage to it, with the text , 'Thee, O Agni, illuminer of the night , we approach day by day with prayer, paying homage unto thee.' He thus renders homage to it in order that it may not injure him.

And when he approaches the Gârhapatya,he prays for men: hence the first tristich is in the gâyatrî metre, since the gâyatrî is Agni's metre, and he thus approaches him with his own metre.
atha dvipadāḥ /	Thereupon (he mutters) the dvipadâ (two-footed) verses.

And whosoever, knowing this, approaches (the two fires), becomes possessed both of cattle and men.

O Aditi, come hither!' for both Idâ and Aditi are cows. He touches her with, 'Come hither, ye much-desired!'--for men's wishes are fixed on them, and hence he says, 'come hither, ye much-desired;'--'Let there be for me the fulfilment of wishes from you!' whereby he says, 'may I be dear to you!'

Hereby now (he approaches) the ether, that being Brihaspati's region; and that region he thereby approaches: this is why he mutters the prayer to Brihaspati.

For the wicked enemy lords it not over them (that are protected by these gods), neither at home nor on dangerous paths: for those sons of Aditi bestow undying light on the mortal that he may live!'--In this (prayer) he says, 'nor on dangerous paths;' for dangerous indeed are the paths that lie between heaven and earth: those he now walks, and therefore he says, 'nor on dangerous paths.'

The worshippers, doubtless, arethe sacrificers; and what unassailable chariot he (Agni) possesses, therewith he protects the sacrificers. Hence he thereby means to say, 'what unassailable chariot thou possessest, wherewith thou protectest the sacrificers, therewith do thou guard us on every side.' This (verse) he mutters thrice.
atha putrasya nāma gṛhṇāti / idam me 'yaṃ vīryaṃ putro 'nusaṃtanavaditi yadi putro na syādapyātmana eva nāma gṛhṇīyāt //	He then pronounces his son's name : 'May this son (N.N.) carry on this manly deed of mine!' Should he have no son, let him insert his own name.

In saying 'Earth! ether! sky!' he renders his speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that (speech) thus rendered propitious he invokes a blessing:--'May I be well supplied with offspring!' whereby he prays for offspring; '--well supplied with men!' whereby he prays for men (heroes); '--well supplied with viands!' whereby he prays for prosperity.
āśīreva sāśīriyaṃ tadetāvataivaitatsarvamāpnoti tasmādetenaivopatiṣṭhetaitena nveva vayamupacarāma iti ha smāhāsuriḥ //	That long (form of) fire-worship is a prayer for blessing, and so is this (short) one a prayer for blessing: hence even with this much he obtains all, and he may therefore worship the fires with it. 'Therewith, indeed, we perform,' so spake Âsuri.
atha pravatsyan / gārhapatyamevāgra upatiṣṭhate 'thāhavanīyaṃ //	Now, when he is about to set out on a journey , he approaches first the Gârhapatya, and thereupon the Âhavanîya.
sa gārhapatyamupatiṣṭhate / narya prajām me pāhīti prajāyā haiṣa īṣṭe tatprajāmevāsmā etatparidadāti guptyai //	The Gârhapatya he approaches with the text , 'Thou, that art friendly to man, protect my offspring!' He (Agni Gârhapatya), truly, is the guardian of offspring; and therefore he now makes over to him his offspring for protection.
athāhavanīyamupatiṣṭhate / śaṃsya paśūnme pāhīti paśūnāṃ haiṣa īṣṭe tatpaśūnevāsmā etatparidadāti guptyai //	He then approaches the Âhavanîya, with 'Thou, that art worthy of praise, protect my cattle!' He (Agni), truly, is the guardian of cattle, and therefore he now makes over to him his cattle for protection .
atha pra vā vrajati pra vā dhāvayati /	Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers to be the boundary , he breaks silence.

And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him (or any other person before one has rendered homage to the fires).
sa āhavanīyamevāgra upatiṣṭhate /	He first approaches the Âhavanîya fire, and thereupon the Gârhapatya.
atha gārhapatyaṃ gṛhā vai gārhapatyo gṛhā vai pratiṣṭhā tadgṛheṣvevaitatpratiṣṭhāyām pratitiṣṭhati //	The Gârhapatya doubtless is a house (grihâh), and a house is a safe resting-place: so that he thereby (finally ) establishes himself in a house, that is, in a safe resting-place.
sa āhavanīyamupatiṣṭhate / āganma viśvavedasamasmabhyaṃ vasuvittamam agne samrāḍabhi dyumnamabhi saha āyacasvetyathopaviśya tṛṇānyapalumpati //	He approaches the Âhavanîya fire, with the text , 'We have approached (thee), the all-knowing, the most liberal dispenser ofgoods: O Agni, sovereign lord, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down he sweeps the blades of grass (into the fire).
atha gārhapatyamupatiṣṭhate / ayamagnirgṛhapatirgārhapatyaḥprajāyā vasuvittamaḥ agne gṛhapate 'bhi dyumnamabhi saha āyacasvetyathopaviśya tṛṇānyapalumpatyetannu japenaitena nveva bhūyiṣṭhā ivopatiṣṭhante //	Thereupon he approaches the Gârhapatya, with the text, 'He, Agni Gârhapatya, is the lord of the house, the most liberal dispenser of goods to our offspring: O Agni, lord of the house, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down, he sweeps off the blades of grass.
sa vai khalu tūṣṇīmevopatiṣṭheta /	In this way (householders) mostly approach the fires with muttered prayer.

Now in this (sacrificial ground) one's betters indeed reside, viz. the divine Agnis: who, then, would dare to say to them, 'I am going on a journey, take ye care of this (property) of mine!'
mano ha vai devā manuṣyasyājānanti / sa veda gārhapatyaḥ paridām medamupāgāditi tūṣṇīmevāhavanīyamupatiṣṭhate sa vedāhavanīyaḥ paridāṃ medamupāgāditi //	The gods assuredly see through the mind of man: that (Agni) Gârhapatya therefore knows that he (the householder) now approaches in order to givehimself up to him. Silently he approaches the Âhavanîya fire: that (Agni) Âhavanîya knows that he now approaches in order to give himself up to him.
atha pra vā vrajati pra vā dhāvayati / sa yatra velo manyate tatsyanttvā vācaṃ visṛjate 'tha proṣya parekṣya yatra velām manyate tadvācaṃ yacati sa yadyapi rājāntareṇa syānnaiva tamupeyāt //	Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers the boundary line, he releases his speech. And when he returns from the journey, he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him.

Silently he approaches the Âhavanîya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades. Silently he approaches the Gârhapatya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades.
athāto gṛhāṇāmevopacāraḥ /	Then as to the observances in regard to (the entering of) his house.

It is therefore for fear of him that speaks or does anything on this occasion that the house trembles and is liable to crush his family; but him who neither speaks nor does anything, his house receives with confidence, thinking, 'He has not spoken here, he has not done anything here!' And should he be ever so angry at anything on this occasion, let him rather do on the next day whatever he might wish to say or do. This then is the observance in regard to the house .
prajāpatiṃ vai bhūtānyupāsīdan / prajā vai bhūtāni vi no dhehi yathā jīvāmeti tato devā yajñopavītino bhūtvā dakṣiṇaṃ jānvācyopāsīdaṃstānabravīdyajño vo 'nnamamṛtatvaṃ va ūrgvaḥ sūryo vo jyotiriti //	Now the living beings once approached Pragâpati--beings doubtless mean creatures--and said, 'Ordain unto us in what manner we are to live!' Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial cord and bending the right knee, approached him. To them he said, 'The sacrifice (shall be) your food; immortality your sap; and the sun your light!'
athainam pitaraḥ / prācīnāvītinaḥ savyaṃ jānvācyopāsīdaṃstānabravīnmāsimāsi vo 'śanaṃ svadhā vo manojavīvaścandramā vo jyotiriti //	Then the fathers approached, wearing the cord on the right shoulder, and bending the left knee. To them he said, 'Your eating (shall be) monthly; your cordial (svadhâ) your swiftness of thought; and the moon your light!'
athainam manuṣyāḥ /	Then the men approached him, clothed and bending their bodies.
prāvṛtā upasthaṃ kṛtvopāsīdaṃstānabravītsāyam prātarvo 'śanam prajā vo mṛtyurvo 'gnirvo jyotiriti //	To them he said, 'Your eating (shall be) in the evening and in the morning; your offspring your death; and the fire (Agni) your light!'
athainam paśava upāsīdan /	Then the beasts approached him.
tebhyaḥ svaiṣameva cakāra yadaiva yūyaṃ kadā ca labhādhvai yadi kāle yadyanākāle 'thaivāśnātheti tasmādete yadaiva kadā ca labhante yadi kāle yadyanākāle 'thaivāśnanti //	To them he granted their own choice, saying, 'Whensoever ye shall find anything, whether in season or out of season,ye shall eat it!' Hence whenever they find anything, whether in season or out of season, they eat it.
atha hainaṃ śaśvadapyasurā upasedurityāhuḥ /	Thereupon--so they say--the Asuras also straightway approached him.
tebhyastamaśca māyāṃ ca pradadāvastyahaivāsuramāyetīva parābhūtā ha tveva tāḥ prajāstā imāḥ prajāstathaivopajīvanti yathaivābhyaḥ prajāpatirvyadadhāt //	To them he gave darkness (tamas) and illusion (mâyâ): for there is indeed what is called the illusion of the Asuras. Those creatures, it is true, have perished; but creatures still subsist here in the very manner which Pragâpati ordained unto them.
naiva devā atikrāmanti / na pitaro na paśavo manuṣyā evaike 'tikrāmanti tasmādyo manuṣyāṇām medyatyaśubhe medyati vihūrcati hi na hyayanāya cana bhavatyanṛtaṃ hi kṛtvā medyati tasmādu sāyamprātarāśyeva syātsa yo haivaṃ vidvāntsāyamprātarāśī bhavati sarvaṃ haivāyureti yadu ha kiṃ ca vācā vyāharati tadu haiva bhavatyetaddhi devasatyaṃ gopāyati taddhaitattejo nāma brāhmaṇaṃ ya etasya vrataṃ śaknoti caritum //	Neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor beasts transgress (this ordinance); some of the men alone transgress it. Hence whatever man grows fat; he grows fat in unrighteousness, since he totters and is unable to walk because of his having grown fat by doing wrong. One should therefore eat only in the evening and morning; and whosoever, knowing this, eats only in the evening and morning, reaches the full measure of life; and whatever he speaks, that is (true); because he observes that divine truth. For, verily, that is Brâhmanic lustre (tegas), when one knows to keep His (Pragâpati's) law.
māsi māsyeva pitṛbhyo dadato yadaivaiṣa na purastānna paścāddadṛśe 'thaibhyo dadātyeṣa vai somo rājā devānāmannaṃ yaccandramāḥ sa etāṃ rātriṃ kṣīyate tasminkṣīṇe dadāti tathaibhyo samadaṃ karotyatha yadakṣīṇe dadyātsamadaṃ ha kuryāddevebhyaśca pitṛbhyaśca tasmādyadaivaiṣa na purastānna paścāddadṛśe 'thaibhyo dadāti //	Now that (lustre) indeed belongs to him who presents (food) to the fathers once a month. When that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he presents (food) to them; for that moon doubtless is king Soma, the food of the gods. Now during that night (of new moon) it fails them, and when it fails, he presents (food to them), and thereby establishes concord (between the gods and fathers). But were he to present (food) to them when it is not failing, he would indeed cause a quarrel between the gods and fathers: hence he presents[paragraph continues] (food) to them when that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west.
sa vā aparāhṇe dadāti /	He presents it in the afternoon.
pūrvāhṇo vai devānām madhyandino manuṣyāṇāmaparāhṇaḥ pitṝṇāṃ tasmādaparāhṇe dadāti //	The forenoon, doubtless, belongs to the gods; the mid-day to men; and the afternoon to the fathers: therefore he presents (food to the fathers) in the afternoon.

Thereupon he rises from thence and threshes (the rice) while standing north of the Dakshina fire and facing the south. Only once he cleans (the rice) ; for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away, and therefore he cleans it only once.
taṃ śrapayati /	He then boils it.
tasminnadhiśrita ājyam pratyānayatyagnau vai devebhyo juhvatyuddharanti manuṣyebhyo 'thaiva pitṝṇāṃ tasmādadhiśrita ājyam pratyānayati //	While it stands on the (Dakshina) fire, he pours some clarified butter on it;--for the gods they pour the offering into the fire; for men they take (the food) off the fire; and for the fathers they do in this very manner: hence, they pour the ghee on it while it stands on the fire.
sa udvāsyāgnau dve āhutī juhoti devebhyaḥ /	After removing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two libations in the fire.
devānvā eṣa upāvartate ya āhitāgnirbhavati yo darśapūrṇamāsābhyāṃ yajate 'thaitatpitṛyajñenevācārīttadu nihnute sa devaiḥ prasūto 'thaitatpitṛbhyo dadāti tasmādudvāsyāgnau dve āhutī juhoti devebhyaḥ //	For, in establishing his sacrificial fires, and in performing the new and full-moon sacrifice, that (householder) resorts to the gods. Here, however, he is engaged in asacrifice to the fathers: hence he thereby propitiates the gods, and being permitted by the gods, he presents that (food) to the fathers. This is why, on removing (the rice), he offers to the gods two libations in the fire.
sa vā agnaye ca somāya ca juhoti /	He offers both to Agni and Soma .
sa yadagnaye juhoti sarvatra hyevāgniranvābhakto 'tha yatsomāya juhoti pitṛdevatyo vai somastasmādagnaye ca somāya ca juhoti //	To Agni he offers, because Agni is allowed a share in every (offering); and to Soma he offers, because Soma is sacred to the fathers. This is why he offers both to Agni and Soma.
agnaye kavyavāhanāya svāhā somāya pitṛmate svāhetyagnau mekṣaṇamabhyādadhāti tatsviṣṭakṛdbhājanamatha dakṣiṇenānvāhāryapacanaṃ sakṛdullikhati tadvedibhājanaṃ sakṛdu hyeva parāñcaḥ pitarastasmātsakṛdullikhati //	He offers with the formulas , 'To Agni, the bearer of what is meet for the wise, svâhâ!' 'To Soma, accompanied by the fathers, svâhâ !' He then puts the pot-ladle on the fire,--that being in lieu of the Svishtakrit . Thereupon he draws (with the wooden sword) one line (furrow) south of the Dakshina fire ,--thatbeing in lieu of the altar: only one line he draws, because the fathers have passed away once for all.
atha parastādulmukaṃ nidadhāti /	He then lays down a firebrand at the farther (south) end (of the line).
sa yadanidhāyolmukamathaitatpitṛbhyo dadyādasurarakṣasāni haiṣāmetadvimathnīraṃstatho haitatpitṝṇāmasurarakṣasāni na vimathnate tasmātparastādulmukaṃ nidadhāti //	For were he to present that (food) to the fathers, without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Rakshas would certainly tamper with it. And thus the Asuras and Rakshas do not tamper with that (food) of the fathers: this is why he lays down the firebrand at the farther end (of the line).
ye rūpāṇi pratimuñcamānā asurāḥ santaḥ svadhayā caranti parāpuro nipuro ye bharantyagniṣṭāṃlokātpraṇudātyasmādityagnirhi rakṣasāmapahantā tasmādevaṃ nidadhāti //	He lays it down, with the text , 'Whatsoever Asuras roam about at will , assuming various shapes ,--be they large-bodied or small-bodied ,--may Agni expel them from this world!' Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas, and therefore he lays (the firebrand) down in this way.
athodapātramādāyāvanejayati / asāvavanenikṣvetyeva yajamānasya pitaramasāvavanenikṣveti pitāmahamasāvavanenikṣveti prapitāmahaṃ tadyathāśiṣyate 'bhiṣiñcedevaṃ tat //	He then takes the water-pitcher and makes (the fathers) wash (their hands ) , merely saying, 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case.
agramiva vai devānām madhyamiva manuṣyāṇām mūlamiva pitṝṇāṃ tasmādupamūlaṃ dināni bhavanti sakṛdācinnāni bhavanti sakṛdu hyevaparāñcaḥ pitarastasmātsakṛdācinnāni bhavanti //	Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one stroke, and cut off near the root;--the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men, and the root-part to the fathers: therefore they are cut off near the root. And with one stroke they are severed, because the fathers have passed away once for all.
tāni dakṣiṇopastṛṇāti /	He spreads them (along the line) with their tops towards the south.
tatra dadāti sa vā iti dadātītīva vai devebhyo juhvatyuddharanti manuṣyebhyo 'thaivaṃ pitṝṇāṃ tasmāditi dadāti //	He presents them thus ;--for to the gods they offer thus; for men they ladle out (the food in any way they please) ; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way: therefore he presents (the cakes to them) thus.
sa dadāti /	With, 'N.N., this for thee!' he presents (one cake) to the sacrificer's father.

He presents (the food) in an order (directed) away from the present time, because it is away from hence that the fathers have once for all departed.
atra pitaro mādayadhvaṃ yathābhāgamāvṛṣāyadhvvamiti yathābhāgamaśnītetyevaitadāha //	He then mutters , 'Here, O fathers, regale yourselves: like bulls come hither, each to his own share!' whereby he says, 'Eat ye each his own share!'
atha parāṅ paryāvartate / tira iva vai pitaro manuṣyebhyastira ivaitadbhavati sa vā ā tamitorāsītetyāhuretāvānhyasuriti sa vai muhūrtamevāsitvā //	He then turns round (to the left), so as to face the opposite (north) side: for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers).
athopapalyayya japati / amīmadanta pitaro yathābhāgamāvṛṣāyiṣateti yathābhāgamāśiṣurityevaitadāha //	He again turns round (to the right) and mutters , 'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they have come each to his own share;' whereby he means to say, 'They have eaten each his own share .'
athodapātramādāyāvanejayati /	He then pulls down the tuck (of the sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance.
asāvavanenikṣvetyeva yajamānasya pitaramasāvavanenikṣveti pitāmahamasāvavanenikṣveti prapitāmahaṃ tadyathā jakṣuṣe 'bhiṣiñcedevaṃ tat //	The tuck is sacred to the fathers (pitridevatyâ): therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck. Now obeisance means worship (or sacrifice): hence he thereby renders them worthy of worship.

He mutters , 'Give us houses, O fathers!' for the fathers are the guardians (îsate) of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacrificial performance. After the cakes have been put back (in the dish containing the remains of boiled rice) he (the sacrificer) smells at (the rice); this (smelling) being the sacrificer's share.

'That is why the offering of first-fruits is performed.'

The Asuras then defiled, partly by magic, partly with poison, both kinds of plants--those on which men and beasts subsist--hoping that in this way they might over come the gods. In consequence of this neither did men eat food, nor did beasts graze; and from want of food these creatures well-nigh perished .
tadvai devāḥ śuśruvuḥ /	Now the gods heard as to how these creatures were perishing from want of food.

By means of the sacrifice the gods then accomplished all that they wanted to accomplish ; and so did the Rishis.

They did not agree (each of them exclaiming), 'Mine (it shall be)!' Not having come to an agreement, they said, 'Let us run a race for this (sacrifice): whichever of us beats (the others), his it shall be!' 'So be it!' they said, and they ran a race.

And where Indra and Agni were standing when they had won, thither all the gods followed them.

Nevertheless let both (the cake and karu) consist of new (grain); for (by the very fact that) the one is a cake and the other a pap, the nobility is not equalled (by the people): hence they should both consist of new (grain).

They accordingly assigned that share to them, to wit, the cake on one potsherd offered to heavenand earth . This is why there is a cake on one potsherd (kapâla) for heaven and earth. Now this (earth) is, doubtless, the cup (depository, kapâla) of that (sap) ; and she indeed is one only: hence (the cake) consists of one potsherd.

But that (cake) he offers entire, and he does not cut off a portion for the Svishtakrit this is an offence, and consequently (that cake), when offered, turns upside down.

No offence (is, however, committed) by him, for the Âhavanîya is the support of oblations; and if, after reaching the Âhavanîya, (the cake) were to turn upside down ten times, he need not heed it. And if others ask as to who would care to incur (the result of) such a combination (of errors), let him offer nothing but butter; for clarified butter is manifestly the sap ofthose two, heaven and earth, so that he thereby manifestly gladdens those two with their own sap or essence: hence he need offer nothing but butter.

And whatever share the gods assigned (to themselves), that share he thereby makes over to them. Moreover, he thereby renders wholesome and faultless both kinds of plants,--those on which men and beasts subsist; and these creatures subsist on those wholesome and faultless (plants) of his: this is why he performs that sacrifice.
tasya prathamajo gaurdakṣiṇā /	The priests' fee for this (sacrifice) consists of the first-born calf (of the season); for that is, as it were, the first-fruits (of the cattle).

If, on the other hand, he has not yet performed (the new and full-moon offerings), let them cook a kâtushprâsya pap on the southern fire, and let the priests eat it.
dvayā vai devā devāḥ /	Verily, there are two kinds of gods: for the gods themselves, assuredly, are gods; and those priests who have studied, and teach Vedic lore, are the human gods.

The Âgrayana is one thing, and the Agnihotra is another: let him, therefore, not offer (new material) at the Agnihotra. Here also two days were, as a rule, required for the performance, both at full and new moon; but while, at the ordinary sacrifice,At full moon some authorities add a special ishti to Indra Vimridh ('the Averter of evil').
prajākāmo bahuḥ prajayā paśubhiḥ syāṃ śriyaṃ gaceyaṃ yaśaḥ syāmannādaḥ syāmiti //	In the beginning Pragâpati, being desirous of offspring, sacrificed with this sacrifice: 'May I abound in offspring and cattle; may I obtain prosperity; may I become glorious; may I become an eater of food!' so he thought.

Some, however, call it the Vasishtha-sacrifice; for he (Pragâpati) is indeed vasishtha (the best) , and after him they call it. He sacrificed with that sacrifice; and what race, what prosperity of Pragâpati was then produced through his performing that sacrifice, that same race he procreates, that same prosperity he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him therefore perform that sacrifice.

Now they knew that he was coming to them after studying the sacrifice for their sake. They said, 'Verily, with the gods (saha devaih) he has come to us who has come after studying the sacrifice:' thus he (was called) Sahadeva Sârñgaya; and even now the saying is, 'Lo, Suplan has taken another name!' He performed that sacrifice; and what race and prosperity of the Sriñgayas was then produced through his performing that sacrifice, that same race he procreates, that same prosperity he obtains, whosoever,knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice. That same sacrifice was afterwards performed by Devabhâga Srautarsha.

A very high position accordingly he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice.

He offers on two days of the full moon and on two of the new moon: for two means a pair, so that a productive pair is thereby obtained.

Then those two, Mitra and Varuna, are two deities, and two means a pair: hence a productive pair is thereby obtained; and thus is (produced) that form (of the sacrifice) whereby he becomes many, whereby he is reproduced.

Now Agni's cake is for him what the morning libation is (at the Soma-sacrifice), for the morning libation is indeed sacred to Agni; and the Sânnâyya is for him the mid-day libation, for the mid-day libation is indeed sacred to Indra.

And again when, at full moon, he offers the Agni-Soma (cake) on the first day,--it was by that (offering) that Indra slew Vritra ; it was thereby he gained that supreme authority which he now wields : and so does he (the sacrificer) thereby slay his wicked spiteful enemy and gain the superiority. And as to his mixing (sweet and sour milk),--the Sânnâyya is (the oblation) of the new moon (amâ-vâsyâ) , and the new moon means being far away: to him who had slain Vritra this was forthwith (offered), and him they regaled with that draught. He therefore who, knowing this, prepares the Sânnâyya at full moon, forthwithdrives away evil.

Whosoever, then, knowing this, prepares the Sânnâyya at full moon, renders his offering palatable to the gods, and his offering is palatable to the gods.

Now Agni's cake is (offered) for the sole purpose that it may not forsake the sacrifice. Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna, and the waning one is Mitra. During that night (of new moon) these two meet, and when they are thus together he pleases them with that (cake-offering): and, verily, all is pleased with him, all is obtained by him who thus knows this.

Having collected that (Soma or moon) from the waters and plants, he causes him to be born from out of the oblations; and on being born from the oblations, he is visible in the western (sky).
mithunādidvā enametatprajanayati /	It is through union that he produces him: the curds (payasyâ, fem.) are female, and the whey is seed.

The sacrificer partakes of it first, thinking, 'May I first obtain seed!' But also last (he partakes of it) , thinking, 'May seed remain in me last of all!' By saying, 'Invited,--invite thou !' they make it (the whey to resemble) the Soma.

He created a second (race of beings); they also passed away: they are those small crawling reptiles other than snakes. He created a third (race), they say; they also passed away: they are those snakes. Yâgñavalkya, on his part, declared them to be of two kinds only; but of three kinds they are according to the Rik.

He then became aware that his creatures passed away from want of food. He made the breasts in the fore-part of (their) body teem with milk. He then created living beings; and by resorting to the breasts, the beings created by him thenceforward continued to exist: they are these (creatures) which have not passed away.

And in like manner as Pragâpati created these living beings, so they are propagated: for whenever the breasts of woman and the udder of cattle swell, then whatever is born is born; and by resorting to the breasts these (beings) continue to exist. Now that milk is indeed food; for in the beginning Pragâpati produced it for food.

And those who have no milk are nursed by the former as soon as they are born; and thus they exist by means of food, and hence food means progeny.
sa yaḥ prajākāmaḥ / etena haviṣā yajata ātmānamevaitadyajñaṃ vidhatte prajāpatim bhūtam //	He who is desirous of offspring, sacrifices with that oblation, and thereby makes himself the sacrifice, which is Pragâpati .

agnirvai devatānām mukham prajanayitā sa prajāpatistasmādāgneyo bhavati //	Agni indeed is the root, the progenitor of the deities; he is Pragâpati ('lord of creatures'): hence there is a cake for Agni.
atha saumyaścarurbhavati /	Then follows a potful of boiled rice (karu) for Soma.
reto vai somastadagnau prajanayitari somaṃ retaḥ siñcati tatpurastānmithunam prajananam //	Soma doubtless is seed, and that in Agni, the progenitor; he (Agni) casts the seed Soma: thus there is at the outset a productive union.

Savitri indeed is the impeller (pra-savitri) of the gods; he is Pragâpati, the intermediate progenitor: hence the cake to Savitri.
atha sārasvataścarurbhavati /	Then follows a potful of boiled rice for Sarasvatî; and another for Pûshan.

Through that twofold productive union Pragâpati created the living beings,--through the one (he created) the upright, and through the other those looking to the ground.
athātaḥ payasyāyā evāyatanam /	This is why there are these five oblations .

The Maruts indeed are the people (visah), the people of the gods.

He accordingly set aside for them that share, the Maruts' cake on seven potsherds; and that is this same cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts. The reason why it is one of seven potsherds, is that the host of the Maruts is (distributed in troops) of seven each . This is why there is a cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts.
taṃ vai svatavobhya iti kuryāt /	Let him offer it to the 'self-strong' (Maruts); since they gained that share for themselves.
svayaṃ hi ta etam bhāgamakurvatoto svatavobhyo yājyānuvākye na vindanti sa u khalu māruta eva syātsa vā eṣa prajābhya evāhiṃsāyai kriyate tasmānmārutaḥ //	[If], however, they (the priests) do not find an invitatory and an offering prayer (addressed) to the 'self-strong' (Maruts) , let it be (offered) simply to the[paragraph continues] Maruts. It is offered for the safety of creatures: hence it is offered to the Maruts.
athātaḥ payasyaiva /	Thereupon follows the oblation of curds (payasyâ).

tasyām mithunamasti /	Therein a union takes place: the curdled milk (payasyâ, fem.) is female, and the whey is seed.
yoṣā payasyā reto vājinaṃ tasmānmithunādviśvamasammitamanu prājāyata tadyadetasmānmithunādviśvamasammitamanu prājāyata tasmādvaiśvadevī bhavati //	From that union the infinite All was gradually generated; and since the infinite All was gradually generated from that union, therefore it (the offering of curds) belongs to the All-gods.
atha dyāvāpṛthivya ekakapālaḥ puroḍāśo bhavati /	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Heaven and Earth.

And in like manner he, who by means of those oblations creates living beings, thereby encloses them within heaven and earth: this is why there is a cake on one potsherd for Heaven and Earth.
athāta āvṛdeva /	Now as to the course of proceeding.

Thereto flowering shoots (of sacrificial grass) are tied: these he uses for the prastara ; for this is a productive union, and productive indeed are flowering shoots: this is why he takes flowering shoots for the prastara.
āsādya havīṃṣyagnim manthanti /	On putting the, sacrificial dishes in their place, they churn the fire .
agniṃ ha vai jāyamānamanu prajāpateḥ prajā jajñire tatho evaitasyāgnimeva jāyamānamanu prajā jāyante tasmādāsādya havīṃṣyagnim manthanti //	For it was after Agni was born that Pragâpati's offspring was born;. and so for this (sacrificer) also offspring is born after Agni (the fire) has been produced: this is why they churn the fire, after they have deposited the sacrificial dishes in their place.
navaprayājam bhavati /	[At the Vaisvadeva-offering] there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings .

This is why (the Vaisvadeva) has nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings.
trīṇi samiṣṭayajūṃṣi bhavanti / jyāya iva hīdaṃ haviryajñādyatra navaprayājaṃ navānuyājamatho apyekameva syāddhaviryajño hi tasya prathamajo gaurdakṣiṇā //	There are three Samishtayagus ; for this (offering) is decidedly greater than an (ordinary) havir-yagña , since it has nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings. However, there may also be only a single Samishtayagus, since this is a havir-yagña.
etena vai prajāpatiḥ yajñeneṣṭvā /	The priest's fee for it (consists of) the firstborn calf (of the season).

vaiśvadevena vai prajāpatiḥ /	Now it was by means of the Vaisvadeva that Pragâpati produced living beings.

And from their eating Varuna's barley corn the name Varunapraghâsâh (is derived).

The out-breathing and in-breathing forsook them not, but all the other deities forsook them; and owing to these two, the creatures did not perish.
tadyāścaivāsya prajā jātā āsanyāścājātāstā ubhayīrvaruṇapāśātprāmuñcattā asyānamīvā akilviṣāḥ prajāḥ prājāyata //	Pragâpati healed them by means of that oblation: both the creatures that were born and those that were unborn he delivered from Varuna's noose; and his creatures were born without disease and blemish.

This is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month.
tadvai dve vedī dvāvagnī bhavataḥ /	At this (sacrifice) there are two altars and two fires .
tadyaddve vedī dvāvagnī bhavatastadubhayata evaitadvaruṇapāśātprajāḥ pramuñcatītaścordhvā itaścāvācīstasmāddve vedī dvāvagnī bhavataḥ //	The reason why there are two altars and twofires, is that thereby one frees the creatures from Varuna's noose both ways,--on the one side (he frees) the upright, and on the other those looking to the ground: this is why there are two altars and two fires.

Varuna, doubtless, is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: he thus makes the nobility superior (uttara) to the people; and hence people here serve the Kshatriya, placed above them. This is why he raises the uttara-vedi on the northern, not on the southern altar.
athaitānyeva pañca havīṃṣi bhavanti /	In the first place there are those five oblations .

athaindrāgno dvādaśakapālaḥ puroḍāśo bhavati /	Then follows a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.

Hence he now restores his creatures by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing, bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on them: this is why there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.
ubhayatra payasye bhavataḥ /	On both (fires) there is an oblation of curds.

vāruṇyuttarā bhavati /	This is why there is an oblation of curds on both (fires).

The southern one is offered to the Maruts. It is for the sake of diversity that it is offered to the Maruts; for a repetition he would undoubtedly commit, were he to offer both to Varuna. Moreover, it was from the south that the Maruts intended to slay his (Pragâpati's) creatures, and with that share he propitiated them: for this reason the southern (oblation of curds) belongs to the Maruts.
tayorubhayoreva karīrāṇyāvapati / kaṃ vai prajāpatiḥ prajābhyaḥ karīrairakuruta kamvevaiṣa etatprajābhyaḥ kurute //	Upon both (dishes of curds) he scatters karîra-fruits ; for with karîra-fruits Pragâpatibestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) thereby bestow happiness on the creatures.
śaṃ vai prajāpatiḥ prajābhyaḥ śamīpalāśairakuruta śamvevaiṣa etatprajābhyaḥ kurute //	Upon both of them he also scatters samî-leaves; for with samî-leaves Pragâpati bestowed bliss (sam) on the creatures, and so does he now thereby bestow bliss on the creatures.

They are made of barley, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten barley that Varuna seized them. A pair they form, so that hedelivers the creatures from Varuna's noose through conjugal union.
sa uttarasyāmeva payasyāyām meṣīmavadadhāti / dakṣiṇasyām meṣamevamiva hi mithunaṃ kLptamuttarato hi strī pumāṃsamupaśete //	The ewe he places on the southern, and the ram on the northern dish of curds; for in this way alone a proper union is effected, since the woman lies on the left (or north) side of the man.
uttarasyāṃ vedāvāsādayatyathaitāmeva payasyām pratiprasthātā dakṣiṇasyāṃ vedāvāsādayati //	The Adhvaryu places all the (other) sacrificial dishes upon the northern altar; and the Pratiprasthâtri places on the southern altar that dish of curds (belonging to the Maruts).

Both (the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthâtri) then put firewood on (the fire) and both reserve one kindling-stick each; and they both pour out the first libation (âghâra). Thereupon the Adhvaryu says, 'Agnîdh, trim the fire!' Although the summons is given, the trimming does not take place (immediately)
atha pratiprasthātā pratiparaiti /	Thereupon the Pratiprasthâtri returns (to where the sacrificer's wife is seated).

Now when a woman who belongs to one (man) carries on intercourse with another, she undoubtedly commits (a sin) against Varuna. He therefore thus asks her, lest she should sacrifice with a secret pang in her mind; for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it becomes truth; this is why he thus asks her. And whatever (connection) she confesses not, that indeed will turn out injurious to her relatives.
tāṃ vācayati / praghāsino havāmahe marutaśca riśādasaḥ karambheṇa sajoṣasa iti yathā puro 'nuvākyaivameṣaitayaivainānetebhyaḥ pātrebhyo hvayati //	He then makes her say the text , 'We invoke the Maruts, the voracious consumers of enemies, delighting in their porridge.' This (verse) is (of like import) as the invitatory prayer she therewith invites them to these dishes .

There being one for each descendant, he thereby delivers from Varuna's noose one by one the children born to him; and there being an additional one, he thereby delivers from Varuna'snoose those children of his that are as yet unborn: this is why there are (the same number of dishes) exceeded by one. (In the form of) dishes they are, because it is from dishes that food is eaten; and of barley they are prepared, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten the barley corn that Varuna seized them.
purā yajñātpurāhutibhyo juhoti /	From the winnowing basket she offers, because food is prepared by means of the winnowing basket.

She offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the oblations, since the people do not eat offerings, and the Maruts are the people. Now when Pragâpati's creatures, being seized by Varuna, became rent all over, and sat and lay them down, breathing in and breathing out, then the Maruts destroyed their sin; and so do the Maruts now destroy the sin of his (the sacrificer's) offspring.

'Having done the work for the gods;'--for the gods indeed they have done the work; 'go home, ye companions!'--they are now together with her while she is led thither from an other place: hence she says, 'ye companions' (sakâbhû, 'being together'). 'Go home,' she says, because that wife doubtless is the hind part of the sacrifice, and he has just now made her take her seat to the east of the sacrifice. 'Home' doubtless means the house, and the house is a resting-place: hence he thereby makes her rest in that resting-place, the house.

Being thus urged to proceed, they both take up the spoons and step across (to the south side of the fires). After stepping across and calling for the 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer on the kindling-sticks!' and 'Pronounce the offering-prayer!' at each (subsequent fore-offering). Pouring (the butter in the spoons) together (into the guhû) at the fourth , they both proceed with the nine fore-offerings .

Having stepped across and called for the 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Soma!' After the 'Vashat' has been uttered, they both pour out the oblation.

Now as to why the Adhvaryu alone calls for the 'Sraushat.' Here indeed when the 'Vashat' is pronounced,
kṛtānukara eva pratiprasthātā /	The Pratiprasthâtri is merely the imitator of what is done (by the Adhvaryu).

But were the Pratiprasthâtri also to call for the 'Sraushat,' he would doubtless make the people equal in power to the nobility: for this reason the Pratiprasthâtri does not call for the 'Sraushat.'

Thereupon, being about to proceed with those two oblations of curds, (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) exchange (the ram and ewe): the ram which was on the Maruts' (dish of curds) he (the Adhvaryu) places on that of Varuna; and the ewe which was on Varuna's (dish of curds) he (the Pratiprasthâtri) places on that of the Maruts.

The female, on the other hand, is without energy; and the Maruts are the people: hence they thereby cause the people to be without energy.

The Adhvaryu now says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Varuna!' He then pours an 'under-layer' of butter (into the guhû), takes two cuttings from Varuna's curds, and with either of the two cuttings puts the rant (in the spoon).

The Adhvaryu then takes cuttings from all (his) oblations, one from each; and the Pratiprasthâtri also takes one cutting from that oblation of curds (to the Maruts). They then pour twice butter upon (the portions), and step across (to the south side of the fires). On stepping across and calling for the 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svishtakrit; and after the (concluding) 'Vashat,' they both pour out the oblation."

Thus they both perform the nine after-offerings , pouring together (the butter from the spoons) at the (or at every) fourth after-offering. The reason why there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings, is that he thereby delivers the creatures both times from Varuna's noose,--by the former (he delivers) the upright and by the latter those looking to the ground: for this reason there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings.

They both throw the enclosing-sticks (into the fire); and after taking up the spoons together, they both place them on the wooden sword ."

They now take (the havis) mixed with the burnt scrapings of the Varuna curds, and betake themselves to (the place of) the expiatory bath (avabhritha). This (ablution) stands in relation to Varuna, (being performed) with a view to deliverance from Varuna's power. No Sâman-hymn is sung on this occasion, for at this (sacrifice) nothing whatever is performed with a Sâman-hymn.

Having gone to the house and 'churned out' the fires, he performs the full-moon offering. These seasonal offerings doubtless are detached sacrifices; whereas the full-moon offering is a regular, established sacrifice: hence he finally establishes himself by means of that regular sacrifice; and therefore he changes his place (to the ordinary sacrificial ground).

Now with these Sâkamedha offerings,--therewith indeed the gods slew Vritra, therewith they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he now therewith slay his wicked, spiteful enemy and gain the victory: this is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Varunapraghâsâh). He performs them on two successive days.

For it was aftershaping Agni into a sharp point , that the gods rushed forward, intent on slaying Vritra; and that sharp point, Agni, swerved not. And so does he (the Sacrificer) now rush forward, after shaping Agni into a sharp point, intent on slaying his wicked, spiteful enemy; and that sharp point, Agni, swerves not: this is why he sacrifices to Agni Anîkavat.

And so do the scorching winds scorch his (the Sacrificer's) wicked, spiteful enemy: hence (he sacrifices) to the Maruts, the Scorchers.

Now, whenever (in preparing the pap) they use (whole) rice-grains, then that is a karu: this nourishment the gods took when they were about to slay Vritra on the morrow; and so does he (the Sacrificer) now take that nourishment, being about to slay his wicked, spiteful enemy. The reason, then, why it is milk-pap, is that milk is nourishment, and rice-grains are nourishment, and that he thus puts into him (âtman) that twofold nourishment. For this reason it is a rice-pap (prepared) with milk.

Having steppedacross, and called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-formula to Soma!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

He then makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the guhû), takes two cuttings from that pap, pours some butter thereon, re-anoints (replenishes with butter the parts of the sacrificial dish from which he has made) the two cuttings, and steps across (to the offering-place).

He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes one cutting from the pap, pours twice butter thereon, without, however, re-anointing the (place of the) cutting; and steps across. Having stepped across, and called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svishtakrit!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

As many members of (the sacrificer's) household as are entitled to partake of the remains of sacrificialfood may eat (of the pap); or the officiating priests may eat it; or, if there be abundant pap, other Brâhmans also may eat of it. The pot having then been covered, before it is quite emptied, they put it away in a safe place, for the 'full-spoon ceremony.' Thereupon they let the calves together with their mothers; and thus the cattle take that nourishment.

In like manner as an invitatory prayer (is used at offerings) so does he by this (verse) invite him (Indra) to that share.

And in this way indeed he calls Indra in his own form to the slaying of Vritra ; for the bull is indeed Indra's form: hence he thereby calls Indra in his own form to the slaying of Vritra. If it roars, then one may know that Indra has come to his sacrifice, that his sacrifice is with Indra. And should it not roar, let the priest, seated on the south side (viz. the Brahman), say, 'Sacrifice!'--this, indeed, is Indra's voice.
dehi me dadāmi te ni me dhehi ni te dadhe nihāraṃ ca harāsi me nihāraṃ niharāṇi te svāheti //	He offers with the text , 'Give unto me, (and) I give unto thee. Bestow (gifts) on me, (and) I bestow on thee ! And mayest thou give me guerdon, (and) I will give thee guerdon! Svâhâ!'

For when Indra went forward in order to slay Vritra, the sportive Maruts were sporting around him singing his praises; and even so do they sport around this (Sacrificer), singing his praises, now that he is about to slay his wicked, spiteful enemy: thisis why (he sacrifices) to the sportive Maruts . Thereupon (follows the performance) of the Great Oblation (Mahâ-havis): this (performance) is in accordance with that of the great (seasonable) oblation .

There are ninefore-offerings and nine after-offerings , and three Samishtayagus. In the first place there are those five oblations .

Savitri, indeed, is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods; and impelled by Savitri they slew him: hence there is (a cake) for Savitri.
atha yatsārasvataścarurbhavati /	Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Sarasvatî.

Moreover, Agni is the priesthood, and Indra is the nobility; having allied these two, having closely united the priesthood with the nobility, they (the gods) slew him by means of these two powers: hence there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.
atha māhendraścarurbhavati /	Then follows a rice-part for Mahendra.

And thereby indeed he renders him great (strong), for the slaying of Vritra: for this reason also there is a rice-pap for Mahendra.
atha vaiśvakarmaṇa ekakapālaḥ puroḍāśo bhavati /	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Visvakarman.

Let him therefore perform this sacrifice.
mahāhaviṣā ha vai devā vṛtraṃ jaghnuḥ /	Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vritra, and gained that supreme authority which they now wield.

tadvasanto grīṣmo varṣāḥ / ete te ye vyajayanta śaraddhemantaḥ śiśirasta u te yānpunaḥ samairayanta //	Now the spring, the summer, and the rainy season,--they are those who vanquished (Vritra); and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season,--they are those whom they (the gods) recalled to life .

Moreover he thereby offers to those (fathers) the share which the gods assigned to them; and thus he gratifies those whom the gods recalled to life, and leads his own fathers up to a better world; and whatever injury or loss he suffers through his own unrighteous conduct (or wrong sacrificial performance) that is thereby made good to him: that is why he performs this sacrifice (to the fathers).
sa pitṛbhyaḥ somavadbhyaḥ / ṣaṭkapāla puroḍāśa nivapati somāya vā pitṛmate ṣaḍvā ṛtava ṛtavaḥ pitarastasmātṣaṭkapālo bhavati //	He offers a cake on six potsherds to the Pitarah Somavantah, or to Soma Pitrimat . Six doubtless are the seasons, and the fathers are the seasons: hence it is one of six potsherds.
atha pitṛbhyo barhiṣadbhyaḥ / anvāhāryapacane dhānāḥ kurvanti tato 'rdhāḥ piṃṣantyardhā ityeva dhānā apiṣṭā bhavanti tā dhānāḥ pitṛbhyo barhiṣadbhyaḥ //	Thereupon they parch barley-grain on the Anvâhâryapakana (or Dakshinâgni) for the Pitaro Barhishadah . They then grind one half of it; and (the other) half remains thus unground,--this is the parched grain for the Barhis-seated fathers.

It is indeed once for all that the fathers have departed, and hence is stirred but once.
tadye somenejānāḥ /	These are the oblations.

He takes out [the rice for] that cake of six potsherds, while seated behind the Gârhapatya, and looking southwards, with the sacrificial cord over his right shoulder. From thence he rises andthreshes (the rice), while standing north of the Dakshina-fire, with his face towards the south.

The reason why they keep the southern direction is because that is the region of the fathers: this is why they keep the southern direction.
atha dakṣiṇenānvāhāryapacanam /	Thereupon he raises a square altar south of the Dakshinâgni .

There are doubtless four intermediate quarters, and the fathers are the intermediate quarters: this is why he makes the corners point towards the intermediate quarters.

On all sides are the fathers, for the fathers are the intermediate regions, and the intermediate regions are indeed on all sides: this is why he lays down the fire in the centre.

Having enclosed it with the first line of enclosure, he (the Adhvaryu) draws (three) lines (across the altar) and [the Âgnîdhra] removes (from them the dust) which has to be removed. In the same way he encloses it with the second line of enclosure; and having enclosed it with the second line of enclosure, and smoothed it down, he says, 'Place the sprinkling water on (the altar)!' They accordingly place the sprinkling water on (the altar); and the firewood and barhis they lay down beside it .
tadāhuḥ /	He (the Âgnîdhra) wipes the spoons.

He (the Adhvaryu) takes butter, while 'sacrificially-invested .' Here now they say, 'Let him take butter in the upabhrit (by) twice (ladling with the dipping spoon); since there are two after-offerings at this (sacrifice).' Let him, nevertheless, ladle eight times into the upabhrit: let him do so, lest he should depart from the manner of the sacrifice.

Having thereupon sprinkled it andpoured out (the lustral water on the lower ends of the grass-stalks), and untied the knot, he (at once) seizes the knot, not the prastara ;--it is once for all that the fathers have departed: hence he does not take the prastara.

He then moves again thrice round (the altar) from left to right. The reason why he again moves thrice round from left to right, is that, while the first time he went away from here after those three ancestors of his, he now cones back again from them to this, his own world: that is why he again moves thrice round from left to right.
dakṣiṇā prastaraṃ stṛṇāti nāntardadhāti vidhṛtī sakṛdu hyeva parāñcaḥ pitarastasmānnāntardadhāti vidhṛtī //	He lays the enclosing-sticks along (the fire, with their tops) towards the south ; and the prastara also he spreads (with the grass-tops) towards the south; nor does he lay down the two vidhritis between (the barhis and the prastara).

Having then put down the dhruvâ, the cake, the parched grain, and the porridge (each east of the preceding one), he touches the oblations.

Only (this) one kindling-verse the Hotri recites , (and that) thrice;--the fathers have departed once for all: hence the Hotri recites thrice only one kindling-verse.

Thereupon he says, 'Bring Agni hither ! bring Soma hither! bring hither the fathers, accompanied by Soma! bring hither the fathers, seated on the barhis! bring hither the fathers, consumed by Agni! bring hither the butter-drinking gods! bring hither Agni for the Hotriship! bring hither (thine) own greatness !' Having thus called on (Agni) to bring hither (the fathers and gods), he sits down.

He performs four fore-offerings ,omitting the one to the Barhis; for the barhis means offspring, and he therefore performs the four fore-offerings without the one to the barhis, lest he should consign his offspring to the fathers. Thereupon they proceed with the two butter-portions; and having offered the two butter-portions,--

And furthermore, the (Adhvaryu's) call for the 'Sraushat' is 'Õm svadhâ!' and the (Âgnîdhra's) response is 'Astu svadhâ !' and the Vashat-call is 'Svadhâ namah!'

He does not walk over (to the south side of the fire); but having risen and stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he was seated), and called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the 'Sraushat,' he says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, accompanied by Soma!' and pours the oblation (into the fire) as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes a 'cutting' from (the north part of) the parched grain, and together therewith some of the porridge and the cake; puts down all this at the same time (in the guhû); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon, and re-anoints (the places of) the cuttings. He does not walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, seated on the barhis!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

He does not walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side, and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, consumed by the fire!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

The (places from which he has made the) cuttings he does not replenish with butter, nor does he walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he was seated), and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Kavyavâhana!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

And the reason why in making the cuttings, he keeps them together, is that the fathers are the seasons;--he thus keeps the seasons together, joins them to one another: that is why in making the cuttings, he keeps them together.

He then, with the text, 'N.N., wash thyself !' pours out water (in the north-west corner of the altar) for the Sacrificer's father to wash himself; and (in the southwest corner), with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the grandfather; and (in the south-east corner), with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the great-grandfather.[paragraph continues] As one would pour out water for (a guest) who is to take food with him, so in this case.

And in the corner opposite this intermediate quarter (the south-west), he presents one to the Sacrificer's grandfather, with 'N.N., this for thee!' And in the corner opposite this intermediate quarter (the southeast), he presents one to the Sacrificer's great-grandfather, with 'N.N., this for thee!' And in the corner opposite this intermediate quarter (the northeast), he cleanses (his hands), with the text , 'Here, O Fathers, regale yourselves! Like bulls come hither, each to his own share!' whereby he means to say, 'Eat ye each his share!' And the reason why he thus presents (food) to the Fathers is that in this way he does not exclude his own fathers from this sacrifice.

With 'N.N., wash thyself!' he pours out water (in the respective corner) for the Sacrificer's father to wash himself; with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the grandfather; with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the great-grandfather. As one would pour out water for (a guest) who has taken food with him, so in this case. And as to his again walking thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling,--they think, 'This holy work of ours shall be accomplished sunwise ,' and hence he walks thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling.

Six times he makes obeisance to them, since there are six seasons, and the Fathers are the seasons: hence he thereby establishes his sacrifice in the seasons,--that is why he makes obeisance six times . 'Give housesunto us; O Fathers!' he (further) says, because the Fathers are the guardians of houses;--and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacred performance.

He performs two after-offerings, omitting the one to the Barhis; for the Barhis means offspring: hence he performs two after-offerings, omitting the one to the Barhis, lest he should consign his offspring to the Fathers. He then separates the two spoons , after laying them down (in their respective places on the altar); and having separated them, and anointed the enclosing-sticks, he takes one enclosing-stick, calls for the 'Sraushat,' and says, 'The divine Hotris are summoned for the proclamation of success, the human is called upon for the song of praise!' The Hotri intones the 'song of praise (sûktavâka).' The Adhvaryu, on the other hand, does not seize the prastara-bunch, but watches while the Hotri recites the song of praise.

And thereby he delivers from Rudra's power both the descendants that are born unto him and those that are unborn; and his offspring is brought forth without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings.

(There being) one for each individual, he thereby delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that are born unto him; and there being an additional one, he thereby delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that are not yet born to him: this is why there are (as many cakes as there are descendants) exceeded by one.

From thence he rises and threshes (the rice), while standing with his face towards the north. He places the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to incline) towards the north; and puts the potsherds on the north side of the Gârhapatya hearth. As to why they keep the northern quarter,--that indeed is the quarter of that god (Rudra), and hence they keep the northern quarter.

He offers on a road,--for on roads that god roves; he offers on a cross-road,--for the cross-road, indeed, is known to be his (Rudra's) favourite haunt . This is why he offers on a cross-road.
palāśasya palāśena madhyamena juhoti /	He offers with the central leaflet of a palâsa-leaf.

Svâhâ!' Ambikâ , indeed, is the name of his (Rudra's) sister; and this share belongs to him conjointly with her; and because that share belongs to him conjointly with a woman (strî), therefore (these oblations) are called Tryambakâh.

Now as to that additional (cake),--he buries it in a mole-hill , with the text , 'This is thy share, O Rudra! the mole is thy animal (victim).' He thus assigns to him the mole as the only animal , and he (Rudra) does not therefore injure any other animal.
atha punaretya japanti /	Then as to why he buries (the cake): concealed, indeed, are embryos, and concealed also is what is buried,--that is why he buries it.

This is the prayer for blessing at this performance.

This is the prayer for blessing at this performance: thereby they invoke a blessing (upon the Sacrificer), for verily blessed is he who shall be severed from death, not from immortality. That is why he says, 'May I be severed from death, not from immortality.'

That sister of Rudra, named Ambikâ, indeed is the dispenser of happiness: hence the maidens also should walk round, thinking, 'May we enjoy prosperity!'

(world), not from thence (yonder world)!' By saying 'from this,' she means to say 'from my relatives;' and by saying 'not from thence,' she means to say 'not from husbands.' Husbands, doubtless, are the support of woman: hence she says 'not from thence.'

The Sacrificer now takes those (remains of the cakes) into his joined palms and throws them upwards higher than a cow can reach .

Now in this case his journey is beyond the Mûgavats: hence he says, 'Depart beyond the Mûgavats!'--'with thy bow unstrung and muffled up--,' whereby he means to say, 'Depart propitious, not injuring us ;' 'Clad in a skin,'--whereby he lulls him to sleep ; for while sleeping he injures no one: hence he says, 'Clad in a skin.'

Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him that offers the Seasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence there is no cessation for him.

The year means the whole, and the whole is imperishable (without end): hence his righteousness is indeed imperishable. Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness in the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him. This, then, is why he offers the Seasonal sacrifices.

Now that same prosperity whichaccrued to the gods on performing the Sâkamedha offerings, and that same essence which belonged to the year gained by them,--both these he takes possession of and makes his own: that is why he performs the Sunâsîrya.

There are five fore-offerings, three after-offerings, and one Samishtayagus.

And so does he, by means of them, obtain and make his own, both that prosperity which accrued to the gods from performing the Sâkamedha offerings, and that essence of the year which was gained by them. This is why those five oblations are (offered).
atha śunāsīryo dvādaśakapālaḥ puroḍāśo bhavati /	Then follows a Sunâsîrya cake on twelvepotsherds.

But it is by the rain that plants grow; and on the plants being eaten and the water drunk, milk is produced out of that water. Hence it is he (Vâyu) that produces it; and for this reason it is (offered) to Vâyu.

Now Sûrya, indeed, is yonder scorching (sun); it is he that governs all this (world), now by means of a good, now by a bad (king) ; he assigns its place to everything here, now under a good, now under a bad (king): 'Now that I have obtained the victory, may he, in his pleasure, govern me through a good (king), may he assign to me a place under a good (king)!' thus he thinks; and for this reason there is a cake on one potsherd for Sûrya.
tasyāśvaḥ śveto dakṣiṇā /	The priests' fee for this (oblation to Sûrya)is a white horse ; whereby it is made of the characteristic form of yonder scorching (sun).

For were the Phâlguna full-moon again to pass by without his havingoffered (Soma), he would certainly have to begin anew (to perform the Seasonal offerings): hence the Phâlguna full-moon should not again pass by without his offering Soma.

Now yonder sun, indeed, faces every quarter; it drinks up whatever (moisture) it dries up here: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes a consumer of food.
yato hyeva kutaścāgnāvabhyādadhati tata eva pradahati tenaiṣa sarvatomukhastenānnādaḥ //	This fire also faces every quarter, since it burns all they put into it from whatsoever quarter: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes a consumer of food.

It is by offeringthrice in the year that he comes to face all the quarters and becomes a consumer of food: let him therefore not trouble himself about shaving his head.'

Therewith he has (his head) shaved all round ; and thus he (the Adhvaryu) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.

And when he performs the Varunapraghâsa offerings, then he becomes Varuna, and attains to union with Varunaand to co-existence in his world.

Let them choose (the place) which lies highest, and above which no other part of the ground rises ; for it was from thence that the gods ascended to heaven, and he who is consecrated indeed ascends to the gods. He thus sacrifices on a place of worship frequented by the gods; but were any other part of the ground to rise above it, he would indeed be lowered while sacrificing: let them therefore choose (the place) which lies highest.

It should rise somewhat towards the south, that being the quarter of the Fathers. Were it to incline towards the south, the sacrifice would quickly go to yonder world; but in this way the sacrificer lives long: let it therefore rise somewhat towards the south.

It may be so in the south, and also in the north; but that place of worship alone is thoroughly efficient where the measure of the sacrificial ground is exceeded in the west; for to him (who possesses such a one) the higher worship of the gods readily inclines. So much as to the place of worship.

Hence in human (practice) a hall or shed is constructed with the top-beams running from south to north, because the north is the quarter of men. It is only for a consecrated, not for an unconsecrated person that it is (constructed) with the top-beams running from west to east.

He who is consecrated, truly draws nigh to the gods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods are secreted from men, and secret also is what is enclosed on every side: this is why they enclose it on every side. Not every one may enter it, but only a Brahman, or a Râganya, or a Vaisya, for these are able to sacrifice.

Now the gods do not commune with every one, but only with a Brahman, or a. Râganya, or a Vaisya; for these are able to sacrifice. Should there be occasion for him to converse with a Sûdra, let him say to one of those, 'Tell this one so and so! tell this one so and so!'This is the rule of conduct for the consecrated in such a case.

Thereby that (place of worship) of his becomes acceptable to all the gods, as well as to the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore; and that (place of worship) of his, which those Brâhmans versed in sacred lore see with their eyes, becomes acceptable to them. And when he says, 'Wherein all the gods delighted,' thereby it becomes acceptable for him to all the gods.

'May we rejoice in increase of substance and in sap!' Increase of substance doubtless means abundance, and abundance means prosperity: he. thereby invokes a blessing. 'May we rejoice in sap,' he says, because people say of one who enjoys prosperity and attains to the highest distinction, that 'he rejoices in sap;' therefore he says, 'May we rejoice in sap!'

For impure, indeed, is that part of man where water does not reach him. Now at the hair and beard, and at the nails the water does not reach him: hence when he shaves his hair and beard, and cuts his nails, he does so in order that he may be consecrated after becoming pure.
sarva eva vapante sarva eva medhyā bhūtvā dīkṣiṣyāmaha iti tadu tathā na kuryādyadvai keśaśmaśru ca vapate nakhāni ca nikṛntate tadeva medhyo bhavati tasmādu keśaśmaśru caiva vapeta nakhāni ca nikṛnteta //	Now some shave themselves all over, in order that they may be consecrated after becoming pure all over; but let him not do this. For even by shaving the hair of his head and his beard, and by cutting his nails, he becomes pure: let him therefore shave only the hair of his head and his beard, and cut his nails.

First (he cuts those) of the thumbs--for in human (practice) those of the little fingers (are cut) first, but with the gods in this manner.
sa dakṣiṇamevāgre godānaṃ vitārayati / savyaṃ vā agre mānuṣe 'thaivaṃ devatrā //	He first passes (the comb) through his right whisker--for in human (practice they comb) first the left whisker, but with the gods in this manner.

The reason why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto me,' is this: the waters are a thunderbolt, for the waters are indeed a thunderbolt; hence wherever these waters flow they produce a hollow, and whatever they come near that they destroy (lit. burn up). Hereby, then, he appeases that same thunderbolt; and thus appeased, that thunderbolt does not injure him. This is why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto me!'

For the razor is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the razor, does not injure him. Thereto he applies the razor, with the text, 'O knife, injure him not!' for the razor is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the razor, does not injure him.
pracidyodapātre prāsyati /	Having cut off (part of the stalk and hair), he throws it into the vessel of water.
tūṣṇīmevottaraṃ godānamabhyunatti tūṣṇīṃ darbhataruṇakamantardadhāti tūṣṇīṃ kṣureṇābhinidhāya pracidyodapātre prāsyati //	Silently he moistens the left whisker; silently he lays the stalk of grass on it; and having silently applied the razor thereto and cut through (it and the hair), he throws them into the vessel of water.
atha nāpitāya kṣuram prayacati / sa keśaśmaśru vapati sa yadā keśaśmaśru vapati //	He then hands the razor to the barber, and the latter shaves off the hair and beard. When he has shaved the hair and beard ,--
atha snāti /	He bathes.
amedhyo vai puruṣo yadanṛtaṃ vadati tena pūtirantarato medhyā vā āpo medhyo bhūtvā dīkṣā iti pavitraṃ vā āpaḥ pavitrapūto dīkṣā iti tasmādvai snāti //	For impure, indeed, is man: he is foul within, in that he speaks untruth;--and water is pure: he thinks, 'May I be consecrated, after becoming pure;'--and water is cleansing: he thinks, 'May I become consecrated after being cleansed!' This is the reason why he bathes.

'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with (heavenly) ghee!' For he, indeed, is thoroughly purified whom they have purified with ghee : accordingly he says, 'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with ghee!'--'For they, the divine, take away all taint;' now 'all' means 'every,' and 'taint' means what is impure; for they do take away from him every impurity: therefore he says, 'For they, the divine, take away all taint.'
atha prāṅivodaṅṅutkrāmati / udidābhyaḥ śucirā pūta emītyuddhyābhyaḥ śuciḥ pūta eti //	He steps out (from the water) towards the north-east , with the text, 'Cleansed and pure[paragraph continues] I go forth from them;' for cleansed and pure he indeed goes forth from them.
atha vāsaḥ paridhatte / sarvatvāyaiva svāmevāsminnetattvacaṃ dadhāti yā ha vā iyaṃ gostvakpuruṣe haiṣāgra āsa //	He then puts on a (linen) garment, for completeness’ sake: it is indeed his own skin he thereby puts on himself. Now that same skin which belongs to the cow was originally on man.

gavyetāṃ tvacamadadhustayaiṣā varṣantaṃ tayā himaṃ tayā ghṛṇiṃ titikṣate //	Accordingly, having flayed man, they put that skin on the cow, and therewith she now endures rain and cold and heat.

They then put that skin, the garment, on him; and for this reason none but man wears a garment, it having been put on him as his skin. Hence also one should take care to be properly clad, so that he may be completely endued with his own skin. Hence also people like to see even an ugly person properly clad, since he is endued with his own skin.
no hānte gornagnaḥ syāt /	Let him, then, not be naked in the presence of a cow.
veda ha gaurahamasya tvacam bibharmīti sā bibhyatī trasati tvacam ma ādāsyata iti tasmādu gāvaḥ suvāsasamupaiva niśrayante //	For the cow knows that she wears his skin, and runs away for fear lest he should take the skin from her. Hence also cows draw fondly near to one who is properly clad.

For thus indeed all the deities are concerned therein; and hence it is the garment of the consecrated.
tadvā ahataṃ syāt /	Let it (if possible) be a new one , for the sake of unimpaired vigour.

And if it be a new one, let him sprinkle it with water, so that it become clean. Or let him be consecrated in one which is laid aside to be worn (daily) after bathing, without being soaked (in some sharp cleansing substance) .

'I put thee on, the kindly and auspicious;' whereby he means to say, 'I put thee on, the kindly and pleasing one;'--[paragraph continues] 'fostering a fair appearance;' for evil indeed is that appearance which he has heretofore fostered while unconsecrated; but now (he fosters) a fair appearance: therefore he says, 'fostering a fair appearance.'
athainaṃ śālām prapādayati /	He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall.

The gods spake, 'Verily, the cow and the ox support everything here: come, let us bestow on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belongs to other species !' Accordingly they bestowed on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belonged to other species (of animals); and therefore the cow and the ox eat most. Hence, were one to eat (the flesh) of an ox or a cow, there would be, as it were, an eating of everything, or, as it were, a going on to the end (or, to destruction). Such a one indeed would be likely to be born (again) as a strange being, (as one of whom there is) evil report, such as 'he has expelled an embryo from a woman,' 'he has committed a sin ;' let him therefore not eat (the flesh) of the cow and the ox.
apaḥ praṇīya /	Nevertheless Yâgñavalkya said, 'I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender.'

Moreover Agni is the lower half, and Vishnu is the upper half of the sacrifice: 'I will become consecrated after encompassing all the deities, after encompassing the entire sacrifice,' thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishnu.
ādityebhyaścaruṃ nirvapanti tadasti paryuditamivāṣṭau putrāso aditerye jātāstanvaspari devāṃ upa praitsaptabhiḥ parā mārtāṇḍamāsyaditi //	Some then offer a rice-pap to the Âdityas. This is referred to , 'There are eight sons of Aditi who were born from her body; with seven she went to the gods, but Mârtânda she cast off.'
aṣṭau ha vai putrā aditeḥ /	Now Aditi had eight sons.

They accordingly fashioned it as this man is fashioned. The flesh which was cut off him, and thrown down in a lump, became the elephant: hence they say that one must not accept an elephant (as a gift) , since the elephant has sprung from man. Now he whom they thus fashioned was Vivasvat, the Âditya (or the sun); and of him (came) these creatures.

Accordingly he alone succeeds who offers that rice-pap to the Âdityas. Only that (cake) to Agni and Vishnu is, however, generally approved.
tasya saptadaśa sāmidhenyo bhavanti /	There are seventeen kindling-verses for it .

There are five fore-offerings and three after-offerings. For the sake of completeness they perform the patnîsamyâgas ; but he offers no samishtayagus, lest, having put on that garment of the consecrated, he should reach the end of the sacrifice before its completion; for the samishtayagus is the end of the sacrifice.
athāgreṇa śālāṃ tiṣṭhannabhyaṅkte /	He (the sacrificer) then gets himself anointed (with fresh butter), while standing east of the hall.
arurvai puruṣo 'vācito 'narurevaitadbhavati yadabhyaṅkte gavi vai puruṣasya tvaggorvā etannavanītam bhavati svayaivainametattvacā samardhayati tasmādvā abhyaṅkte //	For, having been flayed, man is sore; and by getting himself anointed, he becomes healed of his soreness: for man's skin is on the cow, and that fresh butteralso comes from the cow. He (the Adhvaryu) thus supplies him with his own skin, and for this reason he gets himself anointed.

Here, on the other hand, it is neither ghee nor creamy butter; it should rather be both ghee and creamy butter, for the sake of unimpaired vigour: by means of that which is of unimpaired vigour he accordingly makes him of unimpaired vigour.

The 'great ones,' doubtless, is one of the names of those cows, and their sap indeed it is: therefore he says, 'thou art the sap of the great ones.' 'Thou art life-giving: give me light!' There is nothing obscure in this.
athākṣyāvānakti /	Thereupon he anoints the eyes.
arurvai puruṣasyākṣi praśānmameti ha smāha yājñavalkyo durakṣa iva hāsa pūyo haivāsya dūṣīkā te evaitadanaruṣkaroti yadakṣyāvānakti //	'Sore, indeed, is the eye of man; mine is sound,' so spake Yâgñavalkya. Dim-eyed, indeed, he was (heretofore); and the secretion of his eyes was matter. He now makes his eyes sound by anointing them.
yatra vai devāḥ / asurarakṣasāni jaghnustacuṣṇo dānavaḥ pratyaṅ patitvā manuṣyāṇāmakṣīṇi praviveśa sa eṣa kanīnakaḥ kumāraka iva paribhāsate tasmā evaitadyajñamupaprayantsarvato 'śmapurām paridadhātyaśmā hyāñjanam //	Now, when the gods slew the Asura-Rakshas, Sushna , the Dânava, falling backward entered into the eyes of men: he is that pupil of the eye, andlooks like a young lad . Against him he (the sacrificer), now that he enters on the sacrifice, raises a rampart of stone all round himself, for the ointment is (produced from) stone.

The reason, then, why (ointment) from mount Trikakud (is used), is that he thereby puts eye into eye. Should he be unable to obtain any Traikakuda ointment, any other than Traikakuda may be used; for one and the same, indeed, is the significance of the ointment. He anoints (the eyes) with a reed-stalk, for the reed is a thunderbolt.
śareṣīkayānakti /	It is one with a tuft, in order to chase away the evil spirits .
vajro vai śaro virakṣastāyai satūlā bhavatyamūlaṃ vā idamubhayataḥ paricinnaṃ rakṣo 'ntarikṣamanucarati yathāyam puruṣo 'mūla ubhayataḥ paricinno 'ntarikṣamanucarati tadyatsatūlā bhavati virakṣastāyai //	For rootless,indeed, and unfettered on both sides, the Rakshas roams along the air; even as man here roams along the air , rootless and unfettered on both sides: the reason, then, why it is (a reed-stalk) with a tuft, is to chase away the evil spirits.
sa dakṣiṇamevāgra ānakti / savyaṃ vā agre mānuṣe 'thaivaṃ devatrā //	The right eye he anoints first; for in human practice the left (eye is anointed) first, but with the gods (it is done) thus.
vṛtrasyāsi kanīnaka iti vṛtrasya hyeṣa kanīnakaścakṣurdā asi cakṣurme dehīti nātra tirohitamivāsti //	He anoints it with the text, 'Thou art the eye-ball of Vritra,'--for Vritra's eye-ball it indeed is;--'Eye-giving thou art: give me the eye!' in this there is nothing obscure.
sakṛttūṣṇīmathottaraṃ sakṛdyajuṣānakti dvistūṣṇīṃ taduttaramevaitaduttarāvatkaroti //	The right eye he anoints once with the sacrificial formula, once silently; and the left one he anoints once with the formula, twice silently: thus he makes the left (or upper) one superior .
tadyatpañca kṛtva ānakti / saṃvatsarasammito vai yajñaḥ pañca vā ṛtavaḥ saṃvatsarasya tam pañcabhirāpnoti tasmātpañca kṛtva ānakti //	And the reason why he anoints five times, is that the sacrifice is of equal measure with the year, and five seasons there are in the year: he thus obtains possession of the latter in five (divisions), and therefore he anoints five times.

tadvā ekaṃ syāt / eko hyevāyam pavate tadetasyaiva rūpeṇa tasmādekaṃ syāt //	It may consist of one (stalk of grass); for that blower (or purifier, the Wind) is one only, and in accordance with his nature is this (cleanser): hence it may consist of one (stalk).

atho api sapta syuḥ / sapta vā ime śīrṣanprāṇāstasmātsapta syustriḥsaptānyeva syurekaviṃśatireṣaiva sampat //	Or there may be seven (stalks ); for there are seven vital airs of the head: hence there may be seven (stalks). There may even be thrice seven,--one and twenty: such indeed is perfection.

The lord of thought doubtless is Pragâpati : he thereby means to say, 'May Pragâpati purify me!' 'May the lord of speech purify me!' The lord of speech doubtless is Pragâpati : he thereby means to say, 'May Pragâpati purify me!' 'May the divine Savitri purify me,'--for well purified indeed is he whom the divine[paragraph continues] Savitri has purified ; therefore he says, 'May the divine Savitri purify me!'--'with a flawless cleanser;' for that blower (the wind) is indeed a flawless cleanser: 'with that one,' he means to say; 'with the rays of the sun;' for they, the rays of the sun, are indeed purifiers; therefore he says, 'with the rays of the sun.'
pavitrapatirhi bhavati pavitrapūtasyeti pavitrapūto hi bhavati yatkāmaḥ pune tacakeyamiti yajñasyodṛcaṃ gacānītyevaitadāha //	'O Lord of the pavitra' (means of purification),--for he (who is consecrated) is indeed the lord of the pavitra,--'of thee, purified by the pavitra,--for he is indeed purified by the pavitra;--'with whatsoever desire I purify myself, may I be able to effect it!' whereby he says, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'
ā vo devāsa īmahe vāmam prayatyadhvare ā vo devāsa āśiṣo yajñiyāso havāmaha iti tadasmai svāḥ satīrṛtvija āśiṣa āśāsate //	He then makes him pronounce the beginning of the benedictions , 'We approach you, O gods, for desirable goods, at the opening of the sacrifice; we call on you, O gods, for holy blessings.' Thereby the officiating priests invoke on him those blessings which are their own.
athāṅgulīrnyacati /	He (the sacrificer) then bends his fingers inwards, viz.

Not visiblyindeed is the sacrifice to be taken hold of, as is either this staff or the garment,--but invisible indeed are the gods, invisible is the sacrifice.
svāhā yajñam manasa iti tanmanasa ārabhate svāhororantarikṣāditi tadantarikṣādārabhate svāhā dyāvāpṛthivībhyāmiti tadābhyāṃ dyāvāpṛthivībhyāmārabhate yayoridaṃ sarvamadhi svāhā vātādārabha iti vāto vai yajñastadyajñam pratyakṣamārabhate //	Now when he says, 'Hail, from the mind (I take hold of) the sacrifice,' he takes hold of it from the mind;--in saying, 'From the wide ether,' he takes hold of it from the ether;--in saying, 'From heaven and earth,' he takes hold of it from those two, heaven and earth, on which this entire universe rests;--and in saying, 'From the wind I take hold of (the sacrifice)'--the wind being the sacrifice--he takes hold of the sacrifice directly.
yajño vai svāhākāro yajñamevaitadātmandhatte 'tro eva vācaṃ yacati vāgvai yajño yajñamevaitadātmandhatte //	And when he calls, 'Hail! Hail !'--the 'Svâhâ' being the sacrifice--he thereby appropriates the sacrifice. Here now he restrains his speech; the sacrifice being speech: he thereby appropriates the sacrifice.
athainaṃ śālām prapādayati /	He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall.

The reason why this is his passage until the Soma pressing is this. The fire is the womb of the sacrifice, and the consecrated is an embryo; and the embryo moves aboutwithin the womb. And since he (the sacrificer) moves about there (between the fires), and now turns round and now back, therefore these embryos move about, and now turn round and now back. Hence this is his passage till the Soma pressing.

He elevates himself by means of these same formulas, and therefore they say that all formulas of the consecration are 'audgrabhana.' Now they also (specially) designate these intermediate ones as 'audgrabhana,' because these are libations , and a libation is a sacrifice. For the muttering of a sacrificial formula is an occult (form of sacrifice), but a libation is a direct (form of) sacrifice: hence it is by this same sacrifice that he elevates himself from this world to the world of the gods.

The fourth libation is made for the sake of completeness; while the fifth, which is made with the offering-spoon (sruk, viz. the guhû), is the real audgrabhana-libation: for he makes it with ananushtubh verse, and the anushtubh is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech.
yajñena vai devāḥ /	By means of the sacrifice the gods obtained that supreme authority which they now wield.

They then sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and effaced its traces by means of the sacrificial stake, they disappeared: and because they effaced (scattered, yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (stake).
tadvā ṛṣīṇāmanuśrutamāsa /	Now this was heard by the Rishis.
te yajñaṃ samabharanyathāyaṃ yajñaḥ sambhṛta evaṃ vā eṣa yajñaṃ sambharati yadetāni juhoti //	They collected the sacrifice, just as this sacrifice is collected (prepared) ; for even so does he now collect the sacrifice, when he offers those (audgrabhana) libations.
tāni vai pañca juhoti / saṃvatsarasammito vai yajñaḥ pañca vā ṛtavaḥ saṃvatsarasya tam pañcabhirāpnoti tasmātpañca juhoti //	He offers five libations, because the sacrifice is commensurate to the year, and there are five seasons in the year: thus he gains it (the year) in five (divisions), and therefore he makes five libations.
athāto homasyaiva / ākutyai prayuje 'gnaye svāhetyā vā agre kuvate yajeyeti tadyadevātra yajñasya tadevaitatsambhṛtyātmankurute //	Now then of the oblation : 'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!' At the outset he indeed purposes to sacrifice. What part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this (first libation), that he now collects and makes his own.
medhayā vai manasābhigacati yajeyeti tadyadevātra yajñasya tadevaitatsambhṛtyātmankurute // dīkṣāyai tapase 'gnaye svāheti /	'To Wisdom, to Thought, to Agni, hail!' with wisdom and thought he indeed conceives that he may sacrifice. What part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this (second libation), that he now collects and makes his own.
anvevaitaducyate nettu hūyate //	'To Initiation, to Penance, to Agni, hail!' This is merely uttered, but no libation is made.
sarasvatyai pūṣṇe 'gnaye svāheti / vāgvai sarasvatī vāgyajñaḥ paśavo vai pūṣā puṣṭirvai pūṣā puṣṭiḥ paśavaḥ paśavo hi yajñastadyadevātra yajñasya tadevaitatsambhṛtyātmankurute //	'To Sarasvatî, to Pûshan, to Agni, hail!' Now Sarasvatî is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech. And Pûshan represents cattle, because Pûshan means prosperity (pushti), and cattle also means prosperity, since the sacrifice means cattle. What part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this (third libation), that he now collects and makes his own.
tadāhuḥ / anaddhevaitā āhutayo hūyante 'pratiṣṭhitā adevakāstatra nendro na somo nāgniriti //	As to this they say, 'These (three) libations are offered indefinitely; they are unestablished, without a god: therein is neither Indra, nor Soma, nor Agni.'
ākūtyai prayuje 'gnaye svāheti / nāta ekaṃ canāgnirvā addhevāgniḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ sa yadagnau juhoti tenaivaitā addheva tena pratiṣṭhitāstasmādu sarvāsvevāgnaye svāheti juhoti tata etānyādhītayajūṃṣītyācakṣate //	'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!'--not any one (god we obtain) from this ! But Agni surely is definite, Agni is established: when he offers in Agni (the fire), surely those (libations) are thereby made definite, are thereby established: for this reason he offers at all libations with, 'To Agni, hail!' Moreover, these libations are called 'âdhîtayagûmshi.'
ākūtyai prayuje 'gnaye svāheti / ātmanā vā agra ākuvate yajeyeti tamātmana eva prayuṅkte yattanute te asyaite ātmandevate ādhīte bhavata ākūtiśca prayukca //	'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!' he says; for by his own mind he purposes to sacrifice, and from his own mind he impels it (the sacrifice) when he performs it: these two deities the Purpose and the Impulse--are meditated upon (âdhîta) in his mind.
medhāyai manase 'gnaye svāheti / medhayā vai manasābhigacati yajeyeti te asyaite ātmandevate ādhīte bhavato medhā ca manaśca //	'To Wisdom, to Thought, to Agni, hail!' he says; for with wisdom and thought he indeed conceives that he may sacrifice: these two deities--[paragraph continues] Wisdom and Thought--are meditated upon in his mind.

Pûshan, on the other hand, means cattle, for Pûshan means prosperity (pushti), and cattle means prosperity, since the sacrifice means cattle: hence cattle-are meditated upon in his mind. And because these deities are meditated upon (â-dhîta) in his mind, therefore (these libations) are called âdhîtayagûmshi.

Heaven and Earth, wide Ether! let us render homage unto Brihaspati with offering, hail!' This (libation) truly is nearer to the sacrifice, since he praises the waters, and water is sacrifice. 'Heaven and Earth! wide Ether!' he says, because he thereby praises the worlds. 'Let us render homage unto Brihaspati, with offering, hail!' he says; for Brihaspati is the Brahman, and the sacrifice also is the Brahman: for this reason also this (libation) is nearer to the sacrifice.
atha yām pañcamīṃ srucā juhoti / sā haiva pratyakṣaṃ yajño 'nuṣṭubhā hi tāṃ juhoti vāgghyanuṣṭubvāgghi yajñaḥ //	But the fifth libation which he makes with the offering-spoon (sruk), doubtless is the veritable sacrifice; for he offers it with an anushtubh (verse), and the anushtubh is speech and so is the sacrifice.
tajjuhvāmānayati triḥ sruveṇājyavilāpanyā adhi juhvāṃ gṛhṇāti yattṛtīyaṃ gṛhṇāti tatsruvamabhipūrayati // sa juhoti /	In the first place he pours the butter, which remains in the dhruvâ, into the guhû. He then ladles with the sruva three times butter from the melting-pot into the guhû: with what he takes the third time he fills the sruva .
viśvo devasya neturmarto vurīta sakhyam viśvo rāya iṣudhyati dyumnaṃ vṛṇīta puṣyase svāheti // saiṣā devatābhiḥ paṅktirbhavati / viśvo devasyeti vaiśvadevaṃ neturiti sāvitram marto vurīteti maitraṃ dyumnaṃ vṛṇīteti bārhaspatyaṃ dyumnaṃ hi bṛhaspatiḥ puṣyasa iti pauṣṇam //	He offers, with the text , 'May every mortal espouse the friendship of the divine guide! every one prayeth for wealth: let him choose glory, that he may prosper, hail!' Now this (verse and libation) consists of five parts in respect of deities : 'visvo devasya' refers to the Visve Devâh; 'netur' to Savitri; 'marto vurîta' to Mitra; 'dyumnam vrinîta' to Brihaspati, since Brihaspati means dyumna (glory); and 'pushyase' (for prospering) refers to Pûshan.
saiṣā devatābhiḥ paṅktirbhavati / pāṅkto yajñaḥ pāṅktaḥ paśuḥ pañcartavaḥ saṃvatsarasyaitamevaitayāpnoti yaddevatābhiḥ paṅktirbhavati //	This (libation), then, consists of five parts, in respect of deities;--fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, and five seasons there are in the year: the latter he accordingly gains by this (libation) consisting of five parts in respect of deities.
tāṃ vā anuṣṭubhā juhoti / vāgvā anuṣṭubvāgyajñastadyajñam pratyakṣamāpnoti //	He offers this libation with an anushtubh verse, because the anushtubh is speech, and the sacrifice is speech; so that he thereby obtains the real sacrifice.

And, indeed , ifhe offers only this one, he would offer a full-offering; and the full means everything: hence he gains everything by this (oblation). And by filling the dipping-spoon (sruva), he fills the offering-spoon (guhû), and the latter he offers full. This, however, is a mere statement (of others’ views) , but all (five) libations are offered.
tāṃ vā anuṣṭubhā juhoti /	He offers this one with an anushtubh verse.
saiṣānuṣṭupsatyekatriṃśadakṣarā bhavati daśa pāṇyā aṅgulayo daśa pādyā daśa prāṇā ātmaikatriṃśo yasminnete prāṇāḥ pratiṣṭhitā etāvānvai puruṣaḥ puruṣo yajñaḥ puruṣasammito yajñaḥ sa yāvāneva yajño yāvatyasya mātrā tāvantamevainayaitadāpnoti yadanuṣṭubhaikatriṃśadakṣarayā juhoti //	Being an anushtubh verse, it consists of thirty-one syllables. Now there are ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, and the thirty-first is the body wherein those vital airs are contained; for this much constitutes man, and the sacrifice is a man, the sacrifice is of the same proportion as a man . Thus, whatever the extent of the sacrifice, whatever its measure, to that extent he takes possession of it by means of this (libation), when he offers it with an anushtubh verse of thirty-one syllables.
dakṣiṇenāhavanīyam prācīnagrīve kṛṣṇājine upastṛṇāti /	South of the Âhavanîya he spreads two black antelope skins on the ground, with the neck parts towards the east: thereon he consecrates him.
tayorenamadhi dīkṣayati yadi dve bhavatastadanayorlokayo rūpaṃ tadenamanayorlokayoradhi dīkṣayati //	If there are two (skins), they are an image of these two worlds (heaven and earth), and thus he consecrates him on these two worlds.
sambaddhāntāviva hīmau lokau tardmasamute paścādbhavatastadimāveva lokau mithunīkṛtya tayorenamadhi dīkṣayati //	They are joined (fitted) together along their edge , for these two worlds are also, as it were, joined together at their edge. At the hind part they are fastened together through holes: thus, after uniting (mithunîkritya) these two worlds, he consecrates him thereon.
yadyu eka bhavati / tadeṣāṃ lokānāṃ rūpaṃ tadenameṣu lokeṣvadhi dīkṣayati yāni śuklāni tāni divo rūpaṃ yāni kṛṣṇāni tānyasyai yadi vetarathā yānyeva kṛṣṇāni tāni divo rūpaṃyāni śuklāni tānyasyai yānyeva babhrūṇīva harīṇi tānyantarikṣasya rūpaṃ tadenameṣu lokeṣvadhi dīkṣayati //	But if there be only one (skin), then it is an image of these (three) worlds; then he consecrates him on these (three) worlds. Those (hairs) which are white are an image of the sky; those which are black are (an image) of this (earth);--or, if he likes, conversely: those which are black are an image of the sky, and those which are white are (an image) of this (earth). Those which are of a brownish yellow colour , are an image of the atmosphere. Thus he consecrates him on these (three) worlds.
antakamu tarhi paścātpratyasyet / tadimāneva lokānmithunīkṛtya teṣvenamadhi dīkṣayati //	And let him, in that case, turn in the hind end (of the skin) : thus, after uniting these worlds with each other, he consecrates him thereon.

garbho vā eṣa bhavati yo dīkṣate sa candāṃsi praviśati tasmānnvaknāṅguliriva bhavati nyaknāṅgulaya iva hi garbhāḥ //	'I touch you.' Now, he who is consecrated becomes an embryo, and enters into the metres: hence he has his hands closed, since embryos have their hands closed.
te vāmārabha iti te vām praviśāmītyevaitadāha te mā pātamāsya yajñasyodṛca iti te mā gopāyatamāsya yajñasya saṃsthāyā ityevaitadāha //	And when he says, 'I touch you,' he means to say, 'I enter into you.' 'Do ye guard me up to the goal of this sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'Do ye protect me until the completion of this sacrifice!'
atha dakṣiṇena jānunārohati / śarmāsi śarma me yaceti carma vā etatkṛṣṇasya tadasya tanmānuṣaṃ śarma devatrā tasmādāha śarmāsi śarma me yaceti namaste astu mā mā hiṃsīriti śreyāṃsaṃ vā eṣa upādhirohati yo yajñaṃ yajño hi kṛṣṇājinaṃ tasmā evaitadyajñāya nihnute tatho hainameṣa yajño na hinasti tasmādāha namaste astu mā mā hiṃsīriti //	He then kneels down with his right knee (on the skin), with the text, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge!' for the skin (karma) of the black deer it is indeed among men, but among the gods it is a refuge (sarma): therefore he says, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge.' 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!' Now he who raises himself upon the sacrifice doubtless raises himself to one that is his better; for the black deer skin is a (means of) sacrifice. Hereby, now, he propitiates that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure him: for this reason he says, 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!'
sa vai jaghanārdha ivaivāgra āsīta /	He must indeed sit down first on the hind part (of the skin).
atha yadagra eva madhya upaviśedya enaṃ tatrānuṣṭhyā hareddrapsyati vā pra vā patiṣyatīti tathā haiva syāttasmājjaghanārdha ivaivāgra āsīta //	Were he, on the other hand, to sit down at once in the middle (of the skin), and wereany one there to curse him, saying, 'He shall either become demented or fall down headlong!' then that would indeed come to pass.
atha mekhalām pariharate /	He then girds himself with the zone.

They then perceived this (source of) strength (viz. the zone), and this (source of) strength they put in (or round) the middle of their body as a (means of attaining) completion: and thereby they attained completion. And so does he now put that (source of) strength in the middle of his body and thereby attain completion.
sā vai śāṇī bhavati /	Hempen it is in order to be soft.

And that which was the outer membrane (and placenta) became the garment of the consecrated. Now the amnion lies under the outer membrane, and hence that (zone) is worn under the garment. And in like manner as Pragâpati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, so does he become an embryo and spring forth from that sacrifice.
sā vai trivṛdbhavati / trivṛddhyannam paśavo hyannam pitā mātā yajjāyate tattṛtīyaṃ tasmāttrivṛdbhavati //	It (the cord) is a triple one, because food is threefold, food being cattle. (Moreover) the father and mother (are two), and that which is born is a third: hence it is a triple (cord).
muñjavalśenānvastā bhavati /	It is plaited afterthe manner of a braid of hair.

tām pariharate / ūrgasyāṅgirasītyaṅgiraso hyetāmūrjamapaśyannūrṇamradā ūrjam mayi dhehīti nātra tirohitamivāsti //	He girds himself with it, with the text , 'Thou art the strength of the Aṅgiras,'--for the Aṅgiras perceived this (source of) strength; 'soft as wool, bestow thou strength on me!' there is nothing obscure in this.
atha nīvimudgūhate / somasya nīvirasītyadīkṣitasya vā asyaiṣāgre nīvirbhavatyathātra dīkṣitasya somasya tasmādāha somasya nīvirasīti //	He then tucks up the end of his (nether) garment, with the text, 'Thou art Soma's tuck.' For heretofore it was the tuck of him, the unconsecrated; but now that he is consecrated, it is that of Soma : therefore he says, 'Thou art Soma's tuck.'
atha prorṇute /	He then wraps up (his head) .
garbho vā eṣa bhavati yo dīkṣate prāvṛtā vai garbho ulbeneva jarāyuṇeva tasmādvai prorṇute //	For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and embryos are enveloped both by the amnion and the outer membrane: therefore he covers (his head).

He who is consecrated indeed becomes both Vishnu and a sacrificer; for when he is consecrated, he is Vishnu; and when he sacrifices, he is the sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Thou art Vishnu's refuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.'
atha kṛṣṇaviṣāṇāṃ sici badhnīte /	Thereupon he ties a black deer's horn to theend (of his garment ).
devāśca vā asurāścobhaye prājāpatyāḥ prajāpateḥ piturdāyamupeyurmana eva devā upāyanvācamasurā yajñameva taddevā upāyanvācamasurā amūmeva devā upāyannimāmasurāḥ // te devā yajñamabruvan /	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, entered upon their father Pragâpati's inheritance: the gods came in for the Mind and the Asuras for Speech. Thereby the gods came in for the sacrifice and Asuras for speech; the gods for yonder (heaven) and the Asuras for this (earth).
yoṣā vā iyaṃ vāgupamantrayasva hvayiṣyate vai tveti svayaṃ vā haivaikṣata yoṣā vā iyaṃ vāgupamantrayai hvayiṣyate vai meti tāmupāmantrayata sā hāsmā ārakādivaivāgra āsūyattasmādu strī puṃsopamantritārakādivaivāgre 'sūyati sa hovācārakādiva vai ma āsūyīditi //	The gods said to Yagña (m., the sacrifice), 'That Vâk (f., speech) is a woman: beckon her, and she will certainly call thee to her.' Or it may be, he himself thought, 'That Vâk is a woman: I will beckon her and she will certainly call me to her.' He accordingly beckoned her. She, however, at first disdained him from the distance: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, at first disdains him from the distance.
upaiva bhagavo mantrayasva hvayiṣyate vai tveti tāmupāmantrayata sā hāsmai nipalāśamivovāda tasmādu strī puṃsopamantritā nipalāśamivaiva vadati sa hovāca nipalāśamiva vai me 'vādīditi //	He said, 'She has disdained me from the distance.' They said, 'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.' He beckoned her; but she only replied to him, as it were, by shaking her head: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, only replies to him, as it were, by shaking her head.
upaiva bhagavo mantrayasva hvayiṣyate vai tveti tāmupāmantrayata sā hainaṃ juhuva tasmādu strī pumāṃsaṃ hvayata evottamaṃ sa hovācāhvata vai meti //	He said, 'She has only replied to me by shaking her head.' They said, 'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.' He beckoned her, and she called him to her; and hence a woman at last calls the man to her.
te devā īkṣāṃ cakrire /	He said, 'She has indeed called me.'

She then went up to where he was standing. Hence a woman goes to a man who stays in a well-trimmed (house)."

The gods then cut her off from the Asuras; and having gained possession of her and enveloped her completely in fire, they offered her up as a holocaust, it being an offering of the gods . And in that they offered her with an anushtubh verse, thereby they made her their own; and the Asuras, being deprived of speech, were undone, crying, 'He ’lavah! he ’lavah !
tatraitāmapi vācamūduḥ / upajijñāsyāṃ sa mlecastasmānna brāhmaṇo mlecedasuryā haiṣā vā natevaiṣa dviṣatāṃ sapatnānāmādatte vācaṃ te 'syāttavacasaḥ parābhavanti ya evametadveda //	Such was the unintelligible speech which they then uttered,--and he (who speaks thus) is a Mlekkha (barbarian). Hence let no Brahman speak barbarous language, since such is the speech of the Asuras. Thus alone he deprives his spiteful enemies of speech; and whosoever knows this, his enemies, being deprived of speech, are undone.
so 'yaṃ yajño vācamabhidadhyau / mithunyenayā syāmiti tāṃ saṃbabhūva //	That Yagña (sacrifice) lusted after Vâk (speech ), thinking, 'May I pair with her!' He united with her.
mahadvā ito 'bhvaṃ janiṣyate yajñasya ca mithunādvācaśca yanmā tannābhibhavediti sa indra eva garbho bhūtvaitanmithunam praviveśa //	Indra then thought within himself, 'Surely a great monster will spring from this union of Yagña and Vâk: [I must take care] lest it should get the better of me.' Indra himself then became an embryo and entered into that union.

And because it was by pressing it tightly together that Indra tore out (the womb), therefore it (the horn) is bound tightly (to the end of the garment); and as Indra,having become an embryo, sprang from that union, so is he (the sacrificer), after becoming an embryo, born from that union (of the skin and the horn).
tāṃ vā uttānāmiva badhnāti /	He ties it (to the end of the garment) with the open part upwards, for it is in this way that the womb bears the embryo.

Thereby he produces the sacrifice; for when there is a good year, then there is abundant (material) for sacrifice; but when there is a bad year, then there is not even enough for himself: hence he thereby produces the sacrifice.

Thereafter the consecrated would be liable to be affected with the itch; and--offspring (retas) coming after the consecrated--that offspring would then also be liable to be born with the itch. Now hisown womb does not injure its offspring, and that black deer's horn being indeed his own womb, that (horn) does not injure him; and therefore the consecrated should scratch himself with the black deer's horn and with nothing but the black deer's horn.
athāsmai daṇḍam prayacati / vajro vai daṇḍo virakṣastāyai //	He (the Adhvaryu) then hands to him a staff, for driving away the evil spirits,--the staff being a thunderbolt.

But let him not do so; for in like manner as if one were to try to overtake some one who runs away, but could not overtake him, so does he not overtake the sacrifice. Let him therefore turn in his fingers and restrain his speech on that (former) occasion.
ṛcaṃ vā yajurvā sāma vābhivyāharatyabhisthiramabhisthiramevaitadyajñamārabhate tasmādamutraivāṅgulīrnyacedamutra vācaṃ yacet //	And when the consecrated (after restraining his speech) utters either a rik, or a sâman, or a yagus ,he thereby takes a firmer and firmer hold of the sacrifice: let him therefore turn in his fingers and restrain his speech on that (former) occasion.

In that case, then, let him mutter either a rik or a yagus addressed to Vishnu, for Vishnu is the sacrifice: thereby he again gets hold of the sacrifice; and this is the atonement for that (transgression).

Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.

But he, forsooth, is truly born, who is born of the Brahman (neut.), of the sacrifice: wherefore let him address even a Râganya, or a Vaisya, as Brâhman, since he who is born of the sacrifice is born of the Brahman (and hence a Brâhmana). Wherefore they say, 'Let no one slay a sacrificer of Soma; for by (slaying) a Soma-sacrificer he becomes guilty of a heinous sin !
vācaṃ yacati / sa vācaṃyama āsta āstamayāttadyadvācaṃ yacati //	He maintains silence; and silently he remains seated till sunset. The reason why he maintains silence is this:
yajñena vai devāḥ /	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield.

They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared: and because they scattered (yopaya, viz. the sacrifice) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post) .
tadvā ṛṣīṇāmanuśrutamāsa /	Now this was heard by the Rishis.

He has been consecrated during the day, and he has gained the night: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its extent, to that extent has he gained it before he breaks silence.

But let him not do so, for what would become of them if it were cloudy? Let him therefore break silence as soon as he thinks the sun has set.

But let him not do so; for he who breaks silence with that (formula) does not strengthen the sacrifice, does not heal the sacrifice.

[prepare ye the fast-food!] Agni is the Brahman, Agni is the sacrifice; the tree is meet for the sacrifice.' For this indeed is his sacrifice, this is his havis-offering at this (rite of consecration), even as the Agnihotra was heretofore . In thus preparing the (Soma) sacrifice by means of the sacrifice, he establishes the sacrificein the sacrifice, and carries on the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice; for (the partaking of) that fast-food is indeed carried on by him till the pressing of the Soma. Thrice he pronounces (the first words ), for threefold is the sacrifice.

In pronouncing the first (part of the formula) he utters the truth of speech .

But the sacrificial food of the gods must be cooked, and not uncooked: hence they cook it, and he partakes of that fast-milk[paragraph continues] (vrata) and does not offer it in the fire.
yajñena vai devāḥ /	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield.

They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post).

As that sacrifice was collected, so does he who is consecrated now become the sacrifice, for it is he that carries it on, that produces it. And whatever (sap) of the sacrifice was sucked out and drained, that he now restores again by sipping the fast-milk and not offering it in the fire; for, assuredly, were he to offer it in the fire, he would not replenish (the sacrifice). But let him, nevertheless, think (that he does so) sacrificing and not the reverse.

But let him not do this; for he who adds both rice and barley (to the milk) neither replenishes the sacrifice nor heals it. Let him therefore add only the one or the other (cereal). Both the rice and barley doubtless form his (havis) material for offering (at the New and Full-moon Sacrifice), and when they do so become his material for offering, then they are also 'taken hold of ' by him. Should the vrata, cow yield no milk, let him prepare the fast-food of whichever of them he pleases."

But let him notdo this, lest he should do what is inauspicious to the sacrifice; for those people do at the sacrifice what is a human act, and inauspicious to the sacrifice assuredly is that which is human. If any disease were to befall him who is consecrated, let him cure it wherewith he pleases; for completion is proper .
athāsmai vratam prayacati /	He (the Adhvaryu) hands the fast-food to him, after letting the ordinary (meal-)time pass,--viz.

Heretofore, indeed, it was for a human meal that he cleansed himself, but now it is for the sake of divine devotion: therefore he says, 'For the sake of assistance we turn our thoughts to divine devotion, the source of supreme mercy, the bestower of glory, the bearer of sacrifices: may itprosper our ways, according to our desire!' Whenever, being about to take the fast-food, he touches water, let him touch it with this same (formula).

Hail to them!' Thus that (fast-food) comes to be for him (by means of the Svâhâ) as an oblation consecrated by the Vashat.

Now, he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities; but the sacrificial food of the gods is not increased (with other material): hence, if in handing the fast-food (to the consecrated) he increases it (with other milk), he commits a fault and breaks the fast. This (formula), however, is the atonement for that (transgression), and thus that fault is not committed by him, and he does not break the fast (or vow): therefore he says, 'Ye waters .

For this earth truly is divine, and serves as a place for the worship of the gods: it must not be defiled by him who is consecrated. Having lifted up this its sacrificially pure covering , he now relieves himself on its impure body, with the formula, 'I discharge not offspring, but waters,'--for so indeed he does ; 'delivering from trouble, and consecrated by Svâhâ,'--for they do indeed deliver from trouble what is pressed together inside: therefore he says, 'delivering from trouble,'--'consecrated by Svâhâ, enter ye the earth!' whereby he means to say, 'Having become offerings, do ye enter the earth, appeased!'

Now, Agni is the Lord of vows among the gods,--it is to him therefore that he resorts : 'Thou, O Agni, art the divine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at the sacrifices.' This, then, is his atonement for that (transgression); and thus that fault is not committed by him, and he does not break his vow: therefore he says, 'Thou, O Agni, art the divine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at the sacrifices.'

Before sunrise he says, 'Consecrated, restrain thy speech!' and after sunrise he releaseshis speech,--for the sake of continuity: with the night he continues the day, and with the day the night.

Prior to the purificatory bath he should not enter water, nor should it rain upon him; for it is improper that he should enter water, or that it should rain upon him, before the purificatory bath. Moreover, he speaks his speech falteringly, and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech . The reason why he speaks his speech falteringly and not after the manner of ordinary speech is this:
yajñena vai devāḥ /	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield.
imāṃ jitiṃ jigyuryaiṣāmiyaṃ jitiste hocuḥ kathaṃ na idam manuṣyairanabhyārohyaṃ syāditi te yajñasya rasaṃ dhītvā yathā madhu madhukṛto nirdhayeyurviduhya yajñaṃ yūpena yopayitvā tiro 'bhavannatha yadenenāyopayaṃstasmādyūpo //	They spake, 'How can this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post).
tadvā ṛṣīṇāmanuśrutamāsa /	Now this was heard by the Rishis.

And whatever part of the sacrificewas then sucked out and drained, that he now restores again by speaking his speech falteringly and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech. For were he to speak effusively after the manner of ordinary speech, he would not restore (the sap of the sacrifice): therefore he speaks his speech falteringly and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech.
vāce hi dhīkṣate yajñāya hi dhīkṣate yajño hi vāgdhīkṣito ha vai nāmaitadyaddīkṣita iti //	He verily anoints himself,--it is for speech that he anoints himself , since he anoints himself for the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is speech.
ādityaṃ carum prāyaṇīyaṃ nirvapati /	He prepares the Prâyanîya rice-pap for Aditi.

She thought, 'How is it that, in spreading the sacrifice on me, they should exclude me from the sacrifice?' and confounded their sacrifice: they knew not that sacrifice.
yannvasyāmeva yajñamataṃsmahi kathaṃ nu no 'mahatkathaṃ na prajānīma iti //	They said, 'How comes it that our sacrifice was confounded, when we spread it on this (earth)? how is it that we know it not?'
asyāmeva yajñaṃ tanvānā imāṃ yajñādantaragāma sā na iyameva yajñamamūmuhadimāmevopadhāvāmeti //	They said, 'In spreading the sacrifice on her, we have excluded her from the sacrifice: it is she that has confounded our sacrifice,--let us have recourse to her!'
yannu tvayyeva yajñamataṃsmahi kathaṃ nu no 'muhatkathaṃ na prajānīma iti //	They said, 'When we were spreading the sacrifice on thee, how was it that it became confounded, that we know it not?'

Set ye aside a share for me; then ye shall see the sacrifice, then ye shall know it!'
tatheti devā abruvan / tavaiva prāyaṇīyastavodayanīya iti tasmādeṣa āditya eva prāyaṇīyo bhavatyāditya udayanīya iyaṃ hyevāditistato yajñamapaśyaṃstamatanvata //	'So be it!' said the gods: 'Thine, forsooth, shall be the opening (prâyanîya ), and thine the concluding (udayanîya) oblation!' This is why both the Prâyanîya and the Udayanîya (pap) belongto Aditi; for Aditi truly is this (earth).
sa yadādityaṃ carum prāyaṇīyaṃ nirvapati / yajñasyaiva dṛṣṭyai yajñaṃ dṛṣṭvā krīṇāni taṃ tanavā iti tasmādādityaṃ carum prāyaṇīyaṃ nirvapati tadvai niruptaṃ havirāsīdaniṣṭā devatā //	Thereupon they saw and spread the sacrifice. Hence, when he prepares the Prâyanîya rice-pap for Aditi, he does so for the purpose of his seeing the sacrifice: 'After seeing the sacrifice I shall buy (the Soma) and spread that (sacrifice);' thus thinking he prepares the Prâyanîya pap for Aditi. The sacrificial food had been prepared, but offering had not yet been made to the deity (Aditi),--
athaibhyaḥ pathyā svastiḥ prārocata /	When Pathyâ Svasti appeared to them.
tāmayajanvāgvai pathyā svastirvāgyajñastadyajñamapaśyaṃstamatanvata //	They offered to her, for Pathyâ Svasti (the wishing of 'a happy journey') is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech.
tamayajantsa yadāgneyaṃ yajñasyāsīttadapaśyanyadvai śuṣkaṃ yajñasya tadāgneyaṃ tadapaśyaṃstadatanvata //	Thereby they perceived the sacrifice and spread it. Thereupon Agni appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they perceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Agni's nature.
athaibhyaḥ somaḥ prārocata / tamayajantsa yatsaumyaṃ yajñasyāsīttadapaśyanyadvā ārdraṃ yajñasya tatsaumyaṃ tadapaśyaṃstadatanvata //	Then Soma appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they perceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Soma's nature. Now of Soma's nature is what is moist in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived and spread.
athaibhyaḥ savitā prārocata /	Then Savitri appeared to them: they offered to him.
tamayajanpaśavo vai savitā paśavo yajñastadyajñamapaśyaṃstamatanvatātha yasyai devatāyai havirniruptamāsottāmayajan //	Now Savitri represents cattle, and the sacrifice also means cattle: hence they thereby perceived and spread the sacrifice. Thereupon they offered to the deity (Aditi), for whom the sacrificial food had been prepared.
pañca devatā yajati yo vai sa yajño mugdha āsītpāṅkto vai sa āsīttametābhiḥ pañcabhirdevatābhiḥ prājānan //	It is to these same five deities, then, that he offers. For that sacrifice, when thrown into disorder,was in five parts; and by means of those five deities they recognised it.
tānetābhireva pañcabhirdevatābhih prājānan //	The seasons became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities they recognised them.
tā etābhireva pañcabhirdevatābhiḥ prājānan //	The regions became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities they recognised them.

prācīmeva diśam / agninā prājānaṃstasmādagnim paścātprāñcamuddhṛtyopāsate prācīṃ hyetena diśam prājānanprācī hyetasya dik //	Through Agni they recognised the eastern region: wherefore they take out Agni from behind towards the east , and render homage to him; for through him they recognised the eastern region, and to him belongs the eastern region.
somena prājānaṃstasmātsomaṃ krītaṃ dakṣiṇā parivahanti tasmādāhuḥ pitṛdevatyaḥ soma iti dakṣiṇāṃ hyetena diśam prājānandakṣiṇā hyetasya dik //	Through Soma they recognised the southern region: hence, after the Soma has been bought, they drive it round on the south side; and hence they say that Soma is sacred to the Fathers; for through him they recognised the southern region, and to him belongs the southern region.
savitrā prājānanneṣa vai savitā ya eṣa tapati tasmādeṣa pratyaṅṅeti pratīcīṃ hyetena diśam prājānanpratīcī hyetasya dik //	Through Savitri they recognised the western region, for Savitri is yonder burning (sun): wherefore he goes towards the west, for through him they recognised the western region, and to him belongs the western region.

But the arms are on both sides of the head, and hence those two oblations, the Prâyanîya and Udayanîya, are made on both sides of (before and after) the reception.

The pot (in which the rice-pap was cooked) he puts aside with the parched remains of dough, and (so he does) the pot-ladle after wiping it. And the priests who officiate during the Prâyanîya, officiate also at the Udayanîya. And because of this identical performance at the sacrifice the two arms are alike and of the same shape.
tadu tathā na kuryāt /	But let him not do it in this way.

The priests who officiate during the Prâyanîya, officiate also at the Udayanîya; but should they (in themean time) have departed this life, others may officiate instead. It is because he offers to the same deities, and the same oblations, that the two arms are alike and of the same shape.
sa vai pañca prāyaṇīye devatā yajati /	To five deities he offers at the Prâyanîya, and to five at the Udayanîya: hence there are five fingers here and five there.

For the arms are on the fore-part of the body, and the fore-part of the sacrifice he perfects by this (opening ceremony). This is why it ends with the Samyu, and why no Patnîsamyâgas are performed.

The gods desired,--'Would that Soma came to us: we might sacrifice with him, when come.' They created those two illusions, Suparnî and Kadrû. In the chapter on the hearths (dhishnya ) it is set forth how that affair of Suparnî and Kadrû came to pass.
tebhyo gāyatrī somamacāpatat /	Gâyatrî flew up to Soma for them.
tasyā āharantyai gandharvo viśvāvasuḥ paryamuṣṇātte devā aviduḥ pracyuto vai parastātsomo 'tha no nāgacati gandharvā vai paryamoṣiṣuriti //	While she was carrying him off, the Gandharva Visvâvasu stole him from her. The gods were aware of this,--'Soma has indeed been removed from yonder (sky), but he comes not to us, for the Gandharvas have stolen him.'
yoṣitkāmā vai gandharvā vācamevaibhyaḥ prahiṇavāma sā naḥ saha somenāgamiṣyatīti tebhyo vācam prāhiṇvantsaināntsaha somenāgacat //	They said, 'The Gandharvas are fond of women: let us send Vâk (speech) to them, and she will return to us together with Soma.' They sent Vâk to them, and she returned to them together with Soma.
somo yuṣmākaṃ vāgevāsmākamiti tatheti devā abruvanniho cedāgānmaināmabhīṣaheva naiṣṭa vihvayāmahā iti tāṃ vyahvayanta //	The Gandharvas came after her and said, 'Soma (shall be) yours, and Vâk ours !' 'So be it!' said the gods; 'but if she would rather come hither, do not ye carry her off by force: let us woo her!' They accordingly wooed her.
tasyai gandharvāḥ / vedāneva procira iti vai vayaṃ vidmeti vayaṃ vidmeti //	The Gandharvas recited the Vedas to her, saying, 'See how we know it, see how we know it !'

She turned to the gods; but, in truth, she turned to them vainly, since she turned away from those, engaged in praising and praying, to dance and song. Wherefore even to this day women are given to vain things: for it was on this wise that Vâk turned thereto, and other women do as she did. And hence it is to him who dances and sings that they most readily take a fancy .
tadvā etadubhayaṃ deveṣvāsīt /	Both Soma and Vâk were thus with the gods.

When he says, 'Unite therewith,' he means to say, 'Mingle therewith;' and when he says, 'Obtain splendour,'--splendour meaning Soma,--he means to say, 'Obtain Soma.'
tāṃ yathaivādo devāḥ / prāhiṇvantsomamacaivamevaināmeṣa etatprahiṇoti somamaca vāgvai somakrayaṇī nidānena tāmetayāhutyā prīṇāti prītayā somaṃ krīṇānīti //	And as the gods then sent her (Vâk) to Soma, so does he now send her to Soma; and the cow for which the Soma is bought being in reality Vâk, it is her he gratifies by this offering, thinking, 'With her, when gratified, I shall buy the Soma.'

juṣṭā viṣṇava iti /	'Well-pleasing to Vishnu,' whereby he means to say, 'Well-pleasing to Soma whom we approach .' [He proceeds, Vâg. S. IV,

tanmanuṣyeṣu hiraṇyaṃ karoti sa yatsahiraṇyaṃ juhuyātparāgu haivaitanmanuṣyebhyo hiraṇyam pravṛñjyāttanna manuṣyeṣu hiraṇyamabhigamyeta //	Thereupon he takes out the piece of gold (from the spoon), whereby he bestows gold on men; but were he to offer (the butter) together with the gold, he would doubtless cast the gold away from men, and no gold would then be gained among men.

When, having offered the whole milk, he now says, 'Thou art pure . . . ,' it is indeed pure, and shining, and immortal, and sacred to all the gods. Having loosened the grass-blade, he throws it on the barhis, and ties a string round the gold .

They open the (south and east) doors of the hall (and walk out). On the right side (of the front door) approaches the Soma-cow : (by having) her thus put forward , he has sent her forth (to Soma); for the Soma-cow is in reality Vâk: it is her he has gratified by this offering, thinking, 'With her, when gratified, I will buy Soma.'

This is why he says, 'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward and successful (in coming) back!'

For that rope, doubtless, is of Varuna; and were she (the cow) tied with a rope, she would be (under the power) of Varuna. And, on the other hand, were she not tied at all, she would be uncontrolled. Now that which is of Mitra is not of Varuna; and as (a cow), if tied with a rope, is under control, so it is in the case of this one when he says, 'May Mitra bind thee by the foot!'

Indra truly is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'To Soma for the sake of Indra.' 'May Rudra guide thee back!' this he says for her safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra .

They lead her (the Soma-cow) northwards round (to the place where the Soma is to be sold); for the north is the quarter of men, and hence it is that of the sacrificer for this reason they lead her northwards round.

For when the metres were produced from Vâk (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the Sakvarî, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints.

'May Brihaspati make thee rest in happiness!'--Brihaspati being the Brahman, he thereby means to say, 'May Brihaspati lead thee hither by means of the good (work) !' 'Rudra, together with the Vasus, is well-pleased with thee:' this he says to secure her (the cow's) safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.

And the clarified butter being a thunderbolt, he now delivers her (the cow) by means of that thunderbolt, the butter; and by delivering her he makes her his own.

Thrice he draws round it, so that he encompasses it on all sides with a threefold thunderbolt, for no one to trespass upon it.
asme ramasveti yajamāne ramasvetyevaitadāhātha samullikhya padaṃ sthālyāṃ saṃvapatyasme te bandhuriti yajamāne te bandhurityevaitadāha //	He draws the lines (with the texts), 'Rejoice in us!' whereby he means to say, 'Rejoice in the sacrificer!' Having then, by tracing, cut out the foot-print all round , he throws it into the pan, with, 'In us is thy kinship,' whereby he means to say, 'In the sacrificer is thy kinship.'

The sacrificer receives it with, 'With me is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'with me is cattle.'
athādhvaryurātmānamupaspṛśati / mā vayaṃ rāyaspoṣeṇa viyauṣmeti tatho hādhvaryuḥ paśubhya ātmānaṃ nāntareti //	The Adhvaryu then touches himself (near the heart), with, 'May we not be deprived of prosperity!' Thus the Adhvaryu does not exclude himself from (the possession of) cattle.
atha patnyai padam pratiparāharanti /	Thereupon they hand (the dust of) the footprint over to the (sacrificer's) wife.
gṛhā vai patnyai pratiṣṭhā tadgṛheṣvevaināmetatpratiṣṭāyām pratiṣṭhāpayati tasmātpatnyai padam pratiparāharanti //	The house being the wife's resting-place, he thereby establishes her in that safe resting-place, the house: for this reason he hands over the (earth of the) foot-print to the wife.
tāṃ neṣṭā vācayati /	The Neshtri makes her say, 'Thine, thine is wealth;' whereupon he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow.

She thereby asks a blessing: a hero meaning a son, she thereby means to say, 'May I obtain a son in thy sight!'
sā yā babhruḥ piṅgākṣī /	One that is brown, with red-brown eyes, is (fit to be) a Soma-cow.

And if he be unable to obtain a brown one with red-brown eyes, let it be a dark-red one. And if he be unable to obtain a dark-red one, let it be a ruddy one, one of the[paragraph continues] Vritra-killer's own.
sā syādapravītā /	Let it be one that is not impregnated.

Let it be one that is neither tailless, nor hornless, nor one-eyed, nor ear-less , nor specially marked, nor seven-hoofed ;--for such a one is uniform, and uniform is this speech.
padaṃ samupya pāṇī avanenikte /	Having thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the Adhvaryu) washes his hands.
tadyatpāṇī avanenikte vajro vā ājyaṃ retaḥ somo nedvajreṇājyena retaḥ somaṃ hinasānīti tasmātpāṇī avanenikte //	Now as to why he washes his hands;--clarified butter being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands lest he should injure the seed, Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee.
athāsyāṃ hiraṇyam badhnīte /	Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger ).

And gold having sprung from Agni's seed, he ties the gold to this (finger), in order that he may touch the twigs (of the Soma) with the truth, that he may handle the Soma by means of the truth.

Let some shining (cloth) be the Soma-cloth; for this is to be his (king Soma's ) garment, and shining indeed is his garment: and whosoever serves him with a shining (garment), he truly shines. But he who says, '(Bring) anything whatsoever,' he will indeed be anything whatsoever: let the Soma-cloth, therefore, be some splendid (cloth), and the Soma-wrapper one of any kind.

Either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer takes the Soma-cloth, and some one or other the Soma-wrapper.
athāgreṇa rājānaṃ vicinvanti /	Now, in the first place, they pick the king (Soma).

Say thou, for me, unto Soma, ""This is thy trishtubh-part!"" Say thou, for me, unto Soma, ""This is thy gayatî-part!"" Say thou, for me, unto Soma, ""Obtain thou the supreme sovereignty of the names of metres!""' Now, when he (king Soma) is bought, he is bought for one (destination )--for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres; and when they press him, they slay him: hereby now he says to him, 'It is for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres that I buy thee, not for slaying thee.' Having gone there, he sits down (behind the Soma) with his face towards the east."

'Let the pickers pick thee!' this he says for the sake of completeness.

But let him not do this; for--the Soma being the nobility and the other plants the common people, and thepeople being the nobleman's food--it would be just as if one were to take hold of and pull out some (food) he has put in his mouth, and throw it away. Hence let him merely touch it, with, 'Let the pickers pick thee!' Those pickers of his do indeed pick it.

Thereon he metes out the king (Soma); and because he metes out the king, therefore there is a measure,--both the measure among men and whatever other measure there is.
savitā vai devānām prasavitā tatho hāsmā eṣa savitṛprasūta eva krayāya bhavati //	He metes out, with a verse to Savitri; for Savitri is the impeller of the gods, and so that (Soma) becomes for him impelled by Savitri to the purchase.
aticandasā mimīte /	He metes out with an atikhandas-verse; for that one, viz.
eṣā vai sarvāṇi candāṃsi yadaticandāstathā hāsyaiṣa sarvaireva candobhirmito bhavati tasmādaticandasā mimīte // sa mimīte /	the atikhandas , embraces all metres; and so that (Soma) is meted out for him by means of all the metres: therefore he metes out with an atikhandas-verse.

yadvevodācaṃ nyācam mimīte /	This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.
imā evaitannānāvīryāḥ karoti tasmādimā nānāvīryāstasmādvā udācaṃ nyācam mimīte // yadvevodācaṃ nyācam mimīte /	And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he thereby renders them of varied power, and hence these (fingers) are of variedpower. That is why he metes out in bending them up and down.
virājamevaitadarvācīṃ ca parācīṃ ca yunakti parācyaha devebhyo yajñaṃ vahatyarvācī manuṣyānavati tasmādvā udācaṃ nyācam mimīte //	And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he thereby harnesses a virâg (to ply) thitherwards and hitherwards: going thither-wards, namely, it conveys the sacrifice to the gods, and coming hitherwards it assists men.
atha yaddaśa kṛtvo mimīte /	This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.
daśākṣarā vai virāḍvairājaḥ somastasmāddaśa kṛtvo mimīte //	And as to his meting out ten times,--the virâg is of ten syllables, and the Soma is of virâg nature: for this reason he metes out ten times.

He then makes a finger-hole in the middle (of the knot), with the text, 'Let the descendants breathe after thee!' For, in compressing (the cloth), he, as it were, strangles him (Soma and the sacrificer) and renders him breathless; hereby now he emits his breath from inside, and after him breathing the descendants also breathe: for this reason he says, 'Let the descendants breathe after thee.' Thereupon he hands him (Soma) to the Soma-seller.
sa vai rājānam paṇate /	Now, then, of the bargain.

He says, 'Soma-seller, is thy king Soma for sale?'--'He is for sale,' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee!'--'Buy him!' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee for one-sixteenth (of the cow).'--'King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!' says the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more than that; but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,' says the Adhvaryu.
tasyai śṛtaṃ tasyai śarastasyai dadhi tasyai mastu tasyā ātañcanaṃ tasyai navanītaṃ tasyai ghṛtaṃ tasyā āmikṣā tasyai vājinam //	'From the cow (comes) fresh milk, from her boiled milk, from her cream, from her sour curds, from her sour cream, from her curdled milk, from her butter, from her ghee, from her clotted curds, from her whey:

And because they first bargain and afterwards come to terms, therefore about any and everything that is for sale here, people first bargain and afterwardscome to terms. And the reason why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma, is that Soma is already glorified, since Soma is a god. And the Adhvaryu thereby glorifies the cow, thinking, 'Seeing her virtues he shall buy her!' This is why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma.
atha yatpañca kṛtvaḥ paṇate / saṃvatsarasammito vai yajñaḥ pañca vā ṛtavaḥ saṃvatsarasya tam pañcabhirāpnoti tasmātpañca kṛtvaḥ paṇate //	And as to his bargaining five times:--the sacrifice being of equal measure with the year, and there being five seasons in the year, he thus obtains it (the sacrifice, Soma) in five (divisions), and therefore he bargains five times.

'Thou art bought with the most excellent animal,' because she brings forth three times in the year, she is the most excellent of animals. 'May I increase with a thousandfold increase!' Thereby he implores a blessing: a thousand meaning abundance, he thereby means to say, 'May I obtain abundance!'

Having pushed back the garment on the sacrificer's right thigh, he lays him (Soma) down thereon, with the text, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh,'--for he, the sacrificer, is at present Indra : therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh;'--'willing on the willing,' whereby he means to say, 'beloved on the beloved one;'--'tender on the tender!' whereby he means to say, 'propitious on the propitious one.'

Now those (Gandharvas) are instead of the hearth-mounds--these being the names of the hearth-mounds--it is these very (names) that he thereby has assigned to them .

Now it is he (Soma ) that becomes an embryo, and therefore he is enveloped, since embryos are, as it were, enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane.

Now he (Soma) approaches him while he is seated, and when he has come, he rises: thereby he does wrong and breaks the vow. This, then, is his expiation of that (transgression), and thus no wrong is thereby done, and he breaks not the vow: therefore he says, 'Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways!'

And so does he now ward off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, and attain wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. For this reason he says, 'We have entered upon the path that leadeth to well-being, free from danger; whereon he escheweth all haters and meeteth with good.'

Thereon he places him (Soma), with, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!' for Aditi being this (earth), and she being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that safe resting-place: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!'

For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin,'thereby they rendered it (the sacrifice or Soma) superior to the deadly shaft .

'Verily, all these are Varuna's ordinances;'--thereby he makes here everything whatsoever obedient to him, and every one that is refractory: therefore he says, 'Verily, all these are Varuna's ordinances.'

He thereby places Sûrya (the sun) in front, thinking, 'May Sûrya, in front, ward off the evil spirits!' They now drive (Soma) about on a safe (cart), unmolested by evil spirits.

He (Soma), indeed, is too high for (the driver) mounting beside him, for who is worthy of mounting beside him? Therefore he drives while standing between (the boards).

'May that which was there of the Soma nature, be here also now!' so he thinks, and for this reason he drives with a palâsa branch.

Even his (Soma's own) kings come (tohim) to attend the assembly, and he is the first to salute the kings, for he is gracious. This is why he says, 'Thou art gracious.' 'Go forth, O Lord of the world,' he says, because he (Soma) is the lord of beings. 'To all dwellings,' 'all dwellings' doubtless means the limbs; with reference to his limbs he says this, 'May no prowling enemies meet thee! may no waylayers meet thee! May no malicious wolves meet thee!' this he says lest the evil spirits should meet him on his way.

atha śarīramevānvavahanti /	Now they (can) only hit his body .

'Subrahmanyôm! Subrahmanyôm! Subrahmanyôm!' thus he calls, for the Brahman indeed moves the gods onward. Thrice he says it, because the sacrifice is threefold.

Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'Come, O Indra!' 'Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of Medhâtithi ! Wife of Vrishanasva ! Bestriding buffalo! Lover of Ahalyâ !' Thereby he wishes him joy in those affairs of his.

Just so has this (formula) been devised in these days by Âruni, to wit, 'thou who callest thee Gautama:' he may say it, if he choose, and if he does not choose, he need not attend to it . 'In so and so many days, to the Soma-feast,' (stating) in how many days from hence the pressing is to be.

Now Agni and Soma have seized him, who consecrates himself, between their jaws, for that consecration-offering above belongs to Agni and Vishnu, and Vishnu, forsooth, is no other than[paragraph continues] Soma, and the offering is he himself who is consecrated: thus they have seized him between their jaws; and by this victim he now redeems himself .

But let him not do this; for wheresoever these two are, there they are indeed together.

If he be unable to obtain a black-spotted buck, it may be a red-spotted one.

Thereby he renders homage to it (the victim) and makes it a token of the covenant.

With 'Ye two are the rest of Varuna's stay,' he pulls out the two wedges. The reason why he says, 'Ye two are the rest of Varuna's stay ,' is that he, the bought Soma, now indeed is of Varuna .
atha catvāro rājāsandīmādadate / dvau vā asmai mānuṣāya rājña ādadāte athaitāṃ catvāro yo 'sya sakṛtsarvasyeṣṭe //	Thereupon four men take up the king's throne; two men, it is true, take it up for the human king, but four take up this for him who rules over everything here.
audumbarī bhavati / annaṃ vā ūrgudumbara ūrjo 'nnādyasyāvaruddhyai tasmādaudumbarī bhavati //	It is of udumbara wood--udumbara meaning sap and food--for (the sacrificer's) obtainment of sap and food: therefore it is of udumbara wood.

Moreover, there is the seat of the seed, and Soma is seed: therefore it reaches up to his navel.

He then spreads on it the black deerskin with, 'Thou art the rightful seat (ritasadanam) of Varuna!' and places him (Soma) thereon with, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varuna!' The reason why he says, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varuna,' is that he (Soma) is now of Varuna's nature.

Go forth to our dwellings, O Soma, prospering our homes, ever helpful, bestowing abundance of men, not slaying ourmen!' dwellings meaning houses, he thereby means to say, 'Go forth to our houses, kind, propitious, not doing evil.'

But let him not do this, for they (who do this) do at the sacrifice what is human, and inauspicious for the sacrifice forsooth is that which is human: let him therefore not pour out water, lest he should do at the sacrifice what is inauspicious.

But the arms are on both sides of the head: therefore those two oblations, the Prâyanîya and Udayanîya, are on both sides of the guest-offering.

He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer's) guest,--to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat--for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods--so he prepares for him that guest-offering.
pūrvo 'tītya gṛhṇīyāditi yatra vā arhantamāgataṃ nāpacāyanti krudhyati vai sa tatra tathā hāpacito bhavati //	Here now they say, 'Let him first walk past (Soma) and take out (the material for offering)!' For (they argue) where people do not show respectto a worthy person (arhant) who has come to them, he becomes angry,--and in this way he (Soma) is indeed honoured.
tadvā anyatara eva vimuktaḥ syāt / anyataro 'vimukto 'tha gṛhṇīyātsa yadanyataro vimuktastenāgato yadvanyataro 'vimuktastenāpacitaḥ //	Then only one (of the oxen) is to be unyoked, and the other to be left unyoked ; and thereupon he is to take out (the material for offering): for (they argue) in that one of them is unyoked, thereby he (Soma) has arrived; and in that the other is left unyoked, thereby he is honoured.

And accordingly, in human practice, so long as (a guest) has not unyoked, people do not bring water to him and show him no honour, for so long he has not yet arrived; but when he has unyoked, then they bring him water and show him honour, for then he has indeed arrived: let him therefore take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking and after making (Soma) enter (the hall).
sa vai saṃtvaramāṇa iva gṛhṇīyāt /	Let him take it out with all speed, for thus he (Soma) is honoured.

Thus they enclose him on the two sides by a (married) couple: and, indeed, wherever aworthy person comes, there all the inmates of the house bestir themselves, for thus he is honoured.

The metres act as attendants about him; even as the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, (attend upon) the king, so do the metres act as attendants about him (Soma).

sa gṛhṇāti / agnestanūrasi viṣṇave tvetyagnirvai gāyatrī tadgāyatrīmanvābhajati //	He takes it out, with the text , 'Thou art Agni's body,--thee (I take) for Vishnu!' the Gâyatrî is Agni: to Gâyatrî he thus assigns her share.
somasya tanūrasi viṣṇave tveti / kṣatraṃ vai somaḥ kṣatraṃ triṣṭuptattriṣṭubhamanvābhajati //	'Thou art Soma's body,--thee for Vishnu!' Soma is the nobility, and the Trishtubhis the nobility: to Trishtubh he thus assigns her share.
atitherātithyamasi viṣṇave tveti / so 'syoddhāro yathā śreṣṭhasyoddhāra evamasyaiṣa ṛte candobhyaḥ //	'Thou art the guest's hospitable entertainment ,--thee for Vishnu!' This is his (Soma's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the metres.
śyenāya tvā somabhṛte viṣṇave tveti /	'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon! thee for Vishnu!' thereby he assigns to Gâyatrî her share.
tadgāyatrīmanvābhajati sā yadgāyatrī śyeno bhūtvā divaḥ somamāharattena sā śyenaḥ somabhṛttenaivaināmetadvīryeṇa dvitīyamanvābhajati //	Because Gâyatrî, in the form of a falcon, carried off Soma from the sky, therefore she is the Soma-bearing falcon: in virtue of that heroic deed he now assigns to her a second share.
agnaye tvā rāyaspoṣade viṣṇave tveti / paśavo vai rāyaspoṣaḥ paśavo jagatī tajjagatīmanvābhajati //	'Thee for Agni, the bestower of prosperity! thee for Vishnu!' Prosperity means cattle, and the Gagatî (the moving, living one) means cattle: to Gagatî he thereby assigns her share.

And as to his taking it with 'For Vishnu (I take) thee! for Vishnu thee!' it is because he who takes out (material) for the sacrifice, takes it for Vishnu.

devā ha vā etaṃ vanaspatiṣu rākṣoghnaṃ dadṛśuryatkārṣmaryaṃ śiro vai yajñasyātithyaṃ neciro yajñasya nāṣṭrā rakṣāṃsi hinasanniti tasmātkārṣmaryamayāḥ paridhayo bhavanti //	The enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea ), for the gods, once upon a time, perceived that one, the kârshmarya, to be the Rakshas-killer among trees. Now, the guest-offering being the head of the sacrifice, the enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood, in order that the evil spirits may not injure the head of the sacrifice.
āśvavālaḥ prastaraḥ /	The prastara-bunch is of asvavâla-grass (Saccharum Spontaneum).

It became a horse (asva) and sped away from them. The gods, rushing after it, took hold of its tail (vâla) and tore it out; and having torn it out, they threw it down in a lump, and what had been the hairs of the horse's tail then grew up as those plants (of asvavâla-grass). Now the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the tail is the hind-part (of animals): hence by the prastara being of asvavâla-grass he encompasses the sacrifice on both sides.
aikṣavyau vidhṛtī /	There are two vidhritis of sugar-cane, lestthe barhis and the prastara should become mixed up together.
nedbarhiśca prastaraśca saṃlubhyāta ityathotpūyājyaṃ sarvāṇyeva caturgṛhītānyājyāni gṛhṇāti na hyatrānuyājā bhavanti //	Having then purified the ghee , he takes all the butter-portions in four ladlings , for at this (sacrifice) there are no after-offerings.
āsādya havīṃṣyagnim manthati /	When he has placed the sacrificial dishes (on the altar) , he churns the fire.

Further, Agni means all the gods, since offering is made in the fire to all gods; and the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice: hence, through all the deities, he secures success to the sacrifice from the very head (beginning).
so 'dhimanthanaṃ śakalamādatte /	This is why he churns the fire .
agnerjanitramasītyatra hyagnirjāyate tasmādāhāgnerjanitramasīti //	He takes the bottom piece of wood , with the text , 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni;' for it is thereon that Agni is produced: hence he says, 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni.'
vṛṣaṇau stha iti tadyāvevemau striyai sākaṃjāvetāvevaitau //	Thereon he lays two sprouts of a kusa stalk (with the tops towards the east), with, 'Ye aremales ;' thereby these two are as two (sons) born together here from a woman.

He then touches the (ghee in the) ghee-pan with the upper churning-stick, with, 'Thou art Âyu,' he puts it down (on the lower arani) with, 'Thou art Purûravas.' For Urvasî was a nymph, and Purûravas was her husband; and the (child) which sprung from that union was Âyu : in like manner does he now produce the sacrifice from that union.
sa manthati /	Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to Agni, as he is churned !'

For it is with the metres that he churns him (Agni, the fire); the metres he recites to him when he is churned, whereby he attaches the metres to the sacrifice, even as the rays (are attached) to yonder sun.--'Recite to the born one!' he says,when he (Agni) is produced ; and 'To him who is thrown !' when he throws him (on the old Âhavanîya fire).
so 'nupraharati / bhavataṃ naḥ samanasau sacetasāvarepasau mā yajñaṃ hiṃsiṣṭam mā yajñapatiṃ jātavedasau śivau bhavatamadya na iti śāntimevābhyāmetadvadati yathā nānyo 'nyaṃ hiṃsyātām //	He throws (the fire on the hearth), with the text , 'For our sake be ye two (fires) friendly to one another, of one mind, unblemished! Injure not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice! be gracious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He thus bespeaks peacefulness between them, that they may not injure each other.

For the purpose of offering they have produced him, and by this offering he has now gratified him: that is why he thus makes offering unto him.

But were he to perform the after-offerings, it would be as if, by reversing, he were to put the feet in the place of the head. Hence it ends with the Idâ, and no after-offerings are performed.

Brihaspati with the All-gods, say some , but, indeed, those who separated into four parties were 'all the gods.' When they were separated, the Asura-Rakshas came after them and entered between them.

Let us come to an agreement and yield to the excellence of one of us!' They yielded to the excellence of Indra; wherefore it is said, 'Indra is all the deities, the gods have Indra for their chief.'

For he who, knowing this, quarrels not, does what displeases his enemies andfalls not a prey to his enemies: let him therefore not quarrel.

And even now the gods do not transgress that (covenant), for how would they fare, were theyto transgress it?--they would speak untruth, and verily there is one law which the gods do keep, namely, the truth. It is through this that their conquest, their glory is unassailable: and so, forsooth, is his conquest, his glory unassailable whosoever, knowing this, speaks the truth. Now, the Tânûnaptra is really that same (covenant of the gods).

He that blows yonder (the wind) does indeed rush onward and rush about; and it is for him that he takes (the butter): therefore he says, 'for him that rushes onward, for him that rushes about, I take thee.'

'The strength of the gods' doubtless means the favourite forms and desirable powers of the gods, 'uncursed, curse-averting, uncursable,' for the gods have overcome every curse;--'May I straightway go to the truth!' whereby he means to say, 'May I speak the truth, may I not transgress this (covenant);'--'Establish me in welfare!' for in welfare the gods indeed established themselves by speaking the truth, by performing the truth: therefore he says, 'Establish me in welfare!'

Hence, if many persons perform the consecration , let it (the Tânûnaptra butter), after pouring the fast-milk to it, be handed only to the master of the house, since he, among them, is the representative of Indra. And if he perform the consecration by means of an (offering) with a dakshinâ, let them hand it (the butter) to the sacrificer, after pouring the fast-milk to it, for thus it is said,--'The Sacrificer is Indra.'

They turned in their fingers more tightly and drew their zone tighter, whereby they produced offspring for themselves.

They came together, upbraiding one another, saying, 'See, what thou hast clone to me! see, how thou hast struck me!' But Agni alone did not speak thus to any one, nor did any one speak thus to Agni.

They accordingly became like Agni, and thereby escaped from the Rakshas and attained to the heavenly world. And in like manner does this one now become like Agni, and thereby escape from the Rakshas and attain to the heavenly world.

May my vows be bound up with thine, O lord of vows!' whereby he envelops himself with the skin by means of Agni, 'May the lord of consecration approve myconsecration, and the lord of penance my penance!' Thereby he enters upon the intermediary consecration.

The reason why, after touching the lustral water, they strengthen the king is this;--ghee is a thunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence they strengthen the king after touching the lustral water, lest they should injure the seed, Soma, by the thunderbolt, the ghee.

But let him not do this. For such indeed was the course of the sacrificial performance: discord arose between them (the gods) thereat; they attained to their former tranquillity; then the Avântaradîkshâ and finally the strengthening.

'Soma, forsooth, was Vritra; his body is the same as the mountains and rocks: thereon grows that plant called Usânâ,'--so said Svetaketu Auddâlaki;[paragraph continues] 'they fetch it hither and press it; and by means of the consecration and the Upasads, by the Tânûnaptra and the strengthening they make it into Soma.' And in like manner does he now make it into Soma by means of the consecration and the Upasads, by the Tânûnaptra and the strengthening.

yajñena vai devāḥ /	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield.

Having sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey, and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared; and because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post).

The sacrifice is speech: hence he thereby again supplies what part of the sacrifice here has been sucked out and drained.

For verily every one of those stalks swells to fill a hundred or ten ekadhana cups for the several gods. 'May Indra wax strong for thee, and wax thou strong for Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus strengthens him who is the deity of the sacrifice. By saying, 'Wax thou strong for Indra,' he instils that invigorating draught into him. 'Strengthen us friends with gain and understanding!' 'With gain' he says with reference to what he gains; and 'with understanding' he says with reference to what he recites. 'Mayest thou thrive, O divine Soma, and may I attain to the Soma-feast!' They, the priests and sacrificer, have one prayer in common, 'May we reach the end of the sacrifice!' hence he thereby means to say, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'

Now the prastara also is (part of) the sacrifice, and by (touching) it they again get hold of the sacrifice. And this is his expiation of that (transgression); and so no wrong is committed by them and they are not cut off from the gods: for this reason they make amends on the prastara.
tadāhuḥ / akte nihnuvīrānanaktā ityanakte haiva nihnuvīrannanupraharaṇaṃ hyevāktasya // te nihnuvate /	Here now they say, 'On the anointed?--let them rather make amends on the unanointed !' They should indeed make amends on the un-anointed (prastara), since anointed it is thrown into the fire.

He hands it to the Agnîdh, and the Agnîdh puts it aside (in a safe place).

Hence they say, 'A castle is conquered by siege;' for it is indeed by beleaguering that one of these human castles is taken.

And so does he cleave these worlds by that thunderbolt, the ghee, and conquer these worlds; therefore they (the Upasads) have ghee for their offering material.

He takes eight times in the guhû, and four times in the upabhrit.

He makes only the one libation (âghâra) which (he makes) with the dipping-spoon (sruva) .

And the reason why he offers to those deities is that he thereby constructs the thunderbolt: Agni (he makes) the point (anîka), Soma the barb (salya), and Vishnu the connecting piece (kulmala) .
saṃvatsaro hi vajraḥ / agnirvā ahaḥ somo rātriratha yadantareṇa tadviṣṇuretadvai pariplavamānaṃ saṃvatsaraṃ karoti //	For the thunderbolt is the year the day is Agni, the night Soma, and what is between the two, that is Vishnu.

The thunderbolt is the year: by that year, as a thunderbolt, the gods clove the strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he now by that year, as a thunderbolt, cleave these worlds, and conquer these worlds. This is why he offers to those gods.

When he performs (the upasads), he fights; and when (the performance) is completed, he conquers; and when he offers the Homa , he enters that (stronghold) now his own.

atho api trayastriṃśatsyuḥ / trayastriṃśadakṣarā vai virāḍvirājaivāsmiṃloke pratitiṣṭhati //	But there may also be thirty-three (steps); for of thirty-three syllables also consists the Virâg; and by means of the Virâg, he obtains a firm footing in this world.

caturviṃśatyakṣarā vai gāyatrī pūrvārdho vai yajñasya gāyatrī pūrvārdhe eṣa yajñasya tasmāccaturviṃśativikramā purastādbhavatyeṣā mātrā vedeḥ //	And as to (the altar) being twenty-four steps broad in front;--the Gâyatrî consists of twenty-four syllables, and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice: this is why it is twenty-four steps broad in front.
atha yatpaścādvarīyasī bhavati /	This is the measure of the altar.
paścādvarīyasī pṛthuśroṇiriti vai yoṣām praśaṃsanti yadveva paścādvarīyasī bhavati paścādevaitadvarīyaḥ prajananaṃ karoti tasmātpaścādvarīyasaḥ prajananādimāḥ prajāḥ prajāyante //	And why it is broader behind,--'Wider behind, broad-hipped,' thus they praise a woman. And by its being wider behind, he makes that womb at the hind-part (of the altar) wider, and from that wider womb these creatures are born.
nāsikā ha vā eṣā yajñasya yaduttaravediḥ / atha yadenāmuttarāṃ vederupakirati tasmāduttaravedirnāma //	That high altar (Uttaravedi ) is the nose of the sacrifice; because they throw it up so as to be higher than the altar, therefore it is called 'high altar.'
dvayyo ha vā idamagre prajā āsuḥ /	Now, in the beginning there were two kinds of beings here, the Âdityas and the Aṅgiras.

upajānīta yathāsmānevāṅgiraso yājayānna vayamaṅgirasa iti // te hocuḥ /	The Âdityas spake (to one another), 'Contrive ye how the Aṅgiras shall minister unto us, and not we unto the Aṅgiras!'

They brought together the (materials for) sacrifice, and having made ready the sacrifice, they said, 'Agni, thou hast announced to us a Soma-feast for to-morrow; but we announce to thee and the Aṅgiras a Soma-feast even for to-day: it is for us that thou art (to officiate as) Hotri !'
aṅgiraso 'ca te hāpyaṅgiraso 'gnaye 'nvāgatya cukrudhuriva kathaṃ nu no dūtaścaranna pratyādṛthā iti //	They sent back some other (messenger) to the Aṅgiras; but the Aṅgiras going after Agni, were exceeding angry with him, saying, 'Going as our messenger, why didst thou not mind us ?'
anindyā vai māvṛṣata so nindyairvṛto nāśakamapakramitumiti tasmādu hānindyasya vṛto nāpakrāmetta etena sadyaḥkriyāṅgirasa ādityānayājayantsa sadyaḥkrīḥ //	He spake, 'The blameless chose me: as the chosen of the blameless, I could not go away.' And let not therefore the chosen (priest) of a blameless man turn away from him. The Aṅgiras then officiated for the Âdityas in the sacrifice with Soma bought (krî) on the same day (sadyas); whence this Sadyahkrî .
tebhyo vācaṃ dakṣiṇāmānayan /	They brought Vâk (speech) to them for their sacrificial fee.
tāṃ na pratyagṛhṇanhāsyāmahe yadi pratigrahīṣyāma iti tadu tadyajñasya karma na vyamucyata yaddākṣiṇamāsīt //	They accepted her not, saying, 'We shall be losers if we accept her.' And so the performance of that sacrifice was not discharged (completed), as it was one requiring a sacrificial fee.
athaibhyaḥ sūryaṃ dakṣiṇāmānayan /	Thereupon they brought Sûrya (the sun) to them, and they accepted him.

So saying she went away from them. Having become a lioness she went on seizing upon (everything ) between those two contending parties, the gods and the Asuras.
sā devānupāvartsyantyuvāca /	The gods called her to them, and so did the Asuras.

She then said to the gods, 'Whatsoever blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!' So she went over to the gods.

And when he raisesthe high altar, it is for the completeness of the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is Vâk (speech) and that (high altar) is Vâk.
yugena yatra haranti śamyayā yato haranti yugaśamyena vai yogyaṃ yuñjanti sā yadevādaḥ siṃhī bhūtvāśāntevācarattadevaināmetadyajñe yunakti //	He measures it with the yoke and pin;--namely with the yoke (that place) whither they take (the earth); and with a yoke-pin that, from whence they take (the earth ), for the team is harnessed with the yoke and the pin: it is because she (Vâk), as a lioness, at that time roamed about unappeased that he thus yokes her here at the sacrifice.

Hence if he have any wretched kinsman, let him give it to him; for in that he gives it away, it will not turn into a lioness and destroy him; and in that he gives it to a kinsman, he does not make over (the sacrifice) to one other than himself: and this is the settling of a refused Dakshinâ.

The measure for the pit is the same (as for the high altar) ; thereis no (other) measure in regard to it: wherever he himself may think fit in his mind (to fix it), in front of the heap of rubbish (utkara), there let him mark off the pit.
udīcīṃ śamyāṃ nidadhāti sa parilikhati taptāyanī me 'sītīmāmevaitadāhāsyāṃ hitapta eti // atha purastāt / udīcīṃ śamyāṃ nidadhāti sa parilikhati vittāyanī me 'sītīmāmevaitadāhāsyāṃ hi vividāna eti //	From the (north) edge of the altar he lays down the pin from south to north, and draws the (western) outline, with the text , 'Thou art for me the resort of the afflicted!' Thereby he means this (earth), for it is thereon that he walks afflicted. Thereupon he lays down the pin in front from south to north, and draws the outline with, 'Thou art my wealth-resort.' Thereby he means this (earth), for it is thereon that he walks having acquired (wealth).
prācīṃ śamyāṃ nidadhāti sa parilikhatyavatānmā nāthitāditīmāmevaitadāha yatra nāthaitanmāvatāditi //	He then lays down the pin along the (north) edge of the altar from west to east, and draws the outline with, 'Preserve me from being in want !' Thereby he means this (earth): 'Wherever there is want, from that preserve me!'
prācīṃ śamyāṃ nidadhāti sa parilikhatyavatānmā vyathitāditīmāmevaitadāha yatra vyathaitanmāvatāditi // atha harati /	He then lays down the pin on the north side from west to east, and draws the outline with, 'Preserve me from being afflicted !' Thereby hemeans this (earth): 'wherever there is affliction, from that preserve me!'

He flings while mentioning the names of the Agnis . For those (three) Agnis whom the gods at first chose for the office of Hotri passed away: they crept into these very earths,--namely, into this one and the two beyond it.

Go thou, O Agni, Aṅgiras, with the name of Âyu (life)!' What life they passed away from that he bestows, that he re-animates. Having with, 'Thou who art in this earth,' taken (the loose soil dug up by the wooden sword), he puts it down (on the altar ), with, 'Whatever inviolate, holy name of thine,therewith I lay thee down!' whereby he means to say, 'whatever holy name, unviolated by the Rakshas, is thine, thereby I lay thee down .'--With 'Thee, moreover, for the delight of the gods,' he takes (earth) a fourth time ; whereby he means to say, 'I take thee well-pleasing to the gods.' He takes that (high altar) from a quadrangular pit, for there are four quarters: thus he takes it from all the four quarters.

Inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a lioness and roamed about unappeased, therefore he says to her, 'Thou art a lioness;' and by 'overcoming the enemies' he means to say, 'Through thee may we worst our enemies.' 'Be thou meet for the gods' he says, because the high altar is a woman: her he thus renders meet for the gods.

In the middle he makes, as it were, a navel, thinking, 'Seated in one and the same place, I shall sprinkle (ghee) all round .'

And, the high altar being a woman, he thereby fits her for the gods: this is why he sprinkles it with water.

He then bestrews it with gravel. Now gravel certainly is an ornament, because gravel is rather shining. And that gravel being the ashes of Agni Vaisvânara, he is now about to place Agni thereon, and so Agni does not injure it: this is why he bestrews it with gravel. He bestrews it with, 'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies: array thee for the gods!' He then covers it , and thus covered it remains during that night. They put fire-wood on (the Âhavanîya fire), and prepare the underlayer (of gravel ).
upayamanīrupakalpayantyājyamadhiśrayati sruvaṃ ca srucaṃ sammārṣṭyathotpūyājyam pañcagṛhītaṃ gṛhṇīte yadā pradīpta idhmo bhavati //	He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the Gârhapatya to melt), and cleans both the dipping-spoon and the offering-spoon. Having then clarified the ghee, he ladles five times thereof (into the offering-spoon).

Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite for Agni as he is taken forward !' (and to the Pratiprasthâtri), 'Come up after me with the single sword(-line)!' The Pratiprasthâtri goes up after him with the single sword(-line) as faras that middle peg on the hind-part of the altar : whatever part of the Gârhapatya is cut off from the altar by that intermediate (peg), that he thereby carries on to (connects with) it.

atha paścātprokṣati / pracetāstvā rudraiḥ paścātpātviti pracetāstvā rudraiḥ paścādgopāyatvityevaitadāha //	He then sprinkles it behind with, 'May the Wise shield thee from behind with the Rudras!' whereby he means to say, 'May the Wise One protect thee from behind with the Rudras!'

Because she (Vâk--the altar) on that occasion became a lioness and roamed about unappeased , he thus dismisses from the sacrifice that sorrow of hers,--if he do not wish to exorcise. But should he wish to exorcise, let him indicate it by saying, 'This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice against so and so!' He then smites him with that sorrow, and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.
sa yaddhāryamāṇe 'gnau /	Now as to why he pours ghee on the high altar, while the fire is held (over it).

And because she said to the gods, 'Whatsoever blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!' therefore the priests now invoke through her that blessing upon the sacrificer, and it is fully accomplished unto him.
tadvā etadekaṃ kurvandvayaṃ karoti /	When he pours ghee on the high altar, hedoes it twofold even while doing it in one .

Then on the northern of the two back corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning the Âdityas , Hail!' Then on the southern of the two back corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning the Brahman, winning the Kshatra, Hail!' Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this one he prays for the Brahman (priesthood) and the Kshatra.
atha pūrvayoruttarasyāṃ / siṃhyasi suprajāvanī rāyaspoṣavaniḥ svāheti tatprajāmāśāste yadāha suprajāvaniriti rāyaspoṣavaniriti bhūmā vai rāyaspoṣastadbhūmānamāśāste //	Then on the northern of the front corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning abundant offspring, winning growth of wealth, Hail!' In that he says, 'winning abundant offspring,' he prays for offspring; and in that he says, 'winning growth of wealth'--growth of wealth meaning abundance--he prays for abundance.

Hail!' whereby he causes the gods to be brought to the sacrificer. He then raises the offering-spoon with, 'To thebeings thee! Hail!'--beings meaning offspring--he thereby means to say, 'To offspring thee!'

With, 'Thou art Agni's provision' he throws the 'equipments' upon (the high altar).

Let him, therefore, cut off that (tuft) which is nearest to the head, and bring it; and if he be unable to procure that, let him bring any kind (of wether's hair). And why there are enclosing-sticks?--for theprotection (of Agni): for it is somewhat long before the next enclosing-sticks will come nigh to him .
puruṣo vai yajñaḥ / puruṣastena yajño yadenam puruṣastanuta eṣa vai tāyamāno yāvāneva puruṣastāvānvidhīyate tasmātpuruṣo yajñaḥ //	The sacrifice is a man; it is a man for the reason that a man spreads (prepares) it. In being spread it is made just as large as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man.
śira evāsya havirdhānam / vaiṣṇavaṃ devatayātha yadasmintsomo bhavati havirvai devānāṃ somastasmāddhavirdhānaṃ nāma //	The Soma-cart (shed) is no other than his head, and has Vishnu for its deity . And because Soma is therein--Soma being havis (material for offering) for the gods--therefore it is called Havirdhâna (receptacle of havis).
mukhamevāsyāhavanīyaḥ / sa yadāhavanīye juhoti yathā mukha āsiñcedevaṃ tat //	The Âhavanîya is no other than his mouth: hence, when he offers on the Âhavanîya, it is as if he poured (food) into the mouth.
stupa evāsya yūpaḥ / bāhū evāsyāgnīdhrīyaśca mārjālīyaśca //	The sacrificial stake is no other than his crest-lock; and the Âgnîdhrîya and Mârgâlîya are his arms.

And because all the gods sat (sad) in it therefore it is called Sadas: and so do these Brahmans of every family now sit therein.
atha yāvetau jaghanenāgnī /	And the two fires which are behind it are his feet.

ubhayatodvāraṃ havirdhānam bhavati / ubhayatodvāraṃ sadastasmādayam puruṣa āntaṃ saṃtṛṇaḥ praṇikte havirdhāne upatiṣṭhate //	The cart-shed has doors on both sides; and so has the Sadas doors on both sides: hence this man is perforated from one end to the other.

atha punaḥ prapadya /	They fasten a front-band (to the posts of the front door ).

When he says, 'They harness the mind,' he harnesses the mind; and when he says, 'and they harness the thoughts (dhî),' he harnesses speech; for it is thereby that people seek to make their living in accordance with their respective intelligence (dhî), either by reciting (the Veda), or by readiness of speech, or by songs,--with these two thus harnessed they perform the sacrifice.

And 'of the great inspirer of devotion ,'--the great inspirer of devotion, truly, is the sacrifice: it is regarding the sacrifice that he says this. 'The knower of rites alone hath assigned the priestly offices,' for, in performingthe sacrifice, they indeed assign the priestly offices. 'Great is the praise of the divine Savitri; Hail!' Thus he offers to Savitri for his impulsion.
athāparaṃ caturgṛhītamājyaṃ gṛhītvā /	Having then taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, he walks out (of the hall by the front door).

He then lays down a piece of gold in the right wheel-track of the southern Sonia-cart, and offers thereon, with , 'Vishnu strode through this(universe),thrice he put down his foot: it is enveloped in his dust; Hail!' The residue (of ghee) he pours into the wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle with , 'Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!' He hands to his assistant both the offering-spoon and the melting-pot.
caturgṛhītamājyaṃ gṛhītvā /	They lead the wife round by the back of the two fires .

Thou proppedst asunder these two worlds, O Vishnu; with beams of light didst thou hold fast the earth on all sides; Hail!' The residue (of ghee) he pours into the wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle with,[paragraph continues] 'Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!' Then as to why he thus offers.

And in like manner does he now keep off the evil spirits from the south by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they do not come after him on his way. And the reason why he offers with two verses relating to Vishnu, is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vishnu.

She anoints in a direction away (from the cart), for away the seed is cast.
atha vācayati /	He then says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the Soma-carts as they are wheeled forward !'

The cult, namely, is the sacrifice: 'go ye both forward, furthering the sacrifice' he thereby means to say. 'Convey ye the sacrifice upward; lead it not astray !' whereby he means to say, 'convey this sacrifice upward to the world of the gods;' and by saying 'lead it not astray,' he prays for this (sacrificer) that he may notstumble. Let them wheel (the carts) forward, as it were lifting them, so that they may not creak; for of the Asuras is that voice which is in the axle : 'Lest the Asuras’ voice should speak here!' so he thinks.
etadvācayet /	But if they should creak,--
svaṃ goṣṭhamāvadataṃ devī durye āyurmā nirvādiṣṭam prajām mā nirvādiṣṭamiti tasyo haiṣā prāyaścittiḥ //	Let him make (the sacrificer) say this, 'Speak ye unto your own cow-pen, ye divine resorts; speak not my life away, speak not my offspring away!' This, then, is the expiation thereof.

But there is no (fixed) measure in this; wherever he himself may think fit in his mind, only not too near , nor too far (from the high altar), there let him stop them.
te abhimantrayate / atra ramethāṃ varṣmanpṛthivyā iti varṣma hyetatpṛthivyai bhavati divi hyasyāhavanīyo bhavati nabhyasthe karoti taddhi kṣemasya rūpam //	He salutes them with, 'May ye rejoice here on the height of the earth!' for this (altar) is verily the height (top) of the earth, since his offering-fire is in the heaven.
athottareṇa paryetyādhvaryuḥ /	He makes them rest on their naves for that is the appearance of repose.

For Vishnu (I prop) thee!' He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice .

For Vishnu thee!' He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice. The reason why he performs with prayers to Vishnu is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vishnu.

Now that (mat-covering) indeed is his (Vishnu, the shed's) upper skull-bone for thereon, as it were, the other skull-bones rest: this is why he says 'they abide on.'

He then makes him say, after touching the two upright hurdles, 'Ye are the corners of Vishnu's mouth;' for they indeed are the corners of his mouth. Then that mat which is behind there, that indeed is that skull-bone of his here behind (viz.
atha laspūjanyā spandyayā prasīvyati /	the occiput).

With, 'Thou art Vishnu's fixed (point) ,' he then makes a knot, 'lest it should fall asunder.' That same (knot) he undoes when the work is completed; and thus disease befalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. The completed (cart-shed) he touches with, 'Thou art Vishnu's own,' for the Soma-cart (and shed) belongs to Vishnu.
dvayaṃ vā abhyuparavāḥ khāyante /	It is for a twofold reason that the sounding-holes are dug.
śiro vai yajñasya havirdhānaṃ tadya ime śīrṣaścatvāraḥ kūpā imāvaha dvāvimau dvau tānevaitatkaroti tasmāduparavān khanati //	The cart-shed, truly, is the head of the sacrificer; and what four holes there are here in the head--namely, these two and these two --those he thereby makes: for this reason he digs the sounding-holes.
devāśca vā asurāśca / ubhaye prājāpatyāḥ paspṛdhire tato 'surā eṣu lokeṣu kṛtyāṃ valagānnicakhnurutaivaṃ ciddevānabhibhavemeti //	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending. The Asuras then by way of witchcraft buried charms within these worlds, thinking, 'Peradventure we may thus overcome the gods.'
tadvai devā aspṛṇvata /	The gods then prevailed.

Now, when a charm is dug up, it becomes inoperative and useless. And in like manner, if any malicious enemy buries here charms by way of witchcraft for this (sacrificer), does he thereby dig them up; this is why he digs sounding-holes. He digs just beneath the fore-part of the shafts of the southern cart.

The significance of this formula is the same (as before). That spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed a female: therefore he says 'thou art a woman.'
idamahaṃ rakṣasāṃ grīvā apikṛntāmīti vajro vā abhrirvajreṇaivaitannāṣṭrāṇāṃ rakṣasāṃ grīvā apikṛntati //	He draws their outlines, saving the measure of a span, with, 'Here do I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!' For the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he thus cuts off the necks of the Rakshas.

Or he may also mark them off in one and the same direction : but let him, in any case, mark off last of all the one which is on the left of those in front.

rakṣohaṇaṃ valagahanamiti / rakṣasāṃ hyete valagānām badhāya khāyante vaiṣṇavīmiti vaiṣṇavī hi havirdhāne vāk //	'The Rakshas-killing, charm-killing (voice),' for it is indeed for the killing of the charms of the Rakshas that these (holes) are dug;--'Of Vishnu;' for that voice in the cart-shed is indeed Vishnu's.

Either an alien or an inmate of his house buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.
yam me samāno yamasamāno nicakhāneti samāno vā vā asamāno vā kṛtyāṃ valagānnikhanati tānevaitadutkirati //	'Here do I cast out the charm which my equal, which my unequal has buried for me!' Either one equal, or one unequal, to him buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.

Either a countryman or a foreigner buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out. With 'I cast out witchcraft!' he finallythrows out (the earth remaining in the several holes ), whereby he casts out witchcraft.

He connects them crossways by (underground) channels ; or, if he cannot crossways, he may do so in one and the same direction.
tānyathākhātamevāvamarśayati /	This is why these (openings of the) vital airs are connected by channels farther (inside).

Ever-ruling thou art, a slayer of haters! Man-ruling thou art, a slayer of Rakshas! All-ruling thou art, a slayer of foe-men!' This is the blessing of that work: he thereby invokes a blessing.

The Adhvaryu asks, 'Sacrificer, what is here?'--'Happiness!' he says.--'(Be) that ours in common!' says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.

Now in that they thustouch one another, thereby they make the vital airs yoke-fellows: hence these vital airs meet together farther (inside). And in that, when asked, he replies, 'Happiness (bhadram),' thereby he utters the wish of 'prosperity (kalyânam)' of ordinary speech: that is why, being asked, he replies, 'Happiness.' Thereupon he sprinkles (the holes with water): one and the same forsooth is the significance of sprinkling; he thereby renders them pure.
rakṣohaṇo vo valagahana iti rakṣohaṇo hyete valagahano hyete prokṣāmi vaiṣṇavāniti vaiṣṇavā hyete //	He sprinkles, with the text , 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers;' for they are indeed Rakshas-killers as well as charm-killers; 'Vishnu's own, I sprinkle;' for they indeed belong to Vishnu.
tā avaṭeṣvavanayati tadyā imāḥ prāṇeṣvāpastā evaitaddadhāti tasmādeṣu prāṇeṣvimā āpaḥ //	What remains of the sprinkling-water he then pours out into the pits;--what moisture there is here in the vital airs , that he thereby puts into them: hence that moisture in the vital airs.

Thereupon he spreads barhis-grass, both such as is turned with its tops to the east and such as is turned to the north ; what hair there is here at (the openings of) the vital airs, that he thereby bestows: hence that hair at (the openings of) the vital airs.
rakṣohaṇo vo valagahano 'vastṛṇāmi vaiṣṇavānityatha barhīṃṣi tanūnīvopariṣṭātpracādayati keśā haivāsyaite //	He spreads it with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vishnu's own, I spread.' He, as it were, covers the bodies on the top, for that (grass) is indeed his (Vishnu's) hair .

He surrounds them (with earth) with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vishnu's own, I surround;' he thereby steadies them, makes them immovable.

He lays it down with, 'Thou art Vishnu's own;' for it indeed belongs to Vishnu .

He puts them down with, 'Ye are Vishnu's own;' for they indeed belong to Vishnu. Thus, then, the head of the sacrifice is complete.

And because all the gods sat (sad) in it, therefore it is called sadas: and so do these Brâhmans of every family now sit therein. By way of deity it belongs to Indra.
tanmadhya audumbarīm minoti / annaṃ vā ūrgudumbara udaramevāsya sadastanmadhyato 'nnādyaṃ dadhāti tasmānmadhya audumbarīm minoti // atha ya eṣa madhyamaḥ śaṅkurbhavati /	In the middle of it he puts up a (post) of udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata); for the udumbara means strength and food; now the Sadas being his (Vishnu's belly), he thereby puts food therein; this is why he puts up an udumbara (post) in the middle of it.
vederjaghanārdhe tasmātprāṅ prakrāmati ṣaḍvikramāndakṣiṇā saptamamapakrāmati sampadaḥ kāmāya tadavaṭam parilikhati //	From the peg which stands in the middle on the hind-part of the altar, he strides six steps eastwards (along the 'spine'); the seventh he strides away from it to the right, for the sake of completeness, and there marks off a pit.
devasya tvā savituḥ prasave 'śvinorbāhubhyām pūṣṇo hastābhyāmādade nāryasīti samāna etasya yajuṣo bandhuryoṣo vā eṣā yadabhristasmādāha nāryasīti //	He takes the spade with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, I take thee with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman;' the significance of this formula is the same (as before).
athāvaṭam parilikhati /	That spade, indeed, is a female (feminine): therefore.
idamahaṃ rakṣasāṃ grīvā apikṛntāmīti vajro vā abhrirvajreṇaivaitannāṣṭrāṇāṃ rakṣasāṃ grīvā apikṛntati //	He then marks off the pit with, 'Herewith[paragraph continues] I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!' for the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he cuts off the necks of the evil spirits.
atha khanati /	Thereupon he digs: eastwards he throws up the heap of earth.
prāñcamutkaramutkirati yajamānena sammāyaudumbarīm parivāsayati tāmagreṇa prācīṃ nidadhātyetāvanmātrāṇi barhīṃṣyupariṣṭādadhinidadhāti //	Having made the udumbara (post) of the same size as the sacrificer , he cuts it smooth all round, and lays it down, with the top to the east, in front (of the pit). Thereon he lays barhis-grass of the same length.
atha yavamatyaḥ prokṣaṇyo bhavanti / āpo ha vā oṣadhīnāṃ rasastasmādoṣadhayaḥ kevalyaḥ khāditā na dhinvantyoṣadhaya u hāpāṃ rasastasmādāpaḥ pītāḥ kevalyo na dhinvanti yadaivobhayyaḥ saṃsṛṣṭā bhavantyathaiva dhinvanti tarhi hi sarasā bhavanti sarasābhiḥ prokṣāṇīti //	Now the sprinkling-water (used on this occasion) contains barley-corns. For the essence (sap) of plants is water; wherefore plants when eaten alone do not satiate; and the essence of water, on the other hand, are the plants; wherefore water when drunk alone does not satiate; but only when the two are united they satiate; for then they are sapful: 'with the sapful I will sprinkle,' so he thinks.
devāśca vā asurāśca / ubhaye prājāpatyāḥ paspṛdhire tato devebhyaḥ sarvā evauṣadhaya īyuryavā haivaibhyo neyuḥ //	Now, the gods and the , both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending. Then all the plants went away from the gods, but the barley plants alone went not from them.
tadvai devā aspṛṇvata / ta etaiḥ sarvāḥ sapatnānāmoṣadhīrayuvata yadayuvata tasmādyavā nāma //	The gods then prevailed: by means of these (barley-grains) they attracted to themselves all the plants of their enemies; and because they attracted (yu) therewith, therefore they are called yava (barley).
hanta yaḥ sarvāsāmoṣadhīnāṃ rasastaṃ yaveṣu dadhāmeti sa yaḥsarvāsāmoṣadhīnāṃ rasa āsīttaṃ yaveṣvadadhustasmādyatrānyā oṣadhayo mlāyanti tadete modamānā vardhanta evaṃ hyeṣu rasamadadhustatho evaiṣa etaiḥ sarvāḥ sapatnānāmoṣadhīryute tasmādyavamatyaḥ prokṣaṇyo bhavanti //	They said, 'Come, let us put into the barley whatever sap there is of all plants!' And, accordingly, whatever sap there was of all plants, that they put into the barley: therefore the latter thrives lustily where other plants wither, for in such wisedid they put the sap into them. And in like manner does this one now by means of those (barley-grains) attract to himself all the plants of his enemies: this is why the sprinkling-water contains barley-corns.
yavo 'si yavayāsmaddveṣo yavayārātīriti nātra tirohitamivāstyatha prokṣatyeko vai prokṣaṇasya bandhurmedhyāmevaitatkaroti //	He throws the barley-corns into it, with, 'Thou art barley (yava): keep thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!' In this there is nothing obscure.
sa prokṣati / dive tvāntarikṣāya tvā pṛthivyai tvetīmānevaitallokānūrjā rasena bhājayatyeṣu lokeṣūrjaṃ rasaṃ dadhāti //	He sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts), with, 'For the sky--thee! for the air--thee! for the earth--thee!' He thereby endows these worlds with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.
tā avaṭe 'vanayati śundhantāṃ lokāḥ pitṛṣadanā iti pitṛdevatyo vai kūpaḥ khātastamevaitanmedhyaṃ karoti //	And the sprinkling-water which remains he pours into the hole, with, 'Be the worlds pure wherein the Fathers reside!' for a pit that is dug is sacred to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.
prācīnāgrāṇi codīcīnāgrāṇi cāvastṛṇāti pitṛṣadanamasīti pitṛdevatya vā asyā etadbhavati yannikhātaṃ sā yathānikhātauṣadhiṣu mitā syādevametāsvoṣadhiṣu mitā bhavati //	He now strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and northward-pointed with, 'Thou art the seat of the Fathers;' for that part of it (the post) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the Fathers; as though it were (naturally) established among plants, and not dug in, so does it become established among those plants.
tāmucrayati / uddivaṃ stabhānāntarikṣam pṛṇa dṛṃhasva pṛthivyāmitīmānevaitallokānūrjā rasena bhājayatyeṣu lokeṣūrjaṃ rasaṃ dadhāti //	He raises it, with the text , 'Prop thou the sky! fill the air! stand firm on the earth!' Thereby he endows these worlds with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.
atha minoti / dyutānastvā māruto minotviti yo vā ayam pavata eṣa dyutāno mārutastadenāmetena minoti mitrāvaruṇau dhruveṇa dharmaṇeti prāṇodānau vai mitrāvaruṇau tadenām prāṇodānābhyām minoti //	He then sinks it (in the hole, with), 'May Dyutâna, the son of the Maruts, plant thee!--' Dyutâna the son of the Maruts, doubtless, is he that blows yonder (the wind): by means of him he thus plants it;--'Mitra and Varuna with firm support!' Mitra and Varuna are the in-breathing and out-breathing: he thus plants it with the in-breathing and out-breathing.

Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this one he prays for the priesthood and nobility, those two vital forces .
atha paryṛṣati /	'Winner of growth of wealth,'--growth of wealth means abundance: he thereby prays for abundance.
brahma dṛṃha kṣatraṃ dṛṃhāyurdṛṃha prajāṃ dṛṃhetyāśīrevaiṣaitasya karmaṇa āśiṣamevaitadāśāste samambhūmi paryarṣaṇaṃ karoti gartasya vā uparibhūmyathaivaṃ devatrā tathā hāgartamidbhavati //	He then presses it firmly all round, with, 'Uphold thou the priesthood! uphold the nobility, uphold our life, uphold our progeny!' this is the blessing of this rite: that blessing he thereby invokes. He presses it so as to be level with the ground: with an (ordinary) hole (round trees for watering) it is higher than the ground, but in this way it is with the gods;--and thus it is not planted in an (ordinary) hole.
athāpa upaninayati / yatra vā asyai khanantaḥ krūrīkurvantyapaghnanti śāntirāpastadadbhiḥ śāntyā śamayati tadadbhiḥ saṃdadhāti tasmādapa upaninayati //	He then pours water thereon;--wherever, in digging, they wound or injure this (earth),--water being a means of soothing,--there he soothes it by that means of soothing, water, there he heals it by water: therefore he pours water thereon.
athaivamabhipadya vācayati / dhruvāsi dhruvo 'yaṃ yajamāno 'sminnāyatane prajayā bhūyāditi paśubhiriti vaivaṃ yaṃ kāmaṃ kāmayate so 'smai kāmaḥ samṛdhyate //	He then makes (the sacrificer) say, while touching it thus , 'Thou art firm: may this sacrificer be firm in this homestead through progeny'--or, 'through cattle!' thus whatever wish he entertains that wish is accomplished unto him.
atha sruveṇopahatyājyam / viṣṭapamabhi juhoti ghṛtena dyāvāpṛthivī pūryethāmiti tadime dyāvāpṛthivī ūrjā rasena bhājayatyanayorūrjaṃ rasaṃ dadhāti te rasavatyā upajīvanīye imāḥ prajā upajīvanti // atha cadiradhinidadhāti /	Thereupon, having taken clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, he pours it upon the (forked) top , with 'O Heaven and Earth, be ye full of ghee!' whereby he endows the heaven and the earth with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on them: upon them thus full of sap and affording subsistence, these creatures subsist.

He adds two mats, one on each side thereof, and three north of them and three further (to the north): these make nine. For the sacrificeis threefold and nine also is threefold: for this reason there are nine.
tadudīcīnavaṃśaṃ sado bhavati /	That Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north, and the cart-shed (from west) to east.

But those two, the Âgnîdhra and the Sadas, are common (to the gods and men): hence food and drink is taken in these two, because they are common (to the gods and men). Now the north is the quarter of men: therefore the Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north.

May these favours be favourably received by thee, invigorating the vigorous!' He that delights in songs, forsooth, is Indra, and songs mean the people: he thus surrounds the nobility with the people, and therefore the nobility is here surrounded on both sides by the people.

With, 'Thou art Indra's fixed (point),' he then makes a knot, 'lest it should fall asunder.' He undoes it again, when the work is completed; and thus disease befalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. When completed, hetouches it (the Sadas) with, 'Thou art Indra's own!' for the Sadas belongs to Indra.

One half of it should be inside the altar, and one half outside; or more than one half may be inside the altar and less outside; or the whole of it may be inside the altar. When completed, he touches it with, 'Thou art the All-gods’ own!' To the All-gods it belongs, because on the day before (the Soma feast) the All-gods abide in it by the Vasatîvarî water.

The Asura-Rakshas attacked them from the south and forced them out of the Sadas, and overturned those hearths (dhishnya) of theirs which are within the Sadas.

They forced them (the gods) back to the Âgnîdhra (fire) and even won from them one half of the Âgnîdhra. From there the All-gods gained immortality ,--whence it (the Âgnîdhra fire) is sacred to the All-gods.
tāndevāḥ pratisamaindhata /	Therefore they are kindled at every Soma feast.

Now he who is known and learned in sacred lore is truly accomplished: hence they take to the Agnîdh his Dakshinâ first , since it is from thence (from the Agnîdh's fire) that the gods gained immortality. And if weakness were to come upon one of those that are consecrated, let (the Adhvaryu) say, 'Lead him to the Âgnîdhra!'--thinking 'that is unscathed, there he will not meet with affliction .' And because the All-gods gained immortality from there, therefore it is sacred to the All-gods.
vijāmāno haivāsya dhiṣṇyāḥ /	The Dhishnya-hearths , forsooth, are no otherthan its (the sacrifice's) congeners .
ime samaṅkā ye vai samaṅkāste vijāmāna eta u haivāsyaita ātmanaḥ //	They have the same marks, and those which have the same marks are congeners; and these, then, are those (corresponding limbs) of its trunk.

The gods desired, 'Would that Soma might come to us; we might sacrifice with him, when come.' They produced those two illusions, Suparnî and Kadrû ; Suparnî, forsooth, was Vâk (speech) , and Kadrû was this (earth).

Then said Kadrû 'Its tail was just now hanging down; there, now the wind tosses it, that I see.'

And when Kadrû said, 'Its tail was just now hanging down;there, now the wind tosses it, that I see;' this is nothing else than the rope.
ehīdam patāva vedituṃ yatarā nau jayatīti sā ha kadrūruvāca tvameva pata tvaṃ vai na ākhyāsyasi yatarā nau jayatīti //	Suparnî then said, 'Come, let us now fly thither to know which of us is the winner.' Kadrû said, 'Fly thou thither; thou wilt tell us, which of us is the winner.'

When she had returned, she (Kadrû) said to her, 'Hast thou won, or I?'--'Thou!' she replied. Such is the story called Suparnî-Kâdrava .'

She brought forth the metres; and that Gâyatrî fetched Soma from heaven.
te ha sma kṣurapavī nimeṣaṃ nimeṣamabhisaṃdhatto dīkṣātapasau haiva te āsatustamete gandharvāḥ somarakṣā jugupurime dhiṣṇyā imā hotrāḥ //	He was enclosed between two golden cups ; sharp-edged they closed together at every twinkling of the eye; and these two, forsooth, were Consecration and Penance. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched over him; they are these hearths, these fire-priests.

prajānām prajātyai tasmādaindrāgno 'cāvākaḥ //	Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures, whence the Akhâvâka priest belongs to Indra and Agni.

Let him therefore guard him diligently, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is excluded (from the Soma).

By means of him Suparnî redeemed herself from the gods; wherefore they say, 'He who has sacrificed shares in the world of bliss.'

They then said unto them, 'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering!' And accordingly, when he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots , at the evening libation, that same offering of ghee falls to their share, but not one of Soma.

'And when they will move about, holding the Soma over each , that will satiate you;' hence when they move about, holding the Soma over each (hearth), that satiates them.[paragraph continues] Wherefore let not the Adhvaryu pass between the hearths, for the Adhvaryu carries the Soma, and they sit waiting for him (Soma) with open mouths, and he would enter into their open mouths; and either Agni would burn him, or else that god who rules over beasts (Rudra) would seek after him; hence whenever the Adhvaryu should have business in the hall, let him pass north of the Âgnîdhra shed.

They took each a second name, and therewith prospered, inasmuch as they from whom the Soma-draught had been taken had a share in the sacrifice assigned to them; hence they have two names. Wherefore let a Brahman, if he prosper not, take a second name, for verily he prospers, whosoever, knowing this, takes a second name.

And verily both the gods and men, and the Fathers drink together , and this is their symposium; of old they drank together visibly, but now they do so unseen.

When he sacrifices, he sets free this All.

And that same pervading power Vishnu, the sacrifice, obtains by his strides for this (sacrificer) when he sacrifices: this is why he performs the Vaisargina offerings.

He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the old Gârhapatya), and cleans the spoons. The sacrificer takes the king (Soma) on his lap. He (the Adhvaryu) scatters about the (dust of the) foot-print of the Soma-cow behind the (new) Gârhapatya for the sake of a firm standing, for it is with the foot that one stands firmly.

For he (Soma) spake upon that time, 'Verily I am afraid of the Rakshas: do ye make me to be too small for their deadly shaft, so that the evil spirits (the Rakshas) shall not injure me on the way; and take me across in the form of a drop, for the drop is nimble.' And accordingly, having made him too small for the deadly shaft, they lead him safely across in the form of a drop, from fear of the Rakshas, for the drop is nimble: this is why he offers the second oblation to (Soma) the Nimble.

Further, the two spits for (roasting) the omenta , the two ropes (for binding the stake and victims), the two churning-sticks (for producing fire), the adhimanthana chip, and the two vrishana ,--having taken up all these they go forward (to the Âgnîdhra): thus the sacrifice goes upwards .

He thereby places Agni in front, and Agni marches in front repelling the evil spirits; and they take him thither on a (way) free from danger andinjury.

May he gain riches in the winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies, Hail!' By means of him (Agni) he thus takes a firm stand in that resting-place, the aerial region, and gains that world.

The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water, and sprinkles first the fire-wood, and then the altar. They then hand to him the altar-grass. He puts it down with the knot towards the east, and sprinkles it. Having poured (the remaining sprinkling-water) upon (the root ends of the altar-grass), and untied the knot,--the Prastara-hunch of asvavâla grass is tied together (with the altar-grass),--he takes that; and having taken the Prastara, he spreads the altar-grass in a single layer.

Thereby he takes a firm stand in that resting-place, the sky: he thus gains that world by offering with that (verse).

And having attained to safety, he now makes him the one he really is, namely, the sacrifice, for Vishnu is the sacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vishnu.

The reason why he makes the king enter, after depositing the spoons and touching water, is this. The ghee is the thunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence it is after depositing the spoons and touching water that he makes the king enter, lest he should injure the seed Soma with the thunderbolt, the ghee.

Now Agni and Soma have seized him who consecrates himself between their jaws , for that consecration-offering belongs to Agni and Vishnu, and Vishnu forsooth is no other than Soma; and he himself that consecrates himself is the food of the gods: thus they have seized him between their jaws, and he now expressly redeems himself from Soma, when he says, 'Now, O divine Soma, hast thou, a god, joined the gods, and here (have I joined) the men with increase of wealth;'--increase of wealth means abundance: 'with abundance' he thereby means to say.

Our vows, O lord of vows, (have been performed) rightly: the lord of consecration hathapproved my consecration; the lord of penance hath approved my penance.' Thereby he frees himself visibly from Agni, and sacrifices with a self (body) now his own: hence they now partake of his food, for he is a man (again); hence they now use his (real) name, for he is a man. And as to their not eating (of his food) heretofore, it is as one would not eat of sacrificial food, before offering has been made thereof: therefore let no one partake of the food of one consecrated.

And again, why he offers with a verse addressed to Vishnu--Vishnu being the sacrifice, he thus approaches the stake by means of the sacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vishnu.

'Thee have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the farther side of the nearer;' he does indeed fell it on the nearer side of the farther, of those that are farther away from it; and 'on the farther side of the nearer,' he says, because he does fell it on the farther side of the nearer, of those that are on this side of it.

As for the good work, he would favour (select) one from amidst many (men) and he (the chosen) would be well-disposed to that work, even so does he now, for the good work, favour that (tree) from amidst many, and it becomes well-disposed to the felling.

He then strikes with the axe, with, 'O axe, hurt it not!' for the axe is a thunderbolt, but thus that thunderbolt, the axe, does not hurt it.

But let him take care to keep it from (falling towards) the southern quarter, for that is the quarter of the Fathers: therefore he must take care to keep it from the southern quarter.

In the words 'hurt not the air' there is nothing obscure. By 'Unite with the earth,' he means to say, 'Be thou in harmony with the earth!' 'For this sharp-edged axe hath led thee forward unto great bliss,' for this sharp axe indeed leads it forward.

And ghee being seed, he thus endows the trees with that seed; and from that seed (in) the stump trees are afterwards produced .

The significance of that formula is the same (as before); and that spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed female: therefore he says 'thou art a woman.'
idamahaṃ rakṣasāṃ grīvā apikṛntāmīti vajro vā abhrirvajreṇaivaitannāṣṭrāṇāṃ rakṣasāṃ grīvā apikṛntati //	He thus draws the outline of the hole (for the stake ), with, 'Herewith I cut off the necks ofthe Rakshas!' The spade is the thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus cuts off the necks of the Rakshas.
atha khanati /	He then digs, and throws up a heap of earth towards the east.

In front of it he lays down the stake with the top towards the east. Thereon he puts sacrificial grass of the same size, and thereupon he puts the chip of the stake. In front on the (north) side (of the stake) he puts down the head-piece . The sprinkling-water has barley-corns mixed with it: the significance of this is the same (as before ).
yavo 'si yavayāsmaddveṣo yavayārātīriti nātra tirohitamivāstyatha prokṣatyeko vai prokṣaṇasya bandhurmedhyamevaitatkaroti //	He throws the barley-corns in with, 'Thou art barley (yava), keep thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!' There is nothing obscure in this.

tā avaṭe 'vanayati śundhantāṃ lokāḥ pitṛṣadanā iti pitṛdevatyo vai kūpaḥ khātastamevaitanmedhyaṃ karoti //	The sprinkling-water that remains he then pours into the hole with, 'Be the worlds purewherein the Fathers reside!' for a pit that is dug is sacred to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.

atha yūpaśakalam prāsyati /	He then throws in the (first) chip of the stake.

Hence, when he throws in the chip of the stake, he does so thinking, 'I will plant it (the stake) full of vigour.' The reason why it is this (chip) and no other, is that this one has been produced with a formula, is sacrificially pure: therefore he throws in the chip of the stake.

'Be thou mindful of this: it will stand upon thee!' for it (the stake) will indeed stand on it, wherefore he says, 'Be thou mindful of this: it will stand upon thee.'

Having then gone round to the front, he sits down facing the north and anoints the stake.

And as to its being, as it were, contracted in the middle, the berry here on trees is fastened (to the stalk) sideways; what connecting part there is between (the fruit and stalk) pressed in, as it were, that he thereby makes it.
āntamagniṣṭhāmanakti /	This is why it is, as it were, contracted in the middle.

sa ucriyati /	He thengrasps the girding-part all round, and says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the (stake) being set up!'

With this trishtubh verse he plants it; the trishtubh is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt; therefore he plants it with a trishtubh verse.

Hence were he to turn the fire-corner aside from the fire, the sacrificer would assuredly turn aside from the sacrifice; therefore he places the (corner which was) facing the fire opposite the fire.
athaivamabhipadya vācayati /	He then heaps up (earth) round it and presses it firmly all round, and pours water thereon .

For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the thunderbolt: 'See ye Vishnu's conquest!' he means to say when he says, 'See ye the deeds of Vishnu, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra's allied friend.' Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice, and the sacrificial stake belongs to Vishnu; he thereby connects it with Indra; therefore he says, 'Indra's allied friend.'

For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the thunderbolt: 'See ye that conquest of Vishnu!' he means to say when he says, 'The wise ever behold that highest step of Vishnu, fixed like an eye in the heaven.'
atha parivyayati /	He then girds (the stake with a rope of kusa-grass).

He thereby puts food into him, for it is there that the food settles; therefore he girds it at that place.
trivṛtā parivyayati / trivṛddhyannam paśavo hyannam pitā mātā yajjāyate tattṛtīyaṃ tasmāttrivṛtā parivyayati //	He girds it with a triple (rope), for threefold is food, and food means cattle; and (there is) the father and the mother, and what is born is the third; therefore he girds it with a triple (rope).
sa parivyayati / parivīrasi pari tvā daivīrviśo vyayantām parīmaṃ yajamānaṃ rāyo manuṣyāṇāmiti tadyajamānāyāśiṣamāśāste yadāha parīmaṃ yajamānaṃ rāyo manuṣyāṇāmiti //	He girds it with , 'Thou art enfolded; may the heavenly hosts enfoldthee! may riches enfold this sacrificer among men!' He invokes a blessing on the sacrificer, when he says, 'May riches enfold this sacrificer among men.'

For it is doubtless the offspring of that (sacrificial stake); hence if there be the full number of eleven stakes , let him insert in each its own (chip) without confounding them; and his offspring is born orderly and not foolish. But whosoever inserts them in confusion, not its own in each, verily his offspring is born disorderly and foolish; therefore let him insert its own in each without confounding them.

atha yasmātsvarurnāma / etasmādvā eṣo 'pacidyate tasyaitatsvamevārurbhavati tasmātsvarurnāma // tasya yannikhātam /	And as to why it is called svaru ('very sore'),--that (chip) is cut off from that (stake), and thus is its own (sva) sore (arus); therefore it is called 'svaru.'

But in hurling the club one takes hold of its fore-part; and that (stake) is the fore-part of the sacrifice; therefore he sets it up on the fore-part (of the altar).
yajñena vai devāḥ /	Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield.

They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey, and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial stake, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (sacrificial stake). At the head stands intelligence, at the head swiftness of thought; therefore he sets it up on the fore-part (of the altar).
aṣṭākṣarā vai gāyatrī pūrvārdho vai yajñasya gāyatrī pūrvārdhe eṣa yajñasya tasmādaṣṭāśrirbhavati //	It is eight-cornered; for the gâyatrî metre consists of eight syllables, and the gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake) is the forepart of the sacrifice; therefore it is eight-cornered.
taṃ ha smaitaṃ devā anupraharanti / yathedamapyetarhyeke 'nupraharantīti devā akurvanniti tato rakṣāṃsi yajñamanūdapibanta //	Now the gods once threw it after (the prastara into the fire) even as now some throw it after, thinking, 'So the gods did it.' Thereupon the Rakshas sipped the sacrifice (Soma) after (the gods).

yūpaśakalamevājuhottadahaiṣa svagākṛta āsīttatho rakṣāṃsi yajñaṃ nānūdapibantāyaṃ vai vajra udyata iti //	The Adhvaryu, then, offered up only a chip of the stake, and thereby that (sacrificer) was bid good-speed; and thus the Rakshas did not thereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, 'that surely is a raised thunderbolt.'

He offers it with the text , 'May thy smoke rise up to the sky, thy light to the heavens! fill the earth with ashes, Hail!'
yāvato vai vedistāvatī pṛthivī /	Verily, as large as the altar is, so large is the earth.

Hence there are eleven stakes, and the twelfth lies aside rough-hewn; he puts it down south (of the altar). The reason why the twelfth lies aside is this.
devā ha vai yajñaṃ tanvānāḥ /	Now the gods, while performing this sacrifice,were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas.

But that twelfth (stake) lying aside,--even as an arrow drawn but not discharged, as (a weapon) raised but not hurled, so was that a thunderbolt raised for repelling the evil spirits on the south; therefore the twelfth (stake) lies aside.

There are the animal (victim) and the sacrificial stake; to this one he thereby assigns of animals that of the forest, and thus it, too, is possessed of an animal (victim). That setting up of the eleven sacrificial stakes is said to be of two kinds,--some, namely, set (them all) up (on the previous day) for the morrow's Soma feast, and others set up (one) stake for the preparation of the morrow's Soma feast.
tadu tathā na kuryāt /	Let him, however, not do this; but let him only set up the one opposite the fire.

Thus there would be an offence, since it is for the victim that the stake is set up, and the victim is (only) slaughtered on the next morning: let him therefore set up (the others) on the next morning. Let him first set up that (stake) which stands (immediately) north of the one opposite the fire, then the one on the south, then a northern one,--last of all the one on the southern flank: thus it (the row of stakes) inclines to the north.

It (the victim to Tvashtri) is an animal with testicles, for such a one is a begetter. Let him not slay that one, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it. Were he to slay it, there would assuredly be an end to offspring, but in this way he sets free the offspring. Therefore let him notslay it, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it.

And as to why this is so:--well, animals did not at first submit thereto that they should become food, as they are now become food; for just as man here walks two-footed and erect, so did they walk two-footed and erect.

And as to why this is so:--well, animals did not at first submit thereto that they should become sacrificial food, as they are now become sacrificial food and are offered up in the fire.

It (the animal) knows that this truly is the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered; and accordingly it resigns itself and becomes favourably disposed to the slaughtering. Therefore having driven up the victim and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake).

Let him, however, not do this; for it would be as if he intended to commit secretly some lawless action.

'The celestial hosts have approached the gods;'the celestial hosts, forsooth, are those beasts: 'they have submitted to the gods' he means to say, when he says, 'The celestial hosts have approached the gods.'

'O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!' The Lord of prayer, forsooth, is the Brahman; and goods mean cattle: those, which did not submit, the gods on that occasion enclosed with the Brahman on the farther side, and they did not pass over it. And in like manner does he now enclose them with the Brahman on the farther side, and they do not pass over it: therefore he says, 'O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!' Having made a noose he throws it over (the victim) .

Even as on that occasion , when taking out an oblation for a deity, he assigns it, so does he now assign it to the two deities. He then sprinkles it,--one and the same, forsooth, is thesignificance of sprinkling: he thereby makes it sacrificially pure.

For when it rains, then plants are produced here on earth; and by eating plants and drinking water that sap originates, and from sap seed, and from seed beasts: hence whereby it exists, wherefrom it springs, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure.

'I sprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni and Soma;' he thus makes it pure for those two deities for whom he slays it.

'Thy limbs with those worthy of offering' he says, because it is with its limbs that they sacrifice: 'Obtain thou that they may sacrifice with thy limbs' is what he thereby means to say. 'The lord of sacrifice with his prayer,' hereby they invoke a blessing on the sacrificer: 'Obtain thou that through thee they may invoke a blessing on the sacrificer' is what he thereby means to say.

But it is the sacrificer whomhe chooses, saying, 'Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts,' for Agni is the head of the deities; wherefore he says, 'Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts;'--'this sacrificer of the human;' for that community wherein he sacrifices is behind (inferior to) him; wherefore he says, 'This sacrificer (is the head) of the human.' 'May the household of these two shine brightly, not (like a cart yoked) with one bullock, for a hundred winters,--two yoke-fellows!' whereby he means to say, 'May their household matters be free from calamities for a hundred years .'

Now when this one sacrifices in the fire, he gives gifts to Agni; and whatever blessing the priests here invoke upon the sacrificer, all that Agni accomplishes. Thus they unite only their blessings, but not also their bodies: wherefore he says, 'Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies.'

With his whole mind, with his whole self, forsooth, he who consecrates himself prepares and endeavours to prepare the sacrifice. His self is, as it were, emptied out; with those Âprîs they fill it again; and because they fill it therewith, therefore they are called Âprî.

He carries it round the place where they cook it (the victim ).

For this (firebrand), surely, is âhavanîya (fit to offer upon); it is not for the purpose that they should cook uncooked (food) thereon, but for this that they should sacrifice cooked (food) thereon.'

The Pratiprasthâtri holds on to it from behind by means of the two spits , and the Adhvaryu (holds on to) the Pratiprasthâtri, and the Sacrificer to the Adhvaryu.

But let him nevertheless hold on to it; for that (victim) which they lead to the sacrifice they lead not to death; therefore let him hold on to it. Moreover he would cut himself off from the sacrifice, were he not to hold on to it; therefore let him hold on to it. It is held on to in a mysterious way; by means of the spits the Pratiprasthâtri (holds on to it); to the Pratiprasthâtri the Adhvaryu, to the Adhvaryu the Sacrificer; thus then it is held on to in a mysterious way.

This is what belongs to the All-gods at the animal offering.

Approach thou,'--thereby he means to say, 'Approach thou an existence free from affliction,'--'from the wide air, along with the divine wind;' for the Rakshas moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man here moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides: he means to say, 'Meeting together with the wind, protect thou this one from the wide air,' when he says 'from the wide air, along with the divine wind.'

They do not slay it on the frontal bone , for that is humanmanner; nor behind the ear, for that is after the manner of the Fathers. They either choke it by merely keeping its mouth closed, or they make a noose. Therefore he says not, 'Slay! kill!' for that is human manner, but, 'Quiet it! It has passed away!' for that is after the manner of the gods.

When they hold it down, then, before the strangling, he offers with 'Hail, to the gods!' And when (the butcher) says, 'Quieted is the victim,' he offers with, 'To the gods, Hail!' Thus some of the gods are preceded by 'Hail,' and others followed by 'Hail;' he thereby gratifies them, and thus gratified both kinds of gods convey him to the heavenly world. These are the so-called 'paripasavya ' oblations; he may offer them if he choose; or, if he choose, he need not mind them.

But that wife, forsooth, is the hind-part of the sacrifice, and he wants her, thus coming forward, to propitiate the sacrifice. Thereby, then, she makes amends to that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure her: therefore she says, 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched!'

Now the vital airs are water; hence she now puts into it those vital airs, and thus that food of the gods becomes truly living, becomes immortal for the immortals.

Thus they put the vital airs into it and revive it: 'Whatever is sore, whatever hurt in thee, may that fill up and become firm.'

With 'Auspicious be the days!' they pour out (the remaining water) behind the victim.

He then applies the edge of the knife to it (and cuts through it) with, 'Injure it not, O blade!' for the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the knife, does not injure it.

Thus it is by means of the sacrifice that he drives away the evil spirits, the Rakshas. And as to its being rootless and severed on both sides,--rootless, forsooth, and severed on both sides, the Rakshas moves about in the air, even as man here moves about in the air rootless and severed on both sides: therefore it (the grass-end) is rootless and severed on both sides.

With thatsame sacrificial essence he now perfects it, and makes it whole; therefore the two omentum-spits are of kârshmarya wood.

They go behind the pit (kâtvâla) and proceed to the Âhavanîya. The Adhvaryu throws that (top part of the) grass-stalk into the Âhavanîya with, 'O Vâyu, graciously accept the drops!' for this is the kindler (samidh) of the drops .

Hereby then he propitiates it, and thus that fire does not injure him while passing by; this is why he heats the omentum while standing on the north side.

And why they do not take it there outside (the altar) along the front of the sacrificial stake, is that they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice; therefore they take it alongbetween the sacrificial stake and the fire.

Thus those drops thereof reach the fire after becoming cooked offerings, made with Svâhâ (hail)!

When it is roasted,--

The Adhvaryu, having taken the two spoons and stept across (to the north side of the fire) and called for the Sraushat, says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt for the Svâhâs !' and offers (the ghee) when the Vashat has been pronounced .

Let him not heed that (objection of the Karakas); for this is the last fore-offering,--and this being a havis-offering, at the last fore-offering he first pours ghee into the dhruvâ, being about to offer the first two butter-portions with it . Now, on the present occasion, he will first offer the omentum; therefore let him first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee. And though he does not baste the victim with ghee, 'lest he should baste the uncooked,' that whole victim of his yet becomes (as it were) basted with ghee in that he bastes the omentum; let him therefore first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee.

Then, cutting off the omentum (from the spits and putting it into the spoon), he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Somafor the omentum and fat of the buck!' He then lays (another) piece of gold on (the omentum) and bastes it twice with ghee above.

And so it rises from hence, and so it lives; for this reason there is a piece of gold on both sides. Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering-prayer on) the omentum and fat of the buck for Agni and Soma!' He does not say, '. .

(the omentum and fat) brought forward;' when the Soma has been pressed he says, 'brought forward .' He offers when the Vashat has been pronounced. Having offered the omentum, he lays the two spits together and throws them after (the omentum into the fire), with, 'Consecrated by Svâhâ, go ye to Ûrdhvanabhas , son of the Maruts!' He does so, thinking, 'Lest these two wherewith we have cooked the omentum should come to nought.'

The reason why he subsequently prepares a cake is this. Rice and barley, truly, are the sacrificial essence of all animals (victims) ; with that same essence he now completes that (victim) and makes it whole.
atha yadvapayā pracarya /	This is why he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake.

It is from the middle (of the victim) that this omentum is pulled out, and from the middle he now completes that (victim) by means of that sacrificial essence and makes it whole; therefore he proceeds with that cake after performing with the omentum.
triḥ pracyāvayatāttriḥpracyutasya hṛdayamuttamaṃ kurutāditi trivṛddhi yajñaḥ //	Thereupon he cuts up the victim: 'Move thrice , and make the heart the uppermost of the thrice-moved!' thus (he says to the slaughterer), for threefold is the sacrifice.

atha juhvā pṛṣadājyasyopahatya / adhvaryurupaniṣkramya pṛcati śṛtaṃ haviḥ śamitāriti śṛtamityāha taddevānāmityupāṃśvadhvaryuḥ //	Having then taken clotted ghee with the guhû, the Adhvaryu, stepping up (from the altar) to (the Sâmitra), asks, 'Is the sacrificial food cooked, O Sâmitar?' 'Cooked,' he says. 'That is of the gods,' says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.
tadyatpṛcati /	The reason why he asks is this.
śṛtaṃ vai devānāṃ havirnāśṛtaṃ śamitā vai tadveda yadi śṛtaṃ vā bhavatyaśṛtaṃ vā //	Cooked, forsooth, not uncooked (must be) the gods' food; and the Samitri indeed knows whether it is cooked or uncooked.

Thrice he asks, for threefold is the sacrifice. And as to his saying, 'That is of the gods,' that which is cooked, indeed, belongs to the gods; therefore he says, 'That is of the gods.'
ātmā vai mano hṛdayam prāṇaḥ pṛṣadājyamātmanyevaitanmanasi prāṇaṃ dadhāti tathaitajjīvameva devānāṃ havirbhavatyamṛtamamṛtānām //	The heart he bastes (with clotted ghee) first of all; for the heart is the self (soul), the mind; and the clotted ghee is the breath; he thus puts the breath into its (the victim's) self, into its mind; and thus it verily becomes the living food of the gods, and immortal for the immortals.
so 'bhighārayati / saṃ te mano manasā sam prāṇaḥ prāṇena gacatāmiti na svāhākaroti na hyeṣāhutirudvāsayanti paśum //	He bastes it with , 'May thy mind unite with the mind; thy breath with the breath!' He utters no Svâhâ ('hail'), for this is not an oblation. They remove the victim (from the cooking-fire) .

And why they do not take it outside (the altar) in front of the stake, is that they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice: therefore they take (the flesh) along between the stake and the fire. When they have put it down south (of the fire), the Pratiprasthâtri cuts off (the portions). There are Plaksha branches (Ficus Infectoria) by way of an upper barhis (covering of altar); thereon he cuts.

For when the gods, at first, seized an animal to sacrifice), Tvashtri first spat upon its head, thinking, 'Surely, thus they will not touch it!' for animals belong to Tvashtri. That (spittle became) the brain in the head and the marrow in the neck-bone : hence that (substance) is like spittle, for Tvashtri spat it. Let him therefore not eat that, since it was spitten by Tvashtri.

With that same sacrificial essence he now completes it (the victim), and makes it whole: hence there are Plaksha branches as an upper covering.

All the deities draw nigh to the victim while it is immolated, thinking, 'My name he will choose, my name he will choose!' for the animal victim is sacrificial food for all deities. The minds (manas), then, of all those deities are, fixed upon (ota) that victim; those (minds of theirs) he thereby satisfies, and thus the minds of the gods have not drawn nigh in vain. For this reason he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity.

And, accordingly, if any portion were omitted, he need not heed this, since it is of his entire animal victim that the first portion is made which is made of the heart. He therefore first makes a portion of the heart, that being in the middle.

Thereupon he bastes it twice with ghee above. He then mixes it either with the crooked knife or with the chopping-knife , with '--Confounded hatred !' whereby he chases away from here those evil spirits, the Rakshas.

He then bastes it twice with ghee above.
tadyaddhiraṇyaśakalāvabhito bhavataḥ /	The reason why there is a piece of gold on each side is this.

But were he to cut straight on, this animal would draw forward its feet (of the same side) simultaneously: therefore he cuts crossways. Then as to why he does not make cuttings of the head, nor the shoulders, nor the neck, nor the hind-thighs.

The Earth then said unto them, 'Heed ye not this: I will myself be an eye-witness thereof, in whatsoever manner they will perform this (offering).'

The Asuras then made portions of the head, the shoulders, the neck, and the hind-thighs: therefore let him not make portions of these. And since Tvashtri spat upon the neck, therefore let him not make a portion of the neck. Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma for the havis of the buck!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering-prayer for) the havis of the buck to Agni and Soma!' He does not say '(the havis) made ready:' when the Soma has been pressed he says 'made ready.'
antareṇārdharcau yājyāyai vasāhomaṃ juhoti /	In the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer he offers the oblation of gravy.

Now between the sky and the earth is the air, and it is to the air that he offers: therefore he offers the oblation of gravy between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer.

Drink the gravy, ye drinkers of gravy! thou art the havis of the air, Hail!' With this prayer to the All-gods he offers, for the air belongs to the All-gods: because creatures move about here in the air breathing in and breathing out therewith, therefore it belongs to the All-gods. As the Vashat (of the offering-prayer for the meat portions) is pronounced, he offers the portions that are in the guhû.

And as to his offering (to the tree) between the two oblations, he thus fills both completely: therefore he offers between the two oblations.
tāni samānayamāna āhāgnaye sviṣṭakṛte 'nubrūhītyāśrāvyāhāgnaye sviṣṭakṛte preṣyeti vaṣaṭkṛte juhoti //	Thereupon, while pouring together the meat portions that are for the upabhrit, he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni Svishtakrit (the maker of good offering)!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt for Agni Svishtakrit!' and offers as the Vashat is pronounced.

For the offering of gravy is sap: thus he imbues all the regions with sap, and hence sap is obtained here on earth in every region.

etarhi sammarśanasya kālo 'tha yatpurā samṛśati ya ima upatiṣṭhante te vimathiṣyanta iti śaṅkamāno yadyu vimāthānna śaṅketātraiva sammṛśet //	And whether he has touched it before, fearing 'those (evil spirits) that hover near will tear it about,' or whether he be not afraid of its being torn about, let him in any case now touch (the victim).

To Indra belongeth the in-breathing: it is attended to in every limb.' Where it has been cut up limb by limb, there he heals it by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing.--'O divine Tvashtri, let thine ample (forms) closely unite together, that it be uniform what is of different shape:' whereby he makes it completely enclosed (in its limbs and flesh). 'May thy friends, thy father and mother , to please thee, joyfully welcome thee going to the gods!' Thus, having made it whole wherever he has offered (a piece of) it, he afterwards unites it firmly, and that body (self) of it is complete in yonder world.

tadāhuḥ / kiṃ tadyajñe kriyate yena prāṇaḥ sarvebhyo 'ṅgebhyaḥ śiva iti //	Now they say,' What, then, is done at the sacrifice whereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs?'

And if it be lean, let him stuff into the hind-part whatever may be left of the fat of the belly: the hind-part being (an opening of) the vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through. The animal, forsooth, is breath; for only so long (does) the animal (live), as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.
medo vai medhastadenam medhamupanayati yadyu aṃsalo bhavati svayamupeta eva tarhi medham bhavati // atha pṛṣadājyaṃ gṛhṇāti /	The hind-part is (part of) the animal, and fat means sacrificial essence : thus he supplies it with the sacrificial essence. But if it be tender (juicy), then it has itself obtained the sacrificial essence.
dvayaṃ vā idaṃ sarpiścaiva dadhi ca dvandvaṃ vai mithunam prajananam mithunamevaitatprajananaṃ kriyate //	Thereupon he takes clotted ghee; for twofold indeed is this (clotted ghee),--to wit, both gheeand sour milk ,--and a productive union means a couple: thus a productive union is thereby effected.

tadvā etadeko dvābhyāṃ vaṣaṭkaroti /	Here now, one (Hotri) pronounces the Vashat for two,--for the Adhvaryu (who performs the after-offerings)and for him (the Pratiprasthâtri) who performs the by-offerings.

And in performing the by-offerings, he produces (offspring) , since he performs the by-offerings behind (the altar), and from behind offspring is produced from woman.

devaṃ savitāraṃ gaca svāheti savitā vai devānām prasavitā savitṛprasūta evaitatprajanayati //	'Go thou to the divine Savitri, Hail!' Savitri is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savitri he thus produces creatures.
mitrāvaruṇau gaca svāheti / prāṇodānau vai mitrāvaruṇau prāṇodānāvevaitatprajāsu dadhāti //	'Go thou to Mitra and Varuna, Hail!' Mitra and Varuna are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on the creatures.
ahorātre vā anu prajāḥ prajāyante 'horātre evaitadanu prajanayati // candāṃsi gaca svāheti /	'Go thou to the day and the night, Hail! It is through (along) day and night that offspring is born: through day and night he causes creatures to be born.

For, Pragâpati, having created the living beings,enclosed them between heaven and earth, and so these beings are enclosed between heaven and earth. And in like manner does this (offerer), having created living beings, enclose them between heaven and earth.
athātyupayajati /	He then makes additional by-offerings (atiupayag).

so 'tyupayajati / yajñaṃ gaca svāhetyāpo vai yajña āpo reto reta evaitatsiñcati //	He makes the additional by-offerings:--with 'Go thou to the sacrifice , Hail!' The sacrifice is water, and seed is water: he thus casts seed.

Agni Vaisvânara ('belonging to all men') is this earth, and she is a safe resting-place: upon that safe resting-place he thus produces (creatures).
atha mukhaṃ vimṛṣṭe / mano me hārdi yaceti tatho hopayaṣṭātmānaṃ nānupravṛṇakti //	He then touches his mouth, with, 'Give me mind and heart!' thus indeed the by-offerer does not throw himself after (the oblations into the fire).

antarato devānām patnībhyo 'vadyati / antarato vai yoṣāyai prajāḥ prajāyanta upariṣṭādagnaye gṛhapataya upariṣṭādvai vṛṣā yoṣām adhidravati //	For the wives of the gods he cuts portions from the inside, since it is from the inside of woman that offspring is produced; for Agni the householder from above, since it is from above that the male approaches the female.

Uppermost on the thrice-moved (portions of the) victim he places that heart after pulling it off (the spit).
atha hṛdayaśūlam prayacati /	He (the slaughterer) then hands the heart-spit (to the Adhvaryu).

But if he feel disinclined to going down (to the water), he pours out a vessel of water in front of the sacrificial stake and buries (the spit) at the place where the dry and the moist meet, with , 'Injure thou not the waters nor the plants!' thus it injures neither the waters nor the plants; 'From every fetter --therefrom deliver us, O king Varuna! That they say, we swear by the ""Inviolable (cows),"" by ""Varuna ,""therefrom deliver us, O Varuna!' Thereby he delivers him from every noose of Varuna, from all (guilt) against Varuna."

For when they proceed with that (spit), the waters, forsooth, as well as the plants, keep as it were receding from him; but hereby he now makes a covenant with them, and so they again approach to him, and that expiation is performed (to them). He does not perform (the spit-bath) at the animal offering to Agni and Soma, nor at that to Agni, but only at that of the Anûbandhyâ-cow , for therewith the whole sacrifice attains to completion. And in that they perform (the ceremony) with the heart-spit at the cow (offering), thereby indeed it comes to be performed also for the animal offering to Agni and Soma, as well as for that to Agni.

And so does this one now become strong by speech, and speech turns unto him, and he makes speech subject to himself.

And so does this one now become strong by means of cattle; the cattle turn unto him, and he makes the cattle subject to himself.

And so does this one now become strong by means of the Brahman; the priesthood turns unto him, he makes the priesthood subject to himself.

And so does this one now become strong by everything; everything turns to him, and he makes everything subject to himself.

And so does this one now become strong by means of power and vigour; power and vigour turn to him, and he makes power and vigour subject to himself.
kṣatraṃ vā indro viśo viśve devā annādyamevāsmā etatpurastātkaroti //	And as to why it comes after that for the All-gods,--Indra is the nobility, and the All-gods are the clans (people); he thus places the food before him.

And so does this one now become strong by both these energies; both energies turn unto him, and he makes both energies subject to himself.

For it is for him that burns yonder (the sun) that he takes it, since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his rays of light: therefore let him take it by day. For it is by day alone that he (shines): therefore, then, let him take it by day.

They draw nigh to that sacrificial food, and abide (upa-vas) in that Vasatîvarî water,--that is the Upavasatha (preparation-day).

If he have performed a (Soma-)sacrifice before this, let him (the Adhvaryu) take it from his tank , sincethat (water) of his has been taken before (sunset) by day. But should he not have offered before, if there be one who has offered (Soma) settled close by or somewhere thereabout , let him take it from his tank, since that (water) of his has been taken before, by day.

adhvaro vai yajñastadyasmai yajñāya gṛhṇāti taṃ haviṣmantaṃ karoti tasmādāha haviṣmāndevo adhvara iti //	'Rich in havis (may be) the divine cult;' cult, namely, means the sacrifice; thus he makes the sacrifice for which he takes it rich in sacrificial food, therefore he says, 'Rich in havis is the divine cult.'

And when the animal offering to Agni and Soma comes to a close, then he carries (the Vasatîvarî water) round. He says (thrice), 'Disperse!' The sacrificer is seated in front of the Soma-carts (holding Soma on his lap ).

He takes it up again and puts it down in front of the lady (who, seated behind the Gârhapatya, touches the water-jar).

Let him not put it down in this way that is redundant, and no fitting conclusion is thus attained. Let him rather (here also) say, 'Ye are Indra and Agni's share!' only thus there is nothing redundant, and so a fitting conclusion is obtained.

He puts itdown in the Âgnîdhra (fire-house) with, 'Ye are all the gods' share!' whereby he makes all the gods enter it. It is a desirable object (vara) to the dwellers (vasat), hence the name Vasatîvarî , and verily he who knows this, becomes a desirable object to the dwellers.

For when the metres were produced from Vâk (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the Sakvarî, was the last (highest) of them;--that completeness (he brings about): hence there are seven formulas.

Having taken the portions of ghee, they betake themselves (to the high altar).

He puts him on the pressing stones lying there with their heads (mukha, mouths) towards each other; for Soma is the nobility, and the stones are the clans (people); he thereby raises the nobility over the clan. And as to why they are lying with their heads together,--he thereby makes the clan of one head (or mouth) with, and uncontentious towards, the nobles; therefore they are lying with their heads towards each other.

This he says for the (accomplishment of the) sacrificer's wish, since it is with the heart and mind that the sacrificer entertains the wish for which he sacrifices; therefore he says, 'Thee for the heart, thee for the mind!'
dive tvā sūryāya tveti /	'Thee for the sky, thee for the sun!' This, on the other hand, he says with a view to the world of the gods.

'Upwards convey thou to the sky, to the gods, this cult, these invocations!' Cult, doubtless, means sacrifice: he thereby means to say, 'Upwards carry thou this sacrifice to the sky, to the gods!' [Vâg. S.
soma rājanviśvāstvam prajā upāvaroheti / tadenamāsām prajānāmādhipatyāya rājyāyopāvaharati //	], 'O Soma, king, descend unto all thy people!' whereby he brings him down for the lordship, for the sovereignty of these people (creatures).

Now, in saying, 'Descend unto all thy people,' he does what is unseemly, for Soma being the nobility, he thereby, as it were, confounds good and bad ,--and, indeed, in consequence thereof, people now confound good and bad. But in this (formula) he does what is right and according to order,--in saying, 'May all thy people descend to thee,' he makes all his subjects go down (on their knees) before him; and hence when a noble approaches, all these subjects, the people, go down before him, crouch down by him on the ground .

Now the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres; and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite) to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!'

But let him not say so; for the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres, and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt--to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!' therefore let him say, 'Recite to the gods, the early-coming!'

Hereby he now again strengthens the metres and makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; and by means of them, thus unimpaired in vigour, theyperform the sacrifice; this is why the Hotri recites the morning-prayer.

The Adhvaryu should wait through (the prayer) waking, and when he blinks, this is his response. But let him not do this; if he fall asleep (again) he may as well sleep. When the Hotri brings his morning-prayer to a close ,--there is an offering-spoon called Prakaranî,--having therein taken ghee in four ladlings, he (the Adhvaryu) offers it.

'May the divine Savitri hear my prayer, Hail!' whereby he means to say, 'May the divine Savitri hear this (prayer) of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;' for Savitri is the impeller of the gods; impelled by him he goes for that sap of the sacrifice.

The reason why the Hotri then recites is this: by that[paragraph continues] (oblation) he (the Adhvaryu) pours out (the ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice (in the water), and draws it to him; and he (the Hotri) then stands by those (Ekadhana pitchers) lest the evil spirits should injure them on the way.

Neshtar, lead up the wives! Ye bearers of the Ekadhana (cups), come hither! Agnîdh, step ever against the pit with the Vasatîvarî water and the Hotri's cup!' this is a composite direction.

The Gandharvas, surely, will hanker after the wives, and we shall carry off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.'
te patnīṣveva gandharvā jagṛdhurathaitamabhaye nāṣṭre yajñasya rasamājahruḥ //	They went with the wives; the Gandharvas did indeed hanker after the wives, and they (thegods) carried off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.

And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that oblation, and thus satisfied and pleased they fit that sap of the sacrifice together for him.

Evenas a coal is consumed by Fire, so is that oblation consumed by that deity. Now that water, which is in the Maitrâvaruna's cup, he will have to pour on the king (Soma); and ghee being a thunderbolt, and Soma seed, he makes (the ghee) float away lest he should injure that seed, Soma, by that thunderbolt, the ghee.

Close over the pit he[paragraph continues] (the Adhvaryu) makes the Vasatîvarî water and the Maitrâvaruna's cup touch one another, with, 'Water hath united with water, plants with plants!' the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day, both kinds he thereby mixes together.

But let him not do this; for when he pours (the water) together into the Âdhavanîya trough , then both kinds of sap are mixed together. Thereupon he pours the Vasatîvarî water into the Hotri's cup for the Nigrâbhyâs . And as to why he makes them touch one another close over the pit, it was from thence, forsooth, that the gods rose to heaven; he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.

But if it be not sufficient for an oblation, he takes another portion of ghee in four ladlings and offers it, with , 'Whatever mortal thou favourest in battles, whomsoever thou speedest in the race, he winneth unfailing strength, Hail!' He offers with (a prayer) to Agni, because the Agnishtoma ('Agni's praise') means Agni; thus he establishes the Agnishtoma in Agni. [He offers] with (a verse) containing the word 'mortal,' because the Agnishtoma is of the same measure as man.

And if it be either an Atirâtra or a Shodasin , let him neither make an oblation nor touch the middle enclosing-stick; having merely muttered (the above verse), let him silently betake himself (to the Havirdhâna) and enter it .

Now two and two[paragraph continues] (an even number) means a productive pair; and the one that remains over, remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity. And, moreover, that which remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity is the common property (sa-dhana) of these (others); and because it is the common property of these, therefore they are called Ekadhana (having one as their common property).

For twofold, verily, is this; there is no third, namely, the truth and the untruth; the gods, forsooth, are the truth, and men are the untruth. And the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: 'With the truth I will touch the stalks, with the truth I will take hold of Soma,' thus he thinks, and therefore he ties a piece of gold to that (ring-finger).

Moreover, in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone, Soma's own body); thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; therefore the press-stones are of rock.

For Savitri is the impeller of the gods; thus he takes it, impelled by Savitri. 'With the arms of the Asvins,' he says,--the Asvins are the Adhvaryus (of the gods): with their arms he thus takes it, not with his own. 'With the hands of Pûshan,' he says,--Pûshan is the distributor of portions: with his hands he thus takes it, not with his own. Moreover, that (stone) is a thunderbolt, and no man can hold it: by means of those deities he takes it.

Cult means sacrifice; he thereby means to say, 'Perform thou this great sacrifice!'--'well-gotten for Indra;' by 'well-gotten' he means to say, 'well-produced;' and Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, wherefore he says, 'for Indra;'--'by the most excellent bolt,'for he, Soma, is indeed the most excellent bolt , therefore he says, 'by the most excellent bolt;'--'the (cult) rich in food and sweetness and drink,' whereby he means to say, 'the (cult) rich in sap.'

For water is sap, and over it he invokes this blessing, 'Satisfy ye my whole self, satisfy my offspring, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' Now that Upâmsusavana (stone), forsooth, is in reality Âditya Vivasvant (the sun), it is the pervading vital air (vyâna) of this (sacrifice).

For Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'Thee for Indra;' and by saying 'with the Vasus, with the Rudras,' he assigns a share, along with (or after) Indra, to the Vasus and the Rudras.--'Thee for Indra, with the Âdityas!' whereby he assigns a share to the Âdityas along with Indra.--'Thee for Indra, the slayer of foes!' a foe is an enemy: 'Thee for Indra, the slayer of enemies,' he means to say. This is his (Indra's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the (other) gods.

Now Agni is Gâyatrî: he metes this out for Gâyatrî. And since Gâyatrî, as a falcon, fetched Soma from heaven, therefore she is (called) the Soma-bearing falcon: for that prowess of hers he metes out (for her) a second portion.

Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods, he thought within himself, 'I must not become sacrificial food for the gods with my whole self!' Accordingly he deposited those three bodies of his in these worlds.

Wherefore nothing whatsoever can check them when they flow; for they followed their own free will, thinking, 'To whom, forsooth, should we submit (or stop), we by whom Vritra was slain!' Now all this (universe), whatsoever there is, had submitted to Indra, even he that blows yonder.

And in like manner does this sacrificer now draw them to his breast: and this is their first draught of king Soma, in that he pours Nigrâbhyâ water thereon.

Thus invited they drink the first draught of king Soma.

Now whosoever kills a human Brâhman here, he, forsooth, is deemed guilty ,--how much more so he who strikes him (Soma), for Soma is a god. But they do kill him when they press him;--they kill him with that (stone): thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; and thus no guilt is incurred.. But if he hate no one, he may even think of a straw, and thus no guilt is incurred.

But, forsooth, it is these two, heaven and earth, that tremble for fear of that raised thunderbolt (the stone): hereby now he propitiates it for those two, heaven and earth; and thus propitiated it does not injure them. By 'Take strength!' he means to say, 'Take sap!'--'The evil is slain, not Soma!' he thereby slays every evil of his.

By performing the Nigrâbha, the gods then made him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort; and in like manner does this (sacrificer) now, by performing the Nigrâbha, make him (Soma) consort with those regions as his mate, his loved resort.

'O mother, satisfy (him)! may the noble meet together !' A mother[paragraph continues] (ambâ) is a woman, and the regions (dis, fem.) are women: therefore he says, 'O mother, satisfy (him)!--May the noble meet together!' The noble doubtless means people (creatures, offspring): he thus means to say, 'May the people live in harmony with each other!' Even the people that are far away (from each other) live in harmony with each other: therefore he says, 'May the noble meet together.'
atha yasmātsomo nāma /	Now as to why he is called Soma.

That form of his which was most pleasing he accordingly put aside. Thereupon the gods were victorious; they said, 'Draw that unto thee, for therewith shalt thou become our food!' He drew it to him even from afar, saying, verily, that is mine own (svâ me): hence he was called Soma.
atha yasmādyajño nāma /	Then as to why he is called Yagña (sacrifice).
ghnanti vā enametadyadabhiṣuṇvanti tadyadenaṃ janayanti sa tāyamāno jāyate sa yanjāyate tasmādyañjo yañjo havai nāmaitadyadyajña iti //	Now, when they press him, they slay him; and when they spread him , they cause him to be born. He is born in being spread along, he is born moving (yan gâyate): hence yan-ga, for 'yañga' they say, is the same as 'yagña.'

For it was indeed as a mortal that he uttered this, 'Thou alone wilt produce (me) from here, no other but thee!'
atha nigrābhyābhyo grahānvigṛhṇate /	And from the Nigrâbhyâ water they draw the several grahas (cups or libations of Soma).

In virtue of that prowess, then, the grahas are drawn from the Hotri's cup. Now the Hotri means the Rik (fem.), a woman; and from woman creatures are born here on earth: hence he makes him (Soma) to be born from that woman, the Rik, the Hotri; wherefore (he takes the grahas) from the Hotri's cup.
vyāna upāṃśusavana udāna evāntaryāmaḥ //	Hymn The Upâmsu (graha), forsooth, is the out-breathing of the Sacrifice , the Upâmsu-savana (press-stone) the through-breathing, and the Antaryâma (graha) the in-breathing.
atha yasmādupāṃśurnāma /	Now as to why it is called Upâmsu.
aṃśurvai nāma grahaḥ sa prajāpatistasyaiṣa prāṇastadyadasyaiṣa prāṇastasmādupāṃśurnāma //	There is a graha called Amsu , that is Pragâpati: his out-breathing is this (graha); and because it is his out-breathing, therefore it is called Upâmsu.

He purifies it with sprigs of Soma, thinking 'it shall be pure.' He purifies it with six (sprigs), for there are six seasons: it is by means of the seasons that he thus purifies it.
tadāhuḥ / yadāṃśubhirupāṃśu punāti sarve somāḥ pavitrapūtā atha kenāsyāṃśavaḥ pūtā bhavantīti //	As to this they say, 'When he purifies the Upâmsu by means of sprigs, and all (other) Soma-draughtsare purified by means of a strainer, whereby, then, do its sprigs become pure?'

Thus his sprigs become purified by means of the Svâhâ ('Hail!'). But this graha means everything, for it is the type of all the pressings .

They said, 'Let us completely establish the sacrifice: if the Asura-Rakshas should then attack us, our sacrifice will at least be completely established.'

And in like manner does this sacrifice now become completely established,--by means of the Yagus at this same graha; by means of the Sâman at the first chant; and by means of the Rik at the first recitation; and with this sacrifice thus completely established he subsequently worships.
sa vā aṣṭau kṛtvo 'bhiṣuṇoti / aṣṭākṣarā vai gāyatrī ghāyatram prātaḥ savanam prātaḥsavanamevaitatkriyate //	He presses (the Soma) eight times; for of eightsyllables consists the Gâyatrî, and the morning Soma-feast belongs to the Gâyatrî; thus this (first turn of pressing) is made to be the morning Soma-feast.

ekādaśākṣarā vai triṣṭuptraiṣṭubham mādhyandinaṃ savanam mādhyandinamevaitatsavanaṃ kriyate //	He then presses eleven times; for of eleven syllables consists the Trishtubh, and the midday Soma-feast belongs to the Trishtubh: thus this (second turn of pressing) is made to be the midday Soma-feast.
sa gṛhṇāti / devo devebhyaḥ pavasveti devo hyeṣa devebhyaḥ pavate yeṣām bhāgo 'sīti teṣāmu hyeṣa bhāgaḥ //	He draws (the juice into the cup) with, 'Grow thou pure, a god, for the gods--;' for he (Soma) is indeed a god, and for the gods he becomes pure;--'whose portion thou art;' for he indeed is their portion.
atha dvādaśa kṛtvo 'bhiṣuṇoti / dvādaśākṣarā vai jagatī jāgataṃ tṛtīyasavanaṃ tṛtīyasavanamevaitatkriyate //	He then presses twelve times; for of twelve syllables consists the Gagatî, and the evening Soma-feast belongs to the Gagatî: thus this (third turn of pressing) is made to be the evening Soma-feast.

And when he offers (that graha) he thereby completely establishes him.
aṣṭāvaṣṭau kṛtvaḥ / brahmavarcasakāmasyābhiṣuṇuyādityāhuraṣṭākṣarā vai gāyatrī brahma gāyatrī brahmavarcasī haiva bhavati //	'For one desirous of spiritual lustre (brahmavarkasa) he should press eight times at each (turn),' so they say;--for of eight syllables consists the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî is the Brahman: he indeed becomes endowed with spiritual lustre.
taccaturviṃśatiṃ kṛtvo 'bhiṣutam bhavati /	Thus the pressing amounts to twenty-four times (of beating).

This, however, is mere speculation: it is the other (manner) which is practised.
taṃ gṛhītvā parimārṣṭi /	Having drawn the graha, he wipes (the vessel) all round, lest any (Soma-juice) should trickle down.

Should he, however, desire to exorcise, he maydeposit it with, 'I put thee down, the out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus, forsooth, inasmuch as he (the Adhvaryu) does not quit his hold of it, it is not again in that (enemy); and thus both the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer live long.
amuṣya tvā prāṇamapidadhāmīti tathāha tasminna punarasti yanna sādayati teno prāṇānna lobhayati // sa vā antareva santsvāheti karoti /	Or he may merely cover (the vessel by his hand) with, 'I shut thee off, the out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus, forsooth, inasmuch as he does not deposit it, it is not again in that enemy; and thus he does not disorder the vital airs.

For the gods were afraid lest the Asura-Rakshas should destroy what part of this graha was previous to the offering. They offered it (symbolically) by means of the Svâhâ, while they were still inside (the cart-shed), and what was thus offered they afterwards offered up in the fire. And in like manner does he now offer it up by means of the Svâhâ, while he is still inside, and what has thus been offered he afterwards offers up in the fire.

For along the airthe Rakshas roams rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man here roams along the air, rootless and unfettered on both sides ; and, that formula being the Brahman (prayer), a slayer of the Rakshas, he, by means of that Brahman, renders the air free from danger and injury.
atha varaṃ vṛṇīte /	Thereupon he (the Sacrificer) asks a boon.
balavaddha vai devā etasya grahasya homam prepsanti te 'smā etaṃ varaṃ samardhayanti kṣipre na imaṃ grahaṃ juhavaditi tasmādvaraṃ vṛṇīte //	For the gods, forsooth, greatly desire to obtain the offering of that graha, and they grant to him that boon, in order that he may forthwith offer that graha to them: this is why he asks a boon.

'Hail! thee, O well-born, for Sûrya!' thus he utters the second (or inferior) 'Hail!' with regard to a subsequent (or higher; the highest) deity.

But were he to utter the second (or higher) 'Hail!' with regard to a preceding (or lower) deity , then it would be even higher than yonder sun: therefore he utters the second 'Hail!' with regard to a subsequent deity.

Thereupon he rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick from west to east with the palm of his hand turned upwards --whereby he puts that out-breathing into him as one tending away from him--with, 'Thee to the gods sipping motes of light!'
ya eṣa tapati tasya ye raśmayaste devā marīcipāstānevaitatprīṇāti ta enaṃ devāḥ prītāḥ svargaṃ lokamabhivahanti //	For in that orb which burns yonder he has just offered this (libation), and those rays thereof are the gods sipping motes of light: it is these he thereby gratifies; and thus gratified those gods convey him to the heavenly world.

And if he desire to exorcise, let him offer some spray (of Soma) which may adhere either to his arm, or to his breast, or to his garment, with, 'O divine plant, let that be true wherefore I pray thee: let N.N. be struck down by destruction falling from above, crash!' Even as one of (enemies) that are being slain might escape, so does this (sprig) fly away from those that are being pressed: thus nothing (hostile)--either running thither or running away --remains to him for whom he performs this. He deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!' for this (graha) indeed is his out-breathing.
dakṣiṇārdhe haike sādayanti /	Now some deposit it on the south part (of the khara ), for, they say, it is in that direction thatyonder (sun) moves.

He deposits it with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!' for this (graha) is indeed his out-breathing.
athopāṃśusavanamādatte /	He then takes the Upâmsu-savana (pressing-stone).

If there be any spray adhering to it, let him remove it with his hand, and then lay down (the stone) beside (the Upâmsu cup), with the face towards the north, with, 'Thee for the through-breathing!' for this (stone) is indeed his (Yagña's) through-breathing.
prāṇo ha vā asyopāṃśu / vyāna upāṃśusavana udāna evāntaryāmaḥ //	The Upâmsu (graha), forsooth, is his out-breathing, the Upâmsu-savana (stone) his through-breathing,and the Antaryâma (graha) his in-breathing.

Now, in drawing the Upâmsu (graha), he puts into him that out-breathing which tends away from him; and in drawing the Antaryâma, he puts into him that in-breathing which tends towards him. But this same in-breathing is confined within his self; and because it is confined (yam) within (antar) his self, or because these creatures are sustained (yam) by it, therefore it is called Antaryâma.

And thereby also that Upâmsu (libation) of his comes to be drawn from inside the strainer (i.e. from the pure Soma), for one and the same are the Upâmsu and Antaryâma, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing. And thereby, moreover, that (vital air) of his comes to be unceasing also at the other grahas.
atha yasmātsomam pavitreṇa pāvayati /	Now as to why he purifies the Soma by means of a strainer (pavitra).
yatra vai somaḥ svam purohitam bṛhaspatiṃ jijyau tasmai punardadau tena saṃśaśāma tasminpunardaduṣyāsaivātiśiṣṭameno yadīnnūnam brahma jyānāyābhidadhyau //	When Soma had oppressed his own family-priest Brihaspati, he restored to him (his property); and on his restoring it, he (Brihaspati) became reconciled to him. Still there was guilt remaining, if only for having contemplated oppressing the priesthood.
taṃ devāḥ pavitreṇāpāvayan / sa medhyaḥ pūto devānāṃ havirabhavattatho evainameṣa etatpavitreṇa pāvayati sa medhyaḥ pūto devānāṃ havirbhavati //	The gods purified him by some means of purification (or a strainer, pavitra), and, being cleansed and pure, he became the (sacrificial) food of the gods. Andin like manner does he now purify him by means of that strainer, and, being cleansed and pure, he becomes the food of the gods.
tadyadupayāmena grahā gṛhyante /	Then as to why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma .
iyaṃ vā aditistasyā adaḥ prāyaṇīyaṃ havirasāvādityaścarustadvai tatpureva sutyāyai sā heyaṃ deveṣu sutyāyāmapitvamīṣe 'stveva me 'pi prasute bhāga iti //	Now Aditi is this (earth), and hers was that prâyanîya oblation, that Âditya rice-pap . But that was, as it were, previous to the Soma feast: she desired to have a share along with the gods in the Soma feast, and said, 'Let there be for me also a share of the pressed Soma!'
te ha devā ūcuḥ / vyādiṣṭo 'yaṃ devatābhyo yajñastvayaiva grahā gṛhyantāṃ devatābhyo hūyantāmiti tatheti so 'syā eṣa prasute bhāgaḥ //	The gods said, 'This sacrifice has already been distributed among the deities: by means of thee the grahas shall be taken and offered to the deities!'-- 'So be it!' This, then, is her share of the pressed Soma.
tadyadupayāmena grahā gṛhyante /	And, again, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma.
iyaṃ vā upayāma iyaṃ vā idamannādyamupayacati paśubhyo manuṣyebhyo vanaspatibhya ito vā ūrdhvā devā divi hi devāḥ //	The Upayâma indeed is this (earth), since it is this (earth) that bears (upa-yam ) food here for cattle and men and trees; and the gods are above this, for the gods are in heaven.
tadyadupayāmena grahā gṛhyante / anayaiva tadgṛhyante 'tha yadyonau sādayatīyaṃ vā asya sarvasya yonirasyai vā imāḥ prajāḥ prajātāḥ //	The reason, then, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma, is that they are drawn by means of this (earth); and why he deposits them in the womb , is that this earth is the womb of everything, that it is from her that these creatures have sprung.
reto bhūtaṃ somamṛtvijo bibhrati yadvā ayonau retaḥ sicyate pra vai tanmīyate 'tha yadyonau sādayatyasyāmeva tatsādayati //	That same Soma the priests carry about as seed. And seed which is cast outside the womb is lost; but that which he deposits in the womb is indeed deposited in this earth.

He thus keeps the out-breathing and in-breathing distinct from each other: hence these two, even while being one and the same, are yet called differently 'out-breathing' and 'in-breathing.'
ahorātre ha vā asyaitau grahau / tayorudite 'nyataraṃ juhotyanudite 'nyataramahorātrayorvyākṛtyā ahorātre evaitadvyākaroti //	Now those two grahas are for him day and night; one of them he offers after sunrise and theother before sunrise, in order to keep day and night distinct from each other: he thus keeps day and night distinct.

taṃ rātrau juhotyaharevaitadrātrau dadhāti tasmādapi sutamiśrāyāmupaiva kiṃcitkhyāyate //	The Upâmsu, being the day, he offers in the night; and thus he puts the day into the night: whence even in the deepest darkness one distinguishes something .

'Preserve the riches! gain thee food in the sacrifice!'--riches mean cattle: 'Protect the cattle' he thereby means to say. 'Gain thee food in the sacrifice!'--food means creatures: he thus makes these eager to sacrifice, and these creatures go on sacrificing and praising and toiling.

But should he desire to exorcise, let him deposit it with 'I put thee down, the in-breathing of N.N.!'

And if he covers the Upâmsu (with his hand), let him also cover this; and if he does not cover the Upâmsu, let him also not cover this: as the performance regarding the Upâmsu, so regarding this (graha); for one and the same are these two, the Upâmsu and Antaryâma, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing.

But let him not do this, for they disorder the sacrificer's out-breathing and in-breathing.

How then could one offer it silently, for these two, the Upâmsu and Antaryâma, are one and the same, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing?
tenaivaitam mantreṇa juhoti svāṃkṛto 'si viśvebhya indriyebhyo divyebhyaḥ pārthivebhyo manastvāṣṭu svāhā subhava sūryāyetyukto yajuṣo bandhuḥ //	With the very same formula with which he offers the Upâmsu, he offers this (libation),--'Self-made thou art: for all powers divine and earthly: may the mind obtain thee! Hail!--thee, O well-born, for Sûrya!' The significance of this formula has been told.

For even now, after offering the Upâmsu, he rubbed it upon themiddle enclosing stick from west to east with the palm of his hand turned upwards; but here he does so from east to west with the palm of his hand turned downwards--whereby he puts the in-breathing into him as one tending towards him--with, 'Thee for the gods sipping motes of light!' The significance is the same as before.

He deposits them so as to touch one another; whereby he makes out-breathing and in-breathing touch one another, joins the out-breathings and in-breathings together.

At the evening Soma feast they are again used; whencethese birds fly drawing in their wings to fold them: this indeed is after the manner of the sacrifice.

And the Upâmsu-savana (stone) is the air, for the Upâmsu-savana is the through-breathing, and he who breathes through (in and out), breathes through this air.

He spake, 'Vritra is slain: do ye with the slain what ye list!'

Hence those (vessels), though belonging to various deities, are called 'vâyavya (Vâyu's vessels) .' His (Vâyu's) is that first Vashat of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him.

Thus that cup henceforward belonged to Indra and Vâyu, but theretofore it belonged to Vâyu alone.

Then he divided the (other) half into two parts and said, 'This is Vâyu's!--This is thine!' then he assigned to Indra a fourth part for his share--one fourth is the same as a quarter: henceforward that cup belonged, one fourth of it, to Indra.

Hence only that fourth part of speech is intelligible which men speak; but that fourth part of speech which beasts speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which birds speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which the small vermin here speaks is unintelligible.

As to why he says, 'Thee for the closely united,'--he who is Vâyu, is Indra; and he who is Indra, is Vâyu: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for the closely united!'

I might do this!' that is intelligence; and whenever that is accomplished, that is will . Now intelligence indeed is Mitra, and will is Varuna; and Mitra is the priesthood, and Varuna the nobility; and the priesthood is the conceiver, and the noble is the doer.
brahma ca kṣatraṃ ca tataḥ śa śākaiva brahma mitra ṛte kṣatrādvaruṇātsthātum //	Now in the beginning these two, the priesthood and the nobility, were separate: then Mitra, the priesthood, could stand without Varuna, the nobility.

So the two united; and therefrom resulted that graha to Mitra and Varuna.

It is, however, quite improper that a king should be without a Brâhman, for whatever deed he does, unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein he succeeds not. Wherefore a Kshatriya who intends to do a deed ought by all means to resort to a Brâhman, forhe verily succeeds only in the deed sped by the Brâhman.
athāto gṛhṇātyeva / ayaṃ vām mitrāvaruṇā sutaḥ soma ṛtāvṛdhā mamediha śrutaṃ havam upayāmagṛhīto 'si mitrāvaruṇābhyāṃ tveti //	Now he draws (the Maitrâ-varuna graha) from that (stream of Soma) , with , 'This Soma, O Mitra and Varuna, hath been pressed for you; ye holy, now hear my cry!--Thou art taken with a support !--Thee for Mitra and Varuna!'

Soma, forsooth, was Vritra. Now when the gods slew him, they said to Mitra, 'Thou also slayest!' But he liked it not and said, 'Surely, I am every one's friend (mitra): being no friend, I shall become an enemy (or, other than Mitra, Amitra).'--'Then we shall exclude thee from the sacrifice!'--Then said he, 'I, too, slay!' Thereupon the cattle went from him, saying, 'Being a friend, he has become an enemy!' Thus he was deprived of the cattle. By mixing (the Soma) with milk, the gods then supplied him with cattle; and in like manner does this (priest) now supply him (the sacrificer or Mitra) with cattle by mixing (the Soma) with milk.
śaśvaddha naiva cakame hantumiti tadyadevātra payastanmitrasya soma eva varuṇasya tasmātpayasā śrīṇāti //	As to this they say, 'Surely he liked it not to slay!' Thus, what milk there is in this (mixture) that belongs to Mitra, but the Soma belongs to Varuna: therefore one mixes it with milk.

Now as to why he says, 'Thee for truth and life,'--the truth is Mitra , since Mitra is the Brahman, and the truth is the Brahman (sacerdotium or sacred writ);--and life is Varuna, since Varuna is the year, and life is the year: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life!'

His boys , while playing, setting that decrepit, ghostlike man at nought, pelted him with clods.

Then Saryâta knew that this was Kyavana.

And from that same time his tribe lived at peace together. But Saryâta, the Mânava, departed forthwith, lest he should offend him a second time.
aśvinau ha vā idam bhiṣajyantau ceratuḥ /	Now the Asvins then wandered about here on earth performing cures.

She said, 'To whom my father has given me, him will I not abandon, as long as he lives!' But the Rishi was aware of this.

She told him all; and, when she had told him, he said, 'If they speak to thee thus again, say thou to them, ""But surely, ye are neither quite complete nor quite perfect, and yet ye deride my husband!"" and if they say to thee, ""In what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?"" say thou to them, ""Nay, make ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!""' They came again to her, and said to her the same thing."

They said, 'In what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?' She said, 'Nay, make ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!'
etaṃ hradamabhyavahara sa yena vayasā kamiṣyate tenodaiṣyatīti taṃ hradamabhyavajahāra sa yena vayasā cakame tenodeyāya //	They said, 'Take him down to yonder pool , and he shall come forth with whatever age he shall desire!' She took him down to that pool, and he came forth with the age he desired.

The Rishi himself answered them,--'In Kurukshetra yonder the gods perform a sacrifice and exclude you two from it: in that respect ye are incomplete, in that respect imperfect!' And the Asvins departed forthwith, and came to the gods, as they were performing a sacrifice, after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna.
upa nau hvayadhvamiti te ha devā ūcurna vāmupahvayiṣyāmahe bahu manuṣyeṣu saṃsṛṣṭamacāriṣṭam bhiṣajyantāviti //	They said, 'Invite us thereto!' The gods said, 'We will not invite you: ye have wandered and mixed much among men, performing cures.'

They drew this Âsvina cup for them; and those two became the Adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice, and restored the head of the sacrifice. Then, in the chapter of the divâkîrtyas , it is explained how they did restore the head of the sacrifice. Hence this libation is drawn after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna, for it was after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna that they arrived.

Accordingly they transferred that graha for them to a former time, to those belonging to two deities: hence that graha is drawn in the tenth place, and is consecrated by Vashat in the third place. And as to (the significance of) the Asvins,--the Asvins are manifestly those two, heaven and earth , for it is those twothat have obtained possession of everything here;--'the lotus-crowned' they (the Asvins) are called: Agni, forsooth, is the lotus of this earth, and the sun that of yonder sky.

Now as to why he takes (the graha) with a verse containing (the word) 'honey (madhu),' and deposits it with 'thee for the honey-loving!'

The vessel of the graha for Mitra and Varuna is goat-like : this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. The vessel of the graha for the Asvins is lip-shaped: this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. And the reason why (this belongs to) the Asvins is that the Asvins are the heads (mukhya, viz. of the sacrifice), and this head (mukha ) is supplied with lips: hence the vessel of the Asvina graha is lip-shaped.
cakṣuṣī ha vā asya śukrāmanthinau /	The Sukra and Manthin (grahas), forsooth, are his eyes.

tadenam manthaṃ karoti teno eṣa manthyetau ha vā āsām prajānāṃ cakṣuṣī ma yaddhaitau nodiyātāṃ na haiveha svau cana pāṇī nirjānīyuḥ //	He mixes it with (barley) meal: thus he makes it to be gruel (mantha), whence it is (called) Manthin. Now those two (sun and moon); forsooth, are the eyes of these creatures; for were those two not to rise, these (creatures) could not distinguish even their own hands.
tayorattaivānyataraḥ / ādyo 'nyataro 'ttaiva śukra ādyo manthī //	One of them is the eater, and the other thefood ; to wit, the Sukra is the eater, and the Manthin the food.

Now these two (cups) are drawn for one (person) and offered to another. There are two Asura-Rakshas, Sanda and Marka: for them they are drawn; and to deities they are offered.
yatra vai devāḥ /	The reason for this is as follows.
asurarakṣasānyapajaghnire tadetāveva na śekurapahantuṃ yaddha sma devāḥ kiṃ ca karma kurvate taddha sma mohayitvā kṣipra eva punarapadravataḥ //	Now when the gods drove away the Asura-Rakshas, they could not drive away these two; but whatever (sacrificial) work the gods performed, that these two disturbed, and then quickly fled.

They said, 'Let us draw two cups (of Soma juice) for them: they will come down to us, and we shall seize them and drive them away.' They accordingly drew two cups (of Soma) for them, and they both came down, and, having seized them, they (the gods) drove them away . This is why (the two cups) are drawn for Sanda and Marka, but are offered to deities.

In this, however, he merely speculated, but he did not practise it.

He deposits it on the south part (of the mount), for it is in that direction that yonder (sun) moves.

A tear of his fell down: therefrom the barley sprung; whence they say that the barley belongs to Varuna. Thus whatever part of his eye was injured on that occasion in (that part he now restores him and makes him whole by means of this (barley): therefore he mixes (the libation) with meal.

And the Adhvaryu takes the Sukra, the Pratiprasthâtri the Manthin.

In like manner the Pratiprasthâtri with, 'Swept away is Marka!' Thus even while drawing (the cups), they drive away the two Asura-Rakshas. With 'May the Sukra-sipping gods lead thee forward!' the Adhvaryu walks out (of the cart-shed); with 'May the Manthin-sipping gods lead thee forward!' the Pratiprasthâtri: thus they lead forward those two (libations) to the deities.

By saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he invokes a blessing upon the sacrificer.

By saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he invokes a blessing on the sacrificer.

Having gone round to the front (of the stake), they uncover (the cups), and offer them while standing in front: thereby they make them visible; whence every onesees yonder sun and moon when they go backwards. Hence also no one sees the seed which is cast forwards, but every one sees what is produced backwards.

Thus they make these two (cups) the resting-places of the eyes, and join the two eyes together: whence these two eyes are joined together with bones all round .

These two (chips), forsooth, are the kindlers of the eyes,--he kindles the eyes therewith; whence these eyes are kindled.

As the Vashat is uttered, the Adhvaryu offers; then the Pratiprasthâtri; then the cup-bearers (kamasâdhvaryu).

They offer while standing on both sides of the stake; for what the nose is, that is the sacrificial stake: hence these two eyes are on both sides of the nose.

Ye cup-bearers of the fire-priests , approach and fill up (the cups) with pure Soma!'--this is a composite direction. Having gone round (to behind the high altar) the Pratiprasthâtri pours his residue (of Soma) into the Adhvaryu's (Sukra) vessel; whereby he makes the food pay tribute to the eater. The Adhvaryu pours it into the Hotri's cup for drinking; because the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vashat; for the Vashat is the breath, and that breath has, as it were, departed from him while uttering the Vashat. Now the draught is breath: thus he puts that breath back into him.
atha yadete pratīcī pātre na haranti / harantyanyāngrahāṃścakṣuṣī hyete saṃsravameva hotṛcamase 'vanayati //	And the reason why they do not take thosetwo (cups) behind , but do so take the other cups, is that those two are the eyes. The residue (of Soma), then, he pours into the Hotri's cup.

Thereupon he approaches (to the Hotri's hearth) and sits down with his face to the west, with 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed!' for on this occasion the Agnîdh sacrifices last of those that sacrifice: hence he says, 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed.'

Therefrom they draw at the end the Hâriyogana cup : whereby the sacrifice is established at the end in this resting-place, the body (or its own self).

Hereby he makes that speech of renewed vigour; whence he speaks therewith in a different way, while yet the same, in order to avoid sameness; for were he to take it with, 'Thou art Âgrayana, thou art Âgrayana,' he would commit (the fault of) sameness: therefore he says, 'Thou art Âgrayana, a good âgrayana.'

'May Vishnu-guard thee with his might! guard thou Vishnu!' whereby he utters freed speech--Vishnu being the sacrifice--'May the sacrificeprotect thee with its power! protect thou the sacrifice!'--'Guard thou the Soma feasts all around!' whereby he means this very graha, because that belongs to all (three) Soma feasts .

Now that same speech (Vâk, fem.), being unsupported, lay exhausted. By means of the 'Hiṅ' the gods infused breath into that exhausted speech, for the 'Hiṅ' is breath, the 'Hiṅ' is indeed breath: hence one cannot utter the sound 'hiṅ' after closing his nostrils. By means of that breath she rose again, for when one who is exhausted takes breath, he rises again. And in like manner does he now infuse breath into the exhausted speech by means of the 'Hiṅ,' and through.

With, 'Thee for the All-gods! this is thy womb: thee for the All-gods!' he deposits (the cup); for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. He deposits it in the middle (of the mound); for this is his trunk, and that trunk is, as it were, in the middle. On the right (south) side of it is the Ukthya bowl, and on the left side the Âditya bowl.

Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes it the first of the second pressing, and the last of the first pressing : that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus. And because his body is thereby held together, therefore this (graha) is his vital energy.

Formerly these same (puroruk verses) were apart from the Riks, apart from the Yagus, and apart from the Sâmans.

For this (cup of Soma) is that part of his body from the navel downwards; and below, as it were, is what is from the navel downwards; and below, as it were, is what (one deposits) after pushing (the dust) aside and leaving not so much as a blade of grass between: therefore he deposits this (Dhruva graha) after pushing (the dust) aside, without leaving so much as a blade of grass between.

The creatures that are born therefrom after those (libations) which he deposits on the raised (mound), stand on this (earth) with something different from their own self,--for those which stand on hoofs indeed stand on this (earth) with something different from their own self. And when he deposits this (Dhruva cup) after shifting aside (the dust), and not leaving so much as a blade of grass between,--the creatures that are born thereafter from this (sacrifice), stand on this (earth) with their own self, namely, men and wild beasts

But this (libation) remains apart, (being) of one form like water. Hence while he eats the multiform food with that mouth (the fire), he lets flow from that opening the uniform (libation) like water. Then as to why it is called Dhruva.

And because they could not overturn that (northern cup) therefore it is called Dhruva (firm) .

This cup of Soma is her head; but the head means excellence, for the head indeed means excellence: hence people say of him who is the best man of a place, that 'so and so is the head of such and such a place.' And, indeed, the best man would come to harm, if this (cup) were to come to harm; and, the best man being the sacrificer, they watch (this cup) lest the sacrificer should come to harm.

This is her calf;--when they watch it, then they watch these calves for the sake of the milking: 'as they yield this milk, even so may this Gâyatrî yield all the sacrificer's wishes,'--this is why they watch it.

They come to this cup of Soma, and he (the Adhvaryu) pours it out; whereby he lets loose the Gâyatrî: 'Made over to the sacrificer, may this Gâyatrî yield all his desires!' for this reason he pours it out.

This is thy womb--thee for Vaisvânara!' therewith he deposits it after pushing (the dust) aside, and not leaving so much as a blade of grass between: for he indeed takes it for (Agni) Vaisvânara.

Whatever drops of that (Soma) are spilt here, to them he now wishes a safe journey to the Âhavanîya, for the Âhavanîya is the resting-place of offerings: this is why he offers the oblation of drops.

He bespeaks the chant right off , and they chant right off; for these chants, the Pavamânâh , are directed towards the gods, sincethe gods thereby attained to the heavenly world right off (straightway): therefore he bespeaks the chant right off, and right off they chant.

And in like manner do the priests thereby embrace the sacrificer and ascend from hence to the heavenly world: this is why they chant the Bahishpavamâna h ere. The Bahishpavamâna chant truly is a shipbound heavenwards: the priests are its spars and oars, the means of reaching the heavenly world.

And, indeed, every sacrifice is a ship bound heavenwards: hence one should seek to keep a blameworthy (priest) away from every sacrifice.

Prepare the cakes! go on with the victim!' The Agnîdh spreads the fires, that is to say, kindles them ; he strews that barhis , thinking, 'When the barhis is strewn, I will offer to the gods on the kindled (fire).'--'Prepare the cakes,' he says, because he is about to proceed with the cakes; and, 'Go on with the victim,' because he is about to get ready the victim .

If it be a Shodasin sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra in the third place, for the sixteenfold chant (shodasin) means Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let him slay one to Sarasvatî in the fourth place, for Sarasvatî is speech, and speech (vâk, fem.) is female, as the night (râtri, fem.) is female: he thus duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice .

All these (are Objects of one's) wishes: it is in order that those who are the deities of the sacrifice shall be well-pleased.

But it is by means of that sacrificial food, the piece of cake which he now puts in his hand, and by means of that (saying) of the seers which he now recites, it is thereby they (Indra and Agni) preserve him.

yadveva sanne 'cāvāke /	And again why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons, when the Akhâvâka is seated.

Hence this year revolves without end. When he has drawn this (libation), he does not deposit it: whence this year is ceaseless.

Nor does he utter a second Vashat, lest he should turn away the seasons. Simultaneously they (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) draw the two first and the two last libations: thus they embrace everything here by means of the year, and everything here is embraced within the year.

But were both to walk out together, or were both to enter together, these months would assuredly pass separated one from the other: therefore while out walks the one, in steps the other.

And, assuredly, were only this much (used), there would be nothing but night: it would never pass away.

These two are the spring (months ): because in spring plants sprout and trees are brought to ripeness, therefore these two are Madhu (sweet) and Mâdhava.

These two are the summer (months): because during them it burns fiercest, therefore these two are Sukra (clear) and Suki (bright).

These two are (the months) of the rainy season: it rains from yonder sky, and hence these two are Nabhas (mist, cloud) and Nabhasya.

These two are the autumn (months): because in autumn food (ûrg) and juice, (namely) plants, ripen, therefore these two are Isha and Ûrga.

These two are the winter (months): because the winter by force (sahas) brings these creatures into his power, therefore these two are Saha and Sahasya. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Tapas!' the Adhvaryu draws (the eleventh); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Tapasya!' the Pratiprasthâtri (the twelfth). These two are (the months) of the dewy season: because during them it freezes most severely, therefore these two are Tapas and Tapasya.

The Pratiprasthâtri then pours his residue into the Adhvaryu's vessel, or the Adhvaryu pours his residue into the Pratiprasthâtri's vessel. He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (to the Sadas) for the purpose of drinking it .

He draws it with the Sukra cup, for the Sukra (bright) is yonder burning (sun), andwhat rays of his there are, they are the All-gods: therefore he draws it with the Sukra cup.

And the response (song) is ecstasy (mada )--what ecstasy there is in the rik and that which there is in the Sâman, that is sap: this sap he now lays into the metres, and thus makes the metres of restored strength; and with them of restored strength they perform the sacrifice.

For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hotri) draws breath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the Adhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil spirits, the Rakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of the sacrificer's enemies.
caturakṣarāṇi ha vā agre candāṃsyāsuḥ /	Now, in the beginning the metres consisted of four syllables.

Then Trishtubh flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind one syllable. Then Gâyatrî flew up for Soma, and she came back bringing with her those syllables as well as Soma. Thus she came to consist of eight syllables: wherefore they say, 'Gâyatrî is octosyllabic.' With her they performed the morning feast of the Soma-sacrifice,--whence the morning feast pertains to Gâyatrî.

Thus the Trishtubh came to consist of eleven syllables, and therefore they say, 'The midday Soma feast pertains to Trishtubh.'

Thus the Gagatî came to consist of twelve syllables; and therefore they say, 'The evening Soma feast pertains to Gagatî.'

At the morning feast he should therefore respond with a complete (formula), for complete Gâyatrî returned. At the midday feast (he responds with a formula) containing once (the verb) 'to rejoice (mad) ,' for she (Trishtubh) came back, leaving one syllable behind; and with that same (formula) he then completes her, makes her whole,
yatra triṣṭubhaḥ śasyante /	When trishtubh verses were recited.

Let him respond with 'Om!' only, for that is truth, that the gods know.

But let him not do this; for surely, in whichsoever way he may respond, speech is obtained by him, since he responds by speech. Let him therefore respond with 'Om !' only, for that is truth, that the gods know.

Thereupon the Âgrayana, for that (cup) is drawn at all (three) feasts.

Now some draw the Marutvatîya after they have drawn the Ukthya; but let him. not do this,--let him rather draw the Ukthya after he has drawn the Marutvatîya.

He is so by means of these five grahas (cups of Soma ): for five are these fingers, and with the fingers he hurls (the thunderbolt).

Wherefore now also, when they (the Udgâtris) chant the midday Pavamâna, and safety and peace are secured, the dakshinâs are led forth. And so, forsooth, does he now by means of those five cups of Soma hurl the thunderbolt at the wicked, hateful enemy, and having smitten Vritra, the wicked, and safety and peace beingsecured, he leads forth the dakshinâs. This is why he draws those five cups.
tadyanmarutvatīyāngṛhṇāti /	Then as to why he draws the Marutvatîya cups.

But the Maruts, having on that account withdrawn, were standing on an Asvattha tree (Ficus Religiosa). Now Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people the noble becomes strong: therefore the two Ritu cups (they say) may be of asvattha wood; but in reality they are of kârshmarya wood.
upa māvartadhvaṃ yuṣmābhirbalena vṛtraṃ hanānīti te hocuḥ kiṃ nastataḥ syāditi tebhya etau marutvatīyau grahāvagṛhṇāt //	Indra called on them, saying, 'Do ye join me that with you as my force I may smite Vritra!' They said, 'What will be our (reward) then?' He drew those two Marutvatîya cups for them.
te hocuḥ / apanidhāyainamoja upāvartāmahā iti ta enamapanidhāyaivauja upāvavṛtustadvā indro 'spuṇutāpanidhāya vai mauja upāvṛtanniti //	They said, 'Having put aside this one (cup) for our vigour, we will join thee.' Having accordingly put it aside for their vigour , they joined him. But Indra sought to obtain it, thinking, 'They have come to me after putting aside their vigour.'

He drew a third cup for them, with, 'Thou art taken with a support,--thee for the vigour of the Maruts!' They then joined him with vigour,--and he conquered with them, and smote Vritra with them;--for Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people the noble becomes strong. Hence he now bestows that strength on the nobility, and therefore he draws the Marutvatîya cups. Let him draw them for Indra Marutvat (accompanied by the Maruts), and not for the Maruts likewise.
sa vā idrāyaiva marutvate gṛhṇīyāt /	For were he also to draw cups for the Maruts, he would make the people refractory to the nobility.

He draws them with the two vessels of the seasons, for the year, the sacrifice, means the seasons. There, at the morning Soma feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the grahas for the seasons ; and now they are covertly attendedto, in that he draws the Marutvatîya grahas with the two vessels of the seasons.

And even as the reed becomes leafless, so is he thereby freed from all evil, when one draws the Mâhendra cup.
yadveva māhendraṃ grahaṃ gṛhṇāti /	And again, why he draws the Mâhendra cup.

And, moreover, he forsooth make's him great for the slaughter of Vritra therefore also he draws the Mâhendra cup. He draws it in the Sukra vessel, for bright (sukra) and great indeed is he (the sun) that burns yonder: therefore he draws it in the Sukra vessel.

For our sake he waxed strong for heroic deed,--great and broad was he, andwell-shapen by the shapers .--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Mahendra!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mahendra!' he deposits it; for it is indeed for the Great Indra that he draws it.

Agnîdh, stir the sour milk! be thou mindful of Soma's (pap)!' It is for the evening's press-feast that those pressers press out (the Soma juice), for the evening feast they make the mortars resound, for the evening feast the Agnîdh stirs the sour milk, for the evening feast he boils the pap for Soma. For these two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are indeed rich in pure Soma, are rich in juice; but that third press-feast is emptied of the pure Soma. Hence he forms it from out of this midday feast; and thus that third press-feast becomes for him rich in pure Soma, rich in juice: this is why he now speaks that speech.

Whatever, therefore, fails in this sacrifice, when slain, that he now invigorates by means of gifts to the priests; then the sacrifice becomes indeed successful: for this reason he makes gifts to the priests.
tadvai ṣaḍdvādaśetyeva haviryajñe dadati /	Now at the Haviryagña, indeed, they give as little as six or twelve (cows ), but no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshinâs of less than a hundred.

Only by a hundred he invigorates him, and not by less than a hundred: wherefore no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshinâs of less than a hundred; nor should any one officiate as a priest for a sacrificer at a (Soma-sacrifice) where less than a hundred are given,--'lest he should be an eyewitness when they will but slay and not invigorate him (Soma).'

And the sacrifice to them is twofold, oblations (being the sacrifice) to the gods, and gifts to the priests being that to the human gods, to the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. With oblations, forsooth, one gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. These two kinds of gods, when gratified, convey him to the heavenly world.

'May there be a place for me in the world of the gods!' With this hope he offers whoever offers: that same sacrifice of his goes to the world of the gods; and behind it goes the gift he gives to the priests, and holding on to the gift follows the sacrificer.
catasro vai dakṣiṇāḥ /	Now, there are four (kinds of) gifts to priests,--gold, the cow, cloth, and the horse.

saurībhyāmṛgbhyāṃ juhoti /	He offers with two verses to the Sun.
tamasā vā asau loko 'ntarhitaḥ sa etena jyotiṣā tamo 'pahatya svargaṃ lokamupasaṃkrāmati tasmātsaurībhyāmṛgbhyāṃ juhoti //	For yonder world is shut off by darkness; and dispelling the darkness by that light he reaches the heavenly world: therefore he offers with two verses to the Sun.

The reason why he makes one or two oblations on the Âgnîdhra fire is that Agni rules over beasts (cattle) , and they lie round about him on every side: it is him he pleases by this oblation, and thus pleased he is gracious unto this (sacrificer), and the latter offers (to the priests a cow) graciously given up by him (Agni).

Thereupon, if he intends to give away a horse, harnessed or unharnessed, let him make a second oblation; but if not, he need not attend to this.
ayaṃ no agnirvarivaskṛṇotvayam mṛdhaḥ pura etu prabhindan ayaṃ vājānjayatu vājasātāvayaṃ śatrūnjayatu jarhṛṣāṇaḥ svāheti vājasā hyaśvaḥ //	He offers with , 'May this Agni make wide room for us: may he march in front smiting the haters! May he gain riches in the winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies! Hail!' for the horse is a winner of riches (spoils, prizes).

Standing in front of the hall, he respectfully addresses them with , 'By your beauty have I come to beauty.' Now at first cattle did not submit to being given away. Laying aside their own beauteous forms they approached with their (bare) bodies. The gods then went up to them from the offering ground with their (the animals’) own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resigned themselves and became well-disposed to being given away. And in like manner does he now go up to them from the offering ground with their own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resign themselves and become well-disposed to being given away.

And as to his givinga dakshinâ first to the Agnîdh, it was from thence (from the Âgnîdhra) that all the gods gained immortality: therefore he gives the dakshinâ first to the Agnîdh.

Now Atri was the Hotri of the Rishis. Then the darkness of the Asuras came rushing into the Sadas. The Rishis said to Atri, 'Come back here, and dispel this darkness!' He dispelled that darkness; and thinking, 'He indeed is the light who has dispelled this darkness,' they brought him this light, gold, for a sacrificial gift,--for gold is indeed light; and by that same splendour and energy the Rishi dispelled the darkness. And so does he now also dispel the darkness by that light: therefore he bestows gold on an Âtreya.

Then to the Udgâtri (chanter); then to the Hotri; then to the two Adhvaryus, seated in the cart-shed. Then, having returned (to the Sadas he presents gold) to the Prastotri; then to the Maitrâvaruna; then to the Brâhmanâkhamsin; then to the Potri; then to the Neshtri; then to the Akhâvâka; then to the Unnetri; then to the Grâvastut; then to the Subrahmanyâ. To the Pratihartri he presents it last, since he is the restrainer(pratihartri) : he thus in the end restrains (the cows) for him, and so they do not become lost to him.

Now when, in the beginning, Pragâpati gave gifts, Indra thought within himself, 'Everything here, forsooth, he will give away, and not anything will he leave for us.' He then, to stop the giving, raised up that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' and thereafter he (Pragâpati) gave no more. And in like manner is that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' now raised up to stop the giving, and thereafter he (the sacrificer) gives no more.

Then the Cow--thereby he preserves his own breath, for the cow is breath, since the cow is food, and breath also is food: her he gave to Rudra, the Hotri. Then Cloth--thereby he preserves his own skin, for the cloth is skin: this he gave to Brihaspati, who chanted.

That he accepts with , 'Who hath given it? to whom hath he given it? Hope hath given it, for Hope hath he given it: Hope is the giver, Hope the receiver. This to thee, O Hope!' Thus he assigns it to a deity.

Therefore he who is learned in the scriptures need not assign (the gift to a deity).

Between them the press-feasts are divided: the morning pressing belongs to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, and the third pressing to the Âdityas. But the morning pressing belonged to the Vasus exclusively, and the midday pressing to the Rudras exclusively, and the third pressing to the Âdityas conjointly (with others).

The gods said, 'So be it!' After the completion of the midday pressing, they offered that (libation) previous to the third pressing . And in like manner is that libation offered to this day after the completion of the midday pressing and previous to the third pressing.

The Adhvaryu calls for the (Agnîdh's) Sraushat, and after the Adhvaryu's libation the Pratiprasthâtri pours (his juice into the fire), and with this much 'Thee to the Âdityas!' he pours the remains (into the Âditya-sthâlî). In the same way at all (three dvidevatya libations). Thus, the reason why the Pratiprasthâtri draws the Soma-juice, is that they entered into the dvidevatya cups.

For, that second libation which he (the Pratiprasthâtri) makes, he makes to (Agni) Svishtakrit, and by means of the Svishtakrit these (dvidevatyas) are supplied with the Anuvashat; and thus those (libations) ofhis are supplied with the Anuvashat, having the (oblation to Agni) Svishtakrit performed for them. He offers on the north part (of the fire), for that is the region of that god : hence he offers on the north part.
yadveva pratiprasthātā pratinigṛhṇīte /	And again, why the Pratiprasthâtri draws the Soma.

He then covers it --for they were afraid of the Rakshas--with 'O Vishnu, Far-strider, here is thy Soma, protect it lest they should injure it!' For Vishnu is the sacrifice: to the sacrifice he thus makes it over for protection. Now, after the completion of the midday Soma feast and before the evening feast he says, 'Come hither, Sacrificer!'

They close both doors,--for they (the Âdityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He (the Adhvaryu) takes up the Âditya-sthâlî and Âditya-pâtra, and holds them close over the Pûtabhrit, 'lest (any Soma juice) should be spilt.'
atha gṛhṇāti / kadā cana starīrasi nendra saścāsi dāśuṣe upopennu maghavanbhūya innu te dānaṃ devasya pṛcyata ādityebhyastveti //	He then draws (the juice from the sthâlî into the pâtra) with , 'At no time art thou barren, and never failest thou the worshipper, O Indra; butmore and ever more is thy divine gift increased, O mighty lord!--Thee to the Âdityas!'
taṃ vai nopayāmena gṛhṇīyāt / agre hyevaiṣa upayāmena gṛhīto bhavatyajāmitāyai jāmi ha kuryādyadenamatrāpyupayāmena gṛhṇīyāt //	Let him not draw it with a 'support'--for it was originally drawn with a support--to avoid a repetition (of sacrificial performance); but were he now also to draw it with a support, he would certainly commit a repetition.
athāpagṛhya punarānayati / kadā cana prayucasyubhe nipāsi janmanī turīyāditya savanaṃ ta indriyamātasthāvamṛtaṃ divyādityebhyastveti //	Having withdrawn (the cup for a moment from the flowing juice), he again pours it in with , 'At no time art thou heedless, but watchest over both generations; the Soma feast is thy strength, O fourth Âditya: the ambrosia is ready for thee in the heavens!--Thee to the Âdityas!'

'He should put it right in the centre (of the Âditya cup),' they say, 'for that milk is right in the centre of cattle.' But let him rather put it in the back part (of the cup), for that milk is in the hind part of cattle.

sa gṛhṇāti /	This is why he takes sour milk.

Let your favour incline unto us, that it may set us free from all trouble!--Thee to the Âdityas!'

Now, in that he does not touch it either with the fringe or the straining-cloth, thereby that third pressing of his also becomes rich in pure Soma and juice: therefore he touches it neither with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth.

Thereupon he hands the Upâmsusavana to the Unnetri. Then he says to the Unnetri, 'Drop in the pressing-stones!' He drops them either into the Âdhavanîya or into a cup .

If he likes, he may now enumerate (their qualities); but let him rather enumerate them, after he has called for the Sraushat,--'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering prayer) to the Âdityas, the beloved, rite-loving, law-loving lords of the great abode, the rulers of the wide air.' He offers, as the Vashat is pronounced. He (the Hotri) pronounces no Anuvashat, lest he should consign the cattle to the fire. The remains (of juice in the sthâlî and graha) he (the Adhvaryu) hands to the Pratiprasthâtri.
atha punaḥ prapadya /	Thereupon he again enters (the Havirdhâna) and draws the Âgrayana graha .

This is why the Pratiprasthâtri holds out the two residues .

Now here (at the evening feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the seasons, nor is any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels.

mano ha vā asya savitātmāgrayaṇa ātmanyevaitanmano dadhāti prāṇo ha vā asya savitātmāgrayaṇa ātmanyevaitatprāṇaṃ dadhāti //	He draws it from the Âgrayana graha; for Savitri is his mind, and the Âgrayana is his body (or self): he thus puts the mind into the body. Savitri is his breath, and the Âgrayana is his body: he thus puts the breath into the body.

And Savitri is his breath: hence this breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savitri!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering prayer) to the god Savitri!' The Vashat having been pronounced, he offers. He (the Hotri) pronounces no Anuvashat ,--for Savitri is his mind,--'lest he should consign his mind to the fire;' and Savitri being his breath,--'lest he should consign his breath to the fire.'

yadveva vaiśvadevaṃ grahaṃ gṛhṇāti /	And again why he draws the Vaisvadeva graha.

Therewith hedeposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it.

'--'By thee these vessels would be yoked, and by thee they would be unloosed!'--Hence those vessels are yoked by that (Vâyu), when he (the Adhvaryu) draws the (cups) for Indra and Vâyu and so forth . And now those vessels are unloosed by him, when he says, 'with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose them;'--teams mean cattle: thus he unlooses those vessels by means of cattle.

And had he returned at the midday pressing--the midday pressing belonging to Indra, and Indra being the nobility--cattle would have come to be with nobles only. But in that he returned at the evening pressing--the evening pressing belonging to the All-gods, and the All-gods being everything here--therefore there are cattle everywhere here.

It is a rice-pap (karu), for rice-pap is food for the gods, since rice-pap is boiled rice, and boiled rice is clearly food: therefore it is a rice-pap.

He offers it at the evening feast, because the evening feast belongs to the All-gods : thus he does not cause discord. He recites no invitatory prayer (but only an offering prayer), for the Fathers have passed away once for all: hence he recites no invitatory prayer.

Whatever oblations have been offered previous to this (karu), therefrom he separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord.

Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the Saumya (rice-pap)!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.

From whatever oblations he intends to offer hereafter, he thereby separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord. If he chooses, he may offer (ghee) on both sides (before and after the Soma's rice-pap); or, if he chooses, he may offer on one side only .

Therein the Adhvaryu takes ghee by four ladlings (with the dipping-spoon) and pours it on the Dhishnya hearths by means of fagots (held over them). The reason why he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots is this. Because, on a former occasion , the gods said to those (Gandharva Soma-wardens), 'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering,' that same offering of ghee now falls to their share at the evening pressing, but not one of Soma, in that he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots.
āgnīdhrīye punarāghārayantyudagna idaṃ karmānusaṃtiṣṭhātā iti tadu tathā na kuryānmārjālīya evottamam //	Now some make a second pouring on the Âgnîdhrîya hearth, thinking, 'In the North (or upwards) shall this sacred work of ours be accomplished!' but let him not do it in this way, but rather the Mârgâlîya last .

For from the sacrifice creatures are produced; and being produced from the sacrifice, they are produced from union; and being produced from union, they are produced from the hind part of the sacrifice;--hence he thereby produces them from a productive union, from the hind part of the sacrifice: therefore he draws the Pâtnîvata cup.
taṃ vā upāṃśupātreṇa gṛhṇāti /	He draws it with the Upâmsu vessel.

Now the breath (prâna, masc.) is male, and the wife is female: a productive union is thus brought about.
vīryaṃ vai puroruṅnetstrīṣu vīryaṃ dadhānīti tasmādapurorukkaṃ gṛhṇāti //	He draws it without a puroruk ,---the puroruk being manhood,--lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he draws it without a puroruk.

atha yaḥ pracaraṇyāṃ saṃsravaḥ pariśiṣṭo bhavati /	He (the Adhvaryu) then mixes it with the residue (of ghee) which is left in the prakaranî spoon.

And in like manner does he now, by that thunderbolt, the ghee, smite the wives and unman them; and thus smitten and unmanned, they neither own any self nor do they own any heritage.

In that he mixes with 'I--I,' thereby he bestows manhood on men.

The Agnîdh is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about. He offers with , 'O Agni, wife-leader !'--Agni is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about.

The Adhvaryu takes a draught of Soma to the Agnîdh, and the latter says, 'Adhvaryu, invite me!' he should not invite him, since how can there be an invitation of one smitten and unmanned? He should nevertheless invite him: they offer in his fire, and utter the Vashat,--therefore he should invite him.

Neshtri, lead up the lady, and make her exchange looks with the Udgâtri! Unnetri, fill up the Hotri's cup, and let no Soma-juice remain!' Thus, if it be an Agnishtoma sacrifice.

The Neshtri leads up the lady and makes her exchange looks with the Udgâtri , with 'Thou art Pragâpati, themale, the bestower of seed: lay thou seed into me!' The Udgâtri is Pragâpati, and the lady is a woman: a productive union is thus brought about.

And whenever the metres gratified the gods, then the gods gratified the metres. Now it has been previous to this, that the harnessed metres have drawn the sacrifice to the gods, that they have gratified them :
atha hāriyojanaṃ gṛhṇāti / candāṃsi vai hāriyojanaścandāṃsyevaitatsaṃtarpayati tasmāddhāriyojanam gṛhṇāti //	He now draws the Hâriyogana graha--the Hâriyogana being the metres--it is the metres he thereby gratifies: this is why he draws the Hâriyogana graha.
taṃ vā atiriktaṃ gṛhṇāti / yadā hi śamyorāhāthainaṃ gṛhṇātīdaṃ vai devā atha candāṃsyatiriktānyatha manuṣyā atha paśavo 'tiriktāstasmādatiriktaṃ gṛhṇāti //	He draws it as an additional (libation); sincehe draws it when he (the Hotri) pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing .' For there are here the gods, and the metres in addition to them; and there are men, and beasts in addition to them: therefore he draws it as an additional one.
droṇakalaśe gṛhṇāti /	He draws it in the Dronakalasa.

When the gods slew him, his head rolled off : it became the Dronakalasa. Thereinto flowed together so much of the juice as it could hold ; that was in excess; and so is this graha in excess: he thus puts the excess.
taṃ vā apurorukkaṃ gṛhṇāti /	to the excess,--therefore he draws it in the Dronakalasa.
candobhyo hyenaṃ gṛhṇāti sa yadevainaṃ candobhyo gṛhṇāti teno hāsyaiṣa puroruṅnānbhavati tasmādapurorukkaṃ gṛhṇāti //	He draws it without a puroruk-formula, for he draws it for the metres; and in that he draws it for the metres, even thereby that (graha) of his becomes supplied with a puroruk: therefore he draws it without a puroruk.
athāto gṛhṇātyeva /	He now draws it from that (Âgrayana graha) with (Vâg. S.
upayāmagṛhīto 'si harirasi hāriyojano haribhyāṃ tvetyṛkṣāme vai harī ṛkasāmābhyāṃ hyenaṃ gṛhṇāti //	VIII, it), 'Thou art taken with a support: of bay colour art thou, meet for the team of bay steeds,--thee to the pair of bay steeds!' Now, the two bay horses are the Rik and Sâman: it is for the Rik and Sâman that he draws it.
haryordhānā stha sahasomā indrāyeti tadyadevātra mitaṃ ca cando 'mitaṃ ca tadevaitatsarvam bhakṣayati //	He then pours parched grain into it with, 'Ye are the bays’ grains, united with the Soma for Indra!' Whatever metres there are, both measured and unmeasured, they all thereby drink (of the Soma ).

Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Prompt (the Hotri to pronounce the offering prayer on) the Soma-draughts with grain brought forward !' and offers as the Vashat and Anuvashat are uttered. They then divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.

But let him not do it thus; for the other draughts are (taken by the respective priests) according to the kamasa cups, but this one is in excess: therefore there is a draught in it for all of them,--for this reason they divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.

They only drink it in with their breath , with , 'What horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine ;' for they are cattle: therefore he says, 'what horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine;'--'Of that draught, offered with Yagus, praised by chants ,'--for Yagus-prayers have indeed been offered, and chants have been chanted;--'sung by hymns,'--for songs (sastras) have been sung;--'Of the invited do I drink, invited,'--for invited, he now drinks of the invited.
tā nāgnau prakireyuḥ / neduciṣṭamagnau juhavāmetyuttaravedāveva nivapanti tathā na bahirdhā yajñādbhavanti //	They must not throw them into the fire, lest they offer remains (of offerings) in the fire. They rather throw them on the high altar: thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice.

But the yoked (animal) galls or scratches itself; and water is a means of soothing, a medicine: thus wherever in this (sacrifice) they gall or scratch themselves--water being a means of soothing--they soothe by that means of soothing, water; they heal it by water.

And, moreover, they thus deposit that holy work into their own self: therefore they touch their faces.

The reason why he offers nine Samishtayagus is that those stotra-verses at the Bahishpavamâna chant amount to nine. Thus there is at both ends an inferior (incomplete) virâg , for thesake of production: it was from that same inferior (lower) source of production on both sides that Pragâpati produced the creatures,--from the one (he created) the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground. And in like manner does he (the Adhvaryu) now create creatures from that lower source of production on both sides,--from the one the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground.

It is these same deities he thereby dismisses in due form whithersoever their course lies.

Thus they heal what was torn.

Now that body (of Soma, i.e.the Soma-husks),--there is no sap in it; (yet) it is not to be cast away: they take it down to the water and--water being sap--he puts that sap into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and thus he produces him from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer) : and because they take it down (ava-hri ) to the water, therefore (the bath is called) avabhritha.
atha samiṣṭayajūṃṣi juhoti /	In the first place he performs the Samishtayagus offerings, for the Samishtayagus are the extreme end of the sacrifice.

Now when they take the Soma-husks down to the water, that forsooth is the wishing of 'good-speed !' to it, and this now is the 'good-speed!' to him (the sacrificer); for snakes are like rope, and snakes' haunts are like wells (pits), and there is as it were a feud between men and snakes: 'Lest that should spring therefrom,' he thinks, and therefore he says, 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!'

The reason why he sings the Sâman is that the evil spirits may not injure that body of his outside the sacrifice, for the Sâman is a repeller of the evil spirits.
āgneyyāṃ gāyati / agnirhi rakṣasāmapahantāticandasi gāyatyeṣā vai sarvāṇi candāṃsi yadaticandāstasmādaticandasi gāyati //	He (the Prastotri) sings a (verse) to Agni, for Agni is a repeller of the evil spirits. He sings in the Atikhandas; for this, the Atikhandas, is all the metres : therefore he sings in the Atikhandas.
agniṣṭapati pratidahatyahāvo 'hāva iti tannāṣṭrā evaitadrakṣāṃsyato 'pahanti //	He sings, 'Agni burneth, Agni encountereth with flames,--Ahâvah! Ahâvah !' Thus he drives the evil spirits away from here.

tamapo 'vakramayanvācayati /	But if he does not find such, he may descend into any water.
namo varuṇāyābhiṣṭhito varuṇasya pāśa iti tadenaṃ sarvasmādvaruṇapāśātsarvasmādvaruṇyātpramuñcati //	While he makes him descend into the water, he bids him say, 'Homage be to Varuna: downtrodden is Varuna's snare!' thus he delivers him from every snare of Varuna, from every (infliction ) of Varuna.

In every homestead offer thou the log, O Agni! let thy tongue dart forth towards the ghee,--Hail!'

It is him he kindles by this kindling-stick and by thisoblation, thinking 'On the kindled (fire) will I offer to the gods!'

He offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis --the Barhis being offspring, and the expiatory bath belonging to Varuna--lest Varuna should seize upon his offspring. This is why he offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis.
atha vāruṇa ekakapālaḥ puroḍāśo bhavati /	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Varuna.

Now that body: there is no sap in it. But the cake is sap: that sap he puts into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and so produces him from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer): hence there is a cake on -one potsherd for Varuna.

Here now some make two cuttings from the Soma-husks, but let him not do so; for that (heap of husks) is an empty body, unfit for offering. He makes two cuttings (from the cake) and bastes them once with ghee, and anoints (replenishes the places whence) the cuttings (have been made).

This is for (Agni) Svishtakrit ; and as to why he does not say 'To Agni,' it is lest Varuna might seize upon Agni. If before he has cut twice from the Soma-husks, he now does so once, but if (he did) not, he need not heed it. He then bastes it twice with butter on the upper side; and having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer to Agni and Varuna!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.
ṣaḍāhutayo bhavanti ṣaḍvā ṛtavaḥ saṃvatsarasya saṃvatsaro varuṇastasmātṣaḍāhutayo bhavanti // etadādityānāmayanam /	Now these are six oblations; for there are six seasons in the year, and Varuna is the year: hence there are six oblations. This is the course of the Âdityas ; and these Yagus, they say, belong to the Âdityas.

And if the sacrificer tell him to do otherwise, then he should do otherwise. He may also perform those same four fore-offerings,--omitting that to the Barhis--two butter-portions, (the oblations of cake) to Varuna and Agni-Varuna, and two after-offerings,--omitting the one to the Barhis;--this makes ten. Now the virâg consistsof ten syllables, and the sacrifice is virâg: thus he makes the sacrifice to be like the virâg.

Whatever is good in the sacrifice, that he thereby puts into him.

He thereby kindles the sacrificer himself,for along with the kindling of the gods the sacrificer is kindled . He proceeds with the rice-pap to Aditi, as the concluding oblation.
ādityena caruṇodayanīyena pracarati /	The reason why there is a rice-pap for Aditi is this.
tadyadādityaścarurbhavati yadevaināmado devā abruvaṃstavaiva prāyaṇīyastavodayanīya iti tamevāsyā etadubhayatra bhāgaṃ karoti //	Because, on that former occasion , the gods said to her, 'Thine forsooth shall be the opening, and thine the concluding oblation,' therefore he prepares that share for her at both ends (of the Soma-sacrifice).
sa yadamutra rājānaṃ kreṣyannupapraiṣyanyajate /	And because, on that occasion, he offers when about to go forth (upa-pra-i) to buy the king (Soma), therefore that (opening oblation) is called Prâyanîya.

For this indeed is one and the same oblation: to Aditi belongs the opening, to Aditi the concluding (oblation); for Aditi is this (earth).

so 'gnimeva prathamaṃ yajati /	But now that it is known, he performs in the proper order.
atha somamatha savitāramatha pathyāṃ svastimathāditiṃ vāgvai pathyā svastiriyamaditirasyāmeva taddevā vācam pratyaṣṭhāpayantseyaṃ vāgasyām pratiṣṭhitā vadati //	To Agni he offers first, then to Soma, then to Savitri, then to Pathyâ Svasti, then to Aditi, Now Pathyâ Svasti (the wishing of a 'happy journey')is speech, and Aditi is this (earth): on her the gods thereby established speech, and thus established thereon speech speaks here.

yadvā ījānasya sviṣṭam bhavati mitro 'sya tadgṛhṇāti yadvasya duriṣṭam bhavati varuṇo 'sya tadgṛhṇāti //	Whatever part of his (sacrifice) who has offered is well-offered that part of his Mitra takes, and whatever is ill-offered that Varuna takes.

This forsooth is his own sacrifice , his own merit. And again, why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varuna.

From it the coals (aṅgâra) sprung, and from the coals the Aṅgiras; and after that the other animals .

And when no sap whatever remained,--thence was produced that barren cow belonging to Mitra and Varuna; wherefore that (cow) does not bring forth, for from sap seed is produced, and from seed cattle. And because she was produced at the end, therefore she comes after the end of the sacrifice. Hence also a barren cow for Mitra and Varuna is the most proper here: if he cannot obtain a barren cow, it may also be a bullock .
athetaraṃ viśve devā amarīmṛtsyanta / tato vaiśvadevī samabhavadatha bārhaspatyā so 'nto 'nto hi bṛhaspatiḥ //	Then the Visve Devâh applied themselves a second time: thence the Vaisvadevî (cow) was produced; then the Bârhaspatyâ: that is the end, for Brihaspati is the end.

Those (three) cows are everything, (when offered) thus in the proper order: first one to Mitra and Varuna, then one to the All-gods, then one to Brihaspati.

Its invitatory and offering prayers are five-footed paṅktis . For at this time the sacrifice of him who has sacrificed is, as it were, exhausted in strength: it, as it were, passes away from him. Now all sacrifices are Agni, since all sacrifices are performed in him, the domestic sacrifices as well as others. He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his isnot exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.

He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.

Or an ox, for such a one is of Agni's nature as regards its shoulder, since its shoulder (bearing the yoke) is as if burnt by fire.

For Vishnu is the sacrifice: he thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him. And let him on this occasion give as much as he can afford, for no offering, they say, should be without a Dakshinâ. When this Udavasânîyâ-ishti is completed, he offers the (ordinary) evening (milk) offering ,--but the morning offering at its proper time.

The omentum having been pulled out , let him tell (the slaughterer) to search groping for an embryo. If they do not find one, why need they care? and if they find one, atonement is made therefore.

Let him bid (theslaughterer) get ready the pot (sthâlî) and the cloth (ushnîsha) .

Having performed with the omentum, both the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer return (to the sacrificial ground). The Adhvaryu says, 'Pull out that embryo!' otherwise he would not pull it out from the womb, since it is only pulled out from the womb of a sick or dead (female); but when the embryo is full grown, then indeed it comes out through birth: let him bid him pull it out even after tearing asunder the thighs.

But let him not do so; for that (embryo) surely has its limbs undeveloped. Having cut it below the neck, they should let that fat juice drip into the pot; for that same juice drips from all its limbs, and thus it is a portion cut out from all its limbs. He then cuts the sacrificial portions of the cow in the same way in which they are (usually) portioned off. They cook them on the cooking-fire of the animal offering: at the same time they cook that fat juice.

After the Adhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasthâtri offers (the fat juice)--

Thus, if it be a male (embryo); but if it be a female one, with, 'Her whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with her mother, Hail!' And, if it be an indistinguishable embryo, let him offer in making it male, since embryos (garbha, masc.) are male, 'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with his mother, Hail!' For on that former occasion, when they tear out (the embryo) they separate it from its mother: now, having rendered it successful by means of the Brahman, the Yagus, he brings it again together with its mother in the midst of the sacrifice.

The Pratiprasthâtri comes and takes all that fat juice, and pours twice (ghee) thereon. Having called for the Sraushat, the Adhvaryu says, 'Prompt!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered. After the Adhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasthâtri offers,

He thereby magnifies her (the cow): far more, forsooth, does he gain by offering an eight-footed one, than by one not eight-footed.

They may expose it on a tree; forembryos have the air for their support, and the tree is, as it were, the same as the air: thus he establishes it on its own support. But, say they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall expose him dead on a tree,' then verily it would be so.

And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes it with the Maruts .

He utters no Svâhâ (hail), for the Maruts, the clans of the gods are no oblation-eaters, and no oblation, as it were, is what is offered without Svâhâ. And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes it with the Maruts.

For Indra seized upon the strength, the fury (haras) of his enemies, the Asuras; and in like manner does he (the sacrificer) now seize upon the strength, the fury of his enemies: therefore he draws the graha with a verse to (Indra) Harivant; they chant verses to Harivant, and he (the Hotri) afterwards recites verses to Harivant.

The Anushtubh, then, is over and above (ati-rikta), and he thus makes that (Soma of the Shodasin) to remain over: hence he takes it with an Anushtubh.

He (the Adhvaryu) bespeaks it before the setting of the sun; and after sunset he (the Hotri) follows it up by reciting the sastra: thus he thereby joins day and night together,--therefore he bespeaks (the stotra) before thesetting of the sun, and after sunset he follows it up by reciting the sastra .

Or he might draw them from the Pûtabhrit, at the midday pressing, after drawing the Ukthya, or when about to bespeak (the chant), for the Ukthya indeed is the same as that undefined self of his.

But the Sukra (bright) is the same as he that burns yonder, and he indeed is Indra; and of animals, man is Indra-like : whence he rules over animals.

And such-like is the Ritu cup , and suchlike the head of the one-hoofed. The Âgrayanacup, the Ukthya cup, and the Âditya cup,--after them cows are produced. Now, these are again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.

Now, the Dronakalasa is Pragâpati;--he turns unto these creatures, and fosters them, and kisses them : he fosters them in that he produces them.

But if there be six seasons in the year, then the Âditya cup is the sixth of them.

Having drawn the Asvina graha, he makes (the sacrificer) eye (the several cups, while muttering) the Avakâsa formulas .

Then the Upâmsusavana stone with, 'For my through-breathing, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Antaryâma cup with, 'For mine up-breathing, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Aindravâyava with, 'For my voice, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Maitrâvaruna with, 'For mine intelligence and will, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Asvina with, 'For mine ear, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Sukra and Manthin with, 'For mine eyes, givers of lustre, become ye pure for lustre!'

Then the Ukthya with, 'Formy vigour, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Dhruva with, 'For my life, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the two Soma-troughs (Pûtabhrit and Âdhavanîya) with, 'For all mine offspring, givers of lustre, become ye pure for lustre!' Now the two troughs belong to the All-gods, for therefrom they draw (Soma) for the gods, therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: therefore the two Soma-troughs belong to the All-gods.

Which one art thou?'--Ka is Pragâpati;--'Whose (kasya, or Ka's) art thou? who (ka) art thou by name?'--Ka ('who') by name is Pragâpati;--'Thou upon whose name we have thought,' for he indeed thinks upon his name;--'Thou whom we have gladdened with Soma;'--for he indeed gladdens him with Soma. Having drawn the Âsvina cup, he prays for blessing part after part (of the sacrifice) with, 'May I be abundantly supplied with offspring,' thereby he prays for offspring;--'abundantly supplied with men,' thereby he prays for men (heroes);--'abundantly supplied with food!' thereby he prays for prosperity.

Having drawn the Âsvina cup, he (thus) produces the whole sacrifice; and having produced the whole sacrifice, he deposits it in his own self, and makes it his own.

Pragâpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and in like manner are they produced therefrom even to this day.

And there are thirty-three gods, and Pragâpati is the thirty-fourth;--thus he makes him (the sacrificer, or Yagña) to be Pragâpati : now that is, for that is immortal, and what is immortal that is. But what is mortal that also is Pragâpati; for Pragâpati is everything: thus he makes him to be Pragâpati, and hence there are these thirty-four utterances, called expiations.

For Vishnu is the sacrifice, and it is that (sacrifice) of his which now undergoes distress; and Varuna is the inflicter: thus by both these deities--that whose (sacrifice) undergoes distress, and that which inflicts it--he heals (the joint of the sacrifice), by both he puts it together.

On the first day he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the second day he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the third day he brings three hundred and thirty-three. Then that one-thousandth is left over.

He may lead her up (to the sacrificial ground) on the first day; for she, the Sâhasrî, is in reality Vâk, and hers, Vâk's, is that thousandfold progeny .

If she goes northwards, let him know that the sacrificer will be more glorious in this world. If she goes westwards, let him know that he will be rich in dependants and crops. If she goes southwards, let him know that the sacrificer will quickly depart from this world. Such are the ways of knowledge.

If he intends to give two to any one, let him pass over a decad to five such (priests). If he intends to give three to any one, let him pass over a decad to three such . If he intends to give five toany one, let him pass over a decad to two such. Thus up to a hundred: and thus this perfect Virâg of his becomes a cow of plenty for him in yonder world.

They sit near holding that (cup); and he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, when the time of that (cup comes), he utters 'Him' and deposits it.

In that, at the morning pressing, he draws first the Aindravâyava cup; and at the midday pressing the Sukra cup; and at the evening pressing the Âgrayana cup,--thereby forsooth the Adhvaryu transposes (the cups).

But if they do not catch any, let them perform, as far as is in their power, after pouring out some of the Âgrayana and pouring (water) thereto from other ekadhana pitchers. And if the trough bursts before the dakshinâ (cows) have been led up, let him then give one cow; and after coming out from the purificatory bath, let him be consecrated again; for the atonement for that (mishap) is a second sacrifice.

Hence when they draw that (cup) they produce that self of his. Therein they lay these vital airs, according to as these vital airs, the grahas, are explained ; and verily the sacrificer is born with his whole body in yonder world.

And Pragâpati is the fourth over and above these three worlds: thus he obtains Pragâpati by the fourth (corner): therefore he draws it with a square vessel.

It should be drawn at (a sacrifice) where the entire property is given away, for the entire property is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It should be drawn at a Visvagit with all the Prishthas, for the Visvagit ('all-conquering') is everything, and this (cup) is everything. It should be drawn at a Vâgapeya and Râgasûya, for that is everything.

If it be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him seize as the second (victim) one for Indra and Agni, for the hymns (uktha) belong to Indra and Agni. If it be a Shodasin sacrifice, let him seize as the third (victim) one for Indra; for the Shodasin (graha) is Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let him seize as the fourth (victim) one for Sarasvatî; for Sarasvatî is Vâk (speech), and Vâk is a female, and so is râtri (fem., 'night') female.

Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw this Mahâvratîya (cup) and drew it for him: thereby they restored his joints.

And because (they say), 'Great, indeed, is this vrata whereby he has raised himself,' therefore it is called Mahâvratîya.

He approaches either the rising or the setting sun, thinking, 'Thou art the seizer, seize thou N.N. by such and such a disease! may N.N. not obtain such and such!' (naming) him whom he hates; or with, 'May such and such a wish not be fulfilled to him!' and, assuredly, that wish is not fulfilled to him for whom he thus approaches (the sun).

Indra sat on the south side, and they entered upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury. Therefore let him who is the strongest sit on the south side, and let them then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury. Now he, forsooth, who is the most learned of Brâhmans, is the strongest of them; and as now any one is (able to become) a (superintendent) Brahman --nay, does he not sit still?--therefore whosoever is the strongestof them, let him sit on the south side, and let them then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.

The significance is the same (as before) .

Therewith he hastes to Savitri for his impulsion, for he is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods; and 'O Brihaspati, forwards!' he says, because Brihaspati is the Brahman of the gods,--thus he announces it to him who is the Brahman of the gods: therefore he says, 'O Brihaspati, forwards !'

Therewith he hastes to Savitri for his impulsion, for he is the impeller of the gods; and 'acceptable to Mitra and Varuna' he says, because Mitra and Varuna are the deities of the Maitrâvaruna (Prasâstri),--thus he announces it to those who are the deities of the Maitrâvaruna: therefore he says, 'acceptable to Mitra and Varuna.'
trayī vai vidyā /	Threefold, forsooth, is science; the Riks, the Yagus, and the Sâmans.

And the Yagus, forsooth, are the air, and the Sâmans the sky. That same threefold science is used in the Soma-sacrifice.

Therefore whosoever has learnt one of these sciences, let him endeavour to learn also what is contained in the two others: by the Rik, forsooth, he conquers this world, by the Yagus the air, and by the Sâman the sky.

Therefore in the Sadas they perform (the Sastras and Stotras) with the Rik and Sâman, for the Sadas is Indra's own.
athaitaṃ viṣṇuṃ yajñam / etairyajurbhiḥ pura ivaiva bibhrati tasmātpuraścaraṇaṃ nāma //	And by means of these Yagus they, as it were, bring forward (puras) that Vishnu, the sacrifice: hence the name 'puraskarana' (preparatory ceremony).

She said, 'What will be my reward then?'--'Whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svâhâ, and without Vashat, that shall be thine!' Hence whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svâhâ, and without Vashat, that belongs to Speech. She then went forward and made that known, saying, 'Do this so! do this so!'
tasmādu kurvantyevarcā havirdhāne / prātaranuvākamanvāha sāmidhenīranvāha grāvṇo 'bhiṣṭautyevaṃ hi sayujāvabhavatām //	Therefore they also perform with the Rik in the Havirdhâna: he (the Hotri) recites the morning prayer, he recites the kindling-verses; he (the Grâvastut) praises the pressing-stones,--for thus, indeed, they (Speech and Mind) became yoke-fellows.
tasmādu kurvantyeva sadasi / yajuṣṭaudumbarīmucrayanti sadaḥ saminvanti dhiṣṇyānupakirantyevaṃ hi sayujāvabhavatām //	And hence they also perform with the Yagus in the Sadas: they raise up the Udumbara post, they erect the Sadas, they throw up the dhishnya hearths,--for thus they became yoke-fellows.

Therefore to any one looking into the Sadas, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may look) through the door, for the door is made by the gods.

Therefore to any one looking into the Havirdhâna, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on.

From that generation Indra was produced: from fire, indeed, fire is produced, viz. Indra from the Rik and the Sâman; for Indra they call him that burns yonder (the sun).

Hence he thereby produces the sacrificer, and for him he produces food: from the Rik and Sâman he produces the sacrificer, and from water and Soma he produces food for him.
yajuṣā ha vai devāḥ / agre yajñaṃ tenire 'tharcātha sāmnā tadidamapyetarhi yajuṣaivāgre yajñaṃ tanvate 'tharcātha sāmnā yajo ha vai nāmaitadyadyajuriti //	Now with the Yagus the gods first performed sacrifice, then with the Rik, then with the Sâman and in like manner do they now perform the sacrifice. first with the Yagus, then with the Rik, then with the Sâman; for Yagus, they say, is the same as Yagas (worship).

It became, as it were, emptied the most; it was not equal to the other two sciences,--the air-world was not equal to the two other worlds.

Therefore the Yagus, while being distinct, are yet indistinct; and therefore the air-world, while being distinct, is yet indistinct (indefinable).
āpyāyayatyevaināni sa tānyenamāpīnānyāpyāyayantyatha ya uccaiścarati rūkṣayatyevaināni sa tānyenaṃ rūkṣāṇi rukṣayanti //	He who performs with the Yagus in a low voice, strengthens them; and they, thus strengthened, strengthen him. But he who performs in a loud voice, weakens them, and, being weak, they weaken him.

Hence nothing whatever is done, unless ordered by the Adhvaryu: when the Adhvaryu says, 'Recite (the invitatory prayer)! Pronounce the offering prayer!' then those who perform with the Rik perform it. And when the Adhvaryu says, 'Soma becometh pure: turn ye back !' then those who perform with the Sâman perform it,--for speech speaks not but what is conceived by the mind.
tadvā etanmano 'dhvaryuḥ / pura ivaiva carati tasmātpuraścaraṇaṃ nāma pura iva ha vai śriyā yaśasā bhavati ya evametadveda //	Thus, then, the Adhvaryu, the mind, walks, as it were, in front (puras-karati): hence the name 'puraskarana ;' and verily, he who knows this, stands, as it were, in front through prosperity and glory.
tadvā etadeva puraścaraṇam /	Now that same puraskarana (going before) is nothing else than yonder burning (sun): one ought to perform in accordance with his (the sun's) course.

And when thereafter they perform the sacrifice, then they (under)go; then he, who is the leader, leads: hence they say of them, 'they (under)go .'

That same food, gained by them, wished to go away from them,--and, food being cattle, it was the cattle that wished to go away from them, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may hurt us : how, indeed, will they deal with us?'

Thus it becomes attached to him, and, indeed, whosoever, knowing this, is able to observe the vow thereof, he becomes an eater of food, dear to food.

Each of themsits speechless, strengthening his voice : with that (voice) strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. Then the others are dismissed, either (for) fetching fuel or to their day's reading of the scriptures.

He thereby addresses the cattle; they thereby secure cattle for themselves.

Thus, whatever the nature of his Sâman is, that they come to be who sit through a sacrificial session.

They creep along with an atikhandas verse; for that, the atikhandas (redundant metre), is all the metres;--thus evil does not overtake them: therefore they creep along with an atikhandas verse.

By means of this Sâman they overtook it, and, thus overtaken, it returned to them. Hence upwards on this earth grow the plants, and upwards the trees. And in like manner does the pith of Vâk wish to desert these (sacrificers) who have won it, and tries to creep away along this earth,--for Vâk is this earth: her pith are these plants and trees. By means of this Sâman they overtake it, and, thus overtaken, it returns to them.

For he would cause (the performance) to be in excess were another to chant; he would cause an excess, were another to join in it; he would cause an excess, were another to overhear it: therefore the prelude is performed by (the Udgâtri) himself, and the chant is not joined in.

But this has not been obtained, this has not been acquired by them, namely, the (theological) discussion, the sacred discourse: this is what they thereby obtain, what they acquire.

And previously to this, each of them sits speechless, strengthening his speech , and with their speech thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. But at this (disputation) the entire speech, thus obtained, becomes exhausted: that speech they all strengthen (by remaining) speechless, and with it thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the Atirâtra .
audumbarīmanvārabhyāsate /	They sit touching the Udumbara post , for strength is food, and the Udumbara tree is strength: with strength he thus invigorates speech.

And as to why there is that (cake) for Vaisvânara;--Vaisvânara ('belonging to all men') truly is the year, and Pragâpati is the year; and Pragâpati indeed thereby created abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!' And in like manner does that (king) thereby create abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!'

Then as to why he performs the oblations of the Ratnins: it is their king he becomes; it is for them that he thereby is consecrated, and it is them he makes his own faithful followers.

They offered up for him those (oblations), and he appropriated to himself all the food here on earth. They would even call forest beasts to him, saying, 'Come hither thou (beast) so and so, the king wants to cook thee!' Thus he appropriated all food here on earth; and verily he appropriates to himself all food for whom that knows this those (oblations) are offered.

He (Indra) aimed at him a second time. He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Rik-verses. He aimed at him a third time. 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Sâman-hymns (or tunes).

It was thereto that the breaths resorted (sri): therefore also it is the head (siras). And because the breaths did so resort (sri) thereto, therefore also the breaths (vital airs, and their organs) are elements of excellence (srî). And because they resorted to the whole (system) therefore (this is called) body (sarîra).

And inasmuch as he makes the body larger by one person, by that force the body raises the wings and tail.

The vital air, forsooth, is the 'hita,' and speech is the 'upahita,' for it is on the vital air that this speech is based (upa-hitâ). The vital air, again, is the 'hita,' and the limbs are the 'upahita,' for on the vital air these limbs are indeed based.

The gods said to Agni, 'In thee we will heal this our father Pragâpati.'-- 'Then I will enter into him, when whole,' he said.--'So be it!' they said. Hence, while being Pragâpati, they yet call him Agni.

And because they were produced from what was offered (ishta), therefore they are bricks (ishtakâ). And hence they bake the bricks by means of the fire, for it is oblations they thus make.

It is both with speech and with breath that he builds; for Agni is speech, and Indra is the breath; and the fire (agni) relates to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up. And again, Indra and Agni are all the gods, (for) Agni belongs to all deities: thus as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up.

But, surely, when that deity (Pragâpati) became relaxed (fell asunder), he flowed along this (earth) in the shape of his life-sap; and when the gods restored him (put him together), they gathered him up from this earth: this earth then is that one brick , for Agni is this earth, sinceit is thereof that the whole Agni is built up. Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.

Now surely the first brick of clay is this earth,--whatever made of clay he places on that (altar) that is that one brick. And when he puts thereon the heads of the animal victims , that is the animal-brick. And when he puts on the gold plate and man , when he scatters gold shavings thereon, that is the golden brick. And when he puts on two spoonfuls (of ghee) when he puts on the mortar and pestle , and fire-sticks, that is the wood-brick. And when he puts on a lotus-leaf (petal), a tortoise , sour curds, honey, ghee, and whatever other food he puts on, that is the fifth brick, the food.

Let him not do so, for those bricks doubtless are his (Agni's) limbs, his joints; and it would be just as if he were to put a head on each limb, on each joint. But indeed, the fire which is deposited on the pile, that is the head of all those (bricks).

Having become a bird, he (Agni) shall bear me to the sky!' so say some; but let him not think so; for by assuming that form, the vital airs became Pragâpati ; by assuming that form, Pragâpati created the gods ; by assuming that form, the gods became immortal and what thereby the vital airs, and Pragâpati, and the gods became, that indeed he (the Sacrificer) thereby becomes.

That boy entered into the forms one after another; for one never sees him as a mere boy (kumâra), but one sees those forms of his , for he assumed those forms one after another.

Let him, however, build for a year only, and recite for a year; for the same seed which is laid is brought forth; it then lies changing and growing: hence let him build for a year only, and recite for a year. To him (Agni) when built up (kita) he gives a name: whereby he keeps away evil from him. He calls him by a bright (kitra) name , saying, 'Thou art bright;' for Agni is all bright things.

Even as Agni, when kindled, glares, so their eye glares; even as Agni's smoke rises upwards, so vapour rises from them; even as Agni consumes what is put in him, so they devour; even as Agni's ashes fall down, so do their faeces: they are indeed Agni; I will fit them unto mine own self.' He meant to slaughter them for different deities: the Purusha (man) for Visvakarman, the horse for Varuna, the bull for Indra, the ram for Tvashtri, the he-goat for Agni.

He slaughtered them for the Agnis, as for (his) desire,--to wit, 'for the Agnis,' because many were the forms of Agni he had set his mind upon; and 'for the desire,' because it was with a desire that he slaughtered them.

He cut off the heads and put them on (himself, or the altar). The remaining trunks he then let float on the water , and brought the sacrifice to its completion by means of (the offering of) a he-goat, thinking, 'Lest my sacrifice be pulled to pieces.' After performing that animal sacrifice, Pragâpati saw that he had not yet reached the end of Agni (the fire-altar).

He searched for it; and what (part) of those (bodies) cast into the water had settled therein, that water he gathered; and what (had settled) in this earth, that clay (he gathered) . And having gathered both that clayand water, he made a brick: hence a brick consists of these two, clay and water.

So saying, he baked it by means of the fire, and thereby made it immortal; for the sacrificial food which is baked by fire is indeed immortal (or, ambrosia). Hence they bake the bricks with fire: they thereby make them immortal.

And, moreover, there is this other (consideration).

Hence the (sacrificial) fire is set up with him who possesses cattle; for inasmuch as Agni (was) the same as cattle, therefore Pragâpati (the lord of creatures or generation) became Agni.

Let him not do so: he thus would stray from where the gods have gone, he would stray from the path;--and what would he then gather ? For those same bodies, those layers, he gathers: let him therefore not do so.

The trishtubh verses are in the middle, and the gâyatrî verses on both sides thereof; for this body is in the middle, and the (organs of) the vital airs are on the sides thereof. He pronounces more gâyatrî verses before, and fewer after (thetrishtubh verses); for there are more (organs of the) vital airs in front, and fewer behind.

Were it (offered) to Agni (Vaisvânara), he would cause it (the formula) to be redundant. It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Vaisvânara. The offering and invitatory formulas relate to Agni, for the obtainment of Agni's forms.

But they (who do this) become mortal carcases, for unpropitiated arethose (heads) of theirs. In this way, indeed, they did put them on for Ashâdhi Sausromateya ; but quickly indeed he died after that.

Let him not do so, for whoso knows not both the practice and theory of these (victims), for him let them be passed away. Let him slaughter those very five victims, as far as he may be able to do so; for it was these Pragâpati was the first to slaughter, and Syâparna Sâyakâyana the last; and in the interval also people used to slaughter them. But nowadays only these two are slaughtered, the one for Pragâpati, and the one for Vâyu. The theory of these two is now (to be) told.

The animal cake belongs to Pragâpati, for the relation of the victim is also that of the animal cake . It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Pragâpati. The offering and invitatory formulas contain the word 'Ka,' for Pragâpati is Ka .

And when he slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar). It is a white one, because seed is white. It is hornless, because seed is hornless. It belongs to Vâyu, because Vâyu (the wind) is the out-breathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams (niyut ) are the in-breathing: the out-breathing and in-breathing he thus lays into him.

It belongs to Vâyu, because Vâyu is the out-breathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams are the in-breathing: he thus puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into him.

But in that the victim belongs to Vâyu, and the animal cake to Pragâpati, thereby he puts together (restores) him, Pragâpati, wholly and entirely.

And as to why it belongs to Pragâpati, it is because the body (self) is Pragâpati; and (why it is) one on twelve potsherds,--twelve months are a year, and Pragâpati is the year. One of the offering prayers and one of the invitatory prayers contain (the word) 'ka,' for Pragâpati is Ka.

And when they proceed with that (cake) in the middle, it is because this trunk is in the middle. And when they proceed thereafter with the (meat) oblation, he thereby puts into him that vital air which is behind.

Thus when he slaughters this one, thereby indeed all those (five) animals are slaughtered for him. Whichever of these may suit him--either those five animals, or that (he-goat) for Pragâpati, or that one for (Vâyu) Niyutvat --

And, again, why at full moon;--the full moon nodoubt was the first to shine forth, hence also (the sacrifice takes place) at full moon.

yadvevāṣṭakāyām / parvaitatsavatsarasya yadaṣṭakā parvaitadagneryadukhā parvaṇyeva tatparva karoti //	And as to why (it is performed) on the eighth day;--that eighth day no doubt is a joint of the year, and that fire-pan is a joint of Agni (the fire-altar): he thus makes joint upon joint.

And if, after making more spaces , he were not to fill up bricks in accordance therewith, the spaces would exceed the bricks. And when, after initiating himself at new moon, he buys (Soma) at new moon , he piles up as many bricks as he (during the interval) makes space for; and when his (Agni's second) wing is covered (with loose soil), the whole Agni is built up.

Well, when he buys (Soma) at new moon, after becoming initiated at new moon (a year previously), then he piles up just as many bricks as (during that interval) he makes space for; and what days there then are after the buying (of Soma), during that interval the Adhvaryu builds up the fire-altar. But when should he build up, if there were not that interval? As many as there are days and nights in the year, so many are the bricks of that fire-altar. Thereto (comes) a thirteenth month, for there is that thirteenth month;--thus during the days there are after the buying (of Soma), those spaces of it (the altar) are filled up afterwards with those bricks of the thirteenth month: thus the spaces and the bricks become equal.

Let him nevertheless complete (the sacrifice): Pragâpati, having offered that animal, saw that he had not reached the end of him, Agni,--let him therefore complete (the sacrifice). And, again, why he completes it;--that animal sacrifice is his vital air, and if anything were to cut him off from that, it would cut him off from the vital air; and if anything were to cut him off from the vital air, he would thus die: let him therefore complete (the sacrifice).

But in no way is this a Dîkshâ, for there is neither a girdle, nor a blackantelope skin ; but he makes this the first brick : let him therefore, if he like, sleep upon (a couch); and whatever food animals here eat, all that is here obtained and taken possession of by him; and whatever kinds of food there are other than honey, of all those he may eat at pleasure, if he can get them. Carnal intercourse, however, he may not hold prior to the (offering of) clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna : the purport of this (will be explained) hereafter.

He thereby doubtless meant to say, 'with the cattle-brick;' for that cattle-brick is the same as the dûrvâ-brick : hence the dûrvâ-brick is laid so as not to be separated from the first naturally-perforated one; hence also not separated from this earth are the plants, the cattle, the fire,--for not separated (from the earth) he (Agni) stepped nigh with this (brick).

He thereby doubtless meant to say, 'with the regional (bricks ):' hence on the second naturally-perforated one the regional ones are laid, without being separated from it ; and hence not separated from the air are the regions, the wind; for not separated therefrom he (Vâyu) stepped nigh with this (brick).

They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye how we also may share in this ! Whilst they were meditating, the gods saw a second, the Rishis a fourth, layer .

The gods then said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst they were meditating, Savitri saw those Sâvitra (formulas); and inasmuch as Savitri saw them, they are called Sâvitra.

And the libation is a sacrifice; and inasmuch as he saw it after sacrificing (ishtvâ), it is a brick (ishtakâ).

And inasmuch as by this (libation) he gratifies Savitri, they (the formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation.

And what Vâk (speech) was, that is this offering-spoon; for Vâk is a female, and the offering-spoon (sruk, f.) is a female; and those waters which went forth from the world of Vâk (speech) , they are this (ghee) which he offers (in) this libation.

For it is from a womb that he who is born is born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' so he thinks.

It is, however, a cubit long, for the cubit is the arm, and strength is exerted by the arm: it thus becomes equal to his strength.

But indeed it is one that is sharp on both sides, for on both sides is there a keen edge to this speech of curs, inasmuch as it speaks both what is divine and what is human , and both truth and untruth: therefore it is one that is sharp on both sides.

By means of those deities he thus takes it up, impelled by Savitri; by the Gâyatrî metre: he thus imparts the Gâyatrî metre to it. 'From the Earth's seat, Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya !'--now soil means cattle: thus, 'from the earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!'--'by the Trishtubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!' he thereby takes it with the Trishtubh metre and thus lays into it the Trishtubh metre.

'By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in the seat!' the seat no doubt is this (spot): thus, 'By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in this seat (place).'--'By the Gagatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!' he thus takes it up by means of the Gagatî metre, and lays the Gagatî metre into it.

Having taken it up with three (formulas), he addresses it with a fourth; for the gods having thus taken it with three (formulas), then laid vigour into it by means of a fourth; and in like manner does he now, after taking it up with three (formulas), lay strength into it with the fourth.

Now that monosyllable 'vâk' is the same as this last one, the Anushtubh; and that trisyllable 'aksharam' is the same as those former formulas: he thus digs up Agni by the whole speech, and equips it with the whole speech,--hence with four (formulas).

He takes it up both by metres and by formulas, that makes eight--there are four quarters, and four intermediate quarters: he thus lays speech into all the quarters, whence speech speaks in all the quarters.

And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after offering those two libations, see the fire-pan, these worlds; and those all-light deities.

Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trishtubhs, they are Indra; and Agni (the fire) belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Moreover, Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni (thus) contains all deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed.

They drew that rampart round it; and in like manner does this one now draw that rampart round it,--with the spade, for the spade is the thunderbolt, and he thus makes the thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector. He draws it all round: on every side he thus makes that thunderbolt to be its (or his) protector . Three times he draws a line: that threefold thunderbolt he thus makes to be a protector for him.

Each following (circular) line he makes wider, and with a larger metre: hence each following line of strongholds is wider, for strongholds (ramparts) are lines.

For the sake of protection they made this earth to be a self (body, âtman) for him, thinking, 'His own self will protect his own self.' It (the lump of clay) should be as large as the hole: thus this earth (or clay) becomes his (Agni's) self. And as to its (being) as large as the hole,--this earth is the womb, and this (clay) is teed; and whatever part of the seedexceeds the womb, becomes useless; and what is deficient, is unsuccessful; but that part of the seed which is within the hole is successful. Four-cornered is this hole, for there are four quarters: from all the (four) quarters he thus digs him.

That (skin) he spreads silently; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice; and the sacrifice is Pragâpati, and undefined is Pragâpati.

These (verses) consist of nine feet, for there are nine vital airs, seven in the head, and two downward ones: these he thus lays into him.

And what comes to be like the year, comes to be like the Brihatî; for the year is the Brihatî,--twelve full moons, twelve eighth days (of the fortnight of waning moon), twelve new moons, that makes thirty-six, and the Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables. He takes it (the lump of clay) from the right (south) to the left (north) side (of the hole), for from the right side seed is infused into the womb; and this (hole) now is his (Agni's) womb.

He joins together this and this quarter , whence these two quarters are joinedtogether; then this one and this one, whence these two also are joined together: first thus, then thus; then thus, then thus. This is moving (from left) to right, for so (it goes) to the gods: with this and this one a means of healing is prepared; with this and this one he heals.

'Upright for our protection, stand thou like the god Savitri!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'upright, as a bestower of strength,'--for standing upright he (the sun) indeed bestows strength, food;--'when we utter our call with the shining offerers'--the shining offerers , doubtless, are his (the sun's) rays: it is these he means. He lifts it up beyond the reach of his arms, for beyond the reach of his arms is that (sun) from here.

He thereby lays vigour into the he-goat.

He thus mentions the ass in the formula of the horse, and thereby imbues the ass with sorrow ;--'bearing Agni Purîshya, may henot perish before his full measure of time!'--that is, 'bearing Agni favourable to cattle, may he (the horse) not perish before (the completion of) this sacred work.' He thereby equips him (Agni) with the horse.

Now, in going away from this (Âhavanîya ), the horse goes first, then the ass, then the he-goat,--for the horse corresponds to the Kshatra (nobility), the ass to the Vaisya and Sûdra, the he-goat to the Brâhmana.

And inasmuch as the ass does not go first, either in going from here, or in coming back from there, therefore the Brâhmana and Kshatriya never go behind the Vaisya and Sûdra hence they walk thus in order to avoid a confusion between good and bad. And, moreover, he thus encloses those two castes (the Vaisya and Sûdra) on both sides by the priesthood and the nobility, and makes them submissive.

And, moreover, the he-goat is the Brahman (priesthood): with the Brahman he thus equips him.

He takes it down from the right (south) to the left (north) side: the significance of this has been explained. Raised and sprinkled is (the place) where he takes it down, for on a (mound), raised and sprinkled, the (sacrificial) fire is laid down.

They enclosed him with this stronghold; and in like manner does this one now enclose him with this stronghold. And, again, this is a womb;and this (clay) is seed; and in secret, as it were, the seed is infused into the womb: it is thus made of the form of the womb; and hence it is only in secret that one would have intercourse even with his own wife.

To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever deity a Yagus formula applies, that Rik-verse is that very deity, and that Yagus formula is that very deity: hence this triplet is these waters, and they are those very waters which appeared as one form : that form he now makes it.

And the clay he now mixes is that very clay which was created as the third form. It was from these forms that he (Agni) was created at the beginning, and from them he now produces him.

And as to why with goat's hair, it is because in the he-goat (is contained) the form of all cattle; and as to its being hair, form is hair .

He therewith fashions it without restriction (to any part of the pan), for unrestricted are the quarters.

But, indeed, an arrow formerly used to be five spans long .

Let him not do so; for that first bottom part is this world; and that first (lower) side-part is the air; and the upper one is the sky; and that fourth, the prayer, doubtless is the quarters; and just as much as these worlds and the quarters are, so much is this whole (universe). But were he to add anything thereto, he would make it to be redundant, and whatever redundant (act) is done in the sacrifice is left over for the Sacrificer's spiteful rival. And as to the expiation in case of the (fire-pan being) broken, that (will be told) in a subsequent chapter .

She forms it of that same clay, for this earth is (one) of these worlds. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated consort (mahishî) forms it: for this earth is a 'mahishî' (female buffalo, a cow).
pādamātrī bhavati / pratiṣṭhā vai pāda iyamu vai pratiṣṭhā tryālikhitā bhavati trivṛddhīyam //	It measures a foot (in length and breadth), for the foot is a foundation, and this earth also is a foundation. It is marked with three lines, for this earth is threefold .

He makes them from that same clay (as the fire-pan): he thus produces these gods from these worlds. The Sacrificer makes them. They are marked with three lines, for threefold are these gods . Thus as regards the deities.

She makes it from that same clay, for this speech is of the body. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated consort makes it, for speech is a 'mahishî.' It is marked with three lines, for speech is divided into three kinds, Rik-verses, Yagus-formulas, and Sâman-tunes; and because of this threefold form of speech, low-voiced, half-loud, and loud.
athokhāṃ karoti /	He makes the fire-pan: thereby he makes (Agni's) self.

The Sacrificer makes them: the Sacrificer thusproduces offspring from his own self. He makes them without interruption: he thus produces uninterrupted offspring from his own self. He makes them subsequently (to the fire-pan): he thus produces the offspring subsequently to his own self. They are marked with three lines, for generation is threefold, father, mother, and son; or, the embryo, and the inner and outer membrane.

Verily, then, whosoever knowing this does it on this wise, makes up the whole and complete Agni.

And, again, as to why he fumigates,--that fire-pan is the head of the sacrifice, and the smoke its breath: he thus puts breath into the head.

And with dung (he does it) because that is what was eaten (by the horse) and is useless; and thus he does not injure the horse itself, nor the other cattle.

But also what is many times, seven times seven, is (expressed by) seven : he thus puts the seven vital airs into the head.

They made this (earth) to be his self (body), for protection, thinking, 'The self will protect itself.'

That bamboo spade now disappears. This hole is four-cornered, for there are four quarters: he thus digs it from all the quarters . Having then laid down fuel in it, he silently puts the 'invincible' (brick) thereon, for that is made first.

But, surely, these are the plants,--the wives of the gods are indeed the plants; for by the plants everything here is supported: by means of the plants he thus supports this (fire-pan).

But, surely, this is Vâk (speech),--the Dhishanâs are indeed speech , for by speech everything is kindled here: by means of speech he thus kindles this (fire-pan).

But, surely, these are the metres,--the ladies (gnâ) are indeed the metres (scripture texts), for by means of these men go (gam) to the celestial world: by means of the metres he thus bakes it.

The other, the pap, has many deities, for the pap is a multiplicity of rite-grains, and those Âdityas are a multiplicity of gods: he thus bestows multiplicity on the people. Thus much as to the deities.

Seven (libations) of the fire,--the fire(-altar) consists of seven layers ; seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Those two kinds (of libations) amount to twelve,--twelve months are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

Let him not do so; for the fire which is kindled (in the fire-pan) is the essence of the completed sacrifice and of those libations, and when he puts the fire-pan on the fire, after the sacrifice has been completed and the Audgrabhanas offered, then the sacrifice mounts it (the pan), and it bears the sacrifice: let him, therefore, put the fire-pan on the fire only after the sacrifice is complete, and the Audgrabhanas have been offered.

But let him not do so; for the animal is indeed born with bones ; but it is not forced in with bones, as it were, at first; but it is introduced only as seed.

The hemp is outside, and the ghee is inside; for the outer membrane is outside, and the inner membrane is inside. The ghee is outside, and the kindling-stick is inside; for the inner membrane is outside, and the embryo is inside. It is from these that he who is born is born, and from them he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.

That vikaṅkata, then, is that first offering; it is that he now offers on this (fire), and he therewith gratifies him (Agni).

Accordingly they laid into the udumbara tree what pith and essence there was in those trees; and on account of that pith it matures (fruit) equal to all the (other) trees : hence that (tree) is always moist, always full of milky sap,--that udumbara tree, indeed, (being) all the trees, is all food: he thus gratifies him (Agni) by every kind of food, and kindles him by all trees (kinds of wood).

Now that (wood) not cut by an axe is one kind of food (for the fire): it is thereby that he now gratifies him. 'Whatsoever wood we lay upon thee, O Agni, let all that be ghee unto thee, do thou relish that, O youngest!' as the text, so its meaning: whatever (wood there is) not cut by the axe, that he makes palatable to him; and having made it food for him, he sets it before him.

Now that (wood) which has lain on the ground is one kind of food (for the fire): it is thereby he now gratifies him. 'What the red ant eats, what the white ant crawls over,'--for either the red ant eats it, or the white ant crawls over it;--'let all that be ghee for thee, do thou relish that, O youngest!' as the text, so its meaning: whatever (wood) has lain on the ground, that he makes palatable for him; and having made it food for him, he sets it before him.

And, again, why they are palâsa ones--;the Palâsa tree is Soma, and he, Soma, doubtless is the supreme offering: it is that he now offers on this (fire), and by that he gratifies him (Agni).

Let him put on both these (kindling-sticks); for both the Brahman and the Kshatra are this Agni; and it is this Agni he thus kindles by those two, by the Brahman and the Kshatra.

But the food which is proportionate to one's body satisfies, and does no injury; but what is too much that does injury, and what is too little that does not satisfy. Standing he puts them on--the significance of this (will be explained)further on;--and with the Svâhâ ('hail!'); for seed is infused here (in the sacrifice,--to wit,) this Agni; and were he to put on the logs unconsecrated by Svâhâ, he would injure him (Agni). Now inasmuch as they are kindling-sticks, they are not oblations; but inasmuch as (they are put on) with the Svâhâ, they are food, for the Svâhâ is food; and thus he does not injure him (Agni).

He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him , thus freed from foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,--and thereby regales him with food for the night,--with, 'Night for night bearing unremittingly '--the meaning of this has been told: he prays for that same security and wellbeing for the night; and whatsoever he puts on 'thereafter by night, that he puts on as a libation offered to him .

Some, however, say, 'Let him not dip it into the fast-milk: he would be offering a libation, and it would be improper were one who is initiated to offer a libation.'

Into that (pot) he first throws a potsherd of the (broken) pan, and thus he (Agni) is not deprived of that womb of his.

Having then taken it out of the Gârhapatya eastwards (to the place of the Âhavanîya), and put fuel on it, let himput the fire-pan on it in the same way (as before), without using any formula, quite silently. When the fire rises up to it,--

He performs both expiations, that of the (Soma) sacrifice and that of the fire-altar,--first that of the sacrifice, then that of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained .

Then stepping near he puts the kindling-stick on the fire, with , 'Again the Âdityas, the Rudras, the Vasus may kindle thee, again the Brahmans with sacrifices, O bringer of good things!'--that is, 'May those deities again kindle thee!'--'With ghee make thou grow thy body, let the wishes of the Sacrificer be true!'--that is, 'With ghee indeed make thou grow thy body, and for whatever wishes the Sacrificer makes up a fire, may they all come true!'

Having taken it straightwayeastward from the Gârhapatya, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations: whatever (kind of Soma) sacrifice may be (performed) at the time, the expiation of that sacrifice he should perform; and of like kind is the expiation of the fire-altar.

Having taken it from the Gârhapatya eastward along the north of the Sadas, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations. And if the Gârhapatya were to go out, the meaning (procedure) of that has been explained.

It (the plate) is round, for he (the sun) is round. It has twenty-one knobs, for he is the twenty-first . He wears it with the knobs outside, for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays arc outside.

They made that (plate), yonder sun, to be his (Agni's) protector (standing) by his side, for the gold plate is yonder sun: and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now make that (plate) to be his (Agni's) protector by his side.

He does so with a verse to Varuna: he thus frees himself from Varuna's noose by its own self, by its own deity. 'Take off from us, O Varuna, the uppermost cord, down (take) the lowest, away the middle one!'--as the text, so the meaning;--'and so, O Âditya, may we be sinless in thy service for safety (Aditi)!'--Aditi is this earth: thus, 'Sinless may we belong to thee and to her (the earth)!'

Now were that alone to take place, he (the sun), surely, would stop even there (in the north); but inasmuch as he now holds him up thus (towards south-east), he (the sun) having gone thus (in a northerly direction), then comes back again thus (in a southerly direction).

Well, on that (first) occasion, when he is being initiated, he, at the outset, combines both (performances) in the afternoon; for the afternoon is the same thing as the night. Then throwing them thus together, he at the end combines them both in the forenoon; for the forenoon is the same thing as the day; and in this way they are both performed during the day, and both during the night.

Let him not conclude by performing the Vishnu-strides, for that would be as ifafter going for a drive he were not to unyoke; but when he concludes by performing the Vâtsapra--the Vâtsapra being a halting-place--(it is) as if he made a halt and unloosed (the team): let him therefore conclude by performing the Vâtsapra.

Let him not think this to be so; for divine (to the gods) is that progress of his, to wit, the Vishnu-strides; and divine the unyoking, to wit, the Vâtsapra. But human would be that progress of his, which he makes in this manner, and human the unyoking he makes.

From the south he places him (Agni) northwardson (the chariot)--the significance of this has been explained. Having put the Gârhapatya into a pot, he places it on (the chariot) behind (the Âhavanîya, or Ukhya Agni). If he choose, he himself may mount up beside him (Agni), or he may walk by the side (of the chariot).

It was Agni indeed whom the gods thereby praised and magnified; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby praise and magnify him: 'Agni roared like the thundering sky,'--the meaning of this has been explained .

With a (verse) containing (the verb) 'sthâ' (he performs), for he thereby makes him stop (sthâ) for (staying at) his home.

'Off with you! away with you! crawl away from here !'--that is, 'Go off, go away, and crawl away from here!' he says this to those that crawl on their belly;--'Ye that are here of old and of late!' that is, 'both ye who were here of yore, and ye of the present day.'

He desired, 'May they agree together!' He made them to be of the same (kind of) amnion: hence even to this day, being of equal amnions, they agree together. And he who offers, offers thinking, 'May I be (born) with the same (kind of) amnion as the gods!' and when he scatters saline salt (in the hearth-site) he thereby becomes of equal amnion with the gods.

Agni's soil thou art!' for Agni's ashes are useless, and the sand is not useless: he thus makes it (the Gârhapatya hearth) to be useful. He covers with it the whole Gârhapatya; for the Gârhapatya altar is the womb, and the sand is seed: he thus fills the whole womb with seed.
yonirvai pariśrita idamevaitadretaḥ siktaṃ yonyā parigṛhṇāti tasmādyonyā retaḥ siktam parigṛhyate //	He then encloses it with enclosing-stones; for the enclosing-stones are the womb: he thus encloses the seed here cast in the womb; and hence the seed which is cast is enclosed in the womb.

(He puts up the stones) by turning to the right (or south) , whence the ocean flows round this world (from the east) southwards;--by means of a dug out (hole, or moat) , whence the ocean flows round this world in a moat.

He does not settle them, for unsettled are the waters; nor does he pronounce the Sûdadohas (verse) on them .

With one and the same formula he lays down many bricks , for of one and the same form are the waters; and as to there being many enclosing-stones, it is because there are many waters.

The enclosing-stones are outside, and the saline earth is inside; for the womb is outside, and the amnion inside. The saline earth is outside, and the sand inside; for the amnion is outside, and the seed inside. He who is born is born from these: it is from them that he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.

Now the four which he puts on running eastwards are the body; and as to there being four of these, it is because this body (of ours) consists, of four parts . The two at the back then are the thighs; and the two in front the arms; and where the body is that (includes) the head.

He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes the self one. He pronounces the Sûdadohas verse on them; for the Sûdadohas is the vital air: by means of the vital air he thus makes him (Agni) continuous, joins him together.

There are two of them, for there are two thighs. Behind he puts them on, for behind are those thighs. At their upper ends they are joined (to the central ones ), for so are these thighs joined (to the body) at their upper ends.

Five times he 'settles' (the bricks)--the fire-altar consists of five layers; five seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,so great he thus builds him. Eight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes thirteen,--thirteen months are a year, and there are thirteen layers of earth in the fire-altar: as great as Agni is, as great .as is his measure, so great does this become.

And inasmuch as he puts on those (bricks) in this way, he thereby establishes those two (the sun and the fire) in each other, and (accordingly) those two are established in each other; for both of them he now makes out to be the twenty-first, and bothof them are then here , as the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya.

It (the Gârhapatya altar) should be even with the mouth (of the fire-pan): the significance of this has been told .

It is circular, for the womb is circular; and moreover the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and this world doubtless is circular.

Injure ye not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice, and be ye propitious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He therewith pacifies them for (mutual) safety, so that they shall do no injury to one another.

Now when yoked there, it (the fire-pan) bore this Agni within it as seed, and him it has now brought forth. It now conceives a second time; for the 'Ukhâ' is a female, and hence when a female has brought forth the seed the first time, it conceives a second time.

He then pours milk into it,--it first receives seed, and now it receives milk; for the fire-pan is a female: hence when a female receives seed, then it receives milk. The sand is below, and the milk above, for the seed is below, and the milk above. He pours it into the middle, so that thereon he may place the human head .

From him, when relaxed, the vital air went out from within: then his vigour went out of him. That having gone out, he fell down. From him, thus fallen, food flowed forth: it was from that eye on which he lay that his food flowed. And, verily, there teas then no firm foundation whatever here.

He said, 'So be it!' Therefore the gods eat food with Agni as their mouth; for to whatsoever deity men offer, it is into Agni that they offer, since it is with Agni for their mouth that the gods thus took in the food.

And the air is his body, and what wind there is in the air, that is that vital air of his in the body. And the sky is his head; the sun and the moon are his eyes. The eye on which he lay is the moon: whence that one is much closed up, for the food flowed therefrom.

And when the fire rises over it thus heated, then that same vital air which went out from within him comes back to him, and he puts it into him. And when, putting on the gold plate, he wears it, he puts into him that very vigour which had gone out of him. And when he puts on kindling-sticks, he puts into him that very food which had flowed from him.

And in whatever part of this (year) he should therefore not do so, into that part of him (Pragâpati) he would not put that (which belongs therein). 'One must not even be a looker-on at the (building up of a fire) not carried about for a year,' Vâmakakshâyana was wont to say, 'lest he should see this our father Pragâpati being torn to pieces .' He restores him so as to be whole and complete, and raises him to stand upright, even as the gods then raised him.

And what space there is between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya, that is the air ; and that wind inthe air is for him the fire on the Âgnîdhrîya. The sky is his Âhavanîya (hearth), and those two, the sun and the moon, are the fire on the Âhavanîya.

And as to why it (the Âhavanîya) has wings and tail, it is because that vital air in the head has wings and tail ;--the eye is its head, the right ear its right wing, the left ear its left wing, the vital air its central body , and the voice is the tail (and) the foundation (the feet): inasmuch as the vital airs subsist by eating food with speech (voice) , the voice is the tail, the foundation.

Let him not do so: they who do so do what is excessive,--one amounting to twenty-one, one amounting to the Anushtubh, and one amounting to the Brihatî; for this (altar) is of one single form--awomb. And as to those downward vital airs, they are indeed a bringing forth, for even the urine and faeces he voids are 'brought forth.'

From it they take one of the two (first) anushtubhs of thirty-two syllables (to be) the Âhavanîya,--that Âhavanîya is that sky, that head (of Pragâpati). Then one of the two (anushtubhs) is left here (to be) this Gârhapatya, this foundation, this very (terrestrial) world.

And because there are two of them (making up one anushtubh), therefore that space (and hearth) between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya (viz. the Âgnîdhrîya hearth ) is smaller; and therefore the air-world is the smallest of these worlds.

And verily he who knows this makes up for himself the whole Vâk (speech), the whole vital air, the whole body (of Pragâpati).

The Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables,--it is the Brihatî that that (Âhavanîya) pile thus amounts to; for whatlike the seed which is infused into the womb, suchlike (offspring) is born therefrom: thus in that he makes up that Brihatî (metre) in this (Gârhapatya hearth), thereby that (Âhavanîya) fire-altar amounts to the Brihatî.

Well, at first these two worlds (heaven and earth) were together; and when they parted asunder, the space which was between (antar) them became that air (antariksha); for 'îksha ' indeed it was theretofore, and 'Now this ""îksha"" has come between (antarâ),' they said, whence 'antariksha' (air). And as to why, after building the Gârhapatya, he builds the Âhavanîya, it is because these two worlds were created first. Then, going back, he throws up the Dhishnya hearths, just to prevent discontinuity ofthe sacred work; and thus indeed the middle is completed, after the two ends have been completed."

And, besides, he removes, by means of these (bricks), whatever evil, whatever corruption there is; and because he removes by them evil, corruption (nirriti), therefore these are Nirriti's (bricks).

In the course of a year they prepared for him this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the Gârhapatya (hearth) being this world: therein they generated him. And whatever evil there was in him, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer membrane, that they removed from him by means of these (bricks); and inasmuch as thereby they removed his evil, his corruption, these are Nirriti's (bricks).

They get baked by (rice) husks, for husks belong to Nirriti: by Nirriti's own (objects) he thus performs Nirriti's rite. They are black, for black was that darkness; and black in truth is Nirriti (corruption).

And anywhere where there is a self-produced hollow or cleft in the ground, he lays down those (bricks); for on whatever part of this (earth) there is a cleaving, or in whatever part of it plants are not produced, verily that part of it Nirriti seizes upon: he thus places corruption in a (part) of the earth set aside for Nirriti.

Now Nirriti is this earth, and this earth makes him decay who becomes corrupted: in speaking thus, it is as if he were to say, 'Thou art So and So, the son of So and So, I know thee, do not injure me!' for in no wise does he who is known injure one when spoken to.

He does not 'settle' them,--settlement being a firm footing--lest he give a firm footing to evil. He does not pronounce the Sûdadohas verse upon them,--the Sûdadohas being the vital air,--lest he should join Nirriti (corruption) together, and restore her.

With Trishtubh verses (he performs this rite), for the Trishtubh is a thunderbolt: it is thus with a thunderbolt that he repels evil, corruption.

They go back (to the sacrificial ground) without looking back: they thus abandon evil, corruption, even without looking back to it.

'And plentiful yield be there through our song!'--the song is speech, and yield means food;--'and let the ripe crop go anigh the sickle!' for when food gets ripe, people approach it with the sickle. With two (verses) he yokes, a Gâyatrî and a Trishtubh one: the significance of this has been explained.

And, indeed, the food which is put into the body benefits the body as well as the wings and tail; but that which (is put) into the wings and tail does not benefit either the body or the wings and tail.

He then lets them loose towards north-east--the significance of this has been explained .

Now the waters which, loathing Vritra, rose up on the dry land forming bushes, became those grasses ,--inasmuch as they rose forming bushes (dribh), they are (called) darbha-grasses. These darbha-grasses, then, are the water (which remained) pure, and meet for sacrifice, when Vritra flowed towards it; and inasmuch as they are darbha-grasses, they are plants: by both kinds of food he thus gratifies him (Agni).

And as far as the life-sap extends, so far extends the body: he thus gratifies him by this universe.

prajāpatireṣo 'gniḥ /	This Agni is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is both the defined and the undefined, the limited and theunlimited.

The outer forms are defined, and the inner ones are undefined; and Agni is the same as an animal: hence the outer forms of the animal are defined, and the inner ones undefined.

acita āhavanīye 'tha rājānaṃ krīṇātyātmā vā agnī rasaḥ soma ātmānaṃ tadrasenānuṣajati tasmādayamāntamevātmā rasenānuṣaktaḥ //	And, again, why he buys the king when the Gârhapatya is built, and the Âhavanîya unbuilt,--Agni is the body, and Soma is the life-sap: he thus supplies the body with life-sap, and hence this body (of ours) is supplied with life-sap from end to end.
rājānaṃ krītvā paryuhya /	Having bought the king, and driven him about, he then takes out the material for the guest-meal.

And in this way he interlinks the performanceof the (Soma) sacrifice and the performance of the fire (altar) for the purpose of unity of performance, thinking, 'Uniform shall be this performance!'
ātmā vā agniḥ prāṇo 'dhvara ātmaṃstatprāṇam madhyato dadhāti tasmādayamātmanprāṇo madhyataḥ //	And, again, why he interlinks them,--Agni (the fire-altar) is the body, and the (Soma) sacrifice is the vital air: he thus places the vital air in the midst of the body, and hence that vital air is in the middle of the body.
ātmā vā agnī raso 'dhvara ātmānaṃ tadrasenānuṣajati tasmādayamāntamevātmā rasenānuṣakto 'thāhavanīyasyārdhamaiti //	And, again, why he interlinks them,--Agni is the body, and the (Soma) sacrifice is the vital sap: he thus supplies the body with vital sap, and hence this body is supplied with vital sap from end to end.

ubhayatraiva palāśaśākhayā vyudūhantyubhayatra vai cinotīti na tathā kuryādavasyati vāva gārhapatyenordhva evāhavanīyena rohati tasmāttathā na kuryāt //	Now some sweep with the palâsa branch on both occasions , saying, 'Surely, on both occasions he builds (an altar).' Let him, however, not do so; for by (building) the Gârhapatya he settles, and by the Âhavanîya he rises upwards: therefore let him not do so.
nāhavanīye 'yaṃ vai loko gārhapatyaḥ paśava ūṣā asmiṃstalloke paśūndadhāti tasmādime 'smiṃloke paśavaḥ //	And only on the Gârhapatya (site) he throws saline soil, not on the Âhavanîya; for the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and saline soil means cattle: he thus bestows cattle on this world, whence there are cattle in this world.

On both hescatters sand; for sand means seed, and in both (fire-altars) fashioning (of Agni) takes place: 'May he be fashioned from out of that seed!' thus he thinks.

With the longer formula he scatters it on the Âhavanîya, and with the shorter one on the Gârhapatya, for longer is the life of the gods, and shorter the life of men. On the Gârhapatya he scatters the sand before (the setting up of) the enclosing-stones; for sand is seed: 'May these be fashioned from out of that seed!' thus he thinks.

Well, the saline soil is the amnion, and inasmuch as he strews first the saline soil, that seed of his is not shed aside, but is received by that amnion.
athāhavanīya evāpyānavatībhyāmabhimṛśati /	He now addresses the enclosing-stones on the Âhavanîya: the meaning of this has been explained .

ime vai lokā eṣo 'gnirdiśo logeṣṭakā eṣu tallokeṣu diśo dadhāti tasmādimā eṣu lokeṣu diśaḥ //	He now puts clod-bricks thereon ,--that fire-altar is these worlds, and the clod-bricks are the regions: he thus places the regions into these worlds; whence there are those regions in these worlds.
āptā vā asya tā diśo yā eṣu lokeṣvatha yā imāṃlokānpareṇa diśastā asminnetaddadhāti //	He takes them from outside the (site of the) fire-altar; for those regions which are in these worlds are already possessed by him (Agni); and he now bestows on him those regions which are beyond these worlds.
bahirvederiyaṃ vai vediḥ / āptā vā asya tā diśo yā asyāmatha yā imām pareṇa diśastā asminnetaddadhāti //	From outside the Vedi (he takes them);--the Vedi being this (earth), and those regions which are on this (earth) being already possessed by him, he now bestows on him those regions which are beyond this (earth).

bāhyenāgnimāharati / āpto vā asya sa raso ya eṣu lokeṣvatha ya imāṃlokānparāṅraso 'tyakṣarattamasminnetaddadhāti //	He takes them from outside (the site of) the fire-altar; for the vital sap which is in these worlds is already possessed by him (Agni), and he now putsinto him that vital sap which flowed away beyond these worlds .

sphyenāharati / vajro vai sphyo vīryaṃ vai vajro vittiriyaṃ vīryeṇa vai vittiṃ vindate //	He takes them with the sacrificial (wooden) sword,--the sword is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means force, and this (earth) means wealth: by force he thus obtains wealth.

Ka doubtless is Pragâpati, thus, 'To him let us do homage by offering!' Having brought it he puts it on the body (of the altar-site) inside the enclosing-stones: he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap had flowed away from him in the eastern direction, and also the eastern region itself he bestows upon him.

Having brought it he puts it on the body (of the altar) inside the junction of the (right) wing (and the body): he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap had flowed from him in the southern direction, and also the southern region itself he bestows upon him.

Having brought it he puts it on the body (of the altar) inside the junction of the tail (and the body): he thereby puts into him what vital sap had flowed away from him in the western direction, and also the western region itself he bestows upon him. Let him not take it exactly from the back (west) lest he should take the vital sap from the path of the sacrifice: he takes it from about there .

Having brought that (clod), he puts it on the body (of the altar) on the middle of the junction of the (left) wing (and the body): he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap flowed away in the northerly direction; and also the northern region itself he bestows upon him.

He places them separately, 'settles ' them separately, and separately pronounces the Sûdadohas upon them; for separate from each other are the regions. Standing he places them, for the regions, as it were, stand; and stronger, indeed, one is whilst standing.
tā etā yajuṣmatya iṣṭakāḥ / tā ātmannaivopadadhāti na pakṣapuceṣvātmanhyeva yajuṣmatya iṣṭakā upadhīyante na pakṣapuceṣu //	These same (clods) are bricks having special prayers (yagushmatî ): on the body (of the altar) he places them, not on the wings and tail; for bricks having special prayers are placed on the body, not on the wings or tail.

Well, these (clods) are vital sap, and the vital sap (blood) is naturally-heated; and, moreover, whatever comes in contact with Agni Vaisvânara, even thereby comes to be put on as baked, as heated.

He makes it either a yoke long on each side, or forty feet,--whichever way he pleases.

He covers the whole body (of the altar) with that (sand): he thus puts seed into the whole body ; whence the seed is produced from the whole body.

Well, the metres are vital sap, and vital sap is moist; and inasmuch as he scatters that (sand) with metres, it is thus that it becomes moist for him, after the manner of seed.

Well, endless are the days and nights, and endless is the sand: it is thus that, put on by the days and nights, it becomes complete for him, neither deficient, nor superabundant. 'And wherefrom (is obtained) the oceanic (Samudriya ) metre?' The ocean is endless, and the sand is endless: that is the oceanic metre.

Now that sand is (put) in (the place of) the lost part of the Brahman; and that part of it which has not been lost is this fire-altar which is now being built: thus when he scatters sand he restores to him that lost part of the Brahman. That (sand which) he scatters is unnumbered, unlimited; for who knows how great is that lost part of the Brahman? And verily he who, knowing this, scatters sand, restores the whole, complete Pragâpati.

Let him say, 'Two;' for there are two kinds of sand, the white and the black; or let him say, 'Seven hundred and twenty,' for so many days and nights there are in the year; or 'Two hundred and fifty-two,' for so many syllables there are in that hymn of six verses; or 'Twenty-five,' for seed is twenty-fivefold .

He does not 'settle' it, lest he should stop the seed, and generation.

But, indeed, were it to come forth without breath it would become putrid; and this indeed is the Sûdadohas in this case; for Soma is breath, and the Sûdadohas is breath.

With two (verses) he makes him grow, a gâyatrî and a trishtubh one,--the significance of this has been explained.

With ghee (he bastes it), for sacrificial food is basted with ghee; silently (he does so), for silently sacrificial food is basted;--by means of stalks of Kusa grass, for these are pure, and sacrificially clean;--by means of the tops, for the top is sacred to the gods.

Inasmuch as in this (layer) he (symbolically) sprinkles the bricks of all the layers; andthus indeed that whole fire-altar of his comes to be sprinkled, and led forward on the skin, and led forward by the horse.

For at that time when the gods were setting out to spread the sacrifice, the Rakshas, the fiends, sought to smite them, saying, 'Ye shall not sacrifice! ye shall not spread the sacrifice!!' Having made those fires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, they hurled these at them, and laid them low thereby; and having laid them low, they spread that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.

And so, having made those fires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, he hurls them at whatever Rakshas, whatever evildoers there may be, and lays them low thereby; and having laid them low, he spreads the sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.

These (three), with the (first and last verses) recited thrice, amount to seven,--of seven layers consists the fire-altar , seven seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. He recites in a low voice, for here in the sacrifice seed is (cast), and seed is cast silently.

They saw that thunderbolt, even yonder sun; for that horse is yonder sun: having driven off the Rakshas, the fiends, in front, by that thunderbolt, they obtained well-being in a place free from danger and devilry. They arrive at the (site of) the fire-altar; south of the tail (of the altar) they set down the layer (of bricks); from the north they make the horse step (on the site of the altar).

Having thus warded off the Rakshas, the fiends, from all the regions, he sets it (the horse) free towards northeast: the significance of this has been explained.

And hence, by Pragâpati's power, every one now thinks, 'I am!' And as to why he makes it smell while going westward, it is because, whilst going (from east) to west, that (sun) kisses all these creatures.

And as to that thread, the significance of that (will be explained) further on.

The gods said to Pragâpati, 'Go thou in search of him: to thee, his own father, he will reveal himself.' He became a white horse, and went in search of him. He found him on a lotus leaf, having crept forth from the water. He eyed him, and he (Agni) scorched him: hence the white horse has, as it were, a scorched mouth , and indeed is apt to become weak-eyed. He (Agni) thought he had hit and hurt him, and said to him, 'I grant thee a boon!'

And, accordingly, he who seeks him (Agni) in that form, finds him; and having found him, he then builds him up.

If he cannot obtain a white one, one that is not white might do; but a horse it should be. If he cannot obtain a horse, even an ox might do, for the ox is of Agni's nature, and Agni is the repeller of all evils.

Let him mount it only by the middle body ; for the animal which people mount by the (middle) body, carries them forward, and does not hurt them. From the left (north) side (he should mount it), for any animal which people mount they mount from the left side. By mounting the (body of the) altar from the left side, and performing the work connected with the Uttara-vedi, he takes hold of Agni in the (middle) body (or, into himself); and having taken Agni into his own self, he sings the 'true hymn.' He puts a lotus-leaf on (the altar): thereof further on.

They made that thunderbolt, to wit, yonder sun, his protector, for that horse is yonder sun; and in like manner does this one now make that thunderbolt his (Agni's) protector.

He leads it about on every side: on every side he thus makes that thunderbolt his protector. Thrice he leads it about: he thus makes that thunderbolt his (Agni's) threefold protector.

Now were he to build up Agni without taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal from mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but when he builds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes Agni to be born from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.

Having taken Agniinto his own self whilst standing, he builds him up sitting;--Agni is an animal: hence the animal, having received the foetus standing, gives birth after lying down.
atha satyaṃ sāma gāyati /	He now sings the Satya Sâman (true hymn).
etadvai devā abruvantsatyamasya mukhaṃ karavāma te satyam bhaviṣyāmaḥ satyaṃ no 'nuvartsyati satyo naḥ sa kāmo bhaviṣyati yatkāmā etatkariṣyāmaha iti //	For the gods then said, 'Let us make the truth (satya) his mouth (or beginning): thus we shall become the truth, truth will turn unto us, and true will become that wish of ours for which we are about to perform this rite!'
tadasya satyam mukhamakurvaṃste satyamabhavantsatyamenānanvavartata satya eṣāṃ sa kāmo 'bhavadyatkāmā etadakurvata //	They sang that 'true hymn' at the outset, and thus made the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and they became the truth; the truth turned unto them, and true became that wish of theirs for which they performed this rite.
yatsatyaṃ sāma purastādgāyati tadasya satyam mukhaṃ karoti sa satyam bhavati satyamenamanuvartate satyo 'sya sa kāmo bhavati yatkāma etatkurute //	And in like manner when the Sacrificer now, at the outset, sings the 'true hymn,' he thereby makes the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and he (himself) becomes the truth; and truth turns unto him; and true becomes that wish of his for which he performs this rite.

It is the waters indeed that were made first of this universe: hence when the waters (rains) flow, then everything whatsoever exists is produced here.
atha puṣkaraparṇamupadadhāti / yonirvai puṣkaraparṇaṃ yonimevaitadupadadhāti //	He then puts down a lotus-leaf (in the centre ofthe altar-site);--the lotus-leaf is a womb: he hereby puts a womb to it (for Agni to be born from).

Now this same earth is Agni's womb, for Agni (the fire-altar) is this earth, since thereof the whole Agni is built up: it is this earth he thus lays down. He lays it down so as not to be separated from the truth: he thereby establishes this earth on the truth;--hence this earth is established on the truth; and hence the truth is this earth, for this earth is the most certain of these worlds.

He lays it down with a Svarâg verse, for self-rule (svârâgya) belongs to the waters. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

It is golden, and round, with one and twenty knobs,--the significance of this has been explained. He puts it down with the knobs pointing downward; for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays (shine) downwards.

Now by means of his rays that (sun) is settled on this earth: he thus settles him (Agni) on this earth, as his foundation.

He said to them, 'I am afraid: make ye a stronghold for me!' Now what essence of the waters there was that they gathered upwards (on the surface), and made it a stronghold for him; and because they made (kar) a stronghold (pûh) for him, therefore it is 'pûshkara;' 'pûshkara' being what is mystically called 'push-kara' (lotus-leaf), for the gods love the mystic. Now when he puts it (the gold plate) on the lotus-leaf, he then establishes him (Agni) in that essence which the waters gathered together for him (Indra), and in that stronghold which they made for him.

He puts it on with a trishtubh verse, for yonder (sun) is related to the Trishtubh . Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas verse upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

He is made of gold, for gold is light, and fire is light; gold is immortality, and fire is immortality. It is a man (purusha), for Pragâpati is the Man.

When the gods restored him, they put that pleasing form into him, and the gods were pleased with that (form) of his; and inasmuch as the gods were pleased (ram) with that pleasing (ramya) form of his, it is called 'hiramya;' 'hiramya' being what is mystically called 'hiranya' (gold), for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put that pleasing form into him (Agni), and the gods are pleased with that (form) of his. But that pleasing form of his is the vital air: it is that vital air he thus puts into him.

They laid down the one so as to look hitherwards, and the other so as to look away from here: that one (the sun), the gold disk, looking downwards, gives warmth by his rays, andthat man (tends) upward by his vital airs .

After he has laid him down, let him not walk round him in front, lest that Agni should injure him.

And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanâma formulas, stop these worlds for him, and cause these worlds to bend themselves; and so they do not glide away with that self of his.

He does so by 'homage, homage,' for homage is sacrifice (worship): by sacrifice, by homage, he thus worships them. Let him therefore not say 'homage be to thee,' to one not worthy of sacrifice, for itwould be just as if he said 'sacrifice (or, worship) be to thee!'

And as to why offering-spoons (are laid down), it is because the arms are offering-spoons,--that bowl and the handle are two, for there are two of these arms. He lays them down at the (left and right) sides, for these arms (of ours) are at the sides.

They saw that Rakshas-killing tree, the Kârshmarya: having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, they spread that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. And in like manner the Sacrificer, having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, now spreads that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. It (the spoon) is filled with ghee;--the ghee is a thunderbolt: it is by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south.

And as to its being a verse addressed to Agni, it is because it is the performance of Agni (the fire-altar);--and a trishtubh one, because Indra is connected with the Trishtubh; and Agni includes Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down.

Let him not do so, but let him lay them with the bowl towards the front (east), for this Agni (altar) is built with the head towards the front; and, besides, in this way the arms are stronger.

Let him nevertheless make (him with arms), for those two spoons are (merely) after the manner of the two arms. Moreover, those two (arms of Agni) are wings; and whatever forms, whatever stomas, whatever prishthas, whatever metres he will be applying to that fire-altar, that will be the perfection, that will be the growth of those two: let him therefore make arms to that (gold) man.

He puts it on so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one means food, and the naturally-perforated one means this earth, and this earth is food, since it is on her that all food ripens: he thus places food close to him (the man, Agni).

He puts it so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the naturally-perforated one is this earth, and this earth is the breath, since this earth bears everything that breathes: he thus puts the breath so as not to be separate from him. Upon (the man he places the brick): he thus puts the breath upon him .

He puts it on by means of Pragâpati, for Pragâpati thereby took back to himself (that foundation) of his body.

Having 'settled' it , he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: the meaning of this has been explained.

He lays it down immediately on the naturally-perforated (brick); the naturally-perforated (brick) being this earth, he thus places the cattle immediately on this earth. Upon (the brick he places it): upon this earth he thereby places cattle.

That (dûrvâ grass) is the ruling power (Kshatra), for it is this vital sap, the breath; and the other plants are the hair: in laying down that (dûrvâ plant) he lays down all (kinds of) plants.

He lays it on, with , 'Growing up joint by joint, knot by knot;' for joint by joint, and knot by knot that (grass) does grow up;--'so do thou prolong us, O Dûrvâ (plant), by a thousand, and a hundred (descendants)!' as the text, so its meaning. 'Thou that spreadest by a hundred, and branchest out by a thousand (shoots);' for by a hundred (shoots) it spreads, and by a thousand it branches out;--'to thee, O divine brick, we will do homage by offering;' as the text, so the meaning.
atha dviyajuṣamupadadhāti /	With two (verses) he puts it on: the meaning of this has been explained.

Indra and Agni desired, 'May we go to the heavenly world!' They saw that dviyagus brick, even this earth, and laid it down; and having laid it down, they went to the heavenly world from that foundation. In like manner when this Sacrificer lays down a dviyagus (brick), (he does so) thinking, 'I want to go to the heavenly world by the same means (rûpa), by performing the same rite by which Indra and Agni went to the heavenly world!' And as to its being called 'dviyagus,' it is because two deities saw it. And as to why he lays down a dviyagus one: the dviyagus doubtless is the Sacrificer.

Well, that (gold man) is his divine body, and this (brick) is his human one. As to that gold man, that is his immortal form, his divine form; gold being immortal. And as to this (brick) being made of clay, it is because this is his human form.

He lays it down close to the dûrvâ-brick the dûrvâ-brick being cattle, he thus establishes the Sacrificer in (the possession of) cattle.

Well, the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath, and the dûrvâ-brick is the breath, and the dviyagus (-brick) is the Sacrificer:and inasmuch as he lays down the dûrvâ-brick close to the naturally-perforated one, he thereby connects and joins breath with breath; and inasmuch as he lays down the dviyagus one close to the dûrvâ-brick--the dûrvâ-brick being the breath, and the dviyagus the Sacrificer--those two bodies of his (the human one and the divine one) thus become connected together by the breath, and not severed.

And, moreover, it is because that material form (of the brick) is a twofold one, (consisting as it does of) clay and water. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

And the wide-ruling one and the self-ruling one being these two worlds, he lays them down separately, for separate are these two worlds. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes them one and the same (or, joined together), whence the ends of these two worlds meet.

'The wide-ruling one contained the light;--the self-ruling one contained the light,' he says; for the wide-ruling and the self-ruling ones are the testicles: they contain that light, the seed, Pragâpati. He lays them down separately, for separate are these testicles. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes them one and the same, whence they have a common connecting-part. He lays them down close to the dviyagus (brick) : the dviyagus being the Sacrificer, he thus puts the testicles together with the Sacrificer.

He lays it down close to the seed-shedding ones,--the seed-shedding ones being these two worlds, he thus places Agni together with these two worlds. He lays it down between (the two Retahsik ), for Agni (the fire) is within these two worlds.

He lays it down so as not to be separated from the seed-shedding (bricks),--the seed-shedders being the testicles, he thus makes the generative power inseparable from the testicles.

'Madhu and Mâdhava, the two spring seasons,'--these are the names of those two: it is thus by their names that he lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for two months are a season.

He lays them down close to the 'all-light' brick: the 'all-light' brick being progeny, he thus lays progeny close together with the seasons; whence progeny is produced in accordance with the seasons, for by seasons people compute (the age of man)whilst in the state of embryo, and by seasons when he is born.

Butspeech (the mouth) also indeed is the bearer of what is desirable; for the desirable is the vital airs, and for the (channels of) the vital airs food is put into the mouth: therefore speech is the bearer of what is desirable.

He lays down (the Ashâdhâ) close to the two seasonal ones: he thereby establishes speech in the seasons, and hence speech (the mouth) speaks here, firmly established in the seasons.

Well, the seasonal ones being the year, he thus separates speech from progeny by the year, and hence children utter speech at the time (or age) of a year.

When he has 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: the significance of this has been explained.

Let him say, There are two wombs (birthplaces)--the one being the womb of the gods, the other the womb of men: the gods have their birthplace in the east, and men in the west; and when he lays down those (bricks) in front, he thereby causes the Sacrificer to be born from the womb of the gods.

And that upper shell of it is yonder sky; it has its ends, as it were, bent down; for yonder sky has its ends, as it were, bent down. And what is between (the shells) is the air;--that (tortoise) thus is these worlds: it is these worlds he thus lays down (to form part of the altar).

Or, sour curds are the life-sap of this (earth-)world, ghee that of the air, and honey that of yonder sky: he thus supplies it with its own life-sap.

To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever (deity) a Yagus formula applies, that very deity the verse is, and that very deity the sacrificial formula is . This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gâyatrî verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.

Now what he created, he made; and inasmuch as he made (kar), he is (called) 'kûrma;' and 'kûrma' being (the same as) 'kasyapa' (a tortoise), therefore all creatures are said to be descended from Kasyapa.

On the right (south) of the Ashâdhâ (he places it), for the tortoise (kûrma, masc.) is a male, and the Ashâdhâ a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female;--at a cubit's distance , for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female. That Ashâdhâ is the consecrated queen (mahishî) of all the bricks, hence being on the right (south) side of her, it (the tortoise) is on the right side of all the bricks.

He puts it down in front looking towards the back: he thus puts in the breath in front tending towards the back; whence the breath is taken in from the front backwards. turned towards the (gold) man: he thus puts breath into the Sacrificer. South of the Ashâdhâ (he puts it), for the tortoise is breath, and the Ashâdhâ speech; and the breath (prâna, masc.) is the male, the mate, of speech (vâk, fem.).

With three (formulas) he anoints it; that makes six: the significance of this (number) has been explained. There are avakâ-plants below and avakâ-plants above (thetortoise),--the avakâ-plant means water: he thus places it in the midst of water. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

He saw these two bricks, the mortar and pestle. He placed them on (the altar); and by placing them thereon, he became an eater of food. In like manner, when the Sacrificer now places a mortar and pestle thereon, (he does so) thinking, 'I want to be an eater of food by the same means (rûpa), by performing the same rite by which Vishnu became an eater of food.' Now the mortar and pestle mean all (kinds of) food; for by the mortar and pestle food is prepared, and by means of them it is eaten.

And indeed the food which is proportionate to the body satisfies,and does no harm; but that which is excessive does harm; and that which is too little does not satisfy.

At the distance of the two retahsik (bricks, he places the mortar and pestle),--the 'seed-shedders' being these two (worlds ), he thus puts the trees in these two (worlds), and hence there are trees in these two (worlds). It (the mortar) is four-cornered,--there being four quarters, he thus places trees in all the quarters; whence there are trees in all the quarters. It is contracted in the middle, to give it the form of a (real) mortar.

'Wide space (uru) shall it make (karat) for me!' he said, hence 'urukara;' 'urukara' doubtless being what is mystically called 'ulûkhala' (the mortar); for the gods love the mystic.

The pestle is the sisna; it is round-like, for the sisna is round-like. He places it to the right (south of the mortar), for the male lies on the right side of the female. And what food there is for the consecrated animal, that is the dûrvâ-brick. The left (north) side of that (Agni or altar) is more raised,--that Agni is an animal, and hence the left side of the belly of a well-filled beast is more raised (than the right side).

He puts them in the fire-pan;--the pan being these worlds, and the heads of the victims being beasts, he thusputs animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.

Now those five layers are these worlds, and these worlds are this very fire-pan: thus, when he puts the heads of the victims in the fire-pan, he thereby unites those rumps with those heads.

He desired, 'May I create food, may I be reproduced!' He fashioned animals from his vital airs, a man from his soul (mind), a horse from his eye, a cow from his breath, a sheep from his ear, and a goat from his voice; and inasmuch as he created them from the vital airs, people say that 'Animals are vital airs.' The soul is the first of the vital airs; and inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is the first, and strongest of animals.' The soul is all the vital airs, for in the soul all the vital airs are established. And inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is all animals,' for they all belong to man.

That (animal food being put) in the fire-pan, and the fire-pan being the belly, he thus puts the food into the belly.

And if there are five victims, let him thrust in five times seven (chips); for those five victims he puts on (the fire-pan), and there are seven vitalairs in each victim: he thus puts the vital airs into all of them.

Let him not do so, for in this animal the form of all animals is contained ; and when he thrusts (seven chips) into this one, he thereby puts the vital airs into all of them.

Witha verse to Agni (he worships): it is to Agni he thereby makes amends;--with an undefined one; the undefined means everything: by means of everything he thus makes amends to him;--with (a verse) containing the word 'youngest:' this indeed, to wit, the youngest, is his favourite form.;--inasmuch as when born he took possession (yu) of everything here, he is the youngest (yavishtha).

He lays them down close to the (heads of the) animals: he thereby puts the water together with the animals.

He places them close to the victims: he thereby puts the flesh close to the (bones of the) cattle. The Apasyâh are inside, the Khandasyâh outside; for the water is inside, and the flesh outside.

Well, the skin of cattle is food, and the hair of cattle is food; and when he lays down the Khandasyâh, that is the skin of the victims, that is their hair. Or, again, those goats’ hair which are in the fire-pan , they are hair. The fire-pan is outside, and the victims’ heads are inside, for outside is the hair, and inside is the body.

And because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one sees him only when he goes towards the back (west). The Sun, indeed, having become the eye, remained behind: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).

He puts them down on every side: on every side he thus bestows the whole food on him. And verily these same Virâg (verses) sustain those vital airs, and inasmuch as they sustain (bhri) the vital airs (prâna) they are called Prânabhritah.

But, indeed, the vital airs are the vital airs, and the Prânabhrit is food, for food does uphold the vital airs.

And when after (the drawing of) the cups there are the chanting (of the Stotra) and the recitation (of the Sastra): this means that thereby he puts in for him both the stomas (hymn-forms) and the prishtha (sâmans) after (the drawing of) the cups .

But, surely, what the chant is that is the recitation ; for on whatsoever (verses) they chant a tune, those same (verses) he (the Hotri) recites thereafter ; and in this way, indeed, the Sastra also comes in this case to be put in for him.

The sâman, doubtless, is the husband of the Rik; and hence were he also in their case to speak as of a father's son, it would be as if he spoke of him who is the husband, as of the son: therefore it corresponds as regards the rik and sâman. 'And why does he thrice carry on (the generation from father to son)?'--father, son, and grandson: it is these he thereby carries on; and therefore one and the same (man) offers (food) to them .

On every side he lays down (the central bricks) : in every part he thuslays vital air into him; and in the same way indeed that intestinal breath (channel) is turned all roundthe navel. He lays them down both lengthwise and crosswise , whence there are here in the body (channels of) the vital airs both lengthwise and crosswise. He lays them down touching each other: he thereby makes these vital airs continuous and connects them; whence these (channels of the) vital airs are continuous and connected.

Let him not do so: the vital air is indeed the same as that gold man, but this body of his extends to as far here as this fire (altar) has been marked out. Hence to whateverlimb of his these (breath-holders) were not to reach, that limb of his the vital air would not reach; and, to be sure, to whatever limb the vital air does not reach, that either dries up or withers away: let him therefore lay down these (bricks) so as to be in contact with the enclosing stones; and by those which he lays down in the middle this body of his is filled up, and they at least are not separated from him.

Well, the Prânabhritah are the vital airs; and if he were to place them exactly opposite the quarters, then this breath would only pass forward and backward; but inasmuch as he now lays down these (bricks) thus defined in sidelong places, therefore this breath, whilst being a backward and forward one, passes sideways along all the limbs and the whole body."

He places these in the region of the two retahsik (bricks), for the retahsik are the ribs, and the ribs are the middle, and that body is in the middle (of the limbs). He places them all round, for that body extends all round.

Well, this (central set) is his (Agni's) body: he thus makes the body (trunk) the best, the largest, the most vigorous of limbs ; whence that body is the best, the largest, and most vigorous of limbs.

But indeed what he there said as to that contraction and expansion, it was only one of the princely order who said it; and assuredly were they to breathe upon it from outside a hundredtimes, or a thousand times, they could not lay breath into it. Whatever breath there is in the (main) body that alone is the breath: hence when he lays down the Prânabhritah (breath-holders), he thereby lays breath, the (power of) contraction and expansion, into it; and so it contracts and expands.

On every side (he places them): he thereby places cattle (or beasts) everywhere, whence there are cattle everywhere. He places them alongside of the Apasyâs: he thus establishes the cattle on (or, near) water, whence cattle thrive when it rains.

Gâyatrî, having become a metre, overtook them by dint of her vigour; and as to how Gâyatrî overtook them, it is that this is the quickest (shortest) metre. And so Pragâpati, in the form of that (Gâyatrî), by dint of his vigour, overtook those cattle.

And those cattle which went away from him (Pragâpati) are these fifteen other (formulas): the cattle are a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold: whence he who possesses cattle, drives off the evildoer, for the thunderbolt drives off the evildoer for him. And in whatever direction, therefore, the possessor of cattle goes, that he finds torn up by the thunderbolt.

Having then laid down those on the right (south) side, he lays down those on the left (north) side, thinking, 'Together with its sides this body shall be born.' Then those behind, for of (the animal) that is born the tail is born last.

And the animals which are the strongest he puts on the right side: he thus makes the right side of an animal the stronger; whence the right side of an animal is the stronger.

He then lays down two Lokamprinâ (bricks) in that corner : the significance of them (will be explained) further on . He throws loose earth on the layer: the significance of this (will be explained) further on .

And, again, as to why he lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles it by means of Visvakarman.

Indra and Agni, and Visvakarman took his middle part, and kept going away from him.

So Indra and Agni, and Visvakarman restored that (part) unto him.

Having settled it , he pronounces the Sûdadohas over it; the meaning of this has been explained.

But prior to these same (bricks) he lays down both the bunch of Darbha grass and the clod-bricks; and these (disyâs) being yonder sun , he thus places yonder sun over the regions, and builds him up upon (or, in) the regions. But were these (laid down) at the same time (as the bunch of grass and the clod-bricks), they would be outside (of the altar); and outside of the womb (foundation), indeed, is that sacrificial work regarding the fire-altar which is done prior to the lotus-leaf . When henow brings and lays down these (bricks), he thereby establishes them in the womb, on the lotus-leaf, and thus these (bricks) are not outside (the fire-altar). He lays them down so as not to be separated from the naturally-perforated one; for the middle naturally-perforated one is the air: he thus places the regions so as not to be separate from the air.

He places them so as not to be separated (by special bricks) from the naturally-perforated one; for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital air. Subsequently (to the central brick he lays them down): subsequently to (or upon) the vital air he thus places food. On the range of the Retahsik (he places them): the Retahsik being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the body), he thus places the food in the middle of this (Agni's body).

Thou art the supreme ruler, the Great region!' these are their names: he thus lays them down whilst naming them. Separately he lays them down, separately he settles them, and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas over them, for separate are the regions.
atha viśvajyotiṣamupadadhāti /	He then lays down a Visvagyotis (all-light brick).

He places it so as not to be separated from the regional ones : he thus places creatures in the regions, and hence there are creatures in all the regions.

Having settled it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas over it: the significance of this has been explained.

There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avakâ-plants and covers themwith avakâ-plants ; for avakâ-plants mean water he thus bestows water on that season, whence it rains most abundantly in that season.

He places them on avakâ-plants, for the avakâ-plants mean water: he thus bestows water before that season, whence it rains before that season. He does not cover them afterwards, whence it does not likewise rain after (that season).

yadveva catasraḥ catuṣpādā vai paśavo 'nnam paśavo madhyam madhyamā citirmadhyatastadannaṃ dadhāti //	And, again, why there are four,--animals are four-footed, and animals are food; and the middle-most layer is the middle (of Agni's body): he thus puts food in the middle.
caturakṣaraṃ vā antarikṣaṃ dvyakṣarā itarāścitayastadyāvadantarikṣaṃ tāvattatkṛtvopadadhāti // yadveva catasraḥ /	And, again, why there are four,--'antariksha' (air) consists of four syllables, and the other layers (kiti) consist of two syllables; hence as much as the air consists of, so much he makes it in laying it down.
paśureṣa yadagnirmadhyaṃ tatprati paśuṃ variṣṭhaṃ karoti tasmānmadhyam prati paśurvariṣṭhaḥ //	And, again, why there are four,--this Agni (altar), doubtless, is an animal: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence an animal is biggest towards the middle.

He lays them down so as not to be separated from the naturally-perforated one , for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital air.
atha prāṇabhṛta upadadhāti /	Subsequently (to the central brick) he lays them down: subsequentlyto (or upon) the vital air he thus places food.

He places them in the forepart (of the altar),--for there are these vital airs in front,--with , 'Protect my vital strength! protect mine up-breathing! protect my down-breathing! protect my through-breathing! protect mine eye! protect mine ear! increase my speech! animate my mind! protect my soul (or body)! give me light!'--He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal ones, for the vital air is wind: he thus establishes the wind in the seasons.
atha candasyā upadadhāti /	He then lays down the Khandasyâ (metres’ bricks).

He places them so as not to be separated from the Prânabhrits: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital airs subsequently (to them he places them): he thus bestows food after (bestowing) the vital airs.

Or, whatever food (anna) flows (sravati) from theseworlds that is 'asrîvayas.' Hereafter, now, he puts down only defined metres.

He lays down both defined and undefined ones: hence the defined (certain) food which is eaten does not fail.

In that (brihatî set of bricks) the gods come last (or, are highest).

And when subsequently he lays down thirty-six (Khandasyâs), they are the half-months and months--twenty-four half-months and twelve months: the moon, doubtless, is the year, and all living beings.

He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal (bricks): he thus establishes all living beings in the seasons.

And as to why they are called Vâlakhilyâs,--what (unploughed piece of ground lies) between two cultivated fields is called 'khila;' and these (channels of the) vital airs are separated from each other by the width of a horsehair (vâla), and because they are separated from each other by the width of a horse-hair, they (the bricks) are called Vâlakhilyâs.
sa vai sapta purastādupadadhāti /	He places seven in front, and seven at the back.

And those seven which (he places) behind he thereby makes the counter-breathings to those (first breathings); and hence by means of (the channels of) these breathings he passes over the food which he eats with those (other) breathings.

And as to what seven (bricks) he places behind,--there are seven vital airs here in the back part--the four thighs and knee-bones, the two feet, and what is below the navel that is the seventh, for in each limb there is a vital air: this makes seven vital airs here at the back; it is them he thus lays into him.

There are four (kinds of) four-footed (domestic) animals, and (domestic) animals are food: by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, they (the gods) established themselves in yonder world; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, establish himself in yonder world.
iyamu vai pratiṣṭhā te devā imām pratiṣṭhāmabhipratyāyaṃstathaivaitadyajamāna imām prati ṣāmabhipratyaiti //	That was, as it were, an ascent away from hence; but this (earth) is a foothold: the gods came back to this foothold; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now come back to this foothold.

athātaḥ saṃskṛtireva /	Now as to the restoration (of Pragâpati-Agni).

And as to why there are eleven of these, it is because the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the air is of the trishtubh nature. And the sixty subsequent (bricks) are Vâyu, Pragâpati, Agni, the Sacrificer.
śiro 'sya tāstā daśa bhavanti daśa vai prāṇāḥ prāṇā u vai śiraḥ pūrvārdha upadadhāti purastāddhīdaṃ śiraḥ //	Those which he places in front are his head: there are ten of them, because there are ten vital airs, and the head is (the focus of) the vital airs. He places them in front, because the head (of an animal) is here in front.

And those at the back are that (part) of him which is above the feet and below the waist. Those on the left (north) side are the feet themselves.

He places them so as not to he separated from those ten (Prânabhrits): he thereby puts in vital airs that are not separate from the head.

He places them so as not to be separated from those twelve (Khandasyâs): he thereby puts into him vital airs that are not separate from the body. That same Vâyu-Pragâpati is turned round in all directions in this trishtubh-like air; and when he lays down the third layer, having made up both Vâyu (the wind) and the air, he thereby adds them to himself. He then puts down two Lokamprinâ (space-filling bricks) in that corner : the significance of them (will be explained) further on . He throws loose earth (on the layer): the significance of this (will be explained) further on .
caturthīṃ citimupadadhāti /	He lays down the fourth layer.
etadvai devāstṛtīyāṃ citiṃ citvā samārohannantarikṣaṃ vai tṛtīyā citirantarikṣameva tatsaṃskṛtya samārohan //	For the gods having laid down the third layer, now ascended; but, the third layer being the air; it was the air which, having completed it, they ascended.

Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what is above the air and below the heavens; that world was to their minds, as it were, unstable and unsettled.

They accordingly laid the Brahman down here, whence people say that the Brahman is the highest of gods. Now, by this fourth layer these two, heaven and earth, are upheld, and the fourth layer is the Brahman, whence people say that heaven and earth are upheld by the Brahman. He lays down the Stomas (hymn-forms) : the stomas being the vital airs, and the Brahman also being the vital airs, it is the Brahman he thereby lays down.
yadveva stomānupadadhāti /	And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas.

So be it!' He did not say, 'What will therefrom accrue unto me?' but whenever Pragâpati wished to obtain anything from the gods, they said, 'What will therefrom accrue to us?' And hence even now if a father wishes to obtain anything from his sons, they say, 'What will therefromaccrue unto us?' and when the sons (wish to obtain anything) from the father, he says, 'So be it!' for in this way Pragâpati and the gods used of old to converse together. He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Pragâpati also being the vital airs, it is Pragâpati he thus lays down.
yadveva stomānupadadhāti /	And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas.

He lays down the Stomas:--the stomas being the vital airs, and the Rishis also being the vital airs, it is the Rishis he thus lays down.
yadveva stomānupadadhāti /	And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas.

Vâyu, taking that (part) of him which was above the waist and below the head, kept going away from him, having become the deities and the forms of the year.

He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Vâyu (the wind) also being the vital airs, it is Vâyu he thus lays down.

And what he generated, he created; and inasmuch as he created (srig), therefore they are called creations (srishti). Having created them, he made them enter his own self: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now cause these creatures to be generated by that seventeenfold year, by Pragâpati, the progenitor; and having created them, he makes them enter his own self . On therange of the Retahsik (he lays down these bricks): the Retahsik being the ribs, and the ribs the middle (of the body), it is in the very middle that he causes these creatures to enter him. He lays them on all sides: from all sides he thus makes these creatures to enter him.

He (Pragâpati) was aware of him, and having seen him, he walked round and laid down (at the back) the (brick) containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma). Death came thither, and he (Pragâpati) laid down the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma). Death came to the fifteenfold one, and he (Pragâpati) laid down the one (on the north side) containing the seventeenfold (stoma).

And because he thus changes in laying them down , therefore they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas; and because these stomas are then otherwise with regard to the former ones , therefore also they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas. And in this way the gods laid them down, and otherwise the Asuras; whereupon the gods succeeded, and the Asuras came to naught: he who knows this, succeeds of himself, and his hateful enemy comes to naught.

There are two of them, because the head consists of two bones (kapâla). He lays them down in front, for this head is in the front (of the animal).

And as to why these are such as contain the Pañkadasa,--the arms are fifteenfold. There are two of them, because these arms are two. He places them on the sides, because these two arms are at the sides.

There are two of them, because 'anna' (food) has two syllables. He lays them down close to those containing the Pañkadasa he thus puts the food close to the arms. Those containing the Pañkadasa are on the outside, and those containing the Saptadasa on the inside: he thus encloses the food on both sides by the arms.

He places them in every direction, for this body (extends) in every direction. And as to what other (space) there is besides this, that is left over;--and what is left over for the gods, that is these metres;--and as to thesemetres, they are cattle;--and as to cattle, they are (objects of) good fortune;--and as to these (objects of) good fortune, they are yonder sun: he is that one to the south of them.

Let him not do so: they cause a redundancy,--it would be just as if one were to put two other jaws to the already existing jaws, as if one were to put another tongue to the already existing tongue. That (brick) wherein the head is indeed (includes) the jaws and the tongue.

But let him place them in front; for where the head is there are also the jaws and the tongue: and thus he places the signs of good fortune at the head (or, in the mouth, mukhatah), whence they say that he who has a (peculiar) mark in his mouth has good luck.

It is the Stomas’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the hymn-forms , it is the Stomas’layer. It is the layer of the vital airs: inasmuch as they laid down the vital airs , it is the layer of the vital airs. Hence, whatsoever one may know, that comes to be included in the ancestry, in the kinship of this layer.--He then lays down two Lokamprinâs (space-filling bricks) in that corner : the significance of these (will be explained) farther on . He throws loose soil thereon: the significance of this (will be explained) farther on .

And in like manner does the Sacrificer, by laying them down, now make that world foeless, undisturbed. On all (four) sides he lays them down: on all sides he thus makes that world foeless, undisturbed. He places them on the other side: he thereby makes that whole world foe-less, undisturbed.

He lays them down by tens: the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables, and this layer is 'virâg.' He places them on every side; for he who shines (rules) in one direction only, does not shine far and wide, but whosoever shines in all directions, he alone shines far and wide.

He saw those foeless bricks, and laid them down, and by means of them he drove off evil, for foe means evil; and because, by means of them he drove off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) 'foeless' (bricks).

He places them on every side: he thereby drives off the foe, evil, on every side. He places them on the other side: from his whole self he thereby drives off the foe, evil.

agneḥ purīṣamasīti brahma vai caturthī citiragniru vai brahma tasyā etatpurīṣamiva yatpañcamyapso nāmeti tasyokto bandhuḥ //	Then in the middle (the fifth), with, 'Agni's soil-cover thou art!'--the fourth layer indeed is the Brahman, and the Brahman is Agni, and this, the fifth layer is, as it were, the (soil-)cover of that (fourth layer);--'his sap, in truth: may the All-gods sing thy praises! Seat thee here, laden with Stomas, and rich in fat! Gain for us, bysacrifice, wealth with offspring!' as the text so the sense.

On the right (south) side (from the centre he places it), for the thunderbolt has a string on the right side;--inside the one in the southern quarter, for it is for the sake of extension that he leaves that space.

tau bāhū sa yo 'syābhitaḥ pāpmāsīdbāhubhyāṃ tamapāhata tathaivaitadyajamāno yo 'syābhitaḥ pāpmā bhavati bāhubhyāmeva tamapahate //	And the two on both sides (of the spine) are the two arms: whatever evil there was sideways of him, that he drove away with his arms; and in like manner does this Sacrificer now drive away with his arms whatever evil there is sideways of him.
sa yo 'syopariṣṭhātpāpmāsīdannena tamapāhāta tathaivaitadyajamāno yo 'syopariṣṭātpāpmā bhavatyannenaiva tamapahate //	The soil-bedded one means food: whatever evil there was above him, that he (Pragâpati) drove away by means of food; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by means of food, drive away whatever evil there is above him.

Hence, one must not speak ill of him who knows this, lest one should be his evil (enemy).

The gods gave him that food, these (bricks) relating to the metres; for the metres are cattle, and cattle are food. They (the metres) pleased him, and inasmuch as they pleased (khand) him they are (called) metres (khandas).

On all (four) sides he places them: from all sides he thus bestows food on him.

There are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the front part, for these vital airs are in the front part.

By the first set of ten they (the gods) ascended this (earth), by the second the air, by the third the sky; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by the first set of ten, ascend this (earth), by the second the air, and by the third the sky.

And that last set of ten is this world: hence, even as (takes place) that start from the first set of ten, so from the last; for this is the same,--those two sets of ten (the first and last) are this (terrestrial) world.

He spake, 'Why dost thou go from me? why dost thou leave me?'--'Give me the essence of that food: enter me therewith!'--'So be it!' so he gave him the essence of that food, and entered him therewith.

Thus whatever he mentions here, that and the essence thereof he puts together and makes it enter his own self: 'By such and such quicken thou such and such!'--'Such and such thou art: for such and such (I deposit) thee!'--'By the lord, by strength, quicken strength!' thus they (the bricks) are divided into three kinds, for food is of three kinds.

They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even the firmament, the heavenly world, and laid it down. Now that same firmament, the heavenly world, indeed is the same as these Stomabhâgâs, and thus in laying down these, he lays down the firmament, the heavenly world.

But let him not do so: they (who do so) exceed (this layer so as not to be) amounting to the twenty-one-fold, and to the Gâyatrî; and that undiminished Virâg, doubtless, is the world of Indra: in the world of Indra they raise a spiteful enemy of equal power (to Indra), and thrust Indra out of the world of Indra. And at his own sacrifice the Sacrificer assuredly is Indra: in the Sacrificer's realm they raise for the Sacrificer a spiteful enemy of equal power, and thrust the Sacrificer out of the Sacrificer's own realm. But, surely, that fire which they bring hither is no other than this Sacrificer: by means of his foundation it is he who is the thirtieth (brick) in this (layer).
tā aṣāḍhāyai velayopadadhāti / vāgvā aṣāḍhā rasa eṣa vāci tadrasaṃ dadhāti tasmātsarveṣāmaṅgānāṃ vācaivānnasya rasaṃ vijānāti //	He lays them down on the range of the Ashâdhâ; for the Ashâdhâ is speech, and this (set of bricks ) is the essence (of food): he thus lays into speech the essence of food; whence it is through (the channel of) speech that one distinguishes the essence of food for all the limbs.
yadvevāṣāḍhāyai / iyaṃ vā aṣāḍhāsāvāditya stomabhāgā amuṃ tadādityamasyām pratiṣṭhāyām pratiṣṭhāpayati //	And, again, as to why (on the range) of the Ashâdhâ;--the Ashâdhâ, doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabhâgâs are yonder sun: he thus establishes yonder sun upon this earth as a firm foundation.

He lays them down on every side: he thus places the heart, the mind everywhere; whence everywhere on this (earth) one thinks with the heart, with the mind. And, moreover, these (bricks) are lucky signs: he places them on all sides; whence they say of him who has a (lucky) sign (lakshman) on every (or any) side that he has good luck (punyalakshmîka).
athaināḥ purīṣeṇa pracādayati / annaṃ vai purīṣaṃ rasa eṣa tametattiraḥ karoti tasmāttira ivānnasya rasaḥ //	He then covers them with loose soil; for loose soil (purîsha) means food, and this (set of bricks) is the essence (of food): he thus makes it invisible, for invisible, as it were, is the essence of food.
yadveva purīṣeṇa / annaṃ vai purīṣaṃ rasa eṣo 'nnaṃ ca tadrasaṃ ca saṃtanoti saṃdadhāti //	And, again, as to why (he covers it) with loosesoil;--loose soil, doubtless, means food, and this (set of bricks) is the essence: he thus joins and unites the food and its essence.
hṛdayaṃ vai stomabhāgāḥ purītatpurīṣaṃ hṛdayaṃ tatpurītatā pracādayati // yadveva purīṣeṇa /	And, again, as to why with loose soil;--the Stomabhâgâs are the heart, and the loose soil is the pericardium: he thus encloses the heart in the pericardium.

He places them in the last layer, for this, the last, layer is the end of Agni: it is thus at the end that hepronounces the prayers for prosperity to Agni. There are five of them, for at the sacrifice there are five prayers for prosperity . Between (each) two he throws loose soil, for these two bricks being fires, he does so fearing lest these two fires should blaze up together. And, moreover, loose soil means food: it is thus by means of food that he brings about concord between them.

Then the upper ones: having first laid down one in front, he lays down those on the right, on the left, in the middle, and behind. And, indeed, the world of heaven is entered from below, for the gods, having at that time, closed up these worlds on all sides, entered the world of heaven from below; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having closed up these worlds on all sides, enter the world of heaven from below.
candasyā upadadhāti /	He lays down Khandasyâs (bricks pertaining to the metres).

He now wished for distinction ; for, indeed, heretofore he was not equal thereto, that he should sustain distinction; whence people here say even to this day, 'This one is not equal to sustain distinction, either in regard to kingship or to headmanship.' The gods bestowed on him this distinction, these Khandasyâs; for the metres (Khandas) are cattle, and cattle are food, and (a position of) distinction is food.

One of them is an Atikhandas (excessive metre); for even whilst being one, that one is beyond all the metres.
tasya śiro gāyatryaḥ /	And as to that distinction, it is this great hymn of praise ; and as to this great hymn of praise, it is these Khandasyâs.

The others result in Gâyatrîs: this is just that fourscore of Gâyatrîs , the Brihatîs (make up) the Bârhata one, and the Ushnihs the Aushniha one. And as to the Vasa hymn , the two half-verses, the Aindrâgna (hymn), and the insertion, they are Atikhandas; and as tothe Nada-verse , the Sûdadohas, the pâda-appendages, and whatever Anushtubh matter there is, they make up the Anushtubhs.
pratiṣṭhā dvipadāḥ /	Dvipadâ verses are the feet.
etāvadvai mahaduktham mahadukthaṃ śrīḥ sarvāmevāsmā etāṃ devāḥ prāyacaṃstathaivāsmā ayametāṃ sarvāṃ śriyam prayacati //	Thus much is the great hymn of praise, and the great hymn of praise means distinction: the gods bestowed upon him (Agni) all that distinction, and so does this (Sacrificer) bestow upon him all that distinction.
yadveva candasyā upadadhāti /	And, again, as to why he lays down the Khandasyâs.
etadvai devā etaṃ nākaṃ svargaṃ lokamapaśyannetā stomabhāgāstasminnaviśaṃsteṣāṃ viśatām prajāpatiruttamo 'viśatsa yaḥ sa prajāpatiretāstāścandasyāḥ //	The gods at that time saw that firmament, the world of heaven, to wit, those Stomabhâgâs, and entered it. Of those entering, Pragâpati enteredlast; and thus Pragâpati is the same as these Khandasyâs.
tasya śiro gāyatryaḥ /	Gâyatrîs are his head; and as to its being Gâyatrîs, it is because the head is of Gâyatrî nature .
tā yadgāyatryo bhavanti gāyatraṃ hiśirastisro bhavanti trivṛddhi śiraḥ pūrvārdha upadadhāti purastāddhīdaṃ śiraḥ //	There are three, for the head is threefold. He places them on the forepart (of the altar), for the head (of the animal or bird) is in front.
tā retaḥsicorvelayopadadhāti pṛṣṭayo vai retaḥsicā uro vai prati pṛṣṭayaḥ //	Trishtubhs are the chest: he places them on the range of the two Retahsik; for the Retahsik are the ribs, and the ribs lie against the chest.

sakthyāvanuṣṭubhaḥ / tā anantarhitā jagatībhya upadadhātyanantarhite tacroṇibhyaṃ sakthyo dadhāti //	Anushtubhs are the thighs: he places them close to the Gagatîs, and thereby places the thighs close to the hips.
parśavo bṛhatyaḥ /	Brihatîs are the ribs, Kakubhs the breast-bone.
kīkasāḥ kakubhaḥ so 'ntareṇa triṣṭubhaśca kakubhaśca bṛhatīrupadadhāti tasmādimā ubhayatra parśavo baddhāḥ kīkasāsu ca jatruṣu ca //	The Brihatîs he places between the Trishtubhs and Kakubhs, whence these ribs are fastened on both sides, on the breast-bone and the costal cartilages .
grīvā uṣṇihaḥ / tā anantarhitā gāyatrībhya upadadhātyanantarhitāstacīrṣṇo grīvā dadhāti //	Ushnihs are the neck: he places them close to the Gâyatrîs, and thereby places the neck close to the head.

He places them sideways, for these wings are sideways. Whatever metre is larger that he places on the right side: he thus makes the right half of the animal the stronger, and hence the right side of an animal is the stronger.

And inasmuch as this (brick) eats (atti) the metres (khandas), the cattle, it is called Attikhandas, for Attikhandas is really what is mystically called Atikhandas; for the gods love the mystic.
yoniḥ purīṣavatī /	A (brick) covered with loose soil is the womb.
te saṃsoṛṣṭe upadadhāti saṃspṛṣṭe hyudaraṃ ca yoniśca purīśasaṃhite bhavato māṃsaṃ vai purīṣam māṃsena vā udaraṃ ca yoniśca saṃhite pūrvāticandā bhavatyaparā purīṣavatyuttaraṃ hyudaramadharā yoniḥ //	These two he lays close to each other, for the belly and the womb are close to each other. They are connected with loose soil, for loose soil means flesh, and both the belly and the womb are connected with flesh. The former is an Atikhandas, the latter a soil-bedded one (purîshavatî), for the belly is higher, and the womb lower.
te prācyā upadadhāti / prāṅ hyeṣo 'gniścīyate 'tho prāgvai prāca udaram prācī yonirbahistomabhāgaṃ hṛdayaṃ vai stomabhāgā hṛdayamu vā uttamathodaramatha yoniḥ //	He places them so as to extend eastwards, for in an easterly direction this Agni (fire-altar) is built; and, moreover, in one moving forward, both the belly and the womb are moving forward. Outside the Stomabhâgâs (he places them), for the Stomabhâgâs are the heart, and the heart is highest, then (comes) the belly, then the womb.
te dakṣiṇataḥ svayamātṛṇāyā upadadhāti /	He places them south of the naturally-perforated (brick).
atha prathamāyāṃ citā uttararaḥ svayamātṛṇāyā udaraṃ ca yoniṃ copadadhāti yo vā ayam madhye prāṇastadeṣā svayamātṛṇaitasya tatprāṇasyobhayata udaraṃ ca yoniṃ ca dadhāti tasmādetasya prāṇasyobhayata udaraṃ ca yoniśca //	Now, in the first layer, he placesboth the belly and the womb north of the naturally-perforated one ; for that naturally-perforated one, indeed, is what this vital air in the middle (of the body) is: he thus places the belly and the womb on both sides of that (central) vital air, and hence the belly and the womb are on both sides of that central vital air.
pratiṣṭhā dvipadāḥ / tā yaddvipadā bhavanti dvandvaṃ hi pratiṣṭhā tisro bhavanti trivṛddhi pratiṣṭhā paścādupadadhāti paścādhīyam pratiṣṭhā //	The Dvipadâs are the feet (the stand);--and as to its being Dvipadâs (verses of two feet), it is because the feet are a pair. There are three (such verses), for a stand (tripod) is threefold. He lays them down at the back, for the feet are at the back (of the body).

And as to why he says, 'The gods (are) in the highest heaven of light,'--the light, doubtless, is this Agni (the fire-altar), and it is on his highest layer that all the gods have thus entered: this is why he says, 'The gods are in the highest heaven of light.'
gārhapatyamupadadhāti /	He lays down the Gârhapatya.

They spake, 'Whereby have we succeeded in this?'--'By means of the Gârhapatya,' they said; 'for, after building the Gârhapatya and mounting thereon, we saw the first layer, from the first (we saw) the second, from the second the third, from the third the fourth, from the fourth the fifth, and from the fifth this one.'

Having brought this (Gârhapatya) here, they put iton. They disputed about it:--in the front part (of the fifth layer) the Vasus, on the right side the Rudras, on the hind part the Âdityas, on the left side the Maruts, and above it the Visve Devâs said. 'Here let us lay it down! here.

They laid it down in the middle (of the fifth layer), and thus they laid that success into the self (or the body of the altar);--in the middle (they laid it): they thus laid that success into the very middle of (Agni's and their own) self. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down the Gârhapatya, lay that success into (his own) self; and (by laying it down) in the middle, he lays that success into the very middle of the self.

annaṃ vai gārhapatyo 'ttāyamagniścito 'ttra evaitadannamapidadhāti madhyato madhyata evāsminnetadannaṃ dadhāti //	The Gârhapatya, doubtless, is food, and this built Agni is an eater: it is to the eater he thus offers that food;--in the centre (he lays down the Gârhapatya): in the very middle (of the body) he thus lays food into him.
yadveva gārhapatyamupadadhāti /	And, again, as to why he lays down the Gârhapatya.

yadveva gārhapatyamupadadhāti /	And, again, as to why he lays down the Gârhapatya.

Eight bricks he lays down: the significance of this has been explained . He builds it up with the same formulas and in the same order, for this one is the same as that (former Gârhapatya Agni) he thus brings it (or him) here and lays it down.
atha punaścitimupadadhāti /	He then lays down the Punaskiti .

And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, when he lays down the Punaskiti, lay seed and generative power into this womb;--in the centre (he lays it down): he thus lays seed and generative power into the very middle of this womb.

Let him not do this, for they who do this lay seed and generative power outside the womb; but let him rather place it in the centre: he thus lays seed and generative power right into the womb.

Five times he 'settles' it,--of five layers consists the fire-altar, five seasons make a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus introduces him in the form of seed. Eight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes thirteen,--thirteen months make a year, and there are thirteen 'layer-fillings' of the altar: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus becomes.

Let him not do this, for the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and the Âhavanîya is the sky; and above this (earth) surely is yonder (sky); let him therefore place it (the Punaskiti) on the top of that (Gârhapatya).
yadveva gārhapatyaṃ ca punaścitiṃ copadadhāti /	And as to why he lays down both the Gârhapatya and the Punaskiti.

Now those two former (altars of this kind) which he throws up belong to the Soma-sacrifice, but these belong to the fire-altar; and when, after laying down these two; he deposits Agni (the fire) thereon, then he establishes him both on the Vedi and the Uttaravedi.

He now builds him up again; and inasmuch as he again (punas) builds up (ki) that (Agni) already built, therefore also it is (called) Punaskiti.

Eight bricks he lays down: the meaning of this also has been explained .

And, indeed, the seasonal ones are everything here, for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year is everything here: he thus lays down everything here. And generative power they also are,--for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year means generative power: it is generative power he thus lays down (or bestows on Agni and the Sacrificer).

He lays down (some of) them in all the layers: he thus places the nobility as the eater among the whole people .

These (formulas of the seasonal bricks) begin in a different way, but end in the same way; for the seasons were created, and, when created, they were different.

They united in each single season with their forms, whence there is in each single season the form of all the seasons. As to their (formulas) beginning in a different way, it is because they were created different (or separately); and as to their ending in the same way, it is because they united with their forms.

Tapa (the burner), doubtless, is yonder sun: from him these two seasons are not separated; and inasmuch as these two seasons are not separated from him, they are called Tapa and Tapasya.

Two bricks there are, because the season consists of two months.
tadyadete atropadadhāti /	Only once he 'settles' them: he thereby makes the season to be one.

But generative power there also is (in these seasonal bricks) : he thus places generative power on this side of the sky and the sun; whence procreation takes place only on this side of them, but stationary, indeed, is procreation beyond them, for just as many gods as there were of old, so many there are now.

But generative power there also is therein: he thus places generative power above this (earth); whence procreation only takes place above (upon, not under) this (earth).

And the seasonal ones, indeed, are also the year: by the (different) layers he thus builds up the year. Let him not thereafter place over them any other brick with a sacrificial formula, lest he should place the peasantry above the nobility.

But there also is generative power therein: he thus places generative power on this side of the sky, whence procreation takes place only on this side thereof.

And what second (such brick there is) that is its mate,--a mate, doubtless, is one half of one's own self, for when one is with a mate then he is whole and complete: (thus it is laid down) for the sake of completeness. With a single formula he lays down many bricks : he thereby endows the nobility preeminentlywith power , and makes the nobility more powerful than the peasantry. And the other (bricks) he lays down singly, with separate formulas: he thereby makes the peasantry less powerful than the nobility, differing in speech, and of different thoughts (from one another).

On the body (of the altar) he places them both lengthwise and crosswise, for the bricks are bones: hence these bones in the body run both lengthwise and crosswise. On the wings and tail (he places them so as to be) turned away (from the body), for in the wings and tail there is not a single transverse bone. And this, indeed, is the difference between a built and an unbuilt (altar): suchlike is the built one, different therefrom the unbuilt one .

With that (kind of brick) he fills up the whole body: he thereby kindles the whole body by means of the sun, whence this whole body (of ours) is warm. And this, indeed, is the difference between one that will live and one that will die:he that will live is warm, and he that will die is cold.

If he were not to reach any member thereof, then the vital air would not reach that member of him (Agni); and whatever member the vital air does not reach, that, assuredly, either dries up or withers away: let him therefore fill up therewith the whole of it.

Let him not throw aside an unbroken (brick), lest he should put what is not sickly outside the body. Whatever (bricks), in counting from the dhishnya hearths, should exceed a Virâg , and not make up another, such (bricks) indeed cause failure: let him break them and throw them (ut-kir) on the heap of rubbish (utkara), for the heap of rubbish is the seat of what is redundant: thus he thereby settles them where there is. the seat of that which is redundant.

The largest (bricks) should be of the measure of the thigh-bone, for there is no bone larger than the thigh-bone. Three layers should have (their bricks) marked with three lines, for threefold are these worlds; and two (layersmay consist) of (bricks) marked with an indefinite number of lines, for these two layers are the flavour, and the flavour is indefinite; but all (the layers) should rather have (bricks) marked with three lines, for threefold are all these worlds.

Moreover, bricks with (special) formulas are food, and the middle layer is the belly: he thus puts food into the belly.

But he may, nevertheless, lay them down; for such bricks are laid down for (the fulfilment of special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. But let him rather not lay them down, for just that much the gods then did.

In that manner he covers the whole body (of the altar); whence the food which is put into (the channels of) the vital air benefits the whole body, extends over the whole body.

Let him, nevertheless, strew it, for the vital airs are sustained by food, and whoever eats no food his (channels of the) vital airs grow up (and close): hence he for whom they act thus, comes to exist in yonder world even like a dry, hollow tube. Let him, therefore, by all means strew (loose soil) on (the place of) the naturally-perforated one.

And, assuredly, whatsoever member thereof he should not reach, that member of him (Agni) the vital air would notreach; and whatever member the vital air does not reach that either dries up or withers away: let him, therefore, cover it entirely therewith.

With this anushtubh verse addressed to Indra he scatters it; for the loose soil belongs to Indra: that (layer of) loose soil is one half of Agni (the fire-altar), the (other) half is the collection of bricks.

Indra, surely, is equal to all the gods; hence in that he scatters it with a (verse) addressed to Indra, this (soil) is one half of Agni.

He lays them down as the last (highest), for wind and sky are the highest; and close together, for wind andsky are close together. The Vikarnî he lays down first: he thereby places the wind on this side of the sky; whence that wind blows only on this side (thereof).

Now that thread is the same as the wind; and that wind is the same as this Vikarnî: thus when he lays down the latter, then yonder sun strings to himself these worlds on a thread.

He lays them down as the two last (highest bricks), because vital power and vital air are the two highest (endowments); and close together, because vital power and vital air are closely (bound) together. The upper (northern) Vikarnî he lays down first : he thereby encloses the vital air on both sides in vital power.

With a trishtubh verse he lays it down, because Vâyu (the wind) is of trishtubh nature; with one relating to Agni, because it is Agni's performance; with an undefined one, because Vâyu is undefined. And as to his saying 'the wind,' Vâyu indeed is the wind.

They are both of them stones and both of them naturally-perforated; for vital power and vital air are the same. He then pronounces the Sûdadohas over them,--the Sûdadohas means vital air; he thus makes themcontinuous, joins them together by means of the vital air.

With an anushtubh verse (he performs this rite), for the Anushtubh is speech, and speech (includes) all vital airs; and by means of speech, that is vital air, he thus makes these two (bricks) continuous, and joins them together. This same Sûdadohas, whilst being a single (verse), extends over all the bricks, whence--the Sûdadohas being the vital air--this vital air, whilst being one only, extends over all the limbs, over the whole body.

With 'In the rock is thy hunger,' he (after watering the altar) sets down (the pitcher on the stone): he thus lays hunger into the stone, whence the stone is not fit for eating. But hard also is the stone, and hard is hunger: he thus puts the hard along with the hard. With, 'In me thy food!' he takes up (the pitcher): he thereby takes up the food into his own self.

He may say, 'Let thy pain enter so-and-so!' naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold upon him; but let him take no notice of this, for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this hates. If it should remain unbroken, let him bid (the Pratiprasthâtri) to break it; for only when it is broken, the pain enters him whom he hates.

Hence also he need not care to make many (cows) his own , for in yonder world that (Sacrificer), by means of the Brahman (holy writ), the Yagus, will make many (cows) his own. And in that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly, thereby he carries on, without interruption, his objects of desire.

And in that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly, thereby it is Speech herself that he carries on:--'Let these bricks be mine own milch cows, O Agni, hereafter in yonder world!' He thereby makes them his own milch cows in this world, and he also makes them his own milch cows in yonder world; and thus they are profitable to him in both worlds, in this one and in the other.

They called them by the name 'the widely-shining,' and they turned unto them. Hence, each time he has laid down ten bricks, he addresses them with the 'space-filling (verse)': he thereby makes them widely-shining (virâg), for the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables:--'wish-milking, never-failing,'--he thereby makes them wish-milking and never-failing.

And because they said, 'Down (avâk) has gone our moisture (ka),' they became avâkkâs;--'avâkkâs,' they mystically call 'avakâs (lotuses),' for the gods love the mystic.

Sâman-hymns are (used), for sâmans are vital airs,and the vital airs are immortality: immortality, that highest form, he thus lays into him. On every side he sings around it: everywhere he thus lays immortality, that highest form, into him.

They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may make this body of ours boneless and immortal!'

On every side he sings: everywhere he thus makes that body of his boneless and immortal. Standing he sings, for these worlds stand, as it were; and whilst standing one doubtless is stronger. He sings, after uttering (the syllable) 'him,' for therein the sâman-hymn becomes whole and complete.
gāyatram purastādgāyati / agnirvai gāyatramagnimevāsyaitaciraḥ karotyatho śira evāsyaitadanasthikamamṛtaṃ karoti //	He first sings the Gâyatra hymn , for the Gâyatrî metre is Agni: he thus makes Agni hishead, and that head of his (or of him, Agni) he thus makes boneless and immortal.

Let none other but the Adhvaryu sing; for these (hymns) are bricks, and he (Agni, the fire-altar) would be built up in the wrong way , were any other than the Adhvaryu to sing.

Then these three (materials), sour curds, honey and ghee, are poured together, either into a dish, or a pot with a wide mouth; and he puts a handful of sacrificial grass thereon.

With ghee (they offer), for with ghee they offer on the high-altar;--with fivefold-taken (ghee), for with fivefold-taken (ghee) they offer on the high-altar:--by turns (he makes the libations), for by turns they make the libations on the high-altar.

By means of the oblation he makes them a deity: for whatever deity the oblation is prepared, that deity (they are), not that deity for whom it is not prepared. And, in calling them by their names, he also thereby places those fires along with this fire.

Everywhere he sprinkles, even outside the enclosing-stones; everywhere he thus bestows on him the highest form;--by means of sacrificial grass-stalks (he sprinkles), for they are pure and meet for sacrifice; by means of their tops (he sprinkles), for the top (is sacred) to the gods.

With sour curds, honey and ghee (he sprinkles): the significance of this has been explained.

He takes (the oblations) in the same offering-ladle, for one and the same (Agni) is he whom he regales therewith.

With two (verses) he deposits it: the significance of this has been explained,--with the Vashat-call: the significance of this (will be explained) farther on.

The gods were afraid of him, lest he might injure them. They saw this samî tree, and therewith appeased him; and inasmuch as they appeased (sam) him by that samî, it is (called) Samî; and in like manner this (Sacrificer) now appeases him by means of that samî (wood),--just with a view to appeasement, not for food.

athaudumbarīmādadhāti /	He then puts on one of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood;--the Udumbara means strength and sap: with strength and sap he thus gratifies him.

If he cannot get one with bifurcate branches, let him take up a globule of sour curds and put it on (the wood): that globule of sour curds which supervenes is a form of cattle. With the virâg , 'Kindled, blaze forth, O Agni, before us, (with inexhaustible flame, O youngest! perpetual viands accrue unto thee!)'--he puts it on;--the Virâg means food: with food he thus gratifies him. Three pieces of wood he puts on,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.
athāhutīrjuhoti /	He then offers oblations,--this is just as if, after serving food to some one, one gives him something to drink.

With a paṅkti (verse) he offers,--of five feet consists the Paṅkti, of five layers the fire-altar, five seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.

Three oblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him. Three logs he puts on,--that makes six: the significance of this has been explained.

Sitting heoffers the oblations,--oblations are the flesh, and the flesh sits (lies), so to speak. The logs are inside (the fire), and the oblations outside, for the bones are inside, and the flesh is outside.

With two (verses) he deposits the fire,--that makes thirty-two, and of thirty-two syllables consists the Anushtubh: such, then, is this Anushtubh.

It is one of twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and Vaisvânara is the year.

Silently it is (performed) there, for there seed (is implied) in the sacrifice, and silently seed is infused; but distinctly on the present occasion, for distinct (manifest) is the seed when born.
sa yaḥ sa vaiśvānaraḥ / ime sa lokā iyameva pṛthivī viśvamagnirnaro 'ntarikṣameva viśvaṃ vāyurnaro dyaureva viśvamādityo naraḥ //	Now, that Vaisvânara is all these worlds: this earth is the All (visva), and Agni is its man (nara); the air is the All, and Vâyu (the wind) is its man (ruler); the sky is the All, and Âditya (the sun) is its man.
idaṃ tacira idameva pṛthivyoṣadhayaḥ śmaśrūṇi tadetadviśvaṃ vāgevāgniḥ sa naraḥ sopariṣṭādasya bhavatyupariṣṭāddhyasyā agniḥ //	And these worlds are the same as this head,--this (lower part of the head) is the earth, the plants (being) the hair of its beard: this is the All, and Agni is Speech, he is the man. That (speech) is at the top thereof, for Agni is on the top of this (earth).
tasmādetadalomakamalomakamiva hyantarikṣaṃ tadetadviśvam prāṇa eva vāyuḥ sa naraḥ sa madhyenāsya bhavati madhyena hyantarikṣasya vāyuḥ //	This (central part of the face) is the air, whence it is hairless, for hairless, as it were, is the air; it is this All, and Vâyu (the wind) is the breath, he is the man; he is in the middle thereof, for the wind is in the middle of the air.

Vaisvânara is the head thereof, and this built-up Agni (the altar) is the body: thus, having completed his body, he restores the head thereto.
atha mārutānjuhoti / prāṇā vai mārutāḥ prāṇānevāsminnetaddadhāti vaiśvānaraṃ hutvā śiro vai vaiśvānaraḥ śīrṣaṃstatprāṇāndadhāti //	He then offers the (cakes) to the Maruts;--the Maruts’ (cakes) are the vital airs: he thus puts the vital airs into him (Agni). after offering the Vaisvânara; for the Vaisvânara is the head: he thus puts vital airs into the head.
eka eṣa bhavati /	That (Vaisvânara oblation) is a single one, for single, as it were, is the head; the others (viz.
ekamiva hi śiraḥ saptetare saptakapālā yadu vā api bahu kṛtvaḥ sapta-sapta saptaiva tacīrṣaṇyeva tatsapta prāṇāndadhāti //	the Mârutas) are seven in number, of seven potsherds each; and though 'seven-seven' means 'many times,' here it is only seven : he thus places seven vital airs in the head.

Standing he offers the former, for the head stands, so to speak; sitting the others, for the vital airs are, so to speak, seated.
tadyau prathamau mārutau juhoti / imau tau prāṇau tau madhye vaiśvānarasya juhoti madhye hīmau śīrṣṇaḥ prāṇau //	Now, the first two Mâruta (oblations) he offers are these two vital airs (in the ears): he offers them in the middle of the Vaisvânara (oblations), for these two vital airs are in the middle of the head.
atha yau dvitīyau / imau tau tau samantikataraṃ juhoti samantikataramiva hīmau prāṇau //	And the second pair are these two (vital airsin the eyes); he offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs.

imau tau tau samantikataraṃ juhoti samantikataramiva hīmau prāṇau vāgevāraṇye 'nūcyaḥ so 'raṇye 'nūcyo bhavati bahu hi vācā ghoraṃ nigacati //	He offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs. The one to be recited in the forest is speech: it is to be recited in the forest, for by speech one gets into much terrible (trouble).
yadveva vaiśvānaramārutānjuhoti / kṣatraṃ vai vaiśvānaro viṇmārutāḥ kṣatraṃ ca tadviśaṃ ca karoti vaiśvānaram pūrvaṃ juhoti kṣatraṃ tatkṛtvā viśaṃ karoti //	And, again, as to why he offers the Vaisvânara and Mârutas,--the Vaisvânara is the ruling power (chieftaincy), and the Mârutas are the clan: he thus sets up both the chief and the clan. The Vaisvânara he offers first: thus, having set up the chief, he sets up the clan.
eka eṣa bhavati / ekasthaṃ tatkṣatramekasthāṃ śriyaṃ karoti bahava itare viśi tadbhūmānaṃ dadhāti //	The former is a single (oblation): he thus makes the ruling power (chieftaincy) to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.
nirukta eṣa bhavati / niruktamiva hi kṣatramaniruktā itare 'nirukteva hi viṭ tiṣṭhannetaṃ juhoti tiṣṭhatīva hi kṣatramāsīna itarānāsta iva hi viṭ //	The former is (offered in a) distinct (voice), for the ruling power is something distinct, so to speak; and the others are indistinct, for indistinct, so to speak, is the clan. Standing he offers the former, for the ruling power (the chief) stands, so to speak; and sitting (he offers) the others, for the clan sits, so to speak.

Well, the first three feet of those seven-footed Mâruta (verses), being a three-footed Gâyatrî, are the invitatory formula, and the last four, being a four-footed Trishtubh, are the offering-formula. The one is the bowl, and the other the handle (of the offering-ladle), and the Svâhâ-call is the Vashat-call: in this way, then, these (Mâruta oblations) also become offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vashat-call, and with invitatory and offering-formulas.
tadyam prathamaṃ dakṣiṇato mārutaṃ juhoti /	And the first Mâruta (cake) which he offers on the right (south) side, is the seven (rivers) which flow eastwards.

Whenever he here speaks of them as belonging to the Maruts, he makes them food for him (Agni) and offers it to him, and gratifies him thereby.

And everything here is wealth (vasu), for all these (cake-offerings) are (connected with special) wishes ; and in order that this shower, be it of milk or of ghee, (may be) fraught with wealth, this oblation of ghee is thus offered for the beginning; and inasmuch as this shower is fraught with wealth, it is called 'shower of wealth.'

In order to avoid discontinuance, he each time embraces two wishes,--even as one would connect those living away from one another,--thinking, 'In this way shall they prosper by sacrifice!'

Well, this shower of wealth consists of three hundred and sixty (libations), and of (other) six, and of thirty-five. Now, the three hundred and sixty which there are,--so many being the days in the year,--thereby it obtains the days of the year. And what six there are,--the seasons beingsix in number,--thereby it obtains the nights of the seasons: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And what thirty-five there are, they are the (intercalary) thirteenth month , and that is the body,--the body (consists) of thirty (limbs), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and up-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year; and thus that shower of wealth of his obtains (conformity with) the year, and Agni; and thus it corresponds to the year, to Agni. And so many are the bricks with special formulas which are placed in the centre of a Sândila fire-altar; for these bricks indeed are the same as these different Agnis ; and thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the shower of wealth.

Well, the first nine formulas of this shower of wealth are the threefold head; and the forty-eight which follow are the twenty-four-fold wings ; and the twenty-five which follow are the twenty-five-fold body ; and the twenty-one which follow are the tail, as the twenty-first ; and thethirty-five which follow are the Vasa (hymn); and by the eighties (of verses) which follow those eighties (Of the mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties the Great Litany is counted; and what there is after the eighties, that to him (corresponds to) what, in the Great Litany, there is after the eighties ; and thus this shower of wealth of his attains to (conformity with) the Great Litany, and corresponds to the Great Litany.

Let him set aside one of these kinds of food, and not eat thereof as long as he lives. With an udumbara (ficus glomerata) cup and an udumbara dipping-spoon (he offers): the significance of these two has been explained. They are both four-cornered,--there are four quarters: he thus gratifies him with food from every quarter, and by means of food from every quarter he thus consecrates him.

Thus when he offers in the fire he consecrates Agni, and when he offers to these deities, he gratifies those gods who rule over this consecration ceremony.

They were indeed consecrated on this occasion by all the rites of consecration; and in like manner is the Sacrificer on this occasion consecrated by all the rites of consecration.

And what other seven there are, they belong to Agni (or, the Agnikayana): by offering these, he is consecrated by the Agni-consecration.

On the hairy side (of the skin),--for the hairs are the metres: on the metres he thus anoints him. On the left (north) side (of the fire-altar he anoints him): the significance of this (will be explained) further on.

But let him not do so, for that (southern) region belongs to the Fathers, and quickly he goes to that region whom they anoint in that way.

But let him not do so, for that (Âhavanîya, the fire-altar,) is his (the Sacrificer's)divine body, and this (Sacrificer, or Sacrificer's real body) is his human one: they thus attach that divine body of his to this his mortal body, if they anoint him in this way.

On a he-goat's skin should be anointed one desirous of prosperity, on a black-antelope skin one desirous of spiritual lustre, on both (kinds of skins) one desirous of both: that (skin) he spreads north of the tail (of the fire-altar) with its hair uppermost and its neck-part towards the east.

Impelled by Savitri, he thus anoints him by all this support of Sarasvatî Vâk, the supporter, and by the universal sovereignty of Agni.

Six he offers before, and six after (the consecration ceremony), for there are six seasons: by the seasons he thus encloses (guards) him who is consecrated on both sides. Brihaspati is the last of the first (six ), and Indra the first of thelast (six),--Brihaspati is the priesthood (or priestly office), and Indra is the nobility (or political power): by the priesthood and the nobility he thus encloses him who is consecrated on both sides.

And inasmuch as the kings sustain realms, and these gods are kings, therefore Realm-sustaining (oblations are performed).

' 'O ye gods, what lights of yours are in the sun. . . '--'Bestow thou light upon our priests, (work thou light in our kings, light in our people and Sûdras, bestow light upon me by thy light)!' He thus says 'light' each time,--light is immortality: it is immortality he thus bestows upon him.

With a verse addressed to Varuna (he offers): he thus gratifies him by his own self, by his own deity.

With a verse addressed to Varuna (he offers),--Varuna is the ruling power, and ruling power means strength: it is thus by strength that he bestows strength upon him.

svarṇa gharmaḥ svāheti / asau vā ādityo gharmo 'muṃ tadādityamasminnagnau pratiṣṭhāpayti //	, 'Heaven-like heat, hail!'--the heat, doubtless, is yonder sun; he thus establishes yonder sun in Agni.

Moreover, by naming them, he thus places them on this fire-altar.

tadāhuḥ / na juhuyānnedatirecayānīti sa vai juhuyādeva kāmebhyo vā etā āhutayo hūyante na vai kāmānāmatiriktamasti //	As to this they say, 'Let him not offer (any additional oblations), lest he should do what is excessive.'

They are the clansmen, and the built-up fire-altar is the chieftaincy: he thus sets up both the chieftaincy and the clan. The former (altar) he builds up first, then these (hearths): thus he sets up the clan after setting up the chieftaincy.
eka eṣa bhavati / ekasthaṃ tatkṣatramekasthāṃ śriyaṃ karoti bahava itare viśi tadbhamānaṃ dadhāti //	That (fire-altar) is a single one: he thus makes the chieftaincy to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.

Upwards he builds that one: he thus builds the ruling power upward by (social) layers; sideways the others: he thus makes the clan obedient to the chieftain from below.

And when he builds up these (hearths) only with the space-filling one, the Lokamprinâ being the nobility --he thereby places the chieftain, as the eater, among the clan. He builds up (dhishnya-hearths) both of the Soma-sacrifice , and of the fire-altar; first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained.

The variegated stone is the ninth of them: there are nine vital airs--seven in the head and two downward ones--it is these he thus puts into it. The fire which is placed on the erected (hearth) is the tenth;--there are ten vital airs , and the Âgnîdhra is the middle (between the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fires).: he thus puts the vital airs in the middle of it; for the vital airs, being in the middle of the body, move along it in this direction, and in that direction.
ekaviṃśatiṃ hotrīya upadadhāti /	Twenty-one he places on the Hotrîya (hearth), and there are twenty-one enclosing-stones : the significance of this has been explained.

This one lies to the south of those (other hearths) ,--this (Âgnîdhrîya) he lays down in this way (direction), and these (other hearths) in this way, and that one (the Fire-altar) in this way: he thereby makes the peasantry look towards the chieftain.

As many bricks with special formulas asthere are (in each hearth) so many enclosing-stones there are (in each); for with that (fire-altar) there are as many enclosing-stones as there are such bricks in it : he thus makes the clan obedient and subservient to the chief. He then scatters a layer of earth on (each of) these (hearths): the significance of this has been explained .

There are (in that case) ten (oblations),--the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables, and Agni is virâg (far-shining, or far-ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.

And inasmuch as these deities are consecrated (quickened) by this consecration ceremony and quicken him for this consecration, they are (called) the Divine Quickeners.

And whatsoever oblation he offers after the Pasupurodâsa (the cake-offering connected with the animal sacrifice), that is placed inside the animal victim itself as its sacrificial sap . He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the fire-altar (or Agnikayana), first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar the purport of this has been explained. In a loud voice the Pasupurodâsa offering (is performed), in a low voice these (additional oblations), for they are an ishti . With the Pasupurodâsa he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with these (oblations), 'Recite!--Worship ' for they are an ishti.

Now when he offers in the fire he thereby consecrates (anoints) Agni, and that divine body of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality.

The oblation (âhuti) is the tenth of those , and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. On that occasion he offers the oblation continuously so as not to stop the seed, the sacrifice there being seed;--on this occasion (he offers) with the dipping-spoon at the Svâhâ-call, for manifest is the seed when it is born.

Having stood by the fire, and lifted it, and churned it out, he offers the completing oblation .

Now, were he to have intercourse with a human woman without having offered this (oblation), it would be a descent, as if one who is divine would become human; but when he offers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna, he thereby approaches a divine mate : having offered it, he may freely have intercourse in a befitting way.

Now that Pragâpati who became released is this very fire-altar which is here being built; and the seed which fell from him is this dish of clotted curds of Mitra and Varuna; for Mitra and Varuna are the in-breathing and up-breathing, and the in-breathing and up-breathing fashion the infused seed. A dish of clotted curds it is, because seed is milk; and sacrifice it is, because sacrifice is the seed of sacrifice.

But, surely, he who kills a human embryo, is despised, how much more then he who kills him (Agni), for he is a god: 'Let no one become an officiating priest for an (Agni) who has not been carried about for a year,' said Vâtsya, 'lest he should be a participator in the killing of this, a god's seed !'

If he were to recite the Great Litany on one not carried for a year, he should recite (only) the eighties of verses, for something incomplete is (the Agni) not carried for a year, and something incomplete are the eighties of verses . But, indeed, he would only still further pull asunder that (Agni, already) pulled asunder ; and, indeed, whether he (Agni) be carried for a year, or not carried for a year, he (the Hotri) should recite the whole of the Great Litany.

And, indeed, as the breath, he enters into the infused seed, and takes possession of it; and inasmuch as he takes possession (vid) of every one that is born (gâta), he is Gâtavedas. Wherefore by all means let even one who knows this build him as one ever carried (within him). And, indeed, if one who knows this either drinks (Soma), or offers drink to any one else, these libations of his will be offered even as would be his libations, when offered on a complete Sândila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.

And, indeed, after building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to get into trouble, or to stumble, or what not. Now, when Syâparna Sâyakâyana heard this, he ventured upon this performance.

And whatever wish there is in that anushtubh verse , that he secures even now; and, moreover, he thereby keeps off the fiends, the Rakshas, from this sacred work, and they do not wreck him, whilst uttering imprecations. Wherefore one who knows this may readily build a fire-altar even for an enemy, for he is able to gain the better of him.

Whoever performs these (three rites) for anotherperson causes these oceans to dry up for himself, and after them, thus drying up, the metres dry up for him; and after the metres the world; and after the world his own self; and after his own self his children and cattle: indeed, he who performs these for another person becomes poorer day after day.

And that vital fluid (essence) of his which flowed upwards (became) the Great Litany: it is in quest of that vital fluid that (the priests) go by means of the Rik and Sâman. And when the Yagus marches in front in this (quest) , it is in order to fetch something that that (Veda) goes--even as (one might say), 'That one thing there is mine, I will fetch it,' so does that Yagus go in front (or forward).

The Udgâtri puts the vital fluid into it by means of the (sâman of the) Great Rite (mahâvrata ); but, indeed, the (sâman of the) Great Rite is (equivalent to) all these (other) sâmans (hymn-tunes): it is thus by means of all the hymn-tunes that he puts the vital fluid therein. The Hotri puts the vital fluid therein by means of the Great Litany; but, indeed, the Great Litany is the same as all these rik (hymn-verses) : it is thus by means of all the hymn-verses that he puts the vital fluid into it (the Soma-cup).

For, indeed, they do not see it to be the Great Rite that lies there being praised, nor the Great Litany, but it is Agni alone they see; for Agni is the self (body), and thus those two, the Rik and the Sâman, enter him in the form of the vital fluid; and thus they both enter (join) the Yagus.
sa eṣa mithuno'gniḥ prathamā ca citirdvitīyā ca tṛtīyā ca caturthī cātha pañcamyai citeryaścite'gnirnidhīyate tanmithunam mithuna u evāyamātmā //	Now, that Agni (fire-altar) consists of pairs--the first layer and the second, and the third and fourth; and of the fifth layer the fire which is placed on the built (altar) is the mate. And, indeed, this body consists of pairs.
aṅguṣṭhā iti pumāṃsaḥ aṅgulaya iti striyaḥ karṇāviti pumāṃsau bhruvāviti striyā oṣṭhāviti pumāṃsau nāsike iti striyau dantā iti pumāṃso jihveti strī sarva eva mithunaḥ so'nena mithunenātmanaitam mithunamagnimapyeti //	The thumbs (and great toes, 'aṅgushtha,' m.) are males, and the fingers and toes ('aṅguli,' f.) females; the ears ('karna' m.) are males, and the eyebrows ('bhrû,' f.) females; the lips ('oshtha,' m.) are males, and the nostrils ('nâsikâ,' f.) females; the teeth ('danta,' m.) are males, and the tongue ('gihvâ,' f.) is a female: indeed the whole (body) consists of pairs, and with this body, consisting of pairs, that (vital fluid) enters this Agni (the fire-altar), consisting of pairs .
eṣātrāpītiḥ apyahaivam mithuna itthaṃ ha tvevāpi mithuno vāgeveyaṃ yo'yamagniścito vācā hi cīyate'tha yaścite'gnirnidhīyate sa prāṇaḥ prāṇo vai vāco vṛṣā prāṇo mithunaṃ vāgvevāyamātmātha ya ātmanprāṇastanmithunaṃ so'nena mithunenātmanaitam mithunamagnimapyeti //	This, then, is the entering therein;--even thus, indeed, he (Agni) consists of pairs ; but in thisway also he consists of pairs:--the fire-altar here built up is no other than this speech, for with speech it is built up; and the fire which is placed on the built (altar) is the breath; and the breath ('prâna,' m.) is the male, the mate, of speech ('vâk,' f.). And, indeed, this body is speech; and the breath which is in the body is its mate: with this mated body that (vital fluid) thus enters into the mated Agni.
eṣo atrāpītiḥ na ha vā asyāputratāyai kā cana śaṅkā bhavati ya evametau mithunāvātmānaṃ cāgniṃ ca vedānnaṃ ha tvevāyamātmā dakṣiṇānnaṃ vanute yo na ātmeti hyapyṛṣiṇābhyuktam //	This also is the entering therein;--there is indeed no fear of him (Agni) being without offspring to whosoever thus knows these two, the body and Agni, to be a pair; but, indeed, this body is food, as is said by the Rishi , 'The Dakshinâ winneth food which is our own self (breath).'

Now that which enters this (earth) enters the fire-altar built here; and that which enters the air enters that fire which is placed on the built (altar). This also is the entering therein.

He saw this bird-like body, the Fire-altar: hefashioned it, and thereby gained this (terrestrial) world. He saw a second bird-like body, the (chant of the) Great Rite : he fashioned it, and thereby gained the air. He saw a third bird-like body, the Great Litany : he fashioned it, and thereby gained the sky.

Thus with regard to the deity.
athādhyātmam mana evāgniḥ prāṇo mahāvrataṃ vāṅmahadukthaṃ tasmādetāni sarvāṇi sahopeyātsaha hi manaḥ prāṇo vāktadyadagniḥ prathamaścīyate mano hi prathamam prāṇānām //	Now with regard to the body. The Fire-altar is the mind, the (chant of the) Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake together, for mind, breath, and speech belong together; as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because the mind is prior to the breathings.
ātmaivāgniḥ prāṇo mahāvrataṃ vāṅ mahadukthaṃ tasmādetāni sarvāṇi sahopeyātsaha hyātmā prāṇo vāktadyadagniḥ prathamaścīyata ātmā hi prathamaḥ sambhavataḥ sambhavati // śira evāgniḥ prāṇo mahāvratamātmā mahadukthaṃ tasmādetāni sarvāṇi sahopeyātsaha hi śiraḥ prāṇa ātmā tadyadagniḥ prathamaścīyate śiro hi prathamaṃ jāyamānasya jāyate tasmādyatraitāni sarvāṇi saha kriyante mahadevokthamātamāṃ khyāyata ātmā hi mahaduktham //	The Fire-altar, indeed, is the body (trunk), the Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake together, for body, breath, and speech belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is produced the trunk is produced first. The Fire-altar, indeed, is the head, the Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany the body:one ought therefore to undertake all these together, for head, breath, and body belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is born the head is born first; and hence, whenever all these are undertaken together the Great Litany, indeed, is accounted the highest (âtamâm) , for the Great Litany is the body (or self, âtman).
tadāhuḥ yadetāni sarvāṇi saha durupāpāni kaiteṣāmupāptiriti jyotiṣṭoma evāgniṣṭome jyotiṣṭomenaivāgniṣṭomena yajeta //	As to this they say, 'If all these are difficult to obtain together, what (means of) obtaining them is there?'--In the Gyotishtoma (form of the) Agnishtoma : let him perform offering with the Gyotishtoma Agnishtoma.

Now by the eighties thereof the eighties (of the mahad uktham) are obtained, for the Great Litany is counted (or recited) by eighties (of triplets); and of the forty-five (syllables which remain) twenty-five are this twenty-five-fold body ; and where the body is there, indeed, are (included) the head, and the wings and tail; and the twenty (syllables which remain) are the insertion ;--thus much, then, is the Great Litany: thereby he obtains the Great Litany even in this (Agnishtoma). All these (three) are indeed obtained in the Gyotishtoma Agnishtoma: let him, therefore, perform offering with the Gyotishtoma Agnishtoma.

From the out- (and in-) breathings he created the gods, and from the downward breathings the mortal beings; andabove the (mortal) beings he created Death as their consumer.
tasya ha prajāpateḥ ardhameva martyamāsīdardhamamṛtaṃ tadyadasya martyamāsīttena mṛtyorabibhetsa bibhyādimām prāviśaddvayam bhūtvā mṛccāpaśca //	Now, one half of that Pragâpati was mortal, and the other half immortal: with that part of him which was mortal he was afraid of death; and, being afraid, he became twofold, clay and water, and entered this (earth).

He spake, 'Let us search for him, let us gather him up for I shall not injure him.' The gods gathered him from out of this (earth): that part of him which was in the water, they gathered as water, and that which was in this (earth, they gathered) as clay. Having gathered together both clay and water, they made a brick, whence a brick consists of both clay and water.
tadetā vā asya tāḥ pañca martyāstanva āsaṃloma tvaṅmāṃsamasthi majjāthaitā amṛtā mano vākprāṇaścakṣuḥ śrotram //	And, indeed, these five forms (bodily parts) of him are mortal--the hair on the mouth, the skin, the flesh, the bone, and the marrow; and these are immortal--the mind, the voice, the vital air; the eye, and the ear.
sa yaḥ sa prajāpatiḥ ayameva sa yo'yamagniścīyate'tha yā asya tāḥ pañca martyāstanva āsannetāstāḥ purīṣacitayo'tha yā amṛtā etāstā iṣṭakācitayaḥ //	Now, that Pragâpati is no other than the Fire-altar which is here built up, and what five mortal parts there were of him, they are these layers of earth; and those which were immortal they are these layers of bricks.

Having encompassed that mortal form by those immortal forms of his, they made it immortal--the layer of earth by means of two layers of bricks: in like manner the second, the third, and the fourth (layers of earth).

Thereby, then, Pragâpati became immortal; and in like manner does the Sacrificer become immortal by making that body (of the altar) immortal.

They saw this verse , 'The seat-hiding Agni, Indra, god Brahman, Brihaspati, and the wise All-gods may speed our sacrifice unto bliss!'

The 'seat-hiding' (verse) is an Anushtubh, for the Anushtubh is speech, and the seat-hider is speech: it is by speech that hesecures for him what was not secured for him. 'Let him approach (the altar with this verse) when he has covered a layer with earth,' say some, 'for then that (layer) becomes whole and complete.'

And in like manner is the Sacrificer (composed of) both the mortal and the immortal--his vital airs alone are immortal, his body mortal: by this sacrificial performance, and by this order of proceeding, he makes his body uniformly undecaying and immortal.

He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his marrow, and it is a mortal (element), for the marrow is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his sinews, and it is a mortal (element), for the sinew is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his flesh, and it is a mortal (element), for flesh is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his fat, and it is a mortal (element), for the fat is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his blood and his skin, and it is a mortal (element), for blood is mortal, and skin is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

And in like manner does the Sacrificer now finally make a golden form for his body; and inasmuch as (he does so) finally, this is the final form of his body; and hence, whether they know this or not, people say that the Agnikit (he who has built an altar) is born in yonder world as one made of gold .

By means of the down-breathing men eat food, whence foodis introduced into men (from the front) towards the back, for by their down-breathing men eat food.

Nevertheless, one who knows this may safely eat thereof; for he who builds an altar becomes of Agni's form, and, indeed, all food here belongs to Agni: whosoever knows this will know that all food belongs to him.

Well, he who builds an altar becomes the deity Agni; and Agni (the fire), indeed, is the immortal (element);--the gods are splendour: he enters splendour; the gods are glory: he becomes glorious whosoever knows this.

Then the sâmans he sings around the built (altar) are the Mahâvrata(-sâman); the Udgâtri's preliminary muttering (of the text of his chants) on that occasion is the Satarudriya; the 'shower of wealth' the Great Litany; and what takes place subsequent to (the singing of) the sâmans, and prior to the shower of wealth, that is the Hotri's preliminary muttering on that occasion; and what takes place after the shower of wealth is the Grihamedhas (house-sacrifices). Such are all the sacrifices: these he secures by (building) the fire-altar.

Verily, he who (regularly) performs the Agnihotra eats food in the evening and in the morning (when he comes to be) in yonder world, for so much sustenance is there in that sacrifice. And he who performs the New and Full-moon sacrifice (eats food) every half-month; and he who performs the Seasonal sacrifice (does so) every four months; and be who performs the animal sacrifice (twice a year, eats food) every six months; and the Soma-sacrificer once a year; and the builder of the fire-altar at his pleasure eats food every hundred years, or abstains therefrom ; for a hundred years is as much as immortality , unending and everlasting: and, verily, for him who knows this, there shall thus be immortality, unending and everlasting; and whatever he as much as touches, as it were, with a reed, shall be for him immortal, unending and everlasting.

He saw this bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly up, without contracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so. By contracting and expanding (the wings) he did fly up: whence even to this day birds can only fly up when they contract their wings and spread their feathers.

Now these, to wit, the fingers, are his lowest measure: he thus secures for him (the sacrificial man ) that lowest measure of his, and therewith he thus measures him.

He contracts (the right wing) inside on bothsides by just four finger-breadths, and expands it outside on both sides by four finger-breadths: he thus expands it by just as much as he contracts it; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its proper size) nor does he make it too small. In the same way in regard to the tail, and in the same way in regard to the left wing.

In one-third (of each wing he makes them), for the bending-limbs are in one-third of the bird's wings;--in the inner third , for the bending-limbs are in the inner third of a bird's wings. He expands (each of these limbs) in front by just four finger-breadths, and contracts it behind by four finger-breadths; he thus expands it by just as much as he contracts it; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its size), nor does he make it too small.

He then makes the wings crooked, for a bird's wings are crooked; he expands them behind by just four finger-breadths, and contracts them in front by four finger-breadths : he thus draws them out byjust as much as he draws them in; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its size) nor does he make it too small.

This Agni had now been completely restored, and the gods conferred upon him this highest form; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) confer upon him this highest form: he makes a thousand bricks marked with straight lines, a thousand marked this way (from left to right), and a thousand marked that way (from right to left).

He produced living beings (or offspring), and having produced living beings he went upwards,--he went to that world where that (sun) now shines. And, indeed, there was then no other (victim) meet for sacrifice but that one (Pragâpati), and the gods set about offering him up in sacrifice.

And what (space) there is over and above that when he is raised on the forepart of his foot, that he secures by the enclosing-stones; and hence heshould dig a line for the enclosing-stones outside (the altar-ground).

And the wings are (the bird's) arms, and by means of the arms food is eaten: it is thus for the sake of food that he gives them that space; and when he gives two cubits to the two wings, it is because food is taken from the distance of a cubit.

But, indeed, so much does this (the bird's wing) measure, and so much this (the bird's tail), and hence when he thus measures them, it is for the sake of securing for him that (natural measure).

Having fixed upon (the place for) the sacrificial ground, he enters the Patnîsâla by the front (east) door, and having thrown up (the ground) for the Gârhapatya, he sprinkles it with water. From the raised (site) of the Gârhapatya he strides seven steps eastward. From there he measures off a fathom towards the east, and having, in the middle thereof, thrown up (the ground) for the Âhavanîya, he sprinkles it with water.

And that (space of a) fathom which was (marked off), is the womb of the Gârhapatya , for it was from that womb that the gods begat the Gârhapatya; and from the Gârhapatya the Âhavanîya.

This, then, is the Vedi measuring ninety steps: thereon he lays out the sevenfold Fire-altar.

Well, there are theseten vital airs in a man , four limbs, and the trunk as the fifteenth; in the same way in the second, and in the same way in the third (man),--in six men this makes ninety; and one man remains over. Now, (that seventh) man is fivefold--hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow (fat), and this Vedi also is fivefold--the four regions (quarters), and the body (of the altar) as the fifth : thus this sevenfold (altar) does indeed correspond to this Vedi.

As large as this Vedi of the sevenfold (fire-altar) is, fourteen times as large he measures out the Vedi of the one hundred and one-fold (altar).

Twenty-eight man's lengths long (from west to east) and twenty-eight man's lengths across is the body (of the altar), fourteen man's lengths the right, and fourteen the left wing, and fourteen the tail. Fourteen cubits (aratni) he covers (with bricks) on the right, and fourteen on the left wing, and fourteen spans (vitasti) on the tail. Such is the measure of (an altar of) ninety-eight man's lengths with the additional space (for wings and tail).

He then measures one three cubits long, and lays it sevenfold: of this he covers (the space of) three parts on the right, and three on the left wing, and leaves four (parts) free.

In this way does this one hundred and one-fold (Agni) correspond to this Vedi.

Well, what right proportions there were in the case of that seventh man's length , these same proportions (also apply) to all these (redundant man's lengths).

He went on constructing (developing) his body, and stopped at the one hundred and one-fold one. He who constructs one lower than a sevenfold one cuts this Father Pragâpati in twain: he will be the worse for sacrificing as one would be by doing injury to his better. And he who constructs one exceeding the one hundred and one-fold one steps beyond this universe, for Pragâpati is this universe. Hence he should first construct the sevenfold (altar), then the next higher up to the one hundred and one-fold one, but he should not construct one exceeding the one hundred and one-foldone, and thus, indeed, he neither cuts this Father Pragâpati in twain, nor does he step beyond this universe.

This Pragâpati, the year, desired, 'May I build up for myself a body so as to contain Agni, all objects of desire.' He constructed a body one hundred and one-fold; and in constructing a body one hundred and one-fold, he built up for himself a body so as to contain Agni, all objects of desire, and himself became all objects of desire; there was not one object of desire outside of him: whence they say, 'The year (includes) all objects of desire;' for, indeed, outside the year there is no object of desire whatever.

And in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in the seven worlds of the gods by constructing for himself a body a hundred and one-fold.

And thus, indeed, the sevenfold (altar) passes into the one hundred and one-fold: that which is a hundred and one-fold is sevenfold, and that which is sevenfold is a hundred and one-fold.

And the Upasads also are the fervour in the sacrifice, for they are indeed fervour; and inasmuch as it is built (ki) in fervour (tapas) it is called 'Tâpaskita .'

Hence one ought not to yield to his own desire and pass away before (he has attained) the full extent of life, for (such shortening of one's life) does not make for the heavenly world ; and these are indeed the worlds, to wit, the days and nights, the half-moons, moons, and seasons, and the year.

Whatever food there is in the year, that is its food; whatever water, that is its drink; its well-being is the night, for in the night, as in well-being (contentment or goodness), all beings dwell together ; its light is the day, and its immortal element the sun. Thus much as to the deity.

Whatever food is placed on the fire, that is its food, and whatever water, that is its water; its well-being is the enclosing-stones, for they are of the nature of nights ; its light the (bricks) with special formulas, for they are of the nature of days; and its immortalelement the fire, for that is of the nature of the sun. Thus much as to the sacrifice.

Whatever food there is in man, that is his food; whatever water, that is his water; his well-being (safety, strength) is the bones, for they are of the nature of enclosing-stones; his light the marrow, for that is of the nature of the yagushmatî (bricks); his immortal element the breath, for that is of the nature of fire;--and, indeed, people say, 'The breath is fire, the breath is the immortal.'

And let him hold this to be immortality in yonder world and life here below. Some, indeed, hold it to be breath, saying, 'The breath is fire, the breath is the immortal;' but let him not believe this, for something uncertain is breath. And regarding this it has also been said in the Yagus , 'That (bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of Âyus (life):' let him therefore hold it to be immortality in yonder world, and life here below, and thus, indeed, he attains the whole life.

The metre (of the verse) wanting a syllable (or syllables) and that deity, the waters, are the defective and redundant parts.

Thus much as to the body.

And when the sun sets it enters the wind, and so does the moon; and the quarters are established in the wind, and from out of the wind they issue again. And when he who knows this passes away from this world, he passes into the fire by his speech, into the sun by his eye, into the moon by his mind, into the quarters by his ear, and into the wind by his breath; and being composed thereof, he becomes whichever of these deities he chooses, and is at rest.

And the 'yat' (that which goes) is this (Adhvaiyu) , for when he 'goes' on (performing), the Rik and Sâman carry that Yagus established on the Rik and Sâman. Hence the Adhvaryu performs his work with the very same Grahas (cups of Soma), (while) there are each time different stotras (chants) and sastras (recitations): it is just as if, after driving with a first pair (of horses), one drives with a second pair.

Such is the Yagus with the preparatory performance (puraskarana ) as regards the deities.

And food carries along that Yagus established on food, whence even different food is introduced into the same (channel of the) breath.

Such is the Yagus with the preparatory performance, firmly established both as regards the deity and the body; and, indeed, whosoever thus knows this Yagus with the preparatory performance to be firmly established both as regards the deity and the body,--

Wherefore, if any one would be greater than he, let him reverentially approach the regions in front (to the eastward) of that one in this way, and he will do him no injury .

Wherefore, if one desire to invoke any blessing from the gods, let him approach them with this, 'Your soul is joy,--my wish is such and such: let it be fulfilled unto me!' and whatever the wish he entertains, it will be fulfilled to him; for, assuredly, he who knows this attains this contentment, this successful issue, this joy, this soul.

Silently the Adhvaryu draws the cup of Soma with the (muttered) Yagus, and, when drawn and deposited, it becomes manifest;--silently he builds the fire-altar with the Yagus, and, when built and completed, it becomes manifest;--silently he takes out (material for) the oblation with the Yagus, and, when cooked and ready (for offering), it becomes manifest: thus, whatever he performs silently, when performed and completed, it becomes manifest. And, assuredly, he who thus knows this secret manifestation of this (Yagus) becomes manifest in fame, and glory, and sanctity; and quickly, indeed, he becomes known: he becomes the Yagus itself, and by the Yagus people call him .

In the course of a year he prepares for it (his self) this food, to wit, the fire-altar here built, and encloses it in a body, and, being enclosed in a body, it becomes the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.

And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this vrata (rite) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata (sâman) in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food,--that (combined) makes the Uktha (sastra, recitation) in respect of the Rik.

When created, the two were separate. They spake, 'Whilst being thus, we shall be unable to produce creatures (people): let us both become one form!' The two became one form.

They are made of gold: gold means light, and Indra and Agni are the light; gold means immortal life, and Indra and Agni mean immortal life.

Whatever is of brick that is Agni: whence they bake that (part) by fire, and all that is baked by fire is Agni. And what filling of earth there is (in the altar) that. is Indra: whence they do not bake that (part) by fire, lest it should be Agni, and not Indra. Thus it is these two, Indra and Agni, that are built up.

Now Agni, indeed, is this single brick , and into this the whole Agni passes: this, indeed, is the perfection of bricks,--it is that one syllable (akshara) 'vauk,' it is this into which the whole Agni passes, and which is the perfection of syllables.

But the Visve Devâh (the All-gods) are also the peasantry: hence it is Priesthood, Nobility, and Peasantry.

The Udgâtri (chanter), by the Mahâvrata (sâman), puts flavour (vital sap) into it; and the Mahâvrata (sâman) being (composed of) all those (five) sâmans, he thus puts flavour into it by means of all sâmans (hymn-tunes). The Hotri puts flavour into it by means of the Great Recitation; and the Great Recitation being (composed of) all those Rik-verses: he thus puts flavour into it by all the Rik-verses.

Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and 'shat' this sixfold food : having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to his body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.

Now what a digit is to men that a syllable (akshara) is to the gods.

They also built a fire-altar,--they laid downunlimited enclosing-stones; unlimited Yagushmatî (bricks), unlimited Lokamprinâ (bricks), even as some lay them down to this day, saying, 'The gods did so.' They did not attain immortality. They went on praising and toiling, striving to win immortality.

They spake, 'Henceforward no one shall be immortal with the body: only when thou shalt have taken that (body) as thy share, he who is to become immortal either through knowledge, or through holy work, shall become immortal after separating from the body.' Now when they said, 'either through knowledge or through holy work,' it is this fire-altar that is the knowledge, and this fire-altar that is the holy work.

Of these, he lays down twenty-one in the Gârhapatya (altar), seventy-eight in the Dhishnya-hearths, and the others in the Âhavanîya. So many, indeed, are the (different) forms of the year: it is these that are here secured for him (Pragâpati, the Year), and are put on him.

But let him not do so. There are, indeed, ten of these fire-altars he builds--eight Dhishnyas, the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya--whence they say, 'Agni is Virâg (wide shining or ruling),' for the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables: but, surely, all these (altars and hearths) are looked upon as only one, as Agni; for it is merely forms of him that they all are,--even as the days and nights, the half-moons, the months, and the seasons (are forms) of the year, so are they all forms of him (Agni).

Surely, on the Âgnîdhrîya he places the variegatedstone , and that he takes into account: why, then, taking that into account, should he not take others into account? That (altar) by which they ward off Nirriti , evil, is the eleventh.
tadāhuḥ kathamu tā atra na sampaśyatīti na hyenā abhijuhotyāhutyā vā iṣṭakā sarvā kṛtsnā bhavatīti //	As to this they say, 'Why, then, do they not take into account here those (of Nirriti's altar)?' Because he makes no offering on them, for it is by offering that a brick becomes whole and complete.

Well, these (bricks) are his (Agni's) vital power, and man's vital power is not excessive. Thus whosoever, knowing this, performs this holy work, or he who but knows this, makes up this Pragâpati whole and complete.

They who thus know this Agni as being endowed with a thousand, know his one-thousandth digit; but they who do not thus know him, do not even know a one-thousandth digit of him. And he alone who so knows this, or who performs this sacred work, obtains this whole and complete Pragâpatean Agni whom Pragâpati obtained. Wherefore let him who knows this by all means practise austerities ; for, indeed, when he who knows this practises austerities, even to (abstention from) sexual intercourse, every (part) of him will share in the world of heaven .

Let him know, then, that Agni is the Year; and let him know that it is thereof he consists.

Even thus, then, it is threefold; but in this respect also it is threefold, inasmuch as three kinds of bricks are put into it--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names; and these limbs of men also are of three kinds--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names. This body (of the altar), indeed, is threefold; and with this threefold body he obtains the threefold divine Amrita (nectar, immortality).

Therefore he 'settles' all (the bricks) with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvâ, f.)!' not with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvah, m.)!' or with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvam, n.)!' for it is that Speech he is constructing.

Thus in regard to the deity.

And after the consummation of the sacrifice it rises upwards and enters that shining (sun): one need not therefore mind destroying Agni, for he is then in yonder (world) . Thus, then, in regard to the sacrifice.

Moreover, this man (or person) in the left eye is the mate of that one (in the right eye and in the sun); and a mate is one half of one's own self , for when one is with a mate he is whole and complete: thus it (the second man) is for the sake of completeness. And as to there being two of these (persons in the eyes), a pair means a productive couple: hence two Lokamprinâs are laid down each time , and hence they set up the layer by two (kinds of bricks).

And one should not therefore forcibly awaken him who sleeps, lest he should hurt those two deities whilst enjoying their union; and hence the mouth of him who has been asleep is, as it were, clammy, for those two deities are then shedding seed, and from that seed everything here originates, whatsoever exists.

These vital airs (prâna) are his own (sva); and when he sleeps (svapiti) thenthese vital airs take possession of him as his own (svâ api-yanti): hence (the term) 'svâpyaya (being taken possession of by one's own people),' 'svâpyaya' doubtless being what they mystically call 'svapna (sleep),' for the gods love the mystic.

Whilst being one only, he (the man in the eye) is numerously distributed among living beings: whence the Lokamprinâ (representing the man in the sun), whilst being one only (in kind), extends over the whole altar; and because he (the man in the eye) is one only, therefore (the Lokamprinâ) is one.

The year is the body of the sacrificial horse, the sky its back, the air its belly, the earth the under part of its belly, the quarters its flanks, the intermediate quarters its ribs, the seasons its limbs, the months and half-months its joints, the days and nights its feet, the stars its bones, the welkin its flesh, the sand its intestinal food, the rivers its bowels, the mountains its liver and lungs, the herbs and trees its hair, the rising sun the forepart, and the setting sun the hindpart of its body, the lightning its yawning, the thundering its whinnying, the raining its voiding urine, and speech its voice. The day, indeed, was produced as the Mahiman (cup) before the horse, and its birthplace is in the eastern sea. The night was produced as the Mahiman (cup) behind (or after) it, and its birth-place was in the western sea: these two Mahiman (cups), indeed, came to be on both sides of the horse.

He created for himself this mind, thinking, 'May I have a soul.' He went on worshipping. Whilst he was worshipping the waters were produced. 'Verily, to me worshipping (ark) water (kam) has been produced,' thus (he thought): this, indeed, is the Arka-nature of the Arkya ; and, verily, there is joy (kam) for him who thus knows the Arka-nature of the Arkya.

Thereon he wearied himself, and the glow and essence (sweat) of him thus wearied and heated developed into Fire.

The eastern quarter was his head, this and that (intermediate quarters) are his fore-feet, the western quarter his tail, this and that (intermediate quarters) his thighs, the southern and northern quarters his flanks; the sky his back, the air his belly, and this (earth) his chest:--on the waters he was established any and everywhere, and so indeed is he established who knows this.

By his mind he entered into union with speech,--(to wit) Death with hunger: the seed which was produced became the year, for theretofore there was no year. For as long as the year he (Death) carried him (within him), and at the end ofthat time he produced him . He opened his mouth (to devour) the new-born one, and he (the child) cried 'bhân'; thus speech was produced.

By that speech and that soul of his he created all this (universe) whatsoever there is,--Rik (hymn-verses), Yagus (formulas), Sâman (hymn-tunes), metres, sacrifices, men, and beasts. And whatsoever he created he set about devouring; and because he eats (ad) everything, hence the name 'Aditi'; and, verily, he who thus knows the nature of Aditi becomes an eater of everything, and all food becomes his.

He wearied himself and practised austerity. From him, thus wearied and heated, glory and vigour departed; and glory and vigour, indeed, are the vital airs. The vital airs having departed, that body of his began to swell.

Thereupon the horse (asva) was produced; and because that which was swelling (asvat) became pure (medhya) therefore the name Asvamedha (belongs to that sacrifice). He, indeed, knows the Asvamedha who thus knows him .

But the Asvamedha, in truth, is he that shines yonder (the sun), and the year is his body. The Arka is this Fire, and these worlds are his bodies. These two are the Arka and Asvamedha; but these, indeed, become again one deity, to wit, Death. And, verily, whosoever knows this, conquers recurrent Death, and Death has no hold on him: Death is his own self; he attains all life, and becomes one of those deities.

Brahman is the self-existent: reverence be to Brahman! Hymn Verily, Pragâpati, the Sacrifice, is the Year: the night of new moon is its gate, and the moon itself is the bolt of the gate.

And if one lays down the fires under a (special) asterism ,--just as if one tried to enter a stronghold, when the gate is closed, in some other way than through the gate, and failed to get inside the stronghold, so it is when one lays down the fires under an asterism: let him therefore not lay down the fires under an asterism.

But, indeed, the new moon is the form of the Agnyâdheya: let him therefore lay down the fires at new moon;--let him perform the preliminary ceremony at full moon, and the initiation ceremony at new moon.

There are these three worlds; these worlds he thus gains by three (oblations); and Pragâpati, indeed, is the fourth beyond these worlds: by the fourth (oblation) he thus gains Pragâpati,--this is that perfection, the sacrifice.

He should then offer for another fifteen years; in these fifteen years there are three hundred and sixty full moons and new moons; and there are in a year three hundred and sixty days it is the days he thus gains, and the year itself he thus gains.

But if he be a performer of the Dâkshâyana sacrifice , he need only offer for fifteen years, for therein that perfection is brought about, since he performs (every month) two Full-moon and two New-moon offerings, and thus that perfection is indeed brought about therein.

Hereby then that oblation comes to be shared by Indra, and so does the sacrifice come to be shared by Indra. And as to why (he offers) with 'To (Indra) Vimridh!' it is that by the Full-moon sacrifice he slays all scorners (mridh), all evil spirits.

Now Aditi is this earth, and she, indeed, is certain and firmly established: thereby, then, that oblation of his becomes certain and firmly established. Such, then, is the reason why he prepares additional oblations; now as to why he should not prepare them.

But inasmuch as every sacrifice belongs to Indra, thereby that oblation of his, and that sacrifice, is already shared in by Indra.

Let him, therefore, not prepare the additional oblations. When, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he afterwards prepares another oblation; and when, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he afterwards prepares another oblation, he rises and defies his malicious enemy; and, indeed, unassailed and undisturbed is the prosperity of him who at full moon performs the Full-moon sacrifice, and at new moon the New-moon sacrifice .

If he offer an additional oblation, let him give a sacrificial fee (to the priests); for no oblation, they say, should be without a dakshinâ; and for the Full and New-moon sacrifices there is that dakshinâ, to wit, the Anvâhârya (mess of rice ).

Now if he (the moon) should rise on (the material for) the oblation being not yet taken out, then that approved (procedure is followed) and the same fasting-observance.

But if he should not care to undergo (again) the fasting-observance, or if (the moon) were to rise over (the material for) the oblation already taken out, then let him do otherwise: having properly cleansed the rice-grains of the husks, he cooks the smaller ones as a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Dâtri (the Giver). And the sour curds (from the milk) milked on the day before (he prepares) for Indra Pradâtri (the Bestower); and those (larger) rice-grains he cooks in boiled fresh milk as a pap for Vishnu Sipivishta (the Bald); for a pap it is whenever rice-grains are thrown (into milk or sour curds).

And as to why (he offers) to Vishnu, the Bald, it is because Vishnu is the sacrifice; and as to why to the Bald (sipivishta),--it is that his missing him whom he sought to secure is the bald part (? sipita) of the sacrifice, hence to the Bald one. And on this occasion he should give (to the priests) as much as he is able to give, for no oblation, they say, should be without a dakshinâ.

But, indeed, he (the moon) is that heavenly dog: he watches the Sacrificer's cattle (to seize them), and that would not be good for cattle if amends were not made to them ; and through fear of that 'down-coming moon ,' as they think him to be,--
cāyāmupasarpanti eteno haitadupatapadācakṣate śvalucitamityetamu haivaitadācakṣate //	And therefore, indeed, people call that burning pain 'svalukita' (dog's clutch);--and therefore they also call that one--

Soma, the food of the gods, indeed, is the moon: at full moon they press him; and in the subsequent half of the month he enters the waters and plants; and, the cattle feeding on the water and the plants, he then during that night (of new moon) collects him from the cattle.

As to this they say, 'What should one do when he has departed from the path of the sacrifice? Should he sacrifice, or should he not sacrifice?' He should certainly sacrifice, for there is no other way out of it: day after day that (moon) rises larger. Having performed offering after the manner of the New-moon sacrifice, he takes out material for an additional offering either on the same, or on the following day.

This, indeed, is the prescribed dakshinâ; but he may give anything else besides, of such other (objects meet for) dakshinâs as may be at his disposal. This, doubtless, is an offering relating to cattle: he may perform it even though (the moon) was not seen (at his New-moon sacrifice).

The waters desired, 'How can we be reproduced?' They toiled and performed fervid devotions , when they were becoming heated, a golden egg was produced. The year, indeed, was not then in existence: this golden egg floated about for as long as the space of a year.

He broke open this golden egg. There was then, indeed, no resting-place: only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for as long as the space of a year.

He said 'bhûh': this (word) became this earth;--'bhuvah': this became this air;--'svah': this became yonder sky. Therefore a child tries tospeak at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Pragâpati tried to speak.

At the end of the (first) year, Pragâpati rose to stand on these worlds thus produced; whence a child tries to stand up at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Pragâpati stood up.

By (the breath of) his mouth he created the gods: the gods were created on entering the sky; and this is the godhead of the gods (deva) that they were created on entering the sky (div). Having created them, there was, as it were, daylight for him; and this also is the godhead of the gods that, after creating them, there was, as it were, daylight (diva) for him.

Even then he smotethem with evil, and owing to this it was that they were overcome; whence people say, 'Not true is that regarding (the fight between) the gods and Asuras which is related partly in the tale and partly in the legend; for it was even then that Pragâpati smote them with evil, and it was owing to this that they were overcome.'

And, verily, whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara ,' is not overcome by any evil which, by magic art, steals upon him (tsar); and whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara,' overcomes against whomsoever he practises magic art.

tā vā etāḥ prajāpateradhi devatā asṛjyantāgnirindraḥ somaḥ parameṣṭhī prājāpatyaḥ //	Now, these are the deities who were created out of Pragâpati,--Agni, Indra, Soma, and Parameshthin Prâgâpatya.

Then Parameshthin, son of Pragâpati, saw that sacrifice, the New and Full-moon offerings, and performed these offerings. Having performed them, he desired, 'Would I were everything here!' He became the waters, for the waters are everything here, inasmuch as they abide in the furthest place; for he who digs here on earth finds indeed water; and, in truth, it is from that furthest place, to wit, from yonder sky that he rains, whence the name Parameshthin (abiding in the furthest, highest place).

He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Pragâpati) desired, 'Would I were everything here!' He became the breath (vital air), for breath is everything here: Pragâpati is that breath which blows here (the wind); and whatsoever knows that it is thus he blows is his (Pragâpati's) eyesight; and whatsoever is endowedwith breath is Pragâpati. And, verily, whosoever thus knows that eyesight of Pragâpati becomes, as it were, manifest,

He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Indra) desired, 'Would that I were everything here!' He became speech (vâk), for speech is everything here; whence they say, 'Indra is Vâk.'

He accordingly performed it for them. Having sacrificed, those two desired, 'Would that we were everything here!' One of them became the eater of food, and the other became food: Agni became the eater of food, and Soma food; and the eater of food, and food, indeed, are everything here.

'Let us improve it from here!'they said, and made it to be strength, 'May we see this strength!' they said; and it became yonder sky .

'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it to be space. 'May we see this space!' they said; and it became this air, for that (air) is space; for even as the resting-place here in this world is clearly the earth, so the resting-place there in yonder world is clearly this air; and because, whilst being here on earth, one does not see that space, therefore people say, 'That space (or, yonder world) is invisible.'

'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it to be prosperity (or distinction). 'May we see this prosperity!' they said; and it became this earth, for this (earth) is indeed (the source of) prosperity; whence he who obtains most therefrom becomes the most prosperous.

'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it (to represent) the law, for the waters are the law: hence whenever the waters come (down) to this (terrestrial) world everything here comes to be in accordance with the law; but whenever there is drought, then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for the waters are the law.

This, then, is the completeness of the New and Full-moon sacrifices as regards the gods.

'He should offer it without drawing breath ,' they say, 'for thus it becomes unfailing for him.'

The invitatory and offering-formulas are (in) measured metre, whence the bones of a fat and a lean person are alike: but inasmuch as he takes now more, now less, offering-material, therefore the flesh of a fat person is fat, and the flesh of a lean person is lean. This sacrifice he performs to any deity he pleases and for whom there is a sacrificial dish.

Other oblations, indeed, are either added to or omitted.

Well, let him, on those two nights (of full and new moon), himself offer the Agnihotra: inasmuch as, after offering, he takes food he does not become consecrated to the Fathers, for that (libation) is an offering; and inasmuch as he performs that offering in his own self he does not eat of those sacrificial essences.

Then the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause of ruin .
atha devāḥ anyo'nyasminneva juhvataścerustebhyaḥ prajāpatirātmānam pradadau yajño haiṣāmāsa yajño hi devānāmannaṃ //	But the gods went on offering unto one another. Pragâpati gave himself up to them, and the sacrifice became theirs; for, indeed, the sacrifice is the food of the gods.

Now when he (the Sacrificer) enters on the fast, he thereby gives himself up to the gods, even as Pragâpati thereby gave himself up to the gods. Let him therefore endeavour to pass that night (with his mind) completely restrained , in the same way as he wouldproceed with (material for) an oblation, for he becomes an oblation to the gods.

He redeems the oblation by the Anvâhârya (mess of rice) ; and because he thereby supplies (anv-â-harati) what is wanting in the sacrifice, therefore it is called Anvâhârya. Thus, then, that entire sacrifice of his comes to be redeemed; and that sacrifice becomes the Sacrificer's self in yonder world. And, verily, the Sacrificer who, knowing this, performs that (offering of) redemption comes into existence in yonder world with a complete body.

And what comes after the kindling-verses that is the foundation: thus, having caused him to be born, he establishes him.

And when there, on the occasion of the throwing (of the grass-bunchinto the fire), birth is spoken of, he thereby causes him to be born a third time: on this occasion the Patnîsamyâgas are the foundation.

Of those eleven (kindling-verses) he recites thrice the first and last:--

And when there, at the Patnîsamyâgas, he takes up at the same time (the two spoons); and the Samishtayagus :--

Thereby, then, those oblations of his come to be supplied with invitatory formulas through those kindling-verses; and through those oblations those invitatory formulas come to be supplied with both offering-formulas and oblations.
gāyatrīmanuvākyāmanvāha tripadā vai gāyatrī traya ime lokā imānevaitallokāndevāḥ pratyaṣṭhāpayan //	He recites a gâyatrî invitatory formula : the gâyatrî consisting of three feet, these worlds being three in number , it is these worlds the gods thereby established.

Two-footed man, then, is established here among cattle.

And the sacrifice, indeed, becomes his body: thus, having become the sacrifice, he is delivered from that death, and all his chief offerings are thereby delivered from that death .

It created the gods; and, having created the gods, it made them ascend these worlds: Agni this (terrestrial) world, Vâyu the air, and Sûrya the sky.

Having gone up to the sphere beyond, it considered, 'How can I descend again into these worlds?' It then descended again by means of these two--Form and Name. Whatever has a name,that is name; and that again which has no name, and which one knows by its form, 'This is (of a certain) form,' that is form: as far as there are Form and Name so far, indeed, extends this (universe).

One of these two is the greater, namely Form; for whatever is Name, is indeed Form; and, verily, he who knows the greater of these two, becomes greater than he whom he wishes to surpass in greatness.

Now, when he makes the libation to Mind --form being mind, inasmuch as it is by mind that one knows, 'This is form'--he thereby obtains Form; and when he makes the libation to Speech--name being speech, inasmuch as it is by speech that he seizes (mentions) the name--he thereby obtains Name;--as far as there are Form and Name, so far, indeed, extends this whole (universe): all this he obtains; and--theall being the imperishable--imperishable merit and the imperishable world thus accrue to him.

Now, when the Rishis were performing the sacrifice, the Gandharvas came nigh to them. They looked on, thinking, 'Here, surely, they have done too much,--here they have done too little.' And when their sacrifice was completed, they pointed it out to them, saying, 'Here, surely, ye have done too much,--here ye have done too little.'

Wherever (in the course of the sacrifice) he has committed any excess, he makes amends for it by doing homage; and wherever he has left anything defective, it ceases to be defective by his saying, 'up to.' In saying, 'Mayest thou complete thy course up to the success of the sacrifice,'--success being whatever in the sacrifice is neither defective nor excessive--he thereby makes amends for both of these (mistakes); and in saying, 'Mayest thou complete thycourse up to mine own right offering,'--right offering being whatever in the sacrifice is neither defective nor excessive--he thereby also makes amends for both of these (mistakes); and thus that sacrifice of his comes to be performed as one that is neither defective nor excessive by whosoever, knowing this, thus touches (the earth): let him therefore touch it just in this way.

The full moon, indeed, is this (earth), for she is, as it were, full; and the new moon is yonder sky, for yonder sky appears (or, is seen), as it were.

This, then, is the theory regarding the full and new moon in respect of the gods.

The full moon is the up-breathing, for it is by the up-breathing that this man is, as it were, filled; and the new moon is the out (and in)-breathing , for this out-breathing appears, as it were: thus, the full and new moon are these two, the eater and the giver of food.

Thus these two are clearly the full and new moon, as regards the body; and inasmuch as on the day of fasting he eats the (food) suitable for eating on the vow, he thereby clearly gratifies these two in regard to the body; and on the morrow (he gratifies them) as gods by sacrifice.

Well, when he makes a libation of ghee to the Mind--the full moon being the Mind--he thereby makes offering to the full moon; and when he makes a libation of ghee to Speech--the new moon being Speech--he thereby makes offering to the new moon: and thus offering is made by him to the full and new moon."

But let him not do this; for Sarasvat is the Mind, and Sarasvatî is Speech; and thus, in making libations of ghee to these two, offering is made by him to the full and new moon: let him therefore not prepare these two messes of rice.

Well, when, on both occasions, he makes those two libations of ghee (to Mind and Speech), then his Full and New-moon offerings become complete; and he goes to the other world after his Full and New-moon offerings are completed, and thus becomes one who has not (merely) uttered the Âgur.

The other (real) horse-sacrifice they indeed perform (only) a year after (the starting offering), but this month (of the Full and New-moon sacrifice), revolving, makes up a year : thus the sacrificial horse comes to be slaughtered for him year after year.

And inasmuch as at the fourth fore-offering he pours together (the ghee ), therefore this ear is, on the inner side, connected by a channel (with the other). The two butter-portions are the eyes: let him know that these are his own eyes.

Let him say, 'The self-offerer;' for a self-offerer, doubtless, is he who knows, 'This my (new) body is formed by that (body of Yagña, the sacrifice), this my (new) body is procured thereby.' And even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so does he free himself from his mortal body, from sin; and made up of the Rik, the Yagus, the Sâman, and of offerings, does he pass on to the heavenly world.

The Sacrificer and his wife--this is one pair: through it his Agnihotra would be possessed of a wife,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks . The calf and the Agnihotra-cow--this is another pair: through it his Agnihotra-cow would become possessed of a male calf,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks. The pot and the coals--this is another pair; the offering-spoon and the dipping-spoon--this is another pair; the Âhavanîya fire and the log--this is another pair; the libation and the Svâhâ-call--this is another pair: these, doubtless, are the six pairs in the Agnihotra; and he who thus knows them, has offspring born to him by pair after pair, by all generations.

He (Death) said, 'Let me have a share in this one also.'--'Only the night on which he shall not bring his fire-wood,' said (the Brahman). On whatever night, therefore, the Brahmakârin does not bring fire-wood, that (night) he passes cutting it off from his own life: therefore the Brahmakârin should bring fire-wood, lest he should pass (his nights) cutting off (as much) from his life.

When a Brâhmana enters on a Brahmakârin's life--

Now, when he brings a log for the fire, he redeems that fourth part of his which is in the fire; and having cleansed it, he takes it to his own self, and it enters him.

And should he find no other woman from whom alms could be begged, he may even beg from his own teacher's wife, and thereafter from his own mother . The seventh (night) should not pass by for him without begging: him who knows this and practises this all the Vedas enter; for, verily, even as the fire shines when kindled, so does he, after bathing, shine, who, knowing this, lives a Brahmakârin's life.

By him a gold coin was offered; for in the time of our forefathers a prize used to be offered by chosen (priests) when driving about, for the sake of calling out the timid to a disputation. Fear then seized the Brâhmanas of the northern people:--

Let him rather do it in this way;--having taken the guhû with both hands, let him lay it down on the upabhrit; there is no question about this: it is good for (securing) cattle and life. Let him take them up without clinking them together,--were he to let them clink together, insecurity of property would befall the Sacrificer: let him, therefore, take them up without clinking them together.

Now that Adhvaryu, doubtless, scatters the Sacrificer's cattle by a thunderbolt, who steps past with his right (foot) when he isabout to call (on the Âgnîdhra) for the Sraushat, and with his left (foot) when he has called for the Sraushat; and that (other) one drives them together for him who steps past with his left (foot) When he is about to call for the Sraushat, and with his right (foot) when he has called for the Sraushat; for he does indeed drive them together for him.

But that (navel is the channel of the) central breathing: let him therefore hold (the spoon) by lowering them to that (breathing).
athāta āśrāvaṇasya ṣaḍu vā āśrāvitāni nyaktiryagūrdhvaṃ kṛpaṇam bahiḥśryantaḥśri //	Now as to calling for the Sraushat : there are six (modes of) calling for the Sraushat,--the descending, the level, the ascending, the feeble, the outward-tending, and the inward-tending.

And the feeble one, indeed, it is when he calls for the Sraushat in a thin, long-drawn, toneless way: if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu has made the Sacrificer feeble, and submissive to his spiteful enemy,' then that would indeed be likely to cone to pass.

And the inward-tending (antah-sri) one, indeed, it is when he closes his lips, and utters his call at a loud, toneful pitch: tone being prosperity, he thereby puts prosperity (srî) inside (antah) himself, and becomes an eater of food (rich).

Now as to the oblation. In this respect, some people, thinking themselves clever, having turned down the spoon eastwards, and poured out the oblation, turn it round and place it over the upabhrit. But let him not do this; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu has made the Sacrificer dependent on, and submissive to, his spiteful enemy,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.

And he, indeed, satisfies them whohaving offered ghee, offers sacrificial portions, and finally again offers ghee thereon: such a one certainly satisfies them; and, these (oblations) having been satisfied, the gods fill gold cups (for him) .

He answered, 'Even now, indeed, art thou worthy (of being instructed), who hast been our Adhvaryu for a year: I will teach thee this even without thybecoming my pupil.' And so, indeed, he taught him that taking up of the two spoons as we have here explained it: hence one ought only to make one who knows this his Adhvaryu, and not one who does not know it.

From him, worn out and heated, Srî (Fortune and Beauty) came forth. She stood there resplendent, shining, and trembling . The gods, beholding her thus resplendent, shining, and trembling, set their minds upon her.

It went away to Ganaka of Videha, and he searched for it in the Brâhmanas versed in the Aṅgas (limbs of the Veda), and found it in Yâgñavalkya. He said, 'A thousand we give thee, O Yâgñavalkya, in whom we have found that Mitravindâ.' He finds (vind) Mitra, and his is the kingdom, he conquers recurring death and gains all life, whosoever, knowing this, performs this sacrifice; or whosoever thus knows it. Now, as to the successful issue of the sacrificial food.

And he who offers with sacrificial food that has fallen (on the ground) enters through the wind-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the wind-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.

Then the Gandharvas said to one another, 'For a long time, indeed, has this Urvasî dwelt among men: devise ye some means how she may come back to us.' Now, a ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch: the Gandharvas then carried off one of the lambs.

And naked, as he was, he sprangup after them: too long he deemed it that he should put on his garment. Then the Gandharvas produced a flash of lightning, and she beheld him naked even as by daylight. Then, indeed, she vanished: 'Here I am back,' he said, and lo! she had vanished . Wailing with sorrow he wandered all over Kurukshetra. Now there is a lotus-lake there, called Anyatahplakshâ: He walked along its bank; and there nymphs were swimming about in the shape of swans .

He thus encloses him on both sides with ambrosia (the drink of immortality), and thus the Brahmakârin suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.

Concerning this they also sing the verse,--'By laying his right hand on (the pupil), the teacher becomes pregnant (with him): in the third (night) he is born as a Brâhmana with the Sâvitrî .' Let him,however, teach a Brâhmana (the Sâvitrî) at once, for the Brâhmana belongs to Agni, and Agni is born at once : therefore, he should teach the Brâhmana at once.

But let him not do so; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (student) has taken away his (the teacher's) speech: he will become dumb;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore teach him that Gâyatrî Sâvitrî. And some recite it to him while he (the student) is standing or sitting on (the teacher's) right side; but let him not do this; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (teacher) has born this (student) sideways, he will become averse to him;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore recite it in a forward (easterly) direction to (the student) looking at him towards the west.

But Svetaketu Âruneya, when eating honey, whilst he was a student, said, 'This honey, in truth, is the remainder (essential part) of the triple science (the Vedas), and he, indeed, who has such a remainder, is an essence.' And, indeed, if a Brahmakârin, knowing this, eats honey, it is just as if he were to utter either a Rik-verse, or Yagus-formula, or a Sâman-tune: let him therefore eat freely of it.

The Hotri recites (the Âsvina-sastra) in a loud voice, and the other (the Maitrâvaruna) repeats (the morning-litany) in a low voice, only just muttering it: in thisway he does not run counter to (the Hotri's) speech by (his own) speech, nor metre by metre.

And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Yagus-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with ambrosia; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment. And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the dialogue, the traditional myths and legends, for his lesson, satisfies the gods by messes of milk and meat; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.

And hence let him at least pronounce either a Rik-verse or a Yagus-formula, or a Sâman-verse, or a Gâthâ, or a Kumbyâ , to ensure continuity of the Vrata .

He desired, 'May I exist, may I be generated.' He wearied himself and performed fervid devotions: from him, thus wearied and heated, the three worlds were created--the earth, the air, and the sky.

He heated these three Vedas, and from them, thus heated, three luminous essences were produced-- 'bhûh' from the Rig-veda, 'bhuvah' from the Yagur-veda, and 'svar' from the Sâma-veda. And with the Rig-veda they then performed the work of the Hotri priest, with the Yagur-veda the work of the Adhvaryu, and with the Sâma-veda the work of the Udgâtri; and what luminous essence there was in the threefold science, therewith the work of the Brahman priest then proceeded.

But if it should not be known (where the mistake has occurred), ye should make offering in the Âhavanîya after utteringrapidly all (the three sacred words ): thus one heals the Rig-veda by the Rig-veda , the Yagur-veda by the Yagur-veda, and the Sâma-veda by the Sâma-veda;--even as one would put together joint with joint , so does he put together (the broken part of the sacrifice) whoever heals it by means of these (three sacred words). But if he heals it in any other way than this, it would be just as if one tried to put together something that is broken with something else that is broken, or as if one were to apply some poison as lotion to a broken part .

Let him reply, 'With that threefold science.'

And the Adâbhya (cup of Soma) is no other than speech. When he draws the Amsu-cup, and then the Adâbhya-cup, he thereby constructs the body of this (sacrifice) and then establishes that speech therein.

atha devāśca ha vā asurāśca ubhaye prājāpatyā aspardhanta ta etasminneva yajñe prajāpatāvaspardhantāsmākamayaṃ syādasmākamayaṃ syāditi //	Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending,--it was for this very sacrifice, for Pragâpati, that they were contending, saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'

They saw this cup of Soma, this Adâbhya, and drew it: they seized upon the (three) Soma-services, and possessed themselves of the whole sacrifice, and excluded the Asuras from the sacrifice.

And the Adâbhyabeing speech, this speech is indestructible, whence also it is (called) Adâbhya; and, verily, in like manner does he who knows this possess himself of the whole sacrifice of his spiteful enemy, and exclude and shut out his spiteful enemy from all participation in the sacrifice.

He does not press this (batch of Soma-plants) lest he should injure speech (or, the voice of the sacrifice), for the press-stone is a thunderbolt, and the Adâbhya is speech.

These doubtless are the divine waters: he thus bestows sap on him (Pragâpati, the sacrifice) by means of both the divine and the human waters which there are.

He breathes over gold : the meaning of this is the same as there (on the occasion of the Amsu).

On that former occasion he possessed himself of the (three) Soma services; he now restores them again, and causes them to be no longer used up; and with them thus restored they perform the sacrifice.

They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this?'--'Yes, there is,' they replied.--'What is it?'--'Thy father knows.'

Thus saying, he mounted his car and drove away.

Yâgñavalkya said, 'We are Brâhmanas, and he is a Râganya: if we were to vanquish him, whom should we say we had vanquished? But if he were to vanquish us, people would say of us that a Râganya had vanquished Brâhmanas: do not think of this!' They approved of his words. But Yâgñavalkya, mounting his car, drove after (the king). He overtook him, and he (the king) said, 'Is it to know the Agnihotra, Yâgñavalkya?'--'The Agnihotra, O king!' he replied. ‘Well, those two libations, when offered, rise upwards: they enter the air, and make the air their offering-fire, the wind their fuel, the sun-motes their pure libation: they satiate the air, and rise upwards therefrom.

The son who is born therefrom is the renascent world: this is the Agnihotra, Yâgñavalkya, there is nothing higher than this.' Thus he spoke; and Yâgñavalkya granted him a boon. He said, 'Let mine be the (privilege of) asking questions of thee when I list, Yâgñavalkya!' Thenceforth Ganaka was a Brahman.

Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pasubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle. Let him perform it at his home, thinking, 'I will bind (attach) cattle to my home.' Let him perform it in the season of abundant fodder, thinking, 'I will bind to myself cattle in a season of abundant fodder.

And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of hisown self ; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer's fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong. Now, when he performs the animal offering.

And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself. Now there is one animal sacrifice of the Haviryagña order , and another of the order of the Soma-sacrifice.

Thus he should say to him.

Well, let them sustain him till the purificatory bath,--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Pratiprasthâtri, the Hotri, the Maitrâvaruna, the Brahman, and the Âgnîdhra, for it is through these that this (formula) is called 'shaddhotri ': having rapidly muttered that 'shaddhotri,' he offers, performing either one or five oblations of ghee ,--'The heaven is his back, the air his body, O Vâkaspati, by his limbs he gave rise to the sacrifice, by his forms to the earth; by his flawless voice and his flawless tongue to the god-gladdening invocation, Hail!' This, indeed, is his initiation.

Now, Soma was in the heavens, and Gâyatrî, having become a bird, fetched him; and inasmuch as one of his leaves (parna) was cut off ,that was how the Parna-tree arose:' such, indeed, is (the passage in) the Brâhmana that is told. And some, it is true, perform the animal sacrifice without Soma, and others with Soma; for he who makes the sacrificial stake other than of Palâsa wood, performs the animal sacrifice without Soma; and he who makes the sacrificial stake of Palâsa performs the animal sacrifice with Soma: therefore let him make his sacrificial stake of Palâsa wood.

But such a one as is bent at the top and bent inwards in the middle, is a type of food (prosperity): therefore let him who wishes for food make such a one his sacrificial stake.

But, indeed, that sacrificial stake of the (ordinary) animal sacrifice is either three or four cubits long, and one that is above that belongs to the Soma-sacrifice.

For as long as a co-sharer is not bought off by (receiving) a share of his own, so long does he consider himself not bought off; but when he is bought off by a share of his own, then, indeed, he considers himself boughtoff: when the Hotri, on that occasion , recites, 'Endow the Rakshas with blood!' he buys him off by (assigning to him) a share of his own. For on that occasion the anguish of the victim, in being slaughtered, becomes concentrated in the heart, and from the heart (it flows) into the spit. Thus, if they (were to) cook the animal together with the heart, the anguish would again spread all over the animal: let him therefore cook it (the heart) after spitting it from the side on a stick.

This, then, is that five-portioned omentum,--fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the sacrificial animal, and five seasons there are in the year: this is why the omentum consists of five portions .

Wherefore, if people were either to forcibly drive him from his home, or to bid him go forth, let him, after performing the Agni-hotra, approach (the fires) saying, 'Wealth'; and he becomes firmly established by offspring and cattle, and is not deprived of his home.

Now, that which is laid down is this very (terrestrial) world; that which is taken out is the air-world, that which is taken forward is the sky, and that which is spread is the regions. And that which is laid down is Agni, that which is taken out is Vâyu (the wind), that which is taken forward is Âditya (the sun), and that which is spread is Kandramas (the moon). And that which is laid down is the Gârhapatya, that which is taken out is the Âhavanîya, that which is taken forward is the (fire) they lead forth eastwards from the Âhavanîya; and that which is spread is the one they take northwards for the cooking of the victim, and that (used) for the by-offerings : let him therefore perform the animal sacrifice on a fire taken forward.

He said to man, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee.'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the cattle!' He said to the cattle, 'I will perform sacrifice with you: I will lay hands upon you.'--'Nay,' said they, 'speak unto the moon!' He said to the moon, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee,'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the sun!' He said to the sun, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee.' 'So be it!' said he; 'but seeing that those liked it not (to be slaughtered), what, then, shall become mine that now is with these ?'--'Whatsoeverthou mayest desire,' he said.--'So be it,' he replied. He laid hands upon him, and this is that animal of his seized (for sacrifice). When slaughtered, it swelled, and by means of those Âprî-hymns, he appeased it ; and inasmuch as, by means of these Âprî-hymns, he appeased it, they are called Âprîs. And let him, for that reason, say of the slaughtered animal, 'Let it lie for a moment!' As great as the world is which he gains by performing the horse-sacrifice, so great a world does he gain by this (animal sacrifice).

Therefore, regarding a new-born son, let him say to five Brâhmanas, before the navel-string has been cut, 'Breathe over him in this way !' But if he should be unable to obtain them he may evenhimself breathe over him whilst walking round him; and that (son of his) attains the full measure of life and lives to old age.

He (the king ) said to his fellow-sacrificers, 'What atonement is there for this?'

He then departed from thence , and, verily, members of the Kesin race are born here even to this day. Hymn Verily, this sacrifice is the same as this blowing (wind): it is that they wish to secure who take the vow of initiation for a year. Of them the Grihapati is initiated first ; for the Grihapati is this (terrestrial) world, and upon this world everything here is established; and so, indeed, are his fellow-sacrificers established in the Grihapati: it is thus after they have become established on a firm foundation that they are initiated. He (the Adhvaryu) then initiates the Brahman (priest)."

And in case there should be a breaking (of the vessel), let him pour out a bowlful or potful of water, and, indeed, whatever is injured or unpropitiated in the sacrifice, for all that water is the means of propitiation, and by water, as a means of propitiation, he thus propitiates it. He does so with these utterances, 'Bhûr bhuvah svar (earth, air, sky);' for these utterances are all-expiatory :he thus makes expiation with all this (universe).

But his wicked enemy seeks to lay hold of him who performs the horse-sacrifice, and the horse is a thunderbolt;--having killed the four-eyed dog, he--with 'Undone is the man! undone is the dog!'--plunges it under the horse's feet: it is by means of the thunderbolthe thus stamps him down; and the wicked enemy does not lay hold of him."

They should be performed once only: thus he is not deprived of his cattle, and does not become poorer. Forty-eight (oblations) he offers;--the Gagatî consists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of Gâgata (movable) nature: by means of the Gagatî he (the Adhvaryu) thus wins cattle for him (the Sacrificer). One additional (oblation) he offers, whence one man is apt to thrive amongst (many) creatures (or subjects).

Now when he performs the Dhriti offerings in the evening--dhriti (keeping) meaning peaceful dwelling, and the night also meaning peaceful dwelling--it is by means of peaceful dwelling that he keeps it; whence both men and beasts rest peacefully at night. And when he performs offerings in the morning, he seeks that (horse); whence it is in daytime that one goes to seek for what is lost.

But, indeed, distinction, royal sway, departs from him who performs the horse-sacrifice; and when a man attains to distinction, the lute is played to him.

One of those who sing is a Brâhmana, and the other a Râganya; for the Brâhmana means priestly office, and the Râganya noble rank: thus his distinction (social position) comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility.

The Brâhmana sings by day , and the Râganya at night ; and thus, indeed, his distinction comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility .

'Such war he waged,--such battle he won!' such (are the topics about which) the Râganya sings; for the battle is the Râganya's strength: it is with strength he thus endows him. Three stanzas the one sings, and three stanzas the other, they amount to six,--six seasons make up a year: he thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the seasons, in the year. To both of them he presents a hundred; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is vitality and energy, vital power, he confers upon him.

For a year he offers the (four Dhriti) oblations --(amounting to) sixteen nineties, for they are the horse's chain , and it is therewith alone that he chains it; whence the horse when let loose returns to its chain: (they amount to) sixteen nineties ; for these (oblations of safe keeping) are the horse's chain, and it is therewith alone that he chains it, whence the horse, when let loose, does not (entirely) abandon its chain.

Those of them who reach the end become (sharers in) the royal sway, but those who do not reach the end are cut off from royal sway. Wherefore let him who holds royal sway perform the horse-sacrifice; for, verily, whosoever performs the horse-sacrifice, without possessing power, is poured (swept) away.--Now, were unfriendly, men to get hold of the horse, his sacrifice would be cut in twain, and he would become the poorer for it. A hundred men clad in armour guard it for the continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice; and he will not become the poorer for it; (but if it be lost) they should fetch another (horse), and sprinkle it: this is the expiation in that case.

He perceived those Vaisvadeva (oblations). He offeredthem, and by means of them he gained the Dîkshâ: and when the Sacrificer offers the Vaisvadeva (oblations) it is the Dîkshâ he thereby gains. Day after day he offers them: day after day he thus gains the Dîkshâ . Seven of them he offers; for seven were those deities that departed (from Pragâpati); it is by means of them that he (the priest) gains the Dîkshâ for him.

Forseven days they observe it; for there are seven (outlets of) vital airs in the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: it is by means of the vital airs he gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs, for him. He makes offering by dividing (each) deity into three parts ; for the gods are of three orders , and of three orders are these worlds: he thus establishes himself in these worlds in prosperity and vital power.

Four Audgrabhanas he offers (on each day), and three Vaisvadevas;--they amount to seven; for there are seven vital airs of the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: by means of the vital airs he thus gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs,for him. A full (-spoon)-oblation he offers last for the sake of invigoration and union. Pragâpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse .

And fifteen (victims), indeed, are (bound) to each of the other (stakes);--for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means manly vigour: with that thunderbolt, manly vigour, the Sacrificer now repels evil on both sides (of the sacrifice).
tadāhuḥ apāhaivaitaiḥ pāpmānaṃ hatā ityakṛtsnaṃ ca tvai prajāpatiṃ saṃskaroti na cedaṃ sarvamavarunddhe //	As to this they say, 'Does he really repel evil by these?' And, indeed, he does not make up the complete Pragâpati, and does not here gain everything.

And sixteen (victims he binds) to each of the other (stakes), for of sixteen parts (kalâ) consists all this (universe); all this (universe) he thus gains.

But let him not do so; let him appease it with the Gâmadagna verses; for Gamadagni is Pragâpati, and so is the Asvamedha: he thus supplies it with its own deity; let him therefore appease (the victims) with the Gâmadagna verses ."

Let him not do so;for the horse is the nobility (chieftain), and the other animals are the peasantry (clan); and those who do this really make the peasantry equal and refractory to the nobility; and they also deprive the Sacrificer of his vital power. Therefore the horse alone belongs to Pragâpati , and the others are sacred to the gods: he thus, indeed, makes the peasantry obedient and subservient to the nobility; and he also supplies the Sacrificer with vital power.

And by means of the golden light (or, by the light of the gold), the Sacrificer also goes to the heavenly world; and he, moreover, makes it a gleam of light shining after him, for him to reach the heavenly world.

On a rattan mat (lying) north (of the Âhavanîya) they cut the portions of the horse(-flesh); for the horse is of anushtubh nature, and related to the Anushtubh is that (northern) quarter: he thus places that (horse) in its own quarter. And as to (his doing so) on a rattan mat,--the horse was produced from the womb of the waters , and the rattan springs from the water: he thus causes it to be possessed of its own (maternal) womb.

When, at the Asvamedha,they glide along with the horse for the Pavamâna (-stotra), it is for getting to know (the way to) the heavenly world; and they hold on to the horse's tail, in order to reach the heavenly world; for man does not rightly know (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse does rightly know it

It makes 'Hiṅ ,' and thereby makes the. Sâman itself to be 'hiṅ': this is the Udgîtha. They pen up mares, (and on seeing the horse) they utter a shrill sound: as when the chanters sing, such like is this. The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the mystic import of this has been explained .

He saw those beasts, the tame and the wild ones; he seized them, and by means of them took possession of these two worlds: by means of the tame beasts he took possession of this (terrestrial) world, and by means of the wild beasts of yonder (world); for this world is the world of men, and yonder world is the world of the gods. Thus when he seizes tame beasts he thereby takes possession of this world, and when wild beasts, he thereby (takes possession) of yonder (world).

By (so doing) with wild (beasts) the roads would run asunder , the village-boundaries of two villages would be far asunder ; and there would come to be ogres, man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers in the forests.

Well, they dismiss them after fire has been carried around them : thus, indeed, it isneither an offering nor a non-offering, and they do not carry the Sacrificer dead to the forest, and there is no violation of the sacrifice.

Having become fivefold it entered the year, and they (the five parts) became those half-months . He followed it up by means of the fifteenfold (sets of victims ), and found it; and having found it, he took possession of it by means of the fifteenfold ones; for, indeed, they--to wit, the fifteenfold (sets)--are a symbol of the half-months, and when he seizes the fifteenfold ones, it is thehalf-months the Sacrificer thereby takes possession of.

The Seasonal sacrifices, doubtless, are manifestly the year; and when he seizes the Seasonal victims , he then manifestly takes possession of the year. ‘And, assuredly, he who spreads out the year in any other way than with the (victims) of the set of eleven (stakes) is deprived of his offspring (orsubjects) and cattle, and fails to reach heaven. This set of eleven (stakes), indeed, is just heaven , and the set of eleven (stakes) means offspring (or people) and cattle and when he lays hands on the (victims) of the (two) sets of eleven (stakes) he does not fail to reach heaven, and is not deprived of his offspring and cattle.

Eleven decades he seizes, for the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh means energy, vigour: thus it is for the obtainment of energy, vigour. Eleven decades he seizes, for in an animal there are ten vital airs, and the body: (trunk) is the eleventh: he thus supplies the animals with vital airs. They belong to all the gods for the completeness of the horse (sacrifice), for the horse belongs to all the gods. They are of many forms, whence beasts are of many forms; they are of distinct forms, whence beasts are of distinct forms.

They weave them in (each) with (one of) the (sacred utterings) relating to Pragâpati, 'Bûh! bhuvah! svar (earth, air,heaven)!' for the horse is sacred to Pragâpati: with its own deity he thus supplies it. With, 'Parched grain, or parched groats?--in grain-food and in food from the cow'--he takes down the remaining food (from the cart) for the horse: he thereby makes the (king's) people eaters of food (prosperous);--'eat ye, gods, this food! eat thou, Pragâpati, this food!' he thereby supplies the people with food.

The Hotri and the Brahman engage in a Brahmodya (theological discussion); for the Hotri relates to Agni, and the Brahman (priest) to Brihaspati, Brihaspati being the Brahman (n.): fiery spirit and spiritual lustre he thus bestows together on him. With the (central) sacrificial stake between them, they discourse together; for the stake is the Sacrificer : he thus encompasses the Sacrificer on both sides with fiery spirit and spiritual lustre.

Whilst the Sacrificer holds on to him behind, he (in sprinkling the horse) runs rapidly through the formula used at the Soma-sacrifice , and then commences the one for the Asvamedha.

Having satisfied the horse, and consecrated again the sprinkling water, he sprinkles the other victims: thereof hereafter.

'A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,' this is what they spread out for the horse :thereon they quiet (slay) it, as (is done) for no other victim; and thus they separate it from the other victims.

Whilst it is being quieted, he (the Adhvaryu) offers (three) oblations , with , 'To the breath hail! to the off-breathing hail! to the through-breathing hail!' he thereby lays the vital airs into it, and thus offering is made by him with this victim as a living one .

Thrice they walk round ; for three (in number) are these worlds: by means of these worlds they fan it. Thrice again they walk round ,--that amounts to six, for there are six seasons: by means of the seasons they fan it.

Nine times they walk round ; for there are nine vital airs: vital airs they thus put into their own selves, and the vital airs do not depart from them. 'I will urge the seed-layer, urge thou the seed-layer!' (the Mahishî says );--seed, doubtless, means offspring and cattle: offspring and cattle she thus secures for herself. 'Let us stretch our feet,' thus in order to secure union. 'In heaven ye envelop yourselves' (the Adhvaryu says),--for that is, indeed, heaven where they immolate the victim: therefore hespeaks thus.--'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she says in order to secure union.

'Even as one taking a burden up a mountain,'--glory (pomp), doubtless, is the burden of royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus fastens on him (as a burden); but he also endows him with that glory, royal power. 'And may the centre of her body prosper,'--the centre of royal power, doubtless, is glory: glory (prosperity), food, he thus lays into the very centre of royal power (or, the kingdom).
śīte vāte punanniveti kṣemo vai rāṣṭrasya śītaṃ kṣemamevāsmai karoti //	'As one winnowing in the cool breeze,'--the cool of royal power, doubtless, is security ofpossession: security of possession he procures for him.

'The praises of Dadhikrâvan have I sung, (the victorious, powerful horse: may he make fragrant our mouths, and prolong our lives!),'--thus they finally utter a verse containing the word 'fragrant': it is (their own) speech they purify , and the vital airs do not pass from them.

By way of horizontal and vertical (stitches ) they are many-formed, whence the regions are many-formed; and they are of distinct form, whence the regions are of distinct form.

He perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the Asvamedha; he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more numerous: hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous, let him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the Asvamedha; and he indeed becomes great and more numerous.

Some gods have the svâhâ-call ('hail') in front, and the other gods have the svâhâ-call behind : it is them he thus gratifies. With 'Hailto the gods!' and 'To the gods hail!' he makes offering by means of the king (Soma) on both sides of the omentum: he thereby gratifies those gods who are in this world, and those who are in the other, and thus gratified, both these kinds of gods lead him to the heavenly world.

Thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a Brahman they thereby redeem; and he who performs the Asvamedha redeems all sin, he redeems the slaying of a Brahman.

The last day is an Atirâtra with all the Stomas --with a view to his obtaining and securing everything, for an Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.

The Sakvarî (verses) are the Prishtha (-stotra of the second day): there is a different metre for each (verse), for different kinds of animals, both domestic and wild ones, are immolated here on each (day). As to the Sakvarî (verses) being the Prishtha, it is for the completeness of the horse (sacrifice) ; and different kinds of animals are immolated on different (days), because different stomas are performed on the different (days of the Asvamedha).

On the last day he immolates bovine (victims), for they--to wit, bovine (victims)--are all animals: he thus immolates all animals. They are sacred to the All-gods , for the completeness of the horse, for the horse is sacred to the All-gods. They are many-formed (or, many-coloured), whence animals are many-formed; and they are of distinct forms (or colours), whence animals are of distinct forms.

For that Anushtubh, doubtless, is the highest metre, and the horse is the highest of animals; and the Katushtoma is the highest of Stomas: by means of what is highest he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach the highest position.

When the Samkriti is the Akhâvâka's Sâman, it is for (bringing about) the completeness of the horse (sacrifice). The last day is an Atirâtra with all the (six) Stomas, in order to his (the Sacrificer's) obtaining everything, for an Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.

There are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: these are the three heads on the Asvamedha; and, verily, he who thus knows them becomes the head of kings. And, indeed, he who knows the three tops on the Asvamedha, becomes the top of kings;--there are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: these, indeed, are the three tops on the Asvamedha; and, verily, he who thus knows them becomes the top of kings.

To such (a death) hail!"" he would make that manifold death his enemy , and would give himself over to Death.' Only one oblation he offers to one of them, with, 'To Death, hail!' for there is indeed but one Death in yonder world, even Hunger : it is him he wards off in yonder world."

At whosoever's Asvamedha, therefore, this oblation is offered, even if in after-times any one in his family kills a Brahman, he thereby prepares a remedy (expiation) for him. When the horse was slaughtered, the life-sap went out of it; it became the Asvastomîya (set of oblations ): when he offers the Asvastomîya (oblations) he indeed supplies the horse with life-sap.

He performs with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the favourite resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their favourite resource.

The Asvastomîya, surely, is cattle, and the Dvipadâ is man: inasmuch as he performs the Dvipadâs after performing the Asvastomîya, man subsequently establishes himself amongst cattle.

He offers no other as a final oblation : were he to offer another as a final oblation, he would losehis support. The Dvipadâs he offers last, for Dvipadâs are a support: he thus finds a support (establishes himself). With, 'To Gumbaka hail!' he offers, at the purificatory bath, the last oblation ; for Gumbaka is Varuna: by sacrifice he thus manifestly redeems himself from Varuna. He offers it on the head of a white-spotted , baldheaded (man) with protruding teeth and reddish brown eyes; for that is Varuna's form: by (that) form (of his) he thus redeems himself from Varuna.

Concerning this they say, 'These to wit, ishtis--are a form of sacrifice: were he to perform ishtis, the sacrifice would be ready to incline towards him; but he would become the worse for it, for, surely, of exhausted strength now are the metres (offering formulas) of him who has performed the Soma-sacrifice;--how could he make use of them so soon? For when the sacrifice is complete, Vâk (speech and sacred writ ) is wholly gained, and, being gained, it now is exhausted in strength, and, as it were, wounded and mangled; but sacrifice is speech: hence he should not make use of it.'

If the sacrificial horse were to couple with a mare, let him in addition prepare a milk (oblation) to Vâyu;--Vâyu doubtless is the transformer of seeds, for Vâyu (the wind) is the vital air, and the vital air is the transformerof seeds: by means of seed he thus puts seed into it. And if disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap to Pûshan, for Pûshan rules over beasts (cattle); and, indeed, he thereby gratifies him who owns cattle and rules over cattle; and it (the horse) thereby indeed becomes free from disease.

And as to why it is a pap (karu), it is because by means of the eye this self (body or mind) moves (kar).

And as to why it is (prepared) of barley, it is because barley belongs to Varuna.

And even by itself this (ishti) is the recoverer of what is lost; and even if any other thing of his were to get lost let him perform this very offering, and he verily finds it. And if enemies were to obtain the horse, or if it were to die (either in any other way) or in water , let them bring another (horse) and consecrate it by sprinkling: this, indeed, is the expiation in that case.

He beheld this three days’ Soma-sacrifice, the Asvamedha, and took possession of it, and sacrificed with it: by sacrificing therewith he obtained all his desires, and attained all attainments; and, verily, whosoever performs the Asvamedha sacrifice obtains all his desires, and attains all attainments.

Four bowlfuls, four double handfuls, four handfuls: twelvefold this is--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything--thus it is in order to his gaining and securing everything.

He (the Sacrificer) gives to them four thousand (cows) in order to his gaining and securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.

With a view to commencing the sacrifice, he then says to him, 'Restrain thy speech!' for the sacrifice is speech.

At this (offering) he releases speech by (bestowing) a boon,saying, 'I grant a boon to the Brahman (priest):' (this he does) with a view to his gaining and securing everything, for a boon is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.

For, indeed, all the deities have Agni for their mouth, and in the Asvamedha are (contained) all objects of desire: 'Having, at the outset (mukhatah), gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks.

The two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra , with a view to the repelling of evil, for Vritra is evil. 'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky . . . ,' and 'Be thou the leader of the sacrifice and the realm of space (whither thou strivest with auspicious teams: thy light-winning head hast thou raised to the sky, and thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering),' pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvâkyâ and yâgyâ of the chief oblation.

The two butter-portions are possessed of 'growth ,' even for the growth of the Sacrificer. 'Pûshan, in thy sway we ,' and 'The hymn (?) lovingly composed by desire of praise hath reachedthe guardian of every path: (may he, Pûshan, grant unto us draughts of light (?), and fulfil our every prayer!'), pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvâkyâ and yâgyâ of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) 'sway,' the other (the word) 'path'; for sway is vigour: (thus it is) in order to his gaining and securing vigour; and as to why (the other) contains (the word) 'path,' he thereby secures successful progress to the horse. The invitatory and offering formulas of the Svishtakrit are two anushtubh verses ; for the Anushtubh is speech, and Pragâpati is speech, and the Asvamedha is Pragâpati: thus it is for the obtainment of the Asvamedha.

And as to its being without its match under the right-side yoke, it is for the sake of his obtaining yonder (sun), for that (horse) indeed is he that shines yonder, and assuredly there is no one to rival him.

When Pragâpati's vital airs had gone out of him, his body began to swell; and what phlegm there was in it that flowed together and burst forth from inside through the nose, and it became this tree, the raggudâla, whence it is viscid, for it originated from phlegm: with that form (quality) he thus endows it (the stake). And as to why it is the (stake) standing by the fire, it is because that one is the centre of the stakes, and that nose is the centre of the (channels of the) vital airs: he thus puts it in its own place.

And because these two (pîtudâru stakes) are on the two sides of the central one, therefore these two eyes are on the two sides of the nose: he thus puts those two in their own place.

The two (sets of) pîtudâru (stakes) stand inside, and the bilva ones outside, for the eyes are inside, and the ears outside: he thus puts them in their own place.

The bilva (stakes) areinside, and the khadira ones outside, for inside is the marrow, and outside the bones: he thus puts them in their own place.

The khadira (stakes) are inside, and the palâsa ones outside, for inside are the bones, and outside is the flesh: he thus puts them in their own place.

Having thus completely restored this Pragâpati, the sacrifice, he therein seizes twenty-one Agnîshomîya victims: for these there is one and the same performance, and this is the performance of the day before (the first Sutyâ).

If they do so, let hire (the Hotri),after reciting the Stotriya (strophe) together, recite the Anurûpa (strophe) together: the Rathantara Prishtha-sâman , the Sastra containing the Rathantara (text), and the Agnishtoma sacrifice--thereby he makes sure of this world.

With twelve Anuvâkas , 'To the in-breathing hail! To the off-breathing hail!' (he offers)--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything: thus it is for his obtaining and securing everything.

And the Bârhata Praüga and the Mâdhukhandasa one he recites both together in triplets--(this being done) for the obtainment of the objects of desire which (may be contained) both in the Bârhata and the Mâdhukhandasa Praüga. The morning-service is (thus) set right.

This (verse), being recited thrice, amounts to a triplet, and thereby he obtains the object of desire which (may be contained) in the triplet. 'Here, O good one, is the pressed plant' is the 'anukara' (sequent triplet): this same (triplet) is the constantconnecting link of the one-day's sacrifice . Having recited both the paṅkti 'Here in the Soma-draught alone (the Brahman gave thee strength),' and the six-footed ones 'The patron thou art of the offerer of Soma,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice. Thus as to the Marutvatîya (-sastra).

The Mahânâmnî (verses) are the Prishtha (-stotra); and he recites them along with the anurûpa (verses) and pragâtha (-strophes), for the obtainment of all the objects of his desire, for in the Mahânâmnîs, as well as in the Asvamedha, are contained all objects of desire. Having recited the paṅkti verses 'Indra hath grown in ebriety and strength,' and the six-footed ones 'This sacred work didst thou protect infights with Vritra,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice .

The Puroruk formula thereof is , 'The golden germ was first produced . . .' And its Puronuvâkyâ is , 'Of good nature, self-existent at first (within the great ocean: I verily place the right germ whence is born Pragâpati).'--'May the Hotri offer to Pragâpati: ' is the Praisha . The Hotri utters the offering-formula , 'O Pragâpati, none other than thee hath encompassed all these forms .

The Puroruk thereof is , 'He who by his greatness hath become the one king of the breathing and blinking world, .' The Anuvâkyâ and Yâgyâ are interchanged so as to (ensure) unimpaired vigour , and the Praisha (direction to Hotri) is the same (as that of the first cup). As the Vashat is uttered, he offers with , 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the night, and the year, .' He does not repeat the Vashat: the significance of this has been explained.

But the former, indeed, is the established practice. The sacrifice (of the second day) is an Ukthya: thereby he causes the air-world to prosper. The last day is an Atirâtra with all the Stomas, for him to obtain and secure everything, for the Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.

This, then, being a forty-days’ (performance), including the Dîkshâs and Upasads, amounts to a Virâg , for the Virâg consists of forty syllables: 'Thence Virâg (f.) was born, and from out of Virâg the Pûrusha.' This, then, is that Virâg, and from out of that Virâg he (the Sacrificer) generates the Purusha, the Sacrifice.

And the Ukthya is food, and the Atirâtra the body (self); and because there are these Ukthyas on both sides of the Atirâtra, therefore this body is surrounded by food. And that Atirâtra which is the largest of them is in. the middle, it is thereby that it (the body, or sacrifice) is like a barley-corn (yava) in the middle; and, verily,whosoever knows this repels (yu) his hateful enemy: 'He alone exists, not his hateful enemy,' thus they say of him.

And whatever food there is in these worlds that is its 'medha,' its food; and inasmuch as this is its 'medha,' its food, therefore (it is called) Purushamedha. And inasmuch as at this (sacrifice) he seizes men (purusha) meet for sacrifice (medhya), therefore also it is called Purushamedha.

They now prepare a burial-place (smasâna ) for him, (to serve him) either as a house or as a monument; for when any one dies, he is a corpse (sava), and for that (corpse) food (anna) is thereby prepared, hence 'savanna,' for, indeed, 'savanna' is what is mystically called 'smasâna.' But 'smasâh' also are called the eaters amongst the Fathers, and they, indeed, destroy in yonder world the good deeds of him who has had no sepulchre prepared for him: it is for them that he prepares that food, whence it is 'smasânna,' for 'smasânna' is what is mystically called 'smasâna.'

Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending in the (four) regions (quarters). The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from the regions, and, being regionless, they were overcome. Wherefore the people who are godly make their burial-places four-cornered, whilst those who are of the Asura nature, the Easterns and others , (make them)round, for they (the gods) drove them out from the regions. He arranges it so as to lie between the two regions, the eastern and the southern , for in that region assuredly is the door to the world of the Fathers: through the above he thus causes him to enter the world of the Fathers; and by means of the (four) corners he (the deceased) establishes himself in the regions, and by means of the other body (of the tomb) in the intermediate regions: he thus establishes him in all the regions.

He makes it on ground inclining towards the north, for the north is the region of men: he thus gives him (the deceased) a share in the world of men; and in that respect, indeed, the Fathers share in the world of men that they have offspring; and his (the deceased man's) offspring will, indeed, be more prosperous.

Let him not do so, however, for, indeed, such a one is an opening tomb, and certainly another of these (members of the dead man's family) quickly follows him in death.

But one must not do so, for indeed such (a burial place) alone becomes rising sin which one makes, on ground inclining towards the north.

On such (ground) as is filled with roots, for to the Fathers belongs the (sod) filled with roots;--it is (sod) of vîrina (Andropogon muricatus) and other grasses, for thus the Fathers’ share in this (earth) is not excessive ; and he also thereby makes (the deceased's) sin to be restricted .

For an Agnikit (builder of a fire-altar) one makes the tomb after the manner of the fire-altar; for when a Sacrificer builds a fire-altar he thereby constructs for himself by sacrifice a (new) body for yonder world; but that sacrificial performance is not complete until the making of a tomb; and when he makes the tomb of the Agnikit after the manner of the fire-altar, it is thereby he completes the Agnikityâ.

Having attended to this, he encloses it with cords twisted (and extended) in the non-sunwise way ; for the (sacrificial) performance connected with the Fathers is done in the non-sunwise way.

He should cut it out to whatever extent he intends to raise (the sepulchral mound), but let him rather cut it out so as to be just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for another. For, on the one hand , the Fathers are the world of plants, and amongst the roots of plants they (are wont to) hide; and, on the other , (he does so) lest he (the deceased) should be separated from this (earth).

S. XXXV, I), 'Let the niggards avaunt from hence, the perverse scorners of the gods!'--he thereby expels from this world the niggards, the perverse haters of the gods, the Asura-Rakshas;--'it is the place of this Soma-offerer,' for he who has performed a Soma-sacrifice is a Soma-offerer;--'(an abode) distinguished by lights, by days, by nights,'--he thereby makes him tobe of the world of the seasons, the days and nights;--

He throws out this (branch) to the right (south), the other to the left (north) side: he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers.

Having given the order, saying, 'Yoke!' he (the Sacrificer) utters the formula , 'May Savitri vouchsafe for thy bones a place in the earth!'--Savitri now indeed vouchsafes a place in the earth for his (the deceased man's) bones;--'Let the oxen be yoked therefore!' for it is indeed for this work that the oxen are yoked.

Having turned round (the plough) from right to left , he ploughs the first furrow with , 'May Vâyu purify!' along the north side (along the cord) towards the west ; with, 'May Savitri purify!' along the west side towards the south; with, 'With Agni's lustre!' along the south side towards the east; with, 'With Sûrya's brilliance!' along the front side towards the north.

He then sows (seed) of all (kinds of) herbs: what the all-herb (seed signified) on that occasion , that (it does) here. With many (verses ) he sowsthat (former seed), with a single one this,--he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers,--with .

Before sunrise (he does so), for, in secret, as it were, are the Fathers, and in secret, as it were, is the night;--in secret, indeed, he does this, (but) so that (the sun) should rise over him doing it: on both day and night he thus establishes him.

Thus this his body, furnished with wings and tail, is just like that of Agni (the fire-altar).

For a Kshatriya he may make it as high as a man with upstretched arms, for a Brâhmana reaching up to the mouth, for a woman up to the hips, for a Vaisya up to the thighs, for a Sûdra up to the knee; for suchlike is their vigour.

While that (mound) is being made, they hold a bundle (of reed grass) to the left (north, uttaratah) of it,--that is offspring: they thus hold the (deceased's) offspring upwards (uttaratah). Do not let him throw it down either after holding it up, or after bringing it; but let him set it up in the house : he thus sets up offspring in the house.

With , 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water with his joined hands,--for water is a thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus makes friendship,--and with, 'Unfriendly may they be unto him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' he throws it in the direction in which he who is hateful to him may be, and thereby overthrows him.

Having bathed, and put on garments that have never yet been washed, they hold on to the tail of an ox , and return (to their home),--for the ox is of Agni's nature: headed by Agni they thus return from the world of the Fathers to the world of the living. And Agni, indeed, is he who leads one over the paths (one has to travel), and it is he who leads these over.

When they have arrived, ointments for the eyes and the feet are given them: such, indeed, are human means of embellishment, and therewith they keep off death from themselves.

'Thou, Agni, causest vital powers to flow: (send us food and drink, and keep calamity.

He then offers, with , 'Long-lived be thou, O Agni, growing by offering, ghee-mouthed, ghee-born: drinking the sweet, pleasant cow's ghee, guard thou these, as a father does his son, hail!' he thus says this so that he (Agni) may guard and protect these (men). The sacrificial fee for this (ceremony) consists of an old ox, old barley, an old arm-chair with head-cushion--this at least is the prescribed Dakshinâ, but he may give more according to his inclination. Such, indeed, (is the performance) in the case of one who had built a fire-altar.

'Let him use pebbles (instead of bricks ) in the case of one who keeps up a sacrificial fire,' say some, 'they are just what those pebbles used at the Agnyâdheya are .' 'Let him not use them,' say others; 'surely they would be liable to weigh heavily upon one who has not built a fire-altar.' Let him do as he pleases.

Hymn The gods Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Vishnu, and the Visve Devâh, except the two Asvins, performed a sacrificial session .

Therefore people say that Kurukshetra is the gods’ place of divine worship: hence wherever in Kurukshetra one settles there one thinks, 'This is a place for divine worship;' for it was the gods’ place of divine worship. They entered upon the session thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!' And in like manner do these (men) now enter upon the sacrificial session thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!'

'So be it,' they said.
tadviṣṇuḥ prathamaḥ prāpa sa devānāṃ śreṣṭho'bhavattasmādāhurviṣṇurdevānāṃ śreṣṭha iti //	Vishnu first attained it, and he became themost excellent of the gods; whence people say, 'Vishnu is the most excellent of the gods.'

But, indeed, Vishnu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his.

He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him.

tasyopaparāsṛtya jyāmapijakṣustasyāṃ cinnāyāṃ dhanurārtnyau viṣphurantyau viṣṇoḥ śiraḥ pracicidatuḥ //	When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vishnu's head. It fell with (the sound) 'ghriṅ'; and on falling it became yonder sun.

And the vital sap which flowed from him they wiped up (sam-mrig) with their hands, whence the Samrâg .

Indra reached him first. He applied himself to him limb after limb, and encompassed him , and, in encompassing him, he became (possessed of) that glory of his. And, verily, he who knows this becomes (possessed of) that glory which Indra is (possessed of).
sa u eva makhaḥ sa viṣṇuḥ tata indro makhavānabhavanmakhavānha vai tam maghavānityācakṣate paro'kṣam paro'kṣakāmā hi devāḥ //	And Makha (sacrifice), indeed, is the same as Vishnu: hence Indra became Makhavat (possessed of makha), since Makhavat is he who is mystically called Maghavat , for the gods love the mystic.
tābhyo vamrībhyo'nnādyam prāyacan āpo vai sarvamannaṃ tābhirhīdamabhiknūyamivādanti yadidaṃ kimvadanti //	They gave to those ants the enjoyment of food; but, indeed, all food is water, for it is by moistening (the food) therewith that one eats here whatever one does eat.
athemam viṣṇuṃ yajñam tredhā vyabhajanta vasavaḥ prātaḥsavanaṃ rudrā mādhyandinaṃ savanamādityāstṛtīyasavanam //	This Vishnu, the (Soma-) sacrifice, they then divided amongst themselves into three parts: the Vasus (received) the morning-pressing, the Rudras the midday-pressing, and the Âdityas the third pressing.
agniḥ prātaḥsavanam indro mādhyandinaṃ savanam viśve devāstṛtīyasavanam //	Agni (received) the morning-pressing, Indrathe midday-pressing, and the Visve Devâh the third pressing.

The gods went on worshipping and toiling with that headless sacrifice.

And, verily, he who either teaches or partakes of this (Pravargya), enters that life, and that light.

Let him not spit whilst the sun shines, lest he should spit upon him. Let him not discharge urine whilst the sun shines, lest he discharge it upon him. For so long as he shines, so great he (the sun) is: thinking, 'Lest I should injure him by these (acts),' let him take food at night, after striking a light, whereby it is made to be a form of him who shines yonder. But on this point Âsuri used to say,--One rule the gods indeed keep, to wit, the truth: let him therefore speak nothing but the truth.

He said, 'Verily, after bursting open (â-dar), as it were, this vital sap has sung praises:' thence Âdâra (-plants originated); and because he lay there stinking (pûy), as it were, therefore (they are also called) Pûtîka; and hence, when placed on the fireas an offering, they blaze; and hence also they are fragrant, for they originated from the vital sap of the sacrifice. And inasmuch as Indra, on that occasion, encompassed him with might, therefore he says, 'Indra's might ye are;'--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.

At the top he then draws it out (so as to form) a spout of three thumbs’ breadths (high): he thereby makes a nose to this (Mahâvîra, or Pravargya). When it is complete, he touches it with , 'Makha's head thou art,'--for it indeed is the head of Makha Saumya (the Soma-sacrifice).

And as to their being in pairs,--a pair means strength, for when two take hold of each other they exert strength; and a pair (couple) means a productive union: with a productive union he thus supplies and completes it.

Having turned round the Emperor's throne-seat in front of the Âhavanîya, he places it south thereof, and north of the King's (Soma's) throne-seat , so as to face the east.

Moreover, Soma is king, and the Pravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher than the royal: therefore he places it north of it .

For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from below; and that, to wit, gold, being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Earth also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing , might injureher: he thus keeps it separate from her. White it is, for white, as it were , is this earth.

When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and therefrom these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.

Whilst this (pot) is being heated, the (Sacrificer's) wife covers her head, thinking, 'Lest this one, when heated and glowing, should rob me of my eyesight,' for it indeed becomes heated and glowing.

'Possessed of sons towards the south,'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'in Indra's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Indra her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou offspring unto me!'--he thus secures offspring and cattle for himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of sons and of cattle.

When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers, but the Fathers are three in number : it is with these that he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).

For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from above; and that--to wit, gold--being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Sky also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing, might injure it: he thus keeps it separate therefrom. It is yellow, for yellow, as it were, is the sky.

Three (fans) there are, for there are three breathings, the out (and in)-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing: it is these he thus lays into it.

Theyfan again thrice in the sunwise way,--this makes six; and six in number are these breathings (vital airs) in the head: it is these he thus lays into it. They cook the two Rauhina (cakes). When a blaze is produced, he takes off the gold (plate).

If it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer will become more prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will become poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he (the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but indeed (the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.

Six of them step up to it, for six in number are these vital airs in the head: it is these he thus lays into it.

Aditi, come hither! Sarasvatî, come hither!' for the cow is Idâ, and the cow is Aditi, and the cow is Sarasvatî. And he also calls her by her (real) name, with these (formulas), 'N.N. , come hither!' thus thrice.

He then leads it (the calf) away with, 'Afford (milk) for the Gharma!' for the Gharma, doubtless, is that fluid which this (cow) lets flow: he thus means to say thereby, 'Allow her a share!'

The (spilt) drops he then consecrates with, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice, and therefore he says, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.

He then steps up to the site of the Gârhapatya with, 'I pass along the wide aerial realm,'--the mystic import of this is the same as before .

Thereupon (having lifted up the pot) he sweeps it clean with a branch of reed grass: the mystic import of this is the same as before.

For at this time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Svâhâ-call before (its being taken to) the Âhavanîya, being thus offered they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it with the Svâhâ-call before (its being taken to) the Âhavanîya, and being thus offered he offers it (again) in the fire.

'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!'--the flood (sarira) indeed is he who blows here, for from out of that flood all the gods and all the creatures come forth together (saha irate): it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!'

This is his (Indra's) special share: even as there is a share for a chief , so is this his (share) apart from the (other) gods.

On the repetition of the Vashat, he offers-- With, 'Hail to Agni, worthy of sacrifice!'--this is in lieu of the Svishtakrit (offering), for Agni is the maker of good offering;--'may blessing result from the sacrificial texts!' for by the sacrificial texts that (sun) is established (as the Mahâvîra) in this world: thus it is them he thereby pleases.

'Hail to the Fathers, (seated) upon the Barhis , and drinking the Gharma!'--even without offering he secretes (this, the fourth stick) under the barhis of the south part (of the vedi ) whilst looking towards the north . When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers--the Fathers being three in number: it is them he thus pleases.

And as to why he does not look at it, he does so thinking, 'Lest Rudra should do me harm.'

He, having solicited an invitation (to the meal), drinks it with, 'Offered is the honey unto Agni, the greatest of Indras,'--'Offered is the honey unto Agni, the most powerful,' he thereby means to say; 'let us eat of thee, god Gharma: reverence be unto thee, injure us not!'--a blessing he thereby invokes.

The pieces of wood he throws into the fire. They then proceed with the Upasad. And thus the head of the sacrifice has been set right in the very same manner in which the Asvins then restored it.

One mayperform it for all (the Sacrificer's) property; for all one's property means everything, and this (Pravargya) is everything. One may perform it at a Visvagit with all the Prishthas ; for the Visvagit (all-conquering day) with all the Prishthas means everything, and this (Pravargya) is everything One may perform it at the Vâgapeya (and) Râgasûya, for such (a ceremony) means everything. One may perform it at a sacrificial session, for the session means everything, and this (Pravargya) is everything.

Let him say, 'By the Âhavanîya.'--'How the New and Full-moon sacrifices?' Let him say, 'By the ghee and the cake.'--'How the Seasonal sacrifices?' Let him say, 'By the oblation of clotted curds .'--'How the animal sacrifice?' Let him say, 'By the victim and the cake.'--'How the Soma-sacrifice?' Let him say, 'By the Havirdhâna .'

Well, this--to wit, the Pranîtâ (water)--being the head of the sacrifice, and the Pravargya also being its head, (he does so) thinking, 'Lest I cause the head to be overtopped by a head.'

Well, the fore-offerings and after-offerings being the vital airs, and so also the Avakâsas , and the pieces of wood, (it is so) lest he should cause the vital airs to be overtopped by vital airs.

Well, those two--to wit, the butter-portions--being the eyes of the sacrifice, and so also the two Rauhina (cakes)--(it is so) lest he should overtop eye by eye.

When the Sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away and entered the heaven and the earth. Now this (earth) is clay, and yonder (sky) is water; and the Mahâvîra (vessels) are made of clay and water: thus he supplies and completes it (the Pravargya) with that life-sap.

And, verily, whosoever either, teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation .

Having gathered together all around it (the Mahâvîra pot), theymeet together upon the Vedi in the Sâlâ, (entering) by the front door.

When the sacrifice had its head cut off its heat went out of it, and entered these worlds: it is with that heat he thus supplies and completes it.

When he sings the Sâman it is in order that the fiends, the Rakshas, should not injure theseoutside the sacrifice, the body; for the Sâman is a repeller of the fiends, the Rakshas.

On an Atikkhandas (verse) he sings it, for that--to wit, the Atikkhandas (redundant metre) is all metres, therefore he sings it on an Atikkhandas (verse). He sings , 'Agni burneth, encountereth with flames, Ahâvo! Ahâvo !'--it is thus he repels the fiends, the Rakshas, from here.

In this way the other two (pots are placed) east of it: this is threefold, for the head is threefold .

On the two sides thereof the two milking-bowls (pinvana): two testicles he thereby gives to it, for by means of his testicles the male overflows (pinv). Behind (them he places) the post and peg: whereby he gives two thighs to it; behind (them) the two Rauhina-plates, whereby he gives two knees to it; and as to their being single plates, it is because these knees consist, as it were, of single plates (bones). Behind (them) the two poking-sticks (dhrishti), whereby he gives two feet to it, for with the feet one strikes out boldly (dhrishtam).

With , 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us,' he takes water in his joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a covenant with the thunderbolt;--and with, 'May they be unfriendly unto him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction he who is hateful to him may be, and he thereby overthrows him.
