Here by reason of the superimposition of the action of the eyes [upon the lotuses] words expressive [of that action] have been predicated [ of the lotuses ]. Spitting, belching, vomitting and such other words, only when appearing under a secondary sense, are very pleasing;
padmānyakauśuniṣṭhadhūtāḥ pītvā pāvakavipruṣaḥ | bhūyo vamantīva mukhairudgīrṇāruṇareṇubhiḥ ||	[For example-1 The lotuses, having drunk the sparks of fire emitted by solar rays, seem once again to vomit them through their mouths that eject reddish pollen'.

For exampledeclared 'The rows of clouds thundering, [like moaning women enceiente,] overpowered by the heavy weight of the foetus <in the form of water> are here lying upon the lap of the <friend in the form of the mountain table-land.' 98 Here, lying upon the lap of the friend, moaning, heaviness, fatigue-these manifold characteristics of the enceiente are exhibited [ by transference ].
tadetat kāvyasarvasvaṃ samādhirnāma yo guṇaḥ | kavisārtha: samagropi tamekamupajīvati ||	This quality that is called Transference is indeed the all-in-all of poetry; all poets whatsoever, without exception, follow its guidance.
iti mārgadvayaṃ bhinnaṃ tatsvarūpanirūpaṇāt | tadbhedāstu na śakyante vaktuṃ pratikavi sthitāḥ ||	Thus these two Styles are differentiated by a description of the nature of each. [Subsidiary] divisions of them as existing in the individual poets it is not possible to describe.

"They declare it to be the one mainstay of all other figures this mode-of-expression honoured by Masters of speech and going by the name of Hyperbole.
anyathaiva sthitā vṛttiścetanasyetarasya vā | anyathotprekṣyate yatra tāmutprekṣāṃ viduryathā ||	When the condition of some sentient or insentient being is poetically-conceived as being otherwise than what it in reality, that is known as Poetic-Conception.
madhyaṃdinārkasaṃtaptaḥ sarasī gāhate gajaḥ | manye mārtaṇḍagṛhyāṇi padmānyuddhartumudyataḥ ||	For example"Oppressed by the mid-day sun the elephant plunges into the lake, eager, me-seems, to up-root the lotuses, the partisans of the sun".

karṇasya bhūṣaṇamidaṃ madāyativirodhinaḥ | iti karṇotpalaṃ prāyastava dṛṣṭyā vilayate ||	"This serves as an ornament unto the ear that hinders my expansion'; probably for this reason it is that the ear-lotus is being invaded by the eye".

keṣāṃcidupamābhrāntirivaśrutyeha jāyate | nopamānaṃ tiṅantenetyatikramyāptabhāṣitam ||	226 Hearing the word iva (as-if) some wrongly imagine a simile in this [example], setting aside the authoritative ruling that a verb cannot become the standard-of-comparison.
upamānopameyatvaṃ tulyadharmavyapekṣayā | limpatestamasaścāsau dharmaḥ kotra samakṣyite ||	[ ii, 235 It is only as depending upon some common property that things are assigned the nature of a standard-of-comparison or the object-of-comparison;

yo limpatya tunā tulyaṃ tama ityapi śaṃsataḥ | aṅgānīti na saṃbaddhaṃ sopi mṛgyaḥ samo guṇaḥ ||	Even according to the view that-'Darkness resembles the agent of anointing', the [word] 'limbs' is not connected;
yathenduriva te baktramiti kāntiḥ pratīyate | na tathā limpaterlepādanyadatra pratīyate ||	Just as in-Thy face is like the moon' the brilliance [as common property] is what is suggested, not so from 'anointing' is anything but the anointing suggested.
tadupaśleṣaṇārthīya limpativantikartṛkaḥ | aṅgakarmā ca puṃsaivamutprekṣyata itīkṣyatām ||	232 So let it be concluded that the [verb] 'annointing' having the sense of besmearing and related to 'darkness' as the agent and to 'limbs' as the object is thus poeticallyconceived by the person.
manye śaṅke dhruvaṃ prāyo nūnamityevamādibhiḥ | utprekṣā vyajyate śabdairivaśadvopi tādṛśaḥ ||	Poetic-Conception is indicated by words like manye (me-thinks) sanke (I trow), dhruvam (certainly), prāyas (probably), nunam (assuredly ), etc.; the word iva (as-if) is of the same sort.
hetuśca sūkṣmaleśau ca vācāmuttamabhūṣaṇam | kārakaśāpakau hetū tau cānekavidhau yathā ||	- The Cause, the Subtle, and the Little are the best embellishments of speech. The Cause is either Efficient or Probatory and both of them have numerous varieties.

nirvatyai ca vikārye ca hetutvaṃ tadapekṣayā | prāpye tu karmaṇi prāyaḥ kriyāpekṣaiva hetutā ||	When an object is to-be-originated or transformed, the causal relation exists with reference to that; when however it is to be [merely] reached, the causal relation, as a rule, concerns itself with the action only.
heturnirvartanīyasya darśitaḥ śeṣayordvayoḥ | datvodāharaṇadvandvaṃ jñāpako varṇayiṣyate ||	Of the two remaining [Causes] will first be given a pair of examples, and then the Probative[-Cause] will be described.

gatostama bhātīnduryānti vāsāya pakṣiṇaḥ | itīdamapi sādhveva kālāvasthānivedane ||	An example [involving an actual (and not figurative) reaching] such as'The sun has gone to the Setting [-mountain]', 'The moon is coming into view', or 'The birds are repairing to their nests', is good enough [as a Probatory Cause] when an indication of the time is intended.
abādhyairindupādānāmasādhyaiścandanāmbhasām | dehoṣmabhiḥ subodhaṃ te sakhi kāmāturaṃ manaḥ ||	254 [A regular example would be-] "From the heat of your body that is not to be allayed by lunar rays and not to be cured by sandal juice, O friend, it is easy to infer that your heart is love-afflicted".

This praise of [the king's] pre-eminent valour is nothing but censure which is calculated, in the case of [this] maiden longing for uninterrupted enjoyments, to turn her love away from him.
capalo nirdayaścāsau janaḥ kiṃ tena me sakhi | āgaḥpramārjanāyaiva cāṭavo yena śikṣitāḥ || doṣābhāso guṇaḥ kopi darśitaścāṭukāritā | mānaṃ sakhijanoddiṣṭaṃ kartuṃ rāgādaśaktayā ||	"He is a rash and ruthless person: what have I to do with him, my dear friend, him who-merely for wiping away his faults-has learnt his coaxing-expressions?" 271 Here a certain good-quality-coaxing manner-is exhibited as a pseudo-fault by [the lady l who, through her love, is unable to assume the proud-resentment that her friends taught her to assume.

It was the feeling-of-pleasure that was illustrated before (ii.
rūpabāhulyayogena tadidaṃ rasavaicaḥ ||	this is love that has, by reason of the intensity of manifestation, developed into the Sentiment called the Amorous: this then is an illustration of the Impassioned.

Here the [king's] enthusiasm, assuming a pre-eminent form, abides as the Sentinent [called] the Heroic, and is [accordingly] able to establish the Impassioned nature of these expressions.
yasyāḥ kusumaśayyāpi komalāṅgayā rujākarī | sādhiśeṣe kathaṃ devi hutāśanavatī citām ||	"My Queen! Thou unto whom of delicate body even a flowery-bed caused pain: how dost thou [now] repose upon the flaming pyre ?" Here the Pathos being ebullient is regarded as the figure [called Impassioned].
