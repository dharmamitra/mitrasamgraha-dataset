Thereafter, with your thunderings prolonged by their being echoed (lit. caught up) by the mountain, do you make that Skanda's peacock dance, the outer corners of whose eyes are brightened by the lustre of Siva's moon, and whose moulted. feather, bearing circles of streaks of lustre, Bhavânî, out of affection for her son, places on her ear, usually the seat of a blue-lotus-petal (or, so as to make it come in contact with the lotus-petal resting there).

tasyāḥ pātuṃ suragaja iva vyomni paścārdhalambī / tvaṃ ced acchasphaṭikaviśadaṃ tarkayes tiryag ambhaḥ / saṃsarpantyā sapadi bhavataḥ srotasi cchāyayāsau / syād asthānopagatayamunāsaṃgamevābhirāmā //	Should you think of drinking her water, clear like transparent crystal, obliquely and remaining suspended from the sky by your hinder part, like a quarter-elephant, then by your image mirrored in the stream moving along, the river will at once appear as beautiful as if it were united with the Yamunâ at a place other than Prayâga.

Himalaya), white with snow and having its rocks scented by the musk of the deer squatting thereon, you seated on its peak for the removal of your fatigue, will possess, a beauty comparable to that of (a mass of) mud turned up by the white bull of the three-eyed God (Śiva).[ 12 ] If, while the wind blows, the wild fire, born of (gener- ated by) the friction of the branches of the Sarala trees, which destroys with its sparks the thick tails of the Chamaris, should do damage to it, it will be proper for you to extinguish it completely with thousands of water-showers; for the riches of the great have for their end the alleviation of the affliction of those in distress.

If then, O friend, you cannot procure your release from them in the hot season, you should frighten them, actively engaged in sports, with your thundering harsh to the ear.

Where clouds like you, led by the wind propelling them to the top-terraces of its seven-storied mansions, having done damage to the pictures (or, paintings) therein with the drops of their water, and being seized, as it were, with fear, the very moment escape through the lattices of windows, skilled in imitating the effusion of smoke and shattered into particles. Where, at midnight, the moon-stones pendent from the network of threads (fringing the ceiling) and shedding big drops of water under the influence of the lunar rays, bright on account of the disappearance of your obstruction entirely dispel the langour brought on by enjoyment to the bodies of women (when) released from the embraces of the arms of their lovers.

His work is accomplished by (the arrows in the form of) the sportive actions of clever women alone, which are never ineffective against sensual persons, their marks and in which glances are cast with knittings of the eye-brows.

On seeing you, O friend, with lightning flashing about you, I remember that very mountain, with a mind full of misgivings owing to its being a favourite of my wife.

The former longs, with me (like myself) for (a kick from the) left foot of your friend (my wife), and the latter for mouthfuls of wine from her under the pretext of a dohada (an operation necessary to cause them to bloom). And between these two there is a golden perch standing on a crystal-slab and having its basement built with gems (emeralds) having the sheen of young bamboos, on which roosts, at the close of the day, a peacock, a friend of your class, who is made to dance by my wife with clappings of hands, rendered pleasing by the jingling of her bracelets.

M. 2[ 18 ] The lady, who will be found there, slender-framed, youthful, with pointed teeth and her lower lip resembling a ripe bimba fruit, thin in the middle (waist), possessed of eyes like those of a frightened doe, having a deep navel, of a gait slow on account of the weight of her hips, slightly stooping on account of her breasts and the first creation, as it were, of the Creator in the department of woman-kind.—

Do you, therefore, stationed at the window of the mansion, at midnight see the good lady, sleepless and lying on the ground, that you may comfort her fully with messages from me;" -

Between 28-29, the follwing slokas are read by some- "Affectionate friends will not, under any circumstances, leave the slender-bodied one, during the day; for the behaviour of women in this world is of a uniform nature; you should, therefore, O cloud, wait at the window near her bed and approach my sleepless beloved at night when the servants are asleep." "(Her) resting on one side on the ground, serving as a bed, and to be found out by means of the drops of tears looking like portions of her broken pearl-necklace dropped about her; and pushing away again and again from her cheek, with her long-nailed (lit. with nails not cut) hand her single braid, hard and uneven (or, rugged) and to be loosened after- wards.[20]
