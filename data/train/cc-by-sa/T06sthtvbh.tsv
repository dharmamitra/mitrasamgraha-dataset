pudgaladharmanairātmyayor apratipannavipratipannānām aviparītapudgaladharmanairātmyapratipādanārthaṃ triṃśikāvijñaptiprakaraṇārambhaḥ /	The treatise Trimśikāvijnapti is composed to teach the truthful doctrine that both the person and the elements of existence have no underlying permanent being) to those who hold contrary or dissenting opinions about it.
pudgaladharmanairātmyapratipādanaṃ punaḥ kleśajñeyāvaraṇaprahāṇārtham /	The instruction on the two points mentioned serves to ensure that both the obstacles caused by the hereditary evils) and the obstacles) existing with regard to the objects of knowledge are given up.

dharmanairātmyajñānād api jñeyāvaraṇapratipakṣatvāt jñeyāvaraṇaṃ prahīyate /	The realization of the dharmanairātmya as the counterpart of the jneyāvarana) annuls the latter.

Since the inherited evils are the obstacle to attaining salvation, the latter is attained) after the abolition of the former.The jneyāvaraṇa is the ignorance unaccompanied by hereditary resentment, which prevents the exercise of knowledge with regard to all objects of cognition.
tasmin prahīṇe sarvākāre jñeye 'saktam apratihatañ ca jñānaṃ pravartata ity ataḥ sarvajñatvam adhigamyate /	For when the jneyāvarana is gone, knowledge engages in objects of knowledge of any kind without being attached to them or finding resistance, and thereby one attains omniscience.

This paper is written to refute both of these principled positions.

ātmadharmopacāra iti saṃbadhyate / ātmā dharmāś copacaryanta ity ātmadharmopacāraḥ / sa punar ātmaprajñaptir dharmaprajñaptiś ca /	'These' refers to the misconception or naming of self and elements of existence. The self and the elements of existence are wrongly conceived or named. This is the wrong conception or naming of self and elements of existence.

The misconception of self gives the idea of soul, individual, creature, man, etc. The wrong naming of elements of existence gives the groups, the constituents of personality, the Foundations of cognition, etc.Both misconception and naming are based only on modification of consciousness, but not on self and elements of existence as that primary.
kuta etat /	Why this?
dharmāṇām ātmanaś ca vijñānapariṇāmād bahir abhāvāt /	Because elements of existence and souls outside of the modification of consciousness do not last.
ko 'yaṃ pariṇāmo nāma /	What is such a modification?
anyathātvam /	A difference.
kāraṇakṣaṇanirodhasamakālaḥ kāraṇakṣaṇavilakṣaṇaḥ kāryasyātmalābhaḥ pariṇāmaḥ /	Modification is the coming-to-appearance of the effect, which is the one that occurs simultaneously with the disappearance of the cause-moment and is essentially different from it.
tatrātmādivikalpavāsanāparipoṣād rūpādivikalpavāsanāparipoṣāc cālayavijñānād ātmādinirbhāso vikalpo rūpādinirbhāsaś cotpadyate /	When the latent impressions of the imaginary ideas of soul etc. or matter etc. reach full maturity, then the imaginary idea arises from the primal consciousness.

Taking A for B gives the idea of B, which is here called mukhya primary; A is called gauņa secondary, see ff. named as something else if this is not identical to that; thus one says: the Punjabi is an ox, without that ox is identical with Punjabi. Now, because neither self nor elements of existence exist in consciousness as such and outside of it, they are conceptually constructed according to the principle set forth, but in rerum natura they are not; therefore the point of view that the objects of cognition are realiter just like consciousness is not to be approved. But since misapprehension or naming is not possible without an appropriate substratum, one must necessarily recognize the modification of consciousness as something real with which self and elements of being tend to be erroneously identified.And that is why the assertion that, like the objects of cognition, so also consciousness itself only exists on the basis of empirical appearance but not in reality, is not capable of any rational justification;
saṃvṛtito 'py abhāvaprasaṅgān na hi saṃvṛtir nirupādānā yujyate /	for it would logically follow that there is no 'on the basis of the empirical appearance' at all, for an empirical appearance without a positive basis is logically unthinkable.
tasmād ayam ekāntavādo dviprakāro 'pi niryuktikatvāt tyājya ity ācāryavacanam /	For this reason, both of the fundamental standpoints mentioned are to be rejected as devoid of any justification; so says the master.
evañ ca sarvaṃ vijñeyaṃ parikalpitasvabhāvatvād vastuto na vidyate vijñānaṃ punaḥ pratītyasamutpannatvād dravyato 'stīty abhyupeyam /	Hence one must assume that every content of consciousness as a purely conceptual entity has no real being; but consciousness possesses such a thing because it arose on the basis of certain conditions;
pratītyasamutpannatvaṃ punar vijñānasya pariṇāmaśabdena jñāpitam /	but the latter property of consciousness is designated by the word modification.
katham etad gamyate vinā bāhyenārthena vijñānam evārthākāram utpadyata iti /	How is it to be understood that a consciousness arises in the form of an object, without such being outside of svarūpa.
bāhyo hy arthaḥ svābhāsavijñānajanakatvena vijñānasyālambanapratyaya iṣyate na kāraṇatvamātreṇa samanantarādipratyayād viśeṣāprasaṅgāt /	The external object is valid, insofar as it causes the appearance of itself in consciousness, as an objective condition of consciousness and not simply as a cause, because otherwise it would not be necessary to consider the other conditions such as samanantara- to distinguish pratyaya.
sañcitālambanāś ca pañcavijñānakāyās tadākāratvāt /	The classes of sense perceptions have accumulated as object because they appear to us in this form.
na ca sañcitam avayavasaṃhatimātrād anyad vidyate / tadavayavān apohya sañcitākāravijñānābhāvāt /	Now accumulation is nothing but the accumulation of the parts; for when one subtracts the components, one has no consciousness in the form of "the accumulated".
tasmād vinaiva bāhyenārthena vijñānaṃ sañcitākāram utpadyate / na ca paramāṇava eva saṃcitās tasyālambanaṃ paramāṇūnām atadākāratvāt /	For the atoms in the aggregation attain no increase in their being compared with those in the individual. That is why the atoms, despite their accumulation, can no more become an “object” than all of them individually.
na hy asañcitāvasthātaḥ sañcitāvasthāyāṃ paramāṇūnāṃ kaścid ātmātiśayaḥ /	Another says: “Every single atom without relation to others is supersensible, but numerous related ones are perceptible to the senses”.
tasmād asañcitavat sañcitā api paramāṇavo naivālambanam /	For for a consciousness in which a certain content appears, no object of any other form can serve;
anyas tu manyate /	otherwise everything would be possible.
ekaika paramāṇur anyanirapekṣyo 'tīndriyo bahavas tu parasparāpekṣā indriyagrāhyāḥ /	Incidentally, there are just as few atoms in the highest sense, because they have a front, middle and back part.
teṣām api sāpekṣanirapekṣāvasthayor ātmātiśayābhāvād ekāntenendriyagrāhyatvam atīndriyatvaṃ vā / yadi ca paramāṇava eva parasparāpekṣā vijñānasya viṣayībhavanti /	Or if one does not want to admit this, the distinction of East, South, West, North do not apply to an atom, from which it would follow that the atom, like consciousness, is without form and location.
evaṃ sati yo 'yaṃ ghaṭakuḍyādyākārabhedo vijñāne sa na syāt praramāṇūnām atadākāratvāt / na cānyanirbhāsasya vijñānasyānyākāro viṣayo yujyate 'tiprasaṅgāt /	Accordingly, since there is no external opposition I.e. one who will not admit that there is no difference between the atoms combined and the atoms taken separately. I.e. every atom would have to contain that which, as a whole, brings about the perception in the form of a pot;
na ca paramāṇavaḥ stambhādivat paramārthataḥ santy/	likewise with 'wall' etc.Ie.
tadanabhyupagame vā pūrvadakṣiṇāparottarādidigbhedo yaḥ sa paramāṇor na syāt /	only an object that has the same form as that nirbhāsa can serve. In which case they would not be atoms, ie infinitesimally small (in our sense: without extension).
evaṃ bāhyārthābhāvād vijñānam evārthākāram utpadyate svapnavijñānavad ity abhyupeyam /	So probably identical with consciousness. If there is something, it is consciousness itself, which appears in the form of the object, like dream consciousness.
vedanādayo 'pi nātītānāgatās tadākāravijñānajanakā niruddhājātatvāt /	As the first of the mental elements, vedanā is named sensation, cf. CC p. I.e. are no longer or not yet available.

[Tvbh_46] utpannāvasthāyāṃ vijñānasyāpi tadākāreṇotpannatvān na kiñcit kartavyam astīti manovijñānam apy anālambanam evotpadyate /	The vartamānā vedanā here seems to be broken down into two moments, in the first it is utpadyamānā, ie it is coming but is not there yet, in the second it is utpannā, but the vijnana of the same kşaņa is then already vartamānākāra.
anyas tv āha /	above.
asaty ātmani mukhye dharmeṣu copacāro na yujyate /	As can be seen from the course of the discussion, the Yogācāra does not accept this distinction; for him, even the primary is in principle secondary.
upacāro hi triṣu satsu bhavati nānyatamābhāve mukhyapadārthe tatsadṛśe 'nyasmin viṣaye tayoś ca sādṛśye /	One of the three: namely the primary object, another object similar to that, and the similarity of these two.
tad yathā mukhye 'gnau tatsadṛśe ca māṇavake tayoś ca sādhāraṇe dharme kapilatve tīkṣṇatve vā saty agnir māṇavaka ity upacāraḥ kriyate / atra hy agnir māṇavaka iti jātir dravyaṃ vopacaryate /	So e.g. B. the transference 'the fellow is fire' takes place when the following are given: the primary fire, the fellow like him, and a quality common to both, be it red color or fierceness.' In the case: 'the fellow is fire', the fire is transmitted either a) as a genus or b) as an individual.
ubhayathāpy upacārābhāvaḥ /	Either way, transmission is impossible.
tatra tāvan na jāteḥ sādhāraṇaṃ kapilatvaṃ tīkṣṇatvaṃ vā / na ca sādhāraṇadharmābhāve māṇavake jāter upacāro yujyate 'tiprasaṅgāt / ataddharmatve 'pi jātes tīkṣṇatvakapilatvayor jātyavinābhāvitvān māṇavake jātyupacāro bhaviṣyati /	a) The gender does not have the common quality 'redness' or 'violence' (but the real fire), and in the absence of a common quality the gender cannot be transferred to the boy, because otherwise everything and everyone on him could be transferred.The opponent says: 'Even if the genus itself does not possess the quality of redness or intensity, it always occurs in connection with the genus, and so it becomes a transference of the genus to be the boy.'
jātyabhāve 'pi tīkṣṇatvakapilatvayor māṇavake darśanād avinābhāvitvam ayuktam /	(Response:) But one still sees fierceness or blushing in the lad, even when the gender is not present, so the Stetsin-connection-occurrence does not apply;
avinābhāvitve copacārābhāvo 'gnāv iva māṇavake 'pi jātisadbhāvāt /	but if this were the case, then there would be no transmission, because like fire, so too the boy would have the genus eo ipso.
tasmān na māṇavake jātyupacāraḥ saṃbhavati /	Therefore the transmission of genus to the boy is impossible.
nāpi dravyopacāraḥ sāmānyadharmābhāvāt /	b) The transmission of the individual is also not possible because there is no common property;
na hi yo 'gnes tīkṣṇo guṇaḥ kapilo vā sa eva māṇavake /	I.e. avinābhavitva exists between agni and agnitva, but not between these and mânavaka or māṇavakatva.
kiṃ tarhi tato 'nyaḥ / viśeṣasya svāśrayapratibaddhatvān na vināgniguṇenāgner māṇavake upacāro yuktaḥ /	Whose quality (as individually peculiar to him) is different from that; because each particularity (special or individual quality) is bound to its substratum, the transmission of fire to the fellow without the (special) quality of fire is impossible.
agniguṇasādṛśyād yukta iti cet / evam apy agniguṇasyaiva tīkṣṇasya kapilasya vā māṇavakaguṇe tīkṣṇe kapile vā sādṛśyād upacāro yukto na tu māṇavake 'gner guṇasādṛśyenāsaṃbandhāt	If the opponent asserts that it is possible because the quality of fire is similar (to that of the fellow), (we reply): if it were so, that blush or intensity, which is the quality of fire, could refer to that blush or fierceness, which is the fellow's quality, because of the resemblance (between these two qualities), but not to the fellow himself, because the fire is unrelated to the resemblance of his quality.
tasmād dravyopacāro 'pi naiva yujyate /	Therefore, a transfer of the individual is not possible.
mukhyo 'pi padārtho naivāsti tatsvarūpasya sarvajñānābhidhānaviṣayātikrāntatvāt / pradhāne hi guṇarūpeṇaiva jñānābhidhāne pravartete tatsvarūpāsaṃsparśāt /	There is no primary object at all, because its true nature lies beyond our knowledge and ability to express.For thinking and speaking only function with regard to the primary insofar as it appears in a secondary form, because they do not reach the true essence of that;
anyathā ca guṇavaiyarthyaprasaṅgaḥ /	if it were otherwise, the secondary would have no purpose.

evaṃ yāvac chabde saṃbandhābhāvāj jñānābhidhānābhāva evañ cābhidhānābhidheyābhāvān naiva mukhyaḥ padārtho 'sti /	What they are paramarthataḥ as parinişpannasvabhāva, ie as things in themselves, is unknowable to us.
api ca sarva evāyaṃ gauṇa eva na mukhyo 'sti /	the secondary is known to us, there is no primary for us.
gauṇo hi nāma yo yatrāvidyamānena rūpeṇa pravartate /	Namely, secondary is what is applied to something in an unreal form;
sarvaś ca śabdaḥ pradhāne 'vidyamānenaiva guṇarūpeṇa pravartate ato mukhyo nāsty eva /	and each word is applied to the primary only in an unreal form. Therefore there is no primary at all.
tatra yad uktaṃ asaty ātmani mukhye dharmeṣu copacāro na yukta iti tad ayuktam /	Consequently, the opponent's above assertion: 'If there were no primary self nor primary elements of existence, the transference would not be possible' is entirely untenable.
vijñānapariṇāmaḥ kati prabheda iti na jñāyate / atas tatprabhedopadarśanārtham āha / pariṇāmaḥ sa ca tridhā // 1d	Since it is not yet known how many modes of modification of consciousness there are, the author says, to teach their main modes: and the modification is threefold, whereupon the transference of a self and that of elements of existence takes place.
yatrātmādyupacāro dharmopacāraś ca sa punar hetubhāvena phalabhāvena ca bhidyate /	And this modification is different as causal or as effected.

It means the secondary, e.g. B. with rūpa the relevant vijnanapariņāma.
tatra pravṛttivijñānaṃ kuśalākuśalam ālayavijñāne vipākavāsanāṃ niṣyandavāsanāñ cādhatte /	This uniform development, ie continuously the same existence, does not take place when the influence of morally good or bad deeds asserts itself.
avyākṛtaṃ kliṣṭañ ca mano niṣyandavāsanām eva /	These bring about a change in one's internal state, a maturation of action, which is called vipākṛṣṇa.
vipāko mananākhyaś ca vijñaptir viṣayasya ca / 2ab	When the vipaka is realized, it determines the external condition of the doer, be it at a later birth, be it in life as luck or misfortune.

ālayākhyam ity ālayavijñānasaṃjñakaṃ yad vijñānaṃ sa vipākapariṇāmaḥ /	The term 'store-room' means: the consciousness termed alayavijnana is the modification of karmic effect.

atha vālīyante upanibadhyante 'smin sarvadharmāḥ kāryabhāvena tad vālīyate upanibadhyate kāraṇabhāvena sarvadharmeṣv ity ālayaḥ /	The last six of the eighteen dhātus, cf. CC p. samkleśika CN p. lung aliyante 'to cling to', upanibadhyante 'to cling'; or that which clings to all dharmas as the cause of action.
vijānātīti vijñānam /	'Consciousness' because it knows.
sarvadhātugatiyonijātiṣu kuśalākuśalakarmavipākatvād vipākaḥ / sarvadharmabījāśrayatvāt sarvabījakam /	'Karma effect' because it is the effect of good and bad karma in all worlds, classes of beings, the special family and the tribe concerned.That contains the germs of everything', because it is the substratum for the germs of all dharmas.
yadi pravṛttivijñānavyatiriktam ālayavijñānam asti tato 'syālambanam ākāro vā vaktavyaḥ /	If there is an alayavijnana besides the pravṛttivijnanas, then its 'object' or 'form' must be pointed out.
na hi nirālambanaṃ nirākāraṃ vā vijñānaṃ yujyate / naiva tan nirālambanaṃ nirākāraṃ veṣyate /	For consciousness without 'object' and 'form' is not possible; In no way do we demand such a thing, but rather a consciousness whose 'object' and 'form' remain unrecognized.
kiṃ kāraṇam /	Why?
yasmād ālayavijñānaṃ dvidhā pravartate / adhyātmam upādānavijñaptito bahirdhāparicchinnākārabhājanavijñaptitaś ca /	Because the alayavijnana operates in two directions: towards the subject through pretense of the material, outwardly through pretense of the scene whose form remains unrecognized.
tatrādhyātmam upādānaṃ parikalpitasvabhāvābhiniveśavāsanā sādhiṣṭhānam indriyarūpaṃ nāma ca /	The material with regard to the subject is the latent impression left behind by the persistently practiced imagining of things of imaginary essence, the indriya together with its seat, matter and mind.
asyālambanasyātisūkṣmatvād	Because this object is of extreme delicacy,
asaṃviditakopādisthānavijñaptikañ ca tat / 3ab	The alayavijnana is not considered in cognition; that is the task of the pravrttivijnanas.
asaṃviditaka upādir yasmin asaṃviditakā ca sthānavijñaptir yasmin tad ālayavijñānam asaṃviditakopādisthānavijñaptikam / upādānam upādiḥ /	In it, both the material upadi and the presentation of a location remain unconscious. This is what the alayavijnana is called, in which both the material and the presentation of a location remain unconscious.Upadi is upadana.

āśrayopādānañ copādiḥ / āśraya ātmabhāvaḥ sādhiṣṭhānam indriyarūpaṃ nāma ca /	Upadi is also appropriation of the substrate, by which is meant the individual existence, the indriya with its seat the body, matter and spirit namarupa.
tasya punar yad upādānam upagamanam ekayogakṣematvena tad upādiḥ /	The appropriation of it, the devotion to it as something absolutely similar is upadi.

tat punar upādānam idantayā pratisaṃvedayitum aśakyam ity ato 'saṃvidita ity ucyate /	ekayogakşematvena. In philosophical language one encounters the expression tulyayogakşematvät in the meaning 'because it behaves quite similarly' e.g. B. Syadvadamanjari.
sthānavijñaptir bhājanalokasaṃniveśavijñaptiḥ /	The presentation of the location is that of the design of the setting and the world in question.
sāpy aparicchinnālambanākārapravṛttatvād asaṃviditety ucyate /	This too is called unconscious because it occurs without the object and form of it being recognized.

anyavijñānavādinām api nirodhasamāpattyādyavasthāsu tulyam etat / na ca nirodhasamāpattyādyavasthāsu vijñānaṃ naivāstīti śakyate pratipattum /	The same difficulty also exists for those who believe only in the other 'consciousness' regarding nirodhasamāpatti and other states.Nor can it be assumed that there is no consciousness in these at all, because it is contrary to reason and the Sutra.
tatrālayākhyaṃ vijñānam (2c) ity uktaṃ vijñānañ cāvaśyaṃ caittaiḥ saṃprayuktam ity ato vaktavyaṃ katamaiḥ katibhiś ca tebhyaḥ saṃprayujyate /	Since the alayavijnana is a vijnāna and as such is necessarily accompanied by mental elements, it must now be explained by which and how many mental elements it is always accompanied, and whether or not it is always accompanied by them.

tatra sparśas trikasaṃnipāte indriyavikāraparicchedaḥ / vedanāsaṃniśrayadānakarmakaḥ /	Sensation is the cognition of the change of the sense organ occurring at the meeting of the trinity, which produces the basis of feeling.
indriyaviṣayavijñānāni trīṇy eva trikam /	The trinity is the three elements: sense organ, object and consciousness;
tasya kāryakāraṇabhāvena samavasthānaṃ trikasaṃnipātaḥ /	when these are together in a causal relationship, it is the coincidence of the Trinity.

indriyaṃ punar yena viśeṣeṇa sukhaduḥkhādihetutvaṃ pratipadyate sa tasya vikāraḥ /	But the change in the sense organ is that property of it by which it becomes the cause of pleasure, suffering, and so on.

vedanāsaṃniśrayatvam asya karma /	Its effect is to be the basis for feeling.
evaṃ hy uktaṃ sūtre sukhavedanīyaṃ sparśaṃ pratītyotpadyate sukhaṃ veditam iti vistaraḥ /	For this is what the Sūtra says: 'Depending on the sparsa to be felt as bliss, bliss arises as that which is felt', etc. The theory discussed here about sparśa, with which CC p. is not entirely transparent and clear.
manaskāraś cetasa ābhogaḥ /	Attention is the bending of the mind, whereby it is turned to its object.
ālambane yena cittam abhimukhīkriyate /	It causes the mind to become stuck to its object.
cittadhāraṇaṃ punas tatraivālambane punaḥ punaś cittasyāvarjanam /	The mind's fixation consists in focusing it again and again on its object.

vedanā anubhavasvabhāvā /	Feeling is essentially awareness.
sā punar viṣayasyāhlādakaparitāpakatadubhayākāraviviktasvarūpasākṣātkaraṇabhedāt tridhā bhavati / sukhā / duḥkhā / aduḥkhāsukhā ca /	According as the object is perceived as pleasurable, painful, or of a nature distinct from these two forms, the feeling is threefold: pleasant, unpleasant, neither pleasant nor unpleasant.

atra cālayavijñānam eva śubhāśubhakarmavipākaḥ /	But the alayavijnana itself is the karmic effect of right and wrong actions;

tatra sukho 'nubhavo yasminn utpanne viyogecchā niruddhe ca punaḥ saṃyogecchā jāyate / duḥkho 'nubhavo yasminn utpanne viyogecchā niruddhe ca punar asaṃyogecchā / aduḥkhāsukho yasminn utpanne niruddhe cobhyaṃ na jāyate /	Pleasant awareness is from which one does not wish to be separated once it has occurred, to be reconnected to it once it has ceased; uncomfortable awareness is the state in which both are inversely related; is neither unpleasant nor pleasant awareness when neither occurs nor ceases.
saṃjñā viṣayanimittodgrahaṇam /	Concept is the apprehension of a peculiarity of the object.
nimittaṃ tadviśeṣo nīlapītādyālambanavyavasthākāraṇam / tasyodgrahaṇaṃ nirūpaṇaṃ nīlam etan na pītam iti /	The subject is the object, and peculiarity is a peculiarity of it, which causes the object to be recognized precisely as 'black', 'yellow', etc.Its apprehension is the recognition 'this is black, not yellow'.

Therefore he says: The feeling in him is indifference, and it itself is undisguised neutral.
tatrety ālayavijñānam eva prakṛtatvāt saṃbadhyate /	Since the alayavijnana is dealt with here, 'in him' refers to the same thing.

tatrānivṛtagrahaṇaṃ nivṛtavyavacchedārtham / avyākṛtagrahaṇaṃ kuśalākuśalavyavacchedārtham /	It is referred to as 'unveiled' to exclude 'veiled'; and 'neutral' to exclude 'good' and 'evil'. It is unveiled' because it is not covered by the purely spiritual faults that come and go.
manobhūmikair āgantukair upakleśair anāvṛtatvād anivṛtam /	The ten vicious elements of limited occurrence are purely mental insofar as they do not occur with the panca-vijnāna-kāyas, and 'come and go', so are limited in their occurrence and duration.
vipākatvād vipākaṃ prati kuśalākuśalatvenāvyākaraṇād avyākṛtam /	The impact is not differentiated in terms of good and bad.

na hi tad ekam abhinnam anuvartate kṣaṇikatvāt / kiṃ tarhi / tac ca vartate srotasaughavat // 4d	It is not unitary and undivided because It is momentary, but It is in perpetual flux like a river.
tac cety ālayavijñānam eva saṃbadhyate /	'It' refers to the alayavijnana.
tatra sroto hetuphalayor nairantaryaprabandhena pravṛttiḥ /	'Constant Flow' is the uninterrupted progression of cause and effect.
udakasamūhasya pūrvāparabhāgāvicchedena pravāha ogha ity ucyate /	The flow of a mass of water that occurs without breaking between the front and rear parts is called a stream.

tasyaivaṃ śrotasā pravṛttasya kasyām avasthāyāṃ vyāvṛttir ity āha /	In what state does the alayavijnana, so in perpetual flux, come to an end?
tasya vyāvṛttir arhattve / 5a	To which he replies: His end is in Arhattum.

yadyogād arhann ity ucyate /	That by the attainment of which one is called an arhat.
kasya punar yogād arhann ity ucyate /	And by attaining what is one called an arhat?

tasyāṃ hy avasthāyām ālayavijñānāśritadauṣṭhulyaniravaśeṣaprahāṇād ālayavijñānaṃ vyāvṛttaṃ bhavati /	For it is in this state that the alayavijnana reaches its end after the complete elimination of the unfitness based on it and this state is the arhattum.
uktaḥ savibhaṅgo vipākapariṇāmaḥ /	The modification of consciousness, the effect of karma together with its cancellation has been dealt with.
idānīṃ mananākhyāṃ dvitīyaṃ pariṇāmam āha /	Now he discusses the second modification, which is contemplation.
tatra yathā cakṣurādivijñānānāṃ cakṣurādaya āśrayatvena rūpādayaś cālambanatvena prasiddhā naiva kliṣṭasya manasa āśraya ālambanaṃ vā prasiddham	Relying on it comes forth' etc. As for sight etc. sight etc. are fixed as seat and color etc. as object in the same way the seat and object of the contaminated inner sense are not fixed.Now consciousness without relation to seat and object is impossible.
na ca vijñānam āśrayālambananirapekṣaṃ yujyata ity ataḥ kliṣṭasya manasa āśrayālambanapratipādanārthaṃ niruktipratipādanārthañ cāha /	Therefore he says, in order to teach the seat and object of the contaminated inner sense as well as its explanation of the word: Relying on it it comes forth having as its object the consciousness called inner sense', which consists in contemplation.
tad āśritya pravartate /	Here jnana seems to mean transcendental knowledge.

According to CN p. 3 it is equal to sarvajnata, prajna-paramita ua Kshaya-jnana would be such a knowledge of a world in which there is impermanence, ie causality Abh.

With asraya are meant the ayatana : cakşurindriya to kayendriya, and with alambana their visaya, ayatana : rupayatana to sprastavyayatana, CC f.I suspect that this expression has a similar meaning to the conjunction of the absolutive with the. In the phrase 'relying on it comes forth' the word 'on it' refers to the alayavijnana. Namely, the seat of the latent impressions of it is the ālayavijnana; therefore, resting on it, it comes forth, ie, arises as a chain. Or one can also explain in the following way: To which world and to which level an alayavijnana belongs, the same world and level also belongs to the corresponding contaminated inner sense; therefore he comes forth resting on that, because his existence is firmly connected with that. Having it as an object', the alayavijnāna is its object, because because of the connection with the delusion of a permanent personality, etc. The alayavijnana in the conception of 'I' and 'mine' is its object. But how can the same mind from which inner sense arises also be its object? Just as for those who do not accept the alayavijnana, in any state the manovijnana arises with the very mind as the object from which it itself arose.The consciousness called inner sense.
manonāma vijñānam iti mana iti nāma ākhyā yasya vijñānasya tad ālayavijñānam āśritya pravarte tadālambanaṃ ca manonāmety anenālayavijñānāt pravṛttivijñānāc ca vyavacchinatti /	Consciousness, whose name is inner sense, is based on the alayavijnāna and has this for its object. By the addition 'whose name is inner sense', this consciousness is distinguished from both the alayavijnana and the pravṛttivijnāna.
tat punaḥ kiṃ svabhāvam ity āha / mananātmakam iti /	But what its essence is, that says (the attribute): which consists in contemplation'.
evaṃ mananātmakatvān mana ity ucyate nairūktena vidhinā /	Because it consists in contemplation (manana), it is called inner sense (manas) by etymology.

NBT, by which and how many or for how long he is accompanied, he says: He is always accompanied by four veiled-neutral hereditary evils, namely the spiritual elements can be divided into two classes, in hereditary evils and divide the rest; to exclude the rest, he says: 'of the hereditary evils'.
kleśā api ṣaṭ / na ca taiḥ saṃprayujyate 'taś caturbhir ity āha /	The hereditary evil there are six; he is not accompanied by all of them, that's why he says 'of four'.

nivṛtāḥ kliṣṭatvāt / avyākṛtāḥ kuśalākuśalatvenāvyākaraṇāt /	They are 'veiled' because they are defiled and 'neutral' because they are not differentiated in terms of good and evil.

The latent impression of both illusions, however, becomes a contributing cause for the latent impressions of all karma, which according to their kind are active in the production of the effected existence, such as the sun etc. in the emergence of the seedling.

In the final moment of the time of action of earlier karma, the latent impressions of karma, in conjunction with those of both illusions, produce in the alayavijnana, according to their strength, a different karma effect than the one just consumed; for there is then no other consciousness than the alayavijnana.
kṣīṇe pūrvavipāka ity anena śāśvatāntaṃ pariharati / anyaṃ vipākaṃ janayantīty ucchedāntam /	With the words after the previous karma effects have dwindled he rejects the doctrine of the permanence of the soul, and with the words they bring about another karma effect in him the doctrine of their cessation at death.

If one denies an ālayavijnana, one could either assume a pratisandhi-vijnana caused by the samskāras or the six categories of consciousness fully filled by the samskāras. Those samskaras responsible for pratisandhi, which are regarded as the cause of vijnana, have long since been suppressed, what is suppressed is not there; and something that is not cannot be a cause; therefore pratisandhi-vijnana caused by the samskāras is not possible. But in pratisandhi there is also nämarūpa, not just vijnana. What evidence is there that only the vijnana is caused by the samskaras, not nāmarūpa? Therefore it must be said that nāmarūpa is caused by the samskāras, but not the vijnana. What other nãmarūpa should be caused by vijnana? A later one? But what plus in its nature does it have over the one responsible for the pratisandhi that it should be caused by the vijnana, not the earlier, and the earlier should be caused by the samskāras and not the later? Therefore, as caused by the samskāras, nāmarupa is to be considered, to which an imaginary middle term pratisandhivijnana.Therefore, pratisandhi-vijnana induced by the samskaras is not possible.
saṃskāraparibhāvitā vā ṣaḍvijñānakāyā api na saṃskārapratyayaṃ vijñānaṃ yujyate /	The six categories of consciousness fully filled by the samskaras are also not possible as the consciousness caused by the samskaras.
kiṃ kāraṇam /	Why?
na hi vijñānaṃ vipākavāsanāṃ niṣyandavāsanāṃ vā svātmany ādhātuṃ samarthaṃ svātmani kāritravirodhāt /	For the vijnana is not able to lay down in itself the latent impression of karmic effect and that of uniform development because it is a logical contradiction that something in itself produces something;
nāpy anāgate tasya tadānutpannatvāt /	nor in a future vijnana, because that at that time had not yet arisen and the unarisen is not;
nāpy utpanne pūrvasya tadā niruddhatvāt /	nor in an existing one, because at that time it was already un.

saṃsāranivṛttir api ālayavijñāne asati na yujyate /	Also the cessation of samsara is not possible if there is no alayavijnana.
saṃsārasya hi karmakleśāś ca kāraṇaṃ tayoś ca kleśāḥ pradhānam /	Namely, the cause of samsara is karma and the klesas, and of these, the klesas are the main factor.
tathā hi kleśādhipatyāt karma punarbhavākṣepasamarthaṃ bhavati nānyathā /	Because the klesas are efficient cause, the karma becomes capable of bringing about rebirth in no other way.
tathākṣiptapunarbhavo 'pi karma kleśādhipatyād eva punarbhavo bhavati nānyathā / evañ ca kleśā eva saṃsārapravṛtteḥ pradhānatvān mūlam /	And so the rebirth-causing karma becomes rebirth just because the klesas are the efficient cause, in no other way. And in this way the klesas as the main factor are the mula of the continuation of samsara.
atas teṣu prahīṇeṣu saṃsāro vinivartate nānyathā / na cālayavijñānam antareṇa tatprahāṇaṃ yujyate /	Therefore, when these have disappeared, samsara ceases, in no other way. And their disappearance is not possible without the alayavijnana.
kathaṃ punar na yujyate /	But why isn't that possible?
saṃmukhībhūto vā kleśaḥ prahīyate bījāvastho vā /	A klesa fades away either when it is about to be realized or while it is still in the germ state.
tatprahāṇamārgasthānād bījāvastho 'pi naiva prahīyate /	Nobody accepts the former.But even in the germ state of those who linger on the path of annihilation it does not disappear.

But that to which the kleśa-seed is attached cannot be opposed to the kleśa-seed, and samsāra does not cease for those whose kleśa-seed has not yet disappeared.

yad vastu vikalpyaviṣayas tad yasmāt sattābhāvān na vidyate / tasmāt tad vastu parikalpitasvabhāvam eva / na hetupratyayapratibaddhasvabhāvam /	Because a thing which is the object of imaginary conception does not exist for lack of true being, therefore that thing is of imaginary svabhāva only, not one based on causal condition.

ata eva sa naivānyo nānanyaḥ paratantrataḥ / 22ab	Therefore it is neither another nor any other than the paratantra.
sā ca dharmatā dharmān nānyā nānanyā yujyate / pariniṣpannaś ca paratantradharmatety ataḥ paratantrāt pariniṣpanno nānyo nānanya iti boddhavyaḥ /	The absolute is the paratantra's constant freedom from the imaginary character.The absolute is the dharmatã of the paratantra, from which it can be inferred that the parinişpanna is 'neither another nor not another' than the paratantra.
yadi hi pariniṣpannaḥ paratantrād anyaḥ syād evaṃ na parikalpitena paratantraḥ śūnyaḥ syāt /	For if it were other than the paratantra, it could not be entirely free of the imaginary.
athānanya evam api pariniṣpanno na viśuddhālambanaḥ syāt paratantravat saṃkleśātmakatvāt /	on this assumption, the parinişpanna could not have a pure object because, like the paratantra, it would be contaminated by the kleśas;

ataḥ pariniṣpanne 'dṛṣṭe paratantro na dṛśyate /	Therefore, if the absolute is not seen, the relative is not seen;

yadi dravyam eva paratantraḥ kathaṃ sūtre sarvadharmā niḥsvabhāvā anutpannā aniruddhā iti nirdiśyante /	If the relative is an reality, how is it that in the Sutra all dharmas are described as insubstantial, unarisen, unsuppressed?
nāsti virodhaḥ yasmāt / trividhasya svabhāvasya trividhāṃ niḥsvabhāvatām / sandhāya sarvadharmāṇāṃ deśitā niḥsvabhāvatā // 23	There is no contradiction in this, for: Referring to the threefold immateriality of the three characters, the immateriality of all dharmas is taught.
traya eva svabhāvā na caturtho 'stīti jñāpanārthaṃ saṃkhyānirdeśaḥ /	To indicate that there are only three characters, not a fourth, the number is given.
trividhā niḥsvabhāvatā lakṣaṇaniḥsvabhāvatā utpattiniḥsvabhāvatā paramārthaniḥsvabhāvatā ca /	Since each is afflicted with its special characteristic like a being, there is a threefold essentiality, that of the characteristic, that of origin, that of supreme being.
sarvadharmāḥ parikalpitaparatantrapariniṣpannātmakāḥ /	All dharmas have an imaginary, relative or absolute nature.
idānīṃ trividhasya svabhāvasya yā yasya niḥsvabhāvatā tāṃ tasya pradarśayann āha /	Now he shows the inanimate nature of each of the three characters.

rūpalakṣaṇaṃ rūpam /	The first is the imaginary character;
anubhavalakṣaṇā vedanetyādi /	and this is insubstantial because its attribute is fictitious: matter has as attribute proving, sensation has as attribute perception.
ataś ca svarūpābhāvāt khapuṣpavat svarūpeṇaiva niḥsvabhāvaḥ /	And because there is no essence of its own, as in the case of the air-flower, the imaginary character is without essence in relation to its own essence.
aparaḥ punar iti paratantrasvabhāvaḥ / na svayaṃbhāva etasya māyāvat parapratyayenotpatteḥ /	But the other, that is the relative character, he has no being of his own because he arises, like a trick, through another cause.
dharmāṇāṃ paramārthaś ca sa yatas tathāpi sa iti / (25ab) paramaṃ hi lokottarajñānaṃ niruttaratvāt tasyārthaḥ paramārthaḥ /	Because its origin is different from what is recognized, its essentiality is that of origin. That from which, etc., namely the highest is the transcendent cognition, because beyond that there is no higher one; whose object is the highest object.

kiṃ punaḥ paramārthābhidhānenaiva pariniṣpanno 'bhidhātavyaḥ /	But should one designate the absolute by the name of paramartha?
nety āha / kiṃ tarhi	He denies that;

To be read like this after Stcherbatsky instead of rupa.
tathatā / tathā hi pṛthagjanaśaikṣāśaikṣāvasthāsu sarvakālaṃ tathaiva bhavati /	Tathata. For in the states of the common man, the disciple, and the beginner, he is always the same, not different;
nānyatheti tathatety ucyate /	therefore it is called suchness.
kiṃ punas tathatāvat pariniṣpanna eva vijñaptimātratā /	But what is suchness? Is the absolute character as such itself the vijnaptimatratā, or is there another?
saiva vijñaptimātratā // 25d	He answers: She is the vijnaptimatratā.
suviśuddhalakṣaṇāvabodhād yathoktam / nāmni tiṣṭhati tac cittaṃ tadā tanmātradarśanāt /	Because it is cognition of a thoroughly pure nature.Thus it is said: "When consciousness is only nominal, then because it sees truth and has only nominal existence, perception in the vijnapti disappears."
nopalambhaṃ tadā dhātuṃ spṛśate bhāvanānvayāt /	"Then reality of the citta stirs no longer in perception because of its connection with concentration;
