samād api hi labdhaarthād viśvas tasya bhayaṃ bhavet // jyāyastve caapi labdhaarthaḥ samoapi parikalpate /	Though actuated with feelings of true friendship, the conqueror has reason to fear his ally, though of equal power, when the latter attains success in his mission; having succeeded in his mission, an ally of equal power is likely to change his attitude even towards the conqueror of superior power

My teacher say that a rich land with a constant enemy is Kautilyas Arthashastra 0 better, inasmuch as it yields much wealth to maintain a strong army, by which the enemy can be put down

A limited tract of land with water is far better than a vast plain, inasmuch as the former is conducive to the growth of crops and fruits throughout the year Of plains, that which is conducive to the growth of both early and late crops and which requires less labour and less rain for cultivation is better than the other of reverse character

The former is better inasmuch as it can be kept under control and is not susceptible to the intrigues of enemys while the latter is Kautilyas Arthashastra intolerant of calamities and susceptible, of anger and other passions In colonizing a land with four castes, colonization with the lowest caste is better, inasmuch as it is serviceable in various ways, plentiful, and permanent

The king who is desirous of getting back the land sold for colonization to another when the latter has lost his men and money in colonizing it, should first make an agreement with such a purchaser as is weak, baseborn, devoid of energy, helpless, of unrighteous character, addicted to evil ways, trusting to fate, and indiscreet in his actions
