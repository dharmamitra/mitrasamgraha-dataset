arvāgbhāgasya ca grahaṇaṃ parabhāgasya cāgrahaṇaṃ yugapan na syāt /	There could be no apprehension of a nearer "part of something" and a non-apprehension of a more removed "part", simultaneously.
na hi tasyaiva tadānīṃ grahaṇaṃ cāgrahaṇaṃ ca yuktam /	For a concurrent apprehension and non-apprehension of the same thing isn't logical.
vicchinnasya cānekasya hastyaśvādikasyaikatra vṛttir na syād yatraiva hy ekaṃ tatraivāparam iti kathaṃ tayor viccheda iṣyate /	There would be no special development for species that are separate, such as elephants, horses, etc. and since they would all be one in that case, how could their separation be accepted?
kathaṃ vā tad ekaṃ yat prāptaṃ ca tābhyāṃ na ca prāptam antarāle tac chūnyagrahaṇāt /	And how can they be accepted as single, anyway, since there is the apprehension of an empty space between two of them?
sūkṣmāṇāṃ caudakajantūnāṃ sthūlaiḥ samānarūpāṇām anīkṣaṇaṃ na syād /	And there would be no reason for the non-seeing of subtle water-beings, since they would be visible in common with the more apparent.
yadi lakṣaṇabhedād eva dravyāntaratvaṃ kalpyate nānyathā / tasmād avaśyaṃ paramāṇuśo bhedaḥ kalpayitavyaḥ /	An otherness in entities is constructed if there is a division of characteristics, and not otherwise, so when speaking from the atomic point of view, one must by necessity construct divisions, and it cannot be demonstrated that they (the atoms) are in any way of one kind.
tasyāsiddhau rūpādīnāṃ cakṣurādiviṣayatvam asiddham iti siddhaṃ vijñaptimātraṃ bhavatīti //	With their unity undemonstrated, visibles', etc.'s state of being sense-objects of the eye, etc. is also undemonstrated, and thus perception-only is demonstrated.

But with an object of sense or understanding not existing, how can there be any cognizing which can, be termed "direct perception" ?
pratyakṣabuddhiḥ svapnādau yathā vināpy artheneti pūrvam eva jñāpitaṃ	Cognizing by direct perception is like in a dream, etc. a For it is without an object of sense or understanding, as has been made known previously.

uktaṃ yathā tadābhāsā vijñaptiḥ	Because It has been stated how perception occurs with its appearance.
vināpy arthena yathārthābhāsā cakṣurvijñānādikā vijñaptir utpadyate tathoktaṃ /	a It has already been stated how perceptions in the shape of eyeconsciousnesses, etc. arise with the appearance of an object, even without there being any (external) object of sense or understanding.
smaraṇaṃ tataḥ /	And remembering takes place from that.
tato hi vijñapteḥ smṛtisaṃprayuktā tatpratibhāsaiva rūpādivikalpikā manovijñaptir utpadyata iti na smṛtyutpādād arthānubhavaḥ sidhyati /	b "From that" means "from the perception". A mental perception arises with the discrimination of a visible, etc. when that appearance is linked with memory, so an experience of an (external) object can't be demonstrated through the arising of a memory.
yadi yathā svapne vijñaptir abhūtārthaviṣayā tathā jāgrato 'pi syāt tathaiva tadabhāvaṃ lokaḥ svayam avagacchet /	Objection: If, even when one is awake, perception has sense-objects which weren't, like in a dream, then people would understand their non-being by themselves.
na caivaṃ bhavati /	But that isn't the case.
tasmān na svapna ivārthopalabdhiḥ sarvā nirarthikā /	So it's not that the apprehension of objects is like in a dream, and all perceptions are really without an (external) object.
idam ajñāpakaṃ / yasmāt / svapnadṛgviṣayābhāvaṃ nāprabuddho 'vigacchati //	Reply This argument won't bring us to the cognition you : wish, because Somebody who isn't awake doesn't understand the nonbeing of the visual sense-objects in a dream.

anyonyādhipatitvena vijñaptiniyamo mithaḥ /	Reply: The certainty of perceptions takes place mutually, by the state of their sovereign effect on one another.
sarveṣāṃ hi sattvānām anyonyavijñaptyādhipatyena mitho vijñapter niyamo bhavati yathāyogaṃ /	a For all beings there is certainty of perception through a mutual sovereign effect of perceptions on one another, according to circumstances¹.
mitha iti parasparataḥ /	"Mutually" means "each affecting the other".
ataḥ saṃtānāntaravijñaptiviśeṣāt saṃtānāntare vijñaptiviśeṣa utpadyate nārthaviśeṣāt /	So one special perception arises within a moment-series through a special perception within the moment-series, and not because of a special object.

Reply: Because Citta is affected by torpor in a dream, so their results are different.
idam atra kāraṇāṃ na tv arthasadbhāvaḥ // yadi vijñāptimātram evedaṃ na kasyacit kāyo 'sti na vāk //	b This is the reason, not the existing being of an (external) object.The Twenty Verses and Their Commentary Objection If all this is perception-only, there can't be body or speech for anybody.
katham upakramyamāṇānām aurabhrikādibhir urabhrādīnāṃ (Vvs_)	So how can the dying of sheep who have been attacked by shepherds, take place?
maraṇaṃ bhavti / atatkṛte vā tanmaraṇe katham aurabhrikādīnāṃ prāṇātipātāvadyena yogo bhavati /	If their dying takes place without the shepherds having done anything, how can the shepherds be held responsible for the offense of taking life ?

tathā paravijñaptiviśeṣādhipatyāt pareṣāṃ jīvitendriyavirodhinī kācid vikriyotpadyate yayā sabhāgasaṃtativicchedākhyaṃ maraṇaṃ bhavatīti veditavyaṃ	In the same way, through the force of a special perception of another, a certain modification of the aggregate-series, destroying its life-force, may arise, through which dying, which is to be known as a name for a discontinuity in the aggregate-series taking part in an organism, takes place.
kathaṃ vā daṇḍakāraṇyaśūnyatvam ṛṣikopataḥ /	Or else, how was it that the Dandaka Forest became empty because of the anger of seers ?
yadi paravijñaptiviśeṣādhipatyāt sattvānāṃ maraṇaṃ neṣyate / manodaṇḍasya hi mahāsāvadyatvaṃ sādhayatā bhagavatopālir gṛhapatiḥ pṛṣṭaḥ / kaccit te gṛhapate śrutaṃ kena tāni daṇḍakāraṇyāni mātaṅgāraṇyāni kaliṅgāraṇyāni śūnyāni medhyībhūtāni /	a If it isn't accepted that the dying of beings can occur through the force of a special perception in others, how is it that the Exalted One, in order to demonstrate that mental harm constitutes a great offense, questioned Upali when he was still a householder, as follows: "Householder! Through what agency were the Daṇḍaka, Matanga, and Kalinga Forests made empty and sacred, as has been reported ?”, and Upāli replied, “I heard that it happened through the mental harming of seers, Gautama."
manodaṇḍo mahāvadyaḥ kathaṃ vā tena sidhyati //	If not, how could it be demonstrated that mental harm constitutes a great offense ?
yady evaṃ kalpyate / tadabhiprasannair amānuṣais tadvāsinaḥ sattvā utsāditā na tv ṛṣīṇāṃ manaḥpradoṣān mṛtā ity evaṃ sati kathaṃ tena karmaṇā manodaṇḍaḥ kāyavāgdaṇḍābhyāṃ mahāvadyatamaḥ siddho bhavati / tanmanaḥpradoṣamātreṇa tāvatāṃ sattvānāṃ maraṇāt sidhyati //	If this situation were constructed as not taking place through a mental harming, and it were to be said that those sentient beings that were living in that forest were destroyed by nonhuman spirits that had been propitiated as if they were seers, how could it be demonstrated by this passage that mental harm through mental action is a greater offense than bodily or verbal harm ? This passage demonstrates that the dying of so many sentient beings came about only through a mental harming.
yadi vijñaptimātram evedaṃ paracittavidaḥ kiṃ paracittaṃ jānanty atha na /	Objection: But if all this is perception-only, do those who understand the cittas of others really know the cittas of others, or don't they?
kiṃ cātaḥ /	Reply : What about this ?
yadi na jānanti kathaṃ paracittavido bhavanti /	Objector: If they don't know them, how can they be "those who understand the cittas of others" ?
atha jānanti /	Reply They know them.
paracittavidāṃ jñānam ayathārthaṃ kathaṃ yathā /	The knowledge of those who understand others' cittas is not like an object. And how is this?
svacittajñānaṃ	As in the case of a knowledge of one's own citta.
tad api katham ayathārtha /	a Objector : And how is that knowledge (of one's own citta) not like an object ?
ajñānād yathā buddhasya gocaraḥ //	Reply : Because of non-knowledge, as in the case of the scope of Buddhas.
yathā tannirabhilāpyenātmanā buddhānāṃ gocaraḥ /	b It's just like in the case of the scope of Buddhas, which comes about through the ineffable Self.
tathā tadajñānāt tadubhayaṃ na yathārthaṃ vitathapratibhāsatayā grāhyagrāhakavikalpasyāprahīṇatvāt //	Thus both of these knowledges, because of their inherent non-knowledge, are not like an object, because it is through the state of an appearance of something which appears differently than it does later that there is a state of non-abandonment of the discrimination between object apprehended and subject apprehendor.
anantaviniścayaprabhedāgāmbhīryāyāṃ vijñaptimātratāyāṃ / vijñaptimātratāsiddhiḥ svaśaktisadṛśī mayā / kṛteyaṃ sarvathā sā tu na cintyā	Though perception-only has unfathomable depth, and there are limitless kinds of ascertainments to be gained in it, I have written this demonstration of perception-only according to my abilities,The Twenty Verses and Their Commentary but in its entirety it is beyond the scope of citta.
sarvaprakārā tu sā mādṛśaiś cintayituṃ na śakyate / tarkāviṣayatvāt /	a It is impossible for people like me to consider it in all its aspects, because it is not in the range of dialetics.
buddhagocaraḥ // buddhānāṃ hi sā bhagavatāṃ sarvaprakāraṃ gocaraḥ sarvākārasarvajñeyajñānāvighātād iti // viṃśatikā vijñaptimātratāsiddhiḥ /	And in order to show by whom it is known entirely as a scope of insight, it is said to be the scope of Buddhas. b In all its modes, it is the scope of Buddhas, Exalted Ones, because of their lack of impediment to the knowledge of everything that can be known in all aspects.
