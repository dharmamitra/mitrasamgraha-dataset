Though the Bodhisattva experienced an extreme delight at his heart's desire being realised, a doubt arose within him as to whether the Brāhman had really said so or, this thought being always present to his mind himself had fancied so, and since he longed to hear the very sweet words of the eye being asked, he thus spoke to the eye-asker:.
kenānuśiṣṭastvamihābhyupeto māṃ yācituṃ brāhmaṇamukhya cakṣuḥ / sudustyajaṃ cakṣuriti pravādaḥ saṃbhāvanā kasya mayi vyatītā //	Who has instructed thee, illustrious Brāhman, to come here and to ask from me one eye? No one, it is said, will easily part with his eye.
atha sa brāhmaṇaveṣadhārī śakro devendrastasya rājña āśayaṃ viditvovāca-	Who is he that thinks the contrary of me? Śakra, the Lord of the Devas in the disguise of a Brahman, knowing the intention of the king, answered:.
śakrasya śakrapratimānuśiṣṭyā tvāṃ yācituṃ cakṣurihāgato 'smi /	It is Sakra. His statue, instructing me to ask thee for thy eye, has caused me to come here.
atha sa rājā śakrasaṃkīrtanānnūnamasya brāhmaṇasya bhavitrī devatānubhāvādanena vidhinā cakṣuḥsaṃpaditi matvā pramodaviśadākṣaramenamuvāca-	Now make real his opinion and my hope by giving me thy eye. Hearing the name of Śakra, the king thought: Surely, through divine power this Brāhman shall regain his eyesight in this way, and he spoke in a voice, the clear sound of which manifested his joy:.
yenābhyupeto 'si manorathena tameṣa te brāhmaṇa pūrayāmi /	Brāhman, will fulfil thy wish, which has prompted thee to come here.
ākāṅkṣamāṇāya madekamakṣi dadāmi cakṣurdvayamapyahaṃ te //	Thou desirest one eye from me, shall give thee both..

The king's counsellors, understanding that he had decided to part with his eyes, were perplexed and agitated, and sadness afflicted their minds. They said to the king:,.
dānātiharṣādanayamasamīkṣyāhitodayam /	Majesty, Your too great fondness for charity makes you overlook that this is mismanagement leading to evil.
prasīda deva mā maivaṃ na cakṣurdātumarhasi // ekasyārthe dvijasyāsya mā naḥ sarvān parākṛthāḥ /	Be propitious, then, desist from your purpose; do not give up your eyesight! For the sake of one twice-born man you must not disregard all of us.
alaṃ śokāgninā dagdhuṃ sukhaṃ saṃvardhitāḥ prajāḥ //	Do not burn with the fire of sorrow your subjects, to whom you have hitherto ensured comfort and prosperity.

gṛhāṇi sarvartusukhāni dehi mā dāḥ svacakṣurjagadekacakṣuḥ //	Give those, and not your eyesight. you who are the only eye of the world.
vimṛśyatāmapi ca tāvanmahārāja /	Moreover, great king, you must but consider this: Not only the houses, therefore, are meant, but also the (female) attendance; in other words, the epithet is indicative of the richness and magnificence of the habitations..
anyadīyaṃ kathaṃ nāma cakṣuranyatra yojyate / atha devaprabhāvo 'yaṃ tvaccakṣuḥ kimapekṣyate //	How can the eye of one person be put in the face of another? If, however, divine power may effect this, why should your eye be wanted for it? Further, Your Majesty.

That he might witness the abundance of others? Well then, give him money; do not commit an act of rashness! Then the king addressed his ministers in soft and conciliating terms.
adāne kurute buddhiṃ dāsyāmītyabhidhāya yaḥ / sa lobhapāśaṃ prabhraṣṭamātmani pratimuñcati //	He who after promising to give, makes up his mind to withhold his gift, such a one puts on again the bond of cupidity which he had cast off before.
dāsyāmīti pratijñāya yo 'nyathā kurute manaḥ / kārpaṇyāniścitamateḥ kaḥ syātpāpatarastataḥ //	He who after promising to give, does not keep his promise, being driven from his resolution by avarice, should he not be held for the worst of men?.
sthirīkṛtyārthināmāśāṃ dāsyāmīti pratijñayā / visaṃvādanarūkṣasya vacaso nāsti niṣkṛtiḥ //	He who having strengthened the hope of the mendicants by engaging himself to give, pays them with the harsh disappointment of a refusal, for him there is no expiation.
yadapi ceṣṭaṃ devatānubhāvādeva cakṣurasya kiṃ na saṃbhavatītyatra śrūyatām-	And with respect to your asserting ‘is divine power of itself not sufficient to restore the eyesight to that man? you should be taught this.

After this, the first minister who more than the others had got into the intimate confidence of the king, overlooking, owing to his solicitude, the respect due to the king, spoke thus: Pray, do it not.

With what aim do you wish so? Where on earth has there been seen such a way of proceeding?.
labdhāvakāśastridaśeṣu yajñaiḥ kīrtyā samantādavabhāsamānaḥ / narendracūḍādyutirañjitāṅghriḥ kiṃ lipsamāno nu dadāsi cakṣuḥ //	By your sacrifices you have gained a place among the celestial gods, your fame is shining far and wide, your feet reflect the splendour of the head-ornaments of the kings (your vassals) what then is it that you long for to give up your eyesight?.

When the king beheld the eye-asker in the possession of one unclosed eye, his heart expanded with the utmost delight, and he presented him with the other eye too. The eyes being given away, the king's visage looked like a lotus-pond without lotuses, yet it bore the expression of satisfaction, not shared however by the citizens.
paurairasādhāraṇatuṣṭirāsīt samagracakṣurdadṛśe dvijaśca //	On the other hand, the Brāhman was seen with sound eyes.
antaḥpure 'tha manujādhipateḥ pure ca śokāśrubhirvasumatī siṣice samantāt /	In the inner apartments of the palace as well as in the town, everywhere tears of sorrow moistened the ground.
śakrastu vismayamavāpa parāṃ ca tuṣṭiṃ saṃbodhaye nṛpamakampyamatiṃ samīkṣya // atha śakrasya vismayāvarjitahṛdayasyaitadabhavat-	But Śakra was transported with admiration and satisfaction, seeing the king's unshaken intention of attaining Supreme Wisdom (Sambodhi). And in this state of mind he entered into this reflection.
aho dhṛtiraho sattvamaho sattvahitaiṣitā / pratyakṣamapi karmedaṃ karotīva vicāraṇām //	What a constancy! What a goodness and a longing for the good of the creatures! Though witnessed the fact, can scarcely believe it.
tannāyamāścaryasattvaściramimaṃ parikleśamanubhavitumarhati /	It is not right, then, that this person of marvellous goodness should endure this great hardship for a long time.

Afterwards, when time had healed the wounds caused by the operation, and lessened and almost lulled the sorrow of the inhabitants of the palace, the town, and the country, it happened one day that the king, desirous of solitary retirement, was sitting with crossed legs in his garden on the border of a pond of lotuses. That spot was beset by fair and fine trees bent down by the weight of their flowers; swarms of bees were humming; a gentle, fresh, and odoriferous wind was blowing agreeably.
śakro 'hamasmi devendrastvatsamīpamupāgataḥ / rājovāca-svāgatam /	Suddenly Sakra, the Lord of the Devas, presented himself before the king.
ājñāpyatāṃ kenārtha iti /	Being asked who he was, he answered: a.
sa upacārapuraḥsaramukto rājānaṃ punaruvāca-	After being thus complimented, he again addressed the king: b.

Now the king being ever wont to give, and having never trodden the way of miserable begging, in conformity with his astonishment and his lofty mind spoke to him:,.
prabhūtaṃ me dhanaṃ śakra śaktimacca mahadbalam / andhabhāvāttvidānīṃ me mṛtyurevābhirocate //	Great is my wealth, Śakra, my army is large and strong; my blindness, however, makes death welcome to me.
api ca pṛcchāmi tāvadbhavantam /	But this thou must tell me:.
imāmavasthāṃ gamitasya yācakaiḥ kathaṃ nu te saṃprati teṣu mānasam / pracakṣva tattāvadalaṃ nigūhituṃ vrajeśca saṃpratyapanīya tāṃ yathā // rājovāca- ko 'yamasmān vikatthayitumatrabhavato nirbandhaḥ? api ca devendra śrūyatām-	It is the mendicants who have caused thee to come in this state; how is it that thy mind is occupied with them even now? Say on! do not hide the truth from me and thou mayst take the way to immediate cure. The king replied: Why dost thou insist upon my boasting myself? Hear, however, Lord of the Devas.

No sooner had the king pronounced these words than by the power of his firm veracity and his excellent store of meritorious actions one eye appeared to him, resembling a piece of a lotus-petal, encompassing a pupil like sapphire.
prādurbhūte ca tasminnayanāścarye pramuditamanāḥ sa rājā punarapi śakramuvāca-	Rejoiced at this miraculous appearance of his eye, the king again spoke to Śakra:.
yaścāpi māṃ cakṣurayācataikaṃ tasmai mudā dve nayane pradāya / prītyutsavaikāgramatiryathāsaṃ dvitīyamapyakṣi tathā mamāstu //	And as surely as, after giving away both eyes to him who asked but one, my mind knew no other feeling but the utmost delight, so surely may obtain also the other eye!.
udīritā harṣaparītamānasairmahārddhibhirbhūtagaṇaiḥ savismayaiḥ /	From all parts were heard voices of praise, uttered by crowds of beings endowed with great magic power.

In the Pāli Jātaka, Sakka incites the king to it in plain terms. Other instances of the saccakiriyā, as it is styled in the Pāļi, will occur in Stories,,.
amogharūpā bata puṇyasaṃcayāścirasya dharmeṇa khalūrjitaṃ jitam //	It was spring when the miracle happened, as is to be inferred from the flowers being mentioned above..
na no na vidito rājaṃstava śuddhāśayāśayaḥ / evaṃ nu pratidatte te mayeme nayane nṛpa //	Thy true feeling was not hidden from me, pure-hearted king; so have but rendered thee these eyes of thine.

Having said these words, Sakra disappeared on the spot.

That town exhibited a festival attire, being adorned with hoisted flags and manifold banners, the citizens looking on and the Brāhmans praising the monarch with hails and benedictions. When he had seated himself in his audience- hall, in the midst of a great crowd, made up of the ministers in the The sudden appearance of these officials and ministers is somewhat strange here.

In the circumference of one hundred of yojanas see everything, though hidden by many mountains, as distinctly as if it were near.

The purport of this royal precept maybe illustrated by the corresponding parts of the narrative in the Pāli Jātaka. The precept is there given twice, in prose and in verse, see Fausböll's Jātaka, p.

bodhisattvabhūtaḥ kilāyaṃ bhagavān kośalādhipatirbabhūva /	In the time, when our Lord was still a Bodhisattva, he was a king of Kośala.
tasyotsāhamantraprabhuśaktisaṃpatprabhṛtīnāṃ prakarṣiṇāmapi rājaguṇānāṃ vibhūtimatiśiśye daivasaṃpadguṇaśobhā / guṇāstasyādhikaṃ rejurdaivasaṃpadvibhūṣaṇāḥ / kiraṇā iva candrasya śaradunmīlitaśriyaḥ //	Though he displayed his royal virtues, such as energy, discretion, majesty, power, and the rest in an exceedingly high degree, the brilliancy of one virtue, his great felicity, surpassed the others. His virtues, being embellished by his felicity, shone the more as the moonbeams do, when autumn makes their splendour expand.
tatyāja dṛptānapi tasya śatrūn rakteva reme tadapāśriteṣu / ityāsa tasyānyanarādhipeṣu kopaprasādānuvidhāyinī śrīḥ //	Fortune, who dwelt with him, distributed her wrath and favour to the other kings in such a manner, that she abandoned his enemies, however proud, but like an amorous woman cherished his vassals.
dharmātmakatvānna ca nāma tasya paropatāpāśivamāsa cetaḥ /	His righteousness, however, prevented his mind from doing ill; so he did not oppress at all his adversaries.

so 'nantarātītāṃ svajātimanusasmāra /	Now one day this king recollected his last previous existence.

Moreover, as he was desirous of bringing his people into the way of salvation by magnifying the power of meritorious actions, he was in the habit of uttering with a believing heart in his audience-hall as well as in the inner apartments of his palace these two stanzas, full of import:.
na sugataparicaryā vidyate svalpikāpi pratanuphalavibhūtiryacchrutaṃ kevalaṃ prāk /	Attending on Buddhas by paying them honour, howsoever little, cannot produce a trifling fruit.
tadidamalavaṇāyāḥ śuṣkarūkṣāruṇāyāḥ phalavibhavamahattvaṃ paśya kulmāṣapiṇḍyāḥ //	This has been taught before only by words, now it may be seen. Look at the rich affluence of the fruit, produced by a small portion of saltless, dry, coarse, reddish-brown gruel.
phalasamudayaśobhāṃ paśya kulmāṣapiṇḍyāḥ //	fuller form upoșadha occurs in the Avadānakalpalatā,.

atha tasya rājño vāgnityatvādavyāhatatarapraṇayaprasarā devī samutpannakautūhalāsaṃkathāprastāvagataṃ parṣadi paryapṛcchadenam-	Now by the king's incessant repeating of them the queen also grew curious; and as she felt less embarrassment in putting forth her request, one day, the opportunity of entering into conversation upon this subject presenting itself, she put this question in full audience to him;,.
niyatamiti narendra bhāṣase hṛdayagatāṃ mudamudgiranniva /	Verily, at all times, my lord, you are reciting, as if you were giving vent to the gladness which is within your heart.

Then the king cast a mild look of gladness on his queen, and with a smile-blooming face he spoke:,.
avibhāvya nimittārthaṃ śrutvodgāramimaṃ mama / na kevalaṃ tavaivātra kautūhalacalaṃ manaḥ // samantamapyetadamātyamaṇḍalaṃ kutūhalāghūrṇitalolamānasam /	When hearing this utterance of mine without perceiving its cause, it is not only you, that are excited by curiosity, but also the whole of my officials, my town, and my zenana are troubled and disturbed by the desire of knowing the meaning of it.
puraṃ ca sāntaḥpuramatra tena me niśamyatāṃ yena mayaivamucyate //	Listen, then, to what am going to say..
suptaprabuddha iva jātimanumarāmi yasyāmihaiva nagare bhṛtako 'hamāsam /	Just as one who awakes from sleep, remember my existence, when lived a servant in this very town.
śīlānvito 'pi dhanamātrasamucchritebhyaḥ karmābhirādhanasamarjitadīnavṛttiḥ //	Although was keeping good conduct, earned a sorry livelihood by performing hired labour for people elevated only because of their wealth.

tebhyaḥ prasādamṛdunā manasā praṇamya kulmāṣamātrakamadāṃ prayataḥ svagehe /	After bowing to them with a mind softened by faith, reverentially entertained them in my house with a small dish of gruel.
tasyāṅkurodaya ivaiṣa yadanyarāja- cūḍāprabhāścaraṇareṇuṣu me niṣaktāḥ /\	Out of that sprout has sprung this tree of greatness, that the glitterings of the crest-jewels of other kings are now reflected in the dust on my feet.

Then the queen's face expanded with gladness and surprise. She raised her eyes respectfully to the king, saying: Highly probable, indeed, is it that such very great prosperity is the fruit produced by meritorious actions, since you, great king, being yourself a witness of the result of meritorious actions, are so anxious for (gathering) merit.
tadevameva pāpapravṛttivimukhaḥ piteva prajānāṃ samyakparipālanasumukhaḥ puṇyagaṇārjanābhimukhaḥ	For this very reason you are disinclined to evil actions, disposed to protect your subjects duly like a father, and intent on earning plenty of merit..

Shining with illustrious glory enhanced by charity, vanquisher of your rival kings waiting with bent heads for your orders, may you for a long time with a righteous management rule the earth up to its wind-wrinkled ocean-border!

No, that man is not even worth looking at, who inwrapt in the darkness of avarice, should decline to make himself renowned for his gifts, though being wealthy enough to do so.

His fairness and integrity in commercial transactions procured him the highest esteem among the people; he was born of an illustrious family; he had acquainted himself with various branches of learning and art, and by them purified his mind.

In order to put an obstacle in his way, he created by magic between the Reverend and the threshold of the entrance-door a very deep hell measuring several fathoms in width.

The Bodhisattva, however, knew him: Surely, this is an attempt of the Evil One to thwart my alms-giving. And understanding so, he made, in truth, a vigorous reply, yet in accordance with his firm attachment The idea which underlies this assertion is often met with in Brāhmanical literature.

When Sakra, the Lord of the Devas, heard of his lofty munificence, he was transported with amazement: and wishing to try the firmness of his resolution, he caused the everyday provisions of money, grains, jewels, clothes to disappear day after day; perhaps, so he thought, his apprehension at least of the loss of his goods may entice him to self interest. Nevertheless, the Great Being remained intent on the virtue of charity..

The moon, then being at a great distance from the sun, showed its orb almost full and resembling by its bright beauty a silver mirror without handle. When the Bodhisattva beheld it showing its disc not fully rounded on one side, and considered that it was the moon of the fourteenth of the bright half that had risen, he said to his comrades:.

When his reflection had come to that point, the Great minded One recovered his keenness of thought.

Now Sakra, the Lord of the Devas, understanding his intention, created by magic a heap of charcoal burning without smoke; this mass had the colour of purified gold, very thin flames shot forth out of it, and a multitude of sparks were scattered about.

His birth enhanced the lustre of this family in the same way as the moon rising in autumn with full and spotless orb, beautifies the firmament.

So casting away, as if it were a straw, that great abundance of wealth which he had obtained without trouble, and which must have possessed charms for him because of the high regard which he enjoyed among the people, he gave himself up to the observance of the discipline and the self-restraint of world-renouncing ascetics.

That island is. Its outskirts are moistened by the play of the wanton waves, which moved by the wind have the blue colour of pieces of sapphire; white sand covers its ground; various trees, the branches of which are adorned with twigs, flowers and fruits, enhance its beauty; near its shore there is a lake of pure water.

Yet Śakra, the Lord of the Devas, though his astonishment increased, in consequence of the Bodhisattva's behaviour in that situation, and his high opinion of his virtues grew stronger, resorted to another trial.

Then Sakra, the Lord of the Devas, understanding that it was not his own celestial splendour that was claimed by the Bodhisattva, was set at rest, and as he was very pleased with that well-said sentence, he honoured it by exclaiming Very well! and requested him to accept some boon.

On hearing this, Śakra praised him, exclaiming Very well! very well! and charmed by his right sayings, spoke again:.

Then the Bodhisattva, in order to show that the virtuous are welcome in every circumstance, spoke:.

Say, Kāśyapa, what is the reason that thou showest this rather foolish greediness for the sight of a wise man? Then the Bodhisattva, in order to show him the magnanimity of the virtuous, spoke: Hearken, sir, for what reason my mind longs for the sight of a wise man,,, He walks in the path of virtue himself, and brings also others into that way, and words said for his good, even if they be harsh, do not rouse his impatience.
aśaṭhavinayabhūṣaṇaḥ sadā hitamiti lambhayituṃ sa śakyate /	Being adorned by uprightness and decency, it is always possible to make him accept what is said for his good.

Then Sakra praised him, exclaiming: Well said! very excellent! and with still increased satisfaction again summoned him to ask some boon.
kāmaṃ saṃtoṣasātmatvātsarvatra kṛtameva te / madanugrahabuddhyā tu grahītuṃ varamarhasi //	Surely, thou hast already obtained everything, since thou art wholly satisfied, yet thou shouldst take some boon from me, considering it as a means of gratifying me.

Then the Bodhisattva, seeing his utmost desire for doing good, and wishing to please him and to benefit him, answered so as to declare to him the superiority of the strong desire of almsgiving..
tvadīyamannaṃ kṣayadoṣavarjitaṃ manaścsa ditsāpratipattipeśalam / viśuddhaśīlābharaṇāśca yācakā mama syuretāṃ varasaṃpadaṃ vṛṇe // śakra uvāca-subhāṣitaratnākaraḥ khalvatrabhavān /	May thy food, which is free from destruction and corruption, thy mind, which is lovely because of its practice of charity, and mendicants adorned by the pureness of their good conduct, be mine! This most blessed boon ask. Śakra said: Thy Reverence is a mine of jewels of well-said sentences.

varaṃ mamānugrahasaṃpadākaraṃ dadāsi cetsarvadivaukasāṃ vara / na mābhyupeyāḥ punarityabhijjvalannimaṃ varaṃ dainyanisūdanaṃ vṛṇe //	If thou wilt give me a boon which incloses the highest favour for me, most excellent of all Celestials do not come to me again in this thy blazing splendour.
atha śakraḥ sāmarṣavadenamativismayamāna uvāca-mā tāvadbhoḥ /	For this boon ask the destroyer of the Daityas. Upon this Śakra was somewhat irritated, and highly astonished he thus spoke to him: Do not speak so, sir.
japavratejyāsvidhinā tapaḥśramairjano 'yamanvicchati darśanaṃ mama /	By every kind of ritual: prayers, vows, sacrifices, with penances and toilsome exertions, people on earth seek to obtain the sight of me.

na hyasāvadākṣiṇyānuvṛttirna cāpyabahumānaviceṣṭitamasamavadhānakāmyatā vā bhavati bhavatām /	It is not for want of courtesy that ask so, nor is it a deed of irreverence, nor do aim at showing lack of devotion towards Thy Majesty.

Then Śakra bowed to him, circumambulated him from left to right, and disappeared on the spot.

tenānnapānavidhinā sa munirmaharṣīn saṃtarpayan mudamudāratarāmavāpa / vṛttyā ca tāpasajanocitayābhireme dhyānāpramāṇaniyamena śamena caiva //	Supplying in this way with food and drink the wants of those most holy sages, the Muni obtained a sublime joy; and he delighted in living after the manner suitable for ascetics, in performing his boundless vow of meditation (dhyāna), and in tranquillity.

[So considering, a virtuous man must adorn himself with heroic constancy of giving. This (story) must also be adduced, when treating of the gladness caused to a liberal and charitable man; when blaming covetousness, hatred, infatuation, and foolishness; when preaching on the Virtue of the intercourse with a pious friend, or on contentment.
evaṃ pūrvajanmasvapi subhāṣitaratnātiśayākaraḥ sa bhagavān prāgeva saṃbuddha iti //	Likewise in discourses on the magnanimity of the Tathāgata; So our Lord was an inexhaustible mine of jewels of excellent sayings,.

Now one day, five Yakṣas, whom for some offence or other (Kubera) the Lord of the Yakṣas had exiled from his dominions, came to his realm. These goblins were Ojohāras skilled in the art of killing others.

And they assumed the shape of men of the Brāhman class, and going about, they saw a certain cowherd of those who live in the forest region, who was sitting upon a grass-plot at the foot of a shady tree. He had shoes on his feet, and on his head he wore a garland, made of flowers and opening buds of forest-trees. His stick and his hatchet he had laid on the earth on his right.

Him they approached and imitating human voice, they said to him: Well, friend, thou who art charged with guarding the cows, how is it that staying thus alone in this lonely forest where no man is to be seen, thou are not afraid? And he, looking at them, spoke: Of what should be afraid? The Yakṣas said: Hast thou never before heard that such goblins as Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, or Piśācas are cruel by nature?,.

How, then, is it In the original the Yakṣas utter some inarticulate sounds before succeeding in speaking Sanskrit.

Upon this the Yakṣas became very curious, and said to him respectfully, as if to encourage him: Why, you must tell us, gentle sir, you must tell us, of what kind this extraordinary svastyayana of yours is. He answered them, laughing once more: Hear, then, of what kind this very wonderful excellent svastyayana of ours is.

How has this happened? Or have you perhaps heard of it, but distrusting the excessive marvel of that fame, not minded it?.

The Yakṣas said: Gentle sir, tell us, of what nature is this power of that king, that spirits are by no means able to hurt the inhabitants of his realm? The cowherd replied: Our monarch has obtained this power through his high-mindedness.

The Yakşas, being already moved with anger against the king on account of his obstructing the manifestation of their power, were in no way softened by this affectionate and well-deserved eulogy of his virtues.
prāyeṇa khalu mandānāmamarṣajvalitaṃ manaḥ / yasmin vastuni tatkīrtyā tadviśeṣeṇa dahyate //	Verily, as a rule the mind of fools becomes inflamed the more by the praise of the object which has excited their fervent wrath.

Still there may be a slight difference. The king rejoiced, ordered his officers who stood in charge of such matters: Go and quickly present the Brāhmans with a delicious meal. The Yakṣas, however, were not ready to accept the meal served to them, though it might have suited the royal table, but spurning it, as tigers would green grass, said they did not feed on such dishes.

These Yaksas, on the other hand, who live on food of that kind, with hearts wicked and pitiless, are destroying their own happiness every day. When will their sufferings ever end? This being so, how is it possible for me to procure such food for them? Not even for one single day could injure others and destroy life.

For the flesh of animals who have died a natural death is cold and bloodless, and of course does not please them; and their hunger is great and attested by their afflicted figures. On the one hand, how may take flesh out of the body of any other living being? On the other, how may suffer them who have resorted to me, to draw off in this manner, with countenances languishing and eyes sunken in consequence of their hunger and thirst, and still more sick with grief because of the fruitlessness of their request on which they had founded their hopes? It is, therefore, the right time to act in this way..

Having so resolved, the Great-minded One, whose eyes and face received increase of splendour by the outburst of his gladness spoke thus to the Yakṣas, pointing out his body to them:.

na hi tāṃ kurute prītiṃ vibhūtirbhavanāśritā / saṃkramyamāṇārthijane saiva dānapriyasya yām /\	No opulence, in truth, within doors procures to a charitable man such rejoicing, as it produces when transferred to the mendicants.

Accordingly one day, when Viśvantara was inspecting his alms-halls, manifesting his gladness of mind by the enhanced beauty of his countenance, the said Brāhmans placed themselves in his way, uttering benedictions with their uplifted and outstretched right hands.
sa tato vinigṛhya dviradavaramupacārapuraḥsaramabhigamanaprayojanamenān paryapṛcchat-āj~āpyatāṃ kenārtha iti /	He stopped his excellent elephant, and asked them respectfully the reason of their coming; they had but to express their want, he said.
brāhmaṇā ūcuḥ-	The Brāhmans spoke:,.
amuṣya tava nāgasya gatilīlāvilambinaḥ / guṇairarthitvamāyātā dānaśauryācca te vayam /\	Both the excellent qualities of this elephant of thine, who has so graceful a gait, and thy heroic love of charity make us like beggars.

The Bodhisattva being thus addressed, was filled with sincere joy and entered upon this reflection.
kaḥ punarartha evaṃvidhena dviradapatinaiṣāṃ brāhmaṇānām? vyaktamayaṃ lobherṣyādveṣaparyakulamanasaḥ kasyāpi rājñaḥ kārpaṇyaprayogaḥ /	But, after all, what may be the want of such a lord of elephants to these Brāhmans? No doubt, this must be a miserable trick of some king, whose mind is troubled with covetousness, jealousy, and hatred.

Having thus considered, the Great-minded One alighted from the back of the excellent elephant and stood before them with uplifted golden pitcher; then he pronounced (the solemn formula) Accept..
tataḥ sa vidvānapi rājaśāstramarthānuvṛttyā gatadharmamārgam / dharmānurāgeṇa dadau gajendraṃ nītivyalīkena na saṃcakampe //	After which, though knowing that the science of politics follows the path of Righteousness (dharma) only as far as it may agree with material interest (artha), he gave away his foremost elephant. His attachment to Righteousness did not allow him to be frightened by the lie of political wisdom.
taṃ hemajālarucirābharaṇaṃ gajendraṃ vidyutpinaddhamiva śāradamabhrarāśim / dattvā parāṃ mudamavāpa narendrasūnuḥ saṃcukṣubhe ca nagaraṃ nayapakṣapātāt //	Having given away that lord of elephants, who, adorned with the lovely golden lattice-seat on his back, resembled a massy cloud of autumn, radiant with a flash of lightening, the royal prince obtained the utmost delight but the citizens were stricken with consternation, for they were adherents of political wisdom.

In the Pāli redaction which is the source of Spence Hardy's narration of our tale, it is said that this white elephant had the power of causing rain.. Owing to their agitation, resentment, and anger, they neglected the restraint imposed on them by the respect due to their monarch, and spoke: Why do you overlook in this manner, Your Majesty, the fortune of your kingdom being carried off? Your Majesty ought not to overlook that in this way you are fostering the misfortune of your realm. When the king, alarmed, asked them what they meant by this, they replied: Why, are you not aware of what has happened, Your Majesty?,.

Nevertheless, shall take such measures that Viśvantara will know a limit in his almsgiving.

śibaya ūcuḥ- na khalu mahārāja paribhāṣāmātrasādhyo 'sminnarthe viśvaṃtara iti / saṃjaya uvāca- atha kimanyadatra mayā śakyaṃ kartum?	The Sibis answered: No, Your Majesty, this will not do. Viśvantara is no person to be brought to reason in this matter by a simple censure. Samjaya spoke: But what else can do?.
doṣapravṛttervimukhasya yasya guṇaprasaṅgā vyasanīkriyante /	He is averse to sinful actions, only his attachment to virtuous practices is turning into a kind of passion.

Therefore, desist from your wrath! Henceforward will prevent Visvantara from such actions. Notwithstanding this, the Sibis persisted in their anger and said:,.
ko vā vadhaṃ bandhanatāḍanaṃ vā sutasya te rocayate narendra /	Who would be pleased, king, with the pain of death, or prison, or flogging pronounced upon your son? But being devoted to his religious duties, Viśvantara is not fit to be a.

phalanti kāmaṃ vasudhādhipānāṃ durnītidoṣāstadupāśriteṣu /	Surely, if princes commit faults of bad policy, the results of those faults fall on their subjects.
sahyāsta eṣāṃ tu tathāpi dṛṣṭā mūloparodhānna tu pārthivānām //	They are however bearable for them, after all, as is taught by experience; not so for the kings themselves, the very roots of whose power they undermine.
kimatra vā bahvabhidhāya niścayastvayaṃ śibīnāṃ tvadabhūtyamarṣiṇām /	Why, then, here say much? Not capable of conniving at a state of things which must lead to your ruin, the Śibis have taken this resolution.
prayātu vaṅkaṃ tapaso 'bhivṛddhaye nṛpātmajaḥ siddhaniṣevitaṃ girim //	The royal prince must withdraw to Mount Vanka, the residence of the Siddhas; there he may exert his penance.
prabhātāyāṃ rajanyāmabhipretaṃ vo 'nuṣṭhātā viśvaṃtara iti /	Tomorrow at day-break Viśvantara shall accomplish your desire. This answer satisfied the Sibis.

The chamberlain said he would do so, and, his face bathed in tears, went to Viśvantara, who was at that moment in his own palace. Overwhelmed by his sorrow, he threw himself at the feet of the prince, weeping aloud.

But why are you thus excited, then? Viśvantara replied. Being so asked once more, the chamberlain whose throat was choked with tears, uttered slowly and in a faltering tone these words, interrupting and disturbing them by his sobs:.
sāntvagarbhāmanādṛtya nṛpājñāmapyadakṣiṇāḥ / rāṣṭrātpravrājayanti tvāṃ kupitāḥ śibayo nṛpa // viśvaṃtara uvāca-māṃ śibayaḥ pravājayanti kupitā iti kaḥ saṃbandhaḥ?	Brusquely disregarding the royal command, though it was declared to them in gentle terms, the Śibis, moved by anger, order you to be banished from the kingdom, my prince. Visvantara said: Me... the Śibis. order to be banished, moved by anger! What you say is out of all reason.
rame na vinayonmārge dveṣmi cāhaṃ pramāditām /	Never did take delight in leaving the path of discipline, and detest carelessness about my duties.
kutra me śibayaḥ kruddhā yanna paśyāmi duṣkṛtam // kṣattovāca-atyudāratāyām /	What evil action of mine, unknown to me, makes the Śibis angry with me? The chamberlain said: They are offended at your exceeding loftiness of mind.
alobhaśubhrā tvayi tuṣṭirāsīllobhākulā yācakamānaseṣu /	Your satisfaction was pure by the disinterested feeling you experienced, but that of those mendicants was troubled by cupidity.
datte tvayā mānada vāraṇendre dhairyāṇi kopastvaharacchibīnām // ityatītāḥ svamaryādāṃ rabhasāḥ śibayastvayi /	When you gave away that foremost of elephants, most noble prince, wrath put the Śibis out of patience and caused them to transgress the limits of their duty. They are furious against you.

At this moment the Bodhisattva displayed both his deeply-rooted affection for the mendicants which his continuous practice of compassion had firmly established, and his grand, immense patience. He said: The nature of the Sibis is fickle, and they cannot understand mine, it seems.
dravyeṣu bāhyeṣu ka eva vādo dadyāmahaṃ sve nayane śiro vā / imaṃ hi lokārthamahaṃ bibharmi samucchrayaṃ kimvatha vastravāhyam //	The objects of sense being outside of ourselves, it is superfluous to say that would give away my eyes or my head. For the benefit of the creatures support this body, how much more the possession of clothes and vehicles.

After this, the Bodhisattva said to his wife, who had turned pale while hearing the sad news: Your Highness has heard the resolution of the Śibis. Madrī replied: have. Viśvantara said:.
nidhehi tadanindyākṣi yacca te paitṛkaṃ dhanam // madryuvāca- kutraitaddeva nidadhāmīti? viśvaṃtara uvāca-	Now make a deposit, fair-eyed one, of all your property, taking what you have got from my part as well as from your father's side. Madrī answered: Where shall lay the deposit, my prince? Viśvantara spoke:,.
śīlavadbhyaḥ sadā dadyā dānaṃ satkāraśībharam /	You must always give in charity to people of good conduct, embellishing your bounty by kind observance.
tathā hi nihitaṃ dravyamahāryamanugāmi ca //	Goods deposited in this manner are imperishable and follow us after death.

Continue in pious conduct, beware of inadvertence; but do not mourn for my absence, will you? It is plain that Śūra supposes the story of Viśvantara to be known to his readers.
naiṣa dharmo mahārāja yadyāyā vanamekakaḥ /	It is not right, Your Majesty, that you should go to the forest alone.
tenāhamapi yāsyāmi yena kṣatriya yāsyasi //	too will go with you where you must go, my lord.

api ca deva /	Indeed, my prince,.

This entreaty of his well-beloved wife filled him with a great desire to set out for the forest.
ityanunīyamānaḥ sa dayitayā vanaprayāṇaparyutsukamatirarthijanāpekṣayā mahāpradānaṃ dātumupacakrame //	Therefore he prepared to bestow great largesses on the mendicant people.

It is now plain she has been deprived of consciousness.
śītāmalasvādujalaṃ nipānaṃ bibhitsatāmasti na ccenniṣeddhā / vyarthābhidhānā bata lokapālā viproṣitā vā śrutimātrakaṃ vā //	If no one will prevent those who are about to destroy that well of cold, pure, and sweet water, then in truth the guardians of the world-quarters are falsely named so, or they are absent, or they are nothing but a mere sound..
adharmo bata jāgarti dharmaḥ supto 'thavā mṛtaḥ / yatra viśvaṃtaro rājā svasmādrājyānnirasyate //	Oh! Indeed Injustice is awake and Righteousness either asleep or dead, since prince Viśvantara is banished from his reign.

The whole of this he distributed according to the merit of the recipients. This being done, he paid his respectful homage to his father and mother, taking leave of them, who were overwhelmed with sadness and grief.

He left the capital, while a great body of people uttered lamentations, the streets being as noisy as on a holiday; nor did he succeed without difficulty in making the crowd turn back, who followed him out of affection, shedding tears of sorrow. Then himself taking the reins, he drove in the direction of Mount Vanka.

He gladly caused his family to alight from the chariot, presented the Brāhman with it, and taking Jālin, his boy, in his arms, he continued his way on foot.

It was encircled as with a girdle by a river of pure, blue water, and the wind was agreeable there, carrying red flower-dust. In this grove stood a desert hut of leaves, lovely to behold, and pleasing in every season. Viśvakarman himself had built it by the orders of Sakra.

While representing to himself that it is not right to repent having given, his heart was burnt by the fire of irremediable grief, and his mind became troubled, as though it were paralysed by torpor occasioned by poison. The fanning of the cool wind made him soon recover his senses, and seeing the hermitage This bird, the cuculus melanoleucus, is a favourite with Indian poets and rhetoricians.

Apprehending evil because of these dreadful sensations of danger, she was agitated and anxious, and looked round about if she might get sight of the children; then she called them. Receiving no answer, she began to lament, being sore with grief.

Madrī, whom the suspicion of the death of her children had put to anguish, now hearing by these words that they were alive, began to recover from her fright and affliction.

It is in order to celebrate your glory, that Heaven has composed the hymn which it thus pronounces in distinct language from afar.

Now the surface of Earth being shaken, Sumeru, the lord of mountains, radiant with the lustre of its manifold gems, began to waver. Śakra, the Lord of the Devas, inquiring into the cause of the earthquake, was informed of it by the regents of the world-quarters, who, with eyes expanding with amazement, told him that it had been caused by Viśvantara giving away his children.

avītarāgeṇa satā putradāramatipriyam / niḥsaṅgamiti dātavyaṃ kā nāmeyamudāttatā //	To cherish an affectionate wife and much-beloved children, and yet to give them up, obeying the self-imposed vow of detachment is it possible to conceive any loftiness like this? This means not so much that the Indian Amor was afflicted on account of the offence against conjugal love, as the defeat of Māra, the Indian Satan.

After so speaking, Sakra reassumed his own brilliant figure and made himself known to the Bodhisattva. Which being done, he said:.

So keeping counsel with the elders among the Brāhmans, headed by his family priest (purohita) and his ministers, he asked them for some means of putting an end to that calamity.
atha te vedavihitamanekaprāṇiśatavadhārambhabhīṣaṇaṃ yajñavidhiṃ suvṛṣṭihetuṃ manyamānāstasmai saṃvarṇayāmāsuḥ /	Now they, believing a solemn sacrifice as is enjoined by the Veda to be a cause of abundant rain, explained to him that he must perform such a sacrifice of a frightful character, inasmuch as it requires the massacre of many hundreds of living beings.

te punarapi taṃ rājānaṃ dharmasaṃkathāprastāvalabdhāvasarā gāmbhīryāvagūḍhaṃ tasya bhāvamajānānā yajñapravṛttaye samanuśaśāsuḥ-	They, on the other hand, no sooner caught the opportunity of conversing with the king on matters of religion, than they once more admonished him to accomplish the sacrifice, for they did not understand his deeply hidden mind.
kāryāṇi rājñāṃ niyatāni yāni lābhe pṛthivyāḥ paripālane ca / nātyeti kālastava tāni nityaṃ teṣāṃ kramo dharmasukhāni yadvat //	You constantly take care not to neglect the proper time of performing your different royal duties, established for the sake of obtaining the possession of land and ruling it. The due order.
trivargasevānipuṇasya tasya prajāhitārthaṃ dhṛtakārmukasya / yajñābhidhāne suralokasetau pramādatandreva kathaṃ matiste //	How then is this that you who (in all other respects) are so clever in the observance of the triad (of dharma, artha, and kāma), bearing your bow to defend the good of your people, are so careless and almost sluggish as to that bridge to the world of the Devas, the name of which is sacrifice?.
bhṛtyairivājñā bahu manyate te sākṣādiyaṃ siddhiriti kṣitīśaiḥ /	Like servants, the kings (your vassals) revere your commands, thinking them to be the surest gauge of success.
śreyāṃsi kīrtijvalitāni cetuṃ yajñairayaṃ te ripukāla kālaḥ // kāmaṃ sadā dīkṣita eva ca tvaṃ dānaprasaṅgānniyamādarācca /	Now the time is come, destroyer of your foes, to gather by means of sacrifice superior blessings, which are to procure for you a shining glory. Certainly, that holiness which is the requisite for a dīkṣita is already yours, by reason of your habitual practice of charity and your strictness in observing the restraint (of good conduct).
vedaprasiddhaiḥ kratubhistathāpi yuktaṃ bhavenmoktumṛṇaṃ surāṇām //	Nevertheless, it would be fit for you to discharge your debt to the Devas by such sacrifices as are the subject-matter of the Veda.

Thereupon he entered upon this thought: Very badly guarded is my poor person indeed, being given in trust to such leaders.
ya eva lokeṣu śaraṇyasaṃmatāsta eva hiṃsāmapi dharmato gatāḥ /	Those who are reputed among men to be the best refuge, are the very persons who intend to do harm, borrowing their arguments from the Law.

viśasyamānaḥ kila mantraśaktibhiḥ paśurdivaṃ gacchati tena tadvadhaḥ /	In this way that action is interpreted to be done according to the Law. Yet it is a lie.
upaiti dharmatvamitīdamapyasat paraiḥ kṛtaṃ ko hi paratra lapsyate // asatpravṛtteranivṛttamānasaḥ śubheṣu karmasvavirūḍhaniścayaḥ /	For how is it possible that in the next world one should reap the fruits of what has been done by others? And by what reason will the sacrificial animal mount to heaven? though he has not abstained from wicked actions, though he has not devoted.
paśurdivaṃ yāsyati kena hetunā hato 'pi yajñe svakṛtāśrayādvinā // hataśca yajñe tridivaṃ yadi vrajennanu vrajeyuḥ paśutāṃ svayaṃ dvijāḥ /	And should the victim killed in sacrifice really go to heaven, should we not expect the Brāhmans to offer themselves to be immolated in sacrifice? similar practice, however, is nowhere seen among them.

These words of the purohita having been approved by the (other) Brāhmans, the king replied: Do not apprehend the wrath of the people, Reverends.
tatha hi saṃvidhāsye yathodvegaṃ me prajā na yāsyantīti / atha sa rājā paurajānapadān saṃnipātyābravīt-icchāmi puruṣamedhasahasreṇa yaṣṭum /	shall take such measures as to prevent any agitation among my subjects. After this the king convoked an assembly of the townsmen and the landsmen, and said: intend to perform a human sacrifice of a thousand victims.

With the object of carrying this resolution into effect, shall cause you to be observed by faultless and sharp-sighted emissaries, who have shaken off sleepy carelessness and will report to me concerning your conduct. Then the foremost of the assembly, folding their hands and bringing them to their foreheads, spoke:,.

Even (god) Brahmā cannot but sanction your behaviour..

After the notables both of the town and the country had accepted his command in this manner, the king dispersed about his towns and all over his country officers, notified as such by their outward appearance to the people, with the charge of laying hold of the evil-doers, and everywhere he ordered proclamations to be made by beat of drum day after day, of this kind:.

Obedience to the words of parents and teachers, a general spirit of liberality and sharing with others, hospitality, good manners, modesty, prevailed among them. In short, they lived as it were in the Kṛta Yuga.

This also contributed to prevent people from falling short of righteousness.

The ministers accepted the royal command and anon went to execute it.

This being done, they caused all who begged in order to satisfy their wants, to be provided day after day with a gift of those objects, just as had been ordered by the king. So poverty disappeared, and the people, having received wealth from the part of the king, dressed and adorned with manifold and fine garments and ornaments, exhibited the splendour of festival days.

And after the whole people, in consequence of the wise measures taken by their ruler, had become intent on virtuous behaviour, the plagues and calamities, overpowered by the growth of all such qualities as conduce to prosperity, faded away, having lost their hold. The seasons succeeded each other in due course, rejoicing everybody by their regularity, and like kings newly established, complying with the lawful order of things.

Accordingly people never wearied of repeating benedictions on their king and extending his renown in all directions One day one of the highest royal officials, whose heart had been inclined to the (True) Belief spoke thus to the king: This is a true saying, in truth.

Your head, adorned with such hair-dress as is in compliance with the rites of the dīkṣā, possesses no less lustre than when it was embellished with the splendour of the royal umbrella.

They marched to his encounter to fight him with an enormous army of elephants, chariots, horsemen and footmen, being the more terrible, as they were drawn up in the proud array of battle and made a noise as awful as that of the wild Ocean. Through the glittering blaze of their various kinds of offensive and defensive weapons they hardly suffered themselves to be looked at.

Mätali answered: In the meanwhile the crowds of the Demons will overtake us, sir. Śakra said: Never mind. Do you but take the proper care in avoiding these eagle-nests. Upon which Mätali answered.

At this moment Śakra, the Lord of the Devas, moved by the utmost compassion, showed his extraordinary goodness of heart and firmness of intention.
tasmānnivartaya rathaṃ varameva mṛtyu-rdaityādhipaprahitabhīmagadābhighātaiḥ /	Well then, said he, turn the chariot.

Mātali promised to do so, and turned his car, drawn by a thousand horses.
dṛṣṭāvadānā ripavastu tasya yuddhe samālokya rathaṃ nivṛttam /	Now the foes who had witnessed his heroism in battle, seeing that the chariot turned, were overtaken with fear, and got into confusion.

So we are powerless, and by this impotency we are smitten with grief. The teacher replied: But there are still other expedients for earning money, and they are explained in the law-books.

The teacher said: No, such means of earning money are hardly available, indeed, for young men, whose mind is too loose to carry out a strong resolution.
yadi tvayamatrabhavatāṃ nirbandhaḥ, tacchrūyatāṃ sādhuḥ katama eko dhanopārjanakramaḥ-	Nevertheless, if Your Honours urge me, well, you may learn from me what one of the said expedients is.
āpaddharmaḥ steyamiṣṭaṃ dvijānāmāpaccāntyā niḥsvatā nāma loke /	In the law-precepts for the time of distress theft is an approved livelihood for Brahmans; and poverty, suppose, is the extreme distress in this world.

sarvaṃ caitadbrahmaṇānāṃ svameva //	The permission to Brāhmans to make money by theft is of course not lawful; it is inferred from the well-known pretension of the Brāhmanical caste to be owners of the whole earth.

na tveṣa yogaḥ śvayaśo hi rakṣyaṃ	You should, however, not practise that mode of taking, minding your reputation.

How is it that your mind is undisturbed and untouched by sorrow? Upon this the Bodhisattva, after making his respectful salute to the teacher, said quite alarmed: Heaven forbid such feelings! Verily, it is not want of affection or hard-heartedness which causes me to keep apart, nor am unmoved by the sufferings of my teacher, but think the mode of acting which my master has shown us, cannot be put into practice.
na hi śakyamadṛśyamānena kvacitpāpamācaritum /	It is impossible, indeed, to commit a wicked action without being seen.

At these words his teacher rapt with joy and admiration, rising from his seat, embraced him, and said to him: Very well, very well, my son! well-said, well-said, noble Brāhman! This is becoming to your keen intellect adorned by tranquillity.

The same term is used at the conclusion of Story.. ; Fausböll, -) Even when sick with heavy sorrow, the virtuous are disinclined to follow the road of the low-minded, being prevented from such actions by the firmness of their constancy.

atha teṣāṃ buddhirabhavat-kṛtyārūpamiva khalvidamatimanoharamasyā dārikāyā rūpacāturyam /	And they considered thus: The lovely beauty of that maiden is, in truth, of an exceedingly enchanting nature, it acts like a very magic spell.

iyaṃ hi saṃdarśanamātrakeṇa kuryānmunīnāmapi siddhivighnam / prāgeva bhāvārpitadṛṣṭivṛṣṭeryūnaḥ kṣitīśasya sukhe sthitasya //	The sight of her would be sufficient to put an obstacle in the way even of Munis striving after perfect wisdom, how much more may it obstruct the success of a young prince, who lives in pleasure, and is in the habit of directing his looks to the objects of sense.

atha sa rājā prakāmamantaḥ purasundarīṇāṃ vapurvilāsaiḥ kalitekṣaṇo 'pi /	Accordingly, while the king, curious to behold the splendour of his capital, was looking. On beholding her, the monarch,,.

For it is no human figure she has. Thus the king considered and could not look enough at her; and the chariot passing away did not comply with his heart's desire.
atha sa rājā śūnyahṛdaya iva tadgataikāgramanāḥ svabhavanamupetya manmathākṣiptadhṛtiḥ sunandaṃ sārathiṃ rahasi paryapṛcchat-	He went back to his palace, like one absent-minded, thinking of nothing but her; his firmness of mind had been confounded by Manmatha. So he asked his charioteer Sunanda secretly:.

The charioteer answered: Your Majesty has a high official named Abhipāraga.

After hearing this, the thought that she was the wife of another caused his heart to faint,. Often he heaved long and deep sighs, and thinking of nothing but her, said in a low voice to himself:.

In such a way the king's firmness was shaken by the power of passionate love. And although he endeavoured to compose his mind, his languishing appearance and emaciating body, his frequent absorption in thoughts together with his sighs indicated very clearly his state of being in love.
dhṛtyā mahatyāpi niguhyamānaḥ sa bhūpatestasya manovikāraḥ / mukhena cintāstimitekṣaṇena kārśyena ca vyaktimupājagāma //	However great his firmness was in disguising his heart's disease, it manifested itself in his countenance, his eyes rigid from thoughtfulness, and his emaciated limbs.

So he asked the king for a secret audience; which having been granted to him, he went up to his master, and having obtained permission, thus addressed him:,.
adyārcayantaṃ naradeva devān sākṣādupetyāmburuhākṣa yakṣaḥ / māmāha nāvaiṣi nṛpasya kasmādunmādayantyāṃ hṛdayaṃ niviṣṭam //	While engaged in worshipping the Devas to-day, lotus-eyed ruler of men, see, a Yakṣa, presenting himself before my eyes, said to me: How is it that you ignore the king having fallen in love with Unmādayantī? After speaking so, he disappeared immediately, and, solicitous on this account, approached you.
taccettathā deva kimetadevamasmāsu te niṣpraṇayatvamaunam //18 /\ tatpratigrahītumenāmarhati madanugrahārthaṃ deva iti /	If this is true, why, Your Majesty, do you show in this manner your disaffection to me by your silence? Therefore, may Your Majesty do me the favour of accepting her from my hand. The king was confounded, and dared not lift up his eyes for shame.
atha rājā pratyādeśāllajjāvanatavadano madanavaśagato 'pi svabhyastadharmasaṃjñatvādaviklavībhūtadhairyaḥ pratyākhyānaviśadākṣaramenamuvāca-naitadasti /	Nevertheless, even though he was in the power of Love, he did not suffer his firmness to falter, thanks to his being conversant with the Law by long and good practice, and refused that offer in plain terms. No, that may not be.
kutaḥ?	For what reason? Hear.

Abhipāraga answered: Do not fear, Your Majesty, that you will transgress the Law herein.
dāne sāhāyyadānena dharma eva bhavettava / dānavighnāttvadharmaḥ syāttāṃ matto 'pratigṛhṇataḥ //	By assisting in the performance of a gift you will act in accordance with the Law, whereas by not receiving her from my hand you would do wrong, since you obstruct the practice of giving.
kīrtyuparodhāvakāśamapi cātra devasya na paśyāmi /	Nor do see in this matter any occasion of damage to the reputation of Your Majesty.
āvābhyāmidamanyaśca ka eva jñātumarhati /	This is an arrangement between us; nobody else need know of it.

kutaḥ?	Why so?.

Abhipäraga said: If Your Majesty will not take her, because she is my wife, then myself will command her to lead the life of a harlot, whom no one is forbidden to woo.
tata enāṃ devaḥ pratigṛhṇīyāditi / rājovāca- kimunmatto 'si?	Then Your Majesty may take her. The king answered: Are you mad?.

The king said: No doubt it is your great affection for me that prompts you to the effort to promote my interest without considering what is right and wrong on your side.
ata eva tu tvāṃ viśeṣato nopekṣitumarhāmi /	But this very consideration induces me the more to prevent you.
naiva khalu lokāpavādaniḥśaṅkena bhavitavyam /	Verily, indifference as to the censure of men cannot at any rate be approved.

In this manner, then, the virtuous, even when sick with heavy sorrow, are disinclined to follow the road of the low-minded, being prevented from such actions by the firmness of their constancy [and their being conversant with the Law by long and good practice.

So it once happened that merchants who trafficked with Goldland, coming from Bharukaccha, longing for a prosperous voyage, touched at the town of Supāraga and requested that Great Being to embark with them.
sa tānuvāca-	He answered them:.

Old age, having got power over me, makes my eyesight diminish; in consequence of the many toils have endured, my attentiveness has grown weak, and even in my bodily occupations feel my strength almost gone. The exact meaning of the Sanskrit terms āharaṇa and apaharaṇa is doubtful, but must be something like this.

And the merchants, in this way invigorated by the Great Being, longing for the sight of land and looking down into the sea, beheld beings who had the figure of men and looked as if they wore silver armour; they saw them diving up and down the water-surface.

Supāraga said: These are no men nor demons, but fishes, to be sure.
yato na bhetavyamebhyaḥ /	Do not be afraid of them.

But they could not veer on account of the vehemence of the high running sea and of the strong wind, which continued to blow after them and drive the ship in the same direction.

It seems to bear on its surface fluid moon-beams, as it were, and to show all around a laughing face. Supāraga said: Alas! we are penetrating too far.

Now, having crossed also that sea, the merchants perceived another sea, whose rolling waves were tinged with the splendour of gold resembling the red-brown colour of flames, and filled with amazement and curiosity they spoke about it to Supāraga.
supāraga uvāca-	Supäraga answered:.

Thus saying the Great Being, far-seeing as he was, told them only the name of that sea, but concealed the cause of the change of colour of the water.

Supāraga said: Say, merchants, you should now make efforts to turn back.

kuśamālī samudro 'yamatyaṅkuśa iva dvipaḥ / prasahyasahyasalilo haran harati no ratim //	This is the sea named Kuśamālin. Like an elephant not heeding the goad, it drags forcibly along with its irresistible waves, and will take away our enjoyment.

Then perceiving another sea, the water of which had a greenish colour like that proceeding from the united brilliancy of emeralds and beryls, they asked Supāraga:.
marakataharitaprabhairjalairvahati navāmiva śādvalaśriyam / kumudaruciraphenabhūṣaṇaḥ salilanidhiḥ katamo 'yamīkṣyate //	Its waters have the green shine of emeralds and resemble a splendid meadow; they are adorned with foam as lovely as waterlilies.

Upon this the Great Being, whose heart ached as he foresaw the calamity which was about to befall the merchants, heaved a long and deep sigh, and said in a low tone: = wearing kusa-garlands..

When they heard that answer, the poor merchants were utterly afflicted. Their minds lost their energy, their limbs became powerless, and sitting down in dull sadness, they did nothing but sigh.

This noise rising from the sea may be compared to that of a sea swelling in rage, or of many thunderclaps together, or of bamboo-groves having caught fire and crackling.

And the merchants, being shown the fit places all along by the deities, who did so out of affection and veneration for Supāraga, drew up from thence what they meant to be sand and stones, and loaded their ship with that burden. But, in fact, that sand and those stones were beryls and other jewels.

When the Great Being had pronounced these words, there happened a miracle, occasioned by the power of his veracity joined to the store of his merit and to the favour shown to him by Devas, Snakes and Yaksas, who put into effect their might. In all parts of the sky there appeared. They were hanging low, being loaded with rain; the deep and soft sound of approaching thunder was heard out of them; while flashes of lightning adorned their big and dark-blue tops, they were spreading over the sky, as if they embraced each other with their heads and arms gradually approaching.

These accessories together with the incessant illumination by lightning gave the effect of great merriness and laughter irradiating those cloud-masses. Then the clouds let loose streams of rain, which fell down like pearls loosened from their shells.

The sun-rays, though their power had reached its highest degree because of the hot season, were now hidden, and currents of water ran down from the mountains, troubling their banks with the rows of foam which they deposited.

So that conflagration, pushed forward as if pressed on by the violent wind, and following the grasses and shrubs, reached at last the vicinity of that nest.

But the Bodhisattva's mind was purified by that delicious and comforting ambrosia, the name of which is detachment. His heart clung to it, for he knew well the difference between the life of a householder and the forest-life; and the invitation to enjoy worldly pleasures had the same effect of discomfort upon him, as talking of a meal would have upon one who is satiated. So he spoke:.
sukhasaṃjñāṃ tu mā kārṣīḥ kadācidguhacārake //	Nevertheless, do not employ the term comfort, when speaking of one who lives in the world..
gārhasthyaṃ mahadasvāsthyaṃ sadhanasyādhanasya vā /	The householder's state is a state of great uneasiness, whether he have money or not.
ekasya rakṣaṇāyāsāditarasyārjanaśramāt // yatra nāma sukhaṃ naiva sadhasyādhanasya vā /	Now, since there is no comfort to be found in that state either for the rich or for the poor, it is mere folly to delight in it.
tatrābhiratisaṃmohaḥ pāpasyaiva phalodayaḥ //	It must have such consequences as are the result of wickedness.
yadapi ceṣṭaṃ gṛhasthenāpi śakyamayamārādhayituṃ dharma iti kāmamevametat /	As to your statement that a householder, too, may be able to observe the precepts of the Law, certainly, this is true.
atiduṣkaraṃ tu me pratibhāti dharmapratipakṣasaṃbādhatvācchramabāhulyācca gṛhasya /	But it is a very, very difficult thing, methinks. The life in the world is crowded with business quite adverse to the precepts of the Law, and implies a great amount of toil.
paśyatu bhavān /	Do but consider it well, sir.
gṛhā nānīhamānasya na caivāvadato mṛṣā / na cānikṣiptadaṇḍasya pareṣāmanikurvataḥ //	The life of a householder is not suitable for one who desires nothing, nor for such a one as never speaks a falsehood, nor for him who never uses violence, nor for such a one as never injures others.
tadayaṃ gṛhasukhāvabaddhahṛdayastatsādhanodyatamatirjanaḥ /	And he whose heart is attached to the comfort of home-life, cannot but strive to put into effect the means by which this is secured.

It is tranquillity from which the road of the Law derives its flavour, but the success of a householder requires him to follow the way of courageous enterprise. Now, as the life of a householder is reprehensible for this reason, that it is in opposition to the Law, who, then, having got the true insight of his Self, will keep to it? He, indeed, whom the.

api ca / sukho gṛhavāsa iti śraddhāgamyamidaṃ me pratibhāti /	Further should think, the statement that living in the world procures happiness is only supported by belief (not by evidence).
niyatārjanarakṣaṇādiduḥkhe vadhabandhavyasanaikalakṣyabhūte /	The pain caused by earning wealth or by guarding it never ceases for the householder. He is more than anybody else exposed to murder, captivity, and other calamities.
nṛpaterapi yatra nāsti tṛptirvibhavaistoyanidherivāmbuvarṣaiḥ //	Even if a king, he would not be satisfied with his riches, no more than the sea may be with showers of rain.
sukhamatra kutaḥ kathaṃ kadā vā parikalpapraṇayaṃ na cedupaiti / viṣayopaniveśane 'pi mohādvraṇakaṇḍūyanavatsukhābhimānaḥ //	Why can there be happiness in that state, or how, or when, if man does not attain by it the longing for self-perfection, but on the contrary in his infatuation fancies happiness is to be obtained by attachment to sensual objects? Such a person may be compared to one who tries to heal his wounds by rubbing.
bāhulyena ca khalu bravīmi-	As a rule, in truth, dare say,.
prāyaḥ samṛddhyā madameti gehe mānaṃ kulenāpi balena darpam /	As a rule, material prosperity makes the householder arrogant, nobility of extraction makes him proud, strength makes him insolent.
duḥkhena roṣaṃ vyasanena dainyaṃ	His anger is roused by grief, and adversity puts him to dejection.
tasmin kadā syātpraśamāvakāśaḥ /\	At what time may that state offer an opportunity for tranquillity?.
madamānamohabhujagopalayaṃ	It is haunted by the serpents named arrogance, pride, and infatuation.
praśamābhirāmasukhavipralayam /	In it the lovely happiness of tranquillity comes to ruin.
ka ivāśrayedabhimukhaṃ vilayaṃ	Who then should choose that abode that tends to dissolution?.
bahutīvraduḥkhanilayaṃ nilayam // saṃtuṣṭajanagehe tu praviviktasukhe vane /	In the forest, on the other hand, that home of the nothing desirers, the mind is calm, enjoying the happiness of detachment.
prasīdati yathā cetastridive 'pi tathā kutaḥ //	Can there exist so great a contentment in Sakra's heaven?.

adharmamiśraṃ tu sukhaṃ na kāmaye	do not long for such happiness as is tainted with unrighteousness.

These persuasive words did not fail to make an impression on his paternal friend, who showed his high respect to the Great Being by entertaining him with a meal in the most distinguished manner.
tadevaṃ śīlapraśamapratipakṣasaṃbādhaṃ gārhasthyamityevamātmakāmāḥ parityajantīti /	In this manner, then, those who long only for the Self abandon the state of a householder, understanding that it is beset with occupations inimical to religious conduct and to tranquillity.
labdhāsvādāḥ praviveke, na kāmeṣvāvartanta iti pravivekaguṇakathāyāmapyupaneyam //	[When treating of the virtue of detachment, this is to be propounded: Those who have once got the taste for detachment will not go back to worldly pleasures.] The Pāli version of this story is not found in the Pāli Jātaka nor in the Cariyapiṭaka.

tadyathanuśrūyate-	This will be taught as follows.
bodhisattvaḥ kila kasmiṃścinmahati guṇaprakāśayaśasi vācyadoṣavirahite brāhmaṇakule janmaparigrahaṃ cakāra /	One time the Bodhisattva was born in an illustrious family of Brāhmans, far-famed for their virtues and their freedom from reprehensible vices.

Attending on his father and mother with the utmost piety, yea, worshipping them like deities, and instructing his brothers in different branches of science like a spiritual teacher or a father, he dwelt in the world, being skilled in the art of dealing with worldly affairs, and distinguished by his good manners.

eṣa lokasya niyataḥ śokātivirasaḥ kramaḥ / saha sthitvāpi suciraṃ mṛtyunā yadviyojyate //	This is the necessary order of things in the world and a source of grief and excessive pain, that Death separates us at last from those with whom we have lived together for a time, however long.

Let all of you be intent on loving and respecting each other, take care not to slacken your regard of the moral precepts and the practice of a righteous behaviour, keep up the assiduous study of the Veda, be prepared to meet the wishes of your friends, your guests, and your kinsmen.

For this reason, the state of life which is yours, that will be ours, too.
vayamapi pravrajāma iti // bodhisattva uvāca-	We too will renounce the world. The Bodhisattva answered:.
anabhyāsādvivekasya kāmarāgānuvartinaḥ /	People who have not familiarised themselves with Detachment cannot but follow after worldly desires.
prapātamiva manyante pravrajyāṃ prāyaśo janāḥ //	As a rule they look upon it as the same thing to give up the world or to fall over a precipice.

On the shore of that lake they built as many huts of leaves as they numbered, one for each, placing them at some distance from one another, hidden in the shadow of the trees in the midst of a lovely solitude. There they lived, devoted to their self-imposed vows and observances, and having their minds bound to meditation.

In those discourses he exhorted to meditation, asserted the sinfulness of worldly pleasures, expatiated on the sense of satisfaction which is the result of detachment, blamed hypocrisy, loquacity, idleness and other vices, and made a deep impression on his audience.
sā cainān dāsī bahumānānurāgavaśā tathaiva paricacāra /	Now, their maid-servant, prompted by respect and affection, did not cease to attend upon them still in the forest.

Then those holy men, after performing the proper and usual prayers and libations, would come to the lake-side one after The former happened at daytime, the latter in the nights bright with moonshine.. There they would enjoy the meal in the prescribed manner and pass the rest of the time absorbed in meditation.

Śakra, the Lord of the Devas, having heard of their reputation, came to their abode for the purpose of trying them.

After announcing the mealtime to the holy ascetics, as usual, by the noise of the clashing pieces of wood, she withdrew. At this moment Śakra, with the object of trying the Bodhisattva, made the very first share disappear (from the lotus-leaf)..
pravartane hi duḥkhasya tiraskāre sukhasya ca / dhairyaprayāsaḥ sādhūnāṃ visphuranniva gṛhyate //	When mishap arises and happiness disappears, then there is opportunity for measuring the constancy of the virtuous, as it cannot fail to start into view.

Then, without feeling agitation or anger in his heart, he went back to his hut, where he entered upon his practices of meditation, as he was wont to do.

His cheeks looked hollow, his eyes were sunken, the splendour of his face had faded, his sonorous voice had lost its full sound. Yet, however emaciated, he was lovely to behold like the crescent; for his virtues, wisdom, constancy, tranquillity had not.
upetyopacārapuraḥsaraṃ sasaṃbhramāḥ kimidamiti kārśyanimittamenamapṛcchan /	Accordingly, after coming into his presence and paying him the usual homage, they asked him with anxious excitement the cause of that emaciation.

The second brother said:.

May he who took thy lotus-stalks even once, be a husbandman who, having obtained wealth in consequence of his husbandry and delighting in the prattle of his children, enjoys the home-life without thinking of the time when he must retire from the world! The fourth brother spoke:.

The fifth brother spoke:.

The sixth brother said:.

sahāya uvāca-	follow the explication of the Pāli commentary..
catuḥśataṃ grāmavaraṃ samṛddhaṃ labdhvā narendrādupayātu bhoktum / avītarāgo maraṇaṃ sa caitu lobhaṃ biṣeṣvapyajayanna yaste // dāsa uvāca-	May that person who ventured to take the lotus-stalks of such a being as you, be a woman of resplendent beauty and The said four plenties are thus explained in the commentary on the Pāli Jātaka, which proves here of essential help, since catuḥśatam of the Sanskrit text is a wrong Sanskritisation of Pāli catussadaṁ, and does not suit the context.
sa grāmaṇīrastu sahāyamadhye strīnṛttagītairupalāpyamānaḥ /	Both the Sanskrit and the Pāli redaction have here the masculine pronoun demonstrative.
bhaginyuvāca-	The fault, must be a very ancient one.
yoṣitsahasrāgrasarīṃ karotu yastvadvidhasyāpi bisānyahārṣīt //	In the imprecation of the female servant the grammatical gender is respected by Śūra, not so in the Jātaka..
dāsyuvāca- ekākinī sā samatītya sādhūn svādūpabhoge praṇayaṃ karotu / satkāralabdhāṃ mudamudvahantī bisānyapaśyattava yā na dharmam // atha tatra dharmaśravaṇārthaṃ samāgatāstadvanādhyuṣitā yakṣadviradavānarāstāṃ kathāmupaśrutya pasrāṃ vrīḍāṃ saṃvegaṃ copajagmuḥ /	May she much delight in eating sweetmeats alone stealthily, disregarding the pious, and be greatly rejoiced when she gets a dainty dish, she who set her heart on thy lotus-stalks, not on thy righteousness! Now three inhabitants of the forest had also come to that place to hear the preaching of the Law, namely a Yakṣa, an elephant, and a monkey. They had heard the conversation and were overcome with the utmost shame and confusion.
atha yakṣa ātmaviśuddhipradarśanārthamiti śapathameṣāṃ purataścakāra-	Among them, the Yakṣa attested his innocence, uttering in their presence this solemn protestation:.
āvāsikaḥ so 'stu mahāvihāre kacaṅgalāyāṃ navakarmikaśca /	May he who failed against thee for the sake of the lotus stalks, have his residence in the Great Monastery, entrusted with the charge of the reparations in (the town of) Kacangalā, and make one window every day! The elephant spoke: This imprecation alludes to the story of a certain devaputra, who in the time of the Buddha Kāśyapa dwelt in the said monastery and was obliged to do the labour imposed on him, whereby he suffered much.
ālokasaṃdhiṃ divasaiḥ karotu yastvayyapi praskhalito visārtham //	brief account of that tale is given in the commentary on the Pāli Jātaka, where the speaker of this stanza is called a Devatā, not a Yakṣa..
hastyuvāca- ṣaḍbhirdṛḍhaiḥ pāśaśataiḥ sa bandhaṃ prāpnotu ramyācca vanājjanāntam / tīkṣṇāṅkuśākarṣaṇajā rujaśca yaste muniśreṣṭha bisānyahārṣīt //	May he come into captivity from the lovely forest into the company of men, fettered with six hundred solid chains, and suffer pain from the sharp goads of his driver, he who took thy lotus-stalks, most excellent of Munis! The monkey said:.
sa puṣpamālī trapughṛṣṭakaṇṭho yaṣṭyā hataḥ sarpamukhaṃ paraitu / vaikakṣyabaddhaśca vasedgṛheṣu laulyādahārṣīttava yo bisāni // atha bodhisattvastān sarvānevāsnunayavinītākṣaraṃ śāntigāmbhīryasūcakamityuvāca-	May he who moved by greediness took thy lotus-stalks wear a flower-garland and a tin collar rubbing his neck, and beaten with a stick pass before the face of a serpent, and with a long wreath hanging from his shoulder, live in the houses (of men)! In reply, the Bodhisattva addressed all of them with words both persuasive and kind, indicating how deep-rooted was his dispassionateness.
upaitu gehāśrita eva mṛtyuṃ bhavatsu yaḥ śaṅkata īdṛśaṃ vā //	May he who falsely said they have disappeared, though he had them, obtain to his heart's desire worldly pleasures and die a householder.
atha śakro devendrastena teṣāṃ kāmopabhogaprātikūlyasūcakena śapathātiśayena samutpāditavismayabahumānaḥ svenaiva vapuṣābhijvalatā tānṛṣīnabhigamya sāmarṣavaduvāca-mā tāvadbhoḥ /	May the same be the fate of him who suspects you of a similar action! Those extraordinary protestations of them, indicative of their abhorrence of the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, roused the astonishment and respect of Sakra, the Lord of the Devas. He made suppose the author of the Sanskrit original did not understand the meaning of the text he Sanskritised.
yatprāptiparyutsukamānasānāṃ sukhārthināṃ naiti manāṃsi nidrā / yatprāptumicchanti tapaḥśramaiśca tān kena kāmāniti kutsayadhve // bodhisattva uvāca-anantādīnavā mārṣa kāmāḥ /	Those enjoyments to obtain which everybody who longs for happiness strives after to such a degree as to banish sleep from his eyes and to undertake any form of penance and toil you censure, calling them worldly pleasures! Why do you judge so? The Bodhisattva spoke: Sensual enjoyments are accompanied by endless sins, sir.
saṃkṣepatastu śrūyatāṃ yadabhisamīkṣya kāmānna praśaṃsanti munayaḥ /	Why, hear then, will tell thee concisely, what the Munis have in view that makes them blame sensual enjoyments.
kāmeṣu bandhamupayāti vadhaṃ ca lokaḥ śokaṃ klamaṃ bhayamanekavidhaṃ ca duḥkham /	On account of them, men incur captivity and death, grief, fatigue, danger, in short manifold sufferings.
kāmārthameva ca mahīpatayaḥ patanti dharmopamardarabhasā narakaṃ paratra //	For the sake of them, kings are eager to oppress righteousness, and consequently fall into hell after death.
yatsauhṛdāni sahasā virasībhavanti yannītiśāṭhyamalinena pathā prayānti / kīrtya viyogamasukhaiḥ parataśca yogaṃ yatprāpnuvanti nanu kāraṇamatra kāmāḥ //	When the ties of friendship are suddenly loosened, when men enter the road of political wisdom, that unclean path of falseness, when they lose their good reputation and hereafter come to meet with sufferings is it not sensual enjoyments that are the cause thereof?.
iti hīnavimadhyamottamānāmiha cāmutra ca yadvadhāya kāmāḥ / kupitān bhujagānivātmakāmā munayastāniti śakra nāśrayante //	Now, since worldly pleasures in this manner tend to the destruction of all conditions of men, the highest, the middle and the lowest, both in this world and in the next, the Munis, Śakra, who long only for the Self, keep aloof from them, as they would from angry serpents..
guṇasaṃbhāvanāvyaktiryatparīkṣyopalabhyate /	high opinion of virtue may be tested by trial.
mayā vinihitānyasmātparīkṣārthaṃ bisāni vaḥ //	Thus considering, hid the lotus-stalks in order to try you.
tatsanāthaṃ jagaddiṣṭyā munibhistathyakīrtibhiḥ /	And now, how fortunate is the world in that it possesses such Munis as you, whose glory is tested by fact.

With these words he handed the stalks over to the Bodhisattva. But the Bodhisattva reproved his unbecoming and audacious way of proceeding in terms though modest, yet expressive of noble self-esteem.
na bāndhavā naiva vayaṃ sahāyā na te naṭā nāpi viḍambakāḥ smaḥ /	We are no kinsfolk of thine, nor thy comrades, nor are we thy actors or buffoons.
kasminnavaṣṭabhya nu devarāja krīḍāpathenaivamṛṣīnupaiṣi // ityukte śakro devendraḥ sasaṃbhramāpāstakuṇḍalakirīṭavidyudbhāsuravadanaḥ sabahumānamabhipraṇamyainaṃ kṣamayāmāsa-	What, then, is the reason for thy coming here, Lord of the Devas, to play with Ṛṣis in this manner? At these words Śakra, the Lord of the Devas, hastily divested himself of his divine appearance, brilliant with his ear-rings, his head ornament, and his lightning, and respectfully bowing to the Bodhi sattva, spoke thus in order to appease him:.
uktaprayojanamidaṃ cāpalaṃ mama nirmama / pitevācārya iva ca kṣantumarhati tadbhavān //	thou who art free from all selfishness, deign to forgive me the thoughtless deed did with the aforesaid purpose; pardon it like a father, like a teacher!.
nimīlitajñānavilocanānāṃ svabhāva eṣa skhalituṃ same 'pi /	It is proper, indeed, to those whose eyes are not yet opened to wisdom, to offend against others, be they even their equals.
kṣamāṃ ca tatrātmavatāṃ prapattumato 'pyadaścetasi mā sma kārṣīḥ //	Likewise it is proper to (the wise) who know the Self, to pardon such offences. Also for this reason, pray do not feel anger in thy heart concerning that deed!.
iti kṣamayitvā śakrastatraivāntardadhe // tadevaṃ pravivekasukharasajñānāṃ viḍambaneva vihiṃseva ca kāmāḥ pratikūlā bhavanti //	In this manner, then, those who have learnt to appreciate the happiness of detachment are hostile to worldly pleasures; they will oppose them like one opposes a deception, an injury. In the original some lines follow here, bracketed by the editor.
[taccedaṃ jātakaṃ bhagavān vyākārṣīt-	This is its translation ‘And this jātaka has thus been explained by the Lord: -.
ahaṃ śāradvatīputro maudgalyāyanakāśyapau / pūrṇāniruddhāvānanda ityāsurbhrātarastadā //	, the son of Saradvatī [viz. Śäriputra], Maudgalyāyana, Kāśyapa, Pūrṇa, Aniruddha, and Ānanda, we were the brothers of that time.

He had lofty aspirations and a clever intellect, loved honest practices in business, and owing to his thorough study of many branches of science, attracted notice by his elegance of speech. Compassionate as he was and in the possession of a large estate, he made the bliss of his wealth flow in all directions by his great gifts of charity.

And does he know how to show you attention? He does not grieve you by misconduct, hope? And she answered with downcast looks bashfully.

It is a pity! Fie upon the bad management of Destiny, that men can leave their beloved relations without being withheld by Compassion, or that they can be successful even in the slightest part of the holiness they pursue! When the Bodhisattva's wife heard those piteous and sincere lamentations of her mother on account of her husband having renounced the world, she grew alarmed (being impressionable) after the nature of women. Her disturbed countenance expressed the dejection of her mind shaken by the sudden assault of sorrow and pain. She wholly forgot the subject and the connection of the conversation, and reflected: My husband has forsaken the world, and my mother on hearing the sad news has come here in order to comfort me. Having thus made up her mind, the young, girlish woman began to lament and to weep, and with a loud cry swooned away.

If however they prefer their homes to me, why are they prodigal of their tears?. But granted that attachment to their family prevents them from adopting the state of an ascetic, how is it that the like consideration did not formerly present itself to them on so many battle-fields?.

Of a truth, since they are unable to perceive the evils, however obvious, inherent in the home-life, nor the virtues to be found in the penance-groves, the eye of knowledge is shut to them!.

Fie upon their infatuation!. , those very sins by the delusions of which these friends of mine and the whole of the creatures are prevented from tranquillity, will crush down forcibly whenever shall have obtained by residence in the penance-forest the excellent power of doing so! Of such a kind were his reflections.

tadevamabhūtaguṇasaṃbhāvanā pratodasaṃcodaneva bhavati sādhūnāmiti guṇasaṃpādane prayatitavyam /	In this manner, then, an unfounded opinion of their possession of some virtue acts upon the virtuous in the same way as a stirring spur. Thus considering, one ought to strive after the realisation of virtues..

His wife, who loved him much, likewise cut off her hair, and forsook the care of apparelling her body and beautifying it with ornaments.

tadalamasmadanugamanaṃ pratyanena vyavasāyena te /	Do not persist in your determination of being my companion in the forest.
yatraiva tvanyāḥ pravrajitāsḥ prativasanti tatra bhavatyāstābhireva sārdhaṃ pratirūpaṃ vastuṃ syāt /	It would rather be suitable for you to take up your abode in such a place where other women dwell who have forsaken the world; with them you should live.

But it is because cannot bear to live without you, that you must pardon this lack of obedience to your orders. And though he repeated his entreaties, she never would turn back.

One day after meal-time he performed the usual rite of profound meditation (dhyāna) in a lonely part of some forest. It was a splendid landscape, adorned with many groves of trees affording much shade, and waited on, as it were, by the sunbeams peeping here and there through the thick foliage with the softness of the moonlight; the dust of various flowers overspread the ground; in short, it was a fair spot..

On all sides young and tender shoots abounded; the soft humming of crowds of bees roaming about was heard, as well as the cries of joy uttered by the lascivious cuckoos; the lakes and ponds, adorned with laughing lotuses and waterlilies, were an attraction for the eyes; there blew soft winds scented with the odours and perfumes of manifold blossoms.

atha sa rājā savinayamabhigamya bodhisattvaṃ kṛtapratisaṃmodanakathastatraikānte nyaṣīdat /	On seeing the Bodhisattva, the king respectfully drew near to him, and after the usual ceremonial greetings and complimentary words, sat down apart.

Having thus considered, the king, desirous of proving that penance-powers spoke to the Bodhisattva, as if he wished his good. Say, ascetic, this world abounds in rogues and bold adventurers. Why, it is not fit for Your Reverence to have with you such a handsome person as this companion of your religious duties in remote forests, where you are destitute of protection.

Indulging in anger, forsooth, agitates the mind and destroys the glory of a religious life, since it tends to the detriment of it.
vasatviyaṃ tena janānta eva strīṃsaṃnikarṣeṇa ca kiṃ yatīnām /\ bodhisattva uvāca-yuktamāha mahārājaḥ /	Of what use, after all, is female company to ascetics? The Bodhisattva said: Your Majesty has spoken truth.

Then the king thought: He takes a great interest in her, he does not possess penance-power, and despising the Great Being, was no longer afraid of injuring him.

On hearing this order, she, like a deer assailed by a ferocious animal, showed her fear, alarm, and dismay by her (changed) countenance, her eyes filled with tears, and overpowered by her grief, she lamented in a faltering voice somewhat in this manner:.
lokasya nāmārtiparājitasya parāyaṇaṃ bhūmipatiḥ piteva /	To mankind, overcome by sufferings, the king is the best refuge, it is said, like a father.

bhraṣṭādhikārā bata lokapālā na santi vā mṛtyuvaśaṃ gatā vā /	Alas! The guardians of the world-quarters (lokapālās) have been dismissed from their office, or they do not exist at all, or they are dead, since they make no effort to protect the oppressed.

And must live to see this, wretched woman that am!.

But ascetics ought to behave with compassion towards any one in distress. Is not this their proper line of conduct?.

Is then this catastrophe the happiness longed for through the fulfilment of my own wish though contrary to yours? While she thus lamented and what else could she do, that female ascetic, but cry and wail and weep in piteous accents? the royal attendants, obeying the orders of the king, placed her on a chariot, and before the very eyes of the Great Being carried her off to the zenana.
badhisattvo 'pi pratisaṃkhyānabalātpratinudya krodhabalaṃ tathaiva pāṃsukūlāni niḥsaṃkṣobhaḥ praśāntacetāḥ sīvyati sma /	The Bodhisattva, however, had repressed his powerful anger by the power of his tranquillity, and was sewing his rags just as before without the slightest perturbation, as calm and serene as ever.

That excessive firmness of mind of the Bodhisattva, proved by his tranquillity, did not fail to inspire the king with respect for the virtues of the ascetic. And he began to reflect: This Brahman must have hinted at something else, speaking thus, and, not understanding his mind, committed a rash action. This reflection arising within him, induced him to ask the Bodhisattva:.
ko 'nyastavābhūtpratikūlavartī yo visphuranneva na te vimuktaḥ / reṇuḥ samudyanniva toyadena kaścopanītaḥ praśamaṃ tvayātra // bodhisatttva uvāca- śṛṇu mahārāja /	Who was that other who acted against you and was not released by you, however much he struggled, no more than rising dust is by a rain-cloud? Whom did you quiet then? The Bodhisattva answered: Hearken, great prince.

And lying on a precious couch, he does not rest at his ease, his heart being wounded by the arrow of anger.

Their magnificent figures resemble pure gold, their voices utter articulate speech, righteousness is the rule of their modest.

So he said to his ministers, who were very clever, having studied many branches of science: Well, sirs, set to work the cleverness of your minds, and try to devise some means by which might obtain at least the sight of those two excellent swans. Then those wise ministers let their thoughts range over the road of political wisdom, and (having discovered by thinking the means wanted) said to the king:.

The king accepted their proposal, and had a great lake, which by the splendour of its magnificence rivalled with Lake Mānasa, constructed in a short time in a place not too near the park which skirted his capital. It was a most charming basin of pure water, and very rich in water-plants, embracing various kinds of lotuses and waterlilies: padma, utpala, kumuda, pundarīka, saugandhika, tāmarasa, kahlāra.

In many other places, where it was covered with the lovely petals and filaments of lotuses and waterlilies, it showed a widespread splendour, as if it bore a gift of homage.
śriyaṃ pravitatāṃ bibhradupahāramayīmiva // prasannastimitāmbutvādvyaktacitravapurguṇaiḥ /	Another beauty was due to the limpidity and calmness of its water, which was so transparent as to show the sharp contours and the fair hues of its crowds of fishes, no less conspicuous while swimming beneath its surface than they would have been if moving in the sky.

One time, when autumn having drawn away the dark curtain of clouds, dispensed its beautiful gifts, enlarging the horizon clear and pure, the lakes were lovely to behold, with their limpid water and with the full brilliancy of their clusters of lotuses disclosed. It was the season when the Moon, with increased power of rays, as it were, reaches the highest pitch of loveliness and youthfulness, when Earth, adorned with the harvest-bliss of manifold crops, offers a fair aspect, and when the younger among the swans begin to show themselves. Now, a couple of swans, who belonged to that very tribe of the Bodhisattva, flew up from Lake Mānasa, and passing over different regions overspread with autumn's mildness, at last came to the realm of that king.

They heard the echoes of the confused sounds of crowds of birds and the humming of the bees who were busily roaming over its flowers. They smelt the scent of the dust of its lotuses and waterlilies scattered about by the gentle, cool, and soft breezes, which seemed to.

Your Majesty, south of Mount Himavat, they said, there lives at Benares a king of men, named Brahmadatta, who has delivered to the birds a.

Sumukha, after bowing his head, answered: deem it unfit for Your Majesty to go there.

And, accompanied by Sumukha and a numerous crowd of swans, he set out in that direction, resembling the Moon-god with his attendant band of (white) autumn clouds.

As soon as they became aware of his approach, the two excellent birds became silent. Now, the Niṣāda seeing that the tribe of swans had flown away, was persuaded certainly, some one of them has been caught; and going round the different places, where he had laid down his snares, discovered those two foremost swans.

On hearing this, Sumukha addressed him with human language in a voice which distinctly articulated syllables and words, and by its sonorousness manifested the firmness of mind of the speaker, being employed to show his (virtuous) nature.

Upon this the Niṣāda, affected with high admiration and almost in ecstasy, once more asked Sumukha.

naivotsahe yena vihātumenam svajīvitasyāpyanurakṣaṇārtham // atha sumukhaḥ prasādavismayāvarjitamānasaṃ taṃ naiṣādamavetya punaruvāca-	On this account may never desert him, not even in order to save my own life. And observing the feelings of growing tenderness and admiration which appeared in the Niṣāda, he continued:.
apyasmākamiyaṃ bhadra saṃbhāṣā syātsukhodayā / apyasmān visṛjannadya dharmyāṃ kīrtimavāpnuyāḥ // naiṣāda uvāca-	Oh! If this our conversation might lead to a happy end, my friend! If thou wert to obtain the glory of a virtuous action by setting us free now! The Niṣāda spoke:.
no cedicchasi me duḥkhaṃ tatkuruṣva mamārthanām /	If thou dost not wish my sorrow, then thou must grant my request.
ekena yadi tuṣṭo 'si tattyajainaṃ gṛhāṇa mām //	If thou art content with one, well, leave him and take me.
tulyārohaparīṇāhau samānau vayasā ca nau /	Our bodies have an equal size and compass, and our age is the same, tell thee.
viddhi niṣkraya ityasya na te 'haṃ lābhahānaye //	So taking me as a ransom for him, thou wilt not lose thy profit.
tadaṅga samavekṣasva gṛddhirbhavatu te mayi / māṃ badhnātu bhavān pūrvaṃ paścānmuñceddvijādhipam //	that thou mayst be greedy to possess me! Thou mayst tie me first, and afterwards release the king of birds.
tāvāneva ca lābhaste kṛtā syānmama cārthanā / haṃsayūthasya ca prītirmaitrī tena tathaiva ca //	Thus doing, thou wouldst enjoy the same amount of gain, thou wouldst have granted my request, thou wouldst also cause gladness to the tribe of swans and obtain their friendship, too.
paśyantu tāvadbhavatā vimuktaṃ haṃsādhipaṃ haṃsagaṇāḥ pratītāḥ / virocamānaṃ nabhasi prasanne daityendranirmuktavimoḍḍurājam // atha sa naiṣādaḥ krūratābhyāsakaṭhinahṛdayo 'pi tena tasya jīvitanirapekṣeṇa svāmyanurāgaślāghinā kṛtajñatāguṇaujasvinā dhairyamādhuryālaṃkṛtavacasā samāvarjitahṛdayo vismayagauravavaśātsamānītāñjaliḥ sukhamuvāca-sādhu sādhu mahābhāga /	Now then, gladden the host of swans by setting their lord at liberty, that they may see him again in his resplendent beauty in the clear sky, resembling the Moon released from the Lord of Daityas (Rāhu). The Niṣāda, though accustomed to a cruel trade and hard-hearted by practice, was much touched by these words of the bird uttered in a firm yet soft tone and imposing by their import. For they magnified the attachment to one's master without minding one's own life, and were a strong manifestation of the virtue of gratitude. Overpowered by Literally: on whose body the hairs stood up..
mānuṣeṣvapyayaṃ dharma āścaryo daivateṣu vā / svāmyarthaṃ tyajatā prāṇān yastvayātra pradarśitaḥ //	If met with among men or deities, such self-denial would pass for a miracle, as is practised by thee claiming it thy duty to give up thy life for the sake of thy master.
tadeṣa te vimuñcāmi rājānamanumānayan /	will pay thee my homage, therefore, and set free thy king.
ko hi prāṇapriyatare tavāsmin vipriyaṃ caret // ityuktā sa naiṣādastasya nṛpateḥ saṃdeśamanādṛtya haṃsarājaṃ samanumānayan dayāsumukhaṃ pāśānmumoca //	Who, indeed, may be capable of doing evil to him who is dearer to thee than life? With these words the Niṣāda, without caring for the mandate of his king, listening to the voice of his compassion, paid honour to the king of swans, and released him from the snare.
atha sumukhaḥ senāpatirhaṃsarājavimokṣātparamānanditahṛdayaḥ prītyabhisnigdhamudīkṣamāṇo naiṣādamuvāca-	And Sumukha, the commander-in-chief, greatly rejoiced at the rescue of his king, fixed a glad and kind look on the Niṣāda and spoke:.
yathā suhṛnnandana nandito 'smi tvayādya haṃsādhipatervimokṣāt / evaṃ suhṛjjñātigaṇena bhadra śaratsahasrāṇi bahūni nanda //	As thou hast rejoiced me now by the release of the king of swans, thou source of gladness to thy friends, mayst thou in the same way be rejoiced with thy friends and kinsmen for many thousands of years!.
tanmā tavāyaṃ viphalaḥ śramo bhūdādāya māṃ haṃsagaṇādhipaṃ ca / svasthāvabaddhāvadhiropya kācamantaḥpure darśaya bhūmipāya //	Then, that thy labour may not be fruitless, well, take me and also this king of swans, and carrying us on thy shoulder-pole, free and unbound, show us to thy king in his zenana.

The Niṣāda acceded to his request, thinking, the king must see at all events this marvellous couple of swans, and placing them (in baskets).
upāyanāścaryamidaṃ draṣṭumarhasi mānada /	Deign to see, quoth he, the wonderful present offer you, my lord.
sasenāpatirānītaḥ so 'yaṃ haṃsapatirmayā // atha sa rājā praharṣavismayāpūrṇamatirdṛṣṭvā tau haṃsapradhānau kāñcanapuñjāviva śriyābhijvalanmanohararūpau taṃ naiṣādamuvāca-	Here is that famous king of swans, together with his commander-in-chief! On beholding those two foremost of swans, who by the glittering splendour of their lovely figures resembled two solid pieces of gold, the king filled with amazement and exulting with gladness said to the Niṣāda:.
svasthāvabaddhāvamukau vihaṃgau bhūmicāriṇaḥ / tava hastamanuprāptau kathaṃ kathaya vistaram // ityukte sa naiṣādaḥ praṇamya rājānamuvāca-	How didst thou obtain possession of those two who remain in thy hands, unhurt and unbound, though able to fly away from thee who art on foot? Tell it me at length. Being thus addressed, the Niṣāda bowing to the king, answered:.
nihitā bahavaḥ pāśā mayā dāruṇadāruṇāḥ / vihagākrīḍadeśeṣu pallaveṣu sarassu ca //	had laid down many snares, so cruel causes of pain, in pools and ponds, the places of recreation of the birds.
atha visrambhaniḥśaṅko haṃsavaryaścarannayam / paricchannena pāśena caraṇe samabadhyata //	Then this foremost of swans, moving unsuspectingly, owing to his trustfulness, got his foot entangled in a hidden snare.
ātmānaṃ niṣkrayaṃ kṛtvā haṃsarājasya jīvitam // visṛjanmānuṣīṃ vācaṃ vispaṣṭamadhurākṣarām /	The other, though free, was keeping him company, and entreated me to take him in redemption for the life of his king, uttering in a human voice articulate and sweet-sounding language.
svajīvitaparityāgādyācñāmapyūrjitakramām //	His ardent request derived its power from his readiness to sacrifice his own life.
tenāsya vākyena supeśalena svāmyarthadhīreṇa ca ceṣṭitena / tathā prasanno 'smi yathāsya bhartā mayā samaṃ krūratayaiva muktaḥ //	So great was the effect of his soft words and his strong deeds in behalf of his master, that was converted to tenderness, and dismissed his lord together with my own cruel temper.
atha vihagapaterayaṃ vimokṣānmuditamatirbahudhā vadan priyāṇi / tvadabhigama iti nyayojayanmāṃ viphalaguruḥ kila mā mama śramo bhūt //	After which, rejoiced at the release of the king of birds, he returned many thanks and blessings to me, and instructed me to go up in this manner to you, that my labour, so he said, should not have been a burden by lack of reward.
māmāpi hṛdi mārdavaṃ janitavān kṣaṇenaiva yaḥ / khagādhipatimokṣaṇaṃ kṛtamanusmaran matkṛte sahādhipatināgataḥ svayamayaṃ ca te 'ntaḥpuram // tadupa"rutya sa rājā sapramodavismayena manasā vividharatnaprabhodbhasurasurucirapādaṃ parārdhyāstaraṇaracanābhirāmaṃ śrīmatsukhopāśrayasāṭopamupahitapādapīṭhaṃ rājādhyāsanayogyaṃ kāñcanamāsanaṃ haṃsarājāya samādideśa, asmātyamukhyādhyāsanayogyaṃ ca vetrāsanaṃ sumukhāya //	And so it is out of gratitude for the deliverance of his king and in my behalf, that this most righteous being, whosoever he may be, who under the outward appearance of a bird roused in one moment tenderness of mind in the heart of a person like me, has arrived of his own accord together with his master at your zenana. The king was filled by these words with great joy and amazement. He assigned to the king of swans a golden throne with a footstool, a seat well becoming a king; for it had brilliant feet glittering with the lustre of various jewels, was spread with a most costly and lovely cover, and provided with a soft cushion on its back.
atha bodhisattvaḥ kāla idānīṃ pratisaṃmoditumiti nūpurārāvamadhureṇa svareṇa rājānamābabhāṣe-	Then the Bodhisattva, considering that it was now the proper time to make a complimentary address, spoke to the king in a voice as soft as the sound of anklets.
dyutikāntiniketane śarīre kuśalaṃ te kuśalārha kaccidasmin /	Thy body, adorned with lustre and loveliness, is in good health, hope, health-deserving prince.
api dharmaśarīramavraṇaṃ te vipulairucchvasitīva vākpradānaiḥ //	And so, hope, is also that other body of thine which is made up of thy righteousness.
api rakṣaṇadīkṣitaḥ prajānāṃ samayānugrahavigrahapravṛttyā / abhivardhayase svakīrtiśobhāmanurāgaṃ jagato hitodayaṃ ca // api śuddhatayopadhāsvasaktairanuraktairnipuṇakriyairamātyaiḥ /	Does it frequently emit, so to speak, its breath of pious discourses and gifts?. Thou hast dedicated thyself, hast thou not? to the task of protecting thy subjects, distributing reward or punishment in due time, so as to make both thy illustrious glory and the people's affection, together with their welfare, always increase?.
samavekṣayase hitaṃ prajānāṃ na ca tatrāsi parokṣabuddhireva // nayavikramasaṃhṛtapratāpairapi sāmantanṛpaiḥ prayācyamānaḥ / upayāsi dayānuvṛttiśobhāṃ na ca viśvāsamayīṃ pramādanidrām // api dharmasukhārthanirvirodhāstava ceṣṭā naravīra sajjaneṣṭāḥ /	Hast thou not the assistance of affectionate and honest ministers, averse to fraud and skilled in the management of affairs, with whom to consider the interest of thy subjects? Thy mind is not indifferent to this important matter, hope?. When the kings, thy vassals, after incurring abatement of their splendour by thy policy and vigour, entreat thee to show them mercy, thou wilt generously follow the impulse of pity, hope, without, however, indulging in trustfulness, which is nothing but the sleep of carelessness?.
vitatā iva dikṣu kīrtisiddhyā ripubhirniśvasitairasatkriyante //	In the Pāli redactions of our story, each question is immediately followed by its answer, which is affirmative, of course, and the wording of which exactly corresponds to the question..
adya me kuśalaṃ haṃsa sarvatra ca bhaviṣyati / cirābhilaṣitaḥ prāpto yadayaṃ satsamāgamaḥ //	Now my welfare is assured in every respect, swan, for have obtained the long wished-for happiness of meeting with your holy persons.
tvayi pāśavaśaṃ prāpte praharṣoddhatacāpalaḥ / kaccinnāyamakārṣītte daṇḍenābhirujan rujam // evaṃ hyamīṣāṃ jālmānaṃ pakṣiṇāṃ vyasanodaye / praharṣākulitā buddhirāpatatyeva kalmaṣam // bodhisattva uvāca-	This man, having captured thee in the snare, did not hurt thee, hope, in the exuberance of his joy with his pain-inflicting stick? So it happens, in fact, when there arises calamity to birds, that the mind of those knaves, soiled by exulting joy, impels them to sinful actions. The Bodhisattva spoke:.
na cāyaṃ kiṃcidasmāsu śatruvatpratyapadyata //	did not suffer, great king, while in that most distressing condition, nor did this man behave towards me at all like an enemy.
abaddhaṃ baddhavadayaṃ matsnehātsumukhaṃ sthitam / dṛṣṭvābhāṣata sāmnaiva sakautūhalavismayaḥ //	When he perceived Sumukha staying there, though uncaught, out of love for me, as if he, too, had been caught, he addressed him with great kindness, prompted by curiosity and astonishment.
sūnṛtairasya vacanairathavarjitamānasaḥ / māmayaṃ vyamucatpāśādvinayādanumānayan //	Afterwards, having been propitiated by the gentle words of Sumukha, he released me from the snare, and setting me free, showed respect and honour to me.
ataśca sumukhenedaṃ hitamasya samīhitam / ihāgamanamasmākaṃ syādasyāpi sukhodayam // nṛpatiruvāca-	It is for this reason that Sumukha, wishing this man's good, told him to bring us hither. May then our arrival cause happiness also to him! The king said.
ākāṅkṣitābhigamayoḥ svāgataṃ bhavatoriha / atīva prīṇitaścāsmi yuṣmatsaṃdarśanotsavāt //	Having eagerly longed for your arrival, bid welcome here to both of you. The sight of you is a feast to my eyes and causes me extreme gladness.
ayaṃ ca mahatārthena naiṣādo 'dya sameṣyati /	As to that Niṣāda, will bestow a rich gift upon him presently.
ubhayeṣāṃ priyaṃ kṛtvā mahadarhatyayaṃ priyam // ityuktvā sa rājā taṃ naiṣādaṃ mahatā dhanavistarapradānena saṃmānya punarhaṃsarājamuvāca-	Having shown kindness to both of you, he deserves a high reward. Then the king honoured the Niṣāda by a munificent gift of great wealth. After which, he again addressed the king of swans:.
imaṃ svamāvāsamupāgatau yuvāṃ visṛjyatāṃ tanmayi yantraṇāvratam / prayojanaṃ yena yathā taducyatāṃ bhavatsahāyā hi vibhūtayo mama //	Ye have come here to this residence, which is yours, indeed. Pray, set aside, then, cramping reserve with respect to me, and make known in what way and how may serve your wants. For my riches are at your service.
na tadvidhāṃ lambhayate sa tāṃ dhanairmahopakāraḥ praṇayaḥ suhṛtsvataḥ //	friend expressing his wants in frank speech, causes a greater satisfaction to a wealthy man, than he could obtain from his riches.
atha sa rājā sumukhasaṃbhāṣaṇakutūhalahṛdayaḥ savismayamabhivīkṣya sumukhamuvāca-	For this reason, unreservedness among friends is a great benefit. Then, being also very curious to converse with Sumukha, the king casting his admiring looks on him, addressed him thus:.
alabdhagādhā navasaṃstave jane na yānti kāmaṃ praṇayapragalbhatām / vacastu dākṣiṇyasamāhitākṣaraṃ na te na jalpantyupacāraśībharam //	Surely, new acquaintances are not bold enough to speak frankly to the newly acquired friend, in whose mind they have not yet got footing. Still, they will use at least kind language, adorned by courteous terms.
saṃbhāṣaṇenāpi yataḥ kartumarhati no bhavān /	It is for this reason that beg also Thy Honour to favour me with thy conversation.
sāphalyaṃ praṇayāśāyāḥ prīteścopacayaṃ hṛdi //	So thou wouldst realise my desire of acquiring thy friendship and increase the gladness of my heart..
mahendrakalpena saha tvayā saṃbhāṣaṇotsavaḥ /	conversation with thee who art great Indra's equal, is a kind of festival.
iti darśitasauhārde kasya nātimanorathaḥ //	Who, therefore, would not feel that this token of thy friendly disposition surpassed his wishes?,.
saṃbhāṣamāṇe tu narādhipe ca sauhārdaramyaṃ vihagādhipe ca / tatsaṃkathāmadhyamupetya dhārṣṭyānnanvakramaḥ preṣyajanasya vaktum // na hyeṣa mārgo vinayābhijātastaṃ caiva jānan kathamabhyupeyām /	But would it not have been an unbecoming act of insolence for an attendant to join in the conversation of the two monarchs, of men and of birds, while they were exchanging lovely words of friendship? No, a well-educated person does not act in that way.
tūṣṇīṃ mahārāja yataḥ sthito 'haṃ tanmarṣaṇīyaṃ yadi marṣaṇīyam // ityukte sa rājā sapraharṣavismayavadanaḥ saṃrādhayan sumukhamuvāca-	How, then, could, knowing this, follow that way? On this account, great prince, was silent, and if need thy pardon, deserve it. In reply to these words the king, expressing by his countenance his gladness and admiration, eulogised Sumukha.
sthāne bhavadguṇakathā ramayanti lokaṃ	Justly the world takes delight in hearing the fame of thy virtues.
sthāne 'si haṃsapatinā gamitaḥ sakhitvam /	Justly the king of swans made thee his friend.
evaṃvidhaṃ hi vinayaṃ nayasauṣṭhavaṃ ca naivākṛtātmahṛdayāni samudvahanti // tadiyaṃ prastutā prītirvicchidyeta yathā na naḥ /	Such modesty and accomplished demeanour is displayed by none but those who have subdued their inner self. Therefore sincerely trust that these friendly relations, now commenced between us, will never be broken off.
atha bodhisattvastasya rājñaḥ parāṃ prītikāmatāmavetya snehapravṛttisumukhatāṃ ca saṃrādhayannavocadenam-	The meeting of pious persons, indeed, produces friendship. Then the Bodhisattva, understanding that the king was eagerly desirous of their friendship and inclined to show them his affection, addressed him in terms of praise.
yatkṛtyaṃ parame mitre kṛtamasmāsu tattvayā / saṃstave hi nave 'pyasmin svamāhātmyānuvartinā //	Following the impulse of thy generous nature thou hast acted towards us as one should act to one's best friend, although our acquaintance has only been made just now.
kaśca nāma mahārāja nāvalambyeta cetasi /	Whose heart, then, would not be won, illustrious prince, by such honourable treatment as thou hast shown us?.
saṃmānavidhinānena yastvayāsmāsu darśitaḥ // prayojanaṃ nāma kiyatkimeva vā madāśrayaṃ mānada yattvamīkṣase / priyātithitvaṃ guṇavatsalasya te pravṛttamabhyāsaguṇāditi dhruvam // na citrametattvayi vā jitātmani prajāhitārthaṃ dhṛtapārthivavrate /	Whatever profit thou expectest from relations with me, lord, or however important thou mayst deem them, it is a matter of fact that thou hast displayed thy hospitable disposition by practising hospitality, thou lover of virtues!. But this is no wonder in a self-subdued prince such as thou, who bearest thy royal duties for the interest of thy subjects, intent on penance and profound contemplation, like a Muni.
tapaḥsamādhānapare munāviva svabhāvavṛttyā hi guṇāstvayi sthitāḥ //	Thou, in truth, hadst but to follow the inclination of thy excellent nature to become a storehouse of virtues.
iti praśaṃsāsubhagāḥ sukhā guṇā na doṣadurgeṣu vasanti bhūtayaḥ /	They afford happiness, but in the strongholds of vice there dwells no bliss.
imāṃ viditvā guṇadoṣadharmatāṃ sacetanaḥ kaḥ svahitotpathaṃ bhajet //	What conscious being, then, knowing this to be the constant law as to virtue and vice, would resort to the wrong way which diverges from his good?.
na deśamāpnoti parākrameṇa taṃ na kośavīryeṇa na nītisaṃpadā / śramavyayābhyāṃ nṛpatirvinaiva yaṃ guṇābhijātena pathādhigacchati //	Not by military prowess nor by the strength of his treasury nor by a successful policy will a prince reach that high rank, which he may obtain even without exertion and expense, if he but follow the right path which consists in the cultivation of virtues..
surādhipaśrīrapi vīkṣate guṇān guṇoditāneva paraiti saṃnatiḥ / guṇebhya eva prabhavanti kīrtayaḥ prabhāvamāhātmyamiti śritaṃ guṇān //	Virtues are visited even by such bliss as attends the Lord of the Devas; the virtuous alone attain humility; virtues alone are the sources of glory; it is on them that the magnificence of sovereignty rests.
amarṣadarpodbhavakarkaśānyapi prarūḍhavairasthiramatsarāṇyapi / prasādayantyeva manāṃsi vidviṣāṃ śaśiprakāśādhikakāntayo guṇāḥ // tadevameva kṣitipāla pālayan mahīṃ pratāpānatadṛptapārthivām / amandaśobhairvinayādibhirguṇairguṇānurāgaṃ jagatāṃ prabodhaya //	Virtues alone, possessing greater loveliness than moonshine, are able to appease enemies, be their mind never so ferocious by indulgence in jealous anger and pride, be their selfishness never so deep-rooted by a long continuance of hatred. For this reason, sovereign, whose rule earth obeys with its proud kings who bow to thy lustre, foster the love of virtues in thy people, setting them an example by the undiminished splendour of thy modesty and the rest of thy virtues.
prajāhitaṃ kṛtyatamaṃ mahīpatestadasya panthā hyubhayatra bhūtaye / bhavecca tadrājani dharmavatsale nṛpasya vṛttaṃ hi jano 'nuvartate // praśādhi dharmeṇa vasuṃdharāmataḥ karotu rakṣāṃ tridaśādhipaśca te /	And this end will be attained, if the king loves righteousness; for people like to follow the conduct of their ruler.. Mayst thou, then, rule thy land with righteousness, and may the Lord of the Celestials have thee in his guard! But though thy presence purifies those who rest on thee, yet must leave thee now.
tvadantikātsaṃśritabhāvanādapi svayūthyaduḥkhaṃ tu vikarṣatīva mām //	The sorrow of my fellow-swans draws me to them, so to speak. Or perhaps: tends to the happiness of both (his subjects and himself).
atha sa rājā samabhinandya tattasya vacanaṃ saparṣatkaḥ saṃmānapriyavacanaprayogapuraḥsara tau haṃsamukhyau visasarja /	Then he dismissed both excellent swans in the most honourable and kind terms.

And those, by the very sight of him, were filled with the utmost gladness.
kālena copetya nṛpaṃ sa haṃsaḥ parānukampāvyasanī sahaṃsaḥ / jagāda dharmaṃ kṣitipena tena pratyarcyamāno vinayānatena //	And after some time that swan, a passionate lover as he was of compassion for his neighbour, came back to the king with his swans, and discoursed to him on the Law of Righteousness. And the king with respectfully bowed head in return honoured him.

[This story is also to be adduced when praising pious language: In this manner a pious language conduces to the good of both. Likewise, when treating of pious friends: In this manner they who possess a pious friend will be successful even in dangerous circumstances. the speaker and the listener..

Such is their gratitude, and to this extent have they imbibed the virtue of forbearance. This will be taught as follows. In the time when the Lord was a Bodhisattva, he was a wandering ascetic, it is said, named Mahabodhi. When still a householder, he had made a regular and thorough study of such branches of learning as are esteemed in the world, and being curious of fine arts, had also acquainted himself with them.

guṇā hi puṇyāśrayalabdhadīptayo gatāḥ priyatvaṃ pratipattiśobhayā / api dviṣadbhyaḥ svayaśonurakṣayā bhavanti satkāraviśeṣabhāginaḥ //	Virtues acquire splendour by their appearing on the ground of meritorious actions, but it is by the gracefulness of their practice, that they will gain the affection of men and partake of the most distinguished worship even from the side of one's enemies, obliged to do so by regard for their own reputation.

Having been informed of it long before, he had a dwelling-place built for him in a lovely spot in his own pleasure-gardens.

And the Bodhisattva for his part favoured him with daily discourses on religious subjects, delightful to both the ears and the heart, by which he gradually prepared him to walk on the road to salvation.

ka eva vādaḥ śucibhājanopame hitārthini premaguṇotsuke jane // atha tasya rājño 'mātyā labdhavidvatsaṃbhāvanā labdhasaṃmānāśca sadasyāḥ pratyahamabhivardhamānasatkārāṃ bodhisattvasya guṇasamṛddhimīrṣyopahatabuddhitvānna sehire /	How should they not teach him who, like a pure vessel, is eager to accept their instruction and to manifest his love? But the ministers of that king, though receiving the honour due to their learning, and his counsellors, though also treated with respect, could not bear the constantly increasing honour paid to the magnificence of the Bodhisattva's virtues.
svaguṇātiśayoditairyaśobhirjagadāvarjanadṛṣṭaśaktiyogaḥ / racanāguṇamātrasatkṛteṣu jvalayatyeva pareṣvamarṣavahnim //	The glory and renown of a man who shows his ability to fascinate mankind by the superiority of his virtues, suffices to kindle the fire of envious feeling in those who are honoured only on account of their professional skill.
prasahya cainaṃ śāstrakathasvabhibhavitumaśaktā dharmaprasaṅgamamṛṣyamāṇāśca rājñastena tena krameṇa rājānaṃ bodhisattvaṃ prati vigrahayāmāsuḥ-nārhati devo bodhiparivrājake viśvāsamupagantum /	They were unable to vanquish him in open contest in disputes on topics of the law-books, and at the same time were sorry to see the king's constant attachment to the Law of Righteousness. Then, in order to rouse his disaffection towards the Bodhisattva, they proceeded almost in this manner. Your Majesty, so would they say, should not put his confidence in that wandering monk Bodhi.
vyaktamayaṃ devasya guṇapriyatāṃ dharmābhimukhatāṃ copalabhya vyasanapratāraṇaślakṣṇaśaṭhamadhuravacanaḥ pravṛttisaṃcāraṇahetubhūtaḥ kasyāpi pratyarthino rājño nipuṇaḥ praṇidhiprayogaḥ / tathā hi dharmātmako nāma bhūtvā devamekāntena kāruṇyapravṛttau hrīdainye ca samanuśāsti, arthakāmo parodhiṣu ca kṣatradharmabāhyeṣvāsannāpanayeṣu dharmasamādāneṣu dayānuvṛttyā ca nāma te kṛtyapakṣamāśvāsanavidhinopagṛṇīte priyasaṃstavaścānyarājadūtaiḥ /	It is evident that he must be a kind of spy of some rival king, who having learnt Your Majesty's love of virtues and inclination towards Righteousness, avails himself of this clever fellow with his soft, smooth, and deceitful tongue, to entice you into baleful habits and to be informed of your actions. For this devotee of Righteousness as he pretends to be, instructing Your Majesty exclusively to practise compassionateness and to foster the miserable feeling of shame, induces you to take upon yourself such vows of a religious life as are incompatible with your royal, and military duties, prejudicial to the promotion of material interests (artha) and pleasures (kāma), and subject to the dangers attending a.
na cāyamaviditavṛttānto rājaśāstrāṇām /	Indeed, it is out of pure charity that, in the way of exhorting you, he suggests the line of conduct you should follow; nevertheless, he likes to converse with the messengers of other kings, and is far from being a stranger to the contents of the manuals of political wisdom which treat of the duties of kings.
ataḥ sāśaṅkānyatra no hṛdayānīti / atha tasya rājñaḥ punaḥ punarbhedopasaṃhitaṃ hitamiva bahubhirucyamānasya bodhisattvaṃ prati pariśaṅkāsaṃkocitasnehagauravaprasaramanyādṛśaṃ cittamabhavat /	Accordingly this matter fills our hearts with apprehension. Such language spoken with the intention of causing estrangement, being often repeated and by many who feigned to have in view the good of the king, could not fail to have its effect. His attachment and veneration for the Bodhisattva shrunk under the influence of his distrust, and his disposition towards him became changed.
paiśunyavajrāśanisaṃnipāte bhīmasvane cāśanisaṃnipāte / visrambhavan mānuṣamātradhairyaḥ syānnirvikāro yadi nāma kaścit // atha sa rājā visrambhavirahānmandībhūtapremabahumānastasmin mahāsattve na yathāpūrvaṃ satkāraprayogasumukho babhūva /	Whether a succession of loud-roaring tremendous thunderbolts or of those other thunderbolts, whose name is calumny pierce the ears of men, does there exist anybody who can remain unshaken by them, trustful and firm in the confidence of his own power? Now, as the absence of trust lessened the king's affection and veneration for the Great Being, the king was no more, as before, careful to pay him due honour.
bodhisattvo 'pi śuddhasvabhāvatvāt bahukāryavyāsaṅgā rājāna iti na tanmanasi cakāra /	But the Bodhisattva, owing to his pure heartedness, did not mind it; kings are distracted by many occu pations, so he thought.
tatsamīpavartināṃ tu vinayopacāraśaithilyasaṃdarśanādviraktahṛdayamavetya rājānaṃ samādāya tridaṇḍakuṇḍikādyāṃ parivrājakabhāṇḍikāṃ prakramaṇasavyāpāraḥ samabhavat / tadupaśrutya sa rājā sāvaśeṣasnehatayā dākṣiṇyavinayānuvṛttyā cainamabhigamya pradarśitasaṃbhramo vinivartayitukāma iva tamuvāca-	Still, when he perceived the coolness and lack of attention from the side of the courtiers, he understood that he had incurred the king's displeasure, and taking his triple staff, his waterpot and the other utensils of a wandering ascetic, made preparations for his departure. The king, hearing his resolution, as he was partly moved by a remnant of his old affection, partly would not neglect an act of politeness and civility, went up to him, and in order to show his trouble and pretended desire to retain him, said.
asmānakasmādapahāya kasmādgantavya eva praṇatā matiste / vyalīkaśāṅkajanakaṃ nu kiṃcid dṛṣṭaṃ pramādaskhalitaṃ tvayā naḥ // athainaṃ bodhisattva uvāca-	For what reason are you determined to go away, leaving us all of a sudden? Have you perhaps to complain of some lack of attention on our part, which has roused your fears? If this is the case, you suspect us without reason, it must have been an omission. The Bodhisattva replied:.
nākasmiko 'yaṃ gamanodyamo me nāsatkriyāmātrakarūkṣikatvāt / abhājanatvaṃ tu gato 'si śāṭhyāddharmasya tenāhamito vrajāmi // athāsya sarabhasabhaṣitamativivṛtavadanamabhidravantaṃ vallabhaṃ śvānaṃ tatrāgatamabhipradarśayan punaruvāca-ayaṃ cātra mahārāja amānuṣaḥ sākṣinirdeśo dṛśyatām /	My departure has a good reason. Not that so trifling a matter as ill-treatment has irritated me, but because you have ceased to be a vessel of righteousness in consequence of your deceitful behaviour, for this reason set out from hence. At this moment the king's favourite dog came running to the Bodhisattva in a hostile manner and barked at him with wide-opened mouth. Pointing at this dog, he said again: Why, let this animal bear witness to the case, Your Majesty.
ayaṃ hi pūrvaṃ paṭucāṭukasrmā bhūtvā mayi śvā bhavato 'nuvṛttyā /	Formerly this dog was accustomed to fondle me; then he was imitating your example.
ākāraguptyajñatayās tvidānīṃ tvadbhāvasūcāṃ bhaṣitaiḥ karoti //	But now he betrays your feelings by his barks, for he does not know how to feign.
tvattaḥ śrutaṃ kiṃcidanena nūnaṃ madantare bhaktivipattirūkṣam / ato 'nuvṛttaṃ dhruvmityanena tvatprītihetoranujīvivṛttam //	Surely, he must have heard from you harsh words on my account, as will happen when former affection has been destroyed; and now, forsooth, he is acting up to them, that he may please you; for such is the behaviour of servants who eat the bread of their lord. This reproof filled the king with shame, and made him cast down his eyes.
atha sa rājā tatpratyādeśādvrīḍāvanāmitavdanastena cāsy matiaipuṇyena samāvarjitamatirjātsaṃvego nedānīṃ śāṭhyānuvṛttikāla iti bodhisattvamabhipraṇamyovāca-	The acuteness of mind of the Bodhisattva touched him and moved his heart. He thought it was not proper to continue his false protestations of love, and bowing reverentially to him, spoke.
tvadāśrayā kācidabhūtkathaiṣā saṃprastutā naḥ sadasi pragalbhaiḥ /	You were indeed the subject of such conversation as you said.
upekṣitā kāryavaśānmayā ca tatkṣamyatāṃ tiṣṭha ca sādhu mā gāḥ //	Audacious people used that language in my council, and, absorbed in business, overlooked the matter. You must forgive me, then, and stay here.
bodhisattva uvāca-naiva khalvahaṃ mahārāja asatkāraprakṛtatvādakṣamayā vā praṇudyamāno gacchāmi /	Pray, do not go. The Bodhisattva said: Surely, it is not on account of ill-treatment that want to go, Your Majesty, nor am driven out by resentment.
na tvayaṃ mahārāja avasthānakāla iti na tiṣṭhāmi /	But considering it is now no proper time to stay here, Your Majesty, for this reason go.
paśyatu bhavān /	Do but take this in view.
vimadhyabhāvādapi hīnaśobhe yāyāṃ na satkāravidhau svayaṃ cet / saṅgādagatyā jaḍatābalādvā nanvardhacandrābhinayottaraḥ syām //	If, either by attachment or from apathy, should not go of my own accord now, as needs must, after the honourable hospitality shown to me has lost its beauty, having become an ordinary one, verily, would it not hereafter come to the point that should be seized by the neck and turned out?.
prāptakramo 'yaṃ vidhiratra tena yāsyāmi nāprītyabhitaptacittaḥ /	Not with a heart sore with hatred am about to leave you, but considering this the proper course to follow now.
ekāvamānābhihatā hi satsu pūrvopakārā na samībhavanti //	Former benefits are not effaced from the heart of the pious by the stroke of one affront.
asnigdhabhāvastu na paryupāsyastoyārthinā śuṣka ivodapānaḥ /	But an ill-disposed man is not fit to be had for a patron, no more than a dried-up pond will serve him who is in want of water.
prayatnasādhyāpi tator 'thasiddhiryasmādbhavedākaluṣā kṛśā ca //	If profit may be gained from the side of such a one, it requires much care to acquire it, and the result will be meagre and not unmixed.
prasanna eva tvabhigamyarūpaḥ śaradviśuddhāmbumahāhradābhaḥ / sukhārthinaḥ kleśaparāṅmukhasya lokaprasiddhaḥ sphuṭa eṣa mārgaḥ //	He, however, who desires ease and dislikes trouble, must attend only on such a patron who has composed his mind and by his placidity resembles a great lake of pure water in autumn. So is the well-known line of conduct approved of men..
bhaktyunmukhādyo 'pi parāṅmukha syātparāṅmukhe cābhimukhatvadīnaḥ / pūrvopakārasmaraṇālaso va narākṛtiścintyaviniścayaḥ saḥ //	Further, he who is averse to one intent on showing his attachment; likewise he who, attending on somebody who dislikes him, afflicts himself; thirdly, he who is slow in remembering former benefits such persons bear only the shape of a man and raise doubts as to their real nature.
asevanā cātyupasevanā ca yācñābhiyogāśca dahanti maitrīm /	Friendship is destroyed both by lack of intercourse and profusion of attentions, also by frequent requests.
rakṣyaṃ yataḥ prītyavaśeṣametannivāsadoṣāditi yāmi tāvat // rājovāca-yadyavaśyameva gantavyamiti niścitātrabhavato matiḥ, tatpunarapīdānīmihāgamanenāsmānanugrahītumarhati bhavān /	can only express my wish to see you another time, when there may be some indispensable reason for coming. Having in this way appeased the king, who dismissed him in the most honourable manner, he set off from his realm, and feeling his mind troubled by intercourse with people living in the world, took up his abode in some forest-place.
sa tena gṛhijanasaṃstavenākulitahṛdayo 'nyatamadaraṇyāyatanamupaśritya dhyānābhiyuktamatistatra viharannacireṇaiva catvāri dhyānāni pañcābhijñāḥ pratilebhe //	Staying there, he directed his mind to the exercise of meditation and before long came to the possession of the four ecstatic trances (dhyāna) and the five kinds of transcendent knowledge (abhijñā)..
tasya samāsvāditapraśamasukharasasya smṛtiranukampānusāriṇī taṃ rājānaṃ prati prādurabhūt-kā nu khalu tasya rājño 'vastheti /	And, as he was concerned about the present state of that prince, he directed his thoughts towards him, and saw that his ministers were each enticing him to the tenets of the (false) doctrine which he professed.
athainaṃ ddarśa tairamātyairyathabhiniviṣṭāni dṛṣṭigatāni prati pratāryamāṇam / kaścidenamamātyo durvibhāvyahetubhirnidarśanairahetuvādaṃ prati pracakarṣa-	One among them endeavoured to win him for the doctrine according to which there should be no causality, taking for examples such instances, where it is difficult to demonstrate causality.
kaḥ padmanāladalakesarakarṇikānāṃ saṃsthānavarṇaracanāmṛdutadihetuḥ / patrāṇi citrayati ko 'tra patatriṇāṃ vā svābhāvikaṃ jagadidaṃ niyataṃ tathaiva //	What, said he, is the cause of the shape, the colour, the arrangement the softness and so on of the stalks, the petals, the filaments and the pericarps of the lotuses? Who diversifies the feathers of the birds in this world? In just the same manner this whole universe is the product of the work of essential and inherent properties, to be sure.
apara īśvarakāraṇamasmai svabuddhirucitamupavarṇayāmāsa-	Another, who held a Supreme Being (Iśvara) for the first cause, expounded him the tenets of his lore.
nākasmikaṃ bhavitumarhati sarvametadastyatra sarvamadhi kaścidananta ekaḥ /	It is not probable that this universe should exist without a cause. There is some being who rules it, Eternal and One.
svecchāviśeṣaniyamādya imaṃ vicitraṃ lokaṃ karoti ca punaśca samīkaroti // sarvamidaṃ pūrvakarmakṛtaṃ sukhāsukham / na prayatnasāmarthyamastītyevamanya enaṃ vigrāhayāmāsa-	It is He who in consequence of the fixation of His mind on His transcendental volition, creates the world and again dissolves it. Another, on the contrary, deceived him by this doctrine: This universe is the result of former actions, which are the cause of fortune, good and ill; personal energy has no effect at all to modify it.
evaṃ kariṣyati kathaṃ nu samānakālaṃ bhinnāśrayān bahuvidhānamitāṃśca bhāvān / sarvaṃ tu pūrvakṛtakarmanimittametat	How, indeed, may one being create at the same time the manifold and boundless variety of the different substances and properties? No, this universe is the product of former actions.
saukhyaprayatnanipuṇo 'hi hi duḥkhameti // apara ucchedavādakathābhirenaṃ kāmabhogaprasaṅga eva pratārayāmāsa-	For even he who is skilled in striving for his happiness comes into mishap. Another again enticed him to be solely attached to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, by means of such reasoning as is heard from the adherents of the doctrine of annihilation.
dāruṇi naikavidhavarṇaguṇākṛtīni karmātmakāni na bhavanti bhavanti caiva /	Pieces of wood, differing in colour, properties, and shape, cannot be said to exist as the result of actions, and yet they exist, and once perished they do not grow up again.
naṣṭāni naiva ca yathā punarudbhavanti lokastathāyamiti saukhyaparāyaṇaḥ syāt // apara enaṃ kṣatravidyāparidṛṣṭeṣu nītikauṭilyaprasaṅgeṣu nairghṛṇyamalineṣu dharmavirodhiṣvapi rājadharmo 'yamiti sanamuśaśāsa-	Something similar is to be said of this world. For this reason one must consider pleasures the main object of life. Another, pretending to instruct him in his royal duties, recommended to him such practices as are taught in the science of the Kṣatriyas, and which, following the winding paths of political wisdom (nīti), are soiled by cruelty and contrary to righteousness (dharma).
chāyādrumeṣviva nareṣu kṛtāśrayeṣu	You must avail yourself of men, as of shady trees, considering them fit objects to resort to.
tāvatkṛtajñacaritaiḥ svayaśaḥ parīpset / nārtho 'sti yāvadupabhoganayena teṣāṃ	Accordingly, endeavour to extend your glory by showing them gratitude, only as long, until your policy ceases to want their use.
kṛtye tu yajña iva te paśavo niyojyāḥ // iti te 'mātyāstaṃ rājānaṃ tena tena dṛṣṭikṛtonmārgeṇa netumīṣuḥ //	They are to be appointed to their task in the manner of victims destined for the sacrifice. So those ministers desired to lead the king astray, each on the path of his own false doctrines..
guṇābhyāsena sādhūnāṃ kṛtaṃ tiṣṭhasi cetasi / bhraśyatyapakṛtaṃ tasmājjalaṃ padmadalādiva //	The pious, in consequence of their constant practice of virtues, retain in their mind the good done to them, whereas the evil they experienced drops from their mind, like water from a lotus-petal.
atha bodhisattva idamatra prāptakālamiti viniścitya svasminnāśramapade mahāntaṃ vānaramabhinirmāya ṛddhiprabhāvāttasya carmāpanīya śeṣamantardhāpayāmāsa / sa tannirmitaṃ mahadvānaracarmabibhrattasya nṛpaterbhavanadvāre prādurabhūt /	Having taken his resolution as to the proper thing to be done in the case, he created in his own hermitage, by dint of magic, a large monkey, whose skin he stripped off, making the rest of his body disappear. Wearing that skin, created by himself he presented himself at the entrance-gate of the king's palace. After being ushered in by the doorkeepers, he was admitted to the royal presence.

ayaṃ ca mayāśramapade mahān vānaro dṛṣṭaḥ /	The monarch went to meet him, and showed him every honour and respect due to a guest.
sa ca praśamita iti / tacchrutvā sa rājā dākṣiṇyavinayānuvṛttyā na bodhisattvaṃ kiṃcitpratyuvāca /	After the usual exchange of compliments and kind reception, when the Bodhisattva had taken the seat offered to him, the king, who was curious about that monkey-skin, asked him how he got it, saying.
āśramapadamabhigata eva mahānnāma vānara ekākinā tapaḥkṣāmaśarīreṇa praśamita ityāścaryam /	While sitting or sleeping on the hard ground strewed only with thin straw, the body suffers, and the religious duties cannot be performed at ease.
athainānasaṃrabdha eva bodhisattvaḥ pratyuvāca-nārhantyatrabhavantaḥ svavādaśobhānirapekṣamityasmān vigarhitum /	When asking after their health, it is similarly said: is your penance successful?.
na hyayaṃ kramo vidvadyaśaḥ samudbhāvayitum /	This is not the way by which to make the glory of learning shine.
paśyantvatrabhavantaḥ-	Your honours must consider this.
svavādaghnena vacasā yaḥ parān vijugupsate / sa khalvātmavadheneva parasyākīrtimicchati // iti sa mahātmā tānamātyān sāmānyenopālabhya pratyekaśaḥ punarupālabdhukāmastamahetuvādinamāmantryovāca-	He who despises his adversaries with such words as are destructive to his own doctrine, such a one, so to speak, wishes the dishonour of his enemy at the cost of his own life. After thus reproaching those ministers collectively, the Great Being, wishing to revile them once more individually, addressed that minister who denied causality in these terms:.
svābhāvikaṃ jagaditi pravikatthase tvaṃ	You profess that this universe is the product of essential and inherent properties.
tattvam ca tadyadi vikutsayase kimasmān / śākhāmṛge nidhanamāpatite svabhāvā- tpāpaṃ kuto mama yataḥ suhato mayāyam // atha pāpamasti mama tasya vadhānnanu hetutastaditi siddhamidam /	Now, if this be true, why do you blame me? What fault is mine, if this ape died in consequence of his nature? Therefore, have rightly killed him. If, however, committed a sin by killing him, it is evident that his death is produced by an (external) cause.
tadahetuvādamidamutsṛja vā vada vātra yattava na yuktamiva //	This being so, you must either renounce your doctrine of non-causality or use here such reasoning as does not befit you.
yadi padmanālaracanādi ca yattadahetukaṃ nanu sadaiva bhavet / salilādibījakṛtameva tu tat sati tatra saṃbhavati na hyasati //	Further, if the arrangement, colour and so on of the stalks, petals and so on of lotuses were not the effect of some cause, would they not be found always and everywhere? But this is not so, they are produced from seeds being in water and so on; where this condition is found, they appear, not where it is not found.
api cāyuṣman, samyagupadhāraya tāvat /	This, too, would propound to Your Worship, to consider it well.
na heturastīti vadan sahetukaṃ nanu pratijñāṃ svayameva hāpayet / athāpi hetupraṇayālaso bhavet pratijñayā kevalayāsya kiṃ bhavet //	He who denies the agency of cause by means of reasoning with arguments, does not such a one desert his own tenets? On the other hand, if he is averse to the use of argument, say, what will he do with his sole tenet (not supported by argument)?.
ekatra kvacidanavekṣya yaśca hetuṃ tenaiva pravadati sarvahetuvabhāvam / pratyakṣaṃ nanu tadavetya hetusāraṃ taddveṣī bhavati virodhaduṣṭavākyaḥ //	And he who, not perceiving the cause in some particular case, proclaims for this very reason, that there does not exist causality at all, will not such a one, when he learns the manifest power of causality in that case, grow angry at it and oppose it with invectives?.
na lakṣyate yadi kuhacicca kāraṇaṃ kathaṃ nu taddṛḍhamasadeva bhāṣase / na dṛśyate sadapi hi kārṇāntarāddinātyaye vimalamivārkamaṇḍalam //	And if somewhere the cause is latent, why do you say with assurance, it does not exist? Though it is, it is not perceived for some other cause, as for instance the white colour of the sun's disc is not seen at sunset.
nanu ca bhoḥ /	Moreover, sir,.
sukhārthamiṣṭān viṣayān prapadyase niṣevituṃ nicchasi tadvirodhinaḥ /	For the sake of happiness you pursue the objects you desire, and will not follow such things as are opposed to it.
nṛpasya sevāṃ ca karoṣi tatkṛte na heturastīti ca nāma bhāṣase //	And it is for the same purpose that you attend on the king. And notwithstanding this, you dare deny causality!.
tadevamapi cedbhāvānanupaśyasyahetukān /	Moreover, the word hetu the Bodhisattva employs here means both cause and reason..
iti sa mahātmā tamahetuvādinaṃ viśadairhetubhirniṣpratibhaṃ kṛtvā tamīśvarakāraṇikamāmantryovāca-āyuṣmānapyasmān nārhatyeva vigarhitum /	Then addressing himself to the believer in a Supreme Being, he said: You, too, never ought to blame me, noble sir.
īśvaraḥ sarvasya hi te kāraṇamabhimataḥ /	According to your doctrine, the Lord is the cause of everything.
kurute yadi sarvamīśvaro nanu tenaiva hataḥ sa vānaraḥ / tava keyamamaitracittatā paradoṣān mayi yanniṣiñcasi // atha vānaravīravaiśasaṃ na kṛtaṃ tena dayānurodhinā / bṛhadityavaghuṣyate kathaṃ jagataḥ kāraṇamīśvarastvayā // api ca bhadra sarvamīśvarakṛtamiti paśyataḥ-	If the Lord does everything, He alone is the killer of that ape, is He not? How can you bear such unfriendliness in your heart as to throw blame on me on account of the fault of another? If, however, you do not ascribe the murder of that valiant monkey to Him because of His compassionateness, how is it that you loudly proclaim, the Lord is the cause of this Universe? Moreover, friend, believing, as you do, that everything is done by the Lord,.
īśvare prasādāśā kā stutipraṇāmādyaiḥ / sa svayaṃ svayaṃbhūste yatkaroti tatkarma //	What hope have you of propitiating the Lord by praise, supplication, and the like? For the Self-born Being works those actions of yours himself.
tvatkṛtātha yadījyā na tvasau tadakartā /	If, however, you say, the sacrifice is performed by yourself, still you cannot disavow that He is the author of it.
ātmano hi vibhūtyā yaḥ karoti sa kartā //	He who is self-acting out of the fullness of His power, is the author of a deed, no other.
īśvaraḥ kurute cetpātakānyakhilāni / tatra bhaktiniveśaḥ kaṃ guṇaṃ nu samīkṣya // tānyadharmabhayādvā yadyayaṃ na karoti / tena vaktumayuktaṃ sarvamīśvarasṛṣṭam //	Again, if the Lord is the performer of all sins, however many there are committed, what virtue of His have you in view that you should foster devotion to Him? On the other hand, if it is not He who commits them, since He abhors wickedness, it is not right to say that everything is created by the Lord.
tasya ceśvaratā syāddharmataḥ parato vā /	Further, the sovereignty of the Lord must rest either on the lawful order of things (Dharma) or on something else.
dharmato yadi na prāgīśvaraḥ sa tato 'bhūt //	If on the former, then the Lord cannot have existed before the Dharma.
dāsataiva ca sā syādyā kriyeta pareṇa / syādathāpi na hetoḥ kasya neśvaratā syāt // evamapi u gate bhaktirāgādavigaṇitayuktāyuktasya-	If effected by some external cause, it should rather be called bondage for if a state of dependency should not bear that name, what state may not be called 'sovereignty? Nevertheless, if in spite of this reasoning, attached to the doctrine of Devotion and without having well reflected on its probability or improbability,.
yadi kāraṇamīśvara eva vibhūrjagato nikhilasya tavābhimataḥ / nanu nārhasi mayyadhiropayituṃ vihitaṃ vibhunā kapirājavadham //	You persist in holding the Supreme Being and Lord for the sole cause of the whole universe, does it, then, become you to impute to me the murder of that chief of monkeys, which has been decided by the Supreme Being? The belief in a Supreme Being, Lord (īśvara), is in itself of course also a belief in the strong effectiveness of devotion (bhakti)..
iti sa mahātmā tamī"varakāraṇikaṃ suśliṣṭairhetubhirmūkatāmivopanīya taṃ pūrvakarmakṛtavādinamamantraṇāsauṣṭhavenābhimukhīkṛtyovāca-bhavānapyasmānna śobhate vikutsayamānasḥ /	And turning to that minister who was a partisan of the doctrine of former actions, he addressed him in a very skilful manner, saying: No more does it become you, too, to censure me.
sarvaṃ hi ta pūrvakarmakṛtamityabhimānaḥ /	According to your opinion, everything is the consequence of former actions.
tena ca tvāṃ bravīmi-	For this reason, tell you,.
syātsarvameva yadi pūrvakṛtaprabhāvā- cchākhāmṛgaḥ suhata eva mayaiṣa tasmāt /	If everything ought to be imputed exclusively to the power of former actions, then this monkey has been rightly killed by me.
dagdhe hi pūrvakṛtakarmadavāgnināsmin	He has been burnt by the wild fire of his former actions.
pāpaṃ kimatra mama yena vigarhase mām //	What fault of mine is to be found here that you should blame me?.
athāsti pāpaṃ mama vānaraṃ ghnataḥ kṛtaṃ mayā tarhi na pūrvakarmaṇā /	On the other hand, suppose did a bad action in killing the ape, must be the cause of his death, not his former actions.

If, nevertheless, you persist in your doctrine of the former actions, for what reason do you judge me to have caused the death of that ape? In this manner the High-minded One, expounding irrefutable arguments, put him to silence so that it seemed as if he had made him take the vow of silence. Next he said smilingly to that minister who was an adherent of the doctrine of annihilation: How extremely eager your honour is to blame me, if at least you really are a partisan of the doctrine of annihilation.
lokaḥ paro yadi na kaścana kiṃ vivarjyaṃ pāpaṃ śubhaṃ prati ca kiṃ bahumānamohaḥ / svacchandaramyacarito 'tra vicakṣaṇaḥ syā-	If there does not exist anything like a future existence after death, why should we avoid evil actions, and what have we to do with the folly of holding good actions in esteem? He alone would be wise who behaves according to impulse, as he likes best.

If, notwithstanding this, you persist in your attachment to the doctrine of annihilation, what reason is it that you should censure the murderer of a monkey or a man? So the Great Being silenced that adherent of annihilation by means of a refutation of conspicuous elegance. Then he addressed that minister who was so skilled in the science of princes. For what reason, he said, do you also censure me, if you really consider the line of conduct as taught in the love of political science to be the right one?.

On the other hand, if such a deed is to be blamed for its cruelty, and is certain to have evil consequences, by what means do you resort to a lore which does not acknowledge this?.

Oh! the audacious who, despising mankind, propound injustice by the way of authoritative law-books!.

Well, it is not who should be blamed on account of the death of that ape, since followed the path of that policy which is taught in your books. In this manner, then, the High-minded One vanquished by a strong assault those ministers in spite of their influence on the bystanders, in spite also of their habitual boldness. And when he understood he had won over the assembly with the king, wishing to expel from their The Pāli recension expresses this by the drastic utterance: the would-be wise advocates of the khattavijjā say you may kill your father or mother or eldest brother, yea your children and wife, if such be your interest. follow the emendation of the editor mukhena, not the senseless reading of the.

So speaking, he dissolved the illusion (of the ape-skin) he had produced by magic. Then, seeing that the king and his assembly were now in apt state of mind to be converted, he said:.

This tree had its roots on the border of the sloping bank of a waterfall, and hung down its branches, loaded with very ripe fruits which gave them a tawny hue at their ends. Craving for those fruits, the man mounted to that slope, and climbing up the tinduka-tree, reached a branch with fruit overhanging the precipice. And his eagerness to get the fruit induced him to go along it to its very end.

But when the Great Being, in consequence of his fatigue, had fallen asleep, he conceived wicked thoughts within his mind.

And how shall succeed in traversing this wilderness hard to pass, if am infirm? Yet, in the body of this ape should have food amply sufficient to get out of this troublesome wilderness. Although he has done good to me, may feed on him, may, for he has been created such a being.

Having thus made up his mind, that scoundrel, troubled in his thoughts by sinful lust which had destroyed within him his gratitude, his consciousness of the moral precepts, and even his tender innate feeling of compassion, not minding his great weakness of body, and listening only to his extreme desire to perform that vile action, took a stone, and made it fall straight down on the head of the great ape.

He did not become angry, nor was he subdued by the sinful feeling of wrath. He was rather affected with compassion for him who, disregarding his own happiness, had committed that exceedingly vile deed. Looking at him with eyes wet with tears, he lamented over the man, saying:,.

So commiserating that man, the High-minded One conducted him to the border of the inhabited region, and having put him on his way, said again.
prāpto janāntamasi kānta vanāntameta- tkāntāradurgabhayamutsṛja gaccha sādhu /	Thou hast reached the habitations of men, friend; now thou mayst leave this forest-region with its fearful thickets and wildernesses.

So the great ape pitying the man, instructed him as if he were his disciple; after which he went back to his abode in the forest.

His figure became changed, his skin was spotted with vesicles which, becoming ulcers and bursting, wetted his body with their matter, and made it putrid in a high degree.

And people, thinking him to be the embodied Devil, drove him away, threatening him with uplifted clods and clubs and harsh words of menace.

On perceiving his most horrible appearance for he looked like a Preta, the dirty remains of his garments having at last dropped off, so that he had hardly enough to cover his shame that king, affected with curiosity mingled with fear, asked him thus: See supra, note on p.

Art thou a Preta, or a goblin, or the embodied Devil, or a Pūtana? Or if one out of the number of sicknesses, which art thou who displayest the assemblage of many diseases? Upon which the other, bowing to the prince, answered in a faltering tone: am a man, great king, not a spirit. And being asked again by the king, how he had come into that state, he confessed to him his wicked deed, and added these words:.
mitradrohasya tasyedaṃ puṣpaṃ tāvadupasthitam /	This suffering here is only the blossom of the tree sown by that treacherous deed against my friend.
ataḥ kaṣṭataraṃ vyaktaṃ phalamanyadbhaviṣyati //	, surely, its fruit will be still more miserable than this.

From hence you may infer what will be in the other world the fate of those who, sullied in their mind by covetousness and other vices, attempted the life of their friends.

Thus knowing the power and the consequences of good and evil behaviour with respect to friends, king, hold fast to the road followed by the virtuous.

That region, lying beyond the path and the noise of men, was a dwelling-place of manifold tribes of forest-animals. Its many roots, trees, and shrubs were immersed in the thick and high grass which covered its soil, untrodden by travellers and showing nowhere any trace of vehicles and carriages, the tracks of whose feet or wheels might have beaten something like a road or border-line; yet, it was intersected with channels and full of ant-hills and holes.

Possessing the virtue of contentment, he subsisted only on grasses, leaves and water, and was pleased with his residence in the forest. So he adorned that part of the forest, longing, like a Yogin, for complete detachment.
mṛgākṛtirmānuṣadhīracetāstapasvivatprāṇiṣu sānukampaḥ /	Bearing the shape of a forest-animal, but possessing the intellectual faculties of a man, he lived in that solitary.

Mounted on his excellent horse, holding his bent bow and arrow in his hand, and being eager to try his skill of arms on the game, he was pursuing the deer with speed, indulging in the excitement (of the chase). So he was carried away by his horse, an animal of extraordinary swiftness, and separated by no small distance from his retinue, a body of elephants, horse, chariots, and footmen.
dūrādeva cālokya taṃ mahāsattvaṃ hantumutpatitaniścayaḥ samutkṛṣṭaniśitasāyako yataḥ sa mahātmā tena turagavaraṃ saṃcodayāmāsa /	As soon as he saw the Great Being from afar, he was resolved on killing him, and keeping ready his bow strung with a sharp arrow, spurred his horse to chase the High-minded One.

so 'nugamyamānastena turaṃgameṇānumārgāgataṃ mahacchvabhraṃ goṣpadamiva javena laṅghayitvā pradudrāva /	While being pursued by the king, meeting with a large hole on his way, he quickly jumped over it, as if it were a small puddle, and continued his flight.
atha turagavarastenaiva mārgeṇa taṃ śarabhamanupatannuttamena javapramāṇena tacchvabhramāsādya laṅghayitumanadhyavasitamatiḥ sahasā vyatiṣṭhata /	When the excellent horse, running after the śarabha in the same direction as swiftly as ever he could, arrived at that hole, he hesitated to risk the leap, and of a sudden stood still.
athāśvapṛṣṭhādudgīrṇaḥ sāyudhaḥ sa mahīpatiḥ / papāta mahati śvabhre daityayodha ivodadhau //	Then the king, as he was, his bow in his hands, tumbled down from horseback and fell headlong into the large hole, as a warrior of the Daityas sinks into the Ocean.
nibaddhacakṣuḥ śarabhe sa tasmin saṃlakṣayāmāsa na taṃ prapātam /	Keeping his eyes fixed on the śarabha, he had not noticed that chasm.
visrambhadoṣāccalitāsano 'tha drutāśvavegoparamātpapāta //	So he fell by the fault of his want of circumspection, as he lost his balance by the sudden stopping of his horse from his great swiftness.

Then, turning his head and looking behind, he saw the horse without his rider standing on the brink of that chasm.
tasya buddhirabhavat-niyatamatra prapāte nipatitaḥ sa rājā /	On perceiving this, his thoughts turned to this reasoning: No doubt, the king must have fallen into this chasm.

na caiva vyālamṛgānuvicaritamaraṇyavanamavagāḍhena yatra kvacidupasṛjya turagavaraṃ viśramyate mṛgayā vānuṣṭhīyate /	Nor, since he entered this wild forest-region haunted by ferocious animals, is he likely to have dismounted and left his excellent horse in some place, that he might either take his rest or continue hunting alone.

After he had convinced himself of this, the High-minded One felt the utmost commiseration for him who sought his life.

His army attended him, a mixed host of chariots, horsemen, footmen, and elephants, adorned with gay banners, glittering in their armour and weapons, and marching to the brisk tones of music..
adyaiva magno mahati prapāte nipātavegādabirugṇagātraḥ /	And now at this moment he is lying below in this large chasm.
mūrchānvitaḥ śokaparāyaṇo vā kaṣṭaṃ bata kleśamayaṃ prapannaḥ //	By the shock of his fall he must have broken his bones, he has swooned or pines with sorrow. Alas! To what a distress has he come!.
kiṇāṅkitānīva manāṃsi duḥkhairna hīnavargasya tathā vyathante / adṛṣṭaduḥkhānyatisaukumāryādyathottamanāṃ vyasanāgameṣu //	Common people, whose mind has grown callous with suffering, so to speak, are not so much afflicted by their sorrows, as men of high rank, when calamities visiting them plunge them into grief, something new to such as are accustomed to great delicacy.

So considering, the High-minded One, impelled by his compassion went to the brink of the precipice and perceived him struggling there.

dṛṣṭvātha taṃ tatra viceṣṭamānaṃ narādhipaṃ bāṣpaparītanetraḥ / kṛpāvaśādvismṛtaśatrusaṃjñastadduḥkhasāmanyamupājagāma //	Having seen the king in that wretched situation, he forgot that it was his enemy, and affected with pity felt an equal pain to his; tears welled up in his eyes.
uvāca cainaṃ vinayābhijātamudbhāvayan sādhujanasvabhāvam /	And he addressed him with modest and kind language, manifesting his innate pious disposition and comforting him by.

This marvellous speech of the animal roused the admiration of the king. Shame arose within his mind and he began, in truth, to reflect in this manner:.
dṛṣṭāvadāne dviṣati kā nāmāsya dayā mayi / mama vipratipattiśca keyamasminnanāgasi // aho madhuratīkṣṇena pratyādiṣṭo 'smi karmaṇā / ahameva mṛgo gaurvā ko 'pyayaṃ śarabhākṛtiḥ //	How is it possible that he shows pity towards me, his enemy, of whose prowess he perceived himself to be the goal? And how could act so unbecomingly to this innocent one?. Oh! How he confounds me by the sharp reproach of his softness! It is who am the animal, the brute, he is some being bearing only the shape of a śarabha.
tadarhatyayaṃ praṇayapratigrahasaṃpūjanamiti viniścityainamuvāca-	He deserves, therefore, to be honoured by my acceptance of his friendly offer. Having thus made up his mind, he spoke.
vārabāṇāvṛtamidaṃ gātraṃ me nātivikṣatam / prapātaniṣpeṣakṛtāḥ sahyā eva ca me rujaḥ //	My body being covered by my armour has not been too heavily injured, and the pain feel from being crushed in this chasm is at least bearable.
prapataptanakleśānna vahaṃ pīḍitastathā / iti kalyāṇahṛdaye tvayi praskhalanādyathā //	Yet, that grievance caused by my fall does not torment me so much as my offence against a being so pure-hearted and holy as thou.

Then the sarabha, inferring from these friendly words of the king, that he agreed to his proposal, exercised himself with the object of rescuing him, bearing on his back a stone of a man's weight. Having learnt the extent of his strength, determined upon rescuing the king, he went down into the hole and drawing near to him, spoke in a respectful tone:.
madgātrasaṃsparśamimaṃ muhūrtaṃ kāryānurodhāttvamanukṣamasva / yāvatkaromi svahitābhipattyā prītiprasādābhimukhaṃ mukhaṃ te //	Pray, put up for a while with the necessity of touching this body of mine, that, with the object of obtaining my own happiness, may make thy face resplendent with contentment and joy.
tadārohatu matpṛṣṭhaṃ mahārājaḥ sulagnaśca mayi bhavatviti / sa tatheti pratiśrutyainamaśvavadāruroha /	Your Majesty, deign therefore to mount upon my back and cling fast to me. And he, after declaring his approval, mounted his back, as if it were a horse's.
tataḥ samabhyunnatapūrvakāyastenādhirūḍhaḥ sa narādhipena / samutpatannuttamasattvavegaḥ khe toraṇavyālakavadbabhāse //	Then, with the king on his back, he climbed aloft with surpassing vigour and swiftness, and holding high the forepart of his body, resembled some (stone-)elephant rising in the air, as is represented on arches.
uddhṛtya durgādatha taṃ narendraṃ prītaḥ samānīya turaṃgameṇa / nivedya cāsmai svapurāya mārgaṃ vanaprayāṇābhimukho babhūva // atha sa rājā kṛtajñatvāttena tasya vinayamadhureṇopacāreṇa samāvarjitahṛdayaḥ saṃpariṣvajya śarabhamuvāca-	After carrying the king out of that inaccessible place and making him rejoin his horse, he was much rejoiced and told him the way to his capital, and himself prepared to retire to his forest. But the king, moved with gratitude for his kind service, so modestly rendered, embraced the śarabha affectionately, saying:.
prāṇā amī meśarabha tvadīyāḥ prāgeva yatrāsti mama prabhutvam /	This life of mine is at thy disposal, śarabha.
tadarhasi draṣṭumidaṃ puraṃ me satyāṃ rucau tatra ca te 'stu vāsaḥ //	Give me, then, the pleasure of visiting my capital, and if thou likest it, take up thy residence there.
vyādhābhikīrṇe sabhaye vane 'smin śītoṣṇavarṣādyupasargaduḥkhe / hitvā bhavantaṃ mama nanvayuktamekasya gehābhimukhasya gantum // tadehi gacchāva iti // athainaṃ bodhisattvaḥ savinayamadhuropacāraṃ saṃrādhayan pratyuvāca-	Is it not unbecoming to me that should set out for home alone, leaving thee in this dreadful forest haunted by hunters, where thou art exposed to suffering because of cold, heat, rain, and other calamities? Well then, let us go together. Then the Bodhisattva eulogized him in modest, soft and respectful terms, answering thus:.
bhavadvidheṣveva manuṣyavarya yuktaḥ kramo 'yaṃ guṇavatsaleṣu /	In lovers of virtues, like thee, most excellent of men, a behaviour like thine is the proper one.
abhyāsayogena hi sajjanasya svabhāvatāmeva guṇā vrajanti //	For virtues, constantly practised by pious persons, turn out to be an essential part of their very nature..
anugrahītavyamavaiṣi yattu vanocitaṃ māṃ bhavanāśrayeṇa /	But since thou thinkest, that who am accustomed to the forest might be favoured by taking up my residence at thy home, pray, no more of this.
tenālamanyaddhi sukhaṃ narāṇāmanyādṛśaṃ jātyucitaṃ mṛgāṇām //	Of one kind is the pleasure of men, of another that of the forest-animals conformable to the habits of their kind.
cikīrṣitaṃ te yadi matpriyaṃ tu vyādhavrataṃ vīra vimuñca tasmāt /	If, however, thou wantest to do something pleasant to me, then desist from hunting, hero, for ever.
tiryaktvabhāvājjaḍacetaneṣu kṛpaiva śocyeṣu mṛgeṣu yuktā //	The poor beasts of the forest, being brute and dull of intellect, are worth pitying for this very reason.
sukhāśraye duḥkhavinodena ca samānacittānavagaccha sattvān /	With respect to the pursuit of happiness and the removal of mischief, the animals, thou shouldst know, are subject to the same feelings as men.
ityātmanaḥ syādanabhīpsitaṃ yanna tatpareṣvācarituṃ kṣamaṃ te //	Keeping this in mind, deem it improper to do to others what would be a cause of displeasure, if done to thyself.
kīrtikṣayaṃ sādhujanādvigarhāṃ duḥkhaṃ ca pāpaprabhavaṃ viditvā / pāpaṃ dviṣatpakṣamivoddharasva nopekṣituṃ vyādhiriva kṣamaṃ te //	Understanding that evil deeds entail loss of reputation, censure by the virtuous, and moreover suffering, thou must extirpate the evil within thee, considering it thy adversary. It never becomes thee to overlook it, no more than illness.
lakṣmīniketaṃ yadapāśrayeṇa prāpto 'si lokābhimataṃ nṛpatvam /	It is by pursuing meritorious actions that thou obtainedst the royal dignity, a thing highly esteemed by men and the abode of bliss.
tānyeva puṇyāni vivardhayethā na karśanīyo hyupakāripakṣaḥ //	That very store of merit thou must enlarge, thou shouldst not enfeeble the ranks of the benefactors.
śīlena sādhu[jana]saṃgataniścayena / bhūteṣu cātmani yathā hitabuddhisiddhyā puṇyāni saṃcinu yaśaḥ sukhasādhanāni //	Gather meritorious actions, the instruments of glory and happiness, by munificent gifts, (taking care) to enhance their charm by (distributing them at the right) time and in a respectful.

tadevaṃ jighāṃsumapyāpadgatamanukampanta eva mahākāruṇikā nopekṣanta iti karuṇāvarṇe 'pi vācyam /	In this manner the intensely compassionate show pity even to him who attempts their life, when he is in distress; they will not disregard such a one.
tathāgatamāhātmye satkṛtya dharmaśravaṇe /	[This story is to be told also when treating of commiseration, when discoursing on the high-mindedness of the Tathāgata and on the subject of listening with attention to the preaching of the Law.

For In the original two short syllables are wanting in the second pada of this stanza.

He had his residence in a remote part of a large wilderness, far from the paths of men and overgrown with a rich, manifold vegetation. There were a great number of sāls, bakulas, piyālas, hintālas, tamālas, naktamālas, of vidula and nicula reeds and of shrubs; thickets of śimśapās, tiniśas, śamīs, palāśas, śākas, of kuśa-grass, bamboo and reeds encumbered it; kadambas, sarjas, arjunas, dhavas, khadiras, and kutajas abounded in it; and the outstretched branches of many trees were covered as if by a veil with the tendrils of manifold creeping plants. It was the abode of a great many forest-animals: deer of the ruru, pṛṣata and sṛmara varieties, yaks, elephants, gavaya-oxen, buffaloes, antelopes of the harina and the nyanku kind, boars, panthers, hyenas, tigers, wolves, lions, bears, and others. Among them that ruru-deer was conspicuous by its hue brilliant like pure gold and the very soft hair of his body, which was moreover adorned and resplendent with spots of different lovely colours, shining like rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and beryls.

Moreover, he warned also the animals who followed after him to avoid them. He exercised his rule over them like a teacher, like a father.

Now once upon a time it happened that the High-minded One, residing in that wild part of the forest, heard cries for help uttered by some man who was being carried away by the current of a rapid stream flowing near and lately swollen by the rains.
abhidhāvata dīnavatsalāḥ kṛpaṇaṃ tārayituṃ javena mām //	Come to me, pitiful people; come quickly to rescue a wretch.

These piteous cries of distress struck the Bodhisattva, and as if he were wounded by them in his heart, he rushed out of the thicket, exclaiming those comforting words he had been wont to use in hundreds of. So even now he succeeded in bringing forth the words do not fear! do not fear! in plain human voice repeatedly and loudly.
dūrata eva ca taṃ puruṣamiṣṭamivopāyanamānīyamānaṃ salilaughena dadarśa /	And coming out of the forest he saw from afar that man, like a precious present brought to him by the stream.
tatastaduttāraṇaniścitāmā svaṃ prāṇasaṃdehamacintayitvā / sa tāṃ nadīṃ bhīmarayāṃ jagāhe vikṣobhayan vīra ivārisenām //	Then, resolved upon rescuing him and without minding the risk of his own life, he entered the river that was running with tremendous rapidity, like a brave warrior disturbing a hostile army.
āvṛtya mārgaṃ vapuṣātha tasya mamāśrayasveti tamabhyuvāca /	He placed himself across his way, then told him to cling fast to him.
trāsāturatvācchramavihvalāṅgaḥ sa pṛṣṭhamevādhiruroha tasya //	And the man, who was in the paroxysm of fear and had almost lost the power of his limbs, his strength being exhausted, climbed on his back.

Having brought the man to the riverside and dispelled his weariness and pain, obtaining by this a very great rejoicing himself, he warmed his cold limbs with the warmth of his own body, then dismissed him.
svenoṣmaṇā samapanīya ca śītamasya gaccheti taṃ sa visasarja nivedya mārgam //	Go, he said, showing him the way.

Bowing his head to him, he addressed him with kind words like these.
ā bālyātsaṃbhṛtasnehaḥ suhṛdbāndhava eva vā / nālaṃ kartumidaṃ karma madarthe yatkṛtaṃ tvayā //	No friend from childhood nor kinsman is capable of performing such a deed as thou hast done for me.

viniyogakṣamatvaṃ me bhavān yatrāvagacchati // athainaṃ bodhisattvaḥ saṃrādhayan pratyuvāca-	Why, procure me that favour by ordering me to do something for thee, in whatever respect Thy Honour thinks me fit for employment. In reply to this the Bodhisattva said approvingly:.
na citrarūpā sujane kṛtajñatā nisargasiddhaiva hi tasya sā sthitiḥ /	Gratitude is not at all to be wondered at in a gentleman. For this quality proceeds from his very nature.
jagattu dṛṣṭvā samudīrṇavikriyaṃ kṛtajñatāpyadya guṇeṣu gaṇyate //	But seeing the corruptness of the world, even gratitude is nowadays reckoned among the virtues.

tanughṛṇāni bahulaulyādanibhṛtāni ca prāyeṇa mānuṣahṛdayāni /	Lo, as a rule, the hearts of men, owing to their great covetousness, possess little mercy or self-restraint.

tadetatpriyaṃ bhavatā saṃpadyamānamicchāmīti / sa tatheti pratiśrutya praṇamya pradakṣiṇīkṛtya ca taṃ mahāsattvaṃ svagṛhamabhyājagāma //	So then, thou wilt please me by doing as said. And the man promised to do so, and after bowing to the Great Being and circumambulating him, set out for his home.
tena khalu samayena tatrānyatamasya rājño devī satyasvapnā babhūva /	Now at that time there lived in that country a queen of some king who saw true dreams.

She saw a ruru-deer of resplendent brilliancy, shining like a heap of jewels of every kind, standing on a throne and surrounded by the king and his assembly, preaching the Law in a human voice of an articulate and distinct sound.
vismayākṣiptahṛdayā ca bhartuḥ prabodhapaṭahadhvaninā saha sā vyabudhyata /	Affected with astonishment she awoke with the beating of drums which were to arouse her husband from sleep.
yathāprastāvaṃ ca samupetya rājānaṃ labdhaprasarapraṇayasaṃmānā	And she took the first opportunity to go and see the king, who kindly received her not only with the honour she deserved but also with solicitous affection.
sā vismayotphullatarekṣaṇaśrīḥ prītyā samutkampikapolaśobhā / upāyaneneva nṛpaṃ dadarśa tenādbhutasvapnanivedanena //	Then she, whose bright eyes enlarged with astonishment and whose lovely cheeks were trembling from gladness, presented her lord with the account of that marvellous dream as with a gift of homage.
nivedya ca taṃ svapnātiśayaṃ rājñe sādaraṃ punaruvāca- tatsādhu tāvatkriyatāṃ rājñe sādaraṃ punaruvāca-	When she had told her wonderful dream to the king, she added this earnest request: It was the custom to awake the king by the sound of music and songs.
tatsādhu tāvatkriyatāṃ mṛgasya tasyopalambhaṃ prati deva yatnaḥ /	Therefore, my lord, pray endeavour to obtain that deer.
antaḥpuraṃ ratnamṛgeṇa tena tārāmṛgeṇeva nabho virājet // atha sa rājā dṛṣṭapratyayastasyāḥ svapnadarśanasya pratigṛhya tadvacanaṃ tatpriyakāmyayā ratnamṛgādhigamalobhācca tasya mṛgasyānveṣaṇārthaṃ sarvaṃ vyādhagaṇaṃ samādideśa / pratyahaṃ ca puravare ghoṣaṇāmiti kārayāmāsa-	Adorned with this jewel-deer, your zenana would be as resplendent as the sky with the Deer-asterism. The king, who trusted by experience the visions of her dreams, readily complied with her desire, partly that he might do something agreeable to her, partly because he himself was covetous of obtaining that jewel deer. Accordingly he ordered all his huntsmen to search for that deer, and had this proclamation made public in his capital day after day:.
hemacchavirmaṇiśatairiva citragātraḥ	There exists a deer gold-skinned and spotted with various colours shining like hundreds of jewels.
khyāto mṛgaḥ śrutiṣu dṛṣṭacaraśca kaiścit /	It is celebrated in the holy texts, and some have got the sight of it.
yastaṃ pradarśayati tasya dadāti rājā grāmottamaṃ paridaśā rucirāḥ striyaśca // atha sa puruṣastāṃ ghoṣaṇāṃ punaḥ punarupaśrutya	Whosoever will show that deer to him the king gives a very rich village and full ten lovely women. Now the man (who had been rescued by the Bodhisattva) heard that proclamation again and again.
dāridryaduḥkhagaṇanāparikhinnacetāḥ smṛtvā ca taṃ rurumṛgasya mahopakāram / lobhena tena ca kṛtena vikṛṣyamāṇo	As he was poor, the reflection on the sufferings of poverty afflicted his heart, but on the other hand he kept in mind the great benefit he had received from the ruru-deer.
dolāyamānahṛdayo vimamarśa tattat //	Mrgasiras, corresponding with the head of Orion..

Having so resolved, putting out of his mind the benefit of the ruru deer, he went up to the king and said: , Your Majesty, know that excellent deer and his dwelling-place.
tacchrutvā sa rājā pramuditamanāḥ-mamaivainaṃ bhadra pradarśayetyuktvā mṛgayāprayāṇārūpaṃ veṣamāsthāya mahatā balakāyena parivṛtaḥ puravarānnirgamya tena puruṣeṇādeśyamānamārgastaṃ nadītīramupajagāma /	Pray, tell me to whom shall show him. On hearing this, the king much rejoiced answered him, Well, friend, show him to myself, and putting on his hunting-dress left his capital, accompanied by a large body of his army. Conducted by the man, he went to the aforesaid riverside.
parikṣipya ca tadvanagahanaṃ samagreṇa balakāyena dhanvī hastāvāpī vyavasitāptapuruṣaparivṛtaḥ sa rājā tenaiva puruṣeṇādeśyamānamārgastadvanagahanamanupraviveśa / atha sa puruṣastaṃ rurumṛgaṃ viśvastasthitamālokya pradarśayāmāsa rājñe-ayamayaṃ deva sa mṛgavaraḥ /	Then he encircled the forest adjoining it with the whole of his forces, but himself bearing his bow, wearing his finger-guard and surrounded by a select number of resolute and faithful men, entered the thicket, being shown the way by that man. As they went onward, the man discovering the ruru-deer who quietly and unsuspectingly was staying in his forest, showed him to the king, exclaiming: Here, here is that similar reasoning is made by Śakra, when he tries the Bodhisattva in his Avişahya-existence, see Story, stanzas -.
paśyatvenaṃ devaḥ, prayatnaśca bhavatviti /	May Your Majesty deign to look at him and be careful..
tasyonnāmayato bāhuṃ mṛgasaṃdarśanādarāt / prakoṣṭhannyapatatpāṇirvinikṛtta ivāsinā /\	So saying he raised his arm, eager as he was to point at the deer, and lo, his hand fell down off his arm, as if it had been cut off with a sword.
āsādya vastūni hi tādṛśāni kriyaviśeṣairabhisaṃskṛtāni / labdhaprayāmāṇi vipakṣamāndyātkarmāṇi sadyaḥ phalatāṃ vrajanti // aha sa rājā tatpradarśitena mārgeṇa rurusaṃdarśanakutūhale nayane vicikṣepa /	Indeed, when directed at such objects hallowed by their extraordinary performances, one's actions come immediately to ripeness, provided that they are of consequence and there is but little to counterbalance them. Then the king, curious to get the sight of the ruru-deer, let his eyes pass along the way shown by the man.
vane 'tha taminnavameghanīle jvalattanuṃ ratnanidhānalakṣmyā / guṇairuruṃ taṃ sa ruruṃ dadarśa śātahradaṃ vahnimivābhrakakṣe /\	And in the midst of that wood, dark as clouds newly formed, he perceived a body shining with the lustre of a treasury of jewels, and saw that deer, dear by his illustrious properties.
tadrūpaśobhāhṛtamānaso 'tha sa bhūmipastadgrahaṇātilobhāt /	So does the fire of lightning appear out of the womb of the cloud.

But the Bodhisattva, on hearing the noise of people on every side, had thereby concluded that he must have been surrounded, to be sure. Afterwards perceiving the king coming up ready to shoot off his arrow at him, he understood there was no opportunity for running away..
tiṣṭha tāvanmahārāja mā māṃ vyātsīrnararṣabha /	Stop a moment, mighty prince, do not hit me, hero among men! Pray, first satisfy my curiosity, and tell me this.
asāvatra mṛgo 'stīti ko nu te māṃ nyavedayat // atha sa rājā tasyādbhutena mānuṣeṇābhivyāhāreṇa bhṛśataramāvarjitahṛdayastasmai puruṣaṃ śarāgreṇa nirdideśa-ayamasyātyadbhutasya no darśayiteti /	Who may have discovered my abode to thee, far as it is from the paths of men, saying that, such a deer, dwell in this thicket? The king, touched by this wonderful address in a human voice and taking still more interest in him, showed him that man with the point of his arrow.
atha bodhisattvastaṃ puruṣaṃ pratyabhijñāya vigarhamāṇa uvāca-kaṣṭaṃ bhoḥ /	This man, he said, has disclosed thy extremely marvellous person to us. But the Bodhisattva knowing again that man, spoke disapprovingly: Fie upon him!,.
dārveva varamuddhartuṃ nākṛtajñamatiṃ janam // pariśramasya tasyeyamīdṛśī pratyupakriyā / ātmano 'pi na dṛṣṭo 'yaṃ hitasyāpanayaḥ katham // atha sa rājā kiṃ nu khalvayamevaṃ vijugupsata iti samutpannakautūhalaḥ sāvegastaṃ rurumuvāca-	It is a true saying, in truth ‘better is it to take a log out of the water than to save an ungrateful person from it. In this manner he returns that exertion made in his behalf! How is it that he did not see that he destroyed his own happiness, too, at the same time? Now the king, being curious to know what he might thus reproach, vividly said to the ruru-deer:,.
anirbhinnārthagambhīramanārabhyavigarhitam / tvadidaṃ samupaśrutya sākampamiva me manaḥ //	On hearing thee censure somebody without catching the meaning of thy obscure words or knowing with respect of whom thou spokest them, my mind is somewhat alarmed.
mṛgātiśaya tadbrūhi kamārabhyeti bhāṣase / manuṣyamamanuṣyaṃ vā pakṣiṇaṃ mṛgameva vā //	In other words, in such cases the evil karma has so great a strength that a considerable amount of good works would be required in order to check the rapidity of the development of its fruit..
nāyaṃ vigarhādara eva rājan kutsārhametattvavagamya karma / nāyaṃ punaḥ kartumiti vyavasyettīkṣnākṣaraṃ tena mayaivamuktam //	No desire of blaming prompted me, king, to this utterance, but becoming aware of this blame-deserving action, spoke sharp words in order to prevent him from attempting to do such a thing again.

But even to his beloved son a physician is obliged to apply such medical treatment as is made necessary by his illness.
tato bhayaṃ māṃ nṛvaredamāgataṃ na khalvasatsaṃgatamasti bhūtaye //	He whom, moved by pity, rescued, when he was carried off by the current, is the man who made this danger arise for me, best of men.

Then the king, casting on that man a stern look expressive of harsh reproach, asked him: Oh, in truth, wast thou rescued before from such a distress by this deer? And the man, who was pale and perspired with fear, sorrow, and dejection, answered in a low tone of shame: Yes, was. Upon which the king revilingly exclaimed: Fie upon thee! and placing the arrow on the bowstring he continued: Do not think it a trifle!.
evaṃvidhenāpi pariśrameṇa mṛdūkṛtaṃ yasya na nāma cetaḥ /	He whose heart was not even softened by an exertion like that employed in thy behalf, is a vile representative of his.
tulyākṛtīnāmayaśodhvajena kiṃ jīvatānena narādhamena // ityuktvā muṣṭimābadhya tadvadhārthaṃ dhanuḥ pracakarṣa /	Why should this lowest of men live any longer? With these words he grasped his bow in the middle and bent it in order to kill him.
atha bodhisattvaḥ karuṇayā mahatyāsamuparudhyamānahṛdayastadantarā sthitvā rājānamuvaca-alamalaṃ mahārāja hataṃ hatvā /	But the Bodhisattva, overpowered by his great compassion, placed himself between, saying to the king: Stop, Your Majesty, stop, do not strike one already stricken!.
yadeva lobhadviṣataḥ pratāraṇāṃ vigarhitāmapyayamabhyupeyivān / hatastadeveha yaśaḥ parikṣayāddhruvaṃ paratrāpi ca dharmasaṃkṣakyāt //	At the very moment that he listened to the culpable enticement of Cupidity, his enemy, at that moment surely, he was ruined both in this world, because of the loss of his good name, and in the next too, his righteousness being destroyed.
asahyaduḥkhodayapītamānasāḥ patanti caivaṃ vyasaneṣu mānuṣāḥ / pralobhyamānāḥ phalasaṃpadāśayā pataṃgamūrkhā iva dīpaśobhayā //	Yea, in this way, when their soundness of mind has faded away in consequence of unbearable sufferings, men fall into calamities, being allured by the prospect of rich profit, like foolish moths attracted to the shining of a light.
ataḥ kṛpāmatra kuruṣva mā ruṣaṃ yadīpsitaṃ caivamanena kiṃcana /	Thou must, therefore, rather pity him and restrain thy wrath. And if he wanted to obtain something by so acting, let not his rash deed lack that reward.

This merciful and sincere desire to reward even the man who had ill treated him excited the highest surprise of the king. His heart became converted, and looking up with veneration to the ruru-deer, he exclaimed: Well said, well said, holy being.
pratyakṣogrāpakāre 'pi dayā yasyeyamīdṛśī / guṇato mānuṣastvaṃ hi vayamākṛtimānuṣāḥ //	Verily, showing such mercy to him whose cruel offence against thee is evident, thou art a human being by thy properties, we do bear but the shape of men..

The ruru-deer said: accept this royal boon, illustrious king, which is not given in vain.
tadājñāpaya yāvadiha saṃgamanaprayojanena tavopayogaṃ gacchāma iti // atha sa rājā taṃ ruruṃ gurumiva rathavaramāropya mahatā satkāreṇa puravaraṃ praveśya kṛtātithisatkāraṃ mahati siṃhāsane niveśya samutsāhayamānaḥ sāntaḥpuro 'mātyagaṇaparivṛtaḥ prītibahumānasaumyamudīkṣamāṇo dharmaṃ papraccha-	Therefore, deign to give me thy orders, that our meeting here may afford thee profit and that may be of some use to thee. Then the king made the ruru-deer mount his royal chariot, worshipping him like his teacher, and led him with great pomp to his capital. And having given him the reception due to a guest and invited him to place himself on the royal throne, he with his wives and the whole retinue of his officers exhorted him to preach the Law, and raising his eyes to him with a kind expression of gladness mixed with reverence, entreated him in this manner:.
dharmaṃ prati manuṣyamāṇāṃ bahudhā buddhayo gatāḥ /	There is a great diversity of opinions among men concerning the Law, but thou possessest the certainty about the Law.
niścayastava dharme tu yathā taṃ vaktumarhasi // atha bodhiattvastasya rājñaḥ saparṣatkasya sphuṭamadhuracitrākṣareṇa vacasā dharmaṃ deśayāmāsa-	Deign, therefore, to preach it to us. Upon which the Bodhisattva raised his voice and preached the Law to the king and his royal assembly in words distinctly spoken in a soft tone and elegantly composed.
dayāṃ sattveṣu manye 'haṃ dharmaṃ saṃkṣepato nṛpa / hiṃsāsteyanivṛttyādiprabhedaṃ vividhakriyam // paśya mahārāja /	Of the Law with the manifold performances depending on it and with its subdivisions: abstaining from injuring others, from theft, and so on, this, believe, is the brief summary Mercy to the creatures. Look here, illustrious prince..
ātmanīva dayā syāccetsvajane vā yathā jane / kasya nāma bhaveccittamadharmapraṇayāśivam //	If mercy to all creatures should make men hold them like themselves or their own family, whose heart would ever cherish the baleful desire for wickedness?.
dayāviyogāttu janaḥ paramāmeti vikriyām / manovākkāyavispandaiḥ svajane 'pi jane yathā // dharmarthī na tyajedasmāddayāmiṣṭaphalodayām /	But the lack of mercy is to men the cause of the greatest disturbance, as it corrupts the action of their minds and words and bodies no less with respect to their family than to strangers.
suvṛṣṭiriva sasyāni guṇān sa hi prasūyate //	Mercy, indeed, engenders virtues, as a fructifying rain makes the crops grow.
dayākrāntaṃ cittaṃ na bhavati paradroharabhasaṃ śucau tasmin vāṇī vrajati vikṛtaṃ naiva ca tanuḥ /	Mercy, possessing a man's mind, destroys in it the passion for injuring one's neighbour; and his mind being pure, neither his speech nor his body will be perverted.
vivṛddhā tasyaivaṃ parahitaruciḥ prītyanusṛtān pradānakṣāntyādīñjanayati guṇān kīrtyanuguṇān //	So the love of one's neighbour's good always increases and becomes the source of many other virtues: charity, forbearance, and so on, which are followed by gladness of mind and are conducive to reputation.
dayālurnodvegaṃ janayati pareṣāmupaśamā-	The merciful one does not arouse apprehension in the mind of others because of his tranquillity.
ddayāvān viśvāsyo bhavati jagatāṃ bāndhava iva /	Owing to his mercy, everybody will hold him a person to be trusted, as if he were their kinsman.
na saṃrambhakṣobhaḥ prabhavati dayādhīrahṛdaye na kopāgniścitte jvalati hi dayātoyaśiśire //	No agitation of passion will seize him whose heart has been made firm by mercy, nor does the fire of anger blaze within his mind which enjoys the coolness of water, thanks to mercy.
atha sa rājā samabhinandya tattasya vacanaṃ sapaurajānapado dharmaparāyaṇo babhūva /	Why use many words? For this reason the wise firmly believe that in Mercy the whole of Righteousness is contained..
abhayaṃ ca sarvamṛgapakṣiṇāṃ dattavān //	And he granted security to all quadrupeds and birds.
tadevaṃ paraduḥkhameva duḥkhaṃ sādhūnām /	In this manner, then, for the virtuous no suffering exists but that of others.
taddhi na sahante nātmaduḥkhamiti /	It is this they cannot bear, not their own suffering.
karuṇāvarṇe 'pi vācyam / sajjanamāhātmye khalajanakutsāyāmapyupaneyamiti // iti rurujātakaṃ ṣaḍviṃśatitamam //	[This story is also to be told when discoursing on compassion, and may be adduced when treating of the high-mindedness of the virtuous, also when censuring the mischievous.] In the fourth pada of this stanza sa is a misprint for sā..
dviṣatāmapi mānasānyāvarjayanti sadvṛttānuvartinaḥ /	, Fausböll, -) Those who follow the behaviour of the virtuous win over even the hearts of their enemies.
tadyathānuśrūyate-	This will be taught as follows.

It is irrigated by mountain-currents whose water possesses the limpidity of crystals, and resounds with the music of manifold crowds of birds. In that forest the Bodhisattva lived, it is said, a chief of a troop of monkeys.
tadavasthamapi cainaṃ tyāgakāruṇyābhyāsātpratipakṣasevāvirodhitānīverṣyāmātsaryakrauryāṇi nopajagmuḥ /	But even in that state in consequence of his constant practice of charity and compassion jealousy, selfishhness, and cruelty, as if they were at war with him because he attended on their enemies (the virtues), would not enter his mind.

Those branches were somewhat curved, being loaded with excellent fruits of a size surpassing that of palmyra-nuts, and distinguished by an exceedingly sweet flavour and a lovely colour and smell..
tiryaggatānāmapi bhāgyaśeṣaṃ satāṃ bhavatyeva sukhāśrayāya / kartavyasaṃbandhi suhṛjjanānāṃ videśagānāmiva vittaśeṣam //	The virtuous, even when they are in the state of animals, have still some remainder of good fortune which tends to the happiness of their friends, for whose sake they employ it, in the same manner as the remainder of the wealth of people abroad may serve the wants of their friends.
tasya tu vanaspaterekā śākhā tatsamīpagāṃ nimnagāmabhi praṇatābhavat / atha bodhisattvo dīrghadarśitvāttadvānarayūthaṃ samanuśaśāsa-asyāṃ nyagrodhaśākhāyāmaphalāyāmakṛtāyāṃ na vaḥ kenacidanyataḥ phalamupabhoktavyamiti // atha kadācittasyāṃ śākhāyāṃ pipīlikābhiḥ parṇapuṭāvcchāditaṃ taruṇatvānnātimahadekaṃ phalaṃ na te vānarā dadṛśuḥ /	Now one branch of that tree hung over a river which passed by that place. Now the Bodhisattva, far-sighted as he was, had instructed his flock of monkeys in this manner: Unless ye prevent this banian-branch from having fruit, none of you will ever be able to eat any fruit from the other branches. Now it once happened that the monkeys overlooked one young, and for this reason not very big, fruit, hidden as it was in the cavity of some leaf crooked by ants.

Being carried down the stream, it stuck at last in the network of a fence In other words it is said, that though their store of merit, producing good fortune, must have been exhausted according to their being born beasts, yet there is left some remainder, the effect of which may assuage them in that low state. In the Pāli redaction that river is the Ganges and the king Brahmadatta of Benares.
visarpiṇā svena tiraścakāra ghrāṇābhirāmeṇa guṇodayena //	Considering the abruptness of the narration, it seems there is something wanting in the text.
tadgandhamattāḥ kṣaṇamaṅganāstā dīrghīkṛtocchvāsavikuñcitākṣyaḥ /	This smell soon enchanted the women; they enjoyed it with prolonged inhalations and half-shut eyes.
bhūtvātha kautūhalacañcalāni vicikṣipurdikṣu vilocanāni //	And being curious to know its origin, they cast their eyes in all directions.
kautūhalaprasṛtalolataranayanāstu tā yoṣitastannyagrodhaphalaṃ paripakvatālaphalādhikatarapramāṇaṃ jālakaraṇḍakapārśvato vilagnamavekṣya kimidamiti tadāvarjitanayanāḥ samapadyanta saha rājñā /	And while casting their eyes, stirred by curiosity, all around, the women perceived that banian fig, surpassing by its size a ripe palmyra nut, as it stuck to the network of the fence, and having once discovered it, they could not keep their eyes from it. Nor was the king less curious to know the nature of that fruit.
atha sa rājā tatphalamānāyya prātyayikavaidyajanaparidṛṣṭaṃ svayamāsvādayāmāsa / adbhutena rasenātha nṛpastasya visiṣmiye / adbhutena raseneva prayogaguṇahāriṇā //	He had it brought to him, and after examination by reliable physicians tasted it himself. Its marvellous flavour (rasa) raised the king's amazement, as (in a dramatic composition) the marvellous sentiment (rasa), ravishing (the mind of the spectators) by a good representation, rouses their admiration.
apūrvavarṇagandhābhyāṃ tasyākalitavismayaḥ / yayau tadrasasaṃrāgātparāṃ vismayavikriyām //	Had its extraordinary colour and smell stirred his surprise before, now its flavour filled him with the highest admiration, and agitated him with lust.
atha tasya rājñaḥ svādurasabhojanasamucitasyāpi tadrasasaṃrāgavaśagasyaitadabhavat-	Though accustomed to dainties, the king became so eager to enjoy that relish that this thought came to him.

But he who gets them is really a king, and this without the toil of exercising royal power. Accordingly, having made up his mind to find out its origin, he reasoned in this way to himself. Surely, the excellent tree, whence came this fruit, cannot be far from here and it must stand on the riverside.
tathā hyanupahatavarṇagandharasamadīrghakālasalilasaṃparkādaparikṣatamajarjaraṃ ca yataḥ śakyamasya prabhāvo 'dhigantumiti niścayamupetya tadrasatṛṣṇayā ākṛṣyamāṇo virabhya jalakrīḍāyāḥ samyak puravare sve rakṣāvidhānaṃ saṃdiśya yātrāasajjena mahatā balakāyena parivṛtastāṃ nadīmanusasāra /	For it cannot have been in contact with the water for a long time, since it has kept its colour, smell, and flavour intact, and is moreover undamaged and shows no trace of decomposition. For this reason, it is possible to pursue its origin. Having so resolved, as he was possessed by a strong desire for that delicious flavour, he ceased that water-sport, and, after taking such measures as were suitable for the maintenance of order in his capital (during his absence), set out, accompanied by a great body of armed people equipped for expedition.
krameṇa cotsādayan saśvāpadagaṇāni vanagahanāni sasmanubhavaṃścitrāṇi rasāntarāṇi paśyannakṛtrimaramaṇīyaśobhāni vanāntarāṇi saṃtrāsayan paṭaharasitairvanyagajamṛgān mānuṣajanadurgamaṃ tasya vanaspateḥ samīpamupajagāma /	With them he marched up the river and enjoyed the different and various sensations proper to journeying in a forest-region, clearing his way through thickets haunted by ferocious animals, beholding woodlands of great natural beauty, and frightening elephants and deer by the noise of his drums. At last he reached the neighbourhood of that tree, a place difficult for men to approach.
taṃ meghavṛndamiva toyabharāvasanna- māsannaśailamapi śailavadīkṣyamāṇam / dūraddadarśa nṛpatiḥ sa vanaspatīndra-mullokyamānamadhirājamivānyavṛkṣaiḥ //	Like a mass of clouds hanging down by the burden of their water, this lord of trees appeared from afar to the eyes of the king dominating the other trees which seemed to look up to it as to their sovereign, and, though it stood near a steep mountain, resembling a mountain itself..
samupetya cainaṃ dadarśa tatphalopabhogavyāpṛtairanekavānaraśatairākīrṇaviṭapam //	Coming near, he saw many hundreds of apes filling its boughs and branches and occupied in eating its fruits.

atha te rājapuruṣāḥ sajyacāpabāṇavyagrakarāgrā vānarāvabhartsanamukharāḥ samudyataloṣṭadaṇḍaśastrāścāpare paradurgamivābhiroddhukāmāstaṃ vanaspatimabhisasruḥ /	And those warriors made themselves ready to shoot off the arrows from their bows (strung), and uttered cries to frighten away the monkeys; others lifted up clods and sticks and spears to throw at them. They invaded the tree, as if they were to attack a hostile fortress.

His mind was affected with the utmost compassion. Being himself free from affliction, sadness, and anxiety, he comforted his tribe of monkeys, and having resolved upon their rescue, climbed to the top of the tree, desirous to jump over to the mountain-peak near it.
athānekapraskandanakramaprāpyamapi taṃ giritaṭaṃ sa mahāsattvaḥ svavīryātiśayātkhaga ivādhiruroha /	And although that place could be reached only by many successive leaps, the Great Being, by dint of his surpassing heroism, passed across like a bird and held the spot..
dvābhyāmapi laṅghanakramābhyāṃ gamyaṃ naiva tadanyavānarāṇām / vegena yadantaraṃ tarasvī pratatārālpamivaikavikrameṇa //	Other monkeys would not be able to traverse that space even in two successive leaps, but he, the courageous one, swiftly crossed it with one single bound, as if it were a small distance.
kṛpayābhivivardhitaḥ sa tasya vyavasāyaḥ paṭutāṃ jagāma śauryāt /	His compassion had fostered his strong determination, but it was his heroism which brought it to its perfection.
sa ca yatnaviśeṣamasya cakre manasaivātha jagāma yatnataikṣṇyāt //	So he made his utmost effort to carry it out, and by the earnestness of his exertion he found the way to it in his mind.

This he fastened to his feet, after which he jumped back to the tree.
viprakṛṣṭatvāttu tasyāntarālasya caraṇabandhanavyākulatvācca sa mahāsattvaḥ kathaṃcittasya vanaspateragraśākhāṃ karābhyāṃ samāsasāda /	But as the distance was great and he was embarrassed by his feet being tied, the Great Being hardly succeeded in seizing with his hands the nearest branch of the tree.
tataḥ samālambya dṛḍhaṃ sa śākhāmātatya tāṃ vetralatāṃ ca yatnāt / svasaṃjñayā yūthamathādideśa drumādataḥ śīghramabhiprayāyāt /\ atha te vānarā bhayāturatvādapayānamārgamāsādya capalataragatayastadākramaṇanirviśaṅkāstayā svastyapacakramuḥ /	Then holding fast that branch and keeping the cane stretched by his effort, he ordered his tribe, making them the signal proper to his race, to come quickly off the tree. And the monkeys, as they were bewildered by fear, having found that way of retreat, hastened to make use of it, wildly rushing over his body without regard to him, and safely escaped along that cane.
bhayāturaistasya tu vānaraistairākramyamāṇaṃ caraṇaiḥ prasaktam / gātraṃ yayau svaiḥ piśitairviyogaṃ na tveva dhairyātiśayena cetaḥ //	While being incessantly trodden by the feet of those fear bewildered monkeys, his body lost the solidity of its flesh, but his mind did not lose its extraordinary firmness.
taddṛṣṭvā sa rājā te ca rājapuruṣāḥ parāṃ vismayavaktavyatāmupajagmuḥ /	On beholding this, the king and his men were overcome with the utmost astonishment..

Then the king commanded his men in this manner: This chief of apes, he said, having his limbs shaken and bruised by the feet of the multitude of monkeys who, agitated by fear, ran over his body, and remaining in that same position for a long time, must be excessively tired. Surely, he will be unable to retire from this difficult posture by himself.

And they did so. Then the king ordered the monkey to be gently lifted off the canopy and placed on a soft couch.

When he had recovered his senses, he was visited by the king, who, affected with curiosity, admiration, and respect, after asking him about his health, continued thus:.
gatvā svayaṃ saṃkramatāmamīṣāṃ svajīvite tyaktadayena bhūtvā /	Thou madest thy body a bridge for those monkeys, and feeling no mercy for thy own life, rescuedst them.
samuddhṛtā ye kapayastvayeme ko nu tvameṣāṃ tava vā ka ete //	What art thou to them or what are they to thee?.
śrotuṃ vayaṃ cedidamarharūpāstattāvadācakṣva kapipradhāna /	If thou deemest me a person worth hearing this matter, pray, tell it me, foremost of monkeys.
na hyalpasauhārdanibandhanānāmevaṃ manāṃsi prataranti kartum //	No small fetters of friendship, methinks, should fasten one's mind to enable it to do the like performances..
atha bodhisattvastasya rājñastadabhyupapattisaumukhyaṃ pratipūjayannātmanivedanamanuguṇena krameṇa cakāra-	He said:.
ebhirmadājñāpratipattidakṣairāropito mayyadhipatvabhāraḥ /	Those, always prompt to act up to my orders, charged me with the burden of being their ruler.
iyaṃ mahārāja samaṃ mamaibhiḥ saṃbandhajātiścirakālarūḍhā /	This, mighty sovereign, is the kind of relation existing between them and me.
samānajātitvamayī ca maitrī jñāteyajātā sahavāsayogāt //16 /	It is rooted by time and has increased the friendly feelings existing between animals of the same species.
tacchrutvā sa rājā paraṃ vismayamupetya punarenamuvāca-	Our dwelling together has strengthened it to the mutual affection of kinsmen. On hearing this, the king affected with great admiration replied:.
adhipārthamamātyādi na tadarthaṃ mahīpatiḥ /	The ministers and the rest of his officials are to serve the interest of their lord, not the king to serve theirs.

Under the disguise of a Muni this hypocrite acts like a fowler. These words alarmed and disturbed the eunuchs, who said to the king: Your Majesty ought not to speak so.

Nevertheless the king, in the pervertedness of his mind, did not take to heart their words, and continued: Alas! Ah! This can be no wonder, for in the Pāli Jātaka, that wicked king is identified with Devadatta..

Then they went to meet the king, and as they stood near him with their folded hands lifted up to their face, they had the appearance of an assemblage of lotuses in autumn, when the brightness of the flowers begins to peep out of the enclosure of the buds.

Now, the king in his fit of wrath having thus rebuked his queens and shown his hard-heartedness, they were affected with sorrow and sadness, for they knew his ferocious nature and his contumacy which made him inaccessible to persuasion. The eunuchs, who were likewise alarmed, affected with anxiety, and afflicted, made signs to them with their hands that they should withdraw, So they went away, lowering their faces with shame and lamenting over that best of Rsis.

After the queens thus lamenting and sighing on his account for what could they else do for him? were gone, the king in wrath came up to the holy Rși, threatening him with drawn sword, in order to strike him himself.

Literally: as if it were the earth.

But the king disdained these gentle flowers of speech which the Muni offered him. Scornfully he said to that foremost of Rṣis: Let us now see your attacthment to forbearance, and so speaking he directed his sharp sword to the right hand of the Muni, which was a little extended towards him, with a prohibitive gesture, having its very fine and long fingers upward, and severed it from his arm like a lotus from its stalk.

This caused great consternation all around, and perplexed and alarmed the royal attendants. The king's ministers, knowing the grandeur of the penance power of that Muni and imputing to it the catastrophe of the king, were affected with anxiety, lest that holy Rṣi should burn down the whole country on account of the king. Thus apprehending, they went up to the holy Rṣi, and bowing to him entreated him with folded hands to be propitious.

Rather shouldst thou, being a lover of virtues, preserve both the realm of that king and thy own righteousness. In reply to this, the Bodhisattva comforted them: Do not fear, he said, sirs.

Its bottom. was hidden under manifold kinds of shrubs and trees and grasses. It was beset with mountain-ridges and plateaus that made the effect, as if they were detained there by the charming beauty of the forest and would not long for another place.

First of all, there is in this direction no road leading to any country; nor is it likely a hunting-party should have crossed a wilderness so large as this. Still less can there be question of an attempt to catch my fellow-elephants, on account of the heavy toil with which it would be attended..

On hearing him utter in a human voice these words not only indicative of a peaceful disposition, but of the desire to succour, the men recovered their confidence, and the whole assembly bowed to him.

bodhisattvaḥ kilānyatamasminnaraṇyapradeśe paṅkasaṃparkātparuṣavapurnīlameghaviccheda iva pādacāri vanamahiṣavṛṣo babhūva /	The Bodhisattva, it is said, one time lived in some forest-region as a wild buffalo-bull of grim appearance, owing to his being dirty with mud, and so dark of complexion that he resembled a moving piece of a dark-blue cloud.
sa tasyāṃ durlabhadharmasaṃjñāyāṃ saṃmohabahulāyāmapi tiryaggatau vartamānaḥ paṭuvijñānatvānna dharmacaryānirudyogamatirbabhūva /	Nevertheless, though in that animal-state, in which there prevails complete ignorance and it is difficult to come to the conception of righteousness, he in consequence of his keen understanding, was exerting himself to practise righteousness.
cirānuvṛttyeva nibaddhabhāvā na taṃ kadācitkaruṇā mumoca /	Compassion, as if it had a deep-rooted affection for him in return for his long service, never left him.
ko 'pi prabhāvaḥ sa tu karmaṇo vā tasyaiva vā yatsa tathā babhūva //	But some power too, either of his karma or his nature, must be taken into account to explain the fact that he was so.
ataśca nūnaṃ bhagavānovācadacintyatāṃ karmavipākayukteḥ / kṛtpātmakaḥ sannapi yatsa bheje tiryaggatiṃ tatra ca dharmasaṃjñām //	And it is for this reason, in truth, that the Lord declared the mystery of the result of karma to be inscrutable, since He, though compassion was at the bottom of his nature, obtained the state of a beast, yet even in this condition retained his knowledge of righteousness.
vinā na karmāsti gatiprabandhaḥ śubhaṃ na cāniṣṭavipākamasti /	Without karma the series of existences cannot be; it is also an impossibility that good actions should have evil as their result.
sa dharmasaṃjñī pi tu karmaleśāṃstāṃstān samāsādya tathā tathāsīt //	But it must be the influence of small portions of (evil) karma that caused him now and then, notwithstanding his knowledge of righteousness, to be in such (low) states.
athānyatamo duṣṭavānāstasya kālāntarābhivyaktāṃ prakṛtibhadratāṃ dayānuvṛttyā ca vigatakrodhasaṃrambhatāmavetya nāsmādbhayamastīti taṃ mahāsattvaṃ tena tena vihiṃsākrameṇa bhṛśataramabādhata /	Now some wicked monkey, knowing his natural goodness which had manifested itself in course of time, and understanding from his habitual mercy that anger and wrath had no power over him, was in the habit of vexing the Great Being very much by different injuries. From him have nothing to fear, so he thought.
dayāmṛduṣu durjanaḥ paṭutarāvalepodbhavaḥ	rascal is never more eager to insult and never displays greater insolence than towards people meek and merciful.
parāṃ vrajati vikriyāṃ na hi bhayaṃ tataḥ paśyati /	Against those he performs his worst tricks, for he sees no danger from their side.
yatastu bhayaśaṅkayā sukṛśayāpi saṃspṛśyate vinīta iva nīcakaiścarati tatra śāntoddhavaḥ //	But with respect to those from whence a suspicion of danger, however slight, strikes him, he will behave, oh! so modestly, like an honest man; his petulance is quieted there.
sa kadācittasya mahāsattvasya visrabdhaprasuptasya nidrāvaśādvā pracalāyataḥ sahasaivopari nipatati sma /	Sometimes, then, while the Great Being was calmly asleep or nodding from drowsiness, that monkey would of a sudden leap upon his back.
drumamiva kadācidenamadhiruhya bhṛśaṃ saṃcālayāmāsa /	Another time, having climbed on (his head), as if he were a tree, he swung repeatedly (between his horns).
kṣudhitasyāpi kadācidasya mārgamāvṛtya vyatiṣṭhata /	Sometimes again, when he was hungry, he would stand before his feet, obstructing his grazing.
kāṣṭheṇāpyenamekadā śravaṇayorghaṭṭayāmāsa /	It happened also now and then that he rubbed his ears with a log.
apyenamadhiruhya samudyatadaṇḍaḥ prasahyaiva vāhayan yamasya līlāmanucakāra /	Or having mounted on his back, he would ride him perforce, and holding a stick in his hand counterfeit Yama.
bodhisattvo 'pi mahāsattvaḥ sarvaṃ tadasyāvinayaceṣṭitamupakāramiva manyamāno niḥsaṃkṣobhasaṃrambhamanyurmarṣayāmāsa /	And the Bodhisattva, that Great Being, bore all that unbecoming behaviour of the monkey without irritation and anger, quite untroubled, for he considered it a benefit, as it were.
svabhāva eva pāpānāṃ vinayonmārgasaṃśrayaḥ / abhyāsāttatra ca satāmupakāra ivā kṣamā //	It is the very nature of the wicked, indeed, to walk aside from the way of decent behaviour, whereas forbearance is something like a benefit to the virtuous, owing to their habitual practice of going that way.
atha kilānyatamo yakṣastamasya paribhavamamṛṣyamāṇo bhāvaṃ vā jijñāsamānastasya mahāsattvasya tena duṣṭakapinā vāhyamānaṃ taṃ mahiṣavṛṣabhaṃ mārge sthitvedamuvāca-mā tāvadbhoḥ / kiṃ parikrīto 'syanena duṣṭakapinā? atha dyūte parājitaḥ? utāho bhayamasmākiṃcidāśaṅkase ? utāho balamatmagataṃ nāveṣi yadevamanena paribhūya vāhyase? nanu bhoḥ /	Now of a truth, some Yakṣa who was scandalised at those insults of the Great Being, or perhaps wished to try his nature, one time when the wicked monkey was riding the buffalo-bull, placed himself in his way, saying: Be not so patient. Art thou the slave of that wicked monkey by purchase or by loss at play, or dost thou suspect any danger from his part, or dost thou not know thine own strength, that thou sufferest thyself to be so abused by him as to become his riding animal? Verily, my friend,.
vegāviddhaṃ tvadviṣāṇāgravajraṃ vajraṃ bhindyādvajravadvā nagendrān / pādāśceme roṣasaṃrambhamuktā majjeyuste paṅkavacchailapṛṣṭhe //	The thunderbolt of thy pointed horns swung with swiftness could pierce a diamond, or like the thunderbolt, cleave huge trees. And these thy feet treading with furious anger, would sink in the mountain rock as in mud.
idaṃ ca śailopamasaṃhatasthiraṃ samagraśobhaṃ balasaṃpadā vapuḥ / svabhāvasaujaskasnirīkṣitorjitaṃ durāsadaṃ kesariṇo 'pi te bhavet //	And this body of thine is, like a rock, solid and compact, the splendid strength of its muscles makes its beauty perfect. So thy power is well-known to the vigorous by nature, and thou wouldst be hard to approach even for a lion.
mathāna dhṛtvā tadimaṃ skṣureṇa vā viṣāṇakoṭyā madamasya voddhara /	Therefore, either crush him with thy hoof by an energetic effort, or destroy his insolence with the sharp edges of thy horns.
kimasya jālamasya kaperaśaktavatprabādhanāduḥkhamidaṃ titikṣase //	Why dost thou suffer this rogue of a monkey to torment thee and to cause pain to thee, as if thou wert powerless?.
asajjanaḥ kutra yathā cikitsyate guṇānuvṛttyā sukhaśīlassaumyayā / kaṭūṣṇarūkṣāṇi hi yatra siddhaye kaphātmako roga iva prasarpati // atha bodhisattvastaṃ yakṣamavekṣamāṇaḥ kṣamākṣapatitamarūkṣākṣaramityuvāca-	Where is it ever seen that an evildoer is brought to reason by a cure consisting in a virtuous behaviour towards him, modesty, and kindness? This treatment being applied to such a one who is to be cured by pungent and burning and harsh remedies, his insolence will wax like a disease arising from the phlegm. Then the Bodhisattva looking at the Yakṣa spoke to him mild words expressive of his adherence to the virtue of forbearance.
avaimyenaṃ calaṃ nūnaṃ sadā cāvinaye ratam / ata eva mayā tvasya yuktaṃ marṣayituṃ nanu //	Surely, know him a fickle-minded one and always fond of iniquity, but for this very reason it is right, in truth, that put up with him.
pratikartumaśaktasya kṣamā kā hi balīyasi / vinayācāradhīreṣu kṣantavyaṃ kiṃ ca sādhuṣu //	What forbearance is that, practised towards somebody of greater strength, against whom it is impossible to retaliate? And with respect to virtuous people standing firm in honesty and decent behaviour, what is there to be endured at all? Indian medicine divides the diseases into three classes, according to their origin from one of the three humours: phlegm (kapha), wind (vāta), and bile (pitta)..
śakta eva titikṣate durbalaskhalitaṃ yataḥ /	Therefore we ought to endure injuries by a feeble one, though having the power of revenge.
varaṃ paribhavastasmānna guṇānāṃ parābhavaḥ //	Better to bear insults from such a one than to get rid of virtues.
asatkriyā hīnabalācca nāma nirdeśakālaḥ paramo guṇānām /	Ill-treatment by a powerless one is the best opportunity, in truth, for showing virtues.
guṇapriyastatra kimityapekṣya svadhairyabhedāya parākrameta //	With what purpose, then, should the lover of virtues make use of his strength in such cases so as to lose his firmness of mind?.
nityaṃ kṣamāyāśca nasnu kṣamāyāḥ kālaḥ parāyattatayā durāpaḥ / pareṇa tasminnupapādite ca tatraiva kopapraṇayakramaḥ kaḥ //	Besides, the opportunity for forbearance, that virtue always of use, being difficult to obtain inasmuch as it depends on others, what reason could there be to resort to anger just then, when that opportunity has been afforded by another?.
svāṃ dharmapīḍāmavicintya yo 'yaṃ matpāpaśuddhyarthamiva pravṛttaḥ / na cetkṣamāmapyahamatra kuryāmanyaḥ kṛtaghno bata kīdṛśaḥ syāt // yakṣa uvāca- tena hi na tvamasyāḥ kadāitprabādhanāyā mokṣyase-	And if did not use forbearance against him who disregarding the damage of his own righteousness (dharma), acts as if to cleanse my sins, say who else should be ungrateful, if not ? The Yakṣa spoke: Then wilt thou never be delivered from his persecutions.
guṇeṣvabahumānasya durjanasyāvinītatām / kṣamānaibhṛtyamatyaktvā kaḥ saṃkocayituṃ prabhuḥ // bodhisattva uvāca-	Who may be able to chastise the ill-behaviour of a rascal having no respect for virtues, unless he sets aside humble forbearance? The Bodhisattva spoke:.
parasya pīḍāpraṇayena yatsukhaṃ nivāraṇaṃ syādasukhodayasya vā / sukhārthinastanna niṣevituṃ kṣamaṃ na tadvipāko hi sukhaprasiddhaye //	It is not suitable for him who longs for happiness to pursue comfort or prevention of discomfort by inflicting grief on another. The result of such actions will not tend to the production of happiness..
kṣamāśrayādevamasau mayārthataḥ prabodhyamāno yadi nāvagacchati /	My persistence in patient endurance is, in fact, an admonition to awake his conscience.
nivārayiṣyanti ta enamutpathādamarṣiṇo yānayamabhyupaiṣyati // asatkriyāṃ prāpya cas tadvidhājjanānna mādṛśe 'pyevamasau kariṣyati /	If he does not understand it, he will afterwards assail others of a hasty temper who will stop him in his pursuit of the wrong way. And having been ill-treated by such a one, he will no more do these things to such as me.
na labdhadoṣo hi punastathācaredataśca muktirmama sā bhaviṣyati //	For having received punishment, he will not act in this (unbecoming) manner again.
atha yakṣastaṃ mahāsattvaṃ prasādavismayabahumānāvarjitamatiḥ sādhu sādhviti saśiraḥ prakampāṅgulivikṣepamabhisaṃrādhya tattatpriyamuvāca-	And so will get rid of him. On these words the Yakṣa, affected with faithful contentment, amazement, and respect, exclaimed: Well said! well said! and moving his head and shaking his (extended) fingers, magnified the Great Being with kind words such as these:.
kutastiraścāmiyamīdṛśī sthitirguṇeṣvasau cādaravistaraḥ kutaḥ / kayāpi buddhyā tvidamāsthito vapustapovane ko 'pi bhavāṃstapasyati // ityenamabhipraśasya taṃ cāsya duṣṭavānaraṃ pṛṣṭhādavadhūya samādiśya cāsya rakṣāvidhānaṃ tatraivāntardadhe //	How is it possible that beasts should possess a conduct like this? How didst thou come to this degree of regard for virtues? Having assumed with some purpose or other this animal-shape, thou must be somebody practising penance in the penance forest! After thus eulogising him, he threw the wicked monkey off his back, and taught him a preservative charm; after which he disappeared on the spot.
tadevaṃ sati kṣantavye kṣamā syānnāsatītyapakāriṇamapi sādhavo lābhamiva bahu manyante iti kṣāntikathāyāṃ vācyam /	In this manner, then, forbearance deserves this name only if there exists some opportunity for showing it, not otherwise: thus considering the virtuous apppreciate even their injurer, deeming him a profit. [So is to be said, when discoursing on forbearance.
evaṃ tiryaggatānāṃ bodhisattvānāṃ pratisaṃkhyānasauṣṭhavaṃ dṛṣṭam /	And this may also be said: In this manner is shown the imperturbable tranquillity of the Bodhisattvas, even when in the.
34 śatapatrajātakam / protsāhyamāno 'pi sādhurnālaṃ pāpe pravartitumanabhyāsāt /	, Fausböll, -) Even though provoked, a virtuous person is incapable of betaking himself to wickedness, having never learnt to do so.
tadyathānuśrūyate-	This will be taught as follows.
bodhisattvaḥ kilānyatamasmin vanapradeśe nānāvidharāgaruciracitrapatraḥ śatapatro babhūva /	The Bodhisattva, it is said, lived in some place of a forest as a woodpecker distinguished by his beautiful and lovely feathers of manifold colours.
karuṇāparicayācca tadavastho 'pi na prāṇihiṃsākaluṣāṃ śatapatravṛttimanuvavarta /	But though in that state, owing to his habitual compassion, he did not follow the way of living of his kind, a sinful one since it involves injuries to living beings.
bālaiḥ pravālaiḥ sa mahīruhāṇāṃ puṣpādhivāsairmadhubhiśca hṛdyaḥ / phalaiśca nānārasagandhavarṇaiḥ saṃtoṣavṛttiṃ bibharāṃcakāra //	With the young shoots of the trees, with the sweet and delicious flavours of their flowers. and with their fruits of different hue, scent, and relish he kept such diet as was dictated by his contentment.
dharmaṃ parebhyaḥ pravadan yathārhamārtān yathāśakti samuddharaṃśca / nivārayaṃścāvinayādanāryānudbhāvayāmāsa parārthacaryām //	He manifested his care for the interests of others by preaching to others the precepts of righteousness on proper opportunities, by helping the distressed according to his power, and by preventing the base-minded from immodest actions.
iti paripālyamānastena mahāsattvena tasmin vanapradeśe sattvakāyaḥ sācāryaka iva bandhumāniva savaidya iva rājanvāniva sukhamabhyavardhata /	The whole multitude of animals in that part of the forest, being thus protected by the Great Being, thrived and were happy; for in him they possessed a teacher, as it were, a kinsman, a physician, a king.
sa sattvakāyo 'pi tathaiva tena saṃrakṣyamāṇo guṇavṛddhimāpa //	In the same degree as they, being well protected by the greatness of his mercy, increased in virtues, in the very same.
samabhigamya cainaṃ karuṇayā paricodyamānaḥ papraccha-kimidaṃ mṛgarāja ? bāḍhaṃ khalvakalyaśarīraṃ tvāṃ paśyāmi /	And drawing near to him, moved by compassion, he asked him: What is the matter, king of the quadrupeds? Thou art seriously ill, indeed, see.
dvipeṣu darpātirasānuvṛttyā javaprasaṅgādathavā mṛgeṣu / kṛtaṃ tavāsvāsthyamidaṃ śrameṇa vyādheṣuṇā vā rujayā kayācit //	Is this illness caused by exhaustion after indulging too much in boldness against elephants? or in excessive running after deer? or art thou hit with an arrow by a hunter? or has some disease seized thee?.
tadbrūhi vācyaṃ mayi cedidaṃ te yadeva vā kṛtyamihocyatāṃ tat /	Say then, what ails thee, if at least it may be told to me. Likewise tell me what may be done for thee in this case.
mamāsti yā mitragatā ca śaktistatsādhyasaukhyasya bhavān sukhī ca // siṃha uvāca-sādho pakṣivara na me śramajātamidamasvāsthyaṃ rujayā vyādheṣuṇā vā /	And if perhaps possess some power for the benefit of my friends, thou must enjoy the profit may bring about by it and recover thy health. The lion spoke: Thou, virtuous and best of birds, this illness is not the effect of exhaustion nor is it caused by disease nor occasioned by a The point of this stanza is lost in translation.
idaṃ tvasthiśakalaṃ galāntare vilagnaṃ śalyamiva māṃ bhṛśaṃ dunoti /	But it is the fragment of a bone that sticks here in my throat and, like the point of an arrow, causes grievous pain to me.
na hyenacchaknomyabhyavahartumudgarituṃ vā /	can neither swallow it down nor throw it up.
tadeṣa kālaḥ suhṛdām /	Therefore, it is now the time of assistance by friends.
yathedānīṃ jānāsi, tathā māṃ sukhinaṃ kuruṣveti // atha bodhisattvaḥ paṭuvijñānatvādvicintya śalyoddharaṇopāyaṃ tadvadanaviṣkambhapramāṇaṃ kāṣṭhamādāya taṃ siṃhamuvāca-yā te śaktistayā samyak tāvatsvamukhaṃ nirvyādehīti /	Now, if you know the way to make me sound, well, do it. Then the Bodhisattva, owing to the keenness of his intellect, thought out some means of extracting the object which was the cause of his pain.
atha bodhisattvastadasya kāṣṭhaṃ dantapālyorantare samyagniveśya praviśya cāsya galamūlaṃ tattiryagavasthitamasthiśakalaṃ vadanāgreṇābhihṛtyaikasmin pradeśe samutpāditaśaithilyamitarrasmin parigṛhya paryante vicakarṣa / nirgacchanneva tattasya vadanaviṣkambhambhaṇakāṣṭhaṃ nipātayāmāsa /	Taking a piece of wood large enough to bar his mouth, he spoke to the lion: Open thy mouth as wide as ever thou canst. After he had done so, the Bodhisattva having placed the log tightly between the two rows of his teeth, entered the bottom of his throat. With the top of his beak he seized that fragment of bone sticking athwart in it by one edge, and having loosened it, took it by another edge, and at last drew it out. And while retiring, he dropped the log which barred the lion's mouth.
sudṛṣṭakarmā nipuṇo 'pi śalyahṛnna tatprayatnādapi śalyamuddharet / yadujjahārānabhiyogasiddhyā sa medhayā janmaśatānubaddhayā //	No wound-healer, however skilled in his art and clever, would have succeeded even with great effort in extracting that extraneous substance, yet he pulled it out, thanks to his keen intellect, though not exercised by professional training, but proper to him through hundreds of existences.
uddhṛtya śalyena sahaiva tasya duḥkhaṃ ca tatsaṃjanitāṃ śucaṃ ca / prītaḥ sa śalyoddharaṇādyathāsītprītaḥ saśalyoddharaṇāttathāsīt //	After taking away together with the bone the pain and anguish caused by it, he felt no less gladness at having relieved his suffering fellow-creature, than the lion at being released from the pain-causing object.
dharmatā hyeṣā sajjanasya /	This, indeed, is the essential property of a virtuous person.
prasādhya saukhyaṃ vyasanaṃ nivartya vā sahāpi duḥkhena parasya sajjanaḥ / upaiti tāṃ prītiviśeṣasaṃpadaṃ na yāṃ svasaukhyeṣu sukhāgateṣvapi //	virtuous person having effected the happiness of another or stopped his mischief even with difficulty, will enjoy a greater amount of excessive gladness, than he would on account even of prosperity happening to himself and easily obtained.
iti sa mahāsattvastasya tadduḥkhamupaśamayya prītahṛdayastamāmantrya siṃhaṃ pratinanditastena yatheṣṭaṃ jagāma //	So the Great Being having relieved his pain, was rejoiced in his heart. He took leave of the lion, and having received his thanks went his way.

Then he saw that same lion feasting on the flesh of a young antelope fresh killed. His mouth and claws and the lower end of his mane being tinged with the blood of that animal, he resembled a fragment of a cloud in autumn, immersed in the glow of twilight.
kṛtopakāro 'pi tu na prasehe vaktuṃ sa yācñāvirasākṣaraṃ tam / viśāradasyāpi hi tasya lajjā tatkālamaunavratamādideśa //	Yet, though he was his benefactor, he did not venture to address him with words of request, disagreeable to the ear; for however skilled in speech, shame imposed upon him a temporary obligation of silence.
kāryānurodhāttu tathāpi tasya cakṣuṣpathe hrīvidhuraṃ cacāra /	Nevertheless, as his wants required satisfaction, he walked up and down before his eyes in a bashful attitude.
sa cānupaśyannapi taṃ durātmā nimantraṇāmapyakaronna tasya //	But that scoundrel, though well aware of him, did not at all invite him to join in the repast.
śilātale bījamiva prakīrṇaṃ hutaṃ ca śāntoṣmaṇi bhasmapuñje / samaprakāraṃ phalayogakāle kṛtaṃ kṛtaghne vidule ca puṣpam //	Like seed sown on a rock, like an oblation poured out on ashes that have lost their heat, of that very nature is, at the time of fruit, a benefit bestowed on an ungrateful person, and the flower of the vidula-reed..
dayāklaibyaṃ na yo veda khādan visphurato mṛgān / praviśya tasya me vaktraṃ yajjīvasi na tadbahu //	Is it not enough that thou art alive, after entering the mouth of a creature like me, a devourer of fresh killed deer who does not know of unmanly mercy?.
māṃ punaḥ paribhūyaivamāsādayasi yācñayā /	Is it to insult me that thou darest molest me thus another time with a demand.
jīvitena tu khinno 'si paraṃ lokaṃ didṛkṣase // atha bodhisattvastena tasya rūkṣākṣarakrameṇa pratyākhyānavacasā samupajātavrīḍastatraiva namaḥ samutpapāta /	Art thou weary of thy life? Thou wishest to see the world hereafter, suppose. This refusal and the harsh words expressing it, filled the Bodhisattva with shame.
pakṣiṇo vayamityarthataḥ pakṣavisphāraṇaśabdenainamuktvā pracakrāma //	He flew directly upward to the sky, telling him in the language of his extended wings he was a bird, and went his way.
athānyatamā vanadevatā tasya tamasatkāramasahamānā dhairyaprayāmajijñāsayā vā samutpatya taṃ mahāsattvamuvāca-pakṣivara kasmādimamasatkāramasya durātmanaḥ kṛtopakāraḥ san saṃvidyasmānāyāṃ śaktāvapi marṣayasi ? kor 'thaḥ kṛtaghnenānenaivamupekṣitena ?	Now some forest-deity who was indignant at this injury, or who wanted to know the extent of his virtuous constancy, mounted also to the sky, and said to the Great Being: Excellent one among birds, for what reason dost thou suffer this injury inflicted by that scoundrel on.
dvisphūrjitaḥ pramathituṃ balaśālino 'pi /	He may be ever so strong, thou art still able to blind him by a sudden assault on his face.

At that moment the Bodhisattva, though having been ill-treated and insulted, and notwithstanding the provocation of the forest-deity, manifested the extreme goodness of his nature, saying: Enough, enough of this manner of proceeding.
naiṣa mārgo 'smadvidhānām /	This way is not followed by such as me.
ārte pravṛttiḥ sādhūnāṃ kṛpayā na tu lipsayā / tāmavaitu paro mā vā tatra kopasya ko vidhiḥ //	It is out of mercy, not with the desire of gain, that the virtuous take care of a person in distress, nor do they mind whether the other understands this or not.
vañcanā sā ca tasyaiva yanna vetti kṛtaṃ paraḥ /	Ingratitude cannot but tend to the deception of the ungrateful one himself.
ko hi pratyupakārārthī tasya bhūyaḥ kariṣyati //	Who, indeed, wishing a service in return, will do good to him a second time?.
upakartā tu dharmeṇa paratastatphalena ca / yogamāyāti niyamādihāpi yaśasaḥ śriyā //	As to the benefactor, he obtains merit and the result of it in the world hereafter in consequence of his self-restraint, and an illustrious renown still in this world.
kṛtaśceddharma ityeva kastatrānuśayaḥ punaḥ / atha pratyupakārārthamṛṇadānaṃ na tatkṛtam // upakṛtaṃ kila vetti na me parastadapakāramiti prakaroti yaḥ /	Moreover, if the benefit has been performed in order to practise a righteous action, why should it be regretted afterwards? If done with the purpose of receiving something in return, it is a loan, not a benefit..
nanu viśodhya guṇaiḥ sa yaśastanuṃ dviradavṛttimabhipratipadyate //	He who because of the ingratitude of his neighbour prepares to do him harm, such a one, in truth, after first earning a spotless reputation by his virtues, will subsequently act after the manner of elephants.
na vetti cedupakṛtamāturaḥ paro na yokṣyate 'pi sa guṇakāntayā śriyā / sacetasaḥ punaratha ko bhavetkramaḥ samucchritaṃ pramathitumātmano yaśaḥ // idaṃ tvatra me yuktarūpaṃ pratibhāti /	If my neighbour by the infirmity of his mind does not know how to return the benefit, he will also never obtain the lovely lustre inherent in virtues; but, say, what reason should there exist for a sentient being to destroy, on account of that, his own lofty renown? But this seems to me most becoming in this case.
yasmin sādhūpacīrṇe 'pi mitradharmo na lakṣyate / aniṣṭhuramasaṃrabdhamapayāyācchanaistataḥ // atha sā devatā tatsubhāṣitaprasāditamanāḥ sādhu sādhviti punaruktamabhipraśasya tattatpriyamuvāca-	He in whose heart a service done by a virtuous person did not rouse a friendly disposition, such a one is to be left, but gently, without harshness and anger. Then the deity, rejoiced at his well-said sentences, praised him, exclaiming repeatedly: Well said! well said! and adding many kind words.
ṛte jaṭāvalkaladhāraṇaśramādbhavānṛṣistvaṃ viditāyatiryatiḥ / na veṣamātraṃ hi munitvasiddhaye guṇairupetastviha tattvato muniḥ // ityabhilakṣya pratipūjyainaṃ tatraivāntardadhe //	Though exempt from the toil caused by matted hair and a bark garment, thou art a Rși, thou art a holy ascetic knowing the future! It is not the dress, truly, that makes the Muni, but he who is adorned by virtues is the real Muni here. After thus distinguishing him and honouring him, he disappeared on the spot.
evaṃ kṣāntikathāyāmapyupaneyam-evaṃ kṣamāparicayānna vairabahulo bhavati, nāvadyabahulo bahujanapriyo manojñaśceti /	In this manner, then, a virtuous person is incapable of betaking himself to wickedness, even though provoked, having never learnt to do so.
kṛtiriyamāryaśūrapādānām //	[So is to be said when eulogising the virtuous..
