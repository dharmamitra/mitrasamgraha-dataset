The phrensied sage, taking from his head the garland of flowers, amidst which the bees collected ambrosia, threw it to the king of the gods, who caught it, and suspended it on the brow of Airāvata, where it shone like the river Jāhnavī, glittering on the dark summit of the mountain Kailāsa.
madāndhakāritākṣosau gandhākṛṣṭena vāraṇaḥ / kareṇāghrāya cikṣepa tāṃ srajaṃ dharaṇītale //	The elephant, whose eyes were dim with inebriety, and attracted by the smell, took hold of the garland with his trunk, and cast it on the earth.

prasāda iti noktaṃ te praṇipātapuraḥ saram / harṣotphullakapolena na cāpi śirasā dhṛtā //	Thou hast not acknowledged it as a largess thou hast not bowed thyself before me thou hast not placed the wreath upon thy head, with thy countenance expanding with delight.

Thou confoundest me, Śakra, with other Brahmans, and hence I have suffered disrespect from thy arrogance but in like manner as thou hast cast the garland I gave thee down on the ground, so shall thy dominion over the universe be whelmed in ruin.
yasya saṃjātakopasya bhayameti carācaram / taṃ tvaṃ māmatigarveṇa devarājavamanyase //	Thou hast offended one whose wrath is dreaded by all created things, king of the gods, even me, by thine excessive pride.”

How can those abandoned by prosperity be possessed of energy and without energy, where is excellence? Without excellence there can be no vigour nor heroism amongst men he who has neither courage nor strength, will be spurned by all and he who is universally treated with disgrace, must suffer abasement of his intellectual faculties.

They engaged in war with the feeble and unfortunate divinities and Indra and the rest, being overcome in fight, fled for refuge to Brahmā, preceded by the god of flame Hutāśana.

The king of the gods sent the nymph Pramlocā to disturb his penance, and the sweetsmiling damsel diverted the sage from his devotions.
kṣobhitaḥ sa tayā sārdhaṃ varṣāṇāmadhikaṃ śatam / atiṣṭhanmandaradroṇyāṃ viṣayāsaktamānasaḥ //	They lived together, in the valley of Mandara, for a hundred and fifty years during which, the mind of the Muni was wholly given up to enjoyment.

punargate varṣaśate sādhika sā śubhānanā / yāmītyāha divaṃ brahmanpraṇayasmitaśobhanam //	Then again she preferred her suit to be allowed to return to the abodes of the gods and again the Muni desired her to remain.

ekadā tu tvarāyukto niścakrāmoṭajānmuniḥ / niṣkrāmantaṃ ca kutreti gamyate prāha sā śubhā //	“On one occasion the sage was going forth from their cottage in a great hurry. The nymph asked him where he was going.

All the austerities that would have led to acquisition of the wisdom of the Vedas have been rendered of no avail by passion that is the road to hell.’ The pious sage, having thus reviled himself, turned to the nymph, who was sitting nigh, and said to her, ‘Go, deceitful girl, whither thou wilt thou hast performed the office assigned thee by the monarch of the gods, of disturbing my penance by thy fascinations.
na tvāṃ karoṇyahaṃ bhasma krodhatīvreṇa vahninā / satāṃ saptapadaṃ maitrumuṣi tohaṃ tvayā saha //	I will not reduce thee to ashes by the fire of my wrath. Seven paces together is sufficient for the friendship of the virtuous, but thou and I have dwelt together.

Then the priests went to Prahlāda, and, having repeated the hymns of the SāmaVeda, said to him, as he respectfully hearkened, “Thou hast been born, prince, in the family of Brahmā, celebrated in the three worlds, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, the king of the Daityas why shouldest thou acknowledge dependance upon the gods? why upon the eternal?

pitā gururna sandehaḥ pūjanīyaḥ pūyatnataḥ / tatrāpi nāparādhyāmītyevaṃ manasi se sthitam //	There is no error, not the least, in what you have said, ‘that a father is the most venerable of all holy teachers’ he is a venerable instructor, no doubt, and is ever to be devoutly reverenced.

What need of the eternal? admirable! most worthy of you who are my venerable preceptors! Hear what need there is of the eternal, if to hearken will not give you pain.

You are my venerable preceptors, and, speak ye good or evil, it is not for my weak judgment to decide.” The priests said to him, “We preserved you, boy, when you were about to be consumed by fire, confiding that you would no longer eulogize your fathers foes we knew not how unwise you were but if you will not desist from this infatuation at our advice, we shall even proceed to perform the rites that will inevitably destroy you.” To this menace, Prahlāda answered, “What living creature slays, or is slain? what living creature preserves, or is preserved? Each is his own destroyer or preserver, as he follows evil or good.”

Love, then, for all creatures will be assiduously cerished by all those who are wise in the knowledge that Hari is all things.”
iti śrutvā sa daityendraḥ prāsādaśikhare sthitaḥ / krodhāndhakāritamukhaḥ prāha daiteyakiṅkarān // hiraṇyakaśipur uvāca durātmā kṣipyatāmasmātprāsādācchatayojanāt / giripṛṣṭhe patatvasmin śilābhinnāṅgasaṃhatiḥ //	When he had thus spoken, the Daitya monarch, his face darkened with fury, commanded his attendants to cast his son from the summit of the palace where he was sitting, and which was many Yojanas in height, down upon the tops of the mountains, where his body should be dashed to pieces against the rocks.

The divine Viṣṇu is in thee, father, in me, and in all every where else and hence how can I speak of friend or foe, as distinct from myself? It is therefore waste of time to cultivate such tedious and unprofitable sciences, which are but false knowledge, and all our energies should be dedicated to the acquirement of true wisdom.
vidyābuddhiravidyāyāmajñānāntāta jāyate / bālo 'gniṃ kiṃ na khadyotam asureśvara manyate //	The notion that ignorance is knowledge arises, father, from ignorance. Does not the child, king of the Asuras, imagine the firefly to be a spark of fire.

The excellent Muni granted his wife the great gift she had solicited, but with one condition “You shall bear a son,” he said, “who shall slay Indra, if with thoughts wholly pious, and person entirely pure, you carefully carry the babe in your womb for a hundred years.” Having thus said, Kaśyapa departed and the dame conceived, and during gestation assiduously observed the rules of mental and personal purity.

Diti retired one night to rest without performing the prescribed ablution of her feet, and fell asleep on which the thunderer divided with his thunderbolt the embryo in her womb into seven portions.

They derived this appellation from the words with which Indra had addressed them Mā rodīh, ‘Weep not’ and they became fortynine subordinate divinities, the associates of the wielder of the thunderbolt.

The second sort is the knowledge that is to be acquired by the Yogi whose end is escape from suffering, or eternal felicity. The third kind is the ascertainment of the identity of the end and the means, the rejection of the notion of duality.
jñānatrayasya vai tasya viśeṣo yo mahāmune / tannirākaraṇadvārā darśitātmasvarūpavat //	The last kind is the removal of whatever differences may have been conceived by the three first varieties of knowledge, and the consequent contemplation of the true essence of soul.
nirvyāpāramanākhyeyaṃ vyāptimātramanūpamam / ātmasambodhaviṣayaṃ sattāmātramalakṣaṇam // praśāntamabhayaṃ śuddhaṃ durvibhāvyamasaṃśrayam / viṣṇorjñānamayasyoktaṃ tajjñānaṃ brahmasaṃjñitam //	The supreme condition of Viṣṇu, who is one with wisdom, is the knowledge of truth which requires no exercise which is not to be taught which is internally diffused which is unequalled the object of which is selfillumination which is simply existent, and is not to be defined which is tranquil, fearless, pure which is not the theme of reasoning which stands in need of no support.
tatra jñānanirodhena yogino yānti ye layam / saṃsārakarṣaṇoptau te yānti nirbījatāṃ dvijā //	Those Yogis who, by the annihilation of ignorance, are resolved into this fourfold Brahma, lose the seminal property, and can no longer germinate in the ploughed field of worldly existence.
evaṃprakāramamalaṃ nityaṃ vyāpakamakṣayam / samastaheyarahitaṃ viṣṇvākhyaṃ paramaṃ padam // tadbrahma paramaṃ yogī yato nāvartate punaḥ / śrayatyapuṇyoparame kṣīṇakleśe 'tinirmale //	This is the supreme condition, that is called Viṣṇu, perfect, perpetual, universal, undecaying, entire, and uniform and the Yogi who attains this supreme spirit Brahma returns not to life again for there he is freed from the distinction of virtue and vice, from suffering, and from soil.
dve rūpe brahmaṇastasya mūrta cāmūrtameva ca / kṣarākṣarāsvarūpe te sarvabhūteṣvavasthite //	There are two states of this Brahma one with, and one without shape one perishable, and one imperishable which are inherent in all beings.
akṣaraṃ tatparaṃ brahma kṣaraṃ sarvamidaṃ jagat / ekadeśasthitasyāgnerjyotstrā vistāriṇi yathā / parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktistathodamakhilaṃ jagat // tatrāpyāsannadūratvād bahutvasvalpatāmayaḥ / jyotsnābhedosti tacchaktestadvanmaitreya vidyate //	The imperishable is the supreme being the perishable is all the world. The blaze of fire burning on one spot diffuses light and heat around so the world is nothing more than the manifested energy of the supreme Brahma and inasmuch, Maitreya, as the light and heat are stronger or feebler as we are near to the fire, or far off from it, so the energy of the supreme is more or less intense in the beings that are less or more remote from him.
ba3hmaviṣṇuśivā brahmanpradhānā brahmaśaktayaḥ / tataś ca devā maitreya nyūnā dakṣādayastataḥ // tato manuṣyāḥ paśavau mṛgapakṣisarīsṛpāḥ / nyūnānyūnatarāścaiva vṛkṣagulmādayas tathā //	Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva are the most powerful energies of god next to them are the inferior deities, then the attendant spirits, then men, then animals, birds, insects, vegetables each becoming more and more feeble as they are farther from their primitive source.
tadetadakṣaraṃ nityaṃ jaganmunivarākhitam / āvirbhāvatirobhāvajanmanāśavikalpavat //	In this way, illustrious Brahman, this whole world, although in essence imperishable and eternal, appears and disappears, as if it was subject to birth and death.
sarvaśakti mayo viṣṇuḥ svarūpaṃ brahmaṇaḥ param / mūrtaṃ yadyogibhiḥ purvaṃ yogārambheṣu cintyate // sālambano mahāyogaḥ sabījo yatrasaṃsthitaḥ / manasyavyāhate samyagyuñjatāṃ jāyate mune //	The supreme condition of Brahma, which is meditated by the Yogis in the commencement of their abstraction, as invested with form, is Viṣṇu, composed of all the divine energies, and the essence of Brahma, with whom the mystic union that is sought, and which is accompanied by suitable elements, is effected by the devotee whose whole mind is addressed to that object.
sa paraḥ paraśaktīnāṃ brahmaṇaḥ samanantaram / mūrtaṃ brahma mahābhāga sarvabrahmamayo hariḥ // yatra sarvamidaṃ protamotaṃ caivākhitaṃ jagat / tato jagajjagatyasminsa jagaccakhilaṃ mune // kṣarākṣaramayo viṣṇurbibhartyakhilamīśvaraḥ / puruṣāvyākṛtamayaṃ bhūṣaṇāstrasvarūpavat //	This Hari, who is the most immediate of all the energies of Brahma, is his embodied shape, composed entirely of his essence and in him therefore is the whole world interwoven and from him, and in him, is the universe and he, the supreme lord of all, comprising all that is perishable and imperishable, bears upon him all material and spiritual existence, identified in nature with his ornaments and weapons.

ahorātravyavasthānakāraṇaṃ bhagavānraviḥ / devayānaḥ paraḥ panthā yogināṃ kleśasaṃkṣaye //	He causes the difference between day and night, and is the divine vehicle and path of the sages who have overcome the inflictions of the world.
divasasya varirmadhye sarvākālaṃ vyavasthitaḥ / sarvadvīpeṣu maitreya niśārdhasya ca sanmukhaḥ // udayāstamane caiva sarvakālaṃ tu saṃmukhe / vidiśāsu tvaśeṣāsu tathā brahman diśāsu ca //	Whilst the sun, who is the discriminator of all hours, shines in one continent in midday, in the opposite Dvīpas, Maitreya, it will be midnight rising and setting are at all seasons, and are always relatively opposed in the different cardinal and intermediate points of the horizon.
yair yatra dṛśyate bhāsvānsa teṣāmudayaḥ smṛtaḥ / tirobhāvaṃ ca yatraiti tatraivāstamanaṃ raveḥ //	When the sun becomes visible to any people, to them he is said to rise when he disappears from their view, that is called his setting.
naivāstamanamarkasya nodayaḥ sarvadā sataḥ / udayāstamanākhyaṃ hi darśanādarśanaṃ raveḥ //	There is in truth neither rising nor setting of the sun, for he is always and these terms merely imply his presence and his disappearance.

udayāstamanābhyāṃ ca smṛte pūrvāpare diśau / yāvatpurastāttapati tāvatpṛṣṭhe ca pārśvayoḥ // ṛte 'maragirermerorupari brahmaṇaḥ sabhām / yeye marīcayorkasya prayānti brahmaṇaḥ sabhām / tete nirastāstadbhāsā pratīpamupayānti vai // tasmāddiśyuttarasyāṃ vai divārātriḥ sadaiva hi / sarveṣāṃ dvīpavarṣāṇāṃ seruruttarato yataḥ //	The east and west quarters are so called from the suns rising and setting there. As far as the sun shines in front, so far he shines behind and on either hand, illuminating all places except the summit of Meru, the mountain of the immortals for when his rays reach the court of Brahmā, which is there situated, they are repelled and driven back by the overpowering radiance which there prevails consequently there is always the alternation of day and night, according as the divisions of the continent lie in the northern or southern quarter, or inasmuch as they are situated north or south of Meru.

When the sun has travelled in the centre of Puṣkara a thirtieth part of the circumference of the globe, his course is equal in time to one Muhūrtta and whirling round like the circumference of the wheel of a potter, he distributes day and night upon the earth.
ayanasyottarasyādau makaraṃ yāti bhāskaraḥ / tataḥ kumbhaṃ ca mīnaṃ ca rāśe rāśyantaraṃ dvija // triṣveteṣvatha bhukteṣu tato vaiṣuvatīṃ gatim / prayāti savitā kurvannahorātraṃ tataḥ samam //	In the commencement of his northern course, the sun passes to Capricornus, thence to Aquarius, thence to Pisces, going successively from one sign of the Zodiac to another.

kulālacakraparyanto yathāśīghraṃ pravartate / dakṣiṇaprakrame sūryas tathā śīghraṃ pravartate // ativegitayā kālaṃ vāyuvegabalāccaran / tasmātprakaṣṭāṃ bhūmiṃ tu kālenālpena gacchati //	As the circumference of a potters wheel revolves most rapidly, so the sun travels rapidly on his southern journey he flies along his path with the velocity of wind, and traverses a great distance in a short time.
sūryo dvādaśabhiḥ śaighryān muhūrte dakṣiṇāyane / trayodaśārdhamṛkṣāṇāmahnā tu carati dvija / muhūrtais tāvadṛkṣāṇi naktamaṣṭādaśaiś caran //	In twelve Muhūrttas he passes through thirteen lunar asterisms and a half during the day and during the night he passes through the same distance, only in eighteen Muhūrttas.
kulālacakramadhyastho yathā mandaṃ prasarpati / tathodagayane sūryaḥ sarpate mandavikramaḥ // tasmāddīrgheṇa kālena bhūmimalpāṃ tu gaccati / aṣṭādaśasuhūrtaṃ yaduttarāyaṇapaścimam // aharbhavati taccāpi carate mandavikramaḥ // trayodaśārdhamahnā tu ṛkṣāṇāṃ carate raviḥ / muhūrtais tāvadṛkṣāṇi rātrau dvādaśabhiścaran //	As the centre of the potters wheel revolves more slowly than the circumference, so the sun in his northern path again revolves with less rapidity, and moves over a less space of the earth in a longer time, until, at the end of his northern route, the day is again eighteen Muhūrttas, and the night twelve the sun passing through half the lunar mansions by day and by night in those periods respectively.
ato mandataraṃ nābhyāṃ cakraṃ bhramati vai yathā / mṛtpiṇḍa iva madhyastho dhruvo bhramati vai tathā // kulālacakranābhis tu yathā tatraivavartate / dhruvas tathā hi maitreya tatraiva parivartate //	As the lump of clay on the centre of the potters wheel moves most slowly, so the polarstar, which is in the centre of the zodiacal wheel, revolves very tardily, and ever remains in the centre, as the clay continues in the centre of the wheel of the potter.
ubhayoḥ kāṣṭhayormadhye bhramato maṇḍalāni tu / divā naktaṃ ca sūryasya mandā śīghrāca vai gatiḥ //	The relative length of the day or night depends upon the greater or less velocity with which the sun revolves through the degrees between the two points of the horizon.
mandāhni yasminnayane śīghrā naktaṃ tadā gatiḥ / śīghrā niśi yadā cāsya tadā mandā divā gatiḥ //	In the solstitial period, in which his diurnal path is quickest, his nocturnal is slowest and in that in which he moves quick by night, he travels slowly by day.
eka pramāṇamevaiṣa mārgaṃ yāti divākaraḥ / ahorātreṇa yo bhuṅkte samastā rāśayo dvija // ṣaḍeva rāśīn yo bhuṅkte rātrāvanyāṃś ca ṣaḍdivā // rāśipramāṇajanitā dīrghahrasvātmatā dine / tathā niśāyāṃ rāśīnāṃ pramāṇair laghudīrghatā //	The extent of his journey is in either case the same for in the course of the day and night he passes through all the signs of the Zodiac, or six by night, and the same number by day the length and shortness of the day are measured by the extent of the signs and the duration of day and night by the period which the sun takes to pass through them.
dināderdirghahrasvatvaṃ tadbhogenaiva jāyate / uttare prakrame śīghrā niśi mandā gatirdivā //	In his northern declination the sun moves quickest by night, and slowest by day in his southern declination the reverse is the case.
uṣā rātriḥ samākhyātāvyuṣṭiścāpyucyate dinam / procyate ca tathā saṃdhyā uṣāvyuṣṭyoryadantaram //	The night is called Uṣā, and the day is denominated Vyuṣṭa, and the interval between them is called Sandhya.
saṃdhyākāle ca saṃprāpte raudre paramadāruṇe / mandehā rākṣasā ghorāḥ sūryamicchinti khāditum // prajāpatikṛtaḥ śāpasteṣāṃ maitreya rakṣasām / akṣayatvaṃ śarīrāṇāṃ maraṇaṃ ca dine dine // tataḥ sūryasya tair yuddhaṃ bhavatyatyantadāruṇam / tato dvijottamā stoyaṃ saṃkṣipanti mahāmune // oṅkārabrahmasaṃyuktaṃ gāyatryā cābhimantritam / tena dahyanti te pāpā vajrībhūtena vāriṇā //	On the occurrence of the awful Sandhya, the terrific fiends termed Mandehas attempt to devour the sun for Brahmā denounced this curse upon them, that, without the power to perish, they should die every day and revive by night, and therefore a fierce contest occurs daily between them and the sun. At this season pious Brahmans scatter water, purified by the mystical Omkāra, and consecrated by the Gāyatri and by this water, as by a thunderbolt, the foul fiends are consumed.
agnihotre hūyate yā samantrā prathamāhutiḥ / sūryojyotiḥ sahasrāṃśu samā dīpyati bhāskaraḥ //	When the first oblation is offered with solemn invocations in the morning rite, the thousandrayed deity shines forth with unclouded splendour.

vaiṣṇuvoṃśaḥ paraḥ sūryo yontarjyotirasaṃplavam / abhiyāyaka oṅkārastasya tatprerakaṃ param //	The sun is a principal part of Viṣṇu, and light is his immutable essence, the active manifestation of which is excited by the mystic syllable Om.
tena saṃpreritaṃ jyotir oṃkāreṇātha dīptimat / dahatyaśeṣarakṣāṃsi mandehākhyānyaghāni vai //	Light effused by the utterance of Omkāra becomes radiant, and burns up entirely the Rākṣasas called Mandehas.

yadambu vaiṣṇavaḥ kāyastato vipra vasundharā / padmākārā samudbhūtā parvatābdhyādisaṃyutā //	From the waters, which are the body of Viṣṇu, was produced the lotusshaped earth, with its seas and mountains.

yadā tu śuddhaṃ nijarūpi sarvaṃ karmakṣaye jñānamapāstadoṣam / tadā hi saṃkalpataroḥ phalāni bhavanti no vastuṣu vastubhedāḥ //	When knowledge is pure, real, universal, independent of works, and exempt from defect, then the varieties of substance, which are the fruit of the tree of desire, cease to exist in matter.

Where is the thing that is devoid of beginning, middle, and end, of one uniform nature? How can reality be predicated of that which is subject to change, and reassumes no more its original character? Earth is fabricated into a jar the jar is divided into two halves the halves are broken to pieces the pieces become dust the dust becomes atoms.
tasmān na vijñānam ṛte 'sti kiṃcit kvacit kadācid dvija vastujātam / vijñānam ekaṃ nijakarmabhedavibhinnacitter bahudhābhyupetam //	Hence, Brahman, except discriminative knowledge, there is nothing any where, or at any time, that is real. Such knowledge is but one, although it appear manifold, as diversified by the various consequences of our own acts.
jñānaṃ viśuddhaṃ vimalaṃ viśo kamaśeṣalobhādinirastasaṅgam / ekaṃ sadaikaṃ paramaḥ sa vāsudevo na yato 'nyadasti //	Knowledge perfect, pure, free from pain, and detaching the affections from all that causes affliction knowledge single and eternal—is the supreme Vāsudeva, besides whom there is nothing.

The great end of life has also been expounded by you, and the preeminence of holy knowledge.

yajñeśācyuta govinda mādhavānanta keśava / kṛṣṇa viṣṇo hṛṣīkeśa vāsudeva namostu te // iti rājāha bharato harernāmāni kevalam / nānyajjagāda maitreya kiñcitsvaprāntarepi ca / etatpadantadarthaṃ ca vinā nānyadacintayat //	The Rājā was ever repeating the names, Yajñeśa, Achyuta, Govinda, Mādhava, Ananta, Keśava, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, Hṛṣikeśa nothing else did be utter, even in his dreams nor upon anything but those names, and their import, did he ever meditate.
samitpuṣpakuśādānaṃ cakre devakriyākṛte / nānyāni cakre karmāṇi niḥsaṅgo yogatāpasaḥ //	He accepted fuel, flowers, and holy grass, for the worship of the deity, but performed no other religious rites, being engrossed by disinterested, abstract devotion.
jagāma sobhiṣekārthamekadā tu mahānadīm / sasnau tatra tadā cakre snānasyānantarakriyāḥ // athājagāma tattīraṃ jalaṃ pātuṃ pipāsitā / āsannaprasavā brahmannekaiva hariṇī vanāt // tataḥ samabhavattatra pītaprāye jale tathā / siṃhasya nādaḥ sumahānsarvaprāṇibhayaṅkaraḥ //	On one occasion he went to the Mahanadi, for the purpose of ablution he bathed there, and performed the ceremonies usual after bathing, Whilst thus occupied, there came to the same place a doe big with young, who had come out of the forest to drink of the stream. Whilst quenching her thirst, there was heard on a sudden the loud and fearful roaring of a lion on which the doe, being excessively alarmed, jumped out of the water upon the bank.
tataḥ sā sahasā trāsādāplutā nimnagātaṭam / atyuccārohaṇenāsyā nadyāṃ garbhaḥ papāta ha // tamūhyamānaṃ vegena vīcimālāpariplutam / jagrāha sa nṛpo garbhātpatitaṃ mṛgapotakam //	In consequence of this great leap, her fawn was suddenly brought forth, and fell into the river and the king, seeing it carried away by the current, caught hold of the young animal, and saved it from being drowned.
garbhapracyutidoṣeṇa prottuṅgākramaṇena ca / maitreya sāpi hariṇī papāta ca mamāra ca // hariṇīṃ tāṃ vilokyātha vipannāṃ tṛpatāpasaḥ / mṛgapotaṃ samādāya nijamāśramamāgataḥ //	The injury received by the deer, by her violent exertion, proved fatal, and she lay down, and died which being observed by the royal ascetic, he took the fawn in his arms, and returned with it to his hermitage there he fed it and tended it every day, and it throve and grew up under his care.
cacārāśramaparyante tṛṇāni gahaneṣu saḥ / dvaraṃ gatvā ca śārdulatrāsādabhyāyayau punaḥ // prātargatvātidūraṃ ca sāyamāyātyathāśramam / punaś ca bharatasyabhūdāśramasyoṭajājire //	It frolicked about the cell, and grazed upon the grass in its vicinity and whenever it strayed to a distance, and was alarmed at a wild beast, it ran back thither for safety. Every morning it sallied forth from home, and every evening returned to the thatched shelter of the leafy bower of Bharata.
tasya tasminmṛge dūrasamīpaparivartini / āsīccetaḥ samāsaktaṃ na yayāvanyato dvija //	Whilst the deer was thus the inmate of his hermitage, the mind of the king was ever anxious about the animal, now wandering away, and now returning to his side, and he was unable to think of anything else.
vimuktarājyatanayaḥ projjhitāśeṣabāndhavaḥ / mamatvaṃ sa cakāroccais tasminhariṇabālake //	He had relinquished his kingdom, his children, all his friends, and now indulged in selfish affection for a fawn.
kiṃ vṛkair bhakṣito vyaghraiḥ kiṃ siṃhena nipātitaḥ / cirāyamāṇe niṣkrānte tasyāsīditi mānasam //	When absent for a longer time than ordinary, he would fancy that it had been carried off by wolves, devoured by a tiger, or slain by a lion.
eṣā vasumatī tasya khurāgrakṣatakarburā //	“The earth,” he would exclaim, “is embrowned by the impressions of its hoofs.
prītaye mama jātosau kva mamaiṇakabālakaḥ / viṣāmāgroṇa madbāhuṃ kaṇḍūyanaparo hi saḥ / kṣemeṇābhyāgatoraṇyādapi māṃ sukhayiṣyati //	What has become of the young deer, that was born for my delight? How happy I should be if he had returned from the thicket, and I felt his budding antlers rubbing against my arm.
ete lūnaśikhāstasya daśanair acirodgataiḥ / kuśāḥ kāśā virājante baṭavaḥ sāmāgā iva // itthaṃ ciragate tasminsa cakre mānasaṃ muniḥ / prītiprasannavadanaḥ pārśvasthe cābhavanmṛge //	These tufts of sacred grass, of which the heads have been nibbled by his new teeth, look like pious lads chanting the Sāmaveda.” Thus the Muni meditated whenever the deer was long absent from him and contemplated him with a countenance animated with pleasure as he stood by his side.
samādhibhaṅgastasyāsīttanmayatvādṛtātmanaḥ / santyaktarājyabhogardhisvajanasyāpi bhūpateḥ //	His abstraction was interrupted, the spirit of the king being engrossed by the fawn, even though he had abandoned family, wealth, and dominion.
capalaṃ capale tasmindūragaṃ dūragāmini / mṛgapote 'bhavaccittaṃ stairyavattasya bhūpateḥ // kālena gacchatā so 'tha kālaṃ cakre mahīpatiḥ / piteva sāstraṃ putreṇa mṛgapotena vīkṣitaḥ // mṛgameva tadādrākṣīttyajanprāṇānasāvapi / tanmayatvena maitreya nānyatkiñcidacintayat //	The firmness of the princes mind became unsteady, and wandered with the wanderings of the young deer. In the course of time the king became subject to its influence. He died, watched by the deer, with tears in its eyes, like a son mourning for his father and he himself, as he expired, cast his eyes upon the animal, and thought of nothing else, being wholly occupied with one idea.
tataś ca tatkālakṛtāṃ bhāvanāṃ prāpya tādṛśīm / jambūmārge mahāraṇye jāto jātismaromṛgaḥ // jātismaratvadudvignaḥ saṃsārasya dvijottama / vihāya mātaraṃ bhūyaḥ sālagrāmamupāyayo //	In consequence of this predominant feeling at such a season, he was born again, in the Jambumārga forests, as a deer, with the faculty of recollecting his former life which recollection inspiring a distaste for the world, he left his mother, and again repaired to the holy place Śālagrāma.
śuṣkais tṛṇais tathā parṇaiḥ sa kurvann ātmapoṣaṇam / mṛgatvahetubhūtasya karmaṇo niṣkṛtiṃ yayau //	Subsisting there upon dry grass and leaves, he atoned for the acts which had led to his being born in such a condition and upon his death he was next born as a Brahman, still retaining the memory of his prior existence.
tatra cotsṛṣṭadeho 'sau jajñe jātismaro dvijaḥ / sadācāravatāṃśuddhe yogināṃ pravare kule //	He was born in a pious and eminent family of ascetics, who were rigid observers of devotional rites.
sarvavijñānasaṃpannaḥ sarvaśāstrarthatattvavit / apaśyatya ca maitreya ātmānaṃ prakṛteḥ param //	Possessed of all true wisdom, and acquainted with the essence of all sacred writings, he beheld soul as contradistinguished from matter Prakriti.
ātmano 'dhigatajñāno devādīni mahāmune / sarvabhūtānyabhedena sa dadarśa tadātmanaḥ //	Embued with knowledge of self, he beheld the gods and all other beings as in reality the same.
na papāṭha guruproktaṃ kṛtopanayanaḥ śrutim / na dadarśa ca karmāṇi śāstrāṇi jagṛhe na ca // uktopi bahuśaḥ kiñcijjaḍavākyamabhāṣata / tadapyasaṃskāraguṇaṃ grāmyavākyoktisaṃśritam //	It did not happen to him to undergo investiture with the Brahmanical thread, nor to read the Vedas with a spiritual preceptor, nor to perform ceremonies, nor to study the scriptures. Whenever spoken to, he replied incoherently and in ungrammatical and unpolished speech.
apadhvastavapuḥ so 'pi malināmbaragdvijaḥ / klinnadantāntaraḥ sarvaiḥ paribhūtaḥ sa nāgaraiḥ //	His person was unclean, and he was clad in dirty garments. Saliva dribbled from his mouth, and he was treated with contempt by all the people.
saṃmānanāparāṃ hāniṃ yogardhaḥ kurute yataḥ / janenāvamato yogī yogasiddhaṃ ca vindati //	Regard for the consideration of the world is fatal to the success of devotion. The ascetic who is despised of men attains the end of his abstractions.
tasmāccareta vai yogī satāṃ dharmamadūṣayan / janā yathā vamanyerangaccheyurnaiva saṅgatim //	Let therefore a holy man pursue the path of the righteous, without murmuring and though men contemn him, avoid association with mankind.
hiraṇyagarbhavacanaṃ vicintyetthaṃ mahāmatiḥ / ātmānaṃ darśayāmāsa jaḍonmattākṛtiṃ jane //	This, the counsel of Hiraṇyagarbha, did the Brahman call to mind, and hence assumed the appearance of a crazy ideot in the eyes of the world.
bhukte kulmāṣavāṭyādiśākaṃ vanyaṃ phalaṃ kaṇān / yadyadāpnoti subahu tadatte kālasaṃyamam //	His food was raw pulse, potherbs, wild fruit, and grains of corn. Whatever came in his way he ate, as part of a necessary, but temporary infliction.
pitaryuparate so 'tha bhrātṛbhrātṛvyabāndhavaiḥ / kāritaḥ kṣetrakarmādikadannāhārapoṣitaḥ // samākṣapīnāvayavo jaḍakārī ca karmaṇi / sarvalokopakaraṇaṃ babhūvāhāracetanaḥ //	Upon his fathers death he was set to work in the fields by his brothers and his nephews, and fed by them with vile food and as he was firm and stout of make, and a simpleton in outward act, he was the slave of every one that chose to employ him, receiving sustenance alone for his hire.
taṃ tādṛśamasaṃskāraṃ viprākṛtiviceṣṭitam / kṣattāsauvīrarājasya kālyai paśumakalpayat //	The head servant of the king of Sauvīra, looking upon him as an indolent, untaught Brahman, thought him a fit person to work without pay and took him into his masters service to assist in carrying the palankin.
sa rājā śibikārūḍho gantuṃ kṛtamatirdvija / babhūvekṣumatītīre kapilarṣer varāśramam // śreyaḥ kimatra saṃsāre duḥkhaprāye nṛṇāmiti / praṣṭuṃ taṃ mokṣadharmajñaṃ kapilākhyaṃ mahāmunim //	The king having ascended his litter, on one occasion, was proceeding to the hermitage of Kapila, on the banks of the Ikṣumatī river, to consult the sage, to whom the virtues leading to liberation were known, what was most desirable in a world abounding with care and sorrow.
gṛhīto viṣṭinā vipraḥ sarvajñānaikabhājanam / jātismarosau papāsya kṣayakāma uvāha tām // yayau jaḍamatiḥ sotha mṛgamātrāvalokanam / kurvanmatimatāṃ śraṣṭhastadanye tvaritaṃ yayuḥ //	Amongst those who by order of his head servant had been compelled gratuitously to carry the litter was the Brahman, who had been equally pressed into this duty, and who, endowed with the only universal knowledge, and remembering his former existence, bore the burden as the means of expiating the faults for which he was desirous to atone.
vilokya nṛpatiḥ sotha viṣamāṃ śibikāgatim / kimetadityāha samaṃ gamyatāṃ śibikāvahāḥ // punastathaiva śibikaṃ vilokya viṣamāṃ hi saḥ / nṛpaḥ kimetadityāha bhavadbhir gamyatenyathā // bhūpatervadatastasya śrutvetthaṃbahuśo vacaḥ / śibikāvāhakāḥ projurayaṃ yātītyasatvaram // rājovāca kiṃ śrintosyalpamadhvānaṃ tvayoḍhā śibikā mama / kimāyā sasaho na tvaṃ pīvānasi nirīkṣyase //	Fixing his eyes upon the pole, he went tardily along, whilst the other bearers moved with alacrity and the king, feeling the litter carried unevenly, called out, “Ho bearers! what is this? Keep equal pace together.” Still it proceeded unsteadily, and the Rājā again exclaimed, “What is this? how irregularly are you going!” When this had repeatedly occurred, the palankinbearers at last replied to the king, “It is this man, who lags in his pace.” “How is this?” said the prince to the Brahman, “are you weary? You have carried your burden but a little way are you unable to bear fatigue? and yet you look robust.” The Brahman answered and said, “It is not I who am robust, nor is it by me that your palankin is carried.
brāhmaṇa uvāca nāhaṃ pīvā na caivoḍhā śibikā bhavato mayā / na śrāntosmi na cāyāso soḍhavyosti mahīpate // rājovāca pratyakṣaṃ dṛśyase pīvānadyāpi śibikā tvayi / śramaś ca bhārodvahane bhavatyeva hi dehinām //	I am not wearied, prince, nor am I incapable of fatigue.” The king replied, “I clearly see that you are stout, and that the palankin is borne by you and the carriage of a burden is wearisome to all persons.” “First tell me,” said the Brahman, “what it is of me that you have clearly seen, and then you may distinguish my properties as strong or weak.
pratyakṣaṃ bhavatā bhūpa yaddṛṣṭaṃ mama tadvada / balavānabalaśceti vācyaṃ paścādviśeṣaṇam //	The assertion that you behold the palankin borne by me, or placed on me, is untrue. Listen, prince, to what I have to remark.
bhūmau pādayugaṃ tvāste jaṅghe pādadvaye sthite / ūrvorjaṅghādvayāvasthau tadādhāraṃ tathodaram // vakṣasthalaṃ tathā bāhū skandhau codarasaṃsthitau / skandhāśriteyaṃ śibikā mama bhārotra kiṃ kṛtaḥ // śibikāyāṃ sthitaṃ cedaṃ vapustvadupalakṣitam / tatra tvamahamapyatra projyate cedamanyathā //	The place of both the feet is the ground the legs are supported by the feet the thighs rest upon the legs and the belly reposes on the thighs the chest is supported by the belly and the arms and shoulders are propped up by the chest the palankin is borne upon the shoulders, and how can it be considered as my burden? This body which is seated in the palankin is defined as Thou thence what is elsewhere called This, is here distinguished as I and Thou.
ahaṃ tvaṃ ca tathānye ca bhūtair uhyāma parthiva / guṇapravāhapatito bhūtavargaupi yātyayam // karmavaśyā guṇaścaite sattvādyāḥ pṛthivīpate / avidyāsaṃcitaṃ karma taccāseṣeṣu jantuṣu //	I and thou and others are constructed of the elements and the elements, following the stream of qualities, assume a bodily shape but qualities, such as goodness and the rest, are dependant upon acts and acts, accumulated in ignorance, influence the condition of all beings.
ātmā śuddhokṣaraḥ śānto nirguṇaḥ prakṛteḥ paraḥ / pravṛddhyapacayau nāsya ekasyākhilajantuṣu //	The pure, imperishable soul, tranquil, void of qualities, preeminent over nature Prakriti, is one, without increase or diminution, in all bodies.
yadā nopacayastasya na caivāpacayo nṛpa / tadā pīvānasītītthaṃ kayā yuktyā tvayeritam // bhūpādajaṅghākaṭyūrujaṭharādiṣu saṃsthite / śibikeyaṃ yathā skandhe tathā bhāraḥ samastvayā //	But if it be equally exempt from increase or diminution, then with what propriety can you say to me, ‘I see that thou art robust?’ If the palankin rests on the shoulders, and they on the body the body on the feet, and the feet on the earth then is the burden borne as much by you as by me.
yadā puṃsaḥ sṛthagbhāvaḥ prākṛtaiḥ kāraṇernṛpa / soḍhavyastu tadāyāsaḥ kathaṃ vā nṛpate mayā //	When the nature of men is different, either in its essence or its cause, then may it be said that fatigue is to be undergone by me.
yaddravyā śibikā ceyaṃ taddravyo bhūtasaṃgrahaḥ / bhavato me 'kilasyāsya mamatvenopabṛṃhitaḥ //	That which is the substance of the palankin is the substance of you and me and all others, being an aggregate of elements, aggregated by individuality.”
evamuktvābhavanmaunī sa vahañchibikāṃ dvija / so 'pi rājāvatīryovyāṃ tatpādau jagṛhe tvaran // rājovāca bhobhovisṛjya śibikāṃ prasādaṃ kuru me dvijaḥ / kathyatāṃ ko bhavānatra jālmarūpadharaḥ sthitaḥ //	Having thus spoken, the Brahman was silent, and went on bearing the palankin but the king leaped out of it, and hastened to prostrate himself at his feet saying, “Have compassion on me, Brahman, and cast aside the palankin and tell me who thou art, thus disguised under the appearance of a fool.” The Brahman answered and said, “Hear me, Rāja,.
śrūyatāṃ sohamityetadvaktuṃ bhūpa na śakyate / upabhoganimittaṃ ca sarvatrāgamanakriyā // sukhaduḥkhopabhogau tu tau dehādyupapādakau / dharmādharmodbhavau bhoktuṃ janturdehādimṛcchati //	Who I am it is not possible to say arrival at any place is for the sake of fruition and enjoyment of pleasure, or endurance of pain, is the cause of the production of the body. A living being assumes a corporeal form to reap the results of virtue or vice.
sarvasyaiva hi bhūpāla jantoḥ sarvatra kāraṇam / dharmādharmau yataḥ kasmātkāraṇaṃ pṛcchate tvayā // rājovāca dharmādharmau na sandehaḥsarvakāryeṣu kāraṇam / upabhoganimittaṃ ca dehāddehāntarāgamaḥ // yastvetadbhavatā proktaṃ sohamityetadātmanaḥ / vaktuṃ na sakyate śrotuṃ tanmamecchā pravartate //	The universal cause of all living creatures is virtue or vice why therefore inquire the cause of my being the person I appear.” The king said, “Undoubtedly virtue and vice are the causes of all existent effects, and migration into several bodies is for the purpose of receiving their consequences but with respect to what you have asserted, that it is not possible for you to tell me who you are, that is a matter which I am desirous to hear explained.
yosti sohamiti brahmankathaṃ vaktuṃ na śakyate / ātmanyeṣa na doṣāya śabdohamiti yo dvija // brāhmaṇa uvāca śabdohamiti doṣāya nātmanyeṣa tathaiva tat / anātmanyātmavijñānaṃ śabdo vā bhrāntilakṣaṇaḥ //	How can it be impossible, Brahman, for any one to declare himself to be that which he is? There can be no detriment to onesself from applying to it the word I.” The Brahman said, "It is true that there is no wrong done to that which is onesself by the application to it of the word I but the term is characteristic of error, of conceiving that to be the self or soul which is not self or soul.
jihvā bravītyahamiti dantoṣṭhau tāluke nṛpa / etenāhaṃ yataḥ sarve vāṅniṣpādanahetavaḥ //	The tongue articulates the word I, aided by the lips, the teeth, and the palate and these are the origin of the expression, as they are the causes of the production of speech.
kiṃ hetubhir vadatyeṣā vāgevāhamiti svayam / ataḥ pīvānasītyetad vaktum itthaṃ na yujyate //	If by these instruments speech is able to utter the word I, it is nevertheless improper to assert that speech itself is I.

If another being is different specifically from me, most excellent monarch, then it may be said that this is I that is the other but when one only soul is dispersed in all bodies, it is then idle to say, Who are you? who am I? Thou art a king this is a palankin these are the bearers these the running footmen this is thy retinue yet it is untrue that all these are said to be thine.

What then? is it denominated either timber or a tree? People do not say that the king is perched upon a tree, nor that he is seated upon a piece of wood, when you have mounted your palankin. The vehicle is an assemblage of pieces of timber, artificially joined together judge, prince, for yourself in what the palankin differs really from the wood.
evaṃ chatraśalākānāṃ pṛthagbhāve vimṛśyatām / kva yātaṃ chatramityetannyāyastvayi tathā mayi //	Again contemplate the sticks of the umbrella, in their separate state. Where then is the umbrella? Apply this reasoning to thee and to me.

pumānna devo na naro na paśurna ca pādapaḥ / śarīrākṛtibhedāstu bhūpaite karmayonayaḥ //	Man is neither a god, nor a man, nor a brute, nor a tree these are mere varieties of shape, the effects of acts.

tvaṃ rājā sarvalokasya pituḥ putro ripo ripuḥ / patnyāḥ patiḥ pitā sūnoḥ kiṃ tvaṃ bhūpavadāmyaham //	Thou art called the monarch of the world the son of thy father the enemy of thy foes the husband of thy wife the father of thy children.

How art thou situated? Art thou the head or the belly? or are they thine? Art thou the feet? or do they belong to thee? Thou art, oh king, distinct in thy nature from all thy members! Now then, rightly understanding the question, think who I am and how it is possible for me, after the truth is ascertained of the identity of all, to recognise any distinction, or to speak of my own individuality by the expression I.

etadvivekavijñānaṃ yadaśeṣeṣu jantuṣu / bhavatā darśitaṃ vipratatparaṃ prakṛtermahat // nāhaṃ vahāmi śibikāṃ śivikā na mayi sthitā / śarīramanyadasmattau yoneyaṃ śibikā dhṛtā // guṇapravṛttyā bhūtānāṃ pravṛttiḥ karmacoditā / pravartante guṇā hyete kiṃ mameti tvayoditam //	You have shewn that to be discriminative wisdom which exists in all creatures, and which is the great principle that is distinct from plastic nature but the assertions—I do not bear the palankin—the palankin does not rest upon me—the body, by which the vehicle is conveyed, is different from me—the conditions of elementary beings are influenced by acts, through the influence of the qualities, and the qualities are the principles of action —what sort of positions are these.
etasminparamārthajña mama śrotrapathaṃ gate / mano vihvalatāmeti paramārthārthitāṃ gatam //	Upon these doctrines entering into my ears, my mind, which is anxious to investigate the truth, is lost in perplexity.

kapilarṣirbāgavataḥ sarvabhūtasya vai dvija / viṣṇoraṃśo jaganmohanāśāyorvīmupāgataḥ //	The Ṛṣi Kapila is a portion of the mighty and universal Viṣṇu, who has come down upon earth to dissipate delusion and surely it is he who, in kindness to me, has thus manifested himself to me in all that you have said.

devatārādhanaṃ kṛtvā dhanasampadamicchati / putrānicchati rājyaṃ ca śreyastasyaiva tannṛpa //	To him who, by the worship of the gods, seeks for wealth, prosperity, children, or dominion, each of these is respectively best.
karma yajñātmakaṃ śreyaḥ phalaṃ tatprāptilakṣaṇam / śreyaḥ pradhānaṃ ca phale tadevānabhisaṃhite //	Best is the rite or sacrifice, that is rewarded with heavenly pleasures. Best is that which yields the best recompense, although it be not solicited.
ātmā dhyeyaḥ sadā bhupa yogayuktais tathā param / śreyastasyaiva saṃyogaḥ śreyo yaḥ paramātmanaḥ //	Selfcontemplation, ever practised by devout ascetics, is to them the best. But best of all is the identification of soul with the supreme spirit.
śreyāṃsyevamanekāni śataśoya sahasrasaḥ / santyatra paramārthastu na tvete śrūyatāṃ ca me //	Hundreds and thousands of conditions may be called the best but these are not the great and true ends of life. Hear what those are.
dharmāya tyajyate kintu paramārtho dhanaṃ yadi / vyayaś ca kriyate kasmāt kāmaprāptyupalakṣaṇaḥ //	Wealth cannot be the true end of life, for it may be relinquished through virtue, and its characteristic property is expenditure for the gratification of desire.
putraścetparamārthaḥ syātso 'py anyasya nareśvara / paramārthabhūtaḥ sonyasya paramārtho hi tatpitā //	If a son were final truth, that would be equally applicable to a different source for the son that is to one the great end of life, becomes the father of another.
evaṃ na paramārthosti jagatyasmiñcarācare / paramārtho hi kāryāṇi kāraṇānāmaśeṣataḥ //	Final or supreme truth, therefore, would not exist in this world, as in all these cases those objects which are so denominated are the effects of causes, and consequently are not finite.
rājyādiprāptiratroktā paramārthatayā yadi / paramārthā bhavantyatra na bhavanti ca vai tataḥ //	If the acquisition of sovereignty were designated by the character of being the great end of all, then finite ends would sometimes be, and sometimes cease to be.
ṛgyajuḥsāmaniṣpādyaṃ yajñakarma mataṃ tava / paramārthabhūtaṃ tatrāpi śruyatāṃ gadato mama //	If you suppose that the objects to be effected by sacrificial rites, performed according to the rules of the Rik, Yajur, and Sama Vedas, be the great end of life, attend to what I have to say.
yattu niṣpādyate kāryaṃ mṛdā kāraṇabhūtayā / tatkāraṇānugamanāj jñāyate nṛpa mṛṇmayam // evaṃ vināśibhir dravyaiḥ samidājyakuśādibhiḥ / niṣpādyate kriyā yā tu sā bhavitrī vināśinī //	Any effect which is produced through the causality of earth partakes of the character of its origin, and consists itself of clay so any act performed by perishable agents, such as fuel, clarified butter, and Kuśa grass, must itself be of but temporary efficacy.
anāśo paramārthaś ca prājñaurabhyupagamyate / tattu nāśi na sandeho nāśidravyopapāditam //	The great end of life or truth is considered by the wise to be eternal but it would be transient, if it were accomplished through transitory things.
tadevāphaladaṃ karma paramārtho matastava / muktisādhanabhūtatvātparamārtho na sādhanam //	If you imagine that this great truth is the performance of religious acts, from which no recompense is sought, it is not so for such acts are the means of obtaining liberation, and truth is the end, not the means.
dhyānaṃ caivātmano bhūpu paramārthārthaśabditam / bhedakāri parebhyastu paramārtho na bhedavān // paramātmātmanoryogaḥ paramārtha itīṣyate / mithyaitadanyadravyaṃ hi naiti taddravyatāṃ yataḥ //	Meditation on self, again, is said to be for the sake of supreme truth but the object of this is to establish distinctions between soul and body, and the great truth of all is without distinctions. Union of self with supreme spirit is said to be the great end of all but this is false for one substance cannot become substantially another.
tasmācchreyāṃsyaśeṣāṇi nṛvaitāni na saṃśayaḥ / paramārthastu bhūpāla saṃkṣepācchrūyatāṃ mama //	Objects, then, which are considered most desirable are infinite. What the great end of all is, you shall, monarch, briefly learn from me.

tasyātmaparadeheṣu satopyekamayaṃ hi yat / vijñānaṃ paramārtho 'sau dvaitino 'tathyarśinaḥ //	The knowledge that this spirit, which is essentially one, is in ones own and in all other bodies, is the great end, or true wisdom, of one who knows the unity and the true principles of things.
veṇurandhraprabhedena bhedaḥ ṣaṅjādisaṃjñitaḥ / abhedavyāpinovāyostathāsya paramātmanaḥ //	As one diffusive air, passing through the perforations of a flute, is distinguished as the notes of the scale Sherga and the rest, so the nature of the great spirit is single, though its forms be manifold, arising from the consequences of acts.
ekasvarūpabhedaś ca brāhmakarmāvṛtiprajaḥ / devādibhede 'padhvasteṃ nāstyevāvaraṇe hi saḥ //	When the difference of the investing form, as that of god or the rest, is destroyed, then there is no distinction.”

śrūyatāṃ nṛpaśārdūla yadgītamṛbhuṇā purā / avabodhaṃ janayatā nidāghasya mahātmanaḥ //	“Listen, prince,” he proceeded, “to what was formerly uttered by Ribhu, imparting holy knowledge to the Brahman Nidāgha.
ṛbhunāmābhavatputro brahmaṇaḥ parameṣṭhinaḥ / vijñātatattvasadbhāvo nisargādeva bhūpate //	Ribhu was a son of the supreme Brahmā, who, from his innate disposition, was of a holy character, and acquainted with true wisdom.

devikāyāstaṭe vīranagaraṃ nāma vai puram / samṛddamatiramyaṃ ca pulastyena viveśitma //	”The residence of Pulastya was at Vīranagara, a large handsome city on the banks of the Devīkā river.
ramyopavanaparyante sa tasminpārthivottama / nidāgho nāma yogajña ṛbhuśiṣyo 'vasat purā //	In a beautiful grove adjoining to the stream the pupil of Ribhu, Nidāgha, conversant with devotional practices, abode.
divye varṣasahasre tu samatītesya tatpuram / jagāma sa ṛbhuḥ śiṣyaṃ nidāghamavalokakaḥ //	When a thousand divine years had elapsed, Ribhu went to the city of Pulastya, to visit his disciple.

ṛbhuruvāca	“Ribhu.
bho vipravarya bhoktavyaṃ yadannaṃ bhavato guhe / tatkathyatāṃ kadanneṣu na prītiḥ satataṃ mama //	‘Tell me, illustrious Brahman, what food there is in your house for I am not fond of indifferent viands.’

nidāgha uvāca	“Nidāgha.
apite paramā tṛptirutpannā tuṣṭireva ca / api te mānasaṃsvasthamāhāreṇa kṛtaṃ dvija // kvanivāso bhavānvipra kva ca gantuṃsamudyataḥ / āgamyate ca bhavatā yatastacca dvijocyatām //	‘Have you eaten sufficiently, and with pleasure, great Brahman? and has your mind received contentment from your food? Where is your present residence? whither do you purpose going? and whence, holy sir, have you now come?’
ṛmuruvāca	”Ribhu.
kṣudyasya tasya bhuktenne tṛptirbrāhmaṇa jāyate / na me kṣunnābhavattṛptiḥ kasmānmāṃ paripṛcchasi // vahninā pārthive dhātau kṣapite kṣutsamudbhavaḥ / bhavatyambhasi ca kṣīṇe nṛṇāṃ tṛḍapi jāyate //	‘A hungry man, Brahman, must needs be satisfied when he has finished his meal. Why should you inquire if my hunger has been appeased? When the earthy element is parched by fire, then hunger is engendered and thirst is produced when the moisture of the body has been absorbed by internal or digestive heat.
kṣuttuṣṇe dehadharmākhye na mamaite yato dvija / tataḥ kṣutsambhavābhāvāttṛptirastyeva me sadā // manasaḥ svasthatā tuṣṭiścittadharmāvimau dvija / cetaso yasya tatpṛccha pumān ebhir na yujyate //	Hunger and thirst are the functions of the body, and satisfaction must always be afforded me by that by which they are removed for when hunger is no longer sensible, pleasure and contentment of mind are faculties of the intellect ask their condition of the mind then, for man is not affected by them.
kva nivāsastavetyuktaṃ kva gantāsi ca yattvāyā / kutāścāgamyate tatra tritayepi nibodha meḥ //	For your three other questions, Where I dwell? Whither I go? and Whence I come? hear this reply.

I neither am going nor coming, nor is my dwelling in any one place nor art thou, thou nor are others, others nor am I, I.
mṛṣṭaṃ na mṛṣṭamapyeṣā jijñāsā me kṛtā tava / kiṃ vakṣyasīti tatrāpi śrūyatāṃ dvijasattama //	If you wonder what reply I should make to your inquiry why I made any distinction between sweetened and unsweetened food, you shall hear my explanation.
kimasvādvatha vā mṛṣṭaṃ bhuñjatosti dvijottama / mṛṣṭameva yathā mṛṣṭaṃ tadevodvegakārakam // amṛṣṭaṃ jāyate mṛṣṭaṃ mṛṣṭādudvijate janaḥ / ādimadhyāvasāneṣu kimannaṃ rucikārakam //	What is there that is really sweet or not sweet to one eating a meal? That which is sweet, is no longer so when it occasions the sense of repletion and that which is not sweet, becomes sweet when a man being very hungry fancies that it is so.
mṛṇmayaṃ hi gṛhaṃ yadvan mṛdā liptaṃ sthiraṃ bhavet / parthivoyaṃ tathā dehaḥ pārthivaiḥ paramāṇubhiḥ // yavagodhūmamudgādi ghṛtaṃ tailaṃ payo dadhi / guḍaṃphalādīni tathā pārthivāḥ paramāṇavaḥ //	What food is there that first, middle, and last is equally grateful. As a house built of clay is strengthened by fresh plaster, so is this earthly body supported by earthly particles and barley, wheat, pulse, butter, oil, milk, curds, treacle, fruits, and the like, are composed of atoms of earth.
tadetadbhavatā jñātvā mṛṣṭāmṛṣṭavicāri yat / tanmanaḥsamatālambi kāryaṃ sāmyaṃ hi muktaye //	This therefore is to be understood by you, that the mind which properly judges of what is or is not sweet is impressed with the notion of identity, and that this effect of identity tends to liberation.’

evamekamidaṃ viddhi na bhedi sakalaṃ jagat / vāsudevābhidheyasya svarūpaṃ paramātmanaḥ //	Know this whole universe to be the one undivided nature of the supreme spirit, entitled Vāsudeva.’ Thus having spoken, and receiving the prostrate homage of Nidāgha, rendered with fervent faith, Ribhu went his way.”
brāhmaṇa uvāca tathatyuktvā nidāghena praṇipātapuraḥsaram / pūjataḥ parayā bhaktyā icchātaḥ prayayāv ṛbhuḥ //	Ribhu returns to his disciple, and perfects him in divine knowledge. The same recommended to the Rājā by Bharata, who thereupon obtains final liberation.

dṛṣṭvā nidāghaṃ sa ṛbhurupagamyābhivādya ca / uvāca kasmādekānte sthīyate bhavatā dvija //	Ribhu approached him, and saluting him reverentially as if he was a stranger demanded why he was standing in such a retired spot.

You have shewn me, observed Ribhu, ‘at one moment the elephant and the king, without noticing any peculiar characteristic by which they may be distinguished.
etau hi gajarājānau yugapaddarśitau mama / bhavatā na viśeṣeṇa pṛthakcihnopalakṣaṇau // tatkathyatāṃ mahābhāga viśeṣo bhavatānayoḥ / jñātumicchāmyahaṃ kotra gajaḥ ko vā narādhipaḥ // nidāgha uvāca	Tell me, venerable sir, is there any difference between them? for I am desirous to know which is here the elephant, which is the king.’ ‘The elephant,’ answered Nidāgha, ‘is underneath the king is above him.

uparyahaṃ yathā rājā tvamadhaḥ kuñjaro yathā / avabodhāya te brahmandṛṣṭānto darśito mayā // ṛbhuruvāca tvaṃ rājena dvijaśreṣṭha sthitohaṃ gajavadyadi / tadetattvaṃ samācakṣva katamastvamahaṃ tathā //	This example, Brahman, is intended for your information.’ Very well, said Ribhu, you, it seems, are as it were the Rājā, and I am like the elephant but come now do you tell me which of us two is you which is I.

To this Ribhu replied, ‘I am your preceptor, by name Ribhu, who, pleased with the dutiful attention he has received, has come to Nidāgha to give him instruction for this purpose have I briefly intimated to you divine truth, the essence of which is the nonduality of all.’ Having thus spoken to Nidāgha, the Brahman Ribhu went away, leaving his disciple profoundly impressed, by his instructions, with belief in unity.
sarvabhūtānyabhedena dadṛśe sa tadātmanaḥ / yathā brahmaparo muktimavāpa paramāṃ dvijaḥ //	He beheld all beings thenceforth as the same with himself, and, perfect in holy knowledge, obtained final liberation.

If that which is eaten by one at a Śrāddha gives satisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a distance to bring food for presentation in person.” “First, then, let it be determined what may be rationally believed by mankind, and then,” said their preceptor, “you will find that felicity may be expected from my instructions.

According to the law there are four conditions or orders of men of the three first castes, the religious student, the householder, the hermit, and the mendicant.

The man who neglects his permanent observances for one day and night, being able to perform them, iñcurs thereby sin for one day and should he omit them, not being in trouble, for a fortnight, he can be purified only by arduous expiation.

ekadā tu samaṃ snātau tau tu bhāryāpatī jale / bhāgīrathyāḥsamuttīrṇau kārttikyāṃ samupoṣitau / pāṣaṇḍinamapaśyetāmāyāntaṃ saṃmukhaṃ dvija //	On one occasion, when they had fasted on the full moon of Kārtika, and had bathed in the Bhagirathī, they beheld, as they came up from the water, a heretic approach them, who was the friend of the Rājās military preceptor.
cāpācāryasya tasyāsau sakhā rājño mahātmanaḥ / atastadgauravāttena sakhābhāvamathākarot // na tu sā vāgyatā devī tasya patnī pativratā / upoṣitāsmīti raviṃ tasmindṛṣṭe dadarśa ca //	The Rājā, out of respect to the latter, entered into conversation with the heretic but not so did the princess reflecting that she was observing a fast, she turned from him, and cast her eyes up to the sun.

tataḥsā divyayā dṛṣṭyā dṛṣṭvā śvānaṃ nijaṃ patim / vidiśākhyaṃ puraṃ gatvā tadavasthaṃ dadarśa tam //	With the eye of divine intelligence she knew that her own husband had been regenerate as a dog, and going once to the city of Vaidiśā she saw the dog, and recognised her former lord in him.

Thou wast then a dog, then a jackal, and art now a wolf.” Upon this, recollecting himself, the prince abandoned his life, and became a vulture in which form his lovely queen still found him, and aroused him to a knowledge of the past.

tatastu janako rājā vājimedhaṃ mahākratum / cakāra tasyāvabhṛthe snāpayāmāsa taṃ tadā //	The king of Kāśī instituted at that time the solemn sacrifice of a horse.

When the election took place, the princess made choice of her former lord, who appeared amongst the candidates, and again invested him with the character of her husband.

I have asked for nothing which may not be readily accorded and what is there that shall he unattainable to you, if my desires be gratified by the damsel whom you must needs give unto me?” To this, the king, apprehensive of his displeasure, answered and said, “Grave sir, it is the established usage of our house to wed our daughters to such persons only as they shall themselves select from suitors of fitting rank and since this your request is not yet made known to my maidens, it is impossible to say whether it may be equally agreeable to them as it is to me.

In the course of time the daughters of Māndhātri bore to Saubhari a hundred and fifty sons, and day by day his affection for his children became more intense, and his heart was wholly occupied, with the sentiment of self.

Not so with the attendant spirits at the court of Indra and nymphs, genii, and quiristers, found heaven itself but dull whilst Urvaśī was away.

Had I a husband, this would not have happened! To whom shall I apply for aid?" The Rājā overheard her lamentation, but recollecting that he was undressed, and that Urvaśī might see him in that state, did not move from the couch.

At that moment the Gandharvas caused a flash of brilliant lightning to play upon the chamber, and Urvaśī beheld the king undressed the compact was violated, and the nymph immediately disappeared.

vahnisthālī mayaiṣānītā norvaśīti // athaināmaṭavyāmevāgnisthālīṃ tatyāja svapuraṃ ca jagām //	Then he began to reflect that he had committed a great folly in bringing away the vessel of fire instead of his bride and leaving the vessel in the wood, he went disconsolate to his palace.

Satrājit, on the other hand, fearing that Kṛṣṇa would ask him for the jewel, transferred it to his brother Prasena.

Ascertaining by this means that he and his horse had been killed by a lion, he was acquitted by all the people of any share in his death.

Following the footmarks of the latter, he arrived at the foot of a mountain, where he desired the Yādavas to await him, whilst he continued the track.

Should Achyuta therefore enter into feud with you, we will take your part.” Upon this promise Śatadhanwan undertook to slay Satrājit.

Dismiss excessive sorrow it needs not your lamentations to excite any wrath.” Returning forthwith to Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa took Baladeva apart, and said to him, “A lion slew Prasena, hunting in the forests and now Satrājit has been murdered by Śatadhanwan.

There is no one even amongst the immortals, whose praises are celebrated throughout the universe, who is capable of contending with the wielder of the discus, at the stamp of whose foot the three worlds tremble whose hand makes the wives of the Asuras widows, whose weapons no host, however mighty, can resist no one is capable of encountering the wielder of the ploughshare, who annihilates the prowess of his enemies by the glances of his eyes, that roll with the joys of wine and whose vast ploughshare manifests his might, by seizing and exterminating the most formidable foes.” “Since this is the case,” replied Śatadhanwan, “and you are unable to assist me, at least accept and take care of this jewel.” “I will do so,” answered Akrūra, “if you promise that even in the last extremity you will not divulge its being in my possession.” To this Śatadhanwan agreed, and Akrūra took the jewel and the former mounting a very swift mare, one that could travel a hundred leagues a day, fled from Dvārakā.

When Balabhadra heard this, he flew into a violent rage, and said to Vāsudeva, “Shame light upon you, to be thus greedy of wealth! I acknowledge no brotherhood with you.

The sun of Achyuta rose in the dawn of Devakī to cause the lotus petal of the universe to expand. On the day of his birth the quarters of the horizon were irradiate with joy, as if moonlight was diffused over the whole earth.

What have we to fear from the Ādityas, the Vasus, the Agnis, or any others of the immortals, who have all been vanquished by my resistless arms? Have I not seen the king of the gods, when he had ventured into the conflict, quickly retreat from the field, receiving my shafts upon his back, not bravely upon his breast? When in resentment he withheld the fertilizing showers from my kingdom, did not my arrows compel the clouds to part with their waters, as much as were required? Are not all the monarchs of the earth in terror of my prowess, and subject to my orders, save only Jarāsandha my sire? Now, chiefs of the Daitya race, it is my determination to inflict still deeper degradation upon these evilminded and unprincipled gods.
tadye yaśasvinaḥ kecitpṛthivyāṃ ye ca yajvanaḥ / kāryo devāpakārāya teṣāṃ sarvātmanā vadhaḥ //	Let therefore every man who is notorious for liberality in gifts to gods and Brahmans, every man who is remarkable for his celebration of sacrifices, be put to death, that thus the gods shall be deprived of the means by which they subsist.

ityājñāpyāsurānkasaḥ praviśyāśu gṛhaṃ tataḥ / mumoca vasudevaṃ ca devakīṃ ca nirodataḥ //	Having issued these commands, Kansa retired into his palace, and liberated Vasudeva and Devakī from their captivity.
kaṃsa uvāca	“It is in vain,”
tadalaṃ paritāpena nunaṃ tadbhāvino hi te / arbhakā yuvayordeṣāccāyuṣo yadviyojitāḥ //	said he to them, “that I have slain all your children, since after all he who is destined to kill me has escaped.
śrīparāśara uvāca	It is of no use to regret the past.

vimukto vasudevo 'pi nandasya śakaṭaṃ gataḥ / prahṛṣṭaṃ dṛṣṭavānnandaṃ putro jāto mameti vai //	WHEN Vasudeva was set at liberty, he went to the waggon of Nanda, and found Nanda there rejoicing that a son was born to him.
vasudevopi taṃ prāha diṣṭyādiṣṭyeti sādaram / vārdhake 'pi samutpannastanayo 'yaṃ tavādhunā //	Vasudeva spake to him kindly, and congratulated him on having a son in his old age.

Up, Nanda, quickly, and set off to your own pastures and let this boy, the son whom Rohiṇī has borne me, accompany you, and be brought up by you as this your own son.” Accordingly Nanda and the other cowherds, their goods being placed in their waggons, and their taxes having been paid to the king, returned to their village.
vasatāṃ gokule teṣāṃ pūtanā bālaghātinī / suptaṃ kṛṣṇamupādāya rātrau tasmai stanaṃ dadau //	Some time after they were settled at Gokula, the female fiend Pūtanā, the childkiller, came thither by night, and finding the little Kṛṣṇa asleep, took him up, and gave him her breast to suck.
yasmai yasmai stanaṃ rātrau pūtanā saṃprayacchati / tasyatasya kṣaṇenāṅgaṃ bālakasyopahanyate // kṛṣṇastu tatstanaṃ gāḍhaṃ karābhyāmatipīḍitam / gṛhītvā prāṇasahitaṃ papaukrodhasamanvitaḥ // sātimuktamahārāvā vicchinnastrāyubandhanā / papāta pūtanā bhūmau mriyamāṇātibhīṣaṇā //	Now whatever child is suckled in the night by Pūtanā instantly dies but Kṛṣṇa, laying hold of the breast with both hands, sucked it with such violence, that he drained it of the life and the hideous Pūtanā, roaring aloud, and giving way in every joint, fell on the ground expiring.
tannādaśrutisaṃtrastāḥ pravuddhāste vrajaukasaḥ / dadṛśuḥ pūtanotsaṃge kṛṣṇaṃ tāṃ ca nipātitām //	The inhabitants of Vraja awoke in alarm at the cries of the fiend, ran to the spot, and beheld Pūtanā lying on the earth, and Kṛṣṇa in her arms.
ādāya kṛṣṇaṃ saṃtrastā yaśodāpi dvijottama / gopucchabhrāmaṇenātha bāladoṣamapākarot // gokarīṣamupādāya nandagopopi mastake / kṛṣṇasya pradado rakṣāṃ kurvaścaitadudīrayan // nandagopa uvāca rakṣatu tvāmaśeṣāṇāṃ bhūtānāṃ prabhavo hariḥ / yasya nābhisamudbhūtapaṅkajādabhavajjagat //	Yaśodā snatching up Kṛṣṇa, waved over him a cowtail brush to guard him from harm, whilst Nanda placed dried cowdung powdered upon his head he gave him also an amulet, saying at the same time, “May Hari, the lord of all beings without reserve, protect you he from the lotus of whose navel the world was developed, and on the tip of whose tusks the globe was upraised from the waters.
yena daṃṣṭrāgravidhṛtā dhārayatyavanirjagat / varāharūpadhṛgdevaḥsa tvāṃ rakṣatu keśavaḥ //	May that Keśava, who assumed the form of a boar, protect thee.

May that Keśava, who, appearing first as the dwarf, suddenly traversed in all his might, with three paces, the three regions of the universe, constantly defend thee.

May all ghosts, goblins, and spirits malignant and unfriendly, ever fly thee, appalled by the bow, the discus, mace, and sword of Viṣṇu, and the echo of his shell.

May Ṛṣikeśa defend thee in the sky, and Mahīdhara upon earth.” Having pronounced this prayer to avert all evil, Nanda put the child to sleep in his bed underneath the waggon.
te ca gopā mahaddṛṣṭvā pūtanāyāḥ kalevaram / mṛtāyāḥ paramaṃ trāsaṃ vismayaṃ ca tadā yayuḥ //	Beholding the vast carcass of Pūtanā, the cowherds were filled with astonishment and terror.

tato hāhākṛtaḥ sarvo goparopījano dvija / ājagāmātha dadṛśe bālamutānaśāyinam // gopāḥ keneti kenedaṃ śakaṭaṃ parivartitam / tatraiva bālakāḥ procurbālenānena pātitam //	The cowherds and their wives, hearing the noise, came exclaiming, “Ah! ah!” and there they found the child sleeping on his back. “Who could have upset the waggon?” said the cowherds.
rudatā dṛṣṭamasmābhiḥ pādavikṣepapātitam / śakaṭaṃ parivṛttaṃ vai naitadanyasya ceṣṭitam // tataḥ punaratīvāsangopā vismayacetasaḥ / nandagopopi jagrāha bālamatyantavismitaḥ // yaśodā śakaṭārūḍhabhagnabhāṇḍakapālikā / śakaṭaṃ cārcayāmāsa dadhipuṣpaphalākṣataiḥ //	“This child,” replied some boys, who witnessed the circumstance “we saw him,” said they, “crying, and kicking the waggon with his feet, and so it was overturned no one else had any thing to do with it.” The cowherds were exceedingly astonished at this account and Nanda, not knowing what to think, took up the boy whilst Yaśodā offered worship to the broken pieces of pots and to the waggon, with curds, flowers, fruit, and unbruised grain.
gargaś ca gokule tatra vasudevapracoditaḥ / pracchanna eva gopānāṃ saṃskārāna karottayoḥ // jyeṣṭhaṃ ca rāmamityāha kṛṣṇaṃ caiva tathāvaram / gargo matimatāṃ śreṣṭho nāma kurvanmahāmatiḥ //	The initiatory rites requisite for the two boys were performed by Garga, who was sent to Gokula by Vasudeva for that purpose he celebrated them without the knowledge of the cowherds and the wise sage, eminent amongst the wise, named the elder of them Rāma, and the other Kṛṣṇa.
svalpenaiva tu kālena raṅgiṇau tau tadā vrahe / ghṛṣṭajānukarau vipra babhūvaturubhāvapi //	In a short time they began to crawl about the ground, supporting themselves on their hands and knees, and creeping every where, often amidst ashes and filth.

As they disregarded the prohibitions of Yaśodā, and rambled about together constantly, she became angry, and taking up a stick, followed them, and threatened the darkcomplexioned Kṛṣṇa with a whipping.
dāmnā madhye tato baddhā babandha tamulūkhale / kṛṣṇamakliṣṭakarmāṇamāha cedamamarṣitā // yadi śaknoṣi gaccha tvamaticañcalaceṣṭita / ityuktvātha nijaṃ karma sā cakāra kuṭuṃbinī // vyāgrāyāmatha tasyāṃ sa karṣamāma ulūkhalam / yamalārjunamadhyena jagāma kamalekṣaṇaḥ // karṣatā vṛkṣayormadhye tiryaggatamulūkhalam / bhagnāvuttuṅgaśākhāgrau tena tau yamalārjunau //	Fastening a cord round his waist, she tied him to the wooden mortar, and being in a great passion, she said to him, “Now, you naughty boy, get away from hence if you can.” She then went about her domestic affairs. As soon as she had departed, the lotuseyed Kṛṣṇa, endeavouring to extricate himself, pulled the mortar after him to the space between two Arjuna trees that grew near together having dragged the mortar between these trees, it became wedged awry there, and as Kṛṣṇa pulled it through, it pulled down the trunks of the trees.
tataḥ kaṭakaṭaśabdasamākarmanatatparaḥ / ājagāma vrajajano dadarśa ca mahādrumau // navodgatālpadantāṃśusitahāsaṃ ca bālakam / tayormadhyagataṃ dāmnā baddhaṃ gāḍhaṃ tathodare //	Hearing the crackling noise, the people of Vraja came to see what was the matter, and there they beheld the two large trees, with shattered stems and broken branches, prostrate on the ground, with the child fixed between them, with a rope round his belly, laughing, and shewing his white little teeth, just budded.
tataś ca tāmodaratāṃ sa yayau dāmabandhanāt //	It is hence that Kṛṣṇa is called Dāmodara, from the binding of the rope dāma round his belly udara.
gopavṛddhāstataḥ sarve nandagopapurogamāḥ / mantrayāmāsurudvignā mahotpātātibhīravaḥ //	The elders of the cowherds, with Nanda at their head, looked upon these circumstances with alarm, considering them as of evil omen.
sthāneneha na naḥ kāryaṃ vrajāmonyanmahāvanam / utpātā bahavo hyatra dṛśyante nāśahetavaḥ // pūtanāyā vināśaś ca śakaṭasya viparyayaḥ / vinā vātādidoṣeṇa drumayoḥ patanantathā //	“We cannot remain in this place,” said they “let us go to some other part of the forest for here many evil signs threaten us with destruction the death of Pūtanā, the upsetting of the waggon, and the fall of the trees without their being blown down by the wind.
vṛndāvanamitaḥsthānāttasmādgacchāma mā ciram / yāvadbhaumamahotpātadoṣo nābhibhavevdrajam //	Let us depart hence without delay, and go to Vrindāvana, where terrestrial prodigies may no more disturb us.”
iti kṛtvā matiṃ sarve gamane te vrajaukasaḥ / ūcuḥ svaṃ svaṃ kulaṃ śīghraṃ gamyatāṃ mā vilaṃbatha // tataḥ kṣaṇena prayayuḥ śakaṭair godhanais tathā / yūthaśo vatsapālāś ca kālayanto vrajaukasaḥ // dravyāvayavanirdhūtaṃ kṣaṇamātreṇa tattathā / kākabhāsasamākīrṇaṃ vrajasthānamabhūddūja //	Having thus resolved, the inhabitants of Vraja communicated their intention to their families, and desired them to move without delay. Accordingly they set off with their waggons and their cattle, driving before them their bulls and cows and calves the fragments of their household stores they threw away, and in an instant Vraja was overspread with flights of crows.
vṛndāvanaṃ bhagavatā kṛṣṇenā kliṣṭakarmaṇā / śubhena manasā dhyātaṃ gavaṃ siddhimabhīpsatā //	Vrindāvana was chosen by Kṛṣṇa, whom acts do not affect, for the sake of providing for the nourishment of the kine for there in the hottest season the new grass springs up as verdantly as in the rains.
sa samāvāsitaḥ sarvo vrajo vṛndāvane tataḥ / śakaṭāvāṭaparyantaścandrārdhākārasaṃsthitaḥ //	Having repaired, then, from Vraja to Vrindāvana, the inhabitants of the former drew up their waggons in the form of a crescent.
vatsapālau ca saṃvṛttau rāmadāmodarau tataḥ / eka sthanasthitau goṣṭhe ceraturbālalīlayā //	As the two boys, Rāma and Dāmodara, grew up, they were ever together in the same place, and engaged in the same boyish sports.
barhipatrakṛtāpīḍau vanyapuṣpāvataṃsakau / gopaveṇukṛtātodyapatravādyakṛtasvanau // kākapakṣadharau bālau kumārāviva pāvakī / hasaṃtau ca ramantau ca ceratuḥ sma mahāvanam // kvacidvahantāvanyonyaṃ krīḍamānau tathā paraiḥ / gopaputraiḥ samaṃ vatsāṃścārayantau viceratuḥ //	They made themselves crests of the peacocks plumes, and garlands of forest flowers, and musical instruments of leaves and reeds, or played upon the pipes used by the cowherds their hair was trimmed like the wings of the crow, and they resembled two young princes, portions of the deity of war they were robust, and they roamed about, always laughing and playing, sometimes with each other, sometimes with other boys driving along with the young cowherds the calves to pasture.
kālena gacchatā tau tu saptavarṣau mahāvraje / sarvasya jagataḥ pālau vatsapālau babhūvatuḥ //	Thus the two guardians of the world were keepers of cattle, until they had attained seven years of age, in the cowpens of Vrindavan.
prāvṛṭkālastatotīva meghaughasthagitāṃbaraḥ / babhūva vāridhārābhir aikyaṃ kurvandiśāmiva // prarūḍhanavaśaṣpāḍhyā śakragopācitā mahī / tathā mārakatīvāsītpadmarāgavibhūṣitā // ūhurunmārgavāhīni nimnagāṃbhāṃsi sarvataḥ / manāṃsi durvinītānāṃ prāpya lakṣmīṃ navāmiva //	Then came on the season of the rains, when the atmosphere laboured with accumulated clouds, and the quarters of the horizon were blended into one by the driving showers. The waters of the rivers rose, and overflowed their banks, and spread beyond all bounds, like the minds of the weak and wicked transported beyond restraint by sudden prosperity.
na rejentaritaścandro nirmalo malinair ghanaiḥ / sadvādivādo mūrkhaṇāṃ pragalbhābhir ivoktibhiḥ //	The pure radiance of the moon was obscured by heavy vapours, as the lessons of holy writ are darkened by the arrogant scoffs of fools and unbelievers.
nirguṇenāpi cāpena śakrasya gagane padam / avāpyatāvivekasya nṛpasyaiva parigrahe // meghapṛṣṭhe balākānāṃ rarāja vimalā tatiḥ / durvatte vṛttaceṣṭeva kulīnasyātiśaubhanā // na ba bandhāṃbare sthairyaṃ vidyudatyantacañcalā / maitrīva pravare puṃsi durjanena prayojitā //	The bow of Indra held its place in the heavens all unstrung, like a worthless man elevated by an injudicious prince to honour. The white line of storks appeared upon the back of the cloud, in such contrast as the bright conduct of a man of respectability opposes to the behaviour of a scoundrel. The everfitful lightning, in its new alliance with the sky, was like the friendship of a profligate for a man of worth.
mārgā babhūvur aspaṣṭās tṛṇaśaṣpacayāvṛtāḥ / arthāntaramanuprāptāḥ prajaḍānāmivoktayaḥ //	Overgrown by the spreading grain, the paths were indistinctly traced, like the speech of the ignorant, that conveys no positive meaning.
unmattaśikhisāraṅge tasminkāle mahāvane / kṛṣṇarāmau mudāyuktau gopālaiś ceratuḥ saha //	At this time Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, accompanied by the cowboys, traversed the forests, that echoed with the hum of bees and the peacocks cry.
kvicidgobhiḥ samaṃ ramyaṃ goyatānaratāvubhau / ceratuḥ kvacidatyarthaṃ śītavṛkṣatalāśritau // kvacitkadaṃbasrakcitrau mayūrasragvirājitau / viliptau kvacidāsātāṃ vividhair giridhātubhiḥ // parṇaśayyāsu saṃsuptau kvacinnidrāntaraiṣiṇau / kvacidgarjati jīmūte hāhākāraravākulau // gāyatāmanya gopānāṃ praśaṃsāparamau kvacit / mayūrakekānugatau gopaveṇupravādakau //	Sometimes they sang in chorus, or danced together sometimes they sought shelter from the cold beneath the trees sometimes they decorated themselves with flowery garlands, sometimes with peacocks feathers sometimes they stained themselves of various hues with the minerals of the mountain sometimes weary they reposed on beds of leaves, and sometimes imitated in mirth the muttering of the thundercloud sometimes they excited their juvenile associates to sing, and sometimes they mimicked the cry of the peacock with their pipes.
iti nānāvidhair bhāvair uttamaprītisaṃyutau / krīḍantau tau vane tasmiñceratustuṣṭamānasau //	In this manner participating in various feelings and emotions, and affectionately attached to each other, they wandered, sporting and happy, through the wood.
vikāle ca samaṃ gobhir gopavṛndasamanvitau / vihṛtyātha yathāyogaṃ vrajametya mahābalau // gopaiḥ samānaiḥ sahitau krīḍantāvamarāviva / evaṃ tāvūṣatustatra rāmakṛṣṇau mahādyutī //	At eveningtide came Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, like two cowboys, along with the cows and the cowherds. At eveningtide the two immortals, having come to the cowpens, joined heartily in whatever sports amused the sons of the herdsmen.
ekadā tu vinā rāmaṃ kṛṣṇo vṛndāvanaṃ yayau / vicacāra vṛto gopair vanyapuṣpasragujjvalaḥ //	ONE day Kṛṣṇa, unaccompanied by Rāma, went to Vrindavan he was attended by a troop of cowherds, and gaily decorated with wild flowers.
sa jagāmātha kālindīṃ lola kallolaśālinīm / tīrasaṃlagnaphenaughair hasantīm iva sarvataḥ // tasyāścatimahābhīmaṃ viṣāgniśritavāriṇam / hradaṃ kālīyanāgasya dadarśativibhīṣaṇam // viṣāgninā prasaratā dagdhatīraṃmahīruham / vātāhatāṃbuvikṣepasparśadagdhavihaṅgamam //	On his way he came to the Yamunā, which was flowing in sportive undulations, and sparkling with foam, as if with smiles, as the waves dashed against the borders. Within its bed, however, was the fearful pool of the serpent Kālīya, boiling with the fires of poison from the fumes of which, large trees upon the bank were blighted, and by whose waters, when raised by a gale into the air, birds were scorched.
tamatīva mahā raudraṃ mṛtyuvakramivāparam / vilokya cintayāmāsa bhagavānmadhusūdanaḥ // asminvasati duṣṭātmā kālīyo 'sau viṣāyudhaḥ / yo mayā nirjitastyaktvā duṣṭo gacchetpayonidhim // teneyaṃ dūṣitā sarvā yamunā sāgaraṅgamā / na naraigodhanaiś cāpi tṛṣārtair upabhujyate //	Beholding this dreadful lake, which was like another mouth of death, Madhusūdana reflected that the wicked and poisonous Kālīya, who had been vanquished by himself in the person of Garuḍa, and had been obliged to fly from the ocean where he had inhabited the island Ramaṇaka, must be lurking at its bottom, and defiling the Yamunā, the consort of the sea, so that neither men nor cattle could slake their thirst by her waters.
tadasya nāgarājasya kartavyo nigraho mayā / nistrāsāstu sukhaṃ yena careyurvrajavāsinaḥ // etadarthaṃ tu lokesminnavatāraḥ kṛto mayā / yadeṣāmutpathasthānāṃ kāryā śāntirdurātmanām //	Such being the case, he determined to dislodge the Nāga, and enable the dwellers of Vraja to frequent the vicinage without fear for it was the especial purpose he considered of his descent upon earth to reduce to subjection all such violators of law.
tadetaṃ nātidūrasthaṃ kadaṃbamuruśākhinam / adirudya patiṣyāmi hrade 'sminnanilāśinaḥ // śrīparāśara uvāca itthaṃ vicintya baddhā ca gāḍhaṃ parikaraṃ tataḥ / nipapāta hrade tatra nāgarājasya vegataḥ //	“Here,” thought he, “is a Kadamba tree, which is sufficiently near I can climb up it, and thence leap into the serpents pool.” Having thus resolved, he bound his clothes tightly about him, and jumped boldly into the lake of the serpentking.
tenātipatatā tatra kṣobhitaḥsa mahāhradaḥ / atyarthaṃ dūrajātāṃstu samasiṃcanmahīruhān // te hi duṣṭaviṣajvālātaptāṃbupavanokṣitāḥ / jajvaluḥ pādāpāḥsadyo jvālāvyāptadigantarāḥ //	The waters, agitated by his plunge amidst them, were scattered to a considerable distance from the bank, and the spray falling upon the trees, they were immediately set on fire by the heat of the poisonous vapour combined with the water and the whole horizon was in a blaze.
āsphoṭayāmāsa tadā kṛṣṇo nāgahrane bhujam / tacchabdaśravaṇāccāśu nāgarājo 'bhyupāgamat // ātāmranayanaḥ kopādviṣajvālākulair mukhaiḥ / vṛto mahāviṣaiś cānyair uragair anilāśanaiḥ // nāgapatnyaś ca śataśo hārihāropaśobhitāḥ / prakaṃpitatanukṣepacalatkuntasakāntayaḥ //	Kṛṣṇa, having dived into the pool, struck his arms in defiance, and the snakeking, hearing the sound, quickly came forth his eyes were coppery red, and his hoods were flaming with deadly venom he was attended by many other powerful and poisonous snakes, feeders upon air, and by hundreds of serpentnymphs, decorated with rich jewels, whose earrings glittered with trembling radiance as the wearers moved along.
tataḥ praveṣṭitaḥsarpaiḥ sa kṛṣṇe bhogabandhanaiḥ / dadaṃśuste 'pi taṃ kṛṣṇaṃ viṣajvālākulair mukhaiḥ //	Coiling themselves around Kṛṣṇa, they all bit him with teeth from which fiery poison was emitted.
taṃ tatra patitaṃ dṛṣṭvā sarpabhogaurnipīḍitam / gopā vrajamupāgamya cukruśuḥ śokalālasāḥ //	Kṛṣṇas companions, beholding him in the lake, encompassed by the snakes, twining around him, ran off to Vraja, lamenting and bewailing aloud his fate.
eṣa mohaṃ gataḥ kṛṣṇo magnau vai kāliyahrade / bhakṣyate nāgarājena tamāgacchata paśyata // tacchutvā tatra te gopā vajrapā topamaṃ vacaḥ / gopyaś ca tvarītā jagmuryaśodāpramukhā hradam // hāhā kvāsāviti jano gopīnāmativihvalaḥ / yaśodayā samaṃ bhrānto drutapraskhalitaṃ yayau // nandagopaś ca gopāś ca rāmaścādbhutavikramaḥ / tvaritaṃ yamunāṃ jagmuḥ kṛṣṇadarśanalālāsāḥ //	“Kṛṣṇa,” they called out, “has foolishly plunged into the serpents pool, and is there bitten to death by the snakeking! Come and see.” The cowherds and their wives and Yaśodā, hearing this news, which was like a thunderbolt, ran immediately to the pool, frightened out of their senses, and crying, “Alas! alas! where is he?” The Gopīs were retarded by Yaśodā, who in her agitation stumbled and slipped at every step but Nanda and the cowherds and the invincible Rāma hastened to the banks of the Yamunā, eager to assist Kṛṣṇa.
dadṛśuścāpi te tatra sarparājavaśaṅgatam / niṣprayatnīkṛtaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ sarpabhogaviveṣṭitam //	There they beheld him apparently in the power of the serpentking, encompassed by twining snakes, and making no effort to escape.
nandagopopi niśceṣṭo nyasya putramukhe dṛśam / yaśodā ca mahābhāgā babhūva munisattama //	Nanda, as soon as he set his eyes upon his son, became senseless and Yaśodā also, when she beheld him, lost all consciousness.
gopyas tvanyā rudantyaś ca dadṛśuḥ śokakātarāḥ / procuś ca keśavaṃ prītyā bhayakātaryagadgadam // gopya ūcuḥ	The Gopīs, overcome with sorrow, wept, and called affectionately, and with convulsive sobs, upon Keśava.
sarvā yaśodayā sārdha viśāmotra mahāhradam / sarparājasya no gantumasmābhir yujyate vrajam //	“Let us all,” said they, “plunge with Yaśodā into the fearful pool of the serpentking.
divasaḥ so vinā sūryaṃ vinā candreṇa kā niśā / vinā vṛṣeṇa kā gāvo vinā kṛṣṇena ko vrajaḥ // vinākṛtā na yāsyāmaḥ kṛṣṇenānena gokulam / aramyaṃ nātisevyaṃ ca vārihīnaṃ yathā saraḥ //	We cannot return to Vraja for what is day, without the sun? what night, without the moon? what is a herd of heifers, without its lord? what is Vraja, without Kṛṣṇa? Deprived of him, we will go no more to Gokula. The forest will lose its delights it will be like a lake without water.
yatra nendīvaraśyāmakāyakāntirayaṃ hariḥ / tenāpi pāturvāsena ratirastīti vismayaḥ //	When this dark lotus leaf complexioned Hari is not present, there is no joy in the maternal dwelling.
utphullapaṅkajadalaspaṣṭakāntivilocanam / apaśyanto hariṃ dīnāḥ kathaṃ goṣṭhe bhaviṣyatha //	How strange is this! And as for you, ye cowherds, how, poor beings, will you live amidst the pastures, when you no longer behold the brilliant lotus eyes of Hari? Our hearts have been wiled away by the music of his voice.
atyanta madhurālāpahṛtāśeṣamanoratham / na vinā puṇḍarīkākṣaṃ yāsyāmo nandagokulam //	We will not go without Puṇḍarīkākṣa to the folds of Nanda.
bhogenāviṣṭitasyāpi sarparājasya paśyata / smitaśobhimukhaṃ gopyaḥ kṛṣṇasyāsmadvilokane //	Even now, though held in the coils of the serpentking, see, friends, hew his face brightens with smiles as we gaze upon him.”
iti gopīvacaḥ śrutvā rauhiṇeyo mahābalaḥ / gopāṃś ca trāsavidhurānvi lokya stimitekṣaṇān // nandaṃ ca dīnamatyarthaṃ nyastadṛṣṭiṃ sutānane / mūrchākulāṃ yaśodaṃ ca kṛṣṇamāhātmasaṃjñayā // kimidaṃ devadeveśa bhāvo 'yaṃ mānuṣastvayā / vyajyatetyantamātmānaṃ kimanantaṃ na votsi yat //	When the mighty son of Rohiṇī, Balarāma, heard these exclamations of the Gopīs, and with disdainful glance beheld the cowherds overcome with terror, Nanda gazing fixedly upon the countenance of his son, and Yaśodā unconscious, he spake to Kṛṣṇa in his own character “What is this, O god of gods! the quality of mortal is sufficiently assumed dost thou not know thyself eternal? Thou art the centre of creation, as the nave is of the spokes of a wheel.
jagatyarthaṃ jagannātha bhārāvataraṇecchayā / avatīrṇo 'si martyeṣu tavāṃśaścāhamagrajaḥ //	A portion of thee have I also been born, as thy senior.
manuṣyalīlāṃ bhagavan bhajatā bhavatā surāḥ / viḍambayantastvallīlāṃ sarva eva sahā sate //	The gods, to partake of thy pastimes as man, have all descended under a like disguise and the goddesses have come down to Gokula to join in thy sports.

Wherefore, Kṛṣṇa, dost thou disregard these divinities, who, as cowherds, are thy friends and kin? these sorrowing females, who also are thy relations? Thou hast put on the character of man thou hast exhibited the tricks of childhood now let this fierce snake, though armed with venomed fangs, be subdued by thy celestial vigour.”
iti saṃsmāritaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ smitabhinnoṣṭhasaṃpuṭaḥ / āsphoṭya mocayāmāsa svadehaṃ bhogibandhanāt //	Thus reminded of his real character by Rāma, Kṛṣṇa smiled gently, and speedily extricated himself from the coils of the snakes.
ānamya cāpi hastābhyāmubhābhyāṃ madhyamaṃ śiraḥ / āruhyābhugnaśirasaḥ praṇanartoruvikramaḥ //	Laying hold of the middle hood of their chief with both his hands, he bent it down, and set his foot upon the hitherto unbended head, and danced upon it in triumph.
prāṇāḥ phaṇe 'bhavaṃścāsya kṛṣṇasyāṅghrinikuṭṭanaiḥ / yatronnatiṃ ca kurute nanāmāsya tataḥ śiraḥ // mūrchāmupāyayau bhrāntyā nāgaḥ kṛṣṇasya recakaiḥ / daṇḍapātanipātena vavāma rudhiraṃ bahu //	Wherever the snake attempted to raise his head, it was again trodden down, and many bruises were inflicted on the hood by the pressure of the toes of Kṛṣṇa. Trampled upon by the feet of Kṛṣṇa, as they changed position in the dance, the snake fainted, and vomited forth much blood.
taṃ vibhigraśirogrīvamāsyebhyasmutaśoṇitam / vilokya karuṇaṃ jagmustatpatnyo madhusūdanam //	Beholding the head and neck of their lord thus injured, and the blood flowing from his mouth, the females of the snakeking implored the clemency of Madhusūdana.
nāgapatnya ūcuḥ jñāto 'si devadeveśa sarvajñastvamanuttamaḥ / paraṃ jyotiracintyaṃ yattadaṃśaḥ parameśvaraḥ //	“Thou art recognised, O god of gods!” they exclaimed “thou art the sovereign of all thou art light supreme, inscrutable thou art the mighty lord, the portion of that supreme light.
na samarthāḥ surāḥstotuṃ yamananyabhavaṃ vibhum / svarūpavarṇanaṃ tasya kathaṃ yoṣitkariṣyati // yasyākhilamahīrvyomajalāgnipavanātmakam / brahmāṇḍamalpakālpāṃśaḥ stoṣyāmastaṃ kathaṃ vayam // yamato na vidurnityaṃ yatsvarūpaṃ hi yoginaḥ / paramārthamaṇoralpaṃ sthūlātsthūlaṃ natāḥ sma tam // na yasya janmane dhātā yasya cāntāya nāntakaḥ / sthitikartā na cānyosti yasya tasmai namaḥsadā //	The gods themselves are unable worthily to praise thee, the lord selfexistent how then shall females proclaim thy nature? How shall we fully declare him of whom the egg of Brahmā, made up of earth, sky, water, fire, and air, is but a small portion of a part? Holy sages have in vain sought to know thy eternal essence. We bow to that form which is the most subtile of atoms, the largest of the large to him whose birth is without a creator, whose end knows no destroyer, and who alone is the cause of duration.
kopaḥ svalpo 'pi te nāsti sthitipālanameva te / kāraṇaṃ kāliya syāsya damane śruyatāṃ vacaḥ //	There is no wrath in thee for thine is the protection of the world and hence this chastisement of Kālīya. Yet hear us.
striyonukaṃpyāḥsādhūnāṃ mūḍhā dīnāś ca jantavaḥ / yatastatosya dīnasya kṣamyatāṃ kṣamatāṃvara //	Women are to be regarded with pity by the virtuous animals are humanely treated even by fools. Let therefore the author of wisdom have compassion upon this poor creature.
samasta jagadāvāro bhavānalpabalaḥ phaṇī / tvatpādapīḍito jahyānmuhūrtārdhana jīvitam //	Thyself, as an oviparous, hooded snake, art the upholder of the world. Oppressed by thee, he will speedily perish.
kva pannago' lpavīryo 'yaṃ kva bhavānbhuvanāśrayaḥ / prītidveṣau samotkṛṣṭagocarau bhavato 'vyaya //	What is this feeble serpent, compared to thee in whom the universe reposes? Friendship and enmity are felt towards equals and superiors, not for those infinitely beneath us.
tataḥ kuru jagatsvāminprasādamavasīdataḥ / prāṇāṃstyajati nāgo 'yaṃ bhartṛbhikṣā pradīyatām // bhuvaneśa jagannātha mahāpuruṣapūrvaja / prāṇāṃstyajati nāgo 'yaṃ bhartṛbhikṣāṃ prayaccha naḥ //	Then, sovereign of the world, have mercy upon us.

ityukte tābhir āśvasya klāntadehopi pannagaḥ / prasīda devadeveti prāha vākyaṃ śanaiḥ śanaiḥ //	When they had thus spoken, the Nāga himself, almost exanimate, repeated feebly their solicitations for mercy.

How shall I address thee, who art possessed, through thine own strength and essence, of the eight great faculties, in energy unequalled? Thou art the supreme, the progenitor of the supreme Brahmā thou art the supreme spirit, and from thee the supreme proceeds thou art beyond all finite objects how can I speak thy praise? How can I declare his greatness, from whom cone Brahmā, Rudra, Candra, Indra, the Maruts, the Aswins, the Vasus, and Ādityas of whom the whole world is an infinitely small portion, a portion destined to represent his essence and whose nature, primitive or derived, Brahmā and the immortals do not comprehend? How can I approach him, to whom the gods offer incense and flowers culled from the groves of Nandana whose incarnate forms the king of the deities ever adores, unconscious of his real person whom the sages, that have withdrawn their senses from all external objects, worship in thought, and enshrining his image in the purposes of their hearts, present to it the flowers of sanctity? I am quite unable, O god of gods, to worship or to hymn thee.
so 'haṃ te devadeveśa nārcanādau stutau na ca / sāmarthyavān kṛpāmātramanovṛttiḥ prasīda me //	Thy own clemency must alone influence thy mind to shew me compassion.
sarpajātiriyaṃ krurā yasyāṃ jātosmi keśava / tatsvabhāvo 'yamatrāsti nāparādho mamācyuta //	It is the nature of snakes to be savage, and I am born of their kind hence this is my nature, not mine offence.
sṛjyate bhavatā sarvaṃ tathā saṃhrīyate jagat / jātirūpasvabhāvāś ca sṛjyante sṛjatā tvayā //	The world is created, as it is destroyed, by thee and the species, form, and nature of all things in the world are thy work.
yathāhaṃ bhavatā sṛṣṭo jātyā rūpeṇa ceśvara / svabhāvena ca sādhutvaṃ tathedaṃ ceṣṭitaṃ mayā // yadyanyathā pravarteyaṃ devadeva tato mayi / nyāyo daṇḍanipāto vai tavaivavacanaṃ yathā //	Even such as thou hast created me in kind, in form, and in nature, such I am, and such are my actions should I act differently, then indeed should I deserve thy punishment, for so thou hast declared. Yet that I have been punished by thee is indeed a blessing for punishment from thee alone is a favour.
hatavīryo hataviṣo damito 'haṃ tvayācyuta / jīvitaṃ dīyatāmekamājñāpaya karomi kim // śrībhagavānuvāca	Behold I am now without strength, without poison deprived of both by thee. Spare me my life I ask no more. Command me what I shall do.”

gate sarpe pariṣvajya mṛtaṃ punarivāgatam / gopā mūrdhani hārdena siṣicur netrajair jalaiḥ // kṛṣṇāmākliṣṭakarmāṇamanye vismitacetasaḥ / tuṣṭuvurmuditā gopā dṛṣṭvā śivajalāṃ nadīm //	When the snake was gone, the Gopas hailed Govinda, as one risen from the dead, and embraced him, and bathed his forehead with tears of joy others, contemplating the water of the river, now freed from peril, were filled with wonder, and sang the praise of Kṛṣṇa, who is unaffected by works.
gīyamānaḥ sa gopībhiścāritaiḥ sādhuceṣṭitaiḥ / saṃstūyamāno gopaiś ca kṛṣṇo vrajamupāgamat //	Thus eminent by his glorious exploits, and eulogized by the Gopas and Gopas, Kṛṣṇa returned to Vraja.
gāḥ pālayantau ca punaḥ sahitau balakeśavau / bhramamāṇau vane tasminramyaṃ tālavanaṃ gatau // tattu tālavanaṃ divyaṃ dhenuko nāma dānavaḥ / mṛgamāṃsakṛtāhāraḥ sadādhyāste kharākṛtiḥ //	AGAIN, tending upon the herds, Keśava and Rāma wandered through the woods, and on one occasion came to a pleasing grove of palms, where dwelt the fierce demon Dhenuka, feeding upon the flesh of deer.
tattu tālavanaṃ pakvaphalasaṃpatsamanvitam / dṛṣṭvā spṛhānvitā gopā phalādāne 'bruvanvacaḥ // gopā ūcuḥ he rāma he kṛṣṇa sadā dhenukenaiṣa rakṣyate / bhūpradeśo yatastasmātpakvānīmāni saṃti vai // phalāni paśya tālānāṃ gandhāmoditadiṃśi vai / vayametānyabhīpsāmaḥ pātyantāṃ yadi rocate //	Beholding the trees covered with fruit, and desirous of gathering it, the cowherds called out to the brothers, and said, “See, Rāma see, Kṛṣṇa in this grove, belonging to the great Dhenuka, the trees are loaded with ripe fruit, the smell of which perfumes the air we should like to eat some.
iti gopakumārāṇāṃ śrutvā saṃkarṣaṇo vacaḥ / etatkartavyamityuktvā pātayāmāsa tāni vai / kṛṣṇaś ca pātayāmāsa bhuvitāni phalāni vai //	Will you throw some down?” As soon as the boys had spoken, Saṅkarṣaṇa and Kṛṣṇa shook the trees, and brought down the fruit on the ground.
phalānāṃ patatāṃ śabdamākarṇya sudurāsadaḥ / ājagāma sa duṣṭātmā kopāddaiteyagardabhaḥ //	Hearing the noise of the falling fruit, the fierce and malignant demon Dhenuka, in the form of an ass, hastened to the spot in a great passion, and began to kick Rāma on the breast with his hinder heels.
gṛhītvā bhrāmayāmāsa soṃ'bare gatajīvitam / tasminneva sa cikṣepa vegena tṛṇarājani // tataḥ phalānyanekāni tālāgrānnipatankharaḥ / pṛthivyāṃ pātayāmāsa mahāvāto ghanāniva //	Rāma, however, seized him by both hind legs, and whirling him round until he expired, tossed his carcass to the top of a palm tree, from the branches of which it struck down abundance of fruit, like rain drops poured upon earth by the wind.

tato gāvo nirābādhāstasmiṃstalavane dvija / navaśaṣvaṃ sukhaṃ ceruryanna bhuktamabhūtpurā //	Henceforward the cattle grazed unobstructed in the palm grove, and cropped the new pasturage, where they had never before ventured.
śrīparāśara uvāca	Sports of the boys in the forest.

What shall I do? Tell me, Madhusūdana the villain runs away with speed!” Kṛṣṇa opened his mouth, smiling, for he well knew the might of the son of Rohiṇī, and replied, “Why this subtle pretext of merely mortal nature? thou who art the soul of all the most subtile of subtile things.
smarāśeṣajagadbījakāraṇaṃ kāraṇāgraja / ātmānamekaṃ tadvacca jagatyekārṇave ca yat //	Remember yourself, the radical cause of the whole world born before all cause, and all that is alone when the world is destroyed.

As the waters of the sea, when swallowed up by submarine flame, are recovered by the winds, and thrown, in the form of snow, upon the Himācala, where coming into contact with the rays of the sun, they reassume their watery nature so the world, being devoured by thee at the period of dissolution, becomes of necessity, at the end of every Kalpa, the world again, through thy creative efforts.
bhavānahaṃ ca viśvātmannekameva ca kāraṇam / jagatosya jagatyarthe bhedenāvāṃ vyavasthitau //	Thou and I, soul of the universe, are but one and the same cause of the creation of the earth, although, for its protection, we exist in distinct individuals.

tayorviharatorevaṃ rāmakeśavayorvraje / prāvṛḍ vyatītā vikasatsarojā cābhavaccharat //	WHILST Keśava and Rāma were sporting thus in Vraja, the rainy season ended, and was succeeded by the season of autumn, when the lotus is full blown.
avāpustāpamatyarthaṃ śapharyaḥ palvalodake / putrakṣetrādisaktena mamatvena yathā gṛhī //	The small Saphari fish, in their watery burrows, were oppressed by the heat, like a man by selfish desires, who is devoted to his family.

The clouds, of shining whiteness, exhausted of their watery wealth, deserted the atmosphere, like those who have acquired wisdom, and depart from their homes. Evaporated by the rays of the autumnal sun, the lakes were dried up, like the hearts of men when withered by the contact of selfishness.
kumudaiḥ śaradaṃbhāṃsi yogyatālakṣaṇaṃ yayuḥ / avabodhair manāṃsīva samatvamamalātmanām //	The pellucid waters of the season were suitably embellished by white waterlilies, as are the minds of the pure by the apprehension of truth.

pūrvaṃ tyaktaiḥ saroṃbhobhir haṃsā yogaṃ punar yayuḥ / kleśaiḥ kuyogino śeṣair antarāyahatā iva //	First abandoned by the waters of the lake, the swans again began to congregate, like false ascetics, whose devotions are interrupted, and they are again assailed by innumerable afflictions.
nibhṛto bhavadatyarthaṃ samudraḥstimitodakaḥ / kramāvāptamahāyogo viścalātmā yathā yatiḥ //	The ocean was still and calm, and exhibited no undulations, like the perfect sage, who has completed his course of restraint, and has acquired undisturbed tranquillity of spirit.
sarvatrātiprasannāni salilāni tathābhavan / jñāte sarvagate viṣṇau manāṃsīva sumedhasām //	Every where the waters were as clear and pure as the minds of the wise, who behold Viṣṇu in all things.

The moon allayed the fervours of the sun, as discrimination alleviates the pain to which egotism gives birth.
nabhasobdaṃ bhuvaḥ paṅkaṃ kāluṣyaṃ cāṃbhasaḥ śarat / indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyaḥ pratyāhāra ivāharat //	The clouds of the atmosphere, the muddiness of the earth, the discoloration of the waters, were all removed by autumn, as abstraction detaches the senses from the objects of perception.

yo yasya phalamaśranvai pūjayatyaparaṃ naraḥ / iha ca pretya caivāsau na tadāpnoti śobhanam //	He who worships the deity of another, and diverts from him the reward that is his due, obtains not a prosperous station either in this world or in the next.
kṛṣyāntā prathitā sīmā mīmāntaṃ ca punarvanam / vanāntā girayaḥsarve te cāsmākaṃ parā gatiḥ //	Where the land ceases to be cultivated there are bounds assigned, beyond which commences the forest the forests are bounded by the hills, and so far do our limits extend.

vyabhre nabhasi devendre vitathātmavacasyatha / niṣkramya gokulaṃ hṛṣṭaṃ svasthānaṃ punarāgamat //	The threats of Indra having been fruitless, and the heavens clear, all Gokula came forth from its shelter, and returned to its own abode.
mumoca kṛṣṇopi tadā govardhanamahācalam / svasthāne vismitamukhair dṛṣṭas tais tu vrajaukasaiḥ //	Then Kṛṣṇa, in the sight of the surprised inhabitants of the forests, restored the great mountain Govarddhana to its original site.

When Indra had, by direction of the kine, inaugurated Kṛṣṇa, the husband of Śacī said to him affectionately, “I have thus performed what the cows enjoined me.

For his sake I will restore to Kunti all her sons with Yudhiṣṭhira at their head, unharmed, when the Bhārata war is at an end.”
ityuktaḥ saṃpariṣvajya devārājo janārdanam / āruhyaurāvataṃ nāgaṃ punareva divaṃ yayau //	Upon Kṛṣṇas ceasing to speak, he and Indra mutually embraced and the latter, mounting his elephant Airāvata, returned to heaven.
kṛṣṇo hi sahito gobhir gopālaiś ca punarvrajam / ājagāmātha gopīnāṃ dṛṣṭipūtena vartmanā //	Kṛṣṇa, with the cattle and the herdsmen, went his way to Vraja, where the wives of the Gopas watched for his approach.

bālakrīḍeyamatulā gopālatvaṃ jugupsitam / divyaṃ ca bhavataḥ karma kimetattāta kathyatām //	Tell us what is the meaning of all this.

satyaṃ satyaṃ hareḥ pādau śapāmo 'mita vikrama / yathāvadvīryamālokya na tvāṃ manyāmahe naram //	Assuredly we repose at the feet of Hari, O thou of unbounded might! for, having witnessed thy power, we cannot believe thee to be a man.
prītiḥsastrīkumārasya vrajasya tvayi keśava / karma cedamaśakyaṃ yatsamastais tridaśerapi // bālatvaṃ cātivīryatvaṃ janma cāsmāsu śobhanam / cintyamānamameyātmañchaṅkāṃ kṛṣṇa prayacchati //	Thy affection, Keśava, for our women and children, and for Vraja the deeds that thou hast wrought, which all the gods would have attempted in vain thy boyhood, and thy prowess thy humiliating birth amongst us are contradictions that fill us with doubt, whenever we think of them.
kṣaṇaṃ bhūtvā tvasau tūṣṇīṃ kiñcitpraṇayakopavān / ity evam uktas tair gopaiḥ kṛṣṇo 'py āha mahāmatiḥ // śrībhagavānuvāca matsaṃbandhena vo gopā yadi lajjā na jāyate / ślāghyo vāhaṃ tataḥ kiṃ vo vicāreṇa prayojanam // yadi vo 'sti mayi prītiḥ ślāghyo 'haṃ bhavatāṃ yadi / tadātmabandhusadṛśī buddhirvaḥ kriyātāṃ mayi //	Yet reverence be to thee, whether thou be a god, or a demon, or a Yakṣa, or a Gandharva, or whatever we may deem thee for thou art our friend.” When they had ended, Kṛṣṇa remained silent for some time, as if hurt and offended, and then replied to them, “Herdsmen, if you are not ashamed of my relationship if I have merited your praise what occasion is there for you to engage in any discussion concerning me? If you have any regard for me if I have deserved your praise then be satisfied to know that I am your kinsman.
nāhaṃ devo na gāndharvo na yakṣo na ca dānavaḥ / ahaṃ vo bāndhavo jāto naitaccintyamito 'nyathā // śrīparāśara uvāca iti śrutvā harervākyaṃ baddhamaunāstato vanam / yayurgopā mahābhāga tasmanpraṇayakopini //	I am neither god, nor Yakṣa, nor Gandharva, nor Dānava I have been born your relative, and you must not think differently of me.” Upon receiving this answer, the Gopas held their peace, and went into the woods, leaving Kṛṣṇa apparently displeased.
kṛṣṇastu vimalaṃ vyoma śaraccandrasya candrikām / tadā kumudinīṃ phullāmāmoditadigantarām // vanarājīṃ tathā kūjandbhṛṅgamālāmanoharām / vilokya saha gopībhir manaścakre ratiṃ prati //	But Kṛṣṇa, observing the clear sky bright with the autumnal moon, and the air perfumed with the fragrance of the wild waterlily, in whose buds the clustering bees were murmuring their songs, felt inclined to join with the Gopīs in sport.
vinā rāmeṇa madhuramatīva vanitāpriyam / jagau kalapadaṃ śauristāramandrakṛtakramam // ramyaṃ gītadhvaniṃ śrutvā saṃtyajyāvasathāṃstadā / ājagmustvaritā gopyo yatrāste madhusūdanaḥ //	Accordingly he and Rāma commenced singing sweet low strains in various measures, such as the women loved and they, as soon as they heard the melody, quitted their homes, and hastened to meet the foe of Madhu.
kācitkṛṣṇetikṛṣṇeti proktvā lajjāmupāyayau / yayau ca kācitpremāndhā tatpārśvamavilaṃbitam // kāciccāvasathasyānte sthitvā dṛṣṭvā bahirgurum / tanmayatvena govindaṃ dadhyau mīlitalocanā // taccittavimalāhlādakṣīṇapuṇyacayā tathā / tadaprāptimahāduḥkhavilīnāśeṣapātakā // cintayatī jagatsūtiṃ parabrahmasvarūpiṇam / nirucchvāsatayā muktiṃ gatānyā gopakanyakā //	One damsel gently sang an accompaniment to his song another attentively listened to his melody one calling out upon his name, then shrunk abashed whilst another, more bold, and instigated by affection, pressed close to his side one, as she sallied forth, beheld some of the seniors of the family, and dared not venture, contenting herself with meditating on Kṛṣṇa with closed eyes, and entire devotion, by which immediately all acts of merit were effaced by rapture, and all sin was expiated by regret at not beholding him and others, again, reflecting upon the cause of the world, in the form of the supreme Brahma, obtained by their sighing final emancipation.
gopīparivṛto rātriṃ śaraccandramanoramām / mānayāmāsa govindo rāsāraṃbharasotsukaḥ //	Thus surrounded by the Gopīs, Kṛṣṇa thought the lovely moonlight night of autumn propitious to the Rasa dance.
gopyaś ca vṛndaśaḥ kṛṣṇaceṣṭāsvāyattamūrtayaḥ / anyadeśaṃ gate kṛṣṇe cerurvṛndāvanāntaram //	Many of the Gopīs imitated the different actions of Kṛṣṇa, and in his absence wandered through Vrindavan, representing his person.
kṛṣṇo 'hameṣa lalitaṃ vrajāmyālokyatāṃ gatiḥ / anyā bravīnti kṛṣṇasya mama gītirniśamyatām // duṣṭakāliya tiṣṭhātra kṛṣṇohamiti cāparā / bāhumāsphoṭya kṛṣṇasya līlayā sarvamādade //	“I am Kṛṣṇa,” cries one “behold the elegance of my movements.” “I am Kṛṣṇa,” exclaims another “listen to my song.” “Vile Kālīya, stay! for I am Kṛṣṇa,” is repeated by a third, slapping her arms in defiance.
anyā bravīti bho gopā niḥśaṅkaiḥ sthīyatāmiti / alaṃ vṛṣṭibhayenātra dhṛto govardhano mayā // dhenuko 'yaṃ mayākṣipto vicarantu yathecchayā / gāvo bravīti caivānyā kṛṣṇalīlānusāriṇī // evaṃ nānāprakārāsu kṛṣṇaceṣṭa su tāstadā / gopyo vyagrāḥsamaṃ cerū ramyaṃ vṛndāvanāntaram //	A fourth calls out, “Herdsmen, fear nothing be steady the danger of the storm is over, for, lo, I lift up Govarddhana for your shelter.” And a fifth proclaims, “Now let the herds graze where they will, for I have destroyed Dhenuka.” Thus in various actions of Kṛṣṇa the Gopīs imitated him, whilst away, and beguiled their sorrow by mimicking his sports.
vilokyaikā bhuvaṃ prāha gopī gopavarāṅganā / pulakāñcitasarvāṅgī vikāsinayanotpalā // dhvajabajrāṅkuśābjāṅkarekhāvantyāli paśyata / padānyetāni kṛṣṇasya līlālalitagāminaḥ //	Looking down upon the ground, one damsel calls to her friend, as the light down upon her body stands erect with joy, and the lotuses of her eyes expand, “See here are the marks of Kṛṣṇas feet, as he has gone alone sportively, and left the impressions of the banner, fife thunderbolt, and the goad.
kāpi tena samāyātā kṛtapuṇyā madālasā / padāni tasyāścaitāni ghanānyalpatanūni ca // puṣpāpacayamatroccaiś cakre dāmodare dhruvam / yenāgrākrāntamātrāṇi padānyatra mahātmanaḥ //	What lovely maiden has been his companion, inebriate with passion, as her irregular footmarks testify? Here Dāmodara has gathered flowers from on high, for we see alone the impressions of the tips of his feet.
atropaviśya vai tena kācitpuṣpair alaṅkṛtā / anyajanmani sarvātmā viṣṇur abhyarcitas tayā //	Here a nymph has sat down with him, ornamented with flowers, fortunate in having propitiated Viṣṇu in a prior existence.
puṣpabandhanasaṃmānakṛtamānāmapāsya tām / nandagopasuto yāto mārgeṇānena paśyata // anuyātainamatrānyā nitaṃbabharamantharā / yā gantavye drutaṃ yāti nimnapādāgrasaṃsthitiḥ // hastanyastāgrahasteyaṃ tena yāti tathā sakhī / anāyattapadanyāsā lakṣyate padapaddhatiḥ // hastasaṃsparśamātreṇa dhūrtenaiṣā vimānitā / nairāśyānmandagāminyā nivṛttaṃ lakṣyate padam //	Having left her in an arrogant mood, because he had offered her flowers, the son of Nanda has gone by this road for see, unable to follow him with equal steps, his associate has here tripped along upon her toes, and, holding his hand, the damsel has passed, as is evident from the uneven and intermingled footsteps. But the rogue has merely taken her hand, and left her neglected, for here the paces indicate the path of a person in despair.
nūnamuktā tvarāmīti punareṣyāmitentikam / tena kṛṣṇena yenaiṣā tvaritā padapaddhatiḥ //	Undoubtedly he promised that he would quickly come again, for here are his own footsteps returning with speed.
praviṣṭo gahanaṃ kṛṣṇaḥ padamatra na lakṣyate / nivartadhvaṃ śaśāṅkasya naitaddī dhitigocare // nivṛttāstāstadā gopyo nirāśāḥ kṛṣṇadarśane / yamunātīramāsādya jagustaccaritaṃ tathā // tato dadṛśurāyāntaṃ vikāsimukhapaṅkajam / gopyas trailokyagoptāraṃ kṛṣṇamakliṣṭaceṣṭitam // kācidālokya govindamāyāntamatiharṣitā / kṛṣṇākṛṣṇeti kṛṣṇeti prāha nānyadudīrayat // kācidbhrūbhaṅguraṃ kṛtvā lalāṭaphalakaṃ harim / vilokya netrabhṛṅgābhyāṃ papau tanmukhapaṅkajam //	Here he has entered the thick forest, impervious to the rays of the moon, and his steps can be traced no farther.” Hopeless then of beholding Kṛṣṇa, the Gopīs returned, and repaired to the banks of the Yamunā, where they sang his songs and presently they beheld the preserver of the three worlds, with a smiling aspect, hastening towards them on which, one exclaimed, “Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!” unable to articulate any thing else another affected to contract her forehead with frowns, as drinking with the bees of her eyes the lotus of the face of Hari another, closing her eyelids, contemplated internally his form, as if engaged in an act of devotion.
tataḥ kāñcit priyālāpaiḥ kāñcid bhrūbhaṅgavīkṣitaiḥ / ninye 'nunayamanyāṃ ca karasparśena mādhavaḥ //	Then Mādhava, coming amongst them, conciliated some with soft speeches, some with gentle looks, and some he took by the hand and the illustrious deity sported with them in the stations of the dance.
rāsamaṇḍalabandhopi kṛṣṇapārśvamanujjhatā / gopījanena naivābhūdekasthānasthirātmanā // hastena gṛhya caikaikāṃ gopīnāṃ rāsamaṇḍale / cakāra tatkarasparśanimīlitadṛśaṃ hariḥ //	As each of the Gopīs, however, attempted to keep in one place, close to the side of Kṛṣṇa, the circle of the dance could not be constructed, and he therefore took each by the hand, and when their eyelids were shut by the effects of such touch, the circle was formed.
tataḥ pravavṛte rāsaścaladvalayanisvanaḥ / anuyātaśaratkāvyagoyagītiranukramāt //	Then proceeded the dance to the music of their clashing bracelets, and songs that celebrated in suitable strain the charms of the autumnal season.
kṛṣṇaḥ śaraccandramasaṃ kaumudīṃ kumudākaram / jagau gopījanastveka kṛṣṇanāma punaḥpunaḥ // parivṛttiśrameṇaikā caladvalayalāpinīm / dadau bāhulatāṃ skandhe gopī madhunighātinaḥ // kācitpravilasadbāhuṃ parirabhya cucuṃba tam / gopīgītastutivyājānnipuṇā madhusūdanam //	Kṛṣṇa sang the moon of autumn, a mine of gentle radiance but the nymphs repeated the praises of Kṛṣṇa alone. At times, one of them, wearied by the revolving dance, threw her arms, ornamented with tinkling bracelets, round the neck of the destroyer of Madhu another, skilled in the art of singing his praises, embraced him.
gopīkapolasaṃśleṣamabhigamya harerbhujau / pulakodgamasasyāya svedāṃbughanatāṃ gatau //	The drops of perspiration from the arms of Hari were like fertilizing rain, which produced a crop of down upon the temples of the Gopīs.
rāsageyaṃ jagau kṛṣṇo yāvattārataradhvaniḥ / sādhu kṛṣṇeti kṛṣṇeti tāvattā dviguṇaṃ jaguḥ //	Kṛṣṇa sang the strain that was appropriate to the dance. The Gopīs repeatedly exclaimed, “Bravo, Kṛṣṇa!” to his song.
gatenugamanaṃ cakrurvalanaṃ saṃmukhaṃ yayuḥ / pratilomānulomābhyāṃ bhejurgaupāṅganā harim //	When leading, they followed him when returning, they encountered him and, whether he went forwards or backwards, they ever attended on his steps.
tā vāryamāṇāḥ patibhiḥ pitṛbhir bhrātṛbhis tathā / kṛṣṇaṃ gopāṅganā rātrau ramayanti ratipriyāḥ // so 'pi kaiśorakavayo mānayanmadhusūdanaḥ / reme tābhir ameyātmā kṣapāsukṣapitāhitaḥ //	Whilst frolicking thus with the Gopīs, they considered every instant without him a myriad of years and, prohibited in vain by husbands, fathers, brothers, they went forth at night to sport with Kṛṣṇa, the object of their affection.
tadbhartṛṣu tathā tāsu sarvabhūteṣu ceśvaraḥ / ātmasvarūparūpo 'sau vyāpī vāyuriva sthitaḥ // yathā samastabhūteṣu nabhogniḥ pṛthivī jalam / vāyuścātmā tathaivāsau vyāpya sarvamavasthitaḥ // iti śrīviṣṇumahāpurāṇe pañcamāṃśe trayodaśodhyāyaḥ	Thus the illimitable being, the benevolent remover of all imperfections, assumed the character of a youth amongst the females of the herdsmen of Vraja pervading their natures, and that of their lords, by his own essence, all diffusive like the wind for even as in all creatures the elements of ether, fire, earth, water, and air, are comprehended, so also is he every where present, and in all.
śrīparāśara vāca pradoṣāgro kadācittu rāsāsakte janārdane / trāsayansamado gauṣṭhamariṣṭasamupāgamat //	ONE evening, whilst Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs were amusing themselves in the dance, the demon Aṛṣṭa, disguised as a savage bull, came to the spot, after having spread alarm through the station.
sa toyatoyadacchāyastīkṣṇaśṛṅgorkalocanaḥ / khurāgrapātair atyarthaṃ dārayandhāraṇītalam // lelihānaḥsaniṣpeṣaṃ jihvayoṣṭhau punaḥpunaḥ / saṃraṃbhāviddhalāṅgūlaḥ kaṭhinaskandhabandhanaḥ // udagrakakudābhogapramāṇo duratikramaḥ / viṇmū6traliptapṛṣṭhāṅgo gavamudvegakārakaḥ // pralaṃbakaṇṭho 'timukhastarukhātāṅkitānanaḥ / pātayansa gāvaṃ garbhandaityo vṛṣabharūpadhṛk //	His colour was that of a cloud charged with rain he had vast horns, and his eyes were like two fiery suns as he moved, he ploughed up the ground with his hoofs his tongue was repeatedly licking his lips his tail was erect the sinews of his shoulders were firm, and between them rose a hump of enormous dimensions his haunches were soiled with ordure, and he was a terror to the herds his dewlap hung low, and his face was marked with scars from butting against the trees. Terrifying all the kine, the demon who perpetually haunts the forests in the shape of a bull, destroying hermits and ascetics, advanced.
tatastamatighorākṣamavekṣyātibhayāturāḥ / gopā gopastriyaścaiva kṛṣṇakṛṣṇeti cukruśuḥ //	Beholding an animal of such a formidable aspect, the herdsmen and their women were exceedingly frightened, and called aloud on Kṛṣṇa, who came to their succour, shouting and slapping his arm in defiance.
siṃhanādaṃ tataś cakre talaśabdaṃ ca keśavaḥ / tacchabda śravaṇāccāsau dāmodaramupāyayau //	When the Daitya heard the noise, he turned upon his challenger, and fixing his eyes and pointing his horns at the belly of Keśava, he ran furiously upon the youth.
agranyastaviṣāṇāgraḥ kṛṣṇakukṣikṛtekṣaṇaḥ / abhyadhāvata duṣṭātmā kṛṣṇaṃ vṛṣabhadānavaḥ //	Kṛṣṇa stirred not from his post, but, smiling in sport and derision, awaited the near approach of the bull, when he seized him as an alligator would have done, and held him firmly by the horns, whilst he pressed his sides with his knees.

tuṣṭuvur nihate tasmin daitye gopā janārdanam / jaṃbhe hate sahasrākṣaṃ purā devagaṇā yathā //	Seeing him slain, the herdsmen glorified Kṛṣṇa, as the companies of the celestials of old praised Indra, when he triumphed over the Asura Jambha.

bho bho dānapate vākyaṃ kriyatāṃ prītaye mama / itaḥ syandanamāruhya gamyatāṃ nandagokulam //	Ascend your chariot, and go hence to the station of the herdsman Nanda.

tathetyaktvā ca rājānaṃ rathamāruhya śobhanam / niścakrāma tataḥ puryā mathurāyā madhupriyaḥ //	Being thus instructed, the illustrious Akrūra readily undertook to visit Kṛṣṇa, and, ascending his stately chariot, he went forth from the city of Mathurā.

sa khurakṣatabhūpṛṣṭhaḥsaṭākṣepadhutāṃbudaḥ / drutavikrāntacandrārkamārgo gopānupādravat //	He came in the shape of a steed, spurning the earth with his hoofs, scattering the clouds with his mane, and springing in his paces beyond the orbits of the sun and moon.
tasya deṣitaśabdena gopālā daityavājinaḥ / gopyaś ca bhayasaṃvignā govindaṃ śaraṇaṃ yayuḥ //	The cowherds and their females, hearing his neighings, were struck with terror, and fled to Govinda for protection, calling upon him to save them.

What is there to apprehend from one of such little might, whose neighings are his only terrors a galloping and vicious steed, who is ridden by the strength of the Daityas? Come on, wretch—I am Kṛṣṇa—and I will knock all thy teeth down thy throat, as the wielder of the trident did to Pūṣan.” Thus defying him to combat, Govinda went to encounter Keśin.

kṛṣṇasya vavṛdhe bāhuḥ keśidehagato dvija / vināśāya yathā vyādhirāsaṃbhūterupekṣitaḥ //	Still the arm of Kṛṣṇa, in the throat of the demon, continued to enlarge, like a malady increasing from its commencement till it ends in dissolution.

See how he gently smiles at the gestures of Muṣṭika and Cāṇūra, as they spring up.
sakhyaḥ paśyata cāṇūraṃ niyuddhārthamayaṃ hariḥ / samupaiti na saṃtyatra kiṃ vṛddhā muktakārimaḥ //	And now behold Hari advance to encounter Cāṇūra.

How can the delicate form of Hari, only yet in the dawn of adolescence, be regarded as a match for the vast and adamantine bulk of the great demon? Two youths, of light and elegant persons, are in the arena, to oppose athletic fiends, headed by the cruel Cāṇūra.
niyuddhaprāśnikānāṃ tu mahāneṣa vyatikramaḥ / yadbālabalinor yuddhaṃ madhyasthaiḥ samupekṣyate //	This is a great sin in the judges of the games, for the umpires to suffer a contest between boys and strong men.”

Balabhadra also danced, slapping his arms in defiance.
cāṇūreṇa tataḥ kṛṣṇo yayudhe 'mitavikramaḥ / niyuddhakuśalo daityau balabhadreṇa muṣṭikaḥ //	Where the ground was firm, the invincible Kṛṣṇa contended foot to foot with Cāṇūra. The practised demon Muṣṭika was opposed by Balabhadra.
sannipātāvadhūtais tu cāṇūreṇa samaṃ hariḥ / prakṣepaṇair muṣṭibhiś ca kīlavajranipātanaiḥ // pādoddhūtaiḥ pramṛṣṭaiś ca tayoryuddham abhūn mahat //	Mutually entwining, and pushing, and pulling, and beating each other with fists, arms, and elbows, pressing each other with their knees, interlacing their arms, kicking with their feet, pressing with their whole weight upon one another, fought Hari and Cāṇūra.
aśastramatighoraṃ tat tayor yuddhaṃ sudāruṇam / balaprāṇaviniṣpādyaṃ samājotsavasannidhau //	Desperate was the struggle, though without weapons, and one for life and death, to the great gratification of the spectators.

Beholding Cāṇūra losing, and Kṛṣṇa gaining strength, Kansa, furious with rage, commanded the music to cease.
mṛdaṅgādiṣu tūryeṣu pratiṣiddheṣu tatkṣaṇāt / khe saṃgatānyavādyanta devatūryāṇyanekaśaḥ // jaya govinda cāṇūraṃ jahi keśava dānavam / antardhānagatā devāstamūcuratiharṣitāḥ // cāṇūreṇa ciraṃ kālaṃ pīḍitvā madhusūdanaḥ / utpāṭya bhramayāmāsa tadvadhāya kṛto dyamaḥ //	As soon as the drums and trumpets were silenced, a numerous band of heavenly instruments was heard in the sky, and the gods invisibly exclaimed, “Victory to Govinda! Keśava, kill the demon Cāṇūra!” Madhusūdana having for a long time dallied with his adversary, at last lifted him up, and whirled him round, with the intention of putting an end to him.
bhrāmayitvā śataguṇaṃ daityamallamamitrajit / bhūbhāvātphoṭayāmāsa gagane gatajīvitam // bhūmāvāsphoṭitastenacāṇūraḥ śatadhābhavat / raktasrāvamahāpaṅkāṃ cakāra ca tadā bhavam //	Having whirled Cāṇūra round a hundred times, until his breath was expended in the air, Kṛṣṇa dashed him on the ground with such violence as to smash his body into a hundred fragments, and strew the earth with a hundred pools of gory mire.
baladevo 'pi tatkālaṃ muṣṭikena mahābalaḥ / yayudhe daityamallena cāṇūreṇa yathā hariḥ //	Whilst this took place, the mighty Baladeva was engaged in the same manner with the demon bruiser Muṣṭika.
so 'pyenaṃ muṣṭinā mūrdhni vakṣasyāhatya jānunā / pātayitvā dharāpṛṣṭhe niṣpipeṣa gatāyuṣam //	Striking him on the head with his fists, and on the breast with his knees, he stretched him on the ground, and pummelled him there till he was dead.
kṛṣṇa stośalakaṃ bhūyo mallarājaṃ mahābalam / vāmamuṣṭiprahāreṇa pātayāmāsa bhūtale //	Again, Kṛṣṇa encountered the royal bruiser Tomalaka, and felled him to the earth with a blow of his left hand.

nando 'pi gṛhyatāṃ pāpo nirgalair āyasair iha / avṛddhārhaima daṇḍena vasudevo 'pi badhyatām // valganti gopāḥ kṛṣṇena ye ceme sahitāḥ purāḥ / gāvo nigṛhya tāmeṣāṃ yaccāsti vasu kiñcana //	Kansa, his eyes reddening with wrath, called aloud to the surrounding people, “Drive those two cowboys out of the assembly seize the villain Nanda, and secure him with chains of iron put Vasudeva to death with tortures intolerable to his years and lay hands upon the cattle, and whatever else belongs to those cowherds who are the associates of Kṛṣṇa.”
evamājñāpayānaṃ tu prahasya madhusūdanaḥ / utplutyāruhya taṃ mañcaṃ kaṃsaṃ jagrāha vegataḥ // keśeṣvā kṛṣya vigalatkirīṭamavanītale / saṃ kaṃsaṃ pātayāmāsa tasyopari papāta ca //	Upon hearing these orders, the destroyer of Madhu laughed at Kansa, and, springing up to the place where he was seated, laid hold of him by the hair of his head, and struck his tiara to the ground then casting him down upon the earth, Govinda threw himself upon him.
aśeṣajagadādhāraguruṇā patatopari / kṛṣṇena tyājitaḥ prāṇānugrasenātmajo nṛpaḥ //	Crushed by the weight of the upholder of the universe, the son of Ugrasena, Kansa the king, gave up the ghost.
mṛtasya keśeṣu tadā gṛhītvā madhusūdanaḥ / cakarṣa dehaṃ kaṃsasya raṅgamadhye mahābalaḥ // gauravemātipatatā parighātena kṛṣyatā / kṛtā kaṃsasya dehena vegeneva mahāṃbhasaḥ // kaṃse gṛhīte kṛṣṇena tadbhrātābhyāgato ruṣā / sunāmā bala bhadreṇa līlayaiva nipātitaḥ //	Kṛṣṇa then dragged the dead body, by the hair of the head, into the centre of the arena, and a deep furrow was made by the vast and heavy carcass of Kansa, when it was dragged along the ground by Kṛṣṇa, as if a torrent of water had run through it. Seeing Kansa thus treated, his brother Sumālin came to his succour but he was encountered, and easily killed, by Balabhadra.
tato hāhākṛtaṃ sarvamāsīttadraṅgamaṇḍalam / avajñayā hataṃ dṛṣṭvā kṛṣṇena mathureśvaram //	Then arose a general cry of grief from the surrounding circle, as they beheld the king of Mathurā thus slain, and treated with such contumely, by Kṛṣṇa.
kṛṣṇe 'pi vasudevasya pādau jagrāha satvaraḥ / devakyāś ca mahābāhurbaladevasahāyavān // utthāpya vasudevastaṃ devakī ca janārdanam / smṛtajanmoktavacanau tāve va praṇatau sthitau // śrīvasudeva uvāca prasīda sīdatāṃ datto devānāṃ yo varaḥ prabho / tathāvayoḥ prasādena kṛtoddhāraḥsa keśava //	Kṛṣṇa, accompanied by Balabhadra, embraced the feet of Vasudeva and of Devakī but Vasudeva raised him up and he and Devakī recalling to recollection what he had said to them at his birth, they bowed to Janārddana, and the former thus addressed him “Have compassion upon mortals, O god, benefactor and lord of deities it is by thy favour to us two that thou hast become the present upholder of the world.
ārādhito yadbhagavānavatīrṇo gṛhe mama / durvṛttanidhanārthāya tena naḥ pāvitaṃ kulam //	That, for the punishment of the rebellious, thou hast descended upon earth in my house, having been propitiated by my prayers, sanctifies our race.

Thou, Achyuta, who comprehendest all the gods, art eternally worshipped with sacrifices thou art sacrifice itself, and the offerer of sacrifices.
sāpahnavaṃ mama mano yadetattvayi jāyate / devakyāścātmajaprītyā tadatyantaviḍaṃbanā //	The affection that inspires my heart and the heart of Devakī towards thee, as if thou wast our child, is indeed but error, and a great delusion.

Is it consistent that the lord of the world, from whom the world proceeds, should be born of me, except through illusion? How should he, in whom all fixed and moveable things are contained, be conceived in the womb and born of a mortal being? Have compassion therefore indeed, O supreme lord, and in thy descended portions protect the universe.

This whole world, from Brahmā to a tree, thou art. Wherefore dost thou, who art one with the supreme, beguile us? Blinded by delusion, I thought thee my son and for thee, who art beyond all fear, I dreaded the anger of Kansa, and therefore did I take thee in my terror to Gokula, where thou hast grown up but I no longer claim thee as mine own.
karmāṇi rudramarudaśviśatakratūnāṃ sādhyāni yasya na bhavanti nirīkṣitāni / tvaṃ viṣṇurīśa jagatāmupakārahetoḥ prāptosi naḥ parigato vigato hi mohaḥ //	Thou, Viṣṇu, the sovereign lord of all, whose actions Rudra, the Maruts, the Aśvins, Indra, and the gods, cannot equal, although they behold them thou who hast come amongst us for the benefit of the world, art recognised, and delusion is no more.”

uvāca cāṃba he tāta cirādutkaṇṭhitena me / bhavantau kaṃsabhītena dṛṣṭau saṃkarṣaṇena ca //	He said to them, “Mother venerable father you have both been long observed by Saṅkarṣaṇa and myself with sorrow, and in fear of Kansa.
kurvatāṃ yāti yaḥ kālo mātāpitrorapūjanam / tatkhaṇḍamāyuṣo vyarthamasādhūnāṃ hi jāyate //	He whose time passes not in respect to his father and mother, is a vile being, who descends in vain from virtuous parents.
gurudevadvijātīnāṃ mātāpitroś ca pūjanam / kurvatāṃ saphalaḥ kālo dehināṃ tāta jāyate //	The lives of those produce good fruit, who reverence their parents, their spiritual guides, the Brahmans, and the gods.

kaṃsapatnyastataḥ kaṃsaṃ parivārya hataṃ bhuvi / vilepurmātaraścāsya duḥkhaśokapariplutāḥ //	The wives of Kansa, and those of his father, then surrounded the body of the king, lying on the ground, and bewailed his fate in deep affliction.

In the course of sixtyfour days they had gone through the elements of military science, with the treatises on the use of arms, and directions for the mystic incantations, which secure the aid of supernatural weapons.
sāṃdīpanirasaṃbhāvyaṃ tayoḥ karmātimānuṣam / vicintya tau tadā mene prāptau candradivākarau //	Sāndīpani, astonished at such proficiency, and knowing that it exceeded human faculties, imagined that the sun and moon had become his scholars.

sāma copapradānaṃ ca tathā bhedaṃ ca darśayan / karoti daṇḍapātaṃ ca kvacideva palāyanam //	He had recourse to the four devices of policy, or negotiation, presents, sowing dissension, and chastisement and sometimes even betook himself to flight.
manuṣyadehināṃ ceṣṭāmityevamanuvartate / līlā jagatpatestasya cchandataḥ parivartate //	Thus imitating the conduct of human beings, the lord of the world pursued at will his sports. Birth of Kālayavana he advances against Mathurā.

The Yavana king having placed his son, whose breast was as hard as the point of the thunderbolt, upon the throne, retired to the woods.

dūtaṃ ca preṣayāmāsa kṛṣṇāya sumahātmane / tyaktvā cakrādikaṃ cihnaṃ madīyaṃ nāma cātmanaḥ // vāsudevātmakaṃ mūḍha tyaktvā sarvamaśeṣataḥ / ātmano jīvitārthāya tato me praṇati vraja // ityuktaḥsaṃprahasyainaṃ dūtaṃ prāhajanārdanaḥ / nijacihnamahaṃ cakraṃ samutsṛkṣye tvayīti vai // vācyaś ca paiṇḍrako gatvā tvayā dūta vaco mama / jñātas tvadvākyasadbhāvo yatkāryaṃ tadvidhīyatām //	Losing all recollection of his real character, he assumed the emblems of Viṣṇu, and sent an ambassador to the magnanimous Kṛṣṇa with this message “Relinquish, thou foolish fellow, the discus lay aside all my insignia, my name, and the character of Vāsudeva and come and do me homage and I will vouchsafe thee means of subsistence.” At which Janārddana laughed, and replied, “Go, messenger, back to Pauṇḍraka, and say to him from me, ‘I will dispatch to thee my emblem the discus without fail.
gṛhītacihnaveṣohamāgamiṣyāmi te puram / utsrakṣyāmi ca taccakraṃ nijacihnamasaṃśayam //	Thou wilt rightly apprehend my meaning, and consider what is to be done for I shall come to thy city, bringing the discus with me, and shall undoubtedly consign it to thee.

tatastu keśavodyogaṃ śrutvā kāśīpatistadā / sarvasainyaparivāraḥ pārṣṇigrāha upāyayau // tato balena mahatā kāśīrājabalena ca / paiṇḍrako vāsudevo 'sau keśavābhimukho yayau //	When the king of Kāśī heard of the preparations of Keśava, he sent his army to the aid of Pauṇḍraka, himself bringing up the rear and with the force of the king of Kāśī, and his own troops, Pauṇḍraka, the false Vāsudeva, marched to meet Kṛṣṇa.
taṃ dadarśa harirdūrādudārasyandane sthitam / cakrahastaṃ gadāśārṅgabāhuṃ pāṇigatāṃbujam // sragdharaṃ pītavasanaṃ suparmaracitadhvajam / vakṣasthale kṛtaṃ cāsya śrīvatsaṃ dadṛśe hariḥ //	Hari beheld him afar off, standing in his car, holding a discus, a club, a mace, a scimitar, and a lotus, in his hands ornamented with a garland of flowers bearing a bow and having his standard made of gold he had also the Srivatsa mark delineated on his breast he was dressed in yellow garments, and decorated with earrings and a tiara.

Showering upon the enemy the shafts from his Śāraṅga bow, and hurling at them his mace and discus, he quickly destroyed both the army of Pauṇḍraka and that of the king of Kāśī.
kāśīrājabalaṃ caivaṃ kṣayaṃ nītvā janārdanaḥ / uvāca paiṇḍrakaṃ mūḍhamātmacihnopalakṣitam //	He then said to the former, who was foolishly wearing his emblems, “Pauṇḍraka, you desired me by your envoy to resign to you all my insignia.
śrībhagavānuvāca	I now deliver them to you.
paiṇḍrakoktaṃ tvayā yattudūtavaktreṇa māṃ prati / samutsṛjeti cihnāni tatte saṃpādayāmyaham // cakrametatsamutsṛṣṭaṃ gadeyaṃ te visarjitā / garutmāneṣa cotsṛṣṭaḥsamārohatu te dhvajam //	Here is my discus here I give up my mace and here is Garuḍa, let him mount upon thy standard.” Thus speaking, he let fly the discus and the mace, by which Pauṇḍraka was cut to pieces, and cast on the ground whilst the Garuḍa on his banner was demolished by the Garuḍa of Viṣṇu.
tato hāhākṛte loke kāśīpuryadhipo balī / yuyudhe vāsudevena mitrasyāpacitau sthitaḥ // tataḥ śārṅgadhanurmuktaiś chittvā tasya śiraḥ śaraiḥ / kāśīpuryāṃ sa cikṣepa kurvaṃllokasya vismayam //	The people, beholding this sight, exclaimed, “Alas! alas!” but the valiant king of Kāśī, adhering to the imposture of his friend, continued the conflict, till Śauri decapitated him with his arrows, shooting his head into the city of Kāśī, to the marvel of all the inhabitants.
hatvā ta pauḍrakaṃ śauri kāśīrājaṃ ca sānugam / punardvāravatīṃ prāpto reme svargagato yatā //	Having thus slain Pauṇḍraka and the king of Kāśī, with all their followers, Śauri returned to Dvārakā, where he lived in the enjoyment of heavenly delights.
tacchiraḥ patitaṃ tatradṛṣṭvā kāśīpateḥ pure / janaḥ kimetadityāha cchinnaṃ keneti vismitaḥ //	When the inhabitants of Kāśī saw the head of their king shot into their city, they were much astonished, and wondered how it could have happened, and by whom the deed could have been done.

tāmavekṣya janastrāsādvicalallocano mune / yayau śaraṇyaṃ jagatāṃ śaraṇaṃ madhusūdanam //	Angrily she called upon Kṛṣṇa, and departed to Dvārakā where the people, beholding her, were struck with dismay, and fled for protection to Madhusūdana, the refuge of all worlds.
kāśīrājasuteneyamārādhya vṛṣabhadhvajam / utpāditā mahākṛtyetyavagamyātha cakriṇā // jahikṛtyāmimāmugrāṃ vahnijvālājaṭālakām / cakramutsṛṣṭamakṣeṣu krīḍāsaktena līlayā // tadagnimālājaṭilajvālodgārātibhīṣaṇām / kṛtyāmanujagāmāśu viṣṇucakraṃ sudarśanam //	The wielder of the discus knowing that the fiend had been produced by the son of the king of Kāśī, through his adoration of the deity whose emblem is a bull, and being engaged in sportive amusements, and playing at dice, said to the discus, “Kill this fierce creature, whose tresses are of plaited flame.” Accordingly Sudarśana, the discus of Viṣṇu, immediately attacked the fiend, fearfully enwreathed with fire, and wearing tresses of plaited flame.
cakrapratāpanirdagdhā kṛtyā māheśvarī tadā / nanāśa veginī vegāttadapyanujagāma tām // kṛtyā vārāṇasīmeva praviveśa tvarānvitā / viṣṇucakrapratihataprabhāvā munisattama //	Terrified at the might of Sudarśana, the creation of Maheśvara awaited not his attack, but fled with speed, pursued by him with equal velocity, until she reached Varānāśī, repelled by the superior might of the discus of Viṣṇu.
tataḥ kāśībalaṃ bhūri pramathānāṃ tathā balam / samastaśastrāstrayutaṃ cakrasyābhimukhaṃ yayau // śastrāstramokṣacaturaṃ dagdhvā tadbalamojasā / kṛtyā garbhamaśeṣāṃ tāṃ tadā vārāṇasīṃpurīm // sabhūbhṛdbhṛtyapaurāṃ tu sāśvamātaṅgamānavām / aśeṣagoṣṭhakośāṃ tāṃ durnirikṣyāṃ surair api //	The army of Kāśī, and the host of the demigods attendant upon Śiva, armed with all kinds of weapons, then sallied out to oppose the discus but, skilled in the use of arms, he consumed the whole of the forces by his radiance, and then set fire to the city, in which the magic power of Śiva had concealed herself. Thus was Varānāśī burnt, with all its princes and their followers, its inhabitants, elephants, horses, and men, treasures and granaries, houses, palaces, and markets.
jvālāpariṣkṛtāśeṣagṛhaprākāracatvarām / dadāha taddhareścakraṃ sakalāmeva tāṃ purīm //	The whole of a city, that was inaccessible to the gods, was thus wrapped in flames by the discus of Hari, and was totally destroyed.
akṣīṇāmarṣamatyugraṃ sādhyasādhanasaspṛham / taccakraṃ prasphuraddīpti viṣṇorabhyāyayau karam //	The discus then, with unmitigated wrath, and blazing fiercely, and far from satisfied with the accomplishment of so easy a task, returned to the hand of Viṣṇu.
maitreya uvāca	The Kuru chiefs give up Śāmba and his wife.
bhūya evāhamicchāmi balabhadrasya dhīmataḥ / śrotuṃ parākramaṃ brahman tanmamākhyātumarhasi // yamunākarṣaṇādīni śrutāni bhagavanmayā / tatkathyatāṃ mahābhāga yadanyatkṛtavānbalaḥ //	I have a great desire to hear, excellent Brahman, some further account of the exploits of Balarāma. You have related to me his dragging the Yamunā, and other mighty deeds, but you can tell me, venerable sir, some other of his acts.
maitreya śruyatāṃ karma yadrāmeṇābhavatkṛtam / anante nāprameyena śeṣeṇa dharaṇīdhṛtā //	Attend, Maitreya, to the achievements performed by Rāma, who is the eternal, illimitable Śeṣa, the upholder of the earth.
suyodhanasya tanayāṃ svayaṃvarakṛtakṣaṇām / balādādattavānvīraḥ sāṃbo jāṃbavatīsutaḥ //	At the choice of a husband by the daughter of Duryodhana, the princess was carried off by the hero Śāmba, the son of Jāmbavatī.
tataḥ kruddhāmahāvīryāḥ karṇaduryodhanādayaḥ / bhīṣmadroṇādayaścainaṃ babandhuryudhi nirjitam //	Being pursued by Duryodhana, Karṇa, Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and other celebrated chiefs, who were incensed at his audacity, he was defeated, and taken prisoner.
tacchutvā yādavāḥsarve krodhaṃ duryodhanādiṣu / maitreya cakruḥ kṛṣṇaś ca tānnihantuṃ mahodyamam // tānnivārya balaḥ prāha madalolakalākṣaram / mokṣyanti te madvacanādyāsyāmyeko hi kauravān // śrīparāśara uvāca	When the Yādavas heard of the occurrence, their wrath was kindled against Duryodhana and his associates, and they prepared to take up arms against them but Baladeva, in accents interrupted by the effects of ebriety, forbade them, and said, “I will go alone to the sons of Kuru they will liberate Śāmba at my request.” Accordingly he went to the elephantstyled city Hastināpur, but took up his abode in a grove without the town, which he did not enter.
baladevastato dṛṣṭvā nagaraṃ nāgasāhvayam / bāhyopavanamadhye 'bhūnna viveśa ca tatpuram //	When Duryodhana and the rest heard that he had arrived there, they sent him a cow, a present of fruits and flowers, and water.

What Yādava shall give orders to the chiefs of the family of Kuru? If Ugrasena issues his mandates to the Kauravas, then we must take away the white umbrella that he has usurped, and which is fit only for kings.
tadgaccha bala mā vā tvaṃ sāṃbamanyāyaceṣṭitam / vimokṣyāmo na bhavataścograsenasya śāsanāt //	Depart therefore, Balarāma you are entitled to our respect but Śāmba has been guilty of improper conduct, and we will not liberate him either at Ugrasenas commands or yours.
praṇatiryā kṛtāsmākaṃ mānyānāṃ kukurāndhakaiḥ / na nāma sā kṛtā keyamājñā svāmini bhṛtyataḥ // garvamāropitā yūyaṃ samānāsanabhojanaiḥ / ko doṣo bhavatāṃ nītiryatprītyā nāvalokitā // asmābhir argho bhavato yoyaṃ bala niveditaḥ / premṇaitannaitadasmākaṃ kulādyuṣmatkulocitam //	The homage that is due to us, their superiors, by the Kukkura and Andhaka tribes, may not be paid by them but who ever heard of a command issued by a servant to his master? Elevation to an equal seat has rendered you arrogant. We have committed a great mistake in neglecting, through our friendship for you, the policy that teaches the danger of treating the abject with deference. Our sending you today a respectful present was an intimation of personal regard, which it was neither fit for our race to have proffered, nor for yours to have expected.”
ityuktvā kuravaḥ sāṃbaṃ muñcāmo na hareḥsutam / kṛtaitaniścayastūrṇaṃ viviśurgajasāhvayam //	Having thus spoken, the Kuru chiefs, unanimously refusing to set the son of Hari at large, immediately returned into the city.

uvāca cātitāmrākṣo bhṛkuṭīkuṭilānanaḥ // aha madāvalepoyamasārāṇāṃ durātmanām / kauravāṇāṃ mahīpatvamasmākaṃ kila kālajam / ugrasenasya yenājñāṃ manyante 'dyapi laṅghanam //	His eyes reddened with rage, and his brow was curved with frowns, as he exclaimed, “What arrogance is this, in such vile and pithless creatures! The sovereignty of the Kauravas, as well as our own, is the work of fate, whose decree it also is that they now disrespect or disobey the commands of Ugrasena.
ugrasenaḥ samadhyāste sudhārmā na śacīpatiḥ / dhiṅmānuṣaśatocchiṣṭe tuṣṭireṣāṃ nṛpāsane //	Indra may of right give his orders to the gods and Ugrasena exercises equal authority with the lord of Śacī.

Is not he the sovereign of the earth, the wives of whose servants adorn themselves with the blossoms of the Pārijāta tree? Ugrasena shall be the undisputed king of kings for I will not return to his capital until I have rid the world wholly of the sons of Kuru.
karṇaṃ duryodhanaṃ droṇamadya bhīṣmaṃ sabāhlikam / duḥśasanādīnbhūriṃ ca bhūriśravasameva ca // somadattaṃ śalaṃ caiva bhīmārjunayudhiṣṭhirān / yamau ca kauravāṃścānyānhatvā sāśvarathadvipān //	I will destroy Karṇa, Duryodhana, Droṇa, Bhīṣma, Bāhlīka, Duhsāśana, Bhūrisravas, Somadatta, Śalya, Bhīma, Arjuna, Yudhiṣṭhira, the twins, and all the other vile descendants of Kuru, with their horses, elephants, and chariots.
vīramādāya taṃ sāṃbaṃ sapatnīkaṃ tataḥ purīm / dvārakāmugrasenādīngatvā drakṣyāmi bāndhavān //	I will rescue the hero Śāmba from captivity, and carry him, along with his wife, to Dvārakā, where I shall again behold Ugrasena and the rest of my kin.
atha vā kauravāvāsaṃ samastaiḥ kurubhiḥ saha / bhāgīrathyāṃ kṣipāmyāśu nagaraṃ nāgasāhvayam // śrīparāśara uvāca	Or, authorized by the king of the gods to remove the burdens of the earth, I will take this capital of the Kauravas, with all the sons of Kuru, and cast the city of the elephant into the Bhāgīrathī."
ityuktvā madaraktākṣaḥ karṣaṇādhomukhaṃ halam / prākāravapradurgasya cakarṣa musalāyudhaḥ //	So saying, the wielder of the club, Baladeva, his eyes red with rage, plunged the blade of his ploughshare downwards, beneath the ramparts of the city, and drew them towards him.
āghūrṇitaṃ tatsahasā tato vai hāstinaṃ puram / dṛṣṭvā saṃkṣubdhahṛdayāścukṣubhuḥsarvakauravāḥ // rāmarāma mahābāho kṣamyatāṃ kṣamyatāṃ tvayā / upasaṃhriyatāṃ kopaḥ prasīda musalāyudha //	When the Kauravas beheld Hastināpura tottering, they were much alarmed, and called loudly on Rāma, saying, “Rāma, Rāma! hold, hold! suppress your wrath! have mercy upon us! Here is Śāmba, and his wife also, delivered up to thee.
tato niryātayāmāsuḥsāṃbaṃ patnīsamanvitam / niṣkramya svapurāttūrṇaṃ kauravā munipuṅgava // bhīṣmadroṇakṛpādīnāṃ praṇamya vadatāṃ priyam / kṣāntameva mayetyāha balo balavatāṃ varaḥ //	Forgive our sins, committed in ignorance of thy wondrous power.” Accordingly, issuing hurriedly from the city, the Kauravas delivered Śāmba and his bride to the mighty Balarāma, who, bowing to Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and Kripa, who addressed him in conciliatory language, said, “I am satisfied ” and so desisted.
adyāpyāghūrṇitākāraṃ lakṣyate tatpuraṃ dvija / eṣa prabhāvo rāmasya balaśauryopalakṣaṇaḥ //	The city bears the marks of the shock it received, even to the present day—such was the might of Rāma—proving both his strength and prowess.
tatastu kauravāḥsāṃbaṃ saṃpūjya bali nā saha / preṣayāmāsurudvāhadhanabhāryāsamanvitam //	The Kauravas then offering homage to Śāmba and to Bala, dismissed the former with his wife and a bridal portion.

kāmarūpī mahārūpī kṛtvā sasyānyaśeṣataḥ / luṭhanbhramaṇasaṃmardaiḥ saṃcūrmayati vānaraḥ //	Dvivida also, who could assume what shape he would, enlarged his bulk to an immense size, and rolling and tumbling and trampling amidst the corn fields, he crushed and spoiled the harvests.
tena viprakṛtaṃ sarvaṃ jagadetaddurātmanā / niḥsvādhyāyavaṣaṭkāraṃ maitreyāsītsuduḥkhitam //	The whole world, disordered by this iniquitous monkey, was deprived of sacred study and religious rites, and was greatly afflicted.

tataḥ kopaparītātmā bhartsayāmāsa taṃ halī / tathāpi tamavajñāya cakrekilakiladhvanim // tataḥ smayitvā sa balo jagrāha musalaṃ ruṣā / so 'pi śailaśilāṃ bhīmāṃ jagrāha plavagottamaḥ //	Balarāma, becoming angry at this, threatened the monkey but the latter disregarded his menaces, and made a chattering noise on which Bala, starting up, seized his club in wrath and the monkey laid hold of a large rock, which he burled at the hero.
cikṣepa sa ca tāṃ kṣiptāṃ musalena sahasradhā / vibheda yādavaśreṣṭhaḥsā papāta mahītale //	Bala casting his club at it, as it neared him, broke it into a thousand fragments, which, together with the club, fell upon the ground.

Bala replied with a blow of his fist upon the forehead of Dvivida, which felled him, vomiting blood, and lifeless, to the earth.
patatā taccharīreṇa gireḥ śṛgamaśīryata / maitreya śatadhā vajrivajremeva vidāritam //	The crest of the mountain on which he fell was splintered into a hundred pieces by the weight of his body, as if the thunderer had shivered it with his thunderbolt.

IN this manner did Kṛṣṇa, assisted by Baladeva, destroy demons and iniquitous monarchs, for the good of the earth and along with Phālguna also did he relieve earth of her load, by the death of innumerable hosts. Having thus lightened the burdens of the earth, and slain many unrighteous princes, he exterminated, by the pretext of an imprecation denounced by Brahmans, his own Yādava race.

niḥśrīkatā na me citraṃ yajjīvāmi tadadbhutam / nīcāvamānapaṅkāṅkī nirlajjosmi pitāmaha //	That I am shorn of my lustre I do not marvel it is wonderful that I live. Surely, grandsire, I alone am so shameless as to survive the stain of indignity inflicted by the vile.”
vyāsa uvāca alaṃ te vrīḍayā pārtha na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi / avehi sarvabhūteṣu kālasya gatirīdṛśī //	Vyāsa replied to Arjuna, and said, “Think no more, my son, of your disgrace it does not become you to grieve. Know that time subjects all beings to similar vicissitude.
kālo bhavāya bhūtānāmabhavāya ca pāṇḍava / kālamūlam idaṃ jñātvā bhava sthairyaparo 'rjuna //	Time effects the production and dissolution of all creatures. All that exists is founded on time. Know this, Arjuna, and retain your fortitude.
nadyaḥ samudrā girayaḥsakalā ca vasuṃdharā / devā manuṣyāḥ paśavastaravaś ca sarīsṛpāḥ //	Rivers, seas, mountains, the whole earth, gods, men, animals, trees, insects, are all created, and all will be destroyed, by time.

ato gataḥsa bhagavānkatakṛtyo yathecchayā / sṛṣṭiṃ sarge karotyeṣa devadevaḥ sthitau sthitim / antentāya samarthoyaṃ sāṃprataṃ vai yathā gataḥ //	Therefore has the lord departed whither he pleased, his ends being all fulfilled. At the period of creation the god of gods creates in that of duration he preserves and at the end of all he is mighty to annihilate. Now all is done.

In like manner as through thy devotion to Viṣṇu these were overthrown by thee, so at last has thy defeat by miserable thieves been wrought by time.

Who would have believed that peasants should triumph over thee? Be assured, son of Pritha, that it is but the sport of the universal Hari that the Kauravas have been destroyed by thee, and that thou hast been defeated by herdsmen.
gṛhītā dasyubhir yāś ca bhavāñchocati tāḥstriyaḥ / etasyāhaṃ yathāvṛttaṃ kathayāmi tavārjuna //	With respect to the women whom thou lamentest, and who have been carried off by the thieves, hear from me an ancient story, which will explain why this has happened.
aṣṭāvakaḥ purā vipro jalavāsarato 'bhavat / bahūnvarṣagaṇānpārtha gṛṇanbrahma sanātanam //	”In former times a Brahman, named Aṣṭāvakra, was pursuing his religious penances, standing in water, and meditating on the eternal spirit, for many years.

ākaṇṭhamagnaṃ salile jaṭābhāravahaṃ munim / vinayāvanatāścainaṃ praṇemustotratatparāḥ //	They bowed down before him, and eulogized him, as he was immersed up to his throat in water, his hair twisted in a braid.
yathāyathā prasanno 'sau tuṣṭuvustaṃ tathātathā / sarvāstāḥ kauravaśreṣṭha taṃ variṣṭhaṃ dvijanmanām //	So they sang in honour of him whatever they thought would be most agreeable to that most eminent of Brahmans.

taṃ dṛṣṭvā gūhamānānāṃ yāsāṃ hāsaḥ sphuṭo 'bhavat / tāḥ śaśāpa muniḥ kopamavāpya kurunandana //	When the nymphs beheld him coming out of the water, and saw that he was very ugly, and crooked in eight places, they could not restrain their merriment, but laughed aloud.

All this destruction has been effected by the lord of all and your end is also nigh at hand, since he has withdrawn from you strength, splendour, valour, and preeminence.
jātasya niyato mṛtyuḥ patanaṃ ca tathonnateḥ / viprayogāvamānastu saṃyogaḥ saṃcaye kṣayaḥ //	Death is the doom of every one who is born fall is the end of exaltation union terminates in separation and growth tends but to decay.
vijñāya na budhāḥ śokaṃ na harṣamupayānti ye / teṣāmevetare ceṣṭāṃ śikṣantaḥsaṃti tādṛśāḥ //	Knowing all this, wise men are susceptible of neither grief nor joy and those who learn their ways are even as they are equally free from pleasure or pain.

Go now, and say from me to Yudhiṣṭhira, that he tomorrow, with his brethren, tread the path of heroes."
ityuktobhyetya pārthābhyāṃ yamābhyāṃ ca sahārjunaḥ / dṛṣṭaṃ caivānubhūtaṃ ca sarvamākhyātavāṃs tathā //	Thus instructed by Vyāsa, Arjuna went and related to the other sons of Pritha all that be had seen, had experienced, and had heard.

ityetattava maitreya vistareṇa mayoditam / jātasya yadyadorvaśe vāsudevasya ceṣṭitam //	I have thus narrated to you, Maitreya, in detail, the actions of Vāsudeva, when he was born in the race of Yadu.
maitreya uvāca vyākhyātā bhavatā sargavaṃśamanvantarasthitiḥ / vaṃśānucaritaṃ caiva vistareṇa mahāmune //	You have narrated to me, illustrious sage, the creation of the world, the genealogies of the patriarchs, the duration of the Manvantaras, and the dynasties of princes, in detail.
śrotumicchāmyahaṃ tvatto yathāvadupasaṃhṛtim / mahāpralayasaṃjñāṃ ca kalpānte ca mahāmune //	I am now desirous to hear from you an account of the dissolution of the world, the season of total destruction, and that which occurs at the expiration of a Kalpa.
maitreya śrūyatāṃ matto yathāvadupasaṃhṛtiḥ / kalpānte prākṛte caiva pralayo jāyate yathā //	Hear from me, Maitreya, exactly the circumstances of the end of all things, and the dissolution that occurs either at the expiration of a Kalpa, or that which takes place at the close of the life of Brahmā.
ahorātraṃ pitṝṇāṃ tu māso 'bdastridivaukasām / caturyugamahasre tu brahmaṇo vai dvijottama // kṛtaṃ tretā dvāparaṃ ca kaliśceti caturyugam / divyair varṣasahasrais tu taddvādaśabhir ucyate //	A month of mortals is a day and night of the progenitors a year of mortals is a day and night of the gods. Twice a thousand aggregates of the four ages is a day and night of Brahmā. The four ages are the Krita, Treta, Dvāpara, and Kali comprehending together twelve thousand years of the gods.
caturyugāṇy aśeṣāṇi sadṛśāni svarūpataḥ / ādyaṃ kṛtayugaṃ muktvā maitreyāntyaṃ tathā kalim //	There are infinite successions of these four ages, of a similar description, the first of which is always called the Krita, and the last the Kali.
ādye kṛtayuge sargo brahmaṇā kriyate yathā / kriyate copasaṃhārastathāṃ'te ca kalau yuge //	In the first, the Krita, is that age which is created by Brahmā in the last, which is the Kali age, a dissolution of the world occurs.
kaleḥsvarūpaṃ bhagavanvistarādvaktumarhasi / dharmaś catuṣpād bhagavān yasmin viplavam ṛcchati //	Venerable sir, you are able to give me a description of the nature of the Kali age, in which fourfooted virtue suffers total extinction.
śrīparāśara uvāca kaleḥsvarūpaṃ maitreya yadbhavāñchrotu micchati / tannibodha samāsena vartate yanmahāmune //	Hear, Maitreya, an account of the nature of the Kali age, respecting which you have inquired, and which is now close at hand.
durbhikṣakarapīḍābhir atīvopadrutā janāḥ / godhūmānnayavānnāḍhyāndeśānyāsyanti duḥkhitāḥ //	Oppressed by famine and taxation, men will desert their native lands, and go to those countries which are fit for coarser grains.
vedamārge pralīne ca pāṣaṇḍāḍhye tato jane / adharmavṛddhyā lokānāmalpamāyurbhaviṣyati //	The path of the Vedas being obliterated, and men having deviated into heresy, iniquity will flourish, and the duration of life will therefore decrease.
aśāstravihitaṃ ghoraṃ tapyamāneṣu vai tapaḥ / nareṣu nṛpadoṣeṇa bālye mṛtyurbhaviṣyati //	In consequence of horrible penances not enjoined by scripture, and of the vices of the rulers, children will die in their infancy.
bhavitā yoṣitāṃ sūtiḥ pañcaṣaṭmaptavārṣikī / navāṣṭadaśavarṣāṇāṃ manuṣyāṇāṃ tathā kalau //	Women will bear children at the age of five, six, or seven years and men beget them when they are eight, nine, or ten.
palitodbhavaś ca bhavitā tathā dvādaśavārṣikaḥ / nātijīvati vai kaścitkalau varṣāṇi viṃśatiḥ //	A man will be grey when he is twelve and no one will exceed twenty years of life.

In proportion as heresy extends, so, Maitreya, shall the progress of the Kali age be estimated by the wise.
prāraṃbhāścāvasīdanti yadā dharmabhṛtāṃ nṛṇām / tadānumeyaṃ prādhānyaṃ kaler maitreya paṇḍitaiḥ // yadāyāda na yajñānāmīśvaraḥ puruṣottamaḥ / ijyate puruṣair yajñais tadā jñeyaṃ kaler balam // na prītirvedavādeṣu pāṣaṇḍeṣu yadā ratiḥ / kalervṛddhistadā prājñair anumeyā vicakṣaṇaiḥ //	In proportion as the number of the pious, who adhere to the lessons of the Vedas, diminishes—as the efforts of individuals who cultivate virtue relax—as the first of males becomes no longer the object of sacrifices—as respect for the teachers of the Vedas declines—and as regard is acknowledged for the disseminators of heresy—so may wise men note the augmented influence of the Kali age.
vyāsaścāha mahābuddhiryadatraiva hi vastuni / tacchrūyatāṃ mahābhāgā gadato mama tattvataḥ //	UPON this subject, Maitreya, you shall hear what the wise Vyāsa has related, as it is communicated truly by me.
kasminkāle 'lpako dharmo dadāni sumahatphalam / munīnāṃ puṇyavādo 'bhūtkaiś cāsau kriyate sukham //	It was once a matter of dispute amongst the sages, at what season the least moral merit obtained the greatest reward, and by whom it was most easily displayed.
saṃdehanirṇayārthāya vedavyāsaṃ mahāmunim / yayuste saṃśayaṃ praṣṭuṃ maitreya munipuṅgavāḥ //	In order to terminate the discussion, they went to Veda Vyāsa to remove their doubts.

magno 'tha jāhnavītoyādutthāyāha suto mama / śudraḥsādhuḥ kaliḥsādhurityevaṃ śṛṇvatāṃ vacaḥ / teṣāṃ munīnāṃ bhūyaś ca mamajja sa nadījale // sādhusādhviti cotthāya śūdra dhanyosi cābravīt // nimagnaś ca samutthāya punaḥ prāha mahāmuniḥ / yoṣitaḥ sādhu dhanyāstāstābyo dhanyatarostikaḥ // tataḥ snātvā yathānyāyamācāntaṃ ca kṛtakriyam / upatasthurmahābhāgaṃ munayaste sutaṃ mama //	As my son plunged down into the water, and again rose up from it, the Munis heard him exclaim, “Excellent, excellent, is the Kali age!” Again he dived, and again rising, said in their hearing, “Well done, well done Śūdra thou art happy!” Again he sank down, and as he once more emerged they heard him say, “Well done, well done, women they are happy! who are more fortunate than they?” After this, my son finished his bathing, and the sages met him as he approached to welcome them.
kṛtasaṃvandanāṃścāha kṛtāsanaparigrahān / kimartha māgatā yūyamiti satyavatīsutaḥ // śrīparāśara uvāca tamūcuḥsaṃśayaṃ praṣṭaṃ bhavantaṃ vayamāgatāḥ / alaṃ tenāstu tāvannaḥ kathyatāmaparaṃ tvayā //	After he had given them seats, and they had proffered their respects, the son of Satyavatī said to them, “On what account have you come to me?” They replied, “We came to you to consult you on a subject on which we entertain some doubt but that may be at present suspended explain to us something else.
kaliḥsādhviti yatproktaṃ śūdraḥ sādhviti yoṣitaḥ / yadāha bhagavāntsādhu dhanyāśceti punaḥ punāḥ //	We heard you say, ‘Excellent is the Kali age! Well done, Śūdra! Well done, women!’ Now we are desirous to know why this was said, why you called them repeatedly, happy.
tat sarvaṃ śrotum icchāmo na ced guhyaṃ mahāmune / tatkathyatāṃ tato hṛtsthaṃ pṛcchāmastvāṃ prayojanam //	Tell us the meaning of it, if it be not a mystery. We will then propose to you the question that occupies our thoughts.”

dharmotkarṣamatīvātra prāpnoti puruṣaḥ kalau / alpāyāsena dharmajñāstena tuṣṭosmyahaṃ kaleḥ //	In the Kali age a man displays the most exalted virtue by very little exertion therefore, pious sages, who know what virtue is, I was pleased with the Kali age.
vratacaryāparair grāhyā vedāḥ pūrvaṃ dvijātibhiḥ / tataḥsa dharmasaṃprāptair yaṣṭavyaṃ vidhivad dhanaiḥ //	Formerly the Vedas were to be acquired by the twiceborn through the diligent observance of selfdenial and it was their duty to celebrate sacrifices conformably to the ritual.
vṛthā kathā vṛthā bhojyaṃ vṛthejyā ca dvijanmanām / patanāya tato bhāvyaṃ tais tu saṃyamibhiḥ sadā // asamyakkaraṇe doṣasteṣāṃ sarveṣu vastuṣu / bhojyapeyādikaṃ caiṣāṃ necchāprāptikaraṃ dvijāḥ //	Then idle prayers, idle feasts, and fruitless ceremonies, were practised but to mislead the twiceborn for although observed by them devoutly, yet, in consequence of some irregularity in their celebration, sin was iñcurred in all their works, and what they ate, or what they drank, did not effect the fulfilment of their desires.
pāratantryaṃ samasteṣu teṣāṃ kāryeṣu vai yataḥ / jayanti te nijāṃllokānkleśena mahatādvijāḥ // dvijaśuśrūṣayaivaiṣa pākayajñādhikāravān / nijāñjayati vai lokāñchūdro dhanyatarastataḥ // bhakṣyābhakṣyeṣu nāsyāsti peyāpeyeṣu vai yataḥ / niyamo muniśārdūlāstenāsau sādhvitīritaḥ //	In all their objects the twiceborn enjoyed no independence, and they attained their respective spheres only with exceeding pain. The Śūdra, on the contrary, more fortunate than they, reaches his assigned station by rendering them service, and performing merely the sacrifice of preparing food, in which no rules determine what may or may not be eaten, what may or may not be drunk. Therefore, most excellent sages, is the Śūdra fortunate.
svadharmasyāvirodhena narair labdhaṃ dhanaṃ sadā / pratipādanīyaṃ pātreṣu yaṣṭavyaṃ ca yathāvidhi //	”Riches are accumulated by men in modes not incompatible with their peculiar duties, and they are then to be bestowed upon the worthy, and expended in constant sacrifice.
tasyārjane mahākleśaḥ pālane ca dvijottamāḥ / tathāsadviniyogena vijñātaṃ gahanaṃ nṛṇām //	There is great trouble in their acquisition great care in their preservation great distress from the want of them and great grief for their loss.
evamanyais tathā kleśaiḥ puruṣā dvijasattamāḥ / nijāñjayanti vai lokānprājāpatyādikānkramāt //	Thus, eminent Brahmans, through these and other sources of anxiety, men attain their allotted spheres of Prajāpati and the rest only by exceeding labour and suffering.
yoṣicchuśrūṣaṇādbhartuḥ karmaṇā manasā girā / taddhitā śubhamāpnoti tatsālokyaṃ yato dvijāḥ // nātikleśena mahatā tāneva puruṣo yathā / tṛtīyaṃ vyāhṛtaṃ tena mayā sādhviti yoṣitaḥ //	This is not the case with women a woman has only to honour her husband, in act, thought, and speech, to reach the same region to which he is elevated and she thus accomplishes her object without any great exertion. This was the purport of my exclamation, ‘Well done!’ the third time.
etadvaḥ kathitaṃ viprāyannimittamihāgataḥ / tatpṛcchataḥ yathākāmaṃ sava bakṣyāmi vaḥ sphuṭam // ṛṣayaste tataḥ procuryatpraṣṭavyaṃ mahāmune / asminneva ca tatpraśne yathāvatkathitaṃ tvayā //	I have thus related to you what you asked. Now demand the question you came to put to me, in any way you please, and I will make you a distinct reply."

tatastritayamapyetanmama dhanyataraṃ matam / dharmasaṃpādane kleśo dvijātīnāṃ kṛtādiṣu //	Therefore, Brahmans, did I thrice express my admiration of their happiness for in the Krita and other ages great were the toils of the regenerate to perform their duty.
bhavadbhir yad abhipretaṃ tadetatkathitaṃ mayā / apṛṣṭenāpi dharmajñāḥ kimanyatkriyatāṃ dvijāḥ //	I waited not for your inquiry, but replied at once to the question you purposed to ask. Now, ye who know what virtue is, what else do you wish me to tell you?”
tataḥsaṃpūjya te vyāsaṃ praśaśaṃsuḥ punaḥ punaḥ / yathāgatandvijā jagmurvyāsoktikṛtaniścayāḥ //	The Munis then saluted and praised Vyāsa, and, being freed by him from uncertainty, departed as they came.
bhavato 'pi mahābhāga rahasyaṃ kathitaṃ mayā / atyantaduṣṭasya kalerayameko mahānmuṇaḥ //	To you also, excellent Maitreya, have I imparted this secret, this one great virtue of the otherwise vicious Kali age.
yaccāhaṃ bhavatā pṛṣṭo jagatāmupasaṃhṛtim / prākṛtāmantarālāṃ ca tāmapyeṣa vadāmi te //	The dissolution of the world, and the aggregation of the elements, I will now describe to you.
iti śrīviṣṇumāhapurāṇe ṣaṣṭhāṃśe dvitīyo 'dhyāyaḥ	Three different kinds of dissolution.
śrīparāśara uvāca	Duration of a Parārddha.
sarveṣāmeva bhūtānāṃ trividhaḥ pratisaṃcaraḥ / naimittikaḥ prākṛtikaḥ tathaivātyantiko layaḥ //	The dissolution that occurs at the end of a day of Brahmā. THE dissolution of existing beings is of three kinds, incidental, elemental, and absolute.
brāhmo naimittikasteṣāṃ kalpānte pratisaṃcaraḥ / ātyantikastu mokṣākhyaḥ prākṛto dviparārdhakaḥ //	The incidental is that which relates to Brahmā, and occurs at the end of a Kalpa the elemental is that which takes place after two Parārddhas the absolute is final liberation from existence.
parārdhasaṃkhyāṃ bhagavanmamācakṣva yayā tu saḥ / dviguṇīkṛtayā jñeyaḥ prākṛtaḥ pratisaṃcaraḥ // śrīparāśara uvāca	Tell me, excellent master, what is the enumeration of a Parārddha, the expiration of two of which is the period of elemental dissolution.
sthānātsthānaṃ daśaguṇamekasmādraṇyate dvija / tatoṣṭādaśame bhāge parārdhamabhidhīyate //	A Parārddha, Maitreya, is that number which occurs in the eighteenth place of figures, enumerated according to the rule of decimal notation.
parārdhadviguṇaṃ yattu prākṛtaḥsa layo dvija / tadāvyaktekhilaṃ vyaktaṃ svahetau layameti vai //	At the end of twice that period elemental dissolution occurs, when all the discrete products of nature are withdrawn into their indiscrete source.
nimeṣo mānuṣo yo 'sau mātrāmātrāpramāṇataḥ / taiḥ pañcadaśabhiḥ kāṣṭhā triṃśatkāṣṭha kalā smṛtā //	The shortest period of time is a Mātrā, which is equal to the twinkling of the human eye. Fifteen Mātrās make a Kāṣṭhā thirty Kāṣṭhās, one Kalā fifteen Kalās, one Nāḍikā.
nāḍikā tu pramāṇena sā kalā daśa pañca ca // unmānenāṃbhasaḥsā tu palānyardhatrayodaśa / māgadhena tu mānena jalaprasthastu sa smṛtaḥ / hemamāṣaiḥ kṛtacchidracaturbhiścāturaṅgulaiḥ //	A Nāḍikā is ascertained by a measure of water, with a vessel made of twelve Palas and a half of copper, in the bottom of which there is to be a hole made with a tube of gold, of the weight of four Māṣas, and four inches long. According to the Māgadha measure, the vessel should hold a Prastha or sixteen Palas of water.
nāḍikābhyāmatha dvābhyāṃ muhūrto dvijasattama / ahorātraṃ muhurtāstu triṃśanmāso dinais tathā //	Two of these Nāḍīs make one Muhūrtta thirty of which are one day and night.
māsair dvādaśabhir varṣamahorātraṃ tutaddivi / tribhir varṣaśatair varṣaṃ ṣaṣṭyā caivāsuradviṣām //	Thirty such periods form a month twelve months make a year, or a day and night of the gods and three hundred and sixty such days constitute a year of the celestials.
tais tu dvādaśasāhastraiś caturyugamudāhṛtam / caturyugasahasraṃ tu kathyate brahmaṇo dinam //	An aggregate of four ages contains twelve thousand divine years and a thousand periods of four ages complete a day of Brahmā.
sa kalpastatra manavaścaturdaśa mahāmune / tadante caiva maitreya brāhmo nemittiko layaḥ //	That period is also termed a Kalpa, during which fourteen Manus preside and at the end of it occurs the incidental or Brahmā dissolution.
tasya svarūpamatyugraṃ maitreya gadato mama / śṛṇuṣva prākṛtaṃ bhūyastava vakṣyāmyahaṃ layam //	The nature of this dissolution is very fearful hear me describe it, as well as that which takes place at the elemental dissolution, which I will also relate to you.
caturyugasahasrānte kṣīṇaprāye mahītale / anāvṛṣṭiratīvogrā jāyate śatavārṣikī // tato yānyalpasārāṇi tāni sattvānyaśeṣataḥ / kṣayaṃ yānti muniśreṣṭha pārthivānyanupījanāt //	At the end of a thousand periods of four ages the earth is for the most part exhausted. A total dearth then ensues, which lasts a hundred years and, in consequence of the failure of food, all beings become languid and exanimate, and at last entirely perish.
tataḥ sabhagavānviṣṇu rudrarūpadharo 'vyayaḥ / kṣayāya yatate kartumātmasthāḥsakalāḥ prajāḥ // tataḥ sa bhagavān viṣṇur bhānoḥ saptasu raśmiṣu / sthitaḥ pibatyaśeṣāṇi jalāni munisaptama //	The eternal Viṣṇu then assumes the character of Rudra, the destroyer, and descends to reunite all his creatures with himself. He enters into the seven rays of the sun, drinks up all the waters of the globe, and causes all moisture whatever, in living bodies or in the soil, to evaporate thus drying up the whole earth.
samudrānsāritaḥ śailanadīprasravaṇāni ca / pātāleṣu ca yattoyaṃ tatsarvaṃ nayati kṣayam //	The seas, the rivers, the mountain torrents, and springs, are all exhaled and so are all the waters of Pātāla, the regions below the earth.
tatastasyānubhāvena toyāhāropabṛṃhitāḥ / ta eva raśmayaḥsapta jāyante sapta bhāskarāḥ // adhaścordhvaṃ ca te dīptā stataḥsapta divākarāḥ / dahantyaśaṣaṃ trailokyaṃ sapātālatalaṃ dvija //	Thus fed, through his intervention, with abundant moisture, the seven solar rays dilate to seven suns, whose radiance glows above, below, and on every side, and sets the three worlds and Pātāla on fire.
dahyamānaṃ tu tair dīptais trailokyaṃ dvija bhāskaraiḥ / sādrinadyarṇavābhogaṃ nisnehamabhijāyate // tato nirdagdhavṛkṣāṃbutrailokyamākhitaṃ dvija / bhavatyeṣā ca vasudhā kūrmapṛṣṭhopamākṛtiḥ // tataḥ kālāgnirudro 'sau bhūtvā sarvaharo 'nalaḥ / śeṣāhiśvāsasaṃbhūtaḥ pātālāni dahatyadhaḥ //	The three worlds, consumed by these suns, become rugged and deformed throughout the whole extent of their mountains, rivers, and seas and the earth, bare of verdure, and destitute of moisture, alone remains, resembling in appearance the back of a tortoise. The destroyer of all things, Hari, in the form of Rudra, who is the flame of time, becomes the scorching breath of the serpent Śeṣa, and thereby reduces Pātāla to ashes.
pātālāni samastāni sa dagdhvā jvalano mahān / bhūmimabhyetya sakalaṃ babhasti vasudhātalam //	The great fire, when it has burnt all the divisions of Pātāla, proceeds to the earth, and consumes it also.
bhuvarlokaṃ tataḥsarvaṃ svarlokaṃ ca sudāruṇaḥ / jvālāmālāmahāvartastatraiva parivartate // aṃbarīṣamivābhāti trailokyamakhilaṃ tadā / jvālāvartaparivāramupakṣīṇacarācaram //	A vast whirlpool of eddying flame then spreads to the region of the atmosphere, and the sphere of the gods, and wraps them in ruin. The three spheres shew like a fryingpan amidst the surrounding flames, that prey upon all moveable or stationary things.
tatastāpaparītāstu lokadvayanivāsinaḥ / kṛtādhikārāgacchanti maharlokaṃ mahāmune //	The inhabitants of the two upper spheres, having discharged their functions, and being annoyed by the heat, remove to the sphere above, or Maharloka.
tasmādapi mahātāpataptā lokāttataḥ param / gañcchanti janalokaṃ te daśāvṛttyā paraiṣiṇaḥ // tato dagdhvā jagatsarvaṃ rudrarūpījanārdanaḥ / mukhaniśvāsajānmeghānkaroti munisattama // tato gajakulaprakhyāstaḍitvanto 'tinādinaḥ / uttiṣṭhanti tathā vyomnighorāḥsaṃvartakā ghanāḥ //	When that becomes heated, its tenants, who after the full period of their stay are desirous of ascending to higher regions, depart for the Janaloka. Janārddana, in the person of Rudra, having consumed the whole world, breathes forth heavy clouds and those called Samvartta, resembling vast elephants in bulk, overspread the sky, roaring, and darting lightnings.
kecinnīlotpalaśyāmāḥ kecitkumudasannibhāḥ / dhūmravarṇā ghanāḥ kecitkecitpītāḥ payo dharāḥ // kecidrāsabhavarṇābhā lākṣārasanibhās tathā / kecidvaiḍūryasaṃkāśā indranīlanibhāḥ kvacit // śaṅkhakundanibhāś cānye jātyaṃ jananibhāḥ pare / indragopanibhāḥ kecit tataḥ śakhinibhās tathā //	Some are as black as the blue lotus some are white as the waterlily some are dusky, like smoke and some are yellow some are of a dun colour, like that of an ass some like ashes sprinkled on the forehead some are deep blue, as the lapis lazuli some azure, like the sapphire some are white, as the conch or the jasmine and some are black, as collyrium some are of bright red, like the ladybird some are of the fierceness of red arsenic and some are like the wing of the painted jay.
kecitpuravarākārāḥ kecitparvatasannibhāḥ / kūṭāgāranibhāścānye kecitsthalanibā ghanāḥ //	Such are these massy clouds in hue in form some resemble towns, some mountains, some are like houses and hovels, and some are like columns.
mahārāvā mahākāyāḥ pūrayanti nabhaḥsthalam / varṣantaste mahāsārāstamagnimatibhairavam / śamayantyakhilaṃ vipra trailokyāntaradhiṣṭhitam // naṣṭe cāgnau ca satataṃ varṣamāṇā hyaharniśam / plāvayanti jagat sarvam aṃbhobir munisattama //	Mighty in size, and loud in thunder, they fill all space. Showering down torrents of water, these clouds quench the dreadful fires which involve the three worlds, and then they rain uninterruptedly for a hundred years, and deluge the whole world.
dhārābhir atimātrābhiḥ plāvayitvākhilāṃ bhuvam / bhuvarlokaṃ tathevordhū plāvayanti hi te dvija //	Pouring down in drops as large as dice, these rains overspread the earth, and fill the middle region, and inundate heaven.
andhakārīkṛte loke naṣṭe sthāvarajaṅgame / varṣati te mahāmeghā varṣāṇāmadhikaṃ śatam //	The world is now enveloped in darkness, and all things, animate or inanimate, having perished, the clouds continue to pour down their waters for more than a hundred years.
saptarśisthānāmākramya sthiteṃbhasi mahāmune / ekārṇavaṃ bhavatyetattrailokyamakhilaṃ tataḥ //	WHEN the waters have reached the region of the seven Ṛṣis, and the whole of the three worlds is one ocean, they stop.
mukhaniśvāsajo viṣṇorvāyustāñjaladāṃstataḥ / nāśayanvāti maitreya varṣāṇāmaparaṃ śatam //	The breath of Viṣṇu becomes a strong wind, which blows for more than a hundred years, until all the clouds are dispersed.
sarvabhūtamayo 'cintyo bhagavānbhūtabhāvanaḥ / anādirādirviśvasya pītvā vāyumaśeṣataḥ // ekārṇave tatastasmiñcheṣaśayyāgataḥ prabhuḥ / brahmarūpadharaḥ śete bhagavānādikṛddhariḥ // janalokagataiḥ siddhaiḥ samakādyair abhiṣṭutaḥ / brahmalokagataiś caiva cintyamāno mumukṣubhiḥ // ātmamāyāmayīṃ divyāṃ yoganidrāṃ samāsthitaḥ / ātmānaṃ vāsudevākhyaṃ cintayanmadhusūdanaḥ //	The wind is then reabsorbed, and he of whom all things are made, the lord by whom all things exist, he who is inconceivable, without beginning of the universe, reposes, sleeping upon Śeṣa, in the midst of the deep. The creator, Hari, sleeps upon the ocean, in the form of Brahmā—glorified by Sanaka And the saints who had gone to the Janaloka, and contemplated by the holy inhabitants of Brahmaloka, anxious for final liberation—involved in mystic slumber, the celestial personification of his own illusions, and meditating on his own ineffable spirit, which is called Vāsudeva.
eṣa naimittiko nāma maitreyaḥ pratisaṃcaraḥ / nimittaṃ tatra yacchete brahmarūpadharo hariḥ //	This, Maitreya, is the dissolution termed incidental, because Hari, in the form of Brahmā, sleeps there, as its incidental cause.
yadā jāgarti sarvātmā sa tadā ceṣṭate jagat / nimīlatyetadakhilaṃ māyāśayyāṃ gate 'cyute //	When the universal spirit wakes, the world revives when he closes his eyes, all things fall upon the bed of mystic slumber.
padmayonerdinaṃ yattu caturyugasahasravat / ekārṇavīkṛte loke tāvatī rātririṣyate //	In like manner as a thousand great ages constitute a day of Brahmā, so his night consists of the same period during which the world is submerged by a vast ocean.
tataḥ prabuddho rātryante punaḥsṛṣṭiṃ karotyajaḥ / brahmasvarūpadhṛgviṣṇuryathā te kathitaṃ purā //	Awaking at the end of his night, the unborn, Viṣṇu, in the character of Brahmā, creates the universe anew, in the manner formerly related to you.
ityeṣa kalpasaṃhāro 'vāntarapralayo dvija / naimittikaste kathitaḥ prākṛtaḥ śṛṇvataḥ param //	I have thus described to you the intermediate dissolution of the world, occurring at the end of every Kalpa.
anāvṛṣṭyādisaṃparkāt kṛte saṃkṣālane mune / samasteṣveva lokeṣu pātāleṣvakhileṣu ca // mahadādervikārasya viśeṣāntasya saṃkṣaye / kṛṣṇecchākārite tasminpravṛtte pratisaṃcare //	When by dearth and fire all the worlds and Pātālas are withered up, and the modifications of Mahat and other products of nature are by the will of Kṛṣṇa destroyed, the progress of elemental dissolution is begun.
āpo grasaṃti vai pūrvaṃ bhūmergandhātmakaṃ guṇam / āttagandhā tato bhūmiḥ pralayatvāya kalpate //	Then, first, the waters swallow up the property of earth, which is the rudiment of smell and earth, deprived of its property, proceeds to destruction.
sarvamāpūrayantīdaṃ tiṣṭhanti vicaranti ca / salilenormimālena ālokāntātsamantataḥ //	The waters then being much augmented, roaring, and rushing along, fill up all space, whether agitated or still.
apāmapi guṇo yastu jyotiṣā pīyate tu saḥ / naśyantyāpastatastāś ca rasatanmātrasaṃkṣayāt // tataścāpo hṛtarasājyotiṣaṃ prāpnuvanti vai / agnāvasthe tu salile tejasā sarvato vṛte // sa cāgniḥ sarvato vyāpya cādatte tajjalaṃ tathā / sarvamāpūryatercirbhis tadā jagadidaṃ śanaiḥ //	When the universe is thus pervaded by the waves of the watery element, its rudimental flavour is licked up by the element of fire, and, in consequence of the destruction of their rudiments, the waters themselves are destroyed. Deprived of the essential rudiment of flavour, they become one with fire, and the universe is therefore entirely filled with flame, which drinks up the water on every side, and gradually overspreads the whole of the world.
arcirbhiḥ saṃvṛte tasmiṃstiryagūrdhvamadhastadā / jyotiṣo 'pi paraṃ rūpaṃ vāyuratti prabhākaram // pralīne ca tatastasminvāyubhūte 'khilātmani / pranaṣṭe rūpatanmātre hṛtarūpo vibhāvasuḥ // praśāmyati tadājyotirvāyurdedhūyate mahān / nirā loke tathā loke vāyvavasthe ca tejasi //	While space is enveloped in flame, above, below, and all around, the element of wind seizes upon the rudimental property, or form, which is the cause of light and that being withdrawn, all becomes of the nature of air. The rudiment of form being destroyed, and fire deprived of its rudiment, air extinguishes fire, and spreads resistlessly over space, which is deprived of light when fire merges into air.
tatastu mūlamāsādya vāyuḥsaṃbhavamātmanaḥ / ūrdhvaṃ cādhaś ca tiryakca dodhavīti diśo daśa // vāyorapi guṇaṃ sparśamākāśo grasate tataḥ / praśāmyati tato vāyuḥ khaṃ tu tiṣṭhatyanāvṛtam // arūparasamasparśamagandhaṃ na ca mūrtimat / sarvamāpūrayaccaiva sumahāttatprakāśate //	Air then, accompanied by sound, which is the source of ether, extends every where throughout the ten regions of space, until ether seizes upon contact, its rudimental property by the loss of which, air is destroyed, and ether remains unmodified devoid of form, flavour, touch, and smell, it exists unembodied and vast, and pervades the whole of space. Ether, whose characteristic property and rudiment is sound, exists alone, occupying all the vacuity of space.
bhūtendriyeṣu yugapadbhūtādau saṃsthiteṣu vai / abimānātmako hyeṣa bhūtādistāmasaḥsmṛtaḥ //	But then the radical element egotism devours sound, and all the elements and faculties are at once merged into their original.
bhītādiṃ grasate cāpi mahānve buddhilakṣaṇaḥ // urvī mahaṃś ca jagataḥ pratintarbāhyatas tathā //	This primary element is consciousness, combined with the property of darkness, and is itself swallowed up by Mahat, whose characteristic property is intelligence and earth and Mahat are the inner and outer boundaries of the universe.
evaṃ sapta mahābuddhe kramātprakṛtayaḥsmṛtāḥ / pratyāhāre tu tāḥsarvāḥ praviśanti parasparam //	In this manner, as in the creation were the seven forms of nature Prakriti, reckoned from Mahat to earth, so, at the time of elemental dissolution, these seven successively reenter into each other.
yenedamāvṛtaṃ sarvamaṇḍamapsu pralīyate / saptadvīpasamudrāntaṃ saptalokaṃ saparvatam //	The egg of Brahmā is dissolved in the waters that surround it, with its seven zones, seven oceans, seven regions, and their mountains.
udakāvaraṇaṃ yattu jyotiṣā pīyate tu tam / jyotirvāyau layaṃ yāti yātyākāśe samīramaḥ // ākāśaṃ caiva bhūtādirgrasate taṃ tathā mahān / mahāntamebhiḥ sahitaṃ prakṛtirgrasate dvija // gumasāmyamanudriktamanyūnaṃ ca mahāmune / procyate prakatirhetuḥ pradhānaṅkāraṇaṃ param //	The investure of water is drunk up by fire the stratum of fire is absorbed by that of air air blends itself with ether the primary element of egotism devours the ether, and is itself taken up by intellect, which, along with all these, is seized upon by nature Prakriti. Equilibrium of the three properties, without excess or deficiency, is called nature Prakriti, origin Hetu, the chief principle Pradhaṇa, cause Kāraṇa, supreme Param.
ityeṣā prakṛtiḥsarvā vyaktāvyaktasvarūpiṇī / vyaktasvarūpamavyakte tasmānmaitreya līyate //	This Prakriti is essentially the same, whether discrete or indiscrete only that which is discrete is finally lost or absorbed in the indiscrete.
ekaḥ śuddho 'kṣaro nityaḥsarvavyāpī tathā pumān / so 'py aṃśaḥsarvabhūtasya maitreya paramātmanaḥ //	Spirit also, which is one, pure, imperishable, eternal, allpervading, is a portion of that supreme spirit which is all things.
na saṃti yatra sarveśe nāmajātyādikalpanāḥ / sattāmātratmake jñeye jñānātmanyātmanaḥ pare // tadbrahma paramaṃ dhāma paramātmā sa ceśvaraḥ / sa viṣṇuḥsarvamevedaṃ yato nāvartate yatiḥ //	That spirit which is other than embodied spirit, in which there are no attributes of name, species, or the like—which is one with all wisdom, and is to be understood as sole existence—that is Brahma, infinite glory, supreme spirit, supreme power, Viṣṇu, all that is from whence the perfect sage returns no more.
prakṛtiryā mayākhyātā vyaktāvyaktasvarūpiṇī / puruṣaścāpyubhāvetau liyate paramātmani //	Nature Prakriti, which I have described to you as being essentially both discrete and indiscrete, and spirit which is united with body, both resolve into supreme spirit.
paramātmā ca sarveṣāmādhāraḥ parameśvaraḥ / viṣṇunāmā sa vedeṣu vedānteṣu ca gīyate //	Supreme spirit is the upholder of all things, and the ruler of all things, and is glorified in the Vedas and in the Vedanta by the name of Viṣṇu.
pravṛttaṃ ca nivṛttaṃ ca dvividhaṅkarma vaidikam / tābhyāmubhābhyāṃ puruṣaiḥ sarvamūrtiḥsa ijyate //	Works, as enjoined by the Vedas, are of two kinds, active Pravritta and quiescent Nivritta by both of which the universal person is worshipped by mankind.
ṛgyajuḥsāmabhir mārgaiḥ pravṛtterijyate hyasau / yajñeśvaro yajñapumānpuruṣaiḥ puruṣottamaḥ //	He, the lord of sacrifice, the male of sacrifice, the most excellent male, is worshipped by men in the active mode by rites enjoined in the Rik, Yajur, and Sāma Vedas.
jñānātmā jñānayogena jñānamūrtiḥ sa cejyate / nivṛtte yogibhir mārge viṣṇurmuktiphalapradaḥ //	The soul of wisdom, the person of wisdom, Viṣṇu, the giver of emancipation, is worshipped by sages in the quiescent form, through meditative devotion.
hrasvadīrghaplutair yattu kiñcidvastvabhidhīyate / yacca vācāmaviṣayaṃ tatsarvaṃ viṣṇuravyayaḥ //	The exhaustless Viṣṇu is whatever thing that is designated by long, short, or prolated syllables, or that which is without a name.
vyaktaḥsa eva cāvyaktaḥsa eva puruṣottamaḥ / paramātmā ca viśvātmā viśvarūpadharohariḥ //	He is that which is discrete, and that which is indiscrete he is exhaustless spirit, supreme spirit, universal spirit, Hari, the wearer of universal forms.
vyaktāvyaktātmikā tasminprakṛtiḥsaṃpralīyate / puruṣaścāpi maitreya vyāpinyavyāhatātmani //	Nature, whether discrete or indiscrete, is absorbed into him, and detached spirit also merges into the alldiffusive and unobstructed spirit.
dviparārdhātmakaḥ kālaḥ kathito yo mayā tava / tadahastasya maitreya viṣṇorīśasya kathyate // vyakte ca prakṛtau līne prakṛtyāṃ puruṣe tathā / tatra sthite niśā cāsya tatpramāṇā mahāmune //	The period of two Parārddhas, as I have described it to you, Maitreya, is called a day of that potent Viṣṇu and whilst the products of nature are merged into their source, nature into spirit, and that into the supreme, that period is termed his night, and is of equal duration with his day.
naivāhastasya na niśā nityasya paramātmanaḥ / upacārastathāpyeṣa tasyeśasya dvijocyate //	But, in fact, to that eternal supreme spirit there is neither day nor night, and these distinctions are only figuratively applied to the almighty.
ityeṣa tava maitreya kathitaḥ prākṛto layaḥ / ātyantikamatho brahmannibodha pratisaṃcaram //	I have thus explained to you the nature of elemental dissolution, and will now expound to you which is final.
iti śrīviṣṇumahāpurāṇe ṣaṣṭhāṃśe caturtho 'dhyāyaḥ	The third kind of dissolution, or final liberation from existence. Evils of worldly life.
śrīparāśara uvāca	The nature of spirit or god.
ādhyātmikādi maitreya jñātvā tāpatrayaṃ budhaḥ / utpannajñānavairāgyaṃ prāpnotyātyantikaṃ layam //	THE wise man having investigated the three kinds of worldly pain, or mental and bodily affliction and the like, and having acquired true wisdom, and detachment from human objects, obtains final dissolution.
ādhyātmikopi dvividhaḥ śarīro mānasas tathā / śarīro bahubhir bhedair bhidyate śruyatāṃ ca saḥ //	The first of the three pains, or Ādhyātmika, is of two kinds, bodily and mental. Bodily pain is of many kinds, as you shall hear.
śirorogapratiśyāyajvaraśūlabhagandaraiḥ / gulmārśaḥ śvayayuśvāsacchardyādibhir anekadhā // tathākṣirogātīsārakuṣṭhāṅgāmayasaṃjñitaiḥ / bhidyate dehajastāpo mānasaṃ śrotumarhasi // kāmakrodhabhayadveṣalobhamohaviṣādajaḥ / śokāsūyāvamānerṣyāmātsaryādimayas tathā //	Affections of the head, catarrh, fever, cholic, fistula, spleen, hemorrhoids, intumescence, sickness, ophthalmia, dysentery, leprosy, and many other diseases, constitute bodily affliction. Mental sufferings are love, anger, fear, hate, covetousness, stupefaction, despair, sorrow, malice, disdain, jealousy, envy, and many other passions which are engendered in the mind.
mānaso 'pi dvijaśreṣṭha tāpo bhavati naikadhā / ityevamādibhir bhedais tāpo hyādhyātmikaḥ smṛtaḥ //	These and various other afflictions, mental or corporeal, are comprised, under the class of worldly sufferings, which is called Ādhyātmika natural and inseparable.
mṛgapakṣimanuṣyādyaiḥ piśācoragarākṣasaiḥ / sarīsṛpādyaiś ca nṛṇāṃ jāyate cādhibhautikaḥ // śītavā toṣṇavārṣābubaidyutādisamudbhavaḥ / tāpo dvijavaraśreṣṭhaiḥ kathyate cādhidaivikaḥ //	That pain to which, excellent Brahman, the term Ādhibhautika natural, but incidental is applied, is every kind of evil which is inflicted from without upon men by beasts, birds, men, goblins, snakes, fiends, or reptiles and the pain that is termed Ādhidaivika or superhuman is the work of cold, heat, wind, rain, lightning, and other atmospherical phenomena.
garbhajanmajarājñānamṛtyunārakajaṃ tathā / duḥkhaṃ sahasraśo bhedair bhidyate munisattama //	Affliction, Maitreya, is multiplied in thousands of shapes in the progress of conception, birth, decay, disease, death, and hell.
sukumāratanurgarbhe janturbahumalāvṛte / ulvasaṃveṣṭito bhugnapṛṣṭhagrīvāsthisaṃhatiḥ // atyamlakaṭutīkṣmoṣṇalavaṇair mātṛbhojanaiḥ / atyantatāpair atyarthaṃ vardhamānātivedanaḥ // prasāraṇākuñcanādau nāṅgānāṃ prabhurātmanaḥ / śakṛnmūtramahāpaṅkaśāyī sarvatra pīḍitaḥ // nirucchvāsaḥ sacaitanyaḥ smarañ janmaśatāny atha / āste garbhe 'tiduḥkhena nijakarmanibandhanaḥ //	The tender and subtile animal exists in the embryo, surrounded by abundant filth, floating in water, and distorted in its back, neck, and bones enduring severe pain even in the course of its developement, as disordered by the acid, acrid, bitter, pungent, and saline articles of its mothers food incapable of extending or contracting its limbs reposing amidst the slime of ordure and urine every way incommoded unable to breathe endowed with consciousness, and calling to memory many hundred previous births.
jāyamānaḥ purīṣāsṛṅmūtraśukrāvilānanaḥ / prājāpatyena vātena pīḍyamānāsthibandhanaḥ // adhomukho vai kriyate prabalaiḥ sūtimārutaiḥ / kleśānniṣkrāntimāpnoti jaṭharānmāturāturaḥ // murchāmavāpya mahatīṃ saṃspṛṣṭo bāhyavāyunā / vijñānabhraṃśamāpnoti jātaś ca munisattama //	When the child is about to be born, its face is besmeared by excrement, urine, blood, mucus, and semen its attachment to the uterus is ruptured by the Prājāpati wind it is turned head downwards, and violently expelled from the womb by the powerful and painful winds of parturition and the infant losing for a time all sensation, when brought in contact with the external air, is immediately deprived of its intellectual knowledge.
kaṇṭakair iva tunnāṅgaḥ krakacair iva dāritaḥ / pūtivraṇānnipatito dharaṇyāṃ krimiko yathā //	Thus born, the child is tortured in every limb, as if pierced with thorns, or cut to pieces with a saw, and falls from its fetid lodgment, as from a sore, like a crawling thing upon the earth.

śrīparāśara uvāca prahṛṣṭaḥsādhviti tataḥ prāha keśidhvajo nṛpaḥ / khāṇḍikyajanakaṃ prītyā śrūyatāṃ vacanaṃ mama // keśidhvaja uvāca	When king Keśidhwaja heard these words, he was much pleased, and exclaimed, “It is well spoken!” Then addressing Khāṇḍikya affectionately, he said, “Listen to my words.
ahaṃ hyavidyayā kṛtyuṃ tartukāmaḥ karomi vai / rājyaṃ yāgāṃś ca vividhānyogaiḥ puṇyakṣayaṃ tathā //	Through desire of escaping death by the ignorance of works I exercise the regal power, celebrate various sacrifices, and enjoy pleasures subversive of purity.
tadidaṃ te mano diṣṭyā vivekaiśvaryatāṃ gatam / tacchrūyatāmavidyāyāḥsvarūpaṃ kulanandana //	Fortunate is it for you that your mind has attached itself to the dominion of discrimination. Pride of your race! now listen to the real nature of ignorance.
anātmanyātmabuddhiryā cāsve svamiti yā matiḥ / saṃsāratarusaṃbhūtibījametaddvidhā sthitam //	The erroneous notion that self consists in what is not self, and the opinion that property consists in what is not ones own, constitute the double seed of the tree of ignorance.
pañcabhūtātmake dehe dehī mohatamovṛtaḥ / ahaṃ mamaitadityuccaiḥ kurute kumatirmatim // ākāśavāyvagnijalapṛthivībhyaḥ pṛthak sthite / ātmanyātmamayaṃ bhāvaṃ kaḥ karoti kalevare // kalevaropabhogyaṃhi gṛhakṣetrādikaṃ ca kaḥ / adehe hyātmani prājñe mamedamiti manyate // itthaṃ ca puttrapauttreṣu taddehotpāditeṣu kaḥ / karoti paṇḍitaḥsvāmyamanātmani kalevare // sarvaṃ dehopabhogāya kurute karma mānavaḥ / dehaścānyo yadā puṃsastadā bandhāya tatparam //	The ill judging embodied being, bewildered by the darkness of fascination, situated in a body composed of the five elements, loudly asserts, ‘This is I’ but who would ascribe spiritual individuality to a body in which soul is distinct from the ether, air, fire, water, and earth of which that body is composed? What man of understanding assigns to disembodied spirit corporeal fruition, or lands, houses, and the like, that it should say, ‘These are mine?’ What wise man entertains the idea of property in sous or grandsons begotten of the body after the spirit has abandoned it? Man performs all acts for the purpose of bodily fruition, and the consequence of such acts is another body so that their result is nothing but confinement to bodily existence.
mṛṇmayaṃ hi yathā gehaṃ lipyate vai mṛdaṃbhasā / pārthivo 'yaṃ tathā deho mṛdaṃbvālepanasthitaḥ //	In the same manner as a mansion of clay is plastered with clay and water, so the body, which is of earth, is perpetuated by earth and water or by eating and drinking.
pañjabhūtatmakair bhogoḥ pañcabhūtātmakaṃ vapuḥ / āpyāyate yadi tataḥ puṃso bhogo 'tra kiṃ kṛtaḥ // anekajanmasāhasrīṃ saṃsārapadavīṃ vrajan / mohaśramaṃ prayāto 'sau vāsanaremukuṇṭhitaḥ //	The body, consisting of the five elements, is nourished by substances equally composed of those elements but since this is the case, what is there in this life that man should be proud of? Travelling the path of the world for many thousands of births, man attains only the weariness of bewilderment, and is smothered by the dust of imagination.
prakṣālyate yadā sosya reṇujñānoṣṇavāriṇā / tadā saṃsārapānthasya yāti mohaśramaḥ śamam //	When that dust is washed away by the bland water of real knowledge, then the weariness of bewilderment sustained by the wayfarer through repeated births is removed.
mohaśrame śamaṃ yāte svasthāntaḥkaraṇaḥ pumān / ananyātiśayābādhaṃ paraṃ nirvāṇamṛcchati //	When that weariness is relieved, the internal man is at peace, and he obtains that supreme felicity which is unequalled and undisturbed.
nirvāṇamaya evāyam ātmā jñānamayo 'malaḥ / duḥkhājñānamayā dharmāḥ prakṛtes te tu nātmanaḥ //	This soul is of its own nature pure, and composed of happiness and wisdom. The properties of pain, ignorance, and impurity, are those of nature Prakriti, not of soul.
jalasya nāgnisaṃsargasthālīsaṃgāttathāpi hi / śabdodrekādikāndharmāṃstatkaroti yathā nṛpa //	There is no affinity between fire and water, but when the latter is placed over the former in a caldron it bubbles and boils, and exhibits the properties of fire.
tathātmā prakṛteḥsaṃgādahaṃmānādidūṣitaḥ / bhajate prākṛtān dharmān anyas tebhyo hi so 'vyayaḥ //	In like manner, when soul is associated with Prakriti it is vitiated by egotism and the rest, and assumes the qualities of grosser nature, although essentially distinct from them, and incorruptible.
tadetatkathitaṃ bījamavidyāyā mayā tava / kleśānāṃ ca kṣayakaraṃ yogādanyanna vidyate //	Such is the seed of ignorance, as I have explained it to you. There is but one cure of worldly sorrows, the practice of devotion no other is known.”
khāṇḍikya uvāca taṃ bravīhi mahābhāga yogaṃ yogaviduttama / vijñātayogaśāstrārthastvamasyāṃ nimisaṃtatau // keśidhvaja uvāca yogasvarūpaṃ khāṇḍikya śrūyatāṃ gadato mama / yatra sthito na cyavate prāpya brahmalayaṃ muniḥ //	“Then,” said Khāṇḍikya, “do you, who are the chief of those versed in contemplative devotion, explain to me what that is for in the race of the descendants of Nimi you are best acquainted with the sacred writings in which it is taught.” “Hear,” replied Keśidhwaja, “the account of, the nature of contemplative devotion, which I impart to you, and by perfection in which the sage attains resolution into Brahma, and never suffers birth again.
mana eva manuṣyāṇāṃ kāraṇaṃ bandhamokṣayoḥ / bandhāya viṣayāsaṃgi muktyai nirviṣayaṃ manaḥ //	The mind of man is the cause both of his bondage and his liberation its addiction to the objects of sense is the means of his bondage its separation from objects of sense is the means of his freedom.
viṣayebhyaḥ samāhṛtya vijñānātmāmano muniḥ / cintayenmuktaye tena brahmabhūtaṃ pareśvaram // ātmabhāvaṃ nayatyenaṃ tadbahya dhyāyinaṃ munim / vikāryamātmanaḥ śaktyā lohamākarṣako yathā // ātmaprayatnasāpekṣā viśiṣṭā yā manogatiḥ / tasya brahmaṇi saṃyogo yoga ityabhidhīyate //	The sage who is capable of discriminative knowledge must therefore restrain his mind from all the objects of sense, and therewith meditate upon the supreme being, who is one with spirit, in order to attain liberation for that supreme spirit attracts to itself him who meditates upon it, and who is of the same nature, as the loadstone attracts the iron by the virtue which is common to itself and to its products.
yogayuk prathamaṃ yogī yuñjāno hyabhidhīyate / viniṣpannasamādhistu paraṃ brahmopalabdhimān //	”The sage, or Yogi, when first applying himself to contemplative devotion is called the novice or practitioner Yoga yuj when he has attained spiritual union he is termed the adept, or he whose meditations are accomplished.
yadyantarāyadoṣeṇa dūṣyate cāsya mānasam / janmāntarair abhyasato muktiḥ purvasya jāyate //	Should the thoughts of the former be unvitiated by any obstructing imperfection, he will obtain freedom, after practising devotion through several lives.
viniṣpannasamādhistu muktiṃ tatraiva janmani / prāpnoti yogī yogāgnidagdhakarmacayo 'cirāt //	The latter speedily obtains liberation in that existence in which he reaches perfection, all his acts being consumed by the fire of contemplative devotion.
brahmacaryamahiṃsāṃ ca satyāsteyāparigrahān / seveta yogī niṣkāmo yogyatāṃ svamano nayan // svādhyāyaśaucasaṃtoṣatapāṃsi niyatātmavān / kurvīta brahmaṇi tathā parasminpravaṇaṃmanaḥ //	The sage who would bring his mind into a fit state for the performance of devout contemplation must be devoid of desire, and observe invariably continence, compassion, truth, honesty, and disinterestedness he must fix his mind intently on the supreme Brahma, practising holy study, purification, contentment, penance, and selfcontrol.
ete yamāḥsaniyamāḥ pañca pañca ca kīrtitāḥ / viśiṣṭaphaladāḥ kāmyā niṣkāmānāṃ vimuktidāḥ //	These virtues, respectively termed the five acts of restraint Yana, and five of obligation Niyama, bestow excellent rewards when practised for the sake of reward, and eternal liberation when they are not prompted by desire of transient benefits.
ekaṃ bhadrāsanādīnāṃ samāsthāya guṇair yutaḥ / yamākhyair niyamākhyaiś ca yuñjīta niyato yatiḥ //	Endowed with these merits, the sage self restrained should sit in one of the modes termed Bhadrāsana, &c., and engage in contemplation.
prāṇākhyamanilaṃ vaśyamabhyāsātkurute tu yat / prāṇāyāmaḥsavijñeyaḥsabījo 'bīja eva ca // paraspareṇābhibhavaṃ prāṇāpānau yathānilau / kurutaḥsadvidhānena tṛtīyaḥsaṃyamāttayoḥ //	Bringing his vital airs, called Prāṇā, under subjection, by frequent repetition, is thence called Prāṇāyāma, which is as it were a seed with a seed. In this the breath of expiration and that of inspiration are alternately obstructed, constituting the act twofold and the suppression of both modes of breathing produces a third.
tasya cālaṃbanavataḥ sthūlarūpaṃ dvijottama / ālaṃbanamanantasya yogino 'bhyasataḥ smṛtam //	The exercise of the Yogi, whilst endeavouring to bring before his thoughts the gross form of the eternal, is denominated Ālambana.
śabdādiṣvanuraktāni nigṛhyākṣāṇi yogavit / kuryāccittānukārīṇi pratyāhāraparāyaṇaḥ //	He is then to perform the Pratyāhāra, which consists in restraining his organs of sense from susceptibility to outward impressions, and directing them entirely to mental perceptions.
vaśyatā paramā tena jāyateti calātmanām / indriyāṇāmavaśyais tair na yogī yogasādhakaḥ //	By these means the entire subjugation of the unsteady senses is effected and if they are not controlled, the sage will not accomplish his devotions.
prāṇayāmena pavane pratyāhāreṇa cendriye / vaśīkṛte tataḥ kuryātsthitaṃ cetaḥ śubhāśraye //	When by the Prāṇāyāma the vital airs are restrained, and the senses are subjugated by the Pratyāhāra, then the sage will he able to keep his mind steady in its perfect asylum."

trividhā bhāvanā bhūpa viśvametannibodhatām / brahmākhyā karmasaṃjñā ca tathā caivobhayātmikā // karmabhāvātmikā hyekābrahmabhāvātmikā parā / ubhayātmikā tathaivānyā trividhā bhāvabhāvanā //	Apprehension of spirit, again, is threefold. I will explain the different kinds to you they are, that which is called Brahma, that which is named from works, and that which comprehends both. That mental apprehension which consists of Brahma is one that which is formed of works is another and that which comprehends both is the third so that mental apprehension of the object or asylum of the thoughts is threefold.
sanandanādayo ye tu brahmabhāvanayā yutāḥ / karmabhāvanayā cānye devādyāḥ sthāvarāvarāḥ //	The gods and others, whether animate or inanimate, are possessed of that which regards acts.
hiraṇyagarbhādiṣu ca brahmakarmātmikā dvidhā / bodhādhikārayukteṣu vidyate bhāvabhāvanā // akṣīṇeṣu samasteṣu viśeṣajñānakarmasu / viśvametatparaṃ cānyadbhedabhinnadṛśāṃ nṛṇām // pratyastamitabhedaṃ yatsattāmātramagocaram / vacasāmātmasaṃvedyaṃ tajjñānaṃ brahmasaṃjñitam //	The apprehension that comprehends both works and spirit exists in Hiraṇyagarbha and others, who are possessed of contemplative knowledge of their own nature, and who also exercise certain active functions, as creation and the rest. Until all acts, which are the causes of notions of individuality, are discontinued, spirit is one thing, and the universe is another, to those who contemplate objects as distinct and various but that is called true knowledge, or knowledge of Brahma, which recognises no distinctions, which contemplates only simple existence, which is undefinable by words, and is to be discovered solely in ones own spirit.
tacca viṣṇoḥ paraṃ rūpamarūpākhyamanuttamam / viśvasvarūpavairūpyalakṣaṇaṃ paramātmanaḥ //	That is the supreme, unborn, imperishable form of Viṣṇu, who is without sensible form, and is characterised as a condition of the supreme soul, which is variously modified from the condition of universal form.
na tadyogayujā śakyaṃ nṛpa cintayituṃyataḥ / tataḥsthūlaṃ hare rūpaṃ cintayedviśvagocaram //	But this condition cannot be contemplated by sages in their early devotions, and they must therefore direct their minds to the gross form of Hari, which is of universal perceptibility.
hiraṇyagarbho bhagavānvāsudevaḥ prajāpatiḥ / maruto vasavo rudrā bhāskarāstārakā grahāḥ // gandharvayakṣadaityādyaḥsakalā devayonayaḥ / manuṣyāḥ paśavaḥ śailāḥsamudrāḥsarito drumāḥ // bhūpa bhūtānyaśeṣāṇi bhūtānāṃ ye ca hetavaḥ / pradhānādiviśeṣāntaṃ cetanācetanātmakam // ekapādaṃ dvipādaṃ ca bahupādamapādakam / mūrtametaddhare rūpaṃ bhāvanātritayātmakam //	They must meditate upon him as Hiraṇyagarbha, as the glorious Vāsava, as Prajāpati, as the winds, the Vasus, the Rudras, the suns, stars, planets, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Daityas, all the gods and their progenitors, men, animals, mountains, oceans, rivers, trees, all beings, and all sources of beings, all modifications whatever of nature and its products, whether sentient or unconscious, onefooted, twofooted, or manyfooted all these are the sensible form of Hari, to be apprehended by the three kinds of apprehension.
etatsarvamidaṃ viśvaṃ jagadetaccarācaram / parabrahmasvarūpasya viṣṇoḥ śaktisamanvitam //	All this universal world, this world of moving and stationary beings, is pervaded by the energy of Viṣṇu, who is of the nature of the supreme Brahma.
viṣṇuśaktiḥ parā proktā kṣetrajñākhyā tathāparā / avidyākarmasaṃjñānyā tṛtīyā śaktiriṣyate // yayā kṣetrajñaśaktiḥsā veṣṭitā nṛpasarvagā / saṃsāratāpānakhilānavāprotyatisaṃtatān //	This energy is either supreme, or, when it is that of conscious embodied spirit, it is secondary. Ignorance, or that which is denominated from works, is a third energy by which the omnipresent energy of embodied spirit is ever excited, and whence it suffers all the pains of repeated worldly existence.
tayā tirohitatvācca śaktiḥ kṣetrajñasaṃjñitā / sarvabhūteṣu bhūpāla tāratamyenalakṣyate //	Obscured by that energy of ignorance or illusion, the energy that is denominated from embodied spirit is characterised by different degrees of perfection in all created beings.
aprāṇavatsusvalpā sā sthāvareṣu tato 'dhikā / sarīsṛpeṣu tebhyopi hyatiśaktyā patattriṣu // pātattriṃbhyo mṛgāstebhyastacchaktyā paśavo 'dhikāḥ / paśubhyo manujāścātiśaktyā puṃsaḥ prabhāvitāḥ //	In things without life it exists in a very small degree it is more in things that have life, but are without motion in insects it is still more abundant, and still more in birds it is more in wild animals, and in domestic animals the faculty is still greater men have more of this spiritual.
tebhyopi nāgagandharvayakṣādyā devatā nṛpa // śakraḥsamastadevebhyastataścātiprajāpatiḥ / hiraṇyagarbho 'pi tataḥ puṃsaḥ śaktyupalakṣitaḥ // etānyaśeṣarūpāṇi tasya rūpāṇi pārthiva / yatastacchaktiyogena yuktāni nabhasā yathā //	faculty than animals, and thence arises their authority over them the faculty exists in an ascending degree in Nāgas, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, gods, Śakra, Prajāpati, and Hiraṇyagarbha and is above all predominant in that male Viṣṇu of whom all these various creatures are but the diversified forms, penetrated universally by his energy, as allpervading as the ether.
śubhāśrayasya cittasya sarvagasyācalātmanaḥ / tribhāvabhāghanātīto muktaye yogino nṛpa //	"When the Yogi has accomplished this stage, he acquires discriminative knowledge, which is the means of enabling living soul, when all the three kinds of apprehension are destroyed, to attain the attainable supreme Brahma.
samasthitorujaṅghaṃ ca susthitāṅghrivarāṃbujam / cintayedbrahmabhūtaṃ taṃ pītanirmalavāsasam //	Embodied spirit is the user of the instrument, which instrument is true knowledge and by it that identification of the former with Brahma is attained.
kirīṭahārakeyūrakaṭakādivibhūṣitam //	Liberation, which is the object to be effected, being accomplished, discriminative knowledge ceases.
tadbhāvabhāvamāpannastato 'sau paramātmanā / bhavatyabhedī bhedaś ca tasyājñānakṛto bhavet //	When endowed with the apprehension of the nature of the object of inquiry, then, there is no difference between it individual and supreme spirit difference is the consequence of the absence of true knowledge.
vibhedajanake jñāne nāśamātyantikaṃ gate / ātmano brahmaṇo bhedama saṃtaṃ kaḥ karīṣyati // ityuktaste mayā yogaḥ khāṇḍikya paripṛcchataḥ / saṃkṣepavistarābhyāṃ tu kimanyatkriyatāṃ tava //	When that ignorance which is the cause of the difference between individual and universal spirit is destroyed finally and for ever, who shall ever make that distinction between them which does not exist? Thus have I, Khāṇḍikya, in reply to your question, explained to you what is meant by contemplative devotion, both fully and summarily.
khāṇḍikya uvāca kathite yogasadbhāve sarvameva kṛtaṃ mama / tavopadeśenāśeṣo naṣṭaścittamalo yataḥ //	Khāṇḍikya replied to Keśidhwaja, and said, “The explanation which you have given me of the real nature of contemplative devotion has fulfilled all my wishes, and removed all impurity from my mind.
mameti yanmayā coktamasadetanna cānyathā / naredra gadituṃ śakyamapi vijñeyavedibhiḥ // ahaṃ mametyavidyeyaṃ vyavahārastathānayoḥ / paramārthastvasaṃlāpo gocare vacasāṃ na yaḥ //	The expression ‘mine,’ which I have been accustomed to use, is untruth, and cannot be otherwise declared by those who know what is to be known. The words ‘I’ and ‘mine’ constitute ignorance but practice is influenced by ignorance. Supreme truth cannot be defined, for it is not to be explained by words.
tadgaccha śreyase sarvaṃ mamaitadbhavatā kṛtam / yadvimuktiprado yogaḥ proktaḥ keśidhvajāvyayaḥ // śrīparāśara uvāca	Depart therefore, Keśidhwaja you have done all that is necessary for my real happiness, in teaching me contemplative devotion, the inexhaustible bestower of liberation from existence.”
yathārhaṃ pūjayā tena khāṇḍikyena sa pūjitaḥ / ājagāma puraṃ brahmaṃstataḥ keśidhvajo nṛpaḥ //	Accordingly king Keśidhwaja, after receiving suitable homage from Khāṇḍikya, returned to his city.
khāṇḍikyo 'pi sutaṃ kṛtvā rājānaṃ yogasiddaye / vanaṃ jagāma govinde viniveśitamānasaḥ // tatraikāntamatirbhūtvā yamādiguṇasaṃyutaḥ / viṣṇvākhye nirmale brahmaṇy avāpa nṛpatir layam //	Khāṇḍikya, having nominated his son Rājā, retired to the woods to accomplish his devotions, his whole mind being intent upon Govinda there his entire thoughts being engrossed upon one only object, and being purified by practices of restraint, selfcontrol, and the rest, he obtained absorption into the pure and perfect spirit which is termed Viṣṇu.
keśidhvajo vimuktyarthaṃ svakarmakṣapaṇonmukhaḥ / bubhuje viṣayānkarma cakre cānabhisaṃhitam // akalyāṇopabhogaiś ca kṣīṇapāpo 'malas tathā / avāpa siddhimatyantāṃ tāpakṣayaphalāṃ dvija //	Keśidhwaja also, in order to attain liberation, became averse from his own perishable works, and lived amidst objects of sense without regarding them, and instituted religious rites without expecting therefrom any advantages to himself. Thus by pure and auspicious fruition, being cleansed from all sin, the also obtained that perfection which assuages all affliction for ever.

If there is any thing else you wish to hear, propose your question, and I will answer it.

The man who with wellgoverned passions bathes at Mathurā on the twelfth day of the month Jyeṣṭha, and beholds the image of Hari, obtains a great recompense so does he who with mind fixed upon Keśava attentively recites this Purāṇa.

tābhyāṃ ca nāgarājāya proktaṃ vāsukaye dvija / vāsukiḥ prāha vatsāya vatsaścāśvatarāya vai // kaṃbalāya ca tenoktamelāputrāya tena vai //	The goddess delivered it to Dhritarāṣṭra the Nāga king, and to Purāṇa of the same race, by whom it was repeated to their monarch Vāsuki.

He who reads and retains with faith this Purāṇa, in the beginning, middle, and end of which is described the glorious Achyuta, the lord of the universe in every stage, the master of all that is stationary or moveable, composed of spiritual knowledge, acquires such purity as exists not in any world, the eternal state of perfection, which is Hari.

Should not that Hari be heard of, whom those devoted to acts worship with sacrifices continually as the god of sacrifice whom those devoted to meditation contemplate as primary and secondary, composed of spirit by obtaining whom man is not born, nor nourished, nor subjected to death who is all that is, and that is not or both cause and of effect who, as the progenitors, receives the libations made to them who, as the gods, accepts the offerings addressed to them the glorious being who is without beginning or end whose name is both Svāhā and Swadhā who is the abode of all spiritual power in whom the limits of finite things cannot be measured and who, when he enters the ear, destroys all sin?

I constantly adore him, who is entitled heaven, air, fire, water, earth, and ether who is the bestower of all the objects which give gratification to the senses who benefits mankind with the instruments of fruition who is perceptible, who is subtile, who is imperceptible.
iti śrīviṣṇumahāpurāṇaṃ samāptam	May that unborn, eternal Hari, whose form is manifold, and whose essence is composed of both nature and spirit, bestow upon all mankind that blessed state which knows neither birth nor decay!
