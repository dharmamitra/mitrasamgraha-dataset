In the same way, also the Constructive Ideation appearing in the not in itself existing aspect of subject and object is called non-substantial, as to [that] duality in order to remove the attachment of the ignorant to the [erroneous] notion [concerning the real existence of subject and object as independent entities].

This again is the non-absolute-existence of subject and object as real, [independent] entities.

The Characteristic of Being is a universal, a general [characteristic] ; the Particular Characteristic is a special, an individual property.

By force of that [transformation] the consciousness arises in mutually differentiated appearances.

Because the appearances as things and sentient beings become manifest in the form of objects, in the meaning of,,anākāratva", i.e. being without perception is implied the non-existence of real external objects, since the appearances [as ego-substance and ideas], being of an unreal nature, cannot have real existence.

On the other hand, although [subject and object] do not exist as real, [independent] entities, it is called "svabhāva", "nature, aspect", because they exist in conformity to wordly, phenomenal experience.

Neither [is it possible that the consciousness, when already] arisen [should depend on objects], because [the consciousness, when] arisen, exists as a substance, an essence which appears [in the aspect of some] object.

[For a part cannot have another nature than the whole.

For, as the subject depends on the object one might easily penetrate into the non-existence of an external object which is to be perceived 84 )because the nature of object of perception has been eliminated. [For there would be no subject which could perceive that object of perception].

For it seems to be impossible that the Worlds of Carnal Desire and Pure Matter [could exist] in the mere Constructive Ideation [in which no duality exists, as stated above]. [If one should assume that] through a differentiation into spheres of existence a discrimination into Saints, [ordinary wordly beings], etc. would not obtain, [whereas this differentiation is attended] by a [corresponding] differentiation into defilement and purification, a great and absurd transgression of the doctrine would be the consequence.

The mind and mental phenomena come forward [and are active] through the productive imagination of a real, independent nature and the special qualities of a thing imaginable. The mind and mental phenomena [on the one hand] and the Constructive Ideation [on the other hand] are synonyms in as much as their inherent nature is concerned, since they both [correspond to] the perception of a real substance and the special qualities of a thing.

The implied meaning of "in it" is that the mental phenomena, being in [that store-] consciousness, are also the fruit, the effect thereof; for they are [in reality] vijñāna and share its good or bad destiny. Indeed, because the store-consciousness is the condition of the other forms of consciousness, it is [called] consciousness in the quality of condition.

Samjñā, ideation, is the exact discernment of that which has been felt, [by vedana-upabhoga] since it consists of the grasping, the "abstracting" of the different special characteristics, such as pleasure etc.

It understands that [supermundane wisdom] The application thereof is the result of study, investigation, and meditation. That is why it is called true real insight.
bhūtadarśana vibandhādavidyā saṃskārāṇāṃ pratyaya ityevaṃ chādanāda "vidyayā kliśyate jagaditi /	And because the "Transcendental Illusion" is the obstruction thereof, it is the condition of the samskāras the "formative forces of phenomenal existence". In this manner the Universe is defiled by Avidyā on account of its being enshrouded [thereby].
ropaṇāt " kliśyate jagad iti" sambandhaḥ /	Because it "establishes", the Universe is defiled.

na cādhipatyamātreṇaiva vidyā saṃskārāṇāṃ pratyayaḥ sāmānyapratyayenāpi hi samutthānaṃ bhavati /	And it is not solely owing to its predominance that avidyā is called the condition of the samskāras, [but especially] because it is the universal [and simultaneous] condition.
tathā hyavidyā sarvakleśasamprayuktatvādyathā kleśasamutyānāṃ sāmānyena samutthānapratyaya stathā tatsamutthānāṃ cetanānāmapi /	Indeed, because avidyā is associated with all the "passions", it is the samanyapratyaya, the common and simultaneous condition even of the cetanã, the "volition", the "will" which has its origin in and arises together with the klesas, the passions, just as it is the samanyapratyaya of the passions, which have their origin in and arise at the same time as [avidyā itself].

Now, so far as [this] simultaneous origination is concerned, avidyā which arises together and at the same time with those [passions], is the Universal and simultaneous condition. Therefore, because avidyā, existing and arising together with them, is the samãnyapratyaya even of the non-agitated [samskāras] which arise simultaneously with the views that are detached from those [good and bad] states of consciousness, it is called the pratyaya, the condition of the samskāras, the formative forces.
vijñāna mitauhālaya vijñānamabhipretaṃ na tu pravṛttivijñānaṃ /	"Vijñāna" is to be understood here in the sense of "Alayavijñāna", store-consciousness, but not in the sense of "Pravṛttivijñāna", active consciousness.
santānocchedena " pravṛttivijñānena co" tpattisthānanayanāsambhavāt /	For it is not possible that a pravṛttivijñāna that has come to an end [in a certain individual existence] is led into the condition of re-birth.

karmavāsanāyā iti / kā punariyaṃ karmavāsanā nāma /	As to the karmavāsanās, what is it really that is called karmavāsanā? They are the seed of a future birth [and as such] "cause-substance".
yathā brauhiphalasya bhūmirajovāyvādipratyaya viśeṣāpekṣasya pariṇāmeṇāṅkurodbhavahetubhāvo baujamiti /	In the same manner the grain of rice is the seed [and as such] the cause-substance of the origination of [new] sprouts, through a development in the end which depends on certain conditions. such as land, ashes, manure and so forth.

pratiṣṭhāpanaṃ punara prathamaḥ paricchedaḥ vijñānasantāne tatprathamatastaddaujasyāpyāyanaṃ /	It means the augmentation from the very beginning of the seeds [of a new birth] in the vijñānasantāna, the "stream of life", the "stream of consciousness".
na hi kasyacitsāsrava "sya dharmasyānātravasya" vā'pūrvaṃ baujamādhīyate /	For no seed is "conceived" of any dharma, either impure or pure, which did not exist before.

Since the agent, the place or the object of [this] leading are not known, the commentator says: In consequence of [its] being conveyed by Vijñāna to the place where it will take birth. "Leading" means that the impregnations of acts which have become the seed of a new existence are conveyed to the place where they are to take birth from the place of their departing [a previous life] in consequence of the action of continuance by the act-perfumed life-consciousness.
evameva hi na pratisandhivijñānapratyayaḥ saṃskāraḥ /	Now if this be so, the pratisamdhivijñāna "the first moment of a new life, the moment of conception" is not conditioned by the samskāras, the prenatal and formative forces.
pūrvakālaunaṃ bhavavijñāname va saṃskārapratyayamiti pradarśitaṃ bhavati /	It has been shown that on the contrary the purvakālabhavavijñana, the existence after the conception and before death is dependent on the formative forces.

As nãmarūpa, the complex of "soul" and body, the embryo?. On account of the "embracing" the world is defiled.
nāmarūpaṃ hi pañcaskandhāḥ /	For nāma and rūpa are the five skandhas.

yathā sarvaṃ saṃskṛtaṃ pañcabhi : skandhaiḥ saṅgṛhautamiti /	38, separate [from each other] although not different; just as "everything conditioned" is enclosed by the five skandhas [and still is separate from them].
aupapādukānāṃ tu vijñānapratyayaṃ ṣaḍāyatanameveti /	But with the "apparitional beings" the six sense-organs indeed, have only vijñāna as condition [and not nāmarüpa].

● ●ṭīkā pūraṇāt ( ) kliśyate jagad iti kena pūraṇātva" kasya ceti ṣaḍāyatanena / nāmarūpasaṅgṛhauta ātmabhāvaḥ/	Because of the "completing" [the world] is defiled. As regards the agent or object of the "completing" [the commentator] says: It is the support, the body comprised by nama and rūpa [which is completed] by the ṣaḍāyatana, the [formation of the] six sense-organs.
evaṃ nāmarūpāvasthāyāṃ cakṣurādyāyatanānāmabhāvādā tmabhāvo'paripūrṇa iti /	For in the "nāmarüpa"-state, the body is called incomplete because the eyeand other sense-organs are [still] absent.

* ci paricchedāt kliśyate jagad itisambandhaḥ/	Because of the "definite perception" [caused] by the three" the world is defiled.

The definite perception [which results from] that threefold modification of the sense-organ which is liable to arouse pleasant and other feelings is [called] sparsa, "definite sensation", "contact".
ataevā yamindriyavikārasādṛśyaṃ spṛśati tadākāratayeti sparśa uccate /	Hence it is called sparsa, because it is that "contact-knowledge" which arises in concomitance with the aspects of the modifications of the sense-organs.

Because there is projection [the world is defiled].
saṅgrahā t kena kasya veti na karmākṣiptasya" punarbhavasyeti /	Now, since neither the agent nor the object of [this] projection are known the commentator says: The agent is "craving", "thirst" and the object [i.e. the result] is re-birth projected by the acts.

It is the causa of a desire for a "body" in a new existence, indiscriminately in all the destinies. [This new existence is] projected by the "feeding", of the "seeds" of that new existence in the [ālaya-] vijñāna [and this "feeding" is accomplished] by the samskāras, the formative, prenatal forces. [These seeds are "moistened" by the craving-water and it is exactly] by this moistening that the re-birth is "harmonized" with birth and birth [itself] fixed.

tathā hi chandarāgavaśāvijñānaṃ tatrāvatiṣṭha te /	For, the vijñāna, the life-consciousness proceeds and descends in a new birth by force of desire and covetousness.

Here also, when questioned about this by some one, he states: Because a performed act is directed as "bhava" in order to produce the "maturing" of a new birth. The fettering of the vijñana [results from] acts which have been performed formerly [in a previous existence. These acts] produce re-birth.

Because they [are active in a previous existence and] acquire origination [in a new existence] they are bhava, "existence". [or rather] "becoming", active as well as projected.

For the vijñāna, the life-consciousness Y. coagulates in sperm and blood from the very beginning at [the moment of] the impregnation.

And [the world] is also defiled, because it is inevitable that the mother [is subject] to difficulties with regard to [the taking of] food and restricted in her freedom of movement.
saṅkaṭenāśucinā mārgeṇa nirgacchatauti kliśyate jagat /	Again [the embryo] leaves [the womb] by a narrow and impure channel and in this manner, too, the world is defiled.

And thus again the world is defiled.

sajātīyāvasthātaḥ kṣaṇikāvasthāṃ gacchatautyarthaḥ /	Universal Motion because it moves. This means in reality that it [i.e. the world, phenomenal existence] moves on from a common universal condition towards momentariness.
kliśyata iti jātijarāvyādhimaraṇādibhi svaidhātuke" kṣaṇaparamparayā" javajavībhāvena ** paudhata ityarthaḥ /	"Klisyate, is defiled": The true meaning is that [phenomenal life or wordly existence] is afflicted by birth, decay, disease and death and so forth in [all] the three spheres of existence, since it consists of its coming and going as a regular uninterrupted sequence of [coherent] moments.
kliśyata iti na vyavadāyata ityapare /	Others however maintain that "klisyate, is defiled" 1. means that [phenomenal life] is not purified.

Again, [asked] of how many kinds the [universal] defilement consists which has been briefly explained to consist of this twelvefold [chain] of dependent origination, [the following] has accordingly been stated: This very twelvefold [chain] of dependent origination is: "Threefold and twofold defilement, sevenfold".
iti śabdaḥ samuccaya arthaka: /	The word "ca", "and" is used in the connotations of collectivity and repetition.
kleśa eva saṃkleśa iti kleśa saṃkleśaḥ /	Because samklesa, defilement is in reality klesa, passion it is [called] kleśasamkleśa, defilement through passion.
evaṃ karma saṃkleśo janmasaṃkleśaḥ /	The same is the case with karmasamklesa, defilement through action and janmasamkleśa, defilement through birth, individual existence.
kleśo hi pravartamānaḥ sva parātmanorvyābādhakatvātsaṃkleśaḥ /	For klesa, passion is defilement because by its action it hurts oneself and others.

evaṃ dveṣamohayorapi jñātavyamiti /	This applies also to dveşa, hatred and moha, folly.

And it is in reality the cause of the defilement through birth, because [at the time of the conception] it fetters the defiled mind to the [actual] reincarnation in a new birth.
ata eva rhataḥ kliṣṭacittābhāvānna pratisandhiḥ /	Therefore, because the arhat, the "saint" has no defiled mind he is not bound by actual reincarnation.
karma ca śubhama"śubhaṃ tadā kāyacittayorāyāsanimittatvādāyatyāṃ ca vipākadānātsaṃkleśaḥ /	And Karma, action, pure as well as impure, is defilement because it has the characteristic of bodily and mental exertion in present actual life and because it produces "maturing" in future time [i.e. the maturing of a new birth].
janmāpi sarvopadravāspadatvātsaṃkleśa iti tredhā saṃkleśo hetordidhābhedāt /	And janman, too, is defilement because it is the abode of all calamity and mischief. Defilement is threefold because of a twofold differentiation of the cause.

karmasaṃkleśaḥ saṃskārā bhavaśce° tyubhayorapi karmātmaka tvāt /	The defilement through action [becomes] the samskāras, the formative forces and bhava, action that produces "reëxistence", because even these two have karma, action as substance.
ayaṃ tu viśeṣaḥ / svarūpāvasthaṃ karma saṃskāro baujāvasthaṃ bhava iti /	But there is the following difference: Karma, action, existing in itself, by its own right constitutes the samskāras, the formative forces; and karma, action, in the condition of seed is bhava, action that produces "reëxistence".

For, [all] these are contained in janma, individual existence.

phalasaṃkleśaśca śeṣairvijñānādibhiḥ karmakleśaphalatvāt /	And defilement in the condition of effect [is represented] by the remaining [members], i.e. vijñāna etc. because they are the effect of karma, action and klesa, passion.

tatra viparyāsa heturavidyeti /	Avidyā, ignorance is in this respect the cause of viparyāsa, Y.
avidyāgato hi tattvasammohādanityādaunnityādirūpeṇa viparyasyati /	For, that which has come into existence by reason of ignorance is called "perversion", because it errs with regard to the "truth" in so far as it considers the impermanent to be permanent and so on.
ākṣepahetuḥ saṃskārā iti " / vijñāne caturaṅgātmakajanmabījaṃ hi nikṣipyate /	The samskāras, the formative forces are the cause of ākṣepa, "projection, establishment", because they establish in the vijñāna, the seed of individual existence comprising four members [of the chain of dependent origination].
upanayanaheturvijñānam itauha cyutasya janmaviṣayo panayanāt /	Vijñāna, life-consciousness is the cause of "leading" because of its being led into the sphere of conception-birth from death [in the previous individual existence].

athavā nāmarū peṇa tatprathamata ātmabhāvamātrasya saṅgraho vivakṣitaḥ /	Or rather, at first the intention was to explain that by nâmarūpa is to be understood the "holding together" of the mere "personality", the "body".

They exist in the state of vāsanã, "seeds" which, being ripened, become bhava, "becoming" or "the procreative act", since they assume a function.

janmākṣepāttatra tatra sattvanikāye jātijarāmaraṇaduḥkhamanyacca śokaparideva/ duḥkhaṃ daurmanasyopāyāsaduḥkhamanantaprabhedamanubhavatīti /	That is the case here because one experiences, when the birth is projected, sorrow in endless variety in such and such a group of sentient beings. It is the pain [which inheres in] birth, decay and death as well as the pain of grief and lamenting and the pain of dejection and mental unrest.
tatra tridhā saṃkleśābhidhānena kleśakarmaṇorjanmanaḥ sādhāraṇāsādhāraṇahetutvaṃ darśitaṃ /	Now, the definition "defilement is a threefold" indicates that Y.

For, passion is a common cause for the "sprouting" of [all] individual existence just as the earth etc.
tadbhedena janmabhedāt /	For, individual existence is differentiated by the differentiation of that [karma, action seed].
athavā nātra pūrvāntāparāntamadhyāntāni cauṇi kāṇḍāni / kiṃ tarhi/ karmakleśaphalānauti pradarśayati /	Or rather, although the three periods of past, present and future [according to absolute truth] do not really exist here, [the author] nevertheless explains the fruits, of passion and action [from the relative, phenomenal point of view].
dvidhābhidhānena hetuphalamātramevedaṃ nātrānyaḥ saṃkliśyate kārako vedako veti pradarśayati /	By the definition "[defilement] is twofold", he points out that this is only cause and effect. There is no other "creator" or "experiencer" here, who is subject to defilement.
athavāca karmakleśamācaṃ kāraṇaṃ tayorbhāvābhāvājjanmabhāvābhāva darśanāt /	Or rather, only action and passion are indeed the cause here. For it has been taught that the existence as well as the non-existence of individual existence [respectively depend on] the existence and non-existence of both [passion and action].
atastatphalameva janma /	Hence individual existence is indeed the effect, the fruit thereof.
tasmānnāca hetuḥ phalaṃ vā / sarvaca pañcaskandhikāvastheti pra darśayati /	That is why he shows that it is no cause or effect [which in reality exists] here, but that [they] always [exist in] the state of the five skandhas.

For, the agent, the manner and the object of this projection have been shown. The characteristic of "realization" [is represented] by five members. It is a realization of what has been projected. [Here follows a short explanation of] the manner in which it is accomplished and also of the distress [which accompanies] this realization.
kenākṣipyate / avidyāpratyayaiḥ saṃskāraiḥ /	What is the agent of this projection? The formative forces, which are conditioned by Ignorance.
kathaṃ / tattvamohādiparyāsasaṃjñā kuśalākuśalā niñjyān saṃskārānabhi saṃskaroti /	In what manner [are they conditioned by Ignorance]? Ignorance forms such samskāras which are good, bad and non-agitated, in so far as one, being mistaken as to the true nature of the absolute truth gets entangled into perverted ideas.
kathamākṣipyate saṃskāraiḥ / vijñānabaujapoṣaṇādutpattibhavyatāyā "mavasthāpanāt / kimākṣipyate/	In what manner is the projection accomplished bij these samskāras? [The projection is accomplished] because they develop [i.e. impregnate] the seeds in the vijñāna and therefore fix birth in futurity.
paunarbhavikaṃ nāmarūpaṃ ṣaḍāyatanaṃ sparśo vedanā ca yathāyogaṃ /	What is the object of the projection? That which is potential of re-birth, i.e. the "embryo", the "six bases of cognition", "definite sensation" and "feeling" respectively.
tadevamākṣitaṃ kenābhinirvartyate / yathoktena krameṇa pūrvākṣepādihotpannāṃ vedanāṃ pratautya yā tṛṣṇotpa nnā tatpratyayenopādānena /	By what agent is the realization effected of that which has thus been projected? As has been explained, [is is realized] in regular course by those attachments which are conditioned by that craving which originates while depending on those feelings which arise here, because they are projected previously [in a former individual existence].
kathaṃ tenābhinirvartyate /	In what manner is this the cause of the realization? 57T.

Since various formative forces are being developed, manifold impregY. nations-of-acts are present in the vijñāna.

That is not to the point. For this would undo the knowledge, that when one existence has been completely cut off by death a new birth-existence arises.
eṣa sarvaḥ saṃkleśo 'bhūtaparikalpātpravartata iti / citta caittāśrayatvātsaṃkleśasya /	All these defilements originate in consequence of the Constructive Ideation, since the mind and mental phenomena are the basis of defilement.

It has been recognized by him that, whereas the Constructive Ideation is defilement as well as the background of the knowledge of the elements of existence, the Non-Substantiality is purification as well as the penetration into the Ultimate Essence of things existing, [i.e. the Absolute]. Immediately after the exposition of the Constructive Ideation he therefore, sets forth, in what sense the Non-Substantiality should be understood: The Essence, moreover the synonyms, etc.
tatra lakṣaṇaṃ bhāvābhāvapratiṣedhātmakaṃ śū nyatāyāḥ sarva"prabhedavyāpakatvāt /	[The Non-Substantiality] in this respect is characterized by that [monistic] essence which transcends the reality as well as the unreality [of phenomenal existence], because, in its various forms, it pervades everything.

Although [the essential nature of the Non-Substantiality is], just like infinite space, undifferentiated and beyond discriminative thought, [we speak of its] differentiation [in so far as we see] a difference in its being united with the "external" defiling forces and in its being separated therefrom.
anyacca puhaladharmasamāropabhedena bhedaḥ ṣoḍaśavidhaḥ /	And [we speak of] a sixteenfold differentiation in so far as [the Non-Substantiality is seen in its imputed aspect i.e. in so far as] reality is ascribed to individual existence and to the separate elements of existence.
sādhanaṃ śūnyatāprabhedapradarśane yuktiḥ //	The logical proof [conveys] the reason for showing the different [aspects] of the Non-Substantiality.
kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ yadebhiḥ prakāraiḥ śūnyatā vijñātavyā /	Again, what is the reason that the NonSubstantiality should be understood by means of these [different] aspects.
viśuddhyālambanatvād viśuddhyarthibhirlakṣaṇato vijñeyā /	Since it is the object of purification, it is to be known in accordance with its essence, by [those sentient beings] who are desirous of spiritual purification.
na cānta re ṣu paryāyanirdeśeṣṭhasammohārthaṃ paryāyataḥ /	In order not to be deluded as to similar doctrines in other sūtras [we must penetrate into the nature of the Non-Substantiality] by means of its synonyms.
paryāyārthāvabodhārthaṃ śūnyatāyāṃ viśuḍyālambanatvaniyamāya paryāyārthataḥ /	The meaning of a synonym should convey the exact meaning of [the word of which it is] a synonym: the NonSubstantiality in this respect is defined as the object of purification.
saṃkleśāpanaye tadiśuddhiriti saṃ kleśahāṇāya prayatnotpādanārthaṃ bhedataḥ /	Because it is purified as soon as [its] defilement is destroyed [one should understand it] by means of its differentiations, in order to produce the exertion [which is necessary] to renounce this defilement.
bheda sādhanāvabodhādhikārābhāve satyapi bhedaṃ sukhaṃ " pratipadyata iti bhedasādhanato'pi vijñeyeti // • kathaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ vijñeya miti /	It must also be known by means of the logical proof [which establishes these] differentiations. For a differentiation [of the Non-Substantiality] might easily be realized if the logical proof concerning this differentiation is thoroughly understood, although, [viewed in the light of the Monistic Essence of the Absolute] there is no change [whatever in the Non-Substantiality].
lakṣaṇaṃ hi prāguddiṣṭaṃ tasmāttadeva prathamaṃ pṛccyate /	[In the Kārikās] the Essence [of the Non-Substantiality] is expounded first.

By the Essence of the Non-Substantiality should be understood the unreality of duality as well as the real background of that unreality Duality i.e. subject and object does not substantially exist in the Constructive Ideation or as Constructive Ideation, because it is of an imputed nature.
tasya ca iyābhāvasya yo bhāva etacchūnyatāyā lakṣaṇaṃ /	Now, the real background of this unreality of duality is the Essence of the Non-Substantiality.
kārikānuguṇyāccātra bhāvapratyayo lupta " nirdeśo draṣṭavyaḥ /	We should understand that in the Karikā [the last syllable of "sünyata"] has been omitted metri causa.
abhāvasya bhāvaśceti" prathamaḥ paricchedaḥ tvāt / kimetau / abhāvasyātmā vidyamāna eva /	What is it, that is really meant by this real background of the unreality [of duality]? The unreality [of the separate existence of duality] finds its background in the Monistic Essence of Absolute Existence.
anyathā yasya bhāvo vidyamāna eva syāttadabhāvasya" bhāvato'vidyamāna/	Otherwise, if the Non-Substantiality, [i.e. the Monistic Essence] should not be the [sole] reality of that [duality], duality would be real in itself.
ata evāha ityabhāva svabhāvalakṣaṇatvaṃ śūnyatāyāḥ paridaupitaṃ bhavati na bhāvarūpalakṣaṇamiti /	Therefore he says: So the essential nature of the Non-Substantiality has been elucidated. It is the Monistic Essence, [i.e. the real background] of the unreality [of phenomenal existence. This monistic reality however should not be understood in the sense of objective, empirical reality].
nādhikaḥ /	It has not the character of an entity.

[In this case the Non-Substantiality could not have] the character of Dharmata, Ultimate Essence of things existing. It could not be compared then, e.g., to the duḥkhatã, the nature of pain [which depends on a substratum of painful phenomena].
tasmādevamucyate " iyābhāvaḥ śūnyatā /	Therefore it has been said that the unreality of duality is Non-Substantiality.
tasya cābhāvatyābhūtaparikalpe bhāvaḥ / śūnya tetyabhāvasya bhāvalakṣaṇaparigṛhītatvāirmatāsvarūpaṃ paridaupitaṃ /	And the [Monistic Essence], the real background of this unreality, existing in the Constructive Ideation, [i.e. in the objectivizing consciousness or causally dependent aspect of existence] is likewise called Non-Substantiality. And it is in this way that we should understand [the Non-Substantiality] as Ultimate Essence of things existing : For the elements of existence in their unreal, superimposed aspect are comprised by [i.e. depend on] real existence.

In order to show that the absolute unreality, the absolute non-existence [is meant here], it has been said: It is the absolute existence [of the Undifferentiated Monistic Essence, which is the background] of the unreality of duality in the Constructive Ideation.
na hi prāgabhāvapradhvaṃsābhāvau svopādānā adanyatra ṛkhyātuṃ yuktau / anyonyābhāvasyāpyubhayāśritatvādekāśrayatvaṃ na yuktaṃ /	For the antecedent non-existence as well as the subsequent non-existence enevitably require a substratum [on which they depend]. And it is impossible that the reciprocal non-existence could depend upon itself alone, because [in reciprocal non-existence is implied that] two things are mutually dependent.
ato bhāvā " bhāvalakṣaṇopādānāgrāhyagrāhakayoratyantā bhāva eva śūnyatetyetajjñāpitaṃ bhavati /	Therefore it has been taught that the Non-Substantiality is exactly the absolute non-existence (or unreality) of subject and object because in its essence it is the substrate-cause of the unreality of [phenomenal] existence.
yadyabhāvātmikā śūnyatā kathaṃ paramārtha ucyate / paramajñānaviṣayatvādanityatāvan na tu vastutvāt /	If the Non-Substantiality is the essence of [phenomenal] unreality, why is it called "Paramartha", Ultimate Reality? Because it is the object of the paramajñana, the highest Ultimate Wisdom.
api cābhāvasvabhāva'pi na bhavatyevamapi tasya yadabhāvarūpatvaṃ sa ° naiva bhāvo na vābhāvaḥ /	Moreover, this [Ultimate Reality] is not non-existence [or unreality] as such. For (it has been said); That which is the true nature of the unreality of the [duality in the Constructive Ideation] is neither real, nor even unreal.
kathaṃ na bhāva iti / yasmāiyasyābhāvaḥ /	Why is it not real? Because it is the unreality of duality.
° bhāvatve hi na yasyātyantābhāvaḥ syānnābhūtaparikalpadharmatā /	For in case that it should be real [in the sense of empirical reality], Y. duality could not be unreal from the absolute point of view.

yasmāddayābhāvasya bhāvaḥ dayābhāve hi dayābhāvasvabhāvo nābhāvo bhavati /	the unreality of duality. For the unreality of duality is not independent unreality. [Duality is not unreal in consequence of its own nature, but in consequence of the absolute nature].
tena vinā ca iyabhāva eva syādannābhūtaparikalpadharmatā yathānityatā duḥkhatā ca /	If the NonSubstantiality should be unreal [in a phenomenal sense], duality would be real and also in this case [the Non-Substantiality] could not be the Ultimate Essence of the Constructive Ideation, in the same way as the nature of pain and impermanence [is the essence T. 40 of painful and impermanent phenomena].
sattvānāṃ hi viparyāsātsamāropitanitya sukhavastusvarūpaṃ bhāvo'pi na bhavatyabhāvo'pi na bhavati /	It has been said [that the Non-Substantiality is] neither real nor unreal because it is the true nature of the unreality of those [separate] permanent and blissful essences and qualities which are superimposed [on the real component parts of the stream of consciousness, on the ideal world] by those sentient beings [who are deluded as to the real nature of Absolute Truth], on account of their perverted knowledge.

Therefore he says: This is the essence of the Non-Substantiality: It is indeed the true nature. [the background] of phenomenal unreality, of rather it is that [absolute] existence, in which the negation of [separate] phenomenal reality is implied.
tasmādabhūtaparikalpān na pṛthakka¨ kalakṣaṇaṃ //	It is therefore an Essence neither different from nor identical with the Constructive Ideation.
kaḥ pṛthakte sati dharmādanyā dharmateti na yujyate ° /	If it should be different, the dharmata, the Ultimate Essence could not be different from a dharma, an element of existence.

For in that case we would have a regressus ad infinitum : [If a dharma could be at the same time dharmată and a dharma, every time anew] we should have to search for other dharmas [who could be the dharmata of the other ones] and this would be absurd.
yathānityatā duḥkhatā ce ti /	It is the same with the nature of impermanence and the nature of pain.
yathānityatānityebhyo nānyā duḥkhatāpi" duḥkhādevaṃ śūnya tāpi na śūnyādanyeti /	Just like impermanence is not different from things impermanent and the nature of pain not different from painful phenomena so also is the śünyata, the NonSubstantiality not different from things non-substantial.
ekatve sati viśuḍyālambanaṃ na syātsāmānyalakṣaṇaṃ ceti /	If [the Non-Substantiality] should be identical [with the Constructive Ideation], it neither could be the object and support of purification nor the general essence.
viśudhyate'neneti viśuddhirmārgaḥ /	The Path [of Final Deliverance] is purification, because it purifies [the Non-Substantiality from the accidental defiling forces].
dharma svalakṣaṇādananyatvāddharmasvalakṣaṇavanmārgasya nālambanaṃ /	If [the Non-Substantiality] should not be different from the Constructive Ideation it would neither be different from the dharmasvalakṣaṇa the particular essence of the elements of existence, and as such it could not be the object and support of the Path.
ataḥ sāmānyalakṣaṇamapi na yujyate svalakṣaṇādananyatvāt /	And in this case it could Y. not be the sāmānyalakṣaṇa, the general essence, since this would coïncide with the particular essence.

na bhāvasvalakṣaṇamā lambyamānaṃ viśuddhimāvahati/ sarvasattva viśuddhiprasaṅgāt /	It is not the phenomenal world in its particularity, in its separateness, which could be the support-object of purification, for in that case all sentient beings would be "pure", [i.e. delivered from the bonds of phenomenal existence without effort ].
yadyanyānanyatvenāvaktavyaṃ / kathaṃ nirgranthavādo nālambito bhavati /	If [the Ultimate Reality] is not to be defined either as different from or identical with [the Constructive Ideation] why do you not support the doctrine of the nirgranthas? Indeed, if one does.

śūnyatā tu na bhāva iti nāstyaya doṣaḥ /	But since the Non-Substantiality is not an empirical entity, there is no fault in the reasoning here.
evaṃ ca śūnyateyamabhāvalakṣaṇā niḥsvabhāvasvarūpalakṣaṇādayalakṣaṇā ta ttvānyatvavi nirmuktalakṣaṇā ca paridaupitā" //	So this Non-Substantiality has the character of asat, non-being. the character of abhāvasvarüpa, true nature of non-phenomenal existence and the character of the Unique Principle, of the Undifferentiated Monistic Essence. In this manner it has been made clear that [the Non-Substantiality] is beyond the characteristics of identity and difference.
prathamaḥ paricchedaḥ uktaṃ śūnyatālakṣaṇam / paryāya idānaumucyate tathatā bhūtakoṭiścānimittaḥ paramārthakaḥ /	This is the explanation of the Essence of the Non-Substantiality. An explanation of the synonyms follows here: Summarily the synonyms of the Non-Substantiality are: Tathatā, The Absolute Essence; Suchness. Bhūtakoti, The Limit of Reality; The Absolute Point of Existence.
dharma dhātuśca paryāyāḥ śūnyatāyāḥ samāsataḥ //	Paramarthatā, the Absolute, the Ultimate Reality. Dharmadhātu, The Unique Absolute; the Ultimate cause of the elements; Realm of Ideas.

Bhūtakoti therefore is called bhūtaparyanta, "The Extreme Limit of Reality".

And because [in the light of the Monistic Essence of the Absolute] there is no characteristic whatsoever, [even conditioned as well as non-conditioned existence] are exempt from them.
sarvanimittābhāvādanimittaḥ / animittamevānimittaḥ /	[And here the phenomenal and ideal] unreality of alle characteristics is identical with [and dependent upon] the unreality of the characteristics [ascribed to the Non-Substantiality].
āryajñānagocaratvātparamārtha iti paramaṃ lokottaraṃ jñānaṃ tasyārthaḥ paramārthaḥ /	It is Paramarthatā, Ultimate Reality because it is the objectsphere of the wisdom of the Saints.

Or rather, he puts the same question because it has been said that immediately after [the exposition of] the meaning of the synonyms the differentiation should be known.

Now, during the process of defilement and purification there is, besides the Non-Substantiality, nothing which is subject to defilement or purification.
tasmātsaṃkleśaviśuddhikālayoḥ śūnyataiva saṃkliśyate viśuddhata iti pradarśanārthamāha + saṃkliṣṭā ca viśuddhā ca ityasyāḥ prabhedaḥ /	Therefore in order to point out that at the time of defilement and at the time of purification it is only the Non-Substantiality which becomes defiled and purified, he says: Because [the Non-Substantiality] is defiled and purified, there is a differentiation of it.
kadā saṃkliṣṭā" kadā vi malā iti anavagamya pṛcchati kadā saṃkliṣṭā kadā viśuddheti : /	Since he does not know when [the Non-Substantiality] is defiled and when it is pure, stainless, he asks: At what time is it defiled, at what time is it purified?

āśrayāparāvṛttiparāvṛttyapekṣayā saha malena prahoṇavyavasthāpyate /	It has been established that the [Non-Substantiality] is subject to defilement and free from defilement by means of its relation to the "Non-Revulsion" and "Revulsion" of the "Personality".

ata āha kathaṃ vikāra dharmiṇautvādanityā na bhavatīti ° / saṃkliṣṭāvasthātaḥ śūnyatāyā viśuddhyavasthāyāṃ nānyo vikāraḥ /	That is why he asks: How is it possible that [the Non-Substantiality] is not impermanent, if it is endowed with the peculiar characteristic of change? Indeed there is no other change [of the Ultimate Reality] exept [the change] from the phase of defilement to the phase of purity.
tattvato'vasthāyāḥ svabhā "vāntara manāpadyamānāyā āgantukamalāpagamāt /	But the Tattva, the Absolute Truth, such as it exists in itself, does not change into another substance because it becomes free from accidental defilement.

In the same manner [the Non-Substantiality] is in reality pure, both at the time of having accidental defilements and at the time of being liberated therefrom, even without obtaining another substance. It is in this way that even the Non-Substantiality is defiled by accidental obscurations.

vastubhedena ṣoḍaśavidhā /	It becomes sixteenfold by reason of a differentiation of the substratum, [viz.

Therefore he shows that its manifoldness has the nature of the manifoldness of the categories [to which it is applied]. It is not possible to explain its manifoldness in a different manner.
pūrvaṃ tāvaḍoktā vibhāvayitavyaḥ / tatsnehābhiniveśatyā janārthaṃ /	To begin with it should be made clear what is meant by the enjoying subject, in order to be able to renounce the affection for it and the attachment to it.

Therefore the Non-Substantiality of the internal bases of cognition, i.e. the eye etc., is called the NonSubstantiality of the enjoyer.
bhojanaśūnyatā bāhya riti /	The Non-Substantiality of the enjoyed [which is replaced] by the external [bases of cognition].
tāni ca rūpā didharmaparyantāni /	These begin with rūpa, colour, and extend as far as the dharmas, the non-sensuous objects.

And if we say that [the Non-Substantiality of these categories of phenomenal existence is Ultimate Reality, just like it has been apprehended by this knowledge of the Non-Substantiality, the Non-Substantiality of this aspect is the Non-Substantiality of Ultimate Reality.

The real background of this Unreality is [called] the Non-Substantiality as "Monistic Essence" of "phenomenal existence" Why again are these two [aspects of] Non-Substantiality dealt with in the end? In order to point out the Essence of the Non-Substantiality. And why is the Non-Substantiality once more explained? [In order to avoid realism and nihilism], viz.

In the same way we have the Non-Substantiality of Ultimate Reality. This means the unreality, as well as the real background of this unreality, of an individual perceiver of aspects of Ultimate Reality in so far as these are of an imputed, constructed essence.

Immediately after the differentiation [of the Non-Substantiality] its realization has been taught. Hence it is asked now: How is the realization to be known? What is it that is realized here? The nature of defilement by reason of the accidental secondary defiling forces and the nature of essential original purity.
tatra saṃkliṣṭatāsādhana madhikṛtyāha --prathamaḥ paricchedaḥ yadyayaṃ na bhavetkleśo muktāḥ syuḥ sarvadehinaḥ /	With regard to the realization of the nature of defilement he says in this respect: If this defilement should not exist, all mortals would be delivered.

evaṃ śūnyatāyāḥ saṃkliṣṭaprabhedaḥ sādhito bhavati /	So the defilement of the Non-Substantiality has been realized.

ata evāhuḥ muktāḥ syuḥ sarvadehina iti / atra dehina iti tadupādānamevo ktaṃ /	Hence he says: "All mortals would be delivered". For, here by "mortal beings" is meant the causa materialis, the substratecause of that [defilement and purification].

And here the word "Citta", Mind is to be understood in the sense of "Cittadharmatā", the "Absolute Nature", the "Ultimate Essence" of the Mind, for the mind [itself, being the source of discriminating wisdom, is for this reason also] characterized by accidental defilement.
kathaṃ nāliṣṭā na viśuddheti" / kliṣṭaiveti pratiṣedhadaya nāvagamyate /	In what manner is it not non-defiled, nor pure ? Moreover it is defiled because it is made known by reason of the two [kinds of] negation.

According to some, in order to point out the differences [which result] from the Mundane Path and the Transcendental Path.
laukikalokottaramārgaviśeṣārthamityeke/" laukiko" hi mārgaḥ svabhūmimalaiḥ kliṣṭaḥ/	For the Mundane Path is defiled by the stains which belong to its own stage, but not by [the stains which belong to] the lower [stages], since it is the counteragent thereof.
lokottaramārgastu mṛdumadhyā" dibhedādaśuddho'nāsravatvāttu śuddhaḥ /	The Supermundane Path however, although impure in so far as it is differentiated into inferior, intermediate and [highest stages], is pure since it is uninfluenced by defiling agencies.
naivaṃ śūnyateti // na kliṣṭetyuktā /	That is not the case with the Non-Substantiality, [since this is influenced by defiling agencies, in so far as it is applied to the categories of phenomenal existence].

[Hence, the Non-Substantiality applied to them is impure.] Now, if we should assume that the [NonSubstantiality] is not defiled [in so far as the eye and other senseorgans are not defiled], then we must for the same reason maintain that it is not pure.
kuśalaṃ sāsravaṃ hi saṃsāra paryāpannatvānnāliṣṭaṃ / iṣṭavipākatvācca śuddhaṃ /	But they are pure in so far as they strive for [a good, a pure] retribution, [i.e. in so far as they assist in attaining Final Deliverance].

sā hi viṣṭāvasthāyāṃ sakleśeti" na śuddhaiveti" / evaṃ śūnyatāprabhede saṃkleśaviśuddhinirdeśoyaṃ sādhito bhavati /	For this is defiled and non-pure [only] in its defiled condition, [i.e. only in so far as it is seen in its relation to phenomenal existence]. Thus the tenet that there is a differentiation of the Non-Substantiality by reason of defilement and purification has been realized here.

tatra vikalpapratipakṣeṇa svalakṣaṇaḥ /	The Particular Essence in this respect serves as a counteragent of false discrimination.

The Essence of the Differentiation [serves] to remove the indolence of those lazy inert people who are full of all sorts of misconceptions, just because they heard something about the true nature of the NonSubstantiality as well as about the actions [which serve to realize the Non-Substantiality].
