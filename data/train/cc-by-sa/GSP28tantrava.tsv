āmrāyasya kriyārthatvādānarthakyamatadarthānāṃ tasmādanityamucyate	For this reason we conclude that the Arthavāda passage in question is absolutely useless. We now proceed to prove the uselessness of Arthavada passages, as shown by their own meanings and implications.
siddhapramāṇabhāvasya dharme vedasya sarvaśaḥ /	Or, lastly, it may mean that we are not able to ascertain that the whole of the Veda is an authority for Dharma.
yarthavāda mantrāṇāmupayogo 'dhunocyate	The passage We know not, &c., is meant to be taken along with the Injunction of the appointing of the Arsheya priest.
tathā phalābhāvāt	Also because of the absence of results.
yadi tāvadgargatrirātrabrāhmaṇavedānumantraṇajñānakāle vidyamānayoreva mukhaśobhāvājijanmanoḥ saṃkīrtanaṃ na dharmaṃ prati pramāṇyam /	With reference to the GargatrrätraBrāhmana, it is saidThe face of one who knows this brightens up and again, a horse is born for him. Now, if, at the time of knowing the particular Brahmana and Mantra the brightness of the face and the birth of the horse already exist, then a mere ention of these cannot serve any purpose with regard to Dharma.
atha tvavidyamānayostataḥ svārthe 'pi /	On the other hand, if these do not exist at the time, the passages become false even intrinsically by themselves as declaring what does not exist.

And as all learning is meant to capacitate the agent for the perform ance of sacrifices,these, being complete in themselves, exactly like the bathing of the sacrificer at the sacred places, cannot be accepted as theN Injunctions of Results, as will be shown in the first Adhikarana of the third Pada of the Fourth Adhyāya.
paunaruktyāttatra na vicārayitavyamata āha tena phalavidhitvānnirākṛtasyehā nartha kyārthavādatvavicāra iti / stutyarthatāpi cāsatyasya nāstīti vyavasthitameva	It may be urged that as the matter will be fully dealt with in that place, the question should not have been repeated here but then, there is a difference as what is proved in that Adhikarana is that the passages in question are no Injunctions of Results, but mere Arthavadas while what we are declaring now is that the Arthavada passages in question are absolutely useless and as such there is no repetition. Nor can these passages be taken as mere glorifications because as a rule false statements cannot be accepted as constituting proper glorification.
abhāgipratiṣedhāt	Because of the uselessness of others.
trīṇyapi pṛthivyādivacanāni apratiṣedhabhāginamarthaṃ pratiṣedhanti /	But we grant for the sake of argument, that these are Injunctions of Results even then we find that they lead us to believe other actions laid down in the Veda to be useless.
antarikṣe divi ca tāvadaprāptatvātpratiṣedhāviṣayatvam /	, there would be no need of performing the other elaborate actions of the Agnihotra and the Jyotishtma and as such, the Injunctions of these latter would become entirely useless.
ataśca paryudasitavyābhāvānna paryudāsaḥ /	Because of the negativing of that which is not. capable of being negatived.

If the two sentences be said to be a mere description of the natural state of things then they cannot be held to serve any useful purpose with regard to the performance of sacrifices. And as for the first sentence not on the Earthany negativing or excepting of the laying on Earth is not possible, without setting aside the Injunction of the laying itself and this setting aside would render a direct Injunction wholly futile.
bādhe ca vidhyānarthakyam / vika lpe'pi pakṣe bādhaḥ / kāmasaṃyogāccāgnerastyeva pākṣikatvam /	Even if the two sentences be taken as laying down optional alternatives, then, too, there would be a partial setting aside in one case of the direct Injunction. Specially as the Veda itself lays down many alter natives with regard to the laying of fire, as done with a view to different results and as such it is not right to accept Prohibitions for the mere pointing out of optional alternatives.
durbalaśca pratiṣedhaḥ /	And then, this Prohibition, too, would be extremely weak .
pṛthivīparatve sati cayane kalpyatvāt / etadevāsya svayamākulatvam/ vidhyanantarameva hiraṇyaṃ nidhāya ce tavyamiṣṭakābhiragniṃ cinutaetaccākulayet /	When the prohibition is taken with regard to the Earth, then as no such prohibition of the Earth as the place of laying could be possible, unless there were a likelihood of the action of the laying being performed it would be necessary to assume an Injunction of this laying and then as all the places where the fire could be laid, the Earth, the Sky and Heaven,are negatived, by the sentence under “consideration, such negation would lead us to the assumption of an Injunction wholly prohibiting the aforesaid laying and this is what is meant by the selfcontradiction mentioned in the Bhashya. The said prohibition would also contradict other direct Injunctions such, for instance, as the Fire should be laid after the golden plate has been put in, and the Fire is laid upon bricks both of which dis tinctly mention the Earth as the place on which the Fire is to be laid.
prarocanābuddhistu naivotpadyate	Nor is it posible for the sentences to be taken as only meant to attract people, to a certain course of action, and not as a regular injunction.
vidhinā tvekavākyatvātstutyarthatvena vidhīnāṃ syuḥ pūrvapaścodāhṛteṣveva vākyeṣu siddhānte 'bhidhātavye kimarthaṃ vāyavyavākyama panyasyate /	Because of the mention of noneternal objects. In the case of such passages asBabara Pravahani desired and the like, from among all possible significations, the words Babara Pravāhani, &c., cannot be taken as pointing to anything else either anything in connection with sacrifices, or a glorification except and as such a person cannot be said to be eternal this comes to be a mention in the Veda of a transitory object. The mention of such objects, when brought forward and urged against Babara, the son of Pravaz the authority of the Veda as a whole, can be explained in some way or other as has been done above, in Ii.
samānanyāyatvādidamapi tatra tānyapi cehodāhṛtāni draṣṭavyānīti /	Therefore, in the case of such passages, all that we can do is to take no notice of their significations, and to assume particular results to follow from the mere repetition of these.
yadyapyevaṃ tathāpyapūrvodāharaṇamabhiprāyāntaramākāṅkṣati /	to admit of the fact of such texts being read up only for being rejected just as we accept the Arthavada passages as only meant to be disre garded.
tadabhidhīyate /	In the passage in question, however, there is no such implication.
pūrvodāhṛteṣu sarvatra svārthāsatyatvamapyāśa ṅkyate / tatra kaḥ prathamameva tatpratipādanakleśamaṅgīkuryāditi prasiddha svārtha satyatvānāṃ stutidvāraikavākyabhāvena dharmapramāṇaśeṣatvamātrapratipattisau karyārthaṃ vāyavyavākyopanyāsaḥ /	It was proper for the Bhashya to put forward its own view with reference to the same Arthavāda passages that have been cited in the Purvapaksha for what special reason then, does he bring forward a different passage ? In reply to this, some people assert that as the bearing of all Arthavāda passages is the same, it does not make any difference, whether this or that passage be cited in the Purvapaksha or the Siddhanta. the Siddhanta. But though this may be the case, yet the citing of a new example always implies an ulterior motive in the mind of the author and this motive we proceed to explain As regards the passages eited in the Purva paksha, even their literal significations are open to doubt and consequently to begin with them would entail the additional initial effort of proving them to be true and inasmuch as this initial effort would be of no consequence, and as such not very desirable, the Bhashya has cited a passage, which, in its literal signification, is universally recognised to be true whereby it becomes g easier to explain, that such passages are glorifications, to be taken along with the Injunctive passages, and as such come to help in the knowledge of Dharma.
tatra bhāṣyakārāḥ prasiddhenaivai kavākyatvena stutya rthopayogaṃ vadanti /	And to facilitate the matter still further, the author of the Bhashya proceeds to show the use of Arthavadas as glorifications, by means of a passage which is instantly recognised as one to be taken along with and forming part of a direct Injunction.
etāvattvatra prathamaṃ vaktavyam / kimarthaṃ rūpabhaṅgo na balādekavākyatā puruṣārthatvaṃ vā vedasyocyataiti /	But before proceeding further, we have to explain the following difficulty Why is it that the natural form of the Veda is perverted, with a view to establish a forced syntactical connection ? Or if it be declared that we have recourse to this in order to establish a direct relationship of the Veda to human ends how is it that the Veda is said to be for the sake of mans ends? It might be urged that these assumptions are made, because such is found to be a fact, in the case of ordinary human assertions.
yuktaṃ loke vākyārthasya pramāṇāntaragamyatvādanyathāpi kalpanamiha tvatyantātīndriyatvādyathāśrutādoṣadapyanyathātve pauruṣeyatvamāpadyeta /	But, then, the case of these latter is entirely different as what they speak of is cognisable by other ordinary means of cognition and, on the strength of these latter, such farfetched assumptions are admissible whereas in the case of a Vedic passage, treating as it does of supersensuous things, even if the slightest change be made in its original form, it becomes a creation of the human mind and thereby loses the very basis of its authority.
na hyātmānupakāriṇaḥ santamenaṃ buddhipūrvakāriṇaḥ puruṣāḥ prayatne na dhārayeyuḥ / yadyapi ca keṣāṃ cidajñānaṃ bhavettathā pyasmatpūrvātikrāntānekaparīkṣaka pramādakalpanā niṣpramāṇikā /	And certainly, if it did not serve some useful intelligent people of old would not have made such efforts to preserve it and purpose, the hand it down in an unbroken tradition. Though it is just possible that a single man may have erred in his estimate of the usefulness of the Veda yet there is no reason for saying so, with regard to the extremely intelligent enquirers that have gone before us.
tasmādyathāyathā puruṣārthatā bhavati tathātathā bhakkāpirūpaṃ vyākhyāyataiti /	And for this reason, it is only right that we should even break up the natural form of the Veda, in order to make it serviceable to man.
na tvetadyuṛmiva / kutaḥ puruṣādhīnaprāmāṇyaprasaṅgāt /	This explanation, however, does not appear to be quite satisfactory because, if such be the case, then the authoritativeness of the Veda would depend upon man.
yadi hyārānupāto'pyartho'smadādibhirevaṃ kalpyate / yasmādayaṃ prayatnena dhārayāmastasmādasya puṣārthateti /	If we were to assume even such meanings as are not signified by the actual words of the Veda, and if the usefulness of the Veda to man were to rest on the sole authority of the efforts made to present it, then the authority of the Veda would become dependent upon our own efforts.
sarvatra hyevamayaṃ puruṣo vedeti pratyayo naivamayamartha iti /	Specially in the case of each man, the idea that we would have would be that this man knows it thus, and not that such is its meaning.
ato yāvadveda eva puruṣārthatayā sakalamātmānaṃ na pratipādayati tāvadapramāṇam /	Consequently then, though, in the case of particular students, we might infer the fact of their knowing the Veda to be useful to them, yet, as there can be no secure foundation for this notion, the authority of the Veda cannot rest solely upon that fact. Therefore it must be admitted that until the Veda itself does not directly declare itself. P to be serviceable to man, it cannot be accepted as authoritative.
sakalasya tāvadvedasya svādhyāyo'dhyetavya ityadhyayanabhāvanā vidhīyate / tatra kiṃ bhāvayedityapekṣāyāmadhyayanamityāgatamapi puruṣapravarttanāśaktiyuktena vidhāyakenāpuruṣārthasādhyāyāṃ bhāvanāyāṃ pravarttanāśaktiprasaktastadaṃśātantravārtika /	But we can explain the whole of the Veda, its stud culty in the following manner As for the SU is directly enjoined in the sentence Sva dhyayodhyetavyah. The Veda should be duly studied,the sense of which is that we should accomplish something by means of the study of the Veda, And as for what is to be accomplished, though the study itself presents itself as the object, yet, inasmuch as an Injunction, which has the power of persuading people to action cannot but have for its object some thing that is of use to the man, the mere study ceases to be accepted as the object to be accomplished, and becomes mixed up with the instrument or means of the said accomplishment because this instrumental character is quite compatible with its nature, and is the most proximate the sense of the Injunction thus being that the desirable object is to be accomplished by means of the study. What next appears to be the object to be accomplished is the getting up of the mere letters of the Veda, in accordance with the maxim that anything that is capable of being accomplished is the object.
nnirākriyate /	But this, too, in itself, can be of no direct use to man.
tasyāpyapuruṣārthatvāttena kimiti padāvadhāraṇamityapatiṣṭhate tenāpi padārthajñānaṃ tena vākyārthajñānaṃ tena cānuṣṭhānamanuṣṭānena svargādiphalaprāptirityetāvati prāpte nirākāṅkṣī bhavati/	However, this getting up of the letters points. to the knowledge of the words, which in its turn points to the knowledge of the meanings of these words, which last points to the knowledge of the meaning of the sentences composed of those words and this leads to the acting in accordance with the injunctions contained in these sentences, which acting finally leads to the attainment of such desirable results as Heaven and the like. And it is only here that the object to be accomplished being duly ascertained, all the information required in connection with the injunction the Veda should be studied becomes fully supplied.
evaṃ sarvavidhīnāṃ prāk puruṣārthalābhādaparyavasānam/	And thus in the case of all Injunctions, there is no resting until we get at some purpose of man to be accomplished by means of the action therein enjoined.
na ca sahasaiva vidhidarśanātvargādyeva phalaṃ kalpyate / yogyatayā hi yasya yatrānantarabhāvini vyāpāro lakṣyate tadeva tasya kāryamityavadhāryate /	But it is by no means absolutely necessary that, whenever we meet with an Injunction, we must assume such results as Heaven and the like to follow from the action enjoined because when we find that a certain action is actually capable of bringing about the accomplishment of a cer tain result, we conclude this latter to be its effect.
tatra yadi tāvattadanusāreṇaiva kiyatyapyadhvani phalamāsādyate tato nāntarakalpanamarhati /	And hence, whenever we find an action directly capable of bringing about a certain result, even W after the lapse of a certain period of time and space, we cannot rightly assume any other result because the soundness of the Vedic Injunction is established also by means of such results as follow after the lapse of time and not only by those that follow immediately after the Action and as such there is no Apparent Inconsistency in the Injunction that could lead us to the assumption of other results.
yatra tvanantaraṃ dṛṣṭaṃ kāryaṃ na svayaṃ puruṣārtho nāpi pāraṃparyeṇa tamānoti yathā homasyāhavanīyaprāptirbhasmasādbhāvo vā tatra tadatikrameṇa sākṣātkarmaṇa evādṛṣṭakalpanā /	In those cases, however, in which we do not find any particular desir able results following, either directly or indirectly from the Action, as, for instance, the action of the libation reaching the Fire, and being burnt to ashes, we give up the idea of the necessity of the desirable element in the result, and assume a transcendental result to follow from the action itself.
yatra tu vihite phalākāṅkṣiṇi tadanātmaka kārya paraṃparāyāṃ satyāmāntarālikaṃ kiṃ citkratave puruṣārthāya vā codyate tatra tadeva tatsādhanaṃ pūrvasya tu vidhestadupakārārthatayā paryavasānam /	In all cases, however, we have to bear in mind the following In the case of a certain action the threshing of the corn, for instance that is laid down in the Veda, and stands in need of a result, if we find, following from it, a series of actions, not of the nature of a result, and then, in the middle we find laid down something in the shape of the making of the cake that would help the sacrifice, or one the offering itself that would accomplish a desirable result, we conclude these latterly enjoined actions to be the means of the two latter results and the original Injunction of the threshing of the corn is accepted as merely helping in these latter actions and not having its efficiency reaching up to the final accomplishment of the agents desires.
yāni tūttaravidheḥ kāryāṇi prāktāni sādhyasādhanabhāvenācodinatvān nāntarīyakatvena kāṣṭhādīnāmiva jvalanādīni pūrvavihita karmasvavyāpāramātratayā mantavyāni /	And these As for the other actions of pounding, &c., of the corn that are laid down by a subsequent Injunction, these are to be taken as helping in the previous ly enjoined action of threshing, specially as they are its necessary con comitants in the accomplishment of the cake which could not be made unless the corn were pounded after the thereshing,exactly like the burning of the fuel which is a necessary concomitant of the sacrifice actions of pounding, &c., are not held to be the direct means of accomplish ing either the threshing or the cake, because they are not found to have been laid down before, with any reference to the relationship of means and consequences.
yatra tu pāraṃparyajanyaṃ na kiṃ cidantarā vidhīyate tatra sarvāṇi svavyāpārīkṛtya vi dheyasyaiva svayaṃ phalasādhanatā /	is laid down in the middle, it is the directly enjoined action alone which is to be taken as the means of accomplishing the final result, through all the various actions that are laid down in connection with it.
tatra yāni tāvatklapta kalpayiṣyamāpāpuruṣārthasādhana vidhivākyāni tāni tatpratipādanaṃ yāvatsvādhyāyādhyayana vidhinā noyante paratastu phalavatvaṃ jñātameveti na ta prathamādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda /	Thus, then, all the Injunctive passages that lay down the means of accomplishing the directly mentioned, or the assumed, ends of man are includedeven up to the ascertaining of such causal relationships in the Injunction that the Veda should be studied. That is to say, in this case the study is held to be for the purpose of the ascertaining of the said relationships, exactly as the threshing is held to be the means of accomplish ing the cake and the intermediate actions of getting up the words of the the Veda help in the final result, exactly as the pounding, &c., do in making of the cake.. As for the result accruing from the ascertaining of the meaning of Vedic texts, such result has been pointed out by other texts such as That Action alone has a strong influence which is performed with a full know ledge, faith, &c.
yāni tu tatprakaraṇe padyante tānyapi tathaivācaragrahaṇādikrameṇa svārthāvabodhanaṃ yāvadgatāni na sākṣātkratvaṅgaṃ bhavanti /	and as such the former Injunction of Vedic study is not made to extend so far as to the pointing out of its result. And as for the other Injunctions that are found in the same connection, they are also to be taken as serving, by means of the getting up of the verbal text, &c., to help towards the fulfilment of the single result, in the shape of the comprehension of the meanings of Vedic sentences and they cannot be taken as, in any way, directly helping the performance of any sacrifices.
kathamityadṛṣṭopāyāpekṣeṇa kratunā dṛṣṭārthatvādaśarādiṣvanavasajatā tahiddinaṃ karmamātrameva hi prayojanadvāreṇopādīyate nānyat /	Because the performance of sacrifices depends, for its procedure, only upon such means as bring about supersensuous results and as such, they can have no connection with the mere getting up of the Verbal text, which serves only a visible purpose and as such the action of such getting up is accepted only as helping towards the fulfilment of the final result of comprehending the meaning of those texts.
ataḥ pradhānavākyatulyānyaṅgāni bhavanti / tadākyāni tu bāhyatarā eyadhyayanādivat /	Thus, then, we find that the subsidiary sentences or Injunctions of get ting up the Vedic text are similar to the principal sentence or Injunction of the due comprehending of the meaning of the Veda in so much as both are equally related to the human purpose mediately, through an inter vening agency, though the subsidiary Injunctions themselves are one degree further removed.
evaṃ prokṣaṇādivākyānāṃ trīhyādisaṃskāramātraphalāvasitānāṃ tandulapiṣṭapuroḍāśayavadānādibhirvyavahitataraḥ pradhānasaṃbandhaḥ /	In the same manner, the passages speaking of the washing, &c. of the Vrihi, having their sole purpose in the purification of the corn, are found to be very distantly related to the principal sacrifice, through the in tervening agencies of the Rice, the Flour, the Cake, and the Dryavadana Offering, &c.
evamevānārabhyādhītārādupakārakasāmavāyikāṅgavākyāni yojayitavyāni /	Similarly, we may explain the connection with the principal sacrifice of such secondary passages as are not found in the same context, and as such help the sacrifice only indirectly, as well as those that are of direct use.
tatra tvetāvānviśeṣaḥ / yadaprakaraṇasthatvādārā eyaspaśan pradhānamarthaireva saṃbaddhyate /	And the only peculiarity with the relationship of these is that the Principal Action is connected only with what these passages signify, and has nothing to do with the mere words, as the passages are not in the same context.
yāni tvādhānādivākyāni tānyapi phalavatkratvaṅgāhavanīyādisaṃskārapratipādanāvasāyoni dūrasthenaiva phalena nirākāṅkṣīkriyante/	The passages speaking of the laying of the fire and such other ac tions, have their sole use in the preparation of the sacrificial fire, which forms a part of the principal sacrifice leading to certain definite results and as such come to have all their relationships fulfilled by means of the remote Result of the Principal Sacrifice.
etena kāryakartapratipādanahāraṇo paniṣadāṃ nairākāṅkṣacaṃ vyākhyātam / mantranāmadheyayostu svādhikāre yojanā vacyate /	In the same manner the Upanishads have their existence justified by their explaining the real nature of the person that performs the sacrifices. And as for the Mantra and the Names, we shall explain their uses, in their respective places at the end of this Päda and in the fourth Pada.
tena sarveṣāṃ bhāvanāntargatirupapannā /	Thus, then, it is established that all parts of the Veda are included in the Bhavana which is denoted by the direct Vedic Injunctions.
yattvarthavādānāṃ bhāvanāṃśatrayānantaḥ pātitvādagrahaṇamiti /	It has been argued above that the Arthavada passages not being included in any of the three factors of the Bhavana, they cannot be recog nised as parts of the Vedic Injunctions.
tatrābhidhīyate / satyamatiriktaṃ na gṛhyate/	On this point, we offer the fol lowing explanation It is true that the Arthavada is not so recognised apart, by itself but it is actually included in the factors of the Bhavana.
katham / iha hi liṅādiyukteṣu vākyeṣu dve bhāvane gamyete /	How ? X In the following manner In the case of the sentences which contain Injunctive words, there are two kinds of Bhavana that are always compre hendedone consisting of the words, and another of their significations.
śabdātmikā cārthātmikā cātatrārthātmikayā 'rthavādā nāpekṣyante śabdātmikayā tu grahīṣyante /	Those of the latter class do not stand in need of the Arthavada passages but these passages are certainly included in those of the former kind i.e., the Verbal Bhāvanā.
svādhyāyādhyayanavidhinetare sarve vidhāyakāḥ svādhyāyapadopāttaścātmā niyujyate bhāvayediti /	pept The Verbal Bhavana operates in the following manner The Injunc tion of the study of the Veda serves the purpose of employing all other In junctions, as also the self Swa mentioned in the word swadhyāya and this employing or urging is in the formshould think of accomplish ing.
tatra liṅādīnāṃ prayojakakarttṛtvaṃ puruṣaḥ prayojyaḥ tena kimityapekṣāyāṃ puruṣapravarttanamiti saṃbaddhyate/	And in this the Injunctive Word is the nominative of the prompting, and the Person is its objective. of the Person. If, however, the peculiar character of the said Injunction were taken to signify the action of Injunction itselfin the form, should prompt,then the Person himself would become the objective the mean ing being that the Person should be prompted or urged to activity.
yadyapi cācetanatvāliṅādiṣvevaṃvidhaṃ prayojakatvaṃ na saṃbhavati tathāpi puruṣasya prayojyasya prayojakatvānupapattestadgata caitanyadvāreṇa vidhāyakānāṃ prayojakatā/	Though, on account of the inanimate character of the Injunctive, such actions of prompting or urging are not possible, yet, as the Person himself being the object prompted cannot be its nominative, we conclude the power of prompt ing to belong to the Injunctive, through the Intelligence of the Person himself.
yadi caivaṃ na kalpyeta naivaiṣāṃ vidhāyakatvavyapadeśo bhavet /	For if some such assumption were not made, then the Injunctive could never be called the prompter.
atha kanetyapecitepūrvasaṃbandhānubhavāpeceṇa vidhivijñāneneti sambadhyate / kathamiti prāśastyajñānānugṛhīteneti /	Secondly, when the question arisesBy what is it to be accom plished? we have for the replyBy means of a knowledge of the Injunctions, as guided by a previous experience of certain relationships of particular actions with certain definite results. And lastly, to the question How is the prompting to be accomplish ed? we have the answerThrough a knowledge of the excellent charac ter of the particular Action.
kuta etat /	The explanation of all this is very simple.
buddhipūrvakāriṇo hi puruṣā yāvatpraśasto 'yamiti nāvabuddhyante tāvanna pravarttante /	People with any degree of intelligence, when proceeding to do a certain action do not engage them selves in it, until they have ascertained that it is really good and well worth the doing.
tatra vidhivibhaktiravasīdati tāṃ prāśastyajñānamuttamnāti /	It is in this work of attraction that the potency of the Injunction fails but in this it is helped by the cognition of the ex cellence of the Action enjoined as described in the Arthavāda passages.
tacca purupārthātmake phanjāśe sarvasya svayamevānuṣṭhānaṃ bhavatīti prasiddhatvānna vedādutpadyamānamapekṣyate /	And as for the result of the Action, which is always in the shape of something desired by man, the Agent is known to be naturally attached to it and as such that does not stand in need of any description of its excellence, by the Veda.
sādhanetikarttavyatayostvapravṛttapuruṣaniyogācchākhameva prāśastyapratipādanāyākāṅcyate /	But as for the means of attaining the Result, and the method, the excellence of these has to be be pointed out, to the person who has not engaged himself in the Action and this can be done only by means of the Arthavada passages and it is in this that lies the use of these passags.
tatpunaḥ kriyeteti sādhanāpekṣāyāṃ yadi vā phalapadena nivartyeta praśasto 'yaṃ bhūtiphalatvāt / atha vā vidhinaiva sarvadoṣāśaṅkāvinirmuktavedavihitatvāditi /	Now then, when the question arisesBy what means shall I obtain a knowledge of the said excellence ?the answer may, in the first place, be presented by the mention of the particular Result, which leads to the conviction that inasmuch as the Action brings prosperity, it is good and well worth doing or the excellence of the Action may be pointed out by the fact of its being enjoined in the Veda, which is free from all discrepancies or it may be recognised by means of the fact of its being connected with excellent Deities, Materials, and Methods.

ata eva cārthādgamyamānamanyaparatvācchabdānāṃ na prāśastyaṃ prayojanaṃ bhavati/ na hi yadyatpratīyate tattacchātraphalamavasīyate /	For these reasons, the word mentioning the result cannot be rightly accepted as point ing out the excellence of the Action because if that word were so accepted, then no no significance would be attached to the Result mentioned exactly as in the case of the text cited, where the expression, He hears not evil of himself, is explained not as pointing to a result, but only as praising a certain object. For this reason, in the case in question, as the words mentioning the Result have this distinct purpose to serve, even though they in dicate the excellence of the Action, yet no significance can be attached to this idea of the excellence thus obtained.

As for instance, when it is said the former man runs, though this implies the exis tence of the latter man, yet this latter is not accepted as connected with the action that is spoken of with regard to the former. In the same manner, though the excellence of the Action and the consequent attraction of the agent to it are indicated by the word mentioning the Result yet, as this has other functions of its own, it cannot be accepted as having anything to do with the pointing out of the excellence.
anyathānupatyā ceyaṃ tebhyaḥ kalpyeta / sarvapramāṇapratyastamaye cānyathānupapattirbhavati /	Because such indication could be accepted only on the ground of Apparent Inconsistency but we know that it is only when all other means of knowledge have failed that Apparent Inconsistency can be had recourse to and this failure of the other means of knowledge, too, can rightly justify a man to seek the aid of Apparent Incon sistency, with any degree of correctness, only ofter he should have tried his very best to seek for aid from those other means.

evaṃ cana prarocanānyakṛtā karmāṅgam / na cārthavādapadaiḥ prayojanāntaraṃ sādhanīyamityāmnānasāmarthyādubhayorniyamaḥ /	But inasmuch as a mere Arthavada by itself is not capable of being directly related to the Injunc tion as not having the forces of the Injunctive affix, &e., so long as it is not recognised as leading to the accomplishment of the purposes of man, it can only be taken in the literal meaning afforded by the words composing the passage, which consists merely in a description of a certain state of things as they exist and as thus far it is not found to serve any useful purpose, it remains deficient on an important point.
etena pratiṣedhāpekṣita dveṣa siddhyarthaṃ nindāpada saṅgatirvyākhyātā / tatrāpi hi nadveṣāhate vidyānnivarttate /	That, however, which is implied by such descriptionnamely, the excellence of the sacrifice offered to Vāyu indicated by the fact that, the effect being similar to the cause, the sacrifice offered to a swift Deity al ways accomplishes its result quickly, is clearly needed by the Injunction found in close proximity to it and as such the passage in question comes to be recognised as helping in the accomplishment of the mans purpose and hence it is accepted as forming an integral part of the Veda, whose study has been laid down as necessary.
dveṣaścāpraśastapratyayādhīnotpattiḥ /	And this mutual dependence of the Arthavada and the comprehension of excellence is based upon their mutual requirements exactly as in the case of two charioteers, if the horse of one dies, while the others chariot itself is burnt, the horse of this latter is yoked to the former chariot and the or is yoked to the former chariot and the needs of both become supplied.

And as the words of the Arthavada passage cannot do anything else except the declaring of Excellence, we conclude, from the very fact of both the Arthavada and the Injunctive passages cellence and Injunction, respectively i.e., the fact of both appearing in the text of the Veda leads us to some such conclusion as that it is only the performance of such an Action as is enjoined by the Injunctive passages, and rendered attractive or pointed out as excellent by the Arthavāda passages, that can accomplish the desired results to the fullest extent.
nityaṃ ca vidhipratiṣedhayoḥ krameṇa vākyaśeṣāḥ stutinindā nirṇaya hetavo bhavanti /	Thus it is that the Arthavada comes to be taken along with i.e., as forming a part of the Injunction specially as it is always found that it is only the continuations of the Injunctive and Prohibitive passages, res pectively, that become the means of ascertaining the praise or the depre cation of the action concerned.
na hi stutinindenāma vyavasthite nindārūpāsu stutiṣu stutirūpāsvapi ca nindāsu viparyayadarśanāt /	Nor is the character of Praise or of Deprecation altogether exclusive because we often find a praise expressed in the form of a deprecation, and vice versá as will also be declared later on that a deprecatory passage is added not with a view to deprecate that which is evil, but to indirectly praise that which is good and has been laid down as to be performed.

That is to say, in the case of the sentence the water is calm, we have no word expressive of either Praise or Deprecation yet we find, close to it, the sentence He draws the fire either by means of the Vetasa branch, or by the Vaka and on the ground of its proximity to this latter Injunction, we take the former passage to indirectly indicate the praise of the Vētasa and the Vaka, which are laid down in the latter passage.
evaṃ bhāratādivākyāni vyākhyeyāni/	Here we have pure Indication, while if we take the passage to be a praise of the drawing of fire, then it will be a case of IndicativeIndication.

The above explanations apply also to the passages occurring in the Mahābhārata, and Puranas, &c., as with regard to these, we have the express injunction One should recite these before persons of the four castes, which shows that they are the means of accomplishing certain desirable ends and when we proceed to seek for this desirable end, we do not accept the mere recitation of the words as bringing about any result and find that the true result lies in a full comprehension of the causes of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha, as also of their contraries, Adharma, Anartha, Duhkha and Sansara, for the purpose of acquiring those of the former set, and avoiding those of the latter.
tatrāpi tu dānarājamoścadharmādiṣu ke cit sācādvidhayaḥ ke citpunaḥ parakṛtipurākalparūpeṇārthavādāḥ /	And in certain portions of these works,as in the chapters on Dana” Rajadharma and Mokshadharma of the CantiParva of the Mahabharata we meet even with direct Injunctions while in others there are Artha vadas in the two forms of Parakrta those that describe certain actions as having been done by other good men and Purakalpa those describing certain actions as having been done by good men in bygone ages.

And as these descriptions have been inserted with the sole purpose of such praise or deprecation, they need not be necessarily taken as absolutely correct with regard to facts.

Some of these Injunctions in the Mahabharata, &c., are based directly upon the Veda while others are based upon considerations of ordinary pleasure and pain, as experienced in the world. Similarly, among the Arthavādas, too, some are those that appear in the Veda, some are based upon ordinary experience, while there are some that are purely ima ginary, like ordinary poetry.

yathā satrādudavasāyapṛṣṭhaśamanīyena yajeranniti tkkāpratyayasiddhapravṛttyanuvādakatvaṃ vacyate /	And as an instance of such amplification by the Injunctive affix, we have the passagesatradudavasaya prshthaçamaniyena yajeran where the Injunctive affix in yajéran has been explained as only amplifying the performance pointed out by the past participle affix in Udavasaya.

We interpret the Bhashya in the above manner, as meaning the set ting aside of the Injunctive affix, because if the Bhashya had meant that the persuasion is accomplished by means of the Injunctive affix, then it should not have put in the word Uddeça but should have simply said Vidheya.
sūtroktena tu vidhinaikavākyatvaṃ na saṃbhavatītyatikramya aur tantravārtika /	In reality, however, it is not possible for the Arthavada to be taken along with the Injunctive affix, as pointed out in the Sutra and it is this impossibility that is spoken of in the BhashyaThe sentence cannot be construed as that one desirous of prosperity should seize.
vidhividheyasaṃbandhaniṣedhena stutistutyasaṃbandhaṃ vivacitaṃ vadati yatastato bhūtiriti /	The assertion of the Bhashyabecause prosperity follows from it points out the relationship of the praise and the praised, that has been accept ed in reference to the passage in question in preference to that of the Injunctive and the Enjoined, which has been rejected.
itarathā punaḥ śrutapadātirekeṇāpi nipuṇadṛśāṃ bhavatyevāpekṣā /	Thus alone can the fact of the bringing about of prosperity be construed with the passage that is to say, when the fact of the seizing bringing about prosperity has been laid down, the question naturally ariseshow is it that it brings about prosperity ?and in answer to this we have the following Arthavada, which serves to point out the reason for the said potency.

For a sentence is accepted to be complete only when it is not accompanied by such expressions as are significant of a sense more extensive than that afforded by itself and when there happens to be such an expression, people who think over it intelligently find that there is something wanting in it over and above the said expression.
yadā na stutipadānīti / nanvevaṃ satīti /	But when this something is not perceived, the feeling of want or defi ciency ceases and we conclude that there is nothing more really want ing.

It is with all this in view that the Bhashya says When there are no valedictory expressions, the necessary persuasion is accomplished by the In junctive affix itself but when there is a valedictory sentence it is by means of that that the persuasion is fulfilled.

It is often that we meet with such roundabout methods of expression as, for in stance, though the single letter kha would be enough to signify Space, we often make use of longer words, such as Akaça and the like and certainly, we are not taken to task for doing so.

There is yet another explanation that may be given exactly as even though there are many means of performing a sacrifice, yet it is only when it is done in the way pointed out by the Mantra, that it brings about the best results, so, in the same manner, though the Injunctive persua sion could be got at by other means such as the Injunctive affix, &c., yet it is only when it is expressed through the agency of the Valedictory passage, that the Action in question can lead to the best results.

dvayasaṃbhave hi pratyakṣa dekavākyatvādarthavādānugraho yukta iti / nanu satkhapītyanena gatārthatvād nanu nirapekṣādityavaktavyam /	The reply to this is that we have already proved above the useful ness of these valedictory expressions as a matter of fact, they can never be absolutely useless as we have already shown that when the purpose of persuasion is capable of being served by both the Injunctive affix and the valedictory words, inasmuch as the latter is perceptibly capable of being construed with the former, we accept its utility on that score in preference to that of the former. tion may be comprehended by means of the Injunctive sentence independently of the valedictory words.

But there is a difference between the two the former was brought forward with a view to th total rejection of the valedictory words whereas the sense of this second objection is this Though the compound sentence, as a whole, may be taken as signifying Praise, yet it cannot be denied that the first part of it signifies a distinct Injunction and if the expressive potency of the In junctive be once set aside, there being no means of reviving it, it would come to be absolutely incapable of any significance.
athāsya kacidapi śaktirapahiyate tataḥ pratiprasavahetvabhāvāt sarvacāśaktatvaprasaṅga iti/	And to this objection we make the following reply It is true that the first sentence has an injunctive potency but this potency can very well be discarded specially as the fact of its being discarded in one place cannot deprive it of its expressiveness in all cases and conversely, the fact of its having manifested itself in one place does not necessitate its manifestation in every other place.

It is this probable syntactical split, already noticed before, that is again pointed out by means of the present ques tion and answer in the Bhashya.
tasmādekārthyātprarocanayaivātra vidhiriti /	Hence we conclude that, inasmuch the purpose served by both the Injunctive and the Valedictory expres sions is exactly the same, the necessary persuasion should be taken as fulfilled by means of the Praise expressed by the latter.
prarocayamānā anuṣṭhāvṛṇāmiti /	Says the Bhashya Stutiçabdah stuvantah kriyām prarocayamānā anushthatṛnāmupakarishyanti kriyāyāh i.e., the valedictory expressions in praising the Act, tend to make it attractive, and thereby help the actions of the agents.
“ruccarthānāṃ prīyamāṇa” iti sampradānatvaṃ kasmānna bhavati / prarocayateḥ prakṛtyantaratvāditi cenna/	In regard to this, a grammatical difficulty is raised The word anushthatr should have had the Dative affix in accordance with Paninis Sūtra Iiv, as it denotes the persons for whom the actions are made attractive. It cannot be rightly urged that the said Sutra mentions the particular root ruci, while in the sentence in question we have an entirely different root roci.
tatrāpi rucisaṃmbandhānapadbhvāt /	Because, whether the root be ruci or roci, the sense of attractiveness remains the same, and that is the only condition laid down in the Sutra for the application of the Dative.
atha cānuṣṭhātṝṇāmupakariṣyantīti sambandhaḥ /	Nor can it be argued that the Genitive affix is due to the fact of the relationship expressed / being general, and not any special relation such as that of the Dative. Because this cannot be rightly asserted, when we actually have a particular relation that of being attractive distinctly mentioned.
kriyāyā iti pañcamī kriyāto 'pi hi taeva prarocakā iti /	Con sequently we must construe prarocayamānā with kriyāyāḥ and as for the persons to whom these Actions are made attractive, the context naturally points to the performers.
yā'pikasmādityapekṣā kalpyeta sāpi vidhītikarttavyatāviṣayaiva tadanugracārthatvāt / śabdāntaravyapadeśamācaṃ tu bhidyate /	Or, Anushtatṛnam may be taken with upakarishy anti the meaning being that they help the performers, the word kriyayah, in this case, being taken as the Ablativethe meaning being the the valedictory expressions serve to make the action attractive, much more strongly than is done by the Injunctive expression the word kriyā being taken in the sense of Injunction. Or lastly, the word kriyāyāḥ in the Genitive may be taken to mean for the sake of the Action.
na hi vāyavyaśvetālambha ityukte karttavyatā'kartavyatokteḥ prāk praśasto 'praśasta iti vā 'pecyate /	in the Bhashya the word stuvanti, is to be taken as a present participle Plural, Neuter and the meaning is that while eulogising a certain object,viz. the object meant to be laid down, or something related to itthey lay down the Action or something else related to it and this laying down is by means of the Praise hence the authoritative character of the Arthavada passages can be established, only by discarding the Injunctive affixes.
tadanapeścitaṃ ca śrutimātreṇaiva vadanto nārthavādāḥ pratipādayanti /	And in all matters relating to the Veda, the assumption of words is based upon the sole ground of the apparent inconsistency of certain wellrecognised facts and from this assumption of words follows the neces sary accomplishment of the objects. Hence the persuasion could only lead to the assumption of the Injunctive word, and not to that of actual Injunc tion.
na ca dhātvarthena saha kasya citmambandho 'pekṣā vā vidyate /	If there were a setting aside of the Injunctive affix, then there would be no trace left of the fact of the action being for ones own sake or for that of others,a fact that is pointed out by the number, &c., of the nominative agent which in the present case is expressible only by means of the Injunctive affix. P And what It may be argued that what we set aside is only the factor of injunction, and not the ideas of the number, &c.
sarvasya bhāvanāgāmitvāt /	denoted by the Affix.
bhāvanā tu pratyayodvāreṇāpanītā kimapekṣeta /	should h J In the example of the Udavasānīya that has been cited above, the participial affix ktva, while indicating the mere Action, independently of any notions of Injunction or Prohibition, has clearly pointed out literally, attained the position of the Injunction and as such it cannot serve as a proper example.
tasmāttadgatāṃśatrayocchedānna bhṛtiḥ phalaṃ na yāgaḥ karaṇaṃ na veti karttavyatā kā cisyāt / ukta 'pi ca prāśastye kasmādityanapekṣitatvātpraśasto 'yamityetāvanmātre 'vadhṛte praśastatvādityanuccamāne karttavyatābuddinaiva syāt /	Hence has the Bhashya declared The real indicator of the Injunction extends up to the expression desiring prosperity in the sentence vayavyam çoetamalabhēta bhūtikāmah, which shows that the Injunction itself is included in it for if the Bhashya did not mean the Injunction to be so included, it would have declared the meaning of the verbal root only to be the indicator of the Injunction but the mere fact of the meaning of the verbal root embodying an action is not enough to justify us in holding it to be the indicator of Injunction. Consequently, we conclude that it is the Injunctive Affix alone, which, as signifying the Injunction, is held to be the indicator of Injunction. As it is not possible for the Arthavada to be taken along with that which is pointed out by the Injunction which is a particular Action, the Bhashya has added the word Uddeça to the Sutra the expression Vidhyuddēça meaning the indicator of Injunction, which, being in the form of the Injunctive affix, can be taken along with the Artha vāda.
pratyakṣaṃ ca vidhimutsṛjya pāramparyalakṣaṇayārthavādebhyaḥ parigṛhyataityapūrvā vācoyuktiḥ /	The addition of the clause extending up to the word desiring prosperity is made with the purpose of affording an occasion for the Praise, after the Action has been comprehended as bringing about a particular desirable result.
anukto hi sannarthavādādeva vidhiḥ kalpyeta yadyanyathā nopapadyeta /	Dadhna juhoti, there being no desire to seek after any other thing, the Arthavāda passage could not be taken along with it. Reply Though it is so, yet no other means of cognition being applicable, the Arthavada comes to be connected with the Injunction, which is assumed .

And so long as we have these resources at our command, it is not right to have recourse to the uselessly elaborate processes detailed above, by the Opponent.

But we have sailed clear of this objection by putting the sense of the passage in this form One should seize the Cveta, on account of such seizing being good or praiseworthy. This does not give rise to any syntactical split, because that which is enjoined stands in need of Praise for the sake of persuasion and as such, there being no necessity for having recourse to any breaking up of the sentences, the two.
syādetat /	factors viz.
vidhitvamātramavivāyitvāśeṣavivaśayā karttṛsaṃkhyādilābha iti /	Then, again, if the delineation of such distinct relationships were to be marked down as causing a syntactical split, then the pointing out of such factors as the Means, the Result, and the Method as is done by all Injunctive passages would also have to be rejected as giving rise to such a split.
etaccāśakyaṃ yatastadarthamapyupāttaḥ /	It is in connection with these facts that we should take the Bha shya passage This relationship is not what is meant to be expressed.
tasmātpratyaya eva vidhyavidhāyitvādvidhyaddeśaḥ / vidhyarthena tvekavākyatvāsambhavātsūtrātirekeṇoddeśagrahaṇam /	That is to say, the former half of the passage by itself is not meant to be taken as expressing the Injunction with all its accessories because in that case, the Injunction having been duly accomplished by the former half, it is only indirectly, through this Injunction, that the Persuasion, meant by the latter half, could be accomplished and this process being much too complicated, a syntactical split would be inevitable.
kimarthā stutiriti / pūrveṇaiva prarocanāpi siddhetyabhimānātkathaṃ roceteti vidhyanugrahakathanam /	The question in the BhashyaWhat is the use of the Praise ? is put with a view to the fact of the necessary persuasion having been accom plished by means of the former Injunctive passage. And the reply that is givenHow else could there be a persuasion ? is based upon the fact of the Injunction being helped in its potency by the Persuasion expressed in the subsequent Arthavāda.
nanu prāgiti pūrvābhiprāyavivaraṇam /	The sentence in the Bhashya beginning with nanu pragapi explains what has gone before.
na hoti / stutyabhāve tasya śaktidvayamagatyāśroyate na sambhavantyāmapītyetanna tadā bhūtikāmasya vidhiḥ samāpyataityāha /	The passage na hi, &c., means that it is only when there is no direct Praise that the Injunctive passage can be assumed to have the double signification of the Injunction as well as the Praise and this assumption. is not allowable when the Praise can be expressed by another sentence. In that case, if the Arthavada be neglected, the Injunction of the action to be performed by one desirous of prosperity would remain incomplete.
yathā paṭa iti /	The clanse yatha patah has already been explained above.
vidhiśabdena tadā prarocaneti vivṛtaṃ kāryanānātvaṃ vi dhistutyoḥ/	The passageVidhiçabdēna tadā prarocanāserves to point out the manifold purposes served by the Injunction and the Praise.
asti cetprarocayinumapi śaktiḥ kasmādanyadapecyataiti /	The meaning of the objectionnanvēvamapi, &c.is that, when the Injunction itself is capable of persuading, why should it require an Arthavada passage to do this? The reply to this is given by the sentencesatyam, &c.
stutiviṣayopakalpanācca vidherapi stutiprayojanavyapadeśo na hi nirviṣayā stutirupapadyate / arthavādābhāve tvagatyā kevalo 'pigauravamaṅgīkariṣyati / nanu satsvapīti /	That is to say, it is only when there is no valedictory sentence, and not when there is such a direct sentence,that the purpose of the Praise can be held to be served by the Injunctive sentence itself. by the Arthavada alone because the object praised being pointed out by the Injunctive sentence, and no praise being possible without the object that is praised, the Injunctive sentence must also be accepted as serving the purpose of Praising. But it is only when there is no Arthavada passage that we have recourse to the highly complicated process of attribut ing the signification of both Injunction and Praise to the Injunctive sentence exclusively.
pūrvava deva vyākhyeyam /	The sentencenanu satsvapi, &c., is to be explained as before.

idānīṃ ṣaṣṭhīvākyaśeṣasambandhādita evāsya stutimavagacchāmo na svata ityarthaḥ /	and the meaning of this is that we comprehend the Praise not from the Injunctive sentence itself, but from such sources as the Genitive caseending, the supplemen tary sentences in the shape of the Arthavada, and the like.
nanu nirapebādapoti/	Then there is another objection nanu nirapēkshadapi, &c.
yadi kvacidanitikarttavyatā kasya vidheḥ pravarttanaśaktiḥ kasmādanyadapekṣate tena satsvapyanādaraḥ syāt /	and the sense of this objection is this When in certain cases, even in the absence of any mention of the method of the particular Action enjoined, the Injunc tion is accepted to have the capability of urging men to that action, where fore should it stand in need of anything else that may be sought to be expressed by the Arthavāda? And hence, as a matter of fact, even when such Arthavada passages actually exist, it is best to disregard or reject them.
ācāryastu so pahāsamāha yatrāsau kevalaḥ prayujyamāno nirapekṣastatra bhavatu na kaścidvirodhaḥ /	The Author of the Bhashya replies to this objection in a jocular style This may be the case where we have the Injunctive expression appearing alone, by itself, independently of all else because in that case, there would be no contradiction.
iha tu na tatsaṃbhavaḥ sākāṅkṣaḥ padāntarairākṣiptatvāt /	But this is not possible in the case in question be cause in this case, the Injunction is expressed by certain words that stand in need of other factors as Praise and the like.
vākyaṃ hyekamekasyaiva saṃbandhasya vidhāyakaṃ tatra yadi hai/	Any single sentence can be accepted as laying down or expressing only one relationship of a certain thing hence if we make the Injunction indicate the two factors of In junction and Praise, then there would be an inevitable syntactical split.
vidhyuddeśotyāpitānāmevaiṣa hi guṇo bhavatīti prarocanāṃ darśayati /	The sentenceesha hi guno, &c.shows the persuasive force of the Arthavada, as eulogising the factors pointed out by the Injunctive sentence.
tasmādidhinaikavākyatvāttadanugraheṇārthavanto 'rthavādā iti	For these reasons, we conclude that the Arthavada passages have a distinct purpose to serve, as helping the Injunctions, by being taken along with these latter.
aprāptā cānupapattiḥ prayoge hi virovaḥ syācchabdārthastva prayogabhūtastasmadupapadyeta	apart from the accomplishment of certain purposes of man, the Arthavāda passages must be accepted as capable of expressing Praise, and thereby serving the useful purpose of praising an Action which has been laid down as bringing about a certain desirable result, and thereby persuading the man to its performance.
uktadoṣaparihāro 'taḥ param /	The objections that have been urged aboveviz.
śāstradṛṣṭavirodhikā yātrānupapattividhikalpanāyāmuktā tāmasmatpakṣaprāptāṃ manyāmahe /	the contradiction of the Scriptures and facts of ordinary perception, &c.against the assumption of Injunctions in connection with Arthavadas, we do not find to be applicable to our theory. Or the Sutrawhen aprāptām is read as apraptammay mean that we do not find the above explanation of Praise to be open to the said objections.
atha vedaṃ stutivyākhyānaṃ tāmanupapattimaprāptamiti vyākhyeyaṃ yeṣāṃ hakhaḥ pāṭhaḥ /	The signification of such Praises will be exemplified and explained later on e.g., when the water is praised as calm, it is indirectly taken to signify the fact that anything connected with, or proceeding from water, being a source of calmness or peace, would remove the troubles of the sacrificer.
prayoge hyanuṣṭhāne rodanavapotkhananadiṅmoisteyānṛtavādādīnāṃ kalpyamāne virodhaḥ syāt / asmākaṃ tu punarya eṣāṃ śavdānāṃ śrauto'rthaḥ sa naiva vivaścitaḥ /	This Indirect Assertion too is based upon words, the fact of weeping Rodana having been inferred from the mere verbal sound of the word Rudra. And the silver comes to be deprecated on account of the mere assumption that if drops of tears, could be solidified, in as much as they are white, they would be like silver and as such this metal being similar to tears, should not be given or, silver may have been spoken as produced by weeping, on account of the fact of an expenditure of wealth of which silver always forms the principal portion bringing tears to the eyes of persons related to the spendthrift. And thus we find that in some way or other a due comprehension of the Deprecation invariably helps us in getting at the real Prohibition and as such it does not matter, if the Arthavāda is unable to point out the Prohibition directly.
na cādhyāhārādibhirvidhiḥ kiṃ tarhi stutimātraṃ vivaścitam /	Nor can it be urged that there can be no proper Praise or Deprecation indicated by such descriptions as are apparently false. Because the implied Praise or Deprecation is always distinctly comprehended even when the description is false.
na ca tadvirujyate tasmādupapadyeta /	For these reasons we conclude that the fact of the description being false does not in any way affect the question.
atha vā śavdārthastviti vidhāyaka śabdānugrahārthaḥ sannayamarthavādo na svārthānuṣṭhānena saṃbadhyate prayogamaprāpto 'prayogabhūtastasmādupapadyeta /	And this interpretation will supply the substratum of truth in the said Arthavada passage. St But though this interpretation makes the passage appear as a truth ful description, yet it entirely loses its eulogistic character and hence we proceed to explain the passage in such a way as to represent it as truthful, and at the same time, accomplishing its appointed purpose of Praising. On the strength of the Mantras, Arthavadas, Purāṇas, and Itihāsas, we accept the fact of there being a Creation and a Dissolution of the Universe.
trayo'tra pāṭhāḥ /	Similarly too, in the case of the passage“ Dēvā vai dēvayajanam, &c.
aprāptāṃ cānupapattimityatra manyāmahaiti vākyaśeṣaḥ /	And it is as helping to remove this bewilderment that the Aditi sacrifice is praised by means of the said Arthavada passage and the bewilderment is removed on account of there being an interval of time for ascertaining the real character of the subject on which the man is bewildered.
aprāptaṃ cānupapattimityaparasta trāmākhyānamityadhyāhāraḥ / aprāptā cānupapattirityaparastatrāsmatpaśe vijñeyeti	That is to say, during the time that the man is going through the performance of the wellpractised primary actions in connection with the Prāyaṇīya, he gets time to recollect his wits about the Actions that are to come next about which there is generally a confusion in the minds of the performers. Other wise if the said actions were not performed, and there were no interim between the two Primary Actions, the agent would not have time to concentrate his mind upon what he would have to do next.
rūpātprāyāt	The indirect signification is based upon form, and upon the character of the greater part.

In ordinary life, whenever something has got to be done, what the person does is to form a determination in his mind, and then to express it in words or speech, and then to do it and as such even though the Mind and the Speech are very closely related to the Action to be performed, yet they are spoken of as of much less significance than gold, because they have the character of the thief and the liar respectively.
vidhiparātu stutyarthā jāyate tadupapādanasya dṛṣṭārthatvāt /	Because of the greatness of distance. occurs The ArthavadaDuring the day the smoke only is perceived in support of the declaration that During the day, the Fire goes away to the Sun.
yathā vakṣyati nacedanyaṃ prakalpayetpraklṛptāvarthavādaḥ syāditi	And it is this Injunction that can be taken as eulogised by the Arthavada in question because the Injunction serves to set aside, in this case, the general rule that the mantra is to be employed in accordance with the implications of the words composing it and as such the Injunction being one of intermixed implications, it comes to be supported by the said Praise.
svyaparādhātkartuca putradarśanam	Dok Sutra . Through the failings of women, the son is often found to belong to the man.

tatpraśaṃsārthamuktamabrāhmaṇo'pi brāhmaṇo bhavati pravarānumantraṇeneti /	as a praise of this recounting of the Pravaras, we have the declaration that even a nonBrāhmaṇa becomes a Brāhmaṇa by this recount ing.
tatra prasiddhabrāhmaṇatvānāmeva brāhmaṇyalābho niṣprayojana iti tadupapatyarthamuktaṃ na caitaddidma iti /	Against this some people raise the following question In the case of those whose Brahmanical character is wellknown, the acquisition of the said Brahmanahood would be useless and as such the recounting of the Pravaras cannot be necessary for wellrecognised Brāhmaṇas.” It is in anticipation of this question that we have the declarationWe Brāhmaṇas.
jñāyamāne tvajñānavacanaṃ durjñānatvāt / yatsukhenājñānaṃ tadajñānameva /	The mention of know not whether we are Brāhmaṇas or non because the known as the unknown implies that it is hard to be known that which cannot be known easily is as good as unknown and certainly, the fact of any person being a Brāhmaṇa is extremely difficult to ascertain, on account of the failings of the woman.
satyapi ca khyaparādhe yadi mātureva kṣetriṇo vā putraḥ syāttatastayoḥ prasidvṛjātitvānnaiva darjñānatā bhavet /	But even in the case of the womans failings, if the son always belonged to the mother or to her master, the caste of these two being always well known, there would be no difficulty in ascertaining the caste of the son the caste of the Parents also being ascertained by that of the grandparents, and so on and on, the caste of all the ancestors from the very beginning of time, could be easily ascertained.
yatastu mātā bhastrā pituḥ putra iti smartṝṇāṃ darśanam /	But we find such declarations in the Smrtis as The mother is only a leathern bag, the son belongs to the father and as in the case of the woman having been led astray, it is not easily ascertained who the actual father is,and it being quite possible for him to belong to a caste other than that of the woman,the offspring, in this case, would be one of an uncertain, or even a mixed caste.
vede 'pi cāpramattā rakṣata tantumena miti jātivicchedadarśanaṃ tryaparādhakarttṛputranimittamevopapadyate/	In the Veda too, we read one should carefully guard tms thread of caste, which shows that the caste is liable to be lost and as such this passage could be explicable only if the caste of the offspring be accepted to be regulated by that of the man.
anyathā hyaparirakṣamāṇe 'pi naiva svajātitantu vi cchedo bhavet /	Because if the caste were not liable to such changes, would remain intact, even when not guarded and as such there word be no use of the Vedic Injunction just quoted.
tenāsti praśaṃsāvakāśaṃ iti / nirūḍhabrāhmaṇya pravarasaṅkīrttanāttatprabhavo 'yamiti jñānādbrāhmaṇaḥ kṛto bhavatīti stutiḥ	C Thus we find that there is an occasion, or use, for the said Praise of the recounting of ones Pravaras the meaning of the Praise being that a re counting of the Pravaras or Ancestors of universally recognised Brāhmana hood shows that the person so recounting is a descendant of such great Brāhmaṇas and thereby he himself comes to be recognised as a true Brahmana.

The form äkälika signifying that which has its beginning and end at the same time is in accordance with Paninis Sutra äkälikadadyanta vacane . Some people read Akälika and in that case the word means that which does not take time in its appearance. The word kala =remoteness of time kālika that which appears at a remote point of time kāla + than and hence that which is not so is akālika.

phalasya karmaniṣpattesteṣāṃ lokavatparimāṇataḥ phalaviśeṣaḥ syāt	The result being accomplished by means of Actions, there would be a difference in the results in accordance with the measure, or extent of the Actions, as in the ordinary world.
taccaitat samānasvargādiphaleṣvagnihotrādiṣūpayocyataityupanyastaṃ sādhanānurūpatvātsādhyānām /	The assertion made in the Sutra would be of use in the consideration of such sacrifices as the Agnihotra and the like, all of which lead to the same result, in the shape of the attainment of Heaven.
sarve hi kāmāḥ pūrṇātyāvāpyamānāḥ stokastokāḥ prāpyante tatra phalabhūmārthinaḥ karmāntaravidhirarthavān bhaviṣyatīti sthite codyate /	All effects being similar to the cause, all the results that would follow from the mere Purnāhuti, would be in small measures. And hence for one who would want to obtain the results in great measures, the Veda lays down other Actions such as the Agnihotra and the like and hence the Injunctions of the Actions cannot be said to be useless.

For as a matter of fact, there is no difference between the Heaven as attained by means of the Agnihotra, and that reached by the Jyotishtoma nor in such a transcendental matter, can we have any functioning of Inference and as such we cannot admit of any difference between the result as obtained by means of the Purnāhuti and the same as acquired by means of certain other sacrifices.
sāmarthyādevedaṃ siddhama/	To this we make the following reply The specification that we have assumed is based upon the strength of the Injunction itself.
yadi hyalpānmahataśca karmaṇaḥ samaṃ phalaṃ jāyeta tato'kke cenmadhu vindetetyanenaiva nyāyenālapena siddhe mahati na kaścitpravarttate /	That is to say, if the result o obtained by means of the simpler Action were exactly equal to that obtained by the more elaborate Action, then, in that case, the desired result having been obtained by means of the former, no person would ever be inclined to the more elaborate and difficult one as says the proverb If one can find the honey in his own house, why should he go to the distant mountain for it? And hence the Injunction of the elaborate Action would lose all its efficiency which only lies in urging people to Action.
tatra vidhiśaktivādhaḥ syāta vita śaktistu san ardhādvā kalpanaikadeśatvāditi vidhireva phalādhikyamaṅgīkaroti /	But as a matter of fact, the efficiency of the Injunction can never be set aside and as such the very Injunction of the elabo rate Action points to the fact of its results being greater than that of the simpler Action,as is explained under the Sutra Iiv.
ato yathā viśvajidādau phalanadbhāvaḥ pramāṇavānevamiha tadviśeṣa iti /	Conse quently as the assumption of the particular result of the Viçvajit sacrifice m is accepted as authoritative, so also is the differentiation of the measure or quality of the result following from the Purnahuti as differing from the same as obtained by means of other Actions.
yathaiva kramāmnātānāmaṅgāṅgināṃ prathamasya prathamaṃ dvitīyasya dvitīyamiti viniyogavyavasthā tathaiva karmagocare 'paya karmaṇaḥ parimāṇasāmānyena phalagocare 'lpamevopatiṣṭhate / madhyamasya madhyamaṃ mahato mahaditi sthānameva viniyojakam/	And when of two actions, one is greater than the other, even though no difference in their results is directly mentioned, yet there must always be a differentiation of the extent of the results, based upon their respective positions. That is to say, in a case where the subsidiaries are mentioned in the same order as the Primary, that which is mentioned first is performed with the first Primary, and so on and exactly in the same manner, in the case of Actions, when the smaller Action is performed, the result that appears in its connection is always of the same character .e., small and so on with the great Action, it is only a great result that appears and thus we find the results differentiated on the ground of their respective positions.
smaraṇamapyevameva /	We also meet with direct scriptural declarations that support such differentiation.
cāturmāsyasomeṣu ca phalārthavādo yadāgnihotraṃ juddotyatha daśa gṛhamedhina āpnotyekayā rātriyetyārabhya nyanāgnihotradaśasaṃvatsaraprayogādibhirekadarśapūrṇamāsādiprayogāvāpnivacanaṃ karmālapatvamahattvakṛtaṃ phalabhedaṃ darśayati	For instance, with reference to the Caturmāsga Homa, we have the following Arthavada with regard to its result When one performs the Agnihotra, he obtains a result ten times that of the household sacrifice, in a single night By the due performance of the smaller Agnihotra for ten years, the person obtains the result equal to that of a single performance of the Darça Purnamāsa and this clearly shows that the smallness or greatness of the Action makes the result also small or great respectively.
tantravārtika /	Sutra . What has been said above applies to the last two Sutras of the Purvapaksha.
vidhirvā syādapūrvatvādvādamāvaṃ hyanarthakam evamānārthakyopākhyānādipratiyogidhvarthavādeṣu vyākhyāteṣu idānīṃ vidhipratiyogino vicāryante /	And the prohibition of the laying in the sky or in the Heaven may be taken as the statement of a bare fact, laid down with a view to support the prohibition of the bare ground. The meaning of the passage would thus be that just as the laying of the fire is known to be impossible in the Sky or in Heaven, so also is it on the bare ground without a plate of gold,this being the praise of the use of the golden plate. As for the mention of noneternal things in the Veda, this has already been explained under Sutra Ii.

Those Arthavadas that contained mere descriptions of facts having been explained above, we now proceed to consider those that appear in the form of Injunctions. And with regard to these, the following are the grounds of doubt In the former Adhikarana it has been shown that as the Arthavadas serve no purpose directly by themselves, they have to be taken in the indirect sense of Praise.
ato neha prastotavyaḥ /	But in that case, even the Praise would be as good as useless.
anena gatārthatvāt tatraivaiṣa paryanuyogo yujyate na tvidaṃ punaruktamiti / satyamevaṃ yadi tu tatkāla pratīkṣaṇātkiṃ citparihārāntaraṃ svabhyate 'tastatrāncicchema/	As for the factor of Injunction, however, it cannot be got at from any other source while it has been already shown above that Persuasion which is the avowed object of Arthavadas can be got at through the indications of the Injunctions themselves. And again, in all cases, the In junction is the primary, and the Praise the secondary, factor consequently, when a certain assertion can be taken as related to the primary factor, it must be taken as such and not as related to the secondary and it is only when the indication of the Injunction has been fully accomplished that there can be any use for the Arthavāda.
atrāpara vadanti tena phalavidhinvanirākaraṇamātramiha tvarthavādanāya tvarthavādaḥ syāditi tatra vakṣyati tadvidhitvanirākaraṇamātraparameva praṣṭavyam /	And it is while the Injunction is being comprehended, that all the factors of the Bhavana present themselves specially so the factor of the Result, as it is the first and the most important factor in the Bhavana, and as such the first to be com prehended, in the indication of the Injunction.
yatastena phala vidhitvātpracyā vitānā mānarthakyaprasaktī pūrvādhikaraṇenaiva stutyarthatā sādhitā/ tathā ca darśitaṃ śobhate 'sya mukhamityādiṣu /	It is with a view to these facts that the Purvapaksha in the Sutra speaks of its laying down something not known before, and hence it is in comparison with this that it declares the mere expression of Praise to be useless. At the very outset, of the discussion, however, the following objection is raised against the Adhikarana as a whole We have a consideration of such Injunctions and Arthavadas of Results, later on, under the Sutras IVii et seq and as such it is not proper to introduce the same dis cussion, in this place.
ke citpunarāḥ /	.
yuktaṃ vāyurvai kṣepiṣṭhetyādīnāṃ prathamādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda / stutitvam / ūrjā 'varudhyā iti punaryathā phalavidhitvātpracyāvyate tathaiva visaṃvādana stutitvādapoti kāmaṃ vidhirbhavatu yena kālāntarabhāvitvena kathaṃ cihnisaṃvādo nivarttataityārambhaḥ /	To this, some people make the following reply As the discus sion that is repeated in the Fourth Adhyaya is introduced here for the first time, the above objection should be raised with reference to that Adhyaya and not to this. This may be true enough but if by postponing the discussion till the Fourth Adhyaya, we can procure a better reply to the objections against Arthavadas, it is only right that we should seek for it there. Inasmuch as, however, it was equally reasonable for that same reply to have been given on the present occasion, there could not be much harm in its being put for ward here.
tadapyayuktam /	.
api ca vede vyaktamasaṃvāda iti hyatyuccaya heturapunaruktaḥ syāt/ adhikaraṇaśarīraṃtu tadeva /	Others reply to the said objection as follows It is only the denial of the fact of the passage cited being an Injunction of Result that is explained in the Fourth Adhyaya, whereas in the present Adhikarana, it is the character of the Arthavada that is denied in the Purvapaksha because the clause it would be an Arthavada in the Sūtra IViiimust be taken as denying the fact of its being an Injunction.
visaṃvādo'pi ca guṇavāda svityanena na kaścidaparihṛtaḥ / punarapi ca tāvanmāmevottaraṃ bhaviṣyati /	S and put he But even this explanation is not quite satisfactory because even though the collective argument, that there is a clear disagreement with the Veda, may be a new one, a and as such, in this much, there may be no repetition, yet the bodies of the Adhikaranas remain the same. .
tasmādvidhirvā syāditya viśeṣopādānāccaturthe ca phalaśrutigrahaṇādihāśeṣadravyaguṇakriyā dividhisarūpāstatra phalavidhisarūpā evodāharaṇamityapare /	With a view to all this, some people offer the following explana tion The present Adhikarana, in its Purvapaksha, speaks of Injunc tions in general, without any specifications while in the Fourth Adhyaya, we have the expression Declaration of the Result Phalaçrutih and hence the passages considered in the present Adhikaraṇa are such of the Arthavadas as have the form of the Injunction of all such factors as the Substance, Property, Action and the like while those treated of in the Fourth Adhyaya are only those that have the form of the Injunction of the Result only.
tathā ca vidhiśvānarthakaḥ kva citprakaraṇe ca sambhavanniti cāpsuyonirvā aśvo'bhujo vetaso yo vidagdha iti codāhiyate / anyathā phalavidhimātropanyāse nadasaṃbaddhameva syāt /	For instance, Sutras and of this Pada, are found to refer to such instances as The Horse has its origin in the water, and the Cane also has its origin in the water, and the like which treat of the mere forms, &c., of Substances and if the present Adhikarana also referred only to such Arthavādas as have the form of an Injunction of Result, the citing of the said passage would be entirely irrelevant.
icāpi tasya tāvadviśeṣaviṣayatvādidamagatārthaṃ bhavet /	he But though it may be so, yet in that case the subject matter of the Adhikaraṇa in the Fourth Adhyāya would be only a particular phase of that of the present Adhikarana and so would be included in it and as such, the repetition would remain unexplained.
atra dravyādividhīneva tatra phala vidhīneva bhāṣyakārodāharaṇamatantrīkṛtyodāharaṇāntaraṃ dātavyamiti /	Consequently some people dis regard the examples cited in the Bhashya and set about citing other in stances, with the restriction that under the present Adhikarana they cite only those Arthavādas that have the forms of the Injunctions of the Sub stance, &c., while under that in the Fourth Adhyāya they cite those that have the form of the Injunction of Results.
kimadhikaraṇadvayamavagyāravdhavyaṃ yenaivamudāharaṇavyavasthāśrīyate na cudāharaṇabhedādadhikaraṇaṃ bhidyate / mā bhūdyathā vyavasthite 'pi khādirai/	But upon this, we have to make the following observations Is it abso lutely necessary to have two Adhikaraṇas that we should put this restriction upon the examples to be cited? Then again, as a matter of fact, a mere difference in the examples cited does not make the Adhikaranas necessarily distinct because in that case, there would be no repetition in a case where certain discussions, having been carried on with regard to the sacrificial post as made of the Khadira wood, should be repeated again with the sole difference that in the latter case the post as made of the Udumbara wood would be cited as the instance.
nyāyaviṣayatvena tvadhikaraṇānāṃ tadbheda evāpaunaruktye hetuḥ/	As a matter of fact, the subject matter of Adhikaranas being, not any particular examples, but certain rules and arguments in support of the rules, it is only when there is a difference in the rules treat ed of in the two Adhikaranas that these can be accepted as distinct.
ataśca na punaruktatā mahāndoṣa ityeva vaktavyam /	And hence what we should say in reply to the aforesaid objection is that such repetition is not very objectionable. B Or, we may justify the two Adhikaranas on the following four grounds .
atha vaikasyaiva nyāyasya va ci kaścidaṃśaḥ śodhyata iti punarārambhaḥ /	One and the same rule has one part of it discussed under the pre sent Adhikarana, and another part in that of Adhyāya IV.
spaṣṭaṃ vā viṣayanānātvamevaṃ varṇanīyam /	. The subjectmatter of the the two Adhikaranas may also be explain ed to be entirely different.
sarvavidhisarūpāṇāṃ kevalaṃ vidhitvanirākaraṇenārthavādatvamiha siddham/	What is done under the present Adhikaraṇa is that all Arthavada passages having the form of Injunctions are shown to be Arthavadas, and not real Injunctions.
yastu caturthe punarārambhaḥ so 'rthavādakalpite vidhau phalākāṅkṣā velāyāmanyārthopāttamapi ṛtuprayogavacanātadeva saṃnihitataraṃ klṛptasaṃbandhasya ca viśeṣamācaṃ sukaram / ita rathā saṃbandhastadviśeṣaścopakārakatvaṃ kalpanīyamiti rātrisatrapratiṣṭhādivatphalavidhitvamapīti pūrvapakṣābhiprāyaḥ /	While under the Adhikarana in Adh yaya IV, the purport of the Purvapaksha is this When an Injunction has been pointed out by the Arthavada, it stands in need of a certain result for the sake of which it would lay down an Action even though the result that appears in the Arthavada is mentioned with another osten sible purpose that of Praising, yet this result is found to be related to it more closely than any other declarations of the procedure of sacrifices and when such relationship has been once ascertained, a specification of the relationship becomes a compartively easy matter. Otherwise we would have to assume the Relationship itself as well as its specific form and hence we conclude that just as the Injunction of the Ratrisatra sacrifice is one that enjoins the particular resultthe obtaining of fame, so too, the passage speaking of the Juhu made up of leaves cannot but be taken as an Injunction of the particular resultthe not hearing of any vil report with reference to ones self.
kathaṃ citpra yojanāntare labhyamāne naikasyāne kārthatā yuktā tasmādarthavādatvameveti siddhāntaḥ /	And the Siddhanta arrived at is that when it is possible for the passage to be taken in the light of another purpose i.e., of Praising, it is not right to attribute to it two purposes that of enjoining the Result, and Pruising and as such the passage in question must be taken as a pure Arthavada.
etena nivatāvadhikaraṇāni vyākhyātāni /	The same process may be employed in differentating the present Adhi karana from those dealing with Nivita, &c.
atha vai/dumbarādhikaraṇapūrvapacaṃ kṛtvā citāstāḥ pratyetavyāḥ / vidhitvābhyupagamena hi kasya śeṣaḥ kratoḥ puruṣasya vetyādi vicāryeha siddhenārthavādatvenopasaṃhāraḥ / tathā parakṛtipurākalpayoḥ kiṃ tadgotrāṇāmuta sarvapuṃmāmiti cintitam /	Or, these latter may be taken as consisting of some considerations and argumentations with reference to certain supposed objections and questions based upon the Purvapaksha of the AudumbaraAdhikarana the present one as in these a question is raised as to whether the Arthavāda, that is accepted to be an Injunction, refers to the Agent or to the Sacrifice and then the conclusion arrived at is that it is a pure Arthavada. So also in the case of the Adhikurauas on Parakrti and Purakalpa as explained in Adhyāya VI, a fresh question is raised as to whether the Action, the eating of masha fi. that is mentioned in the Veda as having been done by a great man of old, is to be done only by the descendants of that great man, or by all men and it is this extra question that is treated of in the Adhikaraṇa in Adhyaya VI.
evamūhabāghaprasaṅgena navamadaśamagatā cintā tatsidvisatre'nuguṇavāda nimittamātrakathanam/	The discussions with regard to Üha and Badha, as contained in Adhyāyas IX and X, are also of a similar character i.e., dealing with extra questions.
atha vā phalavidhāveva yatra bhedena stutiphalapadāni bhavanti tadihodāharaṇam/	points out the several grounds for accepting a Word in its secondary or indirect signification. And as such in none of these do we find any use less repetition.
yathā caivorgudumbara ūrkapaśava ityetaireva stutiḥ /	.
ūrjāvaruddhyā ityanena phalamiti / yatra punastāvanmātreṇaiva phalaṃ vā stutirvā vaktavyeti bhavati te caturthaiti / athavā tatra parārthatvāditi hetuvyapadeśātprasiddhena ca hetunā vyavahārādye vijñātapārārthyāstaudāharaṇaṃ yathā yasya parṇamayī juhūriti /	Or, the difference between this Adhikarana and that in Adhyaya IV may be explained on the ground that the present Adhikarana treats of only such passages as have the form of the Injunctions of Results, in which the factor that expresses the Praise is distinct from that which mentions the Result as for instance, the passage cited in the Bhashya. The sentence, The udumbara is powerful and so also are the animals, which signifies Praise, is distinct from the sentence For the increase of power appearing at the close of the passage which points out the Result that follows when the sacrificial post is made of the Udumbara wood while in the Fourth Adhyaya, the discussion is with reference to those cases, in which the same sentence may be taken either as Praise or as a mention of the Result.
hyavaśyaṃ juṅkanuvādena parṇamayītvaṃ vidhātavyaṃ svātantreṇa phalasaṃbandhāśaktaḥ /	In this case it is necessary that the fact of being made of leaves should be distinctly mentioned with reference to the Juhu as the former is incapable by itself of having any independent.
sarvatra hi guṇaḥ phalāya codyamānaḥ kaṃ cidāśrayamapeśate / na ca prakaraṇamantareṇāśrayaprāptiḥ /	relation with the result. It is a general rule that whenever a certain property or qualification is laid down, with special reference to a particular result, it stands in need of a proper receptacle or substratum for itself we cannot get hold of any such receptacle, apart from the context in which the said passage occurs.
tadiha yadi parṇamaprathamādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda / yotvena phalaṃ bhāvayediti vacanaṃ vyajyeta kimāśritenetyapekṣāyāṃ kiṃ saṃbaddhyatām /	And hence, if the passage one whose Juhu is made of leaves never hears any evil spoken of himself be taken to imply the injunctionthat one should think of obtaining the said result by means of the particular property of leafiness,the question naturally arises wherein is this property to exist as the mere abstract property by itself can be of no use ? What is the object which, having the property of leafiness, would accomplish the said result? It cannot be the Juhu because that would lead to a split in the sentence and until the Action has been found in which the Juhu is to be used the Juhu itself is not an accomplished fully comprehended object and as such cannot be taken as bringing about any results nor is there any authority in the sentence itself for con.
juhūriti cenna /	necting the Juhu with any action.
tasmādanirvahaṇādetadvacanavyaktiparityāgenetarāyaṇam /	And thus not having all the necessary factors fulfilled, if we accept not the aforesaid construction or explanation of the sentence we are forced to have recourse to another explanation or construction.
tatra ca juhvā juhotītyasyāḥ prakaraṇe nirjñānaprayojanātvādavihitajātiviśeṣāyāstadākāṅkṣāyāṃ satyāṃ yāvadevaparṇatvajātirupanītā tāvaḍhavijñāta prayojanāvasthatvādaṅgatāṃ pratipadyate /	We find that the said sentence occurs in the same context as the sentenceone pours the libations by means of the Juhu and when we come across this sentence, it becomes necessary for us to know the kind of the Juhu that is to be employed but the sentence itself does not afford us any information on this head and this want of information is found to continue until the men tion of the fact of its being made of leaves and as until this information is obtained, the use of the former sentence Pours libations by means of the Juhu is not fully comprehended, the latter sentence declaring the fact of the Juhu being made of leaves comes to be recognised as subsidiary to the former declaring the fact of the libations being poured by means of the Juhu made of leaves.
tataśca nirākāṅkṣībhūtāyāstasminneva vākye phalakalpanā nimittaṃ nāstīti yuktamarthavādatvam /	Thus then, all the information that is wanted in connection with the Juhu having been obtained in this ver sentence, there is no reason for the assumption of a result. And as such it is only proper that the sentence should be taken as an Arthavada.
iha punarvaikṛtapaśuprakaraṇe śrūyamāmaudumbaratvamuḍhāhiyate / na ca tasya prasiddhaṃ pārārthyaṃ yena caturthādhikaraṇaviṣayatā bhavet /	Such is the upshot of the Adhikarana in Adh. IV. In the present Adhikarana, on the other hand, we have for our example, the declaration of the fact of the sacrificial post being made of the Udumbara wood, which is met with in the context treating of the animal to be sacrificed at the subsidiary sacrifice and the fact of this declaration being for anothers purpose is not fully recognised and as such this could not form the subject of the Adhikarana in the Fourth Adhyaya.
atra hi na tāvadaprāpte yūpe jātividhānaṃ śakyam/ tatprāptiścedavaśyaṃ klṛptopakāra prakṛtakhādiratvādinaiva nirākāṅkṣaṇa bhavitavyam / tatkuto jātyantarasya tādarthyena vidhirataḥ phale vidhānam /	Specially because, in the present case, unless the post has been already recognised from other sources, it is not possible to have any declaration of its character and the recognition of the post is accepted as fulfilled by means of the sentence treating of the Primary Sacrifice, which speaks of the post as made of the Khadira wood and as such all the information even that of kind or material, that is wanted with regard to the post, having been obtained by means of this passage itself, there is no use for any injunction of another material the Udumbara wood for it and conse quently the sentence speaking of the post as being made of the Udumbara wood is taken by the Purvapaksha as only an injunction of the Result attainment of power.
yāpi cāśrayāpekṣā sāpi prākṛtakarmasambandhicodaka prāptayapagrahaṇānnivarttata itya vighātaḥ /	As for the information with regard to the substratum of the property of being made of Udumbara wood, this too is supplied by the mention of the post, in the sentence enjoining the Primary Sacrifice and as such this too does not affect the former conclu sion.
tena prāgeva pārārthyātphala sambandhaprasaktiravaṇyaṃ nyāyāntareṇa nirākarttavyetyetada dhikaraṇārambhaḥ /	Thus then, we find that, prior to the ascertainment of the sentence to being for anothers purpose, it is absolutely necessary to connect the action therein spoken of with a certain definite result, this connection being ascertained by means of other arguments than those based upon the fact of a sentence being for anothers purpose, as done in Adh.
idamapara matam / audumbara k juhā divākyaṃ cobhayamubhayatrodāharaṇam /	IV. There is yet another theory with regard to these two Adhikaranas Both the sentencesthe one dealing with the fact of the post being made of the Udumbara wood, as well as that speaking of the Juhu being made of leaves can serve as examples, in both Adhikarauas the present as well as the one in Adh. IV.
sādhyasādhanasambandhastāvaddayorapi yogyatvenopāttayoravakalpate nānyathā /	And inasmuch as two different factors of the Bhāvanā are treated of in the two Adhikaranas, they cannot be said to be mere repetitions of one another. Both of them are equally capable of being connected with certain means and consequences, only when they are put forward in their full efficiency, and not otherwise.
tatra caturthe sādhanāṃśayogyavicāramanāityābhyupetya vā kevala sādhyāṃśavicāraḥ/ kimīḍaśena kāmaśabdopabandhara hitena varttamānaphalaṃ sambandhābhidhāyitā phalatvaṃ śakyate gamayituṃ na veti vicāraḥ /	IV, the discussion is based solely upon the factor of conse quences, and that of the means is either purposely disregarded or taken for granted and the discussion then turns mainly upon the following ques tion Is the Result capable of being rightly pointed out by means of words that speak of it as being accomplished at the present time, without any mention of the word Kama? While in the present Adhikarana the dis cussion is with regard to the factor of the means, that of the conse quences being either disregarded or taken for granted and the discussion turns upon the following question In the absence of any Injunctive affix, is it possible for certain Substances, Properties or Actions to be laid down as the means of obtaining definite results? Whatever may be pointed out in a certain form, it stands in need of the cognition of a certain definite corelative, and comes to be related with such a one, as ex pressed by another word.
evaṃ sādhanāvadhāraṇepīti ḍāvapyaṃśā svarūpeṇa nirūpayitavyau /	And hence when a certain sentence has been recognised as pointing out the Consequences, the rest is taken to indicate the Means and vice versâ thus both factors being ascertained in their true forms.
tadiha sādhanāṃśe vicāryamāṇa yo nāma phalāṃśasya saṃsparśaḥ sa caturthe siddhaḥ prasaṅgādvetutveneti mantavyaḥ / tathā yastatra sādhanāṃśaparāmarśa sa iha siddhastatra prasaṅgādityapunaruktam /	Consequently, the factor of the Means that is considered under the present Adhikarana, comes to be connected with the factor of the Consequence and it is this connection as here indicated that is accepted, in Adh. IV, as a wellestablished fact, and serves as the reason for the conclusion there arrived at. Conversely, the indication of the factor of the Means, that we have in Adh. IV, is here accepted as a well established fact, and is only slightly touched upon.
nanvevaṃ sati vidhyuddeśacinteyamityarthavādādhikaraṇena na sambadhyate/	And thus the two Adhikaranas are not mere repetitions. C Objection But in that case, the present would be a discussion with regard to the indication of the Injunction, and as such could not have any connection with the Adhikarana on Arthavada.
tadaśenaivārthaparicchedāt/	Reply This does not affect the case because the signification of the Injunction is got at through the Arthavada.
yadi hyasau vidhoyamānatayā pūrveṇāvagatastatonārthavādatvamatha stutyarthatayā tato 'rthavādatvamiti /	That is to say, if the Action spoken of were, in the very first instance, comprehended as being enjoined, then the passage could not have the character of the Arthavada but as it is, it is only through the Praise as signified by the passage that we compre hend the Action as being enjoined and as such the character of the Arthavada is not denied to the passage.
sarvathā sādhyasaṃnidhāne yaduccaritaṃ tadākāṅkṣāvaśena tādrapyeṇānupāttamapi sādhanaṃ bhavati yathaiva yāgenetyanuditaṃ sambadhyate ta thaivodumbareṇeti/	And hence, just as in the case of the mention of the Result, we at once comprehend the Sacrifice to be the means, on account of the expression Yageña by means of sacrifice directly presenting itself to our mind so in the same manner, the mention of the Result, in the case of the passage in question, would at once bring to our mind, the expression Audumbarēna by means of the post made of the Udumbara wood.
tatra vidhiḥ kiṃ kuryātpuruṣaṃ pravarttayet/	For, what could a direct Injunction do? It could only prompt the agent to action.
sa ca phalārthitayaiva pravṛtta iti kiṃ vidhinā / atha vā prayogavacana vihitasya phala sambandhamātramanena kriyate /	And as this prompting is done by the mere mention of the Result, what would be the use of a distinct direct Injunction? Or, the passage may be taken as merely pointing out the connection of a certain Result with that which has been enjoined in a passage laying down the procedure of a certain Action.
pañcamo vā lakāro vidhāsyati/	Or, the Injunction may be taken as expressed by the fifth Mood, Lēt.
arthavāḍhaikadeśo vetyuktameva tasmādūrjāvaruddhyā iti tādarthyacaturthyevaivaṃ kāmaśabdādapi sphuṭataraṃ phalamupāttamiti tasminnaumbaduratāvidhiḥ/	And it has also been already explained that the Injunction may, in certain cases, form only a part of the Arthavada. Hence we conclude that the Dative ending in Avarudhyai denotes purpose and as such the Result is pointed out by means of this affix even more clearly than it would have been by the word kama itself and hence it is with reference to this Result that the passage enjoins the post to be made of the Udumbara wood. It is in this way alone that the passage can be interpreted as an Injunction.
nanu phalasya vidhānamiti grahītavyaṃ bhāvārthādhikaraṇe phalavidhiniṣedhāt /	It can never be an Injunc tion of the Result because it is shown under IIi et seq that there can never be an Injunction of the Result.
ūgudumbara ityataḥ stutirityavirodhaḥ /	As for the sentence The Udum bara is power it is a distinct Praise of the particular wood and there is nothing incongruous in this.
tasmānmukhya vidhisambhave lacaṇayā na stutiḥ pratipattavyeti	Consequently, inasmuch as it is possible for the passage as a whole to be taken primarily, or directly, as an Injunction, it is not right to take it in its indirect sensemaking it indicative of mere Praise.
na pūrvatvāt	Reply Not so because it is known before hand.
nāyaṃ dṛṣṭāntaḥ stuteḥ pramāṇāntarāvagatyapekṣatvālloke tatsaṃbhavādupapattiḥ / vede tvaviditavādatvānna śraddadhoran /	To the last Sutra, we make the following reply The instance that you cite does not apply to the present case. Because a Praise depends upon certain conceptions derived from other means of knowledge and as the operation of such other means is possible with regard to the facts of ordinary experience, we can accept such ordinary assertions in the sense of Praise.
atha vā loka eva yadyaviditaṃ kaściddadettadā naiva śraddadhīran /	In the Veda, on the other hand, as we have descriptions of facts not otherwise known, people would have no faith in them as even in ordinary parlance, people do not believe a person who describes what is absolutely unknown.
pūrvavacanādiveti vidhyuddeśādi vā/ atha vā vaidharmyepamā / yathādhigatapūrvavacane śraddadhante naivama viditavāda/	Says the Bhashya Purvavacanādiva and this may mean that people do not have any confidence in descriptions of unknown facts, exactly as they have none in the Injunctions of facts already known or it may be taken as a simile of contraries, the meaning in that case being that in the descriptions of unknown facts people do not have the confidence that they have in those of wellknown facts.
na coktimātreṇaite bahuścorādayaḥ prarocayante kiṃ tarhi viditatvādeva /	And then again, the mere mention of the fact of the cow giving much milk does not serve to persuade the person it is only when he actually sees the cow giving much milk, that he is persuaded to take it.
vede tvarthavādāsatyatvena vidhau jātāśako na pravartteta /	In the Veda too, finding the Arthavāda to be false, the person would begin to suspect the authenticity of the Injunction connected with it and as such, he would not undertake the Action.
atha vā yo vidhimutkramyārthavādaṃ prārthayate nūnamasya vidhāvaviśramaḥ /	And one, who would neglect the Injunction and seek for the Arthavada, would be taken as an unbeliever of Injunctions.
tatra cedanāśvāso 'rthavāde kutaḥ pratyaya iti / api ca vede vyaktamasaṃvādo varttamānenorjevarodhaneneyaṃ stutirna ca tadasti/ tatrāvidyamānabahukṣīrasaṅkīrttanavadetatsyāt /	And if one has no confidence in Injunctions, wherefore should he have any in the concomitant Arthavada ? Then again, in the Veda, we find a disagreement from the actual facts of experience as for instance, the passage in question praises the action as fulfilling a reservation of power at the present time while no such reservation is perceptible and thus this declaration of the Veda would be exactly similar in falsity to the description of a cow as giving much milk, when as a matter of fact it gave no milk at all. As a matter of fact, the Udumbara is not found to have the character of strengthgiving food, which, for this reason, cannot rightly serve as the Predicate of the Minor Premiss nor is it found to be invariably con comitant with the appearance of power and hence it cannot serve as the middle term the subject of the Major Premiss.
svarūpatastāvadudumbaro 'nnatvaṃ paścadharmeṇāprasiddhaṃ anvayāprasiddheśva hetutvāprasiddhiḥ / na hi yadyadannaṃ sa sa yūpa iti loke vede vā prasiddhamityasambaddhaṃ tasmādasaṃvādādaraṃ vidhireva kiṃ stutyā saṃvādāpeściṣayeti	The fact of its being indirectly implied by the sen tence has alreay been explained. The sentence the Udumbara is strength is to be taken together with the clause for the increase of strength because it embodies a justification of this latter and it is not a distinct Praise apart by itself. Because the mere assertion of the Udumbara being food does not serve to point out the fact of its being something excellently desirable for man while there is no doubt that the assertion for the increase of strength serves to make the particular action specially attractive to him and hence it is only right that the other sentence Udumbara is food should be taken as justifying and supporting the said attraction or persuasion. Therefore the whole passage may be taken either as point ing out a definite result as following from the Action in question, or as persuading the agent to that course of Action.
vidhiścānarthakaḥ kva cittasmātstutiḥ pratīyeta tatsāmānyāditareṣu tathātvam tantravārtike / yadi caivañjātīyakā vidhayo bhaveyustataḥ pūrvodāhṛtāḥ sarvava dravyaguṇakriyāvidhayo bhaveyuḥ /	yahang And even if there were an Injunctive word, a passage like the one in question could not but be taken as an Arthavāda and it is all the more so, when the verb in the passage is only in the Present Tense, which has the sole purpose of accomplishing the Injunction. And when we find the context distinctly pointing to a definite purpose in the shape of the effect that it has towards the fulfilment of the sacrifice, what could be our reason for assuming a separate result, for the expression of which we have no direct word? Nor can it be urged that, that which is indicated by the Context is always set aside by that indicated by the Sentence itself.

āpaḥ śāntāḥ ūrgudumbara ityādi /	But in the passage in question, we have the Context pointing to the injunction of the post being made of the Udumbara wood and this Injunction takes within itself the persuasion expressed by the sentence the Udumbara is strength and certainly, there can be no contradiction of the Context, which, in this case, is found to indicate the Injunction of the Udumbara, as qualified by the said persuasion.
tatra yadyapi ke citkriyādividhayaḥ śakyante kartum /	Thus then, there being nothing to indicate any Injunc tion of the Result, there is no possibility of the Context being set aside and as such we cannot very well disregard the signification of the said Context.

Because the mere assertion of the Udumbara being food does not serve to point out the fact of its being something excellently desirable for man while there is no doubt that the assertion for the increase of strength serves to make the particular action specially attractive to him and hence it is only right that the other sentence Udumbara is food should be taken as justifying and supporting the said attraction or persuasion. Therefore the whole passage may be taken either as point ing out a definite result as following from the Action in question, or as persuading the agent to that course of Action.
vetasodāharaṇenaiva tulyatvādavakādonyapyudāhṛtāni /	And even if there were an Injunctive word, a passage like the one in question could not but be taken as an Arthavada and it is all the more so, when the verb in the passage is only in the Present Tense, which has the sole purpose of accomplishing the Injunction.

kena tarhyadbhiḥ / tāvatā tu na stutiḥ kā cidunmīlitetyarthavādāntarāpekṣāpravṛttāṃ tāṃ darśayati /	Because in other cases it might be possible for the Injunction to imply a persuasion but in the case in question, the Injunction itself is extremely weak not being mentioned by any directly expressive Injunc tive affix, &c. and as such, what could it do with the persuasion ? Then again, that which has once been made to serve the purpose of praising a certain action can never rightly be accepted as having any action towards the pointing out of any results, like the acquiring of fame.

The particular species Udumbara is, by its very nature, known as a part of the more extensive class Wood and it can never be taken as pointing to any Result.

But even if they must be taken as real means, they may be taken to be the means of fulfilling the pleasure or satisfaction of the persons concerned.

Hence we conclude that we cannot but take these passages as Arthavādas. .

Some people object to this Adhikarana they argue thus If the character of the reason be said to be enjoined by the passage, then these come in the same category as those dealt with in the foregoing “Adhikarana if not, then the character of the reason that is spoken of here must be taken in connection with the relationship of the Curpahoma and as no such relationship can exist unless it is duly enjoined, for what could the reason be brought forward? If however, the passage be taken only as describing a fact in nature, then this would be in the same category as the sentence speaking of Vayu as the eftest deity.

Ll To this we make the following reply As a matter of fact the passage in question does not lay down the fact of the latter sentence containing a reason for what has gone before nor is it the mere descrip tion of a fact in nature what it really does is only to assert by Apparent Inconsistency, a certain fact, which serves to set aside a certain doubt with regard to the performability of an Action which has been laid down in the previous sentence simply as a wellestablished duty to be performed specially as all Reasoning presupposes a certain well established fact which, in this case, is the performability of the Curpa homa.
yāpi cārthavādākāṅkṣā kasmāditi sāpyanenaiva hetunā nivarttyata iti manyate /	And some people hold that this statement of the Reason also serves the purposes of an Arthavada, showing, as it does, why a person should perform it.

sambandhasya ca vidheyatvāttadgatameva hetutvaṃ homasyeti vadati /	Says the Bhashya The fact of the Curpa being a means of preparing the food is brought forward as a Reason for performing the Homa with the Curpa. And though what is directly enjoined is the relationship of the Homa with the Curpa, yet the Reason that is brought forward for this relation ship could also refer to the Homa.
nanvaprasiddhe kāryakāraṇabhāvaiti /	An objection is raised in the Bhashya A case like that of the Curpa and the food, where the relation of cause and effect is not generally recognised, cannot be rightly said to have been brought forward as a Reason.
ke cir̤hāḥ / kāryakāraṇayorevānumānam / tathā ca dadhnendriyakāmasyetyatrāpi vakṣyati /	Some people explain this by pointing to the premiss that all Inference must be one of cause and effect, as the Bhashya declares later on in connection with the sentence One should offer a Homa of curd for the sake of one who wants to acquire a senseorgan.
kāryakāraṇabhūtānāmapi kṛttikādīnāmacirodgatarohiṇyādipratipattihetutvadarśanāt /	But this is not correct because even in cases where there is no relation of cause and effect, as in the case of the asterisms of Krttika and Rohini, following one another, we find that a perception of the former acts as a reason or means for the cognition of the latter.
ato gamyagamakatvameva kāryakāraṇabhāvaṃ manyate /	Therefore we must take the Bhashya to mean only the relation ship of the comprehended and the means of comprehension, by the mention of the relation of cause and effect.

Or, the Bhashya may be taken as referring to the potentiality of things, the meaning of the objection in the Bhashya being that we admit the character of true Reason only in cases where, at the time of comprehending an invariable concomitance between the two things con cerned, we actually perceive in them a potentiality consisting of that causal relationship which consists of the relationship of the comprehended and the means of comprehension.
avinābhāvo hyanekakāryakāraṇasvasvāmisahacarabhāvādiprabheda bhinnastatrānna karaṇatā home hetutvenoccamānasambandhāntarābhāvātkāraṇatvena syāt /	Or again, the Bhashya may be taken as only referring to the specific instance cited, the sense of the objection being that an invariable concomitance between any two things, can be based upon many relations, such as those of cause and effect, master and servant, or on mere associa tion, and the like and as non of the others are possible in the case of the fact of the Curpa as the means of preparing food being asserted as the reason for performing the particular Homa, we must accept it to be based on the causal relation only and inasmuch as such causal relationship is not generally found to exist between them, the assertion that the latter sentence puts forth a Reason for the Homa is untenable.
taccāprasiddhaṃ tasmānna cetvapadeśaḥ /	In reply to the above objection, the Bhashya saysTrue it is, &c.

kiṃ prayojanamiti yadi ca heturavatiṣṭhetetyanenābhiprāyeṇa / aparasvāda vyāptī siddhāyāṃ sarvānnasādhanasādhanako homaḥ siddho bhavati / kuta iti /	The Bhashya puts the questionwhat special purpose would be served, .e., if the Reason should become relevant? The reply given is that the use lies in the fact that it is only then that the Homa could be offered by means of all things that are used in the preparation of food. The Bhashya puts another questionwhy? And this question may be taken as put by the Siddhanti or it may meanHow can the Darvi &c., be the means of preparing the food? The reply given is thatwe actually find these of use in the preparation of food and it is this usefulness alone that is mentioned in the Sutra by the word arthavattva.
sa eva siddhāntābhiprāyaḥ /	The Bhashya also addswe can prepare the food by means of these also and this is what is meant by the word upapatti possibility in the Sutra.
athavā kuto darvipiṭharādeḥ sādhakatamatvam / itarastvācānnakriyāyāṃ tāvattasyārthavattāsti tāvanmācaṃ vāśrayiṣyate / śakyate ca tenāpītyupapattiśabdasyārthaḥ /	and as this is quite irrelevant as it is, we must take it along with the closing sentences of the Bhashya, Says the Bhashyathere can be only an indirect indication of Praise and this means that the sentence in question indicates the excellence of the Homa, indirectly, through the fact of its bringing about a universally desirable result in the shape of food. And in this case, the sentenceÇürpēna hi annan kriyateis to be taken as only describing a fact of nature, the general preparation of food with reference to the particular object, Curpa. Hote Or, the Sutra may be construed in the following manner If we take the sentence as laying down a Reason, we have an arthavattvai.e., it serves a much more useful purpose than if it were a mere Arthavada and even though the relationship between the Curpa and the preparation of food is not quite recognised, yet we have its upapatti proof or possibility based upon the assumed Vedic sentence referred to above.
pūrveṇa tu samānārthatā gamyate /	Sutra . It is a Praise because of its being preceded by verbal authority while there is no Injunction of another.
tena vivakṣā /	This is what is meant by the expressionThere is no In junction of another, i.e., of the Darvi, &c.
śaktyabhiprāyametat / yadeva hi tadupayogimācaṃ tadeva śakyate kathaṃ ci prathamādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	As for the pointing out of a reason for the performance of the Homa in a certain way, this becomes accomplished by the Praise itself and as such by taking the sentence as pointing out such a Reason only, we only court the necessity of having to assume unheard of instances. C Then again, the direct assertion of the Curpa as the instrument to be employed falling within the scope of the Injunction, being found to be distinct, and not having any other purpose to serve, it cannot be altogether neglected.
mādhakatamatvena vivaścitum /	The meaning of the said expression thus comes to be The Curpa is an excellent instrument, because it prepares the food.
atha vārthavattvaṃ karaṇavibhakti nirde śālambanamupapattyā punarvarttamānānna kriyasya hetutvābhidhānāttādṛśasya homaṃ pratyanupapattyā śaṅkayopapattiṃ vadani, śakyate ca teneti/	Both of these explana tions are capable of being supported by wellrecognised instances, and as such do not necessitate the Inference of any unheard of Vedic texts. Because it is a universally recognised fact that, that which is excellent deserves to be done, and that, that which is a means of preparing the food is excellent. The sentence there is no Injunction of another may be explained in another way According to you, all that is a means of preparing the food, will be the objects of Injunction but Darvi, &c., are not the means of preparing the food because it is the action, of cooking f.i., that is known to be the direct means of the preparation of the food. This introduces the next Sutra. Sutra .
tatra codayati /	To this we make the following reply Sutra .
etaddhi kriyataityucyate tatkathaṃ śakyatai tyabhidhīyate / varttamānakriyasyāsambhavādittyuttaram /	And it would be necessary to assume the word in the present tense Kriyatē to indicate the meaning of a word in the past Akūri, and in the future Kārishyatē, or that of a word denoting the present character of the Capability such as Çakyate and it is only when the word Kriyate could be taken in accordance with these assump tions, that the Instrumental case ending in Çürpēna could be taken as denoting direct instrumentality.
yadi ca na darvipiṭharādītyubhayoḥ parāmaśaḥ sādhakatamatvavarttamānatve cettatra na vidyete ṭarpe 'pi tathaiveti stutirna syāt /	If, again, the words be taken in their direct signification, then, it would not be possible for the Veda to enjoin anything as capable of being brought forward, while it would be pointing out either the present time or the chief Instrument. That is to say, the Homa is not capable of being performed either by the Curpa, &c., while these are actually being employed in the preparation of the food, or by the cooking which is held to be the chief Instrument or means of the preparation of food.
tena yathā tava stutyarthaḥ kathaṃ cidvidyate tathā mama hetvartha ityaviśeṣaḥ / hetau ca śrutirityādyasambaddhavākya sambandhi doṣādante draṣṭavyam /	Therefore, in both cases, the theory is absolutely untenable. According to our theory, on the other hand, inasmuch as the sentence in question is taken only as explanatory of the foregoing, the words can be taken in their indirect significations. For instance, in ordinary parlance, we find such an expression as Balavan Devadattah, where though the affix Matup in Balavan has been laid down to be in the sense of Excess, yet we do not find it clearly expressed as to in comparison with whom Devadatta is strong and the direct signification of the word balavan.
stutau lakṣaṇetyannakaraṇatvena sarvajanābhimatena prāśastyaṃ lakṣyate/	would be that he is the strongest among all living beings but this is not possible because, as a matter of fact, there are many stronger animals, such as the Lion, &c. hence we take the word to signify the presence of a strength greater only than that of those animals that are known to be weaker than Devadatta.
itthaṃ vā sūtragamanikā tatrārthavattvaṃ tāvadarthavādātprayojanavattaratvamupapattirityaprasiddhaṃ sambandho 'pi kālpanikavāyat tasmādvetuḥ	Exactly in the same manner, we can speak of the Curpa as the chief instrument in the preparation of the food, in com parison to such objects as the plough and the like, which have a much more remote instrumentality in that preparation. It may be argued that in that case such comparative signification of the word would come to be its chief denotation and it is for this reason that the word balavan, used with reference to Devadatta, is not admitted to have any indirect signification.
vyarthe stutiranyāyyeti cet	This is true enough, when the word balavan is used with reference to Dēvadatta, in comparison with weaker persons in general but when the word is found to be incapable of referring to certain weak persons in parti cular, it would directly give rise to an idea of Devadatta being stronger than even those who possess greater strength and in that case, if we take the word to point to the fact of Dēvadatta being stronger than those weaker than him, then this would be taking it in an indirect sense.
yatpunaḥ śūrpe 'pyannakaraṇatvānupapatteḥ stutirna prāpnotītyuktaṃ kiṃ tatrābhidhīyate yadi ca heturavatiṣṭheta nirdeśātsāmānyāditi cedavyavasthā vi dhīnāṃ syāt	In accordance with your theory, on the other hand, the sentence being an Injunction, and as such laying down something not got at by other means, the fact of the Cürpa being the principal Instrument, as also its present character, would have to be taken as mentioned with reference to the Action in question and as such there would be no ground for any Compari son or Secondary indirect character and hence there would be a greater difficulty in the interpretation of the sentence. And thus there is no equality between the two theories. If it were a Reason, it would be restricted to the Qurpa only because of the specification. If it be urged that through singularity the Darvi, &c., would also be taken as refer red to, then, in that case, there would be an indecisiveness of the Injunctions.
abhyupetya vādo 'yam /	This Sutra admits, for the sake of argument, the position of the opponent.
yadyapi hetuvidhānaṃ tathāpi na darvipiṭharādeḥ prasaṅgaḥ /	Even if the sentence were an Injunction of the Reason that Injunction could not be taken as referring to the Darvi, &c.
kutaḥ śūrpaṃ hi vidhāyānnakaraṇaṃ heturucyate /	Because it is distinctly with reference to the Curpa that the sentence lays down the Reason, in the shape of its being an instrument in the preparation of food.
so'pi ca na loke prasiddhaḥ śavdameva dṛṣṭāntavācinamanumāya sādhayitavyaḥ / tadanumāne ca śrutahetutvānyathānupapattiḥ pramāṇaṃ sāca yāvatyeva hetuttramupapannaṃ tato 'dhikakalpanāyai na prabhavati/	And specially as such instrumentality is not recognised in ordinary experi ence, the only resource that we have, for taking the injunction to refer to the Darvi, &c., also, is to assume a Vedic text bringing forward an instance in support of the sentence in question. But for assuming such a text, the only ground that we can have is the apparent inconsistency of another direct Vedic text the sentence in question and as a matter of fact, this apparent inconsistency cannot justify the assumption of anything more than what is absolutely necessary for the consistency of the Vedic text in question.
śūrpeca homasambandhitvena pratijñāte 'nyadharmasyā hetutvādavaśyaṃ tadgatamevānnakaraṇatvaṃ vaktavyam /	Then again, the connection of the Curpa with the Homa having been laid down, the mention of the properties of any other things would be no reason for such relationship and hence it would be necessary to mention a certain quality of the Curpa alone,viz., its instrumentality in the pre paration of the food and on account of the proximity of the description of the quality to a mention of the Curpa, we conclude that the description refers to the Curpa alone.
loke 'pi ca yaṃ dharmiṇaṃ pratijñāya yo heturupadiśyate sa prathamaṃ tāvattadgata viśeṣātmanaiva pratīyate / tadātmakasya tu sādhyāṃśānugamābhāvātmāmānyamātraṃ vivaścitamiti dṛṣṭāntaprayogavelāyāmevāvadhāryate vedacetūnāṃ punarna sāmānyātmanā sādhyasambandho 'vagato na viśeṣātmanā so 'dhunaivārthāpatyā kalpanīyaḥ /	Even in ordinary parlance, we always find that when a certain property is mentioned in connection with a certain object, the quality is cognised, first of all, only as belonging to that object as for instance in the argument Fire, because smoke the smoke which is the Reason is cognised at first, as resid ing in the particular mountain only and it is only when the corroborative instance comes to be cited Whatever has smoke is fiery, as the culinary hearth that we come to recognise the fact that it is the smoky substance in general that is meant as otherwise, with the particular case alone, there could be no unified collective idea of the presence of fire that is to say, unless we have an idea that wherever there is smoke there is fire, we cannot deduce the presence of fire from the presence of smoke. In the Veda, the Reason is not cognised as appertaining to what has to be proved by it, either in its genuine or specific form the particular sort of relationship has always got to be assumed in accordance with Apparent Inconsistency.
tadakalpane hi hetunirdeśa śruto virudhyate /	of the Reason with regard to the Curpa would remain inconsistent.
yadi tu darvipiṭharādigatānnakaraṇatvahomasa prathamādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda / mvandhāvinābhāvo na kalpyate /	On the other hand, if we omit to assume the fact of the Homa being connected with such other implements as the Darvi and the like, there is nothing, either directly perceived or mentioned in the Veda, that would remain inconsistent for want of such an assumption.
na kiṃ cicchutaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ vā nāvakalpate tasmādodṛśaṃ dṛṣṭāntavacanaṃ kalpyaṃ yadyaccūrṇamannakaraṇaṃ tena tena juhotīti/	Therefore the only instance that we could assume would be in some such form as whichever Curpa is found to be instrumental in the preparation of food, is also used in the offering of the Homa.
tadeta dviśeṣa dṛṣṭa manumānam/	The inference of such a text would be what is technically known as the Viçeshadrshta Inference.
loke'pi tṛṇadhūmadarśanāttṛṇāgnirevānumīyate nāgnimātram / yathā ca gamanaṃ gośabdavyutpattinimittatvenopādīyamānaṃ sāsnādimatmāmānyapratyayottarakālaṃ tadgatameva nimittatvaṃ pratipadyate na gantṛ mātra viṣayamiti gośabdavyavasthā tathā śūrpagatānnakaraṇahetvapadeśānnānyagatahetutvaprasaṅgaḥ /	For instance, even in ordinary experience, if the smoke that is perceived is recognised as proceeding from a particular grass, the fire that is inferred is also that proceeding from the burning of that grass, and not Fire in general and again though the root gam is generally recognised as denoting to go yet when perceived, in the word go cow f.i., after the word has been found to denote the particular animal with dewlaps, &c., it comes to be recognised as pointing to the going of the cow only, and not to that of all moving things. Exactly in the same manner, inasmuch as the Reasonthe Instrumentality in the preparation of food has been mentioned in distinct connection with the Curpa, it cannot be regarded as pertaining to any other things. Thus then, the meaning of the sentence would be this Whichever Çürpa is found capable of preparing the food should be used in the offering of the Homa and any other objects, the Darvi, &c., cannot be included in this. For instance, when a strongly blown fire is mentioned as the Reason for burning, it points to the fact that, if not strongly blown, the Fire would not burn, and not that the conchshell, when strongly blown, would burn.
tatraināvānarthaḥ syāt /	Thus alone could any definite interpretation be arrived at.
yadyadannakaraṇasamarthaṃ śa tena tena hotavyaṃ na darvipiṭharādigrahaṇam /	Because the Scriptures lay down directions for the use of mantras, they cannot be meant to convey any mean ings.
yathā balavadupadhmāte 'gnau dahanahetutvenokte sa evānupadhmāto na dadded, na tu śaṅkhādayo balavadupadhmātā dahanti /	Because all words are distinctly found to convey some sort of a meaning and as such there can never be any question as to their having a meaning for instance, Fire being found to actually burn certain things, we do not proceed to consider whether or not it is capable of burning. As a matter of fact, all cases, the potentialities of words are inferred from the effects that they actually bring about and in the case of mantras, we find that as soon as they are pronounced, they convey a certain definite meaning.
tasmāyavasthā /	And hence there is an occasion for discussion on this point.

Reply We have already considered the Purvapaksha that the Veda having the sole purpose of pointing out the Actions to be performed, that which is not found to serve such a purpose must be concluded to be useless and untrustworthy and hence the question of the authority of the mantras in the matter of Dharma being only a phase of this previous Purvapaksha, the answer that we have given on the former occasion would apply to this case also and as such there can be no need for bringing up the question of the authority of the mantras. Specially as we all know that when even such apparently incoherent sentences asHe wept and from that was silver produced are capable of being somehow or other made out to be an authority with regard to Dharma, there can be no doubt with regard to the authority of the mantras.
agnirmūrddheti yo 'rthaḥ pratoyate sa mūrddhāgnirityanenāpītyanartha ko niyamaḥ /	And hence all that we have got to consider now is the question of the particular uses of the mantras.

Then the only use that is left lies in the employment of the words of the mantras and hence it is only natural to consider the question as to their being used for the purpose of conveying some meaning, or for that of giving evpres sion to the mere words.
yastu dṛṣṭārtheṣu prakṛtipratyayasamāseṣu niyamo dṛśyate /	In the case of the Samas too, though they have no meanings, yet we can have a doubt as to whether they are pronounced merely for the sake of being pronounced, or for the sake of giving expression to the letters composing them.
yuktaṃ tatra viparyaye 'paśabdārthānyatvānarthakyaprasaṅgāt/	Thus it is that the sentence in the Bhashyado$ the mantras help by the mere utterancewhich savours of being the declara tion of a wellestablished factceases to be absolutely incoherent.
ajādyadantaviśeṣaṇatvādinimitto hi tatra niyataḥ pūrvanipātaḥ smaryate /	Or, it may be that the Purvapaksha accepts the fact of the mantras being actually used, as being in accordance with the theory of persons knowing all about sacrifices and hence not discussing this, it takes up another discussion.
tenāgnīndrāvitya sādhutvaṃ puruṣarāja ityarthānyatvaṃ kauśāmbini rityanarthakatvam/ yastvagnīndrāviti kva citprayogaḥ sa chāndaso grervā 'bhyarcitatvasya vivaśvayeti mantavyam /	And as for the question How is it that the theory of persons knowing the details of sacrifices has been left aside, and its correctness or incorrectness has not been tested?, the reason why this point has been disregarded is this That the mantras are actually used is a fact firmly established by the mere fact of their being accepted as such by all the best men of the three higher castes,exactly like the works on Smrti this fact cannot be set aside and hence it is the very source or basis of this fact that we proceed to consider.
tuncakaśārthapratītāvindrāgnīparameva vyavasthitam / nanvihāpi kramānyatvādamantratvaṃ syāt /	And if the Purvapaksha theory turns out to be the correct one, then, there being no other authority for the said fact, we shall seek for it in the Inference of Vedic texts laying down the use of the mantra in question while in accordance with the Siddhanta theory the Indicative Power and the Context of the mantra itself would serve as the required authority.
tadevārthaparatve mati tadavināśe tu kiṃ nimittamiti na vidmaḥ /	Of these the former are found to serve a purpose, by a distinct pointing out of what they directly signify viz., the performance of certain minor sacrifices and hence though they have certain verbal forms of themselves, they do not serve any purpose, through these verbal forms.
tena mantraprasiau vākyaniyamādityapi sūtram / atha vā 'stvaprakaraṇādhītavākyaniyamāt / na hārthābhidhāne'nyadīyasyātmīyasya ca viśeṣaḥ /	As for the Injunction of the study of the Veda, this too, having its purposes fulfilled by the more proximate verbal text of the mantras, cannot extend to the more distant deno tation or meaning of these mantras. In the case of the passages dealing with the Prayajas, &c., also, though our first impression is that of these also, it is the verbal text only that is to be employed,yet, such use is concluded to be improper, when it is found that they express certain facts, that are distinctly useful in the actual performance of the sacrifices.
atha vā mantrapauruṣeyavākyayostunye 'rthābhidhānasāmarthya mantravākya niyamo 'dṛṣṭārthaḥ / athavā 'neka dhyānādismaraṇopāyaprasaṅge vākyaniyamāt /	Then again, it is only when the verbal text is not found to be of any use that we conclude the purpose of a sentence to be in what it signifies in the case of the mantras, however, we find that it is their verbal texts that serve distinctly useful purposes. And even if the meaning of a sentence be held to be more important than its verbal form, it is only to the word that a person has to be directed first of all because the meaning is expressed after the word has been used. And hence we conclude that it is the mere verbal form of the mantra that is of use in the per formance of sacrifices.
na hi dṛṣṭe 'rthe mantrasya dhyānādervā kaścidviśeṣa ityadṛṣṭārthatā	In consideration of the order of the Siddhanta Sutras, we should change the order of the examples cited, from the Abhryādāna down wards. The Bhashya, however, has not paid any heed to the order of the examples, because it was thought that the discussion would be equally clear, wherever the examples might be cited, and hence he begins with the mantraUrupratha, Uruprathasva, &c.
avidyamānavacanāt	Says the Bhashya Just as one who has eyes, &c.
yadyapi ca guṇavādena kiṃ citsyāttathāpi tadanuṣṭhānābhāvānna tatsmṛtyā kāryam / na ca jñāyate kva pradeśe prayujyatāmiti /	It may be urged that in the case in question also, any change in the order of the words would make the sentence lose the character of a mantra. But this would be the case only if no meaning were desired to be conveyed by the mantra while if the meaning were desired to be conveyed, then inasmuch as a change in the order of the words would not make any difference in the meaning of the mantra, we do not know on what ground it could be said to lose its true character.
tatra mantrapāṭhakamānurodhenoccāraṇamāpatatīti si ddhaḥ pūrvaḥ paścaḥ /	And thus the present Sutra could be taken as pointing to the fact of the character of the mantra being established with regard to a certain sentence, on the ground of the order of the words being fixed.
mā mā hiṃsīrmā mā santāptamityādīni vedihaprathamādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda / vinādi viṣayatvāda cetanārtha bandhanādityatrāpyudāharaṇam /	C Because of the directions pertaining to the learned. We find that there is an Injunction. Nor can it be urged that the mantra serves the purpose of reminding the Priest of the meaning of the words because such remembrance is found to be accomplished by means of the expert character of the Priest, obtained from a thorough study of the Brahmanas. And as for the means of manifesting this expert character, we could accept either the completion of the previous action, or the duly studied Brāhmana itself, to be this means and hence the mantras could serve no useful purpose in connec tion with this manifestation.

And as a matter of fact, we find that all revered teachers learned in the Veda put forth their efforts towards the teaching, to the students, of the mere Verbal Text of the mantras, and not to wards that of its meaning, though it is always in close proximity to the text.

na ca mantrārthaḥ sattāmātreṇopakaroti kriyāvelāyāmasmaryamāṇa iti yadekāntenaśakyaṃ karttumuccāraṇaṃ tadeva kāryami vyavadhāryate	Nor can the meaning of the mantras help the sacrifice by its mere existence, if it happens to be lost sight of at the time of the performance of the sacrifice. Hence we conclude that it is by its mere reciting, which can always be done, that the mantra can help the performance.

Sutra . But there is no difference in the signification of sentences in the Veda from those in ordinary parlance. The repetition of the mantra ending in the mere comprehension of its verbal text cannot, by this alone, be recognised as in any way forming part of the sacrifice specially as the mere letters of the mantra, like the materials used, not forming part of the Procedure of the sacrifice, can not be held to be comprehended by means of the Context.
evaṃ padārthajñānasya vākyārthapratyayena nairākācyādagrahaṇam /	Similarly, the cognition of the meanings of the component words also are wholly taken up by the indication of the meaning of the sentence composed by them and as such, this too cannot be said to be compre hended by means of the Context.

Because the only ground for such an assumption is the Apparent Inconsistency of something laid down in the Veda and when this latter is duly justified on the ground of the mantra having a distinct meaning, there can be no ground for assuming any transcendental esult to follow from it.
yadyapi ca tatkalpanāvasaro bhavet tathāpi kāmaṃ vākyārthapratyayādeva na tvaupayikārthapratītinirākāṅkādākyāt/	Even when there might be an occasion for such an assumption, the transcendental result could be taken as following from a comprehension of the meaning of the sentence constituting the mantra, and not from the sentence itself, independently of its distinctly useful meaning.
avaśyaṃ ca dṛṣṭādṛṣṭayorviniyujyamānasya pramāṇamupanyasitavyamiha ca prakaraṇādadṛṣṭārthatā liṅgācca dṛṣṭārthatā /	With regard to the visible and transcendental results of anything that has to be employed, we must bring forward evidences and in the case in question we find that the fact of the mantra having a visible use is borne out by the Indicative Power Linga of the mantra itself whereas the fact of its having only a transcendental result can, at best, be supported by the Context alone.
na ca pra karaṇamaśakye 'rthe viniyoktumarhatītyekāntenaitadāpatati yaccanuyāttanmantreṇa kuryāditi/	Then again, as a matter of fact, no amount of Context can rightly lay down the employment of a certain thing accomplishing that which it is absolutely incapable of accomplishing and hence the long and short of the whole thing is that we should employ the mantra in the fulfilment of that which is capable of accomplishing.
na cāsāvadṛṣṭaṃ śaknototi laukikaṃ vaidikaṃ vā pramāṇaṃ vidyate /	And as for the fact of the mantra bringing about any transcendental results, we have no evidences of it, either in the Veda, or in ordinary experience.

Thus then, the usage of persons learned in the sacrifices becoming supported by the mantra itself there is no need of taking all the trouble of assuming any other grounds for the usage.

paruṣārthānupayogena svādhyāyādhyayana vidherānarthakyāt / naca buddhaśākhā vidyamānavacanāceta nārthabandhanānmantrārthopayogaḥ /	natural to conclude that it is the meaning of the mantra that is the chief factor being of use at the sacrifice. Nor can it be held to be necessary to assume the usefulness of the meaning of the mantra, on account of the facts urged in Sutras , , and and when we cannot avoid the assumption of a transcendental result, in the end, we must assume it to follow immediately from there repetition for there is no reason for postponing it specially as the necessity of repeat ing the mantra is acknowledged by both of us and it is this fact that gives rise to the assumption of the transcendental result in ques tion.
tatrocyate / yajñe yajñāṅgaprakāśanameva prayojana miti /	To this, we make the following reply In the performance of sacrifices, the only useful purpose that the mantra can serve lies in the indicating of some thing auxiliary to the sacrifice.
yadyapi lokavattairna saṃvyavahārastathāpi tatsvarūpaprakāśana mātra mevānuṣṭhātṝṇāmupakara vyati/ ataśca yāvanmātramevānaupayikaṃ sambodhanādi kāmaṃ tanna vivakṣyeta na tu tadarśana sarvameva vyaktatryaṃ na hokarūpyaṃ nāma kena tantravārtike /	of being used like the ordinary things of the world, yet the mere indication of the forms of these would help the performers of the sacrifice. Therefore we conclude that it is only those parts of the mantraas the words of address, &c., in the Vocativethat do not serve the purpose of indicating such auxiliaries, that can be said to be uttered, without any desire on the part of the speaker, to convey a definite meaning and this mere fact cannot justify us in rejecting the significance of the whole mantra specially as there is noth ing in the world that is always of one and the same form and character. For these reasons, inasmuch as a theory must be in keeping with well recognised facts, we must conclude that such mantras as Varhirdēvasadan dāmiare always used with a desire to convey a definite meaning. As for the sentence tancaturbhirādattē Vide Bhashya on Sutra we offer the following explanation www.c Sutra .
cinniyatam /	The repetition is for purposes of qualification.
tasmādyathādarśanābhyupagamāirhidevasadanaṃ dāmotyevamādīnāṃ tāvadavihatamarthaprādhānyam/ tāṃ caturbhirādattadtyatrāpi vadāmaḥ	Though the mantras are already got at by means of their own denota tive power, yet the sentence in question, which lays down that the four mantras are to be repeated at the time of holding the reins, may be taken as laying down the number four. And hence, in accordance with the reasonings brought forward in connection with the passagehe purchases the Soma with an one year old cow, &c.,the qualifications tend to limit one another and hence, if no collective potentiality be admitted, there could not be an Injunction of the holding of the reins with the mantras numbering four con sequently it is clear that this Injunction is a direct result of the collective potentiality of the qualifications.
yāvaddhi mantrāmnāna manavagataprayojanaṃ prakaraṇī cākṛtāthastāvadyattatsiddhyarthaṃ kalapyate tatsarvaṃ vaidikaṃ bhavati/ nairākāṅkṣyottarakālaṃ tu kaccitamapi pauruṣeyatvādapramāṇaṃ syāt /	Z Or, it may be that long before we proceed to assume, with reference to each particular mantra, a distinct Vedic direction, as indicated by the indicative power of the mantras themselves, the direct declaration in the shape of the sentence he holds it with the four mantras will have enjoined the mantras as qualified by the number four and as such enjoining something not got at by other means, the sentence comes to be a pure Injunction. As for the pointing out of the mantras themselves, these could be pointed out by their own indicative power, even without the direction and as such the sentence in question could be of very little use in that con.
tadetadāha /	Sutra . There is an exclusion.
sati ca vākye liṅgaṃ viyojakaṃ taccāsya nāstīti / yadaiva hi prakaraṇādanena yajeta raśanāṃ vā gṛhṇīyāditi kalpayitumighyate tadaivāśvābhidhānomityanenāpahāromantrasya /	So long as the purpose of the laying down of the mantra has not been duly realised, and the treatment of the subjectmatter remains deficient in certain points, whatever assumptions we might make, for the accomplish ment of these purposes, must be accepted as having the support of the Veda while when all deficiencies have been supplied, if we make the slightest assumption, it cannot but be absolutely without any authority. And we shall show later on that Indicative Power, Context, &c., have no authority of their own, unless they point to a direct Vedic text. That is to say, it is only when the Context enables to ascer is to be employed in the offering of the sacrifice or in the holding of the reins, that the addition of the clause the reins of the horse can serve to restrict it.
yadapi naiva saṃbandha ityādattaiti kathaṃ tatyaśvābhidhāno miti tatkārakasaṃbandhāsaṃbhavātkriyayaiva saha na sāmānyābhiprāyeṇa draṣṭavyam /	with the noun being possible, and not to mere relationship in general and thus we conclude that the mantra is laid down as to be used, not in all holding, but in the holding of the horses reins. Or, it may be that what the sentence does is to bring forward the subsequent relationship of the noun in the Accusative case because this is all the that is necessary for the particular result aimed at that is to say, relationship is that of the particular Noun, and is perceived after the Injunction of the holding with the mantra of the reins of the horse. In any case the objections urged under Sutra Iii do not apply to our theory, if we accept the explanation thus put forward.
tasmānādānamātre vidhīyate kiṃ tarhyaśvābhidhānīviśiṣṭe / athavā prathamādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	Hence in the case in question it is an Injunction that is spoken of as Parisankhya, on account of the peculiar character of what it finally leads to. Question What then would be the difference among Injunction, Restriction and Exclusion ? Reply An Injunction is of that which lays down something not got at by any other means we have a Restriction where the thing in question is already got at partially and we have an Exclusion where the thing is found to exist in two contrary positions.
phalataḥ paścāttanakāraka saṃbandha upanyasyate /	And the restricting of the means of the preparing of rice to threshing only is more proximate to the sentence than the setting aside of another alternative.
sarvathā darśaśāvatā nāsti/ yadi hi yadeva mantravacanātprāpnayāttadeva pratyakṣavacanenocyate tato vayamupālabhyemahi / nanvevamaprāpta vidhirevāyaṃ saṃjāta iti na vaktavyaṃ parisaṃkhyeti phalenaivamabhidhānādadoṣaḥ /	But in the case in question, the sentence does not appear actually after both actions have been pointed out, because we have not assumed any Vedic direction for the holding of the reins of the ass hence all that we mean is that if we had not the sentence‘ityaçvābhidhānīm, &c., then, the mantra could be employed in the holding of the reins of the ass also. Specially as in the case of all direct assertions of the Veda, we do not take them as serving B the e sole purpose of barring the way of all assumed sentences that is to say, if it were so, then the sole use of the sentence in question would be in this barring, and it could not be taken as setting aside the application of the mantra to the holding of the reins of the ass because what would be the use of having a sentence for a purpose the barring of the way of assumed sentences that could be served by other means? Hence for the sake of the Vedic sentence in question, we assume its purpose to lie in the setting aside of the application of the mantra to the holding of the ass reins.
sarvatra hi parisaṃkhyāśabdādevakārādvā vinā na śrutyā parisaṃkhyāniyamo vocyate vidhireva tvevaṃ jātīyakasya phalenaivaṃ vyapadeśaḥ / kastarhi vidhiniyamaparisaṃkhyanāṃ bhedaḥ /	When however the use of the mantra is distinctly restricted by the sentence in question, all that we want to know being duly pointed out, no room is left for the assuming of Vedic texts laying down the common application of the mantra to the reins of the horse as well as of the ass and hence it comes to be definitely ascertained that the mantra is to be employed in the holding of the reins of the horse only and thus there being no repetition, the sentence in question is found to serve a distinctly useful purpose.
uccate /	Sutra . Or, it may be an Arthavada.
vidhiratyantamaprāpte niyamaḥ pākṣike sati / tatra cānyatra ca prāpte parisaṃkhyeti korcyate/ vidhireva hi kena cidviśeṣeṇaivaṃ bhidyate /	In the case of the sentence With the mantra O, magnificent one, become greatly magnified, he enlarges the cake,followed, at a certain distance, by the sentence, by this the master of the sacrifice himself becomes magnified,though the latter, being in a different place, cannot be taken as eulogising the former injunction of the mantra, yet inasmuch as it is the magnifying or enlarging of the cake that forms the object of the Injunction, the whole sentence could be useful, only if it helped in persuading the agent to such enlarging and it is in support of such persuasion that we have the latter sentence.
tatra yo 'tyantamaprāpto na ca prāpsyati prāgvacanādityavagamyate tatra niyogaḥ śuddha evaṃ vidhiryathā brohīnprokṣatīti / yatra tu prāgvacanātyākṣi kī prāptiḥ sambhāvyate tatrāprāptipaścaṃ pūrayanyo vidhiḥ pravarttate sa niyantṛtvānniyama ityucyate /	Thus then we find that the praising of the enlargement serves a distinctly useful purpose. Objection In that case the praise of the enlargement being accom plished by means of the sentenceverily it magnifies the master of the sacrifice himself,the mention of the mantra would be absolutely useless. Reply Not so because the valedictory sentence has been added with the sole view of praising the mantra alone and the whole thing comes to this The enlargement should be done the mantra serves as a means of this enlargement and to the mantra are also added the words uru të yajnapatih prathatām May your master of the sacrifice also become magni fied!. And in that case, the sentence, Verily the master of the sacrifice himself becomes magnified, comes to point out a sacrificial accessory in the shape of a few words to be added to the mantra.
yathā broddīnavahantīti /	?and answers it in the negative because, as a matter of fact it serves the purpose of praising, in accordance with the rule laid down in the Sūtra IViii.
tandulaniṣpattyaryākṣepādeva tatmidverna tatprāptimātraṃ vidheḥ phalaṃ kiṃ ta rhyaprāptāṃśapūraṇam /	And though in the case in question, on account of the mantra being laid down as an Instrument in the enlarging of the cake we assume the fact of the master of the sacrifice being magni fied to be the result following from the said enlargement, yet that which is described in the Brāhmaṇa cannot but be regarded as a Praise. Specially as the mantra also, having its use pointed out by the indicative power of its own words, cannot, by itself, point to a Result.
tadaprāptipakṣe ca taṇḍulairupāyāntarāṇyāci pyeran pūraṇe tu sati yā teṣāṃ nivṛttirasāvarthānna vākyāt /	If again the question be taken as referring to the prathana in the Arthavadathe question being just like the question with regard to the Arthavada He wept How when there is no actual weeping, &c., &c. ?in that case too, the reply that is given would be totally incoherent because the mantra being employed by the Adhvaryu priest in the prathana of the cake, the prathana is dis tinctly found to be connected with the cake, and not with the master of the sacrifice.
na ca tadāraṇaṃ niyamaḥ /	But as a matter of fact whichsoever of the two alternatives be accepted, there is no incoherence in the question.
parisaṅkhyā hi tathā syāt / pratyāsannāṃ vāvahantiniyatatāmutsṛjya nānyanivṛttiphalakalpanāvasaraḥ / tatprasaktidvārā tvavahanteraniyatirāsoditi niyamāntargataivārthānnivṛttirgamyate /	Granted that the prathana questioned about is that of the cake we find that the procedure adop ted by some sacrificers is that they employ the mantra in describing the cake, after it has been enlarged and it is one of these sacrificers that puts the question from his own standpointhow is it that one enlarges the cake with the mantra, before the enlargement has been accomplished? And the answer that is given half admits the contention,it being, that on account of its being pointed out by the mantra that is to say, inasmuch as the enlargement, being an already accomplished fact, could not be per formed with the mantra, all that the muntra does is to describe it as an accomplished fact. Or, it may be that in the case of all objects, the operations of the Prompter are always preceded by those of the Prompted and the same must be the case with words also.
na ca prāpte sati vidhirayaṃ pravṛtto yenāsyānyavṛttyarthatā kalpyeta / prāgeva tu pravarttamānenārthasya prāpakaśaktinirodhādanyā prāptiḥ kṛtā sā cārthalabhyeti na tayaiva vyapadiśyate /	On this, the following question is raised No such Injunction is possible because there can be no object of Injunction in this case. If we had any cognition of the action of the Prompter, then alone could it refer to an Injunction but as a matter of fact no action of the Prompted being mentioned, no action of the Prompter can be cognised and hence, as unless the expression should sacrifice has been pronounc ed, we do not make use of the words, he sacrifices, so in the case in question, so long as the prompting words should enlarge have not been uttered, we cannot say he enlarges nor have we any Injunction either in the form that the cake should be enlarged, or that the mantra should be employed in its enlargement and in the absence of such an Injunction, the declaration enlarges must be regarded as an absurdity.
yathātantravārtika / ca gṛhamedhīye pañcame pakṣe /	It is this declaration that is justified in the reply given in the Bhashya on account of its being pointed out by the mantra. That is to say, the Injunction is contained in the Brāhmaṇa words he enlarges, which contain the opening words of the mantra, that express the action of the prompted man.
atrāpi ca na prāpte satyeṣā pravarttate prāpakasya śākhasyānanumitatvātkathaṃ tarhi yadyetadvākyaṃ nābhavivyattata enaṃ prāpsyaditi / sarvasya pratyakṣasya vākyasya nānumānikavākya pratibandhamātraṃ phala miṣyate /	Says the BhashyaHe who utters the words be enlarged enlarges the cake and this simply shows that all that the Adhvaryu priest does is to fulfil the making of the cake. Though another reply that was possible was that the word can very easily accomplish the functions of the Prompter, even without making any mention of the action of the Prompted, whose activity is taken for granted, yet the Bhashya has spoken of the fact of the priority of the mention of this latter, because of the richness of the materials for replying that it had at its command.
kiṃ hi tena paṭhitena yasyānyato 'pyarthaḥ siddhyati tadarthaṃ gaībharaśanānivṛttiḥ phalaṃ kalpyate/	.
tenaivaṃ kalapyate kṛtvācintānyāyena yadi nāmaivaṃ vākyaṃ na bha vettataḥ kīdṛśamanuṣṭhānaṃ syāt / tatra mantraprāptistāvadekāntena siddhyedaśvābhidhānyāṃ tahadeva tu gaībharaśanāyāmapi prasajyeta /	Or, the question may be taken as referring to the enlargement of the master of the sacrifice,the sense of the question being that all Praise having some sort of a basis, either in fact, or in mere words, what sort of a basis has the Praise in question got? And the reply giveu is that the Praise is based upon what is described in the mantra. The assertion that the Adhvaryu priest addresses the mantru to the cake does not refer to the actual enlargement of the cake but what it means is simply that the priest addresses the cake May the master of your sacrifice become magnificent.
yadā tvanena vākyena pratyakṣeṇa nairākāṅacyāda viśeṣa viniyogasamarthavākyānumānaṃ niṣiddhaṃ tadā kevalāśvābhidhānīviṣayatvasidvirityapaunaruktyādarthavadvākyam	The particle iti after prathasva too is used in the sense of etcetera, and not as pointing to the mere word prathasva. The sentenceHe who says become magnificent, &c., means that He who says may your sacrificer be enlarged the meaning of the sentence thus comes to be that one who says may the sacrificer become magnificent thereby actully makes him magnificent this meaning being got a at by means of indirect or figurative indication. Or, the word prathayati may be explained in its direct original sense of speaks of the enlargement and thus it is upon this mention of enlargement that the Praise may be said to be based.
aviruddhaṃ param	Sutra . The Assumption is not incompatible.
dṛṣṭārthoccāraṇavādino 'pi tanniyamādaparamavaśyaṃ kalpanīyamadṛṣṭaṃ tanmamāpi pratyāyananiyamādbhaviṣyatītyavirodhaḥ /	And for one who holds this view, it would be necessary to assume an altogether different transcendental result, that would follow from the particular order of the words in the mantra and inasmuch as we could also assume such a result to follow from the particular signification of the mantra, there can be no incongruity in this assumption. The same reasoning applies to the argument based in the same Sutra upon the fact of only certain sentences being recognised as mantra as apart from other sentences having the same meaning.
etena mantratvādiniyamaḥ pratyuktaḥ /	And hence it is established that the mantras are meant to convey a certain meaning.
satkhapyupāyāntareṣu viśiṣṭānupūrvīkamantra viśeṣāmnānādupāyāntaranivṛttī niyamādṛṣṭamātrakalpa nayā siddhamarthābhidhānam	In reference to the directions relating to the mantras, there can be no objection based upon the reproach. attaching to the action of signification because it serves the purpose of purification. It has been urged under Sutra that, in the case of the sentence Agnid agnid viharētthere can be no significance of the mantra, because in that case it would express only what is expressed in the direction, which would be absurd and that for this reason, the action of signification with regard to the mantra cannot be admisible.
abhivāne 'rthavādaḥ	But this objection is not applicable because the direction in question serves the purposes of purification.
hautre tvayaṃ viṣuvati hoturājye viniyuktaḥ/ tasya cāgneyatvādaścāḍhityadaivatatvasaṃstavāḍhādityarūpeṇāgnistutirupavarṇya ta/	Or, we may explain the clause sanskāryatvāt in the following manner If the comprehension of the mantra had remained permanent, there would be no room for any directions in the case in question however, it is only a slight impression of the former comprehension that remains in the mind and as such there is an occasion for a full manifestation of this impression, SA by means of the idea produced by the said direction and hence the mantra cannot be regarded as meaningless.
tatra catvāri śṛṅgeti divasayāmānāṃ grahaṇam/	The sentence four horns, &c., serves, through a Metaphor, to eulogise the sacrifice and as such serves the purpose of encouraging the sacrificer at the time of the performance.
trayo asya pādā iti śītoṣṇavarṣakālāḥ / dve śīrṣa iti ayanābhiprāyam/	The mantra is employed in regard to the Butter, of the Hotr priest, in connection with the Vishuvat Homa and inasmuch as this Homa is related to Agni, and the Day has the Sun for its Deityit is Agni that is praised in the shape of the Sun.
sapta hastā ityaśvastutiḥ / tridhā baddha iti savanābhiprāyeṇa / vṛṣabha i ti vṛṣṭihetutvena stutiḥ / roravīti stanayitnunā/ sarvalokaprasi tantravārtikam /	Thus then the four horns refer to the four parts of the Day the aree feet to the three seasons, Winter, Summer, and the Rains two heads the two halfyearly periods seven hands is meant as a praise for the seven horses of the Sun thrice bound refers to the three offering times morning, midday, and evening Bull vrshabha serves to eulogise the Sun as the cause of rain vrshti cries roravīti refers to thunder and the Sun, being known to all the world is spoken of as the Great God, who entered into all living beings and the meaning of this is that in serving the purpose of encouraging men He entered into their hearts.
evamanena margeṇāsti tāvaddharmasādhanasmṛtiḥ	In this way then, the mantra is found to serve the purpose of recall ing certain means of accomplishing a certain Dharma.
vidyā'vacanamasaṃyogāt	On account of the expression being figurative, there would be no contradiction.
yadyapi pūrvapace 'yamabhiprāyo nopanyastastathāpi saṃbhava dupanyamyate /	Though the idea combated in this Sutra has not been brought forward in the Purvapaksha, yet, inasmuch as it is quite possible that it may be brought forward, the Sutra offers an explanation of it.
yadi hi svādhyāyakāne 'rthavacanamupayujyeta tatastadāśrīyeta na tvevamasti karmabhira saṃyogāt / tadanabhyāmastu prokṣapādivatmaukaryāt	If, at the time of the study of the Veda, the mention of the meaning were of any use, then it would certainly have been mentioned in the Injunction but as a matter of fact, such is not the case as it bears no connection with the actual perform ance of sacrifices. And as for the getting up of the meanings in the same way as the text is got up, this is not enjoined, because, the ascertain ing of the meaning of a mantra, being like the ordinary acts of wash ing, &c., is a much easier affair than the getting up of the mantra itself.
paraṃ tu śrutisāmānyamātramiti /	Sutra . Moreover, there is an ignorance of really existing meanings.
yajamānastāvatprārthayitā indraśca prārthyamānaḥ sarvadārita/	The means of getting at the meanings of mantras are the following The use of the mantra, the Context, the particular hymn in which it occurs the Deity to whom it refers, the Rshi who propounded it, such explanatory works as Nigama, Nirukta, Vyakarana, and the like. And the only reason why all these are kept up is that they help us in get ting at the true meanings of mantras.

tacca sarvamayajñāṅgabhūtaṃ teṣāṃ karmaṇya pravṛttestadasmākamāharati / śeṣaṃ gatārtham	Then again, we find that, while explaining a certain sentence, people often adopt the plan of speaking of the words as intelligent beings, and then attributing to them certain functions of signification, as when they say this word says this while that word says something else and so forth and also when explaining a discussion, the two opponents are only assumed for the sake of a clear exposition of the two sides of the question exactly of the same kind is the assumption that a certain mantra was propounded by such and such a Ṛshi.
ūhadarśanaṃ na mātā vaīnaityarthye ca puṣṭyādivṛddheḥ pratyakṣatvātpratiṣedhāsaṃbhavādānarthakyāttadaṅgeṣviti śabda vijñāyate /	and the recalling of the name of the Rshi is only with a view to show that the idea expressed is supported by authority. In connection with this, people relate a story to the effect that a certain Rshi, Bhutança by name, in order to conquer old age and death, addressed the Hynns Srnyēva, &c., to the Açwins and as towards the close of the Hymu, we find the words Bhūtānço Çwinōh Kamamapra, this shows that the Hymn was addressed by the Rshi Bhūtānça to the Açwins. And as for the words themselves, Srni those that are driven by the Srni or the goad, viz.

And as such the fact of mantras having certain definite meanings cannot be denied. Sutra . The presence of the mention of transient things has already been explained. That is, under the Sutra Ii.
yā cānyapadavṛddhisadbhāvapratītiriyaṃ ca /	The rest is clear enough. Sutra . The teaching through expressive power shows that the mantra has the same meaning.

But in case of the word, there can be no such growth as fattening, &c. consequently the word growth is taken in the general sense of more material and accordingly the denial is concluded to be that of the Dual and Plural numbers of the word. And such a denial is possible only when the sentence in question has a meaning, which points to the possibility of the mother, &c., of all animals being taken up, as also to the cognition of the presence of the growth of other words. amenable to any law, it is clear that in the case in question, a certain meaning must have been desired to be conveyed by the sentence.
anyathā tu taddṛṣṭamavikṛtaireva sādhyeta /	For otherwise, all the particular transcendental results would follow from the same word without its being in any way modified.

So also in the sentences usrāṇām mēshāṇām, &c., the mention of the various animalswhich are really pointed out by Üha onlycould not but have been with a desire to convey a definite meaning. Otherwise, there would be two distinct transcendental resultsone following from the rejec tion of the original word, and another from the assumption of another.
itarathā prākṛtapadatyāge 'nyakalpane ca dṛṣṭadvayaṃ kalpyeta	So also are the Injunctive words. In the Brahmanas we find certain Injunctions, which very often make mention of the parts of certain mantras by means of synonymous words and this also shows that the mantras express a definite meaning.
arthānāśrayaṇe hi sarvaṃ tadanarthakaṃ syāt /	For if they had no meanings, such Injunctions would be absolutely meaningless.

tantravārtike / dharmasya śabdamūlatvādaśabdamanapekṣaṃ syāt	Sutra . Dharma being based upon the Veda, all that is not Veda is to be disregarded. We have already established the usefulness, with regard to Dharma, of the Veda, consisting of Vidhis direct Injunctions Arthavadas vale dicts passages, and mantras.

And as there can be no discussion with out a concrete example, we take up the Smrtis relating to the Ashtakā, which is mentioned in the works of Manu and others and upon this we pro ceed with the consideration of their authoritativeness or otherwise with re gard to Dharma. P Note. The propriety of introducing this discussion here is explained in various ways We can form no idea of the authority of the Veda, until we have fully understood it in all its bearings and as it is only by the help of the Smrtis and established Usage that it can be so understood, it is only right that the nature of these should be investigated.
tadgandhasamarpitāni pramāṇāpramāṇavicāraviṣayatvenodāhriyante /	The subjectmatter of this Philosophy has been declared to be the Investigation of the nature of Dharma and after the authority for Dharma, in the shape of the Veda has been fully dealt with, it is only right that the nature of its other authorities should be considered.

To explain further As a matter of ordinary experience, we find that all remembrances appear with reference to objects that have been previously cognised by Senseperception, or some other means of cogni tion, and being always similar to this previous cognition, strengthen the idea of the object cognised. Now, we have already proved in the Tarkapada that Senseperception and the other means of right notion do not apply to the notion of the capability of such actions as the Ashtaka and the like, to bring about superphysical results, like Heaven, &c. As for Verbal Authority too, though we find such authority in the Veda for the Agnihotra, &c., we cannot find any texts in support of the Ashtakā and as for the assumption of a Verbal Authority, inasmuch as the object is not cognised by Senseperception, such an assump tion would be a remote and a far more complicated operation than the assumption of a Dharma, without any such authority.
sarvasmaraṇāniddi pratyakṣādyavagate 'rthe tadānurūpyepopajāyatantravārtika /	Nor can Inference help us in the assumption of a Direct Vedic In junction for the Ashtaka because Remembrance is not invariably con comitant with such Direct Injunction nor do we know of anything else that being so concomitant could lead to the Inference thereof. Just as there is no inferential mark to prove the existence of Dharma as hag C been explained in the Tarkapada, Ch.

Nor can we get at such Vedic texts by means of Verbal Authority either eternal or produced because we can have no confidence in any newly produced Verbal Assertion and as for an eternal assertion, no such is possible with regard to the Smrti, which is itself not eternal. Though such texts, being amenable to Auditory perception, may be capable of having their existence supported by human assertions, yet, inasmuch as human assertions are found to abound in deception, we can not have any confidence in them and as such cannot admit of the texts, on the sole authority of these.

Consequently people who have often been put into trouble by deceit ful people naturally have grave doubts as to whether Manu actually found a Vedic text laying down the Ashtaka, &c., and hence declared his Smrti to be based upon the Veda, or that without having found any such text, he only made the declaration, in order to inspire confidence in his assertions.
na hi smṛtistathā vyāptā dṛṣṭā'nyadvānumāpakam /	And the mere fact of there being such a suspicion sets aside the authoritative character of the Smrtis.

The mantra, &c., themselves can never serve as such bases because these are devoid of any direct Injunction nor can they point to any other reasonable basis, because they have other functions to perform. Nor do we find a total accord amongst the many compilers of the Smrtis, themselves and hence on the mere strength of human assertions, we cannot accept the Smrtis to be based upon previously cognised Vedic texts.
na ca vijñāyate vākyaṃ kohaśata nirūpitam /	Nor do we know what sort of Vedic text these authors really came across we find that by the Arthavada and other such supplementary texts, many people have been led astray e.g., the author of the Kalpasutras, Vide Adh.
arthavādādirūpāddhi paśyāmo bhrāmyato bahūn upamānaṃ tvadṛṣṭe 'rthe sahaśe cānirūpite /	That is to say, if we were absolutely certain that Manu had actually found Vedic texts in the proper form of Direct Injunctions, then the said assumption would have been possible but as a matter of fact, even at the present day we find many people being led astray, by the Arthavada passages, which have entirely different significations but are mistaken as being Direct Injunctions.
naiveṣṭamiti tenāpi na mūlaśrutisādhanam	For these reasons we conclude that Vedic support for the Ashtakā is not cognisable by Verbal Authority.

If the Smrtis Remembrances were not possible without an assumption of the Veda, then alone could they be accepted as having a right basis through Apparent Inconsistency but as a matter of fact, Remembrance is often found to be based upon such untrust worthy sources as Dreams, &c.
tasmādanupalabdhigocarāpannāryā śrutau satkhapi mṛjāntareṣvabhipretamūlābhāvānnirmūlatvābhidhānam/	hence finding the ground of the said In . consistency not absolutely true, either Apparent Inconsistency or Inference cannot be rightly brought forward as giving rise to an idea of Vedic support for the Smrtis. Thus then such Vedic texts being found to be amenable to Negation only i.e., being found to be nonexisting, though there may be other sources or supports for the Smrtis, yet inasmuch as we do not find such support as we should like to have, we conclude them to be absolutely baseless and devoid of authority.

And the meaning of this is that those who who know a certain action as fit to be done in a certain manner, and as leading to a particular result,or simply those who know the action as capable of being performed,knowing this, how could they, only for deluding us say that it ought not to be done? Though it may be urged that one declares it as fit to be done may be different from one who declares it to be unfit,yet, how is this difference possible ? For, in any case, we have a due comprehension of the Smrti, only when we know that the pro pounder knew and remembered it thus the two factors belonging to On the one and the same person.
atha vā ye manvādayo vidurakarttavyo 'yaṃ padārtha iti / kathamiva te vināparādhena lokaṃ vaccayituṃ vadiṣyanti karttavya evāyamiti /	Or, the passage in the Bhashya may be better explained thus If Manu and others, knew a certain action f.i., the Ashtaka as not fit for being performed, how could they declare it to be fit for being performed, and thereby lead astray the people of the present day, who have done them no harm ? Says the Bhashya in reply to this intermediate objection Because of the impossibility of remembrance.
manvādīnāmapi yadi prathamaṃ kiṃ citpramāṇaṃ sambhāvyate tataḥ smaraṇaṃ bhavennānyathā /	The notion of Ashtaka that the people later than Manu have cannot be said to be a Remembrance, because they have never cognised it before so, in the case of Manu also, if any means of recognising it previously were possible, then there could be a remembrance of it and not otherwise but we have already shown that none of the recognised means of right notion is applicable to the case and hence we conclude that no remembrance was possible even for Manu.
kasmātpunaḥ putraṃ duhitaraṃ vātikrasya vandhyādauhitroḍhāharaṇaṃ kṛtam /	A barren woman may declare that a certain thing was done by her grandson and then subsequently recalling the fact that she had no daughter, she could never believe her former assertion to be true and to this an objection is raised How is it that the Bha shya has left off the Son or the Daughter, and cited the Grandson as an example? The reason for this is the similarity of positions.
putrādisthānīyaṃ hi manvādeḥ pūrvavijñānaṃ dauhitrasthānīyaṃ smaraṇamataśca yathā duhiturabhāvaṃ parāmṛgya dauhitrasmṛtiṃ bhrāntiṃ manyate tathā manvādibhiḥ pratyakṣādyasambhavaparāmarśadaṣṭakādismaraṇaṃ mithyeti mantavyam/	That is to say, Manu stands in the place of the Father, his previous cognition. stands in the place of the Son or the Daughter, and his remembrance stands in the position of the Grandson hence the sense of the Instance is that just as the woman having thought of the absence of the Daugh ter, concludes her remembrance of her grandchild to be a mistake,so, in the same manner, Manu could conclude his remembrance of the performability of the Ashtaka to be a mistake, when he would find that it could never be cognisable by Senseperception or any other means of right notion and as such there could be no incongruity in the fact of his having, under a misconception, laid down the Ashtakā.
yathaiva pāramparyeṇāvicchedādayaṃ veda iti vākyānumānābhiprāyeṇoktam /	Says the Bhashya in answer to the above arguments ‘Just as there being an unbroken remembrance with regard to the Veda it is considered authoritative, so could the same ground be urged in favour of the Smrtis.
vedaḥ punaḥ saviśeṣaḥ pratyakṣagamyastatra ghaṭādivadeva puruṣāntarasthamupalabhya smaranti tairapi smṛtamupalabhyānyepi smaranto 'nyebhyastathaiva samarpayantītyanāditā /	The case of the Veda is entirely different from that of the Smṛtis it is amenable to direct Senseperception and hence having by its means cognised its existence in another person, exactly as one would cognise the existence of the jar at a certain place, people learn it from him, and then remember it and others cognising it as thus remembered, get it up in their turn, and give it to others, who go on doing the same and so the process has gone on eternally and as the remembrance of every individual is preceded by a rightful cognition of it, there is no want of proper basis in this case.
prāgapi hi vedaśabdādanyavastu vilakṣaṇaṃ vedāntaravilakṣaṇaṃ vādhyeṭasthamṛgveḍhādirūpaṃ mantrabrāhmaṇādirūpāṇi cānyavilacaṇānyupalabhyante /	the usage of experienced people, is the fact that the texts thus learnt and remembered are named Veda but even prior to the recognition of the name, people directly perceive it to be something entirely different in character from other things, and in the case of a particular Veda as being learnt by a particular student different from the other Vedas, in the form of the Rgveda for instance as consisting of mantras and Brāhmaṇas different from all other things.
sarveṣāṃ cānādayaḥ saṃjñā iti taddāraṇottarakālamapi ga myamānānāṃ pratyakṣatvaṃ sādhitam /	The names of all these are eternal and by means of these, whenever, subsequently, they come to be cognised, they are cognised by direct Senseperception, as we have already proved.

If it be the mere form of the Ashtaka that was remembered by Manu, then other people would also have re . membered it, on having seen it with their eyes, like the ordinary action of cooking, as being performed by others.
nāsaiau puruṣāntareṣūtpadyamānaḥ kaiścidṛśyataityandhaparamparānyāyenāpramāṇatā/ sarvasyānādivyavahāropanyāsena vedavatprasiddhyabhimāno bhavatyato 'ndhaparamparā nidarśanam /	But it is the causal potentiality of the Ashtakā towards leading the agent to Heaven, that is said to be remembered and is laid down as such by Manu but no such capability of proceeding to Heaven is seen to appear in another person by the performance of the Ashtakā and as such we conclude the traditional assertion of such causal potentiality of the Ashtaka to be like the description of a certain colour handed down by one blind person to another. Such a rude simile has been brought forward, because people are impudent enough to attribute Vedalike eternality to all such asser tions, on the ground of an assumed eternality of usage.
prāmāṇyasyānāditvamihāprāmāṇyasya / katham	Though as a matter of fact, in the Veda, we have an eternality of faithfulness and authoritativeness while, in the case in question, we have an eternality of falsity and inauthoritativeness.
tādṛśaṃ vāṣṭakādismaraṇam/	Exactly similar is the case with the remembrance of the Ashtaka.
na ca codanā mūlabhūtopalabhyate / na cānanubhūtasambandhā 'numātuṃ śakyate /	That is to say, we do not find any Vedic Injunction on which it is based nor can any such Injunction be inferred, when it has not had any of its relations cognised by Senseperception.
yadi ca vedādupattabhya smṛtayaḥ pravarttitāḥ syuḥ tatorthammaraṇavadita upalabhyāyaṃ manvādibhiḥ praṇīta ityapi pāramparyeṇa smaryeta /	If the Smrtis had been invariably propounded, on the basis of certain Vedic Injunctions. that had been found by the Authors, then such Injunctions would also have been handed down to us,exactly as the subjectmatter is said AN to be by means of the Smrtisbeing pointed out as the source from which Manu and others got their compilations. It may be urged that the people of old were fully satisfied with re membering the sense, and having thus neglected the original text, this became lost through negligence.
tadayuktam / na hi yatkṛtaṃ prāmāṇyaṃ tadeva vismattuṃ yujyate /	But this is not right because it is not possible that people should forget that upon which rests the authority of the sense as the remembrance of the sense has no selfsufficient authority like the Veda.
sarve puruṣāstāvadetajjānanti yathā vedamūnajñānādinā prāmāṇyaṃ na niścīyataiti / te kathamiva tatrānādaraṃ kuryyaḥ /	All men are cognisant of the fact, that in such cases, nothing can be accepted as authoritative, until its source is found in the Veda how, then, could they forget it so completely ? Then again, how is it that Manu and others did not make the same efforts to hand down the original Vedic Injunctions, as they did in propounding their own compilations ? If even those Authors only knew the sense, and had not found the original Veda, then we could put the above question to their predecessors and thus the tradition being found, at each step, to be without a basis in the Veda, you would not become free from the charge of your Smrtis being absolutely baseless.
yadi tu pratīnaśākhāmūnatā kalpyeta tataḥ sarvāsāṃ buddhādimṛtīnāmapi taddāraṃ prāmāṇyaṃ prasajyate /	If it be assumed that they have a basis in the portions of the Veda, that have become lost, then the authority of the Smrtis of the Bauddhas could also be established, by means of a similar assumption. And people would be utilising the authority of such assumed Vedic texts now lost, in support of anything they might wish to assert.

K And, as a matter of fact, we find that, in the dark, however much a person may try with his hand, he can never distinguish white or black which could be done by by the eye alone and in the same manner the fact of the Ashtaka being enjoined in the Veda cannot be accepted un less we actually find the Vedic Injunction in support of it.
kīdṛśāḍākyādidaṃ manvādibhiḥ pratipannaṃ kiṃ vidhiparādutārthavādarūpāditi /	Nor can we be convinced of its being based upon the Veda, by the declarations of Manu himself as that the whole Veda is the source of Dharma and so forth because it is just possible that he never found any Vedic texts, and made these declarations, simply with a view to delude the people..
paśya	Sutra .
na ca manvādivacanādvedamūlatvaṃ niścinumaḥ / te hi nirmūlamapi viprannambhādihetorutkā lokaṃ vañcayitumevaṃ vadeyuḥ /	But on account of the agent being the same, the fact could be established by reasoning Anumana. As a matter of fact, we find that the Smrtis have been compiled by Manu and others in a correct manner, unlike the compilations of the Bauddhas, and also that the fourteen Sciences Purana, &c., similarly compiled, give very correct explanations of their respective subjects. Consequently, inas much as these Authors themselves are not to be met with now and what they say is well said and as such cannot be without some sound basis, it becomes necessary to assume a certain unseen basis for their cognitions.
tasmādapramāṇam	This last is the most reasonable assumption, as it is this alone that is in keeping with actual facts viz.
sarvacaiva cādṛṣṭakalpanāyāṃ tādṛśaṃ kalpayitavyaṃ yaddṛṣṭaṃ na viruṇaddhi na vādṛṣṭāntaramā sañjayati /	That is to say, when it becomes necessary to make assump tions of the unseen, we must try, as far as possible, to make only such as sumptions as are not contrary to directly perceptible facts, and do not, in their turn, necessitate the assumption of other unseen facts.

puruṣavākyaparamparāpi andhaparamparayā nirākṛtā / na hi niṣpratiṣṭhapramāṇātmalābho dṛśyate /	As for the assumption that these assertions are based upon those of other persons, this has already been set aside in the preceding Sūtra, as resembling a description of colour handed down by blind men nor does any such baseless tradition ev ever attain any authority.

Then again, this assumption would mean the denying of the authority of the firm conviction of the teaching, of Manu being true and this would be a contradiction of a directly perceptible fact.
tasmātmavebhyaścodanā kalpanaiva jyāyasī /	Therefore it must be admitted that, instead of these, it is far more reasonable to assume a direct Vedic Injunction upon which the asser tions of Manu are based.
tatra hi tanmātrādaṣṭābhyupagamaḥ / śeṣāstu mahājanaparigrahādayaḥ sarve 'nuvidhīyante /	In this case, we have to assume only one unseen fact the existence of such an Injunction in the Veda and it is only with this assumption that all other facts of the acceptance of the Smrtis by the great and the learned become reconciled.
saṃbhāvyate ca manvādīnāṃ codanāpūrvavijñānakāraṇatvena /	And in the case of Manu, it is quite possible that there should be Vedic Injunctions that served as the source of his conceptions.
tadarthamevāha tenopapanno vedasaṃyogastraivarṇikānāmiti /	It is this that is meant by the Bhashya passage,For this reason, it becomes possible for the three higher castes, to be connected with the Veda.

In the case of the Brahmāna, &c., where there is every possibility of the Veda supplying the source sought after, all other sources being thereby set aside, there is no chance of the assertions being baseless and as such we cannot but admit the source of these to lie in the Veda itself.
yattu kimarthaṃ codanā nopalabhyantaiti / tatra ke cidāhuḥ / nityānumeyāstā na kadā ciduḥccāryyante /	Then, there is the questionHow is it that this Vedic Injunction of the Ashtaka is not found? To this, some people make the following reply Such Vedic Injunc tions are always to be inferred they are never directly mentioned exactly like those injunctions that are assumed on the strength of the implication of certain mantras e.g., the mantra I cut the grass, the seat of the gods is accepted as pointing to the assumed injunction that this n mantra should be recited at the cutting of the grass.
yathāliṅgādikalpitāḥ / kathamanuccāritānāṃ mūlatvopapattiriti cet /	basis, yet that cannot affect our position because, the fact of such In junction being the source is established by an unbroken remembrance, which is as unbroken as the handing down of the Vedic text itself.
pāṭhāvicchedavatpāramparyeṇa smaraṇāttatmidveḥ yathaiva hi granthaḥ saṃpradāyādavicchinno 'stitvaṃ bhajate tathaiva pratijñayānityānumeyaśrutisaṃpradāyāvicchedasiddhiḥ /	Just as in the case of the text of the Veda, it is accepted as existing in its original form, only on the ground of its having been handed down by an unbroken line of teachers, so too in the case in question, we can establish an unbroken line of such Vedic Injunctions, as are inferred through the Apparent Inconsistency of the declaration of the remembrance of the Ash takā i.e., by all teachers of the old times, one after the other. But this explanation is not quite satisfactory because the tradition has already been spoken of as resembling the description of colour handed down by blind men.
yā hi codanā na kadāciduccāryyate tasyāḥ sarvapuruṣapratyacādiprasarābhāvāddarlabhataramastitvam/	As for the Vedic Injunction that is never uttered, as this can never be cognisable by any means of right notion, it is scarcely possible to prove its existence and thereby the Smrti comes to resemble the grand child of the barren woman as urged under the last Sutra.
liṅgādīnāṃ tu nityatvānnityamanucaritaśrutyanumāna kāra ṇatvamaviruddham /	As for the as sumption of Vedic Injunctions on the strength of the implications of the mantras, these latter are eternal, and as such there is nothing contradictory in their having the eternal potentiality of pointing to the existence of Vedic Injunctions whereas in the case of the Smrtis, they themselves stand in need of the basic Vedic Injunction, and as such cannot rightly be made the means of inferring nonuttered injunctions.
tena varaṃ pralonaśrutyanumānameva / na ca pralayo na saṃbhāvyate / dṛśyate hi pramādālasyādibhiḥ puruṣacayāccālpaviṣayatvam /	For these reasons, it would be far more reasonable to assume the Smrtis to have their source in the Injunctions contained in such portions of the Veda as have been lost nor is such disappearance of the Veda impossible, as even now we find the Veda losing much of itself, either through the negligence or laziness of the students, or through the gradual disappearance of people versed in it.
na caivaṃ sati yatkiṃ citpramāṇamāpatsyate / śiṣṭacaivarṇikatantravārtika / dṛḍhasmaraṇānyathānupapattilabhyatvācchrutyanumānasya /	It cannot be urged that any and every theory could declare itself to be based upon such authority because such lost Vedic texts can be assumed only on the ground that without such texts, the firm conviction and remembrance of highly respectable people of the three higher castes remain inexplicable.
yahā vidyamānaśākhāgata śrutimūlatvamevāstu /	C Or, we may hold that the Smrtis are based upon texts contained in the very portions of the Veda that are available nowadays.
kathamanupalabdhiriti ceducyate yattu kimarthaṃ vedavākyānyeva nopasaṃgṛhītānīti / saṃpradāyavi nābhabhoteḥ /	If it ke questionedhow is it that they are not found ?we make the following reply Because of the various branches of the Veda being scattered because of the negligence of the people learning it and because of the texts being contained in diverse sections of the Veda we fail to actually lay our hands upon those texts that form the basis of the Smrtis. There has been a further question Why then were these Vedic texts themselves not collected together? And the reply to this is that this was not done, for fearing of destroy ing the natural order of the text of the Veda.
viśiṣṭānupūrvyāvyavasthito hi svādhyāyo 'dhyetavyaḥ śrūyate /	It is only a fixed order of the verbal text of the Veda the study of which has been enjoined. And as for the rules of conduct dealt with in the Smrtis, these are scattered about here and there, in various branches, chapters and sections of the Veda.
tatrāpi tu ke citpuruṣamevādhikṛtyāmnāyante / yena ṛtuprakaraṇāmnātāḥ kena cinnimittanotkṛṣyamāṇāḥ puruṣadhamatāṃ bhajante / yathā malavadvāsasā saha na saṃvadettasmānna brāhmaṇāyāvagurodityevamādayaḥ /	And of these as appearing in the Veda, some actions are laid down with direct reference to human agents, while some are such as are laid down in connection with the various sacrifices, but are, for some reason or other, explained as referring to the human agent also as for example, we have such prohibitive injunctions as One should not talk to his wife if she be, &c., One should not threaten a Brahmana. These occur in the section on the DarçaPurnamāsa sacri fice and as in connection with this sacrifice, it has already been laid down once before that if the sacrificers wife happen to be in a certain condition, she is not to be present at the sacrifice, the prohibition of any conversation with her becomes absolutely irrelevant, if taken as applying to the sacrifice and for this reason it is explained as a general rule of conduct, to be observed in ordinary intercourse. The same is the case with the threatening of the Brahmana.
tatra yadi tāvattānyeva vākyānyuddhṛtyādhyāpayeyustataḥ kramānyatvātsvādhyāyavidhivirodhaḥ syāt / anena ca nirdeśena anye 'pyarthavādodvāreṇa vidhimātramadhīyoran kopayikamātraṃ vā /	And if Manu went about extracting only such texts as bear upon the general conduct of men, and teaching these separately, then as the natural order of the Veda would be disturbed, he would be directly going against the injunction of the study of the text of the Veda. And on the strength of this example set by Manu, people might leave off the Artha vada portions as useless and read only the Vidhi portions of the Veda, or only such portions of it as would be of help in the performance of the sacrifices and thereby the Veda itself would gradually disappear.
na cāvaśyaṃ manvādayaḥ sarvaśākhādhyāyinaḥ /	Then again, Manu himself could not necessarily have studied all the branches of all the Vedas and as such he could not always lay his hands upon all Vedic texts.
te hi prayatnena śākhāntarādhyāyibhyaḥ śrutvārthamātraṃ svavākyaira vismaraṇārthaṃ nivanīyuḥ /	What he must have done was to try and find out the texts from various students of the different branches, and then to have kept in mind the meaning of these texts, which he must have em bodied in his compilation.
na ca vākyaviśeṣo jñāyate/ yathaiva hi smṛterdṛḍhatvāddhāntimūlatvaṃ nāstyevamarthavādamūlatvamapi /	G t Nor can it be reasonably urged as has been done in the Purvapaksha that, we do not quite know whether the texts on which Manu based his rule were in the form of a Direct Injunction, or only in that of Artha vadas because just as the firmness of the conviction in the Smrti precludes the fact of its being based upon a misconception, so would it also preclude the chance of its being based upon an Arthavada passage.

Hence we conclude that the Smrtis have their authority through the Veda itself.

But their argument becomes too wide, when we refer to such actions as are performed by the same people under the influence of some temporary impulse which actions too would come to be equally authorised and further, if the Smrtis be held to be proved selfauthoritative, then such an argument would be directly contradicted by the apparent fact of many Smrti Injunctions having their source in Direct Vedic Injunctions that are easily accessible.
tasmādarthāpattirevācāvyabhicārādupacārāt paścānmānādanumānatvenoktā asyā eva smṛterbrūḍhimnaiti /	For these reasons, we must admit Apparent In consistency alone, as has been mentioned in the Sutras, as establishing the fact of the Smrtis having their source in the Veda as there are no in superable objections to this and Apparent Inconsistency can also be called Anumana, inasmuch as it gives rise to cognition, after or in the wake ofanuSenseperception mana.
dṛḍhatvātkāraṇānumānamatha vā dṛḍhatvasya /	authoritative, or having its source in the Veda this argument being expanded into the following form The Smrtis are authoritative, because the persons that per form the acts laid down in them are the same as those that perform those laid down in Smrti in the Veda from the firmness of its conviction and remem brance or as we shall infer the source of this firmness of its convic tion to lie in the Veda.

The Bhashya saysBecause of the fact of the performer of the acts laid down in the Smrtis being the same as that of those enjoined in the Veda, it is possible that the three higher classes should have found the requisite Vedic texts and this is said only in order to show that it is possible for a Direct Vedic Injunction to be the source of that contained in the Smrti. Says the BhashyaIt is possible that they the Vedic texts may have been forgotten.

yaḍhātu śākhāntareṣu vidyantaeva tāḥ yastadāpi kasyāṃ śākhāyāṃ kāḥ padyantaiti syāṃśasya vismaraṇam /	Even when the requisite texts had existed in other branches of the Veda, it is possible that at the time that the Smrti was being compiled it may have been forgotten in which parti cular branch the particular text was to be found and this may have been the reason why Manu did not mention the corroborative texts though he only carefully cherished the fact of his assertion being authoritative as based upon the Veda and as for the direct recognition of such basic text, he did not consider it of much use, and so let it drop off.

We have not taken upon ourselves the task of establishing the authority of all actions as it is only the desire to know the nature of Dharma that is our sole purpose.

na ca niyogataḥ śāstrāta prāptiḥ / śakyate chupāyāntareṇāpi sāmadānādinā gururadhyāpanādīni kārayitum /	Nor again can the injunction the teacher should be attended upon be said to have the visible end of propitiating the Teacher who as the Bhashya says, thus propitiated, would teach well, and explain satisfactorily all the knotty points of the scriptures because there is no such hard and fast rule as that without obeying the teacher the scriptures cannot be learnt as we do find the Teacher being induced to teach, by means of requests and remonstrances.

sarvatra ca yathā kathaṃ cillokapakimahāyopāḍhānātmarakṣaṇaprītyutpādādikā ṭārthatā bhāṣyakāroktā śakyā vaktum /	And as for the fact of the visible use, in the case of all actions Vedic as well as worldly we can always point out in the way that the Bhashya has done, some visible purpose or other, in the shape of acquiring a Kings assistance, protection of ones self, acquiring of some form of pleasure and the like.
na cāvaghātādīnāṃ vṛṣṭikāmayāgādīnāṃ ca dṛṣṭārthānāmavaidikatvam /	As even in the case of such actions as the threshing of the corn, and the Kārīrī sacrifice which are laid down in the Veda, the fact of their having visible purposes does not make them devoid of Vedic authority.

And it is only when we accept this attendance upon the Teacher to have both visible and invisible results, that the discussionas to whether such attendance is to be performed only once or over and over again, as propounded in Sutra , of the second Päda of Adhyaya VIcan be possible.
dṛṣṭaṃ ca prīto gururadhyāpayiṣyatītyevamādi niṣyadyate /	and if the action had only a visible result, there could be no question or doubt as to whether it should be repeated or not as in that case it would be like the action of drinking water and as in the case of this latter, people raise no questions, but conclude that the drinking is to be repeated whenever one feels thirsty so too in the case of the action of attendance, people would conclude that as it has only a visible result, we may repeat it whenever we may want the particular visible result and as such there could be no doubt on the point, and hence no ground for the aforesaid discussion.

Though we do not assume any particular Vedic texts with regard to the establishing of Assembly Rooms and the founding of water drinking stations, yet all such philanthropic deeds become included in the Vedic text that enjoins the doing of good to others as a duty and it is from this general Vedic Injunction that such actions derive their authority.

It is laid down in the Smrtis that one should have his Çikha lock of hair on the head done up in a definite way, in order to serve as a mark for the particular class of Rshis from whom he is descended. hence the authority of this Injunction cannot be lield to rest upon the said visible result alone for certainly, there are many other means by which the particular class of Rshis could be indicated.

And it is this in order to regulate the number of avattas offerings at sacrifices which is in accordance with the Gotra of each priest, it is absolutely necessary that the name of the Gotra should be distinctly marked and in this Vedic fact would lie the foundation of the Smrti Injunction of arranging the Çikha in a definite way and as for the restriction of this particular means, as we cannot find out any other reason, we are obliged to assume that this parti cular method would produce a certain effect upon the man himself.

The descriptions of the state of things to be in the future as recounted in the Puranas serve the purpose of pointing out the nature of the various periods of eternallyrevolving time, and also the variegated character of the results of righteous and unrighteous conduct and these have their origin in the Veda itself. W Among the Auxiliary Sciences too, there are certain portions that treat of things that are of use in sacrifices, and these have their origin in the Veda, while other parts treat of such as are useful only in the serving of some visible worldly purpose and these have their basis upon ordinary experience. In the Çiksha, the differentiations of the organs of pronuncia tion of letters, their accents and time, &c., have their perceptible uses while the assertion, that if a sacrifice is performed with a full knowledge. of these details, there follows a particular resulte.g.

S The same may be said also of the science of Reasoning. The meaning of Vedic passages is expressed by means of the meanings of words but in ordinary usage, the denotation of words is found to be mixed up with the several factors of Class Property, Action, and Name and these can be directly discriminated, never by themselves, but only by means of Sense perception and the rest, as distinguished by their respective character istics, and as put forward by their learned expounders.

If it were not for such systematic argumentations, various arguments would be appearing to people at random, and would be giving rise to all sorts of misconceptions, through sheer ignorance of the various phases of the question.
na hi kaścidapi prathamametāvantaṃ yuktikalāpamupasaṃdattuṃ kṣamaḥ /	Otherwise such people as have not comprehended the arguments in favour of one or the other of the aforesaid factors of Generality, Speciality, and the like, could not, by mere personal observation, ascertain any definite factor of an object, as denoted by a particular word.

Thus then, all the Smrtis, as well as all Auxiliary Sciences, have been proved to be authoritative. In the case of such results as are to fol low at a distant point of time, no personal experience can be found to serve as its basis and consequently in all such cases we infer the basis to lie in the Veda itself.
tipattimukhapradarśanam / tadupapattayasta ilā balapūrvakaṃ ca niścayadvāraṃ kathyate / anyathā punaḥ	While in the cases of directly perceptible results, as in the case of the curing of scorpionbites by means of incantations, we actually observe it to be true in the case of other people, and thence come to the conclusion that the science of such treatment cannot but be true and authoritative.

The authoritativeness of the Smrti has been established in a general way and as such authoritativeness belong to all sorts of Smrtis, the author now proceeds to lay down exceptions to the general authoritativeness established before, with special reference to the case of such Smrtis as are found to be directly contradictory to universallyaccepted Vedic texts. Whenever there is any such contradiction, the authority of the Smrtis is to be totally disregarded as it is only when there is no such con tradiction that we have an inference of a Vedic text in support of the particular Smrti injunction.

When two notions are found to present two contradictory ideas with regard to one and the same object, they are said to contradict one another and the question, as to which of the two is to be accepted to the preclusion of another, is decided accord ing to their comparative strength or authority. Under such cir cumstances, when we come to suspect a certain Smrti injunction of being contradictory to a direct Vedic Injunction, it is just possible that the suspected contradiction could be explained and set aside, by show ing that the two do not exactly refer to the same subject or even when they do treat of the same subject, as there would be no contradiction, if one could be explained as a General Injunction, and the other as the prohibition of a particular phase of it, the two texts could be accepted. side by side specially as in another case where the particular prohibi tion would not be applicable, both of them could be found to be equally applicable, and as such they could both be accepted as optional alter natives, both equally authoritative and thus there would be no absolute contradiction between the two texts. And secondly, the idea brought about by the Vedic text assumed in support of the particular Smrti text being Vedic in its character, as that produced by a direct Vedic Injunction, and thereby both being equally strong in their authority, both the texts could be accepted as equally authoritative.
tato yathopanyastaviṣaye'pi smṛtiprāmāprathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	And consequently, with reference to the particular subject, the authority of the Smrti could not be absolutely disregarded.

And as for the Vedic text that is assumed or inferred, and that which is directly laid down in the Veda, there is a vast difference in the authority of the two, as much as there is between ordinary Senseperception and Inference. Consequently, then, there being no chance of both being accepted side by side, we cannot but totally disregard the authority of the Smrti, in contradis tinction to the direct Vedic Injunction which has been shown to possess a much higher authority. The conclusion that presents itself at first is in this form Even when there is a contradiction, the authority of the Smrti cannot be denied because if the Smrti be once held to be unauthoritative, it would be a sad en croachment.

In matters relating to the performance of Dharma, we are always able to assert the unfeigned authority of such Smrtis as have been found to be based upon. Direct Vedic Injunctions and with regard to these all suspicions of their origin lying in Deception or Illusion have been set aside.

ataścaivaṃjātāśakannaiva ka cidapi viśvasyeta aviśvāsācātyantameva prāmāṇyaṃ pratihamyeta /	? Consequently people having their suspicions once aroused could not come to have any confidence in any Smrti Injunc tion and this want of confidence would deprive the Smrti of even the slightest shade of authority.
tathā hi	And further, if there were no contradictions among the Vedic texts.

smṛteḥ śrutivirudvāyāstato mūlāntaraṃ bhavet	The Veda is not addressed to any one person IIiv and also because the Smrti is as good a means of ascertaining the Vedic texts, as a study of the Veda itself.
tasmādyathā virodhe 'pi padyamānapramāṇatā / paṭhitasmaryyamāṇānāṃ tathaivetyavadhāryyatām	Therefore, just as you accept the authority of even such Vedic texts as are mutually contradictory, in the same manner, you should also accept the authority of the Vedic and Smrti texts, that may be found to contradict one another. PO Then again, from what you say, it would seem that when there is no contradiction of the Veda, the Smrti has its foundation in the Veda while, when there is a contradiction, it has its foundation elsewhere in Illusion, &c.
mūlāntaraṃ nirastaṃ ca sāmānyenaiva yatpurā /	For if even the slightest chance of other sources as that of Illusion and the like be introduced, all hope for any authority of the Smrti might well be given up.

Therefore, whether the Smrtis be authoritative or not, this authoritativeness or its contrary must be accepted as absolute ly undisputed and there can be no half and half authority and absence.
viruddhatvaṃ ca jānanti smartārastāḥ smaranti yat / vedamūnnabalaṃ tyaklā kimanyattatra kāraṇam	And certainly the authors who compiled the Smrtis must have been cognisant of the fact of certain declarations therein contained being con tradictory to the direct assertions of the Veda and this clearly leads to the conclusion that they must have braved this contradiction, only on the strength of certain other Vedic texts, on which they based their declarations.
rāgadveṣamadonmādapramādālasyalubdhatāḥ /	For instance, such grounds of the alleged unauthoritativeness of the Smrtis, as the presence of the motives of affection, aversion, vanity, recklessness, delusion, laziness, avarice, and the like, are capable of being attributed to all actions Vedic as well as nonVedic.
kva vā notpredituṃ śakyāḥ smṛtyaprāmāṇya hetavaḥ	So long as our own minds are pure and devoid of all wickedness, we can always admit the Smrtis to have a sound basis in the Veda and it is only when our own minds become tainted that we begin to suspect their authoritative character.
kā vā dharmmakriyā yasyāṃ dṛṣṭo hetuna yujyate /	What performance of Dharma is there, in which some sort of a perceptible motive cannot be found, and which cannot be found to be contradictory to some other Direct Vedic Assertions ? The chances of contradiction are equally present in all Injunctions, whether the action laid down be found to have a perceptible motive or not.
vaidikānyapi karmāṇi dṛṣṭārthānyeva te viduḥ / alpenāpi nimittena virodhaṃ yojayanti ca	And then again, the terribly ignorant Atheists have no other business except find ing some sort of a worldly motive for all actions, even those that are not due to any apparent perceptible worldly motive. Even the actions. laid down in the Veda are made by them to be due to certain worldly motives and on the slightest grounds they explain one Vedic Injunction to be contradictory to other Vedic texts.
nābhidravanti te tāvatpiśācā vā svagocare	Because these Atheists do not trouble their objectives until these latter M themselves give them an opportunity of attack.
tasmāllokāyatasthānāṃ dharmanāśanaśālinām /	You have in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa accepted the authority of Puranas, Smrtis, Crutis, and Usage, at first by mere faith and then you have proved, by means of arguments, that the authority of these, as pointed.
evaṃ mīmāṃsakaiḥ kāryyaṃ na manorathapūraṇam	out in the scriptures, is quite sound you should stick to this conclu sion by all means, and not slacken your faith midway because such slackening would lead to the destruction of the whole fabric of the the authoritativeness of Smrtis as proved in foregoing Adhikarana exactly like a cart, whose fastenings have become loosened.
tattathaivānumantavyaṃ karttavyaṃ nāntarā latham /	Then again, if the Veda itself were not found to lay down certain actions, that have worldly motives, and some that are contradictory to other Vedic texts, then alone could these two facts be rightly turned to account to prove that the Smrtis that lay down such actions can have no foundation in the Veda.
savai lathayataḥ moded durbraddaśakaṭādivat vedaśca yadi dṛṣṭārthaṃ śrayamāṇavirodhi vā /	As a matter of fact, however, we find the Veda laying down thousands of such actions as Threshing, Pounding, and the like, which have only visible results and then what is the harm if such results are also found to apply in the case of actions laid down by the Smrtis? There are also other actions laid down in the Veda, which have only visible results and which can be attributed to motives.
ṛtvigbhyo dakṣiṇādānaṃ tānūnaprādikarmma ca /	of avarice, &c., such as, the giving of the gifts to the priests, and the sacrificers action with regard to the Tanūnaptra butter.
tadā kiṃ nāma dṛṣṭārthaṃ buddhyā siddhyedavaidikam /	Under the circumstances, if these actions be said to be not based upon the authority of the Veda because of their having visible results, then, in that case alone could the Smrtis laying down similar actions be also denied the support of the Veda. C to direct Vedic Injunctions, yet no sound arguments can rightly be brought forward to shake their authoritativeness.
tenādāveva yā klṛptā smārttānāṃ vedamūlatā tasmādedavirudvānāṃ dṛṣṭārthānāṃ ca hetubhiḥ / smṛtīnāṃ na pramāṇatvaṃ vihantavyaṃ manāgapi	To the above arguments, we make the following reply All authority of the Smrti becomes inadmissible, when it is found to be contradictory to Vedic Assertions and it is only when there is no such contradic tion that the Veda affords an inferred basis for the authority of the Smrti. Those Smrti passages that we find to be in direct contradiction to the Veda must have their origin in Ignorance, &c., and can never be admitted to have any foundation in the Veda itself.
avirodhe hi vedena tanmūlamanumoyate svātantryeṇa pramāṇatvaṃ smṛtestāvanna sammatam /	In the case of the Smrti we do not admit of a selfsufficient authority and as for its authority being based upon the Veda, this is found to be con trary to the perceptible fact of its being contradictory to the Veda.
pratyaśce śrūyamāṇe tu na vidyetānumānikama / nahi hastini dṛṣṭe 'pi tatpadenānumiṣyate	We can assume a Vedic passage in support of a Smrti only so long as we do not find a direct Vedic text bearing upon the same subject and when such a text is found and found to be contradictory to the assertion of the Smrti, then we can never allow of an assumption of any other Vedic texts in support of this latter for certainly, when we actually see the elephant passing before us, we do not seek to infer its existence by means of its footprints.
tāvadeva spharantyarthāḥ purastādānumānikāḥ / yāvatpratyakṣa śāstreṇa mūtrameṣāṃ na kṛntyate	And Smrtis are the means of leading us to the inference of Vedic texts, exactly as the footprints lead to the inference of the elephant consequently when this efficiency of the Smrti is found to be contrary to a direct Vedic text, its efficiency to lead to the assump tion of a Vedic text is set aside exactly as in the case of the elephant.
na hi sāścātpramāṇatvaṃ smṛtīnāmupapadyate /	And Smrtis based upon such inferential assumptions can flourish only so long as their basis is not cut off by directly perceptible texts to the contrary.
tasya syāttatparicchedātmāvakāśapramāṇatā tadvi dūramapi prāpta me kamapyagataṃ padam / itareṇa gate nādāve kāntenaiva jīyate	And when their basis has been so cut off, they have not a much longer span of existence left to them and die off exactly like the branches of a tree that has been uprooted. A direct selfsufficient authority is not possible for the Smrtis them selves, by which they could be independent of extraneous support and as for this support, we do not find any in the case of such Smrtis as are contary to Vedic Texts.
na hi yena pramāṇatvaṃ labdhapūrvaṃ kadā cana/	by means of the direct text already available, there can be no necessity for an inference of assumed texts.
tena tatsarvadā labhyamityājñāpayatīśvaraḥ yasya tūtpadyamānasya mūnameva nikṛntyate /	If with regard to a certain matter, the Smrti text dealt with a phase of the subject other than that treated of in the Vedic Text contra dicting it, then to a certain extent, its authority could have a chance of being admitted with reference to that particular phase.
mukhaṃ vā rudhyate tasya nātmanābhaḥ kaढ़ā cana	But when the subject mentioned in the Smrti has already been dealt with, either in the same or in a contrary manner, by the Veda, then, with regard to that object, the Smrti cannot be admitted to have any authority.
na cāpi bādhakābhāvāllabdha ātmati sarvadā/	Because in the case of any two means of cognition operating contrary ways, with regard to a common objective, the one that has a quicker action accom plishes its object sooner, and leaves no chance for the accomplishment of the slower.
labdhavyaḥ sa virodhe 'pi pūrvasāmānyadarśanāt	And even if the latter is only one degree slower than the former, it is bound to lose in the long run, because its opponent will have reached the goal long before it.
apavādena vā yasmādutsargo bādhitaḥ kva cit / tasmātsarvatra bādhyo 'sāvityetadapi neṣyate yo hi sāmānyadṛṣṭena vyavahāra ninoṣati /	And even though in certain cases the Smrti has been found to have an authority that can force us to admit its authority even in cases where it is contradicted by the Veda yet it is a general rule that whenever a cer tain thing is going to be brought forth, it comes to be accomplished only if it is not interrupted in its accomplishment by something that is contra dictory to it. Whereas that, which has its very foundation cut off while it is not fully brought forth, or which has its very source cut off, can never attain an accomplished condition.
tṛṣṇācchedo bhavettasya mṛgatṛṣṇājalairapi /	And this is the case with the authority of the Smrtis in question.
vipralambhabhayādeva na snānādi samācaret	But even though it is not accom plished, when interrupted by a stronger opponent, yet it does not follow from this that it would not be accomplished, even in the absence of such opposition.
ataḥ va citpramāṇatvaṃ ka cidapyapramāṇatām /	Hence though the Smrti that is contradictory to the Veda may not have real authority, yet that does not affect the authority of other Smrtis that are quite compatible with the Veda.
vyavasthāpayatāṃ nyāyainna bhavedarddhavaiśasam tasmādevaṃ na vaktavyaṃ sarvāsāṃ vā pramāṇatā /	Hence though the Smrtis compatible with the Veda may be authoritative, yet that does not establish the authoritativeness of those that are contrary to it. Because, in all cases where we have a general rule and an exception, all cases cannot be covered by the general rule itself on the other hand, while the exception sets aside the general rule, in a particular case, it does not follow that the general rule would be thus set aside in all cases.
athavā sā na kasyāścidyadi ka cidanāśritā vikalpaḥ kiṃ punastāsāṃ neṣyate śrutibhiḥ saha	What is proper in such cases is to carefully differentiate the cases where the general rule and the exception may be severally applicable, and then accordingly, ascertain where the one will set aside the other which cannot be ascertained by means of a vague general perception. For one, who would base his actions upon such.
vikalpasyāṣṭadoṣatvānna tāvatkhabhyupeyatā / pāścike cāpramāṇatve smṛtayaḥ sunirākarāḥ	general perceptions, would succeed in allaying his thirst by the waters of the mirage because in this case also he has a general perception of water conversely, having found his idea of water to have been an illusion in the case of the mirage, he would not perform his ablutions, even in a tank, fearing lest he be deceived in this case also.
pramāṇapadavoṃ yāvannārohatyeva hi smṛtiḥ/	As a matter of fact however in the case of the mirage the notion of water is accepted as true, only so long as one has not acquired the knowledge that it is not water, but only a mirage.
bādhyate tāvadatyantaṃ śrutyā 'nyanirapekṣayā parādhīnapramāṇatvānna pramāṇapaḍhe sthitā /	In the same manner, then, Inference is accepted as true, only so long as its objective is not found to be covered by a Senseperception contrary to it. Thus then, the authority of the Smrti can be accepted to be based upon inferred assumed Vedic Texts, only so long as the subject of that Smrti is not found to be covered by a direct Vedic Text contradictory to it.
pramāṇatvaṃ pratītaṃ yadujjvanantadapadbhutam /	Because just as the notion of water is found to be true, in the case of the perception of real water, while untrue in that of the mirage, in the same manner we can, as reasonably, accept the Smrti to be authoritative when it is found to be in keeping with the Veda, while reject it as having no authority, when found to be contradictory to direct Vedic Texts.
ekastāvadayaṃ doṣaḥ syātpratītiviparyyayāt	And it cannot be rightly urged that either all Smrtis should be accepted as authoritative, or, if its authority be denied in one case, the whole of it should be considered unauthoritative.
so 'pi syādaparo doṣaḥ pramāṇārthaviparthyayāt /	Thus then, we conclude that the Smrtis that are contradictory to the Veda, have no authority, because any assumption of Vedic Texts in their support being precluded by direct Vedic Texts, they cannot but have their origin elsewhere in Illusion, Ignorance, &c.
etaeva prasajyerandritīye 'pi prakalpite / evameṣo'ṣṭadoṣo 'pi yadrohiyavavākyayoḥ	Question Why cannot such Smrtis be accepted as laying down optional alternatives to those laid down in the Texts that they are found to contradict? Answer All alternative options are open to eightfold objections ex plained below and as such, it is not very desirable to accept them.
śrotā tatra pravṛtto 'pi brohiśāstreṇa kṛpyate / dābhyāmaśvamukhīvacca śrutibhyāmabhitaḥ samam	And further if by the acceptance of such option a partial unauthoritativeness of the Smrti be accepted, it becomes very easy for us to deny its authority completely on the strength of the wellestablished authority of the Vedic Texts that it is found to contradict.
prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	How then can it be accepted in the present case, where the authority of one alternative is one step fur ther removed from that of the other, and is got at by means of external aids? That is to say, before the particular Smrti would succeed in acquir ing its authority secondhand, from the assumed Vedic Text, it would be set aside by the Direct Vedic Texts, that are selfauthoritative and as such not depending upon any extraneous authority.
ubhayorapramāṇatvaṃ pratighātātprasajyate /	The acceptance of option, even in a case when both the alternatives are equally authoritative, cannot be accepted until we assume the partial unauthoritativeness of both of them.
tatra prāmāṇyayogyasya yadaprāmāṇyakalpanam	Thus then, in the case of a single sen tence, we have shown the acceptance of Option to be open to four objec tions and the same would be found to be the case with regard to any other sentence.
ekasya vā pramāṇatvaṃ paricartuṃ na śakyate / tadaprāmāṇyamātre tu na iyorapramāṇatā	contradictory, both the texts are unauthoritative partially, and in this case the unauthoritativeness of that which being a part of the Veda is fully capable of all authority, is accepted, because there is no help in the matter if there were any way out of it, such an assumption could never be allowed. In the case in question, on the other hand, we can never deny the authority of one alternative the Veda and the unauthoritative character of the other alternative the Smrti alone, cannot establish the unauthori tativeness of both.
sa cāyamubhayornāśa ubhayārthāparigrahāt / miśrarvā yajamānasya miśrāṇāṃ vidhyadarśanāt brohayo nirapekṣā hi jñāyanta yāgasādhanam / yavāścaivatasteṣāṃ miśratvaṃ nāvakalpate /	Even in ordinary worldly affairs, we find that when a man falls in a position where he must lose either one thing or many things, when there is a chance of all being lost, he gladly renounces half the number and keeps the other half so in the case in question, when we are given the option of either denying the authority, at least partially, of both the Veda and the Smrti, or accepting the authority of the Veda and the Smrti in keeping with it, and denying that of the contradictory Smrti, we cannot but gladly choose the latter alternative as decidedly the wiser and the more reasonable of the two. And when both are rejected, then we have a destruction of the autho rity of both which is also the case if the sacrificer offers at his sacrifice, mixed offerings of Yava and Vrihi because no such mixed offering has been laid down anywhere.
naiva vroddibhiriṣṭaṃ syādyavairna ca yathāśrutaiḥ / miśrairijyeta cettatra bhavedubhayabādhanam sayamatyantamanyāyyā iyorapyanavasthitiḥ /	If the Vrihi alone, or the Yava alone, were found unable to ac complish the desired sacrifice, and if, for that reason a mixture of the two were used, these facts would set aside the authority of both the Injunc tions of Yava as well as of Vrihi. Thus then, we find that this idea of employing their mixture is equal in all respects to the suspicion that none of the two is able to accomplish the desired sacrifice and as such this would also lead to the complete denial of the authority of both and it would be far better to attribute unauthoritativeness to each of them by turns.

na hi tatraikarūpatve cihnaṃ kiṃ ciyavasthitam / yenaikatra pramāṇatvaṃ syādanyatrāpramāṇatā /	Specially as in this case there is nothing to justify us in adhering to any one of the two, exclusively, which one we shall accept as authoritative, while denying the authority of the other.
śrutismṛtyoḥ punaḥ spaṣṭaṃ vyavasthākāraṇadvayam /	On the other hand, in the case of the Direct Vedic Text and a contra dictory Smrti Text, we have two means at our command, by which we can definitely decide to accept the Vedic Text as absolutely authoritative and totally reject the Smrti as having no authority at all.
yena śruteḥ pramāṇatvaṃ syātsmṛteścāpramāṇatā yo yasya svadhaḥ prāptaḥ sa bacavatā kāraṇāntareṇa viparyyayaṃ pratipadyate	It might be argued that the Smrti also would in due time come to indicate its own objective, contrary to the Veda, and as such it could be accepted as laying down an optional alternative to the course laid down in the foregoing Vedic Text but this is not possible because both the texts refer to the same object, and it is not possible for the same object to have contradictory properties.
smātasya bādhakaḥ śrauto balavattvātpratīyate / pratyakṣaṃ cānumāne ca prāgetaddhyavadhāritam	And it is always found to be the case that long before the Smrti succeeds in pointing for its authority to an assumed Vedic Text in support of its own assertion with regard to a certain object, a contrary idea of the object has already been arrived at by other means i.e., by means of the directly perceptible Vedic Text, which is much swifter in its operation, not being hampered by the necessity of seeking elsewhere for its authority.
smṛtyā pratīyate yāvacchutyā tāvatpramīyate /	It is only so long as the person has not quite ascertained what is to be done, that the operation of such means of the cognition of Duty can last when this has been duly ascertained, there is no more necessity of any means of cognising it.
viruddhadharmmatāmeko na ca dharmaḥ pratīcchati	If the Vedic and the Smrti texts were to point to their objective simultaneously, at one and the same time, then there would be no ground for difference in them whereby we could accept one to be stronger than the other and in that case both could be accepted to be optional alternatives of equal authority.
smṛtvā cārthaṃ parāmṛśya yāvattadviṣayāṃ śrutim / anumātuṃ pravarteta tāvatmo 'rtho 'nyato gataḥ yugapatpramimīyātāṃ yadi cārthaṃ śrutismṛtī / prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Or the difference between the operations of the two texts may be thus explained We find the Vedic Text pointing out its objective directly and if at this very point of time the Smrti could also succeed in pointing out the assumed Vedic Text that would serve as its authority, then, in that case, somehow or other, we could accept them to be of equal strength, as regards their being the means of cognition because while the former would be acting as the means of cognising its particular objective, the latter would also be operating towards the bringing about of a cognition of the assumed Vedic Text even though this latter would still be further removed from the real objective, yet as it would have been found to give rise to some cognition, it could have been accepted to be a means of right notion and as it would have been found to be functioning simultaneously with the Vedic Text, we could have accepted both to be of equal strength.
tato 'rthaviprakarṣe 'pi pramāṇatvena tulyatā / bhavedeva śrutismṛtyorarthaḥ śrutiparigrahāt	But as a matter of fact, even when we find the Smrti providing an idea of its objective, while it looks about for a corroborative Vedic Text, without which it is not sufficiently established in authority, it becomes set aside by a contrary directly perceptible Vedic Text, which is ever wellestab lished in its selfsufficient authority.
smṛtimūlānapekṣā hi smṛtitvādeva hīyate / tadapekṣā punaḥ śrutyā bādhyate mūnavarjjitā	A Smrti that would not need a corroborative basis in the Veda would fall off from its position of Smrti Remembrance, which is held to be that of a Vedic Text to the same effect and as it stands in need of such basis, while it is without such basis, it is always set aside by a contrary Vedic Text.
dvitīyena prakāreṇa vikalpapaढ़vīṃ gatā /	II. To explain the other method we grant for the sake of argument that both the Veda and the Smrti are of equal strength, and that they are to be accepted as laying down optional alternatives.

tenaivāsyāḥ pramāṇatvamatyantaṃ pratihanyate	And if we for the Smrti, any basis other than the Veda, this very basis entirely destroys its authoritative character.
na tu smṛteḥ pramāṇatvaṃ punarujjīvituṃ kṣamam /	In the case of the Smrti, on the other hand, when its authority having no basis in the Veda has been once lost in the pools of Illusion, Ignorance, &c., there can be no chance of its being picked up again.
vicchinnaśrutimṛlatvādgastaṃ bhrāntyādihetubhiḥ tatastvaduktamārgeṇa pratihanyeta sarvadā /	The following arguments are urged in support of accepting the aforesaid option All that you say would be quite correct, if the person accepting the option always found the Vedic Text before coming across the alternative Smrti text and then if, after having acted in accordance with the former, he sought to follow the course laid down by the latter, then alone could the authority of the Smrti be said to be totally destroyed.
na tvetasya prasaṅgo 'sti smṛtaḥ pūrvaparigrahe na paścācchrayamāṇāpi śrutiḥ syātpratibandhikā /	But this is not possible, in a case where it is the Smrti text that is found and followed first. That is to say, in the case where a man has come across the Smrti text alone, he at once infers that it has a basis in a certain Vedic Text and when he has once got a definite idea of such a Vedic Text in support of the Smrti, even if a certain direct Vedic assertion to the contrary present itself subsequently, this latter cannot set aside the authority of the former inferred Vedic Text.
gaībhenāpanītaṃ hi harennāśvaśvidgataḥ	Because when the ass though slow has once reached its objective, the horse reaching it afterwards, cannot deprive the ass of what it has already got.
śrādye prapāṭhaka yena vrīhiśāstraṃ pratīyate / dvitoye yavaśāstraṃ ca na tattatprati durbalam /	For certainly, when a man is reading the Veda, if he finds the Injunction of Vrihi in the first chapter, and that of the Yava in the second, this does not make the authority of the latter at all less than that of the former as you also hold these two to be possessed of equal authority.
svaśākhāvihitaiścāpi śākhāntaragatānvidhīn / kalpakārā nibadhnanti sarvaeva vikalpitān	CC We also find that the authors of the Kalpasutras, in making a com pilation of the Injunctions contained in their own particular Veda with those contained in other Vedas, always treat the latter Injunctions when any of them is found to be contrary to one of the former as laying down another alternative course of action.
pūrvaprāptau pramāṇatvaṃ paratvenāpramāṇatām / prasajyamānikāmeva ko 'dhyavasthetmacetanaḥ	Otherwise if the mere fact of appearing beforehand were to be taken as a sure mark of superior authority, and that appearing afterwards were taken as a mark of unauthoritativeness, what intelligent man could ever arrive at a decisive conclusion on the point of the authoritativeness or otherwise of different texts? As there is no certainty that that which appears first at one time would do the same at all times.
smṛtirevaṃ nirūpyeta na tu syānmūlasaṃkaraḥ	And again, if the mere fact of its appearing subsequently were made the ground for relegating the Smrti to the realms of illusion, then even in a case where the Smrti is not contradicted by the Vedic Text, it could not be accepted to be authoritative as in this case also the Smrti would be appearing after the Vedic Text.
tataśca pūrvavijñānaṃ mithyaitaditi cintayan /	And thus after we have found the Vedic text to the contrary, we are natur ally led to think that the idea that we have had from the Smrti is false and from this we are forced to admit that this idea must have been false, even at the time that we had met with the Smrti for the first time.
dāvevāpramāṇatvaṃ smṛtarityadhyavasthati samānaviṣayatvādvi pūrveṣāmapi bādhanam / na hi teṣāmamithyātve mithyedānīntanaṃ bhavet	As the idea afforded by the Smrti now when we have founded the Vedic Text to the contrary is just the same as that afforded by it before, this former idea too becomes set aside when we find the contrary Vedic Text for if the former idea were not false, the latter, being identical with it, could never be false. Objection Even when we have found the contrary Vedic Text, we must conclude that it contradicts, not the Smrti, but the Vedic text that had been assumed as the basis for that Smrti and thus the contradiction being between two Vedic texts, these being equally authoritative, you can not but admit of the theory of Option.
naitadevam / pratiprayogaṃ pramāṇaparthyālocanāt /	Reply But this cannot be because at the time of the performance of each individual action, there is an investigation into the character of its authority.

You have argued above that, as there is no such fixed rule as that the Vedic Text must always be cognised, prior to the Smrti, or vice versâ, there could be no fixed idea as to the authoritative character of the one or the other, if their authoritativeness or the contrary were to be ascertained solely by their prior or subsequent cognition.
yaccaitadanavasthānaṃ tvayā māṃ prati codyate / bhavato 'pi tadastyeva tenācodyatvamekataḥ	But this nonficity applies to your theory also and as such, it should not be urged against my theory alone. In a case where we directly find a Vedic Text contradicting the Smrti text, and have no opportunity for assuming a Vedic Text in support of this latter, it is naturally concluded to have its origin elsewhere in Illusion, &c.
kālāntare 'pi yo bādhaḥ sphuṭatvenāvadhāryyate / yattenāpya pramāṇatvaṃ kṛtaṃ tanna nivarttyate	And in a case where the contrary direct Vedic Text is found at some other time, even then, the contradiction and the consequent rejection of the Smrti is duly ascer tained at that distant time and this rejection of authority for ever after wards, attaches to the Smrti, which cannot clear itself of such unauthor itativeness.
nanu yavaśruterapi tarhi pramāṇatvena parigṛhyamāṇāyāḥ puruṣāprathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda / ntarabādhastadānī mastīti mithyātvaprasaṅgaḥ	And even in ordinary experience, we find that the contradiction of the cognition of other people is by no means a very slight means of ascertaining ones own cognition to be false as for instance, when by some disorder of the eye we see the moon as duplicate, or when we are mistaken in our notions as regards the various directions, we conclude our own ideas to be false, only when we find them to be contrary to those of other people. Objection In the case of the Vedic Injunctions of the Yava and the Vrihi also, when one would decide to use the Yava, his conclusion would be contrary to that of another person who has decided to make use of the Vrihi and thereby the former conclusion would have to be accepted as wrong.
smṛtistu yāvatāṃ puṃsāṃ prathamaṃ gocaro bhavet / tāvatāṃ sarvadā 'bhāvānnāprāmāṇyena mucyate	If it were a rule with all people that they always cognised a Smrti text before cognising any Vedic one, then it might have been possible for the former to have led to the inference of a corroborative Vedic Text and base its authority upon it but as a matter of fact, such people, as always cognise a Smrti text beforehand, are not to be found, in any number, the unauthoritativeness pointed out by the contrary Vedic Text cannot leave its hold upon the Smrti.
adhyāropyeta mithyātvamujjvalāyāḥ śruteḥ punaḥ / labdhameva smṛtau taccatkimarthaṃ kalpyate śruteḥ	Further, in the case of Smrtis, there is an inherent ground of unauthor itativeness in that they have never any authority of their own, but only one borrowed from the Veda and the falsity attaching to them upon this ground alone renders them unable to set aside any direct Vedic Text.
nanu śrutya viruddhāyāḥ śrutimūnnatva niścayaḥ /	Even in the case of such Smrti texts as are not contradicted by a direct Vedic Text, the fact of their being based upon the Veda is by no means always quite certain.
anumānādapi prāpsyan kena citpratibadhyate	Though this fact can be got at by means of Inference, yet it can also be negatived by other similar means of cognition.

And thus we have proved that the charge of halfheartedness cannot be laid at our door.

nanu ca pūrvakṛta sarvaveṣṭanottarakāla vihita veṣṭitāyā eva sparśanaṃ sambhavatītyavirodhaḥ /	as In connection with the contradiction that has been pointed out with regard to the covering of the post, it may be argued that even when the post has been covered, it is quite possible for it to be touched and as such there is no contradiction.
kathamavirodho yadā sparśanaṃ nāma tvagindriyadvāraṃ spṛśyasaṃvedanam / na ca vastrāntaritāyā udumbaryāḥ sparśo gṛhyate /	But how can you deny this contradiction ? Because Touching is the feeling of an object by means of the tactile sense and when the post is covered by a piece of cloth, there can be no such feeling of it because if the cloth is touched, that would not be the touching of the post because the touches of these two differ in points of their genus, individual ity, &c.
na ca vastre spṛśyamāne audumbarī spṛṣṭa/	An objection is raised Firstly, we do not think the Earth to be the Post, while we have a distinct notion of the post, even in a post that has been covered by the cloth and as such there is a difference between the case in dispute and the instance you have cited.
bhavati /	We are led to this conclusion by the fact.
vastraudumbarojātivyakti sparśānāmatyantabhedāt nanu bhūmābaudumbarībuddhyabhāvādvakhāntaritāyāṃ ca taddudvyavyatirekādṛṣṭāntavaiṣamyam / tathāhi	As for the cow, horse &c., even when they happen to be touched by the Candala, the Smrti Injunc tions do not make it necessary for them to be washed and as such we do not accept the fact of these animals being defiled by such contact and as such the case of the cloth cannot be taken as identical with that of these animals. For these reasons, in th case in question, the touching of the cloth can not be regarded as identical with the touching of the post covered by it If the Injunction be explained as laying down the necessity of the priest singing the hymn, while touched by the post, then too, it would be necessary for his body to be in direct touch with the skin of the post.
satyaṃ tatreṣyate snānaṃ tadvasparśakāritam / kāraṇaṃ tadvi caṇḍāla sparśavanmatam	For, in that case, the priest would sing while resting upon the cloth and not upon the post because even though the cloth itself, would be resting upon the post, yet it could serve as the rest or support of the priest. For these reasons, we conclude that there is a direct contra diction between the Smrti Injunction of the covering of the whole post, and the Vedic one of touching it and as such it is only right that we should clearly discern which is to be given the preference.
kathaṃ punarayaṃ dharmaśāstreṣvanupanibaddho 'pi caṇḍālaspṛṣṭavalasparśana nimitto doṣo 'dhyavasīyate /	Says the Bhashya in support of the option theory But wherefore are not these two Injunctions not accepted as laying down optional alterna tives? And this must be taken as basing the authority of the Smrti Injunction upon an assumed Vedic Injunction inferred to form part of a different Branch of the Veda because, as it is, the Smrti by itself has no injunctive power, and is not equal in its own authority to the contrary Vedic Injunction.
tatspṛṣṭaspṛśyamāneṣu na kramante 'tra yuktayaḥ	The Bhashya says in reply to the above question This cannot be because we accept two statements as optional alternatives, only when we do not perceive one of them to be a distinctly mistaken one.
yathā kāṣṭhaṇādīnāṃ mārutādeva śuddhatā /	And as we have shown above, one of the two Injunctions must be held to be a mistaken one and in this the mistake cannot but be laid at the door of the Smrti. And this is to be taken as proving the fact that, inasmuch as all chance of the Smrti text being based upon the Veda is cut off, it can not but be held to have its root in Illusion.
smaryate vāsaso naivaṃ toyaprakṣālanādinā amedhyasyaivaṃ yasmātpaṭhanti /	And if such character of the Smrti once admits of the authority of its contradictory Vedic Text, the authority of this latter can never be suspected to be partial because the Veda can never be reasonably open to an imposition of falsity it is with this view that the Bhashya says it can never have a partial application.
caṇḍālaspṛṣṭavāsasañcāstyevāmedhyatā /	And as for the Smrti text laying down the covering up of the whole post, as it is always shrouded in the cloud of unauthoritativeness, and is never Lo capable of being cleared from it, this Smrti is also said in the Bhashya to be never partial in its unauthoritativeness.
tasmādasti salilādiśadviḥ /	and hence it could never clear itself from this taint of falsity, and so it could never be accepted as authoritative.

It is with this in view that the Bhashya says That which serves as the basis of the authority of the Vedic Text, at the time that its injunction is accepted as the desired alternative, &c., &c. It cannot be reasonably urged that the reading of the Vedic Text that is found to contradict a Smrti Text is wrong inasmuch as it appears quite possible for the Smrti itself to have its origin in such faulty sources as a wrong comprehension of the Vedic Text, or illusory dreamlike cogni.
puruṣasya sacailasya snānaṃ yasmādvidhīyate /	tions.
tasmātpuruṣavahastraṃ na gavāśvādivanmatam	The Bhashya says Thus then, it cannot be assumed that the idea has been wrongly transferred to the Veda.
pūrvoktenaiva mārgeṇa vyāmocaikāntakacanām / vikalpe 'vaśyamāpannāṃ smṛtāveva niyacchati	Or, it may mean that the idea brought about by the Smrti having previously at the time when the Vedic alternative is accepted found to be a mistaken one, it can never attain even to partial authoritativeness and thus the passage may also serve to point out the fact of the Smrti text being contradicted by the Vedic one, specially on account of the former having its origin in Illusion &c.
nahi pramādapāṭhatvaṃ śakyaṃ kalpayituṃ śruteḥ /	That is to say, inasmuch as the Smrti has been set aside by very much stronger opponent, in the shape of the Veda, all possibility of the assumption of a corroborative Vedic text is closed for ever and as such the Smrti can never attain to any sort of authoritativeness.
parasparavirudve hi viruvāvyabhicārivat /	Says the Bhashya Api ca itaretaraçraye anyatahparicchedat and in this sentence the expression “itarētarāçraya” means mutual contradiction, as explained below.

The Bhashya here has used the expression pramāṇāyam smṛtau and the Vârtika raises a grammatical difficulty If the word pramāṇa be taken as equivalent to the word jnana neuter,or, even if it be explained. as that which is cognised made up with the nominal affix lyut, we should have had the form pramānē smrtau, exactly as we have Vedah pramāṇam if, however, it be explained as that by which something is cognised made up.
tadantāvadhikātpaścāṣṭa kriyate striyām tadetaditarāśrayaṃ bhavatītyuktam /	with an Instrumental affix, it should have to be used in the same gender and person as the word it qualifies the word Smrti and as such a final i will have to be added to the word, according to Paninis Sūtra IV i and the word having thus been transformed into pramāṇī, the above clause should have been pramāṇyām smrtau.
siddhācca tatpramāṇatvācchratyaprāmāṇya kalpanā tadidaṃ vikalpavādina ubhayacetaretarāśrayatvam ekāntavādinatvanyataratra	C Finding the Bhashya to be grammatically inconsistent in both ways, with a view to defend the expression in the Bhashya, we should have recourse to the following arguments The Smrti can be rightly spoken of as pramana, this latter word meaning that which attains its authority in a corroborative Vedic text, the word being formed by adding the affix Kvip to the root ay to go or to reach the meaning of the expres sion being when the Smrti attains an authority based upon a corrobora tive Vedic text.
tatra sparśanasya lṛptaṃ mūlaṃ kalpyaṃ smṛteriti svataḥ sthitātpramāṇatvācchruteḥ syāt klṛptamūlatā /	The formation of the word Pramāṇa being thus grammatically explained, Pramana + ay + Kvip, the ya of the root being deleted, on account of its being followed by the Ka in Kvip, which is included in the pratyahāra bal, in accordance with Paninis Sūtra VI i and as for the letters of the Krip affix itself, it disappears.
smṛteḥ śrutyanumāpakaprāmāṇyātkalpyamūlatā na cādhyāropyamāṇāpi śruteḥ syādapramāṇatā / na ca tasyāmasiddhāyāṃ smṛtiprāmāṇya sambhavaḥ	Though the affix Kvip will be the first to be deleted, on the ground of its deletion being necessary in all cases, and thereby the ya of the root will not have a following ka, yet we will have the deletion of the ya of the root, through the potency of the letter of the affix which leaves this potency behind, even when the affix is deleted, in accordance with the Sūtra Ii. Nor can it be urged that there could be no such dele tion, based upon the peculiarities of any letter because the Sutra VIi distinctly lays down the deletion of the letters and y when followed by the letters included in the bal pratyahāra this bal being not a letter, but an affix.
evaṃ tāvatsmatiprāmāṇyaṃ kalpayanneva tadādī parājīyate /	itarētarā as soon as the affix is brought in. And thus the y having been de leted, all that remains is Pramāṇa + a and then the feminine sign of a being added, in accordance with the Sutra IVi, we have the form.

The Vārtika next proceeds to explain that the expression graya of the Bhashya, can also be taken in the ordinary sense of mutual interdependence. We find that the authoritativeness of the Smrti text is based upon the unauthoritativeness of the contrary Vedic Text and the unauthoritativeness of the Vedic Text is inferred from the authoritative ness of the Smrti Text. Similarly, on the other hand, the unauthorita tiveness of the Smrti is inferred on the strength of the authoritativeness of the Veda and the authoritativeness of the Vedic Text is ascertained from the unauthoritativeness of the Smrti Text.
kṛtvaikamavadhiṃ tasmātsidvamādye kṣaṇe dṛḍham / ānupūrvyā brajettāvadyāvatmidvo 'paraḥ sphuṭaḥ hetudarśanāca	And as in the case of the mutual contradiction of two means of cogni tion, the matter in question can be ascertained by a third means so it becomes necessary, in the present case, to point out the third means and this means has been pointed out by the Bhashya in the shape of a reason for accepting one text and rejecting the other The authority of the touch ing of the post is a permanent entity in the shape of the Veda, while that of the Smrti Text laying down the covering up of the post has got to be assumed.
itaśca na pramāṇatva mūlahatvantare kṣaṇāt / vyabhicāre hi notpattirarthāpattyanumānayoḥ	And here we find that this third means is not one that is alto gether unconnected with the two objects of discussion i.e., the two texts. And the two texts we had found to be open to the discrepancy of itaretarā çraya consequently, inasmuch as we do not find the discrepancy in the third reason pointed out, we are enabled, by its help, to come to a definite satisfactory conclusion.
pratibhākāraṇatvena nirākarttuṃ na śakyate	Thus we find that the authoritativeness of the Smrti depends upon the rejection of the authority of a direct Vedic Assertion while the authority of this Vedic Text is rejected on the sole ground of the authorita tive character of the Smrti Text which it contradicts and this mutual interdependence cannot by any means be avoided.
yathaiva vedamūnatvamanekāntānna labhyate /	A As a matter of fact, however, no amount of assumed unauthoritative ness can touch the Veda and so long as this unauthoritativeness has not been established, there is no chance for the authoritativeness of the Smrti.
tayānyamūlatāpīti tadāśayedamucyate	And consequently, in the very action of the assumption of the authoritative character of the Smrti, its upholder becomes vanquished by the superior strength of the Veda.

In the cases of an acknowledged optionsuch as those of Vrihi and Yava, and the Brhatsama and the Rathantarasāma,we accept the option, because there is no way out of it specially as the injunctions being found in the Veda, there is no difference in their force, as there is in the case of two men, one standing on a step higher than the other i.e., none of the two stand in need of the intervention of the authority of any assumed texts and as such, both being of equal strength, we can have no reasonable pre ference for either the one or the other and hence in such cases, we must admit of option, as explained before. Thus we conclude that no authority attaches to such Smrti texts, as are contradictory to direct Assertions of the Veda.

evaṃ yūpahastino dānamācarantīti yūpaparivyāṇaśāṭakaṃ yūpaca stiśabdena nirhigyādhvaryuharttavya tayācārānumitayaiva smṛ tyā pratipādayanti	For the following reason too, the Smrtis in question cannot be accepted as authoritative because we find them to be due to other causes. Nor is it possible to assume the existence of corroborative Vedic Texts either by pre ference or by Apparent Inconsistency, on the ground of the authors of the Smrtis being such persons as were the performers of the actions laid down in the Veda. Because this reason is found to be too wide and as such not invariably pointing to an authoritative text.

These sources can belong only to such Smrtis as have been maimed by a contrary Vedic Text, and not to the Vedic Text itself because a contradic tion of the Veda always sets aside the Smrti, and never vice versâ.
etāvattvicādhikaraṇadva yepi vaktavyam	It may be argued thatJust as we are unable to find a basis for the Smrti in any Vedic Text, in the same way, we may be unable to find its basis any where else in Illusion, etc..

It may also be taken as an independent Adhikaraṇa, says the Bhashya.

And in the present case, the unsatisfactory character of the former interpretation consists in the fact that when the unauthoritative character of the contrary Smrti Text has been already established on the excep tionally strong ground of its being contradicted by Vedic Texts, it is not much use bringing forward further arguments in support of the same conclusion. On the other hand, when we take the Sutra as a distinct Adhikarana by itself, we find it affording an argument, which, independ ently of the former arguments detailed in the preceding Adhikaraṇa, is capable of setting aside the authority of the Smrti texts and for this reason we explain it as constituting an Adhikarana by itself.
tatkṛtasmaraṇairvāyaṃ vedo'dhyetṛṣu tiṣṭhati smṛtibhāvaṃ ca yadyekaṃ bhavetkṛtsnamavaidikam /	J In the case of such Smrti texts, as are not directly contradicted by the Vēda, and yet are incapable of any authoritativeness, we find other reasons for asserting this unauthoritativeness and there is no possibility of such texts being set aside by any means other than those pointed out by this Sutra.
tadā tanmadhyapātyekaṃ vākyaṃ kiṃ cidamṛtiḥ / mūlāntarodbhavaṃ vaktaṃ jihā no na pravarttate	the cloth worn at the Vaisarjana Homa and it is in accordance with this that the priest takes away the cloth in which the Soma is brought, and also that worn by the Sacrificer during the performance of the Vaisarjana Homa and though this Injunction is not found in any of the metrical texts of Manu, &c., yet it is inferred on the strength of such being the practice of the priests.
bādhābādhānavasthānaṃ dhruvamevaṃ prasajyate	Similarly we have a Smrti injunction laying down the giving away of the yüpahasti, by which the cloth enclosing the sacrificial post is meant and this acceptance of the cloth by the priest is also based.

tataśca pratimūlatvā hādhyodāharaṇaṃ na tat / vikalpa eva hi nyāyya stulyakaśapramāṇataḥ	In the case of these Smrtis too, though it would seem that, inasmuch as the performers of such deeds are the performers of Vedic sacrifices, these injunctions must have a basis in the Veda, yet no assumption of such Vedic texts is possible because they may be explained as being due to avarice, &c.
pariśabdo 'pi yastatra sarvato veṣṭanaṃ vadet / taharjjitasamantatve so 'rthavāneva jāyate antarīyottarīye hi yoṣitāmiva vāsasī /	And as shown above, it is far more reasonable to conclude them to be due to avarice, &c. and so the suspicion becomes a certainty. And it may be pointed out that this fact has already been hinted by the Bhashya, by the expression Tulyakāraṇaṭvāt i.e., the fact of avarice being the source applies to the case of the Vaisarjana cloth, as also to the covering of the post.

It is a wellknown fact that Vedic texts are scattered over various branches of the Veda, known to different persons and that they do not occur in the Veda in the order in which they are used at the performance of sacrifices and consequently, it is only right that, with a view to protect intact the context of the whole Veda, the authors of Smrtis, when laying down the performance of certain actions, should not quote the Vedic texts themselves but simply point to them, by means of expressing the same sense in their own words, and then collect them as such in one place and in so doing the words used by these authors serve to indicate the words of the Vedic texts which are themselves not available, exactly in the same manner as certain distinctions of tone, accent, &c.
na cāyamapi yajñāṅgavidhiḥ śāntyādiśākhavat / to 'syāpi pramāṇatvaṃ puruṣārthena vāryate vākyāntarai niṣiddhaṃ yahīkṣitānnasya bhojanam /	And as, when a student goes to a teacher with a book in his hand, when the teacher points out a certain text as forming part of the work, even though it be not found in the particular book carried by the student he accepts the text as true in the same man ner, the words of the authors of the Kalpasutras, occupying with us the same position as the words of the teacher, simply point to the existence of Vedic texts in keeping with themselves and as it is only in this pointing out that their function ceases, they cannot be rejected as unauthoritative, on the ground of their proceeding from a human source exactly as though proceeding from them, yet the distinctions of tones, accents, &c., are not rejected as altogether unauthoritative.
tasyaiva śrūyate paścādabhyanujñāvadhidvayam	Then again, that the Vedas are in such and such a form can be point ed out by such men as either read or remember them and no difference is made whether the one or the other means is employed.
nanu cā ataḥ samavikapatvaṃ naiva tasyāpi saṃgatama ekarāce trirātre vā dasya brāhmaṇasya ca /	As at the time that the person is not actually repeating the Veda, even those who have read it all up, retain the Veda either by the impressions left by them, or by his memory and in the case of Remembrance also, the text is retained by memory.
aśuddhiranuvartteta daśarātraṃ kathaṃ punaḥ syādetadyena yaḥ kālaḥ purastātparigṛhyate / tasyāsāveva homasya prāgṛrbodayakānavat	Thus then those Vedic texts, whose sense is remembered and reproduced by the authors of the Kalpasūtras, and as such clearly pointed out as really existing in the Veda, are equal in authority to those texts that are directly found in the Veda as one may have learnt it and as such, on what grounds could they be rejected ? If a single Farm Smrti work could be found to be, through and through, against the Veda, then alone could we reject that work, and employ the others in our prac tice.
na cānuditahomoktāvuditoktiranarthikā / prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda / keśavayavyayādīnāṃ nātireko 'tra kañcana	But no such Smrti work is found. As a matter of fact, all the Smrtis that we know of, such for instance, as those treating of the Upanayana, &c.,are found to be based upon direct Vedic texts, of the several rescensions, the Katha, the Maitrāyāni, and the rest and if by chance any single sentence in such Smrti, be found to be not in keeping with Vedic texts, we dare not conclude, on the strength of that solitary in stance, that that particular Smrti text must have its origin elsewhere in the realms of Illusion, &c.
athavāntaryadāśocanimittaṃ kiṃ cidāyatet / tatra śeṣeṇa yā śuddhistaccheṣo 'yaṃ bhaviṣyati	And when such a Smrti text is rejected by some person, overfond of logical reasoning, if he is soon made acquainted with a Vedic text, of a different Çakhã, corroborating that very Smrti, how sorry would the countenance become, of this clever logician? And as the Smrti text would be found to be contradicted by one Vedic text and corroborated by the other there could be no certainty as to whether its authority is to be rejected or accepted.

And thus being based upon Vedic texts, how can it serve as the instance of a text to be rejected as unauthoritative ? On the other hand, it ce is only proper to accept it as laying down an optional alternative to the Vedic text as both have been found to be equally strong in their authority.
intaivamapramāṇatvamuktamanyaprakārakam /	As a matter of fact, however, there would have been a possibility of its being totally rejected, only if there were a real contradiction but in the present case, there is no contradiction at all for mere covering cannot be contradicted by the text that enjoins its touching.
jagdhavānāpadi hyārtto viśvāmitraḥ śvajāghanīm ekaṃ vināpyanujñānāt kriyate gatyasambhavāt /	Because if the post were covered up, leaving a few inches uncovered, could not the touching be very well done? That the whole of the post should be covered is not laid down in the Kalpasutra and as a matter of fact too, nobody covers it near the root of its ears.
tathā ca manunāpyuktamāpadmagataṃ prati / tatratyapāpaśeṣāṇāmante śaucaṃ bhaviṣyati	Even if the particle pari in the Sutra were taken to imply the covering of the whole post, then too the Sutra would have its purpose fulfilled even if the post were left uncovered in the small place near its ear.
prabhuḥ prathamakalpasya yo 'nukalpena varttate /	It has been said that this covering of the whole of the post can only have originated in the greed of the priest for the cloth but the greed would have been better satisfied by covering the lower and the upper parts.
sanāpnoti phalaṃ tasya paraceti vicāritam	Atharva Veda should be rejected in favour of that of the other three Vedas.
yadi vā kālavaiṣamyāda satmamavikalpayoḥ / arthabheda vyavasthā nādavirodho 'vadhāryyate	B An objection is raised The distinction that is made in the periods of impurity is due to considerations of the impediments to the perform ance of sacrifices and for this reason the various limits of impurity are not equally authoritative and as such they cannot be accepted as alternatives.
yathaivāśrāddhabhojitvaṃ yathā vā māṃsabhakṣaṇam / śreyase vihitaṃ dharmyaṃ na sarvatra niṣidhyate	Purity and Impurity being imperceptible entities are accepted, just as they are declared to be in Vedic texts and as such we cannot always find a reason for the continuance or cessation of the periods of impurity due to various causes. In the case of the eating at the place of the initiated sacrificer, however, we do not find any cause or object for any limit and hence the longer limit would always be rejected in favour of the shorter.
tatrāśrāddhabhojitvaniyamaḥ svargāyeti vijñāyate /	Consequently it is absolutely necessary to find out an object for the laying down of the two limits.

And the first act of righteousness that will have to be performed would be in the shape of an expiatory rite and when the man will have purified himself by its means, then alone will he be entitled to the performance of such other acts, as will bring to him particular desirable results, i.e., the various sacrifices.
nanu ca vākyadvayadarśanāttatra saṃyogapṛthakkaṃ yuktamiha tvekameva dīkṣitānnabhojanapratiṣedhavākyaṃ kathaṃ prākkayātpratiṣedhati taduttarakālaṃ ca prāgagnoṣomīyasamāptaḥ niśreyasena niyacchatīti	And in this connection, it may also be pointed out, that in a case where one is able to abide by the primary injunction, if he has recourse to the se condary alternative, he does not obtain the proper results, as has been explained in the case of sacrifices. Thus then, inasmuch as the accept ance of the simple alternative, without sufficient grounds for the renounc ing of the chief injunction, has been condemned as useless and not permis sible, it must be concluded that when it is possible for the man to obtain food elsewhere, he should not, for mere worldly reasons, partake of food at the place of the sacrificer, if he has only purchased the Soma, and not finished the AgnishomaSansthāk.
syādākyadvayamevaitadavadhidvaya kalpitam /	Or, we may explain the case in the following manner The two courses of action referring to different points of time, and thereby not being cap able of being taken as equally authoritative alternatives, we must explain away their seeming contradiction, by finding different purposes or signi fications for them.
yaḥ pūrvaḥ pratiṣedho 'tra saṃsthitaḥ krītarājake /	Because what is absolutely prohibited is the eating at a place where a Craddha is performed, within the ten days of impurity, as also according to some authors the eating at the Anniversary Craddhas and there is no prohibition of eating at all functions that are performed in honour of the Forefathers and hence we understand that if one desists from eating at all such functions, he is performing a particular penance, which leads him to Heaven.
paro 'vadhiḥ punastasya naikatvādavakarūpate /	such is the general inclination of men but cessa tion from these leads to excellent results.
dvitoyānnādanānujñādarśanāttena gamyate varaṇādabhyanujñāte nirvāpe kimanujñayā	And then from the fact of there being a second permission that one can eat at the place when the Sanstha has been finished, we infer that there must be some other prohibition of the eating referring to the time intervening between the purchasing of the Soma and the finishing of the Sanstha and that the latter injunction sets aside the inferred prohibition.
pratiṣidvābhyanujñā ca vikalpenaiva dṛṣyate paryyudastābhyanujñānaṃ tasmādiṣṭaṃ vyavasthayā	And as the permitting of that which has been prohibited gives rise to the notion of an option, such a process is open to the eightfold discrepancies of an Option, as explained above. For these reasons, we conclude that the permission is only of that which had been set aside as an exception by the inferred intermediate prohibition.
evaṃ viṣayanānātvādavirodhāṭabādhanam	Thus then, the purpose and the object of the two passages laying down the two limits of abstaining from the food of the sacrificer being entirely different, they cannot be said to contradict each other.
vedānadhītya veda vā veḍhaṃ vāpi yathākramam / sāmarthyāśrama yogyatvamaṅgovatyaitaducyate tatraivaṃ śakyate vaktaṃ ye 'ndhapabāḍhayo narāḥ /	Lau As for the Smrti text that enjoins the life of the religious student for fortyeight years, this has been mentioned, in the Smrtis also, only as an alternative course or, it may be explained as referring to conditions of life. other than that of the prospective householder and as such there is no contradiction by this of the said Vedic text. Manu speaks of the person having studied the three, two or even one Veda, in due order and from this it is clear that the three alternatives are laid down, either in consideration of the diverse capabilities of different students, or as referring to different conditions of life.
gṛhasthatvaṃ na śacyanti katai teṣāmayaṃ vidhiḥ	And in connection with these alternatives, we can make the following distinction The longer period has been laid down for those that are either blind, or lame, or otherwise incapable of entering upon the duties of the householder.
upakurvāṇakenaiva yāpyaḥ kālo bahustataḥ / saṃprāpya jñānabhūyamvaṃ pavitraiḥ kṣīṇakalmaṣaḥ	others, in the shape of wife or children, should spend the greater part of his life in longcontinued study as that would endow him with great knowledge and as such having all his sins destroyed by means of pious deeds of worship, Japa and the like, and thereby becoming duly purified by means of pure study, he would reach the desirable goal, even if he succeeds in fulfilling only a few of the ordinary duties of life.
dvaipāyanādayaścājaḥ	Dvaipāyana and others have also declared thus The Brāhmaṇa having all his duties accomplished by means of pure study, may or may not do any other actions and he is called a MaitraBrahmana.

yo vā kaścinmedhāvitayā śīghrameva vedacatuṣṭayamapyadhītya yathopapattikālaṃ tadarthajñānābhiyogamaparityajana grahaṇāntaṃ vetyetatpaśācayaṇena gṛhastho bhavettaṃ prati dvādaśāṣṭācatvāriṃdaśarṣapaścāvanenaiva smaraṇena pūrvapañcīkṛtāviti nātova śrutiviruddhatvenodāirttavyau / tena naiva śrutismṛtyorvirodho 'tīva dṛśyate /	Or, it may be that if a student turns out to be exceptionally clever, and quickly reads up all the four Vedas, not neglecting, within the same time, a full comprehension of the meaning of the Veda, he can certainly take his stand upon the Injunction that the life of the religious student should last only so long as the Vedas have not been studiedand can accordingly enter into the state of the householder directly i.e., even before he has completed the twelve years and in the case of this person, the particular Injunction has set aside both the injunctions that lay down, respectively, twelve and fortyeight years as the extent of studentship. Consequently then, inasmuch as these are only various alternatives laid down in accordance with the exigencies of particular circumstances none of them can be cited as an instance of the contradiction of a Vedic text. Thus then, we do not find any Smrti text contradicting the Veda the contradiction that we do meet with is only between two Vedic texts but this also is capable of being explained in some way or the other. I Conse quently, the Sutra the third must be taken to signify only the advisability of a certain course to be adopted at the time of action where it is always desirable to accept the alternative laid down in the Veda II or, if it be absolutely necessary to take it as laying down the rejection of the Smrti this Smrti must be taken to refer to the Smrtis compiled by people outside the pale of Vedic religion.
śrutyoreva hyasau dṛṣṭaḥ kva cihnā naiva vidyate etadvi jaimininātyantaṃ hitopadeśinā jijñāsubhyaḥ pratipādyate / yāvadekaṃ śrutau karmma smṛtau vānyatpratīyate /	With a view to offer a salutary advice to the people, what Jaimini says in the Sutra is that, in a case where we find the Vedic text laying down one action, and the Smrti laying down another, and thus there be ing an apparent contradiction between the two, on that pointit is desirable that, in practice, we should adopt the course laid down in the Veda. Nor can it be argued that even this would be an indirect rejection of the authority of the particular Smrti text because even in the case of the alternative Injunctions of the Vrihi and the Yava, both of which appear in the Veda, if some person continues to employ only one of the two the Yava alone, f.i.
tāvattayorviruddhatve śrautānuṣṭhāna miṣyate	at his sacrifices, throughout his life, he does not, by that, become open to the charge of having rejected the authority of the alterna tive Injunction of the Vrihi.
tathāpi naiva doṣo 'sti śrutyarthamanutiṣṭhatām	In the same manner, even when the Smrti is found to be possessed of an authority equal to that of the Veda, if one adopts the course laid down in the Veda, there is no harm done to the Smrti.

These Smrtis that are not honoured by those who know the Vedas, are The compila tions of certain texts relating to Dharma and Adharma, by Çakya, and the propounders of the systems of Sankhya, Yoga, Pancaratra, Paçupata and the like, all of which have in them a certain mixture of the Veda, and are hidden under a thin cloak of righteousness, treating of the various means of gaining popularity, wealth, respect and fame, and based upon the strength of certain visible results, quite unconnected with the Veda, and upon arguments seemingly based upon Senseperception, Inference, Analogy and Apparent Inconsistency those that lay down certain in structions, with regard to the gaining of a living, but are slightly mixed with a Vedic touch, through the mention of such Vedic teachings as those of notkilling, truthfulness, selfcontrol, charity, mercy and the like, and as treating of certain Mantras and recipes for the treatment of poisons, sub jugation of the wills of other persons hypnotism, mysteriously sending away of other people, &c., the efficacy whereof are based upon their success in a few solitary instances and the extremely foreign compilations that lay down absolutely repugnant practices fit for Mlecchas, such as the eating together of many persons, and the like.

Because, as has been shown above, they are professedly opposed to the Veda, and hence they have no capacity for leading us to assume Vedic texts in their support.

Nor are the Bauddha Smrtis found to have any other perceptible basis. In the case of the Smrti Manu texts relating to the Upanay &c., we find them in keeping with the texts of other branches of the Veda but no such support is possible for such actions laid down in Bauddha Smrtis as the bowing to the Caitya, giving of gifts to Cudras and the like.

Nor do they, like Gautama and other Vedic Teachers, assert their teachings to be based upon the Veda on the other hand, they put forward many such arguments, as are very far removed from true Dharma.

And under the present Adhikarana, we proceed to consider those Smrti texts that deal with the actions in connection with sacrificessuch for in stance as the Smrti texts laying down the changing of the sacred thread, the rinsing of the mouth, the use of the right hand alone and the like, to be done during the performance of the sacrifices, laid down in the Veda, and with regard to these we shall only consider whether they are contradictory or not to the Veda and when this has been settled, the authoritativeness.

That is to say, if we find that the changing of the sacred thread, as happening in the middle of the sacrificial functions, is either not allowed, or distinctly prohibited, by the Vedic texts laying down the action and its procedure, then we conclude that there is a contradiction if, however, we find that such actions enter into the very constitution of the sacrifice, helping its accomplishment, like any other ordinary actions mentioned in the same context, and are supported by certain Vedic texts, assumed in accordance with the Smrtis, and do not in any way interfere with anything that has been laid down by the Vedic texts in connection with the sacri fice, then we conclude that there is no contradiction.
anyattu darśanaṃ satyapi virodhe pramāṇaprameyabalābala visaṃvādātsaṃdehaḥ /	There is yet another way of putting forward the difficulty or doubt that has given rise to the Adhikarana the question being when there is a contradiction between the Smrti text and the Vedic text, it is doubtful which is to be accepted as the more authoritative, when it is found that the former deals directly with a certain definite entity in the shape of an Action, while the latter at least that part of it which is found to be interfered with by the Smrti is found to treat of secondary qualifications because there is a difference in the acceptance of the comparative strength of one or the other, when both texts are dealt with merely as the means of cogni tions, from that which is accepted when they are compared with reference to what they speak of.
tathā hi /	For instance, in the case in question, the Smrti texts do not in any way tend to set aside or reject any definite action laid down in the Veda as for the order or time in which the actions are to be performed which alone is found to be interfered with by the Smrti texts, these are always acknowledged to be the qualifications of the main substance of the Action.

kiṃ yuktamavirudtvaṃ kratvarthāṅga smṛterapi / na tadarthakriyāyāṃ śrutaṃ kiṃ ca na hīyate	The question being thus stated, the answer that suggests itself is that these Smrti texts, that lay down certain actions in connection with the Vedic sacrifices, are not contradictory to the Veda because the perform ance of the actions laid down by them does not interfere with the perform ance of the Vedic sacrifice.
smṛtyā tathaiva saptamyā śiṣṭācāreṇa cāpitāḥ / gṛhyante bhāvanābhāvyairaṣūrvaiḥ sādhanāṃśavat	of the Action as laid down in certain scattered passages in the same manner, just as in the case of the above six also when the seventh means of knowledge, in the shape of the Smrti, or a longestablished usage, happens to lay down certain actions, these may be accepted, as helping the Final Result, by being taken along with the Procedure of the Primary Vedic Action even as certain actions laid down by the Smrti the Ashtaka for instance are accepted as the direct means to a final Re sult.
“na śākhaparimāṇatvāt”	This cannot be because the limit is fixed by the Scriptures.
padārtho 'bhyadhiko bhavet / śākhitaṃ parimāṇaṃ hi ko 'tikramitumarhati	That is to say, as the limit of all set Vedic Actions is distinctly fixed by the Veda itself, any addition of new Actions will mean an exceeding of its proper bounds and who can transgress with impunity a limit that has The limit of Actions is fixed by the Scriptures in three ways by laying down a definite order in which the various actions are to be performed by distinctly laying down the extreme limits of the Action itself and by laying down the necessity of finishing the Action quickly within a certain limited period of time.

But the potency of the Final Result has been duly pointed out by the Injunction as taken along with the Arthavāda passage and as such it can never bear a single jot of abatement consequently it necessarily rejects the Smrti texts laying down such intrusions.
parimitaśrutyādyapadeśātideśātmakāṅgaśākhaparimāṇatvādvā na tayatiriktāṅgaśākhāvakāśaḥ /	As the limits and number of the subsidiary sciences of the Veda have been defi nitely restricted to the Teachings and Commentaries in connection with it, which are fixed within certain limits, there is no room for any other science as the Smrti being admitted as another subsidiary to it.

Hence, if one were to make an unnecessary delay, even when he were able to avoid it, then such transgression could never be allowed to pass with impunity, direct Vedic assertion of the particular Procedure.

Or, this Sutra may be taken to extend up to teshvadarçanādvirodhasya because we do not perceive any contradiction in them, which the Bhashya has transferred to the next Sutra specially as the next Sutra already con tains the word Vipratipatti, which signifies the. absence of contradiction, it would be useless to add the aforesaid clause to it while, on the other hand, in the present Sutra, it is absolutely necessary to deny the contradiction which has been urged in the Purvapaksha. Even if the clause had some use in the next Sutra, we could take it with botlı Sutras by means of transference, just as the single eye of the crow is transferred from one socket to the other.
api vā kāraṇaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ yasmādeṣu na gṛhyate / tasmānnācamanādīnāṃ kratuśrutiviruddhatā yatra tūtprekṣayā 'pyanyatkāraṇaṃ nāvalambyate / atyantānanyamūlatvācchu titastatpramāṇatā	As for the Limit, that has been definitely laid down with regard to the Vedic Actions, it is never found to be laid down directly by any Vedic text it is only indirectly implied by the necessity of not for getting any the smallest action that forms part of the sacrifice and as this Limit is always perceptible by itself, it is always accepted as subsequently including the Actions that may have been performed during the sacrifice in accordance with the Smrti texts and as such the perform ance of these latter need not necessarily be a contradiction of the order of the Vedic Action. That is to say, the Limit of an Action is not defined by any means of knowledge hence we could accept the unflinching autho rity of the declaration of a certain Limit, only if it was found that, apart from this declaration of the Limit, there were no other means of avoiding the missing of any Actions during the performance of the sacrifice.
nanu pūrvabhāvitvātpramāṇabalābancameva prameyabalābalājjyāyamtvena pratibhāti	But even when such is actually found to be the case, it often happens that at certain sacrifices, even before we have come to the end of the Limit directly laid down by the Vedic Injunction, we admit the more extensive limits of Actions that are pointed out as subsidiaries to the main Action by the various means of Direct Assertion, Implication, Context &c.
padārthatvena yeṣāṃ ca bannīyastvaṃ nirūpitam / na smṛterbalatvena punastadapanīyate	and when we admit the limits laid down by these latter, there is no reason why those pointed out by Smrti texts and wellestablished usage should not be equally accep ted.
na ca prameyada/rbalyabalīyastvanibandhanam/ prāptaṃ smṛtipramāṇatvaṃ pramāṇasthena vādhyate	And the admission of the Actions laid down in the Smrtis being quite in keeping with the character of the Vedic sacrifices, these Smrtis cannot be said to be in any way contradictory to the limits laid down for the Vedic Actions.
kāle yattākramāṇāṃ hi sarvānte prāptiriṣyate / sujaghanyapramāṇo 'pi padārthaḥ pūrvamanute	Time too is only a sceondary element in the performance of sacrifices and as such con to be considered only at the end of all the Actions con sequently, the limitations of Time that are laid down will always include that taken up by the performance of the Actions laid down in the Smrti texts as well.

tamātraparimāṇamasamāpya samākhyāparyyantaprāpitapadārthagataparimāṇāvadhāraṇamāśrīyate/	That which can interfere in the course of one Action must always be an independent Action which is equal in authority to the former Action, and is not in any way subsidiary to it and there can be no interference by an Action that is of a subsidiary character, and always serves to bring about the proper accomplishment of the main Actions.

sarvaṃ hyaṅgapradhānārthaṃ tena na vyavadhāyakam	It is with a view to this that the Bhashya has saidsuch Actions as the rinsing, &c., do not become the interfer ing agents in the performance of the Vedic Action.

nanvica yajñopavītamudāharttavyaṃ darśapūrṇamāsādiṣūpavyayate devalakṣmameva tatkuruta iti kratvaṅgapratyakṣavidhānāt /	It is not quite correct to cite the wearing of the sacred thread as an action contrary to the Vedic Sacrifice. Because it is directly mentioned by the Veda, in connection with the DarçaPurnamāsa Sacrifice, that the wearing of the thread is a mark of godliness, which lays down its wearing as a necessary accompaniment of the sacrifice.
prasṭatena vai yajñena devāḥ svargaṃ lokamāyannaprasṛtenāsurānparābhāvayan / prasṛto ha vai yajñopavītino yakṣo 'prasṭato 'nupavītino yasai kiṃ ca brāhmaṇo yajñopavītyadhīte yajataeva tattasmād yajñopavītyevādhīyīta yājayedyajeta vā yajñasya prasṛtyā iti /	The wearing of the thread has also been laid down as a general rule, in the Katha Rescension of the Yajurveda, where it is laid down, not with reference to any particular sac rifice, but as a necessary accompaniment of all sacrifices, as well as Vedic studies says the text in question It was by means of the Prasrta Sacrifice that the gods subdued the Asuras and it was because the Asuras did not employ the Prasrta Sacrifice that they were subdued by the gods a Prasrta sacrifice is that which is performed by a sacrificer with the sacred thread and an Aprasrta Sacrifice is that which is done without the thread if the Brāhmaṇa reads with the sacred thread on, he is per forming a sacrifice by that act therefore one must always wear the sacred thread when reading, sacrificing, or helping at the sacrifices of others as it is thus that the Prasrta character of the sacrifice is duly accom plished.

And though this passage occurs in connection with the Brahmayajna the daily duties of the Brahmana, yet it distinctly points out the necessity of the rinsing of the mouth whenever the Veda has to be recited and as such it comes to be recognised as a necessary accompaniment of all Vedic utterance and as all sacrifices are accompanied by the recitation of Vedic mantras, we conclude the rinsing to be a necessary accompaniment of the sacrifice itself. Secondly the Vedic text, that the mouth does not become impure by the tasting of the Soma, prohibiting the rinsing of the mouth after one has drunk the Soma, distinctly points out the necessity of the rinsing at all other times whenever any impurity attaches to the mouth.
tathā ca na somenocchiṣṭā bhavantoti prāptācamanapratiṣedhārthamevāvadhārthyate /	And thus we find that none of the three Smrti texts, cited by the text, should have been brought forward as contradicting Vedic Injunctions. For these reasons, we conclude that the present is not to be taken as a distinct Adhikarana, and that the three Sutras may be interpreted as bring ing forward and refuting certain objections against the preceding Adhi karanas.

If this be urged by the opponent, thenwe deny this because of the number of authoritative Scriptures being limited. Sutra . That is to say, the number of authoritative Scriptures has been limited to the fourteen or eighteen sciences, which alone are acknowledged by all good men to have any authority with regard to Dharma and these fourteen sciences include the Vedas with its Angas and Upangas, the eighteen Dharmasamhitãs and Puranas, the Çiksha, and the Dandaniti.

Just as if a Pandit, when presenting the method of performing a certain expiatory rite as laid down by Manu, were to quote corroborative verses either composed by himself or by others, then even though the subject matter would be all right, in keeping with the laws of Manu, yet, no person with any true regard for Dharma, would go to him for the prescription.

tathā ca manorṛcaḥ sāmidhenyo bhavantītyasya vidhervākyaśeṣe śrūyate / manurvai yatkiṃ cidavadattadbheṣajaṃ bheṣajatāyā iti prāyaścittādyapadeśavacanaṃ pāpavyādherbheṣajam	As for instance, we find the passage in the Veda that, the Rk verses of which Manu is the Rshi are the Samidhēni and in continuation of this, it is declared whatever Manu said was the very medicine of medicines, and what is meant by this is that the expiatory rites that Manu laid down are as effective in destroying sin, as medicine is in removing the disease. Nor can the mention of the name of Manu in the Veda be said to be a mere similarity of sound and not as the mention of the name of any person because it is quite pos sible for a name to be mentioned in the Veda, even though it is eternal because just as in each sacrifice there is a priest who is mentioned by name in the Veda, so also in each Manvantara there is a Manu as it is declared by Manu himself that in each Manvantara, there is a different Smrti.
sthitāśca manavo nityaṃ kalpe kalpe caturdaśa	And we know as a matter of fact, that there have been fourteen Manus, in all the cycles, that have gone by. Thus then there is every possibility of there being a compilation by Manu in each cycle.
pratiyajñaṃ bhavantyanye sarvadā ṣoḍaśartvijaḥ /tantravārtika / ādimatvaṃ ca vedasya na taccaritabandhanāt itihāsapurāṇaṃ ca kṛtrimatvena niścite/	And as such the continuous succession of Manus being unbroken and as such as good as eternal, there is nothing incongruous in the person being men tioned by name in the eternal Veda, which, in speaking of his declarations, does not necessarily become noneternal just as in each sacrifice there being sixteen priests and this has always been the case, since time im memorial, the Veda does not become noneternal, by laying down the du ties of these priests.
tathāpyakṛtrime vede tadvidyātvena sammatam tasmādyānyeva śākhāṇi vedamūlānatikramāt /	To this effect, it has been saidjust as in each suc ceeding season, we find the marks of the same season in the past appear ing so in the same manner, the entities that have existed in one cycle, are found to appear in another cycle. Thus it is that though the Itihāsas and the Puranas are known to be composed by human authors, yet we find them mentioned, as sciences, in the Veda, which is itself without begin ning.
avasthitāni taireva jñāto dharmaḥ phalapradaḥ	Te PA From these considerations, we conclude that Dharma brings about its due results, only when it is understood with the help of those scriptures that are recognised to be not incapable of having their basis in the Veda.
tathātikrāntavedokta maryādā vyavahāriṇām /	And we also find it distinctly mentioned in the Puranas that during the Iron Age, Çakya and others would disorganise the whole fabric of Dharma.
saṃvādiṣvapi vākyeṣu neṣyate dharmahetunā	Therefore, we conclude that all that is apart from the Vedic Sciences enumerated above, we do not accept as having any authority in matters relating to Dharma and as such, they are to be totally rejected.
yathā kṛtakakapūrasuvarṇādiṣu dīyate / yaddījaṃ tadapi vyaktamagrāhyatvātpralīyate yadā śākhāntareṇaiva sorthaḥ spaṣṭo 'vadhārthyate / tadā tenaiva siddhatvāditara tyāda narthakam	And this Sutra is to be taken as forming an Adhikarana by itself, treating of the authoritative character of the practice of good men, of which we are going to cite a few instances, which will be shown to be the means of the accomplishment of the three ends of man i.e., all except Final Deliverance. Among good men also, we find some behaving contrary to the Law, just like the Doctors leading unhealthy lives and as such their practice fails to command our full confidence and yet the fact of the act being done by a wise man would point to the fact of its being in accordance with a certain Vedic text and thus, there being a doubt with regard to the authoritativ character of such practice, the Purvapakshi would bring forward, against it, all the arguments urged by him under the first Sutra of this Päda, or, in some cases, those under the third Sutra.
ke śiṣṭā ye sadācārāḥ sadācārā tatkṛtāḥ /	Even in the practice of good men, we often find a transgression of Dharma, and also certain extremely bold excessess as in the cases of Pra jāpati, Indra, Vaçishtha, Viçvamitra, Yudhishthira, Krshna Dvaipaya na, Bhishma, Dhṛtarashtra, Vasudēva, Arjuna and others, as also of many good men of our own days. C.
itītaretarādhīna nirṇayatvāda nirṇayaḥ	and as such not entitled to the performance of any sacrifice, performed many sacrifices, and that too with the wealth amassed by his brother Pandu to which he had no rightful claim Yudhishthira married a wife that had been won by his younger brother Arjuna, and told a base lie with the sole motive of causing the death of his own Brah manaPreceptor Vasudēva and Arjuna are said to have been drunk to excess.
kasya cijjāyate tuṣṭiraśubhe'pi hi karmmaṇi /	And further, you think those people as good whose conduct is good and you hold that conduct to be good which consists in the acts of these people and thus there being an interdependence, none of the two can be definitely ascertained.
śākyasyeva kuhetūktirvedabrāhmaṇadūṣaṇe	As an instance of people feeling sat isfied in the doing of evil, we have Çakya, the Buddha, who was quite pleased with himself at finding faults and arguments against the Veda and the Brahmanas.
paśuhiṃsādisambandhe yajñe tuṣyanti hi dvijāḥ /	And again, we find that the Brāhmaṇas are satisfied by the performance of sacrifices at which animals are slaughtered while the very same actions give pain to the Bauddhas, who have a great aversion to them.
śūdrānnabhojanenāpi tuṣyantyanye dvijātayaḥ / svamātunnasutāṃ prāpya dākṣiṇātyastu tuṣyati	Similarly too, certain Brāhmaṇas are quite satisfied at eating the food given by the Çudra the people of the South are happy when they get a chance of marrying the daughter of their maternal uncle while other people are averse to such acts, considering them to be most sinful.
svayamajñātamūlāśca śiṣṭācārapramāṇatām /	And just as the fact of the agents satisfaction being a highly fickle standard leads us to put a different interpretation to Manus declaration of such satisfaction being an authority for Dharma,so, in the same manner, we regard the declaration of the authoritativeness of the practice of good men as to be interpreted in some such different manner.
vadanto 'pi na śobhante smṛtikārāstato 'dhikāḥ na ca teṣāṃ śrutirmūlaṃ vyavahārasya dṛśyate /	And again, the authors of the Smrtis Manu and others, in laying down the authori tative character of the Practice of good men, without having found a basis for these in the Veda, do not show themselves to a very great advan tage hence the declarations of such authoritative character must be held to have some other meaning.
yadi ca syātparocāpi smaryetaiva hyasau dhruvam	Then again, all good men, to become good, should frame their con duct according to the injunctions of the Smrtis otherwise, by acting by themselves, independently of these, they would become decidedly bad, and not good.
"api vā kāraṇāgrahaṇe prayuktāni pratīyeranniti” dṛṣṭa kāraṇahonāni yāni karmāṇi sādhubhiḥ /tantravārtike /	Because, for the practices of good people we find no basis in the Veda but if there were any such authority in the Veda, such prac tices would have been laid down in the Smrtis and not left to rest upon the sole authority of the conduct of good men. And thus, there being no basis for the practices of good men, these are to be rejected as having no authority in matters relating to Dharma.
prayuktāni pratoyerandharmmatveneha tānyapi	To the above we make the following reply But as we do not find any causes, these, as actually in practice, should be accepted Sutra ..
dharmmatvena prapannāni śiṣṭairyāni tu kāni cit /	Such actions as are performed either for the maintenance of the body, or for ones mere pleasure, or for some material gain,are not considered, by good people, as Dharma.
vaidikaiḥ kartṛsāmānyātteṣāṃ dharmatvamiṣyate	It is only those actions, that are held by the good people to be Dharma, and are performed as such, that are accepted as Dharma because the persons that perform these are the same as those that perform the sacrifices enjoined in the Veda.
kanyakānāṃ ca sarvāsāṃ caturthyādyupavāsakāḥ / pradīpapratipadānamoda kāpūpapāyasāḥ	with various temples, the keeping of the married girls upon certain strict observances during the four days after marriage, Illuminations, the giving away, on the first day of the month, of sweetcakes and other uncooked foods, the various festivities held on the th and the last days of Magha and the first day of Phalguna, as also those held in honour of the advent of springtime and the authority for all this cannot lie any where else except in the Scriptures.
śiṣṭairarācāryamāṇānāṃ satāṃ godohanādivat /	And the Authors of the Smrtisin declaring the authoritative character of the practices of good men and the usages of particular countries and castes, in keeping with Scripural teach ings,admit of the general authoritative character of such of these as are not contrary to the teachings of the Veda.
phalasaṃbandhamaprāptaṃ bodhayacchā samarthavat	It is only the fact of their lead ing to certain definite results that, being not perceptible by the senses, stands in need of such authority.
śāstrārtha kāritvācchiṣṭatvaṃ gamyate yadā / śiṣṭatvena ca śākhoktirityanyonyāśrayaṃ bhavet	The following objection may be brought forward The goodness of a man depending upon the fact of his acting in accordance with the teachings of the scriptures, the mention of his practices, in the scrip tures, as good, would involve a mutual interdependence.
pratyāvedavihitadharmakriyayā hi labdhaśiṣṭatvavyapadeśāḥ yatparamparāprāptamanyadapi dharmabuddhyā kurvanti tadapi svargyatvāddharmarūprameva	But these people are called good, not because of their good con duct, but, simply because they are always found to be acting in accord ance with scriptural injunctions. People come to be recognised as good, by always acting in accordance with the direct teachings of the Veda and when they have thus acquired the title of good, even if they hap pen to do something else, in accordance with a fixed tradition, even though the direct Vedic texts on the point may not be available, such actions are believed to be the means of attaining to Heaven, and to have the character of Dharma.
tenāhorātrapaurvāparyyavadanāditvā hedatadarthānāmitaretarāśrayatvāprasaṅgaḥ/ smṛtirapyācāraṃ vedavacanaṃ vopalabhyābhyanujñānāyaiva pravṛttetyadoṣaḥ	mentioned in the Veda but inasmuch as there is an eternal relationship between the Veda and the words it uses and the subjectmatter it deals with, and as such the precedence of one or the other is as impossible to be ascertained as in the case of the mutual relationship between Day and Night, such mutual interdependence is not held to be faulty. And as for the Smrti texts, laying down the actions already supported by the practice of good men they cannot be said to be useless on the ground of all necessary authority for such actions being found in the said prac tices as supported by direct or assumed Vedic texts because it may be held that having come across the particular practice, or even the Vedic text in support of it, the Smrti may have expressed its own acquiescence in it.
vede'pi hi bahūnyeva dṛṣṭārthagandha spṛṣṭāni vidhīyantaiti na tāvatā vedamūlatvābhāvaḥ	But such perceptible motives being also found in the case of the Actions laid down directly in the Veda,this fact alone cannot justify us in rejecting the fact of the practices having a basis in the Veda. That is to say, we find the injunctions of many actions in which there is always some touch of a perceptible motive and hence the presence of such motives in the practices of good men cannot debar them from having a basis in the Veda.
devabrāhmaṇapūjādi yatteṣāmapi kiṃ cana / tatreṣṭameva dharmatvaṃ śiṣṭācāramataṃ hi tat	Even among people who are similar to the Mlecchas, we find the preva lence of such actions as the worshiping of the gods and Brāhmaṇas and certainly we accept these to be Dharma, because they also appear in the practice of good men.
tatra yaḥ kāryyarūpeṇa śiṣṭānevānuvarttate /	Among ordinary people, certain practices are distinctly specified as good, while there are other actions, which are com mon to all living beings such as those of eating and the like, which help to keep the body, and which, as such, are performed by the good men also.
sa eva kevalo dharmo netaraḥ prāṇimātragaḥ	But among all practices, those alone that are current among the good people Galle that are only are called Dharma, and not all the Actions common to all living beings and as such among the good also.
tathaiva bahukālābhyastavedatadarthajñānāhita saṃskārāṇāṃ vedaniyatamārgānusāripratibhānāṃ nonmārgeṇa pratibhānaṃ sambhavatītyāśrityocyate / yadeva kiṃ canānūcāno 'bhyūhatyārṣaṃ tadbhavatīti / vaidikavāsanājanitatvādveda eva sa bhavati	From this it also follows that in the case of men, whose minds have been fully impressed with the idea that only such Actions as are laid down in the Veda are Dharma, their inner satisfaction is an authority in distinguishing Dharma. And it is not possible for such people, as have their minds purified by a fill of knowledge of the Veda and its meaning, and whose intention always functions in accordance with the path of duty laid down in the Veda,to have any ideas contrary to the Veda and with a view to this, it has been said whatever the man learned in the Veda utters, it becomes Vedic i.e., having its source in the impressions left by the Veda, it becomes as authoritative as the Veda itself.
yathā rumāyāṃ lavaṇākareṣu merau yathā vojcancarukamabhūmau /	Just as in the case of salt mines, and in that of Meru the land of bright gold, whatever is produced in them, becomes salt and gold respectively, so also in the case of the inner satisfaction of one who knows the Veda which imparts Vedic authority to all that it touches.
yajjāyate tanmayameva tatsyāt tathā bhavedvedavidātmatuṣṭiḥ	This idea has also been expressed by many learned people, and has been also poetically put thus Whenever any doubtful point presents itself to good men, they are helped by their own minds, which always help them to come to the correct conclusion.
bahudinābhyastadharmavyāptātmano hi na kathaṃ ciddharmakaraṇarūpātmatuṣṭiranyatra sambhavatīti dharmatvenābhyanujñāyate yathā vā varadānāda/ devatārādhanodbhave / yadvakṣyasi sa mantraste viṣaghna iti mantrite /	And as a matter of fact, for those whose minds are pervaded by the ideas imbibed from a long continued study of the Veda, it is not possible to have an inner satis faction, in anything else save the doing of that which is Dharma and hence that Action, which when performed gives them inward satisfaction, is accepted as Dharma. Or, we may accept the fact of the inner satisfaction of good men being a means of knowing Dharma, on mere verbal testimony of Manu and others and just as, even though many persons may perform any single pious act, yet a contemplation of these persons brings about excel lent results to ordinary people as it is laid down that whenever an evil thought enters ones mind he should think of a pious person, in the same manner, even though many actions may be connected with the inner satisfaction of the good man, yet they are accepted as being conducive to excellent results.
yathā vā sarpasiddhānte nakulo yāṃ kinnauṣadhim	And we may employ the same reasoning to the case of the practices of good men which are laid down as authoritative, in the text the practices of good men also, &c., &c..
yathā vā yāṃ bhuvaṃ kaścidadhyāvasati puṇyakṛt / tatsaṃparkapavitratvātseṣyate puṇyakāraṇam	herb, whatever place a pious man happens to inhabit, that place by his mere contact attains a sanctity that purifies all other people coming to it,exactly in the same manner, the practices and the inner satis faction of such people as have their minds saturated with Dharma, them selves become the means of Dharma and as such they are to be accepted, by people seeking after a knowledge of Dharma, as laid down in the Veda itself.

tatrocyate	E.g.
yathā vā na viruddhatvaṃ tathā tadgamayiṣyati	The word Indraproceeding from the root Idi which signi fies great glorywould signify one possessed of a resplendent glory and as such it is taken as another name of the Sun and he is the jara”des troyer jaratināçayatiof Ahalyāahani līyatē that which disappears during the day, i.e., Night as it is only when the Sun rises that the dark ness of night is destroyed and it is in this sense that we should take the sentence Indro halyāyā jārah,which cannot be taken in its ordinary sense, of an illicit connection with a woman. As for Nahusha, it is true that when he reached the position of Indra, he made advances towards Çaci, Indras wife but through this unlawful act, he fell from his place and was born as a big snake and this clearly shows that it was a sinful act that he had done and as for Çaci, as she proved very constant in her devotion to her own husband, her greatness and effulgence become enhanced to a tremendous extent, which shows that such faithfulness is an act of Dharma.
yo hi sadācāraḥ puṇyabuddhyā kriyate sa dharmādarśatvaṃ pratipadyeta yastu kāmakrodhalobhamohaśokāḍhihetutvenopalabhyate ma yathāvidhipratiṣedhaṃ varttivyate /	In the case of Vaçishtha, it is clear that his action was due to excessive grief, and hence nobody accepts it as Dharma. It is only that Action which the good men know to be Dharma, and perform it as such, hat is to be accepted as Dharma while those Actions that, even when performed by good men, are clearly found to be due to an undue influence of desire, anger, greed, delusion, grief and the like,are to be classified as Dharma or Adharma, according as they happen to be enjoined or prohibited in the scriptures without any consideration for the fact of their being performed by good men.

mandatapamāṃ gajairiva mahāvaṭakāṣṭhādibhakṣaṇamātma vināśāyaiva syāt /	But for people of lesser penances, such transgressions would be as irretrievably harmful, as the eating of the poisonous leaves of the Mahavata for the elephant.

anyo 'pi yastādṛktapobalo nirvahetsa kuryyādeva/	If there be another person with an equal degree of Brahmic glory, he might do such deeds with impunity.

Then again, Rama kept by him, at the sacrifice, a golden image of Sitā, because for the sake of reputation he could not have kept Sita in person, and for the sake of showing that he was not cruel to the memory of Sitä he did not take another wife to him Mam self.

As for Dhrtarashtra, we find it related in the Açcarya Parva that, through Vyasas favour, he got his sight for looking upon his sons and from this we can infer that through the same agency he was able to see when the sacrifice was being performed and hence at that time he was not blind.
yaddā, yajadevapūjāsaṅgatikaraṇaḍhāneṣviti dānārtha evāyaṃ yajirbhaviṣyati / kratuphantasamāni ca dānatapaścaraṇādīnyapi śrūyante tatkārapatkratukriyopacāraḥ /	We are told of the Maharshi being capable of wonderful curses and blessings hence, just as we know of Dhrtarashtra to have been born blind in accordance with a curse pronounced by Vyasa so we can infer, from the apparent inconsistency of a blind person engag ing in sacrifices, that during the performance he got his vision through a blessing of Vyasa. Or, in the passages that describe Dhṛtarashtra as per forming yajnas, the word Yajna may be taken to mean charity, gifts, as the root yaji is equally expressive of sacrifice and giving.
yā coktā paṇḍuputrāṇāmekapatnīviruddhatā / sāpi dvaipāyanenaiva vyutpādya pratipāditā	The unlawful intercourse of the five Pandavas with a common wife has been very well explained by Vyasa himself Draupadi appear ed, in the full bloom of youth, out of the sacrificial altar and as such she is Lakshmi the goddess of wealth herself consequently, she does not be come tainted by her intercouse with many owners.
ata eva coktam / idaṃ ca tatrādbhutarūpamuttamaṃ jagāda viprarṣiratītamānuṣaḥ / mahānubhāvā kinna sā sumadhyamā babhūva kanyaiva gate gate 'hanoti	To the same effect, we have also the following The Brahmarshi pointed out her wonder fully beautiful form to be superhuman inasmuch as the greatsouled beau tiful one Draupadi became younger day by day. All this tends to show that she was not an ordinary human being and hence she has been spoken of as superhuman and as such her actions are not to be judged by the ordinary standard of human proprieties. It is for the very same reason that Krshna himself promised to Karṇa that.
yadvā, nārthyarjunasyaitra kevalasya bhaviṣyati /	If it were not on account of the superhuman character of the woman, how could such an authoritative person as Krshna himself have promised such a transgression.
sādhāraṇa/ prasiddhistu niścchidratvāya darśitā	Another explanation is that there were five distinct Draupadis but as they were all alike, they have been spoken of as one this con clusion being led to by the apparent inconsistency of such a transgression appearing in the conduct of such blameless characters as Yudhishthira and his brothers.
tathā ca droṇatradhāṅgabhṛtānṛtavādaprāyaścittaṃ kāmakṛtepyeka itye vamantepyaśvamedhaḥ prāyaścittatvena kṛta eveti na tasya sadācāratvābhyupagamaḥ / yattu vāsudevārjunayormmadyapānamātuladuhitvapariṇayanaṃ smṛtiviruddhamupanyasya tatrānnavikārasurāmātrasya caivarṇikānāṃ pratiṣedhaḥ	Thus then, when all these apparent transgressions are found to be capable of various rational explanations, and when, as a matter of fact, all good men are actually found to avoid all that has its source in passion and greed, &c., it is not right to question the righteousness of the Practice of Good Men. Thus too, as regards the action of Yudhishthira in telling a lie to compass the death of Drona, some authors have laid down that expiatory. rites can be performed even when the evil is done purposely and as the rites laid down for the particular transgression, are the performance of an Açwamedha sacrifice, Yudhishthira did perform this sacrifice, and thereby distinctly showed that what he had done was sinful and as such it cannot be accepted as the Practice of good men.

Though there is a passage that declaresall the three kinds of wine, the Gaudi that distilled from molasses Paishthi that distilled from grains and Madhvi distilled from fruits, being the same, they should not be drunk by the Brahmavādis, yet here the word Brahmavādi should be taken as denoting the Brahmanas only as the word literally means one who is capable of teaching Brahma, or whose duty it is to teach Brahma, or whose excellence lies in such teaching and as the root Vada is synonymous with Bru such duties are distinctly restricted to the Brahmana alone, by such texts as from among the three higher castes, the Brahmana alone should teach. And it has also been pointed out in connection with the villificatory Arthavāda, that are taken along with the prohibition of wines in general, that the Brahmana, deluded under the influence of wine, might do many such things as should not be done, which shows that wine in general is prohibited for the Brahmana only.
tasmādetaduktaṃ bhavati yathaivai kānnasurā trayāṇāmapyapeyā tathā sarvā brahmavādibhirapeyeti /	Hence we take the passageAll the three kinds of wine, &c., to mean that just as the one, Sura distilled from grains, is not drinkable by the three higher castes, so are all the three undrinkable by the Brahmana.
itarathā yathaivaiketi ca brahmavādibhiriti cobhayamapyanarthakameva syāt /	Other wise, if the simple prohibition of wine in general were meant, then the words Yathaiva, &c., and Brahmavādibhih would be totally redundant.

Though Subhadra is spoken of as Krshnas sister, yet, we know that only three personsBaladēva, Krshna, and Ekanança have been spoken of as uterine brothers and sisters and hence we conclude that Subhadrã must have been a distant cousin of Krshnas, as is clear from the fact of her being married to Arjuna, who could be said to have transgressed the law, only if he had married a child of Vasudevas who was his maternal uncle and certainly he committed no transgres sion in marrying one who was only a distant relation of Vasudeva. And how could such a great Lawgiver as Krshna, who is always cited as an example of righteous conduct, allow of an incestuous marriage, when he was fully alive to his position of a Lawgiver, as is clearly shown by his own declarations viz.
madhusīdhuvivaśyaitat /	O Partha, all men follow my path, Whatever the great one does, the others follow that which he authorises, people act up to it.

As instances of transgressions, in modern times, of the laws laid down in the Smrtis, the Purvapaksha has cited the drinking o of wine among the Brahmana women of the countries of Ahicchatra and Mathurā, and the marriage with maternal cousins, current amongst the people of the South. In explanation of this, some people assert that as the Smrti and the Practice of good men are both independent of each other, being equally based upon the Veda, both of them are of equal authority, and as such whenever we find them contradicting each other, we can accept both as laying down equally authoritative alternatives and as such the trans gressions need not be rejected as transgressions of Smrti laws, and as such sinful.
na tutantravārtika / yena hyanyatraivamuktam yadyadācarati śreṣṭhastattadevetaro janaḥ /	But this explanation cannot be accepted as correct, in view of the statement of the comparative strength of the various authorities of Dharma where it will be distinctly shown that the Smrti has a greater authority than the Practice of good men.
sa yatpramāṇaṃ kurute lokastadanu varttata iti sarveṣāmevamādīnāṃ pratideśaṃ vyavasthayā /	Others again offer the following explanation All Laws are laid down with special reference to certain definite parts of the country as Apas tamba has distinctly pointed out that certain actions are not allowed in one part of the country, and they are quite permissible in another.
tathā manunāpyuktam	alone does he not become attached to sin.
yeṣāṃ tu yaḥ pitrādibhirevārtho nācaritaḥ smṛtyantarapratiṣiddhate taṃ paricarantyeva /	And, as a matter of fact, we find that those people, whose forefathers have not accepted the aforesaid practices which have been prohibited in other Smrtis, still avoid them and if by chance they do become addicted to it, they are cast out by their own people.
nanu gautamenāmnāyavirudvānāmācārāṇāmaprāmāṇyamukam /	But this explanation too will not serve our purpose because Gautama has declared that all practices contrary to the Scriptures are unauthori tative.
na tvesadapi yuktaṃ smṛtigranthe 'pyāmnāyaśabdaprayogāt / smātadharmādhikāre hi /	It may be argued that as a matter of course, when we find the practices to be contrary to the Veda, we do not accept them as authorita tive and the term Scriptures does not apply to the Smrtis. But this is not correct because the term Scripture is applicable to Smrti works also.
granthakāragatāyāḥ smṛtestatkṛta granthāmnāyaḥ smṛ tigranthādhyāyināṃ smṛtidhāraṇārthatvenoktastataśca manvādivākyapratiṣidvācārāṇāṃ prāmāṇyamaśakyamabhyupagantum /	In connection with Smarta Dharma Çankha and Likhita have declared Amnayah smrtidharakah, which clearly shows that the works of Manu and otherscalled Amnaya Scriptureswhich were composed by them on the strength of their own remembrances of Vedic texts have been laid down for the sake of the students of these works, for the purpose of ascertaining a definite basis for the said compila tions in such rememberances. Hence, it is absolutely impossible for us to accept the authoritative character of such practices as are contrary to the laws laid down by Manu and others.
āpastambavacanaṃ tu baudhāyanena smṛtivirudvaduṣṭācārodāharaṇānyeva prayacchatā nirākṛtam /	As for the declaration of Apastamba, quoted above, it has been completely refuted by Baudhayana, who has cited many instances of practices contrary to the Smrtis.
spaṣṭakāmādihetvantaradarśanānna virudvācārāṇāmāpastambavacanasya vā śrutimūlatvopapattiḥ /	And further, as we find all such practices originating from visible causes, such as passion and the like, we can never accept the fact of there being a Vedic basis, either for such unlawful practices, or for the above quoted declarations of Apas tamba.
kena vā brāhmapīnāṃ surāpānaṃ pratiṣidvam	It may be askedWhat is the text that prohibits the drinking of wine for Brāhmana women ? Well, we have the textFor this reason, the Brahmana and the Kshatriya, and also the Kshatriya, should not drink wine.
tasmādbrāhmaṇarājanyau vaibhyaśca na surāṃ pivedisyanena uccate	Against this, it may be urged that the word Brahmana being in the masculine gender, the said text cannot be taken as prohibiting it for women and as such the practice of the women of Mathura cannot be held to be contrary to the Smrti text quoted.
ahatvā kaṃ cidevaikaṃ tataśca syāt kṛtārthatā /	The other party retorts As for the significance of the singular number, as this may be applicable either to each individual Brāhmana, or to the single Brahmanaclass considered as one composite whole, there would be no harm in accepting it.

hananapratiṣedhe karmabhūtasya brāhmaṇasyo higyamātantravārtike /	there is a deal of difference between the two cases as in the prohibition of killing, Brahmano na hantavyah the Brāhmana being the real objective, appears in the form of the subject on account.

tathāhi	and as such, this would lead to the split of the sentence.

But according to those who accept the Injunction to be the only signification of the Veda and explain the Prohibition as only a negative Injunction, the sentence may be amplified thus The killing of the Brāhmana should not be done, or He who is a Brāh mana, him one should not kill,the passage being thus explained, either as the prohibition of the killing as pertaining to the Brāhmana, or as the prohibition of a killing which has its object distinctly pointed out as the Brāhmana.
yeṣāṃ ta vidhipratiṣedhau nāmātyantabhinna vedavākyārthī/	In any case, we cannot escape from accepting the Brahmana as the Subject and as pertaining to the Subject, either the Gender or the Number can have no significance.

This is not so because even in the case of the prohibition of drinking, no significance can be attached to the gender, because the Brahmana is the subject, here also, exactly as in the case of the prohibition of Brāhman killing. As a matter of fact, the mere fact of a certain thing being yet to be known is not the only ground for attaching a significance to the qualifi eations of the gender, &e., because Predicability is the one important ground for such significance as that which is describedi.e., the Subject of a proposition is described just as it is found to exist and in connection with that, nothing more than what is necessarily required by the Predicate can be said to be predicated. Hence, if we had any such injunction as that the Brahmana should drink wine prior to the appearance of the Prohibition, then alone could there be any chance for the subordinate and predicative character belong ing to the Brahmana, which could justify our attaching a significance to everything that is both the masculine gender and the singular number.
eṣā hyatra vacanavyaktiryat krodhādivaśena brāhmaṇaṃ hanyād brāhmaṇo vā hantavyastanneti/	But, as a matter of fact, we know that the only agent that prompts the Brahmana to the drinking of wine is Passion or Delusion, &c.
vidhyekatvapace punarodṛśī vākyayojanā yad brāhmaṇahananaṃ tanna kuryyāditi yo vā brāhmaṇastaṃ na hanyād iti brāhmaṇaviśiṣṭahananapratiṣedhavidhiḥ śudboddiṣṭabrāhmaṇaviṣayavadhapratiṣedhavidhirveti	And as for an Injunction being deduced from the prohibitive text itself as urged above, no such deduction is possible, as all chance for it is barred by the fact of the sentence ending in a direct prohibition. wine, it being taken either as the prohibition of drinking as pertaining to wine, or as the Injunction of a prohibition,in any case, inasmuch as he is the object that is helped by being warned off from the drinking, the Brahmana cannot be held to be predicated either of the drinking or of the prohibition and as such no significance can be attached to the gender, &c. Even in ordinary experience, we find that there is a chance of both the male and the female Brāhmana being addicted to drink and hence in the sentence prohibiting the drinking, the mention of the Brahmana must be taken as pertaining to both sexes because as the Subject of the sentence, it must be taken exactly as it is found in ordinary experience.
naitadevabhicāpyetatpuṃstvaṃ naiva vivacyate / brāhmaṇasyānuvādyatvāttadvadhapratiṣedhavat	And it cannot be construed as The Brahmana that should drink and he be a male because such connection of the gender cannot be established without the operation of Predication which is absent in this case. That is to say, when the Brahmana has once been spoken of as the Subject, it is not possible to make it the Predicate without a Predicative word.
anūdyamānaḥ sarvo hi yathāprāpta manūdyate /	But such Predication is not found in the present case.
tatrānākāṅkṣitaṃ nānya dvidheyebhyo vidhīyate	Hence, we conclude that in both cases .e., in the case of the prohibition, The Brahmana should not be killed, as also in that The Brāhmana should not drink wine we cannot attach any significance to the gender or the number of the word Brāhmana.
yatastu rāgamohādaḥ surāpāṇaṃ prasajyate / brāhmaṇa deratastasminna kaściḍidhisaṃbhavaḥ tenecāpi yatturāṃ brāhmaṇaḥ pibettanneti vā vacanaṃ vyajyate yo brāhmaṇaḥ sa na surāṃ pibediti vā surāviśiṣṭapānapratiṣedhena pratiṣedhavidhinā vā pratyavāyavyāvṛttyā brāhmaṇo'nugṛhyataiti nāsya pānaṃ pratiṣedhaṃ vā pratividheyatvopapattiḥ tantravārtike /	It may be argued that if such be the case, then the killing of the Brahmana woman would be as sinful as that of the male Brahmana and as such, how is it that the full expiatory rite, necessary on the killing of à Brahmana, has been restricted in the case of the female Brahmana to the Atreyi woman only which shows that the killing of other Brāhmana females is not equally sinful ? To this we make the following reply Who is there that denies the equal sinfulness of the killing of the female Brahmana? As for the expiatory rites being different, this is due to the fact of the one being a female and the other a male but this does not show that there is any difference in the sinfulness of the two slaughters and certainly the com parative slightness of the expiatory rite does not remove the character of Brahmanaslaughter from the killing of the female Brahmana because under certain circumstances the expiatory rite that has been laid down as necessary for one who has killed even a male Brahmana, is also compara tively slight and this fact would also come to imply the lesser sinful ness of this killing which is absurd.
na ca yo brāhmaṇaḥ pibedityanūdita sa ca pumāniti vidhivyāpārādinā liṅgavivaśā 'vakarūpate	In the case of the drinking of wine, however, we do not meet with any distinction in the expiatory rites that are laid down and as such all chance of there being any support for such drinking by women having been lost, we conclude that the said practice of the Brahmana women of the two countries, is a direct transgression of the laws laid down in the Smrtis.
nanvevaṃ sati brāhmaṇa bovadhe 'pi puṃbrāhmaṇavadhavadbrahmahatyāstīti yadātreyyāmeva kevalāyāṃ bhrūṇahatyāprāyaścittavidhānaṃ tannopapadyate	It has been argued above that on the strength of a declaration of Apastamba, we can accept the two as optional alternatives but as this drinking of wine by the Brahmana has been prohibited by the Veda itselfTherefore, the Brahmana should not drink winethe mere equality of two contradictory Smrtis cannot justify us in accepting an option in the matter and hence we cannot admit the authoritativeness of such practices.

For instance, the word yava barleycorn Varaha, Boar, and Vētasa Cane, are, in other countries, used in the sense of priyangu Long pepper, Vayasa Crow, and Jamboo Blackberry, respectively.
ato na dṛṣṭamūlatvenādhyavasātuṃ śakyamiti vicāryyate /	Hence there arises a doubt as to the real significations of these words, in the minds of those who have not thought out the difficulty, and who base all their ideas only upon what they actually perceive. There should be no doubt at all on this point because the usages of all men are equally authoritative.
tatra pūrvādhikaraṇadvayabalena prāmāṇyaṃ pratijñāyate karṭasāmānyā ḍidhisṭativirodharahitatvācca smṛtikārābhyanujñānaṃ mahadanyacca kāraṇam /	In the case of every word, in whatever sense it happens to be used in a country, for that country the expressive ness of the word rests in that sense alone and this local denotation of the word is authoritative for all men of all countries specially as the following arguments necessitate such universal authority The word cannot be said to have that sense for a few men only nor can it be said not to have that sense for any men the only difference that is possible is on the point of such sense being known or not known and it is only this difference that can be perceived, in connection with several men of various countries.

Similarly, too, it has been declared that the root çava is used in the sense of moving among the Kambojas while the Aryas use it to signify modification or putrefaction, as when they speak of the dead body as açava and there are many verbs and nouns that are found to be used in different senses in different countries.
natāvaddeśajātikulabheda/	Hence we conclude that the contest between or the authority of all the significations is equal.
ginnānāmaparimita timūlatvam yāvadācāraṃ hi vedavākyāni kalpayatāṃ veda evaikaḥ kalpayitanyaḥ /	So also in a case where a certain fact in connection with the subsidiary sacrifices is mentioned by a word that appears in the same form though perhaps in a different sense in connection with the primary sacrifice, wel accept the Subsidiary to have been performed exactly as the Primary, and thereby quite in keeping with the Injunction that the Subsidiary is to be performed like the Primary.
rāṇatatpūrvaprasaṅgātma viparthyayāt na tvācārasya sā mūlamiti nirmūcatā punaḥ /	It is with special reference to such a case only that the clause because we do not find any contradiction among themcan be admitted as a part of the Sutra because it is only in such cases that the diversity can be said to be noncontradictory in all other cases, there being no possibility of a coexistence of diversity and noncontradiction.

The sense that appears in the scriptures is the more authoritative because the scriptures are the only source of authority as for the sense accepted in ordinary parlance, such signification can be accepted as second ary. Whenever there is a difference of opinion, the ordinary people of the world are not accepted as the decisive authority, but it is always that authoritative because as for acceptance in ordinary parlance, all are equally accepted while the latter has the additional authority of the scriptures, which makes it the most authoritative of all.
yahā sūtratrayeṇāpi etadevādhikaraṇaṃ vyākhyātavyam /	Or, the Sutra may be explained thus the sense in which the word is used by those persons that take their stand upon the scriptures, is to be accepted as the most authoritative because it is more trustworthy than any other sense.
yadi śiṣṭasya kopaḥ syādvirudhyeta pramāṇatā / tadakopāttu nācārapramāṇatvaṃ virudhyate	It is a peculiarity with the people taking their stand upon the scrip tures, that if there is even a slight discrepancy in what they assert, the whole purpose of the scriptures becomes defeated that is to say, in the course of a sacrifice, if there is the slightest mistake in the pronunciation, &c., of mantras, the sacrifice becomes faulty, and fails to bring about the proper results whereas in the case of ordinary usage, even if there be slight discrepancies, there is no such contingency.
ekaśabdamanekārthaṃ śiṣṭairācaryyate yadā / vigānena tadā tatra korthaḥ syātpāramārthikaḥ	The doctors of medi cine, when considering their own science of medicine, ascertain the mean ings of the words Yava and the like as they occur in particular contexts, in accordance with the taste, nutritious properties and digesti bility of the particular article, that may be meant there and the sacri ficial priests proceed to ascertain their meanings, with reference to the proper performance of Dharma.
prayogaṃ prati talyatvātsarvalokaprayogiṇām tasyāva sarvagāmitvaṃ tatryāyatvātpramīyate /	Therefore in the case of a work on medi cine, a word should be accepted to have that sense primarily which has been given to it, from times immemorial, by the doctors of that science and so also in the case of sacrifices, only that sense is to be accepted which has been admitted by people learned in the sacrifices.
naikaṣāmeva sā hyasti keṣāṃ cidvā na vidyate tairapyabhyupagantavyā svaprasiddhisamā hi sā	And when it is thus possible to definitely ascertain the meaning of a word, we cannot accept it to be of an uncertain signification nor can we admit of an option in the matter because all options are open to eight objections as shown above.
bibhītake 'śaśabdo hi yadyapyaspaiḥ prayujyate / tathāpi vācakastasya jñāyate śakaṭākṣavat	As a matter of fact, whenever we find a word invariably used in the Veda, in the same sense, this definite ascertainment of its signification leads us to a similar conclusion, in the case of ordinary parlance also. As for instance, in the case of the word Yava, the Veda has laid down the injunction the post of the Udumbara wood is to be washed with the water mixed with Yava and in connection with this passage, it is declared when all other plants are drooping, these continue to flourish luxuriantly.
laukikatve samāne 'pi śāstreṇābhyadhikā ci sā bhāṣasthāḥ puruṣā ye vā pratipattistadāśrayā	This passage we meet with in various rescensions of the Veda the Bhashya has cited that which occurs in connection with the Varunapraghasa sacrifice but as a discussion, as to which passage is really meant, would serve no purpose, we may accept it as quoted by the Bhashya.
sto kenāpyanyathātvena śākhārthe niṣphalo bhavet / laukikastvanyathātve'pi nārtho'tīva virudhyate	On the other hand, the Priyangu longpepper ripening during the Autumn, dis appears entirely long before Phälguna, and flourishes during the rains, when no other plants are found to be drooping, as all of them are in luxuriant foliage during the rains hence we cannot accept the Long pepper to be that which flourishes luxuriantly when all other plants are drooping.
tasmādye yājikairyeṣāṃ vaidyairvārthā nirūpitāḥ /	Hence we cannot but accept the word Yava to mean barleycorn. In the same manner, the significations of the words Vētasa and Varaha are also ascertained from the sense in which they are used in the scriptures. Here ends the Explanation of the Adhikaraṇa according to the Bhashya.
meṣāṃ taeva śabdānāmarthā mukhyā hi netare aviśrutaśca śabdārtho yo vedeṣūpalabhyate /	In all the three words cited, the significations that have been sought to be supported by scriptural texts, are such as are already accepted to be the most authoritative, even on the authority of ordinary usage and as such they cannot serve as examples of words having their significations defined by the authority of the scriptures.
jambūṃ na vetasaṃ prāivarācaṃ nāpi vāyasam	For in no country is the word Yava used in the sense of longpepper, nor the words Vētasa and Varaha in those of blackberry and crow respectively.

Inasmuch as under the Sutra Iiv, it will be shown that in all doubtful cases, a definite conclusion is arrived at, by the help of subsequent passages and hence, the above instances coming under the same category, there is no need of considering them over again on this occasion. It is true that under the said Sutra, no notice is taken of the denotations of the words, the consideration referring solely to the object to be used .e., the point there to be considered is not what the word akta anointed means, but that what is the material with which the gravels are to be anointed and in the case as treated of there, the conclusion arrived at is only appli cable to the particular time and place, and not everywhere .e., it does not conclude that wherever there is to be an anointing, it is always to be done by butter, but only that in the particular instance, only butter should be used while on the present occasion, what we are considering is the general denotation of the word yava and as such the conclusion that we arrive at is universally binding and from these facts it may be argued that there is no repetition.
tatsidvisūtre ca sārūpyādīnāṃ gauṇavṛtti nimittānāmanukramayādveta sasadṛśajambūpratyayasiddhiraśavdārthatve 'pi vijñāyata eveti nehodāhatena kāryyam	And again, under the Sutra Iiv we shall show that there are various causes of secondary or indirect signification, such as similarity and the like and hence even if the word Vētasa be not admitted to be directly denotative of the blackberry, the similarity of the two would enable it to be used indirectly in that sense and as such, such signification being only indirect, it could not have the preference over the natural significa tion and hence no purpose is served by the citation of such words as the instances to be considered. For these reasons, we should base our consideration of the present Adhikaraṇa upon other examples.
tatra kiṃ tulyatā yaktā kimekaiva balīyasī /	When there happens to be a difference in the usages of the Arya and the Mleccha, there arises a doubt as to whether both are equally authorita tive, or one is more authoritative than the other.
samā vipratipattiḥ syādṛṣṭārthavyavahāriṇām	For all people that have to do only with perceptible things, the contest would be equal as it is only in the case of invisible or superphysi cal things that the Aryas can have any superior authority in the case of visible things, the authority of the Arya and the Mleccha is equally strong.
sarvo hi śabdo 'rthapratyāyanārthaṃ prayujyate, arthaśca saṃvyavahāraprasidhyarthamabhidhīyate yathaiva hyāryagamye 'rthe saṃbandhānāditā matiḥ /	Because all words are used with the sole purpose of expressing certain things and certainly the things that are thus talked of are those that are met with, and are of use, in ordinary experience. Hence, in a case where we find exactly the same word being used in an entirely dif ferent sense, among the Mlecchas, we conclude the expressiveness of the word to be eternal exactly as we have the notion of eternality with regard to the expressiveness of words used by the Aryas as the reasons for accepting the eternality of the relations between the word and its meaning are equally applicable in the two cases of the Arya and the Mleccha.
yathā ca mlecchadeśe 'pi dhūmo 'gneravabodhakaḥ / evaṃ svārthe prayogāttairiṣṭaḥ śabdo 'pi vācakaḥ iti prāpte 'bhidhoyate /	As among the Mlecchas too, we cannot trace the beginnings of the usages of words and hence we can perceive no difference between two equally beginningless expressive potentialities of words. even among the Mlecchas, the perception of smoke leads to the conclusion of the existence of fire and hence as we find their position correct in the case of one means of knowledge we conclude that the sense in which a word is used by them is really one that is expressed by it.
śāstrasthā veti pūrvavadeva sakalasūtravyākhyā yojanīyā /	In reply to the above, we have the Sutra , which can be explained exactly as it has been done above.
kiṃ ca / yathā sādhvanarūpatvātmamādāśaktijeṣvapi / jāyate vācakabhrāntistathaiva mlecchabhāṣite tantravārtike /	And further, the notion of real expressiveness that we have with regard to the words used by the Mlecchas is as erroneous as the notion that we have with regard to those words that, though pronounced wrongly on account of ignorance, inability, &c., are yet perchance found to resemble another correct word. That is to say, exactly as we have corruptions of the verbal forms of words, so also we have those of meanings,these latter being due to such causes as the indirect secondary significations of words, or the inability of the person to discern the right meaning.
ataḥ bhāṣābhiyuktatvādāryyāvarttanivāsinām / yā matiḥ saiva dharmāṅgaṃ śabdārthatvapramā matā	Hence we conclude that, inasmuch as the inhabitants of Āryāvarta take their stand upon the scriptures, their ideas alone can have any author ity in the matter of such significations of words as appertain to Dharma and its accessories. And even among these people themselves we should accept that sense in which the word is used by one who is more learned and more conversant with the scriptures, in preference to those sanctioned by the usage of people less learned in them.
smṝtyācāravirodhe vā sāmyavaiṣamya saṃśaye /	We may take the Adhikarana as dealing with the contradictions be tween Smrtis and Usage.
samā vipratipattiḥ syānmūla sāmyāiyorapi	Inasmuch as both have their origin equally in the Veda, the contest between them would be equal.
yadācārabalīyastvaṃ phalasthatvātpratīyate phalādiyujyamānaṃ hi pramāṇaṃ durbalī bhavet	Or, we may go a step further Usage is stronger in its authority than Smrti because its results in the shape of actions are directly perceptible, as leading to equally visible results and certainly, that authority or means of knowledge which is dissociated from its result, becomes greatly weakened.
ubhayoḥ śrutimūlatvaṃ na smṝtyācārayoḥ samam /	But the Smrti is held to be more authoritative, because of its being based directly upon the scriptures and certainly the support of the Veda is not equal in the two cases.
sapratyayapraṇītā hi smṛtiḥ sopanibandhanā	Because the Smrti has been compiled, in a proper manner, by trustworthy persons and this fact directly leads to an unimpeded inference of its teachings being based upon the Veda.
sena hyantaritaṃ sasya prāmāṇyaṃ viprakṛṣyate /	Whereas in the case of Usage, the Usage leads to the assumption of a cor roborative Smrti, which in its turn leads to that of a Vedic text in support of it thus in this case the support of the Veda being one degree further removed, its authority becomes weakened.
na hyeva śrutiḥ kā cidācārāṇāṃ pravartikā ka citprakaraṇe kaścit kathaṃ cidupalabhyate /	And certainly there is no single Vedic text that sanctions the authority of all Usages at once and at best the Vedic texts, supporting the Usages, are various and scattered all over the Veda and as such they cannot be got hold of without the aid of the Smrtis specially as such Vedic texts are not found grouped together in a single Adhyaya but they are scattered among various chapters, and can be got at only here and there, and that too, with great difficulty.
tadyathā 'gniprakaraṇe yatsaptada bhavatī mupadadhātyannamevobhayato dadhāti tasmādubhābhyāṃ hastābhyāṃ parigṛhya puruṣo 'nnamattīti satyapi hetuvannigadatve prasiddhirahite hetvasaṃbhavāt/	and as such it cannot point to an Injunction, because the method described is not necessarily calculated to fulfil any purpose.
vidhāyiṣyate tu vede vacanenetyanena nyāyena vidhyanumānaṃ na caitanniyogato 'rthataḥ prāptaṃ yena tasmātprajā daśa māsān garbhaṃ dhṛtvā ekādaśamanu prajāyante tasmādaśvataryo prajā iti vat svabhāvaprāptatvenārthaprāptatvena vā tasmāduttare vayasi putrān pitopajīvatītibadanūdyetetyanyārthā tpuruṣadharmma vidhiḥ /	Nor can it be said to be ex planatory of a wellestablished natural factas in the case of the passage hence people in old age are supported by their children because the said method of eating is not generally recognised as a wellestablished natural fact. Hence though the passage has an entirely different meaning, yet the special ratiocinative style adopted serves to indirectly point to an Injunction of the particular method of eating. The same process of reasoning is followed in the case of the passage because the food is kept on the right side, therefore it is only by the rigth hand that one eats, which though referring to a particular action at sacrifices, is made to point to au Injunction of the said method of eating.
evamannameva taddaviṇato dadhāti tasmāikṣiṇena hastena puruṣonnamattīti tathā dīkṣito nayanaṃ daśiṇaṃ prathamamaṅkte savyaṃ hi manuṣyāḥ pūrvamate vidhṛtyāiti, tathā yūpaikādaśinyāṃ dve he raśane yūpamṛtastasmāt striyaḥ puṃso'tiriktāstasmādutaiko bahīrjāyā vindate naikā bahūn patīniti/	Similarly, too, in the passagethe person initiated for the sacrifice should apply the collyrium to the right eye first, because men ordinarily are found to apply it to that eye first, which though referring to the sacrifice, is yet made to point to an Injunction whereby women are enjoined to apply the collyrium to the right eye first. w So also with reference to the passagetwo strings were applied to each post, hence it is that a man takes many wives, though a woman does not take more than one husband which we find in the section Yūpaikādaçinīwhich is made to point to the injunction of one man taking many wives, and the prohibition of one woman taking many husbands.
tathā darśapūrṇamāsaprakaraṇe 'gnoṣomīya vidhisaṃbandhaslaṅghanena tvāṣṭravadhanimittendragatabrahmahatthāturīyavibhāgapratigraha prastāvāgatarajasvalāvatānāṃ bhūmiśayanāsnānāmāṃsabhakṣaṇānabhyaṅgānañjanāvilekhanākarttanādantadhāvanānakhacchedanāra jjusaṃsarjjanādīnāṃ trirātraviṣayāṇāṃ prakaraṇātirikta strīdharmmatvāvadhāraṇam	ou In the same manner, in the chapter on Darçapurnamāsa, passing over the Injunction dealing with the Agnishomiya, we read a passage descriptive of the fact of the third part of Indras sin, consequent upon his having killed a Brahmana in the person of Tvashtrs son Vrtra, having been relegated to women in their courses and this description is made the means of pointing to the injunction of certain observances for the woman in her courses, a fact which has nothing to do with the main subject, the Agnishomiyathese observances being sleeping upon the ground, not bathing, desisting from meateating, unguents, collyrium, spinning, washing of the teeth, pairing of the nails, threadtwining, and so forth, all of which are to be kept up for three days. Thus then, we find that the Vedic texts, that can be chosen out as lending support to Usages, are so scattered and difficult to get at, that any collection of them in any single place is impossible, without the help of the Smrtis and hence between the Usage and the Vedic text, we have to admit of an intervening agency of the Smrti.
tenācāraḥ smṛtiṃ yāvadanumātuṃ pravartate / smṛtivdha śrutistāvaddharma mevāvadhārayet	Consequently, long before the Usage succeeds in pointing to its corroborative Vedic text through the Smrtis,Grande del pae the contrary Smrti gets at its own corroborative Vedic text, and succeeds in pointing out the Dharma long before the contrary Usage has had time to assert its thirdhand authority.
nivṛccarvaśvavālāderloke'nyo 'rthaḥ pratoyate / vede tadabhiyuktaiśca tasmādanyo vilakṣaṇaḥ	Such words as trivrt, caru and açvabala are found, in ordi nary parlance, to express meanings entirely at variance with those ac cepted in the Veda, and by people taking their stand upon the Veda, And the question arises, whether, as all authorities are equally strong in the matter of the significations of words, the contest between the two authorities is equal, or the Vedic use has the greater anthority.
loke tāvatrivṛcchabdastriguṇatvasya vācakaḥ / triṣṭadrajjuslivṛdganthirvede tu navake sthitaḥ	In ordinary parlance, the word trivṛt is found to mean threefold, as in the expressions trivrt rajjuh, trivrt granthih while in the Veda it is used in the sense of ninefold as we find that after having mentioned the trivrt Vahishpavamāna, the Veda speaks of it as consisting of the threefoldness of the triad of Rk verses, thus making the nine Stotriya Rk verses, the word trivrt thus being found to denote nine.
tathāyaṃ caruśabdo'pi loke sthānīnibandhanaḥ /	So, too, in the case of the expression açvabalaprastarah, it would, in ordinary parlance, be explained as the bedding made up of horse hair whereas from the Vedic passages following the expression, it is clear that the word açvabala is used in the sense of reed.
yājñikānāṃ ca vede ca prasiddhasvodanaṃ prati aikṣavyaiau vidhṛto ye ca te ikṣvavayavātmike/	aikshaviyam would ordinarily be taken to mean made of sugarcane, while in the Veda, it means the roots of the reed. In all these cases, inasmuch as the significations are different, and as both are equally well comprehended, the two meanings of the words must be accepted to be optional alternatives.
loke siddhe tathā vede kāśānāmeva mūlake nanu ca lokaprasiddherddharmaṃ pratyanaṅgatvādvedaprasiddhireva jyāyasī	Though it may be urged that in matters relating to Dharma, the comprehension based upon the Veda has always a greater authority than that based upon ordinary parlance, yet no such superior authority is really possible because in the matter of the significations of words, the Veda does not in any way differ from the other sources of verbal knowledge for it is only in matters transcending the senses, that the Veda is held to have a superior authority.
tasmādubhavyapi tveṣā pratipattiḥ samā bhavet /	Consequently we conclude that the comprehension from both sources would be equally authoritative.
yadi vā pūrvabhāvitvā ki kyeva baloyasī / vedanirapekṣā hi lokaprasiddhirātmānaṃ labhate vaidikī panaḥ /	Or, inasmuch as ordinary parlance always precedes a reading of the Veda, it must be held to have an authority superior to that of the Veda. That is to say, we fully comprehend the sense of all ordinary expressions independently of the Veda whereas we can never comprehend any Vedic expression without finding in it words similar to those that we have met with in ordinary parlance.
teṣvadarśanādirodhasyeti ca teṣu laukikeṣu padārtheṣu pradarśa nādvirodhasyārthavādānāṃ cānyaparatvena guṇavādaprāyatvāt /	Hence among Vedic uses of words we can accept only those that are not contrary to ordinary usage because when they transgress the limits of such parlance, they are never properly comprehended.. The clause because we do not perceive any contradiction among themrefers to the absence of contradiction among the words employed in ordinary usage.
ādivyayūpayajamānaprastara svargāhavanīyāḍhivacana vatkathamapi prarocanāśeṣatvāt saṃjñāsaṃjñisambandha karaṇavyutpādanavyāpārarahitatvācca na padārthapratipattyaṅgatvamadhyavasīyate tadāśrayaṇeca vidhivirodhaprasaṅgātteṣveva vādarśanā dvirodhasyetyabhiprāyaḥ / tathā śāsvasthamancāḍhiprasiddhirapyasmatpaścānuguṇaiva /	As for the passage quoted above the sacrifice became the horse, &c.in support of the Vedic sense, it is an Arthavada N hav das such, cannot be admitted as a means of arriving at the real mean yena of words firstly, because all Arthavādas have an entirely different ose and as such they can at best have only an indirect secondary lirect b ng upon the matter in question secondly, because all Arthavādas ha exacti heir sole purpose in the accomplishment of the attractiveness of a course of action as we find in the case of such of them as the er the he sun, postly beca the sacrificer is stone, the Ahavaniya fire is the Hearator sacr and so forth and thirdly, because they have no action in the ter of the creation and explanation of the expressiveness of words and meanings.
yathāha	For, if the meanings of words were to be accepted according to the Arthavada the sacrificer is stone for instance, there would be a direct contradiction of the Injunction as whenever an action will be enjoined as to be performed by the Sacrificer, we would represent the action as done by a piece of stone.
tasmātmamāpi tāvadbhavatviti prāpte 'bhidhīyate / śākhasthā pratipattiyī saivātra jyāyasī bhavet /	Hence the clause because we do not perceive any contradiction, &c.may be taken to mean that, in asmuch as we do not find the aforesaid contradiction of the Injunction, at na d the actual performance of the sacrifice i.e., as we do not find a piece of stone substituted in place of the sacrificer we conclude that Arthavādas cannot be accepted as regulating the significations of words.
dharmasya tannimittatvātmasādhanaphalātmanaḥ tantravārtike /	To all this we make the following reply That signification of the word which is based upon the scriptures is decidedly the more authoritative because the knowledge of Dharma, which consists of certain means and con sequences, is gained by means of the scriptures alone.
sa dharmasādhanatvena padārtho'dhyavasīyate	If a certain signification is once adopted in the Veda, whether it be secondary or primary, it is only that which can be accepted as the means of accomplishing Dharma.
athāpi śabdagauṇatvaṃ tathāpi balavattaram /	thread is actually made up of ninefold threads. The same may also be said in the case of the triert character of the string which may be held to be ninefold.
svatantrasya hi vedasya dṛṣṭaṃ cenna nivāryate na cātra sandigdheṣu bākyaśeṣādityetena tulyārthatvaṃ, pratipattidayasyāpyasandigdhatvāt	Or, we may have recourse to the reasoning that, inasmuch as when the word trivrt has been found to be used in the sense of nine with reference to the Stotriya verses, it can be used only in such cases where there is a possibility of the number nine in cases where the object referred to has a different number, we can admit the Vedic signification to be second ary, and the popular signification to be the primary one and in such cases, inasmuch as the popular signification is the primary one, we should accept this in preference to the Vedic sense, a point that we shall explain in detail in the following Sutra the th.
tasmācchāstrasthitaivaikā pratipattirbalīyasī /	And from this, too, we conclude the signification sanctioned by the Veda to have a greater authority than that of popular signification.
na samā muktakācārairviprakṛṣṭaiḥ sasaṅkarairiti	Nor can the Adhikarana, as thus explained, be said to be a mere repe tition of what is going to be explained under the Sūtra Iiv because in the case treated of here, there is no doubt with regard to any of the two significations considered.
tathā	Sutra .
mlecchaprasiddhivyava irhṛda/rbalye 'pi samudāyarūḍhibalena svarūpagatena jyāyasī pratibhāti	Even though the authority of the supporters of the latter is distinctly weaker, yet it appears to be more authoritative because of the fact of the conventional meaning of the word as a whole being admittedly more authoritative than that which is got at grammatically or etymologically.
evaṃ nānopapattitvāt saṃdehe tāvaducyate / niruktavyākriyādvārā pratipattirbalīyasī	The third point that will have to be considered, in connec tion with this, is whether greater authority attaches to the meaning got at through the etymological and grammatical basis of the word, as being the one sanctioned by the scriptures, or is it the less authoritative, as being due to the breaking up of the component parts of the word.
na siddhamapya sanmūlamāśrayeṇa hi dūṣitam /	For certainly, it is better to accept the authority of that which has a proper basis, even though it be one that has got to be newly assumed, than that of one which, though well established, is faulty in its origin.
kathaṃ vedagataiḥ śabdemlecchasyo 'rthaḥ pratīyate	How could words occurring in the Veda be taken in the sense that is recognised only among the Mlecchas? Specially when the very sight of a Mleccha, makes us stop our recitation of the Veda.
tatra teṣu prasiddho 'rthaḥ kathamāryaiḥ pratīyatām / evaṃ ca sati yasyāpi prasiddhinnopalabhyate anantamlecchadeśāṃśca kaḥ sarvo'nupalapsyate /	And then, too, the countries inhabited by the Mlēcchas being innumerable, how could one succeed in getting at all their usages ? And if any such usage were not found with regard to any particular word, the signification of that word would always remain doubtful and certainly it would scarcely be possible for us to ascertain the endless usages of the innumerable countries of the Mlecchas.
ya eva syādananviṣṭastatra śaṅkā prasajyate dvitreṣvahaḥsu bādhyeta prayogāndalecchacoditāt / mlecchācārāpramāṇatvamatha tvadhyavasīyate tataśca nigamādīnāṃ sujñātaḥ svārthagocaraḥ /	And not finding such usage with regard to any word if we were to deduce a meaning from the roots of the word, by the help of the commen taries and grammars, this would come to be set aside and rejected, if after two or three days, a contrary usage of the Mlecchas happened to be found out. On the other hand, if we totally reject the authority of the usages of the Mlecchas, then it would be quite practicable to hunt up usages with regard to the signification of a word in Aryavarta itself and this being a single country limited within reasonable bounds, the existence or nonexistence of a usage, would be easily found out in a short time and thereby the commentaries, &c., also would come to have their use in the pointing out of meanings with regard to which we could not find any usage.
tasmāttadarthavattvāya mlecchācārāpramāṇatā	Thus then, for the sake of the usefulness of these commentaries, &c., it becomes a necessity to reject the authority of the usages of the Mlēcchas.
saṃskṛtapratirūpā hi tabhāṣārthāntare sthitā / na cāvācakarupāṇāṃ vācakatvaṃ kathaṃ ca na	And again, inasmuch as the Mlecchas are found to have no regard for Dharma, it is just possible that they may have distorted the meanings of words, exactly as they are found to have distorted the forms of words, because we do not find a single sanskrta or correct word in use among k͟hai them. can never be held to have any real denotation.
nyūnākṣaraṃ kadā cicca prakṣipantyadhikākṣaram / tadyathā drāviḍādibhāṣāyāmeva tāvayañjanāntabhāṣāpadeṣu svarāntavibhaktistrīpratyayādikalpanābhiḥ svabhāṣānurūpānarthānpratipadyamānā dṛśyante /	Even when an Arya attempts to find traces of his own sanskrta words among those of the Mlēcchas, he can only find them by grouping together the letters of two different words e.g., in a custom, they find the sanskrta word aka and sometimes he finds therein his own words, either a little too short, or one too long. As for example, in the Dravida language, though all words are used as ending in the consonant, yet the Aryas are found to assume in them the affixes, &c., that can be appended only to words ending in vowels, and thence make the words give a sense, in accordance with their own sanskrta, language.
tadyathodanaṃ corityukte corapaḍhavācyaṃ karūpayanti /	For instance, when the Dravidas call rice, cor, the Arya reads in it his own word cora thief, and comprehends the meaning accordingly.
panthānamatarityukte atara iti kalpayitvājñaḥ/	And when the Dravidas call the road atar, he reads it as atarah, and declares that as the road is difficult to cross, it is really atara uncrossable.
tathā pāpśabdaṃ pakārāntaṃ sarpavacanaṃ akārāntaṃ kalpayitvā satyaṃ pāpa evāsāviti vadanti /	Similarly they call the snake pap, and he takes it as papa evil, and argues that the snake is really a evil animal.
evaṃ mālaśabdaṃ sīvacanaṃ māleti kalpayitvā satyamityāḥ /	So, too, in the case of the word mal which they use in the sense of the woman, the word is taken as mālā.
vairśabdaṃ ca raiphāntaṃ udaravacanavairiśabdena pratyāmnāyaṃ vadanti / satyaṃ sarvasya dhitasyā kārye pravartanādudaraṃ vairikārye pravartata iti /	The word vair, used by them in the sense of the stomach, is taken as vaira enemy and the use is justified on the ground of the hungry man being capable of doing many sinful deeds, which proves that the stomach is an enemy of the man.
tadyadā draviḍādibhāṣāyāmīdṛśī svacchandakalpanā tadāpārasībarbarayavanarauma kādibhāṣāsu kiṃ vikalpya kiṃ pratipatsyantaiti na vidmaḥ	an Thus then, when the Arya stands in need of such groundless assump tions, even in the case of the words current among the Dravidas who inhabit a part of Aryavarta itself, how could we ever reasonably deduce sanskrta words from those current among such distant peoples as the Parsis, the Barbaras Barbarians, the Yavanas Greeks, the Rau makas Romans, and the like. Hence we conclude that those words of the Mlecchas that are accept ed or used by the Aryas can never be fully trusted in the ascertain ment of words or their meanings.
pikanemādiśabdānāṃ sa evārtho bhaviṣyatīti prāptam	in To all this, we make the following reply Even among the Mlecchas, if we find the word used by them to be exactly the one found in the Veda, we cannot but accept the sense that is imparted to it by them cases where the word is entirely foreign to our own vocabulary.
deśabhāṣāpabhraṃśapadāni hi viśutibhūyiṣṭāni na śakyante vivektum	As for the distorted forms of words, however, that are current in various dialects, as there have been many modifications, we cannot easily discern the real from the unreal.
tat tathaiva pratīyeta pramāṇenāvirodhataḥ / pikanemādi taddhyevaṃ nipuṇairavadhāritam	But when we find a certain word, pika for instance, used in the Veda and its subsidiary sciences, and then subsequently we find exactly the same word current among the Mlecchas used by them as having a certain definite signification, we can accept the word to have the same meaning in the Veda also specially as such signification is not contrary to any other authority.
tādṛśaṃ tu pratīyeta prāmāṇyeneti niścitam /	That is to say, in the case of such words as “pika,” “nēma,” and the like, when met with in the Veda, in connection with certain sacri fices, when the matter is duly pondered over, if a person happens to be conversant with the two languages, he finds that the words are used.
na tadurmapramāṇena vedākhyena virudhyate	in a certain sense among the Mlecchas and from this he can reasonably take them in the same sense in the Veda also specially when such inter pretation is not against the authority of the Veda with regard to Dharma.
padārthapada saṃbandha jñānāpekṣapravartanāt / prasiddhiryatra tatrasthā vākyārthā yānugamyate	And again, the action of man being dependent upon his comprehension of the relation between the meanings and the words used in the Injunction addressed to him, it is quite reasonable for him, with a view to the correct comprehension of the sentence, to have recourse to any usage that he may come across. Hence in the case of the words pika, &c., the sense, in which we find them used by the Mlecchas, not being against any authorities, must be admitted to be pointed out by the Veda itself.
coditaṃ vā pramāṇena vedanetyasya saṅgatiḥ / āryaiḥ sahāviruddhatvāt tasya tairapyapekṣaṇāt prasiddha vidyamānāyāṃ tadvatīyastvamiṣyate / asatyāṃ tu balīyastvaṃ vandhyā sutavalopamam	The word coditam laid down, pointed out may be taken with pramānēna, i.e., ‘vēdēna, by the authority of the Veda and the meaning then would be that, inasmuch as such usage of the Mlēccha is pointed out by the Veda, it can very well be accepted, specially as it is not against the Aryas, who actually stand in need of some such usage for the proper understanding of certain Vedic texts. Just as when such words as loma hair are used in the Veda, the priests themselves do not quite understand what the word exactly denotes and they ascertain its exact meaning only by referring to such people always of the lowest classes as are always engaged in kill ing animals whose authority is accepted on the point as unimpeach able.
kālpanikyāḥ prasiddheśca yā klṛptā sā balīyasī /	In the same manner, it is laid down in the Veda, that at the Nishadështi, it is only a false coin that can be given as the final gift and the point, as to whether or not any particular coin is false, is decided on the sole authority of persons always of very low character who carry on a business in such coins. imparted to them by the Mlecchas.
tasyāṃ satyaṃ hi nātmānamitarā labdhumarhati tasmādyathaiva sevāda/	Specially as such acceptance would be quite in keeping with our own authority as it would not be contrary to our theory that the eternal significations of eternal words can be ascertained by means of the usages of men and certainly the Mlecchas are also men.
gṛhādiṣu ca kauśalam /tantravārtika /	It has been argued above that the scripture being stronger in its authority the usage of the Mleccha cannot be accepted.
mlecchānāmadhikaṃ tadvadabhidheyārthanirṇaye patravāravāda yacca taddeśasambhavam /	And that Usage of the Mleccha, which is rejected as unauthoritative on the sole ground of its being contrary to the stronger authority of the Veda or of Arya usage, cannot but be accepted as authoritative, when there is no such contradiction.
tairevākathitaṃ nāma tacca ko vedituṃ namaḥ	And certainly we can find no contradiction in the case of the words pika, &c., with regard to which we know of no other usage among the Aryas that could be contradicted.
nirukte na tāvalokavyavahāraprasiddhānyeva paḍhāni tadgata kriyānimitta śabdaprayogabhākkana nirucyate / vyākaraṇanāpi pramiddhārthānāmevāvinaṣṭa svarūpānvākhyānamācaṃ kriyate tatra prāsaṅgigikameva kiyaḍhapyarthanirūpaṇam tāni svaviṣayādanyatra durbalānāmapina bādhakāni	For instance, in the case of the Smrti passages dealing with the Ashtakā, &c., which relate to things transcenden tal, and have their origin in the Veda,as also in the case of the words cow, &c., and their meanings, it is true that the Aryas are more trust worthy and more competent. But in the case of the words pika and the like, all that the Arya usage does, is to point out that they are words expressive of certain meanings, without hinting anything as to what these meanings are and it is here that the operation of the Arya usage ceases consequently, then, we ascertain these meanings from the usages of the Mlēcchas, these usages too, like the words, being such as pertain to the relations of words and meanings, based upon a beginningless use of the words for the purpose of the accomplishment of the comprehension of visible objects. And in this there is no contradiction of any higher authority on the other hand, a distinctly useful purpose in the shape of the under standing of the Vedic text is served. As for the commentaries, &c., we do not find them pointing out any other meanings of the words in question, which would serve our purpose of understanding the Veda, and thereby enable us to reject the usages of others viz., the Mlēcchas.
ananyopāyatāmātre va cideva grahīṣyate	And there can be no doubt that a usage that is already wellestablished is more authoritative than that which is newly assumed and hence, so long as we have the former, there can be no room for the latter.
'yathā mahābhārata nirvavacanānyākhyāne dvaipāyanenoktama/	And as such, these two the Nirukta and Grammar cannot serve to set aside an usage, even though weaker, when dealing with subjects other than their own specified ones explained above.
mahatvābhāratatvācca mahābhāratamucyate /	Nor can it be urged that, inasmuch as the Nirukta, &c., would not help in pointing out the meanings of words, they would be useless.
niruktamasya yo veda sarvapāpaiḥ pramucyate	Because they have their use in helping in the proper accomplishment of sacrifices, which is possible only by means of a knowledge of the Veda with all its subsidiary sciences.
prayogaśāstramiti cet	Sutra . If it be urged that they constitute the science of rituals.
kalpasūtrāṇyudāhṛtya saṃpratyetadvicāryate / kimeteṣāṃ svatantrāṇāṃ prāmāṇyaṃ vedavadbhavet	With reference to the Kalpasutras, we proceed to consider the following points A Whether, like the Veda, the Kalpasutras are selfsufficient in their authority, or are they, like the Mantras and the Brahmanas, a part of the Veda itself? This inquiry is necessary, because the case of these Sūtras is not identical with the Smrti, inasmuch as they are mere compilations of what is directly laid down in the Veda.
ke punaḥ kalpāḥ kāni sūtrāṇoti ucyate / siddharūpaḥ prayogo yaiḥ karmaṇāmanugamyate	Question What are Kalpas? And what are the Sutras? The answer is that the Kalpas are those treatises that point out the methods of sacrifices, in the form of wellestablished regulations and the Kalpasutras are those that serve to point them out.
sūtraṃ tu sūcanātteṣāṃ svayaṃ kalpyaprayogakam / kalpāḥ paṭhitasiddhā hi prayogāṇāṃ pratikratu	They are called Kalpas because of their laying down kalpanat of the sacrificial proce dure, and thereby helping in the accomplishment of sacrifices and the Sutras are so called, because of their pointing out sūcanat the said proce dure.
hetu dṛṣṭāntavatsūtraṃ tantrakṣyavyāpi lakṣaṇam / āśvalāyanaka sūtraṃ baijavāpikṛtaṃ tathā	While the Sutras serve to explain the technical uses of words, and thereby to differentiate between general rules and excep tions and they contain arguments and instances in support of what they lay down hence it is only that which fulfils these conditions that can be called a Sutra such are the works compiled by Açvalayana, Vaijavāpi, Drähyayani, Lätiya, and Katyāyana.
aprāmāṇyaṃ smṛtīnāṃ ca yadaśavdatayoditam / pūrvapace na tadaktuṃ kalpasūtreṣu śakyate yaddā bhavatu nāmaiṣāṃ tasminnapi vicāraṇā /	ably upon such Vedic texts as have become lost, and whose existence can at best be only inferred and for this reason the authority of the Kalpa sutras could not be made dependent entirely upon the arguments that have been brought forward in a previous Adhikarana in support of the authority of the Smrtis. Firstly, because in that Adhikarana, the Purvapaksha, as contained in the first Sutra of this Pāda, bases its arguments upon the fact of the Smrtis not being based upon the Veda and this could not be urged against the Kalpa sutras because texts in support of these are directly available in the Veda and for this reason they cannot be said to be devoid of Vedic authority.
śākyādayo'pi hyevaṃ vadantyeva /	And secondly, because the Purvapaksha cannot declare these Sutras to be absolutely false, as it does in the case of the Smrtis.
yathotpādādā tathāgatānāmanutpādādā sthitaiveyaṃ dharmmanityateti	In the Adhikarana on Smriti, the Purvapaksha having urged the unauthoritative character of the Smrtis on the ground of their having no basis in the Veda, the Siddhanta has established their authority as being based upon assumed Vedic texts see above.
kāmaṃ na praviśedgāmaṃ vārito daṇḍapāṇibhiḥ /	And the Kalpasūtras have not been included there advisedly because the arguments of that Purvapaksha are not applicable to them as they cannot be said to be açabda, nonVedic.
kā gatiḥ kalpasūtrāṇāmityasmin saṃśaye sati /	Or, we may admit that the former Adhikarana also refers to the Kalpasūtras and the present one applies to the Smrtis also because these latter too have no independent authority of their own.
vedenaivābhyanujñātā dharme teṣāṃ pramāṇatā / vedatvameva vā siddhaṃ saṃvādādipramāṇakam	Now then, if the Smrtis be admitted to have any authority in matters relating to Dharma, then they would either become the Veda itself, or be equal to the Veda in authority and as such they could be said to have an authority of their own, independently of inferred corroborative Vedic texts, The .
yathaiva kaṭhāṃdiproktāḥ śākhāḥ kāṭhakādisamākhyayābhidhīyanta itya kṛtrimā sthāpitāstathaiva vedasamāmnātamaśakādisamākhyātagranthaniyatāpi pratyetavyā /	Or, by the word prayogaçãstra we can take the subsidiary sciences of Çiksha, &c. And these may be considered equal to the Veda specially as the Smrtis have spoken of them as being the Veda name Veda is applied to the Mantra and the Brahmana, and some people apply it to all the six subsidiary sciences, where it is clearly stated that the subsidiary sciences are also called the Veda. And hence, the convic tion might very well arise, that these also are the Veda, having an independent authority of their own. And for these reasons, it becomes absolutely necessary to consider the matter from a different standpoint.
yathā sāmavatānāmidamasyārṣamidamasyeti satyāmapi tannimittāyāṃ samākhyayāṃ na nityatvapratīghātaḥ evaṃ prakhyātarṣi prakalpa sūtragranthānāmapi /	The character of the Smrti having been denied to them in a previous Adhikarana, they may be taken as similar to the various recensions of the Veda and this notion has got to be set aside. The Bauddhas are found to declare thus The scriptures of the Bauddha being taken either as composed in accordance with facts, or as not being a product of human agency at all, there can be no doubt as to the eternal character of the Dharma as delineated in them. Thus, then, if these Bauddha scriptures come to be as eternal as the Veda, then even those Dharmas Duties that are laid down in them would be such as have the Veda for their sole authority which has been laid down as the sole characteristic of our idea of Dharma, which is quite contrary to that of the Bauddhas.
tathāhi	. Kalpasutras.
yathā śaiśavaṃ bhavati śiśurvā aṅgiraso mantrakṛtāṃ mantradāmodityatra mantrakṛcchabdaḥ prayoktari prayukta evaṃ tasya tasya ka rūpasya sūtrasya vā prayoktārastatkāritvena vyapadecyante /	Or, just as in the case of the different Sāmas, even though each of them is called after a distinct Rshi, that does not serve to deprive them of their eternality so, in the same manner, the fact of the Kalpasūtras being called after certain persons cannot deprive them of theirs. Because, even in the case of the Kalpasutras, we do not find any men tion of authors that are not Rshis and as for the authorship of Rshis, it is a fact common to these Sutras and the Veda. For instance, we read with regard to the mantra called Caiçava It is called Caiçava, because Angiras was a child, and yet an author among the composers of the mantra where it is clear that the word composer or author means one who used Angiras having brought the particular mantra into use. In the same manner, the word author as applied to the compilers of the Kalpasutras may be taken as signifying one who uses.

Katyāyana also, in the section dealing with the Lakshaṇasutra, has declared, in the closing sentences of the section on the hymns laid down in the Brāhmaṇas as to be sung at the sacrifices, we will not act according to the injunctions of the Brāhmaṇas as apart from the Kalpas, as we will, in accordance with those contained in the Maçaka Kalpa.

In connec tion with the Arbhava Hymn, the Sama that appears next after the Gayatra, has been named by him Sam and next after this he men tions the Jarabodhiya referred to by him by quoting a part of the first word of this Sama while by means of the word dhe, which is the name of the Agnishtoma Sama in connection with the Jyotishtoma, it has been shown that it is the Yajnayajniya alone that is held to be the Sama belonging to the Agnishtoma.
yadi ca kalādbrāhmaṇa matiriktaṃ kātyāyano 'maṃsyata tataḥ pratyakṣabrāhmaṇadṛṣṭaṃ vikalpamevāvacyat	And certainly, if Kāṭyāyana would have considered the Brāhmaṇa to be superior to the Kalpa, he should unhesitatingly have accepted the option that is distinctly laid down in the Brāhmaṇa.
ācāryyavacanānāṃ ca prāmāṇyaṃ yateśrutau /	Even the Veda itself has declared the unimpeachable authority of the declarations of great teachers and certainly.
yānya pya pratyayitapuruṣavacanāni pramāṇāntarasaṃgatārthāni bhavanti tānyapi satyatvenāvadhārthyante kimaṅga punaḥ satyavācā va canāni	Even the assertions of untrustworthy persons are accepted as true, when found to be corroborated by other means of knowledge how, then, can it be denied in the case of the assertions of persons universally held to be truthful? specially when the assertions of such persons, are found to be in keeping with those in the Veda, and thereby ascertained to be true, who can reasonably declare otherwise? And again, as a matter of fact, we find the persons learned in sacrifices to be performing sacrifices by the help of the Kalpas, even without any knowledge of the Veda while with the help of the Mantra and Brāhmaṇa portions of the Veda, without that of the Kalpas, they are never able to perform any.
tu tunnyaṃ ca sāṃpradāyikaṃ svādhyāyādhyayanavidhivacanaṃ māgdarśitaṃ kalpagrahaṇāt tantravārtike /	The authority of longestablished tradition, too, is equal in the two cases of the Mantra and the Kalpa, as is shown by the details laid down in connection with the injunction of Vedic study, the sentence above quoted containing the name of the Kalpas, together with those of the Mantra, the Brāhmaṇa and the rest.
anuyogeṣu vedānāṃ ghaṭikā mārgavṛttiṣu / na kalpasūtrahonānāṃ labhyate kṛtsvavedatā /	And the agents of tradition i.e., the genteel people of our own day, as also the students of the Veda, are found to be making as great efforts to learn the Kalpasūtras, as they do in that of the Mantra and the Brāhmaṇa. As the uses of the different portions of the Veda keep on continu ously revolving, like the moving of a pulley, no Veda is held to be complete in all its parts, without the Kalpasutras.
tasmātkarmaprayogāṇāṃ śāstrametadatisphuṭam /	Hence, we conclude that this science of Rituals, the Kalpasutras, &c., must be either the Veda itself, or equal to the Veda in authority. .
vedo vā vedatunnyaṃ vā kalpasūtrādyasaṃśayam	Kalpasutras and Smrtis. The above arguments would also prove that the character of the Veda belongs to the ordinary Smrtis, as also to the six Subsidiary Sciences or these too, like the Kalpasūtras, may be held to be equal to it in authority.
dharmaśāstrapadaṃ yeṣu sarvakālaṃ prayujyate / prayogaśāstratāṃ teṣāṃ vedajñaḥ ko hariṣyati kiṃ ca	How can any person knowing the Veda deny the character of the science or Scripture Method to such Smrtis as have al ways been known as Dharmaçãstra scripture of Dharma? Specially as the Vedas, its six Subsidiary Sciences, and the Dharmaçãstras, are all counted together, by persons knowing the Veda, as constituting the Fourteen Sciences. And further, just as we find Mantras pointing to the actions laid down in the Brāhmaṇas, so also we find Mantras pointing to those laid down in the Dharmaçãstrassuch as the Ashtaka and the like.
tathāvakorṇiyāgādi kucchracāndrāyaṇādi vā / vedamantraprakābhyaṃ satvayaṃ kathamavaidikam evaṃ ca vedamūnatvaṃ kimeṣāmanumīyate /	In the same manner, such penances, as the performance of the Avakirinī sacrifice, the Krcchra, the Candrayana and the like,being distinctly pointed out by Vedic Mantras, how can they be said to be contrary F Brāhmaṇa boy as being without his Çikha, which speaks of the absence of his Çikha as a wellestablished fact, cannot but be taken as authorising the tonsure of the Brahmana, which is clearly enjoined in the Smrtis and as such how could this tonsure ceremony be said to be contrary to the Veda ? Thus then, why should we seek to assume Vedic texts in support of the Smrti injunctions, when these latter themselves can be accepted either as Veda itself, or equal to it in authority.
sambhavatyeva vedatve nityatve cāpi tatsame siddhānāṃ nityataivaikā subodhā vedatāpi vā /	And certainly, the Smrtiinjunctions being themselves wellestablished facts, it is far easier to admit them to be eternal in themselves or they may be accepted to be Veda itself, on the ground of their dealing with the the same subjects as the Veda.
asaṃśayita vedārthaviṣayatvāt prakalapyate yānyeva dharmaśāstrāṇāṃ mūlavākyāni manyase /	Because, as a matter of fact, it is far more reasonable to assume that the texts as we find them in the Smrtis are the very same that we assume to be present in the Veda and this does away with the assumption of a different text for each Smrtiinjunction. And it stands to reason that, while laying down their teachings for the sake of students learned in the Veda, Manu and others could not but have brought forward the direct texts of the Vedas themselves.
tānyevaitāni padyantaityetatkalpitaṃ varam	Conse quently, it would appear that these authors, in their compilations, have only brought together the Vedic texts themselves.
tena tānyeva tairebhyaḥ samprattānīni gamyate / ke hi teṣūpalabdheṣu gṛhṇīyuḥ pratikañcukān	For in the presence of the Vedic texts whose existence all parties admit, who could accept their counterparts as put together in the Smrtis? Then again, inasmuch as we do not find any counterparts of the Dharmaçãstras composed, even till now, we cannot admit the composition of any counterparts of the Vedas.
sampradāyavināśāccegotastad samarpaṇam / manvādiṣtranumoyeta svagranthā karaṇaṃ tathā	It may be argued that Manu and others did not bring together the Vedic texts themselves, for, in so doing, they would have disturbed the continuity of the verbal text of the Veda but by arguing on these lines, we would have to admit that they did not compose the Smrtis.
vedādeva ca vijñāto vedārthaḥ sādhayetphalam / nānyasmātpuruṣagranthānmantrābhāsāt smṛto yathā tathaiva tainna kartavyā brāhmaṇapratikañcukāḥ /	And it is evident that Mana and others did not compose any counterparts of the Mantras, simply be cause they were sure of the fact of the incapability of such counterpart Mantras to bring about proper results and on the same grounds, it must be held that they could not have composed the counterparts of the Brāh manas either as they knew it equally well that Actions that are not laid down in the Veda do not bring about proper results. Nor can it be held that the Smrtis are the orderly collections of Vedic texts scattered in different portions of the various Vedas and as such, they would be the products of human agency.
nāvedavihitaṃ karma phalatīti hi niścitam	Because the Smrtis are distinctly recognised as independent works of a certain form.
īḍagevaṃ kramaśvāyaṃ vedagrantha itohaśī / yujyate hi matiḥ karttuṃ na mūlāntarakalpanā codanālakṣaṇe dharme pūrvamevāvadhārite/	That is to say, it is far more reasonable to hold that there is a distinct Veda in the exact form of the Smrtis themselves, than to assume that they have their basis in assumed Vedic texts. Thus then, is clear that the fact of the Smrtis constituting the Scripture of Action Prayogaçāstra cannot but be admitted, if they are to be accepted as having any authority with regard to Dharma.
avedasya pramāṇatvaṃ brāhmaṇasyāpi neṣyate	For when it has been already ascertained that Dharma is that which has the Veda for its sole authority, anything that is not Veda, even if it be a Brahmana, cannot be accepted as having any authority regarding Dharma.
badanti dharmametāni codanāṃ gamayanti ca /	It cannot be rightly held that they point out the Dharma, and yet have to point to Vedic texts for their authority.
aśakyamīdṛśaṃ vaktuṃ yāvadukta pramāṇakaḥ	can there be said to be an inconsistency in this latter which could be set aside by the said assumption ? for if the mention of the particular Dharma is inconsistent, it is as much so when signified by the Smrtis, as when expressed by an assumed Vedic text.
tasmāddarmaprayogasya sākṣāduktasya tatvayam / pramāṇaṃ dharmaśāstraṃ syānna vedavyavadhānavat	Hence, we conclude that in the matter of that Dharma which is directly mentioned by the Smrti text itself, this text cannot but have an authority of its own, indepen dently of any intercession of the Veda. . Bauddha Scriptures.
yenaivākṛtakatvaṃ hi vedasya pratipādyate / nyāyena tena śākyā digranthasyāpi bhaviṣyati	The fact of the works of Buddha and others being Smrtis having been set aside in a previous Adhikaraṇa, we proceed to show that they have the character of the Scripture of Action Prayogaçãstra, and as such are so many Vedas. We can prove the eternality of the Bauddha scriptures by means of the same arguments that have been brought forward to prove the eternality of the Veda.
akartṛkatayā nāpi kartṛdoṣeṇa duṣyati /	As in the Vedas, so in these scriptures also, their authority is selfsufficient, because of their being perfectly ex we have no doubts as pressive and comprehensible assertions as to their meanings nor have we any mistaken ideas about them. And being, like the Vedas, without a human author, they are free from all discrepancies consequent upon such origin because, as in the Vedas, so in these scriptures also, the possibility of a human author is absolutely denied.
vedavadbuddhavākyādi karṭasmaraṇavarjjanāt	posed by Buddha, or that it was Buddha who saw or found out these scriptures exactly as the names Kathaka, Angirasa and the like are applied to certain recensions of the Veda.
yāvadevoditaṃ kiṃ cidvedaprāmāṇya siddhaye / tatsaveṃ buddhavākyānāmatideśena gamyate	In short, whatever arguments may be brought forward to establish the authority of the Veda, can all be used in proving that of the Bauddha scriptures. To all this, we make the following reply Sutra .
asaṃnibandhanaṃ hyetatpūrvoktaṃ sarvamocyate pareṇa saha keṣāṃ cidvāko vākyāni jalpatām / uktayaḥ prātibhāsikyo jāyante paravākyataḥ	It is Purvapaksha that is taken up first What has been said above appears to be distinctly irregular in its argumentation. As a matter of fact, with regard to any subject, people can have only one correct idea as for other mistaken notions with regard to it, even though they do not appear in the mans own mind, yet if they happen to be borrowed from another person, they cannot but be faulty and incompatible with the former conviction. At the time that one is having a discussion with another person, it often happens that fresh arguments cross up in the disputants mind, being occasioned at that very time, by the reasonings.
yathā mīmāṃsakatrastāḥ śākyavaiśeṣikādayaḥ / nitya evāgamo 'smākamityāḥ śūnyacetanam	Thus it is that the Çakyas, Vaibhāsikas and other Buddhistic sects, being afraid of the arguments put forward by the Mimänsaka, lose their heads completely, and make the astounding declaration that their scripture also is eternal.
ahiṃsādyapyatatpūrvamityāhustarkamāninaḥ / tataśca pairuṣeyatvādaprāmāṇyamatīndriye	But in that case, their scriptures, being as they are composed by human authors, come to be taken as unauthoritative in regard to transcendental matters and in order to save themselves from this predicament they are taken in and led astray from their own path by the semblances of the arguments that have been brought forward by the Mimańsaka to establish the eternality of the Veda.

asmadīyamidaṃ vākyaṃ bhavatāmiti coditāḥ / jalpantyasmākamevaitacchrutvā mīmāṃsa kairhṛtam	And when taunted by the Mimãnsaka on the point of this argument belonging to the Mimaņsaka, and not to the Bauddhas, they turn round and say It is our argument, stolen by the Mimänsaka.
natra śākyaiḥ prasidvā'pi sarvaścaṇikavāditā / tyajyate vedasiddhāntājjalapaiinityamāgamama	And certainly, if one were to shamelessly continue to bring forward such meaningless arguments, thereby seeking to deceive other people, he could never lose his point! But by asserting the eternality of their scriptures, in imitation of the Veda, the Bauddhas give up their wellknown theory of the momentary character of all things.
tathāhi /	They have the following text alsoInasmuch as, in accordance with a rule of the Intellect, a word can be related to a certain definite object, there can be no eternal manifestation of the object by the word because whether the manifestation be held to be brought about by a modification of the senseorgan, or by that of the object in both cases such a manifestation would be highly objectionable, which clearly shows that the Bauddhas have always held the noneternal character of the relations of words to their meanings and under the circumstances, the declaration of the eter nality of the scriptures, in contradiction to the aforesaid theory of non eternality, would only make a laughing stock of the Bauddha.
yastantūnanupādāya turīmātraparigrachāt / paṭaṃ karttu samoceta sahanyāyoma muṣṭibhiḥ	For certainly, if the weaver took up only the threads, and threw away the shuttle, when proceeding to weave a cloth, he would be striking with his fist at the sky.
vyavahāranityatāśabdaśca kriyānityatvaparyyāyaḥ tadyasya śabdārthasaṃbandhānāmanityatvaṃ tasya tadāśrayavyavahāra nityatvaṃ kimādhāraṃbhaviṣyatītyatiduḥsaṃpādam śabdādiṣu vinaśyatma vyavahāraḥ kva vartatām /	So then, the eternality of words, which is the staple wood on which the whole fabric of the eternality of scriptures standshaving been apparently burnt denied, at least by the Bauddha by means of the fire of fallacious arguments, it becomes impossible for the Bauddha to rear up the fabric anew in regard to his own scriptures. As for the eternality of usage of words which the Bauddha admits, it is synonymous with the eternality of actions of words and when the very relations of words and their meanings are declared to be transient, how can any usage based upon these relations be said to be eternal ? because upon what could the usage rest in the absence of the relations? Consequently, those who do not admit the eternality of word, its meaning and the relation between the two, can never reasonably hold the usage, which would have no legs to stand upon, to be eternal.
sthitaiṣā dharmmatetyetadarthaśūnyamato vacaḥ tenānityaśabdavādināmāgamanityatvānupapatteḥ /	Because when the word, &c., will have disappeared, upon what could the usage rest? Hence the assertion This Dharmascripture of the Bauddha is eternal comes to be absolutely meaningless.
māgadhadākṣiṇātyatadapabhraṃśaprāyā sādhuśabdanibandhanā hi te/	of incorrect words and expressions. Being full of vernacular words of the Magadhi and other languages, they are found to be very bad compositions.
mama vidhibhikvatre kammavacca isī save / tathā ukakhitte loḍammi uvve asthi kāraṇaṃ paḍaṇe patthi kāraṇam /	For instance, we meet in them with such expressions asmama vihibhik» khavē kammavacca isīsavē, ukkhittē lodammi uvvē atthi kāraṇam padane nat thi karanam anubhavē kāranam ime sakkada dharmā sambhavanti sakāraṇā akāraṇā vinasanti, anupyatti karanam, and so forth.
tataścāsatyaśabdeṣu kutasteṣvartha satyatā / dṛṣṭāpabhraṣṭarūpeṣu kathaṃ vā syādanāditā	Thus, then, the words themselves being unreal, how could the objects denoted by them be accepted as real? And when we actually find the words to have deteriorated forms, how can we accept them as eternal? Though in the case of the Veda too, we have such fallacious arguments the Veda is noneternal, because it is a collection of words and sentences, like the Mahabharata, &c.yet these can produce an idea of the transitoriness of the Veda, only so long as the actual form of the Veda has not been perceived.
yā tadahiravasthānāīharūpaṃ na dṛśyate /	No sooner are the forms of the Rk, &c., per ceived than the aforesaid conception of their transitoriness disappears entirely.
dṛṣṭārthavyavahāreṣu vākyairlokānumāribhiḥ / padaiśca tadvidhaireva narāḥ kāvyāni kurvate	as Even when we know the mere beginnings of the Veda, we can never intelligently believe them to have been composed by human authors. In the ordinary world, we find that people, following the bent of ordinary experience, compose works of poetry, &c., in connection with the facts of ordinary life only by means of words that are in keeping with ordinary experience.
agnimīle purohitaṃ yajñasya devamṛtvijam / hotāraṃ ratnadhātama mityetannavacaḥ katham agnaḥ purohitatvaṃ ca kva dṛṣṭaṃ yena kīrttyate / ile śabda prayogaśca ka dṛṣṭastotragocaraḥ	And who could ever have composed the greda consisting as it does of words which have almost never been met with in ordinary usage, and which have definitely regulated accents, spreading over sixtyfour Prapathakas? How could the first verse of the Rgveda I adore Agni, the foremost priest of the sacrifice, the glorious Deity, the Inviter, the receptacle of Jewels ever be the assertion of a man? Where could he have found such a metrical method of expression, by the help of which he would compose the verse? What, too, would be his motive for composing it? Where has Agni been seen to be a priest, that one could describe him as such ? Where, too, has anyone met with the word ile in the sense in which it is used in the passage? Where again, has it been found that Agni is the Deity of the sacrifice? Because the Deity of each sacrifice is defined by Vedic injunctions alone.
na jātyā devatātvaṃ hi ka cidasti vyavasthitam / hotṛtvamapi yattasya devatāhāna hetukam	There is no such material class as s Deitya Deity is only the name of one to whom offerings are made, and this could not be perceived by the ordinary means of worldly perception. Nor does any man know the fact of Agni, being either an Inviter of the gods, or a receptacle of jewels and certainly it is not possible to eulogise those properties that one knows nothing of.
śākhācchedopayogaśca puṃbhirutprekṣyatāṃ kutaḥ / evamūjetyayaṃ mantraḥ kena śākhānumāñjane / vaktuṃ śakyo niyoktuṃ vā buddhipūrvakakāriṇā /	Hence we conclude that such assertions could be made only by the Veda as independent of everything else. Similarly in the case of the first mantra of the Yajurveda Grass, &c., how could such an assertion be made by a human being ? How, too, could people know of this mantra being of use in the chopping of the twigs? Similarly, too, how could the mantra “ Urjē, &c., be known by any man, capable of understanding things before he does an act, What man again could to be of use in the washing of the twigs ? lay down that the mantra Vayavah stha is to be used in the separating That is to say, of each calf from its mother at the time of milking it.

That is to say, how could any intelligent person transform the fully expressive words of the verse Agnē āyāhi, &c. into the form O gna, &c., which is never met with in ordinary parlance, and which is incapable of any grammatical construction? So also, how could any intelligent person, unless he had lost his head, transform the correct i in Vibaye, the ta into to, and the ido aya? Thus, then, we conclude, that the form of the Veda itself establishes the fact of its being independent of human agency.

And since this is not enough to convince the logicians outside the Vedic pale, all that the Mimansakā has done is to bring out such arguments from the Veda itself, as go to prove the independence of the Veda of all human agency and thus the Mimańsaka has by this unbelief of the Bauddha only obtained the glorious name of having proved the independence of the Veda, which is really established by the Veda itself.

Thus, then, we conclude that on account of their being composed of in correct words and expressions, the scripture of the Bauddha, &c., can never be held to be either a Veda, or an eternal scripture.
vede yathopalabhyante naivaṃ śākyādibhāṣite / prayoganiyamābhāvādatopyasya na śākhasā	Grammar supplies the only means of ascertaining the eternal and primitive forms of words. And while we find the Veda full of gram matically correct words, we do not find the Bauddha scriptures to be so and thus there being no strict observance of the grammatical forms of words in these latter, they cannot be accepted as scriptures. In this case, the expression asanniyamat would mean because of there being no strict observance of grammatical rules.
kṣaṇikatva nirākṛta nitvatya siddhānityatvātyantā vidyamānagranthaniyamābhyupagamābhiprāyeṇa vā 'saṃniyamādityuktam	Or, the expression asanniyamat may be taken as referring to the absence of any permanence in the Bauddha works, which did not exist prior to their composition by Buddha, as is clearly proved by the Buddha himself, who seeks to establish the transitoriness of all things, on the ground of the momentary character of all that exists.

And hence in matters relating to Dharma, which is amenable only to an eternal scripture as proved under Sutra Ii, we cannot admit of the independent autho rity of the Bauddha scriptures.
kartṛsmṛtyā dṛḍhaṃ jñātā teṣāmapya matāṃ kiyā	In the case of all the Subsidiary Sciences and the Smrtis too, inasmuch as we have a distinct knowledge with regard to their authors, they cannot be accepted as independent scriptures in regard to Dharma.

The arguments that have been brought forward in support of the eternality of the Veda, are not applicable to the case of the Kalpasutras, because of people having firm convictions with regard to their having been composed by human authors. That is to say, just as the teachers and students know of the existence of the Kalpasūtras and other Smrti works, exactly in the same way are they also cognisant of their authors, Açvalayana, Baudhāyana, Apastamba, Katyayana, and others.
na caiṣāṃ samākhyāmātrabalādeva kartṛtvamucyate / yenākhyā pravacanādityuttaramucyate	We do not base the fact of the Kalpasutras having been com posed by authors on the mere ground of their being called by the names of certain persons and hence our arguments cannot be met by the replies advanced under the Sūtra Ii The name is due to their having been explained by certain persons .
tanmantreṣvapyavedatvaṃ kalpādhīteṣu sādhayet /	The fact is that the idea of these authors is brought about by means of an endless traditional conviction and this is only supported by the said names as applied to the Kalpasūtra, &c.
tathā gṛhyopadiṣṭeṣu chāndogyabrāhmaṇeṣu ca	But this would apply also to the case of the mantras that are quoted in extenso in the Kalpas as also to the Chandogya Brahmaṇas laid down in the GrhyaSutras which would also come to be denied true scriptural character and authority.
tena teṣvapyavedatvaṃ svarābhāvātprasajyate /	Because the eight Brāhmaṇas with their esoteric explanations, that are studied by the Chandogas, have got no definite accentuation and this absence of accentuation would make them lose their Vedic character.
tasmāduktasvasaṃvedyarūpābhāvo 'trakāraṇam vahavo vākyaśeṣā hi yeṣāṃ lokeṣvasaṃbhavaḥ /	Consequently we must take the Sutra to refer to the absence, in the Kalpasūtras, of the selfevident eternality and independence of human agency that have been pointed out with regard to the Veda for though the Veda has a definite accentuation, yet this is not all that it has got in contradistinction to other socalled scriptures.
tantravārtike /	Sutra . Also because of the absence of explanatory passages.
abuddhipūrvatāsiddhistena veḍhasya tairapi nityatve sati yeṣāṃ hi kleśena vidhiyojanā /	growing after ten months, and so forth. Specially because, even as we find the Arthavadas in the eternal Veda itself, it becomes extremely difficult to connect them with Injunctions and then, if a human author were to compose such apparently incongruous passages to be taught to his students, he would come to be marked as a fool.
tān kṛtvādhyāpayan karttā sumamatvaṃ vyajennaḍaiḥ vidhiśūnyatayā caiṣāṃ vihitākhyātarūpatā / gamyate na tvapūrvārthapratipādanaśaktatā /	As a matter of fact, however, in the Kalpasutras, we find nothing like such explanatory passages, which could lead us to conclude them to be independent of human agency. And further, the fact of these Kalpasutras, &c., being devoid of any thing like direct Injunctions, distinctly establishes the descriptive charac ter of these that is, since they do not contain any direct Injunctions, they must be taken as mere descriptions or explanations and it also shows that they are not capable of laying down anything new in the shape of Injunctions on Dharma.
varttamānāpaṭeśo 'pi tvarthavādaprarocitaḥ /	In the case of the Veda we find that verbs in the present tense, when rendered attractive by means of Arthavada passages, become endowed with injunctive force.
vidhitvaṃ labhate'nyatra kalpasūtreṣu nāsti saḥ	While in the Kalpa sutras, there are no Arthavadas and as such there is no chance for the verbs in them, which are invariably in the present tense, to have any in junctive force.
yadyapi ṣaḍaṅgameka ityanena kalpasūtrāṇāṃ vedatvaṃ bhavet / tathāpi tarkavatteṣāṃ chandastvaṃ nopapadyate / mantrabrāhmaṇayoreva chāndamā vidhayaḥ sthitāḥ	Nor can it be held that these verbs are in the fifth mood, Let, which has an injunctive signification, and not in the Lat, Present the forms of both being the same because the fifth mood Let has been distinctly laid down, as to be used in the Veda only and as the Kalpa sutras are neither Mantras nor Brāhmanas which two alone constitute the Veda, it is not possible for them to contain any verbs in that mood. Though the declaration that according to some people all the six Subsidiary Sciences are Vedas would make the Kalpasutras known as Veda, yet like the Mimansā, they cannot attain to the position of Veda proper metrical because the regulations of Veda proper metrical apply only to the Mantra and the Brahmana portions of the Veda.

That is to say, the said Vedic text has mentioned the Kalpas together with Itihasas and Puranas which shows that even the products of human agency such as the Itihasas and Puranas are universally admitted to be are included among the sciences to be studied in course of the Brahma yajua. There is yet another explanation of the mention of the name of Kalpa in the Veda.
karmābhyāsābhisaṃdhānaṃ vidhyarthaścātra gamyate sacārthonitya eveti nāpategunthanityatā	this series to be eternal though any particular Kalpasutra cannot be admitted to be independent of human agency.
vedaśabdābhidheyatvaṃ naiṣāmadhyaitṛṣu sthitam / ṣaḍaṅgamekaityetanna ca siddhāntabhāṣitam	As for the points of agreement between the Veda and the Kalpasutras, such agreement is quite explicable on the ground of the latter following or being based upon the former and hence as they only follow what has been laid down in the Veda, the Kalpasutras cannot be said to have any independent authority of their own. Further, no students have ever regarded the Subsidiary Sciences as Veda as for the declaration according to some, all the six sciences are Veda, it by no means expresses the generally accepted theory.
na ca śākhāntaranyāyastulyādvyeṭakatāvaśāt samānādhyeṭakatvātte na kadā cidvidhikṣamāḥ / vivṛṇvantaśca dṛśyante hetubhirbrāhmaṇotthitaiḥ	And again, as a matter of fact, whenever any two declarations are found to agree with one another, it is always concluded that one of them is explanatory of and subsequent to the other and finding such agree ment between the Brahmanas and the Kalpasūtrus, we instinctively con clude that inasmuch as the former is replete with direct Injunctions, it cannot be held to be explanatory of the latter and hence we are forced to the conclusion that it is the Kalpasūtras that are explanatory of, and sub sequent to, the Brāhmaṇas.
tasmādapi svatantratvaṃ kalpānāṃ nopapadyate /	Nor can the case of the authoritativeness of the Kalpasutras be held to be analogous to that of the different recensions of the Veda because of the same persons being the students of the Veda as well as of its Kalpa.
tantravārtika /	explains the meaning dealt with in detail in the particular Veda to which it belongs, and as such the students of both of these being the same, the former can never be admitted to have an injunctive authority apart from the Veda which supplies all necessary authority.
arthekatvena keṣāṃ cidavarāṇāṃ ca sāmyataḥ	Then again, we find that the authors of the Kalpas explain certain facts in accordance with the reasonings supplied by the Brahmanas and as such, the Kalpas can never be held to be equal to the Brāhmaṇas, in authority.
śrutisāmānyamānatvāttasyāpyanyārthatoditā /	We also find that the passage in the Brāhmaṇa has a signification entirely different from what is assigned to it by the explanatory Kalpa and hence too, we cannot admit the Kalpa to be independent of the Brahmanas.
vyācakṣāṇasya vedārthānvedāṃśca vadataḥ svayam	It has been urged above that the Veda itself speaks of the independent authority of the assertions of the great Teachers among whom the authors of the Kalpasutras are included.
ācāryya śabdasyārtho manvādibhiravaṃ vyākhyātaḥ vedasaṃpradānakāle ca śiṣyāstadvacattu kathaṃ nāma śraddadhoran ityevamarthamācāryyavacanaṃ pramāṇamityuktaṃ na kalpasūtrakāravacanaviṣayam	But there too, the word Ācārya in the Vedic text is only a chance coincidence of sound that is to say, the world ācārya in the text does not mean teacher but the Veda itself, the word being explained as that which improves ācinoti the intellect. Or, it may be taken as laying down the absolutely trust worthy authority of the Teacher, with special reference to the students whom he should be teaching the text and the meaning of the Veda. Manu has thus explained the meaning of the word who having initiated his disciple, teaches him the Veda, with all the sub sidiary sciences and esoteric explanations, is called the ācārya and in order that at the time of such teaching of the Veda, the disciples should have an implicit confidence in the words of the Teacher, the Veda has declared the authoritative character of the assertions of the Teacher and this declaration of the Veda does not refer to the authors of the Kalpa One, ācārya sūtras.
tathānyatrāpyuktam /	Sutra . Because of the action being laid down for all cases and because of the proximity of scriptural authority.
tasmād iyaṃ vācā vadati satyaṃ cānṛtaṃ ca pāpmanā hyeṣā viddhyeti sarvatra ca prayuktatvādityanena nidarśyate / sannidhānāca śākhasya visaṃvādaḥ sphuṭaḥ sphuṭaḥ	As has been declared elsewhere Hence it is that speech speaks of both, truth and untruth, because it has been pierced with evil. Such falsity of the assertions of the Kalpasutras is distinctly pointed out by the Veda itself specially as we meet with many assertions that are contrary to one another and to the Veda. This is what is meant to be pointed out by the first half of the sutra the latter half meaning that the contrary scriptural passages being in close proximity, the disagreement or contra diction is easily perceptible.
anumānavyavasthānāttatsayuktaṃ pramāṇaṃ syāt deśadharmmānudāhṛtya saṃpratyetadvicāryyate	Inferences being restricted in their application, usages can have only a limited authority. With reference to certain popular local customs, the present discussion is started the question being as to whether these customs have an authority limited within certain areas, or they have a universal application.
ica sarvaudāhāryyāḥ vicāryyāśca vibhāgaśaḥ /	In this connection, we have got to consider all the Injunctions and Prohibitions that are marked by the acceptance or avoidance by certain people, taking each of these one by one.
prācyā yānanutiṣṭhanti varjjayanti ca sādhavaḥ	There are certain customs that are followed by the Eastern people, though avoided by the exceptionally good amongst them and we proceed to consider whether these customs have been laid down for those people alone, or for all men.
udīcyānāṃ tathācārā vicāryyāḥ sarvaeva te/	In the same manner, there are certain customs that are peculiar to the Southerners, some to the Westerners, and others to the Northerners and we have got to take into consideration each of these.
ādyaṃ sūtradvayaṃ yāvadidamapyatra cinyatām / gṛhyagautamasūtrādivyavasthā sarvagāmite kiṃ tāvatpratipattavyaṃ vyavasthaiveti pāṭhataḥ /	The first two sutras of this Adhikaraṇa viz the th and th sūtras can also be taken as referring to the question as to the locally limit ed or universal authority of such works as the sutras of Gautama, the Grhyasutras and the like. That is to say, we find that, barring the Puranas, the Smrti of Manu, and the Itihasas, all other Smrti works such as those of Gautama, Vaçishtha, Çankha, Likhita, Harita, Apas tamba, Baudhāyana and othersas also the works on Grhyaare each studied exclusively by only certain sections of the Brāhmaṇas, and each of them has its relation restricted to only a definite Veda, exactly like the Pratiçãkhyas.
na hyanyatra sthitāliṅgāniṅgyanyatrānumīyate tacca vyavasthitaṃ dṛṣṭvā liṅgī tatraiva gamyatām /	Inasmuch as we find the sutras being studied only by the parti cular sects of the Brāhmaṇas, we conclude that their authority is also limited to these Brāhmaṇas alone specially as the authority of the sutras is based upon certain assumed texts, which as the objects of inference, can be believed to have an existence only where the inferential indicative the Smrti, exists that is to say, the Smrti sūtras being found to be current only among certain limited sects, the Vedic texts pointed to by these cannot have their existence outside this pale.
vidhirvā pratiṣedho vā na hi so 'nyatra liṅagyate	Hence, whether it be an Injunctive or a Prohibitive Vedic text, its existence cannot be in ferred outside those limits.
anyaveśma sthitāḍū mānna veśmānta ramagnimat / pramoyate na cādṛṣṭadhūmairiti hi niścitam	For example, the per ception of smoke in one house cannot lead to the inference of the existence of fire in another house nor can this latter be inferred by people who have not seen the smoke hence the authortative Vedic text corroborating a Usage can have no authority for those among whom the usage is not cur rent.
yathā ca jātitadbhedakuladharmā vyavasthitāḥ / tathaiva deśadharmādivyavasthāpi bhaviṣyati	And exactly as certain duties and rules of conduct are restricted to certain definite families and castes, so too the duties and the rules of conduct obtaining in a certain country would have their authority restricted to that country alone. If the Prohibitions and Injunctions had a universal application, Usages which are all based upon such Injunctions &c.
sarvaviṣayaśāstrapraṇoto hyācāraḥ sarvadeśagata śaktimatpuruṣairagnihotravadevānuṣṭhīyeta	And then the Usage, based upon the texts that have universal application, would be followed by the capable men of all countries, exactly like the Injunction of the Agnihotra. As a matter of fact, however, we find the usages being followed only by limited classes of people and hence we conclude that the Vedic texts authorising such usages must also refer to these limited communities only.
anyathānupapattyāca śrutira pratīyate /	And as in the case of usages, so also in that of the Grhyasūtra &c., the assumed corroborative Vedic texts can have no relation to those people among whom the Grhyas are not current.
tanmātrānupapattyā ca sā tatraivāvadhāryate yadyannakaraṇaṃ hetuḥ śūrpahome vidhīyate / tanmātragata mevāsa dṛṣṭāntamapi kalpayet	It has been shown under sutra Iii, that, if the fact of the grains having been prepared by means of the çürpa be taken as the reason for making the offering by means of it, then the instance that has been cited would also apply to that alone hence the meaning would be that inasmuch as the çürpa is the means of preparing the grain, the offer ing is poured by means of it and there cannot, in such a case, arise any question as to the offering being poured by means of the darvi or the pithara &c.
evaṃ vyavasthitān dṛṣṭvā deśācārān samaṃtataḥ /	And, in the same manner, as we find all usages to have only a limited local currency, we cannot but conclude that the corroborative Vedic texts inferred in support of such usages, can have only a local application.
tanmātra viṣayā yukta tanmūlaśruti kalpanā api vā sarvadharmaṃ syādityatrottaramucyate /	But the duty must be universal, because of the universal character of the Injunctions. In this sutra we have the reply to the above Purvapaksha On account of the universal charactar of the Injunctions the Dharma çastra, &c., must be taken as applying to all persons capable of performing the duties laid down.
tanyāyatvādvidhānasya śaktamātrādhikāriṇaḥ vidhaiva jñāyate karttā viśeṣeṇa pratikriyam / yogyatvāpratiṣidvatvaviśeṣopapadānvayaiḥ	Having come across certain Smrtis and Usages, when we proceed to infer the Vedic texts in support of these, the inference that we can have must be of such causes as are similar to the effects the Smrtis &c., according to the law that the effect always follows in the wake of its cause. shunned by certain people, the inference is that of a prohibitive text, pointing out the prohibited action as leading to undesirable results in the shape of Hell and the like.
na tvatropapadaṃ kiṃ cidyathācārānusāri yat /	Nor can we infer any texts that could prohibit the said usages, with reference to the people other than those among whom it is prevalent.

But in the cases in question, it is not possible for us to infer the ex istence of one or many qualifying words in the Vedic text, that would in any way specify the persons among whom the authorised usage may be prevalent.
na tāvatprācyatvadākṣiṇātyatvādijātiḥ pratīccodicyādivyativyāvṛttā sarvaprācyā divyaktiṣvanugatā kā cidupapadyate /	Because all denote either the Class or the Individual while in the case in question, any such restrictive words that we would infer could not specify either the Class or the Individual. Because the restrictive words could be only such as the Easterners should perform the Holāka but as a matter of fact there can be no such definite class as the Easterners, which would exclude all the people of the other parts of the country, and include all of the Eastern part and as such we could have no such specification as that the Holāka is to be performed by the Easterners alone.
yāstu manuṣyatvabrāhmaṇatvādijātayasteṣu vidyante tāḥ sarvadeśavāsivyaktiṣvaviśiṣṭā iti nācārānurūpaviśeṣaṇasamarthatvena jñāyante	As for the classes, Man, ‘Brāhmaṇa” and the like, that are found to include the Easterners, they equally include the men and the Brāhmaṇas of all parts of the country and as such could not serve to specify the text as referring only to those people the Easterners among whom the particular custom might be prevalent. As for the words denoting individuals.e., the proper names, they refer to one person only, like Dēvadatta and the like and the presence of such words could not point out the custom as referring to any number of persons.
na hyanantabhedānāṃ prācyādipuruṣavyaktīnāṃ vyastasamastānāṃ savandhānubhavāsaṃbhavādekamabhidhānamavakalpate /	Because there are no individual properties, actions or classes, that could be capable of pointing to particular individual persons, as inhabit ing particular parts of the country as each individual is found to be specified, separately by means of the properties belonging to each singly by himself. Nor do words denote anything other than classes and individuals, and hence there is nothing upon which we could base the specification of the persons for whom the custom may be authoritative.

That is to say, such customs as those of the Holaka and the rest, can not be said to belong either to a particular Class, or to a particular individual. Nor is it possible for us to have any name that would apply only to those people among whom the custom is prevalent.
sarvatra tatrāpi vyāvṛttya viśeṣād / vyaktyākṛti vinirmuktaḥ padārtho na ca vidyate / yamāśritya pravṛttaṃ syādadhikāriviśeṣaṇam	one desiring Heaven, though expressing the meaning that is signified by its component parts, is yet made to signify the whole class of human beings that desire Heaven, irrespective of the gender and number in the word svargakāmah which is in the Masculine Singular on the ground that, as the expression occupies the position of the nominative no significance can be attached to its gender &c., and hence the injunction one desiring Heaven should perform sacrifices is made applicable to all human beings in general.
tathecāpi phalārthitvakartṛśaktyāvabodhanāt / deśadharmeṣu sarveṣu narajāte radhikriyā /	In the same manner, in the case in question, because all local Customs and Observances, point to their being applicable to all persons that desire the particular results following from those actions, and are capable of performing them, therefore it must be admitted that all men in general are entitled to the performance of such actions.

And if some one, desiring to learn the real meaning of the verbal affix asks themwhat is this Bhäva or Bhavana? all that they can say is that it is nothing more than the expression kuryat should do itself because they hold it to be inexpressible by any other word, they can only speak of it by means of the Injunctive affix but any use of the affix by itself being impossible, they have re course to the next best method of uttering the affix in connection with the rootkr to do, which is a common substitute for all verbal roots.
kuryyādityucyamāno hi karomīti prapadyate /	For when one says should do, the man has the conception I do and as such the Vidhi, or the Bhavana as appearing in the word kuryat cannot be said to be either a Class or an Individual.

But if this explanation is renounced, and the passage is taken as pointing out the inexpressibility of the Bhavana which we hold to be denoted by the verbal affixes, on the ground of its being neither a Class nor an Individual, then the passage would become well worth rejecting, on account of declaring what is entirely irrelevant, useless and unreasonable in the present connection. For in that case the passage could be construed with the rest of the sutra, only in the following manner Because the verb cannot denote either the Class or the Indivi dual, therefore the action enjoined by it has an universal application ! And certainly this would be a truly astounding declaration! For all that it would mean is that, if the Injunctive affix, &c., could denote the Bhavana or the Vidhi either as the Class or the Individual, then such customs as the Holaka, and the like, would have only a limited autho rity but because as a matter of fact the meaning of the said affix, &c., is distinct from either the Class or the Individual, and as such, alto gether inexpressible, therefore that which is signified by the said verb. must have a universal authority! And certainly this would serve as a firstrate example of irrelevancy.

And the same process holds good in the case of the usages, &c., that are actually found to belong to only certain particular families and sects such as one sect having one lock of hair, while others have three and so on,all of which point to direct Vedic texts in support of this.

It might be urged in reply, that the word linga being ever depen dent upon that which possesses the Linga or mark, it would always imply the other corelative of its and thereby not losing its efficiency, the Compound would be quite possible exactly as we have in the case of the expressionDevadattasya gurukulam.

In the case of linga” and nityasya, on the other hand, the word linga has its denotation dependent only upon a Lingi, that which possesses the Linga and certainly the word nityasya cannot be said to be in any way synonymous with this Lingi and as such the permanent relationship of the Lingi and the Linga cannot justify the compound nityasya lingābhāvāt.” Though it is true that the word linga is used only where there is a relation of the Indicator and the Indicated, and this relation is eternal yet the denotation of that word does not depend entirely upon eternality, as that of the word Father depends upon that of the word Son, or that of the word Teacher, on that of the word Disciple. And further, it is the word lingi itself which, having its denotation fixed by those of its component parts, depends upon the word linga ” and the word linga does not stand in need of anything besides the verbal root from which it is formed.

Says the opponent All local customs are observed by men, speci fied by such names as Easterners, Southerners, and the like and they are never found to be prevalent among people that are without such names consequently the Vedic texts that are assumed in support of such customs cannot but contain these distinguishing names and as such they must more reasonably be accepted as having only a limited authority.
tasmātmamākhyāviśiṣṭaviṣyanumānāttatsaṃyukta pramāṇapaśca eva jyāyāniti /	To this we make the following reply Because such names are ap plied to the agent on the sole ground of his connection with certain places we conclude that the Vedic Injunction assumed in support of the Cus toms, must contain words that denote the qualifications of place.

That is to say, the restriction of the authorita tive application of the Custom having been accomplished by means of the Names, independently of any basis for themselves, there is no reason for assuming the fact of their being based upon specifications of place, specially when such specification has been found to be distinctly faulty. Se To this, we make the following reply m Sutra The names would be literally significant, like the word Mathura.

And in this case, it is only from ordinary usage that we ascertain the fact of these sounds expressing no meanings, and hence being incorrect. On the other hand, the vernacular words, gavi and the like are found to be cap able of denoting the Cow, just as well as the Sanskrit word go in fact they are quicker than the Sanskrit word in their action of denoting the object, as they are used more commonly than the Sanskrit word.
na kalādivatteṣāṃ pratiṣedhyatvasaṃbhavaḥ avibhaktā hi śabdatvajātiḥ śabdāpaśabdayoḥ /	And hence though all these words are denotative of the single object Cow, yet, inasmuch as they are quite capable of expressing their meaning, they cannot but be recognised as correct exactly as the words hasta, kara, pani,all signifying the handare all accepted to be correct.

That is, we do not accept the authority of a Vedic sentence that would merely describe a certain word to be correct.

And as for the incorrect forms of words, their number is even greater than that of the correct ones and as such it is absolutely impossible for the use of each of these to be prohibited singly, like the prohibition of the eating of kalanja the flesh of an animal killed by a poisoned arrow. In the case of such objects as the Vrihi and the Kalanja, we have distinct notions of the extent of the denotations of these words, as restricted within certain welldefined limits of Class or Property, &c.

taduktaṃ prayogaśāstramiti cennāsaṃniyamāditi / nahi vyākaraṇādīnāṃ vedatvena svatantratā / puruṣādhīnavṛtteśca sāpekṣasyāpramāṇatā	And as a matter of fact it is not possible for even a millionth part of these to be directly declared, and the text that is not directly declared cannot serve as the basis of any Smrti because we have already shown above that the Smrtis cannot be said to be based upon such Vedic texts as can only be inferred and not capable of being ever directly perceived. Nor is it possible for the Injunctions and Prohibitions to be based upon the expressiveness or inexpressiveness of words because all words correct or incorrectare equally expressive.
na ca mṛtyantaraṃ kiṃ cidṛṣṭaṃ tatkāryyagocaram /	Nor is it pos sible for us to have any such prohibition as that No inexpressive words should be used because as there never is such a use, its prohibition would be useless and impossible.

na tāvatsūtrakāreṇa kiṃ ciduktaṃ prayojanam / kathaṃ caitāvati granthe syātprayojana vismṛtiḥ	ness Thus then, in the case of the Science of Grammar, whichever of the three alternatives is employed, it becomes possible to include all cases within a definite compass and as such there may be some sort of definite whereas it is absolutely impossible to have any definite idea of the Injunction and Prohibition with regard to each individual word because it is not possible for us to read up an endless number of sentences.

That is to say, it is only one whose appli cation is uncertain that is restricted in its application by the scriptures while the word has its application or use always certain and as such it can never be an object of restriction. And one that has no application at all e.g., the incorrect word can never be the object with regard to which anything else the correct word can be restricted.

If the correct and the incorrect words were capable of being used with regard to one and the same object, then alone could there be an oc casion for restricting the use to the correct word and rejecting the in correct one but according to you the incorrect word being absolutely meaningless can never be capable of being used anywhere and as such any restriction of the correct word could not serve the purpose of pro hibiting the use of such an incorrect word because it is naturally pre cluded from usage on account of its meaninglessness.
śāstrapūrvaka prayo gapaśe tu jñānasya tadaṅgatvena nirākāṅgabhūtatvāt /	But this is not correct because, as a matter of ordinary experience we find that if one is habituated, either through ignorance or incapacity, to the use of an incorrect word, no amount of scriptures can dissuade him from its use.

And when there is no transcendental result, we cannot assume the correct use of words to bring about an Apurva an unique agency that would bring about certain results in the hereafter. Nor can we ascertain the substratum of this agency of the Apurva that would be brought about by the said Restriction of the usage to correct words because such a substratum could be found only among the fol lowing the Word its meaning the Person addressed the cognition of the word and its meaning the speaker and the utterance. “As for the meaning, though as being the object of denotation, it is the primary factor in the case, yet it is found to be a part of the Word, even in ordinary parlance, where there is nothing transcendental, in the shape of an Apurva and as such the Apurva cannot in any way help the meaning.

As for instance, Patanjali has declared that the knowledge of Grammar constitutes Dharma and Kātyāyana, fearing that such a conclusion would make the knowledge of incorrect forms of words also Dharma as the knowledge of Grammar includes that of correct as well as incorrect forms, de clared that Dharma consisted in the using of words in accordance with Grammar and then again Patanjali reiterates his own theory that it consists of the Knowledge of Grammar.

But it is not so because all Vedic sentences being vyakṛta sancti fied or clarified by a traditional course of study, the sentence quoted refers to these same Vedic sentences that are uttered at sacrifices or during the study of the Veda. That is to say, the Vedic sentence,hav ing its form definitely ascertained by means of the regulations with re gard to its consonants, vowels and accents, as handed down from teacher to the disciple, in the course of an eternal tradition,is spoken of as vyakrta clarified, in contradistinction to all ordinary sentences, which are not so sanctified.
tasyāśca mantrabrāhmaṇātmikāyāḥ karmasu jñāne prayogeca dharmo'styeva /	And certainly there is a Dharma in the knowledge of such Vedic sentences, as composing the Mantras and the Brāhmanas, as also in the performance of actions in accordance with In junctions laid down in these.
yadapi caikaḥ śabdaḥ samyag jñātaḥ suprayuktaḥ śāstrāncitaḥ svarge loke kāmadhumbhavatīti /	The Grammarians quote the following passage from the Veda, in support of the theory that Grammar in itself affords the means of ac complishing Dharma A single word correctly known, duly used, in accordance with scriptures, becomes a means of fulfilling all desires in Heaven and on Earth.
tadapi svādhyāyapraśaṃsāśeṣabhūtameva /	But this also is in praise of Vedic study itself.

Another passage that they bring forward is Hence the Brahmana should not behave like the Mleccha, i.e., he should not talk incorrectly, because an incorrect word verily is Mleccha.
prāyeṇa hi śiṣṭānāṃ dharmācārapraṇihitacetasāṃ kaścideva pramādādalpo 'nācāro bhavati /	But this passage only lays down the prohibition of distorting the traditional readings of the Veda.
gāvyādiśabdaprayogeṣu punarna keṣāṃ cidaṇdhanācārabuddhiḥ / na ca kalādibhakṣaṇava cikitmā gardā vā dṛśyate /	It is only the ordinary expression of the word d that can be un derstood as apaçabda incorrect word, as it would be at variance with Vedic modes of expression and that which is at variance only with ordinary everyday expressions can never be known as apaçabda. Because even such words as gavi &c., which the orthodox Grammarian would call an apaçabda are perceptible by the ear and as such they cannot but be accepted as denotable by the word Cabda, as comprehended under the idea of Cabda, and as included in the class Cabda.

tathāśvalāyanena “pratyasitvā prāyaścittaṃ juhuyuri”tisamāse 'pi lyamna prayuktaḥ /	And as all practices and usages of these foreign countries are prohibited for the Arya, it is only natural that they should avoid their language also.
tathā mīmāṃsāyāmapi gavyasya ca tadādiṣviti gorvikārāvayava viṣayasādhuprayogayogyaḥ śabdo'nyacaiva gavāmayane prayuktaḥ /	And further we can never apply the word Mlec chic to any such words and expressions as gāvī &c., that are current in Aryavarta, because the Aryavarta can never be spoken of as Mleccha and hence these words can never be spoken of as apaçabla specially as an analogous word we have apavrta contrary conduct and this is found to be applied only to such conduct as is not permitted in Aryavarta.
tathā gṛhyakāreṇa mūrdhanyabhighrāṇamiti vaktavye mūrdhanyabhijighrāṇamitya viṣaye jighrādeśaḥ prayuktaḥ /	GC Another passage quoted by the Grammarian isIf one who has taken to the Agnihotra happen to utter an apaçabda, in expiation of this, he should perform the Sarasvati sacrifice.

And as a matter of fact, we do not find the using of such words as gāvi, and the like marked down as an infringement nor do we find people having any doubts or aversion to their use, as they have to the eating of Kalanja flesh of an animal killed by a poisoned arrow.
na hi te suptiṅupagrahādivyatyayena nāpi katipayādhikārahaṭena bahulaṃ chandasītyanena siddhyanti /	And even if we take the cases of a thousand Agnihotris, we do not find anyone of them to be using only such words as are sanctioned by the modern rules of Grammar. Even among the authors of the Kalpas, the Sutras, works on Smrti, Mēmānsã and the Grhyas, many excellent writers are found to be making use of words at variance with the rules of Grammar.
tadyathā madhyaṃ āpasyatiṣṭhati /	For instance, in the Kalpa of Maçaka, we meet with such sentences as Samanamitaram Jyotishtomēna, which is in imitation of the rule Samānamitarat çyenēna, and which has the ungrammatical form itaram in the place of, itarat.
sutarāṃ te 'pi gāvyāditulyāneva prayuñjate / sūtravārttikabhāṣyeṣu dṛśyate cāpaśabdanam /	In the sutras, we read Sadasi stuviran, where stuviran is in the Atmanepada which is a highly un grammatical form as the result of the action of hymning does not per tain to the person hymning, and as such the proper form would have been the Parasmaipada, as in yajanti yajakah.
tathaiva vedasiddhānāṃ śabdānāṃ lakṣaṇaṃ vṛthā rakṣādyapi yadatroktamanvākhyānaprayojanam / na tadapyanyataḥ siddheralapasiddhestato'pi vā	So too we find Açva layana sayingpratyasitva prayaçcittam &c., where the word pratya sitva being a compound, the correct past participial affix to use would have been lyap and not ‘ktuā and again, we find him saying ajyenākshiņi ajya, where there being no compound in ajya, lyap was not the right affix to use. Narada says in his Çiksha pratyushe brahma cintayet, where the word pratyushe instead of pratyushasi. is as ungrammatical as the words gaui and the like.
sa lakṣayettarāmarūpaṃ prakṛtipratyayakramam yadi vyākaraṇādra mancīranvedavādinaḥ / vaiyākaraṇageheṣu cchindyuste vedasaṃśayān	We find Manu him self saying jnātārah santi mētyuktvā, where the correct form would “have been mê ityuktvā, and still he has disregarded the rules of Gram mar on the point and has merged the i of iti into the e of me.” In the Mimānsā, we have the sutra gavyasya ca tadādishu, viiii where the word gavya, applicable, according to approved grammatical rules, to something proceeding from the body of the cow, has been applied in the sutra to the Gavamayana sacrifice.
prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Then again, we have the sūtra dyāvostathēti cet, where the word dyavoh is wrongly used for dyāvā prthivyoh.
tasmātprītairupādhyāyairdiṣṭeḥ kāruṇikādibhiḥ /	So also we find the author of the Grhyas speaking of mūr dhanyabhijighränam instead of murdhanyabhighraṇam.
na vināśayituṃ vedo labhyate tena racyate loke tu sarvabhāṣābhirarthā vyākaraṇāhate / siddhyanti vyavahāreṇa kāvyādiṣvapyasaṃśayam	Through out the Nirukta, we find many words used against all rules of grammar such, for instance, as the assertion brāhmanō bravaṇāt, which occurs dur ing the interpretation of the word brahmana as occurring in the mantra Samvatsaram çāçāyāṇā &c., where the word brāhmaṇa is explained as apylying to one who is capable of speaking or explaining and here the proper form to use would have been brāhmano vacanãt and not brava because in such cases the root bru is transformed into vaci, nāt according the sutra ‘bruvō vacih Panini IIiv.
vaiyyākaraṇadoṣādvi kaṣṭāñchandānprayuñjate / na ca lakṣaṇamastīti prayoktavyamalaukikam /	And as for Purānas and Itihāsas, there is no end of such ungrammatical words in them, as for instance, ubhabhya which is applied by tamers of elephants, Royal Princes and others, to such elephauts as are capable of striking with both tusks simultaneously and this is not in keeping with any rules of grammar.
tena loka 'pi na kadā ciyākaraṇena śabdarakṣā tathā ca etāvatyanyato yasya vinā vyākaraṇānmatiḥ /	Nor can these anomalies in the Veda be said to be in accordance with such grammatical rules as lay down exceptions with reference to the Vedaas for instance, the rules with reference to the terminations &c., are not always observed in the Veda, or that in the Veda there are c many anomalies, and so forth. Because there are certain instances where even these exceptions do not serve to justify the uses.
atha vā yo 'pi gāvyā dillī ke nārthe prayujyate /	g., madhye apasya, where the change of apam into apasya is in no way justifiable so also in nicinavāram, where instead of the word dvāra we have vara which is found nowhere else except in the Lata language.
tenohe karmmakarmmāṅgavākyārthajñāna kauśalaiḥ /	From these considerations we conclude that there is no use of hav ing any rules with regard to the uses of words as are laid down in gram matical works, for the simple reason that no such rules can take in all the words that are used.
aṅgāni jñātināmānyupamā cendriyāṇi ca /	And further, even those who occupy the utmost pinnacle of gramma tical knowledge, are actually found to be making use of such ungrammatical forms of words as gavi and the like.
ṣaḍaṅgo veda ityuktaṃ śrutiliṅgādyapeścayā /	For instance, in the Sutra Pani ni, the Vārtika of Katyayana and the Bhashya of Patanjali, we come across many corrupt forms of words.
taiḥ ṣadbhiḥ pravibhaktaḥ sanma hi kavibodhanaḥ	And certainly those sitting on the horse, could never forget of the horses existence, if they had the slightest intelligence.
saṃbhavavyabhicārābhyāṃ syādviśeṣaṇasaṃbhavaḥ / śrutyādyavyabhicārāttu tairaṅgaiḥ kiṃ viśeṣyate yastāni pravibhaktāni heturūpaphalaiḥ pṛthak / jñātvādhīte sa evāsya vidherathaṃ karoti naḥ	B For instance, we have the sutra Janikartuh prakrtih PaniniIiv , where we find two grammatical mistakes the word Jani signifies the root jan to produce, and certainly the sutra does not lay down the Ablative termination for the producer karta of the root and the word Jani never being capable of signifying that which is produced, Janikarty can never mean the producer, which is what was really meant and hence we conclude that the word Janikarty is as in correct in the sense of producer, as the word açva in the sense of poor.
prātiśākhyāni vā yāni svādhyāyavadadhīyate / gṛhyamāṇatadarthatvādaṅgatvaṃ teṣu vā sthitam pūrvoktanānusaṃdhyānamāgamasya ca nāsti te /	The second mistake is that the compound Janikartuh itself is absolutely ungrammatical, being a direct infringement of the sutra Pani ni IIii that lays down that there can be no compounding with the nominatives ending in the affixes trc and aka as here we have the com pounding of the word kartr kr and tre so also in the sutra prayojako hetuçca, Panini Iiv where we have the compounding of the word proyojaka which ends in aku.
āgamo'dhyayanaprāyaḥ prāvaca śabdānuśāsanam	So also in the Vārtika of Katyāyana, we meet with the sentence, dambhērhalgrahaṇasya jativacakatvat siddham, where the compound jativaçaka is an infringement of the sutra IIii the word vācaka ending in aka.
viparyayāpadeśena pūre kātaraśabdavat tattvāvabodhaḥ śabdānāṃ nāsti vyākaraṇāhata iti, tadrūparasagandhasparśeṣvapi vaktavyamāsīt	And again, we readanyabhavyantu kālaçabdavya vāyāt, and here, in the first place, the compound in ‘ānyabhāvya itself is not easily explicable and even when we are able to explain the com pound, the name compound would preclude the name adjective and as such we would have the affixshyan used in a word which is not an Adjective and this would be an infringement of the sutra of Panini Vi and then too the affix would be absolutely useless, as it would not change the meaning of the original word.
ata eva ślokasyottarārddhaṃ vaktavyam natra kaścidipratipadyate badhireṣvevamadṛṣṭatvāt dhātubhyaḥ kalpite nāmni kriyāyogo 'nugamyate / na cābhidhānavelāyāṃ tatpratītirmanāgapi	In the Bhashya of Patanjali too, we find the expression aviravi kanyāyēna, which is a Tatpurusha compound containing within itself a Dvandva compound aviçca avikaçca = aviravakau, aviravikayoh nyayena= aviravikanyāyeña and here, it was absolutely necessary to delete in the former compound the nominative termination in the firstavih, in accor dance with the sutra of Panini IIiv but this has not been done in the expression cited the correct form of which should have been avya vikanyāyēna.
na tāvatyeva śavdārthaprasiddhirvyavatiṣṭhate /	Nor can the use of the above expressions be justified on the ground of their being nipātas grammatical forms assumed to be correot and as such quite correct.
apetāvayavārtho 'rtho dṛśyate vṛttaśabdavat	We can apply the mechanism of the nipata only to those words that are not found to be subject to any other rules.
dhānapratipattirvaiyākaraṇasya bhavati /	For those however that come directly under certain rules, their use is entirely barred by such rules if the use is against them.
vyavahārāha cirbhūtātvarānnāto 'rthaniścayaḥ	Because we have already shown above that when there is contradiction between usage and Smrti, the latter always s sets aside the former.
yatra tvasti svarajñānaṃ vedavākyeṣva viśrutam / tatra naiva padārthānāmavadhāraṇasaṃbhavaḥ / tatrāpi nirṇayo yaḥ syādarthaprakaraṇādibhiḥ / tatra taireva siddhatvānna svarasyābhidhāṃ gatā	And in the instance cited above, we find the expressions Janikartuh, &c., to be directly against certain distinct rules. A word is said to be correct on the ground of its being a nipata, only when it is not found to be against any direct Rule because in that case, there being no Smrti i.e., Rule applying to the word, the mere fact of its being used is made the ground of assuming a rule relating to the parts of the word and thereby the word may be justified.
vyākaraṇānugamo 'pi cāsya yadi nāma kathaṃ cittadupayogārtha eva bhavet na ta laukika prayogārthaḥ /	W Some people might argue that the rules laid down by Panini are not applicable to the language of the rules the sutras themselves be cause it is impossible for anything to have an action upon itself, and because that which is the lakshana the means of pointing out cannot itself be the lakshya the object pointed out.
atyantāprayuktatvāt	But this is not right because the using of correct words is spoken of as ‘bringing about all desirable results in this world as well as in heaven and because otherwise the mention of one who has taken to the fire Agnihotri would be absolutely redundant in the Vedic text which lays down that if such a person utters an incorrect word he should perform the Sarasvati sacrifice, because the person enga ged in a sacrifice is always one who has prepared the fire and hence if the using of correct words were necessary for him only, it would not be necessary to mention such a person in the above text laying down the Sarasvati sacrifice.
tasmādasaṃdehārthamapi nādhyeyaṃ vyākaraṇam/ na hyetadarthaniścayāṅgabhūtasvara viśeṣaprayogotpattiśāstram /	And hence this text can have no bearing upon the point at issue. Then again in the Mahabhashya, we find that, having put the question which are the words here treated of? the author replies the words Vedic as well as worldly, where the words used in the Veda are re presented as something absolutely different, from those in ordinary use, But as a matter of fact, we find almost all the words in the Veda to be the same that are met with in ordinary usage and as such only a very slight differentiation, if any, was needed. And hence an assertion like the aboveexpressing as it does an absolute difference between them cannot be justified.
yānyapi cemāni bhūyaḥ śabdānuśāsanasya prayojanānītyevamupanyastāni teṣāmapi kāni citprayojanatvayogyānyeva na saṃbhavanti, kāni citprayojanābhāsāni, kāni cidapramāṇakāni /	It is only such words as are spoken of in the sutras as being used in ordinary usage only, that should have been cited as the examples of words in ordinary usage. In the same manner, as examples of Vedic words, the Mahābhashya has citedCunno dēvīrabhish taye &c. &c. but this too is not correct because the words contained in these Çam &c.are also met with in ordinary usage and the parti cular order in which they occur in the particular sentence cannot justify us in speaking of them as exclusively Vedic. Nor does Grammar treat of sentences.
api ca	not Canno dēvi &c.
tatra yastāvatte'surā ityādyasurapurākalpārthavādaprakrame Spaśabdapratiṣedhaḥ prayojanatvenopanyastaḥ sa yathāvasthitastathoktaṃ prāk /	when we find such words as gave and the like being actually used with reference to certain definite objects, how could this wellestablished usage be ever set aside ? As regards the words signifying the names of deities, we have the law laid down under sutra Xiv, which shows that they are employed in the sacrifices in the very form that is pointed out by the parts of the same or other sentences, in accordance with the procedure laid down in the original Injunction, without the slightest reference to any considera tions of the correctness or otherwise of one or the other of the various synonyms of words.
duṣṭaḥ śabda ityatrāpi bahujanaprasiddha śikṣā kārapaṭhitamantrapadodvāreṇa śabdapadaṃ praścipatā svapakṣānurāgo darśitaḥ /	But this also is not correct because grammar does not in any way help us to ascertain the meanings of words or sentences. For as a matter of fact, we find that many doubts with regard to the meanings of words are set aside by the observation of the usage of ex perienced and learned people and the few that are still left are cleared by the help of commentaries, etymological explanations, Kalpasutras, and the persons versed in matters relating to the Veda because all these latter deal with the meanings of words and sentences.
“yaddhotā jāti vāgghi tadyajamānaṃ jahātī”ti evamādibhiḥ sarvatviṃkaprayojyamantravināśeṣu yajamānagāmidoṣadarśanāt /	For instance, grammar points out the word kālēya to be made up of kali and dhak, and the word Vāmadēvya of Vāmadēva and dya and thus according to this, these names as applied to the Samas, would mean the Sāmas seen by Kali and Vāmadēva respectively, whereas in the Veda we find these names of the Sāma explained differently because plenty of riches flow forth from it, the Ṣāma came to be known as Vamadēvya and because the Sama removed all impediments, therefore it came to be known as Kālēya.
tathā cendraśatrurvarddhaskhetimantraprayogavināśadoṣa evodāhṛtaḥ/ yattu nirukte "yadadhītamavijñātaṃ nigadenaiva śakyata” iti ukta, tadasmābhiḥ prathamasūtraevārthaśabdaṃ vyācakṣāṇaiḥ snānasmṛtyatikramakāraṇatvenopavatim /	And as we meet with no differentiation of accents,as that the last word of the compound is acute and so forth,in the usages of these people, any specialities of accents can never be accepted to have an effect upon the significations of words. And if the cognition of the meanings of sentences depended upon the specialities of accents, there would be no cognition of the meanings of those Vedic passages, whose accentuation has not been ascertained. But as a matter of fact, as we find the meanings of such passages duly ascertained by means of Context, &c., independently of the Accents, the denotativeness of those meanings cannot be said to belong to the Ac cents.
anatikrāmanto vedamarthavantaṃ santamanarthakaṃ karupayema, dṛṣṭo hi tasyārthaḥ karmāvabodhanamiti /	And hence we conclude that the accentuation of the Vedic texts can have only an unseen transcendental result specially as it is only found in connection with the reciting of Mantras at the sacrifices in cluded under the ordinary Brahmayajna Daily sacrifices or Duties of the Brāhmaṇa.
tatapracāvyākhyātena vedenārthaprakāśanākaraṇānna tajjvalati tarhi ciditi /	And hence even the grammatical rules that refer to Accents may be said to serve some sort of a purpose with regard to such transcendental matters but never with regard to the words in ordinary usage because Accentuation is found to have absolutely no use in ordinary parlance.
satyamevaitat /	The Mahābhashya quotes the Vedic textThe Asuras ut.
na tu vyākaraṇasya tatropayogaḥ /	the utterance of an incorrect word is behaving like a Mleccha and from this concludes that the use of Grammar lies in protecting us from being a Mleccha.
karmmaprayogotpattiṃ pratyaśāstratvāt/	And it is because the text refers to the mistakes of Mantra that it has cited the use of a Mantraindraçatro vardhasva as an example.
śabdaśāstrametaditi cetteṣvapyapūrvoktena nirmūlatvena na vyavasthā syāt /	Nor can it be asserted that gram mar is a scripture relating to words because we have shown above that there is no basis in the Veda for the rules of grammar that treat of words and as such, these rules cannot be accepted as rightly regulating the use of words either.
tasmātkalpasūtraniruktamīmāṃsānāmevādhītamantrabrāhmaṇārthavijñānopayogakṣamatvādetatprayojanaṃ yuktaṃ, na tu vyākaraṇasya yastu prayuktaityetadapi mantrabrāhmaṇaśabdasya samyakprayogaprayojanameva vijñāyate /	Thus then, inasmuch as the meaning of the Mantras and the Brahmaṇas that one has studied can be ascertained only by the help of the Kalpasutras, the Niruktus and the Mimānsā, the use pointed out by the Mahabhashya should be attributed to these, and not to Grammar which is not found to afford any help in the ascertaining of the meanings of any passages of the Veda. The next passage that is quoted by the Mahabhashya is an expert in the knowledge of the relations of sentences, who makes use of the correct forms of words, obtains victory in the next world while by the use of incorrect words he becomes tainted with sin and from this it con cludes that the use of Grammar lies in this leading to victory in the next world as it is by the help of Grammar alone that we can differ entiate the correct from the incorrect forms of words.
svādhyāyādhyayanādhyāpanayajanayājanagatavedaśabdavināśe 'pi yadṛkto yajñaārttimiyāditi / etadvacanādavagatadoṣānuvādo 'potyavagamyate /	But this passage also refers to the fact of the use of the correct forms of Mantras and Brāhmaṇas bringing about excellent results exactly as the use of the incorrect forms of thesei.e., not as they appear in the Veda taints the person with sin and as such, we take the passage to be supplementary to another Vedic textIf the sacrifice fails in regard to the verses recited, &c, &c., which speaks of similar results follow ing from the distorting of the reading of the Veda, during its reading, teaching, sacrificing, either directly or indirectly.
vāgyogaviditi santravārtika /	Hence we take the expressionone who is expert in the knowledge of the relations of wordsto mean the person who is fully cognisant with all relationships.

For these reasons we cannot take the expression to mean the Grammarian because Grammar is found to have no bear ing upon the aforesaid facts in connection with Mantras and Brah manas. The fifth text quoted by the Mahabhashya is when the person saluting another is ignorant of the fact of the last vowel of a name being te, the person saluted should response as to a woman and from this it concludes that if we wish to avoid the treatment accorded to women, we should learn Grammar, which is the only means of learning the acuteness, &c., of vowels.
na ca tāvatā ma nvādibhiranena codāhṛtena ślokena prakṛtipratyayādivibhāgadvārepaṇa śabdāpaśabda vikekajñānaṃ tadupayogo vāśrīyate /	But the fact of a vowel being acute is well known through ordinary usage and as such the condition laid down by Manu in the passage quoted being fulfilled by ordinary usage itself, any science dealing with these conditions of acuteness, &c., cannot be admit ted to the position of a scripture relating to the performance of actions. Nor does the above passage serve to point out either the fact of the differentiation of the correct from the incorrect forms of words being necessarily due to a knowledge of the roots and affixes as dealt with in grammatical works or to that of such knowledge being of any use in the said differentiation.
yacca pra yājāḥ savibhaktikāḥ karttavyā iti tadyājñikopadeśasiddhatvād brāhmaṇe ca ṣaḍaha vibhaktayaḥ “agnirvṛtrāṇi jaṅghanat” / “agniṃ vo vṛtrahantamam” agnināgniḥ samidhyataityevamādivibhaktavibhaktiprayogadarśanādantareṇāpi vyākaraṇaṃ vaibhaktikamātralocanenāpi vā savibhaktikaprayājaprayogasiddhe, raśāstraṃ vyākaraṇam /	The sixth passage cited is the Injunction The Prayâjas are to be performed with due attention to the grammatical terminations which is taken as laying down the necessity of learning Grammar which is the only means of knowing the terminations. But in the first place a knowledge of the terminations here spoken of is very easily acquired by means of the direct teachings of persons versed in sacrifices secondly, all the seven terminations are found to be enumerated in the Shaḍaha section of the ChandogyaBrāhmaṇa and lastly, we find all these termina, tions duly pointed out in the Mantras themselvesas in Agni nomi native killed the Vrttras, we address Agni in the accusative the killer of Vrttra, and the fire is lighted by the fire Instrumental, and so forth and all this shows that even without the grammatical works, we can have a due knowledge of the said terminations, by merely paying due attention to the words having the terminations as they are met with in ordinary usage and thus thereby the said Prayaja being duly per formed, Grammar cannot be held to be a scripture bearing upon its due performance.
“yo vā imāṃ padaśaḥ kharaśo vācaṃ vidadhāti sa śrāvijono bhavatī” ti samyagvedādhyāyyevamabhidhīyate /	But as a matter of fact, this passage only speaks of the person who has duly learnt the Veda.

But in dealing with the four kinds of words as mentioned in this passage, the Niruktas have, in accordance with their own maxim that all words are to be explained in accordance with the similarities of the letters therein contained,spoken of many quartets, such as a the Pranava together with the three Vyahrtis, b the four Vedas, c the four kinds of speech, Para, Pcyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari and certainly in regard to none of these can Grammar serve any useful purpose. Even if the quartet referred to be taken as that consisting of Nouns, Verbs, Prefixes, and Nipatas, even then, inasmuch as all these are learnt from ordinary usage itself, a knowledge of these could not stand in need of grammatical study.
caturṇāmapi padajātānāṃ manuṣyairucyamānatvāt /	But in reality, this cannot be taken as the quartet referred to as in that case, the sentence it is the fourth kind alone that men make use of would be absolutely inexplicable, as men are actually found to make use of all the four kinds Nouns, &c..

ṣaṭapramāṇīmadhyāca pramāṇadvayaṃ vāvapadatvādapoddhṛtam / abhāvastāvadabhāvaviṣayatvādeva vākpadaṃ na bhavati /	Out of the six means of right notion, generally accepted, two have been totally removed from doing anything with regard to the cognition of speech one of these is Negation, which refers only to nonexisting objects and as such cannot help in the cognition of speech another is Verbal Testimony and this in itself consists of speech only and as such being a receptacle of that speech which has to be cognised, it could not be accepted as the recep tacle of that which brings about the cognition. Or, it may be that, that which is amenable to Verbal Testimony is that which is directly ex pressed in words and as such this being included in Auditory Sense perception, is not mentioned separately.

But this Mantra is spoken of witli reference to the butter used by the Priest at the Vishuvat sacrifice and what its real meaning is we have already explained in the Adhikarana of the nd pada of this Adhyāya dealing with Mantras under the Sutra Iii.

tādṛśaṃ ca vaiśeṣikādiṣvapi tadabhiyuktaḥ śakyaṃ yojayitumityanādaraṇīyam /	which is taken as the praise of one knowing the science of words, and as such, laying down the necessity of studying Grammar.

There is yet another passage quoted which speaks of the science of words having a purifying tendency like the sieve and this the Mahabhashya has taken to mean that it is the study of Grammar that purifies all usage of words. But as a matter of fact the passage is in praise of a due knowledge of the meaning of the Vedic text, purified by a long course of uninterrupted study.
“āhitāgnirapaśabdaṃ prayujye”ti, vyākhyātamevaitat /	The passageIf the Aginhotri happens to use an incorrect word he should perform an expiatory ritehas been taken by the Mahābhashya to signify the necessity of grammatical study. But the real signification of this passage we have explained above.

But, as a matter “of fact, these expressions having a verbal affix and the like, could not but have been borrowed by writers on Grammar from the vocabulary of the day, which must have had a prior existence and as such even now can very easily learn what they mean even without the help of a grammar as for the number of letters in a name, it is a fact of ordinary perception accompanied by memory and as such not dependent upon we any grammatical rules, &c. as for the characters of the letters, &c., these can be learnt from the explanations contained in the Çikshas and the Pratiçakhyas.

yāni ta prayogarūpāṇi tāni tu loke veda ca vibhāgaśaḥ pratyakṣāpayeveti na vyākaraṇāpekṣayaivamabhidhīyate /	But as a matter of fact all that grammar does is only to attribute the name terminations Vibhaktis to certain letters, &c. but even this name it may have only borrowed from ordinary usage while so far as the words made up of these terminations are concerned, they are found by themselves both in the Veda and in ordinary parlance and there can be nécessity of learning grammar on this score.

And all these being matters dealt within the historical and sacrificial portions of the Veda, there can be no need of grammatical study on the score of these.
saṃskṛtānāṃ ca śabdānāṃ sādhutve parikalpite / vaktavyaḥ kasya saṃskāraḥ kathaṃ vā kriyate punaḥ	You seem to hold that it is only the words grammatically purified Pata that are correct and now it is for you to explain what it is that is puri fied, and in what manner. That is to say, if grammar be held to help in the purification of words, it is not very easy to ascertain what it is that is purified and also whether the purification is in the shape of produc tion, or acquisition, or modification, or fructification into an Apūrva, or the bringing about of a fresh potency.
na tāvadasti śabdatvavarṇatvavyaktisaṃskriyā / sarvatrātiprasaṅgena na vyavasthā hi sidhyati	In the first place it is not possible for any individual of the class Cabdatva or of the class Varnatva to be the object purified because this would apply to all words and letters, and as such there could be no restriction of the correct or the incorrect. And if the class Cabdatva were held to be the object purified, then any ordinary sound that of the beating of the drum for instance would also come to be spoken of as correct.
etena varṇavyaktisaṃskāraḥ pratyuktaḥ	And if the class Varnatva were held to be that object, then the letters contained in the words, gāvī, &c., being letters? .
samudāyastu naivāsti teṣāmayugapacchateḥ	as much as those in gauh , the case of these would be exactly similar to that of the words gauh and the like.

And thus all indivi dual letters having been purified, no word could ever be rightly held to be incorrect.
tataśca sutarāṃ prāptā prayogotpattyaśākhatā atha vyākaraṇotpannaiḥ śabdaivedo'pi nirmitaḥ /	And as for the purification applying to the collection of letters, this cannot be possible, as no two letters being heard simulta neously, there can never be any conglomeration of these.
tasmādaniyamaṃ mukkā nityaḥ saṃskriyate yadi / vikriyākhyo'pi saṃskārastato naivāsya saṃbhavet	Those again, who hold all individual letters to be undergoing momentary destruction, can never have any purification of letters as each letter being destroyed no sooner than produced, there would be nothing left to be purified and hence even though the letter be an entity, it can have no existence at the time of the purification, it having disappeared, even at the time that we may be thinking of purifying it.

That is to say, in the case of the sentence, offers the flour, the flour offered into the fire having been burnt up by the fire, and as such becoming in capable of being seen or used again, if the Accusative ending in saktun be made the ground of accepting the view that the flour is purified by the fire, then, in that case, every factor of the Injunction offers the flournamely, the Flour, the Offering, the Bhavana and the Injunction itselfwould be absolutely meaningless and for this very reason we hold that there is no purification of the flour in the offering.
varṇasaṃskāramātraṃ ca yadi vyākaraṇād bhavet /	Exactly in the same manner, there would be a meaninglessness of all things concerned, if we admitted of a purification of the momentarily disappear ing individual letters.
pratyācāreṇa tatmidvernottaraṇa prayojanam na ca sthalavadārambho varṇaiḥ śabdasya kasya cit / yena tatsaṃskṛtiḥ siddhyetma_hi pūrvaṃ nirākṛtaḥ	And the declaration of uncertainty in the Bhashya, as whether the word be eternal or transient, the definition of grammar is equally applicable only shows, on the part of the author, that he has either been purposely fighting shy of the above arguments, or simply trying to hoodwink his disciples and as such we cannot accept it.
saṃkhyāmātrasya sādhutvaṃ tacca syāditareṣvapi grahaṇoccāraṇe eva saṃskārye yadi manyase /	Specially as it is only in regard to an object that is removed from us that there can be any uncertainty for who is there that has any uncertainty as to whether fire is hot or cold? If however the word be held to be transient, then, the only puri fication sanskāra that could belong to it would be production and as such it becomes all the more impossible for Grammar to be a scripture dealing with the usage of words.
karmmaṇaḥ karmmasādhyatvamupariṣṭānniṣetsyate karṭaguṇe tu karmmāsamavāyādākyabhedaḥ syāditi	That is to say, the grammarian, holding all correct words to be produced by the rules of Grammar, himself rejects all possibility of Grammar either having a basis in the eternal Veda, or being a part of it because that which is admitted to be transient can never be a part of that which is eternal.
śabdānuśāsanaṃ śāstramiti vyarthaṃ tadā bhavet	If the Veda itself be said to have been composed by means of the words produced by Grammar, then the Veda would also come to be as unauthoritative as Grammar itself.
sphoṭaśabde ca saṃskāraḥ sutarāṃ nopapadyate / asantau tatra hi syātāṃ prakṛtipratyayāvapi	And again, if the word be held to be produced and as such momentary, it would have no existence apart from the moment of its production and as such, there could be no purification of it nor could such a word be of any use.
apodvāreṇa saṃskāro yadyatrābhyupagamyate /	And as for the purification in the shape of Acquisition or perception, this is found to be accomplished by means of the sense of audition, without any action of Grammar. as the means of such purification.

ancācaścīta śāstraṃ cecchabdānasadapoddhṛtān /	Nor do we find the gramma tical rules to be laid down in connection with the performance of sacri. fices and as such they cannot be held to bring about the purification of words, serving to accomplish a certain Apurva or unseen Potentiality or Agency.

arthena ca prayuktānāṃ śabdānāṃ saṃskriyoditā / vākyamevaṃvidhaṃ ceṣṭaṃ na padānyarthavajjanāt	to be the object of purification but such a sequence residing only in the hear ing or the pronunciation of the word, cannot be accepted as a property of the word itself and as such the purification of the sequence could not a fight Cat affect the word and moreover, inasmuch as there is a certain sequence in the words gavi, &c., also a purification of the sequence would be applicable to these as well as to the Sanskrit words.

As for the Sphota of sentences, which some people hold to be devoid of all component parts, a declaration of the purification of the nouns and verbs as forming these sentences would be exactly like speaking of the horns of a hare! If it be urged that we can speak of the purification of the nouns, &c., as extracted out of the syntactical Sphota, then it could be as reasonable to speak of the purification of the horn as extracted out of the hare! If you hold the extraction of the part of the sentence to be accom plished through the similarity of the part of other things, then, why can not the extraction of the hares horns be equally accomplished through the similarity of the horns of the ass? As for similarity too, we have spoken of a certain sort of similarity existing between the parts of the body of the gavaya and that of the Cow but in this case we actually perceived a similarity between real parts and do you employ the same arguments to the present case, where the parts spoken of are only imaginary? The fallacy of this we shall show in detail under the Vakyadhikaraṇa in Adhyâya II.
tataśca	And hence the assumption of extraction too is by no means admissible.
tena sarverbhāṣitavyaṃ sarve sādhava ityatra pramāṇaprayogāḥ evaṃ sādhutvameteṣāṃ sarveṣāmarthasādhanāt /	And hence we should make use of all words they are all equally correct. And on this point, we have the following arguments The words gavi,goni, &c., are equally expressive of the cow, because they are used in that sense by experienced peopleexactly like the words gauh, usra, and the like. All these are correct words because they are found to denote a certain objectlike the words, gauh, &c. They are not corruptions, because they are comprehensible by the ear like the words gauh, &c.
śrautratvānnāpaśabdatvaṃ pūrvadṛṣṭāntadarśanāt sādhubhirbhāṣamāṇānāṃ nādṛṣṭaphanna saṃbhavaḥ / dṛṣṭārthatvādyathā dhūmādagniṃ deśe 'vagacchatām	M They are all eternal because we cannot trace their usage to any beginning in time, specially as, just as in the case of the word gauh, so in that of these also, we can always find one speaker prece ding the other ad infinitum. Those that utter only grammatically correct words cannot, by that, attain to y transcendental result because they are all found to accomplish the visible purpose of expressing a meaning just as the per ception of smoke leads to the cognition of fire and not to any transcen dental result. The grammatically correct words cannot bring about trans cendental results, because they are not the subjects of perpetual Injunc tions, exactly like the words of Buddha.
vedamūlatayāpyasya pramāṇatvaṃ na kalpate / aveda viṣayārthatvānnāṭakādinibandhavat / śākhāṅgamapi naivaitadatādarthyātkathādivat /	Grammar cannot be held to be a scripture because it has not the form of the Veda exactly like the explanations of the formations of Vernacular words. The authority of Grammar cannot be held to rest upon the fact of its having its basis in the Veda because it is not found to deal with the subjects that are treated of in the Veda exactly like dramatical works, &c. Grammar cannot be a part of the Veda because it is not found to serve any purpose of the Veda exactly like an ordinary story, &c.
yathā hi cakṣurādigrahaṇānapeśśarūpādivijñānasiddhau tajjanitārthāpattiprabhavaṃ cakṣurādyanumānamupajātamapi na pūrvajñānasyāṅgamevaṃ lokavedasiddha śabda prayogottarakānapraṇītatayā vyāka raṇamapyanaṅgam	Nor can Grammar be held to be a necessary appendage to the use of words because it is capable of being propounded only when the usage already exists. appendage is found in the case of the inference of the eye. That is to say, the perception of colour being accomplished, independently of the perception of the eye, even though the impossibility of the former perception in the absence of the eye distinctly points to the inference of the existence of the eye, yet this latter inference is not admitted to be a necessary appendage of that perception exactly in the same manner, inasmuch as Grammar is found to have been composed long after the usage of wordsboth Vedic and ordinaryhas been an accomplished fact, it cannot be admitted as a necessary appendage of such usage.

But we pro ceed to show the doubtful character of this Apparent Inconsistency, by proving that the said usage and expressiveness are explicable other wise than by accepting the words to be eternal. When a word is found to be never used, except in its expressive character, then alone can the expressiveness of the word be admitted to be proved by the facts of its usage and expressiveness.
yadi hyekāntena yādṛśaḥ paramukhācchandaḥ śrūyate tādṛgeva sarveṇa sarvadoccāryeta tato vṛddhavyavahāraparaṃparāyāṃ satyāṃ gavādibhiriva na gāvyādibhiḥ kaścidapi kālaḥ śūnya āsīdityadhyavamāyādanāditvamaṅgīkriyeta /	That is to say, when a certain conclusion to the contrary has been laid out in an exceptionally strong manner, if one proceeds to immediately point out the true theory, it involves a very hard work and hence with a view to lighten this burden, the present sutra proceeds only to weaken the contrary view by throwing it open to doubt. Or, the words gāvi &c., having been declared to be eternal on the ground of their being accepted in wellestablished usage, the present sutra may be taken as throwing such eternality open to doubt, by show ing that there is likelihood of there being discrepancies in such usage. That is to say, if it were always the case that the word pronounced by one man is exactly like that which he has heard from others, then alone could longestablished usage justify the conclusion that, as in the case of the words go &c., there has been no time at which the words gavi &c., have not been in use and this conclusion would justify us in accepting these latter to be eternal.
aparādhajasya śabdasya saṃbhavāttu tadāśaṅkāyāṃ satyāṃ naikāntataḥ sarveṣāmanāditvam / prayatna niṣpateriti pūrvektanyāyāvadhāritaprayatnābhivyaktireva hetutvenopadiśyate /	But as a matter of fact, we often find the pronounciation of words to be due to certain discrepancies or mis takes and as such the continuity of the usage being doubtful, it cannot warrant any conclusion as to the eternality of all words. The expression accomplishment being due to an effort means that be cause the word is manifested by means of an effort in accordance with arguments detailed above in the section on the Eternality of Words, Çlokavārtika. This is added because the Mimānsaka holding the word to be eternal cannot admit of its being produced by any effort.
prayatna niṣpatteraparādhasya bhāgiteti /	Some people read the sutra as aprayatnanishpatteh &c.
yadā tvaprayatna niṣpattirapi śabde saṃbhāvyate tadā tatrāparādhajarūpāntarāpattiprasaṅgāmna niyogataḥ sarvaśabdānāṃ samānavidhānatvam /	and they explain it thus In the case of a man for whom the word is manifest ed by means of an effort complete in all respects, all words being pro nounced in accordance with a longestablished tradition, they would all be equally authoritative but it is often found that words are manifested by means of incomplete or faulty efforts and in these cases, it is highly probable that the word that is pronounced may be at variance with the established usage and hence all words cannot necessarily be held to be equally authoritative.
atha vā śabdaviṣayasya prayatnasyaiva yā niṣpattiḥ tasyāmaparādhaḥ sunipuṇānāmapyavikalakaraṇānāṃ dṛśyate kimutānipuṇa viguṇakaraṇānām	Or, it may mean that the completion of the effort to manifest or pronounce a word is found to be tainted with certain discrepancies, even in the case of clever people with all their organs of speech intact what then can be said of the words pronounced by ignorant persons, having deficient organs of speech, &c. ? And the discrepancy that is found in the effort to pronounce the word, cannot but affect the word that is manifest ed or uttered by that effort.
sāparādheghvasādhutvaṃ vyavasthaivaṃ ca tatkṛtā avinaṣṭe vinaṣṭe ca dṛśyete sādhvasādhute / tathā sati ca taddārā siddhiḥ śabdāpaśabdayoḥ	Thus then, we conclude that those that are pronounced by a faultless effort are correct while those whose utterance is due to certain discrepan cies in the effort, are incorrect and there is nothing that can be said against this criterion. As a matter of fact, even in ordinary parlance, we find that, that which is not destroyed is called good, and that which is destroyed is pro nounced bad and such being the case, the existence of the correct forms of words, as also that of their corruptions, becomes possible by the same means. That is to say, the word whose usage is found to be eternal may be pronounced to be correct, while that of which the use is not found to be so may be held to be a mere corruption.
dharmādharmavyavasthā hi satyānṛtanibandhanā / vihitapratiṣidvatvāttayośceṣṭā saśākhatā	would have a useful bearing upon a consideration of Dharma or Adharma. Truth being enjoined and untruth being prohibited, we can easily make these the means of ascertaning Dharma and Adharma and certainly it cannot be doubted that these matters are really the subjects capable of being treated of in a scripture.
evaṃ sati vyavasthāne bhacyābhacyavibhāgavat /	As for truth too, just as we have a truth of matter, so also we have a truth of words and a verbal untruth is to be avoided as much as an untruth of fact.
prayogotpattyaśāsvatvāditi detorasiddhatā	Or, the sutra may be taken as offering a reply to the following argument urged above Inasmuch as it is only the word that is correct.
sādhornityaprasaktatvāda sādhoraprasaṅgataḥ /	And the sense of the reply is this Inasmuch as there is a chance of discrepancies in the pronouncing of words, there is always a probability of both contingencies.e., it may not be the correct word that is always used, and it may be the incorrect word that is used.

But as a matter of fact, there always being certain discrepancies in the effort to pro nounce the word, the chances of the use of both the correct word and its corruptions are very nearly equal and as such the science that lays down the rules with regard to the use of the correct word cannot be said to be absolutely useless.
eka evāyaṃ śabdaḥ puruṣāśaktipramāikāraṇādibhedāttāṃ to varṇanyūnātireka kramānyatvādyavasthāmanupataṃ stena tenāpabhraṃśarūpeṇa gṛ hyamāṇastamevārthaṃ pratipādayatīti na paryyāyakalpanayā vācakaśabdānta ratvaikānta siddhiḥ / kiṃ ca /	As a matter of fact, we often find that through the inherent incapacity or carelessness of the man pronouncing it, a word is often distorted, being pronounced with a letter too short or too many, or in a different form altogether and yet, though uttered in these corrupted forms, it is found to express the same thing that is expressed by the correct word. But as these corruptions are distinctly found to be due to a discrepancy in the pronouncer, they cannot be accepted as synonyms of the original correct word, and as independent words by themselves expressing the same meaning.
devadattādināmāni niḥsaṃdigdhāni yāni ca / bālaistattādirūpeṇa nāśyante taiśca saṃśayaḥ apabhraṃśāca ye kecidraḍhā gāvyādayo jane /	And again, even in the case of the names Dēvadatta and the like, with regard to which there can be no doubts, we find young boys distorting them into the words tatta and the like and this instance leads us to think that the corruptions gavi, &c., are also due to certain discrepancies in the persons seeking to pronounce the word gauh exactly as the boy wishing to pronounce the word Devadatta, but being incapable of right ly pronouncing it, utters it as Tatta. That is to say, we actually find the object Devadatta being duly expressed by the corrupted form Tatta as pronounced by the child, or by the grownup man imitating the child and as such how can we accept a word gave f.i.
tepi gāvyādirūpeṇa nāśyante vyabhicāritāḥ	to be really expressive of a certain object, on the mere ground of its being used and expressing a definite object ? Then again, even in the case of the corrupt forms gāvī and the like, that have become current in ordinary usage, we often find these also being corrupted into these forms, and yet succeeding in denoting the cow.
anyathoccāryyamāṇaśca śabdo 'pabhraśyate yathā / tathā heturanaikānlādvetvābhāsatvamṛcchati	Just as a word, being pronounced otherwise than in its real form, falls from its true expressiveness, so does an argument, becoming doubt ful, fall off from the position of correct reasoning! Thus then, we conclude that even if a word is found to be current in ordinary usage, it is necessary that we should consider whether or not it is really and correctly expressive of the sense in which it is used.
saṃśayāpādanātparapakṣejite 'pi svapaścasiddhidubhavetyevamarthamuttarasūtram	And this is what is sought to be ascertained by means of the following sūtras. Though the theory of the opponent has been rent asunder, yet our own theory is far from being thoroughly established and hence we pro ceed with the next sutra.
vācyavācaka sāmarthyaniyamo yobhidhāgataḥ / saṃbandhastadanekatve svarūpātmo 'pi dīyate	That is to say, it is only when the word and its meaning are very closely related to each other, that the one necessarily implies the other, and as such there is a fixed mutual relationship and hence if either of these either the word or the meaningwere to be diverse, there would be a diversity in the said relationship, which would thus lose all its fixity.
sāmarthyaṃ sarvabhāvānāmarthāpattyāvagamyate / ekasāmarthya siddherthe nānekaṃ tacca labhyate /	And further, it is only by means of Apparent Inconsistency that we infer the potentialities of all things and the expression of a meaning being quite explicable through the potentiality of a single word, there can be no ground for assuming any others.
atyantādṛṣṭā hi vāccapratyayānyathānupapattimātra pramāṇikā vācakaśaktirekacaiva kalpitā tadanusāryyapabhraṃśeṣvapi cedanugamyate, ko nāma tannirapekṣavācaka śaktyantarakalpanāṃ labheta	And when this potentiality is once assumed as belonging to a certain word, if it were sought to be attributed to its corruptions also, how could any such word be assumed to have the potentiality, in the absence of the aforesaid inexplicability or inconsistency ? Further, a name is given to a thing, simply for the purpose of talk ing of it in ordinary parlance and as this usage can be accomplished by means of one only, the assumption of other names is absolutely useless. When a Then again, if many words be held to be alternatively expressive of the same meaning, then this would be open to all the eight objections that have been urged above against all alternative courses.
nāmāntare śrute cārthastadbhinno 'nyaḥ pratīyate / saṃjñā cotpattisaṃyogāditya caitadvadiṣyate ekaśaktyanusāreṇa yāvattvasti gatiḥ ka cit /	certain object is known by a certain definite name, whenever any other name happens to be pronounced, it brings about the idea of another object all this we shall explain under the sutra IIii. As for such universally recognised synonyms, as hasta, kara, &c., we accept all these many words to be expressive of the same object, be cause all of these being equally authorised by the smrtis, there can be no other way out of it. While so long as we are able to depend upon the potentiality of a single word, we explain the denotation of the meaning by other words corruptions to be due to Analogy and Inference.
yathā ca prakṛtisārūpyadvāreṇāpabhraṃśāḥ prākṛtīmeva śaktimāvirbhāvayanto 'rthapratipattāvupayogaṃ gacchanti, tathā tadaśaktisyānurūpatvādityatra varṇayiṣyate /	As a matter of fact the corrupted forms of words become capable of expressing a meaning, only by manifesting the potentiality of the original word, through their similarity with it this the Bhashya will explain in detail under the sutra Iiii. Thus then, it must be admitted that when many words are found to be used with reference to the same meaning, it is only one that can be really related to that meaning all the rest are due a certain incapacity in the speaker to pronounce the correct word, and are capable of denoting the meaning, only through the intervention of the original word, which is indicated by them through their similarity with it. It is often urged that when many words are found to be equally cur rent in usage and capable of expressing their meanings, it is impossible to ascertain which one of these is the real original word.
tenāneka prayoge 'pi kaścidevārthasaṃgataḥ /	And in view of this assertion, we have the following sutra.
tadupasthāpane nānye bodhakāstadaśaktijāḥ	That expressiveness could be ascertained by means of the particular instances of close application or learn ing.
prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	At the very outset, there arise the questionswhat is the learning? what the particular instances ? how too could the expressiveness of words be ascertained by means of such instances ? And we proceed to ex plain all these points.
svakṣaṇaśravaṇābhyāsādabhiyogaḥ pravarttate /	Learning proceeds from listening to and carefully studying the various generic definitions or rules while the particular instances re fer to an application of these rules to particular cases.
tena lakṣyāntarajñānaṃ tadviśeṣo 'bhidhīyate	B Hence it follows that, without the help of Grammar, neither the Veda nor ordinary parlance could ever enable us to get at an idea of all the correct words. And unless all the correct words have been known, we cannot arrive at any notion of those not included among these and as such no Apparent Inconsistency could lead us to any knowledge of the incorrect.
tatmāmakhyāparijñāne pāriśeṣyānirūpaṇāt / arthāpattyāpaśabdānāṃ niścayo nopapadyate	And it is only when the general definition of correct words has been duly obtained, that a word being found to be used in a form not in keeping with the said definition, we would at once conclude it to be of the opposite kind and it is then alone that Apparent Inconsistency could help us in arriving at an idea of the incorrect words.
tenobhayajñānasyāpi vyākaraṇamevopāya iti tadgatābhiyogaviśeṣāśrayaṇam /	In the foregoing sutra, it has been urged that as the grammatical rule cannot have its basis in the rule itself, it must have it in usage, and thus the rule would be based upon usage, and the usage upon the rule, there being an inadmissible mutual interdependence.
yattu prayogotpattiśāstratvāditi lakṣaṇe tanmūlāsaṃbhavāditaretarāśrayatvamuktaṃ, tallokavyavahāraprasiddhapratipādakatvamātreṇānirṇītapāramārthikavācakatvairapi vyākaraṇāvayavabhūtaiḥ padaiḥ keṣāṃ citmādhutvamanvākhyāya punastairapyancākhyāpaka śabda sādhutva nirṇayātparihariṣyate /	But this interdepen dence can be explained away by bearing in mind the fact that, in the first place by an observation of ordinary usage people become cognisant of the fact of certain words denoting certain meanings, though they may not have yet quite ascertained the true expressiveness of the words and it is these words that go to compose the rules of Grammar, which help to establish the correctness of certain other words and then these latter are made the means of finally establishing the correctness and the true expressive ness of the former words composing the rules.
yadi vācakataivādau na syāya karaṇādṛte /	There could be an irremediable interdependence, only if, without the help of Grammar the words were not expressive, or if their expressiveness were not cognised.

And thus we find that while Grammar helps us to realise the expressiveness of the correct words only, ordinary usage is the means of ascertaining that of these as well as their corruptions and as such the two being found to be treating of two distinct subjects, the Science of Grammar cannot be said to be a needless repetition.
yathaiva laukikapratipadapāṭhasthāśakyatvamevaṃ vede 'pi sarvaśākhāgatānmakṛdapi śrotumaśaktiḥ kimutādhdhetum	In the Veda, as also in ordinary usage, we find only a few of the cor rect words and even as regards these who could ever get at any idea of all the words contained in the endless branches of the Veda, and used in ordinary parla That is to say, just as it is absolutely impossible for us to get up all the individual words used in ordinary parlance, so too is it impossible even to hear all the words contained in the various branches of the Veda,to say nothing of getting these up.

Thus then we find that, though there are grammatical explanations of the words contained in the Injunctive sentences that point out the fact of the use and knowledge of correct words bringing about certain transcenden tal results, both in connection with sacrifices and with the human agent, yet this cannot be said to involve an inadmissible interdependence, on the ground of the grammatical rules themselves being based upon a previous conception of the meanings of those words.
yadi hokāntena "tasmānna brāhmaṇena mlechitavai,” “ekaḥ śabdaḥ samyagjñātaḥ suprayuktaḥ śāstrānvitaḥ kharge loka kāmadhugbhavati” / “tasmādeṣā vyākṛtā vāgudyata" iti caivamādikratupuruṣagata niyama vidhidarśanottarakālameva vyākaraṇena pravarttitavyamiti paurvāparyavyavasthā bhavet, tata evaṃ paryyanuyogaḥ prasajyetāpi /	Because if it were a recognised necessity that the Science of Grammar must always operate, after one has come across certain restrictive Injunctions with reference to sacrifices and human agentsas for instance, the Brāhmana should not pronounce an incorrect word at a sacrifice, a single word duly learnt and rightly used brings about all desirable results both here and here after, hence a grammatically correct speech rises, and so forth, then alone could our assertion be open to the charge of interdependence for in that case alone could the Vedic Injunction be dependent upon the words explained grammatically, and Grammar itself would be dependent upon the said Injunctions.

And hence we find no discrepancy in the Rules dealing with the use of words, which have always eternally been found capable.

saṃmugdhavācaka loke lakṣaṇāḍācakaḥ sphuṭaḥ /	It is conjointly by means of Grammar and ordinary usage that the true expressive word is ascertained and hence ordinary usage by itself is accepted as the means of knowing the expressiveness of words only so long as it is not found to be amenable to a certain grammatical rule.

That is to say, just as in the case of certain men, resembling one another in bodily form, ordinary perception can only afford a confused idea of their respective castes and it is only by means of the remembrance of their parents that the castes can be rightly ascertained so also in the case in question, ordinary usage being found to point promiscuously to the expres sive character of all sorts of words correct and incorrect, it is only by means of the remembrance smrti of grammatical rules that we can rightly discriminate the correct word and in this there is no contradiction of ordinary experience.
sādhvasādhuvibhāgoyaṃ kuśalairvarṇabhedavat	And, exactly like the differentia tion of castes, the distinction of correct and incorrect words, being at first established by the smrti, subsequently comes to be a matter of ordinary perception, for all clever people.
tasmai tarkeṇa yo nāma sādhayecchabda saṃkaram /	There are certain facts pointed out by the smrtisuch as the fact of a certain result proceeding from a certain actionthe time of whose appear ance is not fixed and hence not knowing when they could be actually realised, these cannot be said to be amenable to direct senseperception and as such we cannot but base these upon the sole authority of the Scrip tures smrti.

And if to such a person, one were to say that all words are equally expressive and correct he would be making an assertion that would be set aside by a fact of Senseperception, exactly as if one were to assert that all men are of the same caste or that all musical tones are alike.

etau dvāvapyathā na śāstrāite 'nyena pratipādayituṃ śakye te ityatīva śāstraviṣayaḥ /	These two subjectssinfulness and virtuousnessare not amenable to any other means of right notion but the Verbal Autho rity of the scriptures.

Nor is there any such law as that the scriptures should always treat of Injunctions and Prohibitions only, and never of the existing state of things because we meet with many such declarations as this self is imperishable, &c., &c.which describe the existing state of things with out any tinge of Injunction or Prohibition and yet they are not found to be incapable of expressing the true state of things.
nāpi tatpratipādane śāstraśabdavācyatvaṃ bādhaḥ /	Nor do they cease to be scriptures by the mere description of such things.
evaṃ vyākaraṇānugatavaidikaśabdāvināśasāhagyādapi taḍidhalaukikā vinaṣṭatvopamānaṃ darśayitavyam / tathā laukikārthapratyayotyāpitavācakatvārthāpattilabhyastāvadekaḥ sādhutvaniścayaḥ /	But even if there be such a rule as that scriptures must consist only of Injunctions and Prohi bitions, then too, we could have such an Injunction as that one should make use of such and such correct words, or that if one desiring to ob tain the results mentioned in other scriptural passages should wish to make use of uncorrupted forms of words, he should always employ such. and such words, with such and such vowels and consonants, neither more nor less than what is absolutely correct and as it is possible to have such Injunctions and Prohibitions, the correctness of words can very well be re garded as amenable to the verbal authority of the scriptures. Even from the Analogy of such instances as the experienced man pronouncing the correct word Devadatta and the child pronouncing the same word as Tatta, we can deduce the fact that words can have both correct and incorrect forms.
tataḥ saṃbhavatpramādālasya kara pāvaiguṇyanimittāpabhraṣṭarūpavarjita kevala sādhvanyākhyānasya / anyathānupapadyamānatvādaparayāpyarthāpattyā siddhameva sādhutvajñānam	And so also on finding certain uncorrupt Vedic words to be in keeping with the rules of Grammar, we deduce from Analogy the correctness of similar uncorrupted forms of words that occur in ordinary parlance. So too, the correctness of a word is cognisable, in the first instance, by means of the Apparent Inconsistency of the expressiveness of the word as found to be denoting a certain meaning in ordinary parlance and secondly, the correctness could also be ascertained by another Apparent In consistencynamely that of the word being entirely free from all corrup tions due to such causes as carelessness, idleness, a disorder in the organs of speech and the like.
yadyapyanabhiyuktānāṃ prayogo 'sti sasaṃkaraḥ /	The corrupt forms of words are said to be correct, on the ground of their similarity with the correct words but we ascertain the negation of such correctness, from the mere absence or Negation of the condi tions of correctness laid down in grammatical rules.
abhiyuktā vivekṣyante tathāpi brāhmaṇādivat	Thus then, the correctness and the incorrectness of words being found to be amenable to all the six means of right notion, who would be bold enough to assert that none of them is applicable to the case and that as such there can be no means of ascertaining the correctness of words? Though we find ignorant people making use of both correct and incor rect forms of words, yet the learned would be always ready to discrimi nate between the two, just as they always distinguish the Brāhmaṇa from the non nBrāhmana.
yathā ratnaparīkṣāyāṃ sādhvasādhutvalakṣaṇam / tathā vyākaraṇātmiddhaṃ sādhuśabda nirūpaṇam	For just as those that are expert in the matter of jewelry, &c., can easily differentiate the real gem from the pieces of glass and other things that may be mixed up with it, so would the learned dis tinguish the correct from the incorrect forms of words. And just as for the testing of gems we have certain directions for knowing the real from the unreal so too, for the knowing of the correct from the incorrect word, we have the rules laid down in the works on Grammar.
niyamaḥ parisaṃkhyā vā na vyāvarttyādi neṣyate / nityatāmātrakārī tu niyamaḥ kiṃ na labhyate	It has been argued above that the using of correct words being found to serve a visible purpose, such usage would come about always by its very nature and as such there can be no need of any Injunction with regard to it as it is an admitted fact that an Injunction has its use only in laying down something not otherwise cognisable.
atra śreyo'rthino 'vaśyaṃ sādhubhāṣā niyamyate /	But we shall reply to this under the sutraThe Injunction serves the pur pose of restricting the usage to the correct words only IVii.
atha vā naivāpaśabdānāmapṛthakke cidekakriyāviṣayānekadravyaguṇādivadabhidhāyāṃ prāpnuvanti ye sādhuniyamena vyāvartheran / kiṃ tu	Or, the incorrect words being nothing totally distinct from the correct ones, of which alone they are the corrupted forms, the possibility of the employment of these cannot be of the same alternative kind as that of various materials, &c., in the performance of a single action and as such, words cannot be the fit objects for being set aside by the said Restric tive Injunction. But the real fact is that while the person is actually thinking of using the correct word, he may, through carelessness, come to corrupt it in pronouncing it wrongly and what the said Injunction does is to lay down that one should never distort or corrupt the words he uses.
tadyathā / yo vidagdhaḥ ma naiṝta ityevamādidoṣa nindāpūrvakasavitāpayitavya iti niyamyate /	And there are many examples of such Restrictive Injunctions for instance, the passage, that cake which is burnt becomes fit for the Rakshasa, which in deprecating the burnt cake, points to the Injunction that one should so cook the cake as not to overburn it.
tathā duṣṭaḥ śabdaḥ kharato varṇato vetyādinā ninditatvāt / tasmādbrāhmaṇena na mlecchita vai nāpabhāṣitavai mleko ha vā eṣa yadapaśabda iti pramādādinimitavināśena śabdakāryādarthasādhanādapeto 'yaṃ mlecchaḥ, mleccha travyaktāyāṃ vācīti smaraṇāt sa na prayoktavya iti pratiṣedhastaramā deṣā vyākṛtā vāgudyate iti ca vidhiravinaṣṭaprayoganiyamārthaḥ	So too, we have a deprecation of the use of incorrect words in the sentencea word used incorrectly either as to accent kills the person and we have a prohibition of such use in the sentence The Brahmana should not behave like a Mleccha in utter ing incorrect words, because an incorrect word is a Mleccha where the word Mleccha indicating a confused sound or speech serves to point to the fact of an incorrect word being a corruption due to carelessness, and as such incapable of rightly fulfilling the duty of the word in the shape of expressing the meaning and both these deprecation and prohibition go to show that the Injunction hence it is a duly purified speech that goes forth,serves to limit all rightful usage to the uncorrupted forms of words. An objection is here raised Such discrepancies in the pronunciation, &c. of words as are due to an inherent incapacity in the speaker, or to carelessness inevitable under certain circumstances can never be avoided and as such these can never be rightly made the objects of prohibition. To this we make the following reply The sense of the prohibition, is that one should not be careless in the use of words, and that he should try his best to obtain mastery over them otherwise no regard could be shown to that prohibition.
a śaktāvāpramattāśca vaḍheyuranivāritāḥ	in forms that would be easy of pronunciation, would purposely distort the real forms of words, even though they were quite capable of pronoun cing the correct word though not with the same ease.
anye 'pi prākṛtānjāpera bhaktairvyavahartṛbhiḥ /	And if a certain person incapable of pronouncing the real form would pronounce the corrupt one, other people, though knowing it to be the corrupt form, would yet, in flattering imitation of the former person, persist in pronouncing it in the same form if such pronunciation were not distinctly forbidden.
saha vyavacarantastānupetyāpi prayuñjate	And it often happens that when conversing with persons, knowing only the corrupt form of a language, and quite incapable of using the correct one, even capable persons make use of the same corrupt forms.
dṛṣṭārthapratyāyananirākāṅkṣatvādadṛṣṭārthaprayogotpattyaśāstra yattu tvamiti /	And thus there being many causes leading to the use of corrupt forms of words, it is only right that we should have a Restrictive Injunction that should make us avoid such corrupt usage and take to the correct one. Another argument of the Purvapaksha is that, inasmuch as we find words fulfilling the visible purpose of the denoting of a certain mean ing, Grammar cannot be held to be a scripture dealing with such usages as would lead to a transcendental result.
ekasya bhayatve saṃyogapṛthakkaṃ kāraṇaṃ tacceca prakaraṇānārabhyavādābhyāmavagataṃ, tatra	It is only such conjunction and disjunction that make the same result to be both and this, in the present instance, is ascertained in the following manner the result that is mentioned in a sacrificial context is accepted as belonging to the sacrifice while that which is described apart from any sacrifices, is held to belong to the Agent.
ṛtvarthaṃ hyanirjātopāyatvātsarvā dṛṣṭopasaṃgrahakṣamamiti niyamāpūrvamātmasātkurvatpuruṣārthī śe phalaśrutimarthavādī karoti /	That is to say, the Apurva bearing upon the sacrifice, not having the means of its accomplishment fully known, is capable of containing within itself all the transcendental results in connection with it and as such it withdraws within itself the Apurva following from the Restriction of usage to correct words, and then relegates the mention of the accruing of certain results to the human Agent to the realms of Arthavada.
puruṣārthasya niyamasya tvavaṇya kalpanīya prayojanatvādarśapratipattesvāpabhraṃśepyatinikocādibhyo vā sutarāṃ siddhatvāt / anākāṅgitaniyamāpūrvopajovanasāmarthyaṃ nāstītyavaṇyamarthavādopāttameva svargaloke kāmadhugādyeva phalatvenāśrayaṇīyam / yattu na jñāyate vedaṃ niyamāpūrvamāśritamiti, tatrābhidhīyate	Whereas in the case of the Restriction being for the sake of the Agent, it becomes absolutely necessary to assume a purpose for such Restriction and as for the comprehension of meaning, this is often found to be obtained even by means of the corruptions of words as also through certain silent gestures and hence the Restriction by itself, having all its wants fulfilled as shown above, is not capable of setting up the Apurva or transcendental result and as such it becomes absolutely neces sary to accept as the true result of following the Restriction, the attain ment of all desirable things both here and in heaven, which is mentioned in the corresponding Arthavada passage. Another question put by the Purvapaksha isWhere does this transcendental result of the Restriction reside ? And to this we make the following reply That result which has its end in the sacrifice itself resides in the subsidiaries that go to make up the sacrifice, while that which is is not m mentioned with reference to any subsidiary character, resides in the person that performs the sacrifice.
prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	And in the case of the passage one word correctly pro nounced, &c.
prakaraṇa viśeṣādā tadyuktasya tatsaṃskāro dravyavaditi hi jyotiṣṭomaprakaraṇagata brāhmaṇa śabdanna citatadapūrva sādhanayajamānasaṃskāratvātmādhubhāṣaṇa niyamāpūrvasya / yājamānāstu tatpradhānatvātkarmavadityanena nyāyena phalapratigrahaṇayogyatvādhānārthaṃ ta dāśritameva vijñāyate /	which refers to the Person only, the result following from such correct use, is held to reside in the person knowing and using the correct word, exactly as the result of the main sacrifice is found to reside in the Person because the mention of correct speaking and correct knowing directly point to such a speaker and knower, who is also aniver sally recognised as the main receptacle of the results following from these actions of speaking and knowing. mana the Instrumental ending in the word brāhmaṇēna, by the Brāli mana, indicates the secondary character of the speaker and as such he may not be accepted as the receptacle of the main result, yet, inasmuch as it is the speaker that is affected by the purification due to the correct use of words, the primary position may be assigned to him exactly as in the case of the Remnant of the Prayaja butter. That is to say, in the case of the passage Mixes the sacrificial material with the remnant of the Prayuja, though the word remnant has the Instrumental ending, yet inasmuch as it has to serve a useful purpose, it is accepted to be the chief object of the purification exactly the same is the case with the word Brahmana in the passage in question. Or it may be that, the Instrumental ending in the word by the Brāh mana points to the performer of the sacrifice and his primary character is got at from without, through the mention of the word kama dhuk obtaining of all desirable results, which appears in another passage.
puruṣārthavākye 'pi samyagjñātanuprayuktatvācitajñātṛprayoktṛparyyapasthāpanātkriyāphalayośca tadgāmitvāpradhānayāgādyapūrvavadeva jñātṛprayokkāśritaṃ niṣpadyate yathaiva prayājaśeṣeṇa havaṣyabhighārayatīti satyapi śeṣasya tīyānirdeśa kāryopayogitvātsaṃskāryatvāvadhāraṇameva brāhmaṇasyāpotyadoṣaḥ	And it is a wellknown fact that that which has a secondary position in the sacrifice, attains the pri mary position, in reference to the purification as following from the sacri fice and in the case in question the using of correct words does not affect the sacrifice indirectly through an Apurva, but directly by impart ing a certain purity to the Person performing the sacrifice. And the fact of the sacrifice being thus affected is indicated by the context, as also by the Instrumental ending in the word Brāhmaṇēna and it is this very fact that enables us to accept the purification, &c., as subsidiary to the Person, who thus comes to be recognised to have the primary position. Even when the said Restrictive Injunction refers to a Person, apart from any sacrifices, the word kāmadhuk expressing the fulfilment of the desirable and useful purpose of Man,it distinctly indicates the primary position of the Person. Though, as matter of fact, the utterance of a correct word is not for the sake of the speaker or the sacrificer but for that of one to whom it is addressed, yet it is the Restriction and Prohibition referring to such use that can be accepted as being for the sake of the speaker and the sacrifice.
na hyārādupakāritvaṃ saṃyuktasyopayogitā	For certainly, it is not necessary that the Restriction and Prohibition in connection with a certain action must be for the sake of the same person, for whose sake the action itself is performed.
stryupāyamāṃsabhakṣā dipuruṣārthamapi śritaḥ /	For instance, though such actions as intercourse with women and eating of meat are found to be performed for the sake of the person, yet the prohibition of these acts is accepted, through the peculiarities of the context, as referring to the EN wer sacrifice.
pratiṣedhaḥ kratoraṅgamiṣṭaḥ prakaraṇāśrayāt parārthoccāraṇāśritāvapi niyamapratiṣedhau svaprayojanākāṅkṣāvenāyāṃ sannihitapuruṣapradhānau vijñāyate yaccāsya kṛtrimatvena svataḥ śāstratvabādhanam /	And again, though the sacrificial post made of the khadira wood is apparently found to serve a useful purpose in the performance of the sacrifice, yet from the peculiarity of the passage limiting the material of the post to the one particular kind of wood, we come to recognise it as imparting strength to the person performing the sacrifice. And so also through the feeding of the guest, when the action of eating belongs to the guest, the peculiar transcendental result following from it is found to accrue to the person feeding him. In the same manner, even though the word is uttered for the sake of another person, yet the Restriction and Prohibition pertaining to it, when seeking for a receptacle of their result, distinctly point to the person speaking, as he is found to be in closest touch with the word.
tatprasiddhiviruddhaṃ syādacandra śaśivākyavat	Thus then, the fact of the Science of Grammar being based upon the Veda having been fully established, it is extremely unfair to deny the fact of its being a scripture dealing with the usage of words. on The character of Scripture has been denied to the Science of Grammar, the ground of its having been propounded by human authors but this is as much against a universally acknowledged fact as to assert that the Moon is not the moon. That is to say, if the word Castra Scripture t is to be taken in its ordinary conventional signification, then it must in clude all the fourteen sciences and as Grammar is included among these, the character of Castra cannot be rightly denied to it.
prasiddhamapi śākhatvaṃ yastu tarkeṇa vārayet /	If, however, the word Castra be taken in its literal sense that which teaches, then, as we actually find Grammar teaching us the correct forms of words, or the Roots and Affixes as making up these words, and also teaching the students.
vedasyāpi na nityatvāyomavadvārayiṣyati	all these words, &c., the application of the word Çastra to it cannot in any case be doubted.

In the same manner, one who is found to be making incoherent assertions with regard to subjects apart from the Veda, is checked by the Veda itself but when he proceeds to deprive the Veda itself of one of its essential parts the Grammar, by what could he be checked? And when a person becoming angry with another cuts off his limbs, one whose limbs are thus cut off lives only for a very short time.
śrutismṛtipramāṇatve hetupūrvaṃ nirūpite /	Hence it is only when one wishes to destroy the Veda, that he begins by striking at its parts the subsidiary sciences and then continuing in the same path, he cuts off the main source itself.
aṅgānāmapramāṇatvamaśākhatvaṃ ca ko vadet athāpi smṛtiśabdena nāṅgānāmabhidheyatā /	But as a matter of fact we have found that the authoritative character of the Veda and the Smrtis has been firmly established by means of vari ous reasonings detailed above,how then could any one dare to deny the authority and the scriptural character of the subsidiary sciences parts of the Veda ? It has been urged by the Purvapaksha that all the Smrtis are found to resemble one another while that of Grammar is entirely different from all of them and as such Grammar cannot be accepted to be one of the Smrtis.
tathāpyeṣāṃ na śāstratvapramāṇatva nirākriyā iti hi tunnyavatprāmāṇyasmaraṇam	Even though the subsidiary sciences were not called Smrtis, yet we could not deny the fact of their being so many scriptures and having a decidedly authoritative character because Manu has declared an equal authority to belong to the following the Puranas, the Science of Duty as laid down by Manu, the Veda with all its Subsidiaries, and the Science of Medicine.
pramāṇaṣaṭakamūlatvaṃ pūrva caiṣāṃ pradarśitam / dṛṣṭādṛṣṭaphalatvena tasmāntrākhya pramāṇatā	In regard to Smrtis, we have shown above, under Sutra Iiii, that they must be admitted to be authoritative, because their authors are the very same persons who are found to perform the sacrifices laid down in the Veda and this reasoning is equally applicable to the Subsidiary Sciences of the Veda. And we have just shown above, that as bringing about visible as well as transcendental results, the authority of the Subsidiary Sciences of the Veda is cognisable by all the six means of right notion and as such their authority can never be denied.
asaṃbhāvitamūlaṃ hi pauruṣeyaṃ yaducyate /	And in regard to that work of the human author of which a basis is not found, if it be asserted that it has no basis at all, such an assertion would be as acceptable as the description of a colour by one who is born blind.
mūle tasyāpratiṣṭhatvaṃ rūpe jātyandhavākyavat smṛtīnāmapramāṇatve vigānaṃ naiva kāraṇam /	Because it is only when the character of the Smrti is in exact keeping with that of its basic Vedic text, and not otherwise, that it can be accepted as authoritative. And hence the presence of contradictions in the Smrtis cannot be held to affect their authority specially as when ever there are two contradictory texts, they can both be accepted as option al alternatives and none of them can be said to be absolutely false or unauthoritative.
mūlānurūpyeṇa hi smṛtīnāṃ pramāṇatvaṃ tadavigānena dharmasādhanatāṃśe ca vigānaṃ naiva vidyate /	But as a matter of fact there is no contradiction among the Smrtis on the subject of Dharma that is to say, all of them agree on the point of the use of correct words accomplishing a Dharma and as all the contradictions that we perceive is in the matter of details, the presence of these cannot be considered a fault, as they treat of entirely different subjects.
anvākhyānavigānaṃ tu lakṣyabhedānna duṣyati yattu vā pramāṇatvamiti /	And as for these attacks themselves, they cannot be accepted as contrary authorities, because they have no basis in the Veda, and as such cannot be accepted as affecting the authority of the Sutras which are based upon the Veda.
ye cāpīṣṭyupasaṃkhyāne te ca smṛtyantarāśrite	are all based upon other grammatical Smrtis and certainly the addition of more matter does not shake the authority of the briefer work.
vājasaneyiśākhāyāmādhvaryavaṃ carakaśākhāsu ca bahityetāvatā nālpaviṣayamapramāṇīkurvanti /	For in stance, though the statement of the duties of the Adhvaryu priest is very brief in the Vajasaneyi Sanhita, and that in the Caraka Sanhita is much more detailed, yet this fact does not shake the authority of the former brief statement.
tasmādayamapina doṣaḥ /	Hence the presence of such additions cannot be taken as faulty.
yastu sūtrakārasya prayojanānabhidhānopālambhaḥ satyavacanaṃ ca sarvaśrutismṛtiṣu svargasādhanatvena yāgasādhanatvena ca niyatam /	As for the reproach that the author of the grammatical Sūtras has not mentioned the purpose or motive of his work such an omission does not merit a reproach because the purpose of grammar is fully known from all Vedas and Smrtis and at the close of the grammatical work itself, its purpose becomes selfevident. And again, it is a fact univer sally known that the telling of truth leads one to Heaven, and helps to accomplish the sacrifices.
satyaṃ ca dvividhaṃ śabdasatyamarthasatyaṃ ca /	And we all know that truth is of two kinds the truth of matter, and the truth of words.

And we have already shown that a knowledge of the true or correct word is obtained from a careful study of grammar which is thus found to be indirectly serving the purposes of leading the man to Heaven and accomplishing the various sacrifices. And thus, the author of the Sutra did not mention the purpose of his work, simply because it was found to be too wellknown to need such mentionthis purpose being the explanation of all words.
na ca vyākaraṇaprayojanābhiprāyaṃ prati ke cihnivadante sa eva tvabhiprāyaḥ kiṃ nyāyyo netyarthāntarametat	Nor is there any difference of opinion on the point of the purpose of Grammar. And as to whether this pur pose is rightful or not upon which there is a diversity of opinion, it is a different matter altogether.

That is to say, Grammar serves the purpose of laying down two restrictions that one should use only the correct forms of wordsthe knowledge and the using of such words leading the person to Heaven and helping accomplish the sacrifices and this is known from the Veda itself and as such, not depending upon any other authority, this restriction must be accepted as laid down by the Veda itself that such and such words are correct which is pointed out by Grammar alone as without Grammar, the correct words could not be rightly distinguished from the incorrect ones.
sarvatraiva hi vijñānaṃ saṃskāratvena gamyate /	In all cases knowledge is always found to be a means of purifying, and as such auxiliary to something else with the sole exception of the knowledge of Self.
parāṅgaṃ cātmavijñānādanyatretyavadhāraṇāt	And then again, such passages as the Self free from all evil...is to be sought after, &c., one should worship the Self lay down the knowledge of Self as accomplished by a process accom panied by due reflection, &c and then from such knowledge, we find that there accrues to the agents both kinds of resultHappiness as well as final Deliverance, as is shown by the following passages He obtains all worlds and all desires, passes beyond all sorrow, &c., &c.,which speaks of all the eight perfections of Yoga accrning to the person know ing the self and the passage passing his life thus he, after death, reaches the regions of Brahma, and from there he never returns which points to the attainment of the Supreme Self Final Deliverance also as following from a due knowledge of the Self.
na ca jñānavidhānena karmmasaṃbandhavāraṇam /	Nor can it be rightly urged that, because the, Self is laid down as the object of knowledge, it cannot have any connection with actions.

And inasmuch as these duties on the one hand, and the knowledge of Self on the other, have distinct purposes to fulfil, and proceed on two entirely different lines, they cannot be said either to reject each other, or to be accepted as optional alternatives, or to form parts of one another.
śabdajñānasya tvekāntena prayogāṅgatvātpūrvatarabhāvitvāñca na pṛthak phalasaṃbandha saṃbhava iti jñānapūrvaprayogaphalavattvameva niścīyate / yattvādimayākaraṇajñānatatpūrvakaprayogaphalasaṃbandho'nādividhimūlo nāvakalpataiti tana yūpādikaraṇavayākaraṇaparaṃparānāditvādanupālambhaḥ /	The knowledge of words, on the other hand, is always auxiliary to its usage, and always precedes it and as such it cannot have any result apart from that which follows from such usage and hence we conclude that the said results follow only from the using of the properly discriminated correct forms of words. Another objection urged in the Purvapaksha is that, the correct use of words following upon a knowledge of Grammar having a beginning in time, the mention of any results following from it, can never form the object of an eternal Vedic Injunction. But the continuity of Grammar is as eternal as that of the making of the sacrificial post, &c., and though, as in the case of the post, the individual use of a correct word may have a beginning in time, yet such usage has ever continued from time immemorial and as such the objection does not affect the question.
tasmādeṣā vyākṛteti ca vyākaraṇavyavahāra nityatvamuktam	And the eternality of Grammar is also pointed out by the Vedic passage the speech grammatically purified is used.
yadapi ca manunā paṅktipāvanamadhye vedādevopalabhyoktam / “yaśca vyākurute vācaṃ yaśca mīmāṃsatedhvara” miti tenāpi pūrvapaścāduktāṣītavedatvayajñamīmāṃsanavyatiriktaviṣayeṇa satāvaṇyametadeva vyākaraṇajñānamāśrayitavyamiti tannityatvasiddhiḥ	Because in that case the addition of the word used would be a useless repetition. We find Manu also declaring, while enumerating the holiest of Brāhmaṇas One who grammatically explains a sentence, and he who investigates the nature of sacrifices, &c., and this distinctly shows that he who explains grammatically is something different from the person who has studied the Veda and also from one who investigates the nature of sacrifices and as such the said passage cannot but be taken as pointing to a knowledge of Grammar as an independent condition of holiness and this distinctly shows that Grammar is eternal.

From among the four kinds of wordsNouns, Verbs, Prefixes and Nipātas, we take the case of the Nouns and from among Nouns, signi fying the Class, Property, Action, Substance, Names and Pronouns, we take into consideration only those that denote the Olass and from these again, we single out the word Cow as a typical instance, And with regard to this we proceed to consider whether the word denotes the Class or the Individual. But leaving this point aside for a time, to be taken up later, we proceed, with a view to ascertain the character of the means word and consequences signification of Vedic Injunctions, to consider the ques tion as to whether the words used in the Veda, and the meanings signified by them, are the same as those in ordinary parlance, or different? An objection is here raised What would be the use of proving that the words used in the Veda are the same as those in ordinary parlance, that this should be taken up first of all? To this we make the following reply The use of this discussion will be found to appertain to the Vedic words while the means of such discussion and ascertainment is found in the ordinary parlance of the people of the present day and as such it becomes necessary to prove the two to be the same. That is to say, if the words used in the Veda and the sense in which they are there used, be the same as those in ordinary parlance, then alone could it be possible for us to ascertain whether any particular object is denotable by a certain Vedic word or not and this can be done only Individual in accordance with the various usages current among the experienced men of the present day.
tadvaśātkriyamāṇe tu na cintye śrutilakṣaṇe /	While any ascertainment, as to whether a word really denotes the Class or the Individual, would not serve any useful purpose in ordinary parlance.
tena śabdārthabhinnatve vyaktyākṛtivicāraṇā /	Because in ordinary parlance, a word being used with reference to varions intermixed significations, brings about the idea of only some of these significations and thus the purpose of the speaker having been duly fulfilled even by the signification.

And then, inasmuch as it is only the ordinary language that is found to be of use in daily life, while that of the Veda is absolutely useless, we cannot admit Dharma to be that which is pointed out by the Veda. S That is to say, the word in the Veda is held to be different from that in ordinary parlance, because the latter is not affected by the peculiarities.

That is to say, if there be a difference, the words in the Veda would be entirely strange to an ordinary person and as such any Vedic sentence would be absolutely meaningless to him and there would be a complete absence of all such Injunctions as tend to prompt people to the performance of certain actions.

The sutra speaks of the identity of the objects expressed arthaikatva though that of words is also meant, because the object is the more important factor of the two or the word artha may be taken in the sense of thing, and this would apply to the word as well as to the object spoken of. is both of the words and the objects spoken of, yet the sutra men tions the word artha alone because this would naturally imply that of the word also or the word artha may be taken as signifying things in general aud this would include both the words and the ob jects spoken of.

taducyate /	And to this we offer the following reply Because of nondifferentia tion.
pratyabhijñārūpapratyayavibhāgād jñāyamānobhayaprameyarūpāvibhāgāḍhā vākyatatmamūhamācanibandhanāpannapadavarṇaviṣayatvavyapadeśāvibhāgādvā tathoccārayitṝṇāṃ sthānakaraṇaprayatnāvibhāgādā lakṣaṇavidāṃ vā bahutarānugamanāvibhāgāditi hetvarthavikalpāḥ	That is to say, in proof of the said identity, we have the following nondifferentiations The word go found in the Veda is recognised as nondifferent from that met with in ordinary usage the object ex pressed by the word go as used in the Veda is found to be nondifferent from that expressed by it in ordinary usage all the difference that we do perceive is only in regard to sentences, and none with regard to words and letters the pronunciation and the degrees of effort em ployed in the utterance of Vedic words are perceived to be nondifferent from those in that of words in ordinary parlance and the rules laid down by grammarians are not found to be different in the case of Vedic words and in that of the words in ordinary usage. That is to say, inasmuch as we actually recognise the words used in the Veda to be the same as those used in ordinary parlance, we cannot but accept them to be identical. And it follows from this that the objects spoken of also being expressed by the same words must be accepted to be the same in both cases.
yathāśrutavādīnāṃ yāpi vāccāntare śrutiḥ / arthaikatvāvirodhena guṇamātrānyatā parā	wellrecognised word is found to point to something altogether strange i.e., walking on the back, which we do not per ceive in the ordinary cow yet even in this case, there being nothing in congruous in taking the word cow to mean the same thing that it does in ordinary parlauce, the word expressing the strange thing may be ex plained as simply showing a difference in the quality of the object denoted.
evaṃ satyeva gotvāḍhau dharmo yadi vilakṣaṇaḥ / naitāvatārthabhedo'sti viśeṣānabhidhānataḥ	Exactly in the same manner, the denotation of the cow being the same in both cases, if there be a difference in the qualifications described, this cannot make any difference in the object itself specially as the word cow does not denote any individual cow whose character could be affected by qualifications.
evaṃ hiraṇyapaṇaṃtvaṃ merau yadi vanaspateḥ devaloke tataḥ śabdaḥ kimarthāntaravāccayam na ca sarvā prasiddhatve gamyetaiko 'pi kañcana / tenāsiddhairasidvānāṃ nāstyanyatvanirūpaṇam	In the same manner, though the trees on the Meru Mountain the residence of the gods have their leaves of gold, yet the word tree cannot be said to signify, in the region of the gods, anything other than the ordinary tree. So too, though what is butter for us be honey for the gods, yet the meaning of the words do not become different, specially as what we know as butter is what is transformed, by certain modifications of taste and potencies, into the honey of the gods. And as a matter of fact all Vedic words being equally strange to the ordinary man according to theory of the lurvapaksha, not a single word of the said passage could be compreliended and as such the expression walking on the back being itself uncomprehended, it could not point to the cow spoken of in the passage as being on account of such walking something other than the ordinary cow.
dvau ca paścāvupanyastau bhāṣyakāreṇa yadyapi / vyākhyātārastathāpyatra kuryuḥ pakṣāntararāṣyapi ete pakṣāḥ punaryojyā vyatikīrṇāḥ parasparam /	Or, the passage may refer to the fact that it is the ordinary cows of the Earth that are referred to in the passage, as appearing to walk on their backs, owing to the revolutions of the Earth together with all the three worlds, as described in the Puranas. That is to say, just as we see the gods above us, so too, when in the course of revolution the Earth reaches a point above the abode of the gods, they see the things on the Earth as above them and hence it is only natural that to them the cows walking on the Earth should appear to be walking on their backs.
tathaitadviśiṣṭā kimākṛtirevātha vyaktireva, atha vikalpite kiṃ samuccite kimiti /	Hence we conclude that the words used in the Veda, as also the ob jects denoted by them, are the same as those in ordinary parlance.
evaṃ samudāyenāpi yojyam /	We now proceed to consider the question B.
tathā saṃbandha viśiṣṭa vyakti viśiṣṭā kṛtirevātha saṃbandhaviśiṣṭākṛtiviśiṣṭā vyaktirevātha vikalpo'tha samuccayaḥ / evaṃ samudāya viśiṣṭapakṣāḥ kalpayitavyāḥ /	collection, or that of the one qualified by the other. These alternatives again could be spun out into many others by mutual intermixture as also by being blended with notions of gender, case, number, &c., taken singly or all together and thereby the alternatives become innu merable. For instance, at first we have the following eight alternatives as to the denotation of a word Does it signify the Class only, or the Individual only, or either the Individual or the Class optionally, both the Class and the Individual, or the relationship of both, or the two taken together, or the Individual as qualified by the Class, or the Class as specified by the Individual.
tathā kiṃ jātyaiva viśiṣṭena saṃbandhena viśiṣṭā vyaktiḥ, atha vyaktyaiva viśiṣṭena saṃ prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Then again, does it signify the Relationship qualified by the Class alone, or by the Individual alone, or by the Individual or the Class optionally, or by both taken together, or by the Individual as specified by the Class, or by the Class as specified by the Individual, or by these as specified by one another, or by both ? Again, does the word signify the collection of both as qualified by the Class alone, &c., &c., as before? So also, does it signify the Relationship as qualified by the Class alone, &c., &c., &c.
evaṃ samuḍhāyenāpi viśiṣṭatā yojyā tathā kiṃ saṃbandhenaiva viśiṣṭayā jātyaiva viśiṣṭā vyaktirutaivavidhayā vyaktyaiva viśiṣṭā jātiratha vikalpo'tha samuccayaḥ	So again, is it the Class alone as qualified by the Individual specified by the Relationship, or is it the Individual as quali fied by the Class specified by the Class ? Or, is it the Individual and the Class one by one, or taken together? And we will have the same alter natives with regard to the Collation of the two. Again, is it the Indi vidual as qualified by the Relationship specified by the Class, or the Class as qualified by the Relationship specified by the Individual or these two taken either separately or together? So also by making the Relationship specified by the Collation of these two. Again, is it the Individual as qualified by the Class specified by the Relationship, or the Class as qualified by the Individual specified by the Rela tionship and so forth.
evaṃ śabdasvarūpasya punarjātyādibhiḥ saha /	Then again, we could have many alternatives as to the denotation of the word lying in the form of the word or in that of the Class, &c. and thus would have all the aforesaid alternatives.
eka dvitricatuṣpa caṣaṭkaiḥ saha vikalpanā	Among all these alternatives, that of the Class being the object of denotation is on one side, and all the others are on the other, all these latter being based upon the theory of the Individual being the object denoted by the word.
sarvatrendriyaliṅgābhyāṃ bhedaḥ stoko 'vagamyate /	And hence, when it has been proved that the Indi vidual is not denoted by the word, all the other alternatives become re jected by it and it is for this reason that the Bhashya has not spoken of these, apart from the Individualistic theory.
śabdena tu tumakṣmopi vastubhāgo vibhajyate atra cākṛtireveti dṛḍhaḥ pakṣoyamekataḥ / itare tvanyataḥ sarve vyaktipaścānuyāyinaḥ	And hence, though we have shown out all the alternatives in detail, yet it is with reference to the two Class and Individualonly that we proceed to consider which of them is directly denoted and which is indirectly implied. And in order to justify the very introduction of the discussion, the Bhashya proceeds to put a question and then explain what these the Class and the Individual really are. Objection The Akrti that you proceed to consider now has already been dealt with in the Tarkapäda See Çlokavārtika, Trans.
tataśca	pp.
nan prathamapādaevākṛternirūpaṇā didānoṃ praśnottare mandaprayojane	what then is the use of any question and answer with regard to the same thing ? Reply True it is that we have already described Akrti as being cognisable by senseperception. But we proceed to explain that what is meant by Akrti is, not the shape or form, but the Class.
dravyaguṇakarmaṇāṃ sāmānyamātramākṛtiriti	This is what the Bhashya means by declaring it to be the commonality of Substances, Properties and Actions. The classes of these substances too are relative in their extension, one being included in another and so on.
punarvāyutvateja stva jalatvātmatva bhinnatā / pṛthivītvāvaṭatvaṃ ca tadyaktiṣu samāpyate	A As for instance, the class C Thing is the highest that we can think of and in this are included, in the orde of lesser extension, the classes, Substance, Air, Fire, Water,Self. Under Substance again, we have in the same order, Earth, Jar, &c., ending with the individual jars. Under the class Tree, we have the classes Çinçapã and the rest under Body, we have Cow, Horse, Elephant, Man, &c.
paṃvā drāhmaṇa kauṇḍinya kaṭhatvādi samāpyate /	and then the classes Karka, &c., are ex pressive of the properties of horses as under Elephant, we have the various species Bhadra, Madra, &c. Under Man, we have ‘Bräh mana, Kaundinya, Katha, &c.
tathā guṇatvakarmatvarūpatā janmatādi yat prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	And just under the class Substance we have the above, so too under Property and Action, we have White, &c., and the individual actions of Sacrifice, Homa, and such other endless actions as are differentiated by means of various verbal roots, as also by distinct Injunctions, Numbers, and Names and Properties, &c.,as is held by other teachers of the Science.
punarvidhānasaṃkhyākhyā guṇaprakaraṇāntara anye tu bhedamācārthyāḥ karmaṇāmeva manvate / api vā vyatirekātsyādeśādarekarūpatā / rūpaśavdāvibhāgācca vacyatyetaddhi jaiminiḥ /	Or, all actions may be included in the one class of Action, the only difference consisting in the distinc tions of place, time, &c., as has been taught by Jaimini himself under the sutraRupaçabdāvibhāgāt. Thus then, it is proved that Akrti is Commonality, and not the shape of things specially as, if it meant the latter, how could it ever belong to such immaterial objects as the Self and the like? That is to say, such material objects as the jar and the like, may be found to have certain shapes, but in the case of such objects as Light, Water, Air and Akaçã, all the shape that is perceived is that which belongs to the Earthy element in them, and not to them by themselves. While in the case of such purely immaterial objects as the Self, Space, Time and Mind, as also in that of Action and Property, there can never be any shape at all.
evaṃ prapañcataṃ sarvamarthasāmānyamākṛtiḥ	Whereas Commonality or Class is found to apply to all things in the world. Hence we conclude that what is meant by the word Akrti in the present Adhi karana, is Class, and not any material form or shape.
atha saṃsthāna sāmānyamākṛtitvena gṛhyate / aśvādiṣvapi tulyatvādbhavedākṛtisaṃkaraḥ	Specially as the material shape of objects is destructible and varies in each individual, no such shape could ever be said to constitute the Commonality of objects. Even if the class shape itself be said to be meant by Akrti, then such a class being equally applicable to the cow and the horse, &c., there would be a hopeless overlapping of classes.
tasya chupalaśaṇamālocyamānaṃ na jāteranyajñabhyate taca jātireva sāmānyamiti nyāyenāpadyate /	Because in that case there would be no such subclass of shape as would form the denotation of the word cow and pervade over all individual cows, excluding all other animals, like the horse, &c. and when looking for such a differentiating factor, we cannot find any other except the Class and thus it becomes established that Class is the only commonality of objects.

mākṛtirevetyabhipretya mātraśabdaḥ prayuktaḥ /	is meant by the word Akrti this is indicated by the word matra in the Bhashya.
asādhāraṇa viśeṣā vyaktiriti / ke cidāḥ /	Says the Bhashya Asadharaṇaviçesha vyaktih. And some people ex plain this as defining the Individual to be the specific asādhāraṇāh pecu liarities viçëshāh.
asādhāraṇā viśeṣā eva vyaktiḥ /	But this is not correct because the Individual is something entirely different from the peculiarities.
viśeṣavyatiriktavyaktayabhāvāditi te cānyatrāpi dṛśyante tathā jātyantareṣvapi / śāvaleyādibhedosti tadapatyāntareṣvapi	Because what are held to be such pecu liarities are the khanda presence of defective limbs munda absence of horns and the like but these are found to exist in various individuals of the same class, and in those of other classes and so also are the peculiar ities of the grey colour and the like, which are found to apply to the progeny of a cow of the said colour. That is to say, the properties of the Khanda, &c., are found to exist in many individuals, of the same as well as different classes e.g., there are such cows, buffaloes and gavayas, aud &c.
piṇḍā sādhāraṇatvena tairvyaktirupalacyate “astyarthaḥ sarvabhavdānāmiti pratyāvyanacapaṇam /	And secondly, in this explanation of the Bhashya passage, the plural number in Viçesha would not be quite compatible with the singular in Vyaktih. For these reasons we must explain the Bhashya passage as defining the Individual to be that which possesses certain specific peculiarities of char acter.
tattu kacyāvibhāgena sāmānyānāṃ nirūpaṇāt / prayuktaṃ na gavādīnāṃ tatra vācakaśaktatā	Against this explanation of the compound as Bahuvrihi it may be urged that, as shown above the peculiarities khanda, &c., are found to be common to many individuals, and as for any such peculiarities as would belong to particular individuals only, no such are possible.
sattāmete vadantaśca na śuddhāṃ saviśeṣaṇām / vadantītya bhidhātuṃ hi śakyaṃ dvedhāpyasaṃbhavāt /	But to this, we make the following reply we do not mean that each Individual is to have any property peculiar to itself exclusively all that we mean is that certain characteristics, two or three together, are always recognised as being conjointly peculiar to a certain object, even when each of them singly may be found to belong to other objects as well.
śuddhavacanatve tāvat sarveṣāme kārya pratyāyanātparyāyatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	That is to say, even though certain properties may have been found to exist separately in many objects, yet taken together they are found only in a certain individual and such an Individual may be said to be specifically characterised by these peculiarities collectively.
deśakālādyapekṣāyāmapi naiva sattāyāṃ nāstitvamabhidhātuṃ yuktam / vibhutvanityatvābhyāṃ sarvadeśakālavyāpitvāt	And as a matter of fact we find that certain properties that have been perceived in a certain object are never found to exist, exactly in the same proportions, in any other object and the particular combination of properties that, never having been perceived elsewhere, is perceived in any object, comes to be recog nised as its specific peculiarity. And thus, though there be an endless number of individuals, yet that does not make it necessary to assume an endless number of specific characteristics.
jāyamānavipariṇāmādyavasthasarvatrastuṣu vinaśyattāparyanteṣu vastvākṛtipratipattirdṛśyate /	Thus then, the necessary specify ing peculiarity always being found, by only slight modifications, among a definite number of properties, all lesser less extensive classes also come to be recognised as individuals under the higher more extensive ones. And it is only the particular combinations of properties that come to be known by the name of Visçēha Specific Peculiarity.

The expressive potency of a word is always perceived, through Apparent Inconsistency, to be restrict ed to a certain definite object. And even such words as Substance, Property, and Action, which are expressive of classes immediately under the summum genus of Being, will be found to have their denota tions hopelessly mixed up, if they be all accepted as denoting the class Being only what then, would be the case with the words that are expressive of other minor classes ? And again, those who hold all words to signify Being, cannot define whether they denote pure Being by itself, or as qualified by some thing else because none of these two alternatives is admissible. a For if it be pure Being that is denoted by the word, then all the words in the world would be synonymous and any use of the verb is D would be an inadmissible repetition and any such assertion as the cow is not would be a hopeless selfcontradiction as it is absolutely impos sible ever to cognise that Being is not.
astitvamastitetyevaṃ dṛśyete pratyayau yataḥ /	Even with regard to special times and places, the existence of Being can never be denied because being eternal and allpervading, it must exist at all times and in all places.
sa vastuvacanaḥ śabda ākhyātapratirūpakaḥ astitīrā gauriti tiṅantasamāsatvenānupasaṃkhyānādavaprayaṃbhāvipratyayāntadāṇadvāra subantatvayogyāvyayapadena saha kṣīrāśabdasyānyapadārthe bahuvrīhirabhyupagantavyaḥ /	The word sattā Being is formed from the word Asti is as twice modified by means of two nominal affixes that which is sat, and the character of sat is satta and this is found to be applicable to all things at all periods of their existence, beginning from their production, and throughout all the various modifications that they undergo, to the point of time immediately preceding their destruction. And hence if this summum genus of Being were the denotation of all words, then it would have been more reasonable for the Vākyapadīya to assert things to be the denotation of all things, than existence or being? Nor have the words sat and sattā any other meaning than that which is signified by their root to be and hence they being exactly like the word bhavat the Present participle form of the root bhu to be, the word satta must mean sadbhāva, existence and it cannot be gratui tously assumed, according to the Vaiçeshikas, to signify a Class consisting of the idea that we have of the existence of Substance, Property and Action.
tatra cāyaṃ sadarthavacanaḥ sacīrā gauriti pratyayotpādāt /	Thus then, it has been shown that the word satta is formed out of the indeclinable form asti, which is synonymous with thing, and similar in character to the word bhavat.
tataśca vastuni sati ca prayuprathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	And it is because it is not a verb that we have such compounds astikshira in which the word asti an Indeclinable means exist ing.
taduktāntamananānādarācca padavākyavidbhirapyupekṣitaṃ prasiddhamivemāmavasthāṃ prāptaṃ yena gavādiśabdavāyatvenāpi saṃbhāvyate vastuśabdo hi rūḍhitvādyaktijātyantarāśritam / sāmānyaṃ yadravītyetadgamyaterthairgavādibhiḥ	The expressionastikshira gauh cannot be said to contain a verbal compound and hence we must accept the compound as Bahuvrihi, consisting of an Indeclinable asti which is capable of taking declen tional terminations, and the noun kshira, the meaning being that cow which has plenty of milk thus alone can the expression give as any sense. As a matter of fact, however, though the genus thing is indicated by all words, yet it cannot be said to form part of its denotation as for Being, however, it points to an entirely different property and as such how can it ever be accepted as forming the denotation of all words? In the case of the word thing, though the genus that it signifies inheres in an altogether different class and individual, yet it is indirectly indicated by such objects as the cow and the like.
yadevākṛtiviśiṣṭavyaktyabhidhānapate vyaktiviśiṣṭākṛtipakṣe vā nirākaraṇakāraṇaṃ tadatrāpi sulabham /	The denotation by all words of pure Being by itself having thus been found to be inadmissible, it becomes all the more unreasonable to assert the denotation of the word cow to consist in the genus Being as qualified by the cow i.e., the being of the cow. That is to say, this theory would be open to all the objections that we shall urge against the theory of the denotation of words consisting of the Individual as qualified by the Class, or of the Class as specified by the Individual.
viśeṣaṇasya pūrvaṃtarābhidhānaprasaṅgāt	Specially as the qualifying factor would always be cognised beforehand.

If the former, then, as in that case, the real denotation of the word Cow, as also Being having been accomplished in the qualifying adjunct Class cow itself which is always cognised beforehand, what would be the use of the denotation of Being after that? That is to say, without a previous expression of the qualifying adjunct, it is always impossible to have any notion of the qualified and then, the qualifying adjunct being closely related to the qualified, the previous cognition of the qualifying adjunct the class Cow could not but have indicated the genus Being also and as such we would not have any Apparent Inconsistency of the idea of Being entering into the conception of the class Cow that could justify us in assuming this notion of Being to form part of the direct denotation of the word Cow.
anityasaṃbandhajñānānantaśabdaśaktivyaktyabhidhānapūrvakaikasattā bhidhānakalpanāyāśca kevalavyaktyabhidhānapacavadanupapattiḥ /	If, however, the word Cow? be held to denote the genus Being as qualified by the individual cows, this too would be open to the same objections and there would be the further objection of such a theory necessitating the assumption of the denotation of endless Beings as preceded by that of an equally endless number of Individual cows by an endless number of words, by means of an endless potentiality of words bearing certain transitory relations with the said endless Individuals, &c and all this would make it as objec tionable as the theory that the word denotes the Individual.
yattu “apūrvadevatā svargaiḥ samamā” riti	It has been asserted in the above quotation from the Vakyapadiya, that the case of these words is said to be similar to those of the word Apurva Devata and Svarga.

Some of these words are recognised as signifying certain particular individuals, either through the Apparent Inconsistency of what is directly heard, or through supplementary explanations, or through other sentences and through this specific denotation of theirs, they also indicate, as the necessary concomitant of these, the genus Being which, thus, cannot be accepted as forming part of their direct denotation. Hence we conclude that, inasmuch as no object can avoid being concomitant with Being, the idea of this latter is due to an indirect indication by these words.

To explain further, all objects in the world are cognised, through Apparent Inconsistency, to have distinct potentialities of their own and hence we also admit of the existence of a potentiality, born of the performance of sacrifices, capable of bringing to the Agent a certaiu result at some future time and to this potency, we give the name of Apurva, so called because it had no existence prior to the performance of the sacrifice, from which it follows and thus the name applying to the potency in its very literal sense. who proceed to heaven, attain the regions of the star, and they couquer those bright regions of the pious.

Though any such pleasure has never been experienced in this world, yet we can form an idea of it by abstracting it from the mixed experiences that we have and thus the word Svarga directly denoting such pleasure, can only indirectly indicate the genus Being which canuot be admitted to form part of its direct denotation. Thus then, we find the denotations of the words Apurva, &c., to be exactly similar to those of the words cow and the like and it is only when suchi denotations have been directly pointed out by the words, that they are capable of indirectly indicating the genus Being.
ataśca naiva gośabdo gosattāmabhidhāsyati /	And hence we cannot admit the word Cow to denote the being of the cow.
gotvākhyākṛtivācyatvasaṃdehāttu vicāryyate	It may be argued that in the case of Injunctions that refer to Individuals we could accept the words to denote Individuals while in those referring to Classes, these could be accepted to be denoted by the words.
uccate kāryayogitvādgamyate vyaktivācyatā / śabdaśaktyanurodhāttu nākṛtervyatiricyate	But this would not be quite right because we have already proved by arguments that a word can have only one meaning otherwise if many significations of words were accepted such a process would necessitate the most unreasonable assumptions of indefinite relationships, endless, invisible, expressive potencies, and would be open to all the eight objec tions that have been shown to appertain to all options and moreover such assumptions would be absolutely uncalled for as a comprehension of the word could be accomplished by means of any one of the various assumed significations.
kiṃ tāvatprāptam	D It may be askedhow then have we an idea of the Class? To this, Iutra replies the sutra Because of nondisjunction.
nityaṃ yathaiva śabdānāmānātānāṃ prayojane /	That is to say, inas much as the Class is always cognised along with the Individual, when ever the Individual happens to be denoted by a word, it indicates its. concomitant the Class also.
arthapratyāyanārthatvātta śenāvadhāraṇā ākṛtirthyādi śabdārthaḥ kasya syuḥ prokṣaṇādayaḥ / kena cejyeta na tyāga ākṛtarupapadyate /	It is with a view to this that it is said in the Tadbhūtādhikaraṇa Ii that when a certain meaning of a word has been accepted, it is not possible to reject it and hence any other meaning that it may be found to have must be held to be indirectly indicated by it.
ta smādyena śabdārthena prayogacodanānāṃ bhāvo bhavati sa evābhyupagantuṃ nyāyyo na tattvajñānamātradṛṣṭasiddhyarthapadārthakalpanā yukteti / syādetaḍyaktisaṃbhavatprayogacodanāsu vyaktyarthastatonyatrākṛtyartha eva bhaviṣyatīti /	If it were a Class that was denoted by the word, it would belong equally to all the Individuals included therein, and it could never be rightly ascertained, which one of these was actually meant in any particu lar instance whereas when it is an Individual that is denoted by the word it can point to one Class only of which it is a unit and as such, in this case the notion of the Class would be obtained by means of the in direct indication of the same word that directly denotes the Individual whereas in the former case we would have to postulate a certain unheard of faculty in the word by which it could bring about the notion of the Individual, while directly denoting the Class.
tadasat /	For these reasons, we conclude that it is the Individual that constitutes the denotation of a word.
nyāyena hi sthitamekasya śabdasyāyeṃ kyamanava sthita saṃvandhāne kādṛṣṭa vācaka śakti kalpanavikalpadoṣaprasaṅgāt / saṃbadvānāṃ cārthānāmanyatarābhidhānenaivetaratra pratipattisiddheḥ /	As for the other innumerable alternatives spoken of above, none of these can be rightly accepted, as we have notions of all these along with that of the Individual which alone can be accepted as denoted by the word. Sutra Also because words would not denote a substance if its denotation consisted of the Class, there would be no coordination with Adjectives. According to us, the word denoting the Individual, there would be a coordination with adjectives while according to the Classtheory, there being no denotation of any individual substances by the word, there would be as great a divergence between the noun and its qualify ing Adjective as between the Cow and the Horse.
yatastu nityameva vyaktyā kṛtyoravibhāgastasmādyaktirabhihitā satī śaknotyevākṛtiṃ gamayitum /	Whether the word be accepted to denote the Individual as specified by the Class and a certain property, or the Individual alone by itself, there would always “be a coordination, if our view of the case is accepted.

The way in which the Bhashya has taken the sutra has necessita ted the acceptance of an indirect signification of the word dravya, which is made to indicate that which is contained in the dravyaviz., Property, as also the acceptance of the negative particle forming part of a com pound, of which it is not in a position to form a part inasmuch as it is dependent for its full significance upon a certain word signifying existence which is not contained in the compound.
tasmādyaktireva śabdārtho nākṛtiḥ /	The meaning thus got at from the sutra would be that in accordance with the Classtheory, there could be no word expressive of the properties of an object.
na ca vikalpasamañcaya saṃbandha samudāyānyatara viśiṣṭānyatarābhidhānapaścāḥ saṃbhavantyavibhāgādeva sarveṣāmapi jñānasiddheḥ	But we a Ja have rejected this interpretation, because it is too farfetched, and necessitates our having recourse to the secondary siguification of the word dravya pointed out by something the expression does not exist, which is supplied from without and is not contained in the com pound itself.

And hence, whichever of the two theories be accepted, the meaning of the said Injunction must be accepted to be, that the altar that is made should have the shape of the Cyana bird, just as a lump of flourpaste is made into the shape of a lion.
tadatikliṣṭaṃ vyadhikaraṇanirdiṣṭaguṇaprayogāheṃ cetyupeścitavyam / tatrāpi caivamaścarārthaṃ mā trasaṃbhavayojanā /	And this can be done only in accordance with the shape that belongs to the whole class Çyna, in contradistinction to those borne by other classes of animals, and not with the shape or specific character of any individual Cyēna bird, in contra distinction to that of another individual bird of the same class.
dravyāśrayasya guṇasya yaḥ śabdo 'dravyaśabdaḥ sa ākṛternirguṇatvādekavākya saṃbandhaṃ gotvaṃ śuklamityādivanna pratipadyate/	And as for the similarity of the mere individual i.e., mere individuality in general, it is a purely abstract property, and being entirely independent of all notions of either the genus or the species, it would be common to all substances alike and hence it cannot be accepted as constituting the denotation of any word.
ekavyaktiparigrahācca vyaktyantareṇa sādṛśyaṃ na kāryyaṃ syāt /	And if the similarity of the altar were made according to the shape of a certain individual Çyena, then, in that case, the altar could not be accepted as similar to the Çyena by another person, who may not have seen that particular individual Çyena and hence the Injunction could not have served its purpose for this latter person.
tasmācyena vitkriyā vyaktau śabdārthena saṃbhavati / na sādhakatama iti/	Hence we conclude that the building of the Çyenaaltar could never be properly accomplished if the word Çyena were accepted as denoting an individual Cyena. In the compound Cyênacita, the word Cyena cannot be taken as the principal instrument.

And as for the theory of the denotation of the Individuals themselves, it is open to many objections for instance, in that case no relationship of the expresser and the expressed could ever be expressed in words because of the impossibility of laying down as many such descriptions as there are Individuals there would always be a vagueness in the use of the words that is to say, the word cow could not be accepted by any individual person to denote any other Cow than the one with reference to which he might have learnt the word there would never be any idea of cows in general and lastly, there would be the necessity of postulating a distinct expressive potentiality for the word cow with reference to each individual cow that may crop up, thereby necessitating the assumption of endless potentialities.
etena svatantrobhayābhidhānamārgaḥ pratyuktaḥ /	The same arguments serve to set aside the two theories that it is the Individual, as apart from the Class, that is denoted by the word, and it is the Class, independently of the individuals, that is denoted by it.

And as for the denotation resting in the Relationship of the Class and the Individual, or in a mixture of the two, there can be no conception of these Relationship and Mixture independently by themselves, specially as by themselves they are capable of being taken with regard to all the objects in the world and not restricted to the Class and the Individual and hence they must be accepted as qualifying the objects.
tatrāpi śaktitraya kalpanā / vyaktyaṃśe coktadoṣaprasaṅgaḥ /	related and mixed and thus these theories would necessitate the assump tion of a triple potency in the word but even in this the assumption of any expressive potency with regard to the Indi vidual would be open to all the objections urged above against the Indivi dualtheory.
ākṛtiviśiṣṭopi vyaktiviśeṣo naiva pratīyate vyaktiviśeṣabuddhyabhāvād vyaktimātramiti cenna /	Nor can the word be said to denote a particular Individual as qualified by the Class, because as a matter of fact, no word is ever found to bring about the idea of any definite Individual. Nor can the word be said to denote the mere Individual in general because as a matter of fact, whenever a word is pronounced, that which it expresses is not, in the first instance, cognised as anything apart from the Class.
mātraśabdo hi sāmānyavācītyākṛtirevocyate /	And for the matter of that the word Matra mere that you have added, signifies nothing more than generality or commonality and hence such an assertion too would only point to the Class as being the object of denotation.

And as for the next higher but partially co extensive Class animal, and the next lower Class grey cow ideas of which are found to appear concurrently with the class cow, when the word happens to be pronounced with reference to an individual cow, these are indicated by the same Class cow, through the facts of its being con tuined in the former and itself containing the latter.

As for cuttiny also in the case of the Injunction of the cutting of the sacrificial animal, the action is quite possible on account of the Class being nothing absolutely distinct from the Individual as a matter of fact when certain limbs of an animal have been cut off and its skin, &c., removed, it is not recognised as any particular animal and hence the idea of cutting must be admitted to be applicable to the generic character of the animal and not to any parti cular individual concerned.

atyantavyatireke tu naiṣa dharmavidhiviṣayo vyatratiṣṭheta /	If the Class were something totally different from the Individual, it could never form the subject of any Injunction with regard to Dharma because the Class Animal being incorporeal could never form such a sub ject.

If again the Class Substance be taken to indi cate its substratum, this would be mere substance in general and certain ly this could be of no use in any sacrifice.

And as for these particular Individuals also, when they would be express ed in words, it could only be in the form of Classes and as such the objections based upon the incorporeality of these would remain effective. And as regards the specific Individualities of objects, it has been already shown that no business is carried on with reference to these. Hence we conclude that if the Class be held to be something totally different from the Individuals, we could never make out the real subject of the Injunctions of Dharma sacrifices.
sāmānādhikaraṇyādi ca prasidviviparītaṃ lakṣaṇayā kalpyam /	And even the ideas of coextensiveness that we have with regard to the cow and whiteness, in the sentence the Cow is white will, in that case, have to be explained, as obtained indirectly by means of Indication of the Individual cow by the Class Cow denoted by the word, it is an universally recognised fact that an idea of such coextensiveness is got at by direct denotation.

And even the relation of the container and the contained that is hinted at in the Bhashya as subsisting between the Class and the Individual is only an indirect or assumed one.
sāmānyāñca viśeṣalacaṇaṃ tatra nāśrayitavyam /	And here too the pointing by the general Class to the particular Individuals should not be taken as a case of Indication because it is only a case of mere hinting or pointing.

Or another her way of explaining the same fact is that, though we cognise the Class by itself to be denoted by the word, yet we do not, in the same manner, cognise the Individual, unless we have previously recognised the Class.
kena tarhi gotvagobdayorviśeṣaḥ / vyatirekāṃśasyaikatra vivaścā / gotvavāniti tu sphuṭaṃ pratyayena jātimadabhidhānaṃ vibhāgopapatteḥ /	A question is here raisedwhat then is the difference between gotva the Class Cow and the word go Cow since both are equally held to denote the Class Cow ? The difference between the two is that in the case of oneviz., the Class Oowthere is a slight difference from the Individual as, for instance, we find the individual cow belonging to the Class Cow, being clearly spoken of as gotvavan belonging to the Class Cow, which distinctly shows that there is some distinction between the Individual Cow and G the Class Cow.
sāmānyasya vopalakṣaṇatvānna bhedapaṇadoṣaḥ / bhedānāmeva cāyaṃ pratyekaṃ sarveṣāṃ vācakaḥ /	And as the expression gotvavan belonging to the Class Cow points to the Class also, the declaration of its describing the Individual is not open to the objections that have been urged against the theory of the Individual constituting the denotation of a word specially as the word is found to be expressive of every one of the Individuals as constituting the Class denoted.

Bhava=to be, being the general name given to the denotation of verbs and as the true denotation of verbs has to be duly ascertained in detail, in that place, it is not right to take it up on the present occasion.
dvitīyādāviyaṃ yasmādvistareṇa kariṣyate	To this we make the following reply What we have to deal with in the second Adhyāya, is the Bhāva, which is the name given to the denotations of the Affixes while what we are going to consider now is the denotation of the roots themselves.
pratyayārthasya bhāvasya vācyatā pratipāditā / prakṛtyarthavivekārthaṃ vicāraḥ kriyate 'dhunā yā coktā bhāṣyakāreṇa yāgāderabhidheyatā /	The fact of the roots yajind the like denoting the sacrifice, &c., that will be put forward by the Bhashya in the Second Adhyāya, is only by way of an explanation of what is duly ascertained in the present Adhikaraṇa. Or, even with regard to the denotations of the rootsyaji, &c., it is only proper that we should consider whether the denotations of these appearing in verbs, consist of the Class or of the Individual. In reality, however, the question that has to be dealt with in the Second Adhyāya is as to whether the transcendental result of the sacrifice proceeds from what is signified by the verbs in the Injunctions, should sacrifice, &c.
siddhā seha vivekārthaṃ tatra bhāvasya bhāṣitā nāmākhyātapade tena kasyārthasyābhidhāyake / kimākṛteruta vyaktariti cintā pravarttate	or from the materials, &c., Soma and the like therein spoken of? And whatever else is to be explained there is only by way of supplementing the said question. Thus then, it is with regard to the truly expressive Verbs and Nouns, that we proceed to consider whether they denote Classes or Individuals. A doubt on this point has arisen in our minds, on account of the usage of words, and their comprehension by the people pointing equally to both Class and Individual, and also on account of grammatical works notably the Mahabhyashya lending countenance to both the theories.
kathaṃ lacaṇasaṃbandhaścintāyāḥ prakṛtena vā / smṛtimūla vicāreṇa vaktavyaṃ tvidamāditaḥ	Objection Before proceeding any further, it must be explained, what connection this discussion has, either with the subjectmatter of the Adhyaya which treats of the means of knowing Dharma, or with that of the present Päda, which is dealing with the basic authority of the Smrtis. Reply The present discussion is an offshoot of the treatment of the authority of grammatical Smrtis, by means of which the correctness of a word having been ascertained, it is only natural to pass on to the con sideration of the meaning of this word.
vaktavyaḥ pūrvamartha śvecchabdarūpanirūpaṇāt /	But it is before the form of the word is ascertained that its meaning should be ascertained because until the meaning is known the correct ness of the word cannot be ascertained.
nahi vācyamavijñāya sādhutvamavadhāryyate vācyamātre hi sādhutvamavijñāte na labhyate / na cākṛtyā na ca vyaktyā vinā tannopapadyate vyaktirvācyeti vijñānaṃ na sanmūlamasaṃbhavāt /	It is only until the word has been known to have some meaning that its correctness cannot be ascertained and certainly an ascertainment of the correctness of a word does not depend upon our duly ascertaining as to whether its meaning is in the form of a Class or an Individual. Smrtis having been laid down in a previous Adhikaraṇa, it is with regard to this universality of their authority that the present Adhikaraṇa raises à question, and comes to the conclusion that the grammatical Smrti which speaks of the Individual as forming the denotation of a word, cannot be accepted as correct, because such an assertion being impossible, can have no authoritative basis in the Veda and hence on this point even a gram matical Smrti cannot be accepted as authoritative.
tena vyākaraṇepodṛg na pramāṇaṃ smṛtirmatā	In this manner, the present Adhikarana would be laying down an exception to the authority of Smrtis and thus it would be quite in connection with the subjectmatter of the Adhyaya and the Pada, as also with the foregoing discussion.
nanu cākṛtipakṣepi vyaktāveva kriyākriye / śabdārthe saṃbhavāttena kimarthaiṣā vicāraṇā vyaktipaśce vikalpaḥ syātkauṇḍinye dadhitakrayoḥ / sāmānya vākyada / rbalyā ttakramevetaratra tu	Objection Even if the word be admitted to be denotative of the Class, all Injunctions and Prohibitions would refer only to the Individuals signified by the words contained in them and as such what is the use of the present discussion ? Reply Though it is true that there is no difference among people, in the interpretation of the Prohibitions and the Injunctions contained in the Veda which are always taken with reference to Individuals, yet a discussion like the present would serve a useful purpose in ordinary parlance, where it is said give the curd to the Brahmanas, but takra to Kaundinya where if words were admitted to be denotative of Individuals, the word Brāhmaṇa could be accepted as denoting the Individual Brāhmaṇa Kaundinya, who would thus come to be given both the curd and the takra while when the word Brāhmaṇa is accepted as denotative of the Class only, it could point to Kaundinya only by indirect indication, which would be set aside in favour of the direct denotation of the word Kaundinya itself and Kaundinya would, in this case, receive the takra only, which was meant by the person issuing the instruction.
procaṇaṃ pūrvapakṣepi karttavyaṃ laukikeṣvapi / brīhiṣu śrutisāmarthyādvādhitvā sannidhikramam	As a matter of fact, however, in the Veda too, in the case of the passages enjoining the washing of the Corn, there is a certain difference in the true denotation of the word vrihi as also in the case of the passage that lays down the offering of Dadhi.
evaṃ homepi dadhyādau prakṛte prakṛte 'tha vā / prakṛte śrutivācyasya homatvasyāpi saṃbhavāt	So also in the case of the offering of Dadhi, the word Dadhi could refer to the sacrificial Dadhi as well as to any ordinary Dadhi and it is only when the word is held to be denotative of the Class, that the offering spoken of directly by the word Juhoti would come to refer to the sacri ficial Dadhi only.
nanu gauritiśabdādau sarvametadvicāritam /	These arguments could be applied to many other instances of Vedic Injunctions and Prohibitions.
tena tena gatārthatvātpunaścintā na yujyate	And hence we conclude that the present discussion being found to serve many useful purposes, we must take it up for due consideration.

punarasyāḥ pratijñāyā heturapya bhidhāsyate	And even the Bhashya has said towards the close of the section Akriti in the Tarkapāda that the reasons in support of the proposition will be explained later on and this can only be taken as referring to the present Adhikaraṇa.
vyaktirvācyā na vetyetadgatārthaṃ vicāryyate ekatve sati karttavyo vicāraḥ śabdavācyayoḥ /	be different, there would be no doubt as to the true denotation of words which would be found in the Veda to signify Individuals and there would be no occasion for the discussion that follows specially as all business is carried on with regard to concrete objects, there would be no use wasting time over the pure denotations of words hence the present discussion cannot be held to be propounded for the sake of the ordinary business of the world.
alaukikeca śabdārthe vācyavācakarūpayoḥ / ajñātayorna jāyeta saṃdeho vācyavastuni	For if the words in the Veda were totally different from those in ordinary parlance, then, whenever we would come across a Vedic passage, we would not be cognisant of their forms or signification and these being totally unknown, there could be no doubt in our minds, with regard to the denotation of these words.
abhedakāraṇaṃ cātra pratyabhijñānameva te /	Therefore for the sake of ascertaining the nature of the meaning that is cognised, it is necessary, in the first instance, to establish the fact of the words in the Veda and the objects denoted by them being the same as those in ordinary parlance.
anyattūpacayatvena tena cintā na yujyate	And hence no further discussion on the point is necessary.
vyapadeśādibhedācca kathaṃ bhedo na jāyate / tatrānuktamidaṃ vaktuṃ vicāroyaṃ pravarttitaḥ	It has not been explained there why the fact of words in the Veda being spoken of of as Vedic, in contradistinction to those in ordinary parlance which are described as worldly, cannot be taken as pointing to a difference between them and it is this that we proceed to consider now.
arthābhede ca cinteyaṃ śabdābhede tu satyapi / ghaṭate kasya vācyatvaṃ vyaktyā kṛtyoīyorapi	Even though the identity of the word may have been established under the said sutra, yet the present Adhikarana cannot be said to be a mere repetition because what is considered here is whether the denotations of the word Cow as found in the Veda and as used in ordinary parlance are identical.
bhedābhedanimittābhyāṃ kriyate saṃśayodbhavaḥ / kiṃ prāptamucyate bhinnau śabdārthai/	And it is only when the identity of the denotation has been established, that there can arise a question as to whether the Class or th the Individual is denoted by the word, which question can have nothing to do with the identity of the word and hence the present discussion is absolutely necessary as preliminary to the main point of the Adhikaraṇa.
lokavedayoḥ /	And on this subject, there arises a doubt in our mind because the fact of the words used in the Veda being spoken of as Vedic in contra distinction to the worldly words, points to the fact of there being a difference between the two classes of words while as a matter of fact the words in the Veda are always recognised to be the same as those in ordinary parlance.
vyapadeśasya bhinnatvādākhyāyā lakṣaṇasya ca / kharoccāraṇabhedācca lopavyatyayadarśanāt	The words used in the Veda, and the objects denoted by them, are different from those in ordinary parlance because we perceive an actual difference in their names, in the Nouns used in them, in the grammatical rules applying to them, in accentuation and pronunciation, and in deletions and modifications of letters and syllables because we find even the ordinarily known words used in the Veda, together with such words as svaru yūpa and the like, which are distinctly different from any words in ordinary usage because certain points of time are laid down as unfit for the studying of Vedic words because the Cüdra and the woman are forbidden to utter Vedic words and because we find such words as Agvabala and the like signifying distinctly different objects in the Veda and in ordinary parlance, in the Veda it being used in the sense of reed, while in ordinary usage it means the horses hair? The Bhashya has also cited the word Agni as having in the Vedain the passage Agni killed the Vrttras a meaning vrttra killer different from that in ordinary parlance.
tadayuktaṃ kriyābhede kartṛbhedo hi neṣyate /	But this is not right because a difference in the action does not alter the actor i.e., though Agni may be said to have killed the Vrttras, yet that does not neces sarily make Agni something other than the Agni that burns.
dantikartṛtvamagneśca padārthebhyaḥ pratīyate asatā kathamanyattvaṃ karmāṇātaḥ pratīyate / apūrve vṛtraśabdārthe kriyāśabde'pyalaukike	new signification of the word Agni as that which killed the Vrttras is denoted by the word Agni because it is in the form of a pure Arthavāda in praise of Agni and also because the passage cannot be taken as describing a real action of Agni, as will be explained by the Bhashya under the Devatadhikarana of the Ninth Adhyaya.
tenoktasyaiva śabdasya trivṛḍhādernavādiṣu	For these reasons, the words that should be quoted as showing a difference between the meanings of words in the Veda and in ordinary parlance, are Trurit, &c., which in the Veda means ninefold while in ordinary usage it means threefold.
tadaṃ satyaṃ na śabdasya bhedorthaguṇakāritaḥ / tena svarādibhedana vaktavyā bhinnarūpatā	In connection with the abovementioned passage Agnirvrttrāṇi janghanat the Bhashya has said that this points to another form of the word Agni but this is scarcely correct as a difference in the property or action of the object denoted does not make any difference in the form of the word itself. Therefore the difference between the forms of Vedic and ordinary words must be held to be based upon the differences of accentuation, &c., as explained above, and not upon any differences in their significations.
tāveva vede śabdārtho loke yāviti bhāṣyate / vedasyaiva prasajyeta sakalasyāpramāṇatā tantravārtike /	The words used in the Veda and their meanings are the same as those in ordinary parlance. Because if it were not so, the whole of the Veda would become absolutely unauthoritative as as its an authority would be fully shaken by the fact of its meaning being unknown and this nonrecog nition of the meaning of Vedic passages would lead to the contingencies that there would be no such Vedic actions as the Agnihotra and the like, and there could be no Vedic Injunctions because the Injunctive affixes in the Veda could not signify Injunction because they have this significa tion in ordinary parlance.
bhāvaḥ pratyayārthasya vidherapratipādanāt / arthāntare ca śabdasya na prayogo vidhīyate	Nor does the Veda lay down the use use of words any sense other than the ordinarily known ones because it has been shown above that the relationship between words and their meanings is not fixed by scriptures and hence there would be no means of ascertain ing what any word means in the Veda, if the ordinary meaning were not accepted.
vaidikeṣvapi śabdeṣu pratyakṣeṇa punaḥ punaḥ / yahā vibhāgaśabdena śabdasyoccāraṇe sati	Or b the nondifference Avibhāga spoken of may be taken as pointing out the fact that whenever the word Cow is uttered, we have always the same cognition of the class Cow whether the word be found in the Veda or in ordinary usage. Or c it may be taken as pointing to the non difference of the rules of pronunciation, &c., as appertaining to the Veda and to ordinary parlance.
sarvathā śakyate bhedo na vaktuṃ śabdavācyayoḥ /	In no way can the word, as found in the Veda, and its meaning be held to be different from those in ordinary parlance because it is only when they are accepted to be identical that the fact commonly recognised by all sacrificers is not contradicted.
ekatve yājñikānāṃ ca prasiddhiranugṛhyate	As all persons that perform the sacrifices laid down in the Veda accept the words that they meet with in Vedic passages to have the same mea meaning that they have in ordinary parlance.
pratyakṣapratyabhijñāte vedaśabde 'nyarūpatā / vyapadeśādibhedaśca svarabhedādikāritaḥ nānyatvaṃ yujyate bādhātpratyakṣa pratyabhijñayā /	The Mimansa supplies the only means of ascertaining the true meanings of the words in the Veda and in Mimansã we do not find the fact of the words in the Veda being called Vedic in contradistinction to worldly accepted as pointing to any actual difference between the words themselves. Thus then, the words being actually recognised to be the same in both cases, the only difference in their forms that can be perceived, as also the fact of one being named Vedic and the other worldly, must be accepted as due to erences accentuation, &c.
vacanāmabhedastu śūdravarjitatāpi vā na ca bhinnatvamanyeṣu prajñātārtheṣu yujyate /	As for the fact of only certain times being laid down as fit for the study of Vedic words, and that of its utterance being prohibited for the Cudra, these, as laid down directly in Vedic sentences, are properties appertaining to the utterance of Vedic words, as are also the methods of accentuation and none of these can point to any difference in the words themselves.
uttānānāṃ ca keṣāṃ cidahatāṃ na vidhīyate prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda / uttānetyādikā tena nāto bhedaḥ pratīyate /	In the case of the passage the cows of the gods walk upon their backs which has been quoted as pointing to the fact of the meaning of the word Cow being different from the ordinary cowit is not found to lay down the fact of the character of the cow to belong to certain animals walking on their backs and hence inas much as any such animals are absolutely impossible, and the meaning of the word Cow is not cognised as anything different from the ordinary, and as the passage itself is found to be supplementary to another Injunc tion, it cannot but be taken as a mere Arthavāda.
tasmādyāveva śabdārthoṃ loke pūrvaṃ nirūpitā	Thus then, in no way do we perceive any difference between the two classes of words and hence we conclude that the words and their meanings that have been explained before, in connection with ordinary usage, must be accepted to be the same in the Veda also.
kimākṛteḥ padārthatvaṃ, kiṃ vyaktaḥ, kiṃ iyoriti / bahavaḥ pratibhāntyatra pakṣāḥ pratipadaṃ ca ye	And now, we proceed to take up the question, to which the above discussion leads us,namely, does the denotation of a word consist of the Class, or of the Individual, or of both ? There are various alternatives on this point and in order to remove all misconceptions with regard to it, we again proceed to show them.
jātirvyaktiśca saṃbandhaḥ samūho liṅgakārake / saṃkhyā ca saptamī teṣāmaṣṭapakṣī dayodvayoḥ	Whenever the word Cow is uttered, it is found to give rise to the ideas of seven things the Class, the Individual, their Relationship, the Aggregate of these, a particular Gender, Case, Number, and the Word itself. In this manner there are eight alternatives with regard to each of these two.
jātisaṃbandhayorevaṃ sāmānya samudāyayoḥ aṣṭau paścā niyoktavyāḥ ṣaḍḍiḥ pratyekamuktavat / evamānantyameteṣāṃ pacaṇāmi gamyate vyakterjātiviśiṣṭāyā viparītamathāpi vā /	For instance, is it the Class that is denoted by the word, or the Individual, or both, or each of them alternately, or both together, or the Class qualified by the Individual, or the Individual qualified by the Class ? In the same manner we would have as many alternatives, between the Class and the Relationship, the Class and the Aggregate, the Class and the Case, the Class and the Number, the Gender and the Class, and so forth also with regard to each of them as taken all along with all others, thereby we come to have alternatives six times eight or fortyeight in number and yet many other combinations being possible, the number of alternatives becomes endless.
upanyāsena caiteṣāṃ jñeyāḥ sarve prapañcitāḥ tenādya dāveva pacau vicāryeta kimākṛtiḥ śabdārtho, vyakti riti /	In the Purvapaksha, the Bhashya has mentioned only four of these alternatives Does the word signify the Class by itself, or the Individual by itself, or the Individual qualified by the Class, or the Class qualified by the Individual? And these should be taken as including all the other alternatives and as all these are set aside by means of the same arguments, they have not been all pointed out in detail.
bhāṣyakāreṇa ca saṃśayakāraṇamuktaṃ sāmānyapratyayādyaktī ca kriyāsaṃbhavādityetadayukta, vyakterapi pratoyamānatvātkathaṃ jātereva pratītirupanyasyate /	And hence at first we take up for consideration only two of the alternativesDoes the word denote the Class or the Individual ? The ground of doubt on this point has been explained by the Bhashya thus samanyapratyayadvyaktau ca kriyasambhavat because the cognition is that of the Class, while the action that is laid down can pertain to the Individual. But this is not quite correct because the Individual is often found to be cognised and hence it is not quite correct to speak of the Class as being the cognised in all cases.
yadi ca vyakti saṃpratīyeta tataḥ saṃśaya eva na syātkimabhidhīyate 'neneti /	For if the Individual were never cognised by means of the word, there could be no question as to whether it is denoted by the word or not.
na ca kriyāsaṃbhavo 'bhidheyatve kāraṇavyaktyanta rāṇāmapi prasaṅgāt /	Nor can the fact of the action appertain ing to the Individual serve as a reason for accepting it to be denoted by the word.
tena pūrvoktameva saṃśayakāraṇaṃ mantavyam /	Because the question may be taken as put by one who has not quite understood the nature of the Class as explained before.
prayogapratītyoḥ sādhāraṇatvācchāstrāntare vyaktipaścābhyupagamātsaṃśayaḥ /	This explanation of Class in the Bhashya does not serve either to assert the existence of the Class, or to bring forward proofs for its exis tence it only serves to distinguish the Class from the Individual.
yadvā śabda uccārite sāmānyapratyayād vyaktyākṛtyoḥ sāmānyāttulyātpratyayād vyaktau ca prabdādākṛtāvālambhana sparśana śyena sadṛśacayanādi kriyāsaṃbhavātmā mānye vyaktau ca pratyayākriyāsaṃbhavāditi coktam /	And it cannot mean that the Individual con sists of the specific peculiarities themselves the said compound being ex plained as Karmadharaya because in a subsequent chapter, the Bhashya distinctly speaks of the Individual as the receptacle of and as such something different from the peculiarities and also because we have cer tain Smrti texts that point out the Individual to be different from the peculiarities. Hence we conclude that it is only right to start the question as to whether the word denotes the Class or the Individual. And for all these reasons, we conclude that it is the Individual that is denoted by the word. Some people might askWhy should we not accept both the Individual and the Class to be denoted by the word? That would be quite in keeping with usage and comprehension. This cannot be because this would involve the assumption of a manifold potency in the word, which is not allowable specially as the comprehension of the one the Class can very well be explained as being due to the intimate relationship that it bears to the other the Individual and hence we must accept the Individual to be denoted by the word.
kā panarākṛtiḥ kā vyaktiriti /	It may be asked How then do you explain the idea of com monality that we have? We can explain this as brought about by its relationship to the Individuals.
kathaṃ punarayaṃ praśno yadā gaurityetasya śabdasya kortha ityatra jātinirūpitā /	This cannot be because this too would necessitate the assumption of manifold poten cies in each word and as, in that case, the denotation being always uncertain, the true meaning of an Injunction would always remain doubtful.
naiṣa doṣaḥ /	There is a difficulty in the Bhashya here.
yenaitantra jñātamasau pṛcchati kā punarākṛtiḥ kā vyaktiriti / saṃdehāḍā 'tra punarubhayasminpratīyamāne kā vyaktiḥ kiyatī vā jātiriti /	Having started the questionhow then do we have an idea of commonality?the Bhashya replies the Class would serve as the mark? But the reply is quite irrelevant because what was wanted to be known was the reason for the idea of commonality, while what the reply points out is the ground for applying the same word to many Individuals! Therefore we must take the Bhashya here to be elliptical, explaining it thus Question How then do we have an idea of commonality? Answer Through the relationship it bears to the Individuals. Question But how is the same word applicable to another Individual ? AuswerThrough the Class which serves as the mark common to all of them.
yau tāvadajñānasaṃśayavādinau tayoḥ svarūpakathanamātreṇaiva nirākaraṇaṃ vaktavyam / yastu viparītavādī tasyaiva nirākaraṇamabhidhīyate /	Or, we may explain the Bhashya in the following manner Being asked How then do we have an idea of commonality?the Purvapakshi, finding himself un able to absolutely deny the said idea of commonality, seeks refuge in the theory that the word denotes the Individual qualified by the Class, the meaning of the word cihna being qualification, and the passage akytiçeihnabhūta bhavishyati, meaning that the Class commonality could be recognised as the qualification of the Individual.
yadyapi jātirvyakteratyanta bhinnā nopalabhyate, tathāpi śavalākāra tasmiprathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Thus then, even the idea of commonality cannot be urged against the Individualistic theory. And we conclude that the denotation of a word consists of the Individual, either by itself, or as qualified by the Class. And it is only then that we can accept the number six in the sentencesix cowsto belong to the cows Sūtra .
nupalabhyamāne sāmānyabuddherālambanaṃ prathamapādoktena nyāyenākatiritarā vyaktiḥ / na cānena granthena jāteḥ sadbhāvaḥ pramāṇaṃ vā pratipādyate vyaktarvivekaḥ kevalaḥ kathyate /	And also in the case of the Injunction that, if the animal kept for a sacrifice happens to be lost, we should obtain another of the same colourunless we accept the word animal to denote the individual animal, the word another could not point to another animal nor would it be possible to speak of this another as being of the same colour. Because if the whole Class Animal were denoted by the word Animal the one animal would be as much an animal as the other and hence even if another animal had to be fetched, it would not be another but the same Animal nor can the Class be said to be of the same colour as the former animal.
tenaivābhiprāyeṇa mātraśabdaprayogo 'nyathā tasya gatārthataiva bhavet / yadapyukta nūnaṃ kāpyatyantabhinnā jātirabhipreteti /	In the same manner, it is equally impossible to build up the Class Cyena with bricks and mortar, as it is created by God alone such an interpretation would necessitate the assumption of some purpose for this making of the Class and also the taking of the word cinvita in a sense not its own and this would also involve a breach of the grammatical rule quoted above. Hence the passage cannot be taken even to mean that one should make the Class Cyena. b Thus then, the only resource left to us is to take the passage to mean that by the building collection of bricks one should make an altar of the shape of the Cyenā bird.
tasyāpyuttaraṃ dravyaguṇakamaṇāṃ sāmānyamātramākṛtirabhipretā nātyantavyatiriktati / dravyādīnāṃ ca sarveṣāṃ yatmāmānyaṃ sattārūpaṃ tadanena nirdiśyate, tannirdeśanāvāntara sāmānyānāmapi nirdeśasiddhiḥ /	In this case it is impossible for the altar to be made similar to any particular Çyēna bird and we cannot make it similar to all the individual birds specially as it is absolutely impossible ascertain the similitude of such birds as have not yet been born, or of those that are yet to be born and it is only possible to make an altar having a shape that is common to the whole Class Cyena. Hence we conclude that the Class alone can be held to be denoted by the word. An objection is here raised Why cannot the passage be taken to mean that one should build up the altar with the bodies of dead Cyena birds, the compound Cyenacitam being taken as Cyennaiçcitam the Instrumental Tatpurusha ? To this question, the Bhashya replies that the word Cyena is the S objective and not the Instrument.
yaddā /	But this is not correct.
sāmānyaśabdasya pratyekaṃ saṃvandhāhavyatvādīni cīṇi sāmānyāni nirdiśyante sattayā vyavahārābhāvāt /	to an indirect signification in one case than in many. And as for the Instrumental Tatpurusha in Cyenacita we can accept it, as being absolutely necessary. For these reasons it being possible to take the passage to mean that one should make the altar of the bodies of Cyena birds,and because it is only when the word is accepted as denoting the Individual, that there can be different numbers and cases in connection with Nouns, we must conclude that a word always denotes the Indi.
atha vā /	vidual.
mātraśabdaprayogāhavyādiṣu yāvantyavāntarasāmānyāni mahāsāmānyaṃ ca tatsarvamabhidhīyate /	If the Individuals were denoted by the word, then, inasmuch as the individual cows are found to have various characterssuch as the variegated colour, absence of horns, &c., the idea brought about by the word would be a mixed one partaking of all these characters, while as a matter of fact we find the word giving rise to a single uniform conception of the Commonality and thus too we conclude that it is the Class that is denoted by the word.
asādhāraṇa viśeṣā yasyāṃ vyaktau seyamasādhāraṇa viśeṣā, na tvasādhāraṇāśca te viśeṣāśceti sāmānādhikaraṇyaṃ saṃbhavati /	When a person is ordered to bring the cow, if no particular cow happens to be specially pointed out, either by the character of the work in hand or by found to bring in any common cow, and not any particularly specified cow, or all the cows in the world. If, however, the individual cow were denoted by the word, then the mention of the word Cow would have pointed to all the individual cows in the world, which would have to be brought in by the person ordered or he could bring in only that one particular cow which would be denoted by the word. But as a matter of fact we find that he brings in any common cow, with the only restriction that it should possess the common character of the Cow.
upariṣṭādviśeṣādhārasya vyaktitvābhidhānāt /	that the class is denoted but the fact is that it appears as the qualifica tion of the individual, occupying only a secondary position while the individual forms the primary element in the denotation of a word.
smṛteśca /	But all this is not quite to the point.
tena samyagabhihitaṃ kimākṛtirvā vyaktiriti /	Thus then, if the Class be held to be denoted by the word Cow, it is this alone that can be accepted as constituting the true denotation of the word.
kiṃ prāptam ālambhanaprocaṇaviśasanādiprayogacodanāyā vyaktipaśce bhāvādākṛtipakṣe cābhāvādvāhāṇo na intavyaḥ surā na pātavyetyādipratiṣedhacodanāyāśca vyaktipaścaeva saṃbhavāddevadatta gāmabhyājetyevamādilokikavyavahāra codanāyāścopapattevyaktiḥ śabdārtha iti niścīyate /	qualified by the possession of the stick whereas the word Cow cannot be said to be incapable of being used with reference to the Class Cow, and as such, necessarily pointing to the Individual as qualified by the Class. Because in the case of such expressions as Cyenavita and the like, we actually find the word Cyêna used with reference to the Class. And also from invariable concomitance, both negative and positive, we con clude that the word denotes the Class for instance, in the passage speak of the Çyenacita, we actually find the word Cyêna used with reference to the Class and we never find any instance of a word being used with reference to the Individual independently of the Class. The above arguments also serve to reject all the other alternative theories that have been put forward with regard to the denotation of a word. And thus we conclude that the Word denotes the Class.
saṃkhyākārakopapatteśca / yadi hi vyaktiḥ śabdārtho bhavati tato vṛkṣau vṛkṣābhyāmiti prātipadikābhihitāsu vyaktiṣu pratyayābhihitadvitvādisaṃkhyākaraṇādikārakaṃ vobhayamupapadyate, itaratra tu jāterasaṃkhyeyatvāt kārakatvāccobhayamapyanupapannam /	That is to say, even in accordance with the Classtheory, there is no disjunction of the actions of washing, &c., from the Substances or the denotation of the Class serving the purpose of pointing to a definite Sub stance, there is no disjunction of the performance of the actions mentioned above or there being no absolute difference between the Class and the Individual, the Substance is pointed out, at times in the form of the Individual, and at others, in that of the Class, in accordance with the wish of the speaker and as such words being found to denote both forms of things, even when the Individual is denoted by the word, it does not necessitate any multiplicity in the performance of the action or the Class not being totally different from the Individual, the sacrifices per formed with reference to the Individual may be accepted as performed with reference to the Class also, and vice versa and thus in no case is it necessary to make any difference in the performance of Actions or Sacri fices or both the Class and the Individual serve the purpose of accomplishing a sacrifice with reference to whichsoever of these two, the sacrifice may be performed, both of them come to be recognised as useful and as such there is no disjunction of the Actions from the Substance. Thus then, even in accordance with the Classtheory, such Actions as killing, washing, &c., being quite possible, we conclude that it is the Class that constitutes the denotation of the word. Divided into two Adhikaranas in the Vartika A.that such words as udbhid, &c., also help in the knowledge of Dharma and B.that such words are names of sacrifices.
aneka śaktikalpanāprasaṅgādekābhidhānenaiva saṃbandhāditaratra pratīterupapannatvād vyakterevābhidheyatvam / sāmānyapratyayaḥ katha miti ced vyaktisaṃbandhādupapatsyate /	Question The authority of the Veda together with the Smrtis having been established, the present was the time for considering the meanings of Veda passages which also are the means of knowing Dharma wherefore and in what connection, then, should the Bhashya before having furnished the consideration of the means of knowing Dharma, have taken up the consideration of the Names of sacrifices ? Some people offer the following explanation The question dealt with isdo the words udbhid and the like, point out the agora qu materials to be used at sacrifices or the names of sacrifices? Thus the question dealing directly with the means of knowing Dharma.
kathaṃ vyaktyantare prayogaḥ, cihnatvādākṛtarityevam / yadā kathaṃ sāmānyāvagatiriti cedityupanyaste pūrvapañcavādī sāmānyāvagatimapotumaśakkutrannā kṛtiviśiṣṭavyaktyabhiṣāmapakṣaṃ pa prathamādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	But this is not quite correct because in this manner all books could be explained as the means of knowing because all Sentences may be ex plained as dealing with the questiondoes this sentence point out this fact or that ? Some people notably the author of the Bhashya himself take the Sutra as the Purvapaksha and Sutra as the Siddhanta of the same Adhikarana but it is necessary for these people to point out what there is in Sutra that is not in keeping with the Siddhanta that it should be taken as the Pūrvapaksha.
tena kevalā viśiṣṭā vā vyaktiḥ śabdārthaḥ /	For certainly the assertion of the fact of the words like udbhid being included in that which serves the purpose of fulfilling an action is by no means unacceptable to the Siddhanti.
tathā ca ṣaḍ deyā ityevamādiṣu ṣaḍādikā saṃkhyopapatsyate /	Hence we explain these two Sutras as embodying the Siddhanta of the two Adhikaranas A.

These words have no use with regard to Dharma, because they have no connection with the performance of actions, while the Veda deals with such performance alone as has been declared elsewhere also Only three parts of the Veda viz., Vidhi, Arthavada and Mantra have an authority with regard to Dharma and the words in question being different from all these three, they can serve no useful purpose with regard to Dharma and as such they are absolutely useless.
tasmādākṛtipaśceṣyācammanādisaṃbhavādākṛtireva śabdārtha iti siddham tantravārtike /	These words cannot be said to be included in Vidhi because they do not signify either the Means or the Result or the Method of any sacrifices they are are different from Arthavada, because they do not signify any Praise they cannot be said to serve the purpose of a Mantra because they do not indicate any accessories Material, Deity, &c.

na tāvadarthavādatvaṃ vākyaśeṣatvābhāvāt / kathaṃ punarayaṃ na vākyaśeṣo yāvatā vāyurvai kṣepiṣṭhetyādivadekavākyatā 'vagamyate /	It may be asked How can they be denied to be supplementary to a sentence, when threy are actually found in a sentence, exactly like the assertion Vāyu is the eftest deity? But it is not so that which supplementary to some thing that is enjoined, is what is known as Arthavada while the words in question do not appear apart from the Injunction itself yajeta therefore they cannot be said to be supplementary to any Sentence and we have already proved under the Audumbarādlīkaraṇa that that which is capable of being taken along with an Injunction cannot be taken as mere Praise.
na caikapadena stutirdṛṣṭā /	Nor have we ever found any Praise expressed by a single word neither do we comprehend any Praise as expressed by the word Udbhid.
yadapyuṅgedanaṃ paśūnāmanena kriyataityevaṃ prāśastyaṃ kalpyeta tadapi tṛtīyāntasamudāyāśrayabalavattarakaraṇatvaprasiddhyā bādhyate / anyathā hi prātipadikaprādhānyādā vāyurvai kṣepiṣṭhetivatprathameva prāyojyata /	Though the word could be taken as Praise, inasmuch it is capable of being ex plained as that by which trees, &c., are cut properly,yet such an interpretation would be set aside by the most rational fact of the udbhid being an Instrument in the performance of a sacrifice, as is pointed out by the Instrumental ending in the word udbhida for if mere Praise were meant, the noun would have had only the Nominative ending, as we have in the word Vayuh in the acknowledged Arthavāda Vayurvai kshēpi shtha dēvatā.
na cāsya mantratvaṃ, tādrapyeṇāpratīteḥ /	Nor can the word udbhid be taken as a Mantra because it is not recognised as one and also because the students of the Veda do not remember any such Mantra.
na caikapadatvātmākāṅkṣatvaṃ karaṇapratītyā vā smārakatvam / na caitadabhidheyaḥ kaścitprayogasamavāyyartho dṛśyate /	And being a single word it cannot be said to stand in need of something else which it would indicate exactly as the Mantra indicates the Materials and Deities of sacrifices and as it is recog nised as the Instrument, it cannot be said to bring about an idea of any. thing else in the shape of the Material or the Deity. Nor do we find the word itself denoting anything that would form the material part of a Sac rifice and no sentence that actually indicates anything not forming a material part of the Sacrifice, can be accepted as auxiliary to the sacrifice.
na cāsya sūktavākavadviniyojikā śrutirasti yena māntravarṇikadravyakalpanā syāt /	If we set about assuming a material to be indicated by the Mantra in the shape of the word Udbhid, it would be a most unwarrantable complica tion of matters. Nor do we find any Vedic text, like the Süktavāka which lays down the fact of certain Mantras being employed at certain sacrifices laying down the employment of this word as a Mantra so that the afore said assumption of the material too is not possible.
ataścāvi niyuktatvādiṣe tvādivadapi nādhyāhāreṇa nirākāṅkṣīkṛtya pra yogaḥ /	Nor again is the word itself capable of being employed as a Mantra so that we cannot even assume any Injunctions of its employment, as we do in the case of the Mantra Ishe tva and the rest.
sphuṭaṃ ca brāhmaṇenaikavākyatvamityamantratvam /	And lastly, it is evident that the word forms part of the Brāhmaṇa passage udbhida yajēta and as such, it cannot be taken as a Mantra.
tasmādidhyuddeśāntargatasyaivottarādhikaraṇena vicāryate guṇavidhirnāmadheyamiti /	Thus then, it being clear that the word forms part of the subject of the Injunction itself, we proceed to consider the question as to whether the word constitutes the Injunction of a Material, or it is only the name of a Sacrifice. It is the material are that is enjoined by the word udbhidā because the universally recognised fact is mostly authoritative be.
prātipadikaṃ tāvadudbhedanasamarthe dravye khanitrādāvayavaprasiddhyā pravartate /	cause a distinctly useful purpose is served and because this inter pretation is much more capable of prompting men to the performance of the particular action, than any other.
na ca samudāyo 'rthāntaravācī loke prasiddhaḥ / na ca lokādanavagato 'rtho vedādavagamyate saṃvandhasya śāstrā hetutvāt /	a That is to say, it is an uni versally recognised fact that the noun udbhid literally signifies a cutting instrument the Axe nor is the word udbhidä known to signify anything else and the meaning of a word that is not recognised in or dinary parlance cannot be got at from the Veda because the relation ship of a word to its denotation is not fixed by the scriptures but by ordinary parlance.
tṛtīyāpi ca karaṇavācinī, kriyāyāśca śaktimad dravyaṃ tadādhārā vā śaktiḥ karaṇaṃ, tenodbhitsādhanako yāgo 'vagamyate /	As for the Instrumental ending, it signifies mere Instrumentality, and it is only a potent substance, or the potency re siding in the substance, that is known to be capable of serving as the Instrument of an Action.

Because the Class sacrifice not being a fit object of Injunction, the root yaji itself points to the Individual sacrifice and if the name udbhid be held to denote the Class sacri fice, then it ceases to be a name! That is to say, when the root itself is found to indicate the Individual sacrifice, on account of the Class which is directly denoted by it not being capable of being enjoined, then what is left to be done by the name? While if the name udbhid be held to denote the Individual sacrifice, then a generic name not being desirable for a particular sacrifice, the word would be altogether irrelevant and we shall explain later on that the object specified .e., the sacrifice being itself a wellestablished entity, the name could not be accepted as enjoining it.
yadā ca kenāpi prakāraṇodbhidādīnāṃ viśeṣavacanatvaṃ tadā tadatyantāvinābhūtasāmānyavacanatvena yajeranarthakatvam/	Even though at times it may be possible for words like udbhid to have a specific and not a generic denotation, yet even such specific denotation being invariably accompanied by the generic element, it can have no connection with the root yaji. And further, the Injunction itself becomes much simpler, if the word udbhidā is taken as laying down the material because in that case, it would be merely refering to the sacrifice enjoined elsewhere .
yadyevaṃ guṇāścitatvādidhiśakterna tarhi karma vidhīyate, tathā ca vihite karmaṇi kasya guṇo vidhīyataityānarthakyam / ata /	Against this it might be urged that, in that case the force of the Injunction having been exhausted in the laying down of the material, the sacrifice itself would remain unenjoined and then, as there would be no sacrifice laid down, there would be nothing at which the enjoined material would be employed, and hence the Injunction of the material would be absolutely useless.
prakṛtau jyotiṣṭoma iti /	In view of this objection, it is saidprakrtau jyotishtomei.e., the sacrifice is enjoined along with the jyotishtoma, of which it is an auxiliary It may, however, be urged that if all names be taken as laying down the materials to be used at the sacrifices, even the word Jyotish toma in the Injunction Jyotishtomēna yajeta would only point out a material to be employed and the sacrifice would remain as unenjoined as ever.

Or, we may take the sentence Jyotishtomēna yajēta to be the Injunction of a sacrifice performed with the particular material pointed out while the other words may be taken as Injunctions of materials only.

sidvāntābhiprāyeṇāti ke cit /	Some people reply to this that the assertion of the Jyotishtoma as the primary sacrifice is in accordance with the view of the Siddhānti who holds all such words to be names.
athavā prakriyataiti prakṛtiḥ, prakṛte jyotiṣṭoma ityarthaḥ /	Prakrti is that a consideration of which has been in troduced hence the sentence would mean that the sacrifice, at which the ulbhid would be used as a material, is enjoined in connection with the Jyotishtoma, as the passage udbhidā yajēta is found in the same con text as the Jyotishtoma sacrifice.

Another objection is raised As for the Jyotishtoma sacrifice, its original Injunction itself lays down the Somi and the Jyotishtoma as materials to be employed at it, the Injunction of any other material for it is not right. But the materials like udbhid being laid down in view of the ob taining of certain definite desirable results, these would set aside all other materials that may have been laid down in the original Injunction.

Or, it may be that though the original Injunc. tion has laid down the Jyotishtoma as to be performed with certain defi nite materials, yet the subsequent Injunctions like udbhida yajēta, could be taken as laying down other materials for the same sacrifice, the injunction of the sacrifice itself, without the material, being borrowed from the original Injunction and thus the material laid down by the subsequent Injunction would be in no way different from that laid down in the original one.

That word must be a name, which at first ap pears new because it cannot lay down the material. We proceed to explain the words of the Sutra When a wordlike udbhidis such that, when first heard, it appears new i.e., is not cognised as signifying anything definite,then, if it be come across, first of all, in a Vedic Injunction, it must be taken as a name, on account of its coextensiveness with the sacrifice enjoined. Or, the clause utpattava purvam may mean that inasmuch the word udbhid would point out a definite sacrifice not otherwise got at it would not be useless.
itarathā śrutirudbhidādīn vacyati tadvato lāyet /	Or, it may be explained thus The question being whose name would the word be ?, the Sūtra replies the name belongs to that sacrifice, the per formance of which would accomplish a particular transcendental result.

Having thus explained the implications of the noun udbhid, the Bhashya proceeds to show that the same facts are also pointed out by the Instrumental affix in udbhidā One should accomplish by means of the sac rifice, &c. Injunction by itself or as supplementary to another Injunction, the Sacrifice is recognised to be the Instrument of the accomplishment of a certain result and hence the word udbhida also with an Instrumental, ending, occurring in close proximity to the words signifying the sacrifice cannot but be taken as denoting the Instrument. The Bhashya says From the Noun which denotes the karaṇa Instrument, &c.

yathaiva brohibhiryajeta somena yajetetyādīnāṃ karaṇabhūtayā gaikavākyatve sati tṛtīyāntatvaṃ vaiyadhikaraṇyepyavirudvamevamicāpīti /	and against this, it may be argued that,“ in all cases the casesignifications being held to belong to the Terminations as is distinctly laid down in such passages as by means of the third case termination which signifies Instrumentality, &c., how can the Noun be spoken of as expressing the karana or Instrument? But this does not affect the position of the Bhashya because what is meant by the passage in question is that the Noun signifies the Substratum of the Instrumentality.

Objection The fact of the word udbhid signifying a substance being cognised by means of direct senseperception, exactly as in the case of such words as vrihi, soma and the like, wherefore is it sought to be set aside by the inference of the fact of its signify ing the Instrument ? That is to say, in the case of such sentences as somēna yajeta, even though the sacrifice is recognised as the means of obtaining a particular result, and the word somena has the Instru mental caseending, yet this is not taken alone as coextensive with the sacrifice the Soma being taken as the material and there is nothing in d very incongruous in this we could have exactly the same thing in the case in question also.

tasmādavayavadvāreṇāsti karmaṇyapi prasiddhiḥ /	That is to say, such words as Vrihi, Soma and the like have their meanings so very wellknown, that they can never be taken apart from these meanings and hence in such passages as somena yajeta, as they cannot be taken along with as coextensive with the sacrifice, we are obliged to take them as laying down the materials to be employed at the sacrifices.

Thus then, we conclude that the various parts composing the word udbhid are quite wellknown as pointing to the sacrifice.

saṃjñāsaṃjñisaṃbandha rūpeṇa vṛdvirā daijityādivadavidhānaṃ sāmānādhikaraṇyāvayavaprasidvibhyāṃ tatmiddheḥ /	and as such its coexten siveness with these can never be recognised. Or, it is only by means of the Apparent Inconsistency of the expressed coextensiveness that the bringing about udbhedana can be recognised as referring to a particular result only and as there is no such Apparent Inconsistency in the case of the Jyotishtoma, &c., the name udbhid can never be attributed to them.

But all that the Bhashya means is that the passage does not mean that one should obtain cattle by means of the sacrifice, and this sacrifice is named Udbhid because that that would involve a syntactical split but at the same time, it cannot be denied that the passage distinctly points to the fact of the name belonging to the sacrifice as the only meaning that the passage can have is that e should obtain cattle by means of the Udbhidsacrifice because it is thus alone that the passage could point to a particular sacrifice.
nanvevaṃ śabdasvarūpābhidhānaṃ prasajyeta / pratyakṣāvagatasvarūpaviśiṣṭārthābhidhānādaprasaṅgaḥ /	It may be urged that in that case you would have a denotation by the word Udbhida of the verbal form of the word which is not quite compatible with your tenets. But, as a matter of fact, the verbal form of the word Udbhid being cognised by direct Auditory Perception, it is only that which is specified by that form. that can be accepted to be denoted by the word.
sarvatra hyagṛhītaviśeṣaṇā viśiṣṭabudvirna dṛṣṭā, na tvanabhihita viśeṣaṇā /	And as for the law that there can be no idea of the qualified until there has been an idea of the quali fication, all that this law lays down is that the qualification should be cognised before there is any cognition of the qualified, and not that it should be expressed by a wordand in the case in question we have a previous cognition of the qualifying form of the word by means of Sense perception, and it is not necessary for it to be actually expressed by the Tu to word.

C And again, it is only by such names as Udbhid and the like, that the subsidiary sacrifices can be differentiated from their Primary otherwise, in the sentence Udbhida yajēta, &c., if the sacrifice were not specified by the name Udbhid, then the sentence would come to be taken only as pointing out certain other Materials and Results in connection with the Primary sacrifice itself, and not as laying down any distinct sacrifice.

And thus we find that the fact of Udbhid being the name of a sacrifice is not contrary to the fact of the passage being an Injunction though it is contrary to the fact of its being an Injunction of a particular material. And thus it is apparent that the assertion of the Purvapaksha that the word Udbhid forms part of the Injunction of a material, as also the assertion of a scion of the Siddhanti, that the Name is something apart from the three portions of the Veda, the Vidhi, the Mantra and the Arthavada,are equally wrong.
viśeṣa vyavahārāṅgabhāvācca nāpravṛttivi śeṣakaratā /	Nor can it be urged that, if the word Udbhida be taken as pointing out the name of a sacrifice, it could be of no use in prompting men to the performance of any particular action. Because we actually find such names serving distinctly useful purposes in various periods of the perfor mance of an action.

vyavahārāṅgatāṃ yāti saivodāharaṇakṣamā	As for the word pavamana, some people hold that the word has a meaning sanctifier that is pointed out by its component parts and as such this has not been cited, on account of its being included in the fore going Adhikarana.

Some people meet this difficulty by the assertion that the sen tence that should have formed part of the Siddhanta, has been inserted here by mistake. While others offer the explanation that by attributing the result to the material, it would become the principal factor in the Injunction, and thereby losing its secondary or auxiliary character, the sentence could not be spoken of as an Injunction of an Accessory detail.

Therefore, we must explain the Bhashya passage in the light of the following facts On the point at issue, there appear to be three distinct theories The word enjoins au accessory detail, as leading to a particular result it enjoins the accessory detail with reference to the sacri fice and it forms the name of a particular sacrifice.

tadayuktam /	For these reasons, we conclude that the word citraya lays down the material for a sacrifice, just as the word vrihibhih in the sentence vrihi means bhiryajeta.
sarvathā nāmadheyapratipakṣo guvidhiḥ sa ca phalasaṃbandhe 'pyanapagataḥ /	Or, it may be that the person who holds the word Citra to lay down a material, accepts the fact of the material being with reference to the sacrifice, which fact cannot be dispensed with while the theory that the word lays down a material as leading to a particular result is open to all the objections urged in the foregoing Adhikarana.

ReplyThis does not affect the case because the Stoma being only a measure of the Eulogy, as limiting the Hymn which is the means of the Eulogy, whether the limitation be done by means of certain Rk verses, or by means of Butter, the number as the limiting agent is always called Stoma on account of its being a measure of the Eulogy, .

On the other hand, if the word Oitrayā be taken as the name of a sacrifice, the sentence would only lay down a relationship between the sacrifice and a particular result and there would be no room for any of the aforesaid objections. In the case of the expression pancadaçājyāni, the particular material Butter, as also the number Fifteen, not being found to be in any way.

tathā pa śvadaśānyājyānītyatrāstirbhavantipara iti sattopakalpanaṃ prayogavacanācca vidhiḥ /	That it is not possible for the sentence to be taken as an Injunc tion of the Material as qualified by the particular number, we shall show later on under the Sutra IVi.

Nor is it possible for these fifteen butters to form the object of the sentence that lays down the recitation of the Hymns because they have not the character of an Action or Verb.
nahi stoma iti stotrīyasaṃkhyāto 'nyā vidhīyate / A prathamādhyāyasya caturthaḥ pāda /	As has been well said The principal Action or Verb cannot take in any accessories or Materials as constituting its procedure, unless there is an intermediate action, as sumed in accordance with the sentence.

Nor is the existence of Butter, &c., such as is not fully established in the world and as such their existence can never be taken as the object of a Bhavana such as one should think of establishing the existence of Butter, &c., &c.. It may be urged that there may be a Bhavana of placing the Butter, &c., in proximity to the Hymn which proximity is not an estab lished fact.
na cātra matvarthalakṣaṇā /	But this too is not possible because no such proximity forms the object of any Injunction.
arthādane kamapyarthaṃ vidhāpayati bhāvanā/ viśeṣaṇa vidhistvanyanna gṛhṇāti viśeṣaṇam	In the case of the sentence having laid the fire, &c.,the proximity of the fire to the Hymning is distinctly enjoined by the sentence itself when this action of the laying of fire being apart from the action of mere existing of the fire, is capable of being taken as constituting a part of the procedure.
utpattiva/kyavijñātaṃ karma sarvaṃ hyanūdyate / na cāśritaguṇe śakyaṃ tadvirodhi guṇāntaram	In accordance with Siddhanta theory the sentence being found to serve a distinctly useful purpose, there is no apparent Inconsistency that would necessitate the assumption of any sentence laying down the relationship of the Ajya with the Hymn.
prathamaṃ hi svavākyasthairguṇaiḥ saṃbadhyate kriyā / vākyāntaragataiḥ paścānna śuddā sā hyavāpyate	If the expression pancadaçãnyājyāni were to lay down the number fifteen with reference to the Butter laid down in the sentenceājyaih stuvate, then, as shown in the foregoing Adhikarana, there would be a necessity of having recourse to Possessive Indication and it is with a view to this that the Bhashya saysThat the Hymns and the Ajya could be laid down by the word only by means of Indication.
puruṣārtho hi sarveṇa kharasādeva kāmyate /	And further, the Butter being a substance always liable to exist in one mass, the number fifteen could not apply to it directly and hence it would be necessary to assume certain measures or weights of itsuch as the Pala and the rest, which are not mentioned in the sentence itself.
tatsādhanatadaṅgeṣu pravṛtti prārthanāhate nāvāntarakriyāyogāte vākyopakalpitāta/	The Bhashya has taken the word Ajya as a name because that is the only way in which the expression pancadaçãnyajyāniwhich is subsidiary to the sentence ajyaih stuvatēcan be explained and the reasons why this interpretation has been accepted are because in this manner alone can the two words pancadaçani and ajyani be construed together and because of the meanings of the component parts of the word, as pointed out in the Veda, both by way of explanatory sen tences, and by that of Arthavādas.
guṇadravye kathaṃbhāvairgṛhṇanti prakṛtāḥ kriyāḥ	That is to say, the explanation of the name Ajya, as belonging to the Hymns, is supplied by the Veda itself As the gods went to battle with these, they are Ajya that is to say, because the gods, according to the advice of Prajapati, went to battle, after having recited these Hymns, therefore they came to be known as Ajya, as fitting the gods for battle aji.
guṇavākyopapattyarthaṃ samabhivyāhatena ca /	The Bhashya, however, retorts But the two wordspancadaçãni and ājyāni”would supply the qualified denotation and this refers to the fact of these two words being connected with the verb to be.
anvākhyānārthavādācca nāmadheyatvamāśritam	That the word is an injunctive one has been often repeated but all that is meant by this is that it serves to point out that which is the object of an Injunction because a word that is a name has no injunctive force.
tatprakhyaṃ cānyaśāstram	Sutra . There are other sentences mentioning the acces sories.
nanu sarvatra dviprakārameva nāmapadaṃ sāṃvijñāyika yaugikaṃ cobhayamapi cādhikaraṇaiyena pratipāditaṃ, kimidānīmavaśiṣyate yena punarvicāryate /	Objection All names are of two kindsconventional and literal and as the names of both these kinds having been dealt with in the foregoing two Adhikaraṇas what is left there that we proceed to consider now? Reply with regard to the literal names, it has been said above that they must be taken as names, because otherwise, it becomes necessary to have recourse to Possessive Indication and hence the present Adhikarana is taken up, in connection with such literal names as are capable of being taken as laying down the accessories of sacrifices, without having recourse to Possessive Indication.

In the case of the word Agnihotra the Siddhānti also explains the compound as that wherein the offering is made to Agni, and the sense of no other compound being cognised we can very easily take the SA compound as a Bahuvrihi, containing within itself a possessive implica tion the compound being explained as that Deity Fire to whom the offering is made, and thereby the word can very easily be taken as laying down an accessoryDeityof the particular sacrifice.

And though it is true that the Deity Fire is distinctly mentioned in connec tion with the Evening Libation of the Agnihotra, yet we could take the word Agnihotra either as laying down the Deity for the Morning Libation apart from the Evening Libation, or as laying it down in connection with Homa in general, and as such with particular reference to the DarviHoma, &c., which have no Deities mentioned with them selves specially as such is the force of the word juhoti in the sentence. speaking of the various Homas.
tathā ''ghāyaṃtaityāghāra iti vāraṇasamarthaṃ dravyamājyapayaḥprabhṛtyabhidhīyate /	and as such the word aghara denotes all objects capable of being poured out, such as Butter, Milk and the like.
dharmamātraṃ cāsya śaraṇaṃ śabdārtha mātrāpavargitvānnāśeṣacāraṇaṃ karoti / tatvāritaikadeśena kiṃ kartavyamityastyapeśā lokepi ca dravadravyāṇāṃ ka citpānādāvupayocyamāṇānāmīṣatścāraṇa saṃskāraṃ kurvanti /	And in the sentenceāghāramāghārayati we find the word agharam in the Accusative and as such pointing out the aforesaid Butter, &c., undergoing a certain preparation by being poured out and as there can be no such prepara tion without a definite purpose, we naturally seek for such a purpose. And then, all that is meant by the substances being poured out is that they are rendered capable of being poured out, and not that they are all poured out, because the function of the word aghara rests only in the mere signification of the word, and not in the actual carrying of it into practice and hence there is a desire to know what is to be done with the substance of which by way of testing a portion has been poured out.
tenābhiṣavayuktapūtokavadbhakṣaṇayuktaphala camamavacca saṃskāyeṃ dravyaṃ karmamātrābhilāṣi /	Thus then, the prepared or purified substance, being exactly like the extracted juice of the Putika a sub stitute for Soma or the Phalacamasa prepared for food, stands in need of an Action that would be performed with it and as such it connects itself with the Primary sacrifices of the DarçaPurnamāsa.
tatrāpi cāgneyādīnāṃ vicitadravyakatvādupagyājaḥ kevalaḥ sākāṅkṣa iti tādarthaṃ pratipadyate /	But from among these, there are some, such as the Agneya, &c., that have their own particular materials distinctly laid down and hence it is only the Upançu sacrifice that stands in need of the mention of a material and as such, the liquid material duly prepared, comes to be taken in connec tion with this Upānçu sacrifice.
athavā yatkaronīti pratyayārthamācaṃ sākāṅkṣatvādevopāṃśatantravārtika / yājabhāvanāmanūdyāghāradravye vākyena vidhīyamāne tatmādhyatvādeva dhātvarthaḥ prāpto 'nudyate /	As has been well said A sub stance, which has been mentioned in connection with a certain pro cess of purification, though not related to the Principal sacrifices comes to be taken along with other sacrifices mentioned in the same context for otherwise, it would be incapable of any purifica tion. Or, it may be that it is the denotation of the affix only that is to say, the mere factor does which is denoted by the tip affix in agharayati that constitutes the Bhavana of the Upançu sacrificewhich alone stands in need of the mention of a material, with reference to which the substance aghāra having been laid down by the sentence in ques tion, the meaning of the Verbal root in aghara comes to be taken as mentioned only as the object of the aforesaid active affix.
śrāvaprāptyaiva vā tasya kṣaraṇātmakatve vijñāte kṣaraṇamamarthamātrapayaḥprabhṛtividhiṃ manyate /	Or, it may be that by the mere fact of the Dhrauvāj ya having been found to be men tioned, points to the liquid character of the material and hence the sentence comes to be taken as the injunction of all that is capable of being poured out,for instance, such liquids as Milk, Butter and the like.
na ca dhātvathāṃdeva siddhenamnā prayojanam / na ca saṃskārakarmāṇi ka ci nnāmavanti dṛśyante / śrutyaiva guṇo vidhīyataiti dvitīyāśrutyaiva saṃskāryatvādavagyaṃ ka cidasya guṇatvamityavagamābhiprāyam /	And thus all that we want being accomplished by the direct denotation of the verbal root itself, what is the use of taking the word aghāra as a name? Nor do we ever find any merely purificatory action to have particular names. To the above, we make the following reply Inasmuch as in the case in question, we find another sentence laying down the accessories of the sacrifice, any pointing out of it by the word in question would be absolutely useless and hence we cannot but take it to be a name. Against this the following argument may be urged If one took the word Agnihotra to lay down a Deity for the Evening Homa, and Aghara to lay down a material for the Upançu for which the acces sories are distinctly mentioned, then alone could the laying down of the accessory by the word Agnihotra or Aghara be said to be use no less, on account of the material being directly enjoined in the sentence Le Se C dealing with the Evening Libation, &c.
atrocyate	As a matter of fact, however, we take the word Agnihotra as laying down the Deity for a sacrifice which has no Deity mentioned in connection with it, and the word Aghara as laying down the material for the Upancu sacrifice, for which other material has been mentioned and as such how can the other.
atra vadāmaḥ yadā tvadevate home devatāvidhirucyate / dravyaṃ copāṃśuyājamya tadā tatprakhyatā katham vidhiśvedagnihotraṃ syāttato'mya viṣayaiṣiṇaḥ / niveśaḥ prakṛte vā syādyukteraprakṛte 'pi vā	sentences be said to have laid down the Deity and the Material held to be laid down by the words Agnihotra and Aghara ? To this we make the following reply If the word Agnihotra were an Injunction, it would stand in need of an object for itself and the ques tion would be whether this object would be included in the subject of the context, or would there be reasons for transferring it elsewhere? The rela tionship of Agni with the hotra or Homa having been established by other means such as the Indication of the Mantra Agnirjyotirjyotih, &c., and in accordance with this people being found to take up the performance of the Agnihotra, the word Agnihotra distinctly comes to be merely descrip tive of a sacrifice laid down elsewhere.
anū cāpi dhātvarthaṃ guṇaḥ sarvo vidhīyate / na cānuvādaḥ prakṛtātkarmaṇo prakṛtaṃ cedanūdyāyaṃ guṇo home vidhīyate / tatra tatprakhyatā'nyatra na vidhistatparigrahāt	It is a general rule that all accessories are laid down in connection with that which is denoted by the Verbal root in the sentence and Description too is never found to belong other action save that which forms the subject of the Context. down the accessory Deity in connection with the Homa that forms the sub ject of the Context, then such an accessory could not but be accepted as having been pointed out by another direct assertion of the Vedathat speaking of the Evening Libation of the Agnihotra inasmuch as it is the Agnihotra as a whole that forms the subject of the Context, and this latter sentence distinctly mentions Agni as its Deity and hence the word Agnihotra cannot be taken as enjoining the Deity, because such a Deity has already been pointed out elsewhere.
na caturthīsamāsasya lakṣaṇaṃ cātra vidyate /	And further, in the case in question, there can be no description of that which is signified by the verbal root because it cannot be spoken of as that this forms the subject of the Context or that it does not.
athaiṣa jyotirityādivarjamudāharaṇam /	Conse quently the sentence agnihotram juhoti must be taken as laying down a particular action or Homa named Agnihotra.
vatyarthopādānena karmaṇi pravṛttau cātyantaviprakṛṣṭā gauṇatā syāt /	As for the accessories of this Action, they are laid down in the passages dealing with the Evening Libation, and that containing the word urdhva hence any such action as the pure Agnihotra, i.e.
kiṃ ca	without any, Deity, &c.
ātmoccāraṇakāle tu svārthameva viniyuko / bhavatastu yenārthānapayogādādita eva sāhagyavivaścayā padaṃ pravṛttamityupagamāt śrutibādhaprasaṅgaḥ /	not being found to be directly mentioned in the Veda, it cannot be taken as the subject of the Context. Nor can the word be taken s being descriptive of that which is not in close proximity to it, because there are many intervening obstacles and as such it is as incapable of entering our minds as any stray action, like the Kaundapãyina Homa. If it be held that, the word might be taken as enjoining the Homa as qualified by the Deity Agni,then, we reply that this could be possible only if the accessories were not laid down by other sentences as a matter of fact, however, we actually find them laid down by other sentences and hence we cannot accept the explanation suggested.
śyenādivākyeṣu hi yathā vai śyeno nipatyādattaevamayamapītyupagamānna stutirdṛśyate /	And again, though the Deity Fire is known from the sentence mentioning the Evening Libation only in connection with one part of the Agnihotra, yet this cannot remove the fact of the word Agnihotra being a name descriptive of the facts already got at from the other sentence dealing with its various parts.
guṇavidhāne ca prayenadravyaṃ vidhīyataiti tadeva stotavyam /	And though the meaning of the verbal root juhoti, &c. can be taken only in the character of the Instrument, yet the words Agnihotram and Agharam in the Accusative could be taken along with that factor of the Aetion which is yet to be accomplished.

tenodbhidā yāgaṃ yāgena ca paśṭhan bhāvayediti yugapadvidhivyāpārādvinaiva matvarthacakṣaṇayā saṃbandhasiddhiḥ /	For instance, in the case of the sentence udbhida yajēta paçukamah the full signification would be that the sacrifice should be accomplished by means of the udbhid mate rial, and the acquisition of cattle should be accomplished by means of the sacrifice and thus the operation of both Injunctions going hand in hand simultaneously and thus there being no syntactical split, the full construction of the sentence is got at, without having recourse to Possessive Indication.

tatredamapi vākyaṃ śuddhaṃ bhaviṣyatīti vājapeyopanyāsaḥ / sarvāṇyeva tvihodāirtavyāni /	them as Names. The present discussion thus bears upon perhaps all such words as are taken to be names but the Bhashya cites the particular sentence Vājapêyena svārājyākāmo yajēta only, with a view that the true meaning of this sentence may also be arrived at.

There are two ways of having the Simultaneous Relationship, either by taking each word or sentence by itself, or by taking them collectively, according as what is signified by the verb occupies the secondary or the primary position in the sentence.
te guṇā copadiśyeran vidhinā hyavibhāgataḥ	And all that is done in this is to put forth more explicitly the aforesaid Simultaneous Relationship of the Sacrifice.
na dravyasya svarūpeṇa mantrākāṅkṣā 'vakalpate /	But, even in the case of an Injunction of the material, it is only a verb that can be taken as having the Injunctive character and hence, the word Vajapēya not being a verb, it cannot be accepted to be Injunc tive of the material.

yadi hi prathamaṃ yāgatvamavadhāyata tato devatākāṅkṣāyāṃ satya devatāvācino mantrāḥ saṃbadhyeran, na tu tadbhavatiśabdenoktam /	And, as a matter of fact, on the present occasion we are treating only of the words treating of the objects of Injunction, whereas in the th Adhyāya we shall treat of the words contained in Arthavada passages, such for instance as If one should perform only one sacrifice, he should perform the DarviHoma. Or, it may be that when the fact of the word DarviHoma being the name of a sacri fice has been established, it is only its peculiarities that are considered in the th Adhyāya while on the present occasion we consider only the general characteristics of names.
na ca yāgasaṃbandhātprāk puroḍāmādīnāṃ viṣvamavadhāryate /	The sacrifice cannot be taken as enjoined, by the mere mention of a certain relationship between a certain Material, a Deity and the prepara tion of these as shown in the Pūrvapaksha. Why? Because the Material Cake by itself cannot have anything to do with the Mantras the Yōjyā, &c.
saṃbandhiśabdo hyayaṃ na dravyasvarūpaprayuktaḥ /	Nor do we recognise the Material as having any connection with the words denoting something else for instance, the words of the Mantras pointing out particular Deities.
tadeva hi dravyamayāgasaṃbaddhaṃ payaḥprabhṛti na loke haviḥ śabdavācyaṃ bhavati /	And as the Material already exists, there can be no making of it by the agent, and as such even this cannot be taken as standing in need of the Mantra which would remind the Agent of it. As for the Mantras themselves agnirmürdha, &c.they do not express either the Material or its action and as such, en through this there could not be any relationship between the Mantras, and the Material specially as the Material has no connection with the words of the Mantra, that denote Agni and the rest.
etena catu ravattacodanākalpitakarmanāmatvaṃ pratyuktam /	The same arguments apply to the theory of the word agneya being a name, based upon the mention of the offering of the quartered Cake see above.

And again, there are only three ways of pointing out the Deity of a sacrifice viz by means of a nominal affix, by means of the Dative caseending and by means of certain expressive words in the Mantra and among these the one that follows is always weaker in authority than that which precedes it. And in the case in question, when we find the Deity being distinctly pointed out by the nominal affix in the word agneya which is the most authoritative way of mentioning the Deity, why should we have recourse to the least authoritative method, holding the Deity to be pointed out by the words in the Mantras the Yajya, &c.
nupapattimūlaścāsau na ca taddhite saṃbhavatyanyathānupapattiḥ /	? specially as it is only an Apparent Inconsistency that can justify our hav ing recourse to this method of arriving at the Deity but when we find the Deity actually pointed out by the nominal affix, and there is no inconsis tency, any recourse to it is most unjustifiable.
tasmādanenaiva kṛte dravyadevatāsaṃvandhe 'rthavādapuraḥsareṇa bhavatiśabdena vihite viśeṣārthaṃ krameṇa mantrāmnānam /	Thus then, we conclude that the relationship between the Material Cake and the Deity Agni is pointed out by the word agneya, and the sacrifice comes to be enjoined by means of the word bhavati, as aided by this word and certain Arthavāda passages eulogising the offering of the cake as prepared in the eight vessels and then it is that, there being a further desire to learn the details of the sacrifice, the Veda lays down the Mantras the Yajyā, &c.
agatyā cānekārthavidhiraṅgīkriyate/	in a certain order of sequence.
vidhānārthe tadvitānte śabda iti vidhiprayojanatvābhiprāyeṇa /	The word Vidhanarthe in the Sūtra has been explained in the Bhā shya as in the word with the nominal affix and the sense of this is that the word with the nominal affix is capable of serving the purposes of an Injunc tion.

tataśca tadvitāntapadopāttavidhinā sarvamanyadarthādātipyamāṇaṃ na vākyaṃ bhinatti /	Thus then, the chief Injunction being contained in the word with the Nominal affix, and all other attendant accessories also being indicated by it, there is no occasion for any syntactical split.

The word avibhāgāt meansinasmuch as the word implies all the factors enumerated above and the qualifying sentence if they are not laid down by any other word points to the fact of Apparent Inconsistency being the only ground of accepting the Injunction of the various factors of the relationship.

That is to say, at the time that we come across the Injunction of the cutting of the wood for the post, or of the fastening of the animal to the post, if we had any idea of any meaning of the word post, as known in ordinary parlance, then we could never have any necessity of subvert ing the natural order of wordsin the Injunction the post should be cutand construing it as that which is cut is the post in which case the post which is the subject in the original sentence is made the predicate, and vice versa.

In this case, the word is found to be used in a sentence where it cannot have the meaning that is expressed by it literally and hence from the Apparent Inconsistency of its such usage, we are obliged to assume conventionally another expressive potency for it.
va budhyante samudāyaprasiddhiṣu / arthabhāgopasaṃhārāditarā viprakṛṣyate	And it is to this form of the direction that an objection is raised Even though the word may refer to a purified material, yet, from the particular gender, &c., of the word prokshanih it is clear that it refers to the water apah and hence the presence of the feminine sign i would set aside the possibility of Butter being brought in.
asatkhavayavārtheṣu yo 'nyatrārthe prayujyate / tatrānanyagatitvena samudāyaḥ prasidhyati	When, however, the word is held to have a literal meaning, even before the addi tion of the feminine ending, the literal meaning of the word is recognised to be the same washing material and hence when the particular washing material meant is the Butter, the feminine ending is not added, the noun by itself is simply used the direction being simply ‘prokshaṇamāsādaya ”.
bhavetāṃ yadi vṛkṣeṣu vājikarṇo kathaṃ cana / adṛṣṭāṃ samudāyasya kaḥ śakti jātu kalpayet	And though in a case when Injunctions refer to the verbal form of a word, no changes in it are allowable, yet there can be no such restriction of words in the case in question because the direction refers to materials, and not to their names and hence it is by no means possible that the word prokshani, in the said direction being incapable of being changed into prokshana, the word to be used must be ghrta only, as in the case of the words that have their significations conventionally fixed to the class of objects.
tathā nirmanthye	Sutra So also in the case of the word nirmanthya.
nirmanthye 'pi pūrvādhikaraṇavajjātisaṃskāranimittapaścāvaḍāvyānantareṇa yaugikatvaṃ sādhanīyam	P In the case of the word Nirmanthya =the fire produced by fric. tion also, we can as before raise questions as to its signifying the class or a purified fire, and then we should set aside these names and finally prove that it must be taken in its literal signification.

In ordinary parlanceas for instance in the case of the sentence Navanītēna bhunkte cited in the Bhashyathe signi fication of words being based upon the purposes that they serve, even though the word Nāvanītēna itself does not necessarily denote the fact of the freshboiled butter being meant, yet by the fact of the word ghrta alone being generally used in the sense of the ordinary butter, the special use of the word Navanītēna may be taken as indicating the freshlyboiled butter because all butter being boiled out of cream nāvani tēna, the repetition of the word nāvanītēna can be taken to signify the fact of the freshlyboiled butter being meant to be eaten.

For certainly, this immediateness does not form part of the literal signification of the word, which rests only in the fact of the fire being produced by the particular process of friction. But the above arguments do not affect our position because the presence of the Fire itself being indicated by the word paka cooking itself, the addition of the word Nirmanthya must be taken as with the sole view to lay down the particular qualification of the Fire that is meant and this qualification of being produced by friction forming part of the aforesaid cooking could not but be brought about at the very place where the cooking is to be done.

Or, it may be that in the case of such words as Nirmanthya and the like, it has been found that the names that have literal meanings signify something not got at before and as such are found to serve the purpose of Injunctions and the question very naturally followswhether or not the same may be said of the word Vaiçvadēva also. The Purvapaksha says there is an option but this is only an ex planation of what follows if the word is takenļas laying down an Accessory i.e., in that case, inasmuch as there are other Deities laid down by other passages, there would be an option among the Deities to whom the sacri fice in question could be offered.
aṅgānāṃ ca pradhānenaikadeśakāla kartṛtvaṃ va cyate /	There could be an option in making the offering to the Vigvēdevas, or to the Deity pointed out in the original Injunction.

viśvedevā na ca prāptāḥ pratyekaṃ saṃhateṣu vā	Nor are the Vaiçvēdēvas known prior to the sen tence in question to belong either to one of these sacrifices or to all of them taken collectively and as such the word could not be taken as referring to these sacrifices.
prakṛtatvāviśeṣe 'pi yatra prāptirna vidyate /	Sutra . But it is not so because of the Context, and be cause of there being a direct Injunction specially as the Context does not apply to the material.

guṇāntarāvaruddhatvānnāvakāśo guṇo 'paraḥ /	But it is not so, because the relationship of the material Ashtakapāla with the Deity Agni having been establish ed by the nominal affix in ‘agnēya, all that the sentence does is to point out the fact of agneya qualifying the ashtakapāla.
vikalpo 'pi na vaiṣamyāttasmānnāmaiva yujyate	and that as there could be no sacrifice without a material, the only material that could be made to reach the Viçvēdēvas by means of this sentence alone would be that which is indicated by the apparent inconsistency of the sacrifice.

vaiśvadevamupādāya devatā nopadiśyate / saha vidhyanuvāda/ hi naikaḥ śabdaḥ samaśnute	The word Vaiçvadēva cannot be taken as laying down the Deity for the sacrifices of which the Vaiçvadēva is one because in that case the same word Vaiçvadēva would be taken, once in connection with the Āmikshā sacrifice as only pointing to a wellestablished fact, and at the same time as an Injunction of the Deity, with reference to the other seven sacrifices and certainly this is highly improper.
parārthatvād guṇānām	Because the Accessories have a secondary impor tance lit., are for the sake of others.
pūrveṇaikasūtramapi sambhavati / mithaḥ saha pradāne kriyamāṇe triṃśatsaṃpattyabhāvāda nartha sambandhaḥ syāt /	This Sutra may be taken as a part of the previous Sutra, the two to gether being explained in the following manner If all the materials be offered together, there could not be thirty offerings in all and this would con stitute a sin Sūtra because the material offered is an accessory Sūtra and as such the material being of secondary importance, a mere difference in these materials as amiksha, vajina and the other materials offered at offering because if the word Vaiçvadeva be taken as laying down a common Deity for all these sacrifices the Deity of all the offerings being one and the same, it would certainly be a very much simpler process to make a single offering of all the materials and thus there being a pos sibility of making a single offering of all the materials, no repetition of the action of offering can be allowable.
kutaḥ	Sutra .
tena sakṛttyāgaḥ karttavya iti satyāṃ sahapradānaśaktau nāvattiryuktā ktā /	Those words that express something already known before, cannot serve the purposes of an Injunction. The aforesaid is also applicable to the sentence in question. The consideration of the question as to whether certain words are names of sacrifices or Injunctions of Accessories having been finished, we now proceed to consider whether certain words can be taken as Injunctions of Accessories.
saṃpratipannadevatātvācca sahapradānamaviruddhaṃ śakyaṃ ka prathamādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	When a word expresses a meaning that is already known, then it is either a name or an Arthavāda in the case in question however, as the word signifies something not known before it cannot but be taken as laying down an accessory, a particular number of the cakes and as such there would be an option as to the number, exactly as there was in the case of the word Vaiçvadeva.
triṃśatpūraṇaṃ ca keṣāṃ cidevaṃ, nava prayājāḥ, navānuyājāḥ, dvāvāghārau, dvāvājyabhāgau, aṣṭau pradhānājataya iti / apareṣāṃ tu sviṣṭakṛdājinejyāgrahaṇādāghārau na gaṇitau/	That is to say, if the number eight be somehow or other, already known to belong to the cakes employed at the Vaiçvānara sacrifice, then, in accordance with this wellknown fact, the word Ashtakapāla would be taken either as a name or as an Arthavada as a matter of fact, however, we do not find the number eight mentioned anywhere else, in con nection with the Vaiçvanara sacrifice as the only number that is men tioned is twelve. S And as a matter of fact, though the smaller number eight is included in the greater number twelve, yet when the word used is twelve, it does not signify the fact of the number eight specifying the object and as such this latter number cannot be taken as qualifying the object in question. That is to say, a number does not operate by its mere presence but the only operation that it has is through the specification of the numbered object and hence, when the cups have been specified by the number twelve, any other number, eight, f.
sarvathā tu pradhānācutibhedadarśanasiddhiḥ	IIi and these too are possible only when the factors of the word have the requisite capability this requisite capability again is possible, only when they are independent of all extraneous help.
pūrvajñātārthavācitve nāmadheyārthavādane / aprāptatvādicaite syurvaiśvadevavikalpavat	Consequently, in the case in question, if the number eight be dependent upon the num ber twelve, we could not have the word ashtākapāla as in that case neither the particular nominal affix nor the compound would be possible and hence the word ashtakapāla cannot be accepted to be significant of the Dvadaçakapāla.
yadyapyarthātmanāstyeva mahāsaṃkhyāsvavāntarā/	And the num ber twelve has a distinct praise of itself in the Vedic sentence jagatyaivāsmin, &c.
aparicchedakatvāttu nāsau karmaviśeṣaṇam guṇasya tu vidhānārthe 'taguṇāḥ prayoge syuranarthakā nahi taṃ pratyarthaprathamādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	and as such it does not stand in need of any other praise. For these reasons, we conclude that the word ashtakapāla must be taken as laying down the number eight as an optional alternative to the number twelve. And inasmuch as all the sentences in question are found to end in a single original Injunction of the Vaiçvanara sacrifice as qualified by many optional alternatives with regard to the number of cups to be employed in the preparation of the cakes to be offered, there can be no difference of authority among the various sentences forming this original Injunc tion.

tasmādavayavadāraṃ dvādaśatvaṃ prarocyate	with the Vaiçvanara sacrifice would be impossible in face of that of the number twelve. And hence the Vaiçvanara sacrifice having its particular number fixed at twelve, could not stand in need of any other number, eight, &c.
yathaiva keṣāṃ cihnidhyaddeśamātreṇa pravṛttau siddhyantyāmanyārthā stutirāśrīyate tathaivālpastutyupapanne'pi kārye mahāstutyāśrayaṇamiti	And thus not being a qualification of the Vaiçvānara sacrifice atad gunah, and being related to the Cake only apart from any sacrifice, the numbers eight, &c., would be absolutely useless, in the performance of any sacrifice prayōgē syuranarthakāh because they can have no use with regard to the Cake na hi tampratyarthavattāsti.

Sutras If it be urged that, the mention of the numbers eight, &c.

For, as a matter of fact, that alone can be praised which is recognised as enjoined in the case in question, it is the number twelve that is en joined and hence we must take the eulogistic sentences as, in some way or other, praising this number.
tathā hi	And as the number eight happens to be.
puruṣārthasiddhyartho hi sarvaḥ prayāsa iti tatpratyāsannaṃ vastu balīyo bhavati /	mentioned in close proximity to it, we can very rightly take it as only pointing out a part of the number twelve and it is a recognised fact that a praise of the part reverts to the whole.

It has been urged above that any Injunction or Praise of the number eight would be absolutely useless, as the number pertaining to the only sacrifice in question has already been laid down as twelve.

Because that which is performed with a view to a certain desirable result, being closely connected with mans true purpose, always sets aside that which is performed as a mere duty and because the “latter duty is laid down as a general rule, while the former is a special case and a special case always sets aside the general.
gāyavyaivaitamityādistateḥ prātyātmiko vidhiḥ /	Sutra . Reply On account of uselessness they cannot be instigators because the instigator is of the agent hence they must be taken as signifying mere Praise.
yadaṣṭākapāla ityādibhiḥ sārthavādakaḥ pratyekaṃ vihitānāṃ yathāsaṃkhyena pūta evetyādibhiḥ phalasaṃbandhaḥ kriyate	If distinct results be assumed to follow from each of the accessories that is if each of the numbers, eight, &c., be held to bring about a dis tinct result, then it would be necessary to have as many Injunctive Sentences as there e are results mentioned while in the case in question, Egy it is clear that the whole thing refers to a single Injunction inasmuch as it is distinctly perceptible that, from beginning to end, all that is men tioned, is in direct connection with the same subject.

Nor is the mention of the results entirely irrelevant, in connection with the Vuiçvanara sacrifice and hence there can be no ground for transferring their relationship from this to the Ashtakapāla, &c.

And though they may be taken as results following from the Vaiçvānara sacrifice, yet in the first instance, a men tion of these must be taken to be in praise of the sacrifice specially as the expression having such and such a desire does not appear in the sentences, they have not the form of the Injunctions of Results.
evaṃ kāmakārarahitatvena phalavidhyasarūpatvāt /	And hence we conclude that the words Ashtakapāla, &c., cannot be taken as laying down the accessory of a sacrifice in the shape of the number of the cups to be employed in the preparation of the cakes to be offered at it. Sutras The fulfilment of the signification Origin Similarity of shape Praise Large number the Inherence of signs ,which form the bases of secon dary or indirect significationare based upon qualities.

While what we are going to explain here is the definition or characteristic of all secondary significations of words.
vanhitvalakṣitādarthādyatyaiṅgalyādi gamyate / tena māṇavake buddhiḥ sādṛṇyādupajāyate	Some people reply to this by the assertion that all these are included in the similarity of signs Sutra because the signification of the lancer by the word lance is of the same nature as that of persons with out umbrellas by the word Chatri when they are accompanied by some persons with umbrellas.

Certainly, there is because when a word signifies something, not entirely disconnected from that which is the directly expressed meaning, then we have what is called Indication whereas when the word signifies something even though it be in no way connected with the expressed mean ing, through the similarity of the qualities indicated by the expressed meaning of the word, then this signification is called Gauna or Secondary. Thus then, just as the word, directly expressing the Class, indicates the Individual which is always present in the Class, in the same manner, it is by mere Indication, that the words lance, elevated shed and horse signify the persons connected with them.
tatrābhidhīyate	And it is not this sort of signification that we are dealing with.

sāmānyavācitā cākṛtyadhikaraṇasiddhā bādhyate / tantravārtike / kriyāguṇānāṃ cānantyānna śakyaḥ prativyakti sambandho 'nubhavitum	And these significations of the words are based upon the qualities possessed by the objects denoted by them. The Bhashya puts the question How can a word, not expressive of qualities, denote qualities? And this question is based upon the miscon ception that the words are directly expressive of the qualities however, what we actually hold is that all the significations of a word are some how or other connected with its direct denotation and hence so long as we can keep on the track of the original denotation, we can have no ground for assuming any other denotative potentiality in the word.
na cāsāmānyāt sāmānyaṃ śakyate kalpayituṃ jātyantare 'pi va citkāsāṃ citmadbhāvāt	If the word denoted such an aggregate, it could never directly denote any one part of this aggregate as for instance, the word hundred does not directly denote the number fifty while, as a matter of fact, we find the word lion being used, when the only idea in the mind is that of the Class wholly devoid of the idea of any Actions or Qualities.
na hyanabhihitaṃ siṃhatvaṃ guṇakriyāṇāṃ vyavacchedakaraṃ bhavati apratīteḥ/ abhihitaṃ cettu pratyayādevāśeṣaguṇakriyāvagamādabhi dhānaśaktyanavasāya iti samudāyavācināmekadeśeṣu na gauṇatvasambhavaḥ /	Nor could the fact of certain qualities and actions being possessed in common by certain individuals justify the assumption of these belonging to a certain Class because there are many qualities and actions that may be common among various Classes. S Thus then, we must conclude that it is only the Class Lion that could differentiate the lions from all other animals and it could not rightly serve as such a differentiator, if it were not denoted by the word • lion and if the class be admitted to be denoted by the word, then it cannot be accepted as denoting anything else. That is to say, unless the Class lion be denoted by the word lion it would be itself uncognised and as such it could not serve to differentiate the qualities and actions possessed by lions and if it be admitted to be denoted, then the idea of the Class being enough to give us an idea of all Actions and Qualities, there would be no need of assuming any other denotative potency of the word ..
kaścitpunarāha samāropitatadbhāvo gauṇa iti /	lion, with reference to these Actions, &c..
tasyaitamataṃ na kathaṃ cana paraśabdastayā jātyā khanibandhanabhūtayā vi nātyantāna bhidheya kriyāguṇamātradvāreṇānyatra varttitumarhati / na ca siṃhaśabdenā pravarttamānena siṃho devadatta iti sāmānādhikaraṇyaprayogo ghaṭate /	And for these reasons, we conclude that if the words were significant of an aggregate of such qualities, actions, &c., they could not, even indirectly, be any one portion of this aggregate. The sense of this theory is that a word lion being strictly denotative of a particular class cannot be applied to another object Dēvadatta, merely through the presence therein of certain actions and qualities belonging applicable to Devadatta, we could not have any such sentence as that Devadatta is a lion, which expresses a distinct coextensiveness between the lion and Devadatta and the only explanation of the way in which the word could be applicable to Devadatta, lies in the fact that at times, a certain word imposes the nature of its own denotations upon another object and thereby making this latter object denotable by itself, becomes applicable to it.
siṃdādi sadṛśa kriyāguṇadarśanena hi devadattādayaḥ sāmayaparikalpanayā sārūpyamāpadyante /	That is to say, the actions and qualities of Devadatta being found to be similar to those of the lion, the complete nature of the lion is imposed upon him and he comes to be recognised as identical with the lion and as such the word lion, when applied to him, does not signify anything other than the lion, which forms its own original denotation.
tataśca svārthaeva śabdaḥ prayujyate na caitāvatā mukhyaprasaṅgo 'rthasyādhyāropitatvāt /	But this does not mean that Dēvadatta is denoted by the word lion directly because, after all, the character of the lion is only imposed upon him and it is only when the denotation is directly of the word itself, and there is no imposition, that it can be called a direct denotation.
yatra tu sa evārtho na samāropyate tatra mukhya ityadoṣaḥ / tatredamucyate naitatkalpanāyā aśakyatvāt / tathā hi	And hence our theory is not open to any objection. In regard to this theory, we make the following remarks This cannot be, because any such imposition is absolutely impossible for all objects having unique unmixed characters of their own, the character of one object could not be imposed upon another, for the purposes of denotation, by any persons not labouring under a gross delusion.
yadā tāvaḍbhāntyā mṛgatṛṣṇāyāṃ toyamadhyāropya śabdaṃ prayaṅkte, tadobhayoḥ mukhyārthādhyavasānarūpeṇa toyapratītarbhrānti mukhyatvam / athāpi vaktā vivekī sannitaravacanārthaṃ prayukta, śrotā ca na viviṅakta, tadāpye kasya vivekenādhyāropābhāvāditarasya a ntyādhyavamānānnaikamapi prati gauṇatvopapattiḥ / yadā tu dvāvaṣyabhrāntau tadobhayoḥ sādṛśyādinimittānta tavatyarthādhyavasānādāropābhāvaḥ /	For instance, when a person, under a delusion, imposes the charac ter of Water upon the Mirage, and speaks of it as water, then in that case both the speaker and the person addressed comprehend the word water in its direct denotation though under the spell of the delusion and in this case the delusory denotation is none other than the direct one and there is no imposition In a case where the speaker knows the Mirage to be a Mirage and not Water, and still he speaks of it as water, with a view to delude the person addressed, who does not know that it is not water, then in the case of the former, inasmuch as he knows that it is not mirage, there can be no imposition of the character of Water upon the mirage while in the case of the latter, what he comprehends under the delusion is, for him, the Water itself and as such, even in his case there is no indirect application of the word water, and hence there can be no Imposition in this case either In a case where none of the two is under a delusion both knowing the Mirage to be something other than Water, the comprehension that they have is one of mere similarity and no Iden tity, and hence in this case too there can be no Imposition. So also in the case of the sentence Devadatta is a lion, both the speaker and the person addressed are fully cognisant of the difference between the man and the lion and hence none of them can have the power to impose the character or identity of the one upon the other.
yathaitra hyasadṛśānāmarthānāṃ tiktamadhurādīnāṃ na kathaṃ cidapi pratītyabhāvātparaparādhyāropaṇa, mevaṃ sahaśanāmapi vivekajñānaṃ nopapadyate / na hyarthādhyavasānādanyādṛśaṃ nāmajñānaṃ vyavahārāṅgaṃ bhavatīti / kiṃ ca	the case of the different kinds of tasteBitter, Sweet, etc.,that are known to be different from one another, it never happens that any two of them being recognised to be identical, the character of the one is imposed upon the other exactly in the same manner, among similar objects also, inas much as they are always recognised to be different from another, there could be no imposition and certainly in the case of words, there is no cognition that is of any use in its usage, save that of its meaning. And further, inasmuch as no word is ever used, unless there is a basis for its usage, how could there be any idea, by itself, independently of the object. That is to say the class Lion is the only basis for the use of the word lion and this class does not pertain to Dēvadatta hence in regard to Devadatta how could one have any idea of the lion? Any such idea would be absolutely baseless.
na cārtharahitā buddhirātmākāramātramanubhavantī jāyate ityuktaṃ śūnyavāde /	And that apart from the object, there is no Idea indepen dently pertaining to itself, we have already shown in the chapter on Çünyavāda vide Çlokavārtika in loco.

That is to say, in all cases, the differentiation of significations into direct and indirect serves a useful purpose, only in the help that it affords the person addressed to ascertain the true signification of the word in any sentence and it does not suit any purpose of the speaker. And as soon as the word lion has been uttered, the persons addressed directly compre hend it, as not having its denotation imposed upon any other object and then it is that, finding this direct denotation to be incompatible with its avowed coextensiveness with Devadatta, they conclude to take the word lion in its indirect or figurative sense.
tatmādṛśyādipratītirbhavati /	And in this it is clear that the persons addressed comprehend this figurative meaning only through similarity, without having themselves imposed the character of the lion upon Dovadatta.
sā ca kiṃ śabdādathārthādityanvicchatāmanvayavyatirekābhyāmākṛtyadhikaraṇanyāye nārthāditi nistrayo jāyate /	And when we proceed to consider whether this comprehension pro ceeds from the word, or from its denotation, it becomes clear, through negative and positive concomitance, as also through the conclusion arrived at in the Adhikarana on Class, that it proceeds from the denotation.
yadā ca śrotṛṇāṃ svayamadhyāropābhāvaḥ, tadā vaktaryyapi naivaiṣāmevaṃ kalpanā bhavati, yathā nūnamanena siṃhatvamadhyāropitamiti/	Be cause even when the word lion has not been uttered, if we happen to have an idea in our mind of the animal, we at once recognise its similarity in Devadatta if we find him possessed of exceptional courage,etc. while, on the other hand, if we have no idea of the animal, even if the word lion be uttered, we could have no idea of the similarity of Dēvadatta to the lion.
na cāsya samastasya kiṃ cidekaṃ vācakaṃ padamasti tenāvinābhāvitayā kathaṃ nu siṃhatvāttatpratītirbhavediti tattāvadabhidhīyate yataḥ / sthitiyā śabdaśaktyā puṃsāṃ vyavahāro na tadaśena śaktyantaropajana iti /	And when, as a matter of fact, there is no Imposition in the minds of the persons addressed, it follows that there could be none in that of the speaker and hence when a man utters the sentence Dēvadatta is a lion the idea that the persons addressed have is, not that he has imposed the character of the lion upon Dēvadatta but the working of their minds may be explained as being somewhat to this effect What he means by the word lion here is an aggregate of certain properties and actions that are concomitant with the class lion it is for the sake of brevity that he does not mention these properties, etc., by all the words that express them individually specially as there is no single word expressive of all these and hence in order to give an idea of all these properties, he uses the word lion, because the properties he wishes to express are concomitant with the class lion which is denoted by the word lion specially as all usage among men is carried on according to the already existing significations of words and hence no usage can produce new significations of them.
tasmādguṇapravṛttiprayojano gauṇa ityeva lakṣaṇaṃ nyāyyaṃ nānyathā /	For these reasons, we conclude that the expression Gauna or Secon dary, Indirect, or Figurative Signification must be defined as that which is based upon the fact of the existence of certain properties guna in com mon between the two objects, Lion and Devadatta and there can be no other definition.
nanvevaṃ sati khapuṣpādīnāṃ svārthāvinābhūtaguṇābhāvāṅga prayo gābhāvaprasaṅgaḥ, sāṃkhyādikalpitapradhānādiniṣedhe ca bauddhāde vinādhyāropeṇa prayogāsambhavo 'nabhyupagate hi pratiṣedhānarthakyamabhyupagate tavirodhaḥ syādadhyāropitaniṣedhe tvadoṣa iti /	Objection If such be the case, then there could be no such figurative assertion as that this is a skyflower because there are no pro perties that are concomitant with the skyflower and without an Imposition, how could the Bauddha bring forward any arguments against the Sankhya theory of Pradhana being the origin of the creation? For unless he admits the existence of such a thing as Pradhana, any denial of it would be absolutely useless and if he admits of it, such denial would be a selfcontradiction and the denial could be possible only by taking the character of the cause of the world to be imposed upon the Pradhana. To this we make the folowing reply As a matter of fact it is to your own theory that the above objections are applicable.
a cābhidhīyate /	with regard to which there can be any question as to whether it is im posed or not imposed.
tavaivāyaṃ doṣaḥ /	In the case of such assertions as the self is a skyflower, this theory of yours is a skyflower,where else have you perceived the class skyflower, which, like the class Lion, could be imposed upon the self, &c., as the class Lion is imposed? Hence you must admit that it is the mere form of the skyflower itself that could constitute the Imposition.
kutaḥ / adhyastekhapuṣpatvamasatkathamavastuni /	It may be askedHow can a nonentity form the object of direct denotation?? But the same question would also apply to the case of the skyflower being the object of an indirect signification.
prajñātaguṇasattākamadhyaropyeta vā na vā anyatra jñātasadbhāvaḥ padārthonyatra vāyaṃte /	as a matter of fact, that alone can be said to be the indirect meaning, upon which something else is imposed, and not that which is imposed upon another and in the case in question we find that it is the skyflower that is imposed upon the Self, &c., and as there is no other object the self being denied by the speaker, it would be imposed upon itself! To the above the following objection might be raised It is the form of such entities as the jar and the like that is imposed upon the sky flower, and as such the fact of its forming the indirect signification cannot be said to be merely an assumption.
na tvekacaiva sadrūpamamadrūpaṃ ca gamyate	But this is not quite true because in the case of the skyflower, we have no idea of any positive entity such as the form of the jar, &c..
yāṃ niṣedhāḥ kriyāmāharna yātītyevamādayaḥ /	As it has been well said that the action that is pointed out by such nega tions as he does not go, &c., is the same that is expressed in a positive form by the expression he says.
tiṣṭhatītyādibhiḥ saiva vasturūpā pratīyate	Thus then, words like hares horn, having in the abovementioned manner got at their direct denotation, come to be applied indirectly or figuratively to any other object which appears in a form other than the generally recognised one.
paramāṇu śarīrādikāraṇātmā divādibhiḥ /	That is to say, the word Pradhana pertains to the Cause of the Universe and it is such a Pradhana that is denied by the Bauddha and others, on the ground that there can be no such cause apart from such causes as Atoms as held by the Naiyāyika, or a series of Bodies, and the like as held by the Jaina that is to say, the word Pradhana denotes nothing other than these atoms, &c.
tato'nyāhaka pradhānātmarūpaṃ nāstīti varṇyate	Therefore the secondary signification of these words also are based upon their own direct meanings and as such there can be no incongruity in our theory as regards such relations.
jātiḥ /	as shown below.
tatrāgneyādiśabdānāṃ brāhmaṇādiṣu mukhatvameva yena kena cisambandhena tadvitotpādān /	The Bhashya has cited as an instance under this head, the sentence agnēyo brāhmaṇah, where the word agneya is said to be in praise of the Brahmana. But the word agnēyasignifying as it does one whose Deity is Agniis applicable to the Brahmana directly, and there need not be an indirect signification in this case because there is no doubt that the Brāhmana has some sort of relationship with Agni and this is all that is signified by the nominal affix in the word.
devatāsambandha eva vāsti na hi yadeva tyajyate tasyaiva kevalaṃ devatāsambandhaḥ, tyakturapi tenaiva sambandhena saiva devatā bhavati /	It is not necessary that it is only an offering that can be related to a Deity because the offerer of the sacri fice also has some relationship with the Deity and as such this can very well be spoken of as belonging to him as the Bhashya itself says later on The Deity belongs to the sacrificing person also.
tasmādanuḍhāharaṇatvam /	And hence this word cannot serve as the proper example in the present connection.
ato yatrāgnivai brāhmaṇa ityādiprayogāstadudāharttavyam /	Therefore we must cite as instances such assertions as The Brahmana is Agni where the word directly signifying the Fire, indirectly points to the Brahmana, through the quality of being born from Prajapatis mouth which is common to Agni and to the Brālimana.
agnirhi pratīto mukhaprabhavatvasāmānyena brāhmaṇādīnupasthāpayati / jātiriti cātra ja nmopāḍhānaṃ vivakṣitaṃ yadyapi ca tathā vastu nāsti tathāpyarthavādāntare tathoktatvādidda tacchabdanimittatā pratipatsyate	Objection Sarupya or similarity is the basis of all figurative expres sions why then should it be cited as the basis of a particular expression ? Reply True it is so but the Sārūpya or similarity meant here is that of shape, which is perceptible to the eye. For instance, the upright ness and the brightness due to the painting, belonging to the sacrificial post yupa are visible to the eye, and it is through these properties that it is eulogised by means of the words yajamāna and aditya the master of the sacrifice and the sun being both upright and bright. Because the sentence in question cannot be taken as laying down the fact of the yajamāna being utilised as the sacrificial post because in that case the yajamana being stuck up in the ground like the post and having the animal tethered to him, could not perform the duties of the yajamāna and this would be a most absurd incongruity.
praśaṃsā /	As for the Sun, it is absolutely impossible for him to be employed as the post.
nanu sarvvatra praśaṃsānimittatvaṃ guṇavādasyoktam / satyaṃ, phannamanyatra guṇavādasya praśaṃsā, atra tu guṇasārūpyādivatpravṛttini mittam /	Objection It has been shown above that all figurative expressions are based upon praise why then should it be brought in as the basis of a particular figurative expression ? Reply True but in all other cases Praise is the result of the figura tive expression, while in the sentence in question it forms its basis, just like the similarity of shape, &c. But how can it be so ? The word paçu having signified the excellence of the cow and the Horse, the negative compound apaçu indicates the absence of that ex cellence in all other animals. As a matter of fact, however, it is not that the form of the paçu animal does not belong to the buffalo, &c.
na tāvanmahiṣādīnāṃ paśutvasvarūpābhāvaḥ śakyate vaktuṃ pratyaśca virodhā, ttatkāryapratiṣedhaḥ kalpyeta tadapi tatra tatra vacanavihitatvāt na śakyameva /	Because there is a distinct difference in the authoritative character of the two de clarations as in the case of the declaration of the functions belonging to the buffalo, &c., the Injunctions already exist whereas in the case of the other declaration, the Injunction will have to be assumed. And when the use of the word nonanimal can be very easily explained as being in praise of the Cow and the Horse, there is no pressing need for assuming any such Injunction specially as in both cases the abandoning of the direct signi fication is equally necessary in the case of the Praise paçu excellent, while in the other case, itperforming the functions of the animal and further, in the case of such an assumption, the sentence paçavo goçvāh would be a useless repetition.
na ca vikalpo vaiṣamyāt /	Nor do we find any other accessory mentioned, to which the sentence in question could refer.
kalpyo hyatra vi dhiritaratra kṛptaḥ stutyā vārthavattvānnāgatyā taḍhāśrayaṇam/	To this, some people make the following reply It is the putting up that is enjoined by the sentence and the Mantra is referred to only with a view to show the great importance of the putting up, the purport of the sentence being that the putting up is so very excellent that it is done with such important Mantras.
tulyaśca mukhyārthatyāgaḥ paśavo govā iti ca punarupādānamanarthaṃkaṃ na ca paśśutvaikārthasamavāyinaḥ kriyāguṇāḥ śakyāḥ pravivektum /	Nor could the putting up be said to be of the bricks collected together because, inasmuch as the putting up is laid down with reference to the bricks, its injunction would have to be repeated with regard to each individual brick of the collection. And further, even though the putting up may be pointed out by the mention of collecting, yet it would be necessary to mention it where it has been mentioned, in order to show that the name of Adhvaryava belongs to the action which would show that the putting up of all the bricks is to be done by a single person, the Adh varyu priest. While if the putting up were left to be inferred from the mention of the collecting, there would be no such fixity as to its performer.
anyaśabdenaiva ca nāvānarthaḥ siddha ityanarthakam / avaśyaṃ cottarapadena pratiṣedhyerthe prathamamupāttena tatrānuvarttitavyaṃ viṣayaracitapratiṣedhāsambhavāt /	The Bhashya, however, only points out that the sentence could not be taken as an Injunction without taking certain words in the figurative sense which is not allowable in an Injunction, and that for this reason, it must be taken as a descriptive Arthavada. And what this means is that, in the sentence he hymns by a single hymn, yet the distinguishing word Srshti is found only among a few of them, such as the Anuvākya, &c. and hence if the word Srshti were applied to all the Mantras, it would be abandoning its direct signification, and accepting an indirect one which is not allowable in an Injunction and while indirectly indicating the Mantras not containing the word it would also denote those that do contain it and this would be a very complicated process.
na ca praśastatvādanyadupādoyamānamupayujyate /	If, however, it is taken as a mere descriptive eulogy of the putting up, any recourse to indirect or figurative expression cannot be considered undesirable.
śaknuvanti ca gavāśvādisambandhāttadūtaṃ prāśastya gamayitum / yadyapyapraśastatvamapi śaknuvanti tathāpi prakramāpeśayā tadihānākāṅkṣitamiti prāśastyameva niṣidhyate /	The Injunction and the Eulogy are always held to pertain to the same object and hence if there is any doubt with regard to one of these, the real fact is ascertained by the help of the other e.g., in the case of the Injunction the pebbles should be wetted, there arises a doubt as to the material with which the wetting is to be done and this is set aside by the concluding sentence Butter only is glory . Question What could be the ground for any such doubt? Some people hold that the ground lies in the fact of the Iujunction refering to the object Butter in its generic form.
tatpratiṣedhamānamapi ca naivopayikamiti tadvāreṇānyeṣāṃ praśastataratvaṃ ka dhyate / etaduktaṃ bhavati / gavāśvādonapekṣya naivānyasya prāśastya prathamādhyāyasya caturthaḥ pāda /	But this is not quite a correct answer because in that case the Injunction would bring about a definite idea with regard to the generic forms, and there could be no doubt. It may be asked how can there be any idea of the generic forms of objects, without any specifications ? But to this we reply that such an idea would be exactly like what we have in the case of Butter that is to say, in the case of Butter also, there may be a doubt as to whether it is fresh or stale, produced out of the milk of the cow, or from that of the buffalo and just as in this case, without any specification, we have have an idea of Butter in general, and there is no doubt in our minds, so exactly in the same manner,in the sentence the pebbles should be wetted......
vidyataityevamanyagata praśaṃsānimittaḥ pratiṣedhaḥ sā ceha prathamataramāśritetyananyaprayojanatayā paścādavagamyate /	Butter is glory itself all doubts with regard to the word butter ceases, by taking it to denote all viscous liquids that can be utilised in the wetting of the pebbles.
anyatra punaruttarakālamevaiṣā bhavantī nimittatvenocyate	With a view to these arguments others hold that the doubt arises on account of the mention, in the subsequent Arthavada of a particular material in the shape of Butter.
prāpnuvantyapi vaktavyā punarevaṃvidhā kriyā / dhvargyavasamākhyānaṃ tathā hi pratipadyate	That is to say, if the sentence were in the formthe pebbles should be wetted by butterthen there would be no room for any doubt on the other hand, if the sentence you have cited were in the form of the sentence in questionas bring the cow......the white one is excellent, then there would certainly be a ground for doubt and then this would also form a fit object of the present discussion.
tadarthamapi sambandhaḥ kāryo mantropadhānayoḥ	Hence, inasmuch as in the case of the sentence in question, the generic object is mentioned in one place, while the specific one is mentioned in another, this cannot but give rise to a doubt.
bhāṣyakāreṇa tu vidhau lacaṇāṃ pariharatānuvādatvamāśritam /	If, however, they are taken as two distinct sentences, then one being found to point out the generic object any liquid, while the other speaks of a specific object Butter, it is only natural that there should be a doubt.
ekayā stuvataiti hyanuvākādyasyaivā sṛṣṭiciṅgatvādātmaparityāgenetaralacaṇārthatā syāt, tallacayitvā ca punarātmāpi pratipādanoya ityatigauravamupadhānastutyarthatvena punaranuvādatvādaduṣṭā lakṣaṇā	Though it has been explained above that the Arthavāda forms a single sentence with the Injunction, yet this only refers to the subsequent relationship of the two, which is just like the re lationship of the Primary sentence with the Subsidiary sentences for instance, it is only after the sentences have only ended with the significa tion of their own meanings, that they are joined together into one com plete sentence, in accordance with their respective primary or subsidiary character. But this theory does not appear quite reasonable, because those indi vidual collections of words, which serve to signify things that are of use in the performance of certain actions, can very rightly be taken as separate sentences.
āha ca yatra lakṣaṇamuddiśya lakṣye kāryyaṃ niyujyate /	of It may be urged that the Injunction resting in the generic object could be subsequently specified, exactly like a Mantra, which is at first.
tanmātragrahaṇaṃ tasminnupādāne iyorapi	But in that Mantras, and its mention on the present occasion would be a useless re petition.
kiṃ punaratra saṃdehakāraṇaṃ vidhau sāmānyagrahaṇamiti ke cit / tadayuktam / tatra tāvanmātra nirṇayāt /	Thus then, it is only when they are taken as forming the two parts of a single sentence, that the beginning of the sentence being found to refer to the generic object, and the end to the specific object, there would be an ap parent contradiction but it is a recognised fact that the two must refer to the same object and hence the question very naturally arises as to the signification of which part of the sentence is to be modified in accordance with that of the other.
syādetat / kathaṃ nirviśeṣaṃ sāmānyaṃ saṃbhavatīti, ghṛtavaditi vadāmaḥ /	The Bhashya puts the question Which is the more reasonable ? And the sense of this is that the direct signification is the more reasonable, and not the indirect Indication. Inasmuch as Arthavadas are subsidiary to the Injunction, and are merely descriptive, it is in them that we can have figurative expressions the Injunction, on the other hand, being the principal factor, we can have.
tatrāpi ca navapurāṇagavyamāhiṣādisaṃdehastadava sthastena yathāca ghṛtamātra nirṇayādasaṃdeho viśeṣānabhidhānepi sarvaiḥ kāryasiddhirevamicāpi snehana samarthadravya mātragrahaṇādasaṃdehaḥ /	And further, the specific object Butter can always indicate its concomitant generic object li quid in general, but the generic not being always accompanied by any par ticular specific object, it could never indicate this latter. And again, the Injunction speaking of the general object, could apply to the Butter, only with the help of the Arthavada whereas it would re fer to all oily substances in general, without any help of the Arthavada and hence it is the latter view that is the more reasonable of the two. As for instance, even when the Soma is held up with the Mantra sacred to Rudra, it is not offered to Rudra alone because the Soma for other Deities is capable of being held without a Mantra in the same manner, the Injunction could point to oil, fat and other such substances, without the help of the Arthavada.
tasmādarthavāde ghṛtaśravaṇāt saṃ bhaya ityapare /	Because with reference to oil and fat the persuasive power of the Injunction will have to be assumed, while with reference to the Butter, that power is already present in the Arthavada.
tathāpi na yukto, viśeṣapratipattyā nirṇītatvāt / na hi gaiaurānīyatāṃ śukla ityatra kaiścitsaṃdihyate /	And hence we conclude that Oil, Fat, &c., cannot even form the objects of the Injunc tion. Even though the word in the Injunction be a generic one, that would make no difference because any wetting by a generic entity being impos sible, there is a need of the mention of a particular entity and as the only such entity that is mentioned is the Butter, spoken of in the concluding sentence, we naturally infer the generic word in the Injunction.
katham	to refer to it.
yadi hyevaṃ bhavedaktāḥ śarkarā upadadhāti ghṛteneti / tato naiva kiṃ cidvicārkhetātha tvacanavākyavadāpyevaṃ śrayeta gāmānaya śuklaḥ praśasta iti tato 'styeva saṃdehakāraṇamiti etadapyudācaraṇameva syāt /	And even if the Butter form the generic signification of the word in question, there would be nothing incongruous in the rejecting of oil, &c., none of which are expressed by any wordthrough the direct denotation of the word. All that this does is to remove the doubt and in this it does not contradict the evidence of any means of right notion. Then again, in the case in question it is the mere action of wetting that is enjoined, and not the Material with which the wetting is to be done.
ke ciñca saṃśayadarśanādeva vidhistutyorvā kyāntaratvamācakṣate	And the Action could indicate any and every material, if there were no Vedic passage pointing to any one particular material.
vākyabhede punarekaṃ sāmānye parisamāptamanyadviśeṣaparamiti yuktaḥ saṃdeha / 'yattu vidhinā tvekavākyatvādi'ti tadaṅgapradhānavākyānāmiva paścātsaṃbandhasadbhāvābhiprāyeṇa	In the case in question, however, we find a distinct Arthavada in connection with Butter and hence when the generic form of the Injunction makes it necessary for us to assume a definite particular material, which is not mentioned in the Injunction itself, there can be no ground for assuming any other save that which is eulogised in the Arthavada and hence we conclude the Injunction to mean that the pebbles are to be wetted with butter. And though there might be certain delusive notions of Oil, Fat, &c., yet inas much as there is no basis for these, no harm is done in rejecting them alto gether. And further, if we accepted the Injunction to refer to oil, &c., there would be a threefold Indication viz.
stutīnāṃ vidhyadhīnatvādanuvādācca lakṣaṇā /	the Action would indicate the Material, the Material in general would indicate the particular Material, and the word Butter would indicate the generic entity.
mukhyatvāttu vidhernāsāvavirodhācca kalpyate	Hence we conclude that it is the using of the Butter only that is sup ported by evidence.
kāmaṃ vā so 'rthavādo'stu sāmānyastho ghṛte vidhiḥ /	Sutra Or, it is by means of the potency since this forms a part of the word. In a doubtful case, where there is no subsequent sentence to help us, the real fact is ascertained by means of that potency which forms part of the Injunction.
prathamādhyāyasya caturtha pāda / vinā stutyā vidhānaṃ tu strecadravyāntare bhavet	For instance, in the case of bowing before a god with a view to pro pitiating him, the word anjali denotes the two hands joined together flatly, palm to palm whereas in such sentences as one should not drink water with the anjali, the same word denotes the two hands joined together in such a way as to appear like an elongated cup.
ghṛte prarocanāṃ dṛṣṭvā vidhistatrānumīyate arthādvākalpanaika deśatvāt	Objection Such being the case, according to this rule, inasmuch as we have a subsequent sentence in the form one should do what he can, it would seem that even the blind are entitled to the performance of sacrifices, though apparently not to the looking into the butter, &c.
atha yatreti saṃndigdhe vākyaṃśeṣo na vidyate / tatra sāmarthya siddhena vidhyaṃśenaiva nirṇayaḥ	Hence it follows that so long as the Injunction has not reached its true position, whatever is assumed with a view to accomplish it has a Vedic authority after however the Injunction has been fully established, if anything happens to be assumed, it would have no authority, as originating from a human agent.
yathaiva pāṭhaḥ pratipattyupāyastathaiva sāmarthyamapi śrutīnām /	Specially as the purposes of the subsequent sentence are served, in this case, by the peculiar potency of the Injunction itself. It is with a view to this that it has been saidjust as the text of the Smrtis is a means of the comprehension of their meaning, so also is their peculiar potency or expressiveness.
tenaiva caitā na samāmananti sahasrabhāgaṃ tu samāmaneyuḥ	And it is for this reason that the details that are signified by such potencies are not mentioned directly if the Veda, which makes direct mention of only a thousandth part of it.
iti śrībhaṭṭakumārilaviracite mīmāṃsāvārttike prathamasyādhyāyasya caturthaḥ pādaḥ tantravārtika / śrīmahāgaṇapataye namaḥ	Having entered into the impregnable Fortress of Dharma, which has many inlets to it in the shape of Mantras, Injunctions and Arthavadas, wherein the Smrtis take the place of weapons, and which is protected on all sides by the various branches of the Veda, the author now proceeds to consider the whole subject of the meaning of Vedic texts. End of the Fourth Pada of the First Adhyaya. The Introductory Vārtika. In the opening passage, the Bhashya points out the connection between the two AdhyāyasFirst and Second.
lakṣaṇārtho'tra tattvena bhedaḥ śabdetarādibhiḥ /	For that is called a definition which serves to differentiate a certain object from others similar to it and we find that the Sutras have not been any such definition of Senseperception and the other Pramanas.
tamancapūrvabhedo 'pi prādhānyaṃ tatprasiddhaye	Even Verbal Authority has not, in the First Adhyāya, been defined as a Pramana in fact it is only in the present Adhikarana, that it is going to be defined as such.
dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	That is to say, the whole of the First Pada of the First Adhyaya forms part of the Second Sutra, wherein Dharma has been spoken of as having the Codana for its lakshana means of knowing.
śeṣaśeṣyādayaḥ sarve karmabheda nibandhanāḥ /	For it is not necessary that in order to be a definition of Pramana, it should speak of Pramāṇas in all their bearings because the number of the particular forms of Pramanas being endless, there could be no definition of Pramāṇas at all.
prāk tāvatpramāṇalakṣaṇāḍedārtha vicārātmakatvānna kasya ciṅgedalakṣaṇādeḥ prastāva ityattarakālamārambhaḥ /	Then in the subsequent Padas, it has been shown that the character of Pramana, as belonging to the Smrtis depends upon the fact of these having their basis in the Veda that of Names depends upon the fact of their being included in Codana itself while that of Supplementary Explanations and Indirect Implication, depends upon the fact of these serving the useful purpose of settling doubtful points. And thus there is nothing incongruous in speaking of the whole Adhyāya as treating of the lakshana of Pramanas.
tatrāpi śeṣaśeṣitvaṃ prayojakāprayojakatvaṃ kramaśca bhinnānāṃ bhavatīti na bhedalakṣaṇāprāgārabhyate / tathā 'dhikāraḥ karmasvarūpe 'vadhārite tadyogyatayā śakyo nirūpayitumiti pañcāpi lakṣaṇāni pratīkṣate /	That is to say, the difference among Actions is the natural direct subjectmatter of the Adhyaya and the mention of the nondifference among certain actions is only a denial of the aforesaid difference. And with a view to establish the difference and nondifference of Actions, we have an explanation of the difference and nondifference of their Apurvas. For instance, even in the case of the sentences Vrihin prokshati and Vrihin avahanti, though the words avahanti and prokskoti are different, and as such though the true Actions are distinctly cognised to be different, yet inasmuch as these Actions are found to have their sole end in the visible effects of the preparation of rice and its cleaning, we conclude that they cannot bring about any Apurva transcendental result. As for the Apurva that is held to follow from the restriction of the method of preparing the rice, to threshing alone, it does not result from an Action, and as such is of no consequence in the present context.
tathottaraḥ ṣaṭko 'tideśaviṣayatvā dupadeśajñānādhīnasiddhiḥ samastaḥ samastaṃ pūrvaṣaṭkamapekṣate /	Thus then, the two characters of Verbs having been pointed out, a third has to be shown in the shape of Denotativeness and in con nection with this, we have a consideration of the character of Mantras and then follow the definition, &c., of these and thus these defini tions, &c., treated of to the very end of the Pada, are indirectly con nected with the main subject.
tataśca pariśeṣasiddho 'yaṃ bhedalakṣaṇasya sabandha ityatrārabhyate / yadvidhaḥ karmabheda iti sādhanabhedopacārād vakṣyamāṇasūtrakramānurodhānnāmadheyaṃ saṃkhyānantaraṃ paṭhitavyaṃ sadanādarādante paṭhitam /	Then, having spoken of the difference among Actions, as based upon the difference of words, and repetition of Injunctions, the Sutra will point out, under the Adhikarana on Paurna masya IIii et seq., an exception to the fact of Repetitions being a ground of difference because in the particular case in question the fre quent repetitions are taken only as explanatory to the whole Context. Then as an exception to this exception, we have the Adhikaranas in Sutras II ii to . Then the Sutra proceeds to point out the difference among Actions as based upon differences of Number, Name and Properties and the treat ment of the difference of properties goes on till the commencement of the treatment of the differences of Context and this continues till the be ginning of the Adhikarana treating of the differences of the Branches or Rescensions of the Vedas.
itikaraṇo hetvarthaḥ ṣaḍvidhaḥ karmabheda etaiḥ kāraṇairiti yāvat /	And herein is also contained a denial of any other ground of difference among Actions, save the six, treated of above.
śratha vā karaṇe bhedaśabdaṃ vyutpādya sāmānādhikaraṇyenaiva śabdāntarādīni vyākhyeyāni saṃjñāśabdāntarayoḥ saṃkhyāguṇayoścāpaiaunaruktyaṃ svasthāne vacyāmaḥ /	A R Thus then, the whole subjectmatter of the Adhyāya on Differences is taken up in the setting aside of objections to the fact of the differences of Actions being based upon the difference of Name, Repetition, difference of Properties, and difference of Context. And it is necessary to explain this fact in detail because such ascertainment of difference is absolutely necessary in the due knowledge of the relationship of subserviency between Actions and as for other facts, the present is no opportunity for any mention of these.
yathedamevādhikaraṇaṃ prakṛtānuniṣpādyapūrva bhedānusāra sidhyartha mupohātatvena bhaviṣyati katara smātyadātphalena saṃbadhyamānādasarvabhedābhedāvanugantavyāviti /	Because the relationship between the Primary and the Subsidiary, &c., is de pendent upon a due ascertainment of differences among Actions it is only when the Action has been duly coguised that there can be any ques S tion as to a person being entitled to its performance and it is only when the Injunctions have been duly comprehended that there can be a transference of the properties of one Action to another.
yadā niravayavo vākyavākyārthī syātāṃ tataḥ kiṃ pratipadaṃ dharma ityādirasaṃbaddha eva vicāraḥ syādata /	V,none of these discussions could be raised, until we had thoroughly considered the marks of differences among Actions so too, it is only when the character of the Action has been fully cognised that there can be any consideration of the question as to whether a certain person is entitled to its performance or not Adh.
vākyeca padānāmatho iti /	VI and thus we find that this last question stands in need of all the five foregoing Adhyāyas.

The question to be treated of in this Adhikarana thus comes to be this which is the word in an Injunction which, being related to the result, would point out the difference or nondifference among Apurvas? If the sentence or its meaning were one complete whole by itself in the shape of Sphota, there would be no relevancy to the question raised in the Bhashyadoes each word signify Dharma? It is for this reason that the Bhashya has addedIn a sentence words have significations. But against this question, there is yet another objection Dharma has been declared to be capable of being known by means of the Codana alone then inasmuch as the Codana is always in the form of a sentence, how can there be any question as to Dharma being signified by each of the words? That is to say, if Dharma were directly denotable by words, then alone could there be any question as to whether or not it is signified by each word.
sābātphala sādhanamātrasya dharmatvābhyapagamāt /	It is only in accordance with this last alter native that all the words in the sentence can be found to be signifying the fact of a single Action being Dharma specially as the character of Dharma is held to belong to that alone which is the direct means to the accomplishment of the Result.
na ta sarveṣāmekaḥ kaścidarthosti yaḥ sarvaireka ityevamāśrīyeta /	There is no single thing which is de noted by all the words and as such all the words cannot be accepted to be Aprico denotative of the Dharma.
yacca phalapadena sada saṃbadhyate tasyārthaṃ dharmamapūrvasādhanaṃ ca manyante /	It is only that word which is found to be related to the word signifying the Result, that is taken to be expressive of Dharma, the direct means of the particular Apūrva bringing about that Result. Each one of the words is connected with the Result because, inas much as a uniform relationship is possible only with the principal factor in a sentence, and as it is the Result that is the principal factor,each one of the words must be taken as uniformly related to it.
tena kiṃ sarvāṇi padāni phalena saṃbadhyante kiṃ vā eka miti vicāraḥ /	That is to say, if the sole purpose of the sentence rested solely in the relationship of the Result, then, it might have been possible for the deno tations of all the words to be connected with it.
kutaḥ aikarūpyeṇa sambandhaḥ pradhāne na ca sidhyati /	As a matter of fact, however, the mere relationship of the Result not being enough for estab lishing the full character of Dharma, it becomes necessary to assume an intermediate Apurva.
tasmātphalapadenaiva sarvaṃ saṃbadhyate padam	For these reasons, there can be only one thing that can be related to the Result and it is from this one thing that the Apurva proceeds while all else only helps the action leading to the Result.
yadi hi phala saṃbandhamātraparyavasāyya va vākyaṃ bhavetattaḥ kadā cidapi sarvāṇi phalena saṃbadhyeran/ icha ta tāvanmātreṇāsiddhera pūrvamanyatkalpayitavyaṃ taccānupapatti pramāṇakaṃ, tatraikāpūrvakalpana yopapanne nādṛṣṭāntarakalpanāpramāṇamasti /	Or, the meaning of the verb may be taken as referring to its Instrument, through the factor of the Result indi cated indirectly. And to this we make the following reply That which is connected with the Result is the Principal factor while that which is related to the Principal factor is the Subsidiary and hence the character of both the Primary and the Subsidiary cannot belong to one and the same thing. That is to say, in a single sentence, one and the same word cannot, at one time, be the Principal, on account of its direct relationship to the Result, and at another time, the Subsidiary, on account of its being an aid to that which is directly related to the Result because the character of the Principal and the Subsidiary is not variable. For these reasons, the Apurva must be always admitted to be pointed out either by the Verb or by the Noun.
yo hyanekā nyapūrvāṇi kalpayati kalpayatya sāve kaṃ taccetkalpitamarthavattvādvā kyā kṣīṇā 'nyathānupapattirnāpūrvāntarasya pramāṇaṃ bhavati /	. The Bhashya here raises the question What is a Bhava and what are Bhavaçabdas ? This question emanates from one who holds that in a sentence, the predominant factor in the denotation of such verbs as sacrifices and the like, is that which is signified by the affixes in them and that inasmuch as the conjugational affixes denote the Agent, the Verb cannot but be accepted as denoting either the sacrifice as qualified by the agent, or conversely, the agent as qualified by the sacrifice.
tasmādekameva pha lasaṃbandhi tasmāccāpūrvam itaratphanavadupakārītyadhyavasīyate /	To the questions thus put forward in the Bhashya, the upholder of the Siddhanta theory replies by interpreting the word Bhava as Bhutnic +ac Bhavana, and then by explaining the denotation of the verb to be purely concomitant with such Bhavana, and denying the fact of the verb denoting the Agent and it is with all this in view that he quotes the verbs Yajuti, &c.
na cātra virodho bhaviṣyati nāmadheyatvena parihārāt / agatyā vā daśāpavitreṇa grahaṃ saṃmārśetivanmatvarthalakṣaṇāśrayaṇāt arthāītiprasādhyāṃśadvāreṇa vā dhātvarthairātmīyakaraṇagrahaṇasiddheḥ /	The opponent however thinks that the denotatiou in question does not belong to anything besides the root Bhu with the causal affix, and that the verbal affix can have nothing to do with the Bhāvanā specially as this latter is expressed by an altogether different root he further thinks that though there may be other roots that might denote the Bhavana, yet there are no affixes denotative of it and that as a matter of fact, even the roots, denoting as they do the sacrifice, &c., are not capable of denoting the Bhavanā with all this in view, the opponent has urged the argument The words yaga, homa, &c.
evaṃ sthite kataradekaṃ saṃbadhyatāmiti sarvathānekādṛṣṭa kalpanāparicārād aniyamaprāptau uccate / tantravārtike /	NA To these arguments we make the following reply All verbs always clearly signify the Bhāvanā as interspersed with the sacrifice, &c.
pradhāne phaja saṃbandhi tatsaṃbadhyaṅgamiṣyate /	and as such they are held to be bhāvarthah.
yāvāneva hi ananyalabhyo 'rthaḥ śabdādgamyate sa sarvaḥ śabdārthaḥ /	In the case of any word all that is not cognisable by means of any other word is held to be the meaning of that word and as a matter of fact, wherever a verb is found, it is found to signify the meaning of the root, mixed up with the Bharana and it is for this reason, that the verb is called bhāvārtha.
sarvatra cākhyāte dhātvarthaśca tadanuraktā ca bhāvanā vijñāyate/	Words signifying Sub stances and Properties are always known to be apart from the Bhāvanā and as such the question does not refer to them. signifying substances and properties, and denoting are well capable of being taken as expressing Instrumentality, &c.
tasmādbhāvārthatvavyapadeśaḥ /	and hence it is through this that they come to be related to the Result.
tadvyatiriktāstu dravyaguṇaśabdāḥ vijñāyadvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	serves as the means of the cognition of the Apurva and then all relationship is preceded by a certain want on the part of the members related this want is found to emanate from words signifying Bhāva action, and from those signifying Substance or Property and for this reason the Bhavana of the Apurva is recognised from the verbal conjugational affixes and in this that which is signified by the verbal root is cognised, through proximity, to be the Instrument in the fulfilment of the main Result.
ntaeveti na pṛṣṭāḥ/	And consequently your interpretation is wholly unVedic.
tatra dravyādiśabdānāṃ niṣpannārthābhidhāyināṃ karaṇārthatvayogyatvātprāpnoti phalasaṃgatiḥ /	To this we make the following reply In all cases, it is a general rule that when the Verbal conjugational affix donotes the action of an agent, who is a fully accomplished entity, then the sense of karoti accomplishes is recognised as coextensive with the meaning of the Verb. There are certain roots, added to which, a conjugational affix signifies only that action of the agent which ends in his acquiring his own existence, e.g., is, exists, and the like.
sarvatra di phalaṃ sādhyatvātmirūpaṃ sādhanamapecate na sādhyāntaraṃ, nāmārthaśca siddhatvāttadapeścāpūraṇasamarthaḥ nākhyātāyaiḥ svayameva tāvatsādhyatvā, ttasmāddūvyādibhyaḥ phalamiti prāpta sūtreṇottaraṃ dīyate	Hence in a case where the Agent himself happens to be in the said unsettled position, he stands in need of something else, for the fulfilment of his own exis tence and as such not functioning towards the accomplishment of any other substance, he cannot be spoken of as karoti. When, however, the Agent is a wellestablished entity, and functions towards the fulfilment of something else, then he is spoken of as karoti does. Thus it is that when one asks kin karoti what does he do?, the reply given is , which latter combines within itself the generic pathati S www karoti as well as the specific action pathati whereas in reply to the same question, there can be no such reply as bhavati exists. Thus then, it is clear that all conjugational affixes that signify the actions of Agents that are well established entities, have the the sense of karoti accomplishes. And as such there must be something to be accomplished because unless there is something to be accomplished the word karoti is never used and it is the nominative of the verb to be bhavati that becomes the objective of karoti.
phalasaṃbandho heturapūrvapratipatteḥ /	And thus in the case of each individual Principal Action, there is a multiplicity of actions dependent upon the capabilities of the objects concerned.
saṃbandhaścākāḍāpūrvakaḥ / sā ca bhāvaśabdebhyaḥ prasappaṃnto dṛśyate na dravyaguṇaśabdebhyaḥ /	Though in certain casessuch as padan kuruwe find the verb to accomplish kuru used with reference to an already established entitythe foot, yet what is meant here to be accomplished is not the feet themselves, but certain other pro cesses in connection with them. C Though the root kr has many meanings, yet in all of them is a common element that of the bringing about of something not before exis tent and as such there is nothing incongruous in the general assertion that the word karoti cannot be used unless there is something to be ac complished. Or, it may be that it is only when the root signifies bring ing about or accomplishing that there can be a coordination of its meaning with the sense of the particular conjugational affix and hence it is the object actually brought about that becomes the objective of the Verb.
tasmādākhyātebhyo 'pūrvabhāvanā gamyate tatra ca dhātvarthasya karaṇatvapratipattiḥ pratyāsatteḥ/	Thus then, we have got at the true character of the action to be. And it now follows that that which is the Nominative of the accomplish ing karoti is the Instigator of the action to be while the nominative of the action to be becomes the Instigated of the former person. That is to say, on account of peculiar character of the potentiality of the two roots Karoti and Bhavati, the relation between them is such that the former signifies the action of the Instigator, while the latter does that of the Instigated exactly as there is between the roots pac to cook and viklidi to become softened.
atastenaiva phanakaraṇabhūtenānyathānupapacyā 'pūrvaṃ bhāvyate ityavadhāryyate / kathaṃ punaryajyādīnpṛthakṛtyakevala pratyayavācya eva bhāvanārthī labhyate bhāvayediti /	As has been declared elsewhere Causal verbs are used in connection with the actions of the Instigator, though they always indicate the actions of the Instigated. And further, because the roots bhu and viklidi, &c., are incapable of giving this sense, without the causal affix, that is no reason why other roots karoti pacati, &c., should be equally incapable or con versely, because these latter are capable of giving this particular sense, that is no reason why all the roots should be so capable. Because the natural potentialities of objects cannot be questioned and it is for this reason that roots and affixes signify many meanings.
kutaḥ	Thus then, we find that, through the sense of karoti, all conjuga.
na ca dhātvantarārthaṃ yajyādayaḥ pratipādayanti svārthamācavyāpatatvāt / ataḥ śabdarahitamevedamāropyate bhāvayediti /	tional affixes have the sense of bhavayati.? It is for this reason that persons knowing the true nature of Bhāvanā, explain it as the action of the person instigating, or bringing into exis tence that object which is the nominative of the Action to be. It has been urged above that Injunctive affixes do not signify anything other than Injunctions. But this is not correct because what the Injunctive affixes do is to signify the Verbal Bhāvanā as for the Actual Material Bhāvanā, this is expressed by all conjugational affixes.
kriṃ ca	We have dealt with this in detail under the Adhikarana treating of the Arthavada.
tadyathā pikamānayetyukte yo nāmārthaṃ na pratipadyate tasmai kokina śabdameva kevalaṃ prayuñjate na kokilaḥ pika iti, tathātra yadyākhyātasya karotirṇyanto vā bhavatiḥ paryyāyaḥ tatastadarthakathane tanmātrameva prayoktavyaṃ nākhyātapratyayopi, na hi tadānoṃ vidhicya jñāyate kenāṃśena kriyā pratyāyyataiti /	It has been urged thatin explaining yajeta by yayena bhavayēt, there is an infringement of the laws governing the use of synonymous words see above. To this we make the following reply Inasmuch as the mere root is not capable of being used, with a view to the expression of the Number, &c., of the agent, and for the sake of protecting the original form, we make use of the affix Injunctive in bhavayet. That is to say, if the mere roots kr or bhavi were capable of being used, then we could not make use of the affix as it would be like using together the words pika and kokila but, as a matter of fact, a root by itself is never used for such a use would be wholly incorrect. Thus then, it being absolutely necessary to make use of some one affix when speaking of the meaning of a Verb, it is only natural that we should hit upon that very affix of which we are explaining the meaning as in that case, the second mention of the affix could be taken as descriptive of the former, and helping the root in the usage and any other affix is not used, because such another affix would siguify something over and above what is signi fied by the original word.
atra tu bhāvayetkuryyāditi vā punarapi liṅ prayajyate eva /	Objection But the affixes ik and stip have been laid down as to be used in connection with a root where one has to speak of the root as such and hence we could make use of such forms as bhavih or bhāva yatih, krtih or karotih.
ataśca yo 'nena yajateḥ pareṇārthaḥ pratipāditaḥ asau bhāvayaterapi pareṇa tenaivetyadhikāvāpa eva bhāvayatiḥ /	Thus then, the fact is that when we explain yajēta as yagēna bhavayet, the denotation, by the Injunctive affix in the word bhavayet of the Bhavana itself must be taken as being descriptive of the same Bhavana that is already expressed in yajeta otherwise we would fall into a double mistake that Bhāvanā is the sole meaning of the Affix, and that the roots r and bhu themselves are denotative of the number, &c., of the agent also.
tasmādavaidika iti /	Hence it is absolutely necessary to make use of the particular affix.
atrābhidhīyate /	Affix and the root.
sarvatraiva tāvat sāmānādhikaraṇyena karotyartho 'vagamyate	The same explanation holds respecting the conjugational affixes used in the sense of the Active and the Passive because in the case of these also, the position of the action of the Instigator remains a subordinate one.
karotiḥ kriyamāṇena na kaścitkarmmaṇā vinā /	And the name Kāraka relation between noun and verb is not applicable unless there is an action in the case nor is there any action, which does not. bring about something that did not exist before.
bhavatyarthasya karttā ca karote karmma jāyate	For instance,What should be done?Cooking should be done paktavyam where we have a coordination between the cooking, paka, and the affix tavyashould. Kathankāram juhoti? Abhikrāman juhoti, and so on.
nityaṃ na bhavanaṃ yasya yasya vā nityabhūtatā /	? It is not the form, but the predominant character, of the Bhavanā, that can be said to be directly signified, or indirectly implied, by the con jugational affixes, exclusively.
na tasya kriyamāṇatvaṃ khapuṣpākāśayoriva karotyarthasya yaḥ katī bhavituḥ sa prayojakaḥ /	This argument does not touch our position because, as a matter of fact, the root yaji has a twofold meaning and in pointing out the two phases of the meaning separately, all that we do by mentioning the word yagēna is to point out, separately, the peculiar Instrumentality of the sacri fice, which is a specific form of the signification of the root, the generic form consisting of the Bhavana, in order to point out which we make use of another word bhavayet.
bhavitā tamapecyātha prayojyatvaṃ prapadyate prayojyakarttakai kāntavyāpārapratipādakāḥ /	Or, it may be that there are certain factsf.i., Instrumentality and the number of the Agentthat are signified separately by the root and the affix respectively whereas the Bhavana being quite compatible with both of them, we can hold it to be denoted by both root and affix to gether.
eyantā eva prayujyante tatprayojakakarmmasu śaktayaḥ sarvabhāvānāṃ nānuyojyāḥ svabhāvataḥ /	And it is for this reason that we find both the Sutra and the Bhashya speaking of all Karmaçabdāh Karmaçabdah complete verbs as being gig bhāvārthāh signifying the Bhāvanā, where there is a distinct mention of coextensiveness between whole verbroots and affixes combinedand the signifying of the Bhāvanā. In the MimansaCastra, however, the Bhavana is always held to be signified by the affix.
tena nānā vadantyarthīnprakṛtipratyayādayaḥ yattūktaṃ na vidhitvavyatiriktā liṅādayo 'rthaṃ vadantīti / tadayuktam /	sense of the Affix is always expressed by the Root and the Affix taken to gether and as the Bhavana is the most important factor in this joint signification, it is held to be signified by the affix. That is to say, though there is no other ground for differentiating exactly, by which of the two the Bhavana is denoted, yet, inasmuch as it is a wellestablished fact that greater importance is always attached to the denotation of the affix, and in the case in question, the Bhavana is the most important fac tor, we naturally conclude that this Bhāvanā must be denoted by the affix.
kevalasyāprayogitvātkartṛsaṃkhyādisaṃgrahāt / rūpāvināśasiddheśva pratyayo 'pi prayujyate bhāvanā gamyamānā ca dhātu pratyayasannidhau kasya vācyeti vispaṣṭaṃ na kadā citpratīyate	The Root and the Affix are always found to appear in a definite order of sequence and as a matter of fact, we find that it is only when the Affix is heard to be pronounced, that we have an idea of the Bhavana and this too leads us to the conclusion that the Bhavanā is denoted by the affix. Because the invariable concomitance of any two objects is not only such that one cannot exist in the absence of the other, but also of a kind which we find in the present case, where we find that it is only when a particular wordthe Affix f.i.is pronounced that there is a denotation of the Bhāvanā and as such, in accordance with the rule.
pratyayārthaṃ saha brūtaḥ prakṛtipratyayau sadā /	that when one object is always seen to appear when another appears, there is always an invariable concomitance between the two, we must admit that the Bhavana is denoted by the Affix.
prādhānyādbhāvanā tena pratyayārtho 'vadhārthyate	It has been argued above that in the case of such verbs as asti, and the like, we find the Affix giving up the denotation of the Bhāvanā and as such there can be no concomitance between the two.
tathā kramavatornnityaṃ prakṛtipratyayāṃbhayoḥ /	But this objection is equally applicable to all the theories for instance, even if the Bhavana be held to be denoted by the Root, or the Root and the Affix con jointly, then too, the case of the verbs asti, &c., would be incompatible with the theories.
pratyayaśrutivelāyāṃ bhāvanātmā' vagamyate	Hence the fact is that, whenever the Bhavana is cognised, it is always expressed by the Affix, while in a case where it is not cognised, there is no occasion for any consideration as to by what it is expressed.
dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	And we have already shown under the Tadbhutadhikarana of the Tarkapada that any stray contrary instance cannot vitiate a general rule.
akhyādāvapi kaśe bhāvye 'styeva hi bhāvanā /	Or, we may show that the case of the verbs asti, &c., does not afford instances contrary to our general rule with regard to the denotation of the Bhāvanā.
yadyapi kartturaniṣpannatvād vyatiriktabhāvayitavyābhāvāt atyādiṣu prayojakavyāpāro nātīva lakṣyate tathāpi pratyayasāmarthyābhāvayatotyavagamyate / kimityapeci cāniṣpanne kartaryanyatkiṃ cidityakalpanādātmānamityeva sambadhyate kena bhāvanena kathamavayavajananādiprakāreṇeti /	Because even in the case of the words asti, &c., there is always a part of the Nominative agent that is yet to be accomplished and hence there is always present a Bhavana accomplishing of this unaccomplished portion but the Bhavana, in this case, is not distinctly cognised, because it does not appear as it does in other cases in a rela tion of subserviency to anything apart from the Agent himself. That is to say, in the case of the words asti, &c., though there is no functioning of the nominative agent perceptible, on account of the Agent himself. being still unaccomplished, and of there being nothing besides the Agent to be accomplished, yet it is on account of the inherent potentiality of the Affix itself that we recognise the element of Bhavana. And as for the object of the Bhavana, we have the Agent himself, there being no other object capable of being spoken of, on account of the unaccomplish ed character of the Agent for the Instrument of the Bhavanā, we have the act of being bhavana and as for the Procedure, we have the method of the bringing about, one after another, of the various parts of himself.
trayopi tatra bhāvanāṃśā bhavanenaiva pūryante vyāpārāntarāmambhavāttatra ke cidavayavā bhāvanavyāpṛtāḥ prayujyante ke citmidbhavanāḥ prayojakāḥ /	And thus we find that all the three factors of the Bhavana are supplied in one way or the other, by the act of being itself, specially as the case admits of no other action. Thus then, of the Agent himself, there are certain parts that are still being called into existence, i.e., being accom plished, while there are others that have already been accomplished, which serve as the Nominative agents.
siddhabhavanāsiddhabhavanavati ca sāmānyamubhayasaṃparkādbhāvanetyucyate / etena jāyate niṣpadyate sidhyatītyādīni vyākhyātāni/	And the act of being, which exists in common in those that have been accomplished, as well as in those that are being accomplished, is spoken of as the Bhāvanā. The same arguments apply to the case of such words as jayatē, nishpadyate, siddhyati and the like.. As for the word asti is it expresses a condition of things just following that which is expressed by bhavati becomes synonymous with takes birth, and as such accomplishes the present being of the self and hence it is that it takes one of the conjugational affixes.
tatrāpi tu kālakṛtabhedapūrvettara sāmānyasattārūpeṇa pūrvavadeva prayojyaprayojakavyāpārakalpanānusataivyā /	And in this case also, the differentiation of the functioning of the Actor and the acted upon is to be made as before, with reference to the common character of being that extends over the various parts of the Agent, while differing from another in the point of time of their individual accomplish ment.
sattyāmapi tvevamādiṣu bhāvanāyāṃ niṣpannacetanakartṛviṣayatvādvidhipratiṣedhayorasambhavaḥ / syādetat /	However, though there is such a Bhavana, yet there can be no Injunction or Prohibition with regard to such Bhavanas for the simple reason that they refer to the Agent, who is always a fully accomplished intelligent subject. The following argument is possible We do often come across Injunctions of such being, &c.
rathantaraṃ bhavati/	For instance, Rtvijā bhavitavyam, Rathan taram bhavati, Adhvaryuh syat, Ukthyani syuh, &c.
middho hi puruṣaḥ karmasambandhanimittamṛtviktvaṃ bhavadanyaireva vākkāyamanovyāpārairbhāvayedityucyate /	f The reply to this is that it is true that we meet with such Injunctions but in these cases the word bhavati is not used in its ordinary sense for instance, the meaning of Rtvijā bhavitavyam is that one should ac complish the Rtvikhood, necessary for the performance of the sacrifice, by means of such other actions as purchase, appointment and the like.
tathā rathantarādiṣu satyapi śrutyā bhavana vidhisambandhe ta tra sambhavādanumīyamānā bhāvanaiva vidhīyate /	no such being is possible and hence what the Injunction means is that one should accomplish the Rathantaraa distinct case of Bhavanā.
yatra tviāmuko bhavediti prayogastatra bhavatestiṣṭhatyarthavācitvātmambhavatyeva vyatiriktaṃ bhāvayitavyam ityevaṃ vijñāyate /	Whenever we have such sentences as one should become this or that bhavēt, the root bhu having the sense of stays tishthati,there is always a possibility of something to be accomplished, the sense of the Injunc tion being that one should accomplish something by staying.
tena bhūtabhaviṣyadvarttamānāpadeśamāceṣvevāpāramārthika bhavitṛvyāpārasya bhāvanātvaṃ na vidhyādiṣu /	For these reasons, we conclude that the true character of Bhāvanā belongs to the action of the agent that becomes, only when the verb used signifies the Past, Present or the Future, and not when it is in the Injunc tive, &c.
bhūtādikathane pi yadā samastaṃ vyāpāraṃ dhāturevopādatte nāvayavakānādikṛtabhedāśrayaṇaṃ tadā vispaṣṭādvirodhā dvātvarthamātraṃ kartṛsaṃkhyādayaśca ākhyāta padārthatvenāvadhāryante na bhāvanā /	In the expression of the Past, &c., also, when the complete action is signified by the verbal root itself, and there is no differentiation based upon the difference in the time of the appearance of the different portions of the Agent, then, in that case, the incongruity being patent, the significa tion of the verb must be taken as restricted to the denotation of the root only, and not extending to the Bhavana,the Number, &c., of the Nom inative being taken to be signified by the verbal affix.
na ca bhāvanāvyabhicāreṇa doṣa ityuktam /	And we have already shown that any stray instance to the contrary cannot vitiate our general rule with regard to the Bhāvanā.
yattu kṛdanteṣvapi dhātavo bhāvānāṃ na vyabhicarantīti / satyaṃ dhātvarthā na vyabhicaranti taireva tu gamyamānatvādanabhidheyatvamapi śakyaṃ vaktum /	s action True it is that the denotation of the root always accompanies the Bhāvanā but for the very reason of the Bhāvanā being indirectly implied by these denotations of the roots, it can also be said that the Bhavana is not directly expressed by the root. That is to say, in the case of all words ending in Krt affixes, the character of the Bhavana is cognised as the secondary element, being indirectly implied by the nouns signified by the verbal root, which latter therefore cannot be said to directly denote the Bhavana.
yathaiva bhāvapradhānatvādākhyāte tatsambandhādeva guṇabhūtakārakapratītisiddhernna kartṛkarmmaṇorabhidhānaṃ bhaviṣyatyevaṃ karnādyabhiṣānādeva tadanyathānapapattyā bhāvanāsiddheranabhidhānaṃ gamyamānāpedāyaiva ca karotisāmānādhikaraṇyaṃ, yathā pacatiśabdasya devadattaśabdenā,tathābhūtayaiva ca kārakasambandho 'pyupapatsyate /	Just as in the case of verbal affixes, inasmuch as is the predominant element in the denotation of these, the Noun is always cognised as the secondary factor connected with the denotation of the verbal root and hence the Nominative and the Accusative are not held to be directly expressed by the verbal affix in the same manner, in the case of the Krt affixes, the denotation of the Nominative, &c., not being otherwise possible, these would indirectly imply the Bhavana, which, for this very reason, cannot be said to be directly denoted by the word. And it is only with reference to this implied Bhavanã, that we have such sentences as Kin karoti? Pakamwhere the last word is spoken of as coordinate with the word karoti, exactly as the word Devadattah is used along with the word pacati.
atha vā bhāvanopasarjjanadhātvarthaniṣpattyarthatvātkārakāṇāṃ dhātvarthenaiva sambandhasiddhiḥ/	Or, this relationship may be taken as with the denotation of the root and not with the Bhāvanā, because of the fact of the nouns serving the purpose of accomplishing the denotation of the verbal roots, which are always sub servient to the Bhavana and the denotation of the root too stands in need of these Nouns as serving the purpose of accomplishing the deno tation of the root and the Bhāvanā too refers only to such Nouns hence there is no incongruity in the relationship in question.
sa eva hi tāni svasiddhyarthamapekṣate bhāvanāpi ca tathābhūtānyeva tāni gṛhṇātītyaviruddhaḥ sambandhaḥ / kṛtyānāṃ tu praiṣavācitvātmatyapi bhāvanānabhidhāne tāvatsvārthaparthyavasānaṃ nāsti yāvadaṃśatrayaparipūrṇā bhāvanā na labdhā /	That is to say, apart from his own function, a man cannot perform anything else and the Praishas serve to make him perform these. Hence if these words did not, in some way or other, refer to the function of the man, they could not urge him to its performance and thus too, in this case also, it is found that there is an indirect impli cation of the Bhāvanā which is the name given to the functioning of the agent. As for the Praishas or Directions, contained in the Brāhmaṇas, all these have the character of Vidhi, Injunction, since what they lay down is not got at by any other means and hence, in these cases, the Krtya affixes cannot but be accepted as having the Injunctive signification, even though this signification is not laid down by Panini. The only difference, however, between Injunction and Direction Vidhi and Praisha is that when the object is otherwise remembered, the urging to it is called Praisha Direction while when the same urging is to that which is not otherwise got at, it becomes Vidhi Injunction.
na hi puruṣaḥ svavyāpāra mutkā 'nyadanuṣṭhātuṃ śaktaḥ praiṣāścainadvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Reply This does not affect our position because though it is a fact that the Bhavana is never cognised, entirely apart from the signification of the verbal root, yet the Bhavanā proper that is cognised in a general form covering over many particular actions, is something entirely different. That is to say, in all the particular actions spoken of above, viz. laying the vessel upon the fire, &c.,.
manuṣṭhāpayanti /	we always perceive a common generic action, in the shape of karoti, does.
te yadi tadvyāpāraṃ kathaṃ cinnopādayaḥ na ni yoktuṃ śakkayuḥ ityevamapi bhāvanākṣepasiddhiḥ / yāvāṃśca brāhmaṇagataḥ kaścitpraiṣaḥ sa sarvaḥ prāptyabhāvādidhireva bhavatīti vināpi smaraṇena kṛtyānāṃ vidhāyakatvam /	And among all these actions, the mere action of cessation from inactivity, the mere moving towards the performance of an action, is what is meant by the word Bhavana while all the particular actions, that go to lend colour to the mere activity, and which inhere in the object as well as in the Agent, become related to it, either in the shape of the Instrument or in that of the Process. Objection But in that case, Bhavana comes to be nothing more than a generic denotation of the verbal root. Reply True the Bhavana does appear in a generic form but it is only in the shape of something to be accomplished, and not in the particular forms of the sacrifice, &c. Because the generic idea that accompanies the sacrifice is in the form of the Instrument, which is entirely different from the Bhavana, which is something to be accomplished.
ayameva ca vidhipraiṣayorviśeṣaḥ	With reference to each person, the Bhāvanā has its own peculiar generic and specific forms.
nanu ca yadi prayojaka vyāpāro bhāvaneṣyate tataḥ pacāvadhiyādīni yajau ca mānasaḥ saṅkalpa ityādīnāṃ bhāvanātvaṃ taeva dhātvarthā iti dhātuvāccaiva bhāvanā syāt /	And the sacrifice, &c., appear as Instruments in the Bhāvanā and all that the signification of the verbal root does is to supply the elements wanting in this instrument of the Bhavanā it is this generic denotation of the Root that is expressed by the word karmaçabda Verb and inasmuch as the sacrifice, &c., serve to qualify the Bhavana, they are known as the peculiarities of the Bhavana, and not as the Bhavana itself. In scientific works, however, the words kriyāçabda and karmaçabda are used, sometimes with reference to the denotation of the verbal root, and sometimes with reference to the Bhāvanā, while at times, through proxi mity, with reference to both in any case they are never used to express the particular forms of any of these.
dhātvarthavyatirekeṇa yadyapyeṣā na labhyate /	Because the Bhāvanā or the sig nification of the verbal affix, that is cognised in the case of a conjugational affix, is never expressed, in the same form, by any other word.
tathāpi sarvasāmānyarūpeṇānyā 'vagamyate	Similarly too, with the denotation of the verbal Root.
anyadeva hi yāgādau sāmānyaṃ karaṇātmakam / anyacca bhāvanā nāma sādhyatvena vyavasthitam	For instance, the words karoti, does, and bhāvayati accomplishes, signify something entirely different from that which is expressed by the conjugational affix since that which is signified by karoti and bhāvayati is the Bhavana that has doing and accomplishing for its Instrument and as this is not the form of the Bhavana that is signified in the case of the word yajeta, the two karoti and the Injunctive affix in yajeta cannot be said to be synonymous.
yādṛśī bhāvanā ''khyāte dhātvarthaścāpi yādṛśaḥ /	And the sentence yagēna bhavayêt should be explained, without taking into consideration the Bhāvanā that appears to be signified by the affix in the word bhāvayēt.” Consequently the sentence in question cannot be quoted in support of the theory that bhāvayati or karoti is synonymous with the Injunctive affix in yajeta because the use of the sentence can be ex plained as based upon a certain degree of close proximity between the two.
nāsau tenaiva rūpeṇa kathyate 'nyaiḥ padaḥ ka cit	and not upon an absolute identity of meaning. Thus we conclude that the Bhavana cannot be expressed by any other word.
sambandhamānamuktaṃ ca dhātvarthabhāvaḥ /	As soon as the Bhavana has been cognised, first of all there arises a desire to know what the object of the Bhavana is because the object is the most important factor in it, and also because the object does not stand in need of the desire for any other factor.
śrutyā tadekāṃśaniveśe ta vyāpāro 'syā na vidyate /	And in every Bhāvanā that is endowed with an Injunction, this Injunctiveness, even if previously cognised, is not accepted, until the Bhāvanā, as equipped with all its three factors, is perceived to be capable of being put into action.
sambandhamātraṃ kṛtvā nivṛttavyāpārāyāṃ śrutāvanyanaraśiniveśo yogyatvādāśrayitavyaḥ /	And before the Injunc tive character asserts itself, we must always recognise the fact that the Bhāvanā should be fully equipped with all the elements that make it capable of being put into action.
tadyadi sādhyāṃśādeka pratyayopātena pratyāsannatareṇa vidhitvena pracāvyate tato īśāntareṇa nūnaṃ sampatsyataityevaṃ pratīcyate / kiṃ ca	Thus then, if in any Bhavana, the object to be accomplished were some thing different from that which is desirable to the agent, then no Agent would be found to be engaging in any activity towards the fulfilment of such an object and as such the very promptive potency of the Injunctive affix would become thwarted. Hence it is that, though the denotation of the Root yaj, as related to the Injunctive through the fact of being expressed by a part of the same word as the Injunctive, comes forward to supply the factor of the object of the Bhavana,yet, on account of its inherent incapa bility due to its not being something desirable by the Agent, it is set aside.
bhavane yasya kartṛtvaṃ kathaṃ cidavadhāritam / svavākye vā 'nyavākye vā sa sādhyatvaṃ prapadyate	The Affix can never serve the purpose of prompting towards the Object itself, inasmuch as the Agent always knows what is desirable for him, and it is only in the matter of the particular means, &c., that he needs a prompting. That is to say, it is only in cases where the activity of the Agent is dependent upon Scriptural In junctions, that we seek for Proximity or Nonproximity as pointing out the various elements of the Bhavanā.
tato 'vadhuta svargādisādhyāṃśā bhāvanā kena bhāvaye dityevaṃ karaṇamapecate /	Further, that alone, which has been recognised as the nomi native agent of the action of being, either in the same or another sentence, can have the character of the Object of the Bhāvanā and, as a matter of fact, in the case in question, the denotations of the Root, &c., are not cognised as having any connection with the action of being while Heaven, &c., found in connection with the word desiring, are actually perceived to be connected with the action of being.

And it is always the yaga, Sacrifice denoted by the ro action in yajeta that is recognised as the Instrument because the action of the Agent depending upon the scriptural Instruction, we cannot but seek after what is pointed out by Proximity, &c., as appearing in the text in question and the root is always the most proximate to the Affix because Capability or Incapability too can not be recognised by any other means of right notion, save the text itself because it is only the sacrifice, the recognition whereof as the Instrument is not incompatible with the tenor of the Injunction because there is no ground for reject ing the denotation of the root yaji, that presents itself, as the Instru ment, through its close Proximity to the Injunctive Affix and be cause, as a matter of fact, no Bhāvanā of a particular result is possible with out the agency of that which is denoted by a verbal root.
yadyapi ca yāga svayameva tāvadaniṣpanastathāpi svasādhana niṣpāditaḥ santmādhayiṣyati /	Though the Sacrifice itself is not an accomplished fact, yet, it can accomplish the Result, after it has itself been accomplished by means of its own particular Instrument.
sarvameva ca kadā cinniṣpannaṃ kadā cidaniṣpannam/	And it is a fact of nature that everything in the world is, at one time, in an inaccomplished shape, and at another time, in a fully accomplished state.

And inasmuch as the Instru mentality of sacrifice is actually found to be extending over all the three periods of time, there is nothing very incongruous in speaking of the sacrifice even while unaccomplished as the Instrument of the Bhāvanā.
tasmādyāgādīnāṃ karaṇatvaṃ taccāpūrvadāreṇeti tacchabdebhyo 'pūrvapratītiḥ /	For these reasons, the Instrumentality must be admitted to belong to the sacrifice, &c. But inasmuch as the Result appears at a time very remote from that of the performance of the sacrifice, the Instru mentality of this latter could not be possible, except through the interven ing agency of the Apurva it is for this reason that the words denoting actions are said to bring about the recognition of the Apurva.
ataścaivamapi sūtrārthaḥ sambhavati /	something entirely different from that which is referred to by the denota tion of the Affix.
ye bhāvārthāḥ bhāvanāprayojanāḥ karmmaśabdā yajyādayaḥ tebhyaḥ kriyā pratīyeteti / nanu coktana karmakaraṇa sambandha nyāyena sakarma kaṣātuyuktādevākhyātādbhāvanā 'vagatiḥ prāpnoti /	And though these two roots are intransitive ones, yet there is always a factor of karoti does, or accomplishes, signified by the particular Affix and it is of this karoti transitive that Comfort, &c., are cognised to be the objective. And this karoti being always transitive, even in the case of the conjugational affixes appearing in connection with Intransitive Verbs, there is always a certain coextensiveness between the signification of the particular root and that of the word karoti as we actually find, the questions Kinkaroti, what is he doing?answered by āstē, he is sitting, cete, he is lying down and thus even in the case of these roots we find the Bhavana having a definite objective though the roots are intransitive.
kutaḥ środanaṃ pacati grāmaṃ gacchatīti dhātvarthāpavargalabhyamekaṃ karma, apara punabhāvanākarma /	As a matter of fact, even in the case of the transitive verb yaji, to sacrifice, though the real object is the Deity to whom the sacri fice is offered, yet the objective of the Bhavana is something entirely different, in the shape of Offspring, Heaven, Cattle, and the like.
tacca prāyeṇaivaṃ kāmaśabdenaiva saṃvandhamāpadyate/ sukhakāma āsīta svāsthyakāmaḥ śīyateti /	Thus then, in the case of Transitive, as well as in that of Intransitive Verbs, we have such sentences as asanena bhāvayēt sukham, one should seek to accomplish his pleasure by sitting down.

For instance, in the case of the root to sit, to lie down, the objective is not always definitely cognised and as such they are spoken of as Intransitive whereas the roots to cook, &c. are always accompanied by an objective, which is directly connected with it, through the actions of Softening, &c.
tadujjhitvaiva putrāḥ karmmatvaṃ bhāvanāśritama	and as such these are spoken of as Transitive.
āsanaśayanādau dina niyamenānantaryeṇa vedaṃ taditi vā karma nirūpyate, tenākamakā abhidhīyante / pacigamyādīnāṃ tu vikvidyattatsaṃyujyamānasākṣātmambandhikamrmmāvyabhicārātmakarmakatvaṃ, na tu bhāvanāviśeṣaṇe kaścidiśeṣaḥ /	But this does not make any difference between the two kinds of roots, when referring to a Bhāvanā. The Bhavana then having its two factors of the Objective and the Instrumentduly supplied, there arises a desire to learn the process of this Instrumentality as without a certain process of action no real Instrumenta lity is possible. And then, SensePerception, &c., not being found.

And though one of the words cited by the Bhashya could, by taking it in the causal sense, be spoken of as bhāvārtha, yet the other two are not capable of such constructions though these latter also can have their denotation split up into two partsone part being the action of the Prompter and another that of the Prompted and with reference to the latter, they can be spoken of as bhāvartha and it is for this reason that the Bhashya has cited them.
atha vā dvitīyasūtrārthavyākhyānena bhāvanāprayojanatvamaṃgavācitve nāstīti vināpi sakalārthābhidhānādbhavanti bhāvārthāḥ /	Or, it may be that, in accordance with the interpretation in the following Sutra, the purpose of the Bhavana may be taken as served by only a partial signification only that of the action of being and hence even though the words in question do not signify the whole of the Bhāvanā, yet they can be spoken of as bhāvārtha.

a to viśeṣavācināmeva dhātūnāṃ karmmaśavdatvagrahaṇādacodyametat /	And hence it is that it is only such verbal roots, as denote particular actions, that are recognised as Karmaçabdas and hence the question does not affect our position.
yadi hi prayenacitrādarśa paurṇamāsaśabdāḥ phalaiḥ saṃbadhyeran tato yāgakaraṇatvābhāvāttatsāmānādhikaraṇyanimittanāmadheyadvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	If the words Oyēna, Citrā, &c., names of sacrifices were directly related to the particular results mentioned in the sentence Cyênēnābhi çaran yajeta, &c., then the Sacrifice itself would not have any instru mental agency in the accomplishment of the results and then the words Çyena, &c., could not be taken as Names because it is only because of the coordination of the Instrumental Sacrifice with the words Cyênēna, &c., that these latter are taken as names and then these words would have to be taken as laying down materials for the sacrifices which has been shown above to be absolutely untenable.
nvānupapatteḥ prasiddhyādibhirguṇa vidhitvamevasyādataḥ sthitaetasminadhikaraṇe ityāha /	It is for this reason that the Bhashya has said When we have the present Adhikarana, etc.,etc. That is to say, when, according to the present Adhikarana, the Sacrifice is taken as the Instrument of the Bhavana, then the Cyena cannot but be taken as a mere Name of the sacrifice.
kasmātpunaridaṃ tatraiva na nītaṃ pramāṇantavagonā saṃbandhādatha nāmadheyatvaṃ kasmādatra nānīyate bhedalakṣaṇenāsaṃbandhāttasmādyathānyāsameva sthitayorarthātpaurvāparthyasiddhiḥ /	It may be asked why the fact of the sacrifice being the Instrument of the Bhavana was not ascertained on the previous occasion. But the reason was that the particular fact has no connection with the subject matter of the former Adhyaya, which treats only of the means of knowing Dharma. Then there is the question why should not the fact of Cyēna &c., being names of sacrifices have been left to be treated of on the present occasion? But the reason of this is that this fact has no connection with the Marks of Difference among Actions, which forms the subjectmatter of the present Adhyaya. Therefore the treatment of the two facts must be accepted in their present order of sequence.
nacaiṣāmarthiteti phalapadābhiprāyam /	Says the Bhashya Na caishamarthina, &c.
vivibhaktitvāditi saṃbandhanimittākhyātavibhaktivigamādatha vā niṣpannārthābhidhāyisubvibhaktiviśeṣayogo vivibhaktitvam / tasmānna dravyādiśabdānāṃ phalasaṃbandha iti /	and this refers to the word mentioning the Result i.e., the mention of the Result has no direct concern with the word Citrayā.” Says the Bhashya Vivibhaktikatvat and this may mean because of the disappearance of the Conjugational affix that signifies the pecu liar relationship or because of the presence of the particular Declensional affix which signifies an accomplished entity.
sādhyasādhanasaṃbandhaḥ sarvadā bhāvanāśrayaḥ / tena tasya na siddhiḥ syādbhāvanāpratyayāhate	For these two reasons, the words Citra, &c., that denote certain substances, can have no connection with the particular results mentioned as has been declared The relationship of the means and the object always rests in the Bhāvanā and hence the said relationship could never be accomplished without an affix denoting the Bhavanā.” Sutra ObjectionBut Bhava forms the meaning of all words.
yadi hi bhāvanāvacanasyaivāpūrvapratipādakatvamiṣyate dhātorvā pratyayanirapekṣasya tato nāmapakṣo durbalaḥ syā, dikṣa tu yathaiva dhātoḥ pratyayasaṃbandhānugṛhītasya bhāvanānurañjananimittaṃ karaṇavācitvaṃ bhavatyevaṃ nāmapadasthāpītya viśeṣaḥ /	We cannot admit of the fact of the Apurva being expressed by the Affix, or by the Root by itself directly and as for expressing it in directly, this can be equally done by the Noun also. That is to say, if it were held that the Apurva can be expressible only by that which denotes the Bhavana, or by the root alone by itself, independently of the Affix, then, the theory that it is expressed by Nouns would have been untenable. As a matter of fact, however, just as the root, expressed by the Affix is capable of denoting the instrumentality of the Apurva, indirectly through the agency of the Bhavana, so also is the Noun and as such there is no difference in the two theories.
yeṣāmutpattau sve prayoge rūpopalabdhistāni nāmāni tasmāttebhyaḥ parākāṅkṣā bhūtatvātsve prayoge yaduktaṃ yadai kasmādapūrvaṃ tadā itarattadarthaṃ bhaviṣyatīti tadganaṃ tāvadvastudharmeṇa viśeṣaṃ darśayati /	Sutra Reply Such words, on the utterance whereof the forms of the objects denoted are directly cognised, are Nouns and as such these do not stand in need of anything else, on account of their being selfsufficient in regard to their denotation. It has been already shown above that when the Apurva is expressed by any one factor of the sentence, all else becomes subsidiary to it and we are now going to show the difference in the very characters of the different words themselves.
ekasmādadṛṣṭe kalpite yadotarad dṛṣṭārthatvena tādarthaṃ bhajate tato lāghavaṃ labhyate /	taken as accomplishing certain visible results and thereby becoming sub sidiary to the former and this theory appears to be the simplest under the circumstances.
asya tu tādarthyasiddhaye tato'pi punaradṛṣṭaṃ kalpyataeva tato varaṃ phalenaiva sarvāṇi saṃbaddhāni / na ca saṃbandhavaiyaktemāśrayaṇaṃ nāmnaśca phalasaṃbandhe' vaśyaṃ dhātvarthastadanugrahārtho'bhyupagantavyaḥ /	If, however, for the sake of making the latter subsi diary to the former, we have got to assume other transcendental results to follow from these, then it would be very much simpler to hold all the words to be equally related to the Result nor will this entail the trouble of assuming diverse relationships in the sentence. Now then, if the Noun be held to be directly related to the Result, we would have to call, to the aid of the former, the signification of the Root.
na hi nāmārthastamapeścate śabdaprayogavelāyāmeva niṣpannatayā gamyamānatvādapekṣaṇīyasya vā siddhatvenāyogyatvātprayujyate 'sminniti cābhidheyaeva pra yogaḥ /	This signification of the root, however, being selfsufficient, could not bring any visible help to the denotation of the Noun which is an accomplished entity nor does this latter stand in any need of such visible help because the denotation of the noun is recognised as a fully accomplished entity, at the very time of its being uttered and because that of which it is said to stand in need viz., the Sacrifice as signified by the Root is yet to be accomplished. The word prayoya in the Sutra, means that with regard to which the word is used, i.e., the object denoted by it and it is through this that there is a recognition of the accomplished form of the denotation of the word.
tadādhāraiva hi niṣpanna rūpopalabdhiranutpannatve kriyā pasya vaktavye vināśitva pradarśanaṃ niṣpannasyāpi kṣaṇikatvena panaḥ punarniṣpatyapekṣopapatteḥ /	The form of the Action is said to be perishable, only with a view to point to the fact of that form not having yet appeared specially as even when the action has been accomplished, inasmuch as it is extremely transitory in its character, it always stands in need of repeated accom plishments.
tebhyaḥ parākāṅkṣānyākāṅkṣā niṣpādyatvena vā pradhānākāṅkṣā na vidyataiti adhyāhāraḥ /	Tebhyah parakanksha.This may be explained as that these Nouns do not stand in need of anything else that would serve as their primary in this case it being necessary to supply the words na vidyate or the need for anything else is far away from these.
kutaḥ bhūtatvādeveti /	How? The reply is bhūtatvātthat is to say, because of these being accomplished entities this has been added only with a view to show the real character of things which serves as a reason for the view held by the Sutra.
svarū pakathanārthamupanyastaṃ niṣpannatvādeveti / punarante tadeva hetutvenoddiṣṭaṃ sūtrakāreṇa /	It is always the denotation of the root, as contained in the Verb, that is cognised as something to be accomplished and when this is held to be connected directly with the Result, the Noun must be taken as serving That is to say, from its very character, the denotation of the Root is cognised as something to be accomplished, which latter is distinctly specified by such roots as form parts of particular verbs.
yeṣāṃ tūtpattāvarthe sve prayogo na vidyate tānyākhyātāni tasmātebhyaḥ pratītatvātprayo dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Hence when such a denotation of the Root is laid down as the means to a Distinct Result, in asmuch as the former itself is something yet to be accomplished, it stands in need of an Instrument and what the Noun does is to lay down either the accessories of the sacrifice denoted by the Root, or to appear only as the Name of a particular sacrifice or do both and thereby it becomes subsidiary to the denotation of the Root.
akhyātavarttī dhātvarthaḥ mādhyarūpaḥ pratīyate /	Objection If you hold it to appear as the Name, then, inasmuch as the word that appears as the Noun would also be something to be accomplished, this too would be equal in all respects to the denotation of the Root.
tasminphalavatīṣṭe tu nāmno dṛṣṭārthateṣyate	Reply Not so Because if the Name be held to be directly con nected with the Result, it would only be taken as an Accessory and as such an accomplished entity and this would strike at its very character of the Name.
sādhyātmako 'pi dhātvarthe/ yadā nāmnā 'bhidhīyate /	That is to say, though the denotation of the Root is in the form of something to be accomplished, yet whenever it happens to be mentioned by a Noun, it is always accompanied by distinct notions of Gender and Num ber, and as such a fully accomplished entity.
tadā dravyavadevāsau niṣpannātmā pratīyate	Because of the object being dependent, this serves to point out the difference between the Noun and the Verb, as based upon the degrees of proximity to the words.
codanā punarārambhaḥ	Sutra There is an Apurva because of the Injunction.
siddhaṃ kṛtvā 'pūrvaṃ tatpratipattyupāyaśabda viśeṣa vicāraḥ kṛtaḥ / tasya siddhatvamevāprasiddhamatastadeva tāvatpratipādanīyamityata ātantravārtika / phalāya vihitaṃ karmma kṣaṇikaṃ cirabhāvine /	Inasmuch as sacrifices have been laid down for the purpose of certain definite results, to follow after the lapse of a long time,such deferred fruition of the Action would not be possible, unless there was an inter vening agency of the Apurva. That is to say, the Apparent Inconsis tency of the relationship of sacrifices and such results as the attainment of Heaven, &c., laid down in the Veda,points to the fact that the existence of the Apūrva also is laid down in the Veda itself and as such it is quite authoritative. Some people notably the author of the Vrtti on the Sutrasthinking themselves to be exceptionally clever, seek to disprove the Apurva in the following manner.
tatsiddhinnī nyathetyevamapūrvaṃ prati gamyate	And, as a matter of fact, none of the former five are found to be applicable to the Apurva and hence, being totally foreign Apurva to the means of right notion, it is a nonentity, and as such the name Apūrva is quite proper for it.
pramāṇapañcakā'jñānādaparvaṃ ṣaṣṭhagocaraḥ /	The Apurva is not cognised by means of Senseperception, be cause not being of the nature of the objects of Sense,Colour, &c.,it cannot be cognised by means of the eye, &c.
tasmādanvarthanāmaitanna vastutvena gamyate padavākye na caitasya vācaka śṛṇumaḥ kva cit /	We do not know of any word or sentence denotative of the Apūrva and hence it cannot be held to be an object of verbal cog nition. And as for its cognition being based upon the Veda, this could be possible, only if it were expressed by either a Word or a Sentence. And as a matter fact, there is no word that is directly expressive of the Apurva.
śabdagamyatvamapyasya tena naivopapadyate dṛṣṭāthī pattistāva mastitvavadevātrāpi nirākarttavyā /	As for the word Apurva itself, it only expresses the true state nonexistent of any such thing such denies its existence totally. And as a rule, words cannot apply to a thing not cognised by any other means of cognition as it has already been shown that the Word itself is not an independent means of notion.
sva bhāvādināpi īśvaradaridrādivaicivyopapatteḥ / śrutārthīpattirapi kīdṛśī bhavati yatra pratyakṣeṇaivānupapattirdṛśyate /	Though for the cognition of difference among objects, the Sutra lays down such means as Different Words, &c., and Direct Assertion, &c.,yet these also are applicable only to the differentiation or usage of such objects as have a natural existence of their own and they cannot serve to point out the existence of anything and as such they cannot serve as the means of cognising the Apurva.
na ca kalpya māno'rtha kena cihirudhyate /	And as for Indirect Im plication Atidēça, this cannot apply to anything that has not been cognised by means of Direct Assertion.
tadyathā suveṇāvatītyukte na ca kathaṃ cidapi māṃsapuroḍābhādīni tenāvadātuṃ śakyantaiti pratyakṣagamyatvāt / api ca tatrāpi prasaktaḥ evaṃ kalpyate dravāṇāmiti / na caiṣākalpanā kena cidvirudhyate śrutānyaśrutapa rikalpanābhāvāt /	And further, the whole of the Veda treating of mere Injunctions and Prohibitions, it is never found to point out the existence of objects and hence there can be no scrip tural authority for the Apurva. That which has never been seen, and hence anything similar to which has never been seen, can never form the object of Analogy. In fact, being never perceived, the Apurva could be held to be analogous only to nonentities, like the bares horns, which also are never per ceived.
apūrvaṃ tu na kadā citphalasāghanatvena saṃ bhāvyate /	Even Apparent Inconsistency does not show that there actually is any such thing as Apurva because the relationship of the Sacrifice and its Result is capable of other explanations.
yato 'nvakāraṇaniṣedhe sati taddiṣayā pariśetrasiddhiḥ sthāna	b As for the Apparent Inconsistency of something that has been directly asserted, this applies only to such cases where the Inconsistency is perceptible. In the present case, however, we have to deal with something that is assumed and certainly any such thing cannot be said to be inconsistent with something else.
api ca yadi tāvadapūrvaṃ yāgasya sādhyamiṣyate tataḥ śrutaṃ svagaṃ pariparikalpitaṃ bhavet / tantravārtika /	For instance, when it is said that the material to be offered should be cut out by the Sruva, it is distinctly perceptible that such materials as Meat, Cake and the like are incapable of being cut by it and as the general direc tion is applicable to these latter also, the direction is interpreted as that it is only the cutting out of liquids, or semiliquids, that is to be done by the Sruva.
na cākārāntareṇa tannirūpayituṃ śakyate /	And this assumed interpretation is not inconsistent with anything because it does not entail the rejection of something directly laid down and the assumption of something not so laid down.
tenāgamaprāmāṇyādyāgādeva phalena bhavitavyam /	As for the Apurva, it can never be conceived of as the means to a result and as such it can not be urged that from among various means to the Result, all others being inapplicable to the case in question, it is the Apurva alone that can be accepted as the means, by the Law of Pariçesha Alternatives.
kathaṃ naṣṭaḥ sādhayatīti cet /	And further, if the mere fact of the inapplicability of other means were to serve as the sole ground for the application of the said Law of Alternatives, why cannot we assume the Horns of the Hare to be the means in question? That is to say, the mere fact of the absence of any other cause, cannot justify the assumption of Apurva being the neces sary means because the reason would be equally applicable to the agency of the hares horns as well.
ya di śākhādevaṃ gamyate kiṃ bhavato viruddhyate/ śriyamāṇena vā phalaṃ sāghanīyamityatra kiṃ pramāṇam/	And, further, if the Apūrva be held to be something brought about by the Sacrifice, then that would mean a rejection of the Heaven, which is the directly asserted objective of the Sacrifice, and the assumption of a thing not so asserted. And secondly, if the Apurva be held to be the means to the particular Result, that would mean the rejection of the Sacrifice, which is the directly asserted means to the Result, and the character that could be attributed to the Apurva.
api ca ākāśādīni nityāvasthitāni kasmātphalaṃ na sādhayanti/ yadi ca śrayamāṇātirekesthāyitva saṃbhavāda pūrveṇa phalaṃ sādhyataiti kalpyane tato va ramākāśādeva kalpitaṃ, tasya hi sthānasabhāvāvapi tāvatprasidvai/ kevalaṃ phalanimittatvamāśrayaṇīyam /	If it be askedhow can the Sacrifice, being itself immediately destroyed, bring about the result ?all that we have to say, in reply, “is that, when such an effectiveness is mentioned in the Scriptures, why should it bother your head? For certainly, what is your authority for holding that the longstanding Apurva, left by the Sacrifice brings about the Result ? If it be a law that it is only longstanding causes that can bring about any effects, then why should it not be held that the Results are brought about by the Akaça, and such eternal things? If it be urged that, we assume the Result to be brought about by the Apūrva, simply because that alone is capable of a continuous existence other than what is possible for that Sacrifice which is laid down as the means then, it would be far more reasonable to assume the Result to follow from the Akaça, &c.
pūrve tu sadbhāvaprabhṛti sarve niṣpramāṇakaṃ kalpanīyam /	but in this latter case, inasmuch as the existence of these is universally recognised, you would have to as sume only their agency in the bringing about of the Result where as in the case of the Apurva, you have got to assume everything, beginning from its very existence, without any authority whatever.
atha yāga saṃbandhinā kena cidavasthitena phalaṃ dātavyamityabhiprāyaḥ, tathā satyapi yaṣṭurevātmano yāgaissaṃgatasya sthitasya ca /	If you mean to say that, the Result must be brought about by some such agency as has some degree of permanence, and is connected with the Sacrifice which cannot be said of Akaça, &c.,even then, it would be very much simpler to assume the Result to be brought about by the Soul of the Sacrificer, which is connected with the Sac rifice, and is permanent. That is to say, the Sacrifice itself being tran sitory, if the Result brought about by something connected with it can be spoken of as brought about by the Sacrifice, then certainly it is very much simpler to assume that it is brought about by the soul of the person who has performed the Sacrifice.
yadā karmmavināśo'yaṃ phalaṃ naḥ sādhayiṣyati / aṅgiyāgavidhānādvi tadayatnena kalpyate	And it is a rule that that which leads to the cognition of something else is the means to this latter and in the case in question, we find that it is the destruction of the action that gives us an idea of the occurrence of the Result at some other time and hence this Destruction must be admitted to be the means to the Result. It may be urged that a nonentity is never held to be an effective agent.
yadi caikānta to brūyaḥ śabdāḥ kālāntare phalam /	And further, if the words of the Veda itself could express the fact of the Result following at some other time, then alone could we, on the strength of that, assume the intervening agency of something else. That is to say, the Vedic Injunction is found to serve the purpose of .
tatastenaiva kalpyeta nimittaṃ vastu kiṃ cana pūrvaṃ niścitya śākhārthaṃ prayoge hi pravarttate / prayogottarakālaṃ tuna śākhārtho 'vadhāryate /	pointing out the relation between a certain Action and a Result and no mention is found therein of any other time and hence from the nature of Actions in general, we would naturally assume the result of the Ac tion enjoined to follow immediately after it why then should we, in the first place, assume the result to occur at some other time, and then, secondly, assume the intervening agency of the Apurva ? Here it may be urged that at the time that the Action is per formed, the Result is not found to appear immediately after it and wi are forced to the conclusion that the Result must follow at some other time, and that the Apūrva is the agent that intervenes between the perfor of the Action and the appearance of the Result.
nahi avidvānvihitostīti tāvadavaśyaṃ yāvacchāsagamyaṃ ta tsarvaṃ prāganuṣṭānādavagantavyam /	That is to say, none that is ignorant of Vedic Injunctions is entitled to the performance of any Sacrifice and hence prior to the performance of the Sacrifice, it is absolutely necessary for the performer to have a full comprehension of all that is implied in the Injunctions.
na ca tatkāle karmmaphalakā la viyogajñānakāraṇamasti /	And as a matter of fact, at the time of this comprehension, there is not the least idea of the fact of the Result of the Action not appearing at the time of its performance.
yacca śāstra pravṛttivelāyā tadantargatanvena nāvadhāritaṃ taduttarakālamevāvadhārthyanaiti kuna etat / a pica	That is to say, we actually find a certain deficiency in the performer or in the performance of the Action, which supplies the necessary explanation of the fact of the esult not appearing immediately after the Action is performed and hence there can be no ground for assuming an Apurva, for the sake of the appearance of the Result at some other time.
sukhaduḥkhātmakatvena samāneṣveva janmasu /	Nor can the Apurva be assumed with a view to the appearance of Results during future lives. Because Heaven and Hell consisting of only Pleasure and Pain, respectively, these two are actually experienced by the www.
kriyānantarameveha staḥ kharganarakāvapi pratiṣedheṣu cāpūrvaṃ na śākhārthena janyate / tadatikramajanyaṃ tu na bhavecchā khapūrvakam	And even if such an Apurva were assumed, being itself without any action, it could not be capable of carrying the body of the person to any other place, at some other time and thus too it would be absolutely useless. Nor is it possible for the Apūrva to have any substratum because the substratum of the action itself is the sacrificial Cake, and such other things appertaining to the sacrifice and all these are destroyed with the Action and nothing apart from such substrata of the Action could serve as the substratum of the connected Apurva.
aṅgāni yadi vā 'pūrvaṃ kurvantyārādavasthitam / asambandhātpradhānānāṃ na syāttenopakārthyatā	And further, if the Subsidiary Apurvas be held to lead to the Principal Apurva at a distance, then the subsidiaries not being directly related to the Principal Action, they could not serve any useful purpose. That is to say, even if we assume a subsidiary Apurva, this could not be of any use, unless related to the Principal Action.
na cānavayavatvāttatkramaśo 'pi pratīyate	Nor is it possible for it to fall in with either the Principal Action itself or its Apurva, because of the immaterial character of these.
sarvābhivyaktīnāṃ cayānyatamasaṃskāradvāratvātsaṃskārāntaramavaśyaṃ kalpanīyaṃ tataḥ punaḥ sa eva keśaḥ ityapramāṇatā / yadi ca kiyānantaramapūrvamupalabhyeta tato 'bhivyajyate iti brūyāma /	And further, inasmuch as all subsidiary actions are mentioned simultaneously by a single sentence, all the subsidiary Apurvas would ac cord their help simultaneously but no such simultaneous action is pos sible unless they are related to one another as a matter of fact, however, there is no ground for any such relationship. The same argnments apply to the simultaneous action of the Principal Apurvas towards the comple tion of the Result. Therefore we conclude that on account of the mere fact of its being performed, the Principal Action produces the Result in the Man, and the subsidiary Actions bring about their results in the Principal Action.
na tu tadubhayamapyastīti sarvathā nāstyapūrvaṃ na caitatsūtraṃ tatpratipādane vispaṣṭamityavyākhyānametat /	Nor again is it possible for the Apurva to be either produced or mani fested. Because it could not be produced all at once, by a number of actions that appear one after the other and being devoid of constituent parts it could not be believed to be produced in any sequential order.
atrocyate /	And hence it can never be said to be produced.
yadidaṃ svamatiparikalpitaṃ vigrahava divā'pūrvaṃ bhavadbhinirākriyatena tenāsmākaṃ kiṃ cidvirudhyate / yato naitattādṛśaṃ kasya cidiṣṭaṃ, kiṃ tarhi karmabhyaḥ prāgayogyasya karmmaṇaḥ puruṣamya vā yogyatā śāstragamyā yā parā sāpūrva miṣyate /	That is to say, all manifestations are brought about by means of the effect produced upon one of the afore said three the sense, the object, or both and hence in the case in question, it becomes necessary to assume another such effect Sanskāra. Then again, for the sake of this last, we have to assume another Sans kāra and hence this theory cannot be said to have any authority. If the Apurva were perceived after the performance of the Action, then we could speak of its being manifested because it is only that which exists that can be manifested, and that too, if there were some authoritative means of cognising its existence.
pradhānakarmaṇāmaṅgakarmaṇāṃ vā prākaraṇātsvargādiprāptyayogyāḥ puruṣāḥ kratavaśva svakāryyāyogyāḥ / tāmubhayīmapyayogyatāṃ vyudasya pradhānairaṅgeśya yogyatoṣajanyanaitya va saṃ sarveṇṇābhyupagantavyam/	The peculiar kind of Apurva that you have reared up in your own imagination, to have a tangible body, is nothing to us, and as such a refu tation of that need not trouble us at all. For the simple reason that the Apurva that we hold is not what you have refuted, but we mean by it a certain capability in the Principal Action or in the Agent, which did not exist prior to the performance of the action, and which is duly based upon the authority of the Scriptures. Before the Principal or the Subsidi ary actions are performed, men are incapable of reaching Heaven, and the Principal Sacrifices are incapable of bringing about their results. And it must be admitted that both these incapabilitiesone in the agent and another in the Principal Actionare set aside by the duly performed Principal and Subsidiary sacrifices, which then produce a certain capability in them.
asatyāṃ tasyāmakṛtasamatvaprasaṅgāt /	Because unless the said capability be produced the Actions remain as good as unperformed.
saiva ca puruṣagatā ṛtugatā vā yogyatā śāstre 'sminnapūrvamityapadigyate /	And it is this capability, in the Agent or in the Principal Sacrifice, that is called, in our philosophy, the Apurva.
yattu pratyakṣādigamyatvamasya nāstīti, satyaṃ śrutārthāpattivyatiriktairna gamyate sa tvadoṣaḥ kiṃ kāraṇam /	You have urged that the Apūrva is not cognisable by any of the re cognised means of right notion, Senseperception and the rest. This is true inasmuch as the only means of cognising the Apurva is the Apparent Inconsisteney of something mentioned in the Veda and hence your argument does not quite affect our position.
śabdakadeśabhāvācca svārtheṣvāgama eva naḥ	Specially because we also hold only such Apparent Inconsistency to be the means of knowing the Apurva and inasmuch as this Apparent Inconsistency forms a part of Verbal Testimony, our sole authority for the Apurva is the Scripture itself.
kṣaṇikatvena sarvatra naikasyāpi hi karmmaṇaḥ / kathaṃ cidyugapadvṛttiḥ phale kimuta bhūyasām	Because all actions being transitory, it is not possible for even a single action to exert a simultaneous influence upon the Result how then can this be possible in the case of many actions? That is to say, when the action is taken in hand, inasmuch as it is made up of many momentary parts, it is incapable of applying al at once to any Result, and this becomes all the more impossible when the Actions such as the DarçaPūrṇamāsa, etc.are made up of many supple mentary Actions.
śaktibhiḥ sarvabhāvānāṃ vyavahārānupātitā/ tenānyadeśakālepi rūpe tābhiḥ sa sidhyati	For instance, all objects are found to act their parts, in all ordinary usage, only by means of their capabilities and hence presence the usage can be accomplished by means of the capabilities, even if the physical form of the action exist at some other time and place.
yāgādeva phalaṃ taddhi śaktidvāreṇa sidhyati /	As a matter of fact, however, that which is brought about by the potency left behind in the Agent by the Sacrifice, is brought about by the Sacrifice itself specially as all Causes in the world, in the bringing about of their particular results, stand in need of certain intermediate actions.
sūkṣmaśaktyātmakaṃ vā tatphalamevopajāyate	And hence, in the appearance of this sproutlike Apūrva, the Heaven itself becomes produced and in this case, all the time that inter venes between the determination to perform the sacrifice and the experi encing of the last iota of the Result, is counted as the Present.
kāṣṭhaiḥ paktavyamityukte nirdiṣṭā jvalanakriyā / aṅgure jāyamāne ca vṛścopyutpanna iṣyate	It has also been declared elsewhere When one says one should cook the food by means of fuel, the action of burning is understood and as soon as the sprout has sprung up, it is taken for granted that the tree has grown.? It has been urged above that before the Action has been actually performed, there can be no idea of any such thing as the Apūrva.
vināśitvena vijñātaṃ sādhanaṃ lokavedayoḥ / sambhāvita sāmarthya sthāyitvaṃ codyate katham	But this is not true because all Means, either Vedic or of the ordinary world, are known to be transitory and then unless there is some idea of the permanence of some sort of a potency left behind by the Means, how could such a Means be enjoined in the Veda? That is to say, unless we actually recognise the fact that the potency left behind by the Means, which itself is past and gone, subsists till the final accomplishment of the Result, there is no possibility of a transitory Action being enjoined and hence it is proved that the idea of the possibility of such a potency exists before the Action is performed.
na cātikrāntayāgebhyaḥ puruṣebhyaḥ phalodgatiḥ /	Nor can the Result be said to be brought about by the souls of the persons that have performed the sacrifice because, in accordance with your theory, there is no difference made in the soul, either by the performance or the nonperformance of the sacrifice.
atikrāntā natikrānta viśeṣastava nāsti hi	And as for the character of the performer of the sacrifice, it does not persist in the soul of the person who is at some other time devoid of the action, and occupies an altogether different position.
aṅgamadhye 'pi karttava bhaveccedu prakārakaḥ /	The above objections apply also to the theory that the Result pro ceeds from the Destruction of the Action.
prasaṅgasiddheraṅgānāmaprāptirvikṛtau bhavet	Because one who holds the Result to follow from such Destruction could have no difference among the Destructions of good and evil actions, or between those of one or many actions, or among various kinds of negation itselfviz.
eko rogo hṛto yasya yasya vā 'pahṛtā daśa /	For instance, one who has been cured of one disease, as well as one who has been cured of many, in the case of both of these men, the fact of being cured is just the same.
arogitve tayorbhedo na kaścidapi dṛśyate	In the case in question, however, we perceive no other active entity save the Apurva. It has been urged above that in ordinary experience the Apurva too has never been perceived to have a causal action.
na ca karmmavināśebhyaḥ svargādi śrūyate phalam / viparyyayāca naitebhyo jātaṃ yāgasya tadbhavet	Injunction does not speak of any Result following at any other time and the only theory that is in keeping with the scriptural Injunction is that the Result follows immediately after the action has been performed and hence it is only such immediate sequence of the result that can be said to be enjoined but in refutation of this we have already brought forward the fact that the Actions being many and all transitory, no immediate sequence to the Action is ever possible..
aihikaṃ cāpi putrādi kramajanmasvabhāvakam /	Even such ordinary worldly resultsas children, &c.having the nature of appearing gradually, do not appear immediately after the per formance of the action and people do not ever think of obtaining the Result immediately after the action.

Inasmuch as such objects as landed pro perty, &c., have their full fruition in the use to which they are brought, which requires a certain amount of time, such fruition would be impossible immediately after the Action hence in the course of this time, whenever the activity of the cause would cease, the Result would be finished and done with all at once consequently it is absolutely necessary that there should be some sort of a causal agency subsisting till the accomplishment of the last iota of the Result. And this fact being duly ascertained before the performance of the Action, it cannot be rightly urged that the Apparent Inconsistency of the fruition of the Result would be equally explicable on the ground of certain deficiencies in the character of the Performer, detected after the per formance of the sacrifice has been found to be not immediately followed by the Result.
tataśca prāgeva prayogādityamavadhāraṇātkarṭavaiguṇyābha jhyā 'rthāpatteranai kāntikatvamityayuktametat / yattu pratiṣedheṣu na stra gamyamapūrvamityucyate vidheyebhyo yathā 'pūrvaṃ vidhiśāstreṣu gamyate /	But just as in the case a Scriptural Injunction, an Apurva fol lows from the Act enjoined, so, in the same manner, in the case of Prohi bitions, an Apurva must follow from that which is prohibited. actions as the killing of a Brāhmaṇa, are not ordinarily recognised as leading to a fall into Hell, yet when the particular prohibition of such killing has been met with, it naturally leads to the assumption of its bringing about an Apurva capable of leading the person into Hell and this Apurva too is as Vedic in its character as the former Apurvas. Even though the Apūrva is devoid of any such apparent actions as motion and the like, yet by a mere connection with the performer, it becomes capable of such actions as leading him to other places, &c.
tathaiva pratiṣedhebhyaḥ pratiṣedhaistaducyate	and as such the absence of any apparent activity cannot be urged against it with any effect.
karteva cāśrayastasya kriyā 'pyacaiva ca sthitā / ātmavāde sthitaṃ hyetatkartṛtvaṃ sarvakarmasu	And it is the soul of the performer himself that serves as the substrate of the Apurva hence the said action also rests in this soul itself as we have already shown, under the chapter on Soul, that of all Actions the active agent is the Soul. That is to say, it has been shown that of all such actions as the cutting out of the Cake, and offering it, &c., it is the Soul that is the active agent, through its specific action of determination, &c.
yadi svasamavenaiva śaktiriṣyeta karmmaṇām / tadvināśe tato na syātkartṛsthā tu na naśyati	It may be asked How can the potency of that which has been destroyed subsist ? But to this we make the following reply If the potencies of actions were held to lie within themselves, then on the destruc tion of these, they could not subsist but when they inhere in the soul of the performer, there is no reason why they should not subsist. Question But how can the potency of one thing inhere in another? Answer There is no absolute difference between the Action and the Soul of the Performer.
śaktiḥ kāryyānumeyatvād yadgataivopayujyate / tadgataivābhyupetavyā khāśrayā'nyāśrayā'pi vā	And as a matter of fact, when looking for a potency, inasmuch as its assumption rests upon its effects, we must always accept it to lie in a substrate where it might be of the greatest use, be this substrate the Action itself or something else. That is to say, when we find that a destruction of the Action makes entirely useless any potency that inheres in that Action, and that it is absolutely necessary to postulate such a potency, then, just as its peculiar form, so its substrate too, must be assumed to be such as would make it of the greatest use.
tādarthyena hi śeṣatvaṃ nāśrayāyibhāvataḥ / rājārthī payikaṃ nityamuṣṭo vahati kuṅkumam	But this does not affect our becomes only an end in itself desirable by men. position because one thing becomes subservient to another, only when its sole use lies in the serving of some purpose of this latter, and not merely when it rests in this for instance, though the Red Dye is carried by the camel and as such rests upon its back, yet it serves the purposes of the king for whom it is carried.
arthāpattarihāpūrvaṃ pūrvamekaṃ pratīyate /	and inasmuch as the Principal Action also inheres, to a certain degree, in the corn, the afore said effect rests aside, only after it has helped in the accomplishment of the Principal Apūrva.
tatastatsiddaye bhūyaḥ syādapūrvāntarapramā	to come, the Principal Apurvas are acomplished, then in that case, there would be no need of actually performing the subsidiary sacrifices as . their will have been fulfilled prior to their performance.
pramāṇavantyadṛṣṭāni kalpyante subahanyapi /	That is to say, inasmuch as with regard to the main Result all the Principal Actions are mentioned simultaneously, and so are also the Subsidiary Actions with regard to the Principal ones, all the necessary requirements of the said relationships.
adṛṣṭaśatabhāgo'pi na kalpyo hyapramāṇakaḥ	And it is a rule, in all cases, that a large number of unseen agencies may always be assumed, when all of them are justified by some authority while even the hundredth part of an unseen agency should not be assumed, if there is no authority for it.
āvṛttibhiryyathā'dhyāye saṃskāro bhavati kramāt / vākyāvayavarūpeṇa tathā 'pūrvaṃ bhaviṣyati	The same course of reasoning might be adopted in meeting the objec tions with regard to the impossibility of the Apurva being either pro duced or manifested. It has also been declared that Just as in a frequent repetition of the Veda, the impression made upon the mind is always gradual, being as it is, in the form of the various parts of the sentences, one by one so also would be the case with the appearance of the Apurva.
naikarūpaiva bhāvānāmabhivyaktiḥ pratīyate /	Nor is it an absolute rule that there can be no parts of an immaterial object. Because the aforesaid Apparent Inconsistency would also justify the conclusion that the immaterial Apūrva is cognised in the form of extremely minute parts.
tasmādastyapūrvaṃ sūtrasyāpi ca na prakṛtīprayikamanyamarthaṃ pa śyāmaḥ / tenārambhacodanaivāpūrvasyāpi codanetyayamevārthaḥ /	Thus then, we conclude that the Apurva does exist and the Sutra too cannot be taken in any other sense, that would be of any use in the present context and hence we take the meaning of the Sutra to be that the Injunction of the Action is the Injunction authority of the Apurva. The view here tentatively brought foward emanates from one who finds the assumption of the Apurva to be utterly groundless, and hence prefers the comparatively reasonable theory of the nondestruc tion of the Action.
na hi karmaṇāṃ rūpamu palabhāmacaityayuktaṃ rūpaśabdāvibhāgācetyatra pratyakṣopalabdhyabhidhānāt /	This assertion is not quite correct because Action has been distinctly mentioned as perceptible by the Senses, under Sutra Rupaçabdāvibhāgācca Again the subjectmatter of the discourse is Sacrifice, which is not of the nature of Motion and yet the Bhashya cites a definition that applies only to such actions as are of the nature of Motion and this cannot but be rejected as irrelevant.
atrocyate tantravārtika /	To the above, we make the following replies I.
yadyapi karmmasvarūpamupalabhyate tathāpi kālāntarāṣasthānābhāṃvād na tadupayujyataiti nopalabhāmahaityucyate	What is meant by the assertion that no shape of Action is perceived is that we are not cognisant of any such form of Actions as would enable them to function at a future time aud as for the impermanent forms of Actions that are perceived, these can be of no use in the bringing about of the final Result. That is to say, though a shape of the Action is perceived, yet, inasmuch as this does not continue for any length of time, it can be of no use in the bringing about of the Result and as such it is as good as not perceived and is spoken of as such.
na hi saṅkalpamātreṇa phalaniṣpattiḥ samastātmamastetikarttavyatākācca karmmaṇaḥ phalaśravaṇā, ttatra dvyavadānaprakṣepādīnāṃ gra iṇāsādanādīnāṃ ca saṃyogavibhāgaphalatvātsthāyitve tadāśraye pāvaśyaṃ bhavitavyam/	Though the subject treated of is the Sacrifice, yet the Bhashya has cited an instance of an Action of the nature of Motion, because, even in the Sacrifice, we have such actions in the shape of the throwing of the materials into the fire. That is to say, the mere determination to offer, on the part of the Agent does not accomplish the Result, because the Result is laid down as following from the Action takeu as a complete whole, as made up of all its accessories and appurtenances of procedure and, as a matter of fact, we find that in the body of the Sacrifices, there are such actions as the cutting up of the Cake, the throwing into the fire of the Material, the holding and collecting of the various utensils, &c. and inasmuch as all these actions consist of Conjunctions and Disjunc tions, if they have to last for any length of time, they must have substrates of their own.
na cābhivyaktaṃ rūpamupalabhyate /	And it is such a substrate that we do not find nor is any manifested outward shape perceived.
saṅkalpādīnāmapi saṅkalpāntarāditirodhānānnātra svarūpāvasthānopapattiḥ /	As for the actions of Determina tion also, inasmuch as one Determination is always shrouded over by another Determination, even this cannot have any lasting existence.
avasthānaṃ cātmasamavetasya vā syātpradeyaṃdravyasamavetasya vā /	As for this continuance too, this could be only either as inhering A in the Soul, or B in the materials offered.
na tāvadātmani calanaṃ samavaiti sarvavyāpinaḥ saṃyujyamānaviyujyamānadeśāsambhave calitumasāmarthyāt /	As for the Soul, no motion can inhere in it because being omnipresent, there is no place from which it would be away, or to which it would go and hence it can have no motion.
kathaṃ sarvavyāpitvamasyeti cetsarvatropalabhyamānakāryatvāt /	As for the questionhow can the Soul be omnipresent ?the only reply is that it is so, because we perceive its functioning everywhere.
apratyayena hi caitanyasvabhāvasyātmano 'stitvamātramavagamyate na tu deśataḥ kālato vā viśeṣyate /	That is to say, the notion of I which is all the notion that we have of the Soul always points to the mere existence of the Soul, which is of the nature of pure Consciousness and does not in any way qualify it with any specifications of Time or Place. Consequently, that the existence whereof is not specified by time and place, being held to be eternal and omnipresent, the Soul can not but be accepted as omnipresent.
tataśca /	Or it may be taken as referring to the experi encing of Pleasure, Pain, &c.
anavacchinnasāvaṃ vastu yaddeśakālataḥ /	And we have already shown under the section on Atma in the TarkapaduÇlokavārtika that these experiences do not belong to the Body.
tannityaṃ vibhu cecchantītyātmano vibhuteṣyate	Hence if the Soul were not omnipresent, then sion there would be an experiencing of pleasure, &c., only in such cases where the Body would be in contact with a Place occupied by the Soul.
śarīramātrāntargatātmavādī tvā / nanu ta deva deśāntarādāgamanasya liṅgam / ataśca viruddhacetutvamasyeti /	The upholder of the theory that the Soul is wholly encased within the Body, urges the following The perception of its functioning every where is a sure sign of the Soul having come from one place to another and as such firstly, the reason that you bring forward in support of its ominpresence proves to be contrary to your conclusion.
yadi hi śarīrāiddipi kiṃ cidātmakāyyamupalabhemahi śarīrāntare sukhaduḥkhādīnyā tataḥ sarvagatatvamadhyavasyema/	That is to say, if the functioning of the Soul were actually perceived at all places, at one and the same time, then alone could such perception point to its omnipresence as a matter of fact, however, the said functioning is perceived in different places one after the other and as such the nature of the Soul comes to be similar to that of the Body. That is to say, if we could ever perceive a functioning of the Soul, apart from the Body, or if we could find the pleasure, &c., of one Soul appearing in another body, then alone could we accept the Soul to be omnipresent.
yatastu svaśarīrāntarvaryeva kāryaṃ yatra yatra ca tadgatistatra tatra paryyāyepopalabhyate taccarīrakārthyavadeva tatmahitagatasyopapatsyate/	As it is however, the functioning of the Soul is found only in that Body which it occupies and as such wherever this Body goes, there, one after the other, we come across the said experiences and hence these function ings of the Soul together with the Body becomes in its extension exactly like those of the Body itself.
a nyathā hi śarīramapi sarvagataṃ syā, tasmāccharīravadevāsya tatra tatra gamanāpatteḥ sutarāṃ sakriyatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	Otherwise the Body would also be held to be omnipresent. Thus then movement from one place to another, being found in the soul also, it comes to be as active and mobile as the Body itself.
sandeho vāstu sādhāraṇānai kāntikatvāt /	For instance, it has been declared that the Soul is mixed up with the Body, because it is always in contact with it and because, it is only in such and such places that the function of the Soul is perceived.
āha ca tatrottaraṃ na hyasatyāgamane kiṃ ciddhirudvamiti /	It is in reply to these objections that the Bhashya has said There is nothing incongruous in denying such mobility of the Soul.
yeṣāṃ tu na tu tadeveti pāṭhaḥ teṣāṃ siddhāntavādyeva paryāyeṇa sarvatrātmakāryopacambhanamāgamana liṅgatveṣya viśiṣṭamāśaṅkayottaraṃ vadatīti granthayojanā /	In the aforesaid objectionpassage, some people read na tu tadēva, &c. and in that case, we can take this passage as denying the argu ment that could be brought forward by the opponent,namely, that the perception of its functioning everywhere would point to the Souls moving from one place to the other and then the next sentence gives the grounds for this denial.
kathaṃ punaridamuttaraṃ na hyasatyāgamanaiti / tathā hi pareṇāpi hi śakyaṃ vadituṃ na hi sati gamane kiṃ ciddiruddhamiti / atrābhidhīyate	Objection How can the fact of there being nothing incogruous in denying the movement of the Soul be any reply to the above arguments ? Because the mere absence of incongruity cannot establish any theory specially as such absence of incongruity is equally applicable to the con trary theory as it is equally open to the opponent to say that there s To this, we make the following reply The absence of incongruity being found to be applicable to both theories, the assertion of the Bhashya, that there is nothing incongurous, &c., clearly shows that it means that there is an incongruity in the contrary theory.
parisaṃkhyārūpeṇā satyevāgamane na kiṃ ciddiruddhaṃ sati tu bahu viruddhamityāha /	That is to say, the sense of the reply is that if we deny the motion of the Soul, there is nothing incongruous, while if we accept its motion, there are many incongruities.
tadupavayete	We proceed to show these incongruities.
yadā mūtānāmapi sūkṣmāṇāṃ candrādityaprakāśādīnāṃ na mṛ tpiṇḍādibhiḥ saha mitratvamupapadyate, tannayana vā mayanaṃ, tadā tmanaḥ svabhāvanātyantāmūrttasya jñānasaṃtānasya vā bhūtairmitvaṃ bhavediti kula etat /	The Soul being itself immaterial, it can never be mixed up with material elements and being untouched by these elements, it cannot be taken from one place to another. That is to say, even in the case of extremely subtile particles of matter, such as the light emanating from the Sun or the Moon, we find that they are not mixed up with grosser materials, like lumps of Earth, &c., or are carried about along with these how then can such mixture or movement be postulated with regard to the Soul, which is in its very nature purely immaterial, or a mere series of Ideas as held by the Bauddha? Though the Jaina declares that the Souls in the state of bondage being never found apart from the Body, they can be held to be material,yet such an assertion would involve a vicious circle namely that the fact of the Soul being material would depend upon the fact of its being mixed up with the Body, while this latter fact would depend upon the material nature of the Soul.
ta smāt muktāvasthā nidarśanena ukṣaṇatosyā mūrttatvāt na śarīrasaṃparkanimittamūrttatvasiddhiḥ /	Con sequently, drawing our conclusion from the case of the liberated Souls, we can declare that in its very nature the Soul is immaterial and as such it can have no materiality, based upon the fact of its contact with a material body.
tataśca śarīrādanyaḥ senāsaṃpṛktaścāspatvācca anākṛṣyamāṇaḥ śarīraṃ gacchati tadgatākāśapradeśavadātmā paścānniḥsṛtastatraiva tiṣṭe,nna hi tasya vāyanā pṛthivyādibhirbī preraṇaṃ yena svatantraparaprerito vā gacchen/	Thus then, the Soul being something different from the Body, and not in material contact with it,it cannot, on account of this absence of contact, be carried along with it and hence when the Body would be moving from one place to another, the Soul if an entity limited in space would be left behind, exactly like the portion of space vacated by the moving Body specially as the Soul cannot be wafted along either by Air or by Earth, &c., and as such it is absolutely incapable of being carried about, either by itself or by anything else.
jvālāprabhṛtīnāṃ tu sparśavattvādvāyunā preryamāṇānāmulmukādinā vā nīyamānānāṃ yuktaṃ gamanam /	As for such objects as Flame and the like, inasmuch as these are tangible, they are capable of being carried about by aircurrents, or along with lighted torches, &c., and as such these can move from place to place.
tena kevalaṃ śarīraṃ gacchat acetanaṃ syāt / sarvagatatve tu yatra yatra gamyate tatra tatrātmānusyūtirasti iti yuktā caitanyānuvṛttiḥ /	On the other hand, if the Body were to move about by itself, it would be inanimate when, however, the Soul is omnipresent, wherever the Body goes, it is always endowed with the Soul and hence it is only right that the Body should always be followed by intelligence. And further, in case the Soul be denied to be omnipresent, while occupying the Body, the Soul could be either extremely small as an atom, or of the size of the Body but none of these is possible.
jñānasaṃta tipakṣastāvannirākṛtaḥ /	And we have already shown in the TarkapadaÇlokavārtika that the Soul is not a mere series of Ideas.
tatra nityaḥ sannātmā śarīrābhyantaravarttī	And the Soul being eternal, and located within the Body, if it were extremely small, then it could not extend over the whole Body and in that case, it would be absolutely impossible for us to have any experiences of pleasure or pain, throughout the Body.
stanādhiṣṭhitaḥ tanmātragatānāmeva sukhaduḥkhādīnāmupalabdhiḥ prāpnoti, tamaścaikammin kṣaṇe śiraḥpādavedanānubhavo na syāt /	That is to say, if the Soul is extremely small, then it would be possible to have experiences of pleasure and pain of only that part of the Body, where the Soul would be located and hence it would not be possible, at one and the same time, to have an experience of pain in the head and in the foot. If it be urged that, being extremely mobile, the Soul would swiftly move from one part of the Body to the other, and would thereby make such varied experiences.
atha laghusaṃcāritvāttatra tatropacabhyataityucyate na tatra pramā pāmasti / na ca kālabhedo lakṣyane, anava sthitasyopalabdhikālāsaṃbhavānnaikatrāpyupalabhyeta tasmādakalpaneyam /	possible, then, all that we can say is that there are no grounds for believing in such mobility of the Soul specially as we are not cognisant of any difference in the point of time of the pain in the head and that in the foot and further, if the Soul would be constantly moving, there would be no point of time at which we could afford to have any sensation, and hence there would be no sensation in any part of the Body. Consequently we cannot but reject the offered explanation.
śarīrāvayavānāṃ cāpariśoṣaṇaṃ puṣṭyādi cātmādhiṣṭhitānāṃ bhavati mṛtāvasthāyāṃ viparyayadarśanā, ttatra ya evāvayavastenotsṛṣṭaḥ sa eva mṛtavacchuṣye,datha śarīraparimita āpaṇābhyupagamyate tatrāpi bar̤a dṛṣṭaṃ kalpanīyam	And again, the various limbs of the Body are strengthened, and do not wither away, simply because of their being pervaded over by the Soul because at death we find that they wither away quickly. Hence, if the Soul were something very small, that point of the Body, wherefrom it would be absent, would be liable to instant decay. On the other hand, if the Soul were to be assumed to be of the exact size of the Body, as held by the Jaina, then too it would be necessary to make many gratuitous assumptions. For instance, we would have to make the following assumptions that the Soul has many parts that these parts are innumerable that without any other agency, there is a conglomeration of these parts that even though partite, the Soul is eternal that the Soul is capable of the very extremes of expansion and contraction that the Soul has a motion from one body to another, on death that there is a point of time intervening between its departure from one body and the occupation of another and that there is some cause for such motion of the Soul.
sarve hyavayavasadbhāvādayaḥ pratyakṣādyaviṣayāḥ santa utprekṣāmātrekarūyante te śavdavacceca pi pratyākhyeyāḥ /	All the above assumptionsthe existence of the Souls parts, &c. are such as are not at all amenable to Senseperception, &c. and as such they could at best be only the creations of ones imagination, &c. and as such they should be rejected, in the same mauner as we have rejected under the chapter on Words the assumption of parts of words.
śarīramācāvadhikānāṃ caiṣāmutprekṣitu mapyānantyamaśakyaṃ na caiṣāṃ dravatvādinā vina kaścitsaṃśleṣa heturvidyane / na cāsaṃśliṣṭānā mekajīvārambhasāmardhyam/	Then again, when the Soul is only as large as the Body, we can never assume its parts to be innumerable or endless and in the absence of any fluidity in these parts, it is not possible for them to conglomerate together in one compact whole and unless they conglomerate thus, they can have no power of bringing into existence a single living being.
sarvasaṃyogānāṃ ca viyogāvinābhūtatvād ghaṭāditulya kadā cijjīvasya pradhvaṃso bhavet /	And further even if such conglomerations were possible, all Conjunction always ending in Disjunction, the living Soul would be, exactly like a jar, amenable to occa sional destruction.
gātracchede ca tadarttināṃ jovāvayavānāṃ tato niḥstyāvaśiṣṭe śarīrabhāge punaḥ praveśa ityetadapramāṇakam / yattu viyojitamātrāṇāṃ istādīnāṃ sphuraṇaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ, tada bhighāta preritavāyunimittamiti na tāvatā jīvākyavānuganirvijñāyate /	And when one part of the part has been cut off, there is no ground for assuming that the particles of the Soul, that were con tained in that limb, escape from it when severed from the Body, and spread themselves over the rest of the Body. And as for the temporary mobility perceived in the severed limb, this is due to the momentum imparted by the severing stroke to the air enclosed within it, and not to the presence in it of any Soulparticles.
tathā sati saṃkocavikāsāveteṣāṃ bhavata ityatra tantravārtike /	Because in that case, there could be no ground for believing in any expansion or contraction of these particles.
dīpaprabhāprabhṛtīnāṃ tu kathaṃ citpratyavyatvādupapadyete /	As for the light emanating from the lamp, its expansion or contraction is held to be possible, because we actually perceive such contraction and expansion.
na ca pradīpaprabhāyāḥ saṃkoco bhavati bharāvādikādane śeṣaprabhāvināśādanāvṛtā hi jvālā S'tmasamīpe prabhāmaṇḍalamārabdhaṃ samarthā nācchāditā / etenaiva ca vikāso 'pi pratyuktaḥ anyaeva hyavayavāstatra pracīyamānā vistāraṃ janayanti na tāvatāmeva vikāsaḥ /	Though in reality, there is no contraction of the light of the lamp because even when the lamp is covered up by an opaque vessel, all the light outside the cover is destroyed because the flame is cap able of emitting a circle of light round itself, only when it is uncovered, and not when it is covered up. The same arguments hold respecting the expansion of such lights the fact being that the apparent expansion of light is due to the appearance of new particles of light, added to one another, and not to the expansion of the former particles themselves. It is only in the case of such things as are tangible and solid that one cannot take the place occupied by another and hence, when a number of such things appear, they form a gradually expanding series, which gives an idea of expansion.
kathaṃ caikamya jīvasya putikā hastagarīraparimitā saṃkocavi kāsau yujyete / maraṇakāle cāntarābhavaśarīrasaṃcaraṇaṃ taccāsti kena citpratibandhena sadapi na gṛhyate, tena ca śarīrāntare jīvaniśśepa ityādi niṣpramāṇakam /	The particles of Soul however are immaterial and as such there being nothing impossible in all of them occupying the same point in space, they would ever remain in the condition of an atom how soever much their number might increase. How too, is it possible for the particles of the same Soul to expand or contract within the limits of the Body of an elephant or an insect which the Soul inhabits during different lives on the Earth? And further, this theory would necessitate many such groundless assumptionsas that at death the Soulparticles move into an intermediate body,that such an intervening body exists, that though existing this body is not perceived, on account of certain obstacles in the way of such perceptionand that this intervening body throws the Soul into the next body born into the world after some time.
tasmātsarvagatatvam /	For these reasons we must accept the Soul to be omnipresent.
yattu gyāmākataṇḍulamātrādipradarśanamupaniṣatsu tākyāntarapradarśita vibhutvasyaiva sataḥ svakṣmagrahaṇagocaratvāt /	As for the declaration in the Upanishads that the Soul is of the size of a grain of corn, &c., &c.,it is only meant to show the extreme subtility of the Soul, which has been elsewhere declared to be omnipresent.
yadapi dvaipāyanenoktam /	As for the assertion in the Mahabharata Vanaparva Adh.

tathā hi tenaiva gītādiṣu anekaprakāraṃ savaigatatvaṃ varṇitam/	And we actually find the same Vyasa speaking, in many places in the Bhagavadgita, of the omnipresent character of the Soul.
nanu ca sarvagatatve vyomavatsarvaśarīreṣveka evātmā prāpnoti/ naiṣa doṣaḥ /	Objection If the Soul be omnipresent, a single Soul would belong to all bodies. Reply It is not so because we actually find the bodies to be many, and each body to be endowed with distinct experiences of its own. If it were not so, all purposes of the world being fulfilled by a single body, there would be no use of a number of bodies.

None of these absurdities appear, if Souls are held to be many and even though all these Souls are omnipresent, there would be nothing incongruous in their simultaneous existence inasmuch as being imma terial, none of them would stand in the way of another.
sarveṣāmapi ca sarvagatatve mūrtirahitatvātmamānadeśavṛyavirodhaḥ /	And it is on account of this indivisibility of souls, and also on account of all Souls being of the nature of pure Consciousness, that the Upanishads speak of all terial, Souls as one.
kathaṃ punarjñānātve 'pi sarveṣāṃ sarvaśarīraiḥ saṃbandhādanyadīyasukhaduḥkhādyanupalabdhiḥ/	Question How is it that, the Souls being many and omnipresent, and all of them being related to all bodies, the pleasure or pain of one being is not experienced by another ?.
ke cittāvadāhuḥ śarīrapariṇātmavādino 'pi kincāyaṃ tulyo doṣastasyāpi garbhātma samānadeśatvānmāśejñastadgatāni sukhādīnyapalabheta /	To this question, some people make the following reply Even when the Soul is held to be nothing more than the Body, just as the pleasure, &c., of the Soul encased in the body of the child in the womb are not expe rienced by the mother,so, the same would be the case with the case in question. That is to say, even one who holds the Soul to be of the same size as the Body, would be open to the above objection inasmuch as the Soul of the mother inhabits the same body that is also inhabited by the Soul of the child in her womb, the pleasure, &c., of the child would be experienced by the mother.
tatra yastasya parihāraḥ sa sarvātmanāṃ sarvaśarīreṣu bhaviṣyatotyadoṣaḥ /	And the explanation that would be brought forward in this case would also apply to the case in question.
yadyatropapattirucyeta na tu parapakṣamā myāpattirevopapatti, stasya ca tava cobhayorapyanyena parthyanuyogāt/	The above reply might hold good, if some reasons were brought for ward as it is, however, the mere fact of the amenability of the contrary theory to the same objection, cannot be counted as a reason in support of ones own theory because a third party could effectively bring forward the said objection against both of these theorists.
antaḥ śarīrākāśe bāhyavadevātmano 'nabhyupragama/nnaiva garbhaśarīreṇa mātṛkṣetrajñasya prāptirasti yena tudoṣatā sthāna /	And further, the Soul being a modification of the organ of touch, and the position of the Soul in the space within the Body not being accepted as that of something apart. from it, there is no contact of the Soul of the mother with the childs body and as such the said objection would not apply in this case.
tasmādevaṃ pariharttavyama yadi hyātmanaḥ sukhādīnāṃ ca samānadeśalakṣaṇa eva saṃbandha upabhogakāraṇamidhyeta tatoyaṃ doṣaḥ syāt /	For these reasons, the above question should be answered in the following manner The absurdity urged in the question would apply to our theory, only if mere spatial contact were held to be the sole ground of the experiencing of pleasure, &c. as a matter of fact, however, we have an experience of only such pleasures, &c., as are capable of being experienced and as such there is no room for the said absurdity.
iha tu cakṣurādīnāmiva kṣetrajñayogyatālakṣaṇaḥ saṃbadha, stana yathaiva tvagindriyeṇa sparśasamānadeśānāmapi rūpāḍhīnāmagrahaṇam, evamanyenātmanānyadīyadharmmādharmmopāttasakhaduḥkhādyagrahaṇam/	That is to say, if, in the Souls experiencing of pleasure, &c., the sole cause were held to be the mere coexistence in space, then we would be open to the said objection as a matter of fact, however, as in the case of the eye, &c., so in the case in question also, the cause of experience is held to lie in the capability of the Soul. Consequently just as even though the colour of an object is existent in space with its touch, yet it is not perceived by the sense of Touch, so in the case in question also, one Soul does not experience the pleasure and pain brought about by the Dharma or Adharma of another Soul.
tasmādātmavādoktakhasvābhibhāvavyavasthānādadoṣaḥ/	Thus then, the relationship between the experiencer and the experienced being that of ownership,as explained under the chapter on Atmaour theory is not open to the said objection.
evaṃ sarvagatatvātsivamātmano niśca latvam /	Thus then, the Soul being omnipresent, it must be admitted that it can have no mobility and as such the Actions cannot inhere in it. Nor could the Action inhere in the materials such as the pieces.
tadvinaṣṭamiti /	of the Cakebecause, says the Bhashya, such materials are always destroy ed.
na ca tasyāvināśaḥ tadviparīta dravyāntaropannambhāt /	Nor can this destruction be denied because we actually find that the cake that has been offered into the fire has become transformed into ashes. in the perception of the materials, in their own forms for the simple reason that there are no such obstacles.
athārthāpatyā gra haṇapratibandhādi kalpyeta tathā'pi satyapūrvāhahunaramadṛṣṭaṃ dṛṣṭaviparītaṃ ca kalpayitavyaṃ tāvada vinaṣṭamāste/	Even if such obstacles were assumed on account of the apparent inconsistency of the nonpercep tion, then too, we would have to assume many more groundless and absurd imperceptible things than the single Apurva.
tathā kṣaṇikasya karmmaṇaḥ sthānamanupalavdhikāraṇaṃ ca kalpyamityatigauravam /	For instance, we would have to assume the continuation of the material in its un destroyed form that it is not perceived even though existing the existence of obstacles to such perception that there are obstacles to the perception of the obstacles, and so on and on ad infinitum the continuation of the action which is momentary and the reason for the nonperception of this action.
evamanāśritakamrmāvasthāna kalpanāyām /	These would be the arguments against the assumption of the continua tion of the Action, independent of any substrate.
athātmāśritameva saṃyogavibhāgāvakurvadāsīt tatrāpi dvaṣṭaviparyayādṛṣṭakalpane sthānām/	If however it be held that the action is contained in the Soul itself, bringing about certain definite conjunctions and disjunctions, this also would involve the contradiction of a directly perceptible fact, and the as sumption of one not perceptible.
tasmādaramapūrvakalpana meveti siḍūṃ mūnādhikaraṇaprayojanam /	And hence we conclude that it is by far the most reasonable process to assume the agency of the Apūrva.

In case, however, the Result is directly related to the Action, the use of the material is a visible one, lying in the mere accomplishment of the Action and as such its place could very well be taken by a substitute, which is known to be capable of serving the same visible purpose.

naimittikaphalāya vā pravṛtasya karmaṇaḥ siddhyarthamiti /	Nor can these materials be spoken of as substitutes of the orginal material because they are not similar to it, and because they serve an entirely different purpose because the original material was being employed towards the fulfilment of a particular transcendental result, while the material now taken up is used either with a view to ward off the sin accruing from the noncompletion of the sacrifice, or to complete an action which is being performed for the sake of a minor result.
nāmadheyasiddhirapi prayojanameva/	Another use of this Adhikarana lies in connection with the ascer taining of the Names of Sacrifices and we have already explained this under Namadheya Adh.
sā ta pūrvoktatvānna pradarśitā ākhyātatvāviśeṣeṇa bhūtairbhavyārthajanmanaḥ /	Sutra Actions are of two kindsthe Primary and the Subsidiary. It would seem from the above that there is always an Apūrva in connection with each distinct Verb consequently the Author now proceeds to differentiate the Subsidiary from the Primary Actions which latter alone are followed by an Apūrva.
siddhe ca sādhyatāśaktaḥ sarvākhyātapradhānatā nāmākhyātārthasaṃbandhe yadaklṛptaprayojanam /	All verbs having the common character of a verb, inasmuch as the potency of the objective, proceeding from the object to be accomplished, is always brought about by fully accomplished objects, the actions de noted by all verbs are equally Primary. That is to say, so long as a definite purpose can be assumed, it is only right that every action, being expressed by a verb, should be accepted as serving a distinctly useful purpose, and as such, being Primary, and the means of bringing about an Apurva.
tasyādṛṣṭārthatā yuktā netarasyāpramāṇikā	And as such the threshing must bring about an Apurva.

That is to say, in all cases where a certain Action is related to a certain material, inasmuch as no Action can be accomplished without a certain material, the Material, being in the first instance found to bring about the Action, is at once taken as serving the distinctly visible purpose of accomplishing the Action. Subsequently, however, in certain cases, the Action turns upon itself, and imparts an aid to the material itself as in the case of Threshing which serves to purify the corn while in other cases, the Action rests within itself, its sole purpose lying in its own fulfilment as in the case of sacrificing.

In that case, how ever, where the Action is found to have its sole purpose in the fulfilment of a visible purposesuch as the preparation of Rice for instance,v can have no business to assume any transcendental purpose and the Injunction of the Action having been justified by a visible purpose, the Action is not recognised as bringing about any transcendental result.
naitadevam / dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	. Sutra Those that do not seek to make a material, are Primary Actions because the material is a secondary factor.

tatra pūrvapakṣavādī pūrvoktenaiva yaidravyaṃ na cikīrghya ityanena pradhānakarmmalakṣaṇenāca dravyeṇa niṣpāditaṃ kammaṃ na kiṃ cittasya pratyupakurva dṛśyate /	Objection When, as a matter of fact, we find that, whether the Action be one that leads to transcendental results, or one that brings about only visible ones, it is performed equally well, what is the use of differentiating them into the Primary and the Subsidiary? Reply Without the aforesaid differentiation, we would have the following anomalies In accordance with the theory of the Purvapaksha of Adhi. , even where the material to be offered is the rice of the Priyangu, the threshing, which would be necessary for the preparation of the Priyangu, would come to be applied to the Vrihi corn because according to that theory the threshing also is a Primary Action and as such the material mentioned along with it viz the Vrihi could not set aside the Subsidiary material just as in the case of the Butter in connection with the Prayājas and consequently the threshing could not be removed from the Vrihi.
tasmātpradhānakarmma saṃmārgaprokṣaṇādīti anyataḥ siddhaśeṣāṇāṃ yeṣāṃ dṛṣṭopakāritā /	Whereas in accordance with the Siddhanta, the Subsidiary materials would be set aside because the material that is of use in the Primary Action, is affected by the preparatory actions also and hence the Priyangu corn to be used at the sacrifice, would certainly have to undergo all the processess of threshing, washing, &c.
teṣāṃ nāpūrvamastīti intyādīnāmudāhṛtiḥ	could not be applied to the Vrihi corn, which is not taken up by the Principal Action.
tannāma pramāṇaṃ yuktaṃ yadekāntikam /	Nor, in the present instance, is there any authority for taking up the original action because the Context does not serve to make any such distinction.
anaikāntikī ca prādhānye dvitīyā, guṇabhūtadravyopadeśe'pi hṛṣṭatvātmaktūn juhotīti /	Nor could a differentiation be made on the ground of the fact of that person alone being entitled to the threshing who is entitled to the per formance of the DarçaPurnamāsa because of the reasons propounded under Sutra IXi.
tathā prayājaśeṣeṇa havīṃṣyabhidhārayatītyantareṇāpi dvitīyāmājyaprādhānyaṃ dṛṣṭam / ato śrīnavantītyatrobhayasaṃbhave 'pyupakāradarśanakṛtameva dravyaprādhānyam /	And on account of the peculiarties of the context, the threshing would also come to form part of such sacrifices as the Sānnayya and the Upañçu, &c., as also in the various modifications of these because it would have only a transcendental effect, and as such there would be nothing incongruous in its employment in all these actions. Sutra “In the case of all Dharmas, every Action would be the Primary, because of the nonfulfilment of anything visible exactly as in the case of the Pryāja.” The Bhashya has cited the cleanings of the Sruk, the Paridhi, the Agni and the Purodaça,because each of these is differently related to the Principal Action.
na ca tatsaṃmāgaṃprokṣaṇādiṣvastīti ihāpidvitīyayā dravyamevopadiśyatāmiti /	The sense of the Adhikarana is that even when the aid imparted by a substance to the Primary Actions is from a distance, inasmuch as it is connected with a certain Action, the Substance cannot attain the position of the Primary.
na tadarthatvāllokavattasya ca śeṣabhūtatvāt	The differentia of the Subsidiary action is not that it should seek to make a substance because it is distinctly shown in Adh.
tiṣṭhatu tāvatprayogaḥ / kiṃ kāraṇam	Question Why then should the Sutra have brought forward the fact of the action seeking to make a material ? Reply The actions of threshing, &c., have been cited only with a view to show that there is no Apūrva in the case of those Actions, which have been proved to have the character of the Çesha i.e., being for the sake of other Actions and which are found to serve distinctly visible purposes.
yadi hyācārasyaikarūpyaṃ bhavennaiva smṛtayaḥ prayatnena dhāran /	That is to say, in a case where the Subsidiary character depends upon the fact of the action seeking to make a substance, we should not recognise any distinct Apurva.
sa eva tu saṃkīrṇatvādasphuṭaḥ smaraṇena pratipācyate /	The Purvapakshi, however, runs away with the idea that this is the sole definition of the Subsidiary Action and hence not finding it applicable to such actions as the said Cleaning, &c., he has concluded that these are Primary Actions..
smaryateca dvitīyāyāḥ prādhānyamarthaḥ /	But the sense of the Siddhanta is that it is only when the fact of one Action being for the sake of another has been ascertained by means of Direct Assertion, &c., that we can find it actually serving a visible purpose, or in the absence of any such visible purposewe can assume a transcen dental result to follow from it.
‘karmmaṇi dvitīyā' 'kartturīkṣitatamaṃ karme’ti / tathā lokavedayoḥ prayujyate ghaṭaṃ karoti brījīnavaintīti /	Thus then, the fact of the action of threshing, &c., being subservient to another Action, having been indicated by the Accusative caseending in Vrihin by means of its signification of the predominance of the material, denoting, as it does, that which is the most desired to be accomplished, the action of threshing is found to serve a visible purpose and thus it has all its requirements fulfilled.
yāni ca loka vyabhicārāśaṅkāsthānāni tānyudāharati /	Though such is not the case with the aforesaid Cleaning, &c., which, for this very reason, are held to serve transcendental purposes.
taṇḍulānodanaṃ paca balbajān śikhaṇḍakān kuru tasantravārtike/	yet that does not in any way deprive them of the character of Çesha, or subserviency, which has been previously ascertained by means of Direct Assertion, &c.
paḍunānadya jur̤adhoti / taṇḍulairbalvajairiti ca prayoktavye yā dvitīyā prayujyate tannūnaṃ tṛtīyā samānārthā seti gamyate /	because it is found along with even such materials, as are distinctly laid down as subsidiariese.g., the ending in Saktūn in the sentence Saktūn juhōti and similarly we find the Predominance of the Ajya, even when it is not accompained by the Accusative endinge.g., iu the sentence prayājaçēshēņa ajyena havinshyabhigharayati. Consequently we conclude that in the case of the sentence Vrīhinavahanti, though both characters are possible, yet, we conclude that the material Vrīhi has the primary character, because of the fact of its imparting a distinct aid, and because of the Accusative ending.
tatrocyate	therefore in the case of these also i.e.
yadā padārthāntarabhūtaudanaśikhaṇḍakrasādhanatvena taṇḍujabalvajā vivacyante tadā tṛtīyāntapadabhājo bhavanti /	in the sentence Sruvam sammārshti, the Accusative ending must be taken as only laying down the material and having nothing to do with its predominance.
guṇabhūte 'pyarthe kena ci tkāraṇena kaścitprādhānyāṃśo vivacyate tathā pradhānabhūteṣu guṇāṃśaḥ /	L Sutra Then the Reply is It is not so because it the Action is for the sake of that material just as in ordinary life specially as that Action is subservient. Let the question of usage rest awhile because the usage of words being mere usage is always set aside by the more authoritative Smrti Rules of Grammar because the manner of expressing ones thoughts is multifarious while the Rule is ever one and definite.
na ca yadvivacyate ta cchabdenā bhidhātavyamityasti pramāṇaṃ, vivakṣāsaṃpattyarthaṃ tu lakṣaṇādyupāyāntarāśrayaṇaṃ na svārthatyāgaḥ / tasmātprādhānyameva dvitīyārthaḥ /	That is to say, if the usage were always of one uniform kind, then there would be no necessity of collecting and preserving the Smrti Rules. As it is, however, usage is so confused that it can hardly be found in a definite form and hence it is that right usage is preserved by means of Smrti Rules. And these Rules distinctly lay down that the Accusa tive ending denotes predominance Vide Pāṇinis Sutras IIiii and Iiv and it is in accordance with these rules that we have such sentences as ghatam karoti in ordinary parlance and Vrihinavahanti in the Veda.
kathaṃ tu sakkādiṣu guṇatvamiti /	The Bhashya next proceeds to cite such instances met with in ordinary parlance, as appear to be against the said rules Tandulan danam paca, Valvajän çikhandakan kuru, Tandulānādāya juhudhi.
taducyate	We proceed to explain these apparent anomalies.
dvitīyā tāvatkarmatvaṃ pradhāna rūpamātmaśaktyā vadati tatvica bannavratā kāraṇāntareṇa virudhyamānatvānnāśrīyate / tena tū kāraka viśeṣātmakatvādyatkārakamāmānyamavinābhūtaṃ ucyate tada dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda / viruddhatvādvivacyate/	In all matters relating to cooking, the Rice, &c., have a twofold form the Primary and the Subsidiary and it is in consideration of the Primary form that we have the Accusative ending in tandulan, &c.. That is to say, when the Rice is spoken of as the means of accomplishing something else, in the shape of the cooked rice, or the straw as that of bringing about something else in the shape of the bundle,then alone are these to be used with the Instrumental ending when, however, the Rice is spoken of as itself being modified into the form of the cooked rice, in order to be capable of being eaten, or the straw itself being changed into the bundle, with a view to keep it soft,or after the rice has been found to be laid down in the Veda as an accessory in the Agnihotra sacrifice, when it so happens that the wife of the sacrificer has prepared some exceptionally fine rice, then, either with a view to show off her own excellent work, or with a view to the special result strength that is said to follow if the Rice is offered at the sacrifice, she addressing the sacrificer might say, Sir, make an offering of rice today,in all these cases the words come to take the Accusative ending.
tatraitāvānartho vijñāyate homasya kārakaṃ saktava iti /	And it is a wellknown fact, that in ordinary parlance people always seek to speak of the same thing in many ways.
na ca sāmānya nirviśeṣa vyavahārakṣamamiti viśeṣāpeśśāyāṃ karaṇatvaṃ bhaviṣyati / dravyāṇāṃ karmmasaṃyogaiti bhūtabhavyamamuccāraṇanyāyāt /	Nor is there any authority for holding that the idea that is desired to be conveyed must be accepted as directly expressed by the words used. Because for the purpose of meeting the wishes of the speaker we have at our command such indirect means of expression, as Indication and the like and hence no abandoning of the original meanings of words is justifiable.
kathaṃ punaḥ saktuprādhānya vivakṣā viru dhyate / tatrāha yasya hi dravyasya va cidupayogo nirvṛtto bhaviṣyatīti vā 'vadhārthyate tatsaṃskārāītvātkarmma prati prādhānyaṃ pratipadyate /	Consequently we conclude that the Accusative really ex presses predominance only. Question How is it then that in the sentence the Accusative is found to denote subservience ? Reply In that case also, the Accusative by itself expresses predomi nance only but this being found to be incompatible with the rest of the sentence, we accept it to indicate its correlative, subserviency. That is to say, by its own natural potency, the accusative always expresses the objective, in the character of the predominant but this natural meaning is found, in the sentence in question, to be incompatible with something more authoritative and as such it cannot be admitted then, finding that the character of the Karaka or caserelation is also indicated by the Accusative, as its invariable concomitant, we accept this indicated meaning of the Accusative, as not incompatible with the rest of the sentence which thus comes to mean that the Saktu has something to do with the accomplishment of the Homa.
yatpunarnopayuktaṃ nopayocyate vā tasya saṃskāro niṣprayojana iti tadvidhānavākyānarthakyaprasaṅgaḥ /	been utilised in some way, or which is to be utilised at some future time, is capable of any process of purification and as such it attains a predomi nance with reference to the Action. And when the substance concerned is such as has never been utilised, not is going to be utilised, any purification of that would be absolutely useless and hence any injunction of such preparation would be wholly purposeless.
tecāmo saktavo na homātprāgupayujyante nova~ bhamma mādbhāvādbhasma viniyogavacanābhāvācca /	The Saktu in question is such that it is never used before the Homa, nor can it be used after it, having been turned into ashes specially as there is no Injunction as to any such ashes of Saktu being used.
tasamastaṃ vākyamanarthakaṃ bhavata dvitīyā vā lakṣaṇa /	Under the circumstance, the only alternatives that we have are that the whole sentence is absolutely useless, or that the Accusative is to be taken in its indirect sense. And the authority of the Veda having been an established fact, there can be no hesitation in accepting the second alternative.
mukhyārthaprayogo dyotsargikatvādapavādadarśanena bhrāntitvaṃ pratipadyate / sarvatraiva lakṣaṇāśrayaṇamānarthakyaprasaṅganimittam /	It is a common fact that the direct meaning of a word is always set aside as mistaken, whenever it is faced by such exceptional circumstances of incompatibility. And the acceptance of the indirect meaning of a word is always due to the necessity of avoiding the uselessness of the sentence otherwise if there were no such uselessness, it would be always possible to accept the original direct signification of the word.
tena virodhātmaktu sādhanakahoma vidhānaṃ prakaraṇasaṃbandhi gṛhyate /	It is for these reasons that we accept the sentence in question to be an Injunction of a Homa with the Saktu as the necessary material.such an Injunction being in keeping with the Context in which it occurs.
nanu saktūnāmapi iti homavantaḥ saktatropi jyotiṣṭomasyopakṛtyārthavanto bhavivyantītyāha /	The Bhashya puts the question The Saktu being mentioned in the context, it would naturally follow that it is of some distinct use in the sacrifice. And the sense of this is that the Saktu offered in the Homa would be distinctly useful, iuasmuch as it helps the Jyotishtoma sacrifice, in whose context the said sentence occurs.
siddhāntavādī tu chanjena homasādhanībhūtānāme vārthavattvamabhyupagacchati ko vā brūne neti /	The Siddhanti in the Bhashya makes a dodge, and retorts Who says it is not so?his meaning being that the said usefulness be longs to the Saktu as the material offered in the Homa. In all cases, we find that for all substances, there is no other use save the accomplish ment of the Action connected with the sentence in which the name of that substance occurs because they have no connection with the procedure of the action.
yathā homaḥ kriyātmakatvātkimityapekṣamāṇaḥ pradhānakathaṃbhātantravārtika /	That is to say, the Homa, being of the nature of an Action, stands in need of something to be accomplished by it and consequently along with the principal procedure, it is taken as forming the process of action helping in the said accomplishment.
venetya manugrā cakatvena gṛhyate naivaṃ dravyam /	This, however, cannot be said of the Substance.
na ca tasmādadṛṣṭakarūpanā kriyānirvarttyatvādapūrvāṇām /	Nor can the Substance alone justify the assumption of anything transcendental because all transcendental results are brought about by Actions alone.
yatrāpi tāvad dravyaṃ sājhātphalāya caudyate yathā godohanena paśukāma iti tatrāpyanyaprayojanakriyādvāramantareṇa nāpūrvaṃ bhaviṣyati /	Even in a case where a substance itself is laid down as leading to a particular result,e.g., in the Injunction one should sacrifice with the milking vessel for one who desires cattle,no Apurva would be possible, except through the agency of some other Action, though having a different end.
kimuna yadā na kasya cidaṅgatvena saktavaḥ śrūyante / na ca kiṃ citkalpanāpramāṇamasti /	Under the circumstances, how can any such assertion be made with reference to the Saktu, which is not found to be enjoined with regard to any particular result? Nor is there any authority for making such an assumption.
na hītyuttaram / dvitīyā hi saktūnāṃ prādhānyaṃ vadantī homaṃ tadarthaṃ kuryyānna saktubhyo 'pūrvamiti pravipattim /	As for the Accusative in Saktūn, this cannot serve as an authority for any such assumption because what the Accusative does is to directly express the predominance of the Saktu and as such it would point to the fact of the Homa being for the sake of the Saktu, and not to that of a certain Apūrva following from the Saktu.
tena dvitīyāprasādādbhaveḍḍomaḥ sakkarthaḥ /	Thus then, through the help of the Accusative the Homa would be for the sake of the Saktu.
kathaṃ nāma homavyāptāḥ saktavaḥ syuriti / nānyammai prayojanā yā śravaṇa /	How could the Homa be pervaded over by the Saktu? Because it could not serve any other purpose,no such other use being mentioned.
te cāmo bhavanti home kute saktavo homasambadvā iti prāgeva prayojanalābhātparthyavasitā dvitīyā niṣprayojaneṣvapi, homaṃ prati prādhānyamātreṇa karmmatva siddheḥ /	Thus then, it is only when the Homa has been performed that the Saktu becomes related to the Homa and hence before the purpose has been served, the Accusative has had its end hence even in the case of the useless Saktu, the Accusative becomes justified, in consideration of its predominance.
tatra siddhe vākyārthe paścānna puruṣasya kratorvopayujyantaiti jñātvā tadvacanādvā'dṛṣṭaṃ kalpyeta prādhānyajñānaṃ vā bhrāntiriti /	And thus the meaning of the sentence having been accomplished, the Saktu could not be of any subsequent use, either to the Person or to the Sacrifice and having recognised this fact, we could either assume a transcendental result, on the strength of the sentence in question, or accept the notion of predominance as expressed by the Accusative to be a misconception.
tatrāi /	And hence the only reasonable course left is to take the Accusative in its indirect sense of the Instrumental.
na tadvacanācchakyamanyatkalpayitumiti/	It is in con sideration of these facts that the Bhashya has saidthe sentence cannot justify any assumption of the transcendental Apūrva.
tataśva tṛtīyārthasiddiriti matvā mahābhāṣyakāreṇoktaṃ tṛtīyāyāḥ sthāne dvitīyeti /	It is in consideration of this fact that the author of the Mahabhāshya has declared The Accusative is used in place of the Instrumental.
tena vaiṣamyaṃ homasaṃmārgayoḥ, saktūnāṃ niṣprayojanatvena tadarthatvātpuroḍāmādeśvānyaśeṣabhāvena parthyagnikaraṇa/disaṃskārāītvāt /	Thus then, we find that there is a diversity between the Homa and the aforesaid Cleaning. Because the Saktu having no other purpose to serve, it is taken to be for the sake of the Homa while such substances as the Cake and the like, inasmuch as they are subservient to something else, are capable of such purificatory actions as their being circled round by fire.
dṛḍhe ca śāstrārthe 'vasthite dṛṣṭopakārābhāve'pyadṛṣṭa kalpanā bhaviṣyati /	When the true meaning of the scripture has been got at, it is only when we do not find any visible use, that we assume a transcendental result.
loke'pyadṛṣṭārthāḥ saṃskārā ācārādgamyanta yathā gra/māntarādāgatānāṃ śāntyarthamagninnavaṇadadhyaścataprabhṛteḥ śirasa uparibhrāmaṇaṃ śacideśapratiṣṭhāpanaṃ ca /	And even in ordinary life, we find certain purificatory rites being kept up by usage with the sole purpose of something transcendental for instance, when a man returns from a journey, fire, salt, &c., are moved round his head, with a view to the pacifying of all evil influences impending over him.
na cāsyānupapattirācāraprāmāṇyāt /	Nor can the fact of such rites bringing about something transcen dental be denied because the performance of these is based upon the authority of wellestablished usage.
tenādṛṣṭārthānāmapi tulyaśrutitvātmiko guṇabhāvaḥ /	Thus then, we find that even those that lead to something trans cendental have a subordinate character, because of the uniformity of assertion.
nanvevaṃ sati sarvatra prayojanavattā kṛtameva dravyaprādhānyamiti na vaktavyaṃ dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Objection Such being the case, in all cases the predominance of the substance would depend upon the fact of its serving a useful purpose and hence it is not right to sayon account of the uniformity of assertion.
mulya śrutitvāditi, darśayitavye vā yatra prayojanavattā nirapekṣaṃ dvitīyākṛtameva prādhānyaṃ kevalaṭatīyākṛto vā guṇabhāva iti /	Or else, it should be shown how, independently of any useful purposes served, predominance is denoted solely by the Accusa tive or, how the subordinate character is denoted solely by the Instrumental.
prādhānyaṃ tāvadaindryā gāīpatyamupatiṣṭhataityatra liṅgādindrārthatvāvagateḥ gāīpatyaikavākyatvācca tātmādhana kendropasthānaprasaṅge kevala dvitīyākṛtameva gāīpatyaprādhānyam /	Reply As for an instance of predominance expressed solely by the Accusative, we have it in the case of the sentence Aindrya garhapatyamu patishthate, where the indirect implication of the name Aindri shows that the mantra in question is addressed to Indra and then on account of its being mentioned along with the garhapatya. If this garhapatya be taken only as the means of worshipping Indra, then the Accusative ending in it would be absolutely out of place and hence it is only on the strength of the Accusative ending that we admit the Garhapatya to be the pre dominant factor in the sentence. Similarly, as for an instance of the s sub servient character being expressed solely by the Instrumental, we have it in the case of the sentence Suktavākēna prastaram where though both the Süktavāka and the prastara are equally useful, yet on account of the Instrumental ending, the former is taken as subservient to the latter.
tathā sūkta vākena prastara mityubhayoḥ prayojanavattvāviśeṣe kevalaḍhatīyākṛ sūktabākasya prastarapraharaṇāṅgatvaṃ tena vibhaktibhirevāṅgāṅgibhāve 'bhidhīyamāne niṣprayojanatvamapavādo na tu prayojanasadasadbhāvenāṅgāṅgitvamiti vivekaḥ / prayojanaṃ tvadhikaraṇasya na samyaganumanyante /	Thus then, the comparative predominance or subserviency being expressed by the caseendings themselves, all that uselessness does is to form an exception to the former general rule and the usefulness.or uselessness of any object can never be taken as the sole ground of differen tiating the said predominance or subservience. The purposes of the present Adhikarana that are enumerated in the Bhashya are not quite acceptible in the way therein put forward for the following reasons In the sentence Çamimayyah scrucah the fact of being made of Cami wood has been laid down with reference to all Sruks.
tathā hi	But according to the Purvapaksha, as also according to the Siddhanta, that qualification is recognised as applying to the Primary as also to the subsidiary sacri fices.
hyutpattivākyā kevala pradhānārthatvena jñāyamānā yuktaṃ yadaṅgeṣu na bhavantoti /	As for the Priyangu corn, the original Injunction distinctly lays it down as for the sole purpose of the Primary sacrifice and as such it is only proper that it is not employed in the subsidiaries.
śamīmayatvādi tu srugādimātrānuvādena vidhīyamānaṃ sarveṣāṃ vā śeṣatvasyātatprayuktatvā dityanena vākyasaṃyogabalīyastvātprakaraṇagamya pradhānārthatvabādhenāṅgapradhānārthaṃ vijñāyate /	as applying both to the Primary and the Subsidiary, and not to the Primary alone, as shown by the Context which is a much weaker authority. Nor do we find any qualifying clause, which would point out the Sruk as the one that is employed in the Primary Sacrifice and even if there were such a clause, as it would only be a qualifying adjunct of the subject of the sentence, no significance could be attached to it. Therefore in ac cordance with the Purvapaksha also, it is clear that the Sruk of Çami wood appertains to all Primary Sacrifices, as also to all the Cleaning, &c., that help the Sacrifice from a distance transcendentally and as such there would be no chance of there being any cleaning of the Sruk made up of many woods.
na cātra viśeṣaṇaṃ kiṃ cidupāttaṃ yena pradhānaga tasrugādimātrapratītiḥ syā, tsadapi voddiśyamānaviśeṣaṇatvānna vivacyeta /	But this is scarcely correct because in a case where we recognise the relationship of an object with the Primary, as mentioned by a Sentence, there alone could such an assertion be possible as a matter fact, however, no such thing is recognised in the case in question.
tasmātpūrvapace 'pi yāni ca pradhānasaṃvandhīni khugādīni yāni cārādupakārakasaṃmārgādisaṃbandhīni tāni sarvāṇi śamomayītvādiyuktānītyayukto nānāvṛścanuksaṃmārgaḥ /	For instance, in the case of the sentence yajnatharvaṇam vai kāmyā ishtayah, ta upañçu kartavyah, we find the qualification upançu con nected only with the Primary Sacrifices mentioned by the word kāmyāḥ and as such it cannot be taken as enjoined with reference to the subsi diary, as we shall explain later on but in the case in question, we have no such distinct relationship with the Primary and this makes all the difference. Objection It may be that the fact of the Sruk being of Came is for use in the Primary, though it is enjoined by implication, also in the subsidiary sacrifices not yet fully mentioned.
syādetat mukhyārtho vāṅgasyācoditatvāditi vaikṛtaviśeṣāṇāṃ kevalapradhānārthatvānnehāṅgapradhānārthatā bhaviṣyatīti / tadayuktam /	Reply This cannot be because we shall show in the chapter on Atidēça that the subsidiaries renouncing that which is enjoined in close proximity to themselves, become connected with their Primaries because they stand in need of such aids as have been fully accomplished along with the Primaries. That is to say, an Injunction of many things by a single sentence being unallowable, in the sentence in question, the Sruk must be taken as simply mentioned with reference to the fact of the Sruk being of Çami wood which alone is enjoined.
yajñātharvaṇaṃ vai kāmyā iṣṭayastā upāṃśu karttavyā iti hi pradhānaireva kāmya śabdopāttairupāṃśutvaṃ saṃbadhyamānamaṅgasyā coditamiti vacyate, na cātra tādṛśaḥ pradhānasaṃyoga iti vaiṣamyam / nanu cātideśikatvāda prāptāvastheṣvaṅgeṣu śamīmayotvādyupadigyamānaṃ pradhānamātrārthaṃ bhavet /	Consequently, even though the Sruk might be enjoined in connection with the subsidiaries, yet such an Injunction would stand in need of the fact of the employment of the Sruk of Cami at the Subsidiaries being got at by Implication from its employment at the Primaries. And the time that is taken in this latter implication of the Sruk of the Primary is exactly the same that is taken by the direct Injunction of the Sruk of the subsidiaries and as such there is no difference between the two processes. And further, if the fact of the Sruk being made of Çami wood applied to the Primaries alone, then even in the Varuṇapraghāsa sacrifice, which is a subsidiary, we would have the employment of the Sruk used at the Primary sacrifices of the Prayāja, &c. And the means by which we could avoid these Prayāja Sruks are the same by which the Sruks for cleaning are avoided.
nāītyevaṃ bhavitum /	But this is not quite desirable as there is no reason for such avoidance.
ya eva hi saṃmārgasucī varjjanopāyastenaiva prayājādisrugvarjanamapi prāpnoti, na caitadiṣṭaṃ yuktyabhāvāt / yadyapi ca kiṃ citpradhānamātra saṃbandha kāraṇaṃ bhavettathāpi saumikavedidakṣiṇānyāyena prasaṅgasiddhenaṃ prākṛtajātyupasaṃgraho yujyate /	Even though there may be some cause for the relation ship of a certain Primary, yet, in accordance with the Rule laid down in connection with the Saumikavēdidakshiņā, the element required would be got at indirectly by concomitance itself and as such no collecting of the Primary Class would be proper. Then again, the shape of the Paridhi vessel is pointed out by the use to which it is put and hence there could be no cleaning of that Paridhi which would not serve that purpose.
paridhirityagniparidhānārthaṃ dravyamucyate /	That is to say, Paridhi is the name of that substance which is used in the keeping intact of the fire just as Juhu is the name of an implement used in the Homa.
tathā homādyarthā juṅkādayastatra saṃmārgasyārthābhidhānakarmma cetyaprayojakatvamapi śakyaṃ vaktum/	Then, in accordance with the Sutra IVi, we could speak of the Cleaning being useless.
tataśca bāṇavatparidhiśravaṇe yadi tāvadaparicitādvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	And then, on having heard of the Paridhi being made of the Bāṇavat, if we were to clean the Palaça wood before it has been made into the Paridhi, we would only be cleaning that which is not Paridhi.
atha tānapi pariddhīta,tataḥ kṛte paridhāne prākṛtārthatā na syāt /	If the Palāça be FR made into the Paridhi before being cleaned, then the keeping of the Fire having been done, it could not serve any useful purpose in the Primary Sacrifice.
na ca tulyārthānāṃ samuccayo dṛṣṭaḥ /	Nor do we ever find a mixture of two things that serve the same purpose the Palaça and the Bäravat in the present case.
tasmānna paridhyantaramutpādanīyam /	Therefore there would be no need for making another Paridhi.
avabhṛthasya tvapūrvatvādyāvadaktamātra parthyavasāyinaḥ sāṅgasya cāpsu coditasya kena saṃmārge 'gnirvā prāpnoti yenotpādyeta /	As for the Avabhrtha, inasmuch as this is a new action, it ends wholly in what is directly mentioned in the Veda and as the whole of this action, together with all its accessories, is laid down as to be performed in water, what could be that Oleaning, in which we would have to make use of Fire, and hence have to burn it ? Thus then, none of the above three can be accepted as the uses of the present Adhikaraṇa.
tasyodāharaṇaṃ tvekaṃ satyam /	There is only one example which has been rightly cited.
tatra hi māṃsaṃ tu savanīyānāmiti sidvāntātpuroḍāśamātreṇā saṃvadhyamānaṃ tara samayatvamasavanīyatvānna parthyagnikaraṇapuroḍāśena saṃbadhyate /	In the case of the sentence ‘mānsantu savāniyānām in accordance with the Siddhānta, the character of being made up of tārasa meat, not being related to all Cakes, and thus being ‘asavanīya, it would not be connected with that Cake which has been purified by being carried round the fire.
na hi savanīyāṅge savanīyaśabdaprayogaḥ /	And the word Savaniya is never used with reference to the subsidiary of the Savanīya because it deals with that alone which is related to the Savaniya.
savanasaṃbandhivi ṣayatvāt / savanīyāṅgasya cāsavanārthatvāttatrāpi tu vrīhimayatvaṃ durlabham /	As for the subsidiary of the Savanīya, inasmuch as this serves no useful purpose in the Savana, it is impossible to have any cake in it made up of the Vrihi corn specially as the sentence Vrihibiryajēta distinctly shows that the Vrihi corn is to be employed in the Cake used at the Primary Sacrifice.
evaṃ tarhyaniyatadravyakatā paryagnikaraṇapuroḍāśasyeti pra yojanam /	And thus, it is not quite certain which is the material of which that Cake is to be made, which is purified by being taken round the Fire. And herein lies the use of the present Adhikarana.
tadapyayuktam /	But even this is not quite correct.
tathā sati kāṃsyabhojinyāyena tarasamayaparthyagnikaraṇenaiva śāstrārthopapatteḥ siddhāntārthasadṛśakarmaprasaṅgaḥ /	Because in that case in accordance with the maxim of the Kansabhoji the conditions of the scriptural Injunction that the Cake is circled round the fire would be fulfilled by the circling of the MeatCake and consequently there would always be a likelihood of the performance of an Action like what is described in the Siddhanta. Thus then, the corncake having been taken up, in some way or other, for the Primary Sacrifice, it must be held that the circling round fire is a means of accomplishing that Cake especially as such is the inclination of the scripture.
tatrāpi tvekacāyanīnyāyenāprayojakatvāt tadabhāve lopaprasaṅgaḥ /	But even in that case, such an action being useless, in accordance with the maxim of the oneyearold cow, there would be a total disappearance of that action.
tena etadeva prayojanamityāśrayaṇīyam /	And hence it is in the avoidance of this disappearance that lies the use of the present Adhikarana.
aniyata vyakatvaṃ vā / na cāṃtra kāṃsyabhojinyāyaḥ saṃbhavati /	Or, it might be in the fact of there being no definite material for the Cake nor does the maxim of the Kansabhoji apply to the case because the mere flesh does not represent the Cake. corns out of the flesh.
ataśca praiyaṅgavanyāyena pradhānamātre māṃsena puroḍāśo nivarttitaḥ /	Consequently, it must be admitted that in accord ance with the maxim of the Priyangu, it is only in the Primary Sacrifice that the Cake is to be made up of the flesh.
vā kathaṃ ciddhā prakṛtidarśanena brīhiyavadravyakaṃ iti sthitam /	As for the circling round fire, this applies to the Cake only and as for the material of this Cake, it may be uncertain, or it may be the Vrihi or the Yava, as is shown by the conditions of the Primary Sacrifice.
etāni ca prayojanāni khuksamārgasya prakṛtau bahasādhanatvāt kapiñcalanyāyena tritvasya śāstrīyatvāt pātrāvivṛdvāvapi paśucāturmāsyeṣu tisra eva saṃmāṭa̭ntyāḥ pūrvapakṣe /	As a matter of fact, however, the real uses of the Adhikaraṇa are the following In the Primary Sacrifice, there being many auxiliaries to the Cleaning of the Sruk, we conclude that the number of such auxi liaries must be three only, in accordance with the maxim of the Kapiñjala XIi and hence even when there is a multiplication of vessels, as in the case of the Paçucăturmãsya, only three Sruks would have to be cleaned, in accordance with the theory of the Purvapaksha.
siddhānte tu sarvāḥ, saṃskārasya pratipradhānāvarttitvāt /	In accord ance with the Siddhänta, on the other hand, all the Sruks have to be cleaned because of the necessity of repeating the purifiactory process with each substance.
tathā paśunyāyena vivakṣitaikasaṃkhyatvāt eka eva saṃmārṭavyaḥ paridhiḥ pūrvapakṣe /	And again, in accordance with the maxim of the ‘ Paçu’ IVi, significance attaching to the number one, only one Paridhi would have to be cleaned, according to the Purvapaksha while according to the Siddhanta, all the Paridhis would have to be cleaned and there would be some distinction made in a case where there is a multiplication of Paridhis.
siddhānte tu sarve /	believed according to the Purvapaksha to appertain to one Cake, comes according to the Siddhanta, to apply to all the Cakes.
yatra ca paridhivivṛddhistatra viśeṣaḥ /	The case of the Stuti and the Castra has been introduced, as an exception to the general definition laid down in Sūtra IIi.
evamekapuroḍāśe paryagnikaraṇaṃ sarvapuroḍāśe ca vaktavyam /	By the word Stuti is meant a hymn and the Castra also is a hymn which is made up of mantras that cannot be sung.
ki kāgnisaṃmārgakaraṇaṃ pūrvapakṣe / siddhānte tu tasyāprayojanatvenāsaṃskārthyatvātsarveṣāmā havanīyādīnāmiti viśeṣaḥ /	A Hymn is that which describes the relationship subsisting between an object and its properties and as such, in the first instance, it is accomplished by such objects and properties specially as in the absence of these the Hymn would be mere words, and as such not capable of being called a Hymn. Of these two again, inasmuch as the properties described do not form part of the Action to be performed, they serve no useful purpose with regard to the Action and as such they are taken absolutely as serving the purpose of completing the Hymn itself.
stutaśatrayostu saṃskāro yājyāva d devatābhidhānatvāt	Sutra But in that case, the mention of the name of the Deity would have to be carried away by its meaning because such mention is always subservient to the meaning.
yaistu dravyaṃ cikīrghyaṃtaityasyāpavādatvena stotraśastropanyāsaḥ /	That is to say, if the hymn in question consist of a Mantra, the object described in which does not exist at the time, then this object would carry away the Hymn from its present context, and as such, there would be a setting aside of that which is directly laid down.
stutireva stotraṃ śavamapi saivāpragotamantra sādhyā guṇaguṇisavandhakorttanaṃ ca stutiḥ śiṣyate/ sā ca prathamaṃ guṇaguṇibhyāṃ nirvarttyate /	For instance, in a case where we have an Injunction laying down the use of a particular hymn on a particular occasion, if the Injunction happen to contain the name of a Deity as in the case of a Hymn addressed to Indra being laid down as to be sung in connection with the Mahendragraha sacrifice, the Injunc tion would depend upon the Deity therein mentioned and hence in a case where that particular Deity Indra does not exist, as in the case of the Mahendra sacrifice,the particular Hymn will have to be carried away from the Mahendra sacrifice to another sacrifice where Indra might exist.
tadabhāve śabdoccāraṇamātrasya stutitvāvyapadeśāt /	And this would be a direct contradiction of what is authorised by the Order and Position of the Hymn, &c.
tannirvarttitā tu stutiḥ kiṃ stutyasya smārakatvena śeṣībhavatyata svaprādhānyenādṛṣṭārthā bhavatīti /	The particular sequential Order that would be contradicted in the present instance is that in which the mantra is laid down as to be recited in the subsequent hymns while the Position contradicted would beeither the mention of the Hymn by the Injunction of the Rathantara, or the particular Context in which they occur.
yadyatrāvidyamānārtho mantraḥ stotuṃ prayujyate /	Because a carrying away of the Mantra could be possible only if it mentioned something entirely different in the case in question however, the Hymn in question belongs to the same Deity that is referred to by the name Mahendra because the words Indra and Mahendra are ndifferent.
ya eva hi abhivatībhirindraḥ sṭṛyate sa eva māhendragraheṇejyate tatra satyevārthe kimityapakarṣaḥ syāt /	That is to say the Indra, that is hymned by the Hymns in question, is the same that is sacrificed to in the Mahendra sacrifice and as such the object referred to being actually present, wherefore should there be any necessity of carrying it away from non its Context? Nor is it absolutely necessary for the Mantra to make mention of every minute detail of the object connected with the sacrifice because it is always found to mention something more or less than that, in accordance with its own expression or capability and as such it does not matter if the Injunction of the Hymn speaks of Indra only, without the qualification Maha.
na ca yāvatkarmāṅgabhūterthe vidyate tatsarvaṃ mantreṇābhidhātavyaṃ, nyūnamadhikaṃ vā 'sau yadabhidhātuṃ samarthastadabhidhatte /	Nor does the Deity consist of the word aloneas we shall show under chapters IX and X. Thus then, it must be admitted that that which is mentioned by the word Indra is the same that is mentioned by the word Mahendra specially as there is no reason for assuming the two to be distinct. Consequently, there being no ground for the charge of the improper carrying away of the Hymns, these must be admitted to be the subser vient accessories of the Deity .
na śrutisamavāyitvāt	Sutra Reply Not so because it forms part of the scriptures.
naitadasti nirguṇendrābhidhānādanutkarṣa iti / prasajyata evotkarṣaḥ /	It has been urged above that the Hymns pointing to Indra, as apart from all qualifications, there is no need for any carrying away. But this is not so because the carrying away of the hymns is by no means avoidable.
yadyavayavavyutpattyā mahāṃśvāsāvindraśceti evaṃ mahendra śabdamancācaścāṇaistadvitānugamaḥ kriyeta, tata indra eva guṇamā viśi ṣṭo'sya grahasya devateti gamyeta /	For, if there were sufficient grounds for holding the identity of Indra and Mahendra, then alone would it not be necessary to carry away the Hymns as a matter of fact, however, there is a distinct difference between the two. To explainIn the case of the word Mahendra some people, seeking, to establish its identity with the word Indra, explain it etymologically thus Mahān + Indrah = Mahendrah the Great Indra, and then Ma hendro dēvatā asya Māhēndra That sacrifice of which the Great Indra is the presiding Deity. And in that case what the word Mahendra would signify would be that of which the preceding Deity is Indra as endowed with the attribute of greatness.
na tvevamasti samudāyaprasivibanlīyastvenendravyatiriktarūḍhiśabdābhidheyamahendrapratītaḥ /	But such a connotation is not possible because the signification of a word taken as one complete whole is always more authoritative than that which is sanctioned by its etymological con structions and hence the word Mahēndra more directly denotes a dis tinct Deity in the shape of Mahendra, than it does the Great Indra.
vyutpādyate mahendra śvedākyabhedādi duṣyati / avyutpattī mahendrārthaḥ sphuṭaṃ vastvantaraṃ bhavet	Then again, if the word Mahendra is broken up etymologically as shown above, there is a distinct syntactical split and if, in order to avoid this split, the etymological explanation is not resorted to, then the word Mahendra distinctly denotes something entirely different from Indra. Says the Bhashya, the nominal affix in Mahendra would not be possible if the word Indra stood in the need of a mention of greatness and what is meant by this is that it is not possible for us to take the word in its etymological sense.
'samarthaḥ padavidhiḥ' /	functioning of a compound, as also in that of the Nominal Affix, capability is always laid down as the necessary qualification.
'samarthānāṃ prathamāhe'ti ca samāsatadvitavṛtyorviśeṣaṇam /	That is to say, in the two sūtras samarthah padavidhih Pāṇini II ii and samarthänām prathamadva Ibid IVi, it is distinctly. laid down that samarthya or capability is the necessary qualification in the functioning of both the Compound and the Nominal Affix.
atastadabhāva naikayā 'pi bhavitavyam /	Con sequently, in the absence of this capability, no functioning of any of these is possible. I.
yadi yugapatmamāsatadvitāvanvākhyāyete tato naikatrāpi sāmarthya labhyate /	Be cause, if the chief stress were laid upon greatness as being needed by the word Indra, then this last word could not have any relationship with the Nominal Affix and, on the other hand, if the factor chiefly needed were the Affix itself, then there could be no connection with greatness.
ekārthobhāvalacaṇaṃ vyapebālakṣaṇaṃ vā sāmarthyamubhayathā'pi sāpekṣasya nāvakalpate /	This capability is explained by some to be in the shape of ekārthibhāvathe Identity of purpose, the fact of conjointly forming a single entity,and by others as vyapēkshā i.e., Relationship based upon mutual requirements. And neither of these two is applicable to that which stands in need of something else. J That is to say, when one factor is independent of everything else save the other factor in question, then alone can there be any identity of purpose between these two.
anya vastvanapecanve hyanye nai kārthateṣyate /	In a case, however, where one factor is distracted by other agencies, no such identity of purpose is possible..
sāpekṣastvanyavicipto naikāthya~ pratipadyate	When, however, there happens to be a dependence upon others, there is always a doubt in the matter, and the whole does not point to any one definite end.
vyapekṣā punarāhatya vigatāpekṣatocyate /	That is to say, that which depends upon others can never be spoken of as Vyapeksha free from dependence.

krameṇākhyāyamāneṣu vākyabhedo 'maka chuteḥ / kṛtvā samāsamuccāya~ punaḥ śabdadvayaṃ bhavet	If, however, the functionings of the Compound and the Affix be explained separately, one after the other, then, inasmuch as the words will have to be often times repeated, there would be a split of the sentence because in that case, after we have expounded the Compound, it will be necessary for us to give utterance again to the two words Mahat and Indra.
mahendra iti hi syānna cendra viśeṣaṇaṃ mahattvam /	That is to say, in that case we would have the form Mahaindra,” the qualification great having nothing to do with Indra, because that which occupies a secondary position, and as such has its own denotation suppressed, cannot be connected with any other qualifications.
na hyupasarjanamabhibhūta svārthavṛtti viśeṣaṇāntaraiḥ saṃyujyate, na ca samāsārthe vṛttasyeti vākyabheda mātreṇaivocyate/	The declaration of the Bhashyawhen taken up by the functioning of the Compound, &c., &c.refers to the split of the sentence mentioned above.
tena kramavṛttirapi nāstoti pratipādya punargyugapadvṛttimeva doṣāntarābhidhitmayopanya tantravārtike/	Thus then, having explained the improbability of any gradual func tioning, the Bhashya again brings forward the theory of simultaneous functioning, but only with a view to point out other discrepancies in the theory.
aikaśabdye parārthavadityanena nyāyenendraśabdasya mahattvataddhitā /	In accordance with the maxim propounded in the Sūtra Iiv, there would be another syntactical split consequent upon the fact of the word Indra being the predominant factor with reference to greatness, while it occupies a subordinate position with reference to the Nominal Affix.
prati vairupyanimittavākyabhedaprasaṅgaḥ /	For instance, what the Injunctive affix will have to do would be to point out that Indra is qualified by greatness and that Indra is related to the material offered at the sacrifice and this would lead to an inevitable syntactical split.
vidhyanekavyāpārātmakaśvāparo vākyabhedaḥ /	What is possible is that the word be taken as one independent whole, independently of the component parts as in that case alone could the Nominal Affix be rightly explained.
tathā hi	And thus it is established that Mahendra is a deity other than Indra.
vyapadeśācca	Nor can it be urged that Indra himself came to be called Mahendra, the Great Indra, after he had performed the grand feat of killing Vrttra, because in that case the Veda, in which the word Mahendra occurs, would have a beginning in time.
vyapadeśabhedācca bhedaḥ /	Sutra . Also because of names. That is to say, Indra must be distinct from Mahendra, because of the difference in their names.
evaṃ ca mantrayorvyavasthā bhaviṣyati /	Thus alone could there be any restriction with regard to the Mantras in question as otherwise there would be an option and as such in one case, the mantra would be set aside from its legitimate purpose.
asati cārthabhede mantrabheda syādṛṣṭārthatā prasajyeta	And if there were no difference between Indra and Mahendra, the only purpose that the mention of two distinct Mantras could serve would be to bring about a transcendental result, which is not allowable in the case.
evaṃ vyākhyāyamāne tu ruḍhive tadvite sati /	Therefore, just as the Sun, &c., are different from Indra, so also is Mahendra and as such it would be absolutely necessary to carry away the Hymn elsewhere as shewn above. Thus ends the exposition of the Adhikarana in accordance with the Bhashya.
agnīṣomādayaḥ sarve rūḍhitvānna didevatāḥ mahadindra śabdayostāvadavaśyaṃ pṛthagarthābhidhānaśaktiḥ kalpayitavyā /	That is to say, the Aindragna cake cannot be treated in the way that is prescribed for the Agneya cake for if the word Agneya were to refer to the Aindrăgna also, then, inasmuch as the word Agni would be dependent upon Indra, there could be no nominal Affix in the word Agnèya. If these words were conventional wholes, what would be dependent upon what ? So too we shall show later on that the Aindrapaushna is held to be subsidiary to the Agnishomiya, &c., on the sole ground of both of them having two presiding Deities and this would not be possible if the words did not signify the presence of two Deities.
tayośca guṇaguṇyabhidhāyitvādviśeṣaṇaviśeṣyātmakatvamavadhāritam/ tatra yāvadeva saṃhatābuccāritau tāvadeva pūrvānubhūtārthasaṃbandhitayā viśiśarthapratyayo jāyate /	If no authority be attached to grammatical rules, then the rule laying down the addition of affixes, denotative of Agni, &c., being the deity, would also be unauthoritative, and as such Agni, Soma, &c., would cease to be known as deities. If, however, this latter fact is admitted, then on exactly the same grounds, it would be necessary to admit the duality of the deities also.
na cāsya nivarttakaṃ kiṃ cidasti /	And as such the word cannot be taken as a complete whole in itself in dependently of its component parts.
na ca samudāyasyā pūrva śaktyantarakalpanāpramāṇaṃ vidya santravārtike /	Because a grammatical rule can be said to be for the mere sake of certain modifications of accentuation, &c., and to have no other significance, only in a case where the senses conveyed by the word be, in some way or other, not in keeping with a wellrecognised fact of ordinary perception.
labdhātmikā ca samudāyaprasiddhiravayavaprasiddhiṃ bādhate / na cāvayavārtharahitārthāntaraprayogaṃ vispaṣṭamantareṇa tadātmanābhaḥ /	In the case of the words Mahat and Indra, it is certainly necessary to assume a distinct significance for each because we do not find any disagreement from a perceived fact and inasmuch as these words signify, one the qualification and the other the qualified, we come to the conclusion that one word qualifies the other. And as soon as these words are pronounced together, we are at once led, by our previouslyacquired notion of their relationship, to the joint cognition of the one as qualified by the other and there is nothing to set aside this joint cognition. Nor is there any reasonable ground for assuming, for the compound, any signi ficauce, apart from those of the component words.
pratyakṣepi tāvadarthe 'nekaśabdaśaktaḥ kalpanā niṣpramāṇikā, kimuta yatrārtha sadbhāvo 'pi kalpanīyaḥ /	Then again, it is only when the whole word by itself has been duly established as complete in itself, independently of the component words, that the denotation of this word, as such a whole, would set aside that which is provided by the component words in case of course the two happen to be mutually contradictory. But no such word could be taken to be a duly established entity by itself, until we actually found it used as such, apart from having anything to do with the signification of its component parts.
tadihendra śabdaprayogānyathānupapatyendrastāvadadṛṣṭo 'pi kalpyate, tatra yadi punamahendraśabdaprayogānyathā'nupapattirbhavettatorthāntaraṃ mahendro nāma ka lapyeta /	And further, we find a great difficulty in believing in the existence of Indra and it would entail a much greater difficulty to assume the existence of another and an altogether distinct deity in the shape of Mahendra. We accept the existence of an object in the shape of Indra, simply on the ground that, otherwise, the use in the Veda of the word Indra would not be explicable. And thus if the use of the word Mahendra too were equally inexplicable, then alone we could have any ground for assuming the existence of an object in the shape of Mahendra. As a matter of fact however, the use of the word Mahendra is quite explicable, as based upon the wellrecognised denotations of the two words Mahat and Indra and hence the word is found to convey an idea of the same Indra as qualified by greatness and as such there is no ground for assuming the existence of any other object.
tasmādindra eva mahattvaviśiṣṭo mahendro nānya iti siddham/	And hence it is proved that Mahēndra is none other than Indra qualified by greatness.
naca samāsaṃ kṛtvā tadvite kriyamāai kasya cidasāmarthyaṃ samāsavelāyāṃ tadvitavelāyāṃ cāpekṣaṇīyārthāntarānupādānāt /	Further, when we expound the fuctioning of the Compound first and then explain that of the Affix, there is no incapability pertaining to anything because at the actual time of the functioning of the compound, or that of the Affix,there is nothing else that the factor stands in need of.
na ca dviruccāraṇanimittavākyabhedaprasaktiḥ sakaduccāritaikapadopāttānekārthakathanāt /	Nor is there any syntactical split due to repeated utterance because all that we do, by the repeated utterance, in expounding the compound, is to give expression to the many meanings that are expressed by the word pronounced but once.
ekaikā ca vṛttirvākyārthe varttate / tatra ya yorvākyayorathā māhendrapanopātau tau tābhyāṃ nirbhidya kathyete /	The word Mahendra has a double functioning in the shape of the Compound and in that of the Affix each of these func tionings represents a distinct sentence and it is the meanings of these two sentences that we give distinct expression to by the expounding of the Compound and the explanation of the bearing of the Affix.
yaccātrāsakṛduccāraṇaṃ dṛśyate na tadvedavacanasyaiva / na hi kadā cidapyevaṃrūpo vedo 'sti mahāṃcāsāvindraśca mahendro devatā asyeti māhendraḥ / na caitadeva vaidikaṃ padamevaṃ vibhajyate vibhāgasya pauruṣeyatvenāvaidikatvāpatteḥ /	And as for the repetition that we have recourse to, in the reexpounding, it is not that of any Vedic sentence because there is no such Vedic sentence as Mahānç cāsāvindraçca, Mahendro dēvatā asya it Mahēndrah. Nor is it the Vedic word itself that is so disjoined because all disjunction being brought about by human agency, the word ceases to be Vedic altogether. The fact is that in the Veda, the word Mahendrah occurs in its own complete form and it is only the meaning of this word that is explained by means of the afore said disjoinings and etymological explanations &c., proceeding from human sources.
vicitraśaktīni hi padāni ekānekapadārthapratīteḥ /	As a matter of fact, words are endowed with various potencies, bring ing about as they do, the cognitions of one or many meanings.
tathaiṣāmarthakathanaṃ kadā citpadenaivānyena kriyate kadācidvākyena, tenāpyekenāne kena vā dvipadena bahupadena veti vaicityam /	And the meaning of a word is explained, sometimes by means of another word, and sometimes by means of a sentence, and that too being one or many, consisting of two or more words.
tadyathā kaḥ pikaḥ kokinaḥ ka aupagavaḥ upagorapatyam /	For instance, the meaning of the word Pika is explained by Kokila Aupagava is explained as the son of Upagu, or as one who was produced by Upagu from out of his wife.
na caivaṃ kathayatāṃ vākyabhedaḥ prasajyate /	there is no syntactical split. Nor is the explanation found to refer to any portion that is not denoted by the word explained.
evameva yadi māhendrapadopātto 'rthastadaspṛśabhireva śabdaśaktividbhiḥ puruṣaiḥ skhavākyenaikenānekena vā ka thyate kastatra vākyabhedaḥ, śatakṛtvo 'pi hi svavākyamuccāryamāṇaṃ na vedaṃ dūṣayati /	In the same manner, when the meaning of the word Mahendra happens to be ex plained by persons cognisant of the various signications of words, who employ one or more words of their own, without touching the Vedic text itself where is there a symtactical split ? For our own sentence, even if uttered a hundred times, would not vitiate the Vedic sentence. And when the meaning of the Veda is explained, the word itself does not become human.
kathyamānaḥ krameṇa kathayatavyaḥ, so 'pi ca prakṛtipratyaya paurvāparyeṇetyevaṃ kathyate /	And when a certain fact is being spoken of by a man, it is ne cessary that it should be spoken of in a certain order of sequence, and that too in accordance with the due sequence of the roots and affixes f.i.
māṃsvāsāvindraścetyādi /	Mahānçcāsavindrah, &c.
na caivaṃ sāpeścatvam /	and certainly, in this there is no dependence upon other factors.
atha vā bhavati vai pradhānasya sāpeścasyāpi samāsa iti yadyapīndra śabdastadvitāpeśastathā'pi mahattvaṃ prati prādhānyāllabhate samāsam / ataśca yugapadapecāyāmavirodhastathā 'pi tu vṛttiḥ krameṇaiva /	G Then again, even in the case of one factor depending upon another factor, there is every ground for there being a Compound, provided the former be the predominant factor consequently if the word Indra were dependent upon the Nominal Affix, it could be very well compounded, be cause of the fact of its being the predominant factor, with regard to greatness. Thus then, even though, in case of the simultaneous functionings of the Compound and the Affix, there is nothing incongruous in the fact of the factors being dependent upon other factors, yet the functioning in question is gradual. Because the word Indra, though dependent upon the Affix, is yet compounded on account of its predominant character and when dependent upon greatness it becomes subordinate, and hence the functioning of the Affix has to come in later on.
tena yatraiva pradhānaṃ sāpekṣaṃ tatraitayaiva tāvad vṛttyā bhavitavyamiti samāsa eva prathamaṃ bhavati /	That is to say, in a case where the predominant factor is dependent upon something else, the func tioning must be one of this kind and hence it is the compounding that comes in first.
yadi vā kṛtvā samāsaṃ tantreṇa vṛtiriṣyeta, tataḥ śad indrastadvitasaṃbandhī śuddhaśva samāsabhāgiti nirguṇasyaivendrasya devatātvāpatterguṇānarthakyaprasaṅgaḥ /	If, however, after the compounding has been done, the functioning be held to come in its wake, of its own accord, then the result would be that Indra by itself would be connected with the Affix and on the other hand, the same pure Indra would come to compounded and as such we would have, for the deity in question, Indra alone, without any qualifications and as such the mention of the qualification great would become absolutely useless.
na cendramahattvayoryugapattadvitārthe nipatitayoraruṇaika cāyanyādivatparasparasampravārtike /	Nor is it possible to assert that, as in the case of the red oneyearold cow, so in that of Indra and Mahat also, the two coalesce in the denotation of the Affix, and as such serve to limit one another.
na hyakriyāyāṃ yugapatmannipāto nāpi viśeṣavaśīkārasāmarthyam /	Because where there is no Action in question, there can be no such simultaneous coalescence. Nor is it possible for that which is not an Action to draw within itself any qualifications.
satyapi ca dvandvadevatāpattiḥ /	Mahendra would be possible only in case Mahendra wer one deity, and not if the word Mahendra contained the names of two distinct deities.
akṛtasamāsayośca mahadindra śabdayorane katvādvivakṣitaikasaṃkhya prātipadikanimittataddhita saṃbandhābhāvaprasaṅgaḥ /	And again, if the words Mahat and Indra were two distinct Nouns, with independent declensional affixes, then there could be no such noun as Mahendra, and hence no chance for the affix in question and if there are no such Nouns ending in declensional affixes, then they could not form a compound.
tasmānna yugapadvṛttiḥ, iti kramavṛttyā samāsārthasyaiva devatātvam/	For these reasons, simultaneous functioning is not possible and hence through the aforesaid gradual functioning, we conclude that the object signified by the Compound itself is the deity.
ataścendra eva guṇasaṃyukto mahendro nārthāntaramiti pūrvapaca eva śobhana ityanyaduttaraṃ vācyam	And consequently Mahendra. is none other than Indra qualified by greatness. Thus then, we find that for reasons above explained, the Purvapaksha position appears to be quite reasonable and hence we must have recourse to another line of argument with a view to its effectual refutation.
yadyapyabhinno'rthastathāpi vidhiśabdasya mantratve bhāvaḥ syāditi mahendra śabdenaivoccamānasyāsmin grahayāge devatātvaṃ nānyathā /	As a matter of fact, the Deity enters into the sacrifice, not in its material form, but in the verbal i.e., in the form in which it happens to be mentioned in the scriptural Injunction consequently, inasmuch as it is by the word Mahendra that the Deity is mentioned, we cannot but accept Mahendra as the Deity. Even if the meanings of the two words Indra and Mahendra be identical,the deity in the particular sacri fice in question must be that which is spoken of by the word Mahendra in accordance with the law laid down under Sutra Vidhiçabdasya mantra tvē, &c., Xiv and none other.
tatra sakalaparyyāyeṇāpi buidindrādiśabdeno camānasya devatātvaṃ na bhavati kimuta nyūnenaivendraśabdena /	And hence the character of the deity could not belong even to those mentioned by such names as Vrha dindra, &c., words that are more akin to Mahendra than Indra, to say nothing of such other words as Indra and the like. C When we find a certain Deity in a certain form laid down in con nection with a certain sacrifice,even though the Deity be the object denoted, and not the merely Verbal form, yet, if we find the slightest difference from it in another otherwise expressed, we cannot admit this to be the Deity of that sacrifice.
tathā hi	find that the Deity invoked has been exactly the same as is therein laid down.
kutaḥ	This will be explained later on, where it is shown that Agni is the Deity of the Ashtakapāla, and not of the Ajya because with regard to the latter Agni is not laid down as the Deity.
ācāryo mātuśceti dravyaikatve 'pi dṛśyate / apekṣā hetubhedena vyavahāraḥ pṛthaktayā	R Another reason for this is that, inasmuch as in the Injunction in ques tion, the Deity is predicated of something else, due significance must be attached to its qualifications and adjuncts specially as no such significance could be attached to them, only in case the Deity were that with regard to which something else was predicated.
guṇaścānarthakaḥ syāt	If however, the qualifications were such as having something else predicated of themf..,.
yadi cādimānanādirvā guṇaḥ kevala mindrastutyarthamevopāḍhīyate na devatātve'ntarbhavati, tato''syopādānamevānarthakaṃ syāt /	Hence, in the case in question, even if the Deity were to enter into the sacrifice, in its material form, we could not accept it as without its qualification as a matter of fact, however, we find that it helps the sacrifice, in its verbal form, and consequently anything else, that would be mentioned by a word apart from the Injunc tion, could not be recognised as the prescribed Deity. And further, when the Deity is mentioned by means of a compound, it would not be open to the fault of the Injunction referring to more than one thing.
sarvā ddi devataivamarthamabhidhīyate vidhīyate vā, kathaṃ nāma taduddetantravārtika /	That which is mentioned by this latter word can never be the Deity of that sacrifice and as such in the case of an injunction of this sacrifice, any mention of that Deity would be absolutely useless. Thus then we find that the sense of Sutra comes to be that the cognition of the Deity depends upon actual verbal expression and the fact of a certain word expressing the Deity comes to be accepted only if it is found that such expression is in keeping with the character of the Nominal Affix.
śena karmma kriyeteti /	Says the Bhashya When depending on contact with the nominal affic, &c., &c.
yadi ca avihite vihite ca guṇe kevalenendreṇa vyavahriyate tato nārtho guṇābhidhānena /	And the sense of this is that, though the compounding is quite possible when the principal factor is dependent upon something else, there is room for the nominal affix when it is in the pure condition of the Noun but at the time that the affix appears, there being no declensional ending, no compounding would be possible.
na hi grahasaṃbandha indrasya prāpto, yena tadgatendrānuvādena maha tvaṃ kevalameva stutyarthamucyeta / na ca mahānindraḥ prāpto yato guṇenopajacya vidhoyeta/	On the other hand, if the affix were attached to the word Indra only, then the qualification greatness would fail to enter into it. As for the gradual functioning one after the other of the Compound and the Affix, you do not admit of it. If the affix were attached in the first instancei.e., before the coming in of the word Mahatthen, we would be open to the two objections urged above Text, p. viz the greatness would apply to the material of the sacrifice, and not to the Deity, which would become the subordinate factor and the final shape of the word would be Mahaindra and not Mahendra ! The mere word Indra, when functioning along with the Compound, could not be related to the nominal Affix.
tasmādaprāpta vidherchevatāntaratā /	Consequently it must be admitted that the Hymns in question will have to be carried away to that place where there is a complete harmony be.
tathā yājyāpurorucoḥ	Sutra So also with regard to the Yajya and the Purōruc.
pūrvavanmantravyapadeśabheda vyavasthā	The difference of names in these also is to be explained in the same way as that in the foregoing Mantra.
yatreti vā 'rthavattvāt syāt	Sutra In the case of the barren goat, we perceive the object as actually existing.
balavatpramāṇavirodhe saṃskārapakṣastyajyeta, na ca so'sti, ciṅgabalīyastvā dutkarṣasiddherityaparyudāsaḥ saṃskārapakṣasya	The Purvapaksha could be rightly renounced only if it were found to be opposed to a strong authority. As a matter of fact, however, it is not so because the authority of Linga Indicative Power of the words of a Hymn. is certainly much stronger than that of Order or Context, &c.
anutkṛṣyamāṇa eva vā pragāthaḥ sannidhivaśādavayavadvāreṇa ma hendramavirodhāya harārthatvāya ca prakāśayiṣyati, yathā 'gnīṣomoye manotāyāmagniśabdaḥ prakaraṇātmamāmasthaḥ pratīyamānaḥ sādvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	and hence we cannot very well give up the Purvapaksha theory. II. The word Indra being a part of the word Mahendra could be taken as signifying the sense of the latter compound as by so doing we reconcile the otherwise contradictory bearings of the Linga and the Krama just as we have in the case of the word Agni as occurring in the Manotā Vide Xiv. That is to say, it would not be neces sary to remove the Hymn, as on account of close proximity, we could accept the part Indra to indicate the whole Mahendra specially as in so doing we avoid the contradiction between Linga and Krama, and also the necessity of having to assume a transcendental result for the Hymn. For instance, in the case of the Agnishomiya, though we find the word Agni alone in the Manota Mantra, yet finding, from con text, that it forms part of a compound Agnishoma, we accept it as indicating Soma also, and as such affording the sense of the whole compound.
ataścānutkarṣe 'pyadoṣa iti	Consequently there is nothing incompatible, even if we do not remove the Hymn from its place.
na hi yamādonāṃ grahāntareṣvapi devatātvaṃ yenendravadutkṛṣṭairmantraiḥ prakāṇyeran /	Sutra Reply This could not be the case with those Mantras that are directly laid down. As a matter of fact we find that in many places we do not find the same meaning in all the Mantras that are laid down in that connec tion, when these latter are removed from that context. For instance, in the case of the sentence yamyāh çańsanti and the like, inasmuch as Yama is not the Deity of the other Grahas, if the Mantras laid down in that context were to be removed from there, they could not point to him.
atasteṣāṃ tāvadvidhyānarthakyaprasaṅgādavaṇyamadṛṣṭārthatvena bhaktivyam /	And as in that case the very injunction of these would be useless, it would be necessary to admit the fact of their leading to transcenden tal results. And this may be said of all similar cases as the one in question.
tataśca tatmāmānyāditareṣu tathātvaṃ, tamānna saṃskāra karmmatvamiti	This Sutra proceeds to show that the removing of the Mantra would not make any Injunction useless. Though Yama, &c., are not the Deities of the grahas, yet they could be indicated by the Mantras, as being of use in other actions.
maṇḍūkasūktasyāgnau prayogaḥ, tatra maṇḍūkenāgnivikarṣaṇāmnānāt / akṣavaktasya rājasvaye, tatrācaivyatīti vidhānāt/	instance the Manduka Hymn is used in the Agni, as it is therein laid down that the Fire is be drawn in with the Manduka sūkta the Akshasukta is employed in the Rajasuya, as therein it is laid down that the gambling is done with the dice aksha the Mushikāsūkta is employed in the Ekadaçini, as in this the sentence akhustē, &c., having described the connection of a certain place, this makes the Hymn one eulogising that place.
kuṣumbhakasūktādīnāṃ tu yadi kvacidviśeṣarūpeṇārtho nāsti tataḥ sāmānya vidhānenārthavattā bhaviṣyati / vācaḥ stome sarvamantropadeśāt /	As for the Kushumbhaka and other hymns, if we do not find any particular use of these, we can accept them as having their use in those cases where the general term Mantra is used in the Injunction and no particular Mantra is specified as for instance, we find that all Mantras are laid down as to be employed in the Vacastoma.
tathā ''śvine sūryodayāvadhi samāptyasaṃbhave sarvāsāmṛcāmupadeśāt /	So too in the case of the Açvina sacrifice, it is laid down that in case the sun should rise before the sacrifice is finished, all Rk verses should be recited as an expiatory rite.
tatra vacanenaivāsamavetārthamantravidhānasāmarthyāda gatera dṛṣṭārthāśrayaṇaṃ, na cakka cidadṛṣṭārthatvena sarvacaiva dṛśyamānamapyarthaṃ procādṛṣṭārthatvakalpanā yujyate /	In cases like these, however, inasmuch as we find that the Mantras laid down do not mention any object that appears in the sacrifice in its material form, we have to accept the fact of their leading to transcendental results. But because a transcendental result is admitted in one case, that is no reason, why we should rejeçt a visible purpose, even when it is pre sent, and always assume a transcendental one. For instance, because the reciting of the Vaishnavi verse is found to serve only a transcen dental purpose it does not follow that only transcendental results fol low also from that of the Yajya and the like, which are found to serve distinctly visible purposes.
api vā śrutisaṃyogātmakaraṇe stautiśaṃsatī kiyotpatti vidadhyātām	Sutra Reply Because of the fact of the direct men tion of the Genitive, &c., the words stauti and çansati ap pearing in the context, would have to be taken as having their use in bringing about distinct transcendental results Apūrvas.
yaduktaṃ manotāyāmivāgniśabda indraśabdassamāsārthaṃ lakṣayighyatīti/ tadayuktam/ kutaḥ /	It has been urged that like the word Agni in the Manota, the word Indra would indicate the sense of the compound, Mahendra. But this is not correct, because there being nothing incompatible in the directly ex pressed meaning of the word Indra, there is no reason why it should give up its direct denotation, and take to indirect Indication? And then again, as it would always be possible, by some sort of an indirect indi cation, to find a visible result for all that is held to be leading to trans cendental results,this process of interpretation is by no means allow able.
etasmādeva doṣāt /	Then it has been urged that there would be nothing wrong, even if the Hymn were removed from its place.
na candra śabdasya svārthamabhidadhataḥ kaścidvirodho yena śrutirvṛttiṃ jahyāt /	But it is not so because Direct Assertion, as defined by Proximity, distinctly points to the fact of the Hymn in question forming a part and parcel of the collection of Hymns with which it is mentioned. And as for the functioning of Linga, it can have no injunctive potency, until the recognition of a general rela tionship between the Mantra and the Deity.
sarvā dṛṣṭārthānāṃ ca yathā kathaṃ cimacāyā dṛṣṭārthatvāpādanasaṃbhavādayuktametat / yattūktam utkṛṣyatāmeveti tadayuktam	That is to say, if the case were such that it was absolutely definitely ascertained that the Hymn serves a visible purpose,in that case alone could the Direct Assertion, defined by Proximity, be set aside. When, however, the case is such that it is only after the Hymn has been employed that its use is sought after, and the commencement of the action does not depend upon the use.then the Hymn having been employed. in accordance with the authority of Order and Proximity, it does not matter whether we assume a visible or an invisible result.
prakṛtastotraśeṣatvaṃ śrutyā sannidhiklṛptayā /	As for the Hymn, when removed from its place, we do not find any reason for employing it in any other place.
vinā sāmānya saṃbandhālliṅgaṃ cāviniyojakam	Linga can have nothing to do with regard to the expression of any relationship between the Deity and the Action.
prativṛttā bhaviṣyanti tvatpaśce 'nyārthavṛttayaḥ	In the case in ques tion, however, we do not find any ground for such general relationship. Consequently if the Hymns are removed from these places, they cannot but become useless and hence it is only right to accept the fact of their bringing about transcendental results.
prakāśanaṃ punaḥ paramārthatastāvadātmāghāram /	That is to say, the action of denoting the qualification and the qualified resting in the letters of a word, thus alone could the presence of the Locative be explained.
karmmatvapratipa tyuttarakālaṃ ca vyāpyatvāddevatādhāram / tatra kavatīnāmaikāntikameva karaṇatvamiti vaiṣamyam /	or manifestation of the Deity, all such manifestation in the first instance must reside in have for its substrate the Self of the person and sub sequent to the comprehension of the character of the Action, the mani festation of the Deity as the Result resides in the Deity while as for the Kavati, it must always remain the Instrument or means of that mani festation and this makes a great difference between the two theories.
api ca stauti śaṃsatīti stutibhāvanā pūrvāparībhūtā śrūyate /	Then again, the injunction or Bhavana of eulogyin the words Stauti, Çunsatiis cognised as extending over a definite period of time and in this Injunction, the denotation of the Root serves as the means while all the other nouns, with the several endings, come to be related, only inasmuch as they help in the fulfilment of the Root.
ta yadi mantrāḥ stotranivṛttyarthā bhavanti tato'peścitārthaṃkaraṇācchādṛṣṭamarthaṃ kurvanto dṛṣṭarthā bhavanti /	Thus then, when the mantras serve the purpose of accomplishing the Hymns, then, inasmuch as they accomplish something that is desired, they serve a purpose laid down in the Scriptures, and as such come to have a dis tinctly useful end. When they do the manifestation of the Deity, on the other hand, they do something that is not laid down in the Scriptures and as such are found not to serve any apparent purpose.
tataśca varaṃ stṛtīnāmeva dṛṣṭārthatvam /	Hence it is more reasonable by far to have the Hymns serving distinctly useful purposes.
śabdapṛthatkkāca pṛthakkaniveśinī dvidvādaśasaṃkhyā na prakāśanābhede sati śabdenocyate / sāmānyāvivakṣāyāṃ vā pratyakṣaṃ pratipadaṃ ca tannirvṛttena dādaśatve 'vatiṣṭhate /	If in the case in question, predominance belonged to the Deity, then being expressible by a noun only, the word mentioning it would be found with the nominative ending, which could not express any thing else, as we find in the sentence agnirmūrdha, &c., &c. In the case in question, however, even that which we find having the nominative ending is actually found,on account of the fact of the homogeneity of the sentence as preceded by the capability of the words used, to be for the purpose of expressing the connection of the qualification as for in stance, Indro yato jangamasyāvasitasya rājā! And as there is no use of the qualifications, these cannot be accepted as the predominant factor and hence the only reasonable course open to us is to accept the word expressive of the Deity to be subservient to the Hymn which latter cannot be taken as subserviently pointing out the Deity.
nanu ca stutāvapi tulyametat /	There should be a stop in the Bhashya after the word Satyam as otherwise the word could not be construed in anyway.
atha stomavaśāhaksamudāyamādhyāḥ stutayo gaṇyante tathā prakāśanānyapītyaviśeṣaḥ	And thus the words Stauti and Çansati cannot in any way be taken as serving the purpose of the indirect indication of the Deity and as such predominance must be attached to the Eulogistic Hymn only. Sutra Because of the distinctness implied by the word. We find it declared in the Veda that the Agnishtoma is accom panied by twelve Hymns and here the mention of the number twelve shows that each hymn is distinct by itself.
kiyāḥ phalāpavargiṇyastatsaṃkhyā gaṇanāssadā /	There is no ground for assuming the appearance of such a transcendental result, either from each verse, or from all the Hymns taken together.
apūrvādaśatvācca dvādaśatvaṃ nirūpyate	Whereas in the case of manifestation of Deity, we actually perceive the word and the Deity.
anarthakaṃ ca tadvacanam	Sutra The mention would be absolutely useless.
ṛcāmanūhyatvādāgneyagraha codanayaivāgneyīnāṃ stutisādhanatvasiddheḥ āgneyoṣu stuvataityanarthakaṃ vacanam	In the case of such sentences agnēya grahā bhavanti and then again, agneyishu stuvanti inasmuch of Vedic verses are incapable of being assumed or tampered with, the former sentence being enough for the pur poses of pointing out the fact of the Agnēyimantras being the means of hymning Agni, there would be absolutely no use for the second sen tence. That is to say, if the word Agneyi only served the purpose of pointing out the fact of Agni being the Deity, then the employing of these Hymns would be enjoined by the first sentence itself and hence there would be no use for the second sentence.
yadidaṃ dvitīyāpratipādita karmmā īmabhidhānamidaṃ cāparaṃ prādhānye kāraṇam/	As a matter of fact, how ever, the second sentence should be taken as serving the purpose of pointing out the Hymn as an independent Action. Sutra Because we distinctly find the meanings of the two to be different.
pradhānakriyā hi kena cipeṇetā agnihotraṃ juhotyāghāramāghārayatītivadbhavati, na saṃskāra kriyā 'tyantaguṇabhūtatvāt /	All relationship being based upon a certain difference between the objects related,inasmuch as we find the two sorts of Hymns Stotra and the Castra mentioned as related to each other, these two must be taken as distinct from each other, which could not be, if both equally served the purpose of pointing out the Deity.
atha vā stotra śastrasamākhyayoramidhānatvaṃ tatprādhānyajñāpanārtham /	Objection Both the Stotra and the Castra being equally stuti the above argument would apply to the case of that also. As for the fact of the two being two different individuals, those grounds of difference.
itarathā hi prakāśanamityevaṃ samākhyā syāt /	The reply to this would be in the shape of the arguments brought forward above in connection with the mention of the number twelve.
devataiva pradhānatvātphalaṃ yācyeta karmmavat / na svāmini sthite kaściddāsātprārthayate phalam	That is to say, the transcendental results following from the Stotra and the Castra being totally distinct, it is on the ground of this difference in the results that the Actions themselves are held to be different and on this difference would be based the mention of their relationship. While as for the manifestation of the Deity, there is no such difference either in the action of manifestation or in its results.
na karmmāntaratāstyatra banavatpratyabhijñayā / na copātto guṇaḥ kaścinna ca vākyāntare stutiḥ	This could not be the case with the subsidiary Actions, which are wholly subordinated to others, and as such not desired in themselves. II. The Sutra may be explained in another way The very men tion of the two names Stotra and Castra is meant to point to the fact of these being principal Actions otherwise the word used should have been prakāçana manifestation only or there would be no name at all, as in the case of the words avahanti and the like.
dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Secondly, when the injunction in the case occurs in another Brāhmaṇa passage, which has all its needs Arthavada to that Injunction.
na hyatra viśeṣa heturasti kiṃ brāhmaṇavihitamāsādyopacatavidhiśaktimantraḥ smārako bhavatyatha vā viparyaya iti / tatrobhayoranuvādatvāsaṃbhavādgṛhyamāṇaviśeṣatvāca iyorapi vidhāyakatvam /	For these reasons, Mantras should be taken only as recalling what has already been enjoined elsewhere. Against the above explanation of the Adhikarana we bring forward the following objections What reason is there by which the injunctive potency of the verb is suppressed simply by the fact of its occurring in the Mantra, and is enlivened by appearing in the Brāhmaṇa ? We actually find verbs in Mantras serving the purposes of injunction, e.g., Vasantaya Kapinjalāna labhatë and conversely there are, sometimes, verbs occurring in the Brah mana, not having the injunctive potency e.g., Yasyobhayam havirārti marchet, &c.
abhyāsācca karmabheda syāt / bannavatpratyabhijñāyāsvābhyāsādhikaraṇaṇvottaraṃ bhaviṣyati /	Further, if the Mantra be taken as supplementary to the Brah mana, simply on the ground of the action having been enjoined in the latter, why could not we take the Brāhmaṇa injunction itself as simply recalling the action previously enjoined by the Mantra? That is to say, there is no special reason whereby it could be ascertained whether the Mantra, having its injunctive potency suppressed by the fact of the Action having been enjoined by the Brāhmaṇa, should serve the purpose recalling the action thus enjoined, or vice versa.
tasmānnaivamabhidhāyakatvasiddhiḥ /	Therefore the noninjunctive character of Mantras cannot be taken as established in the above manner.
ye pyājaḥ	Some people assert that, inasmuch as the Mantras are laid down by the Brāhmaṇas, as instrumental in the performance of sacrifices,exactly as the corn, &c., are, they cannot have any injunctive potency, just as the corn, &c., have none.
tairapi sāmānyatohamācaṃ vyarṣādiṣṭam /	But these people also have only been led astray by a misleading sem blance between the two cases.
vidhiśaktiniyogena na mantrasyāpanīyate	Because the mere fact of the Mantra being laid down in the Brāhmaṇa as to be employed in the sacrifice cannot do away with its injunctive potency.
vidhāyakaṃ sadapyarthaṃ brāhmaṇaṃ smārayiṣyati /	Brāhmaṇa, serve to recall that which has been enjoined by the Brāhmaṇa.
mantratastu virodhe syāditya caita dvadiṣyate api vā prayogasāmarthyānmantotantravārtika / 'bhidhānavācī syāt	As a matter of fact, however, there is no necessity of bringing in the Mantras, especially in the present Adhikaraṇa, as they have no parti cular connection with the present context. Hence we explain the Adhikarana otherwise, as follows Verbs have been declared, in the preceding Adhikarana, to be of two kinds only the Primary and the Subsidiary. And the question now started is as to whether these are the only two methods of the functioning of Verbs, or there is yet another method.
asti tṛtīyaḥ prakāro yadabhidhāyakatvaṃ nāma /	Sutra But, because of the power of usage, the Mantra would express mere denotation. There is a third methodthat of denotation.
mantragatānāṃ brāhmaṇagatānāṃ cākhyāta śabdānāṃ yeṣāṃ śabdāntareṇa vidhiśaktirapagacchati teṣāmabhidhāyakatvam /	Just consider the fol lowing Those verbs, that have their injunctive potency destroyed by the presence of such words as yat and the like words which make that which they precede, an Uddēçya, and which therefore can never be the Vidheya or object of Injunction, must, in all cases, serve the purpose of simple Denotation. That is to say, whether the verb occurs in the Mantra or in the Brahmana, when its injunctive potency happens to be set aside by the presence of another word, then, in that case, the verb must be admitted to be denotative.
tatra natā naśantītyatra nāvadyacchabdopahito vidhāyako'nuvādatvaṃ prārthayate /	Examples In na tā naçanti, &c., the Injunctive having become suppressed by the word yat, becomes supplementary.
tathā ahe buniya mantraṃ me gopāyetyāmantraṇa vibhatyā /	In ahe budhniya mantram mē gopāya, the suppression is by the Vocative end ing. Indāmi grhnāmi, it is done by the First Person ending.
yadi somamapacara yuriti yadiśabdena /	In yadi somamapahareyuh, it is done by the word yadi.
te caivamādayaḥ prāyeṇa mantreṣviti mantrā udāharaṇam/	The fact is that such instances occur mostly in Mantras and that is the reason why the Bhashya has mentioned the Mantras only specially as it is a common idea that Mantras are not injunctive.
brāhmaṇe tu bhūyomaḥ pratyayā vidhāyakāstena tadvidhāyaka miti prasiddham /	In Brahmaṇas, on the other hand, there are many Injunctive affixes, and that is why the Brahmana is commonly known to be injunctive. And it is only a very few instances where the Brāhmaṇas are not injunctive that is the reason why no Brahmana passage has been cited as an instance.
vidhāyakatvāvidhāyakatve tu tayoryathoktameva kāraṇamiti na mantratvabrāhmaṇatvayorvyāpāraḥ / tatra tvetāvān vyāpāro dṛśyate / rūpādeva brāhmāgatānāṃ vidhitvanivṛttau satyā nimittādipratyāyanārthatā /	In the matter of the Brāhmaṇa or the Mantra being injunctive or not, there is no other reason save that which has been explained above viz., the presence or absence of such words as yat and the like and the pre sence or absence of the injunctive potency is not determined by the fact of the sentence being a Mantra or a Brahmana. Motor But we do perceive the following point of difference between the Mantra and the Brahmana In the case of the Brahmana, the injunc tive potency of the verb occurring in it having been suppressed by the above causes, this Verb comes to be recognised as serving the purpose of pointing out something which affords the occasion for another action and the mere verbal form of the Brahmana is not capable of being employed in the sacrifice. In the case of the Mantra, on the other hand, as soon as we learn its formsuch as dāmi grhṇāmi, &c.
na hi teṣāṃ rūpaṃ karmasu prayogāīm /	. .
mantragatānāṃ tu rūpamevopalabhya dāmi gṛhṇāmi nirvaprāmīdamidaṃ ca karomyagnīnvihara bardistṛṇohi imidaṃ ca kurvityādikaṃ śakyametaiḥ karmma smarttumiti viniyogabuddhirbhavati	. ‘agnīn vihara, &c., &c.,we at once realise that even the verbal form can serve the purpose of recalling certain actions and hence we come to the conclusion that the words of the Mantras are to be used in the sacrifice. Because in the performance of Actions, it is necessary that there should be a recalling or remembering of certain things and inas much as this recalling cannot be done by any means other than Mantras vide Mantradhikarana Adh. I, we find it only accomplished by such Mantras as have no other function.
dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	which gave the first idea of that action, or a certain witnessing priest chiefly employed for that purpose.

niyamādṛṣṭasiddhiśca mantraireva smṛtvā kṛtaṃ karmābhyudayakāri bhavatītyavadhāryyate /	And it is also ascertained that it is only when we perform the action as recalled by these Mantras that the proper desirable results follow.

nāma kṛḍhapyuccāraṇe tatpratyayāditi na prāptatvābhiprāyeṇocyate /	interpretation of the Adhikarana. The assertion of the Bhashya Na, asakrdapyuccarane tatparyat does not refer to the fact of the Action having been already enjoined elsewhere.
kiṃ tu yacchabdopabandhādasyaiva mantrākhyātasyānyataḥ prāptamacaṃ bravomotyevaṃrūpapratyayāt /	What it means is that on account of the presence of the word yat, the verb in the Mantra distinctly says that the Mantra speaks of something laid down elsewhere.
śatakṛtvo'pi hyevamādiruccāryyamāpāḥ svasāmarthyenaiva nāpūrvapratyayaṃ karoti tata eva pūrvaprāptabuddhyu tpādāt	If the Verb, with the words yat, &c., be uttered even a hundred times, it can never, by itself, give rise to any idea of an Apūrva, and it is on account of this fact that we have the idea of the action being laid down elsewhere.
lakṣaṇena ta siddhānāmantaṃ yānti vipaścitaḥ	Explanation of the name Mantra. Sutra The name Mantra applies to those of which the purpose is Denotation.
sāmathyaṃ ceti mantrāṇāṃ vistaraḥ prāyiko mataḥ	Specially as the last Adhikaraṇa could have been discussed, without any reference to Mantras, basing the discussion upon any ordinary sentence.
pariśeṣasidvatvādbrāhmaṇalakṣaṇamavacanīyamiti sūtramidamanārabhyamiti pratibhāti /	As for the Author of the Bhashya, he has laid stress upon the order of the Adhikaranas, simply because he attached importance to the use of the word Mantra in the last Sutra. The sense of the Sutra is that the name Mantra applies to those that serve the purpose of denoting or recalling, the compound taccodaka? being explained as a Bahuvrihri.
tatra śeṣaśabdaprayogāllakṣaṇānabhidhānācca sūtravyākhyānamevedamiti draṣṭavyam /	This definition has been given here, for the sake of its terseness, specially because it is thus that it is spoken of among teachers and students and other experienced people, and also because it applies to almost all Mantras.

And the sense of this is, that without a definition, the teacher would have to undergo the trouble of pointing out each and every Mantra to his student, and this would be as painfnl a process as the curvings of the back undergone at the time when many things round ones self have to be pointed out to the standersby. On this point we have the following verses Even the great Sages, can never come to the end of all individual objects that have to be defined and it is only by means of a definition that the learned get to the end of such individuals. As an example of we have akshi të Indra pingalē dulerivā duli Tortoise.

bahukarṭakaṃ purākalpaḥ/	And at first sight the sense of the Bhashya appears to be that under the circumstances, it was not necessary to introduce the Sutra.
yatrānyathārthaḥ pratibhātaḥ paurvāparthyālocanena vyavadhāyanyathā kalpyate sā vyavadhāraṇakalpanā /	But as a matter of fact, inasmuch as we find the word rest in the Sutra, which does not give any independent definition of the Brāhmaṇa, it is clear that the above passage of the Bhashya is only an amplification of the Sutra.
tadyathā pratigṛhṇīyāditi śrutaṃ pratigrāhayediti kalpayiṣyate / vidhilakṣaṇa mityatra brāhmaṇavācī vidhiśabdaḥ svādhyāye padyamāneṣu yeṣu mantrapadaṃ smṛtam /	Question What, then, was the use of bringing in this Sūtra ?” Answer There would have been no use of introducing it, if it were known to all men that the Veda consists only of Brāhmaṇas and Mantras. As a matter of fact however, there are many people who are ignorant of this fact and since such people are liable to entertain the notion that there may be a third kind of Vedic sentence, therefore it is absolutely necessary to state clearly that all that is not Mantra, in the Veda, is Brahmana.
te mantrā nābhidhānaṃ hi mantrāṇāṃ lakṣaṇaṃ sthitam /	Sutra The character of Mantras does not belong to that which is not actually mentioned in the Veda, as it is only with reference to the sentences actually mentioned in the Veda that we have the above distinction.
kiṃ punare kasminpade ūdyamāne samastasyaivāmantratvaṃ ūhitapadamātrasyaiva veti / samastasyaiveti prāptam /	The Mantra Agnaye jushtam nirvapāmi which is laid down as one to be employed in connection with the offering to Agniis modified into Suryaya, &c., when the offering is made to Sürya and here we have an instance of modification Uha.
saṃpradāyakālāvagatarūpānyatvaṃ cetkena cidapyaṃśena jātaṃ na śakyate mantratvaṃ pratyabhijñātum / athaikadeśepi tatmabhāvābhyupagamaḥ, tataḥ sarvacaiva mantrapadā viśeṣānmantratvaprasaṅgaḥ /	And the reply to the above is that in all that is found in the Veda, only those are Mantras that have actually been spoken of as such by the learned authorities and mere denotativeness of something connected with the sacrifice is not a specific characteristic of Mantras. The whole Mantra ceases to be a Mantra, because the name Mantra is applied to a certain conglomeration of vowels and consonants arranged in a definite order and hence as soon as the slightest change C is made in this, the name ceases to apply to it.
tasmādekavarṇāpāye 'pi mantratvābhāvātma mastatatkāryya nivṛttiḥ /	That is to say, when in a Mantra the slightest part is changed from that which has been known to be its form, it ceases to be recognised as that Mantra.
ndoviṣayatvena yāvantaḥ śabdaviśeṣāḥ smaryyante tainna bhavitavyamityekapadatadavayavohe tanmantragata sarvacchāndasopodvāreṇa laukika śabda prayogaḥ karttavya iti	If it be held that the character of Mantra would reside even in a part namely that which has not been modified, then all words, even in ordinary parlance, would become Mantras, inasmuch as all of them form parts of certain Mantras. Consequently the modification of even the slightest letter having set aside the character of the Mantra, it ceases to be amenable to all processes attendant upon a Mantra. It is only the modified portion that ceases to be Mantra because the generic form of the Mantra having been ascertained to exist in a cer tain sentence, that generic character does not entirely disappear by a mere excess or diminution in a certain part of it.
na hi gorgaḍuni jāte viṣāṇe vā bhagne gotvaṃ tirodhīyate tadabhivyakti samarthāvayavāntara sadbhāvāt /	For instance, when a swelling appears on the neck of the cow, or when its horns have disappeared, it does not entirely cease to be a cow and the reason of this is that there are other parts of its body that are enough to show that it belongs to the class Cow and we find that so long as even a part of the original body remains, the whole body is recognised as the same.
sā ceyaṃ mantrākṛtirviśiṣṭa svaravarṇānupūrvyādyabhivyaktā na kiṃcidvikāradarśane nabhyatīti pratyayamupalabhāmahe /	In the same manner, it is a fact of ordinary perception that the character of a Mantra manifested by the presence of a number of vowels and consonants arranged in a definite order, does not entirely disappear on the slightest modification made in it. performance of sacrifices and in neither of these two cases, do people cease to think of the Mantras thus modified as Mantras.
yatra vacanādvarṇalopaṃ vikāra vā kṛtvā prayogaḥ airaṃ kṛtvodgeyamityādau, yatra ca svādhyāyakānadṛṣṭa caisvarthyādiparityāgenaikaśrutyaṃ niyujyate na tatra kasya cinmantrabuddhirapaiti /	It might be urged that in the cases cited, the Mantric character is not denied, because of the modifications having been made in ac cordance with directions contained in the Veda. But this explanation is scarcely satisfactory, because all that the Vedic direction does is to lay down that the Mantra is to be used particular way, and it does not declare that the Mantric character does not cease thereby. Nor is it necessary that all that is laid down as to be employed has the character of the Mantra for we find that Corns are laid down as to be employed in sacrifices and certainly Mantric character does not belong to these Corns and thus it comes to this, that the said Vedic directions lay down the use of nonMantric sentences.
syādetadvacanasāmarthyādiha nāpaitīti	Consequently it must be admitted that the nonMantric character belongs to the modified word ira and the rest, and not to the whole sentence.
yatra vaidikamanyatvaṃ tatra mantratva miṣyate /	That is to say, on looking into the Vedic direction we come to the following conclusion in that case the Mantra is of this form and in the other case of that form.
nyāyena kalpyamāne tu na śakyaṃ tannirūpaṇam	On the other hand, words like Surya are introduced in place of the words like Agni, simply on the strength of the exigencies of circumstances and reasoning and certainly no Mantric character can be ascertained by mere reasoning, and this makes a deal of difference between the two cases.
satyamūhasyāpi nāvaidikatvam /	For certainly, it is not a fact to be determined by Sense perception that a relation of subserviency subsists between any two actions.
ata evānāmnāteṣvamantratva mityucyate, vedabhāgo hi kaścitpratyacaḥ śrūyate, kaścidanumānādigamyaḥ /	Reply It is true that modification too is authorised by the Veda in fact it is for this reason that the Sutra denies the Mantric character in all that is not actually mentioned in the Veda. Of the Veda certain portions are directly perceived, while others are only inferred.
pratyakṣa śrutaścānāta ityucyate /	is only that which is directly perceived that is said to be Āmnāta Actually Mentioned.
tatra yatherāpadādīnāṃ viniyogaḥ śrūyate naivaṃ sūryyapadādīnām /	And, as a matter of fact, we do not find any direct mention of the change of Agni into Surya, as we do that of changing Girà into Irā.
nanu saurthaṃ carumityetadeva śrutisamavāyitvāddevatāyāḥ sūryyapadasya viniyojaka śrūyate / naitanmantre sūryyapadasya prakṣepaṃ bravīti iviṣastyāga kā lamātre taduccāraṇābhidhānāt /	Objection But we find the Vedic injunction Sauryam carum nirvapēt and inasmuch as the Deity is always mentioned in the text of the Veda, the said injunction would serve to lay down the use of the word Surya! Reply The injunction you speak of does not lay down the putting in of the word Surya into the Mantra as all that it does is to point out that at the time that the offering is being poured out, the name of Surya should be pronounced as Suryaya Svāhā and not that it should be introduced into the body of the Mantra, which could be done only by Atidēça Transference.
na cātideśavacananyāyanabhyatvādevāmnāyate /	And inasmuch as all sentences laying down such Transference are inferred by reasonings, they cannot be said to be directly mentioned in the Veda.
tasmādanāmnāta viniyojakatvādamantratvaṃ sūryapadādīnām /	And consequently, the use of the word Surya being found to be laid down by sentences not directly mentioned in the Veda, no Mantric character can belong to it.
syādevaṃ yadi tatsvarupamānāyeta, vacanārthaṃ tu jñātvā 'nāmnātayoreva pravaranāmnoḥ prayogāna mantratvanirūpaṇāyāmantargatiḥ /	Objection If such be the case, then, inasmuch as the Recounting of the Pravara, and the Naming of the Sacrificer, are directly laid down, they would have to be accepted as Mantras. Reply This would certainly be the case if the actual verbal forms of such Recounting, &c., were mentioned in the Veda. As a matter of fact, however, we find that the said Recounting, &c., are done in accordance with the sense of a general injunction, e.g., The PravaraRshis should be recounted, . and not in a form literally mentioned in the Veda and as such they are not included among Mantras. injunction mentions only a pronoun, if the sacrificer pronounces another name in its place, the character of the Mantra would not belong to it.
tathā nāmeti ke cit /	Some people admit that it would be so.
atha vā viśeṣāṇāmānantyādayugapatkā natvācāmnā tumaśaktaḥ svarūpasya sarvanāmaprakāreṇāmnāna mastyevetyapūṭa nyasthānatvānmantrasya śakyamevaṃ nirūpaṇaṃ kartuṃ yadatra padaṃ nivecyate tadānayaṃ mantra iti /	But the fact is that there being an endless number of individuals, and these too not all exist ing at one and the same time, it is absolutely impossible for all of them to be directly mentioned in the Veda the only way in which the pronouncing of the sacrificers name, &c., could be laid down, is by means of a Pronoun which refers equally to all nouns and it is clear in this case that the Pronoun has been put in simply because the place could not be left blank and hence that the Mantra actually contains the word the name that is being brought in in place.
itarathā hi sarvanāmnāmaprayogāītvādyadi viśeṣāmnānameva tattanopāyeneti na gṛhyate, tatastadaṃśanyūnatvānmantrasvarūpasya vyarthameva sarvanāmāmnānaṃ syāt /	Otherwise, the Pronouns not being capable of being used, in case they did not serve the purpose of mentioning the particular names to be subsequently brought in, the place in the Mantra now occupied by the Pronoun would be left blank and the form of the Mantra would be deficient in that part, and the use of the Pronoun would be absolutely useless.
pravaranāmadheyavadeva tu vidhānāttadavakāśasthapadaprayogaḥ kalpyate /	And the injunction of these being in the generic form, like those of the Recounting of the Pravara, &c., we assume the use of words in the places left blank.
tasmādevamādonyāmnātānyeveti mantradharmaiḥ saṃbadhyeran /	And thus we find that such words are actually directly mentioned and as such they could very well be endowed with the properties of the Mantra.
na ca brāhmaṇena rūpaṃ darśitaṃ yena pravacana lakṣaṇatvānmantratvādhyavasānaṃ bhavet /	The specific names of the Pravara, &c., on the other hand have not the slightest trace of themselves at the time of the actual reciting of the Mantra because the Brāhmaṇa passage dealing with them, do not make any mention of the specific forms of these names and as such, we could not attribute to them the Mantric character, even on the basis of the fact of the newlyintroduced names being explanatory to the Brahmana.
ataśca vikṛtiṣvabhidhānārṣacoḍhakābhyāṃ sakane mantre prāptei yāvanmātramarthābhāvāyā vanyatpraścipyate tāvanmātrameva laukikam / avaśiṣṭaṃ tu tathā prāptameva kratvākātipratyabhijñāyamānamantratvaṃ ceti na prāyaścittacchāndasaprayogairvajjainīyamiti siddham	Consequently, in the case of the Subsidiary Sacrifices, there being a chance of the whole Mantra being employed, in accordance with the denotation of the Mantra itself, as also the injunctions of certain Rshis, certain other words are thrown into it, on account of the absence of certain conditions of the original Primary sacrifice, and the presence of new ones and it is only these words that are of the character of ordinary parlance, and not of that of the Mantra the rest, however, is just as it was originally laid down, and is actually recognised as a Mantra required by the Sacrifice and consequently this latter cannot be absolved from the processes of accentuation, &c., conse quent upon Vedic character nor would a mistake in this be free from the expiatory rites.
teṣāmṛgyatvārthavaśena pādavyavasthā	Sutra Among the Mantras, the name Rk is given to those wherein there is a division into metrical feet, in accordance with the limitations of the meaning.
pramaktāna prasaktyāpatitammṛgādilakṣaṇābhidhānam / śabdārthasya vṛddhavyavahāragamyatvātkṛte 'pi talakṣaṇe tanmūlamabhiyuktopadeśadvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Though the definition of these various classes of Mantras has got no direct connection with the subjectmatter of the Adhyaya, yet the Sūtras treat of them, because a consideration of these is connected with Mantras, a consideration whereof was introduced in connection with the question as to their primary or secondary character. Inasmuch as the meaning of words is cognisable through the usage of old experienced people, even though the definition has been given by the Sutra, yet the Bhashya speaks of the teaching of trustworthy persons as the very root of all verbal denotation.
nanu cāgnimīlaityapi samastā yā ṝca evārthavattvānnaiva pratipādamartha paryavasthati iti na vāyamarthavaśena pādavyavastheti / kathaṃ na vācyam agnimīle purohita miti tāvatpratyakṣaṃ samāpto'rtho dṛśyate /	In the case of the Rk Agnih pūrhvēbhhih &c., there is no verb in the first foot, and as such, there being no sense completed within division into feet in this case is in accordance with the metre and not the meaning. the Objection In the case of the Rk Agnimile &c., also, inasmuch as the whole Rk contains the expression of a single sense, the sense is not completed in each foot, and consequently in this case also the division into feet cannot be said to be based upon the sense. Reply Why cannot it be said to be so? In the first foot of the Rk we actually find the completion of a single sense. And as for the in completeness of the sense of the other two feet, as a matter of fact, those two also are not incomplete as the sense of them also is completed by the supplying of the verb ile.
etasya tu pradarśanārthatvānna vṛttavabhavyāvṛttirityaniṣidbaṭakkam	Hence it is rightly said that in this case the footdivision is in accordance with the meaning. The Bhashya does not mean that in this case the footdivision does not depend upon the exigencies of metre.
gītiṣu sāmākhyā	Sutra The name Sama is given to songs.
teṣāmityanuvarttate	Or, it may be that the examples I have been cited here, with a view to show that...
ekakhaṇḍena śabdena viśiṣṭo yatra gamyate / viśeṣaṇasya vācyatvaṃ tatra sarvatra jāyate	just as, even though there are many attributes in the Curd and in the Sugar, yet the words sour and sweet only express the peculiar tastes of the curd and the sugar respectively, so in the same manner, the word Sāma expresses only the capability of being sung. Objection In the case of the curd and the sugar, inasmuch as their taste is perceptible by the senses, any teaching of trustworthy . persons on this point can be merely descriptive, and as such can have no special authority.
śeṣe yajuḥ śabdaḥ	Definition of Yajush. Sutra To the rest, the name Yajush is given.
śeṣe brāhmaṇaśabda itivatsamastaṃ vyākhyeyam	Sūtra Also, because of being named differently. The word va serves the purpose of taking exception to the sweeping assertion made in the last Sutra.
nigado vā caturtha syād dharmavi śeṣāt	G Nigada would be the name of a fourth kind of Mantras because of its qualification being other than those of the preceding three.
śeṣe yajuḥśabda ityetaḍyāvarttanārtho vāśabdaḥ / caturthaṃ mantrajātaṃ nigaḍhaḥ syāt dharmānyatvāt / yadi tāvaduccainniṃgadeneti vidhistato yajurddharmavādhī mā bhūḍhityarthāntaratvam /	&c., we find the number of the kinds of Mantras distinctly mentioned as three only and we find that in the Veda, the word Nigada is used as identical with Mantra it is quite possible for the Nigada to have its peculiar qualification, and to be named differently, even without renouncing the character of Yajush and the aforesaid definition of Yajush is found to be quite applicable to it for these three reasons, the Nigadas must be regarded as Yajush. Sutra It is on account of the fact of the Nigada being employed in indicating to others that the peculiar qualification of the Nigada is mentioned. The sense of the Sutra is that the loudness of the Nigada is mentioned simply because, if uttered slowly, it would not serve the purpose of indicating to others for which it is uttered.
athānuvādaḥ sa naiva prāpnoti vyatirekeṇa vineti bhedaḥ	unless this were addressed to other people, the action of walking round the fire by the Agnidhra priest would not be accomplished and there would be no use of addressing, unless it were done loudly enough for others to hear it is for this reason that the particular qualification loudness is mentioned.
vacanād dharmmāviśeṣaḥ	It is in this way too that the etymology of the word Nigada becomes explained.
nyāyaprāpto caimmanuvāḍhatvajñānānna vidhānāditi vyākhyātam / yaṃ tvete 'rthaṃ vadanti tamupāṃśutvena śaknuyurvaktumiti vacanādityucyate	As for the quiet utterance, though it is directly enjoined by the Veda as belonging to all Yajush, yet as such utterance would hamper our purpose, it could not rightly form part of the Action and hence we take that injunction to refer to the Yajush other than the Nigadas.
guṇārtho vyapadeśaḥ	Sutra The different naming is simply for the purpose of expressing the particular qualification.
brāhmaṇa parivrājakavadbhupena vyapadeśabhedaḥ /	That is to say, the difference in name is to be explained as being similar to the assertion Feed the Brāhmaṇas with curd, and the Parivrāja kas with milk where the Parivrajakas also are Brahmanas, but with a ith mill particular qualification.
sarveṣāmiti cet	Sutra Objection The name Nigada would apply to all.
atiprasaṅgadvāre guṇasya vyapadeśanimittatāṃ vyabhicārayati anyato'vagate 'rthe hi loka vākyaṃ pravarttate /tantravārtika /	That is to say, if the word Nigada be explained as that which is recited loudly gadyate, then all Mantras would become Nigadas because the Rk and the Sama Mantras also are recited loudly and hence the name cannot be said to be for the purpose of expressing a par ticular property. Sutra Reply Not so, because of their being distinctly named as Rk. There can be no such incongruity as mentioned above because we find Vedic texts laying down in certain cases the use of the Rk, after having denounced the Nigada as for instance, in the sentence Ayajyä vai nigadāh.
nityavākyādhigamyatvādyathā vākyaṃ pravarttate /	And if both Rk and Nigada were the same, then these texts would enjoin the same thing that they had denounced and this is an impossibility.
vedārthastadasiddhesta na vākyasyārthavaśyatā	Nor is there any incongruity in the signification of the root gada because what it does is to denote a particular property of sentences that have the char acter of the Yajush and as such it could not apply to the Rk and the Sama.
vedavyākhyānapravṛttasya jaimineḥ kaḥ prasaṅgo laukikavākyacakṣaṇābhidhāne /	Because in ordinary parlance we find that a sentence is used with regard to the object that has been cognised by other means of knowledge and it is only in such cases that we can ascertain the singleness of that object and as such it is in such cases that we can easily recognise the fact of the sentence being one.
vaidikavākyalakṣaṇasyāpi bhedalacaṇe kaḥ prastāvaḥ / kimarthaṃ pramāṇalakṣaṇaeva noktama /	That is to say, just as to say, just as the objectSentencedenotes another object, in the shape of the Meaning, so the propertySingleness of the sentence would denote the propertySingleness of the meaning. It has also been declared elsewhere Inasmuch as the meaning of the Vedic Sentence is always cognisable by means of the sentence, the functioning of the meaning of the Veda is always in keeping with the sentence and hence, as without the sentence there would be no meaning, the Vedic Sentence cannot be said to be controlled by the meaning ? a Against the above interpretation of the Sutra, we urge the following arguments When Jaimini is engaged only in the explanation of the Veda, by what connection would he lay down the definition of an ordinary sentence? As for a definition of the Vedic sentence also, what connec tion could it have with the chapter dealing with Differences among Actions.
ekaśabdaśca na vaktavyo 'rthaikatvādākyamityetāvataiva siddhatvāt /	Why should not he have mentioned this definition in the chapter first dealing with the Means of Knowing Dharma? There was no use of mentioning the word one because the definition required would have been complete by merely mentioning that so long as one sense lasts, it is a sentence.
kathaṃ ca mantrādhikāre tadasaṃbadbortho'bhidhīyate / bhāṣyakṛtaśca praśliṣṭapaṭhiteṣu yajuḥsvityupanyāsaḥ pramāṇavānapi vinā kāraṇenātikrāntaḥ /	How is it that in the course of dealing with Mantras, the Sutra proceeds to lay down something wholly unconnected with it? We find the Bhashya expressly supplementing the Sutra with the qualification among the yajush that are found to be read in close contiguity and this supplementing being quite reasonable, we see no reason why it should have been passed over in favour of another interpretation.
ṛvasāmayostāvatparimāṇaṃ prayogasamarthaṃ prasiddha miti na kaśvidvākya lakṣaṇāde kavākyatālaṇādopakāro bhavati /	And further, if the Sūtra went about laying down a definition of the singleness of a sentence, having left off the treatment of Differences among Mantras, where either in the Mantra, in the Brahamana, or in ordinary parlance could such a definition be of any use ? As for the Rk and the Säma, the limit of these is well defined by the capability of each being used in connection with sacrifices and as such in the case of these, no useful purpose could be served by a definition either of Sentence or of its singleness.
tathā brāhmaṇe'gnihotrādivākyaiḥ sādhyasādhanetikarttavyatāvatyāṃ bhābanāyāṃ niyukteṣu puruṣeṣvekāneka vākyajñānaṃ vopayujyate /	So in the case of the Brāhmaṇa, the passages laying down the Agnihotra, etc., having effectually led the persons concerned to the accomplishment of the particular Bhavana, as endowed with the three factors of the Result, the Means and the Process, where would there be any use for a due knowledge of the character of the sen tence or its singleness? www It might be urged that the use of such knowledge would lie in the avoiding of syntactical splits.
nanvayamupayoga, ekavākyatālaco vākyabhedaṃ paricariṣyati / dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	But even this use is not possible because a syntactical split is nothing more than the incapability of the sentence to have two distinct predicateson the ground of such double predica bility necessitating the repetition of certain words,etc. and this in capability is always ascertained independently of all knowledge of the singleness or multiplicity of the sentence.
padatadekadeśatamamahāvṛttiprasaṅgātmakasta dvibhāgalakṣaṇo vā vākyaikatvanānātvajñānanirapekṣaireva doṣatvenāvadhāryate /	That is to say, the repetition of a word, or of a part of a word, or of a number of wordsor the cutting up of the word itselfis known to be an anomaly, by people, independently of any knowledge of the singleness or multiplicity of the sentence. And in the case of the breaking up of the word there are yet other anomalies, viz., the necessity of rejecting the perceptible connection between the members of the sentence and that word, and also that of assuming various unheard of potentialities of the words concerned.
vibhāgannaśraṇe gamyamānasaṃbandhaparityāgo 'nekādṛṣṭa kalpanā ca doṣaḥ itaratrāvṛtteraveḍhatvādaprāmāṇyam, iti naikavākyalakṣaṇenārthaḥ /	For these reasons we conclude that no useful purpose is served by a definition of the Singleness of a Sentence in the matter of Vedic sentences. In the case of the sentences of ordinary parlance also, inasmuch as all usage is actually found to be carried on, independently of any defi nition, any such would be of no use at all.
yadi cārthekatvena vākyaikatvamavadhāryyate vākyasyāryapratyāyanārthatvāttatsvarūpaikatva jñānottara kālabhāvinā kiṃ vākyaikatvajñānena/ vaktṛṣṇāṃ ca parapratyāyanārtho vākyaprayoga iti nātmārthaṃ lacaṇajñānāpekṣā /	And further, if the singleness of the sentence were to be ascertained by the singleness of the meaning expressed by it,then, inasmuch as the only purpose served by the sentence is to bring about the cognition of its meaning, after this meaning, and also its singleness, has been duly cognisedwhat would be the use of a subsequent cognition of the single ness of the sentence itself ? As for the speakers, their sole purpose is to express a certain fact to other persons, and for their own sake, they have no need of any such definition, While as for those hearing him, when the sentence addressed to them treats of something wholly unknown to them, for them, there is not much difference between such a sentence and a Vedic one while if it treat of something already known to him, then it is a mere repeated description, and as such no importance is to be attached to it.
kimarthaṃ ca vaidikānāṃ lakṣaṇaṃ noktam / yadi tvarthāpatyoktameveti tanna /	So in any case, even an ordinary sentence does not stand in need of such definition. Then again, if the Sutra be taken as embodying a definition of the ordinary sentence, wherefore should it not have laid down one of Vedic sentences also ? It cannot be urged that the definition of these also has been implied through Apparent Inconsistency.
tyātalamabhidhāyārthā pattyā laukikavākyasiddhirātrayitavyā /	Because the proper process would have been to directly lay down the definition of Vedic sentences, and then to imply, by Apparent Inconsistency, that of ordinary sentences.
na cārthāpattiḥ saṃbhavati/ na hyetalnau ki ka vākyalakṣajñānamīḍaśena vaidikavākya lakṣaṇena vinā nopapadyate/ na cai tasyāpi vākyatā siddhā, vākyaikatvavaśenārthaikatva lakṣaṇātantravārtike /	As a matter of fact, however, no such Inconsistency is possible in the case in question because it is not such that a know ledge of the said definition of ordinary sentence is not possible without a implied definition of the Vedic sentence. Further, it is not yet established that what you point out as the definition of Vedic sentences as implied by Apparent Inconsistency, really applies to such sentences because what the definition does is to bring forward the fact of the singleness of the meaning being based upon that of the Sentence. Then again, inasmuch as it is quite possible to believe the original definition in the Sutra itself to pertain to Vedic sentences and not to ordinary sentences,o or that the defini tion of Vedic sentences may be something entirely different, there is no inevitable Inconsistency in the matter.
atyantaviprakṛ॒ṣṭaṃ vā kiṃ cihnavedityāṅkitatvānna niyogato 'rthāpattiḥ/ na ca parisaṃkhyā, māmānya viśeṣabhedānupādānāt /	Nor can the definition be said to have the character of Parisankhyā that is to say, it cannot be said that the definition, while applying to ordinary sentences, also serves to preclude Vedic sentences as having the contrary character, because there is no mention made of the relationship of the general and particular.
yadi hi sāmānyenedaṃ khanaka cidabhidhāya punaḥ kevanapai/rugheyasaṃbaddhamucyeta tataḥ parisaṃkhyāvaśena vaidikānāmiṭaṃ tāvanna bhavatotyetāvanmācaṃ gamyeta /	That is to say, if it were so that the general definition had been mentioned, and then that definition were subsequently pointed out. as applying only to ordinary sentences, then alone could it be concluded, through Parisankhya, that the definition in question does not apply to Vedic sentences.
na tu laṇaviśeṣo'nekopalavāt /	But the definition in question cannot be said to be a particular one because in that case there would be many irregularities.
evamapi hi vipayakalpanaṃ saṃbhavati, arthānekatvādekaṃ vākyaṃ nirākāṅkṣaṃ cedribhāge syāditi / atha vārthakatvānnānāvākyatvamiti /	On the other hand, we can, quite reasonably, lay down the contrary proposition that Because of the multiplicity of the meaning, the sentence is one, specially when it is such that on being separated, there remains nothing wanting in it or that Because of the singleness of the meaning the sentences are many.
tasmādakalpaneyam /	Consequently none of the above posi tions is rightly tenable.
kathaṃ cārthānapeśatve vākyaikatvaṃ prasidhyati /	C Further, how can the singleness of the sentence be ascertained independently of the meaning ? for certainly any such singleness of the sentence is not cognisable in the mere verbal form of the sentence.
na hi varṇasvarūpeṇa jñātenaitannirūpyate	For when a certain number of letters not having their meanings known, are found to exist in one as well as in many sentences, we never come across a cognition of any limit of the sentence.
tasmātpadveṣu yāvatsu śrūyamāṇeṣu dṛśyate /	ba For these reasons it must be concluded that those words, on hear ing which we are clearly cognisant of a single meaning, must be taken as forming a single sentence.
vispaṣṭa maikyamarthasya tāvatāmekavākyatā	And it is only this definition that is not found incompatible with the character of any sentenceeither ordinary, or of the Mantra and Brāhmana.
padārthaiḥ paḍhavijñātairvā kyārthaḥ pratipādyate / lokaminna tatrāsti vākyaikatva nimittatā	It has been urged above that, prior to the cognition of the sen tence, there is no idea either of its meaning, or of its singleness. And to this we make the following reply The meaning of the sentence is always signified by the meanings of words as known in the ordinary world and hence it cannot be said to be brought about by means of the singleness of the sentence.
bhāvaneva ca vākyārthaḥ svakāraka viśeṣitā / tasyāśca jāyate nityaṃ bhedaḥ śabdāntarādibhiḥ	another, it is solely from the connection among these wordmeanings, that there follows the cognition of the meaning of the sentence made up of those words, independently of any functioning of the words towards this latter cognition and it is from this that it is concluded that so many words form a single sentence and towards this result we find nothing that is contributed either by the sentence or its singleness.
tantravārtike /	And in this explanation there is nothing that is incongruous.
yātratā padasaṃghena smāryate yāgasādhanam / tāvadyajuśca vākyaṃ ca vaktavyatvānnirūpyate ekārthatvaṃ padasya myātmākāṅkṣāvayavaṃ na tat /	Now then, that which forms the meaning of the sentence in the Veda is the Bhavana, qualified by its accessories and differences in the Bhavana are always found to be cognised by such means as the presence of another word, and so forth vide next Pada. That is to say, in the case of a collection of words, where we do not find any other Bhāvanā expressed by such agencies as the presence of another word and so forth, we conclude that the sentence is one only and thus its multiplicity would always depend upon the denotation of other Bhāvanās. Consequently, inasmuch as both of thesesingleness and multiplicity are recognised by other means, the singleness of the sentence cannot be any reason for the singleness of the meaning.
sākāṅkṣāvayavaḥ saṃghastasyaiko'tha na vidyate	Nor can it be urged that each Yajush could be distinguished by means of the directions contained in the Brāhmaṇas which always mention the opening word of each Yajush.
dvitīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda / bhedo nāma padārthānāmavacchedaḥ parasparam /	Because the Brāhmaṇas do not contain directions with regard to all Yajush nor is the rule that the beginning of the second Yajush means the end of the first found in the Veda it is only a rule that the author of the Sutras themselves have made with reference to directions contained in the Brahmanas.
sa ca pratipadārthatvānnaikatvaṃ pratipadyate ākṛtiparthapa śaktatvagotvayoḥ svarūpeṇābhihitayoḥ sa vidhānāditaretarānūrañjanamartha sadbhedaṃ vākyārthaḥ /	As a matter of fact, we find that in the case of all Mantras, there is always in the first instance, cognised a directionin the form this Mantra is to be employed at sacrifices inferred from the context in which the Mantra occurs. It is after this that,it being realised that the Mantra cannot, directly by itself, be utilised in the sacrifice, we conclude that it helps in the completion of the sacrifice by the pointing out of its auxiliaries in the shape of the Deity, etc.. It is for this reason that it has been said in the Bhashya that that collection of words which serves to recall the auxiliaries of a sacrifice is one Yajush, and it is also known as a sentence Vakya, because it has to be emer out pronounced or recited.
sa ca gove śuktatvasaṃsargaḥ śuklatve vā gotvasaṃmargaḥ sāmastyenai keka vyaktyu pasaṃcārādupacabhyataiti nānā/	That is to say, it is possible for the word to have a single denotation in the shape of the Class but it is not such that when its component letters, roots or affixes are separated, there is any element wanting in it because in that condition the word is absolutely without any power of signifying anything.
yadyapi ca kathaṃ cid dvipade ma e vobhayatrāpi saṃsarga ityekatvaṃ gamyeta, tathāpi bahupada yena yena pradeśena paḍhadayaṃ saṃsṛjyate tena tena saṃsargarūpeṇopalavdhera nekatvam /	The opponent says in the Bhashya The word pada here has only one meaning and in this he further explains what he means, the sense of it being this When apart from the signification of the word there is no signification of the sentence, as one impartite whole, then Distinction and Connection, as signified by the sentence, would only be the properties of the significations of the component words themselves, they being recognised as belonging to them, on account of extreme proximity. With a view to all this it has been said in the Bhashya Even then the signification would not be one only because by Distinction is meant the mutual differentiation or specification among the words and this cannot be one, as it is different with each word.
yāvaddhi prayojanaikatvaṃ nāśrīyate tāvatsvatantrāḥ paḍhārthā naikatāmāpādayituṃ śakyante iti pṛthageva bhedasaṃmargāvanubhavanti /	In accordance with the theory that words signify Individuals, all individual cows being spoken of by the word Cow, all that the qualifying words white, etc., can be said to do is to distinguish them from the black and they cannot serve the purpose of signifying the connection of whiteness with the indivi dual cow and as for the connection of this qualification, this being in cluded in the signification of the word, it cannot form the meaning of the sentence and hence what is cognised is only the distinctness of the objects siguified by the words, in which the said connection enters as a secondary element.
a tasmādapi nānā /	And for this reason also they would be many.
yadyapi cāmmākamākṛtipadārthakatvānnaiva bhe dī vākyarthatvenābhipretastathāpi pūrvapakṣavādinā vikalpamātregopanyastaḥ /	Though for us, who hold the Class to form the denotation of a word, we do not hold the said Distinctness to form the signification of a sentence such signification being held only by the upholders of Apoha the Bauddhas,yet, inasmuch as the Purvapakshi had brought up that also as an alternative, there is nothing incongruous in our accept ing it for the sake of argument.
evaṃ matyeka eva kaścitpadārthaḥ pradhānabhūtarūdviśeṣaṇatvanetaropādānamiti sarveṣāṃ ca tadbhedāttatsaṃmargāccai ko bhedaḥ saṃ sargo vetyapi śakyaṃ vaḍhituma tasmātkamamavāyitvena dṛṣṭārthatvādaśeṣamavitrādi padārthaviśiṣṭa nirvāpaprakāśanaṃ samastasya paḍhamamūhasyaikaṃ prayojanamiti siddhamudāharaṇam /	And as for the explanation of the Siddhānta itself, this is very rightly done by taking the word artha in the Sutra in the sense of purpose and in this it is not necessary for us to accept the Apoha or any other theory contrary to our tenets. Thus then, it is also possible to declare that it is only the object denoted by a single word that is the principal factor, and it is only as the qualification of that object that everything else is mentioned and as such on account of the Distinctness and the Connection of that object there can be only one Distinctness or Connection.

But, as a matter of fact, we find that this cannot but be the predominant factor, as it serves a distinctly useful purpose while as for Savitr, etc., inasmuch as these do not form part of the action, they are only subservient to the action of Nirvapa and hence all the words have one and the same purpose namely that which is served by the Nirvāpa.
mavicādīnāṃ cākarmasamavāyādityekārthatvam /	A In this connection it is shown that the single purpose of pointing out the division of the Cake is served by the words indepen dently of one another.

nirvāpadattottarāpi vibhāganānātvaparicodanā saṃhatya viśeṣaṇānupādānātpunaḥ punaḥ prayuktasyānuṣaṅgadoṣābhāvā dupanyasyate/	Though the objection as to the multiplicity of the Cakedivision has already been answered before, yet it has been brought forward again, with a view to show that there being no qualification collectively mentioned, as the word vibhajatu is repeated, there is no fault of the aforesaid anushanga i.e., there is no necessity of carrying the same vibhajatu from one place to another.

And we have already set aside all chance of the pre dominance of the Accessory and hence any specifications due to the accessory, not forming an integral part of the action, cannot be regarded as significant and hence both the sentencesbhago vām vibhajatu and aryamā vām vibhajatumust be taken as only expressing the Division in general and as such both being found to serve the same purpose they would come to be taken as forming a single yajush, if we left off the second condition in the Sutra.
danādaraṇīya iti sāmānya prakāśanādekārthatvam / tasminmīdatyasya pūrvāpeścitve matyapi prayojanameda dvākyāntaratvam /	In the case of the sentence varhirdēvasadanam dāmi tasmin sidaif we leave off the first condition, then, even though the latter sentence tasmin sida is dependent upon the former, yet, the purposes served by the two being distinct, they are taken as two distinct sentences which would not be possible if the serving of a single purpose were not laid down as a necessary condition.

Because the direction of its use being wholly verbal, it would be necessary to assume an imperceptible result as following from such use and on this score it is the assumption of the least possible Imperceptible Result that can be permissible and when a single purpose being thus assumed for the whole, if they would be separated, they would be found wanting in some element and as such both the conditions of the previous Sūtra being fulfilled, the sentence must be regarded as one.

And how do you account for the plural number in klriptih in the direction klriptirvācayati where we find each hope klripti mentioned distinctly as ayurme kalpatām, prāno me kalpatām if all of these hopes were taken as forming a single sentence, why should there be the plural number in klriptih ? which distinctly lay down each part of the w To the above question we make the following reply It is quite possible for a single Mantra to be spoken of by means of several words contained in it, and we have klriptih in the plural, because the word kalpatam is often repeated.

We have already shown above that there is nothing wrong in assuming many imperceptible factors, or results, provided that we have sufficient authority for such assumption. And, as a matter of fact, we find that at the time that the text of the Mantra Ishe tvā,etc. is ascer tained, we have no idea either of the fact of its various portions being dependent upon one another, or of all of them serving a single purpose.
naitadevam tiṣṭhatu tāvatprayojanakalpanam, viniyogavākyaṃ vā, na hi ta duttarakālaṃ svarūpanirūpaṇaṃ yuktam /	And for this reason there being nothing against the conclusion that each part is distinct by itself, even subsequently we do not find any ground for taking them as one only. Nor is it possible for us rightly to assume a mutual interdependence among the several parts, when no such dependence has been actually perceived. to serve a single common purpose, yet as one of the two chief conditions of syntactical unity would be wanting, the whole Mantra cannot be taken as a single sentence.
tatkālāvadhūtabhedābhedānuvartitvaṃ tu prayojanaviniyogayoḥ / pramāṇavaccānekamapi kalpanoyamityuktam/	And hence it is all the more impossible for it to be taken as one when we find that the text of each part being different, there is a different use laid down for each and the uses of these being different, even though they may bring about imperceptible results, the purposes served by the various parts cannot but be distinct.
tvatpakṣe'pi cāvaṇyaṃ yāvadviniyogaṃ tena tena bhavitavyam /	Our opponent also will have to admit that there must be a distinct purpose with each direction.
iyāṃstu viśeṣaḥ / tava samastānmantrānmama vyastebhya /	The only difference then between us is that while you hold all these results to follow from the whole Mantra, according to us each of them follows from each distinct part of the Mantra.
na caiṣāmahaṭārthatvaṃ brāhmaṇopadiradṛṣṭārthaṃ sādhanatvāt /	Nor, in our case, is it necessary to assume any imperceptible results as following from each part of the Mantra, as each of them actually serves distinctly useful purpose laid down in the Brahmaṇa.

Or it may be thatas in the case of the Brāhmaṇa direction that the Mahendra hymn is represented in the rumbling of the chariot, even though the rumbling is not significant of auy meaning, yet, at the peculiar time, by the mere remembrance of the Brāhmaṇa direction in question, people recognise the rumbling as the actual singing of the hymn,so, in the same manner, on account of the Brāhmaṇa directions in connection with the Mantra Ishe tva, etc., the various parts thereof ishe tvā, urjē tvā, etc.would bring about the idea of cutting,etc. and in this case it would not be necessary to supply the word chinadmi.

If, however, it is not found in of these, then it should be looked for in the word preceding or following it immediately. If it is not found in the immediately proximate word, then it is looked for in another word, a step or two removed from the original word.

In all cases, when we do not find the missing factor in a sentence close to the incomplete sentence, then we can bring it in from one removed from it.
nānyatrotmahate gantuṃ vaidikaṃ sannibandhanam/	But in case one happens to be found much nearer, the bringing in of a remote sentence is as unauthoritative as if it were nonVedic.

Because that sentence appears in the place that it does, only with view to point out that it forms part of the next sentence also and a due consideration of its capabilities and its position in the second Mantra is regulated in accordance with that in the previous Mantra. The sentence being actually mentioned only once, it is absolutely impossible for it to be mentioned in that part of the subsequent sentences where it is required and hence it is mentioned in its due sequential order in connection with one Mantra only and as for the other two, its indication is just enough to show that it forms part of these also.

Having arrived at this conclusion, however, the Bhashya proceeds to offer another explanation Ap ca sākańkshasya sannidhau, etc.,the sense of this being that when the missing factor will have been introduced in the second Mantra, it would immediately come to precede the third Mantra also, and thus there would be no intervention.
tatra kaiśvikhyānavikalpa evetyāśritam /	Some people hold that the Bhashya has mentioned the two explana tions as equally correct, and as such optional.
apare tu vadanti pūrvatrāparitoṣa duttaraṃ kṛtam	But others declare, that not satisfied with the former explanation the Bhashya has offered the second.
samudāyatvaṃ hyekakārthyatvenai ka śabdopādānena vā bhaveta, nacācaikamapyasti /	The reason for the said dissatisfac is as follows The two sentences have never been composed by any person as a single composite whole and if they were so, we do not see any reason why they should have been again composed separately. That is to say, any two sentences can be taken as one composite whole, either when they serve the same purpose, or when they contain the same words.
aho nu khalu mantrāṇāṃ kāryaṃ vijñātam / apekṣā hi tatrobhayoḥ syāt / kathaṃ tatka/rthyamityucyate /	It may be urged that they actually have the same purpose in the shape of being completed by the same sentence. But one who brings for ward this argument would evince, on his part, a grand conception of the functions of Mantras ! The being completed by a sentence would only con stitute a want on their part,how could it be an action or purpose of theirs? And as the sentence supplied is only a missing factor, on the sole strength of this, it is not proper to speak of the two Mantras as forming one composite whole.
śeṣaścāsau tayornna tahaśena samudāyatvāpattiryuktā /	And when you also subsequently come to acknowledge its relationship with each Mantra separately, we do not see how you can make a single composite whole of the two Mantras.
yadi sa samudāyatvamāpannau tataḥ punaḥ pratyekaṃ saṃbandha iti rājaikaputrakrīḍā ''padyate /	The assertion that connected with the missing factor, would be as unbridled as the freaks and tricks of a single and favourite son of the king. And further, in that. case, because the missing factor precedes the composite whole, it would have to be added in the beginning.
na vā gṛhyamāṇaviśeṣatvaṃ deśabhedanimittaṃ nantrabhadāt /	Nor can it be rightly urged that there is no difference between the relative positions of the Mantras with regard to the missing factor.
prathamasya hyasau yathākācite deśe sthito notarayoḥ /	Because there is a distinct difference of locality which makes a difference in the relative position of the Mantras for instance, we find that the missing sentence is actually found, in the first Mantra, in the same place that it is required while it is not so in the other two Mantras.
tasmādidameva vyākhyānam	For these reasons the only explanation that is reasonable is the following Akanksha Want, Sannidhana Proximity and Yogyatā Capability, these three conjointly constitute the ground of relationship, and not mere immediate sequence.
yo hi bahūnāṃ saṃbandhitvena sakadāmnāyate tasyāvaśyaṃbhāvye kenānantaryyamiti na tadeva tadā saṃbandhakāraṇatvenāśrīyate /	That which, being one, is yet mentioned as related to many things, must be in closer proximity with only one of these and it is not this proximity alone that is accepted as being the only ground of relationship. Because even in this case, the relationship is based upon all the aforesaid three grounds and not upon mere immediate sequence.
manāpyasmādeva kāraṇacayātsaṃbandha siddheḥ /	What the Proximity does is to give rise to a mis taken notion as to relationship, on account of its bringing about an idea of its own substrate.

Just as the idea of Bhavana being denoted by the verbal root ceases on account of the capability of the Bhavanā to take up the accessories that can never belong to the meaning of the verbal root.

sannighiriti buddā viparivṛttiḥ / sā cānantarye saṃbaddhapadavyavāye ca bhavati /	By the wordsannidhi in the Bhashya is meant the moving about in the mind and this is possible when there is immediate sequence as well as when there is an intervention.

evaṃ vākye paḍhānāṃ prakaraṇe ca vākyānāṃ saṃbandho yāvatmākāṅkṣeṇa tatsaṃbandhāṇa parasyāpyanantarīkarttu' samarthena vyavadhānam /	Thus then, the relationship of words in a sentence, and that of sentences in the context, remain intact, so long as all the intervention that there is, is only by such words as are themselves wanting in a certain element, are capable of the same relationship, and are capable of making the other sentence also equally proximate to the factor of relationship.
avyavadhāne viccheda pīti/	Says the Bhashya Avyavadhäne viccehēdepi and the sense of this.
virodhinā padenāvyavadhāne viprakṛṣṭatve bhavati saṃbandhe ityarthaḥ /	is that when there is no intervention, even though there is no proximity, the factor becomes related, so long as the intervention of a sentence at a distance is not by means of a word which is contrary to such relationship.

anuṣajyataityanuṣaṅgaḥ sa eva samāpyate teneti samāptiḥ tantravārtika /	The concluding words would have become fully satisfied by being construed with the sentence that immediately precedes them because all the other sentences being complete in themselves, there would be no reason for admitting of an Anushanga.

But as it is, they are found to be related only to the verb punātu and as such they cannot but be construed with all the three sentences as all of them contain that same verb. That is to say, independently of any immediate sequence, the words in question become related to the verb punātu and as this verb is the same in all the three sentences, the meaning of this verb too must be the same in all.
kiṃ prātam	Nor is the action concerned ie., of purifying subservient to the instrumentality of acchidra pavitra whereby it would rest satisfied with its single contact with such instru mentality.
uccate ānantaryyaviśeṣeṇa dyayaṃ punātvityetena saṃbadhyate /	The following argument might be urged here Though the action of purifying is one, yet, that which should be connected with the instrument, is the Action which is qualified by that nominative, in connection with whom the relationship of the Instrument is found to be mentioned directly.
sa pcaika eva triṣvapi vākyeṣu, tadekatvā cārthasyāpyekatvam /	Because, as for the Instrument, it is used up in serving the purposes of the Action and hence by means of the expression of the Instrument, it is the same action that comes to be expressed over and over again. And the action being the same in all the three cases, it stands, in each case, in need of a mention of the Instrument.
na ca kārakabhedāttasya bhedo bhavati /	Nor is the Instrument due to the Nomina tive and as such, a difference in the Nominative could not necessarily make a difference in the Instrument because all cases of nouns being taken up by the verb, they have no relations amongst themselves.
yena citpatyādisaṃbadvādasyānanyatvaṃ vijñāyate/	Objection In that case the instrument in question would have to be construed with the word punātu in whichsoever Mantra it might be found.
na cācchidraṃphetyevamarthā kriyā, yena sakṛtsaṃbandhena saṃtuṣyet śravaṇānāṃ vyavasthā hi bhinnāpūrvaprayuktitaḥ /	That does not touch our position Just as in the case of the Darçapurna māsa sacrifice certain purificatory rites are laid down in connection with the grass therein used and they are not applied to t the grasses used in all sacrifices, so in the case in question also, the particular instrumen tality mentioned would not belong to any and every punātu all that it would mean would be that the instrumentality of the acchidra pavitra belongs only to that action of the word punātu, which is meant in this particular context.
tasmātpunātuśabdo 'yaṃ sarvamantragato'pi san / drātaḥ sarve punastāna pecyate tantravārtike /	Thus then, we conclude that though the word punātu occurs in all the three Mantras, yet being in all cases taken up by the instrumen tality expressed by the wordsacchidrena pavitrēna it is always as qualified by that instrumentality that the Verb punātu comes to be wanted in all the three Mantras.
vyavāyānnānuṣajyate pratyudāharaṇatvena sannidherevamucyate / asaṃbandhatirodhāne vaiṣamyānnānuṣajyate	Sutra There is no Anushanga where there is an inter vention of unconnected words. This Adhikarana is brought in simply by way of a counterinstance to the functioning of mere Proximity in the matter of the Anushanga. As it is found that where the intervention is by words not connected with the factor to be brought in, we do not accept an Anushanga in view of the incongruity involved.

tatra śabdāntaraṃ sāvat spaṣṭatvātprathamamudāhiyate / ekānekākhyāta pratyayasaṃbaddhāḥ sarve dhātavo yajati dadāti juhoti nirvapati gṛhṇāti stṛṇāti śaṃsati staiauti ityevamādaya udāharaṇam /	The use of this discussion lies in the fact that, if certain words formed an Anushanga, they would form a Mantra and as such any mistakes, etc., in the pronunciation of these would have to be accompanied by expiatory rites whereas if the words supplied are out of ordinary sentences, they do not constitute a Mantra, and hence any mistakes in pronunciation, etc., are not so serious as to entail an expiatory rite. To this end it has been declared that that which is directly mentioned in the Veda, and that which is brought in by means of an Anushangu, are counted as having the character of Mantras, where as all sentences of ordinary parlance, being similar to assumed sentences, can never be recognised to have the character of Mantras.
dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	Thus ends the First Pada of Adhyâya II. PĀDA II. Sutra When there is a different word, there is a different karma, because of its being specially qualified.
bhāṣyakāreṇa tu svatvaparityāgāṃśena yajatyāditrayaṃ pratyāsannārthatvātsutarāmabhinnamābhāsataityudāhṛtam / tatra pūrvapakṣacaividhyadarśanātsaṃbhayopanyāsopi tadanuguṇaḥ pratibhāti /	And first of all we take up the differences caused by the difference of expressions, because it is this difference that points out most it is this clearly the difference among actions. In connection with this we should have cited the examples of all verbal forms connected with one or many verbal affixessuch as yajati, dadāti, juhoti, nirvapati,etc. The Bhashya has cited only threeyajati, dadati and juhoti, because, inasmuch as all these denote the giving away of something, their significations are all akin, and as such they naturally appear to have identical meanings. And on this point, inasmuch as there are three kinds of Purvapaksha introduced in the Bhashya, it seems as if the doubt on the point in question should also have been expressed in three ways.
tadyathā /	such these latter three are spoken of as helps to the former three respectively.
tisro bhāvanāḥ kimekamapūrvaṃ kurvanti uta cīniti, tathā trayo dhātvarthāḥ kimekī bhāvanā viśiṣanti uta tisraḥ, tathā trayo dhātavaḥ kimekaṃ dhātvarthaṃ vadanti uta cīni, ti /	As a matter of fact, however, there is only one doubt in connection with this subject In the case of the three verbs, is there only one Bhāvāna as qualified by the denotations of the three roots, or is there a distinct Bhavana for the denotation of each root? What the word kärma in the Sutra denotes is the Bhavana as qualified by the denotation of the root.

Though the unity of three rootmeanings spoken of in the Bhashya is not possible in the case of all rootmeanings, yet it might be mentioned, somehow or other, in connection with the roots yaji, etc., in question but in the case of these, though it may be possible, yet much stress should not be laid upon this unity.
atha vā pāramārthiko'trāyamekaḥ saṃśayaḥ, kiṃ dhātvarthacayānuraktaikā bhāvanā, atha vā pratidhātvarthaṃ bhāvanābheda, iti /	Vide Says the Bhashya Atha va yajetētyētasya purvo bhago,etc. And the sense of this is that the words denote a single Bhavana as qualified by the denotations of the three roots. In support of this we have the following arguments Inasmuch as in all verbs it is the denotation of the Affix which is the Bhāvanā that is the predominant factor, it cannot, as such, be different with each Root inasmuch as the Root meanings are spoken of as subservient to that denotation of the Affix, they must be taken as collectively qualifying it.
bhāvanaika dhātvarthānuraktā karmaśabdenocyate /	pointing out the qualifications of the Bhavanā.
tasyā eva śabdāntarādi bhedakaṃ bhaviṣyati, apūrvasyāna bhidheyatvātkarmabhedānuniṣpādye va taditina pṛthagvicāramarhati /	If we met with the affix alone, as we do with Krināti in the sentence before quoted, then, though pronounced but once, it would become connected with all the roots, just as the verb krināti becomes connected with all the adjectives, arunaya and the rest. But as the Affix by itself could never form a word, no such can ever be met with and it has to be repeated.
tataścaitadapi saṃśayakāraṇaṃ pūrvapaśavādinaḥ pratibhāti, kiṃ dhātvarthānpratyupādīyamānā bhāvanā pratyekaṃ samāpyate, athavā te tāṃ pratyupādīyamānāḥ saṃhatya viśiṃṣantī, ti/	It is only this second statement of the Purvapaksha that is the correct one and not the former one, which was based upon a combination of all the Bhāvanās. Because when the Bhavanas are distinct, their results, the Apūrvas, must necessarily be many and because the Bhāvanās could not be taken as forming a single collective whole, unless they be expressed by a single word. x That is to say, if the Pūrvapakshi admits the Bhavanās to be distinct, then, inasmuch as this distinctness could not be possible without their resultant Apūrvas also being distinct, he would have to admit these latter also to be distinct and many and then what useful purpose could be served by the statement of the Pūrvapaksha? And we can admit of a collective whole being formed of many individuals, only under two conditions, viz.
tatra samudāyaścikīrṣitaḥ samudāyādekamapūrve na vā śābdaḥ samudāya ityādiṣu punaḥ punaḥ samudāyaśabdoccāraṇādapūrvekatvābhidhānācca tisṛbhyo bhāvanābhya ekamapūvaimiti pūvaḥ pacaḥ /	a when we find that many are spoken of, subse quently, by a single name e.g., having laid down three sacrifices, the Veda concludes with one who performs this Paurnamāsī sacrifice, etc., where we find the single name Paurnamasi applied to the previously enjoined three sacrifices and b when many actions are found to conjointly lead to a single result e.g., one should offer the Rajasuya if he desires the Kingdom of Heaven, where the name Rajasuya is given to a number of sacrifices, which together lead to the specified result. In the case in question, however, we find none of these two conditions and as such we cannot admit of a single collective whole being made up of the three Bhāvanās. Objection But we do meet with the sentence jyotishtomēna,etc. from which it is clear that a single composite whole is formed by the yajati,etc. Reply But it is not so because the word Jyotishtoma identifies itself only with the root yaji to sacrifice and as such it would point to the sacrifices only.
iyaṃ vopapattiḥ	For these reasons the former representation of the Purvapaksha is not tenable.
dṛṣṭaśrutavirodhe tu satyadṛṣṭaṃ prakalpate / ekrena cāvirodhitve siddhe nāneka kalpanā /	And further the Bhavana, having primarily appeared in connection with one rootdenotation, this denotation, as based upon Direct Denota tion, would be the most authoritative of all, and as such it would never admit of any optional alternative qualifications in the shape of the denotations of other Roots.
tadevāca	And so also with the other words yajati, and the rest.
pratyayārthapradhānatvātpratidhātu na bhidyate /	B Question When the Bhavana would be mentioned by the word “ dadāti,” it would be directly recognised as the same as that which was previously expressed by the word yajati and as such it is not right to assert that the relationship of the word dadati with that “Bhāvana would depend upon the syntax and the context.
tatropadīyamānatvādvātvarthaḥ saṃhatāḥ punaḥ	Question But in the case in question, there is no ground for holding a multiplicity of Individual Bhavanas.
pramiddhe bhāvanābheda bhāvyabhedo niyogataḥ / na cāso samudāyatvameka śabdyādineṣyate	Then again, in the case of the word, we have such agencies as those of sound and the like, which, being distinct from the Word itself, make unreal any such distinctions of words as into the Short,etc. whereas in the case in question, the sacrifice,etc. which are signified by a part of the same word as the Bhāvanā are neither removed nor totally distinct from the Bhāvanā itself and as such the distinctions based upon those sacrifice,etc. cannot be said to be unreal.
yathā raktopadhānena nirudve sphaṭike sati / kṛṣṇādicodanāyuktaṃ gamyate sphaṭikāntaram	In support of this we have the following When a piece of rockcrystal has been spoken of as red, the mention of black could not but be taken as referring to another piece of crystal in the same manner, when one word has spoken of the Bhavana as connected with one Rootdenotation, the mention of other Roots could not but be taken as referring to other Bhāvanās.

It is for this. reason that we never come across the pure denotation of the Affix by itself. It has also been declared that the terminations, Accusative,etc. appearing from out of nouns, always show that the denotation of the noun is their qualifier.
prayogavākyaśeṣabhāvena hi samudāyasya sattāsaṃbandha iti /	Says the Bhashya Prayogavākyaçeshabhāvēna hi samudayasya sattā sambandhah the collective whole is believed to exist only on account of the supposed Directive Sentence that recapitulates all the subsi diaries as belonging to a single Primary.

And what the supposed Directive Injunction does is to take in only those Actions whose particular forms have been duly ascertained and thus when once the distinct form of each of the Actions has been ascertained, they come to be recognised as distinct from one another and then it is not possible for them to be unified into one composite whole.

Nor can the word yaga be said to indirectly indicate the Dana and the Homa, because that would entail the word yaga renouncing its own signification for if the word yaga were to signify the sacrificing and at the same time indicate P C the giving, then we would have the absurdity of Direct Denotation.
tasmānna samudāya kalpanāsti /	For these reasons there can be no reasonable assumption of any combination.
ataśca dhātvanyatvena padānta ratvātkevaviśiṣṭatā gamyate /	Thus, then, the fact of the roots being different making the words themselves different, it is cognised that the Bhavana is qualified by the RootDenotation.

na ca dhātvaryaikatvamā, secanapara svatvāpāḍhanābhyadhikatvāt/	Nor again can the denotations of all the three Roots be said to be identical, because while yuga means the mere giving up of ones own ownership, Homa means this giving up plus the pouring into fire and Dana means the creation of the ownership of another person over and above the giving up of ones own.
na ca tyāgamātralakṣaṇā svārthavṛttitvenāpi vākyasamavāyopapatteḥ /	Nor can it be A Saps action WA held that Dana and Homa indicate the mere giving up of ones own ownership because the Direct Significations of the words are quite compatible with the sentences in which they occur and as such there can be no ground for having recourse to Indirect Indication.
na ca dāviṇāni nāma guṇaḥ kaścitprasiddha iti sāmānādhikaraṇyānnāmadheyatvameva yuktam /	Nobody knows of any such material as the Dakshinani, and hence on account of the word occurring along with juhoti which denotes the action of Libation, we must accept it to be the name of an Action.
ataśca vākyānarthakyaṃ mābhūditi homo vidhīyate /	And then, with a view to avoid the sentence becoming absolutely meaning less, we accept the Homa to be enjoined by the word juhoti.

Sutra The repetition of the same word also is a means of differentiation because if there were no such specification, the repetition would be useless.
śabdāntarādhikaraṇapratyudāharaṇarūpeṇābhyāsasya pūrvapakṣaḥ sukhamabhidhīyataiti tadanantaramārambhaḥ /	by means of different words, what comes in the mind foremost is the idea that there can be no such differentiation when the same word is repeated and hence it is that the Bhashya now introduces the Adhikarana with this Purvapaksha.

This way of putting the question, however, is objected to by some people, as follows The words samit, etc., could be taken either as names of actions, or as expressing accessories of actions and as these two facts would duly differentiate the actions laid down by the sen tences in question, the mere repetition of the yajati would have nothing to do with that differentiation.
ṣaḍapi bhedahetavaḥ pṛthagbhūtāḥ svasāmarthyamācavyāpāraphalā darśayitavyāḥ, tadyāvadatra guṇanāmadheyayorbhedakaratvaṃ nāpanīyate na tāvadabhyāsasya parabhāgalābho'stītyanyadudāharttavyam/	There are six means available for the differentiation of actions and each of these should be shown distinctly as functioning in due accordance with the special capability of each consequently in the case in question, so long as we have not set aside the capability of the Accessory and the Name to differentiate actions, it is not possible for the Repetition to have any influence in the matter, which rightly lies within the jurisdiction of others.
dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	And hence, we should cite another example.
nanvevaṃ sati saṃjñāguṇayorabhedakatvapramaṅgaḥ / tatra to bhedako yatrākhyātapaḍhana vyāpriyate tathā codāhariṣyati /	As a matter of fact, however, n example is possible, because, in the whole Veda, a verb is never used alone by itself and whenever a noun happens to be used, it must be either as a Name or as an Accessory and so there would be nothing in the way of differentiation left to be done by the Verb. For instance, in the case of all such sentences as aindravāyavam grhnāti and the like, we find that the Actions mentioned in them differ from one another, on account of the fact of each of those Actions being intimately connected with a distinct Accessory of its own.
taccākhyātasya bhedaśaktau vihatāyāṃ bha batauti tadeva tāvatprathamaṃ parokṣyate /	they are regarded as different from one another, as shown under Sutra IIiii And in this case, as each juhoti serves the purpose of con necting the action of Homa with each particular occasion, it cannot be said to be useless and as such, it cannot be the means of differentiating the Actions concerned.
kimekamapūrvamiti phastutaḥ karmabhedābhedopanyāso, yadā kimekaṃ karmāpūrvaṃ codayacyuta pañcāpi karmaṇyapūrvāṇīti /	Some people quote, as an example of the differ entiation by Repetition, the sentences Pancaçaradiyeshu tan paryagni kṛtān, tân paryagnikṛtān, etc., but they lose sight of the fact that the repetition in this case is merely descriptive of the same Primary Action and as such no differentiation is possible nor do we find in these sentences the word yajati, a repetition of which would express a difference among the Actions.
kiṃ prāptamekamapūrvamiti /	And hence we conclude that no example of differentiation by Repetition is available.
C yathaiva yajatiśabdaḥ sakṛtpratyakṣeṇāvagataḥ punaruccāraṇesa eveti pratyabhijñānānna bhidyate/	We base our reply to the above sideobjection to the Bhashya, on the very sentences that have been quoted by the Bhashya. As a rule, when ever a Noun appears in connection with a Verb, it is almost always sub servient to this latter and hence it is the Verb, as the predominant factor, to which belongs the capability of expressing the difference or non difference of Actions.
yacca vedo 'vabodhayati tanmātrameva tatpramāṇavādibhirabhyupagantavyam / tadihaikaśabdenābheda vedenāvagamite yo 'nyatvaṃ kalpayati tena veda evāpramāṇīkṛtaḥ syāt /	That is to say, those nouns that express an object of predication are subservient to the Verb, and as such, always following in its wake, they stand in need of the functioning of the Verb. Hence when the Verb has entered into the Primary Action, the noun also becomes either a name of the same Action, or mentions an Accessory for it and if the Verb points to an Apurva, then the noun also belongs to that Apurva and thus the difference or nondifference of Actions having been duly recognised by means of the Verb, the words Samit and the rest, coming in subsequently, become useless and indifferent as regards the pointing out of the said difference or nondifference and it is for this reason that we leave aside these words, and take into consideration the Verb only.
na ca pramāṇāvagatamānarthakyaṃ doṣāya/	Question In that case, the Name, and the Accessory would never be the means of the differentiation of Actions.
yathā śākhāntarīyeṣu jyotiṣṭomādivākyeṣu /	Answer Certainly they would serve the purposes of this differentia tion, in cases where the Verb does not operate towards it the examples of such cases, to be cited later on, are athaisha jyotih,etc. and vājibhyo vājinam,etc. .
na hi samānakāryatvena brohiyavayore kasyā nartha kyā darthāntara sādhakatvaṃ vijñāyate / atha vā tanūnapāḍhādidevatā vidhānārthatvānnānarthakāṃ karmavidhāne hi sati nāmadheyatvaṃ bhaveda, nuvāde tu nāmadheyavidhirna saṃbhavatīti guṇavidhitvaṃ tasmādapyakarmāntaram/ yatrāpi ca pradeśāntara tāveva śabdārthoṃ/	In the latter sentence we do not find any verb and in the former, though we do find a verb, yet, inasmuch as it is possible for it to become related to the Primary Action by way of serving to point out the connection of the particular Result with the particular Accessory, the differentiation required will have been done by the names jyotih, etc., which have a prior operation. sible, there is laid down an Accessory not otherwise possible and in this case too the differentiation is done by the Accessory as it will be shown in the Adhikaraṇa dealing with the Accessory as the means of differentia tion, by the Bhashya after accepting the facts brought forward by the opponent this connection of the Deity and the Sacrifice being enjoined etc., etc.,etc. the sense of which is that the sacrifice having been enjoined in a previous sentence, what the repetition of the same does is to point out its connection with an Accessory, in the shape of the Deity.
yadi ca pratyuccāraṇamarthānyatvaṃ bhavettadā 'nityavyaktiśabdārthatvapramaṅgaḥ	But a differentiation by the Accessory is possible, only when the Verb is found to have lost its differentiative potency and hence it is only right that first of all we should consider the Verb as the means of differentiation.
ākhyātapratyayaḥ pūrvaṃ vidhatte karmaśaktitaḥ / anyenākṣiptaśaktistu tadākāṅkṣatyanūditam	Further, on the utterance of the first sentencesamidho yajuti an idea of the Action yaga presents itself to the mind and hence when the same Verb is pronounced again, the Action denoted by this is at once recognised as the same that had previously come to the mind and as such the repetition does not point out any difference in the Action.
tasmādiha vidheyayāgavyaktiphanatvopāttasāmānyaikatva nimittaiva pratyabhijñānabhrāntiḥ /	That is to say, when the word yajati has been once directly heard, if it happens to be pronounced again, it is at once recognised as the same word that had been previously heard, and no difference is perceived between the two words so also in the case of its denotation which being comprehended once is always recognised to be the same, whenever that word is uttered.
yadaca paramārthena pratyabhijñāyate tadekatve na kaściḍivādastathā ci nanu cātra yaji śrutyaivaika karma vijñānānna vaktavyaṃ sannidhikṛtamevaikatvamiti/ naitadevam	And in the case in question, all that the second yajati, though directly heard, does is to express over again that. same Action of yāga which has already been cognised by means of the first yajati and though, as such, it becomes redundant, yet it cannot make the two yajatis distinct words and in the same manner, a repetition of the word, even though becoming otherwise superfluous, could not make the meaning of one yajati different from that of the other. For certainly superfluousness like Inconsistency is not a, C means of right knowledge.
vyaktayo hi vidhīyante sāmānyenopalaścitāḥ /	Only that which the Veda lays down should be accepted as the authoritative means of knowledge, by people taking their stand upon the authority of the Veda.
tataḥ paraṃ na bhedosti prāktasmādbhedaniścayaḥ na ca yatra pratyakṣeṇa kevalena bhedo'vagamyate tadevaikaṃ bhidyate / śabdasyāpi prāmāṇyā viśeṣāt ato'tra śabdāntarādiṣaṭkāvadhireva bhedo 'vadhārayitavyaḥ /	And in the case in question, we find that the Veda, in using the same word yajati, distinctly points to a nondifference between the Actions and hence he who would hold them to be different, would be going against the authority of the Veda itself. And as a matter of fact, there is nothing wrong in the admitting of the superfluousness of certain words, if such superfluousness happen to be necessitated by a higher authority. But we have the following ways of avoiding the said superfluous The word yajati as repeated in the second and the following sentences, being touched by the supposed Directive Injunction dealing with the Primary Action together with all its subsidiaries, could be taken as not affording any meaning, but only as laid down for the sole purpose of being verbally repeated.
nanvekāhatvādīnyapyavāntara sāmānyānīṣyante / na, kālaviśeṣayogādeva daṇḍyādivadabhinna śabdapratyayapravṛttisiddheḥ /	And in this way there would be no repeated mention of the Action of yaga. We actually find that in ordinary parlance, people go on repeating certain words by way of emphasisingeven more than twiceuntil the idea meant to be conveyed by them is fully compre hended by the person to whom the words are addressed.
śrathāpyavāntara sāmānyāni punaḥ karupyante, tathāpyasmatpaścāvirodhaḥ /	So also, in the scriptures, we find, in course of the story of Pancendra, that the old spinster asks for a husband five times.

Thus then, as when many words have the same mean ing, they come to be taken as optional alternatives, so we conclude that it “is the same sacrifice that is enjoined, at one time, by the sentencesamidho yajati, and at another by the sentence tanunapatam yajati.
nanvevaṃ mati jyotiṣṭomagrahābhyāsavatmamidādiyāgābhyāsaghvakarmāntaratvaprasaṅgaḥ /	of the Samit, because in this case we do not have any composite whole made up of these performances as we have in the case of the Jyotishtoma. And thus the conditions of the two are not identical.
sarvathā tāvadaparvamedāirmavyavasthāḍhīni si dhyanti, tathāpi tu yeha karmabhedabuddhigrahayāgeṣu cābhyāsabhedadvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	The Bhashya has quoted all the Injunctions of the Sacrifices, in connection with the DarçaPurnamāsa and then the question started by it is as to whether all the sacrifices enjoined are distinct primaries, or it is only some of these that are so. The question of the relation of subserviency between Actions, however, can in no way be connected with the subject of the present Adhyâya. Specially as we shall devote way. A a great deal of time and trouble for establishing such relations among Actions under Sūtras IViv. And the bearing of this Adhi other any karana being quite clear, it cannot be explained in Conse quently the question of the relation of subserviency between Actions.

etaujjñānasya ca prayojanaṃ paśusomādhikaraṇe vacyāmaḥ /	Nor do we know of any such namesas Paurnamāsya or Amā väsyaas belonging to any particular sacrifice.

It may be argued that the sentence quoted only lays down the times at which the verses have to be recited, and they do not refer these verses to any actions. But, we ask, what would be the use of laying down the connection of the verses with any particular time? Nor can the fact of the words Paurnamāsyām and ‘Amāvāsyāyām having the locative ending be urged against us because we actually find many instances where sacrifices mentioned by words with locative endings are accepted as primary e.g.
tatra tatprakhyaṃ cānyaśāstramityevaṃ samidādipadānāṃ kramaviniyuktaiva liṅgamantravarṇakalpitadevatāsaṃbandhadvāreṇa nāmadheyatve sati avidheyatvānnāsti vidhiśaktyākṣepa iti vaktavye devatāyāgasaṃvandha vidhānopanyāsobhyupetyavādena /	And thus we find that in whatever way we might get at the Yājyā, the apparent inconsistency of the declara tion in the Vedic text Vārtraghni paurṇamāsyām etc.,of the relation ship between the Mantra and the Sacrifice, leads us to conclude that in the two sacrifices, Agni and Soma are the Deities concerned. Then as for the Ajyabhagas, from which the Mantras indicative of the Deity have been separated, their Deities are already mentioned by a sentence in the form of the Purakalpa ArthavalaYasyaikasyaicit dēvatayai havirnirvapunnajyasyaiva nau purastudyajan. Then as far the Mantras in connection with the Ajayabhāgas, the Yajyas have already been laid down and these have not been separated from them, and the Anuvākyā Mantras that have been removed elsewhere also would come in, in accordance with the direction daçatayibhyah kartavyah and thus there.

That is to say, in all cases, where we have the Injunction of an action with a name, these two being recognised to be coextensive, it is sometimes the particular signification of the root yaji sacrifice which is defined or specified by the name while at other times it is the sacrifice that defines or specifies the name.

na bhede ca dṛṣṭasāmarthya samaprādhānyasiddhaye / kathaṃ śabdāntarābhyāsau hetutvenopavatā	To the above, we make the following replyIt is the Base and Affix i.e., the compound Darçapurnamasa and the dual termination taken as a joint whole, that can specify or qualify the root Yajati in the case of the Agnèya etc., on the one hand, and the Ajyabhāga etc., on the other, each of these is devoid of any connection with one part of the word.

tasmādyajyanurodhena nāmā/ nirūpyate vāccakālayujo yāgāḥ prakṛtāḥ manti ke cana /	as a whole is incapable of applying to the Agneyaetc. And also, though we find duality in the Ajyabhaga etc., yet the Base Darçaparna māsā is absolutely inapplicable to these and so the word as a whole cannot apply to these either.

kasmātpunarimāvevāpūrvī pūrṇamāsyamā vāsyāsaṃghakī hai/ yāgau phakhāya na vidhīyete/	Question Why can not we take the sentences Ya enam vidvān amāvāsyāyām yajate and ya evam paurnamasayām. etc. as laying down these two independent sacrifices for the accomplishment of the result? For, even in accordance with the Siddhanta theory, these two words yajate will be said to lay down these two as composite actions made up of the six primary sacrifices towards the fulfilment of the particular result.
tathā hitantravārtika /	It might be urged that the expression Darçapurnamāsā being different.
siddhāntepi ta yāgābhyāṃ śabdābhyāmanukīrttita/	from the expression Amavasyapaurnamasa, the actions referred to in the sentence mentioning Svarga as the result could not be recog nised to be the same as those mentioned by the two Yajates in the sentences in question.
tāveva samudāyau hai/	But this objection is equally applicable to all parties.
vidhāsyaṃta phalaṃ prati	For instance, for the upholder of the Purvapaksha also, what are meant to bring about the result are the two composite sacrifices.
na hyaṣṭānāṃ kālasaṃyoge satyavadhāraṇe heturasti, yenānayoreva phalasaṃvandhaḥ syāt /	That is to say, when all the eight are equally connected with the particular time, there is no reason for attributing the result to the two only. It might be urged that from among these eight the result might be attributed to any two sacrifices. That is to say, unless we find a special reason for doing so, as long as we find the relationship of the specified time equally present in all the eight sacrifices, those two that would be chosen out as leading directly to the result, would make all the other six subsidiary to them and inasmuch as these six have all the marks of primary actions, there would be a very great anomaly.
eteṣāṃ madhye yayoḥ kayośiyataphala saṃbandha iti tadayuktam vinā viśeṣahetunā yāgatvakāla saṃbandhasāmye sati yāveva gṛhītau tatraivetareṣāṃ prādhānyaprāmāṇyabhājāṃ satāmaṅgatvāpāढ़nāt viruddhatā syāt /	might be urged that the said importance being a matter of option, it could, by turns, be attributed to all the pairs concerned but in that case, there would be another anomaly, viz., the same sacrifice would at one time be the primary, and at the other subsidiary and further, from among those having the characters of both the primary and the subsidiary as it is only that which is subsidiary in the Agneya that is said to be capable of being introduced into its corresponding Prayāja, a certain sacrifice would, in its subsidiary character, be liable to be introduced in the corresponding Prayajas of the Agnèyaetc. while the same would, in its character of the primary, be incapable of being so introduced and thus there would be an eternal doubt as to what should be really introduced into the Prayajas.

In accor dance with the Purvapaksha, however, this is not possible because, inasmuch as it does not admit of any composite sacrifices, the number two can not in any way be applicable and hence it could never admit of the result to follow from any two sacrifices and hence the result must be attributed to each and every one of the sacrifices mentioned in the context.
yathā siddhānte samudāyagata dvitvāpeścayā ṣaḍ vidhāmyante / neharśanāsphuṭena prakṛtayāgamātrāvalambyākhyātaṃ śakyaṃ nivarttayitum /	The following question might be put to us Why cannot we have all the eight sacrifices, as qualified by the duality of the times Amāvāsyā aud Purnamasi, as enjoined by the sentences in question in this case the duality pertaining to the points of time and not to the sacrifices ? Just as in accordance with the Siddhanta, we have the six primary sacrifices enjoined with regard to the duality of the two composites V To this the reply that we make is that such hazy processes can not set aside the verb from each and every one of the sacrifices mentioned because it actually rests upon every one of these.
na cātyantavyatirekātkālagatā saṃkhyā yāga sāmānādhikaraṇyanirdeśā bhavati /	And then, too, the time being something entirely different from the sacrifice, the number belonging to the former can in no case appertain to the latter. In the Siddhanta the case is different as according to that, there is no absolute difference between the component parts sacrifices and the two composite wholes to which latter the number belongs and as such there is nothing incompatible in connecting the number of the whole with the component parts.
tasmātpūrvapace yajivaśenaiva nāmapadavṛttera viśeṣeṇa sarve yāgāḥ samapradhānāḥ /	Thus then, we conclude that, in accordance with the Purvapaksha, as the application of the names Darça and Paurnamāsa depends upon the signification of the root Yaji, all the sacrifices in question must, be admitted to be equally primary..
prakaraṇaṃ paurṇamāsyamāvāsyā saṃyuktayorālambanaṃ syāt /	To the above, the Sutra makes the following reply Prakaranathat which is performedwould be the substratum of the words connected with Paurnamasya and Amavasya or the context would help these two words and consequently we must accept that alone to be enjoined which is denoted by these.
prakriyataiti prakaraṇam / athavā prakaraṇaṃ tayoḥ sahakāri bhavettataśca tanmātrapratipādyo 'tha grahītavyaḥ / kutaḥ	That is to say, in all cases, we find that the Injunctive word prompts us to certain specific sacrifices and in case the sentences ya ēvametc. are taken as enjoining independent sacrifices, as they do not make any mention of the material or the deity related to these sacrifices, people would never be found to take up the performance of such unspecified sacrifices.
na hyanena yajinā paurṇamāsyamāvasyāpaḍhābhyāṃ vā yāgamātre buddhiḥ kriyate/ na ca prakṛta karmagracaṇaṃ tvatposti /	That is to say, the words yajate in these sentences, or the words Amavasya and Purnamāsa, do not denote sacrifice in general nor do you who hold the sentences to lay down two independent sacri fices admit of these words pointing to all the sacrifices in question. Then all that you can do is to make them lay down two independent sacrifices. But in that case, inasmuch as the details material deity &c. of these sacrifices are not mentioned, no one would be found to perform them and hence the sentence would become wholly futile.
tataṅkaca vākyamevānarthakaṃ bhave, tprakṛtagrahaṇe tu teṣāṃ dravyadevatāyogādetatkālavarttitvācca rūpajñānādarthavaśvam/	If, however, they are taken as referring to the sacrifices mentioned in the context, then, the materials and the deities of all these sacrifices, as also the particular points of time at which they have to be performed, being found to be duly mentioned, the full form of the sacrifices becomes known and as such the sentence becomes utilised in pointing out the time at which they should be performed.
nanūktaṃ matyace 'pyasti dravyadevatamiti /	It has been argued above that the Material and the Deity of the four sacrifices are also clearly cognisable.
yathā kathaṃ cimabhyeta dravyaṃ sādhāraṇaṃ sthitam / tathāpi devatā nāstītyarūpatvānna mucyate	But though it is true that the common material, Dhrauva, might be taken as the material to be employed, yet inasmuch as there is no mention of a Deity, the sacrifice remains as indistinct as ever. Nor is it possible for the Deity to be indicated by the words of the Mantras employed because the Mantras in question are distinctly pointed out, by the Order in which they occur, to belong to the Ajayabhāgas.
yadi hi sarvalokaprasiddhaḥ kālona na samaveyāttatastadatikrameṇa karmaṇī gṛhayātām/	Because if the commonly recognised signification of time by these words were not compatible with the sentence, then alone could we reject it and take the words to be indicative of Actions.
api copapannatarā kālavacanatve sa pramī, tasya sarvacaiva kālasyādhikaraṇatvānna karmaṇodhikaraṇatvāhitopādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda /	Then again, we find that the Locative termination in the words Amavasyayam and Paurnamāsyām is more compatible with the signification of time than with that of Ac tion because Time is always known as the Adhikarana Substratum, Container of Actions and as it is not possible for Actions to be such an Adhiharana, the Locative ending, in that case, could hardly be explained in any way.
nupapatteryathā kathaṃ citkalpanīyaṃ syāt /	It has been argued above that no purpose is served by such connecting of the Mantra with any particular time.

kiṃ ca	Vridhanvati in that performed at another the Paurṇamāsī.

That is to say, in all cases, the relationship of things is ascertained means of their mutual requirements hence the Ajyabhagas, that have their Deity already known, standing in need of Mantras capable of pointing out that Deity, would at once take up such Mantras, and it would not require any very great effort on our part to connect the two. In your case, on the other hand, the sacrifices denoted by the sentences in question being altogether new, their Deities are not known and as such they do not stand in any immediate need of Mantras indica tive of those Deities hence it becomes necessary for you to make the following assumptions you will have to assume the Mantra, and its duality, thereby making the single Injunction have many meanings you will have to assume the existence of many Deities indicated by those Mantras, while it is not necessary for a single sacrifice which is held to be enjoined by the sentence in question to have more than one Deity or more than one Anuvākyā there is an assumption of a Yajyā verse not found in the Veda as also fresh Puronuvakyās, not mentioned in the Veda, for the Ājayabhāgas.
yaccaikā yājyā ekā vānuvākyā bhaviṣyatīti /	It has been declared above that one of the two Vārtraghnis, as also one of the two Vridhanvatis would be the Yajya, while the other is the Anuvakya.
na tadnavākyā samākhyābādhāt /	But this is scarcely possible, as the taking of any of these as Yajya would be contrary to the fact of their being named Anuvākyā.

ājyabhāgayoḥ punarditvātprajñāta hidebatatvācca prakāṇyā kā ḍināḥ prakāśakā mantrāḥ niṅgakrama viniyuktāḥ santaḥ ekāntena dṛṣṭārthatāṃ pratipadyante /	Deity to be indicated by the Mantra, it would be far better to assume the Mantras to exert an indirect influence towards the accomplishment of the Action On the other hand, the Ajyabhagas being two, and they also being recognised as having two Deities Agni and Soma,the Mantras indicative of those Deities are actually required by them for the purpose of lending authority to their cognition and these Mantras, being pointed out as to be used at the sacrifice, by the indications of the Mantras themselves, as also by the order in which they happen to be mentioned, they come to serve a distinct visible purpose.
tatra ca mantrataviśeṣaditvādiṣu prāpteṣu kāladdāraṇa vyavasthāmātravidhānālāghavaṃ vākyasya, na vā'narthakyaṃtantravārtike /	And thus, the Mantra and its duality etc., all having been pointed out, what remains to be done by the sentence Vārtraghnī,etc. is to lay down distinct restrictions with regard to the time at which the various Mantras are to be used and this process is certainly much simpler than that involving the abovementioned endless assumptions. Nor, in this case, does the said sentence become altogether useless because the aforesaid restriction with regard to time cannot be accom plished by mere Proximity and hence the use of the sentence lies in this restriction.
tasmānna devatāvidhira saṃbandhāt/	ana For these reasons there can be no Injunction of the Deity, through the sentences brought forward because these have been shown to have no connection with the matter.
ataśca rūpavattvāt akarmāntaratā kiṃ punaḥ samastānuvādasya prayojanaṃ, paśya uccate / yathaivotpattivākyānāṃ prayogavacanāṅgatā /	And hence the sacrifice held to be en joined by the sentence Ya evam, etc., not having its details of material and Deity clearly mentioned, it cannot be taken as one different from those previously laid down. hū~ Question What would be the use of making the sen tence Ya evam,etc. a mere reference to the other sacrificesAgneya and the rest? Because an Injunction that fails to enjoin anything expressed by a word, by its part, or by a sentence, can never be of any use in matters relating to Dharma, and hence as in the case of Reference, the sentence in question would not contain any of these injunctions, it could not be of any use in regard to Dharma.
tathaiva tadupāḍhānād dvitvasijhā 'nayorapi	Ya evam,etc. because it is these latter alone that render the Dual number in Darçapūrṇāmāsābhyam compatible with the whole thing.
ekakājābhisaṃyogādbhinnānāmapi karmaṇām / samudāyārpaṇaṃ śakyame kadaṃśasthavṛkṣavat	Question How is it possible to speak of many distinct sacrifices as one or two composite wholes? S B Answer It is quite possible just as many trees located in one place are spoken as a single composite forest, so though the sacrifices are many and distinct, yet inasmuch as they are all performed at the same time, they can very well be spoken of as a composite whole.
paurṇamāsoṃ yajataiti yajisāmānādhikaraṇyāta yāganāmadheyametaditi gamyate / na cāgneyādīnāṃ samudāye yāgatvaṃ samavetaṃ,kiṃ tarhi pratyekamāgneyādiṣu, tammādyayaivaiteṣu pratyekaṃ yaji revaṃ nāmadheyamapi /	Because it is only on account of the coextensiveness of the sacrifice as signified by yajeta with the name Darça and Purna māsa, mentioned in Darçapurnamāsābhyām , that we take these words to be the names of sacrifices and certainly the character of sacrifice belongs to the individual sacrifices Agneya and the rest, and not to the composite whole made up by these. as the sacrifice denoted by the root yaji is found to be coextensive with the name paurṇamāsī, we conclude that Paurṇamāsī is the name of a sacrifice and the character of sacrifice does not belong to any composite whole made up by the Agneya, etc., but to the individual Ãgnēya, etc., them selves and hence just as the root yaji sacrifice is applicable to each one of these sacrifices, so also is the name in question.
na ca samudāyotpattirekena kālena yuktā, āgneyādīnāmutpattikānte parasparānapeśatvena samudāyatvānupajananān/	Nor is it possible for the whole composite to appear at one and the same time, because at the time that the Agneya, etc., are performed, they are performed inde pendently of one another and hence at that time there does not appear any idea of their forming a composite whole.
tataḥ kāntavaśenāpi pratyekaṃ nāmadheyamiti śakyaṃ vaktuṃ, yadi ca samudāyinairapekṣyeṇa samudāyayorete nāmano syātāṃ tataḥ prayogavākyenāpi mamudāyo phale vidhīyatāṃ tato'vayavānāmasādhanatvātmamudāyādekamapūrvam /	And hence even in consideration of the time of actual performance, we can say that the name belongs to each individual sacrifice. And further, if the two words were the names of the composite wholes, independently of the component sacrifices, then the Directive sentence Darçapūrṇamāsābhyām svargakāmo yajēta would also lay down the composite wholes towards the fulfilment of the particular result and in that case, the component sacrifices not being the means of bringing about that result, there would be a single Apurva proceeding from the composite whole itself and thus there being no individual Apūrva with each individual sacrifice, there would be absolutely no use of performing or laying down so many distinct sacrifices.
na ca pratyeka mitikarttavyatayā S'gneyādayaḥ saṃbadhyeran / tataśca tadgatatantrāvṛttiprayogādivicārāsaṃbadvatvaṃ bhavet/	And further, the actions laid down in connection with the various sacrifices, all tending towards a single Apurva, there would be no restriction as to which action should be performed in the course of which particular sacrifice nor would each of the sacrifices be connected with any specific method of performance and consequently, there would be no use for the consideration.
na ca pratyekavikāre sauryādau samastetika taṃ yatātideśaḥ syātma istrādiśabdavaccāvayavavṛ tyabhāvāde kapuroḍāśā paiaumāsī sānnāyyaracitā 'māvāsyetyevamādivyavahārocchedapramaṅgaḥ /	in subsequent Adhyayas of the questions as to the repetition of the Actions performed in course of the Agneya in another sacrifice and further the Saurya, for instance, being a form of the Agneya, there would not be any method of performance applicable to it as there being no such method applicable to the Agneya only, the only method that would be available would be that of all the three Primaries Agnèya and the rest and as the Saurya is not a form of these three, any such method could not be applicable to it nor again could we have such declarations as The Paurṇamasi has only one cake, the Amāvāsyā is without the sannayya, and so forth because the number of cakes would be the total of all that are employed in all the sacrifices that go to form the composite whole, and that number could not be applied to the lesser numbersone, etc., because the number would be exactly like the number thousand, which is not applicable to any part of itself.
saṃghātasyācoditatvātsaṃghātasya guṇatvādityevamādiṣu spaṣṭamevaṃprakārāṇāṃ samudāyivacantvamabhyupagatam, itarathā hi sa eva śabdābhihitatvāccodyeta phalasaṃbandhācca pradhānaṃ bhavet/	We meet with such declarations asbecause of the composite whole not being enjoined, and because the composite whole is an accessory, b and so forth we must conclude that such words as those in question signify the component parts and not the whole as otherwise, being denoted by the word, it would be the composite whole that would be enjoined and as such, being directly connected with the result, that would be the Predominant Action and as such both the above declarations would be false.
tasmādupasarjanībhūtamamudāyāḥ samudāyina evābhidhīyante /	For these reasons, it must be concluded that the words Paurnamāsī and Amāvāsyā denote the individual sacrifices as qualified by the two composite wholes.
teṣāṃ tu bahatvāt bahuvacanaprasaṅgena lakṣaṇayaikavacanayoga ityabhipretya samudāyaśabdatayāvaka spiṣyata ityāha / tathā ca bhavati hi bahūnāmekavacanā tantravārtike / ntaḥ samudāyāpeśa itya peśāmātrameva samudāyasya bravīti nābhidheyatvam/	And, though, these sacrifices being many, the name would have to take a Plural ending, yet the singular number is due to the indication of the single composite whole by the individual sacrifices and it is with a view to this that the Bhashya has declared samudāyaçabdatayavakalpayishyate It would be taken as indicating the composite whole. So again, the Bhashya declaresbhavati hi bahuname kavacanantaḥ samudāyāpēkshaḥ the singular ending in the case of many things is possible, as referring to the composite whole where the Bhashya also has spoken of only anapeksha indirect influence of the compo site whole, and it does not speak of this latter as being actually signified by the word. The words crowd,forest and the like can be taken as similar instances, only when these also are taken as signifying the compo nent individuals as qualified by the composite whole if, however, they signify the composite whole, then they can serve as instances only so far as the singular ending based upon the singleness of the composite whole is concerned.
yūthavanaśabdāvapi yadā mamudāyopamarjanasamudāyivacanau tadā sākacyena dṛṣṭāntau yadā tu samudāyameva brataḥ tadā tannimittaikavacanannābhamātreṇa dṛṣṭaśantatvam / etena darśapūrṇamāmaśabdāvetatparyāyai/ vyākhyātai	And the words Darça and Purṇamāsa also following the duality of the composite wholes, come to refer to the same i.e., to the Amavasya and the Paurnamasi specially as there is much similarity between the words paurnamāsī and purnamasi and on account of the word darça appearing along with purnamāsa while Amavasya appears with Paurnamast, the word darça also comes to be synonymous with amāvāsyā. Or it may be by the figurative method of contrary expres sion that it would be easier to get at the comprehension of the Amavasya by means of the word Darçajust as the blind is spoken of derisively as one having eyes because it will be declared later on that because the moon is not seen on the Amavasyā, therefore, the Amāvāsyā is derisive ly or figuratively spoken of as darça So also at the close of the Anvärambhaṇīya sentence, it will be shown that the words darça, and amāvāsyā are synonymous.
anyathaiva hyayaṃ kānaḥ karaṇāṃśena yujyate / anyathotpattivāṛyastho nirapekṣaḥ parasparama	Thus then, the Result being found to follow from only those sacrifices that go to form the composite wholes, all the sacrifices other than these must be taken as subsidiary to them the former ones, the Agnēya and the rest, being taken as the Primary Sacrifices and as such they are not all of equal importance .

nanu dūrasthānyupakarttuṃ na śaknuvanti saṃnikṛṣṭasyairupakarttavyamityetadvā kutaḥ sarvaca, vacanānusāreṇopakārānupakārāṃśī vi jāyete /	Against this, the following objection might be urged Even this direction is absolutely useless, because the time for the performance is duly pointed out by the sentence which originally enjoined the sacrifice tence yadagneyo shṭakapalo amavasyāyām paurṇamāsyanca te cyuto bhavati. To this we make the following reply In the sentence that we have found, we find the time forming part of the means of accomplishing the Result whereas in the original Injunctive Sentence, we find it, very differently from this, connected with various sacrifices independent of one another.
nanu cā'nyenaiva vākyeneṣa tantra prayogaḥ sidhyati, yaiṣṭyā paśunā somenetyādīnāṃ tatrāpi karaṇavibhaktinideśādiṣṭeḥ svamamudāyisvāṅga sahitāyāḥ kālaṃ pratyupādānādīhabhī vivacā labhyate /	That is to say, in the original Injunctive Sentence, we find the Time mentioned in such a way that it is connected with the Primary sacrifices Agnēya, etc., independent of one another, and wholly devoid of their subsidiaries. In the sentence that we have brought forward, on the other hand, the Time is mentioned by words with the Instrumental termination and hence it forms part of the Means of the accomplish ment of the particular result and the instrumentality of these has been cognised as belonging to the Primary Sacrifices together with their subsidiaries, as connected with one another, in accordance with the Directive Sentence Durgapurṇamāsabhyām svargakāmo yajēta . and hence any further mention of the Instrumentality of these would not be necessary specially as they are laid down only with reference to the particular Time.
tathā ddi	And thus there is a distinct difference between the two ways of taking the sentences.
na tāvattrikasyeṣṭi śabdena grahaṇamityavadhāyate /	Nor does the original Injunctive sentence prohibit the performance of the sacrifices on days other than those.
tatra pratyeka yāgatveneṣṭi śabda pravṛttere ke kasyāmamāvāsyāyo paurṇamāsyāṃ vā prayoga iti na samyakprayogasiddhiḥ / atha samastānāmagneyādī nāṃ kathaṃ cidraḍheḥ pravṛttatvādiṣṭeḥ mome pravṛttiritivad grahaṇam /	Reply Whence have you got such a law that it is only when a certain thing is in close proximity with another, that it can afford any help? For it is only in accordance with the declarations in the scrip tures that we ascertain whether or not one Action will help an er. Hence until we have met with a declaration to the effect that it is only proximate objects that can render any help, there can be no authority for asserting that that which is remote cannot help. Objection The performance of the Primary together with the subsidiaries is pointed by a sentence other than what you bring forward. For instance, we have the sentenceya ishṭyā paçunā somēna yajēta sa amavasyaya paurnamāsya yajeta,where the word Ishti has the Instrumental ending and being laid down with reference to the time PE of the performance of itself together with all its Component Sacrifices and subsidiaries, the required mention of the time is got at by that Reply True, it is got but the desired performance is not accom.
evamapi prayogavacanaikatvātmamudāyadvayasyāpi paurṇamāsyāmamā vāsyāyāṃ vā 'nuṣṭhānaṃ syāt / tatra sa evotpattiśiṣṭa kāla virodhaḥ tadanurodhena vyavasthitavikalpāśrayaṇamiti cet /	Because the word ishti refers either to the whole collection of sacrifices Primaries and Subsidiaries or to each of them singly and it never refers to any trio of sacrifices consequently, a performance based upon that word would be altogether different. That is to say, it is ascertained that the word ishti does not refer to any trio and thus the word applying to each sacrifice as ishti is etymologically equivalent to sacrifice, yajña, it would follow, from the sentence you have brought forward, that each one of the sacrifices, singly, would be per formed on one Amāvāsyā or on one Pūrṇamāsī day. That is to say, one sacrifice would be performed on one Amavasya and another on another Amavasya and as such a proper performance of the sacrifices will not be accomplished.
evamapi yathotpattyanurodhātpratyekānuṣṭhānaprasaṅgaḥ / tathāṅgānāṃ bhedena paurṇadvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	But thus too, inasmuch as the Directive sentence darçapūrṇamāsābhyam svargakāmo yajetais one only, both the composite sacrifices the Darça as well as the Paurṇamāsa would be performed either on the Amavasya or on the Purnamāsi day and in this there would be a contradiction of the restriction of time laid down in the original Injunction. It might be urged that, in deference to the original Injunction and also to the signification of the sentence we have brought forward, we can accept the two points of time as two alternatives. But then also, just as in accordance with the original Injunction, each Primary.
māsyamāvāsye pracupādānābhāvādyatra ka canaikatra pradeśe 'nuṣṭhānaṃ syāt/	Sacrifice would be performed alone by itself upon a distinct Amavasya day, so also, inasmuch as the Subsidiaries are not differentiated as to some of them belonging to the Amāvāsyā while others belong to the Paurnamāsa, the performance of all of these Subsidiaries would be done in any one place only.
tasmānnaitadvākyaṃ tābhyāṃ tunyārthamiti prakṛtāva kiṃcitkaratvāt vikṛtoreva sadyaḥkālatāyai gacchati/ nanvanena tantra prayogaḥ siddhyet /	And hence, the sentence that you have brought forward cannot serve the same purpose that is served by the sentences Amāvāsyām amāvāsyayā,etc. and as such it can be of no use with regard to the Primary Sacrifices hence all that it could do would be to connect the particular time with the other modifications of the Primary Sacrifices. Objection The performance of all the sacrifices, together, as one action, could very well be brought about by the sentencesamē darça purnamāsābhyam yajeta because inasmuch as no significance could be attached to the place denoted by the word same =on level ground, all that the sentence does is to show that all the sacrifices the Primary along with its subsidiaries have to be performed together.
same darśapūrṇamāsābhyāṃ yajeneti deśasyānupādeyatvāsāhityavivaśvopapatteḥ /	It might be argued that, the common application that the sentence would imply being that on account of the peculiar relationship between the Davça and the Purnamāsa, one of them becomes connected with the level platform at the same time that the other does.
bhedenāpici prayujyamānānāmananyadeśagamanamātreṇa deśatantratvasiddhiḥ /	Because in a way the whole of this fortnight would be the time for the performance of the Primary because all that can be meant by the Injunction that the Subsidiaries should be performed at the same time as the Primary is that they should not overstep the timelimit of the Primary, and not that they should be performed close upon it because this latter would not be possible.
athetaretarayogavaśādyadaivaikaḥ samena yāgo yujyate tadaivetaropīti tantratvamucyate / tathā satiṣaṇāmapi yugapadupādānāttathaiva prayogaprasaktaḥ sa eva virodho, yadi punarutpa ttivākyānurodhena pravarttate /	And thus then, even the sentence that you bring forward would not accom darça The above arguments also apply to the case of the sentence pūrṇamāsābhyām svargakāmo yajeta i.e., even this sentence cannot serve the purpose of pointing out the time because like the place mentioned by same in the sentence brought forward by the opponent, the Result also cannot form the object of a sentence and hence what this sentence would lead to would be the performance of all the Primary Sacrificesconnected with one another and accompanied by all their Subsidiariesat one and the same time, and thus, too, the desired method of their performance would not be achieved and a single result would be brought about by Sacrifices performed at different times.
tataḥ pratyekaṃ kālasaṃyuktānī samaṃ pratisāhityaṃ saṃpādanīyamiti ṣaṭsleva paurṇamāsyamāvāsyāsu prayogaḥ samāpyeta /	Thus then, in consideration of the time prescribed in the original Injunction, we would conclude that the time of the appearance of the Result would be that time which is taken up by the actual per formance of the Primary and its Subsidiaries and that the said simultaneity would be only so far as that time is concerned and thence the completion of all the Primaries with their Subsidiaries would rest either in the six Primariesthe three Paurnamāsas and the three Amavasyas, or in the two composites Darça and Paurnamāsa only.
aṅgāni ca tāvataḥ kālādanutkṛṣyamāṇāni prayoktavyānoti yatra ka camāntarāle kriyerana	And then the Subsidiaries would come to be performed, either along with any one of the two Composite Sacrifices, or on any day during the fort night, as shown above.
yadyutpattau na vidyeta yāgānāṃ kālasaṃgatiḥ /	And unless we had a mention of the time in the original Injunction, we could never know which sacrifices are referred to by these words.
samudāyānuvādatvaṃ nirnimittaṃ na labhyate	which is not done by the sentence which is the real original Injunction of the Upānçu.
viśeṣadarśanāca pūrveṣāṃ sameṣu hyapravṛttiḥ syāt	Sutra Also because we find a peculiarity in the shape of the appearance of the subsidiary Prayāja in the modifica tions of the Primaries we cannot hold all to be equally Primaries because they the Prayājas could not appear in them the modifications if all were equal.

tasmādāgneyaguṇatvaṃ prayājādeḥ kathaṃ syāditi samudāyānuvāda	Consequently in order to establish the fact of the Prayājaetc. being subsidiary to the Agnèya and the rest, we must take the two sentences in question as referring to the previously mentioned Sacrifices.
codanā vā guṇānāṃ yugapacchāstrācodite hi tadarthatvāttasya tasyopadiśyeta	taneously because if they appeared after the sacrifices had been enjoined, then their such appearance could be only for the sake of the accessories and as such we would have to admit of an injunctive word with each accessory.
naiteṣṭā kapālādayo guṇa viṣayaḥ /	The sentencesyadagneyaetc. cannot be taken as laying down the accessories of the sacrifices enjoined by the sentences ya evametc. Be cause it is a wellrecognised rule that when the Action is one that has been already enjoined by a previous sentence, we cannot lay down more than one accessory with regard to it as it is only when the Action has not been otherwise enjoined that even a number of accessories could be laid down by a single effort of that Injunction.
karmotyattivākye hi pratyayo bhāvanāmaprāpnatvāt vidhāsumupakramate /	That is to say, in all original Injunctions of Actions, the Injunctive Affix proceeds to enjoin only the Bhavana, because it is only this factor that is not got at by other means.

And when it so happens that by the apparent inconsistency of the generic character of the auxili aries that are recognised as constituting the factors of the Bhavana,this inconsistency leads us to look for a specification of the said auxiliaries, then it is that the Bhavana comes to be specified by those specifications which are implied by the Instrumental caseendings found in the same sentence, and which also are on the lookout for the Bhavanā as the object to be specified. And in the case of each word, the Class, Gender and Number, that belong to an object, all these come to be recognised, by means of the direct signification of the particular caseending, as auxili aries to the Bhāvanā because all these Class, etc., on account of being expressed by the same word, have among themselves the relation of the qualification and the qualified, and are not recognised as belonging to, or depending upon, one another and as such must be concluded to form part of something else and that is the Bhāvanā. And thus it is that all words, near the Bhavanã, or removed from it, fall in with the Bhāvanā, notwith standing their remoteness or proximity, in the way tha that we have explained under the Adhikarana on Anushanga in the foregoing Pada of this Adhyaya.
sataḥ sarvaviśeṣaṇaviśiṣṭāmanuṣṭhānayogyāṃ bhāvanāmāmādya vidhiḥ samāpyate /	And it is only then that, having got hold of a Bhavana fully endowed with all its qualifications, the Injnnction becomes complete. And as in all such cases the Injunction lays down the qualified Bhāvanā by a single effort, it does not entail any such anomaly as the assumption of various potencies in the Injunction.

That is to say, though, as a matter of fact, the Apparent Inconsistency due to the fact of the Bhavana being qualified, appearing subsequently, leads to an idea of the Injunction of the qualifica tion, long after that of the original Injunction of the Bhavana,yet, in accordance with the rule arrived at in the Adhikardna on Akrti, as it is impossible for the Bhavana to be qualified, in the absence of the qualifica tions themselves, it must be admitted that these must have been full fledged entities from before as it is through these alone that any idea of the Bhavana being qualified could be brought about. All these Injunctions of qualifications, pointed out by the apparent inconsistency of a perceptible fact, operate either simultaneously or one after the other. And thus we find that if we admit a sentence to be the Injunction of a fresh Bhavanã, then it becomes an easy matter to get at the Injunctions of its accessories, by the help of the original Injunction of the qualified Bhavana, which is capable of giving birth to various Injunc tions. On the other hand, however if the sentence be taken as only referring to a Bhavana previously enjoined by another sentence, this is not possible.
yadā hi bhāvanā 'nyataḥ prāptā bhavati tadā tasyāḥ piṣṭapeṣaṇavatpratiitaśaktirvidhāyakastāmavidadhānaḥ na tatsaṃgatārthānekavidhivyāpāraprasava hetutvaṃ pratipadyate/	sentence in question cannot enjoin that Bhāvanā over againas a repeated injunction of the Bhavana would be as useless as the powdering of that which has already been powdered and then, not performing its in junctive function, it does not become the means of giving birth to various Injunctions with regard to things connected with that Bhāvanā as it is only when the Injunctive word enjoins the qualified Bhavana that it makes possible the assumption of such Injunctions and this is not possible in the case in question hence the Injunctive Affix is found to be such as has its direct expressive potency quite inoperative towards the injunction of the Bhavana and hence, in accordance with the rule laid down under the sutra anarthakyāt tadangeshu, that Injunctive Affix comes down from the Bhavana and directs itself towards the auxiliaries con nected with it.

For these reasons it is not possible, in this case, to have the one implied by the other, as we had.

codite hi prāpte karmaṇi tadarthatvāgaṇārthatvāttasya tasya guṇanya vidhaye punaḥ punarupadiśyetocāryeta pratyaya ityarthaḥ	This is what is meant by the second half of the sutra, which means that if the sentence were taken as laying down an action that has been already previously enjoined, as such laying down could only be for the purpose of mentioning the accessory, the Injunctive word would have to be repeated for the sake of the Injunction of each one of the accessories.

This is what is meant by the assertion in the Bhäshya that there being no relationship of the word bhavati, there is no connection of the sacrifice with agneya . If, however, the sentence be taken as laying down the Agneya with reference to the Paurṇāmāsī sacri fice, then too, we have the same difficulty of having a mention of the actual form of the Agneya and as this difficulty in both cases is exactly similar, the Bhashya has not noticed it in connection with this second alternative, and has only pointed out the fact of the sacrifice, in this case, not having connection with the ashtakapāla. Even when we take the sentence as meaning that the Agneya qualified by the Paurnamasi sacrifice is ashtakapala, or that the ashtakapāla qualified by that sacrifice is Agneya, in any case we are faced by the following difficulties the mention of the origin of that Agneya or Ashtakapāla which is described the difficulty of connecting them with the Paurnamãsi sacrifice the mention of the origin of that Agnēya or Ashṭākapala which is enjoined with reference to another and the difficulty of connecting the Agnēya and the Ashtakapāla with each other and thus the whole thing would be come too complicated.
ṇaścāpūrvasaṃyoga iti karmāntaratvam /	because that would entail the anomaly of having a qualified Injunction.
karmāntaratve ca sati tadavasthaṃ rūpāvacanamityanuvādatā/ avaśva bajādekavacanalakṣaṇādyāśrayaṇīyam /	Thus then in the sentence Agneyaetc. we must have the injunction of the connection of a material and a Deity but this connection is not enjoined by other sentences and hence, in accordance with the sutra gunaçcapūrvasambandhak we must admit a distinct sacrifice to be actually enjoined by this sentence yadagneyaḥetc. and then we have the same rupavacana nonmention of the form that was urged in the third sutra and as such the sentence ya ēvametc. must be taken as only referring to the sacrifices enjoined by the sentence yadagneyaḥ,etc. And by this we are forced to have recourse to indirect indication, etc., for the purpose of explaining the singular ending in Paurnamāsīm .
kiṃ ca navā'nanya kriyāyoge vākyametatmamāpyate na ca svārthā samāptatvādākyāntaramapekṣate	And further, the sentence yadagneyaḥetc. cannot be complete until it lays down an action not laid down by any other sentence and so long as its own full signification is not complete, it cannot require the aid of another sentence. That is to say, that the Ashṭakapāla becomes is not a functioning by the human agent nor is it possible for a sentence to lay down only the functioning of a cake because such functioning would not have the character of any particular Bhavanā.

When there are various sacrifices, then the Sannayya and the Oshadhi come to be taken as both forming the materials to be offered in various sacrifices, and as such all the various materials having to be prepared for the Amāvāsyā sacrifice, it becomes quite relevant to speak of the prepara tion of one of these before the other, which would be entirely irrelevant in any other case. And further, in accordance with the Purvapaksha, over and above the three sacrifices, there would be a fourth in the shape of that enjoined by the sentence ya ēvametc. and as such the passage quoted in the Bhashya would refer to them as uttarani in the plural, and not as uttarē” in the Dual which refers to the two composite sacrifices, the Darça and the Paurṇamāsa.
tasmā samudāyānuvādāviti siddham /	Jel For these reasons we conclude that the sentences ya ēvametc. merely refer to the two previously mentioned composite sacrifices.
śraca ca /	Sūtra The case of the upançu would be like the Paurņamāsī.” The following three Adhikaranas treat of the exceptions to the general rule arrived at in the foregoing Adhikarana. Farising To the sentence upançuyajametc. apply all the conclusions arrived at in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa.
pādheiyasya prakṛte śabdaśaktitaḥ	ance of a sacrifice, explained below and it is with regard to this flaw of the jāmi that the first sentence mentions the upānçu sacrifice.
tatropāṃyājamantarā yajatīti tāvatsakandaḥ prāgukto nyāyo 'sti /	C The Purvapakshin replies to this objection by declaring that it is not necessary for us to take the word upänçuyāja as referring to the set of three sacrifices, as this reference can be made by the word yajati in the . same sentence and all that we mean is that the first sentence only refers to the three sacrifices.
teṣu tāvattavyapratyaye nai kāntiko vidhiḥ /	Because there being no other sacrifices mentioned in the context, the sentence cannot be taken as a mere reference and because no sacrifice is actually enjoined by the sentences vishnuḥetc. C.

As a matter of fact, it is not possible even for the Deity to be laid down by such sentences. Because the word yashṭavyaḥ in these does not signify either the Deity or that to which something is given because all that they actually signify is a material subordinate belonging to the sacrifice consequently what we have to do is to take the potency of the objective as the predominant element and as such what the word would signify would be what is signified by the Accusative caseending and certainly that does not establish the character of the Deity.
ciddhidhīyamānasyākātiṃ tadapanayanadvāreṇa stutyarthamiti gamyate /	Because the root yaji meaning to give away, its actual objective is that which is given away and hence the only possible explanation would be that the Deity approached by the object given away, comes subsequently to be indirectly connected with the Sacrifice.

Reply As a matter of fact, the root yaji does not directly signify the worshipping of a Deity because if that were the case, then Hymning also, which is a kind of worship, would come to be denoted by the root yaji but we shall show later on that when there is a Hymning of the Deity, that Deity cannot be said to be thereby worshipped, in the way that the guest is worshipped.
na hi devatāḥ stavānastatpū jāvyāpatopi sankaścidyaja iti ucyate /	That is to say, at the time that one is hymning a Deity, even if he be engaged in actual worship, it is not said sa yajate.
rūpā samavāyitvā ca nātithivaddevatā pūjyamānatāṃ pratipadyate /	And inasmuch as, in this case of Hymning, the actual form of the sacrificial Deity namely that of being one to whom an offering is made is not present in the Deity hymned, that Deity does not attain the character of an object of worship, like the Guest.
na ca yajistatpara iti navame vacyate	And further, that the root yaji does. not signify worship, we shall show later on, in Adhyāya IX.
tena yatra saṃpradānatvanirdeśaḥ tatraitaduktaṃ bhavati /	Then the character of one of these two is attributed to it, simply because, while being actually found to help in the accomplishment of the Actionand thereby having the character of the karaka Instrumentthere is no seventh case that could fit it exactly.

Thus then, in a case where we find an Injunction wherein the Deity is mentioned in the Dative Case, for instance, somāya yajatë, we must ex plain it as meaning that the offering should be made to that Deity, as if creating its right of ownership in the object offered when we meet with an Injunction in which the Deity is mentioned as the objective for instance, vishnuryashṭavyaḥ, its meaning is that it is the Deity refer ence to whom should be made for making the offering. It is for this reason that in a case where the only action of the Offerer lies in referring to or thinking of the Deity, and there is no actual offering made, we find the direction hotaryaja where all that the Hotri priest does is to think of the Deity to whom the offering has been made.
karmatvaṃ tu kriyāntareṣvapi vyāpyamānatvasaṃbhavātmavyabhicāra miti viprakataraṃ devatātvasya / na hi taddevatātvavatmakalaṃ yajiṃ prati karmetyavadhāryate /	Thus we find that both of these the Dative and the Objective character apply to the Deity only indirectly. And of these two again, we find that of the Objective, because it is the Dative alone that is an invariable con comitant of the action of giving, though its complete applicability has been found to be open to objection while as for the Objective, we find that it is present also in actions other than giving, and as such not being a necessary concomitant of the action of giving, it is not so closely related to the Deity.
paramārthataḥ punardevatāśabdena taniśabdena vā devatātvamabhidhīyate, na kāraka vibhaktyā kayā cit/	yaji is not fully applicable to the word Deity, just as the character of the Deity too is not found to be wholly applicable in the case in question. Because, as a rule, the Deity is always mentioned either by the use of the. word Deity itself, or by the use of a word with a nominal affix which signifies the Deity and never by means of any of the caseendings.
devatā taḍitotpāde na hi pāṇininā tathā /	C Thus then, it must be admitted that the sentence Vishnurupānçu yashṭavyaḥ does not serve the purpose of pointing out a Deity.

Even if the sentences vishnuḥ,etc. could be taken as injunctions of sacrifices, the particular sacrifice laid down by the sentence antarā,etc. must be an entirely distinct one and this sentence could not be taken as merely referring to these sacrifices.

S And in reply to this we urge that this objection applies equally to the opponent also because in the case of all words, what is desired first of all is the cognition of the relationship between the word and the meaning it denotes and it is only after this cognition that we come to ascertain that meaning to have the character of an Injunction or that of a mere Reference.

na tāvadviṣvādiyuktena vihitamarthavādatvāt/ nopāṃśu parṇamāsyāmityanena kānavidhivyāpatenā nekavidhyamakteḥ /	Nor could the word upānçuyāja be taken as the name of a sacrifice according to the sutra Iiv because upançutva has not been enjoined by any other text. For instance, it cannot be taken as enjoined by the sentences vishnuh,etc. because these have been shown to be mere Arthavadas nor by the sentence upançu paurnamāsyam because this sentence is wholly taken up by the laying down of the time paurṇamāsi, and it is not capable of further injunctions.
tasmāda tpattitsyenaiva vidhīyate / tathā ca sūtrakāro vakṣyati /	Therefore, we must admit it to be enjoined by the word upançu occurring in the original Injunction itself antara,etc. this will be pointed out in the next sūtra also.

The Bhashya represents another party declaring that these sacrifices to Vishnu &c.

yadyapyaprāptiriti cecāpi svayamevāśaṅkā darśitā / yadapyuktamu pāṃśudharmatvātprāptau tasmādyatkiṃ citprājāpatya miti tadadhyayuktam /	And as a matter of fact, that the opponent himself had doubts on the point of there being such a text is clearly shown by his own halfhearted declaration even if they be not laid down by such a text,etc. Then the opponent has declared in the Bhashya that the property of upançu having been laid down, some action is performed in honour of Prajapati, during the sacrifice.

Therefore the mere property of upançu cannot point to the fact of be longing to Prajapati.

And against this assertion, the following objections have been raised The sentence cited in the Bhashya cannot serve the purpose of laying down the Deity, because it is neither the Dative ending, nor the Deificnominal affix, nor the words of a mantra which three are the only means of mentioning the Deity. Be cause Agni and Soma made a certain declaration, what would that matter to the sacrificer, who would remain in the dark as I to that declara tion pointing to him the Deity to be sacrificed to? The sentence being a distinct injunction of the time Purnamāsī, it cannot serve the further injunctive purpose of laying down the Deity and if it be taken as the Injunction of the Deity, it would have to renounce its injunctive ness with regard to the time and then the sacrifice could not be referred to by the word Paurnamāsi and not being expressible by the word Paurnamasi and thereby having no connection with the sentence darçapūrṇamāsabhyām,etc. it would cease to be a primary, and become a subsidiary sacrifice.

In the order of the upānçuyāja, we find mentioned the mantras dedicated to Vishnu, Prajapati and Agnishoma, as also the pairs of Yajyas and Puronu vakyās and as all of them serve the purpose of pointing out the Deity.

In a fe fact, even in the Adhvaryava section we find the mention of the Yājyās and the Anuvakyas, in the shape of the Hautra and the mention of another Rescension may be with reference to this fact of the Hautra appearing in the Adhvaryava. And the mention of the qualification upançu too is for the purpose of showing this fact of the mantra belong ing to another Rescension viz that of the Yajush as it is the Yajush that is recited quietly. Otherwise if another Deity that of the Rk for instance were to be brought into the Upānçuyāja, then it would have to renounce its own characteristic of loudness belonging to the Rk and to take up the foreign characteristic of quietness belonging to the Yajush and this would entail a great incongruity.
anyā hi devatā 'trānīyamānā''tmīyaṃ dharmamuccaiṣva jahyāt paradharmamupāṃśutvaṃ prāpnuyāditi viruvam /	It would be very incongruous again if we assume another Deity in place of Agnishoma.

The declaration of the Bhashyatathagnishomayostu, etc.means that no injunction of the Deity being possible, the Deity is accepted according to circumstances and hence in the sentence laying down Purnamasi as the time, a reference to Agnishoma strengthens the introduc tion of the Deity without which the said Reference would be wholly in consistent.
prāye vacanāca	Sutra Because of the mention of the Property.

But this sentence is not the original injunction of the said property because the sentence not em bodying an injunction of a sacrifice, the said injunction of the property would involve the injunction of many things which is highly objection able.

Reply This does not touch our position because we do not find the sentence ‘tāvavrūtām,etc. enjoining any connection between the time Paurnamāsī and the deity Agnishoma and as for the Action itself, which is meant to be indicated by the time and deity, it is found to exist in other places also for instance, in the sacrifices to Vishnu, etc..
yadi hyagnīṣomayoreva paurṇamāmosaṃbandhaḥ kriyate tato vi ṣṇuprajāpatipañce na syāt /	That is to say, if the sentence were to lay down the connection of Paurnamäsi with the deity Agnishoma alone, then such connection would not be present in the case of Vishnu or Prajapati being the deity.

tasmādeka karmatvāyopāṃśuyājamantarā yajatītyayameva vidhiḥ tantravārtika /	Such double character would be possible only if there were many Upançusacrifices but this multiplicity of the Upānçu in view of the singleness of the Upançu sacrifice, we must admit, as an Injunction, only the sentence upānçuyājamantarā yajati and not the sentences vishnurupänçu yashṭavyaḥ, etc..

And further, in the case in question the various sentences cannot be taken together as forming a single sentence as in the previous Adhikarana nor does any of the two parties admit of the fact of the sentences being mere eulogistic ones and hence the Injunction would be an absolute one, of the Action, just as in the previous case you hold it to be that of the Accessory.

vidhitvaṃ prayayopāttaṃ na nāmapadammṛcchati/ taddidhirbhāvanātaśceścaiva pūrvaṃ vidhīyatām saṃjñopabandhāt	Because the Injunctiveness, being mentioned by the Affix, can never belong to the Noun. It may be urged that the Injunction of the Noun would follow from the Bhavanā but in that case, it would be the Bhāvunã that would be enjoined first. That is to say, the Injunctive character does not rest with the words dadhi and the rest and being expressed by the Affix, that character could not be related to the Curd, etc., except by means of the Bhāvanā and the Rootmeaning.

sāmānyaṃ svādidaṃ jñeyaṃ jñātatvānna kriyāntaram /	And the use of this reference lies in the unification of the Injunctions of the Means and the Result of these sacrifices. And thus dadhi and the other materials, each belonging to a distinct Action by itself, we are saved the undue necessity of taking them as optional alternatives.

As for the collective whole formed by the various actions, this can very well serve as the objective, because such a whole is actually brought about by the constituent actions. a That is to say, the presence of the Accusative in the words āghāram and ‘agnihotram would be possible only for a Noun that would be wanted by the Verb and certainly the actions of homa and aghara could never want to get at themselves because such selfactivity would be incompatible. As for the collective whole of Actions, how ever, inasmuch as it is mentioned apart from the constituent actions, by means of another word, it can very well be spoken of as something to be accomplished just as in the case of the sentence odanpākam pacati the particular kind of cooking is wanted by the generic cooking mentioned by the Verb and as such it is spoken of in the Accusative.
ityayuktameva karmatvaṃ, na avayava kriyāpracayasādhyatvātmamudāyasya /	Reply Not so because the whole is something that is actually brought about by a conglomeration of the constituent Actions.

na ca sāmānya viśeṣabhede nāpi bhavataḥ kriyātvakarmatve pākavatsaṃbhavataḥ sāmānya viśeṣa śabdayobhedanānupādānāt /	Reply This does not affect our position because even though the noun may directly denote the parts, it could be taken as indirectly in dicating the whole and as such, like its singleness, the accusative character also of the whole could very well be perceived. Nor is it possible, as in the case of the cooking, for the same action to be expressed by the Verb and also by the Accusative, through its twofold character of the general and the particular because in the case in question, we do not have the general and the particular actually mentioned.
etacca paurṇamāsīmityatrāpi sidvānte yojyaṃ, tasmāttaddadeva samudāyānuvādatvam	The above arguments could be applied, on behalf of the siddhanta, to the case of the sentence paurnamāsīm,etc. and hence also it follows that like the word paurnamāsī agnihotram also should be taken as a mere reference to the foregoing sacrifices.

Objection We have such sentences as tasyaghāramāghārya, etc., ida urdhvo, etc., aghāram, etc., which are found to point out the material and the mantric Deity and as such the mere mention of the name Āghāra would point out its accessory details.
na cedanyena śiṣṭā iti vāpavādānna viśiṣṭa vidhānanyāyaḥ saṃbhavati /	Reply Not so because the word aghara, apart from the denota tion of its verbal Root, cannot serve the purposes of a specification. A name expresses a peculiarity only in that case where the name has been applied with a distinct reference to a certain peculiarity.
taddarśayatyasminhi sati vidhāne pratyakṣaṃ na saṃbandhaḥ śaknotyarthādānepnumityarthaḥ/	In reply to this, we have the present sutra, which means that the aghara is not the prakrta because it occurs in a context dealing with the Darçapaurnamāsa and certainly the Prakarana of one Action can have no application in the case of another.
atha vā asminhi sati saṃbandhividhāvitareṇa guṇavidhānena saṃbandha etra kevala āśrīyate /	In reply to this also we have this same sutra, the sense being that what you say is not possible, because it is only the superior authority of Syntactical Connection that can establish a relationship with something not occurring in the same context.
tasmānnaita dvākyanirapekṣaiḥ saṃbandhavidhibhiraryādaparau kalpayituṃ homāghārau śakate ya innenānayoranuvādatvaṃ syāt /	And thus there is an agreement be tween Syntactical Connection and Context, when the originative sentences themselves are admitted to have within themselves the mention of the U material and the Deity.
bhāvanādhātvarthāvujhinvā na vi dhidhyādibhiḥ saṃbadhyataiti cetsatyameta,nna vidhitvaṃ bhāvanāta uttāryate tadgatenaiva tu guṇaḥ saṃspṛṇyate, guṇasya kāraka vibhaktyā bhāvanāmadhyanikṣepāt/	It is only when even a slight detail of the Action is mentioned, that the character of the Action being thereby duly ascertained, other details come to be connected with it, in some way or another. Sutra They are injunctions of independent Actions because the words distinctly express something to be performed and the repetition of the same words is for the purpose of laying down the accessory details. The Bhashya speaks of the sentences being the Injunctions of other actions though what is meant is that they are Injunctions of Actions hence this assertion of the Bhashya should be taken as shown above on p. of the text, Translation, p.

Nor can it be urged that the actions of Aghara and Homa are already enjoined by the sentences urdhvam,etc. and dadhna,etc. because the Injunctive potency of these sentences is taken up by the laying down of the accessories in the shape of urdhva and dadhi, which are not laid down by any other sentence and as such we cannot very well discard the idea of these sentences merely referring by the words agharayati and juhoti to the actions of Aghara and Homa enjoined by the two former sentences. Nor is the law of Qualified Injunction sutra Iiv applicable to these sentences, because of the saving clause if they are not enjoined by another sentence. It is this that is meant to be shown by the Bhashya In the case of the sentences ürdhvam,etc. the injunction of the action of the Aghara and Homa could not be indirectly indicated by the expressed relationship of the dadhi and ürdhva because so long as we have direct injunctions of these actions in the sentences agharam,etc. and agnihotram, etc., they.
vidhānaṃ, ṣaṣṭhastu dhātvarthenānyayoḥ saṃbandhaḥ, saptamaḥ punarvātvarthaviśiṣṭena pratyayenānyayoḥ saṃbandhaḥ, aṣṭamasta mukkā dhātvarthamanyayoreva saṃbandha, iti /	cannot be taken as indirectly indicated,etc. And the sense of this is that so long as we have direct Injunctions, we cannot have them as indirectly indicated by any relationships or that so long as we have an Injunction of a member of relationship, the other sentences may be taken as laying down accessories, and as such we cannot accept mere relationship.
tatra tāvadyaducyate agnihotraṃ juhotītyetadvātvarthavidhānamiti tadayuktam /	Consequently it is not possible for the actions of Aghara and Homa to be indicated by the injunctions of relationships, independently of the two sentences agharam,etc. and agnihotram,etc. and as such on the mere strength of any such indication, these latter sentences cannot be taken as mere references to previously enjoined actions.
na hi vidhirbhāvanāmutsṛjya dhātvarthe nipatati, na ca bhāvanāṃ mukkā 'nyatra puruṣaḥ pravarttate /	It may be argued thatno Injunction could ever give up the Bhāvanā and the Rootmeaning, and betake itself to the Dadhi as held by you. This is quite true but we do not dissociate the Injunction. from the Bhāvanā altogether what we mean is that the accessorydadhi is touched by the Injunction as pertaining to the Bhāvanā specially as the caseending indadhna serves to throw that accessory into the Bhāvanā.

And it has been already explained under sutra IIi that the Root meaning is never enjoined as something to be accomplished but only as an Instrument and when it is not an Instrument but something to be accomplished, it does not stand in need of another object to be accom plished and as such it could not be enjoined, by any other sentence, with reference to any definite Result.
tathā śrī donproścatītyatra na prokṣaṇena brīcīniti kaścimaṃbandhastenobhayoḥ karotyarthasaṃbandhāna dhātvartho vrīhiṣu vidhoyate /	As an example of they quote vrihin prokshati but in this case we are cognisant of no such relationship, as prokshanēna vrihin be cause both are kärakas and as such cannot be related and hence both of these being related to the sense of karoti the sense of the sentences being prokshaneña vrihin kuryat, it is not the meaning of the Root proksha that is enjoined with reference to the vrihi.

pakṣadvayoktamapi nirākaraṇaṃdaśāpavitreṇa grahaṃ saṃmāṣṭotyatrāpyāpadyate ityayuktamanyatra vi śiṣṭadhātvarthavidhānam/	M As an instance of they cite daçapavitreṇa graham sammārshṭi but the arguments urged against the last two apply to this also and hence it is not right to accept the Injunction of the qualified Rootmeaning with reference to something else.
śabdādastuto vā sivaṃ, na ca dadhnaḥ karttavyatā nityaṃ karaṇātmakatvāt /	as a place nor is so, in the actual state of things nor is the dadhi some thing to be done, because it has always the character of the Instrument.

kāmaṃ vā śuddhadhātvarthavidhānāt tasya vā 'nyatra vidheranantarā karttavyā/	In fact it should have been mentioned either immediately after the Injunc tion of the pure Rootmeaning, or after that of the Rootmeaning with regard to something else.
yattu prākāśāvadhvaryave dadātītyanena dadātidhātvarthe prākāśādhvaryusaṃbandho vidhīyataiti tadayuktam /	As an instance of , they quote prakāçau adhvaryavě dadati, where, it is held, the relationship of the Präkaça with the Adhvaryu is enjoined with reference to the meaning of the verb dadāti.
vacanavyaktya vivekātmarvatra hi ya cchabdenānūdyamānamupanivadhya tacchabdayaktaṃ vidheyamupanīyate/	But this is scarcely correct because such an interpretation bespeaks a sad want of a due un derstanding of the syntax of the sentence as in all sentences that which is introduced by the word yat is the subject, and that which is mentioned by the word tat is the Predicate.

saṃbandho hi vidhīyamānaḥ saṃbandhinaṃ tāvadākṣipe,dvātvarthe tu punaḥ sa vidhānavya eva saṃbandhī anyathā saṃbandhasyaiva saṃbandhī śeṣaḥ syāt na kriyāyāḥ /	Whenever a relation is enjoined, it always implies the members related in the case of the injunction of the Rootmeaning, how ever, there is no relative member to be laid down for otherwise the Relative would be subordinate to the Relationship, and not to the Action. Here it may be argued that the affix accompanied by the Root meaning, while laying down the Relationship, wonld lay it down with refer ence to the Rootmeaning. If this be meant, then the next two and methods of Injunction would be included in this and it would be useless to speak of them separately.
evaṃ tardhuttarayorapi śrutyoracaivāntarbhāvādbhedenopādānaṃ vyarthaṃ, na hi vāyavyaṃ śvetamālabheta ḍhaghnendriyakāmasya juhuyāditi dhātvarthānanuraktaḥ pratyayaḥ saṃbandhaṃ vidadhātīti / prakṛtiliṅgamātraphala śvānnabhati ruccāryamāṇo na dravyadevatāsaṃvandhividhāvātmānurañjanena kiṃ cir̤hapakaroti /	vayavyam çveta malabheta cited as an instance of or in dadhnēndriyakāmasya juhuyāt cited as an instance of , the Affix accompanied by the Rootmeaning does not lay down the Relationship as a matter of fact, the root alabha, being uttered only as a mark of the Primary Sacrifice in question, do not in any way help, by its colouring, in the injunction of the Relationship between the material gveta and the Deity Vayu nor can this rela tionship be accomplished by means of the root alabha because the Deity and the Material appertain to the sacrifice and not to the alambhana, touching killing. If, in the accomplishment of the relationship, the Root did anything besides the bringing about of the utterance of the affix, then, in the case of the injunction of the Relationship between the Dadhi and the senseorgans, why should the Homa have been left out? Or again, why should the Homa be taken only as pointed out by the context? Therefore we conclude that there can be no injunction of the relationship of something else, with reference to the Rootmeaning.
na cā'sau saṃvandha ājabhatinā saṃpādayituṃ śakyo yāgaviṣayatvād dravyadevatayoḥ /	And it has already been explained that prior to the connection of the Bhavana, there is no injunction of even the Relationship, with reference to the Rootmeaning. Thus then, we cannot take the sentence as laying down the Relationship with reference to all givings. If the giving be taken as qualified by the Adhvaryu, or the Adhvaryu be taken as qualified by the giving, even then, as these would be a qualified reference, there would be a syntac tical split.

Question How could the Bhavanā be enjoined when it is already laid down by another sentence ? Answer The Bhāvanā qualified as it is in the sentence in question has never been laid down before and hence it would be in the qualified form that the Bhavana would be enjoined and what it really comes to is that the Injunction is for the sake of the qualification, as we shall explain later on.
tasmānna dhāsvarthe'nyasaṃvandhavidhiḥ / pūrvavacca dhātvarthādhikaraṇatā kārakakarttavyatā ca nirākarttavyā /	Objection In that case, the injunctive word not functioning over the qualifications, if it were to lay them down through the Bhāvanā, then, even in the case of the injunction of an action that has already been laid down, it could lay down many qualifications, in the same manner as it does in the case of an action never laid down before and as such a case would not be amenable to the law that when an action has been enjoined, what ever is mentioned is for its sake, and hence particular qualifications would be mentioned for particular actions.
na ca dhātvarthe saṃbandhasyāpi prāgbhāvanāsaṃgatervidhirityuktam /	That is to say, in a case where the In junctiveness pertaining to the Bhāvanā is taken as being for the sake of the Bhavana itself, the injunction of the qualification comes to be implied by it and in this case we do not perceive any syntactical split.
evaṃ tāvanna dānamātre saṃvandhavidhiḥ /	And thus we do not find any incongruity in this.
athādhvaryu viśiṣṭaṃ dānamanūdyatām adhvaryurvā tadviśiṣṭaḥ evamapi śiṣṭānuvādā dvākyabhedaḥ/	The author proceeds to make his point clear by addingeven though the qualification would be inoperative, the meaning of the word would be duly ascertained. This latter sentence of the Bhashya may also be taken as emanating from the objector, who is cogitating over.
śudvādhvarśvanuvāde tu yadyapi saṃpradānaśruterarthāhānamā cipyate tathāpi saṃpradāna saṃpradeya saṃbandhasya dadātimantareṇānupapadyamānatvād dravyadevatā saṃbandhādiva yajeḥ kapana miti na dhātvarthe 'nyasaṃbandha iti vacanavyaktiḥ saṃbhavati/	The sense of this is that, because of its proximityi.e., because of the fact of the qualification having entered into the Bhavana, it becomes an object of Injunction or that because of the proximity of Qualification, there is a transference of the Injunctive Potency or that because of the proximity of the Injunction by another sentence of the Bhavana and the Root meaning of juhoti , the Injunction in the sentence in question is that of the Qualification, specially as there is no incompatibility between Direct Assertion and Syntax. Says the BhashyaThe utterance of juhoti? in the sentences dadhna juhoti,etc. is with a view to referring to the previously enjoined Homa, for the purpose of connecting it with the materials dadhi, etc.. Though the mention of the word juhoti was quite clear, yet the Author has explained it only with a view to show that by that he refers to all verbs under similar circumstances for instance, agharayati and the rest. Question If the word juhoti only serves to refer to the Homa, by what word is the qualifying material enjoined? Answer You should not run away with the idea that I declare it to be enjoined by the word dadhi.
vayaṃ cātrādānādhvarkhe codakena prāptatvātprākāśāveva vidhātavyaiau	Thus then we conclude that the sentences agnihotram juhoti and agharamagharayati are the injunctions of Actions. This should be ex plained in the same way as we have pointed out above text, p. , trans lation, p. with regard to the upānçu. .
vidhitve bhāvanāsthe 'pi tādathyaṃ pravibhajyate /	As a matter of fact, in similar cases, we do admit of reference to previously enjoined actions.
viśeṣaṇaphane cāsminvākyabhedo bhaviṣyati	Otherwise the single performance of the procedure in the morning would have sufficed for the evening offering also, in accordance with the law laid down under Xiii.
samadāyānuvādasya na tāvat dṛśyate phalam/	Nor is there any useful Hence purpose served by making the two Agnihotras one and the same.
prayogavacanaikatvaṃ lapsyate rājasvayavat	And just as in the case of a Rajasuya, all necessary reference is accomplished by the single sentence rājasūyēna svārājyakāmo yajēta, and no other sentence is wanted for the reference, so would it also be in the case of the Agnihotra.
agnibhyo'pūrvasiddhiḥ syādādhāratvopalaścitā / caikenāvarudvatvādādhārāntarasaṃbhavaḥ	from having to take the various Fires as optional alternatives. no room for any Otherwise, if the transcendental result were the only ground, the particular Apurva, or transcendental result, would follow from the Fires only when these would be made the receptacles of the offerings and as the place of the receptacle would be occupied by one Fire, there could be That is to say, though the presence of the Fire other.
yattu sāyaṃprātavāṃkyayora nekārthatvātkarmavidhitvamiti /	It has been urged above that the sentence yadagnayē, etc., and yatsuryaya, etc., serving many purposes, form independent injunctions. of Actions.
sāyaṃ juhoti prātarjuhotīti vākyāntaraprāptaḥ kālo devatāvyavasthāpare vākye saṃkorcyate /	In reply to this we urge that the times morning and evening of the Libations having been already enjoined by the sentences sayam juhoti and pratarjuhoti, all that the sentences in question do is to refer to the same times with the sole view of pointing out the Deities to whom the several Libations are to be offered.
na, prakaraṇalabdha karmaṇi kālamātre devatāvi dhānāt / sa tu kālo na svarūpeṇa devatayā saṃvadhyataiti prakaraṇa nabhyakarmānuraktaḥ saṃbadhyate /	Reply Not so because the Action Libation being pointed out by the Context, what the sentences do is to lay down the Deities with reference to the time only and as the time cannot by itself be related to the Deities, we connect the Deities with the time as affected by the Action pointed out by the Context and hence there is no actual reference to the Action qualified by the Time, that would bring about the split.
atha vā vidhīyamānasaṃpradānabhūtadevatākāṅkṣitaprakṛtahomaparyupasthāpane na kālasyopa yogaḥ / na ca lakṣaṇayā ubhyamāno homo vākyaṃ bhinatti / na ca sāyaṃkālenānyatra sthito lakṣitaḥ tena sāyaṃhomasyāgniprajāpatī bhaviṣyataḥ /	Or, the mention of the time in the sentences yadagnaye,etc. may be taken as serving the purpose of indirectly recalling the original Homa, which is wanted by the peculiar character of the receiver of a gift in which the Deities enjoined are represented in the sentences where the words express ing them have the Dative ending, as without an offering of the Homa, this character of the Deities would not be possible and certainly when the Homa is only indirectly indicated, it cannot lead to any split in the sentence nor does the time evening indicate a performance at any other time hence we conclude the sentences to mean only that of the evening Libation Agni and Prajapati, and of the morning one Sürya and Prajapati, would be the deities, and they do not lay down independent Actions.
namvevamapi bhinnapadopātte dve dve devate vidadhatī vākye bhidyeyādvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	Objection Thus too, inasmuch as each of these sentences would lay down two deities, there would certainly be a syntactical split in them because that would necessitate a double functioning of the same injunctive sentence.
na, ekakārakatvāditi ke cit / kārakānyatve hi vidhervyāpārabhedo bhavati ekakārakanibandhanaṃ tvarthasahasramadhyekaprayatna sādhyamityuktam /	Reply Not so Some people offer the following explanation Because the words expressing the two Deities have the same caseending it is only when there is a diversity of caseendings that there is a difference in the functioning of the Injunctive sentence so long as the caseending remains the same, even if there be a thousand objects to be laid down, they are all amenable to a single syntactical operation. But against this explanation, we urge the following When a single caseending happens to be connected with many words, it cannot be enjoined except by the Injunctive Affix being repeated over and over again and this would entail different Injunctive operations.
atrābhidhīyate	As a rule, the caseending employs.
vibhaktyā hi kārakaṃ pratyāyyate /	the Affix Injunctive for the purpose of taking up the object denoted by the noun and hence when the caseending is pronounced more than once, it cannot but employ the Affix more than once and thus there is a repetition of the Affix which brings about the syntactical split urged by the opponent.
sā ca yatraikāgnīṣomādau tatra sakṛdeva pratyayasya vyāpāro bhavati /	And the Deities having been laid down by these mantras, they are mentioned again in the sentences in question, which lay down Prajāpati as the Deity, only by way of an eulogy i.e., an offering to Agni and Sūrya is as good as that to Prajapatil.
yatra punaḥ bhinna vibha 'ktasaṃbaddhānekapadopāttamekamapi kārakaṃ bhavati yathā 'caivāyeca prajāpataye ceti, tatra yugapatpratyaveśaṇābhāvāda vaśyaṃ bhedenāgniprajāpato pratyayenānocāyatavyaiau /	Though the Bhashya has cited these sentences under sutra Iiv, as laying down the, four Deities of the Agnihotra, yet the quotation must be taken only as showing that the sentences also serve to recall the Deities pointed out by the mantras because it is thus alone that we are saved from a needless repetition of the Injunctions contained in the mantras. Otherwise in the meeting of the arguments brought forward under sutra Iii, we would have to undergo the trouble of taking the sentence yadagnaye,etc. either as the Injunction of an accessory detail, or as a Parisankhyā, or as an Arthavada.
tasmānnaiṣa parihāra ityevamabhidhīyate /	For these reasons, we conclude that in the case in question there is no syntactical split.
agnisūryayoḥ punamaintravarṇādeva prāptiḥ vākyāntaraṇetyevaṃdevatyā ma ntrī vihita	Reply It is not so because the Agnihotra has been laid down as to be performed throughout ones life and when one has offered the evening libation, if he lives till the morning, it behoves him to offer themorning libation also, because all the conditions present in the preceding evening, present themselves again.
kāmyaḥ sarvāṅgasaṃyuktaḥ prayogaśca phacārthinā / sāyaṃprātarvikalpena prayoktavyastadā bhavet	And further, an action that is done with a definite result in view, must be performed, by one desiring that result, as fully equipped with all its accessories and on this score too, it would be a matter of option whether the Action is performed in the morning or in the evening. In accordance with the theory that the same action is repeated at the two times, it becomes necessary for the performer to complete all the accessories, at both times.
dravyasaṃyogācodanā paśusomayoḥ pra karaṇe hyanarthako dravya saṃyogo na hitasya guṇārthena paśorduṣpratipādanataratvātpūrvābhidhānam / hau vātra śabdā sahāyānuvādatvenāśayate paśuśabdastadagnīṣomasaṃbandhānumitaśca yajiḥ /	In any case, how can we escape from the fact of the two libations being optional alternatives? Reply We do not take them as alternatives because of the fact of the two libations being distinctly mentioned in the Veda as together constituting a single Action for instance, having begun with pravargyo va eshah the Veda goes on to say sa vai sāyam ca prātaçca juhoti,etc. Even when the two Libations are taken as distinct Actions, the fact of their being taken together would be based upon the word ca in the sentence. Nor would such conjunction of the two necessitate their performance in close proximity with each other because the text quoted does not lay down a conjunction of the times of their performance and hence there is no incongruity in the matter. That is to say, the times being laid down in the sentences, all that the text quoted does is to point out the fact of the two Actions together going to form a single Action and hence there is no syntactical split.
yathāgneyādivākyānāṃ na prāgyāgānumānataḥ / svārthaparyavasāyitvaṃ tathā some 'pi gamyatām api ca taveha caindravāyavā divākyeṣu ca / matpane tu teṣveva kevaleṣviti viśeṣaḥ /	It has been urged above that these two libations being subsidiaries to the Agnihotra, they could not be performed separately by them selves. But this does not affect our case because when the Action is laid down with reference to a time, then alone does it require a full connection with all its subsidiaries hence when the Evening Libation appears as the Primary Sacrifice, then the subsidiaries that aid in its performance are those that are possible at that time, and none else because of the nonaffinity of these to the Evening Libation similarly also with the Morning Libation and hence there is a repetition of the subsidiaries as it happens that the same subsidiaries are possible at both times.
ekacaiveśe guṇe śrayamāṇe vidhiśaktiḥ saṃkrāmatītyagnihotre 'bhihitam/ ato na karmānuvādabuddhirapaitītyanuvādatvaṃ yajeḥ /	It has been urged that there is no useful purpose served by the theory of the present Siddhanta.” In reply to this we point out that in connection with the Kunda payināmayana, we find the sentence masamagnihotram juhoti and as this sentence apparently lays down a single Action, we naturally look out for only one method of procedure and hence what we would take up are the accessories either of the Evening Libation alone or of the Morning Liba tion alone and as such we would perform but once every day during the month, the Action with a single set of accessories this would be the case if the evening Libation were an action totally different from the morning one.
tatra somaśabdena dravyameva gṛhṇātinā sāmānyākṣiptaṃ niyamyate /	Sutra Because of the connection with certain materials the words ‘paçu,etc. and soma,etc. contain injunctions as in the context the mention of the mere material would be uselessspecially because the words do not serve the purpose of laying down accessory materials.

Further, the kind of Action that you will seek to have enjoined by the sentence somena yajeta can never form the object of an Injunc tion, as we have shown above, in connection with the Agnihotra, where it has been pointed out that the injunctive potency pertains directly to the directlymentioned material soma and as such the sentence could “not serve the purpose of enjoining the sacrifice and as such we cannot but admit the yaji in yajēta to be a mere reference to certain pre viously mentioned sacrifices what, then, the sentence does, in connection with the said sacrifices, is to specify the material soma, which had been .

Reply What harm is there if we have another name? Very often The useful purpose served by such reference to a number of sacrifices, as we hold, is that it is only when all these sacrifices are referred to collectively as one, that they could be spoken of in the singular num ber, in the final sentence that sums up their performability viz., the sentence jyotishṭomena svargakāmo yajēta.
tasmādanuvādaiti /	Hence we conclude that the sentence in question is a mere reference to previous sacrifices.

Reply Just as in the case of the mention of paçu animal in general, the mantra leads us to believe that the goat is meant,so, in the same manner, the mention of the limbs hrdaya, etc., points to that animal itself, as the source or material cause of those limbs.
hṛdayādibhiḥ prakṛtidravye 'peścite mantravarṇācchāge labdhe ta dantargataṃ paśutvaṃ tābadanūdyate /	That is to say, the hrdaya, etc., stand in need of a source from which they would come forth and the mantra having pointed to the goat, it is the paçutva of this goat that is referred to by the word pagu in the sentence paçumalabheta and the Deity of the actions mentioned in these sentences hrdasyagrevadyati,etc. being laid down by the sentence agnishomiyam paçumalabhēta, there would be nothing i the way of those sentences laying down the sacrifice.
tatra tu devatāyāṃ vihitāyāṃ yāgo vidhīyatāṃ nāma /	with each of the limbs hrdaya, grīvā,etc. mentioned, that are referred to by the word alabhēta.

somayāgaikatve tamtyārthānāmindravāravādīnāṃ vikalpe sati kramasamuccayadarśanaṃ nopapadyate /	Further, if there were, as you hold, a single Somasacrifice for which the sentences aindravayavam,etc. would lay down accessory details, then, inasmuch as Indra, Vayu, and the rest would all serve the same purpose of the Deity at that sacrifice, they would become optional alternatives and as such they should not have been mentioned in a definite order, one after the other nor should they have been subsequently mentioned collectively.

In our theory, on the other hand, each of the Deities belonging to a distinct sacrifice, and all the Deities and sacrifices serving to bring about transcendental results, it is only natural that all of them should be laid down by a single word jyotishtoma with regard to the Result attainment of Heaven and as such there is nothing incongruous in their being mentioned collectively, or in a definite order of sequence.
ekathāgatve'pi samastapaśu sādhanatvena tadupapatteḥ /	And as all the sacri fices are laid down collectively with reference to the result, they have all to be performed, and they cannot be taken as optional alterna tives.

To the above we make the following reply It is only when the sacrifice mentioned in a sentence is actually recog nised to be the same as those mentioned before, that we take it to be a mere reference to these in the cases in question, however, we do not find this to be the case.
ta smātmamudāyānuvādau iti prāpte 'bhidhīyate yadi paiaurṇamāsīvadaśeṣarūpapratyabhijñānaṃ bhavettato'nuvādaḥ kalpyeta /	That is to say, if in the case in question we recognised the sacrifice to be exactly the same in all its details as those mentioned before, as we do in the case of the Paurnamāsa sacrifice, then we could take the sentence as a mere e reference. If again, the sentence were held to be a reference to the root yaji alone, then we could conclude it to be a reference bereft of the qualifications.
yadi vā yajimācasyānuvādatvamiṣyate tataḥ pa rityaktaviśeṣaṇo'nuvāda ityavadhāryeta / atra punaḥ prakṛtā hahaiḍhayādidravyakā ramadravyakāśca yāgāḥ /	It might here be argued that inasmuch as the modifications are generally spoken of as the original substance, we could take the words paçu and soma as indirectly referring to their respective modifications, the limbshrdaya,etc. and the juice, W But this cannot be because without sufficient reason we cannot have recourse to such indirect indication. It is only when we find a word spoken of as coextensive or synonymous with another word that has an al together different signification, as in the sentence agnirmanavakaḥ , or when the direct meaning of the word is found to be incompatible with the rest of the sentence, that we can have recourse to the secondary indirect significations of words.

tanna / vinā kāraṇena lakṣaṇānāśrayaṇāt / vispaṣṭe hi paraśabdasāmānādhikaraṇye satyananyathāsaṃbhave ca jaghanyavṛttiḥ śabdo bhavati /	And thus, even on the ground of the difference in materials, thereVi G would be a difference between the sacrifices laid down by the former sentences, and that enjoined by the sentence in question. These arguments, however, can be successfully met by the opponent who will argue as follows In the case of the ashṭakapala cake, etc., though we find that these cakes are directly laid down as the materials, yet we accept the Corn Vrihi as the material, though this is pointed out only by Syntactical Connec tion and in the same manner we could accept the Soma as the enjoined material.
na caitadubhayamapyasti /	It is only when there is a contradiction between two things that the stronger sets aside the weaker and this is not the case when the two things are quite compatible with one another.
śakyaṃ hi mukhyapaśusomadravyaṃ yāgāntaraṃ vidhātum /	question we find that the Soma is quite compatible with the juice, because this latter stands in need of something from which it could be extracted, and the Somaplant comes in as fulfilling this requirement.
teṣvaniviśamānāvetau śabdau nopapadyate / tena yadyapi tāvadavadyatigṛhṇātibhyāṃ coditā yāgāḥ tathāpi karmāntaratvapramaṅgaḥ / kasmātteṣveva yāgeṣu khadravyaprakṛtyapekṣeṣu paśusomau na vidhoyete/	For instance, in the case of the sentence agneyoshṭāka pālaḥ, etc., though In the case in we find that the ashṭakapāla is directly laid down by the sentence, yet when the Vrihi and the Yava come to be laid down as the materials, there is no contradiction for these corns are actually required as the material out of which the ashṭakapala cake would be made and certainly, in taking up the Vrihi one does not give up the making of the Ashtäkapala and hence in this case the action with reference to which Vrihi is laid down as the material is not recognised as any other than that for which the ‘ Ashta kapāla has been laid down.
paśustāvaddevatāvidhiparatvādanutpattivākye satyaśakya eva vidhātumiti naivopanyasyate / somalatāpi vākyavidheyā śrautarasavirodhe sati na saṃbadhyate /	Exactly in the same manner, in the case in question, in taking up the Somaplant, one does not give up the juice i and hence there being no incompatibility between the two, inasmuch as the Soma mentioned in the sentence in question can very well be taken as the material for the sacrifices laid down by the other sentences, the sentence in question cannot be taken as laying down a distinct Action, merely on the ground of a difference in the materials mentioned. And further, the argument applies equally to the Siddhanta also becsuse the Siddhanta also does not hold that the unpounded Somaplant is to be offered at the sacrifice and hence just as for you the Plant would only be the source of the Juice, so also would it be for the Purvapakshin.
tataśca vākprāptā taiva bacīyaso syāt /	As a matter of fact, it is your own theory that would be the more incongruous of the two.

tataśca guṇādapi te bhedaḥ prāpnoti /	original Plant itself is quite capable of being offered bodily by itself, it does not stand in need of any mention of its modifications and as such any connection of these would be wholly incompatible consequently, we could not accept any such connection as laid down by other sentences.
śakyaparihāraṃ tvidam yathaivāṣṭakapadī śrautepi sati vākyataḥ /	In view of these arguments, based as they are on the firm ground of such examples as the aforesaid injunction of Vrihi, etc., which completely shut our mouth, it is best for us not to start the question of the Injunction of Materials, and to confine ourselves solely to the refutation of the view of the sentences in question being mere references to previously mentioned sacrifices.
vrīhyādayo vidhīyante tathā somo vidhāsyate	But in the case of Soma, it becomes necessary for us to refute the opponents arguments based upon the Injunction of the Vrihi and for this purpose we have the next sutra.
tadyathāgneyo 'ṣṭā kapāla iti śrutivihitepyaṣṭākapāle mati vrīhiyavau vidhīyamānau na virudhyete /	The sentences hrdaya sya,etc. or aindravayavam,etc. do not serve the purpose of laying down accessory details, like the sentences dadhna juhoti and the rest in fact these themselves are original In junctions.
puroḍāgāpeścitaprakṛtirūpatvāt /	Why? Because of the mention of materials, i.e., because of the mention of such materials as hrdaya, etc., these sentences are the Injunctions of the Paçu and the Soma.
tayātra na some gṛhyamāṇe rasaḥ parityakta ityāvirodhātpūrvacaiva saṃbhavanna guṇo bhedakaḥ syāt	As otherwise, through the Con text, the connection of Hrdaya, etc., would become subsidiary to the sacrifice while as a matter of fact, it is not possible for this connection to serve as its accessory because that would be contrary to the paçu and the somaplant laid down in the original Injunctive sentences.
kathaṃ punardravyasaṃyogādityanena pūrvapano'bhidhīyate /	Or, in accordance with a previous law, the Paçu and the Soma having been obtained from other sentences, the mention of the con nection of materials, in the present context, would, in your theory, be wholly useless.
hṛda yasyāgre 'vadyati aindravāyavaṃ gṛhṇātītyetāḥ kiṃ dadhyādiva gu pārthāḥ śrutayaḥ / tataścottarayorutpatticodanārthatvam /	In my theory, on the other hand, the word Soma in somēna yajeta is the name of the sacrifice, and the sentence agnishomiyam paçum,etc. serves the purpose of laying down the Deity AgniSoma and thus none of these two sentences making mention of any material, the mention of materials in the other sentences is not at all superfluous.
utaitā eva karmacodanā iti/	Prio Sūtra But as laying down purificatory rites they cannot be injunctive of independent Actions.
kiṃ prāptaṃ naitāḥ pūrvavat guṇārthāḥ punaḥ śrutayaḥ dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda /	The sentences in question cannot be taken as mere references to pre vious sacrifices, because of these latter not being the sacrifices treated of hy the context, an argument that has already been explained on a previous occasion, in sutra IIii.

Answer Because the words avadyati and grḥnāti are not in junctive of sacrifices as what they do is only to lay down certain purifi catory or preparatory rites because they are actually found to end with them as when a sentence is actually found to have its sole ending in the pointing out of such rites, there is no ground for assuming a sacrifice to be indirectly indicated. P Because such a sacrifice, if it could be assumed, could only be assumed in the following manner when a substance is taken up with reference to a certain deity, unless it is connected with some sacrifice, it does not become dedicated to that Deity.
atha vā pūrvektena nyāyenānyata eva paśusomayoḥ siddhatvādasminprakaraṇe punaranarthako dravyasaṃyogaḥ tvatpakṣe bhavet/ mama tu somaśabdo nāmadheyamagnīṣomīyavākyaṃ ca devatāvidhānārthamiti na kiṃ cidanarthakam/	In the case in question, however, the sentence aindravāyavam grḥnāti serves to direct the human agent to take up the vessel containing the juice, etc., and thus, even without the indication of a sacrifice, it has got a distinct object for its injunctiveness, and as such is quite complete in itself and that the sentence stands in need of something else is quite another matter having nothing to do with the completeness of the sentence because in all cases, even when the sentence is complete in itself, it does not, by that fact, give up all its need for other factors nor does the fact of its being in such need make the sentence incomplete and as we recognise the fact that this need is supplied by another sentence, there can be nothing incongruous in the fact of a complete sentence bing related to another sentence.
yaduktam āgneyādivannāparikalpite yajau vākyāntarapekṣeti tatra brūmaḥ	Consequently when we proceed to assume a sacrifice in connec tion with each of the sentences aindravayavam grḥnāti, etc., the sacrifice mentioned by the sentence somena yajeta at once presents PA itself and thus puts a stop to the said assumption and there is nothing incongruous in this.
āgneyo'ṣṭākapālo bhavatīti na yāgādanyaḥ puṃvyāpāraḥ pratīyataiti prāktadanumānādaparipūrṇa vākyam /	In the case of the sentence agneyo.

dravyeṇātyantabhinnena saha cintyaṃ balābalam / hṛdayādirasadāramaṅgatvaṃ paśusomayoḥ	S The following is the reply to this objection It is only when the two substances concerned are wholly different from one another, that there can be any comparison between their respective authoritative character in the case in question, however, through the juice and the various limbs also, it is only the soma and the animal that form part of the sacrifices concerned.
paśusomo hi yāgasādhanatvena codyamānāviti karttavyatāmākāṅkṣataḥ / tatra ca rasahṛdayādinighpattidvāreṇetyevaṃ kathaṃbhāvaḥ pūryate tenānugrāhakatvānna tatkalpane dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda /	If the sentences wholly renounced the Soma and the Animal laid down in the originative injunction, and laid down other substances wholly different from them, then alone could there be a contradiction between the substances enjoined by the two sentences as it is, however what the subsequent sentences lay down is that, the sacrifice is accomplished by means of the Animal itself, through its various limbs, as also by means of the Soma, through its juice and certainly there can be no contradiction in the presence of different methods of procedure. For the Animal and the Soma, being laid down as the means of performing the sacrifices, stand in need of the method of that performance and it is this method that is supplied by the mention of the fact that the animal has to be cut up into its several limbs and then offered in sacrifice, and the Soma has to be pounded into juice before it is offered and thus the mention of the hrdaya, etc., and the juice only serves to help the original mention of the substance, and there is no chance of contradiction.
yattu prākaraṇikaiḥ krayādivākyaireva prāptatvādica dravyasaṃyogo 'narthaka iti tatrāpyacodakāca saṃskārā ityevottaram / na hi te viṣayaḥ somasya paśorvā codakā, kiṃ tarhi tayoreva saṃskārakāḥ/	Another objection is that the Soma having been mentioned, as the substance to be offered, by other sentences in the same context, such as somam krīṇāti, etc., the further mention of the same substance soma by the sentence somēna yajeta is wholly superfluous. In reply to this, we have the Sutra itself the sense being that those sentences Somam krināti, etc., do not serve the purpose of enjoining either the Soma or the Animal as all that they do is to speak of the method of preparing these.
tena coditamya dravyasya yathā kathaṃ cidupādānena yāgasādhanatve prasakta krayopāttenaivābhiṣavādisaṃskṛtena ca sādhayitavyamiti vidhīyate /	That is to say, the substance Soma, as laid down by the sentence somena yajeta, having been recognised as tending, in some in some way or other, to accomplish the sacrifice, what the sentences, somam krināti, etc., do is to lay down that the sacrifice is to be performed. by means only of such Soma as has been purchased in a certain manner, and prepared into the form of Juice by pounding,etc. Purvapaksha text, p.
na ca mantravarṇasyātyantāvihitacchāgaprāpaṇasāmarthya, paśucodanāvicitasya tu saṃdechāpanayanamātramupayujyate /	, of pointing out the goat, which has not yet been laid down what those words do is to set at rest the uncertainty with regard to the character of the paçu as laid down by the sentence paçuna yajeta. Nor does the verb avadyati necessarily imply sacri fice and even without the sacrifice the verb would mention the mere cutting, which would, by itself, be of use, either in connection with the Veda, or in ordinary life.
dravyadevatāsaṃyogastu na kathaṃ cidyāgādvinā midhyatītyanumāna vaiṣamyam/ na cāvadyatisānnāyyaiḥ prakṛtau coḍhito 'rthagṛhītatvādyatastaddharmaprāptirapi syāt /	On the other hand, the peculiar relationship between the Substance and the Deity, as expressed by the word ‘ aindravā yavam, would not be possible without a sacrifice and as such there is a great difference between the inference or implication of the sacrifice by the sentence aindravayavam, etc., and that by hrdayasyavadyati,etc. The avadyati of the Sannāyya is not laid down in connection with the Primary Sacrifice of the Context under consideration because it is only indirectly implied and as such the qualifications and accessories of that avadyati could not be transferred to the avadyati in question.
na cāsya yāgadravyārthatvamitikarttavyatā yena tadatidigyeta /	Nor is the fact of being for the sake of the sacrificial substance the method of the avadānā cutting and thus too, the said fact could not be transferred as it is only the method that can be thus transferred.
na cedṛśe 'rthe sāmānyatodṛṣṭaṃ prakramate /	Nor in such cases, can we have any operation of the Samanyatodrshta Infer ence towards the inference of the sacrifice.
pūtikābhiṣavaphala camasabhakṣayostu vākyaprakaraṇābhyāṃ tādātmyavijñānamityasamānatā /	As for the pounding of the Putika, and the eating of the Phalacamasa, it is by means of Syntactical Connection and Context that they are cognized as helping in the comple tion of the sacrifice and consequently the case of the pounding of the Putikā is not identical with that of avadyati in the matter of the C implication of the sacrifice.
somavākyepi viśiṣṭavidhau pratyakṣopāte satyānumānikāsaṃbhavādevā tulyatvam /	In the case of the sentences dealing with Soma alsoSomena yajeta, aindravayavam, etc., etc., etc., the qualified Injunction of the sacrifice by means of the Soma being directly mentioned, there is no room for any implied sacrifice and as such the case of these too is different from that of the pounding of the Putikā.
na caindravāyavādivākyepyaṣṭākapālādivākyeṣviva guṇavākyatvepi vākyabhedaḥ /	In the case of the sentences aindravayavam, etc., even if they are secondary sentences laying down accessory materials, there is no syntactical split, as in the case of the sentence agneyoshṭākapālo, etc.” Because, though as mentioning more than one deity Indra and Vayu, the sentence has more than one object of Injunction, yet, on account of there being another action in the shape of the e grahapa, there is every possibility of the Injunction being that of a qualified object.
śakyate hīndravāyvādiviśiṣṭagrahaṇabhāvanā vidhirāśrayitum /	That is to say, the sentence can very well be taken as an Injunction of the Bhāvanā of the grahana qualified by the deities Indra, Vayu and the rest.
arthaprāpte vā grahaṇe samāsopāttaikadevatāvidhānamātramaviru dvam / prakaraṇagnabhyaśca pradhānasaṃbandha iti guṇavākyatve 'pyadoṣaḥ /	Or, it may be that the grahana being necessarily implied, the sentence serves the purpose of laying down a single joint Deity IndraVāyu mentioned by means of the Dwandwa compound and thus there would be no B taka ke incongruity in the case. And as the connection of these with the Primary Sacrifice Jyotishtoma is pointed out by the Context, there would be no incongruity, even if the sentence in question were taken as a secondary sentence laying down accessory details.
tasmādeṣāṃ saṃskāratvādanyato yāgamapekṣamāṇānāmaviruḍo Snyena yāgavidhiḥ /	Thus then, the actions mentioned in the sentences aindravayavametc. having the character of mere Preparatory Actions, they stand in need of the mention of a sacrifice somewhere else and as such there would be nothing incongruous in the fact of such a sacrifice being laid down by another sentence somēna yajēta, etc..

tena codanā paśusomayoriti siddham	For these reasons we conclude that the sentences in question are injunctions of the Animal and the Soma sacrifices.
yatra vākyena saṃbandho nirapekṣo 'vadhāryate / tatra tulyārthavarttitvānopapanna samuccayaḥ /	Sutra Because of difference, there is a repetition of the Action as the substances are distinct, it would be useless to mention another connection hence there is a difference in the grahana specially as it is subservient to the substance.
yadyaindravāyavena yajetendra vāyubhyāṃ vā yāgaṃ nirvarttaye diti śrayeta tato 'nyonyanirapekṣairvā kyaistulyārthatvena jñāyamānā vi kalpabhājo bhaveyuḥ /	As the opponent has not urged the objection based upon the fact of the avadyatis being mentioned in a definite order, etc., etc., with reference to the Paçu, we lay aside this sentence for the present, to be dealt with under Sutra Xvii et seq., where we shall deal with the question as to whether the offering should be cut out from the whole animal, or from each of its limbs, or from only one limb, or only from those enumer ated, namely, the Heart and the rest.
prakaraṇena dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda /	C What concerns us now is the meeting of the objection with reference to the Soma as it is with reference to this alone that the objection has been levelled against us.
yāgasaṃbandhaṃ pratipadyante /	as a matter of fact, however, we find that all of them are mentioned as being connected with the sacrifice simultaneously.
na ca prakaraṇavyāpāraḥ paryāyo yenānyonyanirapekṣāḥ saṃbadhyeran / sarvagrahaṇeṣu di yugapaditikarttavyatātvena gṛhīteṣu tadgatā devatāstanmātreṇāparyavasyantyaḥ prakara binā yāgenākāṅkṣitāḥ yugapadeva saṃbadhyante /	And as for the Context, it does not operate variously or separately and as such it could not connect, with the sacrifice, each individual Deity independently by itself consequently, what actually happens is that all the various grahanas having been simultaneously taken as constituting the method of the sacrifice, the Deities mentioned in connection with these grahanas not having their ends duly fulfilled by that grahana alone, all of them at once, being required by the sacrifice dealt with in the Context, become simultane ously connected with it and as such there is nothing wrong in their being mentioned collectively.
tatra nāma vika lpo yujyate yatretaretaranirapekṣāḥ samānārthe niyujyante / kiṃ kāraṇam	As a rule, too, we accept a number of things to be optional alterna tives when they are mentioned as employed for the same purpose, inde pendently of one another and the reason for this is that in such cases, the individual capability of each of these, by itself, is distinctly expressed by the sentence and hence if they were to depend upon one another, this individual capability would be destroyed and hence they are all accepted to be optional alternatives.
na tviha pratyekaṃ jyotiṣṭoma nirvatana sāmarthyamindravāravādīnāmavagamyate tāhagviniyojakābhāvāt / satyapi ca pratyeka yāganirvarttanasāmarthya tadviśeṣajyotiṣṭomanirvṛttiryathāvacanaṃ vi jñāyataiti naiva pratyekaṃ tulyārthatvam /	In the case in question, however, the capabi lity of accomplishing the Jyotishtoma is not found to belong singly to each one of the deities mentionedIndra, Vāyu,etc. because we have no direct declaration of such capability. Though each one of them has the capability of accomplishing a sacrifice in general, yet, the particular sacri fice, in the shape of the Jyotishțoma, can be accomplished only in the way laid down in the scriptural text and hence each of the deities men tioned does not serve the same purpose. On the other hand, we find the two kinds of corns, the Vrihi and the Yava, serving the same purpose and hence they are taken as optional alternatives specially because each of them is laid down as independent of the other, by independent sen tences, as to be employed in the sacrifice. Objection We find that we have actually a sentence aindravāyavam sentence that follows maiträvar unam grhnati is distinctly recognised as capable of pointing out a deity, independently of the preceding sentence.
pratyekaṃ tulyārthāśca śrīdiyavādayo vikalpa nte, vākyasaṃyogino hi te paraspara nirapekṣāḥ khena svena vākyena viniyujyante / nanvaindravāyavaṃ gṛhṇātīti vākyameva viniyojakamupalabhyate /	are laid down independently of one another but in that case, all of them do not serve the same purpose because being only a purificatory or preparatory action, the grahanas can have only transcendental results and thus varying in each case, and not serving the same end, the various deities mentioned cannot be taken as optional alternatives. Question But how do you conclude them to have only transcen dental results ? L Answer When a certain thing, having been mentioned in connection with the Primary Action, happens to be directly mentioned in connection with the Preparatory Action, then in that case, such a thing serves a visible purpose and so also when, as a matter of fact, the Preparatory Action cannot actually be accomplished without that thing.
ataśca maitrāvaruṇamityetasya pūrvanirapekṣameva devatāvidhisāmathyeṃ vijñāyate	That is to say, if the deities having been previously connected with the sacri fice in the sentence somēna yajeta were again directly mentioned with reference to the grahanas, as they are mentioned in connection with the nirvapa and the avahana or if without these Deities, the grahana could not be accomplished then the mention of the Deities in connection with the grahanas would be for the purpose of a visible end, in the shape of recalling to the mind the Deities in connection with the coming sacrifice.
pūrvaṃ pradhānasaṃbaddhaṃ saṃskāre śrūyate yadi /	Objection When we have come to know that these deities belong to the sacrifice, then, even without a previous mention of these in con nection with the primary sacrifice, we could take all of them as serving the same visible purpose of recalling the Deities in connection with that sacrifice.
tad dṛṣṭārthaṃ vinā tena yadi vāsai na sidhyati / yadi hi prathamaṃ yāgena saṃbaddhāḥ satyo dektā nirvāpāvāhanādiṣviva grahaṇaṇeṣu punaḥ śrayeran /	Reply It is not so because as a rule, it is at the time of the actual Injunction that the purpose served by the factors enjoined is sought after and hence it is with reference to that time that we should ascertain whether the purpose served is a visible or an invisible one. which embodies the method of that sacrifice, yet, inasmuch as the Deities themselves are connected with something i.e., the grahana other than the acrifice, and as they themselves have not the form of actions, they are not pointed out, by the Context, as serving the purpose of accom plishing the sacrifice and consequently, the use of these Deities in connection with the grahana must be taken as something independent.
yadi vā tābhirvinā grahaṇameva na nirvartteta / tatastatra śravaṇaṃ dṛṣṭārthamanāgatasmṛtirūpeṇa ka speta /	of any connection with the sacrifice and such a use cannot but be invisible or transcendental. And this transcendental purpose having been ascertained at the time of the operation of the Injunction in ques tion, if at the time of the actual performance of the Action therein laid down, a certain visible result is found to come about, how could the previously ascertained transcendental result be set aside by that? Nor could any such visible result appearing by the way control the operation of the Injunction in question.
na tvindravāyvādayaḥ prathamaṃ jyotiṣṭomeśrutāḥ / nāṣitatantravārtike / dabhāvena grahaṇaṃ sidhyati	And unless the grahana is not repeated with each deity, the separately mentioned deities can not be connected with the grahana in accordance with the law that that which is done in connection with the Samit is not done in connection with the Tanūnapāta and hence there must be a grahana holding of the Soma, with reference to each deity.
etaddevatāvanti grahaṇāni yāgaprakramātmakatvānna yāgāhate devatārthaṃ dravyaṃ saṃskarttuṃ śaknuvantītyevamapekṣita bhaviṣyati ka vidyāgo ya etāni dravyāṇi devatāsaṃvandhamāpādayiṣyatīti /	Inasmuch as these gruhanas in connection with the various deities are mentioned in a section dealing with sacrifices, it follows that, without a sacrifice, they cannot prepare the substance Soma for the sake of any deity and this leads us to the conclusion that there must be a cer tain sacrifice, that would establish the relationship of the substances with the deities in question. On the other hand, we find that the sacrifice laid down in the sentence somēna yajeta has no deity laid down by the original Injunction nor is the requisite deity pointed out either by Direct Declaration, or by Indirect Indication by the words of the text, or by those of any sentence and as for the Context, it can have nothing toE do in connection with that .e., the Deity which is not an Action and hence the Context comes to point out the fact of the grahanas being per formed in connection with the sacrifice in question.
yāgopi cāvihinadevatākaḥ śrutilāvatāmanabhamānaḥ prakaraṇasya cedṛśe vastanyakriyātmake vyāpārābhāvād grahaṇeṣu māvadviniyojakaṃ bhavati / tāni cāparyāyavidhānādbhinnādṛṣṭasaṃbandhitvācca yugapaddyante tadaśena devatānāmapi samuccayamiddhiḥ	In the case in question, however, the conditions are totally different because in this case, the intervening agency is that of the grahaṇas, and it is with reference to these that the deities are found to be mentioned collectively and hence even though the collection, or aggregate, of the deities may be capable of being taken up with each grahana separately, yet inasmuch as it is through the agency of the grahanas that the deities can be taken up, what could it do in this case but point to the performance of the collective performance of the grahanas also? Objection As a matter of fact, we find that each of the gra hanas has got the capability of helping the Primary Action, by means of the bringing up of the substance Soma, and also by pointing out the requisite deity and thus the case of these grahanas being identical with that of the aforesaid mantras, they must be taken as optional alternatives. Reply Such could have been the case, if the sacrifices in question had been previously cognised as having many deities connected with them as then alone could the various bringings up of the substance be taken as being for the sake of those various deities.
dravyasya gṛhyamāṇasya devatoddeśacodanā / na caikāṃ devatāṃ mulkā taduddeśasya saṃbhavaḥ	These presentations of the substance, too, must differ from one another, on account of the difference among their qualifications the deities as with a single presentation of the substance, it is not possible for many deities to be taken, either singly or collectively. Because as for their being taken collectively simultaneously, this is precluded by the sentences aindravāyayam grḥnāti, maitrāvaruṇam grḥnāti.

yad dravyamindravāyubhyāṃ dātavyamiti saṃkalpitaṃ tasya vyaktaprāyatvādanīśo yajamānaḥ kathamiva vakṣyati mitrāvaruṇābhyāmeta deveti	That is to say, a certain Soma juice having been set aside with the expressed idea that this is to be offered to Indra and Vayu, it is as good as already offered and as such the sacrificer no longer having any control over it, how could he speak of the same juice as to be offered to Mitra and Varuna ? For if an offering once made to a deity, were to be made again to another deity, it would have to be snatched away from the former deity. Or, in view of the previous determination to offer the substance to one Deity, the subse quent determination to offer it to another could never be taken as true and in any case, such an action would mean a most unworthy procedure, and not the fulfilling of the Vedic Injunction.
tenāvaṇyaṃ yāvaddevataṃ grahaṇabhedaḥ karttavyaḥ /	For these reasons, we conclude that the grahana must be distinct, with each of the deities in question.
devatoddeśasvatvatyāgātmako hi yāgaḥ /	That is to say a sacrifice consists of the action of giving away of ones ownership in favour of a Deity and this giving away of ones owner ship or possession over the Soma would be quite possible, in whatever.
śakyate ca pūyamānāvasthenāpi somena krayottarakālaṃ vā sarvāvasthāviyuktenāpi nirvarttayitu mitya śeṣottara saṃskāra vidhānamadṛṣṭārtham /	condition the Soma may be, either in the state of being clarified without putting it into separate vessels, or in any condition after it has been purchased and hence the injunction of the various rites, purificatory and preparatory, of the Soma must be taken as with a view to certain trans cendental results.
yatra tu puroḍāśādi dravyaṃ codyate tatra yāvadavahantyādividhānaṃ tatmaveṃ taniṣpatyarthatvāddṛṣṭārthaṃ bhavati / na ca graha camasasthena somena yaṣṭavyamityatpatticodanā latāmātraparyavasānāt /	In a case where the substance laid down is the Cake, or some such thing, such preparatory actions as the threshing and shifting, etc., of the corn, are found to have a visible result in the shape of the preparation of the Cake as without those actions, the Cake would not be made. In the case in question, however, we have no such Injunction as that the offering must be made out of the Soma kept in the sacrificial cup,etc. because all that the Injunction lays down is the Soma plant and consequently the grahanas, or holdings, of the Soma in the various vessels, though serving to bring about distinct transcendental results, must be taken as collectively helping by these results the accom plishment of the sacrifice.
tenātmīyādṛṣṭabhedanirvṛttyarthamapi grahaṇāni samuccetavyāni saca niyataparimāṇonoda ke nābhiṣuto 'lpaparimāṇeṣu bhinneṣu grahacamaseṣu na grahaṇabhedamantareṇa śakyate grahītu miti bhedena gṛhyate /	And then this definite quantity of Soma having been pounded with a fixed quantity of water, could not be kept in small cups, unless it were held in the hand each time that it would be kept in a cup and as such these holdings grahanas must be many and distinct as there are many cups to be filled with the Soma juice and it is by means of the Soma thus held in the vari ous cups, that the sacrifice is to be performed. And as, unless the sacri fice is repeated over and over again, all that has been just said with reference to the offering of the Soma juice in the various cups dedicated to various deities is not possible,the sacrifice comes to be repeated, for the sake of a definite purpose.
ata utpattau sakṛcchrutasyāpi vākyāntaraprakalpitāvasthotpattikadravyaguṇatvavarśanānuṣṭhānabhedaḥ / tadvi dravyamavaśyaṃ yathāgṛhītameva dātavyaṃ punarekokaraṇe pūrvakṛtagrahaṇabhedavaiyarthyaprasaṅgāt/	not offered up, In view of these facts, we can also take the Sutra as follows tadbhedat, i.e., because of the diversity of the prepared Soma there is a repetition of the action of Sacrifice because of the separateness of the material accepted if all of them were be useless and hence even though in the original Injunction, the sacrifice has been mentioned but once, yet there is a diversity of its performance, because of the fact of the originally enjoined substance being subservient to the various conditions mentioned in other sentences.
na ca tyāgakāle sarvāḥ saṃkalpayituṃ śakyante yenābhyāsabhī taiḥ sarvoddeśena sakṛdeva sarvaṃ dravyaṃ miśrīkṛtaṃ dīyeta tathā kutepi ca bhāgasaṃkaraḥ prāpnotyeva /	The substance, too, must be offered in the same way as it has been held in the various cups as, if the whole thing were to be mixed up again, the previous holding into separate cups would become wholly useless and the deities, to whom the cupfuls have been previously dedicated, would not become connected with possessed of their specified shares nor is it possible for all the deities to be referred to at the time of the single offering hence it is not possible for people, afraid of repetition, to mix up all the juice and make a single offering of it specially as even if this were done, it would lead to a confusion of the shares previously specified.
prakalpite ca bhāganānātve vacanāhate 'vaśyaṃ parihāryā saṃkarāpattiḥ /	And when the shares have been once separately specified, it becomes necessary for the other party to clear up the said confusion, unless of course he has a scriptural text distinctly laying down such confusion.
tasmādyathā saṃkalpitasya pradānātmarvadevatāsamuccaye satyupapannametat/ daśaitānadhvaryuḥ prātaḥ savane grahāngṛhṇātyāśvino daśamo gṛhyate taṃ tṛtīyaṃ juṅkatīti tena siddhamekakarmatvaṃ prayojanam /	Thus then, it being necessary to make the offering as previously deter mined, it is only when all the deities and the grahanas are taken collectively, that the following sentencedaçaitānadhwaryuḥ prātaḥsavane grhnati, açwino daçamo grhati, tam trtiyam juhoti, etc.,etc. laying down the definite order and the summing up of the various grahaṇas becomes explicable. Thus then we conclude that the whole forms a single action of the Jyotishtoma.
pūrvapakṣe somavikāreghvekasyaiva grahasya dharmaiḥ sakṛdanuṣṭhānena bhavitavyam /	The use of the present Adhikaraṇa lies in the fact that, according to the Purvapaksha, among the sacrifices subsidiary to the Soma sacrifice the Jyotishtoma, we would have the performance of the details with regard to one cup, and that, too, only once whereas, according to the Siddhānta, the whole thing has to be done exactly as in the Primary Sacri fice the Jyotishṭoma.
siddhānte tu prakṛtitulya mevānuṣṭhānamiti	Inasmuch as the word juhoti is mentioned but once, the action.
kiṃ nvayaṃ tadvitāntānā mekaśeṣaḥ kṛto bhavet /	In the case in question, however, inasmuch as no other Number of the Action has been previonsly specified, the Number three must be taken as pointing out the separate character of the Actions themselves.
kiṃ vā kunaikaśeṣāṇāṃ paścāttadvitasaṃgatiḥ / yadi prajāpatireteṣāṃ devateti kṛtaikaśeṣeṇa sarvanāmnā nirdiśya tadvitaḥ kriyate /	Reply Not so the action denoted by the word juhoti having no material reality .e., being incapable of being connected with any Gender, Number, etc., the number one cannot apply to it as for the Number singular that is denoted by the affix in the word juhoti, it applies to its Nominative, and not either to the Bhavana or to the Rootmeaning.
atha tu prajāpatirdevatā 'syeti prājāpatyaśca prājāpatyaśceti saptadaśakṛtva uccārya prājāpatyā iti sarūpaikaśeṣaḥ kriyate tataḥ saptadaśaiva dravyadevatāsaṃyogāḥ pṛthakpradarśitā iti pratisaṃyogaṃ yāgānumānātkarmabhedaḥ /	Conse quently when the word juhoti would proceed to indicate a single Homa indirectly by means of the fact of its the word juhoti being mentioned only once, we would be stopped, at the very outset, by the number three mentioned directly in the sentence, and would be led to accept the Homa as qualified by this latter Number, and the action Homa would come to have so many distinct forms. And hence the three Homas must be taken as distinct actions. Though the above was the proper representation of the Adhikaraṇa, yet the Bhashya has expounded it in connection with the sentence sapta daça prājāpatyān, etc., because he means that he will establish the fact of the Number pertaining to the material also serving to distinguish the Actionsa fact that is very difficult to prove.
kiṃ tāvatprāptam /	The ground of doubt in connection with this sentence may be thus explained.
ekakarmeti / kutaḥ yo hi prājāpatyaḥ prājāpatyaścetyevamekaśeṣaṃ karoti tenobhayoḥ prakṛtipratyayayorasāvabhyupagato bhavati tasya ca nimi taṃ bahuvacanānyathānupapattiḥ /	In the word prajapatyan, is the compound ekagesha Dwandwa to be taken as being formed after the appearance of the Nomi nal Affix in prājāpatyān ?or is the Affix to be taken as appearing after the compound has been formed ? That is to say, if the word were explained as ēsha ca, ësha ca, ēsha ca, iti, ēte the Ekuçesha compoundPrāja patiḥ ēshām dēvatā iti Prājāpatyaḥ Prajapati + the deific Affie, tān”,then the word would denote the relationship of a single substance mentioned by the Pronounesha, with a single Deity Prajapati C C and in that case the action referred to would be one only.
na ca tatprātipadike bahuvacanamupalabhyate yena tasyāpyeka śeṣaḥ kriyate /	The Action referred to is one only, because in the word Prājāpa tyan we find the plurality distinctly belonging to that which is denoted by the Affix and as the Ekaçesha compound is due to that plurality, the compounding could not be of the basic noun.
na ca tadekaśeṣamantareṇa pratyayārthasya darśayituṃ na śakyate / vigṛhyamāṇavelāyāṃ sarvanāmnā kathyamānatvāt /	That is to say, one who explains the words as Prajapatyaçca Prajapatyaçca, etc., takes the com pound as belonging to the basic noun as well as to the Affix but the only ground for this lies in the Apparent Inconsistency of the plurality in Prajapatyan but as a matter of fact, we find that the Plurality is not found in the basic noun and as such, this latter cannot be com pounded into an Ekaçesha nor is it such that the Plurality cannot be referred to the denotation of the Affix, without there being an Ekaçēsha of the basic Noun because this Plurality is distinctly expressed, at the time that the formation of the word Prajapatyan is explained, by the Pronoun ēshām.
tasmātmakṛcchruta eva prajāpatirbahubhirdravyaiḥ saṃbadhyate /	Thus then, we conclude that the Deity Prajapati, mentioned but once, is connected with many materials.
kṛtvāpi hi tadvitantenaiva caikaśeṣaṃ na tāvanmātreṇa mucyate punaradṛṣṭā śrutāni karmāṇya pūrvāṇi ca kalpayitavyāni, na ca tāni yatheṣṭaṃ kalpayituṃ labhyantaityuktaṃ śabdāntarādhikaraṇe / ya mātreṇa vinā coditadravye devatāsaṃbandhānupapattiḥ tanmātramevādṛṣṭānamarthāpatyā kalpayituṃ śakyate nānyat /	P Further, when only a little assumption is found to serve our pur pose, it would never do to assume a number of actions, not directly mentioned, and their Apurvas. That is to say, even if we were to accept the latter of the two explanations of the word Prajapatyan, we could not rest with the mere fact of having ng the compound formed after the application of the Affix as it would be necessary for us to assume a number of unseen and unheardof Actions and their Apurvas and that we cannot assume any number of these at our will has already been shown in the Çabdāntarādhikarana in the beginning of the present Päda, where we have shown that we can assume, by means of Appa rent Inconsistency, only that much of the unseen and unheard of, with out which the connection of the mentioned Deity with the enjoined material remains inexplicable as the said Apparent Inconsistency does not warrant any more of the unseen and unheard of.
avaśyaṃ hyekādikrameṇa saptadaśa karmāṇyapūrvāṇi ca kalpayitavyāni /	It would, however, be necessary for you to assume from one to seventeen Actions and as many Apurvas.
tatra prathama kalpanenaivānuṣṭhāna tantratvavada gṛhyamāṇaviśeṣatvātsarvadravyāṇi yāgavanti jātānīti nopariṣṭāgantuṃ śakyate, kiṃ ca	But as the assumption of the very first of these would complete all the Primaries as in the case of the Prayajas,i.e., as the determination to offer the first animal to Prajapati would apply equally to all the other animals, whose case is not found to be different from that of the first, the performance of that single offering will have connected all the rest with the sacrifice and as such, we could not carry on the assumption any further. Then again, the difference of one thing cannot bring about the difference of another for certainly because of there being distinct pieces, in the shape of the Heart, etc., it does not follow that there are different Actions also.
yadi hi dravyabhedānkriyāṇāṃ bhedaḥ syāt/	That is to say, if the diversity of the materials were to make a diversity among Actions, then there would also be a diver sity of Actions on account of the diversity of the pieces of the animals body.
prakṛtau ca kṛtsne paśau yāgasādhanatvena codite tathaivotsraṣṭavye prāpte hṛdayāghekādaśāvadānaprakṛtitvena paśunā yāgaḥ sādhayitavya iti vākyāntaravaśādavagamyate /	As a matter of fact, however, no such diversity is possible, as we shall show later on, under Sūtra VIiii where it is shown that the whole animal having been laid down as the means of accomplishing the Primary sacrifice of the Agnishtoma, and the Animal having to be given away also as a whole, the fact that the sacrifice is to be accom plished by means of the Animal, only as being the source from which the eleven pieces would be obtained, is got at from other sentences and as such the cutting of the pieces becomes a qualification of the Animal, and not that of the Sacrifice.
ichāpi sapradaśānāṃ yāgasādhanatve 'vagate 'tideśena pratyekaṃ sarvadharmāḥ prāpyantaityeko 'pi yāgaḥ saptadaśāvadānagaṇānatideśena gṛhṇanna vihanyate / tasmādekaṃ karmeti prāpta ucyate	In the case in question also, all the seventeen animals being known as the means of accomplishing the sacrifice, the implied direction would apply the process of one animal of its being cut into eleven pieces to all the seventeen animals and as such there would be nothing very incongruous in the fact of a single sacrifice taking up utilising all the seventeen groups of eleven pieces each. To the above, we make the following reply If there were only one Action, there would be a single Injunction in the form of the Subsidiary Sacrifices are to be performed in the same way as the Primary and thereby the material to be employed being pointed out as a single elevenpiece group as the Primary makes use of only one such group, there would be no use for all the seventeen animals.
na hotadetāvatyeva vākyaṃ paryavasyati prājāpatyānpaśṭaniti, kiṃ tarhi prakṛtivadityaparo vākyaśeṣaḥ /	That is to say, the sentence in question does not rest with the declaration Prājā patyan paçun, as there is yet another part of the sentence to be supplied, viz.
ekakarmatve cātra sava nīyaḥ prakṛtirbhavet / taca caiko 'vadānagaṇe yāgasya sādhanadvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	And if there be a single Action, it is the Savaniya, that is, the Primary in question and as at that the sacrifice is per formed by means of a single elevenpiece group, it follows that in the action in question there should be only one such group and as this group, too, in the case of the Primary Sacrifice, is supplied by a single animal which is mentioned by a word wherein the singular number is meant to be significant,it would be the same in the action in ques tion also.
tataścainaiva paśunā si dvattvānna paścantarāṇi prajāpatinā saṃbadhyante iti khapadopāttaṃ bahutvaṃ vākyaprāptaṃ ca saptadaśatvamubhayamapi nānuṣṭhoyeta /	And thus the action having been accomplished by means of a single animal, none of the other sixteen animals would become connected with Prajapati and thereby we would be neglecting the Plurality expressed in the same word Prājāpatyān , as also the number seven teen mentioned in the same sentence.
yadā tu saptadaśa yāgā iti buddhiḥ kriyate tadā pratikarmāvasāyibhisrodakaistā vanta evāvadānagaṇāḥ prāpyante, tatsidyarthaṃ cāśrutānāmapi saptadaśānāṃ paśūnāmāgamaḥ kriyate, kiṃ punaḥ śrutānāmupādānam /	When, on the other hand, the idea accepted is that there are seventeen sacrifices, then the said F z Injunction prakrtivat, etc., coming in for each of the sacrifices, would point to as many elevenpiece groups and for the sake of obtaining these groups, we could have as many animals, even if they were not actually laid down as seventeen and there can be no doubt on the point when the Number is distinctly laid down.
nanu ca pratyakṣaṃ yāgaikatvamutsṛjya na yuktamānumānika codakānurodhena nānātvaṃ kalpayituṃ paśyaḥ /	Objection It does not appear quite proper to reject the directly perceptible singleness of the sacrifice, and assume its plurality on the ground of an implied injunction prakṛtivat,etc. . For whether the sacrifice is one or many is ascertained at the time that the sacrifice is enjoined and it is on this Direct Injunction that an Implied or Extended Direction Atidēça is based and it is never the case that the Direct Injunction is based upon the Extended Direction.
saṃdigdhe vākyaśeṣebhyo nirṇayaḥ prāksamarthitaḥ / sāmarthyāca tadatrāsti iyanirṇaya kāraṇam	That is to say, it is at the time that the Action is originally laid down, that we ascertain the fact of its being one only or many and in all cases the original mention of the Action is by means of a Direct Injunction, and not by an Implied Direction.
prakṛtāvapi caikapaśuniṣpannaikādaśāvadānagaṇasādhyatvaṃ yāgadharmaḥ / na paśorniṣphalatvāt /	For, until the Action has actually appeared as enjoined, there is no question as to its method and until the method has ap peared and is found to be wanting in certain factors there is no Extended Direction. Consequently as the Extended Direction prakrtivat,etc. is found to appear long after the unity or diversity of Actions has been ascertained, no such Extended Direction can rightly be taken as leading us to accept a diversity of Actions.
tadrmatvapakṣe hyavadānairasau saṃskriyeta dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	To the above we make the following reply It has been shown above that whenever there is a doubt, it is always set at rest either by means. of supplementary sentence Sutra iv or by means of Indirect Implications Iiv and in the case in question we find that we have both these means available for ascertaining the doubtful point.
na ca tena prayojanaṃ vināśitatvāt /	That is to say, in the case in question, it is not by means of the Extended Direction alone that we come to accept the Diversity of Actions in fact it is by means of the Direct Injunction contained in the word prājāpatyān itself.
yāgena tu siddhenārthasta saṃbandhinā 'pūrveṇa veti sarvamidaṃ tannirvṛttiprakāratvenāśrīyate /	Though it is true that the Extended Direction appears afterwards, yet, as in the case in question, from the very beginning, the presence of that Direction is known to be as sure as anything else and hence the pa Direct Injunction also comes to be taken in a sense that would not be incompatible with that Direction.
yadyapi cāvadānaprakṛtere katvaṃ saptadaśasaṃkhyayā bādhyata iti nānāpaśuniṣpanna eka eva gaṇo gṛhyatāmiti buddhirbhavet tathāpyekādaśa paśava upayujyeran na saptadaśa / na tvekasminnapi yāge saptadaśabhiravadāna gaṇairyacyata ityanekādṛṣṭa kalpanābhayātpaśuśabdenāvada/	Consequently, even though the interpre tation of the sentence in question is begun with explaining the word prajapatyan as Prajapatirdērata eshām, tan, yet inasmuch as this interpretation is subsequently found to be incompatible with what follows in the Extended Direction, the interpreter, if an intelligent person, does not fail to conclude that he had committed a mistake, at the very outset, in explaining the said word. There is no such rule as that the Extended Direction must always be in keeping with the idea taken up by us in the beginning. Nor is the Extended Direction capable of referring the seven teen elevenpiece groupsnot mentioned in connection with the Primary Savaniya to a single Action or again can a single animal be the source from which all the seventeen elevenpiece groups should be obtained nor is there any doubt on this point, that would be removed by means of the Direct Injunction in the sentence in question. Nor is there an absolute contradiction between the Extended Direction and the Direct Injunction, because the full bearing of this latter is still doubtful and hence there would be nothing to set aside the employing of a single elevenpiece group at one sacrifice.
nagaṇaṃ yāgapratyāsattecayitvā tatpa ricchedārthā saptadaśasaṃkhyā vidhāsyataiti manyate /	And hence the construction of the word in question must be taken asPrajapatirdevata asya, iti Prājāpa tyaḥ, and the ekaçesha would imply the mention of the seventeen Prājā patyas.
naitadevaṃ jakṣaṇākāraṇābhāvāt /	And thus, the connections between the Deity and the Material being diverse, just as in the case of the Agneya, the Agnishomiya, etc., the sacrifices referred to cannot but be accepted as many and diverse.
na hyasati virodhe lakṣaṇā yuktā tenaitahasaṃkaṭamāpadyate /	But this is not quite correct because in the case in question, the Implied Direction does not refer to the Method of the Material because the want of a Method always arises with reference to an Action and as such it stands in need of the properties and qualifications of the Action and not that of the Material.
saptadaśa paśavaḥ karttavyāḥ ekena cāvadānagaṇenaikapaśu niṣpannenaiko yāgaḥ sādhayitavya iti /	As for the sacrifice, there is a distinct purpose served by its accomplishment, as also by the accomplishment of its Apurva and hence the cutting of the eleven pieces, etc., could all very well be taken as the method by which the sacri fice and its Apurva would be accomplished.
na caitatkathaṃ cidanuṣṭhānaṃ śakyam /	So long as there is no incongruity in the Direct Signification we cannot rightly have recourse to Indication.
athānyatrāpi śrutā saṃkhyā nyatrāpi nīyate tato 'pūrvapratyāsannatareṣu vara yāgeṣveva kalpitā / na cāvirodhasaṃbhavātkiṃ cidapi codakasya bādhanīyamityuktam /	And then what the sense of the sentence comes to be, according to you, is this Seventeen animals should be taken up, and a single sacrifice should be accomplished by means of a single elevenpiece group obtained from al single animal certainly such a performance would never be pos sible ! If it be urged that the Number mentioned in one place could be taken elsewhere, then too, it would come to be taken along with the sacrifice, on account of the greater proximity of this with the Apūrva and thus we would have seventeen sacrifices, and not one. And we have already explained above that we cannot rightly set aside any part of the Injunc tive sentence, unless we find it to be actually incompatible.
pramāṇavaśāccānekādṛṣṭakalpanāpi nirderdoṣā /	As for the necessity of assuming an unseen factor, so long as there is sufficient authority and ground for such an assumption, there can be nothing wrong in it. grñgabhiprāyā varṇabhipraya rūpābhipraya va abhavishyan.
etaduktaṃ bhavati / ye saptadaśavarṇādibhedabhinnāḥ paśavasteṣāṃ kaścitprājāpatyaḥ karttavya iti tatrāha /	This has been brought in as a solvent for the sentence that lays down the whole animal as the offering and the sense of the sentence is that from among various animals that may have either seventeen horns, or seventeen colours, or seventeen shapes, one is to be made the Prajapatya. In reply to this it is said in the Bhashya But the animals are subse quently laid down clearly as black, horniess, and hence the seventeen coloured or the seventeenhorned ones could not be meant. And hence we conclude that there are seventeen sacrifices.
prayojanaṃ yadyapi pūrvapakṣavādino nābhipretaṃ tathāpyekasyaiva sājhādyāgasādhanatvamitare tatsaṃkhyāsaṃpādanārthamupādīyante ityeka smādavadātavyam /	The use of the Adhikarana is this Though the Purvapakshi does. not wish it, yet, in accordance with his theory, only one animal would be the means of accomplishing the sacrifice, and the other sixteen would be taken up only for the purpose of making up its enjoined number seven teen and hence the Pieces would have to be cut out of that one animal consequently if there would be anything amiss in this cutting out, it would be necessary, not to take up another animal for the cutting out of the pieces only, but also another batch of sixteen for the purpose of making up the enjoined number with reference to this newlybrought animal.
atha vā 'rddhakṛteṣu saṃ skāreṣu ya eva naṣṭastatraiva samastānāmāvṛttiḥ / nanu ca yathaiva saptadaśasu yāgeṣu sadda kriyamāṇeṣu ekavināśe satyahargaṇe tu yasminnavaccheda ityanena nyāyenetareṣu pratīcyamāṇeṣu sa evāvarttate tathaiva dravyasāhityepi syāt /	Or again, when the purification of the first batch of sixteen would be only half done, if even one becomes amiss, with reference to that, then and there, it would be necessary to repeat all of them over again while according to the Siddhanta, each animal being used in a distinct sacri fice, if there was anything amiss with one, that one alone would have to be replaced, and not all. Objection In the case of the contiguous or joint performance of many sacrifices, we find that if there is anything wrong with the performance of any one of them, then, in accordance with the law laid down under the Sutra VIv, while the other sacrifices have yet to be performed, what is performed over again is only that one sacrifice, and not all of them and the same rule might very well hold in the case in question, where we have a combined or joint material.
naitadevaṃ, tathāhi saptadaśasaṃkhyaikārthamamavāyi vyāsaṅgi yāgasādhanatvamiti tādṛśasyaivopākaraṇādibhirmavitavyam/ tatra yadeva dravyaṃ naṣṭaṃ tenaiva vinā yathāmādhanavināśo jātaiti sarve saṃskārāstiṣṭhat khapi dravyeṣu sādhanātpracyutā iti punarādita eva karttavyāḥ /	Reply This is not possible because in the case in question, we find that the capability of accomplishing the sacrifice in question inheres in seventeen of the same object, i.e., the seventeen animals taken as a single object and as such, like the number, it appertains to all of them taken col lectively consequently the purificatory ritesupakarana and the restof these should be performed as such a whole consequently, when even a single animal out of these would die during the purification, there would be a destruction of the exact Material for accomplishing the sacrifice and hence, even though the other animals be quite intact, the purificatory rites of the material as a whole would have gone wrong and as such these rites would have to be done all over again.
na ca saptadaśatvena vināsya sādhanatvamastīti tatmidvaye 'vaśyamitare'pyapekṣitavyā iti/	But even when a fresh ch animal would be brought in, the rites would appertain to that animal only, as forming the Material for the sacrifice and as the exact character of the Material would not be attained by that one animal unless it be accom panied by the other sixteen animals,it would be necessary to bring in a fresh batch of seventeen animals, each time that there may be the slightest mistake during the performance.
siddhānte tvanyonyanirapekṣa sādhanatvaśaktiyuktānāṃ sahaprayogamātraṃ kriyate ityupapannā tanmātrāvṛttiḥ /	In accordance with the Siddhanta, on the other hand, each of the animals has the character of the Material, independently of the others and what is done is only the performance of the sacrifices together and hence in this case if there is anything wrong with regard to one animal, it is that one alone that has to be replaced.
nanvevaṃ sati pūrvapakṣanyāyena stotraśastreṣu tāṃ caturbhirādatte ityādiṣu caikamantravināśe samastāvṛttiḥ prāpnoti /	B Objection If what you say is true, then, according to the Purvapak sha, in the case of the Injunction Stotraçastreshu tancaturbhirāduttē, if there happens to be something wrong in the reciting of one Mantra, all the Mantras would have to be repeated.
na, tatra pratyekaṃ sādhanatve sati vacanena samuccayāśrayaṇāt /	Reply Not so in that case each Mantra forms a distinct means by itself, and what the Injunction does is only to mention them collectively.
yatkurvāṇā hi te mantrāḥ stotrādīni mādhayanti tatraiṣāṃ pratyekākāṅkṣānivarttanasāmarthyam/	As a matter of fact, in all that the Mantras do, with regard to the making up of the Hymns, etc., they have each a distinct capability of supplying a distinct want in the shape of the pointing ont of the requisite Deity, e.g.
anyathā hyekamantranaiva syāt /	a as otherwise all of them would form a single sentence according to the Sutra IIi.
bhinnaireva ca prātyātmikairmantrakāryaiḥ saṃhatya kāryāntaramārabhyate na mantreṣu vyāsaṅgi māghanatvam /	Thus then the fact is that each Mantra having fulfilled its own specific function, the effects of all these functionings com bine to bring about another effect in the shape of a transcendental potency, etc., and the character of aiding the sacrifice does not belong to the Mantras taken collectively.
paśūnāṃ tu vyāmaṅgītyuktam /	In the case of the seventeen Animals, however, it is found to belong to them taken collectively as a single whole.
mantrakā ryāṇāṃ tarhi saṃhatyakāritvādekavināśe samastāvṛttiḥ syāt / naitadasti sādhanavinā śavyatirekeṇa kāryavināśābhāvāt /	Objection The effects of the Mantras, then, acting conjointly, if there were anything wrong with one, all of them would have to be repeated. Reply Not so because when there would be nothing wrong in the cause the Mantra, there could be none in its effect. Specially as the action of man appertains to the Means of accomplishing a certain action, all performances should be regulated by mistakes in these Means and not by those in the effects. Sutra Name also serves to distinguish Actions be cause of its occurring in the originative Injunction.
sādhaneṣveva puruṣasya vyāpāra iti tadvināśānurodhenaivānuṣṭhāna mi ti viśeṣaḥ	Or, it may be that inasmuch as the gift of a thousand rests upon the previously mentioned Jyotishtoma, the particular result mentioned in connection with this gift may be taken as following from the employ ment of this accessory gift in connection with the same Jyotishtoma just as the employing of different accessories at the same sacrifice, such as dadhi, and milking vessel, is laid down, with a view to particular results, in the shape of the obtaining of an organ of sense and Cattle respectively.
anukta karmaśabde yā saṃjñā pūrva pravarttate /	That is to say, in a case where the Action has been already laid down by means of a previously pronounced Verb, before the Name comes to be mentioned, the unity or diversity of the Actions concerned having, in this case, already been ascertained elsewhere by means of the verb, the subsequently appear ing Name would not distinguish the Actions.
na vastvantarabuddheḥ sā kathaṃ cidapanīyate	But so long as there is no such recognition of identity, there is nothing to set aside the idea of difference naturally afforded by the difference of Names.
saṃjñānadīvyavacchinno yajiḥ pūrvaṃ na gacchati / na ca pūrvastamityevaṃ banādarthāntaraṃ gataḥ siṃcaśabdaḥ kva cigauṇo māṇavādau nirūpitaḥ /	Consequently then, the subsequent yaji being separated from the previous Context, by the river of the name gauh, cannot go over to it nor does the previous context go over to it and hence perforce it goes over to another object. Thus, then, the word atha, not being able to be taken as signifying either a reference to what has gone before, or immediate sequence, is taken as serving the purpose of introducing another Action. The word esha also, being expressive of that which is perceptibly near it, is as applicable to what has gone before as to what appears subsequently, because both are equally perceptibly proximate to it and hence the signification of this word does not affect the discussion.
nājambheśrayamāṇopi tadarthaḥ parigṛhyate	As for the rejection of the previously mentioned and the acceptance of that which has not been mentioned, as it has to be accepted on the strength of the Direct Mention of the Name, there is nothing wrong in it.
tantravārtika /	That is to say, they are not mentioned with refer ence to a previously enjoined Action..
guṇacāpūrvasaṃyoge vākyayoḥ samatvāt	As for the sentence vasantē vasantē Jyotisha yajeta, we take the word as indirectly indicating the Jyotishtoma and not directly expressing it, because of this fact being pointed out by other means of right notion.
ataḥ paraṃ prāka prakaraṇabhedād guṇanimitto bhedābhedavicāro varttiṣyate /	Te Sutra An accessory also serves to differentiate Actions, when it is a new one, and incapable of being connected with the foregoing action because both the sentences are equally inde pendent of each other. Before dealing with the differentiating of Actions by Context, we proceed to consider the Diversity and Unity of Actions based upon their Accessories.
cāturmāsyeṣu vaiśvadeve parvaṇi vaiśvadevyāmiśceti dravyadevatāsaṃyogānumitaṃ yāgaṃ vidhāyocyate vājibhyo vājinamiti /	In connection with the Caturmasya sacrifices, with reference to the Vaiçvadeva Parva, we find the sentence vaiçradevyāmiksha, which serves to lay down the sacrifice implied by the connection between the Material and the Deity herein mentioned and following on this we find the sentence vājibhyo vājinam.
kiṃ tasminneva karmaṇi guṇavidhiḥ utānenāpi dravyadevatā saṃyogena yāgāntaraṃ kalpyate / tatrobhayamapi dravyadevataṃ pūrvatra vidhīyate iti pakṣaḥ saṃbhavannāpi nopanyastaḥ /	And on this point there arises the following doubt Does this second sentence lay down an accessory Mate rial for the sacrifice laid down by the former sentence, or does it serve to lay down a distinct sacrifice implied by the particular connection of the Material and the Deity mentioned in itself ? Though there was a third alternative also possible, namely, that both the Material and the Deity mentioned in the second sentence are laid down with reference to the previous sacrifice, yet this has not been put forth because it has been shown in the Adhikarana dealing with the Paurnamasi sacrifice, that it is not possible for many accessories to be laid down in connection with an Action that has been already enjoined by a previous sentence.
pramāṇāntara prāpte karmaṇyaneka guṇa vidhānasya paurṇamāsyadhikaraṇe ni rākṛtatvāt /	Because of the word Vāji being taken as one who has vāja or Food, and the Food meant being the āmikshā that has been laid down in the immediately preceding sentence Vaiçradevy amiksha, it is the Vaiçvadevyāmiksha, Viçvedevas themselves that are denoted by the word Vajibhyaḥ and the action too referred to in this second sentence being the same as that laid down in the former sentence, what this second sentence does is to lay down a new Material, in the shape of the Vajina.
tena vājinameva kevalaṃ kiṃ pūrvasminkarmaṇi tayā ca devatayā saṃbadhyate, uta devatāntareṇa yāgāntareṇa cāpūrveṇa saṃbadhyataiti / kiṃ prāptam pūrvacaiva vājinaguṇa vidhānamiti /	These Deities the Viçvedēvas are already impressed with the connection of the sacrifice previously implied by the first sentence consequently, when, with a view to establishing their relationship with a sacrifice, we find that the material Vajina, we come to assume there is no reason why we should set aside the sacrifice that is pointed out by the word vāji which is synonymous with Viçvēdevās, and as such points to the sacrifice implied in the former sentence and while we have that sacrifice, there arises no further Inconsistency with regard to anything else and hence we conclude that in the second sentence we have the same sacrifice, the same Apurva and the same Deity as those in the previous sacrifice and as such there is no reason for assuming any other sacrifice.
kutaḥ anantaropadiṣṭena vājenānnena vājinaḥ /	Nor is the connection between the Vaji and the Vajina understood to be independent of that sacrifice because there can be no mutual relationship between the two nouns them selves.
viśve devāḥ pratīyante tacca karmeha vājinam	That is to say, each of the two connections between Deity and Material that the two sentences speak of, not allowing the presence of the other, as incom patible with itself, lays down a distinct Action.
guṇāntara/varudvatvātpūrva karmaṇya saṃbhavāt /	Objection It is true that when the subsequently mentioned acces sory is found to be inapplicable to the previously mentioned Action, it indicates another Action.
kriyāntaramatiṃ kuryādātmasaṃgataye guṇaḥ tadvitena caturdhyā vā mantravarṇena ceṣyate /	But in the case in question, why cannot the accessory, Vajina, be connected with the previously mentioned sacri fice or its Deity ? Reply The only reason for this nonconnection lies in the fact of that Action having its material already laid down as something else.
devatāsaṃgatistatra durbalaṃ ca paraṃ param	But that is not possible because the two are not equally strong in the authority of their applicability to the same sacrifice.
devatāsaṃgatiḥ śrutyā tadvitantāpratīyate / caturthyantāttu vākyena padadvayasamīpataḥ /	And in all cases, there are three methods of mentioning the Deity By means of the deific nominal affix, by the Dative case ending, and by means of the words of the Mantra used and among these that which precedes is always more authoritative than that which follows.
vaiśvadevīti hi śrutyaiva devatāsaṃbandhaḥ pratītaḥ /	If it be urged that the character of the Deity is mentioned directly by the word ‘võiçvadevi, while it is only the connection of the material amiksha that is implied by the syntactical connection, then this is also found to be the case in the other sentence, where the character of the Deity being mentioned directly by the dative ending in vajibhyaḥ it is only the connection of the material Vajina that is implied by syntactical connection.
itaratra tu vājibhyo vājinamiti padadvayasāmopyādgamyate / nanciāpyāmiścāpadasaṃnidhānavaśenaiva dravyadevatāsaṃbandhaḥ pratīyataiti tulyaṃ vākyagamyatvaṃ bhavet/	And further, granted that the Direct Denotation of the Nominal Affix mentions the connection with some material in general even then, inasmuch as the Vajina also is included in the object in general, there would be nothing incongruous in taking this latter also as the specified material for the same sacrifice as held by us the only incompati bility would be between the two particular materials, the Amiksha and the Vajina and both of these being equally indicated by syntactical conuection, there would be no difference between the authoritative charac ter of these.
devatātvaṃ vākyena dravyasaṃbandhaḥ sa ihāpyaviśiṣṭaḥ /	And as such they must be taken as optional alternatives.” Reply The Nominal Affix does not denote the Deity of the material in general what it does is to express the Deity of the particular material mentioned by the word asya which is present in the expression saʼsya devata, which expresses the presence of the Nominal Affix.
caturthośrutyā devatātve'bhihite vākyena dravyasaṃgatimātrakaraṇāt / atha dravyamātrasaṃbandhe tadvitāntenaiva kṛte viśeṣamātramāmiśrāpada sannidherbhaviṣyatītyucyate /	For instance, in the case in question, the Nominal Affix in the word Vuiçvudevī being explained asviçvēdevā devatā asyah, the pronoun asyah expresses, not the material in general, but the particular material in close proximity with itself specially as it is only a particular object, and not the indefinite generic class object, that is capable of being utilised. Consequently that the object expressed by the basic noun Viçvedevāḥ” is name of the Deity of the particular material pointed out by other means.
vājibhya ityeka padenaiva saṃpradānaṃ bruvatā saṃpradeyādinā taḍhanupapatteḥ sāmānyākṣepe sati vājinapadasaṃnidhānena viśeṣamātrapratīteḥ /	is the direct denotation of the Nominal Affix in Vaiçvadēvi. Thus then, the idea of the particular material, as bearing in itself the parti cular relationship, and as being subservient to the Deity, is brought about directly by the word with the Nominal Affix, independently of every other word and we proceed to look out for the particular material whose Deity has been mentioned by means of the Nominal Affix and then it is that this is pointed out by means of the word āmikshā.
tattu dravyamācaṃ vājinepyavi śiṣṭamiti na virudhyate /	And thus as the connection between the Material and the Deity has been mentioned before the appearance of the qualified idea, there is in this case no need of an Indirect Indication.
tayośvobhayatra vākyannabhyasaṃvandhatvādaviśeṣaḥ /	Thus then, in the sentence vaiçvadevyāmikshā there are two relation ships the Relationship of the Material with the Deity, and the Relationship of the qualifier and the qualified and of these the former is directly mentioned by the word, while the latter is indicated by Syntac tical Connection.
tena vikalpaḥ prānotyeva / taducyate viśve devā devatāsyā iti cina sarvanāmnā dravyasāmānyamabhidhīyate /	For this reason, the qualification of the word āmikshā by the word vaiçvadevī is not through the meaning of these words as it is in the case of the expression nilotpalam what the fact is, is that the Nominal Affix itself directly denotes the Āmīkshā together with the Deity Viçvedevāḥ and the particular material referred to by the pronoun asyah in the expounding of the Nominal Affix is indicated by the proximity of the word amikshā.
kiṃ tarhi sannihito viśeṣaḥ sa eva vyavadārakṣamaḥ nānirūpitaṃ dravyamātrama/ ataḥ prātipaṭikena yortha upāttaḥ sa dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	That is to say, in the case in question, it is not that the word with the Nominal Affix denoting one object, and the word amiksha denoting another, the qualification of one of these by the other applies sub sequently because this relationship is expressed, at the very outset, by the word with the Nominal Affix but what actually happens is that the word with the Nominal Affix having the capability of expressing that which cannot be utilised that is, the Material in general, it stands in need of the proper particular object for itself and then what the additional word amikshā does is to present to it this particular object and thus, as a matter of fact, through the proximity of the word amiksha, the word vaiçvudēvi itself denotes the material amikshā.
pramāṇāntaragamyasya dravyaviśeṣasya devatetyetattadvitena śrutyaivīcate /	Nor does the Amiksha become the meaning of the sentence because that which is denoted by the word with the Nominal Affix is not As a matter of fact, we have a known to have a separate existence.
tatra yadā tāvatprāgeva viśiṣṭa pratyayātsaṃbandhobhihitaḥ tadāna lakṣyamāṇo bhavati /	sentence, only when there are at least two independent denotations of words.
athāpi prakṛtipratyayayoḥ svārthavṛttayoreva nairantaryādantarāle saṃbandhavigamyamāno bhavati tathāpyatraikapadasthatvātpadaiya saṃnidhigamyāinīyānvijñāyamānaḥ śrīta ityucyate /	Thus then, all that the word amiksha does is to bring forward that which is denoted by the word with the Nominal Affix and as such it does not remove to a further distance and thereby render weaker the direct denotation of the Nominal Affix. It is with a view to all this that we have the following declaration It is by the Direct Denotation of the pronoun asyāḥ that the meaning of the second word amikshā is denoted and as that is expressed by the Nominal Affix, all the three the Pronoun, the Affix and the Amiksha become deno ted by the single word with the Nominal Affix Vaiçvadēvi. Thus then, what is denoted by the word vaiçvadevi is that that which is the Amiksha And hence in this case, is to become connected with the Deity Viçvedevah.
tesaṃbandhāveko dravyadevatāsaṃbandha/paro viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāvaḥ /	In the case of the sentence Vajibhyo vājinam on the other hand, the case is wholly different.
tatra pūrvaḥ śrotaḥ uttaro vākyalakṣaṇa iti viśeṣaḥ / aśva naivātra nīlotpalādivadarthadvāra vaiśvadevyāmikā śabdayorviśeṣaṇaviśeṣyatvaṃ, kiṃ tarhi	to Because, firstly, in the sentence vajibhyo vajinam, the material to be offered is not denoted either by the noun vajin, or by the Dative affix in the word vājibhyaḥ nor do any of these express the connection of that Material with the Deity and hence we cannot cognise these by any other means save the syntactical connection of the two words. That is say, in the word vajibhyah, either the basic noun, or the affix, or both of them together, express either the material in general, or a particular Material, or the connection of some Material with the Deity all that the word denotes is that the object signified by the noun is the recipient and certainly there is no idea of the relationship of the material included in the word and hence it has to be cognised by means of the syntactical connection, based upon the proximity of the word vājinam.
āmikṣāpade nānyaḥ paścātayorviśeṣaṇaviśeṣyatā, taddhitāntavācyasya prathamapratītaḥ/	C And secondly, in the case of the word vaiçvadevi, we find that the signification of the Pronoun asyāḥ is included in the Nominal Affix but in the case of the word vajibhyah the Dative is not laid down in the sense of that at of which the object signified by the basic noun is the receiver of the gift.
tenāmikṣāpadmannidhibanā īśvadevīśabda eva tāmabhidhatte / na cedānīmā miśca padasyānuvādatvaṃ, tena vinā taddhitāntasya tadviṣayatvāpratīteḥ / na ca vākyārthatvaṃ, ta dvitāntapadārthasya pṛthagaprasiddheḥ /	That is to say, in the case of the former, we find that the Nominal Affix has been laid down by grammarians in the sense of that of which the object signified by the basic word is the Deity while the Dative has not been laid down in the sense that that which is signi fied by the basic noun is the receiver of that a certain gift and as such in the case of a word with the Dative ending, there can be no indication of the meaning of the Pronoun asya and as a matter of fact, what such a word actually expresses is the mere character of the Recipient and hence, it is only on account of the inconsistency of the mention of a recipient, without the object to be received, that the word with the Dative can give rise to a desire on our part for some such thing and certainly this does not make this thing to be directly expressed by that word as, in that case, all that is signified by the sentence would become the denotation of that word.
svatantrī padārthāvagṛhītvā vākyārthaḥ pratīyate tenābhidheyopanayanamātrakāritvānna taddhitaśrutairāmiśrāpadenārthaṃ viprakarṣaḥ kriyate /	All that the said desire raised by the Dative does is to bring about the requisite relationship when the other word is uttered for if there were no such desire raised by the first word, even the second word could not bring about the said relation ship. C Thus, then, though the Dative Affix directly denotes the deific character of Vajin, yet its relationship with the Material vajina is indicated by syntactical connection alone.
vājibhya iti tu nātra prātipadikena vibhaktyā vobhābhyāṃ vā dravyasāmānya viśeṣatatsaṃbandhānāmanyatamada pyabhidhīyate /	Our contention is with regard to this relationship of the Material and the Deity and there is no doubt that the relationship of the Material vajina with the Deity Vajin as. indicated by syntactical connection is very much weaker in authority than that of the Amiksha with the Viçvedevas, because this latter is men tioned directly by the Nominal Affix in the word vaiçvadevi.
tatra na kathaṃ cid dravyasaṃbandhaḥ padentargata ityavaśyaṃ vākyenaiva vājinapada sāmīpyāta pratyāyayitavyaḥ / api ca / yathehāsya padārthopi tadvitentargataḥ smṛtaḥ /	Further, it is a wellrecognised fact that that which is expressed directly by the word is more nearly related to it than that which is indicated by syntactical connection, this latter being very much remoter than the former and hence we proceed to show how, what you hold to be the sense of the sentence vajibhyaḥ,etc. is far remote from the direct signification of the words.
sarvaprakāramāmikṣāsaṃbandhasya sannikarṣannavaṇaṃ śrautatvam /	For instance, in the case in question, the relationship of the amiksha with the Viçvedēvas being in close proximity to the word, is recognised as being expressed directly by the word while the relationship of the vajina with the Vigvedevas being far removed, is recognised as indicated by syntactical connection.
yadyapi tāvad dravyaviśeṣasya taddhito na brūyāddevatātvaṃ tathāpi sāmānyasya tāvad bravīti na caturthyantena sāmānyamapyucyataiti viśeṣaḥ /	Though the Nominal Affix in Vaiçvadēvi does not express the fact of the Viçvedēvas being the Deity of the particular Material amiksha, yet it does express the fact of their being the Deity of some Material in general while the word with the Dative ending does not express anything with regard to any material, either general or particular and this makes a great difference between the two cases. It has been argued above that the material in general expressed by the Nominal Affix in Vaiçvadevi could also pertain to the vājina which would thus come to have the Viçvedevas for its Deity.
vaiśvadevīti hi strīpratyayena samānapadgatenaiva strodravyaṃ kimapi sannicitamityavadhāryate / na ca vājinasya khītvaṃ sannidhirvāstīti anāśrayaṇam /	But this is scarcely correct because in the word vaiçvadēvī’ we find a feminine ending, which, though appearing in connection with the generic term, yet distinctly points to the fact that the material meant must be that which is mentioned by a word in the feminine gender that may be found in close proximity with the former word and none of these conditions which are fulfilled by the amiksha are found to be fulfilled by the vajina, as it is neither mentioned by a word in the feminine gender, nor is it in close proximity with the word vaiçvadēvī and as such this latter is not accepted as the material in connection with the Vięve dēvas.
vājibhyo vājinaṃ kuryāditi naivāsti saṃgatiḥ / tatra tatmiye'vaśyaṃ dānādhyāhārakalpanā	The relationship of the vajina with the Vajins is not mentioned in the form vajibhyo vajinam kuryat and hence for the mention of that relationship, we must supply some word expressive of giving and the like.
na ca vājibhya iti kāraka vibhaktiḥ kriyāpadādanyena saṃbadhyate na ceca tadupāttam/	As for the word kuryāt denoting performability, this has got to be supplied even in the sentence dealing with the amiksha, either from above, or out of the final sentence laying down the actual performance of the Action in question and as such the question of the expression of this performablity has not been urged against the opponent.
tata ekārthatvātparasparaniyama iti viprakṛṣṭatā/ na tvāmicāyāṃ taitkiṃ ciditi sannikarṣaḥ / satyapi ca vājivājinayoḥ sākṣātsaṃvandhe vaiyadhikaraṇyādviprakṛṣṭatvam / vaiśvadevyā mitetitu sāmānādhikaraṇyātmannikṛṣṭatā /	In the sentence vajibhyo vajinam, however, the said relationship is wholly uncognisable, until the root da =to give is supplied from above though in the expression vaiçvaděvyamiksha we have the relationship directly expressed by the Nominal Affix, which leaves nothing that could have to be supplied from above. And the reason for this is that in all sentences, there are only two ways in which the relationship of nouns is expressed viz., either by the mention of coextensiveness, or by the word in the genitive case and in the sentence vajibhyah etc., we do not find either coexten siveness or the genitive word and as for the caseending in vajibhyaḥ, it cannot being a caseending be related to any word other than the verb and we do not find any verb mentioned hence it becomes neces sary to supply the verb from above this is one ground for the aforesaid remoteness.
saṃpradānatvamātraṃ ca caturthī vājināṃ vadet /	And the other lies in the extremely complicated nature of the connection among the three words vājibhyaḥ, vājinam and dadyat. It may be argued that in the case of the sentence vaiçvadēvī etc., also there is an equal necessity for supplying the verb sacrifice.
nanu taddhitepyanekā patyādyarthasaṃdecāttulyametat / viṣama upanyāsaḥ /	But the two cases are not parallel, because in the case of this latter sentence, the sacrifice is inferred after the relationship of the amiksha with the Viçvedevas has been fully cognised and the cognition of the relation ship does not depend upon the verb to sacrifice.
arthaḥ punayogyatvāditarāsaṃbhavena devatātmako nirpoṣyate bhavatastu nirṇo te'pi śabde catuṭayarthānekatvādupapadakāra kalavaṇa saṃdehādastyeva viprakarṣaḥ / nenārthasaṃdeha ubhayoḥ samatvānneka śvodyate śabda saṃdehattva sādhāraṇatvāccoditaḥ /	For you, on the other hand, the mere fact of bringing about the ownership of another person which is implied by the Dative ending being impossible without the mention of the sacrifice, the sacrifice, would be necessary for the bringing about of a cogent relationship among the factors expressed by the word and hence, from the very beginning, it would be necessary to assume the verb to give, for the sake of the establishment of the syntac tical connection between the word denoting the Material and that denot ing the Deity. It is only when this verb to give has been supplied, that the nouns, previously disjointed, become joined in a common boud of relationship and thus both these words, having the same purpose, come to restrict each other and this process is very complicated.
yathā cotpattiśiṣṭasya balīyastvaṃ na ca kriyāmācaṃ niṣkṛṣya guṇāntaraṃ vidhātuṃ śakyate tathoktaṃ citrādhikaraṇe vaiśvadevādhiraṇe ca /	In the case of the sentence Vaiçvadēvyāmākshā on the other hand, there are no such complications, and the process is very much simpler. CO Though the Vajin and the vajina are directly related to each other, yet none of their terminations being such as to express a extensiveness between them, there is a distinct remoteness between them.
vaiśvadevādhikaraṇanyāyena ca prakaraṇamapekṣitavyamapara vājinavākyena /	In the case of the sentence Vaiçvadēvyāmiksha on the other hand, there is a distinct coextensiveness expressed by the common Nominative ending and hence we have a proximity between them as we shall explain, later on, how the words having the same endings are more cap able than those with different endings.
kutaḥ /	vājina.
dravyadevatasaṃbandho yāgamātramapekṣate / āmiyāyāga eveti tatra prakaraṇābhavet	Because the Dative is not, like the particular Nominal Affix, laid down by grammarians as denoting the Deity as all that it is said to express is the character of the Recipient and certainly the Recipient is not the same as the Deity for in the sentence he gives the gold to Atreya, Atreya cannot be taken as a Deity.
vākyārthaccāvayavārthī samuccitya saṃvandhaṃ kalpayitvā sā bhavantī śrutimātropanipātalabhyāyāḥ samudāyaprasiddherdurbalā bhavatīti dubelataraḥ saṃyogo vājinasya / vājiśabdopi vā 'śva suniḥ svabhāvataḥ /	Then again, that object which operates towards the accepting of a gift, is called the Recipient while we do not find the Deity operating towards any such accepting therefore all that we can have the Dative do is to indirectly indicate the Deity as one with reference to whom the gift would be made, which is something that comes before the Recipient or, it may be taken as indicating the ownership that follows after the possession of another person the Recipient has been brought about because the character of the Deity is known to be identical with such ownership. Even if the character of the Deity be held to be that of the Recipient in the shape of one not denying the gift, this would entail the indication of a character not compatible with the general character of the Deity and this would be a very farfetched and com plicated process.
sarve hyagnyādayaḥ puroḍāgādibhirannairvājino vijñāyante tatrāmijhāyāṃ tāvadannaśabdaḥ prayukto na puroḍāśādā vityekaḥ klemaḥ /	There is yet another cause of remoteness, in the shape of the doubtful nature of the word vājibhyaḥ, which can be taken both in the Dative and the Ablative whereas in the case of the Nominal Affix, there being no such doubt, the intellect has not got to be overstrained. That is to say, when we come across the word vajibhyah, until we have set aside on certain grounds its ablative character, and decided to take it as the Dative, the mind is in the tossing state of uncertainty.
punarapi cāmikṣāmātragrahaṇe sati vaiśvadevyāmikṣayaiva tadvatāṃ grahaṇamityaparaḥ /	The opponent argues that the signification of the Nominal Affix in vaiçva devi is also doubtful, inasmuch as there are many meanings of that Affix, in the shape of the Patronymic and the rest.
tataśca svarasena śrutiranyatrāpi varttamānā satī prakaraṇenaiva viśeṣe sthāpayitavyā, na ca tatra kiṃ cinnimittamasti / guṇabhāvenopādīyamānatvāddevatāyāḥ /	But this argument is not quite relevant, or on the same lines as ours because what we have urged was the verbal doubt in connection with the word vājibhyaḥ while you have brought forward a doubt with regard to the meaning for in all cases, whatever the meaning, the word vaiçvadēvi can not lose its character of ending in a Nominal Affix and as for the meaning, we settle unor its denoting a Deity, because we find none of the other signi cations of the Affix compatible with the sentence.
saṃskāryatve ca vrohīnprocatītyādiṣviva kathaṃ cidapūrvasādhanalaśaṇayā prakadvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda / tagrahaṇaṃ bhaveta, na cātra tadasti /	For you, on the other hand, even when after a long cogitation the word vajibhyaḥ has come to be ascertained to be in the Dative, inasmuch as there are many meanings of the Dative, there always remains a doubt as to whether the Dative in question is an Upapadavibhakti or a Kārakavibhakti and thus also the latter being accompanied by a double doubt, this is certainly more farfetched than the former. Specially as the doubt with regard P to the meaning, being common to both of us, cannot be urged against any one of us only while as for the doubt with regard to the word itself, it occurs in your case only, and not in mine, and as such can very well be brought forward against you.
vināpi tena karmaṇa prayoja navattvopapatteḥ / kāmaṃ vājinasyaiva pratipattiḥ saṃskāro bhaveta, na devatāyāḥ / prakṛtagrahaṇe cāgnyādīnāṃ sadbhāvādanavadhāraṇam /	AS Then again, the āmikshā is related to the sacrifice to the Viçve devas, which is pointed out as implied in the same sentence where it is itself mentioned whereas the vajina is, according to you, related to the sacrifice the same as the above which is pointed out in another sentence. And there can be doubt as to the greater authoritativeness of that material which is mentioned in the same sentence along with the sacrifice at which it is employed. Nor is it possible for the second sentence to draw out the sacrifice only from the former sentence, and then to lay down another material the vajina in connection with it because the impropriety of this has been shown under the Adhikaranas dealing with Oitrā and Vaiçvadēva Pada IV, Adhyaya I.
atha viśvadeveṣu sarve saṃgṛhītā bhaviṣyantīti teṣāṃ grahaṇam /	Then again, in accordance with the rule laid down under the Adhikarana on Vaiçvadeva, the sentence mentioning the vajina would stand in need of the further help of the Context.
sarvasaṃgrahasyāpramāṇakatvāt / bahuvacanaśrutyā sarvagra haṇamiti cet /	Because the relationship of the Deity and the Material spoken of in the sentence vājibhyo vāji nam only stands in need of some sort of a sacrifice and that this sacri fice is the same as that at which the previously mentioned amiksha has been employed, could only be ascertained by means of the Context.
na tasya triṣveva caritārthatvāt na, triṣvavadhāraṇajñānamiti cet /	That is to say, the vajina, not being capable of being related to the Deity Vajins without a sacrifice, stands in need of some sort of this latter and then the conclusion, that the vajina also is a part of ie., is to be employed at the same sacrifice as that at which the amikshā is used, can be got at by means of the Context alone.
tasmānna viśvedevagrahaṇe kiṃ citpramāṇam / sākāṅkṣā ca devatā dravyeṇa saṃbadhyeta mā cātra vājiśabdena dravyavatyevo?pādīyamānā nirākāṅkṣava pratyāyiteti na dravyāntarasaṃbandhaṃ kṣamate, tasmādatulyavannatvam /	Thus, then, even though it be by Syntactical Connection alone that the Viçvedēvas are pointed out as the Deity for the offering of the amiksha, yet we find that the amiksha is mentioned independently of anything else and inasmuch as the vajina could be taken as forming part of the same sacrifice, by means of a Syntactical Connection that depends for such signification upon the Context, the employing of the amiksha is found to be dis tinctly more authoritative than that of the vajina and this makes a great difference between the two theories. If then, the vajina be con nected with a sacrifice, independently of the Context, there being no other known sacrifice cognised along with it, we would come to conclude that it belongs to an independent sacrifice by itself but in this, the vagina being separated from the Vaiçvadeva sacrifice, you would be land ing upon the Siddhanta standpoint.
anyena navaruddhe hi guṇo yatra vidhīyate / tasminguṇavidhiḥ śakya iti karma na bhidyate homo hi prakṛtaḥ śuddhaḥ svavākyādavadhāritaḥ /	sentences as do not directly mention the action of the human agent, until some sort of a sacrifice has been inferred in connection with them, they do not stand in need of the help of any other sentence. And in the case of the sentence Vājibhyo vājinam when the sacrifice has been inferred, or implied, within itself by the relationship between the Vajins and the vajina, this relationship becomes duly established and as such the sen tence could have no need of any other sentence of the Context such as Vaiçvaděvy amiksha and consequently there would be nothing to show that the sacrifice spoken of in this latter sentence is the same at which the aforesaid vajina would be employed.
sosmin didhiviśiṣṭatvādvibhāgenaiva gamyate tānyutpattimapekṣante sā cāvyavahitā yataḥ /	In the case of the sentence vaigvadēvī, etc., the Viçvedēvas as connected with the amiksha are expressed by means of the fully recognised signification of the word viçvedēvu as a whole contained in the word vaiçvadēvī while with the vajina mentioned in the other sentence they could be connected only by means of the farfetched signi fication of the brokenup constituent parts of the word vajibhyah.
guṇādīnāṃ tvasaṃvanvāyavadhiḥ syātparasparam	That is to say, the Vievedevas could be spoken of as vajins only by taking this latter word in the sense afforded by its component parts.
dvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda / vākyāntareṇa tatkarma yathā danā viśeṣitam / taṇḍulādibhirapyevamiti naikātmakaṃ bhavet	And as such a signification of the word could be got at by joining to gether the sense afforded by the two parts of the word vaja+ in and this would be exactly like the meaning of a sentence which is got at by joining together the meanings of its constituent words and as such it could not but be very much weaker in authority than the wellrecognised meaning of a word as a whole, which is always obtained by a mere men tion of the word and for this reason too the connection of the Vajina with the Vaiçvadeva sacrifice is very much weaker than that of the āmikshā.
dadhyatra daśame pakṣe tadbomasya viśeṣaṇam /	Den The word vājin as a whole is actually found to have such well known significations as the horse and the like and hence to take it as signifying the Viçvedevas would entail much needless trouble.
nityaṃ cendriyakāmasya tenāpi na nirūpyate yatta dravyaṃ na pratyabhijñāyate na tatkarmabhedakāraṇam /	Because, as for the character of the Deity, it must always be taken in precisely the same form as that mentioned by the word, no attention be ing paid to the capability or incapability of that which is so mentioned and that character does not depend upon the generic class Dēvatātva and hence too the word vajin could not by the mere generic character of Devatatva be taken as referring to the Viçvedevas.
tasmāttadeva karma gumātrābhyadhikaṃ phaje vidhīyate/ naitadevam/	Thus then the word vajibhyah would directly denote the fact of the Horses being the Deity and hence to take it as referring to the Viçvedevas would necessitate, without sufficient cause, the taking of that word in the much less authoritative sense afforded by its constituent parts and this makes another great difference between the two theories.
karmagabde'guṇe'pyatra karma bhūyo vidhīyate / phalaṃ hi śrutametasminkarmatastacca yujyate	C its constituent parts, as that sense would equally refer to all the Deities that may be connected with the offering of the Cake because the Cake is a food, vaja, just like the amiksha and hence to restrict the word to the Viçvedēvas alone would entail a further effort.
yadyasya kāraṇabhūtaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ siddhe dṛṣṭāntadharmiṇi taccetmādhyepi pakṣe kāraṇabhūtamiti gamyate bhavati tattasya sādhaka miti / a to vacanātkāryakāraṇayoreva gamyagamakabhāvo bhāṣyakārābhidvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	For instance, all the deities, Agni and the rest, would come to be pointed out by the word vajin, on account of their being connected with such foods as the Cake and the like and hence your theory would, at the very outset, necessitate the gratuitous assumption that the word food, vaja in the word vajin , refers to the amiksha, and not to the Cake,etc. and then again, there would be another assumption that, though the word vaja refers to amiksha in general, yet it points to that particular amiksha which is offered at the Vaiçvadeva sacrifice, and that as such the word vajin indicates those i.e., the Viçvedēvas to whom that parti cular āmikshā is offered.
tattvayuktam / akāryakāraṇabhūtānāmapyanityatvakṛta ṛtvādīnāṃ gamyagamakabhāvaprasiddha /	Thus then it comes to this Though the word vajin directly by itself refers to many other Deities, yet, by means of the Context, it is restricted to the particular Deity the Viçvedevas.
yadi tarhi parīkṣitena ca kāraṇenābhihitena kāryamidamabhidhīyate / danendriyakāmasyetyatra vākye yatkarma tatphannavatkarmatvāt kuṣyādivat /	And we see no ground for this recourse to the Context because the Deity is always mentioned only as an accessory detail and as such if it were spoken of as something to be purified or prepared like the vrili in the sentence Vrihin prokshati, then somehow or other, on account of the fact of such purification helping the Apurva of the sacrifice, there could be established connection with the Deity mentioned in the same Context .
evaṃ hi śate kadā cidihāpi karmanimittameva phalaṃ vadet /	In the case in question, however, we do not find the Deity mentioned as something to be purified because even without its having the form of such purification, the action mentioned is found to serve a distinct purpose.
indriyakāmavākye dadhi phalavad dravyatvāttantuvat /	Even if the sentence could be taken as mentioning a purification, this latter could only be in the form of the utilising of the vajina, and it would have nothing to do with purifying the Deity.
yathaiva hyayaṃ hetuḥ karmaṇaḥ phalavatvaṃ phalamya vā karmajanyatvaṃ sādhayati evaṃ dṛṣṭaphalatva ma śabdagamya phannatvaṃ brīhyādyanyatamaphalatvaṃ vā sādhayati / tasmānnaivajātīyaka kāryakāraṇabhāve samastahetudoṣasaṅgādetadbhavati / kvacid dṛtantravārtika /	For even if the sentence were to refer to the Deity mentioned in the same Context, there would be no certainty as to which one Deity is meant, as there are many Deities, Agni and the rest, that are mentioned in the Context. It may be argued thatinasmuch as all the Deities would be included in Viçvedēvas which word means all deities it is the Viçvedēvas alone that we take as referred to by the sentence in question.
yaddā itikaraṇānta eva praśnaḥ /	But this is scarcely right because there is no authority for the collecting of f all de deities.
śabdenāvagamyametatphala miti bhāvārthādhikaraṇopanyāsena uttaram /	If it be urged thatall are included, on account of the direct mention of the Plural number in vajibhyah,we deny this because the Plural number may rest with three only.
tasmādbomātphala miti nyāyyam /	only. Therefore there is no ground for taking the Viçvedēvas as referred to by the word vājibhyaḥ.
api ca dadhyubhayamasamarthaṃ kartumiti/ na tāvatkarmānapekṣasya dadhnaḥ karaṇatvamasti / yena kevalaṃ phannasaṃbandhyeva syāt /	It is only when the Deity stands in need of some fact for making its mention explicable, that it becomes connected with a Mate rial and in the sentence in question, inasmuch as, in accordance with your theory, the Deity mentioned by the word vājibhyaḥ has its Material already supplied in the shape of the vaja , and as such it is actually cognised as having all its wants duly supplied by the same word, it cannot be taken along with any other Material in the shape of the vajina, whose connection would be based upon syntactical connection.
ata ubhayatra vi dhātavyaṃ, na ca taccakyamiti /	And as such there is a deal of difference between the authoritativeness of the two theories.
nan kambala nirṇojana vaḍhiti prāsaṅgika karmasaṃbandhābhiprāyeṇa vastvamāmarthyanirākaraṇārthaṃ vā /	And further, it is always by means of Direct Assertion that the Deity becomes connected with its sacrifice and in the case in question we find that the direct mention of the Viçvedevas by the word Vajin is hardly possible.
dadhyabhayamamamarthamiti yathāśrutena paravacanena vamtvasāmarthyamevoktamiti dṛśyate /	If in connection with the offering of the vajina also, the Viçvedevas themselves be accepted as the Deity, then, in all places where the sacrifices are recapitulated, it would be necessary to pronounce the word Viçvedeva.
na vayaṃ vastusāmarthyamapahumahe, kiṃ tarhi samarthepi vastunyavicitāḍhanuṣṭhānādavabhyaṃ dadhyabhayārthatvena vidhātavyam / na caitadasti, aneka saṃbandhakaraṇe vākyabhedapramaṅgāt/	But in the case in question we find that this word is not mentioned in the sentence that serves as the Injunction of the Vajina offering i.e., the sentence vajibhyo vājinam, which uses the word vājīn and not Viçvēdēva and as such a direct mention of the Viçvedēras in this connection is hard to be got at as the only way it could be got at would be in the following manner the word vajin has a literal signification as the sentence in which that occurs does not men tion the sacrificial detail in the shape of the Deity, the word indicates indirectly the word Viçvedēva and then this latter word comes to be laid down as the one which is to be uttered at the time of the offering of the Vajina.
praśnaḥ /	This would be a highly complicated process.
siddhāntavādī tu pratyayārthavidhitvaṃ dhātvarthānuvādatvaṃ ca tyanupapattekha yataḥ kurtāvaddhātoḥ para uccārayitavyaḥ /	Then, too, if the denotation of the word vagin were to indicate a word, this latter could be in the forms sarvedevāḥ, nisçēshadēvataḥ, and so forth, all of which are synonymous and as such it would be extremely difficult to get at the precise form Viçvēdēva.
nanu śrutyā homasaṃbaddha meṣa yatra ka cana dhātāvupādātavye prāpte prakaraṇaprāptahomopādānamabhāvanocyate /	And when some other word sarvēdēvāḥ is pronounced, it cannot point to the fact of the particular Deity of the Viçvedevas being the Deities concerned as we shall show later on, in Adhyāya X, that the Deity of an Action is always recognised precisely in the same form as it is mentioned in the Injunction Xiv. In the sentence vajibhyah, etc., we find that the human agent is urged to the offering of the material to the Deity mentioned by the particular word vajin and as such, at the time of the actual offer ing, the Deity should be mentioned by pronouncing the precise word vājin and not any of its synonyms.
satyaṃ bhāvārthādhikaraṇanyāyena śrutivalīyastvāprāptonuvadiṣyate / yathā ca na vibhaktervacanamevaikaṃ prayojanamiti devamanyatrāśritam / iha ca ye bhavadīyaṃ pakṣamāśrayeste śrutima grahādiṣu kārakamātrapratipattyarthamuccāryamāṇanāntarīyakatvāpavādheraṃstarām /	Thus then, even if it be granted that the same Deity of the Viçvedēvas is mentioned by means of the word vajin in connection with the offering of the vajina, and by the word Viçvēdēva in connection with that of the amikshayet, in ac cordance with the law laid down above in connection with the words Indra and Mahendra vide Sutras IIi,inasmuch as the Deities in question are mentioned by two distinct words, they must be regarded as wholly distinct and consequently the second sentence must be taken as mentioning a quite different relationship of Deity and Mate rial and then, inasmuch as it is not allowable for many accessories in the shape of the Material vājina and the Deity Vājin to be laid down in regard to a sacrifice that has been previously enjoined .e., the Vaigvedēva sacrifice, we come to the conclusion that in the case in ques tion the mention of the accessory vājinam serves to distinguish this latter Action from that which is laid down by the former sentence.
katham	In continuation of the sentence .
tyayānugrahārthamapi dhāturuccāryamāṇaḥ saṃbandhabacādavivakṣitamapi svārthaṃ pratyāyayati/ na hi tasyārthapratyāyanamātramevaikaṃ prayojanamiti vaktavyam /	agnihotram juhoti, we find the sentence dadhnendriyakāmasya juhuyat and this gives rise to the following doubt Does this second sentence lay down an Action different from that laid down by the former sentence ? or does it only serve to mention a distinct result as following from the offering of a particular material at that same sacrifice ? Two conclusions have been previously arrived at If the original Injunction of the Action contain the mention of no accessory, the accessory mentioned in a subsequent passage pertains to the Action laid down by that injunction if the original Injunction contain the mention of an accessory, there being no possibility of the connection of more than one enjoined accessory, the mention of another accessory per tains to another Action.
nanūcyamāne 'pi iti pratyayānugrahārthaṃ dhāturustokāryavidhisaṃbhave tāvadvidhāyako bahutarārthavidhānamupeca te/	In the case in question, we find that the sentence laying down the original Action ugnihotram juhoti does not mention an accessory and the other sentence cited mentions more than one accessory viz., the Material dadhi and the Result acquiring of sense efficiency and there arises a doubt as to the likelihood or otherwise of these latter appertaining to the former Action.
homasya ca phanabhāvanākaraṇatvādbhāvayeṭindriyaṃ homenetyecāryamāṇaḥ svārthaṃ pratyāyayatīti/	For the purpose of settling this doubt, we have got to settle at first the question as to whether the Result mentioned in the second sentence follows from the Homa, or from the particular Material Dadhi.
na cāsya grahakatvavada vivadyāvamavasthitasya karaṇabhūtenaiva daghnā samatvātsaṃvandhe 'nupapadyamākāraṇaṃ kiṃ ciḍhasti / tasmādyathābhilaṣita kevalakarotyarthāsaṃbhane 'vaśyaṃ matvarthanakṣaṇā parigrahītavyā dadhimatā homeneti / vādasamarthameta diti/	B Question How is it that the Bhashya has totally neglected the sentence godohanëna paçukāmasya pranayet, which had been cited in connection with the present Adhikarana by the author of the Vrtti? C Reply The only reason is that the sentence in question is of no use in showing whether the two Actions are identical or different. If the question at issue were as to whether the particular Action serves simply to T help the completion of the sacrifice, or it accomplishes something that is desirable for the agent, then, in that case, there would be a difference between the case of the sentence cited by us and that cited by the Vrtti as however at present we are dealing with the question of the diversity or identity of Actions, it is necessary that the sentence cited should be one that would help in a satisfactory conclusion being arrived at, in connection with the question at issue.
na ca dadhiśabdasyāsati rthānapāyāttāvanmātreṇa prayojanasiddhiḥ / yastu homasaṃbandha kṛto pravṛttinimitte karmanāmadheyatvaṃ ghaṭate / soyamubhayasmād bhraṣṭo viśeṣo nāsau kiṃ cidviruṇaddhi /	The bringing in pranayana, spoken of in the sentence cited by the Vrtti, being of the nature of carrying a certain thing from one place to another, is not affected one way or the other by the diversity or identity of the Actions concerned as whether the Result follows from the milking vessel, or from the bringing in by means of that vessel, in any case, the performance of the main Action would be exactly the same. In the case of the sentence cited by us, on the other hand, if the Result followed from the material Dadhi, then Dadhi would be the material that should be offered in the morning and evening Libations of the Agnihotra whereas if it followed from the Homa, then this Homa of the Dadhi, having no fixed time for its per formance, would be wholly different from the AgnihotraHomas, the time for which is fixed and thus having the character of an independent.
prakārāntareṇa vā bhāvanāṃ dadhiśabdo 'narthaka eva prāpnoti / tataśca śabdadharmasaṃnikarṣānuviśecyati/	Action by itself, like the Darvihoma, it would be performed only once, and independently of the Agnihotra and thus in this case a great difference is made in the case by the Action being different. Objection Even if the Result followed from the Homa, in accordance with the law Sannidhau tvuvibhāgāt IIiii , the Action laid down would be the same, just as the actions laid down in the sentences yāvajjivamagnihotram juhuyat and agnihotram juhuyāt svargakāmaḥ are the same as the original Agnihotra.
nanvevaṃ sati sa eva doṣa iti /	Reply It is not so because as a rule, if the Action subsequently mentioned be recognised as not being different from the one mentioned previously, then the Actions are taken to be the same otherwise they are concluded to be different.
siddhāntavāguṇasamabhivyācārapakṣe tu na kasya cihnādhaḥ /	When an Action is laid down with reference to a certain Result, and in connection with a certain occasion, etc., it could not be connected with these latter, unless it had been previously enjoined and hence it proceeds indirectly to acquire the character of the originative Injunction.

homāśrito guṇaḥ phanḍaṃ sādhayiṣyatīti /	Because the Homa mentioned in the previous sentence Agni hotram juhuyat is pure and simple, while that which is mentioned in the sentence in question is qualified by the Dadhi and as such this latter is cognised as different from the former.
vyatirikta evāyamiti / katham / yathaivāṃśatrayāpekṣā bhāvanā 'nyatra gamyate tathā guvaśiṣṭāyāṃ caturtheśo 'pyapekṣyate	That is to say, the Action originally laid down in the sentence agnihotram juhoti is Homa pure and simple, while that in the sentence is one qualified by Dadhi, and hence we do not have, in this case, the nondifference spoken of above as the only cluded to ground for identity and consequently the Action is con different from the previous one.
agnihotramevetikarttavyateti / ta tvayuktam /	M Objection The Homa qualified by Dadhi is also found to be previ ously laid down by the sentence dadhna juhoti found in connection with the Agnihotra and as such the sentence dadhnendriyakāmasya juhuyat cannot be taken as laying down an Action never mentioned before.
karaṇavyatiriktatvāditikarttavyatāyāḥ / homasya ca prāmuktena nyāyena karaṇāṃśāvyatirekādato 'gnipraṇayanādikaivāgnihocetikatrttavyatetyu cyate /	Reply Not so because the sentencedadhna juhoti is not the originative Injunction of any Action because the Action, for which this sentence lays down an accessory material, has been originally laid down by the sentence agnihotram juhoti where it is not qualified by the Dadhi while the sentence wherein it is qualified by Dadhi i.e., in the sentence dadhna juhoti is not its originative Injunction, as has been fully established under the Sutra tatsannidhergunarthena punaḥgrutiḥ IIii.
kuta etaditi /	as an originative Injunction.

Because all these accessory details stand in need of the original mention of an Action and because this ori ginal mention is found in close proximity to those sentences while as for the details themselves, inasmuch as they are not related to one another, they would be removed from one another by the originative Injunction. That is to say, inasmuch as an Action not originally laid down cannot be connected with any accessory details, all these details stand in need of the original Injunction of the Action and there is no ground for any mutual relationship among the Details themselves.
saṃsthādhikaraṇavipratiṣiddha samāna vidhānatvābhyupagamāpattecodanāliṅgasya ceti /	As for the origina tive Injunction, inasmuch as it pervades through all the sentences laying down the accessories in connection with the Action enjoined by that In junction, it is not interrupted by any foreign factor, in its relationship with each one of the details.
punaratideśanyāyopanyā sādasaṃbaddhatvam /	And for this reason, the sentence dadhna juhoti does not present itself in connection with the sentence dadhnendriyakāmasya juhuyāt. This will be further explained under the Adhikarana Ekasya tübhayatvē sanyogaprthaktvam IViii.
ata evaṃ vaktavyam āśrayayopasthitena homenopakāra pradānakrameṇetikarttavyatāyāḥ sannidhānādavideśanimittasya ca codanāliṅgasya juhotyarthasya darśanāt / yasmādeva cāyaṃ codanāliṅgatvena ja hotyarthaḥ prakaraṇātprāpto 'nuvadivyate tasmādasyotpatteḥ phalaṃ vā prati pratyayo na vidhāyakaḥ /	The following might be urged here The same originative Injunction agnihotram juhoti as qualified by the Dadhi mentioned in another sentence Dudhna juhoti, might present itself in connec tion with the sentence Dadhnēndriyakāmasya juhuyāt, and set aside the idea of the diversity of Actions. But this would be scarcely possible as, in that case, just as that Action Agnihotra is qualified by the Dadhi mentioned by another sentence, so in the same manner is it also qualified by many such materials astandula, payaḥ and the like, also mentioned by other sentences tandulairjuhoti, payasa juhoti,etc. occurring in the same Context and hence the Action could not be of one form if in the Injunc tion itself any signification were attached to the mention of accessories in other sentences.
ata āha na cānyadbomasyotpattivākyaṃ vidhāyakaṃ nāstīti /	That is to say, in the originative Injunction Agni hotram juhoti the Action is found to be pure and simple and hence this cannot be recognised as the same as that mentioned in the sentence dadhnēndriyakāmasya juhuyāt.
ke civanyathā 'sya vacanasyārthaṃ varṇayanti/ na cānyaddadhiphalādindriyādagnihotrahomasya svargādi phalaṃ nāsti/	Nor can the sentence in question be construed as yad dadhna juhoti tad indriyakāmasya because this would make the Result the object of the Junction, which is absurd. The real construction of the sentence is this when one desires senseefficiency he should offer the Homa of dadhi and dadhi alone and there is no doubt that no such Homa has been laid down anywhere else.
svavākyena prāptatvāditi/	Objection The form of the Homa alone would be recognised as the same and this recognition would establish the identity of the two Actions.
tattvanāśaṅkitā prastutopanyāsādasaṃbaddha miti pūrvoktameva jyāyaḥ / tasmānna karmāntaraṃ, kiṃ tarhi tasminneva karmaṇi danaḥ phalaṃ homaścānugrāhakaḥ /	Hence it must be admitted that what the sentence in question does is to mention the same Action as the previous Agnihotra, with the additional mention of an accessory Dadhi. Reply It is not so because we have already shown above that with reference to an Action previously laid down, more than one accessory detail can never be laid down and in accordance with what you say, the sentence in question would come to lay down more than the relation ship viz., that of the Material dadhi and the Result senseefficiency . And hence the sentence in question laying down the relationship of the dadhi and the Homa, and then again that of the Homa and the Result, there would be a syntactical split.
athavā tenaiva tantravārtika /	And for this reason you must accept the sentence to be a qualified Injunction.

In the case in question, however, we find none of these condi tions present as the material, dadhi, has been previously laid down by another sentence dadhna juhoti and the sentence in question mentions a Result senseefficiency over and above what has been spoken of before. It is with a view to all this that the Bhashya has summed up the Purvapaksha in the words we find a distinct result mentioned in the sentence in question, and a distinct Result can, rightly speaking, follow from a distinct Action only.
ato dadhna eva phannamityeṣaiva vyākhyā yujyate /	then we have the retort, nēti brūmaḥ,etc. And in this way various questionings and answerings go on up to the sentence tasmānnaivan jatiyakeshvētad bhavati Bhashya, p.

Anaikantika doubtful character of the Premises, viruddha premises proving the contrary conclusion, and so forth. For instance, if the inferential argument put forward be in the form the Homa brings the result, as it is actually seen to bring about the Result, then, inasmuch as the premises bringing forward of the Result form part of the conclusion, it is wholly incapable of right ly leading to the said conclusion.

It might be argued that there are other things more similar to the Cultivation than the Material and as similarity is always compara tively relative, when we are looking for something very similar, that which is only slightly similar is as good as not similar at all and hence when we are looking out for the common character of Action as inher ing in the Cultivation and in Homa, the similarity of the transient character, etc., of the Material becomes far removed and as such it is taken as dissimilar. ball projekatarken But in that case, inasmuch as we find many other Actions, such as Eating and the like, which have a still closer similarity with Cultiva tion than the Homa, as these Actions like Cultivation bring about visible results which the Homa does not do n view of this much closer similarity between Eating and Oultivation, that between Cultivation and the Homa may be rejected as being as good as non existent. And as such, this similarity could not serve as the means of getting at the desired conclusion. This has also been declared elsewhere, in the following words We do not find any absolute similarity between Cultivation and the Homa and as for the presence of a slight similarity, this is found in the Material also and as such the fact cannot be ascertained on the sole ground of similarity.

But this interpretation of the Bhashya is not correct because we actually find such properties as kṛtakatva that of being a product leading to the conclusion of anityàtva imper manence, in which case there is no relation of cause and effect. And even between the cause and the effect, the cause does not serve the purpose of pointing out a particular effect, in the same way as the effect points to the cause because there are many effects of a single cause and as such there is always a chance of mistake in the former case.

And if on this examination, it is found that the similarity is such a cause, and as such points to the desired effect, then the form of the argument would be In the sentence, dadhnendriyakama ya, etc., that which is the Action brings about the Result, because it is an Action, like Cultivation, or that the Result mentioned is to be brought by an Action, because it is a Result, like the growing of corns. The Bhashya puts forth another syllogismthat which is an Action has a distinct Result,etc. And this serves to present a counterargument that makes the efficiency of the previous arguments doubtful.
kutaḥ / naiva hyanekasaṃbandhādvākyabhedaḥ prasajyate / aneka vidhiśaktyā hi bhedo, nāsti ca sotra naḥ	As the Bhashya proceeds to explain that there are cases where, even after the Action of Substancesthat of the threads for instancehas ceased, we find certain distinct results in the shape of another substancethe cloth. following not from the Action but from the conjunction of those substances the threads.
tathā hi / revatīvāravantīyasaṃbandhavyāmṛte vidhau /	And in reply to this the Bhashya has indicated a counter argument, that in the sentencedadhnēndriyakāmasya,etc. the Dadhi brings about the Result because it is a substance, like the aforesaid threads or that sense efficiency is brought about by substances, because it is a Result or effect, like the aforesaid Cloth.

Thus, then, inasmuch as we have all these discrepancies cropping up, if we accept the aforesaid causal relation, it does not follow that because a certain thing is seen in one case, it must be present in another place also.

revatīṣu vāravantīyaṃ kṛtveti niṣpādite hi saṃbandhe yajeḥ pareṇa liṅā phantasaṃbandhaḥ kevantaḥ karttavyaḥ /	That is to say, it might be argued that inasmuch as the sen tence involves the Injunction of the appearance of the connection between Revati and the Vāravantiya, and then an Injunction also of that Connection with reference to the Result, there would be a repetition of the Injunctive affix, which would give rise to a syntactical split.

That is to say, in the sentence in question, on account of the mention of an Accessory, the potency of the Injunctive, being removed from that which is expressed by the Verbal root yaji, serves to lay down that accessory, for the sake of the particular result and as such lagt at it is found to lay down that which has not been cognised as subservient to anything else.

And all these facts distinctly point to the conclusion that the Action sacri fice mentioned in the sentence in question is none other than that laid down in the previous sentence and as such, inasmuch as that same Action is referred to in the sentence in question, the Injunctive affix in this sentence will not be put to the trouble of laying down the Action, over and above the Accessory.
karmāntarapakṣe tu sarvamaprāptatvādvidhātavyam /	While if the sentence be taken as laying down a distinct Action, as in that case nothing will have been previously laid down, the Injunctive affix would have to enjoin all that is necessary.
na ca tallabhyate / kutaḥ / ekaśaktiḥ svabhāvena sarvadeva vidhāyakaḥ /	And as a matter of fact, no such injunction of all things is possible because the Injunctive, by its very nature, is always endowed with a single potency and when its purpose is fulfilled by the Injunction of even a little thing, it can never enjoin any more than that.
alpārthavidhisaṃtuṣṭo nānekārthavidhikṣamaḥ āśrayatvena gṛhṇāti yo guṇāḥ prakṛtī kriyām /	And as such, there being no necessity of accepting a manifold potency of the Injunctive, there can be no doubt as to the superiority of the theory that the sentence in question serves only to lay down an Accessory with reference to a previously mentioned Action.
tatsaṃbandhānuvāḍhatvottatra bhedo na gamyate tathā hi /	It is with reference to this, that it has been declared that though the Sama is inherently capable of accomplishing the Hymning, yet as no such Hymning is pointed out by the Context, it cannot be taken as the substrate of the Sama in question.
devatādravyakartṛbhyo nātiriktamapekṣate / yāgaḥ sādhanamityevaṃ sāmnā naivaiṣa sādhyate	Nor would the Varavantiya become wholly useless, by not being connected with any previously mentioned Action as it will have its use in the new Action that would be laid down by the sentence in question. And further, inasmuch as the action of Hymning is wholly differ ent from that of Sacrifice,by accomplishing the former, the Varavantiya cannot be said to have accomplished the latter.
āha ca /	And as such there can be no similarity between the sentence saptadaça,etc. and the sentence in question.
stotrasādhanabhūtatvaṃ sāmno yogyatayā sthitam /	For if the Hymn called the Agnishtoma Sama be taken as the required substrate indicated by the sentence itself, then there would be a syntactical split the sentence laying down the fact of the Varavantiya being based on the Agnishṭoma Sāma, and also that of its bringing about the particular Result.
stotraṃ ca prakṛtaṃ nāstītyāśrayo na pratīyate	And as there is no reason for rejecting the Varavantiya that is connected with the Agnishtoma Sama of the Sacrifice previously mentioned in the Context, there can be no question as to a connection with any other Hymn or Sacrifice.
phacāya vihitaṃ sāma svatantraṃ rūpamātrataḥ /	To the same effect, we have the following declaration That Sama which is laid down as independently, by its own form, bringing about the Result, stands in need of the text of the Veda only, for the propose of its appearance.
vedasvādhyāyamevai kamutpattyarthamapekṣate	As a matter of fact, however, we find that in the case in question, the Sama depends, for its appearance, on the Vedic text only and it is as taken directly from the Veda that it is laid down for the sake of a definite result.
naikaprayatna mādhyatvaṃ kriyāntara viśeṣaṇe / tena kriyāṃ vidhāyānyastatra kāryaḥ punarvidhiḥ	Because the qualifications of two distinct Actions cannot be amenable to the own one same injunctive effort, when an Injunction has served to lay Action, we should have recourse to another Injunction for the purpose of laying down another Action.
kṛtvāśabdārthamevaikaṃ gṛhṇote bhāvanottarā /	Reply The latter Bhavana which is signified in the word yajēta takes in, as its subject, only that which is denoted by the word krtva and that Bhavana too which is denoted by this latter word would take in only that qualification which belongs to its own specific object.
revatovāravantīyasaṃbandhaṃ niṣpādyottarabhāvanāpekṣo 'vasthitaḥ svaviśeṣaṇa viśiṣṭaḥ kṛtvāśabdārthaḥ kratunā gṛhyate /	Then, when the new sacrifice mentioned in the sentence in question has taken up the Rk Revati and the Sama Vāravantiya, the position assigned to the Revate would be in accordance with the Sama that has its position already ascertained. foo That is to say, while the denotation of the word kṛtvā,after hav ing established the relationship between the Revati and the Varavantiya is waiting on the lookout for the second Bhavana , it becomes taken up, as specified by its qualification in the shape of the said connection between the Varavantiya as based upon the Revati verses, by the Sacrifice mentioned by the root yaji in yajeta.
ataśca svaviśeṣaṇāśceṣa eva kratoḥ /	And consequently what the sacrifice implies is its own quali fication and not that of any other Action.
tena yadyapi atra vākye 'gniṭomasāma na vidhīyate tathāpi ṛtuviśeṣaṇamapi tatra saṃkrāmatītyadoṣaḥ / ataśca prakṛtayāga saṃbandhastvatpate vāravantīyasya nāsti /	That, however, which is denoted by the word krtvai.e., accomplishing or bringing about is not directly connected with the said relationship of the Rk and the Sama and as such, inasmuch as that relationship comes to have a subordinate character, it is relegated to the subsidiaries of the sacrifice and consequently, in accordance with the Varavantiya, which has its position already known by indirect implication, the Rēvati verses also come to be referred to the same Vāravantiya. Thus then, though the sentence in question does not lay down the Agnisktoma Sama, yet the qualification of the Sacrifice extends to that Sama, and as such there is no incongruity in this. For the above reasons, it is clear that, in your theory, there is no relationship between the sacrifice in question and Väravantiya.
ātmanā hyakriyā rūpairguṇairāśrīyate kriyā / vāravantīyagītesta kriyayā kiṃ prayojanam	the Vāravantiya, inasmuch as it is sung and as such forms an action in itself, what can it have to do with another Action the Sacrifice, for instance ? That is to say, in the case of such accessories as the Dadhi, the Milking vessel and the like, we find that, without an Action, their very character of Instrument cannot be attained and as such they stand in need of some such Action.
sarvacaiva yatredaṃ kṛtvedaṃ kuryāditi śrūyate tatra yadi tāvakvāntadhātuvācyā kriyā 'nyata eva prāptā tato nimittārthaṃ śravaṇāṃ bhavati /	The expression bhinna vākyēshu means that though in the case of both theoriesi.e., whether the sentence in question be taken as mentioning a particular result following from the employment of a certain accessory in connection with the action mentioned in the previous sentence, or as laying down an altogether distinct Action, the meaning of the second sentence would be different from that of the former, and as such the sentences would be distinct yet the distinctness of the two sentences would be better justified by both of them laying down two distinct Actions because otherwise, there would remain a certain semblance of the two sentences forming a single compound sentence which would not be quite justifiable in face of the distinctness of their significations.
atha tu na prāptā tata uttarasyāḥ karaṇaṃ pūrvanirvṛtyutta rakālatvena vihitaṃ tāmananuṣṭhāya yathā karttuṃ na śakyataityarthā davaṇyaṃ karttavyā satī vihitavadvijñāsyate /	But thus too, the sentence is made to lay down three distinct facts and as such syntactical split becomes inevitable and further, as for the Agnishtoma Sama, we cannot speak of its connection as being either enjoined or only referred to in the sentence in question. If this connec tion were enjoined, then inasmuch as the mere presence of the Agnish toma Sama has been pointed out by the previous Injunction, the word etasya would be absolutely useless and such an Injunction would also involve a syntactical split.
na ceha revatīvāravantoyasaṃbandhaḥ prāgvidheḥ kutaścitprāpto yena nimittatayā 'śrīyeta /	Objection The relationship of the Revati and the Väravantiya could not be enjoined because as there could be no injunction of a qualification of qualifications i.e., of the connection which is a qualification of the bring ing about, denoted by the root in kṛtvā, which again, according to you, is the qualification of the yaga any such connection could not be enjoined by means of the Injunctive Affix Liñ.
tasmādanuṣṭheya eva vijñāyate /	Hence, though the Bhāvanā may be spoken of as connected, yet, inasmuch as the activity of the human agent should depend upon an Injunction, he would take that Bha vanā to be as good as nonexistent.
yadi tarhyanuṣṭheyatvena saṃbandhaḥ upapannaḥ kathamuttarayā'nuṣṭheyatvopāttayaiva saha saṃbadhyate /	down a new Action, it is quite possible for this Action to be laid down in a qualified form in the way shown in the construction put forward and as such the sentence having a single predicate, there would be no syntactical split involved.

In reply, the Bhashya says dvavētävarthan kṛtvetyesha çabdah çaknoti vaditum, abhinirvrttim purvakalatañca the word krtva is capable of signifying both accomplishment and sequence the qualification of a qualification can not be enjoined only in that case where that qualification, forming part of the Material, is not recognised as part of the Action itself.
yathā śoṣamānayeti pramāṇāntaraprāptepyānayatau raktośvaśvodyamāno na raktāśvaśabdābhyāmivābhihito vākyabhedaṃ janayati /	between the Revati and the Väravantiya, it serves as a necessary quali fication of the action of accomplishment denoted by the root kr in krtva because mere accomplishment being a generic term, unless it were qualified, it could not be recognised as something to be brought about. Thus then, in accordance with the declaration mrshyāmahe havishā viçeshaṇam it must be admitted that the accomplishment denoted by kr in kṛtvā, which serves to qualify the Bhāvanā expressed in connection with the root yaji in yajeta, is itself qualified by the connection between the Revati and the Varavantiya.
tathā ''tra klāśabdopāttā nirvṛttiḥ pūrvakālatvaṃ ca iti /	For these reasons, we conclude that the sentence in question serves to specify the Rk Rovati and the Sama Vāravantiya in connection with the Bhavana expressed in yajeta, which is qualified by a certain relationship of that Rk and that Sama that has been duly accomplished as expressed by the word kṛtvā.
atha vā /	Objection Thus too, there are many objects of the Injunctionthe Revati verses, the Varavantiya, the relationship of these, the Sacrifice, and the desire for cattle.
tatraiva na vidhīyeta viśeṣaṇaviśeṣaṇam /	Reply This does not affect us because we have already explained that the multiplicity of objects spoken of does not bring about the multi plicity of the object of the Injunction.
yatra dravyāṅgabhūtaṃ tanna karmāṅgaṃ pratīyate	If, however, what you mean is the multiplicity of those that are en joined as fulfilling some useful purposes,then, we offer you the following reply Even though many such useful objects may be mentioned, yet there is only one that forms the object of the Injunction and this one object, in the case in question, is the qualified Bhavana connected with the sacrifice.
nanu revatyopi vidhīyantaiti /	Objection The Revati verses also are found to be enjoined in the sentence in question over and above the said Bhavana.
yadi śrutamātrānupātyevānekārthatvaṃ bhavettata eṣa parihāraḥ syāt / ete ta sarve vidhīyamānatvātprayojanabhūtā,stasmādanekārthatvamastyeveti /	Your reply would be all right, if the said multiplicity of objects depended only upon that which is directly mentioned in the case in question, however, we find that all of the objectsRevati, etc.are distinctly enjoined as useful and as such there can be no doubt as to the said multiplicity. H Reply All that happens to be predicated is not spoken of as artha meaning or object of the Injunction that alone is spoken of as the ob ject which is connected with the principal Injunction and there can be no doubt that there is only one such object in the sentence in question.
vidheyamātramapyatra nārtha ityabhidhīyate /	This is what is meant by the Bhashyanahyatrānēkasya proyojanatvēnābhi prētasyanēkam padam vidhayakam.

Thus then, we conclude that the real object of the sentence being one only, there is no syntactical split while we have shown the many splits that are consequent upon the taking of the sentence as the Injunction of an accessory detail for the previous Agnishtut sacrifice.
phaloddeśena karmavidhānādityevaṃ manyamāno vadati /	Though this argument admits of the Action mentioned by the sentence in question being distinct from the previous Agnishtut, yet, inasmuch it makes the sentence lay down the Result as connected with the Action, yet it is opposed to our own view and hence we shall refute it.
atha revatoṣu kṛtena vāravantoyena paśukāmo yajeteti / stotradvāreṇa yāgamāghanatvopapatteḥ karatoyeṣā /	The argument may be thus explained The text in question may be construed thusRēvatīshu Vārvantiyam agni shtoma sama krtvā ētasyañgena yajeta Having sung the Varavantiya in the Revati verses, one should perform this sacrifice, as subsidiary to the previous Agnishtut. Objection Athaivamucyêta Revatishu krtena väravantiyena paçu kāmo yajēta.
atha vetyaṃbhūtanaṇānenaivetthaṃbhūtena paśukāmo yajeteti /	Though this view has been already dealt with, yet it is brought for ward again by the Bhashya, with a view to show another discrepancy in it.

In this case, we find that the Injunctive affix in the Yajeta of the sentence in question would serve to enjoin what is in close proximity with it • viz., the A sacrifice but being taken up by something else i.e., the qualification, it would not lay down the original appearance of that Action and as for the qualified character of the sacrifice, this would be based upon the Injunction. That is to say, inasmuch as the affix would enjoin the sacrifice with reference to the Result, it would not have to be removed from its legitimate sphere and as not pointing to the appearance of a of any Action, it could not lay down any such appearance then as for the Injunction of many things, just as in the case of the sentence laying down the original appearance of a distinct Action, such Injunction of many things is said to be for the fou que p purpose Injunction of the Action so, too, would it be in the case of the sentence being the Injunction of the Result as in this case also what is actually of the said enjoined is the Action itself, with reference to the particular result.
dvāvetāvartho kṛtvetyeṣa śabdaḥ śaknoti vaditumiti /	As for the Instrumental ending in Vār vantiyēna, it actually denotes Instrumentality, inasmuch as the Vara vantiya is an Instrument that helps, through the Stotra, the performance of the sacrifice.
siddhāntavādī tvapūrvakarma vidhāvanekārthavidhānaṃ śakyaṃ nānyatreti manyamāna āha /	The Siddhanti, however, thinks that an Injunction of many things is possible only in the case of the sentence laying down a new Action, and not in any other case with this in view, he makes the following reply What we say is possible in our case, because there is a direct declara tion to the effect while, in your case, as there is no such direct declaration, it would be impossible to obtain the Revati verses by merely getting hold.
sati vacane matpaśce śakyaṃ bhavatpakṣe tvasati vāravantīyagrahaṇamātreṇa nabhyamānāsu revatīṣvaśakyamiti /	of the Varavantiya and as such, the said argument cannot help you.

In reply to this, the Siddhānti proceeds to show his own desirable con clusion that he draws from the Apparent Inconsistency of the said Injunc tion of many things If any such declaration as you bring forward becomes an established fact, then the fact of the sentence in question lay ing down a distinct Action, and not the mere accessory of the previous Agnishtut, becomes fully established.
siddhāntavāḍhī svābhipretāne kārthavidhyanyathānupapattiphalaṃ kathayati /	Objection Atha yagasambandhonuvādaḥ, prakaranēna cangāta. That is to say, the result following from the Accessory, what the sen tence does is to refer to the fact, pointed out by the context, of that being subsidiary to the sacrifice.
yadi baca naṃ siddhaṃ tarhi karmāntaram / na pūrvasyaivānito guṇavidhānamiti / nanu tato yajeneti yāgānuvādāditi /	It might be argued, against the Bhashya bringing forward this objec tion, that there is no difference between this objection and that brought forward with regard to the particular relationship of the Basis and the Based, that has been already refuted see Text, page . On the for in question, of But there is a distinct difference between the two cases. To the above objection, the Bhashya makes the following reply The Syntax is always more authoritative than the Context.
tataścoddiśyamānatvādeva phalapadaṃ na tena guṇena vā saṃbadhyataityanarthakameva syāt, saṃbadhyamānaṃ vā vākyaṃ bhindyāt /	The said relationship of the Basis and the Based could be accepted only when it is found to be pos sible, as being in keeping with the connection of the particular result but. Thus then, there being no incongruity, the sentence in question must be taken as laying down a distinct Action qualified by a particular Acces sory and a definite Result. Consequently the sentence in question must be taken as forming the injunction of an independent Action.
guṇaviśiṣṭakarma vidhāne vā pratyabhijāyamānatvāde kāntena karmāntaratvam / na ca yatpapūrakāmo yajetetyaprāptatvādanuvādaḥ saṃbhavati /	Objection The qualified sacrifice being the object enjoined, how could the Agnishṭomasama, which is an Action other than that sacrifice, be connected with the particular qualification in the shape of the Väravantiya as sung in connection with the Revati verses? Reply It is by direct assertion.
etena revatīvāravantoyavidhiṃ pratyasya nimittatvaṃ pratyuktam /	As shown before, the assertion meant here is the one whose existence is o cognized by means of indirect implication, in the form the connection of the Revati and the Vārav antiya is to be wrought out of the Agnishtomasama.
ataśca na vāravantīyaṃ kena cihnalavattareṇa pramāṇena revatībhiḥ saṃbaddhamiti viśeṣahānādiguṇaṃ bhavet / atha yāgasaṃbandhī 'nuvāda iti /	Though as a matter of fact, there exists no such particular sama named Agnishṭoma, out of which the Varavantiya might be wrought out, yet what is meant is that it is to be wrought out of the Yujnayajñîyasāma, which is men tioned in the context. Or, the expression out of the Agnishtomasama might mean that the Vāravantiya would exist in the midst of the effects of the Stotra the Agnishtoma, as serving the purpose of accomplishing it. Sutra Because of the mention of human effort in connection with the Saubhara, there must be a distinct desirable result connected with the Nidhana.

prakaraṇādvi vākyaṃ balavattaramiti/	Then again, with reference to the aforesaid Saubhara, we have the follow ing sentence Hishiti vrshtikāmāya nidhanam kuryat, ürgityannad yakāmāya, un iti svargakāmāya.

Though this question has nothing to do with the difference or non difference of Actions, yet it has been introduced here as in a way con nected with the subject.
tacca nāsti asaṃyukta prakaraṇāditi va cyati /	Or, it may be that, like the difference and non difference of Actions, the difference and nondifference of the resultant Apurva also forms the subjectmatter of the Adhyaya.
saṃyuktaṃ caitatphalena / tasmādavirodhādguṇaphanna viśiṣṭa karmāntaravidhānam/	The hish and the rest mentioned in the latter sentence bring about distinct results of their own, because they are laid down over again, because the distinct mention of the result in the latter sentence could be justified only if these results were distinct and because this interpretation makes possible the acquisition of many more desirable results.
tadvikalya bhāvārthādhikaraṇanyāyena pratyayasaṃnikarṣeṇa yāgaphanta saṃbandhāvagamānnirākaroti /	sentence in question would serve the purpose of restricting the Nidhanas because these being directly laid down in other Vedic texts as the Nidhanas to be employed, they can not rightly be set aside on the strength of any such implied restrictions.
aya punarviśiṣṭe yāge vidhīyamāne kriyāntarasyāgniṭomasāno viśeṣaṇena kathaṃ saṃbandha iti /	As a matter of fact, in all cases, restriction, as serving the sole purpose of setting aside something, is highly objectionable.
vacanāditi / pragukta nyāye nātideśikaṃ vacanaṃ draṣṭavyam/	But when all other objects are indirectly im plied, then it is possible for the one that is directly laid down to set aside those in the case in question, however, the use of the hish and the rest is not implied indirectly and hence the injunction of any one of them cannot set aside the rest.
na kiṃ cidagniṣṭomākhyaṃ sāmāvasthitaṃ vi dyate yasya vāravantīyaṃ kāryāpannamiti kalpate /	Because we find that they are all directly laid down by the text that lays down the Saubhara and under the circumstances, it is scarcely right to take any one of them as set ting aside the rest, on the mere ground of a repetition actuated by an Injunction specially when this latter admits of another explanation.
tena prākṛtayadvitīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda / jaya jīyakāryāpattyabhiprāyeṇoktam /	In accordance with our theory, however, the use of hish and the rest having the capability of bringing about distinct results of their own, would be more desirable, for the agent, than those that have been men tioned as forming part of the Saubhara and thereby helping in the accomplishment of the sacrifice and on the ground of this greater desirability the former would very rightly set aside all the latter.
atha vāgniṣṭomasāmna iti stotrasyaiva kārye tādarthena varttivyataityarthaḥ /	A The sentence in question would serve a useful purpose, only if it laid down the relationship causal between the Rain, etc., and the hish, etc., which is not laid down in any other sentence.
tasmātmameṣu karmayuktaṃ phalaṃ syāditi siddham	In the Veda, which consists of Injunctions, we always want a lot of desirable results, because that makes it easier for the Injunctions to urge the human agents to action.
punarvidhāna sāmarthyātsvārthatvācca phalaśruteḥ /	Sutra Inasmuch as those mentioned in the sentence Priprem in question are exactly the same as those mentioned before, the mention of the Results would refer to the Saubhara and the repetition would serve the purpose of restricting the Nidhanas.
sarvasya coktakāmatvāttasminkāmaśrutiḥ syānnidhanārthā punaḥ śrutiḥ	The hish cannot be connected with the Result, because that would make the mention of the nidhana wholly redundant while if the nidhana be taken as connected with the Saubhara, the Result could be taken as qualifying the Saubhara.
doṣāvṛṣṭiṃ kuryāttāṃ ca nidhanabhūteneti vākyabhedaḥ, tadasaṃbandhe cānarthakyama asmatyate na kiṃcidanarthakaṃ, sarvasya saubharamya va canāntarairuktavṛṣṭyādi kāmatvena tatpadānāṃ ca prāptatvāvīṣādisaṃbandhamātre vidhīyamāne vākyabhedābhāvaḥ /	That is to say, if we were to take the sentence as one should bring about rain by means of the hish, and by that as a nidhana of the Sau bhara, there would be a syntactical split for if the hish were not con nected with the Saubhara, then the sentence would be wholly redundant. In accordance with our theory, there is nothing without some use and out of the things spoken of in the sentence in question, the Saubhara, as bringing about Rain, etc., mentioned in another sentence, has already been laid down elsewhere, as also the Results themselves and hence all that the sentence has got to lay down is the relationship between the hish, etc., and the Saubhara and as such there is no syntactical split.
na ca vacanamanarthakaṃ nidhanaviśeṣaniyamārthatvāt /	Nor is the sentence altogether useless, as it serves the purpose of restricting the particular nidhanas.

yathā cārthāḍhāttipyamāṇaṃ śrautena nivarttyate tathā parokṣavṛtyāpīti /	And just as that which is implied is set aside by that which is directly mentioned, so is also that which is indirect ly indicated.

If the sentence had laid down the part of some other song, then the part of the Saubhara would be set aside by that as a matter of fact, however, the restriction of the nidhana only serves to preclude certain letters of the stobha the sāma. And as such there is no anomaly of the preclusion of that which has been directly laid down.
tasmānni ghananiyamārthā punaḥ śrutiriti /	P For these reasons, we conclude that the repetition of the Results in the sentence in question serves to restrict the nidhanas.
evaṃ tu vyākhyāyamāne'sti kiṃ cidvācyam /	As for the form of the Doubt itself, there can be no such doubt be cause the construction of the sentence in question is wholly different from that on which the abovementioned Doubt has been based because in the sentence hishiti vṛshṭikāmāya nidhanam , hish cannot be taken along with nidhanam, because of the intervention, between them, of the word vrshṭikāmāya, as it would be very undesirable to take the sentence as hish is the nidhana,etc. This is the case of the above representation of Purvapaksha.
hīṣiti nidhanamiti vyavahitakalpanādoṣāda niṣṭaḥ saṃbandhaḥ / tathottarapakṣe 'pi /	So also in the case of the above representation of the Siddhanta, if the sentence be taken as laying down the hish with reference to the nidhana as qualified by desire for rain,then, inasmuch as it would contain a reference to a qualified object, there would be a distinct syntac tical split.
nidhane hoṣvidhānaṃ cedṛṣṭikāmaviśeṣite /	If it be taken as laying down the hish with reference to the nidhana only not qualified by desire for rain , then the mention of the Result would be wholly useless.
viśiṣṭārthānuvādatvādvākyabhedaḥ sphuṭo bhavet	For the above reasons, we must explain the Adhikarava as follows The hish being taken with the word vrshtikāmāya, there arises a doubt as to whether the sentence points to its connection with the Result or with the Means.
vṛṣṭikāmapadenaiva saṃbandhe sati saṃśayaḥ / phalena sādhaneneti vākya sāmarthyavīśraṇāt	That is to say, the sentence being taken as hīshiti vrshṭikāmāya, there arises a doubt as to whether the hish is related directly to the Result, or to a particular Means in the shape of the Saubhara as qualified by that Result? In fact, it is this construction of the sentence that has been shown in the Bhashya, by means of the sentenceshishiti nidhanamiti, etat phalam_ bhavatiti.
phalasaṃbandhapace tu na prayogavacanaḥ samartha ityarthavattā /	The sentencevrshtikāmāyeti säubharaviçeshanam Bhashya means that the Saubhara not being mentioned by name in the sentence be qualified by the Result therein mentioned. The assertionna hisha sambandhat means that the hish has no connection with the form of the result.
anyathā'nena saubharaṃ prakaraṇāvagatamapi vṛṣṭisādhanaśaktiyuktaṃ lakṣyeta /	No such collective Injunction, how ever, is capable of expressing the independent relationship of the hish with the particular Result and as such, in giving expression to this rela tionship, the sentence would be serving a distinctly useful purpose.
na ca tadāśrayaṇe kiṃ citprayojanamasti /	And certainly there can be no ground for having recourse to such an indirect Indication so long as the want is found to be supplied by means of direct Assertion.

The Siddhanta, in that case, would be represented as follows The previous sentence having spoken of a certain Result as following from the Saubhara as a whole, what the sentence in question does is to restrict the particular nidhanas of the Saubhara with reference to each one of the results mentioned and thus the mention of the results in the previous latter sentence is a reference to the very same results mentioned in the sentence. in question are distinctly recognised as being the same as those mentioned previously in connection with the Saubhara as a whole, we can never believe them to be distinct results following from the particular Ni dhanas.
kimarthā tu prāptasya punaḥ śrutirityata āha nidhanārthā punaḥ atiriti /	To the questionWhy then should there be a repetition?the answer isNidhanārthā punaḥçrutih the repetition is for the purpose of restricting the Nidhanas.
kasmātpunaḥ śrutyupāttena phalenaiva hīṣādayona saṃbadhyante /	Question Why should not the Hish, etc., be taken as connected with the Results mentioned in the same sentence with themselves ? Answer Just as in the previous Adhikarana IIii the Väravatiya was found not to obtain its desired substrate in the Sacrifice,so, in the case in question also, the Hish, etc., do not obtain their proper receptacle in the Results.
tatra ucyate /	That is to say, if we take the sentence as meaning that one should accomplish the particular result by means of the Hish, we are at once led to look for the substrate, resting upon which the Hish would accomplish that Result.
yathaiva vāravantoyaṃ neṣṭamāśrayamāptavat /	What the Hish can accomplish, by pervading over it, is the Nidhana but that does not form the subject of the Context and as such, it could not be the required substrate of the Hish, except on the authority of the syntax of the sentence in question.
phale tathaiva hoṣādi nāpnotyāśrayamocitam	And thus, the sentence itself serving the purpose of pointing out the relationship of the Hish with the result as its substrate, there would be a distinct syn tactical split.
na tāvatsaubharāvayavena nidhanena sādhitena prakaraṇanabhyasaubharaṃ sādhitaṃ bhavati avayavasya saubharatvenāpratītaḥ /	That is to say, as a matter of fact, the accomplishment of the Nidhana, which is a part of the Saubhara, does not accomplish the Saubhara itself that forms the subject of the Context because the part is not known as the Saubhara, and we have already shown above that the Saubhara would be taken as the substrate of the Hish, in whatever way it could be found to be capable of being such a substrate.

That is to say, as for the Hymns, inasmuch as they are never found in any other place, and are something superphysical, it is only right that they are never in serted in the midst of the sacrifice as a matter of fact, we have never found them occupying any other place and so long as their position is not as certained, their true form cannot be ascertained, nor ran they be connected with any result and if they existed anywhere else.

Objection As the word is one and the same, the word Hish that would be used in the case in question would be the same as that em ployed in ordinary parlance and as such to whatsoever the Hish may be cognised as pertaining, it would always occupy the same posi tion. Reply This cannot be because, even though the word be one only, it has a diversity of potencies, as with reference to the purpose served by it and hence the position that the word occupies at one time, could not be the same at another time, when the purpose served by it would be wholly different. That is to say, the mere fact of the word being one does not lead to the conclusion that the position in which it has been found to be effective, in one place, would be its position in all cases for certainly the position occupied by Devadatta while taking his food is not the same as that occupied by him when fighting as the particular position that a thing would occupy depends upon the purpose to be served, and not upon the form of the thing itself and the form remains always the same, what ever the position may be.

ananya viṣayatvena sthānamukthyādiṣu sthitam /	Reply It is not so because before the particular position of the Hish has been duly ascertained, the Saubhara cannot be laid down as accomplished by it and then, what you say would involve a mutual inter dependence the position of the Hish being ascertained by the fact of its helping in the accomplishment of the Saubhara, and this latter fact being based upon that position of the Hish.

tatra kāryāntarasthānaṃ na syātkāryāntareṣvapi	In the case in question, however, w find none of these reasons applying to the case of Hish, etc., and hence there is nothing to set aside the idea obtained through the ordinary method of comprehen sion.

The syntactical split that had been urged against us, would have been possible, if we admitted of a relationship of the Nidhana with the Hish,etc. or if we took the Nidhana as directly qualifying the Saubhara. As a matter of fact, however, we do none of these as we hold the relationship to exist between the Hish and the word vrshtikama and the fact of the Nidhana being the qualification of Saubhara, we deduce from the Context and certainly the peculiarities deduced from the Context do not cause a syntactical split.

For the sake of this question, we have got to consider the following question Is the Rathantara related to the sacrifice in its entirety i.e., is the Rathantara the only Sama to be used at it? or is it related by mere existence i.e., the Rathantara is one of the many used in the sacrifice ? And this leads us to yet another questionIs the Rathantara ac cepted as qualified by the Sacrifice, or the Sacrifice as qualified by the Ruthantara? Objection Inasmuch as the presence of the word yadi distinctly points out the Rathantara as a conditional motive, and as that forms the subject of the proposition, there could be no relation of the quali fication between the Sacrifice and the Rathantara. ma nepālako Reply The Rathantara could be taken as a conditional motive, only if it had been mentioned elsewhere, in the form that it is cognised as having in the case in question.
tatmiḍyarthamapyetaccintanīyam, kiṃ ṛtuviśiṣṭaṃ rathaṃtaramuta rathaṃtara viśiṣṭaḥ kraturihāśrīyate /	The conclusion that would suggest itself at the first sight, in connec tion with the above questions, would be as follows The action mentioned in the sentence in question is none other than the Jyotishṭoma itself because the presence of the Rathantara Sama, as also that of the Brhat.
nanu ca yadiśabdopabandhādiha nimittaṃ pratīyate tasya coddiśyamānatvāt viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyabhāvo nāvakalpetaṃ /	Sama, is mentioned by another sentence because the word yadi distinctly points to the conditional character, which depends upon the pre he vious mention of that which is laid down as the condition because the particular precedence of the vessel is included in the collective sentence laying down the whole procedure of the Action collectively because the Accessory mentioned in the sentence is not set aside by any other Acces sory mentioned more authoritatively elsewhere specially so, in accord.
aprātipakṣe tu bajāvidhānamāpadyate /	The Action mentioned in the sentence in question is a distinct Action because a compound is possible, only when the words compounded have .

Therefore we must take the compound as expressing the fact of the Rathantara being the only Sama connected with the particular sacrifice and inasmuch as we do not find either the Jyotishtoma, or any other sacrifice, connected with that Sama only, the presence of the mere Rathantara could not be the condition of any such sacrifice. Thus then, having to renounce all notion of condition, we find the word Rathantara āmā to be inexplicable and from this apparent inconsistency of the word, we come to take it as laying down an alto gether distinct Action, at which the Rathantara would be the only Samã employed.

And the mere existence of the Rathantara can not be a qualification as it does not extend over the whole of the sacrifice and not being a qualification, of being compounded and without the C cannot have the capability, there can be no compound but as a matter of fact, we find the Samasa actually present in the case in question consequently the Action mentioned in the sen tence is not recognised as being the same as the one mentioned before. Question Wherefore should we not take the Jyotishtoma itself, as having, in one alternative case, the Rathantara Sama only? Answer It cannot be taken in this way because such an assump tion would be direct contradiction of the Injunction of other Samas mentioned in connection with the Hymns directly laid down with regard to the Jyotishtoma.
evaṃ siddhāntaṃ prāptaṃ tuśahena vyāvartya satraḥ pūrvapakṣaḥ parigṛhyate karmāntara mi ti	When, however, the sentence is taken as laying down a distinct Sacrifice, it would directly lay down the Rathantara as related to that Sacrifice and as such in this case the Ruthantura would be more authoritative than the other Samas, which are all mentioned along with the original Injunction and so in this case.

evaṃ cānyapadārthavidhānāttatpradhāno bahubrohiranugrahoṣyate/	Thus too, the word Rathantarasāma being taken as referring to something distinct from that which is denoted by the words Rathan tura and sama themselves, the presence of the Bahuvrihi compound would become justified as the predominant factor in that compound is always something apart from that denoted by the component words.
a nyathā hyupamarjanaparatvaṃ lohitoṣṇīṣādivākyavaḍhagatyā pariṭhahota / yadi ca grahāgratāvidhānena mahatadakaṃ vākyaṃ tatastaccāpi rathantaravidhānaṃ cānekatvāḍha pūrva bhāvanā vidhinaiva nistoryate /	Otherwise i.e., if the Rathantara be taken as the qualification of the previous sacrifice the compound in question would have to be taken as pertaining to the subordinate element as the qualifying ad junct always occupies the subordinate position in a Bahuvrihi com pound just as in the case of the compound lohitoshnishaḥ in the sentence lohitoshnishā rtvijaḥ pracaranti, where all the other factors being found to have been previously mentioned, the sentence is taken as laying down only the redness of the turban. If again, the word Rathantarasāmā be construed along with the sentence that lays down the Precedence of the particular vessels, then, there would be two diverse Injunctions, that of the Rathantara and that of the Precedence and hence they could be accom plished through the Injunction of an altogether fresh Bhāvanā of a distinct Sacrifice.
somaḥ syāditi cānantaryāt tatkarttavyataiva vijñāyate, rathantaramāmatvakarttavyatā ta vyavahita kampanayaiva syāt / somaśabdena tu ca prakṛtiliṅgena jyotiṣṭomaprakṛtirevārya bhaviṣyati/	The expression somaḥ syat, through the extreme proximity of the two words, would directly point to the fact of the Soma being something to be brought about while the accomplishment of the fact of the Sacrifice having the Rathantara sāma, could, at best, be assumed only indirectly. And in accordance with our view, all that the word somaḥ would do would be to point out that the new Sacrifice laid down in the sentence in question is only a modification of the Jyotishtoma specially as the word somaḥ distinctly points to the pri mary original of the Sacrifice in question. Hence we conclude that the sentence in question is the Injunction of a distinct Action.

vyatyayena saṃbandhaḥ, kāmapraveḍhane ca niṅicchāṃ pratyāyayatīti siddhānta vivaraṇam / tatraiṣa vākyārtho bhavati /	With a view to the fact of completing a certain factor viz., that which forms the denotation of the Bahuvrihi compound by supplying its deficiencies being more reasonable than its rejection, the Bhashya addsatha va yadi iccheta,etc. if one desires,etc. because, the element of Desire is always implied by the fact of the Action being something to be performed, the supplying of this element in the sen tence in question must be accepted as authoritative, and not a mere gratuitous assumption.

tatra momaḥ syāditi heto liṅ, gṛhṇīyāditi vidhāveva tenaitaduktaṃ bhavati /	And though in this case the word grhniyat is deprived of its direct injunctiveness, yet, being taken as serving the purpose of denoting desire, it would, in reality, come to serve the pur pose of the Injunctive also inasmuch as one always does what he desires. CPoplane Or, it may be that the Injunctive in grhniyat lays down the prece dence of the particular vessel, as desired by the agent.

C The various alternative theories liere put forward are summed up in the following verse The rejection of the conditional yadi the supplying of the element of Desire the inverting of the construction of the two parts of the sentence and the taking of the Injunctive Affix as denoting the causal relationship.

yattu viśeṣaṇābhāvāt sāmāntara sāpakṣaviśeṣaṇatvāddā rathantarasāmeti samāso nāvakalpataiti /	Objection Inasmuch as the Rathantara sama does not serve to need of other Samas, the compound Rathantarasama is altogether impossible. Reply That which applies to a thing only partially is also found to be accepted as qualifying it by its mere existence and not by differentiating it from others and in the case in question, that is held to be the con dition which appears as the qualified at the time that the compound is broken up i.e., the compound is broken up as yatsambandhi Rathantara sama sah, the qualified in this case is the Soma sacrifice, and there is nothing objectionable in the fact of this sacrifice forming the condi tion.
yadi hi rathantara nityaṃ jyotiṣṭome 'nyasahitaṃ vā syāttato na vyavacchindyādapi, yatastvarathantaropi jyotiṣṭomaprayogostyeva tatastadvyavacchedamukhenāsti viśeṣaṇaphalam /	K That is to say, if it were such that one Rathantara existed in the Jyotishtoma always, and that always in the company of another sama, then it might not have served to differentiate it as a matter of fact, how ever, we find the Jyotishtoma being performed even without the Rathan tara and hence the presence of Rathantara can very well serve the purposes of a qualification differentiating this performance of the Jyotishtoma from that in which the Rathantara is not used.
yadā yadi rantatharaṃ sāmaivāmya bhavatīti, tatra kortha evaśabdasya tadvi rathaṃtaraṃ yadyapi sarvadā māma tathāpi yadā tau na bhavati tadā taṃ prati sāmakāryāmattvāḍha sāmaveti, sattāpace rathaṃtaraṃ sāmeti vacyate /	Or, the word eva might be inserted after sama, the clause being explained as yadi Rathantaram samaivasya bha vati and in this case the force of the word eva may be explained in the following manner Though the Rathantara is always sama, yet when it is not employed in a certain sacrifice, then, so far as that sacrifice is concerned, not helping it in the manner of a sāma, it is as good as notsama while when the Rathantara does exist in a sacrifice, then it is spoken of as sama for the character of sama meant in the clause in question must be taken as depending upon its presence, or otherwise, in the sacrifice otherwise, if the mere form of the Rathantara, independently by itself, were meant, then the use of the word sāma again in the word Rathan tarasama would be a useless repetition.
na ca rathantarasya māpenatvaṃ jyotiṣṭome, yena samāso na syāt /	Nor, so far as the Jyotishṭoma is concerned, is the Rathantara depen dent upon other samas and as such there would be nothing incongruous in the compound in question.
dvandvanirdiṣṭeṣu hyekastotraviṣayeṣu caitat bhavati /	Because such dependence is found in cases where many sāmas are mentioned by means of a single Dvandva compound as appertaining to a single Hymn.

Or, it may be that, inasmuch as the word sāma is a mere repeti tion, it is to be taken as indicating the Hymn accomplished by means of the sama and hence the compound indicates the Stotra Hymn that is brought about by the Rathantara and as such there is no dependence upon other Hymns.
athavā buhadrathaṃtarayoravāntaraprakaraṇāḍhavāntara kāryayogācca virodhinoḥ sparddhamānayoryathāvasthitānuvāda sāpyātmāmāntarā eyanapekṣya parasparāvaccheṭenaiva viśeṣaṇatvamiddhiḥ /	Or again, it may be that, inasmuch as the Brhat and the Rathantara are spoken of in the same subContext, and are endowed with secondary functions, they are opposed to each other and as such, vying with each other, inasmuch as both have the same character of being references to the existing state of things, they serve the purpose, independently of all other Samas, of precluding each other from being employed at the Joyotish toma, and thereby attaining to the character of a qualification. And in this way there is nothing incongruous in taking the Sacrifice qualified by the Rathantara as the condition of the particular precedence of certain vessels.
atha vā'stu rathantaraṃ kratuviśiṣṭaṃ nimitta miti /	Or, lastly, we can admit the Rathantara itself, as qualified by the Sacri fice, to be the condition laid down.

ṣaṣyantatvācca kraturviśeṣapāmeva samāsābhivyaṅagya viśeṣyatvabhāvāttathā vivakṣiṣyate /	And this would be the sense desired to be conveyed, because of the impossibility of the sacrifice having the character of the Qualified, as pointed out by the compound at first sight.
yadyapica kratvantareṣvapi vastusvarūpeṇa rathaṃtaramasti tathāpyatra tāvadvidyate tāvanmātreṇa ca viśeṣaṇatvopapattiḥ /	Though, as a matter of fact, the Rathantara is present, in its natural form, in other sacrifices also, yet the mere fact of its presence in the Jyotishtoma would be enough to point it out as its qualification.
svavākye cāmādhāraṇatvaṃ viśeṣaṇakāraṇaṃ na vastunavaṇaṃ, mā bhūnnīlamutpalaṃ devadattasya gaurityevamādīnāṃ viśeṣaṇatvocchedaḥ	Because, as a rule, for one thing to be recognised, in a sentence, as the qualification of another, all that is necessary is that, in that particular sentence it should be mentioned as a property peculiar to that object, and not that it should always belong to that object alone for if it were so, then, blue could not be cognised as the lotus, or possessed by Devadatta as qualifying the Cow as throughout the world, the Cow is not the object qualifying possessed by Devadatta and so too the property blue does not belong to the lotus alone so that, according to you, these two could not be poken of as qualifications.
yaḍhi ca vastuta evāmādhāraṇatvaṃ bhavennaiva śabdena viśeṣaṇa pāḍhīyeta/ na hyatra viśeṣāphalamasti agniruṇaiti /	On the other hand, if the recognition of one thing as the qualifica tion of another depended upon the fact of its really belonging to that object alone, then such a relationship would never be sought to be ex pressed in words for certainly there is no use of mentioning such a qualification as that the Fire is hot.
tasmādavaśyaṃ vākyagatamevāmādhāra pātvamā śrayitavyam /	Therefore all that we should accept as the means of such recognition is the fact of the property being men tioned, in that sentence, as belonging to that object alone.
asti cātrāpi ta ta jyotiṣṭomagatasyaiva rathaṃtarasya nimittatveneṣṭatvāt	As a matter of fact, we find, even in ordinary experience, the conditional character belonging to objects, present, past and future and as such the fact of the Rathantara being sung at midday, while the vessels are held in the morning, cannot be effectively urged against the said conditional character of the Rathantara.
tadvaśena prayogakauśanāgyāmādimiddheḥ /	known as such, it could very well serve as the condition for the particular order of precedence in the holding of the vessels in the morning.

As for the last argument of the Purvapaksha, based upon the similarity of the Rathantara, etc., with the Jagatsāma which is not present at the Jyotishtoma it is not quite proper because in such super physical matters, an inference from similar instances can have no autho rity and because the case of the Jagatsama is not quite similar to those of the Rathantara and the rest the former being as incapable of being included in the Jyotishțoma, as the injunction of the First day of the month as qualified by duality and plurality.

Does it serve to lay down the inserting of the Barhaspatya, etc., as due to conditioned by the connection of the Aveshtias form ing part of the Rajasuyawith the various castes,a connection that has already been laid down in the previous sentence? Or, does it lay down a distinct performance of the Avēshți, in connection with the Brahmana, etc., not mentioned before ? This leads us to the further question viz. B.
kiṃ rājasvaye 'dhikārastrayāṇāmapi varṇānāmuta kṣatriyasyaiveti /	Are all the three castes entitled to the performance of the Rājasūya, or the Kshatriya only ? C. there could be no doubt as to the sentences in question mentioning the connection of the castes only by way of pointing out the conditions for the inserting of the Barhaspatya and the rest.

pṛthagvā rājanyenaiva phalārthinā prayujyate na varṇāntarasaṃbandhaḥ /	And even if the Aveshti be performed apart from the Rajasūya, it would be performed by the Kshatriya only, when desiring the particular result of obtaining Food and as such there would be no connection with the other two castes.
tadyathā 'dhyayanādhānayonnijatatraivarṇika kartṛkatvāttadadhīna sidvonāṃ karmaṇāmathiṃmātrasaṃvandhāvagamepi satyapaṣṭadraviṣayatvamevāvatiṣṭhate / yathā cācaiva khārājyakāmāviśeṣepi rājakartakatva vaśena bhoktṛviśeṣo bhaviṣyati /	As for instance, the Action of studying the Veda and the laying of Sacrificial Fire being known as to be performed by the three higher castes only, even though the sacrifices depending upon these two Actions may be found connected with any and every agent that may be desirous of obtaining the results following from those sacrifices, yet they come to be finally recognised as to be performed only by the nonÇüdra castes and as in the case of the Rajasuya itself, even though all men may be equally desirous of the Kingdom of Heaven, yet on account of the Action being specified for the Raja only, it is the Rajā alone who could be the acquirer of that result by the performance of the Rajasiya.
tasmādrājasūyādhikāreṇevaibhava vacanaiḥ prāptiriti dvāveva pacau	Thus then there are only two alternative theories to be considered The Aveshti as connected with the three castes is laid down in the sentence laying down the Rajasuya, and it is laid down by the latter sentences.
kartā rājyasya rājeti sarvalokeṣu gīyate /	And to the performance of Rajasuya, all the three castes are entitled, as shown by the word Raja, which signifies one who performs the functions of a king. Because all through the world, it is only one performing the kingly functions that is spoken of as Raja.
mahāviṣayataivaṃ ca śāstrasyāpi bhaviṣyati	And it is thus alone that the text in question can have an extended application.
rājasūyādhikāraśrutiśvānalpaviṣayatvena svarasāt pravartamānā na nivatitā bhaviṣyati / tasmādrājyaṃ kurvantaḥ sarvatraivarṇikā rājānastaca rājyaṃ janapadaparipālanaṃ nāma sarvalokaprasiddhama /	That is to say, when it is possible for the word Raja to be taken both ways i.e., as signifying the Kshattriya, and as signifying one who performs the kingly functions, it is far more advisable to accept the sig nification of all the three castes because this interpretation alone would be compatible with the mention in the subsequent sentences of the conditions yadi Brāhmaṇaḥ, etc., and with the Context,etc. and also because this interpretation would not curtail the scope of the declaration of all the three castes being entitled to the performance of the Rajasuya. For these reasons it must be admitted that persons of all the three Rājās and these func castes, performing the functions of a king, are tions are well known to consist in the protection of the people and the removal, from among them, of all troublous factors.
āryāvarttavāsina iti śāstrasthā vā tannimittatvādityasya pradarśanārtham /	The Bhashya speaks of the word Rajā being used in the above sense by the people of Aryavarta North India and this is meant to show the authoritative character of the signification, in accordance with the Sutra Iiii.
rājñaḥ karma rājyamityetadabhiyuktā upadiśantītyetad bruvatā nanu rā jagandasyaiva prakṛtibhūtasya svātantrāmabhyupagataṃ bhavati /	That is to say, the said declaration makes the signification of the word Rajya de pendent upon that of the word Raja, which is the word appearing in the text in question and hence what the declaration does is to seek to ex plain the wordRajyanot in the textby the help of thatRājā which occurs in the text and consequently the word Rajā being inde pendent, it could not be explained as Rajyakarta.
tathā ci naivauda meghisaṃbandhādudameghaḥ prasidhyati / svatantreṇodameghena sa eva tvanugamyate	Because the word Udamegha is not comprehended by being explained as related as father to Audameghi in fact it is the word Audameghi that is comprehended by the help of Udamegha, which itself is independent.
rājā nirjñāta eveha svātantryeṇa ciraṃtanaiḥ / tadyogāt kalpitaṃ rājyamasmākaṃ tu viparyayaḥ	And so the word Raja cannot be rightly comprehended by the help of the word Rajya. Reply Though the people of old comprehended the word Rajā by itself, and deduced from that the meaning of the word Rajya”, yet for us, people of the present day, it is quite the other way.
naiṣa doṣaḥ /	sacrificial animal is tethered to it.

paraḥ punaryaiaugika grahaṇamātropakārakamiti pradarśayati prakaraṇavaśādyadiśabdasamabhivyācārācceti / na karmāntara vidhāyiṣyata iti prayogāntarābhiprāyeṇa /	But inasmuch as, in accordance with other laws and regulations, the word Rajā is found to have its ends fulfilled among the three higher castes only, the Cudra becomes naturally precluded by the fact of his being devoid of Vedic study,etc. There is, however, no such ground of precluding any other caste and hence we conclude that all the three higher castes are entitled to the performance of the Rājasuya. Objection As a matter of fact, the kingly functions have been specially laid down for the Kshattriya and hence it is only by an unlaw ful assumption of others functions that the Brahmana and the Vaiçya perform those functions and as such these latter cannot be rightly called Rajas.
athavā /	Reply This argument does not touch our position because by the mere fact of having performed the kingly functions, these two castes also acquire the title of Raja? and this performing of the kingly func tions is all that is required by the RajasuyaInjunction.
yadā yadi śānti bhuñjītetantravārtike / tyādayo vacanaprakārā gṛhyante tadai kenaiva vākyena brāhmaṇa saṃbadho bāīspratyābhighāraṇaṃ ca na śakyate kartumiti mukhyameva karmāntaratvam /	Objection in the Bhashya We find the word Raja applied even to such Kshattriyas as do not perform the kingly functions of protecting the people,etc. This argument has been brought forward here as forming the basis of the Siddhanta and hence we proceed to refute it but before doing that we must find out what it means. It means simply this It has been said above, in connection with the words varhih, ajyam and the like, that when even a single part of the word has been found to sig nify the Class, we cannot assume any other signification for it and so in the case in question also, when, even in the case of a single person, the word Raja has been found to signify the Kshattriyaclass, we cannot very well assume any other meaning for it.
evaṃ tāvadubhayaprasiddhiṃ pramāṇīkṛtyoktamidāna tu rājyarahite prayogaḥ pramāṇameva na bhavatīti prastūyate	The reply to this is that in the case of the word Raja, we find the literal signification that afforded by its constituent parts to be more reasonable than any other that is dependent upon mere popular con vention. This is what is meant by the Bhashya, when it sayspraka ranavaçāt, yadiçabdasamabhivyāḥārācca.

dātriyavacana evāyaṃ rājaśabdo na yaugikaḥ, sahi rājyayogāḍhā bhavedvātvarthānumāre dīptiyogādvā ubhayathāpi cānupapannaḥ /	This means that the sentence would not lay down the performance of the Aveshti apart from that of the Rajasuya the word karmäntaram being taken indirectly in the sense of prayogāntaram or it may mean that if we admit of the same construction as that shown above, in the case of the sentence yadi çalim bhunjita dadhyupasincet, then the same sentence could not serve to lay down both the connection of the Brahmana, as well as the insertion of the Barhaspatya and in this case the word kar mantaram of the Bhashya would be taken directly in the sense of another Action, and not indirectly as in the former case.
tadracitarūḍhiśabdadarśanāṭe kadeśasthāpi rūḍhiravayavaprasiddhiṃ bādhate /	accordance with the Sutru Iiii while the clausesamīcīnatara “ācāro bhavati refers to the usage of the word.

nanu cāyuktakasya paraprayuktakāritvāhatvija iva yajamānatvaṃ na rājatvaṃ bhaviṣyati	je Objection As for the Representative of the king, inasmuch as he performs those functions by being appointed to it by another person, the word Raja is not applied to him just as the word sacrificer yajamana is not applied to the sacrificial Priests.
abhiṣekopi dharmajñaiḥ kṣatriyasyaiva padyate /	Answer That would not be possible because, the Anointment also is declared by the knowers of Law to belong to the Kshattriya only, just like the word Raja and hence that too could not belong to a non Kshattriya.
mahāsau rājaśabdena tena nākṣatriye mataḥ	Hence we conclude that the word Raja is generally accepted as denoting the caste ‘Kshattriya? Nor can it be urged that the Injunction Rājānamabhishincēta serves to point out a name to be applied in the future its meaning being that one should anoint that person who would, after that Anointment, be known as Rājā.
nityāḥ śabdārthasaṃbandhā yathāvasthitagāminaḥ / nāśrayantyadhruvaṃ hetuṃ svacchanda parikalpitam	And further, the Word, its Meaning, and the Relation between them, all three, being eternal, pertain to the natural state of things existing and as such they do not base themselves upon impermanent causes, gra tuitously assumed by us for the occasion. For instance, in the case in ques tion, the word Rājā being eternal, its signification too must be one that is permanent, because there can be no real relationship between the Per manent and the Impermanent.
sā ca nityatā vastvapekṣayā vā vidhyapekṣayā vā nirupyate	This permanence is cognised as depend ing either upon the nature of things or upon an expressed Vedic Injunc tion.

The above argument also serves to preclude the possibility of the signi fication of the word Raja being based upon the performing of kingly functions because those functions also are found to be connected with the Kshattriya caste, only after they have been laid down as pertaining to the Raja, just like the said Anointment. And, as a matter of fact, we have found the word Raja applied to one who has neither been anointed, nor performs the functions of the king, and not to such persons as have been anointed and perform those functions, but are not Kshattriyas this latter usage is met with among the Dravidas. Hence too we conclude that persons of all the three castes cannot be called Raja Further, all grammarians explain the word Rajanya as Rajnah apatyam, deriving it from the basic noun Rajan and yet the word Rajanya has no other meaning b the Kshattriya caste.
rājanyaḥ atriye ruḍho rājānaḥ sarvaeva cet /	That is to say, just as the offspring of the crow is called the crow, so the offspring of the Raja would be Rājā.

prakṛtau tadapatye ca jāniśabdasya tucyatā / tena rājaiva sarvatra rājanyo 'pyabhidhīyatām	Reply This does not quité affect our position because though as a matter of fact the word Rajanya is synonymous with Raja, yet it is only by way of showing g its grammatical formation that it is explained as Rajñaḥ apatyam and the said explanation is possible only when both refer to the same caste, as the offspring always belongs to the same caste as the Father.
paryāya eva hi rājaśabdasya rājanyaśabdo'nena prakāraṇānvākhyāyate sa tvekajātiviṣayatve sati tathānvākhyātuṃ yujyate nānyathā naiva tāvadubhau śabda/	Objection The word Rajanya would denote the Kshattriya caste, on account of the sutra when the patronymic is affixed to Rajan it de notes the class Vārtika on Panini Sutra IVi, and not on account of the word being explained as Rajñaḥ apatyam and consequently the denotation of the word Rajanya could not affect that of the word Raja, Reply It is not so because inasmuch as the Vârtika you quote does not mention any particular class, it might be taken as referring to the com prehensive class Man and so, according to this Vārtika, the word Raj anya would come to denote that class Man and not the Kshattriya .
svātantryeṇa prasidhyataḥ / lṛptāyāmakaśakta/ hi dvitīyā yaugiko varam	Reply True, we meet with such differentiated duties but that is in accordance with the maxim of the Brāhmaṇaparivrājaka that is to say, the word Raja refers to the particular Rajanya who has undergone anointment just as the word Parivrājaka is applied particular Brahmana who has gone through the rites of Renunciation.
ācārayorasaṃbandhe saṃdeha sati nirṇayaḥ / sannibandhanayā mṛtyā banīyastvādavāpyate	And when it comes to the acceptance of one of the two words having its independent signification fixed by convention, it is distinctly more reasonable that it should be accepted with regard to the word Rājā” because, as a rule, whenever there is a doubt caused by a disagreement between usages, a satisfactory conclusion is always arrived at by the help of the stronger authority of a properly compiled Smrti.
tasmādiyameva vacanavyaktī rājñaḥ karma rājyamiti sakalaśca rājetiśabdo rājyenupraviṣṭa iti sa yaugiko yuktaḥ na su rājyaśabdo rājanyanusyūtaḥ sakanna ityayaugikatvam /	For these reasons, we must take the Bhashya on the point as declaring that it is the formation of the word Rajya that should be evolved out of the word Raja, and not that of the latter from the former. For if the formation of the word Raja were evolved out of the word Rajya, then there should be certain definite gramma tical rules laying down either the elision of the letter ya in Rajya, or the modification of the word Rajya into Rajā. For these reasons, the construction must be explained as Rajñaḥ karma Rajyam the function of the Raja is Rajya, and not as Rajyasya karta Raja the performer of the kingly functions is Raja Nor can the latter explanation be accepted on the mere ground of the apparent inconsistency of the use of the word among the people of Āryā varta because such usage of the word Rajā is known in another part of the country.
satyameva rājyaśabdasya yaugikatvamupapadyate	Objection True in this way the word Rajya does come to have its denotation fixed by that of its constituent part Raja.
asādhāraṇabhāvena sarvatreṣṭaṃ viśeṣaṇam / tena tasyaiva karmeti cintitādi na guhyate ṛtumadhyaprayogo hi svāra rājyenaiva pūritaḥ /	But in that case, the word Raja could never be applied to a nonl Kshattriya who may perform the functions of the king and hence it cannot be denied that there would be an incompatibility of the usage common among the people of Aryāvarta as the said explanation of the word Rājā would at once mark down as incongruous such uses of the word as na Çudrarajye nivasēt one should not live in a country where a Cudra is the rājā.” A say, the word Rajya is Reply Yogat lokaḥ prayunkte that is to explained as formed by its connection with the Rājā, and then the pres ence of the Rajya kingly functions in the Brahmana, etc., makes the word Raja indirectly applicable to these latter castes also.
virodhitvātprasajyete vikalpāvṛttikalpane /	Question In that case, you admit the fact of the word Raja being taken as formed by its connection with Rajya kingly func tions.
bādhastenābhyupetavyo vyavasthāyāṃ tu naiva te na ca rājasūyeneti sāmānyaśabdaḥ paurṇamāmīśabdavat, prakṛta samudāya viśiṣṭa samudāyivacanatvāta ata eva tatkṛtamapi na daurbalyaṃ labhate /	Answer That does not touch our position because we hold the word Raja to be only indirectly or figuratively applicable to the Brahmana,etc. It would be only if we made the word directly applicable to these, that the Adhikarana would be wholly reversed. While as for the indirect application, inasmuch as it is always set aside by the direct application, even if it were admitted, it could not set aside the Siddhanta. Hence it must be admitted that the word Raja is applied to the Brāhmaṇa, etc., only in consideration of the fact of these latter being the proxy of the Kshattriya, in the performance of his legitimate functions of protecting the people.
na ca tāvatā kaścidatiśayo'sti /	less authoritative than Smrti vide Adh.
nanu caitayeti śrutyaiva pratyakṣavacanādasti viśeṣaḥ /	I, Pāda iii, the said usage must be explained as being figurative or indirect.
yadi vā 'thaiṣa jyotirityādivat prastūyamānaṃ brūyāt, pratyayasaṃnnikarṣāttatrāpi yajiśabdagu hī taivāveṣṭirannādyena saṃbadhyeta /	It has been urged above that as the word Audamegha gives us an idea of its basic noun Udamegha, so the word Rajya could afford an idea of its basic word Rājā! But this Indirect Inference is set aside by the Direct Perception of the usage common among the Draviḍas. If the performer of kingly functions were to be spoken of as Rājā, then, in that case, it would be necessary for us to infer the existence, firstly, of the said relationship of Action and its Performer, and, secondly, of certain grammatical rules definitely laying down the presence of that relation ship in the case in question.
etāvacca rājasūyayajāvapyastītya viśedvitīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Thus then, the greater authoritativeness of the grammatical smrtis distinctly points to the fact that it is the word Raja and not Rajya that has an independent denotation of its own fixed solely by convention. .

According to us, on the other hand, no special importance is attached to usage and as such the fact of our theory not being in keeping with the usage of Aryavarta does not in any way tar nish it. But, as a matter of fact, even in Aryavarta we do find the presence of kingly functions whenever the word Raja is used and thus there can be nothing incongruons in our theory as all that it does is to explain what is used, and leave off the explanation of the fact of the word not being used by the people of Aryavarta with reference to those Kshuttriyas that are devoid of kingly functions.
ayameva viśeṣo yadekatra bahūnāṃ grahaṇamaparatra cārapānām /	And it has been shown above, under Sutra Iiii, that in matters of merely verbal usage, which pertains to ordinary perceptible things, a certain authoritativeness attaches also to the inhabitants of countries lying on the frontiers of Āryāvarta.

yadi caikāntikamatrākamantaratvaṃ sthāna tata evama cyeta, karmāntaramapi cainadini darśitam /	As a matter of fact, there is nothing incompatible in the fact of a single Action of the Avështi bringing about many results because distinct results might very well follow from its distinct performances. As for Repetition, it will be shown later on, that it is objectionable only when the Results are spoken of as following conjointly from the same Action.
tataśca viṣayāntaratvādeva svārājyānnādyayoravirodhaḥ /	Objection Inasmuch as the pronoun ētaya points directly to the Avështi mentioned in the Context, there is a distinct difference between this and the Rajasuya Injunction which refers to it only indirectly.
karmāntaratvepi ca bāīspatyādiniṅgadarśanātprakṛtāveṣṭiprakṛtitvameva pratipattavyam /	As a matter of fact, however, we find that even in the sentence ētaya, etc., it is on account of the proximity of the root yaji to the Injunctive Affix in yājayēta that the Resultfoodis men tioned in connection with the Aveshti, which is indicated by that root ‘yaji and this indication of the Aveshti is found to be done also by the root yaji occurring in the RajasuyaInjunction and so even this does.

Reply But this is just the same as what we have pointed out beforeviz., that the only difference lies in the fact of the one referring to many more sacrifices than the other but at the time of the actual referring to the Aveshti in particular, both are equally authoritative. Further, if there were an absolute nondifference between the Avështi of the Rajasuya, and the Aveshti performed by the Brahmana,etc. which latter is the one referred to by the sentence ‘ētayā, etc.then what you say might have been all right z.e., then alone could the mention of the two Results be said to be incompatible.
ādhāne sarvvaśeṣatvāt	Sutra The laying of fire forms an object of Injunction, because it does not form an integral part of all sacrifices.

If it be found, in some way or other, to have been mentioned, then even in the absence of the conditional if, the sentence would be taken as laying down the condition for the particular season to be chosen and in that case, the construction of the sentence in question being, yad Brāhmaṇa ādadhīta tad vasante the vasanta and the Brāhmaṇa would come to restrict one another .e., the Spring would be the time for the Brāhmaṇa, and the Brahmana would be the performer in the Spring time.
na tāvannityamarthasya prāpakatvamasti, upāyāntareṇāpi pratimahādinā puruṣāntarāhitānāmātmanepadenāniyatāno sunnabhatvāt /	If, on the other hand, the sentences be taken, not as Injunctions of the Laying, but as simply laying down conditions, then we would have the reverse of all these three advan tages. The Laying of Fire having been implied by an Injunction of a sacri S fice in general as svargakāmo yayēta, or laid down by a general Injunc tion such as Ya evamvidvānagninādhattē, etc., its mention over again in the sentences in question must be taken as mentioning the various castes as conditions for the particular times of the Laying.
pratyaścavacane satyanyathānupapattipaśśe satyarthāpattinabhyaśrutyaparigrahācca /	The argument of the Siddhanta may be thus summed up So long as we have a direct Injunction, we cannot very well admit of an implied or inferred one and hence either the mention of the purpose to be served, or that of the existing state of things, can never serve as Injunctions.
ya evaṃ vidyānityapi varttamānāpadeśaḥ pratyacāya liṅi brāhmaṇāḍhivākyeṣu upannabhyamānāyāṃ na vidhiśakti slabhate / asti caitadupanyāsasya pratyakṣavidhiyuktodakopasarjanādisaṃbhāra vidhānāthatvamityaprāptameva brāhmaṇādiviśiṣṭamādhānaṃ vidhīyataiti /	When, however, the neces sary Injunction is found to be directly asserted by a Vedic text, there is no Inconsistency which could lead us to assume an unheardof text as containing the required injunction,the only ground for assuming such texts being some sort of an Apparent Inconsistency. Then, as for the men tion of the existing state of things, in the sentence ya ēvamvidvānagnīnā dhatte, etc., so long as we find a direct Injunction of the Laying of Fire, in the shape of the sentences in questionväsante Brāhmaṇognīnādadhita, etc., etc.any mere description of the existing state of things can never acquire an Injunctive potency to the same effect specially as this latter has got to serve a distinct purpose of laying down all such details as the fetching of the water, etc., mentioned in the original direct Injunction. For these reasons, it must be admitted that the sentences in question serve to lay down the hitherto unmentioned Laying of Fire as performed by the Brahmana,etc. The sentences in question serve to mention the Brāhmaṇa, etc., as condi tions for the previously mentioned Laying of Fire. Why so? Because the words are similar to conditional phrases.
kiṃ nimitta sāpyamiti yadiśabdādyanupabandhābhiprāyam / brāhmaṇādīnāṃ ca vasantādividhibhiḥ samuccāraṇamiti parapadasaṃbandha saṃcāritāyāṃ vidhiśaktī nimittaphalatvās	Question On what is the similarity based? That is to say, when there are no such conditional words as yadi and the like, how can the a wo sentence be said to be similar to conditional clauses ? ga Answer The ground of similarity is the utterance of the words Brah mana, etc., along long with the words Vasanta,etc. That is to say, the injunc tive potency of the sentence having been used up in laying down the relationship between other words i.e., Brāhmaṇa, etc., and Vasanta, etc., the sentence could not serve to enjoin the Laying of Fire, and as such it could only be taken as laying down certain conditionsin the shape of the said relationship between the Brahmana and Vasanta. That is to say, the sentence could be taken as laying down the Laying of Fire as qualified by Vasanta.

evaṃ prāpte brūmaḥ na nvādhānamagnīnāmabhyupāya iti /	That is to say, inas much as the relationship between the Brahmana and the Laying of Fire is already known, it could not form the object of any fresh Injunction.

Answer It has been mentioned by the texts speaking of certain desir able results to be obtained. ya evam, etc., that directly lays down the Laying of Fire.

Then again, if the sentence were taken as laying down the relationship of the Brahmana with both the Vasanta and the Laying of Fire, then there would be a syntactical split. To the above arguments we make the following reply As in the previous Adhikarana, so bere also, the sentences in question serve to lay down the Laying of Fire.
api ca /	Because such Laying is not subsidiary to the actions.
bhavedatrārthabhede nānāvākyatvaṃ yadyādhānaṃ vidhīyata / tat brāhāṇādisaṃyuktairvicitamiti guṇārthameveha punaḥ śrūyate/ kuto nu khalu nirṇayaḥ kataradanayorutpattivākyamiti /	That is to say, if the Laying of Fire were subsidiary to the Actions, then there could be a question as to whether it is implied by these or not. Question But what, if it be so i.e., even if the Laying be not a part of the Actions, how does that affect the p present question? The sense of this is that even the Action could also imply, through Inconsistency, the subsidiary Luying of its own subsidiary The reply to this is that what is done by Apparent Inconsistency is that the texts, laying down the fulfilment of certain desirable ends by means of cer tain actions, indicate the Fires, and not the Laying of these. Because it is possible for the Fire to be obtained by asking for it from another Agni hotri, therefore there is no Apparent Inconsistency in the Fire that would necessarily point to the Laying.
taducyate	Apparent Fire.
yadi hote he api vākye vidhātṛṇotāṃ tataḥ samānaviṣaye matī spardheyānāṃ katara dvidhattāmiti / atra punarekaṃ vi dhāyakamekaṃ stāvakam /	Question But Laying is the means of having the sacrificial Fires. We take the mere material form of the object, only in cases where that . object is capable of being brought about by the ordinary ways of the world, as for instance, in the case of such objects as a piece of Cloth, a Cart, and the like the sacrificial Fires, however, are not capable of being brought by means such worldly ways and hence it is absolutely necessary for the means of their accomplishment to be mentioned or implied in the Veda itself and as there is no such means save the Lay ing, this also is implied by the Fires i.e., by the Apparent Inconsistency of the Fires, which would not be possible without the Laying.
na ca stāvakena brāhmaṇādi saṃyukta mya vidhāyakatvaṃ nivāryate tadānuguṇyā, dyadi tu ya evaṃ vidvānityapi vidhisarūpaṃ syāttato vicitasya punarvidhānānupapatterasmatpa caṃ nirundhyāt, liṅā tu vihitasya saṃbandhisaṃbhāravidhiprarocanārthaṃ tu stutisahinasya punaḥ śravaṇamitya vidhāyakam/	Though we shall show later on that even in the other case, it was not possible for the Laying to have been laid down by those other texts. If, on the other hand, the sentence in question be taken as the direct Injunction of Laying, then it at once sets aside the possibility of all other means of obtaining the Fire specially as, in that case, the Atmanēpada affix in adadhita distinctly shows that the result of the Laying would accrue to him alone who actually does the Laying consequently the accomplishment of the Sacrificial Fires, which is the result of the Lay ing, would not belong to one who does not himself perform the Laying for whom the Fire, even if obtained from one who has duly laid it, would be as nonsacrificial as ever. While if the Injunction of the Laying he taken to be implied in the texts speaking of certain results as following from the Agnihotra, etc., then, inasmuch as such an inferred Injunctive sentence would contain neither the Parasmaipada nor the Atmanepada affix, the result of the Laying would accrue equally to one who has and who has not performed it and hence, there would be nothing to set aside the emyloying of the other meansbegging, etc.of obtaining the Sacri ficial Fires.
liṅā ca sāvadvātvarthavidhānaṃ svapadenopāttatvāt śrautaṃ prāśastyaṃ punarvākye na, tataścānumāniko vidhiriti viprakuṣyate /	It has been explained above that all Restric tive Injunctions serve to lay down something not mentioned before because so long as there is a direct Injunction, there can be no assumption of an implied one. And as a matter of fact, we have direct Declarations of the Laying of Fire and hence it is not possible for any to be merely indirectly assumed or inferred.
nanvidamapi vākyamiti brāhmaṇādipadārthāparityāgābhiprāyam /	This Laying, however, we find to be laid down in the sentence Brāhmano vasantē,etc. and as such the mention of it again in the sentence ya evam,etc. is only for the purpose of laying down the preparatory details.
siddhāntavādīmantravārtika / badati ādhānaṃ tāvat śrutyā śeṣaṃ vākyena nāma bhavatu khapadopāttāyāḥ stuterabhāvāt /	Question But how is it ascertained which of the two sentences vasante,etc. and ya ēvam, etc.is the real originative Injunction of the Laying ? Answer In the sentence vasante, etc., we find the Injunction directly expressed by the word ādadhita , while in the case of the other sentence ya evam, etc.it would be got at, very indirectly, from out of the Arthavada therein containedya ēvam....
evaṃ dviṣantaṃ bhrātṛvyamavattiṃ mahatadtya/dipadasaṃbandhanaiva stutiriti vākyam / kartṛkāla viśiṣṭa pradhā nādhānavidhānācca vākyabhedaparicārāt siddhaṃ prāpakatvam	That is to say, if both sentences were equally injunctive of Laying, then the object of both being the same, there could have been some rival ry between them, as to which one should be accepted as the true Injunction. As it is, however, one sentencevasante, etc.is injunctive, while the otherya ēvam, etc.is only eulogistic. And certainly a mere eulogistic sentence cannot set aside the Injunctiveness of the sentence vasante, etc., because an eulogy is a helper and not an obstructor of Injunctions. If, on the other hand, the sentence ya ēvam.
dācayaṇayajñādīnāṃ tu yāgasāmānādhikaraṇyātpūrvayāge cāprayukta tvā dātma rūpāvacchinnayāgāntarapratipādanamaviruddham / na ca kaściddaṣyādibhiḥ tulya evaṃsaṃjño guṇāḥ prasidvastasmādbhāvārthādhikaraṇanyāyena phale yogavidhānāt yāgāntaram	had the character of the Injunction, then, inasmuch as the enjoining of what has already been enjoined once would be most improbable, our theory might have been thwarted. As a matter of fact, however, the case is that the Laying having been enjoined by means of the Injunctive affix in ada dhīta, the other sentenceya ēvam, etc.speaks of it only for the purpose of eulogising the preparatory details connected with it and as such it can have no injunctive character. Then again, the injunction. of the Rootmeaning dhã in adadhīta by means of the Injunctive affix, occurring in the same word, is got at by direct denotation while it is only indirectly, through syntactical connection, that an eulogistic sentence could point to such an Injunction, which, in this case, can, at best, be only an assumed or inferred one and certainly an indirectly assumed In junction has its injunctiveness very much farther removed than that of one expressed directly.
phanjasyānupādeyatvānna brohibhiryajataityādivatkarmoddeśena vi dhiḥ saṃbhavatotyavaśyaṃ karma tatra vidhātavyam /	Even though the sentence be the injunction of Action, yet, that Action cannot be any other than the one laid down before,for rea sons shown under Sutra IIiii specially as the sentence is found to bring about an idea of the causal relationship between an Accessory Dakshayana and a Result acquiring of children just as in the case of the sentence dadhnendriyakamasya, etc., it must be admitted that the sacrifice referred to is the same that has been laid down before.
tataśca siddho bhedaḥ	Sutra Because the sentence is quite complete with the mention of the Result.
dadhyādivadevācāpi vaiyadhikaraṇyenaiva saṃbandhaḥ	And further, even if the Dakshāyaṇa, etc., be taken as coexten sive with sacrifice, then too, on account of their proximity to the Dadhi, etc., these sacrifices would be recognised as mere modifications of the DarçaPūrṇamāsa.
tasmāddarśapūrṇamāmayorevāvasthāntararūpāt vikārāt phalaṃ na karmāntarāt	Consequently, even in this case, what the sentence would do would be to lay down the Result following from a modification of the DarçaPūrnamāsa, and not from any other sacri fice wholly distinct from it. In this way, an utter disruption of the Context would also be avoided.
liṅgadarśanāca	Sutra The name Dakshayana is due to the peculi arity of the Accessory.
triṃśatpūraṇaṃ paurṇamāsyamāvāsyāsaṃkīrtanaṃ vā bhedaṃ bodhayati/	This Sutra meets the Purvapaksha argument of Sutra .
na hi darśapūrṇamāsika striṃśadvarṣapacaḥ karmāntareṇa parayituṃ śakyate/ na ca niyamasyātideśo, yena karmāntarasyevaitat pañcadaśavarṣapakṣavidhānaṃ syānna ca ḍhākṣiṇāyanayājitvena nimittena darśa pūrṇamāsayoreva paccadaśavarṣapaca upajāyate saṃbandhābhāvāt /	The Name serves the purpose of distinguishing an Action from others, only when it occurs in the originative Injunction of that Action, and is not recognized to have a connection with any previous Action. In the case in question, however, we find that the name Dākshāyaṇa is not connected with any originative Injunction specially as in this case we do not find the sentence introduced by any word expressing the beginning of a new action, as we do in the sentence atha esha jyotih,etc. And then, inasmuch as the Name is quite capable of being explained as mentioning an Accessory of the previous Sacrifice, it cannot serve the purpose of distinguishing the Action. That the word Dakshayana deuotes a mere repetition of the previous sacrifice of the DarçaPurnamāsa is shown by the sense afforded by the com ponents of the word itself, as also by the abovequoted text that there are two Darças and two Paurnamāsas, in the Dakshāyaṇa.
ḍehi paurṇamasyauhe amāvāsye iti cāsyānupapattiḥ	Hence we conclude, from the Context, that the Result mentioned in the sentence in question follows from the Dakshayana as based upon the Darça Purnamāsa.
yadyapi karmeddeśena na phalaṃ vidhoyate tathāpi karmaphalasaṃvandhābhāvāḍhakarmāntaratā / yathaiva hi karmaṇaḥ phannamiti bhāvārthādhikaraṇe sādhitaṃ tathaivātulyatvāttu vākyayorityatra guṇaphanasaṃbandhāparyavasāyitvamapyuktamiti saṃdehe sati padāntarānugrahāthaṃ guṇādeva phalaṃ na karmaṇa iti siddham	The name Sakamprasthiya also means that the substance referred to by this word is offered prasthiyate along with sakam the smaller vessels, before the cutting up of the Sannayya cake and thus this name also is found to belong to a material only, in connection with the previous sacrifice and hence in this case also, there is nothing to oppose the recognition, in the sentences in question, of the Action that has been mentioned before. Sutra There is nothing peculiar in the completion of the sentence with the mere mention of the result. Though the sentence does not enjoin the Result in reference to the Action, yet, inasmuch as it does not speak of any connection between the Action and the Result, the Action herein mentioned cannot be following from the Action has been established under Sutra IIi et seq.so, exactly in the same manner, has it also been shown, under Sutra IIii, that there are certain sentences that serve the sole purpose of establishing the relationship between a Result and a certain Accessory of the previous sacrifice. And hence there being a doubt as to which of these two previous conclusions should be applied to the case in question, the presence of certain other words such as those cited under Sutra distinctly point to the conclusion that in the present case, the Result is mentioned as following from the Accessory of the previous sacrifice and not from any distinct sacrifice.
katham /	Sutra It is a mere preparatory rite, as not occurring.
yadi tāvadānambhanirvāṇa prakṛtya śrūyeyāna tataḥ prakṛtapratyayānuvṛttireva prasajyeteti karmāntarāśaṅkā na syā, danāramyavāde tu sati śvetādiguṇasyopādeyatvātkadā ciddūrasthānuvādana guṇo vidhoyate kadā cidvā viparivṛttyabhāvātkamantaramiti jāyate saṃdehaḥ	If the Touching and the Preparing had been mentioned in reference to a previously mentioned sacrifice, then the idea of that sacrifice would be present when we came across the sentences in question and as such there could never be any ques tion of the sentence laying down a distinct sacrifice. While when they do not appear in reference to any such sacrifice, inasmuch as the accessories of Cveta, etc., are quite capable of forming the objects of Injunction, it might be that these might be taken as enjoined with reference to the Touching and the Preparing spoken of at a distance in the sentence laying down the DarçaPurṇamāsa or it might be that no idea of that previous sacrifice being present in the mind at the time, the sentence may be taken as laying down a distinct Action and thus the matter would be doubtful.
tannirākaraṇamapi ca prakaraṇabhāvāda sādhāraṇopacacaṇṇābhāvācca na prākṛtayonīkikavyāvṛttarūpayoḥ pratītirastītyevaṃ bhaviṣyati /	It is only when the sentence does not refer to any previous action that the Purvapaksha could have the slightest semblance of plausibility because, no other Touching and Preparing being. found in the same Context with the sentence in question, it could not but be taken as laying down certain accessories with reference to the original Touching and Preparing of the DarçaPurnamāsa. The Refutation of this Purvapaksha also would be possible only when the sentence in question is known as not occurring in reference to any previous sacrifice.
guṇavidhivi ṣayatvācāla bhanirvāpaiau guṇavidhiśabdenoktau /	The Touching and the Preparing have been spoken of in the Bhashya as gunavidhi, because they form the objects of the gunavidhi.
yathaivāyaneṣu guṇasaṃbandhapare vākye karmavidhiśabdābhāvāṭakamantaratvaṃ tathedāpi bhaviṣyatīti caśabdenānvādiṣyate/	Just as in the case of the Dakshayana it has been found in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa that, the sentence mentioning the connection of the Accessory, and thus there being no word injunctive of any Action, the sentence could not be taken as laying down a distinct Action, so would it also be in the case in question. This similaritybetween the two cases is what is implied by the word ca in the Sutra. The Sutra mentions the word aprakaraṇē with a view to point out the exact object, with regard to which the sentence in question would lay down the Accessories.
atha vā yadyapyetāvan pūrvavaināṇyenāprakaraṇe śrūyate tathāpi karmaṇo vidhiśabdānavarodhādgārthaiva punaḥ śrutiriti darśapūrṇamāsayoḥ śakraṭaṃṣā sā śvetīkṛtyānavdhavyā nirvāpaśca caro kartavyaḥ caruparimito vā bhūtibrahmavarcamakāmayośca sarvebhyo darśapūrṇamāsāvityevaṃ prāptayoranuvāda, stathā vāyavyamiti sarvavanaspatīnāṃ vāyudevatātvāt kathaṃ ciḍhīṣāyā evānuvādaḥ /	Or it may mean that, though there is this difference between the sentence in questio. and that dealt with in the previous Adhikarana, that the present one does not appear in the Context of any particular Action, yet inasmuch as the connection of the original action DarçaPūrṇamāsa is not obstructed by the presence of the Injunction, in the sentence, of any other Action, the sentence must be taken as mentioning the original actions of Touching and Preparing, only with a view to lay down certain accessories in connection with them. Hence the sentence Cvetamalabhēta must be taken as enjoining that the Oartpole at the DarçaPurnamāsa should be touched after it has been made white and similarly the sentence carum nirvapet should be taken as enjoining that the preparing or holding, at the same DurçaPurnamāsa, is to be of the Caru boiled rice, or that it is to be measured by the Rice. Then, as for the mention of the results of prosperity and Brahmic glory spoken of in the sentence as following from Touching and Preparing, it would be a mere reference to the same results following from the DarçaPurnamāsa, which is specially spoken of as accomplishing all desirable results. Then as for the word Vayavyam, that too could be taken as only referring to the eartpole of the DarçaPurnamāsa because the pole is made of the wood of a certain tree, and Vayu is the presiding Deity of all trees.
sauryamiti cāgneyasyaiva tejodevatyasāmānyādanavādastasmādbhuṇe vidhīyataiti	And as for the word Saurya, that would be a reference to the Agneya cake of the DarçaPurṇamāsa, because both Agni and Surya are the deities of Light. Touching and Preparing were wholly incapable of having the character of the enjoined, then alone could the sentences in As a matter of question be taken as laying down mere Accessories.
vāyatryapadaṃ pūrvavaḍhevopecya phalapadaparigraheṇa tāvat pratyavasthīyate / yadi hyālambhanirvāpāvanūdya śvetaca vidhīyate tataḥ phalapadamanarthakametra syāt/	For the present we lay aside the word Vayavya, and proceed to refute the aforesaid arguments, on the basis of the word express ing the result. If If the White and the Rice be taken as laid down with refer ence to previous Touching and Preparing, then the mention of the Results Prosperity and Brahmic glory would be wholly meaning less. For even if the mention of these were mere references to the all results following from the DarçaPurnamāsa, then too the parti cular results of Prosperity and Brahmic glory would be only two among the many alternative results and as such the mention of these as if they were the only results would not be quite compatible.
viśeṣaṇatve vākyabhedaḥ syāt	If again, these Results be taken as mentioned by way of qualifica tions, then there would be a syntactical split.
guṇaviśiṣṭālabhavidhāne tu na kaściddoṣaḥ / tenocyate karmaṇaḥ pratimūtvāditi /	of this relationship, t Whereas there is no objection to the view that the sentence lays down the Touching as qualified by white it is with a view to this that the Sutra saysbecause actions based upon Direct Vedic Declarations. That is to say, in the case in question, it is the Action that, being the object of Injunction, is based upon the authority of that Declaration and hence the Injunction of the mere Property of white would not have the authority of the Veda.
karmātra vidheyatvena śrutimūlaṃ na guṇaḥ, sa hyacodanāla cā eva syāt / atha vā yāvaduktameva syāt na yajimat /	Nor is that element so very necessary that without it nothing can be accomplished as it is quite possible for the Touching and the Preparing to bring about the Results, and thus serve as the Principal Actions. C as subsidiary to another, can never appear as a Principal Action, even when it is actually spoken of as such because the Principal or subsidiary character of an Action depends upon the Veda and there is nothing inherent in the Actions themselves that would mark them out as the one or the other.
kutaḥ ka rmāḥ śrutimūlatvāt	As for the word Vayavyam which might be urged as pointing.
yajatistu dravyaphalabhoktṛsaṃyogādeteṣāṃ karmasaṃbandhāt	to the fact of the white object being offered to the Deity Vayu, which offering would constitute a sucrifice, it could be explained away, as being a mere reference, on the ground that all substances are capable of being, in some way or other, related to certain deities even without their being actually offered to them.
yathā phalapaḍhaṃ prekṣya guṇapakṣo nirākṛtaḥ /	And as the sentence embodies a qualified Injunction, there would not be any very great trouble in taking the sentences thus. Or, the sentences might mean that the desirable results are ob tained as soon as the white object is touched for the sake of Vāyu, or when the boiled rice is prepared for the sake of the Sun.
devatāpadamālokya tathaivānambhamātratā	And cer tainly it is not in a sacrifice alone that anything can be done for the sake of certain Deities.
saumāraudramityukte vināpi yajatiśabdena pariśrayaṇa vidhipare vākye yajatinānudyamāne yajatimatkarmavidhāyitvamevamādīnāmityavagamyate /	Because there is no incompatibility in something being done for the sake of a certain Deity, whenever that happens to be enjoined for being done as such even if it be not a sacrifice. The sense of this is that, though it will be said later on that the sentences that do not appear in connection with any particular Action serve the purpose of mentioning some thing for the original Action of the Context,yet, this declaration is not one that has an absolute verbal authority as it is only based upon the fact of these factors mentioned in the sentences being otherwise in capable of serving any useful purpose, apart from the original action.
pūrvaṃ caitāvadeva vicāritaṃ kiṃ prakṛtānuvāditvamuta vidhāyakatvamiti / siddhe tu vidhāyakatve kimātmakaṃ tatkametyetadadhikaraṇādhīna me vaitadityapāna maktyam	Then if the Touching were meant to be specified in the sentence in question with the sole purpose of precluding the touching of the ordinary world,then, there being no other specify ing word, the specification would have to be done by the Injunctive affix tself and hence all that the word alabheta could mean would be that touching which has been laid down as something to be done and the potency of the Injunctive having been wholly spent up in this, any further injunction of the Accessory would be absolutely impossible.
sūtrakāreṇa ceda hetumātramu dvitīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Nor can the single injunctive word alabhëēta serve the twofold purpose of indicat ing the former Touching, and laying down the accessory white.

But this mere meaning lessness, without the action of any Context, etc., cannot lead us to accept only the Verdic Touching and Preparing as to be meant by the sentences in question.
padaṃ sūtrakāreṇa nopāttamidaṃ vṛttikāraṇetyetatpradarśanārthametadvayanti /	Sutra But the sacrifice is laid down because of the mention of the enjoyer of the Substance and the Result, which are related to some sort of an Action.

Inasmuch as, as a matter of fact, the Injunction in question depends upon each of the words contained in the sentence, it must be taken, in the case in question, as pertaining to the relationship of the substance, the Deity and the word vayavyam expressing that relationship.

Hence the sentence could not but be taken as meaning that the white substance should be offered to Vayu and from this we conclude that the sentence is the Injunction of a sacrifice in the shape of offering. Because the Injunction of Sacrifice will be defined later on as yajaticodana dravyadēvatakriy m samudayē kriyarthatvāt IVii.

Though the Purvapakshi has brought forward the objection of the highly complicated character of the theory of the sentence being a qualified Injunction, yet as it must have been carelessly brought. forward, and that too against an assumed adversary, we take no notice of it here because we do not hold to that theory what we hold is that the Injunction is of the Sacrifice only, there being mere references to Touching and Preparing. Sutra Also because we find texts indicating the same conclusion.

In fact, in the case of the sentence agni shomiyam paçumalabhēta, it is only by the above reason that the presence of sacrifice is admitted. ter or In the previous Adhikarana we considered the question as to whether the sentence is an Injunction or a mere reference to a previous Action while what we have considered in the present Adhikarana is the question having been established, what sort of Sacrifice is enjoined by it.

And against these people the following is urged A reason never establishes its conclusion until the form of this effect has been duly shown. And, as a matter of fact, we find the Sutra mentiouing only the reason, prāyadarçanāt.” Nor is the meaning of the Sutra or the Context, etc., capable of showing what special instance is meant to be dealt with, or what the question and conclusion are? Thus then the Sutra being altogether unintelligible, it devolves upon the commentators to try and remove this deficiency of the Sutra.
tathā ca dohanādisaṃskāra karmaprāyadanamupapadyate dṛṣṭārthatvaṃ ca gopranavana hetutvāt saṃyuktastvarthaśabdena tadarthaḥ śrutisaṃyogāt	Specially as the supplying of words, from outside, into the Sutra, has been bhibited, only with reference to such Sutras as are quite explicable wd the it and all that is meant by that prohibition is that, inasmuch as une sole motive of the author of the Sutra is to train the intellect of the pupil, only that much of extraneous matter should be assumed, without which the Sutra would be inexplicable, and all sorts of matter are not to be saddled on to it. And hence inasmuch as the subject, etc., of the Adhikarana have not been mentioned in the Sutra, the author of the Vrtti shows what they are.

Some people accept the word alabhēta as synonymous with sacrifice, on the strength of the foregoing Adhikarana while others.
cammupaddhātīti ca dvitīyānirdeśāt upadhānaṃ pratipattiḥ /	take it as merely implying the sacrifice and it is both these views that they bring forward in connection with the sentence in question also.
na cānyatrānupayuktasya pratipattiryuktā ityākāṅkṣite yo gyatvāt yāgopayogitvameva vijñāyate /	Close upon the sentence in question we have the sentence vatsa nikāntā hi paçavaḥ Animals love their young ones dearly and this could be taken as an Arthavada showing a reason for the previous Injunction, only when the preceding sentence vatsamālabhēta is taken as enjoining the touching by way of fondling it for the purpose of making the cow yield more milk .
vākyaśeṣe ca bṛhaspatiḥ śrayamāṇo yadi vidhyadeśena saṃvadhyate ānarthakyameva syāt / tasmādāgne prakṛtikaṃ bāīspatyacaruyāgaṃ nirvartya śeṣakāryāntarāṇyakṛtvā upadhātavyaśvarurityevaṃ prāptam /	If, on the other hand, the word alabhēta meant touching for the purpose of killing by way of offering to a Deity, the mention of the fact of the young being dearly loved by animals would be wholly irrelevant for in that case the purport of the two sentences would be this Because the calf is loved by its mother, therefore it should be touched for being killedcertainly not a very relevant proposi tion! In Sutra As connected with the word mentioning an Action, it must be taken as being for the sake of that Action special ly as such is the direct signification of the words of the text. The Adhikarana before last having dealt with the significations of the words alabhēta and nirvapēt as contained in the sentences gvetamā labhēta and sauryañcarunnirvapet,the last Adhikarana has dealt with the counterinstance of the first part of that Adhikaraṇa and the present Adhikarana proceeds to deal with the counterinstance of the second portion dealing with the Preparing in connection with the boiled rice.
evaṃ prāpte brūmaḥ carvādīnāṃ svabhāvena naidamarthyamavasthitam /	Nor is the case of this exactly similar to that dealt with in the foregoing Adhikarana as in this we have a further ground of doubt, in the shape of the mention of a Deity Brhaspati.
yathāpramāṇamevaiṣāṃ viniyogo 'vagamyate	As soon as the appearance of the Rice has been mentioned, we naturally seek for the use to which it could be put and we are met by the sentence yadēnam carum upadadhāti, which directly lays down the ft of the Rice helping towards the preparation of the altar for the reception of the Fire to be used at the sacrifice.
na ceyaṃ pratipattiriti prathamaṃ prayojanavattvānavagamāt / artha karmaṇyapi copadhānaṃ prati prādhānyamasti tenāsaṃskṛta stha na nirvarttayatīti dvitīyā nirdeśāvirodhaḥ	And the Rice thus could not have any connection with another Action, even if such an action were directly mentioned and hence it is all the more impossible for it to have anything to do with an Action that is not even mentioned but only indirectly implied. Nor can the keeping spoken of be said to have the character of the Pratipatti because we do not know of any use to which it could be put prior to the keeping. having its use clearly defined, it o Further, even in the case of an action which is performed with regard to an independent purpose, the Rice has a certain predomin ance over the keeping and hence as unless the Rice is purified by the said keeping, it cannot help in the preparation of the altar,there is nothing incompatible in the presence of the Accusative ending in • Carum .
novārasaṃbandhaḥ san bṛhaspatiścarāvanumātavyaḥ /	That is to say, the Deity Brhaspati, being mentioned in connec tion with the Nīvara in the Arthavāda passage, could be connected with the Rice, only by a highly complicated process.
tathā vākyaśeṣastho vidhyuddeśamanākājitadevatāsaṃbandhaṃ netavyaḥ	For these reasons, it is far more reasonable to take the Caru Rice as serving the purpose of being kept aside.
yeṣāṃ ca bāīspratyo bhavatīti carusāmānādhikarapayena taddhitena vākyaśeṣe devatāśrayaṇaṃ teṣāmapi prathamamupadhānārtha vidhyaddeśāt siddhenākāṅkṣitatvāddevatā vidhātumaśakyeti vartamānāpadeśānurodhena yādṛśaṃ vayamasya bāīspratyatvaṃ vartamānaṃ paṇyāmastādṛśamevaitat praśaṃsā kīrtitamityavagamāt ya eva śākhāntarīyasya vacanasya bṛcaspatervā etadannamityetasyārthaḥ sa eva bāīspatyo bhavatītyatyāpi taitirīyavacanasya niścīyate /	Some people bring forward the supplementary sentence Barhaspatyo bhavati, as containing the word Barhaspatyaḥ, which is coextensive with caruh, and which serves to point out, by means of the nominal affix, the Deity connected with the Caru Rice. But for these people also, it would be necessary to take the Injunction, in the very first instance, as pointing to the fact of the Caru being for the purpose of being kept and then as there would be no deficiency felt in the Injunction, for want of a Deity, it would not be possible for the sentence to lay down any Deity. Consequently, the present tense in the sentence Barhaspatyo bhavati would indicate that the character of being related to Brhaspati, that is attributed to the Caru in the sentence Brhaspaterva eladan nam yannīvārāḥ by way of eulogising it, is the same that we perceive as belonging to it, at the present time and thus the meaning of the sentence Brhaspatervā,etc. comes to be the same as that of the sentence Barhaspatyo bhavati though this latter occurs in the Taittiriya Text, while the former in the Madhyandiniya.
tasmā deṣopi na yajimaddacana iti yāvaduktatva siddhiḥ	For these reasons we conclude that the sentence in question lays down, not a sacrifice, but that alone which it distinctly mentionsviz., the keeping aside of the Caru.
na ca tvaṣṭurabhāvena pratyabhijñāyate ' saḥ / paryagnikṛtayogācca vākyabhedaḥ prasajyate na cāsau kālasya baktā yena paryagnikaraṇakāla evotsṛjatīti kalpyeta etenāvasthāvidvitīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	And further, inasmuch as the sentence in question does not contain any mention of Tvashṭā, the action mentioned therein cannot be recognised as the same as that mentioned in the previous sentence in which the word Tvashtra forms an important factor and if the action mentioned in the two sentences be taken as the same on the ground of both sentences laying down the patnīvata, then, on account of the sentence in question containing the mention of paryagnikarana also, there would be a syntactical split if it laid down the Patnivata also. That is to say, if in the sentence in question, both the words paryagnikṛtam and pātnivatam were mentioned as mere qualifica tions, as the two words tvashtra and pātnīvatam are in the pre vious sentence, then the action mentioned in the sentence in question.
dhiḥ pratyuktaḥ /	could be recognized as the same as that mentioned in the previous sentence.
codakenaiva tāvat paryagnikaraṇāvastha utsṛjyataiti prāpitam /	If again, the sentence be taken as laying down the giving away utsrjati with reference to the Patnivata, then, inasmuch as it is also found to mention the qualification of paryagnikrtam, there would be a syntactical split and it would be in an indirect way that the giving away would be connected with the paryagnikarana.
tammānna pūrvakarmaṇi kiṃ cidvidheyamasya vākyasyeti karmāntarameva dravyadevatā saṃyuktaṃ, devatāguṇasāmānyena ca pūrvaprakṛtika magniṣomoya prakṛtikameva vā vidhīyataiti prāpte 'bhighīyata	And further, as the giving away of the Patnīvata has already been men tioned in the previous originative Injunction, its repetition in the sentence in question would be useless if the Actions were the same. Nor is any useful purpose served, in the present instance, by the injunction of the Paryagnikarana in connection with the action in question because its existence in that Action is already indicated by its presence in the original Primary of that Action. Nor can we accept the sentence as containing an alternative injunction of the Action having Patnīvata for its Deity as the position of the Deity is already occupied by Tvashta mentioned in the originative Injunction. Nor can the difference of the two Actions be asserted on the mere ground of the repetition of the Paryagnikaraṇa, whose helpfulness in the original Action has been duly ascertained,as in the case of the Grha medhiya.
pātnovataśabdastāvat manovāyāmivāgniśabdaḥ satyapyubhayaviśiṣṭatve śaknoti prakṛtaṃ yāgaṃ vaktaṃ, paryagnikṛtamutsṛjanīti prakaraṇāt tasyaiva guṇavidhivijñāyate	Because the sentence in question mentions the Paryagníkaraṇa merely a as a subordinate factor. Nor can the word Paryagnikaraṇa “be taken as denoting the subsidiary procedure ending with the Paryagni karana and as such the mere mention of the Paryagnikṛtam could not serve to separate the part of the procedure ending with the Paryagnikaraṇa, from the subsidiary actions that come a after it. Nor again is the word Paryagnikrtam expressive of time and hence the sentence could not be taken to mean that the giving away is to be done at the time of the Paryagnikaraṇa. And there is no ground for taking the word Paryagnikrtam as indirectly indicative of the time specially when the direct signification of the word makes the sentence quite compatible and explicable.
tatakhaitāvantyevā syāṅgānītyavadhāraṇāt svarūpaprāptimā codakenāpi siddherutarāṅgāvacchedārthamevedaṃ vākyamiti phalena vya padapūtvāvaccheda iti / evaṃ ca sati yāgāntarāpūrvāntarānumānādikkeśo na bhavatīti /	The same arguments also serve to set aside the view that the sentence lays down the particular state of the giving away because the previous Injunction itself has laid down that the Pätnivata is to be given away when in the state of the Paryagni and so this could not be enjoined over again in the sentence in question. If it be urged that the sentence serves to preclude the condition subsequent to the Paryagni karana, then that would entail the three anomalies of rejecting the enjoined, accepting that which is not enjoined and so forth, which have been shown to attach to all Preclusive Injunctions. To the above, we make the following reply Inasmuch as the sacrifice mentioned in the sentence in question is actually recognized as the same as the one mentioned in the previous sentence, we cannot perceive any other sacrifice in it and what the sentence in question does is to lay down, with regard to the same sacrifice, all the subsidiary procedure ending with the Paryagnikarana.
na ca parapadasaṃbandhavidhānaviprakarṣaḥ /	Objection But we have shown above that none of the various ways of the injunction of accessory is possible in the sentence in question.
paryagnikaraṇānta viśiṣṭe tatmarge vidhīyamāne yadyapyutsargasvarūpaṃ prāptameva tathāpi saduddeśenāṅgakalāpa tantravārtika /	is quite capable of implying it especially as one cannot be spoken of as having finished the Paryagnikarana, until all that precedes it has also been done. Consequently the mention of the Paryagnikarana alone also implies all that precedes it. And then, the sentence laying down the performance of the Tvasṭra is found to stand in need of the mention of the method of procedure to be employed in regard to it and inasmuch as it would have no reason for going beyond the group of subsidiaries ending with the Paryagni karana the capability of whose usefulness has been perceived, it would not stand in need of all subsidiaries of the original Agnishomiya.
vidhānāinatyanta viprakarṣātma eva vidheyatvenoktaḥ /	And hence it is this separation or preclusion that is spoken of in the Sutra as the effect of the sentence hence the Sutrapurvatvādavac chedaḥ.
tvatpace tu dadhnendriya kāmasyetyādiṣviva dhātogatyantapārāyaṃ syā, tasmādapyakarmāntaratvam /	In accordance with your theory, on the other hand, the ot in utsrjati would come to denote something wholly distinct from itself, just as in the case of the sentence dadhnēndriyakāmasya juhuyāt as you would have to take utsrjati as laying down something different from giving away, its rightful denotation. And for this reason also, we should accept the action mentioned in the sentence in question to be the same as that mentioned in the previous sentence.
prakaraṇādapi ca paryagnikaraṇāntāṅgagrahaṇamiddheḥ patnīvatagrahaṇaṃ tyānuvāḍhatvāḍhatantramiti viśiṣṭānuvādaikadeśe vyapadeśo pānnambha parihāra, stasmādga, pavidhiriti siddham	Then again, inasmuch as the Context also favours the view taken of the subsidiaries ending with Paryagnikarana, no significance can be attached to the mention of the Patnīvata as this last word serves as a mere reference to description of what already exists and this explana acceptance of the mention of only a portion of the reference to a qualified object.
prakṛtādapi bhettṛtvaṃ nāmadheye vyavasthitam /	Sutra When the name appears by itself without any mention of the sacrificial material, it would be subservient to the Action.
kimutāprakṛtebhyo 'tra yatra naivāstyabhedaṣīḥ / na tannāmadheyaṃ prakṛtī kasya cit prasiddhaṃ yasya punaḥ śrutisāmarthyād dvirabhyāsaḥ kriyate /	The sentences in question enjoin two sacrifices. The arguments in support of this view are as follows It has been shown above under Nāmadhēya that the name of a sacrifice serves to distinguish it even from that sacrifice which may have been originally mentioned in the Context and hence it will distinguish actions all the more easily from those that are not mentioned in the same Context, with regard to which there can be no idea of identity. In the case in question we find that the names adabhya and Ançu are not known to belong to any sacrifice mentioned in the Context and hence the sentence cannot be taken as laying down a mere repetition of the same.
tasmādgṛhṇāticodanāsāmānyena jyotiṣṭomaprakṛtirekāhoyaṃ codyataiti manyāmahe /	Consequently we conclude that the sentence lays down the Ekaha sacrifice which forms part of the Jyotishṭoma this conclusion being pointed out by the similarity of the injunction of holding.
na va vatmānambhatulyatvam / ekatra yajateḥ pratyaścatvāt anyatra cāvyabhicāriṇyā saṃjñayā 'nyatve kalpite gṛhṇātinā samastajyotiṣṭomadharmaprāpterdravyadevatāsaṃbandhasiddhiḥ /	Nor is the case in question similar to that of the touching of the calf because in the first of the two sentences in question, we find the direct mention of the sacrifice, and in the second, we have a specific name, which serves to distinguish the Action so named from all other Actions and because the presence of the injunction of holding in the sentences transfers, to the actions herein mentioned, all the details of the Jyotishtoma and as such these actions become Deity,etc. which is not found in the case of the sentence labhēta.
ato yāgāntaratvami'ti prāpte 'bhidhīyate devatā tāvat dūrabhraṣṭaiva yadi gṛhyamāṇaṃ dravyaṃ tadapi na kena cidupāttam /	To the above we make the following reply In the case of sentences where we have only the Name and the holding mentioned as in the case in question, the chances of the mention of a sacrifice are very much less than in the case of the sentence vatsama labheta because the former is devoid even of the mention of a Material. That is to say, we find that, in the sentences in question, the mention of the Deity is a long way off and even the object that would form the objective of the mentioned holding is not mentioned.
na hi jātyā guṇena ca vinā dravyamupalacayituṃ śa kyam /	Because the substance cannot be pointed out except by a class or by a property.
na ca yāge'navadhārite jyotiṣṭomavadbhāvorita yena somagrahaṇametaditi vijñāyate /	And so long as it has not been ascertained that the actions mentioned in the sentences are sacrifices, there can be no idea as to the sacrifices being similar to the Jyotishtoma and as such Soma the material offered at the Jyotishtoma could not be recognized as the material to be held.
na ca gṛhṇātirjyotiṣṭomaṃ na vyabhicarati upādānamātravacanatvāt / na caite yāganāmanī yena taṃ bhindyātāṃ, grahaṇasāmānādhikaraṇyādvi tannāmatvamanayo, rivyataevāsmābhiratra grahaṇabhedaḥ /	And as for the verb grḥnäti, also, there is no reason to believe that it is always concomitant with the Jyotish toma because all that it expresses is mere holding and this action is present in all sacrifices. Nor are the names in questionAdabhya and dAnçuthe names of any sacrifices, whereby they could serve to distinguish these sacrifices. Because these words have been accepted as names, simply on the ground of their coextensiveness with holding and as for the difference of holding from the previous sacrifices, we also admit it but it does not follow from this that the sentence lays down a distinct Sacrifice. As a matter of fact, we have proved, under Sūtra IIii, that even when such sentences are accompanied by the mention of Deities and Materials, they cannot be taken as laying down sacrifices.
na ca tāvatā yāgāntaratvaṃ bhavati /	While in the case in question, we do not find even this mention of the Deity and the Material.
dravyadevatāsaṃyogepi caivaṃjātīyakānāṃ yajimāvaṃ nirākatam /	is established by means of the Jyotishtoma, with which it has the similarity of the presence of holding. As a matter of fact, however, we find that both the sentences in question occur again in connection with Jyotishṭoma, in the Taittiriya Rescension of the Text.
acodakāca saṃskārā itya, ca punastadapi na vidyate agnistu liṅdarśanāt kratuśabdaḥ pratīyeta	D As we do not find the sentence repeated again in the Con text, as we do in the case of the sentences dealt with in the foregoing Adhikarana, as no useful purpose would be served by the mere purification of Agni,we conclude, from the very fact of the presence of the name, tha the sentence lays down a distinct sacrifice and thus alone could we justify the subsequent mention of the Result, in the sentence Rdhnoti,etc. Nor can the result herein mentioned be said to follow from an Accessory because no substrate of any such Accessory is mentioned in the Context.
sampravārtika /	And then, we perceive that such distinctive marks as the Upasad, etc., which are the invariable accompaniments of the Soma sacrifice, are connected with the Action mentioned in the sentence in question.
agniṃ cinutaityatrāpi cedhaiva saṃdehaḥ yadā 'gnimagniṣṭomādi saṃstheryā gairanuyajatītyukte yadyagniryāga evamasāvanuyaṣṭuṃ śakyate /	So also, in the sentences athatognimagnishṭomenānuyajati, etc., we find that Agni is the name of a sacrifice to be performed because the sentence agnim yajati is precisely similar to the sentence samidho yajati, wherein it has been shown, under Sutra Iiv, that the wordsamidhaḥ is the name of a sacrifice and hence we come to take the sentence in question as laying down a sacrifice qualified by the name Agni, And this Agnisacrifice comes to be qualified by the sansthas of the Agnishtoma, which are found to be present in it. Then as for the words dviratra, etc., they could be taken as pointing out the alternatives of time.
tadyathā devadattamanugakatīti yadi devadattopi gachatyevamanugamanamavakalpate tathā 'nuyajanamapi /	In all cases we find that the order of sequence or precedence is laid down only among objects that are similar in forro and action for instance, in the sentence he follows after Devadat such following could be possible only when Devadatta also would be moving so in the case in question the performance of the Age quent to the Agnish toma would be possible only when the Agni would be similar in character to the Agnishtoma and as such the Agni could not but be a sacrifice, like the Agnishtoma.
tasmāt śrunānumitetikartavya nāṣat ṛtuvidhānametaditi paścime tu vyā'gniśemādibhyaḥ paścāt kiyamāṇoyaṃ tadaṅgameva bhavatīti phalaśrutirarthavādaḥ syāt /	Hence we conclude that e sentence in question lays down a sacrifice which has for its procedure all that is mentioned in the subse quent anuyajati. In accordance with the last of the above explanations, the Agni sacrifice, performed after the Agnishțoma, would become its subsidiary and hence the mention of its Result in the sentence Rdhnoti,etc. would be a mere Arthavada in accordance with the Sutra IViii.
pūrvatra tu svatantratvāt phalamātreyo nirdeśa/ diti phavidhitvātpuruṣārthamiti viśeṣaḥ	While according to the former interpretation, the Agni being an inde pendent sacrifice by itself, the sentence Rdhnoti,etc. would serve the purpose of laying down result following from that Sacrifice, in accordance with the Sutra IViii and as such the Agni sacrifice would come to be one performed for the sake of the accom plishment of a desirable end. Sutra The Material would be mentioned by the word, because the Injunction is for that purpose.
na dhagniśabdaḥ udbhidādivadyaugikaḥ / nāpi vākyabhedatatprakhyatajhapadeśatvairyukto yena karmanāmadheyatvaṃ vijñāyate /	Inasmuch as the word Agni is one that has its signification universally known, unless this signification is found to give rise to certain anomalies, like syntactical split, etc., we cannot reject the sense of Fire, and take the word as the name of a sacrifice. That is to say, the word Agni is not known to have any literal meaning, like the words Udbhid and the rest nor is it accompanied by any of the three conditions of Namadhēyaviz. Vakyabhēda, Tatprakhya and Tadvayapadeçã explained in Adh. I, Pada iv and hence it could not be taken as the Name of a sacrifice.
yattu tatprakhyamastītyuktaṃ bhavettadyadi ṛtvaṅgatvenāgnividhīyate, sa tu prāptakratvaṅgabhāva eva cayanasaṃskāratayā śrūyate	It has been urged above that it fulfils the Namadheya condition laid down in Sutra Iiv. But it would have been so if the Agni were actually enjoined in the sentence, as a part of the Sacrifice. matter of fact, it is as already forming part of the sacrifice, that is mentioned in the sentence, as something to be purified by Cayend bollection. The rense thinava hanti, of the reply is that, as in the case of the sentence so here also, there is no incongruity in the two Chayana and Agni being related, without coextensiveness, as the purification and something to be purified respectively.
tasmādagniśabdasya prasiddhārtha grācitvāccinoteśca yāgābhidhānāśaktadravya devatābhāvāccāgniṃ cayanena saṃskarotītyetāvāneva codanātha 'va dhāryate	Thus then, the word Agni being found to have its ordinary wellknown signification, and the word cinute, not signifying a sacri fice, and being devoid of any mention of a Deity or a substance, the sense of the Injunction comes to be that one should prepare the Fire by means of Cayana. In this manner, the Accusative ending in Agnim also becomes justified. While if the word Agni were the name of a sacrifice, it would be as difficult to justify the Accusative ending in the present case, as it is in agnihotram juhuyāt.
yadi hyayamagniśabdaḥ samānādhikaraṇaḥ syāttato dukhaṃ nīyeta /	That is to say, if the word Agni were coextensive with agnishtomēna, then it would be very difficult to connect it properly with the rest of the sentence. So also if the Accusative ending in Agnim signified the objective.
yadi baiṣā karmaṇi dvitīyā syāt /	As a matter of fact however the word Agni is not coextensive with agnishtomēna and as for the Accusative ending in it, it is due to the presence of the karmapravacanīya anu vide Pāṇini Iiv, and IIiii.
ayaṃ tu vyabhikaraṇaḥmantravārtika /	Hence it is that the sentence means that the sacrifice should be performed after the said peration of fire.
karmapravacanīyayukta dvitīyā atrāyamartho agnicayanamanvagniṣṭomādibhiryaṣṭavyamiti	romena, et serve the Thus then, all the sentences agnim purpose of making the Fire a subsidiary to Serifices Question When the Fires have already been mentioned th original Injunction, as subsidiaries to the original sacrificy of t toma, why should they have been mentioned over agit in the sequent sentences, in connection with the modifications of the original sacrifice ? olman This we shall explain later on, under Sutra.
na cāvaṇyaṃ tunyajātīyayoreva paurvāparyaṃ bhavati /	Nor is it necessary that preceden and sequence as signified by the word anu should uld always be between objects of the same class because we actually find such sequence between heterogeneous objects also as for instance, we do not find any incongruity in the sentence eats after the cooking.
tathā pākamanubhuṅkta iti avirodhopapatteḥ	It has been urged above that in the sentence Devadatta follows Yajñadatta we find a sameness of action.
tatsaṃyogāt ṛtustadākhyaḥ syāttena dharmavidhānāni	But in that case it is all right as the other noun is simply mentioned in the Nominative, without any other being mentioned in corhection with it and as such it is only right that the only action mentioned should be attributed to it as well.
agneḥ stotramityādiṣvagatyāśrayaṇaṃ jvalanena saṃbaddhaṃ stha ucyate nāpi tadvān kratuḥ /	In the case of such sentences as agneh çastram that have been cited by the Purvapaksha as showing that Agni is the name of a sacrifice, we have to take recourse to indirect indication, as there is no other way in which the sentence could be explained. In this sentence the word Agni indicates the place or altar connected with Fire, and this place indicates the sacrifice performed at that altar and thus it is by a very indirect process that the word Agni can indicate the sacrifice.
na caikatra khacaṇāśrayaṇamiti sarvacaiva sā ''śrayitavyeti /	But the fact of such indirect indication being accepted in one place does not make it necessarily acceptable in all other cases.
tasmātmatyāṃ gatau dravyavacanatvameva yutam /	Hence in the case in question, where the indirect indication can be very well avoided, it is only right that we should accept the word Agni as signifying the substance Fire.

But all these questions have already been dealt with in connection with other similar sentences, and And the Author ere have not taken them up for consideration here. refered to also has introduced them here only way of showing off the excellence of is emory.
dvitīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Sutra When there is a difference of Context, there is difference in the Bhāvanā.
prakaraṇāntare prayojanānyatvama gataṃ guṇalakṣaṇabhedaprasaktānuprasaktaṃ kīdṛśo guṇaḥ pūrva trāsaṃbhavan bhinatti kīdṛśo vā tatraiva saṃbhavatīti /	We have finished the consideration of the question of the Differentia tion of actions by means of Accessories, and we have also dealt with all sideissues of such questions, as to what sort of Accessory is that men tioned in the subsequent sentence, which, not being applicable to the action mentioned in the previous sentence, makes that mentioned in the subsequent action different from it and which sort is that which is appli cable to the previous action, and as such does not make any difference in the Action.
idānīṃ paryavasiteṣu pañcasu bhedakāraṇeṣu prakaraṇāntaralakṣaṇo bhedaḥ prastūyate /	And the five means of differentiation having been dealt with, we now proceed to consider the differentiation of actions by Context.
yathaiva vannabhyāṃ pāṭaliputre vā agnihotrādiśabda uccāryamāṇo nārthāntaraṃ pratipādayati evaṃ prakaraṇāntarepi /	Such words as Agnihotra, and the like, having already on one occa sion denoted a certain action, the mere fact of the word occurring after a long interval does not make any difference in the Action itself. That is to say, just as whether the word Agnihotra is uttered in Valabhi or in Pataliputra, it does not signify two different things so no matter whe ther the word occur in one context or in another, its denotation can not be different.
na hi prakaraṇāntaraṃ tasyārthābhidhānaśaktimabhivyanakti	For certainly the difference in the context does not bring about a fresh denotative potency in the word.
na cāvaśyamaṅgaireva kratvantaraṃ gantavyaṃ pradhānamapi paripūrṇe karaṇāśe tantravārtika /	And hence the verbs yajate, juhoti, etc., also as qualified by these words Agnihotra, etc., do not signify anything different specially as the absence of another meaning does not make anything meaningless or irrelevant. For, in the case in question, the mention of the month is not incom patible with the ordinary Agnihotra because the monthly Agnihotra could very well be taken as an alternative to the Lifelong Daily Agnihotra.

tasmādevamapi tānyevāgnidocādīnīti prāpta ucyate	Or again, the sentence might be taken as referring to the same Agnihotra, etc., with a view to enjoin them, as, together with the Soma sacrifices mentioned in connection with the Kundapāyināmayuna, bringing “about a certain result.

To the above we make the following reply In the sentence in question, we find that the Monthly Agnihotra is laid down as to be performed after the Upasads whereas we do not find any such Upasads preceding the original Agnihotra and as such the two Agnihotras must be different. and a son de That is to say, if the sentence in question had simply laid down the month, then we could have thought that the time had been laid down with reference to the original Agnihotra.
na ca naiyamika tāḥ svārthāḥ parārthā vā vidyante /	In connection with the original Agnihotra, however, we do not find any mention of these Upasads, either as foreign to it, or as forming an integral part of it.
yadi tu tāstaduttarakājavaṃ māsava vidhīyeran evaṃ satyane kāryaviṣānādvākyabhedaḥ syāt yadyapi prakṛte tasminnagnihotre bhavedidam /	If, again, the sentence were taken as laying down the Upasads, the sequence to the Upasads, and the Month, then, there being various objects of Injunction, there would be a syntactical split. This also meets all the other declarations of the Purvapakshathat the sentence lays down the performability, in the midst of the Satra, of the otherwise prohibited Agnihotra, either as an independent sacrifice, or as a part of the Satra itself.
tatraitatsyādicāpyupasaddhicaritvetyanuṣaṅgādagni pocatutyatva miti /	Because in all these cases, the mention of the sequence to the Upasads and of Month would be wholly meaningless. When, however, the sentence is taken as laying down a distinct Agnihotra, there would be nothing incongruous in the laying down of many things. Hence the sentence must be taken as laying down a distinct Agnihotra.
sa dayaktam /	Such is the Siddhanta as represented by the Bhashya.
kutaḥ	But there is something to be said against this representation of the Sid lhänta.
tatrānuṣaṅgo yukto yaca tena vināna kiṃ cidukta bhavati / yathā'traiva māsaṃ vaiśvadevenetyādiṣu yāvat yajataiti nānuṣajyate tāvaśa kiṃ ciduktamityavagyamanuṣaktavyam /	It is as fo llows If the Agnihotras were taken as distinct, only because of the fact of there otherwise being a syntactical split,then the present instance too becomes one of the Differentiation of Actions by means of syntactical split already dealt with above, and not by that of Context what is really meant to be shown here. Or, again, the Actions would be different on account of the impossibility of the manifold accessories mentioned in the sentence in question belonging to the original Agnihotra and thus the necessary differentiation being done by Accessories, there would be no room for the functioning of the Difference of Context towards that differentiation.

That is to say, the sentence masam darçapūrṇamāsabhyām lays down only the connection of the sacrifice with the Month and as such there being no syntactical split, there would be nothing to show that the Darçapürnamāsa herein mentioned is different from that mentioned before.
tatra tu punaḥ punaścaritve tyasya vidhānāt yāvadanuṣaṅgamupasadāmanuṣṭhānaṃ prāpnoti/	The following argument might here be brought forward We could connect the clause upasadbhiç caritva with this second sentence also and that would make this case exactly similar to that of the Agni hotra.
aniṣṭaṃ caitat vedābhyanujñānābhāvāt /	But this is scarcely correct because it is only when no sense is got.

That is to say, the supplying of words from without is allowable only in such cases where without those words, no meaning is obtained. As for instance, in the sentence māsam vaiçvaḍēvēna, unless we supply the word yajate from the previous sentence, the sentence gives no meaning whatever and hence this supplying is allowable. In the case in question, on the other hand, the sentence māsum darçapūrṇamāsābhyām,etc. is com plete in itself, and stands in need of nothing from outside itself. And the clause upasadbhiçcaritva also has already had its use in the former sentence, and stands in need of no other sentence with which it could be connected.
tasmānnaiyākhyānamupapadyataityevaṃ varṇanīyam	And thus we find that there is no reason for the said supplying of the clause.
idda tāvat naiva prakaraṇāntara sadbhāvāta bhedo 'vagamyate kiṃ maī pūrva prakaraṇavicchedāt	That is to say, when no idea of the original Agnihotra is present in the mind, at the time that the sentence in question is met with, then the action mentioned in this latter cannot but be recognized as differ ent from the previous Agnihotra. And as for the difference of Contexts, even though it is present, it does not serve any useful purpose with regard to the differentiation as we shall show under Sutra IIiii.
sarvatra ca vicchinnaprakaraṇasya karmaṇaḥ saṃvandhitantravārtika /	In all cases, we find that the factors connected with the Action, when Context has been wholly cut off, are mentioned in two ways as an upadeya i.e., capable of being brought about by human effort, and as such forming the object of an Injunction, and as an anupadeya which cannot be so brought about and be an object of Injunction.

tatraiva karma kartavyamiti atha nopanayati tataḥ sa evotpādayatyapīti nirūpyate /	And when this challenge has been thrown out, if we find any sentence presenting the Action in the requisite form, then the challenging sentence also serves to lay down the same Action with reference to a particular place or time,etc. If, however, it fails to be brought up by any other Injunctive sentence, then, conclude that that very Injunction serves as the originative Injunction of that Action.

Because it is not possible for any person to bring about the Month today, for the and as such the Month never being capable of being the object of an Injunction, and ever retaining the character of the anupadeya, it must be admitted that it is the Homa that is laid down with reference to the Month and as the injunctive potency of this sentence is not in any way set aside by the former originative Injunction of the Agnihotra, the Action, which has been taken as being enjoined with reference to the Month, comes to be primarily brought up by the sentence in question.
na cotpannasya punarutpattiḥ saṃbhavatītyapūrvavidhānaṃ vijñāyate /	And as there can be no originative Injunction of that which has already been once enjoined, we conclude the Action laid down in the sentence in question to be distinct from that laid down in the previous sentence.
yatra vākyāntaragatamapi sannidhānamātrādeva pratyabhijñāyamānaṃ na bhidyate tatra skhavākyagatena nāmnopanīyamānaṃ na pratyabhi jāsyataiti kuta etat /	Objection Inasmuch as the word Agnihotra in the sentence in question is the same as that which appears along with the former originative Injunction of the Agnihotra, it sets aside the capability of the sentence in question to enjoin the same Action and as such this would come to have its injunctiveness restricted to the connection of the Month with the same Action. And then, when an Action, that is presented to the mind only by means of its proximity to the sentence in question, is not admitted to be enjoined over again as a distinct Action then it would be all the more impossible for that Action to be enjoined over again, which is presented to the mind by its very name.
sannidhānena hi yādageva deśādivākyeṣu karmāvagamyate tāigevopatiṣṭhataiti na bhidyate /	That is to say, if by mere proximity, the Action, mentioned in the sentence speaking of the particular place, time, etc., happens to be presented in exactly the same form by the previous sentence, we do not admit the actions to be different.
nāmadheyaṃ punarārāditastāvadākhyāta paratantratvāt naiva bhedābhedayorvyāpriyate /	As for the Name, however, as, from the very outset, it is dependent upon the Verb, it can have nothing to do with the difference or nondifference of Actious.

nāmnā dhātvarthamātraṃ ca saṃnighāpyeta śaktitaḥ /	That is to say, it is a universally acknowledged fact that, in all cases, Names belong to the Rootmeanings through coextensiveness, and not to the Bhavanas that is to say, the sentence agnihotram juhuyat is always explained as agnihotrēņa homena juhuyāt, wherein the name Agnihotra is expressed as coextensive with the Homa which is signified by the root hu, and not with the Bhavana which is expressed by the Injunctive affix in juhūyāt.
bhāvanā tvanupasthānādbhidyamānā 'vadhāryate	And thus it is found that the purpose i.e., Bhavana of the two sentences is distinct.

nāmnā hi tadupādānamātmanopāyi codite /	That is to say, the Rootmeaning would appear as different only when the Root used would be wholly dissimilar from the Name.
satre tu yajyaśravaṇāt nāmamātropanītaprakṛtayāgapratyabhijñānāttadbhāvanāmātrabhedaḥ /	In the case of the Satra, however, we find that there is no mention of the root yaji, and that the Name employed gives rise to the idea of the previous sacrifice and hence in this case, it is only the Bhāvanā that is different in the two cases.
tasmātmādhūktaṃ prakaraṇāntare prayojanānyatvamiti /	Thus then the words of the Sutra prakaraṇāntare prayojanānyatvam become fully justified Prayojana =Bhavanā.
bhāṣyakāra upasadbhiścaritveti tavacitakāla mevānupādeyarūpaṃ bhedacetutvena darśayatīti draṣṭavyam /	There are people who hold the differentia tion in the case cited in the last Adhikarana to be made by a Difference of Context only according to the Bhashya while others according. to the Värtika hold it to be made by the connection of a particular time and they do not admit of any differentiation brought about merely by such agencies as nonproximity or the relationship of an anupaděya substance. It is with a view to explain the real state of things to these persons that the present Sutra has been introduced.
athocyeta upasadopi vidhoyantaityādi cābhyāmādhikaraṇavadabhyupetyavādena samarthayitavyam tatra phalamudāhṛtameva saṃskāryaṃ ma pyudāhṛtaṃvyam/	Though, as in the case of the Atiratra, etc., so in these also, we do not find any mention of the root yaji, yet, inasmuch as, without the inference of the presence of the root yaji, the sentences containing the words with the Nominal affix would remain incomplete, the yaji is inferred directly as the sentences have been pronounced, and hence the sentences do not stand in need of the yaji occurring in any other sentence and hence the actions mentioned in them must be taken as distinct from any others previously mentioned. Then as for the other two Anupadeyasthe Result and the Object to be purified or preparedwe proceed to consider them now, amenable, as they are, to the same line of reasoning.
caiṣātavyā doghaṇoyeti yajamānasaṃskārārthatvenopādānāt /	And as for the mention of the object to be purified, we have the sentence Traidhātavīyā dīkshaniya, etc., which lays down a purificatory rite for the sacrificer.
anārabhya kiṃ ciditi prakaraṇāntarāvarodhābhāvajñāpanārthaṃ, tatra yāgoddeśenā havanīyādivat phalaṃ vidheyaṃ, śakyaṃ hi tatpuruṣeṇa darśapūrṇamāsasthenāpi kāmayitu miti ma tvāi prākṛteṣu phala vidhiriti /	The Bhashya speaks of the sentences as being found without reference to any particular Action and this is done with a view to show that the case in question is not capable of being dealt with under Difference of Context. Prakrtēshu phalavidhiriti. The reply to this is that the Result can never be enjoined. The sense of this is that, on account of the reasons shown under Sutra VIi, of the Svängakāmädhikarana, the Result has always the character of the uddegya that subject with regard to which something else is enjoined. Because if the Result were enjoined, it could be so only with regard to the Action and as such becoming a part of the Action itself, it would lose its character of Result to be brought about by that Action.
siddhāntavādī tu svargakāmādhikaraṇasiddhaṃ pratyarthaṃ cābhisaṃyogāditi phaloddeśyatvaṃ matvā vadati na śakyate phalaṃ vidhātumiti /	The same line of reasoning would apply also to the case of the sentence that speaks of a purificatory rite for the sacrificer. R Nor is it possible for the transient Desire for certain results to be the means of accomplishing such eternal Actions as the Agneya,etc. and this is what it would come to if the sentences were taken as laying down the Result with reference to sacrifices. Sutra When there is proximity, there is no separation and hence the second mention is for the purpose of pointing out another Result. The present Adhikaraṇa is introduced by way of counterinstance.
vidhīyamānaṃ kiyāṅgatvādaphalameva prāpnoti /	The mention of the Result in the Sutra indicates all other Anupadeyas. And hence the sentences forming the subjectmatter of the present Adhikarana are all the following Agneyoshṭakapālo bhavati....
kriyāpi vā vidhīyamānā tādayeṃ pratipadyamānā niṣphancaiva syāt phalagrahaṇaṃ pradarśanamātraṃ sarvāṇi tu deśādīnyapyudāirtavyānīti same darśapūrṇamāmābhyāṃ yajeta paurṇamāsyā paurṇamāsyā yajeta yāvajjīvaṃ darśapūrṇamāsābhyāṃ yajeta darśapūrṇamāsābhyāṃ svargakāmo yajeta śeṣāt sviṣṭakṛtaṃ yajatīti sarvatra pūrvādhikaraṇena degādīni prati vidhīyamānatvāt karmāntaratvaṃ prāptam /	etaya annadyakamam yajayet, or Darçapürnamāsabhyām svargākāmo yajeta, Çëshāt svishtakṛtam yajet,etc. mentioning the Result Same Darçapürṇamāsābhyam yajet mentioning the Place Paurṇamāsyām Paurṇamāsyā yajēt mentioning the Time and Yavajjivam Darçapurnamāsābhyam yayēt mentioning the Oc casion. Inasmuch as all these sentences lay down certain Actions, with reference to a particular Result, Place, etc., we conclude, in accordance with the foregoing Adhikaraṇa, that these Actions are other than those previously mentioned. And in favour of this view, we have the following arguments Inasmuch as there can be no Injunction of that which has already been enjoined, we would have to take the names of Actions in the sentences in question as mere references to the original Actions of those names if we do not take the Actions as distinct and that which is referred to is that which is the Uddēçya that with regard to which something else is laid down but as a matter of fact, we do not find the Actions mentioned in the sentences to have the character of the Uddēçya. That is to say, that which is referred to always being the Uddėçya, if the Actions were taken as referred to, then they would have the character of Uddēçyas and there could be no relationship between two Uddeçyas viz., the Action and the Result, Place, etc..
deśādyuddeśena tu vidhīyamānānāṃ karmaṇāṃ svarūpānuvādakampanaṃ yugapadvidhyanuvādadoṣādayuktam /	While if the names of actions occurring in the sentences were taken as referring to the forms of these Actions, which, at the same time, are being enjoined with reference to the Result, Place, etc.,then, inasmuch as this would involve a simultaneous Injunction and Reference, it would be highly objectionable. To the above we make the following reply The potency of the Injunction varies according as it happens to be an originative or an ap plicatory one.
tasmātkarmāntarāṇīti prāpte 'bhidhīyate	And hence when it is practicable, we take it as having the potency of only one but when that is not found possible, we accept it as having both.
na cāpyuddiśyamānatvamanuvādatvakāraṇam / nopādānaṃ vidheyatve prāptyaprāptivaśe hi te viparivṛttireva cehāvibhāgagabdenoktā viśeṣeyātvaveṣṭaveitacchabda pratyayāditi /	But the case of the sentence in question not being like this, we have to admit it to have the double potency, not be a Nor is the character of the Uddēçya a necessary cause of being referred to nor, conversely, is the character of Upādēya capable of being brought about a necessary cause of being enjoined because whether a certain Action is to be taken as referred to or as enjoined, in any particular sentence, depends upon the fact of its having been already enjoined or not in a previous sentence. Though as a rule, Place, etc., as having the character of the Ann padeya, are the objects referred to, yet, when even these are found to be such as have not been mentioned before, they are accepted as objects of Injunction.
prayojanetu codayanti karmāntarevi kinnaitacchabdakatāt sādṛśyapratyayāt āgneyādīnyeva ivaṣoti kathamanya iviṣko yāga iti /	The use of the present Adhikarana has been expressed by the Bhashya, as lying in the fact that, if the sentence in question refers to the original Aveshti, then, the substance, to be offered at the sacrifice performed for the acquiring of Food, would be the Agneya Cake while if the Action were other than the Aveshti, then we would have some other substance. To this, however, some people make the following objection Even if the Action spoken of in the sentence etaya annādyakāmam yājayēt’ were other than the original Avështi, then too, inasmuch as the word etaya would point to the fact of this other Action being similar to the Aveshti, the substance employed at it would be the same as that used in the Aveshti, and no other substance would have to be used.
tattvacodyama /	But this objection is not quite pertinent.
jyotirādivadetacchabdasya prastūyamānamukhārthepipattau satyāṃ sāibhyanaśaṇānupapatteḥ /	Because so long as it is possible for the word etaya to be taken, as in the case of the sentence esha jyotih, etc., in its direct sense, as referring to the Action to be spoken of immediately after it,it cannot be rightly taken as indirectly indicating similarity.
tasmātmaṣṭhakta karmāntare'nyahaviṣko yāga iti /	Hence there is nothing incorrect in the assertion another substance will have to be used at the sacrifice.
evamuktāni māpavāḍhāni ṣaṭ bhedakāraṇāni/	We have finished the consideration of all the six causes of differen tiation, together with their exceptions.
vṛttyantare tu catvāryeva bhedakāraṇāni śabdāntara saṃjñāguṇaphalānyudāhṛtāni /	In another commentary by Bhavadasa, perhaps only four such causes are mentioned, viz. Difference of Words, Difference of Names, Difference of Accessory Details, and Difference of Result. He has included Repetition and Number in Difference of Words, and the Difference of Context, etc., in the Difference of Result, because all that the Context does is to help the Result.
punaḥ śrutisaṃkhyayoḥ śabdāntaraevāntarbhāvāt prakaraṇāntarasya ca phalādyanugrahamātrārthatvāt /	Because, in the first place, Repetition cannot be included in Difference of Words as if the word yajati is repeated five times, or any number of times for the matter of that, it does not become a different word. And when the word prajapatyan is used, by way of Ekaçesha, as pointing to seventeen Prājāpatyas, we do not have so many different words, as the word is actually found to be one and the same only, in all cases.
tattvayuktamiva dṛśyate	This is what has been explained under Sutra Ii, and also in Sutra Ii.
tasmādakaśabdaye satyeva kāraṇāntarādbhedamapaśyataḥ śabdāntarakalpanaṃ tatra bhavato bhāṣyāmantravārtike /	Consequently we conclude that in such cases, not being able to find other ground for differentiating the Actions, the Author of this Commentary has gratuitously assumed the words to be different, even though, as a matter of fact, the word is one and the same.
ntarakṛtaḥ, prakaraṇāntaratvācca vinā phalādīnāmabhedakatvamuktamapi na dṛṣṭaṃ ‘sannidhau tvavibhāgāt /	Secondly, this Author of the Commentary has failed to grasp the fact of the Result, etc., not being able to differentiate Actions, when the Context does not happen to be differenta fact that has been shown over and over again, in the Sutra just explained IIiii, and also in Sutra IIii, et seq.
tena pratyabhijñānanimittatvāt phalādyanugrahītaṃ prakaraṇāntarameva bhedakāraṇaṃ bhavedapyupeścitam /	And thus we find that though it is the Difference of Context, as helped by the mention of the Result, etc., that, being the cause of nonrecognition of one Action as the other, is the real means of differentiating Actions, yet the said Commentator has wholly neglected this fact in including the Difference of Context in the Difference of Result.
phalaṃ ca prakarapāntarāntarbhūtatvena na nirościtam /	Thirdly, he failed to perceive that it was the Difference of Result that was included in Difference of Context, and not vice versâ.
yadapyekaṃ vā saṃyogarūpacodanākhyāviśeṣādityekatve hetu viparyaya catuṣṭayamasya jñāpakamityuktam /	G It has been argued by the adherents of this Commentator that the fact of only four opposites of the ground of identity being mentioned in the Sutra IIiv, distinctly points to the fact of the ground of difference also being only four.
tadapi prastute 'dhikaraṇe 'nyeṣāmasaṃbhavāditi nānocitam /	we But we do not attach any such significance to the Sutra, in the present connection because in the Alhikarana under consideration, find no other means of Differentiation applicable save the Difference of Context which therefore could not be denied as a means of Differentia tion.
tasmādyayoktāḥ ṣaḍeva bhedahetavaḥ /	Hence we conclude that there are six means of Differentiation as explained above.
tatrāpi ta siddhānte saṃjñāśabdāntarayorguṇasaṃkhyayośca bhedo vaktavyaḥ sa nokta ityabhidhīyate	But for the Siddhanta too, it was necessary to explain what difference there is between Difference of Names and Difference of Words as Name is also a Word, and between Property and Number as Number is also a Property. And inasmuch as this has not been done before, we proceed to explain it now. Inasmuch as the Name does not express the form of the Action, the Difference of Names is distinct from Difference of Words and because Number pervades all the objects as forming one complete whole, the Difference of Number is distinct from Difference of Property.
saṃkhyāpi yugapadane kotpadyamāna samavetā pūrvāsaṃbhavadgaṇāntarādbhidyataiti	Sutra The Agneya would appear as if it were to be re peated, because of reasons already explained. We find the sentence Agnèyoshṭākapālo amāvāsyāyām bhavati, and then again, Agneyoshṭakapālo amāvāsyāyām paurṇamāsyancacyuto bhavati this latter occurring in the text before the former.
punaḥ śrutirananyārthā bhedikatyavadhāritā /	It has been shown above that it is only when the Repetition is found to serve no other purpose that it can be taken as serving the purpose of differentiating Actions.
tādṛśī ceyamityeva dvirāgneyaḥ prayujyatām	And in the case in question, we ac tually find the Repetition serving no other purpose hence we take it to mean that the Agnēya is to be performed twice over.
tatra paścāntaramāī	Sutra The Action not being found to be differentiated, the mere repetition of the same Action would not make any dif ference in the Action itself.
anyārthā vā punaḥ śrutiḥ	Or, according to the lawyugapatpravrtteryatha syāt sattvadar çanam i.e., two sentences operating simultaneously, we must take.
sarvathā punaḥ śrutiprayojaneṣva trānviṣyamāṇeṣu guṇasṭyāśravaṇāt parisaṃkhyāyāśca tridoṣatvādarthavādārthavve 'bhyupagate kasmārthavāda bārtika / iti vivicyā saṃkīrtanāt nūnamāgneyasyaiveti matvā vadati sārthavādakena vihitena kiṃ pradeśāntarasthenaikavākyatāmanāgacchatā'rthavādeneti /	Though this theory, here brought forward, has been refuted in the Abhyasadhikarana, yet the Siddhānti has boldly given expression to these rejected views, because he has still in store his principal theory, which he brings forward in the next Sutra and he does not really hold to those views because the Veda can never bear the charge of meaninglessness. Sutra The repetition serves quite another purpose. When we proceed to look into the various purposes that are served by Repetitions, we find that, inasmuch as the sentence in question does not mention any qualifying accessory, and as Preclusion of the Rest is accom panied by a threefold anomaly, we conclude that it serves the of an Arthavada.
vidhiśeṣatvaṃ ārthavādānāmavasthitam /	And as it is not quite clear in the sentence itself of what it is an Arthavada, it must be taken as that of the Agneya itself.

It has been shown above that the Arthavada forms part of the Injunction.” This objection in the Bhashya has been brought forward from the standpoint of the Purvapaksha. It, however, contains the sentence The Deity is the same whether it is praised or not praised and we do not quite understand what this means though on looking into it closely it seems that it recalls what has gone before in the Mahendrādhikaraṇa, under the Sutra IIi. The sense thus is that just as though greatness does not form an integral part of the Deity, yet, inasmuch as in one case mere Indra without the epithet Maha fulfils the functions of the Deity, the epithet of Maha would be useless in an Arthavada that would refer to the Injunction,so, in the same manner in the case in question also, an independent glorification by itself would be altogether meaningless.
praśasta gandairavadhāritena vākyāntarāt kevaladevatena/ kartuṃ sahendreṇa punaḥ praśaṃsāṃ punaḥ śrutiḥ samyagihāśriteyam	To the above objection we make the following reply What the repetition is meant here to do is to serve the purpose of glorifying, by words signifying excellence, Agni together with Indra, the latter being mentioned in another sentence aindran dadhi amāvāsyāyām which mentions only the Deity Indra.
yāvajjīviko 'bhyāsaḥ karmadharmaḥ prakaraṇāt	PĀDA IV. Sutra The lifelong repetition is a property of the Action because of the Context.
bahṛcabrāhmaṇe adhvaryubrāhmaṇe vā śrūyataiti nātīvābhiniveṣṭavyam / nana kartṛdharmaḥ karmadharma iti śeṣanāṇaviṣayatvādii na saṃbadhyate /	Though the sentences in question are found both in the Bahvrca Brahmana the Brahmana of the Rgveda and the Adhwarya Brāhmaṇa Brāhmaṇa the Brā the Brahmana of the Yajurveda, yet the name of only one of these is mentioned in the Bhashya but it does not matter in which particular Brāhmaṇa the sentence is found. d Objection Whether a word expresses the property of an Action or that of the Agent, is a question connected with the subjectmatter of the Third Adhyaya and hence its introduction here seems to be wholly irrelevant.
ke cidāhaḥ / paryavasite khakṣaṇārthe nadīyopi vicāraḥ pratyāsatteḥ kriyamāṇo na virudhyataiti /	To this some people make the following reply The treatment of the subject matter of the Second Adhyāya itself having been finished, and the Third Adhyaya also being near at hand, there is nothing very incongruous in the introduction, at this stage, of a subject connected with the latter.
tattvayuktam /	But this explanation is scarcely right.
śākhāntare karmabhedavicārasyādyāpyaparyavasānāt	Because we have still got to consider the question of the Difference or Nondifference of Actions as mentioned in the various texts of the same Veda and as such all the subjects of the present Adhyaya have not yet been exhausted.
tatra yadi yāvajjīvakālaḥ karma dharmatvena vidhīyate tataḥ sāyaṃprātarvākyava śena tatkāla samāpanamagnihotraṃ na śaknoti tāvantaṃ kālaṃ pūrayitu mityarthāt jyotiṣṭomavaḍhabhyastarūpameva prayogaṃ pratiṣatyane	If then, the timewhole of ones lifewere laid down as a property of the Action, then the mere offering of the Morning and Evening libationsin accordance with the injunctions should offer the morning libation with the Mantra Suryo jyotiḥ, etc., and he should offer the evening libation with the Mantra Agnirjoytih,etc. would not be enough to complete the Agnihotra, till the specified timelifelongexpires and hence a performance of the Agnihotra would come to be made of many daily repetitions just as the performance of the Jyotishtoma is made up of the repetition of the same process with regard to each of the many grahas. If, on the other hand, living be taken as the occasion or cause, with reference to which the sentence lays down the Action, then, inasmuch as the occasion would last till the Performer lasts, the Action would come to be enjoined without reference to any desirable result and as such a neglect of the performance being sinful, it would be necessary for the Man to perform it as long as he lives, either for the fulfilment of his own duty, or for the avoiding of the sin incurred by nonperformance and hence, in this case, the sentence would lay down a Restriction or Duty for the Man.
karmastho hi kathaṃbhāvastadaṅgamabhikāṅkṣati /	For these reasons we must conclude that the Bhashya has put the question in the form that it has, simply with a view to the distinctness o S C otherwise of the performance as it is this that comes to be the upshot of the question put by the Bhashya.
kānopadeśapa ca tattathaivopapadyate atha vā jīvanaparimitakāladvāreṇābhyāsa śvodayiṣyate /	That is, when the time is the object laid down, the Repetition due to the prescribed time becomes a part of the Artion. and this alone would be in keeping with the Context. Objection Even when lifelong is made the property of the Agent, then too, inasmuch as it is the same Action that would be laid down during life, the Context would not in any way be interfered with..
sa ca karmeddeśena śakyataeva vidhātumityevamupadiśyate /	But the Context, which provides the method of the Action, stands in need of a property of the Action and hence if a property of the Agent were laid down, that Context would certainly be interfered with.
kartṛdharmapakṣe punarna kathaṃ cita karmoddeśaḥ /	Or, we might take the sentence as enjoining, through the time of its performance which is the whole lifetime, the Repetition of the Sacrifice and there would be nothing incongruous in this, as the Repetition is quite capable of being enjoined with reference to the Action.
evaṃ caikaprayogatve sati dīrghasa traprayogasaṃstava upapanno bhaviṣyati / itarathā punaḥ pratidinaṃ paryavasānānna kathaṃ cit satrasārūpyaṃ bhavet, tasmātkarmadharmo'bhyāsa iti	g Thus then the daily repetitions of the Agnihotra throughout ones lifetime making up its single performance, it is only thus that we could explain the application to the Agnihotra of those eulogies that belong to Satras that is to say, it is only when the performance of the Agnihotra is completed in many days, that it could be similar to the Satras that always take many days to finish, and thereby be capable of being eulogised by the same eulogies as these Satras otherwise if the Agnihotra were finished every day, it would have no similarity with the Satras and as such the sentence laying down the same eulogies with regard to the Agnihotra would be inexplicable.
yāvajjīvapadākhyāta śrutivṛttitva saṃbhavaḥ / matpate, bhavatastatra lakṣaṇāvṛttatā bhavet	Sutra It must be taken as a property of the Agent, because of the direct signification of the words. The word Dharmaḥ is to be supplied from the preceding Sutra and hence the proposition laid down by the Siddhanta is that It is the$ property of the Agent that is enjoined.
juhotiyajatibhyāmapyabhyāsaḥ yatra hi vidhiḥ samāpyate sa codanātha bhavati/ bhavataśva jīvanadhātvartha parityāgena kānjābhyāsau vidhīyete/	Because in our interpretation of the sentence, both the words yāvajjīvam and the verb juhotiretain their direct signification, while in your interpretation, they will have to be taken in their indirect indicated meanings. That is to say, in our theory, it is by direct signification that the word yāvajjīvam denotes the lifetime of the agent as the occasion for the Action and in the verbs juhoti and yajati also, it is only directly that the Affix signifies the Bhāvanā as qualified by the Rootmeaning.
tena lakṣaṇāparyavasāyī vidhiḥ prāpnoti / tatraitat syādyā'vajjovamiti yāvacchabdaḥ śrutyaiva kājaṃ bravīti /	In your interpretation, on the other hand, life time not being capable of directly qualifying the Action indicates the time, and the verbs also would indicate Repetition then again, that wherein the Injunction ends, is accepted as the object of that Injunction hence it will be necessary for you to reject the direct denotations of the words Jiva and the verb, and make Time and Repetition the objects of the Injunction and thus your Injunction comes to be based upon Indirect.
tadyathā yāvaddoī svapiti /	Indication. The following argument might here be brought forward It is by direct signification that the word yavat, in the compound yāvājjīvam, denotes time as in the sentence yavaddoham svapiti He sleeps till the milking time.
yuktamatra kālagrahaṇaṃ vartamānāpadeśo hyayaṃ nātra kā cinnimitāpekṣā tena śrutivṛttaṃ dohanamatikramya kābo gṛhṇate/ yadi tvicāpi yāvaddocaṃ svapyāṭāsīta veti vidhīyeta tataḥ kena vā dohasya nimitvaṃ vāyeta	Reply In the case of the sentence yavaddoham svapiti, it is only proper that the word yavat should be taken as expressing time because it speaks of a thing in the present, and there is no need of the mention of an occasion and hence in this case the directly expressed milking of the cow is rejected in favour of the Time. If in this sentence also, we had the injunctive svapyāt or ‘āsīta instead of the Present svapiti, then nothing could set aside the fact of milking being the occasion for sleeping. In the case of the Injunction yavajjivam, etc., however, we have no cause for rejecting the direct denotation of the word because it is quite possible for the action of living which forms the direct denotation of the root Jiva to be the occasion for the Agnihotra.
na ca yāvacchabdaḥ kālavacanaḥ ka cit prasiddhaḥ kriyāmeva ta mamāptiparyantatvena viśinaṣṭi /	Nor is the word yavat ever known as denotative of time specially as all that it is found to do is to qualify the action of living as extending to its finish. Objection As there is no difference between Time and Action as according to some philosophers Time is nothing more than the Action of the Sun and the Moon, if we take the word ‘yāvajjīvam to denote the time, we do not have recourse to indirect indication.
kriyākālayorabhedāt na nacapeti cet	Reply You could bring forward this argument only after you had But even granting that Action is Time, it must be admitted that there is some sort of a restriction, whereby all Actions are not known as Tim And as a matter of fact, of all Actions it is only the etion of the Rotation of the Sun and the Moon that is spoken of as Time and when this time of the rotation has once been used in limiting or characterising some other action in close proximity with it, then from this analogy, all other Actions also come to be measured by the same measure of time as that which had been applied to the former action. For instance, the exact measure of time of the milking of the cow, not being fixed by itself, people come to mark that time by referring it to a certain action on the part of the Sun.
kiyatā kānlena gaurduhyataityukte niyatānyeva muhūrtādīni pariccheda katvenopādīyante	That is to say, when it is askedby what time is the cow milked ?the answer is made in terms of the minutes and seconds whose extent has been previously ascertained and these minutes, etc., also are measured by such further divisions of time as the lava, truti, etc., that go to make the Naḍika, all of which are something wholly distinct from what is ordinarily known as Action.
na ca jīvanaṃ nāma nimeṣādivantriyataparimāṇaṃ yena paricchedakatva sāmarthyāt kālatvenāśrīyate na hokena prayogeṇa jīvakālo 'varudhyate /tantravārtika /	And when people have become used to it, the ordinary actions of the world also come to have their continuance approximately measured by those actions of Lava,etc. and it is thus that even ordinary Actions like the milking of the cow come to be used as measures of time and thus there is no actual identity between Time and Action. Then again, as a matter of fact, Life is not any fixed measure of time, like the action of Nimesha Twinkle of the Eye and as such it could not, on account of its this timemeasuring capacity, be taken as Time. And hence the fact remains that you have had recourse to the indirect indication of Time which is distinct from Life, which is the direct denotation of the word Jiva.
vitatenāparijñānādanyathā vā vṛthāśrutiḥ /	Over and above this you have recourse to the indirect indication of Repetition by means of the verb Juhoti.

And unless you accept an indication of the Repetition, the Injunction itself according to you would become meaningless. completed the action before his lifetime, he would have committed a grave wrong. While, on the other hand, if he were to die off, without having performed the remaining portions, then he would fall into the grave sin of leaving a commenced Action unfinished.
na ca sarvasvāra vacanamasti yena mṛtepi samāpyeta /	Nor, in connection with the Agnihotra, is there any Injunction that would enable the survivors to finish it for him as there is in the case of the Sarvasvara” sacrifice.

A E The following objection might be urged It might be that, in consideration of the Injunctions of the Evening and Morning Libations, a single offering of these Libations would fulfil both .e., the Morning and Evening Libations, as also the Lifelong Agnihotra, That is to say, just as the performance of the Paurṇamāsī sacrifice, though laid down as to be performed on the Paurnamasi day, yet its performance is accepted as complete, and the Injunction is taken as duly fulfilled, even when it is done in only a certain part of that day and the performance does not fill up the whole day so, in the same manner, though the Agnihotra is laid down as to be performed through ones lifetime, yet if we were to offer a single Morning and a single Evening Libation, these offerings alone could be accepted as fulfilling both the Injunctions in question for Morning and Evening also are portions of ones life time. To this we make the following reply All that the Injunction the Paurnamāsī sacrifice is to be performed on the Paurṇamāsī daydoes is to preclude the performance of that sacrifice on any other day except the Paurņamāsī and hence in this case, even if the whole day is not filled up, the Injunction is duly fulfilled.
vyātāvapi tatra myānna tvicaivaṃ pratīyate	It is not so in the case in question.

Conse quently, in that case, inasmuch as the sacrifice will have been performed on the Paurnamāsī day, and on no other,the Injunction will have been duly fulfilled as that is all that is meant by the Injunction, which says nothing as to the filling up of the whole day by the performance. In the for the performer, apart from his lifetime and as such there is no time that could be taken as precluded by the word lifetime conse quently if the time prescribed were not duly filled up, the whole sentence would become meaningless.
sāyaṃprāta śvodanayorapi jīvanakālāntargateḥ siddhatvāt yāvacchandaśva samastajīvitāvidhiprarigrahārtha ekadeśānuṣṭhāne dvitīyādhyāyasya caturthaḥ pāda /	Specially as the morning and evening also are included in the lifetime. As for the word yavat in the compound yāvajjīvam, it serves to point to the end of life as the limit of the performance and this too would be incompatible with the performance of the Agnihotra during a part of ones life only. Consequently, unless the Injunction of the Lifelong Agnihotra, mixed up as it is with that of the Morning and Evening. Libations, implied a repetition of the performance, it could not urge the agent to a rightful course of Action. And hence you can never avoid having recourse to Indirect Indication of the Repetition.
bādhitaḥ syāt /	Objection As in your case, so in ours also, the implied Repetition “would not be very incongruous.
ataḥ sāyaṃprātacodanāmiśreyamabhyāsamanācipantī na śaknoti puruṣaṃ niyoktumityaparihāryā lakṣaṇa	That is to say, you also tacitly assume the daily repetition of the Agnihotra and for you too, this Repetition can, at best, be only implied, as there is no word expressly laying down such Repetition the actual words of the text mentioning a single performance.
atha yoyaṃ mama doṣaḥ sa tavāpi doṣa eva, vaktavyo vā vi śeṣaḥ	Consequently the incongruity that you have shown against our theory would be equally present in your theory also. If not, you must explain what the difference is between our theories.

yattvarthādabhyāsa iti	It is just You have declared that the Repetition is tacitly assumed.
liṅdarśanācca karmadharme hi prakrameṇa niyamyeta tatra cānarthakamanyasyāt	Be Sutra Because we find indicative words to the same effect, if the time pertained to the Action, it would fill up the whole of it and the rest would be meaningless.
prakrameṇa hi karmakānaṃ saṃspaśadanatikrāntamityabhidhīyate /	Because if the performance of a certain action is begun at the prescribed time, it is admitted that the time has not been transgressed.
na ca kaścidapi pūrṇamāsayājī sannaprakramamāṇa eva jovanama tinlaṅghanyati na sai/ darśapūrṇamāmayājī syāt / atha svakālāparisamāpanamatipātanamucyeta tathā mṛtasya tadbhavatītyanarthakameva prāyaścittavidhānam /	And certainly one who is a performer of the DarçaPūrṇamāsa could never have allowed its prescribed time his lifetime to lapse without having begun its performance because if he were to die without having begun it, he would not be a performer of the DarçaPūrṇamāsa.” If by transgression were meant noncompletion during the prescribed time, then too, inasmuch as this noncompletion could be ascertained only after the death of the performer, the laying down of the Expiatory Rite for such transgression would be wholly superfluous. In accordance with our theory, on the other hand, inasmuch as the beginning as well as the completion of the Darça Purnamasa is laid down for every month during the lifetime of the performer,it is possible that there may be transgression of that particular day of the month omis sion of the performance on that day and hence too it would be quite possible for the transgressor to perform the expiatory rite after that date has elapsed.
nanu pūrvapaścepi pra timāsamabhyāsābhyupagamāt tadatikramanimittaprāyaścitta vidhānaṃ bhaviṣyati/	Objection According to the Purvapaksha also, inasmuch as the performance has to be repeated every month, and as there is every possibility of one missing the repetition in any one month,it would be possible for him to perform the expiatory rite after that month has passed.

darśapūrṇamā māviṣṭveti pūrveṇaiva nyāyenāśeṣābhyāmanirvṛtyuttarakālaṃ somayāgaḥ syāt /	Objection The words Purnamāsī and Amāvāsyā in the sen tence quoted, denote the particular times and as the time would apper tain to the constituent Repetitions, a transgression of these would be the transgression of the Purnamāsī and the Amāvāsyā, which would be the proper occasion for the Expiatory Rite.
na ca mṛtenāsau kartuṃ śakyaḥ anityatvāttu naivaṃ syāt	S Reply This is not possible because the transgression is always of that which is transgressed and the Time, by itself, could never be trans gressed because what the original Injunction lays down is not the non transgression of Time and by transgression is meant the neglect of that which has been laid down as not to be transgressed and as a matter of fact, we we find t that what is laid down is not the Time as not to be transgressed by the Action, but the Action as not to be transgressed by the Time and thus the Time is subservient to the Action, and not the Action to the Time and hence it is the Action that becomes complete or incomplete by the presence or absence of the Time and not vice versa and as something to be performed, it is the Action alone that could be transgressed or not transgressed, and not the Time because Time is a selfsufficient entity.
yadetanmuṃktakamabhihitametadeva sūtrārūḍhaṃ karoti /	Sutra We have a text that speaks of the completion of the Action.
niyamapo hyetadevaṃ syāt /	If there is time, the performances of the Action should be distinct.
athavā yāvajjīvaśabdena kāle guhyamāṇe lakṣaṇādoṣa uktaḥ tamabhyupetyābhidhīyate satyāmapi cakṣaṇāyāmanityatvāt naivaṃ syāt /	We have the sentence Darçapūrṇamāsābhyāmishtva somena yajetā. Now, if all the lifelong repetitions were to constitute a single perform ance of the DarçaPurnamasa, then, for reasons shown above, the Somasacrifice would have to be performed only after all the Repetitions had been finished and as these would be finished only after the death of the performer the dead person could not perform the Somasacrifice. If, on the other hand, there is time for the performance of the Soma sacrifice after the completion of the DarçaPurnamasa, then, in that case, the whole lifetime could not have been filled up by the performance of that DarçaPurnamāsa.
na ca sarvaprāṇabhṛtāmeva jīvanaparisamāptiryataḥ kutaścit vyavasthita svarūpā yayā kālo lacyeta, tadetadevamāpadyate yadaivedaṃ bhavati tataścānityatvānnimittamevaitaditi siddham / kathaṃ tarhi niyatanimittatvānnityamityucyate yāvaṣkarīrabhāvitvābhiprāyametadityadoṣaḥ	This nonfilling up of the whole lifetime is A found to be possible, only if the lifetime is taken as a property of the Performer because, in that case, each monthly performance of the DarçaPurnamāsa is a distinct action by itself. Thus then the latter part of the Sutra means that if there is time left by the performance of the DarçaPurṇamāsa, for the performance of the Somasacrifice, then each performance of the DarçaPurnamāsa should be a distinct action, as held by us. The latter part of the Sutra is also capable of another interpretation If the whole lifetime be laid down as the time for the performance of the DarçaPurnamasa, then the Somasacrifice, as well as all other actions that may be laid down for the man, would be performed in the midst of the DarçaPurnamāsa and in that case, inasmuch as all these other Actions would break up the continuity of the lifelong extensive Darça Purnamasa, the assertion Darçapūrṇamāsābhyāmishṭvā Having per formed the DarçaPurnamāsa would be wholly incompatible and further, this interruption of the DarçaPurnamāsa would constitute the improper procedure deprecated in such sentences as he falls off from heaven, who perverts the sacrifice and the like.
kartustaddha maniya mātkālaśāstraṃ ni mittaṃ syāt	For these reasons also we cannot take the sentence in question as laying down the time.
kartṛdharmapane yadidaṃ tvadabhimataṃ yāvajjīvamiti kānaśāstra midaṃ nimittaṃ bhaviṣyatītyetāvatsūtram / yattu bhāṣyakāraṇa vyapavargadarśanamuktaṃ tadyadi darśapūrṇamāsāvitadevā bhipretaṃ tataḥ punarukta, mathānyattadapyandā tatvānna jñāyate / tenānantarājonayaivaṃ yojayitavyam /	Goog is The Bhashya proceeds to quote two sentences, which really pertained to the foregoing Sutra One of these isAhitagnirva Esha yah Agnihotram juhoti na Darçapūrṇamāsau yajētā yā āhutibhäjo Devatāstā anudhyāyiniḥ karoti. This sentence is an Arthavada, having the character of a Repen tance, relating to another Injunction, in connection with the fact of the giving of gifts, etc., being prohibited for one who has been initiated for a S sacrifice and the sense of the sentence is that when he fails to offer their portions to the AgnihotraDeities, for a certain time, he makes them pine for the offerings and this pining could be possible, only when the Lifetime were the restriction imposed upon the performer.
tvatpace vikṛtīnāmavyapavargaḥ syāt matyace tu tāmāṃ vyapavargadarśana siddhānta upapatsyate /	Other wise, if the time were taken as the time enjoined for the Agnihotra, then its performance becoming optional, the offerings would not be necessary and as such there would be no reason for the Deities pining for them.
atha vā nigamanasametaditi vyākhyeyam /	For this reason too we must take the sentence in question to be a restric tive injunction Another sentence quoted by the Bhashya isJarāmaryam vā ētat satram yadagnihotram DarçaPurnamāsau ca, Jarayà ha vā ētābhyām nirmucyate mrtyuna ca.
athavā sūtrakāreṇa kartṛdharmo niyamoyamityuktam /	Sutra Because of the nonbinding character of the Action according to you, it could not be so.
yāvajjovaśabdamya tu kā gatiriti nābhihitamata āī / evaṃ sati kānaśāstrameva nimittaṃ syāt / athavā 'gnihotre darśapūrṇamāsayostāvat yāvajjīvagrahaṇāt kartṛdharmaniyamatvaṃ bhavet paśusomacāturmāsye tu katham /	That is to say, that alone can be spoken of as pointing to a definite point of time, which is sure to appear, and always in connection with that point of time as for instance, the Amāvāsyā is pointed out as the day on which the Moon is not visible but there is no such single thing that invariably marks the end of the lifetime of all living beings and hence this lifetime is not capable of being definitely pointed out by means of anything thus then the time lifetime being wholly indefinite being ascertainable only when it actually happens, it must be taken as mentioned by way of an occasion for the performance of the Agnihotra,etc. Question When the performance of the Agnihotra, etc., depends upon such an occasion, how can you speak of them as eternally necessary or binding ? ka The reply is that eternality in this case refers only to the con tinuance of the mans body.
taducyate /	Sutra Because of contradictions, as before.
tatrāpi vīmāyukta kānaśāstrameva nimittaṃ syā, dvamante vamante jyotiṣetyādi /	Sutra If the Restriction pertain to the performer, the Timeinjunction would be the occasion. The sense of the Sutra is that in accordance with the theory that lifelong is a property of the Performer, the word yavajjivam, which you hold to be the Injunction of time, would become the occasion for the performance.
na tāvadetata kāmyamyopadiśyate /	The Bhashya speaks of our finding a mention of the completion of the Action.
sahi yāvadicchamaṅgatvenaiva sthitatvāt naivaṃ vaktuṃ śakyate / athāpi naiyamikasya sakuprayogaḥ syātatrāpi vīmānarthikā bhavet /	But if what is meant by this is the sentence DarçaPūrṇamāsa bhyamishṭvā, etc., then it is a useless repetition of what has been already explained under Sutra . If, on the other hand, it refers to some other sentence, inasmuch as he does not quote it, what he says cannot be quite intelligible. Consequently, in view of what follows, we must take the Bhashya to mean that, in accordance with the Purvapaksha, there would be a non completion of the subsidiaries also during the lifetime, while, according to the Siddhanta, their completion is found to be quite possible.
na ca vasanteyattāvadhāraṇāpramāṇamasti /	Or, the Sutra may be taken as recapitulating what has been said before and as such there can be no incongruity in Repetition.
saptamyapi ca bhinne jonatyādivat nimittārthā bhaviṣyati, tenocyate sarvatraivajātīyaka kartṛdharmaniyamāvadhāraṇātkālaśāsvaṃ nimitta māstraṃ pratyetavyam / etenaiva paśucāturmāsyādiṣvapi naiyamikatvasiddhiḥ śākhāntare yathā karma kuttrarūpaṃ pratīyate /	Or, it may be that though the Author of the Sutra has already said that the Restriction in question is a property of the Performer,yet he has not yet shown what, in that case, would be done with the word Entre pa e V T CR yavajjivam and hence he now declares that that word can be taken as mentioning the occasion. M Or it may be that the Sutra replies to the questionIn regard to the Agnihotra and the DarçaPurnamāsa, inasmuch as we have the men tion of the word yāvajjīvam, we could take lifelong as the occasion but how can that be the occasion for the Animal sacrifice, the Soma sacrifice and the Caturmāsya sacrifice ? The sense of the Sutra thus is that even in the case of these latter, the prescription of time, mentioned repeatedly, would serve to point out the lifetime as the occasion the said prescription being in the form of the sentence vasantē vasantē jyo tisha,etc. This sentence does not lay down the time for the performance of any optional sacrifice because an optional sacrifice, depending for its performance upon ones whim, and as such being only subsidiary, it could not be spoken of as to be performed in every spring. Then as for the Necessary Binding Sacrifice, if that were to be performed but once, in any one spring, the repetition of vasante would be wholly useless.
kiṃcidguṇa samāmnānāncaivaṃ vedāntareṣu tat	Nor is there any ground for limiting its performance to only a certain number of springs.
dvitīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	Thus it is too that the necessary and binding character of the Animal sacrifice, the Soma sacrifice and the Caturmasya sacrifice becomes established.
pṛṣṭhadayavikapaḥ syān śākhāntara vidhānataḥ / ma ca prakṛtitaḥ prāptaḥ karmaikatve vṛthā bhavet	Sutra When the texts belong to distinct Rescensions, the Actions must be distinct because of differences in the name, the form, and the particular details and because of Repetition, Deprecation, Incapability, Mention of Completion, Expiatory Rites, and Distinct Purposes. The present Adhikarana is taken up with a view to show that there are no grounds for the differentiation of Actions except those already dealt with.
ekaṃ vā saṃyogarūpacodanākhyāvi śeṣāt sarvaca pratyabhijñānāt saṃcārūpagupyādibhiḥ /	And hence we proceed to bring forward certain other grounds of difference, and then demolish them and we shall also show, in course of the discussion, that every one of the grounds herein mentioned is included in one of those that have been already dealt with in the previous Adhi karanas.
ekakarmatvavijñānaṃ na bhākhākhapagacchati	But this is not correct.
svādhyāyagrahaṇenaikā śākhā hi parigṛhyate / ekārthānāṃ vikalpaśca karmaikatve bhaviṣyati	Because in the case of two Rescensions of the same Veda, we find that the Action mentioned in them is always in each in its entire form while this is not the case with other Vedas the Sama and the rest, which mention only slight details in connection with Actions whose form naturally is believed to be just as it is laid down in the YajurVeda.
yujyate karmanānātvāt naika mākhopanakṣaṇam	That is to say, in a case where no Action is laid down, independently of the other, it is capable of being cognized as a distinct Action.
na vā 'nādīni bhidyante karmāṇyādimatā satā yadyapi kāṭhakāderjāternityatvānnityaivākhyā tathāpi pravacananimitteyaṃ smaryate / na ca karmāṇi procyante śabdaviṣayatvāt pravacanasya / tasmādapi na saṃjñayā karmabheda iti ekatvepi param	As for instance, in every one of the several Rescensional texts of the Yajurveda, we find the mention of all such sacrifices as the DarçaPurnamāsa, the of Material, Jyotishtoma and the like, together with all other details Accessory, etc., the mention in each text being independent of that in the other and hence in such cases there is every likelihood of the various Jyotishtomas being distinct from one another. It is not so in the case of two different Vedas as, for instance, we find that what the Samaveda does, with regard to these sacrifices, is to mention them simply by name, without making any mention of their Deities or Materials, and then to lay down the particular Samas and Hymns to be sung at them.
tāṃbandhihārabhedānabhyupagamāt / tasmādekasmiva karmaṇi sādhanavikalpo bhaviṣyati / nanu cotpattivākyaśiṣṭatvāddikalpo nāstītyuktaṃ naiṣa doṣaḥ /	And in this case we find that these are not found to be wholly independent of their mention in the Yajurveda because, as mentioned in the Samaveda, they are devoid even of such apparently necessary details as those of Deities and Materials for which they cannot but depend upon the Yajurveda. While conversely that which is laid down in the Samaveda, with all its details of Deity and Material, is found to be mentioned in the Yujurveda, only in connection with certain accessory details and thus in this case it is the latter that stands in need of the former.
ubhayorutpattivākya śiṣṭatvāviśeṣeṇa tulyabalatvāt / kathaṃ punaraneka vākyotpādita syaikatvaṃ vijñāyataiti tasyottarasūtre pa ricāraṃ vakṣyāmaḥ / āgneyavatpunarvacanam	that The Action mentioned in each Rescensional text is distinct is to say, the Agnihotra mentioned in the Katha Rescension is distinct from the Agnihotra mentioned in the Taittiriya Rescension for the following reasons Taniya Recension On account of the Difference of Name fi., we find people declaring that such and such a thing is found mentioned in connection with the Kathaka Agnihotra, and that in connection with the Taittiriya Agnihotra which shows that the two Agnihotras are distinct, one being called the Kathaka and another the Taittiriya. C On account of the Difference of Form f.i., in one text the Cake dedicated to AgniSoma is said to be ekādaçakapāla, while in another it is said to be dvādaçakapāla.
anubhāṣaṇasūcametat /	On account of the perception of distinct purposes being served.
atha vā punaruktatva paricārārtha me vai mat /	Because if there were such another text, what wwww<< would be the use of deprecating the one, and laying down and praising the other.
punaḥ amerarthavādaguṇārthatvenānyathītvāt /	Though this case is exactly similar to a, yet we speak of it separately, because the Siddhanta meets this in a totally different manner.
advirvacanaṃ vā śrutisaṃyogāvi śeṣāt	The sense of the phrase in all Brāhmaṇas is that the same is the case even when the Action appears in the various Brahmanas of the same Veda.
disīyavyāyāne parivārāntaranivṛttyathe/ vābhandaḥ/	By Injunction is meant that which partakes of the Rootmeaning as well as the Bhavana And lastly, by Name are meant Jyotishtoma and the like, which are found to be exactly the same in all Texts.
tacānyārthā punaḥnirbhavati yatra bāvanmātrameva śrūyate /	But this is possible only in the case of a single Rescensional Text because the whole of this Text is read by the person.
na lie tadekamapi, samastetikataṃvyatopeta pradhānapunaḥ śrutiśravaṇāt /	Objection In that case, one could not read various Vedas. Reply Not so because there are other Vedic Injunctions laying down the study of various Vedas which would serve as exceptions to the general Injunction svadhyayodhyetavyaḥ.
etameva śrutisaṃyogāvi hinīvāṇyāpaśya caturtha pāda /	Such injunctions, among others, are anayā trayyā vidyaya,etc. By means of the knowledge of the Three Vedas, and ‘vēdānadhitya vēdau vā,etc. Having read the three, or the two Vedas .
śeṣaṃ manyate /	The various Brāhmaṇas too, belonging to the same Rescen sional Text, are taken conjointly, simply on account of their being dependent upon one another.
na caiṣā punaḥśrutiḥ /	That is both of these are equally un allowable.
śākhānā yugapattenaṃ punaḥ śrutikalpanā / na hi tatraikamākhāvat krameṇādhyayanaṃ sthitam	For these reasons we conclude that it is the same Action mentioned in the various texts. Sutra Mere names could not establish difference, because the names are of the Veda itself not of the Action. Even if Kathaka, Kalapaka were the names of Actions, then too, inasmuch as these do not occur in the originative Injunctions of the Actions, they could not serve to distinguish one action from the another.
saṃpradāyāgatāṃ mukkā khāṃ samāyānibandhinīm /	of Actions and the Reason oneness of Name, yet the Siddhanti has purposely brought forward a faulty argument, as a proper reply to the Purvapaksha, which is based upon fallacious arguments, through and through because a faulty rejoinder is always allowable against faulty arguments.
śākhā śākhāntaraṃ yuktaṃ nādhyetuṃ mahaśe śrame	Mere difference in such details as the number of Kapalas, cannot establish a difference between Actions because so long as there is absolutely no difference in the Kapala itself, that in its number is an insignificant detail.
dvitīyābhyāpapa caturtha pāda /	when the Repetition consists in another mention of the Action only, and when there are two objects of Injunction, in a single sentence.
pradhānānyapi prādhānyena yajamānaniyamaṃ pratyapramavantībhiḥ samāvyābhirarthamānamuddiśya vidhīyamānāni sarvaśākhāgatānyeka kaṃ puruṣamupatiṣṭhante /	In accordance with the law spoken of before, that one man can read the text of only one Rescension, one who has read of the Agnihotra men tioned in the text of the Katha Rescension, does not know of that which is mentioned in that of the Taittiriya Rescension or even if he happens to know it, inasmuch as he has all necessary knowledge of the Agnihotra from the text of his own Katha Rescension, he takes its mention in the other Rescension to be meant for those professing that Rescension and hence he does not look upon it as a mere fruitless repetition.
atha teṣāṃ vikalpenārthavattvaṃ tadaraṃ śākhāntarāṇāmeva vyavasthitapratipādyānāmanāṅavataraṃ parikalpitamityapunaruktatā / samāptivaca saṃprekṣā	Similarly does the professor of each particular Rescension treat of the texts of other Rescensions. And every one of these professors equally recognizes the Agnihotra as mentioned in a single text this is what is meant by the nondifference in the method of declaration . them that the Agnihotra is originally spoken of, and those found in the rest are mere repetitions. To this effect it has been declared elsewhere Inasmuch as all Rescensions have a simultaneous existence, no one of them can be looked upon as a repetition of the other specially as there is no order of sequence in which the various Rescensions are to be studied, as there is in the study of the various portions of a single Rescension.
arthāsaṃnniveśca	Sutra Because of the nonproximity of the purpose.
ekasya vedavṛcasya kiṃcitkarmaphantāśrayāt evaṃ śākhāḥ prasidhyanti bahubhākhekabudhavat /	The various texts are known as the Branches of the Vedatree, simply on account of their containing aining certain points of the same kind in the shape of Actions, just like the many branches of the same tree.
yadi pratibhākhaṃ karmabhedaḥ syāt asamāptivaditi vā chedaḥ /	b That is to say, if the Action mentioned in the various Rescensional Texts differed from one another, then, inasmuch as the very roots Actions would be distinct, on account of the fact of the flowers and fruitsin the shape of the results of Actionsbeing different from the very beginning, we would speak of the texts as distinct Vedas, and not as distinct Re scensions or Branches.
karmabhedapace yāvadeva yeṣāṃ mana ekamalābhāvādādita evārabhya bhidyamānatvāta samastakasamāmnānaṃ tāvadeva teṣāṃ samāpyataiti na brūyuratrāsmākaṃ na mapyapuṣpaphacāntaranbāt bujhāntaravat vedāntarāpayevocceran /	On the other hand, when the roots in the shape of Actions and the stems in the shape of Injunctions are the same, the only difference would be in the details of procedure, etc., which would be the difference in the number of fruits and flowers on the various branches of the tree and as such from the similarity of the tree, it is only right that the different texts should be spoken of as so many different Branches Rescensions. The sense would then be that, we take that to be a case of Repetition, where what has been spoken of once is approximate to the same man to whom it had been previously addressed. In the case in question, however, we find that that which is mentioned in one text is not approximate to the person professing a different Text. Sutra The Action in one text is not enjoined for one class of Brahmans only.
samāpyataiti /	Sutra Because of the mention of completion, samāpti may be read as asamāpti.
ancārohā nāma sthalārohaṇamantrāsteṣu maināna śākhāntarāṇi / ekakarmamūnā vidhiskandharūpatve samotikarmayaṇīyānāṃ samāpyate nāsmākamityabhighānādadhyetṝṣṇāmapi kavyatāyāḥ kacit kiṃ cidaṣikamityālocca sārūpyādupapatraḥ maikatvaṃ prasidvamityavamīyate	mentioned in various texts were dis tinct actions, then each of them would be completed, just as it would happen to be mentioned in its own text, and then we could not have such assertions as Our Agnihotra sacrifice does not end here this could be possible only when the speaker recognized the Agnihotra that is being per formed to be the same as that mentioned in his own text. The Anvarohas are the mantras in connenction with the sthalarohana, and it is with these that the sacrifice is finished by the professors of the Maitrayani Rescen sion but our sacrifice does not end there such assertions of the learners of Veda distinctly show that even studentsapart from the sacrificers recognise the Actions to be the same. Sutra Even when the Action is one and the same, the mention of Deprecation, Incapability, and Completion is quite explicable. All that the mutual deprecation of the offering being made before and after sunrise would show would be that the two times are optional alternatives.
eka kasaṃgatāḥ puṃsāṃ vikalpante vidhāyakāḥ / tatsamopasamāmnātaṃ grāhyaṃ prakaraṇasya ca śākhāntareṣu vikalpamāneṣu yayaiva pradhānaṃ vidhīyate 'rthinastadīyaḥ kathaṃbhāvastāmeva vyāpnoti na śākhāntarāṇi /	Similarly, as for the Incapability or Capability of Persons, it varies with each individual and it is equally uncertain, with regard to the Details laid down in all texts, as well as with regard to those men tioned in one text only i.e., there are men who are quite capable of duly carrying out all the minute details mentioned in all the various Texts, while there are others that are not capable of performing even those mentioned in one Text only and after all there is not much difference between the details mentioned in the various texts. het Some people, with a view to simplification, explain the sutra thus It is only those Injunctions of the other texts that are syntactically connected with the original Injunction which are taken as common to all men while those that are only related by the Context, could be taken as pertaining to the same Action come to be taken by men as optional alt alternatives while that which is simply mentioned in proximity to the sacrifice is taken up by the Context.
atavānyagatā guṇāḥ kathaṃbhāvena nāpekṣitāḥ prayogavacanenānupasaṃcatā nāṅgaṃ bhavantīti nānuṣṭheyā, stataśca vākyasaṃyuktānāmapatvādiṣīyamānānāmastyupasaṃharaṇaśaktiriti /	Thus then the accessories mentioned in other texts are not wanted in the method of that Action and as such not being referred to by the final Recapitulating Injunction, they do not become subsidiaries to that Action and consequently they are not performed along with it. And then, inasmuch as those connected with the original Injunction are very few, every performer will have the capability of taking the perform ance of these latter along with the Action.
na tvetadyuktamiva /	But this explanation does not appear to be quite proper.
tathā ci	The same may be said with regard to the different Rescensional Texts also.
karmadharmāścaite vijñāyante taca karma śākhāntareṣvapi tadevetyaṅgatvāviśeṣaḥ / yadyapi prakaraṇarūpamanyat tathāpi śākhāntarasthenānenaitepi dharmā gṛhītā ityavadhāraṇāt na svaprakaraṇagṛhītebhyo viśiṣyante /	All Details are known as qualifying or belong ing to Actions, and when the same Action is found to be mentioned in another text also, why should not the details belong to that also ? Even though the forms of the Contexts may be different, yet it is always ascertained that the details mentioned in this Context are taken up also by the same action mentioned in another text and as such there is no difference, on the score of applicability, between the details mentioned in the same Context, and those mentioned elsewhere.
sarvākhapi ca śākhākhadhika viṣayo na kathaṃ cit śākhayā parimitā bhavantītyalpa evāyāsa iti nāśaktiḥ / samāptivāṣītāpe cayo papannatvānna bhedaṃ kalpayati	And then inasmuch as the excess of Injunctions is not measured by the number of Rescensional Texts, it would not involve any very great effort to perform the details mentioned in all texts and as such, there can be no Incapability in this. As for the declaration of completion, or otherwise, that depends upon what the speaker may have learnt, and hence that does not establish a difference between Actions.
samāptiḥ pūrvavatvādyathājñāte pratīyate	Sutra the application of the Expiatory Rites would be controlled in accordance with the method started with.
atha yaduktamekādaśinyāṃ pacave disaṃmānadarśanaṃ na syādiনi/ tatra brūmaḥ anyathāpi tu naivāti panavedyādimānatā / ekādaśinyabhāvena stūyate tvekayūpatā	In all cases of alternative procedure, one can start with his perform ance, distinctly in accordance with one method of procedure only and hence, if subsequently he happens to leave off the details of that method, and takes up those of another, he commits a distinctly wrongful infringement and thereby renders himself liable to Expiatory Rites and thus the mere mention of Expiatory Rites does not necessarily show that any, or both, methods is objectionable or inacceptable by any performer Sutra Inasmuch as the completion depends upon what has gone before, we accept it in accordance with our own knowledge.
babhvavātika / guṇārthā vā punaḥ śrutiḥ	We have shown under Sutra , that the mention of completion is compatible with both the unity and diversity of Actions.
api vā kramasaṃyogāt vidhipṛthaktvamekasyāṃ vyavatiṣṭheta	But, inasmuch as the assertion of completion is always in accordance with what the speaker might know, it serves to establish the unity of actions and the reason for that assertion is that it is regulated by what has been done before in the beginning.
pratibhākhaṃ vā vidhipṛthaktvaṃ vyavatiṣṭheta /	BA Or, the sutra might mean that, inasmuch as all verbal usage depends upon its previous acceptance by people, we could conclude that the Completion spoken of is like what we actually find to be.
tathā sati hi kramabhedaṃ na yāsyanti svaśākhāvidhitāḥ kiyā, parimāṇaṃca maharti nānyatvaṃ pratipayate tenaiva gatatvādavācamiti cet ma sūtrakārasyācaiva prathamābhidhānāt	And as for this we often find that even when the Action has not been completed, as soon as the details mentioned in one text have all been performed, the professors of that text declare Our this sacrifice ends here and hence there is no incompatibility in this assertion with our theory. Sutra The indicative words are equally applicable to both of us because the mention of the Jyotishtoma as the very first to be performed pertains to all Rescensions nor does the text enjoin another Jyotishtoma therefore the Dvādaçãha would come to be called ahāra.
dvitopādhyāyasya caturthaḥ pāda /	The presence of the uninitiated sacrificers at the Dvādaçãha is equally incongruous, for both of us.
tasmāttadeveti matena karma bhinnaṃ kathaṃ cit pratibhākhamiṣṭam /	Because what the Tāṇḍaka lays down is the fact of the Jyotishṭoma mentioned in all texts being always the first to be performed.
na kāraṇaṃ saptamamasti cānyadato yathoktaiva tu bhedasiddhiḥ /	Nor does the Tanḍaka enjoin a distinct Jyotishțoma of its own with regard to which alone it would lay down that restriction.
iti mahakumārilakṛtau tantraṭīkāryā dvitīyādhyāyasya turīyacaraṇaḥ samāptaḥ samāptava dvitīyādhyāyaḥ /	Thus, then, the restriction applying to the Yajurvēdis also, and hence the said incongruity being found to be present in both theories, both of us should explain the clause in question as meaning that if the sacrificers happen to be initiated or not initiated for the Dvadaçãha.
athātaḥ śeṣalakṣaṇam	And hence on this point, there is no difference between our theories.
dvijavaṣyāḥ paraṃ śiṣṭaṃ yāvatkaṃcana caṇam /	P It has been argued above Bhashya, p. , line , et seq. that there could be no mention of the measuring of the Paksha and the Vedi if the Action were the same.
yattu śeṣaḥ para/rthatvādityanantaracaṇam / tatva vālādādī tanmābagocaram	That is to say, the sentence yat pakshasammitam,etc. appears in the wake of the Injunction there is but one post, and eleven animals and it means that, as at the Ēkādagini, there would be a deal of trouble, if any of the two measures mentioned were accepted, it is far better to have only one post.
samāmaya ḍedhā vigṛha iyorvākyārthayoḥ pradarśanīyaḥ	And as for the measuring by the paksha, as it is one that has never been enjoined, it must be taken as always appearing as a mere Description and the Injunction of the measuring by the Vedi also only serves as a praise, showing the superior excellences of a single sacrificial Post.
sarveṣāṃ di jahaṇāntarārthānāṃ prayojyāprayojya prayojakāprayojakaṣadvidhāmaniyamaphalavakarmaviṣayaka saṃdhikārarūpāppāṃ tāvadaṅgātmaka śeṣa viśeṣa prakāratvākaṇāntaragocarāṇāmapi śeṣana cappāntargatatvāvadhāraṇa sthitiḥ	And as for the measuring by the eyes of the chariot, it would be done at that sacrifice, in connection with which the Ekādaçinī is laid down and as such there would be no incompatibility. In the case in question, however, the measuring by the Vedi appears as the object of Injunction, by means of Praise and as such we cannot very well take it as eulo gising anything else.
kramopi śeṣa evekaprayogavacanāśrayaḥ /	Consequently it must be concluded that the measur ing by the paksha, which is not enjoined, is a mere description, for the sake of praising the measuring by the Vēdi.
vayati puruṣa karmārthatvāditi jaiminiḥ /	And as, in regard to the Agni sacrifice, this measuring by the Vēdi would be the most authoritative, on account of its being mentioned in the same Context, the Injunction of the measuring by the eyes of the chariot, being thus freed from the Primary Agni sacrifice, would betake itself to its subsidiaries.
tathā'nāmnāvaśeṣāṇāṃ śeṣiṇā saptamādibhiḥ / śeṣa sahāvatadrūpaparimāṇādinirṇayaḥ saptamenātideśena śeṣāḥ santoti sādhite /	One text lays down the holding of the shodaçī at the Atiratra while another prohibits it and hence its holding or not holding being both optional, when it is not held, there would be an excess of two hymns only when however it is held, the excess comes to be three, because in this latter case, there are two Rik Verses added to the group of twentyone, and in this way we do not find any contradiction between the texts concerned.
prayogaparimāṇaṃ ca tattantrāvāpalakṣaṇam /	Sutra In the Sarasvata, on account of the prohibition, we would take the sentence with the conditional if.
māthaśavda ānantaryapūrva prakṛtāpeścādhikārāṇāmekaṃ sarvā gvā vivacitvā prayujyate / prāguktabheda caṇānasaroktatvām pūrvaprakkṛtamapejya śeṣalakṣaṇamārabhyate / kuta iti detyapekṣāyāmata iti hetuvyapadeśaḥ /	As in r regard to the Sarasvata sacrifice, just as in the case of the Dvadaçaha shown above, the previous performance of the Jyotishtoma would be found necessary for both of us disputants, both of us should explain the sentence concerned as follows If, in the case of the perfor mance falling in the bright fortnight of the month ending with Paurṇamāsī, the sacrificers happen to be Puroḍāçins, then they should fast whereas if, in the case of the performance falling within the dark fortnight ending with Amavasyā, the sacrificers happen to be Sannayyins, they should remove the calves.
yasmādbhedama vijñāya na śakyaṃ śeṣancakṣaṇam /	And in this way, we find that the mention of different sacrificers Purodāçins and Sannayyins indicates the different times of the performance, and as such there is no incompatibility.
vijñātumata etasya tadanantaramucyate bhinnānāṃ hi padārthānāṃ śeṣaśeṣitva saṃbhavaḥ /	Sutra As for the contradictions involved in regard to the Upahavya, The sutra may be taken as recalling a previous argument of the Purvapaksha, or as embodying its refutation, in general terms. Sutra the repetition would serve the purpose of showing another accessory.
ekave nāpadiśyeta kaḥ śeṣaḥ kasya śeṣiṇaḥ /	O even if we accept this latter expounding only, then, too, there is no much difference in the sense of the sutra.
bhedānantaravaktavyaṃ śeṣaṇakṣaṇameva ca / prayojakakamādīnāṃ śeṣatvādhīnacintanāsa / ayameva ca savandhaḥ saṃmatodhyāyayoīyo /	For, in that case, the wor Çëshalakshanam meaning the definition of auxiliary character, it is a parts of this definition that the other subjects are dealt with in th subsequent Adhyāyas. That is to say, all the subjects dealt with in the subsequent Adhyaya viz., the question of the Instigator and the Instigated iv, the six mean of ascertaining the order of sequence v, the capability or title to tli performance of certain sacrifices vi, etc., etc.all are particular feature relative to auxiliaries and as such, even though they happen to b dealt with in other Adhyayas, they are spoken of as included in th Definition of Çesha or Auxiliary.
mammin ci saṃti sūmokte nānyo bhāṣyakṛtoditaḥ	As for the other Adhyayas we find each of them prefaced by an independent sutra.
arthadvārohyadhyāyādisaṃbandho na granthasvarūpāśraya iti saṃ cepoktipiṇḍokṛta vṛttavartiṣyamāṇādhyāyārthapradarśanapūrva bhā ghyakāreṇaiva saṃbandhaḥ pūrvādhyāyayorabhihitaḥ /	II was different the first sutra of that Adhyâya did not point out any connection with the preceding Adhyaya consequently, in that place, we had the Bhashya explaining the connection in detail, in the sentences Pra thumë Adhyaye, etc.,etc. As a matter of fact, we find that the Adhyayas are related in the subjects that they treat of, and not in the mere verbal form of the texts and hence the Bhashya took the trouble of explaining the connection between Adhyāyas I and II, after having shown in brief what had gone in the preceding Adhyaya, and what was coming in the one just then begun.
iha tu sūcakāreṇaivāthātaḥ śabdābhyāmupanibaddha iti sa eva vyākhyātaḥ /	And in this sentence, the Bhashya has spoken of Difference alone, as forming the principal factor in the question dealt with in Adh.
nānākarmalakṣaṇaṃ vṛttamiti ca	II,and it does not make any mention of the other supplementary matters therein dealt with,because it is the Difference of Actions alone that helps in the explanation of Auxiliary character.

II the Bhashya has spoken of in detail of every question dealt with in the preceding Adhyāya, is that due ascertainment of the Difference of Actions depends upon every one of the details dealt with in the First Adhyāya, which deals with the Means of knowing Dharma, duly divided into Injunctions, Valedictory Pas sages, Mantras, Smrtiregulations, Injunctions of accessories, Names, and the Ascertainment of doubtful points by means of subsequent sentences and the character of the purpose served. For instance, in the ‘Abhyāsādhikaraṇa, we have the assertion aviçëshādanarthakam hi syat in Sūtra IIii, on the sole strength of the previous definition of the Veda as the means of knowing Dharma.
tathārthavādavijñānādviṣvādiguṇakā khayaḥ / yāgā na kalpitāsteṣāṃ vidhiśaktarasaṃbhavāt	That is to say, we find these sentences, occurring in the midst of the mention of the anomaly of Jāmi interruption, having the character of valedictory passages, on account of their forming part of the intermediate Injune tion and as such having no independent injunctive potency, they are not taken as laying down three distinct sacrifices with Vishnu, etc., as their deities.
mantrāṇāmapi yatkāryaṃ vicitārthaprakāśanam / tantravārtika / tena godānagoyāgau nābhyāsādbhedamāganī tathā śabdārthaṃ saṃbandha smṛtitattvāvadhāraṇāt /	Inasmuch as the mantras serve the purpose of indicating things relative to what has been enjoined, the Godana and the Goyajña are not taken as distinct actions, on the sole ground of repetition. That is to say, the mantras have their injunctive potency suppressed by such causes as the presence of the word yat, words of address, the First Person, and so forth and hence even though they are spoken of as the means of accomplishing Dharma, yet they do not serve to point out one action as being different from another, even in the case of such mantras as Devänçca yābhiryajatë dadâti ca, etc., where we have various verbs.
prakṣepādhikatāmātrādyāgādbomasya bhinnatā	It is through the due ascertainment of the bearing of the grammatical rules dealing with the significations of words, that we come to accept the difference of Homa from Yaga, on the ground.
kṛtakaṃ cābhidhānaṃ yadanyairā dimaducyate /	of the former involving a further action of throwing in. Similarly also, the Actions are not differentiated by such names as kathaka and the like, simply because grammatical rules distinctly make these the names of books, for certain reasons therein mentioned.
tenānuṣṭhitamityevaṃ yadi nāma smṛtirbhavet /	Though the fact of such names being coined ones has been urged by some people as an argument against the eternality of words, yet the Author admits it so far as explaining it as based upon certain causes.
karma kāṭhakamucyetaṃ kaṭenānuṣṭhitaṃ hi yat	That is to say, the word kathaka means that which is taught by Katha, in accordance with the rule tona proktam and hence it is a book that is taught, and not the matter, which latter is only performed and thus, inasmuch as we have a grammatical rule distinctly laying down the nominal affix in kathaka as signifying that which is taught by Katha, we must take it as the name of a book, as it is a book alone that can be taught and explained.
guṇaścāpūrvasaṃyoge nāmadheyaṃ ca bhedakam /	Accessories with new relationships IIii, and Names also serve to differentiate Actions and hence a due knowledge of the character of the Accessory and the Name is necessary in the matter of the differentiation of Actions.
bhedopayogitā tena guṇānāmatvabodhayoḥ	II and hence it is this Difference alone that is spoken of in the Bhashya.
paśusaptadaśatvasya na yāgeyattayā vinā /	But this is not the only reason for the very brief reference, in the Bhishya, to the matter of the previous Adhyāya because, just as at the beginning of Adh.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	In the first sütru of Adh.
siddhirastīti cārthena siddhaḥ saṃdigdhanirṇayaḥ grāhyaṃ na tvetade kāntātsaṃ śepokti prayojanamaḥ/	, we have not taken the word alha an denoting Adhikara because what is mentioned in the sutra is the desire to know Dharma and this Desire is not what is found to be taken up for consideration consequently all that that sutra could be taken to mean was that we should now proceed to point out that which should be done immediately after the study of the Veda and after such study what is necessary to do is to have a desire for knowing Dharma.
yataḥ pūrvavadeveca prapañcopyupayocyate tathā ca pūrvabhedana karmabhedānusāriṇā / jyaiauṣadhādidharmāṇāṃ vyavasthāṃ sādhayiṣyati	Even though the knowledge of Dharma was also found mentioned therein, as qualifying that Desire, yet that knowledge would come by itself to the disciples, by the mere explanation of the meaning of the Veda and consequently, it could not be taken as a fit object to be mentioned, either by the sutra or the Bhashya or the later commentators, as befitting of consideration.
śruterjātādhikāra syādityasminnupayocyate evamarthadvaye tāvadatha śabdasya varṇitam / saṃbandhodhyāyayorukto yahā 'rthātmid eva saḥ	Specially as that which, in the assertion of the speaker, appears as an object deserving of consideration, cannot be expressed by the expression desire to know for one who hears that assertion. In the present case, on the other hand, we find that the Definition of Auxiliary character is quite capable of being explained as deserving of consideration, either in the shape of the Adhyāya, or in that of what is therein mentioned. The meaning of the sutra thus comes to be this Henceforth the Definition of the Auxiliary should be regarded as the object of consideration, and it should be carefully grasped and listened to.
vaktṛvākyagataṃ yattu syātkiṃ ciḍhadhikārabhāk / na jijñāsāpadaṃ tasya śrotuḥ svārthanirūpakam	Inasmuch as there is no room after what has been dealt with in Adh. II for any other Adhyâya, we can very reasonably speak of the Definition of Auxiliary as the object of consideration. Nor can there be any doubt as to the propriety of the consideration of Auxiliary character, on this occasion, in preference to any other subject because a due understanding of all that is said in the subsequent Adhyāyas depends upon a correct comprehension of the Auxiliary Character.
bhāro yo yena voḍhavyaḥ sa prāgātolito yada /	That is to say, the latter six Adhyāyas, dealing, as they do, of Implications as preceded by Direct Injunction, stand in need of the completion of the former six Adhyāyas, which treat of Injunction.
tadā kastasya voḍheti śakyaṃ kartṛnirūpaṇam	So also, the Capability of Performance dealt with in the sixth Adhyaya is ascertained as existing in the Performer, in the shape of his power to perform the Action in the way that it is enjoined and as such, a treatment of this could not but follow after a due comprehension of all Injunctions, up to the order of sequence of the actions to be performed dealt with in Adh.
prayojakopi śeṣāṇāṃ śeṣyanyastvaprayojakaḥ /	V as it is only when the weight to be carried has been duly ascertained beforehand, that we could ascertain whether a certain person is capable of carrying it.
kariṣyate parā tasmāttaccintā śeṣalakṣaṇāta	Then again, it is the Principal by anything else and hence it is only right that we should treat of the character of the Instigator after that of the Auxiliary has been fully dealt with.
svarūpa he tusaṃbandhatatpramāṇabajāvalaiḥ / nanu jñeyā yathā śeṣāḥ śeṣiṇopi tathaiva naḥ	Thus then, the propriety of the taking up of the Definition of Auxiliary having been fully established, the Bhashya proceeds to show that there are various ways in which the Auxiliary can be defined,these ways consisting of the due treatment of the Form, the Cause, and the Relationship of the Auxiliaries, also with the comparative strength and weakness of the means whereby they are recognized.
jñātavyā ubhaye satyaṃ sūtraṇīyā na tubhaye / arthāpatyā hi sidhyanti dvitīyā ekanna pāt	Objection It is as necessary to know the Principals as the Auxiliaries because so long as any one of these is unknown, there can be no performance. Reply It is true that both should be duly known but it is not necessary to speak of both in the sutra because the definition of one would necessarily imply that of the other.
prādhānyāccheṣiṇāṃ sājhādyuktaṃ vā śeṣignadakṣaṇam / na tu tatkriyate tatra kartavyaṃ hi iyaṃ bhavet tenopasarjanamyāpi śetrasyaiveha lakṣaṇam / kriyate śeṣiṇastvarthāttajjñānenaiva sekyati śrutyādimāyecavacyate yadvannāvalam /	Then there remains the question as to whether the sutras should deal directly with the Principals or with the Auxiliaries from the fact of the treatment of both being equally difficult, and leading practically to the same result, it would seem as if the matter were altogether optional in fact at first sight, it would appear more reasonable that the treatment should be of the Principals, because they form the chief factor but still this is not what is done and the reason is that if the sutra began with the definition of the Principal, it would be necessary for it to mention that of the Auxiliary also because the Principal Çeshi is explained as that which has many Auxiliaries Çēshas and hence the character of the former could not be comprehended without a due comprehension of the latter consequently even though the Auxiliary is the subordinate factor, yet it is of this that the sutra gives the definition specially as that of the Principal follows from that and does not require a separate mention.
taca kaḥ śeṣa iti svarūpābhidhānapratijñā /	Another reason for this is that Direct Assertion, Indicative Power and the rest, all tend to ascertain the character of the Auxiliary and it is as a necessary concomitant of this that the Principal becomes indirectly defined as that which has that Auxiliary.
tasya ca kārakakṣetosta irmasyaiva lakṣaṇaṃ vaccataiti pratijñāyate	It is for these reasons that the present sütra lays down the subject to be dealt with as the Definition of the Auxiliary, together with all the various means of ascertaining that character.
tṛtīyapadā tadeva pramāṇa yamupanyasya upakramopasaṃhāradārega ekavākyatvena sidvāntasthāpanāt vināpi vākyagrahaṇena prāyadarśanāditi vākyaviniyogamutkā prakaraṇakrama samākhyābhirviniyogaḥ sūtropanibaddha eva vakṣyate/	Why is it an Auxiliary? is to say, we shall explain that character of the Auxiliary which resas in to call it an Auxiliary. Which is the Auxiliary of which Principal ? That is to say, we shall explain the process of performance, by which the Auxiliary is attached to one Principal and not to the other, this conclusion either involving, or not involving, the indicative power of one or the other means of ascertaining such character and in this connection we shall explain the form of these six meansDirect Assertion and the rest, as also their comparative strength and weakness. Thus then, in the First Päda, we shall treat of the applicability of Auxiliaries as shown by Direct Assertion as also of certain other matters connected with it. In the Second Pada, we shall treat of the applicability shown by the Indirect Indication of words.
tato bannāvalādhikaraṇam /	After that will follow the Adhikarana dealing with the comparative strength of these six authorities.
tataḥ paraṃ ca śrutiniṅgavākyānāṃ prakaraṇe maha viro dhāvirodhacintā tāvadyāvatyaḥ sarveṣāṃ paśuvidhiriti	m It is these matters to be dealt with that are referred to in the Bhashya etat tatparyena,etc. The purpose served by this brief reference to what is to follow makes it more easily comprehensible. Inasmuch as the definition of the Principal would follow from that of the Auxiliary, we have in the sutra a definition of the latter only. And inasmuch as the Çesha has many significationsThat which exceeds, etc., etc.,the sutra distinctly mentions a reason because it is for the sake of another which shows that the word is here used as synonymous with such words as Añga, Guna, Dharma and the like.
śeṣalagamā coktāvaryādayā cheṣilakṣaṇam /	The sense of the first is this That which does not appear with out another, and which appears when that other appears, is its Auxiliary e.g., the sprout does not appear without moisture, and the jar without the Clay, the Rod, the Wheel, etc., and hence these are known as Auxili aries to those two.
ataḥ śeṣaḥ parārthatvādityuktaṃ śeṣanāṇām	Against this wo have the following reasons It is not proper to regard the Auxiliary as the Invariable Concomitant because this definition would be too wide inasmuch as we find even such things to be so concomitant as are not Auxiliaries as for instance, the qualities of Colour, Touch, etc., are always Concomitant in Earth and certainly none of these is Auxiliary to any other, all of them being equally predominant. Master is never known as Auxiliary to them.
yaccānyada vinābhāvaprayojyatvādikāraṇam /	Similarly Primaries and Subsidiaries, as also a number of Subsidiaries, would become mutual Auxiliaries, if the charac ter of the Auxiliary consisted of Invariable Concomitance only.
taca sarvaṃ nirākartuṃ pārārthyamiha gṛhyate	Then again, Vedic Study, Laying of Fire, Agriculture, and Earning of Wealth, etc., would all have to be taken as Auxiliaries to Sacrifices, as no perfor mance of sacrifices is ever possible without these. In view of these objections, the upholder of the second theory argues thus Irrespective of Invariable Concomitance, we must admit that to be the Auxiliary which is instigated by another.
na śeṣo 'nyaḥ parārthatvānna ca hetvantareṇa maḥ /	This saves us from the above objections, as neither the Master is instigated by the Slaves, nor is there any mutual instigation among Colour,etc. But this too cannot be accepted as the correct definition of the Auxiliary because the definition is too wide, as well as too narrow.
anyonyaniyamenaiva pacahetvoḥ parigrahaḥ tadbhāvabhāvitvena tāvadyo yena vinā na bhavati sa tasya śeṣaḥ / tadyathāṅkurastoyādibhirvinā na bhavati / ghaṭaśca mṛtpiṇḍa ḍha ṇḍacakrādibhiriti tayostāni śeṣatvena jñāyante /	For instance, the Puroḍāçakapāla is not instigated by the Removal of the Chaff, because it is an established entity already and yet it is accepted as its Auxiliary and on the other hand, though the Ilomas are actually instigated by such causes as the breaking of the vessel, the des truction of the Cake, etc., yet they are not accepted as Auxiliaries to these. Then we have the third theory, as follows That which is found to be enjoined, in excess of something already enjoined, is the Auxiliary to this latter and thus the character of the Auxiliary consists of being an Excess.
sarvadā hyavinābhūtā rūpasparśādayaḥ citau /	For instance, in all cases we find that the Injunctions of the Subsidiaries are over and above those of the Fruitful Primary and the Subsidiaries also are something over and above the Primaries and in all these cases we find the character of the Auxiliary consisting in Excess.
na caiṣāṃ tulyakalpatvādbhavatyanyonyaśeṣatā /	Against this it may be argued that this definition also is too wide as it applies to the Primaries also because the Primaries are as much in excess of the Subsidiaries, as the Subsidiaries are in excess of the Prima ries and hence the definition is equally applicable to both.
kutaḥ siddhestuṣopavāpena śeṣastattasya ceṣyate /	Then, we have the fourth theory, which is as follows Inas much as we always find the Injunctions of Auxiliaries appearing after those of the Primaries, we must conclude the Auxiliary character to consist in this fact of being enjoined at the end of the Injunction.
tathā homāḥ prayujyante bhedana skandanādibhiḥ	In connection with the declaration that the modifications of sacrifices should be performed in the same way as their originals we find Jaimini also later on speaking of the Auxiliaries as being laid down at the end of Injunctions.
tasya taṃ prati śeṣatvamatirekeṇa lakṣyate / sarvacaiva phalavatpradhānavidheraṅgavidhayoṅgāni pradhānebhyo 'tiriccantaityetadevātirekalakṣaṇaṃ śeṣatvaṃ yuktamityukte 'bhi dhīyate	Consequently we must conclude that the character of the Auxiliary, accepted by Jaimini, consists in the fact of its being enjoined by the tailend of an Injunction, as capable of supply ing the details of procedure wanted in connection with the Primary enjoined at the beginning of that Injunction. To this theory we make the following reply we cannot admit this to be a correct definition of Auxiliary character because as a matter of fact, we actually find that character belonging to Actions laid down in the beginning, in the middle, as well as at the end of Injunctions.
yadi hi niyogato vākyaprakaraṇānteṣveva vyavasthitāḥ śeṣavidhayaḥ samāmnāyaran tata etadavyabhicāra lakṣaṇamā śrīyeta	That is to say, if in all cases we invariably found the Injunctions of Auxiliaries appearing at the tailend of the Sentences and the Context, then we could accept that as the universal mark of the Auxiliary but as a matter of fact we find them laid down in the begin ning, the middle as well as the end.
vidhyādivihitatvātte nāpnuyurdarśaśeṣatām	For instance, we find such details, as the chopping of branches, etc., laid down at the very beginning of the Primary Durça sacrifice and hence, according to your definition, they could not serve as the Auxiliaries of that sacrifice.
aṅgavidhyapakrameṣu tāvadvākya prakaraṇeṣu tadgata kiṃbhāvākā jitapra yojanakalpanāvelāyāṃ kathaṃbhāvākāṅgāyukta pradhānavidhidarśanāta tadapecitopakāra siddhārthatvena teṣāmavadhāryamāṇānāṃ vidhyādigatānāmapi śeṣatvamastīti na vidhyanta vidhānamevaikaṃ śeṣalakhaṇatvenāvakalpate	Then, we find, in many cases, the Material and the Deity laid down along with the sacrifice itself, and these too would not bo Auxiliaries, as not laid down at the end. Thus then, we conclude that we cannot accept the fact of being laid down at the tailend of Injunctions as the sole definition of the Auxiliary because we find that in many cases, where the sentence or the context begins with the laying down of Subsidiaries, when we come to look for the result to be accomplished by these subsidiaries, we come across the Injunction of the Primary Sacrifice, which stands in need of the men tion of its method of procedure and as this want of the Primary is supplied by the former Subsidiaries, these come to be taken as its Auxiliaries, even though they happen to be laid down at the beginning of the Injunction.
na hi bhinnopakārārthaḥ sa tayevopakārakam /	Then there remains the fifth theory, which may be thus summed up That should be accepted as the Auxiliary of another which is found to help it in this way the Homa cannot be the auxiliary of the Breaking of the Vessel,etc. because the Homa does not help the Break ing in fact it is the latter that helps the former.
vede ca nānyadaṅgatvakāraṇaṃ dṛśyate va cita tantravārtike /	In the Veda too we do not find any other cause of auxiliary character save this because unless one thing helped another, it could not be auxiliary to it.
tasmādapapatramidaṃ sakṣaṇamiti	Hence there is nothing incongruous in the definition we have given.
mādayaṃmapi naivānyaduprakārātpratīyate /	And in fact, the fact of being subordinate to anothers purpose also is nothing different from Help.
evaṃ sati pradhānānāmaṅgānāṃ ca parasparam /	But even this definition is not quite correct because in accordance with this definition, the Auxiliary character would be hopelessly mixed up among Primaries, among Subsidiaries, and also among the Subsi diaries of Subsidiaries.
yathaiva hyaṅgāni pradhānānāmupakurvanti tathaivānuṣṭhāpanenopakārapratigrahaṇācca pradhānānyapyaṅgānāmupakurvantyeva /	That is to say, just as the Subsidiaries help the Principals, so also do the Principals help the Subsidiaries by bringing about their performance, as also by accepting their aid and thereby justifying their performance. Because no one would perform the Subsidiaries, unless he were instigated to it by the requirements of the Principals and these Subsidiaries too could not afford any help unless there were something to be helped in the shape of the Principals.
pradhānānyapyatoṅgānāmaṅgāni sṭuranugrahāt / syādanyonyopakārācca teṣāmanyonyaśeṣatā tasmātparasparāṅgatvamupakārāt prasajyate /	And thus, on account of the help accorded by them, the Principals would also become subsidiary to the Subsidi aries and thus by mutual help, they would become mutual auxiliaries. Then again, in the case of sacrifices, whose performance consists of various Principals, a single Principal, without the others, could not accomplish the Result and hence they would help each other, in the bringing about of it and hence by mutual help, they would become mutual auxiliaries specially as this help does not in any way differ from that accorded by the Subsidiary to the Principal.
evamaṅgānāmapyanyonyāpādanaṃ darśayitavyam /	In the same way we could show the possibility of mutual help among the Subsidiaries themselves.
tataścaikapradhānavikāreve kāṅgagamanevi samastasāṅgapradhānagamanāda niyamaḥ prāpnoti	And thus, in the performance of the modifications of a single Principal, even if a single Subsidiary should come to be performed, it would necessitate the performance of all other Subsidiaries and Principals as its auxiliaries, and there could be no restriction in this matter.
jñātaṃ ca lakṣaṇaṃ sarvaṃ nakṣyaṃ jakṣayituṃ kṣamam /	Similarly, the Earning of Wealth, the Laying of Fire, and Vedic Study, etc., would come to be the auxiliaries of all actions because they help all of them by their various effects as certainly there is no action that can be accomplished without the help of these.
tatra dṛṣṭopakārāṇāṃ tatkṛtā śeṣatā bhavet anavagataśeṣatvāvastheṣūpakārādarśana/ sadadhīnāvadhāraṇaṃ śeṣatvaṃ na syāt /	Then again, it is only when the Definition or Character has become duly known that it can indicate the object to be defined. Consequently the Auxiliary character, based upon help, is possible only in such cases Rites, on the other hand, all of which help imperceptibly, such, for instance, as the Paryagnikarana and the like as also in the case of such subsidiaries as the Prayājas, which help the Principal DarçaPūrṇamāsa indirectly through their Apurvas,the auxiliary character of which Rites and Prayājas has not been cognized,as we would perceive no visible help accorded by them, they could never be known as Auxiliaries.
kalpitaupakāre bhaviṣyatīti cet na /	Nor can it be urged that the Auxiliary character of these would be recognized, by means of the assumption of some visible help.
prāgaṅgatvādupakārakapanāpramāṇābhāvāt /	Because prior to the recognition of the fact of their being Subsidiaries, there would be no ground for assuming any such helping.
yo hi yasya phalamya pha javato vā śeṣatvenāvadhārito bhavati ma kathaṃ tasyopakariṣyatītyapekṣite sati dvaṣṭamupakāramapaśyadbhiḥ tasmādadṛṣṭaḥ parikalagate /	As in a case where a certain thing having been recognized as auxiliary to an Action, with or without a Result, there arises the question as to the way in which it would help that Action and then alone can we, not finding a visiblo help, assume some sort of an unseeu help. And so long as the Auxiliary character has not been cognized, on what ground could the help be assumed? And in this way there would be a mutual interdependence. For instance, the auxiliary character would be cognized by means of the Help, and the Help again would be cognized by that of the Auxiliary character and none of the two would be cognized independently of the other. For the matter of that, even in the case of actions according percep tible help,e.g.
yāvattu śeṣatvameva nāvagamyate tāvatkena pramāṇe nāha ṭa kalpanā syāt	help following from the Restriction that the chaff is to be removed by threshing alone and hence the Auxiliary character would not be recognized as necessary.
na ca prāsaṅgikatvācchāstreṇopakāraḥ pratipādyataiti pratyābhirevopakāraṃ gṛhotvā śeṣatvaṃ gamyeta evametasminnapi pakṣe sarva tantraṃ vighaṭate /	M Then again, even in the case of such subsidiaries as are performed only by the way, and are not brought about directly by the Principal concerned, and in fact are performed for the sake of something totally different from it,inasmuch as they would help the other, they would become auxiliaries to that Principal also exactly like that which insti gates the performance of that Action in the midst of which that Action is performed. And this would be in direct contradiction to the Sūtras Präsangikañca notkarshet Sütra Vi, Prāsangikē prāyaçcittanna vidyatē Sūtra IXiv, nava patratvät,etc. Sutra IVi, ‘ Api vā cēshabhājām syāt Sūtra VIiv, etc.,etc. Thus we find that even Definition No.
tasmāducyate śeṣaḥ parārthatvāditi / akupoṣṭotadarthavyapaḍhe prabhāk /	And consequently we declare that the Auxiliary is that which is for the sake of another,etc. without finding any help accorded by it, if we find a certain Action to be done for the sake of another, we recognize it as its Auxiliary and after its auxiliary character has been recognized, it would naturally help it.
upakurvannapi tvanyastadathaṃiti nocyate	Question Is there any difference between helping and being for the sake of a thing? Answer Certainly, there is a difference because we often find that something that hinders another is also spoken of as being for its sake while that which helps it is not spoken of as such.
tadyathā maśakārtho dhūma ityapakā riṣyapi prayujyate / tathopakurvannapi prasaḍagya prayojakayorna tādayena vyapadiśyate /	That is to say, the mere fact of being done with reference to another is enough to make it spoken of as being for its sake and this is possible equally with that which helps and that which hinders. For instance, we speak of smoke as being done for the sake of mosquitoes though what the smoke does is to drive them away.
nanu copakāranirapekṣaṃ naiva sādathyeṃ śakyaṃ kalpayitum /	So also, even when we find one thing helping another, if it is found to be one that has come up by mere chance, and which is not found to have been done for its sake, it is not spoken of as being for its sake.
na hi prayājādayaḥ sāmīpyamāce ṇaivopakāra nirapekṣāstābṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	For instance, when a man drinks water out of a canal that has been dug out for the purpose of irrigating the fields of corn, he does not speak of it as having been dug for his sake. Consequently we conclude that being for anothers sake is something wholly different from helping it.
dathyeṃ pratipadyante /	Objection Then in that case even that which hinders would come to be an auxiliary.
tasmādupakārapūrvakameva tādarthyamiti sa eva śeṣatvakāraṇaṃ prāpnoti	That is to say, whenever a certain thing would be cognized as being for the sake of the sacrifice, there would be a doubt as to whether it will help or hinder it and then, inasmuch as the Principals do not stand in need of a hindrance, we would reject the possibility of the thing hindering the Action and on the strength of the said requirement of the sacrifice, we would take it to be a helper.
anyatrāpyupakāritvādapekṣāmācapūrvakam	Objection We can never take a thing as being for the sake of another, without knowing it as according some help to it.
nahājavagatāṅgatveṣu prayājādiṣūpakāradarśanaṃ kalpanaṃ cāstītyuktam /	For instance, it is not on account of mere proximity, and independently of the help that they accord, that the Prayājas are taken as being for the sake of the DarçaPurnamāsa.
ato darśapūrṇamāsayo rupakāramapekṣamāṇayoḥ prayājādiṣu copakāryamapeśamā jeṣvaniṣpannāvasthaevopakāre prakaraṇāttādathyaṃ tāvatpratoyate / tadanyathānupapattimāceṇopakāraka apanā	For instance, in the case of such sentences as Daçapavitrēņa graham sammārshti, Vrīhin prokshati, and the like, the fact of the actions therein mentioned being for the sake of the sacrifice is recognized beforehand, by the Direct Assertion of the sentences and then follows their recognition as subsi diaries, which leads to the assumption of the help to be accorded by them. Even in the case of the Prayajas, where there is no Direct Mention of their being for the sake of the DarçaPūrṇamāsa, though it appears as if the recognition of the Auxiliary character depended upon some Help accorded by them,yet, in reality, there too, it is based upon the requirements of the Principal as the Help is not accorded before the sacrifice is actually being performed.
nopakārādeva śeṣatvaṃ tādathyaṃ vetyanavadyam /	As we have already shown, that until the Auxiliary character of the Prayajas has been cognized, it is not possible either to perceive, or assume, the help accorded by them.
evaṃ ca sati śrutyādonyeva tādarthyapratipāṭanarūpeṇa śeṣasya viniyojakānīti tadvivekārthaṃ lakṣaṇamārabdhavyam/	Hence in the case of these we must admit the fact to be that the Durçu and the Pūrṇamāsa being found to stand in need of some help, and the Prayājas being found to be on the lookout for something that they could help, the latter come to be recognized by means of Context or Mutual Dependence, as being for the sake of the former two sacrifices, long before the help is actually accorded during the performance of the sacrifices.
cāṅgapradhānādīnāmupakārasaṃkara'tādarthyāda saṃkarasthitisiddhiḥ /	And as for the help it boing not perceptible, it is assumed simply for the purpose of justifying the recognition of their being for the sake of the sacrifices.
tasmātparārthatvalakṣaṇameva śeṣatvaṃ nirdoṣaṃ yaḥ parasyopakāre vartataiti pārāśarya mevākāraṇa phalenābhidhīyata ityaṣa gantavyaṃ na tvatrai khakṣaṇātibhrāntiḥ kartavyā	And hence even in this case we find that it is only the requirement of the sacrifices that brings about the inference of the fact of the Phayajas being for their sake and either this fact, or the Auxiliary character, does not quite depend upon the help accorded by them. And thus there is no incongruity in our theory. Such being the case, inasmuch as it is Direct Assertion and the rest alone that can establish the fact of something being for the sake of another, it is these alone that could lay down the performability of the Auxiliaries and as such, for a due discrimination of these, it becomes necessary to take up the present Adhyaya.
parastu tatrāpyupakārakatvāḍhatyeva kaścittādarthyaleśa iti pratyavatiṣṭhate	The opponent, however, thinks that even in the case of the Master and the Slave, the idea of being for anothers sake is based upon a certain help that is accorded, and hence urges the objection The Master also supports the Slave, and as such he would become subsidiary to him.
ata āha tatrāpūrthatā vyāvarttitati /	The reply to this is that in thus supporting the Slave, the Master is in reality helping himself.
tadabhidhīyate sarvaviṣayavyāpi śeṣatvam i i nabhyameva tatra nītamapūrvabha danirākaraṇārtham /	That is to say, the fact of being for anothers sake is known by that in view of which that thing is done and certainly the action of the Master is not with a view to help the Born Slave the fact being that he supports him, as this supporting is inseparably mixed up with the due fulfilment of his own ends and as such the Master is not known as the Auxiliary of the Slave.
athavā pūrvokta guṇapradhānabhāvalacamanapecyā pūrvavatsaṃprati kāraṇāntarānarāmena parārthatvalakṣaṇe śeṣatve tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Then, there arises an objection based upon the idea that the present sutra is a mere repetition of what has already been said under the Sutra IIi, the objection being this Inasmuch as the definition of the Auxiliary is already contained in the former sūtra, it was not necessary to mention it over again, in the present Adhyâya.” In reply to this we have the BhashyaTaträpūrvärthatä vyāvartitā. Some people explain this reply as follows In the previous sütra we have explained the Auxiliary character of such Actions as servo perceptible ends while on the present occasion, we explain that character as belonging to all Substances and Actious,those with porceptible results, as well as those with results not perceptible.
tacāpūrvabhedakalpanā nivṛttyartha mupakāradarśanamuktaṃ na śeṣandā pātvenā, na punaḥ sarvaśeṣāṇāṃ pāramārthikaṃ lakṣaṇamevoccataiti bhinnaviṣayatvādavirodha iti	But in this manner the present sūtra may not be a repetition but when the auxiliary character of all is dealt with, on the present occasion, the mention of that character of a particular kind on the previous occasion would be a mere useless repetition. Consequently we must explain the Bhishya as follows The question we proceed simply being as to what has been said in the previous sūtra, to explain that which has been said there. It is this the Auxiliary character of the threshing is based upon the definition given in the present sūtra and all that was shown in the previous sūtra was that, inasmuch as that action serves a visible purpose, it cannot be accepted as bringing about an Apurva. That is to say, it is the univer sally applicable Auxiliary character defined in the present sutra that has been attributed to the Action spoken of under the previouş sutra for the purpose of showing that it does not lead to an Apūrva.
guṇopyaruṇādiḥ kriyāyāḥ svasādhanabhūtadravyaparicchedasāmarthyādutpattyaiva śeṣaḥ	Sūtra ●According to Bādari, the Auxiliary character belongs to Substances, Properties and Sanctifications. We now proceed to show the objects that have the character of the Auxiliary. There are only three Auxiliaries The substancewhose auxiliary character is inherent, as shown under the sūtra, dravyāṇām, “etc.
nanu ca bhāvārthādhikaraṇe karaṇatvaṃ bāgasyoktaṃ satyamuktaṃ na tu sādhitam/ svargakāmādhikaraṇādhīnasiddhinā tena nāmapaṭa kara pātvamācanirākaraṇāt	and this character is denied only when it is found to have no use whatever in connection with tho Action The Property such as Redness and the like, serving to qualify the substance that helps in the completion of the Action, is from its very nature an auxiliary The Sanctification also, like threshing, etc., becomes an auxiliary, by reason of its making the corn fit for being made into cakes that are laid down as to be offered at sacrifices, and which could only be made of the threshed corn, and never out of the unthreshed one thus to this also the auxiliary character belongs by its very nature. To the sacrifice, etc., on the other hand, the auxiliary character does not belong by nature nor is it laid down by Vedic words as belong ing to them.
phantamapi yāgaṃ prati mādhyamānatvātpradhānanaṃ puruṣaṃ prati tvasya śeṣabhāvo naivopāttaḥ	Then, as for the Resultinasmuch as it is something to be accomplished by the Sacrifice, it has the character of the Principal in reference to the Sacrifice and in reference to the Agent, its auxiliary character has never been spoken of. In fact, being something desired, it must be accepted as the Principal while the Agent being a sub.
tantravārtike/	stance could, at best, be regarded as an auxiliary to the Sacrifice.
karmāṇyapi jaimini phalārthatvāt	Sūtra According to Jaimini, the auxiliary character resides in Actions also, as they are performed for the sake of Results.
gatārthametat	Sūtra The Result also, as it is for the sake of the Agent.
na hikaciduddhipūrvakāryevaṃ kāmayate svarga ātmānaṃ labhatāmiti / kintarhi mama upabhogyaḥ svāditi	For no intelligent person ever desires the acquisition of Heaven by itself he always desires it for the sake of his own enjoyment. Then again, the Ātmanēpada ending in the verbs yajeta and the like, in the sentence svargakāmo yajēta distinctly shows that the Result Heaven is to be enjoyed by the Agent performing the sacrifice, and not by anybody else.
tenopabhoktāraṃ prati phantamapi śeṣabhūtam	And thus there can be no doubt as to the Result being auxiliary to its enjoyer. Sūtra The Agent also, because he is for the sake of the Action.
yattāvad dravyaguṇa saṃskāra vityatra na tu yāgaphala puruṣeṣu śeṣatvamityabhiṣāyānte puruṣasya śeṣitvanirākaraṇaṃ tadasaṃbaddham / yattu pratyakṣaścāsya dravyatvātkarma pratiguṇabhāva iti /	In the case of such sentences as svargakāmo yajēta, the auxiliary character of the Agent is implied by the verb yujeta while it is directly laid down in sentences like the one that lays down the sacrificial post of the Udumbara wood to be of the same height as the sacrificer. And consequently the Agent also can be regarded as having the auxiliary character. The Bhashya on sūtra , having shown that the auxiliary character belongs to Substances, Properties and Sanctifications,and not to Sacrifices, Results and Agents,has gone on to deny the Principal character of the Agent and this is altogether irrelevant. “Then again, we find the Bhashya asserting that the fact of the Agent being auxiliary to the Action, on account of its being a substance is quite perceptible.
tadapi vyāhataṃ punaruktaṃ ca pūrvameṣābhihitatvāt /	But this is a mere repetition of something already mentioned before and rejected as untenable.
na ca yāgaphanābhyāṃ śeṣatvanirākaraṇa dṛdbhyāṃ mahāsyātulya pravṛttitvāduccāraṇaṃ yuktaṃ tasmādasadetat	Nor is it quite proper to speak of the Agent along with the Sacrifice and the Result, the possi bility of whose auxiliary character has been denied because the functioning of the Agent is not at all similar to that of these too. Hence these assertions are most improper.
rapekṣaśeṣatvābhidhānāt karmaphannapuruṣāṇāṃ ca dravyādīni prati prādhānyeva sthite sūcaireva parasparāpekṣaśeṣatvapratipādanāduktārthamiti mandaphalaṃ dṛśyate	“Thirdly, towards the end of the Adhikarana we find the Bhashya saying The conclusion finally arrived at by the author of the Vṛtli is this, etc.,etc. But inasmuch as it has already been declared by the sūtras that the auxiliary character of Substances, Properties and Sanctifications is independent of all other things, while the Sacrifice, the Result and the Agent are Principals in reference to the Substance, etc., and then the sutras to themselves have spoken of the auxiliary character of these Sacrifice,etc. as depending upon one another, what the Bhashya speaks of as the final conclusion arrived at by the Author of the Vritti is nothing more than a mere repetition of what has already been said before.
na tu yāgaphalapuruṣeṣu siddhāntavādisaṃmataṃ dvyākāratvam/ yāgaphalayorekāntenaiva śeṣitvātyaruṣasya cātyanta śeṣatvā, tsarvathā ya evaika ākāra pratiṣidstanaiva tadyākāratvanira/	In order to meet these objections, we should explain the Adhikaraṇa as follows There are two interpretations of the present Adhikaraṇa The Auxiliary having been defined as that which is for anothers sake, the Bhashya brings forward as the Turrapaksha, Badaris theory of the auxiliary character residing in Substances, Properties and Sanctifications ouly, which is based upon the theory of the auxiliary character consisting in Helping and then lays down the Siddhānta, in accordance with the theory of Jaimini. And as such it was only natural that, in the first instance, the Bhushya should, while putting forward the Pürvapaksha, have taken his stand upon the theory that the Auxiliary is that which helps.
karmāṣyapi jaiminirityādibhirantapatiyākārameva śeṣatvaṃ pratipāditam /	Thus then, as for the Agent, inasmuch as he is a substance, he helps the fulfilment of the Action and as such he can always be accepted both by Jaimini and Bãdari as an auxiliary. As for the Sacrifice and the Result, on the other hand, they are never found to help in the fulfilment of anything and as such they cannot according to Badari be regarded as Auxiliaries.
nanvevaṃ sati puruṣasya dravyatvātpūrvapañcavādinaitantravārtika /	And this is most natural because what the Purvapakshi should deny is what the Siddhānti asserts, and not anything at random and as it is the auxiliary character of these three that the Siddhanti holds, it is only natural that the Purvapakshi should deny the auxiliary character of these, and not the mere form of that character.
vābhyupagamya śeṣatvaṃ śeṣitve nirākṛte sidvāntavādinā tadeva pratipādanīyamiti na vaktavyaṃ puruṣaśca karmārthatvāditi /	The position of the Siddhanti being that Sacrifices, Results and Agents have a dual character, inasmuch as they are Auxiliaries to certain Actions, while Principals to others, it is this dual character of these that the Bāhshya, in accordance with Bādaris theory, denies by declaring that in Sacrifices, Results and Agents there is no dual character, as held by the Siddhanti and his reasons are that Sacrifices and Results are always Principals, while the Agent is always Auxiliary.
tena hi yāgaphantayoraśeṣatvāt tasya śeṣitvaṃ nirākṛtaṃ tataśva yāvadeva sūtradayena yāgaphalayoḥ śeṣatvaṃ pratipāditaṃ tāvadeva yāgopasarjanaṃ phalaṃ prati pradhānatvādubhau prati kevalaṃ śeṣitvameva prasaktamiti pralīne hyākāratve punaḥ śeṣatvapratiprasavārthamucyate puruṣaśca karmārthatvāditi / atha vā pareṇopakāradvāreṇa śeṣatvamabhyupagataṃ tadayuktaṃ manyamānaḥ phalayāgayorivāsyāpi pārārthyakṛtameveti pratipādayiṣyannāha / puruṣaśca karmārthatvānna tadupakāritvāditi athātra bhagavāniti /	And thus inasmuch as it is only the presence of the dual character that is denied, in the case of all the three, by the denial of the character of the Auxiliary in the first two and that of the Principal in the last, there is nothing very wrong in speaking of all the three conjointly, as all the three have the similarity of having their dual character denied. And the Siddhanta Sūtras also should be taken as establish ing the auxiliary character, including hand in hand with the dual character of the three,basing this on the definition of the Auxiliary as that which is for the sake of another.
naivedānīṃ bādarimataṃ pūrvapañcaḥ /	Objection Inasmuch as, with regard to the Agent, the Purvapakshi has admitted his auxiliary character on the ground of his being a substance, and has only denied his Principal character, it was necessary for the Siddhanti to establish his Principal character, and there was no use of establishing the fact of the Agent being an auxiliary on account of being for the sake of the Action because this is what has been already admitted by the opponent.
kiṃ tarhi śeṣaḥ parārthatvāditi sāmānyena lacaṇamukkā tasyaiva viṣayaprardaśanadvāreṇottaraḥ prapañcaḥ kriyate /	of the Agent, on the ground of his helping the sacrifice and taking exception to this, and holding his auxiliary character also to consist, like that of the Sacrifice and the Result, in the fact of his being for anothers sake, the author has declaredThe Agent also is an auxiliary, because he is for the sake of the Action, and not because he helps it.
tatra pūrvavyākhyāyāṃ dravyaguṇa saṃskāra ṣveva śeṣatvamityevamavadhāraṇaṃ pūrvapace kṛtam /	As all the four sūtras are taken as a subsequent expansion of the general definition of the Auxiliary, given in sūtra , as showing the objects possessing that character. In the previous interpretation, the sūtra , as declaring the auxili ary character to rest in Substances, Properties and Sanctifications only, has been taken as embodying the Purvapaksha.
idānīṃ tu siddhāntarūpeṇaiva bādarimatamapratiṣedhenānumataṃ kṛtvā lakṣaṇa prapañcābhyāṃ śeṣatvaṃ varṇayiṣyate	But now, it is as representing the Siddhanta that the author brings forward Bãdaris theory, simply by way of corroboration, and then proceeds to show further applications of the said definitionof the Auxiliary. And as for the declaration that the auxiliary character resides in Substances, Properties and Sanctifications only, it is taken in the sense that it is these alone that have always the auxiliary character only, and never the character of the Principal.
tasmādāpekṣikaśeṣaśeṣitvamātramevebhiḥ sūtraiḥ pratipādyate	Thus then, the upshot of the whole comes to be that there are two kinds of substrates of the said auxiliary characterthe Absolute those that are always Auxiliaries and the Relative those that are at times Auxili aries and at times Principals.
nanu ca dravyatṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda / guṇasaṃskārāṇāmapi svāṅgāni prati pradhānatvādyāgaṃ ca prati guṇabhāvādāpekṣikameva śeṣaśeṣitvam / tathā hi	Objection Inasmuch as we find that Substances, Properties and Sanctifications also are Principals, with reference to their subsidiaries, as well as auxiliaries with reference to Sacrifices,the auxiliary character of these also should be accepted as only Relative and not absolute. For instance, we find that the Corn is the Principal with reference to its Threshing, and that this Threshing also is Principal in reference to the Pestle and other Implements used in the threshing and then, while being Principals with reference to the Threshing, the Corn is “found to be auxiliary to the Preparation of the cake.
yeṣāṃ tu guṇānāṃ niṣpādyā sā tānprati śeṣiṇī /	Then as for Pro perties, such as Number and the like, we find them to be auxiliary to that which they qualify while in reference to those properties that bring abont the Number, it is Principal.
tathā saṃskāraḥ saṃmārgāvaghātādiragnibrohyāde śeṣaḥ svasādha nānāmidhvamana hanola khalamusalādīnāṃ śeṣo /	Similarly Sanctifications also, the Fire and the Corn rospectively while, with reference to their own accessories, the fuel and the pestle, etc., they are Principals.
tasmānnāvadhāraṇaṃ sidhyatīti /	Conse quently even these three cannot rightly be spoken of as always having the auxiliary character only.
dravyaguṇasaṃskārā hi phalavantaṃ yāgaṃ prati niyogataḥ śepabhūtāḥ satyapi svāṅgāni prati śeṣitve taṃ prati nāstītyabhidhīyate /	Reply In the case of Substances, Properties and Sanctifications, we find that they can never be the Principal with regard to which they are Auxiliaries while in the case of the Sacrifices, Results and Agent, on the other hand, we find that they have the two characters with regard to ono another. That is to say, Substances, Properties and Sanctifications always bear the auxiliary character towards the Sacrifice leading to some desirable re sult, even though towards their own subsidiaries they may bear the char acter of the Principal and with regard to the Sacrifice, the Principal char acter of these is as good as nonoxistent.
ata eva bhāṣyakāropi niyogato yajiṃ prati śeṣabhāva ityāha / na bravīti niyataḥ śeṣabhāva ityāpeśika itareṣāmityatrāpi yajiṃ pratītyanuvartate /	It is with a view to this that we have the declaration in the Bhashya with regard to the Sacrifice they always bear the auxiliary character and not that, they have always the auxiliary character only. Then again, the Bhäshya adds The auxiliary character of others is relative others= Sacrifices, Results and Agents and the qualifying clause ynjim prati with regard to the Sacrificepertains to this sentence also.
prati guṇatvaṃ prādhānyaṃ ca dṛśyate /	That is to say, in the case of these latter, we find that each of them bears the character of the Principal and the Auxiliary to the two others.
yaśca phacaṃ prati guṇaḥ sa śakyate phalasya svāminaṃ puruṣa mapi prati sutarāṃ guṇa iti vaktum /	For instance, the Sacrifice is Principal with regard to the Agent, who, as a substance, accomplishes it while with regard to the Result it bears the auxiliary character and then again, that Sacrifice which is auxiliary to the Result can very well be said to be auxiliary to the Possessor of the Result, the Agent and that Sacrifice which is the Principal with regard to the Agent, can certainly be called the Principal with regard to the Result, which is subordinate to the Agent.
evaṃ phalasya yāgaṃ prati prādhānyāttatmāghanaṃ puruṣamapi prati prādhānyaṃ, puruṣaṃ prati guṇatvāttadanuṣṭheye yāgepi guṇatvaṃ, tathā puruṣasya phalaṃ prati prādhānyāt tatsādhanaṃ yāgamapi prati pradhānatvam, yāgaṃ ca prati guṇabhāvāttatmādhye phalepi guṇātvam, na tvevaṃ dravyaguṇa saṃskāra sviti viśeṣaḥ /	So also the Result, which is Principal with regard to the Sacrifice, is Prin cipal also with regard to the Agent, who is an accessory of the Sacrifice and while it is auxiliary to the Agent, it is auxiliary also to the Sacri fice that is performed by him. Similarly the Agent, being the Principal with regard to the Result, is Principal also with regard to the Sacrifice which brings about that Result and while he is auxiliary to the Sacri fice, he is auxiliary also to the Result brought about by that Sacrifice. Such mutual double relationship is not found in the case of Substancos, Properties and Sanctifications. And in this lies the difference between these on the one hand, and the Sacrifice, etc., on the other.
yattvidaṃ pāraṃparyeṇāpi śeṣatvaṃ prādhānyaṃ coktam idamarthalaścaṇaṃ vastumātrarūpeṇetyava gantavyam/ na vyavahārārthaṃ mā bhūdaṅgatvaśina vikṛta/	implied by the existing state of things and not spoken of in any texts and they should not be taken as mentioned for purposes of observance at the performance of sacrifices as in that case, inasmuch as the Agent and the Result would be indirect auxiliaries to the modifications of ori ginal Sacrifices, they would also have to be imported into the per formance of these and this would be a flagrant contradiction of the Sid dhanta bearing on that subject.
phalapuruṣayorapyatideśātmidvāntavirodhaḥ / tasmādetāvatprakāra eva vacya māṇa prapañcaśeṣatva viṣayasaṃkṣepa iti siddham	We have explained the marks and the objects of the auxiliary character. And we now proceed to consider the way in which the Auxili aries become applied to actual practice and in the next three Adhika raṇas we shall treat of the practical applications of Sanctifications, Sub stances and Properties, respectively. Some people hold that the practical application of the Sanctification is pointed out by the suggestive Power of words that of Substances, by Syntactical Connection and that of Properties, by Direct Assertion.
tattvācāryā necchanti /	But this view is not countenanced by our teachers.
yadyapyatra vicitrapramāṇavyāpāraparāmarśaḥ tathāpi śrutiviniyogaṇvāca pār̤he liṅgādiviniyogastu dvitīyapādātprabhṛti bhaviṣyatītyuktam /	Because though we do actually come across the operation of various authorities for practical application, yet, in the present Pāda, we are concerned, preeminently, only with such applications as are based upon Direct Asser tion while those based upon the suggestiveness of words, and the other authorities, will be dealt with in Pada II et seq., as we have already said above. The Siddhanti objects to the doubt, by saying that the details are distinctly mentioned in connection with certain definite materials. But the opponent thinking that the connection of the details Thresh ing f.

But this way of justifying the Doubt appears very improper.
vākyādhikaraṇe coktā śrutibāghapratikriyā / nahi vrohyādibhiḥ saṃvadhyamānā avaghātādayo nāvaghātādayo bhavanti /	Be cause a word is never used without another word and the remedy for the contradiction by Direct Assertion, we have already explained in the Väkyādhikaraṇa. As a matter of fact, by becoming connected with the Corn, the Threshing does not cease to be Threshing. And if this were the case, then alone could the Syntactical Connection be contrary to Direct Assertion, and thereby rejected. On the contrary, we find that the Threshing cannot be performed by itself and as such it could not but be performed in connection with another object such as the Corn.
yadi hyevaṃ bhaveyuḥ tataḥ śrutiviruddhatvā dvākyaṃ bādhyeta / atra punaḥ kevalānā mevāvaghātādīnāmanuṣṭhātu maśakyatvāt avaśyameva saṃbandhyantare kāryā /	In accordance with your theory also, the threshing is not performed by itself and then if you reject the object pointed out by Syntactical Connection, you take upon yourself the much greater trouble of connect ing its performance with every one of the objects spoken of in the Context. If you were to base its connection with something outside the Context, the words relative to which you would supply from without, that too would involve a deal of trouble. Then if you hold it to be connected with the Principal sacrifice, by aiding it indirectly, that would mean a remotely involved connection.
na hi bhavatyakṣepyavaghātādayaḥ kevala kiyate atha tu naiva kena citsaṃbadhyate tato vidhyānarthakyaprasaṅgaḥ tenaivaṃ vyākhyeyam	If, lastly, you do not hold it to be connected with anything, then its injunction becomes wholly pur poseless. Consequently the aforesaid way of justifying the Doubt is highly objectionable. Then we explain it as followsThe Doubt in the present case is not based upon the fact of the various sentences being taken separately, or all together but upon the fact of the various Details apper taining to the single Final Apūrva, or to distinct Intermediate Apurvas.
naivācāyaṃ pūrva pacaheturavaghātādayaḥ padārthāḥ svatantrāḥ śrutyā vidhīyante vidhīyate 'vaghātādiḥ śrutyā brahmādisaṃgataḥ /	That is to say, the reasoning of the Pūrvapaksha is not this That the Threshing, being denoted by the word, is enjoined independently by itself, by Direct Assertion while it is by Syntactical Connection that it is connected with the Corn and this connection therefore is set aside by the former Direct Assertion consequently, being enjoined independently, it is only natural that there should be a doubt as to with all sorts of materials, or only with those objects in connection with whom they are found to bring about certain visible effects.
vrīhitvādyarthatā cāsya niṣphanatvena neṣyate tataḥ saṃyuktatvātsarve sarvaca na prāpnuyuḥ /	Bub what is meant by it is that the Threshing is enjoined by Direct Asser tion, as connected with the Corn but we cannot admit it to apply to the class Corn i.e., Corn in general as such an application would be absolutely useless. That is to say, if the Threshing were taken to be connected with the Corn just as it is denoted by the word “ Vrīhi i.e., the class Corn, then, on account of this connection, it could not apply to all the materials.
ete punarnavamādyādhikaraṇanyāyena śra/taṃ brocitvamujaṅkhyā pūrva sādhanatvena saṃbadhyante / tacca pra karaṇa/ peśāpūrva sādhanāṃśannā pāgamyatvādvākya gamya miti manyamāna āha	As a matter of fact, we find that, in accordance with the first Adhikaraṇa of Adhyāya IX, the Threshing passes over the directly denoted class Corn, and becomes connected with that which brings about the Apūrva and there can be no doubt that this connection, being pointed out by the indication of the element of the capability of bringing about the Apurva which depends upon the Con text, is based upon Syntactical Connection and it is this that is meant by the sentence the connection of these with the Corn, etc., is brought about by means of Syntactical Connection Bhashya. Then as for the particular Syntactical Connection, in the form of an indication of the capability of bringing about the Apurva,it is equally capable of pertaining to the Vegetable, the Butter and the CurdButter mixture, as all these are mentioned in the same Con text.
teṣāmarthena saṃbandhaḥ /	In regard to this question, the author begins with propounding the Siddhanta theory They are connected with a definite purpose. purpose.

Or, we may take the sutra as meaning that the scripture itself points out that they should be performed in connection with that wherein they serve some useful purpose. Thus, f.i., the Threshing comes to be taken as performed with reference to that particu lar Aparva, the means of which is indicated by the word ‘Vrihi Corn, by reason of that capability of bringing about the Apūrva which inheres in the same substrate the individual sacrificial corn as the Class Corn denoted by that word Vrihi and it could not be taken along with the means of any other Apurva, which is not similarly indicated, and with which, therefore, the Threshing could have no connec tion.

The opponent explains his position as follows It is the subtle potential state of the Result, which appears as its Sprout, that is called Apūrva, on account of its appearing in a form that never existed before this we have already explained before in Adh.
ta ca phanaikatvāde kame vādhyavasoyate / tatsādhanatvaṃ cājyaupathasānāyyānāṃ sarveṣāma viśiṣṭam /	Conse quently, inasmuch as the Result of the DarçaPurnamāsa is one only, there cannot be more than one Apūrva and the capability of bringing about this Apurva belongs equally to the Vegetables, the Butter and the CurdButter mixture hence the details laid down with refer ence to these materials must be taken as pertaining to all of them.

And this is another reason in favour of the view that the details pertain to all the materials.

Then, as for the objective character of the Oorn as mentioned in the sentence Vrihinavahanti, it is found in all the other objects also as all of them are objects to be offered.
tamādapūrvī saṃbaddhama pradeyamaprakṛtāpūrvasādhanaṃ ca varjayitvā sarve sarvatra kartavyāḥ /	not objects to be offered, and as do not help in the bringing about of the particular Apūrva of the Context, with reference all other objects, should all the details be performed.
yo arthātprāpnotītyacoditaḥ san sāmarthya na laukika prayojanena vā yaḥ prāpnoti sa tadarśana vyavatiṣṭhate /	Then as for those details that are either indirectly implied, or, not being directly enjoined, are only pointed out by certain purposes served by them in matters relating to ordinary worldly affairs,the application of these could be restricted in accordance with the purpose served by them.
atra punaḥ prakṛtābupadeśena prāka prayojanebhyaḥ svarūpamātreṇa kalpayiṣyamāṇaprayojanāḥ santo vidhīyante	Or, in a case where, as in the case of the modifications of original sacrifices, the Details appear by means of certain purposes previously enjoined,and the purpose has not got to be assumed from the details themselves, the performance of such details would be adjust ed in accordance with the purposes served.
arthalopādakarma syāt	Sutra The absence of a useful purpose would deprive it of the character of Action.
dṛṭārthaṃ lopācchāvagamyārthalopādveti nigadavyākhyātaṃ bhāghyam /	That is to say, by denying the visible purpose actually served, or that which is mentioned in scriptures as to be served by it, we would set aside the performability of the Action, etc.,etc. The sense of the Bhashya is quite clear.
phalaṃ tu saha ceṣṭayā śabdārtho Sbhā vādviprayoge syāt yaduktamadṛṣṭa kalpanānnaivetaratrāpyarthacopa iti	Sūtra The Result is found to appear along with the operation it is only when there is no visible result, that its absence could justify the Details being taken merely as ex pressed by the words. It has been urged that, inasmuch as we shall assume certain imperceptible effects, there would not be an absence of useful purposes.
yadyāhatya vivarannājyepi prathanādayaḥ /	That is to say, it is only on the strength of the Apparent In consistency of a Direct Vedic Declaration that we can rightly assume im perceptible effects.
adṛṣṭārthā agatyā syurdṛṣṭaṃ vā na bhavedyadi taccāmnānamanyathaiva dṛṣṭārthatayopapanna mityarthāpatterasaṃbhavaḥ	But, as a matter of fact, we find the Declaration of the Thickening to be quite consistent in its visible purpose, when taken along with the Cake and as such there is no Inconsistency that could justify our assuming an imperceptible effect, on the strength whereof we would connect the Thickening with the Butter also.
anyatra tu ceṣṭāmātram / na ca saphalaceṣṭānuṣṭhānasaṃbhave viphalānuṣṭhāne vi tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	To explainas a matter of fact, we find that the Threshing brings about its perceptible result in the Corn, along with its performance while in the others the Butter, etc., we find the mere operation of Thresh ing, without any results and so long as a useful operation is possible, no Vedic Injunction can ever urge the agent to the performance of a use less operation and in the absence of such urging by a Vedic Injunction, there cannot be any ground for an assumption of imperceptible results.
taditaretarāśrayaṃ bhavati / phalādidhirvidheśca phacamityabhyupagamāt	And thus there would be a mutual interdependence the assumption of the Injunction of Threshing with regard to the Butter being based upon the Results imperceptible, and the assumption of the Results being based upon the Injunction.
tathotpavanādīnāmājyasānnāyyayoriti yojanīyam /	The same reasoning may be applied to the case of the Boiling, etc., as to be performed in regard to the Butter and the CurdButter mixture.
nāpecyetopakārāya so' grāhyo na tvayaṃ tathā	Because without the removal of the Chaff, the Corn could neither be made into the Cake, nor be offered at the sacrifice this is what is meant by the Bhashya saying prayojanañca tēnēti.
biprayoge tu dṛṣṭasya phalasya tadabhāvajā / teṣāṃ śabdārthamā atkhātyā dṛṣṭārthakalpanā	S In a case, however, where there is a total absence of perceptible effects, the Details would be taken merely as expressed by the words and hence the said absence could justify the assumption of imperceptible effects and in that case the Threshing would apply to the Butter and the CurdButter mixture also. But when a distinctly perceptible effect is present, there can be no assumption of an imperceptible one and hence the application of the Details becomes restricted, in accordance with the purpose served by each.

As a matter of fact, however, we find that for each of the Actions there is a distinct Apurvaevery one of these having the capability of having the particular Action performed with reference to itself.
tatra bhedastāvadapūrvādhikaraṇe sādhitaḥ /	As for the fact of each of these Apurvas being distinct, we have already proved it under the Apūrvādhikaraṇa IIi.

As a matter of fact, however, they are not wholly useless either because that alone is rejected as wholly devoid of that capability, on the ground of uselessness, which brings about absolutely no effect, or when, even without the effect brought about by it, the Material and the Sacrifice, etc., are all duly accomplished.
āgneyādyavāntarāpūrvāṇi tu paramāpūrvasiddhyaṅgatvātpāraṃparyeṇa phalavanti /	The Minor Apūrvas in question, however,viz., those that follow from the Āynēya aud other subsidiary sacrifices of the DarçaPūrṇamāsa,are actually found to be indirectly conducive to a distinct Result, through the help that they accord to the Final Apūrva of the DarçaPurnamāsa.
na ca dharmebhyaḥ prāk siddhāni nirjātopāyaparimāṇāni vā /	And prior to the performance of the Details in question, these Minor Apūrvas are not accomplished nor have they the extent of their means clearly known.
tasmādātmalābhārthameva prayujyante /	Consequently, it is for the sake of the accomplishment of themselves that these Aparvas instigate the performance of the Details in ques tion.

And in the case in question, we find that the word ‘Vrīki, as also the rest, points to that Apūrva which is brought about by Actions performed with regard to the Vrihi, and not to others brought about by those performed with regard to the Butter,etc. because it has no connection with these. Thus then, the Threshing comes to have its use fulness established by having obtained its own specific Minor Apūrva, aud does not stand in need, either of the Final Apurva, or of other Miner Apūrvas brought about by other Actions.

If there were no Aparva in that case, then an imperceptible result would have had to be assumed and in that case, we could take the operation to be performed with reference to even such helps as are not pointed out by the word Vrihi! As a matter of fact, however, we have a distinct Apurva and as such none of these contin gencies are possible.

evaṃ tagneyādyapūrvasaṃvandhāviśeṣāt srugādīnāmavaghātādayaḥ prāpnuvanti/	Objection But then, inasmuch as the sacrificial implements, the Sruk, etc., would also be connected with the Minor Apūrva of the Agnēya sacrifice at which the VrihiRice is offered, the operation of Threshing A which you take to be laid down with reference to that which brings about that particular Apūrva would come to be applied to those imple ments also.

In the case of the Threshing, etc., we find that on account of their connection with the Vrihi, etc., they are performed with reference to distinct Apūrvas while in the case in question we do not find any Apurva in connection with the Uddhanana which is the particular action in connection with which we find the Sphya mentioned, with reference to which that Action could be performed. In the former case we find the Threshing mentioned only once, in connection with the single substance of Vrihi while in the present case, we find the various Implements mentioned in two connections in the two sentencesSphyaçcaetc. .
yattu tasminnevāpūrve samānakārakatvenopakariṣyati tasya bhaviṣyantyeva dharmāḥ /	If, however, the latter sentence is accepted as Injunctive, then, in accordance with foregoing Adhikarana, the employment of the Implements would be restricted in accordance with the connections mentioned in these sentences as held by the Siddhanta.
yathā yavānāṃ sarvaṃ caitannabame vistareṇa vacyāmaḥ	Inasmuch as there is no connection with distinct Apūrvas, and as in all cases equally there are perceptible effects produced, we must employ the Implements in accordance with their capabilities.
sphyāderutpattisaṃbandhaḥ kāryerudnanādibhiḥ / tatra yajñāyudhānīti prāptamevānukīrtyane /	To the above, we make the following reply As a matter of fact, we find that the Sphya, etc., are mentioned in their originative Injunction in connection with certain specific functions, the uddhanana for instance and all that the sentence sphyaçca,etc. does is to describe or refer to what has been laid down in those Injunctions. Specially as in the sen.

kapālādīnāṃ tāvadastyeva paroḍāga dyapūrvabhedaḥ / itareṣāmapyudvananādidvāratvādanyatra ta skṛtopakārābhāvāda saṃkaraḥ / tadyathāvaghātādayaḥ samānāpūrvanivandhaneṣvapi srugādiṣu kārakāntaratvānna kriyante	ēlāni,etc. serves to describe or refer to that character of the sacrificial Implement which we find belonging to the sphya and the rest laid down in the sentences sphyenoddhanti,etc. Then, it has been argued that, in the case in question we do not find distinct Apūrvas that could make the Actions performed with refer ences to themselves. To that we make the following reply In the case of the kapala, etc., there is a difference in the Apūrvas, due to the Cake,etc. and as for the others, these can never become mixed up in any common action, because they are distinctly laid down as the means of the particular actions uddhanana and the rest they could not serve any useful purpose in connection with any other action just as, even though the Threshing is connected with the same Apūrva as the Sruk, etc., yet it is not performed in connection with the Sruk, etc., because of the function of these being different from that of the Vrihi in connection with which the Thresh ing is mentioned.
nanu ca piṅgācye kahāyanī śavdayorapi guṇavacana tvānnevāca vākye dravyamasti kathaṃ gaṇavacanatvamiti cet	And with reference to the quality of Redness signified by Aruṇā, there arises a question, as to whether it qualifies the substance that is mentioned in the same sentence with itself, or it qualifies all the substances mentioned in the context. Objection Inasmuch as the words pingākshi and ēkahdyani also siginfy qualities, there is no word in the sentence that signifies a substauce and as such there is no basis for the question raised.
soyāstīti pya saṃbandhe matvarthīyaḥ pravartate	Because one who is not related to the Cow, is never spoken of as the possessor of the Cow and hence it is necessary that the qualifying relationship should be expressed beforehand.
na hi gobhirasaṃbaddho gomānityabhidhīyate /	Now then, we find that the Relationship cannot be denoted by the basic noun go because that word denotes only the class Cow.
tasmādviśeṣaṇaṃ tatra saṃbandhaḥ pūrvamiṣyate	Thus then, in accordance with the law ‘tadă game hi tad drshyate, we must conclude the Relationship to be denotod by the affix .
pratyayastu tatra vartata ityupādatte /	The affix, however, is found to signify the Qualified Object and hence it denotes that Re lationship.
sa cedupāttastenaiva saṃbandhipratyayasiddherabhidhānaśalipratibandhāt viśeṣyānabhidhānam /	And as soon as the affix denotes the Relationship, the idea of this Relationship at once brings about its necessary concomitant, the idea of the Related Object the Person and thus the denotative potency of the affix with regard to the Related Person having been set aside by the prior indication of it by the previouslydenoted Relationship, the Affix could not serve to denote the Qualified or Related Object the Per son.
na ca viśeṣyapratyayātsaṃvandhapratyayo bhavati / prāk saṃbandhādviśeṣyatvābhāvā, siddheśca viśeṣyatvena saṃbandhe na paścātkiṃcitprayojanamastītyapratītirevāsya prāpnoti /	And, as a matter of fact, the idea of the Qualified Object is not found to bring about an idea of the Relationship because until the qualifying Relationship has been cognised, there can be no idea of the Qualified Object. And when the Qualified Character has been duly established and cognised, there remains no further need of any idea of the Qualifying Relationship and hence if the Qualified Object were previously cognised, there would be an absolute noncognition of the Qualifying Relationship.
itaśca pratyayārthaḥ saṃvandhaḥ /	Consequently, it must be admitted that what should be denoted beforehand is the Relationship and hence it is this that is denoted by the Affix.
śabdavṛttinimitte hi bhāvapratyaya iṣyate / devadattasya gomattvaṃ saṃvandhaśca pratīyate tathā devadattasya gomattvamityukte gavi pratipattyabhāvātsaṃbandha niṣkarṣa pratī eva bhāvapratyayārthodhdavasīyate	For the following reason also, the Affix matup should be taken as denoting the Relationship In all cases, it is the denotation of a word that is referred to by the Abstract Affix and in the clause Devadattasya gomattvam we distinctly find the Relationship that is cognised. That is to say, as in the case of götva go + the Abstract Affix tva, the gotva qualifying a particular cow, the one with the variegated colour f.i.,we conclude that the qualifying class Cow is slenoted by the Abstract Affix, as apart from the word and hence that the word go denotes that Class so, in the same manner “ when we meet with the clause ‘Dēvadattasya gōmattvam, we find that there is no cognition of the Cow, while there is a distinct cognition of the Relationship, as, apart from the Cow and consequently we must admit that the word goman denotes that Relationship.
yadi ca matupā saṃbandhobhihitaḥ tataḥ prakṛtipratyayau pratyayārthaṃ saha brūta iti gomatprātipadikādutpanno bhāvapratyayaḥ tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	And that which is denoted by the Abstract Affix forms also the basis of the donotation of that basic noun which signifies the Qualified Object and in the case of all words, we find that that which forms the basis of the denotation of a word, is its primary meaning, while the Qualified Object forms only the secondary or indicated meaning. Then, it is only if the matup affix denote the Relationship, that the Abstract Affix added to the basic noun gomân could denote the Relationship because we have a general law to the effect that tho base and the affix conjointly express the denotation of the affix.
tasmādapi saṃbandhorthaḥ /	For this reason also the matup affix must be taken as denoting the Relationship.
sarvatra hi bhāvapratyayaḥ saṃvandhamabhidhatte /	The aboveapplies to all Verbal and Nominal Derivatives, as well as Compounds, that have their significations based upon their etymology. Because in the case of all these words, the Abstract Affix denotes the Relationship.
rājapuruṣatvamāpagavatvaṃ pācaphatvami, tyata evaite yaugikāḥ yatastena nimittena vartante /	In fact, all such words, as ‘Rājapurushaḥ, Aupagavaḥ, “Pācaka, and the like, are called yaugika, simply because their denotation is based upon yoga.e., Connection or Relationship.
tasmānmatvarthaṃviṣayatvādvaintrīhere kahāyanyādiśabdaiḥ saṃbandhobhidhīyate /	Thus then, in the case of the words Pingakshi and Ekahāyani, also, the signification of the Bahuvrihi compound being identical with that of the Possessive Affix matup, the words must be taken as denoting the Relationship and as such they cannot be spoken of as denoting a substance.
ekaṃ hāyanamasyā iti ṣaṣyantenānyapadārthaḥ pradargyate /	II.Further, the Bahuvrihi compound is laid down as pointing to something different from that which is denoted by the component words and hence also, that something different being signified by an affix, the principal thing denoted cannot but be the Relationship.
tadrūpadarśanārthameva sarvanāmaprayogaḥ kevalāyā vibhaktaraprayogātsarvanāmārthapratītyabhāvācca / ṣaṇṭyāśca svaskhāmisaṃbandha samūhavikārāvayavādisaṃbandho vācya ityetatprasiddham /	That is to say, the compound akahayani being expounded as ‘ēkam ‘hâyanam asyāḥ, the something different meant to be expressed by the compound is found to be pointed out by the word asyäḥ with the geni tive affix and as the denotation of the genitive is the denotation of an affix, it must be regarded as the principal factor and hence it is for the sake of pointing out that denotation of the genitive affix, that we must take the pronoun in asyaḥ as the genitive affix could not be used alone by itself, and also as there is no cognition of the denotation of the Pronoun itself. Then as for the genitive, it is a usually recognised fact that all that it can dengte is some sort of a Relationship, such as that subsisting between the possessor and the possessed, the whole and the part, the original and the modification, and so forth.
śratopi saṃbandhābhidhānaṃ bahubrokṣiṇā /	For this reason also Bahuvrihi compounds must be taken as denoting the Rela tionship.
na cāpyanyapadārthagvaṃ jāteradhyavasīyate / na hi piṅgācisaṃbandha stasyā nāpyekavarṣatā	Nor could the very first application of the word Pingakshi be accepted to have been made to the particular cow born today. Consequently we must accept a certain generic entity as the denotation of the word Pingakshi and this generic entity can be none other than the Relationship as we have already shown that the word cannot denote the class Cow.
vayovasthābhidhīyeta yadyapi tvekadāyinī / tathāpi guṇa evāsau na dravyamiti gamyate	“ IV.Further, even though the word ‘ēkah āyani could denote the age of one year, yet that too would be only a quality, and not a sub stance. Thus then, inasmuch as the sentence in question is found to be wholly devoid of a substantive, it cannot form the basis of the discus sion in the present Adhikarana.
yadyeka hāyanyādibhiḥ śabdaḥ saṃbandhobhidhīyeta tato nodāhriyeran /	As all Rüdhi conventional words like ghata, etc. denote classes as held by you also and all Yaugika etymologi “cal words like ‘Pācaka,etc. have been shown to denote Relationship then as for those words that are significant of absolutely nothing else save a particular substance,such f.i.
na tvetaiḥ saṃbandhobhidhīyate /	As a matter of fact, however, they do not denote a Relationship.
idda hi saṃbandhamātraṃ vābhidheyaṃ kalpyeta tahiśeṣovā / yadi tāvatsaṃbandhamācaṃ tataḥ sarvayaugikānāmeka viṣayopanipātātyaryāyatvaprasaṅgaḥ	Because such a denotation would give rise to endless complications. For instance, we could assume such a denoted Relationship to be either Relationship in general, or some particular Relationship. If the former, then all etymological words, denoting the same Relationship in general, would become synonymous. If the latter, then, inasmuch as there could not be any peculiarity in the Relationship itself, the peculiarity will have to be admitted to be brought out by the members related z.e., the Re lationship could be specified only by the members related.
tataśca tamabhidhāya saṃvanvābhiṣāyāmatigauravaṃ syāt	And then after having denoted that, the affix would go on to denote the Relationship as held by you and cer tainly this process of denotation would be a highly complicated one. .
saṃbandhinaiva saṃbandhaḥ pratyetuṃ yadi śakyate /	It has been urged above thatuntil the Relationship is cognised, there is no cognition of the Qualified Object. To that we make the following reply It is quite true that without the qualification, there is no cognition of the Qualified Object.
tasmādarthākṣiptenaiva saṃbandhena bhavitavyam /	Then, it has been argued thatDevadatta cannot be qualified by the cows that are not related. True, he is not so qualified it is for that very reason that the cows indicate the necessary Relationship.
yattvapratīte saṃbandhe viśeṣyaṃ na pratīyataiti / tatra brūmaḥ devadatto hi gobhiravacchinno vivakṣitaḥ	In any way all that the word goman expresses is that one is qualified by cows and then there arises a question as to the position in which the cows qualify him and then it is that the particular Relationship of the cows with Devadatta is indicated and thus we find that the indication of the Relationship is done by the Cows, and not by the word ‘gōmān.
na viśiṣanti gāvorthaṃ pṛthivyāmanavasthitāḥ / tatra kiṃ śakyate vaktaṃ pṛthivyapyabhidhīyate tantravārtika /	For if all that is implied in the word gōmān were to form the direct denotation of the word, then, inasmuch as the Cows could not serve the purposes of qualification, unless they existed on the earth, the earth also would have to be accepted to be denoted by the word! That is to say, a word cannot be taken as denoting anything and everything, with out which the one object denoted by it does not attain its true character all that the word güman can be taken to denote is that without which there is no idea of the qualified object.
vaktṛvyāpāramātraṃ ca saṃbandha pratyavekṣaṇam / sa hi gobhirasaṃbaddhaṃ na gomantaṃ vivakṣati /	And such an object is the cow only, without a cognition of which the idea of the person qualified by the cow could not appear which cannot be said of the Relationship even without which the idea of the Person is found to appear. Then again, the seeking for the Relationship is the function of the speaker as he cannot speak of the Possessor of Cows, without a rela tionship with the cows.
sarvatra hi vaktakama viparyayeṇa śrotuḥ kramo bhavati/	That is to say, in all cases, the order of sequence in the operation of the Hearer is the reverse of that of the Speaker.
sahi prathamaṃ tāvatkiṃ cidviśeṣyaṃ vivaśati tatastasya kena cidviśeṣaṇena vinābhidhātumabhakteḥ viśeṣaṇavivacāṃ karoti tataḥ śabdoccāraṇam/	For instance, the operation of the speaker is as follows First of all, he desires to speak of a certain Qualified Object then, inasmuch as the Qualified Object could not be spoken of without the Qualification, he desires to speak of the Qualification then he utters the word gö män, f.i..
śrotā punaḥ prathamaṃ tāvacchandaṃ pūṭaṇoti tato viśeṣaṇaṃ tato viśeṣyaṃ tatastadupapattyarthāni vasvantarāṇi pra padyate / tena yadyapi vaktrā pūrva saṃbandha ālocitaḥ tathāpi śrotā paścādevainaṃ grahīṣyati /	While the operation of the Hearer is as follows First of all, he hears the word uttered then he cognises the Qualification and then the Qualified Object and after that he comes to have ideas of other accessories as the Relationship between the Qualification and the Qualified, etc., etc., necessary for the full accomplishment of the cognition of the Qualified Object. ceived the Relationship beforehand, yet, it is only at the end that the Hearer cognises it. As a matter of fact, however, even the Speaker does not recognise the Relationship very much beforehand because it cannot be cognised until the members related have been cognised consequently, in the operation of the Speaker also, the Relationship comes to be recognised only latterly and hence, in this case also, it does not escape from the position of being indirectly implied.
na tvatra vaktrāpyasai/	For these reasons, the Relationship cannot be taken as denoted by the word.
pūrvataramacadhāritaḥ viśeṣyatvena saṃpannaṃ tadviśeṣaṇasaṃgatam /	That is to say, the Relationship, that is expressed by the Genitive and the Locative caseendings, is selfsufficient, and one devoid of any Gender or Number,etc. while that expressed by the matup affix is not so.
goviśiṣṭoyamityevaṃ gomacchabdobhidhāsyati vibhaktivācyarūpeṇa saṃbandho nāvagamyate / rūpāntareṇa vaktavya iti nāsti ca lakṣaṇam	Nor is there any rule laying down the declaration that, that which is devoid of gender, etc., when expressed by the Genitive or the Locative, be comes endowed with them when expressed by the matup affix,as there is in the case of an entity, expressed by a Verbal Derivative, which is said to acquire the character of a substance. Thus then, the only two alternatives that are possible are these That we should accept the word to denote a Relationship devoid of gender, etc., and that the word should be taken as denoting the Object Related, as qualified by the implied relationship.
tatra tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	And we have no hesitation in pronouncing in favour of the second alternative.
kimasattvabhūtasaṃbandhābhidhānamāśrīyatām uta saṃbandhyevārthasabhyatadviśiṣṭobhidhīyatāmiti taducyatām	Because the second member of the relationship related hav ing been denoted as qualified by another member previously cognised, the Relationship comes to be cognised along with the related members and hence it is not held to be denoted separately by itself.
yattu siddhe viśeṣye na paścātsaṃbandhapratyayena kāryamiti /	established, there is no need of a subsequent cognition of the qualifying Relationship.
satyaṃ nāsti, vināpi tu tena nāntarīyakatvātpratīyataiti kiṃ kriyatām yacca bhāvapratyayenābhidhānādasya matvarthatvamityatrāphi bramaḥ	True, there is no need but even without such need, it is cognised, all the same, as the necessary concomitant of the Qualified Object and what harm does it do if it is so cognised ? Another argument that has been urged is Inas much as the Rela tionship is denoted by the abstract affix, it must be accepted as the denotation of the matup affix.
ata ṭaṇḍiśabdena saṃvandhyevocyate yathā /	To that we make the following reply In the case of the word gomattoa, we are forced to admit the Relationship to be denoted by it, because there is no other quality inhering therein that could be denoted.
yahadhyekaṃ cāyanamanyā ityanyapadārtho ṣaṇyarthaprādhānyātsaṃbandhe bahuvrodhiriti /	but even though this might make the Relationship somehow denotable by the word gōmaltva, it could never be denoted by the word ‘gōmān.
prathamāntatvācca paruṣaḥ pradhānarūpeṇa samāmārtho bhavati evameva citragvādiśabdairdevadattādiviśiṣṭā gāva eva pratoyeran na citragoviśiṣṭo devadattādiḥ	Because in the case of the word gomattva, which is the Bhāva char acter of gōman, that upon which the use of the word gōmān in the word gomattva is based, is what is meant by the Bhava character of the gōman and it is this Bhava that is denoted by the abstract affixes tva, tal and the like. Thus then, we find that the QualificationCowsthat is denoted by the basic noun go is entirely different from the Person possessing the cows gōmān and hence the Cows are not denoted by the Abstract Affix. Then, as a matter of fact, the Abstract Affix denotes a quality inher ing in the object and in the word in question there is no other quality denoted, which could be spoken of as the Bhava, on the ground of the denotation of the word being present in it.
napyanyatarasyetyanya padārthabhūtadravyaprādhānyādhyavasānam citravyaktiriyaṃ jātidravyaṃ nānāguṇaṃ tvidam /	And even though there is no reason for taking the Relationship as denoted, yet, inasmuch as there is sufficient reason to believe that, in the nature of things, the Relation actually subsists in the object denoted, that reason too is con sidered, for the nonce, enough to make it accepted as denoted by the Abstract Affix.
tadiheka chāyanamasyā iti jāteranāditvānna viśeṣaṇaṃ saṃbhavatīti vyaktirāśrīyate	Thus then, even this argument does not afford sufficient reason for assuming all etymological words to be denotative of Relationship. For these reasons, if must be admitted that, just as in the case of the word Dandi it is the member related that is denoted,so also is it in the case of all etymological words, like Pingakshi.
na ca tadupalakṣitābhyonyatra prayoga ityavyabhicāraḥ	Then as for the exis tence of the Relationship in that member, it can be explained as shown above.
ataśca piṅgatvākṣitvābhyāṃ svavyaktayo guṇāvayavātmikā lakṣyante tābhiravayavi dravyamupalakṣyate	Consequently we conclude that what is denoted by the Bahuvrihi compound is a Substance, and not its Quality. being that Relationship which is expressed by the genitive ending, the compound must be taken as denoting that Relationship. To this we make the following replyThough that which is denoted by the Bahuvrihi is spoken of by asyāḥ in ‘ēkam hāyunam asyāḥ”, yet the genitive in asyāḥ is cognised as equal to the Nominative.
prāgapi ca devadattādiśabdādanyapadārthapratīteḥ na vākyārthatvakalpamā/ na ca kevalaṃ samāsavelāyāṃ yā padārthāvavadharito to de vatādyaryasaṃbandhino yato vākyārtho devadattaḥ syāt /	If the third objectthe member relatedwere really one expressed by a ward with the genitive ending, then,just as in the case of the word rajñaḥ purushaḥ, the Raja, being mentioned by a word with the genitive, becomes the qualification of the Purusha, while the Purusha, mentioned with the Nominative ending, and thus being the predominant factor qualified by it, comes to be taken as denoted by the compound ‘rājapurushaḥ,so also, in the case of such Bahuvrihi compounds as citraguḥ, ekahayani and the like, what would come to be denoted by them would be the Cows as qualified by Devadatta, its possessor, and not the possessor Devadatta as qualified by the cows which would be high ly objectionable.
tasmādavabhyaṃ pratīteḥ smaraṇācānyapadārthomya vācca ityabhyupagantavyam /	Consequently the real bearing of the Bahuvrihi com pound Citraguḥ must be expounded as citrāṇām gavām ayam tho Person as related to the cows of variegated colour.
ataścaivamādiṣu bahuvrīheranyapadārthābhidhānaśaktirdṛṣṭeti yatrāpi kathaṃ cijñaṛṇā saṃbhavati tatrāpi pūrvakṛtabhaktyanapāyāda bhidheyatvame vādhya vasīyate /	Though, as a rule, people expound the compound differently as citrā gāvō yasya, yet, in asmuch as the final true signification of the compound is found to be in the form in which we have explained it, the expounding also should be done in that way.
tasmādupapanaṃ piṅgācyādīnāṃ dravyavacanatvam /	And thus then, the real meaning of the compound citra guh comes to be that the man, Devadatta, is qualified by the cows as qualified by that Relationship.

vaidika śabdasyātibhārābhāvāt / tatra viniyogabalenāsya vastu sāmarthya sadbhāvānceṣaṇe yatiṣyāmahe /	For instance, we speak of a Class as citravyakti consisting of various kinds of individuals of a Sub stance as nanaguna having various qualities of a Quality as anēkāçraya having many substrates and of an Action as anēkā praya inhering in many substances. In all these cases the particular third object denoted by the Bahuvrihi compound is ascertained by means of the signification of another word spoken of as coextensive with the compound f.
na cātra vātantravārtike /	i. the word jätiḥ in the clause citravyáktiriyam jātiḥ .
kyabhedaḥ pratyayādyanyatamāvṛttilakṣaṇaḥ /	Objection It has been shown above Iiii that on account of Endlessness and Anomaly, the Individual can never be accepted as form ing the denotation of a word.
krayavākyasya bhedaṃ vibhāgalakṣaṇamabhyupagamyetyarthaḥ pṛthak bhavadākya bhedayatīti vākyabhedaḥ /	Reply That does not affect our position because even though there may be an endless number of Individuals, we could very well take a single generic character, upon which we would base the connection of the word with every individual having that character and in this there would be no anomaly.
etaduktaṃ bhavati yāvacchativākye vyāpriyete tāvatprakaraṇadharmatvaṃ nāsti / yadā tu vastuvisaṃvādāhihataśaktinī te nirvyāpāre bhaviṣyataḥ tadā prakaraṇa viniyogaiti /	That is to say, when the third object is found once to be marked by the Class itself, inasmuch as that generic character would be found to mark all Individuals forming that Class, through that generic character once cognised, every one of these Individuals, as differing from one another in time, place, etc., could very well be denoted by the word and as the word would never be used with reference to any indivi dual not marked by that generic character, there could be no anomaly.
ataśca padamevaitadvākyenaivaṃ vibhajyate /	In a case, however, where the Individuals are marked by other Individuals, there too, the basic characteristic is the generic character of the Class.
na tasyāyaṃ guṇaḥ śeṣaḥ sarvārthopyavadhāritaḥ tathā cāntareṇāpi matvarthoyaṃ dravyamāmānādhikaraṇyaṃ pratipadyante	And, howsoever far we may proceed, so long as we keep on the proper track of the series of qualifications, we shall always find the final basic generic character to be identically the same in the case of all individuals of the same Class and thus there would be nothing incongruous in con necting the word with every one of these Individuals.
śabdānāṃ na hi lopena vācyorthaḥ pratipādyate / tasmādubhayamāmarthyamevaṃ tatrāvagamyate	And in all such cases, it is the first and the last among the Individuals thus found to be pointed out by the word, that forms its real denotation and as for the intermediate ones, inasmuch as their cognition is brought about by indirect Indication, they are not accepted as directly denoted by the word.
rūpādīnāmapi ca nakṣaṇopapattermatupā vinā vṛttiḥ syāt / candanasya gandha iti vaccāntaraṇa bhāvapratyayaṃ gorarupaṇa ityapi prayogaḥ syāt / yathā ca gandhatvamityakte candanādisaṃbandhamapāsya tadviśeṣāṇāṃ gandhatvasaṃbandho bhavati /	Thus then, in the case in question, the classes Pingatva and Akshitva denoted by the two words forming the compound Pingakshi indicate their respective Individualsviz., the particular quality, and the portion of the eye and these two again indicate the Substance having such an eye and this Substance being the final thing pointed out becomes the denotation of the compound Pingäkshi .
evamarupātvamityapi dravyasaṃbandho na syāt /	Then there arises the question as to whether this denotation of the Substance is direct or indirect being only indicated.
pādiśabdavadeva cāruṇāḍherapi dravyasāmānādhikaraṇyaṃ na syā, dyo hi manyate lakṣaṇayāmpādiṣu sāmānādhikaraṇyamiti tasya rūpādiṣvapi tathaiva svādaruṇatvādiṣu vā, na hite kiṃ cidrapyadhikaṃ vadanti / etenārutvādibhyo matublopaprasaṃktirvyākhyātā /	Some people the grammarians hold that, just as in the case of the Deific Nominal Affixes, the matup affix, and the like, so in the present case also, the Substance is directly denoted by the compound because it is actually cognised as the predominant factor because there is coextensive ness and because of the grammatical rule anēkamanyapadārthaḥ. While others the Logicians make the following declaration In the case of the Deific Nominal Affixes in the word Aindra f.i., we find that the additional factor admitted into the word Indra does not serve any other purpose and hence we take that as denoting the other object the material dedicated to Indra specially as in this case that object is not capable of being indicated by the basic noun Indra, because of this giving rise to an anomaly, and also because, as a matter of fact, the basic noun Indra does not signify that other object. In the case of the Bahurrihi compound, however, we find that the two words retain their own original significations that there is no additional factor admitted into the words and that the necessary idea of the Substance is afforded by the classes Pingatva and Akshitva by Indi cation based upon the necessary concomitance of these with the Substance and hence we cannot very reasonably admit the fact of the Substance being directly denoted by the compound.
nanu guṇavacanānāmāśrayato liṅgavacanāni bhavantītyevaṃ setyati/	But what has been said here cannot be accepted as applying to all the compounds. For instance, it might apply to the Kamadhāraya com pound, where there is every possibility of Indication because the classes nilatva and kamalatva inhere in the same object, which can very well be indicated by the compound made up of the two words nila and kamala.
na, rūpādiśuklatvādiyvapi prasaṅgāt /	But the Quality of Redness, having no action of itself, and being altogether immaterial, could not be connected with the Purchase as its means.
api ca /	Sutra .
guṇavacana iti na guṇābhidhānamātreṇoccate/	Against the declaration that the word aruṇā being denotative of a quality, cannot be connected with the verb purchase,the following argument is urged The word is not denotative of a quality.
na hyanyathā vacanaśabdaḥ prayujyate /	Nor can it be urged that the word would signify the substance by means of indirect Indication.
vacanameva svarūpaṃ śabdasthetyevaṃ gaṇaśabdenaiva vyavahāra siddheḥ / ata eva rūpādīnāmagrahaṇam /	Some people hold the coordination of the word aruna with substantives to be based upon Indication but such coordination would be possible in the case of the word rūpa, as also in that of the word arunatva because these words also do not express anything more than mere properties.
etena matublopavākyaṃ vyākhyātam /	This also sets aside the possibility of the elimination of the matup affix in the case of the word arunatva.
tasmād dravyavacano 'ruṇāśabdaḥ, tasya ca kārakatvābhidhānopapatterekavākyatvasiddhiḥ / ato na sarvadharmatvamiti / tadetadapeśala mityākṛtyadhikaraṇoktanyāya visaṃvādādaśobhanamityabhiprāyam /	Then again, no properties are ever connected with Gender, Num ber,etc. hence also, inasmuch as we find the words çuklaḥ, arună,etc. connected with particular Genders and Numbers, we must admit them to be denotative of substances. Nor can it be urged that we have the rule that the Genders and Numbers of guṇavacanas or adjectives are ‘based upon their substantive substrates because if it were so, then we could have Genders and Numbers even in such words as rüpa, çuklatva and the like, and also because the word guna vacana in the said rule does not mean the words that merely express properties, but those that having expressed u property, denote a substance for if it were not so, the word vacana would be wholly superfluous because the form of the word is nothing other than its vacana utterance and as such the former sense could be got at by means of the word guna alone hence it is the addition of the word vacana that serves to preclude such words as ripa and the like.
ekāntadravyasaṃbandhini tāva viśeṣaṇatvātpūrvataramabhihite tatsaṃbandhādeva pratīyamānasya dravyasya na śakyaṃ vācyatvaṃ kalpayitumityaktam	is also amenable to the same explanation as there also we have the expression gunavacana. For these reasons we conclude that the word aruṇā denotes a sub stance and hence inasmuch as it can very well be spoken of as an agent, it can be construed along with the sentence in which it occurs and thus having its denotation based upon Syntactical Connection, it leaves no room for the operation of the Context as held by the Purva pakshi and as such the word cannot be taken as qualifying every thing mentioned in the Context.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	The reply to the above argument is that it is not very satisfactory that is to say, it is not compatible with the conclusion arrived at under the Akṛtyadhikarana Iiii.
nanu guṇāntarotpattikāle anyadeva dravyamiti na vyabhica ret	Then again, it is only when a certain meaning is never found to abandon a word, either by agreement or difference, that that meaning is acknowledged as the directly expressed denotation of that word and in the case in question we find that the word aruna never abaudons the property of Redness.
yādṛśaṃ tvatmābhirdravyamabhihitaṃ tādṛśasya sarvatra guṇamātrameva bhidyate na svarūpam ataścākṛtivyavahārāddūre sthūnatarīyamityapeśalatā	And in such cases, the Property, connected in separably with a substance, having been previously denoted, as forming the qualification, the substance would be implied by the mere relation ship of that qualification and hence this substance could never be accepted as forming the expressed denotation of the word as we have already shown above under the Akrtyadhikaraṇa.
agnirmāṇavaka ityatrāgnimāṇavakayo ratyantabhedātmādṛśyeka śabdaḥ pravartamānaḥ pratyayavainacaṇyānnābhivāteti sarveṇa jñāyate /	Then again, on account of the irregularity of usage, a substance can not be accepted as the direct denotation of the word ‘aruṇā because the word is found to be used with reference to other substances with the property of Redness, and to be not used with reference to the former substance, when it happens to be devoid of that property.
ye tu jātiguṇavacanā bhūtvā dravyaṃ pratyāyayanti teṣāmabhidheyantra cya māṇavastunorvivekābhāvātpratītā va pya vivekaḥ sthita eva, sa kathaṃ cidanvayavyatirekābhyāṃ nipuṇaiḥ parīkṣakairapanīyataiti /	It might be argued that, inasmuch as at the time of the appearance of another property, the substance also becomes changed, the said irregularity loses its force. But as a matter of fact, there is no such absolute rule as that the substance becomes changed because, as a matter of fact, it is found that even while the substance remains the same, various properties are found to appear and disappear. There are two theories on the point of the appearance of new pro perties in a substanceThe first is that of the Paitharas, who hold that the black pot itself becoming cooked in the fire, takes the red colour and in accordance with this theory, the substance remains the same.
na ca parīkṣakāṇāmanabhidheyatvaṃ vadatāṃ lokavirodhaḥ / pratotamātravyavahārī hi lokobhi dhānanaca gāvivekamakurvannuḍhāsīnāvasthaḥ sāmānya viśeṣabādhādisiddhyarthaṃ parocakaviveka kriyamāṇaṃ na nānumanyate /	Another theory is that of the Pailukas, who hold that the cooking is in the atoms composing the pot and in this theory also, the said irregu larity would pertain to these atoms. In the way that we have explained in Çlokāvartika the nature of the substance, it cannot but be admitted that what undergoes the change is the Property, and not the substance itself. In a case where a particular substance, the jar, is reddened by the colour of another substance, the Redchalk,the former is spoken of as red though the property of Redness inheres in the sub stance the chalk connected with it and in this case, inasmuch as a single substance would come to be spoken of by many such words as Blue, Yellow and the like if all these were to be denotative of sub stances,this would be a distinct irregularity.
ta smāda virodhaḥ /	And thus there would be no transgression in the matter.
kathaṃ na rūpāḍhiśabdeṣvapi te lakṣapāyā matublopaḥ, kathaṃ vā jaṭāṇāvṛttiḥ śāstreṇa nvā khyāyata itya nābhidhīyate	Then, as for the questionsWhy cannot you admit of the elimi nation of the matup, as based upon Indication, in the case of the word Rūpa also ? and How can the explanatory rule pertain to Indication? we offer the following explanation There are three sorts of Indications one that is well established by eternal usage, just as well as Direct Deuotation one that is created at the time and there is one class that cannot be admitted on account of their incapability.
ica keṣu ciḍhartheṣvabhidhānavadeva naṇāśaktirapyanādikālapravṛttatvena nirūḍhā yathāśakkādiṣu /	That is to say, there are certain words in which the Indicative potency is as eternally established as the Denotative, e.g., the words çukla, aruna and the like.
keṣu cittu kriyate yathā rathāṅganāmā cakrabāka iti /	There are some which are used now “adays, in the indirect indicative sense, c.g., the word Rathānganāman as applied to the Cakravāka bird the Rathangapart of a chariot being the wheel which, as expressed by the word Cakra, forms a por tion of the name Cakraväka.
keṣu citpunaḥ kartumapi na śakyate yathā śavdatyarśarūparasagandheṣu / kathaṃ punarihā viśiṣṭe saṃ badhe sati na jakṣayeti /	While there are certain words which are wholly incapable of having any indicative potency such are the words Rupa, Rasa,etc. Then to the questionThe relationship of the substance with Rupa being exactly of the same kind as that with Çukla, how is it that there is no Indication in the case of the former?the reply is, it is just as in the case of denotation.
yathā bha vataḥ samāne guṇabhavdatve śakkādonāṃ guṇopasarjanadravya vacanatvaṃ na rūpādīnāmevaṃ mama nati/	That is to say, according to you also, though both the words Rūpa and Çukla are equally expressive of properties, yet it is only the latter, and not the former, that is expressive of a substance with a property as its subordinate element and in the same manner, we admit of Indication in the case of Çukla, and not in that of Rūpa.
abhidhānaśaktiḥ khābhāviko lakṣaṇā tu na saṃbandhādadhikaṃ nimittamapekṣataiti /	Against this it might be urged that the Denotative potency of a word belongs to it naturally which is not the case with Indication, which depends upon such agencies as that of the Relationship,etc. But it would be so in the case of words newly coined like Dittha etc..
yaddacchāśabdatve etadevaṃ syāt / tava tu śuklādīnāṃ samaveta gupadvāreṇa dravye vṛttiḥ /	You, however, hold the word Cukla to apply to the sub tance, through a property inhering in it and as this is found to be pres ent in the case of the word Rupa also, this latter would also become applicable to the substance.
tattvaviśiṣṭaṃ rūpādiṣvapīti dravye vṛttiprasaṅgaḥ / tatrāvaśyaṃ guṇagataḥ kaścitsāmarthyabhedoṅgīkarttavyaḥ /	Consequently it must be admitted that in Properties there are different kinds of potentialities, whereby only certain words expressive of it pertain to the substance bearing that property, while others pertain to the Property alone as the predominant factor. And this would be the case with Indication also.
yena te śabdāḥ ke cideva guṇiparā bhavanti anye gupradhānā, evaṃ jayamapi bhaviṣyati	Thus then, just as words have diverse potentialities with regard to Denotation, so, in the same manner, should the meanings also be admit ted to have various potentialities appertaining to the indicated meaning.
satyapi ca phanānumeye dṛśyamānārthapratyāyana sāmaye, satyapi cāsmākamapyadṛṣṭaśaktigauravatulyatve, abhidheyamātrapratyayena nivṛttavyāpāre śabderthapratyaye cākṛtārthe sati kalpyamānatvādarthaśaktiḥ pramāṇavatī na śabdaśaktiḥ /	Though the potentiality of denoting a visible object is to be inferred from its effects, and as such the necessity of admitting an imperceptible poten cy is equally present for both of us i.e., the Denotative and the Indica tive Potencies being both equally imperceptible, and the function of the word having ceased with the denotation of the expressed meaning, yet, when this last expressed meaning is not found to be quite fully established, it leads to the assumption of a peculiar potency in this meaning, and not in the word, which points to the indicated meaning and this assumption is quite warranted by the exigencies of the circum stances. And on the mere ground of having to assume imperceptible potentialities, both theories are equal. Thus then, there being no Indicative potency in the word Rupa, it can never be applied to substances, without the matup affix.
pradhānatvāpradhānatvapratītiratu dravyaguṇayoḥ svābhāviko nityaṃci rūpādiṣu svaprādhānyenābhidhīyamāneṣu dravyaṃ viśeṣatvenocate śukādiṣu viśeṣyavenā, ta eva cānādikāla prasiddārthatvādasyā lakṣaṇāyā matubnopānāne nānugamaḥ	As a matter of fact also, we do not find that the substance is never signified by the cognition of Rupa etc., for we actually find that the Rupa points to the substance as its invariable concomitant, just as the smoke points to the fire all that we mean is that the word Rūpa itself not pertaining to the substance, there is no Indication in this case. Between the Substance and the Property, whether it is the one or the other that is cognized as the predominant element depends upon their nature and in the case of Rupa etc., we find that they are always denoted as the predominant factors and hence in such cases the sub stance is signified merely as a qualifying subsidiary whereas in the case of the word Çukla and the like, the substance is expressed as the quali fied predominant factor. It is on account of this indicative signification having continued from the very beginning of things that it is explained by means of the explanatory grammatical rule laying down the elim.
etāvāṃstu viśeṣotra yatrāpi viśeṣaṇam / viśeṣyaeva śaktatve śuklo dravyaviśeṣaṇam	That Indication, however, which has a more recent origin, and is not so well established, cannot be explained by means of special rules laid down in the Çastras because even without such a rule, it is found out through other factors connected with it.
tenaitasya dirūpatvaṃ gandhādarekarūpatā /	As for instance, in the case of the expression Madhuro rasaḥ snigdhaḥ,etc. taste, they cannot qualify this latter and as such they are taken as qualifying the substance characterized by taste.
tathā ca śuqa ityasya punaranyā dvirūpatā	And thus the presence of the Gender and Number in the word arūṇayā could be explained, as before, through the substratum of the redness.
paṭasya śukla ityatra niṣkṛṣṭo guṇa āditaḥ / paṭaḥ śukta iti tvatra dravyanī nobhidhīyate	Nor do the Gramma rians specify and enumerate the properties as they base their use of the names Property and Substance on the actually perceived relation ship of the container and the contained. Thus, as a matter of fact, it is the word Çukla, and not the word Rūpa, that signifies the sub servient substance and thus there can be no irregularity in the matter of Gender and Number.
yathā karuṇābuddhiśabdayoḥ /	It is with a view to this argument that the Bhishya has made the declarationWe find even such words as are expressive of properties to have the feminine gendere.g., the words Karuna Buddhiḥ, and the like.
gandhādi śabda tucyāvapi caitau pradarśanamātra viśeṣa dudāhṛtau /	Though as a matter of fact these words are similar in character to the word ‘gandha, yet they have been cited only with a view to show that such words take the feminine gender.
etaduktaṃ bhavati yepi tāvatsvapradhā naguvacanāstepi kathaṃ ciliṅga saṃkhyābhyāṃ yujyante kiṃ punaryeṣu dravyaprādhānyam / evamanayā yuktyārupoti guṇavacanaḥ /	The sense of this is that even those words that express selfpredominant Properties are found to take partcular Genders and Numbers what then can be said against the pres ence of these in the case of such words as preeminently signify sub stances ? For these reasons, the word aruṇā must be taken as expressive of a property and as such it cannot be connected with the verb to purchase. The position being thus summed up, the opponent comes forward with the following objectionIf the word aruṇayā is not connected with the verb to purchase, it could very well be connected with the ēkahayani oneyearold.
śakyate hi guṇavacanasya dravyasaṃbandhaḥ kartum /	As it is quite possible for a word expressing a property to be connected with a substance.
siddhāntavāḍhī tu śrutyā kriyāsaṃbandhāvagamāt dravyasaṃbandho vākyalakṣaṇo durbalatvādvādhyataityetatpratipādayitumāha	The reply to this is that the connection of Redness with the verb is expressed by Direct Declaration, while that with the Substance is ex pressed by Syntactical Connection and as such, this latter being weaker is set aside in favour of the former.
nāpi ṣaṣṭhīśrutirasti tasmāttṛtīyāśrutibanīyastvāt na dravyaguṇayoḥ saṃbandha iti	Thus then, inasmuch as “the word arunā signifies the Property alone, and the word ‘ēkahāyani the Substance alone, there can be no direct verbal coextensiveness between them nor do we find any genitivo ending consequently on account of the authoritative character of the Instrumental ending in aruṇayā, we cannot admit of any relationship between the Property and the Sub stance in the case in question.
kevalāruṇavācitvaṃ liṅgādyadyapi gamyate / tathāpyagatito vākyāta taṇāvṛttirāśritā	being nothing to point to it, says Even though there is no genitive ending, yet the coextensiveness between aruṇā and ēkahāyanī is distinctly expressed by the fact of both words having the same caseending the Instru mental.
tatrāpyagatyaiva pratyavasthānam / nanu guṇāsṭya kiyāsaṃbandhābhāvāditi /	The reply to this is that what the opponent says is not possible,etc. That is to say, our declaration is based upon the comparative strength of the means of cognition for instance, the basic word aruna is found, by its natural capability, to be expressive of a property while its coexten siveness with ‘ēkahāyani is based upon its proximity to another word and certainly there is a deal of difference between the authoritative strength of these two means of signification.
na hyagatyānabhidheyorthaḥ śakyaḥ pratyetum /	That is to say, it being not possible for the Property to be related either to the Action or to its accessories, in order to save the word expressing it from being wholly meaningless, we must take it as related to the word ēkahayani, which also saves us from syntactical split ..
paramvāha niṅgasaṃkhyāvāśrayadvāraprāptaṃ kārakamanadya prātipadikārtho vidhāyataiti /	In reply to this, it is pointed out that the relationship of aruṇā with the Action is expressed by the Direct Signification of the Instrumental ending in aruṇayā, while that with the Substance could at best be got at by indirect Indication and as such this latter could not but give way to the former, which is more authoritative.
asti hotadapi darśanaṃ yadguṇaśabdebhyo vināpi kārakatvena kārakaviśeṣaṇatvād dvitīyādayo bhavantīti/	Against this again we have yet another objection, based upon the inevitable character of the said Indirect Indication The Property not being capable of bearing a relationship with the Action, no significance can be attached to the caseending in arunaya.
naitatkāra miti /	The reply to this is,That would make the Instrumental ending wholly meaningless.
nacaca kriyāsaṃbandhavibhaktivadguṇa saṃbandhavibhaktiḥ ṣaṣṭhī dṛśyate	That is to say, no amount of inevitable necessity can make that cognised which is not expressed by the word.
ye tu sāmānādhikaraṇṭā vikalyāstāna niyamo vaikārye hītyatra pa ṣṭhāntyādhikaraṇace sarvāneva vakṣyāmaḥ / sarvathā nāyaṇika sāmānādhikaraṇyamiti durbalam	Nor can the Instrumental ending in aruṇaya be justified and explained, through Indication, like the Accusative in saktün in the sentence saktun juhoti, where saktūn is taken as equivalent to saktubhiḥ, on account of the fact of the saktu not being something to be accomplished, and as such incapable of taking the Accusative ending because the Property expressed by the basic word arunā being incorporeal, it is not capable of the character of any sort of agency denoted by the caseendings i.e., all caseendings are equally inapplicable to it.
sarvatra tu bādhite padārthaiti koyamupanyāsaḥ / ucyate	Says the opponentThe word aruṇayā might be taken as laying agency obtained through its substrate which is endowed with a particu lar Gender and Number.
aruṇā śabdastāvadavaṇyameva kena cid guṇinā saṃbandhanīyaḥ tatra padāntarasaṃbandhepi sakṛtpravṛttāyāḥ kimavaguṇṭhanene tivattasya tāvatyeva śrutipīḍeti / ato guṇapadenāpi saṃbadhyatāmiti /	As there is a theory current among Gram marians that even though the words expressing properties are devoid of the character of agents, yet, inasmuch as they serve to qualify such agents, they take the various caseendings, the Accusative,etc. ReplyThere is not much in this argument. Though the word aruṇaya might, somehow or other, be capable of being related to the ‘ēkahāyanī, yet inasmuch as the ekahāyani would be taken up by the Action of Purchase,, and it would not be possible for it to be related to both the Action of Purchase and the Property of Redness,as shown under Sutra Iiv,its relationship with the Action, being more authoritative, sets aside that with the Property because while we find the caseending the Instrumental expressive of its relationship with the Action, we do not find the genitive caseending that would signify its relationship to the Property.
na ca vidhīyamānāvasthaḥ krayaḥ prasiddha iti prakaraṇagataika cāyanīmātrasaṃbandhaprasaṅgaḥ	In the case of the sentence nilamut palam that has been cited by the opponent, there being no contradiction of Direct Assertion, there is a cognition of the relationship pointed out by Syntactical Connection and as such its case is not analogous to that of the sentence in question.
paraḥ punarekacāyanī vairū pyābhyupagamavāda labdhaprasaraḥ śaṅkate/	As for the several alternatives with regard to coextensiveness, we shall explain them in the last Adhikarana of the sixth Adhyaya, under Sūtra VIviii.
na cānarthakyaṃ prakaraṇerthavattvāt / tatrāpyevameva saṃbandha iti cet na, vākyāntaraprāptadravyānavādana guṇavidhai/	In any case, however, the coextensiveness can only be based upon Indication and as such it cannot but be very much less authoritative. Nor do words expressive of Properties take the caseendings, be cause they qualify other agents but because they are themselves agents.
evaṃ prāptebhidhīyate	This too we shall explain under the Adhikaraṇa Vi.
arthekatveti vākyaviśeṣopalakṣaṇam /	The sense of the latter sentence in all cases it is only after the wordmeanings have been rejected,etc. is that the independence of wordmeanings is in every way rejected and hence there is no incongruity in the assumption of many relationships of the same word.
aikakarmyāditi punastadeva hetutvenopadiṣṭam /	Then as for the word ekahayani, the independence of this also has been set aside by the fact of its being related to the Action of Purchase.
atha vā vākyārthaikatve yatraikavākyatā saṃbhavatītyarthaḥ	And then, if the word be connected with another word, that would entail no further contradiction of Direct Assertion,in accordance with the maxim that when once a woman has shown her face, there is no use cover ing it again.
tasmānna dravyasaṃbandhaḥ kārakasyāti kasya cit	Hence when a word has been connected with one word, there is no incongruity in its being connected with another word and hence the word ekahayani can very well be connected with the word aruṇā also, which expresses a property.
na cāpyanyonyasaṃbandhe vidhireṣāṃ pravartate /	The reply to this isIt is not so,etc. Bhashya, p. , . .
tadadhīnā vayaṃ ceti kriyā saṃbandhakalpanā yathā ca dravyamicchanti sādhakatvena karmaṇām/	In this reply, the Bhāshya admits, for the sake of argument, the rela tionship of the Property with the Substance and then points out that, even then, there is a contradiction inasmuch as it involves the rejec tion of the relationship of the Property with the Substance employed in the sacrifice and the simultaneous attributing, to the verb krināti, of the contradictory characters of the Injunction and the Descriptive Refer ence.
tathā guṇamapītyevaṃ nāruṇya yā nyasaṃgatiḥ tathā guṇaviśeṣeṇa dravyaṃ yāvadalakṣitam / tāvattena kriyāsiddhirnāstyatopecyate guṇāḥ tasmātmopi kriyāṅgamiti /	In a case where all words tend to qualify the verb, there is no trouble involved in the Injunction of the qualified Action but in a case where what is enjoined is the Action, and also a little of the Substance, if we admit a syntactical split in the shape of a repetition of the verbal Injunctive affix,we have an absence of all restriction. That is to say, a qualification is always such as is already well known and does not require an Injunction consequently while the Purchase is still in the state of being enjoined, it cannot be said to be well known, and as such it would be connected with every oneyearold thing that may be found to be mentioned in the context and not only with that with which the Soma is purchased.
tathā ca dravyaguṇasaṃskāre dhviti guṇagrahaṇaṃ kṛtam/	And whichsoover these other oneyearold ones may be, in the context treating of the Jyotishtoma, to each of them would the Property of Redness be related, by means of syntactical con nection.
nanu nāntarīyakatvād dravyagrahaṇe guṇānuṣṭhānāt pṛthakaprayatnābhāvād na dravyavadguṇāpekṣā yuktā tathā hi karmaṇyapi kute pūrvaṃ na dravyeṇa prayojanam /	If, however, we do not find any other oneyearold thing men tioned in the context, then what else could we do than admit such a thing to form part of the sacrificial gift, or to be in the shape of the cow that is kept tethered in the sacrificial house? Or it may be that inasmuch as the word ekahayanya does not form the predicate of the sentence, and as such no significance attaches to the particular gender and number, the word may be taken as pointing to any thing that may be a year old male or female, and as such would refer to the animals of the savaniya “and the Agnîshoma and thus there would be no definito certainty as to which oneyearold thing is meant to be qualified by arunā.
tathā hi	This argument applies to all similar cases e.g.
guṇānāmevamātmatvaṃ sarvatra hyavadhāritam / nānyathā niṣkriyatvācca vidheścaivamanugracāt	Nor would the word aruṇā become useless without such qualification because it has its use else where in the context. Nor can it be urged that the Property would not be related with the context, just as it has been shown to be not related with Ēkahāyani. Because if the Property be laid down with reference to a Substance mentioned in another sentence, there is no undue diver sity in the character of anything.
na caika svarūpaiva sarveṣāṃ sādhanatā/	And lastly, as for the relationship with the Substance, the Injunctive is ever incapable of establishing any such relationship.
na ca svasamavāyinyeva kevalā calanātmikā vā kiyā sarvaneṣyate / na ca pradhānakriyāyāḥ sarvāṇayeva sākṣātsādhanāni bhavanti	no karaku or agent can have any relationship with a Substance all karakas equally are fully established entities, and as such they do not stand in need of one another and as for Properties, inasmuch as they are all equally subservient to others, there can be no mutual dependence among themselves the Injunction in question too does not operate towards the pointing out of a mutual relationship among the kärakas and inasmuch as we are guided wholly by the Injunction, we accept the relationship with the action.
tatraiṣāṃ kartṛtvāditaraca karaṇatvaṃ bhaviṣyati /	And of such factors as the specifying of the Substance and though nominatives to this operation of specification, they become Instrumental to the other operations hence the Instrumental ending.
te nāruṇapadāṭetāvaḍhavagataṃ kiṃ cid dravyaṃ paricchindatāruṇaguṇena krayaḥ sādhayitavya iti /	Thus then it is from the word aruṇayā itself that it is concluded that the Purchase in question is to be accomplished by means of the Property of Redness as specifying a certain Substance.
tathaika hāyanyāpya, nyathā sādhanatvāsaṃbhavātkena cid guṇena me paricchedaḥ kartavya ityetāvaḍhapekṣate / taguṇaṇe yatkiṃcit dravyaṃ paricchedyamāśrayatvenāpekṣitumārabhate dravyamapi yaṃ kaṃ cid guṇām /	In the same manner the oneyearold animal also stands in need of a property that would specify it as without such specification it could not be employed in the action. Consequeutly, we find that the Property begins to look for a Substance to specify, which would also serve as its own substrate and in the same manner the Substance also begins to look for a specifying property and the relationship based upon such mutual requirements is established very soon. And in the sentence in question, we find that it is not possible for any other Substance or Property to be sought after hence even without the genitive affix, we accept these two Redness and the oneyearold animal to be related to each other, on the sole ground of mutual requirements just as two men, one of whom had his cart burnt, and another had his horse dead, having joined together in making up a joint cart, proceeded on their way.
ubhayāpekṣā jāṇaśca saṃbandhaḥ śīghraṃ nirvartyate /	Specially as there is no ground for rejecting what is found near at haud, we conclude that the two cannot but be related between themselves.
na ca dravyāntara guṇāntarāṇāmatra vākye māpekṣatvaṃ pratīyate sannihitātikramakāraṇābhāvādaṣṭayevameva vijñāyate /	If the Purchase had its Substance and Property not definitely men tioned, then, in that case, it could admit of extraueous factors. If, how ever, the action of Purchase were forcibly connected with such Substances and Properties as it does not stand in need of, then it would not be per formed in the way that it is enjoined as it is enjoined as qualified by the definite Substance of the oneyearold Animal and the definite property of Reduess. Secondly, it would involve an unwarranted repetition of the Principal Action.
kiṃ ca	would be contracted.
yannāma guṇonyathānupapatteraśrutaṃ dravyamānayati tatkrayaḥ śrutaika hāyanīdravyakatvānna pratīcchati kāṃsyabhojinyāyena vā mukhyopyaniyamaṃ vārayet kimuta mukhya eva sanna vā śrutakalpanā vinānupapattiḥ/	And further, because the Purchase is the principal action, therefore it precludes the implication of other extrancous sub stances and Properties by the mentioned Substance and Property. Any such irregularity would be rejected by the action, even if it were a sub. ordinate action just as even though the Pupil is subordinate to the Tutor, yet if it becomes necessary for the former to eat out of a vessel of the Kansyu metal, it behoves the latter also to cat of the same, when the Pnpil has as & vrata to eat of what is left by his Tutor.
yathā vakṣyati /	And it is all the more so, when the Action is the principal one.
na śruti vākyārtho neti / tathā hi kraya eva hi dravyaṃ gṛhṇannevamapekṣate ko guṇa etatpara kelya tīti /	Nor, in the case in question, do we find anything incompatible or incongruous, in the absence of an assumption of something not mentioned in the sentence because all that is necessary is supplied by the men tioned Substance and Property as related to each other and in this way also becomes established the fact of the two being coextensive. Nor is there any contradiction of Direct Assertion, in this case,as will be shown by the Bhashya later on, in the sentence ca grutir väkyärthō nëti &e.
guṇamapi gṛhṇannapekṣate kiṃ dravyametāśrayo bhaviṣyatīti/	That is to say, when the Purchase takes up the Substance, it seeks after the Property that would specify that Substance and when it takes the Property, it seeks for the Substance that would be the substrate of that Property.
tenaiva tayoḥ krayavaśenānyonyānuguṇyaṃ pratipadyamānayorapi na parasparāṅgāṅgitvaṃ bhavati /	Thus then, inasmuch as the two are found to be quite compatible with one another, through the action of Purchase, they become related to each other by the relationship of mutual subserviency.
yastu manyate paricchedakatvād guṇasya dravyāṅgatvaṃ pratīyataiti /	Some people hold that, inasmuch as the Property serves to specify the Substance, it is subservient to this latter.
sa vaktavyo guṇasyāpi kra yamanyathā sādhayitumaśaknuvato dravyamāśrayatvaṃ pratipadyamānamaṅgamiti /	But to them we reply that the Substance also becomes subservient to the Property, inasmuch as ou ae count of its incapability of otherwise aiding in the accomplishment of the Purchase, it becomes the substrate of that Property.
tasmātkrayāṅgabhūtayoreva nāntarīyakaḥ parasparopakāro bhavannāṅgatvamāpādayatīti draṣṭavyam/	Hence it must be ad mitted that both of them are subservient to the Purchase and that between them there is always present a mutual help consequently they must be regarded as subservient to each other.
yastu prakaraṇe niveśaṃ manyate tasya kena guṇo vidhīyataiti vaktavyam /	One who holds that the Property of Redness pertains to the whole context, should explain by what that Property is enjoined. He does not admit the fact of its bearing any relationship to the Injunction of Purchase. Then as for the Recapitulatory Injunctive sentence, that rould not but neglect the Property, which, not being an action, could not be taken up by that sentence.
tāvatsadda naiva saṃbandha iṣṭaḥ	Nor can they ever operate towards the properties of substances. And hence the property in question cannot in any way pertain to the whole context.
na ca vikalpo nānākāryatvādityavāntaravyāpārābhiprāyeṇa / parastu pradhānakāryanānātvamevoktamiti matvāha nancidānīmeboktamiti /	Another reply is that there is actually no possibility of their being optional alternatives because they have distinct functionsthat is to say, they differ in the intermediate operations. The opponent however takes this latter sentence to be an admission of a difference in the Principal Function served by them and hence comes forward with the following You have just declared that they serve only one function and then what you say now also contradicts a previous declaration of yours, that the Property, being incorporeal, can have no function.
taccāpi viruddhaṃ yatpūrvamuktamamūrtatvāniṣkriyo gupaiti	It might be argued that this latter declaration has been made by “the Pūrvapakshi, and as such it is not proper to taunt the Siddhānti with its contradiction.
saṃdehaḥ kriyate sarvaḥ sādhāraṇapade sthitaiḥ tatra cāmūrtatoktaṃti siddhānte pi viruṣyate	But then the question to be dealt with is always expounded from a common standpoint,and it was in course of the expounding of the question that the incorporeality and the consequent inoperativeness of the Property was declared and the contradiction of this would certainly vitiate the Siddhanta also. the Property and the Substance serving the same purpose, and thereby speaks of the Property as operative, he certainly becomes open to the charge of selfcontradiction.
parihate doṣahaye vastukṛtameka hāyanohāratvamapaśyanvākyenaiva dvāradvārisaṃbandhakaraṇādvaisṛṣṭāpattiṃ codayati /	Thus then the two anomaliesof selfcontradiction, and optional alternativeshaving been set aside, the opponent finds himself unable to perceive anything in the nature of the oneyearold animal, whereby it could serve as the said channel and consequently having concluded the said relationship to be pointed out by syntactical connection alone, brings forward the objection that in that case the oneyearold animal would have the double character of the Subject and the Predicate, as urged before.
evaṃ tati /	This objection is expressed in the sentence evantarki &c.
na brūmoruṇāśabda iti sāmarthya kārita mekacāyanī muṃbandhaṃ darśayati /	In reply to this, the Bhashya says nu brūmö vayam &c.,the sense of which is that the relationship of the Property to the oneyearold animal is due to the natural capacity of things.
nanvevamapi vākyaṃ bhidyeteti niyamanirākaraṇārthamāha gargaśatada•ṇḍanadomābhiṣavabhakṣavaditi parikṣāraḥ /	Then the opponent proceeds to deny the Restricted Relationship Thus too there would be a syntactical split that is to say, even though there may be a relationship with Purchase, yet as there would be a distinct action with each agent or karaku, there would certainly be a syntactical split due to this difference among the actions.
na nu daṇḍasya daeḍdyasaṃskāratvābhojanādivatpratigargamāvṛttiḥ prāpnoti / naiṣa tu doṣaḥ	The opponent again urges It is true that what we have urged does not contaminate your position but in this manner the Purchase could be effected even by an oneyearold animal that is not red, as also by a red animal that is nol oneyear old. The reply to this is that when the action of Purchase is the principal factor, the sentence has its end in the aggregating of all the various qualifications mentioned in the sentence i.e.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Objection Inasmuch as the Fine serves to purify the person fined, it must be repeated with reference to each person in the Garga com munity, just as the feeding pertains to each of the persons mentioned.
aparādhe nimitte hi śatasaṃkhyā viśeṣitā / tadanuṣṭhātrapāḍhānā rājñāṃ vṛttirvidhīyate	Reply This does not touch our position because it is only in the case of corporeal punishment that it pertains to each individual whereas the punishment of a fine of goldpieces applies to the whole community because the sentence in question lays down the fine as a source of income to the King, qualified by the number hundred, as received from the criminal, on account of a certain crime committed.
yaśvāsāvaparādho gargaṃkṛtaḥ sa eka kaṭaṃ konekakartṛko vā rājñaḥ śatādānanimittaṃ bhavati / tatkāle cāparādhināmapādānatvenāvasthāmātma mastagargāpāṭhānakaṃ rājñāśataṃ grahītavyamityavagate sati pratyekaṃ grahaṇe sati ekena śatenāparādha miṣkraye kṛte śeṣamaśrutaṃ brahmasvaharaṇaṃ syātsaṃkhyāgataraṃ ca vṛdvāvāpadadyeta /	That is to say, just as the sacrificial gift given to the Priests is in ex change of the services rendered by them in the performance of the sacri fice so is the fine a conditional income provided for the King, in exchange of the protection and as distinct fines are laid down for distinct crimes. the number hundred forming the Predicate of the sentence, we can not but attach dno significance to the singular number in çatam and as for the crime committed by Gargāḥ, whether it be committed by an indi vidual Garga, or by the whole community, it becomes an occasion of the income of a hundred pieces of gold to the King and at that time the crimi nals appearing in the position of the source from which the income pro ceeds, the sentence comes to mean that the King should receive a hundred pieces of gold from the whole Garga community and then if he were to receive a hundred from each individual, the crime having been fully ex piated by the payment of a single hundred, the acceptance of the other hundreds would be an unwarranted forcible taking away of the belongings of Brāhmaṇas and the number also would far exceed the enjoined one hundred.
tasmātmamuḍhāye vākyaparisamāptiḥ	Consequently the sentence must be taken as ending in the wholeThough distinct reasons have been given, yet the opponent brings forward another doubt, aroused by the aforesaid instances There being pro instances, how is it ascertained that the Sentence ends in the agyreyat”.
krayasya yāgasādhanasomaprāptyarthatvena bhūtabhavyasamuccāraṇanyāyena vidhāyakalāghavena ca prādhānyād dravyaguṇayośca pūrvahetu viparyayeṇa viparītatvāditara ekavākyatvapratipādanaphalaṃ prāpnoti /	Reply The Purchase being the Principal action,because of its serv ing the purpose of acquiring the some that would accomplish the sacrifice and because of the fact of that which is established being mentioned for the sake of that which has to be accomplished, and the Substance and the Property, for opposite reasons, having the contrary subordinate character. the former action comes to be taken along both of these latter. A Objection For fear of having to assume that which is not men tioned, we would have a restricted adjustment of even that Substance and that Property which are laid down in a separate sentence and as such, there is no special purpose served by taking them as forming the same sentence.
tatrāpara ha	and thus the vagueness and indefiniteness would remain there all the same.
ekatvayukta mekasya śrutisaṃyogāt	Consequently for the sake of a single specified Purchase, it is absolutely necessary to speak of all the three as syntactically connected in a single sentence. Sūtra It is qualified by singleness because singleness is distinctly mentioned.
evaṃ yathāsaṃyogaṃ śeṣaviniyogaḥ sthitaḥ	The application of the various accessories has been duly explained and now we proceed to consider the details of the employment of these accessories.
kimekasya grahasya saṃmārgaḥ uta prākaraṇika grahamātrasyeti /	and there arises a question as to whether the washing is to be of only one vessel, or of all the vessels mentioned in the context.
yathā caikatvayuktaṃ tathā dvitvavaḍatvayuktamapyudāhartavyam	Just as in this sentence we have a question as to the signifi cance of the singular number, so also in others, we have it as to that of the Dual and the Plural e.g. Yasya purolaçau kshayataḥ and Havin shi abhigharayati.
sarvaca va kiṃ ciduddiśya kriyā vidhīyate / tatroddiśyamānasya kiṃ saṃkhyā vivakṣyate uta neti saṃśayaḥ / nanu ca vedavākyeṣvayukloyaṃ vicāraḥ	In all these cases, an action is enjoined with refer ence to a particular thing and hence there naturally arises the question as to whether any significance is to be attached to the Number of the word signifying this thing or not. At the very outset, however, the following objection is raised “The discussion herein started is not quite proper with regard to Vedic sentences. Because, with the exception of the due comprehension of meaning, there is no other rivakshā Intention of the speaker to ex press and the Vedic sentences being eternal independent of a speaker, that which is found to be mentioned in them cannot but be taken as significant or meant to be expressive.
pratītivyatirekeṇa vivadyā'nyā na vidyate/	But in the case of Vedic sentonces, it is not possible that there should be any other meaning intended, or that there should be a mistake.
na ca vaktā yonyathātvaṃ kathaye, sarva puruṣāṇāmuktaṃ tu śabdapūrvatvamiti kevala śrotyāśrayaṇāt /	Nor is there a speaker, in this case, who could declare any other mean ing to be the one that was intended because all the men in the world are only hearers of the Veda, and not speakers, as has been shown under Sūtra Ii.
naca pramāṇāntaragamyortho yatastadaśena svayameva śrotāronyathātvaṃ pratipadyeran/	Nor is the subject treated of in the Veda amenable to other means of knowledge, on the strength of which the hearers them selves could take the sentence to have some other meaning.
vivakṣāvivaśce ca vaktṛṇāṃ pratyayaviśeṣāviṣkāni cchāviśeṣau vā tena vivakṣitamavivakṣitamiti dvayamapyetadallabhāvādanupapannam	Then, again, a certain meaning being intended or notinteuded is nothing more than two particular ideas, or two particular phases of wish or intention and hence neither of these two is possible in the case of Vedic sentences, where there is no speaker. Hence in all such cases, the acceptance or rejection is of that alone which is directly asserted or not asserted and there is no other ground for such acceptance or rejection. In fact, even in the case of human assertions, until the meaning desired to be conveyed has been ascertained, by other means of knowledge, to be something quite different, the meaning comprehended in the first instance is not rejected.
ucyate	SA To the above we make the following reply I.
ekatvaṃ tāvadacā saṃśayamuktaṃ tacca grahasaṃbandhītyetadapyasaṃdigdha, miha tu sarvārthānām	In the case in question there is no difference of opinion as to the comprehension of singleness, which all of us admit to be comprehended the question, however, is as to whether the singleness that is comprehended is meant to be enjoined predicated or not. There can be no doubt as to singleness being mentioned in the sentence in question nor is there any doubt as to its being related to the Graha Vessel.
prakṛtipratyayaśrutyoḥ svasvārthābhighātṛtvaṃ padasya kāraka vibhatīnāṃ ca viniyojakatvam	For instance , in the case of the original word and the aflix, they simply denote their respective objects the caseaffixes express its uses and the Injunctive, the Imperative and the Let endings have the power of enjoining.
sa hi yatra tayā pravartyate tatrābhihitenabhihite vā viniyukte 'viniyukte vā tulyavatpravartate	Consequently even if something happens to be distinctly expressed, or have its uses mentioned, when it comes to the consideration of its Injunction and actual performance, there always arises a question as to its being actually intended or not, as to be enjoined or not enjoined, and as to be performed or not performed.
na hyasāvanuṣṭhānaṃ prati tayorekayāpi preryate	Objection But this also is not possible without some sort of a wish on the part of some person.
tenābhihita viniyuktasyāpi vidhimanuṣṭhānaṃ ca prati vivakṣāvivakṣe vidhitmitā vidhimita cikīrṣitā cikīrṣitātmika bhavataḥ ucyate parigrahaparityāgāvicchāniṣkāphale sthite / sakajaṇārthatā tvatra syādivāvivakṣayoḥ	Reply By intention, we do not mean actual wish we take the two words Intention and Nonintention Viraksha and Acivaksha as in directly indicating their respective effects in the shape of Acceptance and Rejection. That is to say, just as the sentence külam pipatishati the riverbank wishes to fall down is prononuced only by a figurative attribut ing of the wish, based upon the extreme proximity of the falling,so, in the same manner, in the case of such sentences as do not originate from any person, the acceptance and rejection of what is laid down are always known to be the effects of what is known as Intention and Noninten tion in the case of ordinary assertions and it is on this Acceptance and Rejection that the present discussion is based.
kathaṃ śrutasyāparigrahaḥ syāditi cet / naiṣa doṣaḥ	Objection How could there be a rejection of that which is directly asserted? Reply This question does not affect the question because we have already said that acceptance depends upon Injunction and not upon mere Assertion.
yathaiva pauruṣeyeṣu puruṣohi pravartakaḥ / uktepyarthe tathaiveha niṅādirvidhibhaktitaḥ	And just as in the case of human assertions, it is the Person speaking that is the impeller or director, even in the case of something that is directly asserted,so in the case of Vedic sentences, the impel ling would be done by the Injunctive potency of the word. Because in the Voda it is the Injuuctive word that takes the place of the Director and the potency of the Injunctive that of the wish of that Director.
ato yadvidhitvena saṃspṛṣṭaṃ tatkartavyaṃ netaradityavadhārapādvidhivyāpāra saṃsparśaparimāṇamanceṣṭavyam	Conse quently it is admitted that that alone which is touched by the Injunction is to be performed, and nothing else and hence it becomes necessary, in all cases, to ascertain the extent of the Injunctive operation.
taducyate	consequently it could not take up all things, simply because we wish it so.
yadyasmadabhiprāyānurodhenābhidhāna viniyoga śrutivaśena vā liṅādayo viddhyuḥ tataḥ sarvaṃ vidhīyeta / te tu svaśaktimanurudhyamānā kiṃ cideva vidadhati na sarvam /	That is to say, if the Injunctive operated always in accordance with our wishes, or with that which is expressed or mentioned as useful, by the words, then we could have the Injunction of all that is spoken of in the sentence as a matter of fact, however, the operation of the Injunctive is always limited by its own potency and as this potency is limited in its scope, we have the Injunction of only a few, and not all, of all that is expressed by the sentence. Then again, the Injunctive potency is Direct or Implied, according as it is based upon the Bhavana or upon the Agencies Kārakas and apart from these two, there is no Injunctive potency, either Direct or Implied.
tathā hi śrutāvatprayojanabhāvanā vidhīyate / tadanyathānupapattesvarthātkāra kāntarāṇi	For instance, the Bhavana is enjoined directly by means of the injunctive affix and it is for the sake of the accomplishment of this Bhäranā, that other agencies are enjoined indirectly.
tena saṃmārgādyanuṣṭhāne kiṃ grahaikatvādyapi kartavya muta neti jāyate saṃdehaḥ	Thus then, with regard to the performance of the Washing of the vessels as laid down by the sentence graham sammärshti, it is only natural that there should arise the question as to whether the Singleness of the vessel is also to be brought about or not.
atha dravyaviśeṣaṇaṃ tato na vivaścitamiti	And if this singleness, being an agency, he a qualification of the Bhavan, then, being taken up by the In junction, it could not but he accepted as Intended significant while if it be a more qualification of the Substance, then it could not be taken as fa tended.
atha vā	II. There is another explanation also of the propriety of the use of the words Intention and Nonintention.
śabdaśaktyanusāreṇa vākyārthaṃ gamayanti te /	They always interpret a sentence, in accordance with the potencies of words and hence they seek to explain those things that are found amenable to these potencies while those that are abandoned by these potencies, are not taken up for explanation.
tatra yaḥ śaktyupārūḍhaḥ sa tairvyākhyātumiṣyate /	Consequently by Viva kshita is meant that which is intended or wished by the Mimānsakas to be explained and that which, being untouched by the said potency, is not so intended, is spoken of as Arivakshita and this intention and noninten tion pertains to those Teachers of the Veda who have gone before.
yastu bhaktyā parityakto na vyācikhyāsyate sa taiḥ /	Conse quently, inasmuch as the mention of Intention and Nonintention is with reference to the Teachers, there is nothing objectionable in the words being introduced in connection with the Veda.
tasmāyākhyāṭagatameva vivaścitāvivaścitatvamupanyasya viśvā rakaraṇādvedepyavirodhaḥ	Or again, the Intention and Nonintention spoken of might refer to the Intelligences ensouling the various Vedic collections, Rgveda and the rest the Body in this case being one made up of words.
mahābhautikaṭe isthā yathātmānaḥ sacetanāḥ / kaṃ cidarthaṃ vivaśvanti na vivayanti cāparam	Just as in the material bodies we have intelligent souls, who intend certain things, and do not intend others, and this intention, though existing only in the inner soul, is yet known, exactly as if it appeared in the external world, by people pondering over the sentence, by means of the potency of the words composing the sentence uttered by them so in the same manner could we become cognisant of the Intention or otherwise of the Intelli gence ensouling the Veda.
dehabhedaprakārāśca karmaśaktivaśānugāḥ / prakṛtyārambhavaicivyād dṛśyante paramātmanām	Then as for the possibility of such a Body as that attributed to the Vedas, we find that there are various kinds of Bodies, brought about by the peculiar actions of the souls inhabiting them,all these diverse kinds depending upon the modifications of Primordial Matter.
śrūyante vāruṇe loke dehāḥ svacchāṅgalakṣaṇāḥ kharceke taijasaprāyā dehāḥ śuddhaprabhānvitāḥ / āpyāyante vikorṇena bhānavīyena tejamā tathā vyomaśarīropi paramātmā śrutau śrutaḥ / ijyate vāriṇā nityaṃ yaḥ khaṃ brahmeti coditaḥ	For in stance In this world of ours we find four kinds of Bodies, made up mostly of the earthelement, aided by those of water and the rest,these bodies being the Wombborn, the Wygborn, the Groundborn, and the Sweat born bodies built up of water with the help of the other elements, clean and transparent, are known to exist in the regions of Varuņa there are many beings who wander about in the sky, with their subtile bodies made up of Air mixed with Earth and the rest in the Heavenly Regions, there are bodies of Light, effulgent and glorious, which become added to byandby by the rays emitted from the sun as has been declared in the Veda also, at the close of the sentences dealing with the Nakshatrëshţi ‘yê hi janāḥ punyakṛtaḥ..tëshāmetāni jyotíṁshi yannakshatrāṇi,and Manu also speaks of people proceeding to Heaven in a body of light the Veda also speaks of the soul inhabiting a body of Akaça, when it declares ijyatē vāriņā nityam yaḥ kham Brahma.
bhogyatvenātmanāṃ tepi caitanyānugatāḥ sadā	Then again, Colour, Touch and the other properties that belong to the elements, are, each of them, bodies for the experiences of the soul.
tayaiva tu parityaktaṃ vyākhyeyamavivakṣitam anādinidhanepyevaṃ veḍhe vedārthagocare / vyākhyānaṃ mukhyavṛttyāpi syādvivāvivakṣayoḥ tantravārtike /	Consequently, when we proceed to explain the meanings of the senten ces of these Vedas, which contain within themselves particular intentions, whether they are intended to be significant or not is ascertained by means of the potencies of the words and the upshot comes to be that that which is taken up by the Injunctive potency is what is intended while that which is abandoned by it, is to be explained as not intended to be signifi cant.
sarvatra vidhipratiṣedhātmakatvāhedasya yāvatkaṃ cicchūyate ta tsarvaṃ tatsaṃbandhitvena gamyate	In this manner, it is quite possible to attribute, on the strength of the potency of the Injunctive, the said Intention and Nonintention to the soul of the CabdaBrahma, which pervades all the Vedas and there is nothing incongruous in speaking of Intention and Nonintention, even in the direct sense of these words, with reference to the Veda, which is beginningless and endless.
tatra yadi grahaḥ svarūpamātreṇa bhāvanāyāmanupraviśetata ekatvaṃ paścāgaviṣyadagṛhītaṃ bhāvanayā bhāvanāgataṃ na syāt / grahasvarūpasyaitra syādatosāvekatvapuraḥsarameva tatsamānadeśaṃ vā pṛthakpadopāttāruṇādivadevātmānaṃ pratipadyate	Thns then, the question comes to be whether the Veda really intended. the singleness of the vessel, or not and in course of the present Adhika rana, our Author will come to a definite conclusion, by a course of well connected reasoning. That action which is mentioned as connected with singleness, and that Injunction of the substance which is also mentioned along with singleness, should always be performed and understood respectively as pertaining to one thing only. is In all cases, the Veda consisting of Injunctions and Prohibitions, whatever we come across in the course of the Veda should always be taken as connected with an Injunction or a Prohibition and we should always try our very best to construc every such thing in such a manner as to make it connected with an Injunction or a Prohibition.
viśiṣṭo hi vidhiḥ kvatsno nāpraklṛptaviśeṣaṇaḥ /	. it and it is only when the accessories are not related to one another that the Injunction of any one of thom does not involve that of another, as we have shown above.
viśiṣṭo vibhinaṣṭīti tatpūrva praviśatyasau	Because as the two treat of two wholly distinct subjects, there can be no contradiction of the one by the other.
evaṃ ca sati bhāvanāpraviṣṭaṃ tadvidhināpi saṃspṛśyamānaṃ dravyaguṇayorniyame sati grahasya jātaṃ bhavati /	Thus then, in the case in question, the Bhāvanā, taking up the distinctly mentioned vessel as qualified by singleness, does not take up the qualified Vessel without taking up, along with it, the qualifying singleness also. And when the singleness would thus enter into the Bhavanā, it would be taken up by the Injunction also and then there being a mutual restriction between the Substance and the Property, it comes to belong to the Vessel.
atha vā śrutibalīyavādasya dravyasaṃbandha uccate	Or again, the objector has based his argument upon the superior anthority of Direct Assertion, on the strength of which he has declared the singleness to be related to the Substance Vessel.
prātipadikopāttaṃ hi dravyaṃ samānapadopāttatvena pratyāsannaṃ syāt	Becanse the Substance Vessel, mentioned by the basic noun ‘graha, would be the nearest to the singleness mentioned by a part of the same “word but we find that this singleness is very much more nearly related to the particular Agency that is signified by the same caseending the Accusative as itself, and as such it is much sooner recognized as qualify ing this Agency.
kārakaṃ ca vibhaktipratipāditamā virbhūtapūrvāparībhūtabhāvanaikadeśa ityaktam	And we have already shown that the Agency, expressed by the caseending, is a constituent part of the Bhāvanā, which is made up of various factors, appearing one after the other.
tasmādupādīyamānapaśvādivadevoddiśyamānasyāpi saṃkhyā vivacitā puṃpaśuśceti prasaṅgādudāhṛtam	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the number of the uddleçya also is to be taken as intended to be significant, just like that of the enjoined vidheya.
sarveṣāṃ vā lakṣaṇatvādaviśiṣṭaṃ hi lakṣaṇam	Sūtra All Individuals are indicated, because the generic character belongs equally to all.
vyaktīruddiśya yatkarma svajātyādyupanaścitāḥ / vihitaṃ guṇabhāvena tatsarvārthaṃ pratīyate	It is a wellestablished fact that whenever an action is laid down, in a subordinate form, with reference to a number of individuals, all of which are indicated by the generic Class, etc., that Action pertains to every one of them.
tatrāpi grahatvasya saṃmārgānaītvāktayaḥ saṃskāryatvenāvatiṣṭhante	For instance, in the case in question, we at once recognize the ressel to be the principal factor,because it is spoken of in the Accusative case vide Sūtra IIi, and also because it is the useful factor, and the wash ing to be the subordinate factor.
yad grahakāyeṃ tatsaṃmārgeṇa saguṇāṃ bhavati nahi tadānīṃ grahāntareṣvagṛhyamāṇeṣu kasya tṛtīyādhyāpasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Then, inasmuch as the class vessel which is denoted by the word graha is, by itself, incapable of being washed, it is the individual vessels that are indicated as the objects to be purified by the washing but since the individual vessels are not capable of being denoted by the word gruha, we accept the class vessel as in dicative of them. Consequently, the meaning of the Injunctive sentence. in question comes to be that the action to be performed with the vessels would be perfect only by the previous washing of the vessels and if any vessel should bo left unwashed, the action performed with it would remain imperfect hence it is necessary that all the vessels should be washed.
cidvaiguṇyaṃ dṛśyate	as the requirements of the Injunction will have been fulfilled by the wash ing of a single vessel.
athāpi śāstratantratvātmārgaḥ pratigraham /	i For these reasons, we must conclude that the word graham indi cates all the vessels because all of them are equally related to the generic class vessel, and because all are equally connected with the context.
tathāpyakaraṇe tasya jñānaṃ bādhyeta tadgatam	Not perceiving any ground for taking the Singular number in graham to be nonsignificant, the objector in the Bhashya comes forward with the argument that we find the Singular number actually mentioned.
tasmād grahatvāpūrvasaṃyogāviśeṣātprakaraṇāviśeṣāśca sarvapratyayaḥ tatrottaram	The reply to this is that all that may happen to be mentioned is not necessarily something to be performed or brought into action be cause in the matter of actual performance, it is necessary to find out an Injunction, or the, Mention of Uses,either directly mentioned or indirect ly implied.
vihito viniyuktaśca gṛhyate caśrutoṣi san/ śrutopi tu na gṛhyeta yorthastābhyāmupekṣitaḥ	Because that which is enjoined, or has its uses mentioned, is accepted as to be brought into action, even if it be not actually ex pressed in so many words while even if something is actually so ex pressed, if it happens to be abandoned by them i.c., by the Injunction and the Mention of Uses, it is not taken up for performance.
vacanavyaktibhedana sarveṣāmeva darśanāt / vihito viniyuktaca kaḥ, ko neti vicāryate	Specially as by manipulating the construction of the sentence in different ways, every one of the things may be made to appear as en joined or mentioned as useful,it becomes necessary to find which are actually enjoined and which not.
vartamānasarūpeṇa ciṅarthasmṛtisādhunā / pañcamena lakāreṇa kiṃ nāmātra vidhīyate	As a matter of fact, the expounders of Mimāmsā, when discussing the meanings of sentences, very often throw dust into peoples eyes, by a skilful manipulation of the syntactical construction. Thus then, in the case in question, what we have to consider is what is actually enjoined by the word Summarshṭi, which has the form of the Present Tense, but really is in the Let form, which is laid down as having the sense of the Injunctive.
sākiṃ dhātvarthamātreṇa saṃmārgeṇa viśeṣyate / lokaprasiddharūpeṇa śakyānuṣṭheyatātmanā	Then there arises the question as to whether the Bharanã that is enjoined is qualified by the denotation of the Verbal Root, the washing, only, which is well known in the world as something to be performed,or by the substance Vessel,or by the singleness of the vessel.
tulyārthatvātma bhedena nānyaiḥ saha vicāryate /	As for the word Daçāpavitrēņa, it is equally significant in all cases and serving the same purpose in all cases, it is not necessary to consider its various significations, as is done with the other words.
grādīnāṃ ca kiṃ ceha niyogena nirūpaṇā saṃmārgagrayoḥ kiṃvā vikalpotha samuccayaḥ /	With reference to the word graham and the rest, however, it becomes necessary to consider what is actually enjoined.
saṃbandhaḥ samudāyo vā vibhinaṣṭīca bhāvanām tathā kṛtvā dvayoḥ pūrvaṃ viśeṣaṇaviśeṣyatām /	And in this connec tion, we are faced by the following alternatives Firstly as regards the washing and the Vessel, do these qualify the Bhāvanā, alterna tively or conjointly ? or is it their relationship or their aggregation that qualifies it? or is it that one of these two while qualifying the other, qualifies the Bhavana also, and through that, comes to be enjoined? Secondly, as regards the washing and the Singleness, also we have the same eightfold questions to consider.
tṛtīyena sakena tādṛśyeva vicāraṇā tathā tatra kriyāpradhānatve sāhityaṃ dravyasaṃkhyayoḥ /	Thirdly, as regards the “graha tva and the Ekatva also, we have the same questions. That is to say among the threethe washing, the Vessel and the Singleness, we can take any two of which one would qualify the other, and then proceed to consider the question of the relation of these with the third. Along with these questions, there arises the further question, as to whether these the Vessel, the Singleness and the Bhāvarā form the Object of Injunction ie.
ekatvasyaiva kiṃ, kiṃ vā vikalpena iyorapi	Predicate or of mere Assertion i.e. the Subject, with reference to the washing and that too whether singly or conjointly.
yena yena prakāreṇa saṃkhyopādīyate grahe / saṃmārge vā vidhīyeta sa tamāpādayiṣyati	When the Action is the principal factor, then, there is a conjunction of the Substance and the Number and hence all the requirements are ful filled by a single performance of that Action. When, on the other hand, the Action is laid down as with reference to the Vessel and Singleness and thereby becomes the subordinate factor, then, in that case, the Action and the Injunctive sentence, are taken as complete in each of the Vessels.
yāṃ yāṃsa vacanavyakti vidheye ravayiṣyati / vākyabhedana māṃ tāṃ tu siddhāntī dūṣayaṣyati	On the other hand, all the syntactical constructions that he would attribute to the sentence, with a view to make the singleness an object of Injunction, will be rejected by the Siddhanti as involving a syntactical split. As a matter of fact, also, the Vessel can never be the predicate of the sentence in question and it becomes all the more impossible for the singleness to be so because it is subservient to the Vessel.
tanmācaoṇaśaktitvāṭekatvaṃ na vidhāsyate / na tāvattadgrahe śakyaṃ vidhāmapunaḥśruteḥ /	Thus then, the sentence being taken as enjoining the washing for the Vessel, its Injunctive potency is wholly spent upon that, and as such, it could not enjoin the singleness. Nor could the sentence be taken as enjoining singleness for the Vessel, because there is no repetition of the lujunctive word and the word Graham as it would be necessary, in that case, to have two Injunctive words and two grahas.
vartanīyau hi syātāṃ grahavidhāyaka grahopyāvartanīyaḥ syātsaṃbandhadvaya siddhaye /	And in case the relationship of the Vessel and Singleness were positively enjoined,if it were found desirable to have an Injunction of something over and above the connec tion of the Vessel and the washing, then, also, it would be necessary, for the sake of the accomplishment of the two relationships of the Vessel to have a repetition of the word graham and in this case also, the Injunc tive word would have to be repeated as a single Injunctive cannot enjoin two relationships.
vidhāyakaca, naikena vidhinā to hi sidhyataḥ saṃkhyāsaṃmārgasaṃbandhau grahoṣi prāpnuvannubho /	For, if the Injunctive affix were to enjoin two relationships, either simultaneously, or one after the other, how could it do so, unless it were pronounced twice? so also if the Vessel were to attain the relationship of the Singleness and the washing, it could not do so without its being repeated twice.
punaruccāryamāṇaśca samāmnāyā iciḥ sthitaḥ / pratyayaḥ pauruṣeyatvādapramāṇaṃ prasajyate	Then again, the first utterance of the Injunctive having its potency wholly spent up in the enjoining of the washing for the Vessel, it would be absolutely necessary to utter it over again, for the enjoining of the Singleness of that Vessel. And this second utterance could not but be something wholly outside the Vedic Text and thus originating from a human speaker, it could not have any authoritative character.
kena cittu prakāreṇa vidhirasya bhavedyadi /	Thus then, however much we may rack our brains over the various constructions of the sentence in question, we cannot find any proper way whereby we could have an injunction of Singleness and as such this latter cannot be taken as something to be brought into action.
grahādivahanuṣṭhāne ka ekatvaṃ parityajet yadi kriyāpradhānatvaṃ lapsyate pūrvapakṣiṇā /	If in any way we could have an Injunction of this Singleness, it would be like the Vessel,etc. and bow could anyone neglect it, during the performance? But this would be possible, only if the Action were the principal factor. As in that case, on the strength of the fact of the Injunction being that of the qualified Vessel, we could have an indirectly implied Injune tion of the qualifying Singleness also.
tataḥ sarvavivacāpi taddāraṇāsya sevyati /	Consequently, if the opponent can establish the fact of the Action being the principal factor, then, through that, he could establish the fact of all things mentioned in the sentence being intended to be duly significant.
tasmānna śrutamātratvaṃ vidhigrahaṇakāraṇam /	For these reasons, we conclude that the more fact of something being mentioned in a sentence is not sufficient reason for taking it as enjoined.
ataḥ śaklādibhistulyaṃ naitadanyai viśeṣaṇaiḥ	and hence the qualification in question Singleness is not similar in character to such other qualifications as white and the like.
tatra dravyaviśeṣaṇaṃ tāvannirākriyate tatra svarūpaprakṣepa viśeṣaṇapha tāvatsarveṣvapi saṃsṛjyamāneṣu saṃbhavatyeva	As a matter of fact, it could be its qualification, either as forming au integral part of the Substance, or as serving to preclude, from it, all other Numbers. The former is quite compatible with the fact of the washing being performed with regard to all the Vessels for if oue washes many vessels, he certainly washes one and in that case, the washing of all the Vessels being known, by reason of the generic character of the Vessel belonging to all of them, as to be performed,and not being found to be prohibited by i.e.
ataśca grahatvasaṃvandhena prāpta ekavacanena cāpratiṣiddhaḥ kimiva dvitīyādeḥ saṃmārgo na kriyate	incompatible with the singular number in graham, what reason can one have for leaving off the washing of the second and the following Vessels? The following argument might here be brought forward by the oppo nent The basic noun gruha itself being sufficient to denote the fact of one and all of the vessels being washed, the affixed singular ending could not be taken as a subsidiary Arthavada and as such it would be taken as serving the purposes of preclusion of the weshing of more than one Vessel.
prātipadikādevaikasminnane kasmiṃśca grahe saṃmārjanīye prāpte punare kavacana śrutirguṇārthavādatvenāsaṃbhavanto parisaṃkhyārthā bhaviṣyatīti/	Then again, Preclusion Parisankhyā is possible only when there is a likelihood of the universal application of a certain thing being counte nanced by an assumed text, while its particular application is directly men tioned in a vedic text because in such a case the Preclusive Injnuction is free from all objections. Specially in this case, as the text supporting the universality has got to be assumed, while that supporting the particular application is already existent, the Preclusion is accepted in view of the desirable result that it is found to accomplish.
naitadevam /	That is to say, the noun can have no connection in the sentence unless there are three words e.g.
kutaḥ tacca nānāvākyatve satyeva bhavati, isa tvekenaiva vākyena prāptiḥ parisaṃkhyā ca kriyataityuktaṃ, taccātyantamevānupapannam	Nor does the Mantra stand in need of any other ground for being applicable to the Horses Reins because the generic word · raçanā in the mantra serves to point out that application just as well as any specification of it. Then again, in all cases, it is necessary to have recourse to indirect Indication, at least for the indication of the fact of the Reins, etc., leading to certain Apūrvas and hence inasmuch as the mention of the Horses Reins would be got at by the Indication of the word ‘raçanã , another direct Injunction of the same in the sentence ‘ityaçvã,etc. would be wholly useless.
yathā tathā padavyaktibhedopyatra prasajyate	As the word HorsesReins would take exactly the same time in iudicating its Injunction, as the word ‘raçanā would in indicating the Horses Reins.
nirdoṣatvaṃ hi tatrāsyā vidhāne sati labhyate /tantravārtika / kalyatvena hi tasyaiṣā klṛptādāśrīyate phacāt ityādattaimi hāsmādākhyātāhidhisaṃbhavaḥ /	For these reasons, we cannot take the clanse ityāduttē as merely referring to the application of the Mantra which is pointed out by its own words nor can we take the latter sentence to be injunctive of the Horses Reins as what the sentence does is to enjoin the Bhavana which is simultaneously qualified by all the threethe Horses Reins, the Mantra and the Holding denoted by the verbal root.
saṃbandheśvābhidhānyāṃtu nāsti kaścidvidhāyakaḥ na vārthaviprakarṣosya raśanāṃ prati kaścana /	Then again, in no way does the form of the Mantru itself point to its connection with the Holding because the Mantra does not enjoin any such connection, without bringing about the assumption of a vedic text to the effect but long before the form and the context of the Mantra bring about the assumption of the necessary vedic text, the required Injunction of the connection of the Mantra is accomplished by means of the already exist ing text ityaçvā, etc..
tasmānnādatta ityetadrū pātprāśamanūdyate /	Consequently, the latter sentence must be taken as enjoining the connection of the Mantra, which has not been laid down before.
na vetyaśvābhidhānīmityetadatra vidhīyate rūpaprakaraṇadvārā śrutirthāvattu kalpyate / tāvatpratyayā tyā vidhiḥ śīghra samāpyate	i not because of a repetition of the specification. When we proceed to seek for the special purpose served by this Injunction, we find that it does not serve any other purpose than the preclusion of the Mantra from the Asis Reins. But this preclusion of something else does not form the meaning of the sentence, like a specialization because the preclusion of the Ass is accomplished by the very fact of its not having any connection with the Mantra and it is only that which is likely to e me in that is precluded by means of a sentence.
prayojanaṃ vidheḥ kiṃ syādasyeti tu nirūpaṇe / na gardabha bhidhānītaḥ phalamanyannivartanāt na ca gardabhabandhanyāṃ prāptonanumitaśrutiḥ / mantro yena nivartyeta vājirajjupunaḥśruteḥ	Specially as we find that the Mantra can not pertain to the Reins of the Ass until it has brought about the assumption of a vedic text to that offect and hence it cannot be held that the Repetition, in the latter sentence, of the Horses Reins, is to be taken as precluding that Mantra from being applied to the Reins of the Ass because the men tion of the Horses Rins could be called a Repetition only if it had been laid down before by the quicker action of another text and the pre vions mention of the Reins of the Ass cannot make the subsequent mention of the Horses Reins a repetition.
aśvaśrutyaiva śīghratvānmantre prāvihite sati / tantravārtike / nirākājīkṛtāmnāye tathā prakaraṇinyapi	Because the application of the Mantra is found to have been previously laid down by the quicker operation of the Direct mention of the “Horso and thus the Veda, as well as the subject in question, having all its requirements fulfille , there can be no assumption of another text, on the sole anthority either of the indicative power of the words of the Mantra or of the Context. And when no such text is assumed, there is no application of the Mantra to the Reins of the Ass.
tatpaścādgardabhaḥ prāptuṃ kenopāyena śaknuyāt yadānumitayā pyeṣa śrutyāvaraśanāṃ prati / prāpnuyādeva mantraḥ kiṃ tvarayā vicitastvayā yadyaśvaraśanāprāptiṃ kevacāmānumānikī /	It is on this that we have the wellknown proverb How can the Ass overtake that which has been taken away by the Horse ? We can, however, enquire from the Direct Assertion of the Horse what special purpose it serves and on this point, we could address her in the following manner Is it by sheer force that you have obstructed the assumption of the indicated text? When the Mantra could be applied to the Horses Reins, oven by means of the assumed text, why should you have been in a hurry to enjoin it? It is quite true that no texts could be assumed for that which you enjoin but what do you gain by obstructing that assumption? And we have the following reply If the assumed text could lay down the applicability of the Mantra to the Horses Reins only, in the same manner as is done by the Diret Injunction, then alone could this litter be useless.
pratyakṣa śrutivatkuryāttataḥ sā syādanārthakā kevalāśvābhidhānyāṃ hi vidhiḥ pratyayā yathā /	As a matter of fact, however, the text assumed on the strength of the words of the Mantra would indicate the applicability of the Mantra to the Reins of the Horse, as also to that of the Ass and hence it is for the purpose of averting this dual application that the Direct Injunction hastons to mention the Horses Reins.
na syāttathānumānikyā śrutyetyāmnāyate isa/ ataścāpunaruktatvātpratyakṣārthavatī śrutiḥ /	And we have this latter Injune tion, because the assumed text could not point out the application of the Mantra to the Reins of the Horse only, as is done by the Direct Injunction. Thus then, not being a mere repetition, this Injunction comes to be recog nized as serving a useful purpose and inasmuch as all requirements are fulfilled by it, the Mantra cannot bring about the assumption of any other text.
yadā tu pratibaddhatvātmāmānya viniyogakṛt /	If the Injunction in question had only repeated the fact of the pre viously mentioned applicability of the Mantra,then, in, that case, the Preclusion would be open to all the three objections.
naiva cecchu tirastīca na prāpnoti tridoṣatā	When, however, the text being restricted, there is nothing to lay down the common applica bility of the Mantra to the Reins of the Horse, as also to that of the Ass. then the Preclusion is totally free from the three objections.
tataśca bhāṣyakāreṇa yadihoktama cintitam / vākyabhaṅgyataraṃ tatra kartavyotīva nādaraḥ /	This is what we have already explained under the Sutra Iii and it is only in the way explained there that the Preclusion can be shown to be free from all objections. For these rasons, we conclude that we should not attach any importance to the expression in question that the Author of the Bhashya has inadvertently used.
na caikatva saṃvandhamātra vidhiḥ śakyaḥ saṃmārgagrahasaṃbandhamājavi bhānopakṣīṇaśaktitvādvidhāyakasya /	Nor is it possible for the sentence in question to be an Injunction of the connection of singleness because its injunctive potency is wholly taken up by the injunction of the connection between the washing and the Vessel.
yathaudanopaghāta nivāraṇavidhipare vākye śrutānāmapi śvamārjārādīnāmaviṣoyamānatvādaviśeṣaṇatvam	Just as in the case of the sentence Protect this food from animals the dog, and the cit, which enjoins the protecting of the food, even though the particular animals dog and cat are mentioned, yet they are not accepted as in any way restricting the Injunction and the reason for this is that in this sentence the dog and the cat are not mentioned as the objects to be protected i.e.
tulyānnādyopaghātāttu kākāderepi vāraṇā /	objects of the enjoined protection from the enting of the food and consequently inas much as the protection of the food is what is enjoined, the man directed protects it from other animals alsosuch as the crow and the likewhich too are as much spoilers of the food as the dog and the cat.
tathācāha / kākebhyo racyatāmannamiti bālopi coditaḥ /	In this connection we have the following saying Even a child, when told to protect the food from crows, does not omit to protect it from the dog and other animals, because he knows that the chief factor in the direction was the protection.
upaghātapradhānatvānna vādibhyo na rakṣati	Though the above example of the protection of the food has been cited by the Bhashya, yet it does not quite fit in with the case in question. sentences.
saṃkhyāmācāvivakṣā tu grahastheti vilakṣaṇam sthitasiddhāntodāharaṇamapi paśuprakaraṇe śrūyate	This sentence would be fitly cited in connection with the next Adhikaraṇa, where it is considered if the washing is applicable to the Ladle, etc., also, just like the washing of the altar.
ma davattaṃ tatpañcasaṃkhyaṃ kāryamityetadvidhipare vākye vapāgrahaṇamānavaścitaṃ vākyabhedaprasaṅgāditi daśame vakṣyati /	X and it would have been fitting to cite, in that connection, the sentence that the Bhashya has cited here. In the case in question, on the other hand, it should have cited some such sentence of ordinary parlance, in which the Number alone is intended to be nonsignificant for instance, the sentence Vrshalaih na praveshṭavyam, where the Plural in Vrshulaih is not intended to be significant, because the sentence is taken as prohibitive of the entry of the wyshala, singly, as well as collectively in large numbers.
saṃkhyāmātravibakṣāyāṃ loke yacchūyate vacaḥ/tantravārtika /	Objection The word sammärshti might be taken as enjoining the connection of the Vessel and the Singleness. Reply This could not be as that would be contradictory to what is directly mentioned by means of the same word.
baḍatvasyā vivakṣitatvāt na hoko vi dhāyakaḥ śaknoti saṃmārgabhāvanāṃ ca vidhātuṃ grahekatvasaṃbandha ca	Specially as a single Injunctive word is not capable of laying down the Bhavanā of the washing, as well as the connection of the Vessel and the Singleness and thus there being a contradiction between these two objects of the Injunction, it is the former that is accepted as its object, on the strength of its proxi mity to the Injunctive affix being closest and hence there being no other Injunction, there can be no comprehension of Singleness, It has been argued above that in the case of a qualified Injunction, the qualification of the qualification also forms an object of Injunction.
yadi tāvad grahaḥ saṃkhyāṃ kriyāyai na prayacchati /	But that is not possible because if the Vessel itself does not present the Singleness to the Action, which is qualified by the Vessel purely by itself, then the Action cannot be said to be qualified by the qualified vessel.
na hyanyathā viśiṣṭena viśeṣitā syādityevaṃ bhāvanāpye katvaviśiṣṭaṃ grahaṃ gṛhṇatī naikatvamagṛhītvā tadiśiṣṭaṃ grahaṃ śaknoti grahītam	That is to say, if the vessel throws itself as qualified by singleness, into the Bhāvanā, then, in that case, it would be necessary to throw in the qualifying singleness beforehand as otherwise the Bhavana could not he qualified by that qualification and in this case, the Bhāranā also, taking in the Vessel as qualified by Singleness, could not take in the Vessel thus quali fied, unless it took in also the qualifying Singleness. For instance, as the word denotes a substance as qualified by a certain genus or class, it does not apply to the substance, until it has denoted the qualifying Class and hence in that case it would be absolutely necessary to accept the singleness to be a qualification of the Bhavana.

tantra viśiṣṭa vidhinā bhāvanāviśeṣaṇamātrāce paryavasāyinā nārthāntarākṣepaḥ śakyaḥ kartuṃ na hi bhāvanāṃ viśiṣatastasya tadekatvaṃ viśeṣaṇam	And in a case where a substance itself is the qualification of the Bhāvanā, as in the case in question, the Bhāvanā too is connected with the Vessel only, and not with its Number and the Number also is related to the Vessel only, and not to the Bhāvanā. And thus the qualified Injunction, having its end in the pointing out of the qualification of the Bhāvanā, does not imply anything else specially as Singleness does noi necessarily qualify the Vessel, at the time that it is actually qualifying the Bhavană because the Bhāvanā does not take up the Vessel as qualified by Singleness as it does not notice the Number, which is hidden under the form of the vessel itself.
nāpi bhāvanā viśiṣṭasya mā bhūtpunarapi bhāvanāviśeṣaṇatvameva	Nor can the Singleness be taken as qualify. ing the Vessel qualified by the Bhavana because that would be tantamount to taking it as qualifying the Bhavanā itself which we shall refute below. As a matter of fact too, the Bhavana cannot qualify the qualified Vessel.
tasmānmaulikena vidhinānākāṅakṣitatvānna dravyaviśeṣaṇāl̤epaḥ saṃbhavati	Consequently there can be no implication by the Injunction of a qualification of the substance Vessel because no such qualification is wanted by the principal Injunction in question.

Even if we admit of this split, at the time of the actual washing, no attention could be paid to the Singleness as what the Injunction lays down is the connection of the Singleness with the Vessel independently by itself specially as it is not possible for an action, that is still in the position of being enjoined, to qualify a substance related to a qualification, as we have already explained in the foregoing Adhikaruņu.
na ca dravyasaṃskārā tasaṃskāro 'nyatvād, grahasya vāyamekatvadvāreṇa vidhīyate	For these reasons, the Singleness cannot be comprehended as a qualification of the substance Vessel .
anuṣṭhāna kā lepa caya hasyātmīya eva saṃmārgaḥ pratyabhijñāyataiti naikatvanimittabuddhiḥ syāt	If it be urged that the Singleness is laid down as qualifying the Bhavana of the washing,then, we reply, that it could not be its quali fication, either as a subordinate factor in the shape of the means of accomplishing the washing, or as a predominant one in the shape of some thing to be purified by the washing.
kathamaruṇatvasya guṇatvamiti cedata āha hi guṇopyanaṅgameva syāt / nanu pradhānabhūtamanoti	Question How is it that it has not the subordinate character? Answer A quality is accepted to be subsidiary, only when it is found to qualify a subsidiary substance in the caso in question, however, the Vessel is not held to be subsidiary to the washing, which does not bring about any visible results and as such the quality, Singleness, of the Vessel, which is not a subsidiary, could not have the subordinate or subsidiary character.
na hi śeṣamāśritaḥ śeṣaḥ, kiṃ tarhi upakāriṇamānita upakarotīti sarvatra sthā payiṣyāmaḥ	It is not necessary that an Accessory should always rest upon an Accessory all that is neces sary is that it should rest upon something that helps the Action, and thereby helps in its fulfilment as we shall prove later on to be the universal rale.
yattābaduktamamūrtatvātsaṃskartuṃ na śakyataiti athāpi vyaktidvāreṇāsyāḥ saṃskāraḥ sa saṃkhyāyāmapi tulyaḥ	And as to whether a certain thing is an Accessory or not, this would be ascertained by Direct Assertion, Indirect Implica tion,etc. In reply to this, the Siddhanti declares that even though it be possible for the thing in question Singlness to be subordinate to for the sake of more than one thing i.e. to the washing, as also to the Vessel, yet, in asmuch as the Injunctive word is not capable of enjoining any such thing. that would be either very remote from the Injunction, or not a sub sidiary and as such it could not but be rejected.
atha grahaśabdasya vyaktivācitvātparihāra uccate tata ākṛtyadhikaraṇanyāyo bādhyeta /	Objection The above arguments are not enough to prove that Siugleness is not intended to be significant. Because it would be truly nonsignificant, if it were a qualification of the Substance.
na hānekadeśakānnavartijyotiṣṭomaprayogasthagraha vyakti saṃbandhānubhavorita	But it has not been shown that it cannot be related to the mushing, either in the subordinate or in the principal position.

But that would be the case with the denotation of the basic noun graha also, which is the class grahatva. and which, as a class, is incorporeal, and as such incapable of being purified. If it be held that there could be a purification of the Class, through the constituant Individual, then, that could be said of the Number ‘one alsa If the purification done to the Individual be held to have been done to the Class, then the same would be the case with Singleness also as Singleness serves to indicate the Individual just as well as the Class does.
tasmāttadeva vācyam /	Consequently it is the Class that must be taken as denoted by the word.
yattu grahasya kriyamāṇaḥ saṃmārgastadīyatvāvadhāraṇenainṛtīyādhyāpasya prathamaḥ pāda /	It has been argued above that if the washing were done to the Vessel, it would be cognized as belonging to it and as such it could never be known as pertaining to Singleness and consequently there would not be much use in the repetition of the Injunction.
ekatvenāpi saṃvadhya tāvatyeva kriyā yadi / tato niṣphalatodhyeta bhedastvastye ka saṃskṛteḥ	To this argument, we offer the following reply Even when con nected with Singleness, if the Action were of the same extent as when not connected with it, then alone could it be rejected as useless as a matter of fact, however, we find that the connection of Singleness makes a great difference in the Action such difference lying in the fact that the Action of washing is done to one Vessel only otherwise if it were not connected with Singleness every one of the Vessels would have had to be washed.
tasmād dravyaguṇayorniyama siddhera tya ruṇā śabda sṭye vai katva saṃvandhasya pṛthaka prayojanamiti saṃskāryaṃ tvopapattiḥ	Thus then, there being a mutual restriction between the Substance Vessel and the Property Singleness, there is a distinct useful purpose served by the connection of Singleness, just as by the word aruna in the previous Adhikarana and as such it is quite possible for this Singleness to be an object of purification.
mandayuktika evāyamabhyupagamaḥ yadguṇamevā śra tena guṇenopakartavyamiti	the fact of its being an Accessory, it has been spoken of by the author of the Bhashya himself, to be like the Property of the Praņītā.
sākṣādayogya saṃbandhāḥ kriyāsaṃbandhini sthitāḥ / asaṃbadvairasaṃvadvāḥ sādhayanti guṇāḥ kriyām	Nor is there much reason for holding that it is only when the Accessory rests upon an Accessory that it helps the Action, because, as a matter of fact, the Accessories help to accomplish the Action, even if they are incapable of being directly related with it, when they rest in something that is related to the Action, and are not connected with any thing that has no connection with that Action. Inasmuch as the Accessories performed in that which is wholly unconnected with the Action would not pertain to or qualify that Action they always rest upon something that is connected with it.
na tu tadgataguṇapradhānatvayoḥ kaścidviśeṣa iti tayorupekṣā	Then, inasmuch as it does not make any difference whether they have the character of the Primary or the Subsidiary, no attention is paid to these characters.
etāvacca saṃbandhe kāraṇam	Just as the means of accomplishing the Action stands in need of the mention of its number, so also does it stand in need of the knowledge of the number of the Primary action that would be helped by it and it is on this fact alone that the relationship of the two is based.
yā guṇasyopakurvāṇamātmasātkurute guṇam / grahīṣyatitarāmeṣā taṃ tu saṃskāryavartinam	Then again, when the Action takes to itself that Property which helps its own Accessory, it would certainly take it up when it is found to exist in that which is purified by that Action.
yathā pradhānagataḥ ko nu khannu mama pradhānasyopakurvantyāḥ kiṃ ciḍhanugrahaṃ kuryāditi /	As a rule, it is the Primary factor that is holped even by the Property of the Action and the Property does not become subsidiary to the Action so well, when it rests in the Accessory, as it does when resting in the Primary.
mahāścāyamanugraho yatpradhāneyattāvadhāraṇaṃ nāma	It is always in need of something that would help it in bringing about the Primary action and it is a great help to it to have the extent of the Primary action of washing limited to one Vessel only.
tatrāpi hi dravyadevatāyāgaviśiṣṭabhāvanāvidhipara vākye yadi liṅgasaṃkhyāsaṃbandhoparaḥ kriyāyāṃ dravye vā vidhīyate tato vākyaṃ bhidyeteti śakyaṃ vaditum	Then as for the purificatory rites pertaining to the sacrificer, we shall show in Adh. VI that they also are subsidiary to the sacrifice, even when existing apart from their nominative character, which actually forms part “of the sacrifice, they fall into his character of the enjoyer of its results, by making him capable of enjoying those results.
api cāsminneva vākye grahamuddiśya saṃmārge vidhīyamāne pi daśāpavitrata dekatvādīnāṃ vivābhyupagamyate na ca vākyadaḥ, tathā grahaikatvepi bhaviṣyati /	And as the same rule would apply to the case in question, there can be no incongruity in the fact of the character of the Accessory belonging to those resting in the Primary Action. Such being the case, the fact of the Injunctive word being incapable of enjoining the number, that has been urged by you, would apply equally to the number of those that are predicated,such, for instance, as in the word paguna in the sentenco paçunā Rudram yjetu .
padāntaragato yasya guṇobhīṣṭo vivaścitaḥ /	.
a thāsau yāge'prāpto vidhīyate tad grahasyāpyaviśiṣṭam śakyaṃ hi yo graha itivadyaḥ parityapi vaktum	there would be a split of the sentence. If the split be avoided by tak ing the original Injunction to be a qualified one,then, that could be done in the case of washing also. And the only difference in the two cases is that in the case in ques tion the Vessel is the uddeçya that with reference to which something is predicated, while the Paçu is an upādēya that which is predi cated.
tasmādviśiṣṭa saṃbhārgaviṣyāopād grahatvavade katvasyāpi vidhisaṃsparśe satyarthād guṇapradhānabhāva ityekatvaṃ niṣprayojanatvād guṇabhūtaṃ grahaśca prayojanakattvātpradhānabhūtaḥ	But this alone does not prove anything for if the mere fact of there being a difference between the two were sufficient cause for accepting the number in one as significant, and rejecting that in the other as nonsignificant,then the mere fact of the number being in the one related to the Vessel and in the other to the ‘Paçu, would be sufficient for establishing their nonsignificance and significance.
padabhedona ca nyāyyaḥ prakṛtipratyayau prati	And further, in the very sentence in question, though it is the washing that is enjoined or predicated with reference to the Vessel.
dhūmādiṣvaniprasaṅgāde kasminnapi cākhyātā ḍhipratyayenai korthaḥ pratīyataiti pratyarthaṃ padatvaprasaṅgaḥ / padamiti ca laukikaḥ śabdaḥ sa yatra lokena prayujyate yatra ca smaṭebhiḥ smaryate na tato 'panetuṃ śakyate /	yet due significance is attached to the washing Cloth and its singleness, without incurring a syntactical split and it could be the same in the case of the Singleness of the Vessel also. If you were to declare that the two cases are not quite similar, because the cloth, etc., are mentioned in a different word from the washing, while the Singleness is mentioned by the same word as the Vessel,.then, for you, there could be no citing of examples of Singularity as there would always be some sort of a difference between any two cases specially as there are no two cases that are precisely amenable to the same laws and conditions.
tatraiva ca padaśabdaḥ prayujyate vārtika / vibhaktyu pāttakamaṃtvavivakṣā cediheṣyate /	Then again, when one accepts, as significant, the property that is montioned by another word,then, how could he reject, as nonsignificant, that which is mentioned by the same word? s For these reasons, the Singleness of the Vessel must be regarded as significant.
tadica yadi tāvatsaṃkhyāparityāgādvibhaktiḥ parityaktā tataḥ karmatvaparityāgopi prāpnoti prayojanavattvāt saṃskāryatvamiti cet na, kārakavibhaktimantareṇa kriyāsaṃbandhābhāvāt /	As a matter of fact too, we find that even that with reference to which something is predicated is touched by Injunctions. For, if it were not so, then, in the case in question, the Injunction would have been duly carried out, even if the washing were performed apart from the Vessel. It might bo argued that the sentence could not be taken as enjoin ing the Vessel, because it has already been laid down elsewhere.
na hyavibhaktikasya gra ha ityetāvataḥ saṃmātyanena saṃbandhovakalpate	But that would not be correct as the Vessel has never before been laid down in connection with washing. Then, it might be urged that it could not be enjoined, because of its having been already laid down in connec tion with the Jyotishloma.
na kasya cihnavedeṣa grahakarmāvivacayā	But in that case, there could not be an Injunction of the Animal, etc., because these are already found in the ordinary world.
grahaṇāgrahaṇaṃ yuktamakukkuṭipākavat atra pratividhīyate	connection with the sacrifice.the same might be said of the Vessel also which has not been laid down in connection with washing.
tatra yadi tāvad grahagatamevaikatvaṃ saṃskriyate tataḥ sāpekṣakaraṇādubhayornirapekṣasaṃbandhāvadhṛtaṃ prādhānyaṃ vihanyeta / atha dravyāntaragataṃ, tat na jāyeta kimiti / na grahavatkiṃ cidekaṃ nāma prakaraṇe paśyāmaḥ	Then, it might be urged that inasmuch as the washing is not outside the pale of the Jyotishțome, the fact of the lessel having been laid down in connection with this latter would make it incapable of being enjoined by the sentence in question. But thon, inasmuch as the Animal sacrifice is not outside the limits of the world, the fact of the Animal being found in the world would make it incapable of being enjoined! Then again, as for the argument that the Fessel cannot be enjoined, because it is that with reference to which something else the washing is laid down, it is wholly unsound becanse Reference Anurāda and Tajunction Vidhi are respectively totally different from that with reference to which something is predicated ddeya and that which is predicated upadoyur. Because we find that that which is the Fadegy that with reference to which something is laid downe.g.
na teṣāmapi bahatvātkimiti nirūpaṇāśaktaḥ /	space, time, &c.is “often found to be enjoined while that which is the Upīdēga that which is predicatede.g.
atha sarveṣāṃ kamānna bhavati na, tatrāpi coditānyacoditakaraṇāpatteḥ	the killingis not enjoined in the sentence · ‘parunā, &c., because it has been laid down elsewhere.
naitadasti pratyekaṃ gṛhyamāṇānāṃ tahadeva saṃskā re sati yogapadyaprasaṅgābhāvā, dabhyupetyavādamātraṃ caitatsvatantrai katvāpratīteḥ	Thus then, inasmuch as the sentence in question implies the Injunction of the qualified washing, the Singleness is as much touched by the Injunction as the Fessel itself and as for the fact of the former being the subordinate and the latter the predominaut factor, that is due to the fact of the latter serving a useful purpose, which is not done by the former.
śraya tu guṇabhūtamekatvaṃ vidhoyeta tatra dvitīyā tāvad gu pābhāvaṃ naiva bravītīti vyākhyātaṃ sakkadhikaraṇe /	Then again, it is scarcely proper that there should be simultaneous Injunction and Noninjunction by the same word nor would it be correct to take the basic noun ‘graha and the Accusative Affix as two distinct words.
athāsya kathaṃ cidasaṃbhavaṃ kalpayitvā jakṣaṇāśrīyate tataḥ punaḥ saṃbhavakalpanā virodhātmatyapi prayojanavave śākhavaśena guṇatvaprasaṅgaḥ / yugapasaṃbhavāsaṃbhavaparigra dātprādhānya guṇatvayoḥ prādhānyānocanena vilepāca śabdakteśaḥ	That is to say, when the single word graham is pronounced, it would be highly improper to take it as enjoining the Tessel denoted ¨ by the basic noun, and not the Singleness expressed by the Affix. Nor can the affix be taken as a distinct word because it is never used independently by itself, and it always appears at the end of words, and not indiscriminately, sometimes before and sometimes after them as is the case with words for instance, we have ghatam ānaya as well as anaya ghatam when both anaya and ghatam are two distinct words.
na hyartho nāma kiṃ citpramāṇaṃ, kiṃ tarhi śabdaśakti kalpanā hetuḥ /	Nor can it be urged that the Aflix is a word, because it expresses, or brings about the cognition of, a certain meaning. Because in that case the smoke would also be a word, inasmuch as it denotes the existence of fire.
ataścāneka kalpanānimitto hyastyeva vākya bhedaḥ vidhīyamānamapyarthamanyato vāvadhāritam /	And then, inasmuch as a single verbal aflix is found to denote more than one meaning, we would have to take the same affix as a distinct word, with each meauing denoted. And again, the word word i is one that is in common use in the world and as such it cannot be precluded from that sense in which it is used, and which is pointed out by the grammatical rules relating to it.
avaśyaṃ bhāvinaṃ prāpya na śabdonyatra vartate śrutyā cāvaśyaṃ bhāvini grahaprādhānyavidhāne labhyamāne ko jātu cidarthātleśena kalpayiṣyati	And further, in all cases of nonsiguificance, the word is taken to be as good as not uttered i.e., not present in the sentence and conse quently until the uttered present word has been assumed to be not uttered absent.who can set aside its denotation from the meaning of the sentence in which it occars? Then again, if you would reject the signification of the number, you would have to set aside the Accusative Affix denoting it and when this allix would be set aside, the objective character would also disappear with it as there would be nothing to “denote it and hence the Vessel would cease to be cognised as some thing to be purified by the washing.
tasmācchabdasāmarthyā dubhayatra prādhānyaṃ grahītavyam bhāṣyamapyeteṣveva vākyabhedeṣu yojitavyam	That is to say, the mere basic noun graha, without the Aflix, could not be taken as bearing any relationship to the verb Sammärshti. Consequently it is absolutely necessary to accept the objective character to be duly significant and thus due significance being attached to the Affix for the sake of this objective character, inasmuch as there would be nothing to justify the rejection of another part of it which pertains to the singular number, this number too could not but be regarded as significant and as such there could not be a washing of all the vessels.
yadya pyeṣā ṣaṣṭhī viśe ṣaṇatvād guṇabhūtamivāgniṃ pratipādayati tathāpi saṃbandhāntarābhāvādaṅgāṅgisaṃbandha eva jñāyate /	If the washing were laid down both for the Vessel, and also for the Singleness, then, inasmuch as there would be no relationship between these latterbecause they would both be uddēgyas that with reference to which the washing is laid down and as such both being predominant factors, they could not pertain to the same Bhärani, see Satrü i, the Injunction would be taken as separately complete with each of these two and that would entail a syntactical split.
tṛṇānītyetadapi bahuvacanamavivakṣitamiti vyākhye yam tathā bhinne juhotītyādiṣu /	On the other hand, when we have many things predicated with reference to a single thing, the Action in question is cognised as one only, having its end in a single Bhacana qualified by all the various qualifications and hence the syntactical connection remains wholly intact.
yadi tāvabhinnaika tvayorniyo gavikalpasamuccayādibhirnimittatvaṃ saptamyocyeta tataḥ pratyekaṃ vākyaparisamāpteḥ parasparasaṃbandhābhāvaḥ / athaikatvamupādeyatvena pratipādyeta bhinnamanupādeyatvena tato yadyapi guṇatvapradhānatvavirodho nāsti tathāpi pūrvavadeva virodhaḥ /	Thus then, if it were the Singleness inhering in the Vessel that were purified, then, in that case, it would be dependent upon this latter and that would do away with the predominant character of both, as previously recognised, on the sole ground of their being independent of one another, If, on the other hand, the Singleness purified were one inhering in another substance, then it would not be known what that substance is. Because in the Context we do not find any other Single substance mentioned, in the way that the Fessel is mentioned and even that which is one may be matity, in reference to something else and there is no cause for its being specitically defined and as such it could not be recognised as oue, indepen dently of everything else.
ekavākyatve nātṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Objection That would be recognised as one which is spoken of, in the originative Injunction, by a word in the singular number.
nanu bahuṣu vivaściśeṣa bahuvacanamitya vivacitopya vidyamānortho na śakyo vaktumiti manyate /	If, on the other hand, this latter were also washed, then the aggregation of many Singles would bring about a different number and that would mean the abandoning of the directly mentioned singleness and hence the washing of many would involve a rejection of the enjoined, and the acceptance of that which is not enjoined and lastly, it would be necessary to construe the verb Sammärshti many times over, as per taining to every one of the single things.
tatra vedasya nityatvādyathocaritārthānveṣaṇamātre puruṣāṇāṃ vyāpāra iti na karteva paryanuyujyate /	For instance, if the washing be performed to the one or the other Vessel, that does not bring in any other Class save the Vessel, as it does in the case of number where a distinct number is brought up and hence in such cases, there would be nothing incongruous in the repetition of the same action with reference to each of the individuals of the same Class.
tena prātipadikārthānugrahārthā vibhaktiriti draṣṭavyam	This reply we have given, by taking for granted what the oppo nent says.
api ca grahaḥ prātipadikārtha iti yadānviṣyamāṇamapi kriyā saṃbandhitvaṃ na ghaṭate tadā tulyāyāmavivaśāyāṃ varaṃ dravyaviśeṣaṇameve damityabhiprāyaḥ /	As a matter of fact, there is no idea of the Singleness independently by itself without the substratum in which it inheres and hence the sentence in question giving no idea of any relationship of the fact, or of mere Singleness, the Injunction is distinctly recognizedas pertaining to the Vessel only and hence even though the Singleness might be intended to be significant with reference to other substances, yet with reference to the Vessel, it cannot but be regarded as nonsigni ficant. And hence it is established that all the Vessels are to be washed.
tataśca saṃmārgastena vināpya vigupo jātisaṃkhyā caiṣā pratyekaṃ saṃmṛjyamānavyaktigatā vā samathaṃnīyā	Thus then, we must bear in mind the general rule, applicable in all analogous cases,that.
saṃskārādvā guṇānāmavyavasthā sthā t	a Purificatory Rite is never enjoined with reference to the Number.
ekatvavadeva grahatvasyāpi pradarśanārthatvācca sameṣvapi saṃmārga ityupanyasya pradarśanārthatve pramāṇābhāvādvākyena ca saṃbandhopādānāt gracādavacchidya śrutvā kevala saṃmārgavidhāna tpūrvapakṣaḥ parigṛhītaḥ iha tvavaghātādivadeva bhaṅgodvārā kartavyo	Further, if the Singleness be held to be enjoined as a subordinate factor, then that would be in direct contradiction to the rule, arrived at under the Saktvadhikāraṇa IIi, that the Accusative never denotes the subordinate factor. And if the Accusative were taken as not signify ing the objective, and as indicating mere agency, then in the first place, that would mean the abandoning of its original signification and secondly, the Vessel too would have to be taken as the subordinate factor because that also is mentioned by the word with the Accusative ending. If then the Vessel be taken as the primary, and the Singleness as the subor linate factor,then, that would involve a syntactical split inas much as the single word graham, uttered but once, would have to be taken as serving the diverse functions of directly denoting the primary factor, and at the same time indirectly indicating the subordinate factor. Objection For the sake of the uniformity of the Accusative, the Vessel also, like the Singleness, might be taken as the subordinate factor but the fact of its serving a useful purpose will impart to the Vessel the predominant character and this implied predominance would not disturb the uniformity of the word i.e.
satyaṃ nāramyeta yadi grahādhikaraṇenā vivadyā kānuṣyabuddhirnayādevaṃ tvekatva vivaśvāsaṃtrāsitaḥ sarvamevāvivakṣitaṃ manyate /	To this we make the following reply When the subordinate character signified? And why should the predominance actually inhering in it be held to be implied indirectly? That is to say, as a rule, in all cases of the functioning of words, a remoter functioning is admitted only when the more proximate is found to be incompatible, and not merely by our wish.
athavāgneyādyapūrvāṇa karmabhedādbhede sati yuktāvaghātāḍhīnāṃ vyavasthā /	Hence, in the case in question, if we once, on the strength of the direct mention of the Accusa tive, admit the predominance of the Vessel, then that would be its only character.
jyotiṣṭoma karmāstvekatvā de kā pūrva sādhanayorgrahacamasayoīrmasaṃkara ityabhiprāyaḥ tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	For instance, first of all, the predominance of the Vessel is cognized through the direct expressiveness of the Accusative then that is abandoned and in the middle, we take it to be the subordinate factor and then, finding this latter to be incom patible, we again, in the end, conclude it to be the predominant factor and certainly all this means a lot of disorder and irregularity.
vyavasthā vārthasya śrutisaṃyogāttasya śabdapramāṇāt	For even though the predominance would appear subsequently, yet it would have to be based upon the word itself as the mere signification of a word is not a means of right knowledge by itself all that it does is to afford a ground for assuming a potency in the word.

That is to say, even though the predominance of the Vessel is established by the fact of its serving a useful purpose,yet, when the Accusative comes to express or bring about that predominance, even if it gets at a mere reference to it, it does not indicate anything else. For instance, in the sentence ‘dadh · nēndriyakāmasya juhuyat, what the verbal root in juhuyat refers to is only the Homa,even though this is already pointed out by the Context, and it does not, for the sake of having something to enjoin, indicate any other rootmeaning, such as Going and the like.
yadi matadaśāranirvājapeyasyeti vidhīyate yūpaśabdo yathā kathaṃ cittaḍhanuvādaḥ tataḥ ṣoḍaśipāce niveśaḥ /	Thus then, what the word graham would do would be to refer to the predominance of the Vessel, and to enjoin the subordinate character of Singleness and this would lead to another Syntactical Split. And the predominance of the C N Vessel having been positively pointed out by the Direct Denotation of the word, who would be such a fool as to assume it to be implied indirectly In certain cases, Singleness also serves the useful purpose of qualify ing a substance and hence on account of Singleness the Accusative cannot be said to renounce its sense of predominance.
athāpi yo vājapeyasya saṃbandhī ma saptadaśāraniriti vidhīyate tathāṣyevam / atha yo yūpaḥ sa saptadaśāraniriti vacanavyattiḥ vājapeyaśabdo yathā kathaṃ cidviśeṣaṇaṃ prakaraṇa prāptānuvādo vā tatastadaṅgapaśuyūpasyedaṃ paribhāṣāmiti /	The Bhashya also must be explained as pointing to the above mentioned syntactical splits consequent upon the theory of the Purva piksha. Objection What you have said might apply to the case of the sentence graham sammärshti but in the case of the sentence agnéh ` tṛṇāni, inasmuch as there is no Accusative in the word ‘agnēḥ, there would be no chance of any of the syntactical splits referred to above and as such its singleness would have to be admitted to be significant. Reply Your argument does not affect our position though the Genitive ending in the word shows the Agui to be the qualifying, and hence the subordinate, factor, yet inasmuch as there is no other relation ship possible between the Agni and Traa, the two are cognized as related to one another by the relationship of the whole and the part.

yadā tu sa nopalavdhatā paścāttaramavannambitama/	And in the case of this latter, inasmuch as all that it stands in need of is a certain relationship with that which is denoted by the basic noun, there is no want felt, of its number as the number is known by other means.

For instance, in the case of the sentence Bring in the man who is with the white dress, the cloth &c., do not form integral parts of the Bringing because that alone can be taken as the predicated, without which the performance of the action would be impossible and hence in the case in question, it is the Vessel alone that can be accepted as the predicated. Therefore the singular Accusative Affix in ‘graham must be taken as merely helping to make the use of the basic noun graha possible for denoting the particular object as the basic noun could not be used without a certain affix or it may be taken as actually expressing only the particular agency.
vakṣyati hyetat ārāḍhapoti cenna/ tadākye hi tadarthatvādityatra yathā prakaraṇavaśena tadupakārimātre dharmā vidhīyante na sājhāḍhaṅgeṣveva kevale dhviti /	Otherwise, the purodaça meant might be taken as only that which is dedicated to Ayni and in that case the expiatory rite would apply to the destruction of that one Cake only, in accordance with the law that the denotation of a word is to be restricted to that which is the most predominant as the Agneya cake is the most predominant of all the cakes concerned. And further, it is the Vessel that is signified by the basic noun. That is to say, when, as a matter of fact, however much we may look for it, the Singleness is not found to have any direct relationship with the action in question, it cannot, in any case, be regarded as significant and hence it is far more reasonable to take it as qualifying the Vessel.
tasmāna kena citpramāṇena virodha iti	And conse quently, even without the Singleness, there can be no deficiency in the Washing.

Reply Certainly it should not have been taken up, if the foregoing Adhikaraṇa had not given rise to the idea of the deficiencies of ones intention with regard to the significance of words. As it is, however, being frightened away by the foregoing Adhikaraṇa, from attaching any significance to Singleness, the Purvapakshi takes everything to be non significant.
nanvanenaiva hetu nānyatrāpyana bhiniveśa ityaruṇācodyameva/	It is this If the Washing be not related to the Vessel, then, there could be no injunction of the Washing consequently it would be absolutely necessary to have another member of the Relationship as there could be no injunction of the Washing alone, by itself.
parihāraśvākhyāte karnarguṇabhūtatvācā homasaṃbandhāḥ /	Or the Washing might be restricted to the Vessel, because of the particular Apūrva that is indicated by the latter. Objection But both the Vessel and the Ladle are related to the same Apūrva that is to say, there is a single Apurva in the case in question.
anyatra tu prakaraṇagṛcītasya pradhānabhūtasya kartuḥ saṃbandhī na virokyate /	And further, the significance of the Vessel does not give rise to any syntactical split &c., as has been shown to exist in the case of the signi ficance of Singleness and hence in the case in question, we should not be led away by the foregoing Adhikaraṇa. Sutra In the case of the performers qualifications, inas much as an action cannot inhere in another action, the sentence must be broken up.
sākāṅkṣaṃ tvekavākyaṃ syādasamāsaṃ hi pūrveṇa	The raising of this question, when the connection is distinctly men tioned by the sentence in question, is open to the same objections that were raised against the raising of the question of the Arunadhikaraṇa and in the present case also the objections are to be set aside in the same manner as in that connection. In the present case also, the Action is incorporeal, and its relationship is mentioned just as in the Aruṇādhikaraṇa and yet the present discussion is started, because the points in which the two discussions differ are as follows a in the previous Adhikaraṇa, it was the Substance that was found to be mentioned as coextensive, and hence it was the relationship of that Action which is accomplished by its means, that was found to be the means of restricting the application of that Substance while in the present case, it is that Relationship itself that has got to be established b in the former it was the Property, the method of whose connection with the action was known, that was wanted as the distinctive feature while in the present case, even the Action is not known with which there would be a connection and c in the while in the present case, in regard to all the various Homas, there is the same Priest that is the performer. Consequently the present Adhikaranu cannot be said to be a mere repetition of the Arunadhikarana.
sarvathā tāvadabhikrāmamityetatpadaṃ na kriyāntaramantareṇa nirākāṅkṣī bhavati/	The walking round pertains to all the Homas Because the Action, being incorporeal, is never cognized as one to be accomplished by means of another action and hence the walking round which is an action must be taken as enjoined as a qualification of the perform ance, without any connection with the verb juhoti which denotes an Action.
na hyetad dravyasaṃbandhaṃ kathaṃ ciḍhapi bravīti /	Sutra Inasmuch as it is in need of another relative, it must be taken along with the next word specially as the con nection of the word is not completed by what precedes it. other verb. Because it does not, in any way, express the relationship of a substance.
tasmātprakṛtaprayājayahijokavākyatvātādarthaṃ vijñā yate /	Consequently, inasmuch as it appears in the same sentence with the verb juhoti, which refers to the Prayājas, it is cognized as pertaining to these latter and it is capable of helping them by bringing them into proximity with their performing agent specially as they stand in need of the proximity of the officiating priest to the sacrificial Fire.
śakkoti ca kartṛpratyānattikaraṇena tadupakartum /	Thus then we find that it is quite possible for one action to help in the accomplishment of another action and as such one could very well be spoken of as the Sadhya of the other.

In this, the Samidhëni has been mentioned separately, simply with a view to discriminate between the existence and nonexistence of an intermediate context of the Samidheni. Objection The Context is one of the DarçaPūrṇamāsa only that is to “say, inasmuch as all things mentioned are taken up by the Prime Context there is no appearance of any intermediate contexts. Or again, inasmuch as the Samidhenis indicate the Kindling of the Fire, they are distinctly recognized as serving the purpose of a visible preparatory rite and as such there can be no context of these as they do not stand in need of anything else, wherewith they could form a Context.
nanu darśapūrṇamāsayoreva prakaraṇamiti mahāprakaragāgrastatvānnaivāvāntara prakaraṇānyāvirbhavanti naitadevam	Reply It is not so, because in all cases, there are as many processes as there are verbs and there is no obstacle in the way of the Process, put by the Primo Context,etc. and as a matter of fact, neither the contin gency of another Context, nor the Preparatory Rite, can ever set aside the Process. the same manner, the subsidiary Bhavanas, though complete within them selves, become connected with the final Bhavana of the DurçaPurna māsa and they do not, by this subservience to it, lose their own peculiar characteristics.
nānyaprakaraṇāpattiḥ saṃskāro vā vidanti tam	In fact, even in the case of such preparatory rites as bring about visible results, there is a certain trans cendentalism attaching to the restriction or specialization of the particu lar method of bringing about the visible result and thus there being a need of the mention of this method or process, there is an actual inter dependence of the Context.
dṛṣṭepi ca phannenaiva sāpekṣā na pravartate /	And even in the case of a visible result, the want of the mention of the method or process does not cease and that want is not supplied by any perceptible means.
dṛṣṭenaiva tu kenāpi sopāyena nivartyate evaṃ tarhi tasya sannikarṣeṇa balīyasvāttadaṅgatvenaiva bhavitavyamiti kuto mahāprakaraviniyogāśahā/	For these reasons it must be admitted that there is a subsidiary context which connects the wearing of the thread with the Recitation of the Samidheni. Objection In that case, the subsidiary context being more proxi mate to the Upavita, and hence more authoritative, it would distinctly point to the Upavita as connected with the Samidhëni and hence why should there be any question as to its applicability being controlled by the Prime Context ? Reply True, it would be so, if there were no likelihood of the connec tion of the Upavita with the Samidheni being taken as to be broken np.
uccate /	or interrupted by the intervention of the word Nivid.
satyametadevaṃ syādyadi tasya nivitpadavyavadhānena tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda / prakaraṇavicchedāśaṅkā na syāta/	Objection If the connection be broken up, then there would be Reply It is not so because, inasmuch as the text subsequently speaks of the Kämya Samidheni, there is some doubt as to the connection. of the Samidheni being broken up and hence the course of the Prime Context is not quite clear. Inasmuch as we have the mention of the ‘Sāmīdhëni both before and after that of the upavita, the Context of the Samidheni must be admitted to continue all along and as for the Nivids, they must be taken as mentioned, either as something wholly extraneous to the matter of the Context, or as subsidiary to it.
evaṃ tarhi vicchinne tasmina jitaṃ mahāprakaraṇeneti abhitaḥ sāmidhenīnāṃ kīrtanāt prakriyā sthitā /	That is to say, as a matter of fact we find, that in connection with the DarçaPurṇamāsa, the mantras mentioned as to be recited to Pushan, etc., do not break the original Context, even though they have no con nection with it, and in the same manner the words relating to the ‘nivid also would not break up the context of the Sāmīdhēnī.
para prakaraṇe pāṭho nividāmatha vāṅgatā	To the above we make the following reply Inasmuch as the context.
vicchinnā sāmighenīnāṃ nividbhiḥ prakriyā yataḥ / na hi kāmyaiḥ punaḥ kalpaiḥ saṃdhātuṃ sā hi śakyate	of the Samidheni is broken by the Nivids, it could not be linked up by the subsequent mention of the Kāmya SamidhēniRecitation. As a rule, the Context extends only to that extent up till where it perceives something capable of being used or applied in connection with it and then too, it is only that which is connected with something else, that is applied by means of the Context.

If, again, the nivids could be sub sidiary to the Sāmidhēnīs, then,in accordance with the law of the godohana, the container also being taken along with the contained, the Context of the Samidhenis could extend to the Kamya Samithēnī Recitation. And if the Kāmya SâmidhēniRecitation were subsidiary to the former SamidheniRecitation, then, in that case,as in the case of the mantrus recited to Pushan, etc., so here also, we could take the original Context of the Samidheni to be uninterrupted by the mention of the Nivids,these latter also being, somehow or other, taken along with it.
nanu ca yadi vicchinne prakaraṇe kāmyāḥ kalpāḥ śrayante tata ekaviṃśatyā pratiṣṭhāṃ bhāvaroṭikamāniyeta prakaraṇe nāśraye'nupanīyamāne sākāṅkṣatvādaparipūrṇatā prāpnoti /	Objection If the Kämya Recitation be taken to be mentioned after the Context has been stopped short by the mention of the Nicids, then, in the case of the Kāmya Iujunctionone should accomplish fame by means of the twentyonethe want of the particular substratum of the number twentyone would remain unsupplied, if we do not admit this substratum in the shape of the Samidheni to be pointed out by the Context and as such the Injunction would remain incomplete.
atha vākyenāśraya upanīyeta tataḥ prāpte karmaṇi saṃvandhayakaraṇādvākyaṃ bhidyeta /	If the “ required substratum were pointed out by Syntactical Connection, then, inasmuch as the sentence would be pointing out two relationships in connection with the enjoined action of Recitation, there would be a syntactical split.
tatra yadi vākyamedo 'bhyupagarakheta kathaṃ cidvā pariṭriyeta tato retīvāravantīyasaubharādiśvapyevameva vākyena prakṛtāśrayadānāsiddhānta hāniḥ /	Then, if this split we accepted as inevitable, and it be explained away somehow or other, then in the case of the Revati, the Vāruvanti and the Saubhara also, the required substratum would be pointed out by the Syntactical Connection, which would be in direct contradiction to the Siddhanta conclusious arrived at in connection with these Sāmas.
thāśrayāmārthaṃ kathaṃ cidanuvarteta prakaraṇaṃ tata upavītamapi tathaiva prāpnoti sarvathā saṃkaṭametat	Then if, for the sake of obtaining the required substratum, the Context were extended to the Kamya Recitation, then the Upavita also becomes taken up by that Context and thus there are two horns of the dilemma from which you can ill extricate yourself.
guṇātkāmā na yuktotra vicchinnaprakriyāśrayāt /	Reply In the case in question it is not proper to take the desired result fame as following from a qualifying detail, which has its substra tum disjoined by a ruptured Context and there cannot be an injunction of many things, unless there is an altogether new action involved.
naivātrai kaviṃśatyā darguṇātphalaṃ kiṃ taī tāvantīkaviṃśatyādarguṇātphalaṃ yāḍhivāya vaḍhevānenāpi viśiṣṭaṃ karma vidhīyate /	That is to say, the result mentioned does not follow from the qualify ing detail twentyone in fact, just like the sentences speaking of the Revati, etc., the sentenceone should accomplish fame by means of twentyonelays down an independent qualified Action and hence, in accordance with the Bhavarthadhikarana, the result must be taken as following from the Rootmeaning i.e.
ata ekaviṃśatyāḍhiviśiṣṭegānuvacanena pratiṣṭhādi sādhayet / kathamityanubrūyāditi śabdamāmānyā saṃkhyā pratyāsatteśca sāmidhenyanuvacanavaditi ga myate /	Recitation thus then, the sense of the injunction in question would come to be that one should bring about ame, etc., by means of Recitation qualified by twentyone and then, as to how it is to be brought about by this means, we come to understand that it is through the Recitation of the Samidhenis that it is brought about because the word anubrüyät is common to both the Samidheni and the ekavimçati, and because the numbers of these two are nearly the same i.e.
tataśca saṃkhyeyānācāmanyeṣāṃ ca dharmāṇa prāptiḥ /	seventeen and twentyone respectively.

Objection In that case, these other Recitations of the twenty one, not being taken up by the DarçaPurpumasa, would come to be done apart from the performance of these sacrifices.
sarvathopavītasya sarvārthatvasi tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	Reply In the first place, this argument does not set aside onr theory because even if it be as you urge, the Upavita comes to be con nected with all the Recitations in question which is all that the Siddhāntu clings to.
na ca svatantraḥ prayogaḥ syāt /	As a matter of fact, however, there could not be an independent.

For instance, that Recitation, which is performed before that of the Samidhenis, is not subsidiary to the Sāmidhēnīs, just like the Nivids and again, the injunc tion anubrüyat could be explicable, only if the Recitations were meant to be performed after the SamidheniRecitation, in connection with the DarçaPūrṇamāsa, and not independently by themselves. Then again, if they could be performed separately, though they would be recognized as subsidiary to the SamidheniRecitation, yet they would lose their charac ter of anuvacanatva being recited subsequently to something, if there were nothing else to be recited.
ekaviṃśatyādibhistāvadavaṇyaṃ sāmidhenyaḥ saṃkhyātavyāstāsvāgnisamindhanaṃ prakāśayantyaḥ sāmidhenya ityucyante	That is to say, it is absolutely necessary that the numbers, twenty one and the rest, should pertain to the Samidhenis and it is a known fact that these latter are so called, simply because they indicate the kindling of fire and this fire too that is pointed out by them, could only be one that is used at some other action than the Recitation itself.

To this we make the following reply Inasmuch as the Pavumānëshṭi offerings are shown, by syntactical connection, to be as primary in their character as the Kindling of fire,the said offerings cannot be taken as sub sidiary to the said Kindling and hence the vessels must be taken as belong ing to all sacrifices.
sa cāvirodhe viniyukta virodhe tu di devanādivatprakaraṇena bādhyate /	That is to say, that the said offerings are subsidiary to the Kindling of fire is shown only by the Context, while that they are subsidiary to the fire is shown by the Syntactical Connection of the sentence yadāhavaniyê juhoti and under the circumstances there can be no doubt as to the latter being the more authoritative of the two.
tasmātkṛtsnadarśapūrṇamāsārthamu pavītamiti siddham ānarthakyāttadaṅgeṣviti pavamānahaviṣṇu vijñāyante / tathā prāpte 'bhidhīyate	Against this way of putting forward the Siddhanta, the following objections are raised If the sentence yadahavaniye juhoti be taken as making the fire something to be purified or prepared by the Pavamāna offerings, then the fire would be recognized as to be purified by means of the Agnihotra etc., also which latter are equally mentioned in the same sentence. It might be argued that inasmuch as the Agnihotra, etc., bring about distinct results, the sacrificial fire is a part of them.
prakaraṇāgamyāṃ pavamānahaviṣāmādhānārthatāṃ bādhitvā vākyenāgnyarthatā vijñāyate	But in that case, of the Pavamana offerings also, it would be a part because one and the same sentence could not speak of the same sacrificial fire, as a subsidiary part of the actions leading to definite results, and as the primary factor of those not leading to any results as Simultaneous Injunction and Reference, Subject and Predicate, and Primary and Subsidiary are irreconcilable combinations.
saptamī caikatra dvitīyārthaṃ ja kṣayati anyatra svārthameva vadatīti virodhaḥ /	And your theory involves a further incongruity viz. that in one case the Locative in Āhavanīyë is taken as indicating the objective, while in another it is taken in its own original sense of location.
tathā ca viśvajidādīnāmaśrutaphalānāmaṅgatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	And further, in accordance with your argument, the Viçvajit, etc., which have no results mentioned as following from them, would all become subsidiaries.
sarvaṃ cāyuktametat /	And all this is most undesir ‘able and improper.
ni vpannaścāhavanīya upadiśyate niṣphalakarmānurodhena ca bhātṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	The former of these speaks of the fire as something to be prepared, and as such standing in need of the preparatory rites and consequently it can be taken as laying down the Pavamana offerings, etc., which have no results of their own, as the required preparatory rites. And the latter may be taken as laying down the fire as a wellestablished entity, calculated to serve as that into which the libations of all sacrifices are to be offered.
tasmātkalaivaṃ varṇanīyam ḍe hote vākye tulyarūpe pavamāna haviṣprakaraṇo ekam aparamanārabhyavāde /	And in this way there can be none of the incongruities urged above. The explanation that we have to offer is as follows There is no use in taking all this trouble of assuming a sentence in the shape of the second yadihavaniyê,etc. which does not exist specially as the incongruity is capable of another explanation even if the Pavamana offerings were subsidiary to the kindling of Fire, the vessels in question could not belong to those.

That is to say, there arising the argumentinasmuch as the Nivids are subsidiary to the Sāmidhēnis, a mention of those cannot interrupt or disjoin the Context,the sutra makes the following declara tion in answer The accessory details being, etc., etc., which has already been explained. The sense of the declaration is that inasmuch as the Nivida also, like the Samidhenis, speak of the kindling of fire, they are equally subservient to the purposes of the Fire and as such the one the Nivid could not be taken as subsidiary to the other the Samidhēni. Sutra There is no connection of the meanings of the two verses with the Primary. We now proceed to consider those cases in which the mantrus are employed in accordance with the order in which they happen to be mentioned.
kimanenāśrutāpanāśanānyathāpyetadupapadyataeva vadanti sāmidhenīvannividognisamindhanam /	Objection How is it that the immediate sequence operating both ways, it is the preceding Olosing of the Fist and the Silence that are To this some people make the reply that it is with a view to show the doubtful character of the situation, that what is mentioned first is taken up as the subsidiary, simply because it happens to be mentioned first.
saṃyuktatvādatastāsāṃ nāṅgaṃ prakaraṇena tāḥ	Consequently we must take the former two to be for the sole purpose of this Addressing.
mādhāraṇyena saṃyogaḥ saṃdigdhaḥ kālakarmabhiḥ /	· As a rule, Capability, Subsidiary Context, and Syntactical Connection are more authoritative, in the matter of application of the accessory details, than the Prime Context.
viruddhaḥ karmasaṃbandhe na kramaḥ kālasaṃgatau	Consequently in all cases, that which is mentioned first must be taken as serving the purposes of that which is mentioned next after it.
mithaśvānarthasaṃbandhādiṣṭo nāṅgāṅgisaṃgamaḥ / na hāsyanuvākyānāṃ pradhānararthasaṃgatiḥ śramāvāsyāṃtāvāmī naiva vidyamānārthā	i Then as for the Closing of the Fist and the Silence, the former is not taken as being for the sake of the latter, or vice versa, because they are not capable of being taken as subsidiary to each other specially as both serving the purpose of bringing about the attentiveness of the sacrificer, they do not stand in need of each other. To the above, we make the following reply We do not find any syntactical connection between the Olosing of the Fist and the Silence on the one hand, and the Addressing on the other as for Oupability, it applies equally both ways and as for the desire of any intermediate process, we do not find any appearing, at the time.
tasmātkālārtha evāyaṃ saṃyogoṅgāṅgikalpanāt /	That is to say, the two verbs could not be syntactically connected, until there were some word denoting such connection and so there is no syntactical connection in the case in question that could set aside the significations of the Prime Context.
nyāyyaḥ pūrvapratītatvātkāno hi duratikramaḥ na tāvaṭe kavākyatvaṃ dṛśyate yogyatā samā avāntarakathaṃbhāvastadānīṃ nāvagamyate	As a matter of fact, in the case in question, there is no intermediate context that could set aside the indications of the Prime Context. For when there is a deficiency in the process of the former action, then the latter becomes its subsidiary as a matter of fact, however, this is not possible because the object to be accomplished by the Bhāvanā is yet only incom pletely known and as long as the object is not fully recognized, there can be no desire to find out the process of its accomplishment.
na cottareṇāsāvaklṛpraprayojanābasthena śa kyaḥ pūrayitu, mevaṃ tasyāpyuttareṣeti yāvatpradhānaṃ prāptam /	Nor could the want, even if it had arisen, be supplied by the latterlymentioned action, because the use of this latter has still to be ascertained and so this latter also would stand in need of another action and so on and on, till we get to the Primary Action itself.
yadyevaṃ tato yontarāle guṇakāmaḥ tena saha sarvamāghastya maṅgaṃ saṃbadhyeta/ naiva pradhānaṃ yāvatprāpnuyādavāntarakathaṃbhāvasya niṣpannatvāditi /	Objection If it be so, then, whenever we would have, in the middle of a context, some sentence laying down the connection of a certain accessory detail with a definite desirable result, then, all that would follow after that would have to be taken as auxiliary to that accessory detail, and could not reach the Primary Action because in such a case the intermediate context will have been an accomplished fact.
pradhānakathaṃbhāvakhabhito 'nyasaṃbandhamātramukkā yāvadantaṃ ga cchatotyanuṣaṅgādhikaraṇe vyākhyātam /	Reply If the two accessories mentioned in the sentence viz., the Closing of the Fist and the Silence were known as belonging to the Address ing, then there could have been an intermediate context between those two and the Addressing. While as for the Process of the Primary Action, it operates on all sides and leaving only that which happens to be connected with something else, goes on to the very end of the context,as we have already shown under the Anushangadhikaraṇa IIi.
nanvevaṃ sati sarvāvāntaraprakaraṇoccheda eva prāpnoti /	Objection In that case, there is a total annihilation of all Inter mediate or Subsidiary Contexts.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda /	In a case, however, where there is no such subsequent mention of details, all that is mentioned must be taken as pertaining to the Primary Action.
vākyānāṃ ca samāptatvāt	Sūtra Also because the sentences are complete in themselves.
yata ekavākyatālakṣaṇameṣu pratyekaṃ dṛśyate na sarveṣu / tasmādapi nānyonyārthatā	That is to say, there is a further reason for rejecting the signification of immediate sequence viz., that each of the sentences under consideration has all the marks of a complete sentence, when taken singly, and not. Sūtra The auxiliary, connected with the Accessory Detail, should be taken as common to fall specially as there is no mutual relationship among them.
śakyate hi dvidevatyaḥ saṃjāyitu me kayā /	We have spoken of the application of accessory details, in accordance with the order in which they are mentioned and we now proceed to consider whether that application is possible to a part also, or only to the whole.
agnīṣomahaviyago manotāyāmivāgninā tathā pātnovatepyuktā tena tvaṣṭuratantratā /	The Quartering applies to the Agnishomiya and Aindrayna cakes also. Because the mention of a single Deity Agni in Agneya is capable of indicating the two Deities Agni and Soma, and Indra and Agni just as in the Manota, the Agni indicates the connection of both Agni and Soma.
tathā ḍityasya māteti mātā ḍitthaḍavityayoḥ tantravārtike /	Though Agni is not the proper Deity of the Aguishomiya, yet it is not wholly unconnected with it and it is the presence of the Deity, and not the actual fact of its being the Deity, that is the basis of indicativeness nor in the case in question, is Agni inseparably connected with the action of Quartering and as such much significance cannot be attached to the specification of Agneya and all that this can be taken as doing is to indicate the presence of Agni nor are the indicative factors to be taken exactly as they are mentioned for instance, the two cakes are taken as indicative of the time intervening between the Upamçuyāgas and again in the case of the mention of the Pathirata, no significance is attached to the specification of Tvashtr and lastly, even in ordinary parlance we find that the mother of Dittha and Davittha is spoken of as the mother of Dittha similarly the cake dedicated to Agni and Soma can be spoken of as Aguēya .
vyavasthā vārthasya śrutisaṃyogālliṅgasyārthena saṃbandhāllakṣaṇārthā guṇaśrutiḥ	Sutra There should be a restriction as the actual signification is connected with the word because the indi cative power is connected with such meaning and as for the subsidiary text, it serves the purposes of indication.
yathaiva hi grahatvena camasā nopalacitāḥ /	Just as in a previous Adhikaraṇa, we have found that the Ladles arc not indicated by the mention of graha so in the same manner, in the case in question, Aynēya cannot indicate the cakes dedicated to two Deities the Agnishomiya or the Aindragna.
āgneyatvaṃ tathā na syād dvidevatyopalakṣaṇam na hi vyāsaṅgivijñāna mekena vyapadiśyate / nāgnīṣomīya āgneya aindrāgno vā taducyate	And as a matter of fact, that the character of being the Agneya does not belong to the Agnishomiya and the Aindrāgna cakes is shown by the fact that the word Āgnēyu does not signify the mere presence of Agni what it does signify is the Deific character mentioned by the nominal affix, and the mention of Agni is merely by way of qualifying that deific character. That to which certain offerings are made is the Deity and as a matter of fact, the cake that is dedicated to two Deities Agni and Soma is not offered to Agni alone as that which has been known as pervading over two, cannot be spoken of by means of one only hence either the Agnishomiya or the Aindragna could not be spoken of as the Agnèya.
āgneya iti yo nirapecāgnidevatyaḥ sobhidhīyate / na ca dvidevatye nirapekṣognirdevatā tenāyaṃ tadvito nāgnīṣomādigatāgniśabdādutpadyataiti na tadarthasya devatātvamāha /	Then again, in the word Agneya, the indicative power belongs to the signification of the Nominal Affix and according to Papinis rule IVi nominal affixes are applicable to ouly such words as are capable of direct denotation and for this reason the nominal affix cannot be taken as appertaining to the word Agni as forming a compound with Soma, and as such not being by itself capable. That is to say, that alone is spoken of as Agneya, which belongs to Agni alone, independently of all other Deities and certainly that which is dedicated to two Deities is not one that is dedicated to Agni alone. and as such the nominal affix in the word Agnèya does not signify the deific character of Agnishoma while that wheroof Agni alone is the Deity is always spoken of as Agnėya.
deśaviśeṣajrakṣaṇārthāsminnāgneya guṇa śrutiḥ sāmānyavākyena sarvatra prāśināvadāne prāpte mastakavitṛtīyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pāda / roga viśeṣa vidhānārthame tadvacana miti vaiṣamyam	Then as for the corroborative instance of the Pracitra that the Purva paksha has brought forword, in that case the subsidiary mention of the Agneya is meant to be indicative of a particular place. That is to say, the general sentence having pointed out the performability of the Prāçitrā vadana cutting of the Praçitra cake in all places, what the subsequent sentence ‘ägnēyasya mustakam virujyu, etc., does is to lay down the parti. cular breaking up of the head of the cake and thus there is no similarity between this and the case in question. Some people take exception to the Adhikarana presented as above.
taṃ caturddhā kṛtvā puroḍāśaṃ barhiṣadaṃ karotīti /	And the rule has been laid down by him in accordance with a passage that he met with in the Catapatha Brāh ‘maṇaviz., ‘ tancaturdhā kṛtvā puroļāçam varhishadam karoti which speaks of ‘puroḍāça in general as quartered.
avaśyameva sāmānyaṃ viśeṣaṃ prati gacchati/ gatamātraṃ ca tattena viśeṣe sthāpate dhruvam iti śrībhaṭṭakumārilakhāmiviracite tantravārtika tṛtīyasyādhyāyasya prathamaḥ pādaḥ samāptaḥ	To this we make the following reply It is quite true that we have the above text speaking of the Quartering as applying to all cakes in general but it is restricted to particular cakes by means of passages found in other Rescensional Texts. It might be argued thatin the case of the Praçitra also we could take the subsequent sentence as restricting the former general Injunction. But this is not possible as the sentence speaking of that is meant to lay down an accessory detail t.e., the expression having broken the head distinctly lays down such a detail with regard to the head and as such it is incapable of restricting the preceding general Injunction in the case in question on the other hand, the sentence Ãgnēyam, etc., makes the repeti tion without mentioning any accessory detail and as such it is quite capable of restricting to itself the general Injunction of Quartering.
arthābhivānasaṃyogānmantreṣu śeṣabhāvaḥ syāttasmādutpattisaṃbandho 'rthena nityasaṃyogāt	But this cannot hold because of the general law that that which is connected with something else, through its meaning, is to be taken along with it and hence the general rule always goes forward to meet the special and as soon as it has met this latter, it becomes restricted to that particular case.
idānīṃ liṅgaviniyogaḥ stūyate /	Thus then, it is established that the Quartering is to be done to the Ayněya cake only.
ciṅgaṃ nāma mantrāṇārthapratyāyana sāmarthyam /	Sutra Inasmuch as the auxiliary character of the Mantra would be based upon the meaning expressed by it, the connec tion of the Mantra should be with the primary meaning as it is with this that it has eternal connection.
tacca mukhye gauṇe ca kena citprakāreṇa vi dyate / tatra viniyogaḥ kiṃ mukhyaevārthe bhavatta gauṇapati saṃdehe naiva gauṇo nāma kaścidastīti mandāna āha ka punarmukhyaḥ ko vā gauṇa iti /	By Linga is meant the capability of the Mantra to signify something and as a matter of fact, this capability is sometimes found to pertain to the direct primary, and sometimes to the indirect secondary, meaning. And hence in the case of Mentras, it is doubtful whether they are to be used in their primary sense, or in the secondary one. Some people, labouring under the impression that there is no second ary meaning of Mantras, have put the question What is the Primary, and what the Secondary? In the Sutras I iv et seq.
tatmidvisūtre tu siddhe gauṇe tannimittabhedaḥ svārthāparityāgavṛttitvaṃ ca vyākhyātamityayamarthādvicāraḥ pūrvaṃ pratyetavyaḥ /	we have taken for granted the exis tence of the secondary signification as an established fact, and then considered the varions bases of such signification, which have been shown to be incapable of abandoning the Primary signification and hence the discussion that we are taking up now wherein we are going to establish the existence of the Secondary signification must be taken as really preceding the Sutra Iiv.
śākhādibhyo ya ityevamivārthe mukhya ityayam / śabdaḥ śabdābhidheyatvātsarveṣveva prasajyate	The answer to the above question, given by the Bhashya, is as fol lows The direct denotation of the words of the Mantra is the Primary or “ Mukhyu,” because, like the face, ‘mukha of the human fortus, it is the first to appear and the Secondary or Gauna is that which is implied by that denotation it is called Gauna because it is due to the presence of certain property or Guya.
śabdārthasyaiva sāhityāḍha bhivyaktiriyaṃ kṛtā /	The above interpretation of the word Mukhya is also supported by its etymologythe word being formed as Mukhaya, in accordance with the Sutra Panini Viii, the uffix denoting similarity hence ‘Mukhya is that which is similar to the mukha or face.
anyasya dyotakatvāttu nāpetaṃ mukhyanada pam	Against these definitions, the opponent raises the following objec.
tadyathā gavādiśabdānāṃ pṛthivyādiḥ /	tions Inasmuch as the word is denoted by the word gabda, it would apply equally to all meanings of words.
athoṣapaḍhasya dyotakatvaṃ parityajya tulyakalpatocyate yasmānnityaṃ māṇatra kāgniśabdasamudāyādasyārthasya pratītiḥ ato 'śvakarṇādivatsamudāyavācyatve satyavayavasya gauṇatvamiti /	That is to say, it is absolutely impossible for the property of one thing to appear in another and hence the guuna or secondary cannot be explained as due to the appearance of a property. Thus then, whenever a word is uttered, if a certain meaning is found to be expressed by it, either directly or in directlyit inevitably leads to the assumption of a corresponding expres sive potency in the word and whether the meaning be the direct or the indirect one, it is, in either case, uninterrupted by any other meaning and as such, being the first to be comprehended, it must be called mukhya or Primary and thus all meanings are equally mukhya.
tatṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	Having disposed of the definition given in the Bhashya, wo proceed to consider the other definitions.
tatra samudāyaprasiddhirbhavati yatrāvayavārthī tirodhāya vyaktabhedaḥ samudāya eva pratīyate /	That is to say, in all cases, a definition is that which serves to differentiate a thing from others and there is no doubt that the gauna or secondary meaning is that which depends upon something else.
gamyate tvacāgniśabdasya paiṅgalyaṃ māṇavaka śabdasya ca piṇḍasvarūpaṃ viviktaṃ vācyamata ubhāvapi prātyātmikayorapi vācakatvānmukhyāviti / idānīmavayavānusāreṇaiva samudāyārthatvaṃ samarthayamāna āha /	If you deny the illuminative character of the second word, and take both words to be equally expressive of the meaning in question, on the ground that the expression agnirmāṇavakaḥ is always found to be expressive of that meaning then in that case, the meaning in question would have to be accepted as expressed by the two words taken collec tively, and as such the expression would be similar to the compound word açvakarṇa denoting a plant and on that account, each of the component words both agni and māṇavaka would have to be accepted as herein used in their secondary meanings! As a matter of fact, however, the meaning in question could not be taken as expressed by the two words collectively because, from con comitance as well as nonconcomitance in usage, we find the two words having two distinct meanings.
anugata svārtha paḍhadayagamyatvānnīlotpannavadvākyārtho 'taca tasya padārthapratyāyyatvācchabdaṃ prati pūrvavadeva gauṇatvamiti tannirākaroti	Two words are known as one compound word only in a case where the meaning of the component parts is completely set aside, and the parts themselves are cognised as insepa rable. In the case of the expression Agnirmāṇavakaḥ, however, we find that while the word Agni expresses something yellowish and bright, the word Mänavaka denotes a wholly different thing, a certain aggregate of physical matter and as such both words, expressing something distinct, are found to be used in their primary meaning.
na tvatra tadīyo mukhyārtho'gnitvamasti /	.
na ca bhavataḥ paiṅgalyaṃ vācyamasmatyakṣābhedaprasaṅgāttasmānna vākyārthaḥ /	As a matter of fact, however, we find that the word ayniḥ cannot be taken in its primary sense of agnitva as this does not inkere in the Boy nor can you hold it to be directly siguificant of bright yellowishness because that would bring you over to our side hence the meaning in question cannot be regarded as that of a sentence.
tena ccalane māṇavakasya ca paiṅgalye tunyavacchanda pravṛttiriti mukhyatvama/	Consequently it must be admitted that the functioning of the word Agni is exactly of the same character, with reference to fire, as also with reference to the brightness of the Boy and hence both these meanings should be regarded as equally Primary.
māṇavakasyeti bhāṣye paiṅgalyavyatireka janitā ṣaṣṭhī nābhidhātṛvyatire kajanitā / na hi māṇavaka svarūpamagniśabdāgamyate/	“In the Bhashya we have the sentence agniçabdo māṇavakasya abhi dhätä and the genitive in mänavakasya denotes the connection of the Boy with Brightness, and not that with the denoting word agni. Because, in the first place, the form of the Boy is not cognized from the word agni, and secondy, because if the two words were wholly synonymous, the two could never have been used at the same time.
na hi paryāyatve māṇavakaśabdaḥ prayujyeta / athocyeta yaḥ prasiddha iti mukkopapadavyāpāraṃ yatkṛtaṃ tasyāśrayaṇamanāśrayaṇaṃ ca te eva mandasuṣṭuprasiddhī gauṇamukhya vibhāgāya darśayasuṣṭhu ti/	The following reasoning might be brought forward That which is well known as the denotation of a word is its Primary meaning, etc.,etc. That is to say, not taking into consideration the operation of the second word, we shall admit, as the basis for declaring the Primary and Secondary character of meanings, the fact of their being well or not well known respectively, on which fact is based the use of the companion word in such sentences as agnirmāṇavakaḥ.
tatrottaram	To this argument, we make the following reply The prasiddhi of a meaning consists only in its being comprehended, and nothing more or less and hence the differentiation of the Primary and the Secondary cannot very well be said to be based upon that.
idānīṃ śroṭagataprasiddhibhedamūnaṃ vaktṛgataṃ bahvalpaprayogitvaṃ vibhāgārthaṃ darśayati / yasya ca bahuśaḥ prayoga ityādi / tannirākriyate	“ Our opponent next proceeds to show that the required differentia tion would be made on the ground of the greater or less extent of the use made by the speaker, in consideration of the greater or less know ledge of the person spoken to and to this effect he makes the follow ing declaration That which is most used etc.,etc. And to this we make the following reply If a certain denotative potency of a word has been onco recognized, it cannot be rejected, even it be found to be used very little and hence there cannot be any difference between the greater used and the less used.
iccāpi ca gośabdasya pṛthivyādau mandasuṣṭuprasiddhiprayogo darśayitavyai	In this connec tion also we can cite the example of the word go, which is accepted as equally primarily expressive of the Cow and the Earth, though it is very much more used in the former sense than in the latter.
satyapi tāvanmāṇavakasāmānādhikaraṇye 'ruṇāśabdanyāyena sati sādṛśye 'bhidhānādasati cānabhidhānādanyatrāsādṛśyavati vṛttidarśanādasati cādarśanādiśeṣaṇatvāda vaśyaṃbhāviprathamapratyāyane sādṛśyameva prathamaṃ pratyāyayitavyam / na cānavagate'gna tatpratīyataiti prathamataramagnerabhidhānam / tataśca tatsaṃbandhādeva śeṣapratīte rvyaktivadanabhidheyatvam/	We now proceed to show the difference between the Primary and the Secondary mearfings Though there is a coextensiveness of the meaning of the word agni with the māṇavaka, yet, in accordance with the rule arrived at in connection with the word arund, as we find that there is a denotation by the word Agni if there is some similarity between that and the Boy, and none when there is no such similarity, and also that the word Agni is used also in connection with things other than the Boy, when such things are found to have some sort of a similarity with it, and not in connection with those that have no such similarity, it is this similarity to, Agni that is the necessary qualification and as such it is this similarity that is the first to be denoted by the word Ayni then inasmuch as the similarity to Agni cannot be cognized until the Agni or Fire itself is cognized, the Fire comes to be expressed even before the Similarity and all the rest in the sentence agnirmanavakaḥ, being indicated by the relationship of that Similarity which indicates the Boy as qualified by it, does not come to be spoken of as directly expressed, being, in this matter, just like the Individual which is held to be indicated as the correlative of the Class which is denoted by the word.
manti caivamādiṣu kāni cidrapādisāmānyānītyuktam /	And we have already explained that there are various common propertiessuch as brightness etc.belonging to the Fire and to the Boy.
tasmādasti gauṇa mukhya vibhāga ityārabhyamadhikaraṇam /	Thus then, there being an actual difference between the Primary and the Secondary, it becomes necessary to proceed with the question started in the present Adhikaraṇa.
evaṃ ca tatmidvisūtroktaḥ saha nava gauṇapacā draṣṭavyāḥ	Thus then, together with the three alternatives of the secondary character spoken of under Sutra Iiv, there are nine such alterna tives as follows Indicating something after wholly renouncing its own meaning, a mixture of both, assumption, operating with the help of a companion word, the two words taken together as one composite whole, the whole taken as a sentence, the lesser extent of its knowledge, the lesser extent of usage having shown the impossibility of admitting any of these eight alternatives, we have established above the ninth definition of the secondary character.
evaṃ ca sati gauṣṭyā vṛttyā pūṣādiśabdaragnyādyabhidhānādanutkarṣo bhaviṣyatya, nyathā yatra pūṣādayastatra noyeraṃ, stathāgnyādiśabdaiḥ sūryādyabhidhānādavikāre satyārṣacodako 'nugrahīṣyate /	Tasmuch as the word is always subservient to something else, both the Primary and the Secondary meanings are equal because nothing more is gained by the direct denotation of a word. The advan tage gained by this view is that, when we find, in the context of the DarçaPurnamāsa, certain mantras with the word Pushan, we do not find it necessary to remove these mantras to another sacrifice, even though there is no such deity as Pushan in the DarçaPurnamāsa because the word Pushan indirectly indicates Agni, which is a Deity at that sacrifice while if any preference were to be shown to the direct denotation of the word Püshan, then it would be necessary to “ remove the mantras from the context in which they are actually men tioned in the Veda. In the same manner, inasmuch as the word Agni would indicate the Sürya, the Injunction that the ectype is to be performed in the same way as the archetype would be duly fol lowed, even without changing the words of the mantra i.e.
ityevaṃ prāpta brūmaḥ /	To the above, we make the following reply Mantras become auxili.
arthābhidhāna saṃyogānmantrāṇāṃ kratuśeṣatā /	aries to sacrifices, only on account of their capability of expressing cer tain meanings and when they have this purpose served by their direct Primary meanings, the acceptance of their secondary meaning would in volve the necessity of assuming another text.
mukhyena ca kṛtārthānāṃ na gauṇe śrutikalpanā	Sutra The Mantra, being a sanctificatory agent, could not apply to that which is not enjoined.
api ca	sense, applying to Indra.
pākṣikatve 'pyanityatvātpakṣenarthakatā bhavet /	The sentence of the Bhashya in question however could be taken as meaning that the sucrificial Fire is a qualification of the Description, i.e., of the rootmeaning apart from the denotation of the affix in upatishthatë.
tenaiṣa sūtrārtho yasmādarthābhidhāna saṃyogānmantreṣu śeṣabhāvasta smaḥ da /tpatti ke naivārthenaiṣāṃ saṃyogaḥ syāt / kuta, stenaivāvyabhicā ritayā nityasaṃyogāt	That is to say, what is incompatible is the fact of the Fire and the Mantra both pertaining to the same Action i.e., the Fire can not be the objective of that of which the Mantra is the instrument and the Mantru cannot be the instrument of that of which the Fire is the objec tive. Then in the word upatishthatë, which is made up of a Verbal Root and an Affix, there are two functions mentioned the Root denoting “the standing, and the Affix expressing Description.
yāgānumantraṇānīti samākhyā kratuyojinī /	ready explained the agency of the Fire with reference to the Description and what is mentioned is the fact of the Fire being the direct objective of that which is expressed by the affix.
tasmācchaktyanurodhena prāptistadevate ṛtau	Thus then, the meaning of the Injunction, contained in the sentence in question, comes to be that, one should describe Indra while standing by the sacrificial Fire.
to viśeṣacintāyāma śakyeṣva niyojanāt / śabdārtha viniyogāya liṅgavyāpārasaṃbhavaḥ	Though, on account of the denotation of the Affix being the predominant factor, it would be proper for the Fire to be spoken of as the objective of that, yet, on account of its inherent incapability of being such an objective, it is separated from that and taken as the objective of that action which is denoted by the verbal Root.
tatrānavādarūpatvā mantrāṇāṃ gauṇateṣyate /	To the above, we make the following reply On account of the sub sequent direction, the Mantra cannot be taken in its primary meaning.
gāīpatyastāvad dvitīyayā pradhānasya pratyayārthasya karmeti śrutyā gamyate / tenaindrayā sa prakāśayitavyaḥ / tatra yadyathārthatvaṃ vajanānurodhena saṃjātaṃ tathā nāmetyadhyavasātavyam/	Because when it becomes necessary to take one of the twothe Brāhmaṇa or the Mantra, in its indirect secondary meaning, it is always the Mantra that is so taken because this latter is merely descriptive in its character. For instance, in the case in question, it is directly denoted by the Accusative ending in ‘gārhapatyam, that this Fire is the objective of the principal action expressed by the affix in uputisṭhatē and hence the Aindri mantra in question must be taken as to be employed in the des cription of that Fire. And then, if in consideration of the subsequent direction aindryā gārhapatyam upatishthate, the Mantra comes to lose its primary signification, it must be accepted as an inevitable fact.
avaśyaṃ bhāvi hyatra brāhmaṇasya mantrasya vā gauṇatvam/	Be cause it is absolutely necessary to take either the Brahmana aindrya garhapatyametc. or the mantra nivēçunaḥ,etc. in the indirect secon dary sense.
tatra brāhmaṇasyātyantāprāptavidhitvātprathama pravṛtteścānanyapramāṇake 'rthe gauṇatvamayuktam /	But, as for the Brāhmaṇa, inasmuch as it embodies the Injunc tion of something not mentioned elsewhere, it is the first to function and hence in a matter which is not amenable to the authority of any other means of knowledge save the Vedic Injunction, such a Brāhmaṇa sentence cannot be taken in the secondary sense.
mantrasya tu brāhmaṇacoditārthaprakāśanāt tatparatantravṛ tteḥ virodhinaṃ svārthamatotya mukhyaṃ yukto hi gauṣārthanimittabhāvaḥ	As for the Mantra, on the other hand, it is found to be descriptive of things laid down in the Brāhmaṇa sentence, and hence it depends, for its functioning, upon that sentence consequently it must be taken in its indirect secondary signification, as apart from its primary meaning, which is incompatible with the Brāh mana sentence, In this way we are saved from the contingency of taking the Accnsa tive as indicating agency in general, whereby the Fire could be connected as a qualification as urged in the Purvapaksha.
na cāvayavasaṃbandhādindro gṛhapateryataḥ / tena gārhapatyaḥ syādṛḍhyā 'gnipratyayād dṛḍhāt	Nor could the word gärhapatya in any way be etymologically explained as denoting Indra consequently the word cannot but be taken in its universally recognized primary meaning of Fire. Sūtra Even though the relationship of the word to its meaning is not created by scriptural injunctions, yet the Description in question would pertain to the Fire, in view of certain common properties.
gauṇepi tāvadetasya vṛttiḥ lośena jāyate /	Objection As a matter of fact we find the mantra wholly incap able of being applied to the Fire.
atyantāsahaśatvāttu na gauṇopyatra dṛśyate na vādeṅguṇavaccha/	Because, in the first place, it involves much trouble to take the word Indra in the mantra in its secon dary signification and then too, inasmuch as there is not the least similarity between Indra and Fire, the word could not, even indirectly, indicate the Fire. Even a hundred directions could not make the word Indra capable of denoting the Fire.
na hi śabdārthasaṃvandhaḥ prasiddhaḥ śāvacetukaḥ	Nor is Indra a technical name for the Fire, like the technical name of guna given to at and ‘ēñ because the relationship of the word to its signification is not known to be based upon scriptural injunctions.
syādagnegaṇamindratvaṃ yajñasaṃbandhakāritam / indatyarthānumārādvā svakārye sopi hīśvaraḥ	Reply It is quite possible for fire to be indirectly spoken of as Indra, because of the connection of both with the sacrifice, because the word Indra is made up of the root indi which signifies supreme lordship, and the Fire also is the supreme lord over its own actions and as such it is quite capable of being called Indra.
na kālavidhiyoditatvāt	Sutra Not so as it is the Injunction of time because it is actually known as such.
cirabhyāsaparatvāttu na mantrotra vidhīyate / lakṣaṇe ca śaturvṛttiḥ prāptaṃ cānyadanūdyate	Inasmuch as the subsequent Direction distinctly pertains to the threefold repetition, it cannot be taken as laying down the Mantra speci ally as the affix çatr in avaghnan denotes a qualifying character istic and it is this characteristic that is referred to in the Direction. And thus our view of the case does not militate against the direct meaning of any word.
yogyatvena ca siddhatvātkāyopi na vidhīyate / abhimānamevāssa vidhirityabhidhīyate	the calling, the reciting of the mantra, the Agent, etc.,etc. and nothing else as all else would bring about a split of the sentence. e Then as for the Time, inasmuch as its existence is implied by its own inherent capability, it cannot be taken as enjoined by the Direction. in question and what the sutra means by Injunction, is only mere mention or Declaration.
tathā ca yāvajjīvakobhyāsa ityatra kālābhyāsayoranyonyavidhihetutvaṃ vyākhyātam/	As we have already explained, in connection with the direction yāvajji vikobhyasaḥ, that the Time and the Repetition are the cause of each others Injunction.
atha yaduktaṃ intireva iviṣkṛsaviṣyatīti /	a It has been urged by the Purvapaksha, that the Threshing could he taken as the Huvishkṛt.
tatroccate athavā paḍhottarametatmatram /	And to this, we make the following reply Sutra Because of the nonexistence of property.
trirabhyāsaparatvāttu na maṃntrotra vidhīyate / rūpādevāvaghātāṅgaṃ bhavatviti taducyate	In denying the application of the Mantra to the Threshing, on account of the nonexistence, in it, of the property of Havishkrt,what we mean is that it is not capable of being called or addressed, which calling is distinctly mentioned by the words of the mantra.
āmantraṇa vibhaktiśva praiṣaśvehoti madhyamaḥ / vyartha mantre bhavetsarvamavaghātapare sati	On the other hand, when the Mantra is applied to the sacrificers wife, who is an animate and intelligent being, all that has been indicated becomes appli cable and useful consequently the words of the Mautra cannot be accepted as applying it to the Threshing.
liṅgāca	Sūtra Also, on account of the implications.
evaṃ ca vāgityartharūpeṇaikāntikenaiva strītvena saṃstavo bhaviṣyati / anyathā'nupāttasvīliṅgakriyā dipadenā nekāntāvyakaliṅgena śavdadharmatayā kathaṃ citkalpyaḥ syāttasmādāhānāṅgatvamiti	G Close upon the sentence under consideration, we find the sentence Vägvai havishkrt, where we find the maker of the offering material enlogised distinctly as a feminine character and this would be applicable only to the sacrificers wifo as otherwise if it were taken as applying to the Threshing, inasmuch as the action of Threshing has not its gender restricted to the feminine,being, as a matter of fact, of an im perceptible gender,the enlogy in question could be applied to it, only indirectly, by applying the word Kriyà which is in the Feminine gender.
tathotthānavisarjane	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the mantra is subsidiary to the Calling.
atideśasūtratvātsarve pūrva sūtrārthā yojayitavyāḥ / pūrvānuvāde kālārthatvamuktam idānoṃ vidhānārthepīti viśeṣaḥ /	Sūtra There would be an incompatibility of the Injunc tion, if the mantra in question were taken as applying to Threshing. Sūtra So also with riísing and giving vent. The present sutra is an Atidēçasūtra, and as such all that has been said under the foregoing Adhikarana is to be construed along with this also.
triramyānaparatvācca tatra mantropadeśo na jāto na vi tatheti pūrvapakṣe bojam/	The basis of the present Purvapaksha lies in the fact that in the case of the Directive sentence considered in the previous Adhikarana, we found that it could not be taken as enjoining the Mantra, because it was taken up by the injunction of the threefold repetition and the case with the sentences in question is not so.
utthānenāgniridhyataityanenotyānaṃ prakāśyataiti pratipādyate	This is what is meant by the answer given in the Bhashyathat if the mantgas were to be recited in connection with the rising and the giving vent, it would be so, only with a view to an imperceptible end.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	And further, we shall explain later on that the Second Person is not possible unless there is a certain direction.
devatā prakāśanugdhāraṇābhyāṃ kṛtārthatvādaṅgāṅgibhāvāpekṣā nāstīti kālārthatā /	The Suktuvāka i.e., the mantra Idam dyäväprithivi,etc. serves the purpose of pointing out the Deity, and the Prastura the Bundle of grass serves as the place for the keeping of the Sruk and hence both of these, having their purposes served independently of each other, do not stand in need of being related to each other by the relationship of the Primary and the Subsidiary aud hence the sentence must be taken as pointing out the Time.
prastarakṛtārthatvābhidhānaṃ ca pratipādyamāna pradhānatvādasya sūktavākāṅgatvaṃtahācyadevatāṅgatvaṃ vā na ghaṭataityasya pratipādanārtham /	The Bhashya speaks of the Bundle of grass having its purpose fulfilled and the sense of this is that inasmuch as the Bundle of grass is the “objective of the Pratipattikarma offering of Disposal, it has a certain predominance attaching to it and as such it could not be taken as subsidiary, either to the Siktavāka, or to the Deity mentioned in the Sūktavāka. Sūtra The sentence contains an Injunction of the mantra with reference to the Offering of the GrassBundle as other wise the name Yājyā could not be applied to it, without reason. cannot be set aside specially because of the great authority attaching to the signification of the caseending in saktavākēna .
tathā sadeva tasya sūktavākasyāpi tadaṅgatvamiti /	Thus then, the word ‘sūktavāka would, in its direct meaning, be connected with the Action otherwise what would be connected with the action would be the time indirectly indicated by the Saktavāka.
tathā cāṅgatve sati sādharmyādyājyāśabda upapatsyate / sūktavāka eva yājyeti /	And it is only the Sûktavāka that is taken as subsidiary to the Action and being thereby similar in character to the other subsidiaries of sacrifices, it becomes capable of having the name yajya applied to it as is done in the declaration ´sūktavāka evä yājyāçabdaḥ.
kiṃ punarasya pāramārthika me va yājyātvamutopacāramātram /	In connection with this last declaration, a sidequestion is raised as to whether the Suktavāka is a real Yajyā, or the name is applied to it only figuratively.
kaścātra viśeṣaḥ / sati yājyātve tad mairbhavitavyam / āsīno yajatyanavānaṃ yajati /	The difference made by these two is very great for instance, if it be a real Yajya, all the accessory details laid down in connection with Yajyas would apply to the Süktavāka also,such details as are mentioned in the sentences, asini yajati, anavinam yajuti, yajyāyā adhi vashatkaroti, purānuvākynica prathamam.
paronuvākyāṃ ca prathamaṃ prayukai tyādibhiḥ /	prayunktë while if the name were applied to it only by way of Praise, then none of the said details would have to be observed.
atha stutimātraṃ tato naiṣāṃ kaścidādartavya iti / kiṃ prāptaṃ bhavitavyaṃ dharmeḥ yayejyate mā yājyā sūktavākena cejyate tammādasti yājyātvam /	On this sidequestion, we have the following Purcapaksha All the said details should be observed because a Yajya is that whereby a sacrifice is performed and as a sacrifice is performed by means of the Sūktavāka, there is no doubt as to this latter being a real Yējyā.
tatraitatyādakhīliṅgatvādanuci tantravārtike / strīpratyayo na prāpnoti/	Against this, the following argument might be urged The feminine affix in Yajya would not be compatible with the Suktuvāka, which, not being a Rk, is devoid of the feminine character. But this does not affect our position because we find the name Yajya applied to the samid yajyä, etc., which are not Rks.
samidādiyājyāsvanakṣvapi yājcātvaprasiddheḥ / athocyetāvardhaveṣu darvihomasādhaneṣu satyapi yāgakaraṇatve yājyātvaṃ na dṛṣṭamato naitaṭai kāntikaṃ kāraṇamiti /	Then, it might be urged that in the case of the sacrificial accessories, mentioned in the Yajurvedu, we find that even though they are accessories in the performance of sacrifices, they are not called ‘yījyās and hence the mere fact of being accessory in the performance of sacrifices cannot be sufficient ground for the application of the name Yajya hence that alone should be accepted as Yajya, which is actually spoken of as Yājyā. w But, in that case, inasmuch as we have the declaration suktavāka eva yajya the said accessory details would certainly apply to the Sūktavāka.
yatraiva yājyāśabdaḥ prayuktaḥ saiva kevannā yājyā tena tarhi saktavāka eva yājyetyatrāpi prayogādbhavitavyaṃ dhamaiṃ, na cāsyaupacārikatvaṃ mukhyakāraṇasannidheḥ pratyakṣatvāt / a pi ca sāmānya śabdoyaṃ yājyeti sa na śakyo lakṣaṇamantareṇa prayogato viviktaviṣayo 'vadhārayitum /	Nor can this declaration be taken as applying the name only figuratively because we find the two quite proximate to each otherwhich is the principal basis of direct relationship. Then again, the word ‘yäjyä is a generic term and as such could not be taken as applying to certain definite things only, unless we had a definition distinctly laid down as governing its application and such a definition would be something like this That which, mentioned in the section on Homa, is found to be an auxiliary in the performance of sacrifices, is Yājyā and this definition would be quite applicable to the Sûktaraka. Consequently, it must be admitted that the Suktavāka is a “ real Yījyā, and this name is directly applicable to it.
tatraivalakṣaṇaṃ syāt /	In reply to this, we have the following Siddhanta arguments.
caitreṇa yenejyate tadvastu yājyeti /	That mantra, by which the sacrificing priest offers the sacrifice to the Deity connected with that sacrifice, is the Yajya because such is the univer sally recognized fact.
tathā sati sūktavākrepi prasaṅgaḥ/	And, as a matter of fact, the Suktavāka is not such a mantra.
prakṛtau hi sarva̭meva tādarthyotpattyā vastu nirūpyate /	As a rule, in all Primary sacrifices, everything connected with it is recognized as appearing in some such form as serves some useful purpose in the action.
yājyātvaṃ ca tyajyamāna havirdevatoddeśārthavihita mantratvenāvadhāritam /	And as for the character of the Yajya, it is found to consist in the fact of a mantra being laid down as serving the purpose of pointing to the Deity of the offered material.
na ca sūktavākastyajyamāna prastaradevatoddeśārthamutpannaḥ /	As for the Suktavāka, it has not been mentioned, in the orginative Injunction, as serving the purpose of pointing to the Deity of the grassbundle as all that it does, is to men tion the Deities to whom offerings have been made.
iṣṭadevatābhidhāna svarūpatvā, liṅgaṃ śrutyā bādhyataiti cet na / śruteliṅga viniyogābhyanujñāmantareṇāgni se kādivada sāmarthyāttathā cottarasūtre vacyāmaḥ /	It might be urged that the indicative power of the words of the Sūktavāka would be set aside by the superior authority of the Direct Declaration suktavākēna prastaram prahurati. But this is not possible because we shall show in the next sutra. that the Direct Declaration of a text is incapable of restricting the applica tion of the mantra unless it is supported by the indications of the words of the mantra itself,this incapability being as pronounced as that of the declaration ‘agninā siñcati.
tena svatastāvanna yājyātvam /	Thus, then, we cannot admit the Sūktavāka to be a real yājyä.
na cānyā kā cidevaṃviṣayā yājyāsti yasyāḥ kārye vartamāno yājyādharmakabheta /	Nor is there any such Yōjyā, as in which being contained, the Sūktavāka could take to itself the details luid down for the Yajyä.
athaivaṃ parihriyeta vinaiva tāvadyājyāvyapadeśena sūktavākamātratayā gṛhyamāṇo yāge viniyujyeta tato yājyātastadabhidheyadevatāsaṃbandhanabhyayāgatvapradhānapraharaṇasaṃbandhādyājyātvaṃ labhyataiti /	by reason of its connection with the Offering Praharana in which the predominant element is the sacrificial character, which is pointed out by its connection with the Deity mentioned in the Yājyā maṇtra and thus there would be no mutual interdependence. M To this we make the following reply That which has not been known as Yājyā, either in the originative Injunction, or in its applica tion, how could it ever, subsequently, be known as having that character P That is to say, it is only such a word as is wholly unknown,the word yūpa f.i.,that can be taken in a sense indicated by the use to which it is subsequently found to be put.
ayaṃ punaryājyāśabda utpattivelāyāmeva viniyogavelāyāṃ vārthaṃ labhamāno nottarakājabhāvamapekṣate /	The word Yājyā, however, is one that has its meaning well known, both at the time of the origina tive Injunction, and at that of its application and as such it does not stand in need of any subsequently appearing character.
yepi ca yājyādharmāstepi prathama siddheṣu yāgeṣu labdhātmāno nedaṃ kleśena labhyamānaṃ yājyātvaṃ pratīkṣante /	As for the ne cessory details laid down in connection with the Yajya, inasmuch as these are found to have acquired an existence, in connection with the previously known sacrifices, they could not stand in need of the Yajya character, which would be acquired with great difficulty.
yadi tu vikṛtirbhavettataḥ paridhikhanjevālyoriva yūpatvaṃ kāryeṇa yājyātvamadhyavasīyeta /	If the Siktavāka were a modification of the Yajyā, then its yūjyñcharacter would be as certained by its functions, just as the yüpucharacter of the Paridhi and the Khalevali.
prakṛtisviyaṃ nākāryapūrvakaṃ dharmanirūpaṇamatopi na yājyādharmāḥ /	As a matter of fact, however, it is a Primary in itself and hence the knowledge of its qualifications or accessory details could not depend upon its functions and consequently the qualifications of the Yajya could not apply to it.
tathā ca saktavāka eva yājyetyevakāra upacāraṃ dyotayatyayājyāyāṃ hi yājyopacāre satyevamupapadyate na mukhyaeva yājyātve / mukhyāyāṃ tvāitau naivakāraḥ prayuktaḥ tadāhutiḥ pāramārthikī	Thas then, in the declarationsuktavāka ēva yājyäthe word eva implies the fact of the name being applied to the Sāktavāka figuratively because the use of that word would have been possible only in case the name Yījyā were applied to something that is not Yajya, and not when it was applied to a real Yajya. For instance, in the next sentence Prastara ahutiḥthe Bhashya does not use the word eva for the simple reason that the Ahuti is real. That is to say, the word Praharaṇa does not apply to all sacrifices but it is distinctly a Homa because it consists of the actual throwing in of the offering also and not a mere offering.
ādhārādi yathā dravyacāraṇādbomatāṃ gatam /	Just as the Aghara etc, acquire the character of Homa, because of their consisting in the action of Ponring, so, in the same manner, the Praharaṇa has that character, on account of its consisting in the action of throwing in.
tathā prakṣeparūpatvāvaraṇasyāpi homatā ayājyā evaṃ nigaḍhā ṛcaiva yajatīti hi niṣiddhamapi yājyātvaṃ praśaṃsārthamihoditam	And the applicability of the name Fajya to all nigadas has been distinctly prohibited, in the declaration ayajyā eva nigadāḥ, as it is with the help of Rk mantras alone that sacrifices are performed. Though the name is thus precluded, yet the Bhäshyn applies it, by way of eulogizing the Sūktavāka, as by being connected with the Yajyä the Sūktavika becomes highly praised. Nor can the declaration be taken as meant to be a glorification of both,as in that case the glorifica tion would be wholly groundless because the basis of glorification lies in the fact of one of them being far superior to the other.
sa devatārthastatsaṃyogāt	Sūtra It serves the purpose of indicating the Deities, because of its connection with them.
yattviṣṭadevatāsaṃkīrtanena sūktavākasya kṛtārthatvānna bhūyo viniyogaḥ saṃbhavatīti tatrābhidhīyate	It has been argued above, in the Purvapaksha, that inasmuch as the Sūktavāka has its purpose duly fulfilled by the indication of the Deity, it cannot be employed over again in connection with the offering of the grassbundle. To this we make the following reply If the Direct Injunction and the Indication of the mantra words pointed to two distinct subsidiary charac ters for the Süktavāka, then alone could there be a contradiction and consequent rejection of the latter by the former.
yattvasya svasāmarthyena devatā prakāśanasādhanatvaṃ prastarapraharaṇepi viniyujyamānasya tannaivāpagacchati /	itself point to the fact of its serving the purpose of indicating the Deity, yet this indicative capability does not disappear from it, when it is em ployed in connection with the offering of the grassbundle because in this latter it is not employed in any other way than the one justified by the indications of the words.
śrutirapi ca prastara pracaraṇānabhidhāyinaṃ santamasati sāmarthya viniyoktumaśaknuvantī sāmarthyāntaraṃ cānutpādayantī yadayamabhidhātuṃ samarthaḥ kathaṃ nāma tadevābhidadhanmadarthaṃ kuryādityevamapekṣate /	The fact is that the capability of the Sukta vaka to indicate the Doity stands in need of a reconciliation with the Direct Declaration suktuvākēna prastaram praharati and this latter Declaration also, finding the Suktavāka itself making no mention of the said offering, and finding itself incapable, in the absence of such indica. tiveness of the offering, of applying it to the said offering, and yet not taking upon itself the responsibility of creating a fresh indicative potency, keeps looking out for some such way in which the Sūktavāka could be employed in the work mentioned by it, and yet not stepping beyond what is signified by the words of the mantra itself.
yadayamabhidhatte tannūnamasyāṃ kriyāyāmastīti /	Now then, as a rule, a Mantra becomes subsidiary to a sacrifice, only when it speaks of either the Action itself, or certain accessories thereof.
tasmātsūktavākenetyanayā śrutyaitatpratipādyate / yattvamabhidhatse tṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	For these reasons, we conclude that the Direct Declaration Sukta vākēna prastaram praharati addresses the mantra thus While express ing what you already do, please help in the accomplishment of the Offering of the grassbundle and the mantra replies in the following strain I will do all that I can do, while indicating the desired Deity.
tatra yadīṣṭā devatāḥ pūrvayāgasaṃbandhinya eva kevalā bhavanti tato na kiṃcitpraharaṇasya kṛtaṃ syā,datha tu nā evāsyāpyaṅgabhūtāstatastatprakāśanadvāreṇa sūktavākena prastaraḥ prahato bhavati /	And if the Deities desired were only those connected with previous sacri fices, then the mantra could not accord any help to the offering of the grass bundle if, however, these very Doities were connected with this offering also, then, by indicating these, the Sūktavāka would be according a dis tinct help to the accomplishment of the offering of the grassbundle.
na ca tāsāṃ devatātvādanyena prakāreṇopayogo vijñāyataityatrāpi devatātvamataśva prastara dravyasya haviṣvasaṃkīrtanādagnyādīnāṃ ca devatātvādyāgoyaṃ vijñāyamānī haraṇe tu juhotiriti prakṣepādhikatvādboma ityavadhāryate /	These Deities too are not known as to be employed in any other capacity, save that of serving as Deities and hence the Deities spoken of in the Sūktavāka, could not be anything other than Deities, in the said offering also. Thus then, the substance grassbundle being spoken of as an offering material, and Agni and the rest spoken of in the Sūktuvāka being Deities, the offering comes to be known as a sacrifice and it further comes to be recognized as the particular kind of sacrifice known as Homa, because it consists of the further action of Throwing in.
tasmādavirodhaḥ śrutiliṅgayoḥ /	And thus there is no contradiction between the Direct Declaration.
evaṃ ca sūcamicāpi sa devatārtha eva /	Thus then, the meaning of the sutra comes to be this In the case of the Offering also, the Sūktavāka serves the purpose of indicating the Deity because the Offering is connected with the same Deities.
tābhirasyāpi harateḥ saṃyogā kānārthatāpica pramaṅgādbhaviṣyatyeva mantrapāṭhakrameṇa sūktavākasya jñātakālatvādyadyagniridaṃ havirajuṣatetyevamāyeva yeteti /	The sense of this is that even before the declaration sūktuvākēna prastaram praharati, it is found that a portion of the Sūktu vakamantra itself is capable of connecting it with the Offering in question. Though the capability of the Mantra is equally applicable to all offering materials, yet, on the strength of the Direct Declaration in question, the sentence yadanēna havishā,etc. must be taken as refering to the Bundle of grass. Or it may be that from the very beginning, the word idam this refers to the grassbundle for the simple reason that the other materialsPurodaça and the likeare not present at the time.
yadyapi ca sādhāraṇaṃ mantrasya sāmarthya tathāpi śrutyanugrahārthaṃ prastara eva yadanena iviṣeti nirdeṣṭavyaḥ /	Because all that it does is to eulogize it, as already known to have been respected and followed accepted. Consequently there can be nothing incongruous in the Süktavāku being subsidiary to the Offering of the grassbundle. Sutra If it be urgedt hat the Action is a Pratipatti an offering of Disposal.” This sutra may be taken either as recapitulating an objection, or as actually bringing forward the objection.
ṛtha vā''dita evārabhyedaṃśabdena prastara nirdeśaḥ puroḍāśādīnāmapratyakṣatvāt /	Sūtra A Like the Svishtakṛt, it could be both Yāga and Pratipatti. We have broken up Sütra of the Bhashya into two sūtrası as this splitting has been indicated as desirable by all old teachers.
ajuṣanetyanarthakamiti cet na /	And certainly the character of the Disposuloffering is not incom patible with that of a sacrifice.
pūrvasevitaprasiddhidāreṇa stutyarthatvādata upa pannamaṅgatvam kathama pradhānakarmaṇaḥ sūktavāko 'gnyādayo vāṅgamityata u ttarasūtraṃ paṭhati	As what the sacrifice consists of is the bringing about of a certain relationship between the Deity and the Offer ing material. And when a certain action has been thus recognized as a sacrifice, then follows the consideration of the question as to whether it is a Disposaloffering or an Independent sacrifice and it comes to be taken as the former, if it is found to fulfil the conditions laid down under Sutra IVii.
kṛtsnopadeśā dubhayatra sarvavacanam	Certainly there can be no incongruity in this.
adhikāramupajīvancicārayati /	Thus it is the Independent sacrifice and the Disposaloffering that are meant by the word ubhayasaṁskāra in the sūtra.
kimubhayoīrśapūrṇamāmayoḥ sakataḥ sūktavākaḥ prayoktavyaḥ uteṣṭadevatānurodhena niṣkarṣa iti / kiṃ prāptam/	Nor is it necessary that the mantru cannot be subsidiary to a Dis posaloffering. Because such an offering is distinctly seen to serve a useful purpose and for the sake of the bringing about of the transcen dental result, proceeding from the Restriction laid down, it would certainly stand in need of certain Vedic accessories in the shape of the mantra, etc..
ekaikatra sakala iti /	Sūtra The whole is to be recited on both occasions because it is enjoined as one complete whole.
yathārtha vā śeṣabhūta saṃskārāt evamādīnāmapakarṣa ityuktaṃ stutaśastrādhikaraṇe pūṣādyanumantraṇeṣu coktam /	Reverting to the original subject of the DarçaParṇamāsa, we proceed to consider the question as to whether the whole of the Suktavāka is to be recited at the Darça as well as at the Parṇamāsa sacrifices, or portions of it are to be extracted in the case of each of these, in consideration of the Deities connected with the sacrifices and spoken of by the Mantras.
yadyetāni kevalapraharaṇāṅgabhūtāni devatānta rāṇi bhaveyustata ubhayatra sakataḥ prayujyeta /	If the Deities men tioned in the Suktavāka mantras were such as belonged to the offering of the grassbundle only, and were wholly different from those belonging to the Darça and the Pūrṇamāsu sacrifices,then in that case, the whole of it could have been recited at each of the two sacrifices.
taeva tviāpyagnyādayaḥ pratyabhijñāyantaiti na bhedaheturakhyata śveṣṭa devatāprakāśanopajīvitvādaprayojakaṃ pradaraṇaṃ sūktavākasya pradhānaprayutadevatāśrayatvātta tadadhīnaṃ vijñāyate /	As a matter of fact, however, we find that the mantras speak of the same Agnietc. recitation of the Suktavāka. For the simple reason that it is based upon the Deities that have been employed at the Primary sacrifices of the Darça and the Pūrṇamāsa, it is concluded that the Sūktavāka, as well as the offering of the grassbundle, is subservient to those Primary sacrifices.
tāni ca pradhānāni yathādevataṃ prayuñjate nāviśeṣeṇa /	Aud as for these Primary sacrifices, they are performed in connection with their respective Deities, and not equally with all the Deities of the Darça and the Purnamāsa.
tasmādapakarṣa iti vidhiryadi pradhānānāmitikartavyatāṃ prati /	Consequently, of the Sutakavaka also, it is necessary to make extracts fitting in with the sacrifice at which it is to be recited. Sūtra Objection On account of the name there could be no extracts.
ubhe prati tataḥ kṛtsnaḥ muktavāko bhavedayam	Consequently the whole name of Suktavāka would apply to these two recitations on the two occasions taken jointly.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīya pāda /	The above is the exposition of the Siddhanta, as contained in the sutra.
yāgasya phanna saṃvandhātpratyeka samavāyinaḥ /	Objection Inasmuch as the means to the Result is specified by a compound name expressive of the Combination, the Root yaji also would be taken as denoting the combined sacrifices.
samudāyaḥ phalārthaḥ syāditi kenāvagamyate bindau ca samudāye ca toyaśabdo yatheṣyate /	Consequently, even when the Root yaji occurs together with a Name, all that is meant is that the constituents are companions, and not that it is only a combination of them that can bring about the Result. Objection Thus then, just as the potency of bringing about the result belongs to the constituent parts as associated with one another, so, in the same manner, the method also, as helping the accomplishment of that Result, would pertain to them as thus combined.
saṃsargidravyarūpatvātsūktavākapadaṃ tathā	Because, just as a single class inheres in many individuals, so, in the same manner, the character of the Suktavaka, which consists in being a wellsaid saying, would inhere in every one of those recited.
tena tridhaiva mantavyaḥ saktavākaḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ /	Thus then, the Süktavāka must be taken as having three forms one that appears in the actual text of the Veda that which it has, at the time of the actual performance of sacrifices, on the occasion of the Primary sacrifices and that which it has, at the time of the perform ance of the Subsidiary sacrifices.

When recited along with the Primary ones of the Combined sacrifices, we use them as pertaining to certain Deities chosen out of the rest.

liṅgakramasamākhyānātkāmyayuktaṃ samāmnānam	Sūtra On account of the Indicative Power, the Order of sequence and the Name, the mention of the Yājyāpuronu vākyā would be in connection with the kāmya sacrifices. We find the kamya sacrifices i.e.

And in regard to these, there arises the question as to whether these Couplets, from their indicative power, are to be employed, irrespective of the order in which they are mentioned, in all the sacrifices that happen to be connected with those Deities, or they are to be employed only in the aforesaid kāmya sacrifices, in the same order in which these latter are mentioned.

na ca tatsvarūpa prayutatve phalamasti / yajña saṃbandhitā tadanuraktadevatā saṃbandhitā vā naitāvatā vākyaprakaraṇādirahitena śakyopādātum /	As against the above Púrvapaksha, we have the following arguments Unless a certain mantra is connected with a sacrifice, its Indicative Power alone cannot apply it to any sacrifice and in the case in question we find that that which connects the couplets in question with sacrifices, also distinctly shows that they belong to the said kāmya sacrifices. That is to say, all that the Indicative Power of the Mantra could do would be to connect it with a certain Deity. But no useful purpose is served by the mantra used for the sole purpose of pointing out the form of the Deity.
na ca jñāyate kāṃśe viniyoga iti /	Nor can it be known, from Indicative Power alone, in which part of the sacrifice the Mantra is to be employed.

For instance, in the case in question, the name of the complets is Yājyā, which, denoting that whereby u sacrifice is performed, distinctly connects the couplet with a Sacrifice and it also establishes the further fact of the Couplet serving the purpose of accomplishing the offering of the material.
tataśca kena yajñena saṃbandha iti liṅgāttaddevatyeneti vijñāyate /	This being done by the Name, the further question, as to the particular sacrifice with which the couplets are connected, is settled by the Indicative Power of the Couplets, which shows that they are connected with those sacrifices that are connected with the Deities indicated by the couplets.
nanvevasapīṣṭaṃ na sidhyatyeva /	Objection This does not quite prove what is desired by the Siddhānti.
kathaṃ na sidhyati / yadā kāmyaṃ yājyākāṇḍamityetāvatyā samā khyayā kāmyeṣṭiviṣayatvaṃ niyatam /	Reply How is it not proved, when the Name, Kāmyam yäjyākānḍam, distinctly restricts the application of the couplets in question to the kāmya sacrifices? And further, even if the Name merely pointed out the connection of the couplets with sacrifice in general, such universal application authorized by Name would be set aside by the stronger authority of the Order of sequence. Consequently it must be admitted that the couplets are mentioned as connected with the kamya sacrifices.

Reply What you say would have been quite right, if the couplets speaking of the Deities of the sacrifices laid down were exactly of the same number as the sacrifices themselves as a matter of fact, however, we find that, in the order of the Action, which has a Deity other than Agni, and which is filled up with a Yājyānuvākyā in keeping with its form, there are mentioned certain verses pertaining to Agni and if these were to be applied in accordance with their Name only, then they would be applied to the operation of the Yājyā in connection with other Deities than Agni.
na cāsti saṃbhavaḥ viciṅgatvādanyābhyāṃ talliṅgābhyāṃ bādhitatvāt /	As a matter of fact, however, such application of the verses is not possible because there is a diversity of the Indicative Power of the verse with the Deities other thau Agni and because the application of the verses pertaining to Agui is set aside by the other verses that are indicative of the same other Deities.
tenāviniyogaevaṅgakramāśrayaṇe punaḥ samākhyāyāṃ nivṛttavyāpārāyāṃ tābhyāṃ viniyoge sati sāmidhenīṣu prayogaḥ siddho bhavati /	When, however, we accept the Indicative Power, as also the Order of Sequence as controlling the application of mantras, then, when the Name will have ceased functioning after having pointed out the fact of the verses being connected with a sacrifice, the application of the verse would be defined by means of their Indicative Power and the Order of their sequence and thus the verses pertaining to Agni would become applied to the Samidheni.
taṃ viṣayaṃ darśayati /	The Bhashya shows a case where what is said above actually happens.
āgnivāruṇyā iṣṭeryājyāpurīnuvākye paṭhitvā saumārairaudrīṇāmiṣṭonāṃ yājyāpuronuvākyāvanāgatāsu manoṣṭacaḥ padyante /	The Yajyapuronuvakya couplets of the Agniväruni sacrifice having been mentioned,before the couplets of the Somaraudri sacrifices have been mentioned, we find mentioned the Manuverses and these latter verses become the Dhayya verses of the Samidheni.

When, however, the Order of Sequence steps in, inasmuch as it connects the verses with the sacrifice, long before the Name comes in, it controls the Indicative Power in the assumption of the corroborative text,and hence is avoided any such application as is not in keeping with the Order of Sequence.

tatra saṃdehaḥ kiṃ tayatiriktā grahītavyā uta tā vā anyā vā 'tha vā tā eveti granthāttrayaḥ pakṣāḥ pratibhānti /	And in connection with this latter Injunction, there arises the question as to whether the Agnēyi verses to be employed in the Agnidhropasthāna are those wholly apart from the former mantras ‘ Agna āyāhi,etc. or, this upasthana may be done either with those very mantras, or with others or, lastly, it is to be done with those very mantras only. That there are these three alternative views on the ques tion is shown by the text.
na tviāprakṛtā evetyasya pakṣasya pramāṇamasti /	As a matter of fact, however, there is no basis for the first of these views that the verses to be employed are those alone that are not mentioned in the Context.

And it is the absence of the qualifying api also that has led people to believe that it speaks of the application of only those that do not appear in the context.
yenāprakṛtā eveti bhrāntirbhavati /	The verses appearing in the Context having been utilized elsewhere, they will have become too stale to be used in the said upasthana.

yadi tu tatrāpi viśeṣagraiṇaṃ na syāt tatastadapyanenaiva tulyamityudāharaṇatvena gṛhyeta /	If these latter were not taken as particular Injunctions, then the two Injunctions would be equal and as such could not serve as the basis for the present Adhi karaṇa.

upadiṣṭopadeśo hi na nyāyya iti /	Says the Bhashya Upadishṭopadeço hi na nyāyyaḥ ēvanjätîyakasya.
idha upadiṣṭasyaivetyarthaḥ / evaṃjātīyakasyeti viśeṣaṇarahitasyetyarthaḥ /	The word upadishtopaděçaḥ must be taken as = upadishtasyaiva upadeçaḥ, and evanjatiyakasya as viçeshanarahitasya the sense being that when such verses without qualifications have been laid down once, it is not right for them to be laid down again.

This question emanates from the Siddhanti, and what it means is this Even in the absence of specifica tions, there is a ground for particularization, in the shape of the Context. The Siddhantis opponent saysWhy do you put this question, when application? In this the opponent brings forward an argument which, really supporting his own position, is said in a way as if it were meant by the Siddhanti as one in favour of specialization. The word Indica tive Power Linga that is used in this sentence is not in the sense of the Power of indicating the Deity, which will be spoken of later on, but in the sense of the Power of the Verbal affix, or the Power of being enjoined by that affix because the Bhashya speaks of the absence of Injunction when the potency of that Affix has been spent up.
na cātropari vacya māṇadevatāliṅgābhiprāyeṇa liṅgapadaṃ prayuktam /	Then says the Bhashya Nasau sāmānyēnu lińgēna anyatropadēça marhati.
nāsau sāmānyena sa liṅgenetyagninā cina sarvāsu pratīyamānāsa sphuṭena vi śeṣaṇena vinā na śakyo mantraviśeṣaḥ pratipattumityabhiprāyaḥ /	That is to say, the distinctive feature of the word Agni being common to all the verses, there is an idea of all these and as there is no distinct specifying feature, we can have no idea of any particular Mantra.
tadiha yadi viśeṣaṇamiṣyate tato dārśaparṇamāsika nirvāpālambhanyāyena kartavyatāvacanena liṅgena viśeṣṭavyam /	If a specifying feature be admitted, then, in accordance with the Law relating to the Nirvapalambha of the Darça Purnamasa, the specification must be done by the Indicative potency of the Verbal Affix, which speaks of the performability of the action.
tadvyakamaṅgabhūtebhyo dāśatayebhyo nivṛttamata eva viśeṣaṇaṃ tathā darśayati /	This Indicative Potency is precluded from the Dāçataya verses and as such could be admitted as specifying the particular Agneyi verses to be employed.
yenāne naivaṃ siṅgenaitatkarotīti kartavyam / yenānenaivaṃ liṅgenāgniliṅgenendraniṅgena vā kiṃ citkarotīti ākhyātṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	This specification is shown by the Bhashya, in the sentence ‘yēna anēnaivamliñgēna ētatkaroti, which means that the Agnidhropas thana is to be done by such Agneyi verses as are singled out as being enjoined by means of the verbal affix, which directs that it is to be done by such mantras as are indicative of Agni or Indra.
athopadiśyetāgneyyādinā karotīti tato na viśeṣito bhavati /	But in this case, the Injunctive word being taken up by the said specification, there would be no Injunction of any thing at all. If, on the other hand, the sentence be taken as enjoining the upasthāna to be done by the Ayneyi etc., then there would be no specification and hence we could take up any Agneyi verse at random.
tasmātkartavyatāvacanavarjjitakevalāgnyāḍhidevatopannāpāsāmarthyā tpunardāśatayā api grahītavyā iti/	Thus then, what the Siddhanta would have is the Injunction of the specified Agneyi which has already been once enjoined and this would be wholly unwarranted, and most objectionable. Thus then, through the power of the verse, to indicate the Deities, · Agni etc., apart from any mention of performability, the Dāçataya verses speaking of Agni also would come to be employed in the upasthāna “in question.
nanu prakaraṇa sāmarthyāditi siddhāntābhi prāyeṇoktam /	Question, emanating from the standpoint of the Siddhānti ‘On the strength of the Context, we could certainly admit those only that appear in the context.
liṅgaṃ prakaraṇāddalīya iti liṅga śabdenāca devatāsaṃbandhādyaugikī śrutirabhidhīyate na sāmarthyamātram/	Answer Indicative lower Linga is more authoritative than the Context. By the word Linga Indicative Power in this sentence is meant the Direct Declaration which is literally connected with the dis. tinguishing feature of the Deity, and not mere Power.
upariṣṭāt bahuprayogagatopi liṅgaśabda evameva yaugika śrutivacano vyā khyeyaḥ /	the word Linga, appearing in many places, is to be taken in this sense.

The sense of this reply is that inas much as the word Agneyi denotes all the individual Agneyi verses, the word Agneyya points to the admissibility of the Daçataya verses also consequently if, on the strength of the Context, those Âgnēyi verses alone that are mentioned in the Context should be admitted, then the Daçataya verses would be set aside, and this would lead to contradiction between the Context and the Indicative Power. The Siddhanti objectsBut the Individual is never denoted by the word Agneyi and hence the word Agneyya would not denote the indivi dual Agneyi verses.
itarastu vyaktyabhidhānābhiprāyeṇa dāśatayaprāptinivartanādvirodhaṃ samarthayate /	This objection is meant to strike at the very basis of the reply just given.
nanu vyaktirapadārtha ityabhiprāyapratyādeśaḥ /	The reply to this, however, is that we do not yet quite know if what pertains to the case in question is the generic character of having the Indicative Power in question.

If, on the other hand, the word Agneyya be taken as denoting the individual verse characterized by a mention of the deity Agni,then, if we were to restrict ourselves to those Agneyi verses alone that appear in the Context, we would be re jecting one portion of the idea arising from the Direct Denotation of the word i.e. the admissibility of the Agneyi verses not mentioned in the Context, such as the Daçataya. This would be all the more objection able, because, as a matter of fact, in the case in question i.e.
neti brūmaḥ /	But this explanation is scarcely right.
tathā sati vyaktīnāmaśrutatvādaparigrahepi doṣābhāvā, dataḥ prakṛtāpekṣayā sāmānyamapahūyata iti vaktavyam/	Because in that case the denotability of the generic entity being admitted, inasmuch as the Individual verses would not be mentioned by the sentence in question, there would be nothing incongru ous in the rejection of every one of the individual verses. Consequently we must take the Bhāshya to mean that it denies the denotability of the “generic entity, as with particular reference to the verses appearing in the Context.
vyaktiśabdo hyayaṃ yaugikatvāt na jāti mabdatvaṃ pratipadyate/ na cātra jātiḥ kā citpratīyate nānārūpāsu nānācchandaskāsvapi ca devataikatvamātreṇāgneyyā diśabdaprayogāt /	As a matter of fact, the word Agneyi is denotative of the Individual, because of its signification being based upon its etymology and as such it can never be denotative of the generic entity. In fact, in the case in question, no generic entity is cognized, because the word Agneyi applies to many verses, of various different metres, on the basis of the fact of the Deity spoken of in them being one and the same. For instance, in the two verses Agna āyāhi vitayê,etc. and Agnim “hotāram,etc. known as Āgnēyi, we do not find any common element and we find that what is invariably concomitant with the name Agnēyi, is the relationship of the Deity Agni, and nothing else not even the generic character of being a verse as the name is applicable to Actions and Substances also f. i.
na āgnaāyāhi vītayegniṃ hotāraṃ manye dākhantamityeta yodevatāvyatiriktaṃ kiṃ citmāmānyaṃ dṛśyate /	we have Agnèya puroḍāça and ··Ãgnêyî āhūti.
ato devataivātra samānetyāha /	In view of this the Bhashya has said that the only common element is the Deity.
saṃbandhasta samānaḥ sannapi nābhidheyatvenārthasidvatvādbhāṣyakāreṇopanyastaḥ /	As for this relationship of the Deity, though that too is a common element, yet the Bhashya has not men tioned it, because it is not directly expressed by the word, being only implied by it. And inasmuch as that Deity would be common to all Agneyi verses, there would be no endlessness or incongruity as has been found to be the case with the denotability of Individuals.
pūrvābhihite 'pi ca viśeṣaṇe prakṛtipratyayayoḥ śaktibhedātpratyayena viśeṣyābhidhānamaviruddham /	C And the reason for this is that, though, in the word · Āgnēyi, the qualifying Agni is the first to be denoted by the basic noun Agni. yet, inasmuch as the denotative potency of the base is distinct from that of the affix, there would be nothing incongruous in the denotation. by the affix, of the qualified verse.

In the case of the word Agneyi, on the other hand, we find that the word Agni, which denotes the qualifying Deity, is never used in the sense of the qualified verse nor is the word Agnèyi, which denotes the qualified, ever used in the sense of the qualifying Deity and hence the same word could not be extended to the qualified.
yadi ceca viśeṣaṇamātramabhidhīyeta tatastasyaiva kāryakṣamatvānnaiva viśeṣyaṃ parigṛhyeta /	If the word denoted the qualifying Deity alone, then, inasmuch as that would fulfil all the requirements of the case, there would be no reason for admitting the qualified.
tasmādyataya evātrābhidheyāḥ / taduktaṃ piṅgāccaikacāyanīśabdayoḥ /	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the word in question denotes the Individuals as we have explained above, in connection with the words Pingākshi and Ēkahayani. And hence, in certain cases. we could admit the verses mentioned in the Context also.

That is to say, the Purvapakshi himself has declared that no stale verses could be admitted.

Objectionemanating from one who cannot brook an infringement without reason, of the Context Your theory is open to the great objection, that it is not in keeping with both, the Indicative Power and the Context.
parastu devatāliṅgayuktiśrutibalīyastvamevottaraṃ dadāti /	The reply to this is that the Direct Declaration connected with the Indicativeness of the Deity is much stronger in its authority than the Context.
api ca na liṅgayogika atyātmakaṃ prakaraṇaṃ cānugrahītavyamiti lokasyātisaṃmugdhāṃ vācoyuktiṃ nirākartumupanyasyati /	Says the BhashyaAnd further, it is not necessary to follow the Indicative Power, in the shape of the literal Declaration, as well as the Context. This is meant as a general rebuff to the extremely objection able popular idea that both are to be respected.
sarvapramāṇavyavahāreṣveva na pramāṇa manugrahītuṃ puruṣāḥ prameyeṣu pravartante kiṃ tatmānam tataḥ kimiti cedata /	As a matter of fact, in the case of all authoritative means of knowledge, the Persons concerned take up the objects of cognition, not with a view to help or respect those means, but for the sole purpose of helping themselves in their knowledge of the things concerned. Question What do you mean by this ? Answer What we mean is this When the same means of cogni tion is found to be applied to a number of things, if it happens to be respected with regard to any one of these, it is taken as having its requirements fulfilled and the other things, even if of use in accom plishing certain ends of the man, would not be admitted if the mere respecting of the means of Cognition were the sole motive and further.
sakṛtprayukta vā kāmye phalabhūmārthināmapi na bhūyaḥ prayogo bhave,ttasmātpramāṇānugrahamanāhatyātmānugrahārthaṃ tatra tatra pravartitavya mitya viśeṣagrahāsāmadhyaṃm/	when a man would have performed a certain action calculated to bring about a certain desirable result the text laying down that Action will have been duly respected in this single performance, and he would not perform the Action again, even if he desired a further supply of the same desirable result. Hence, it must be admitted that we should reject the necessity of respecting the means of knowledge, and confine our selves to the helping of ourselves by the actions cognized by those means.
liṅgapratyayavirudvatvādityatrāpi liṅgaśabdasta mānneva prayukta iti draṣṭavyam/	And thus the word Agnēyi` must be admitted to be not indicative of any particular Agneyi verses. Says the Bhashya The Content is not to be followed, because it is contradictory to the idea produced by the Lingu. And in this sentence, “ the word Linga must be taken as used in the sense of the Indicative power pertaining to no particular verses.
sūtramapyataḍhā khyaprāpaṇaṃ karotīti nātadākhyamāaniyamārthamiti vyākhyeyam /	Sutra Only those mentioned in the Context are meant to be admitted, because of the Context and reasons. The word tadakhya means that which is spoken of in the Context as admissible or that which is spoken of as belonging to the sacrifice under treatment i.e.
ṛtukāryaviśeṣo'yaṃ mantrasyāsyopadiśyate / sāmānyaprāptyapekṣaśca viśeṣo nityamiṣyate	It is such a verse that is to be admitted because what the sentence Ãgnēyyāetc. lays down is a particular function that the mantra is to serve in connection with a sacrifice and as a rule the Injunction of the particular is always based. upon that of the general.
naikāntātkama saṃbandhamupapādayituṃ namaḥ anarthakacopadeśaḥ syādasaṃbandhātphalavateti	That is to say, in the sentence in question, the upasthana is not laid down as due to the form of the Agnidhra himself nor is it an independent action, leading to a certain desirable result because no such result is mentioned in connection with it hence it must be admitted that the upasthāna is performed with a view to help in the accomplishment of the Apurva resulting from the Jyotish toma sacrifice.
nanu prakaraṇājjyotiṣṭomasyopakārakaḥ syādityanyataḥ sāmānyasaṃbandhasiddhiṃ manyate /	And consequently the sentence in question comes to be taken as laying down a particular action in connection with the Jyotishtoma. The injunction of this particular action could be possible only when there was a general Action already enjoined and then if the same sentence agneyyaetc. were to lay down the connection of the Agneyi verses with the general as well as the parti cular action, then there would be a syntactical split.
yadyupasthānajyotiṣṭomasaṃbandhī vivakṣyeta tatastenaikavākyatāmiyāt /	Objection The sentence in question having laid down the particular relationship, the general would be implied by that itself.
yadā tu khannu tamavidhāyopasthānamanūdya vi śiṣṭavidhānena vā mantrasaṃbandhī vidhīyeta tadā lauki ke niṣphale śuddha evopasthāne mantraḥ prāpnoti ananumitaśrutiprakaraṇāṃ bādhitvā, na hi tadā prakaraṇādviśeṣapratyayo, matpaśtu prathamameva jyotiṣṭomena khokṛtatvānnānyatra prāptirityarthavattā lāghavaṃ ca /	And again, if the general connection with the Jyotishtoma were an invariable concomitant following on the wake of the establishment of the connection of the verse with the Agnidhra, in the same way as satisfaction follows on the wake of a hearty meal,then, in that case, there would be no necessity of calling upon a scriptural text pointing to that connection. As a matter of fact, however, we find that the general connection with the Jyotishtoma appears long before that with the Agnidhra because this latter being a mere substance, no results are to follow from a connection of the verse with this. And hence, inasmuch as that general connection would not be possible without a scriptural text, the trouble of having to assume a nonexisting text would remain as before. Then again, inasmuch as the connection spoken of in the sentence in question is capable of being met with in the matter of ordinary worldly actiops also, it could not necessarily connect the verse with the sacrifice Jyotistoma.
thavā''gnādīnāṃ karmāṅgabhūtānāṃ mantrāṇāṃ ca karānāṃ saṃbandhaṃ vidhīyamāne upasthānamapyanūdyataiti laghutaram	Agnihotram juhuyāt svargakāmaḥ are taken, not as implying an in junction of the said Kindling of Fire, but as merely laying down those sacrifices for those who have duly performed the said Kindling so, in the same manner, what the sentence in question means is that in the upās thana in question, only those Agneyi verses are to be employed, that have been connected with the Jyotish toma.
yadyapyahammaca ku pratyayena viśeṣaṇam /	And this diversity would lead to a syntactical split.
tathāpi naiva mucyeyaṃ sarvāsāṃ grahaṇādi	And if we admit only those that are mentioned in the Context, then we are saved from all the said undesirable contingencies.
ato naivedamāśakyamā khyātena viśeṣaṇam /	And in this, there is a further advantage,viz. that on account of the proximity of the Injunctive affix with the verses mentioned in the same Context, it does not become necessary to carry that affix very far from its context.
sarvapratyaya eva syātkṛtepi hi viśeṣaṇe	Objection In the Context also there is no such general connection mentioned, as is wanted and even if it were there, inasmuch as it would point to the verses being employed in other purposes, the utilizing of it in the Upasthāna in question would be most incompatible.
laukikaṃ vaidikaṃ vāpi pramāṇaṃ doṣavarjitam /	Objection In that case, the assertion of the general connection would become incompatible with what you say.
sarvamāśrīyate khārthe na cāsmindoṣasaṃbhavaḥ tasya rūpopadeśābhyāmapakarpo 'rthasya coditvāt	Reply Why should it be incompatible, when, as a matter of fact, the general is involved in all particulars? Consequently what we would do in the case in question would be to leave off the specialities of the general connection as laid down in connection with the Jyotishtoma, which could be of no use in the case of other particulars, and to accept only the general feature of that connection, which has been established, through thoso specialities and there would be no incongruity in this.
paricodanoktenaiva mārgeṇāpakarṣaḥ kartavyaḥ śrutiprādhānyānugrahāt / grahaṇādivacca rūpeṇa sāmarthyātprakaraṇena liṅgena vākyasya bādhitatvāt / nanu bhaṇaikavākyatvamapi liṅgakatameva /	even the sentence Somēna yajeta could be construed only asYagam kuryāt, tacca somena. Nor is the qualified Injunction in question known as a whit less important than the other qualified Injunctions,as, equally with the rest, it lays down something quite new. Specially as, in accordance with the Siddhanta also, inasmuch as no other indicative power save that pertaining to the Deity is admitted, the addition of tacca evam lingënais as necessary as in accordance with the Purvapakšha as even the verse mentioned in the Context could not apply to the Upasthana, if it had not that Indicative Power.
satyam /	If the sentence meant.
tathāpi śrutiviprakarṣāt daurbalyam /	accomplishment of the Result of that sacrifice and further, this way of interpreting the sentence is very much simpler.
grahaṇāṃdyabhidhānasāmarthyena hi śrutimanumāya śīghraṃ viniyogaḥ kriyate itareṇatantravārtika /	Though it is a fact that the Holdingetc. do not abandon their predominance, and are directly expressed by the words of the mantras,and as such the mantras should be taken as pointing to these,yet, inasmuch as no useful purpose would be served by pointing to that which has not been enjoined, it is more reasonable to take them as concomitant auxiliaries to that which is enjoined i.e. the Eating as we have explained in connection with the Nirvapa Mantra.
punarekavākyatā /	There is yet another argument in favour of our viewviz.
tato lakṣaṇādvāreṇa bhakṣaṃ prati sāmarthyaṃ tataḥ śrutyanumānamiti viprakarṣaḥ /	Con sequently the mere fact of the Anuvāka being recognized as called by the name Bhakshanuvāka must be accepted as sufficient authority for the correctness of the name it is for this reason that whenever we come across this particular Auuvāka, the name ‘Bhakshānuvāka always comes up to our mind and the compound Bhakshanuvāka being ex pounded as bhakshasya anuvākaḥ, distinctly points to the fact of the Anüvāka being connected with Eating.
tena bhakṣasya pratyāsannavareṇa ma ntrādinā varuḍatvāḍhateṣāmapi ca svayamanyatrāpravṛtterapakarṣaḥ /	And thus whenever these two the Anuvaka and the Eating present themselves to our mind, it becomes at once apparent that they bear some sort of a mutual relation ship and it is this general relationship that becomes specified by their mutual requirements.
nanvarthaprāptānāṃ prakāśanaṃ niṣprayojanam /	The disjunction of the mantras is to be explained in the manner indicated in the first objection against the Purvapaksha that is to say.
kathaṃ niṣprayojanam yadā tānyapyaprakāśitāni naiva śakyante'nuṣṭhātum /	Objection There is not much useful purpose served by a mantra pointing to those that are already implied by something else. Reply How can such pointing out be said to be useless, when we find that, unless the actions are so pointed out, they cannot be performed.
tannāmārthaprāptaṃ na prakāṇyate yadevameva vinā prayatnena niṣpadyate /	It is only such an implied action as is not pointed out, which requires `no further effort for its performance than what is made in connection with the Action that implies it.
grahaṇādīni tu sarvāṇi pṛthak prayatna sādhyāni tāni amṛtāni na śakyante kartumityavaśyaṃ smartavyāni bhatavidhirapi tānyacodayitvā na śaknoti svārthamanuṣṭhāpayitumiti tānyapi codayati /	In the case in question, however, we find that each of the actions of Holdingetc. requires an independent effort for its performance and as such until each is recalled to the mind at the time of the sacrificial performance, it cannot be performed and conse quently it becomes necessary for these to be recalled and this recalling can be done only by means of mantras .
to mantrasvarūpātteṣāṃ copadeśātsamyagjaraṇatanmantrayoścopadeśādevāpakarṣo 'rthasyaiva coditatvāttena yadyapyanudāhṛtatvāpratyakṣopadeśotra na śakyo vaktuṃ tathāpyadoṣaḥ /	the sentence abhishutya hutvä etc., etc.,is incapable of bringing about a due performance of its own object, unless it also lays down the other actions of Holdingetc. and hence it lays down these also. Thus then, on account of the peculiar form of the Mantras themselves, and of the fact of the injunction of these actions just pointed out,the Actions themselves are laid down as connected with the Mantras the Proper Digestion and the mantra connected with it being separated from the rest through a distinct Injunction shown below and hence even though the direct Injunction of such connection, being not perceived, cannot be distinctly pointed out, yet that does not much affect the position.
samyagjaraṇaṃ tu vamanavirecanayoḥ prāyaścittāmnānātpratyakṣopadiṣṭameva draṣṭavyam	As for the Proper Digestion, it must be taken as directly enjoined, on account of certain expiatory rites laid down as consequent upon Vomitting or Purging which follow only when there is no Proper Digestion.
punarabhyunīteṣu sarveṣāmupalakṣaṇaṃ dviśeṣatvāt	. Sutra The portion beginning with mandra is to be taken as a single mantra, because it speaks of a subsidiary detail specially as the two sentences therein contained jointly express a single fact.
evaṃ pūrvapanasthaevādhikaraṇe kṛtvā cintayo' viṣayatvaṃ cinta yati /	Inasmuch as, like Holdingetc. To this we make the following reply That Action alone can form the object of Indication by mantras, which requires a distinct effort for its accomplishment, and not those that merely follow on the wake of other actions.
teṣāṃ tu yathāpunarabhyunītatvaṃ yathā cohacintāviṣayatā tathā vibhajya darśayati / santi daśa camasāsteṣāṃ ye sadhyataḥkāriṇāṃ brahmādīnāṃ catvārastaiturvaṣaṭkārānuvaṣaṭkārayohiṃḍita hotrakacamasaistu sakṛdaṣaṭkāraeva hutaṃ sarveṣu cendro devatā / tataścamaseṣu saśeṣeṣveva somobhyunnīya hūyate /	Sutra Inasmuch as the mantra indicates the particular Eating, out of a number of those that are all enjoined by the same Injunction,the Eating of the Soma other thần that dedicated to Indra is to be done without any mantra. Inasmuch as the word Indrapitasya in the munțra is coextensive with the Soma that is offered to Indra,as there are no words in the mantra indicative of those not dedicated to Indra,and lastly, as there can be no modifications in mantras connected with the Primary Actions, and every one of the eatings is a distinct Primary by itself, it would appear that the eating of the Soma dedicated to other Deities is to be done without mantrus.
tatra dvitīya home chotrakā nānādevatā yajati maitrāvaruṇo mitrāvaruṇā mitraṃ vayaṃ havāmahaityādiyājyābhireva darśayati /	Sutra The mantra will have to be applied in accordance with the Deity to whom the offering has been made because the offerings to the other Deities are shown to have their archetype in the offering made to Indra. In connection with the eating of the Soma dedicated to other Deities than Indra, the mantra is to be repeated with the necessary modifications because the offerings to the other Deities are mere ectypes of the offering to Indra.
śeṣau dṛśyete /	Though all the offerings are similar actions, yet inasmuch as they are distinct actions, some would be mere offshoots of the other.
pūrva homaśeṣaścaindra uttaraśca mitrāvaruṇādidevatyaḥ tatṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	And here we find that the offering of the Dhruvusoma to Indra forms the archetype of the other offerings.
kiṃ devatāntarasaṃcāreṇa parvadevatāsaṃbandho 'panītaḥ uta neti / yadyapanītastataḥ kevala mitrāvaruṇādyupalakṣaṇam /	are restricted by the Ahavaniya Fireetc. As a matter of fact, too, all the accessory details of the Soma are present only where the Soma is present and hence it is only the offerings of Soma to Indra that are accompanied by the acces sory details and the other offerings, not being directly connected with those details, would take them only by transference from the former.
athānapanītastata indropyupalakṣaṇīya iti /	And thus it is established that the same Mantras, with necessary modifications, are applicable to the other offerings also.
sidvāntenaiva tāvaduprakramaḥ sarveṣāmupacavaṇaṃ dviśeṣatvāditi	k It is only thus that we have the Injunction, with reference to the previously mentioned ‘namati =vipariņamati, modifies, specified to the Anushtup metre that is to say, this injunction distinctly points to the fact of the modifications of mantras being quite in keeping with the Scriptures.
śāstracakṣaṇo hi devatāsaṃbandhaḥ śāstreṇaiva grahaṇavelāyāṃ devatārthatvaṃ prakramyate / yacca prakramyate tadeva samāpyate nānyat / ica ca vacanātmaśeṣeṣu camaseṣvanyaduttaradevatārthaṃ dravyaṃ grahīta vyamiti gamyate /	This injunction is in connection with the Jyotishṭoma and it is because the various parts of the Jyotishtoma are not yet recognized its offshoots that the change in the mantra has to depend upon the said Injunction as if they were recognized as its offshoots, then the changes would have been made in accordance with the general law that the ectypes are to be done in the manner of the archetype and hence in that case the Injunction brought forward could not have shown what it is meant to show.
tatra camamopalacaṇatvenopapannaḥ śeṣaḥ /	as Objection The parts of the Jyotishṭoma are its mere ectyes and hence the mention of the change does not indicate what you mean.
yadā ca grahaṇavennāyāmasya devatārthatvaṃ nāvadhūtaṃ tadā pradānavelāyāṃ yathāgṛhīta homātmannihitopya sāvasaṃkalpitatvānna devatārthā bhavati / na vāsya tadānīṃ saṃkalpāntaramasti vacanāmāvāt /	Reply Not so because all the offerings ending with the Agnish toma being contained in the same Injunction, even though the Parts sansthas were mere ectypes, the mantra applied to these would be in its unchanged formin accordance with general law that the ectype is to be done in the same way as the archetype and in that case there should not have been any mention of Change in the word ‘namati. When the offering to Indra forms the archetype of the other offer “ings, the mantra does undergo changes, in connection with the Aynishtoma etc., occurring in the Third Savana and hence the mention of Change becomes quite compatible with this.
vibhaktavelāyāṃ saṃkalpitatvāt /	Sutra In connection with the Punarabhyunnita, there should be a mention of all Deities, because it contains the remnants of both.
na ca pradānakāne punaḥ saṃkalpāntaramasti / satsaṃkalpitasya punaḥ saṃkalpayitumaśakyatvāt /	When the soma contained in certain vessels has been offered and poured out, even while there may be some remnants left in them, more soma is poured into the same vessels for other offerings and the soma thus poured in is called the Punarabhyunnīta Soma.
na hokameva dravyamasakṛttyajyate / tasmānna pradānakāle saṃkalpostīti / yadyapi tāvaddevatā pratyakṣaṃ bhuñjīta tathāpi haṃsa ivodakāttīraṃ paścāttanameva sā somaṃ vivicya bhañjīta kimato ddeśamātropakāriṇī devatā punarabhyunnītasyaivohigyate na pūrvaśeṣasya / tena punarabhyunnīte dīyamāne pūrvaśeṣaḥ kevalamutsṛjyate na tu dīyate / yastu bhacaṇavelāyāṃ tadekadeśaḥ kaścitmo 'panītendrasaṃbandhitvāt tathaivopanāyitavya iti /	How this character belongs to that soma, and how it forms the object of the discussion rela ting to modifications, is thus shownThere are ten vessels four of these belong to the Brahma, etc., who make the middle offerings and each of these four is used twice in the offerings of Vashaṭkāra and the Anuvashatkāra of the Hotṛ priest while the Hautraka vessels that is the vessels belonging to the Holy are used only once in the offering of the Vashatkāra in all these, the Deity is Indra and while these vessels still contain remnants of the previously offered soma, more soma is poured into them and offered to other Deities all this is shown by the Directions, in connection with the offerings to many Deities that are made by the Priests in connection with the Second Homa,implied in the yajyā mantras connected with those offerings such, for instance, as maitrāvaruņo mitrāvaruņau mitram vayam havāmahe, etc.,etc. and when, after all these offerings have been made, the vessels are brought out for the purpose of the postsacrificial eating, then they are found to contain two remnants,the former, the remnant of the first offering to Indra, and the latter, that of the offering to Miträvaruņa.
pālīvate tu pūrvavat	Sūtra In the Pätnivata, it would be as before.
pūrvāpavādārthamārambhaḥ/	We proceed to consider exceptions to the general rule arrived at in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa.
dvidevatyānāmaindravāyavādīnāṃ śeṣā āditvasthāyāṃ niściṣyante tatopi punarāgrayaṇasthā lyāmāgacchanti / tataśca pātnīvatagrahaṇaṃ śrūyate upaśapātreṇa pātnīvatamāgrayaṇāt gṛhṇātīti /	As a matter of fact, we find that the remnants of the offerings to the pair of Deities are thrown into the Adityasthālī, and from that they are again transferred to the Agrayanasthilī and, subsequent to this, we have the declaration of the Holding of the Patnivata in the sentence Upançu pātrēņa Pātnivatamāyrayaṇāt gṛhṇāti. And when the eating of the remuant of this Pānivata offering comes to be done, there arises the question as to whether the Deities other than Patnivat should be mentioned in the mantra recited, or not. Sūtra Inasmuch as the remnant iš taken up by the subse quent Deity, the connection of the previous Deity should be set aside.
tasya utaśeṣe bhakṣyamāṇe pūrvavadevendravāyupatnīvatpītasyevamādyupatakṣaṇaṃ kartavyamiti pūrvapaścaḥ	The present case is by no means similar to that dealt with in the previous Adhikarana. Because, at the time of the Holding of the offering to Patnivat, the proximity of the other Deity is set aside as the offering to Patnivat is laid down as to be conveyed together with the remnants of the previous offerings.
āgrayaṇaprāpteṣu hi dvidevatyeṣu patnīvatsaṃkalpaścodyate /	That is to say, the conveying of the gift to Patnīvat is laid down, as to be done when the remnants of the offerings to the pair of Deities have been transferred to the Agrayana vessel.
vidhau hi kevaḥ patnavāndevatā nānyamahatastatenā mau codyate na ca tadvitonyasāpekṣā dutpadyate/	And under the circumstances, even if the gift were conveyed to another Deity, the implication of its connection with Patnivat would be unobstructed and when Patnivat itself is declared as one to whom the gift is to be conveyed, its connection with the remnants becomes all the more potent.
itarayā pāḍhatvenaiva tākīdṛśaṃ devatābhidhānaṃ devatāyā uddeśatṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	For instance, the soma that issues from the Agrayana vessel is meant to belong to Patnivat and as a matter of fact, the remnants of the other offerings are actually found to issue from the Agrayana vessels hence these remnants also are con veyed as gifts to Patnivat.
mātropakāritvāt / kiṃ punaryadā tatrāpi sāhityamā śrava tvanamutprekṣā na cāsāvaikāntikī, vināpi kāryayogitvena sahaśabdaprayogāt /	If we had the declaration in the form Agrayaṇam pātnīvatam karoti, then, even though the Remuant would have been proximately connected with Patnivat, yet inasmuch as it would not be the Agrayaṇa, it would on the strength of the text be removed from the conveyance of the gift. But we find the direction in the form, Ayrayaṇāt pātnīvatum gṛhṇāti, and not as Āyrayaṇusyu or Ayrayanam.
tadyathā /	And in such casese.g.
sacaiva daśabhiḥ putrairbhāraṃ vahati gardabhī / tatra hotāvānevārtho vijñāyate satsvapi daśasu putreṣu saiva vahatīti /	in the sentence vrkshāt parṇam patatiwe understand the parna falling to be, not only the leaves of the tree, but also the feathers of the birds inhabiting the tree because the Tree is spoken of only as the place from which the parna falls and not as that to which the parna belongs.
tasmānna tvaṣṭurdevatātvamavagamyate /	In the same manner, in the case in question, all that is laid down as the ground for the connection of the Remnant with Patnivat is the fact of its issuing from the Agrayaṇa vessel, and not that of its being the Agrayana itself.
to nopala cayitavyaḥ kutaḥ /	Consequently, inasmuch as there would be nothing to warrant the restriction that.
coditārthānurodhena mantraḥ sarvaḥ pravartate /	And as this would be applicable to the Sampūta also, it becomes quite possible for the Remnant to be connected with the Putnivat Deity.
tena tvaṣṭravadevātra triṃśatāgnerabhiṣṭutiḥ / pātnovatacodanārtha smaraṇahetunā mantreṇa na śakyamacoditamagneḥ pariveṣṭutvamitareṣāṃ ca bhoktṛtvaṃ prakāśayitum /	And as until the ownership of the previous Deity has not been set aside, it could not belong to the previous Deity, there can be no mention of the previous Deity at the eating of the Rem nant of the Pätnivata just as when the teacher gives the remnant of his food to his headpupil, and this latter, having had his full out of it, gives it to the subordinate pupil, this latter eats it as the remnant of the food of the headpupil, and not as that of the teacher. The author of the Bhashya, thinking of making the objector admit his own view of the case, replies jointly Certainly, we do not find any part of that which has been poured into the fire as an offering.
ato mantrasya parārthatvānna codanāmatikramya svātantryeṇa trayastriṃśa prakāśana sāmarthyamavakalpate/	That is to say, all that belongs to the previous Deity is that which was actually poured for it into the fire, and that which was thus offered was destroyed by...
vidhānasāmathrthyaṃ tu dūrabhraṣṭameva /	the fire.
na ca triṃśato devatātvameva smārayati coditāgnyaiśvaryaprakāśanaparatvena trayastriṃśatprakīrtanāt	The opponent, not comprehending the drift of the answer, urges Even in the original offering, we do not find any portion of that which has been poured as libation. The answer to this is that, in the original offering the Deity was dnly named at the time of the utterance of the words conveying the gift to the Deity.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	The Siddhanti replies In this lies the difference from the original offering.
yadi hyaprattāvasthameva dravyatvaṃ dehoti mukhyamevocyate tataḥ pratāraṇameva syāt /	That is to say, in the case of the original offering, there was no mention made of the Deity that had been set aside while in the present case, the fact of its having been set asido is distinctly stated.
ata āpatnīvāṃścāgniriha gṛhyate /	Thus, then, it is established that Patnīvut alone should be men tioned the mantra being read as Patnivatpitasya, etc..
satyamasti /	Sutra Such should not be the case, because of inequality.
tathāpyatrāgniḥ patnīvān gṛhyate / tadvitanirdeśena hi prātipadikārthasya saṃkhyāviśeṣābhivyaktirbhavati / tatra prātipadikārthānanyathāsaṃbhavādekavacanāntena vigrado bhavati / patnīvāndevatāsyeti /	Toashtr should not be mentioned because between Mantra and the Direct Injunction, there is a vast difference of authoritative strength this is one inequality and then again, there is a difference in the characters of Toashtr and Patnivat as nominatives to the action of Drinking as what the Mantra denotes is the mere companionship of Tvashtr this is another inequality . That is to say, in the Injunction of the Patnīvata offeringPatni vatam grhṇātiwe have Patnivat alone mentioned as the Deity, and that too by means of a nominal affix in the word Pātnīvutam and the nom inal affix could not denote this, if the deific character depended upon something else the association of another Deity for instance and for this reason also, the Indication by the words of the Mantra of the deific character of Toushtr is extremely weak in its authority as against the direct denotation of the Nominal Affix.
triṃśaca nityaṃ bahuvacanāntaḥ /	Nor is the mention of Trashtr in the Mantra otherwise inexplicable as its mention could be taken to be in praise of Patnivat.
tasmānna tebhyastahita iti devatātvābhāva iti yathā paścāttanaḥ pātā pūrvapātrupalakṣaṇam /	Thus then, the meaning of the Mantra would come to be this You, and Patnivan, who are associated with Tvashtr, drink the soma! On the other hand, how could the mention of Tvashtr being the drinker of soma even if the Mantra could be made to give this meaning make Him the Deity of that offering? Because the sole function of the Deity of a sacrifice lies in his serving as the agent with reference to whom the offerings are made and not in his actually eating or drinking the materials offered.
tantravārtika /	Sutra So also the Thirty, as the Mantra serves another purpose.
chandaḥpratiṣedhastu sarvagāmitvā t sthitāduttaram /	This Adhikaraṇa simply deals with the applicability of the conclusion of the foregoing Adhikarunu to another case.
na yathādevatamūhaḥ kiṃ tarhyanendrāṇāmamantrakameveti yadi hyabhyāsāḥ pṛthakkarmāṇi bhaveyustataḥ prakṛtivikā rabhāvaḥ syānna tvevamasti /	Inasmuch as there are several points in which the present case differs “from that dealt with in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa, the conclusion thereof is, for this reason, not applicable to the present case. These points of difference are the following The same mantra that indicates Agni to be the Deity, also in dicates the fact of Agni being the Distributer of the Drink to the Thirty and Three gods, who are spoken of as the partakers of that Drink and hence the fact of these latter also being the principal Deities is shown by the Mantra itself, which presents Agni in quite a secondary position of that of Distributer or Attendant at meals.
yena tu prakāreṇaiko gṛhṇāti tena sarve / yathā vakṣyati tadatmavanāntare grahāmnānamiti / na ca mantravaśenaindraviṣayatā somasya /	In the case of the mantra treated of in the previous Adhikarana, we found that it denoted mere companionship, and hence Tvashtr not being found to be mentioned on terms of equality, was rejected from the deific position. The case is reversed in the mantra now under consideration as in this it is Agni that is spoken of as subordinate and hence the former law cannot apply to the present case.
na ca yathā 'nāramyavādenāivanīyaḥ sarvahomārtha iti tadrahita karmāntarābhāvādanā hitāgneradhikāraḥ evamiha mantraḥ sarvasomārthaḥ /	to be as concomitant with Agniin the mantra ‘Agnãi Patnivan as with the thirty and three gods, who are also spoken of in the same Mantra as having wives in the sentence Patnivatastrimçatastrimçca “ dēvān.” Nor does the original Injunction Pātnivatam gṛhṇīyat pre clude the connection of other Deities, which preclusion would have vetoed the indications by the mantra.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda /	Nor is there any infringement of the Injunction involved in the acceptance of the other Deities the thirty and three along with the one formerly enjoined.
tatprabhṛtaye devatāsamudāyāyetyarthaḥ / atha vā vidhiśabde vasumattvasyābhāvāttaka prakāśanaṃ vyarthamiti vasumattveneta radevatāsahitāyetyetadabhidhīyate /	And inasmuch as the connection of these other deities is cognized by altogether different means i.e. the indications of the mantra, it cannot be said to have anything to do with the nominal affix in Pātnīvatum , which therefore cannot be said to be dependent upon the mention of these and as such impossible. That is to say, if the nominal affix had enjoined the Deity Patnivat, as depending upon the Thirty and thrée, then alone could it be open to the charge of standing in need of an extraneous factor. And as for the mantra, there is nothing incongruous in its indicating the Deity, as depending upon the previous Injunction as such dependence is declared to be.
tataśca vikāratvābhāvaḥ /	incompatible only with the nature of the Nominal Affix.
yattvanuṣṭupchandaso vināma vi dhānādikkṛtitvamiti tatmamānavidhānatvepi tṛtīyasavanatvājjagacchandastve prāpte viśiṣṭavidhānatvenopapatyate /	Theu too, inasmuch as we accept bothAgni as well as the Thirty and Three godsto be the Deities, there can be no contradiction between the original Injunction and the latter mantris Indication. Question When both the Deities serve the same purpose, how can they be both accepted ? as in such cases, it is necessary to take the two as optional alternatives].
na devatātvamindrasya tatpītatvena kathyate / tena nāgneyatulyatvamasāmarthyādiheṣyate	Answer Both could not be taken together, if the mantra did not speak of both. As a matter of fact, however, we find that, while not abandoning the mention of Agui, who has been enjoined in the previous Injunction,as having the character of the Deity in the shape of the Distributer, the muntra indicates the fact of the Thirty and three gods being the Deities.
ekasminbā devatāntarādvibhāgavat satyaṃ yadi devatāvyāpāraḥ pātṛtvamiha viśeṣaṇaṃ syāt / tata aindrāgnopi gṛhyeta /	And that this is authorized by the mantra itself, the Bhashya proceeds to show by appending an explanation of the mantra as follows In reciting the Yajya the Agnidhra Priest thus respectfully prefers a request to Agni, in the wordsAyahi, Comethough the a appears at the very beginning of the mantra and yähi after three words, yet such usage is in accordance with the rule Ohandasi vyavahitaçca ebhihi.e, along with the Thirty and Three gods mentioned later on, either on the same chariot, or on different chariots, as you are exception.
na tvasmākaṃ devatā pibati /	To the above we make the following reply There should be no mention of the Thirty and Three gods at the eating of the Patnīvatu Remnant.
tasmādāgneyacatukaraṇavadeva kevalendra devatyaviṣayatvānnaiva vyapadeśa ubhayadevatyaḥ saṃbhavatīti mantranivṛttiranenaiva ca viśeṣeṇāsyāpunaruktatvam / yat pūrvapakṣavādī na devatātvaminha viśeṣaṇaṃ kiṃ tarhi saṃpradānagataṃ pāttṛtvaṃ tacca pratyekamapyastīti manyate /	Because in all cases the functioning of the mantra iş cou trolled by what is directly enjoined consequently, as in the case of Tvushtr, so in the present case also, the mention of the Thirty and Three gods in the mantra must be taken as contributing to the praise of Agni. That is to say, inasmuch as the sole business of the mantra lies in recalling to mind what has been previously enjoined in the Injunction Patnīvatam grhṇāti, it could not, in any case, serve the purpose of indicating either the fact of Agni being the Distributor, or that of the Thirty and Three gods being the partakers, of the Drink, both of these facts not having been previously enjoined. Thus then, the mantru being found to serve a distinct purpose, it cannot be endowed with the power of independently indicating the deific character of the Thirty and Three gods, thereby stepping beyond the original Injunction.
yadyapi ca mukhyaṃ pātṛtvaṃ devatāyāṃ bhavettathāpi dravyasya tatpītatvamaśakyaṃ vaktum /	And when even this indicative potency is not. possible, it is all the more improbable for the mantra to have the injune tive potency. Nor could the mantra be taken as recalling the deific character of these thirty and three gods only because these gods have been men tioned simply for the purpose of indicating the greatness of Ayni, enjoined by the previous Injunction.
camasastho hi indrapītatvena vyapadiśyate / na cāsāvindrapītaḥ ita viṣayatvādindra pītavyapadeśasya /	And the reason why we take it this way is that, inasmuch as the mantra describes, as the giver, one Agni whose lordship over the Soma is unknown, such description cannot be taken in its direct sense and hence it is taken as implying the said lordship of Agui. That is to say, as a matter of fact, the Soma has not been offered to Agni at the time that the mantra is being recited and then before he has himself received the Soma, if he were really asked to give it to others, it would mean a pure deception.
tasmādavaṇya vidyamānadharmābhidhānādindrāya saṃkalpita indrapītaḥ pratyetavyaḥ /	And in this case the sentence comes to serve a dis tinctly useful purpose, in keeping with the previous Injunction. And the word madayasva satisfy them also, not being found to be com patible in its direct signification, is to be taken as implying the request come with these.
tataścāpanaṃ devatātvamevopacakṣaṇamiti / na ca itasomagataṃ pītatvaṃ tṛtīyādhyāyasya dvitīyaḥ pāda / tatropacarituṃ śakyam/	And thus, that which is clearly expressed by the nominal affix in Patnīvatam would not have to be rejected, in view of the Mantra as the two would in this case be quite compatible. Question The injunction mentioning merely the word Pâtnivatam how do you make it out to be an injunction of Agni alone as the Deity, and not the Thirty and Three? Answer In the injunction in question, what is taken as the Patnivat having a wife is Agni, and not the Thirty and Three gods because in the mantra Agnāi patnīvān we find the epithet Patnīvän applied to Agni.
ātmadharmeṇaiva saṃkalpenābhidhānopapatteḥ /	Because as a rule, when something is mentioned by means of a nominal affix as in Patnīvatam, there is no manifestation of the number of that which is denoted by the basic noun and inasmuch as the denotation of the basic noun could not be inserted in any other way, in au explanation of the word Patnīvata, it is spoken of in the singular number,as Patnīvān dēvatā asya.
ekadeśepi hi hūyamāne sarvamidaṃ dravyaṃ devatoddeśena tyajyamāna yāgaṃ sādhayati /	Sūtra As the Soma belongs equally to all the Deities, there can be no relationship of the Archetype and Ectype among the various offerings and as for the declaration of the change into the Anushtup metre it is a mere prohibition of the use of the preceding metre..
atosa/	We now proceed to offer our reply to the opponents arguments contained in Sutra .
nirvapateriva yajirevātra pibaterarthaḥ /	Because the whole nction of the Jyotishtomu forms a single context and as such an action could not be its owp archetype Prakrti and ectype Vikrti.
te naindra yāga sādhanādindra pīta pratyaya sāmarthyānmantra nivṛttiḥ	ing to Indra and that the Soma bolonging to the other Deities would be held and measured by handfuls, without being indicated by the Mantra.
sarveṣu vābhāvādekacchandasaḥ	Or, it may be that there being no discrimination among the several Somas, all of them being held up, they would be distinguished by the words conveying the offerings to the several Deities.
yatra nāmopapadyeta nirapekṣaṃ viśeṣaṇam /	It has been argued above under Sutra that, inasmuch as we have an injunction as to changing the metre of the original into the Anushtup, the offering, in connection with which this change is laid down, is an ectype of the former.
sāpekṣasyāgrahastatra na tu yatrāpi nāsti tat sarveṣāṃ vaikamantraya maitiśāyanasya bha ktipānatvātsavanādhikārī hi	Because the declara tion of Indra being the Deity does not depend upon the fact of the Soma being drunk by him and hence there can be no similarity between the present cases and the case of the Quartering of the Agneya Cake denlt with under Sutrq IIi for the simple reason of the incapability of the word.
sthitāduttara, manindrapīteṣvapi avikṛta eva mantraḥ prayoktavyo nāmantrakaṃ bhakṣaṇam /	And as the character of being drunk by Indra does not exactly exist in the Remnant that is before us at the time of Eating, we must take the word Indrapîtasya in the Mantra as applying to it, through that portion of it which has been poured in libation and there is no such limit to this as that it is only when so much has been drunk of it that it can be called by the name.
kunaḥ /	Sutra The metre is like the Deity.
indre yasminsavane pītaḥ somo nirūpyate /	The present Adhikaraṇa deals with an exception to the conclusion arrived at in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa.
tasya yonyopi saṃbandhī sa evaṃ vyapadiśyate śrīrāmacandrāya namaḥ / śrīgaṇeśāya namaḥ /	Consequently, the name gayatracchandasaḥ must be taken as applying to those in which there are many metres used just as the name Rathantarasama is applied to offerings wherein there are many other sāmas also. Thus then, it must be admitted that the mantra in question is applicable to those offerings, in connection with which there are many metres used besides the Gayatri.
śrutejatādhikāra syāt	This sutra supplies the final reply to all that has been said in Sutras .
evaṃ liṅgaviniyogamupavarṇya saṃprati vākyaviniyogaḥ prastūyate /	Thus then, the word Prātaḥsavanasya being taken as coextensive with Indrapitasya, the genitive in these two words is due to their differentia tion from all connection with Soma and that in somasya, being non Ceextensive, is based upon the nondifferentiation from the Soma. Thus then, on account of the indication of another word savanasya, X.
tatrodāharaṇam /	And certainly this would be highly objectionable.
uccairṛcā kriyate ityādi vākyam / ta dyadi ṛkta ulbaṇaṃ kriyate gāīpatyaṃ paretya bhūḥ svāheti juddhayādyadi yajuṣṭo yadi sāmata ityādi ca /	Sutra Because of the Direct Declaration, the properties would pertain to the community. Having dealt with the applicability of mantras based on their Indicative Power, we now proceed to take that based upon syntactical connection. The sentences taken up for consideration are uccairṛcã kṛyatē the Rik is recited loudly, etc., and also ‘Tadyadi ṛkta ulvanamkriyatē Garha patyam parëtya bhuḥ svahēti juhuyat if we should make a mistake in the Rk he should offer a libation into the Garhapatya Fire with the mantra bhiḥ svahä, and so forth.

Question Why should there be any such doubt as to the significa tion of the word? Answer The reason for the doubt lies in the fact of there being a disagreement between the declaration in the beginning, and that in the end, of what forms a single sentence syntactically connected.
upakrame hi vedāḥ śrūyante / upasaṃhāre tu ṛgādijātāni /	That is to say, in the beginning we have the mention of the Vedas, while in the end we find the Rk, Sama and Yajush mentioned.
tatra yadi vopakramasthavedapadamavayavabhūtajātacakṣaṇārtham atha vopasaṃcāra sthamṛgādijātaṃ sabrāhmaṇa ka samudāyanna kṣaṇārthamiti samañjasā samaja sayoḥ saṃdehaḥ sa cāktāḥ śarkarā itivadācepaparihārābhyāṃ samarthanīyaḥ /	Under the circumstances the word Veda, found in the beginning of the sentence, may be taken as indirectly indicating the Rk, etc., and, on the other hand, the words Rketc. occurring in the end may be taken as indicating the Vedas and thus there arises a doubt as to which of these two interpretations is the more reasonable and correct of the two. The Doubt.. is open to the same objections, and capable of the same justifications, as those in connection with the sentence ‘aktäḥ çarkarāḥ,etc. Sūtra Iiv.
evaṃ tarhi tenaiva gatatvānnaitadāravyavyam/	Objection In that case the present question may be taken as having been effectively dealt with by that same sūtra and as such there is no need of its being taken up for consideration again.
nāyamupālambhaḥ saṃdigdheṣu hi vākyaśeṣasya tatra prāmāevamuktam / iha punarvidhyuddeśavarttināmṛgādiśabdānāṃ niḥsaṃdigghamantrabhedajātavacanatvādasaṃdigdha eva vidhyuddeśaḥ /	Reply This reproach is scarcely justifiable as what has been established in that sutra is the authoritative character of the sequence of a sentence, in cases where the bearing of the Injunction is doubtful while in the case in question, there is no doubt as to the bearing of the Injunction, as there is no doubt as to the Rk, Sama,etc. being denoted by the words occurring in the Injunction. Consequently it becomes absolutely necessary to definitely ascertain the correctness of one of the two alter natives, by finding out which word is to be taken in its secondary figu.
kiṃ prāptam/	rative sense.
tadoyapūrvapakṣanyāyenaiva vidhyuddeśaśrutibajoyastvājjātādhikāra iti kiṃ ca	In accordance with the arguments advanced under the Pürvapakshu of Sutra Iiv, it must be admitted, on the strength of the direct Declaration of the object of Injunction, that the properties pertain to the communities of the Rk,etc. i.e.
na kathaṃ cit ṛgādiśabdena brāhmaṇaṃ vaktuṃ śakyam / śaknoti tu vedaśabda ekadeśepi varttituṃ samudāyaśabdānā mekadeśevapyupalabdhaḥ yathā grāma āyāta iti /	to the Verse, etc., and not to the Rgveda, etc.. And further, just as the Generic Substance or Action is not incompatible with special forms appearing in the sequential sentences so, in the same manner, the Rk,etc. are not incompatible with the Vedas. Nor are the words Rk,etc. ever capable of being used with reference to the Brahmanaportion of the Vedas while the word Vēda can be used with reference to any part of the Veda be it even a single Verse as words expressive of a collection are always found to be applicable to single components of that collection as, for in stance, we speak of the whole village having come when the word village is used with reference to the men in the village.
tathā cādhyetārasta naiva sutarāṃ prayuñjate vedama ghīmahe vedo varttataiti /	Thus too, people who are reading the Veda, speak of reading the Veda, and of the Veda remaining to be finished,etc. etc.
na ca brāhmaṇamadhīyānāstathā vadanti /	only when they are study. ing the Rkportion of it, and not when they are reading the Brāhmaṇa portion.
ṛco hi tā eva kāścittriṣvapi vedeṣu padyante tathā yajūṃṣi / tatra yadi vedatvaṃ dharmasaṃbandhacetustatastādṛśeṣu na jñāyate ko dharmaḥ kriyatā mityanyāyyo vā vikalpa āśrīyate vedāntaravyapradeśasya tulyabalatvāt /	V Then again, there is a definite line differentiating the Rk, the Sama and the Yajush from one another and as such their properties of loudness could be duly ascertained and delegated to each of them. Vedas on the other hand are mixed up with one another and as such that would always be a hopeless admixture of the properties in question. That is to say, there are certain Rkverses that are found in all the three Vedas and so also are certain Yajush sentences. And hence if the character of the Vedas were the sole criterion for the application of the properties, then, in the case of such verses it could not be ascertained whether they should be recited loudly or slowly because as occurring in the Rgveda they should be recited loudly, while as occurring in the Yajurveda they should be repeated quietly or we would have to take the properties as optional alternatives, because the applicability to them of the name of one Veda would be as correct and justifiable as that of the other and there are no grounds for such option.
jātipakṣe tu naiṣa doṣo na hyekasminvarṇasamūce jātidvayaṃ samavetam /	If, however, we take the words Rk,etc. in the sentence in question as expressing the classes of Rk etc., then we are saved from these anomalies because a single collection of letters does not belong to any two classes Rk and Sama f.i..
jyotiṣṭomaprakaraṇaṃ caivamanugrahīṣyate anyathā vedasya samasteṣṭipaścekā chāṃhīnasa caviṣayatvādyāvahedānusārī dharmaḥ prakaraṇamujhaṅghya sārvatrikaḥ syāt /	The latter theory has the further advantage of being in keeping with the indications of the fact of the sentences in question occurring in the context of the Jyotishtoma. Otherwise if the words were taken as referring to the particular Vedas, then, inasmuch as the Veda treats equally of all GrainSacrifices, AnimalSacrifices, Oneday sacrifice, etc., the properties laid down in the sentence in question would pertain to all these sacrifices and would thus overstep the bounds of the context in which it occurs.
nanu jātādhikāropi vedavajjātasya prakaraṇāntaradhvapi bhāvāttulyametat / atha prakṛtajātātikramakāraṇābhāvādiha vyavasthā sā vedapakṣepyaviśiṣṭā yāvānprakaraṇe veda ityavadhārapyāt /	Objection Even in accordance with your theory, inasmuch as the class Rk also would be found in several contexts, the contingency you have just shown would be equally possible in your case also. If you seek to restrict the injunction to the Rk in the context, on the ground of there being no reason for overstepping the bounds of the Context,then the same may be said in our case also because we could restrict the injunction to that much of the Veda as occurs in the Context. Reply The two cases are not equally open to the objection because for us, inasmuch as the genus Rk inheres completely in each collection of letters known as such, we have it in the Context, in its complete form for you, on the other hand, the Veda being a very large collection, it cannot exist, in its complete form, in the Context.
sarvargādisamūheṣu jātaṃ vyāsaṅgi cedbhavet/ prakṛtau na samāpyeta tatastadapi vedavat	If the class R had pervaded, as a single whole, over the collection of all Rks, then it could not exist, in its complete form, in the Context and in that case, it would be exactly like the Veda. For the character of Vedatva inheres only in the collection of all Mantras, Brāhmaṇas and Deductions known as the Kathaka and the likewhich treat of many sacrifices.
samūhāstvekavākyānāṃ ye pādapadaparvaṇām / ṛgyajuḥ sāmajātāni pratyekaṃ teṣu santi naḥ /	For us, on the other hand, the generic character of the Rk, or Sāma or Yajush inheres, in its complete form, in each of the endless collections of such feet of verses, words and parts, as are found to form a single syntactical whole.
yathā vanādisaṃghātāḥ prāvasāmānya samanvitāḥ /	And just as such corporate collective substances as the Forest are related to the community of Vanatva, so it is this community of the collections of Rk that is spoken of as jäta in the sūtra.
tathargādisamūhānāṃ sāmānyaṃ jātamucyate dvivaca pade jātigaśabdatvaṃ na kalpitam / vākyatvavatkathaṃ nu syurṛgyajuḥ sāmajātayaḥ yaugikānāṃ yathā jāte ranyatmāmānya miṣyate /	Though the Bhashya, and the commentators on it, have ex “plained the word ‘jāta as synonymous with ‘jäti, yet this explanation is not correct because there can be no jati genus or class in the Rk,etc. Because we have shown in the Tarkapada that there is no such class as ‘goçabdatva inhering in the word go which is made up of the two letters g and and then how could there be any such classes as the Ṛk, Sūma and Yajush, all of which would be as impossible as the class Vakyatva? That is to say, we have already shown, under the Tadbhūtādhikaraṇa, that we cannot, like the class Brāmaṇatva, assume any such class as Vakyatva as inhering either in the last letter of the sentence or in the whole aggregate of letters arranged in a certain order, each of which is manifestable by means of distinct efforts, organs and positions of speech because of the fact of these letters being separated from one another by the intervention of the desire to recognize the relationship of the denotations of words with parts differing from one another.
tathā samūhasāmānyaṃ jātaṃ jāti vilakṣaṇam	For these reasons, what we must take the word jāta to mean is the aggregate communitycalled Rk, or Yajush, or Samawhich Ṛk, inheres in every one of such collections of words as form a single syn.
vedo vā prāyadarśanāt	Sūtra It pertains to the Veda because of the fact of the words occurring in a context dealing mostly with the Veda.
kimidaṃ prāyadarśanāditi /	Question What do you mean by Prayadarçana here? Certainly it is not similar to the Prayadarçanas mentioned in other places that is why we put you the question.
prāyavacanācetyatra hi pradhānaprāye yatrānyāni pradhānāni tatra vacanādityuktam / tathā viṣaye prāyadarśanāditi saṃskāraprāye yatrānye saṃskārā godohanādayastatrāsya darśanamiti/	has been explained as because of the mention being in a content where all the rest are PrimartesPräyê being taken as · Pradhānaprāyê so also in the sutra Viçayē prayadurçanāt IIiii, the word praya has been explained as sanskäraprāya, the meaning of the sutra beingbecause we find it in a context where all the rest are subsidiary purificatory rites, such as the milking of the cow,etc. In the case in question, however, we cannot take the sutra to bring forward the reason that the Rk, etc., are seen where all the rest are Vedas because there are no Vedas apart from these Rk,etc. themselves and hence the latter could not be spoken of as appearing in the midst of the former.
na hyetadvyatiriktā vedāḥ santi yeṣāṃ madhyapāte saṃkocerana ato neha prāyadarśanamastīti /	Consequently there can be no prayadarçana in the case in question.
yattu vidhyuddeśananīyastvā darthavādapadastho vedaśabdo 'vayava viṣayo bhaviṣyatīti /	Reply What we mean is that these words Ṛk, etc.are found in Vedaprāya i.e. in a Context that begins with speaking of the Veda and as such are presented to the mind which is pervaded by the idea of the Veda. The Bhashya quotes the sentence wherein there is a mention of the Veda, and in continuation of which we have the sentence under consideration.
tatra brūmaḥ	tasmāt . . . . trayo dēva ajāyanta .
J ye hi vidhyuddeśātparastādarthavādāḥ śrayante teṣā masti daurbalyaṃ ye purastāt śrūyante te mukhyatvāilīyāṃso bhavanti /	That is to say, those Arthavadas that are found in the Veda after the object of the Injunction has been mentioned, may be weaker in their authority than the Injunction but those that appear before them are certainly stronger, because of their appearing first mukhya, lit..
sarvasyaiva hi śabdasya svārthātinlaṅghane virodhaḥ kāraṇaṃ, sa ca prayogidṛṣṭe vi rodho vijñāyate, tadiha yadā trayo vedā asṛjyantāune gveda ityādi śrūyate na tadā jātavacanānāmṛgādīnāmuccāraṇāma sti, yadarśanena vedaśabdo 'vayavacakṣaṇārtho bhavet /	As a matter of fact, in the case of every word the only reason that can make it give up its direct denotation is the incompatibility of that denotation with something else expressed on a stronger authority and this incom patibility is cognized only when this something else, its counterentity, has been perceived. And in the case in question we find that, at the time that we meet with the sentence trayo vēdā asṛjyanta, etc., we have no mention of the words Rk,etc. which you hold to be denotative of the community, as these words appear after some time, lower down in the direct denotation of the word Vedah in the former sentence could be found to be incompatible, and the word taken as indirectly indicating the component Rk,etc. Thus then, while the mind is fully pervaded with the idea of the Veda directly denoted by the word Vedāḥ, we come across, in a subsequent sentence, the words Rk,etc. in the sentence under consideration and finding that in their direct denotations, these latter words are not construable with the rest of the sentence, we take them, on the strength of this incompatibility, in their indirect sense i.e.
naitadevam	as indicating the source of the Rk, etc., the several Vedas.
ye hi bhinnavākyagatāḥ parasparanirapekṣā virodhino 'rthāḥ śrayante teṣāṃ pūrvasyottarānupamahenaiva lavyātmakatvāduttarasya pūrvepamana vinātmanābhānupapatteḥ paurvāparyabanīyasvanyāyo bhavati /	That is to say, when we find certain contradictory things spoken of, independently of one another, in distinct sentences, then alone do we find that, while the sentence occurring first appears in its full form without having to set aside anything else, the sentence appearing subsequently is not capable of having an existence without setting aside its contradictory precedent and hence in such cases alone we apply the rule of the stronger authority of that which follows over that which goes before.
tatra hyākāṅkṣāvaśena ekavākyatā bhavati, pūrvapratīte cottaramātmāna guṇamadhikaṃ vākāṅkṣati, ataśca yadanadhikamananuguṇaṃ vā tadanapekṣitatvāt naiva tasminvākyasti /	In a case, however, where the things are spoken of as dependent upon one another, that rule is not applicable because in such cases the two sentences are syntactically connected, on the sole ground of their mutual requirements and under the circumstances, it is that which has been already cognized by means of the preceding sentence, that requires what is subsequently mentioned, to be in keeping with itself, or to add something over and above itself consequently that which is not found to be over and above this, or to be in keeping with it, is not taken as syntactically connected with the previous sentence, for the simple reason that it is not required by it.
na cāvidyamānena pūrvabādhaḥ śakyataiti pūrvabanīyastvaṃ bhavati /	And at the time that the preceding sentence expresses its meaning, the subsequent sentence does not exist, and as such could not set it aside consequently it is the preceding sentence that possesses stronger authority.

And just as, in other cases, there is othing incongruous in the Arthavādas being taken in their indirect indicated sense, because of their being mere descriptive eulogies,so, in the same manner, in the case in question, where the Injunction has the same object that has been already mentioned in the preceding Arthavāda, the words Rk, etc, are merely descriptive references to the Veda therein mentioned, and as such there can be nothing incongruous in these being taken as indirectly indicating the Vedas. Consequently the whole sentence under consideration should be construed in the following way Inasmuch as these Vedas came out of Agni, etc., they should be recited loudly,etc. and it is with reference to this wellestablished fact that we have the subsequent words Rk,etc. in the sentence uccaiḥ rca, etc..

It is true that they use it in that way but in the case of all such usages, we must take the word Veda as used in its secondary meaning. But in spite of this usage, in accordance with the Sutra Iiii, we must admit that the Indication that of the Vedu by the words Rk,etc. is more authoritative than the other that of the mantras by the word Veda .

tasmādapi vedādhikāra iti siddham guṇe svarūpato dharmaḥ pradhānadvārato 'paraḥ /	Consequently, it follows that in the word Trayividya, the word trayi is used in the sense of the Three Vedas and hence it must be admitted that the words Rk, Sama and Yajush, which are spoken of in lexicons as coexten sive with the word trayi, denote the Vedas themselves and thus too we find that the words Rk,etc. are applied to the Vedas.

The fact is that that which is enjoined by one Veda, is always done in that Veda consequently a mantra would be called by the name of that Veda in which it may be enjoined. Sūtra Because of being connected syntactically with Veda, the indication by the words Ṛk,etc. of the Rgveda,etc. could be set aside by the context.

Reply Not so because that Sama does not form an auxiliary to the Jyotishtoma and the Injunctions of loudness, appearing in the context of the Jyotishṭoma, could pertain to those Samas of the Hymns occurring in that sacrifice and as a matter of fact we find that in that sacrifice no Sama is sung which is not based upon a Rk.

In such cases the question arises as to whether the Accessory singing is to be done in a way in keeping with the Veda in which its Primary happens to be laid down f. i. quietly, on account of the Āthāna being laid down in the Yajurveda, or it is to be done in a way in keeping with the Veda in which it is itself laid down f.i.

That is to say, the two qualifications being wholly incompatible with each other, and hence it being necessary to set aside one of them, it is always that pertaining to the Accessory by itself that is to be set aside as it is only thus that the Primary would be performed as it should be, without its being deprived of its own accompaniments and certainly the proper fulfilment of the Primary is a business of the Accessory also as this latter also operates solely for the sake of the former.
yadi hi yajurvedaevaiṣāmutpattiḥ syāt tatsvarūpanimitta mevopāṃśutvaṃ sthā, deteṣāṃ tu sāmavedotpannānāṃ svarūpata uccaistva prasaṅge pradhāna saṃparśa nimittamupāṃśutvamiti pradhānadharmatā /	Conse quently, if, in consideration of its own qualification, it were to deprive the Primary of its natural accompaniment, then there would be a disruption of that action the Primary for the sake of which it was meant to operate. Though in such a case the proper fulfilment of the Primary with all its accompaniments would mean the deprival of the Accessory of its own natural accompaniment,yet, as the fact of the Accessory being equipped with all its accompaniments is not so very necessary as that of the Primary, there would be nothing incongruous in the said deprival. Consequently, inasmuch as the Adhana belongs to the Yajurvēda, the Sāmas that are accessory to it should be sung quietly.
nanu yajurvedena sāṅgaṃ kuryādityupabandhātmāṅgasyaivopāṃśutva mityavadhāraṇādastyevāṅga svarūpa saṃsparśa iti /	J Objection As a matter of fact, we recognize the rule to be that only that much of the Adhāna is to be done quietly, which is enjoined in the Yajurveda and as such the quietness could not pertain to the singing of the Sama. It is only the Primary action the Adhāna itself and its other Accessories that belong to the Yajurveda and hence it is these alone that should be done quietly.
na / sāṅgakathanenaivāprādhānya nirdeśāt / upasarjanabhūtāṅgaṃ hi pradhānamevaṃ niddiśyate /	Reply It is not so because it is distinctly shown in Satra XI ii that the Accessories are enjoined as along with the Primary, because of the injunction and also in Sūtra XIi that on account of the whole Injunction of the Primary with its Accessories forming a single declarationetc. all the accessories are to be performed in accordance with the Primary.
tena pradhānameva yājurvedikamupāṃśutvaṃ tu taddharma eva sannaṅgānyupasarpannevaṃ kathyate/	Consequently when we find certain Accessories mentioned in the comprehensive Injunction of the performance of the Primary with all its accessories, even if these Accessories be found to have their origin elsewhere in another Veda f.i.,their Injunction will have to be taken as belonging to that Veda wherein we have the Primary.

And further the Quietness of the Sāma, as pertaining to it as an Accessory, is equal to its Loudness and the Quietness inhering in the Accessory singiny cannot be spoken of as belonging to the Primary Adhāna and hence the rejection of the Quietness inhering in the Accessory would mean a rejection of the qualification of the Primary and such a rejection would not deprive the performance of the Primary of its natural Quietness.
nanvevamapyaṅgadharmaḥ sākṣātprāpnoti pradhānadharmaḥ punaḥ paradāreṇa parokṣa tantravārtike /	Reply It is in view of the fact of the Sāmas having their originative Injunction in the Samavedu that those appearing in connection with the Yajurvedic action of Adhana are spoken of as belonging to a different Veda and it is only in consequence of the Primary Ādhāna being laid down as connected with all its Accessories, that we come to conclude that the Samasingingone of these Accessoriesis to be done quietly.
iti viparītaṃ balābalaṃ prāpnoti /	Because it is only when the Primary has certain Acces sovics subservient to it that it is spoken of as sanga.

Thus then, if the Samasinging in connection with the Ādhāna were not done quietly, it would be the Qualification of the Primary, as pertain ing to the Accessory, that would be rejected because the Primary throws its Qualification into the Accessories and hence in whichsoever accessory that Qualification would be rejected, that would mean a deficiency in the Primary itself.
nanu yājurvedikajyotiṣṭomādyaṅgānāṃ stotraśastrādīnāmapyanenaiva nyāyenopāṃśutvaṃ prāpnoti /	As for Loudness, it is not recognized as a qualification of the Primary Adhana because the Qualification of the Accessories are never trans ferred to the Primary. Objection We find that the natural qualification of the Accessory Quietness could belong to that Accessory, only indirectly, through the Primary and thus the comparative authoritativeness of the two would be quite contrary to what you hold it to be i.e.
satyaṃ prāpnoti vacanāttu sarvatra svarāntarajābhaḥ /	the former would be more authoritative than the latter.

Reply True it does become applicable to these also.

That is to say, in connection with the Larçapurnamasa, there are Accessories enjoined in two Vedas and it would appear as if various Vedie accents were to be employed in connection with these but in accord ance with the law laid down in the sutra under discussion, they would all become amenable to the single tone of Quietness which belongs to the Yajurvedic Primary the Darçapurnamāsa. But then finally, we come across certain Vedic Directions laying down definite Tones for them,f.i. the directions.

Similarly there are certain Vikri sacrifices, modifications of the Darçapurnamāsu offerings, such as the Ishti, the Paçubanilha, etc., which would appear to be subject to the three tones just mentioned in connection with their Original the Darçapūrṇumāsa but, on account of the fact of their being directly enjoined as subsidiary to a sacrifice belonging to a par. ticular Veda the Yajurveda, they come to be taken as done with the tone peculiar to this Veda i.e.
dhenaiva sāṅgānāṃ prāptāḥ/	quietly .

Exactly in the same manner, in the case of the Dikshaniya, etc., subsidiaries of the Jyotishtom. bility is set aside by the fact of their injunctions being contained in a particular Veda which fact would justify the use of a single tone but it is again brought forward by the distinct Injunction that the ectypes are to be performed in the same way as their archetypes but then it is found that the Jyotishtoma belongs to the Yajurveda, and that it does not take up the apparently useful qualifications of any Original for the simple reason that it is not the ectype of any other sacrifice and hence in accordance with the sutra under discussion, the subsidiaries in question would come to be taken as amenable to the Quiet tone of the Jyotishtoma but the application of the present sūtra to this case is set aside by the distinct Injunction that one should recite the Dikshaṇīyä in whatever tones he may desire, which distinctly lays down all the three tonesHigh, Medium and Lowfor the Dikshaṇīyā together with all its subsidiary Hymns,etc. In the same manner, inasmuch as the Jyotish toma is found to be amenable to the three tonesthe Low, the Medi un and the Highlaid down in connection with each of its dis tinctly mentioned three Savanas, all its subsidiaries also come, through the Primary, to be connected with the same three tones.

nanu ruva naśabdānāṃ somayāgāvayavavacanatvāddī kṣaṇīyādyaṅgavattadīyakharābhāvapramaṅga iti cet na /	Objection Inasmuch as the words of the Savana are expressive of the parts of the Soma sacrifice, they could not have the tones of the Savana, just as the subsidiaries of the Dīkshaṇīyā do not have the tones of the Dikshaṇīyā.” Reply Not so because the Locative ending in Savanē distinctly shows that the tones belong to all the mantras that are used at the time of the Savana and hence even though the words he expressive of the parts of the Soma sacrifice, yet they would be amenable to the tones of the Savana.

Question Then, in that case, we could have the tone of two Vedas in a case, where, the Vikrti belonging to a Veda other than to which its Original belongs, and the remaining accessories of that Vikṛti having the tone of the original, another new accessory happens to bo enjoined in the same Veda as the Vikrti. S But that too could not be as in this case also the tone is got at through the Primary itself.

syāt / atra samādhiḥ upāṃśu yajuṣeti tāvatsarvadaviṃdo meṣvarthavahaksāmavedayorapi kāmyanaimittikeṣvaṅgeṣvarthavattā /	To the above, we make the following reply It would not be useless as the injunction what is done through the Yajush is to be done quietly would apply to all the Darvihomas as these employ only Yajush mantras. Then as for the Rgveda and the Samavedu, the injunction of Loudness with regard to these would have its use in connection with accessories other than the necessary ones that is with those that are laid down with a view to a particular desirable result, and that which is laid down as to be performed only when certain specified conditions present themselves.
evaṃ yājurvedikamapyupāṃtvamudāharttavyam / tathā yāni sutyottara kānānyaṅgāni teṣu savanagrahaṇābhāvādyathāvedameva svara ityavabhṛthasāmādīnāmapyuccaistvasiddhiḥ anyathā hi yatheṣṭaṃ prayogaḥ syād /	such as The morning suvana is to be done in low tones, are neces sary ones and as such they belong only to the necessary accessories, not being connected with the kimya that which is done with a view to a certain desirable result and the Naimittika the conditional, to be performed only when certain conditions present themselves accessories. Consequently any accessories of the latter two kinds, that are enjoined by the Rgveda or the Samaveda, are to be done loudly as for instance, Bhinnamabhimriçedyatrite, cidabhiçrishaḥ, etc.,etc. In the same way we could cite instances of the Yajurvedic Quietness of tone so also, those accessories of the Jyotishtoma that appear after the Sutyä, not being taken up by the Savanas and hence not being connected with Suvana tones, come to have the same tone as that belonging to the Veda in which each of them occurs and hence it becomes established that the Samasinging of the Avabhrtha also is to be done loudly.
dīkṣaṇīyādiparisāmasuta prācīnamagnīṣomoyādityanenoṣāṃśutvaṃ prava rgyasāmnāṃ punaruccaiḥ pravarmyetyevamuccaimtvam /	In the Samas about the Dikshuniya, however, we will have the Quiet tone of the Yajurvela because of the specific direction that all that precedes the Agnishoma is to be done quietly while again for the Pravarjya Sāmas, we would have Loudness, according to the Direction Ucoaiḥ pravarjyena.
ya evaṃ vidvā nvāmadevyaṃ gāyati ityādīni yajurvedavākyānyeva tasmādinadāharaṇam /	As for the Samas connected with the Adhana, however, we would have them done quietly, because of their being laid down by Injunctions in connection with a Primary sacrifice belonging to the Yajurveda for the sentences yu ēvam vidvān Vāmadevyam gayati,etc. belong to the Yajurveda.
svarūpotpattimātrāpekṣayā mena kriyataiti na kāraka hetvabhiprāyeṇopanyāsa iti / tattu na yuktamevaṃ sati yutpattiviniyogabalābala cintaiva kriyate na gupā mukhya virodhacintā /	But this reasoning is scarcely correct for in that case the discussion would have turned upon a consideration of the comparative strength and weakness of Originative and Applicatory Injunctions, and not of the contradiction between the properties of the Primary and the Accessory as is done in the sutra and in that case, the Siddhanta conclusion would have been in the form that inasmuch as the performance is dependent upon the Applicatory Injunctions, greater authoritativeness should be attached to this latter and the Samas would be sung quietly in the Jyotish toma for this reason, and not for the reason of the Sāma being an Acces sory and hence not taking its own character of Loudness which is contra dictory to the character of the Primary Jyotishtomu, as declared in the sütra.
tasmātmāmaveda śākhāyāmapi kasyāṃ cidastyeṣāṃ vidhirata udāharaṇamityapare /	In view of this, there is yet another explanation offered by some people it is this In certain texts of the Samaveda itself, there are applicatory Injunctions of the Sämas that are laid down in the Yajurveda also. And thus there would be a contradiction between these two Injunctions, on which the sutra is based.
tadā tu yajurve ḍhapunaḥ śrutermandaṃ phalaṃ syāt /	But if there were such an applicatory Injunction of the Sama in the Samaveda itself, the more repetition of the same Injunction in the Yajurveda would have very little use.
athāpi śākhāntara vidhivadāśrīyeta svaravikalpaśca pūrvapakṣe kriyeta yadi udāhiyetānudāharaṇāttu naitadupapadyate /	And this too, only if such an Injunction alleged to exist in the Samaveda were actually quoted from it. If, however, no such actual Injunction be forthcoming, the explanation offered could not be admissible.. For these reasons, then, we must take the words guna Acces sory and ‘mukhya Primary in the sutra to have been used in the sense of the Originative and the Applicatory Injunctions respectively.
tasmādutpatti viniyogayoreva gugāmukhyatvamityevamadhikaraṇamārabhyate yatra vedāntarotpannaṃ vasta vedāntareṇa viniyajyate tatra kimutpattivedadharmaḥ kartavyaḥ utta tantrakārtika / viniyogave dadharma iti utpattiparvakatvādviniyogasyotpattivedadharma iti prāpte viniyogavedadharma iti gṛhyate/	And accordingly we should expound the Adhikaraṇa in the following manner Question to be dealt with In a case where a thing, having its origin that thing be equipped with the properties peculiar to the former Veda, or with those of the latter? Pūrvapaksha Inasmuch as the origination of a thing always precedes its application, the properties employed should be those of the Veda in which it has its origin. Siddhanta The properties should be those of that Veda which lays down its application because the origination of a thing is only for the sake of the uses to which it may be applied because it is only when the thing in questionthe Sāmasingingis applied to use that it stands in need of some tone to be applied to it and hence the tones enjoined in the Injunction Uccuiḥ rca,etc. are those that are perceived at the time of usage, and not at the time of the origination as there is no injunction of its being brought into action at that time. Or, we could take the word ‘vyatikrama in the sutra, not as signify ing either Rejection or Contradiction, but as denoting nonconcomitance, i.e.
kutaḥ /	existence in different places.
athavā naivātra vyatikramaśabdena bādho virodho vābhidhīyate kiṃ tarhi vyabhicāronyatrānyatra ca vṛttistenaivaṃ cintyate yatrotpa ttiviniyogau vyatikrāntau anyatrotpattiranyatra viniyogastatra kataravedasaṃyogo bhavatviti /	Thus then, we would have the Adhikarana as follows Question In a case where the Origination and the Application of a certain thing are nonconcomitant,i.e. the origination is in one Vedu and the application in another, with the properties of which Veda should the Sama be equipped? Pūrvupaksha It must be equipped with the properties of the Originative Veda, or with those of one or the other, optionally. Siddhanta It should be equipped with those of the Applicatory Veda as application is the more important factor. If then, on the strength of the Injunction, that Performer should be accepted who is mentioned in the same Veda with the Accessory, then the tone to be employed would also be the same that belongs to the Accessory and it would not be proper to employ the tone of the Primary.
tathaivotpattisaṃyoge vikalpe vā prāpte viniyogavedasaṃyogaḥ prādhānyādityuttaram /	For this reason, it is best to take the Adhikaraṇa as based upon the consideration of the comparative authoritativeness of the Originative and the Applicatory Injunctions. As it is only thus that the citing of the example of Adhana appears justifiable.
atha vaivaṃ cintā yatrānyatra ca pradhānam anyatra cāṅgaṃ tatrāṅgasya kena vedena vyapradeśosviti /	. Sūtra The Action mentioned in two Vedas is to be taken as belonging to that in which most of its constituent details are found. We now proceed to consider the question after which Veda a certain Primary action is to be called, when it is found to be mentioned in more than one Veda.
asmiṃstu pakṣe tadgrahaṇādvā svadharmā syādityetadvādhitvā pradhānasamākhyāta eka eva prakṛta/	The Siddhanta conclusion is that it is to be called after that Veda in which we find it laid down originatively, and not as a mere subsidiary. To the above we make the following reply There can be no option in the matter of different Vedas, as there is in the case of different texts of the same Veda consequently one Veda must be taken as enjoining the sacrifice, and the other as mentioning it simply for the purpose of laying down certain accessories for it.
aya tu codakabalīyasvāda ṅgaveda samā khyātakarṭa grahaṇaṃ tataḥ svaropi tathaivetyayuktaṃ pradhānasvaragrahaṇam / ata utpattiviniyogāpekṣayaivaiṣa vicāra ityeṣaiva vyākhyā śobhanā /	Then there arises the questionIn the case of the Jyotishtoma for instance, which of the two Vedas Sāma or Yajush is to be accepted as enjoining it? The reply to this is that that Veda which appears to mention the greatest number of the accessory details, making up the procedure of the sacrifice, should, for that very reason, be accepted as enjoining the perform ance of that sacrifice. For instance, in the case of the Jyotishtoma, it is in the Yajurveda that the largest number of details of procedurein the shape of the Dikshaniya, etc.are found mentioned. of as Yajurvēdēna kriyatē, which means that being pointed out by that Veda, it is created by it or that being performed in accordance with that, it is spoken of as ‘being done by it.
na śākhāntaravadyuktī vikalpa/	very But this explanation of the word bhūyastva in the sutra is not quite correct.
tāḍheiko guṇārthe/ kaścideko vidhāyakaḥ /	Because when a certain thing has been recognized, from its nature, to be indicative of something else, a little or more of it does not make difference in its cognition.
sa tu jyotiṣṭomādo katama iti /	For instance, when smoke is recog any nized to be indicative of the Fire, whether it be much or little, it must indicate the fire.
guṇānāṃ yatra bhūyastvamitikarttavyatātmakam /	Then again, in the case in question, it is not the largeness of subsidiaries that is meant to be the details of procedure but what people call the subsidiary, that itself is what is meant by the Details of Procedure.
tatra tenaiva niṅgena tasya kartavyateṣyate	Then it might be held that where we find only a little of the details of procedure mentioned, we must take it as laid down with reference to the Primary sacrifice enjoined in another Veda.
yadyamya gamakatvena svaśaktairavadhāritam / tadatvaṃ bahu vā tasya pratītau na viśiṣyate	The following argument might here be brought forward That which is only a little can be more easily taken as pertaining to some thing enjoined in another Veda, than a large number of it could ever be. But it is not so because even in the case of a large number of details, it is possible for the large number of sentences to be taken as pertaining to some Injunction in another Veda.
tathe he tikarttavyatā liṅgatvenopanyastā mā yatrāpyalpā tatrāpi karttavyatayā vinā 'nupapadyamānā śaknotyeva gamayitum	And even though the complete form of the Sacrifice is given in the Yajurveda, yet it is quite possible to establish the relationship of this sacrifice to the Hymns,etc. mentioned in the other Veda as even though these latter serve only transcendental imperceptible ends, yet they are taken as connected with the sacrifice, on the strength of the directions laid down in connection with them. Thus then, the meaning of the sutra comes to be this That action which is mentioned in two Vedas, should have its name ascertained by the mention of a larger numberi.e.
asaṃyuktaṃ prakaraṇāditika rttavyatāthitvāt	Sūtra That which is disconnected by Direct Declara tion, Indicative Power or Syntactical Connection is connected by means of the Context because it stands in need of the details of procedure.
evaṃ tāvat śrutiniṅgavākyāni pradhānajñeyasaṃkīrṇaviviktavi ṣayāṇi pratyudāharaṇaṃ vyākhyātāni/	We have explained above, with examples, the application of mantras by means of Direct Declaratiou, Indicative Power and Syntactical Con nection, dealing with such principal cases as are amenable to them, individually or collectively.
tatra vidhiviniyogābhidhānātmikāyāḥ śruterviniyogasāmarthyātmakasya ca niṅgasya kevalapadaprayogābhāvātpadāntarasaṃnidheravaśyaṃbhāvitvādvākya mantargataprāyameveti na sākṣāgrahaṇena sūcitam / athavā veḍho vā prāyadarśanādityapakramopasaṃhāravaśenaiva vedadharmatvāvadhāraṇādidameva vākyaviniyogasūtramiti na pūrvāntargatimātreṇa vākyasya viniyojakatvaṃ vyākhyeyam /	But out of these three, no mention has been made in the Sutras of Syntactical Connection, because it is almost included in Direct Declarationin the shape of the expression of the application by means of a Direct Injunction, and also in Indicative Power, which consists in the power of the mantrawords themselves to indicate its uses specially as in the case of sentence or Syntactical Connection there is no single word that is used, and it is absolutely necessary to have the proxim ity of another word. As an example of application by Syntactical Connection, the Bhashya has cited the sentence ‘aruṇayā,etc. but in this case it could be very well said that, as in the case of Aindryā, etc., so here also, the application is directly declared by the Instrumental ending in ‘aruṇayā. If the idea in the mind of the author of the Bhashya be that though the Instrumen tal ending points out its relationship with Action in general, yet it is the Syntactical Connection that points out the particular relationship,then, the same may be said of the sentence Aindryä,etc. which too would be come an example of application through Syntactical Connection because in the case of this latter sentence also, the word Aindrya only requires something that is to be addressed, and the word garhapatyam stands in need of only the means or Instrument and hence the particular relation ship between the two particulars is brought about by Syntactical Con nection alone. And hence in both these cases, the Syntactical Connection may be shown to be included in Direct Declaration consequently both the sentences must be taken as instances of both Direct Declaration aud Syntactical Connection.
yattu bhāṣyakāreṇāruṇayetyaḍhāitaṃ śakyaṃ tatrāpyaindrīvattṛtīyā śrutireva viniyojita vaktatṛtīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	As now the consideration of the comparative authoritativeness of Direct Declaration,etc. is drawing near to be done in Sūtra , the sūtra proceeds to point out the forms of the three other means of pointing out the application,as also the way in which they are capable of point.

For instance, the Injunction Darçapūrṇamāsābhyām svurgakāmo yajēta having given the idea that one should obtain Heaven by means of the DarçaPurṇamāsa sacrifices, there arises a question as to how this is to be done and while this how is being expounded in the Veda, we find mentioned certain Actions the Prayajas apparently useless having no use stated in the context, in such sentences as Samidho yajati, Taninapatam yajati, etc.,etc. Now thou, we are led to believe that some help must arrive for the Darça o Purnamāsa in the shape of certain details of its procedure, and also that these latter Prayājās must have some end or purpose to serve.
tasmādubhayatrāpi tadantargatiḥ śakyā darśayitumiti ubhayoḥ śrutivākyayorubhayamuḍhāharaṇam/	Simi larly too with the Prayajas we do not perceive their end or purpose. And yet it is necessary that both of these must exist as otherwise the DarçaPūrṇamāsa could not be performed, and the mention of the Prayā jas in the Veda would be wholly useless.

tatra prakaraṇaṃ viniyogājñānasaṃśaya viparyayāṇāmanyatamenopanyasyati sma /	And in the case in question, it is this fact that will be the ground for admitting the mutual help accorded between the DarçaPurnamāsa and the Prayajas.

Or asamyuktam may be taken as that which is not connected with something contrary to the Context.Those that are connected with its noncontradictories, such, f.i., as in the case of the sentences Vrihin prokshati, ‘Varhirdēvasadanandāmi,’ ‘Aruṇayā krīnāti,etc. Sutra The Order of sequence also serves to point out the application of accessories, on the ground of the sameness of position.
kramaśca deśasāmānyāt	The Order of sequence, consisting of the commonality of position, is of two kinds, as based upon the text and upon actual performance and it is a means of pointing out the application of Accessories.
pūrvavadeva kramasamākhyayorapyajñānādibhirupanyāsaḥ karttavyaḥ vināpyanuṣṭhānadeśasāmyena yāvati pradeśe brāhmaṇe pradhānaṃ padyate māvatyeva mantreṣu mantra,stayoścāṅgāṅgyapekṣāvelāyāṃ yathāsaṃkhyatṛtīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Even when the two are not performed at the same place, if it be found that the mantra appears in the same place in the mantrasection of the Veda, as the Injunction of the Primary sacrifice does in the Brāhmaṇa Section then, when we proceed to seek for the relatives of both, the one brings the other to the mind, by reason of their sameness of position, in accordance with the Law of Sequence.
prathamasya ci pra dhānasya mantramanvicchannavaśyaṃ mantrasamāmnāyamādita jhāragyālocayati / tataśca prathama eva mantraḥ prathamaṃ hṛdayamāgacchati/	That is to say, when we proceed to look for the mantra to be employed in connection with the Primary, that is the first to be enjoined in the Brāhmaṇzsectiou, we begin from the very beginning of the Mantra section and as soon as the first mantra comes to our mind, if we do not find any reasons for passing it over, we accept that as the Mantra sought after.

And in the same manner, the second would be connected with the second, and so forth.

Consequently, the Bhäshya has cited, in the present connec tion, the mantra ‘Dabdhirnāmāsīt, etc., whose connection is not pointed out by the indicative power of its words and which is found mentioned Objection The mantra cited is found to be pointed out by Context, as pertaining to all the actions therein mentioned and as the context is more authoritative than the Order of Sequence, the mantra must be taken as to be employed in other actions also.
atra ke cidāṅaḥ / upāṃśuyāja grahaṇāddayamapyanugṛhyate tasmāttadgrahaṇamiti /	To this, some people make the following reply By connecting the mantra with the Upāmçuyāja, we follow both the Context as well as the Order of Sequence and that is why we take it in that way.
śakyaṃ tu vaktuma anugrāhya eva kramaḥ prakaraṇapratyayaviruddhatvāditi / śeṣasya hi sarvārthatve pratipradhānāvṛtteḥ prakaraṇāvagataṃ na śakyaṃ bādhitum /	But against this explanation it might be urged that it is not proper to follow the Order, when we find it contradictory to the Context because when the Auxiliary belongs to all the actions as is shown by the Context, it has got to be repeated with every Primary action, which would not be the case if it were taken with only one action the Upāmçuyāja, as shown by the Order and hence the following of the Order would mean a rejection of the Context, which cannot be allowed.
tacaitāvaduttaraṃ bhavati yenye śeṣiṣṇa agneyādayaste viṣṭalaḥ kramaprakaraṇavadbhimantrānta rairavarudatvānnai namapekṣante /	Consequently, to the above objection, we offer the following reply The other primary Actions, the Agnèya and the rest, are taken up by other mantras that are connected with them by Indicative Power, as well as by Context and Order and as such they do not stand in need of the mantra in question.
na ca vikalpo'spaṣṭaciṅgatvena vaiṣamyād /	Nor could this mantra be taken as an optional alternative, because its indication with reference to the other sacrifices is not at all distinct.

But that could not be because by pointing out to the Primary sacrifice of the Context, they serve a visible purpose. And even if they served only imperceptible purposes, inasmuch as they are independent of one another, they can never be employed conjointly, so long as there is any other way of utilizing them and only in such a contingency could the mantra in question be employed in connection with the Agneya etc., which having their needs supplied by other mantras, have once rejected it.
na ceḍaśaṃ santaṃ prakaraṇaṃ vi tantravārtika /	But inasmuch as there is a way of utilizing the mantraviz. in connection with the Upamçuyajait cannot be connected with the other sacrifices.

tataśca liṅgena prakaraṇaṃ bādhyata evetyadoṣaḥ /	is only right that this Indicative Power should set aside what is pointed out by the Context.
kāmyayājyā kāṇḍa kramastu vyākhyāta evānuṣṭhānadeśakramopi paśudharmāṇāmagnīṣomīyārthatvena bhaviṣyati	The Order of sequence, as pertaining to the Kāmayājyākāṇda, has been explained. Sutra The Name also does so because it is for that purpose. The Name, that is applied to Actions in its literal sense, is a sure pointer of their relationship and that relationship is shown to be one that the Auxiliary bears to the Primary.
ādhvaryavādisamākhyānāṃ vedaetra prayoga iti na laukikatvacodyaṃ kriyate /	As the names Adhvaryava and the like are used in the Veda alone, we do not show here the objections that were brought forward, on a previous occasion, in regard to the names occurring in ordinary parlance.
tadapekṣamāṇasya ca yadi na kutaścidviśeṣo 'vagamyate tato yatkiñciditi bhaviṣyati /	As a matter of fact we find that the Adhvaryu Priest stands in need of a function for himselfsomething to be done by him and if no particular function present itself, then he would take up anything.
tatra śabdajasyādita evaiṣotprekṣā pratyekaṃ bhavati yadasyādhvaryoḥ karma tadādhvaryavaśabdavācyaṃ bhaviṣyati /	Simi larly the action, called Adhvaryava, stands in need of an auxiliary in the shape of a Person that might perform it. And at the very outset, the idea afforded by the two words Ādhvaryava and Adhvaryu is that the action that is done by the Adhvaryu is called Adhvaryava, and that he who is the performer of the Adhvaryava action is one who is called Adhvaryu the signification of the basic noun Adhvaryu in the word Ādhvaryava indicating that of the derivative Ādhvaryava, or vice versa.
yadyapi śabdāntaraṃ vikāra ityubhāvapyeto parasparanirapekṣau ni tyasaṃbandhī ca tathāpi nityāyā eva śabdapravṛttarnityaḥ saṃbandho nimittamiti sarvayaugikānāmevamanvākhyānam /	Though the derivative is a distinct word, and hence the two words Adhvaryu and Adhvaryava are independent of each other, and have independent eternal relation with their respective significations, yet inasmuch as it is only the eternal functioning of a word that depends upon an eternal relationship, we have given the above explana tion with regard to all such names as are applied to things in their literal sense and we have already shown before under the Avēshtyadhikarana that the functioning of the word Rajya has had no beginning in time. As for the causal relationship between the word and its meaning, there is nothing incongruous in it, even if they be eternal.
na hi rājya śabdasyāpyādimatī pravṛttirityuktam /	If the connection were established before the functioning of the Name, then the Nume would not be the means of pointing out the necessary application.
nimittanaimittikabhāvastvanāditvepi śabdārthayorivedāviruddhaḥ /	Consequently, we must take the pointing out of the application of the Adhvaryava as based upon the two words Adhvaryu and Adhvaryava they are similar in form, though they are taken in the ordinary conventional signification and not literally, and are independent of each other.
na tvetadyuktam /	But this is scarcely correct.
na hi ruḍhānāṃ sārūghyādupasthāpanasāmarthyaṃ dharmasaṃbandhepyasti / yathā kaṇvarathantare ra thantaradharmānnirākariṣyati kimutātra kriyākartṛsaṃbandhe pāvakāyudāharaṇaṃ vā yuktaṃ syāttasmād yaugikatvamevābhyupagantavyam /	Because the words that have no literal signification have not the capacity to point to one another in matters relating to the qualifications, even though they may be similar in form for instance, the qualifications of the Rathantarasāma do not belong to the Kanvarathantarasamaas will be shown later on it is all the more so in the case in question, where the relationship meant is one of the Action Ādhvaryava and its Performer Adhvaryu as otherwise the citing of such instances as pavakaetc. would be wholly irrelevant if no im portance were attached to the name applying in its literal sense.
yattu prāk prayogātpramāṇaṃ nāstīti satyaṃ pratyakṣaṃ nāstīti samākhyayaivānumīyamānaṃ bhaviṣyati/	Conse quently, we must admit the word under consideration to be taken as apply ing literally. It has been argued above that prior to the performance, there is no ground for admitting the word in its literal signification. Though it is true that there is no such perceptible ground, yet, it could be inferred from the Name itself.
ve hi prathamameva kriyākartṛsaṃbandho niṣpanastasminsati samākhyā pravṛttā vayaṃ tu taṃ saṃbandhaṃ pramāṇāntareṇāpratipādyamānāḥ samākhyādarśanena pratipadyāmace tena jñāyate pūrvaṃ samākhyā paścātlaṃbandha iti /	In matters relating to the Veda, the relationship of the Action and its Performer is established from time immemorial and it is while this relationship is existent that the Name is applied. We, however, not comprehending that relationship by any other means, come to compre hend it only by means of the Nume and from this we are led to believe that the Name precedes the relationship.
vastutastu prathamameva saṃbandhaḥ sa cāpratītopi sattāmātreṇaiva samākhyāṃ pravarttitavān yadi hyeṣādimatī syāttataḥ prayoktuḥ prathamaṃ saṃbandhāvagatyā bhavitavyam /	In reality however it is the Relationship that precedes it and though not comprehended, it is that Relationship which leads, by its mere existence, to the application of the Name. If this Name had a beginning, then it would be necessary for the Performer to have a prior knowledge of its relationship and inasmuch as this is not possible, we might be liable to reproach on that account. As a matter of fact, however, we admit the relationship to be eternal and as such there certainly exists some sort of a relationship with the eternally functioning Name and this having been duly established, it would be on the ground of the apparent inconsistency of this relationship, that we would subsequently come to accept the relationship of the Auxiliary and the Primary.

As against the wording of the sutra, some people make the follow ing declaration The sutra should have laid down conflict as a condition because in the case of the sentence ‘aruṇayā krīṇāti we have found that though both Direct Assertion and the rest point to the same object, yet, inasmuch as they are not found to be conflicting each other, we do not stop to consider which of them has the stronger authority. That is to say, we find that in any case, the Redness alone is the accessory concerned and by Direct Assertion, this Redness is pointed out as connected with Action in general by Syntactical Connection it is pointed out as connected with the particular action of purchase and by the Context it is shown to be connected with that Purchase which pertains to the Jyotishtoma sacrifice and though thus we find all these three bearing upon the same object of Redness, yet, inasmuch as each of them is found to assist, and not contradict, the other, we do not stop to consider which of them is possessed of the greater authoritative strength.
kraya svarūpamātraprayuktatve cānarthakatvādapekṣite hi śrutivākyābhyāṃ vākyaprakaraṇe /	Specially as no good would come out of the reference being made indefinitely to Action in general, and as it would be absolutely useless to refer the Redness to the mere form of the Purchase, we find that the Direct Assertion and the Syntactical Connection stand in need of the assistance of the Syntactical Connection and the Context respectively.
na vā karttavyam /	Reply It would not be right to make any mention of Conflict.
aruṇāḍhatāvacaiva pramāṇamamavāyosti /	Because it is the fact of bearing upon one and the same object that is spoken of as Samavaya and when the means of cognition Direct Assertionetc. are found to bear upon the same object, then alone is such Samavaya cognized as belonging to the Accessories concerned.
na hokatra saṃbhava mātraṃ samavāyaḥ kiṃ tarhi viṣayaikatvama /	That is to say, in the case of such accessories as the said Redness etc., we do not find a coalition Sumavāya of the means of cognition as Sama vāya does not consist in the possibility of the application of all of them to a single subject, but in the fact of all them actually bearing upon one and the same subject.
ica cāruṇasya kriyāsaṃbandhaḥ śrutvā tasya tu śrutikalpitasya kriyākāraka saṃbandhasya bhūyopyapekṣāvaśena krayaviṣayatvam /	In the case of Redness, we find that its connection with Action is pointed out by Direct Assertion then when this relation ship of the Action and its Agent, pointed out by Direct Assertion, comes to be in need of the specialization of the Action, we have the action of Purchase pointed out by Syntactical Connection but all requirements not being fulfilled by this, there arises a need of further specification and this is supplied by the pointing out by the Context of that Purchase which is connected with the Jyotishtoma, and as such is related to an Apurva.

Then again, in the case of Redness, we find that the acceptance of the remote factor does not involve the rejection of the proximate one because by accepting Purchase we do not reject the relationship of Redness with Action nor by performing the Purchase in connec tion with the Jyotishțoma, do we set aside its connection with Purchase.
saṃbandham / yatra tvekaḥ śeṣastāvāneva ca saṃbandhāntara virodhinaikena pramāṇenānyaśeṣyartho vijñāyate /	As a matter of fact, we have a Samavāya coalition of two means of cognition, only in a case where the Accessory in question is one only and this is pointed out to be subservient to a Primary other than that shown by the other Means the former Means being contrary to its relationship with this latter Primary while the latter means, not finding it compatible not to reject the relationship pointed out by the other Means, points out the accessory as subservient to a distinct Primary and where the Accessory, having its requirements fulfilled by being connected with one Primary, does not stand in need of being employed again.
eka saṃvandhaṃ ca kṛtārthasyākāṅkhābhāvātpunarviniyogāntarānupapattiḥ /	And it is in such cases alone that the Sumavaya of the Means is such as consists in the fact of both of them bearing upon the same object, and being mutually contradictory.

Such a Samavaya involves a contradiction and hence it was not necessary to mention the word conflict over again.

Similarly, in a case where the same Accessory is laid down in connection with the same Primary, by the Proximate as well as the Remote Means, there too it is only one of these latter that is accepted as the operative means, the other being taken as serving some other purpose and in this case too.
tasmādvirodhaviṣayameva samavāyagrahaṇam /	there is no Samavaya, For these reasons, it must be admitted that the mention of Samaraya implies the element of Conflict also.
ekārthavarttitvādāca ityasyāparā vyākhyā / nantravārtika / yeyaṃ bantābanavāgeṣā pratyekaṃ śrutyādiṣu samavaiti na samudāye /	Though it was necessary to have shown the comparative strength of all the six in reference to a single instance, yet, inasmuch as declarations are made in a certain order of sequence, and it is impossible for them to appear all simultaneously, we proceed to take them up one by one and we take up the other means, only because unless there is something else against which the comparison is made, there can be no mention of the comparative strength of that one which has been taken up for considera tion.

For instance, thoseContext,etc. that are suppressed by Indicative Power, are certainly suppressed by Direct Assertion, which suppresses the said Indicative Power and as such those former are not brought into direct comparison with Direct Assertion.
tatra prathamaṃ tāvalamaprāptaṃ śrutiliṅgayoḥ saṃpradhāraṇamiti /	Thus then, as Direct Assertion and Indicative Power are the first two the six, we proceed to take up these two for comparison.

The sense of the question is that iuasmuch as it is impossible for mere words to be used by themselves, in all cases these must occur in a certain sentonce and as such we can have no instance where there would be an exclusive functioning of Direct Assertion and Indicative Power only apart from Syntactical Connection.

That is to say, if Indicative Power has an authority superior to Direct Assertion, then the Greeting should be done to Indra alone if both are equally strong, and mutually contradictory, then it should be done to Indra or to Gārhapatya optionally if they be equally strong, and not contradic.
tatrottaraṃ gārhapatya śabdaśravaṇaṃ mantramāmathrthyaṃ ceti / paraḥ punarāha/	tory to one another, then it should be done to both conjointly and lastly, if Direct Assertion have the superior authority, then, it should be done to Gārhapatya alone.
yadyevaṃvidhapadasamūhātmake śrutiliṅge hanta tarhi vākyaṃ nāma na kiṃ cidapyasti / taducyatām atha vākyaṃ nāma kimiti /	Says the opponent If such collections of words were to be called Direct Assertion and Indicative Power,well, then, there is nothing that can be called a Sentence so will you please explain what a sentence is ? Still with a view to the capability of all the rest being duly differentia ted from Sentence, the Bhashya replies A Sentence consists of a number of words which collectively erpress a certain idea. Though there is no such single object denotable by all the words collectively, yet what is meant is that which is implied or indicated by them.
saṃhatyārthamabhidadhati padāni vākyamiti /	Or, it may mean that a number of words go to form a sentence, when they denote their objects, after having been thrown together, to form a corporate whole, by means of the one single idea that is songht to be indicated by such a whole.
yadyevaṃ tata ubhayorapyudāhṛta yormantrabrāhmaṇayorvākya lakṣaṇayogāt vākyayoriyaṃ saṃpradhāraṇā na śrutiliṅgayoriti /	Objection In that case, inasmuch as both the mantra and the Brahmaṇapassage that have been quoted in the present connection kada ca nastarīrasi etc., and Aindryà gärhyopatyametc. would fulfil the conditions necessary for the sentence, the present discussion would be one about the comparative strength of two Sentences and not of a Direct Assertion and an Indicative Power.

Objection Inasmuch as Declaration, Injunction and Application are all necessarily preceded by a certain Potency, in the case of the sentence Aindryā gärhapatyam etc, also we have an instance of Indica tive Power and not of Direct Assertion exclusively and similarly too, in the case of the Mantra kadã ca etc., we have the Declaration of Indra and as such in this case there can be no differentiation between Direct Assertion and Indicative Power. word Indra to have an Indicative potency, apart from a Direct Asser tion in the form of Declaration.
satyamubhayatrobhayamapyasti /	Reply True in the sentences in question we have a mixture of both Direct Assertion and Indicative Power.
kiṃ tvendryāṅgāīpatyasya noktibhaktyāvagamyate / indrāṅgatvamatiścāsyā nāścaraśrutikāritā yo hi yasyābhidhānāya śakta ityavagamyate /	In the mantra ‘kadã caetc. though Indra is denoted by the word Indra, yet, inasmuch as no use is expressed by the word, we find no operation of Direct Assertion in the pointing out of the use because there is no word in the mantra, on hearing which the listner obtains any idea either of Indra being the Primary or of the Mantra being the Accessory we have in the case of the, sentence Aindryä etc., where the accusative ending in garhapatyam distinctly points to the fact of Garhapatya being the Primary factor, and the Aindri being the Instrumental accessory.
viniyoge 'pyasai/	Objection For the Mantra also, the Indicative Power is assumed on the ground of the direct denotation of its words.
śakto na hyaśakto niyujyate	Because that which is cognized as capable of denoting something, is also recognized as capable of being applied as the incapable could never be applied.
ekatrāsati sāmarthya mantraḥ śeṣobhidhīyate /	In the case of the mantra kadā cu etc., however, we actually perceive a potency of indicat ing Indra and from that we have to proceed to assume that the appli cation of the Mantra is declared or enjoined by the word.
anyatrānuktaśeṣatvaṃ sāmathyeṃ saṃpratīyate	Then again, in the case of syntactical Connection, we find that it neither has the indicative potency, nor does it directly declare the accessory charac ter what is found in it is only a conglomeration of a number of words, bearing some sort of a relation to one another.
arthaṃ prati na sāmathyaṃ na ca śeṣatvamucyate /	That is to say, there is no sentence which is wholly devoid, either of indicative potency, or of direct declaration or of the proximity of other words.

liṅgatvamabhyupetaṃ cedindropasthāna kalpane/	As regards the Garhapatya, we find that, without any indicative power of the Mantra with reference to the garhapatya the application of the Mantra to that is distinctly declared by the Brāhmaṇapassage Aindryā etc..
ubhayatrāpi vākyatvaṃ kathaṃ bhūyovakalpate	And thus it is only natural that we should proceed to consider which of these two has the stronger authority.
yathā śoghrapravṛttitvāliṅgāderbādhikā śrutiḥ /	Some people make the following observations Under the circum stances, the passage of the Bhashya that we have been considering should have been taken before the sentence Lingavākye etc., or as preceding the sentence nātraikaväkyatvätetc. Bhashya, p. , line .
tathaiva viniyogepi saiva pūrvaṃ pravarttate ka cidyasya pramāṇatvaṃ khaśaktairavadhāritam /	Be cause if we once admit of the indicative power of the mantra towards connecting it with the greeting of Indra,then how can we, again, admit both to have the character of the sentence? Consequently the sentence under consideration should have been placed in a place where it has been asserted that there are two sentences.
na hyanyāpekṣayā tasya sā bhaktirapagacchati bādhastu yadi kalpyeta viparītaḥ prasajjate /	We need not attach much importance to the above observations because it is a common thing to find that when there are many objections to be dealt with, the objection that has gone before is refuted at the time of the refutation of that which comes after it.
na hi pūrvamavādhitvā pareṣāṃ janma labhyate	Reply It is not so in the reply the Bhashya brings forward the Direct Assertion of the Garhapatya. Mutual proximity also could not be taken, without contradiction, unless it opposed the said Direct Assertion.
tyādinasamartha viniyogovakalpate /	Says the Bhashya Atha và nätraikaväkyatvatetc. forward the contradiction of the Direct Denotation of the accusative ending.
na sāmarthyādirūpaṃ syādekavākyādibhirvinā	That is to say, if the Accusative ending in garhapatyam had the sense of the Locative or of the Instrumental, then there might not be a contradiction. As a matter of fact, however, it signifies the objective and this is certainly contradicted.

yaḥ parādhīnavṛttiḥ sa taddādhaṃ kathamācaret	Now then, with regard to the six means of knowledge, Direct Assertion and the rest, it has been shown in the preceding Adhikaranas that each of them is a true means within its own limits and none of them ever steps beyond those limits, where it could be suspected of weakness. And when an idea has once been brought about by one of these, it is not possible for it to be made nonexistent. And inasmuch as every one of these ideas is only selfdestructible, it could not be set aside by any other idea.
na śruteviniyoktṛtvaṃ niṅgādhīnaṃ pratīyate /	Nor is it possible for the sanskāru impression of that idea to be removed,as there can be no destruction of the sanskāra that is the source of memory. Nor, lastly, is it possible to separate it from its legitimate effect in the shape of due action as the idea of action is stronglyrooted.
vijñāte viniyoge tu tadvaśācchakti nirṇayaḥ	Consequently, all the six being equally strong in authority, whenever they are found to contradict one another, they must be treated as pointing to optional alterna tives.

liṅgānumānabhūtāyāṃ tāvataiva śrutāvapi	Similarly that which is not found to be related, by Syntactical Connection, with another thing, could never be believed to have any capabilities with regard to that thing.
viniyogābhidhānasya dūratvā hurbalatvadhīḥ /	And when there is such a relationship then the apparent inconsistency of this very relationship establishes the said capability and thus Syntactical Connection would appear to be by far the stronger in authority than Indicative Power, and hence than Direct Assertion.
tacca pūrvānumāyāṃ syānnottaratra kathaṃ cana ekaḍi cicatuḥ pañca vastvantaraṇakaritam /	In the same manner, all Requirements are based upon those that proximate to one another becauso factors that are remote from one another cannot be required by, or related to, one another conse “quently all that has gone before is possible only when there is Proxi mity, which, therefore, in the form of Order, must be regarded as superior to all the four that have gone before.

tatra pūrvottarayorbhāgayorekavākyatvaṃ pratyaścam naikārthābhidhānasāmathyeṃ, bhinnārthābhidhānasāmarthyaṃ tvārthaṃ pratyayadarśanātsivam/	In fact we have explained it more than once that only that much is to be regarded as Vedic which has to be assumed in fulfilment of certain needs of the Veda For these reasons it must be admitted that Direct Assertion is superior in authority to Indicative Power, which is one step further removed from its objective. Because Direct Assertion does not need the help of anything else, in the way that it is itself needed by Indicative Power.
tatra samudāyāvayava viniyogāya vākyasāmarthyayoḥ saha prasthitayorasamarthaviniyogāsaṃbhavādyāvadvākyena pūrvo bhāga uttarārthābhidhānasamartha uttaro vā pūrvasamartha ityanumoyate tāvatpratyeka bhāgavartinā sāmathryena parvasyāpi svārthe para sthāpi svārthe śrutiranumitā tataśca yāvaditaratra viniyojikā śrutyanumānāya prayatyate tāvadiha viniyoge siddhe nirākā satvātprakaraṇāmnānamya na kaścidapi hetuḥ śrutyanumānaityanupajātamūlo viniyogo bādhyate /	To this effect we have the following declaration That which does not stand in need of something else is the stronger of the two while that which has its functioning dependent upon something elsehow could that ever set aside this latter? Thus then, among Direct Assertion and the rest, we find that that which precedes operates independently of that which follows, and is, therefore, stronger than that while that which follows, having its autho rity dependent upon that which precedes it, can never set aside this latter. We have already shown that we cannot adnit of the authority of Indi cative Power and the rest unless they are capable of leading to the inference of a corroborative Direct Assertion. Objection It has also been declared that that which is itself devoid of Power can never be applied to any use even by a hundred Direct Assertions. Reply True this has been declared but it was a most improper declaration because, as a matter of fact, the capability of Direct Assertion to lay down the use of an accessory does depend upon Indicative Power it is after the use has been cognized by means of Direct Assertion, that, upon the strength of that cognition, we come to infer its capability of being used in that way. That is to say, after Direct Assertion has pointed out the use to which the accessory is to be put, there arises the question as to the manner in which it would serve that purpose and the conclusion arrived at is that it would serve it in the way in which it would be capable of doing so and though there may be nothing in the accessory itself that points to its capability for such use as f.i.
mantrasyāpi hi pūrvasya pūrvacāthe śogha viniyoga uttarasya cireṇa /	there is nothing in the Aindrī mantra itself that points to its being used in the greeting of Gärhapatya, yet such capability is inferred from the Direct declaration of the use as in the Injunction Aindryä gärhapatyam upatishthate.
tathottarottarasya śīghra pūrvasya tatra cireṇa /	Reply True so far it is the same in both cases but this is of no use in the matter of the strength or weakness of the two. Because it is only when the idea of the use is remote that there is a notion of weakness and this would apply only to a case where the nonexistent factor has got to be assumed, or inferred, before there is an idea of the use. That is to say, in the case of Indicative Power, there is no pointing out of the use, until there is a prior inference of the Direct Assertion laying down that use and hence in this case there is a certain degree of remoteness, which is not present in the case of Direct Assertion, wherein the declaration of the use having been duly cognized, it is the presence of this use that leads to the inference of the necessary capability and this inference, appearing subsequently, does not remove, to any remote point, the previouslyobtained idea of the use.
śoghraviniyuktaśca mantraściraviniyogamādriyate /	What has been said above holds good respecting all the remaining pairssuch as Indicative Power and Syntactical Connection, Syntactical Connection and Context, Context and Order, and Order and Name.

svapradhānye ca saṃbhavati na paropasarjanatvaṃ pratipadyate tasmāliṅgaṃ bacīya iti bhittvā vākyaṃ viniyoga iti /	That is to say, the operation of Indicative Power is removed by the single step of the inference of a corroborative Direct Assertion, while that of Syntactical Connection is removed by two steps, in the shape of the inference of Indicative Power and Direct Assertion, and so on.
nanvevaṃ sati nirvapāmotyādinā lṛptasāmarthyena śīghutaraprāptenāvaruddherthe vi prakṛṣṭaprāptānāṃ devasya tvetyādīnāṃ bādhādaviniyogaḥ prāpnoti /	For instance in the case of the sentence Kadā ca nastarīrasietc. all the other words, that are not denotative of Indra, being found to be syntactically connected with the word denotativo of that Deity, we come to assume the existence in those words of the power of denoting that deity and this power leads us on to the Direct Assertion i which points out the use to which the mantra is to be put.
na caiṣāṃ bhinnaprayojanatvātmama cayastathā satyekavākyatvābhāvā, davaṇyaṃ caitairyathā kathaṃ cinnirvāpa eva prakāśayitavyaḥ nānyaprakāśanaṃ karmānaṅgatvaprasaṅgāt /	in the sentence Agnaye jushṭam nirvapāmi, the words nirvapāmi and Agni the other words, denoting things not directly connected with the action, appear to be incapable of being of any use in its perform ance and yet the apparent inconsistency of these being syntactically connected leads to the inference of the existence in them of the capability of denoting things connected with the action and consequently they suppress their own original denotations, and then coming to indicate things connected with the action, become capable of being utilized in its performance and then it is that having led to the inference of a Corrobo rative Direct Assertion, they come to be actually utilized in connection with that action.
ataḥ samānatantravārtika /	All this is quite admissible in a case where there is no incompatibility between Syntactical Connection, Indicativo Power and Direct Assertion.
viṣayatvātmamavāye sati vākyaprāpyapadāntarabādhena bhavitavyamiti /	And the sole reason for this is that, while Syntactical Connection is still on its way to the inference of In dicative Power, the already existing Indicative Power hastens to bring about the inference of the corroborative Direct Assertion, and thereby restrict the use to which the sentence is to be put.
yāni hyasamavetārthavacanāni tāni yadi svatantrī kriyante tatonarthakāni bhavanti /	Thus then, in the matter of the appli cation of the whole sentence and its parts, when Syntactical Connection and Indicative Power proceed to point out their uses,inasmuch as that which is devoid of power cannot be applied to any use, while Syntactical Connection is still on the way to the inference of the fact of the latter portion of the sentence being subservient to the purpose of the former, or vice versa, the Indicative Powers belonging to each of these two portions themselves distinctly brings about the inference of a Direct Assertion pointing out the fact of each of the two portions being applied to a distinct purpose of its own.

As for the Muntra also, that which is the first to appear is more quickly applied to the use that is the first to present itself, to which the former Mantra could be applied only very slowly. Similarly that which appears latterly becomes more quickly applied to the use, which is the last to appear.
yathā prakṛtau nirākāṅkṣībhūtā dharmā vikṛtīniyanti tathā ca lṛpta vyākhyātam / tasmādevamādonyapi saṃbaśyante /	Thus then, Indicative Power being stronger than Syntactical Connec tion, the Mantras are to be applied by breaking up the sentence into two distinct parts. Objection Such being the case in the sentence Devasya tva savituḥ…….…..nirva pāmi the word nirvapāmi having its indicative power duly ascertained, and appearing much more quickly, takes up the purpose in question and precludes the application of the remote “words ‘ dēvasya tvã etc., which, for this reason, can not be applied to the same use.
yeṣāṃ tu prakāśyorthaḥ samaveto dṛśyate teṣāmanabhidheyenāsaṃbadhyamānānāmapyarthavattāstīti nānarthakya nimittamavakāśaṃ labhante /	That is to say, those words that do not denote things connected with actions, if these be taken independently by themselves, they become wholly useless. Consequently, even though the object nirvāpa has had all its require ments fulfilled by previously ascertained relationships, yet it becomes denotable by the other words, in case these latter are found to be in need of some such object.

vākyaprakaraṇayoḥ prakaraṇamarthaviprakarṣāddurbalam / tathā hi / pratyakṣā saṃgatirvākye na ca prakaraṇe tyasaiau /	Consequently even such words as are not denotative of things connected with the action come to be so connected and used in accordance with Syntactical Connection. Those words, on the other hand, that are found to denote things connected with actions, have their use, even if they do not happen to be connected with things not denoted by them and they do not obtain a place on the mere ground of their uselessness.
ko 'numātavyā tākā viprakṛṣṭatā	As all the six, Direct Assertion and the rest,if they happen to be tainted by uselessness,are held to be capable of being set aside even by those that are weaker than themselves.
ākāṅkṣātaḥ prabhṛtyekaṃ śrutyarthaṃ prati gacchati / nāmapi tvanyato labdhvā śrutirekasya kalpyate	For instance, though Direct Assertion in the sentence Vrihin prokshati points to the fact of the Prokshana being an accessory attendant upon the form of the corn, yet we lose no time in rejecting this and taking it to be attendant upon the capability of the corn to bring about certain transcendental results,as shown by the Context.
tāhi yatmākṛtāṅgamadhyapātitvena notyannaṃ tatparatātparastādvā avasthitakramabhāgbhavati /	Between Syntactical Connection and Context it is the latter that is the weaker, because of its being further remote from its object. We find that the connection or relationship between the Accessory and its Primary is distinctly perceptible in a case of Syntactical Connection while in that of Context it is not so perceptible, but has got to be inferred from mutual requirement and this constitutes a remote ness.

In the same manner, between Context and Order or Position, it is the latter that is the further remote from its objective.
netadevam	Because while one i.e.
arthānāṃ prathamaṃ kena citprakāreṇānavagatasaṃbandhānāṃ samā khyā pravarttate / sā ca śeṣaśeṣitvaṃ tāvannaiva pratipādayati kena citmaṃbandhenopapadyamānatvātsaṃbandhamātramapi naivābhidhatte /	the Context, on its way to the assumption of the corroborative Direct Declaration, begins with Mutual Requirement upon which the Context is directly based, the other i.e. Order has got to obtain this Requirement also from another source, and then, through that, reach the corroborative Declaration. That is to say, Order or Position consists merely in the fact of the two the Accessory and the Primary being mentioned or performed in the same place and in a case where the two things thus occurring in the same place, happen to be in mutual need, we have an instance of Context.
nahi yaugikaiḥ saṃbandhobhidhīyataityuktam /	As instances in point we have those modificatory sacrifices that happen to be montioned in an extensive Context.
samākhyā 'nyathānupapacyā 'numīyate saṃvandhamānasya caitadrūpaṃ kiṃ cidabhinnameṣāmastotyavagamaḥ tataścāpannaṃ kramājjaghanyatvam / na hi kiṃ cittatra sāmānya manumātavyaṃ deśasāmānyasya pratyakṣatvāt iha tu tatyadasyāpratyakṣatvādānumānikatva miti viprakarṣaḥ /	From among these, that which has not originally laid down as falling in the midst of the accessories of the Original sacrifice, is found to be mentioned either before or after this latter and thereby becomes subject to the operations of Order. In the case of Context, on the other hand, all requirements having been fully falfilled by the accessories mentioned along with the Original sacrifice which have had their uses distinctly defined, if there is an acces sory which happens to be mentioned near something that has all its needs supplied, as also near another thing that stands in some need, and thereby comes to be simultaneously taken up by both of these,then, while it would be still giving rise to the necessary assumption of a require ment of that which is in proximity to it and hence connectible to it by Order, it would become syntactically connected with that which already has such a requirement, and as such, is connectible with it by Context.
yāvacca kiṃ citmāmānyamapecā kalpayati tāvaditaracaikavākyatā klṛptā tathā yāvadiaareer bhavati tāvaditaracopakāra sāmarthyasiddhiḥ /	And while in the former case, we reach the assumption of Syntactical Connection, there already appears, in the latter case, the assumption of the Power, in the Accessory, to help that with which it is related by Context.
yāvavedopakārasāmarthya kalpanā tāvadinaregā śrutirutpāditā /	And while, in the former case, there is an assumption of the said Power, we have, in the latter, the assumption of the corroborative Direct Declaration.
tataśca yāvadica śrutimanumātumupakramate tāvaditaratra vi niyoge siddhe nirākāhībhūte prakaraṇapāṭhe sarvametatpracitamapyaripakavicchedādāma sadhyamiva nūnaṃ nirvāṇaṃ bhavati /	And lastly, while, in the former case, we shall be assuming the Corroborative Declaration, the already assumed Declaration, in the latter case, would have distinctly established the application of the accessory in question and all the rest would thereby become wholly inoperative. Similarly too, between Order and Name, we find that in the case of the former, the mutual relationship of the Primary and the Accessory, assumed on the ground of their occurring in the same place, is still based always based upon some sort of an identity whereas in the case of Name, there is no such identity of place pointed out by the Veda as would establish the possibility of a direct relationship.
tasmādarthaviprakarṣāta paraṃ paraṃ bādhyataiti siddham āha ca	Objection The Name directly denotes relationship itself and operating thereby, it would come to be equal to Direct Assertion, in authority.
ekamopānava ko bhūmiṣṭhāparastayoḥ / ubhayośca javastulyaḥ pratibandhaśca nāntarā	ing literally do not denote any relationship. And every relationship is in the form that the two objects related have something in common between themselves.
tena yadyapi sāmathyaṃ pratyekaṃ siddhamanyadā /	Thus then, it becomes established that Name is inferior to Order. Because in the case of the latter, the common element has not got to be inferred, as the fact of their place being common is distinctly perceptible while in the case of the former, there being no word expressive of any common element directly perceptible, it has got to be inferred and this constitutes a remoteness from the real objective.
tathāpi yugapagāve jaghanyasya nirākriyā	And thereby the mention in the Context having had all its requirements fulfilled, all that follows it, even though pointed out by the right means of knowledge, be comes like the unripe seed plucked from the tree, and as such incapable of bringing forth any proper fruit. In support of this we have the following declaration When there is a single fruit that is reached by a flight of stairs, and which is acquired by mere approach, and for reaching it two men contend ing for its possession start up, both equally fast and free from obstacles. but one of them starts from the ground, while the other starts from one step of the stairs already gained,then, there is no doubt that the latter one will reach the fruit first and the fruit having been taken away by that man, the other would get down without having obtained anything. And in this case we find that though each of the men had power enough for obtaining the fruit at another time, yet when put together, the younger manthe one that is a step behindis always vanquished. are And as a matter of fact, we find that it is in one way that operations on even by weak agencies, when there is no force to contend carried with while the character of the operation becomes wholly different when there is an inroad of more powerful agencies, which destroys all the strength of the weaker ones.
tasmātraitadālambanaṃ yuktaṃ yat ka ciduttareṣāṃ prāmāṇya mi ṭaṃ tasmāilavadvirodhepi tena bhavitavyamiti /	For these reasons, it is by no means reason able to hold that simply because the latter means of knowledge Indica tive Power and the rest are held to be authoritative in one place, they must be so also when they are opposed by stronger and more authorita tive means of knowledge Direct Assertion f.i..
yattu pramāṇābhāso bādhyate na pramāṇamiti tatra brūmo 'yamapi pramāṇābhāsa eva /	It has been argued above that it is only a false semblance of authoritative means of knowledge that can be set aside, and not what is a real means of knowledge. And in reply to this we say that in the cases under consideration what are set aside are really mere semblances of authoritative means.
katham	Because in these cases i.e.
na hi yatra viṣaye bādhastatraiṣāṃ pramāṇatvam/ kiṃ tarhi prade śāntare kevanānāmupanaścitaṃ sāmānyato dṛṣṭarūpeṇācāpi pratibhāti /	where there is a more authoritative means to the con trary, those that are set aside have never had any authority. There was only a semblance of authority assumed from the fact of their having been perceived to have an authority in other cases. That is to say, no authority attaches to these other means of know ledge, in a case where they are set aside the fact is that having, in another place, been found to have proper authority, wherein they appear by themselves, they are inferred, from that, to have an authority, even in the cases under consideration.
tattu bannīyasā 'pahṛtaviṣayatvātmīdatīti paścā bhrāntitvenādhyavasauyate /	But inasmuch as they are ejected by other superior means of knowledge, they fail in their purpose, and are therefore concluded to be wrong and mistaken.
atha vā yastatrāsya vyāpāra āmī tamihāpi prakramataeva / sa tu javavatānyena viṣaye 'pahate mūlacchedādyadā taṃ na gacchati tatkiṃkriyatāṃ tena bhu gatṛṣṇāḍhivadevāprāpya pramāṇameva bādhyate /	Though it begins its operations with the same functions that belonged to it previously, yet, inasmuch as its objective has been wrested by another means very much quicker in its operations, and thereby, having its very root cut off from under itself, it does not reach its end consequently, what else could we do, but set aside its authority, rejecting it as a mirage ? In all such cases, the idea of accessory character is rejected, before it has come into existence, as there has been no Direct Assertion yet assumed pointing to such character,such rejection being done by the assumption of the falsity of all intervening cognitions brought about by the former and thus there can be no similarity in strength between the two, on the ground of the similarity of their appearance.
rocchedanādirūpo bādho naivāśaṅkitavyaḥ /	For this reason, the rejection in question should not be mistaken for one in the form of the setting aside of a mixture of the two cognitions.
yo 'pi co tpannavādhaḥ tamapi phanlaviyogātmanopapādayiṣyāmaḥ /	The rejection of that which has come into existence, is in the form of the setting aside of its consequences, and will be treated of later on in Adhyāya X.
evaṃ tāvad dvayordvayorbirodhe varṇitam arthasiddhatvāttu bhāṣyakāraṇetaraiḥ saha na pradarśitaṃ vyākhyādabhistvevaṃ prapañcayitavyam /	Thus then we have explained what happens in the case of conflict between any two of the six means of knowledge. Inasmuch as the case of the conflict of one by two or more, is similar to what has been ex plained, the Bhashya has not treated of it separately. But it is neces sary for the Commentators to explain those cases also in detail and this is to be done in the following manner When there is a conflict between Direct Assertion and Syntacti cal Connection,e.g.
yathā śrutivākyayorvirodhe aruṇādirvākyasāmarthyādānantaryasāmānādhikaraṇyāgyā meka cāyanyā diśeṣatvaṃ prāpnuvattṛtīyā śrutyā krayasaṃbandhitvena vijñāyate dvitīyasopānabhūgatārohakayoriva chātra yāvadvākyaṃ sāmarthya kalpayati tā vacchrutyā viniyogaḥ kalpita iti mahadantaram /	in the case of the sentence arunaya pingakshya,etc. the Redness,etc. are shown, by the indicative power of Syntac tical Connection and by coextensiveness, to belong to the oneyearold cow while the Instrumental ending directly declares it to belong to the Purchase, we find that while Syntactical Connection is still on the ground, Direct Assertion is already two steps nearer the goal and hence while the former is still on its way to the assumption of Indicative Power, the Direct Assertion will have established the use to which the accessory is to be put and this constitutes a great difference between the opera tions of the two. When there is conflict between Direct Assertion and Context, as when the twentyone recitatious are shown by the Context belong to the DarçaPūrṇamāsa, while the Direct Assertion contained in ‘Pratishṭhākāmasyaikarimiçatirannbruyāt makes them accessory to a certain end desired by the Agent,it is the Context that is always set aside.
anuvacanānāṃ ca kriyātmakatvāditikarttavyatāmṛpatvātprakaraṇagrāhyatvena tadvirodhodāharaṇatvaṃ timra eva sānhasyopasado dvādaśāhīnasyeti tu dvādaśavasyākriyātvāḍha nitikarttavyatā sati kathaṃbhāvarūpaprakaraṇagrāhyatvānapapatteḥ sannidhimātreṇa prakaraṇākalapanāpūrvaka saṃbandhādhyavasānācchu tisthāna birodhodāharaṇatvaṃ yuktamityeke /	The recitations too having the nature of actions, and thus forming part of the Procedure, are subject to the specific authority of the Context and as such they have been cited here as examples. Procedure, it cannot be subject to the authority of Context, which is based upon the Procedure and it is only by means of Proximity that it comes to be accepted, through the assumed agency of the Context conse quently, this must be regarded as an instance of conflict of Direct Asser tion and Position or Order. But this is scarcely admissible because if the number Twelve in question had belonged to the substance used at the sacrifice, or had been an independent factor by itself, then alone it could not be taken as part of the Procedure, being entirely devoid of the form of an action. As a matter of fact, inasmuch as we have the injunction of twelve with distinct reference to the action of upasad, which latter distinctly forms part of the Procedure, the said number cannot but be contained in the Procedure. And in this case while the upasad contained in the Procedure would be assuming the Syntactical Connection and Indicative Power of the number, the Direct Declaration by the genitive ending in ‘ahīnasyu will have established the fact of its belonging to the Ahina and this Ahina is nothing other than the Ahargana.
ta na naivamāśritam /	Consequently this would be a case of the setting aside of the Context by Direct Assertion.
kutaḥ itikarttavyatāṃśasthāṃ yenoddiśyopasatkriyām / hāḍhaśatva vidhistena kathaṃbhāvena gṛhyate	Question What, then, is the example of conflict between Direct Assertion and Order? Answer The qualifications of the Rope used for tying round the sacrificial Postc.g. the being made of grass and the likewould be shown by Order to belong to the Agnishomiya animal while by Direct Assertion they are shown to belong to the Post.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda / tāvatpratyakṣayā śrutyā ṣaṇyaṃ hīnāṅgatāṃ gatā / neva hyahargaṇādanyadahānyādīnamacyate	As it is clearly perceptible, by Direct Assertion, that the Rope is accessory to the Tying of the Post and hence together with its qualifications, it cannot belong to the Animal. Because while the Order or Position would be assuming the corroborative Context and the rest,thus separated from its objective by four inter vening steps, it will have been defeated by the said Direct Assertion. And while the Order would be engaged in assuming the existence of mutual Requirement alone which would be the basis of the Context, its objective, the Rope, before it was reached by the said Order, would be taken up by Direct Assertion.
etapaparitryāṇaśeṣo hi ramanā śrutā /	As an instance of the conflict between Direct Assertion and Name, we have the following We find the mantra ‘īkhē tvāetc. mentioned in the chapter on DarçaPurnamasa called by the name of Pauradaçiku chapter chapter devoted to the Purodaçaofferings, and occurring in a Context common to all the other sacrificial materials the Sānnayya etc., not having its application pointed out by any clear Indicative Power and at first sight, the name of the chapter would show it to belong to the Purodaça only while the Direct Assertion contained in the Brahmanasentence ikhe tvēti çakhan chinatti distinctly points it out as pertaining to the cutting of the twig required for the making of the Sānnāyyā.
saha dharmenasā yāti krameṇa paśuśeṣatām ākāṅkṣāmātramevaikaṃ yāvatkalpayati kramaḥ /	And while the Name would be still engaged in assuming a common element, the Direct Assertion will have estab lished the use to which the Mantra is to be put, long before the former has had time to assume the intermediate corroborations of the Context, Syntac tical Connection, Indicative Power and Direct Assertion and as such it is set aside by the aforesaid Direct Assertion.
dūreṇa tāvadaprāptāṃ ramanāṃ harati śrutiḥ	But the Indicative Power of the words of the Mantras themselves point to the contrary procedure.
vacanāttvayathārthamendrī syāditivat balavattaraśrutikṛta viniyoga kalpita jaṇādāṇāgnīṣomīyāṅgatvādevaṃ hyāda	Consequently, while the said Position or Order would assume the Context and the necessary Syntactical Connection, the Indicative Power would have assumed its corroborative Direct Assertion and definitely established the applicability of the mantras and thus we have the rejection of Order long before it has had time to assume the Corroborative Indicative Power and Direct Assertion. We have another instance of conflict between Indicative Power and Order in regard to the mantras Parivirasi,etc. and yuva suvāsā,etc. which are respectively descriptive of the karaṇa and the kriyamāṇa of the Parivyana winding.
anādiśrutvā liṅgenotkṛṣyamāṇā manotā vāritā dvidevatye 'pyekadaivatyaiva na kevanāgni daivatyatvenāgnīṣomīyāduttāraṇīyetyarthaḥ /	And this Direct Assertion stands in the way of any Indicative Power applying the Manota to any other animal the sense of the Assertion being that even when the animal is dedicated to two deities, the Manotā to be employed should be that pertaining to the single Deity of Agni, and it should not, on the more ground of its pertaining to that single Deity, be disjoined from the anima! Agnishomiya dedicated to the two deities of Agni and Soma.
yadvaivakāraṃ svasthānādapanīya yathākramaṃ kāryaivetyatra saṃyojanā kāryavyavadhāryate /	Or again, we can take the word êva differently, and explain the Assertion to mean that the Manota should be applied in the same order in which it occurs.
liṅga samākhyāvirodhe tu bhakṣānuvāke grahaṇādivākyāni samākhyānācāṅgatvena saṃbandhasāmānyādikalpanayā bhakṣāṅgatva viniyogāya prasthitāni liṅgena grahaṇāvekṣaṇasamyakkarahyeṣu viniyujyantaiti sthitam /	As an example of conflict between Indicative Power and Name, we have the Bhakshānuvāka, which contains sentences expressive of holding,etc. these sentences begin to be used as auxiliaries to the eating, on account of the Name Bhakshānuvāka pointing to the fact of their bearing a common relationship to the whole anuväka but before they come to be thus used, the words of the mantra indicate the applicability of its various parts to the actions of holding, looking and proper digestiny, to which use, therefore, they come to be put. In the same manner, the Manuverses, as well as the Prthupājavati verses, come, by their Indicative Power, to be applied as Sõmidhēnis, rejecting, thereby, the indications of the name yajyä. As an instance of conflict between Syntactical Connection and Order, we have the case of the words other than Parivita and Pari virasi which are descriptive of the windingviz.
yā jyāsamākhyābādhena ca manohacāṃ pṛthupājavatyośca liṅge'na sāmidhenītvena viniyoga ityuktam / vākyakramayorvirodhe tṛtīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	Objection This that you have explained would be an instance of the superiority of Direct Assertion and not of Syntactical Connec tion. Reply The indication in question is not due to any particular word of the mantra, as the Injunctive affix does not denote the agent it is got at by means of a coordination based upon the indications due to the proximity of two words which constitutes Syntactical Connection and hence it is a case of the supersession of Name by Syntactical Connee tion. As an instance of Conflict between Context and Name, we have the case of the Prayājas, that are mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa named the Paurodiçika, which though, by the name, belonging to the Purodāça sacrifice are applied to the Sännāyyā Upāmçusucrifice, as shown by the Context.
parivyāṇakaraṇakriyamāṇānuvādiparivīra siparivītapadavyatiriṛpadānāṃ yuvā suvāsā śrāgāt sa u śreyānityevamādīnāṃ liṅgaviniyukta parivītapaढ़kavākyatvātmavanīyaparivyāṇe viniyogaḥ / vākya samākhyayorvirodhaṃ bhavānuvāka eva sadhyāsamityevamādiṣu grahaṇādā viniyujyamāneṣu tadekavākyagataśeṣapaḍhāvṛttiruḍhāharttavyā	As an example of conflict between Indicative Power and Syntactical Connection, we have the mantra ‘Syonuntē etc., wherein by Syntactical Connection the whole mantrafrom the very beginning is shown to pertain to the action of seating or depositing the Purodaça while Indicative Power points only to the part tasmin sīda as the mantra pertaining to that action. In the same manner, Syntactical Connec tion connects the portion tasmin sida with the action of Abhighūraṇa Pouring of ghee over the grassbedding, while Indicative Power points to Syonante......kalpayami only as belonging to that action and the former is accordingly set aside. These mantras have been cited, on a previous occasion, as affording an instance of a single accessory belonging to several Primaries, while on the present occasion they are cited as one of several Accessories belonging to a single Primary. That is to say, on the previous occasion we had Syntactical Connection pointing to the fact of the mantra synonanteetc. belonging to the Depositing together with the Abhigharaṇa, while Indicative Power connected it with the Depositing alone and while the former indicated the mantra tasmin sīda as belonging to the Abhighāraṇa, Indicative Power showed it to belong to the Depositing, in connection with which it is actually used on the present occasion, on the other hand, we have Syntactical Connection indicating the fact of the two mantras pertaining to each of the two actions Depositing and Abhigharaṇa, while Indicative Power connects only one mantra with each action.
śrutisamākhyā virodhe vājapeyaḥ samākhyānātprāpnotyadhvaryu karttṛkaḥ /	Consequently while the Order in question would be engaged in assuming a mutnal requirement and the consequent Syntactical Connection, the Syntactical Connection will have established the application, by means of a prior assumption of Power,etc. based upon of immediate Proximity and the sameness of caseendings.
tyā svārājyakāmasya tathādhvaryornirākriyā	Consequently this latter is possessed of the greater authority.
pūrve syonaṃ taityādi sadane sābhighāraṇe / vākyenāṅgatayā prāptaṃ liṅgācchuddhe 'bhidhāraṇe /	As an example of conflict between Context and Order, we have the use of the word girà and irā in regard to the Hymn. In the Agnish toma Sama, the word to be used is indicated by Order to begira while Context points it out to be ira and certainly this latter is stronger in its authority. On the former occasion we had cited the case of the words with regard to the Sama while the present is with reference to the Stotra, consequently the two cannot be said to be mixed up.
tasminsodetyayaṃ vākyātprāptaḥ śeṣo 'bhidhāraṇe /	This same example had been cited above! but that was with reference to the form of the Addressing of the Directions itself.
liṅgāttu sadanasyaiva tatraivātaḥ prayujyate	As for the Indicative Power of the Mantras themselves, it lends its support to both alternatives consequently, the case is one of conflict between Name and Order..
ekasminneva mārge tu yatsaṃkīrṇacatuṣṭayam /	We have considered the cases of the collision or conflict of Direct Assertion and the rest, when the Accessory, as also the Primary, is one only.
bhāṣa bhāṣyakāreṇa vivektavyaṃ tadātmanā	The comparative strength or weakness in these cases is based upon the doubtful character or otherwise of the declarations made.
tathā paśvaṅga mekatvaṃ padaśrutyā pratīyate /	Similarly we can cite instances of conflicts between two Direct Assertions, in regard to preceder ce, to subsidiaries and accessories, etc.,etc. For instance, the word paçuna in paçuna yajeta directly asserts the fact of the Singularity being an Accessory of the animal while the stronger agency of the common caseending declares it to belong to the Action. the Injunctive affix makes out the end desired by man to be the required objective.
samāna pratyayaśrutyā bannīyasyā kriyāṅgatā /	As an instance of conflict between two Indicative Powers, we, have the case of the mantra ‘syonantē sadanam kṛnomi.
tathā dhātvartha karmatve pāda bhāvanāyā vidhiśrutyā puruṣārthasya mādhyatā	As for instance, the Direct Assertion pertaining to the modificatory sacrifices, through Implication, are rejected by those applying to them, perceptibly or directly. In these cases however, the order of strength is sometimes the other way,f.i.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda / durbalasya pramāṇasya banavānāśrayo yadā /	tible Indicative Power as in the case of the kṛshṇala rice made of gold the threshing pointed out by the Direct Assertion Vrihinavahanti, which has a real existence, but is applied to the krshnala only by implication is set aside by the Capability of the golden Rice of not being threshed.
tadāpi viparītatvaṃ śiṣṭākope yathoditam	Similarly too, when the weaker means of knowledge has a very strong support, then too the effect of rejection is reversed, as has been explained under the Sūtras Iiii et seq.
tathā ca loka /	That is to say, of all means of knowledge, the contradiction lies in their objects, and not in their forms.
durbalairapi bādhyante puruṣaiḥ pārthivāśritaiḥ	ing Even though the people of the town are very strong in their combination, yet they are successfully repressed by a handful of men, who have the support of the kings authority.
tatra tulyavanatvoktiḥ svataḥ prāmāṇya vibhramāt / pradeśāntaradṛṣṭaṃ ca rūpaṃ tulyaṃ dvayorapi	We now proceed with the explanation of the remaining portion of the Bhashya. Tulyabalē ētē kāraṇē, idamapi karaṇam idamapi, grutirapi lingamapi,etc. C This assertion of the equality of strength is based upon the convic tion that every portion of the Veda is equally selfsufficient in its authority specially as both Direct Assertion and Indicative Power are found to have equal authority in cases where each appears by itself.
na hi vijñānasya vijñānasya ca viśeṣa upalabhyataiti/	Says the BhashyaNa hi vijnānasya vijnānasya viçēsha upalabhyatē.

As a matter of fact, even Direct Assertion cannot point out the use to which a mantra is to be put, until the form of the mantra has been fully recognized consequently it is always necessary to ascertain, beforehand, the form of the mantra and at the time that the mantra in question is ascertained, there at once arises the idea that it is to be employed in the hymning of Indra and this idea can never be set aside.

For these two reasons of transience and delay in operations, no selfsufficient authority can belong to Indica tive Power. The reply to this objection is based upon the fact of the bringing about of conviction being equally present in the case of Indicative Power, as also upon the notion that by savicikitsa the objector means the presence of Doubt, mistake or uncertainty.
itarastu svābhipretamevaṃ savicikitsatvaṃ gṛhītvā caivaṃ ca sati naiva liṅgaṃ nāma kiṃ citpramāṇamabhaviṣyaditi /	That Indi cative Power, however, which brings about a certain conviction, that the mantra belongs to such and such a Deity, is equal to Direct Declaration in its authority, and as such must be taken as laying down an optional alternative. “Objection ‘nanu naiva kadācit,etc. That is to say, as shown before, the Indicative Power is never without delay in its operations.

The Siddhanti retorts If the mere fact of being delayed in its operations were to so much disturb the nature of Indicative Power as to make it relinquish all authority, then, let it be devoid of all authority, as there certainly is a doubt in connection with objects pointed out by Indicative Power.
kathaṃ vā liṅga parijñātatvaṃ siddhavaḍhabhidhoyate / neṣa doṣo liṅgaparijñātatvaṃ tāvadavirodhavejābhiprāyaṃ saṃdigdhatvaṃ virodhavelāyām yadavirodhakāle liṅgasyāvagataṃ viniyojakatvaṃ tanna tathaiva sarvatraivāvatiṣṭhate kiṃ tarhi saṃdihyate anyatrāvirodhādviniyogoṅgokṛtaḥ sa iha kiṃ tathaiva bhavatyatha kena ciyāvarttivyataiti /	Now, how is it that you have given up the declaring of Indicative Power being delayed in its operations, and yet come to speak of it as doubtful? How, too, is it that at the same time, you speak of the object. being cognized by Indicative Power, as an established fact? This does not affect our position, says the Siddhānti as the declaration of the fact of the object being cognized by Indicative Power is with reference to the case wherein there is no contradiction of the more authoritative means of knowledge whereas the declaration of its doubtful character refers to that case wherein there is such a contradic tion. That is to say, the Power of indicating the use of a mantra that is perceived in a case of noncontradiction, does not remain intact in all cases and in many cases, it remains doubtful.
yadi vā vispaṣṭamevāprāmāṇya miti tāvadeva saṃdeho bhavati /	in corroboration of the Indicative Power, and so the Indicative Power to the contrary loses all its significance.
yāvatpratyakṣā śrutirdevalabhyate tasyāṃ tu satyāmitara kalpanānupapatteraprāmāṇyam na cānuktasya kriyāyāṃ prāmāṇyamasti /	In Indicative Power, all that is perceptible is mere capability but this is not enough to point out the use of the mantra and that which is not clearly expressed can have no authority in the matter of Actions,e.g.
yathā satyapi mā madhye viprarājanyau na vaiśyastomaṃ kurutaḥ tasmānna liṅgaṃ vinitṛtīyādhyāpasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda /	even though they have the power, yet the Brāhmaṇa and the Kshattriya do not perform the Vaiçya stoma sacrifice. For these reasons, you must admit that Indicative Power is not a means of pointing out the use of mantras.
prakaraṇavato 'rthasya sannidhāne yamarthamāmanantīti tadetadapi vā prayogasāmarthyānmantrobhidhānavācī syādityanā viśiṣṭastu vākyārtha ityatra varṇitam /	The reply given to the above is in neglect of the fact of the declara tion of the Siddhanti with regard to the nonauthoritative character of Indicative Power being in reference to the case of contradiction, and in fear of the declaration being one of its universal absolute nonauthori tative character and hence it is shown in what way the authoritative character of Indicative Power can be established when a certain fact is mentioned in proximity to a certain thing in the context, the former is “ believed to be instrumental in the accomplishment of the latter and then there arises the question as to how it helps in its fulfilment and the answer to this question is settled by the capability of that thing.
atha vā siddhāntavādināpi virodhe sukhataramapramāṇatvaṃ vacyāmīti manyamānena prathamaṃ svatantrameva māvadaprāmāṇyaṃ darśitam /	Or, the sense of the aforesaid declaration of the Siddhanti may be this In the case of contradiction, the nonauthoritativeness of Indica tive Power would be easily established consequently at the outset we have shown the nonauthoritative character of Indicative Power, in dependently by itself.
tathā ca kṛte svayamevaitasya śrutyanumānadvāraprāmāṇya kalpanamāpatsyate	This being done, we shall make our opponent. himself establish the fact of its authoritative character being based upon the inference of a corroborative Direct Assertion. And this done, he would be easily vanquished by us.
tadyathopadeśātideśābhyāṃ prayājādyupakārasya prakṛtivikṛtyarthatvādavirodhaḥ sakucca tasyāmakṛtkaraṇe'pi pradhānānurodhana guṇānuvṛtteḥ sarvatreṣṭatvādindraśabdasya gārhapatye gauṇatvāḍhavayava prasiddhevendra mukhyatvātsamudāyaprasiddhervirodha iti cenna /	And in reply to this it has been declared that there is distinct authoritativeness, and hence the two are equal in authority and no attention has been paid to the declaration of the condition of the presence of contradiction. Even granting, for the sake of argument, that there is difference in the authoritativeness of Indicative Power and Direct Assertion, there can be no setting aside of the one by the other, simply because there is no contradiction between the two. For instance, the help accorded by the Prayājas being, both by Direct Declaration and Indirect Implication, pointed out as helping both the Primary sacrifice and its modifications, there is no contradictionspecially as it is only desirable that, even when that which is mentioned once is performed over and over again, there should be a repetition of the subsidiaries, in accordance with the Primary. Objection Inasmuch as the word Indra can apply to the Garhapatya ɔnly indirectly, and the literal signification of the word “ Indra applies directly to Indra, there is a contradiction of the signi fication of the word as a whole if the word Indra is taken as signifying the Garhapatya fire.
prayogabhedena parihārādyugapadupadiśyamānaṃ hyetatsaṃbhavāsaṃbhavāśrayādvirudhyate	Reply Not so because the seeming contradiction can be very easily explained away, with reference to different uses of the mantru in question. It is only if the mantra were pointed out as to be used in two different ways, at one and the same time,that there would have been a contradiction, because of the impossibility and possibility of usage being in that case simultaneous.
mantroyaṃ gāīpatyāṅga śabdenaivābhidhīyate / indrāṅgatvaṃ tu sāmathyādaśabdamanumīyate	Direct Declaration is stronger than Indicative Power because that the mantra Aindri belongs to the Garhapatya is mentioned directly by the word in Aindryā gārhapatyamupatishthatë whereas the fact of its belonging to Indra is only inferred from the Power of the word Indra in the muntra, and is not mentioned directly by any words.
parastu sārvatrikameva stiṅgasyāśābdatvamuktamiti manyamāno na tarhi virodhādvāghaḥ kiṃ ta tantravārtika / rhāpramāṇatvādeveti vivakṣanyadyevamityāha /	The opponent thinks that the Siddhanti has declared the universal or absolute nonauthoritativeness of Indicative Power, and thence its rejection is due, not to contradiction, but to its inherent nonauthoritativeness and with this in view he argues as follows If what you say is correct, then even in a case where there is no contradictory Direct Declaration, there can be no cognition of anything obtained from Indicative Power, and hence this latter “would have no authority even in such cases of noncontradiction.
siddhāntavādī tu yathā prathamaṃ pūrvapaścavādinā liṅgasya prāmāṇyamuktamāsīttathedānīṃ svayaṃ pratipādayati /	In reply to this, the Siddhānti proceeds to establish the authoritative ness of Indicative Power in the way that it has been done by the oppon ent himself, in course of the above Purvapaksha.
bhavati hi prakaraṇādeṣortho yathā śaknu yāttathā yāgasyānenopakuryāditi/ na ca svārthābhidhānā danya thā śaknotyasāvupakarttumiti tatra viniyogasvodito bhavati/	That is to say, this much is clear from the Context, that the mantra should help in the sacrifice in the way in which it is capable of doing so and as a matter of fact, apart from the denotation of its meaning, there is no other way in which it could be able to help and hence the said capability comes to point to the use to which the mantra is to be put. The opponent thinks that the Siddhanti has admitted his own stand point, and as such he could not escape from its necessary consequence, in the shape of an admission of the Pürvapaksha view encouraged by this prospect, he retorts If the Capability is based upon Direct Declaration, then, in that case, it could not be rejected by another Declaration.
yadi śrutimū na śrutyantareṇa bādhituṃ śakyaḥ tena yadi tāvadaśābdoyamarthastato naiva pramāṇam/	That is to say, it must be admitted that if what is pointed out by Indicative Power is not supported by the authority of the words of the Veda then it can have no authority but if it has the authority of the words, then it is equal in authority to any Direct Declaration.
atha śābdastatastulyabala iti /	It is for this reason that Indicative Power is weaker than Direct Declaration.
siddhāntavādī tu iyamapi pariharati nāpīti anumānikyāḥ śruteravirodhe satyātmanābho virodhe cānutpādādyatra hi pratyakṣā śrutyā mantro na viniyogaṃ prati nirākāśīkṛta stanāsya viniyogasihyarthaṃ yāvatkalapyate tatsarvamāmnānānyathānupapattimu drāmudritatvādvaidikaṃ bhavati	That is to say, it is a wellknown fact that that which is enjoined should be carried into action, and that which is not enjoined should not be so carried and the above procedure would be directly contradictory to both of these. For these reasons, we cannot admit of an option. With a view to set aside the seeming contradiction, it has been suggested that both should be followed conjointly. But in reply to this we declare that there actually is a contradiction because Direct Declara tion, in the case in question, has fulfilled all the requirements of the Mantra and the Context and as for the Indicative Power, its object is distinctly deficient in certain elements and it is certainly contradicted by the aforesaid Direct Declaration, which does not leave any deficiency in the object in question.
sarvacaiva vikalpānāmanyāyyatvamavasthitam /	Lastly, if we were to admit both simultaneously, then that would involve a selfcontradiction, in that there would be, and at the same time not be, certain requirements unfulfilled.
pakṣe hi sadasadbhāvāvekatrārthe durāśrayai	As a matter of fact, however, there is a vast difference in the character of the two Means of knowledge in question,in that Direct Declaration is very much quicker in its operation.
śrutyā catra nirākāī mantraprakaraṇe kṛte /	Conse quently when once the mantra has had its use pointed out by Direct Declaration, there is no room for the functioning of Indicative Power. And thus the superior authority of Direct Declaration becomes estab lished.
liṅgaṃ sākāṅkṣasādhyārthaṃ tayaikāntāhirudhyate sūtreṇa paradaurbalye sūtrite sati bhāṣyakṛt / ārthaṃ pūrvavalīyastvaṃ vyācaṣṭe tadanādarāt	the Bhashya speaks of the strength of the preceding, which is implied in what the sûtra has said and by this the Bhashyu has shown that much significance cannot be attached to the actual words of the sutra. Of the conflict between Syntactical Connection and Indicative Power we have yet another example in the following In connection with the Jyotishtoma, we have certain Directions, mentioned in the Hautra section and these are enjoined as belonging to to be addressed by the Maitrā varuņa, by Syntactical Connection, in the sentence Tasman maitrā varu paḥ preshyuti canucahēti. But among these Directions we meet with one, in the form Praçāstaryaja and the Indicative Power of this sentence distinctly points to the fact of Maitrāvaruņa being the priest to whom this Direction is addressed.
tatra yadi vākyaṃ balīyastato maitrāvaruṇaḥ preṣyetyātmani ca praiṣāsaṃbhavādbotā yajedatha tu liṅgaṃ balīyasto mantreṇa maitrāvaruṇo niyoktavyaḥ sāmānyasamākhyayā pūrvamayaṃ hotureva prāpitaḥ sanvākyena bādhita ā sottadyadā vākyaṃ liṅgena bādhyate tadā samākhyayaiva pratiprasūtathā choṭakarṭakatvaṃ vijñāyate	Now then, if Syntactical Connection. had the greater authority, then, in the case of the latter Direction also, Maiträvaruṇa would be the priest who would address it and as the addressing of a Direction to ones own self would be impossible, the sacri ficing spoken of in Praçãstaryaja would have to be done by the Hoty priest. Whereas if Indicative Power were possessed of the superior authority, then, the Direction in question would have to be used in directing the Maiträvaruna priest and as he could not be directed by himself, it would have to be done by another person and this Director is known in the manner shown under the Sutra Tesham yato viçeshaḥ syat By the common Name of Hautra it is, in the first instance, indicated that the mantra in question belonged to the Hot! priest but this is set aside by Syntactical Connection and when this Syntactical Connection is, in its turn, set aside by the said Indicative Power, then it is the aforesaid Name itself that reverts to its work and points to the Hotṛ priest as the person who should address the Direction in question and as for the Maiträvaruṇa priest, he is recognized as the person carrying out the Direction addressed. Though the sentence Tasmin maiträvarunaḥ,etc. occurs in the Brāhmaṇa aud as such is capable of the authority of Direct Declaration, yet, inasmuch as it merely consists of a conglomeration of words, it has not the character of Direct Declaration and as such, it is set aside by the Indicative Power, which has its corroborative Direct Declaration in close proximity to it.
yadi hi maitrāvaruṇaḥ prathyettataḥ praśāstuśabdo hotaryanarthakaḥ syāt	If the Maitrāvaruņa priest were to address the Direction, then, in that case, the word Praçastaḥ in ‘Praçastaryaja would be wholly meaningless with regard to the Hotr priest. Objection In case the Maitrāvarnņa priest were the person direc “ted, the words ‘Hotā yakshatetc. would become devoid of any meaning.
atra brūmaḥ/	tion, by the word hotr that has gone before it.
sarvathā tāvadanayoranyatarasya virodhe gauṇatvaṃ kalpanīyam / tatra praśāsṭaśabdasya hotaryatyantamanimittaḥ prayogo hoṭaśabdasya tu choṭakāryāpannamaitrāvaruṇesti nimittam /	To the above we make the following reply It is necessary to take one of the two words in question in its secondary signification because of the one being contradictory to the other. But the application of the word. Praçãstaḥ to the Hotr priest would be absolutely without foundation while that of the word Hotr to the Maiträvaruna priest would be based upon the fact of this latter priest performing the duties of the Hotr priest specially as all words expressive of the principal priest the Hotr f.i. are often found to be applied to his subordinates the Maitrāvaruṇa f.i.
sarvaeva pradhānaviṃgvacanāstatpuruṣeṣu prayujyamānā dṛṣṭā na tu viparyayaḥ /	while the reverse is never found to be the case.
tasmātpraśāstaliṅgatvānmantrastameva viniyuñjīta/	Consequently on account of the words of the mantra Praçāstaryaju” having the Power of indicating the Maiträvaruņa priest, it would be addressed in directing him.
na caitadvākyamatyantamanarthakameva bhavati praiṣāntareṣu caritārthatvādatosminviṣaye bādhyeteti	Nor does the sentence Tasman maitrā varuṇaḥ,etc. become wholly meaningless as it would have its use in regard to the other Directions and hence this sentence would certainly be rejected in reference to the one Direction in questión Praçāsturyaja.

To the above, some people make the following reply The discussion is not with regard to the complete sentence as one composite whole, but with regard to each of its parts.
tamminsodetyetatkṛtaṃ sākāṅkṣatvamāśrityaikavākyatvenodāhatamidameva pradhānakāraṇaṃ śakyate tadaśena yatheṣṭaṃ viśeṣaṇaviśeghyabhāvaṃ kalpayitvaikārthatvenaikavākyatvam /	And it has been already shown, on account of the wellestablished fact of Indicative Power being stronger than Syntac tical Connection, that the two sentences in question are wholly distinct. That is to say, it was the fact of the sentence tasmin sida being wanting in an integral factor, that was made the basis of the declaration of the two as forming a single sentence and certainly this is the principal basis of connecting two sentences syntactically as on that ground, we can assume, whenever we like, the relationship of the Qualification and the Qualified and thereby assuming the two to have a single purpose, they can be taken as syntactically connected.
tadyathā pūrvasyatāvaduttareṇa saha yadakṣaṃ ghṛtasya dhārayā sumukhaṃ tava sadanaṃ kalpayāmi tasminnevamitikarttavyatā ke pratitiṣṭha tvamitītikarttavyatāviśiṣṭapuroḍāśapratiṣṭhāpanamekaṃ prayojanam /	For instance, in the case in question, taking the former part with the latter, we have them conjointly denotingThe comfortable seat that I am preparing for thee by means of the flowing of butter, on the seat pre pared by this process thou shouldst sit down,thus the two together having the single purpose of depositing the cake by a certain process or they may mcanI am performing the preparation of the seat by means of the butterflow, for the purpose of your sitting the two together, in this case, having the single purpose of indicating the preparing of the seat with a particular result in this way, the two together could be taken as syntactically connected, and forming a single sentence.
yatta purastādarthanānātvānnānāvākyatvamuktaṃ tadiha sthitaṃ liṅgabalīyastvena yadi hi liṅgaṃ bannīyastataḥ saṃbhavadanyatara viśeṣaṇatvenaikavākyatvaṃ parityajyobhayoḥ pratyekaṃ svaprādhānyaṃ liṅgāvagatamāśritya viśeṣaṇa va dvitiraskāreṇa prayojanabhedādā kyabhedo bhavati tenāyaṃ viniyogadvāre vākyātmanābhasya liṅgaprādhānyasyāca balābajavicāraḥ tatrāpi pratīto labdhātmaka vākye sati bādhakapratyayasada sadbhāvavicāra iti draṣṭavyam /	The aforesaid declaration,that, on account of the difference in their purpose, they are distinct sentences, was based upon the fact of the Indicative Power of the two sentences being more authoritative than Syntactical Connection,a fact that has been established on the present occasion. In case Indicative Power is the stronger of the two, we reject the possibility of the two forming a single sentence on the chance of the one qualifying the other and we accept each of them to be self sufficient, as shown by Indicative Power and thus giving up all idea of the one serving as the qualification of the other, we find that each of them has a distinct purpose of its own and as such they cannot be taken as distinct sentences. Thus then, the present discussion refers to the fact of the two sentences being endowed with syntactical character, through their applications, and also to the strength or weakness of Indicative Power as compared to Syntactical Connection. Then again, the sentence having attained to its position, through our cognition of it as such, there follows the consideration of the presence or absence of cognitions to the contrary. Both Indicative Power and Syntactical Connection are equally way that at one time the two mantras would be used separately, while at times the two would be used conjointly in connection with any one of the two actions, and lastly, at times, with both of them.
kiṃ prāptam /	Question How could the sense of the scripture be so very un.
tulyabale iti / tadā cedṛśaṃ karma kadā cidvibhajya mantrī prayoktavyau / kadā citsamudāyonyataratra kadā citma evobhayatreti	The whole mantra, from the very beginning, is on the lookout for some use to which it should be put. And as a matter of fact, we find that the mantra ending with ‘kalpayāmi does not stand in need of anything outside itself consequently we conclude that that mantra ends then and there and finding its purpose duly served by that, we conclude that it is to be used in connection with the Pouring of Butter over the bedding and hence it can, in no way, be extended so far as the action of the Depositing of the Cake.
sarvathā yadi pramāṇata evamavagamyate kinno bādhyate	Though the word tat in tasmin stands in need of a certain antecedent, yet it could be taken as referring to the previouslyestablished meaning of the preceding sentence and there would be no incongruity in such a distinct use of the pronoun tat.
yonādiḥ kalpayāmyantaḥ svasāmathryena śakyate / nirākāṅkṣaḥ svakāryāya sākāitvaṃ parāśrayam	For instance, we have the sentence tapte payasi dadhyāṇayati, which ends with the laying down of the preparation of the substance, and then, we have the sentence ‘sã vaiçvadēvyāmikshā, which is taken distinctly by itself, as laying down, independently by itself, the relationship of that substance with the deity Vigvēdēva.
na ca parasyaitena vinānarthakatvāpattiryatastadbhayena nīyate sopi ci pratiṣṭhāpanāṅgatvenārthavān bhaviṣyati /	its corroborative Direct Declaration not very far from it and conse quently there can be no overlapping of the operations of the one by those of the other.
yadyapi ca tacchabdaḥ pūrvā pekṣastathāpi prakāśitaṃ nivṛttañca pūrvavākyārthamālocya bhinasyāpi pravartamānasya na kaścidirodhaḥ	Though this has been already said before, yet it is repeated over and over again, with a view to strengthen the conviction. And we can explain the repetition as serving the purpose of recapitulating the proper ties of the sentence in question, after the imposition of other foreign properties has been set aside. The first time that the declaration in question was made was with reference to the existence and nonexistence of authoritative means of cognition the second time it was with refer ence to its capability and incapability and the last time it is with reference to its serving and not serving visible visible purposes.
kiṃ punaḥ prakaraṇaṃ nāmeti /	In reality, however, there seems to be no difference between Context and Syntactical Connection or Order.
sarvatra siddhavatprakaraṇena vyavahāro na caitatka cinnirūpitapūrvaṃ tadidāpi tāvadasya svarūpaṃ nirūpyata nirjñāta svarūpasya hi balābalaṃ sujñāyataitya, tha vā naivāsya vākyakramābhyāṃ bhedaḥ sākāipadasannidhimātraṃ hi vākyami tyucyate tacca prakaraṇe'pyaviśiṣṭam	Or the word itikartavyatakankshā may be explained as that which needs the Procedure, i.e. the Bhävänä or the Apūrva and the vacana is of such a Bhāvānā or Apūrvathe two words with the genitive ending being taken as coextensive. a By vacunaDeclarationis meant the bringing about of a conviction by means of words. Thus then, the upshot of the whole definition comes to be this Even though the Need may be existent, in the nature of things, yet that alone does not constitute the Context but it is only when it is duly cognized that it comes to be so called and that too only when it is cognized as subservient to that which is to be accomplished, and not independently by itself. Therefore it is the Need, when clearly expressed, that constitutes Context or the Bhavand along with the Need may be taken as consti tuting it.
kaḥ punarārthaviprakarṣa iti /	Question What is the example of this? Whatever example you will bring forward, I shall show it to fall under Syntactical Connection.
samākhyāyāmantarṇītasaṃbandhasaṃbandhyabhidhāyitvāna saṃbhavatīti manyate /	The Siddhanti cites the case of the Suktavaka,being fully conscious of the fact that the Brahmana and the Mantra, serving the distinct func tions of enjoining and recalling something connected with the perform ance respectively, can never be syntactically connected.
nirjñāta prakaraṇe na kenāpi sakavākyatve iti /	Objection The words expressive of the Deities of the Pūrṇamāsa being fully taken up with their own accessories, there can be no room for any other accessories. Reply True but that does not remove the contradiction between Syntactical Connection and Context.
prakaraṇāvirodhinaṃ kramaviniyogaṃ kevala samākhyā pratiyogitvena ca darśayati /	Secondly, Context shows that it should be used several times while Syntactical Connection shows that it is to be used only once, in accordance with the word expressive of the Deity and this constitutes a contradiction between Context and Syntactical Connection. Thirdly, Syntactical Connection is the stronger of the five because its connections are fully established.
kathaṃ punaḥ prakaraṇaṃ na virudhyate /	Reply This does not affect the case in question because we could have a subcontext of the Abhishēcanīya only if the actions in question were mentioned before all the requirements of the Abhishēcaniya had been supplied.
yadā tena sarvārthatvaṃ jāyamānamutsṛjya kramavaśena kevalasānāyyārthatvaṃ vijñāyate /	The sense of this is that in the case of Order, the proximity of something is a necessary concomitant. That is to say, that which is spoken of as serving the purpose of many things, cannot possibly be in close proximity with all the principals concerned and hence it is only necessary for it to be in close proximity with any one of these.
naiṣa doṣaḥ /	There is no need of any such necessary concomitant in the case of Context.
yadi prakṛte vayaṃ kramaviniyogamabhyapagacchema tata evaṃ svādiha tu prakaraṇenatantravārtika / darśa pūrṇamāsānyatarārthatve 'vadhārite tadviśeṣākāṅkṣāyāṃ kevala eva kramo vyāpriyataitvavirodhaḥ /	Consequently whenever Context and Order both start on a common errand, the Context is quicker in getting at its corroborative Direct Declaration and as such it is the stronger of the two. Question What is the example of conflict between Order and Name? This question emanates from one labouring under the mis conception that, inasmuch as the Name applies to its object in its literal signification, it is as operative in its indication of the relationship as Direct Declaration itself and as such it is very much stronger than Order. Answer We find that the name Puurodāçika applies to the whole section of the DarçaPurnamāsa.
nanu sarvārthatvenāvadhāraṇadyataḥ kutaścidapi nivṛttau prakaraṇaṃ bādhyate /	Question What do you mean by the remoteness from the objective P That is to say, no such is possible in the case of Name, which denotes that factor of the relationship which has the idea of that relationship included within itself.
na cāvaṇyaṃ sarvārthatvaṃ prakaraṇenāvadhāryaṃte mantrasyaikenāpi saṃbadhya kṛtārthatvātprakaraṇināṃ ca mantrāntarairapyarthasiddheḥ /	Reply As a matter of fact, the Context does not necessarily indicate the fact of the mantra applying to all the vessels because the mantra has its requirements fulfilled by being related to a single one of the vessels and as for the other vessels spoken of in the Context, they could have their purposes equally served by other mantras. In the case in question, what is accomplished, prior to the operation of the Order, is the Direct Declaration, laying down the use of the mantra, in general terms.
sāmānyaviniyogaśrutimātrameva ceha kramātpūrvataraṃ niṣpadyate /	This is what is shown by the Bhashya in the sentenceman is a com petent authority on such points, as that the mantra is mentioned in the position or order of the sānnāyya, ‘it occurs in such and such a Context, there is such and such a Syntactical Connection, this word is Vedlic, and so forth.
tatra yāvadviśeṣa śrutimekaikaṃ pratikalpayati tāvat krameṇāpi kalpitaiveti prākaraṇako viśeṣaśruti rupasaṃdriyate /	Thus then, among Direct Declaration and the rest, as put forth in the Bhashya, Direct Declaration always sets aside others, while Name is always set aside by others, and the others set aside by, and are set aside by others. The Bhāshya next proceeds to show, through an objection, the form of that which is set aside. Question In a case of conflict between any two of these, when it is said that one is set aside by the other,e.g.
samākhyā punaḥ kramaviparītārthatvādvirudhyate/	It has been declared that the matter in question is amenable to both, because of the existence of the common cause.
viprakarṣācca durbalā sarvodi saṃbandhaḥ kena cidavāntara sāmānyena bhavati/ na ca mantrapuroḍāśayostahadaklṛptaṃ kiṃ cidasti /	But as a matter of fact, Indicative Power and the rest do not, by themselves, possess the direct capability of bringing about a correct cognition nor is this capability possible when there does not exist a Direct Declaration giving rise to that cognition consequently, it is only through the assumption of the corrobo rative Direct Declaration, that Indicative Power,etc. correct cognition consequently when the inferred Direct Declaration has been brought about, there can be no difference between such a Direct Declaration and one that is directly perceptible and hence both Indica tive Power and Direct Declaration would come to be equally authori tative.
yathā sānnāyyena saha deśa sāmānyam /	For instance, as a matter of fact, the previous cognition due to Direct Declaration f.i.
lokikastu śabdaḥ samākhyeti bhakṣānuvāke parihatamapi sahedikasaṃbandhaviprakarṣārthamupanyasyate / parastu liṅgānirākaraṇoktenaiva mārgeṇa mūnotkarttanenaiva samākhyāṃ nirākṛtāṃ manyamāna ā cha /	Even though the passages under consideration, appearing in the Bhashya at the conclusion of the Adhikarana, would appear to be referring to the subjectmatter of the Adhikaraṇa, yet we proceed to explain them by taking them apart from the place in which they are actually found, as is indicated by their inherent capability just as is the case with the mantras to be addressed to Püshan which are used in a place other than that in which they are mentioned in the Veda. Inasmuch as the way in which one Means of knowledge sets aside the other has already been explained above, the sentence atha yattatraetc. cannot possibly refer to the Rejection by Direct Declaration,etc. the matter of Rejection must have brought to the mind of the Author all the different kinds of Rejection that are met with in the course of a treatment of the scriptures.
yadyevamityādi /	the generic would set aside the specific.
siddhāntavādī tu bhakṣānuvākoktamevottaraṃ darśayati / yadi hyaṅgāṅgibhāvotra puruṣapratyayābhavet / tataḥ syādapramāṇatvaṃ sa tu vaidika eva naḥ	And if, in view of the cara and the takra, it be held that there is no text relating to the kuça and the Kaundinya,then there could be no text applying to the Prayajas and the Mathara Brāhmaṇa respectively. If however there be a text relating to these latter, then there must be one relating to the kuça and the Kaundinya also. The assertion that it does not exist in reference to the latter, while it does with reference to other things, would involve a selfcontradiction, striking at the very authority of the text.
bādhikaiva śrutirnityaṃ samākhyā bādhyate sadā /	ever, it consists of the Oluss, in the case of the Implication of certain operations relative to the sacrifice,the object being one only, at one and the same time, there could be only one operative scriptural text.
madhyamānāṃ tu bādhyatvaṃ bādhakatvamapekṣayā bāghasyoktaprakāratvātpraśnastāvanna yujyate /	That is to say, in the case of sentences emanating from human sources,as the sense imparted to the words used resides in the heart of the speaker, it would be possible for him to make the ‘arbitrary declaration I made this assertion, but I did not mean it to apply to such and such cases,even though the words used do not imply anything of this exception.
sthite cāprāptabādhatve prāptabādhopi nottaram	But even this arbitrary exception is not possible in the case of a Vedic sentence.
pūrvaṃ paramajātatvādabādhitvaiva jāyate parasthānanyathotpāḍhānna tvabādhena saṃbhavaḥ na bādhasyaikarūpatvameṣitavyaṃ niyogataḥ / na kiṃ ciḍiruṇadvī nānārūpyaṃ pramāṇavat	To the above we make the following replyIt is by no means necessary that all Rejections should be of one uniform character specially as there is no incongruity in their diversity, which is supported by authori tative evidence. That is to say, just as in the case of Rejections explained before, there was no uniformity of character,so, in the same manner, even if we admit of a diversity in their character, there is no incongruity in it. Thus then, we conclude that in the case of Direct Declaration etc., the rejection is one of something that has not been accomplished, as has been explained before and there is nothing incongruous in that as we do not admit of more than one accomplishment with regard to any one thing.
kathamiti śrutyādivecacaṇyavismitasya praśnaḥ / uttaramāi sāmānyasya kāraṇasya vidyamānatvāditi /	those of the false means of knowledge by the true one, of the necessary by the occasional, etc., etc.,it has been declared that it is the accomplished that is rejected. Question How is that? This question emanates from one who has been bewildered by the said dissimilarity from Direct Declarationetc. Answer Because of the existence of the common cause.
darśitametad brāhmaṇapra tantravārtika /	This fact, of the commonality of cause being the reason for believing the rejection to be one of something that has been accomplished, has been explained above, in connection with the words Brahmana and Prakṛtivat.
yattu prāptasya jñānasyānutpādoccheda saṃskāravicchedānāmaśakyatvānnāsti bādhanamiti /	It has been argued that there can be no rejection of that cognition which has been accomplished, because no nonappearance, destruction, or cessation of residual effects is possible for such a cognition.
tatrāha naiva nivarttate kiṃ tarhi mithyājñānametaditi pratyayāntaraṃ bhavatīti /	And in reply to this it is pointed out that we do not mean that the cognition is wholly set aside all that we mean is that it is superseded by another cognition, which is to the effect that the previous cognition was a mistaken one. That is to say, what happens in such cases, is that on finding a subsequent scrip tural text to be otherwise inexplicable i.e.
tasmātprayājādimāṭharādiprāptivelāyāmupajātāpi kuśa/ ṇḍinyabuddhirbhrāntiriti niścitya phalavimuktatvānubaddhamarthaṃ śāstraṃ vā bādhituṃ manyate /	irreconcilable with the cognition accomplished, one comes to the conclusion that this cognition that he intellect having been led away by a false similarity,just as in the case of the mirageetc. Consequently, when we come to the case of the Prayājas and the MatharaBrahmaṇa, though we may have the ideas of the kuça and Kaundinya respectively appearing, yet they are believed to be mistaken and from this it is concluded that on account of the cogni tion being devoid of its legitimate result in the shape of the carrying of it into practice, it is the cognized idea, or text, that is rejected in all such cases.
kiṃ nu khalvamithyā jñānasya rūpamiti / yadyatpannā api pratyayāḥ pratyayāntarityaṃ nirākriyante tato 'nyatrāpi ka śvāsa iti manyate tatkathayati /	Question What, then, is the form of true knowledge? That is to say, if the cognitions that actually appear come to be set aside in the manner shown above, then, how could we have confidence in any cogni tion at all? Reply When we find that however much we may look for it, we do not perceive any cognition setting aside the cognition that we have obtained then we conclude that that cognition is a true one.
yattu kāraṇadoṣajñānaṃ dvitīyamupalakṣaṇaṃ tamokaviṣayatvānna vede saṃbhavatoti nopanyastam /	Thor a former occasion in the Çlokavārtika we have spoken of the recog nition of discrepancies in the source of the cognition, as the second reason for the falsity of that cognition, yet that was with reference to ordinary human assertions and hence, not pertaining to Vedic sentences this fact has been brought out on the present occasion. Sūtra On account of the Context, the word ahinashould be taken in a sense indicated by the presence of a certain qualification.
prāsaṅgikamutkā idānīmadhikaraṇamupasaṃhṛtyādhikaraṇāntaramārabhyate tatra prakaraṇamya tāvacchatiliṅgavākyaiḥ saha virodhāvirodhā saṃpradhāryete /	Question All that had been laid down at the beginning of the Adhyâya as its subjectmatter, having been fully dealt with, what more of it is left to be treated of, that the fourth Adhyaya is not now taken up forthwith? Answer We now proceed to consider in what specific cases we have the conflict of Direct Declaration and the rest, that have been duly differ entiated and explained in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa. And first of all we are going to deal with the cases of the conflict and nonconflict of Context by Direct Declaration, Indicative Power and Syntactical Connection.
jyotiṣṭome śrūyate tisra eva sānhasyopasadaḥ kāryā dvādaśāhīnasceti /	In the context of the Jyotishtoma we find the sentenceThere are to be three upasads for the Sähna and twelve for the Ahina. And in this the word sahna, meaning that which is finished in a day, refers to the Jyotishtoma, with regard to which we have the declarationThey finish it within a day consequently it follows that the Jyotishtoma has three upasads.
dvādaśāhīnasyeti tu dvādaśoṣasattvaṃ kiṃ jyotiṣṭomasyāthā honasya dvādaśāhāderiti saṃdihyate / yadyahonaśabdaḥ kathaṃ cit jyotiṣṭome 'pyupapadyate tataḥ prakaraṇasyāvirodhāttasminneva niveśaḥ /	Then as regards the clause twelve for the Ahina, there arises the question as to whether twelve upasads also belong to the Jyotish toma, or only to the Ahīna sacrifices, the Dvādaçãha TwelveDay sacrifice and the rest? If the name Ahina could, in some way or other, be found to be applicable to the Jyotishṭoma, then, in view of the compatibility of the Context, the twelve upasads would certainly be taken as finding a place in that sacrifice. The continuity of the Siddhänta having been broken by the word vā in the sutra, we declare that, from the Context it is clear that the twelve upasads belong to the Jyotishtoma. Nor does this involve a contradiction of Direct Declaration because the same Context shows that the name Ahina applies to the Jyotishṭoma and not to any other sacri fices, . And further, the word Ahina, by itself also, when taken as a negative compound, is found to be literally applicable to the Jyotishtoma.
athāhīna ityahargaṇanāmadheyaṃ tataḥ śrutyā saṃyuktatvāda saṃyuktagrahaṇasvabhāvena prakaraṇenāgrahaṇa,masti hi tadānīṃ śrutiprakaraṇayorvirodhaḥ /	Though in reality, the word Ahina=ahan+kha=group of sacrifices, and as such it denotes the sacrifices extending over a number of days, yet, in order to reconcile it with the Context, we should take it as synony. mous with Jyotishṭoma, on the ground of this latter having the quali fication of ahani nondeficiency and nonabandonment. That is to say, inasmuch as the Jyotishṭoma has all its details minutely laid down, and it serves as the archetype of all sacrifices, it is in no way deficient na hiyatë nor is it abandoned na hiyatë by any sacrifice i.e.
kiṃ prāptam /	there is no sacrifice of which it does not serve as the archetype.
sidvāntenopakramaṃ vāśabdena vyāvartya prakaraṇād jyotiṣṭomārthatvamiti pratijānīmahe /	“The Bhashya has explained the word ahīna, in its application to the Jyotishtoma as that which is not liable to any retrenchment nu hiyate as regards either the sacrificial gifts, or the accessory details of the sacrifice.
na ca śrutivirodhaḥ prakaraṇādevāhīna śabdasyāpi jyotiṣṭomagāmitvā, dasti ca nañasamāsāncākhyānena tadabhidhānasāmathyaṃmato yadyapyanhaḥ khaḥ kratusamūhe ityevaṃ vyutpādyamāno 'cargaṇavāccaddīnaśabdo bhavati tathāpi virodhaparihārārthamahāniguṇayogādeva jyotiṣṭomārthaḥ sa marṣaṇīyaḥ /	But this is not quite relevant because the word does not contain anything to denote the sacrificial gift or the accessory details and if we were to interpret a word just as we wished without any considera tion of what it actually denotes, then, there would be no fixity as to the denotations of a word. Even granting, for the sake of argument, that the word really denotes what the Bhashya has said,we find that as a matter of fact, the gifts given at the Jyotishtoma are very much less hina than those given at several other sacrifices, where gifts are com puted by the thousand and also that the procedure of the Jyotishtoma is much inferior hina, in the point of accessory details, to the Pro cedures of its modifications, the Ukhthya and the rest, and as such the word Ahina in the sense given to it by the Bhashya, could not apply to the Jyotish toma. sacrifice for all of which it serves as the original fountainhead and inasmuch as it is the Jyotishtoma alone that is possessed of these qualifications and fulfils these conditions, and as the Context too be longs to the Jyotishtoma, it must be this to which the twelve upasads belong.
sa hi kṛtsnavidhānātmavaiprakṛtitvācca na kuśvidīyate /	Sutra Inasmuch as the principal Jyotishtoma is not connected with Ahīna, it should be disjoined from that.
na cainaṃ ke cidapi kratavaḥ prakṛtitvena jaiti/ yattu bhāṣyakāreṇoktaṃ dakṣi pābhiḥ kratukaraṇairvā na dīyataiti asaṃyogāttu mukhyasya tasmādapakṛ vyeta	And inas much as the Jyotishṭoma has no connection with this name, the number Twelve that is found mentioned in connection with that name could not be taken as belonging to that sacrifice, merely because of the Context consequently it must be taken and used apart from that. Specially as we find that the number Twelve is connected with the Ahina, by means of the Direct Declaration of the genitive in ‘ahīnasyu and as for the word aḥīna what it literally signifies is a number of days, while the Jyotishṭoma is a distinct Sähna,being finished in a single day.
mukhyaḥ prathama kāryatvāj jyotiṣṭomo 'bhidhīyate /	It has been argued above that the word ahina would apply to the Jyotishṭoma, through the presence of certain qualifications in that sacrifice and we now proceed to refute every alternative that is possible, in connec tion with this theory.
dīnaśabdasaṃyogo na tu tasya kathaṃ cana /	If the word gauna be taken in the sense of indirect secondary signification, then that could not justify the abandoning of the direct signification, on the mere strength of the Context.
na sā prakaraṇāttasya senāmādapakṛṣyate	Nor does the sentence in question serve the purposes of an Arthavāda, in which case even the oneday sacrifice could be taken as being eulogised by being indirectly spoken of as one extending over many days.
na cedamarthavādārthaṃ yenaikāhopi praśaṃsitumahargaṇavadupacaryate / na cāsya śabdāntaraṃ nāsti yena siṃhaguṇamamūha ivetthaṃ kleśena pratipādyate /	Then again, as a matter of fact, it is not that there is no other word applicable more directly to the Jyotishtoma and as such we could not be justified in taking all this trouble of interpreting the word indirectly, and thereby making it appli cable to that sacrifice, in the same way as the word simha is made to indicate the presence of the qualities of the lion.
tasmādaupacārikatvaṃ tāvadayuktam /	Consequently the taking of the word in its indirect secondary sense is not admissible.
na ca nasamāsenāvayavavyutpattiḥ sa mudāyaprasidyā tannirākaraṇāt/ na ca nanmamāmasya nakṣaṇamasti natrasamāse hi satyavyayapūrvapada prakṛti svara sattvāt ādyudāttatvaṃ syāt /	Nor can the word be rightly made literally applicable to the Jyotishtoma, by being explained as a negative compound. Because any such literal application is set aside by the meaning known to be conveyed by the word as a whole. Then again, as a matter of fact, we do not find the word bearing the marks of a negative compound because a negative compound having the accent of the indeclinable, it is the first word, or the basic word, that should have had the udatta Acute accent in its beginning while, in reality, we find that it has the acute accent at the middle.
tathā hi sati āyannādiṣu upadeśivaḍacanaṃ svarasihyarthamityevamīnādeśe āśrīyamāṇe pratyayādyudāttatvena īkāre svaraḥ sidhyati tasmāda cargaṇanāmadheyametat /	In that case, in accordance with the Pārtika, āyannādishu upadēçivadvacanam svarasiddhyartham, we have the insertion of the particle ‘īna and thereby the letter i forming the beginning of the affix, it is only right that the accuteaccent should be on that letter. For these reasons, the word Ahina must be taken as the name of those sacrifices that extend over a number of days. Then again, inasmuch as the connection of the Jyotishtoma with the twelve upasads would have been signified by the use of the word sähna only, without using another name ahina of the same sacrifice,the very fact of the putting in of the word ahina shows that the scripture meant, by this, to signify something other than the oneday Jyotishtoma.
tataśvānantaryāttritvasyāpi tatsaṃbandha eva prasajyataiti vyavasthārthaṃ sānhagrahaṇamapyarthavat /	And then inasmuch as the close proximity of the mention of three upasads to the word Ahinasya might indicate the connection of these latter with the Ahina, it would be necessary to specify the sahna also as the one connected with three upasads. Thus then, it must be admitted that the twelve upasads has to ne taken apart from the Jyotishtomawhich is indicated by the Context as the sacrifice connected with them.
na tu kitadyuktam /	The above representation of the Adhikarana is not quite correct.
paraprakaraṇe nyadharmavidharanyāyyatvāttena vā saṃbandhapadavyavāyavicchinnasya prakaraṇasya punaranusaṃdhānakleśād dvādaśopasada iti ca dvādaśāhaprakaraṇe vicitatvāttatprakṛtitvena sarvāhīneṣu ta tprāpterata stritvamevāsmin vākye sarvadoṣarahitatvādvidhīyate / dvādaśatvaṃ khaddīnasaṃbandhivākyāntarādeva prāptamaucitya rūpeṇāsya stutyarthaṃ nivītādivadanūdyate iti /	as all the sacrifices extending over a number of days have their origin in this Twelve Day sacrifice, the said injunction in the Context of this latter would be enough to connect the Twelve upasads with all such sacrifices. Consequently, the sentence in question must be taken wholly as containing the injunction of the three upasads alone specially as there are no objections against this. Then, as for the connection of Twelve, that has been enjoined already in another sentence and hence its mention in the sentence in question must be taken as meant to be in praise of the propriety of the number of upasads at the Jyotishtoma, just as in the case of the nivîta the sense of the sentence being that the Jyotishtoma has only three upasads, and as for twelve upasads these belong to such petty sacrifices as the Ahina and the rest, and not to the excellent Jyotishtoma sacrifice.
kathaṃ tadhikaraṇaṃ netanyam /	Now then, we proceed to show the way in which the Adhikaraṇa should be represented.
kiṃ jyotiṣṭomohīnastasya cedaṃ prakaraṇādaṅgaṃ vidhīyate athāhargaṇastasya ca prāptamevānyārthamanūcata iti / nanvevaṃ satyadargaṇasaṃbaddhamapyetat jyotiṣṭomasyaiva satyarthamupa yuktamiti prakaraṇavirodhāvirodhavicārābhāvaḥ prāpnoti /	If the character of Ahina had belonged to the Jyotishṭoma, then, the sentence in question would have been an Injunction but inas much as that character belongs to the sacrifices extending over a number of days, for which, again, the twelve upasads have been already laid down elsewhere,the sentence in question cannot but be taken as meant to eulogise the Jyotishtoma as shown above. Thus then, the question of the Adhikarana comes to be this Is the Jyotishtoma the Ahina, for which the sentence, occurring in its Con text, lays down an accessory detail? Or the word Ahina applies to the sacrifices extending over a number of days,and inasmuch as the twelve upasads for it have been laid down elsewhere, their mention in the sentence in question is meant to serve some other purpose that of enlogising f.i.? Objection If such be the case, then the Adhikarana would not be a discussion of the conflict and nonconflict of Context with Direct, Declaration because it would come to this, that though connected with the Ahina sacrifices the twelve pasads would be mentioned with a view to eulogise the Jyotish toma.
naiṣa doṣaḥ /	Reply That does not quite affect the case.
pūrvapa hi dvādaśatvasya vidhīyamānasya prakaraṇaṃ grāhakaṃ bhavatītyanūdyate/ siddhānte tvacagaiṇasaṃyuktasya prakaraṇaṃ neṣṭam iti bādhyeta/	Because as a matter of fact, the Purvapaksha B would favour the Context inasmuch as the Context would take up the number twelve as enjoined in connection with the subject of the Context, the Jyotishtoma while the Siddhānta B does not favour the Context as in accordance with this view the twelve belongs to the sacrifices extending over many days, which has nothing to do with the Context which latter therefore, in this case, becomes contradicted.
anyatve tadyattathā satyapi prakārāntareṇa prakaraṇaevopayuktamiti /	And that this is still of use, in another way, in the Context has got nothing to do with the main point at issue.
yadā tu dvitvaba itvanyāyenotkarṣopikathaṃ cidāśrīyate śākhāntaravidhau ca satyapi śākhāntarīyasya prayojanāntararahitasya vidhitvamupapadyate tadā yathābhāṣyameva śakyaṃ samarthayitum / sarvathā dvādaśāhīnasyetyetattāvada hargaṇaviṣayatvātprakaraṇādutkṛṣyataiti siddham	If however, in accordance with the law arrived at in the next Adhikarana, we could admit of the Removal or taking apart, of the twelve upasads , and if while we had the Injunction in one Rescen sional text, we could justify, on the ground of its having no other use, the injunctive character of that contained in another Text,then, in that case, we could take the Adhikarana as presented in the Bhashya. Sutra That which is associated with singleness and duality should be taken apart because it is directly enjoined elsewhere. The discussion of the present question is similar to that in the fore going Adhikarana, with the following difference in the former the connection was with a totally different Primary sacrifice denotable by a word having no connection with that sacrifice which formed the subject of the Context while in the present case, it is with a property, the duality,etc. of the yajamana, which is, in some way or other, suspected of being related to the subject of the Context.
pakṣeṇārthakṛtasyeti cet	The passage in question does not lay down the Duality and Plural ity of the yajamāna because it is fully taken up with the enjoining of the Pratipats and refers to the Duality,etc. only as conditions for the use of the one or the other Pratipat specially as the Injunction of many things would involve a syntactical split.
prakaraṇajjyiotiṣṭome niveśaḥ /	Sūtra Objection They might find They might find place in the Jyotishṭoma as alternatives implied for a special pur pose.
na cāhīnavada prakṛtyajñasaṃvandhosti yajamānadvitvādisaṃbandhastu nimittamātraupayikatvānnāṅgāṅgibhāvāya prabhavati / na ca tadvāreṇa ṛtusaṃbandho ghaṭate lakṣaṇāprasaṃṅgāt	They are not in any way connected with any sacrifice other than that which forms the subject of the Context,as had been found to be the case with the Ahina. As for the connection of the Duality,etc. of the yajamāna, it is mentioned merely as a condition for the use of particu lar Pratipats, and it has nothing to do with the indicating of the connec tion of certain accessories with their Primaries. Nor could these serve as the means of establishing the connection of any sacrifice as that would involve the necessity of the words being taken in their indirect. secondary significations and as a matter of fact, those that have had their use laid down by Direct Declaration, cannot rightly be brought into another use, on the ground of an indirect secondary signification.
nimittaṃ prakaraṇe nāstīti taducyate 'rthā bhaviṣyati	If the connection meant were that with the mere form of the Duality,etc. then the Injunction itself would become wholly useless. And there can be no doubt that the assumption of Context isfar more reasonable than that of the Result.
na cādyāpi yajamānaikatva katva vivakṣāmavadhārayāmaḥ atha vaitadeva pratipadvidhānaṃ dṛṣṭvārthād dibahuyajamānakarttṛśrutiṃ kalpayiṣyāmaḥ	And up to this time we have had nothing to show that only one yajamāna is really meant for the Jyotishtoma though in fact, even if due siguificance were attached to the singleness of the yajamāna,yet, just as, in accordance with the Sutra VIiii, certain accessory details of the Jyotishtoma are left off, in the case of “the yajamāna being found incapable of performing them all, so, in the same manner, it may be that in the case of one yajamāna being found incapable of finishing the sacrifice, two or more of them could very reasonably be brought in to do it.
na prakṛtereka saṃyogāt	Sūtra Reply Not so because the original Sacrifice of the Context is connected with one only.
prakṛtigrahaṇaṃ prakṛtapratipattyarthamopadeśikatvādvātyantānatikramārtham	The word Prakṛti here is meant to signify the Sacrifice that forms the subject of the Context and it might have been meant to indicate that, being the object of direct Injunction, the singleness of the yajamana in the Jyotishtoma cannot be superseded though that which is indirectly implied could be rejected, for special purposes.
na cāsyāvi vayāṃ kāraṇamasti yadyapyaśaktikṛtaṃ cāpanaṃ tadadhyeko yathā śaknuyādityupanvādanyāṅgaviṣayaṃ vijñāyate śaknoti hi dakṣiṇāparimāṇaṃ parityajyaikopi nirvarttayitum /	Nor do we find any reason for not attaching a significance to the singular member of that verb in fact we shall show later on, in Adhyâya VI, that due significance is really meant to be attached to it. The leaving off of certain accessories of the Jyotishṭoma, on account of the incapacity of the sacrificer to carry them all out entirely, that has been brought forward by the Pürvapakshi, is also based upon the declaration the Sacrifice should be performed in such a way as one person may be able to perform it and in other cases also we find the word one, which shows that the leaving off allowable is meant to refer to other accessories and not to the number of yajantānas as for instance, leaving off the exact amount of the gift, the sacrifice can be fully accomplished by one person.
utpattiprayogacodanāsthatvācca saṃkhyānugraha eva yuktaḥ tasmādeka yajamānakatvānna prakṛtī nimittamastītyutkṛṣyate	Then again, inasmuch as the number one is found both in the originative injunction of the Jyotishtoma, as well as in that of its actual performance, we cannot but attach due significance to that number. Thus then, we conclude that inasmuch as the origi nal sacrifice of the Jyotishṭoma has only one yajamāna, it does not fulfil the conditions of the use of the particular Pratipats in questión and hence these latter must be taken apart from it.
yadi hyetannimittamanākṣipadanarthakobhavettata ākṣipe,tkathaṃ caitadanarthakaṃ bhavedyadi prakṛ tāvivānyatrāpi dvitvaba itve na syātām / nanu te anyatra na staḥtantravārtike /	But this is not possible because the passage is capable of being taken differently and as such there would bé no Apparent Inconsistency to justify the implication. That is to say, if, without implying the said conditions, the passage would have been meaningless, then it could be taken as implying them and this meaninglessness would have been possible, only if the Duality and Plurality of yajamänas did not exist in any sacrifice, in the same way that it does not exist in the Jyotishtoma as a matter of fact, we do not find these to be nonexistent in other sacrifices as they are actually found to exist in the Kulaya and other sacrifices.

If the Duality of the yajamāna were meant to refer to the presence of the wife of the yajamina,then, as her presence with her husband is a necessary condition for all sacrifices, such Duality could not have been laid down as the condition for the use of a certain particular Pratipat only and further, in the case of the word bahubhyaḥ, inasmuch as it is dis tinctly found to denote the plurality of men, by making it include the sacrificers wives, we would be assuming, without sufficient grounds, an ēkaçěsha compound made up of heterogeneons elements one male and two females.

That is to say, if the sentence be taken as laying down the Patnisamyājas as purificatory rites for the purification of the Jäghani the animals tail, then, inasmuch as the object of purification would be the predominant factor, it could not be removed from its place and consequently, the Patnisamyajus would be taken to where the Tail might be, and not vice versd. And inasmuch as the ordinary animals Tail would be of no use in a sacrifice, it is not this that forms the object of purification by means of the Patnisamyajas conse quently the Tail of the animal that has served its purpose in connec tion with the Agnishomiya would come to be taken as that to be purified by the Patnisamyājas . If, on the other hand, the sentenee be taken as laying down the Tail with refer ence to the Patnisamyājas, then, in that case, inasmuch as the idea of. the sentence being a reference to the subject of the Context does not entirely disappear, the injunction of the Tail comes to belong to the DarçaPurnamāsa .
yadi tu patnīsaṃyājoddeśena jāghanī vidhīyate tataḥ prakṛtānuvādabuddhyanapāyāddarśapūrṇamāsayoreva jāghanovidhānam	the Putnisamyāja being enjoined by means of the verbal root in ‘ samyājayēt is more approx imate to the Injunction because, inasmuch as any single part of “an animal the Tail could not justify the employment of the whole Y animal, it would be necessary to take it out of the animal that has been used elsewhere, and hence in that case the Samyñja would come to have the character of a Pratipattisamskära the setting aside of that which has been used therefore the sentence in question must be taken as laying down the purification of the Tuil of the animal used in connection with the Agnishomiya and hence it must be taken apart from the Context of the DarçaPūrņumāsa.

yadi punarucyate evaṃ sanīti yojyate tataḥ paricodanāchāyāpatterna ca tadyuktamuttarānabhidhānāttasmādātmavacanatvenai va yojyam	And in this last sentence, the word ucyate must be taken along with the preceding sentence as shown above and then follows in the Bhashya a des cription of the action such being the case, the Patnisamyajas of the DarçaPārṇamāsu do not lose anything by being disjoined from the Tail,etc. If on the other hand, the word ueyatê were taken with what follows itas ucyatē ēvam sati, etc.then the sentence would fall into the semblance of an objection which would not be desirable specially as we do not find any sentence in the Bhashya that could be taken as supplying an answer to that objection.
prāpnuyādevam	Objection If what you say be correct, then, there being a Removal of the Patnīsamyājas, exactly like that of the Pratipats shown above,there would be no performance of the Patnīsamyājas V in connection with the original sacrifice of the DarçaPurnamāsa.
na kasya citpadārthasyotkarṣa idameva tu vākyaṃ vikanau kāryaṃ kurva dutkṛṣyate ityucyate	Reply There might be no performance of these, if there were no Patnīsamyājas in connection with the Paçu sacrifice as a matter of fact, the existence of these in this latter is quite patent, by reason of being implied and what the sentence in question does is simply to lay these down as connected with the Tail.
kutaḥ /	. Sutra It is the injunction of the Tail, because it is something new.
jāghanyuddiśyamānā syātsaṃskāryotkarṣa kāraṇam ihopāṭīyate 'ṅgatvādyā geṣvājyavadeva sā	As a matter of fact, the Injunction in question is not taken apart from the Context because if the Tail were referred to as something to be purified by means of the Patnisamyājas, then that would have been the cause of the Injunction being taken apart as a matter of fact, however, we find that the Tail is enjoined as an accessory of the Sacri fice, exactly like the other accessories, in the shape of Butter and the like.
pa tnīsaṃyājāścānantaravihitā manasi varttantaiti na vidhātuṃ śakyante /	Then, as for the Patnisamyājas, these have been enjoined in a sentence immediately preceding the one under consideration and as such being still present in the mind as enjoined actions at the time that we come across the sentence under consideration, they cannot be taken as the objects of injunction by this latter sentence.
na ceha sthitena paśugatapatnī saṃyājānuvādo yuktastahuḍyabhāvāt /	Nor can the sentence in question be rightly taken as merely referring to the Patnīsamyājas of the Paçusacrifice because at the time of its appearance, there is no idea of the Paçusacri fice.
yadi ca kṛtārthaṃ jāghanoṃ prastutvāyaṃ vi dhiḥ pravartteta tathāpi tāvatkadā citprayājaśeṣavad dvitīyārtheḍhatoyeti vyākhyāyeta /	Nor can it be urged that it could be so, on the ground of its being an object of purification. Because there is no ground for superseding the fact of its being an accessory to the sacrifice, as expressed by the Instrumental ending in Jäghanyā. If the Injunction under consideration were to operate with reference to that Tail which has served its purpose elsewhere,then, in that case, it might be possible to take the Instrumental as having the sense of the Accusative just as we have in the case of the accessories of the Prayāja.
sā tvapūrvā vidhīyate /	As a matter of fact, the Tail that is laid down is something quite new, not made use of on any previous occasion.
tasmānnotkarṣatanpravārtika /	Consequently it is wholly incapable of being taken apart.
na ca prakaraṇabadvatvāḍhate patnīsaṃyājā utkarṣe sahate /	Nor can the Patnīsumyājas bear being taken apart, as they are bound up with the Context.
vākyabalīyastvāditi cenna /	It may be argued that they would be taken apart, on account of the superior authority of Syntactical Connectiou.

Patnisamyājas, then alone could the Syntactical Connection have wrested them away from the Context. As a matter of fact, however, these Patni samyājas have their originative Injunction in another sentence and hence by the time that they are taken up, through proximity, by the syntactical connection of the sentence under consideration, they could also be taken up by the DarçaPurnamāsa.
na ca jāghanyāḥ phalavattvaṃ vijñātaṃ yenaiṣāṃ prayojanākāṅkṣāmapanayet /	Nor have we, up to this time, come to know the Tail as leading to any independent result of its own, whereby it could supply the requirement of the Patnisamyājas as regards the purpose to be served by them.
ato yāvadasau kimarthetyālocyate tāvatphalavadarśapūrṇamāsaprasūtena kathaṃbhāvenāṅgatvamāpāditam /	Consequently, while we are looking out for the purpose to be served by the Tail, it is taken up as an accessory, forming part of the Procedure of the DarçaPurnamāsa, which are known to lead to distinct results.
na cehāpūrvayāga vidhānaṃ yajimānatvenā śravaṇāt /	Manageme Nor does the sentence in question contain the Injunction of any new sacrifice as it is not found to mention the root ‘yaji only what it mentions is the yaja in conjunction with Patni.

And so long as the sentence is capable of being taken as the injunction of simpler things, the syntactical split could not be explained by taking the sentence as the injunction of the action as qualified by the Deity, etc., etc..
tasmādviśiṣṭaṃ yāgamuddigya dravyaṃ vidhīyate /	Consequently, it must be concluded that the sentence lays down a Substance Tail with reference to a qualified sacrifice the Patnīsamyāja.
nanvevamapi viśiṣṭa/nuvādātsutarāṃ vākyaṃ bhidyeta /	Objection But this too, being a reference to the qualified sacri tice, would involve a syntactical split. Reply That does not matter as the qualified Sacrifice is indicated, as such, by the Context, the word Patni not being meant to be speci ally significant.
prakaraṇāprāpteḥ patnīśabdasyātantratvādyathaivā bhikrāmaṃ juhotīti sāmānya śabdo'pyadhikārāt prayājaviṣayo bhavati /	Just as in the case of the sentence ‘abhikrāman juhoti even though the word used is the generic term juhoti meaning sacri fice in general, yet through capability of Context, the Abhikrāmaṇa is taken as pertaining to the pariticular sacrifice of the Prayajus,, in the same manner, the Patnisamyājas are to be taken as meant by the generic term samyajayanti.
tathaiva yatsaṃyājayantītyetāvataivādhikṛtāḥ patnīsaṃyājāḥ pratyeṣyante tasmādanutkarṣaḥ /	For these reasons, we conclude that the Tuil is not taken apart from the Context.
ekadeśa iti cet	Sutra Objection But the Tail is a part.
yadukta me kadeśadravyaścotpattau vidyamānasaṃyogādaprayojaka iti tatrocyate	It has been argued in the Purvapaksha that, inasmuch as the of it as related to something already existing, it could not be utilized, etc.,etc. And to this argument the Sūtra offers the following reply Sūtra Not so because the original DarçPūrņamāsa Jāghani, Tail is obtained by nonscriptural means.
saṃtadanaṃ pratīkrayaṇavada nartha lopāt syāt	Nor again is it necessary that it should he obtained from the gout as all that is laid down in the text is only the particular limb, Tail.
iha vākyaprakaraṇayorvirodhāvirodhacintā/	We now proceed to consider the cases of conflict and nonconflict between Syntactical Connection and Context.

With refer ence to the word Dirghasoma in this sentence, there arises a doubt, as to a whether it applies to the original sacrifice the Jyotishṭoma, as indicated by the Context, b or it applies to such sacrifices as extend over longer periods of time, and as such not being compatible with the ontext, has to be taken apart. On the point in question we can also take the following alternatives, a the word applies to the Jyotishtoma itself, b or to the Jyotishtoma ns performed by a tall Dīrghu yajamāna, c or to the Ukthu and other samsthās or parts of the Jyotishṭoma, d or to the Satra and Ahina sacrifices that extend over many days, e or to all sacrifices excepting the Agnishtomu which is the first samsthā of the Jyotishtoma. Because the word Diryhasoma is applicable to the Jyotishtoma as compared with such shorter sacrifices as the Ishți, the Paçü sacrifice, the DarviHomu and the like, because the purpose served by the joining together, the strength of the pounding slab, is quite applicable “ to the Jyotishṭoma, because the Injunction of notjoining together could be taken as an optional alternative to the joining together ,.

In this case we would construe the Sutra and the Bhashya in the following manner The objection beingInasmuch as the Jyotish toma sacrifice takes very little time to finish, there would not be much use in the said joining together of the pounding slabs being done in connection with that sacrifice,we have the replythat does not much affect the question, as the joining together will still have its use, like the Purchase.
asaṃtarddana vidhinā ca saha brohiyavavadvikalpasiddheḥ prakaraṇānugrahāyānutkarṣa iti / krayavaḍikalpa ityupariṣṭātsamuccaya sthāpanā tpūrvapakṣeṇa dṛṣṭānta iti vyākhyeyama /	That is to say, the actual price of the Soma not being very much, and its purchase having been accomplished by the payment of any one of the prescribed articlescloth and the restin exchange, one still gives to the owner all these articles, in keeping with the scriptural text laying down all these articles as to be given in exchange for the Soma and though the payment of these latter is not neces sary, yet it is not altogether useless, serving the purpose of still further winning the good graces of the owner because it is well known that the scriptures declare the fact of prosperity resulting from the pur chase of Somu, if effected to the entire satisfaction of its original owner.
na cāvaṇyaṃ sarvatra siddhānta eva dṛṣṭānto bhavati / yasya kasya cinnidarśanasya pratipattikāraṇatva siddheḥ	In the same manner, even though the unjoined slabs would be quite efficient for the pounding of the Soma for the Jyotishtomu, yet, inas much as we are cognizant of the fact that the pounding done on the strengthened slubs brings about prosperity, the joining together, done in accordance with the sentence under consideration, would not be entirely useless even in the Jyotishtoma.
utkarṣo vā grahaṇādviśeṣasya vākyakṛtādvā dīrghasomasaṃyogādutkarṣaḥ /	Sutra It should be taken apart because of the mention of the speciality. On account of the Syntactial Connection of the joining together with the Dirghasoma, the former must be taken apart from the Context. Because, an object is known as long Dirgha only when it is compared with another thing of the same kind, which is shorter than itself.
na hoṣṭipaśu darvihomāpekṣayā somasya dīrghatvaṃ yuktaṃ vijātīyatvādanupāttatvācca / sarvatra pratiyoginyupātte dīrghahasvādivibhāgo bhavati /	Consequently, one Somasacrifice could be known as Long, only in comparison with another Somasacrifice and it could not be spoken of, in comparison with such sacrifices as the Ishti, the Paçu, the Durvi homa and the like which have no connection with Soma because these latter do not belong to the same class as the Jyotishfoma and the other Somasacrifices, and because they are not spoken of in the Context and it is only when the two relative members of the comparison are mentioned that they are differentiated into the Long and the Short.
na cātreṣṭavādaya upāttā yānālocya jyotiṣṭomo dīrgha ityucyeta /	and in the case in question we do not find the Ishți,etc. mentioned, in comparison with which the Jyotishtomu could be spoken of as Long.

teṣāṃ kaḥ punarghaḥ kuto vā dīrgha ityapekṣite jyotiṣṭomastāvanna kutaśviddīrgha iti tato'nye gṛhyante teṣāṃ ca prāthamyātma evāpekṣākāraṇaṃ bhavati /	And then, when we come to consider which one of these Somasacrifices is the long one, and in comparison with which it is lo g, we find that the Jyotish toma is not longer than any of them and hence we come to take the word Dirghasoma ns referring to sacrifices other than the Jyotishtoma. And inasmuch as these other sacrifices are the first to be recognized as Long, the Joytishtoma comes to be recognized as the lower basis of the comparison.
kartṛto vā viśeṣasya tannimittatvāt	Sūtra Objection The speciality could be taken as pertaining to the performer as it is upon him that it is based.
yayā kathaṃ ciddīrghamomaśabde 'vakalpyamāne na yuktaḥ prakaraṇabādhaḥ	So long as we could interpret the word Dirghasoma in keeping with the indications of the Context, it is not proper to entirely reject this Context.

ṛtata eva dedhye samānādhikaraṇa samāsa ityarthaḥ	Nor would that make any difference in “ the accent, as regards the compound because in any case we have the acute accent upon the last syllable consequently we must expound the compound as the Genitive Tatpurusha Diryhanya purushasya Soma. Sutra Reply It must pertain to the sacrifice as, other.
dīrghe haskhe ca karttari karmaṇastulyarūpatvāddā caitahakarjā viśeṣaṇam/	wise, the two words could not have their own significations The epithet Long must pertain to the Sacrifice and not to the Sacrificer and the compound must be expounded as a Karmadharaya Dirghaçcāsau somaḥ.
svato viśeṣaṇaṃ tvantaraṅgam	What special reason have you got for taking the com Question pound thus ? Answer The chief reason is that it is only when the compound is thus explained that we have the direct significations of the component.
saṃsthāsu kartṛvaddhāraṇārthāviśeṣāt	Otherwise there would be no cause for desiring any extra durability in the slab, and consequently, the Injunction would not serve any useful purpose.
paricoḍhanāpadottarabhūtametatsūtram /	So also, the Arthuvāda contained in the word Dhṛtyai points to the propriety of our interpretation of the compound.

Then again, the specification of the sacrifice, through the Performer, would be extraneous to it, while that by itself would be more intimately related to it.
tasmāttisuṣvapi saṃsthāsu niveśa iti prakaraṇāviśeṣaḥ	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the joining together should be taken apart from the Jyotishtoma itself.
saṃtarddanasya punarnityenāgrahaṇātkevacā nitya vi ṣayatvaṃ na virudhyate /	This Sutra must be taken as urged by the opponent in reply to the following argument of the Siddhanta It is possible that the ‘joining together may not find a place in the first Samsthäthe Agnishtomaof the Jyotishtoma but it could pertain to the other samsthāstho Ukthya and the rest, which are longer than the Aguishṭoma, and by connecting with which, we keep our interpretation in keeping with the Context.
tasmātsaṃsthā niveśa ityukta 'bhidhīyate	Consequently we must admit that the joining together should have a place in the second and subsequent Samsthas sections of the Jyotishtoma. As against these arguments we have the above sütra, which formu lates the following.
satyapyatra karmakāntayodorghatve tāvānevātideśaprāpto daśamaṣṭiḥ somo 'bhiṣūyate dhāraṇasya tu tulyatvādṛṣṭārthavāḍha yoranupapattiḥ syāt/	Inasmuch as the quantity of soma used in every one of the sams thās is the same as in the Agnishṭoma, the work of the pounding too in every one of these would be exactly similar and hence the eulogy dhrtyai for the sake of making it strong and durable would be as useless in this interpretation, as in that in which the Perfomer is beld to be qualified by the epithet Dirgha. That is to say, though the subsequent samsthās take a longer time in performance than the first samstha, yet in every one of these, the quantity of soma pounded is only tenhandfuls, as per injunction daça mushṭirmimite which is applied, by implication, to every one of the samsthas of the Jyotishtoma.

But this could not be because we have the quantity of soma precise. ly limited by the direct declaration that it should be tenhandfuls of such pieces as have three joints consequently, if there be found to be increase in the number of the offerings to be made, the quantity of the juice should be increased by the addition of water and not by taking more of the soma itself. An Thus then the inexplicability of Dhrtyai being common in the case of all sumsthas, the joining together should be taken apart from the later samsthas also and hence from the whole Context of the Jyotish toma.
anityatvāditi niyataparimāṇatvasyāniyatatvāditi manyate na tvetadyuktam kutaḥ tantravārtika / agniṣṭomānyamātre hi dīrghaśabdovakalpate /	And as an increase in the num ber of offerings would mean a corresponding increase in the quantity of the substance to be offered, the Arthavāda contained in the word dhṛtyai would be quite explicable in this case. As for the assertion, that the quantity of somajuice would be increased by the addition of water,it is not admissible because inasmuch as the sacrifice is laid down as to be performed with the soma, no other substance could rightly be added to it, without the authority of a direct scriptural declaration to the effect.
athānyene tivattasmātsaṃsthā kratvantara grahaḥ	Conse quently under such circumstances, it would be the quantity of the soma itself that should have to be increased.
prakṛtivacchabdapūrṇatvācca na tāsāṃ prakaraṇamasti / na hyetad gṛhītaṃ prākṛtaṃ kiṃ ciḍhaṅgaṃ punaruccārya vidhīyate prathamopadigyamānajyotiṣṭomadharmamadhyapātitvāditaśca na saṃsthānāṃ prakaraṇamasti /	But then, this increase cannot be either in the thickness of the bundles or in the number of joints because of these two being restricted to tenhandfuls and three joints respective ly consequently, the only way in which the quantity of somajuice could be lawfully increased would be by getting hold of such pieces of the plant as have their joints at longer intervals than is ordinarily the case and in this manner we would have increased the quantity, and yet kept within bounds of the restrictions as to the measure of the soma, and also preserved the compatibility of the Context and the word Dirghasoma because the length of the pieces of the creeper would justify us in call ing the soma itself long. Sutra Objection The eulogy would be equally meaningless in both cases.] Sūtra It would be quite applicable to the case of the samsthas because of the restrictions not being univer sally applicable.
yadi hi saṃtarddanamukthyādīnvidhāyāvāntaraprakaraṇo śrūyeta tataḥ syādapi prakaraṇagrahaṇamidaṃ tu saṃsthādhikaraṇanyāyena tadagrāhau jyotiṣṭomadharmairantaritatvānna saṃsthākathaṃbhāvānuṣaṅgena saṃ spṛśyate /	actual performance the sense being that the quantity of soma could be increased in ways other than that shown above. But this explanation cannot be admissible because such increase would be impossible in the case of such sacrifices as the Satra and the Ahina. Consequently the word anityatvat must be taken as referring to the absence of restrictions in regard to the exact quantity of soma to be used in the Abhyüha laid down in the sentence Aviçishṭānamçünabhyü hết. In regard to the sentence ‘trtiyasavanē umçurēko grhyatë, there is a difference of opinion as this amçu portion has also got to be taken out of the same soma. Consequently the only means that we could rea sonably have for the increasing of the soma would be by taking such pieces as have the joints at longer intervals.
tasmānna prakaraṇaṃ saṃsthānaṃ vā saṃsthāsu viniyojakam/	For this reason also, the joining together should find place in the later samsthas of the Jyotishţoma. Then again, the place of the joining together should be restricted to these samsthas alone.
kiṃ taī vākyameva tacca dīrghasomatvāviśeṣātma cāhīnedhvapi tulyamiti sarvadharmatā	Because the word Dirghasoma applies to every one of the Somasacrifices, except the Agnishtoma and also because like the declaration ‘ ya ētēna,etc. the word applies to the later samsthās of the Jyotishtoma as well as to the other Somasacrifices.
naimittikaṃ vā kartṛsaṃyogālliṅgatantravārtike /	Or it may be that,inasmuch as in the KaushitakiBrāhmaṇa, it is in the JyutishtomaContext that we find the Pravargya laid down, in a certain order of sequence,the Bhashyastatement is based upon a refer ence to this fact.

yadi prathamaśabdoyaṃ nāma syāt jyotiṣaḥ svataḥ / tata evaṃ bhavedeṣa prayogakratuvācakaḥ	even before the Jyotishţoma,then alone could the Prohibition not be taken as pertaining exclusively to the Jyotishtomu. Sūtra It the First is conditionally relative, through the connection of the Performer because the Indicative Power of the word is actually determined by that. If the word Prathama First were a name of the Jyotishțoma it self, then what has been said in the Purvapaksha would be quite admis sible.

tannāma viśeṣavacanenopasaṃhiyate yat ṛtusaṃyomāyāsamarthaṃ kathaṃ citparokṣavṛttyā saṃyujyate yathā sāptadaśyam	Thus then, the word First having been shown to be denotative of the first operation, if it be applied, by indirect indication, to that which has that firstness as its qualification the Jyotishtoma sacrifice f. i., then that would involve a certain degree of remoteness of the word from its objective and this remoteness can be admissible only in such cases where no syntactical connection is found to be possible without it e.g.

yadi gacchettata iṣṭipaśubandhānapi gacchenna va gantumarhati purastādupasadāmiti /	Otherwise, if it were made relative to other sacrifices further removed from the First Performance of the Jyotishtoma, then that would involve a great remoteness of the relationship. For these reasons, we must reject the Context, and taking our stand upon Syntactical Connection, hold the Prohibition of the Pravargya to apply to the First Performance only of the Jyotishtoma i.e. only to the Agnishtomaportion of it. . In the Taittiriya text, we find a further Injunction of the Pravargya, in the sentence ‘Agnishṭomē pravrņakti.

And as a matter of fact, the method of the injunctions of all samsthas is similar and we do not find any prohibition in the subcon text, and the sentence cannot be taken as connected with the words Prakrtivad vikrtiḥ kartavya as used with reference to the Atiratra, which separated from it by the intervention of all the other sentences dealing with the Jyotishtoma.
tasmādutpatti viniyogābhyāmevāpunaruktatva, mevaṃ sati yeṣāṃ prakaraṇaeva pravargyapāṭhastaiḥ saha saṃgatārthatā bhaviṣyati /	Objection What you assert could be reasonable, only if it served the same purpose in connection with both the Original and its Modifica “tion as a matter of fact, however, it serves distinct purposes as with reference to the Original Jyotishtoma it is wholly optional while with reference to the Atiratra, the Prohibition is absolutely necessary.

Reply This objection does not hold because while this latter sen tence yat pravargyam,etc. would serve as the Originative Injunction of the Pravargya, the other sentence Agnishtome pravrnakti would lay down its particular application thus serving as its Viniyogavidhi and thus there would be two distinct purposes served by the two sentences. Or, the sentence ‘yat pravargyam,etc. could be taken as serving the pur pose of laying down the Pravargya in connection with the sacrifices other than the Agnishtoma.

For these reasons, the two sentences being an Originative Injunction and an Injunction of Application respectively, they cannot be taken as the mere repetitions of each other.
satyaṃ prāptasya punarvacanaṃ tāvanmātraphalamanarthakamiti sāmarthyāt prakarṣagatirvijñāsyate /	For these reasons, we must explain the Siddhanta in the following manner The sentence yaḥ pravargyam,etc. having been shown to be applicable to the original sacrifice, the sentence Agnishțomē pravṛṇakti found to be of no other use, comes to be taken as calculated to serve the purpose of pointing out the occasional allowability of what has been pro.

tana prathamayajñaiti pratiṣedhādanagniṣṭomatvena ca pratiprasavābhāvānnityameva na karttavyaḥ/	In this case we find that the prohibition na prathamayajnë,etc. is quite applicable to it and then not being Agnishtoma, it is not subject to the declaration of the allowability of the performance in the sentence Agnish tome,etc. consequently it comes to be concluded that the Pravargya should never be performed in the Atiratra.
vikṛtyantareṣu prathamaprayogānupapatternityameva karaṇam /	As for the other modifications of the Jyotishtoma, inasmuch as none of these would be first performances, the Prohibition could not apply to them and hence it would be absolutely necessary to perform the Pravargya in connection with these.

Sutra But it should apply to the grain only because in the case of the Cake, it is necessarily implied by the useful purpose served by it and in the case of the animal body, it could not apply to it, because of incongruity. Some people might urge that Inasmuch as the Cake could be made even if the grinding done wore of the ordinary kind not the Vedic one, the Vedic grinding could not be necessarily implied by the very nature of the Cake and the purpose served by the grinding as declared in the Sutra.

In the case of the animal body, there would be a deficiency in the character of the Primary offering. Because the primary offering has been recognized as being in the shape of the Heart,etc. and this could be done only by cutting these limbs out of the body.
na ca piṣṭe tadākṛtikādavadīyeta punastadākārakaraṇepi mṛdgavayādivaṅgauṇādavadīyamāne vaiguṇyameva /	But when the body would be ground down, the necessary shapes would be no longer there, and so the offerings could not be cut out off the masses of those shapes. Even though it might be possible to make those shapes out of the pounded mass of flesh, yet in this case the names Heart and the rest would apply to these newlyshaped masses of flesh only secondarily, just like the name gavaya to the animal made of clay and that causes a deficiency in the offering.
na ca hṛdayāde piṣṭasya jñāyeta katareṇa pradeśenedaṃ paśorutkṛttamiti /	Then again, we have the declaration that the piece is to be cut out from that region in which it has been torn from the body and when the Heart, etc, have been ground down, it could not be known by which particular part it had been torn from the body of the animal.

Objection Inasmuch as the condition that has been laid down for the grindingviz.

tena svakrama sthasyaiva preṣaṇasya vidhiḥ /	Consequently, the Injunction must be taken to be of the grinding of that alone which happens to be in due order for it.
upanītamātrameva ca peṣaṇaṃ puroḍāśe 'nuvādabuddhyā gṛhyate / carau ca nivarttamānaṃ pratiprasavatvena paśau punaratyantāprāptavidhitvena /	When the sentence under consideration is taken with reference to each of the three kinds of offering materials, it leads to the following conclusions in regard to the Cake, being necessarily implied by its usefulness, the mention of grinding would be the mere recalling of a previ ous fact in regard to the Grain, it would serve as laying down the allowability of the grinding in this particular case of the offering being meant for Püshan and in regard to the AnimalBody, it could only be taken as the injunction of something wholly new.

katham /	Sūtra Objection In the case of the Grain also.
gatiḥ sarvapadārthānāṃ laukika vyavahārataḥ /	There is no incongruity of purpose in the case of the Grain. Because the condition of all things is determined by ordinary experience and it is a matter of ordinary experience that it is a certain cooked preparation that is called Ouru cooked grain.
tatra pākaviśeṣaśca carutvenā vadhāryate	Now then, there arises the question as to whether the Grinding is to be done also when the offering of that Carn is meant for two Deities Indra and Pushan,or only when it is meant for Pushan alone.
pakṣoktaṃ prayojanamiti mandaṃ phanamuktam / etāvāntamamādhiḥ aviśeṣepina puroḍāśārtha tvaṃ prayojanaṃ kiṃ tarṣi paścarthatvamiti	Inasmuch as we find the sentence, under consideration, which lays down the grinding, speaking of Pushan alone as having his share ground, the Grinding would apply to that Caru alone which is dedicated to and meant for Pushan only.
dharmavipratiṣedhāca	Sūtra Also because of the incongruity involved in the particular action when applied to any other Caru.

If the latter, then the cooking of it would be deranged and if the former, the two shares would get hopelessly mixed up. That is to say, if only half of the Caru were ground and the other half left unground, the ground half would become cooked very much sooner than the other half consequently, if the whole thing would be removed from the oven as soon as the ground half would be ready cooked, then the other half would remain uncooked while if we were to wait for this latter to become ready cooked before removing the vessel from the oven, then by that time the ground half would become melted off in a single mass of flour.
nanu caitatsarvaṃ dvidevatyeṣu bhavatopi samānaṃ tathā hi sa cāṅgīkṛto miśrasya haviṣo miśra devatoddeśena yugapaddāne virodhābhāvāt	But in that case the simultaneity of the cooking of the offering material meant for the two deities conjointly would disappear. Then, lastly, if for the sake of Pushan, Indras share were also ground, then the two shares would get hopelessly mixed up and if the portion of one Deity happened to be offered to another, that would mean a great anomaly in the sacrifice.
yāgāpūrva prayukteṣu dharmeṣvevaṃ bhavedidam / bhavataḥ peṣaṇaṃ tvetaddevatādharma saṃmatam	Objection What you say now would apply to your theory also, as regards those offerings that are meant for two Deities conjointly. Be canse in the case of the Oaru, or the Animal Body, or the Cake, being offered to two Deities,before the offering is actually made, there is one whole mass of the substance to be offered and thus certainly there is a mixture of the portions of various Deities.
na ca tad didevatye tathāvasthitamityapravṛttireva /	And in fact you admit of this mixing up of the portions, on the ground that there is no incon “gruity in the mixedup offerings being simultaneously made to the joint Deities.
havirantareṣvapi ca hidevatyeṣvevaṃ prakāratvameveti devatā guṇabhūtā	In fact, in the case of other kinds of offering materials also meant for two Deities, the conditions are the same e. the peculiarities in the material are meant to aid in the bringing about of the particular Apürvus and as such the Deity is always the secondary element.
bhavatā punarasadabhyupagamena dvidevatye peṣaṇaṃ vaktumaśaknuvatā 'vaśyaṃ devatānimittatantravārtika /	Conse quently, inasmuch as there can be no repetition of the Principal factor for the sake of the secondary, it is held that even in such cases of two Deities the actual offering is made once only and hence the Portions of all the Deities jointly being offered all at once, there is no harm done by the mixture in the final Apurva, which is the only result of the offering, according to our view.
tu tvamabhyupagantavyam /	For you, on the other hand, it is not possible to speak of the grinding as we have done i.e.
tataśca devatayoḥ prādhānyāde kekā svabhāgamasaṃkīrṇaṃ prārthayataiti tathaiva dānamanuṣṭheyam	as helping in the bringing about of the Apūrva and hence you must take it as due to the particu lar Deity. And in that case, the Deities being the Principal element, each would want its portion separately and the offering also would have to be made accordingly. And from the very beginning, it has been a settled fact that there is only one Portion that meant for Püshan that has to be ground and thus there would be the anomaly in cooking as shown above.
tatrānyasya bhā mādanyama avadīyamāne vaiguṇyaṃ bhavati	It may be suggested thateven that portion which is meant to be in whole grains of rice could be ground down, for the sake of the uni formity in cooking.
carumiti yāgaṃ pratyupādīyamānatvena vivakṣitaikasaṃkhyasya pātrakṛtabhedāśrayaṇe śāstravādhaprasaṅgā, dato na kathaṃ cidapi pratiṣidvadharmakaṃ dvidevatye peṣaṇaṃ bhavatīti na kartavyam	But when the differentiation has been made, inasmuch as the Portions could not be mixed up again unless we actually had a text authorizing such mixing up, it becomes absolutely necessary to offer the Portions separately and in that case, if the portion of one Deity were offered to another, there would be a great anomaly in the sacrifice. Nor could it be urged that the two portions the ground and the unground would be cooked in separate vessels. Because the Veda lays down the Caru as the material to be offered, in the words Carum,etc. where Carum being the object enjoined, its number the singular could not but be regarded as significant consequently if it were put into two vessels, there would be two Carus, which would involve a contradiction of the said scriptural text.
haviṣo yadi poṣṇasya tadyāgāṅgasya vā bhavet / anuktatvād dvidevatye na bhavetyeṣaṇaṃ tataḥ	Because if the grinding were laid down either for that offering which is meant for Püshan alone, or for that which forms part of the sacrifice to Püshan then, in that case, there could have been no grinding in regard to the Caru meant for two Deities, on account of its not being declared to be for that purpose. for the Grinding is the presence of Püshun, and not any substance qualified by that Deity.
tenāsatyapyatra pūṣṇo devatātve samavāyamātreṇopanakṣaṇatvād iyoddeśenāpi ca tyajyamānasya samaṃ yādaśrutatvādityanena nyāyeṃnā pūṣṇo bhāga iti gamyate	Then, inasmuch as the character of the Deity of a sacrifice is pervasive that is, the Deific character pervades as one complete whole over both Deities in a TwoDeity sacrifice, thongh the sacrifice which has two Deities Indra and Pushan could not be spoken of as one qualified by Pũshan as its Deity, yet by this it is not meant that either Pushan, or his Portion, does not exist in connection. with that sacrifice as will be declared in connection with the Manotā in Adhyayu X that though Agni is not its Deity, yet that does not mean that he does not inhere in it.
athāpi kiṃ na etenāśrutena kṛtenetyevamamātrapeṣaṇa mevādhyavasīyate tathāpi kena citkauśalena pākasaṃpādanayogapadyaniśśepapācaikatvayorvā guṇatvādara bāgha iti nirūpya kārya me va peṣaṇamiti	If, however, it be found undesirable to do something the grinding of Indras portion not directly laid down, and it be concluded to grind only the Half meant for Pushan,even then, the proper cooking of both the ground and the un ground grain could be done by some clever stroke of the culinary art. Or, we could very legitimately do away with the necessity of the minor details of the fact of the cooking of both being simultaneous, or that of both being cooked in the same vessel and thus we should do the “grinding of Pãshas portion even in the case of the Oaru being meant for both Iudra and Püshan. It has been argued above under Sütra that the Laws of the Chaturdhākaraṇa and that of Indrapita would apply to the case in ques tion and the performance of the grinding would be limited by the words of the sentence laying it down.
tatrābhidhīyate	And to this we make the following reply As for the compound in Indrapita and the word formed by a nominal affix i.e.
tenāgneyendrapīta śabdābhyāṃ samarthāgnīndragrāhibhyāṃ videvatyāgrahaṇaṃ yukta, miha punaḥ pūṣapadasyāsamāsabhākkāt prapiṣṭabhāgaśabdayośca sāpekṣepi pūṣaṇi sāmarthyāvighātāt na kiṃci d duṣyatītyupaścajaṇatā	Āgnēya, these can never appear in connection with such words as are incapable of affording the sense required consequently in the case of the use of such words, we do not admit the capability of the word expressive of one Deity referring to that which belongs to two Deities. That is to say, in the case of the words Āgnēya and Indrapita, we find that they are fully capable of referring to Agni and Indra respectively, and as such cannot in any case refer to that which belongs to two Deities but in the sentence under consideration we find that the word Pusha does not occur in a com pound, and hence there is no exclusive capability belonging to it hence even though the compound Prapishṭabhāgaḥ is dependent upon something else, yet a reference to the Caru meant for two Deities does not deprive the word Pusha of any recognized capability and hence there can be nothing objectionable in speaking of the offering meant for Indra and Pushan as one meant for Püshan.
vacanātsarvapeṣaṇaṃ taṃ prati śāstravattvādarthābhāvāddhi carāvapeṣaṇaṃ bhavati	Sutra Also because we perceive an Indicative Force. The reason for grinding that is given is because Püshan is with out teeth and this clearly indicates that the Grinding depends upon, and is conditioned by, the Deity. And certainly Püshan does not becomie endowed with teeth, when joined by another Deity hence the condition for grinding remaining intact in the latter case also, it is necessary to do the Grinding.
vidhitvānnemapiṣṭatvamaniṅga viparyayasādhanaṃ cetyata āāha	And that this is the right course is also indicated by the fact of the presence of the Deity being laid down as the sole condition for having recourse to Grinding.
tadyadi tāvadyaścaruḥ sa nemapiṣṭa iti vidhīyate tataḥ sarvaca viṣayāvadhāraye sati somā pauṣṇaśabda ekaṭeśānuvādonarthakaḥ syāt /	either to the Caru, or to Somāpaushna and with reference to which soever of these two the injunction would be made, that could not be qualified by the other, and hence the grinding would come to have an universal application and as such all the offerings would have to be ground and in that case one of the two words Caru or Somāpaush na would become useless. That is to say, if we were to take the Injunction as that which is the Caru should be halfground, then the grinding coming to be recognised as applying to all Carus, the word Somi paushna, as referring to only one of the Carus, would become useless.
atha somāpauṣṇamātramuddiśyate tatopi sarvapeṣaṇameva saddevatyahavi rmātrapratītyā paśupuroḍāśayorapi grahaṇāt /	If, on the other hand, the Injunction be interpretted as that that which is Somipaushna should be halfground, then, too, the Grinding would come to apply to all offeringmaterials because all that the word Somapaushna would indicate would be the character of being meant for the joint Deity SomaPüshan and this would be equally applicable to the Cake and the Animal Body also just as much as to the Caru and thus the word Carum would become absolutely useless.
taṃ prati hi somāpauṣṇamaviśeṣitaṃ pratipeṣaṇasya śāstravatvaṃ viśeṣaṇārthābhāvāt /	Specially would such be the case, because with reference to thati.e. with reference to the Somapaushna even when unqualified by Caru the grinding would be scripturally authorised,as no useful purpose would be served by the qualification.
etasminpakṣe carāvapeṣaṇaṃbhavati	In fact, in accordance with this view, there would be no grinding of the Caru.
na cātyantākatirnaśyena cotsādadeśamohaḥ syāditarotmādadeśasya spaṣṭatvena ca piṣṭopi san pūṣabhāga upacacyate na sarvapreṣaṇavanmuhyeta /	Reply Not so because none of these objections is found to apply to the case in question because all that we do, on finding the sentence laying down the grinding of all offering materials, is to take the ‘half grinding as enjoined in connection with the Cake and certainly even by being half cooked, the Cake remains intact. And as for the Heart and the other limbs of the Animal Body, if we were to grind the whole of these, except that part by which they may have been torn from the body,there would be none of the incongruities shown above nor would their shape be wholly destroyed nor would there be any mistaking of the part by which they may have been torn from the Body.
atha vāsminpace vācanikatvādadṛṣṭārthe peṣaṇe satya piṣṭādevāvadīyeta /	Or, it may be that, in accordance with this view, inasmuch as the grinding, being based upon verbal authority, would serve only an imper ceptible purpose, the cutting of the Heart,etc. would be done before the Grinding.
naci tadaitaddevatānimittaṃ peṣaṇaṃ syāt /	And this grinding would not depend upon the presence of a Deity.
tasmātmārvatrikatva prasaṅgānna pariśeṣasiddhaṃ caroḥ peṣaṇamiti tacchra tira narthikā prāpnotyeveti carudevatāsaṃbandhavidhipare vākye nemapiṣṭatvamatṛtīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pāda / ndhana ityavaśyamabhyupagantavyam	Thus then, inasmuch as the grinding would apply to all materials, it could not be taken as applying exclusively to the Caru and hence its mention in the sentence somapaushnan carum,etc. would be wholly useless. Consequently it must be admitted that this sentence enjoin ing the relationship of the Oaru with the Deity SomaPüshan, the halfgrinding, is merely spoken of by way of reference aud not as an object of Injunction. Sutra It pertains to one only because it is meant to belong to the resultant Apūrva consequently, it could not belong to both, just as in the case of the Aindrāgna. We could have the grinding only when Pushan alone would be the Deity, and not when he would be joined by another Deity.
na hyeṣa devatādharmo na tadbhāgasya gamyate / pūṣadevatyayāgārthaṃ dharmastveṣa pratīyate	Because the grinding does not belong either to the Deity, or to his portion in fact it is laid down as a detail belonging to the sacrifice of which Pushau is the Deity. That is to say, before the offering has actually been made there is no Portion Bhaga of the Deity, to which the Grinding could belong. Specially as the material becomes the portion of a Deity, not merely by being offered to him, but by being accepted by him.
karmasādhano hi bhāgaśabdo bhajyataiti bhāgaḥ sevyataityarthaḥ	And further, the word Bhaga Portion is made up of the root bhaj with the affix ghan, in the Accusative sense,it being etymologically explained · bhajyalē = sēvyatë yuḥ suḥ bhāgaḥ = that which is accepted conse quently that which is accepted by one is his Bhaga Portion.
na ca haviraṃśa devatā bhajame bhoktṛtvasya navame niṣedhāt / athāpi bhajettathāpi tasyāḥ prayojakatvaṃ tatraiva nivārayiṣyate /	And as a matter of fact we do not find the Deity actually accepting the offering specially as the fact of the Deity actually partaking of the offering will be re futed later on, in Adhyāya IX. In fact, even if the Deity were to accept it, yet, it could not have the capability of introducing an accessory, as also will be shown in Adhyaya IX under the Sütra IXi et seq.. The author of the Bhashya has also referred to the same fact of the grinding being an accessory of the sacrifice, by denying that of its belonging to the Deity.

That is to say, inasmuch as the Syntactical Connection of the sentence Pusha prapishtabhayaḥ,etc. refers to the Deity and not to the sacrifice, and as without Context there could be no indication of the means of accomplishing the Apūrva, there can be no connection of the grinding with either the sacrifice or “the Apūrva.” The reply to this as given in the Bhashya is By means of Syn turtical Connection we are led to this cognition.
tatra vākyasaṃyogādityukte pareṇa svābhiprāye vivṛte bhāgaśabdenaiva mukhyārthāsaṃbhavādyāgopādānamiti darśayati /	She The opponent retorts by further pointing out what he means And in reply to this, the Bhashya explains the word bhaga in the sentence as signifying the sacrifice, on the ground of the principal signification of the word not being found compatible with the rest of the sentence.
parasvakhokaraṇātmakasya bhāgarūpasyāvidyamānatvā, dyasta duddeśena tyajyamānatvanāmāṃśī vidyate tena yāgo lacyate, sa caikadevatye tantravārtike /	That is to say, inasmuch as, in the case in question, there is no such Bhaga as consists in the acceptance of something offered by another, that factor of this action which consists in the mere act of the offering must indicate the sacrifice and as this is quite possible in that sacrifice which has Pushan alone for its Deity, the mention of it as the Bhäga of Pushan becomes quite compatible.
pūṣaviśiṣṭeo bhavatīti tadbhāgavyapadeśo ghaṭate, dvidevatye pu narvyāsaṅgo miśraḥ saṃkalponyatareṇa vyapadeṣṭumaśakya iti /	But this latter name cannot apply to that sacrifice which has two Deities because the deific character is pervasive in its character, and the words conveying the offering to both are inseparably mixol up and consequently the sacrifice could not be named after any one of those two Deities.

Though we say nothing as to the difficulty that would arise in explaining the compound as shown above, yet inasmuch as the very signification of the word bhāga is not found to be applicable to the Aindrāpaushna offering, the word Püshabhāga cannot be applied to this latter. Though, when two entities come to have the nature of the Deity, each of them could be spoken of as the Deity, yet, inasmuch as in the word couveying the offering, they are not mentioned by the name of any one of them, we conclude that the TwoDeity sacrifice cannot be spoken of as Pashabhāga.
hetumālamadantatvam	Sutra The absence of teeth is a mere supplementary reason.
yattvadantako hoti hetunidarśanāddevatādharmatvamiti / tatrocyate	It has been argued by the opponent that “the mention of the reason because he is without teeth shows that the grinding is an accessory of the Deity. And to this we offer the following reply The sentence because he is without teeth is an Arthavāda having a form indicative of supplementary or corroborative reason and as such it is only meant to be an eulogy of the particular accessory in question viz.
vacanaṃ param	Sutra The other is an injunctive sentence.
nemapiṣṭādiṣu prāptyabhāvādvacanaṃ bhaviṣyati	Inasmuch as the halfgrinding has never been found to have been enjoined elsewhere, the sentence Somapaushnam,etc. would be an Injunction and not merely indicative of the fact of the grinding applying to the Caru meant for the two deities Soma and Pushan. And as the object of the Injunction is a qualified one, there would be no syntactical split.
aviśiṣṭa vidhiṃ cāpekṣya viśiṣṭavidhirṭarbalo bhavati na tvatrāsāvasti	As a matter of fact, it is only in comparison with an unqualified Injunction that the qualified Injunction could be said to be less authoritative in the case in question however there is no unqualified Injunction consequently the sentence in question cannot be taken as merely indicative and not injunctive.
iti śrīmahakumārila svāmiviracite tantravārttike tṛtīyādhyāyasya tṛtīyaḥ pādaḥ samāptaḥ	For these reasons the Grinding must be taken as pertaining to the Portion of a single Deity. PĀDA IV.
nivītamiti manuṣyadharmaḥ śabdasya tatpradhānatvāt	Sūtra The mention of Nivita is meant to be a pro perty of Man because the word has that for its predom inant factor.

That the Bhashya has introduced this question here is simply by way of taking for granted and putting forward something, for the purpose of introducing a discussion as it is found that unless mentioning the nivita as the property of Man, etc.,etc. And what the Bhashya does is to admit, for the sake of argument, and assert that the sentence is an Injunction, to deal with subjects immediately con nected with the matter of the Adhyāya, and to sum up with the conclusion that the sentence is an Arthavada.
pareṣvapyadhikaraṇeṣvetadyathāsaṃbhavaṃ yojayitavyam /	The connection of this introduction of the question of Injunction and Arthavada with the other Adhikaraṇas also, may be explained in the same manner.
tantravārtike /	The sentence is an Injunction, in accordance with the sūtra ii .
teṣāṃ svatvena tatpratīyate na manuṣyāstadaṅgatvena / guṇavibhaktinimābhāvāt /	And hence, in accordance with the conclusion arrived at in the Ahinadhikaraṇa Iiii, the genitive in manushyāṇām directly denotes the fact of the nivīta being a property of Man because it is cognised as belonging to him, while the Man is not cognised as an of that as the declensional ending attached to Man, Manushya does not denote the subsidiary character.
satyāṃ naiva manuṣyagrahaṇaṃ kriyeta, kṛtaṃ caitat, atopi manuṣyadharma ityavagacchāmaḥ	As the mere existence of Man, as its accessory, would have been necessarily implied by the very nature of the Action, there should have been no mention of him but as we do find him mentioned, we conclude that the Nivīta is the property of Man.
vidhistvapūrvavatvātsyāt	accessory Sutra Objection The sentence is merely descriptive because the object Nivita already exists.
kutaḥ /	Object.
pūrvavattvāyanuvādo bhavedatyantaprāptāvityarthaḥ /	Sutra Reply It is an Injunction as it speaks of something wholly now. The sentence is an Injunction because it would have been merely Descriptive only if the object spoken of were already fully known to be as it is here spoken of.
na cāyamatyanta prāptaḥ / tena vināpyavyagratāyāḥ śakyatvāt kaṇṭhavandhaḥ punaḥ prāyeṇāprāpta evetyasti niyama vidheravakāśaḥ	As a matter of fact, however, it is not fully known as such because even without the careful winding up the removal of hindrance would be possible. siztrut Because of the fact of the Nivita being men tioned in a context abounding in the mention of the pro perties of Actions,this also would be a property of Ac “tions.” The Nivita is a property of the Action because while being men tioned in an Injunction, it is found in a context that abounds in the mention of such Properties as belong to Actions.
vākyasya śeṣavatvāt	Sūtra Specially because of the peculiar nature of the closing words of the sentence.
dvedhā saṃbhave tādṛśī pramāṇagatirāśrayaṇīyā yā pramāṇāntaraṃ na bādhate yajurvedāmnānācca nivītāderādhvaryavasamākhyopavaddhaṃ vākyam/	Whenever we find a certain thing capable of being taken in two different ways, we should take it in accordance with that means of knowledge which may not be found to be contradictory to another means of knowledge.And in the case in question, we find that being mentioned in the Yajurveda, the sentence dealing with the Nivīta, etc., is connected with the name of Adheuryuva.
tatra yadi karmadharmeyaṃ tataḥ kartṛviśeṣātṛtīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	Consequently if the Nivita were the property of an Action, then, whenever we would look for its performer, the said Name would point to the Adheuryn priest as thus alone could the Name serve a useful purpose.
manuṣyadharmāṇāṃtuna samākhyā niyāmiketi vacyāmaḥ	And we shall show later on that the Name could not serve any such purpose with regard to the Properties of Man. Consequently, if the Nivita were the property of Man, the operation of the Name would be rejected as useless while it is duly honoured if the Nivita is taken as the property of the Action as shown above.
tatprakaraṇe yattatsaṃyukta mavipratiṣedhāt	Sūtra It is connected with that which appears in the same Context as there would be no incongruity in this.
prathamaṃ tāvanmanuṣyadharmabalīyasvena karmadharmatvaṃ nirākaroti /	As a At first we seek to reject the theory of the Nivita being a property of Actions, by showing the superior autoritative character of the theory of its being a property of Man because in this way, the theory being put forward by easy stages, it would be easy to accept it later on.
śrutvā hi prakaraṇasamākhye bādhitvā manuṣyadharma eva prāpnoti/	matter of fact, we find that the Direct Denotation of manushyāṇäm sets aside the indications of the said Context and Name, and distinctly points to the fact of the Nivila being a property of Man.

ata eṣa vākyārtho yadi manuṣyāṇāṃ karma tatra nivyātavyamiti	The opponent putting the questionHow do you make this out ? and the Bhashya having given the answerbecause of the relationship of the genitive ending in manushyaṇam,the opponent again retorts this genitive ending points to the Nivita as belonging to Man and not to any Action.
tulyavaddhi prasaṃkhyānaṃ dṛśyate sminnidhitraye /	is the predominant factor.
tasmānnarapradhāne syātpitṛdevapradhānavat	This connecting of the Nivita with such an Action would have the further advantage of not standing in need of the assumption of any result not connected with the Nivita itself.
arthavādo vā prakaraṇāt	Sutra It is an Arthavāda, because of the Context.
sarvathā nācaikopi pakṣo nirdoṣaḥ/	We find none of the above theories free from objectionable features.
prakaraṇasaṃbandhe vākyasaṃbandhavādhādanvācāryādisaṃbandhe vākyabhedātprakaraṇasya ca viśeṣakatvānupapattera tithyādisaṃbandhotyantanirmūla eva/ ṣaḍbhirapi śra tyādibhirasaṃ yarthāt manuṣyasaṃbandhena tadanumīyate /	In the first piace, if the Nirita be connected with the Action men tioned in the Context as declared in Sutra , it directly contradicts the Indications of Syntactical Connection while its connection with the actions of Anvāhāryapacana,etc. would involve a syntactical split and in this theory there would be a further disadvantage, in that the Context cannot serve the purposes of specification attributed to it. Secondly, as for its connection with such actions as the attending upon guests as laid down under Sutra , there can be no reasonable ground for it inasmuch as such a connection would not be amenable to any one of the means of right notion, from among Direct Declaration,etc. in fact even its staunchest upholder only infers it from the relationship of Man expressed by the word manushyāṇām and this would be scarcely right because that genitive in manushyāṇām is cognised as being based upon the distinctive relationship of that action which is connected with the word nivita specially as no caseendings appear in a case where a distinctive relationship of the member related is not expressed.
tacca na yutam /	Then again, we do not find an Injunctive word in the sentence in question.
tasyā api ṣaṣdyā nivotapaṭasaṃbandhivyatirekajanitatvapratoteḥ /	And under the circumstances the sentence could be taken as an Injunction, only if we supplied the Injunctive word from without, or if we could somehow or other assume the Injunctive, found in connection with the duties of attending upon guests and the like, to per tain to the sentence in question also.
na hyanupāttasaṃbandhivyatireke vibhakta utpadyante / tasmānmanuṣyārthataiva prāpnoti /	But no such assumption can be admissible as we cannot assume anything to be the subsidiary, when it has not been laid down as such and that which is not a subsidiary is incapable of being taken up by the sentence declaring the performance of the whole action as we shall show later on that that which is not enjoined as such cannot be an accessory and in this way the assumption of the accessory character would depend upon that of the Injunction, and vice versa, thus involving a hopeless mutual interdependence.
tatrāpi ca prakaraṇasamākhyānādhaphalakalpanāprasaṅgaḥ / sati ca gatyantarena yuktaṃ tadāśrayaṇamasti caudumbarādhikaraṇasidvamarthavādatvaṃ gatiḥ	Then again, so long as we find the sentence in question capable of being, in some way or other, syntactically connected with an actual Injunction, it is not right to connect it with an assumed one specially as such a theory would involve the assumption of many invisible transcen dental purposes. For these reasons the property of things distinctly shows that the sen tence in question is an Arthavada, a Praise, its meaning beingJust as the Nivita and the Pracinivita are good for Men and the Pitrs respec tively, so is the Uparītu for the Gods in fact we meet with such instances in ordinary parlance also,e.g.
ataḥ paraṃ ṣaṭ sūtrāṇi bhāṣyakāreṇa na likhitāni satra vyākhyātārī vivadante / ke cidāivistāni /	say After this there follow six Sutrus which we do not find mentioned in the Bhashya. And there is a difference of opinion among the Commenta tors, as to this omission a Some people say he forgot them b others that he wrote commentaries upon these Satras also but this portion of the Bhasliya has become lost to us c some say he found them easy and not of much importance, and hence omitted them d while others declare that he omitted them because they are not the work of Jaimini.
likhito gra ndhaḥ pracīna ityapare / phalgutvādupekṣitānītyanye /	In support of this last theory we have the form of Sutra , which distinctly shows that Jaimini had this latter Sûtra immediately after Sutra .
anārpeyatvādityapare /	Sūtra A The Upavita would pertain to all sacrifices, be cause of the presence of Indicative Force.
tathā ca digvibhāgaśca tahaditi nivītādhikarapānideśaḥ tadānantaryādupapadyata iti / vṛttyantarakāraistu duttāḥ	The first question to be dealt with is this We have found in the preceding Adhikaraṇa that the Upavila method has been enjoined in con nection with the DarçaPürṇamāsa and with regard to this there arises the question as to whether this Injunction applies to the DarçaPürna māsa only, or to all the sacrifices. Those however who divide the Sätras into three Adhikaranas, state the question aswhether it pertains to the DurçaPurnamāsa alone, and is an Injunction, or that it pertains to all sacrifices, and is merely des criptive.
kiṃ prāptaṃ sarvadharmaḥ syāt /	The Upavita would belong to all sacrifices.
mṛtāgnihotre hi pihṛdevatye śrūyate prācīnāvīto dohayet / yajñopavītī hi devebhyo dohayatīti / tadyadi sarvārthamupavītaṃ tato'yaṃ pitrye 'gnihotrasambandhī nityavata yajñopavītānuvādo 'vakalpate /	Because the mere des cription of this, which is cognized as an established fact, pertaining to other sacrifices, would, through Indicative power, subdue the indica tions of the Context, by means of Apparent Inconsistency. That is to say, in connection with Mrtagnihotra, of which the Deity is the Pitr the Agnihotri Father who has died, we find the mantra Prācīnaviti dohayēt, yajñopavīti hi dēvēbhyo dohayati. And it is only if the Upavita be taken as pertaining to all sacrifices, that we could have the descriptivo declaration in the latter half of the sentence which speaks of the Upavīta as pertaining to all sacrifices to the gods.
na cāyaṃ darśapūrṇamāsasthasyaivānuvādaḥ vi prakṛṣṭatvāt/ hetuvannigadārthavādānarthakyācca /	Nor can this sentence be taken as merely descriptive of something pertaining to the DarçaPūrṇamāsa only as the Context of this latter sacrifice is very far removed from the one just quoted and specially as in that case the descriptive declaration dēvēbhynḥ, etc., which appears in the form of showing a reason for what has been said before, would be of no use.
yadi hi tasmiva karmaṇyanyāvastheyaṃ dharmo bhavati tataśca tadavasthā parijihīrṣayā hetuvannigado 'vakalpate /	declaration would serve the purpose of pointing out something preclu sive of that particular condition of the same sacrifice.
na tu kratvantarasthaṃ parivarttavyamatyanta viprakarṣevāprasaktatvāta / na ca devebhya iti bahuvaca naṃ darśapūrṇamāsayoravakalpate /	Nor can it be uecessary for the sentence to preclude those conditions from any other sacrifice that of the DarçaPūrṇamāsa f.i. because this latter is itself so very much removed by the Context, that there is no need of any special effort for the preclusion of any conditions pertaining to it. Then again, the Plural number in derebhyaḥ could not be reconciled with a reference to the DarçaPürnamāsa which has only one Deity while in regard to the Agnihotra, the Plural is found to be quite com patible with the number of the Deities connected with its morning and evening Libations.
vaikalpikendra mahendra kadevatyatvāt mānāvyaya /	c.
tasmādagnihotrasthopavītānuvādānyathānupapatteḥ sarvadharmatvamiti na vā sarvadharmaḥ /	Sutra B Not so because of the Context and as for the Indicative Power that points to that particular sacrifice the DarçaPürnamāsa. The Upavita does not pertain to all sacrifices because the Context distinctly points to it as pertaining to the DarçaParṇamāsa only.
prakaraṇādarśaparṇamā sārthatvapratītaiḥ / atha yaduktaṃ liṅgadarśanāditi /	The presence of Indicative Power has been brought forward in support of the Purvapaksha but we have already refuted the force of this conten tion, by showing that the Indicative Power spoken of points to it as per taining to that particular sacrificei.e.

sannikṛṣṭānuvādāsambhave ca vipralaṣṭānuvādo'pyāśrīyate / yathāprāptyapeyohi sa bhavati /	And when the Descriptive Declaration is not found to be connected. with anything in its close proximity, there can be nothing objectionable in its being taken as connected with something at a distance from it specially as the connection of a Descriptive Declaration always depends upon what has, and what has not, been already enjoined.
bahuvacanaṃ cāvivaścitam/	Then as for the Plural in devēbhyaḥ, we cannot attach much significance to it.
atha vā prakṛtivikṛtidevatālocanenopapatsyate /	Or, it might be taken as referring to the deity of the principal sacrifice of the DarçaPūrņamāsa together with those of its various modifications.
tataśvāyamartho bhavati /	. Sutra It is an Injunction, because of its laying down something not laid before.
tadevodāharaṇamupavyayate devalakṣmameva tatkurutaiti tatra vidhiranuvāda iti sandehaḥ /	With regard to the sentence upavyayate dēvalakshmamēva tat kurutē, there arises the question, as to whether this is an Injunction, or a mere Descriptive Declaration.
kathaṃ punaranavadhārite vidhitve sarvārthatvadarśapūrṇamāsārthatvavicāro vṛttaḥ / siddhena vyavahārādidamarthato'dhikaraṇaṃ pūrvaṃ draṣṭavyam / kiṃ prāptamanuvāda iti / kutaḥ	Objection Before you have decided as to whether this sentence is Injunctive or Descriptive, how could you take up the question consi dered in the foregoing Adhikaraṇa, as to whether the Injunction of the Upavita pertained to the DarçaPurnamasa or to all sacrifices? Reply We took the conclusion of the present Adhikaraṇa for granted in the last Adhikaraṇa though in reality this should have been dealt with beforehand. The sentence in question is a mere Descriptive Declaration be cause in the first place, that the man should always wear the sacred thread in the Upavita fashion is distinctly laid down by the Smurtis and as such it is nothing new that could form the subject of Injunc tion by the sentence in question and secondly, the use of the Present Tense in upavyayate would not be compatible with the Injunctive character of the sentence.
nityodakī nityayajñopavītīti hi sarvadā yajñopavītaṃ prāpnaṃ kratāvapyasti /	That is to say, we have such Smrti injunctions as that one should always be nityodaki and nityayajñopa viti, which would refer to the sacrifice also and the actual words of the sentence are not in keeping with the Injunctive character.
na caiṣa vidhisarūpaḥ śabdaḥ tasmādanuvāda iti /	Consequently, the sentence must be taken as a mere Descriptive Decla ration. in the first place, a descriptive declaration referring to all sacrifices would be useless and secondly because the eulogy appearing in connection with the sentence e.g.
na hi namastānuvā vākyasya kiñcitphalamasti nivītaprācīnāvītasaṃkorttanamapi ca vidhoyamānopavītastutyarthatvenaivārthavabhaviṣyati /	That is to say, no useful purpose is found to be served by a Descrip tion of the whole lot of sacrifices and the only useful purpose served by the eulogy contained in the mention of the Upavitu and the Präcīnāvītu would be to glorify the Upavita, which is enjoined in the sentence under consideration.
varttamānāpadeśānāmapi ca tadābhāsatvātprayogavacanārthavādapañcamalakārebhyo vidhiśaktirvyākhyātā /	Then as for the present tense in upavyayutē, it has been ex plained before as having the mere semblauce of the Present Tense, having in reality the force of the Injunctive, based upon its constituting either a sentence laying down the performance of the action as a whole, or as an Arthavñda, or as the Let form of the root.
tasmānnānuvādaḥ	For these reasons, we must conclude that the sentence in question is an Injunction.
udakatvaṃ vā 'pūrvatvāt	It has been argued in the Purcapaksha that the Uparita is found to be already laid down in the Smytis.
tataśca śabdenāncādiśyate ayamapi vidhirapūrvatvāditi / prāptipūrvako anuvādo bhavati /	And the reply to this argument also is contained in the word apūrvatvät that is to say, what is laid down in the Smrti is the Upavita as a property of the Man, while what the son tence in question does is to lay it down as pertaining to the Sacrifice, some thing wholly different from what is laid down in the Smrti.
na cātṛtīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	.
na cāsya stutyarthatā'pi yujyate hiśavdādyaprayogāt / tasmātsidvavaduktānyathānupapatyai vāsyāpi vidhitvamiti ācāraprāptasyodagagratvasya dyotakamātraṃ liṅgadarśana me tanna vidhiḥ /	By taking it thus, we are in keeping with the Context and the Plural number in ‘Dēvēbhyaḥ both of which would be irreconcilable with the DarçaPurnamāsa. Consequently, even though the sentence may have the appearance of a Descriptive Declaration, yet, with a view to make it serve a useful purpose, we must take it as having the Injune tive character, based upon the fact of the sentence being one that lays down the performance of the Action as a whole, etc.,etc. If we take Sutra thus, we must leave off with the mere state of the Purvapaksha and for putting forward the Siddhanta in reply to this we must wait till the latter portion of our explanation of Sutru e.
kutaḥ	P. .
yacchabdayogādākhyātatadviśeṣarahitatvācca sphuṭamihānuvā datvamavadhāritam /	Sūtra d The mention of northwardliness also would be an Injunction, because of its being something new.

Some people quote this sentence as occurring in connection with the Mahāpitṛyajña.
tathaiva ca stutyarthaḥ / purā hyetaduktaṃ na tu sāmprataṃ mṛtāvasthāyāmiti /	The word ca in the Sutra implies that the sentence in question also is an Injunction, because what it lays down is something new. A Descriptive Declaration is always preceded by a previous Injunction. And as regards the case in question we find that the northwardliness of the grass has not been peviously laid down, even as pertaining to the man.
sthitādapyetadevottaram /	i, hi and the like. Sutra The Indicative force of the word is based upon something that already exists.
hiśabdavadākhyātena yataḥ kutacitprāpterapekṣitatvāt / prakaraṇe ca tadabhāvātkimanavagamyamānameva vidhitvaṃ kalpitam uta yatratatrasthā prāptirāśrīyatāmiti /	The sentence cannot be taken as an Injunction because we find it possessed of an Indicative force only pointing to the fact of the grass facing the North, which has been found to have been enjoined by usage. Because, a sentence, that is devoid of the Injunctive affix, is accepted as an Injunction, only when it is found that what it speaks of has never been known by any means. For instance, in the case in question, we find that the sentence in question has the distinct character of a Descriptive Declaration, being, as it is, wholly devoid of such features of the Injunctive as the word yat, and of any verb, either particular or general.
prakaraṇabahuvacanayoścoktam astyeva cānyo'tra vidhiriti nānarthakyam	And this descrip tive character having been once definitely cognized in some way or the other, cannot be superseded.
vidhistu dhāraṇe 'pūrvatvāt sarvamabhyarhitaṃ dravyaṃ pracchādanamapekṣate /	In fact, the northwardliness spoken of in the sentence, we find to have been already previously laid down, in the Smrti sentence Agravanti prāgugrāṇi udagayrāṇi, vā ‘apavargavanti. The word hi in the sentence ‘upavītī hi,etc. distinctly shows that the sentence stands in need of a previous mention of the same fact by means of a verb.
yatra kka cana ca prāpte samittatra niyamyate dhāraṇe vidhireva syāt na hi prāptiḥ kutaścana /	And inasmuch as we do not find any such verb in the Context itself, should we accept its Injunctive character, as pointed out by the absence of such a verb?or should we accept its injunction in any other Context to be the basis of the Descriptive Declaration of the sentence under consideration? And there can be no doubt as to the propriety of accepting the latter alternative,accepting the fact of its having been enjoined in any Context as enough for our purpose, thereby not taking the sentence in question as an Injunction.
samitpracchādanāśaktarnācārāduparisthatā	As for the argument based upon the indications of the Context and the Plural number in ‘ dēvēbhyaḥ, it has already been answered before towards the end of Sutra a, by the Purvapakshin himself.
na cāprāptaṃ hetuvannigaṭena varttamānāpadeśena vā 'nuvadituṃ śakyam / ato'sya vyavadhāraṇakalpanayā 'nuvādasarūpatvaṃ bhakkā vākyaṃ bhittvā vidhitvamāśrīyate /	And further, inasmuch as in the present case we have got another Injunction, the sentence cannot be said to be useless as it wonld serve the purpose of eulogizing the matter of that other Injunction. Sūtra f It is an Injunction, because as regards the Hold ing what it says is something new. Up to this time we have been showing where, in the absence of the Injunctive word, we should take the sentence as a Descriptive Declara tion. And we now proceed to show the exceptions to the rules arrived at in the last few Adhikaranus.
pitrye home 'dhastāt srugdaṇḍasya samidvārayitavyā / daive ca punarupariṣṭāditi /	In connection with the same Mṛtāgnikolra, or with the Makāpitṛyajña, we find the sentence Adhustāt samithandhārayunnanndravēt, upari hi dēvēbhyo dhārayauti in pouring the libations we should hold the stick of fuel underneath the Sruk, as it is in offerings to the gods, that it is held over it.
tasmādvidhiriti	And with regard to the latter part of this i.e.
purā kalpasvarūpeṇa bhajatyarthānuṣaṅgiṇā / digvibhāgasya sambandhānivītātulyatāmatiḥ svābhāvika digādīnāṃ sarvakriyāṅgatvaṃ na nivītavadapūrva vidhātavyam /	With regard to the Holding, the sentence must be taken as an Injunction because it is not found to have been previously enjoined and the stick of fuel being incapable of serving as an efficient protective covering, its being held over the material could not be in keeping with the said usage. That is to say, it is quite true that Usage points out the necessity of giving a protective covering to the valuable material but this would not apply to the case of the stick of fuel, which therefore could not be em ployed on account of its being near at hand, for the purposes of the cover ing as it would be more reasonable to employ the hand for the purpose, than any such thing as the stick of fuel.
tatra manuṣyasaṃbandhe 'pi niyamaphalamājakalpanamevatantravārtika /	Further, the InjunctionSrugdandē samidhamupasāngrhyänudra vatidistinctly points out the place the handle of the Srukwhere the fuelstick is to be held and this would indicate that the stick is held before the material is poured into the Sruk.
na kriyāphalakalpanā/ tadapi ca laukikīnāmeva kriyāṇāmavighna samāpanamapekṣāvaśātkalapyate nānyatsvargādi /	Thus then, we find that the Holding of the stick over the Sruk has not been enjoined by any other senteuce. the Present Tense, or by an Arthavāda bearing the semblance of the state ment of a reason Consequently, by means of a process of construction, we must remove from the sentence the similarity that it bears to a Des criptive Declaration and then, breaking up the sentence, we come to take it as having the Injunctive character and the sense of the sentence thereby comes to be thatIn the case of the Libation offered to Pitrs the fuelstick is to be held underneath the Srukhandle, while in those offered to the gods it is to be held over the handle.
tenaivamābhāti /	Sūtra IThe Specification of the Directions is also like the same. .
yāvatkiṃcinmanuṣyāḥ svārthaṃ karmānutiṣṭhanti tatra pratīcyudīcī cāṅgaṃ bhavati /	And as for the other sentences, they are connected with words which have the genitive ending and which contain within themselves the indication of the actions of the yajamāna consequently, the Results are distinctly cognized as pertaining to the Performer.
yāvacca darbhalavanaṃ tadantarā karttavyaṃ yāvanmīyate tatpūrṇena mātavyam / yāvacca snehakāryaṃ tatsarvaṃ vilīnanavanītena niṣpakkāyuta śabdavācyena karttavyam / naitaraudrayo vi dagdhatvāśritatve kartavye prati /	And even though they be connected with the Performer, yet all that we have to assume is the Result that would follow from the said specification of the Directions, and not any that would follow Action And the result of the specification too that is assumed would be in connection with the ordinary actions of the world and that too only with reference to the unobstructed completion of the work in hand, and nothing in the shape of Heaven,etc. Thus the sense of the sentences comes to be this In the action that the man does for himself, he faces the West or the North, the grass that he cuts is to be cut from the middle, whatever measure is used, it should be full, all the work of oil is to be done with boiled butter, which is known as nishpakvāyuta, while in the action done for the Nairritas and the Rudrus, the material used should be burnt and uncooked respectively.
tenā cāpi pūrvatulyatvaṃ sādhayitavyamityārambhaḥ /	Consequently the method of establishing all this is exactly like what has been employed before.
tatra manuṣyadharmaḥ śabdasya tatpradhānatvāditi vināpi ṣaṣṭhonirdeśādabhajanteti manuṣyasaṃbandhāttādarthyam itareṣu ṣaṣṭhyeva /	What is spoken of belongs to Man, because of the word used signifying him as the principal fuctor Sūtra , that is to say, in the case of the first sentence, even though there is no gepitive ending, yet, inns much as we have the word abhajanta, which makes the whole thing connected with Man, we must take what is mentioned as belonging to him and in all the other sentences under consideration, it is the geni tive ending that points to the fact of the thing in question belonging to So also, what has been said in Sūtra may be said with refer ence to the case under consideration, which would mean the greater ease with which the action would be performed.
tathā 'padeśo veti saukaryātprāptirabhidhīyate pūrvā cipṛṣṭhata ādityaṃ sukhaṃ vyāpriyantaiti praticīprāptiḥ /	That is to say, we get at the West as the direction, because of the fact that during the morn. ing, if one were to turn to the West, he would have the sun at his back, and hence feel more comfortable. Similarly, the cutting of the ŉ grass in the middle, and the measure being full, are laid down because of these being easier for the performer.
kṛtvā tathāntarājavanapūyoraprayatnasādhyatvātprāptiḥ	In the same manner, the idea of the Nairritas being burnt is due to the fact of the burntoffering becom ing black, and as such being more easily connected with Nairrita which means the earth, because of the similarity of colour.
prakaraṇasamākhyābhyāṃ ca karmadharmaḥ / sarvapramāṇānugrahārthaṃ prakaraṇe manuṣyapradhāne niveśaḥ /	But since all these are not distinctly enjoined, therefore, we must take the sentences in question as Restrictive Injunctions. The Content and Name Sūtra however point them out as belonging to Actions and not to Man while all the six means of knowledge jointly point them out as finding a place in that Context wherein Man is the principal factor.
vākyena prakaraṇasamākhyayorvādhātphalakalpanābhayā ccātithyādau niveśaḥ /	But Syntactical Connection Sūtra sets aside the indications of the Context and hence, in order to avoid the assumption of Results, we must take the factors in question as to be employed in such actions As the attending upon guests and the like.
tenāpi saha sambandha pramāṇābhāvātprakaraṇe sambhāvinaścānutkarṣātprācīna vidhiśeṣa tvāccārthavāda iti siddhāntaḥ /	II Then inasmuch as all Prohibitions refer to certain activities, a settlement of the said Doubt depends upon the settlement of the character of the activities and hence the question that calls for settlement before hand is for whose sake is the activity that is prohibited ? The Prohi bition will be taken as pertaining to that for whose sake the activity will be found to be because the prohibition of a thing that belongs to one could not be of any use, with regard to another as no such prohibi tion would be called for specially as in all cases, we find that whenever a man is found to be acting towards a certain end, it is with regard to the same end that he is found to be prohibited.
samyak śrutayathāvidita viṣayānyaviṣayastutivivekasiddhiḥ	And so long as we have not come to a defi nite conclusion with regard to Verbs, the case of Prohibition should rest aside.
tasmātpravṛttikaimarthyacintā pravṛttīnāmapyabhidhāyakākhyāsavaśenaidamathyaṃ nirūpyata ityākhyāta śabdāścintayitavyāḥ	Thus then, the question to be dealt with comes to be this Those Injunctions that we find in a Context, which are not connected with any other words denoting a relationship with Manfor whose anke are the Bhavanas that these Injunctions express? And in connection with this phase of the question, we shall have for examples, all such sentences, as Samidho yajati, · Tanūnapātan yajati,etc. With regard to these we will have the same question as to whether the SamitSacrifice is for the sake of the Sacrifice, or for that of Man and so forth.
kimākhyātena karttā 'bhidhīyate neti/ tatra yadyabhidhīyate tataḥ śrītatvātprayojanākāhiṇī bhāvanā prakaraṇagamyakratvarthatvabādhanena puruṣārthā bhavati /	And similarly with regard to the sentence anṛtam vadēt, the question comes to be whether the prohibited Telling of lies is for the sake of Sacrifice, or for that of Man because the qualification of Lie would belong to that for whose sake there would be the telling. Then, inasmuch as at the time of Prohibition, the Injunctiveness is transferred to that Prohibition, the consideration of all other words should be made subservient to that one purpose. Thus then, in the case of the Prohibition pertaining to Man, it would mean that one should not do that telling of lies which is for the sake of Man while in the other case, it would mean that one should not do the telling of those lies that are for the sake of sacrifices.
atha nābhidhīyate tataḥ śrutivirodhābhāvātprakaraṇena kratvarthatā / nanu satyapi kartturabhidhāne bhāvanāpradhānatvādākhyātena to pratyupādīyamānasya śrautopi sambandhaḥ prakaraṇānuguṇatvādaviruddho naiva kratvarthatāṃ bādhate virodhinau hi tulyakakṣā sambandhī pararasparaṃ bādheyātāṃ na guṇapradhānabhūtau /	IV Then, inasmuch as a settlement of all the above issues de pends upon the due ascertainment of the nature of Verbs, the question with which we immediately concern ourselves comes to be this Does the Verbal Affix denote the Nominative Agent or not? If it does denoto it, then, when the Bhāvanā expressed would come to look for its purpose, the fact of the Agent being directly spoken of by the word would set aside the idea of the action being for the sake of the Sacrificethis latter idea being based solely upon the Context and we would accordingly be led to conclude that the Bhavana in question is for the sake of the Nominative Agent Man while if the verb does not denote the Agent, then, inasmuch as the indications of the Context would not be contra dicted by any Direct Declaration to the contrary, the Bhāvanā would he concluded to be for the sake of the Sacrifice, as indicated by the Context. Objection As a matter of fact, we find that even if the Verk. denoted the nominative agent, inasmuch as the Bhavand would always remain the principal factor, even though the relationship of the agent, that would be denoted by the Verb with reference to that Bhāvanā, would be one that is directly declared, yet that could very well be taken as subservient to the Context and as such, there would be no in compatibility of this relationship with the fact of the Prohibition per. taining to the Sacrifice.
tadyathā daśāpavitreṇa grahaṃ sammātyatra daśāpavitropasarjanasya saṃmārgasya grahaṃ pratyupādīyamānasya naivamāśaṅkā bhavati /	As for instance, in the case of the sentence Daçapavitrena graham sammärshṭi we find that with regard to the summärga, which, as subservient to the Daçapavitra, is mentioned in connection with the Graha, there does not arise any question as to whether it is related to “the Daçõpavitra or the Graha exactly in the same manner, in the case in question, if the action Telling of Lies, which has the Agent sub servient to it, be taken as pertaining to the Sucrifice, there can be no thing objectionable in this.
yadi tvākhyātena kartuḥ prādhānyamucceta tataḥ prakaraṇagamyena kratuprādhānyena virodhaḥ syāt /	If the Verbal Affie denoted the fact of the Agent being the predomi nant factor, then alone would that have gone against the indications of the Context as to the predominance of the Sacrifice. Or, if the Verbal Affix denoted the fact of the Sacrifice being the subservient factor, as the Agent is, then we would have had the incongruity of having two auxiliaries the Agent and the Sacrifice coalescing in the same Pri mary the action of Telling of Lies.
yadi vā karturitra kratorapi guṇatvaṃ syāt /	the verb does not denote either the predomi nance of the Agent, or the subservience of the Sacrifice.
tata ubhayoḥ śeṣayoḥ śeṣisamavāyavirodho lakṣyate na tu tadubhayamapyasti /	Consequent ly, the Direct Declaration pointing to the predominance of the Agent, and the Uontext indicating the predominance of the Sacrifice, the two are found to pertain to two distinct subjects and thus, there being no coalition of the two with regard to any one subject, there can be no conflict between them and in the absence of conflict, the one cannot reject the other .
ataḥ śrutyā karturguṇabhāvātprakaraṇena ca kratoḥ prādhānyānnānāviṣayatvenāsamavāyādavirodhaḥ tadbhāvādabādhaḥ syāditi/	Or again, it has been shown to be a general rule, that in the case of all words, the basic root and the affix conjointly denote the meaning of the Affix, by reason of the order in which they appear and in accordance with this rule, in the case of the Verb also, both the Root and the Affix would denote the Agent as the predominant factor, to which the denotation of the basic root would be subservient,just as in the case of the krdanta word the word formed by the root and the krt affix.
naitadevam	Specially as to the general rule just shown, we have never found an exception, either it.
yadvaitadaviśeṣeṇa sthitaṃ kramavaśādubhau /	the shape of an argument, or a rule to the contrary. And thus, just as in the case of Roots with nominal and krt affixes, so in the case of the ordinary verbs also, it is the denotation of the Affix that comes to be the predominant factor.
pratyayārthaṃ sa brataḥ prakṛtipratyayāviti	the Root is actually cognised as the predominant factor, while the Agent is recognised as the subservient factor as, if this latter also were the predominant factor, there would be no connection between the two.
na hyasautsargikasya nyāyasya smaraṇasya vāpavādabhūtaṃ nyāyāntaraṃ smaraṇāntaraṃ copalabhyate /	That is to say, in all cases, we have seen that there can be no connection between two factors that are either both subservicut, or both predomin ant.
tena kuttadvitāntavadeva pratyayā rthaprādhānyaṃ prāpnoti /	Consequently, when it becomes necessary to take one of them as the subservient, and the other as the predominant factor, then such discrimination could only be made in accordance with our actual cogni tions.
tataśca śabdenaiva dhātvarthasya śeṣatvamuktaṃ nātikramituṃ śakyate / nanu sāmānyamutsṛṣṭaṃ pratītiviśeṣeṇāpodyeta /	And thus there can be no chance for the Agent to be recognised as the predominant factor To the above we make the following reply The denotation of the Root can never be the predominant factor and thus the aforesaid general rule would not be set aside in our case as we hold the Bhāvanā to be the denotation of the Verbal affix. That is to say, it has been already shown that, inasmuch as the predominant factor in the denotation of the Verb consists of the Bhavana which is denoted by the Affix, no pre.
tathāhi	.
iyostāvatpradhānayorguṇayorvā sarvacaiva sambandho nāvakalpate / tatrāvaśyaṃ kalpanīye guṇapradhānatve yathāpratīti vyavasthā sampravārtike /	dominance of that Bhavana specially as from the very definition of the denotation of the Affix that you vouchsafe, it is the Agent that comes to be the predominant factor and that as you have also shown is opposed to the facts of actual cognition. Consequently, if the trend of actual cognition is to be followed, then it must be in due accordance with that that the denotation of the Affix should be defined and there is no doubt that such a definition has been supplied only by those who hold that denotation to consist of the Bhāvanā, and by none others.
'vadhāryate /	Says the Opponent What you say would be possible in case the Direct Declaration referred only to the relationship of Tadurthyu belonging to, being for the sake of.
tatpratītiśca yathā'nyatra prakutyarthe/pasarjana pratyayā rthaviṣayatvenopalabhyate tathā 'tra pratyayārthopasarjanaprakṛtyartha viṣayā sarvasya svasaṃvedyā /	As a matter of fact however, what is actually declared, and cognised as such, is the relationship between the denotations of the Root and the Affix, of the qualification and the quali fied, without any vestige of Tädarthya, auything with regard to the one belonging to, or being for the sake of, the other. And though the denota tion of the Root, which is the qualification, is cognised as the subser vient factor, yet, as in the case of the word Rajapurushaḥ, so in the present case also, the characters of the Subsidiary and Primary may be attributed in a way contrary to that indicated by actual cognition.
na ca tato'nyat balavatkārāmasti /	Then again, in the case of such words Pacaku and the like, the karuku is not one that has the point of its predominant factor doubtful and yet, even in such cases, the Action is not cognised as belonging to the Agent.
tasmādaprasaṅgaḥ karttuḥ pradhānatvasyeti dhātvarthasya pradhānatvaṃ na tāvadiha janmani / śrautsargiko na ca nyāyo matpate hi nivasrtsyati	That is to say, thongh the Agent may be denoted as the predominant factor, yet the Import does not show it to be the principal factor. Consequently, if the Verb were to indicate the character of the Agent, it could not be indicated as the subordinate factor and if one is called an Agent, a performer, while performing an action, then, inasmuch as one who performs an action must be a factor subordinate to that Action, he could never be recognised as the Primary or Principal factor.
sya viśeṣaṇatayā rājā puruṣasyopasarjanam /	The same may be said to be the case where the actual denotation is wholly indifferent as to the predominance or subservience of the Agent.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	ijyatë instead of ‘yajati, in accordance with Pāņinis sūtra Bhāvakarmaṇoryak.
arthayoḥ śeṣaśeṣitve tasyaiveṣṭā pradhānatā	That is to say, the definition of Nominative Agent that we should admit must be one that applies to all such Agents. such objects. Consequently, this latter alone should be accepted as constituting the differentia of the Agent.
tathāpi tu na mādathyeṃ kriyāṇāmavadhāryate	Thus then we find that the Action cannot belong to the Man or Agent even in the case of its being denoted by the Verbal Affix.
prādhānyeneha karttṛtvaṃ yadi nāmābhidhīyate / tatastātparyato vācyaṃ guṇatvamavadhāritam	To the above, we make the following reply Though it is quite true that the verb does not denote the subsidiary character of the Action when it is taken as denoting the Agent, yet such character of it is shown by the very fact of its qualifying the Agent, and thereby being subordinate to it. Consequently, one kind of its subservience to the Agent, with regard tits denotation by the verb along with the Action, is found to be dis tinctly mentioned.
kartṛtvaṃ sādhakatvena siddhaṃ taccābhidhīyate /	And that should be accepted, with regard to the Per formance also of the action and not with regard to the denotation only.
acetanepi kāṣṭhādā kartṛtvamabhidhīyate /	the Purusha is recognised as subordinate to the Raja as has been shown under the Saktvadhikaraṇa IIi et seq.
na ca tatra phalohe śastasmānnaiṣā 'vadhāraṇā	and it has also been explained that this latter recognition of the contrary relationship does not necessarily make such relation the actual denotation of the words.
bibhrāṇaḥ puruṣaṃ rājā guṇatvaṃ tāvadṛcchati / svāmitvaṃ bhajate paścādvivakṣā ta yathārūci	S In fact, that subordinate element which really subsists in the Rājā, is that upon which the operation of the word in Rajapurushaḥ is based. That subordinate element really exists. Because the Rāja, pro viding for the subsistence of the Purusha his servant, comes to be endowed with the subordinate character and as for his lordship over the man, he comes to assert it later on and the way in which he may be spoken of either as the Lord or the subordinate depends upon the wish of the speaker in whichever character he may wish to represent him.
prayogaiyasya vidyamānasya tāvaḍyavasthā hitāvarthadaye sambhavati kimiti vakṣyamāpakriyopayogāpecayā vivakṣābhedamātreṇa kliṣṭāṃ vyavasthāmāśrayiṣyāmahe / tena bhūtaṃ nimittamālocca śabde prayujyamāne rājapuruṣa ityatropakārāṃśakṛtaṃ śeṣatvameva vivaścitamiti gamyate /	Thus then, while the use of the two forms Rajapurushaḥ and Purusharājāḥ is found to be conditioned by the two meanings shown above as those desired to be conveyed, why should we have recourse to the complicated alternative of having the use of them conditioned by the mere desire to express, as based upon the help accorded to the action to be spoken of afterwards ? Thus then, when the use of a word is found to be brought about by a previ ously existing cause, we conclude that in the case of the word Rajapuru shah, the subsidiary character of the Rija that is meant is that basel upon the fact of his helping the servant. Though, in the case of such possessions as the Cow, the born slave and the like, the subsidiary character of the Master is absolutely nonexisting, yet such character should be taken as imposed upon him by the possibility of his extending his helping hand to them. It may be argued that in such cases as that of the word Rajapuru shuḥ, with a view to establish the superiority of the Rajā, we can explain npasarjana the character whereof is attributed to the Raja as Helper, and not as Subsidiary.
yatrā'pi yogarbhadāsādisvāminyatyantā vidyamānameva śeṣatvaṃ tatrāpyupakārakatvasambhavādupacaritamiti draṣṭavyam tirohitaṃ ca karmatvaṃ na gṛhṇīyādapi kriyām /	In the case of all such words as pacaka and the like, inasmuch as the very existence of the word is due to the action of helping by cooking, etc., we accept the existence of this helping in the actions of cooking, f.i.. which thus become endowed with the character of the Subsidiary, and not with that of the Primary, which could be based only on the fact of their being something to be accomplished. Objection In that case, in the sentence prokshitābhyām ulūkhalı musalābhyām,etc. by means of the ulūkhala and musala duly washed, etc., the washing would become subservient to the substance pounded.
āvirbhūtaṃ tu kartṛtvamākhyātasthaṃ grīṣyati	Reply Who denies that fact? We quito readily admit it.
kārakopasarjanībhūtasya dravyasya pratyāsattimātreṇa saṃkhyādayaḥ śeṣāḥ sambhaveyuste tvatyanta pratyāsanna pradhānabhūtena kārake pāpahṛtya kriyāyai nīyante / na tvevaṃ dhātvarthānāṃ kena cihnanavattaraṇa pramāṇena kratvarthatvamavagamyate yena kartṛtvaśeṣatā bādhyeta	detail of washing teuds towards the accomplishment of the intervening action of threshing and pounding, etc., or to that of the much remoter Apurva of the Sacrifice. And as for the consideration of the question as to for whose sake we have the washing, that could not be very well carried on, without a reference to the Ulakhala and the Musalu,the question to be considered being whether the washing is for the sake of the capability of the Ulakhala and the Musala to bring about the actions of threshing and pounding, or to that capability of these which tends to bring about a certain transcendental result Apūrva. Then again, though the hidden objective character of a certain thing would not include the action, yet, when the Nominative character becomes manifested, as located in manifested by the Verb, this latter would certainly include it. That is to say, those karakas the Accu sative,etc. that are denoted by krdantas nouns formed by krt affixes, obeing hidden not explicit, could not take up the action as being for their own sake those, however, that reside in Nouns and Verbs proper, are quite manifest, and would be capable of taking up the action.
kartṛṇāṃ śāstragamye 'rthe cetanānāmadhikriyā /	To this we make the following reply Inasmuch as the singleness, etc., are included in the Karakas, they would be for the sake of the Action, because of their being amenable to the direct denotation of the Karakas and this would set aside the idea of those singleness,etc. being subsidiary to the substance.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	is the predominant factor, being more proximately related to the number inasmuch as the käraka and the number aro denoted by the same case ending, while the number and the substance are denoted by two distinct parts of the Verb.
vidhiśva na bhavetteṣāṃ phalasaṅkalpanāhate	Scriptures, it is only intelligent agents that are entitled consequently, there could be no injunction of actions for such agents, unless it were accompanied by a distinct definition of the Result to follow from the performance of those actions.
tenāvaśyamanuṣṭhātṛtvanīcamānaḥ puruṣaḥ kimapi mamaiṣā kriyā sākṣātparamparyeṇa vopakariṣyatotyadhyavasyati sājhādupakārake ca sambhavati na pāramparyopakāra kalpanā labhyate /	Consequently, when the Man comes to be spoken of as the performer of a certain action, he at once comes to the conclusion that the action is calculated to accomplish, either directly or indirectly, something desirable for himself and so long as it is possible to have the help accorded directly, it is not right to assume an indirect help.
na ca saṃskārānaīḥ karttā kratuphalādhāratvena saprayojanatvāt /	Nor is the performer wholly incapable of undergoing preparatory purifications, because, being meant to be the substratum of the result of the Sacrifice, his purification would serve a distinctly useful purpose.
kastasyopakāra iti cet sarvathā tāvatmāmānyenopakāramātramavadhāritam / tāvatā ca kratvarthatvaṃ vyāvarttitaṃ tadviśeṣāvadhāraṇaṃ ca yatheṣṭaṃ kalpayiṣyate /	As for the particular help that could be accorded to him by the action. we can, at the first instance, take it to be a mere help in general as this would be enough to set aside the idea of the action being for the sake of the Sacrifice and when this has been done, then we can go ou assuming, as we wish, the particular helps accorded to the performer by the action in question but this seeking after particular helps would be of no use in the present connection, as the mere fact of the action according sume help to the Performer would be enough to show that the action cannot be for the sake of the Sacrifice.
yadyapi ca prādhānyāṃśa kartṛtvavacanenānabhihitastatra cānantargatastathāpi tadanyathānupapatyaiva pratyāyitatvātmambadhyate / yathā svargakāmādiśabdena puruṣaviśeṣavacanenānuktamapi svargasya sādhyatvaṃ kalpayiṣyate /	That is to say, in case the Verb be accepted to be denotative of the Performer, the Nominative Agent. Even though the mere denotation of the Nominative Agent would. not express his predominance, which is not included in the former denotation, yet, the apparent inconsistency of the former denotatiou would necessarily imply the fact of the predominance also being signified by the same Verb. As for instance, even though the word scargakā muh, which denotes a particular Person, does not denote the fact of the scarga being the object to be attained, yet this latter is assumed on the strength of the apparent inconsistency of the previous denotation as we shall show in Adhyāya VI.
tathā svāmitvamapi buddhipūrvakāriṇaḥ puruṣasya phalalipsayaiva ka tṛtvapratītyā pratipatsyate/	nition of the nominative character being based upon the presence, in that person, of a desire for the acquiring of the results to proceed from that action.
tatra yathaiva devatāyāḥ karmaṇābhipreyamāṇāyāḥ prādhānyaṃ yāgasādhanatvapratipattyarthameva jñāyate na prā dhānyasvarūpaparyavasāyitvena tatheha guṇatvaṃ prādhānya siddhyarthameva draṣṭavyam	And then again, in the case of the Deity, which is the reci pient of the offering made in the action, we find that its predominance is recognized only as leading to its being cognised as instrumental in the com pletion of the Sacrifice, and not with the sole end of merely establishing the said predominance and similarly in the case in question, the sub sidiary character of the Agent should be taken only as calculated to estab lish his predominance consisting in the fact of his being the possessor of the result following from the action. Then again, the subsidiary character of the Nominative Agent is not recognized as referring to the significations of the verbal roots, but as with reference to the Bhāvanā and when the Agent comes to be known as subsidiary to the Bhāvanā, do not you even then admit the significa tion of the verbal root to be subsidiary to him? That is to say, even for one who holds the Nominative Agent to be denoted by the Verbal Affix i.e.
yasthā'pi karttā pratyayārthastenāpyavabhyaṃ pratītivaśādbhāva santravārtike /	And then, inasmuch as it is the Bhavana that is denoted by the same Verbal Affix, and is the predominant factor in the denotation of that affix, it naturally takes with itself the Nominative Agent as its subsidiary and as such, the Agent does not become subsidiary to the signification of the verbal root.
nābhyupagantavyā/	And certainly we cannot attach any importance to that which is not mentioned by the Scriptures.
tatasyaikapratyayopādānātprādhānyācca saiva ka tarimaṅgīkarotīti na dhātvarthāṅgatā bhavatīti / sa tu bhāvanāyāṃ vyāpṛtastāmanyathā kartumaśaknuvan dhātvartha mevāṅgīkaroti/	Consequently, if we could find ont some scriptural authority pointing to the fact of the Agent being indi cated by the Bhāvanã, then alone could we accept it as being in keeping with the Scriptures, and hence admissible. But as a matter of fact, we find that all the words of the Scripture betake themselves to the indirect method of Indication only when their direct signification is not found to be of any use with regard to the Action and in the case in question we find that the Bhāvanā is of use in the Action, only in the shape in which it is directly denoted by the verbal affix.
na cobhayātmakatvaṃ vipratiṣiddhaṃ viṣayānyatvādeva /	But it is not possible for the verbal affix to operate, at the same time, both directly with regard to the Bhāvanā and indirectly with reference to the Agent.
yadi dhātvarthameva prati guṇatvameva kalapyeta tataḥ sakkadupāḍhāne vipratiṣiddhamiva syāt /	Then, as for the mere cogni tion of the Agent by Indication, that would be possible only when the Agent would be a subordinate factor, and honce the said Indication could not point to the fact of the Agent being the predominant factor.
iha tu bhāvanā prati guṇatvaṃ dhātvartheṣu prādhānyamityavirodhaḥ /	And then the upshot of the whole affair is that, for the sake of its own accomplishment, which would not be otherwise possible, the Bhāvanā implies the Agent, only as a subordinate, and not as a predominant factor and hence an idea of his predominance would be wholly un founded.
svabhāvaścobhayātmakaṃ vastu yadi tathaiva śabda upādatte kiṃ tatra vipratiṣidma/ atha vaikaṃ śabdādekaṃ sāmarthyādityavirodhaḥ /	Specially as the Bh ävand would not be able to imply the Agent, if he were the predominant factor. Consequently as soon as the Agent begins to bring itself forward to a predominant position, and we look for an authority for this latter position, we find both the word the verbal affix and the Bhavana wholly indifferent on the point and as a matter of fact, there can be no other right means of the cognition of the said predominance which thus becomes wholly unfounded. Thus then, we find that the consideration of the question, as to whether, or not, the Agent is denoted by the vorbal affix, has a very important bearing upon the main point of the Adhikaraņa.
sarvathā 'sti tāvatkarttuḥ prādhānyaprasaktiriti puruṣārtho dhātvarthaḥ prāpnoti /	Because the word vadet directly denotes the Man as the no. minative agent because it is only when taken in this manner that the Injunction is found to serve a useful purpose and because if it pertained to the sacrifice, it would be altogether useless.
śabdārtha vastvarthātmanobhayaprakāra syopasarjanatvasyāyaṃ vivekaḥ / pācakaṃ rājapuruṣaṃ cānayetyatra puruṣasthānayanasambandhinaḥ pācako rājā vā śabdārthamātratayopasarjanatvaṃ pratipanna iti śeṣatvaṃ yāvanna gacchedapi vaḍhedityevamādiṣa tu kartuḥ kāryānsarasambandhānupādānānna śabdārthopasarjanatvamākāśita miti pariśeṣādvastvarthopasarjanatvameva śeṣatvamavadhāryate /	That is to say, in the first place, the connection of the action of telling with the Agent is directly denoted by the fact of both of them being denoted by the same word the telling by the root vada, and the Agent by the verbal affix, in the word vadēt and this connection sets aside the indication of the Context which is the sole authority for connecting the Telling with the Sacrifice. Secondly, the operation of the Injunctive in vadet also is found to serve the distinctly useful purpose of laying down something not mentioned before i.e. the prohibition of the telling of lies for the sake of Man while if it were meant to be for the sake of the Sacrifice, then, the Injunctiveness would rest wholly in that which is signified by the root i.e.the mere telling, which would be brought up by the declaration of the per formance of the sacrifice as a whole and as such an actual injunction to the same effect would be absolutely useless. This is what is meant hy the Bhashya,Otherwise, the meaning of the word vadet comes to be merely that telling is and the use of the word vadēt, which denotes the nominative as well as the Injunction, for expressing the mere fact™ that telling is, would be absolutely useless.
tasmādastyabhidhānapace dhātvarthānāṃ puruṣārthatve pramāṇamiti /	Thus then, inasmuch as all Injunctions are for the sake of Man. formance of the DarçaPurnamas,the same declaration made for the sake of Man, in connection with this sacrifice, must be taken as merely descriptive of that which has permanent existence for the Man, ever since his Upanayana.

AnswerWhat is meant to be set aside by the Sūtra is that which the Siddhanti takes to be connected with the sacrifice, which is spoken of as connected with it, and which is indicated, by the Context, as being thus connected the meaning of the Sûtra would thus be this That which is meant by the Siddhanti to be related to the sacrifice, or that which is spoken of as related to it, or that which is indicated by the Con text to be related to it,inasmuch as all this would really pertain to the Man, the sentence in question must be taken as merely descriptive of what talready exists.
naiṣa doṣaḥ sa śabdo khacaṇā yāti yaḥ śrutyā nopayujyate /	As a Objection The sentence in question, which is a Cruti, must be taken as the basis for the Smrtitext that prohibits the telling of lies at the Upanayana.
śrutyarthenopayukte tu lakṣaṇā nāntarīyakī vaḍhediti śrutera puruṣaḥ sampratīyate /	That is to say, it has already been shown in the Smrti pada that all Smrtis are authoritative only by reason of their being based upon corroborative Cruti texts and consequently, inasmuch as the sentence in question is found to be expressive of the same thing as the Smrti text prohibiting the telling of lies found in connection with the Upanayana ceremony, the former should be taken as the basis of the latter and not as merely descriptive of it.
vidhirapyarthavānevaṃ kratvarthe 'narthako bhavet siddhānte kratusaṃyuktaṃ samāmnāyena vocyate /	That is to say, if the authority of the Smrti rested in itself, independently of everything else, then, on the strength of this fact, the Crutisentence under con sideration might have been taken as merely descriptive of what has always existed on the strength of the aforesaid Smrtitext.
sarvātāvamatirnityaṃ śrutimūlapramāṇikā /	matter of fact, however, in the case of all Smrti texts, it is necessary to trace the corroboration of a Grutitext.
tena smṛtyarthavācitvānnānuvādo bhavedasau	And in the case in question, the only alternatives at our disposal are to assume some other Crutitext as the basis of the said Smrti, and take the one under consi deration as merely descriptive, or to take the sentence under consi deration as the basis of that Smrti.
yadi prakaraṇaṃ tyatkā puruṣārtheya miṣyate /	Because if the sentence in question were taken as pertaining to Man, being taken apart from the Context, then in that case, inasmuch as the sentence would have the same meaning as the Smrti rule.why should not.
tataḥ smṛtisamānārthā naṣṭā mūlaṃ kathaṃ śrutiḥ	When, however, the indications of the Context are set aside, and the sentence under consideration is taken as pertaining to Man, then, inasmuch as this also would come to pertain to the time of the Upanayana and thus being exactly similar in charac ter to the Smrti rule, wherefore should not the Purvapakshi have admitted the fact of the Smrti being based upon the sentence in ques tion? Why too would it be necessary for the Smrti rule to have mentioned the DurçaPūrṇamāsa when both the Smrti and its corrobo rative Crutitext in the shape of the one under consideration would come to pertain to Man? For these reasons, we conclude that the denial in the Bhishya passage under consideration of the fact of the sentence in question being the basis of the Smrti rule was illadvised.
pūrvapakṣāstrayo hyatra bhāṣyakārasya saṃmatāḥ / pūrvasminmūlamalitvaṃ parayostvanuvādatā	But this objection is not quite admissible because in the present Adhikarana, the Bhishya puts forth three distinct Purvapakshas from among whom, the first can admit of the fact of the sentence under consideration being the basis of the Smrti rule, while the other two insist upon the former being taken merely as descriptive of what has been laid down in the latter.
puruṣaṃ hi parityajya nānṛtaṃ prāpyate ṛtau /	That is to say, if the only declaration of the Pärvapaksha were that in regard to the sentence pertaining to Man, then the Bhashya passage under consideration would have been irrelevant.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	And the objector, taking his stand upon the first Purvapaksha, objects to the declaration of the sentence in question being merely descriptive, when it should be taken as forming the very basis of the Smrti rule.
puruṣe tanniṣiddhaṃ cenniṣiddhaṃ tanāvapi	This view would be in keeping with Direct Declaration which connects the telling with the Man as well as with the Context which connects it with the Sacrifice.
vidhirvā saṃyogāntarāt	Sutra It is an Injunction because of the connection being wholly different.
kevala puruṣārthatvapace tāvadbhāṣyakāra saṃyogāntaraṃ varṇayati /	First of all, the Bhashya takes the argument herein propounded, viz., the difference of connectionas against the first Purvapaksha, that the Prohibition relates to the Man by himself.
smṛtau hi satyaṃ brūyāditi dharmāya satyaniyamaḥ śrūyate nānṛtaṃ vadediti tvanṛtapratiṣedho bhinnau caitāvarthai na cānyat śrayamāṇamanya māṇasyānuvādo bhavati /	In the Smrti, we find the rule One should tell the truth Satyam brüyāt,enjoining the telling of truth as a source of Dharma Virtue while the sentence in question nânṛtam vadēt lays down the Prohibition of telling lies and thus there is a distinct difference between the subjectmatter of the two rules. And as a matter of fact we know that the mention of one thing cannot be descriptive of that of a totally different thing consequently the sentence in question must be taken as un independent Injunction. Objection There are only two ways in which a man can speak, the telling of the truth, and the telling of untruth consequently the restriction of telling the truth would naturally involve the prohi bition of the telling of the untruth and thus the latter would certainly be descriptive of the former.
tasmādvidhiḥ /	Reply It is not so because of the difference of connection.
nanu iyyeva puruṣasya vākyapravṛttiḥ satyavacanamanṛtavadanaṃ ca tatra yadā satyaṃ tanniyataṃ tadārthādevānṛtaṃ pratiṣiddhaṃ bhavatītyanuvādatvaṃ prāpnotyeva /	For instance, whenever the Injunction operates, it operates towards the fulfilment of something desirable, while the Prohibition operates in a wholly different manner, serving the purpose of setting aside from a sin. That is to say, in the case of the Injunction one should tell the truth we find that when the resultant Bhavanā stands in need of a purpose, this latter is found to consist in the form of Heaven, etc., because of the fact of all Injunctions relating to something desirable to Man thus then, the meaning of the Injunction comes to be that, it being possible for man to tell the truth as well as the untruth, if he sticks to the telling of the truth, he comes to be endowed with some thing desirable and hence one who would tell the truth would attain to Heaven.
naitadevam / kutaḥ /	But the Injunction says nothing as to whether the telling of untruth constitutes an excellence or a defect.

Consequently, the sentence in question must be taken as an Injunction.
asti ca vidhipratiṣedhayoḥ phalabhedādarthabhedaḥ /	Objection This very reason would show that while the former has a universal application, the latter is very limited in its scope, and as such this latter could certainly be taken as merely descrip tive of the former. Reply It is not so because there is a difference in their results, as just shown above.
katham prajāpativratasthatvāttatrānī kṣaṇayuktitaḥ / paryudāsena satyasya vidhirityavagamyate smārttaḥ puruṣamātrasya saṃyogaḥ svārthasiddhaye /	For instance, all that the Prohibition contained in the Smrti shows that, with a view to remove sinfulness from himself, the Man should not tell a lie. And hence if a person per forming the DärçaPurnamasa sacrifice should come to infringe this prohibition, he would, by that, be infringing something that is wholly apart from the Sacrifice and hence all that such an infringe ment would do would be to bring upon him a sin and it could not canse any discrepancy in the sacrifice itself if we did not attach any distinct significance to the Prohibition that we have found laid down in connection with the Sacrifice.
ayaṃ tu ṛtusaṃyuktapuruṣārthaḥ phalāntare	For these reasons, the sense of the Smrti rule would come to be this One who would tell a lie in course of the DarçaPurņamāsa would go to hell, but he would obtain the results of the Sacrifice all the same.
kratavo hi svasambandhinā vidhipratiṣedhāvapekṣamāṇāstadatikrame sati viguṇā bhavanti ye puruṣagatā vidhipratiṣedhārate katvantaragatā ivāsya sadasadbhāvayoraviśiṣṭāḥ / na hi teṣu guṇabuddhimatpanā yenātikame baiguṇyabuddhiḥ syāt /	To both of these we offer the following reply We do not admit any Conjugational Affix to be expressive of the Nominative agent and as for the idea of the Nominative that is found to follow from the Conjugational Affixes, that must be attributed to a different relationship Samyogāntarāt. That is to say, in all cases, when the utterance of a word is found to give rise to the cognitions of a number of things, this does not make all these things denotable by that word because the assump tion of the denotative potency of the word with regard to an object depends upon the apparent inconsistency of the concomitance between them the word and the idea of the object and only that object is known as denotable by a word, with regard to which the denotative potency of that word has been duly assumed. And such assumption of the denotative potency that is not perceptible, is allowable only in those cases where, without such assumption, we could not explain a certain use of the word and the cognition actually brought about by it e.g.
tena darśapaurṇamāsayoranṛtaṃ vadan narakaṃ ca prāpnuyāt darśapūrṇamā saphala cāvikalamevāpnuyāt / iti ca smṛtyarthaḥ śrataḥ punaḥ prakaraṇayuktapuruṣadharma ityatraiṣo'rtho vijñāyate /	we assume such a potency of the words denotative of classes with regard to Individuals, and that of such words as Lion and the like with regard to the Boyetc. i.e. in the cases of recognised Indica tive signification. Now then, in the case of such verbs as Pacati and the like, we find them giving rise to ideas of the following things the Bhāvanī, the Rootmeaning, the Nominative Agent, the number of this Agent, the fact of the personal results accruing to the Agent in the case of the Atmanepada, a particular point of time.
varjitānutavacana kena puruṣeṇa kṛtau darśapai/rṇamāsau phalaṃ sādhayata iti /	cated by Time and the other factors signified by the word.
prakaraṇasāmarthyāddhi puruṣagatamapūrvasāghanatvaṃ lakṣayitvā 'nṛtaṃ pratiṣidmatastadatikrame darśapūrṇamāsāpūrvameva vaiguṇyānna syāt/	Nor can it be urged that the Bhavand would be implied by the Nominative Agent and the Rootmeaning both of which are among the factors signified by the verb, because in that case, the Bhavana would not be the predominant factor, exactly as in the case of nouns formed with kert affixes. That is to say, if the Bhāvanā were implied either by the Nominative or by the Root meaning, then it could be cognised only in a subdued form, just as it is in the case of such words as pacuka and the like.
na tu purupasyaiva kaścitpratyavāyaḥ /	Tallness is not accepted to be denotative of the Man.
na hi tadānīṃ pratyavāyaḥ kalpyamānaḥ svatantrapuruṣasambandhitvena kalpayituṃ śakyate /	But in such cases, the reason for nonconcomitance does not lie in the fact of being related to another, but in that of the one being found to have an existence even without the other. In a case, however, where the thing in question, even when existing elsewhere, does not totally abandon its former relative, we cannot take them to be nonconcomi tant e.g.
tasmādasti saṃyogāntaramiti vidhiḥ/	Consequently it must be admitted as an indubitable fact, that the Bhavana indicates all the Karakas.
evaṃ śukratudharmapace 'pi ṛtapuruṣapratyavāya viśeṣātsaṃyogāntaraṃ vyākhyeyam / tena nityānuvādastā vanna bhavati / yastu ṛtudharmatvatadgata puruṣadharmatvayorviśeṣastamupariṣṭādacyāmaḥ /	Thus then, in the case in question in the verb vadēt we find that the singleness which is found to be expressed by the Singular Affix, whether it be the qualification or the qualified, is not found to be indicated by any other means and as such this cannot but be regarded as denoted by the word. If the Nominative were capable of indicating the said Singleness, then in accordance with the law relating to the class by which the class is taken to be directly denoted by the word, and, in its turn, to indicate the Individual, the Nominative would be taken as directly denoted, while the singleness would be taken as indicated by it. As a matter of fact, however, we find that the cognition of the Nominative is invariably concomitant with that of Singleness and hence the former cannot be accepted as capable of indicating the latter conse quently we must admit the Singleness also to be directly denoted by the word.
ubhayathā'pi vidhisiddheridānoṃ nopayujyataiti nocyate /	And the denotative potency of the word being thus trans ferred to the singleness, the Nominative comes to be the object of Indica tion and as such, even though recognised as the qualification of single ness, it cannot be accepted as being denoted by the word.
gṛhṇīma eta dedhiriti pūrvotantravārtike / ktenaiva kāraṇena puruṣadharma iti vadāmaḥ sarvākhyāteṣu kartṛṇāmiṣṭā naivābhidheyatā /	When it is ´ the singleness that is recognised as the qualification, then too it is this that should be the first to be denoted by the word and when this has been denoted, the denotative potency having been spent up in this, it looks out for the indication of the qualified Nominative by some other means and as a matter of fact, this is found to be indicated by the Bhavana which consists of the functioning of man towards a certain action and consequently, there can be no ground for assuming a potency, in the word, for the direct denotation of the Nominative.
yathaiva kvacidukkāpi karmānyatra na vakṣyati /	Though there are other Kārakas also that are found to be cognised through the Bhavana, yet a cognition or noncognition of these is not of any consequence, either one way or the other, in the matter under con sideration.
na tvanabhihita viśeṣaṇatvena kiṃ cidduṣyati yadi nāmāna bhihitamapi viśeṣaṇaṃ kena ciḍhanyena pratyāyyamānaṃ viśiṣṭa pratyayotpādanāya paryāptaṃ bhavati kiṃ tatrābhidhānānurodhena /	In any case, all that we need for the sake of the Bhāvanā itself is the Nominative and there is no doubt as to this latter being actually cognised and then, if in the wake of this, something else also be cognised, what harm does that do us? It is only the noncognition of something that could have troubled us, and not the cognition of some thing over and above what is actually needed.
asti ceha bhāvanayaiva pratyāyitasya kartturviśeṣapaṇatvaśaktiriti nābhidhānamapecate /	And as a matter of fact, even though the Instrumental,etc. are cognised, yet the peculiar potency of the word is such that they are not taken up by the Number which stands in need of the Nominative only.
na cedanyena śiṣṭā iti /	Nor is it necessary that the Number should take in every factor that happens, to be coguised. .

The Number The Number in question also, cognised only in a general way, does not stand in need of any other relative than the Nominative specially as we have already shown above that the only difference between the Word and the Sentence lies in the fact of the cognition of the meaning of the former always preceding that of the meaning of the latter.
yenānabhidheyaṃ kalapyeta /	Consequently, in the case of a Verb pucati f.i.
yadi hi kartā tatpratipādayituṃ śaknuyāttata ākṛtinyāyena sa evābhidheya itarattu vyaktivadgamyamānamityā śrīyate /	as soon as we have cognised the meaning of the Verbal Root paca, it is at once concluded that there must be a Bhāvunā and a Nominative with it and the Nomina tive being cognised beforehand, when the Number comes to be subsequently denoted by conjugational the Verbal Affix itself, it is found to be capable of being taken either as qualifying, or qualified by, that Nominative. Or again, the Nominative is the very first factor to be indicated by the Bhavanā and there can be no reason for the Number to pass over this Nominative and connect itself with something else.
yaḍhā tvekatvameva viśeṣaṇaṃ taḍhāpyavaśyaṃ tadeva prathamāntamabhidhātavyam / taccedabhihitaṃ cīpaśaktiḥ śabdaḥ karttāramanyataḥ sidhyantamapekṣate /	That is to say, though all Karakas are equally related to the Bha vana, yet, it is the Nominative that is the first to be sought after and taken up by this latter, specially as its relationship with the other Kārakas is dependent upon that i.e.
sau bhāvanāta iti nābhidhānaśakti kalpanā heturbhavati /	the Nominative. It is for this reason that the Bhavand, which consists of the functioning in general.

And there is no reason by which the Number should pass over the Nominative, which is the first and the most predominant factor to be indicated by the Bhavana,and be take itself to the other Kärakas.
eyanapeścitatvādayogyatvācca sannihitānyapi na sambandhitvaṃ pratipadyante / na ca teṣāmapi tiṅabhihitasaṃkhyābhilāṣī vidyate /	to the previously manifested Nominative only and it is for this reasout that it is this latter that becomes connected with Number, and appears as if it were actually deuoted, in its particular form by the Conjugational Affix. In the other Karakas, however, we do not find any such thing even though they are indicated, they are considered of no consequence, and as such appear as if they did not exist at all.
sarvatra subabhihitasaṃkhyāparicchedyatvāt /	But when we come to look into the real state of things, we find that all the Karakus are equally indicated by the Bhāvanā,with which they are equally con comitant and it is for this reason that they are not neglected altogether.. Objection In that case i.e.
na caiṣā saṃkhyā sāmānyarūpeṇa pratītā satī saṃvandhyantaramapecate / kathito hi paढ़vākya yorviśeṣaḥ paurvāparyaniyamāt /	if the Number belongs to the Nomi native exclusively, we could not have the number pertaining to the Objective, as we have in the sentence Olunaḥ paċyutām tvayā. Because in this sentence the action of the Rice that of being cooked is not spoken of as the principal factor for if it were, then what would be denoted would be the Nominative character of the rice and not the Bhavanā. That is to say, in the sentence cited, the action of the Rice is not spoken of as the principal factor, on account of which the number could be cognised as belonging to the Objective Rice cognised in the parti cular form of the Nominative.
tadyāvadeveca dhātvarthaḥ pratītastāvadeva kāpi bhāvanā karttā ca kaścidbhaviṣyatītyavadhāryate /	If it were so, then alone could the Rice lose its Objective character, and become the Nominative but as it is not so, it is not the Nominative and as it is not the Nominative, its functioning would not constitute the Bhivunā and as such there would be no particular indication of the Objective by the Bhāvanā.
avaśyaṃ ca puruṣavyāpāra eva prādhānyena vaktavyo 'nyathā hi pa ravyāpāre'sya niyoga eva na bhavet/ ākhyātapadena cākalpitaṃ kartṛtvaṃ padāntaropāttasyāpi nāvirbhavet /	As a matter of fact, it is necessary that the action of the human agent should be spoken of as the principal factor in all Injunctions it would not be possible for him to be directed to the performance of an action that belongs to something else the Objective, f.i. and such would be the case if the principal factor spoken of by the Injunctive sentence were the action of something other than the Nominative. And further, the Nominative character too, not being expressed by the Conjugational Affix in the sentence cited, could not apply even to that you which is spoken of by a distinct word tvujā and then we could not have the Instrumental in tvaya as this Instrumental is expressive of the Nominative, which has been found to be inapplicable to tvam.

tena pacatiśa bdavadeva pacyataityevamādyabhihitāpi saṃkhyā 'nabhibhūtatvātkatureva prāpnoti na karmaṇa iti / uccate	And thus we would find that, as in the case of the word pucati “Active, so in that of pacyate Passive also, the Number signified hy the word, not being subdued by that of any other, would come to belong to the Nominative, and not to the Objective as is really the case. Reply The above objection applies also to one who holds the Karaku Nominative or Objective to be denoted by the Conjugational Affix and as such applying to both parties, it should not have been brought forward against any one of them.
tadyadi mama karmotpannanakārīṣvapi karttureva saṃkhyā prāpnoti/	Because, in any case, the Number, which we hold to be denoted by the Verbal Affix, belongs to the very same Nominative or Objective that you hold to be denoted by the same Affix. Conseqnently, if even in the case of sentences in the Passive Voice lit.
tavāpi tarhi tatra kartrabhidhānena bhavitavyam / atha tatra tava kathaṃ citkatturanabhidhānaṃ tadanmamāpi tatsaṃkhyānabhidhānamityadoṣaḥ /	to belong to the Nominative which is absurd,then for you also, it would be the Nominative and not the Objective that would be signi fied by that Affix which would be equally absurd, as the sentence is in the Passive Voice. And if you could have some means of avoiding this absurd denotation of the Nominative, then the same would be available for us, for avoiding the denotation of the number belonging to the Nominative and as such we are no more open to the above objections than yourself.

karaṇādīnāṃ tuna vastucacaṇā nāpi śabdalacaṇā prādhānyavivacā 'stīti nityameva bāhya śabdopādeyatvam /	As for the other Karakas, the Instrumental and the rest, they can have no sort of predominance, either verbul or real and as such there can be no desire to speak of the predominance of these,and hence these are always spoken of by words other than the Verb and they do not, in any way, affect the form of the Verb.
yadaivaṃvidhaṃ śabdasāmarthyamavagamyate yathā'yaṃ karttava saṃkhyāṃ śaknoti vaktumayaṃ karmaṇa eveti /	Some people declare as follows “When the potentiality of words is ascertained to be in some such form as that,such and such a word the Active is capable of deuoting the number of the Nomina tive, while such other the Passive is capable of denoting only that “ of the Objective, then, in that case, the Bhavunä would be expressed by some other word and the said Number, being denoted as not belong ing to any other thing, would betake itself to the Nominative.
tadyathā śoṇa gando 'ngenānupātte'pyaśve tadgataṃ guṇaṃ vadannātmanaivāśvatvamapi gamayati /	For instance, in the case of the word Cona which, though signi fies Red, is yet applied only to the Red Horse, we find that even when the Horse is not mentioned by any other word in the shape of Açva and the like, the word Cona, expressing a property belonging to the Horse, comes, by itself, to indicate the Horse also.
tathā ca satyanenaiva nyāyena sarve gavādayo 'pyanabhidheyāḥ prāpnuvanti /	And in the saine manner, all things, such as the Cow and the like, would cease to be denoted by the words Cow and the like.
etāvatī cekabdaśaktiḥ kalpitā tadgatamevaiṣā guṇaṃ bravīti / kiṃ tataḥ paraṃ śaktyantarakalpanayā pūrvayaiva vyavahāropapateḥ /	Because the word Cow like the word Çona could be taken as expressing such properties of the Cow as its particular Gender, Numberetc. and these properties, being denoted by the word, would subsequently come to indicate the animals themselves. That is to say, if the sole potentiality of the word were to lie in the fact of its denoting the properties of a certain object, then, there would be no use for assuming any further potentialities for it as all usage would be carried on through that single potentiality.
ayaṃ tvevamādiṣvekaśabdopāttatvena saṃbandhaniyamo na śabdaśaktivaśena / tataḥ kartṛsaṃkhyādiṣvapi tadevābhyupagantavyamityanabhidheyatva hāniḥ /	If, however, it be held that in the case of such words as Çona and the rest their relationship is limited by the fact of both the Property as well as the Object being denoted by the same word, and not by any such peculiar potentiality in the word itself, then similarly in the case of the Number,etc. of the Nominative also it may be held that the connection of the Number with the Nominative is due, not to any potentiality in the Verbal Affix, but to the fact of both being expressed by the samo Affix and thus, in this way, there would be no harm done to the denotability of the Nominative.
tatrāpare manyante	Because the Redness exists in the Cow also.
kathaṃ hyaśvatve 'nucyamāne tadavacchinnaraktatva pratyayo jāyeta raktatvaviśeṣo me aśvatvaṃ naiva śogṇasya viśeṣaṇatayeṣyate /	That is to say, it is only that which is invariably con comitant with something else, that can indicate this latter while, as a matter of fact, we find that Relness is not invariably concomitant with the Horse consequently all that the word Cona could indicate would be the substance, with which latter alone is Redness invariably concomitant, and not any particular substance in the shape of the Horse.
guṇajātyantaraṃ tvetadvaivāttatsaṃgatiṃ gatam sarvapuṃsāṃ svasaṃvedyaṃ pratijāti guṇāntaram /	Thus then, inasmuch as both Redness and Horse are non comitant with one another, they cannot indicate one another and then, inasmuch as it would not be possible for either of them to take up the other, and this latter would be brought up by something else, we must adınit the fact of the word Cona actually denoting the Red Horse and not denoting mere Redness which would indicate the Horse.
atha yaduktaṃ gavādiṣvapi tadgatasaṃkhyādimātrābhidhānādeva jātiviśeṣa siddheranabhidhayatvaṃ prasajyata iti /	While in the case of the Nominative, we find that it is absolutely the only factor that is invariably indicated, and that too, in a particular form, by the Bhavana as explained above and hence there can be no real Analogy between the case of the word Cona indicating the Red Horse, and that of the Verbal Affix denoting the Bhavana, which would indicate the Nominative. Or, we can even admit that what the word Copa denotes is only the Property that coinheres in the same substrate i.e the individual Horse with the Class Horse.
yadi hi śoṣaṇatvādivagavāśvagatānā mekatvādīnāmapi pratyakṣeṇa viśeṣo jacyeta tata evaṃ kalpyeta /	That is to say, if the word Cona had denoted mere Redness, then it could have stood in need of either a qualification by the Class Horse, or a distinct potentiality whereby it could denote only that Redness. which would coinhere with itself in the same substrate.

And this peculiar kind of Redness belongs only to the Horse, and not to the Cow and other animals and it is for this reason that the word Çona is found to be indicative of the Horse precisely, and not vaguely and doubtfully, as in the case of the generic word Red. Question Which peculiar Redness is that which, being different from the Redness belonging to the Cow, etc., inheres in the Horse, and not in anything else ? Answer It is a fact known to all people that there is a distinct property for each Olass and this property is spoken of, sometimes in general, and sometimes in particular words.
anvayavyatirekābhyāṃ prātipadikena jātyabhidhānādvibhaktyā ca saṃkhyābhidhānā, nna cāneka śabdasyāne kārya kalpanā doṣaḥ / yadi tatrānekasya śabdasya śaktyanekatvaṃ na kalpyeta tato 'nyatarasyānarthakatvameva bhavet/ na ca saṃkhyā saṃkhyeyayora vyabhicāritvaṃ yenānyataraduccamānamitarasya gamakaṃ syāt /	That is to say, in all Classes, we distinctly perceive distinct proper ties of Blackness, Whiteness, Redness, etc., in keeping with the Individuals of each Class. And in some cases, there being no words expressive of the particular shade of the property meant, the property is spoken by the general word, the specification of the property being left to be done by something else while in other cases, there being words, like Cona, expressive of the particular grade of the property, this is mentioned in its particular form while in a third case, the particular grade of the property is expressed by certain words of the Vernacular peculiar to each country e.g. we have the expression Ruuhinika guuḥ for the red cow and the word raahinika would never be used in connection with the red horse, the red cloth, or any other red thing.
tathāhi	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the Conu the Red Horse, i.e.
nanu ca liṅgaṃ prātipadikenaivoccamānaṃ pratijāti vilakṣa pāmavyabhicārirūpeṇa pravarttamānaṃ śoṣatvāditulyaṃ syāt /	Nor can the word alone in its basic form Go denote both the Olass Cow and the Singular Number because by invariable concomitauce aud nonconcomitance, it is found that the word in its basic form denotes the Class, while the case ending donotes the Number. Nor could there be anything objectionable in accepting a multiplicity of denotations, when there is more than one denotative agent in the shape of the basic noun and the caseending. In fact when there is more than one denotative agent, if we did not admit of more than one denotation, then the use of one of the former either the basic noun or the caseending, f.i.
a tadevam	would be wholly superfluous.

That is to say, in the case of such words aja and the like =aju + ‘ṭāp, the affixes ṭāpetc. being merely indicative of the feminine character, they do not become distinct denotative words by themselves but all that they do is to create, in the previously existing word, a fresh potency expressive of the feminine character. And yet, prior to the addition of these feminine affixes, we still find the word in a definite form aja f.i.
tathā yatra vi bhaktisaṃbandhāt puṃstvaṃ napuṃsakatvaṃ cābhivyajyate tatrāpyevameva jātyabhidhānaṃ yojyam /	and while we have yet to recognize its Gender, we come to recognize its capability of denoting the Olass Goat and this capability once recognized can never be set aside.
yatra tu prāgeva vibhaktestannivṛttau vā satyāṃ śuddhādeva prātipadikādanyataraliṅgapratyayo bhavati ya thā istī nā devadattaḥ śrīḥ marittoyaṃ vārīti /	Similarly too, in the case of those words in which the Masculine or Neuter character is manifested by the casetermination the words Sadhuḥ and Madhu f.i., we would have a denotation of the Class, prior to the manifestation of the Gender. In the case of those words, however, in which, even before the addition of the caseendings, or after the elimination of these, the pure basic form of the word gives an idea of the Gender,e.g. the words Hasti, Nā, Dēvadatta, Cri, Sarit, Toya and Vari if we admit what you say, there would be nothing objectionable in it.
atha vā vināpi śabdavibhāgenārthapratītāvutpādyamānāyāṃ sarvaṃ svasaṃvedyena vibhāgena prathamataraṃ jātiṃ pratipadyate /	Or even in the case of these words, inasmuch as the meaning would he correctly recognized, even without a differentiation of the word into its basic form and the caseending.it is the Olass and not the Gender that should be regarded as the very first to be cognized, by a process of differentiation known to all men. Then again, Masculinityetc. are properties belonging to the Indivi duals and as such there can be no cognition of these before the Indivi duals have been cognized. While the Class is so intimately connected with the denotative potency of the word, that unless that is egnized, there is no cognition of any such potency in the word.
tena kāmaṃ liṅgameva jātigamyaṃ bhavenna jātirliṅgagamyā /	For these reasons, it must be admitted that it is the Gender that is indicated by the Class, and not vice versa.
nityaṃ copasarjanībhūtamevaitadgamyamānaṃ nārhati prādhānyena pratīyamānāyā jātera bhiṣeyatvaṃ vārayitum /	Specially as the Gender is always recognized as the subordinate element, and hence it could never set aside the denotability of the Class which is found to be denoted as the predominant factor.
na ca gopaśvādiśabdadhvanyataraliṅgābhivyaktirjātivadasti /	As a matter of fact too, we find that in the case of the words go, pagu and the like, there is no manifestation of any Gender, as there is that of the Cluss. Conse quently it is the Class that should be admitted as forming the denota tion of the word.
yacāpi vyabhicāre satyanyataḥ pratīyate tatra tadeva gamakaṃ tadanugṛhītā vā jātiḥ prātipadikaṃ veti yatheṣṭaṃ kalpyate /	And in a case where it would not be incompatible with the Gender, it would indicate this latter also and in a case where the Class is not compatible with the Gender, and this is cognized by some other means, it is this latter means that would serve as its indicator or it would be either the Class as aided by the other means, or the basic form of the word itself, we could assume anything we liked.
tasmānnatantravārtika / śoṣāditulyatā /	For these reasons, the case of such words as Go and the rest that denote the Class cannot be said to be similar to that of the word Çöna.
pacatyādiśabdeṣvapi yadi saṃkhyā sarvakārakāntaravyāvṛttarūpaṇa kartṛmātrānusāriṇī śoṇatvavadupacabhyeta tatastayā nāma karttā gamyatāṃ tāvatā 'pyana bhidheyo bhavatyeva /	In the case of the words pacatietc. also, if the Number were cognised as separate from all the other Karakas, as following in the wake of the Nominative only, like the character of Conutva, which resides in the Horse only, then, in that case, we could very well admit the fact of the Nominative being indicated by that Number. But that too would leave the Nominative umnlenoted by the Conjugational Affix.
yadā tu pūrvoktena nyāyena saṃkhyābhedo na labhyate prativastu cānantānyekatvādijātyantarāṇi na śakyante kalpayituṃ tadā bhāvanāghātvarthābhyāmevopādānamādarttavyam/	As a matter of fact, however, we are cognizant of a difference in Number and certainly we could not very well go on assuming the existence of an endless number of singlenesses, with regard to each single Individual that we might come across and hence we cannot but accept the fact of the Nominative being indicated only by the Bhavand and the Rootmeaning. septe Then again, in the case of the assertion Cono dhavati the Ches nut is running, we find that there is no other word except Conah giving as an idea of the Class and it is for this reason that in this parti cular case, we have admitted of the aforesaid complicated process of inter pretation.
kiṃ ca	That, however, cannot be admitted in the case in question.
yadi śoṇasyāpi kaścidadbhyo 'śvamupanayennaivāsau svayaṃ kliśyet /	That is to say, if we had another word pointing to the horse in the case of the sentence Cono davati, then we could not have twisted this same word Conah so mercilessly.
saṃkhyāyāśca bhāvānādhātvarthābupanetārāviti na svayamāyasyati /	we have the Bhavana and the Rootmeaning that would bring forward and indicate the Nominative related to it and hence there is no need for twisting the Number itself into giving us the idea of the Nominative.
bhāvanopasthāne cokto viśeṣaḥ /	And the special reasons, that we have for believing the Nominative to be indicated by the Bhavand alone, we have already explained before.
tasmādanabhidheyasyaiva kartuḥ viśeṣyatva viśeṣaṇatvopapattera pramāṇamabhidhānaśaktikalpana mityavagacchāmaḥ /	Thus then we find that, even when the Nominative is directly denoted by the Verbal Affix it is quite capable of bearing to the Number f.i. the relationship of the qualification and qualified and consequently we conclu le that the assumption of the denotability of the Nominative is wholly groundless. The denotability of the Nominative having, in the above manner, been shown, by reasonings, to be groundless, the Vaiyakurana proceeds to show the incompatibility of the view thus arrived at with the scriptures i.e.
prakṛtipratyayā pratyayārthaṃ saha brūta ityācāryopadeśātkarttā śabdārthaḥ karma cetyavagamyataiti /	the Rules and Maxims laid down in the Grammatical Scriptures. Inasmuch as we have the teachers declaration that the basic word and the affic conjointly express the denotation of the Affic, we must “admit that what is actually denoted by the Conjugational Affix is the Nominative, and also the Objective.
nanu sūtrārthenaivāgamavirodhe darśita prakṛtipratyayā pratyayā rthamityetadasaṃbaddvam / kathamasaṃbaddhaṃ yadā pūrveṇa nyāyena kartuḥ prādhānyamapi pūrvapakṣavādinā darśayitavyam /	Reply How can it be said to be irrelevant, when is is necessary for the Purvapakshi to establish the fact of the Nominative being the predominant factor and it is only the Assertion quoted, and not the Sūtra, that has any bearing upon that point. And hence what is meant by citing the authority of both is to show that there are Smrtis in support of the theory that the Nominative is directly denoted, as also that it is the predominant factor.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	improper.
anyattu karttaroti parasaptamī na ca śabda saṃniveśe karttā paratrāvasthitaḥ saṃbhavatyata ānarthakyāttadaṅgeṣviti śabde kāryaṃ vijñāyate /	To the above we make the following reply The Teachers of Grammar say nothing as to the relationship of the Denotative and the Denotable i.e. they do not say anything as to certain things being denoted by certain words this is inferred from actual usage, through the Apparent Inconsistency of this nsage. That is to say, the incompatibility of Verbal Authority could be rightly urged only in that case where the Reasoning and the Verbal Authority both pertain to the same subject.
sarvathā tāvatpratyayārthaḥ karttavyuktamācāryestasmādayuktamanabhidheyatvānumānamiti /	In the case in question, however, we find that while the Reasoning treats of the question as to what is directly denoted, and what is indirectly implied by the Affix. the grammatical authorities cited treat of a wholly distinct question, as to which among a number of synonymous words is correct, and which incorrect, in form.
na cānya viṣayeṇānyaviṣayasya durbalasthāpi bāgho yuktaḥ kimuta vāccagamyamānaviṣayatvena pratyakṣameva sarvasvasaṃvedyasya /	And certainly when two things treat of two wholly distinct subjects, one cannot set aside the other, even though this latter may be weaker in authority and a rejection is all the more improper when what is sought to be rejected treats of the wholly different subject of the denotation and implication by the Verbal Affix, and is as well known to all men as any fact of ordinary senseperception.
tena yadyapi karttā śabdārtha iti evamācāryā vadeyustathāpi svaviṣayādanyatra vadanto nādarttavyā bhaveyuḥ /	Thus then, even if the Tenchers of Grammar had actually made the declaration that the Nominative is denoted by the Conjugational Affix, we could not attach much importance to such a declaration in the present connection, which deals with a wholly different subject.
te tu naiva tathā vadanti /	As a matter of fact, however, we find that they do not make such a declaration.

tatra hokekasminpade prāyeṇāṣṭādhyāyī vyāpriyate /	Specially is this the case with the text of Grammatical Sutras because, in this, we find almost the whole Eight Adhyayas of the Satras operating in the formation of a single worl.

bahutve dinvaikatvayoriti vivaraṇāt /	Specially because, inasmuch as the Property has been already abstracted beforehand, the use of an Abstracting or Abstract Affix would be wholly superfluous.
kathamantareṇa bhāvapratyayaṃ bhāvapradhāno bhavati nirdeśa iti pṛṣṭe bhavati yadā prathama eva guṇaḥ svaprādhānyena vivacyataiti vyākṛtam /	Reply It is quite true that such would be the natural consequence but, just as in certain cases, the Adjective, with a view to point to the Sub. stance to which the Property denoted by that Adjective belongs, hecomes coextensive with the word substantive denoting that substance,so, in the same manner, there is the coextensiveness, with the Adjective, of the Substantive which is used with a view to express the Property to which the Substance idenoted by that Substantive is subordinate specially as in both cases we have the same grounds for taking both the Adjective and the Substantive as nondifferent, or one of them as indirectly indi cating the other.
tathā pūrvameva guṇaḥ kaścitvātantryeṇa vidhīyate /	If, however, it happens to be met with, in a certain case, then it should be explained in the manner For these reasons, it must be admitted that even without the use of the Abstract Affix, we can speak, quite intelligibly, of a Property Num. ber f.i. as the predominant factor.
kaścid dravyāṅgabhāvena tato niṣkṛṣya cāparaḥ	should have had the Singular ending but this objection has been met by showing that in such expressions the word eke means others and as snch is capable of taking the plural ending.
hye kasaṃkhyeyasaṃghāte bahutvamupajāyate /	Thus it becomes established that what the Sutras Bahushu bahuva canametc. Iiv, mean is that we have the Plural ending where there is multiplicity manyness, and the Singular and the Dual endings, where we have Sinyleness and Duality respectively.
iye keṣviti bhavettatra yadi saṃkhyeyatantratā	The former alternative is untenable as the tip cannot be related to any one of them unless they are specified or qualified by the other.
anekasminnapi prāptiḥ karttari syāttipastathā /	Because, in accordance with this alternative, we would have the tip affix even in a case where we have more than one Nominative as also when ever there would be Singleness, even in any of the Kārakas.
śāstre hi kāryavaśenāna bhidheyasyāpyabhidheyatvaṃ pāribhā tantravārtike /	And as for the relationship by Vaiyyadhikaranya difference in the substrata, inasmuch as no such relationship is, directly expressed by the words, it could only be due, either to the process of indirect Indication by one or the other, or to the modifying of the caseendings the form being changed into Kartuḥ ehateam.

Thus then, the upshot of the whole set of Satras comes to be that the NumbersSinglenessetc. as qualified by the Nominative or the Objective are denoted by the Conjugational Affixes and hence there is no incompati bility in our theory with the verbal authority of the said grammatical rules. The said Sutras being explained in the above manner, the conclusion that we have arrived at by a course of reasoningviz., that there is no denotation of the karakas because of their being indicated by the Bhävand would be found to be quite in keeping with the sense of the Sutras.

For if the Objective were already denoted by the Conjugational Affixes, Nominal affixes or Compounds, then there would be left no reason for any further denoting of the Objective by the Accusative or the Nominative terminations, with a view to which we should have had the conditional Sutra Anabhihitë . On the other hand, when the Objectiveetc. are not denoted by the Conjugational Affixes, etc., then, unless we had the Sutras specially laying down the Accusative terminations, with reference to the Singleness,etc. of that Objective, we could not have the Accusative ending in such cases.

It is in view of these facts that, in recapitulating the position taken up by the author of the Vartika Katyāyana, Patanjali has declared It is only when the Singleness,etc. are denoted by the Conjugational Affix,etc. that the conditional Sūtra ‘anabhihitë becomes necessary while if the Objective,etc. were denoted by them, the Sutra would be absolutely meaningless.

And in that case, your theory would be incompatible with such expressions as +yatkaraṇabhidhãyinya Irtiyavibhaktyä samyujya nirdiçati, tadāgamë hi tad drçyatë, tasya jñānumetc. which are found in your own Bhashya. LS To this some people make the following reply Inasmuch as we find that it is quite possible for the same rule to be taken differently, in accordance with the different purposes served by it, with regard to different objects, and that the nature of the qualifying relationship is found different in different cases, we speak of the Number as the qualified factor, in the case of Conjugational Affixes, and as the qualifying factor in that of the Declensional ones. If however this explanation should not satisfy you, we offer you another Though the Rules do not accept the denotability of the Objec tive etc., yet they speak of such denotability, only for the sake of the accomplishment of that which has been accepted as the denotable i.e.
nanu ca kevalakāraka padaprayogābhāvādavaṇyaṃ bhāvyākhyātapadābhihitabhāvanopanītānāmeva kārakāṇāṃ ticiva saṃkhyāsaṃbandho 'vakalpiṣyate /	Nor have we any rules laying down that the Objective and the rest are never denotable what they do lay down is that these Objectiveetc. are the qualifications of the Numbers, Singlenessetc. which are the actual denota tions of the Conjugational Affixes,as we have already explained above. Hence it must be admitted that the Objective and the other kärakas always serve as qualifying subordinates in the case of Conjugational Affixes. Thus then, in a case where the Objectiveetc. are not found, either by reasonings, or by Verbal authority, to have the said denotability, they are at once recognized as absolutely undenotable.

Objection Inasmuch as the Noun is never used by itself, it is necessary that it should always be accompanied by a Verb and as this Verb would denote a Bhavana, it would be as indicated by this Bharana that the kirakas, in this case of Declensional Affix also, would be connected with the Number denoted,exactly as in the case of the Conjugational Affixes.
satyam /	Reply How could it be so, when, as a matter of fact, we find that in sentences, whereof the order of sequence among the words is not fixed.
vakturevaṃ, śrotā punaḥ prathamameva vṛkṣamiti śruṇoti na tena kriyā tatsaṃbandho vānyataḥ pūrvamavadhāritaḥ	the Noun is used before the Verb, e.g in the sentence Vrksham chin dhi aud in this case we find that the cognition of the käruku Vyk shamappears before that of the Verb and certainly this cognition of the kāraku would not be possible unless the käruka were denotable, inde pendently by itself. Objection Even in this case, as the käraka would not be a true kāraka, unless connected with the Verb, the karakuendings would not appear until the relationship with the Verb were distinctly shown.

tadiha yadi kriyāgamyaṃ kārakaṃ tataḥ kriyā kena pratyāyyataiti vaktavyama / na ca tāvar̤acaprātipadikaṃ kriyāyā vācakaṃ śākhādimajjātimāṃtravacanatvāt /	But in the But in the case in ques tion, if the karaku were to be indicated by the Verb, then it would be necessary to explain by what the Verb is indicated. Then, we find that the basic Noun Vrksha in the sentence Vrkshumchindhi cannot indicate the verb because what the word denotes is the Class character ized by the presence of branchesetc. Nor could the denotation of the basic Noun indicate it as this is quite possible even without the action expressed by the verb and as such there could be no Apparent Inconsis tency justifying the indication. The following might be urged by the opponent There is no such thing as is absolutely devoid of some sort of an action consequently in the case of all Nouns, we would always have the indication of some such Verb as is, exists and the like.
nāpi prātipadikārtho gamako vināspi kriyayopapatteḥ /	Nor is the Number denoted by the ending capable of indicating any particular Verb or karaka, as we have explained before.

And such being the case, if the Verb also were to be the indicator of the karaka, then this would be a clear case of mutual inter dependence, which would make both the idea of the Verb, as also that of the karaka equally devoid of a foundation. For these reasons, it must be admitted that, in the case of the denoted by the Affix and the käraka indicates the Verb, in keeping with its own character, through the relationship borne by them to each other.
kutaḥ /	Objection In the case of a sentence in which the Verb precedes the Noun e.g.
tiṣṭhatyādāvupāte 'pi kriyāmātre hyakarma ke /	Reply Such would certainly have been the case, if the sentences had always begun with the Verb.

Specially as the relationship between words and their deno tations is not transitory and it has already been shown above that this relationship is conditioned by the mutual limitation imposed by the potentialities of the Word and its Denotation upon each other.

When, on the other hand, the thing does not exist, even when its supposed effects would appear, it could not be got at even by the gods themselves and as such we would have to admit the appearance of an effect without a cause an absurdity, as we have already explained in course of our explanation of the eternality of the relationship between words and their denotations vide Çloka Vārtika, section, Sambandhakshēpāparihāru.
tatkalpitā vācakaśaktinīma pūrvaṃ tāvatprayoga vyāpariṣyate /	Consequently when the denotative potency of the Affix with regard the kärakas has been definitely ascertained, it will operate, to its fullest extent, in the case of the sentence in which the Noun precedes the Terb while it will be indifferently inoperative in the case of the sentence where the reverse is the case i.e.
viparyaye punarudāsiṣyate /	The case of the Arundhikaraṇa is different from this because in this latter we found that the class cow and the Property of Redness brought about, in regard to the object qualified by them i.e.
labdhātmakatvāddā śrautatve satyanumānapratyayaṃ nirākurvanto kāryamārarāsyate / ataśca siddhā supāṃkamadiyo 'pyarthāstiṅāṃ tu niyatapaurvāparyavaśādekāntena dhātvarthabhāvanābhyāmupasthāpitayoḥ kartakarmaṇoḥ paścātsaṃkhyā 'vagamyataiti na kadā cidapi kārake viśeṣago vācakatṛtīyādhyāyasya caturtha pāda /	the individual cow, ideas in keeping with their own characters and hence we admitted the Elimination of the Possessive Affix by taking ‘aruņu as aruṇavat and the Im position of Identity of the class on the Individual and it was on account of these two causes, that the words were found to have brought about the necessary coordination. In the case in question, however, we find that the sentence does not give rise in us to any idea of such actions of Devadatta, as the laying of the potetc. and hence we cannot admit of any such facts as the Elimination of the Possessive Affix and the Imposition of Identity. Consequently, just as we never find the word Danda to be coextensive with Devadatta, in any such sentence as Dando Dévadattaḥ,or just as we have no such expression as Adhiprayaṇādayo Devadattah, or Pako Devadattuḥ,so, also, we could not have the expression pacati Devalattaḥ! Thus then, we have the following inferential arguments in sup port of our view The word pacati is denotative of the Nominative and the Objective, because it is coextensive with the word expressive of these, just as in the case of the words pakta and pakovaḥ! t By the expression coextensive with the words expressive of these we mean the identity of substrates.
śaktikalpanāvasaraḥ /	in the case of the word pākaḥ i.e.
tataśca nityānumeye karṭa karmaṇo iti siddham tantravārtika / abhedavarttitvaṃ hi tatpadasāmānādhikaraṇyamasaṃdigdhavācakeṣu kṛdanteṣu paktā devadattaḥ pakka odana ityādiṣu dṛṣṭam /	we have never such an expression as ‘pako Devadattaḥ which shows that the very presence of the expression pacati Devadattaḥ shows that there is a coextensiveness between the denotations of these two words, and that therefore the word pacati must be taken as denoting the Nominative. Then again, the word pacati must be denotative of the Nominative, because it is found to follow the changes of Number that are made in the word expressive of the Nominative,just as is the case with the two words cited above paktā and pakvaḥ. That is to say, we find such expressions as pacati Devadattaḥ, pacato Devadattayajñadattau, pacanti Devadattayajñadattavishnu dattāḥ and from these we infer that the Number of the Verbs is exactly the same as that in the words expressing the Nominative.
yatra ca kartakarmavacanatvaṃ nāsti tattra sāmānādhikaraṇyamadṛṣṭaṃ yathā pākādiśabde /	Wherever we find such to be the case, i.e. such keeping in accordance with the Number of the Nominative word we find the word to be actually denotative of the Nominative e.g.

ataśca vācako yenā nabhihitādhikāravihitakārakavibhaktipratibandho dṛśyate /	That is to say, for the following reason also the Verb must be regarded as denotative of the Nominative and the Objective Because we find a dropping off of the caseendings whose appearance is conditioned by the fact of the Karakas being notdenoted,e.g.
pacati devadattaḥ pacyate odana iti /	pacati Devadattah and pacyate odanah.
yadi hi vācakatvaṃ na syāt tato 'nabhihite karmaṇi dvitīyā kartṛkara gāyostṛtīyeti ca vibhaktiprāptirna kena citpratibadhyeta /	If the Verb were not denotative of the Nominative, then there would be nothing to justify the dropping off of the affixes laid down by such sūtras as ‘anábhihitė karmaṇi dvitīya, Pāṇini, ‘kartrkaraṇoyostrtiyā Pāṇini such as we find in the expression pacyate Devadattēna, pacatyodanaḥ.
yatastu khalu pratibandha stenāvagagyate paktṛpakvasādharmyeṇaiva vācakatvaṃ sādharmyādanya hai dharmyaṃ tadevaṃ darśayitavyam /	As a matter of fact however, in asmuch as we find that these affixes are actually dropped off, we con clude, from this, that, like the words paktā and pakvah, the Verb pacati is denotative of the Nominative and the Objective.
yatva ca vācakatvaṃ nāsti tatva kārakavibhaktipratibandho 'pi nāsti yathā paccate devadattena pacatyodanamiti /	This instance of similarity having thus been shown, it becomes necessary to show that of dissimilarity and this we have in such sentences as pacyate Devadatlēna, etc., in which we find that, inasmuch as the Verb does not denote the Nominative, there is no dropping off of the Nomina tive ending.
itaśca bodhakaḥ śabdasta hiśeṣāvabodhanāt /	‘ The Verb denotes the Nominative and the Objective because it expresses the qualifications of these,just as the Ear, being the indicator of the letter a, is indicative of Sound in general.
yathā śrotramakārastha bodhakaṃ śabdabodhanam	For instance, the Ear is not found to be nonindicative of Sound in general, and yet indicative of the particular sound of the letter a. And for words, there can be no other indicativeness than that of being denotative.
itaścābhidhīyete viśeṣaṇaiḥ saṃbadhyamānatvādiha śobhanaḥ pacati śobhanaḥ pacyate /	And for this reason also, the Verb must be regarded as denotative of the Nominative and the Objective. inalte Lastly, the Nominative and the Objective are denoted by the Verb,because of the connection of these with qualifications, as that which is itself not denoted could never be connected with its qualifica tions.
yavānayorviśeṣaṇa saṃbandhastavābhimeyatvamapi dṛṣṭaṃ yathā śobhana paktā ramaṇīyaḥ pakka iti /	That is to say, for the following reason also, the Verb must be regarded as denotative of the Nominative and the Objective Because we find these connected with their qualifications,e.g. in the sentences pobhanaḥ pacati, çobhanah pacyate. Whenever we find them con nected with their qualifications, we find them to be denoted e.g. in the expressions çobhanaḥ paktā, ramaṇiyaḥ pakvah.

Nor could the connection with qualifications belong to that which is indicated by the Bhāvanā, f.i. e.g. though the word smoke indicates the Fire, yet it does not indicate it as connected with the qualifications of Heat, Brightness, and the like.

If by this argument, you seek to infer the existence of the particular denotative potency,then, inasmuch as the way, to such a potency, of all means of right notion is blocked by the aforesaid explanatian of Apparent Inconsistency, you would be contradicting the authority of Negation. And it is a wellknown fact that of all potencies, Apparent Inconsistency is the only means of cognition and inasmuch as in the case in question, this Inconsistency is capable of being explained in another way i.e.

As it is, however, what we do is to deny the absence of the capability, in the Verb, of directly denoting the Nomi native and the Objective, and that, in these latter, of being denoted by the Verb and certainly in this denial there is nothing incompatible with.
pratyayotpādamātreṇa kṛtārthasya lokasyābhidheyagamyamānadyotya viṣaya rūpārthacatuṣṭaya vivekā nādarāt /	Because ordinary people rest contented with the fact of having the mere idea of the Nominative and the Ob jective brought about by the Verbal Affix and they do not take the trouble to make any distinctions as to what is directly denoted, indicated, implied and what forms the subject of the Verb.
yadi tu lokaprasiddhaṃ pratyāyya pratyāyakatvamātraṃ sādhyeta tataḥ prāguktena bhāvanāhārapratītyabhyupagamātsiisādhanam /	If what you have sought to prove, by the aforesaid series of argu ments, be the mere fact of the verb giving some sort of an idea of the Nominative and the Object,then all your effort is absolutely super fluous as we also admit of a cognition of these being brought about by the Verb, through the Bhavanā.

yathā śrotragṛhītatvātsvarūpaṃ nābhidhīyate	Because what is got at by any other means, is never attributed, by ordinary men, to the action of denotation for instance, the form of the word, being cognised by the Ear, is never held to be denoted by the word itself. .

In the case of one who holds the käraka to be a substance, that sub stance, which, somehow or other, would be recognised as having the character of the kāraka, would wholly lose its character, and would, therefore, pervade over all the kärakas that there might be in the sentence, just like the Class which pervades over all individuals and as such it could be spoken of as all these other kärakas also.

yogyatāvaśeneti ke cit /	d And that part of the word which does take up the varying num bers, ie.

na cākārakasya sataḥ śrākhyātena saṃbandho 'vakalpate /	But this is not possible because as a matter of fact, we know that wherever an affix appears, it does so with the purpose of bringing about an idea, either of Number or of the Käraka while in the case in question, we find that both of these the Number and the Nominative are fully established by the Bhāvaná and the Declensional affix.

And the Verb is never related to anything that is not a kāraka, and it is for this reason that it is bis Nemiuative character that is taken up. But this explanation would not apply to the case of the sentence ‘kāṣṭhāni pacanti because the fuels are capable, not of the Nomina tive character, but of the Instrumental, as is well known.

When, however, the Nominative is not denoted by the conjugational forms, that which is meant to be spoken of as being related to the number signified by the Verbal Aflix would be duly cognised, even if it did not bring in its special caseending because it will have obtained its result, and the Ending is only one such result while the other karakas i.c.
evaṃ ca sati yatkarmasaṃkhyā 'pi kvacidabhidhīyate tavoktaṃ kāraṇaṃ na ca tadanyāvastīti vyavasthā /	Reply This objection does not apply to the case in question because, though the kärakas, being indicated, in their forms, by the Bhavana, could not bring about their respective caseendings for that same purpose of indicating those forms,yet the number signified by the Verbal Affix becomes fully utilised by being connected with any one of the said kärakas and hence for the sake of the other numbers ie.
tadā tvanabhihitādhikāro 'yevaṃ kariṣyate /	those belonging to the other karakas, it would be necessary to make use of the other caseendings.
anabhiṣṭite karmaṇa ekatve dile bahutve cetyādi / kutaḥ /	L Objection That number alone, which is signified by the Verbal Affix, would be equally related to all the Kārakus and hence the use Reply How could that number, being one only, be related to all? If it did become connected with all of them, different numbers would have to appear in regard to cach Karaka.
vibhaktayo vidhīyante yatra tastha viśeṣagām /	As for the possibility of the various numbers being optional alternatives, we accept it as nothing undesirable for us.
yujyate 'nabhidhānaṃ hi na punastahiśeṣaṇe	Because even this option would be limited by actual usage and the assumption could not be carried on just as one might happen to wish at the time of using the word.
yasya ca karmādayo vācyā yasya ca tahiśiṣṭā ekatvādayastayorubhayorapyanabhihitatvaṃ karmādiviśeṣagām /	Consequently, it must be admitted that it is the word that has been used, at the very outset, with the Nominative caseending, which is meant to be spoken of as connected with the Number denoted by the Verbal Affix and hence the other words would stand in need of the caseendings belonging to the several Karakas.
yadyapi copasarjana karmādayastathāpi viśeṣagona saṃbadhyante /	Objection But in a case where the number denoted by the Verbal Affix is the Plural, inasmuch as there would be enough numbers to be connected with every one of the Karakas,there would be no necessity, in this case of the caseendings pertaining to these Kärakas.

When however, the Verbal Affix denotes the Plural Number pertaining to the Nomi “native only,while the other Kārakas are directly spoken of as mere subsidiaries,then, inasmuch as, on account of the fact of the Nomi native being the first to be mentioned, and also of its being the predomi nant factor, the Number would be connected with the Nominative, and as there would be no reason for passing over this Nominative,the Number could not betake itself to the other Karakas consequently it becomes wholly swallowed up in the Nominative and as for the Num bers of the Karakas, they are expressed by their own respective case endings.
gatārthavādaprāptiriti cenna / bhīṣmādibhiranekāntāt /	Because we do not find any reason, by which the principal factor the Nominative should be passed over by the Number in question and as for the Nominative character being meant by any person to be expressed, there can be nothing objectionable in that.
uktaṃ hyetatkaṭadvitīyayokte 'pi karmaṇi bhauṣamādibhyastadutpattiriti / yadi ca tṛtīyā gatārthatvānnotpadyate tataḥ prathamāvācyā 'pi saṃkhyā gataiveti kāmaṃ sā notpadyate /	As a matter of fact, we find that where ever two meanings are possible, it is only right that we should desire the one or the other to be conveyed by the word and in the case in question, we find that, all the Kärakus are endowed with the character of the Nominative, with regard to their own respective functions specially as the diversity of the Karakas, with regard to the principal Verb, could not be possible, if they were wholly devoid of the Nominative character, in regard to their own respective functions.
kevalaprātipadika prayogāsambhavāttadutpattiriti cet /	Consequently, it is only right that this Nominative character should be accepted as that which is desired to be spoken of by means of the word Sthali .
na evaṃ sati yathāvihitatatoyāprasaṅgāt /	and as such the Verb pucati cannot be taken as denoting the num bers pertaining to the other Karakas. Thus then, the same reason would also apply to the case where the Verbal Affix denotes the number of the Objective e.g.
na cāgamavirodhe nyāyaḥ kāryakṣamo bhavati /	But the same reason does not apply to the other. Kārakas besides the Objective and the Nominative and as such there is a distinct limit to the application of the said reasoning.
tasmādanabhihitaśabda eva lakṣaṇayā viśeṣātmanā 'navagatṛtīyādhyāyasya caturthaḥ pāda /	And thus, the anabhihita rules would be explained as follows When we have the singleness, duality or plurality, of the Objective not mentioned, then we have the Accusative Ending, etc., etc.,etc. The qualification notexpressed anabhihita could rightly be applied to that alone with reference to which we find the caseendings laid down and it cannot be applied to the qualification of this latter.

It is for this reason that we have a declaration, in connection with compounds, to the effect that even if the Primary factor be wanting in certain elements, it can form a compound. Consequently the sutra anabhihite Panini IIi must be explained as when the singleness,etc. are not explained. G But in accordance with this interpretation, we would have the Accusative Ending in both words, in the expression Krtah katah as in both of them we have the singleness of the Objective notexpressed. It might be argued that inasmuch as the singleness is expressed by the Nominative Ending, there could be no Accusative Ending nonexpres.
kārakatvāviśeṣe 'pi ca yathā karttakarmaṇoreva viśeṣapratītiḥ saṅkhyāsambandhaśca bha vatīti tathoktam /	Objection The same might be urged against one who holds that the Accusative and other endings denote the objective,etc. because in that case also, as the objective character will have been expressed by the Accusative in katam, the same affix could not appear in connection with the other words.

tatrocyate /	Objection For me also, the sutra would serve the purposes of the said preclusion.
tulyo 'bhidhānapakṣe 'pi sa doṣaḥ śabdagocaraḥ / vācakasyāpyanekānto gamakasyeva neṣyate	Reply This could have been possible, if the number were denotable by the Art and other affixes also .e. the affixes other than the Verbal and the Nominal. As a matter of fact, however, we do not find any such Affixes, either laid down to be expressive of the number, or actually expressing it, in any sentence. Consequently it is the Verbal conjuga tional Affix only that can be accepted to be expressive of number the Nomi nal Affixes and Compounds not expressing the Number by themselves.
athāpi lakārasyaiva vācyā kamadiyo 'pyucyante tathā 'pi tenānabhidhīyamānāḥ santaḥ prāgādeśotpatterna śakyāstathā 'dhyavasātum /	Consequently another explanation must be given in regard particularly to the sentence krtaḥ kataḥ. For one for whom the Karakas, the Objective, and the rest, are denoted by the Verbal Affix,as also for him who regards the singleness,etc. as qualified by these Objective,etc. to be denoted by it, the fact of being notexpressed anablihita must be taken as qualifying the Objective and the other Karakas the meaning of the sutras beingthat when the Objective is notexpressed we have the Accusative, or that we have the Accusative Ending in connection with the singleness,etc. that reside in the Objective that is notexpressed.

Even though nonconcomitant, if the Verb, in this latter case, were yet to perform the denotative function, by being aided by some other agency, then for us also, it could similarly perform the function of indicating the same thing And hence, just as for the Vaiyakarana, the denotativeness of the Verb is cognised through such agencies as the Tran sitive and Intransitive Verb, the presence of intermediate affixes other than cyan, and certain particular prefixesso would also its indicative. Otherwise, we find that the particlete that we find in pacyatë.

But, in view of various other reasons shown above, adherence should be accorded to the theory that the Nominative is indicated by the Bhāvanā. Or, we may take the word anabhihite in its direct denotative sense.
kiṃ punarasya prayojanaṃ yadā na lokavedayoste tathopalabhyete /	Question Bnt, in that case, why should not we have the Instrn mental Nominative in the sentence pacati Devadattaḥ? Answer Simply because its appearance has been negatived i.e.

kathaṃ nāmānabhihitādhikāreṇa lakāraprayāge tayorabhihitatvāśrayaṇātparyudāsaḥ syāditi /	Question How has it been precluded? Answer It has been precluded by the fact of the Nominative having been expressed by the Verbal Affix. Question As you now admit the fact of the Nominative being denoted by the Verb,wherefore should you have taken all the trouble.
tasmādyadyapi paramārthato nābhidhīyete tathā'pi śākhe 'bhihitavadāśrayaṇāinabhihitādhikāravihita bibhakto na lakṣyete iti parihṛtaḥ kārakavibhaktiprasaṅgaḥ /	you have, to show that it is not so denoted ? Answer We did that for the sake of with reference to ordinary parlance of the world, and for the Veda,and not for grammatical purposes. Question Are the purposes of grammar something different from those of ordinary life and the Veda ?. Answer Certainly for instance, such technical words as Vrddhi and Guna are not found, either in ordinary parlance or in the Veda, to denote ataic and aten respectively. Objection It is only natural that the word la should be used for the lādēças the substitutes for la, i.e. the affixes tip and the rest as it is a general rule that the attributing of a certain meaning to the original i.e.
yattu tadviśeṣābhidhānāditi ta cchiṃśapādiśabdara nai kāntikam / śiṃśā śabdo hi na tāvaha kṣatva pārthivatvadravyatva sattā prameyatvajñeyatvānāmabhidhāyako 'tha ca tahiśeṣameva śiṃśapāmabhidhatta /	Reply This is scarcely admissible because in that case by taking the letter as signifying the substitutes, we have recourse to the indirect process of Indication and it could be only an indirect Indica tiveness that would pertain to the substitutes through the original. That is to say, though the word we hear is only la, yet, we would take it as signifying the substitutes and this would involve a rejection of Direct Denotation. Then if the Objective and the rest also be said to form the denotations of the letter la, then, inasmuch as they are not actually denoted by it, they could not be recognised as so expressed, until the substitutes had been brought in.
tena yathā 'sya sāmānyamanabhidhāya viśeṣābhidhānaśaktirna viruvyate yathā ca cakṣuṣaḥ sāmānyamanityatvamagṛhato 'pi rupagrahaṇaśaktirna virudhyate yathā ca bhavato 'pi dravyamamabhidhāyaiva tiṅā tadviśeṣaḥ kartṛtvamucyate tathā sama ka bhidhānāhate tadviśeṣasaṃkhyābhidhānaṃ draṣṭavyam /	Thus then, it being absolutely necessary to assume a cer tain unreasonable fact, it would be far better to assume that la is the conventional technical name for the Nominative and the Objective because what should be admitted as denotative of something with which it is invariably concomitant for while in the condition of mere la it could not denote anything, unless such denotativeness were conventionally and technically attributed to it. And thus when we come to consider the question, as to whether the attributing of the particular signification to the letter la, by the sūtra ‘luḥ karmani, etc., is done through the substitutes tip, etc., for the sake of ordinary parlance and the Veda, or only for the sake of certain technical uses to which the name might be put in the grammatical works themselves, we find that we can accept it as being for the sake of ordinary parlance and the Veda, only if it could be shown, by proper reasoning, that even in such parlance and the Veda, the Nominative and the Objective are actually denoted by the Verbal Affixes and if this cannot be shown, then it must be regarded as being meant only as a technical nomenclature adopted for use in gram matical works alone. We have already shown above that the name in question does not serve any purpose in connection with ordinary parlance and the Veda and hence it must be admitted that it is only meant for use in grammatical works.
yadapi gamyamānasya viśeṣaṇasaṃbandho nāstyatastatsambandhadarśanādabhidhānamiti tadapyākṛtyaruṇādhikaraṇayorubhayathā pi darśanānnirākṛtam /	For instance, unless the Nominative and the Objective were accepted as to be denoted by the term la, we could not have the preclusion of the caseendings relating to these, by means of the conditional sutra anubhihitē. Thus then, even though the Nominative and the Objective are not actually denoted by the Verbal Affix, yet, inasmuch as in grammar itself, they are technically admitted to be so denoted, the caseendings, whose appearance is conditioned by the Nominative and the Objective being ‘not expressed, could not come in. And thus we have shown that there is no chance of the appearance of other Kārakaaffixes .e.
api ca madhuro rasaḥ snigdhaḥ śoto guruścetyanenā nai kāntikatvam /	But this reasoning is found to be too wide, in view of such words as çinçapa and the like.

In this sentence we find that the sweet taste being a property, and as such incapable of being related to other properties of snigdha soft and the rest,it is the sweet object indicated by the words Madhuro rasak that is regarded ne related to these properties and certainly the word rasah can never W denote the substance directly.
tathā 'khasahasreṇa nagaraṃ muṣitāmati gamyamānānāmeva sādināṃ moṣakriyāsaṃbandhaḥ /	Similarly, too, we often come across such sentences as Açvasahasrenu nagaram mushitam The city was sacked by a thousand horses, wherein what are connected with the action. of sacking are not the horses, but the riders indicated by the word horse.
yatta va ciḍūmādī rūpādau vā na dṛśyate na tāvatā sarvatra sthitiḥ kalpayituṃ śakyate /	The mere fact, of a certain particular indicated object not being connected with qualifications, as in the case of Smoke, or in that of Colour, cannot justify the assertion that such would be the case every.. where.
tasmānnābhidheyaḥ karttā tatantravārtike /	For these reasons, we conclude that the Nominative is not directly denoted by the Verbal Affix.
taśca śrautatvābhāvāntra prakaraṇaṃ vādhyate / yattu karmadharmapakṣe darśapūrṇamāsa vidhinaiva vihitatvāt prātyātmiko vidhiranardhakaḥ syāt tasmātpuruṣārthateti tatra brūmaḥ /	And thus, inasmuch as in the sentence nanṛtam vadet the Nomi native would not be directly denoted by the Verb, the connection of the Human Agent with the telling of lies would not be directly expressed by the sentence and as such there would be no Direct Declaration to set aside the indications of the Context, to the effect that the Prohibition of telling lies pertains to the Sacrificethe DarçaPurnamāsa. There has been another argument to the effect that if the Prohibi tion contained in the sentence pertained to the sacrifice, then, inasmuch as it would have been laid down by means of the one Collective Injane tion of the DarçaPurmanāsa, a separate Injunction for its sake in the shape of the sentence nanṛtum vadet would be wholly useless.
vinā ca tena dhātvartho na kratvaṅgaṃ pratīyate	for it and in the absence of such use, the Rootmeaning of the word vadēt would not be recognized as belonging to the sacrifice.
vidhau punarasya yājurvedikatvāt bhraṣasya yajurvedato yajño vinaṣṭa ityanvāhāryapacane bhuvaḥ gvāheti hotavyam / smṛtestvanyataramūlatvānavadhāraṇād na vedabhreṣanimittaprāyaścitāvadhāraṇaṃ syāt /	That is to say, a Rootmeaning, devoid of the Injunction, becomes itself the object to be accomplished and thus, not being of any use to any other result such as the Apurva of a sacrifice, it could not be taken up by the Procedure of the DarçaPurnamasa and not being taken up by this, it could not be included in the Collective Injunction of those sacrifices. Thus then, it must be admitted that the distinct Injunction serves, in the first instance, to point out, either directly or indirectly, the fact of the Prohibition being of use to the human agent and then, having recourse to the instrumentality of that which is denoted by the verbal Root, and thus standing in need of something apart from that, as the object to be accomplished, it comes to be recognized as related to the DarçaPurnamāsa sacrifices, which are mentioned in close proximity to the sentence in question, and as subsidiary to these.
evaṃ mūlamūlibhāvābhyupagame 'pi smṛtyaiva tadarthastadatikramañcānusṛta iti tadīyameva prāyaścittam /	Aud thus we find that the Injunction of the subsidiary Prohibition of telling lies serves a distinctly useful purpose. Thus then, the various factors of the Injunction nanṛtam vadet come to mean as follows The word vadet means that a certain help should be accorded to the DarçaPurnamasa sacrifices by means of telling or speaking.
nanu tavāpi yājurvedikatvātjñānāttadvedaprāyaścittameva bhavet / naitadasti /	The force of the word anṛta implies that which is to be done by speaking should be done by false speaking? The presence of the negative na signifies that the help should be accorded by false speaking is not..
etaḍyāhavanīyādiviṣayatvādāhitāgtyadhikāramavalambate 'nṛtapratiṣedhaśca puruṣamāvatrarmatvādanāhitāgnerapyavasthitaḥ /	And thus we find that the sense of the sentence as a whole turns out to be the Prohibition of that falsity that is possible in the talking as done for the sake of the DarçaPurnamasa and this leads us to the general rule We should avoid falsity in all the talking that is done for the sake of the sacri fices.

Reply If the sentence were merely descriptive of what has been laid down in the Smrti, then the Expiatory Rite would be that which is laid down in the Smrtis while if it be Injunctive, then, inasmuch as it would be an Injunction contained in the Yajurveda, the Expiatory Rite attendant upon its infringement would be one that is laid down in that Veda.
ayajñāṅgavināśe tu na tasyāvasarī bhavet	As for the Smrti, since we would not know in which particular Veda it may have its origin, there would be no certainty as to the Veda, in accordance with which the Expiatory Rite should be performed.

And when this would be found out,inasmuch as the occasion for the Rite would be the same, in the case of one who has performed the Agnihotra, as well as one who has not performed it, the former also would perform the Rite that is laid down in the Smrti so that there would be no performance of that expiatory rite which is laid down in the Veda.
tahadeva ca yajamānaviṭaḍāvapi tantreṇa prayoga iti na kaściḍiśeṣo dṛśyate /	And further, in the case of sacrifices, the Veda lays down distinct expiatory rites to be performed for discrepancy in any of the details of the sacrifice and hence when there would be no discrepancy in any of the sacrificial details, there would be no occasion for those rites. That is to say, in all such sentences as yadrkto yajña ärtimiyat, etc., we find that certain discrepancies in connection with the Sacrifice are laid down as occasions for Expiatory Rites.

And hence, just as when the Yajamāna has once conveyed by words the offering of the Barleycake, he should not offer, in deed, that of the Vrihi corn,, in the same manner, when the Adhvaryu and other Priests have once determined upon a certa This is in course. of action, they should not stultify themselves by actually taking up another course, for the sake of case and comfort,etc. Even in regard to those few actions that are done for the purification of the human agent, the lying would be eschewed, on the ground of those actions also form ing part of the Sacrifice.

śrutyaiva ca pratiṣedhaḥ prāptyā saṃbandhaḥ sa yatna prāptistatva khasāmadhyena gacchan na śakyate samākhyayā vārayitum /	We find that the Prohibition, expressed by Direct declaration, is connected with such condi tions under which there may be a chance of what is prohibited being present and as such it would betake itself to all such places, by its inherent capability and in this it could not be stopped by the very much inferior authority of the Name Adhvaryava.
nanu vadedityetāvaddidhyāṃśamātramālocyamānaṃ samākhyā niyaṃsyati tataśca pratiṣedho 'pi tadanusāritvānniyato bhaviṣyati /	Objection The Name could certainly restrict the Injunctive element in the sentence vudet and then, inasmuch as the Prohibition also would follow in the wake of that Injunction, the latter too would DA be red by that Name.
naitadevam / paryavasite hi śāstrārthe tatkarttarapekṣāyāṃ satyāṃ samākhyā vatarati / na ca vadedityetāvataḥ śāstrārthatvaṃ vijñāyate /	Reply It is not so because it is only when the meaning of the whole scriptural sentence has been completed, that there arises the question as to by whom is to be performed that which the sentence has laid down and it is only after this that the use of the Name comes in as indicating the performer. Thus then, inasmuch as telling is merely referred to, it cannot be taken as qualified by the Name while as for the Prohibition, that cannot be specified as belonging to any particular person. Thus the conclusion is that the present discussion serves useful pur poses in all cases and as such, there can be no doubt that we did right in taking up this inquiry.
pra tiṣedhasaṃvandhādi tadanuvādatvena sthitam /	But out of these we picked out, in the foregoing Adhikarana, only three, as being more reasonable than the rest.
na cānūdyamānasya śrutamapi viśeṣaṇaṃ bhavatīti grahādhikaraṇe sādhitam /	inasmuch as the term signifies that which is easy of approach, it serves to preclude all places that are difficult to be got at and by this, they help the human agent, and not the sacrifice.
kisuta mamākhyayā vidhīyamānapadārthakartaviśeṣasaṃbandhamāla eka vyāpriyate /	As for the Smrti rule regarding the fact of the Bath always preceding the Breakfast, that too pertains to the Agent alone, and makes the transcendental result following from that restriction, betake itself to him.
tasmādandyamānatvāidanaṃ na viśeṣyate /	Thus then, the specification of “Tirtha also, being connected with the Bath, whose use has been definitely ascertained, comes to be regarded as pertaining to the human agent.
pratiṣedho 'pi tadgāmau viśeṣṭuṃ naiva śakyate	And the mantra being mentioned in the same sentence with it, as connected with the person thus pointed out,it could not be taken up by the Context.

Sutra But from the peculiarity of the Context, they would constitute the purification of one con nected with it, like the substance.

Because, so long as it is possible for two means of knowledge to be econciled, it is not proper to have one set aside by the other.

In the case in question, we find that if the Actions in question are connected with the human agent only, the indications of the Context are set aside without any reason. Objection The acceptance of the other alternative theory would also mean the rejection of Indicative Power and Syntactical Connection.
tathā yadyapi brayādityanana karttā nopāttastathā'pi jañjayamānaśabdaḥ kṛdannatvātkarttari kṛditi cānatyaparassāra puruṣasaṃyuktasyeti ka pu pā /	Reply True, these latter would be rejected, only if we connected the actions with something other than the human agent. As a matter of fact, however, it is with the Agent as engaged in a sacrifice, that we hold the actions to be connected and in this not a single means of knowledge is rejected. For if the yawning person, as well as the bathing person, were taken as that indicated by the Context,that would not be incom patible, either with the sense of all the words of the two sentences as pointed out by Syntactical Connection, or with the capability of things as indicated by Indicative Power.

Reply The idea of the unspecified person cannot but be set aside. even by you because the ignorant and the incapable persons could not be entitled to the actions in question and so you cannot take all men to be connected with the actions.
tasmātpuruṣamātradharmā evaṃjātīyakā iti / prakaraṇaviśeṣādā tayuktasya saṃ skāro dravyavat	Objection In the way that you suggest, the Context would come to be taken as the means of the necessary specification. Reply It is not so because in this case also, the Context remains only a comprehender and it could not become the means of specifying the yawning person that forms the subject of the sentence.

That is to say, the Vrihi corn, connected with the Prokshana, is not thereby specialised by the Context but what happens is that in order to save it from becoming useless, and ou account of there being no reason for assuming an imperceptible result, and lastly, because as an auxiliary to the sacrifice, it has to serve a distinct purpose, we accept the Vrihi mentioned in the Context to be the one to which the Prokshana is to be applied.
tathā 'tra phalakalpanābhavātpratyāsattyanurodhena prākaraṇikana abhyamānagrahaṇaṃ kriyate /	And in the same manner, in order to avoid the assumption of a distinct result, and in consideration of proximity, we take that yawning person who is connected with the Context.
na hi tatsambhave 'nyaphalakalpanāpramāgāṃ labhyate /	And so long as this is pos sible, there can be no grounds for the assumption of any other result.
nanu ca klṛptamevānayoḥ phalamityuktam / satyamuktaṃ na tvaudṛśa na śabdena phalamucyate kāmaśabdopabandhābhāvāt /	Objection The result of the two actions in question is already definitely ascertained, and has not got to be assumed, as we have already explained above. Reply It is true that you have explained it but the result is never found to be mentioned by such words as are found in the sentences in question as their mention is always found to be accompanied by the word Kama desire.
etadeva ca nāva vidhāyakaṃ śabdamupalabhāmahe ityāha / phalavidhānaṃ haudṛśana śabdena na kriyataiti vakṣyāmaḥ / itarathā punarbrūyādityavāpyastyeva vidhivibhaktirityayukta meva vidhāyakābhāvavacanam /	This is what is meant by the assertion we do not find any injunctive word here the sense of this assertion must be taken as such words cannot serve the purpose of enjoining the results,as we shall explain later on. Otherwise, inasmuch as we have an actual Injunc tive word in the shape of bruyat, it would not be quite true to assert the absence of the Injunctive word.
na hi dhattaityetasyāvidhāyakatvādapālambho bhavati /	Nor can the opponent be taunted with the fact of the word dhattē not being injunctive.
sarvacaiva phalāṃśasyāvidheyatvāt /	Because in all cases, the factor of Result never forms the object of Injunction.
tasmādyayoktameva yojanīyam /	Consequently the said sentence must be taken in the manner just shown.
dravyasaṃskāra karmasvityanena cārthavādatvaṃ vacyate / phalaṃ tu tatpradhānāyāmiti ca kāmapadopatradāyāṃ tadarthatvam /	Specially as we shall show under Sutra IViii, that such sentences are Arthavadas and under Sutra IViii, that the mention of the Result is only by means of such sentences as contain the word Kāma Desire. Objection We might accept the actions to be purificatory of the human agent.

But we do not accept it to belong to only that person who is performing the DarçaPūrṇamāsa sacrifices. That is to say, the repetition of the Mantra mayi dakshakratu, etc., being recog uised as belonging to the yawning person, would be precluded from being of no use in ordinary life.
darśapūrṇamāsāveva kurvata ityetanneti kā 'bhiprāya /	But the person who would be yawn.

Con sequently we take the Mantra as pertaining to the human agent engaged in any sacrifice.

yastu jyotiṣṭomādau nañjabhyamānaḥ sa dārśapūrṇamāsikavadeva saprayojana ityaśakyo varjayitumityataḥ kratumātrayuktapuruṣadharmo bhavati /	Because, just as the Nivita has been found to have no connection with the duties of attending upon guests, etc., simply because of its not being mentioned by Direct Declaration,etc. as related to those duties,so, in the same manner, the repetition of the Mantra in question would, for the same reason, have no relationship with the other sacrifices.

As a matter of fact, it cannot be so precluded as the Injunctions that have once operated can never be precluded by anything and in all cases of preclusion, the preclusion is recognised from the very beginning and this preclusion is made in the following manner Inas much as, in accordance with Adhikaraṇa Dravyasankhyāhëtusamudāyanca. VIi, the mention of the mere form of the yawning person would be useless,the word janjabhya mana yawning should be taken as indicating the means to a certain Apūrva and as a matter of fact, we find that this Indication would not be possible except through the Context and as for the Context, we have no other available save that pertaining to the Apurva of the DarçaPurnamāsa.
tasmāt prātyātmikānāmanuvādatvama / atrābhidhīyate /	Consequently, it must be ad mitted that the purification, involved in the repetition of the Mantra, pertains to that yawning person who is engaged in the bringing about of the DarçaPürnamāsaApūrva.

Objection The objection of the opponent is that what the Bhashya has here dealt with is exactly the same as that dealt with in the preced ing Adhikarana, but the replies given on the two occasions are mutually contradictory. For instance, on the former occasion, the explanation given was that it is only when a certain action has become subsidiary to another, that it comes to be taken up by the Collective Injunction of the latter Action and until the former action has been enjoined, it does not become subsidiary to any other action while on the present occa sion it is held that the sentence would not be an Injunction, but a mere Descriptive Declaration.
atha cānuvādaḥ kathaṃ parveṇa vidhināṅgatvaṃ prakalpya prayogavacanaṃ yāvannīyate tāvantaṃ ca kālamasau vidhiṇāvatiṣṭhate /	And in view of the contradictory character of these two explanations vouchsafed by the Bhishya, we must consider which of these two is true and which is false. In view of what has been said on the previous occasion, it would seem that the former was the correct explanation while the latter is put forth simply by way of admitting the opponents position for the sake of argument.
prayogavacanagrahaṇe tu satitadaṅgatāsaṃsparśādeva puruṣapravṛttisidderanuvādatvam /	That is to say, under the Sutra Xviii, it will be shown that, on account of all subsidiaries tending to fulfil a single purpose, there is a single collective Inj unction of all these and this could be possible for only those that are laid down in the Collective Injanction because each of the distinct Injunctions of these sub sidiaries operates separately. An Injunction is that by which a man is .
ataḥ prāk prayogavacanasamarpaṇāddidhiravena vinā na vyavahāraḥ sidhyatīti vidhiḥ / uttarakāle tu tata eva pravṛttisiddheranuvāda iti ubhayamapi sādhūktam /	Consequently, the distinct Injunctions must be regarded as mere descriptive declarations. To the above we make the following reply Both portions of the Bhashya are quite correct. Because the declaration contained in the former is not wrong, for the reason that is given thereinviz., that until an Action is enjoined, it cannot be subsidiary to another Action, specially as it has been already explained that if we do not admit the Injunction, only that which is signified by the Verbal Root would come to be the object to be accomplished and as this would not serve any useful purpose, it could not be taken as subsidiary to any other Action consequently the sentence in question must be admitted to be an Injunction.
vyapadeśādapakṛṣyeta	It may also be taken as a mere descriptive declaration.
prakaraṇa honasyātyantamavidyamānatvā ḍākyasaṃyuktaddā tadbhutavidhisaṃsparśādeveti ka pu pā /	Thus then, we find that, inasmuch as, prior to being taken up by the Collective Injunction, its per formance would not be possible, the sentence laying it down as a distinct sacrifice, is taken as an Injunction while subsequent to that, as its per formance comes to be accomplished, through the Collective Injunction of the Action to which it is the snbsidiary, the former Injunction comes to be taken as a mere Descriptive Declaration.
daśopasattvaṃ prakaraṇenāgṛhyamāṇamutkṛṣyata ityadṛṣṭānta /	Sūtra It could be taken apart from the Context, only through the mention of a particular charac ter. In the case of the Ahina, we found that, it has no existence at all, in the Context and hence the mention of twelveupasads in the sentence, not being taken up by the Context, had to be taken apart from the Context.
śaṃyau ca sarvaparidānāt	. Sutra In the case of the Camyu we would have to take it apart from the Context because of the protect tion having been extended to all.
śaṃthāviti brāhmaṇāvagoraṇādipratiṣedhavākyopalakṣagām /	The word Çamyu is the name given to all such prohibitions as those pertaining to the Threatening of a Brāhmaṇa, the striking of him and the shedding of his blood In connection with this also we have the same alternative theories as in the previous Adhikarana.
tatra pūrvavadeva pakṣāḥ teṣāmapi prākaraṇikaṃ saṃbandhaiyamadhyekīkṛtya nirdaṣṭaṃ kratudharmaḥ śuddhapuruṣadharmaśceti hāveva pacau /	But from among these, we pick out only two, taking the two connections into one and these two alternatives are these Prohibitions pertain to the sacrifice, or to the Man only. In accordance with all that has been said with regard to the Prohi bition of Telling Lies, the Prohibitions in question must be taken as pertaining to such Threatening,etc. as are possible for the sake of the sacrifice.
samastena cānnṛtavadanapratiṣedhanyāyena kratvarthasyāvagoraṇasya pramajyamānasya pratiṣedhaḥ /	Nor can the Prohibition in question be held to pertain to that Man who is connected with the Context because what the sentence speaks of is not a purificatory action, but only a Prohi bition calculated to save man from falling into hell.

Though the Bhashya has explained the word yatayat as Injunctive, yet that cannot be quite relevant because the result spoken of is not meant to be enjoined.
na karttavyaṃ tena tadyatirekopāyāntarāśrayaṇaṃ kāryamityuktaṃ bhavati tathā prāpte'bhidhīyate /	That which is desirable is not enjoined while that which is not desirable can never call forth the activity of Man and as such the introduction of the Injunctive is wholly contrary to the nature of this latter. Consequently all that we can rightly assert is that the Prohibition is accomplished by the mere mention of the undesirable result, that the undesirable result pertains to the Man,aud hence the Prohibition must also pertain to the Man and not to the sacrifice. .
vākyena sarvasaṃyogātsarvebhyo varadānataḥ / phalasya kalpitatvācca neṭa prakaraṇagrahaḥ	Though the latter sentenco occurs in a different placo, yet it has been quoted by the Bhashya along with the former, because it is to be utilised in the next Sutra, by way of showing that it is for another purpose, malavadvāsā is the woman in her courses and in regard to the Prohibition of conversing with her, we have three alternative theories . .
tāmaparudhya yajeteti hi sāmānyataḥ sarvammādeva kratvanuṣṭhānādasau nirvārttitā kathaṃ saṃvāde prasajyeta / puruṣasya tu svātantryātsarvakālasaṃvāde prāpte niṣedhasyārthavattā /	be impure on the day of the sacrifice, should perform the sacrifice, after removing her from there, there would be no possibility of any convers ing with the woman in course of the sacrifice. Because, in accordance with the sentence just quoted, she having been moved away from all sacri ficial performances, how could there be any chance for the yajamana con versing with that woman, in course of the sacrifice? As for the Man in general, on the other hand, inasmuch as his ways would be independent of all such restrictions as pertain to sacrifices, there is every possibility of his conversing with the woman and in reference to him, the Prohibi tion would serve a distinctly useful purpose.
yadi ca smṛtirevamarthā vidyate tato mūlamūlibhāva evābhyupagantavyaḥ na hi kena cinnityānuvādatvamuktam /	Even if we have Smrtirules prohibiting the said conversing, we could take those as having their source in the sentence under considera tion and neither of them should be taken as a mere descriptive declara tion.
annapratiṣedhāca	p. Sutra Also because of the prohibition of inter course.

yatastu vedenaiva prakaraṇāprakaraṇāmnānavivekaḥ kṛtaḥ tato 'vagamyate nūnaṃ prakaraṇādhītānāṃ puruṣadharmatvamiti /	But inasmuch as the Veda itself makes a distinction between a thing being mentioned and not being mentioned in a particular Context, we conclude that those things that are not mentioned in any particular Context, must pertain to the Man in general.
adravyatvāttu śeṣaḥ syāt	Sutra Objection Objection Not having a substance, it would be subsidiary to the sacrifice.
yadyapi tāvaddiśiṣṭavidhānaṃ tathā 'pi karmaśeṣa eva syādanyathā hi phalaṃ kalpyeta /	Says the opponent Even if the sentence in question be a quali fied Injunction, it could not but be subsidiary to the sacrifice otherwise it would be necessary to assume a distinct result in connection with the Injunction in question.
nanu kratusaṃbandho 'pi ka lpayitavya eva /	Objection Its connection with the sacrifice too will have to be assumed.
satyaṃ pramāṇavato hi tatkalpanā /	Reply True but this latter assumption would be fully authorised.

What we mean is thisNo other action, save Yāga, Dāna and Homa, can ever be the principal action and in the case in question we find none of these three actions, as the sentence does not contain any. word expressive of the Recipient of the offering, gift,etc. and thus by its very nature the action of wearing would be a subsidiary, and that too to another action. Or, it may be that the sentence mentions the wearing, and this action, by its very nature, is subsidiary to that which is worn.
ata śrītpattikenāṅgatvena karmaśeṣatvam /	And thus we find that it is this Injunction that forms the basis of the definition of Hiranya, that is given in the Kalpasutras, as that gold which bears its natural excellent colour.
atha vā dhāraṇa metat śrūyate taccotpattyaiva ghāryamāṇaśeṣabhūtam /	Otherwise if the defini tion Hiranyam jatarupam pratiyat were not explained as above, but only as that which bears its natural excellent colour , inasmuch as the these metals retain their natural excellent colour, it would be neces sary to look out for another authority for applying the word to any one of the two only..
na ca laukikasya niṣprayojanatvātsaṃskārārhatvam /	Though the Bhashya has mentioned the Deity also along with Substance in the course of his explanation of the expression adravyat vät, yet, inasmuch as it is something wholly unconnected with the Sutra, and hence most improper.
ataḥ karmāṅgabhṛtayorvāsohiraṇyayorvidhiḥ /	Specially as we have other actions “also,in the shape of Japa and the like, which are neither Yaga, nor “Dāna, nor Homa, and yet which are performed as principal actions and hence there is no use of mentioning the Deity.
atha vā tata evānekārthavidhidoṣātsati ca saṃbhave balādguṇe vidhiśaktisaṃcāragājiraṇyadhāraṇaṃ hiraṇyaṃ hastena bhavati atha gṛhṇāti hiraṇya haste saṃpradāya ṣoḍaśinā stuvataityevamādivākyavihitamandā suvargātā vidhīyate vāsaḥ paridhattaiti caitahihite vāsasi śobhanatvam /	If the sentence be taken as laying down excellence of colour with reference to the Gold, then, too, the said Name would be wholly inoperative because that excellence of colour would be uuder the influence of certain other Injunctions, and it would not be of the nature of actions. The word Vedasamyoga in the Satra means the fact of both being equally Vedic and hence, if some one were to argue that there is a possibility of the wearing of the Gold and the Cloth in ordinary life also, and hence the Injunction of the property excellence of colour could be taken as referring to the wearing met with in ordinary life, this argument too would be met by the said reason of Vedasamyoga. Sūtra Because the substance is the principal factor in the sentence.” On the former occasion Text, page , it has been said that the Wearing is naturally possessed of the character of a purificatory action and now we proceed to show additional reasons for the same opinion Because of the mention of the Objective character. Inasmuch as we find the word hiranyam with the Accusative Ending am, and as the Bhashya speaks of the presence of the Objective, the Accusative Ending in hiranyam might be mistaken to be similar to that in the word orihin. native, the former being expressed by the nyat affix in bhāryam this is what is meant by the expression dravyaparatvat.
evaṃ ca sūtrakārāṇāṃ hi ragayamiti jātahṛpaṃ pratīyādityādiparibhāṣaṇasyaitadeva mūlam /	That too is the reason why the Bhashya has spoken of the connection of the sense of the Ob jective, and not the connection of the Objective. Thus then the wearing, being of the nature of a purificatory act, must be taken as subsidiary to the sacrifice.. Sutra Reply But there would be a connection with the Result just as in the case of the presence of words to that effect and hence it is an Action, as declared by Aiticayana.
anyathā rajatajātarūpasādhāro sati hiraṇyaśabde 'nyatarāvadhāraṇamūlamanyat kalpyaṃ syāt / adravyatvāditi ca nāva dravyaṃ vidhīyate kiṃ tarhi taviśeṣamātravidhānametat ataśca yaca dravyaṃ tavānena gantavyamiti /	Because every sentence, that is not found to be mentioned in any particular Context, lays down a sub sidiary, either by means of the connection of a sentence, or by that of an invariably concomitant Indicative Power. In the case in question, however, we find that there is no connection of any sentence nor is there any such Indicative Power as is required because the wearing of gold is common to both ordinary life and the Veda. That wearing could have been specialised by the declaration of its performability but if that declaration be taken as serving the purposes of the said qualification, all its potency being spent up in that qualification, it would cease to be injunctive. Consequently all that has the support of authority, is the mere relationship of the substance in question i.e.
yattvatra bhāṣyakāreṇa devatāgrahaṇaṃ kṛtam /	As for the appearance of Heaven and the like, inasmuch asat would be an action, and based elsewhere in the case of the DarçaPurnamāsa f.i.
tadutsūtvamayuktaṃ ca pradhānaṃ hi japādyapi	upon the Veda,both the sentences would be equally capable of pointing to that appearance and hence there remains no chance for these sen tences pointing to any particular sacrifice.
homāstu vyavatiṣṭherannāhavanīyasaṃyogāt	Nor would they abandon the modi fications for fear of there being needless repetition. Specially in the case of Agriculture,etc. Sutra Being Homas, they would be restricted in their performance because of the connection of the Ahavaniya Fire.
yaśca vyavatiṣṭherannete homā vaidekeṣveva na sarvatra bhaveyuḥ / kutaḥ/ samānadeśatā nityamiṣyate 'ṅgapradhānayoḥ /	even if we were to carry the Fire to the field all that we would have would be a certain degree of proximity between the two, and there would not be any identity of their positions specially as it is not possible for the Fire to be taken to every furrow, and the Homa performed there. In fact, even if this were possible, it would not constitute an identity of position between the Homa and the Ploughing,etc. The expression homästu in the Sutra contains a reason, the sense being, because they are Homas, they would be restricted in their performance.
na ca kṛṣyādibhiḥ sākrameṣāṃ syāt tulyadeśatā	And if an Adhvaryu priest were appointed independently, for performing the Jaya, then, in that case, this latter would not be performed by the same person as the Agricultural Operations as these latter are not per formed by the Adhvaryu priest. .
varuṇo vā evaṃ gṛhṇāti yo 'śvaṃ pratigṛhṇātīti pāpena grahaṇaṃ yasmintraśvapratigṛhe sa nimittaṃ pratīyate ta dapi ca pāpagṛhaṇaṃ prāptamanadyate /	The Ishti would be performed at the acceptance of the ordinary Horsegift. Because the acceptance that is declared to be the cause of the Ishti is that which is sinful and as a matter of fact we find that sinfulness attaches only to the acceptance of the ordinary Horsegift in the case of the Vedic Horsegift, on the other hand, we do not recognise any sinfulness, as it is laid down in the Veda and as such, cannot be sinful. That is to say, the sentence Varuno va êtam pratigrhnati yoçvam pratigrhuati distinctly shows that the prompting cause of the Ishti is that acceptance of the Horsegift which is sinful and it is this sinfulness that is referred to in the sentence.
yadi hi vidhīyate tataḥ kadā cidetaddākyasāmarthyādeva vaidike'pi syāt /	If this sinfulness were enjoined in this sentence, then, perhaps, it could, on the strength of this sentence, be taken as applying to the acceptance of the Vedic Horsegift also.
na ca tatra karmavidhānaṃ vidheyasya karmaṇa pāpaphalatvāsaṃbhavāt /	As it is, however, it is not enjoined, as no results of actions and sinfulness is such a result can form the object of Injunction. Nor does the son tence contain the Injunction of an action as an action that would be enjoined could never result in anything sinful.
na cehāśvapratigṛha pratiṣidhyate tadaśravaṇāt /	Nor does the sentence prohibit the acceptance of the Horsegift as we do not find any mention in it of that acceptance and also because it serves the only purpose of pointing out the prompting cause of the Ishti.
tammādatyanta saṃbandhād yatva pratiṣedhastava doṣaḥ /	Thus then, inasmuch as there is an absolute relationship been Sinfulness and Prohibition, the sinfulness must be admitted only where there is Prohibition. Theu as. a matter of fact, we find that the Prohibition that we have is of the acceptance of the ordinary Horsegift, e.g.
sa ca laukikasya pratiṣedho na kesariṇo dadāti nobhayatodataḥ pratigṛhṇātauti /	in the sentences no horses are to be given, no such animals are to be received in gift as have two rows of teeth, Objection The Prohibition in these sentences is found to be, applying in common to both kinds of Horsegift, the ordinary as well the Vedic. as Reply True, it appears to be so and it is for this very reason that we take it as pertaining to the ordinary Horsegift because the Vedic one forms the subject of another distinct Injunction and as such it could not form the subject of a Prohibition.
nanvayamapi pra tiṣedhaḥ sāmānyenaiva śrayate /	Objection If such be the case, then, inasmuch as the Acceptance would only be for the sake of a certain end desirable by Man, the Mantra,etc. also in connection therewith would come to be the same.
itarasya viśeṣavidhisaṃsṣṭaṣṭasya pratiṣedha viṣayatvāsaṃbhavāt /	As regards the acceptance of the gift of the Horse however, inasmuch as we have a distinct prohibition of it, if one should be found willing to disobey the Prohibition and accept the gift of the horse,him alone should the sacrificer appoint as the Priest to officiate at the sacrifice in which the sacrificial gift consists of the Horse.
nanu ca nimittabhāvāduddiśyamāno 'khaprātagaho na doṣeṇa viśeṣṭuṃ śakyataiti vidhīyamāneṣṭistutimātrapare doṣasaṃkīrttane vaidiko 'pi nimittaṃ bha vet /	But it cannot be believed that such officiating is enjoined by the Apparent Inconsistency of the former Injunction of the Açvamēdha. In the same manner, in the case in question also, we cannot admit of there being any Injunction for the acceptance of the Horsegift. Thus then, inasmuch as the sinfulness attaching to the acceptance would be present as much in case of the ordinary Horsegift, as in that of the Vedic one, the sinfulness could not be taken as specifying the occasion.
uvyate /	for the performance of the Ishti.
yadi vaidike dāturiṣṭiriti kṛtvā satyapyapratigādyāthājyayājananimitte pratigṛhītṛṇāṃ pāpe doṣarahitanimittamucyate /	There is yet another explanation of the Bhashya passage in question it is as follows In the case of the ordinary Horsegift, the Ishti would be performed by the Receiver while in that of the Vedic one, it would be performed by the Giver as in this latter, it forms part of the sacrifice that is being performed by the latter but as for the acceptance, it is sinful in both cases as in the former, it is actually prohibited, and in the latter also it is not distinctly allowed or enjoined. But as for the giving, it is actually enjoined in the case of the latter.
tato laukike 'pi śūdrādibhya upādāne davyatyapi pratigrahītari dātustadvāreṇāduṣṭatvāddoṣarahitameva nimittam /	Or again, it may be that in both cases, the Ishti is performed by the Giver. Then as for the giving, we find that this, in ordinary life, is distinctly prohibited, as will be shown under the Dakshinadhikaraṇa, where we find the declaration Horses would have been very useful, if their giving and acceptance were not both prohibited and in connection with the Vigvajit sacrifice, when one is said to give away all his property, the Horse is not given, simply because its giving is prohibited.
atha vaidike dāturlaukike pratīgṛhīturiṣṭiriti kalpyate tatrāpyupapattiviśeṣo vaktavyaḥ /	In the case of the Paundarika sacrifice however, we find it distinctly laid down that the sacrificial gift should consist of a thousand horses, and in connection with the Joytishtoma also, the giving of one horse is laid down as necessary and hence as regards these two particular cases, the general Prohibition is set aside by these particular Injunctions and hence such giving is not considered sinful.
yo 'śvapratigṛhādeva doṣaḥ so 'va pratīyate / dāḍhadoṣastu sarvatra tulyo 'śvairna viśeṣyate	And hence we conclude that the Ishti has to be performed only by one who, in ordinary life, makes a gift of the horse, in the way of a friendly present and the like and also by one who sells the horse as in the case of selling also, we have the ele ment of renouncing ones own ownership and creating that of another and as such it fulfills all the conditions of the denotation of the Verb to give.
yadi pratigraho na vidhoyeta kathaṃ tasyetikarttavyatā vidhīyeta / kimiti vā tasminnakṛte karmavaiguṇyaṃ syāt /	Nor do we accept that alone as gift which is given for the sake of an imperceptible result because it is after the character of the gift has been established, that we come to ascertain whether it leads to a perceptible or an imperceptible result. Though the gift that brings about a perceptible result in the shape of the money that he receives for the thing sold is spoken of by means of the word selling and not gift, yet there would be nothing incongruous in the two words selling and gift, of which the former is only a particular form of the latter, applying to the same action of selling.
atra vadāmaḥ / ṛtviggdho dakṣiṇāṃ dadyāditi dānaṃ vidhīyate /	In ordinary experience also, we find that when a man has sold paddy, he says, I have given away the paddy, and he who has bought it, says, I have taken the paddy and hence the selling also is a gift and as such the selling also of the horse would constitute the prompting cause of the Ishti.
yaścātra doṣa upātto nāsau laukikasya satyapi pratiṣiddhatve kutaścitpramāṇadgamyate jalodaraṃ hyatra varu gagahaṇarūpeṇāpāttam /	Objection Inasmuch as we find the horse mentioned among the things that should be given as sacrificial gifts, such for instance as Cloth, Horse, Land, etc., etc., we cannot believe the giving of the Horse to be sinful. Reply The giving of the Horse would not be sinful, in a case where it is laid down as the object to be given.
naca kasyāñcidvaidya kasaṃhitāyāṃ laukiko śivapratigraho nidānaṃ śrūyate nāpi pratyakṣānumānādibhigamyate / na ca vākye na kesariṇo dadāti nobhayatodataḥ pratigṛhṇatoti śrūyate /	In the sentence that you speak of, we have only an enumeration of the things to be given, and not an actual Injunction of the giving away of those things. Thus then, inasmuch as the enumeration stands in need of the Injunction of giving away, we must conclude that the said declaration of the Horse as an object of gift pertains to that action in connection with which the Horse is specially enjoined as to be given away, while for the Cow and other things, that are not prohibited even in a general way, they might be admitted as gifts even in those cases where what is laid down is the mere giving in general. Sutra It is an Arthavada because we do not acceptance of the Horsegift consequently, the Ishti should be taken as to be performed in connection with a sacrifice.
nāpyetasya vā kyasya tatpratipattau vyāpāro vidyamānānuvādena tatra nirghātārthakarmavidhimālaparatvāt /	As a matter of fact, however, it is not meant to serve that purpose. Because it is only when a certain evil effect has been cognised by some other means that a certain action can be held to be meant for the purpose of removing that effect in the case in question, however, we find that the evil effect that is here spoken of does not exist.
yastu doṣaḥ pratiṣedhavākyānnarakapātātmakaḥ kalpitaḥ sa iha nopātantravārtike / to varuṇo vāetaṃ gṛhṇātītyanenābhidhātumaśakyatvāt /	As for the evil effectin the shape of fall into hell that is assumed on the strength of the said Prohibition it is not what is spoken of in the sentence in question because the sentence, which is in the formVaruno va etam grhnatican never express the fall into hell. S c If all evil effects be spoken of as Varunathat which covers vrnoti and hence an attack of this were spoken of as the effect of the acceptance of the Horsegift,then, in that case, we would be aban doning the wellknown fact of the expression Varunagrhita meaning.
yā tvavayavaprasiḍiḥ sā vaidike'pi tyāge duḥkhadarśanāt /	an attack of Dropsy.
pratigrahe ca rakṣaṇapoṣaṇādinā kleśātkiṃciharuṇātmakaṃ vidyataityeva saṃbhavatīti na śakyaṃ tadddā reṇeṣṭellaukika viṣayatvamavadhārayitum /	hence the mere presence of the evil effect would not justify our taking the Ishte as pertaining to the case of the ordinary Horsegift, as also to that of the Vedic one. The Bhashya brings forward the pain entailed in the keeping and feeding of the animal, though belonging to the Receiver, because it has not yet been proved that his action is not the cause for the Ishti because the fact of the Ishti being performed by the giver will be proved in the next Adhikarapa.
atha vā dāturapi prāk parakhatvāpādanādeṣa kleśo 'stīti gamayitavyam /	Or it may be taken as said with refer ence to the giver, who also, prior to his creating the ownership of another, has got to undergo all the trouble of keeping and feeding the animal.
dharmo'pi ca śṛṇotyeva naraṃ saṃsāravarttinam /	And further, Dharma Virtue also is found to cover the man, while he exists in the metempsychic current as the body that covers the Person is not made of sin alone.
na hi kevalapāpena dehenācchādyate naraḥ	. Sūtra It is not laid down for the Giver because of the difference in the functions of the Giver and the Receiver.
yatra vidhyuddeśaḥ saṃdigdhaḥ tatra vākyaśeṣānnirṇayo na virudhyate /	Question When we have the sentenceyocrampratigrhṇāti,etc. distinctly laying it down for the Receiver, wherefore should there arise any such question ? Reply Because the beginning of the passage is found to begin with a sentence that points to the Giver,i.e.
yava svasaṃdigdhastava tahalauyastvāddākya śeṣabādhenaiva bhavitavyam /	In a case, on the other hand, where the object of the Injunction is definitely known, the superior authority of the Injunction would justify us in rejecting the indications of the Rest of the Sentence.
ata iha yadyapi prajāpatirvaruṇāyāśvamanayaditi prajāpatirdātā saṃkorttito varuṇaḥ pratigrahautā punaśca samvāṃ devatāmiti prajāpatireva sa mānavibhaktyantaḥ sāmānādhikaraṇyenopāttaḥ khā ca tasya devatā varuṇaḥ pūrvaṃ saṃpradānatvenopāttatvāt /	Thus then, in the case in question, wo find that the sentence Praja patir Varunaya,etc. describes Prajapati as the Giver, and Varuna as the Receiver of the gift then again, the sentence sa svam Dēvatām unayat points to Prajapati, by means of the word sa, inasmuch as this word has the same caseending the Nominative as Prajapatih in the previous sentence, and as such the two are coextensive and Prajapatis own Deity Svā Dēvată would be Varuna because it is he that has been previously mentioned as the Recipient of the offering, and Prajapatis own self could not be his own Deity, because, if the same thing had the mutually contradictory characters of the eand Recipient, one of these two will have to be taken as figurative.
nāpi prajāpatervaruṇo dātā vibhaktivyatyayaprasaṅgāt /	Nor can Varuna be taken as the Giver to Prajapati because that would involve a reversing of the caseendings ie, the Nominative in Prajapatih and the Dative in Varunaya would have to change places.
tena prajāpatirapūvaṃ datvā varuṇaṃ prāpta i ca iti ka pu pā / tantravārtike / tyarthaḥ /	And thus we find that the sense of the whole passage comes to be this Prajāpati, having given the horse to Varupa, and thereby being attacked with Dropsy, got rid of that disease by performing the Väruni Ishti consequently if one should happen to make the gift of a horse, he should perform the same Ishti,which shows that the Ishti has to be performed by the Giver.
saetaṃ vāruṇaṃ catuṣkapālamapaśyatta niravapadipti prajāpatereva tacchabdena parāmarśāt /	Then again, inasmuch as the accessories of a sacrifice are its subsidiaries, it is necessary that they should have the same performer as the Primary sacrifice and in the case in question it is the Performer of the Primary sacrifice that is the owner and the Giver of the Horse.
tannirabapaditi ca kartatva nirdeśa tasyaivābakalpate na varuṇasya saṃpradānatvena sthitatvāt /	whe jo Notwithstanding all this, however, inasmuch as we find the object of the Injunction yoçvan pratigrhniyat,etc. and the Arthavada Prajāpatiḥ,etc. having contrary significations, there should be no doubt as to which of these should be accepted as it is well known that the Injunction is more authoritative than the Arthavada and as such the law of the Satra I iv and thus it would be necessary to accept the signification of one of these two and reject that of the other.
na hyātmane saṃkalpyamānaṃ tyaktaṃ syāt /	Because such Jojunctions have for their object something that has not been subject to any other means of knowledge and as such an assumptiou, in the case of these, of any signification other than the direct one would be wholly unwarrantable.
tena prajāpatinā 'śvaṃ datvā varuṇāya varuṇagṛhautena vārugaṇa dyā tadunmocanamātmanaḥ kṛtam /	Consequently, even though the first portion of the passagewh which is an Arthavadais a distinct eulogy of the action of the Giver, yet it should be taken as indirectly figuratively applying to its correlative, the action of the Receiver just as in the case of the sentence apo vai çäntäḥ vide supra.
ato'nyo 'pi datvaivaṃ kuryāditi dāturiti vijñāyate /	Thus then, on account of the two functions, of Giving and Receiving, being wholly distinct and different, this action Ishti, that we find mentioned in connection with the Receiver, we can never accept as laid down for the Giver.
yajñāṅgatvācca taccheṣā pradhānenaikakarṭa kāḥ /	Or it may meanthe action of the yajamana we cannot accept as the prompting cause of the Ishts... Sutra On account of Indications, it should have to be performed by the Person appointing the Priests for the sacrifice.
pradhānasya ca yaḥ karttā svāmī dātā sa vājinām	by the yajamāna,the word being explained as one who is the lord or appointer of the Rtvik priests.
pūrvādhikaragonaivaitatpratipāditaprāyaṃ yaduta dāturiṣṭiriti / yadā hyaśvapratigrahavataḥ karmaṇo'ṅagamevetyavadhāritaṃ tadā pradhānānāme ka deśakāla kartṛkanyāyādya eva kratoḥ karttā tenaiveyamapi karttavyā yaśca kratoḥ karttā sa khāmikarmaparikraye ityevamaśvasya dātā tasmādasaṃdigdhameva dāturiṭyā bhavitavyam /	Or the sutra may be explained thus There being a doubt as to whether the Ishte would be done by the yajamana or the Rtvik, we should conclude it to belong to one, with whom it would be pointed out by Indicative power to be connected. We now proceed to show how the fact of the prompting cause of the Ishti consisting of a certain functioning of the yajamana is pointed out by Indications. First of all, we hold that there is one Indicative Force in the shape of the capability of the Action itself and the second is that belong ing to the sentence, and cognisable by looking closely into what precedes and follows it. It has been almost proved in the previous Adhikarana that the Ishti is to be performed by the Giver of the Horse, and when it is definitely ascertained that the Ishfi is a subsidiary of that sacrifice at which the Horse is given and accepted as the sacrificial gift, then, in accordance.
marthyaṃ yatpradhānenaikakartṛkaṃ sadupakāraṃ śaknoti karttu na bhinnakartṛkam /	There is a peculiar potentiality in the subsidiary, whereby it is only when it is performed by the same person that performs its Primary sacrifice, that it can help in the completion of this latter, which it can never do, if performed by another person.
tena pradhānavadeveta raistasyā madhyātvijaṃ katavyama na yājamānamiti /	And hence, in the Ishti, the duties that belong to the priests would be performed by them, just as in the case of the Primary sacrifice while they could not perform that which belongs to the yajamāna.
evaṃ siddhe 'pi vākyopakramopasaṃhāravirodhakṛtabhrāntisaṃśaya vyadāsa māvārthamuttaramadhikaragāmārabdhavyam / tasyāpi ca vākyasaṃbandhopakramopasaṃhārasyedvaśameva sāmarthya yahāturvidhatte na hotāvadeva vākyaṃ yāvato 'śvān pratigṛhṇīyāttāvataścatuṣkapālānvāruṇānnirvapediti /	Even though this is a fairly wellestablished fact, yet, inasmuch as some people might have doubts caused by certain misconceptions arising out of the apparent contradiction of the first portion of the pas sage by the subsequent portions, it is necossary to consider the present Adhikarana, for the setting aside of those doubts. And as a matter of fact, we find that the potency of the syntactical connection, from beginning to end, is such as distinctly points to the fact of the Ishti being performed by the Giver. Because the sentence does not extend only so far as that One should perform as many catushkapala sacrifices as there may be horses that he accepts, but it is found to begin with quite a different.
kiṃ tardhyanyo 'pyupakrama prajāpatirvaruṇāyāśvamanayahityādirasya vidyate /	Objection “It is true that this has been explained but it has also been explained that the indications of the first portion of the passage. ie. Prajapatir varunāya,etc. are rejected by the superior authority.
sa ca dāturiṣṭiṃ pratipādayatotyuktam / nanvetadapyuktaṃ vidhupradeśabalauyastvābādhyate 'sāviti /	of the Injunction yoçvan pratigrhniti, etc..! Reply It is not so because the indications of the eulogy are set aside by the Injunction, only when this latter has fully obtained its foot ing in the case in question, however, the Injunction with regaid to the Receiver of the gift for performing the Ishti has not quite obtained its footing, at the time that we come across the Arthavāda.
naitadasti /	in obtaining a footing.
kutaḥ /	for modifications.
statilabdhātmakatvena vidhāheśena bādhyate / pratigrahītari tvava vidhupradeśo na kalpitaḥ	Wa It has been argued above that the Injunction is possessed of an authority superior to that of the Arthavadu. We readily admit that that which is an Injunction is of superior authority but in the case in question, we have no such Injunction as that the Ishti should be per formed by the Receiver of the gift.
satyapi pradhānaguṇabhāve vidhārthavādānāṃ pūrvāparoccāraṇakṛto 'nyo viśeṣo bhavati /	And then, one Person, who has been previously recog nised as the object of the Injanction, looking forward to the Inference of the Injunction as pointed out by the Arthavada, stands in need of that Injunction only, and nothing else besides that.
sarvacaiva tāvanmukhyaṃ vā 'pūrvacodanāllokavaditi ca śrutiliṅaṅgādhikaraṇanyāyena ca pūrvaṃ vijñānamanupajātapratiindri dvitīyavijñānāntarānutpattyavasthatvādāñjasyenātmānaṃ labhate paścāttanaṃ tu pūrvavijñānāvaruddhajñāna viṣayaupajāyamānaṃ satyāṃ virodhāvasthāyāṃ tadānuguṇyātiriktena rūpeṇotpattumeva na śaknotīti anyathātvamapi pratipadyate /	And as for the Arthavada and the Injunction, both of them are equally capable of signifying their own respective objects and the only faculty that the Arthavada does not possess, is that of enjoining and hence it is only the element of Injunction that it would borrow from the subsequent Injunction but by this bor rowing, it does not take in all the other factors also of the Injunction as it does not stand in need of these. Consequently, inasmuch as the use of the Injunctive Affix for the sake of the mention of the prompting cause of the Ishti would not be possible without a Verhal Root, it becomes necessary to use some Verbal Root or other and we find the root grhnati used in gṛhṇīyāt, which is however taken in the sense of the function ing of the Giver and hence there is nothing incongruous in the use of the word gṛhṇīyāt . If we did not take the two the Injunction and the Arthavada thus, the sense of the whole would be because in olden times the Giver of the Horse did so and so, therefore at the present time, the Receiver should do likewise,which would be wholly irrelevant and absurd. For these reasons, it must be admitted that the Injunction also has referred to the Giver as described in the Arthavada. Objection Then, inasmuch as it will have been dealt with under that Sutra, there would be no need of the present Adhikaraṇa.
tadiha vidhārthavādatvakṛtaṃ viśeṣaṃ pūrvapaścādbhāvitayā 'nāśrityopakramopasaṃhārayotipratigrahītaviṣayatvena vipratipadyamānārthatvāttathā sati caikavākyatvāsambhavāt /	Consequently only that can be regarded as the said prompting cause, the existence of which is a certainty. Nor is the acceptance of the Horsegift mentioned simply with a view to the pointing out of the prompting cause as the mention ends with the mere pointing out of the particular relationship between the two. Consequently, we come to the conclusion that the Ish forms part of the procedure to be observed in the giving away of the Horse and this use of the Isht shows that the giving away meant is that con nected with Vedic sacrifices. Thus then the Ishti cannot be taken as related to anything that is not enjoined.

Or, inasmuch as the Nominative character resides in the causative also, when the causal character would be meant to be spoken of, then, in that case, we would have the cansative affix, even in connection with the root signifying the functioning of the caused while when the mere Nominative character would be meant to be expressed, then even without the causative affix,anyone who, in some way or other, helps in the accomplishment of the Acceptance of the Horse gift, we may speak as accepting grhnali. For instance, in the sentence he tills the ground with six ploughs, we fud that, though the word tills signifies the making of the lines of furrows, yet through the force of the mention of the six ploughs, we take the Verb as indicating the action of the Director of the Ploughing, as the actual operating of six ploughs could not be done by any single Plough man consequently we conclude that the Person, who directs the opera tions of all the six Ploughmon, is also the Performer of the tilling, through these men and hence it is he that comes to be spoken of as tilling the ground with six ploughs. Similarly, the root gṛhṇātī having its signification conditionod by the Arthavada, would come to be taken as indicating the function of the person causing the grahana or acceptance i.e.
kiṃ ca /	the Giver.
bhūyasāṃ ca sadharmatvamasminpace bhaviṣyati /	and it often happens that, in view of the peculiar character of their auxiliaries, they are taken even in such a sense as is not generally known.

To the above conclusion, some people make the following objections In the passage, as read in the text of the Maiträyuni Rescension of the Yajurveda, we find the first sentence of the passage in question read as sa eshoçvah pratiyrhyate and thus this being quite in keeping with the subsequent Injunction, it is clearly cognisable that the Ishti is to be performed by the Person receiving the Horsegift.
yadyapi pratiṣedhavacanaṃ syāt tathāpi vihitapratiṣiḍavāhikalpī bhavenna khokatanyāyavyudāsaḥ /	To this some people make the following reply Our position having been proved, by reasonings, to be stronger than yours, if we come to be vanquished by means of another scriptural text, what can we do P But this fear of being vanquished is wholly, groundless.
yatta pratigrahoturvidhāyakaṃ tadyadi tāvatkarmāṅgavaśena vināyupakramaviśeṣātpūrvavākyārthānusāryeva bhavati tatastenāpi dātudeva /	Because even if we had another scriptural text distinctly laying down the perform A ance of the Ishti by the Receiver,then too, all that we would have to admit is that it would be performed by the Receiver also but that would not set aside its performability by the Giver. That is to say, it has been proved that the text of the passage as quoted above, which is the one found in the text of the Taittiriya Res cension of the Yajurveda,distinctly points to the fact of the Ishti being performed by the Giver.
atha tu svātalyāt pratigṛhṇātivaśāt pratigrahītumtataḥ pūrvavākyācca dāturityubhau kariṣyatastatpratiguhoṭagatā ca karmāṅgatvābhāvātpuruṣārthā sato laukikepi syāt / yastvāvije syādityetatsūtraparaḥ san pūrva vākye nāpi pratigrahautureva vadati tena tatkartṛkāyā karmāṅgatva /	In fact, even if we had a text prohibiting the performance of that Ishti by the Giver, we would have two optional alternatives, and there would be no necessity of abandoning the conclusion once accepted before. As for the sentence yocvam pratigrhniyat,etc. which lays down the performability of that Ishti by the Receiver of the Horsegift, if, by reason of its forming part of the sacrifice, it be taken in a manner in keeping with the previous sen tence, without paying any heed to the particular way in which the passage might openthen, in that case, that sentence too would point out the performability by the Giver. If, on the other hand, through the pre sence of the word pratigrhṇāti, the sentence be taken independently by itself, as laying down its performability by the Receiver,then, in that case, inasmuch as the previous sentence will have indicated its perform ability by the Giver, it would come to be performed by both the Giver as a well as the Receiver with this difference however, that the Ishti per formed by the Receiver, being only calculated to serve the purposes of the Man independently of any Vedic sacrifice, it would have to be performed, in the case of the acceptance of the Ordinary Horsegift also. Some people, taking their stand upon the word Artvije in the sutra, argue that the previous sentence Prajapatirvaruṇāya,etc. also speaks of the performability of the Ishti by the Receivor i.e.
bhāvātvijāmitareṣāṃ ca puruṣārthaphalakalpanātulyatvena lokikepi prāptau satyāṃ kena pramāṇena tasmādyajñe pratoyetetyetadabhidhīyataiti vaktavyam / tasmādanena tāvahāturiti siddham / pānavyāpacca tait	But the Ishte that would be performed by the Rtvik Priest, could not form part of the sacrifice itself which is being performed by the Yajamana and hence the relationship of the result of the Ishti would be as possible for the ordinary man of the world as for that Priest con sequently we would have the performance of the Ishti even in the case of the acceptance of the Horsegift in ordinary life and under the circum stances, it becomes incumbent upon those persous to explain what grounds the sutra would have for declaring, as the conclusion tasmat yajne prati yeta consequently it would be cognised as to be performed in connection with the Vedic sacrifice.
ayamapyanāramyavāda eva /	A Thus then, from the mere fact of the Isht being laid down as forming.
saumendraṃ caru nirvapedyaḥ somaṃ vamatīti /	. Sūtra The case of the vomiting of the drink is similar. Apart from any particular Context, we find another sentence Somaindran curunnirvapēt yaḥ somam vamati. One who vomits the soma should offer the Somaindra caru.
tatrāpi pūrvavadevādhikaraṇahayamapi vi cāryate /	And in regard to this, too, we proceed to consider the same questions as those dealt with in the two pre ceding Adhikaraņas,i.e.

And this being the question, the expression tadvat in the sütra indicates the two theories of the Purvapakshaviz that the Soma drinking meant is both that which is done at a sacrifice and that done as medicine and that it is the latter only as propounded in Sutra .
atha vādhikaraṇaiyamapi siddhāntarūpeṇādhikaragāiye 'pyatidiśyate kena cihiśeṣeṇa pūrvapacaracanā /	Or the expression tadvat may be taken as indicating the application of the Siddhāntas of the last two Adhikaranas, to the present question also. And as the Purvapaksha of the present Adhikaraṇa differs a little from that of the last two Adhikaranas, we lay it down, in the following words .
tatreha tāvavairikena pānena dravyapratipādanasya kṛtatvānna kadā cid bheṣe punaḥ pratisamādhānāpekṣā 'stotyanartha kamiṣṭividhānam /	In the case of the Somadrinking at a Vedic Sacrifice, inasmuch as the disposal of the substance Soma will have been done by the mere drinking of it, if there were to be any subsequent disorders, in the shape of vomiting and the like,it would not necessitate any remedial measures and hence in that case, the laying down of the Ishti the Somaindra would be absolutely useless.
laukike tu vamanena vyāpanne rasāyanaguṇābhāvādindriyeṇa vīryeṇa ca vyaddhiḥ saṃbhāvyate / na jalodaravadatyantāsaṃbhāvanā /	While in the case of the Soma drunk in ordinary life, if the Soma happens to be vomited out, there would be none of the medicinal effects desired and hence in the case, there would be a possibility of the loss of virility,etc. mentioned as following from a neglect of the Somaindra Ishti and there is no im possibility of such evil effects, as we found in the case of Dropsy in the preceding Adhikarana and thus as the evil effects would be possible the Somaindra Ishti, that is laid down in connection with those effects, also comes to be recognised as a remedy for these effects.
tasmāttatra syāditi /	Consequently, this Isht should be performed at the vomiting of the Soma drunk in ordinary life.
dopāttu vaidike syādarthāhi laukike na doṣaḥ syāt	Sūtra It would be performed at the vomiting of the Soma drunk at the Vedic sacrifice as it is only at this that it creates an evil effect while in the case of that drunk in ordinary life, as this would be done for a visible purpose, there could be no evil effects attached to its vomiting.
taireva vaidikatvasāmānyādibhirvedike bhavatīti ka smānnocyate /	Objection Why do not you bring forward the same arguments that you did in the last two Adhikaranas,that the action in question being Vedic, it would apply only to the Vedic sacrifice, etc.,etc. ? Reply The reason is that there can be no Vedic character attaching to the vomiting because no vomiting is found to be enjoined in the Veda, Consequently, the result of vomiting, even in the case of Vedic Soma drinking would be the same as those in that of the ordinary Somadrinking.
na hi vamane vaidikatvaṃ saṃbhavati acoditatvāt ato ya eva doṣo laukikagāmitve hetuḥ sa eveha vaidika viṣayatve syāt /	That is to say, as a matter of fact, there are no evil effects attaching to the vomiting of the Soma drink in ordinary life because it is drunk only for the sake of being vomited. Even if there were some evil effects, their remedy would consist of certain measures laid down in works on medicine, and there would he no need of any Vedic remedy such as the Somaindra Ishti.
samyak jaraṇarūpāntā pratipattirvidhīyate sadyāpadi pradhānasya na bhavetpūrvavatphalam	If the sentence laying down the Somaindra Ishti were the Arthu sada portaining to the result, then it would be all the more inapplicable o the case of ordinary Somadrinking, by reason of the necessity, in this ase, of the assumption of a result as there is none actually perceptible.
' yaḥ somaṃ vamati sa nirvapediti yacchandata cchabdayogādyāgavamanayorekaḥ karttā gamyate /	Because the vomiting of the Yajamāna causes as much discrepanc in the Disposal, as that of the Priests, as the drinking of both is mean to serve as purificatory of the substance Soma. Sutra It would pertain to the Master only a the action is performed for his sake. the Yajamana.
tatra naimittikaṃ tāvalyāmikaḷkatvenāsaṃdigdhaṃ tenāsaṃdigdhena saṃdigdhaṃ vamanaṃ nirgīyate / tadapi khāmikarṭa kameva sannimittamiti /	And from this certain fact we come to a definite conclusion with regard to the doubtful case of the vomiting also,that it is only when the vomiting is done by the Yajamana that it serves as the prompting cause of the Ishti.
na ca svatantrameva nimittaṃ śuddhenākhyātena nimittapratyayānutpādāt / yacchabdopabaddhaṃ tannimittaṃ pratipādayati /	Nor is the vomiting, independently by itself, capable of serving as the prompting cause as the more Verb ramati is incapable of giving any idea of such a cause it is only when it is accompanied by the word yah that it expresses that Cause and in that case, the fact of the two actions of sacrifice and vomiting having the same performer is cognised before the fact of the vomiting being the prompting cause of the Ishti.
atharirvajo devatārtha mṛtvikaparikrayārthaṃ ca dravyaṃ tyajanti tatasteṣāṃ svātmani parikrayavirodhādavaśyaṃ tairapyanye 'dhvavadayo varītavyāḥ /	Now then, if the Priests were to perform the Ishti on account of their own vomiting, they would be offering substances either for a Deity or in exchange for some services, as they could not effect this exchange for themselves, it would be necessary for them to engage other Adhvaryu and other priests.
ādhānagatena tvātmanepadenāgnīnāmā ghātṛvyatiriktapuruṣasaṃbandhābhāvātvātmārtheṣvagniṣu yaṣṭavyam /	And on account of the Atmanepada affix in the word adadhita in the sentence agninädadhita, it is clear that the sacrificial fire can have no connection with any person other than the one who has duly lighted it and hence it is necessary for all performers of sacrifices to make the offering in the Fire lighted for themselves.
tataśca yadi tābahāntasomakarmopakārabuḍyā kurvanti tato deśakālakabhedādviguṇaṃ na tena pradhānena gṛhyate /	Consequently if the Priests perform the Ishti in question, with a view to help in the Sacrifice, the Soma drunk at which had been vomited by them, then the Ishti which they would perform would be performed in a place, and at a time, different from that of the original Principal Sacrifice. As those Ishtis would be performed in distinct Fires lighted by each of the Priests separately and as such the help accorded by these Ishtis would not accrue to the Original Sacrifice.

As for the sen tenceyah somam ramati, etc.,inasmuch as this has all its requirements fulfilled by the vomiting by the sacrificer, it cannot be taken as permitting the difference in the time and place of the Auxiliary Ishtis from those of the Original Sacrifice.

evamapi kratvarthenāvadhāritamya punaḥ puruṣārthatvābhāvāttādarthena kriyamāṇasya ānardhakyameva syāt /	And if, for the sake of justifying such performance, the Ishti be taken, on the strength of scriptural texts, to be for the sake of Man,then, that would involve the abandoning of the sacrifice that appears in close prox imity to it, as also the assuming, for such an Ishti, another result, in the shape of Heaven or some other end, that would be desirable by the Man, This same assumption of a result has been shown to be necessary, in the case of the Ishti being taken as to be performed at the vomiting of the Soma drunk in ordinary life.
sadṛśaṃ laukikavamane 'pyetaditi na yājñe syāt tacca pūrvameva nirākṛtam /	But it could not be said with regard to the Ishti that would be performed at the vomiting of that drunk during a sacrifice as we have already shown that, in this latter case, the assump tion of a fresh result is not necessary the effect of the Ishti being simply to accord help to the sacrifice, by the remedying of the discrepancy caused by the vomiting.
tasmātyāmivamane syāt /	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the Ishti should be per formed only when the vomiting would be that by the Yajamana.

But in that case, we have the aforesaid anomaly of the two actions of the Offering of the Ishti, and the vomiting not having the same performer.
tatsamarthane vā 'śrutaṣaṣṭyartha kalpanā sāmānādhikaraṇyabādhaśca tathā kalpanāyāṃ ca svāmivamanasyānimittatvaprasaṅkaḥ /	And for the justification of this, it would be necessary to take the word yah in yah somam vamati in the sense of the Genitive yasya, and hence to reject the coextensiveness between yaḥ and sah. And these interpretations would make the text inapplicable to the case of the Vomit ing by the Yajamāna, which therefore would no longer be a prompting causo for the Ishti.

Then, if, with a view to avoid this syntac tical split, we have got to accept only one of them either the vomiting by the Yajamana, or that by the Priests as the prompting cause of the Ishți, it is only right that we should accept the former would be in keeping with the sense of the words of the text.

As for the Result that accrues to the Priests, in the shape of the sacrificial gifts,they are found to obtain it, in any case, whether there be a vomiting or not and as such there being no fear of this Result being interfered with by any vomiting, it would not stand in need of the Remedial Ishti, and as such could not bring about its per formance.

But even so too, inasmuch as the said flaw only being an obstacle in the way of the due realisation, by the Yajamāna, of the Results of the sacrifice, the Ishti would serve the purpose of removing that obstacle, and as we have in the sentence the words. yah and sah which indicates the performer of both actions to be one only, it must be admitted that the Ishti should be performed, at the vomiting by the Yajamana only.

PE But in that case also, inasmuch as we find the word yaḥ distinctly pointing to the Man, the Ishti must be regarded as a purification of the Man mentioned in the Context, in accordance with the conclusion arrived. Janjabhyamanonubrüte.

ataśca yadi tahamanamaduṣṭameva tatastūṣṇīmevāsitavyam / atha duṣṭaṃ tatasmā mānyavihitaṃ kiṃcitkarttavyam /	Consequently we come to the conclusion that if the vomiting by the Priest should be a flaw in the sacrifice, then whenever it should happen, all that we have to do is to quietly ignore it altogether while if it do create a discrepancy in the sacrifice, then, in that case, we might perform some ordinary expiatory rite.

evaṃ ca sati tataścet kiṃ cidapyapanauyeta tadā 'nyat śrutamanyatkriyeta tasmātsarvabhakṣepaḥ /	. Such being the case, if a part of the material were left behind, then that would mean the doing of something contrary to what has been laid down in the Veda. Hence it must be admitted that the whole of the material is to be offered into the Fire.

ataḥ paśyannevāne nābhiprāyeṇa mantrayataiti vaktavyam / vidyamāneṣu śeṣeṣu dravyāṇāmaprayojakāḥ /	And so long as we can get at these in a simple way, there can be no justification for having recourse to a more complicated method and hence, in accord ance with Agneyyadhikarana, it must be admitted that the sentences refer to the Ashtakapāla Cake, with regard to which the two factorsof giving away, and that to a Deityare already knowu being laid down in the sentences Agneyaḥ, etc..
evamihāpi yatpradhānahaviyo̭ 'nyaṣṭavistenaivānyatvenādhikyena vā bhaviṣyati /	Nor would this involve any incompati bility with the fact of this Cake having been originally laid down as direct auxiliary to the Sacrifice as that which is thrown into the Fire, loses nothing of its character of being an auxiliary to the Sacrifice to Agni.

yadyāgneyo 'ṣṭākapāla ityevamādova bhavettataḥ sarvapradānamevāvadhāryeta /	with the injunction that the oma is offered into the Sacrificial Fire, we come to the conclusion that the Twoslices offering is to be thrown into the Sacrificial Fire.
dyavadānaṃ juhvatītyevamādivākyālocanena hi kiṃ cideva hotavyamavagatamataḥ śeṣayitavyaṃ kiṃ cit / upāyo vā tadarthatvāt	Now then, there remains yet another question to be dealt with Is this Homa of the Twoslices something wholly different from the previous Sacrifice of the Cake, and forms a mere part of the procedure of this latter? Or is it a part of the same Sacrifice, which, being stretched to a further point to that Homa, becomes a little modified in its form? And on this question, we unhesitatingly declare that the latter alternative is the correct one.
kṛtatvāttu karmaṇa sakqatsyāṭ dravyasya guṇabhūtatvāt	Because if it were a wholly distinct action, then it would have a wholly different material and Deity, just as we find in the case of the Nãrishtha and other such Homas.
punapunahiravakhaṇḍanaṃ tahāṃśca homo 'bhyasitavya iti /	While in the case in question we find that, in accordance with the Çabdāntarādhikaraṇa IIii, it must be admitted that it is the same Sacrifice that, being stretched further, develops into the Homa.
homaḥ pradhānabhāvāttu nāvṛttiṃ pratipadyate	Nor does this involve a disappearance of the original sacrificial character of the action, as the Homa also is a particular form of Sacrifice and though it is possible for the General to exist without the Particular, there is however no Particular possible without the General.
na cāvaśya pradānena havirāgneya miṣyate /	Just as, when we say bring the tree if we add of the Çimçapa, this addition is in no way contradictory to the original sentence,so, in the same manner, having said one should sacrifice, there can be no contradiction in the subsequent addition of Homa.

nanu hāvadānavyatiriktāvyavaprāptiḥ sāmānyena puroḍāśaśabdena kriyamāṇā durbalā syāt /	Nor does this additional operation produce any change of form or ugliness in the Sacrifice because, on the strength of Vedic texts, we are led to believe that this additional operation adds to the beauty of the Sacrifice.
yadi hyavayavārthena puroḍāśo vidhīyate / tataḥ sāmānyavṛttiḥ syātsa tu sākṣādvidhauyate devatāyai hi dātuṃ dravyaṃ tyajanti na vibhavena /	For, certainly, the fact of one foot of main having gone forward before the rest of the body does not make any differ ence in the man and in the same manner, in the case in question, if the one foot part of the Sacrifice, the Twoslice offering, is made to go a step farther, in the shape of being thrown into the Fire, that does not involve an incongruity, inasmuch as the enjoined fact of the Sacrifice being performed with the whole Cake will have been duly accomplished, all the same.
tatra yaha vatārthādanyadadhikaṃ tadgṛhāvasthitadravyāntaravadaparivyaktam /	Consequently we might take the Principal Action Sacri fice itself to have the said aforesaid two forms. L Or, the factor of ‘Yagu may be taken as the Principal, and that of Homa as the Subsidiary inasmuch as in the sentence mentioning the result t.e.
devatāsaṃbandhakaraṇa vidhinaiva hyasāvarthāpattyā''cipyate /	the sentence DarçaPurṇamāsābhyām svargakāmo yajēta, we find it mentioned in direct connection with the Yaga and as for the Homa, it is simply found to be mentioned in close proximity with it, whence it is regarded to be the subsidiary of that Yāgu.

Nor is it absolutely necessary that all actions that pertain to a common object should be regarded as t equally Primary in their character as we actually find all purificatory rites which are admitted to be subsidiaries pertaining to the same object as the Primary Sacrifice there being some of these rites that are per formed before, and some after, the performance of the Primary Sacri fice while some are done simultaneously with this latter.
tatraiva rūpāntaropajananamiti brūmaḥ /	ome people declare thus The Homa under consideration ie.

Thus then, inasmuch as the due accomplishment of the Sacrifice is accompanied or marked by the said throwing in or Homa, before this latter is done the Sacrifice must be looked upon as incomplete and hence if the material be destroyed, spoilt or stolen before the Homa has been done, it is only right that another supply of the material should he brought in. For even though the Homa is a sanctificatory rite, yet it is not absolutely incapable of being the means of having fresh materials brought in specially as even such offerings as the Svishtukrt and the like will be shown to be incapable of justifying the bringing in of fresh materials, on the sole ground of the Sacrifice having been duly completed even before these offerings. If, however, this throwing in Homa were the Primary action, then the DarçaPurnamasa would be spoken of as Homa and not as Yaga and further, inasmuch as no Primary actions are ever found to be transferred to the Modifications of Sacrifices, there could be no Homa in the Saurya and other modifications of the DargaPurnamasa and as such at these, the materials would have to be offered, without being thrown into the Sacrificial Fire.
na caitāvatā yāgasya vairupyamaśobhanaṃ mantavyam / vacanasāmarthyādīhaśasyaiva śobhanatvapratīteḥ /	Whereas in case the Homa is taken as subsidiary, there would be a transference of this into those modi fications, and so the offerings at these would have to be thrown into the Sacrificial Fire.

In the case of the originative Injunctions of Sacrifices, on the other hand, inasmuch. as the two factors of giving away and dedicating to the Deity are already pointed out by the mention of Sacrifice itself, the subsequent mention of Homa comes to be taken as pointing out only the third factor of throwing in,just as in the case of the sentences Ahavanīyē yupaçakala hotavyaḥ.
tasmād jhākāramevaitavyadhānaṃ draṣṭavyam /	And thus it is established that the Iloma is sub sidiary to the Sacrifice. Such being the case, we find that the Cake is mentioned in connec tion with the Yaga Sacrifice, and not in connection with the Homa and the Homa also is laid down for the Twoslices, and not for the whole Cake and hence the Homa comes to be recognized as being done with the Twoslices only, and with no more of the Cake.
atha vā yastatra yāgastasya prādhānyaṃ yastu prakṣepaḥ so 'ṅgameva / tathā hi /	Then as for the whole Cake, inasmuch as it has been given away or dedicated to the Deity, even though it be not thrown into the Fire, it is only natural that the Sacrificer should not look upon it as his own nor would there be any of the objections attendant upon Preclusions.
tatsaṃnnidhau samāmnānājjuhotaraṅgateṣyate	Consequently, the operations, that are laid down as to be done with the Reninants, would be duly accomplished by means of the Rem nants left after the Twoslicesetc. have been cut out of the Oake.

As a matter of fact, however, it is not so as the actions in question do not tend to the bringing in of materials for the sake of themselves and hence, just as in the case of the Tushopuvapakapala, so in the case in question also, the actions would be performed with any one of the materials only.

Even when the Principal Sacrifice has been duly completed, if we find the Remuants of the materials offered at it, there arises a desire to know in what way these should be disposed of, and as such it is only right that we should have the Injunctions as to the particular offerings through which the said Remnants are to be disposed of.

That is to say, inasmuch as the whole Cake has been given away to the Deity, the Sacrificer is no longer its owner and as such he has as much ownership over it as the Priests, Brahma and the rest con sequently just as these latter could not make any gifts of the Cake, so too the Sacrificer. Consequently if he were to effect a purchase by giving the Cake in exchange for the services rendered, he would be asserting his rights of ownership over it and thereby he would be undoing the gift that he has previously conveyed to the Deity.

The Bhäsya has made the declaration We have never seen the Brahma and other priests in any way helping the parts of the Cake.

Then goes on the Bhāṣyu with another declaration On the other hand, we find the Parts of the Cake helping the Priests and this too is not proper as in that case the giving would come to be for the purposes of the Purchase as, it is not by being eaten alone that the Cake could help them,it might help them, in some way or other, even merely by being taken home as it will be explained in all cases, that the Eating is meant as a purificatory of the material and not as helping the Priests and the Euting is not spoken of as boing left off, on the occasion of any Penance, etc., and certainly all things connected with the Mun himself would cer tainly cease on such occasions.

gṛhamapi ca nītvā yāvadbhakṣaṇaṃ na kriyate tāvattadanupayo gādanupakāraḥ /	And there can be no doubt that the purificatory rite that is most intimately connected with the performer is the Eating and hence even if they were to carry their shares home, unless they would eat them, they would not bring about any effects in themselves conse quently, howsoever far they might carry them, it is absolutely necessary that they should at last eat them.

yadapi sviṣṭakṛte vidīyate tadapi dhruvāta eva yena tadarthe 'vatte dhruvāyā pratyabhighāraṇaṃ pratiṣidhyate /	And hence it follows that the offering that is made to Svistakrt, is also taken out of the Dhruva as is shown by the prohibition in the passage quoted of the Refilling of that vessel, after the offering to Svistakrt has been made.
na hi tataḥ parāmāhutimitihetuvacanātpūrvāṇi pratyabhidhāraṇāni sviṣṭakṛdarthānīti darśayati /	And then again, the distinct injunction, that there should be no offerings after that to Svishtakrt, also indicates that the previous Re fillings spoken of as following after each offering has been made were solely for the sake of being offered to Sriștakrt.

If this Samash tiyajuḥ also be regarded as an independent Principal Action, just like the Upastarana and the rest and not as a mere Offering of Remuant, then, in that case, the presence of any Remnant in the Dhruvā would be all the more impossible as the Samashtiyaju is distinctly laid down as.
yadī tvidamapyupastaragādivadevārthakarmāvadhāryate tadā sutarāṃ śeṣābhāvaḥ / śakyaṃ tu taittirīyavākyāpekṣayotpattāvanyasaṃyogāt samiṣṭayajuṣaśca juhoticoditatvenāyajñatvā vyatipattitvamavadhārayitum /	consisting of the offering of all the Butter that might be found in the Dhruva, after the Upastarana and the other actions have been done. As a matter of fact, however, we can quite reasonably take this Samashti yajuh as a mere Action of Disposal as, on referring to the text of the Taittiriya, we find that it is originatively related to another action and as, being mentioned as Homa, it cannot be regarded as a Sacrifice. And then, inasmuch as this Action is laid down as taking up all the Butter in the Dhruvā, it naturally precludes the performance of all the other Offerings of Remnants.
tasmāt dhruvāyāṃ tāvannosti śeṣaḥ /	Hence, too, it must be admitted that there can be no Remnant in the Dhruvā.
avattatvāttu juhāṃ tasya ca homasaṃyogāt	Sūtra Though it is taken out in the Juhu, yet it is the whole of that that is connected with the Homa.
tadanupapannam /	For this reason there can bo no Remnant in the Juhu either.
kutaḥ /	Sūtra Obj.
tasmānna juhvāṃ śeṣa upapadyate /	As in the cups so it would be possible in the Juhi also.
camasavaditi cet atha yaduktaṃ camasavat satyapi homasaṃyoge śeṣobhaviṣyatīti tatpariharttavyam /	It is argued that Though the Soma in the cups is laid down as to be offered in Homa, yet we always find Remnants of it in those cups and similarly, we could have a Remnant in the Juhu also in the case in question. And we have got to refute this argument which we proceed to do in the following Sutra.
na codanāvirodhāiviḥprakalpanāca	Sutra It is not so because in the case of Soma there is no infringement of the Injunction and also because it is brought up simply as an offering material and not as connected with Homa.
naitatsomena tulyaṃ tatra hi grahacamaseṣu haviprakalpanamātre kṛte yathā na sarvahomastathā some vacanāmaco na vidyata ityatrādhikaraṇe vacyāmaḥ / tena codanāvirodhaṃ tatva vakṣyamāṇaṃ pariharatāṃ na sarvahomo bhaviṣyati /	, there would not be a Homa of the whole quantity of the Soma and as such, in this case, there would be no incompatibility, either with the fact of the Offering of Remnant being found to serve another purpose, or with the fact of its being taken from all quarters in accordance with such sen tences as Somasyāgnē vihi, etc., or with the names given to the Cups, in the sentences Sarvataḥ pariharam açvinam bhakshayati where Açvina is the name of one of the ten Cups while every one of these facts would have been contradicted if the whole of the Soma were offered and no Remnant was left. Or ‘ codanāvirodhāt may be explained in the following mannerIn the case of the Soma, the nonoffering of the whole is not found to infringe any Injunction and as such, in view of this noninfringement, the le is not offered.
anyathā tahirodhaḥ syāt /	In the case in question, on the other hand, we find.
atha vā na tavāsamastahome sati kā ciccodanā viru dhyata ityāvirodhādasarvahīmaḥ /	the nonoffering of the whole of the Butter to be contradictory to a dis tinct Injunction. And it is this noninfringement in the case of the Soma that is the reason for there being a Remnant in the Cups.
iha tu virodhaḥ syādayameva cāvirodhā heturiti sūtragamanikā / yathā tu bhāṣyakāreṇa pūrvaṃ camasamanudāhṛtya camasavaditicediti sūtramupanyastaṃ tathā paricodanāsūtrameva homasaṃyoga naikāntikatrapradarśanārthaṃ kalpayitvā parihāro vaktavyaḥ /	Such is the sense of the Sutra. The Bhasya did not bring forward the case of the Cups, before it introduced the present Sutra and hence, in that case, it is necessary to assume an ObjectionSutra,showing that the existence of the material is not necessarily accompanied by the offering of the whole of it, and then to supply the answer to that assumed Sutra. And this answer is that, in the case of the Soma, we would have a Remnant in accordance with another declaration to that effect whereas in the case in question, we have no such other Declaration and hence there would be no Remnant and thus the reason Homasamyoyat because of connection with Homa being qualified bywhile there is no declaration to the contrary,there can be no flaw in the reason given.
atha vā 'vattatvātta juhvāmityetadeva tuśabdasyāne caśabdaṃ kṛtvā pūrvapa cavādipratyavasthānaṃ vyācacāṇaiścamaso dṛṣṭānto dātavyaḥ paraṃ vā 'nubhāṣaṇasūtraṃ vaktavyam /	Or.again, in Sūtra , we could substitute the word ca in the place of tu, and then take the Sutra as embodying an objection brought for ward by the Purvapakshi and those who would take the Sutra thus would have to cite, in support of their contention, the instance of the Cups and then Sutra would be taken as recalling that instance.
tasyottaraṃ tasya ca homasaṃyogāditi gatārtham /	And, in this case, the sense of Sutra would be thusThe opponent hav ing urged that because of its being taken out in the Juhu, there would be a Remnunt, as in the case of the Cups,the reply is that, that is connected with Homa and this has already been explained above.
utpannādhikārātsati sarvavacanam	Sūtra The word all applies to that which exists in the case in question because the word pertains to those alone that have been mentioned in connection with the case.
yastu sarvebhya iti prātyapekṣo 'nuvādastava yādṛrśa vayamiha sarvatvaṃ paśyāmaḥ tādṛśasyaivānuvāda iti manyāmahe / sarvacaiva ca paramasarveṇa vyavahārābhāvādadhikṛtāpekṣaḥ sarvaśabdo gṛhyata iti na virodhaḥ /	As for the descriptive reference contained in the sentence Sarvebhyo havirbhyah,a reference which is based upon a previously indicated possi bility of the offering of all materials,we take the all referred to be that which we perceive in the case in question because in any case tho word all can only be used relatively with reference to things that may appear in the present connection as it is absolutely impossible to speak anything of the Absolute All and as such our view is not incompatible with this use of the word all.
tena yeṣāṃ śeṣamabhāvena pratipattikāryādhikāro 'sti ye vā vidyamānatvena prakṛtaśeṣāḥ tebhyaḥ sarvebhya iti gamyate tantravārtika /	Thus then the words Sarveblyāḥ havirbhyah must be taken to refer to those materials which, on account. of their being remnants of those, are capable of Disposal, or those that exist merely as Remnants of the original materials.
jātiviśeṣātparam	. Sutra The other is based upon a particular genus.
pūrvavadeva samavadyateḥ anuvādatvādyathāsaṃbhavamā jye 'pauti carāvavadīyamāne saumyāttadavayavasyācikaurṣitamapyavadānaṃ balāivati / tadetatsaṃsṛṣṭadravyajātihayamapekṣya saṃśabdo 'nuvādaḥ /	As in the previous case, so in the present one also, the word samava dyati is a mere descriptive reference, and as such it could apply to~ the Butter also consequently, when the Caru would be cut up for being offered, that would inevitably involve the cutting upeven though not desiredof its parts also, on account of these being intimately mixed up. Consequently the prefix Sam iu Samavadyati should be taken as a mere descriptive reference based upon the fact of the two subtly mixed up genuses of Caru and Butter.
antyamarekārtham	. Sutra The last refers to the nonemptiness of the vessel.
antya yattu kāraṇaṃ sviṣṭakadartho 'rthavāda ityukta ta dammatpace 'pyupapadyataevārakārthatvāt /	The last argument that has been brought forward by the Purvapaksha in Sutra , is that based upon the Arthavada with regard to the Svishtukyt.
sviṣṭakṛte 'vadāyeti tāvadyatastamyāvadānaṃ bhavati yādṛśaṃ vā saṃbhavati tādṛśamiti gamyate / puroḍāśādibhyaśca tasyāvadānaṃ dhruvātaścopastaraṇābhighāraṇe /	That is to say, in the sentence Svishtakṛtevadāyan · na pratyabhighārayati, the ‘avadānu offering spoken of must be taken as that cutting which is made out of that material from which it is actually made, or from which it can be done. As a matter of fact, we find that this Avadāna is capable of being done out of such materials as the Cake and the like while what is done out of the Dhruva is only the action of Upastarana and Abhigharuna.
na caturghyantena dhauvamevāvadānaṃ saṃbadhyate /	Nor do we find the Avadana out of the Dhruvà connected with the Dative in Svishṭakṛtë.
sā hi devatārthadravyāntarāvadāne'pyupastaraṇābhighāraṇopayogitvātpratyabhidhāraṇamapecataeva tena prāka sviṣṭakataḥ parastādapi dhauvopayogo 'stautyavatte avatte pratipūrayitvā tataḥ paraṃ tu na kiṃ citkāryamiti nārthaḥ pratipurona /	Specially as even though some other substance may have been offered to the Deity, yet the Dhruva would stand in need of Refilling Pratyabhighāraṇa for the sake of the actions of Upastaraṇa and Abhiyhāraṇa, in connection with which it has been found to be useful. And thus there would be a use for the Dhruvã, before the Svishtakṛt offering, even after the other offerings have been made, and hence with each offering, it should be refilled but when the Svishtakrt offering has been made, there is nothing more to be done and hence there is no further need for refilling it.
na hyetatpratipūraṇaṃ pūrvasthā vadānasya saṃskārakamadṛṣṭārthatvaprasaṅgāt /	Nor can the re fillings be regarded as purificatory of the previous offerings as that would necessitate the assumption of an invisible result for them.
arekastūttarakāryārthaḥ pratyakṣastanmādantareṇāpi striṣṭakṛdarthatvaṃ tadavadhikārekārthatvenopapanno 'rthavādaḥ /	As for the nonemptiness of the Vessel, it is clearly for the sake of the action to be performed next consequently without making the Artha vada in question apply to the Sviştahrt, we could explain it as referring to.
sākaṃprasthāyye sviṣṭakkṛdiḍaṃ ca tadvat	the nonemptiness of the Vessel prior to the Svishtakrt offering.
'yathā sambhavamartho 'pī'ti ka ga pu pā /	Sutra The performance of the Svistakrt and the Ida in connection with the Sākamprasthãyya, also is like the above.
amāvāsyāyāṃ nityaṃ sviṣṭakadiḍaṃ sāntrāyyādavadīyate taha, gavikāraśca sākaṃprasthāyyaḥ śrata ihāpyavadātavyamityetāvatā viśeṣegātulyāśaṅkāyāmatideśaḥ kriyate /	In connection with the Amavasya Sacrifices, we have always the per formance of the Sviştakrt and the Ida, out of the Sannayya material and the Sākamprasthāyya is a modification of the material of the Săn nayya and hence there is an idea that those actions should be performed out of that modification also and on this point the case of the Sākum prasthayya differs from that the Butter in the Dhruva though, in accord ance with the rule Prakrtivad Vikṛtiḥ, the Offering of Remnants would be performed in connection with the Sakamprasthayya, just as with the Sannayya. And hence there being a doubt as to whether the case in question is amenable to the reasonings of the foregoing Adhikaranu,the present Sûtra serves the purpose of pointing out the fact of the case of the Sakamprasthayya being exactly the same as that of the Butter in the Dhruva.
tahadevāśeṣatvānnaivaṃ syātmavaṃdānādaśeṣateti /	That is to say, just as in the case of the latter, so in the former also, there would be none of the offerings, on account of there being no Remnant, this absence of Remnant being due to the whole of it having being taken up Suträ .
evaṃ hyatra savaṃdānaṃ homāyeṃ prasarpataḥ saha kumbhaubhiriti anavattasyaiva dohasya kumbhībhyāṃ saheti vidadhadaśeṣahomaṃ vidadhāti ato na śakyaṃ kiṃ ciccheṣayitum /	And in this case the fact of the whole of it having been taken up is shown by the following We find the sentence Homärthē prasarpataḥ saha kumbhibhiḥ, which lays down the unpartitioned milk, as to be offered along with the milking pots and this distinctly shows that the whole of the material is offered because when the pots also have been offered, there cannot be any Remnant and hence it is not possible for any Remnant to be kept.
sautrāmaṇyāṃ ca graheṣu	. Sutra So also in the case of the Sautrāmaṇī there would be no Remnants in the vessels.
tahaditi varttate /	The phrase tadvat is to be supplied from the preceding Sutra.
sautrāmaṇyāṃ surāgrahā payograhāścāśvinādaya ātrātāsteṣāṃ pṛthakprakalpanamātrātmakatvāt camasavatsarvahomaprāptirnāstīti viśeṣāśaṅkāyāmatideśāttatrāpi yathāgṛhītānāṃ homārthenādānena saṃbandho yathopāttānāṃ ca homena thūyate /	In connection with the Sautrāmani, we find mentioned certain vessels of wine, and of milk, named Açvina and the like and inasmuch as these vessels only serve the purpose of keeping the various materials separate just as in the case of the Cups of Soma, so in this alsothere would be no possibility of the whole of the materials being offered up. And hence inasmuch as this would lead to the idea of the case in question differing from those dealt with before and hence not amenable to the previous reasonings,the present Sutra points out the amenability of the case in question to the reasonings of the previous Adhikaranas.
yathāgṛhotān grahāndatvija upādadate uttare 'gnau payograhān juhati dakṣiṇe surāgrahāniti /	And each of these Vessels is taken up for Homa, in the same order that it is held and the Vessels as held are laid down as to be offered up, in the sentence Yathagṛhitan rtvijä upädadätē, uttare gnuu payoyra hãn juhvati, dakshinēsurāgrahān which shows that there can be no Remnants, as even the Vessels are offered up.
tadacca śeṣavacanam	Sutra The mention of Remnant also is to be explained as before.
ananyaśeṣabhūtaśca pratiṣedho 'nuvāda ucchinaṣṭi na sarvaṃ juhotīti /	The Prohibition, contained in the sentence ucchinasta, na sarvam juhoti, which is not subsidiary to an Injunction, is a mere descriptive reference.
ucchinaṣṭauti vidhiḥ tadanuvādastu niṣedhaḥ aśeṣahomaprātyā śeṣakāryanittiṃ darśayati /	Ucchinashti is an Injunction, and the subsequent Prohibition is a descriptive reference to it and this latter would point out the impossi bility of the Offering of Remnants, through the fact of the whole of the material being offered up in Homa.
vācanikasya ca śeṣasya pratipattyantaramarthakarma vā 'nyadastīti tato 'pīti viṣṭakṛdiḍaṃ ma karttavyamiti /	Then as for the Remnant that is spoken of, there may be some other action, either in the shape of a distinct Disposal, or in that of another Principal Action. And for these reasons, the Svistakrt and the Iḍā should not be performed out of the Sautrā.
dravyaikatve karmabhedātpratikarma kriyeran tantravārtika / idānoṃ sarasu śeṣakāryeṣu tahiśeṣāścintyante /	mani. . Sūtra The material being one, and the Actions “diverse, the actions in question should be per “formed with each action.” It having been established that there are certain Offerings of Rem nants to be performed, we now proceed to consider the case of particular Offerings of Remnants.
tatra sarvaṣṭaṣṭhā yāmanyonyanirapekṣa caturthyanta parikalpitaiḥ ṣaḍirgagobhinnadravyadevatāsaṃgho gairdevatāntarāvaruḍayāge devatāntarāsaṃbhavāt guṇena bhedakena ṣaṭa karmāṇi /	In connection with the Survaprshthëṣṭi, we find the passage Indrāya Rathantaraya, Indrāya Vārhatāya, IndrāyaVairūjāya, Indrāya Vairājāya, Indraya Çakvaräyu,etc. and we find that this passage speaks of six in dependent Deities, shown by the six words with the dative ending, and hence also six different connections of the Deity and the Material and as in the Sacrifice occupied by one Deity there could be no room for the other Deity, the distinctive feature of the Deity cannot be regarded as pointing to six different actions.
teṣu keṣāṃ cihninnānyeva harvauṣi anyeṣāṃ punareka eva rathacakramātra puroḍāśa nātaḥ /	For some of these actions there are dis tinct offering materials laid down while for some of them, there is laid down a single material, in common, in the shape of the Cake of the size of the Oartwheel.
sa yadāṅgīkriyate tadā vicāra kiṃ karmabhedāccheṣakāryāṇāṃ bheda uta dravyaikatvāttanvamiti /	And when we accept this fact, we come to the considera tion of the question, as to whether the RemnantOffering would be different for each of these latter Actions, or, on account of the material being the same, there would be a single offering, in common amongst them.
nanu caikādaśavicāro 'yaṃ tatra nirṇeṣyate /	Objection The question forms a subject of Adhyaya XI, and as such would be dealt with in that Chapter, under the Sütra, ēkadravye, eto XIiv and consequently it need not be taken up for C consideration, in the present connection.
ekadravye saṃskārāṇāṃ vyākhyātamekakarmalamityatrāta iha na vicāraṇīyam /	It is only when the Material is one, that there would be a single performance common to all the actious concerned specially in a case where it is in the same condition that the Material helps in all the actions the more so as, in such cases, we do not perceive any reason for making any difference in fact no such difference can ever be made.
ucyate /	may have been dis posed of, yet there could be a Disposal of another part of it.
pratipādyamidaṃ dravyaṃ bhedena sahate kriyām / khaṇḍaśaśca pradhānānāmaṅgatvānnāsti tantratā	Inasmuch as the exact places out of which the various offerings are cut out aro different, it is quite natural that there should be a differentiation into the Northern half, the Southern half, etc.,etc. Sutra The Remnant of each action not being dis tinguished, it would belong equally to all and hence there can be but one Disposal.
karmasaṃskārapakṣe hayamānasaṃskārapakṣe vā tahedāīdo bhavet /	That is to say, if the offerings in question were purificatory of the Sacrifice, or of the Material that is offered in Homa, then, the difference among the Sacrifices, and among the Materials, would have led to a diver sity in the offerings in question.
śeṣasaṃskārastvayaṃ sa ca śeṣa sādhāraṇastasya ca dakṣiṇottarārḍe gṛhyate / na pradhānāvadānadeśastasya prakṛtāvacoditatvāttataśca śakyamagṛhyamāṇaviśeṣatvaṃ vatam /	As a matter of fact, however, we find that they are purificatory of the Remnants and we also know full well that in the case in question, there is a single Remnant, common to all the Homas and it is the Northern and Southern halves of this common Remnant that are taken up for the offerings in question and they are not the parts of that slice which has been cut out and offered at the Princi pal Sacrifice, as no such parts have been spoken of in connection with the original Sacrifice and as such we can certainly assert the fact of its specifications not being cognized.
yadyapi hye kapradhānoddeśenottarāīṃ gṛhṇauyuḥ tathā 'pi tathā coditārthasaṃpattyā pradhānāntarāṇyapi kṛtārthāni bhaveyuḥ /	For if one could take up the Northern half for the sake of one of the Principal Sacrifices, that would suffice for the due fulfilment of what has been enjoined and hence the other Prin cipal Sacrifices also will come to have all their needs supplied by that very slice.
tasmāttantram /	For these reasons it must be admitted that the offerings in question are made only once, as common to all the Homas concerned.
yattu pratipādyaṃ vibhavatauti pratipacyantare catukaraṇe tadupayujyate /	As for the excesses left after the DisposalOfferings, they would be utilised in a subsequent DisposalOffering, f.i.
aindravāyave tu vacanātpratikarma bhakṣaḥ syāt	Sutra In the case of the Aindravayava, there should be an Eating with each action, because of a distinct declaration to that effect.
pūrvavadi dravyaikatvātmakṛikṣite kṛtaḥ śāstrārtha iti nyāyāt prāpte vacanād dirbhakṣaṇaṃ hiraindravāyavastha bhakṣayatīti / bhavanti cedvathānyapyadhikaraṇāni yeṣāṃ nyāyema pūrvapakṣaṃ kṛtvā vacanena siddhānto bhavati /	Though the proper place for this discussion would have been after Sutra , where the question of the Eating of Soma in general has been dealt with, yet it has been introduced here, simply because, being an excep tion to the conclusion of the foregoing Adhikaraṇa, this presents itself to us more quickly than the said general question. In view of a distinct Declaration that to the effect, Dviraindra vayavasya bhakṣayati,we must admit that the Remnant should be eaten twice. Though it is quite true that we have certain Adhikaranas where, as in the present case, the Purvapaksha is based upon reasoning, while the Sid dhanta in reply is based on Verbal Authority, yet that does not appear to be quite the proper method because in such cases no Doubt is possible.
ma tvetadyuktam /	Sutra There should be no Eating of Soma, as there is no Declaration to that effect.
saṃdehābhāvāttava vai tat kriyate yatra nyāyena pratipādito vavanād bādhitaḥ tadabhāvātmamānanyāyeṣūpakariṣyati /	Though among these also, the case of the Somas referred to in the sentences Sarvataḥpariharam Açvinam bhakşayati and the liko would be amenable to the same reasoning as that in regard to the Aindravāyava, yet with regard to these also, we have to consider the question as to whether these sentences merely serve the purpose of laying down qualifi cations with regard to the Bating whose performability is already fully recognized, or they lay down the qualified Bating itself.
tasmānnaivaṃ varṇanīyaṃ kiṃ tarhi tantravārtike / sarvapṛṣṭhāyāva pratikarma sviṣṭakṛdiḍaṃ karttavyaṃ pradhānabhedāt /	Question What difference does this make? Answer If these sentences themselves are also the Injunctions of the Eating, then this has to be done only in the cases specified in these sen tences while if the Injunction of the mere eating is got at elsewhere and the sentences quoted be the Injunction of mere qualifications, then, in that case, even though the Indicative Force of the words might point directly to only a part of the Soma, yet it would apply to all the Somus. In regard to this Question, then, there are three probable alternative.
tathā hi /	theories, viz.
some 'vacanāico na vidyate aindravāyave tāvaddiśiṣṭavidhānādapi bhakṣo bhavet athetaragrahagate camasasthe ca some saṃdehaḥ /	Inasmuch as the sentences that are found to serve the wholly different purposes of laying down qualifications, they stand in need of an Injunction, and as there is no Injunction, there can be no Eating or, those vory sentences may be taken as Injunctions, and accordingly, there is to be an Eating out of those vessels only that are specified in them or, there is to be an Eating, on the aforesaid grounds of the Name that is, given to the Caps and Vessels, as hotuccamasih and the like, the performing of the Vashatkāra, the Homa, and the Abhisava.
kiṃ bhakṣo 'sti neti tatvāpi sarvataḥ parihāramāśvinaṃ bhakṣyatītyādiṣu aindravāyavanyāya eva syāt /	, there would be no Remnant whence, then, could there be any Eating? The Eating can not be said to be implied by any Original Primary Sacrifice as the Jyotistoma, in which we have all the Vessels and Cups under con.
na cāva prakṛtitaḥ prāptirna ca pratyakṣopadeśo yo 'pyupadeśa iva so 'pyanyaparatvādasamarthaḥ /	sideration, is its own Original Primary. Nor do we find any direct In junction as to the Eating in question the Injunction that we have refers to a wholly different thing and as such, is incapable of laying down the Eating.
syādā 'nyārthadarśanāt	Sutra The Eating should be done because we find it mentioned in connection with the other pur posés.
vacanāni tvaparvatvāttasmādyathopadeśaṃ syuḥ	Sutra These sentences would be direct declara down some thing new and hence the Eatings should be in accordance with these Injunctions.
camaseṣu samākhyānātsaṃyogasya tannimittatvāt	Sutra Inasmuch as the Cups are named after the Priests, the Eating should be done by these, special ly as the connection of the name Camasa? is due to that Eating.
gṛhṇīma etadyathopadeśamiti sa tu samākhyādibhedabhinna upadeśo 'nusatavyaḥ na tu śrutaviśeṣamātraniṣṭhaḥ /	We admit that the Eating would be done, in accordance with the In junctions but these Injunctions are to be followed as qualified by the aforesaid Name, Vashatkära, etc., and not merely as mentioned in those sentences.
tatra camaseṣu tāvat yadyapi brāhmaṇagataḥ pratyakṣopadeśo nopalabhyate tathā 'pi praiṣagatayā samākhyayā 'numoyate hoṭacamasatvodiviśiṣṭaṃ hi dravyanayanapreṣaṇaṃ na kathaṃ cidupapadyate yadi teṣu hotrādayaḥ somaṃ na camanti /	Though in regard to the Cups, we do not find any direct Injunction in the Brahmanas of the Eating, yet such Injunctions are inferred from the names contained in the Directions Praitu hotuçcamasaḥ, etc., etc.. that is to say, we find the Directions for the fetching of the Material accompanied by such names as hotuçcamasa the Hotris Cup and the like and these names could not be applicable, if the Hotri and other priests did not actually Eat camanti out of these Cups.
camasa iti adanārthasya cameroṇādike 'dhikaraṇasādhane asanpratyaye kṛte praiṣavelāyāṃ bhūtabhaviṣyadvarttamānānāṃ kva citsaṃbandhe 'pekṣyamāṇe bhūtavarttamānayoradarśanādbhaviṣyattvamanumauyate /	Because the word camasa? is formed out of the Root cami to eat, with the Locative affix asan of the Unadi class the word being etymologically explained as camanti asmin ili, camasah and hence at the time that the Direction Praitu hotuçcama sah is heard, the name camasa indicates the connection with actual Eating, either in the past, or in the future, or in the present and as we do not perceive any Eating in the past or the present, we conclude that the Euting indicated is that in the future otherwise, the Direction, Praitu hotuccamasah, could not be carried into effect.
tasmāccamitavyaṃ hovādibhiḥ /	For these reasons, it must be admitted that there should be an Eating by the Hotri and other priests.

Nor can it be urged that the infringement would be exactly the same in the case of the Eating of Soma. Because in regard to the Soma, we have the distinct Declaration that there is no impurity attaching to the Eating of Soma.

Question Wherefore should there be any doubt in regard to the matter in question ? Answer The reason is this In the word Udgätrrnäm, we find a distinct incongruity in the significations of the basic word and the affix .e. the basic noun denotes naturally only one Udgätr Priest, while the affix deuotes plurality and hence it is only natural that there should be a doubt as to the acceptance of the signification of the one or the other.

Sutra All four should do it because of their con nection with the Sama Veda but for other spe cial reasons, it would pertain to some of them only. So long as a basic noun can be taken in its conventional signification as a complete word, we cannot accept its etymological signification.

That is to say, in ac cordance with the rules of Grammar, the word Audgãtra is explained as formed out of the word Udgatr with the nominal affix an and in no way could any rule explain the word Udgatr as the performer of the Audgätra functions, which would mean an elimination of the affix an in the word Udgätr. Consequently the name Udgătr cannot be taken as based upon the word Audgatra but it must regarded as based upon the actual appointment of the Priest as such, as will be explained later on.

In accordance with the lawnacēdanyēna çiṣṭāḥ? Iiv, so long as the qualification can, in some way or other, be taken as a mere des criptive reference, we cannot rightly take the sentence as a qualified Injunction and then, the character of the First is something that has not been got at by any other Injunction hence it is not possible for the Eating to be enjoined with reference to that consequently, the sentence must be construed asyo Vaşatkartuḥ bhakṣaḥ sa pratha mah The eating of the performer of the Vasatkära should be the first . Question Inasmuch as the Eating too has not been enjoined before, we cannot take that as mentioned merely by way of descriptive reference for the Injunction of First. Answer Inasmuch as the Injunction of the Eating is involved in the very name of the Cup belonging to the Vasatkarta, it is quite pos sible for it to be mentioned merely by way of descriptive reference. Reply Th does not matter as it is not necessary that what is spoken of by way of descriptive reference must have been recognized as to be performed in all cases as all descriptive references stand in need of only that much of recognition as is possible.
na hi prāksamāmāgacasya vaṣaṭkasaṃbandho yuktaḥ sāpekṣatve sati samāsānupapatteḥ /	But this is not admissible because proximity and remoteness are sought after only in cases where there is some sort of a contradiction.

Bak Objection We often find that even though the principal factor of the compound be dependent upon some extraneous factor, it forms part of a compound and hence in the case in question also, even though the Eating would be connected with the Vasatkarty, yet it could be compounded with prathamaḥ.” Reply It could be so, if the Eating were the only factor dependent on an extraneous factor in the present case, however, we find that the first also is so dependent, on account of the relationship of the Vasat kartr as the cause of the first is not the Eating, but the character of the Vaşatkartr and hence the syntactical connection would be Vasatkartur prathamah the first of the Vaşatkartr and that would involve a distinct incongruity. While, if we were to take the in junction of first as with reference to that which is the Eating of the Vaşaṭkartr yo Vaşatkarturbhakṣaḥ we would have the anomaly of having a qualified reference the reference being to the Eating quali fied by the Vaşatkartr as mere Eating could not indicate the Vaşatkartr and as for the character of the Vasatkarty that is found to be concomitant with actions other than the Eating and as such could not necessarily indicate it.

Consequently, the sentence must be taken as laying down the first Rating of the Vasatkartr. As a matter of fact, however, the Vasatkartrtva is not wholly incapable of being enjoined. Because the fact of the Vaşatkara being the causal condition is not signified by such agencies as the word yadi, the Locative ending, and the like but the fact is that the Vaşatkartr having been enjoined as accessory to an action, the fact of its being a causal condition is only implied.
taccāśakyaṃ katta mato vaṣaṭakarṭa prāthamyaviśiṣṭāpūrvabhakṣa vidhānametat /	Hence the objection urged above does not affect our theory. Objection In the sentence tasmādēkam sāmatrce kryate stotr yam, we find the three enjoined with referenco to the Rk, even though this occurs in a compound and in the same manner, we could have the Injunction of the First only.
tayośca parasparaniyamādatyantasamānaviṣayatvamato yāvati viṣaye vaṣaṭkārastāvatyeva prathamabhacaḥ / kathaṃ punarvaṣaṭakārī nimittabhūtaḥ sannupādīyate kathaṃ cānupādīyamānasya niyamo 'vakalpate /	But then what happens is that the whole three verses could be accepted as the object of the Injunction, if both the factors of the com pound were such as are not got at by other means but as a matter of fact, we find that the factor of the Rk is already got at by the general Injunction of Sama, as also by the order of the text and hence, in accord ance with the Sutra Iiv, they are not taken as enjoined by the sentence question whose injunctiveness is taken as restricted to the number three only. In the sentence Vasatkartuḥ prat hamabhakṣaḥ, we find that what is signified by the compound is enjoined only to the extent of the Vasatkara, and hence if, like the Rk in the case of the other sentence, the Eating of the present sentence also were already en joined and known as existing everywhere, then it would be abandoned by the Injunctive potency in the sentence.
ucyate /	Sūtra Homa and Abhisava also entitle to drink.
niyama sarvathā tāvadeka karmanimittakaḥ / upādānānupādāne na viśeṣaḥ pratīyate	Inasmuch as the actions Homa and Abhisava themselves, with all their accessories are already laid down elsewhere, they could not be taken as being enjoined by this sentence which, therefore, must be taken as laying down the Eating due to these actions.
mūlyaṃ prāpaṇavyayaśca = deyaḥ /	Objection Like the Dikşdvakya, the sentence might be taken as laying down the order in which the actions of Homa and Abhişava and Eating are to be performed.
anyairmahāśayaiyaiḥ kānicit khaṇḍāni saṃgrāhyāṇi teśca pratyekaṃ khaṇḍānā mūlyaṃ prāpaṇavyayaśca = deya iti	performance, due to an unnecessary increase in the number of the pass. ings from hand to hand otherwise inasmuch as it is the Adhvaryu who holds the Cup after the Homa has been offered, if he did not have the first Flating, but had to pass on the Cup to others, then it would be neces sary for the Cup to be offered back again to him for his own Eating out of it and then it would be passed on to others and this would involve a deal of unncessary disorder.

Objection The action of Pounding Abhisabha by the Adhvaryu preceded even that of the Vasatkara.” Reply True, it did appear before but that alone did not make it the prompting cause of the Eating of Remnants as it is the Pounding as taken along with the Homa that constitutes the prompting canse of the Eating, as will be shown under Sutra VIiv.
yadi punaryajamānādapanaya iti vyākhyāyeta tata stasya yājagrāmācaṃ prāpitaṃ sadapanauyataiti vaṣaṭkārādiprātyabhāvādapanayāśava na syāt /	The sense of the Sutra is that, in any case, the Invitation should not be conveyed by means of the words of ordinary parlance. Sūtra The words conveying the acceptance of the Invitation are implied in the same that have been quoted before. Sutra The Permission should be for those who eat out of the same vessel as it is only those that are associated together in that Eating. If the Permission herein laid down were such as had not been found elsewhere, then it might have been obtained from any person as a matter of fact however, we find that the Permission here restricted as to be given by means of Vedic words is only such as is generally found in ordinary life.
tasmādyajamānasya yājepratyanena yājagrāmātrāpanayāddaṣaṭkārasya ca yājāto 'tyantavyatirekā daṅgāṅgitvābhāvācca yajamānena prayujāmānāyā upari hotā vaṣaṭkṛtya bhakṣayet /	And hence its possibility could never be set aside in a case where it is found to exist. It is only among the priests cating out of the same vessel that the shares being equal in accordance with the Sutra Xi there are chances of differences arising and hence the Eating is to be done by mutual Permission or Agreement. Even though the Eating by one person would not cause any impurity in the Soma, and as such there is no imperceptible supersensuous harm done by such Eat ing, yet the fact of a number of people eating together out of the same vessel, is actually found to give rise to such perceptible disagreeable results, as the hurting of one anothers feelings and as such, there is, in such cases, a necessity for the said Permission. Hence it must be admitted that the Permission is necessary only for those eating out of the same vessel.
vaṣaṭkāranimitto hi bhakṣo na bājānimitta ityanapanītaḥ /	Sutra The transference of the Tajyāmantras from the Hotr does not transfer the Eating from him, just like the Appointment.

And in case he should do it himself, there arises the question as to whether, or not, this taking up, by the Sacrificer, of the Yajyarecitation which might have been done by the Hotr Priest, leads to the transference, from the Hotr, also of the per formance of the Vaşatkara, and the Eating consequent upon this latter.
vaṣaṭkāreṇa ca haviḥpradānārthatvādijyate na kevalayā yājyayā /	There can be no such transference of the Eating because there is no Vedic declaration to that effect and certainly the removal of one thing does not necessarily imply the transference of the other as there.
tathā inavānaṃ yajatoti yājyāta ārabhya yāvadyanaterarthaḥ samāpyate tāvannāvānitavyam /	That is to say before the appearance of the sentence the Yajya belongs to the Sacrificer, the name Hautra indicated all the three to belong to the Hotr and when the said sentence did appear, it trans ferred the Yajya only to the Sacrificer, and left the Vaşatkāra and Eating in the same position as before i.e.
ekakartṛkatve ca yājyāvaṣaṭkārayoridamupapadyate nānyathā / tasmāt yatra yājyā tatra vaṣaṭkārabhakṣāvapītyantaregā/ pyekatvamaṅgabhāvaṃ cāpanayo vijñāyate /	the Yājyä would be transferred from him and as such, there being no idea of the possibility of the Vasatkāra and the Eating belonging to him, such there could be no question as to whether these latter should be transferred from him or not. Consequently, we must explain thus The sentencethe Yajya belongs to the Sacrificerhaving transferred the Yajya only from the Hotr to the Sacrificer,the Vaşaṭkāra being something wholly distinct from the Yajya, and hence there being no possibility of the relationship between these two of the primary and the subsidiary a whole and part,the process adopted would be that after the sacrificer has finished the Yājyā, the Hotṛ would do the Vasatkāra and the consequent Eating.

anyathā hi teneti prāpnoti tasmātsaskāraḥ/	Because that which is declared in regard to one thing cannot set aside the Soma which is with regard to something else.

Though the actual word used in the sentence is the causative ‘yājayêt, yet the connection should be taken as being with the simple sacrifice, just as in the sentence grāmakāmām yajayēt because as for the subsidiary performer who would be the nominative of the causative yajuyët , he is already known, and not lead ing to any result, cannot form the object of Injunction.

That is to say though between the latter yājayēt and the former conditional declaration sa yadi, etc., we have the sentence sa yadi somam vibhakşayişèt, yet we take the former two as syntactically con nected, irrespective of the interruption. Though the Pronoun in tamasmai is, by direct declaration, known to have the power of referring to the person spoken of in the context, the above explanation would neces sitate the rejection of this power, as also the immediate sequence. The presence of the conditional if in the sentence sa yadi, etc., sets aside the injunctive potency of the sentence and hence it could not be taken as laying down the sacrifice as connected with the Phalacamasa unless we were to assume an injunctive potency in the sentence.
yahā aprotiṣṭomaprakaraṇena saṃbaddho 'yaṃ bhanaśabda uccāryyamāṇaḥ prakṛtaṃ somabhakṣamevāvalambate /	Thongh in the expression tamasmai, the word tam with the Accusative ending signifies the predominance of the eatingmaterial, yet that would be lost sight of and further, the word prayacchet being clearly found to have the character of the injunctive, it would not be correct to take it as a mere descriptive reference.

And the author of the sutra also has put forward the reason because all purification is for the sake of the sacrificial material, and not that because it is connec ted with yāyayet. And for these reasons we cannot admit the above explanation.
api ca sa yadi somaṃ vibhakṣayiṣediti svavākyopātta naiva somabhakṣaṇana saṃbandhī vijñāyate anyathā hi tadupādānaṃ vyartha meva syāt /	But this explanation also is open to the following objections All the Soma in the sacrifice would be replaced by the Phalacamasa the absence of connection of the Phalacamasa with the eating, which is expressed by the word tam and as such is cognized by means of the same sentence as the Phalacamasa itself and in that case there being no such connection, we could not explain the Masculine affix in tam as the Pronoun would apply to the nyagradhashthivih, which is not masculine and the tam would be construed along with praya cchet, notwithstanding the intervention of bhakşam the construction being tam yajayitum prayacchet .

And then, before it has been used, and thereby become capable of being purified by the eating of the sacrificer, it becomes related to the sacrificial portions, by means of the Apparent Inconsistency of its being eaten by the sacrificer and this fact having become duly ascertained, the Phalacamasa would be taken as forming the material for the repetition of the offering out of the Cup of the Sacrificer because the fact of its not being used in the other vessels or Cups would not interfere with its being eaten by the Sacrificer and it is only the apparent Inconsistency of this that has been made the ground of its connection with the sacrificial portions.

And if the sentence is construed as yềna bhakṣhaṇēna yathābhūtum somam samskartumicchët tēnu tāthābhūtumēva phalucamasam samskuryat one should purify, by eating, the Phalacamasa in the same character, and in the same way as he wishes to do with regard to the Soma, then, in that case, by Apparent Inconsistency, we would come to take it as the Phalacamasa na related to and forming the material for the repetition of the offering made out of the Cup of the sacrificer. For these reasons it must be admitted that the Phalacamasa constitutes a modification substitute for the Soma, as regards the offerings at the sacrifice.

The same reasoning holds respecting such sentences as putikama. bhisinuyat one should pound the putika, if Soma be unavailable and the rest where the putika is to be taken as laid down, not simply as an object to be pounded, but as one to be offered.
homāt	Sutra Because of the Homa.
homānuvādena darbhataruṇaka vidhirijyāvikāratve 'vakalpate / camasaiśca tulyakālatvāt	The Injunction of the kupasprout, with reference to the Homa of the material in the other cups in the sentence yada anyāṁçcamasān juhvati athaitasya darbhatarunakenopahutya juhvati, distinctly show, that the Phalacumasa is meant to be a substitute for the material to he offered at the sacrifice.
saṃdigdhayāgasādhanonnayanaikavākyatā caitattulyatve 'vakalpate nānyathāve / liṅgadarśanāca	Sūtra Because we find the Phalacamasa spoken of as to be held up at the same time as the other cups, It is only when the Phalacamasa is similar, in character, to the other cups, that we can explain the fact of its holding up being spoken of along with that of the other cups, with regard to which latter there is no doubt as to the materials contained in those being offered at the sacrifice.

kaḥ punaḥ saṃdeha hetuḥ ke cidāhuvacanavyaktibheda iti /	Question What is the ground for this doubt? In answer to this, some people put forward the diversity of construc tion that the sentences admit of.

Inasmuch as the word anuprasarpēyuḥ in the latter sentence has the Injunctive form, while the word bhakṣayanti in the former sentence has the descriptive form, we must take the sentence daça daçaikam as the Injunction and then there arising the question as to which ten should do the eating, we are led, by the fact of the number always pertaining to homogenous things, to conclude that the ating out of the Brāhmaṇacups should be done by ten Brāhmaṇas, while that out of the Rajanyacups, by ten Kṣāttriyas.

Hence we are led to the conclusion that the sacrificers cup, without being disjoined from the caste Kşattriya, should be connected with the number ten that is to say, it is the ten Kşattriyas that should eat out of the Rajanyacups.
nanu ca daśatve vidhauyamāne yadekaikaṃ camasamanuprasarpantoti viśiṣṭānuvādādākyaṃ bhidyate /	S Objection The sentence having laid down the number ten, inas much as the reference would be a qualified one, the sense of the Injunction being yadekaikam camasamanuprasarpanti, etc.,etc. i.e.
naiṣa doṣaḥ /	Sūtra The Brāhmaṇas should do it because of the same word.
camasamiti dvitīyāntaṃ kevalamanūdhate tābatā tu saṃskāryatvaṃ gamyate /	That is to say, the connection of the Brāhmaṇas with all the cups is shown by the same word Brāhmaṇa being used.
na ca camasānāṃ bhakṣaṇaṃ mukkā 'nyaḥ saṃskārastena sa evānuprasarpaṇaśabdena lakṣyate tatra ca pratyekameva bhakṣaṇaṃ prāptamiti tadapyanudyate /	Nor do we find any ground for taking the word Brāhmaṇa in its secondary senso as indicating the Kşattriya specially as we do not find the Kşattriya mentioned by any more authoritative means of knowledge and if the word were taken in the said indirect sense and the Injunctive character wero attributed to the sentence daça,etc. the whole of the sentence cutam Brāhmaṇaḥetc. would be a meaningless repetitiou while in accordance with our theory, the Injunctive potency of the sentence ‘çatum Brāhmaṇāḥ etc., being inferred from the nature of the declaration in regard to the performance of the sacrifice as a whole, it would enjoin the hundred Brah manas and this being done, the repetition contained in the sentenco daça, eto.
tasmānna vākyabhedaḥ /	and thus in this case, there would be no recourse to indirect secondary signification.
brāhmaṇā vā tulyaśabdatvāt	And as all the ten cups would be occupied by the hundred Brahmaņas, in ten parties of ten Brāhmaṇas each, there would be no room for any Ksattriya.
na vā rājanyā bhakṣayeyuḥ kutaḥ / śatabrāhmaṇasaṃyukto vidhiravāvagamyate /	Then again, inasmuch as the sentence ēkaikam,etc. could not be taken as a mere reference, in regard to the RajanyaCups, it would be taken as enjoining ten Kşattriyas, with regard to those cups while for the other cups, we have the Injunction of hundred Brāhmaṇus in the sentence Çatam Brāhmaṇaḥ, and we do not know how the nine cups are to be divided among the hundred Brahmaņas.
anyathā tadupādānaṃ gauṇaṃ vyarthaṃ ca te bhavet	Then if the reference be taken as to the unqualified eating, then we would have the number hundred applicable even to those eat ings that are done out of the aminal body, the cake,etc. in general.

And in this case, even though there would be an Injunction, yet it would have the char acter of Preclusion or, it might show that with regard to a single Cup there may be ten persons eating out of it or that with regard to a single Cup, ten parties of ten cating out of the same Cups in any case the eating out of the Cup would be done by hundred persons, in parties of ten each.

Nor would this extend to the case of the vessels also as the sentence daça, etc., refers distinctly to the Cups. Thus then, we find that, even as regards the RajanyaCups the In junction having pointed out the eating as to be done by the said party of ten,the place is taken up by the party of ten Brāhmaṇus, as shown above and thus the material in question having all its needs of purifica tion fulfilled by being eaten by these latter and thus being duly disposed of, it is the Sacrificer the Ksattriya who would have no eating to do. Thus it is established that it is ten Brahmanus that should eat out of the ten RajanyaCups.
śarairapi kuśāḥ prāptā eva bādhyantaityuktaṃ balābalādhikaraṇe /	Specially as the con nection of the Khudira with the Original Primary is far more easy and direct than that with the Modificatory Sacrifice.
tadyadi tāvadanārabhāvādānurodhana khādiratvādiviṣayo'tideśaḥ parityajyate tata evāṅgāntareṣvapauti sarvanivṛttiprasaṅgaḥ tatra coktam /	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the Injunction under consideration ‘pertains to all sacrifices and that the Implicatory Injunction applies to all other accessories except the KhadiraSruva. Sutra Reply It must pertain to the Original Primary because the object of the Implicatory Injunction is one complete whole and because the application of the Principal Direct Injunction, to the modification would be incompatible.
atha keṣāṃ cit prākatānāmanurodhena tadviṣayo 'tideśa pramāṇaṃ kriyate tataḥ khādiratvādiprāptirapya viśiṣṭeti sphuṭaṃ dviruktavaṃ prāpnoti / yāgagatavyāpārāpecilāñca khaprakaraṇāmnānamapyatikramya vikṛtayaḥ prākṛtaṃ tāvad gṛhṇantīti sarvatra sthāpayiṣyāmaḥ /	And this sacrificial operation, for its own accomplishment, takes up, all at once, all the Apūrvas relating to the Prayajas these Aparvas, in their term, take up the Prayāja and the rest and these latter take up their own Injunctive texts in the shape of the Implicatory Injunction. Thus then, the Implicatory Injunction, in the form of Prakrtivad virktiḥ kartavyābeing one only, it would apply or not apply, equally to all accessories, and not to portions of these. In the case of the substitution of the Cara for Kuça also, what the Direct Injunction sets aside is the Kuça, whose existence has been already pointed ont by the Implicatory Injunction, as we have already shown under the Adhikaraṇa dealing with the comparative authoritative strength of Direct Declaration,etc. Thus then, if, in consideration of the Direct Injunction under question, the Implicatory Injunction be set aside from the factor of the Khadira Sruva, then it would cease to apply to the other accessories also and that would lead to the total rejection of all the accessories of the Pri mary sacrifice in the Modification.

It is for this rea son that it is necessary to admit the priority of the functioning of the Im plicatory Injunction to that of the Injunction that does not occur in the context of any sacrifice. And further, it is absolutely necessary to seek for an injunction of the Sruva, in connection with the Modifications and the effort that would be necessary for getting at the Injunction of the Sruva would be suffi cient for that of the Khadira wood also and so this latter need not neces sarily be taken as forming the object of a Direct Injunction in connection with the Modifications.
na caiṣāṃ kratusaṃbandhī vispaṣṭaḥ /	Nor is the connection, with the sacrifice of such Injunctions as those under consideration, very distinctly perceptible.

sarvārthatvavādī ca prakṛtisaṃbandhaṃ tāvadabhyupagacchati /	But one who takes the Injunction under consideration to apply to all sucrifices accepts the existence of a certain connection of it with a sacrifice.
tena ca parihṛte śrānarthakye vikṛtisaṃbandhī niṣpramāṇakaḥ /	there would be no Apparent Inconsistency of the Injunction that could justify us in connecting the Injunction with the Modifications.
pramāṇavattaro hyatideśena kratusaṃvandhaḥ yeṣāṃ tu kratusaṃbandha eva pratyakṣaste 'nāramyavādā api sarvārthā eva / yathaiṣa vai prajāpatiḥ saptadaśo yajñe 'nvāyatta ityevamādayastasmāt khādiratvādi prakṛtyarthamiti siddham /	While, on the other hand, the connection of the Injunction with a sacrifice established by the Implicatory Injunction is based upon a very much stronger au thority. Those Injunctions not occurring in the context of any particular sacrifice, whose connection with sacrifices is distinctly perceptible, would always pertain to all Sacrifices, even though they may not be found in the context of any particular Sacrifice just as we find in the case of such sent ences asEşa vai Prajapatiḥ saptudaço yajnē nvāyattaḥ. Thus then it must be admitted that the Khadirawood,etc. .
prakaraṇaviśeṣāttu vikṛtau vi rodhi syāt tantravārtike/	Sūtra The number being contrary to that of the Ori ginal Primary, it would apply to the Modification specially on account of the particular Context.

kathaṃ punaḥ prākaraṇikena viśeṣavidhinā sahātulyabalasya vikalpo 'bhidhīyate /	Question How can that which is laid down by an Injunction, not occurring in the Context of the Primary sacrifice, and which is weaker in authority, be taken as an optional alternative to that which is parti cularly laid down in the same Context with it.
pratyakṣo yatra saṃbandho viśeṣeṇa pratīyate	? Answer The Particular sets aside the General, only in cases where the Particular denotes a distinctly preceptible connection.
sāmidhenau svarūpa prayuktatve 'narthikā saṃkhyetyavaśyaṃ yāgāpūrvasāghanatvakāritaḥ saṃbandho 'bhyupagantavyaḥ / na ca yāgāpūrvasāghanatvaṃ prakaraṇāhate lacayituṃ śakyate iti navame vacyāmaḥ /	To the above, we make the following reply Even though both the numbers are equally related to the Samidhenis, yet, inasmuch as there is a distinct difference in the degrees of their relationship to the Sacrifice, the two cannot be taken as optional alternatives. The mention of number not being of any use, in connection with the Samidhenis only, we must take its relationship to the Sacrifice based upon the fact of its helping in the accomplishment of the sacrificial Apurva and this fact of helping in the accomplishment of the sacrificial Apurva cannot be indicated by any other means, save by the Context, as we shall show in Adhyaya IX.
tena prakaraṇānugraha viśeṣātyāñcadaśyamapūrvasaṃbandhapramāṇapratyāsattaṃ rbalauya / vidhirapi hi pūrva prayojanavati puruṣaṃ niyute sāptadaśyāca pāñcadaśyaṃ śīghrata prayojanavadavaghāryataiti vidhikālavaiṣamyādatulyabalatvam tṛtīyādhyāyasya ṣaṣṭhaḥ pāda /	Thus we find that the connection of the number fifteen is much more authoritative than the Syntactical Connection, on account of the former being more nearly connected with the sacrificial Apürva. An Injunction always, in the first instance, prompts the person to that cause of action which serves a distinctly useful purpose and in the case in question, there is no doubt that fifteen is more directly and easily recoginsed as useful because of its direct relationship to the sacrificial Apurra and hence, there being a difference in the time of the appear ance of the Injunctions relating to the two numbers, they cannot be re garded as equally authoritative.
api ca kratumaviguṇaṃ kartta puruṣaḥ pravarttate na sāmidhenī /	Then again, the action of man is calculated to perform the sacri fice in such a way as not to leave it doficient in any point and it is not meant to give ont perfect Samidhenis.
kratvaṅgatve ca sāptadaśyasya na kiṃ cit śrutyādi pramāṇamupalabhāmahe yathā pāñcadaśyasya prakaraṇam / tasmādetatpāñcadṛśyaṃ sāmidhenīnāṃ darśapūrṇamāsayośca vākyaprakaraṇābhyāmavadhāryate /	And thus we come to the conclusion that the number fifteen belongs to the Samidhenis as well as to the Ducçapūrṇamāsa sacrifices, as pointed out by Syntactical Connection and Context respcc tively whereas the number seventeen pertains to the Sāmidhēnis only as pointed out by the sentence under consideration and with a view to set aside the apparent uselessness of this latter number, wo could have assumed its connection with the sacrifice,just as in the case of the Khadiragruva,if the sacrifice had stood in need of such a connection as a matter of fact however, we find that the sacrifice has its requirements already supplied by the mention of another number fifteen and as such it does not stand in need of the connection of any other number Thus we find that the Samidhenis have their deficiency supplied by means of both the numbers fifteen and seventeen while the sacrifice has its wants fulfilled by the number fifteen only.
yadi tvasau pratīcchenna tvasau saṃkhyāntarāvaruḍaḥ san pratīcchati /	We find that even if the accessory attendant upon the subordinate factor were to.

tasmātkratvavaṣṭambhadarpitena pāñcadaśyenotkālitaṃ sāptadaśyaṃ kliṣṭena yāvadatideśena pāñcadaśyaṃ naiva vika tīḥ prāpnoti tāvadopadeśikena sāptadaśyena prathamatarāvaruḍatvāttābhyo nirākṛtaṃ kevalaprakṛtiviṣayatvenaivāvadhāryate iti vyavasthāyāmuktāyāmucyate /	Thus then we find that the number seventeen is precluded from all connection with the sacrifice, by the number fifteen, which latter is strong in its prior relationship to the sacrifice and as for the modifica tions of that sacrifice, while the namber fifteen will be still on its way to being connected with them, by the extremely roundabout agency of the Implicatory Injunction Prakrtivadvikrtiḥ, etc.,they would, long ere this, become connected with the number seventeen, which is men tioned in the Direct Injunction and thus fifteen, being thrown aside from these modifications, comes to be recognised as pertaining to the Original Primary sacrifice only.
na sāptadaśyaṃ balavadhikṛtiṣvaupadeśikam / anārabhyavidhestaddhi sāmidhenyaṅṅgatāṃ gatam	In regard to the above differentiation however, we have got to say something and it is this The directly enjoined soventeon has no greater authority for pertaining to the modifications, as all that the Direct Injunction under considérationwhich does not occur in the Context of any particular sacrificeshows is that the number seventeen belongs to the Samidhënis and as for the modifications taking the number seven teen, there appears to be no authority whatever.
yathā prakaraṇa prāptaṃ prakṛtī balavattaram / tathā 'tideśavijñātaṃ kratvaṅgavikṛtiṣvapi	In fact it is the fifteen that is shown to pertain to the modifications also, by the Implicatory In junction. And hence just as the connection of fifteen with the Original Primary, is based upon the superior authority of the Context, so too would its connection with the modifications be,being applied to these, as it is, by means of the Implicatory Injunction.
vāṅgena pāñcadaśyena vyāptīstā hyatideśataḥ / vihitaṃ sāmidheyaṅgaṃ sāptadaśyaṃ na gṛgahate	And it does not enter into all the Modifications, on the sole strength of the fact of its Injunction not occur ring in the context of any particular sacrifice because in regard to the Modifications other than the Paçu, the Mitravinda, etc., its entrance would be blocked by the prior entrance of the number fifteen as all these would be pervaded by this latter number, on the authority of the Implica tory Injunction and as such they could not take up the seventeen which is laid down only as belonging to the Samidhenis.
sūtrakāro'pi vikatau virodhīti yadabravīt /	The author of the Sutra also has used the words Vikṛtam, virodhi which shows that all that he meant was that the seventeen did not per tain to the Original Primary.
praka tau naitadastīti tadetāvadvivakṣayā to yadyapi daurbalyaṃ vākyātprakaraṇasya naḥ /	of pointing out that which is to be done in connection with the sacrifice, It is only when both of these apply to the same object that the former is weaker in authority than Syntactical Connection. As regards the sacrifice however, inasmuch as the Syntactical Connection as not apply ing to the sacrifice would not be contrary to the Context, it would not reject this latter.
tathā 'pi viṣayānyatvātkratau tahiniyojakam	Specially as the difference between the two is that the number fifteen is specifically singled out as pertaining to the sacrifice.
viśeṣaścāyamevāsya yadasādhāraṇaṃ kratoḥ /	Sūtra All that is ‘conditional finds place in the Original Primary as it brings about a change only on account of the special relationship of the Original Primary with the condition.
sāmidhenauṣa tulyatve śeṣatve vākyakalpite naimittikaṃ tu prakṛtau taḍikāra saṃyogaviśeṣāt	Because until the original nitya number fifteen were set aside, the conditional Naimit tika, due to certain specified conditions seventeen could not obtain a footing, as we find this latter to have been enjoined in the face of the fact of all the number fifteen appertaining to all performances of the action in question.
yadvaiśyādinimittana sāptadaśyaṃ vidhīyate / tantu syātpraka, tāveva pāñcadaśyasya bādhakam pāñcadaśyamabādhitvā hyātmānaṃ na labheta tat /	While on the other hand, inasmuch as the seventeen has been laid down only with regard to that performance which is done by the Vaiçya, the original number fifteen has a place in the perform ances of the Brahmana and the Kşattriya, in which latter we could have the number fifteen without setting aside the conditionally enjoined seventeen and hence the Injunction of fifteen would not justify the rejection of seventeen, while that of the latter could not but lead to the rejection of that with regard to fifteen, specially in connection with those cases where the action is performed by the Vaicya.
prayogāḥ santi tasyānye viprarājanyakartṛkāḥ /	junctions, the two numbers cannot be regarded as optional alternatives.
sāptadaśyamabādhitvā yeṣvātmā tena labhāte nekatraikena saṅkhyātāḥ saṅkhyāyante pareṇa tāḥ / nityasya bādhaśakirhi nārthāpattyā va kalpate	Nor could the two be used conjointly, at one and the same time because both serve the same purpose, with regard to the Samidhēnis as at any one performance, when these Samidhenis are recited as qualified by one number fifteen f.c., they could not, at the same time, be qualified by the other number seventeen . Nor can the Original Nitya, pertaining to all performances in general number fifteen be taken as having the potency of setting aside the other, on the ground of Apparent Inconsistency as it has its place in the performances not touched by the specified conditions.
asañjātavirodhaṃ hi nityaṃ sarvaṃ vidhīyate /	And the reasons for this are as follows At the time that the Nitya is enjoined, it has no opposing factor which it would have to set aside to obtain a footing for itself while as for the Naimittika this is always enjoined with reference to something that is already per vaded over by the previously enjoined Nitya and as such it always comes into existence in opposition to this latter and when there is this opposition, due to the fact of both the Injunctions referring to the same object, it is the Nitya that is always set aside by the other.
naimittika tu tadyāptaviṣayatvāviruṣyate	And inasmuch as the opposition does not appear simultaneously with re gard to both, both cannot be accepted as optional alternatives.
kica prayogasāmānye nityaṃ sarva vidhīyate / naimittika viśeṣe tu tammāttailavattaram	All the Nitya accessories are enjoined with regard to the performance in general of the action whereas the Naimittika is enjoined with regard to a particular performance and for this reason also, this Intter, being the more authoritative of the two, always sets aside the former.
kāmyanaimittikānāṃ tu vākyopāttaṃ prayojanam /	The in junction of the Nitya accessories is always prompted by due to the remote Apurva of the Principal Action and the highest authority for that Apūrva has been found to lie in the indications of Context where as for the Kamya and Naimittika accessories, we have the prompting cause mentioned in the same sentence and as such being more quickly prompted by the quick functioning authority of Syntactical Connection, these latter always set aside the former.
ataḥ śīghra prayuktatvānnityāta balavattarāḥ śrutyeva puruṣārthe hi śīghraṃ karttā pravarttate / naimittike hi ṭūrasthe cireṇāsau pravarttate pūrvādhikaraṇa naiva pūrvapakṣo 'tra sūvitaḥ /	A Then again, as between the Kämya and the Naimittika, it is the for mer that is possessed of greater authority, and as such sets aside the lat ter because the former is more nearly related to the end desired by man, while the latter has its result remote from itself and because the former is much quicker in its functioning than the latter because as regards an action cognised as bringing about an end desired by man, the man is quickly prompted to its performance by Direct Declaration itself whereas in regard to the Naimittika, inasmuch as the result is found to be remote, the prompting of the man takes some time. Thus then, though it was the Naimittika that was spoken of in the Sutra, yet the Bhasya has dealt with the Kamya only and the reason for this is that both the Naimittika and the Kamya are equally contrary to the Nitya while there is no contradiction between the Naimittika and the Kamya.
nityasyāsti viśeṣo hi kāmyātprakaraṇe yataḥ	In the case in question, there is one point of difference between the Nitya and the Kamya, viz.
bādhyeta phalalobhena nityaṃ kāmyena tava cet /	Then, it might be urged that, through a desire for the desirable result, the Kamya would always set aside the Nitya.
paśyato madhu durbuherbinipātastato bhavet	But such a course would lead to the same disastrous results as in the case of the fool who fell upon the beehive, being led to it by a sight of the Honey and not noticing the bees.
āśrayastādṛśo hoṣṭo yādṛśaḥ praka taḥ kratuḥ /	As for the sacrifice, it is found to be more intimately related to the Context, and to that which is laid down for its own sake and for this reason, it always takes up that which is for its own sake i.e.,.
khādiratvādibhirnityairvyāptaścāsau pratīyate	the Kōmya and as such that which is indicated by the Context i.e. the Nitya accessory is possessed of authority superior to that of one which is connected with the Result i.e.
tena gṛhṇāti hi svārthaṃ na tu kāmyaṃ kathaṃ cana /	the Kāmya specially as tha Context is found capable of pointing to the employment of the Kāmye accessory.
tvarthayo'pyasya svārtharūḍo na labhyate /	Lastly, it is not possible for the Kimya to obtain a sistrate that would be for the sake of the Sacrifice and not for that of Man only as such a substrate is already pervaded over by its own Nitya acces sories.
pūrvādhikaraṇanyāyastasmānnaimittikeṣvapi	To the above we make the following reply The Naimittika Condi tional always pertains to the Original Primary, setting aside the Nitya reasons for which we have already been shown before Teat.
asaṃyogādavādhana saṃyogo 'sya viśiṣyate /	The only ground for the Naimittika not setting aside the Nitya is nonconnection as has been shown to be the case with the Injunction not appearing in the Context of any action.
punaḥ karṭa viśiṣṭasya prayogasya parigrahāt	In the case in question however, we find a distinct connection of a performance qualified by a particular performer the Vaiçya,a performance which, being calculated to ac complish a desirable end of Man, is not capable of betaking itself to any other substrate. The superior anthority of the Naimittika being thus established, it must be admitted that it pertains to the Original Primary Sacrifice.
na tvatulyārthayorvādhaḥ kratvarthapuruṣārdhayoḥ /	Objection It is not proper to assert the rejection of that which is for the sake of the Sacrifice the Nitya by that which is for the sake of “Man i.e.
na yukto na virodho 'sti bhinnagocarayostayoḥ	the Kāmya, when these two do not pertain to the same object because when they pertain to two different objects, there can be no oppo sition between them.
na sādhayati paśvādona kratvarthaścamaso yathā /	And just as the Cup, which helps the sacrifice, does not accomplish such desirable results as Cattle and the like,so, in the same manner, the Milking Vessel, which helps in the accomplishment of a different purpose in the shape of some end desir Nor able by man, can never help in the fulfilment of the sacrifice.
godohanaṃ tathā 'nyārthaṃ na kratvarthasya sādhanam anyā hi vacanavyaktiḥ phaloddeśena taddidhau /	Nor is there any Injunction syntactically connecting the Result and the Fetching whereby the syntactical split could be avoided because the syntactical construction of the sentence would be totally different in the case of its being an Injunction of the Fetching with reference to the Result, from what it would be in the case of its being an Injunction of the Result with reference to the Fetching and hence the sentence could not be taken as enjoining both simultaneously without involving a syntactical split.
anyā praṇayanoddeśe tasmānna iyasaṃbhavaḥ	Specially as the connection of two remote factors is not admissible, unless that of the proximate ones is found quite impos sible and hence of the Fetching there could not be at one and the same time, possibility as well as impossibility.
ataḥ kamipadākṣepānnāsya praṇayane vidhiḥ /	For these reasons it must be admitted that, inasmuch as in the sentence gadohëna paçukāmasya praṇayēt, the Injunction is found to be taken up by the word Kāma` desiring, the sentence cannot serve as an Injunction of the Milking Vessel with reference to the Fetching and hence not being enjoined, and as such not having the character of the sacrificial accessory, it con not set aside the use of the Cup which is a sacrificial accessory.
avidhānādaśeṣatvānna śeṣāntaravādhanam tena praṇayanābhyāsaḥ kārya kāmyaguṇaṃ prati /tantravārtika / yathendra vāyudaivatye graho mitrādyasaṃbhavāt	the Cup, there can be no room for any other in the shape of the Milking Vessel. Conse quently in view of the accessory Milking Vessel that is laid down with reference to a particular desirable end, it would be necessary to repent the action of Fetching as the Fetching by means of the Oup would also have to be done. Just as in the case of the Vessel dedicated to India Vayu, inasmuch as the connection of Mitävarunna and other deities with that Vessol is not possible, the Injunction Muitrāvaruṇan gṛhṇāti, etc., is taken as laying down further repetitions of the Vessel,so, in the same we would have the repetition of Fetching, with a view to the par ticular Result desired by Man.
iyoretramavaiguṇyaṃ kratośca syātphalasya ca /	This would have the further advantage of causing no discrepancy, either in the Sacrifice, or in the Result desired by the Agent.
ṛtvarthaṃ karma gṛhṇāti sa eva svārthasiddhaye /	betakes itself, for the accomplishment of its own purpose, to that action which does help in the accomplishment of the Sacrifice.
nirvyāpāro guṇaḥ kāmaṃ na sādhayati kaścana sāca prakaraṇenāmmai dattā praṇayanātmikā / tayāṃ ca camasaḥ pūrvaprāpto 'nyo vidyate guṇaḥ tadavādhena naiveha tasya kaścidvidhi śrutaḥ /	Because an Acces sory, wholly devoid of functioning, could never fulfil any desirable result as when devoid of functioning, it can have no Instrumentality towards the fulfilment of that result consequently it is absolutely necessary for it to have taken up a certain Action or functioning which is authorised by the Scriptures and in the case in question, we find that the Accessory is supplied with such an action, in the shape of the Fetching. But then, we find that in regard to this action of Fetching, there is already an en joined accessory in the shape of the Cup and inasmuch as this cannot be set aside, there can be no Injunction of the Milking Vessel,etc. We find that the Cup has been laid down without any view to the rejection of the Milking Vessel but of this latter, we do not find any Injunction, without the rejection of the Cup.
kāmyena gṛhyamāṇā ca kriyā praṇayanātmikā	The action of Fetching too is taken up by the Accessory pertaining to the desirable result and hence it could not keep up its own Original Accessory, which is remote from the desirable Result.
karaṇe tasya doṣaḥ syānniṣiddhasyeva saṃgatī / bhinna prayojano'pi hi kāmyo guṇo 'vāntarakāryaikatvādvirodhiguṇāntarajñāna mithyātvāvadhāraṇa samarthaḥ /	Then again the nonacceptance of the original Nitya accessory would constitute an excellence while its acceptance would be a defect just as in the case of the connection of what is dis tinctly prohibited. deteta Even though the Accessory Milking Vessel. laid down with a view to a desirable result, serves quite a distinct purpose from what is served by the Nitya Accessory, yet, on account of the intermediate action Fetch iny being the same, it is capable of establishing the falsity of i.e. reject ing the idea of the other accessory i.e.
tathā hi /	the Cup.
prāmāṅgakoṃ kratoḥ siddhiṃ kāmyo hi kurute guṇaḥ /	Because the Kāmya accessory Milking Vessel also brings about the accomplishment of the Sacrifice, though indirectly i.e.
gṛhṇanti na ca siddhārthāḥ kratavaḥ svaguṇaṃ tadā	as the means of accomplishing the result for which the Accessory is laid down aud in that case, the Sacrifice, hav ing its purpose served by that, does not take up its original Nitya Ac cessory Cup as all things take up their Accessories only for the sake of certain purposes served by them and hence when that purpose has been served by an Accessory, which, in reality, had been meant for another purpose the bringing about, through the Sacrifice, of a certain desirable result, what would be the use of taking up the original Accessory at all? Thus then, in the case in question, the Fetching of water, that is done for the purpose of the Kneading, etc., of the sacrificial material, having been accomplished by means of the Kamya Accessory the Milking Vessel would not lead to the bringing in of its original Accessory the Cup, and hence the Cup cannot be regarded as an Accessory of that perform ance of the Fetching of water which is done with a view to the obtaining of Cattle and under the circumstance, the nonemployment of the Cup Thus, then, there could not be a repetition of the Fetching for the sake of the employment of the Cup, even for the sake of the Sacrifice itself as any such repetition would be absolutely useless and hence in one performance, at least, of the Sacrifice, there would be a rejection of the Nitya accessory.
haviḥsaṃyavanārthānāmapāṃ praṇayanaṃ hi yat /	Because it is only when the Fetching is actually accom plished that it serves as the substrate of the use of the Milking Vessel.
tad gṛhotvā guṇaḥ kāmyaḥ prayuṅgena kriyāntaram tena praṇayanābhyāsaḥ kratvartho'pi na vidyate /	Consequently, in course of that performance of the Sacrifice which is done with a view to the obtaining of Cattle, the Fetching, having been accom plished by means of the Milking Vessel, which has laid down for it a pur pose other than the mere accomplishment of the Sacrifice,could not take up the Cup. Because in all cases, the accessories are taken up for the accomplishment of certain actions, and not for the bringing in of the mere presence of the accessories themselves.
niṣphalatvādato vādhaḥ prayogātkamā sakṛt prayogamātre hi camaso godohanaṃ viśeṣe pūrvaprāptasvāsau tadabādhena labdhātmā naivaṃ godohanaṃ sāvakāśa tantradhārtika /	Question How is it that the injunction of the Milking Vessel is possessed of an authority superior to that of the Cup ? Answer Because the Milking Vessel has been laid down as a special case and hence its Injunction would become absolutely useless, if even in that particular case, we were to employ the Cup only and because it is enjoined in proximity to a result desired by man therefore it sets aside the use of the Cup. That is to say, and the Injunction of the employment of the Cup is a general one, indicating the possibility of its employment in all performances of the Fetching of water while that of the Milking Ves sel is a particular one laying it down as to be employed under certain conditions and hence it is possible for the former to have a place with out necessarily setting aside the latter i.e.
cāsau netarat dūre cāsau puruṣārthasya godohanaṃ tu saṃnikṛṣṭārthaṃ puruṣārthā ca sarvaśāstrapravṛttiḥ /	This however is not possible for the Milking Vessel, which can find no place without setting aside the Cup as this latter is connected with all performances. The Cup is very much farther removed from the result desired by Man, than the Milking Vessel whose use is directly connected with the acquiring of Cattle and it is a wellknown fact that all Scripture tends towards the fulfilment of some end desired by Man.
yaśca tādardhyātādakato viśeṣo nāsau tantramiti vaccati arthasyavikatatvāditi / mando hyaṣa viśeṣaḥ kratvarthenaiva kratvartho viśeṣādivihitena bādhitavyo nānyārtheneti /	As for the difference between the two the Cap and the Milking Ves sel, consisting in the fact of one serving the sacrifice, which the other does not, that has got nothing to do with the case in question as we shall show under Sutra, ‘ Arthasyävikṛtatvāt nor is there much use in such specialisations as, that a generic accessory helping in the sacrifice can be set aside by a particular one only when this latter also is such as helps in the sacrifice.
tenobhayoḥ sannidhivaśātparasparaśaktivilopānniyama /	And thus, on account of proximity, the two the Fetching and the Milking Vessel must be regarded as affecting each others potency and thereby restricting the utility or applicability of each other.
praṇayanasyāpyanyatra prayoge siḍātmakasya svasādhanopasaṃhāraśaktilopa godohanasyāpi praṇayanāntarakalpanāśaktivighātaḥ /	For instance, the Fetching which has obtained its existence in another per formance, loses its potency of bringing in its original accessory the Cup while the Milking Vessel also loses the potency of prompting any other Fetching.
paśukāmaprayogavyatiriteṣveva camamasya śāstrīyatvaṃ tasmāttahikārī goṭohanam /	And thus, it is only in such performances of the Fetching, as are not related to a desire for Cattle, that the employment of the Cup could be accepted as authorised by the Scripture and hence it must be admitted that the Milking Vessel which is laid down as to be used in perform ances connected with that desire is a modification of the Cup.
tena prakṛtāvevaitadvikārakamiti /	Hence we conclude that the Modification of the Cup, in the shape of the Milking Vessel is employed at the Original Primary only.
iṣṭārthamagnyādheyaṃ prakaraṇāt	Sūtra The laying of fire is for the sake of the Isti because of the Context.
anārabhyavādaprastāvenāgnyādheyasya prathamaṃ tāvadanārabhyavādatvameva pratipādyate prakaragona tāvatpavamāneṭārthatvaṃ prāpnoti/	In course of the treatment of such Injunctions as do not occur in the Context of any Sacrifice, the Author first of all proceeds to show that the Laying of Fire is enjoined without reference to any particular Sacri fice.
śuddhā gnyarthatve ca niṣprayojanatvāttaddāregauvāgnyādhānagrahaṇa sāmarthyaṃ tasmādiṣṭayarthaṃ sāmānyābhidhānam / api ca prakaraṇādeva pavamāneṣṭiviṣayaṃ draṣṭavyam /	The fact of the Injunction of the Laying of Fire Vasantē Agnīnāda dhita occurring in the Context of the Pavamānēṣṭi which is laid down in the sentence Agnaye pavumānāyāṣṭika palannirvapět,etc. indicates that the said Laying belongs to that Isti while from Direct Declaration it appears to pertain to the Sacrificial Fire purely by itself and not as connected with any particular Sacrifice hence there arises the question as to whether, or not, the Laying of Fire belongs to the Pavamānēṣṭi in particular.
na vā tāsāntadarthatvāt	Sūtru not so as it is the Ishtis that are for the sake of the Laying of Fire.
yadyārādupakārakamādhānaṃ bhavettataḥ prakaraṇādiṣṭyarthamiti gamyeta vākyasaṃyogātta, dvitīyānirdiṣṭā gnisaṃskārārthametadevaṃ ca sati yadyagnayaḥ pavamāneṣṭārthā bhaveyastatastareṇādhānamapi tadarthaṃ bhavet /	If the Laying were meant to be an indirect aid to a Sacrifice, then, through Context, it could have been taken as being for the sake of the İşti. Through Syntactical Connection, however, we find that the Accusa tive ending in Agnin adadhita clearly shows that the Laying is meant to be a purification of Agni.
tenaivaṃ punarnavaṃ karotīti cāgnisaṃskārārthatāṃ darśayati /	Under the circumstances, if the Ayni were solely for the sake of the Parumānēṣṭi then, in that case, through the Agni, the Laying also would be for the sake of that.
tatprakṛtyarthaṃ yathā 'nye 'nārabhyavādāḥ siddhe 'nāramyavādanave khādiratvādivadeva prakṛtyarthattvamagnihāreṇa prakṛtyanupraveśāt /	But we have already shown that not bringing about any definite results, the Isfis themselves are for the sake of subservient to the Agni and hence, in accordance with the Sutra VIiv, the Laying and the Işti could not bear the relation of subserviency to each other as both are accessories of Agni. Nor have we any reasons for making the Context set aside the denotation of the Accusative ending. Sutra Also because we find indications to the effect.
sarvārthaṃ vā ''dhānasya svakālatvāt	Sūtra It is for the sake of all sacrifices because the Laying has its own specific time distinctly sub joined .

tathā cānuṣṭhānasādhāraṇya masyaikādaśe vaccati dravyasyākakālaniṣpatteḥ prayogaḥ sarvārtha syāditi /	Specially as the fact of the performance of the Laying being common to all sacrifices will be fully established, under Sutra XIiii.
tatra ca pradhānavaśavarttitvāisante pūrṇamāsyamāvāsyayośca kriyeta tathā ca sati vasante paurṇamāsyāmamāvāsyāyāmādadhītantravārtike/	If it were for the sake of the Original Primary alone, then its performance would belong only to the Darça Purnamasa and in that case, inasmuch as its performance would depend upon that of this Principal Sacrifice, it would from its very nature come to be performed in its own time in the Vasanta, as well as on the Amamasya and the Pūrṇamāsi days. And in that case, such declarations, as Vasante adadhita, DarçaPürnamāsya yorādadhita, would become absolutely useless.
tetyetāni vacanānyanarthakāni bhaveyuktasmātsarvārthatvamiti /	For these reasons, it must be admitted that the Laying is for the sake of all Sucrifices.
na vetadyuktam / na hyādhānasya prakṛtyā vikṛtyā vā saṃ bandhe kiṃ citpramāṇamasti prakaraṇe sati yatpavamāneṣṭārthaṃ na jātaṃ tahinaiva śrutyādiṣaṭake nānyakarmārthaṃ bhaviṣyatīti kuta etat /	This position however could not be maintained, because we have no authority for connecting the Laying either with the Original Primary, or with the Secondary Modifications. We have found that, notwithstand ing the indications of the Context, the Laying was not admitted to be for the sake of the Pavamaneşti and then, how could we take it to be for the sake of any other Sacrifice, when we have none of the six means of knowledge Direct Declaration and the rost,pointing to that fact? Objection In that case, the present Adhikarana will have been in cluded in the last and as such there would be no need of treating of it separately.
nanvevaṃ sati pūrvādhikaragonaiva gatametat /	Reply True, it would certainly have been included in it, if the Darça Purnamāsa also were as devoid of results as the Paramâneşti.
teṣāṃ tu phalavattvādguṇānāṃ ca parārthatvādityeṣa nyāyo nāstīti śakyamagnihāreṇa ka maṅgatvaṃ kalpayituṃ niṣphalasyādhīnasyāvaśyakalpanīye prayojane 'gnihāreṇa khādirattvādivatkammarthatvamāpadyate /	As a matter of fact, however, the DarçaPärnamäsa are found to lead to dis tinct results and as such not being a subsidiary action, it could not be subject to the law of the Sutra VIiv and hence it is quite possible for the Laying to be taken as being, through Agni, for the sake of this Sacrifice. The Laying being devoid of any results of its own, it becomes necessary to find out some use for its performance and just as in the case of the KhadiraSruva, so in this also, the Laying would come to be recognised as being, through Agni, for the sake of the Sacrifice.
śaknuvanti hi prayogamadhyasthā vanhayaḥ karmāṇyupasthāpapitum /	Specially as the fires, appearing in the course of performances, are quite capable of accomplishing the Sacrifices.
yathaiva procaṇādīnāṃ vrohyādisvarūpamatikramya khādirattvādināṃ ca suvādisvarūpaṃ kammāpūrvaprayutatvaṃ kalpitaṃ tathā ''dhānasyāpi agnisvarūpātikrameṇa kalpayitavyayaṃ yadi cāgnisvarūpamā prayuktamevādhānaṃ bhavettataḥ kamāṇyanāhitenāpyagninā sidhyeyaḥ /	We have found that the washing of the Vrihicorn is not for the sake of the mere form of it, and so also the mention of Khadira is not for the sake of the mere form of it,and that both of these are meant to be the means to the accomplishment of the Apurva Transcendental Result of Sacrifices and exactly in the same manner, the Laying of Fire would be not for the sake of the mere form of Agui, but for the bringing about of the Sacrificial Apurru. If the Laying were merely meant to be the means of bringing about the form of the Fire, then, in that case, the Sacrifice would come to be performed even by those who may not have laid the Sacrificial Fire performed Agnyadhāna. As for the injunction of a distinct time for the Laying, that could be taken as pertaining to the common character of the performance inst like the Cutting of the Sacrificial post laid down by Direct and Indirect.
taiśca puruṣasya saguṇaiḥ kāryaṃ nāgnibhiḥ /	Injunctions and hence that could not justify our taking the Luying to be for the sake of all Sacrifices.
tenāvaśyaṃ bhāvini kamasaṃbandhe prakatyarthatvamahimatātvādupanyastam /	And for these reasons the common character of the Lay. The clause Svakalatvat in the Sutra is to be taken in the sense of Svatantryamnānāt,i.e. because the Laying is laid down independently by itself.
yattu svakālatvaṃ tadupadeśātideśaprāptasya yūpacchedanavatprayogasādhāraṇyārthamiti na sarvārthatvaṃ gamayati /	It has been argued that, from the Analogy of other Injunctions that do not occur in the Context of any particular Sacrifice, we must infer the fact of the Injunction of the Laying also to pertain to all Sacrifices. But to that we offer the following reply In the case of those other In juuctions, we took up the question of the actions to which they pertained, after it had been taken for granted that they were subsidiary to some such Sacrifice.
nahi darśapūrṇamāsārthasyāvānasya vasantakālatvaṃ prāptaṃ pratyarḍamāsaṃ prayogapramakteḥ /	In the case in question however, you have no authority for taking the Laying to be subsidiary to any Sacrifice. That is to say, as for the Khadira, etc., though they are connected with the Sruva, etc., yet they are not recognised as to have been laid down merely for the sake of the form of the Sruva, etc because the use of the word Sruva, which is expressive of the Class, would be quite possible, even without the Kha dira inasmuch as the Sruva could be made of other woods also.
nādhyagnihotretaradarvihomārthasya paurṇamāsyamāvāsyākāla praptiḥ / nava prayogasādhāraṇyaṃ svakālavacanāhate siyatauti nānarthakatvamata evaṃ vyācaṣṭe /	In the case in question, on the other hand, we find that the use of such words as Ahavaniya and the like, depend, for their denotation, upon the due performance of the sanctifica tory rite of the Laying and as such, they are not applied to the Fire, until that rite has been duly performed and hence the Luying comes to be recognised as having its use in the supplying of the basis for the denotation of the said words Ahavaniya, etc., Then, it has been argued that, even without the Luying of fire, there would be no discrepancy in the Sacrifices. But the discrepancy is due, not to the absence of the Laying itself, but to the nonaccomplish ment without the Laying of the Ahavaniya Fire which is a necessary factor in all Sacrifices.
na kasya citkarmaṇo'ṅgamādhānaṃ kiṃ tarhi dvitīyā saṃyogātṛtīyādhyāyasya ṣaṣṭhaḥ pāda /	If all the effect of the neglecting of Laying con sisted merely in the nonfulfilment of the Laying alone, then, there would be no discrepancy in the Sacrifice by such neglect.
dagnyarthameva /	For these reasons, we conclude that the Laying is for the sake of the Fire.
svakālatvādityapi svātantryāmnānādityarthaḥ / yattvitarānārabhyavādavaditi tatrābhidhīyate / siddhe'ṅgatve tatasteṣāṃ kimarthatvaṃ vicāritam /	As for the Sutra Dravyasyäkarmukālanirpatteḥ XIiii, which might be quoted against the present Siddhantu, we shall explain, under that Sutra, that it puts forward a theory only by way of admitting for the sake of argument. The above reasonings also tend to show that the Paramāneșțis also are for the sake of the due preparation of the Fire.
na tu karmaṅgabhāve hi pramāṇaṃ kiṃ cidasti te	As a matter of fact, however the Iştis serve the purpose of accomplishing the said Sacrificial Fires and as such could not stand in need of any help from these latter and that which is not wanted could not be laid down, either directly, or by Implication.
docāsu hi somakrayasamaupe agnīṣomauya samābrāyate /	In connection with the AgnisfomaTerminus Samstha, of the Jyotis toma Sacrifice, there are laid down three AnimalSacrifices, of the Agnisomiya, the Savaniya and the Anubandhya animals.

Then again, how could we connect the whole thing with the preclusion con tained in Sutra, of the fact of the Details belonging to the Savaniya only, which has not been declared by the mention of the absence of Con toxtand this Siddhanta Sutra, being found to be irrelevant, would make Or, it might be possible for us to take what is put forward in the present Sutra as the first Pürvapakşa and as the second Purvapakṣa, we would have the theory that the details belong to the Savaniya only which has not been put forward in any Sūtra and then we would have the Siddhanta put forth in Sutra .
na ca tathā prakaraṇaṃ bhavati /	But this procedure has not been adopted by the Bhasya which has recourse to the much simpler method of putting forward the first of the aforesaid alternatives i.e.

That is to say, in connection with the Initiatory Sacrifices we find the Agnisomiya animal laid down, in proximity to the Purchase of Soma and though, through the force of Syntactical Connection, it would appear that this animal is to be dealt with in proximity to the details relating to the animal,yet it is not found to be so dealt with in view of the Context because all Contexts operate in regard to the place of origination or appearance. As for the Savaniya animal, the time for its appearance is that of the Sutya Pounding of the Soma and as for its declaration in connection with the Previous Day, that is simply for the purpose of pointing ont certain details but, this declara tion does not constitute the Context as it occurs at a distance from the Anubandhya animal, which is dealt with at the end of the Soma Sacri fice. And thus we find that the Details in question belong to the Jyotiştoma itself, and to none of the animals concerned as the indi cation of the Position of the Agnişomiya, being at a distance from its objective, would be rejected by those of the Context of the Jyotistoma, which is not interfered by any Subcontext or Syntactical Connection.
satyapi tadaṅgatve yogyatvābhāvānna docaṇauyādiṣvavataraṇam / satyapi ca yogyatve sāmānyasaṃbandhābhāvāntra tadaṅgapaśūnām /	As for the Dikṣaniya Isti, however, even though that too is a subsidiary of the Jyotiṣṭoma, yet the details do not pertain to it for the simple reason that it is incapable of utilising them. Nor do they pertain to the animals that come in as accessories of the Dikshaṇīyā Isti because even though they are capable of taking in those details, yet there is no sort of general relationship between these animals and the said Details.

na caitasya tadā darśapū māsaprakṛtitvaṃ bhavet /	As a matter of fact, with out the Details in question, the Agnishomiya could never form part of “the DarçaPūrṇamāsa sacrifices as that which forms the origin of the AnimalSacrifices, viz.

We quite readily admit of the fact of the Details belonging to the Agnishomiya, through Position but we cannot accept the assertion of that they belong to the Savaniya, by reason of the Context. Because the remention of the Savaniya animals in connection with the Previous Day serves the purpose of pointing out an accessory while as for the appearance of those animals, which actually occurs after the Holding of the Ãgvīna Cup on the day following the sacrifice, it is pointed out by the Context.
tasmādanupālambhaḥ sūtrasya / śvastvekeṣāṃ tatra prāk śrutirguṇārthā	And thus we find that the previous mention of the Savaniya is for durpose of pointing out this accessory the Vapă, lat of it, as to be used in the offering and it gives us an idea of the Context.
yaduktaṃ sthānādagnīṣomauyārthā ityetad gṛhomaḥ / yattu prakaraṇātmavanauyārthā ityetanna mṛṇyāmahe kutaḥ /	Question What are the words by which the Accessory is laid down? That is to say, the sentence quoted āçvinam graham yṛhitvā, etc.,is found to serve the purpose of pointing out the order of sequence of certain actions and as such it could not serve as the originative Injunc tion of the Savaniya. In reply to this, the Author of the Bhashya shows that it is only the Agnēyu animal, out of the many Savaniya animals, that is spoken of as appearing tomorrow.
guṇārthopavasadhye 'nhi savanauyapunaḥśrutiḥ /	i And some people explain this portion of the Bhashya in the fol.

This is meant to show that there are many such sentences but in any case, it is the men tion of the Agneyu only that serves any useful purpose. Even though the Aindragna and the other Savanīya animals have their original ap pearance on the Previous Day, yet, inasmuch as they are used in the subsequent Terminuses the performance whereof is not absolutely necessary, they have not the power to take in utilise those acces sory details of animals, which are laid down as absolutely necessary.
tena tadeva guṇārthaṃ śravaṇamitarathā hi vākyaṃ bhidyeta /	As for that Savanîya, which, being necessary, is capable of utilising the said details, we have already shown that the Context does not point to that. For these reasons, we conclude that the details do not belong to the Suvaniya.

That is to say, the sentence · Vapayā prātaḥ savanē prucaranti transfers the chief of the details in questionnamely, the pracara of the Fat and inasmuch as the subsidiaries always follow the Principal, the other Detailsof killing, etc..also are transferred but with all this there remains an uncertainty as to the exact time and the time immediately after the Holding of the Açvina Vessel is then laid down by the sentence ‘āçvinan grhītvā, etc.”.

A Objection The Tying of the Rope, being already related to the sacrifice through Implication, the sentence can be taken as laying down the Sacrifice as to be performed at the same time as the Tying, the mention of this latter being merely by way of a descriptive refer ence and in this way, there would be no syntactical split.
na ca pūrveyuḥ kṛtasyāśvinagrahaṇottarakālaṃ varttamānatvenānuvādo bhavati /	· Reply It is quite true that the connection of the Tying of the Rope is pointed out by Implication but as a matter of fact it is not actually done at the time of the Savanīyu for the simple reason that the Sacrificial Post remaining the same at all the Animal sacri fices, all the aid due to the said Tying, becomes accorded to the Savaniya also, by the Tying that has been done previously at the time of the Agnishomiya,in accordance with the law Talkālāstu. etc.

na ca pūrvakṛtasya paryagni kṛ tādiśabdavadohaśena śabdenānuvādaḥ pūrvottara kālakamavadhidayaparicchinnatvāt /	Reply No such descriptive reference is possible for the simple reason that the Tying is not recognised to be the same that is spoken of by way of descriptive reference which is recognised to be certainly that which will have been done on the Previous day, could not be referred to as existing on the day after the Holding of the Açvina Vessel nor is there any Tying of the Rope done on this latter day and as for the Tying that may have been done on the previous day, that could not be spoken of by way of reference by such words, as by the word paryaginikṛta and the like because the Tying is limited by limits of the two actions performed at the two points of time.
evaṃ tahya smāḍācyātprāptamanūyatāṃ sa āśvinaṃ grahaṃ gṛhītvopaniṣkramya yūpaṃ parivyayatīti /	Objection In that case we can take the sentence āçvinam.

tadapi nāsti pratyabhijñānābhāvādeva /	Reply But this also is not the case for the same reason of nonrecognition.

tasmādasya guṇārthatvādasti pūrveyuḥ savanīyānāṃ prakaraṇamiti /	And hence, inasmuch as these sentences are found to serve the purpose of laying down accessories, it must be admitted that there is a Context of the Savaniya Animals.

utpattivākye na doṣaḥ tasmādetanṛtpattyarthamiti/	On the other hand, if this sentence be taken as an Originative Injunction, there would be no such anomaly hence we conclude that the sentence is an Origina tive Injunction.

śañcastviha pūrvedyaḥ prāptopākaraṇotkarṣamāvavighānāḍākyabhedaḥ pariharttum /	But the syntactical split is capable of being avoided by taking the sentence to be an Injunction only of the transference of the Killing which had been taken as to be performed on the previous day.

yataḥ sāmānyenotkarṣaprāptiṃ dṛṣṭvā viśeṣaparasyārthāpattikopa kalpyeta /	In the case in question on the other hand, we have no such contrary element, in the shape of an Injunction of transference in general, which could weaken the Apparent Inconsistency pointing to the Injunction of the particular Transferences.

Consequently, though the sentence Açrinam graham, etc..` enjoins the Prātaḥsavana the morn ing offering, as well as the fact of its being performed after the Holding of the Açvina Vessels, yet, inasmuch as the Injunctive Agency is confined to a single word.
ata eva bhāṣyakāreṇāne ka vidhidūṣaṇe 'bhihitaṃ na cāneko 'rthaḥ parasparāsaṃbandhe sati śakyo vidhātumiti /	there is no case of these being, wholly distinct Injunctions for each of the factors concerned, as shown under Sutra IIii in fact it is only of one factor i.c. of the time that we have an actual Injunction, which, however, implies that of the other i.e.

na cehāsti sa pakṣo yadveṣa vidhiḥ sutyāprātaḥ savanasaṃbandhāvakṛtvā āśvina gṛhaṇānanta vidadhyāttammādadoṣaḥ /	The only way to make such an implication untenable is to show that the Injunction sought to be implied is otherwise obtainable and as such there is no Apparent Inconsistency to justify such implication. But as a matter of fact, in the case in question, we find that there is no such alternative as would admit of the Injunction pertaining only to the sequence of the Savaniya to the Holding of the Ãçvina Vessel, without pointing out any sort of relationship between that Savaniya and the Sutya and the Morn ingoffering.
nacaiva tveṣa doṣaḥ yasyānekadravyadevatāviśiṣṭakarma vidhānam /	And hence there can be nothing objectionable in the aforesaid Implication. In fact, the objection is applicable to you who have sought to justify the Bhashya in the aforesaid manner, who take the Injune tion to be one of an Action qualified by many Substances and Deities.
api ca jyotiṣṭomasutyāprātaḥ savanaviśeṣa kālasaṃyogo 'paraḥ kalpanauya /	Then again, it would be necessary for you to make a still further assumption, of the relationship, of the Action, with the Jyotishtoma, the Sutya, the Morningoffering and the particular time after the Holding of the Açvina Vessel.

yattvanuniṣpādi bahupi puruṣasya śā svasya ca vyāpārantaramantareṇaiva sidhyati na tena kaśvidāyāso bhavati /	While as regards that which follows in the wake of another object, it is found to be accomplished, even though there be very many of it, without any distinct effort on the part, either of the human agent, or on that of the Scripture.
na cehāśvinagrahaṇānantarye vidhīyamāne 'nuṣṭhīyamāne vā sutyāprātaḥsavanādisaṃbandhe bhedena vyāparitavyam /	In the case in question, we find that the sequence of the Savaniya to the Holding of the Açvina Vessel being enjoined, it would not necessitate any distinct effort to establish the connection of that Savaniya with the Sutya, the Morningoffering,etc. and hence there is nothing that enjoins Transference in general.

For if there were to be a syntactical split in such cases, there would be one in the case of the sentence bring the Çimçapā because in this also, we have the word Çimçapo implying the generic factors of tree, Earth, Substance.

tadapi tu suparihara kevalaparivyāṇotkarṣādeva tadādi vā 'bhisaṃbandhādityevasupākaraṇotkarṣasiddheḥ /	In view of the above, others seek to explain the Syntactical split spoken of in the Bhashya, as that which is caused by the fact of both the Tying of the Rope and the Killing being transferred by means of the same sentence. But this also is very easily refuted as it is only the Tying of the Rope that is transferred by the sentence the transference of the Killing being implied by the same transference, in accordance with the Sutra Vi.

athocyetāviśeṣita sādhanakatvāttatva trivṛttvānuvādo na saṃbhavatīti tadyuktam /	It might be argued that, inasmuch as the sentence Sa vai, etc., mentions the Rope without any qualifications, the mention, in the sentence under consideration, of threefoldness could not be taken as a mere descriptive reference to a previouslyenjoined object.
tenāpūrvakarmavidhiṣvapyetaddivektavyama/	But this is not quite tenable because the reply to this argu ment would be exactly the same which the Siddhantin would give later on to a question put to him by the Pūrvapakshin.

tadiha vapāpracāra upādeya mutyākāla sthasavanauyānuvādena śakyo vidhātuṃ kiṃ punaḥ prātaḥsavanaśrutyā taddeśasavanauyapratyabhijñāne sati śvastane punarāmrāne nirjñātaprayojana tvādāśivanagrahagona sahāṅgāsiṃbandhābhāvātkālāyeṃ saṃyoge tasyānupādeyatvātkamaheśena vidhyanupapatteravaśyaṃ kāloheśena karma vidheyam / athāpyāśvinaṃ pratyaṅgatvena vidhistathā 'pyaṅgino 'nupādeyatvādeṣaiva vacanavyaktirataśca guṇa vidhyanupapateravaśyaṃ prakaraṇāntaranyāyenotpattividheranyenāntareṇāpratibandhādutpattābavadhāyamāṇāyāṃ karmāntara myāt /	Hence even in the case of the Injunctions of new actions not previously enjoined, it is necessary to differentiate its own qualifying Accessory from those of others. Thus then, inasmuch as the objection brought forward is equally applicable to both of us the Purvapakshin as well as the Siddhantin, it should not have been urged against one only. And this would indicate that the Threefold Rope spoken of in the sentence under “consideration Trvrtā yûpam pariviya, would apply to any and every Tying of the Sacrificial Post so that, in the case in ques tion, the mention of the Tying in the sentence under considera tion is only by way of reference to that previously enjoined in the sentence sa vai āçvinam,etc. and hence there would be no Syntac tical split. Or, the sentence may be taken as laying down the immediate sequence to the Holding of the Açvina Vessel, in reference to the sequence of the Killing to the Tying, which latter has already been enjoined in connection with the Previous Day,the sentence, in this case, being construed asyat trvṛtā yupam pariviya upakaroti tal • Āçvinagrahavānantaram kāryam the Tying of the threefold Rope round the Post, as laid down in regard to the Previous Day should, on the second Day, be done after the Holding of the Açvina Vessel In this way we avoid the Syntactical split complained of, and cer tainly any farfetched construction is more acceptable than a Syntac tical split.
'tenāsya tāvatkālāpekṣayotpādakatvaṃ siddham / ataścetarasya pariśeṣasiddhaṃ guṇavidhitvaṃ na hi tasya kiṃ ciddhedakāraṇam /	Reply Though it is so, yet, inasmuch it is not possible for the two sentences to be taken either as optional alternatives or con jointly, it becomes necessary to find out which of the two could, through a certain peculiarity in it, be accepted, by preference, as the required Originative Injunction. And hence we proceed to find out such a peculiarity. It has already been shown above that it is only a desirable Accessory that can be laid down with reference to an Action laid down in the recesses of a remote Injunction.
ata eva vapāpracāraṇotkarṣo 'sti nāstīti vicāritam / sati hi vapāpracāragotkarṣe pūrvasyaiva prātaḥsavane viparihatteḥ kālaṃ pratyupādānaṃ pratyabhijñānātkalpyeta /	Thus then, inasmuch as the sentence cannot be taken as an In junction of accessories and hence the peculiarity, whereby, the origi native Injunction not being interfered with, the coguition of the original appearance of the Action would make it a distinct Action, in accordance with the Law of the Difference of Actions being due to the difference in the Contexts,that same poculiarity would make the sentence an originative Injunction with regard to the time therein pointed out. And thus the other sentence, naturally, comes to be taken as the Injunction of Accessories as under the above circum stances, there would be no justification for a syntactical split. It was for this reason that we considered the question as to whether the Vapapracara does, or does not, lead to the transference of the Savaniya.
yathota sannidhau tvavibhāgāditi /	And as to how the two sentences are reconciled and taken along with each other, in accordance with our view,that we have explained already.
kāle ca karmaṇi vidhīyamāne pratyayasya sannikṛṣṭe 'rthe vyāpāro bhaviṣyati vapāpracārakālasya punaḥ savanauyotpattikriyātaḥ kriyāntara viśeṣaṇatvādduṣpratipādo viśiṣṭavidhiriti vākyabhedaḥ syāt /	Thus then, the sentence could also speak of the subsidiary charac ter of the Tyingas shown by the Contextby way of descriptive reference otherwise it would have to refer to it, as enjoined by the remoter agency of Position. For these reasons, it must be admitted that the originative In junction of the Savaniya is contained in the sentence Açvinam graham,etc. Question How could you reconcile the above explanation with the mention of Syntactical split made in the Bhāshya ?” Answer What the Bhashya means by the expression · Vākybhēda is the difference of actions and not Syntactical split as even if there be many factors, if they happen to be related to one another, the whole is quite capable of being taken as a single sentence syntactically connected.

Or, the great Context of the Jyotishloma, being found to be not interfered with by any subcontext of the Savaniya, would point to the Details as belonging to all three animals and as such would set aside the indications of the Position of the Agnishomiya and it is with a view to preclude this view, that we have the word tu in the Sutra. Though it is quite true that Context is superior in authority to Posi tion, yet, in accordance with the Law of the Upāmçuyājanumantraṇa ii et seq., it is the Position aided by Indicative Force which, in the present case, becomes more authoritative than the said Context.

karmaṇo bheda evāyaṃ vākyabhedo 'bhidhīyate / saṃbandhe tvekavākyatvamarthānyatve 'pi gamyate	It is in reply to this that we have the present Sutra the sense of which is as follows As a matter of fact the Cake is not laid down for the purpose of covering the hole as we have already shown, under the Arthavāda Pāda, that all such sentences, as have the appearances of Injunctions, and also those that appear as argumenta tive in form, are mere Arthavadas.
somanāśe hi pratinidhyapekṣāyāṃ satyāṃ putīkā vi dhoyante na yāgasādhanāpekṣāyām /	Nor, as a matter, do we find the Sacrifice standing in need of a covering of the hole nor do we find any hole covered, even after the Cakesacrifice has been performed.
ato 'yaṃ pratinidhiniyama eva bhavati yatsakalasomadharmāsaṃbhave vikalānsaṃ madharmānutpādayettatpūtokagatāniti /	Hence it must be admitted that the Covering of the hole is not the purpose served by the Cakeoffering and as such the Indications, shown under the previous Sutra, remain fully established. Sutra It is no Injunction as it serves the purposes of an Arthavada. Sūtra “Inasmuch as the two Milkings are done at different times, the mere Milk would be pre pared without connection with the Accessories.” Having shown the noncontradiction of Position, we now proceed to deal with its contradiction by Direct Declaration, etc..
vacyati hi niyamārtha kvaciddidhiḥ /	And though it is true that, for the purpose of making the Curd, some of the details are done on the Previous Day, yet those details.
tannityaṃ taccikorṣā hoti ca /	And the reason for this is that there is one and the same Context.
ataśca naivātra pūtīkalaṃ kama kiṃ tarhi somadharmopalakṣaṇārtha tena śrutilacaṇasthāpi pūrveṇāviśiṣṭatvamiti /	There can be no SubContext of the Morningoffering by itself as there is no result laid down as following from this offering. Then as for Position, it cannot, when contradicted by Context, serve the purpose of indicating the use of things. Hence it must be admitted that the Details should be done in connection with the Vessels of the other Savanas also. Sūtra The Rope also as well as its accessories is applicable to all because of words indicative of this.
tenehāpi tadeva cintāyāḥ prayojanam /	And then, it becomes necessary to have some material for these two Tyings.
ata tadāśrayasya tahuḍayanapāyādguṇakāmai pravarttitavyam /	And hence we come to the conclusion that it is the Rope that should be used in both cases, as being the only thing could serve the purpose. And then, there arises the question, as to, the material that the Rope is to be made of, and also its distinguishing features.
anye vāhuḥ sakalavyaktyāśrayaṇo hi guṇakāmā vaikalyādiha na pravarttante /	Question Is this reasonthe fulfilling of its functionssome thing apart from, or included in, Direct Injunction and Implication ? Some people hold it to be something wholly distinct but, if it were so, then it could not be recognised as authoritative consequently, we must regard it as included in Implication.

As a matter of fact however, we have no authority for taking the Nivara as a direct auxiliary to the Action as the substance that is laid down as such an auxiliary is the Vrihi and people take up the Nivāru, only when no Vrihi or its enjoined alternative, Yuva is available and that too, because of the presence, in the Nivära, of certain properties that belong to the Vrihi, and which properties are what the performer is auxious to get hold of in the absence of the exact Vrihi and it is only as the inevitable concomitant a substrate of those properties, that he is led to take up the species of corn, called Nivara, which latter is not taken up as a Direct Auxiliary, to the Sacrifice. The said accessory properties of the Vrihi are enjoined directly and hence the Nivara must be regarded as equally related to these specially as we shall show later on that we do not cease to have the idea of Vrihi with regard to the Nīvāra, under the Sutra sāmānyantaccikīrshā hi VIiii.

Thus then, inasmuch as it would be necessary to finish the Sacrifice that has been begun, it would be completed all the same, whether the remaining portion of it be done with a substitute or a modification of the Original substance. And the present Adhi karaṇa also serves the purpose of showing whether there is to be an Üha modification in the Mantra or not in cases where we employ the substitute.
aneka graha camasayāgābhyāsātmakaścatuḥsaṃstho jyotiṣṭomo 'vadhāritaḥ sarvasaṃsthāsu tu jyotiṣṭomarūpamanusyūtam /	Sūtra The Samsthus Terminuses of the Jyotish toma are all equally related to the enjoined accessories as all of them occur in the same Context, The Jyotishtoma has been held to consist of four Terminuses, made up of several repititions of the many offerings of Vessels and Cups and over all these Terminuses pervades the character of the Jyotish toma.

And with regard to these details, there arises the question as to whether these have been laid down with reference to the Jyotishloma as constituted by all the Terminuses, or only to that consisting of the Agnishtoma Terminus only.
na tvayamupanyāso yuktaḥ na hi dharmasaṃbandhavelāyāmuddiśyamānasya jyotiṣṭomasya kā citsaṃsthā vi śeṣaṇatvena śrūyate /	This propounding of the question is not quite proper. Because at the time that the Details are laid down with reference to the Jyotishtoma, it is not spoken of as qualified by any of the Termi.
yadyapi kathaṃ cicchūyaṃta tathā 'pyuddiśyamāna viśeṣaṇatvānna vivayeta na cokthyādigrahaṇāṃśena jyotiṣṭomasya grāhakatvaṃ phalasādhanabhāvāddhi tavokthyādaya evetikarttavyatāvanto bhavanti jyotiṣṭomastabāśrayatvenopasarjanabhāvāntra dharmagrahaṇayogyo vijñāyate /	Even if some such qualifications were mentioned, no signifi cance could be attached to them, as they would be qualifications of the subject of a proposition i. e. that with reference to which something is laid down. Nor could the fact of the Terminuses, the Ukthya and the rest, taking up an accessory justify our speaking of the Jyotishtoma itself taking up that accessory. Because these Termi nuses also lead to distinct results of their own, and as such every one of them would have its own procedure wholly to itself and as for the Jyotishtoma, it could only serve as the substrate of all these, and as such would occupy only a secondary position and as such it could not be recognised as capable of taking up any accessories.
jyotiṣṭomasya dharmasaṃbandhaḥ sarvasaṃsthāsvaviśiṣṭa ityagniṣṭomasaṃsthamevetyayuktam ata evaṃ vaktavyam /	Then again, inasmuch as the sentencesone should perform the Jyotish toma, for the acquiring of Heaven points to the fact of all the details of the Jyotishtoma being equally related to all the Terminuses, any specification of the Agnishtoma only would be absolutely meaning less.
kiṃ jyotiṣṭomasyaivaitaḍammammānamutokthyādīnāmapi saṃsthānāmiti/	In view of these arguments, we must put forward the question in the following words Are the Details laid down meant for the Jyotish toma only, or for the Ukthya and other Terminuses also? The Bhashya also may be thus explained as really patting forward the question in this same form.
ya dyapi saṃsthābhiīrmā gṛhyante tathā 'pi tāsāṃ svayamakriyātmakatvāt jyotiṣṭoma evāśrayatvād hārambhavatīti kiṃ sarvasaṃsthaṃ prakṛtyetyāha /	Though the Details are taken up by the Terminuses, yet inasmuch as these themselves have not the character of action, it is the Jyotish toma which, serving as their substrate, becomes the means by which. they take up the details and it is with a view to this fact that the Bhashya says Kim sarvasamstham Jyotishtomam prakrtya the sense of the question being whether the Details are laid down with reference to that which serves as the means and leads to a desirable result i.e. the Jyotishtoma, or to that which simply leads to a desirable result i.e.

In the case of the Ukthya and the other Terminuses, though they have the capability of taking up the Jyotishloma, yet this capability is not clearly indicated, as to whether the Details taken up by the Ukthya, etc., belong to, the Jyo tishtoma, through the fact of this latter serving as the means of the former, or only through its own capability of bringing about the desired result. As for the Agnishtoma Terminus, however, it is the one par ticular subsidiary that specially belongs to the Jyotishtoma and hence the fact of the Agnishtoma taking up the Details can be spoken of as the Jyotishtoma itself taking them.

kiṃ prāptaṃ jyotiṣṭomena saha samānaṃ saṃsthānāṃ dharmavidhānam /	The Details are laid down as belonging, in common, to the Jyotishtoma and to the Terminuses because all of them belong to the same Context.

And inasmuch as this proximity is found to apply equally to the case of the Terminuses also, they must be regarded as equally related to the Details in question. And as it is only when there is no trace of Direct Injunction that we have recourse to Implication, we must regard these Details as applying to all the Terminuses by Direct Injunction.

All these specifications with regard to the said Disposal distinctly shows that all Injunctions of accessories pertain equally to the Jyotishtoma and its Terminuses.

If, through Syntactical Connection, something laid down in the Context of the Jyotishloma, be taken as related to the Terminuses,then, can there be a connection with a relation ship that is wholly unconnected? We have seen, on a former occasion that the mere fact of the Drāduçaha being related to the Ahina did not lead us to take the details in connection with the Remnants, as belonging being subservient to the Ahīna specially as the force of all declarations is spent up over what is directly expressed by the words.

As a matter of fact however, we find this also mentioned just in the same way as the other Terminuses and this leads us to the conclusion that the accessories such as the Disposals spoken of.
taccaivaṃ na labhyate yadi saṃsthānāmapi sādhāraṇaṃ prakaraṇam /	are not laid down with specific reference to the Agnishtoma only And this specific mention would not be possible, if the Context belonged equally to all the Terminuses.

Because what is called Agnishtoma is that sacrifice which ends with the AgnishtomaHymn, and not that which merely contains that Hymn and similarly that which ends with the Ukthya Hymn I could never be finished at the previous Terminus and hence, in that case, we could not justify the use of the words second and third, in accordance with any theory either the Purvapaksha or the Siddhānta. Reply True, it would have been equally inexplicable for both of us if the Goats had been specialised by the Terminuses only.

tathā ca bhāṣyakāra āha dve hi tatra nimitta agniṣṭomastovamukthyastotraṃ ceti siḍavadetadvavauti /	It is this what the Bhashya declares as a wellestab lished fact, in the sentence Dvē hi talra nimitte, Agnishlomastotram Ukthyastotran ca.

As a matter of fact, we find that it is the Terminuses that, as serving the useful purpose of bringing about distinct results, are more readily capable of being taken as the prompting causes of the goats. To this question, some people make the following reply Even though the words are common to the Hymn as well as to the Terminus, yet, it is with a view to a more extensive scope of the scriptural text, that we take them as specified by the Hymns. Or, the words are applicable to the Terminuses as qualified by the particular Hymns and hence so long as we can take the animals as prompted by the previouslycognized qualifications Hymns,, we cannot rightly take it to be due to the subsequently.

yahā '' kṛtyadhikaragānyāyenaitra stotreṣu mukhyaḥ śabdaḥ saṃsthāyāṃ lākṣaṇikaḥ / śrutyasaṃbhave ca lakṣaṇā āthayitavyā /	Or, in accordance with the Akriyadhikarana Iiii et. seq., the words denote the Hymns directly, while the Terminuses, they only indicate indirectly and it is only when the acceptance of the directly denoted is incompatible, that we can have recourse to what is indirect ly indicated. And the Hymn also can be taken, through the presence of the Locative affix in the sentence agnishtome alabhëta, as the prompting cause.
niṣphalānāmapi ca bhedanādaunāṃ vacana sāmarthyānnimittatvamiṣṭam / atha vā saṃdigdheṣu vākyaśeṣādityevaṃ stotrāśrayaṇam /	Even though the Hymns may not bring about distinct results, yet, on the sole strength of Direct Declaration, we could, quite reasonably, accept them as prompting causes, just as in the case of the breaking in the sentence bhinnē juhoti. Or, lastly, we accept the Hymns as the prompting cause, in accordance with the Sutra sandigdhëshu vākyuçëshāt Iiv Even though the Terminuses from the Principal Denotation of the words Agnishtoma, etc., yet we accept the Hymns as the prompting cause, through indirect interpretation, based upon the Vakyaçesha “i.e. subsequent sentences bearing upon the subject.

āgneyamajamagniṣṭomaālabheta śrāgneyo hyagniṣṭāma iti / katarasminnagniṣṭomeya āgneyaḥ stotrasya ca stutibhāgagnidevatā vidyate na saṃsthāyāḥ /	in continuation of the sentence, ‘āgnēyamajamagnishtoma alabhēta we find the words Āgnēyo hyaginshtamah and the meaning of this is that the Āgnēya goat is to be employed at that Agnishtoma which is Agneya that which belongs to the Deity of Agni and then we find that it is the Hymn, and not the Terminus, which belongs to the Deity o Agni, which is the Deity to whom the Hymn is addressed.
sā hi vyāpāraparityāgā tmakatvodabhāvabhūtā na cābhāvasya devatayā kāryyamasti /	As for the Terminus, it consists of the cessation of operations and as such it is a negative entity consequently it could not be required by the Deity.
yāgābhyāse 'pi hi yā devatā sā tasyaivāgneyatvaṃ karoti na saṃsthāyāḥ /	Then again, as for the Deities appearing in connection with the various repititions of the Sacrifices, those also pertain to the Hymn, and not to the Terminus.
na ca sa eva saṃsthā / taduttarakālaudāsaunyavacanatvātsaṃpūrvasya tiṣṭhateḥ /	Nor could the Repitition itself be taken as the Terminus because what is signified by the root · san + sthā is the state of indifference that follows after the completion of an Action.
na cānyagatayā devatayā 'nyasya vyapadaśo bhavati /	Nor could one thing the Terminus be spoken of as connected with the Deity of another the Hymn.

api caindrāgnāni ukthyānīti sphuṭameva stotragrahaṇam / na hi saṃsthokthyānī tyanena śabdenocyate /	In fact by certain sentences, such as Aindrīgnāni Ukthyāni it is clear that these refer to Ilymns, and not to the Terminuses, because these latter are never spoken of as Ukthyāni .
tasmātsati stotranimittatve yuktaḥ samuccaya iti /	Thus then the specification of the Goats being due to the Hymns, it is only right that they should be employed together.

That is to say, if the mere fact of one Declaration being directly mentioned in the Veda were the sole reason for the setting aside of all other declarations bearing upon the question, there would be nothing that would not be set aside, no matter whether it pertain to the same Sacrifice or to others, whether it bring about visible or invisible results, and whether it occur in the same process or not.
virodhe sati bādho hi virodhaścaikagocaraḥ	And as such there is a distinct contradiction, which tends to one being set aside by the other.

GS To this some people make the following reply It is only the last of all which, having no scope at all and thus being the most particular of all, would set aside all the rest and the middle one could not have any such rejective potency.

For instance, the Agnēya goat, being employed at the four Terminuses, common or general and so is the Aindragna also, which belongs to three Terminuses. And the effort necessary for getting is at the former is just the same as that for getting at the latter. As for the Ewe the last of the animals mentioned, however, it does not matter even if it be due wholly to the Terininus itself because there is no other Terminus of the Jyotishtoma beyond that at which the Ewe is employed and as such, there could be no rejection of this last one.

na tu samānavidhipakṣe prakṛtiliṅgasaṃyogaḥ kaścidona kāryyāpattiravadhārthyeta /	though there be no rejection, yet it could be taken only as an option al alternative because we do not find any case where two things, serving exactly the same purpose, are both employed at one and the same time according to the law Tulyarthānām vikalpaḥ.

Hence, it becomes absolutely necessary for us to indicate some such point of difference as would show the Purvapaksha, and not the Siddhanta theory to be supported by the said Declaration. And this point of difference is as follows In accordance with the Pūrvapaksha, all the Animals would be equally present in all the subsidiaries and the mère name Savanīya could not preclude them, as they would have been brought in by reason of that fact.
tenaivaṃ samarthanīyaṃ kamantaramevadaṃ vidhīyamānaṃ kimapūrvāntarasāvanatvaṃ pratipadyatāmuta prākṛtasavanīyāpūrvameva sādhayatviti pūrvaklaptāpūrvaviniyogamātre saṃbhavati nāpūrvāntara kalpayitvā tatsādhanatvādhyavasānaṃ yuktam /	That is to say, all the Animals would be liable to be employed at all the Terminuses and hence, the absence, in the previous Terminuses, of the Animals mentioned subsequently, would be due to the simple fact of there being no cause for their presence at these but the previously mentioned Animals would certainly be employed at the subsequently mentioned Terminuses as there would be a direct cause for this specially as this is distinctly indicated by Syntactical Con nection.

As a matter of fact, every modification as the Siddhanti regards the Terminuses to be stands in need of some words indicative of its Original Primary and hence the animals could be taken as serving the functions of one another. In the case of the Purvapaksha however, every one of them being equally related to the Injunction, there can be no presence of words indicative of any Original Primary and hence, in this case, there is nothing that could lead us to take the Animals as serving the functions of one another.

Similarly, in the case of the Apūrva of the Savaniya, the liability of whose performance is shown by Implication, at the time that it would be seeking for the means to its accomplishment, it could not abandon the directlyenjoined Sava niya, and take to an altogether different Savaniya as in all cases, a new factor is admissible, only when the original is found to be absolutely inadmissible.

Answer Exactly in the same manner as in the case of the Purvapaksha, the other Apurva leads to the operation of the Sacrifice. Question What then would be the difference between the two theories? S Answer When the Sacrificial Operation stands in need of Apūrvas, then, in that case, the Apūrva of the Modificatory Savaniya is not duly recognised and hence the said operation could fall in with this Apurva. When, however, it is the Apūrva that stands in need of the Action Sacrificial Operation, then, inasmuch as we obtain the idea of a distinct Action, connected with the word Sava niya, which is indicative of the Original Primary,it rejects the Original Action.

Reply This objection does not affect the case because if what the Bhashya meant to declare were the nonperception of mutual rejection, in the case of the Aindrāgna and other Animals, laid down with regard to other Actions,then such a declaration would be wholly groundless as there is no rejection of the subsequently mentioned ani mals.

vikārāstu kāmasaṃyoge nityasya samatvāt	Sutra The Terminuses are mere modifications of the Jyotishtoma because, being spoken of in. connection with distinct desirable results, they are equal to the Nitya.

Objection It as it is only when the Ukthya, etc., have become endowed with the character of Terminuses, that they stand in need of something with an end.
na caiṣāṃ prāk jayotiṣṭomasaṃbandhātsamāptitvatantravārtike /	As a matter of fact, we find that, they have C no such character of Terminus, before they have been connected with the Jyotishloma as the word Terminus stands in need of a beginning and a middle.
atha prathamaṃ tatsaṃbandhastataḥ prathamaṃ kratvaryatve 'vadhārite phalasaṃbanvābhāvātsa nityasya samatvādityevamavikāratvaprasagaḥ /	Then, if that Connection with the Jyotish toma be the first to be established, then, in that case, they would, from the very beginning, come to be recognised as being subordinate to the Sacrifice and as such they would have no connection with any result desired by man and as this would constitute an equality with the Nitya sa nityasya samatvāt they would cease to be known as modifications.

ukthyastovasaṃbandhādi samāptirevokthyaśabdenocyate tatsaṃbandhādgahaupacaryate /	in that case, would be as to the Injunction of Details being for the sake of the Jyotishtoma or for that of the Holding,etc. And as for the word Terminus Samsthā, inasmuch as these Holdings, etc, are laid down at the end, they have a distinct relationship with an end and as such, the name Samsthā Terminus can very well apply to them.
ukdhyena yajetokthyo yatta iti /	laid down as appearing at the end of the previous Action the Holding and as such these Actions come to be spoken of as other Terminuses.

And as a matter of fact, we find that the words Ukthya, etc., are always used as coextensive with the word Yajña Sacrifice,e.g. Ukthyena yayëta Ukthyo yajñaḥ Shoḍaçinã yajate · shoḍaçî yajñaḥ and as there is no such sacrifice as the Shodaçi, the use of this name in the last sentence is based upon the fact of its denoting the End or Terminus, which is not altogether distinct from the sacrifice itself, and not upon that of its denoting either the Holding or the Hymn.
napuṃsakaliṅgasya stovavacanatvāt /" yastu puṃlliṅgaprayogaḥ stotre va ciddaśyate, yathaikaviṃśaḥ ṣoḍaśauti, sa gauṇa iti pratipattavyam /	Then again, the Masculine gender of Shodaçi could be explicable, only if it denoted the Terminus samāpti as it is only a word in the Neuter gender that could denote the Hymn Stotra. As for the Masculine gender that we sometimes find used in connection with the Hymn, e.g., Ekavimçaḥ shaḍaçi that should be regarded as a figurative use.
iha vākyaśeṣe puṃlliṅgaḥ ṣoḍaśau pratoyate iti saṃsthāvacanaḥ /	Consequently, inasmuch as, in the case in question, we find the word shodaçi in the Masculine gender, in the subsequent portion of the sentence, we conclude that it denotes the Terminus.
atirājeśa prajākāmama iti vispaṣṭameva saṃsthāvacanatvaṃ na hi tava kriyāntaramupāttaṃ yajirapi ca ṇyarthopasarjanatvena śruta kleśena pradhānīkarttavyaḥ /	Then again, we have the sentence Atirātrēņa prajākāmam,where the word Atiratra is found to be distinctly denotative of the Terminus. Because there is no other action mentioned in this as for the root yaji to sacrifice, that too is used only as subservient to the signification of the Causative affix and it would involve a deal of trouble to take it as the predominant factor.
tasmādrāvimatautya yā samāptiḥ sā phalena saṃbadhyate /	Consequently the sentence cannot but be taken as pointing out the connection of the particular Result obtaining of offspring with that Terminus which is reached after the night is over.
yadi ca grahāstovayoḥ phalasaṃbandhaḥ syāttatastayoḥ kriyātvādāśrayāpekṣā nāstīti svatantrayoreva prayogaḥ prāpnoti tava ca prakaraṇāmnāna prayojanamukthyādiśabdaprayogaśca na jñāyeta /	If the Result were connected with the Holding and the Hymn, then, inasmuch as they are independent actions in themselves, they would not stand in need of any other action and henco they would have to be performed independently by themselves. And in that case we could not find any use for their mention in the particular Context nor could we find any explanation for the use of the words kthya,etc. For this reason also it is the Terminuses that lead to the particular results.

And through the superior authority of Direct Declara tion which connects the Terminus with distinct desirable results, we reject the fact of these being subservient to the Sacrifice, which is indicated by the Context.
yastvāśrayāśrayi saṃbandhaḥ so'nuguṇatvādāśrīyate /	As for the relationship of the Container and the Contained subsisting beween the Terminuses and the Jyotish toma Sacrifice, that is accepted, on account of its being quite compat able with the aforesaid Direct Declaration.

And then, on seeking after this particular action, we come to recognise, through another Direct Declaration, a particular Terminus of the Jyotishtoma as that Action IV.

vacanasyātibhārābhāvādabhāvo 'pi codyamānaḥ phalamādhatvena naiva virudhyataiti /	There is yet another explanation offered by some it is this Inasmuch as there is nothing too much for Direct Declaration, there could be no incongruity in the fact of a negative entity the cessation of action being laid down as the means of leading to a definite result.
yathā 'kurvanvihitaṃ karmetyavākaraṇasyāsataḥ pratyavāyahetutvam / atha vā 'styevācaudāsaunyapratipattirūpaḥ saṃkalpa ityavirodhaḥ /	In fact, we do often find such declarations as that the notdoing of the enjoined, as well as the doing of the prohibited,etc. distinctly speaks of a negation, the notdoing, as causing sinfulness. Or, we can regard the cessation from action as involving a positive mental action, in the shape of a determination to remain inactive and thus there can be no such incongruity as urged above.
iha ca yathā guṇātphalaṃ bhavati yathā ca kāmyo guṇo nityamarthaṃ vikaroti tadindriyakāmādhikaraṇagodohanādhikaraṇābhyāmupasaṃharttavyam /	Then, as to how a definite result follows from an accessory detail, and how the Nitya action is modified by the Accessory calculated to bring about a definite result, we should refer to the ‘Indriya kāmā dhikarana IIii,etc. and the Godohanādhikaraṇa vi.
guṇādevaṃjātīya ke phalāniṣpattiḥ / evaṃ hi śrūyate /	This is what is meant by the Bhashyadeclaration In such cases w find results following from the Accessories.

And this distinctly shows that the Ukthya as bring ing about a definite desirable result cannot be regarded as subservient to the Sacrifice. Because, if it were subservient to a Sacrifice, then, even without the word Kama desiring, the Ukthya would be recognised as something that should be done, for the simple reason of its helping in the accomplishment of the Sacrifice. If what is meant to be done is the mere getting hold of the Ukthya, then it would be implied by the very nature of things that the Injunction is meant for one who desires the holding of the Ukthya that is to say, for one who would be seeking for the due bringing about of the mere holding of the Ukthya.

Question In what way is the process of the Jyotishtoma taken up by the Terminuses? If it is by Proximity, then all of them will have to be regarded as equally connected with the enjoined details and this would not be acceptable for the Siddhanti. Nor is mere Proximity enough reason for the Implication of the presence of the accessories of the original sacrifice at its Modifications as such Implication will be shown later on to be due to Similarity. If it be by reason of their serving the functions of the Joytishtoma,then, all that we can say is that the causal efficiency of this fact has been already set aside, Nor are the Dikshaṇīyā, etc., details belonging to the Terminuses and hence they could not be transferred from one Terminus to the other serving the functions of the former.
na ca dokṣaṇīyādayaḥ saṃsthādharmmāḥ yataḥ kāyāpanne saṃsthāntare bhaveyuḥ na jotiṣṭomasyokthyādayaḥ kārye varttate yatastammanpratipadyante /	Nor do the Ukthya and the other Terminuses serve the functions of the Jyotishtoma and as such they could not obtain the accessory details of this latter sacrifice.
etenātideśapacaḥ pratyuktaḥ /	The same reasoning serves to set aside the view that the Process comes in by Implication that is to say.

Though the Agnishtomu has a certain similarity with the other Terminuses, yet there is no sort of similarity of the Jyotishloma to the Ukthya and the other Terminuses and hence the Jyotishtoma cannot be regarded as the Original archetype of these Terminusesand hence the Pro cedure of that Sacrifice could not come into these latter, through the Implicatory Injunction that the Modification should be done in the same way as the Original.
ata eva ca bhāṣyakārī api sannidhānādityetāvanmālamutkā tṛṣṇabhūtastena vattāvyametaducyate /	It is for these reasons that the Author of the Bhashya has kept silent with the mere declaration that it was due to Proximity. And hence it becomes all the more incumbent upon you to explain the difficulties raised above.
atideśo 'yamityetatpurastādeva sādhitam /	Answer That this is a case of Implication we have already shown above.
na ca sārupyamevaikamatideśasya kāraṇam	Nor is Similarity the only ground for Implication. That is to say, we have already shown, in connection with the sentence Dadhnëndri yakāmasya juhuyat, under Sutras IIii et.
yadi yuktyā vinaiveyaṃ nityasyetyabhidhīyate /	Hence in the case in question, even without similarity, the Jyotishtoma comes to be regarded as the substratum of the Terminuses, on the sole ground of Proximity.
kāmyasyaiveti kiṃ naitadayuktataramucyate	It is this Proximity, and not the Proximity of the Dikshaṇīyā, etc., that has been spoken of in the Bhashya.
yadi vinaiva pramāṇena kevalanityārthatvaṃ tvamicchasi hanta madicchayā 'pi kevalakāmyārthatvamevāstu /	If with out any reasons, you should persist in holding that the Procedurs be longs to the Nitya only, simply because you wish it so,well, in that case, why should not it be taken as belonging to the Kamya only, because we wish it so? If this latter view be rejected for want of reasons in support of it, then you should accept the strictly reasonable view that it belongs to both.

But the Accessory could take up the Procedure, only if this latter were connected with the Instruments only, or if the Accessory itself were the qualification of the Bhāvanā. But in the case of that Bhāvanā where the Instrument con sists of the Accessories,inasmuch as there could be no Instru mentality without a particular Rootmeaning, there is always a need for something definitely expressed by the verbal Root, which would serve as the object to be accomplished because mere activity in general could not be brought about by the Accessories.
na tāvatkaragauritikarttavyatā saṃbadhyataityuktam /	Nor is the Accessory capable of serving as a general Instrument, unless it has served to accomplish a particular action.
tattaśca tena tāvatsaha prathamataramarugaṇe kahā yanauvanniyamaḥ /	Consequently, at that particular Bhavana, wherein the existing Accessory takes up the Procedure, the denotation of the Root is found to take the very first place.

As a matter of fact, however, we find that the Rootmeaning leads to a distinct desirable result, and serves to qualify the Bhāvanā which is the way to the taking in of the Procedure and as such, it could not but take up the Procedure. And thus all the following four agencies lead to the taking up of the Procedure by the Rootmeaning without the particular Root meaning the Bhavana is not capable of taking up the Procedure the Accessory also is not capable of doing so, until it has brought up the Rootmeaning because there can be no Bhāvanā wholly indepen dent of the Rootmeaning and because it is absolutely impossible for the mere action to do to be performed and lastly, because the Acces sory itself is not an action the Procedure also, betaking itself to the Accessory, cannot reach it, after having passed over the Root meaning and as such it falls into this latter the Rootmeaning also, being, by itself, in need of the Procedure, is quite capable of taking it up, even though it may have been meant for the Accessory and as such why should it abandon that Procedure ? Thus then, in the case in question, the Ukthya and the other Terminuses that are laid down with reference to distinct desirable results, being recognised as resting in the Jyotishtoma,when they stand in need of a Procedure, they find presented before them, by the Context, such details as the Dikshaniya and the rest and inasmuch as these latter have no other way of reaching those, they inevitably.

The parti cular Procedure is enjoined in this way For the sake of such and such results, the means employed should be the Ukthya, etc., and that in such and such a way,i.e. fulfilment of those results and hence there being a touch of the verb vṛṃ to do, there is a distinct relationship with the Bhāvanā.
evaṃ ca sati nāsti sa pra kāro yena dhātvarthaṃ pariṝtyānayetikarttavyatayokthyādayaḥ sādhakāḥ kriyeran /	Under the circumstances, there is no such way by which the Procedure could make the Ukthya, etc., efficient means of accomplishing the result, independently of the Rootmeaning.

Consequently one who requires a Procedure for the Accessory which would serve as the means, must admit that the Accessory belongs to the Roolmeaning, which is what has to be accomplished.

And even though the Jyotishtoma is present, yet if there be no desire for Cattle or other desirable results. there is no possibility of the Ukthya and other Terminuses.
na tvetāsu jyotiṣṭomaḥ kadā cinnāsti / sarvatra samastātmanā pratyekaṃ jātivatmamavetattvāt /	For certainly, it is not necessary to have one Terminus while we are having the other. Nor are these Terminuses ever devoid of the Jyotishtoma as this inheres, in its entirety, in every one of them, just as the Class does in every one of the Individuals.
ata ete yathāmnātā protiṣṭomena saha saṃbadhyante nānityābhiḥ saṃsthābhiḥ /	Consequently, it must be admitted that the Accessory Details as laid down are related to the permanent Jyotishtoma, and not to the fleeting Terminuses.

And while this condition of relationship with the permanent factor of Jyotishtoma is duly fulfilled, there would be no harm in the Details being, at the same time, related to certain transient factors the Terminuses also.
yadi tu tamanmatyevānityo 'pyaparaḥ saṃbandhaḥ kalpyate kiṃ no bādhyate /	Because it is only when that which is laid down as transient is related to the Permanent that, that there is an incongruity, and not in cases like those we are dealing with.

In a case where, without belonging to the Nitya sacrifice, the Details cannot be laid down as permanent, when the fact of its belonging to the Nitya being ascertained, the requirements of the text are all duly fulfilled,their relationship with the other i.e. the Kāmya comes about by itself and thus too all of them Nitya and Kāmya cannot be regarded as equally related to the enjoined accessories.

satyaṃ prayogavacanayorbhedādavipratiṣedhaḥ prayojāvacanāni tu nityānityaprayogavacanānuvidhānādipratiṣidhyante /	Objection We can resolve the Injunction into two parts one inferred from the Context, and the other from Direct Declaration and of these one would lay down the details as permanent, and the other would enjoin them as transient. Reply True, the contradiction might be avoided by the difference in the Injunctions of the Performances but there would be a distinct selfcontradiction in regard to the prompted details inasmuch as they would be following in the wake of both the permanent and the transitory.
tenaiṣāṃ nityatvāvighātamicchatā 'vaśyaṃ grāhakamapi tamayamevābhyupagantavyam /	Thus then, with a view to keep intact the permanent character of these Details the Dikshaniya and the rest, we must regard the taking up of the procedure also to be permanent.

In reply to the above it is declared Sa nityasya samulvāt. That is to say the two Injunctionsthat of the Details pertaining to the Sacrifice itself, as well as that of those relating to a desired resultare both equal and hence looking into these two, we conclude, in accord ance with the law ēkusya tübhayalvē samyogapṛthakvam IViii, that it is as Nitya that the performance ending with the Agnishtoma is related to the Desire while that which lays down the others i.e.

na hyava dvitīyatṛtīyā divaddiśiṣṭa vidhiravakalpate / vidhipratiṣedhayorvipratiṣedhāt paryudāsāsaṃbhavācca /	Nor can the sentence in question be regarded as containing a qualified Injunction, like the sentence Agneyamajam...... Aindragna Ukthya Dvitiyaḥ, etc., etc., as the Injunction and Prohibition are of such contradictory characters that the one could not be taken along with the other nor is it possible for the sentence to be taken as a Paryudāsa a mere pre clusion of Homa.

Some people argue as follows The Home that is laid down in the text quoted is one that serves as the disposal of the Butter that has been left behind at the Pracarani Homā and hence when this Dis posal will have been effected by the Painting of the Paridhi, there would naturally be a negation of the other Disposal by means of Homa, even if the Terminuses were equally related to the enjoined details that is to say, the said Preclusion is quite compatible with the Purvapaksha also.
pracaraṇohomaśeṣapratipattivaddomasya paridhyanena pratipādite sāmānavidhye 'dhyabhāvaḥ sidhyatīti tatra tu vākyena svatantre vidhīyamāne kathamaprastutaṃ pratipattitvamavagamyataiti vaktavyam /	But when we find the sentence laying down the Homa as an inde pendent action, it should be explained how we could regard it as a mere Disposal of the Remnant. Then again, even though the Disposal may be effected by the Homa, yet it would be quite possible for us to per form the other action of Painting the Paradhi also, in so far as what is directly denoted by the word · Paridhyañjanu` and hence the per formance of one Disposal would not necessarily involve the Nonper formance of the other. Consequently, the mention of negation na juhoti must be taken as indicative of what we have shown above.
guṇaviśeṣādekasya vyapadeśaḥ	Sūtra The specific mention of one is due to the presence of particular Accessories.

prakaraṇaprāptaṃ tvagniṣṭomagrahaṇaṃ nityānuvādaḥ / atha vā stovanimittatvapratipādanaparatvādarthavadevetyadoṣaḥ /	Or, it may be that, it is just possible for the unheard of Accessories to be brought in as if they were heard of, through the introduction of a heard of Action to which those Accessories belong and in that case, the mention of the Agnishtoma in Yadyagnishtomaḥ, etc., whose presence is already indicated by the Context, ,would be by way of a reference to the Nitya action. , its mention may be taken as laying down the fact of the particular action Homa being due to the presence of the particular Hymn of the AgnishtomaSāma and there can be no incongruity in such a mention.

It is quite true that that is the use of the present Dis cussion but this would not be applicable to the case of all Accessory Details. For instance, all the details of the Sadomāna and the like, which are laid down with reference to particular desirable results, even though there be a likelihood of the presence of the other details, by reason of the Implicatory Injunction, yet inasmuch as the parti cular Details would be found to have a substrate the Jyotishtoma which is enjoined by Direct Injunction, these latter could not be totally set aside, as in the case of the other Modifications.

And as this fact of its bringing about an Apūrva is not indicated by Syntactical Connection, it must be regarded as indi cated by Context.

śakya hi havirbarhiḥśabdo prakaraṇena samāveśayituṃ nāhīnavadasaṃbaḍāviti manyate /	Even though the Context cannot serve the purposes of specification, yet it is only through the particular character of being. The word asamyuktam notconnected means that, even though Syntactical connection indicates the connection of the Havi and the Varhi, yet there is no connection with anything that is con trary to not in keeping with the Context.
sarveṣāṃ vākyasaṃyogāviśeṣādityuktameva /	Sūtra They belong to all because the character of the Accessory is not based upon the Context. It has been already shown that all the Details are equally related to Syntactical Connection.
yattu prakaraṇaṃ viśeṣeṇa viniyojakamiti, tatrāhaatatprayuktatvāt / na prakaraṇamiha viśeṣakaṃ bhavatītyarthaḥ /	It has been argued above, that the Context would serve the purpose of prompting the particular factors of actions. It is in re ply to this that we have the clause atatprayuk! atvāt that is to say, the Context does not serve the purposes of the specification.
yattu virodho nāstīti kathaṃ nāsti yadā havirbarhiṣāṃ prādhānyātpratyekaṃ dharmasaṃbandhe satyaṅa gārthatvamapi jñāyamānaṃ prakaragānurodhena vyāvarcyate /	Then again, it has been argued above that there is no contra diction between Syntactical Connection and the Context. But why should there be no contradiction, when we find that, in asmuch as due predominance attaches to the Havish and the Varhi, if these accessory details were related to everyone of the Actions, they would come to be recognised as belonging to the Subsidiaries also and this has got to be set aside in view of the Context.
parastu yena kāraṇena vākyasyātiprasare bādhite nirvirodhaṃ prakaraṇamavagatavānidānoṃ tadupanyasyati laukike 'pi prāpnoti tataścānarthakyami ti /	of the too extensive application of this Syntactical Connection having been precluded The Details would come to be performed in connec. tion with the Varhi, etc., employed in ordinary actions also and at these, they would be absolutely useless.
tasyottarametadeva vaktavyam /	To this we offer the following reply The Syntactical Connection, in its natural functioning, can be set aside from that only where it would be actually useless.

The Bhashya has used the word prakaraṇāt, with a view to avoiding of the too extensive application of the Syntactical Connection But this declaration, at the present stage, would bar the way of the objection contained in the next Sūtra and hence it must be regarded as put forward too soon and as such to be disregarded on the present occasion.

As for the Saurya and other such Subsidiaries of the Darça Purnamāsa, even according to the Pürvapaksha view, the presence in Pinḍapitryajña of the Darça Purnamāsa which, as being entirely devoid of the Details, either by Direct Injunction or by Implication, should be taken as the basis of the present Discussion.
tenātyantāniṣṭaprasaṅga iti /	That this Pindapitryajña is an entirely new sacrifice, and is not a subsidiary will be shown later on in Adhyāya IX and hence the acceptance of the Siddhanta view with regard to this yajña would lead to most undesirable consequences.
na tadākyaṃ hi tadarthatvāt	Sūtra Reply Not so because of the sentence being Syntactically connected with the Darça Purnamasa,a shown by the fact of its being subservient to it.

As a matter of fact however, the sentence, that lays down the Grass, the Altar, and their various Details, is syntactically connected with the Darça Pūrṇamāsa that is to say, with the sentence laying down the Darça Purnamāsa. And for this reason the Details laid down in these sentences must be regarded as belonging to those Grass and Altar, etc., which are spoken of in the sentence that is so connected, and with those mentioned in other sentences.
na ca piṇḍa pitṛyajñabarhirdarśapūrṇamāsavākyāntargatamato na saṃbhansyata iti /	As for the Pindapitryajña, it is not found to be mentioned in the sentence laying down the Darça Pūrṇamāsa and as such it could never be related to these Details.

If the meaning of the sentence Varhishi āsādayati keeps upon the grass were assumed to be that the material is kept upon that grass which has been brought in for the sake of the Darça Pūrṇamāsa,then alone could the Details be taken as belonging to the Darça Pūrṇamāsa only.
naiṣa doṣaḥ /	As a matter of fact, such is not the case.
sarvathā lavanakhananādayaḥ tāvanna sācādaṅagena pradhānena vā saṃbandhuṃ śaknuvanti yava vedibarhiṣī tatra gamiṣyanti vedibarhiṣorapi havirāsādanena saṃbandhaḥ / tacca darśapūrṇamāmaprayogavacanagṛhītamāsādanaṃ saṃbadhyate evamaṅga havirāsādanamapi tatrāntargataṃ sāgasya pradhānasyaika prayogatvāt /	As when, in order to avoid the uselessness of the Details, we make it step beyond the mere form of the Darça Pūrṇamāsa Sacri fice, should we take them as referring to that grass which is brought in for the sake of the Darça Pürṇamāsa, or to that which helps in the accomplishment of these Sacrifices? If we accept the former alterna tive, then the sentence would become too limited in its scope while the latter alternative affords it a more extensive scope and it is incumbent upon us to accept that theory which should give the greatest scope possible to the sentence in question. The Subsidiaries of Subsidiaries also are regarded as helping in the accomplishment of the Primary Sacrifice, even though they may not be directly for the sake of this latter and we have seen that it is the mere fact of helping, and not that of its being for its sake, that constitutes the ground of relationship as when a detail is contained in that which does not in any way help the Sacrifice, it cannot accord any help to it which can not be said with regard to that which is not contained in that which is not for the sake of that.
nanu ca yathā prayājādaya ekaprayogavacanagṛhītatve 'pi guṇānāṃ ca parārthatvādityevaṃ tṛtīyādhyāyasya saptamaḥ pāda /	As a matter of fact, even without being for the sake of the Primary, we find the Curd and the Milk merely helping in the Abhyuditeshti and yet they become connected with the Details of the Pranita. For these reasons we accept, on the ground of Context, the fact of the sentence in question being syntactically connected with that which lays down the Darça Purnamāsa,the construction being transcendental result of the Darça Purnamāsa is not duly accom.
parasparāṅagatvaṃ na pratipadyante tathāṅa gahaviḥmaṃbandhaṃ bahinna pratipadyate /	And inasmuch as we find the imperfections in the materials of Subsi. diary Sacrifices causing discrepancies in the Result of the Primary Sacrifice, we must admit the connection, with the subsidiaries also, of those Details which are due to the transcendental result of the Primary Sacrifice.
naitadevama /	Sutra Also because of Indications.
yathaiva hi pradhānahavirāsāinamaṅagatayā saṃbadhyate tathāṅa gahavirāmodanamapi aṅa gāṅagatayā saṃbhansyate /	It is only when such Details, as those in question, are accepted as belonging to the Primary as well as to the Subsidiary,that the Abhighāraṇa, spoken of in the sentence Prayājaçeshēṇa havimshyā gharayati, could be taken as belonging to both the Primary and the Subsidiary and then alone could we justify the declaration Sa vai dhruvāmēvagrē, etc., wherein we have an Order spoken of as a well established fact, and hence appearing as a Hēluvannigada giving reasons for a certain Injunction,Vide Iii et.

Otherwise, for the Dhruva also, we could have the Abhigharaṇa only as connected with the Upamçuyāja and in that case there could be no further Abhigharanas and as such, it would be absolutely useless to put forward the reason Tato hi prathamāvājya. Sutra That which is related to the Master of the sacrifice belongs to the Primary because of the mention of Results.
yadi tādarthyaṃ gṛhyate vākāsyātidūraṃ saṃkocaḥ kriyeta /	That is to say, if the Details in question belonged to the Master in the character of the Performer, then they could be taken as pertain ing to all the Sacrifices.
tadupakāritvagrahaṇe tu bahutara viṣayatvaṃ bhavati / yathā ca tadbhavati tadanugrahotavyam /	Consequently, just as there are many other Subsidiaries bringing about imperceptible results which, while creating a capability for experiencing results, do not fall off from their subsidiary character,so, in the same manner, we would have in the case of the Purificatory Details under consideration.
aṅgāṅgamapi vinā'pi tādarthyena tadupakāroti vijñāyate /	fulfilment of the Result depends upon the due performance of the Primary together with its Subsidiaries. Consequently, the Altar being regarded as belonging to the Primary as performed along with the Subsidiaries, it might belong to these latter also.
tāvanmāvameva ca tadddārayuktaṃ na tādarthyam anupakāriṇi hi sthitaṃ nopakaroti nātadayeṃ tathā ca parāyeṃ tvarthatāmānyamiti vakṣyati /	Against this explanation of the Bhashya we have the following objections The Declaration, that because the Accusative ending indicates the Touching as an accessory action, therefore it must be regarded as belonging to all Sacrifices is not quite relevant. Because the discussion itself was started on the very supposition that the Touching is an accessory and as a matter of fact also, the Accusative ending, whose denotation follows that of the basic nouns Paurņamāsi and Amāvāsyā which denote the two Primary Sacri fices, shows that the Touching is of those materials that are used at the Primary Sacrifices, and as such it could not prove what is desired by the Siddhanti.
vinā 'pi tādarthyenābhyuditeṣṭyāṃ dadhipayasostadupakāramāvadarśanātmaṇautādharmaprāptirbhavatoti /	Then as for the fact of the Touching being for the sake of the Amāvāsyā and the Paurnamāsi Sacrifices, brought forward by the Bhashya,that only supports the Purvapaksha view.
tasmādevaṃ prakaraṇādekavākyatvaṃ kalpyate yasminnakriyamāṇe darśapūrṇamāsāpūrvaṃ na sidhyati taba tatva kataṃvyā iti śraṅgahavirbhirapi ca viguṇaiḥ pradhānāpūrvaṃ na niṣpadyate /	Conse quently the sentence must be taken as restricting the Touching to the particular time or performance of the laurnamã si Sacrifice as a whole and consequently there should be a Touching of every one of the materials used at that Sacrifice whether in connection with the Primary or its Subsidiaries. Even if the word Paurnumäsi were to indicate the offering material, then too, in as much as it would indicate the help accorded to it by the Touching, this Touching could not but be regarded as belonging to all the offering materials.
tasmātpradhānāpūrvaprayuktānā mevā'ṅgeṣvapi kriyā yukteti /	And hence, in accordance with the Law of the Sutra vii, the Fees come to be related to the Performance of the Primary along with the Subsidiary Sacrifices and hence they must be regarded as belonging to all of these.
yadi caivaṃjātīyakamaṅgapradhānārthaṃ tataḥ prayājaśeṣeṇa havīṃṣyabhivārathatītyetadaṅgapradhānārtham /	Then again, it is a perceptible fact that the Priests, obtained by means of the payment of the Sacrificial Fee, perform the Subsi diary Sacrifices also otherwise if the Fee pertained to the Primary only, the Priests, being paid for performing the Primary only, would not have performed the Subsidiaries while as a matter of fact we find that the Master does not pay them for performing the Primary only as that would not serve his purpose hence it must be admit ted that the Fee is related to every one of these Actions, which the Priests are made to perform by means of the payment of the Fee.
tatra ca kramavākya ṣvayaṃ kramo nyāyaprāptaḥ siḍabaducyamāno hetuvannigado 'rthatvādupapadyate sa vai bhruvāmevāi 'bhighāratantravārtike yati /	This fact of the Performer being common to all the Actions will be fully explained in Adhyaya XI. The Initiations and the Sacrificial Fee belong to the Primary Sacrifice only, because of such direct declarations as Dikshaḥ soma sya, Dakshiņāḥ somasya. As for the Injunction with regard to the Initiated in connection with the Subsidiaries, it must be taken as referring to the Person who has been initiated at the Primary Sacrifice as otherwise we would have to have recourse to a most useless Secondary Indication.
kutastato hi prathamāvājyabhāgau yaccanbhavatīti / yadyājābhāgahavirapyabhighāraṇoyaṃ tata evaṃ vaktavyam /	, it is not right to introduce the present Adhikaraṇa here. Reply The former Adhikarana should be taken as preceded by the present one because when the Altar will have been cognized, through Syntactical Connection, as subservient to the Post, wherefore should arise any question as to what the Altar is subservient. Whereas, when the mention of the Altar has been shown to be indicative of a particular place as is done in the present case then naturally arises the question considered in Adhi.
anyathā hi bhuvāyāmupāṃśuyājārthena kevalamabhidhāraṇaṃ syāt / tatra na cāye 'bhivāraṇaṃ syānna ca tato hi prathamāvājyabhāgāviti hetuḥ samadhyḙta /	Setting aside the indication of the Context, the Altar must be regarded, through Syntactical Connection, as belonging to the Post otherwise it would be necessary to have recourse to Secondary Indica tion. And so long as we do not find any incongruity in the word Inner Altar being taken in its direct primary signification, we have no reason to have recourse to Secondary Indication. Consequently, the general declarationJyati çakshyāmahe,etc. being taken as pertaining to the particular case of the Post, the Altar should be taken as subservient to the Post. Or, in accordance with the previous Adhikarana , the Altar being taken as Subservient to the Jyotishtoma together with all its Subsidiaries, there would arise the question as to whether, or not it is subservient to the Post.
tasmātsarvārthatvamiti /	And on this too, we would have the same Purvapaksha.
yājamānāstu tatpradhānatvātkambhavadityanenādhikaragona yeṣāṃ yājamānatvaṃ siddhaṃ te kiṃ yajamānasya ka tṛtvāṃśenāṅagapradhānāthī uta bhoktṛtvāṃśena kevalapradhānātha iti /	Objection The very fact of its being subservient to all shows that it is subservient to the Post also and as such there can be no use in any enquiry on this point. Reply The Subservience to the Post is not proved by the subservience to the subsidiaries of the Jyotishtoma as the Post is subsidiary to the Paçusacrifice and not to the Jyotishṭoma and what has been proved in the previous Adhikarana is that the Altar is subservient to the Jyotishtoma together with its subsidiaries, and not that it is so to the Paçusacrifice.
kiṃ prāptaṃ pūrveṇādhikarīna sarvārthatvaṃ savarthe hi yajamāne 'vasthitāḥ śaknuvanti sarveṣāmupakarttuṃ na ca vyāvṛttikāraṇa mastauti prāpte 'bhiṣoyate /	Sacrifice itself, which makes it over to the subsidiaries of the Jyotish toma. Reply This would have been possible if the Altar, by itself, belonged to the PaçuSucrifice as a matter of fact, however, it comes into this latter, through the Primary Sacrifice and hence it must be taken as resting in the Paçusacrifice itself and could not be relegated to the Subsidiaries. And when it is found that an Altar is necessary at the Paçusacrifice, it is the Altar of the Somasacrifice Jyotishṭoma that enters into it, through Implication, after having precluded the entrance of the Altar of the DarçaPurnamāsa.
yenetra hetunaiteṣāṃ svāmigāmitvaniścayaḥ /	And this Altar of the Somasacrifice is used only for certain purposes in connection with the Original Primary sacrifice.
tenaiva tu pradhānārthapratipattirapi sphuṭā graṅa gāṅa gibhāve hi yūpo vā vedyaṅgaṃ bhavet vedirvā yūpāṅgaṃ na caikamapyupapadyate nirākāṅacatvādadṛṣṭakalpanāt vākyabhedaprasaṅagācca /	The measuring of the Post spoken of in the sentence in question, is not, in any way, con nected with the Primary sacrifice and as such, it could not pertain to the Post. Sutra The Sentence must be taken as laying down merely a particular point of space because it is syntactically connected with that which is not meant to be enjoined according to you. The two words Antarvēdi and Vahirvēdi indicate the middle point and the sentence does not lay down any relation of subser vienoy between the Altar and the Post. Because in all cases the mention of that which has already served its purpose is accepted as being for the sake of the specification of Time and Place and in the case in question we find that both the Altar and the Post have already served their purposes elsewhere.
nāpi karṭahavistadupakaraṇa dhāraṇatryāpṛtāyā vede sahasrabhāgāṃśasaṃbandhini yūpe 'pekṣā na cānyatarasya dṛṣṭopakāritvamava kalpate /	As a matter of fact, however none of these is possible because each has had its requirements fulfilled because any such relation ship would involve the assumption of an imperceptible result and lastly, because of its occasioning a syntactical split. That is to say, the Post which is used for the tying of the animal does not stand in need of the Altar and the Altar too, being used as the seat of the Performer and as the place for the keeping of the offering material and its accessories, does not stand in need of the Post, which occupies only a thousandth very small part of its space. Nor are these two capable of producing any visible effect in each other.
matyace tu dvābhyāṃ vinā deśaviśeṣopalakṣaṇāsaṃbhavādavaśayaṃ śāsitavyametat /	Then again, the factor of Ardham vahirvēdi cannot be meant to be enjoined as according to you, it is capable of neither Injunction nor a descriptive Reference while according to you it is necessary to take this also as Enjoined because until we have both Ardhamantarvedi and ‘Ardhamvahirvēdi distinctly enjoined, we could not get at the specifi cation of the particular point in the Post i.e.
kathaṃ samastasya yūtantravārtika /	the point where the Inner meets the Outer Altar.
pasyāntarbahirvā māne prāpte īmantaveṃdauti niyamyate dvitīya sthāīsya punarapyaniyamaprasaktau aīṃ bahiveṃdotyapi vidhātavyam / tataścānekārthatvāḍākyabhedo minotyākhyātānuṣaṅa gakleśaca prasajyate /	Specially as according to you the whole of the Post being recognised as to be measured either inside or out, the sentence Ardhamantarvēdi serves to enjoin the measuring of half of it as to be done at the Inner Altar and then the measuring of the second half being doubtful, the other sentence could not but be taken as serving the same purpose with regard to this other half and thus ere being a multiplicity of objects enjoined, there would be a distinct Syntactical Split and also there would be the further complication of connecting the verb Minoti both ways and lastly, a part will have to be taken as a mere descriptive reference to what already exists. Objection The connection of one half of the Post with the Inner Altar having been enjoined by the former sentence, there being no Injunction with regard to the other half, it would come to be dealt with at the Outer Altar.
bhavedevaṃ yadi nityamantarvedi bahiveṃdova vā yūpamānaṃ prasakta syātsamastāntarvediprasaṅage hisatyaīpunarvacana sāmarthyātparisaṃkhyāyetarasya bahirmānaṃ ga myeta samastasya vā bahireva prasaṅage 'sthāvihitamiti tadavasya mantara madhyavasoyeta /	Reply This would have been the case if there were a possibility of the Post being dealt with either at the Inner Altar, or at the Outer Altar, exclusively. As a from the Inner Altar, and connect it with the Outer one and conversely, if the whole were cognised as to be dealt with at the Outer Altar, the mention over again of the other half would connect this with the Inner Altar, to the preclusion of the Outer ono.
ataścedvaśamavadhāraṇamardhamantarvedova na tvaīmevāntaveṃdoti tathā sati cāntaramaniyatatvātkaṭā cidantarapi prāpnotīti na bahirbhāva miyatīti / nanu ca yadi samastamantarveti minoti tato 'īmantarvedauti evaṃ vidhinaiva kuryyāt /	matter of fact, however, we find neither of these to be the case and hence the sentonce Ardhamanlarvedi must be taken as Ardhaman tarvedyēva half of it is dealt with at the Inner Altar only, and not as Ardhamēva antarvedi only half is to be dealt with at the Inner Altar. And thus nothing definite being known with regard to the other half, this latter could, sometimes, be dealt with at the Inner Altar also and hence there could be no dealing with the Outer Altar exclusively. Objection In case the whole of the Post be dealt with at the Inner Altar, we could not have the Injunction in the form of Ardham,etc. which mentions only one half .” Reply Why could we not have it in this form, when what it lays down is the fact of one half of the Post being dealt with always at the Inner Altar, while it does not preclude the Outer Altar with regard to the other half. For these reasons we conclude that both the sentences together lay down a particular point of space, qualified by both the Inner and the Outer Altar,i.c.

Reply Because in the present case the two alternatives are not distinctly mentioned. That is to say, in the present case we do not find that the factor in question is enjoinable for us, and ‘not enjoina ble for our opponent. Question In that case, how do you establish your Siddhanta? Answer In the following manner Sūtra The sentence must be taken as laying down mere place as the Havirdhana serves a distinctly visible purpose for the Soma.
sāmidhenaustadanvāhariti havi nayorvacanātsāmidhenīnām	As a matter of fact we find that the Havirdhana has its use justified by its serving the purpose of holding the Soma. serviency between the Havirdhana and the Sāmīdhenis.

That is to say, any one of the two Havirdhana carts are recognised as making a place in connection. with the original Sacrifice, and in this way the said general relation ship is duly established and hence it becomes a comparatively easy matter for the sentence to lay down merely the specialisation of that relationship. For this reason also, we must take the sentence as indicating the place.
yathā satyapi varaṇe ṛtuyajanasaṃbandhe ca kāraṇahayāsaṃbhavācca masādhvayaṃva ṛtvijo noktāḥ /	But in that case also, it will be necessary to explain, how it is that the Bhāvanā being expressed by the Injunctive Affix, and recognised, through Proximity, as to be performed by the person desiring the Result the Nominative, as well as the Bhāvanā, is denoted by the affix, and hence the proximity, the Nominative agency with regard to the accomplishment of this Bhāvanā is restricted to the Instrumental factor of the yāga only.
svāminastu yadyapi ca varaṇaṃ nāsti tathā 'pyanyatsarvaṃmastīti yuktamutviktvam /	The Purchase Payment is, by its very nature, done with regard to another Person, and not to ones self as it is not possible for payment to be made to ones self. Consequently, if, at sometime, the Master himself should perform the Subsidiaries,there could be no Payment for services in that case, as any such would be an absolute impossibility and this would be a direct infringement of the Injunction of this Payment as a necessary factor in connection with the Subsidiaries.

Then again, in as much as the various persons, laid down in the originative Injunc tion, as to be Appointed, can neither be rejected, nor taken as optional alternatives, nor as all at once conjointly,one sentence laying down the appointment of a certain person could not be connected with the Person appointed in accordance with another Sentence and for this reason also, the Appointments must be regard ed as distinct and diverse.

Nor could this justify our taking all the Sentences Brahmaṇam vrnita, Hotaram vrņīta, etc., as syntactically connected, and leading to a result in the shape of the cognition of the Numberwhich is obtainable by the much easier method of taking the Sentences collectively.
evaṃ kartabhedaṃ pratipādodānoṃ samākhyāviniyogasya pūrvapakṣaṃ racayati sma tatva te sarvārthā iti/	To the above we make the following reply Inasmuch as all Names are based upon distinctness, as the Camasādhvaryus are mentioned as equally distinct from all the other Priests, as there is a distinct Appointment laid down for these Camasadhvaryusthey must be regarded as distinct from those other Priests, as shown on a previous occasion.
na jñāyate kiṃ kratṛtīyādhyāyasya saptamaḥ pāda /	Sūtra It cannot be so because of the preclusion of others besides the Seventeen. The expression Parisaḥkhyānāt in the Sūtra has been explained by the Bhashya as referring to the fact of the sentence Saptadaça Rivijaḥ being a Preclusive Injunction.
svarthapuruṣārthābhiprāyasuta kratvarthasarvārthābhiprāyam tacā'pi kiṃ vākyasaṃyukta sarvārthā utā'saṃyukta sarvārthāḥ /	In all cases, we find that whenever two things are spoken of as bearing some sort of a relationship to each other, the following three factors are therein involved the mere forms of the things their mutual connection and the preclusion of a third thing and a sentence is always meant to convey the idea of one of these factors according to the wish of the speaker. And in a case where either the form of the things or their mutual connection is not meant to be expressed, as in the case in question, we cannot but take the Injunction as serving the purpose of precluding the things other than those mentioned.
yadi tāvatū puruṣārthā apotyabhiprāyaḥ sa varaṇabharaṇayoḥ prakaraṇāmnānena kratvarthatvādayuktaḥ /	The Opponent however still accepts the performance of the Sacrifice to be the sole condition of the application of the name Rtvik and hence concludes that whoever may be found to fulfil that condition must be spoken of as Rtvik it is with a view to all this that we have the passage in the Bhashya Nunu prati shidhyanyeshvapi,etc. C i In replying to this, the Siddhanti begins with showing that it is the Action that is denied.
prakaraṇa viśeṣāhā tadyuktasya tatsaṃskāro dravyavadivyādiṣu /	It might be argued that it is the fact of being appointed that is the condition or basis of the applicatoin of the name and as such the oiting of the instance of the functions pertaining to the Rtvik is wholly irrelevant.

nāpi saṃyukteṣu tānpuro 'dhvayaṃvibhajatītyādiśrutānāmanyeṣāmavataraṇamastīti /	Objection The Character of Rtvik also does not exist with regard to the particular persons concerned. Reply True but that character we do not find to be produced, even after the Appointment.
yāni tvasaṃyuktāni kāryyāṇi tāni yatra tatra vede paṭhitāni yena kena citkartā yathāsāmarthyaṃ karttavyānauti sarvārthā /	If it be urged that whatever is produced by the Appointment is the Character of Rtvik,then, that would be nothing else besides their being won over. Nor is the Rtvik character an imperceptible entity as that alone can be regarded as imperceptible whose functions are found to be so. The functions of the Rivik, which consist of the accomplishment of the Action, are quite perceptible and how could this perceptible effect. be brought about by means of an imperceptible agency? Specially as all that is found to bring about the accomplishment of the action is quite perceptible, in the shape of Brāhmaṇahood and the rest.

And further we find that all Sacri fices appoint the Sadasya separately. For all these reasons it is not right to exclude the Sadasya from the Seventeen Priests. C Reply We do not exclude the Sadasya from all connection with the Sacrifice all that we mean is that, like the Camasādhvaryu, he cannot be called a Rtvik. The Sadasya is certainly to be appointed separately.
ye punarāhavanīyādayasteṣāṃ sarvārthatvamaprastutameva na ca prasaṅgāducyate / khakālatvasya hetorapyasamarthatvāt /	But, the Sadasya is not spoken of as a Rtvik because though the name applies to one who has been appointed and who performs the Sacrifices at particular seasons, yet he is not mentioned among the Recipients of the Sacrificial Fee, nor in the sentence laying down the Dwäādaçāha Initiation for Priests. Just as even though the Camasadhvaryus fulfil the two conditions of being appointed, and performing the Sacrifice, etc., inasmuch as they do not fulfil the other two conditions, they are not spoken of as Rtviks.
na ca tasyottarapace kaścitpakṣasya hetova parāmarśo 'sti /	As for the Master, on the other hand, though he is not appointed, yet, inasmuch as he fulfils all the other conditions, it is only right that he should be spoken of as a Rtvik.

The mere witnessing is no action connected with the actual performance of the Sacrifice and as such that could not be any ground for his being taken as a particular Performer of the Sacrifice. Sutra The Priests would perform all Actions, as they are appointed for that purpose.

On this question, the Bhashya puts forward the Pūrvapaksha, that They would perform all the Actions, becauseetc. etc. But we do not quite understand whether the question refers to the doubt as to the Priests performing only the actions pertaining to the Sacrifice or those pertaining to the Sacrificer also, or it refers to that as to their performing all actions pertaining to the Sacrifice or all the actions those pertaining to the Sacrifice as well as those pertaining to the Sacrificer.
siddhāntavacana mevaitannirākaraṇoktyabhāvāt /	Then again, we do not understand whether all actions spoken of are those only that are mentioned in connected sentences or those that are not so expressly mentioned.

And as for those actions that are not expressly mentioned in such sentences, these, being found to be laid down at random anywhere in the Veda, could be performed by any persons capable of such perform ance, without restriction and as such with reference to these alone the Priests may be spoken of as sarvärthah. The phrase prayuktatvät means because all the actions are capable of prompting the appointment of the Priest and also because all the Priests are capable of performing all the actions Says the Bhashya sarvam purushakāryam and this refers to those actions which the man is capable of performing, and which he would perform, if certain direct declarations had not pointed out only some of them as to be performed by him and it cannot be taken as referring to the Actions pertaining to the man i.e..

tadetadvarṇitaṃ sarvārthaṃ vā''dhānasya svakālatvādityava /	Nor does sarvärtha refer to the functions of the Fire but it refers to the Primary Original and the subsidiary modifications. The Fires must be regarded as belonging to the Primary Original, just like all details not laid down in any particular context in accordance with the Sutra Prakṛtan vā dviruktutvāt .
na tvetatsarva viṣayaṃ savārthatvamavakalpate /	Reply The sarvārtha mentioned in the present Sutra cannot be the same as that spoken of in connection with the Adhana.
dvāraṃ yeṣu parādhīnaṃ teṣu tatprātyapekṣayā / prāpnuvantaudṛśā bhāvā na svatantrāḥ kathaṃ cana	Because if we rested on the former Adhikarana only, such things as the Fire in question would appear in accordance with the appearance of those things the means whereof is dependent upon something else, and not when they would be independent as in the case in question and hence the Sacrificial Fires would belong only to those DarviHomas Sacrifices as they would not be enjoined with regard to these.

So also, with regard to the Caru and Purodāças used at the Modificatory Sacrifices, there being no Direct Injunction of the Preparation of the offering material, there would be no direct means available for the appearance of the Gārhapatya Fire and hence it becomes necessary seek for the Preparation together with the Garhapalya Fire, to appear from out of the Primary Original Sacrifice.
prakṛtau vā viruktatvādityayaṃ niścayo bhavet	Sūtra There would be restriction of actions to be performed by each Priest because of the mention of names these being mentioned for that purpose, Because of the presence of Names of the Priests and the Actions performed by them, there must be a restriction.

Because it is only when the relationship be tween a certain word and a particular thing has been previously established, that it serves as the ground of that word being taken as the name of that thing in the case in question, however, we find that before the recognition of the names, there is no relationship between the words Hotr and Hautra on the one hand, and the Performer and the Action on the other. That is to say, the word Hotr is not based upon the perform ance of the Hautra action because, as in the case of the word Rājā not being based upon the performance of the Rajyas, kingly duties, so in the present case also, we have no declaration of Pāṇini authorising the elimination of the affix an and the redupli cation of the basic noun both of which contingencies would be in volved in the word Hotr being taken as equivalent to Hantrasya kartā, the Performer of the Hautra actions.
uktametacchabdasārūpyamāvāditi /	And though in the case of the words Rājā and Rajya, the converse holds good,i.e.
na ttvetadaktam /	And from all this we conclude that the names cannot serve the purpose of pointing out which actions are to be performed by which Priests.

tathā ca vakṣyati/ na hi kaṇvarathantare rathaṃtarasabandhaḥ kaścidastīti /	Then again, the mere similarity of sounds between two words does not always point to any relationship between their denotations e.g. in the case of the words Çālā house and Mālā garland as we shall show, later on, that there is no relationship between the Rathantara and the Kanvarathantara though the two words resemble each other.
yadapi ca kṛte rājñaḥ karmasaṃbandhe rājyaśabdaḥ pravarttataiti /	It has been argued above that the word Rajya is used only when the King Rājā has become connected with certain definite duties.
ta māyaiva tava nityayoreva śabdārthayonnityaeva saṃbandhe śāsvataḥ pratauyamāne sādhutvapratipattivelāyāṃ rājaśabdamanvākhyāya rājyaśabdo 'nvākhyāyamāno yaugikastantrimittaścocyamāno'pi nityanimittatvānnādimatvaṃ pratipadyate tathaivāla hauvamiti vṛddhidarśanāḍoṭaśabdāttasyedaṃ katyevamanvākhyānamiti gamyate /	But this is not so as in that case, the relationship of the word Rājya with its denotation would come to have a beginning and this would be contradictory to what has been said, in the Tarka pāda, in regard to the eternality of this relationship. Consequently, it must be admitted that, what happens in the case of the word Rājya is that its relationship with its denotation is eternal, and this eternal relationship is recognised from the scriptures, and when we come to comprehend the correctness of the form of the word, we explain the word Rajya after the word Rājā has been explained the former being explained as Rājñaḥ karma and as such it comes to be taken in its etymological sense and hence even though the significa. tion of the word Rajya, is thus spoken of as based upon that of Rājā, yet inasmuch as this basis too is eternal, the said relationship does not lose its eternal character exactly in the same manner, inas much as in the word Hautra, we find the vowelsound of the first letter broadened from ö into au, we come to explain it as formed from the word hotr with the affixan, in accordance with the Sutra tasyēdam karma .
kena tu tattasya kamrmāvagatamiti samākhyādarśanāttadeva tādṛśaṃ vacanamanumāsyāmahe /	we shall infer the existence of a Text to the effect that the Actions called Hautra constitute the Duty of the Pricst called Hotr .
samākhyā tāvatpratītirupeṇa pratyakṣā / sā tu kena nimittena pravṛtteti pūrvapravṛttatayaiva nimittama paiṃcate/	Objection Under the circumstances, there would be a mutual interdependence the Text being assumed from the Names, and the application of the Names being based upon the Text declaring the fact of the actions as to be performed by a particular Priest.
yathā hotrā karttavyametaditi sarveṣveva liṅgādiṣvevametadbhavatīti vyākhyātamato neteratarāśrayatvamiti / nanu cedamākhyā caivaṃ tadarthatvā dityanenaivādhikaraṇena siddham /	Reply That does not affect our case because the Names are distinctly perceived to be applicable to the Actions and the Performer and when we come to look into the basis of their application, we find that they could not stand in need of a basis for their application, simply because of their having been previously applied to the Action and the Performer and as we do not find any other basis for this, we con clude that there must be a Text to the effect that the action called Hautra is to be done by the Hotr we have explained above that the assumption of such Texts is made in this manner, even in the case of Indicative Force and the rest and thus there is no mutual inter dependence in the case in question.

upadeśātmihe samākhyābādhe samastaikadeśaviṣayaśvena vicāra /	It having been established that the indications of Name are set aside by Direct Injunction, we now proceed to consider the question, as to whether they are set aside wholly, or only partially.
jyotiṣṭomapra kara gāevaita ccyate / ta smānmaivāvaruṇaḥ praiṣyati cānu cāheti pradarśanārthaṃ gnauṣomīyaityuktam /	In connection with the Jyotishloma, we find the sentenceTasmān Maiträvarunah preshyati canuçaha ca and with a view to show the exact place where the sentence occurs, the Bhashya mentions the Agnishomiya. The two actions spoken of in this sentence ie. Reciting and Directing are found to be named Adhvaryava and Hautra respectively and these names distinctly indicate the fact of all Reciting being done by the Adhvaryu, and all Directing boing done by the Hotr whereas we find the sentence quoted directly laying down that these two actions are to be done by the Mailrävaruna Priest.
tatkimanena upadeśena samastaviṣayaḥ samākhyayorbādha uta kka cideveti /	And hence there arises the question as to whether this Direct Injunc tion rejects the Indications of the two Names, with regard to all Recitings and Directings, or only with regard to only a few of these.

The sentence in question could not apply to all Recitings and Directings it must be taken as applying to the Reciting of the Puronuvākyā verses only as it is only these verses that end with certain Directive words and it is in connection with these verses that we find the Direct Injunction under consideration.
preṣāntānyanuvacanāni puronuvākyastāśca prakṛtyetadvacanaṃ pravṛttam /	At the end of the Puronuvākyā verses, we find the word yaju Sacrifice, in the Imperative, and this sacrificing is found to belong, by Implication, to the Adhvaryu, in connection with subsidiary modifi cations of the Ishlisacrifices.
tasmānmaivāvaruṇa iti /	seq. and in that case the Directing would be done by the Holy himself.
vākyāsutantravārtika / tāca tādṛśyo hauaeva paṭhitā iti tasyaiba kevalasya prāpnuvanti /	Similarly, inasmuch as with regard to the Adhvaryu we find a distinct Directive word laid down in the sentence Adh varyoh praishyal etc., we must preclude the word yāja from all connection with him and hence in this case, it would come to belong to the Pratiprasthäty Priest.

And in this manner, the word ca also in the sentence comes to be taken in its direct sense of the concomitance or aceruing together of the two actions of Reciting and Directing, which is possible in the case of the Puronuvákyā verses only as it is only these that are found to end in Directive words also.
na ca praṣyetyādayo'pi praiṣāstasyaivātmaviṣayāḥ saṃbhavanti /	But it does not follow from this that the Directive words Praishya and the rest also belong to the Maitrāvaruna himself.

sā nāma viśeṣasamākhyā sāmānyasamākhyāṃ bāghate yā tannirapekṣā pravarttate camasādhvaryu samākhyā tu camaseṣvadhvaryya vad vṛttiṃ pratipādayati /	The indications of the generic Name are set aside by those of the specific one, only when the latter operates independently of the former, As a matter of fact, however, we find that the name · Camasädhvaryu only denotes the fact of the persons thus named acting like the Adhvaryu with regard to the Cups, and so this name is not indepen dent of the Adhvaryu.
tadyadi tāvadadhvavyunnaiva juhuyānna tarhi tān juhutaste camasādhvaryyavo bhavanti /	And under the circumstances, if the Adh varyu were not to perform the Homa, the other Priests performing it would not be acting like the Adhvaryu in fact it would be only by not performing the Homa that they would be acting like him.
yadi tu sa juhoti tataḥ kadā cittasya vyāṭatatvenāśaktau satyāṃ te juhṛtastaddadbhaveyustasmājjuhotyadhvaryuḥ /	While if the Adhvaryu perform the Homa, then it might happen that ou certain occasions, the Adhvaryu being otherwise engaged, the Homa might be done by others, who would thus come to be acting like the Adhvaryu. Hence it must be admitted that the Homa is performed by the Adhvaryu.

Then, as a matter of fact, we find that the Name Audgātra of the Primary would apply to the Subsidiaries only through the said assumed sentence and even though this is directly perceptible, yet it is weaker than the inferred Implicatory Injunction.
yāvaccātideśenāṅgāni prāpyante tāvatkasya karttāraṃ niyacchati yadā tu prāptāni bhavanti tadaiṣāṃ klṛptakartṛsaṃbandhānna kaṃdā cidapekṣeti kiṃ samākhyā kariṣyati /	Because until the Subsidiaries are laid down by this latter Injunction, whose performer would the said assumed sentence point out? Hence being preceded by the Implicatory Injunction, the assumed sentence becomes very much weaker in authority. Then again, as soon as the subsidiaries are laid down, they are always recog.

Nor is it possible, in the present case, to take the name as setting aside what has been pre viously pointed out because inasmuch as it is necessary for the Name to assume a corroborative Direct Declaration, it is very much farther removed from its objective than the Implicatory Injunction specially as we have already explained above that only those means of knowledge that have their basis duly ascertained, can set aside what has been laid down before and not those whose basis has still got to be ascertained.

Though at the Primary Original also, multiplicity of Per formers is due to the Names Hot and the rest, yet, inasmuch as in this case, the relationship of these Performers with the performance is duly ascertained, the Indication of Name is accepted to be as authoritative as Direct Declaration itself.

It is with a view to this that the Sūtra adds Avyaktāh Çēṣē. That is to say, in the case of such Details, inasmuch as the relationship to any particular Performer has yet got to be assumed, it is not clear and as such this could apply to actions other than those with regard to which this relationship has already been ascertained.

If the former, then, in that case, their Performer would be pointed out by the Name, and not through the Primary Sacri fice. If the latter, then, even though this would be directly applicable, yet it would be set aside by the former more authoritative specific Name.
na cātra mandraṃ prātaḥsavanaityādivatsamādhānamasti tasmānna pradhānenāṅgeṣu vasamākhagrā bādhyate /	Nor have we, in this connection, at our disposal the explanation that was given in regard to the sentence Mandram prātahsavanē, etc Vide, ii. For these reasons, it must be admitted that the Names of the subsidiaries are not set aside by the Primary. Because the Name of the subsidiary is due to its uniform relationship to the Performer,and as such, is not caught hold of by the Primary.
na hi pradhānānyādhvarthyavādisamākhayābhiryujyante tṛtīyādhyāyasya saptamaḥ pāda /	Nor is it possible for the subsidiaries to bear, through the Primary, the names of Adh varyava,etc. Nor again is it possible for the Primaries to be related to such names as Adhvaryava and the like because the operation of such names rests in the accessory detail of the Performer.
yā ca pradhāneṣu na vyāpṛtā sā sahāreṇāṅgeṣvavataroṣyatīti kuta etat / ṛgvedādisamākhā pradhāneṣvaṅgeṣu cāviruḍā /	And that Name which is not operative in connection with the Primaries how could that Name apply to the subsidiaries through those Primaries? As for such names as Rgveda and the like, these are compatible, with regard to the Primaries as well as to the Subsidiaries because these names are based upon the fact of those Actions being done by means of these Rgveda,etc. and this fact being capable of being enjoined by the assumed sentence laying down the performance of the Action as a whole, it is quite possible for these Names to apply to the Subsi diaries also as these are also included in that sentence.
sa ca pradhānaprayogavacanena vidheyatvādaṅgeṣu yujyate pāṭhakṛtā cādhvaryyavādisamākhā sā yathāpāṭhameva bhavitumarhati /	As for the names Ādhvaryava and the like, however, these are based upon the fact of the sentences mentioning these Actions being found in those sections of the Veda and as such they would apply precisely in accord ance with the actual mention of the Actions and as such they could not apply to the Primaries and the Subsidiaries alike.
tadātmanā ca śakyamavyaktaḥ śeṣaiti vaktuṃ nāvaśyaṃ pradhānādevāvatarantī samākhagrā 'nugṛhyate sākṣādanugrahe 'pyananugrahe 'pi vā 'nyāṅgeṣu kṛtārthatvenāvirodhāttana prākṛtāsavyatirikteṣu samākhagrā viniyoktīti siddham /	Then as for the Kantakavilodana, etc., they should be taken as having their originative Injunctions in the same Veda as the Primaries and hence with regard to these, the declaration, Avyaktaḥ Çëshē, becomes quite justifiable. the Subsidiaries because as these names would have their require ments fulfilled all the same, there would be nothing incompatible in their being accepted, or not accepted, directly, with regard to the subsidia ries themselves without the intervening agency of the Primary.
tṛtīyādhyāyasya saptamaḥ pāda /tantravārtike /	Sūtra The Purchase of the Priests Services as to be done by the Master as the sacrifice is performed for his sake.

It might be argued that he would acquire that character by having re course to certain ordinary worldly methods.
siī tvetasminnanyo vā syātparikrayāmnānādityetaddṛṣṭavyam /	Sūtra It could be done by others, only in cases where we would have a direct declaration to that effect.
tathā svāminā laukika upāya āstheyo yathā dhvadayaḥ svadravyeṇetarānparikrauṇate samākhānugrahārthamiti prāpte 'bhidhoyate /	But if the Priest does this work, on account of his services having been purchased by the Master, by a method laid down in the scriptures, then in this case also, we have the Master himself as the performer indirect of the action of the giving of gits if however the Priest refuses to do it, for the payment he has received for doing the other actions, then it becomes necessary for the Master to have recourse to the ordinary worldly methods for securing his necessary cooperation. Sūtra They belong to the Master as their principal effect consists of the enabling of the Master to ex perience the Result just as the Principal Action of giving away belongs to the Master.
vaidike dakṣiṇādāne sati kiṃ laukikāśrayaḥ	It is only when the Performer is looked for as a secondary factor that the Name is accepted as indicating which action should be done by which Person.
ṛtviguddeśena hote vidhīyamānāḥ pratipradhānāvṛttinyāyātsarveṣāṃ bhavanto na śakyā samākhyayā bādhitum /	As for the Master however, we find that he has been indubitably recognised as the Principal Performer of the Sacrifice. Nor are the Rites in question meant to create in him the character of the Performer this character is found to be possible even without these.
tasmādiha na vyavasthā sthāditi tathā kāmo 'rthasaṃyogāt	Then what is not duly accomplished, without the due perform.

But as for the Result accruing to the Master, we find that this is not duly accomplished, unless the Rites are duly performed. For this reason it must be ad mitted that these should be performed by the Master just as the Principal Actions, being calculated to lead to certain results desired by Man, are performed by the Master and not by the Priests who perform only those Actions that are calculated to help in the performance of the Sacrifice. Then, inasmuch as these Rites belong to the Master, exactly in the same form in which they are done in ordinary life,it cannot be held that the Adhvaryu is to get hold of the toothbrush, and clean the teeth of the Master And as for the shaving of the Head and Beard, these are always done by the Barber and the Master is spoken of as its Performer simply because it is he who directs the Barber to do it and hence in this case also, there is no chance of the Razor being held by the Adhvaryu.
vyapadeśāditareṣāṃ syāt	Sūtra Also because of the mention being in that form.
anyatra vacanāditareṣāṃ syādiha tādṛśasya vacanasyābhāvādyapadeśādityucyate /	Sūtra Inasmuch as they are Accessory Details, secondary factors their performance could not be regulated by the Name of the Vedic section in which they happen to be mentioned. But as this reply has already been given in Sūtra , the Bhashya proceeds to give another explanation.
vāśabdopādanādyajamānavyatirekeṇa cātmagrahaṇāccaturthyā ca vispaṣṭatādarghyaprasauterātmane vā yajamānāya veti kartṛdayasya phalasaṃbandha iti śakyaṃ vijñātum /	There are certain de tails which, though having the character of Purificatory Rites, are distinctly laid down as pertaining to the Priests,e.g., the Red Tur ban for the Priests at the Cyēna the golden necklaces for the Priests at the Vajapēya and with regard to these there arises the question as to whether these belong to the particular Priest indicated by the Names of the Vedic sections in which they happen to be mentioned or to all of them. The amenability of such accessories as those in question being set aside by the fact of their being distinctly purificatory in their nature, the Declaration, by which they would be transferred from the Master to the Priests, would also connect them with all of them.
mantrāścākamakaraṇāstadvat	Sūtra The Mantras also, that are not instrumental in the performance of any actions, are like the Desire.
akamasaṃyuktā āśīmantrā samākhyayā niya gyante na hi tebhyaḥ phalaniṣpattimantrāṇāmavidhāyakatvādanyasya ca phalakalpanāhetorasaṃbhavāt /	These Benedictory Mantras, not being connected with any action, must be regarded as to be recited by the Person indicated by the Name of the Vedic section in which they occur. Because there are no results to follow from them because the Mantras are not injunctive, and there can be no reason for the assumption of results following from what is not enjoined.
yattvāśāsanaṃ tadyajamānavadadhvaryyoratyutsāha karatvenā viśiṣṭa miti prāple yājamānā ityacyate /	They must be regarded as to be recited by the Master.
te hi phalāntarābhāvāvyadhānaphalaprāptimāśāsate /	Because, having no distinct results of their own, they could not but be express ing the Hope for the Results to follow from the Principal Sacrifice.
yajamānena ca tadāśāsanauyaṃ naṭivajā tadīyasya dakṣiṇālā bhasyānyathā 'pi mihatvādyajamānācca labhyamānatvenāgneraprārthanauyatvāt /	And there can be no doubt that this latter Result is to be hoped for by the Master, and not by the Priest as the Result accruing to the latter, viz., the obtaining of the Sacrificial Fee,would be accom plished even without the due fulfilment of the Principal Result and because this Result the Fee being obtainable from the Master, could not be asked for from Agni.
tasmādyajamānenaiva pradhānaphalaprāptirūpeṇāmotsāhanārthe prayoktavyā iti /	Hence it must be admitted that it is the Master himself who is to recite this Mantra.for the purpose of encouraging himself, by the delineation of the desirable Results to be obtained from the Principal Sacrifice.
viprayoge ca darśanāt	Sūtra Specially as we find the Mantras recited during his absence from the place of Sacrifice.
āśīmanvaṃ ca pravasadyajamānāgnihotreṣvagnyupa tanvavārtika /	We find that these mantras appear along with certain other Mantras, such as Iha ēva san tatra santam, etc.which are to be recited by the Master, by way of a worshipful address to Agni and the words of the latter Mantra distinctly show that it is to be recited by one who is absent from the place where the Agnihotra is actually performed.
sthānārthaṃ proṣitasya darśayati na cartvijaḥ proṣitasya ṛtvikva saṃbhavati kama saṃyogābhāvādyajamānasya tu dravyatyāgenopapadyate /	And this shows that the Recitation belongs to the Master, and not to the Priest because a Priest that would be absent from the place of Sacrifice, would no longer be a Priest as he would not be connected with the Sacrifice. As for the Master, even during his absence, the materials offered in Sacrifice must be those that belonged to him and which he had set aside mentally given away for the Sacrifice and as such he would continue to be related to the Sacrifice, as its Master even during his absence.
tasmāttatmāmānyāditareṣu tathātvam /	And inasmuch as the other Benedictory Mantras Ayurdā,etc. are similar in character to the Mantra Iha ēva san etc., just treated of, they too must be regarded as to be recited by the Master, and not by the Priests.
hyāmnāteṣūbhau dyāmnānasyārtha vattvāt	Sūtra Mantras mentioned twice are to be recited by both as thus alone could the repetition be justified. In connection with the DarçaPürṇamāsa we find certain Mantras mentioned in two parts of the Vedac.g.
jyagrahaṇādimanveṣu sāmānyenādhvaryyave punarviśeṣeṇa yājamāne kāṇḍe paṭhyamāneṣu kimubhau prayokkāro vikalpena samuccayena vā athānyatara iti /	that with which the Butter is taken up. Pancānāntvāvātānam,etc. is found mentioned in a general way in the Adhvaryava section, and again more specifically in the Yaja māna section. And with regard to this there arises the question as to whether this Mantra is to be recited by both conjointly, or by one or the other, optionally.
tatrādhvaryyavatve vikalpe vā prāpte dāvityāha /	or by the Adhvaryu alone, or by the Master alone.
rūpamātraprajñāpanasyāntareṇā'pi karmakālaprayogamadhyayanamātreṇaiva sidatvādājyagrahaṇādi cāsaṃdigdha mādhvaryyavam / tasmānna yajamānena prayoktavyā iti /	And on this questionthe Pūrvapaksha is that It should be recited either by the Adhearyu only, or by the one or the other, optionally.” In reply to this we have the Siddhanta, that both the Adhwaryu as well as the Master should recite it. Objection Inasmuch as the Mantra is more specifically men tioned in the section named Yajamāna, it should be recited by the Master only. Reply A specific Name is accepted to be more authoritative, only when the Mantra is mentioned but once.
uccate /	When however it is mentioned.
yājamāne 'pi rūpamābādevāntareṇāpi kāryyaṃ prayojyatvenāvadhāraṇādastyeva karttapekṣeti yajamānakarṭa tvasiddhiḥ /	separately, in the generic and as well as the specific section,if we were to accept the indications of the Specific Name, then the mention of the Mantra in the other section would be absolutely purposeless. Further, when the specific and the generic pertain to the same object, the former sets aside the latter. And in the case in question though both treat of the same Mantra, yet as its mention is distinct in the two cases, the two must be regarded as pertaining to diverse objects.
kiṃ punasteṣāṃ prayujyamānānāṃ prayojyatvam /	Then again, we must find some use for the two distinct men tions of the Mantra and there can be no other use save that it should be recited by both persons.
ucyate /	Consequently it must be admitted that both the Master and the Adhvaryu should recite the Mantra.
yathaivādhvaryuṃṇā padārthāḥ karttavyāstathaiva yajamānenāpramādārthe pratyavecitavyāttāva mantrā nāmrāyante tatropāyāntareṇa pratyavekṣyate iha tu mantrairityarthavattā /	purpose of showing the form of the Mantra, and the other that of pointing out the use to which it should be put. And then, inas much as Mantras are meant to serve the purpose of indicating the actious to be performed,and as the primary action and its subsi diaries have all one and the same performer, the Mantra should be recited by that Priest who gives his name to the Vedic Section in which the action of holding the butter which is indicated by the Mantra may be found to be laid down. Because it is only in such cases that the Mantra, being coguised as to be used, comes to stand in need of a Person who should use it. And as for the mere pointing out of the form of the Mantra, that could be done, even without its being used at the time of the performance of an Action, by a mere reading of the Vedic text.
yatva yajamānaṃ vācayatīti śrūyate tatvāviddānapi khaṇḍaśa śakyo vācayitumityaniyamaḥ atha vā vihānsvayameva brūyāt / tatra prayojakavyāpāravaiyarghyaṃ bha vettammādavidvāneva vācayitavya iti prāpte 'bhidhīyate na hyanviānvihito 'stauti /	Reply The mention of the Mantra in the Yājamāna section also even though it be meant merely as showing the form of the Mantra, and not as connected with any action, leads us to believe that it is to be used and as such even in this case, it stands in need of a person who could use it and the fact of its being mentioned in the Yājamāna section shows that it is to be used by the Yajamāna Master, Question What special purpose would be served by such use of the Mantras? Answer It is necessary for the Master to examine keep an eye on the actions, just in the same manner as it is necessary for the Adhvaryu to perform them. And in cases where no Mantras are laid down for the Master, the examining would be done in other ways in the case in question however, we find the Mantras distinctly laid down for the Sacrifice and hence the examining would be done by means of these Mantras.
yadi kāmaśrutiparigṛhītaṃ vedādhyayanaṃ bhavettataḥ prayogakāle 'pyadhyāpyeta tattvādhānavadanāramya vidhīyate tasmātyādhyāyo 'dhyetavya iti /	That is to say, if the study of the Veda had been laid down along with the declarations of certain actions as to be performed with a view to certain desirable results,then, it would be possible for the Igno rant Master to be taught the Vedic texts, even at the time of the per formance. Veda being taught at the time of the performance.
tathā sati cārthāpatyabhāvātsidamevedaṃ sarvakarmāṇyagnivad gṛhṇanti na śikṣaṇaṃ prayuñjate na ca śikṣito vedo bhavati tasmātmākarmaṇo ye mantrāḥ paṭhitāsteṅgatvaṃ pratipadyantaiti nāviduṣo 'dhikāro ' / śakyate ca tatrāpi praiṣavatprayojakavyāpārasyārthavattā satyāmapi śaktāvaprayuktī na brūyāditi/	Nor would the texts, taught at the spur of the moment, be called Veda as the proper study of the Veda has to be made under certain very rigid conditions. Consequently, only those Mantrus that have been got up before the performance of the Action commenced, could be accepted as accessories to that Action and hence no Ignorant person can be entitled to the repetition of Mantras at sacrifices. Even in the case of the Master knowing the Mantras, we could have a person urging him to repeat the Mantras just as we have the Priests addressing the several Directions to one another though every one of them knows quite well what is required to be done because even though the Master might be quite capable of reciting the Mantra, yet he cannot do it until urged to it by the Adhearyu.
tacca prayojakatvaṃ devā bhavati yadi vā khaṇḍaśaḥ samarpyate 'tha vā brūhotyabhidhīyate iti /	And as for this urging or prompting, this can be done in two ways the prompter could go on repeating the Mantra part by part and the Master would be repeating it after him, or he would simply ask him to recite and the Master, knowing full well which Mantra was meant to be recited, would go on with the recitation.
yatheṣṭaṃ karmma kiyatā punaviṃditeneti vaiśeṣikādayaḥ svatantravārtike / śākhaṇāpyanadhigatenānadhikāraṃ vadantīti spaṣṭanirūpaṇārthaṃ pṛcchati /	The Bhashya puts forward the question Knowledye of how much of the Veda is necessary for a person being entitled to the repetition of the Mantras? This question is calculated to clear the question raised by the upholders of the Vaçieshika and other systems of philosophy as to a knowledge of their own philosophical systems being necessary for a person before he is entitled to the performance of sacrifices. The reply to this question, given in the Bhashya is Knowledge of that much of the Veda is necessary, as would render him capable of performing the duties devolving upon him,this reply being based upon the fact of the knowledge affording a perceptible help to the Sacrifice through creating in the Performer a certain capability tend.
yadyapi svādhyāyagrahaṇena sakalo vedaḥ parigṛhītastathā 'pi darśapūrṇamāsau kurvāṇasya jyautiṣṭomikamantrabrāhmaṇaṃ na ka cidupayujyataiti asadapi nādhikāraṃ vyāvarttayati iṣṭivedenaiva yogyatāyāḥ siddhatvāttena tadyājinastāvānena svādhyāyaḥ /	That is to say, though the whole of the Veda is included in the svādhyāya Vedie study laid down by the Injunction svadhyayo dhyētavyah, yet inas much as the Mantra and Brāhmaṇa portions dealing with the Jyotish toma could be of no use to ono performing the DarçaPurnamāsa, the absence of a knowledge of those portions could not incapacitate the person from performing these latter Sacrifices. Similarly inasmuch as a knowledge of the Ishti portion of the Veda would make a man cap able of performing the Ishlis, only that portion of the Veda would constitute the svadhyāya for one who would be performing them But the whole of the Veda is studied, because it is not known which actions, the nitya, the naimittka and the kāmya, are performed as occasion presents itself there being no fixed time for these.
kāma śrutyaparigrahāca sarvairanārabhyavādavidhyadhauto vedo 'pekṣita ityavaśyaṃ brahmacaryyakālaeva samasto vedo 'dhyetavyo yadi tu kaścidaṃśakto nādhaute sakalamagnihovadarśapūrṇamāsamātraṃ kathaṃ cidadhigacchati na tasya tatvānadhikāraḥ /	when he would be called upon to perform Sacrifices with a view to certain results,the Vedic portions relating to which he may not have read and not knowing these he would be incapable of performing these Sacrifices and as such, would be excluded from its performance. Then again, the reading up of these portions at the time of the per formance would not be counted as Vedic study as this has a fixed time for it, like all observances nor would such a reading be accopted at Sacrifices, which have all their requirements fulfilled by the Veda studied in the right style as done during a period of Brahmacarya, etc., etc and hence the employment of such a person would create a discrepancy in the performance.
yattvātmajñānaṃ tena vinā pravṛttireva nāstyataḥ sarvakarmārthamaṅgokarttavyam /	Then again, inasmuch as Vedic study is not included in the texts laying down the performance of actions with a view to certain desirable results, all sacrifices stand in need of the Veda as studied in accordance with the generic Sūtra Being mentioned in the Yajamäna section of the Veda, the Actions should be done by the Master.
tu yājamāne samākhyānātkammaṇi yājamānaṃ syuḥ	The other Mantra should be recited by another Priest, who may have special reasons for doing it.

anutpannānāṃ indatvāpādanāśaktervighāyakaśabdābhāvācca naiṣāṃ yājamānaevotpattiḥ kiṃ tahyadhvaryyave /	And there arises the question, which one of the two Mantras should be admitted and which rejected.

When both cannot be used, and one has to be rejected, it is the KaranaMantra Parimirasietc. that should be admitted, because of the particular inherent relationship.

Nor does the mere remoteness of the aid imparted make the accessory imparting such aid the less authoritative, when this accessory appears in another action as this also falls in with the action. In fact, the Mantra sought to be rejected is not a remote Auxiliary either as it serves the purpose of bringing about a visible purificatory effect, by the contrivance of the remembrance of the Tying being performed.

It has been argued above that, the Hotri, without renouncing his characteristic details, becomes connected with the Mantra belong ing to the Adhvaryu.” But he could have been thus conuected, only if the Hotri character depended wholly upon the recitation of that Mantra, or if the Adhvaryu had been laid down with reference to the Mantra related to the Holri, or if the duties of the Adhvaryu had been laid down with reference to the Hotri.
bahiraṅgo dhārādupakārakarūpatvātkriyamāṇānuvādī karaṇastvantaraṅga iti /	Because, the character of the Holyi is as certainable from the presence of a certain capability, and even if that character were determined by any action, there would be thousands of such actions done by him that would serve to mark out the Holri priest.

And under the circumstances, the duties of the Adhvaryu would come to be merely purificatory of one not related to the Original Sacrifice and as this would be far from desirable, it is the contrary view that the Hotri is laid down as reciting the Adhvaryus Mantra that has been accepted. And hence it must be admitted that it is the relationship to the Holri of the Mantra belonging to the Adhvaryu that is directly perceptible and hence being the principal factor, this would be the Mantra recited by the Hotri who is not to recite his own Mantra.

That is to say, in accordance with the Law Mantrantena Karmā disannipātah, the KaranaMantra is always recited before the Tying, while the other Mantra descriptive of the Kriyamana action is recited after the Tying has been done.
katham /	Reply It is not so because the Kriyamāṇacharacter i.e.

Reply Not so because the KaranaMantra, Parivīrasietc. can not indicate all the following the Sankalpa, the getting hold of the Rope, the Sacrificial Post which has not yet been brought in, and the Tying which is but partially coming to appear and as such this Mantra could not but be recited by the Priest standing near the Post, when the Principal Action has been begun and not before that. would continue for a certain length of time, the two Mantras could be recited at different periods of it, and thus too there would be no incongruity in the reciting of both.

Nor is there any authority for regarding the Mantra descriptive of the Kryumāṇa as to be recited at any one period of time during the performance of the Action. Because we find that the Recitation of that Mantra is called up by the Direction addressed to the Hotri immediately after the Holding of the Rope and being a long Mantra it takes up all the time from then till the end of the Action of Tying and if the Advaryus Mantrai.e. the KaraṇaMantrawere to come in during this time it could not be admitted without interfering with the recitation of the former Mantra. Objection Under the circumstances, it being found necessary to reject cither the simultaneity of the two Mantras, or the fact of their being recited by the same person,it would be more reasonable to reject the time i.e. the simultaneity, as its cognition appears long after that of the subject under consideration and there would be no ground for rejecting their intimate relationship to the same person Reciter.

What the Mantra does is to mention a result that always follows from the subsidiary action done with the Mantra. Because the Mantra has been laid down as serving a wholly distinct. purpose that of pointing to the Deity and as such it is only when it indicates either the action, or something else connected with it, that it comes to be regarded as an accessory of the Principal Action. Thus then, in the case in question, if the Mantra only spoke of the glory attaching to the Adhraryu Priest,then, in that case, the whole of this Mantra could not be used in accomplishment of the Anrädhäna of Fire in connection with which it is laid down because an indica.

Now there arises the question as to whether the Clarified Butter is to be replaced by Simple Butter, only at those Subsidiaries that are performed at the time of the Sutyā, or at all the Subsidiaries of the Cyena.
