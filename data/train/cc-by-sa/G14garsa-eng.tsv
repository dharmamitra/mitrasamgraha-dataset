Lord Kṛṣṇa must have thought, Why should I curse My friend in this way, so for no reason he will become a greedy miser.
 64 and 65 yādṛśī me kṛtā prītis tādṛśīm prāpayiṣyatipitarāṭ asya kaṃsena kārāgare kṛtau purākṛṣṇas tu nanda sadane para gehe ca vardhitaḥ sa dāsyati katham dravyaṃ dhana yukto 'pi nirdhanaḥ 	 He will give me what makes me love Him more. He did that to His parents when they were locked in Kaṃsa's prison and when He grew up in the home of His stepfather Nanda.

ratnaiḥ prapūritān gehān dṛṣṭvā vāñchām na kārayetlalāṭe likhitam yad yan na tan nyūnam bhaviṣyati	 Even if one sees a palace filled with jewels, he should not desire to have it. A person's destiny is written on his forehead. That destiny cannot be changed.

bubhuje 'lampaṭo vipraḥ samṛddhim svām ahaitukīmmanasā jāyayā tyakṣañ jñāna vairāgya bhaktitaḥ 	 Without becoming materialistic, the brāhmaṇa enjoyed the wealth he received by the Lord's causeless mercy. Filled with knowledge, renunciation, and devotion for the Lord, in their hearts he and his wife abandoned all material desires.
cakāra tarkanām vipraḥ kuto mama samṛddhayaḥ dattā brahmaṇya devena devānām api durlabhāḥ 	 The brāhmaṇa thought: Who gave me these opulences? It must be that Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is the master of the brāhmaṇas, gave me these opulences even the great demigods cannot achieve.
idṛśīm sampadam dattvā nācaret kim api svayammama taṇòula muṣṭim ca prītyā pratyagrahīd dhariḥ 	 I did not do anything to make Lord Kṛṣṇa give me opulence like this. It must be that He was pleased by the palmful of rice and out of love He gave me this in return.
tasya sakhyam ca dāsyam ca bhūyān me janma janmanitat padāmburuha dhyānāt tariṣye 'ham bhavārṇavam	 I pray that I may be His servant and friend birth after birth. By meditating on His lotus feet, I will cross the ocean of birth and death.

 duryodhana uvāca muni śārdūla bhagavān balabhadro nāga kanyābhir gopībhiḥ kadā kālindī kūle vijahāra.	 Duryodhana said: O tiger of sages, when did Lord Balarāma enjoy the rāsa dance on the Yamunā's shore with gopīs that had been snake girls in their previous birth?
 śrī prāòvipāka uvāca ekadā dvārakā nāgarād dhi tālāìkaṃ ratham āsthāpya surān didṛkṣuḥ param utkaṇṭho nanda rāja gokula go gopāla gopī gaṇa saìkulaḥ saìkarṣaṇa āgataś cirotkaṇṭhābhyāṃ nandarāja yaśodābhyāṃ pariṣvakto gopī gopāla gobhir militvā tatra dvau masau vasantikau cāvatsīt.	 Śrī Prāòvipāka Muni said: One day, eager to see His devotees, Lord Balarāma mounted His chariot bearing a palm tree flag, left Dvārakā, and, yearning to see the gopas, gopīs, and cows, went to Gokula. Yaśoda' and King Nanda embraced Him when He arrived. Later He met with the gopas and gopīs. He stayed there for two months.
 atha ca yā nāga kanyāḥ pūrvoktās tā gopa kanyā bhūtvā balabhadra prāpty artham gargācāryād balabhadrapañcāìgam gṛhītvā tenaiva siddhā babhūvuḥ . tābhir baladeva ekadā prasannaḥ kālindī kūle rāsa maṇòalam samārebhe. tadaiva caitra pūrṇimāyām pūrṇa candro 'ruṇa varṇaḥ sampūrṇam vanam rañjayan vireje.	 The previously described snake girls became gopīs and, in order to attain Lord Balarāma's association, on Garga Muni's advice followed the five methods of worshiping Lord Balarāma. In this way they became perfect. Pleased with them, Lord Balarāma enjoyed a rāsa dance with them on the full moon night of the month of Caitra (March April), a night when the red moon reddened the whole of Vṛndāvana forest.

Cooling, gentle, delightful, lotus pollen filled breezes pushed the Yamunā's waves and blew to the splendid shore. Then the land of Vraja became very splendid, its many forest groves and courtyards filled with the fragrant pollen of playfully and gracefully blossoming flowers, with the cooing of cuckoos and peacocks, and with the sweet humming of bees.

Decorated with tinkling ankle bells, glittering gold and jewel necklace, armlets, belt, crown, and earrings, and with many lotus petals, dressed in blue garments, and His eyes like glittering lotus petals, Lord Balarāma was splendid with the gopīs in the rāsa dance circle. He was like Kuvera surrounded by a host of beautiful yakṣīs.

Then, sent by the demigod Varuṇa, Goddess Varuṇī, in the form of honey oozing from the hollows of trees filled with the humming of bees made greedy by the sweet scent of the flowers, made the entire forest very fragrant. Eager to drink that honey, His eyes now red lotus flowers, His limbs weakened by enjoying amorous pastimes, perspiration born from the fatigue of His pastimes now streaming down His cheeks and washing away the pictures and designs drawn there, walking like an elephant king, decorated with mighty arms like the trunks of elephant kings, as if intoxicated, sitting on a throne, relinquishing His plow, His club still in His hand, splendid like ten million full moons, His jewel anklets, bracelets, and other ornaments tinkling, His gold earrings, necklaces, finger rings, and jewel crown glittering, and surrounded by beautiful gopīs, their cheeks decorated with graceful pictures and designs and their black braids mocking the beautiful snake girls, Lord Balarāma, the Supreme Personality of Godhea the master of the worlds, shone with great splendor, and enjoyed transcendental pastimes.
 atha ha vāva kālindī kūla kāntāra paryaṭana vihāra pariśramodyat sveda bindu vyāpta mukhāravindaḥ snānārthaṃ jala krīòārthaṃ yamunāṃ dūrāt sa ājuhāva. tatas tṭ anāgataṃ taṭinīṃ halāgreṇa kupito vicakarṣa iti hovāca ca.	 His lotus face covered with perspiration born from the fatigue of wandering along the Yamunā's shore and enjoying many pastimes, Lord Balarāma called for the Yamuna' to come to Him so He could bathe and enjoy water pastimes. When the Yamuna' did not come, Lord Balarāma became angry and began to drag it to Him, scratching its shore with the tip of His plow. Lord Balarāma said:
 adya mām avajñāya nayasi mayāhūtāpi musalena tvaṃ kāma cāriṇīṃ śatadhā neṣya eva nirbhartsitā sa bhūri bhītā yamunā cakitā tat pādayoḥ patitovāca.	 Today you have no respect for Me. Even though I call, you ignore My order and go your own way as you wish. Now I will divide you into a hundred tiny streams. Rebuked with these words and now very afraid, the Yamuna' came before Lord Balarāma, fell at His feet, and said:
 rāma rāma saìkarṣaṇa balabhadra mahā bāho tava paraṃ vikramaṃ na jāne. yasyaikasmin mūrdhni sarṣapavat sarvaṃ bhū khaṇòa maṇòalam dṛśyate. tasya tava param anubhāvam ajānantīṃ prapannāṃ māṃ moktuṃ yogyo 'si. tvaṃ bhakta vatsalo 'si.	 Rāma! Rāma! Saìkarṣaṇa! Balabhadra! O mighty armed one! I did not know Your great power. The entire earth is seen resting like a single tiny mustard seed on one of Your many heads. It is proper for You to release Me, who have now surrendered to You and who did not know Your true glories. You should release me because You are always affectionate to Your devotees.

Begged in this way, Lord Balarāma released the Yamunā. Then He enjoyed in the Yamunā's waters, as an elephant enjoys with its many wives. When He returned to the shore the Yamuna' approached and gave Him gifts of many blue garments and many ornaments of gold and jewels. Lord Balarāma divided the gifts among the girls, giving some to each gopī. Then He dressed in one of the blue garments and decorated Himself with a necklace of gold and nine kinds of jewels. Then He enjoyed with the gopīs as the king of elephants enjoys with its many wives.

O king of the Kauravas, in this way Lord Balarāma, the king of the Yādavas, spent that springtime night with the gopīs. Even today the Yamuna' flows in many divided streams at that place, a testimony to the great strength, equal to that of a host of elephants, of Lord Balarāma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A person who hears or recounts these pastimes of Lord Balarāma destroys the entirety of a great host of sins and attains transcendental bliss. What more do you wish to hear?

Śrī Prāòvipāka Muni said: O king of the Kauravas, one day Garga Muni left Mount Garga and went to Vraja to bathe in the Yamunā. In a certain forest grove by the Yamunā's shore, where gentle breezes moved the graceful trees, flowering vines, and new sprouts, and where the bees were maddened by the sweet scent of the flowers, some gopīs bowed down before Garga Muni, who was rapt in meditation on Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma. Remembering their previous birth as snake princesses, the gopīs asked him what kind of devotional service they should perform to attain the company of Lord Balarāma. Seeing their great devotion, Garga Muni gave these gopīs the paddhati, paṭala, stotra, kavaca, and sahasra nāma of Lord Balarāma. What more do you wish to hear? You may ask.

O brāhmaṇa, you are affectionate to the devotees. O gurudeva, I bow down before you.
śrī prāòvipāka uvāca rāma mārgasya niyamaṃ śṛṇu pārthiva sattamayena prasanno bhavati balabhadro mahā prabhuḥ 	 Śrī Prāòvipāka Muni said: O best of kings, please hear the regulative principles of the path to Lord Balarāma. When one follows these principles Lord Balarāma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becomes pleased with him.
sahasra vadano devo bhagavān bhuvaneśvaraḥ na dānair na ca tīrthaiś ca bhaktyā labhyas tṭ ananyayā	 Lord Balarāma, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of the worlds, and who is also thousand headed Lord Ananta, is not attained by giving charity or going on pilgrimage. He is attained only by devotional service. 
sat saìgam etyāśu śikṣed bhaktiṃ vai śrī harer guroḥ sa siddhaḥ kathito jātaṃ yasya vai prema lakṣaṇam	 By associating with the devotees, one quickly learns the truth of devotion to Lord Kṛṣṇa and to one's guru. A person who learns this is said to have attained perfection. He has attained love for Lord Kṛṣṇa.
