tajjātīyatvādanāgateṣvavirodho dugdhendhanavat /	In the same way, one calls milk iñ the udder dugdha, “that which has been drawn,” and kindling indhana, or “wood to be burned.” Conditioned things are the paths;

By “foundations of discourse” one should understand “the foundations of discourse, that is, words, together with that which the words signify.”
anyathā hi urakaraṇagrantho virudhyeta /	If we understand “foundations of discourse” to be only words, we would be at variance with the Prakaraṇapāda which says;

hetuvacanaḥ kila vastuśabda iti vaibhāṣicāḥ /	Conditioned things are dependent on causes; they are thus.

upādānāni vā tebhyaḥ saṃbhavantīti upādānaskandhāḥ puṣpaphalavṛkṣavat /	” or rather because they give rise to the defilements, as one says “flower-bearing tree” or “frnit-bearing tree.”

raṇsā hi kleśāḥ / ātmapāravyāvādhanāt / stadanuśayitatvāt saraṇāḥ / sāsravavat /	The defilements are of battle because they injure oneself and others. Impure conditioned things are qualified “of battle,” “in a relationship with battle,” because the defilements of battle adhere to.
punaḥ duḥkhaṃ samudayo loko dṛṣṭisthānaṃ bhavaśca te  //	They are also suffering, arising, the world, the locus of false opinions, existence.

By deteriorating, by being transformed.

na vai paramāṇurūpamekaṃ pṛthag bhūtamasti /	but a monad never exists in an isolated state; in the state of agglomeration, being an agglomerate, it is liable to deterioration and to resistance (Vhāṣā, TD 27, p.

āśrayabhūtarūpaṇādityapare evaṃ tarhi cakṣurvijñānādīnāmapyāśrayarūpaṇāt rūpatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	Avijñapti is rūpa, for the primary elements, which constitute its point of support, are r/pa. According to this principle, the five sense consciousnesses would be 7%pa, for their point of support (the organ of sight, etc. ) is %pa.

avijñaptirhi cchāyeva vṛkṣaṃ prabheva maṇiṃ bhūtānyāśrtya varttate /	Avijñapri exists dependent upon the primary elements, as a shadow exists dependent on a tree, as the brilliance of a jewel exists dependent upon ‘the jewel.

cchāyādivarṇaparamāṇūnāṃ pratyekaṃ svabhūtacatuṣkāśritatvābhyupagamāt /	That the shadow, or the brilliance of a jewel exists dependent upon the tree, or on the jewel, is a hypothesis that does notThe Vaibhāṣikas hold that each one of the atoms of color which constitute shade and brilliance, exists dependent upon a tetrad of primary elements.
satyapi ca tadāśritatve cchāyāprabhayornāvijñaptistathaivāśritā / yujyate /	And even supposing that: “The shadow is dependent upon the tree, since the shadow is dependent on the primary elements which are proper to it, and these are dependent upon the tree,"—the comparison to the shadow and avñapti is inadmissible.
niruddheṣvapi avijña ptyāśayeṣu mahābhūteṣu tasyā anirodho 'bhyupagamyate /	The Vaibhāṣikas admit that gvrjñapti does not perish when the primary elements which serve as its point of support perish.
ato na bhavatyeṣa parihāraḥ /	Consequently your refutation is worthless. But, we would say, one can refute the objection: “According to this principle, the five sense consciousnesses would be rūpa.”
anye punaratra parihāramāhuḥ cakṣurvijñānādīnāmāśrayo bhedaṃ gataḥ /	In fact, the support of visual consciousness is twofold: 1. the organ of sight, which is in a state of “impact” , which is rūpa; and 2.
kaṣcidrūpyate cakṣurādiḥ kaścinna rūpyate yathā manaḥ /	the mental organ which is not rūpa.
na tvevamavijñaptiḥ / tasmādasamānaḥ prasaṅgaḥ ityata upapannametadāśraya rūpaṇādrūpamiti /	Now the same does not hold for gvjñapti whose point of supportThus, from the fact that avjñapti is called rūpa because its point of support is rpa, one cannot conclude that visual consciousness should be called rāpa. Therefore, the second explanation is the right one.

The samskaras are everything that is conditioned; but the name is reserved for those conditioned things which are not included in either the skandhas of rupa, vedana, or samjña, explained above, or in the skandha of vijnana explained below.
bhagavatā tu sūtre ṣaṭ cetanākāyā ityuktaṃ prādhānyāt / sā hi karmasvarūpatvādabhisaṃskaraṇe pradhānā /	It is true that the Blessed One said in a Sutra, “The samskaraskandha is the six classes of volition; ” but this definition excludes from samskaraskandha all the viprayuktasamskaras, and the sanprayuktasamskaras, with the exception of volition.
ata evoktaṃ bhagavatā “saṃskṛtamabhisaṃskaroti / tasmāt saṃskārā upādānaskandha ity ucyata” iti	Also the Blessed One said, "The upadana skandha called sankhara is so called because it conditions conditioned things," that is to say, because it creates and determines the five skandhas of future existence.

They would thus not form part of the 'Truths of Suffering and Arising: one would not either know them, nor abandon them.
uktaṃ ca bhagavatā “nāhamekadharmamapi anabhijñāyāparijñāya duḥkhasyāntakriyāṃ vadāmīti / evamaprahāye” tyuktam /	Now the Blessed One said, "If there is a single dharma which is not known and penetrated, I declare that one cannot put an end to suffering.

But the semṁgraha is occasional and as a consequence, not real, but conventional.

atha nāpekṣate / sa āha / paramāṇureko dhāturekamāyatanamekaḥ skandha” iti /	when they do not take this fact into consideration, they say that an atom is a dhātu, an āyatana, skandha. In fact, one metaphorically designates the part by the whole;
bhavati hi pradeśe “pi pradeśivadupacāro yathā paṭṭaiakadeśe dagdhe paṭo dagdha iti /	for example, "The robe is burned," for "One part of the robe is burned.

saṃkṣiptamadhyavistaragrantharucitvāt /	The teaching of the rkandhas addresses itself to the first category of hearers, to those who are mistaken with respect to mental phenomena, who ere of shatp facalties, and who aere fond of a brief teaching;
teṣāṃ yathākramaṃ tisraḥ skandhāyatanadhātudeśanā iti //	the teaching of the āyaśanas addresses itself to the second category, and the teaching of the dhātus addresses itself to the third category.

vivādamūlasaṃsārahetutvāt kramakāraṇāt / caittebhyo vedanāsaṃjñe pṛthakaskndhau niveśitau //	The two mental states, sensation and ideas, are defined as distinct séandhas because they are the causes of the roots of dispute, because they are the causes of transmigration, and also by reason of the causes which justify the order of skandhas.
dve vivādamūle /	There are two roots of dispute: attachment to pleasure, andSensation and ideas are, respectfully, the principal causes of these two roots.
kāmādhyavasānaṃ dṛṣṭyadhyavasānaṃ ca / tayorvedanāsaṃjñe yathākramaṃ pradhānahetū /	In fact, if one becomes attached to pleasures, it is because one relishes the sensation;

yacca skandhakrame kāraṇamupadekṣyamāṇaṃ tato 'pi kramakāraṇādanayoḥ pṛthakskandhīkaraṇaṃ veditavyam / etacca tredho papādayiṣyāmaḥ /	The reasons which justify the order of the rkandhas will be explained below. Why do unconditioned things, which form part of the dharrnāyataṇa and the dharmadhāku, not form part of the skaṇdhas?
skandheṣva saṃskṛtaṃ noktamarthāyogāt	Unconditioned things are not named with respect to the ṛkandhas, because they do not correspond to the concept.
taddhi skandheṣūcyamānaṃ na tāvadeteṣvevāntarṇetuṃ śakyate	Unconditioned things cannot be placed within any of the five skandhas, for they are not matter, nor sensation.
arthāyogāt / nahi tadrūpaṃ nāpi yāvadvijñānamiti / nacāpi ṣaṣṭhaḥ skandho vaktuṃ śakyate /	One cannot make a sixth skandha of the unconditioned: it does not correspond to the concept of skandha, since skandha signifies “heap,” “capable of being put together.”
kutaḥ / arthāyogāt / “rāśyartho hi skandhārtha” ityuktam /	One cannot say of the.
nacāsaṃskṛtamatītādibhedabhinnaṃ rūpādivadyatastatsarvamaikadhyamabhisaṃkṣipyāsaṃskṛtaskandha iti saṃkhyāṃ gacchet /	unconditioned what the Sūtra says of matter: “If one puts together all this unconditioned, that which is past, one has that which one calls the asa/skṛtaskandha,” for the distinctions of past, etc. , do not exist with respect to unconditioned things. Furthermore, the expression pādānaskaṇdha designates the totality of that which is the cause of defilements;
saṃkleśavastujñāpanārthaṃ khalūpādānaskandhavacanaṃ saṃkleśavyavadānavastujñāpanārthaṃ skandhavacanaṃ /	the expression skandha designates the totality of that which is the cause of defilement as well as the cause of purification (pure conditioned things: the Path).
nacobhayathā “pyasaṃskṛtamityarthāyogānna teśu vyavasthāpitam /	Thus unconditioned things, which are neither the cause of defilement, nor the cause of purification, cannot be placed either among the upādānaskandhas nor among the skandhas.
yathā ghaṭoparamo na ghaṭa evaṃ skandhoparamo na skandho bhavitumarhatītyapare /	According to one opinion, the same way that the end of a jug is not a jug, in this same way unconditioned things, which are the end or cessation of the skandhas, are not skandhas
teṣāṃ dhātvāyataneṣvapyeṣa prasaṅgaḥ /	And so according to this reasoning unconditioned things will be neither āyatanas nor dhātus.
uktaḥ skandhānāmanyaḥ prakāraḥ //	We have defined the séandhas.
kramaḥ punaḥ /	We should now explain the order in which the rkandhas are enumerated.
yathaudārikasaṃkleśabhājanādyarthadhātutaḥ //	The order of the sēandhas is justified by their grossness, their defilement, the characteristic of the jug, etc. , and also from the point of view of their spheres of influence.
rūpaṃ hi sapratighatvātsarvaudārikam /	Matter, being subject to resistance, is the grossest of the skandhas.
arupiṇāṃ vedanā pracāraudārikatayā /	Among the non-material skandhas, sensation is the grossest, by reason of the grossness of its functioning;
tathā hi vyapadiśanti haste me vedanā pāde me vedaneti / dvābhyāṃ cau dārikatarā saṃjñā /	in fact, one localizes sensation in the hand, in the foot, etc. Ideas are grosser than the last two skandhas.
vijñānātsaṃskārā ityato yadaudārikataraṃ tatpūrvamuktam /	The saṁskāraskandha is grosser that the skandha of consciousness. The séandhas are thus arranged in order of their diminishing grossness.
athavā anādimati saṃsāre strīpuruṣā anyonyaṃ rūpābhirāmāste ca vedanāsvādagarddhāt /	In the course of external transmigration, men and women are mutually infatuated by their bodies because they are attached to the pleasures of sensation.
tadgarddhaḥ saṃjñāviparyāsāt /	This attachment proceeds from erroneous ideas, which are due to the defilements which are saskāras.
tadviparyāsaḥ kleśaiścittaṃ aca tatsaṃkliṣṭamiti yathāsaṃkleśaṃ ca kramaḥ / bhājanādyarthena vā /	And it is the mind which is defiled by the.
bhajanabhojanavyañjanakarttṛ bhoktṛbhūtā hi rūpādayaḥ skandhāḥ / dhātuto vā /	Matter is the pot, sensation is the food, ideas are the seasoning, the ramṁskāras are the cook, and the mind is the consumer. We have a third reason for the order of the skandhas.
kāmaguṇarūpaprabhāvito hi kāmadhātuḥ /	Finally, in considering the séanṉdhas on the one hand, and the dhātus or spheres of existence on the other, one sees that Kāmadhātu is characterized by matter, namely by the five objects of sense enjoyment.
vedanāprabhāvitāni dhyānāni / saṃjñāprabhāvitāḥ trayaḥ ārūpyāḥ / saṃskāramātraprabhāvitaṃ bhavāgram /	Rūpadhātu, that is to say the Four Dhyānas, is characterized by sensation (organs of pleasure, satisfaction, and indifference, viii12). The first three stages of Ārāpyadhātu are characterized by ideas: ideas of infinite space, etc. The fourth stage of Ārūpyadhātu, or the summit of existence, is characterized by volition, the saṁiskāra par excellence, which there reates an existence of twenty-four thousand cosmic ages.
etā eva vijñānasthitayaḥ tāsu ca pratiṣṭhitaṃ vijñānamiti kṣetrabijasaṃdarśanārthaḥ skandhānukramaḥ /	Finally, these diverse stages are the “abodes of consciousness” ; it is in these places that the mind resides. The first fourSkandhas constitute the field;
ata eva pañcaskandhā nālpīyāṃso na bhūyāṃsaḥ /	the fifth constitutes the seed. There are thus five rkandhas, no more, no less.
ata eva ca kramakāraṇādvedanāsaṃjñe saṃskārebhyaḥ pṛthaka skandhīkṛte /	One sees how the reasons which justify the order of the skandhas also justify the doctrine that makes sensation and ideas separate skandhas: they are grosser than the other samskaras;
yata ete audārikatare saṃkleśānukramahetū bhājanavyañjanabhūte tatprabhāvitaṃ ca dhātudvayamiti //	they are the cause of the process of defilement; they are the food and the seasoning; and they reign over the two spheres of existence.
āyatanadhātūnāṃ ṣaṇṇāṃ cakṣurādīnāmanukramo vaktavyaḥ / tadvaśenaiva hi tadviṣayavijñānānāṃ kramaḥ / teṣāṃ ca punaḥ ṣaṇṇāṃ /	One should now explain the order in which the six ayatanas or dhatus which are the six organs of consciousness, the organ of sight, etc. , are enumerated: an order the function of which is to arrange the objects and the consciousnesses which correspond to these organs.
prāk pañca vārttamārthyāt	The first five are the first because their object is present.
cakṣurādīni pañca varttamānaviṣayatvāt pūrvamuktāni / manastvaniyataviṣayam	Five, beginning with the organ of sight, are called the first, because they bear only on present, simultaneous objects. Conversely, the object of the mental organ can be either simultaneous to this organ;
kiñcidvarttamānaviṣayaṃ kiñcit vyadhvānadhraviṣayam / bhautikārthyāccatuṣṭayam /	earlier or past;
prāgiti varttate / pañcānāṃ punaśctvāri pūrvamuktāni /	later or future; tritemporal, that is to say.
bhautikaviṣayatvāt / kāyasya tvaniyato viṣayaḥ	The first four are the first because their object is solely derived or secondary matter. The organs of sight, of hearing, of smell and of taste do not attain to the primary elements, but solely to matter which derives from the primary elements.
kadācid bhūtāni kadācid bhautikam kadācidubhayam /	The object of touch is not constant: sometimes primary elements, sometimes derived matter, sometimes both at the same time. These four are arranged according to the range and speed of their activity.
dūrāśutaravṛttyā 'nyat śeṣaṃ punaritasmād yathāyogaṃ dūrāśutaravṛttyā pūrvamuktam /	Their activity is at a distance, at a greater distance, very rapid.
cakṣuḥśrotraṃ hi dūraviṣayam /	The organ of sight and the organ of hearing bear on a distant object.
tat pūrvamuktaṃ dvayāt /	They are thus named first.
tayorapi cakṣuṣo dūratare vṛttiḥ /	The organ of sight bears on objects at a greater distance than does the organ of hearing: for one can see a river of which one cannot make out the sound.
paśyato 'pi dūrānnadīṃ tacchabdāśravaṇādatastat pūrvamuktam /	The organ of sight is thus named before the organ of hearing.
ghrāṇasya tu nāsti dūre vṛttiḥ /	Neither odor nor taste are perceived at a distance. But the activity of smell is more rapid than that of taste.
jihvāyāśca /	The organ of smell perceives.
tayorāśutaravṛttitvāt ghrāṇaṃ pūrvamuktamaprāptasyaiva jihvā bhojyasya gandhagrahaṇāt /	The odor of food before the organ of taste perceives its taste.
yathāsthānaṃ kramo 'thavā // athavā asmin śarīre cakṣuṣo 'dhiṣṭhānamupāriṣṭāt niviṣṭam /	Or rather the organs are arranged according to their position. The point of support or the place of the organ of sight, that is to say, the eye, is the highest;
tasmādadhaḥ śrotrasya /	below that, the place of the organ of hearing;
tasmādadho ghrāṇasya /	below that, the place of the organ of smell;
tasmāt jihvāyāḥ takyāḥ syāsya bahulyena /	below that, the place of the organ of taste. As for the place of the organ of touch, that is to say the body, it is, for the most part, lower than the tongue.
manaḥ punastānyeva niśritamadeśasthaṃ ceti yathāsthānameṣāṃ kramaḥ syāt /	As for the mental organ, it is not matter.
kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ daśasvāyataneṣu rūpaskandhasaṃgṛhīteṣvekaṃ rūpāyatanamucyate /	Among the ten ayatanas included within vapaskandha, only one receives the name of rapa-ayatana.
sarveṣu ca dharmasvabhaveṣvekaṃ dharmāyatanamityāha	And although all the ayatanas are dharmas, only one is called dharma-ayatana. Why? A single ayatana is called rupa-ayatana with a view to distinguishing it from the others, and by reason of its excellence.
viśeṣaṇārthaṃ prādhānyādbahudharmāgrasaṃgrahāt / ekamāyatanaṃ rūpamekaṃ dharmākhyamucyate // kathaṃ viśeṣaṇārtham /	A single ayatana is called dharma-ayatana with a view to distinguishing it from the others, and because it includes many of the dharmas as well as the best dharma.

yadyetat prayojanamadhiṣṭhānamevāstu śobhārthaṃ vacanārthaṃ ca mā bhūdindriyam /	The organs of smell and taste are useful in Rūpadhātu, for, without them, beauty and elocation would be missing. The nose, support of the subtle matter that constitutes the organ of smell, suffices for beauty; the tongue, the place of the oṟgan of taste, suffices for elocation.
nānindriyamadhiṣṭhānaṃ saṃbhavati /	The members:—nose and tongue,—which support the organ, cannot be deprived of this organ.
puruṣendriyādhiṣṭhānavat /	There is no nose or tongue where the subtle matter that constitutes the organ of smell or the organ of taste is missing, in the same way that the sexual member is always endowed with a special organ of touch which is called the sexual organ.
yuktastadasaṃbhavo niṣprayojanatvāt /	One can well conceive that the sexual member is lacking when the sexual organ is lacking, for, stripped of this organ, it serves no function;

syānnāma niḥprayojanā na tu nirhetukā /	The arising of an organ can be without usefulness: but it is never without a cause.
kaśca heturindriyotpatteḥ / indariyasatṛṣṇasya karmaviśeṣaḥ /	What is the cause of the arising of an organ, if not a certain act commanded by a desire relative to this organ?

na tadviṣayavītarāgāṇāṃ ghrāṇajihvendriye saṃbhavitumarhataḥ /	Thus there is no reason for the organs of smell and taste to appear among beings who are reborn in Rūpadhātu, since these beings are detached from odors and tastes.
puruṣendraiyamapi vā kiṃ na nivarttate /	Otherwise, why is the sexual organ lacking in Rūpadhātu?

sūtraṃ tarhi virudhyate / “avikalā ahīnendariyā” iti /	According to the Vaibhāṣikas, toMaintain that the organs of smell and taste are lacking in Rāpadhatū is to contradict the Sūtra. The Sūtra teaches that beings of Rūpadhātu possess, complete, all the organs: they are never one-eyed, or only one-eared.

ātmabhāvamukhena hi ṣaḍāyatane tṛṣṇāsamudācāro na viṣayamukhena /	Thirst enters into action with regard to these six organs of consciousness, not by reason of the object of these six organs, but by reason of the person himself. Thus the arising of the organs of smell and taste has a cause, even if one were detached from odors and tastes.
puruṣendriye tu maithunasparśamukheneti /	But the same does not hold for the sexual organ. Attachment relative to this organ has for its principle attachment to the tactile consciousness of sexual union. Now beings who will be reborn in Rūpadhātu are.

yalloke sacetanamityucyate /	Matter that the Abhidharma calls "appropriated," is called in common language, saceśanā or sensitive matter.

“bhūtamātraṃ daśāyatanānī“ti bhadantbduddhadevaḥ /	According to the Bhadanta Buddhadeva, the ten āyatanas, that is, the five organs of consciousness and their objects, are solely primary matter. An inadmissible opinion.
tacca naivaṃ bhūtānāṃ catuṣṭva khakkhaṭādilakṣaṇāvadhāraṇāt sūtre / teṣāṃ spraṣṭavyatvāt /	The Sutra teaches, in a limited manner, that there are four primary elements, and it defines them in a limited manner as being solidity, fluidity, etc. Now solidity, fluidity, etc. , are tangibles and solely tangibles: solidity is not perceived by the organ of sight.
na hi kāṭhinyādīni cakṣurādibhirgṛhyante nāpi varṇādayaḥ kāyendriyeṇa /	Furthermore, each organ attains to the secondary matter which is appropriate to it: color is not perceived by the organ of touch.
uktaṃ ca sūtre “cakṣurbhikṣo ādhyātmikamāyatanaṃ catvāri mahābhūtānyupādāya rūpaprasādo arupyanidarśanaṃ saprataighaṃ evaṃ yāvat kāyaḥ	Further, that the tangible is primary matter and secondary matter, and that the nine other materials āyatanas are solely secondary matter, results from the same words of the Sūtra: “Oh Bhikṣus, the eye, the internal source of consciousness, a subtle matter derived from the primary elements, material sources, invisible, capable of being.
rūpāṇi bhikṣo bāhyamāyatanaṃ catvāri mahābhūtānyupādāyarupi sanidarśanaṃ sapratigham / śabdo bhikṣo bāhyamāyatanaṃ catvāri mahābhūtānyupādāya rupyanidarśanaṃ sapratigham /	The visible matter is an external sources of consciousness, deriving from the primary elements, material, visible, capable of being struck.

spraṣṭavyāni bhikṣo bāhyamāyatanaṃ catvāri mahābhūtāni catvāri mahābhūtānyupādāya rūpyanidarśanaṃ sapratighami“ti /	But, with respect to the tangible: “Tangibles are an external source of consciousness, the four primary elements and matter deriving from the four primary elements.”
spraṣṭrvyāyatanikadeśenaiva bhūtānāṃ saṃgrahāccheṣaṃ na bhūtānīti spaṣṭamādarśitam /	One can maintain that the five organs are primary matter, for the Sūtra says: “Eveṟything that is in the eye, a ball of flesh, is solid, resistant.”
yattarhi sūtre uktaṃ “yaccakṣuṣi maṃsapiṇḍe khakkhaṭaṃ kharagatami“ti tenāvinirbhadivarttino maṃsapiṇḍsyaiṣa upadeśaḥ /	Here the Sūtra refers to the ball of flesh which is not separable from the organ of sight, and not to the organ itself. But, according to the Gerbhāvakrāntisūra “a petson is the six ḍhātus,” the primary element of earth, the primary element of water, the primary element of fire, the primary element of wind, the space element and the v#ñāna element. Thus, in theThe body in embryonic state is made up of primary matter, not secondary matter.
ṣaḍdhāturayaṃ bhikṣo puruṣa“iti garbhavakrāntau maulasattvadravyasaṃdarśanārtham /	For in this first phrase, "a person is the six dhatus," the Sutra means to describe the essence of a person, and it does not pretend to give an exhaustive definition.
punaḥ ṣaṭsparśyatanavacanāccaittābhāvaprasaṅgācca /	In fact, the Sutra then says that a person is the six points of support of the mental dharma called contact, that is to say, the six organs.
na ca yuktaṃ cittameva caittā ityabhyupetum /	Further, to take this definition literally, "a person is the six dhatus," one would infer the non-existence of the mental states, for the mental states are not included within vijnanadhatu, which is the mind. Would one maintain that the mental states are the mind, and as a consequence are included within vijnanadhatu?
“saṃjñā ca vedanā ca caitasika eṣa dharmaścittānvayāccittaniśrita';	One cannot, for the Sutra says "Sensation and ideas are dharmas which are mental states, dharmas associated with the mind, having the mind for their point of support;
iti sūtre vacanātsarāgacittādi vacanācca /	" and the Sutra speaks of a "mind possessing desire;
tasmācyathoktaṃ dhātūnaṃ bhūtabhautikatvam /	" thus desire, which is a mental state, is not the mind. It is thus proven that our definition is correct.
kati saṃcitāḥ katyasaṃcitāḥ / saṃcitā daśa rūpiṇaḥ //	The ten material ḍhātus are agglomerations.

chedo nāma ka eṣa dharmaḥ /	they are cut, when they bear the name of wood, etc. What is the dharma that is called “to cut?
saṃbandhotpādinaḥ saṃghātasrotaso vibhaktotpādanam /	” To cut is to produce the sectioning of the process of an agglomeration the nature of which is to continue itself in an uninterrupted series. The axe cuts a piece of wood which is a series, and makes of it two series which exist and which develop separately.
na kāyendriyādīni cchidyante /	The organs cannot be cut off.
niravaśeṣāṅgacchede tadadvaidhīkaraṇāt / na hīndriyāṇi dvidhā bhavanti /	For example, when all of the parts of the organ of touch or the body are cut off, they are not, for all this, multiple: the members which have been cut, that is to say, separated.

tadeva dahyate tadeva tulayati /	They weigh, for example, when they constitute a scales.

na śabda ucheditvāt /	Sound does not cut off, is not cut off, is not burned, and does not weigh, for it does not exist in a series. There is no agreement with respect to that which is burbed and weighed.
vivādo dagdhṛtulyayoḥ //	There is no agreement with respect to what burns and what is weighed.
kecidāhuḥ tadeva dhātucatuṣṭayaṃ dāhakaṃ tulyaṃ ca	According to some, the same four external dhā$ur burn and are weighed.
kecidāhustejodhātureva dagdhā gurutvameva ca tulyamiti /	According to othets, only the primary element of fire burns, when it menifests its own manner of being in the flame; only weight, which is one type of secondary matter , is weighed: lightweight things, light, etc. , where nevertheless /%pa manifests its.

tatra vipākahetorjātāḥ vipākajāḥ / madhyapadalopāt gorathavat /	Vipākaṭa, "fruition," or literally, "arisen from fruition" instead of "arisen from the cause of fruition", by omission of the middle word, the same way that one says "ox-cart" for "ox-drawn cart. Or else, in the expression vipākaja, "arisen from vépāka," the word vipāka designates not the fruition, but the ripened action, the action arriving at the time period when it gives forth its fruit.
phalakālaprāptaṃ vā karma vipāka ityucyate / vipacyata iti kṛtvā / tasmājjātā vipākajāḥ /	That which arises from ripened action, namely the fruit of retribution, is called "arisen from vipāka.

bhavatu phalahetau phalopacāro yathā phale hetūpacāraḥ / “ṣaḍimāni sparśāyatanāni paurāṇaṃ karma veditavyam“iti /	Or else the expression vÉpākaja, "arisen from fruition," signifies "arisen from the causes of fruition," but one should not say that the word "cause" is omitted. In fact, a cause is often designated by the.
āhārasaṃskārasvapnasamādhiviśeṣairupacitā aupacayikāḥ / brahṃacaryeṇa cetyeke /	that which is accumulated nearby through certain foods, certain actions, certain sleep, or certain absorptions. According to one opinion, chastity is also a cause of accumulation;
anupaghātamātraṃ tu tena syānnopacayaḥ /	but in reality, chastity causes there to be no diminution; it is not a cause of accumulation.
vipākasantānasyopacayasantānaḥ pratiprākāra ivārakṣā /	Matter "of accumulation" protects the matter "of retribution" as a wall does, by surrounding it. Five organs or internal dhatus, with the exclusion of the mental organ, are of fruition and accumulation. They are not outflowing, for they are outflowing only when they are fruition and accumulation.
śabda aupacayiko naiḥṣyandikaścāsti /	Sound is accumulation, for the voice is in a weak state when the body is emaciated. It is also outflowing.

Etiology of sound.

karmabhyo hi vipākajāni mahābhūtāni tebhyaścaupacayikāni tebhyo naiḥṣyandikāni tebhyaḥ śabda iti /	primary elements of outflowing; and sound. Thus sound is not retribution, because it does not immediately proceed from action.
evam tarhi śāhī hikyapi vedanā karmajabhūtasaṃbhūtatvānna vipākaḥ prapnoti /	Objection. To reason thus, bodily sensation, not being ptoduced immediately through action but being immediately produced through the primary elements arisen from action, will not be retribution. Reply. But sensation is not provoked by a desire to experience such.

This is why these three dhātus are called momentary, because, for a moment, they do not proceed from this type of cause.

But smells, tastes and tangibles are not perceived at a distance, and are perceived only when they enter into a close relationship with the otrgan: thus the smell that one person perceives is not perceived by another.

In this hypothesis I would understand that the organ of sight, being capable of being arrested, does not see obscured visible matter.

You would not maintain that “gate” signifies “sight,” for it would be absurd to say “The organ of sight is the sight of the sight of visible matter.”
yadi vijñānaṃ kpaśyati ko vijānāti kaścānayorviśeṣaḥ /	If the visual consciousness sees, what it is that discerns?

yathā nādasyāśrayabhāvāt ghaṇṭā nadatītyucyate” iti /	but, as the organ of sight is the point of support of this consciousness, one says that it sees, the same way one says that the bell rings, because it is the point of support of the sound.
nanu caīvaṃ vijñānasyāśrayabhāvācakṣurvijānātīti prāpnoti /	But, according to this principle, one should also say that the organ of sight discerns, for it is the point of support of the visual consciousness.
na prāpnoti / tadvijñānaṃ darśanamiti ruḍhaṃ loke /	For in the world one agrees to give the name of “seeing” to the visual consciousness;
tathā hi tasminnutpanne rūpaṃ dṛṣṭamityucyate na vijñātam /	in fact, when this consciousness is produced, one says “The color is seen; ” one does not say that the color is discerned.
vibhāṣāyāmapyuktaṃ “cakṣuḥ saṃpraptaṃ cakṣurvijñānānubhūtaṃ dṛṣṭamityucyata” iti /	And the Vibhāṣā confirms; : “One terms 'seen’ that which is attained by the organ of sight, that which falls within its line of vision and is perceived by the visual consciousness.” One says then. In the world that the organ of sight sees, because it is the point of support of the visual consciousness which sees;
tasmāccakṣuḥ paśyatītyevocyate na vijānātīti /	one does not say that it discerns, because the function attributed to the visual consciousness is seeing and not discernment. On the other hand, when one says that consciousness discerns, one does not mean that it discerns to the extent that it would be the point of support of a certain discernment, as one understands that the organ of sight sees because it is the point of support of the visual consciousness.
vijñānaṃ tu sānnidhyamātreṇa rūpaṃ vijānātītyucyate / yathā sūryo divasakara iti /	One means that the consciousness discerns by itself, that it is in and of itself discernment, in the same way that one says that the sun creates the day.

kimidamākāśaṃ khādyate /	What an empty discussion!
cakṣurhi pratītya rūpāṇi cotpadyate cakṣurvijñānam /	The Sutra teaches: “By reason of the organ of sight and of visible matter there arises the visual consciousness”: there is not there either an organ that sees, or visible matter that is seen;
tatra kaḥ paśyati ko vā dṛśyate / nivryāpāraṃ hīdaṃ dharmamātraṃ hetuphalamātraṃ ca /	there is not there any action of seeing, nor any agent that sees;

cakṣuḥ paśyati vijñānaṃ vijānātīti nātrābhiniveṣṭavyam /	In the light of practice, one speaks, metaphorically, of this process: “The eye sees, and the consciousness discerns.” But one should not cling to these metaphors.

tadyadi cakṣuḥ paśyati kimekena cakṣuṣā rūpāṇi paśyatyāhosvidubhābhyām / nātra niyamaḥ /	Is visible matter seen by one eye or by both eyes?

ekasmiṃścīnmīlite cakṣuṣi dvitīye cārdhanimīlite dvicandrādigrahaṇaṃ bhavati / naikatarānyathībhāvāt /	the two eyes being open, sight is clearer.” Furthermore, when one eye is covered and the other half closed, one perceives two moons; but not when one completely closes or half closes that which was open, or when one.
na cāśrayavicchedād vicchedaparasaṅgo vijñānasya deśāpratiṣṭhitatvād raupavaditi /	One should not conclude that the visual consciousness is twofold from the fact that its point of support is twofold, for the consciousness is not material like not having a mass it is not situated in a place.
yadi cakṣuḥ paśyati śrotraṃ śṛṇoti yāvanmano vijānāti kimeṣāṃ prāpto viṣaya āhosvidaprāptaḥ /	We have said that the organ of sight sees, that the organs of hearing, smell, taste, and touch each perceive their objects; and that the mental organ discerns. Do these organs attain their object, do they enter into a close physical relationship with their object?
cakṣuḥśrotramano 'prāptaviṣayaṃ tathā hi dūrādrūpaṃ paśyatyakṣisthamañjanaṃ na paśyati /	The organ of sight, the organ of hearing, and the mental organ know their object without attaining it. The organ of sight sees visible matter at a distance: it does not see the eye-salve placed on the eye;
dūrācchabdaṃ śṛṇoti /	the organ of hearing hears distant sounds. The mental organ, being non-material, does not enter into a close physical relationship with its object.
sati ca prāptaviṣayatve divyaṃ cakṣuḥśrotramiha dhyāyināṃ nopajāyeta / ghrāṇādivat /	If the organs of sight and hearing must necessarily enter into a close relationship with their object, then ascetics in dḥyāna would notattain divine sight or divine hearing, in the same way that they do not attain a divine sense of smell.
yadyaprāptaviṣayaṃ cakṣuḥ kasmānna sarvamaprāptaṃ paśyati dūraṃ tiraskṛtaṃ ca /	If the organ of sight sees an object with which it is not in a close relationship, why does it not see visible matter which is too distant or obscured?

kasmānna sarvaṃ prāptaṃ paśyatyañjanaṃ śalākāṃ vā /	Moreover, the same difficulty remains even if you suppose that the organ enters into a close relationship with the object: why does the organ of sight not see the eye salve, the brush, and all the objects with which it is in close relationship?
yathā ca ghrāṇādīnaṃ prāpto viṣayo na tu sarvaḥ / sahabhūgandhādyagrahaṇāt /	Or else, let us say that the same rule applies to the organ of sight and to the organs of smell and taste: the organ of smell senses only the smell with which it is in close relationship, but it does not sense the odor which constitutes the organ itself;
evaṃ cakṣuṣo 'pyaprāptaḥ syānna tu sarvaḥ / manastvarūpitvāt prāptumevāśaktam /	in the same way, the organ of sight sees only certain distant visible matter, but it does not see all distant visible matter.
kecit punaḥ śrotraṃ praptāprāptaviṣayaṃ manyayante / karṇabhyantare 'pi śabdaśravaṇāt /	According to certain masters, from the fact that one hears noise from the interior of the ear, one can conclude that the organ of hearing. The other three organs, smell, taste, touch, perceive an object with which they are in close relationship.
śeṣaṃ tu ghrāṇajihvākāyākhyam /	For smell, this results from the fact that in-breathing is necessary to the perception of the smell.

prāptaviṣayamityarthaḥ /	What should one understand by the expression “to attain” (to enter into a close relationship)?
ghrāṇaṃ kathaṃ prāptaviṣayam / nirucchvāsasya gandhāgrahaṇāt /	What does one mean when one says that the nose “attains” its object, knows its object “after having attained it?”
keyaṃ prāptirnāma / nirantarotpattiḥ /	To attain is “to arise in morantaratva’ in a state of non-separation. The object, which renews itself from moment to moment, is found to be arisen in moran$aratva with the organ and vice versa. What does nirantara⁴va mean? According to the Bhadanta, immediate juxtaposition, absence of interval; according to the Vaibhāsikas, immediate vicinity, absence of an interposed body.
kiṃ punaḥ paramāṇavaḥ spṛśantyanyonyamāhosvinna /	The question is therefore posed whether the atoms do or do not.
na spṛśantīti kāśmīrakāḥ / kiṃ kāraṇam / yadi tāvat sarvānmanā spṛśeyurmiśrībhaveyurdravyāṇi /	The Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr say that atoms do not touch one another;
athaikadeśena sāvayavāḥ prasajyeran /	if atoms touch one another in their totality, things, that is to say, the different atoms, would “mix with one another,” that is, they would only occupy one place; and if atoms touched each other in one spot, they would thus have parts: and atoms do not have any parts.
niravayavāśca paramāṇavaḥ / kathaṃ śabdābhiniśpattirbhavati / ata eva yadi hi spṛśeyurhasto haste 'bhyāhataḥ sajyeto palaścopale /	But, if there is no contact among the atoms, how is sound produced? For the very reason that there is no contact, sound is possible: if atoms were to touch one aṉother, a hand in collision with a hand would dissolve into it, a rock in collision with another rock would dissolve into it, as gum dissolves into gum. And sound would not be produced.
kathaṃ citaṃ pratyāhataṃ na viśīryate /	But if atoms do not touch one another, why does an agglomeration of atoms not fall to pieces when it is struck?

kathamidānīṃ nirantara prāptyā prāptaviṣayaṃ trayamucyate /	a certain wind element hasOne says that three organs attain their object, because their object is in a state of non-separation from them. What does non-separation consist of?
tadevaiṣāṃ niruttaratvaṃ yanmadhye nāsti kiñcit /	It consists of the fact that there is nothing which is in the interval between the two. This is also what is meant by "to attain,"
apikhlu saṃghātāḥ sāvayavatvāt spṛśantītyadvīṣaḥ /	Furthermore, as agglomerations have parts, there is no difficulty in agglomerations touching one another.

Same question with respect to a thing-outside-of-contact. "One cannot reply in an absolute manner.
kadācit spṛṣṭahetukamaspṛṣṭamutpadhate yadā viśīryate /	Sometimes a thing-outside-of-contact arises from a thing-in-contact, as when a thing-in-contact falls to pieces.

bhadantamataṃ caiṣṭavyam /	see note 189, end).
anyathā hi sāntarāṇāṃ paramāṇūnāṃ śūnyeṣvantareṣu gatiḥ kena pratibadhyeta /	This opinion is the correct one. In fact, if atoms were to allow an interval between themselves, since this interval would be empty, what would hinder the progress of atoms into this interval? For it is admitted that atoms are impenetrable.
yataḥ sapratighā iṣyante / naca paramāṇubhyo 'nye saṃghātā iti /	Agglomerations are not anything other than atoms.
ta eva te saṃghātāḥ paramāṇavaḥ spṛśyante yathā rūpyante /	They are the same atoms which, in a state of aggregation, are a "thing-incontact," in the same way that they are rāpa.
yadi ca paramāṇordigbhāgabhedaḥ kalpyate spṛṣṭasyāspṛṣṭasya vā sāvayavatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	It is thus absurd to. If you admit spatial division to the atom, then an atom certainly has parts, whether it enters into contact or not.

kiṃ punarebhiścakṣurādibhirātmaparimāṇatulyasyārthasya grahaṇaṃ bhavatyāśuvṛttyā ca parvatādīnāmalātakrādivadāhosvittulyātulyasya /	Should we think that the organs solely grasp an object of their dimension,—if one believes that one sees suddenly extended objects, a mountain for example, it is through illusion, it is because one rapidly sees parts of a mountain: it is evidently thus when one sees the circle of fire delineated by an ember;
yāni tāvadetāni prāptaviṣayāṇyuktānyebhiḥ /	:—or else do the organs indifferently grasp an object of their dimension and of a different dimension?
tribhirghrāṇādibhistulyaviṣayagrahaṇaṃ matam /	The three organs of which the organ of smell is the first, grasp an object of their dimension.
yāvanto hīndriyaparamāṇavastāvanto hi viṣayaparamāṇavaḥ sametya vijñānaṃ janayanti /	A given number of atoms of an organ, attaining the same number of atoms of an object, produce consciousness. This also holds for smell, taste, and touch.

Nirvana is generated, appears for the first time, through the first pure faculty, enajnatamajnyasyamindriya. Nirvana lasts, is developed, through the second pure faculty, ajnendriya. Nirvana is experienced by the third pure faculty, jnatavinaraya, for, through this faculty, one experiences the satisfaction and well-being of deliverance. This determines the number of Endriyas, as well as the order in which the Sutra places them.

vācastu nendriyatvaṃ vacane śikṣāviśeṣāpekṣatvāt /	The voice is not predominant with respect to words, for words.
pāṇipādasya cādānaviharaṇādananyatvāt / tadeva hi tadanyathā 'nyatra cotpannamādānaṃ viharaṇaṃ cocyate /	Hands and feet are not predominant with regard to grasping and walking, for grasping and walking are simply the hands and feet arising a second moment in another place and with a new figure.
vināpi ca pāṇipādenādānaviharaṇāduragaprabhṛtīṇām /	On the other hand, we see that hands and feet are not indispensable for grasping and walking, for example with snakes.
pāyorapi nendriyatvamutsarge gurudravyasyākāśe sarvatra patanāt /	The anus is not predominant with regard to the expulsion of matter, for heavy things always fall in a void;
vāyunā ca tatpreraṇāt /	further, wind pushes this matter and makes it go out.
upasthasyāpi nendriyatvamānande strīpuruṣendriyakṛtaṃ hi tat saukhyamiti /	The sexual parts are not predominant with regard to pleasure for pleasure is produced by the sexual organs.
kaṇṭhadantākṣivartmaparvaṇāmapi cābhyavaharaṇacarvaṇonmeṣanimeṣākuñcanavikāśana kriyāsvindriyatvaṃ prasajyeta /	If you consider the hands, the feet, etc. , as indriyas, you must then place the throat, the teeth, the eyelids, and the joints, whose function it is to swallow, to chew, to open and close, to fold up and to extend the bones, among the indriyas.
sarvasya vā kāraṇabhūtasya svasyāṃ kariyāyāmityayukataṃ vāgādīnāmindriyatvam //	In this way, everything that is a cause, which exercises its action with regard to its effects, would be an indriya.
tatra cakṣurādīnāṃ puruṣendriyaparyantānāṃ kṛto nirdeśaḥ /	But we must reserve the name of indriya to. We have defined the organs of consciousness and the sexual organs;
jīvitendriyasya viprayuktatvādviprayukteṣveva karisyate nirdeśaḥ / śraddhādīnāṃ caitteṣu kariṣyate /	the vital organ will be explained with the cittaviprayuktas among which it is placed; the five faculties being mental states will be explained with the mental states: We shall examine here the organs of sensation and the pure faculties which are not found anywhere else.
sukhādīnāmājñāsyāmīndriyādīnāṃ ca karttavyaḥ / so 'yaṃ kriyate /	Disagreeable bodily sensation is the indriya of pain.
duḥkhendriyamaśātā yā kāyikī vedanā	"Bodily" is "that which relates to the body," that which is associated with the five sense consciousnesses, visual consciousness, etc. "Disagreeable" is that which does harm. Sensation in relation to the five organs of sense consciousness, and which does harm, is called dukkhenariya. Agreeable is the indriya of pleasure.
aśātetyupadhātikā duḥkhetyarthaḥ / sukham / śātā	"Agreeable" is that which does good, which comforts, is beneficent.
sukhendriyaṃ kāyikī śāta vedanā /	Agreeable bodily sensation is termed sukha-indriya.
śātetyanugrāhikā sukhetyarthaḥ / dhyāne tṛtīye tu caitasī sā sukhendriyam //	In the Third Dhyana, agreeable mental sensation is also an indriya of pleasure.
tṛtīye tu dhyāne saiva śātā vedanā caitasī sukhendriyam /	Agreeable mental sensation of the Third Dhyāna is also called sukhendriya, an indriya of pleasure. This name, moreover, is reserved for agreeable bodily sensation;
nahi tatra kāyikī vedanā 'sti / pañcavijñānakāyābhāvāt / anyatra sā saumanasyaṃ	but in the Third Dhyāṇna, bodily sensation is absent because the five sense consciousnesses are not there.
tṛtīyāddhyānādanyatra kāmadhātau prathame dvitīye ca dhyāne sā caiatasikī śātā vedanā saumanasyendriyam /	Then, when one speaks of the sukha or pleasure of the Third Dhyāna, one means agreeable mental sensation. Moreover, it is satisfaction. “Moreover,” that is, in the stages below the Third Dhyāna, in Kāmadhātu and in the first two Dhyānas, agreeable mental sensation is satisfaction or the ndriya of satisfaction.
tṛtīye tu dhyāne prītivītarāgatvāt sukhendriyameva sā na saumanasyendriyam /	In the Third Dhyāna, agreeable mental sensation is calm and tranquil, because the ascetic, in this Dhyāṇna, is detached from joy: hence it is pleasure and not satisfaction. Below the Third Dhyāna, agreeable mental sensation is gross and agitated, because, in the stages below the Third Dhyāna, the ascetic is not detached from joy: hence it is “satisfaction.”
prītirhi saumanasyam / aśātā caitasī punaḥ /	Joy, is not distinct frorn satisfaction.
daurmanasyamupekṣā tu madhyā	Intermediate bodily or mental sensation is equanimity.
naivaśātānāśātā aduḥkhāsukhā vedanā madhyetyucyate / sopekṣendriyam /	Intermediate sensation, which neither comforts nor harms, is the sensation “neither-pain-nor-pleasure.” This is what is termed the sensation or ndaraya of equanimity.
kiṃ kāyikī caitasikītyāha /	Is this sensation bodily or mental?
ubhayī kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇamiyamabhisamasyai kamindriyaṃ kriyate /	It is both. Either bodily or mental, intermediate sensation is a sensation of equanimity. The sensation of equanimity presents then a double characteristic, consequently it constitutes only one indriya, because there is no vikalpana here.
avikalpanāt //	For it has no vikalpana. There is no vikalpana, or intellectual operation. Either bodily or mental, the sensation of equanimity is equally free from any intellectual element.
caitasikaṃ hi sukhaduḥkhaṃ prāyeṇa vikalpanādutpadyate na tu kāyikam / viṣayavaśādarhatāmapyutpatteḥ /	As a general rule, agreeable or disagreeable mental sensation proceeds from a concept, from the concept of “dear” or “hateful,” etc. Contrarily, bodily. Arhats do not have sympathies and antipathies, they do not conceive of the idea of dear or the idea of hateful, and yet they are subject nevertheless to physical pain and pleasure.
atastayorindriyatvena bhedaḥ / upekṣā tu svarasenāvikalpayata evotpadyate kāyikī caitasikī ce tyekamindriyam kriyate / anyathā ca kāyikam sukhamanugṛhṇātyanyathā caitasikam /	Then we should distinguish ndriyas relative to agreeable and disagreeable sensations accordingly as these sensation are bodily or mental.
evam duḥkhamanyathā kāyikamupahantyanyathā caitasikam /	But the sensation of equanimity is produced spontaneously, exactly like a physical sensation; it is produced in a person who does not form any concept: hence we recognize that there is but one ndriya for the two sensations of bodily and mental indifference.
upekṣāyāṃ tveṣa vikalpo nāstyata upekṣaṇaṃ pratyavikalpanādabhedaḥ /	There is no vikalpana or difference. Accordingly as the agreeable or disagreeable sensations are bodily or mental, they do good or harm according to a mode of operation that is special to them, and they are not felt in the same way. The sensation of equanimity creates neither good or harm; it is not differentiated; mental or physical, it is felt in.
dṛgbhāvanā 'saikṣapathe nava trīṇi manaḥ sukhasaumanasyopekṣāḥ sraddhādīni ca pañca /	The mental organ, the sensation of pleasure, the sensation of satisfaction, the sensation of equanimity, and faith, force, memory, absorption and discernment constitute the anajnatamajnasyaminariya for the saint who is on the Path of Seeing;
tāni navendriyāṇi triṣu mārgeṣu trīṇīndriyāṇyucyante /	ajnendriya for the saint who is on the Path of Meditation on the Truths;
darśanamārge anājñātamājñāsyāmīndriyaṃ bhāvanāmārge ājñendriyam aśaikṣamārge ājñātāvīndriyamiti / kiṃ kāraṇam /	and gnatavinariya for the saint who is on the path of the Asaiksa. On the Path of Seeing, the saint is engaged in knowing that which he does not know, namely the Four Truths: he thinks “I will know. ” His ndriya is then called the anajnatamajnasyaminariya.
darśanamārge hyanājñātamājñātuṃ pravṛttaḥ / bhāvanāmārge nāstyapūrvamājñeyaṃ tadeva tvājānāti śeṣānuśayaprahāṇārtham /	On the Path of Meditation on the Truths, the saint does not have anything new to know, he is a wise one or ina. But in order to cut off the defilements which remain in him, he newly knows and often repeats the Truths that he already knows. His ndriya is called the ajnenariya, the indriya of the wise one, or the wise indriya.
aśaikṣamārge tvājñātmityavagama ājñātāvaḥ /	On the Path of the Aśaikṣa, the ascetic becomes conscious that he knows: he obtains the knowledge that the Truths are known.
so 'syāstīti ājñātāvī / ājñātamavituṃ śīlamasyeti vā / kṣayānutpādijñānalābhāt /	Possessing ājñāta-ava, he is an ājñātāviṉ, and his indriya is called the jñātāvīndriya.
“duḥkhaṃ me parijñātaṃ na punaḥ parijñātavyamiti” tathābhūtasyenriyamājñātāvīnriyam /	Or rather, the saint who is an ġñātāvéṉ is one who has for his characteristics or habit knowing that the Truth is known: in fact, when the saint has obtained kṣayajñána aṇḍ anutpādajñāna, he knows in truth, “Pain is known; I have nothing more to know” and the rest.

We must explain their different natures: are they pure, from retribution, good? To what sphere do they belong? How are they abandoned? How many are impuṟe? How many are pure?
amalaṃ trayam /	Three are clean;
anāsravamityarthaḥ / malānāmāsravaparyāyatvāt /	The last three indriyas are exclusively clean or pure.

anāsravāṇyeva śraddhādīnītyeke / uktaṃ hi bhagavatā “yasyemāni pañcendriyāṇi sarveṇa srvaṃ na santi tamahaṃ bāhyaṃ pṛthagjanapakṣāvasthitaṃ vadāmī“ti / nedaṃ jñāpakamanāsravāṇyadhikṛtya vacanāt /	According to other masters, the five moral faculties are solely pure, for the Blessed One said: “Whosoever is completely lacking, to whatever degree, any of these five indriyas, faith, etc. , I declare him to be a person outside, one who belongs to the class of Pṛthagjanas.”
tathā hyāryapudgalavyavasthānaṃ kṛtvā yasyemānītyāha /	Hence anyone who possesses them, to whatever degree, is an Āryaṇ; hence they are pure. This text is not proof, for the Blessed One is speaking here of a person in whom the five pure moral faculties are absent. In fact, in the passage that precedes the quotation in question, the Blessed OneHence he is referring to only the five moral faculties belonging to the Āryans, that is, pure. Whosoever is lacking them is evidently a Pr̥thagjana.
pṛthagjano vā dvividhaḥ /	Or rather, if this passage speaks of moral faculties in general, we would remark that there are two types of Pṛthagjana: those outside, and those inside;
ābhyantarakaścāsamucchinna kuśalamūlo bāhyakaśca samucchinnakuśalamūlaḥ /	the first have cut off the roots of good, whereas the second have not cut them off.
tamadhikāṛtyāha “bāhyaṃ pṛthagjanapakṣāvasthitaṃ vadāmī“ti /	It is with reference to the first that the Blessed One said: “I declare him to be a person outside, one who belongs to the class of Pṛthagjanas.”
uktaṃ ca sūtre “santi ca sattvā loke jātā loke vṛddhāstīkṣṇendriyā api madhyendriyā api mṛdvindriyā apī” tyapravarttita eva dharmacakre /	On the other hand, according to the Sūtra, even before setting into motion the Wheel of the Dharma, there were in the world persons of sharp, medium, and weak faculties.
tasmātsantyeva sāsravāṇi śraddhādīni /	Hence the moral faculties of faith, etc. , are not necessarily and exclusively pure.
punaścoktaṃ “yāvacchāhameṣāṃ pañcānāmindriyāṇāṃ samudayaṃ cāstagamaṃ ca svādaṃ cādīnavaṃ ca niḥsaraṇaṃ ca yathābhūtaṃ nādhyajñāsiṣaṃ na tāvadahamasmātsadevakāllokādi“ti vistaraḥ /	Finally, the Blessed One said: “If I do not know truly the origin, the disappearance, the advantages, the disadvantages, the escape of the five. ”I shall not be liberated, gone out, disassociated, delivered from the world of gods, Māras, and Brahmās, of a worId wherein there are Brahmins and monks; I shall not reṣide with a mind free from error.
na cānāsravāṇāṃ dharmāṇāmeṣa parīkṣāprakāraḥ //	Now a similar description does not apply to pute dharmas, which are free from advantages, from disadvantages, and from escape. Hence the moral faculties of faith, force, etc. , can be either pure or impure.
katīndriyāṇi vipākaḥ kati na vipākaḥ / ekāntena tāvat	Among the ²ndriyas, how many are retribution, and how many are not retribution?
vipāko jīvitaṃ	The vital organ is always retribution.
atha yadarhan bhikṣurāyuḥsaṃskārān sthāpayati tajjīvitendriyaṃ kasya vipākaḥ /	Of what action is the vital organ thus stabilized or prolonged the retribution?

bhadantaghoṣakastvāha / tasminneva āśraye rūpāvacarāṇi mahābhūtāni dhyānabalena saṃmudhakarotyāyuṣo 'nukūlāni vaihodhikāni ca /	”The Bhadaūṇta Ghoṣaka said: By the force of the prāntakoṭika Dhyāṇna that this Arhat produced, the primary elements of Rūpadhātu are attracted and introduced into his body.

tasmānna tajjīvitendriyaṃ vipākaṃ tato 'nyattu vipākaḥ /	Thus the vital organ, in the case of the prolonged life of an Arhat, is not retribution. But in other cases, it is retribution.

anyathā naiva saṃskāragrahaṇamakariṣyadityapare /	If it were otherwise, the Sūtra would not use the expression “the jāvita-skandhas; ” it would say “The Blessed One extends somne jṝvias, and casts off some āyus.”

jīvitendriyādanyāni dvādaśa dvividhāni vipākaścāvipākaśca /	With the exception of the vital organ, which is always retribution, and of the nine that will be mentioned below which are never retribution, the remaining twelve are of two types, sometimes retribution, and sometimes non-retribution. This refers to the seven material organs, to the mental organ and to the four sensations, the sensation of.
tatra cakṣurādīni saptaupacayikāni avipākaḥ /	The seven material organs are not retribution to the extent that they arise from accumulation.
śeṣāṇi vipākaḥ /	In other cases, they are retribution.
manoduḥkhasukhasaumanasyopekṣendriyāṇi kuśalakliṣṭānya vipākaḥ /	The mental organ and the four organs of sensation are not retribution when they are good or soiled, for whatever is retribution is morally neutral.

śeṣāṇi vipākaḥ / jīvitendriyaṃ cakṣurādīni dvādaśa hitvā śeṣāṇyavipāka iti siddham /	In other cases, they are retribution. The last eight, faith, etc. , the aṉājñātamājñasyāmīndriya, etc. , are good and consequently are not retribution. But, we would say;
yadi dauarmanasyendriyaṃ na vipāka iti sūtraṃ kathaṃ nīyate “trīṇi kāryāṇi /	how can one affirm that dissatisfaction is never retribution?
saumanasyavedanīyaṃ karma daurmanasyavedanīyaṃ karma upekṣā vedanīyaṃ karme“ti saṃprayogavedanīyatāmadhikṛtyoktam /	In fact, the Sūtra says, “There is an action liable to result in satisfaction, there is an action liable to result in dissatisfaction, and there is an action liable to result in a sensation of equanimity.
daurmasyena saṃprayuktaṃ karma daurmanasyavedanīyam /	” The expression daurmanasyavedanīya should be understood not as “an action that should be experienced, resulting in a sensation of dissatisfaction,” but rather as.
yathā sukhasaṃparayuktaḥ sparśaḥ sukhavedanīyaḥ /	In fact, the Sūtra says that contact is snmkha-vedanīya: now pleasure is not the retribution of contact.
saumanasyopekṣāvedanīye api tarhi karmaṇī evaṃ bhaviṣyataḥ / yathecchasi tathā 'stu /	From all evidence, swkhavendanīya contact is contact with which a sensation of pleasure is associated. Hence davrmanasya-vedanīya action is action with which a sensation of dissatisfaction is associated. You should explain the expressions saurnanasya-vedanīya aṇd upekṣa-vedanīya as you explain the expression daurmaṇaṣya-vendanīya, since the three expressions figure in the same context in the Sūtra. It follows that a sa#rmanasya-vedanīya action is an action “with which the sensation of satisfaction is associated,” not an action “liable to retribution in satisfaction; and it foḻlows that as a consequence, the sensation of satisfaction is not retributioṉ.
saṃprayoge 'pi na doṣaḥ vipāke 'pi na doṣaḥ / agatyā hyetadevaṃ gamyeta /	We see no problēm in explaining the expression sa#rmanasya-vedaniya either as “liable to retribution in satisfaction” or as “that with which satisfaction is associated. ” But theIt refers to an action with which dissatisfaction is associated.
kā punratra yuktirdaurmanasyaṃ na vipāka iti /	One could admit your interpretation of the Sūtra if there were no other issue, that is, if it had been rationally established that dissatisfaction is not retribution.
daurmanasyaṃ hi parikalpaviśeṣairutpādyate ca vyupaśāmyate ca /	Dissatisfaction is produced by the imagination, when one thinks of something that he fears; he is assuaged in the same way: when he thinks of something that he desires.
nacaivam vipākaḥ /	Now such is not the case with retribution.
saumanasyamapyevaṃ na syādvipākaḥ /	This is the case for satisfaction which will consequently not be retribution.
yadi tarhi daumanasyaṃ vipākaḥ syādānantaryakāriṇāṃ tannimittaṃ daurmanasyotpādāttatkarma vipakvaṃ syāt / saumanasyamapyevam /	If, as you maintain, dissatisfaction is retribution, when a person has committed a serious transgression and then experiences, with regard to it, dissatisfaction and remorse, one could say that the transgression has already brought forth a ripened result—which is inadmissible.
yadi saumanasyaṃ vipākaḥ syāt puṇyakāriṇāṃ tannimittaṃ saumanasyotpādāttatkarma vipakvaṃ syāt /	But you admit that satisfaction is retribution, and we would reason as you have just done: when a person has accomplished a meritorious.
vītarāgāṇāṃ tarhi daurmanasyāsaṃbhavāt /	Persons who are detached from desire do not experience dissatisfaction.
na caivaṃ vipākaḥ / saumanasyamapyeṣāmavyākṛtaṃ kodṛśaṃ vipākaḥ syāt / yādṛśaṃ tādṛśamastu /	They possess the organs of seeing and other senses, but not the organ of dissatisfaction, which is not considered retribution.
sati tu saṃbhave saumanasyasyāsti vipākāvakāśī na dauarmanasyasya /	Detached persons possess a satisfaction that arises from absorption, which is not retribution. They possess the indriya of satisfaction, which can be the nature of this organ, whether it be retribution or not.

Admits of the sensation of satisfaction. Disjunction from the defilements results then from equanimity and from satisfaction; in this same way we have seen that disjunction, in the case of the Srotaāpaṇṇna, results from jñāṣyāmīndáriya and ājñenādriya.
tatrahi navame vimuktimārge saumanasyendriyamaṣṭamaṃ /	When he expels the defilements through the pure path, that is, through Meditation on the Truths, one must add the āgñendriya as a ninth jnáriya.

sarva ime dharmāḥ pañca bhavanti /	Certain conditioned dharmas are divided into five categories: rāpa or physical matter; cāka or the mind;

yadyatra paṭutamaṃ prabhāvata udbhūtaṃ tasya tatropalabdhiḥ /	In the same way, when one touches a pile of pieces of plants and needles, one perceives the needles;

kathaṃ punasteṣu śeṣāstitvaṃ gamyate /	How does one know that a given aggregate consists of the primary elements when their presence in it is not perceived?
karmataḥ saṃgrahaghṛtipaktivyūhanāt /	All of the primary elements manifest their presence through their own actions, namely support, cohesion, maturing.
pratyayalābhe ca sati kaṭhinādīnāṃ dravaṇā dibhāvāt apsu śaityātiśayādauṣṇyaṃ gamyata ityapare / avyati bhede 'pi tu syācchaityātiśayaḥ /	According to another opinion, that of the Bhadanta Śrīlabha, the aggregates are made up of the four primary elements, since, given the action of certain causes, solid things become liquid, etc. The fire element exists in water, since this latter is more or less cold, a fact which is explained by the presence of the element of fire in a more or less great quantity. But, we would say, whether cold is more or less active does not imply that there has been a mixture of a certain substance, the cold, with its opposite, heat.
śabdavedanātiśayavat /	So too sound and sensation, even though homogeneous, vary in intensity.
bījatas teṣu teṣāṃ bhāvo na svarūpata ityapare /	According to another opinion, the primary elements which are not perceived in a given aggregate exist in the state of potentiality, and not in action, and not in and of themselves. Thus the Blessed One was able to say (Semyuktagama, TD, p.
“santyasmin dāruskandhe vividhā dhātava“iti vacanāt /	, a), “There are many dhaeus or mineral substances in this piece of wood.” The Blessed One meant that this piece of wood contained the seeds, the potentialities of many dhatu; for gold, silver, etc. , do not exist in the wood at the present time.

We will have six, seven, or eight substances, and when sound intervenes, seven, eight, or nine. We shall not explain this in detail.

In the first hypothesis the numbers proposed are too few.
avaśyaṃ hi taddravyasaṃsthānenāpi bhavitavyam / tasyāpi paramāṇusaṃcitatvāt / gurutvalaghutvayoścānyatareṇa ślakṣṇatvakarkaśatvayośca /	A molecule, you say, consists of four “derived elements,” r%pa first: it will consist of, we would say, not only of the rūpa of color (varṇa, blue or red dravya, etc. ) but also of the r%pa of figure, since many atoms are agglomerated in these. It consists of the “derived matter” called “tangible:” it will be, we should say, heavy or light, hard.
śītenāpi kvacit jighatsayā pipāsayā ca /	It could be cold or hunger, or thirst; it then consists of the dravyas that are either heaviness or lightness, softness or hardness, cold, hunger and thirst. Hence the numbers proposed above are too few.
athāpyāyatanadravyaṃ gṛhyate ayivahṇidamucyate aṣṭadravyaka iti /	But if, on the contrary, the Vaibhāṣikas mean to speak of dravyas as āyatanas, then the numbers are still too few, for the primary elements form part of the āyatana "tangible";
caturdravyako hi vaktavyo yāvatā bhūtānyapi spraṣṭavyāyatanam /	one should then say that a molecule consists of four substances, visible, odor, taste, and touch. Our definition of a molecule is the best one.
kiñcidatra dravyameva dravyaṃ gṛhyate yadāśrayabhūtaṃ kiñcidatrāyatanaṃ dravyaṃ gṛhyate yadāśritabhūtam /	The word dravya is to be understood, in this case, as substances properly so-called, and as āyatanas.
evamapi bhūyāṃsi bhūtadravyāṇi bhavantyupādāyarūpāṇāṃ pratyekaṃ bhūtacatuṣkāśritatvāt / atra punarjātidravyaṃ gṛhyate /	Among the eight dravyas of a molecule, there are four substances properly so-called, the four primary elements, the supports and sources of derived matter;
bhūtacatuṣkāntarāṇāṃ svajātyanatikramāt /	and four āyatanas, four types of derived matter, supported by the primary elements: visibles, odors, tastes and tangibles. The molecule will then consist of twenty dravyas. No, for we are speaking of the nature of the primary elements, solidity, etc. The nature of all four of the primary elements remains the same, in that they support the derived element of odor or the derived elements of visibles, tastes, and tangibles.
kaḥ punaryatsa evaṃ vikalpena vaktum /	But why do you express yourself in an ambiguous manner and use the word dravya in two different meanings?
cchandato 'pi hi vācāṃ pravṛttirarthastu parīkṣyaḥ / ukto rūpiṇāṃ sahotpādaniyamaḥ / śeṣāṇāṃ vaktavyastatra tāvat /	Words are subject to caprice, but one must examine their meaning.

bhūmirnāma gativiśayaḥ /	Bhūmi or sphere signifies “place of origin.
yo hi yasya gativiśayaḥ sa tasya bhūmirityucyate / [054/15-054/16	” The place of origin of a dharma is the bhūmi of this dharma. The “great sphere” or mahābhāmi is so called because it is the sphere, the place of origin, of great dharmas (that is, of dharmas of great extension, that are found everywhere).
tatra mahatī bhūmireśāmiti mahābhūmikāḥ ye sarvatra cetasi bhavanti /	The dharmas that areInherent in the mahābhūmi are called mahābhūmika, that is, the dharmas that are always found in all minds.

vedanā cetanā saṃjñā cchandaḥ sparśo matiḥ smṛtiḥ / manaskāro 'dhimokṣaśca samādhiḥ sarvacetasi //	Sensation, volition, motion, desire for action, contact, discernment, memory, the act of attention, approval, and absorption or concentration coexist in every mind.

matiḥ prajñā dharmapravicayaḥ /	Prajñā, which the Kārikā designates under the name of 7muari, is.
smṛtirālambanāsaṃpramoṣaḥ /	Smrṭi is non-failing with regard to the object; a dharma by virtue of which the mind does not forget the object, by virtue of which it cherishes it in order to so express it.
manaskāraścetasa ābhogaḥ /	Manaskāra īs the modification of the mind; in other words, “to bend” or “to apply” the mind towards an object.
adhimokṣo 'dhimuktiḥ /	Adhimukti īs approval.
samādhiścittasyaikāgratā /	Samadhi is the unity of the object with the mind: this is the dharma by virtue of which the mind, in an uninterrupted series, remains on an object. How do we know that these ten mental states, distinct in nature, coexist in one and the same mind?
sūkṣmo hi cittacaittānāṃ viśeṣaḥ /	Subtle, unquestionably, are the specific characteristics of the mind and its mental states. One discerns them, only with difficulty even when one is content to consider each of the mental states as developing in a homogeneous series;

The “sphere” of the good dharmas of great extension is termed kuśalamāhabhūmi.
kuśalā mahābhūmireṣāṃ ta ime kuśala mahābhūmikā ye sarvadā kuśale cetasibhavanti / ke punasta iti /	The mental states that arise from this sphere are termed kuśalamabhābhūmśkas: the dharmas that are found in all good minds.

tatra śraddhā cetasaḥ prasādaḥ /	Śraddha or faith is clarification of the mind.
satyaratna karmaphalābhisaṃpratyaya ityapare /	According to another opinion, it is adherence to the doctrine of the results of actions, to the Three Precious Ones, and to the Truths. Apramāda or diligence is bhāvanā, that is, the taking possession of, and the cultivation of good dharmas. The taking possession of and the cultivation of good dharmas is none other than the good dharmas being grasped and.
apramādaḥ duśalānāṃ dharmāṇāṃ bhāvanāḥ /	Diligence is application to good dharmas.
kā punaste bhyo 'nyā bhāvanā /	One says, by metaphor, that it is bhāvaná.
yā teṣvavahitatā /	By this fact, it is the cause of bhāvaṇā.
cetasa ārakṣeti nikāyāntarītāḥ sūtre paṭhanti /	According to another school, diligence is the guarding of the mind.
praśrabdhiścittakarmaṇyatā /	Prasrabdhi is the dharma through which the mind is clever, light, and apt.
nanu ca sūtre kāyapraśrabdhirapyuktā / na khalu noktā /	But, does not the Sutra speak of the praśrabdbi of the body? The Sūtra speaks of the prasrabdhi of the body as it speaks of bodily sensation. All sensation is, in its nature, mental; sometimes the Sūtra terms the sensation that has for its support the five organs constituted of atoms a “bodily” sensation associated with the five sense consciousnesses.
sā tu yathā kāyikī vedanā tathā veditavyā /	In the same way that prasrabdhi of the mind depends on the five organs, praśrabdhi of the five sense consciousnesses is termed “praśrabdhi of the body.”
kathaṃ sā bodhyaṅgeṣu yokṣyate /	How can the praśrabdhi of the body, thus understood, be counted among the parts of Bodhi (saṁbodhyaṁga, vi68)? In fact, the five sense consciousnesses are of the sphere of. Kāmadhātu, for they are not “absorbed,” that is, they are not produced in the state of absorption, whereas the parts of Bodhi are “absorbed”.
tatra tarhi kāyakarmaṇyataiva kāyikī praśrabdhirveditavyā /	Thus, in our opinion, in the Sūtra alluded to, prasrabdhi of the body is aptitude of the body.
kathaṃ sā bodhyaṅgamitayucyate /	How can prasrabdhi of the body, thus understood, be a part of Bodhi? The aptitude of the body is, in fact, impure.
bodhyaṅgānukūlyāt /	But it is propitious to prafrabdhi of the mind, which is a part of Bodhi;
sā hi kāyakarmaṇyatā cittakarmaṇyatā bodhyaṅgamāvahati /	for this reason it receives the name “part of Bodhi.
asti punaḥ svacit anyatrāpyevaṃ dṛśyate / astītyāha /	” The Sūtra often expresses itself in this manner.
tadyathā prītiḥ prītisthānīyāśca dharmāḥ prītisaṃbodhyaṅgamuktaṃ bhagavatā /	For example, it teaches that joy constitutes the part of Bodhi called joy.
pratighaḥ pratighanimittaṃ ca vyāpādanivaraṇamuktam /	It teaches that hostility and the causes of hostility constitute the obstacle of wickedness.
samyakdṛṣṭisaṃkalpavyāyāmāśca prajñāskandha uktāḥ /	It teaches that insight, resolution, and effort constitute “the element of speculative consciousness”: for neither resolution, which is by its nature discursive thought, nor effort, which is by nature energy, are speculative consciousness;
naca saṃkalpavyāyāmau prajñāsvabhāvau tasyāstvanuguṇāviti tāsyātvanuguṇāviti tācchaydyaṃ labhete /	but they are favorable to this consciousness and are, consequently, considered as.
evaṃ kāyapraśrabdhirapi bodhyaṅgānuguṇyādvodhyaṅgaśabdaṃ labhate /	Prafrabāhi of the body, being a condition of prastabdhi of the mind, is placed, as are these, with these, among the parts of Bodhi.
upekṣā cittasamatā cittānābhogatā / kathamidānīmetadyokṣyate /	Upekṣā or equanimity, is mental indifference, the dharma by which the mind remains equal, even, free from modification. If all minds are associated with attention, which is of the nature of “inflexion” or modification, how can all good minds be associated with equanimity, which is by its nature noninflexion? We have already remarked on this: the specific characteristics of the mind and its mental states are very difficalt to know and determine. This is not the point;
“tatraiva citte ābhogātmako manaskāro 'nābhogātmikā copekṣe“ti / nanu coktaṃ “durjñāna eṣāṃ viśeṣa” iti / asti hi nāma durjñānamapi jñāyate / idam tu khalvatidurjñānaṃ yadvirodhe 'pyavirodha iti /	it is quite inadmissible that the same mind be associated with mental states which repudiate both modification and non-modification, and both pleasure and displeasure.

cetasa iti paścādvakṣyati /	The grossness, that is, the gross state of the mind is termed.
cittaudārikatā vitarkaḥ / cittasūkṣmatā vicāraḥ /	The subtlety, that is, the subtle state of the mind is termed vicāra.
kathaṃ punaḥ anayorekatra citte yogaḥ /	How can vitarka and vicāra be associated with the mind at one and the same time?
kecidāhuḥ /	Can the mind, at one and the same time, be both gross and subtle? According to one opinion, we may compare vicāra to cold water, the mind to cheese which floats on the surface of this cold water, and vitarka to the heat of the sun which operates on this cheese.
yathā 'pyasuniṣṭhyūtaṃ sarpiḥ sūryaraśmibhirūpariṣṭātspṛṣṭaṃ nātiśyāyate nātivilīyate	By reason of the water and sun, the cheese is not too runny nor too hard.
evaṃvitarkavicārayogāccittaṃ nātisūkṣmaṃ bhavati nātyodārika mityubhayorapi tatrāsti vyāpāraḥ /	In this same way, vitarka and vicāra are associated with the mind: it is neither too subtle, by reason of vitarka, nor too gross, by reason of vicāra.
evaṃ tarhi nimiṭtabhūtau vitarkavicārāvaudārika sūkṣmatayoḥ prāpnuto yathā payaścā tapaścasarpiṣaḥ śyānatva vilīnatvayornatu punastatsvabhāvau	But, we would say, it follows from this explanation that vitarka and vicāra are not grossness and subtlety of mind, but the cause of its grossness and its subtlety: the cold water and the warm light of the sun are not the hard or the runny state of the cheese, but rather the cause of these states. Other objections present themselves.
āpekṣikī caudārikasūkṣmatā bhūmiprakārabhedādityābhavāgrādvitarkavicārau syātām /	Grossness and subtlety of. Mind are relative things. They admit of many degrees: a mind of the First Dhyāna is subtle in comparison with a mind in Kāmadhātu, but gross in comparision with a mind in the Śecond Dhyāna; the qualities and the defilements can be more or less gross or subtle in one and the same stage, for they are divided into nine categories.
nacaudārikasūkṣmātayā jātibhedo yukataḥ //	Thus, if vūarka and vicāra are grossness and subtlety of the mind, we would have to admit that they both exist up to the highest stage of Ārūpyadhātu. Now they cease at the Second Dhyāna, and adding to this the fact that no specific or generic differences can be established between grossness and subtlety, one then cannot differentiate viśaréa and vicāra.
anye punarāhuḥ / vāksaṃskārā vitrkavicārāḥ sūtra uktāḥ /	According to another opinion, vitarka and wvicāra are the “factors of voice.”
“vitarkya vicārya vācaṃ bhāṣate nāvitasryāvicārye“ti /	The Sūtra says in fact, "It is after having examined, after having judged that one speaks, not without having examined, not without having judged.” The factors of voice that are called gross are called vôtarkas;
tatra ye audārikāste vitarkāḥ ye sūkṣmāste vicārāḥ /	those that are subtle are called vicāras. (According to this explanation, we should)Understand vrtarka and vÉeāra not as two distinct dharmas, but rather a collection of mind and mental states which provoke speech, and which is sometimes gross, sometimes subtle.
yadi caikatra citte 'nyo dharma audāriko 'nyaḥ sūkṣmaḥ ko 'tra virodha iti /	What contradiction is there in two dharmas, the first gross, and the second subtle, being associated with the same mind? There would not be any contradiction if these two dharmas were specifically different;
na syādvirodho yadi jātibhedaḥ syādvedanāsaṃjñāvat /	for example, sensations and ideas—although the first are gross and the second subtle—can coexist.
ekasyāṃ jātau mṛdvadhimātratā yugapanna saṃbhavati / jātibhedo /pyasti /	But two states of the same species, one in a strong state and the other in a weak state, one gross and one subtle, cannot coexist. But there is a specific difference between viṭarka aṇḍ vicāra.
sa tarhi vaktavyaḥ / durvaco hyasāvato mṛdvadhimātratayā vyajyate /	What is this difference?
naivaṃ vyakto bhavati /	This difference is inexpressible; but it is manifested through the force or the weakness of the mind.
pratyekaṃ jātīnāṃ mṛdvadhimātratavāt /	The force and the weakness of the mind do not demonstrate the presence of two specifically different dharmnas, for the same species is sometimes strong, sometimes weak.
naiva hi vitarkavicārāvekatra citte bhavata ityapare /	According to another opinion, ours, vôarka and vicāra are not. The Vaibhāṣikas would object that the First Dhyāna has five parts among which are viarka and vicāra.
kathamidānīṃ prathamaṃ dhyānaṃ pañcāṅgayuktam / bhūmitastat pañcāṅgayukataṃ na kṣaṇataḥ //	We would answer that the First Dhyana has five parts in the sense that five parts are possible in the First Dhyāna: but any given moment of the First Dhyāna possesses only four parts, namely prii, sukha, and samādhi, plus vitarka or vicāra.
mānamadayoḥ kiṃ nānākāraṇam /	What difference is there between maṇa and wmada?
māna unnatiḥ /	Māna, the error of pride, is arrogance.
madaḥ svadharme raktasya paryādānaṃ tu cetasaḥ //	But mada, prideintoxication, is the abolition of the mind of one who is enamoured with his own qualities.
yena kenacit parato viśeṣaparikalpena cetasa unnatiḥ mānaḥ /	It is arrogance of mind with respect to others. Measuring the superiority of qualities that one has, or that one believes to have over others, one becomes bhaughty and depreciates others.
madastu svadharmeṣveva raktasya yaccetasaḥ paryādānam /	Be reason of its attachment to its own qualities, the mind becomes puffed up, exhaults itself, and abolishes itself.
yathā madyaja evaṃ rāgajaḥ / saṃprahaṛśaṇaviśeṣo mada ityapare /	Accoṟding to other Masters, in the same way that wine produces a certain joyous excitation.
uktāḥ saha cittena caittāḥ prakāraśa steṣāṃ punarimāḥ saṃjñāḥ paribhāṣyante / pravacana etābhiḥ sadvyavahārāt /	We have seen in what categories the mental states are placed, in what numbers they are generated together, and what their different characteristics are. The mind and its mental states receive, in the Scriptures, different names.
cittaṃ mano 'tha vijñānamekārthaṃ	The names mind, spirit, and consciousness designate the same thing.
cinotīti cittam /	The mind is termed citta because it accumulates;
manuta iti manaḥ / vijānātīti vijñānam /	it is termed manas because it knows, and it is termed vijnana because it distinguishes its object.
cittaṃ śubhāśubhairdhātubhiriti cittam /	Some say that the mind is termed citta because it is spotted by good and bad elements.
tadevāśrayabhutaṃ manaḥ /	To the extent that it is the support of the mind that follows, it is manas;
āśritabhūtaṃ vijñānamityapare /	and to the extent that it grasps the support through the organ and its object, it is vijnana.
yathā cittaṃ mano vijñānamityeko 'rthaḥ /	Hence these three names express different meanings, but they designate the same object;
evaṃ /	in this same way.
cittacaitasāḥ / sāśrayā lambanākārāḥ saṃparayuktāśca /	The mind and its mental states "have a support," "have an object," "have an aspect," and are "associated.
eko 'rthaḥ /	These four different names, "have a support," etc. , designate the same object.
ta eva hi cittacaittāḥ sāśrayā ucyante indriyāśritatvāt /	'The mind and its mental states "have a support" because they rely on the organs;
sālambanā viṣayagrahaṇāt /	"have an object" or "a subject of consciousness," because they grasp their "sphere;
sākārāstasyaivālambanasya prakāraśa ākaraṇāt /	" "have an aspect," because they take form according to their object;
samprayuktāḥ samaṃ prayuktatvāt /	and are "associated," that is, similar and united, because they are similar to one another and are not separated from each other.
kena prakāreṇa samaṃ parayuktā ityāha	How are they samprayukta or associated, that is, "similar and united?
pañcadhā //	In five ways.
pañcabhiḥ samatāprākārairāśrayālambanākārakāladravyasamatābhiḥ /	The mind and its mental states are associated by reason of five equalities or identities, identity of support, of object, of aspect, of time, and equality in the number of dravyas.
keyaṃ samatā /	That is: the mental states and the mind are associated because they have the same support, the same object, and the same aspect; because they are simultaneous; and because, in this association, each type is represented by only one individual substance : in any given moment there can be only one mind produced;
yathaiva hyekaṃ cittamevaṃ caittā apyekaikā iti /	to this one, unique mind there is found associated one sensation, one idea, or one mental state of each type.
nirdiṣṭāścittacaittāḥ savistaraprabhedāḥ / viprayuktāstu saṃskārāḥ prāptyaprāptī sabhāgatā /	We have explained the mind and its mental states, in full, with their characteristics. What are the sanskaras not associated with the mind?
āsaṃjñikaṃ samāpattī jīvitaṃ lakṣaṇāni ca // nāmakāyādayaśceti	The dharmas "not associated with the mind" are prapti, aprapti, sabhagata, asanjnika, and two absorptions, life, characteristics, namakaya, etc. , and that which is of this type.
ime saṃskārā na cittena asaṃprayuktā naca rūpasvabhāvā iti cittaviprayuktāucyante / tatra tāvat	These dharmas are not associated with the mind; they are not of the nature of r%pa or physical matter; they are included within the samskatraskandha: they are called the cittaviptayukta samskaras, because they are disjoined from the mind, and because, being non-material, they resemble the mind.
praptirlābhaḥ samanvayaḥ /	Prapti is acquisition and possession.
dvividhā hi prāptiraprāptavihīnasya ca lābhaḥ pratilabdhena ca samanvāgamaḥ /	Prapti is of two types: acquisition of that which has not been. obtained or of that which had been lost;
viparyayādaprāptiriti siddham /	and possession of that which, having been obtained, has not been lost. Aprāpti is the opposite.
kasya punarime prāptyaprāptī / prāptyaprāptī svasaṃtāna patitānāṃ	There is prāpti and aprāpti of dharmas that belong to the person himself, when a conditioned dharma “falls into the personal series, there is prāprś ot aprāpti;
na parasaṃtānapatitānām / nahi parakīryaiḥ kaścitsamanvāgataḥ nāpyasaṃtatipatitānām /	of this dharma, but not if it falls into the series of another person, for no one possesses the dharmas of another;
na hyasatatvasaṃkhyātaiḥ kaścitsamanvāgataḥ / eṣa tāvat saṃskṛteṣu niyamaḥ /	nor if it does not fall into any series, for no one possesses the dharmas “which are not of a living being”.
asaṃskṛteṣu punaḥ prāptyaprāptī	As for unconditioned dharmas, there is prāpti of pratisaṁkhyiānirodha and apratisaṁkhyānirodha.
nirodhayoḥ //	And of the two extinctions.
sarvasattvā apratisaṃkhyānirodhena samanvāgatāḥ /	All beings possess the apratisṁkhyānirodha of the dharmas that do not arise without a cause.

sūtra vacanāt / “rājā bhikṣavaścakravarti saptabhī ratnaiḥ samanvāgata” iti vistaraḥ / vaśitvamatra samanvāgamaśabdenoktam /	the Cakravartin King possesses seven jewels. Now, among the jewels, there are the jewels of a wheel, a wife, etc. In this text, the expression "to possess" signifies "master of.
tasya teṣu ratneṣu vaśitvaṃ kāmacāra iti / atra vaśitvaṃ samanvāgamo 'nyatra punardravyāntaramiti /	One says that the Cakravartin King enjoys mastery over jewels, for they go as he wishes. But in the Sutra on the Possession of the Ten Dharmas of an Arhat, the word "possession" designates a thing in and of itself. If the word "possession" signifies "mastery" in the Cakravartisutra, how do you ascertain that, in another Sutra, this same word designates a supposed prapti;
kuta etat kaḥ punarevamayogaḥ /	a thing in and of itself?
ayam ayogaḥ yad asyā naiva svabhāvaḥ prajñāyate rūpaśabdādivad rāgadveṣādivad vā na cāpi kṛtyaṃ cakṣuḥśrotrādivat /	In fact, this prapti is not directly perceived, as is the case for color, sound, etc. , and as is the case for lust, anger, etc. One cannot conclude the existence of prapri by reason of its effects, as is the case for the sense organs, the organ of sight, etc. : for a similar effect is not perceived. Possession has an effect. It is the cause of the arising of the dharmas. This answer is unfortunate. You maintain. As for the conditioned dharmas, there is not now, in any given person, possession of the dharmas that he has not yet acquired, nor does he any longer possess the dharmas whose possession he has abandoned through his changing of his sphere of existence or through “detachment; ” the possession of the first has never existed, and the possession of the second has perished.
tasmāt dravyadharmāsaṃbhavādayogaḥ /	Hence how can these dharmas arise if the cause of their arising is prāpti?
utpattiheturdharmāṇāṃ prāptiriti cet /	The arising of these dharmas has for its cause a prāpti which arises at the same time as they do. An unfortunate answer! If the dharmas arise by virtue of prāpti, arising and the arising-of-arising have no use; the dharmas “that do not belong to living beings” do not arise;
asaṃskṛtasya na syāt / ye ca dharmā aprāptā ye ca tyaktā bhūmisaṃcāravaiarāgyatasteṣāṃ kathamutpattiḥ syāt /	and how does one explain the difference in the degree of defilement,—weak, medium, and strong defilement,—among persons who are ‘bound to all bonds’?
sahajaprāptihetukā cet / jātiridānīṃ kiṅkarī jātijātirvā / sakalabandhanānāṃ khalvapi mṛdumadhyādhimātrakleśotpattibhedo na syāt prāptyabhedāt /	: all in fact possess the same prāptis of all.
yato vā sa bhedastata evāstu tadutpattiḥ /	Would you say that this difference proceeds from causes distinct from prāp#s? We would answer that these causes are the only cause of weak, medium, or strong defilements;
tasmānnotpattihetuḥ prāptiḥ /	why would one want to assign it to prāpti?
kaścaivamāhotpattihetuḥ prāptiriti /	Who maintains that prāpti is the cause of the arising of dharmas? Such is not the role that we attribute to it. For us, prāpti is the cause that determines the state or condition of beings.
kiṃ tarhi / vyavasthā hetuḥ /	Let us explain.
asatyāṃ hi prāptau laukikamānasānāmāryapṛthagjanānāmāryā ime pṛthagjanā ima iti na syād vyavasthānam /	Let us suppose the non-existence of prāptÉ: what difference would there be between an Āryan at the moment in which he produces a mundane thought and a Pṛthagjana? Now the difference consists solely in that the Āryan, even when he has a worldly thought, is in possession of a certain number of pure dharmas.
prahīṇāprahīṇa kleśatāviśeṣādetat bhavitumarhati /	For us, there is this difference that the first has abandoned certain defilements, while the second has not yet abandoned thern. Without doubt;
etaccaiva kathaṃ bhaviṣyatyeṣāṃ prahīṇaḥ kleśa eṣāmaprahīṇa iti / praptau satyāmetatsidhyati tadvigamāvigamāt /	but if we suppose the nonexistence of prāpti, how can we say that a defilement is abandoṉed orTo us, the abandoning or the non-abandoning of a defilement consists of a certain condition of the person.
āśrayaviśeṣādetatsidhyati /	The personality of the Āryan is modified, becoming different from what it was through the power of the Path.
āśrayo hi sa āryāṇāṃ darśanabhāvanāmārgasāmarthyāttathā parāvṛtto bhavati yathā na punastatpraheyāṇāṃ kleśānāṃ prarohasamartho bhavati /	The defilement, once it has been destroyed through the force of the Path, cannot be manifested again.
ato 'gnidagdhavrīhivadavījībhūte āśraye kleśānāṃ prahīṇakleśa ityucyate /	Like seed which is burned by fire and which becomes different from what it once was, and is no longer capable of germinating, we say that the Āryan has abandoned the defilement, because his person no longer maintains the seeds capable of producing a defilement.
upahatavījabhāve vā laukikena mārgeṇa /	The worldly path does not definitively destroy the defilement;
viparyayādaprahīṇakleśaḥ /	it only damages it or disturbs it: one would say that a Pṛthagjana who is able to practice only the worldly path has abandoned the defilement when his person no longer contains even the seeds of defilement. Contrarily one says that a person has not abandoned defilement when the seeds are neither burnt nor damaged. One says that a person is in possession of the defilement when he has not abandoned them in the manner that we have just explained;
yaścāprahīṇastena samanvāgato yaḥ prahīṇastenā samanvāgata iti prajñapyate /	we say that he is in non-possession of the defilements when he has not abandoned it. “Possession” and “non-possession” are not things in and of themselves, but designations. This then concerns possession and non-possession of defilement.
kuśalā api dharmā dviprakārā ayatnabhāvino yatnabhāvinaśca ye ta ucyante utpattipratilambhikāḥ prāyogikāśceti / tatrāyatnabhāvibhirāśrayasya tadvījabhāvānupaghātāt samanvāgata upaghātādasamanvāgata ucyate samucchinnakuāśalamūlaḥ / tasya tūpaghāto mithyādṛṣṭyā veditavyaḥ /	But concerning the possession and non-possession of good dharmas, we must distinguish the innate good dharmas, which do not entail any effort, and the good dharmas that are obtained through effort or cultivation. We say that a person possesses the first when his person possesses intact the quality of being a seed of these good dharmas.
na tu khalu kuśalānāṃ dharmāṇāṃ vījabhāvasyātyantaṃ santatau samudghātaḥ /	When this quality is damaged, we say that the person does not possess the good dharmas. In fact, while the seeds of defilement can be destroyed completely and definitively, as is the case among the Āryans, good. Dharmas never have their roots definitively cut off, with the restriction that one says of a person who has cut off the roots of good through false views that he has only abandoned these roots, because the quality of being a seed of these roots, a quality that belongs to his person, has been damaged through false views.
yepunaryatnabhāvinastairutpannaistadutpattirvaśitvā vighātātsantateḥ samanvāgata ucyate /	We say that a person possesses the second—the good dharmas produced through effort, through hearing, reflection, and meditation—when, these dharmas having arisen, his capacity to produce them is not damaged.
tasmādvījamevātrānapoddhṛtamanupahatam paripṛṣṭaṃ ca vāśiatvakāle samanvāgamākhyāṃ tabhate nānyad dravyam /	Hence what we understand by “possession” or the “fact of being endowed with” is not a dharma constituting a separate thing in and of itself, namely the supposed of the Sarvāstivādins, but a certain condition of the person: the seeds of defilement have not been uprooted through the Path of the Saints; the seeds of defilement have not been damaged by means of the worldly path; the seeds of innate good have not been damaged through false views; and the seeds of good “obtained through effort”.
kiṃ punaridaṃ bījaṃ nāma /	are in good condition at the moment when one wants to produce this good, When the person is in such a condition, this is what we call "possession of defilements," etc. But what should we understand by "seeds"?
yannāmarūpaṃ phalotpattau samartha sākṣāt pāraṃparyeṇa vā / santatipariṇāmaviśeṣāt / ko 'yaṃ pariṇāmo nāma / santateranyathātvam / kā ceyaṃ santatiḥ/	By seeds we understand nāmarāpa, that is, the complex of the five skandhas, capable of generating a result, either immediately or mediately, by means of the pariṇāma-viśeṣa of its series.
hetuphalabhūtastraiyadhvikāḥ saṃskārāḥ /	The series is the saṁskāras of the past, the present and the future, in relation to causality, that constitutes an uninterrupted series. The pariṇāma, or the evolution of the series, is the modification of this series, the fact that this series arises differently from itself at each moment. The viśeṣa, or culminating point of this evolution, is the moment of this series that possesses the capacity of immediately producing a result.
yat tūkta “lobhena samanvāgato 'bhavyaścatvāri smṛtyupasthānāni bhāvayitumi“ti /	The Sūtra says, "He who is in possession of greed is not capable of producing the foundations of mindfulness.
tatrādhivāsanaṃ lobhasyāvinodanaṃ vā samanvāgamaḥ /	" In this text, we must understand by "possession" of greed the "consenting to greed," or "not rejecting greed. "Sūtra does not say that a person who has the seeds of greed in him is incapable of producing the foundations of mindfulness;
yāvaddhi tasyādhivāsako 'vinodako bhavati tāvat bhavyastāni bhāvayitum /	it says rather that active greed renders this person presently incapable of producing these spiritual exercises.
evamayaṃ samanvāgamaḥ sarvāthā prajñaptidharmo na tu dravyadharmaḥ /	In short, in whichever manner it is that we understand possession, either as “cause of the arising of the dharmas,” or as “origin of the condition of beings,” or as "“special state of the person,” or as “consenting to,ʼ possession appears to us, not as an entity, a thing in and of itself, but as a “dharma of designation.”
tasya ca pratiṣedho 'samanvāgama iti /	This same holds for non-possession, which is purely and simply the negation of possession.
dravyameva tu vaibhāṣikāḥ ubhayaṃ varṇayanti / kiṃ kāraṇam /	The Vaibhāṣikas say that prāpti and aprāpti are things in and of themselves.
eṣa hi naḥ siddhānta iti / sā kilaiṣā praptiḥ	Because this is our teaching.
traiyadhvikānāṃ trividhā	There is threefold prāpti of the dharmas of the three periods.
atītānāṃ dharmāṇāmatītā 'pi prāptirastyanāgatyā 'pi pratyutpannā 'pi / evamanāgataparatyutpannānāṃ pratyekaṃ trividhā /	Past dharmas can be the object of a threefold prāpti, past, present, and future. The same for present and future dharmas.
ṣubhādīnāṃ ṣubhādikā / kuśalākuśalāvyākṛtānāṃ kuāśalākuśalāvyākṛtaiva yathākramaṃ prāptiḥ /	There is good prāpti, etc. , of good dharmas, etc. The prāpti of good, bad, or neutral dharmas is, respectively, good, bad, or neutral.
svadhātukā tadāptānāṃ ye dharmāstaddhātvāptāsteṣāṃ svadhātukā prāptiḥ /	The prāptis of the dharmas belonging to the spheres of existence are of their spheres. The dharmas belonging to the spheres of existence are impure dharmas.
kāmarūpārūpyāvacarāṇāṃ kāmarūpārūpyāvacarī yathākramam /	The prāpii of a dharma in Kāmadhātu is, itself, in Kāmadhātu; and thus following.
anāptā nāṃ caturvidhā //	There is fourfold prāpti of the āharmas that do not belong to the spheres of existence.
anāsravāṇāṃ dharmāṇāṃ caturvidhā praptiḥ / samāsena traidhātukī cānāsravā ca /	In general, the prāpti of these dharmas—the pure dharmas—is fourfold: it belongs to the three spheres, and it is pure. But there are distinctions: The prāpti of apratisaṁkhyānirodha is of the sphere to which the person who obtains it belongs.
tatrāpraptiṃsaṃṅkhyānirodhasya traidhātukī pratisaṃkhyānirodhasya rūpārūpyāvacarī cānāsravā ca /	The prāpti of pratisaṁkhyānôirodha is of Rāpadhātu, of Ārūpyadhatu, and pure.
mārgasatyasyānāsravaiva / seyaṃ samasya caturvidhā bhavati /	The prāpti of the Path is Śaikṣa;
śaikṣāṇāṃ dharmāṇāṃ śaikṣaiva prāptiḥ akṣaikṣāṇāmaśaikṣānāśaikṣāṇāntubhedaḥ / sa nirdiśyate	the prāpti of the Aśaikṣa ḍharmas is Aśaikṣa.
tridhā naśaikṣā 'śaikṣāṇāṃ	But there is Threefold prāpti of the dharmar which are neither Śaikṣa nor Aśaikṣa.
naivaśaikṣānāśaikṣā dharmā ucyante sāsravā dharmā asaṃskāṛtaṃ ca /	These dharmas—the naivaśaikṣanāśaikṣas—are the impure dharmas and the unconditioned dharmas; they are called this becauseThey differ from the dharmas of the Śaikṣa and from the dharmas of the Aśaikṣa.
teṣāṃ śaikṣādibhedena trividhā prāptiḥ /	In general, the prāpti of these dharmas is threefold. Their distinctions are: The prāpti of the impure dharmas is neither-śaikṣa-nor Aśaikṣa.
sāsravāṇāṃ tāvat naivaśaikṣānāśaikṣī prāptiḥ /	In this same way the prāpti of apratisaṁkhyānirodha and the prāpti of pratisaṁkhyānirodha are obtained by a non-Āryaṉ. The prāpti of pratisaṁkhyānirodha is Śaikṣa when this vérodha is obtained through the path of the Śaikṣas;
apratisaṃkhyānirodhasya ca pratisaṃkhyānirodhasya cānāryeṇa praptasya / tasyaiva śaikṣeṇa mārgeṇa praptasya śaikṣī aśaikṣeṇāśaikṣī /	it is Aśaikṣa when this nirodha is obtained through the path of the Aśaikṣas.
darśanabhāvanāheyānāṃ yathākramaṃ darāśanabhāvanāheyaiva parāptiḥ / aheyānāṃ tu bhedaḥ /	The prāpti of the dharmas to be abandoned either through Seeing, or through Meditation, is destroyed, respectively, either through Seeing or through Meditation;
sa nirdiśyate	it belongs then, from the point of view of abandoning them, to the category of these dharmas.
aheyānāṃ dvidhā matā /	As for the dharmas which should not be abandoned, their prāpti presents difficulties: There is twofold prāptś of the ḍharmas that should not be abandoṉed.

yaduktaṃ “traiyadhvikānāṃ trividhe” ti tasyotsargasyāyamapavādaḥ	We have established the general principal that the dharmas of the three periods are susceptible of a threefold prāpri. We must be more precise.
avyākṛtāptiḥ sahajā	The prāpti of a neutral dharma is simultaneous to it.
anivṛtāvyākṛtānāṃ sahajaiva prāptirnāgrajā na paścātkālajā /	The prāpti of an undefiled-neutral dharma is simultaneous to this dharma: one possesses it when it is present, not when it is past or future.
durbalatvāt / tenateṣāmatītānāmatītaiva yāvat pratyutpannānāṃ pratyutpannaiva / kiṃ sarvasyaivānivṛtāvyākṛtasya /	When it is past, the prāpti is past, and when it is future, the prāpti is future: this by reason of the weakness of this dharma.
na sarvasya / abhijñānairmāṇikādṛte // dve abhijñe avyākṛte nirmāṇacittaṃ ca varjayitvā /	With the exception of the two supernormal faculties and apparition, This rule does not apply to all undefiled-neutral dharmas.
teṣāṃ hi balavattvāt prayogaviśeṣaniṣpatteḥ pūrva paścāt sahajā prāptiḥ / śailpasthānikasyāpi kasyacidīryāpathikasyā tyarthamabhyastasyecchanti / kimanivṛtāvyākṛtasyaiva sahajā praptirityāha	The supernormal faculties of seeing and hearing and the mind capable of creating apparitional beings are strong, for they are realized through a special. Certain Masters maintain that the undefiled-neutral dharmas of craftsmanship and of attitude, when they have been the object of an intense practice, are also possessed in the past and future. The same for the prāpti of defiled rāpa. The prāpti of defiled-neutral /%pa is only simultaneous to this rūpa.
nivṛtasya ca rūpasya	This rūpa is bodily action and vocal action resulting from a defiled-neutral mind.
nivṛtāvyākṛtasyāpi vijñaptirūpasya saharjaiva prāptiradhimātreṇāpyavijñaptyanutthāpanādaurbalyasiddheḥ /	This action, even though produced by a strong mind, is incapable, as is the mind itself, of creating avijñapti, hence it is weak. Thus one possesses it in the present, but not in the past or the future.
yathā 'vyākṛtānāṃ dharmāṇāmayaṃ praptibhedaḥ kimevaṃ kuśalākuśalānāmapikaścit prāptibhedo 'sti / astītyāha / kāme rūpasya nāgrajā /	Is the tritemporal character of the prāpti of the good and the bad dharmas subject to any restriction, as is the case with the prāpt of the neutral dharmas?
kāmāvacarasya vijñaptyavijñaptirūpasyāgrajā praptiḥ sarvathā nāsti /	The prāpti of the rūpa of Kāmadhātu is not previous to this rpa. This r%pa, good or bad, for example the prātérnokéṣa-sarvara (iv.
sahajā cāsti paścātkālajā ca /	19 and following), is not possessed previous to its being produced.
kimaprāpterapi prāptivatprakārabhedaḥ / netyāha / kiṃ tarhi /	TheCan non-possession be, like prāpti, good, bad, or neutral?
akliṣṭāvyākṛtā 'prāptiḥ	Aprāpti is undefiled-neutral.
aprāptiranivṛtāvyākṛtaiva sarvā / adhvabhedena punaḥ	Aprāpti īs atways anivṛtāvyākr̥ta.
sā 'tītājātayostridhā // pratyutpannasya nāratyaprāptiḥ pratyutpannā /	Aprāpti of the dharmas of the past or the future is threefold.
atītānāgatayostu traiyadhvikī / kāmādyāptāmalānāṃ ca	Aprāpti of past or future dharmas can be past, present, or future. But one necessarily possesses the present dharmas: hence the aprāpti of present dharmas can be only past or future.
trividheti varttate /	Aprāpti of the dharmas forming part of the spheres of existence, and of the immaculate dharmas, is threefold.
kāmāptānāṃ kāmarūpārūpyāvacarī / evaṃ rūpārūpyāptānāmanāsravāṇāṃ ca nāstyanāsravā kācidaprāptiḥ /	Aprāpti of the dharmas of the sphere of Kamadhātu belong either to Kāmadhātu, Rūpadhātu, or Ārūpyadhātu accordingly as the person endowed with this aprāptiÉ belongs to such a sphere of existence. The same for the aprāpti of pure dharmas. In fact, aprāpti is never pure. According to the School, a Prṛthagjana is a petson who has not acquired the Path. Now the state of Pṛthagjana is not pure; hence their nonpossession is not pure.
tathāhi / mārgasyāprāptiriṣyate /	Let us examine this definition.
pṛthagjanatvam “pṛthagjanatvaṃ katamat / āryadharmāṇāmalābha” iti śāstrapāṭhaḥ / alābhaśca nāmāprāptiḥ / naca pṛthagjanatvamanāsravaṃ bhavitumarhati /	When the Śāstra says that the state of Prthagjana is the non-possession of the dharmas of the Āryans, which dharmas of the Āryans does it mean?
katameṣāmāryadharmāṇāmalābhaḥ /	The dharmas beginning with duḥkhe dharmajñānakṣáānti and including the whole pure path or the Path of the Aryans.
sarveṣāmaviśeṣavacanāt / sa tu yo vinā lābhenālābhaḥ / anyathā hi cuddho 'pi śrāvakapratyekabuddhagotrakai rasamanvāgamādanāryaḥ syāt / evaśabdastarhi paṭhitavyaḥ /	The Śāstra means all these dharmas, since it does not specify any.
na paṭhitavyaḥ /	Be careful! To believe you, a person in possession of duḥkhe kṣāṅṁti would be a Pr̥thagjana if he did not possess all of the other Āryan dharmas. The Śāstra means the non-possession that is not accompanied by possession: the person of whom you speak, although not possessing the other dharmas of the Āryans, is not a Pr̥thagjana because the non-possession of these other dharrmas is accompanied by the possession of the kgāṇt; This is quite evident, for, in the contrary interpretation, the Buddha the Blessed Oné, notVety well. But then the Śāstra would say “The state of Prthagjana is the absolute non-possession of the Āryaṉ dharmas” and not 'the non-possession.”
ekapadānyapi hyavadhāraṇāni bhavanti / tadyathā abbhakṣo vāyubhakṣa iti /	The Śāstra expresses itself very well, for the ekapadas permit a restrictive sense and the particle eva is not necessary: for example abbhakṣa signifies “that which lives solely on watet,” and vāyubhakṣa, “that which lives solely on wind.”
duḥkhe dharmajñānakṣāntitatsahabhuvāmalābha ityapare / na ca tadyogā danāryatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	According to another opinion, the state of Prthagjana is the non-possession of the first stage of the Path of Seeing, duḥkhe ḍharmajñānakṣēānti and its concomitant dharmas. In this hypothesis, at the sixteenth moment, the saint will be a Prṛthagjana and not an Āryan, for at this moment, the initial kṣāt;
tadalābhasyātyantaṃ hatatvāt /	is lost. No, for the non-possession of the kṣānri which constitutes the state of Pṭthagjana has been absolutely destroyed in the first stage.
te tarhi trigotrā iti katameṣāmalābhaḥ /	The éṣānti in question is threefold: of the family of. We mean to speak of three types of &ṣáānti.
sarveṣām /	Be careful! The Buddha, not possessing the three types of kṣānti, would then be a Pṛthagjana! We intend to speak of the non-possession of the kṛāni which is not accompanied by possession, and thus following, as above, to the example “that which lives solely on water,” “that which lives solely on wind.
evaṃ tarhi sa eva doṣaḥ / punaḥ sa eva parihāraḥ /	” Hence the effort attempted in order to avoid the objection: “Be careful! To believe you, a person in possession of duhkhe dharmajñānakṣānti would be a Prṛthagjana.
yatnastarhi vyarthaḥ /	” is in vain.
evaṃ tu sādhu yathā sautrāntikānām / kathaṃ ca sautrāntikānām /	The best explanation is that of the Sautrāntikas.
“anutpannāryadharmasantatiḥ pṛthagjanatvami“ti /	To them, the state of Pr̥thagjana is a series in which the dbarmas of the Āryans have not arisen.
atheyamaprāptiḥ kathaṃ vihīyate / yasya yā dharmasya prāptirasau	How does non-possession perish?
tatprāptibhusaṃcārād vihīyate //	It is abandoned through acquisition, and through passing to another stage.
yathā tāvadāryamārgasyālābhaḥ pṛthagjanatvaṃ tasya lābhāttadvihīyate bhūmisaṃcārācca /	For example, the non-possession of the Path, which constitutes the.
evamanyeṣāmapi yojyam /	The same holds for the non-possession of the other dharmas.
vihīyata iti tasyā aprāpteraprāptirutpadyate prāptiśchidyate /	Non-possession is abandoned when one produces the non-possession of non-possession, that is to say, when, changing one’s stage of existence, one ceases to possess the state of Prthagjana; and when the possession of non-possession is cut off, that is to say, when, acquiring the Path, one cuts off the state of Prthagjana.
kiṃ punaraprāptiprāptyorapi prāptyaprāptī bhavataḥ /	Does this mean that there is possession of possession and non-possession, and that there is non-possession of possession and nonpossession? Yes.
ubhayorapyubhayaṃ bhavtītyāhuḥ /	There is possession and non-possession of possession and non-possession, which is called “secondary possession”, or “secondary non-possession. ” One then distinguishes between laprāti aṇḍ anuprāpti ot prāptiprāpti.
nanu caivamanavasthā prasaṅgaḥ praptīnām / nānavasthāprasaṅgaḥ /	Doesn't this doctrine lead to infinite progression? No, for one possesses possession through the fact of possession of possession and vice versa.
parasparasamanvāgamāt /	There is possession of the oné through the.
ātmanā tṛtīyo hi dharma utpadyate /	When a certain dharmua is produced in a given person, three dbarmar arise together, namely: this dharma itself, which is called the mladharma;
sa ca dharmastasya prāptiḥ prāptiprāptiśca /	the prāpti of this ṁmladharma; and the prāpti of this prāpri.
tatra prāptyutpādāttena dharmeṇa samanvāgato bhavati prāptiprāptyā ca /	The person in question possesses the rn%ūladharma and the prāpti of the prāpti by the fact of the arising of the prāprÉ;
prāptiprāptyutpādāt punaḥ prāptyaiva samanvāgato bhavatyato nānavsthā /	he possesses this prāpts by the fact of the arising of the prāpri. Hence there is no infinite progression.
evaṃ ca kṛtva ātmanā tṛtīyasya dharmasya kuśalasya kliṣṭasya kliṣṭasya vā dvitīye kṣaṇe tisraḥ prāptayo jāyante /	When a good or a defiled dharma arises, at this very moment three dharmas aṟise together, inclusive of this good or defiled dharṇa, namely: the mūladharma, its prāpti, and the prāpti of this prāp which is the prāpti of the prāptiprāpti of the first moment, plus three anuprāptis through the fact that one is in possession of the three aforementioned prāptis.
tāsāṃ ca punastisro 'nuprāptaya iti ṣaḍ bhavanti / tṛtīye kṣaṇe prathamadvitīyakṣaṇotpannānāṃ dravyāṇāṃ nava prāptayaḥ sārdhamanuprāptibhirityaṣṭādāśa bhavanti /	In this third moment eighteen dharmas arise together, namely nine prāptis: the prāptis of the three dharmas produced in the first moment, prāptis of the sīx dharmas ptoduced in the second momenr.
evamuttarottaravāṛddhiprasaṇṅgenaitāḥ praptayo visarpantyaḥ sarveṣāmatītānāgatānāṃ	Thus the prāptás continue increasing in number from moment to moment.
kleśopakleśakṣaṇānāmupapattilābhikānāṃ ca kuśalakṣaṇānāṃ saṃprayoga sahabhuvāmanādyantasaṃsāraparyāpannānāmanantā	The prāpśy of present and future defilements and of innate good dharmas with the dharmas that are associated and co-existent with them throughout beginningless and endless transmigration, arise from moment to moment, in an infinite number.
ekasya prāṇinaḥ kṣaṇe kṣaṇe upajāyante ityanantadravyāḥ pratisantānamātmabhāvakṣaṇāḥ	If one considers the series of one single being in the course of transmigration, those prāpts which arise at each moment are infinite in number.
sattvānāṃ bhavanti / atyutsavo vatāyaṃ prāptīnāṃ varttate /	Considering all beings together, they are without measure, and without limit.
kevalaṃ tu apratighātinyo yato 'vakāśamākāśe labhante /	Happily, they possess a great quality: they are non-material, and give way one to the other.
itarathā hyākāśe 'pyava kāśo na syāt dvitīyasya prāṇinaḥ //	If they were material, there could not be found enough room in the universe for the prāptis of one single being, and even less for the prāptis of two beings!
atha keyaṃ sabhāgatā /	What is "genre" or sameness of class designation?
sabhāgatā sattvasāmyaṃ	Sabhāgatā is that which causes resemblance between living.
sabhāgatā nāma dravyam /	There exists an entity called sabhāgatā, a dharma by virtue of which living beings, as well as the dharmas “that fall into the series of living beings”, have resemblance between them.
sattvānāṃ sākṛśyaṃ nikāyasa bhāga ityasyāḥ śāstre saṃjñā /	The Śāstra designates this entity by the name of nōkāyasabhāga: the author uses the term sabhāgatā for metric reasons.

The second has numerous subdivisions: each of these subdivisions is found only in certain beings. Living beings are differentiated according to their spheres of existence, the different stages of these spheres, their realm of rebirth, their wombs, their caste, their sex, the state of Upāsaka, Bhikṣu, Śaiksa, or Arhat, etc. This holds as well for sabhāgatās, by virtue of which each living being of a certain species resembles living beings of this same species.
punaḥ skndhāyatanadhātutaḥ yadi satvasabhāgatā dravyamaviśiṣtaṃ na syāt anyonyaviśeṣabhinneṣu sattveṣu sattvasttva ityabhedena buddhirna syāt prajñaptiśca / evaṃ skandhādi buddhiprajñaptayyo 'pi yojyāḥ /	In the absence of a separate entity, namely sabhāgatā, how does one explain general ideas and expressions, such as “living beings,” etc. , applied to some beings that differ one from another? In this same way, it is solely by reason of dharmasabhāgatā that the ideas and expressions, “skundha,” “dhātus,” etc. , are justified.
syāccyavetopapadyeta na ca sattvasabhāgatāṃ vijahyānna ca pratilabheteti /	Do we conclude that one transmigrates, that one dies and is born without abandoning and without taking up a certain satṭvasabhāgatā?
catuṣkoṭikaḥ / prathamā koṭiḥ yataścyavate tatraivopapadyamānaḥ /	There are four alternatives; to die in a place and be reborn in the same place: the sśabhāgatā remains the same, regardless of transmigratioṉ;
dvitīyā niyāmamavkrāman / sa hi pṛthagjanasabhāgatāṃ vijahyādāryasabhāgatāṃ pratilabhate / tṛtīyā gatisaṃcārāt / caturthyetānākārān sthāpayitvā / yadi pṛthagjanasabhāgatā nāma dravyamasti kiṃ punaḥ pṛthagjanatvena /	to enter into one’s predetermined realm of rebirth: without there being transmigration, there is yet the abandoning of the sabhāgaiā of the Pṛthagjanas and the acqnisition of the sabhāgatā of.

naiva ca lokaḥ sabhāgatāṃ paśyatyarūpiṇītvāt nacaināṃ prajñayā paricchinatti pratipadyate ca satvānāṃ jātyabhedamiti satyā api tasyāḥ kathaṃ tatra vyāpāraḥ /	they do not infer the existence of the sabhagata through an operation of the intelligence, for rabhagata does not exercise any action by which one could know it: although people do not know anything of sattuasabhagata they recognize the non-difference of the species of beings. Hence, what.
apicāsattvasabhāgatā 'pi kiṃ neṣyate /	Would be the use in supposing that a sabhāgatā exists?

vaiśeṣikāścaivaṃ dyotitā bhavanti / teṣāmapi hyeṣa siddhāntaḥ /	The Šarvāstivādins are the proponents of the doctrine of the Vaiśeṣikas.

atha kimidamāsaṃjñikaṃ nāma /	What is non-consciousness?
āsaṃjñikamasaṃjñiṣu / nirodhaścittacaittānāṃ	Non-consciousness is that which, among the Nonconscious Ones, arrests the mind and its mental states.

kiṃ punastenaiva kadāciat saṃśino bhavanti /	Are the Non-Conscious Ones called this because they are always non-conscious, or are they sometimes conscious?
bhavantyupapattikāle cyutikāle ca /	They are conscious at birth and at death; they are called non-conscious because their consciousness is suspended for a very long time.

As it says in the Sūtra “When they produce consciousness again, they die, like a person awakening. In fact, the force of aśaṁjñisamāpatti, by which these beings are born among the NonConscious Ones, is exhausted;

tāṃ tu niḥsaraṇasaṃjñā pūrvakeṇa / sā khalvapi caturthadhyānabhūmikā / iyaṃ tu	One cultivates the non-conscious absoxption because one regards non-consciousness as being deliverance.

naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatanabhūmikaiva / sā ceyaṃ	It belongs to the sphere of Bhavāgra, that is, one penetrates it upon leaving naivasaṁjñānāsaṁmjñāyatana absorption, whereas the non-conscious absorption belongs to the spbere of the Fourth Dhyāṇa.

yadīha pariniarvāyāt tasyā hi bhavāgre catuḥskandhako vipākaḥ / sā ceyamekāntena	Its retribution is also unnecessary, for the ascetic who has practiced it can obtain Nirvāṇa in the present existence. This absorption produces the four séandhas of Bhavāgra, ie. , an existence in Bhavāgra.
āryasya	It is produced only by Āryans, not by Pṛthagjanas.

āpyā prayogataḥ //	It is obtained through effort. Although obtained by the Āryans, it is not obtained merely through the fact of detachment.
prayogalabhyaiveyam /	It is only realized through effort.
na cātītā labhyate nāpyanāgata bhāvyate / cittabalena tadbhāvanāt / kiṃ bhagavato 'pi parāyogikī /	One does not possess this absorption in the past or in the future; this point has been explained in the matter of the non-conscious absoṟptioṅn.
netyāha / bodhilabhyā muneḥ	In that which concerns the Muni, it is obtained through Bodhi itself.
kṣayajñānasamanaṃ kālaṃ buddhā bhagavanta enāṃ labhante nāsti kiñcidbuddhānāṃ prāyogikaṃ nāma /	The Buddha obtains the absorption of extinction at the moment when he becomes a Buddha, that is, at the moment of kṣayajñāna. No quality of the Buddha is obtained through effort;
icchāmātrapratibaddho hi teṣāṃ sarvaguṇasaṃpātsaṃmukhībhāvaḥ / tasmādeṣāṃ sarvavairāgyalābhikam /	all of his qualities are acquired through the simple fact of detachment: as soon asHe desires it, the mass of qualities arise at will.
kathaṃ khalvi dānīmanutpāditāyāṃ nirodhasamāpattau kṣayajñānakāle bhagavānubhayotobhāgavimuktaḥ sidhyati /	How is it that the Blessed One, without having formerly produced this absorption, would become, at the moment of Bodhi, “twofold delivered,” that is, delivered from the obstacles of the defilements and delivered from the obstacles to absorption?
sidhyatyutpāditāyāmiva tasyāṃ vaśitvāt prāgeva tāṃ bodhisattvaḥ śaikṣyāvasthāyāmutpādayatīti pāścattyāḥ /	He becomes “twofold delivered” exactly as if he had previously produced this absorption, for he possesses the power of realizing this absorption whenever he wishes. The Masters of the West maintain that the Bodhisattva first produced this absorption in the state of Śaikṣa, and then obtained Bodhi.
atha kasmādevaṃ neṣyate /	Why do we not adopt this opinion?
evaṃ ca sthaviropaguptasyāpīdaṃ netrīpadaṃ prāmāṇikaṃ bhaviṣyati / “nirodhasamāpattimutpādya kṣayajñānamutpādayatīti vaktavyaṃ tathāgata“iti /	This would be to follow the Netrīpadasūs:ra of the Sthavira Upagupta, which says, “One who, after having produced the absorption of extinction, produces éṣayajñāna, should be called a Tathāgata.
na prāk	” But not previously.
nahi pūrvaṃ tasyā utapādanaṃ yujyata iti kāśmīrakāḥ /	The Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr deny that the Bodhisattva produces the absorption of extinction before producing kṣayajñāna.
kiṃ kāraṇam / catustriṃśatkṣaṇāptitaḥ / catusriṃśatā kila cittakṣaṇairbodhisattvo bodhimanuprāptaḥ /	For the Muṇi conquers Bodhi in thirty-four moments.

The eighteenth moment is kṣayajñāna. These thirty-four moments suffice, for, before entering into the “comprehension of the Truths,” the Bodhisattva, still a Prṛthagjana, detaches himself through the worldly path from all spheres, with the exception of Bhavāgra. The eighteen moments form a path during the course of which the Saint does not produce a mind of a different nature, that is, a worldly, impure mind, for example the mind entering the absorption of extinction.
ata etasminnantare visabhāgacittāsaṃbhavānnirodhasamāpatterayoga iti /	Hence the Bodhisattva, in the stage of Śaikṣa, that īs, before becoming an Arhat, enters the comprehension of the Truths and the eighteenth moment of the abandoning of Bhavāgra, but he does not produce the absorption of extinction.
kiṃ punaḥ syādyadi visabhāgacittamantarā saṃmukhīkkuryāt /	The Foreigners say, "What harm is there in the Bodhisattva producing this impure mind?
vyutthānāśayaḥ syādavyutthānāśayāśca bodhisattvāḥ /	" In this hypothesis, the Bodhisattva oversteps his resolution, now the Bodhisattva does not overstep his resolution.
satyamavyutthānāśayā natu āsrava mārgāvyutthānāt /	This is true, he does not overstep his resolution; but this does not mean that he would not overstep the Pure Path in producing an impure mind.
kathaṃ tarhi “na tāvat bhetsyāmi paryaṅkamaprāpte āsravakṣaya” iti /	How, in this hypothesis, would he not overstep his resolution? He has taken upon himself the resolution, "I shall not leave this sitting position before I obtain the destruction of all the defilements.
asyāśayasyāvyutthānā dekāyana eva sarvārthaparisamāpteriti bahirdeśakāḥ / pūrvameva tu varṇayanti kāśmīrāḥ /	" Now he does not overstep this resolution, for it is in one "sitting" that he realizes his goal.
yadyapyanayoḥ samāpattyorbahuprakāro viśeṣaḥ /	Although the two absorptions, the non-conscious absorption and the absorption of extinction, present many differences, they have this in common.
kāmarūpāśraye bhūte	But these two absorptions take place in persons in Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu.
ubhe api tvete asaṃjñinirodhasamāpattī kāmadhātau rūpadhātau cotpatsyete /	To deny that the non-conscious absorption is produced in Rūpadhātu is to contradict the Mūlaśāstra, which says, "There is an.

ata ubhe apyete kāmarūpāśraye / tatrāpi tvayaṃ viśeṣaḥ /	From this text it results that the two absoṟptions are cultivated by beings of Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu.
nirodhākhyādito nṛṣu //	There is however this difference between the two absorptions: The absorption of extinction is, foṛ the first time, among humans. A person who has never produced the non-conscious absorption can produce this absorption either in Kāmadhātu or in Rūpadhātu;
nirodhasamāpattiḥ prathamato manuṣyepūtpādyate paścādrūpadhātau parihīṇapūrvaiḥ /	but it is necessary to be a human in order to produce the absoṟption of extinction for the first time. A humen, an Āryan, who has produced this absorption can fall from it, and losing possession of it, can be reborṉ in Rūpadhātu and produce this absorption anew.
kimato 'pyasti parihāṇiḥ / astītyāha /	But the question is raised whether one can fall from the absorption.
anyathā hi ndāyi sūtraṃ virudhyeta / “ihāyuṣmanto bhikṣuḥ śīlasaṃpannaśca bhavati samādhisaṃpannaśca prajñāsaṃpannaśca /	Yes, to deny falling is to contradict the Udāyi-sātra which says, "Brothers, a Bhikṣu is endowed with morality, with absorption, and with discernment.
so 'bhīkṣṇaṃ saṃjñāvedayita nirodhaṃ samāpadyate ca vyuttiṣṭhate cāsti caitat sthānamiti	It is possible for him to enter many times into the absorption of extinction and leave it.
yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti sa na haiva dṛṣṭa eva dharme pratipattye vājñāmārāgayati nāpi	If, in this life, he does not attain āpñṁ nor attain it at the moment of his death;
maraṇakālasamaye bhedācca kāyasyātikramya devān kavaḍīkārāhāra bhakṣānanyatarasmin divye manomaye kāya upapadyate /	but after the destruction of his body, going beyond the gods of gross eating, he is reborn in a heavenly mental body;
sa tatropapanno 'bhīkṣṇaṃ saṃjñāveditanirodhaṃ samāpadyate ca vyuttiṣṭahate cāsti caitat sthānamiti yathābhūtaṃ prajānātī“ti /	and thus reborn it is possible for him to then enter many times into the absorption of extinction and leave it. " This text shows in fact that one can fall from nrodhasamāpatti.
atra hi divyo manomayaḥ kāyo rūpāvacara ukto bhagavatā /	On the one hand the Buddha would have us understand that the mental body that Śāriputra speaks of belongs to Rūpadhātu.
iyaṃ ca samāpattirbhāvāgrikī / tatkathamaparihīṇasya tallābhino rūpadhātau syādupapattiḥ /	On the other hand, the absorption of extinction is of the realm of Bhavāgra, the highest state of Ārūpyadhātu. If a Bhikṣu who possesses it does not fall from it, and if he does not lose it, he will not be able to repeat his.
caturthadhyānabhūmikāmapi nirodhasabhāpatiṃ nikāyāntarīyā icchanti / teṣāṃ vināpi parihāṇyā sidhyatyetat /	According to another school, the absorption of extinction also belongs to the Fourth Dhyāna and is not subject to falling.
etadeva tu na sidhyati / caturthadhyānabhūmikā 'pyasāvastīti / kiṃ kāraṇam /	This opinion is not correct.
“navānupūrvasamāpattaya” iti sūtre vacanāt /	This absorption does not belong to the Fourth Dhyāna, for the Sūtra teaches that one acquires nine absorptions one after the other.
yadyeṣa niyamaḥ kathaṃ vyutkrāntasamāpattayo bhavanti /	How then do you explain the vyukrāntaka absorption in which the ascetic passes over different stages of absorption?
prāthamakalpikaṃ pratyeṣa niyamaḥ /	The rule of the successive production of the absorptions concerns the beginner.
praptaprakāmavāśitvāstu santo vilaṅghyāpi samāpadyante /	He who has acquired mastery passes over the absorptions at will.
evamanayoḥ samāpattyorbhūmito 'pi viśeṣaḥ / caturthadhyānatayā 'grābhūmikatvāt /	There are differences between these two absorptions: from the point of view of their spheres, the first is of the Fourth Dhyāṇna, the second of Bhavāgra;
prayogato 'pi niḥsaraṇavihārasaṃjñāpūrvakamanasikāraprayogāt / saṃtānato 'pi pṛthagjanāryasaṃtānatvāt / phalato 'pyāsaṃjñikabhavāgraphalatvāt / vedanīyato 'pi niyatāniyatopapadyobhayathāvedanīyatvāt /	from the point of view of their antecedents or preparations, the first proceeds from the idea of deliverance falsely identified with non-consciousness, the second from the idea of stillness;
prathamotpādanato 'pi dvidhātumanuṣyotpādanāt /	from the point of view of the person, the first is produced in a Prthagjana, the second in an Āryam.
kasmāt punarete cittatacaittanirodhasvabhāve satyāvasaṃjñisamāpattiḥ saṃjñāveditanirodhasamāpattiścocyate /	The characteristic common to these two absorptions is the arresting of the mind and its mental states. Why is the first called "absorption free from ideas" and the second "absorption of extinction of ideas and sensations"?
tatprātikūlyena tatsamāpattiprayogāt /	Because the preparation from the first merely opposes ideas, whereas preparation for the second opposes both ideas and sensations.
vedanādijñāne 'pi paracittajñānavacanavat /	In the same way paracitajñāna, "knowledge of the mind of another," bears on the mental states of someone else: it receives this restrictive name because its preparation alludes only to the mind of another.
kathamidānīṃ bahukālaṃ niruddhāccittāt punarapi cittaṃ jāyate /	In the two absorptions, the mind is interrupted for a long time. How, upon coming out of this absorption, can a new mind be born from a mind destroyed for a long time?
atītasyāpyastitvāt iṣyate vaibhāṣikaiḥ samanantarapratyayatvam / apare punarāhuḥ /	The Vaibhāṣikas find no difficulty in this: past dharas exist. Consequently the mind previous to this absorption, the mind-in-absorption or "the mind of entry into the absorption" is the similar and immediate cause of the mind after the absorption or the "mind-of-leaving".
kathaṃ tāvad rūpopapannānāṃ ciraniruddhe 'pi rūpe punarapi rūpaṃ jāyate / cittād eva hi taj jāyate na rūpāt /	When a person is born in Ārūpyadhātu, or matter is cut off for a long period of time: if this person is then reborn in Kāmadhātu or in Rūpadbātu, his new riūpa does not proceed from the series of %pa previously interrupted for a long time, but rather, from the mind.
evaṃ cittam apy asmād eva sendriyāt kāyāj jāyate na cittāt /	In the same way, the mind of leaving the absorption does not have for its cause the. It is born from “@ body possessing organs”.
anyonyabījakaṃ hy etadubhayaṃ yaduta cittaṃ ca sendriyaśca kāya iti pūrvācāryāḥ /	This is why the Ancient Masters said, “Two dharmas are the seed one of the other: these two dharmas are a mind and a body possessing organs.”
bhadantavasumitrastvāha paripṛcchāyāṃ “yasyācittikā nirodhasamāpattistasyaiṣa doṣo mama tu sacittikā samāpattiri“ti /  ti /	Vasurnitra says in the treatise entitled Paripṛcchā: “This difficulty, ie. , ‘How is the mind reborn after absorption? ’, interests those who consider the absorption of extinction as free from mind. But I maintain that this absorption is accompanied by a subtle mind. The difficulty does not exist for me.”
bhadantaghoṣaka āha tadidaṃ nopapadyate /	The Bhadanta Ghoṣaka regards this opinion as wrong.
“sati hi vijñāne trayāṇāṃ saṃnipātaḥ sparśaḥ /	In fact, if any consciousness resides in this absorption, there would be contact through the coming together of the three, consciousness, organ, and object;
sparśapratyayā ca vedanā saṃjñā cetan''etyuktaṃ bhagavatā /	by reason of contact, there would be sensation and ideas. As the Blessed One teaches, “By reason of the mental organ and the dharmas, mental consciousness arises;
ataḥ saṃjñāvedanayorapyatra nirodho na syāt /	by the coming together of these three, there is contact, sensation, ideas, and volition arise at the same time.”
athāpi syāt /	Hence, if one. admits that the mind continues to exist in this absorption, sensation and ideas will not be arrested in it. Now this absorption is called the extinction of sensation and ideas.
yathā vedanāpratyayā tṛṣṇe“tyuktam / satyāmapi tu vedanāyāmarhato na tṛṣṇotpattirevaṃ satyapi sparśe vedannādayo na syuriti / tasyāviśeṣitatvāt /	The Sūtra says, "By reason of sensation, there is thirst," and yet, although Arhats experience sensation, thirst does not arise in them. The same here: every contact is not a cause of seṇsation.
avidyāsaṃsparśajaṃ hi veditaṃ pratītyotpannā tṛṣṇetyuktaṃ natu vedanotpattau sparśo viśeṣita ityasamānametat /	This reasoning is not conclusive. The Sūtra, in fact, specifies, "Thirst arises by reason of sensation born of contact which is accompanied by ignorance". Whereas it says, "Sensation arises by reason of contact.
tasmādacittikā nirodhasamāpattiriti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	Hence, say the Vaibhāṣikas, the mind is interrupted in the absorption of extinction.
kathamacittikāyāḥ samāpattitvam /	If this absorption is completely free of mind, how is it an absorption? It is called an absorption because it puts the primary elements into a state of equilibrium contrary to the production of the mind; or rather because ascetics penetrate it by the power of their minds: it is for this reason that the Dhyānas, etc. , are called.
mahābhūtasamatāpādanāt /	Yes, for they thwart the arising of the mind. No, it is not what you term “absorption” that hinders the arising of the mind; rather, it is the “mind in absorption”, the mind that precedes the state of absorption: this mind, being opposed to the arising of the mind, causes other minds to not arise for a certain time. The mind of absorption renders the person or series contrary to, and unfitted to the arising of the mind.
samāpatticittena ca tāṃ samāpadyante samāgacchantīti samāpattiḥ /	What is called “absorption” is simply the non-existence of the mind for a certain period of time; not a thing in and of itself, but a “thing of designation”.
kiṃ punarete samāpattī dravyataḥ sta utāho prajñaptitaḥ / dravyata ityāha /	How can an absorption be conditioned if it is not a thing in and of itself?
cittotpattipratibandhanāt / na / samāpatticittenaiva tatpratibandhanāt /	This “non-existence of the mind” was not realized before the mind of absorption;
samāpatticittameva hi taccittāntaraviruddhamutpadyate yena kālāntaraṃ cittasyā pravṛttimātraṃ bhavati / tadviruddhāśrayāpādanāt /	it ceases when the ascetic produces anew the mind.
yā 'sau samāpattiriti prajñapyate taccāpravṛttimātraṃ na pūrvamāsīnna paścāt bhavati vyutthitasyeti saṃskṛtā 'sau samāpattiḥ prajñapyate /	One can then, in a manner of speaking, designate it as being “conditioned,” since it begins and ends.
athavā āśrayasyaiva tathā samāpādanaṃ samāpattiḥ /	Or rather, what we call “absorption” is the condition of the. person, a condition that results from the mind of absorption.
evamāsaṃjñikamapi draṣṭavyam /	The same holds for non-consciousness. Āsaṁjñikéa is not a thing in and of itself that hinders the arising of the mind;
cittamevāsau tatra cittapravṛttiviruddhaṃ labhate taccāpravṛttimātramāsaṃjñikaṃ prajñapyata iti tadetanna varṇayanti / vyākhyāte samāpattī //	but we designate by this term the state of non-consciousness of the Non-Conscious gods, a state that results from a certain mind. The Vaibhāṣikas do not agree with this opinion; they maintain that āsaṁjñika and the two absorptions are things in and of themselves.
jīvitaṃ katamat /	What is the vital oṟgan?
āyurjīvitam evaṃ hyuktamabhidharme 'jīvitenriyaṃ katamat /	Jīvita is life. In fact, the Abhidharma says, “What is the jṝvikendriya?
traidhātukamāyuri“ti /	The āyus of the three spheres of existence.”
etaccaiva na jñāyate āyurnāma ka eṣa dharma iti /	What sort of dharma is the āyus?

idamuktaṃ bhagavatā “āyurūṣmātha vijñānaṃ yadā kāyaṃ jahatyamī / apaviddhastadā śete yathā kāṣṭhamacetana” iti //	For the Blessed One said, “When life, warmth and consciousness leave the body, the body lies abandoned, like wood, lacking feeling.
tad ya ūṣmaṇo vijñānasya cādhārabhūto dharmaḥ sthitihetustadāyuḥ /	There exists then a distinct dharma, a support of warmth and of consciousness, a cause of the duration of the series, natmed āyu.
tasyedānīmāyuṣaḥ ka ādhārabhūtaḥ /	If the ġyur supports warmth and consciousness, what supports it? It is supported by warmth and consciousness. If these three dharmas,—life, warmth, and consciousness,—mutually support one another and continue to exist by means of this mutual support, how do they come to an end?
evaṃ tarhi parasparāpekṣyavṛttitvādeṣāṃ kaḥ pūrvaṃ nivartiṣyate /	Which perishes first, the destruction of which entails the destruction of the others?
yadvaśādibhavau vivarttiṣyete iti nityānivṛttiprasaṅgaḥ /	For if one of them does not perish first, then these three dharmas will be eternal and will not perish.
āyuṣastarhi karmādhārabhūtaṃ yāvadākṣiptaṃ karmaṇā tāvadanuvarttanāt /	The āyus is supported by means of actions; the āyus has been projected through actions and continues to exist as long as the projection of action allows it to do so.
ūṣmavijñānayorapi kimarthaṃ karmaivādhārabhūtaṃ neṣyate /	If this is so, why admit that warmth and consciousness are supported by actions? What do we have to do with the āyṇus? That which is supported by action is, in its nature, retribution.
mā bhūt sarvaṃ vijñānamāmaraṇādvipāka iti /	If the consciousness were supported by action, all consciousness from the womb to death, would be retribution; and this is false. Hence the necessity of the āyus, supported by action, the support of warmth and consciousness.
ūṣmaṇastarhi karmādhārbhūtaṃ bhaviṣyati ūṣmā ca vijñānasya /	You say then that action supporṟts warmth andThen the warmth supports consciousness. The āyus is necessary, for warmth is absent in Ārūpyadhātu.
evamapyārūpyeṣvanādhāraṃ vijñānaṃ syādūṣmābhāvāt / tasya punaḥ karmādhāro bhaviṣyati / [073/28-074/01	What is the support of consciousness in Ārūpyadhātu if the gyws does not exist?
na vai labhyate kāmacāro yat kvacidevoṣmā vijñānasyādhāro bhaviṣyati kvacideva karmeti / uktaṃ cātra /	In Ārūpyadhātu, consciousness is supported by action.
kimuktam /	Do you have the right to change your mind? Sometimes you maintain that the consciousness is supported by warmth, and sometimes you maintain that it is supported by actions.
“mā bhūtsarvaṃ vijñānamāmaraṇādvipāka” iti /	But on the other hand, you have admitted that one should avoid the conclusion that all consciousnesses, from the womb to death, are retribution.
tasmādastyeva tayorādhārabhūtamāyuḥ /	Consequently the āyus exists, and it is the support of warmth and consciousness.
nahi nāstīti brūmo natu dravyāntaram /	We do not deny the existence of the āyus.
kiṃ tarhi / traidhātukena karmaṇā nikāyasabhāgasya sthitikālāvedhaḥ /	We only say that the ġyus is not a thing in and of itself. Then what is the dharma that you call āyus?
yāvaddhi karmaṇā nikāyasabhāgasyāvedhaḥ kṛto bhavatyetāvantaṃ kālamavasthātavyamiti tāvat so 'vatiṣṭhate tadāyurityucyate /	It is a certain power that the action of a previous existence places in a being at the moment of its conception, a power through which the séandhas renew themselves for a determined length of time in this homogeneous series that constitutes an. existence, in the same way a seed places a certain power in the sprout by which the plant develops to maturity.
sasyānāṃ pākakālāvedhavat kṣipteṣusthitikālāvedhavacca /	In this same way too a shot arrow has a certain power which causes it to travel for a certain period of time.

tasya tadekatvāt pratipannābhāvācca deśāntaraiḥ śīghra taratamaprāptikālabhedā nupapattiḥ patanānupapattiśca /	By the force of this guṇa, the arrow travels without stopping until the moment it falls. The saṁskāra is unique; on the one hand, the arrow does not encounter any obstacle: hence no difference is possible in the speed of the arrow. On the other hand, the arrow will not fall.
vāyunā tatpratibandha iti cet /	Would you say the “wind” creates an obstacle to the sa/skāra?
arvākpatanaprasaṅgo na vā kadācidvāyoraviśeṣāt /	The “wind'” which creates an obstacle is the same either far or near, and so the arrow would either fall at first, or it will never fall.

jñānaprasthāne 'pyuktam “āyuḥ santatyupanibaddhaṃ vartata iti vaktavyam / sakṛdutpannaṃ tiṣṭhanīti vaktavyam / āha /	The Jñānaprasthāana says, “Should one say of the āyus that it is 'dependent on the series,' or that 'it lasts once it has arisen?
kāmāvacarāṇāṃ sattvānāmasaṃjñisamāparttiṃ nirodhasamāparttiṃ ca samāpannānāṃ santatyupanibaddhaṃ varttata iti vaktavyam / samāpannānāṃ rūpārūpyāvacarāṇāṃ ca sattvānāṃ sakrdutpannaṃ tiṣṭhatīti vaktavyam” / ko 'sya bhāṣitasyārthaḥ /	' The āyus is of the first category for beings in Kāmadhātu who are not in one of the two absorptions, but it is of the second category for beings in Kamadhātu who are in the two absorptions, and for beings in. ”If the āyus is killed when the body is killed, then the āyes is "bound to the body-series.” If the body cannot be damaged, then the āyur lasts all the time for which it has been produced, and one says that the āyas lasts once it has arisen.

tasmādastyakālamṛtyuḥ /	Thus there is premature death.
sūtra uktam “catvāra ātmabhāvapratilambhāḥ / astyātmabhāvapratilambho yatrātmasaṃcetanā kramate na parasaṃcetane“ti / catuṣkoṭikaḥ /	According to the Sūtra, there are four modes of existence: existence that can be destroyed by oneself and not by another, etc. Four alternatives: 1.
ātmasaṃcetanaiva kramate kāmadhātau krīḍāpramoṣkāṇāṃ devānāṃ manaḥpradūṣakāṇāṃ ca / teṣāṃ hi praharṣamanaḥopradoṣābhyāṃ tasmāt sthānāccyutirbhavati nānyathā/ duddhānāṃ ceti vaktavyam / svayaṃmṛtyutvāt /	existence destroyed by oneself: certain beings in Kāmadhātu, namely the Krīdāpradūṣika gods and the Manaḥpradūṣika gods destroy their own existence through their excess of joy or anger; we must also add the Buddhas who enter into Nirvāra;
parasaṃcetanaiva kramate garbhāṇḍagatānām /	existences destroyed by others: beings in the womb and in eggs;
ubhayamapyeṣāṃ kāmāvacarāṇāṃ prāyeṇa / nobhayaṃ sarveṣā mantarābhavikāṇāṃ rūpārūpyāvacarāṇāmanekajātīyānāṃ kāmāvacarāṇāṃ	existences destroyed by oneself and by others: beings in Kāmadhātu inWe must exclude beings in bhell, beings in the intermediate state, etc. existences that are neither destroyed by oneself nor by others: beings in the intermediate state, all beings in Rūpadhātu and Ārūpyadhātu, and a part of the beings in Kāmadhātu: beings in hell, the inhabitants of Uttarakuru, petsons in the absorption of kindness, persons in the non-conscious absorption;
tadyathā nārakāṇā muttarakauravāṇāṃ darśanamārgamaitrīnirodhāsaṃjñi samāpattisamāpannānāṃ	the Rājarṣi, that is, the Cakravarṛtin who has left the householders's life; a messenger of the Buddha;
rājarṣijinadūtajinādiṣṭa dharmilo ttaragaṅgila śreṣṭhiputrayaśaḥ dumārajīvakādīnāṃ	persons whom the Buddha prophesized would live a certain length of time: Dharmila, Uttara, Gaṅgila, the son of the merchant Yaśas, Kumāra, Jīvaka, etc. ; the Bodhisattva in his last existence;
sarveṣā caramabhavikānāṃvodhisattva mātustadgarbhāyāḥ cakravarttinaścakravarttimātuśca tadgarbhāyāḥ /	the mother of the Bodhisattva pregnant with the Bodhisattva; the Cakravartin; the mother of the Cakravartin pregnant with the Cakravartin.
atha kasmātsūtra uktaṃ katame te bhadanta sattvā yeṣāṃ nātmasaṃcetanā kramate na parasaṃacetanā /	The Sūtra tells us of a question by Śariputra and the Blessed One's answer to it: “‘Lord, What are the beings whose existence cannot be destroyed either by themselves, or by others? ”How can you say, in the light of this passage, that the existence of all beings in Rūpadhātu and Ārūpyadhātu is protected from all destruction, either by themselves or others?
naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatanopagāḥ śāriputre“ti /	The School explains, “Beings in Rūpadhātu and the first three stages of Ārūpyadhātu can destroy their existence ‘by themselves,'” that is, by a course of action within their own realm, and ‘by others,' namely by a course of action belonging to the preliminary stages of a higher stage.
anyeṣu kila dhyānarūpyedhvātmasaṃcetanāsvabhūmika āryamārgaḥ parasaṃcetanā uttarabhūmisāmantakastatra cobhayaṃ nāstīti /	But in the last stage of Ārūpyadhātu a course of action belonging to this stage and also of actions of a superior stage are both absent; hence the existence of beings who reside therein cannot be modified either by themselves or by others. This answer appears weak to us;
nanu caivaṃ tatrāpi parabhūmika āryamārgaḥ parasaṃcetanā prāpnoti /	in fact, one can, in the last stage of Ārūpyadhātu practice a course of action belonging to the immediately lower stage. One must then admit another explanation. In his response to Śāriputa, theBuddha intends to designate all beings in Rūpadhātu and Arūpyadhātu.
paryantagrahaṇāttarhi tadādisaṃpratyayaḥ / kvacidādisaṃpratyayaḥ kvacidādinā paryanto 'pi pratīyate / yadāha /	We can demonstrate that such is the usage.
“tadyathā devā brahmakāyikāḥ / iyaṃ prathamā sukhopapattiriti / kvacit paryantenādirapi pratīyate /	Sometimes Scripture names the first term of a list the totality of which is alluded to, for example, “The first sukhopapaiti, namely the Brahmakāyika gods.
yadāha /	” We should then also understand, “the Brahmakāyikas, the Brahmapurohitas, and the Mahābrahmās.
tadyathā devā ābhāsvarāḥ / iyaṃ dvitīyā sukhopapattiri“ti	” Sometimes Scripture names the last term, “The second fukhopapatti, namely the Ābhāsvara gods. ” We should then understand, “the Parīttābhas, the Apramāṇābhas, and the Ābhāsvaras. ” But one can contest this explanation.
ayamatra tadyathāśabdo dṛṣṭāntavācaka iti yukta etasmāccheṣasaṃ pratyayaḥ / eṣa hi dṛṣṭāntadharmo yadekamapi tajjātīyakaṃ dṛśyate /	In the two passages given above the word £adyathā is used to introduce an example.
sa ceha tadyathāśabdo nāstītyanupasaṃhāra eṣaḥ / yadyayaṃ tadyathāśabdo dṛṣṭāntavācakaḥ syādiha na prāpnuyāt /	We must translate ¢adyathā not as “namely” but as “for example.

And we admit that, in the two above passages on the sukhopapattis, the Scripture designated all the terms of the list by.

etāni hi saṃskṛtasya catvāri lakṣaṇāni /	These four dharmas, arising, old age, duration, and impermanence, are the characteristics of conditioned things.
yatraitāni bhavanti sa dharmaḥ saṃskṛto lakṣyate / viparyayādasaṃskṛtaḥ /	A dharma in which these characteristics are found is conditioned; a dharma in which they are not found is unconditioned. Arising produces or causes to produce conditioned things; duration.
tatra jātistaṃ dharmaṃ janayati sthitiḥ sthapayati jarā jarayati anityatā vināśayati /	Stabilizes them or causes them to last; old age makes them deteriorate; and impermanence destroys them.
nanu “trīṇimāni saṃskṛta lakṣaṇānī“ti sūtra uktam /	Does not the Sūtra teach the existence of some three “conditioned characteristics' of conditioned things? The Sūtra says, in fact, “There are, oh Bhikṣus, three characteristics of conditioned things, which are themselves conditioned. What are these three? The production or origin of conditioned things is an object of consciousness; its disappearance and also its duration-modification is an object of consciousness.”
caturthamapyatra vaktavyaṃ syāt / kiṃ cātra noktam / āha /	The Sūtra should enumerate four characteristics.
sthitiḥ /	The characteristic that it omits is the characteristic of duration or sthiti.
yattarhi “idaṃ sthityanyathātvami“ti /	Truth to tell, it does use shi in the compound, sthiṭyanyathātva, “duration-modification;
jarāyā eṣa paryāyastadyathā jāterutpāda ityanityatāyāśca vyaya iti /	” but srhityanyathātva is an expression that signifies “old age.” As the Sūtra says “production” in place of “arising” and “disappeaṟance” in place of “impermanence”, in this same way it also says sthityanyathātva in place of “old age”.
ye hi dharmāḥ saṃskārāṇāmadhvasaṃcārāya pravṛttāsta eva sūtre lakṣaṇānyuktānyudvejanārtham /	If the Sūtra specifies only three characteristics, it is because, with aview to rousing disgust among believers, it points out as the characteristics of conditioned things those dharmas which cause conditioned things to pass through the three timne periods: the power of its arising causes it to pass from the future into the present;
jātirhi yā saṃskārānanāgatādadhvanaḥ pratyutpannamadhvānaṃ saṃcārayati / jarā 'nityate punaḥ pratyutpannādatītaṃ durbalīkṛtya pratighātāt /	old age and impermanence cause it to pass from the present into the past, and, after old age has weakened it, impermanence finishes it.
tadyathā kila gahanapraviṣṭasya puruṣasya trayaḥ śatravaḥ /	The School gives a comparision : Suppose there is a man in a dark forest, and there are three enemies there who wish to kill him. The first causes this man to leave the forest;
tata eka enaṃ gahanādākarṣet dvau punarjīvitādvacyaparopayetāṃ tadvaditi /	the second weakens him, and the third destroys his vital principle. Such is the role of the three characteristics with regard to conditioned things.
sthitistu tān saṃskārānupaguhya tiṣṭhatyaviyogamivecchantī /	Duration, on the contrary, sustains conditioned things and causes them to last;
ato 'sau saṃskṛtalakṣaṇaṃ na vyavasthāpitā /	this is why the Sūtra does not count it among the characteristics.
asaṃskṛtasyāpi ca svalakṣaṇe sthitibhāvāt /	Further, the unconditioned lasts eternally in its own nature: the characteristic of duration is not without resemblance to the persistence. So in order to avoid any confusion, the Sutra does not indicate duration as a characteristic of conditioned things.
anye punaḥ kalpayanti sthitiṃ jarāṃ cābhisamasya sthityanyathātvamityekaṃ lakṣaṇamuktaṃ sūtre /	The Sutra does name duration; it names it by associating it with old age: sthityanyathatva, that is to say, "sthii and anyathatva.
kiṃ prayojanam /	What advantage is there, would you say, in making one single characteristic out of these two characteristics?
eṣā hyeṣu saṅgāspadamataḥ śriyamivaināṃ kālakarṇīsahitāṃ darśayāmāsa tasyāmanāsaṅgārthamiti /	Persons are attracted to duration: in order to incite disgust with respect to duration, the Sutra names it together with old age, like prosperity associated with black ears.

teṣāmapi nāma jātyādīnāṃ saṃskṛtatvādanyairjātyādibhirbhavitavyam / bhavantyeva /	The arising, duration, etc. , of any sort of dharma is also conditioned.
jātijātyādayasteṣāṃ	They should also arise, last, grow old, and perish; they should then, in their turn, possess four characteristics: arising-of-arising, etc. , which will be the secondary characteristics of the dharma under consideration.
teṣāmapi catvāryanulakṣaṇāni bhavanti /	These secondary characteristics, being conditioned, have in their turn four characteristics, and so we have infinite. There is no infinite progression. They have in their turn characteristics termed arising-ofarising, duratioṉ-of-duṟatioṉ, etc. Four primary characteristics are as descṛibed above.
jātijātiḥ sthitisthitiḥ jarājarā anityatā 'nityatā iti / nanu caikasyaikasya caturlakṣaṇī prāpnoti aparyavasānadoṣaśca /	The four secondary characteristics are arising-ofarising, duration-of-duṟation, old age-of-old age, and impermanenceof-impermaṅṇence. All conditioned things are conditioned by these primary characteristics;
teṣāṃ punaranyajātyādiprasaṅgāt / na prāpnoti / yasmāt /	these, in their turn, are conditioned by the four secondary characteristics. You say that each of the primary characteristics should have, exactly as the dharma that it characterizes, foar characteristics, and thus following: you do not understand that these are the activity, the operationṅ of the different chaṟacteristics.
te 'ṣṭadharmaikavṛttayaḥ / teṣāṃ jātyādīnāmaṣṭāsu dharmeṣu vṛttiḥ / kimidaṃ vṛttiriti / kāritraṃ puruṣakāraḥ /	The primary characteristic refers to eight dharmas, the secondary characteristic to one dharma.

jātijātiḥ puna stāmeva jātim /	It does not cause itself to be produced: it arises through the secondary characteristic arising-of-arising.
tadyathā kila kācit kukkuṭī bahūnya patyāni prajāyate kācidalpāni /	In the same way a hen lays many eggs and each egg causes the birth of only one other chicken; in the same way primary arising causes eight dharmas to arise, whereas arising-of-arising causes only one dharma to arise, namely primary arising. It is the same for the other primary and secondary characteristics.
tadvat sthitirapyātmānaṃ varjayitvā 'nyānaṣṭau dharmān sthāpayati sthitisthitistu tāmeva sthitim /	Duration-of-duration causes primary duration to last, which in turn causes the principal dharma to last, as well as the three primary characteristics and the four secondary characteristics comprising duration-of-duration.
evaṃ jarā 'nityate api yathāyogyaṃ yajye /	The same for primary old age and impermanence which causes eight dharmas to age and to perish, and which age and perish themselves through the secondary characteristics.
tasmānā bhavatyanavasthāprasaṅgaḥ /	Hence the characteristics themselves have characteristics called anulakṣaṇas; they are four in number and not sixteen, and there is no infinite progression.
tadetadākāśaṃ pāṭyata iti sautrāntikāḥ /	The Sautrāntikas say: ī. AIl this is to analyze emptiness!
nahyete jātyādayo dharmā dravyataḥ saṃvidyante yathā 'bhivyajyante / kiṃ kāraṇam / pramāṇābhāvāt /	Arising, duration, etc. , are not entities, separate things in and of themselves.
nahyeṣāṃ dravyato 'stitve kiñcidapi pramāṇamasti pratyakṣamanumānamāptāgamo vā yathā rūpādīnāṃ dharmāṇāmiti /	We know things either through direct perception, through inference, or through the testimony of Scripture: these three means of correct knowledge ate missing with respect to these characteristics.
yattarhi sūtra uktaṃ “saṃskṛtasyotpādo 'pi prajñāyate vyayo 'pi sthityanyathātvamapī” ti / granthajño devānāṃ priyo natvarthajñaḥ /	But, the Sūtra says “The production of coṇditioned things is an object of consciousness . Ignorant! You are attached to the words and err with regard to their meaning.
arthaśca pratiśaraṇa muktaṃ bhagavatā /	The Blessed One however said that it is the meaning, and not the letter, that is the recourse.
kaḥ punarasyārthaḥ /	As for the sense of this Sūtra, it is obvious.
avidyāndhā hi bālāḥ saṃskārapravāhamātmāta ātmīyataścādhimuktā abhiṣvajante /	Blinded by ignorance, foolish persons imagine that the series of conditioned phenomena is a “self” or belongs to a "self,”The Blessed One wanted to put an end to this erroneous imagination and to the attachment which results from it: he wanted to show that the series is conditioned, that is to say, “produced through successive causes” ;
tasya mithyādhimokṣasya vyāvarttanārthaṃ bhagavāṃstasya saṃskārapravāhasyasaṃskṛtatvaṃ pratītyasamutpannatāṃ dyotayitukāma idamāha “triṇīmāni saṃskṛtasya saṃskṛtalakṣaṇāni” / na tu kṣaṇasya /	and he taught the three marks of that which is produced through successive causes, saying that “Three savskṛ̥alaksaṉas of the saṁskṛta are the object of consciousness.
nahi kṣaṇasyotpādādayaḥ prajñāyante /	It is the series that the Blessed One means to designate as conditioned, for, quite clearly, he does not attribute the three marks to each moment of the series, since he says that these marks are the object of consciousness: in fact, the production of the momeart, its aging, and its disappearance, are not the objects of consciousness;
nacāprajñāyamānā ete lakṣaṇaṃ bhavitumarhanti / atha evātra sūtre “saṃskṛtasyotpādo 'pi prajñāyata” ityuktam /	whatever is not the object of consciousness canvpot be a mark. If the Sūtra uses the word sa/ṁskṛta twice, “There are three saṁskr̥talakṣaṇas of the saṁsṣkr̥ta,” this is in order that one should know that these three marks are not marks showing the presence of.
punaḥ saṃskṛtagrahaṇaṃ saṃskṛtatve lakṣaṇānīti yathā vijñāye ta / maivaṃ vijñāyi saṃskṛtasya vastuno 'stitve lakṣaṇāni jalavalākāvat sādhvasādutve vā kanyālakṣaṇavaditi /	According to us, what one should understand by production or arising is the fact that the series begins;
tatra pravāhasyādirutpādo nivṛttirvyayaḥ /	disappearance or impermanence is the end or cessation of the series;
sa eva pravāho 'nuvarttamānaḥ sthitiḥ /	duration is the series continuing from its beginning until its end;
tasya pūrvāparaviśeṣaḥ sthityanyathātvam /	evolution or old age is the modification of the continuous series, the difference between its successive states. It is from this point of view—that is, by considering arising, enduring, prolonging itself, and modifying itself—that theFine, my man!
evaṃ ca kṛtvoktaṃ “viditā eva nandasya kulaputrasya vedanā utpadyante viditā ava tiṣṭhante viditā astaṃ parikṣayaṃ paryādānaṃ gacchantī“ti / āha cātra	You know that your sensations arise, last, end, and disappear.
“jātirādiḥ pravāhasya vyayaśchedaḥ sthitistu saḥ /	We would then say, “Arising is the beginning of the series, disappearance is its rapture; duration is the series itself;
sthityanyathātvaṃ tasyaiva pūrvāparaviśiṣṭatā //“	evolution is the difference between its successive states,” And again,
“jātirapūrvo bhāvaṃ sthitiḥ prabandho vyayastaducchedaḥ /	“Arising is existence following upon non-existence; duration is the series; impermanence is the rupture of the series;
sthityanyathātvamiṣṭaṃ prabandhapūrvāparaviśeṣa” iti //	and evolution is supposed to be the difference between the successive states of the series.”
“kṣaṇikasya hi dharmasya vinā sthityā vyayo bhavet /	“Since the dharmas are momentary, would you say that the dharmas will perish if duration is lacking?
na ca vyetyeva tenāsya vṛthā tatparikalpanā //“ tasmāt pravāha eva sthitiḥ /	But they perish spontaneously: in vain you attribute duration to a momentary dharma.”
evaṃ ca kṛtvā 'yamapyabhidharmanirdeśa upapannno bhavati /	Consequently it is the series that the Sūtra refers to when it speaks of duration, and the definition of the Abhidharma is justified,
“sthitiḥ katamā /	“What is duration?
utpannānāṃ saṃskārāṇāmavināśa” iti / nahi kṣaṇasyotpannasyāvināśo 'stīti /	The sa/īskāraṣ arisenThe nature of the moment cannot be arisen and not be destroyed.
yadapi ca jñānaprasthāna uktam “ekasmiṃścitte ka utpādaḥ / āha /	Yet the Jñānaprasthāna says, "Relative to one mind, what is production?

ko vyayo maraṇam /	What is disappearance? It is death.
kiṃ sthityanyathātvaṃ jare“ti /	What is evolution? It is old age.
tatrāpi nikāyasabhāgacittaṃ yujyate /	" But this passage of the Śāstra does not refer to a moment of the mind, but to the mind of a homogeneous existence.
pratikṣaṇaṃ cāpi saṃskṛtasyaitāni lakṣaṇāni yujyante vinā 'pi dravyāntarakalpanayā / kathamiti /	However, since one cannot consider characteristics as things in and of themselves, one can say that each moment taken separately possesses the four characteristics.
pratikṣaṇamabhūtvābhāva utpādaḥ /	In fact, each moment exists after having been non-existent: its existence, following upon its non-existence, is its arising;
bhūtvā 'bhāvo vyayaḥ /	after having existed, it does not exist anymore: this is its disappearance;
pūrvasya pūrvasyottarakṣaṇānuvandhaḥ sthitiḥ /	the duration of the moment is the concatenation or the process of successive moments: in fact, if the subsequent moment resembles the previous moment, it is then its substitute: the previous moment still. Thus the subsequent moment can be considered as the duration of the previous moment;
tasyāvisdṛśatvaṃ sthityanyathātvamiti / yadā tarhi sadṛśā utpadyante /	the dissimilitude of duration is its transformation.
na te nirviśeṣā bhavanti / kathamidaṃ jñāyate /	Would you say that there is no dissimilitude when the successive moments are similar?
kṣiptākṣiptabalidurbalakṣiptasya vajrādeścirāśutarapātakālabhedāttanmahābhūtānāṃ pariṇāmaviśeṣasiddheḥ /	There is dissimilitude, as this results from the difference in time of the slower or faster falling of a vajra that is or is not projected, and which is projected with or without force: difference due in each case to a transformation or a difference of the primary elements of the vajra. When the dharmas succeed themselves in a homogeneous series, the difference is small;
nātivahuviśeṣabhinnāstu saṃskārāḥ satyapyanyathātve sadṛśā eva dṛśyante /	that is why, although they differ, they are considered as similar. Your definition of characteristics does not hold for all conditioned dharmas. In fact, your definition of duration supposes a subsequent moment: but such a moment does not exist for the last moment of the mind of an Arhat.
antimasya tarhi śabdārciḥkṣaṇasya parinirvāṇakāle ca ṣaḍāyatanasyottarakṣaṇābhāvāt sthityahnyanyathātvaṃ nāstītyavyāpinī lakṣaṇavyavasthā prāpnoti	Hence the last moment of a sound, a flame, or an Arhat, has neither duration nor transformation.
na vai saṃskṛtasya sthitirevocyate /	We do not attribute duration to all conditioned dharras!
lakṣaṇamapi tu sthityanyathātvam /	We say rather, that all duration is subject to transformation. The Blessed One teaches three characteristics, because, in certain cases, there are three characteristics.
ato yasyāsti sthitistasyāvaśyamanyathātvaṃ bhavatīti nāsti lakṣaṇavyavasthābhedaḥ /	But, for the last moment of a flame, there is only producation and disappearance, and no duration or transformation. In short, conditioned dharmas exist after having existed; after having existed, they no longer exist;
samāsatastvatra sūtre saṃskṛtasyedaṃ lakṣaṇamiti dyotitaṃ bhagavatā “saṃskṛtaṃ nāma yadbhūtavā bhavati bhūtvā ca punarna bhavati yaścāsya sthitisaṃjñakaḥ prabandhaḥ so 'nyathā cānyathā ca bhavatī“ti /	the series of dharmas is their duration; dissimilarity of the series is their transformation. Such is the teaching that the Blessed One gives in the Sū⁸ra of the Three Characteristics.
kim atra dravyāntarair jātyādibhiḥ katham idānīṃ sa eva dharmo lakṣyas tasyaiva lakṣaṇaṃ yokṣyate /	This has nothing to do with things in and of themselves, arising, etc. According to you, arising is the dharma itself in so far as it exists after having been non-existent. The dharma which is the “thing characterized”, would then be the characteristic also. What is wrong with that?
kathaṃ tāvan mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇāni mahāpuruṣān nānyāni sāsnā-lāṅgūla-kakuda-śapha-viṣāṇādīni	The marks of a Mahāpuruṣa are not different or distinct from the Mahāpuruṣa himself.
ca gotvalakṣaṇāni gor nānyāni kāṭhinyādīni ca pṛthivīdhātvādīnāṃ lakṣaṇāni tebhyo nānyāni /	The horns, theThe hump, the fetlock, the hoof, and the tail of a cow, which are its marks, are not different from the cow.
yathā codhrvagamanena dūrāddhūmasya dhūmatvaṃ lakṣyate naca tattasmādanyat / sa evātra nyāyaḥ syāt /	The primary elements do not exist apart from their individual characteristics, solidity, etc. In this same way, for the Vaibhāṣikas who affirm the “momentariness” of the dharmas, the rising of smoke is none other than the smoke itself. Let us look at this a bit closer.
naca saṃskṛtānāṃ rūpādīnāṃ tāvat saṃskṛtatvaṃ lakṣyate / gṛhṇatāpi svabhāvaṃ yāvat prāgabhāvo na jñāyate paścācca santateśca viśeṣaḥ /	Although I grasp the individual nature of visible things, etc. , which are conditioned, yet as long as I do not know the fact that they did not exist previously, that they will not exist later, and that their series transforms itself, then I shall not know their quality of being conditioned.
tasmānna tenaiva tallakṣitaṃ bhavati naca tebhyo dravyāntarāṇyeva jātyādīni vidyante /	Consequently, the quality of being conditioned does not have for a mark the quality of being conditioned, but rather previous non-existence, etc. And there do not exist characteristics, things in and of themselves, distinct from visible things and other conditioned things.
athāpi nāma dravyāntarāṇyeva jātyādīni bhaveyuḥ / kimayuktaṃ syāt /	If we admit the reality of characteristics, then since they are.
eko dharmaḥ ekasminneva kāle jātaḥ sthito jīrṇo naṣṭaḥ syādeṣāṃ sahabhūtvāt / kāritrakālabhedāt / anāgatā hi jātiḥ kāritraṃ hi karoti /	Given as simultaneous, we would have to admit that obe harma arises, lasts, grows old and perishes at one and the seme time.
yasmānna jātaṃ janyate janite tu dharme varttamānāḥ kṣityādayaḥ kāritraṃ kurvantīti na yadā jāyate tadā tiṣṭati jīryati vinaśyati vā /	It is in vain that the Sarvāstivādins pretend that the characteristics do not exercise their activity at one and the same time; that arising engenders before being born itself, being still in a future state, and that once it is born it does not engender any longer; that duration, old age, and impermanence exercise their activity when they are present and not in a future state; and that, consequently, the last three characteristics are active in a moment when the fitst is no longer active, so the four characteristics can be simultaneous without contradiction.
idaṃ tāvadiha saṃpradhāryaṃ bhavet /	Let us first consider arising which, being future, engenders.
kimanāgataṃ dravyato 'sti nāstīti paścājjanayati vā naveti sidhyet /	One must examine whether a future dharma, supposing that it does exist, can be active.
satyapi tu tasmin jātiḥ kāritaraṃ kurvatī kathamanāgatā sidhyatītyanāgata lakṣaṇaṃ vaktavyam /	If future arising produces the operation of engendering, how can one say that it is future? In fact, accoṟding to the Vaibhāṣikas, a future ḍharma is one that does not exercise its activity.
uparatakāritrā cotpannā kathaṃ varttamānā sidhyatīti varttamānalakṣāṇaṃ vaktavyam /	You wouldOn the other hand, when a dharrma has arisen, has been engendered, and the operation of arising is past, how can you say that arising is then of the present? You would have to define present.
sthityādayo 'pi ca yugapat kāritre varttamānā ekakṣaṇa eva dharmasya sthitajīrṇavinaṣṭatāṃ prasañjeyuḥ /	And either the activity of the other characteristics is exercised simultaneously, or their activity is exercised in succession.
yadaiva hyenaṃ sthitiḥ sthāpayati tadaiva jrā jarayati anityatā vināśayatīti /	In the first hypothesis, whereas duration makes a dharma last, old age makes it age and impermanence destroys it: the dharma lasts, ages and perishes at the same time. As for the second hypothesis, to admit that the activity of these characteristics is not simultaneous is to admit three moments, and this is to renounce the doctrine of momentariness.
kimayaṃ tatra kāle tiṣṭatvāhosvijjīryatu vinaśyatu vā yo 'pi hi brūyāt sthityādīnāmapi kāritraṃ krameṇeti tasya kṣaṇikatvaṃ bādhyate /	For us, the kṣaṇa or moment is the time during which the characteristics have achieved their operation. Then explain why, in this hypothesis, duration, arising at the same time as old age and impermanence, accomplishes its operation of "making last that which should last" before old age and impermanence.
athāpyevaṃ brūyāt eṣa eva hi naḥ kṣaṇo yāvataitat sarvaṃ samāpyata iti / evamapoi tābhyāṃ sahotpannā sthitistāvat sthāpayati na jrā jarayati anityatā vā vināśyatīti / kuta etat / sthiterbalīyastvāt / punaḥ kenāvalīyastvam / yadaināṃ saha dharmeṇānityatā hanti /	If you answer that duration, being stronger, accomplishes its operation first, then we would ask how duration is weakened later in such a manner that, encountering old age and impermanence, it ages and perishes, not alone, but with the dharma that it should have made last.
kṛtakṛtyā punaḥ karttuṃ notsahate jātivat / sthaturyuktamanutsoḍhum /	You say perhaps that duration, having achieved its task, cannot perform it again, in the same way that arising, having engendered something, engenders no more. The comparison is not legitimate. The operation of arising consists of attracting the dharma that it should engender from the future and causing it to enter into the present;
nahi śakyaṃ jātyādijanyaṃ vartamānatāmānītaṃ punarānetum /	once the dharma has entered into the present, arising is incapable of making it enter therein again. But the operation of duration is to make the dharma “which should be made to last” last, of hindering the dharma which makes old age and perishing last.
śakyaṃ tu khalu sthityā sthāpyamatyantamapi sthāpayitum /	Duration is capable of making that which lasts last indefinitely.
ato na yuktaṃ yannotsahate /	Consequently, duration isBy reason of what obstacle or from what adverse forces would the activity of duration cease once it has begun?
ko vā 'tra pratibandhaḥ / te eva jarā 'nityate / yadi hi te balīyasyau syātāṃ pūrvameva syātām /	Would these forces be old age and impermanence, old age weakening duration which impermanence then kills? Since, in this hypothesis, old age and impermanence are stronger than duration, it is proper then that they exercise their activity first. Further, according to your conception of duration and its role, it is through the activity of duration that, not only the principal dharma, but also old age and impermanence, last. Hence, when the activity of duration ends, the principal dharma, as well as old age and impermanence, cease their duration.
nivṛttakāritrāyāṃ khalvapi sthitau ta cāpi na tiṣṭataḥ sa cāpi dharma iti kathaṃ kutra vā kāritraṃ karttumutsahiṣyete kiṃ vā punastābhyāṃ karttavyam	We ask how, and with regard to what object, old age and impermanence exercise their activity of aging and causing to perish? We do not see what it is that old age and impermanence have to do.
sthitiparigrahāddhi sa dharma utpannamātro na vyanaśyat /	It is through duration that one dharma, once it arises, does not perish for a certain time, does not perish as soon as it arises. IfWe well understand the duration and impermanence of the dharma.
sa tu tayā vyupekṣyamāṇo niyataṃ na sthāsyatyayamevāsya vināśaḥ /	A dharma, after having arisen, does not perish.
syācca tāvadekasya dharmasyotpannasyāvināśaḥ sthitiḥ vināśo 'nityatā /	A dharma, after having lasted, perishes. But how can one attribute old age to a dharma?
jarā tu khalu sarvathātvena na tathā / pūrvāparaviśeṣāt vipariṇāmācca /	Old age is a transformation, a dissimilarity between two states.
atastadanyathātve 'nya eva /	Now, can one say of a single dharma that it becomes different from itself?
uktaṃ hi	If it remains this, it is not that;
“tathātvena jarā 'siddhiranyathātve 'nya eva saḥ /	if it is transformed, it is no longer this.
tasmānaikasya bhāvasya jarā nāmopapadyate”//	Hence the transformation of a dharma is impossible. According to another school, it is with the cooperation of external causes of destruction, fire or a hammer, etc. , that the characteristics of impermanence causes certain dharmas to perish, as wood or a pot.
yo 'pyāha nikāyāntarīyo “vināśa kāraṇaṃ prāpyānityatā vināśāyatī“ti tasya harītakīṃ prāpya devatā virecayatītyāpannaṃ bhavati kiṃ punastāṃ kalpayitvā	This is a theory as absurd as a sick person, who, after having taken a medicine, begs the gods to render it efficacious!
tat evāstu vināśakāraṇādvināśaḥ cittacaittānāṃ ca kṣaṇikatvābhyupagamāttadanityatāyā	In the logic of this system, it is the external causes of destruction which destroy, and the. The same School admits that the mind and its mental states, like sound or a flame, perish immediately, without any foreign causes intervening, through the characteristic of impermanence.
vināśakāraṇānapekṣatvāt sthityanityate kāritramabhinnakālaṃ kuryātāmityekasyaikatra kāle sthita vinaṣṭatā saṃprasajyeta /	Impermanence and duration accomplish their operation at one and the same time: a dharma lasts and perishes at the same time. This is inadmissible. We conclude that it is with regard to the series that the Blessed One teaches the characteristics of conditioned things.
tasmāt pravāhaṃ pratyetāni saṃskṛtalakṣaṇānyuktānītyevametatsūtraṃ sūnītaṃ bhavati /	Thus understood, the Sūtra does not invite criticism, "There are three characteristics that show that the conditioned is conditioned, that it is produced through successive causes.
apica yadyanāgatā jātirjanyasya janikā kimarthaṃ sarvamanāgataṃ yugapannotpadyate / yasmāt	If arising engenders, in a future state, the dharma that it should engender, why do not all future dharmas arise at one and the same time?
janyasya janikā jātirna hetupratyayairvenā //	Arising engenders the dharma that it should engender, but not without the cooperation of causes and conditions. Isolated arising does not have the force of engendering the dharma.
nahi vinā hetupratyayasāmagrayā jātirjanikā bhavati /	If this is the case, we rather believe that it is the cause that engenders, and not arising;
hetupratyayānāmeva tarhi sāmarthyaṃ paśyāmaḥ /	this characteristic accompanies the dharma since the beginning of time and causes the dharma to arise when, finally, the cause of this dharma encounterṛs another!
sati sāmargya bhāvādasati cābhāvānna jāteriti hetupratyayā eva jana kāḥsantaḥ /	When the causes are completed, the dharma arises; when they are not completed, it does not arise: what efficacy can we attribute to aṟising?
kiṃ ca bhoḥ sarvaṃ vidyamānamupalabhyate /	Do you pretend to know all the dharmas that exist?
sūkṣmā api dharmaprakṛtayaḥ saṃvidyante /	The nature of dharmas is subtle! Even though one sees them, one does not know their nature.
jātamityeva tu na syādasatyāṃ jātau ṣaṣṭhivacanaṃ ca rūpasyotpādaḥ iti yathā rūpasya rūpamiti /	Moreover, in the absence of the characteristic “arising,” the idea of “biṟth” would be absent. Aṇḍ if arising is nothing other than the dharma itself exisitng after having been nonexistent, the genitive “the arising of warmth” or “the arising of sensation” would not be justified;
evaṃ yāvadanityatā yathāyogaṃ vaktavyā /	for this amounts to saying “the warmth of warmth” or “the sensation of sensation.” This is the same.
tena tarhy anātmatvam apy eṣṭavyam anātmabuddhi-siddhyartham /	This theory leads you very far afield: in order to justify the idea of empty, or the idea of the impersonal, you would admit the existence of an entity called “emptiness” or the existence of an entity called “non-self.”

As for the genitive, you do not admit that the individual nature of warmth and warmth are different things, and yet you speak of the individual nature of warmth.
tasmāt prajñaptimātramevaitadabhūtvābhāvajñāpanārthaṃ kriyate jātamiti /	Hence you have not proven that “arising” is a thing in and of itself; you have not proven that this is not merely a designation of a dharma in so far as it exists after having been non-existent. When I want to teach someone that a certain dharma exists which formerly did not exist, I say to him, “This dhara has arisen,” and I designate this dharma as being born. Many dharmas—warmth, sensation, etc. ,. —arise, that is to say, “exist after having been nonexistent.”
sa cābhūtvābhāvalakṣāṇa utpādo bahuvikalpaḥ /	Hence there are many arisings, that is, many dharmas arising.
tasya viśeṣaṇārthaṃ rūpasyotpāda iti ṣaṣṭīṃ kurvanti yathā rupasaṃjñaka evotpādaḥ pratīyeta mā 'nyaḥ pratyāyīti /	Since arising is multiple, in order to distinguish it from other arisings, so that my questioner knows that it refers to an arising having the name “warmth” and not to an arising having the name “sensation,” I will employ the genitive, “the arising of warmth,” or “the arising of sensation,” although the arising of warmth is only the warmth arising.
tadyathā candanasya gandhādayaḥ śilāputrakasya śarīramiti /	In the same way one says, in the world, “the odor of sandalwood,” although sandalwood is only odor, or “the body of the bust,” although a bust is only its body.
evaṃ sthityādayo 'pi yathāyogaṃ veditavyāḥ /	We hold to the existence of the characteristic “arising,” which belongs to conditioned things and does not belong to unconditioned things, and we can easily explain this by.

jāyat ityabhūtvā bhavati /	We say that conditioned things arise, for they exist after having been non-existent.
asaṃskṛtaṃ ca nityamastīti na jāyate /	But how can unconditioned things arise, since they are eternal?
yathā ca dharmatayā na sarvaṃ jātimadiṣyate tathā na sarvaṃ jāyata ityeṣṭavyam /	You explain that certain dharmas, the unconditioned dharmas, are devoid of the characteristic "arising," because, you say, such is the nature of things: we say, rather, that by virtue of the nature of things, none of the dharmas are susceptible of arising. Moreover, according to you, all conditioned things equally possess the characteristic "arising" that you refuse to unconditioned things: yet you admit that certain causes are capable of producing warmth but incapable of producing sensation.

Why should we abandon the Āgamas for the sole reason that there are persons who object to them?

nāmakāyādayaḥ saṃjñāvākyākṣarasamuktayaḥ / ādigrahaṇena padavyañjanakāyagrahaṇam /	Nāmakāya, etc. , are collections of saṁġjñās, vākyas, and akṣaras.
tatra saṃjñākaraṇaṃ nāma /	Nāmam, “name” or “word” is understood as “that which causes ideas to arise,” for example the words “warmth,” “sound,” “odor,” etc. Pada or “phrase” is understood as vākya, a discourse, a phrase allowing the development necessary for a complete sentence, for example the stanza, “Impermanent are the sarséāras .

vākyaṃ padaṃ yāvatā 'rthaparisamāptistadyathā “anityā vata saṃskārā” ityevamādi yena kriyāguṇakālasaṃbandhaviśeṣā gamyante /	Or rather, one should understand pada as that which causes one to comprehend the different modalities of activity, quality, and time which concern a certain person: for example, he cooks, he reads, hehe cooks, he will cook, or he cooked.
vyañjanamakṣaraṃ tadyathā a ā ityevamādi / nanu cākṣarāṇyapi lipyavayavānāṃ nāmāni /	Vyañjana is understood as gkṣara or phoneme, vowels and consonents, for example, etc. But are not the gkṣaras the names of the letters?

kathamaśrūyamāṇāni lekhyena pratīyeranniti nākṣarāṇyeṣāṃ nāmāni /	but one makes or one writes the letters with a view to giving an idea of the phonemes, so that, when one does not understand them, one still has an idea of them through writing.
eṣāṃ ca saṃjñādīnāṃ samuktayo nāmādikāyāḥ / uca samavāye paṭhanti /	Consequently the phonemes are not the names of letters.
tasya samuktirityetad rūpaṃ bhavati /	Kāya or “body” means “collection;

In the second hypothesis, this same criticism holds by replacing the verb "to produce" with the verb "to manifest. But it is absurd to suppose that the voice produces a word.
na khalvapi śabdānāṃ sāmargyamasti kṣaṇaikamilanam /	In fact, sounds do not exist at the same time—one has, for example, r-i-p-a—whereas the word, which you define as a dharmna, an entity, cannot arise in parts.

Finally, unconditioned things would not have any ṇame, since they do not arise: a consequence that the Sarvāstivādins cannot admit.

kāraṇahetuḥ sahabhūhetuḥ sabhāgahetuḥ saṃprayuktakahetuḥ sarvatragahetuḥ vipākaheturiti / tatra	All dharmas are kāraṇahetu with regard to all, with the exception of themselves.
svato 'nye kāraṇaṃ hetuḥ	A dharma is not a kāraṇahetu of itself.
saṃskṛtasya hi dharmasya svabhāvavrjyāḥ sarvadharmāḥ kāraṇaheturutpādayati /	With this exception, that all of the dharmas are kāraṇahetu with regard to all other conditioned dharnas, because no dharma constitutes an obstacle to the arising of the dharmas susceptible of arising. It results from this definition that the dharmas that are sahabhūhetu, etc. , are also kāraṇahetu: all other heṭus are included within kāraṇahetu.
avighnabhāvāvasthānāt /	The hetu that does not receive a special name, which is simply ēāraṇa, 'reason for existence,' without any other qualification is kāraṇahetu: it receives as its particular name the name that suits all. Kāraṇahetu calls for the following observations: Vices are produced among the ignorant;
nanu ca ye 'syājānata udapatsyantāsravā jānato 'sya te notpadyanta iti jñānameṣāṃ	once the Truths are known, they are not produced, as the stars are not visible when the sun shines.
vighnamuatpattau karoti sūryaprabhāvajjyotiṣāṃ darśanasyeti kathaṃ svabhāvavarjyāḥ	Hence the consciousness of the Truths, or the sun, causes an obstacle to the vices, or to the stars.
sarvadharmāḥ saṃskṛtasya kāraṇaheturbhavanti /	Then it is false to say that all conditioned dharmas are kāraṇahetu because they create no obstacle to aṟiṣing.
utpadyamānasyāvidhnabhāvenāvasthānāditi jñātavyam /	We understand that the consciousness of the Truths and the clarity of the sun create no obstacle to the arising of the dharma which is “arising” , that is to say of the dharma, which, its causes being completed, continues to exist.
bhavettāvadutpattau vidhnakāraṇe samarthānāmavighnakāraṇāddhetutvam /	What is called cause or reason for existence, may be what is capable of causing, or of not causing, an obstacle!

Nirvāṇa isCan one consider them as causes? They are causes;

yastu pradhānaḥ kāraṇahetuḥ sa utpādane 'pi samartho yathā cakṣūrūpe cakṣurvijñānasya āhāraḥ śarīrasya vījādayo 'ṅkurādīnāmiti /	The definition that we have given of kāraṇahetu is a general definition and includes that which is kāraṇahetu par excellence and that which is simply kāraṇahetu. Kāraṇahetu par excellence is the generating cause: in this sense, eye and color are the kāranahetu of the consciousness of sight; as food is with regard to the body, the seeds, etc. , with regard to the sprout, etc. If all the dharmas are the causes of other dharmas because they do not cause any obstacle, why do not all the dharmas?

tasyedamacodyam /	This objection is useless.
yasmādanāvaraṇabhāvena sarvadharmāḥ hetuḥ pratijñāyante na kārakabhāveneti /	In fact, all the dharmas receive the name of hāraṇahetu because they do not create any obstacle; it is not that they are all agents.
sarvasyaiva kāraṇahetoḥ sarvotpattau sāmarthyamityapare /	According to other masters, all kāraṇahetus possess a real efficacy with regard to all dharmas.
tadyathā nirvāṇasyāpi cakṣurvijñānam / kathaṃ kṛtvā /	Fot example Nirvāṇa and the consciousness of sight: a mental consciousness, good or bad, arises having Nirvāṇa as its object;

uktaḥ kāraṇahetuḥ / sahabhūrye mithaḥphalāḥ /	The same argument applies to future dharmas, to beings in hell, etc. Sahabhūhetu, coexistent causes, namely the elements, the mind and the companions of the mind, characteristics and the thing characterized, are the dharmas that are causes one of the other.

evaṃ ca kṛtvā sarvameva saṃskṛtaṃ sahabhūheturyathāyogam /	In the category of sahabhūhetu are then included all conditioned dharmas which are in a mutual relationship of causality. We have reason not to complete the above definition.
vināpi cānyonyaphalatvena dharmo 'nulakṣaṇānāṃ sahabhūheturna tāni tasyetyupasaṃkhyātavyam //	A dharma is a sahabhūhetu of its secondary characteristics without being in a mutual relationship of causality with them: for the secondary characteristics are not the sahabhūhetu of their dharma. This is a case to be added to the definition.
ke punarete cittānuvarttino dharmāḥ /	What dharmas are called “the companions of the mind? ” The companions of the mind are: the mental states;
caittā dvau saṃvarau teṣāṃ cetaso lakṣaṇāni ca / cittānuvarttinaḥ	the two disciplines; and the characteristics of the mental states, the two disciplines and the mind.

They are of the same time period as the mind. When we say “the same arising,” we understand the word “same” in the sense of concomitance: the companions arise, last, and perish at the same time as does the mind; but their arising is distinct. The minds that are not destined to arise do not arise, nor last, nor perish: the same for their companions. This is why the phrase, “The companions are of the same time period as the mind” is added. The mind which should arise is future until the moment when it arises if it is to arise: its companions are hence future; it is past after the moment when it shall perish if it arose: its companions are then past.
phalādibhirekaphalavipākaniḥṣyandatayā / pūrvakastvekaśabdaḥ sahārthe veditavyaḥ /	In regard to the result, etc. Result means phala and visaṁyogaphala; and “et cetera” refers to. The companions have the same result, the same vipāka, and the same niṣyanda as the mind: “same” indicates identity.
śubhatādibhiḥ kuśalākuśalāvyākṛtacitte kuśalākuśalāvyākṛtatayā /	In regard to goodness, etc. , the companions are good, bad, or neutral, like the mind which they accompany.

tasya punaścatuḥpañcāśaddharmāḥ sahabhūhetuḥ / svānyanulakṣaṇāni sthāpayitvā /	If, from these fifty-eight dharmas, the four secondary characteristics of the mind which have no effect upon it are set aside, then we have fifty-four dharmas that are sahabhūhetu of the same mind.

“syādduḥkhasatyaṃ satkāyadṛṣṭihetukaṃ na satkāyadṛṣṭerhetuḥ /	As the secondary characteristics have no effect on the mind, the characteristics of the mahābhūmikas likewise have no effect.

ye tarhi “tatsaṃprayuktānāṃ ca dharmāṇā mi” tyetanna pathanti tairapyetat pathitavyam arthato vaivaṃ boddhavyamiti kāśmīrāḥ /	” Certain Masters, in their reading of the Prakaraṇagrantha, omit the words, “and of the dharmas associated with this belief. ” According to the Vaibhāṣikas of Kásmiīr, these words figure in the text; or, if they are missing, the context indicates that one should supply them and that the passage as it stands is incomplete.
yaktāvat sahabhūhetunā hetuḥ sahabhvapi tat /	Any dharma that is a sahabhūhetu cause is a sahabhū or a coexistant item.
syāttu sahābhūrna sahabhūhetunā hetuḥ / dharmasyānulakṣaṇāni /	But there are some ‘coexistant items that are not sahabhūhetuṃ: the secondary characteristics of the principal dharma are not a sababhūbetu regarding this dharma. The secondary characteristics of the companions of the mind are not a sahabhūhetu regarding the mind.

anuparivarttyanulakṣanāni caivaṃ cittasya tāni cānyonyaṃ sapratighaṃ copādāyarūpamanyonyamapratighaṃ	Derived matter, blue, etc. , susceptible of resistance and which has also arisen together, are not a sahabhṁūhetu among themselves. A part of derived matter not susceptible to resistance and also arisen together with them, is not a sahabhñhetu; with the exception of the two disciplines. No derived matter, even though arisen with the elements, is a sahabhūhetu with the elements.
ca kiñcit sarvaṃ ca bhūtaiḥ prāptayaśca sahajāḥ prāptimataḥ sahabhuvo na sahabhūheturanekaphalavipāka niṣyandatvāt /	Possession (prāpti, even when it arises with the dharma to which it is related, is not a sahabhāhetr to it. The dharmas of these eight categories are coexistant, but are not sahabhūheku, because their results, vápāka or niṣyanda, are not identical.
na caitāḥ sahacariṣṇavaḥ pūrvamapyutpatteḥ paścādapīti /	As for possession, it does not always accompany the dharma: it arises either before the dhara, or after it, or at the same time as it.
sarvamapyetat syāt /	All this may be right, that is, “what is a sahabhūhetu cause, a”. Nevertheless, in the world, the relationship of cause to effect is well proven in certain cases: the cause is previous to the effect. It is in this way that a seed is the cause of the sprout, the sprout of the stalk, etc. But one does not prove a similar relationship between simultaneous things.
kiṃ tu prasiddhahetuphalabhāvānāṃ bījādīnāmeṣa nyāyo na dṛṣṭa iti vaktavyametat kathaṃ sahotpannānāṃ dharmāṇāṃ hetuphalabhāva iti /	You should then demonstrate that dharmas arisen together can be in a cause and effect relationship. The lamp arises with its light; the sprout, growing in the light, arises with its shadow.
tadyathā pradīpaprabhayoraṅkuracchāyayośca /	Now a lamp is the cause of its light and a sprout is the cause of its shadow. Thus cause and effect can be simultaneous. These examples are not proven.

yasya bhāvābhāvayoḥ yasya bhāvābhāvau niyamataḥ sa heturitaro hetumāniti /	The relationship of cause and effect is proven by the existence and the non-existence of what is called effect, similar to the existence and the non-existence of what is called cause.
sahabhuvām ca dharmāṇāmekasya bhāve sarveṣāṃ bhāva ekasyābhāve sarveṣāmabhāva iti yukto hetuphalabhāvaḥ /	The definition of the Logicians is very good: “When A is or is not, and when B is or is not, then A is considered as cause, and B is considered as effect.” Granted this, if we examine the dharmas that we have defined as mutually coexistent and sahabh%hetu, we see that they all exist when one of them exists, and that none exist when one of them is absent. They are then in a relationship of mutual cause and effect. Admitting that among the simultaneous dharmas, one dharma can be the cause of another dharma, then the organ of sight is the cause of visual consciousness.
syāttāvatsahotpannānāṃ parasparaṃ tu katham /	But how many simultaneous dharmas are the cause and effect of one another? Mutual causality is proven by the definition that we have given of causality.

Very well, but then the Sarvāstivādins shouldIn fact, they have denied mutual causality to derived matter although physical matter never exists without taste; they have denied mutual causality to derived matter and to the primary elements, and mutual causality to secondary characteristics and the mind.
tridaṇḍānyonyabalāvasthānavattarhi sahabhuvāṃ hetuphalabhāvaḥ sidhyati / mīmāṃsyaṃ tāvadetat /	In the same way that three staffs stand up supported one on the other, the causal relationship of simultaneous things, the mind and its mental states, etc. , is proven.

We ask whether the three staffs stand up together through the force that the three staffs possess through arising together, or rather, if the force of the complex of previous causes which caused them to arise together does not now also cause them to arise supported one on the other. Further, there are things here other than the mutual force of support: there is a rope and a hook, and there is the ground. But, mutually coexistant items have causes other than the sahabhūhetu, namely sabhāgahetu, sarvatraganhetu, aṇd vipākahetu, which have a role analogous to that of the.

Neutral, that is, undefiled-neutral, they are sabhāgahetu of neutral ones. Nevertheless, different masters are not in agreement on this last point. According to some, neutral r%pa is sabhāgahetu of the five neutral ṣbandhas, but the four sbkandhas,:—sensation, etc—are not sabhāgahetu of tūpa. According to others, four skandhas are sabhāghetu of the five;
catvārastu na rūpasyetyapare /	but rūpa is not sabhāgahetu of the four. Aṇnd according to others, rūpa is not sabhāgahetu of the four, and vice versa.

The secondEmbryonic state is the sabhāgahetu of nine states, and thus following.

From the point of view of the states of existence followed by the same species, each of the states of the previous existence is the similar cause of the ten states.
bāhyeṣvapi yavo yavasya śāliḥ śāleriti vistareṇa yojyam /	The same holds for external things, corn, rice, etc. , that is, the quality of sabhāgahetu remains confined in each series: corn is a similar cause of corn, not of rice. Physical matter is a similar cause of matter; but this contradicts the Book (Jñānaprasthāna, TD, p.

kiṃ punaḥ sarve sadṛśānāṃ sabhāgahetaḥ / netyāha / kiṃ tarhi / svanikāyabhuvaḥ /	Are all similar dharmas similar causes of similar dharmas? Similar causes are the similar dharmas which belong to the same category and the same stage. This means that the dharmas belonging to a certain category and.

na kadāciditi sahabhūsaṃprayuktakavipākahetvabhisandhivacanādadoṣaḥ eṣaḥ /	There is never a time when this dharma is not a cause. This text does not contradict the first; for the Jñānaprasthāna does not refer to that which is a cause in the quality of a similar cause, but rather that which is a cause in the qualities of sahabhūhetu, sanñprayuktakahetu, oṛ vipākahetu.

Hence, taking into account a future dharma in its last place, the Jīñānaprasthāna can say that there is never a time when the dharma is not a cause, that it is always a cause, since, at a certain moment in the future, it is a cause. This explanation does not resolve the difficulty.
tasyā yamaparihāro yasmātsa dharma utpadyamānāvasthāyāḥ pūrvaṃ sabhāgaheturabhūtvā paścāt bhavati /	In fact, if a future dharma, after not having been a cause becomes a cause by arriving at a state of arising, then it has not always been a cause but now the Jñānaprasthāna says absolutely that there is never a time when it is not a cause.
ihapi ca praśne yo dharmo yasya dharmasya samanantaraḥ kadācit sa dharmastasya dharmasya na samanantara iti śakyamanayā kalpanayā vaktuṃ syānna kadāciditi /	Furthermore, this explanation cannot be reconciled with the answer that the Jñānaprasthāna gives to another question, “Is there a period in which the dharma that is an immediately antecedent condition of a certain ḍharma is not samanantara?
kasmādevamāha /	Yes, when it has not yet arisen. ”Now the case of samanantara is analogous to that of sabhāgahetu: future samanantara, arriving at a state of arising, is samanantara.

Now the Jñānaprasthāna answers, “It is not samanantara when it has pot arisen.

One can answer the first question as the second, and the second as the first. What a singular process of explanation!

iṣyata evāvasthāṃ prati na dravyam /	but the thing itself, the dravya which is a certain sabhāgahetu, is not new. A future dharma is not sabhāgahetu, but once it has arisen, it becomes sabhāgahetx.
avasthāphalalṃ hi sāmargyaṃ na dravyaphalam /	In fact, the result of the complex of causes, is the condition of a thing and not the thing itself , the dharma. (A futurte dharma exists as a thing, dravyatas;

See v. It were sabhāgahetu, it would be mentioned as such in the Jñānaprasthāna. Now the Jūṣṇaprasthāṇa, answering the question, “What is sabhāgahetu? ” does not say that future roots of good are sabhāgaheta of future roots of good.

naitadasti / niḥṣyandaphalena hi saphalaḥ sabhāgahetuḥ / taccānāgatasyāyuktaṃ pūrvapaścimatā 'bhāvāt /	No, for the result of sabhāgahetu is an “out-flowing result of out-flowing,” a result similar to its cause, and this type of result does not suit a future dharma, because, in the future, there is no anteriority and posteriority.

Hence a future dharma is not a similar cause.
vipākaheturapi evamanāgato na prapnoti / vīpākaphalasya pūrvaṃ saha cāyogādanāgate cādhvati pūrvapaścimatā 'bhāvāt / naitadasti /	If this is the case, then a future dharma would no longer be a vipākahetu, a retributive cause, for a retributive result cannot be either simultaneous or anterior to its cause, and because future dharmas have no earlier or later periods of time, the cause is not the same. A similar cause and its out-flowing result are similar dharmas.

anāgamye dhyānāntarikāyāṃ caturṣuraneṣu triṣu cārūpyeṣu mārgasatyamanyo 'nyaṃ sabhāgahetuḥ /	The Path is of nine stages or spheres—the anāgamya, the dhyānāntara, the Four primary Dhyāṇnas, and the three inferior, ptimary Ārūpyas—in the sense that an ascetic, abiding in these nine states of absorption, can cultivate the Path. The ḍharmas that constitute the Path are similar causes of the dharmas that constitute the Path, frorn stage to stage. In fact, the Path resides in the different stages as a visitor, without forming part of the. Spheres of existence to which these stages belong are not on the Path. The Path, whatever be the stage upon which the ascetic relies in order to cultivate it, stays of the same nature; the Path is hence a similar cause of the Path.
kiṃ kāraṇam /	Nevertheless, the complete Path is not a similar cause of the complete Path.

The Path is sabhāgahetu to an eqnal or superior Path. Not of an inferior Path, because the Path is always acquired through effort.

samaviśiṣṭayoḥ sabhāgaheturbhavanti na nyūnasya /	The dharmas acquired through cultivation are sabhāgahetu of the same two classes, the equal and the higher. Worldly ḍharmas acquired through effort or exercise are sirnilar causes of equal or higher dharmas, but not of inferior dharmas.

The dharmas of hearing and of reflection do not exist in this sphere of existence. Furthermore, one must consider that the dharmas acquired through effort are of nine classes: weak-weak, medium-weak, etc. The weak-weak are the similar causes of dharmas of nine classes;

Furthermore, as a mind capable of creating fictive beings of the sphere of Kamadhātu can be the result of each of the Four Dhyanas, there is reason to establish here the same distinctions: the minds capable of creating fictive beings constitute four classes, and are, according to their class, similar causes of four, three, two, or one mind capable of creating fictive beings.

Once these principles have been established, the following questions are stated and resolved: 1. 1 is there a pure dharma, already arisen, which is not the cause of aPure dharma not destined to arise?

Retribution is not simultaneous to the action which produces it, for. A retributive result is not experienced at the moment when the action is accomplished.

tadbalena prāpteḥ / prāptireva tarhi mārgasya phalaṃ prāpnoti / tasyāmeva tasya sāmarthyānna visaṃyogaḥ /	It is the result of the Path, for it is obtained due to the force of the Path: in other words, it is through the Path that an ascetic obtains possession of disconnection. Hence it is the obtaining or the possession of disconnection which is the result of the Path, and not disconnection itself: for the Path is efficacious with regard to the obtaining of disconnection, but not with regard to disconnection.

The Sūtra declares that the hetus and the pratyayas which are capable of producing are impermanent.

sarvamevāsaṃskṛtamadravyamiti sautrāntikāḥ / nahi tadrūpavedanādiyat bhāvāntaramasti / kiṃ tarhi /	The Sautrāntikas affirm that the three types of unconditioned things are not real.
spraṣṭavyābhāvamātramākāśam /	The three dharmas that it refers to are not distinct and real entities like color, sensation, etc. What is called “space” is solely the absence of any tangible thing, that is, the absence of a resistant body.

utpannānuśayajanmanirodhaḥ pratisaṃkhyāvalenānyasyānutpādaḥ pratisaṃkhyānirodhaḥ /	What is called pratisanṁakhyānirodha or Nirvāṇa is—when both the defilements already produced and the existence already produced are destroyed—the absence of any other defilements or any other existence, and that by reason of the force of the consciousness. When independent of the force of consciousness.

For example, when premature death interrupts existence, there is apratisaṁkhyānirodha of the dharmas which would have arisen in the course of this existence if it had continued. According to another school, pratisaṁkhyānirodha is the future non-arising of the defilements by reason of consciousness;
yastu punaḥ duḥkhasyānutpādaḥ saḥ utpādakāraṇānuśayavaikalyādeveti na tasminprajñāyāḥ sāmarthyamastyato 'sāvapratisaṃkhyānirodha iti /	apratisamkhyānirodha is the future non-arising of suffering, that is, of existence, by reason of the disappearance of the defilements, and not directly by reason of consciousness.

ya evotpannasya paścādabhāvaḥ sa eva svarasa nirodhādapratisaṃkhyānirodha ityapare /	Another School defines apratisaṁkhyānirodha as “later nonexistence of the dharmas which have arisen” by virtue of their spontaneous destruction.
asyāṃ tu kalpanāyāmanityo 'pratisaṃkhyānirodhaḥ prāpnotyavinaṣṭe tadabhāvāt /	In this hypothesis, apratisamkhyānirodha would not be eternal, since it is non-existent as long as the dharma as cause has not perished. But does not pratisaṁkhyānirodha have a certain consciousness, the pratisamṁkhya, for its antecedent?
nanu ca pratisaṃkhyānirodho 'pyanityaḥ prāpnoti /	Consequently it too would not be eternal, for, if its antecedent were absent, its consequence would also be absent. You cannot say that pratisaṁkhyānirodha is not eternal because its antecedent is pratisaṁkhyā;
pratisaṃkhyāpūrvakatvāt /	in fact, it does not have pratisaṁkhyā for its antecedent.
na vai sa pratisaṃkhyāpūrvako nahi poūrvaṃ pratisaṃkhyā paścādanutpannānāmanutpādaḥ /	One cannot say that pratisaṁkhyā is earlier, or that the "no-arising of the non-arisen dharmas" is later.

vinā tu pratisaṃkhyayā ye dharmā utpatsyante tadutpannāyāṃ pratisaṃkhyāyāṃ punarnopapadyanta iti /	If pratisarkhyā is absent, the dharmas would arise; but if pratisaṁkhyā arises, the dharmas would absolutely not arise.
etadatra pratisaṃkhyāyā samarthyaṃ yadutākṛtotpattipratibandhānāmutpattipratibandhabhāvaḥ /	The efficacy of pratisamṁkhyā with regard to their non-arising consists in this: 1) that before pratisaṁkhyā, there is no obstacle to their arising;

If Nirvāga is simply non-arising, how does one explain the Sūtra which says, “The cultivation of the five faculties,; —faith, etc,--has for its result the abandoning of past, present, and future suffering”?
prahāṇaṃ hi nirvāṇamanāgatasyaiva cānutpādo nātītapratyutpannasyete / astyetadevam /	In fact, this abandoning is nothing other than Nirvāṇa, and there can only be non-arising of a future dharma, not of a past or present dharma. This Sūtra does not contradict our definition of Nirvāṇa.
kiṃ tu tadālambanakleśaprahāṇāt duḥkhasya prahāṇamuktaṃ bhagavatā “yo rūpe cchandarāgastaṃ prajahīta /	In fact, “the abandoning of past and present suffering” means the abandoning of the defilements bearing past and present suffering. Our interpretation is justified by another text which says, “Abandon desire relative to rāpa, to sensation, and to consciousness.
cchandarāge prahīṇe evaṃ vastadrūpaṃ prahīṇaṃ bhaviṣyati pārijñātaṃ vistareṇa yāvad vijñānami“ti /	When desire is abandoned, rāpa, and consciousness will be abandoned and comprehended by you.”
evaṃ traiyadhvikasyāpi duḥkhasya prahāṇaṃ yujyate /	It is in this manner that we should understand “the abandoning of past and present suffering” of which the Sūtra speaks when it speaks of the faculties.
athāpyatītānāgatapratyutpannasya kleśasya prahāṇāyetyucyeta /	The cultivation of the faculties has for its result the abandoning of past, present, and future defilements, the explanation is the same.
atrāpyeṣa nayaḥ / athavā 'yamabhiprāyo bhavedatītaḥ kleśaḥ paurvajanmikaḥ pratyutpannaḥ kleśa aihajanmiko	Or rather, past defilement is the defilement of a previous existence; present defilement is the defilement of the present existence; these do not refer to the defilement of a given past or present moment.
yathā tṛṣṇā vicariteṣvaṣṭādaśa tṛṣṇāvicaritānyatītamadhvānamupādāyetyatītaṃ janmādhikṛtyoktamevaṃ yāvat pratyutpannam /	The same for the eighteen r̥ṣṇāvicaritas or modes of thirst: the modes that are related to a past existence are called past modes, those that are related to a present existence are called present modes, and those thar are related to a future existence are called future modes.

How can a dharma which does not exist be the best among the dharmas which do not exist?

This non-existent thing is the most distinguished of all non-existent things. The Śūtra praises it by saying that it.

What should we understand by “Noble Truth” or ārayasatya? Without doubt the sense of sa$ya is “not incorrect” The Āryans see that which exists and that which does not exist in a not incorrect manner: in that which is suffering, they see only suffering, and in the non-existence of suffering, they see the non-existence of suffering. What contradiction do you find between the non-existence of suffeting and pratisaṁkhyānirodha being a Truth?
ustaṃ yathāryasatyaṃ dvitīyasyānantaraṃ dṛṣṭamuddṛṣṭaṃ ceti tṛtīyaṃ bhavati /	And this non-existence is the Third Truth, because the Āryans see it and proclaim it imrmmediately after the Second Truth.

devatā enaṃ pālayiṣyanti pālanīyaṃ cet maṃsyate /	May the gods be charged with defending this doctrine, if they judge that it is possible!
abhūtaṃ tu parikalpitaṃ syāt / kiṃ kāraṇam /	But to maintain the existence of unconditioned things in and of themselves is to affirm a non-existent thing to be real.
nahi tasya rūpavedanādivat svabhāva upalabhyate nacāpi cakṣurādivatkarma /	In fact, unconditioned things are not known through direct perception, as is the case for physical matter, sensation, etc. ; and they are not known through inference, by reason of their activity, as is the case for the sense organs. Furthermore, if nirvana or extinction is a thing in and of itself, how do you justify the genitive, dukkhasya nirodhaḥ, "the extinction of suffering," as the extinction of the defilement, or the extinction of the object of defilement?
amuṣya ca vastuno 'yaṃ nirogha iti ṣaṣṭhīvyavasthā kathaṃ prakalpyate /	In our system, the extinction of a thing is simply the non-existence of this thing. "Extinction of suffering" means that "suffering will not exist any more.

bhāvāntaratve 'pi yasya kleśasya prāptivicchedāydyo nirodhaḥ prāpyate sa tasyeti vyavadiśyate /	Yet we can specify extinction as being in a relationship with such things, for one takes possession of extinction at the moment when one cuts off the possession of a certain thing.
tasya tarhi prāptiniyame ko hetuḥ /	But we would answer, what is it that determines or specifies the taking of possession of extinction?
“dṛṣṭadharmanirvāṇaprāpto bhikṣuri“tyuktaṃ sūtre /	The Sutra speaks of the Bhiksu who has obtained Nirvana in this life.

pratipakṣalābhena kleśapunarbhavotpādātyantaviruddhāśraya lābhāt prāptaṃ nirvāṇamityucyate /	The Bhiksu, through the possession of the adverse force of the antidote, that is, through the possession of the Path, has obtained a personality contrary to the defilements, and contrary to a new existence. This is why the Sutra says that he has obtained Nirvana. Moreover we have a text that shows that Nirvana is pure non-existence.

I do not see that the locative “in Nirvana” has any force to establish that Nirvana is a thing.

“pradyotasyeva nirvāṇaṃ vimokṣastasya cetasa” iti /	If this means asmin prapta, “Nirvana has been obtained,” you would have to admit that future suffering will not appear while the Path—by virtue of which youConsequently the comparison of the Sūtra is excellent, “The deliverance of his mind is like the Nirvāṇa of a flame.

vipākaphalamantyasya	Retribution is the result of the last cause.
vipākaheturantye 'bhihitatvāt antyaḥ /	The last cause is the retributive cause, vépākahetu, because the retributive cause is named last in this list.
tasya vipākaphalam /	The first result, vápākaphala, is the result of this cause.
pūrvasyādhipataṃ phalam /	The predominating result is the result of the first.
kāraṇahetuḥ pūrvamuktatvāt pūrvaḥ /	The first cause is kāraṇahetu or reason for being;
tasyādhipajaṃ phalam /	the last result proceeds from it. This result is called adhipaja, arisen from predominance, or adhipata, belonging to predominance, because it is the result of the predominating cause. The kāraṇahetu is considered as playing the role of a master. But, we say, the quality of not creating an obstacle suffices to constitute kāraṇahetu.
anāvaraṇabhāvamātreṇāvasthitasya kimādhipatyam /	How can one regard it as a “predominating cause? ” Kāranahetu is either a “non-efficacious cause” and one then regards it as predominant because it creates no obstacle;
etadeva aṅgībhāvo 'pi cāsti kāraṇahetostadyathā “pañcasu vijñānakāyeṣudaśānāmāyatanānāṃ bhājanaloke ca karmaṇām /	or an “efficacious cause,” and one then regards it as predominant because it possesses mastery, a predominating and generating activity. For example, the ten āyatanas are predominant with regard to the five sense consciousnesses; the collective action of living beings is predominant with regard to the physical world.
śrotrādīnāmapyasti cakṣurvijñānotpattau pāraṃparyeṇādhipatyam /	The organ of hearing exercises an indirect predominance with regard to the visual consciousness, for.

sabhāga sarvatragayorniṣyandaḥ sadṛśaphalatvādanayorniḥṣyandaphalam /	An outflowing result proceeds from sabhagahetu and from servatragahetu: for the result of these two causes is similar to its causes.
pauruṣaṃ dvayoḥ //	The parusa or virile result is the result of two causes.
sahabhūsaṃprayuktakahetvoḥ puruṣakāraphalam /	The result of sabhagahetu and saprayuktakahetu is called praurusa or virile, that is, the result of purusakara or virile activity.
puruṣabhāvavyatirekāt puruṣakāraḥ puruṣaṃ eva /	Purusakara or virile activity is not distinct from the person himself, for action is not distinct from him who accomplished the action.
tasya phalaṃ pauruṣam /	The result of virile activity can thus be termed the virile result.
ko 'yaṃ puruṣakāro nāma /	What do we understand by "virile activity?
yasya dharmasya yat kāritram / puruṣakāra iva hi puruṣakāraḥ /	" The activity of a dharma is termed its virile activity, because it is similar to the activity of a person.
tadyathā kākajaṅghā oṣadhirmattahastī manuṣya iti /	In the same way, in the world, a certain plant is called kakajangha, because it resembles the foot of a crow;
kimanyeṣāmapyasti puruṣakāraphāmutāho dvayoreva /	heroes are called natahastin, because theyAccording to one opinion, all other causes have this type of result, with the exception of retrbbutive causes.
anyeṣāmapyastyanyatra vipākahetoḥ / yasmātsahotpannaṃ vā samanantarotpannaṃ vā puruṣakāraphalaṃ bhavati /	This result is, in fact, either simultaneous to, or immediately following its cause;
na caivaṃ vipākaḥ /	but such is not the case with a retributive result. According to other Masters, a retributive cause also distantly results in virile activity, for example the fruits reaped by a laborer.
tasyāpyasti viprakṛṣṭapuruṣakāraphalam / yathā karṣakāṇāṃ sasyamityapare /	Niṣyandaphala arises similar to its cause, Puruṣakāraphala arises through the force of its cause, and Adhipatiphaa arises by reason of the nonobstacle of its cause.

vipāko 'vyākṛto dharmaḥ /	Retribution is a neutral dharma.
anivṛtāvyākṛto hi dharmaḥ vipākaḥ /	Retribution is an undefiled, neutral dharma. Among the undefiled, neutral dharmas, some belong to living beings, while others do not belong to living beings.
asattvākhyo 'pi syādata āha /	Consequently the author specifies.
sattvākhyaḥ	Some of those dharmas belonging to living beings are said to be of accumulation and some are said to be of an outflowing.
aupacayiko 'pi syāt naiḥṣyandiko 'pyat āha / vyākṛtodbhavaḥ /	Consequently the author specifies that they arise later than a non-neutral dharrna.
kuśalākuśalaṃ hi vipākaṃ prati vyākaraṇādvyākṛtam /	A non-neutral action is called this because it produces retribution; non-neutral actions are bad actions and good-impure actions.
tasmādya utarakālaṃ bhavati na saha nāntaraṃ sa vipākaḥ / etadvipākasya lakṣaṇam /	From actions of this nature there arises later, the result that one terms "retributive result" or "matured result". Why not consider the dharmas that do not form part of living beings, mountains, rivers, etc, as retributive results?
kasmādasattvākhyo 'rthaḥ karmajo na vipākaḥ / sādhāraṇatvāt /	Do they not arise from good or bad actions?
anyo 'pi hi tattathaiva paribhoktuṃ samarthaḥ /	The dharmas that do not form part of living beings are, by nature, common in that everyone may partake of them. Now retributive results, by definition, are unique: another person never experiences the.
asādhāraṇastu vipākaḥ /	Tributive results of actions that I accomplish.
nahyanyakṛtasya karmaṇo 'nyo vipākaṃ pratisaṃvedayate / adhipatiphalaṃ kasmāt pratisaṃvedayate / sādhāraṇakarmasaṃbhūtatvāt /	Action produces a predominating result in addition to a retributive result: all beings experience this result in common, because the collectivity of their actions cooperate in their creation.
niḥṣyando hetusadṛśaḥ /	A result that resembles its cause is called outflowing.
hetoryaḥ sadṛśo dharmaḥ sa niṣyandaphalam /	A dharma resembling its cause is an outflowing result.
tadyathā sabhāgasarvatragahetvoḥ /	Two causes, the similar cause and the universal cause produce an outflowing result.
yadi sarvatragahetorapi samānaṃ phalaṃ kasmānna sabhāgahetoreveṣyate /	If the result of the universal cause is an outflowing result, a result similar to its cause, why not give the universal cause the name of similar cause? A result of a universal cause is always similar to its cause from the point of view of the stage: like it, it belongs to Kāmadhātu, etc. ;
yasmāt bhūmitaḥ kliṣṭatayā cāsya sādṛśyaṃ natu prakārataḥ /	and from the point of view of its moral character: like it, it is defiled. But it can belong to a different category than the category of its cause. Category means the method of abandoning; it is susceptible of being abandoned by Seeing the Truth of Suffering, etc. When. There is a similarity between a cause and its result.

caturthyatānākārānsthāpayitveti /	Four alternative cases present themselves. A similar cause which is not a universal cause, for example, a non-universal defilement related to the defilements of their own category. A universal cause which is not a similar cause, the universal defilements related to a defilement of another category. A universal cause which is also a similar cause, the universal defilements related to a defilement of their own category. All other dharmas are neither similar causes nor universal causes.
visaṃyogaḥ kṣayo dhiyā // kṣayo nirodhaḥ / dhīḥ prajñā /	Extinction through intelligence is disconnection.
tenā pratisaṃkhyā nirodho visaṃyogaphalamityuktaṃ bhavati /	Disconnection or visaṁyogaphala, "result that consists of disconnection" is extinction obtained by the speculative consciousness. Visaṁyogaphala is hence pratisaṁkhyānirodha.
yadvalājjāyate yattatphalaṃ puruṣakārajam /	Ā dharma is the result of the virile activity of the dharma through the force by which it arises. This refers to a conditioned dharma.
tadyathā adharabhūmikasya prayogacittasyoparibhūmikaḥ samādhiḥ sāsravasyānāsravo dhyānacittasya nirmāṇacittamityevamādi /	The absorption of the First Dhyāna is the result of the virile activity of a mind in Kāmadhātu which instigates it or prepares it; the absorption of the Second Dhyāna is the result of the virile activity of a mind in the First Dhyāna. A pure dharma can be the result of the virile activity of an impure dharma. ṢV E A mind that can create fictive beings is the result of the virile activity of a mind in a Dhyāna. And thus following.
pratisaṃkhyānirodhastu yadvalāt prāpyata iti vaktavyam /	Pratisaṁkhyāṇirodha or Nirvāṇa is considered to be a “result of virile activity; ” now the definition given inKārikā does not apply to mirodha which, being eternal, does not arise.
apūrvaḥ saṃskṛtasyaiva saṃskṛto 'dhipateḥ phalam //	We say then that it is the result of the virile activity of the dharma by the force of which one obtains possession of it.
pūrvotpannādanyaḥ saṃskṛto dharmaḥ saṃskṛtasyaiva sarvasyādhipatiphalam /	Any conditioned dharma is the predominating result of conditioned dharmas, with the exception of the dharmas that are later than it.

kartuḥ puruṣakāraphalam / akarturapyadhipatiphalam /	the second refers to both the agent and the non-agent.
tadyathā śilpini śilpaṃ puruṣakāraphalamadhipatiphalaṃ ca /	For example, a created thing is the result of the virile activity and the predominating result of the artisan who created it;
anyeṣāmadhipatiphalameva /	it is only the predominating result of what is not the artisan.
athaiṣāṃ hetūnāṃ katammo hetuḥ kasminkāle phalaṃ pratigṛhṇāti dadāti vā /	In what condition —the past, present, or future—is each of the causes found when they grasp and when they produce their result? What is understood by “grasping a result” and "“producing a result?” A dharma grasps a result when it becomes its seed. A dharma produces a result at the moment when it gives this result the power of arising; that is, at the moment when, the future result being turned towards arising or is ready to arise, this dharma gives it the power that causes it to enter into the present.
vartamānāḥ phalaṃ pañca gṛhṇanti	Five causes grasp their result in the present. Five causes grasp their results only when they are in the present: in the past, they have already grasped their results;
nātītāḥḥ pratigṛhītatvānnāpyanāgatā niṣpuruṣakāratvāt /	in the future, they have no activity.
kāraṇaheturapyevam /	The same holds for kāraṇahetu;
sa tu nāvaśyaṃ saphala iti nocyate /	but the stanza does not mention it, because kāraṇahetu does not necessarily have a result.
dvau prayacchataḥ / sahabhūsaṃprayuktakahetū varttamānau phalaṃ prayacchataḥ /	Two produce their result in the present.
samānakālameva hyanayeḥ phaladānagrahaṇam /	The mutually coexistent cause and the associated cause produce their results only when they are in the present: these two causes in fact grasp and produce their results at the same time.
varttamānābhyatītau dvau phalaṃ prayacchataḥ sabhāgasarvatragahetū / yuktaṃ tāvadyadatītāviti /	Two produce their results in both the past and the present. The similar cause and the universal cause produce their results both when they are in the present and when they are in the past.
atha kathaṃ varttamānau niṣyandaphalaṃ prayacchataḥ /	How can they produce their outflowing results when they are in the present? We have seen that they are earlier than their results.
samanantaranivarttanāt / nivṛtte tu phale tau cābhyatītau bhavataḥ /	One says that they produce their results in the present, because they produce them immediately.
phalaṃ cāpi dattaṃ na punastadeva dattaḥ /	When their result has arisen, they are past: they have already produced it; they do not produce the same. It happens that, at a given moment, a good similar cause grasps a result but does not produce a result.
asti kuśalaḥ sabhāgahetuḥ phalaṃ pratigṛhṇāti na dadātīti catuṣkoṭikaḥ /	Four alternatives: to grasp, to produce, to grasp and to produce, and to neither grasp nor to produce. The possession of the roots of good that the person who has cut off the roots of good abandons at the last moment, grasps a result, but does not produce a result.
prathamā koṭiḥ kuśalamūlāni samucchindan yāḥ prāptīḥ sarvapaścādvijahāti /	The possession of the roots of good that the person who again takes up the roots of good acquires in the first moment, produces a result, but does not grasp a result. We must say: ‘This same possession, the possession abandoned at the last moment by the person who has cut off the roots of good, produces its result, but does not grasp it at the moment when this person again takes up the roots of good. The possession of the person whose roots of good are not cut off - with the exception of the two proceeding cases: that of the person who has achieved cutting them off, and that of the person who.
dvitīyā kuśalamūlāni pratisaṃdadhāno yāḥ sarvaprathamaṃ pratilabhate / evaṃ tu vaktavyam /	Again takes up the roots of good—both grasp and produce.
syāttā eva pratisaṃdadhānasya tṛtīyā asamucchinnakuśalamūlasya śeṣāsvavasthāsu / caturthyatānākārān sthāpayitvā /	In all other cases, possession neither grasps nor produces: for example, the possession of the roots of good of a person whose roots of good are cat off; the possession of the roots of good of a superior stage by a person who has fallen from this stage: these possessions have already grasped their result, and hence do not grasp it any more; , they do not produce it, since the person cannot have possession of these roots at the present time. The Vibhāṣā establishes the same alternatives with respect to bad similar causes:
akuśalasya tu prathamā koṭiḥ /	The possession of the bad dharmar that a person who obtains detachment from desire abandons at the last moment.
kāmavairāgyamanuprāpnuvan yāḥ prāptīḥ sarvapaścādvijahāti dvitīyā kāmavairāgyāt parihīyamāṇo yāḥ sarvaprathamaṃ pratilabhate /	The possession that a person who fell from detachment acquires in the first moment.
evaṃ tu vaktavyam / syāttā eva parihīyamāṇasya /	We must say: These same possessions, when a person falls from detachment.
tṛtīyā kāmāvītarāgasya śeṣāsvavasthāsu /	The possession of a person who is not detached, with the exception of the two preceding cases. Possession in all other cases: for example the possession of a.
caturthyatānākārān sthāpayitvā /	There are also four alternatives regarding defiled-neutral similar causes: The last possession of defiled-neutral dharmas that the saint who becomes an Arhat abandons. The first possession that a fallen Arhat acquires.
evaṃ nivṛtāvyākṛtasyāpyarhattvaprāptiparihāṇito yathāyogaṃ yojyam /	Or better: the aforementioned possession of an Arhat who has fallen.
anivṛtāvyākṛtasya paścātpādakaḥ /	The possession of a non-detached person in Bhavāgra, the two preceding cases being excluded.
yāstāvat dadāti pratigṛhṇātyapi saḥ / syāt pratigṛhṇāti na dadātyarhataścaramāḥ skndhāḥ / sālambananiyamena tu kṣaṇaśaḥ /	Possession in all other cases: the possession of an Arhat.
kuśalaḥ sabhāgahetuḥ phalaṃ pratigṛhlāti na dadātīti /	When an undefiled-neutral similar cause produces its result, it grasps it, but it can grasp its result without producing it: for example, in the case of the last séandhas of an Arhat which have no outflowing. We have up to now considered the dharmas that are not “subject to consciousness”. If we consider the mind and its mental states in their successive moments, we can establish the four following alternatives for good similar causes:
catuṣkokṭikaḥ /	It grasps but does not produce.
prathamā koṭiḥ kuśalacittānantaraṃ kliṣṭamavyākṛtaṃ vā cittaṃ saṃmukhīkarotīti /	When a good mind isImmediately followed by a defiled or undefiled-neutral mind, this good mind, as a similar cause, grasps, that is, projects an outflowing result, namely a good future mind, which is or is not destined to arise;
dvitīyā viparyayāt /	it does not produce an outflowing result, since the mind that follows it, defiled or undefiled-neutral, is not the outflowing of a good mind. It produces but does not grasp.
tṛtīyā kuśalacittānantaraṃ kuśalameva /	When a good mind immediately follows a defiled or undefiled-neutral mind, a good earlier mind produces an outflowing result, namely the good mind that we have just considered; this earlier mind does not grasp a result, since it grasped it formerly.
caturthyatānākārān sthāpayitvā /	It grasps and it produces. Two good minds follow one another, the first grasping and producing an outflowing result, which is the second mind. It neither grasps nor produces. When defiled or undefiled-neutral minds succeed one another, the earlier good mind, as a similar cause, formerly grasped its result and shall later produce its result; but for an instant it neither grasps nor produces.
evamakuśalādayo 'pi yojyāḥ / kathaṃ punaḥ phalaṃ pratigṛhītaṃ bhavati /	We can in like manner establish the alternatives regarding bad similar causes.
tasya bījabhāvopagamāt / eko 'tītaḥ prayacchati // vipākaheturatīta eva phalaṃ prayacchati /	One cause produces its result in the past.
yasmānna saha vā samanantaro vā 'sti vipākaḥ /	The retributive cause produces its result when it is in the past, for this result is not simultaneous to, nor immediately following its cause.
punaranye caturvidhaṃ phalamāhuḥ /	Some other Masters say that there are four results different from the five results that we have just mentioned. These four are: L.
pratiṣṭhāphalam / yathā jalamaṇḍalaṃ vāyumaṇḍalasya yāvattṛṇādayaḥ pṛthivyāḥ /	pratiṣṭhāphala, a base result: a circle of water is the result of the circle of wind and thus following to plants;
prayogaphalam /	which are the result of earth;
yathā 'śubhāyā yāvadanutpādajñānam /	prayogaphala, a result of preparatory exercise: anutpādajñāna, etc. is the result of ś¥bhā, etc. ;
sāmagrīphalam / yathā cakṣurādīnāṃ cakṣurvijñānādīni /	sāmagrīphala, a result of a complex: the visual consciousness is the result of the organ of sight, of a visible thing, of light and of an act of attention ;
bhāvanāphalam / yathā rūpāvacarasya cittasya nirmāṇam /	bhāvaṇṉāphala, a result of meditation: a mind capable of creating fictive beings is the result of a Dhyāṇna.
etattu puruṣakārādhipatiphalayorantarbhūtam /	The first of these four results is.
uktā hetavaḥ phalāni ca //	We have explained causes and results.
tatra katame dharmāḥ katibhiḥ hetubhirutpadyanta ityāha samāsata ime caturvidhā dharmāstadyathā kliṣṭā dharmā vipākajāḥ prathamānāsravāstebhyaśca śeṣāḥ /	We must now examine how many causes produce the different dharrnas. From this point of view, the dharmas are ranged into four categories: defiled dharmas, that is, the defilements, the dharmas associated with a defilement, and the dbarmas having their origins in a defilement; retributive dharmas or dharmas arisen from a retributive cause; the first pure dharmas, that is, dáuḥkhe dharmajñánakṣānti and the dharmas coexistent with this &ṣānti, and the other dharmas, that is, the neutral dharmuas, with the exception of the dharmas of retribution, and the good dharmas, with the exception of the first pure dharṇas. The mind and its mental states are: defiled; arisen from a retributive cause;
ke punaḥ śeṣāḥ /	others;
vipākavarjyāḥ avyākṛtāḥ prathamānāsravakṣaṇavarjyāśca kuśalā iti / ete caturvidhā dharmāḥ / kliṣṭā vipākajāḥ śeṣāḥ prathamāryā yathākramam / vipākaṃ sarvagaṃ hitvā tau sabhāgaṃ ca śeṣajāḥ //	and pure for the first time, arising from causes that remain when one excludes, in this order, the retributive cause, the universal cause.
kliṣṭā dharmā vipākahetuṃ hitvā śeṣebhyaḥ pañcabhyo jāyante /	The mind and its mental states, when they are defiled, arise from five causes excluding the retributive cause;
vipākajā sarvatragahetuṃ hetvā śeṣebhyaḥ pañcabhya eva /	when they are retributive, they arise from five causes with the exclusion of the universal cause;
śeṣā dharmāstau vipākasarvatragahetū hitvā śeṣebhyaścaturbhryo jāyante /	when they are different from these two categories and from the fourth, they arise from four causes, with the exclusion of the retributive cause and the universal cause;

prayuktakahetunaikena varjitāḥ anye 'pi kliṣṭādayo dharmāstathaivotpadyante yathā cittacaīttāḥ / tatra kliṣṭāścatubhryo vipākajāśca /	The dharmas that are not mind or mental states, namely the material dharmas and the saṁskāras not associated with the mind, accordingly as they fall into one of four categories, arising from causes proper to this category with the exclusion of the associated causes are: defiled and retributive, four causes;
śeṣāstribhyaḥ prathamānāsravā dvābhyām /	different, three causes. Pure for the first time, two causes.

catvāraḥ pratyayā uktāḥ	The pratyayas are said to be four.
kvavoktāḥ /	Where is this said?
sūtre / “catasraḥ pratyayatāḥ / hetupratyayatā samanantarapratyayatā ālambanapratyayatā adhipatipratyayatā ce“ti /	In the Sūtra, it says “There are four conditions, namely causes as a condition, an equal and immediately antecedent condition, an object as condition, and a predominating influence as condition.”
pratyayajātiḥ pratyayatā /	Pratyayaṭā means. “a type of pratyaya.” What is “cause as a condition”?
tatra hetvākhyaḥ pañca hetavaḥ //	The pratyaya that bears the name of hetu is five hetus.
kāraṇahetuvarjyāḥ paṇyca hetavo hetupratyayaḥ /	Excepting kāraṇahetu, the five remaining herus constitute hetnpratyayatā, causes as condition. What is “an equal and immediately antecedent condition”?
cittacaittā acaramā utpannāḥ samanantaraḥ /	The mind and its mental states that have arisen, with the exception of the last ones, are an equal and immediately antecedent condition. If one excepts the last mind and the last mental states of the Arhat at the moment of Nirvāṇa, all minds and mental states which have.
arhataḥ paścimānapāsyotpannāścittacaittāḥ samanantarapratyayaḥ /	Only mind and mental states are equal and immediately antecedent conditions. Of what dharmas are they the equal and immediately antecedent conditions?
samaścāyamanantaraśca pratyaya iti samanantarapratyayaḥ /	This type of condition is called samanantara because it produces equal and immediate dharmas. The prefix sarn is understood in the sense of equality. Consequently orily minds and their mental states are equal and immediately antecedent conditions, for there is no equality between a cause and its result with respect to the other dharṁas, for example the material dharmas. In fact, after a rūpa of the sphere of Kāmadhātu, there can arise at the same time two rūpar, one of Kāmadhātu, the other from Rūpadhātu, oṟ two r%pas, one from Kāmadhātu, the otheṛ pure; whereas one mind in Kāmadhātu and one mind in Rūpadhātu can never arise at the same time after a mind in Kāmadhātu. The appearance of the rāpar is confused: now an equal and immediately antecedent condition does not produce confused. Vasumitra says: A second rūpa of accumulation can arise in the ṣame body, without which the series of a rupa of accumulation would be broken;
ata eva rūpaṃ na samanantarapratyayo viṣamotpatteḥ /	hence rupa is not an equal and immediately antecedent condition.
tathāhi kāmāvacarasya rūpasyānantaraṃ kadācit kāmāvacaraṃ rūpāvacaraṃ cāvijñaptirūpamutpadyate kadācitkāmāvacaraṃ cānāsravaṃ ceti vyākulo rūpasaṃmukhībhāvaḥ avyākulastu samanantarapratyayaḥ aniruddha evaikasminnaupa cayikarūpasantāne dvitīyotpatteriti bhadantavasumitraḥ /	The Bhadanta says: A rupa dharma is immediately followed by more or by less. Hence it is not an equal and immediately antecedent condition.

nanu cāsti caittānā mapyalpabahutarotpattiḥ /	More arises from less: as when a small seed produces the roots of a fig tree, its trunk, its branches, and its leaves. When minds immediately succeed one another, do they always admit the same number of types of associated mental states? The earlier mind admits of a larger number of types of mental states, and the following mind, a lesser number; and vice versa.
kuśalākuśalāvyākṛteṣu cittesu savitarkasavicārādau ca samādhitraye /	Minds, good, bad, or neutral, succeed one another; but they do not admit of the same number of associated mental states. Hence there is no equality for the mental states as well as for the material dharmas. That is true;

nahi kadācidvahutarā vedanotpadyate saṃjñādayo vā /	There is never any inequality with respect to a determined type: more numerous sensations never arise after less numerous sensations, nor vice versa; this means that a mind accompanied by a single sensation is never followed by a mind associated with two or three sensations. The same for ideas and the other mental states. ‘Thus is it only in relation to its own type that an earlier mental state is an equal and immediately antecedent condition of a later mental state?

In a general way the earlier mental states are equal and immediately antecedent conditions of the mental states that follow.
santānasabhāgikāstu manyante “svajātereva samanantarapratyayaḥ /	But there is no succession from less to more with respect to one type, and vice versa: this justifies the expression sramanantara, “equal and immediate.”
tadyathā cittaṃ cittasyaiva vedanā vedanāyā eve“ti vistaraḥ /	The Ābhidhārmikas who take the name of Sāṁtāṇasabhāgīkas maintain on the contrary that a dharma of a certain type is only an equal and immediately antecedent condition of a dharma of that same type: mind arises from mind, sensation arises from seṇsation, etc. In this hypothesis, when a defiled dharma arises after an undefiled dharma, this defiled dharma does not proceed from an equal and immediately antecedent condition.
yadā tvakliṣṭāntaraṃ kliṣṭamutpadyate tasya kleśasya pūrvaniruddhaḥ kleśaḥ samanantarapratyayastadyathā nirodhasamāpatticittaṃ vyutthānacittasyeti	It is a previously destroyed defilement that is the equal and immediately antecedent condition of the defilement that defiles this second dharma. The previous defilement is considered as immediately preceeding the later defilement, even though it is separated by an undefiled dharma, separation by a dharma of a different nature does not constitute separation, as the leaving-mind of the absorption.
tadetanna vatsryate / prathamānāsravacittānutpattiprasaṅgat cittaviprayuktā api saṃskārāḥ /	We think that the theory of the Sāṁtānasabhāgikas is inadmissible, for, in this theory, a pure mind produced for the first time would not have any equal and immediately antecedent condition.
ata eva vyākulasaṃmukhībhāvānna samanantarapratyayastraivātukāpratisaṃyuktānāṃ yugapat saṃmukhībhāvāt /	The saṅskāras dissociated from the mind, like the material dharnas, are produced disparately: hence they are not equal and immediately antecedent conditions. In fact after possession in the sphere of Kāmadhātu, possession relative to the dharvmas of the three spheres of existence and to pure dharmas etc. , can be produced at the same time.

evaṃ tarhi bhagavān pūrvāntamadṛṣṭvā 'parāntaṃ na jānīyāt /	To believe you, if the Blessed One does not consider the past, then he does not know the future. Hence he is not omniscient.

The Sautrantikas: If this is the case, then the Blessed One would be an interpreter of signs;

“acintyo hi buddhānāṃ buddhiviṣaya” ityuktaṃ bhagavatā /	This is the opinion of the Sautrantikas, justified by the word of the Blessed One "The qualities of the Buddhas, the spheres of the Buddhas, are incomprehensible.

kasmādarhataścaramāścittacaittā na samanantarapratyayaḥ /	Why are the last mind and the last mental states of the Arhat equal and immediately antecedent conditions?
anyacittāsaṃbandhanāt /	Because no mind or mental states arise after them. But you have said that the anas is the mind that is disappearing and which serves as the support of the following mind.
nanu caivaṃ samanantaraniruddhaṃ cittaṃ mano bhavatītyanantara vijñānābhāvāt mano 'pi caramaṃ cittaṃ na prāpnoti /	Since no mind follows the last mind of an Arhat, this last mind should not receive either the name of %anas, or the name of equal and immediately antecedent condition; and yet you consider it as being ṁmanas. The case is not the same.
āśrayabhāvapratibhāvitaṃ mano na kāritraprabhāvitamityastyevāśrayabhāvaḥ /	That which constitutes the anṇas is not its activity, the fact of supporting the subsequent mind; rather, it is the quality of being a support for this mind; whether his (latter mind) arises or does not arise is of little importance. The last mind of.
kāraṇāntaravaikalyāttu vijñānāntaraṃ notpadyata iti /	if a subsequent mind, which would be supported by this support, does not arise, it is through the lack of other causes necessary to its arising. On the contrary, what constitutes an equal and immediately antecedent condition is its activity.

Hence the last mind of an Arhat is justly called maṇas, but not an equal and immediately antecedent condition.

anālambyamāno 'pi tathālakṣaṇatvād / yathā 'nidhyamānamapīndhanamucyate kāṣṭhādikaṃ tathālakṣāṇatvāditi /	This means that even if a visible object is not grasped as an object by the visual consciousness, it is an object, for, whether it is grasped or not grasped as an object, its nature remains the same, as fuel is combustible, even when it is not on fire. We can establish a threefold determination in considering the problem fror the point of view of the mind that grasps a dharma as its object.
ta ete cittacaitā dharmā āyatanadravyalakṣaṇaniyamenālambane yathāsvaṃ niyatāḥ / kimāśrayaniyamenāpi niyatāḥ / omityāha /	The mind is determined 1) with regard to its āyakana: for example, a visual consciousness is supported only on a visible thing ; 2) with regard to the dravya or substantial thing; aCertain visual consciousness is supported by colors such as blue and red.

nirudhyamānaṃ nāma varktamānam /	“Perishing” means “of the present.

tatra sahabhūsaṃprayuktakahetu kāritraṃ kurutaḥ / sahotpanne 'pi phale tayorvyāpāraḥ /	Sahabhūbhetu and saṁprayuktakahetu operate with regard to a present dharma, because they operate with regard to a dharma that arises at the same time as they do.
trayaḥ / jāyamāne	Three, with regard to an arising dharma.
jāyamānaṃ nāmānāgatamutpādābhimukham /	“An arising dharma” means a future dharma, because a future dharma, not having arisen, is ṭurned towards arising.

They arise successively by virtue of the desires of God, who says, “May this arise now! May this perish now!

teṣāmapi ca kramotpattau kāraṇāntarabhedāpekṣaṇādanavasthāprasaṅga syādityanantarabhedāyāḥ	And the causes that God takes into account are produced successively: they depend then on causes which are themselves dependent on other causes: an infinite regression. It is admitted that the series of causes has no beginning.
kāraṇaparaṃparāyā anāditvābhyupagamādayamīśvarakāraṇādhimuktaḥ śākyayūrvīyameva nyāyaṃ nātivṛttaḥ syāt /	This would admit that sa/sára does not have an origin. You then abandon the doctrine of a single cause and return to the Buddhist theory of causes and conditions.
yogapadye 'pīśvaracchandānāṃ jagato na yaugapadyam /	The desires of God are simuitaneous, but things do not arise at the same time because they arise as God wishes them to ariṣe, that is, in succession. This is inadtmissible. The desires of God remain what they are. Let us explain.

ekaṃ khalvapi jagataḥ kāraṇaṃ parigṛhṇatā 'nyeṣāmarthānāṃ pratyakṣaḥ puruṣakāro nihgṛhṇtaḥ syāt /	The followers of God, the single cause of the world, deny visible causes,—causes and conditions,—the efficacy of the seed with regard to. If modifying their position, they admit the existence of these causes, and pretend that these causes serve God as auxiliaries, this then is no more than a pious affirmation, for we do not maintain any activity of a cause besides the activity of the so-called secondary causes.
sahāpi ca kāraṇaiḥ kāraka mīśvaraṃ kalpayatā kevalo bhaktivādaḥ syat /	Furthermore, God would not be sovereign with regard to auxiliary causes, since these cooperate in the production of the effect through their own efficacy.

tasyāpyanyānapekṣatvādīśvaravadanāditvaprasaṅga / evaṃ pradhāne 'pi yathāyogaṃ vācyam /	We would refute the doctrine of Puruṣa, of Pradhāna, etc. , as we have refuted the theist doctrine, mutatis mutandis.
tasmānna lokasyaikaṃ kāraṇamasti /	Thus, no dharma arises from a single cause. Alas, persons are unclear! Like the birds and the animals, truly.
svānyevaiṣāṃ karmāṇi tasyāṃ tasyāṃ jātau janayanti /	Worth of pity, they go from existence to existence, accomplishing diverse actions;
akṛtabuddhayastu varākāḥ svaṃ svaṃ vipākaphalaṃ cānubhavanta īśvaramaparaṃ mithyā parikalpayanti /	they experience the results of these actions and falsely believe that God is the cause of these results. (We trust explain the Truth in order to put an end to this false conception.
gatametadyattu khalu taduktaṃ “dvābhyāmanye tu jāyanta” iti /	) We have seen that the material dharmas arise by reason of two conditions, causes as conditions and predominating influences as conditions.

dvidhā bhūtāni taddhetuḥ bhūtaheturityarthaḥ / sabhāgasahabhūhetubhyāṃ	The primary elements are the cause of the derived elements in two ways. The four primary elements of earth, etc, are causes of the four primary elements in the quality of similar causes, and of mutually coexistant causes.
bhautikasya tu pañcadhā /	And of the derived elements, in five ways.
bhautikasya tu bhūtāni pañcaprakāro hetuḥ / katham / “jananānniḥśrayāt sthānādupastambhogavṛṃhaṇāt“	The four primary elements are causes of the derived elements—color, taste, etc—in five ways, in the quality of janana, niśraya.
so 'yaṃ kāraṇahetureva punaḥ paṇycadhā bhinnaḥ / jananahetustebhya utpatteḥ /	Jananahety ot generating cause, because the derived elements arise from them, like a child from his parents.

pratiṣṭhāheturādhārabhāvāt / citrakṛtyavat /	Pratiṣṭhāhetu or supporting cause, because the derived elements aṟe supported by them, as a picture is supported by a wall.

teṣvavītarāgasya yo rāgaḥ sa kāmarāgaḥ / yatrānuśete so 'pi dharmaḥ kāmapratisaṃyuktaḥ /	“Craving proper to Kāmadhātu” is the craving of the being who is not detached from this place, who has not rejected craving with regard to the āharmas of this place.

asamāhitabhūmiko vā rāgaḥ kāmarāgaḥ /	Or rather, “craving proper to Kāmadhātu” is the craving of a being who is not absorbed;
dhyānārūpyeṣu rāgo rūpārūpyarāgaḥ /	“craving proper to Rūpadhātu, to Ārūpyadhātu” is craving relative to the absorption of dhyāna, to the absorptions of ārāpya. The mind by which one creates magical objects in the sphere of Kāmadhātu is the result of a dhyāna. But this mind is produced only among beings detached from Kāmadhātu.
nirmāṇacitte kathaṃ kāmarāgaḥ / śrutvā parihāya ca tadāsvādanāt /	How can one say that this mind is of the sphere of Kāmadhātu?
nirmāṇavaśena vā nirmāyaka citto 'pi rāgaḥ / gandharasanirmāṇādvā /	In fact, this mind is not produced among a being not detached from Kāmadhātu, and, when this mind is produced among a being detached. This mind is hence of the sphere of Kāmadhātu without there being, with regard to it, any craving of the order of Kāmadhātu: this is a difficulty that contradicts your definition of the Dhātus.
tasya kāmavacaratvam /	‘This mind is of the sphere of Kāmadhātu because a craving of the order of Kāmadhātu is produced with regard to it in a person who intends to speak of this mind as belonging to another, or who remembers having possessed it previously, or who sees magic creations.
rūpāvacareṇa tayoranirmāṇāt /	Or rather because this mind creates some odors or tastes: now a mind of the sphere of Rūpadhātu cannot create odo1s or tastes because beings in Rūpadhātu are detached from both of these.
kiṃ punarekameva traidhātukam /	Is this triple Dhātu unique?
traidhātukānāmanto nāsti / yāvadākāśaṃ tāvanto dhātavaḥ / atha eva ca nāstyapūrvasattvaprādurbhāvaḥ /	The triple Dhātus are infinite, like space;

yathā pūrvasyāṃ diśi evaṃ dakṣiṇāsyāṃ paścimāyāmuttarasyāmi“ti / natūktamūrdhvamadhaśceti / ūrdhvamapyadhho 'pītyapare /	as towards the East, the same towards the South, the West and the North.” The Sūtra does not add “toward the zenith and the nadir.”
nikāyāntarapāṭhād /	According to another opinion, the universe superimposes itself toward the zenith and the nadir, for, according to other Sūtras, the universes are arranged towards the ten cardinal points.
akaniṣṭhādūrdhvaṃ punaḥ kāmadhātuḥ / kāmadhātoścādhaḥ punarakaniṣṭhāḥ /	There is then a Kāmadhātu above Akaniṣṭha and an Akaniṣṭha below Kāmadhātu.
yaścaikasmāt kāmadhātorvītarāgaḥ sa sarvebhyaḥ /	Whoever is detached from one Kāmadhātu is detached from the Kāmadhātus of all the universes;

narakādisvanāmoktā gatayaḥ pañca teṣu	In these Dhātus, there are five realms of rebirth that have been designated by their names.
narakāstiryañcaḥ pretā devā manuṣyā iti / svaireva nāmabhisteṣu pañca gatayaḥ proktāḥ /	The five gatis or realms of rebirth are hellish beings, animals, Pretas, humans, and gods.

kiṃ punargatinirmuktāḥ santi dhātavo yata dhātuṣvityucyante /	Is there then a part of the Dhātus that are not included in the realms of rebirth? Yes.
santi kuśalakliṣṭabhājanāntarābhavasvabhāvā api dhātavaḥ /	The good, the bad, the physical world, and intermediate existence are included in the Dhātus.
yāstu pañca gatayaḥ / tāḥ /	Whereas, as for the five destinies.
akliṣṭāvyākṛtā eva sattvākhyā nāntarābhavaḥ //	They are undefiled-neutral, they are the world of beings, and they do not include intermediate existence.
anivṛtāvyākṛtā eva gatayaḥ /	The realms of rebirth are undefiled-neutral, being the result of retribution.
anyathā hi gatisaṃbhedaḥ syāt /	In the contrary hypothesis, the five realms of rebirth would be confounded. [in fact, a person can do actions which are]repaid through a hellish rebirth, or by a heavenly rebirth: but if action were to be integral to the realms of rebirth, the human realm of rebirth would be at one and the same time hellish and heavenly. A being born in Kāmadhātu is filled with the defilements of this sphere and can be filled with the defilements of higher spheres.
sattvākhyā eva ca nacāntarābhavasvabhāvāḥ /	They are sat$vākhya, only pertaining to living beings: the physical world is not included within the realms of rebirth. Intermediate existence is not a realm of rebirth. The nature of the realms of rebirth is illustrated by many texts: 1.
prajñyaptipūktam “catasṛbhiryonibhiḥ pañca gatayaḥ saṃgṛhītā natu pañcabhirgatibhiścatasro yonayaḥ /	The Prajñāpti says, "The four wombs exist in the five realms of rebirth;
kimasaṃbṛhītam /	but do the five realms of rebirth contain all four wombs?

sūtre 'pi ca bahiṣkṛto 'ntarābhavo gatibhyaḥ / kasmin sūtre / “sapta bhavā narakabhavastiryagbhavaḥ pretabhavo devabhavo manuṣyabhavaḥ karmabhavo 'ntarābhava” iti /	The Sūtra itself says that intermediate existence is not included among the realms of rebirth: “There are seven bhavas or existences: existence in hell, animal, Preta, heavenly, humanṉ, plus ézrmabhava and intermediate existence.”
atra hi pañca gatayaḥ sahetukāḥ sahāgamanāścoktāḥ / atha eva cānivṛtāvyākṛtāḥ sidhyanti / taddhetoḥ karmabhavasya tābhyo bahiṣkaraṇāt / kāśmīrāśca sūtraṃ paṭhanti /	This Sūtra indicates the five realms of rebirth with their cause, namely action or karmabhava, and their access, namely intermediate existence through which a being arrives at a reams of rebirth.
sthaviraśāriputreṇoktaṃ “nārakāṇāmāyuṣmannāsravāṇāṃ saṃmukhībhāvānnarakavedanīyāni karmāṇi karotyupacinoti /	At the same time, this Sūtra shows that the realms of rebirth are undefiled neutral, since it distinguishes the realms of rebirth (hellish, etc. , existences), from the causes of these realms of rebirth, namely action which is non-neutral. This last point is again proved by a Sūtra which the Kāśmīrians read: “Śāriputra said, ‘Venerable One, when the hellish cankers become active, one does and one accumulates actions which. should be renumerated by hell.
teṣāmāyuṣman kāyavāṅmanovaṅkānāṃ kāyavāṅmanodoṣakaṣāyāṇā narakeṣu rūpaṃ saṃjñā vedanā saṃskāro vijñānaṃ vipāko vipacyate /	These action of the body, voice, and mind, torturous, corrupted, ‘tainted’ action have for retribution rupa, vedana, samjna, samskaras and vijnana in hell.
nirvṛtte vipāke nāraka iti saṃkhyāṃ gacchati /	When this retribution is realized, there is what is called hell.
tatrāyuṣmannārako nopalabhyate 'nyatra tebhyo dharmebhya” iti /	Venerable One, outside of these five dharmas, one cannot maintain the existence of any being in hell.
ato 'pyanivṛtāvyākṛtā eva gatayaḥ /	But how can this thesis accord with the declaration of the Prakaranagramtha (according to Saeki, this is a summary of TD 26, p.
prakaraṇāgranthastarhi parihāryo “gatiṣu sarve 'nuśayā anuśerata” iti /	702a8-711b5): “'All the latent defilements reside in and develop in realms of rebirth?”
pratisaṃdhicittāni hi gatīnāṃ pañcaprakārāṇi santyataḥ sapraveśagatigrahaṇādadoṣa eva /	The answer is that this declaration refers to the initial mind (samdhicittay of the realms of rebirth, which can be of five types, abandoned through Seeing the Four Noble Truths or through Meditation: hence all the latent defilements can reside there.
grāmagrahaṇe grāmopacāra grahaṇavat /	As one says 'village’ for ‘the confines of the village, the Prakaran can express itself.
kuśalakliṣṭā apītyapare /	According to another opinion, the realms of rebirth are both good and defiled.
yaktūktam “karmabhavasya tābhyo bahiṣkaraṇā“diti / nāvaśyaṃ pṛthagvacanādbahiṣkṛto bhavati /	In fact, say the followers of this opinion, the argument quoted from the Śākra of the Seven Existences does not hold: it is maintained that action is separate from the five realms of rebirth, but this does not prove that it is excluded from them.
tadyathā pañcasu kaṣāyeṣu kleśadṛṣṭikaṣāyau pṛthaguktau / na ca dṛṣṭayo na kleśāḥ /	Among the five corruptions the corruption of defilements and the corruption of views are quoted separately: shall one say that views are not a defilement?
evaṃ karmabhavo 'pi gatiśca syāt /	Action is also included within the realms of rebirth.
pṛthak cāsya vacanaṃ syāt gatihetujñāpanāṛtham /	It is quoted separately because it is the cause of the realms of rebirth.
antarābhave 'pyeṣa prasaṅgaḥ / nāyogāt /	Does your reasoning apply to the intermediate existence which would then be a realm of rebirth?
gacchanti tāmiti gatiḥ /	The word gati or realm of rebirth signifies “the place where one goes.
nacāntarābhavo gantavyaścyutideśa evotpādanāt /	” Now the intermediate existence begins in the place where death has taken place.
ārūpyā api gatirna bhaviṣyanti / cyutideśa evotpādāt /	This is also the case for the existences of Ārūpyadhātu which then are not included among the realms of rebirth.
evaṃ tarhyantarābhavatvādevāntarābhavo na gatirgatyantarālatvāt /	We say then that intermediate existence is so called because it is intermediate between two realms of rebirth, but it is itself not a realm of rebirth.
yadi hi gatiḥ syādantarābhava ityeva na syāt /	If it were a realm of rebirth it would not be intermediate, and so it would not be called an intermediate existence. Admitting that you have refuted the argument taken from the Śūéra of the Seven Existences, what do you make of the declaration of Śāriputra?
yatarhi sthaviraśāriputreṇoktaṃ “nirvṛtte vipāke nāraka iti saṃkhyāṃ gacchatī“ti /	Śāriputra says that there is a being in hell when the retribution of hellish actions is realized;
nirvṛtte vīpāka ityuktaḥ natu vipāka eveti /	it does not say that the realm of rebirth is part retribution, part non-retribution.
yattarhyaktaṃ “tatrāyuṣmannārako nopalabhyate 'nyatra tebhyo dharmebhya” iti / gatigāminaḥ pudgaladravyasya pratiṣedhaṃ karoti nānyatra skandhebhya upalabhyate nāraka iti na tu skandhāntarapratiṣedham /	The text says that there does not exist any being in hell outside of these dharmas, rāpa, etc. its intention is to negate the reality of any person passing from one realm of rebirth into another, not to affirm that the s&andhas of the beings in hell are solely retribution.
avyākṛtā eva tu gatayo varṇyante vaibhāṣikaiḥ /	For the Vaibhāṣīkas, the realms of rebirth are exclusively undefiledneutral dharmas.
tāśca vipākasvabhāvā evetyeke / aupacayikasvabhāvā apītyapare /	Among the Vaibhāṣikas, some think that they are.
atraiva pañcagatike dhātutraye yathākramaṃ veditavyāḥ	In the three Dhātus with their five realms of rebirth, there is, in ascending order, Seven abodes or types of consciousnesses, namely: beings different in bodies and ideas;
nānātvakāyasaṃjñāśca nānākāyaikasaṃjñinaḥ /	beings of different bodies but similar in ideas;
viparyayāccaikakāyasaṃjñāścārūpiṇasrayaḥ //	beings similar in body but different in ideas;

rūpiṇaḥ santi nānātvakāyā ekatvasaṃjñinastadyathā devā brahmakāyikā ye tatprathamābhinirvṛttāḥ / iyaṃ dvitīyā vijñānasthitiḥ /	Material beings different in bodies but of similar ideas, namely.

anyathaiva tu mahābrahmaṇa ārohapariṇāha ākṛtivigraho vāgbhāṣā cīvaradhāraṇaṃ ca anyathā tatparṣada iti nānātvakāyāḥ /	” There is diversity of body, for one is Brahmā, and the others his followers through their height, their greatness, their bodies, their speech, their clothing and their ornaments.
yadidamuktaṃ sūtre “teṣāmevaṃ bhavati imaṃ vayaṃ sattvamadrākṣma dīrghāyuṣaṃ dīrghamadhvānaṃ tiṣṭhantaṃ yāvadaho vatānye 'pi sattvā ihopapadyeranmama sabhāmatāyāmi“ti / asya ca sattvasyaivañcetasaḥ praṇidhirvayaṃ cehopapannā iti /	We read in the Sātra that these gods remember, “We have seen this being of great sight, who lasts so long,” and so on to “when he made the vow, ‘May other beings be born here in my company! ,' we were born in his company.
kathaṃ tamadrākṣuḥ / ābhāsvarasthā ityeke /	” We ask then where were these gods when they saw Brahmā?

Having seen him, they think: “We have seen this being. and they know the vow that he made through memory of the sphere of the First Dhyāna which they obtained through the very fact of their birth; or rather because Brahmā told them.

atra punaḥ paryantagrahaṇātsakaladvitīyadhyānagrahaṇaṃ veditavyam /	The Sūtra, in naming the highest gods of the Second Dhyāna, the Ābhāṣsvaras, also designates the Parīttābha and the Apramāṇābha gods.
anyathā hi parīttābhā apramāṇābhāśca kasyāṃ vijñānasthitau vyavasthāpyeran /	If it were otherwise, to which v#ñānasthūi would these two classes belong?
tatrābhinnavarṇaliṅgasaṃsthānatvādekatvakāyāḥ /	There is no difference of color, mark, or figure among them: thus these gods have similar bodies.

te kila maulyāṃ bhūmau saumanasyendriyaparikhinnāḥ sāmantakādupekṣendriyaṃ saṃmukhībhavanti /	In fact, it is said,—wrongly according to us,—that these gods, fatigued with the sensation of mental pleasure—which is the sensation proper to the Second Dhyāna—pass into the threshold absorption of this Dhyāna, an absorption which allows the sensation of neither-pleasure-nor-displeasure.
sāmantake copekṣendriyaparikhinnāḥ punamaulyā bhumeḥ saumanasyendriyaṃ saṃmukhīkurvanti /	Fatigued from this second sensation, they again take up the Second Dhyāna and the sensation of mental pleasure.
yathā kāmaratiparikhinnā īśvarā dharmaratiṃ pratyanubhavanti dharmaratiparikhinnāḥ kāmaratimiti /	In this same way kings fatigued with the pleasures of lust take up the pleasure of government, and fatigued with dharma take up again the pleasure of lust. One would object that it should hold for a god of the Third Dhyāna as for the gods of the Second Dhyāna: yet the gods of the Third Dhyāna do not pass into sāmantaka, and always possess the sensation of pleasure.
nanu ca śubhakṛtsneṣvapyeṣa prasṅgaḥ /	But this objection is in vain.
na teṣāṃ tena sukhenāsti parikhedaḥ / kiṃ kāraṇam /	The Śubhakṛtsnas do not become fatigued with the pleasures of the Ābhāsvaras, since they are calm, whereas the pleasures of the Ābhāsvaras, being mental pleasures, trouble the mind and are not calm.

sūtra uktaṃ “yathā te nānātvasaṃjñinaḥ /	They quote the Sūtra (Śaptasñryavyākaraṇa, Dīrgha TD, p. and Madhyama, TD, p. ): “Beings that are born for a short time in Ābhāsvara Heaven know poorly the laws of the destruction of the universe.

The explanation of the Vaibhāsikas then, that these gods exchange the sensation of pleasure and indifference, is not good.
ekatvasaṃjñinaḥ sukhasaṃjñitvāt /	They have the same ideas, because they have the sensation of pleasure.
tatra prathame dhyāne kliṣṭayā saṃjñayā ekatvasaṃjñinaḥ /	In the First Dhyāna, there is uniformity of ideas, ideas defiled since. they are associated with fṝavrataparāmarfa; in the Second Dhyāṇna, there is dīvetsity of ideas, namely good ideas of the Dhyāna proper and of its threshold absorption;
dvitīye kuśalayā saṃjñayā nānātvasaṃjñinastṛtīye vipākajayā saṃjñayāekatvasaṃjñinaḥ /	and in the third Dhyāṇna, there is uniformity of ideas, ideas arisen from retribution.

bhavāgre nirodhasamāpattiścittasantaticchedāt /	the ascetic can cultivate nirodhasamāpatti, the absorption of the cessation of ideas and sensations.
punarāha / yatrehasthānāṃ gantukāmatā tatrasthānāṃ cāvyuccalitukāmatā 'sau vijñānasthitiruktā /	According to another explanation, véjñānasthiti is “the place where those who are here desire to go, the place from whence those who are there do not desire to fall.
apāyeṣu cobhayaṃ nāshi /	” These two conditions are absent in the painful realms of rebirth.
caturthe dhyāne sattvā uccalitamānasāḥ pṛthagjanā āsaṃjñikaṃ praveṣṭukāmā āryāḥ śuddhāvāsān bhavāgrānapaṭupracāratvānna vijñānasthitiriti /	As for the Fourth Dhyāṇa, all those who are in it desire to leave it: Pṛthagjanas desire to pass to the realm of the Asaṁjñisattvas; Āryans desire to pass to the Śuddhāvāsikas; and the Śuddhāvāsikas desire to realize the calm of extinction, fāntanirodha. Bhavāgra is not a viṝñānasthiti because there is little activity of the viñāna in it.
etāśca sapta vijñānasthitayo yathoktāḥ / bhavāgrāsaṃjñisattvāśca sattvāvāsā nava smṛtāḥ //	The seven vijñānasthitis, with Bhavāgra and unconscious beings, are the nine “dwellings of beings.
eṣu hi sattvā āvasanti svecchayā / anicchāvasanānnānye	” For creatures dwell therein as they will. There are no other dwellings of beings, for elsewhere one lives without desiring it. “Elsewhere” refers to the painful realms of rebirth.

atastena sattvāvāsā bandhanasthānavat /	This is not one of the “dwellings” in the same way that a prison is not a dwelling.
anyatra sūtre sapta vijñānasthitaya uktāḥ anyatra	If one Sūtra says that there are seven vijñāṉasthii, according to another Sūtra.
catasraḥ sthitayaḥ punaḥ /	There are four other sthitis.
katamāścatasraḥ / rūpopagā vijñāna sthitirvedanopagā saṃjñopagā saṃskāropagā iti / tāsāṃ kaḥ svabhāvaḥ / tā hi yathākramaṃ /	These four are: rūpa as an abode of vijñāna, vedanā or sensation as an abode of vijñāna, ideas as an abode of vijñāna, and the saṁskāras or forces as an abode of vijñáāna.
catvāraḥ sāsravāḥ skandhāḥ te punaḥ svabhūmāveva nānyatra bhūmau / kiṃ kāraṇam / pratiṣṭā hi sthitiḥ /	They consist of the four impure skandhas, which are of the same sphere as the vzjñāna.
na ca visabhāgabhūmikeṣu skanheṣu vijñānaṃ tṛṣṇāvaśāt pratitiṣṭhatīti /	The consciousness or vijāna can grasp visible things and the other skaṇdhas of a different sphere as its object: but it cannot grasp them as object under the impulse of craving; thus they are not considered as its abode or sthiti.
kasmānna vijñānaṃ vijñānasthitirucyate yathā saptasu vijñānasthitiṣu pañca skandhā iti /	But why is the fifth séandha, the consciousness itself (mind and mental states), not considered as an abode of the consciousness?
sthātuḥ parihāreṇa sthitividhānāt / nahi sthātaiva sthitirucyate /	‘The Vaibhāṣikas observe that the sthii, “that upon which,or withinDevadatta is opposed to the horse that he is sitting on.
yathā na rājaiva rājāsanamiti /	The king is not the throne.

yattarhi sūtra uktaṃ “vijñāne āhāre asti nandī asti rāga iti /	But another Śūtra says, “There is delight and attachment with regard to this food which is the consciousness”.
yatrāsti nandī asti rāgaḥ pratiṣṭhitaṃ tatra vijñānamadhirūḍhami“ti / tatkatham /	If there is delight and attachment with regard to the consciousness then the consciousness rides in it and resides in it.
“sapta ca vijñānasthitayaḥ pañcaskandhasaṃgṛhītā” iti tatkatham /	On the other hand, you teach that the five séandhas constitute the sevenfold abode of consciousness; why do you not add the consciousness to the fourfold abodes of consciousness? The Vaibhāṣikas answer: When we consider, without making any distinction between the séandhaus, the process attached to the consciousness with regard to its arising which is made up of the five.
evaṃ tarhyabhedenopapattyāyatanasaṃgṛhīteṣu skandheṣu sābhirāmāyāṃ vijñānapravṛttau vijñānaṃ vijñānasthitiḥ / pratyekaṃ tu yathā rūpādayo vijñānasya saṃkleśāya bhavanti /	But, if we consider the skandhas one by one, we see that matter, sensation, ideas, and the samskaras—which are the support of the consciousness, and are associated or coexistent with the consciousness—are the causes of the defilement of the consciousness: but the consciousness is not, in this way, the cause of the defilement of the consciousness, since two consciousnesses do not coexist.
tasmāccatasṛṣu vijñānasthitiṣu	Thus 7d-8a.
kevalam // vijñānaṃ na sthitiḥ proktaṃ	Taken separately, the consciousness is not defined as an abode of the consciousness.
api ca kṣetrabhāvena bhagavatā catasro vijñānasthitayo deśitāḥ /	Further, the Blessed One described the four abodes of consciousness as “a field,” and he describes the consciousness, accompanied by desire, as “a seed.”
vījabhāvena ca sopādānaṃ vijñānaṃ kṛtsnameveti na punarbījaṃ bījasya kṣetrabhāvena vyavasthāpayāṃbabhūvetyabhiprāyaṃ parikalapayāmāsa /	He does not give the seed as a field of the seed;

pretā api jarāyujāḥ // apiśabdādapyupapādukā iti / āyuṣmate mahāmaudgalyāyanāya pretī nivedayate	Pretas are also born from a womb. They are of two types, apparitional and born from a womb.
“pañca putrānahaṃ rātrau divā paña tathā parān / bhakṣayāmi janitvā tān nāsti tṛptistathāpi me //“	That they are born from a womb results from a discourse that a Pretī had with Maudgalyāyana, “I gave birth to five sons a night, to five sons a day:Iate them and was not satisfied.
katamā yoniḥ sarvasādhvī /	” What is the best womb?
upapādukā /	The apparitional womb. But the Bodhisattva in his last birth evidently possesses “mastery relating to arising”.

evaṃ hi kriyamāṇe mahāntamarthaṃ paśyati /	The Bodhisattva sees great advantage in it: by reason of their relationship with hirn, the great Śūākya clan enters into the Good Law;
jñātisaṃbandhena mahataḥ śākyavaṃśasya dharme 'vataraṇārthaṃ cakravarttivaṃśyo 'yamiti	and, recognizing in him a member of the family of the Cakravartins, persons experience a great respect towards him;

piśāca iti vā yathā 'nyatīrthyā apabhāṣante kalpaśatasyātyayādevaṃvidho māyāvī loke prādurbhūya māyayā lokaṃ bhakṣayatīti /	” In fact non-Buddhists masters calumniously say that at the end of one hundred cosmic periods there would appear in the world such a magician who devours the world through his magic.
apare tvāhuḥ / śarīradhātūnāmavasthāpanārthaṃ yeṣumanuṣyā anye ca prajāṃ vijñāya sahasraśaḥ svargaṃ	Others explain that the Bodhisattva has taken up the womb in order that his body remains as relics after his Nirvāṇa: through the adoration of these relics, humans and other creatures by the thousands obtain heaven and deliverance.

ādhiṣṭhānikīmṛddhiṃ bhagavata icchatāṃ na yukta ekṣa parihāraḥ /	But we see indeed that this explanation cannot be admitted by the masters who attribute rádhi ādhiṣṭhānikī to the Buddha.
praśnātpraśnāntaramupajāyate /	One question arises from another.
yadyapyupapādukānāṃ kāyanidhanaṃ na prajñayate kathamuktaṃ sūtre “upapādukaḥ suparṇī upapādukaṃ nāgamuddharati bhakṣārthami“ti /	If the bodies of apparitional beings disappear at their deaths, how can the Sūtra say, “The apparitional Garuḍa seizes the apparitional Nāga in order to eat it?
noktaṃ bhakṣayatītyapi tūddharati bhakṣārthamajñatvādityadoṣaḥ /	”The text says that he seizes the Nāga in order to eat it, not that he does eat it.
bhakṣayati vā yāvanna mṛto bhavati na pounrmṛtasyāsya tṛṣyatīti /	Or rather he eats the Nāga as long as the Nāga is not dead: but he does not feast on the dead Nāga.

maraṇabhavasyopapattibhavasya cāntarā ya ātmabhāvo 'bhinirvarttate deśāntaropapattisamprāptaye so 'ntarābhava ityucyate /	Intermediate existence, which inserts itself between existence at death and existence at birth, not having arrived at the location where it should go, cannot be said to be born. Between death—that is, the five rkandhas of the moment of death—and arising—that is, the five skaṉdhas of the moment of rebirth—there is found an existence—a “body” of five seandhas—that goes to the place of rebirth.
gatyantarālatvāt /	This existence between two realms of rebirth is called intermediate existence.
kathamayaṃ jātaśca nāma nacopapanno bhavati / gamyadeśānupetatvānnopapanno 'ntarābhavaḥ //	‘This existence is produced: why not say that it arises ;

padergatyarthatvāt / nacāyaṃ gamyadeśamupagatontarābhavastasmānnopapannaḥ / kaḥ punarasau deśo gantavyaḥ /	but it is not born.
yatrākṣiptasya vīpākasyābhivyaktiḥ samāptiśca /	In fact, as its etymology indicates, to be born is to arrive. Intermediate existence, when it begins, has not arrived at the place where it should go, namely to the place where the retribution of actions is manifested and achieved.
vicchinna evopapattibhavo maraṇabhavātsaṃbhavatīti nikāyāntarīyāḥ / tadetanneṣyate / kiṃ kāraṇam / yuktitaśca āgamataśca / tatra tāvat yuktiṃ niśrityocyate /	According to other sects, there is a cutting off, a discontinuity between death and birth: but there is no intermediate existence. This opinion is false, as reasoning and Scripture prove.
vrīhisantānasādharmvādavicchinnabhavodbhavaḥ /	Being similar to the series of rice, existence does not reproduce itself after having been interrupted. The momentary dharmas exist in a series;
santānavarttināṃ hi dharmāṇāmavicchedena deśāntareṣu prādurbhāvo dṛṣṭastadyathā vrīhisantānasya /	when they appear in a place distant from that in which they have been found, it is because they are reproduced without discontinuity in intermediate places, such as the series that constitutes a grain of rice and which one transports to a distant village by passing through all the villages in the interval.
tasmādasyāpi sattvasantānasyāvicchedena deśāntareṣu prādurbhāvo bhaviṣṇuḥ /	In the same way, the mental series takes up birth after being reproduced.
vicchinno 'pi dṛṣṭaḥ prādurbhāvastadyathā ādarśādiṣu bimbāt pratibimbasya /	But, one would say, a reflection arises on a mirror, on the water, etc. , without being continuous to the image with which it forms a series.
evaṃ maraṇabhavādupapattibhavasya syāt /	Hence the elements of arising do not depend on the elements forming an uninterrupted series between the place of death and the place where they reappear.
pratibimbamasiddhatvādasāmyācchānidarśanam //	The existence of the reflection is not proved; should it be proved, the reflection is not similar; hence it does not serve as an example.
pratibimbaṃ nāmānyadevotpadyate dharmāhntaramityasiddhametat /	A reflection is a thing in and of itself, namely a certain type of color.
siddhāvapi ca satyāmasāmyādanidarśanaṃ bhavati / kathaṃ tāvadasiddham /	The existence of the reflection is not proved.
sahaikatra dvayābhāvāt	For two things do not exist in the same spot.
tatraiva hi deśe ādarśarūpaṃ dṛśyate pratibimbaṃ ca /	In one and the same spot, a person placed to the side of a mirror perceives the r%pa or physical matter of this mirror, matter derived from the primary elements; a person placed facing (the mirror) perceives his own reflection, which is a “certain type of color,” derived matter. Now one can admit only that two derived matters exist.
na caikatra deśe rūpadvayasyāsti sahabhāva āśrayabhūtabhedāt /	at the same time in the same spot, for each of them should have as its support two distinct groups of primary elements.
tathā digbhedavyavasthiterekasminvāpyambudeśe svābhimukhadeśasthānāṃ rūpāṇāmanyo	Two persons who both look at the same object, a jar, etc. , see it at the same time.
'nyaṃ pratibimbakamupalabhyate natvekatra rūpe dvayoḥ paśyatoḥ sahadarśanaṃ na bhavatīti na tatra rūpāntaropapattiryuktā /	Now two persons placed at the two sides of a pond see the reflection of the object that faces them: the same reflection is not seen at the same time by both of them.
chāyātapayośca dvayoḥ sahaikatrabhāvo na dṛṣṭaḥ /	Shade and sunlight do not coexist in the same spot.
upalabhyate ca chāyāstha ādarśe sūryasya prativimbakamiti na yukto 'sya tatra prādurbhāvaḥ /	Now, if one places a mirror in the shade, in a shed situated close to a pond lit by the sun, one would see in this mirror the reflection of the reflection of the sun on the surface of the water. It is thus proved, by these three observations, that a reflection is not a real, substantial thing. The Kārikā is iable to another interpretation.
athavā “sahaikatra dvayābhāvādi“ti katamasya dvayasya / ādarśatalasyendupratibimbakasya ca /	“For the two things do not exist in the same spot”: the “two things” are the surface of the mirror and the reflection of the moon.
anyatraiva hi deśe ādarśatalaṃ bhavatyanyatraivāntargataṃ candrapratibimbakaṃ dṛśyate kūpa ivodakam /	We do not see, in the same spot, the surface of the mirror and the reflection of the moon, reflected in the. This reflection appears recessed, at a depth, like the water in a well.
tacca tatropapadyamānaṃ nānyatropalabhyate /	Now if a real physical matter, the reflection, should arise, it would arise on the surface of the mirror, and would be perceived as being on the surface of the mirror.
ato nāstyeva tat kiñcit /	A reflection is thus only an illusory idea taking the form of the reflection (pratikimbākāraṁ bhrāntaṁ vijñānam).
sāmagryāstu sa tasyāstādṛśaḥ prabhāvo yattathā darśanaṃ bhavati //	Such is the power of this complex, mirror and object, that it produces the seeing of a reflection, of an image resembling the object.
acintyo hi dharmāṇāṃ hi dharmāṇāṃ śaktibhedaḥ /	Incomprehensible is the power of the dharmas and the variety of this power. Let us admit nevertheless the real existence of the reflection.
evaṃ tāvandasiddhatvāt /	It still cannot serve as an example in your reasoning, for it cannot be compared to arising.
kathamasāmyādanidarśanaṃ bhavati /	It is not similar to arising.
asantānād	For it does not form a series.
nahi vimvasya pratibimbakaṃ santānabhūtamādarśasantānasaṃvaddhatvāt sahabhāvācca / yathā maraṇasyopapattibhavaḥ / santānaṃ ca pratyavicchedena deśāntareṣu prādurbhāva udāhṛato nāsantānamityasāmyaṃ dṛṣṭāntasya pratibimbasya ca /	The reflection does not form a series with the object reflected, because the reflection arises supported by the mirror, and because the reflection is simultaneous to the object reflected.
dvayodayāt /	But on the contrary. For it arises from two causes.
dvābhyāṃ hi kāraṇābhyāṃ pratibimbasyodayo bhavati /	It is by reason of two causes that a reflection arises, by reason of the mirror and of the object.
bimbāccādarśā cceti yat prādhānaṃ kāraṇaṃ tadāśrityotpadyate /	The principal of these two causes is the cause upon which it takes its support in order to arise, namely the mirror. But it happens that arising, or birth, proceeds from only one cause;
nacaivamupapattibhavasyāpi dvābhyāṃ kāraṇābhyāṃ saṃbhavo maraṇabhavāccānyataśca pradhānabhūtādityato 'pyayamasamāno dṛṣṭāntaḥ /	and it never has a principal cause which is not death. Arising has no external support in the case of apparitional beings, because they appear suddenly in space.
na ca yuktamuktaṃ bāhyameva cetanaṃ śukraśoṇitaṃ pradhānakāraṇamiti / yatra cāndhakāṇa eva prādurbhāva upapādukānāṃ tatra kiṃ parikalpyate /	And these external elements cannot be the principal cause for the beings that arise from semen, blood, or mud, since these items are absent from the mind.
evaṃ tāvadyuktito neṣyate / na marāṇabhavādvicchinna upapattibhavaprādurbhāvaḥ /	Reasoning thus proves the existence of an intermediate being since arising proceeds from death without there being any discontinuity between these two existences. Scripture also proves the existence of an intermediate being.
tasmādastyevāntarābhavaḥ /	The intermediate being is called by its name.
kaṇṭhokteścāsti sūtra uktaṃ “sapta bhavāḥ / narakabhavastiryagbhavaḥ pretabhavo devabhavo manuṣyabhavaḥ karmabhavo 'ntarābhava iti /	The Sūtra says, “There are seven existences : existence in hell, as an animal, as a Preta, as a heavenly being, and as a human, as well as karmabhava and antarābhava.”

Thus they do not correspond to the examples of the Sūtra.
ārupyeṣvapi cāntarāparinirvāyī paṭhyetāyuḥpramāṇāntare parinirvāṇāt / na ca paṭhyate /	On the other hand, there are saints in Ārūpyadhātu who obtain Nirvāṇa without having fully lived their lives to the end, and yet no antarāparinirvāyins are there.
“dhyānaiścatasro daśikā ārupyaiḥ saptikātrayam /	This point is illustrated in the metrical formula, By the dhyānas, four decades; by the ārāpyas, three heptades;

yeṣāṃ tu tāvadayamāgamaḥ pramāṇaṃ teṣāmāgamato 'pi siddho 'ntarābhavaḥ /	We say that, for the masters who admit these Sūtras, the existence of an intermediate being or the “shanāáhas in theinterval is proved both by Scripture and reasoning. Yet there are some difficulties: a. We must reconcile the doctrine of an intermediate being with the Sūtra on Māra.
yattarhi sūtra uttam “atha ca punardūṣī māraḥ svaśarīreṇāvicau mahānarake prapatita” iti / tat kathamiti / sa hi jīvanneva nārakībhirjvālābhirāliṅgitaḥ / kālalṃ kṛtvā 'ntarābhavenāvīciṃ prāpta ityayaṃ tatrābhiprayaḥ /	This Sūtra says, “The Māra called Dūṣin, fell, with his own body, into great Avīci Hell.

ato 'sya dṛṣṭadharmavedanīyaṃ karma pūrvaṃ vīpakvaṃ paścādupapadyavedanīyamiti /	Māra then felt a retribution in this life before feeling a retribution in hell The text thus means that Māra was enveloped, while still alive, by the fires of hell, that he dies;
idamidānīṃ kathaṃ nīyate “pañcānantaryāṇi karmāṇi yāni kṛtvopacitya samanantaraṃ narakeṣūpapadyata” iti /	and that he then takes up an intermediate existence which leads to hell where birth in hell takes place. According to the Sūtra, there are five ānaniarya transgressions:he who commits them is immediately born in hell.
anyāṃ gatimagatvetyabhiprāyaḥ / upapadyavedanīyatvaṃ tatra karmaṇo dyotitam / atha yathārutaṃ kalpyate /	We hold that the expression "immediately” signifies “without intermediary,” without passing through another realm of rebirth which is an action “retributable in the next.
pañcaiva kṛtvā naikamiti prāpnoti / kriyānantaraṃ ca / na kālāntaraṃ jīvitvā ko vā 'ntarābhavasyopapadyamānatvaṃ necchati /	If you take the Sūtra literally, you come to absurd conclusions: you would have to say that one must have committed the five crimes in order to be reborn in hell and you would have to say that the transgressor is reborn in hell immediately after the transgression, or that he is reborn there without dying here.
antarā bhavenaiva hyasau maraṇāntaraṃ narakeṣūpapadyate /	Moreover, according to our doctrine, rebirth in hell is immediate; it is not preceded by a “birth” as an intermediate being.
abhimukhatvāt /	We maintain that, by its nature, the intermediate being is “arising’ because he is turned towards the birth that follows death;
na ca brūma upapanno bhavatīti / iyaṃ tarhi gāthā kathaṃ nīyate	we do not say that he is born. You should explain the stanza, “Your life is approaching its end, Oh Brahmin;

vāso 'pi hi nāsti te 'ntarā pātheyaṃ ca na vidyate tave” ti //	there is not for you any intervening dwelling and you have no provision.” You think that this stanza shows that there is no intermediate existence.

The texts are thus not conclusive for or against intermediate beings.

Objection: In the womb of a dog, a sow, etc. , there can die in its embryonic stage a being who should then be reborn in any one of the five realms of rebirth.
evaṃ tarhi śunīprabṛtīnāmekasmin kukṣau pāñcagatiko 'ntarābhavo 'bhinirvarttate iti nārako 'ntarābhavaḥ kukṣiṃ nirdahet /	Let us suppose then that this embryo is replaced by an intermediate being destined to go to hell.

There he sees his father and mother united. His mind is troubled by the effects of sex and hostility. When the intermediate being is male, it is gripped by a male desire with regard to the mother; when it is female, it is gripped by a female desire with regard to the father;
tatrāsya mātāpitrostāṃ vipratipattiṃ dṛṣṭvā puṃsaḥ sataḥ pauṃsno rāga utpadyate mātari stryā satyā straiṇo rāgāḥ udpadyate pitari / viparyayāt pratighaḥ /	and, inversely, it hates either the father, or the mother, whom it regards as either a male or a female rival.

It is only after reincarnation that a developing embryo can lose its sex.

According to one opinion, the primary elements of the blood and semen. According to another opinion, their support are some primary elements different from these, arisen from actions, and which repose in the semen and blood. First opinion: Semen and blood do not have any organs.

aśucisaṃniśrayotpattyabhisaṃbandhivacanāttu kalalasya sūtrāvirodha iti /	] One would object that the phrase in the Sūtra, mātāpiraśucikalalasaṁbh is not explained in this hypothesis. According to the Sūtra, the body comes from the ēa⁷a/a which is semen and blood. But the word kalala is placed there to designate.

“evamasya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya samudayo bhavatī“ti vacanāt /	That the Blessed One wanted to illustrate this manner of existence of the parts results from the conclusion of the Śūtra, “Thus there takes place the production of this great mass which is nothing but suffering.”
anyathā hi kimasya sāmarthyaṃ syāt /	But there is another explanation:
ayoniśomanaskārahetukā 'vidyoktā sūtrāntare / avidyāhetukaścāyoniśomanaskāraḥ / sa cehāpyupādānāntarbhūtatvādukto bhavatīti apare /	It is said, in another Sūtra, that ignorance has incorrect judgment for its cause, and, in still another Śūtra, that incorrect judgment has ignorance for its cause. Consequently ignorance is not without a cause and one avoids the objection of infinite regression. But incorrect judgment is not named in the Sūtra in question, the Pratīṭyasamutpādasūtra. Without doubt; but it is included in attachment: thus one does not have to separately name it here. This explanation is without value.
kathamayoniśomanaskārasyopādāne 'ntarbhāvaḥ /	How is incorrect judgment included in attachment?
yadi saṃprayogataḥ / tṛṣṇā 'vidyayorapi tasyāntarbhāvaprasaṅgaḥ /	Indeed, it is associated with attachment, but it can as equally well be associated with ignorance or with desire.

yadi tarhyantarbhāvenaiva hetuphalabhāvo vijñāyate tṛṣṇā 'vidyayorapi tarhi tatrāntarbhāvā daṅgantaratvaṃ śakyamakarttum /	One could just as well omit ignorance and desire.
anyaḥ punarāha /	Another master speaks next.
ayoniśo manaskāro heturavidyāyā uktaḥ sūtrāntare /	A Śūtra teaches that ignorance has incorrect judgment for its cause.
sa cāpi sparśakāle nirdiṣṭaḥ / “cakṣuḥ pratītya rūpāṇi cotpadyate āvilo manaskāro mohaja” iti /	A Sūtra teaches that incorrect judgment has ignorance for its cause and observes that it is produced at the moment of contact, "By reason of the eye and a visible thing there is produced a defiled judgment which arises from error.
vedanākāle cāvaśyamavidyayā bhavitavyam / “avidyāsaṃsparśajaṃ veditaṃ pratītyotpannā tṛṣṇe“ti sūtrāntarāt /	" A Sūtra explains the origin of desire, "Desire arises by reason of a sensation which itself arose from a contact wherein there is ignorance.

Hence ignorance is not without a cause;
nacāpyanavasthāprasaṅgaḥ /	there is no reason to add.
tasyāpyayoniśomanaskārasya punarmohajavacanādāvilo manaskāro mohaja iti /	A new term: incorrect judgment, the cause of ignorance, arises itself from an ignorance designated as aberration. Well and good, says the author;
tattarhyetadantyatroktamiha punarvaktavyam / na vaktavyam /	but this is not explained in the Pratīṭyasamutpādasṁtra and it should be explained there.
kathamanucyamānaṃ gamyate /	There is no reason to explain it in clearer terms, for one reaches these conclusions through reasoning.
yuktitaḥ / kayā yuktyā / nahi niravadyā vedanā tṛṣṇāyāḥ pratyayībhavatyarhatāṃ na cāvīparītaḥ sparśaḥ kliṣṭāyā vedanāyāḥ /	In fact, to the Arhats, sensation is not a cause of desire: from whence we conclude that sensation is a cause of desire only when it is defiled, associated with ignorance.
naca punarniravadyasyārhataḥ sparśo viparīta ityanayā yuktyā / atiprasaṅga evaṃ prāpnoti /	Contact, when it is not accompanied by error, is not a cause of this defiled sensation; contact accompanied by error is not produced in an Arhat, who is free from ignorance; thus the contact that pratāyasamutpāda indicates as the cause of sensation, a cause of desire, is the contact that is accompanied by ignorance. We then have sāvidjasparśapratyayā vedanā / sāvidyavedanāpratyayā trṣṇā. Sensation conditioned by contact associated with ignorance, desire conditioned by sensation associated with.
yauvat yuktyā saṃbhavati tāvadanuktam gamyata iti / tasmānna bhavatyayaṃ parihāraḥ /	But, says the author, the idea that reasoning, supported on occasion by Sutras, permits omitting indispensable terms in the incorrect judgment in question, with the reciprocal causality of incorrect judgment and ignorance, leads to absurdity.
acodyameva tvetad /	One could just as well omit contact, sensation, the samhskāras oṟ birth.
avidyājarāmaraṇayoḥ pareṇāṅgantarānabhidhānātsaṃsārasyādyantavattvaprasaṅgaḥ / nacāparipūrṇo nirdeśa iti / kiṃ kāraṇam /	The true answer to this objection that, since there is no indication of any other parts before ignorance and beyond old age and death, saṁsāra is without beginning or end, is the following: the enumeration of the parts of dependent origination is complete.

uktaṃ bhagavatā “pratītyasamutpādaṃ vo bhikṣavo deśayiṣyāmi pratītyasamutpannāṃśca dharmānityathaka eṣāṃ viśeṣaḥ / śāstratastāvanna kaścit /	”The Blessed One said, “I shall teach you, Oh Bhikṣus, pratītyasamutpāda and the dharmas produced in dependence.” What difference is there between pratīyasamutpāda and these dharmas? Noṇne, according to the Abhidharma. For, as we have seen above, both are defined as being “all the conditioned dbarmas.” A difficulty.
ubhyaṃ hi sarve saṃskṛtā dharmā iti /	“All the conditioned dharmas” means the dharmas of the three periods.
kathamidānīmanutpannā evānāgatāḥ pratītyasamutpannā ityucyante /	How can future dharmas which have not yet arisen, be termed “produced in dependence,” pratīyasamutpanna?
kathaṃ tāvadakṛtā evānāgatāḥ saṃskṛtā ucyante /	We would ask you how future dbarmras which are not yet “created” are called “conditoned”?
ābhisamskārikayā cetanayā cetitatvāt /	Because they are “thought” by the volition which is termed ābhisaṁskārṁā, that is, “executing a retribution.”
anāsravāḥ katham /	But if this is so, how will future pure dharmuas (the āharmas of the Path) be conditioned?

nirvāṇe 'pi prasaṅgaḥ / tajjātīyatvāttattatraivātideśo yathā naca tāvadrūpyate rūpaṃ cocyate tajjātīyatvādityadoṣaḥ /	But then Nirvāṇa itself will be conditioned, for one desires to acquire it.
sūtrābhiprāyastvayamucyate /	When one calls future dharmas “produced independence,” oṉe usesWhat is the intention of the Sūtra in distinguishing pratñyasamútpāda from the dharmas produced in dependence?
heturatra samutpādaḥ samutpannaṃ phalaṃ matam /	Samutpāda is the cause, whereas samutpanna is the result.
hetubhūtamaṅgapratītyasamutpādaḥ samutpadyate 'smāditi dṛtvā phalabhūtamaṅga pratītyasamutpannam / evaṃ sarvāṇyaṅgānyubhayayathā sidhyanti /	The part that is a cause is pratīyasamutpāda, 'because, there takes place arising from it.
hetuphalabhavāt / na caivaṃ satyavyavasthā bhavantyapekṣābhedāt /	The part that is a result is praīyasaṃutpanna, because it arose; but it is also prasīṣyasamutpāda, because, from it, rising takes place. All the parts, being cause and result are at one and the same time both pratītyasamutpāda and pratītyasamutpanṇa. Without this distinction, nevertheless, there would be non-determination and confusion, for a part is not prañyasamutpāda through connection to the part through connection to which it is also.
yadapakṣaya pratītyasamutpādo na tadevāpekṣya pratītyasamutpannaṃ hetuphalavat pitṛputravacca /	In the same way a father is father through connection to his son; and a son is son through connection to his father; in the same way cause and result, and the two banks of a river.
sthavirapūrṇāśaḥ kilāha syāt pratīyasamutpādo na pratītyasamutpannā dharmā iti /	But the Sthavira Pūrṇāśa says: What is pratīiyasamutpāda cannot be pratītyasamutpanna.

atra tu sautrāntikā vijñāpayanti / kiṃ khalvetā iṣṭaya ucyante yā yasyeṣṭirāhosvitsūtrārthaḥ /	The Sautrāntikas criticize: are these personal theses, fantasies, or the sense of the Sūtra?

evamatrāpi yathāpradhānaṃ nirdeśaḥ syāt /	In the same way, the Blessed Oṉe designates a state in which ignorance is the major element as ignorance.
aupasaṃhāra eṣaḥ /	This example proves nothing.

yadva “punaranyadapyasmin kāye khakūkhaṭaṃ kharagatamiti vacanāt bhavatu vā tathaivāvidyāvaśeṣo yadi śakyate darśayitum /	Perhaps the definition of the Hastipadopamasñtra is incomplete, seeing that you are able to show that there is something lacking in it.
jātyantarasya tvavidyāyāṃ kiṅkṛtaḥ prakṣepaḥ /	It remains for you to say what is lacking in the definitions that the Sūtra gives for ignorance, etc. Why define ignorance as “a state with five skandhas” by introducing heterogeneous?

utpādaśca nāmotpatturbhavatīti ko 'syāvidyādibhirabhisambandho yatasteṣāṃ pratītyasamutpāda ityucyeta /	Moreover arising is defined as “existence succeeding upon nonexistence”: what relationship can one suppose exists between an unconditioned arising and ignorance, etc. , a relationship that would permit one to say “pratityasamutpada of ignorance, etc. ? ” Finally the expression pratityasamutpada would.
padārthaścāsamartho bhavatīti nityaśa nāma pratītyasamutpādaśceti /	Since prati-i$ya-samutpāáa signifies “production by having gone to the cause”, how could a dharma be both eternal and pratīyasamutpāda at one and the same time?

“pratyeti pūrvamutpādādyadyasattvānna yujyate /	One can put this objection in verse: “Do you say that it goes towards the prazyayas before its production? This is inadmissible because it does not exist. Do you say that it goes and is produced at the same time?
saha cet ktvā na siddho 'tra pūrvakālavidhānata” iti // naiṣa doṣaḥ /	The gerundive is not justified, for the gerundive indicates priority.”
idaṃ tāvadyaṃ praṣṭavyaḥ śābdikaḥ /	The objection of the Grammarians is without value. Leṭ us ask them if that which arises is present or future.
kimavastho dharmaḥ utpadyate varttamāna utāho 'nāgate iti /	“Do you say that a present thing arises?
kiṃ cātaḥ / yadi varttamāna utpadyate /	If it has not already arisen, how can it be present?
kathaṃ varttamāno yadi notpannaḥ / utpannasya vā punarutpattāvanavasthāprasaṅgaḥ /	If it has already arisen, how could it be reborn without being reborn indefinitely?
athānāgata utpadyate kathamasataḥ kartṛtvaṃ siddhatyakartṛkā vā kriyeti /	Do you say that a future thing arises? How can you attribute to that which is future, and non-existent, the quality of agent in this action of arising? Or how can you admit an action without an agent?”
ato yadavastha utpadyate tadavastha eva pratyeti /	Consequently we would answer the Grammarians that the dharma goes towards the prakyayas in the same condition in which, according to them, the dharma arises.
kimavasthaścotpadyate / utpādābhimukho 'nāgataḥ /	In what condition, ask the Grammarians, is the barma to be found?
tadavastha eva pratyayaṃ pratyetītyucyate /	So too the dharma that goes toward the pratyayas.
aniṣpannaṃ cedaṃ yaduta śābdikīyaṃ kartṛkriyāvyavasthānaṃ bhavatītyeṣa karttā bhūtirityeṣā kriyā /	Yet the theory of the Grammarians and the manner in which they oppose an agent and action, is not tenable. For them there is an agent which is "he who arises", and an action which here is the action of arising.
na cātra bhaviturarthāt bhūtimanyāṃ kriyāṃ paśyāmaḥ / tasmādacchalaṃ vyavahāreṣu /	Now one does not maintain that the action of arising is distinct from the one who arises. There is thus nothing wrong in using, of course as conventional expressions, the words, "it arises, it is produced after having gone to the pruyayas.
eṣa tu vākyārthaḥ / asmin satyasya bhāvaḥ asyotpādādidamutpadyata iti yo 'rthaḥ so 'rthaḥ pratītyasamutpāda iti / āha cātra	The meaning of the expression pratīyasamupāda is as indicated in the Sūtra, "If that exists, then this exists; through the arising of that, there is the arising of this.
“asannutpadyate yadvat pratyetyapi tathā 'tha san /	The first phrase (If that exists .
utpanna utpadyata ityaniṣṭhā 'san purā 'pi vā //	) refers to pratya, and the second to samu⁶épāda. Thereupon one can say in verse, "If you admit that it arises at first nonexistent, nonexistent it also goes to the praéyayas.
sahakāle 'pi ca ktvā 'sti dīpaṃ prāpya tamo gatam /	If you admit that it"As for the gerundive, it also indicates concomitance: “Darkness, having attained the lamp, perishes,” or rather: “Having bathed, he lies down.”
āsyaṃ vyādāya śete ca paścāccetkiṃ na saṃvṛte //“	One does not speak in this manner of anyone who bathes, closes his mouth and lies down.
anye punarasya codyasya parihārārthamanyathā parikalpayanti /	Some other masters avoid the objection relative to the use of the gerundive by giving a very different explanation of the word pratīyasamutpāda: prati has a distributive meaning;
pratirvīpsārthaḥ /	sav signifies “coming together”;
itau sādhava ityā anavasthāyinaḥ /	ya signifies “good at leaving,” “that which does not last;
utpūrvaḥ padiḥ prādurbhāvārthaḥ /	” and the root pad preceeded by signifies “appearance,” “arising.”
tāṃ tāṃ kāraṇa sāmagrīṃ prati ityānāṃ samavāyenotpādaḥ pratītyasamutpāda iti / eṣā tu kalpanā 'traiva kalpyate /	We then have pratīyasamuṣpāda which signifies “arising together, by reason of such and such a coming together of causes, of perishable things.” This explanation holds for the expression pratā¢yasamutpāda;
iha kathaṃ bhaviṣyati “cakṣuḥ pratītya rūpāṇi cotpadyate cakṣurvijñānamiti“ti /	but it does not take into account texts suchas: a visual consciousness arises “ByWhy does the Blessed One define pratītyasamutpāda in two ways, “If that exists, then this exists;
kimarthaṃ punarbhagavān paryāyadvayamāha “asmin satīdaṃ bhavati asyotpādādidamutpadyate” iti /	” and “From the arising of that, this arises? Por many reasons: 1.
avadhāraṇārtham /	to be more specific.
yathā 'nyatrāha “avidyāyāṃ satyāṃ saṃskārā bhavanti nānyatrāvidyāyāḥ saṃskārā” iti / aṅgaparaṃparāṃ vā darśayitum /	In the first formula, it results that the saṁskāras exist when ignorance exists; but it does not result that the saskāras come into existence through the sole existence of ignorance. The second formula specifies that it is the arising of ignorance that precedes the arising of the saṁskāras;
asminnaṅge satīdaṃ bhavati asya punaraṅgasyotpādādidamutpadyata iti /	in order to indicate the succession of the parts of dependent orgination: if that exists, then they exist; from the arising of that—and not from any other thing—this arises;
janmaparaṃparāṃ vā /	in order to indicate the succession of existences: if previous existence existed, then there is present existence;
pūrvānte sati madhyānto bhavati madhyāntasyotpādādaparānta utpadyata iti /	from the arising of present existence future existence arises;
sākṣāt pāraṃparyeṇa pratyayabhāvaṃ darśayati /	in order to indicate the nature of causality which differs according to the case: the causality of the. Perits is either immediate or not immediate. For example, defiled samskaras can immediately succeed ignorance or they can be separated from it by good samskaras. But ignorance is the immediate cause of the samskaras, and a mediate cause of consciousness. According to another explanation, the Blessed One taught in this manner in order to refute the theory of non-causality, the thesis that a thing exists in the absence of a cause, and the theory of one non-arisen cause, such as Prakriti, Purusha, etc. This explanation is not good, for the second formula suffices to refute these two theories.
kadāciddhi samanantaramavidyāyāḥ saṃskārā bhavanti kadācit pāraṃparyeṇeti /	But certain non-Buddhist teachers imagine that since the ampan exists as a support, then the samskaras, consciousness, etc. , exist, being produced; that if ignorance is produced, then the samskaras are produced, and so on.
ahetunityahetuvādapratiṣedhārthamityapare /	In other words, they posit an aman which serves as a substrate to the successive causation of the dharmas.
nāsati heto bhāvo bhavati na cānutpattimato nityāt prakṛtipuruṣādikātkiñcidutpadyata iti /	The Blessed One specified, "That which arises through the arising of such a thing exists by reason of the existence of this one thing that arises, and not by reason of the existence of a certain substrate.
asyāṃ tu kalpanāyāṃ pūrvapadasya grahaṇamanarthakaṃ prāpnoti /	" The first formula would permit us to say, "If the āman exists as a support and if ignorance, etc. exists, then the saṁskāras, etc. , exist.
asyotpādādimutpadyata ityanenaivobhayavādapratiṣedhasiddheḥ /	" This second formula permits us to say, "It is true that the saṁskāras, etc. arise by reason of the arising of ignorance, etc. ; but this is on the condition that there exists a certain substrate.
santi tarhi kecidya ātmani satyāśrayabhūte saṃskārādīnāṃ bhāvaṃ parikalpayanti avidyādīnāṃ cotpādāttadutpattim / atastām kalpanāṃ paryudāsayitumidaṃ nirdhārayāṃvabhūva yasyaivotpādādyadutpadyate tasminneva sati tat bhavati nānyasmin /	" The two formulas together make these explanations untenable: "The saṁskāras have ignorance for their cause.
yadutā “vidyāpratyayāḥ saṃskārāḥ yāvadevamasya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya samudayo bhavati“ti /	Thus the production of this large and autonomous mass of suffering takes place.
aprahīṇotpattijñāpanārthamityācāryāḥ /	" The Masters think that the first formula indicates nonabandoning, non-cutting off: "If ignorance exists, not being abandoned, then the saṁskāras exist, are not abandoned;
avidyāyāmaprahīṇāyāṃ saṃskārā na prahīyante /	" whereas the second formula indicates arising: "Through the production of ignorance, the.
tasyā evotpādādutpadyanta iti vistaraḥ /	"saṁskāras are produced.
sthityutpattisaṃdarśanārthamityapare /	According to another opinion, the first formula indicates duration, and the second indicates arising;
yāvat kāraṇasrotastāvat kāryasroto bhavati /	"As long as the flux of causes asts, the fiix of results exists;
kāraṇasyaivacotpādāt kāryamutpadyata iti /	by the sole productionof a cause, its result is produced.
utpāde tvadhikṛte kaḥ prasaṅgaḥ sthitivacanasya bhinnakramaṃ ca bhagavān kimarthamācakṣita prāk sthitiṃ paścādutpoādam /	We observe that it is a question of arising; the Blessed One said in factr I shall teach you pratīyasamutpāda. Further, why would the Blessed Oṇne first teach duration and then arising?
punarāha “asmin satīdaṃ bhavatī“ti “kārye sati kāraṇasya vināśo bhavatī“ti / syānmata mahetukaṃ tarhi kāryamutpadyata ityata āha nāhetukam /	Another explanation: The formula: "If that exists, then this exists,ʼ signifies: "If the result exists, then the destruction of its cause exists.
yasmādasyotpādādidamutpadyata iti /	But let us not think that a result arises without a cause: "From the arising of that, this arises.
eṣa cetsūtrārtho 'bhaviṣyadasmin satīdaṃ na bhavatītyevācakṣata /	But, ia order to express this sense, the Blessed One shouldhave said, "If that exists, then this does not exist;
pūrvaṃ ca tāvat kāryasyotpādāne vācakṣata paścādasmin satīdaṃ na bhavatīti / evaṃ hi sādhuḥ kramo bhavati /	⁷ and he should have first indicated the arising of the result.

tasmānnaiṣa sūtrārthaḥ /	If the Śūtra should be understood as this master understands it, how does it happen that? How do the saṁskāras exist by reason of ignorance?
kathaṃ puna “rvidyāpratyayāḥ saṃskārā yāvat jātipratyayaṃ jarāmaraṇāmi“ti /	How does old age and death exist by reason of birth?
ābhisaṃbandhamātraṃ darśayiṣyāmaḥ /	Let us briefly answer this question.
bālo hi pratītyasamutpannaṃ saṃskāramātramidamityaprajānan ātmadṛṣṭyasmimānābhiniviṣṭa	The fool or Prṛthagjana does not understand that pratūyasamutpāda is merely the sanṁṣkāras, that is, conditioned dharmas—-and this produces a belief in an ātman, and egotism;
ātmanaḥ sukhārthamaduḥkhārthaṃ vā kāyādibhistrividhaṃ karmārabhate āyati sukhārthaṃ	it accomplishes the threefold action,—bodily, vocal, mental,—with a view to agreeable sensation, and to the sensation of indifference;
puṇyaṃ sukhāduḥkhāsukhārthamānaijjamaihikasukhārthamapuṇyaṃ tasyāvidyāpratyayāḥ saṃskārāḥ	non-meritorious action, with a view to agreeable sensation in this life, meritorious action, with a view to agreeable seṅsation in a future life in Kāmadhātu; and “unmoveable” action, with a view to agreeable sensation of the first three Dhyānas and the sensation of indifference of the higher stages. These actions are the serskāras that exist by reason of ignorance.
karmākṣepavaśācca vijñānasaṃatatistāṃ tāṃ gatiṃ gacchati /	Given the force of the projection of action, the series of theconsciousness goes into a realm of rebirth, renewing perpetually.
jvālāgamanayogenāntarābhavasaṃbandhāt /	This is due to the sarṁskāras.
tadanyasaṃskārāpratyayaṃ vijñānam / evaṃ ca kṛtvā tadupapannaṃ bhavati vijñānāṅganirdeśe “vijñānaṃ katamat / ṣaḍvijñānakāyā” iti /	The Pratīyasamuutpādasñra defines consciousness as the six groups of consciousnesses.
vijñānapūrvakaṃ punastasyāṃ tasyāṃ gatau nāmarūpaṃ jāyate pañcaskandhakaṃ kṛtsnajanmānugatam / vibhaṅge mahānidānaparyāye caivaṃ nirdeśāt /	With consciousness as an antecedent, nāmarpa arises in this realm of rebirth. The five tkendhas conform to the definition of the Vibhaṅga. Through the development of námarpa, the six organs arise.
“tathā nāmarūpaparipākātkrameṇa ṣaḍāyatanam /	These are the six āyatanṇas.
tato viṣayasaṃprāptau satyāṃ vijñānasaṃbhava” iti /	Encountering their object, a consciousness arises, and through the coming together of the three, consciousness, the six āyatanas, and a.
trayāṇāṃ saṃnipātaḥ sparśaḥ sukhādivedanīyaḥ /	From that, the threefold sensation, agreeable, etc. , arises.
tatastrividhā vedanā / tatstṛṣṇā /	From this threefold sensation, there arises a threefold desire;
duḥkhotpīḍitasya sukhāyāṃ vedanāyāṃ kāmatṛṣṇā / sukhāyāmaduḥkhāsukhāyāṃ ca rūpatṛṣṇā /	desire for kāmma or desire for agreeable sensation of the sphere of Kāmadhātu, in a being tormented by suffering;
aduḥkhāsukhāyāmārupyatṛṣṇā /	desire for r%pa,or desire for agreeable sensation of the three Dhyāṇas and the sensation of indifference of the Fourth; all desire for Ārūpya.
tata iṣṭavedanātṛṣṇāyāḥ kāmādīnāmutpādanam /	Then, from the desire relating to sensation, there arises a fourfold attachment: attachment to the object of sense pleasure, attachment to views, attachment to rules and rituals, and attachment to theories concerning the soul.
tatra kāmāḥ pañca kāmaguṇāḥ /	The kāmas are the five objects of pleasure.
dṛṣṭayo dvāṣaṣṭiryathā brahmajālasūtre /	The views, sixty-two in number, are as explained in the Brahmajālasra.
śīlaṃ dauḥśīlyaviratiḥ /	Śūais rejecting immorality (davhsīya, iv.
vrataṃ kukkuragovratādīni /	vrata īs the vow to act like a dog, a bull, etc. ;
yathā ca nirgranthādīnāṃ nagno ghavatyacelaka iti vistaraḥ /	for example the Nirgranthas and their nudity, the Brāhmaṇas with their staffs and.

ātmavādaḥ punarātmabhāvaḥ / ātmeti vādo 'sminnityātmavādaḥ / ātmadṛṣṭyasmimānāvityapare / kathamanayorātmavādatvam /	Ātmavāda is the person himself, and āmabhāva, īs that relating to which one says atman.
“ābhyāmātme“ti vacanāt / ātmano hyasattvādātmavādopādānamityucyate / prajñaptimātrakasyopādānāt /	According to another opinion, āmavāda is both a view of soul and thoughts pertaining to a soul, for it is by reason of these two that one says ātman, that one affirms the existence of an ātman: if Scripture uses the word vāda, "affirmation,” it is because the ātrnan does not exist.
yathokta “mātmā ātmeti bhikṣavo bālo 'śrutavān pṛthagjanaḥ prajñaptimanupatito natvatrātmā vā ātmīyaṃ vā” iti / teṣāmupādānaṃ teṣu yaśchandarāgaḥ /	It is said in fact, “The fool, the ignorant, the Pṛthagjana, conforming to the manners of vulgar speech, thinks ‘ʻme, or 'mine; ’ but there is not any “me’ or 'mine. ’” Attachment to the kārmas, views, etc. , is cbandu or desire, and rāga or craving, with regard to them.
evaṃ hi bhagavatā sarvatrākhyātam “upādānaṃ katamat /	As the Blessed One said in the Sarva, “What is attachment?
yo 'tracchandarāgaṃ” iti /	It is chandarāga.
upādānapratyayaṃ punaḥ paunarbhavikaṃ karmopacīyate /	” Because of attachment, accumulated action produces a new existence.
tadbhavaḥ /	this is bbava.
“yadapyānanda karmāyatyāṃ punarbhāvābhinivartamkamidamatra bhavasye“ti sūtrāt /	The Sūtra says, “Ānanda, action that produces a new existence is the nature of bhava.
bhavapratyayaṃ punarvijñānāvakrāntiyogena / anāgataṃ janma jātiḥ pañcaskandhikā /	” By reason of bhava, and by means of the descent of the consciousness, future arising is biṟth, which is made up of the five skandhas, being nāmarūpa in nature.
jātau satyāṃ jarāmaraṇaṃ yathā niriṣṭaṃ sūtre /	Because of birth, there is old age and death as defined in the Sūtra.
“evamasya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya samudayo ghavatī“ti / kevalasyetyātmīyarahitasya / mahato duḥkhaskandhasyetyanādyanantasya duḥkhasamūhasya /	It is in this manner that, sufficient unto itself —that is, without any relation to an ā²man—there is produced this great mass of suffering, great because it has neither beginning nor end.
samudayo bhavatīti pradurbhāvaḥ / sa eva tu vaibhāṣikanyāyo yaḥ pūrvamuktaḥ /	The theory that has just been taught—according to which the twelve parts of dependent origination are twelve states made up of the five skandhas—is a theory of the Vaibhāṣikas.
athāvidyeti ko 'rthaḥ /	What is avádyā?
yā na vidyā /	The non-vidyā, that which is not vidyā. Impossible;
cakṣurādiṣvapi prasaṅgaḥ /	for the eye is also non-vidyā.
vidyāyā abhāvastarhi /	It is an absence of vôdyā, “ignorance.
evaṃ sati na kiñcit syāt / na caitat yuktam /	” This is also impossible, for an absence is not a thing and avśdyā must be a thing, since it is a cause.
tasmāt	Thus 28c-d.
vidyāvipakṣo dharmo 'nyo 'vidyā 'mitrānṛtādivat //	Avidyā is a separate entity, the opposite of vidyā.
yathā mitraviparyayeṇa tadvipakṣabhūtaḥ kaścidamitro bhavati na tu yaḥ kaścidanyo mitrānnāpi mitrābhāvaḥ /	The non-friend is the opposite of a friend, not a non-friend, that is, anyone other than a friend, not the absence of the friend.
ṛtaṃ cocyate satyam / tadvipakṣabhūtaṃ vākyamanṛtaṃ bhavati /	Non-truth is speech contrary to true speech;
adharmānarthākāryādayaśca dharmādipratidvandvabhūtāḥ /	so too non-righteousness, non-useful and the not-to-be-done are the opposite of righteousness, useful, and duty.
evamavidyā 'pi vidyāyāḥ pratidvandvabhūtadharmāntaramiti draṣṭavyam / kuta etat /	Thus avidya—"non-knowledge"—is the opposite of vidya, a real separate dharma.
pratyayabhāvenopadeśāt /	The Sutra defines it as the cause of the sanskaras, from whence it results that it is not a mere negation.
api ca saṃyojanādivacanāt saṃyojanaṃ bandhanamanuśaya ogho yogaścāvidyocyate sūtreṣu /	Further, the Sutra regards ignorance as a separate yoke, a bond, a latent defilement, a canker, a torrent or flood, and a yoke.
na cābhāvamātraṃ tathā bhavitumarhati /	Thus ignorance cannot be a mere negation;
na cāpi cakṣurādayaḥ / tasmāddharmāntaramevāvidyā /	it cannot be everything that is not vidya, the eyes, etc. Yet the prefix "a"—the privative a—has a pejorative sense.
yathā tarhi kubhāryā abhāryetyucyate kuputraścāputraḥ /	One terms a bad wife a "non-wife", and a bad son, a "non-son".
evamavidyā 'pyastu /	Should we not think then that vidya is bad vidya, that is, bad?
kuprajñā cenna darśanāt / kutsitā hi prajña kliṣṭā /	Avidya is not bad prajna, as it is not seeing.
sā ca dṛṣṭisvabhāvā iti nāvidyā yujyate /	Bad prajna would be a type of seeing.
yā tarhi na dṛṣṭiḥ sā bhaviṣyati / sā 'pi bhavituṃ nārhati /	Avidya is the defiled prajna which is not seeing by nature.
kiṃ kāraṇam / dṛṣṭestatsaṃprayuktatvāt	This is impossible because views are associated with ignorance. Moha, which is defined as avidya, is among the mahabhumi kleśas. All the mahabhumi kleśas are associated with them.
avidyā cet prajñā 'bhaviṣyanna dṛṣṭistayā yujyate saṃprāyokṣyata /	Thus avidya is associated with seeing which is prajna in nature.
dvayoḥ prajñādravyayorasaṃprayogāt / itaśca	Avidya is not prajna, for two items of prajna cannot be associated.
prajñopakleśadeśanāt //	Ignorance is defined as a defilement of prajna.
“rāgopakliṣṭaṃ cittaṃ nāvamucyate avidyopakliṣṭā prajñā na viśudhyatī“tyuktam sūtre /	The Sutra says, "The mind defiled by desire is not liberated; prajna defiled by ignorance is not purified.
na ca saiva prajñā tasyāḥ prajñāyā upakleśo yukta iti /	" Now prajna cannot be defiled by prajna.
yathā cittasyānyo bhinnajātīya upakleśo rāga evaṃ prajñāyā avidyā / kiṃ punarevaṃ neṣyate /	If desire is a defilement of the mind, then desire is not the mind; if ignorance is a defilement of prajna, then ignorance is not prajna.
kliṣṭayā prajñayā kuśalā prajñā vyavkīryamāṇā na viśudhyati /	Good prajñā can be mixed with defiled prajñā, as when moments of good and defiled prajñá succeed one another.
ato 'sau tasyā upakleśa iti / yadvāpi rāgopakliṣṭaṃ cittaṃ na vimucyate / kiṃ tadavaśyaṃ rāgaparyavasthitaṃ bhavati /	In the same way, when one says that a mind defiled by desire is not liberated, one is speaking of a mind that is not necessarily associated with craving, but which is oppressed by craving.
uapahataṃ tu tattathā rāgeṇa bhavati yanna vimucyate /	When an ascetic avoids craving, then the mind is liberated.
tāṃ punrbhāvanāṃ vyāvartayato vimucyate / evamavidyopakliṣṭā prajñā na viśudhyatītyavidyopahatāṃ pariklpayāmaḥ /	In the same way prajñā, defiled by ignorance, is not pure: it is oppressed, even when it is good, by ignorance.
ko hi parikalpayan vāryate /	What is capable of arresting the imaginations of a scholar?
jātyantarameva tvavidyāṃ varṇayanti /	Ignorance is not, in its nature, prajñā.
yo 'pi manyate “sarvakleśā avidye“ti tasyāpyata eva vyudāsaḥ /	The scholar who maintains that ignorance is all the defilements is refuted at the same time.
sarvakleśasvabhāvā 'pi satī saṃyojanādiṣu pṛthagnocyeta dṛṣṭyā ca na saṃprayujyeta /	If ignorance is all the defilements, it cannot be named separately among the yokes, etc. ;
anyena vā kleśena dṛṣṭyādīnāṃ paraṃparāsaṃprayogāt cittamapi cāvidyopakleṣṭamevoktaṃ bhavet /	it is not associated with views and with the other defilements; Scripture. Should not say, "The mind, defiled by desire, is not liberated," but rather, "The mind defiled by ignorance. " Do you say that one expresses oneself in this manner in order to be more specific, and that the Sūtra should say, "The mind, defiled by ignorance which consists of desire, is not liberated?
atha mataṃ viśeṣaṇārthaṃ tathoktamiti / prajñāyāmapyavidyāviśeṣaṇaṃ karttavyaṃ bhavet /	" In this hypothesis, Scripture should specify what type of ignorance it is that hinders the purity of the prajñā: now it says, "Prajñā defiled by ignorance is not purified.
bhavatvavidyā dharmāntaraṃ kastu tasyāḥ svabhāvaḥ /	" If you hold that ignorance is a separate dharma, and not merely a certain type of prajñā, you should define it.
satyavanna karmaphalānāmasaṃprakhyānam /	Ignorance is the non-sarṁprakhyāna of the Four Truths, the Three Jewels, of action and its result.
etaccaiva na jñāyate kimidamasaṃprakhyānaṃ nāmeti /	What is non-saeṁprakhyāna?
yadi yanna saṃprakhyānaṃ saṃprakhyānābhāve 'pi tathaiva doṣo yathā avidyāyām /	It is not-saūprakhyāna, nor absence-of-sarprakhyāna, in the same way that gvôdyā is not non-vidyā or absence-of-vrdyā.
atha saṃprakhyānavipakṣabhūtaṃ dharmāntaram /	It is then a certain separate dharma, the opposite of saṁprakhyāna. Good enough;
tadidaṃ tathaiva na jñāyate kiṃ taditi /	but as for ignorance, you have not told us the nature.
evañjātīyako 'pi dharmāṇāṃ nirdeśo bhavati / tadyathā “cakṣuḥ katamat /	Definitions are often thus, that is, not definitions through self nature or essence, but definitions through function.
yo rūpaprasādaścakṣurvijñānasyāśraya” iti /	For example, the eye is defined as “the pure /pa that serves as a support for the eye consciousness” because one does not know this invisible %pa except through inference. In the same way, the unique nature of @vidyā is known through its action or activity; this action is contrary to vidyāāso it is thus a dharma contrary to vidyā.
asmīti sattvamayatā 'vidyete bhadantadharmatrātaḥ /	The Bhadanta Dhatmatrāta defines ignorance in the following terms: afniti śatvamayanā.
kā punarasmimānādanyā mayatā /	Does this mayanā differ from asmimāna?
yā 'sau sūtra uktā “so 'hamevaṃ jñātvā evaṃ dṛṣṭvā sarvāsāṃ tṛṣṇānāṃ sarvāsāṃ dṛṣṭīnāṃ sarvāsāṃ mayatānāṃ sarveṣāmahaṅkāramamakārāsmimānābhiniveśānuśayānāṃ prahāṇāt parijñānānniśchāyo nivṛta” iti /	The Bhadanta answers: As the Sūtra says, “I know, I see— through the perfect abandoning and the perfect knowledge of desire, of views, wayanās, attachments and latent defilements to the idea of self, to the idea of mine, to asmināna, without shade, Parinirvāṇa.”
astyeṣā mayatā /	[This Sūtra shows that v2ayanā—in the singular since it is a genre—is distinct from asmzśmāna]. So be it, there is ayanā;

yata eṣā nānyaḥ kleśaḥ śakyate vaktum /	Because one cannot identify zayanā with any other defilement, since it is named separately from desire, views, and asmúimáṇa.
nanu cānyo māna eva syāt /	But could it not be a gna other than armimāna?
atra punarvicāryamāṇe bahu vaktavyaṃ jāyate /	However we would have to say too much in order to complete this examination.

nāmendriyārthavaśenārtheṣu namatīti nāma / katamasya nāmno vaśena /	The four nonmaterial skandhas,—sensation, ideas, saṁskāras, and consciousness, are called āman, for nāman signifies “that which bends, yields,”. The nonmaterial skandhas bend towards the object by reason of name, the organs, and the object.
yadidaṃ loke pratītaṃ teṣāṃ teṣāmarthānāṃ pratyāyakaṃ gauraśvo rūpaṃ rasa ityevamādi /	In this phrase, “by reason of name,” one takes the word “nare” in its popular sense, as a “designation,” which designates and causes to be understood either a collection, “cattle,” “hoṟses,” etc. , or a single thing, “r%pa,” “taste,” etc. Because the samjñākaraṇa causes the nonmaterial shaendhas to bend towards their object.
etasya punaḥ kena nāmatvam / teṣu teṣv artheṣu tasya nāmno namanāt / iha nikṣipte kāya upapattyantare namanānnāmarupiṇaḥ skandhā ityapare //	According to another explanation, the nonmaterial sbondhas are termed nāman, because, then the body dissolves, these skundhas bend, that is, go towards another existence.

According to the Sūtra, “The coming together, the encounter, the meeting of these dharrnas is contact.”

ṣaṭ bāhyānyāyatanāni / ṣaṭ vijñānakāyāḥ / ṣaṭ sparśakāyāḥ /	According to the ŚSū⁸ra of the Six Hexades, “The six internal sources of consciousness, the six external sources of consciousness, the six consciousness, the six contacts, the six sensations, and the six desires.”

na khalu sarve cakṣurūpe sarvasya cakṣurvijñānasya kāraṇaṃ nāpi sarvaṃ cakṣurvijñānaṃ sarvayoścakṣurūpayoḥ kāryam /	Every eye and visible thing is not the cause of a visual consciousness, as all visual consciousness is not the result of the eye and a visible thing.
ato yeṣāṃ kāryakāraṇābhāvaste sparśabhāve vyavasthāpitā ityeke /	Thus what is defined as contact in the ūtra, “Six collections of contacts,” is the eye, a visible thing and the consciousnesses which are cause and effect.
ye punaḥ saṃnipātādanyaṃ sparśamāhusta etatsūtra kathaṃ pariharanti “iti ya eṣāṃ trayāṇāṃ saṃgatiḥ saṃnipātaḥ samavāyaḥ sa sparśa” iti /	But how do the Sarvāstivadins, who maintain that contact exists apart from the coming together of any eye, a visible thing and a consciousness, explain the Śūtra, “The coming together, the encounter, the meeting of these dharmas is contact?”

cakṣuḥśrotraghrāṇajihvākāyasaṃsparśāḥ pañca pratigha saṃsparśa ityucyate /	The contact of the eye, the ear, etc. , have sapratigha oṟgans for their support ; thus they are termed pra$śgha sparfa taking their name from their support.
sapratighendriyāśrayatvāt / manaḥ saṃsparśaḥ ṣaṣṭhaḥ so 'dhivacanasparśa ityucyate /	The sixth, the contact of the mental organ, is called adhivacanasaṁsparśa.
kiṃ kāraṇaṃ adhivacanamucyate nāma /	What is the meaning of the term adhivacana? Adhivacana is a name.
tatkilāsyādhikamālambanamato 'dhivacanasaṃsparśa iti /	Now name is the object par excellence of contact associated with the mental consciousness.

apare punarāhuḥ / vacanamadhikṛtyārtheṣu manovijñānasya pravṛtti rna pañcānām / atastadevādhivacanam /	According to another opinion, one takes into account the fact that only the mental consciousness is activated withregard to itsmental consciousness is thus adhvacana.

sukhavedyādayastrayaḥ // sukhavedanīyaḥ sparśo duḥkhavedanīyo 'duḥkhāsukhavedanīyaśca /	Three contacts, leading to pleasure, etc. These are contacts that lead to the acquisition of pleasure, of suffering, and of neither pleasure nor suffering. These contacts are so.

yadeva hīdaṃ sahotpannayorjanyajanakabhāvo nāstīti tadevedaṃ jāte dharme dharmasya nāstīti /	This argument only repeats the thesis that two things arisen together cannot be "that which produces" and "that which is produced.
anyonyajanakaprasaṅgattarhi / iṣṭatvādadoṣaḥ /	We would say then that, in your hypothesis, there would be reciprocal causality of two dharmas arisen together. But this is not a fault, for we admit this consequence.

One sensation, having for its cause an earlier contact, exists at the moment of a later contact: thus all contact is accompanied by sensation.
kimatrāyuktam / yaduta bhinnālambanayorapi sparśayoḥ pūrvasparśaitukottarasya vedaneti /	According to you, there would thus be simultaneous contact and a sensation of different objects: a sensation produced by earlier contact of color would exist at the moment of a second contact of sound.

Thus you are forced to an inadmissible conclusion.
astu tarhi tasminkāle sparśabhūtaṃ vijñānamavedanakam /	Let us say then that consciousness is not always contact, and that it is not always accompanied by sensation. The consciousness of color, contemporaneous with the contact of sound, is not contact, but is accompanied by sensation.

sahajātā ityucyate na sparśasahajātā iti kimatra parihāryam /	it does not say that they arise together with contact: we say that they arise together among themselves.
samanantare 'pi cāyaṃ sahaśabdo dṛṣṭastadyathā “maitrīsahagataṃ smṛtisaṃvodhyaṅgaṃ bhāvayatī” tyajñāpakametat /	Let us observe also that the word “together” is used, not only to indicate simultaneity, but also to indicate immediate succession. The Sūtra, for example, says, “He cultivates the part of Bodhi called mindfulness together with compassion. ” Now compassion, which is always “worldly,” evidently cannot be simultaneous to a part of Bodhi: for the parts of Bodhi are always transworldly.
yattarhi sūtra uktaṃ “yā ca vedanā yā ca saṃjñā yā ca cetanā yacca vijñānaṃ saṃsṛṣṭā ime dharmā nāsaṃsṛṣṭā” ityato nāsti vedanābhirasaṃsṛṣṭaṃ vijñānam /	Thus the Sūtra not only does not prove that sensation is simultaneous to contact; it does not even prove that sensation, ideas and volition are associated with, and simultaneous to. From this Sūtra we conclude that there are no sensations, ideas or volitions which are not simultaneous.
saṃpradhāryaṃ tāvadetat ka eṣa samsṛṣṭārthaḥ /	But what is the meaning of the word “mixed”, samshrsta?
tatra hi sūtra evamuktaṃ “yadvedayate taccetayate yaccetayate tastsaṃprajānīte yatsaṃprajānīte tadvijānātī“ti /	We read in the Sūtra that you have just quoted, “That which he feels, he thinks of; that about which he thinks, he grasps an idea of; that about which he grasps an idea of, he discerns. ” In other words, the same thing is the object of sensation, volition, and consciousness.
tanna vijñāyate kim tāvadayameṣāmālambananiyama ukta utāho kṣaṇaniyama iti /	The question is thus posed whether sensation, volition and ideas are called mixed because they have the same object—which is our opinion—or because they are simultaneous, as you say.
āyuruṣmaṇoḥ sāhabhāvye saṃsṛṣṭavacanāt siddhaḥ kṣaṇaniyamaḥ /	The word samshrsta refers to simultaneous things. It is said in fact that life and warmth are samshrta. They cannot be samshrsta except through simultaneity, not by the fact that they would have a common object, since they do not have.
yaccāpi sūtra uktaṃ “trayāṇāṃ saṃnipātaḥ sparśaḥ” iti /	Any object. Furthermore the Sutra says, "The coming together of the three is contact.

“avyābādhamātmabhāvamabhinirvartya savyābādhe loke upapadyata” iti sūtrapadāt /	That abhinirvrtti signifies an intermediate being results from the Sūtra “After having realized a painful body, he will be reborn in a painful world;

dvitīyāntarāparinirvāyiṇaḥ / tṛtīyā 'rhatām /	An Anāgāmin destined to obtain Nirvāṇa in an intermediate existence (an amtarāparinirvāy⁸n, iii. 387): he is bound with the bonds of abhinirvr̥ti, but freed from wpapatti, an Arhat, who has abandoned the two types of bonds;
caturthyetānākārān sthāpayitvā /	and all other persons who are not included in the preceding categories, who have not abandoned any of the two types of bonds.
bhūtāvā 'rhantaḥ saṃbhavaiṣiṇaḥ satṛṣṇāḥ /	According to another explanation, the bhātas are the Arhats: the word saṁbhavaiṣin designates all beings who desire, and who are as a consequence reborn.
atha katyāhārāḥ sattvānāṃ sthitaye kati saṃbhavaiṣiṇāmanugrahāya /	What are the foods that fulfill these two functions of causing to last and “favoring?
sarve 'pyubhayatheti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	” According to the Vaibhāṣikas, the four foods perform these two.
kavaḍīkārāhāro 'pi hi tadrāgiṇāṃ punarbhavāya saṃvartate /	Food by the mouthful has for its result the re-existence of those who are attached to it.
uktaṃ hi /	This is proved by the Sūtra.
bhagavatā “atvāra ime āhārā rogasya mūlalṃ gaṇḍasya śalyasya jarāmaraṇasya pratyaya” iti /	The Blessed One said, “The four foods are the root of sickness, abcesses, and thorns. And are the condition of old age and death.” It is evident that food by the mouthful causes living beings to last.
manaḥsaṃcetanā 'pi ceha sthitaye dṛśyate /	But how does mental intentional action, or volition, possess this power? Once upon a time there was a man, who in a time of poverty desired to go to another land.
evaṃ hi varṇayanti durbhikṣābhyāhatena kīla pitrā putrakau saktava iti bhasmanā bhastrāṃ paripūrya kīlake āsajyāśvāsitau /	But he was exhausted by his hunger and his two sons were young. Feeling that he was going to die, he filled a sack with ashes, placed this sack on a wall, and encouraged his sons by telling them that this sack contained grain.
tau ca tāṃ parikalpayantau ciramapyāsitau kenāpi codghāṭitāyāṃ bhasmeti nairāśyamāpannau vyāpannāviti /	The two children, through hope, lived a long time. But another man came and took the sack and opened it. So too once upon a time some merchants travelled by ship on the open sea; tormented by hunger and thirst, they saw in the distance a mass of foam and believed that it was a river; hope gave them the force to go to that place and prolong their life;
punaśca mahāsamudre bhagnayānapātrāḥ puruṣāḥ sthalamiti mahāntaṃ phenapiṇḍaṃ pradrutāḥ āmṛśya cainaṃ nirāśā uparemuriti /	but, arriving, they found out what it was, and their hopes being crushed, they died.

tatra yāsāṃ mātṛṇāmaṇḍānyārabhya smṛtirna muṣyate tānyaṇḍāni na pūtībhavanti yāsāṃ tu muṣyate tāni pūtībhavanti / tadetanna varṇayanti sautrāntikāḥ /	If the mother forgets the eggs, they will perish.
mā bhūt parakīyeṇāhāreṇāhāra iti /	” This edition cannot be correct, for it is impossible that the mind of another would be food.
evaṃ tu varṇayanti /	Thus we should read, “If the eggs think of their mother, they will not perish;
yeṣāmaṇḍānāṃ mātaramārabhya smṛtirna muṣyate tāni na pūtībhavanti / yeṣāṃ tu muṣyate tāni pūtībhavanti / tasyāḥ sparśāvasthāyāḥ smarantīti / atha kasmāccatvāra evāhārāḥ /	but if they forget their mother, they will perish.
nanu ca sarva eva sāsravā dharmā bhavānāṃ poṣakāḥ / yadyapyetadevaṃ tathāpi pradhānyenoktam	” Yet one cannot doubt that all the impure dharmas increase bhava or existence. Why did the Blessed One teach that the foods are four in number? Because he refers to the essentials.
iha puṣṭyarthamāśrayāśritayordvayam / dvayamanyabhavākṣpanivṛttyarthaṃ yathākramam //	The āśraya and the āśrita are affected by certain foods, while others affect the projection and production of a new existence.
āśrayo hi sendriyaḥ kāyaḥ / tasya puṣṭaye kavaḍīkārāhārāḥ /	The āśraya is the body and its organs, which support the mind and its mental states.
āśritāścittacaittāsteṣāṃ puṣṭaye sparśaḥ /	Food makes the body grow, while contact makes the mind grow.
anayostāvadihotpannasya bhavasya poṣaṇe prādhānyam /	Two foods cause that which is born to live and are similar to a wet-nurse.

pūrvakau hi dvau dhātrīsthānīyau jātasya poṣakatvāt / uttarau mātṛsthānīyau janakatvāditi /	Mental volitional action and consciousness are the two foods that cause birth, similar to a mother, and are major items for the production of the existence of a being who has not yet been born.
yaḥ kaścit kavaḍīkāraḥ sarvaḥ sa āhāraḥ /	Is everything "by the mouthful" food?
syāt kavaḍīkāro nāhāra iti catuṣkoṭikam /	There are “mouthfuls” which ate notfood. Four cases:
prathamā koṭiryaṃ kavaḍīkāraṃ pratītyendriyāṇāmapacayo bhavati mahābhūtānāṃ ca paribhedaḥ /	kavaḍīkāra which is not food: that which, being taken in the mouth, has for its result the diminution of the organs and the destruction of the primary elements which support them;
dvitīyā koṭistraya āhārāḥ /	food without being kavaḍikāra: namely contact, mental volitional action, and the consciousness;
tṛtīyā yaṃ kavaḍīkāraṃ pratītyendriyāṇāmupacayo bhavati mahābhūtānāṃ ca vṛddhiḥ /	kavaḍīkkāra which is food: that which, being taken in the mouth, has for its result the growth of the orgaos and the increase of the primary elements;
caturthyetānākārān sthāpayitvā /	and
evaṃ sparśadibhirapi yathāyogaṃ catuḥkoṭikāni karttavyāni /	neither kavaḍīkāra nor food: sound, etc. The same, by changing the terms, for the other foods.
syāt sparśādīn pratītyendriyāṇāmupacayo mahābhūtānāṃ ca vṛddhirna ca ta āhārāḥ /	Is there contact, mental volitional action, and consciousness, which has for its result the growth of the organs and the increase of the elements, without this contact, etc. , being food?
syādanyabhūmikānanāsravāṃśca /	Yes: those which belong to a sphere different from the sphere in which the being in question is born, and, in all the spheres, those which are pure.
yo 'pi hi paribhukto bhokturbādhāmādadhāti so 'pyāhāra eva /	That which consumed is harmful to one who has consumed it nevertheless receives the name of food.
āpāte 'nugrahāt / dvayorhi kālayorāhāra āhārakṛtyaṃ karoti paribhujyamāno jīryaṃśceti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	According to the Vaibhāṣikas, in fact, it is for two moments that the thing consumed performs the function of food:  as soon as it is consumed, it dispels hunger and thirst; and digested, it increases the organs and the primary elements.
atha kasyāṃ gatau katyāhārāḥ /	This leads to another question. How many foods are there is the different ealms of rebirth, and in the different wombs?
sarvāsu sarve / evaṃ yoniṣvapi / kathaṃ narakeṣu kavaḍīkāra āhāraḥ /	All are in all How can you say that there is, in the hells, food by the mouthful?
pradīptāyaspiṇḍāḥ svathitaṃ ca tāmrām /	‘The red balls of fire and molten copper are food.
yadyūpaghātako 'pyāhāro bhavati catuḥkoṭikaṃ bādhyate prakaraṇagranthaśca “kavaḍīkāra āhāraḥ katamaḥ /	If this is the case, if that which is harmful is food, then the theory of the four cases is rejected, as well as the definitions of the Prakaraṇagrantha which says, “What is food by the mouthful?
yaṃ kavaḍīkāraṃ pratītyendriyāṇāmupacayo bhavati mahābhutānāṃ ca vṛddhiryāpanā 'nuyāpaneti vistareṇa yāvadvijñānam /“	Mouthful by reason of which there is inctease of the organs, and the increase and maintainance of the primary elements,” and the rest.
upacayāhārābhisaṃdhivacanādavirodhaḥ /	‘The doctrine of the existence of food by the mouthful in the hells is not in contradiction with the definitions that you appeal to. These.
apacayāhārastu narakekṣu lakṣaṇaprāptatvāt / so 'pi hi jighatsāṃ pipāsāṃ hantuṃ samartha iti /	But the objects of consummation which have for their result to diminish, nevertheless possess, in the hells, the characteristics of food: they dispel, at least for a time, hunger and thirst.
apitu pratyekanarakeṣu manuṣyavat kavaḍīkārāhārasadbhāvādyuktaṃ pāñcagatikatvam /	Further, in the prādefika Ḥells, food by the mouthful exists as among humans. Hence food by the mouthful exists in the five realms of rebirth.
uktaṃ bhagavatā “yaśca bāhyakānāmṛṣīṇāṃ kāmebhyo vītarāgāṇāṃ śataṃ bhojayedyaścaikaṃ jambūṣaṇḍagataṃ pṛthagajanam / ato dānādidaṃ dānaṃ mahāphalatarami“ti /	With respect to food by the mouthful, let us examine the Sūtra: There is one who feeds one hundred non-Buddhist Ṛṣis detached from Kāmadhātu, and there is one who feeds a single iambuṣaṇḍagata prthagjana: but this last gift is much more fruitful that the first.
ko 'yaṃ jambūṣaṇḍagato nāma pṛthagjanaḥ /	” What does the expression Ś/ambuṣaṇḍagata pṛthagjana’” mean?
jambūdvīpanivāsinaḥ kukṣimanta ityeke /	According to the first opinion, jambuṣaṇḍa signifying Jambudvīpa, so this signifies, “All beings inhabiting Jambudvīpa who have a storhach. ” This explanation is inadmissable; for the expression “a Pr̥thagjana .
tadetanna yuktamekamiti vacanāt / kaścātra viśeṣaḥ /	” cannot designate “allbeings .
syādyadi bhūyasaḥ pṛthagjanān bhojayitvā bhūyaḥ puṇyaṃ syāt nālpīyaso vītarāgāniti /	” Were it to have such a value,We do not see why the Sūtra would teach that a gift made to an infinite number of Pṛthagjanas is more meritorious that one made to a smaller number, to one hundred Ṛṣis: for such would stand of itself, and there would be nothing surprising about it.
saṃnikṛṣṭo bodhisattva ityapare /	According to the second opinion, the Pṛthagjana in question is the Bodhisattva close to Bodhi.
tadetanna varṇayanti “bahutaraṃ hi tasmai datvā puṇyaṃ nārhatkoṭibhya” iti /	According to followers of the third opinion, the second opinion is unsustainable: in fact a gift made to such a Bodhisattva is of incalculable merit, and is of a merit superior to a gift made to one hundred éo¢is of Arṟhats. The terms of the comparison would be much too low.
ato nirvedhabhāgīyalābhī pṛthagjana eṣo'bhipretaḥ iti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	Thus, say the Vaibhāṣīkas, this Prthagjana is the person who has obtained the so-called nôrvedhabhāgīya roots of good. In our opinion, the expression jambuṣaṇḍagata does not etymologically signify “possessor of the nsrvedhabhāgīyas; ” the usage does not give that sense to this expression;
natviyamanvarthā saṃjñā nāpikvacitparibhāṣitā sūtre śāstre vā / jambūṣaṇḍagato nirvedhabhāgīyalābhīti parikalpa evāyaṃ kevalaḥ /	neither the Sūtra nor the Śāstra uses it in this sense: the word jambuṣaṇḍagata, “seated under the Jambu”.
bodhisattva eva tveṣu jambūdvīpaṣaṇḍeṣu niṣaṇṇo yujyate /	The Bodhisattva Sarvārthasiddha sat at the foot of a jambu tree and entered into the First Dhyāna.
sa hi pṛthagjana kāmavairāgyasaṃbandhena tadānīṃ tebhyo viśiṣyamāṇa ukta iti /	The Bodhisattva is detached from Kāmadhātu and a gift made to him is more meritorious than a gift made to Ṛṣis.
anantebhyo 'pi hi sa tebhyo viśiṣyamāṇaḥ /	A gift made to this Bodhisattva is more meritorious than a gift made to an infinite number of Ṛṣis.
śatagrahaṇaṃ tu pūrvādhikārāt /	The Sūtra explains the gradation of merit by multiples of one hundred.
itthaṃ caitadevaṃ yadevaṃ paryudasya bāhyakebhya eva srotāpatti phalapratipannakaṃ viśeṣayāṃbabhūva /	To proceed with these comparisons, the Sūtra does not further speak of a fambuṣaṇḍagata.
anyathā hi jambūṣaṇḍagatādeva vyaśeṣayiṣyat /	It does not say, “A gift made to a candidate for the results of Srotaāpanṇna is incomparable greater than a gift made to ajambuṣaṇḍagata.
ukto yathā sattvānāṃ pratītyasamutpādo yathāvasthitiścyutirapyuktā yathāyuḥkṣayādibhiḥ / idamidānīṃ vaktavyam /	”We have seen what the pratīyasamutpāda of beings is, and how beings last.

chedasaṃdhāna vairāgyahānicyutyupapattyaḥ / manovijñāna eveṣṭāḥ	Breaking, taking up again, detachment, loss of detachment, death and birth are regarded as proper to the mind consciousness.

cyutireva cyutamupapattirudbhavaḥ /	The term çyuea is the equivalent of cyati or death; the term xudbhava is the equivalent of wpapatti, arising.
etāvaduḥkhāsukhāyāṃ vedanāyāṃ bhavatastasyā apaṭutvāt /	The mind consciousness, at death and at birth, is associated with the sensation of indifference, xpekṣa, that is, with the sensation that is neither agreeable nor disagreeable.
itare hi vedane paṭvyau /	This sensation is not active;
na ca paṭuvijñāne cyutyupapattī yujyete /	the other sensations are active and, as a consequence, an aṛising and a dying consciousness cannot be associated with them, for, in this hypothesis, it would itself be active.
tatrāpi ca manovijñāne 'pi naikāgrācittayoretau cyutodbhavāviti vartate /	Death and birth take place in the mind consciousness ,[for andby the manovijñāna).

An absorbed mind is found in a sphere—First Dhyāna, etc—dissimilar to Kāmadhātu where we suppose the one dying and the one being born is found.
nāpyacittasya sā nahyacittaka upakramituṃ śasyeta /	On the other hand, if we consider a being who dies or who is born in aIf his mind is not absorbed, then it is always active.
yadā cāsyāśrayo vipariṇantumārabhate tadāvaśyamasya tadāśrayapratibaddhaṃ cittaṃ saṃmukhībhūya paścāt pracyaveta nānyathā /	An absorbed mind tends to last and cause to last, making it unsuitable for cutting off the series. One without thought, who has entered into nśrodhasamāpatti and asaṁjñisamāpaiti, experiences no death or birth. When the body decays, the mind bound to the body becomes present and dies.
upapattau ca cittacchedahetvabhāvādvinā ca kleśenānupapatterayuktamacittakatvam /	The state of non-thought is incompatible with birth, lacking any cause for cutting off the mind and because there cannot be birth without defilement.
maraṇabhavastriprakāra ityuktam / arhastu nirvātyavyākṛtadvaye /	Existence at death can be good, bad, or neutral.
airyāpathike vipākacitte vā /	Namely, in an airyāpathia mind or in a vipākaja mind.
asti cetkāmadhātau vipāka upekṣā /	At least according to the masters who believe that, in Kāmadhātu, a vipākaja mind can be indifferent;
nāsti cedairyāpathika eva /	but, for the masters of an opposing opinion, one cannot obtain Nirvāṇa in an aryāpathika mind.
kimarthamavyākṛṭa eva nānyasmin /	Why is the last mind of the Arhat necessarily neutral?
tadvi cittacchedānukūlaṃ durbalatvāt /	Because this type of mind, being very weak, is suitable to the cutting off of the mind, that is, to the definitive cutting off of the mind.

mūrdhnītyapare /	but according to another opinion, is the head. How does the consciousness die in a certain part of the body? Because it is in such a part that the destruction of the organ of touch takes place. The activity of the consciousness which is nonmaterial and outside of space, is bound to this organ—which alone remains as its support or asraya. The consciousness dies through the destruction of the organ of touch, which takes place in a certain place.
kāyendriyasya teṣu nirodhāt kāyendriyaṃ hi mriyamāṇasya tapta ivopale jalaṃ niṣṭhyūtaṃ saṃkocamāpadyamānaṃ pādādiṣvantardhīyata iti /	Towards the end of life, the organ of touch perishes bit by bit; at the end it remains only in a certain part of the body where it finishes by disappearing; in the same way water placed on a hot rock diminishes gradually and finishes by disappearing in a certain place.
evaṃ ca punaḥ krameṇa maraṇam /	It is thus that gradual death takes place;

chidyanta iva na ca punastāni kāṣṭhādivacchidyante chinnabadvā punarna ceṣṭanta iti cchinnānyucyante /	By saying that the vital parts are split, we do not mean to say that they are split like wood. Rather one should understand that they are henceforth incapable of activity quite as if they were split.
kasmānna pṛthivīdhātunā / caturthadoṣābhāvāt /	Why are the vital parts not split by trouble of the earth element?
vātapittaśleṣmāṇo hi trayo doṣāḥ / te cāptejovāyudhātupradhānā yathāyogamiti / bhājanalokasaṃvarttanīsādharmyeṇetyapare /	Because there are only three doṛar, namely bile, phlegm, and wind, which are in order the elements of water, fire, and wind. According to another opinion, since the world perishes by these three elements, death also takes place by these three elements.
deveṣu nāsti marmacchedaḥ /	The vital parts of the gods are not split.

ete hi kleśakṣaye niyatatvāt samyaktvaniyatāḥ mokṣabhāgīyalābhino 'pyavaśyaṃ parinirvāṇadharmāṇa iti /	But a person who acquires the mokṣabhāgīyas will also certainly obtain Nirvāṇa.
kasmānna samyaktve niyatāḥ / te hi mithyātve'pi niyatā bhaveyuḥ /	Why not consider him predestined to health? Because he can commit transgressions which make him "predestined to loss;
na ca te kālaniyamena samyaktve niyatā yathā saptakṛtvaḥ paramādayaḥ /	" or rather because, if he is in fact predestined for Nirvāṇa, the moment of his arrival at Nirvāṇa is not fixed, as is the case for the Āryans beginning with "he who, at a maximum, will be reborn seven times".

atha katīmāḥ saṃvartanyaḥ /	The conjunction cz in the stanza shows that one must add the different lengths of time. The continents of Videha and Godānīya do not know the three calamities: yet wickedness, bad color and weakness, and hunger and thirst reign therein when Jambudvīpa is overwhelmed by knives, sickness, and famine. We have described destruction by fire, and have said that the other destructions are accomplished in a similar manner.
saṃvartanyaḥ punastisro bhavantyagnyambuvāyubhiḥ /	There are three destructions: through fire, water, and wind.
ekatra dhyāne sattvāḥ samaṃ saṃvartante etasyāmiti saṃvartanī /	When all beings have disappeared from the lower physical worlds, having come together in a dhyāna heaven, the destructions take place: through fire, by reason of the seven suns; through water, by reason of the rain;

tābhiśca bhājanānāṃ sukṣmo'pyavayavo nāvaśiṣyate /	The effect of these destructions is that not one atom of the destroyed physical world remains.
atra tu kecitīrthaṅkarā icchanti / paramāṇavo nityāste tadānīṃ śiṣyanta iti / kasmātta evamicchanti /	Certain non-Buddhist masters say that the atoms are eternal, and that, as a consequence, they remain when the universe is dissolved.
mā bhūdabījakaḥ sthūlānāṃ prādurbhāva iti /	In fact, say these masters, if it were otherwise, coarse bodies would arise without cause.
nanu ca sattvānāṃ karmajaḥ prabhāvaviśiṣṭo vāyurbījamuktam /	But we have explained that the seed of a new universe is wind, a wind endowed with special powers which have. Their beginning in the actions of creatures.
sarvartanīśīrṣavāyurvātasya nimittaṃ bhaviṣyati /	And the instrumental cause of this wind is the wind of Rūpadhātu which is not destroyed.
“vāyunā lokāntarebhyo bījānyāhriyanta” iti mahīśāsakāḥ sūtre paṭhanti /	Further, a Sūtra of the Mahīśāsakas says that the wind brings the seeds in from another universe.
evamapi na te bījādibhyo'ṅkurādīnāmutpattimicchanti / kiṃ tarhi // svebhya evāvayavebhyasteṣāmapi svebhyaḥ /	But even if the seeds were so brought in, we do not admit that gross bodies,—shoots, stalk, etc. ,—arise from a seed, from a stalk, etc. ;
evaṃ yāvat paramāṇubhyaḥ /	we say rather, that the shoot, etc. , arises from its parts, and that these parts arise in turn from their parts, and so on to the most minute parts which arise from the atoms.
kimidaṃ bījādīnāmaṅkurādiṣu sāmarthyam /	What then is the efficacy of a seed with regard to its shoot?
na kiñcidanyatra tatparamāṇūpasarpaṇāt / kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ ta evamicchanti /	The seed has no efficacy with regard to the generation of the shoot, except that it provokes the aggregation of the atoms of the shoot.
nahi vijātīyātsaṃbhavo yukta iti / kasmānna yuktaḥ /	It is impossible in fact for a certain thing to arise from a thing having another nature: if such generation were possible, there would be no rule in generation. [One could then make mats out of cotton threads]. Different does come from different, butAccording to certain rules, as sound arises, or the products of cooking, etc. The potentiality of all things is determined.
aniyamo hi syāt / śaktiniyamānnaivaṃ bhaviṣyati / śabdapākajotpattivat /	Your examples are not valid.
citro hi guṇadharmo dravyaṃ tu naivam /	We admit that gunadharas or attributes arise either from that which is similar or from that which is different; but this does not hold in the same way for dravyadharmas which arise from the similar things. It is thus that vorapa threads, and not other threads, give rise to a mat, and that only cotton threads give rise to cotton cloth. Your example does not prove this, for it is not, itself, proven.
samānajātīyebhyaḥ eva hi dravyebhyaḥ samānajātīyānāṃ dṛṣṭa utpādastadyathā vīraṇebhyaḥ kaṭasya tantubhyaḥ paṭasyeti / idamayuktaṃ vartate / kimatrāyuktam yadasiddhaṃ sādhanāyodāhriyate / kimatrāsiddham /	You say that a thing arises from a similar thing, since a mat arises from vṝaṇa threads: but, a. mat is the vṝaṇa threads themselves disposed in a certain manner and which take the name of mat;
anyo vīraṇebhyaḥ kaṭo'nyaśca tantubhyaḥ paṭa iti / ta eva hi te yathāsaṃniviṣṭāstāṃ tāṃ saṃjñāṃ labhnte /	cloth is threads disposed in a certain manner.

ekatantusaṃyoge paṭasyānupalambhāt /	When an organ is in relation with a thread, the cloth is not perceived.
ko hi tadā sataḥ paṭasyopalabdhau pratibandhaḥ / akṛtsnavṛttau paṭabhāgo'tra syānna paṭaḥ / samūhamātraṃ ca paṭaḥ syāt /	Now, if the cloth exists why would it not be perceived?
kaśca tantubhyo'nyaḥ paṭabhāgaḥ /	You say that the cloth does not exist, integrally, in each thread: this is to acknowledge that the cloth is only the collection of its parts which are each constituted by a thread: for how would you prove that the parts of a cloth are a thing other than the threads?
anekā śrayasaṃyogāpekṣaṇe daśāmātrasaṃyoge paṭopalabdhiḥ syānna vā kadācit /	You say that the cloth exists integrally in each thread, but that one does not perceive it in each thread because the perception of the cloth supposes a union of the organ and the cloth in such a way that the numerous creative elements of the cloth are perceived: in this hypothesis, it would suffice to see the fringe in order to see the cloth.
madhyaparabhāgānāmindriyeṇāsaṃnikarṣāt / kramasaṃnikarṣe cāvayavānāṃ cakṣuḥsparśanābhyāmavayavavijñānaṃ na syāt /	You say that, if one does not see the cloth when one sees the fringe, it is because the central parts are not in relation with the organ: this is to admit then that one would never see the cloth, for the central parts and the extremes which are supposed to create the cloth. You say that they are perceived successively: this is to acknowledge that the whole is not perceived; and this is to acknowledge too that the idea of cloth or of mat has for its sole object the parts of the cloth or the mat.
tasmātkrameṇa saṃnikarṣādavayavivyavasāyādavayaveṣveva tadbuddhiralātacakravat /	How do we have, from all evidence, the idea of a circle from the circle formed from the circular trajectory of a brand?
bhinnarūpajātikriyeṣu tantuṣu paṭasya rūpādyasaṃbhavāt /	Further, cloth cannot be a thing other than thread, for, in the hypothesis where it would be otherwise, when the threads are different in color, different in nature, and different in disposition, one could not attribute either color, or nature, or disposition to the cloth. You say that the cloth is different in color: this is to acknowledge that different creates different;
citrarūpāditve vijātīyārambho'pi syāt acitre ca pārśvāntare paṭasyādarśanaṃ citradarśanaṃ vā /	further, to suppose that one of the sides is not variegated, in looking at it one would not see the cloth, but rather would see it "variegated. But do you dare say that the cloth, made of threads of different dispositions, is of different dispositions?
kriyā'pi citretyaticitram / tāpaprakāśabhede vā'gniprabhāyā ādimadhyānte tadrūpasparśayoranupapattiḥ /	It would be truly too diverse to be an entity!

For us, the atoms, although suprasensible, become sensible when they come together: the Vaiśeṣikas also attribute the power to create coarse bodies to the united atoms; the factors of visual consciousness should be united in order to produce a consciousness;
teṣāṃ paramāṇuvadekaḥ deśo'tīndriyaḥ /	and persons who suffer from ophthalmia see masses of hair, not hairs one by one.
rūpādiṣveva ca paramāṇusaṃjñāniveśā ttadvināśe siddhaḥ paramāṇuvināśaḥ /	What one understands by atom is physical matter, etc. , it is thus certain that atoms perish at the.

cakṣuḥsparśanagrāhyāṇi ca prajñāyante dagdheṣu corṇākarpāsakusumbhakuṅkumādiṣu tadbuddhyabhāvādrūpādibhedeṣveva tadbuddhiḥ /	The distinction between a thing and its attributes is inadmissible: for no one distinguishes, "This is earth, water, fire: these are the attributes of earth, namely, its color, its taste, etc. " And yet you affirm that a thing, earth, etc. , is perceptible to the eye, etc. Further, when wool, cotton, opium juice, or incense is burned, one no longer has the idea of wool, cotton, etc. , with regard to its ashes: thus the idea has for its object, not a thing in and of itself whose color would be an attribute, but its color, its taste, etc. You say that when an unfired clay jug has been submitted to the action of fire, we say that it has always been the same jug; and that, as a consequence, the jug is a thing other than its color, that it stays the same even though its color changes.
pākajotpattau ghaṭaparijñanaṃ saṃsthānasāmānyāt paṅktivat /	But, inif we were to recognize the unfired jug in the fired jug, it is because its figure remains similar: as one recognizes a row of ants.
cihnamapaśyataḥ parijñānābhāvāt /	In fact, who would recognize the jug if one does not see in it certain characteristics observed initially?
ko vā bālapralāpeṣvādaraḥ iti tiṣṭhatu tāvadevāpratiṣedhaḥ /	Let us here stop this discussion of these infantile theories.
atha kasyāḥ saṃvartanyāḥ katamacchīrṣa bhavati /	What is the upper limit of the destructions?
dhyānatrayaṃ dvitīyādi śīrṣa tāsām yathākramam // trīṇi saṃvartanīśīrṣāṇi /	Three Dhyāṇnas, beginning with the second, are, in order, the top of the destructions; by reason of the community of the nature of destructions and the vices of the first three Dhyānas. As for the Fourth Dhyāṇa, no destruction, by reason of its non-agitation: this is not that it is eternal, for its mansions are produced and perish along with the beings who live therein.
tejaḥsaṃvartanyā dvitīyaṃ dhyānaṃ śīrṣaṃ bhavatyadho dahyate /	The Second Dhyāna is the limit of the destruction by fire: everything below it is burned;

pratheme hi dhyāne vitarkavicārā apakṣālāḥ /	in fact, the vice or imperfection of the First Dhyāna is vitarka-vicāra;
te ca manasaḥ paridāhakatvādagnikalpāḥ /	these burn the mind and are thus similar to fire.
dvitīye prītirapakṣālaḥ sā ca prasrabdhiyogenaśrayamṛdūkaraṇādapkalpāḥ /	The Second Dhyāṇna perishes by water: in fact, it has joy for its vice. This, being associated with physical well-being, rends the body soft and flabby: it is similar to water.
ata evatasmin kṛtsnakāyakrauryāpagamāt duḥkhendriyasya nirodha uktaḥ sūtre /	This is why the Sūtra teaches that the sensation of suffering is destroyed by the suppression of all solidity of the body.
tṛtīye dhyāne āśvāsapraśvāsāḥ / te ca vāyava eva /	The ThirdDhyāna perishes by wind: in fact, it has inbreathing and outbreathing, which are wind,for its vice.

pṛthivyeva hi bhājanākhyā tasyāṃ tejojalavāyubhirvirodho na pṛthhivyeti / atha caturthadhyāne kathaṃ na saṃvartanī /	What one calls the physical world is earth, and as a consequence can be opposed by fire, water, and wind, but not by earth itself.
na caturthe'styaniñjanāt /	The Fourth Dhyāna is not subject to destruction, because it is free from agitation.
caturthaṃ dhyānamādhyātmikāpakṣālarahitatvādāneñja muktaṃ bhagavatā /	The Buddha said in fact that this Dhyāna, being free from internal vices, is non-movable.
ato'tra bāhyo'pakṣālo na pravartata iti nāstyatra saṃvartanī /	The external vices have thus no hold on it and, as a consequence, it is not subject to destruction.
śuddhāvāsaprabhāvādityapare /	According to another opinion, the non-destruction of the Fourth Dhyāna is explained by the force of the Śuddhāvāsakāyika gods whose abode it is.
nahi taiḥ śakyamārupyān praveṣṭuṃ nāpyanyatra gantumiti / nityaṃ tarhi caturthadhyānabhājanaṃ prāpnnoti /	These gods are incapable of entering into Ārūpyadhātu, and are also incapable of going elsewhere.
na nityaṃ saha sattvena tadvimānodayavyayāt // nahi caturthaṃ dhyānamekabhūmisaṃbaddham / kiṃ tarhi /	The receptacle world of the Fourth Dhyāṇa is not eternal, but by this fact, it does not constitute a “sphere;
vicchinnasthānāntaraṃ tārakāvat /	” like the stars, it is divided into diverse residences;
tatrāpyayaṃ sattva upapadyeta cyaveta vā / sa sārdhaṃ vimāneneti nāstyasya nityatvam /	these different mansions, the abodes of beings, arise and perish with these beings.

tejasā saptakaḥ	After seven series of seven successive destructions by fire, destruction is then done seven times by water;
etena krameṇāpsaṃvartanīnāṃ gate saptake punaḥ tejaḥsaṃvartanīnāṃ saptako bhavati / paścādvāyusaṃvartanī tataḥ //	the eighth series of seven destructions by fire is followed by one destruction by wind.
paścādekāvāyusaṃvartanī bhavati / kiṃ kāraṇam /	The physical worlds, in fact, last by reason of the duration of the gods who are reborn therein by the force of their absorptions.

oṃ namo buddhāya / atha yadetatsattvabhājanalokasya bahudhā vaicitryamukta tat kena kṛtam /	Karma OR Homage to the Buddha Who created the variety of the world of living beings and the receptacle-world which we have described in the preceding chapter?
na khalu kenacidbuddhipūrvakaṃ kṛtam /	It was not a god who intelligently created it. The variety of the world arises from action.
kiṃ tarhi / sattvānāṃ karmajaṃ lokavaicitryaṃ	The variety of the world arises from the actions of living beings.
yadi karmajaṃ kasmātsattvānāṃ karmabhiḥ kuṅkumacandanādayo ramyatarā jāyante na teṣāṃ śarīrāṇi /	But, in this hypothesis, how does it happen that actions produce at one and the same time, pleasing things, saffron, sandalwood, etc, on.
karmāṇyeva tānyevañjātīyāti vyābhiśrakāriṇāṃ sattvānāṃ yadāśrayāśca vraṇabhūtā jāyante bhogāśca ramyāstatpratīkārabhūtāḥ /	The actions of beings whose conduct is a mixture of good and bad actions produce bodies resembling abscesses whose impurities flow out through the nine gates, and, in order to serve as a remedy to these bodies, they also produce objects of pleasing enjoyment, colors and shapes, odors, tastes and tangibles.
avyāmiśrakāriṇāṃ tu devānāmubhaye 'pi ramyāḥ /	But the gods have accomplished only good actions: their bodies and their objects of enjoyment are equally pleasing.
kiṃ punastatkarmetyāha	What is action?
cetanā tatkṛtaṃ ca tat /	It is volition and that which is produced through volition.
sūtra uktaṃ “dve karmaṇī cetanā karma cetayitvā ce“ti / yattaccetayitvā cetanākṛṭaṃ ca tat /	The sutra says that there are two types of action, volition and the action after having been willed. Action after having been willed is what the karika designates by the words "that which is produced through volition.
te ete dve karmaṇī trīṇi bhavanti / kāyavāṅmanaskarmāṇi /	These two actions form three actions: bodily action, vocal action, and mental action.
kathameṣāṃ karmaṇāṃ vyavasthānam / kimāśrayataḥ āhosvit svabhāvataḥ samutthānato vā /	How do you establish this division, according to the support of its action, according to its nature, or according to its original cause?
āśrayataścedekaṃ kāyakarma prāpnoti /	If one were to regard its support, there is nothing but an action, for all actions are supported on a physical support, a body.
sarveṣāṃ kāyāśritatvāt svabhāvataścedvākkarmaikaṃ prāpnoti / vacasaḥ karmasvabhāvatvāt /	If one were to regard its nature, there is only vocal action, for, of these three, body, speech and anas, only the voice is ultimately action by its nature.
samutthānataścenmanaskarmaikaṃ prāpnoti / sarveṣāṃ manaḥ samutthitatvāt /	If one were to regard its original cause, we have only mental action, for all actions have their origin in the mind.
yathākramaṃ tribhiḥ kāraṇaistrayāṇāmiti vaibhāṣikāḥ / tatra punaḥ	The Vaibhāṣikas say that the three types of action are established by reason of all of these three causes, support, nature and original cause, in this order.
cetanā mānasaṃ karma	Volition is mental action: it gives rise to two actions, bodily and vocal action.
cetanā manaskarme ti veditavyam /	Volition is called mental action;
tajjaṃ vākkāyakarmaṇī // yattaccetanājanitaṃ cetayitvā karmetyuktaṃ kāyavākkarmaṇī te veditavye /	that which arises from volition, namely action which has been willed, is made up of the two other actions, bodily and vocal action.
te tu vijñaptyavijñaptī	These two actions are informative and non-informative.
te tu kāyavākkarmaṇī pratyekaṃ vijñaptyavijñaptisvabhāve veditavye /	Bodily action and vocal action are informative and noninformative;
tatra tu kāyavijñaptiriṣyate /	we then have bodily informative. What action is “bodily informative action?
saṃsthānaṃ	” Bodily vrjñapti is shape. It is not movement because all conditioned things are momentary, since they perish: on the other hand, pothing does not perish without a cause and the creative cause would be at the same time destructive.
cittavaśena kāyasya tathā tathā saṃsthānaṃ kāyavijñaptiḥ / gatirityapare / prasyandamānasya hi kāyakarma no 'prasyandamānasyeti / ta ucyante	Bodily viñapti is such and such a shape of the body by reason of a volition According to others, bodily vijñapti is displacement, for it takes place when there is movement, and not when there is no movement.
na gatiryasmātsaṃskṛtaṃ kṣaṇikaṃ	The author answers: This is not so, because all conditioned things áre Tṉnoeṇtary.
ko 'yaṃ kṣaṇo nāma / ātmalābho 'nantravināśī /	What is understood by “momentary” ?
so 'syāstīti kṣaṇikam /	Kṣaṇa means to perish immediately after having acquired its being;
daṇḍakavat /	ksaṇika īs a āharma that has kṣaṇa, as a daṇḍika is one who has a staff.
sarva hi saṃskṛtamātmalābhā dūrdhvaṃ na bhavatīti yatraiva jātaṃ tatraiva dhvasyate /	A conditioned thing does not exist beyond the acquisition of its being;
tasyāyuktā deśāntarasaṃkrāntiḥ /	it perishes on the spot where it arises; it cannot go from this spot to another.
tasmānna gatiḥ kāyakarma /	Consequently bodily v/ñapti is not movement.
syādetadeva yadi sarvasya ṣkṇikatvaṃ sidhyet / siddhamevaitat viddhi / kutaḥ / saṃskṛtasyāvaśyaṃ /	If conditioned things are momentary, we would admit that they are not susceptible of displacement.
vyayāt //	It is proven that they are momentary, "since they necessarily perish;
akasmiko hi bhāvānāṃ vināśaḥ /	" for the destruction of conditioned things is spontaneous; it does not come from anything;
kiṃ kāraṇam /	it does not depend on a cause.
kāryasya hi kāraṇaṃ bhavati / vanāśaścābhāvaḥ /	That which depends on a cause is an effect, something "done," "created.
yaścābhāvastasya kiṃ kartavyam /	Destruction is a negation: how can a negation "be done" or "created? " Therefore destruction does not depend on a cause. Destruction does not depend on a cause: hence a conditioned thing perishes as soon as it arises;
so 'sāvākasmikok vināśo yadi bhāvasyotpannamātrasya na syāt paścādapi na syādbhāvasya tulyatvāt /	if it did not perish immediately, it would not perish later, since it would then remain the same. Since you admit that it perishes, you must admit that it immediately perishes. Would you say that a conditioned thing changes and that, consequently, it is later subject to destruction? It is absurd to say that a certain thing changes, becoming another thing, staying the same thing that you say shows its modified characteristics.
tathānyathībhūtaḥ / na yuktaṃ tasyaiva /	There are many remarks to make with respect to this.
nyathātvam / na hi sa eva tasmādvilakṣaṇo yujyate / dṛṣṭo vai kāṣṭhādīnāmagnyādisaṃyogādvināśaḥ /	In fact, people do not directly perceive the destruction of kindling by reason of fire.
na ca dṛṣṭādgariṣṭhaṃ pramāṇamastīti / na ca sarvasyākasmiko vināśaḥ kathaṃ tāvat bhavān kāṣṭhādīnāmagnyādisaṃyogādvināśaṃ paśyāmīti manyate / teṣāṃ punaradarśanāt /	If you think that kindling perishes through its relationship to fire because we no longer see the kindling when this relationship has taken place, then your thesis rests on an inference, and not on direct perception, and your reasoning is not conclusive. The fact that we no longer see kindling after its relationship with fire is open to two interpretations: either the kindling perishes by reason of this relationship, or itunceasingly perishes in and of itself, and under normal conditions isunceasingly reborn in and of itself, but stops renewing itself by virtue of its relationship with the fire.
saṃpradhāryaṃ tāvadetat /	You admit that the destruction of the flame is spontaneous.
kimagnisaṃyogātkāṣṭhādayo vinaṣṭā ato na dṛśyante utāho svayaṃ vinaṣṭā anye ca punarnotpannā ato na dṛśyante /	When, after a relationship with wind, the flame is no longer visible, you admit that this relationship is not the cause of the destruction of the flame;
yathā vāyusaṃyogātpradīpaḥ pāṇisaṃyogādghaṇṭāśabda iti /	but you admit that the flame, by virtue of this relationship, stops renewing itself. The same for the sound of the bell: a hand, laid on the bell, prevents a renewing of its sound; but it does not destroy the sound that you admit is momentary.
tasmādanumānasādhyo 'yamarthaḥ /	Therefore it is inference that should determine this question.
kiṃ punaratrānumānam /	The Vatsīputrīyas: What reasons do you bring to bear in favor of the thesis of spontaneous destruction?
uktaṃ tāvat akāryatvādabhāvasyeti /	We have already said that destruction, being a negative state, cannot be caused.
punaḥ na kasyacidahetoḥ syāt	We would further say that if destruction is the effect of a cause, nothing would not perish without a cause.
yadi vināśo hetusāmānyānna kasyacidahetukaḥ syādutpādavat /	If, like arising, destruction proceeds from a cause, it would never take place without a cause.
kṣaṇikānāṃ ca buddhiśabdārciṣāṃ dṛṣṭa ākasmiko vināśa iti nāyaṃ hetumapekṣate /	Now we hold that intelligence, a flame, or a sound, which are momentary, perish without their destruction depending on a cause.
yastu manyate buddhyantarādbuddhervināśaḥ śabdāntarācchabdasyeti /	Hence the destruction of the kindling, etc. , is. The Vaibhāṣikas maintain that an earlier thought perishes by reason of a later thought, that earlier sound perishes by reason of later sound.

na hi śaṃsayaniścayajñānayoryuktaṃ samavadhānaṃ sukhaduḥkhayo rāgadveṣayorvā /	Some contradictory thoughts:—doubt and certainty, pleasure and suffering, love and hate,—do not displace one another; and the same holds for non-contradictory thoughts.
yadā ca paṭubuddhiśabdānantaramapaṭubuddhiśabdāvutpadyete tadā kathamapaṭuḥ samānajātīyo dharmaḥ paṭīyāṃsaṃ hiṃsyāt /	And if you suppose that they do contradict one another, then how can weak dharmas destroy strong dharmas of the same type—as when weak thoughts or sounds immediately follow strong thoughts or sounds?
antyayośca kathaṃ yo 'pyarciṣāmavasthānahetvabhāvāddharmādharmavaśādvā vināśaṃ manyate tadapyayuktam /	Some think that a flame perishes through the absence of a cause of duration.
na hyabhāvaḥ kāraṇaṃ bhavitumarhati /	But an absence cannot be a cause. According to the Vaiśeṣikas, flame perishes by reason of dharma anṇd adharma, merit and demerit. This explanation is inadmissible. Dharma and adharmma would both be causes of arising and of destruction: harma would cause the flame to arise and cause it to perish, accordingly as the flame is favorable orAccordingly as it is unfavorable or favorable.
na cāpyutpādavināśahetvordharmārdharmayoḥ kṣaṇe kṣaṇe vṛttilābhapratibandhau bhavitumarhataḥ /	Now we cannot admit that dharma and adharma enter into activity and cease being active from moment to moment.
sakyaṣcaiṣa kāraṇa parikalpaḥ sarvatra samskṛte kartumityalaṃ vivādena /	Furthermore since this manner of explaining destruction would hold for all conditioned things, it is useless to pursue the discussion. You do not have the right to say that kindling perishes through its relationship with the flame.
yadi ca kāṣṭhādīnāmagnyādisaṃyogahetuko vināśaḥ syādevaṃ sati pākajānāṃ guṇānāṃ pakvataratamotpattau hetuḥ syācca vināśakaḥ / hetureva ca vināśakaḥ syāt / kathaṃ kṛtvā /	If one holds that the destruction of the kindling, etc. , has for its cause the relationship of this kindling with fire, one would then be forced to acknowledge that a cause that engenders is at the same time a cause that destroys.

The same cause that produces the first color destroys this first color, or, at least—if you object that it refers to a new relationship with fire, since the fire is momentary—the cause that destroys the first color is similar to the cause that produces it. Now it is impossible that a certain cause would.
na ca yuktaṃ yata eva tādṛśāddvā teṣāṃ bhāvastata eva tādṛśācca teṣāṃ punarabhāva iti /	Produce a certain effect and that later this same cause, ora parallel cause, would destroy this same effect.
jvālāntareṣu tāvaddhetubhedakalpanāṃ parikalpeyuḥ /	Would you say that, if the successive flames are different—long, short, large and small,—our conclusion does not become indispensable? Let us use another example.
kṣarahimaśuktasūryodakabhūmisaṃbandhāttu pākajaviśeṣotpattau kāṃ kalpanāṃ kalpayeyuḥ /	By the prolonged action of ashes, snow, caustics, sun, water, or earth, there arises and disappears in turn different “products of cooking.” But you do not attribute the characteristic of momentariness to these diverse factors of cooking.
yattarhyāpaḥ kvāthyamānāḥ kṣīyante kiṃ tatrāgnisaṃyogāḥ kurvanti /	Some ask why water diminishes when it is heated if a relationship with fire is not destruction of the water?
tejodhātuṃ prabhāvato vardhayanti yasya prābhāvādapāṃ saṃghātaḥ kṣāmakṣāmo jāyate yāvadatikṣāmatāṃ gato 'nte na punaḥ saṃtānaṃ saṃtanoti /	By reason of its relationship with fire, through the force of the fire, the heat element—which is present in water—increases and, increasing, causes the mass of water to be reborn in quantities more and more reduced, until being totally reduced, the water ceases renewing itself. This is what a relationship with fire does to water.
idamatrāgnisaṃyogāḥ kurvanti /	This is what a relationship with fire does to water.

Thus, there is no movement or displacement, only arising in another place of the second moment of the series. This is even true for fire consuming firewood. The idea of movement is a false conception.
gatyabhāve ca “saṃsthānaṃ kāyavijñapti“riti siddham /	Bodily vôiñapti is not displacement or movement, but rather shape.
nāsti saṃsthānaṃ dravyata iti sautrāntikāḥ /	The Sautrāntikas say that shape is not a distinct thing, but only a designation.
ekadiṅmukhe hi bhūyasi varṇa utpanne dīrghaṃ rūpamiti prajñapyate /	When there arises a large mass of color in one direction, this mass is called "long.
tamevāpekṣyālpīyasi hrasvamiti /	" When a mass of color is small by comparison, it is.
caturdiśaṃ bhūyasi caturasramiti /	When a color arises in a great quantity in the four directions, it is called "square.
sarvatra same vṛttamiti /	When it arises equally in all directions, it is called "circular.
evaṃ sarvam /	The other figures - high, low, etc. - are explained in the same manner.

In fact, seeing through the organ of sight, one has the idea of length, etc. ; touching through the tactile organ, one has the idea of length.
yathā vā spraṣṭavye dīrghādigrahaṇaṃ tathā varṇe saṃbhāvyatām /	Thus if length, or any other shape, were a thing in and of itself, it would be perceived by two organs.
smṛtimātraṃ tatra spraṣṭavyasāhacaryāt bhavati /	Now, according to the scriptural definition, rupayaana, the visible physical matter, is perceived by only the eye. The Vaibhashikas answer that touch does not perceive length relative to softness or hardness, arranged in a certain manner, without length forming part of the tangible.
sa tu sāhacaryāt bhavati na tu sākṣāt grahaṇam /	The Vaibhāṣikas: When we have the idea of length after having touched something, we are not perceiving shape through touch;
yathā 'gnirūpaṃ dṛṣṭvā tasyoṣṇatāyāṃ smṛtirbhavati puṣpagandhaṃ ca ghrātvā tadvarṇa iti /	we remember the shape, because it is associated with a tangible. It is the same when we see the color of fire, for we then remember heat; and when we smell the odor of flower, we then remember its color. In the two cases that you allege, one imagines that a color recalls a tangible, or that an odor recalls color, because the dharmas as cause are closely associated: all fire is hot, and certain odors belong to certain flowers.
yuktamatrāvyabhicāratvādanyenānyasya smaraṇaṃ natu kiñcit spraṣṭavyaṃ kvacit saṃsthāne niyataṃ yatastatra smaraṇaṃ niyamena syāt /	But a tangible is not invariably associated with a certain shape: how then does the perception of a tangible provoke the remembrance of a certain shape?
athāsatyapi sāhacaryaniyame saṃsthānasmaraṇaṃ niyamena syāt / varṇe 'pi syāt varṇavaddhā saṃsthāne 'pyaniyamena syāt /	If a similar remembrance is produced without there having been an invariable association between a tangible and its shape, one would in this same manner remember color after. Having touched something.
nacaivaṃ bhavati /	But such is not the case.
ayuktamasya spraṣṭavyātsmaraṇaṃ /	Hence, one must not say that the perception of a tangible provokes the remembrance of its shape. Second argument.
citrāstaraṇevā 'nekavarṇasaṃsthāne darśanādbahūnāmaikadeśyaṃ prāpnuyāt /	One sees many shapes in a multicolored piece of cloth. Thus, there would be, according to you, many rpas, in the category of shape inone and the same piece: this is impossible, as itwas for color. If shape were a real thing, that which, in the cloth, forms part of a long line cannot at the same time form a part of a short line. Third argument. All "real' r%%pa, susceptible of being struck,-blue, etc. .
taccāyīuktaṃ varṇavat / tasmānnāsti dravyataḥ saṃsthānam /	-is made up of real atoms of a certain nature: color rpa necessarily exists in the octuple atom, etc. Now.

na cāṇau tat na ca saṃsthānaṃ paramāṇau vidyate dīrghādi /	There is no atom of length. In fact, when a long mass diminishes, we arrive at the moment when we no longer have the idea of long with regard to it, but rather the idea of short: hence this idea does not proceed from a rūpa "shapeʼ existing in the thing.
tasmādbahuṣveva tathā saṃniviṣṭeṣu dīrghādiprajñaptiḥ /	Therefore what we designate.
atha mattaṃ saṃsthānaparamāṇava eva tathā saṃniviṣṭā dīrghādisaṃjñāṃ labhanta iti / so 'yaṃ kevalaḥ pakṣapātasteṣāmasiddhatvāt / siddhasvalakṣāṇānāṃ hi teṣāṃ saṃcayo yujyate /	If you maintain that the expressions, "long," etc. refer to some atoms of shape arranged in a certain manner, and that some atoms that would not be "shape" by nature could not be designated as "long," etc—this is merely repeating your affirmation without the support of any argument.
na ca saṃsthānāvayavānāṃ varṇādivat svabhāvaḥ siddha iti kuta eṣāṃ saṃcayaḥ /	In fact, if the existence of special atoms of shape were proved, you would be able to maintain that united, arranged in a certain fashion, they constitute length: but since the existence of these atoms has not been proved, as the existence of the atoms of color has been proved, how could they be united and arranged?
yattarhi varṇaścābhinno bhavati saṃsthānaṃ ca bhinnaṃ dṛśyate mṛdbhājanānām /	If a shape is not distinct in color, if a shape is nothing other than a certain color, then shapes would not differ when their color is the same: now some jugs of the same color have different shapes.
nanu coktaṃ yathā kṛtvā varṇe dīrghādisaṃjñā prajñapyate tathā ca pipīlikādīnāmabhede paṅkticakrādīnāṃ bhedaḥ prajñāyate tathā saṃsthānasyāpi	Have we not said that one designates a number of real things arranged in a certain manner as "long? Some ants, all similar, arrange. In the same way the shapes of jugs differ without their color differing.
yattarhi tamapi dūrādvā varṇamapaśyantaḥ sthāṇvādīnāṃ dairghyādīni paśyanti varṇameva te tatrāvyaktaṃ dṛṣṭvā dīrghādiparikalpaṃ kurvanti /	But, in darkness or at a distance, one sees the shape of an object,—a column, a person, etc. ,— without seeing its color. Hence shape exists separate from color. In fact, one first sees color in an indistinct manner;
paṅktisenāparikalpavat / itthaṃ caitadevam / yatkadācidanirdhāryamāṇaparicchedaṃ saṃghātamātramavyaktaṃ dṛśyate kimapyetaditi /	one then forms—through the mental consciousness—the idea of shape, in the same way that one forms the idea of a line, or the idea of an army accordingly as one has seen, indistinctly, some birds, some ants, some elephants, etc: “This army is arranged in a circle”. Or rather it happens that one does not clearly distinguish either color or shape; one only knows—through the mental consciousness—a mass.
athedānīṃ kāyasya gatiṃ nirākṛṭya samsthānaṃ ca tatra bhavantaḥ sautrāntikāḥ kāṃ kāyavijñarptiṃ prajñapayanti /	You Sautrantikas negate both movement and shape. Then what is designated by the term “bodily vrjñapñ?
saṃsthānameva hi te kāyavijñarpti prajñapayanti / natu punardravyataḥ /	” 'We say that bodily vrjñapi is shape [thus separating ourselves from the Vatsiputriyas-Sarmitiyas] but we do not say that shape is a thing in.
tāṃ ca prajñapayantaḥ kathaṃ kāyakarma prajñapayanti /	If you maintain that bodily vs/ñapti is not a real thing, but solely a shape that exists as designation, what then is the real dharma that constitutes bodily action?
kāyādhiṣṭhānaṃ karma kāyakarma yā cetanā kāyasya tatra tatra praṇetrī /	Bodily action is the action which has for its object the body: that is to say, the volition that puts a body into motion in diverse ways: it proceeds by being supported on this gate which is the body, and is thus called bodily action.
evaṃ vāṅmanaskarmaṇī api yathāyogaṃ veditavye /	Other actions should be defined according to their natures: ie. , vocal action is the action which has the voice for its object; mental action is the action of the anas or action associated with the manas. If bodily action and vocal action are volition, what difference is there between the two types of action defined in this scripture? There are two types of volition.
yattarhi “cetanā karma cetayitvā ce“tyuktaṃ saṃkalpacetanā pūrvaṃ bhavatyevaṃ saṃkalpacetanā pūrvaṃ bhavatyevaṃ caivaṃ ca kariṣyāmīti /	First, the initial or preparatory stage, wherein one produces a volition which is pure volition, I must do such and such an action”;
tathā cetayitvā paścāt kriyā cetanotpadyate /	this is what the Scripture calls cetanākarman.
yayā kāyaḥ preryate sā 'sau cetayitvā karmetyucyate /	One produces a volition of action, the volition of doing an action in conformity with what has been previously willed, to move the body or to emit a voice: this is what the Scripture calls ce¢ayitvā karmam, action after having been willed, or willed action. If this is the case, then informative action does not exist: bodily-vocal action, according to you, is only volition; there is no place for the vrñap#i which is matter by its nature.
evaṃ tarhi vijñaptyabhāvādavijñaptirapi kāmāvacarī nāstīti mahānto doṣā anuṣajyante / anuṣaṅgānāṃ punaḥ pratyanuṣaṅgā bhaviṣyanti /	And if viñapti does not exist, then v/jñapti,“non-information”” of the sphere of Kāmadhātu,does not exist. From whence there would be a great number of difficulties which will be enumerated later (ie. , saṁvarāsaṁvarābhãáva, etc. , see below 4a-b). These difficulties can be refuted. Av#ñapri is explained very well in our system.
yadi tasmādeva kāyakarmasaṃśabditāccetanāviśeṣādavijñaptiḥ syāt /	We admit two types of volition bearing on bodily actions and vocal sounds which are the bodily and vocal vṝjñaptis. These two types of volitions—which bear the names of bodily action and vocal. Where is the difficulty in this?
cittānuparivartinī syātsamāhitavijñaptivat nai vaṃ bhaviṣyati /	This s% generis volition is subordinate to the mind, like the eviñapti which in our system arises from dhyāna, for the avijñapti of Kāmadhātu develops during sleep, etc. No, for this s%.
cetanāviśeṣeṇa tadākṣpaviśeṣāt /	generis volition is projected by a certain volition of decision, its distant cause, and by a certain volition of action and voice, its near cause.
sā 'pi ca vijñaptiḥ satī tadākṣepe cetanāyā balaṃ nibhālayate /	Now however you would have it that the vijñapti, if it exists, would depend, like the projection of the evġjñapti, on the force of the thought: for it is itself nonintelligent.
jaḍatvāt / dravyameva tu saṃsthānaṃ vaibhāṣikā varṇayanti saṃsthānātmikāṃ tu kāyavijñaptim /	The Vaibhāṣikas say that shape exists in and of itself, and that bodily vijñapti is shape.
vāgvijñaptistu vāgdhvaniḥ //	Vocal vijñapti is vocal sound.
vāksvabhāvo yaḥ śabdaḥ saiva vāgvijñaptiḥ /	Sound whidch is discourse by nature—that is, articulated sound (ii. 47)—is vocaḻ viñapti.
avijñaptiḥ pūrvamevoktā /	Avijñapti has already been defined.
sā 'pi dravyato nāstīti sautrāntikāḥ / abhyupetyākaraṇamātratvāt /	The Santrāntikas say that the avsjñapt# does not really exist as a substance: because it solely consists of not doing an action after.
atītānyapi mahābhūtānyupādāya prajñaptesteṣāṃ cāvidyamānasvabhāvatvādrūpalakṣaṇābhāvācca / astīti vaibhāṃṣikāḥ /	because one designates a thing which would exist by reason of past primary elements as evijñapti; now past dharmas no longer exist;
kathaṃ jñāyate / trividhāmalarūpoktivṛddhyakurvatpathādibhiḥ /	and because avijñapti does not have the nature of rupa, the nature of rupa is rupyate and since the aviñapti is not "susceptible of destruction", it cannot be rupa.
trividhaṃ rūpamuktaṃ sūtre /	Scripture says that rupa is of three types and that there is a pure rupa; there is increase of merit;
“tribhiḥ sthānai rūpasya rūpasaṃgraho bhavati / asti rūpaṃ sanidarśanaṃ sapratigham /	and there is a course of action for him who is not concerned with himself, etc. A scripture says that there are three types of rupa: "Rupa is embraced within a threefold rupa: there is visible rupa susceptible of destruction;
asti rūpamanidarśanaṃ sapratigham /	there is an invisible rupa susceptible of destruction;
asti rūpamanidarśanamapratighami“ti /	and there is an invisible rupa, free from destruction," and this latter can only be the avijñapti.
anāsravaṃ ca bhagavatā rūpamuktam / “anāsravāḥ dharmāḥ katame /	The Blessed One said in a scripture that there is pure rupa: "What are the pure dharmas? All rupa of the past, the future and the present.

kṛte 'pi ca tasyāḥ svabhāvaviśeṣāditi /	But it is evident that the nature of this action is not modified by the execution of the order.
uktaṃ ca bhagavatā “dharmā bhikṣavo bāhyamāyatanamekādaśabhirāyatanairasaṃgṛhītamanidarśanamapratighami“ti /	The Blessed One said, “Monks, the dharmas, the external sources of consciousness not included within the eleven āyatanas, are invisible, and are free from destruction”.
na tvarūpītyuktam /	He did not say that the dharmāyatana īs non-rūpa.
tatra kiṃ prayojanaṃ syādyadi dharmāyatanāntargatamavijñaptirūpaṃ naśyeta /	If the Blessed One did not intend to refer to the avġiñapti, which is rūpa and so included in the dharmāyatana, then what is the rāpa that is included in the dharmāyatana?
aṣṭāṅgaśca mārgo na syādavijñaptimantareṇa / samāpannasya samyagvākkarmāntājīvānāmayogāt /	If avijñap does not exist, the Way no longer has eight parts, for the parts, samyagvākc, samyakkarmānta, and samyagājīva (correct speech, correct action, and correct livelihood, iv. 86), are incompatible. with absorption. If the ascetic, in a state of absorption, possesses these three, it is because these three are by nature.
yattarhīdamuktaṃ “tasyaivaṃ jānata evaṃ paśyataḥ samyagdṛṣṭirbhāvanāparipūriṃ gacchati samyak saṃkalpaḥ samyak vyāyāmaḥ samyak smṛtiḥ samyak samādhiḥ /	One would answer, a scripture says, "When he knows thus, when he sees thus, samyagdrṣṭi, samyaksaṁkalp gvyāyãma, samyaksmrti, and samyaksamādhi are cultivated and achieved;
pūrvameva cāsya samyak vāvakrmāntājīvāḥ pariśuddhā bhavanti paryavadātā” iti /	sangyagvāc, samyakkarmānta and samṣyagājīva have been previously purified. " Thus the last three are considered as véññapti and as previous to absorption.
laukikamārgavairāgyaṃ pūrvakṛtamabhisaṃdhāyaitaduktam /	This text, the Vaibhāṣikas say, does not refer to the last three parts of the Way, but rather to speech, action, and livelihood in a state of detachment which have been obtained through the worldly path.
prātimokṣasaṃvaraścapi na syādasatyāmavijñaptau /	This does not prevent speech, etc. , from not forming part of the Way under the aspect of avijñapti.

deśānāvaraṇatvādapratighamiti /	It does not “cover,” it does not occupy a place: it is thus “free from destruction.
atha matam / kathamidānīṃ tat rūpam iti /	” If you ask how this object of absorption can be r%pa, you forget that the existence of gvġiñapti would give rise to the same question. The scripture says that there is a pure r%pa.

tatra punarāsravāṇāmapratipakṣatvātsāsravamuktam /	The Drstantikas answer that all the dharmas referred to in this scripture are qualified as impure because they are not opposed to the vices: in fact, only the mind and its mental states can oppose the vices and destroy them.

abhikṣṇaṃ tadālambanacetanābhyāsātsvapneṣvapi tā anuṣaṅginyo bhavanti /	”Even during dreams these volitions are linked together. On the contrary, we do not see how the partisans of an avirñapti can explain the growth of merit in the case of nonmaterial meritorious work. This does not consist of bodily or vocal action, but merely the joy experienced with regard to the Tathāgata or the Śrāvakas; it does not consist of an absorption.
avijñaptivādinastu niraupadhike yatra vijñaptirnāsti tatra kathāmavijñaptiḥ syāt /	Now according to the Vaibhāṣikas, the vijñapti can only give rise to the véjñapti or to an absorption. Hence it is impossible here.

yattarhi sūtra uktaṃ “yasyograbhikṣuḥ śīlavān kalyāṇadharmā piṇḍakaṃ paribhujyāpramāṇaṃ	But this opinion is inadmissible in light of the scripture which says, “When an energetic Bhikṣu, endowed with morality, possessor of good dharmas, eats the alms of a donor, he then enters into and dwells in the.

yata āyatyāṃ samante 'pi bahutaraphalābhinirvarttanasamarthā bhavatīti svayamapi	When an emissary charged with murder accomplishes the murder, it is in the nature of things that the mental series of the author of the instigation will submit to a certain subtle transformation by virtue of which his series will bear a result later. This holds likewise when one acts for oneself;
ca kurvataḥ kriyāphalaparisamāptāveṣa eva nyāyo veditavyaḥ /	when the course of action is achieved, at this moment the series.

It is by virtue of these same principles that the partisans of evijñapti consider the avjñapti as a bodily or vocal course of action.
upātteṣu skandheṣu trikālayā cetanayā prāṇātipātāvadhvena spṛśyata iti bhadantaḥ /	The Bhadanta proves in a different manner the nonexistence of gvrjñapti: “A person is touched by the sin of murder by reason of a tritemporal volition with regard to the skandhasr which constitute a living being, that is, when he thinks, ‘I shall kill;
haniṣyāmi hanmi hatamiti cāsya yadā bhavatīti / na tviyatā karmapathaḥ parisamāpyate / mā bhūdahate 'pi mātrādau hatābhimānināmānantaryaṃ karmeti /	I kill; he is killed.

The body of him who has accomplished the murder, is a hypothesis that cannot satisfy us;
yatkṛtaprayogasaṃbhūtā tu kriyāparisamāptistasyaiva tannimittaḥ saṃtatipariṇāmo bhavatīti bhavati paritoṣaḥ /	but to say that there is produced at the moment of the achievement of the course of action by an operation ordered by a certain person, a transformation of the mental series of this person, is a hypothesis that satisfies us.

yasyāḥ pratilambhādvyutthito 'pi na punarmithyāvāgādiṣu pravartate samyagvāgādiṣu ca pravartate /	In the Pat, the saint takes possession of certain pure avijñaptii, so that, when he leaves the contemplation, it is by the force of these pure gviñaptis that he produces correct speech, actions, and livelihood, and does not produce incorrect speech, actions, and livelihood. A cause takes the name of its result;

If this is so, why not accept my theory? There is no avijñapti;
samyagvāgādiṣu ca pravartate /	but the saint, when he finds himself in the Path, takes possession of a certain intention and of a certain personality so that, when he comes out of this contemplation, by reason of the force of these two factors he henceforth produces correct speech, actions and livelihood. One gives to the cause the name of their result;
ato nimitte naimittikopacāraṃ kṛtvā aṣṭau mārgāṅgāni vyavasthāpyanta iti /	and we can thus affirm that the Path possesses eight parts.
aparastvāha / tadakriyāmātramatrāṅgamuktaṃ syāt /	What is non-commission? The person who is in absorption acquires, through the force of the Path, definite absolute abstention.

nacātra cīvarādīnāmalābho nāmāsti dravyāntaram /	Non-possession of clothes, of food, etc. , is not a thing. If the aviñapti does not exist, say the Vaibhāṣikas, the Prṛātimokṣa discipline would disappear. One refutes this objection according to the same principles, by making a state out of the force of the intention. Discipline is volition which, after it has been translated into the positive action of abstaining from transgression, into the pledge of no longer committing.
prātimokṣasaṃvaro 'pi syāt yayā cetanayā vidhipūrvaṃ kṛtvā 'bhyupagamaḥ pratiṣiddhātkarmaṇaḥ kāyavācau saṃvṛṇoti /	Transgression, arrests bad actions and disciplines the body and the voice: the Prātimokṣa discipline should be understood in this manner.
anyacittona saṃvṛtaḥ syāditi cet /	‘The Vaibhāṣikas object that, if the Prātimokṣa discipline is volition, the monk who thinks a thought other than this thought of volition would cease being “disciplined,” for he does not then possess the volition which disciplines.

And this volition has the characteristic of a dike. When one is obliged not to commit transgression, one remembers this obligation, shame is present, and one constrains oneself in such a manner that one does not violate morality.
yadi punaravijñaptereva dauḥsīlyaṃ pratibadhnīyāt na kaścitmuṣitasmṛtiḥ śikṣāṃ bhindyāt /	In your system, on the contrary, if immorality is dammed up by an aviñapti independent of memory, then even a person who has a faulty memory would not be able to commit a transgression, since the. avijñapti is always there. Let us stop this discussion here.

yadyasti tacca mahābhūtānyupādāyetyuktam tat kim vijñaptimahābhūtānyevopādāyāvijñaptirutpadyate athānyāni /	We have seen that the avsjñapti arises dependent on the primary elements: the question is then posed whether it derives from the same primary elements which are the support of the v4iapti, that is, the primary elements of the body through which the action termed vġjñapti is accomplished;
anyānyeva sā mahābhūtānyupādāyotpadyate / na hi saiva sāmagrī sukṣmaphalā caudārikaphālā ca yujyate /	or if it deṟives from other primary elements. The avijñapti derives from primary elements different from those which serve as the support for the v²jñapti: for it is impossible that one and the same complex of four primary elements would produce both a subtle, derived pa,—the avġjñapti—, and at the same time a gross, derived rūpa, the vijñapti.
kiṃ khalu yadātanī vijñaptistadātanānyeva sā mahābhūtānyupādāya vartate /	The vijñapti is simultaneous to the primary elements from whence it derives; is such also the case for the avsjñapti?

tānyasyā āśrayārthena bhavanti / pratyutpannāni śarīramahābhūtāni saṃniśrayārthena /	These past primary elements constitute, from the second moment onward, the support of the vijnapti, for they are the cause of its pravritti, they are its projecting cause.

For there does not exist any pure primary elements from whence one could derive a pure action. For the pure bodily or vocal action arises by reason of the primary elements, and not only through.

Arisen from absorption, it derives from non-differentiated primary elements, not integral to the organism, and increase. Avjñapti which arises from samādhi, is divided into two types, that is, absorption, and pure discipline. These two both arise from sa/ādhi, are of increase, and not integral to the sense organism. They are both arisen from undifferentiated primary elements. In the same way that the mind which engenders these renouncings is a unity, the primary elements upon which the renouncings are based constitute a unity.

If on the contrary, bodily vsjñaptá does bot destroy the previous figure, two figares,—the first of retribution, the second of outflowing,—would be found to coexist in one and the same spot.
anyānyeva tāni naiḥṣyandikāni tadānīmupajāyante yānyupādāya vijñaptirbhavati /	We must admit that bodily viñapti arises deriving from new primary elements, outflowing in its nature, and that it does not destroy the previous figure.

There are no pure primary elements and yet there is a pure aviñapti. Pure avijñapti derives from the primary elements of the sphere wherein the person arises who produces the pure vijñaptin the same way, when a person arisen in Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu enters into an ārūpya absoṟption, he produces an avijñapti of Ārūpyadhātu deriving from the primary elements of Kāmadhātu or Rūpadhātu.

But this is inadmissible, for these primary elements belong to the class of undefiled-nentral dharmas, and everything that is to be abandoned through Seeing is defiled. We deny this consequence.

But this is not to say that the Blessed One is exempt from neutral dharmas: dharmas of retribution, dharmas related to attitudes, a mind capable of creating fictive beings.

The Vaibhāṣikas answer.
bhāvanā heyāntaritatvāt /	The v#ñapti is of the same nature as its agent when this latter is of a mind susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation. It is not of the same nature as its agent when this latter is of a mind susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing, for example, the thought “the soul exists,” for, in this case, another agent arises between the promoter and the action, a thought susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation, turned inward. Through vicāra and vitarka, one can preach the existence of a soul. The first agent is neutral, while the second is bad, and the action is bad. An agent susceptible to being abandoned through Seeing gives rise to an agent susceptible to being abandoned through Meditation, which can be good, bad, or neutral. From this second agent, an action of the same nature arises.

ato nāstīha nivṛtāvyākṛtā vijñaptiriti /	The Sūtra considers a wrong view as an agent, and by affirming that a wrong view generates vjñapti, it does not contradict the principle that the mind susceptible to being abandoned through Seeing does not engender vrñapti, nor its corollary that there is no vġjñapti of the defiled-neutral class in Kāmadhātu.
evaṃ vaktavyam / anyavyavahitaṃ hetusamutthānaṃ saṃdhāyoktamiti / avasitaḥ prasaṅgaḥ /	One must say that the Sūtra considers a wrong view as an agent.

He thought that persons in whom the senses are difficult to subdue would be well capable of undertaking the fast for a day and a night.

One does not undertake undiscipline by means of a ritual. One acquires undiscipline by acting with the intention of always acting badly; one does not acquire undiscipline by the intention of acting badly. In the case of the fast, the intention is not "for always;

“mṛṣāvādātigarhyatvāt saukaryādakriyāptitaḥ /“	For the same reasons: because lying is much censured in the world, because householders abstain from it easily, and because the Āryans are not capable of lying;
mṛṣāvādaprasaṅgācca sarvaśikṣāvyatikrame / sarvatra hi śikṣātikrame samanuyujyamānasyopasthitamidaṃ bhavati nāhamevamahārṣamiti	and also for a fourth reason: Because, having violated any other rule he would lie.

kāyaduścaritavacanāddurgatigamanācceti /	The Āryans, even in a following existence, do not drink strong liquor, not any more than they would commit the other transgressions of nature, killing, etc. Scripture—the Nandikasūra and elsewhere—places strong liquor among the misdeeds of the body. The Ābhidhārmikas answer: In general, the transgression of disobedience is permitted to the ill, as the answer to Upāli proves.

If the Āryans certainly abstain from strong liquor, it is not because it is a transgression by its very nature, but because they are filled with the force of modesty.
alpakasyāpyapānamaniyamādviṣavat /	This is because strong liquor makes mindfulness fail, even if they do not drink a drop, this is because the inebriating quantity is not determined, as for poison.
duścaritavacanaṃ pramādasthānatvāt /	Scripture considers strong liquor as a bodily misdeed, because strong liquor is a “cause of non-vigilence. ” In fact, the rule of training relative to strong liquor includes the expression, “Abandoning the pramādasthāna which is strong liquor, s#rā and maireya, 1 renounce pramādasthāṇa.
ata evātra pramādasthānagrahaṇaṃ nānyeṣu teṣāṃ prakṛtisāvadyatvāt /	” This is not the case for the other transgressions: one does not say “I renounce the pramādasthāna which is killing,” and that is because the other transgressions are transgressions by their very nature.

Preparatory and consecutive actions of the past and the future, with regard to which one cannot undertake any of the three disciplines.
natu saṃvarakāle vartamānāḥ karmapathāḥ santīti vartamānādhiṣṭhānebhyaḥ iti vaktavyam /	Objection: It is not correct to say that one undertakes the discipline relative to the course of action of the present time: for, when one undertakes the discipline, no bad course of action is present relative to which one could undertake the discipline.

The patanhya or the mau/i āpatti is in contradiction to the state required of being a Bhikṣu; he embraces an extreme absence of fear of transgression; he breaks off the root of discipline: all his discipline is lost.

kaścittu saṃtānaviśeṣānna pārājika ekacittenāpyapraticchādanāditi vyavasthāpitaṃ dharmasvāminā /	It is the idea of hiding the crime which is decisive here: if, thanks to the excellence of his moral dispositions, thanks to the excellence of his “series,” the guilty one does not have the thought of concealing his fault for en instant, then the King of the Law admits him as a penitant.
yadi tarhi pārājiko na bhikṣuḥ kiṃ punarna pravrājyate /	The Kaśmīreans: If a pārājñka is no longer a Bhikṣu, why is he not again admitted to ordination?

The discipline of dhyāna cuts off undiscipline, being a threefold change hostile to undisciplipe.

śubhamiti vartate /	Good action of the sphere of Kāmadhātu is called “meritorious” action, because it purifies, and because it produces an agreeable retribution.
rūpārūpyāvacaraṃ kuśalaṃ karmāneñjam /	“Good action above there,” that is to say, of the two higher spheres, is called “non-agitated.
nanu ca trīṇi dhyānāni señjitānyuktāni bhagavatā /	” But did not the Blessed One say that the first three Dhyānas are agitated? Did he not say that “the Āryans say that the vi$arkita and the vicaria of the First Dhyāna are agitation?
“yadatra vitarkitaṃ vicāritamidamatrāryā iñjitamityāhurityevamādi /	” The Blessed One said in fact that the first three Dhyānas are agitated, but he is saying this from the point of view of the corrupted characteristics of these dyānas;
samādau sāpakṣālatāṃ teṣāmadhikṛtyaivamuktam / āniñjānyapi tu tānyuktānyāniñjasūtre / āniñjasaṃpreyagāminīṃ pratipadamārabhya /	their vices are what agitate them. But in the Iīji²asūra, the Blessed One declared that these dhyānas are non-agitated because he considerd them a pathway favorable to non-agitation.
kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ señjitamevānyatrāniñjamuktam /	But why term that which is agitated non-agitated?
tadbhūmiṣu yataḥ karmavipākaṃ prati neñjati //	Action of the domain of the higher stages does not vary.
kāmāvacaraṃ hi vipākaṃ prati kampate / kathaṃ kampate / avyavasthānāt / anyagati kamapi hyanyasyāṃ gatau vipacyate /	Action of the sphere of Kāmadhātu is agitated in its retribution. The place of retribution is not fixed: one action which produces, naturally, a certain realm of rebirth, can be retributed in another one;
anyadevanaikāyikaṃ cānya devanikāye /	an action which produces a heavenly realm of rebirth can be rettibuted in another heavenly realm of rebirth.
yadeva hi pramāṇabalavarṇakarmānyabhūmika sukhabhogādi saṃvartanīyaṃ karma deveṣu vipacyate tadeva kadācidanyapratyayavaśānmanuṣyatiryakapreteṣu vipacyate /	In fact it happens that actions which produce power, a good figure, beauty, or objects of enjoyment, instead of being retributed in a heavenly realm of rebirth, are retributed in a human, animal, or Preta realm of rebirth through the efficacy of certain causes.
rūpārūpyāvacaraṃ tu karmānyabhūmikamanyasyāṃ bhūmau vipaktuṃ na jātūtsahate / tasmādvyavasthitavipākatvādāneñjamityucyate / apuṇyaṃ tu karmākuśalamiti prasiddhaṃ loke /	But no cause can make an action of the sphere of Rūpadhātu or Ārūpyadhātu be retributed in any but the sphere which is proper to it. Bad action is demeritorious.
yaśca lokato 'rthaḥ prasiddhaḥ kiṃ tatra yatnena / kṛtaḥ puṇyādīnāṃ karmaṇāṃ nirdeśaḥ /	This is well known in the world and there is no good reason to insist on what is well known in the world.
sukhavedanīyādīnāṃ kartavyaḥ / sa eṣa kriyate / sukhavedyaṃ śubhaṃ dhyānādātṛtīyāt	As for actions of agreeable feeling, etc. :Good action, up to the Third Dhyāna, is of agreeable feeling. Agreeable sensation does not exist above the Third Dhyāṇas: it thus has Kāmadhātu and the first three Dhyānas for its domain.
kuśalaṃ karma sukhavedanīyaṃ yāvat tṛtīyāddhyānāt / eṣā hi bhūmiḥ sukhāyā vedanāyā yaduta kāmadhātustrīṇi ca dhyānāni / ataḥ param aduḥkhāsukhavedyaṃ tu	Hence the retribution of good action is of agreeable feeling up to the Third Dhyāna.
śubhamiti vartate /	Action having such a retribution is called “of agreeable sensation”.
tṛtīyadhyānāt pareṇa kuśalaṃ karmāduḥkhāsukhavedanīyaṃ sukhaduḥkhavedanā 'bhāvāt /	Above, it is of neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensation. Agreeable and disagreeable sensation do not exist above the Third Dhyāṇṉa. There only remains the sensation of indifference, which is the only retribution of good action retributed above the Third Dhyāṇna.
duḥkhavedyamihāśubham //	Bad action, here below, is of disagreeable sensation.
akuśalaṃ karma duḥkhavedanīyam /	Bad action is of disagreeable sensation.
ihagrahaṇaṃ kāmadhātāveva tadbhāvajñāpanārtham /	The ārkā says 'here below” in order to indicate that this action exists only in Kāmadhāta.
na caiṣāṃ vedanaiva phalam / kiṃ tarhi / sasaṃbhārā /	Is the result of all these actions only sensation? they also have the apparatus of sensation as their result.
adho 'pi madhyamastyeke /	According to some, intermediary action also exists.
anye punarāhuḥ tadetanmadhyamaduḥkhāsukhavedanīyaṃ karmoktametaccaturthadhyānādadho 'pyasti / kiṃ kāraṇam / dhyānāntaravipākataḥ /	According to others, intermediary action—that is, action which has for its retribution neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensation—also exists below the Fourth Dhyāna.
itarathā hi dhyānāntarakarmaṇo vipāko na syāddhyānāntaraṃ vā kasyacitkarmaṇaḥ / tatra sukhaduḥkhayorabhāvāt /	Since there is no retribution with regard to dhyānāntara, if intermediary action is absent below the Fourth Dhyāṇna, there would not be any retribution of dhyāanāntara action, or rather, there would not be any retribution of any action whatsoever in dhyānāntara, for there are no agreeable and disagreeable sensations therein.
dhyānāntarakarmaṇo dhyāna eva sukhendrīyaṃ vipāka ityeke /	Some say that the retribution of dḍhyānāntara action is the sensation of pleasure of the dhyāna itself;
naiva tasya vedanā vipāka ityapare / tadetaducchāstram /	some others say that the retribution of this action is not sensation.
śāstre hi paṭhitaṃ “syātkarmaṇaścaitasikyeva vedanā vipāko vipacyeta /	These two opinions are in contradiction to the Śāstra, “Does it happen that an action is solely mental sensation?
syātkuśalasyāvitarkasya karmaṇa” iti / apurvācaramaḥ pākastrayāṇāṃ ceṣyate yataḥ //	Yes, the retribution of a good action which was free from vsitarka. ”Because it is admitted that the retribution of the three types of action takes place at the one and same time. This is the second reason why one should admit that intermediary action exists below the Fourth Dhyāṇa.
yataścoktaṃ sūtre “syāttrayāṇāṃ karmaṇāmapūrvācaramo vipāko vipacyeta /	The Śāstra says in the same place, “Does it happen that there is at oṉe and the same time retribution of the three types of action? Yes.
syātsukhavedanīyasya rūpaṃ duḥkhavedanīyasya cittacaittā dharmāḥ /	There can take place at the same time: the retribution of an action of agreeable sensation, namely of materialdharmas, [the organ of seeing, etc. ]; the retribution of an action of disagreeable sensation, namely the mind and the mental states ;
aduḥkhāsukhavedanīyasya cittaviprayuktā” ityato 'pyastyaduḥkhāsukhavedanīyaṃ karmādhastāt /	the retribution of an action of neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensation, namely thedbarmas dissociated from the rnind, [vital organ, etc. , iii35].
nahi kāmadhātoranyatrāsti yugapatkarmatrayasya vipāke saṃyogaḥ / kimidānīṃ tatkukśalamāhosvidakuśalaṃ /	” Now, the three types of action cannot be retributed simultaneously outside of Kāmadhātu, for the retribution of action of disagreeable sensation takes place only in Kāmadhātu.
durbalaṃ tu tat / evaṃ tarhi “sukhavedyaṃ śubhaṃ dhyānādātṛtīyā” “diṣṭa-vipākaṃ ca kuśala” mityasya virodhaḥ / bāhulika eṣa nirdeśo draṣṭavyaḥ /	It is good, but of weak force.
kathaṃ punaravedanāsvabhāvaṃ karma sukhādivedinīyamityucyate /	But how can one say that action is of agreeable sensation? Action, by its nature, is not sensation.
sukhavedanāyai hitaṃ sukhavedanoyaṃ sukho 'sya vedanīya iti vā / kaśca vedanīyaḥ / yo vipākaḥ /	One expresses oneself in this way because action is favorable to agreeable sensation;
sa hyasau vidyate sukhasya vā vedanīyaṃ yena sukhaṃ vedayate /	or rather, because its retribution is agreeably sensed.
snānīyakapāyavat / evaṃ duḥkhavedanīyamaduḥkhāsukhavedanīyaṃ ca draṣṭavyam /	In the same way that one calls bathing clothes, snānāyakāṣāya, “the clothes with which one bathes,” in that same way one terms “to be sensed” action through which one senses a retribution.
api ca / svabhāvasaṃprayogābhyāmālambanavipākataḥ / saṃmukhībhāvataśceti pañcadhā vedanīyatā //	There are five ways of being vedanīya, “sensed,” “experienced:” of itself, through sensation, as an object, by being retributed, and by the fact of its presence.
svabhāvavedanīyatā vedanānām /	Sensation, by its nature, is feeling.
svabhāvenaiva vedanīyatvāt / saṃprayogavedanīyatā sparśasya / “sukhavedanīyaḥ sparśaḥ” iti / ālambanavedanīyatā viṣayāṇām /	Agreeable sensation is agreeable experience, etc. Contact is feeling because it is associated with sensation.
yathoktaṃ “cakṣuṣā rūpāṇi dṛṣṭvā rūpapratisaṃvedī bhavati notu rūparāgapratisaṃvedī“tyevamādi /	The six objects of the six organs are feeling in the role of object, "Seeing color with the eye, he experiences, he feels the color, but he does not feel the color with affection.
vedanayā hi tāmālambamānaḥ pratisaṃvedayate / vipākavedanīyatā karmaṇaḥ /	" Color is thus the object of sensation.
“dṛṣṭadharmavedanīyaṃ karme“ti vistaraḥ /	Action is feeling in its role of being retributed, "an action experienced in the present existence".
saṃmukhībhāvavedanīyatā /	Sensation is feeling through the fact of its appearance.
yathoktaṃ “yasmin samaye sukhāṃ vedanāṃ vedayate dve asya vedane tasminsamaye niruddhe bhavata” iti / nahi yasminsamaye sukhā vedanā vartate tasminpunaranyā vedanā 'sti sa yāṃ tāṃ vedayate /	"When he feels, when he experiences agreeable sensation, two sensations, the disagreeable and the neutral, are then found to be obstructed by it:" hence when agreeable sensation is functioning, there is no other sensation through which one would feel it.
saṃmukhīkurvastu tāṃ vedayata ityucyate / ato vipākasya vedanīyatvāt karmāpyucyate sukhavedanīyamityevamādi /	Thus if one says that this sensation is "to be felt", this is because it is present.
niyatāniyataṃ tacca	This action is determinate or indeterminate.
taccaitatsukhavedanīyādi trividhaṃ karma niyataṃ cāniyataṃ ca veditavyam /	The action that we have just described is either determinate, that is, "which will necessarily be felt," orDeterminate action is of three types, to be experienced in the present life, etc. Determinate action is: to be experienced in the present life;
nāvaśyavedanīyamaniyatam / niyataṃ trividhaṃ punaḥ /	to be experienced after having been reborn, in other words in the next immediate life;
dṛṣṭadharmādivedyatvāt	and to be experienced later.
dṛṣṭadharmavedanīyamupapadyavedanīyamaparaparyāyavedanīyaṃ cetyetattrividhaṃ karma niyatamityetaccaturvidhaṃ karma bhavati sahāniyatavedanīyena	By adding indeterminate action, this makes, from the point of view of the modality of retribution, four types.

aniyatavedanīyaṃ dvidhā kṛtvā / vipākena niyatamaniyataṃ ceti /	By dividing indeterminate action into two categories: that which is indeterminate with regard to the period of its retribution, but whose retribution is in any case certain; and that which is indeterminate with regard to its retribution, which can be not retributed.
tatra dṛṣṭadharmavedanīyaṃ yatra janmani kṛtaṃ tatraiva vipacyate /	Action experienced in the present life is action which ripens or is retributed in the same existence in which it was accomplished. Action experienced after being reborn is action which is retributed in the existence which follows that in which it was accomplished. Action.
upapadyavedanīyaṃ dvitīye janmani /	Experienced later is action which is retributed in a later existence, from the third existence on. But, some other masters, cannot admit that a very strong action has a weak retribution.
aparaparyāyavedanīyaṃ tasmātpareṇa / janmāntare 'pyasti dṛṣṭadharmavedanīyasya karmaṇo vipāka ārambhavaśāttannāmavyavasthānamityapare /	Consequently, the retribution of an action experienced in the present life can continue into other existences;

asti karmāvasthāniyataṃ na vipāke niyatam /	Action determined with regard to the period of its retribution, but indeterminate with regard to its retribution. If this action is retributed, it will certainly be retributed at such a moment, but it is not necessarily retributed: this is.

asti vipāke niyataṃ nāvasthāyām /	This action will be retributed, but the period of its retribution remains undetermined: néyabavipāka, but ansyatavedanīya. Action determinate from two points of view: náyatavipāka and niyatavedanāyaá. Action indeterminate from two points of view: aniyatavipāka and aniyatavedanṅīya. According to this system there are eight types of actions: 1.

astyubhayaniyataṃ yadṛṣṭadharmādivedanīyaṃ vipāke niyatam /	action experienced in the present existence and of possible retribution.

nirvipratisāraṃ ca tat karma bhavati niṣpratipakṣaṃ ca / kathaṃ parivārataḥ /	but when this measure is completed, it is accumulated, "By reason of the absence of regret and opposition" When remorse is absent, or when opposition,--confession, etc,—is absent, action is then termed "accumulated.
akuśalaṃ cākuśalaparivāraṃ ca bhavati / kathaṃ vipākataḥ / vipākadāna niyataṃ bhavati /	" "By reason of its accompaniments:" When an action is bad and has a bad escort: it is "By reason of its retribution:" Action is accumulated which necessarily gives forth retribution.
evaṃ kuśalamapi yojyam /	The same for good action.
ato 'nyathā karma kṛtaṃ bhavati nopacitam /	Action which does not present these characteristics is done, but is not accumulated.
caitye sarāgasyātmārthaṃ dānamityuktam /	We have seen that a gift made to a Caitya by a person not detached from desire is a gift of benefit for him who made it.
tatrāsatyupabhoktari kathaṃ puṇyaṃ bhavati /	But no one enjoys the thing given: how can this gift be meritorious?
dvividhaṃ hi puṇyaṃ tyāgānvayaṃ tyāgādeva yadupapadyate paribhogānvayaṃ ca deyadharmaparibhogādyadutpadyate /	The merits of the gift are of two types: 1. merit produced by abandoning, that is, the merit which results from the sole fact of. the merit produced by enjoying an object is the merit that results in joy for the person who receives it.
caitye tyāgānvayaṃ puṇyaṃ	The merit of a gift to a Caitya is produced by abandoning.
paribhogānvyaṃ puṇyaṃ nāsti / kathaṃ tatrāpratigṛhṇati kasmiṃścit puṇyam /	How can a gift produce merit when no one receives it?
kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ sati pratigrahītari bhavitavyaṃ nāsatīti /	We would answer this objection by asking why the gift would produce merit when someone receives it, and why it would not produce merit when no one receives it.
kasyacidapyanugrahābhāvāt / idamakāraṇam /	Because, in the second case, no one is satisfied or favored by the gift.
yadi hi puṇyaṃ parānugrahādeva syāt maitryādyapramāṇasamyagdṛṣṭibhāvanāyāṃ na syāt / tasmādeṣṭavyaṃ caityai 'pi puṇyam / maitryādivadagṛhṇati /	If the satisfaction of a person who receives is a condition for merit, then you deny that the Immeasurable Meditations and the Meditation of Right View are meritorious.
yathā maitryādiṣvantareṇāpi pratigrāhakaṃ parānugrahaṃ vā puṇyaṃ bhavati svacittaprabhavaṃ tathābhyatīte 'pi guṇavati tadbhaktikṛtaṃ svacittāt puṇyaṃ bhavati /	The gift to a Caitya thus produces merit, even though no one receives it, as is the case with compassion, etc. In the case of the Meditation on Compassion, no one receives, no one is satisfied, and yet merit arises for the compassionate person, through the very force of his thoughts of compassion. In the same way. Even though the Excellent Being has passed away, a gift to a Caitya made with devotion to him is meritorious by reason of the thought of the believer himself.
dānamānakriyā tarhi vyarthā prāpnoti /  na /	Should we conclude then that material offerings and worship are superfluous?
tatkarmasamutthāpikāyā bhakteḥ prakṛṣṭataratvāt /	No, for the devotion which produces these actions very much outweighs the devotion of a person who worships and who gives in mind only.
yathā hi śatruvadhābhiprāyasya tatsamutthāpitaṃ kāyavākkarma / śatrusaṃjñayā tasminmṛte 'pi kurvato bahutaramapuṇyaṃ jāyate / nābhiprāyamātreṇa /	When a person who has the intention of killing his enemy, contintes his bodily and vocal actions on the dead body of his enemy which this intention provokes, thinking, "This is my enemy," that is to say, he thinks, "This enemy is not yet dead," he obtains dermerit very much greater than he would have through merely the intention.
tathābhyatīte śāstari tadbhaktisamutthāṃ dānamānakriyāṃ kurvato bahutaraṃ puṇyaṃ jāyate / na bhaktimātreṇa /	In the same way, even though the Master has passed away, the person who does actions of giving and worship inspired through devotion obtains a much greater merit than he would have only through devotion.
yadi svakṣetre dānakriyāvījamiṣṭaphalaṃ bhavati tatkṣetre tarhyaniṣṭaphalaṃ bhaviṣyati /	If a seed given to a good field bears an agreeable result, should we think that it bears a disagreeable result if given to a bad field?
kukṣetre 'pīṣṭaphalatā phalabījāviparyayāt //	Even seeded into a bad field, the gift bears agreeable results, for there is never opposition between the result and the seed.
kukṣetre 'pi phalasya bījādaviparyayo dṛṣṭo mṛdvīkābījānmṛdvīkāphalamevotpadyate madhuraṃ nimbavījānnimbameva tiktam /	From the seed of the vine, there arises solely the sweet fruit of the vine; from the seed of the vômba there arises only the sour fruit of the vôwba: even seeded into a bad field, the seed bears the result which is appropriate to it.
evaṃ kukṣetre 'pi parahitādhyāśayapravṛttasya dānabījasyeṣṭameva phalaṃ nirvartate nāniṣṭam /	In the same way, this seed which is the gift of a person who has the intention of being useful to another, even if placed into a bad field, can only produce an agreeable result.
kṣetradoṣāttu tadvījamalpaphalaṃ vā bhavatyaphalaṃ vā /	Bat, through the evil of the field, the result will be small or almost nil.
gataṃ dānamayapuṇyakriyāvastu saprasaṅgam //	We have explained meritorious work which consists of Giving, together with its related questions.
śīlamayaṃ vaktavyam / taducyate	We must now explain meritorious work which consists of the Precepts.
dauḥśītlamaśubhaṃ rūpaṃ śīlaṃ tadviratiḥ	Immorality is bad r%pa. Morality is the renouncing of immorality.
akuśalaṃ hi rūpaṃ dauḥśīlyamucyate /	Bad rūpa is called immorality.
tasmādviratiḥ śīlam / sā punarviratiḥ dvidhā /	The renouncing of immorality, which is morality, is Ōf two types.
yayā ca viramyate vijñaptyā yacca tadviramaṇam avijñaptiḥ /	Renouncing is vijñapti, the action by which one renounces.
na ca kevalaṃ dauḥśīlyādviratiḥ śīlam / kiṃ tarhi /	Morality is not solely the renouncing of immorality.
pratikṣiptācca buddhena	It is farther, the renouncing of that which is prohibited by the Buddha.
yadapi na prakṛtyā dauḥśīlayaṃ bhagavatā ca buddhena pratikṣiptamakālabhojanādikaṃ tasmādapi dvidhā viratiḥ śīlam /	To renounce that which is prohibited by the Buddha, the Blessed One—without being in and of itself immoral, for example renouncing meals at forbidden times—is also morality. This renouncing is also vijñapti and aviñapti.
samāttaśikṣasya tu tadadhyācārāddauḥśīlyaṃ jāyate //	He who has undertaken to observe the rules and who then violates them, commits immorality.
uktaṃ tamāsena śīlam // viśuddhaṃ tu caturguṇam //	The morality that we have just described, in short, is Pure, when it is endowed with the four qualities.
tattu śīlaṃ caturguṇaṃ bhavati /	Morality endowed with the four qualities is pure;
viparyayādaviśuddham / atha kathaṃ caturguṇamityāha	it is impure in the contrary case. Not troubled by immorality, by the causes of immorality;
dauḥśīlyataddhetvahataṃ tadvipakṣaśamāśritam / dauḥśītyena tāvadanupahataṃ bhavati yathoktena dauḥśīlyena / hetunā 'pyanupahataṃ bhavati /	it takes as its support the opposite of immorality and “Not troubled by immorality” we have described;

pariśuddhaṃ śīlamanāsravaśīlaṃ nirmalatvāditi //	According to another opinion, morality is of four types: the morality of fear, mercenary morality, a morality suitable to the parts of Bodhi, and pure morality.
gataṃ śīlam //	We have explained morality.
samāhitaṃ tu kuśalaṃ bhāvanā	"Good absorption" or good in absorption, is bhāvanā, meditation, soaking in, or impregnation.
kimidaṃ samāhitaṃ nāma /	What do we understand by samāhita, absorbed?
samādhisvabhāvaṃ sahabhū yat /	That which is absorption by its nature, and that which coexists with what is absorption by nature.
kimarthametat bhāvanetyucyate /	Why does "good absorption" receive the name of bhāvanā?
cittavāsanāt //	Because it perfumes, impregnates the mind.
taddhi samāhitaṃ kuśalamatyarthaṃ cittaṃ vāsayati / guṇaistanmayīkaraṇātsaṃtateḥ / puṣpaistilabhāvanāvat /	Good absorption impregnates the mind to an extreme degree, because it grasps the qualities of this good, in the same way as sesame seeds are impregnated by flowers in their grasping the odor of these flowers.
dānaṃ tāvanmahābhogatāyai saṃvartata ityuktam /	We have said that the result of giving consists of joys.
atha śīlaṃ bhāvanā ca	What result does one obtain from the precepts and from meditation?
svargāya śīlaṃ prādhānyāt visaṃyogāya bhāvanā /	Essentially, the precepts have heaven for their result;
dānamapi svargāya śīlaṃ prādhānyāt / śīlamapi visaṃyogāya /	meditation has disconnection for its result, Giving also has heaven for its result, but the precepts are the principle, normative cause of it. Disconnection, or Nirvāṇa. has meditation for its cause, which, in the path of abandoning immediately produces disconnection from the defilements;
bhāvanā tu prādhānyāt /	but the precepts contribute to it, since stilling and insight presuppose the precepts.
sutra uktaṃ “catvāraḥ pudgalā brāhmaṇyaṃ puṇyaṃ prasavantī“ti /	The Sūtra says that four persons produce “Brahmin” merit, brāhmapnṇya.
katamat tad brāhmapuṇyam /	What is this merit?
yattallakṣaṇavipākasya karmaṇaḥ parimāṇajñāpanāyoktam iti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	According to the Vaibhāṣikas, this is the merit which has been defined above in order that we might know the measure of the action which has the marks of the Bodhisattva for its result.
pūrvācāryās tu vyācakṣate / caturṇāṃ brāhmapuṇyatvaṃ kalpaṃ svargeṣu modanāt //	The ancient masters said: Four possess Brahmin merit, because they are happy in the heavens for a kalpa.
yāvatā puṇyena kalpaṃ svargeṣu modate idaṃ brāhmaṃ puṇyam / brahmapurohitānāṃ kalpāyuṣkatvāt /	The merit of such a measure that one is happy in heaven for a kalpa is the Brahmin merit, for the lifespan of the Brahmapurohitas is a kalpa.
nikāyāntare gāthāṃ paṭhanti “brāhmaṃ puṇyaṃ prasavati kalpaṃ svargeṣu modata” iti /	And in another Canon, one reads, “He engenders Brahmin merit, he is happy in the heavens for a kalpa.”
āmiṣadānamuktam / dharmadānaṃ vaktavyam / tadidamucyate /	We have studied material giving.
dharmadānaṃ yathābhūta sūtrādyakliṣṭadeśanā / sūtrādīnāṃ yathābhūtamakliṣṭadeśanā dharmadānam /	The gift of the Dharmas is the correct teaching, not defiled, of the Sūtras etc. The gift of the Dharma is to teach, correctly and with a mind not defiled, the Śūtra and the other parts of Scripture.
ato mahatīṃ ta ātmanaḥ puṇyajyāniṃ kurvanti ye viparītadharmaṃ deśayanti / kliṣṭacittā vā lābhasatkāra yaśāṃsi vāñchantaḥ /	Consequently, those who teach the Dharma either falsely, or with a defiled mind, through a desire or gain, for respect, and for reputation, destroy the great merit which would otherwise fall to them.
uktaṃ puṇyakriyāvastubhedena trividhaṃ kuśalaṃ punaḥ	We have explained the three types of good according to the distinction of the three items of meritorious work.
puṇyanirvāṇanirvedhabhāgīyaṃ kuśalaṃ tridhā //	Furthermore, Good is threefold, merit, Nirvāṇa and penetratiorn Good merit, or good “favorable to merit” is the good which leads to an agreeable retribution.
puṇyabhāgīyaṃ yadiṣṭavipākaṃ mokṣabhāgīyaṃ yasminnutpanne niyataṃ parinirvāṇadharmā bhavati / yasya saṃsārādīnavanairātmyanirvāṇaguṇadyotikāṃ kathāṃ śrutvā romaharṣāśrūpātau bhavatastasyāsti	The good which is deliverance is the good which, when it arises, becomes a dharma of Parinirvāṇa.
mokṣabhāgīyaṃ kuśalamūlamityavaseyaṃ pravṛṣīvāṅkuraprarohāt khalavileṣu bījāstitvam /	It is recognized that whoever, understanding the sermons concerning the defects of Saṁsāra, the non-self, and the qunalities of Nirvāṇa, has his hairs stand on end and who pours forth tears, possesses the mokṣgabhāgīya rtoot of good; in this same way, one knows that there was a seed in the khalabila. when, in the rain, one sees a plant put forth shoots.
nirvedhabhāgīyamuṣmādi caturvidhaṃ paścādvyākhyāsyāmaḥ /	The good of penetration is fourfold, urmagatas, etc. ; it will be explained later.
yadidaṃ loka ucyate lipimudrāgaṇanā kāvyaṃ saṃkhyeti ka eṣāṃ svabhāvaḥ /	What is the nature of what is popularly called writing, carving, eloquence, poetry, and calculation?
yogapravartitaṃ karma sasamutthāpakaṃ tridhā / lipimudre sagaṇanaṃ kāvyaṃ saṃkhyā yathākramam //	An industrious action, of the body, of the voice or of the mind, with that which gives rise to it, are such things as writing, carving, eloquence, poetry, and calculation.
yogapravartitamiti upāyaviśeṣapravartitam /	“Iṇḍustrious,” that is, due to a certain technique.
tridhā karmeti kāyavāṅmanaskarma /	“Threefold action” is bodily, vocal, and mental action.
tatra lipimudre tāvadyogapravartitaṃ kāyakarma samutthāpanam /	“Writing and carving” are bodily actions, industrious, together with what gives rise to this action, namely the collection of the mind and its mental states.
gaṇanā kāvyaṃ ca vākkarma / ityetāni pañcaskandhasvabhāvāni /	“Eloquence and poetry” are vocal actions, Consequently, writing, carving, eloquence, and poetry, are by their nature, the five sēanṇdbas.
saṃkhyā manaskarma /	“Calculation” is mental action;
yanmanasā saṃkalanaṃ dharmāṇām /	this refers to the mental enumeration of the dharmas.
dharmāṇāmidānīṃ kecit paryāyā ucyante /	Now let us explain some synonyms: Defiled dharmas are sāvadya, nivr̥ta, and hṇa. Some synonyms of "defiled" are: távadya, associated with vadya, or bad;
sāvadyā nivṛtā hīnāḥ kliṣṭā dharmāḥ	nôvrta, that is, "covered" by the defilements;
kliṣṭānāṃ dharmāṇāṃ sāvadyā nivṛtā hīnā iti paryāyāḥ /	and the defilements themselves are covered by other defilements; hṉa, or ignoble, because they are low or abandoned by the Āryans. Good and pure dharmas are praṇīta.
śubhāmalāḥ / praṇītāḥ kuśalānāsravāṇāṃ praṇītā iti paryāyaḥ /	Praṇīta, "excellent," is a synonym for śubha, that is, kuśala, good, and of amala, immaculate or anāsrava.
hīnapraṇītebhyo 'nye madhyā iti siddhaṃ bhavati /	The dharmas which are neither ignoble nor excellent are thus median.
saṃskṛtaśubhāḥ sevyāḥ	Good conditioned dharmas are sevya.
kusalasaṃskṛtānāṃ sevitavyā iti paryāyaḥ /	Sevya, "to be cultivated," is synonymous with "good" and "conditioned.
śeṣā asevitavyā iti siddhaṃ bhavati /	" It then follows that other dharmas, some unconditioned, others conditioned but defiled or non-defiled-neutral, are not to be cultivated.
kasmādasaṃskṛtaṃ na sevyam / anabhyasanīyatvādaphalatvācca / phalarthaṃ hi sevā bhavati /	In fact, unconditioned dharmas are not susceptible to being produced or cultivated, since the unconditioned has no result: now, it is with a view to a result that one cultivates.
sottarā anye sarvadharmāḥ /	All the other dharmas are inferior.
mokṣastvanuttaraḥ //	Deliverance is the highest.
nahi nirvāṇādviśiṣṭataramasti / tacca sarvebhyo viśiṣṭaṃ kuśalanityatvāt / abhidharmakośabhāṣye karmanirddeśo nāma caturthaṃ kośasthānamiti // pañcamaṃ kośasthānam oṃ namo buddhāya	There is nothing which outweighs Nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa, being eternal.
“karmajaṃ lokavaicitrya” mityuktam /	We said that the world, in all its variety, arises from action.
tāni karmāṇyanuśayavaśādupacayaṃ gacchanti antareṇa cānuśayān bhavābhinirvarttane na samarthāni bhavanti /	Now it is by reason of the latent defilements, or latent defilements, that actions accumulate: in the absence of the actions, actions are not capable of producing a new existence.
ato veditavyāḥ	Consequently.
mūlaṃ bhavasyānuśayāḥ kleśo hi pravartamāno daśa kṛtyāni karoti /	When a defilement enters into action, it accomplishes ten operations: it makes solid its root, its possession, preventing it from being broken; it places itself in a series;
mūlaṃ ca dṛḍhīkaroti saṃtatimavasthāpayati kṣetramāpādayati niḥṣyandaṃ nirvartayati	it accommodates its field, rendering the person fit for the arising of the defilement; it engenders its offspring, that is, the defilements;
karmabhavamabhinirharati svasaṃbhāraṃ arigṛhṇāti ālambane saṃmohayati vijñānasroto namayati kuśalapakṣādvyutkrāmati pandhanārthaṃ ca spharati dhātvanatikramayogeneti /	it leads to action; it aggregates its causes, namely, incorrect judgment; it causes one to be mistaken with regard to the object of.
kati ceme 'nuśayāḥ /	How many znzuśayas are there?
samāsena ṣaṭ /	There are, in all, six.
katame	What are they?
ṣaḍrāgaḥ pratighastathā / māno 'vidyā ca dṛṣṭiśca vicikitsā ca	Six: attachment, and then anger, pride, ignorance, false views, and doubt.
athāgrahaṇaṃ rāgavaśenānyeṣāmālambanānuśāyitajñāpanārtham /	The words “and then” serve to show that it is by reason of attachment that the others “take up their abode” in the object.
etacca paścāt pravedayiṣyāmaḥ / te punaḥ // ṣaḍrāgabhedātsaptoktāḥ	We shall explain this point later.
ta ete ṣaḍnuśayāḥ sūtre rāgasya dvidhā bhedaṃ kṛtvā saptoktāḥ /	These six make sevenṉ through the division of attachment. There is the anuśaya of attachment to pleasure or sensual desire; the anuśaya of anger; the anuśaya of attachment to existence; the aṉaśaya of pride;
kāmarāgānuśayaḥ pratighānuśayo bhavarāgānuśayo mānānuśyaḥ avidyānuśayo dṛṣṭyanuśayo vicikitsānuśaya iti /	the anṉuśaya of ignorance; the aṉnuśaya of erroneous views; and the enṉuśaya of doubt.
kathamidaṃ jñātavyaṃ kāmarāga evānuśayaḥ kāmarāgānuśayaḥ āhosvit kāmarāgasyānuśayaḥ kāmarāganuśayaḥ /	What does the expression kāmarāgānuśaya signify? Is there an anuśaya called kāmarāga?
kiṃ cātaḥ /	Or is there an anuśfaya of kāmarāga distinct from kāmarāga?
kāmarāga evānuśayaścet sūtravirodhaḥ / “ihaikatyo na kāmarāgaparyavasthitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharati /	If one says that kāmarāga is an anuśaya, one then contradicts the Sūtra which says, “The person who does not long dwell with his mind in the prey of attachment to pleasure;
utpannasya kāmarāgaparyavasthānasyottari niḥsaraṇaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti / tasya tatkāmarāgaparyavasthānaṃ sthāmaśaḥ samyaktvasamavahataṃ sānuśayaṃ prahīyata“iti /	who, when the wrapping of attachment is about to be produced, knows well how to depart from it, for this person the wrapping which is attachment, perfectly destroyed of its life force, is abandoned along with its anzśaya. To say that attachment is abandoned at the same time as its aenwśaya is to say that attachment and its en#śaya are two distinct things. If one explains kéāmarāgānuśya as the anuśfaya of kāmarāga, one must make the genuś%ya a thing not associated with the mind.
kāmarāgasyānuśayaścedviprayuktānuśayaprasaṅgādabhidharmavirodhaḥ “kāmarāgānuśayastribhirindriyaiḥ saṃprayukta” iti / kāmarāga evānuśya iti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	But such a theory is in contradiction to the Abhidharma which teaches that “kāmarāgġānuśaya is associated with three sensations, that of pleasure, satisfaction, and indifference.” Now a ḍharma not associated with the mind cannot be accompanied by these sensations.
evaṃ yāvadvicikitsaivānuśaya iti /	The same for the other defilements: doubt is the anuśaya of doubt.
nanu coktamevaṃ sūtravirodha iti /	But the Sūtra which we have just quoted says that one abandons éáṁmarāga along with its anuśaya.
nāsti virodhaḥ /	Hence the anuśaya is not kāmarāga.
sānuśayaṃ sānubandhamityarthaḥ /	The Vaibhāṣikas answer: The expression “with its aenuśaya’” should be explained as ““with its anubandha”’ , that is, ““with its consequences.
aupacāriko vā sūtre 'nuśayaśabdaḥ prāptau / yathā duḥkho 'gniriti /	Or rather the Sutra uses the word anuśaya in the sense of 'possession’’ because possession is the cause of the anuśaya.
lākṣaṇikastvabhidharme kleśa evānuśayaśabdaḥ /	But the Abhidharma, which always expresses itself literally and not figuratively, says that the anezśaya is the kJefa or defilement itself.
tasmātsaṃyuktā evānuśayāḥ / kathamidaṃ gamyate / anuśayānāṃ	Consequently the @n2xayas are associated with the mind.
“cittakleśakaratvādāvaraṇatvācchubhairviruddhatvāt” /	(Besides this argument from authority, there is an argument from inference:) “Because they defile the mind, because they hinder, because they are in contradiction with good, and yet because good appears, the anufayas are not disassociated from the mind.”
yasmādanuśayaiḥ kliṣṭaṃ cittaṃ bhavatyapūrvaṃ kuśalaṃ notpadyate utpannācca parihīyate tasmānna viprayuktāḥ /	This means that because of the aenuśayas, the mind is defiled; good which has not arisen is hindered from arising, and one falls. away from good already arisen; consequently the enufayas are not dharmas disassociated from the mind. But, one would say, some dharmas disassociated from the mind cat.
atha viprayuktairapyevaṃ syāt / kuśalaṃ na kadācidupalabhyeta /	have a similar effect.
teṣāṃ nityaṃ saṃnihitatvāt /	No, for if the anufayas were disassociated from the mind, they would always be present; and, consequently, if we suppose that they have a similar effect, then good would never be able to arise.
upalabhyate ca /	Now it is a fact that it does arise.
ataḥ “kuśalasya copalambhādaviprayuktāḥ atha ihānuśayāḥ” iti / tadidamajñāpakaṃ yasmādyo viprayuktamanuśayamicchati sa etatsarvamanuśayakṛtaṃ necchati /	Thus the anuśayas are not disassociated from the mind.
kleśakṛtamevecchati /	But again, the masters who consider the zvuś4yas as disassociated from the mind do not attribute this threefold activity to the aṉxśayas, but to the kleśa itself (that is, to the paryavasthāna, the active defilement; and this is not always present).
evaṃ tu sādhu yathā sautrāntikānām / kathaṃ ca sautrāntikānām /	The Sautrāntika theory is best.
kāmarāgasyānuśayaḥ kāmarāgānuśaya iti /	Kāmarāgānuśfaya means “anuśaya of kāmarāga’'.
na cānuśayaḥ saṃprayukto na viprayuktastasyādravyāntaratvāt /	But the anuśaya is neither associated with the mind, nor disassociated from it: foṟ it is not a separate thing.
prasupto hi kleśo 'nuśaya ucyate /	What is called aenuśaya is the kleśa itself in a state of sleep, whereas the paryavasthāna is the.
prabuddhaḥ paryavasthānam / kā ca tasya prasuptiḥ /	klefa in an awakened state.
asaṃmukhībhūtasya bījabhāvānubandhaḥ / kaḥ prabodhaḥ / saṃmukhībhāvaḥ / ko 'yaṃ vījabhāvo nāma /	The sleeping keśa is the non-manifested klefa, in the state of being a seed; the awakened kleśz is the manifested kesa, the kleśa in action.
ātmabhāvasya kleśajā kleśotpādanaśaktiḥ /	And by “'seed” one should understand a certain capacity to produce the é/eśz, a power belonging to the person engendered by the previous kleśa.
yathānubhavajñānajā smṛtyutpādanaśaktiryathā cāṅkurādīnāṃ śāliphalajā śāliphalotpādanaśaktiriti /	In this same way there exists in a certain person the capacity of producing a consciousness of memory, a capacity engendered by a consciousness of preception; in this same way the capacity to produce rice, which belongs to the plant, the shoot, the stalk, etc. , is engendered by the rice seed.
yastu kleśānāṃ bījārthamarthāntaraṃ vīprayuktamanuśayaṃ kalpayati tena smṛtibījamapyarthāntaraṃ kalpayitavyaṃ jāyate /	The masters for whom the seed of the k/eśa is a certain dharma distinct from the éleśu itself, disassocated from the mind and called an enusśuya, must admit a ḍharma existing in and of itself, disassociated from the mind and the cause of memory. And the same would hold for the plant. You do not have the right to explain “anuśaya of kāmarāga,” for the Sūtra clearly teaches that anuśaya is kāmarāga itself. The Sasatkasutra says, This person has agreeable sensation, and raganusaya.
yattarhi sūtre kleśa evānuśaya uktaḥ ṣaṭṣaṭke “so 'sya bhavati sukhāyāṃ vedanāyāṃ rāgānuśaya” iti /	But the Sutra says, “He has raganusaya;
bhavatīti vacanānnāsau tadaivānuśayaḥ / kadā tarhi bhavati /	” it does not say, “He then has raganusaya.
yadā prasupto bhavati /	” When this sensation ends, desire becomes dormant: then there is only the anusaya of desire, dormant desire, the seed of future awakened desire. Or rather, we would say, when the Sutra says raganusaya, it means raga: the first is the effect of the second, and the cause can be designated by the name of its effect.

One says "in general" because these beings also have attachments with regard to their palaces, vômānas, etc. This attachment, being an absorption, is turned within.

sati duḥkhādisatye nāstīti dṛṣṭirmithyādṛṣṭiḥ /	The view that consists of negating that which really exists, the Truth of Suffering, etc. and which consists of saying nāsti, 'that is not,' is mithyādrṟṣṭi or false view.

You have said that the erroneous view that regards as a cause of the world that which is not a cause of the world is the esteeming of morality and ascetic practices. In this hypothesis, the esteeming of morality and.

It then follows that: If one clings to the idea that the Lord, etc. , is the cause of the world, this is by reason of false conceptions of permanence and personality.
kāraṇābhiniveśo 'to duḥkhadṛggheya eva saḥ //	Thus this clinging is to be abandoned through Seeing of Suffering.
duḥkhadarśanādeva hi teṣu tau nityātmagrāhau prahīyete /	The belief in the eternity or in the personality of the Lord or Prajāpati is abandoned through Seeing the single Truth of Suffering;

duḥkhe vipratipannatvāt /	The doctrine of the Vaibhāṣikas is thus that these two opinions are to be abandoned through the Seeing the Truth of Suffering, because they allow error with regard to suffering. But his argument is carried too far!

Moreover we do not see how the esteeming of morality and ascetic practices could be relative to a dharma to be abandoned through the Truth of the Path:
yasya ca mārgālambanā mithyādṛṣṭirvicikitsā vā 'sti sa nāsti mokṣamārga iti paśyan vicikitsan vā kathaṃ tayā śuddhiṃ pratyeṣyati /	How could a person who entertains wrong views or doubt relative to the Path, thinking “There is no Path,” or “Is there, or is there not, a Path? ,” imagine to obtain purification through this wrong view or through this doubt? If this person, taking up the path of deliverance imagined by the Sāṁkhyas, etc. , says, “This is the path;
athānyaṃ mokṣamārgaṃ parāmṛśya eṣa mokṣamārgo nāstītyāha / so 'pi tenaivānyena śuddhiṃ pratyeti na tayā mithyādṛṣṭyeti / tasyāpyasau mārgadarśanaprahātavyālambano na sidhyati /	the Buddhist Path isnot the path, then this non-Buddhist imagines that he obtains purification through the path of the Sāṁkhyas, and not through wrong views relative to the Path.
yaścāpi samudayanirodhadarśanaprahātavyālambanayā mithyādṛṣṭyā śuddhiṃ pratyeti sa kasmānna taddarśanaheyaḥ /	Furthermore, when a person imagines that he obtains purification through a wrong view abandoned through the Seeing of Arising or Extinction, why is his esteeming of morality and ascetic practices not abandoned through the Seeing of these same two Truths?

kathamātmīyadṛṣṭirviparyāsaḥ / kathaṃ ca na viparyāsaḥ /	How could the idea of things pertaining to a self be part of error with regard to the self?
viparyāsasūtrād /	In fact the Sūtra of the Viparyāsas does not indicate this. (It says simply, “It is an error to say that anātman is ātman”) and the following: “He who sees a self prevailing within the five skandhas sees ‘mine'”
ātmānameva tatra vaśinaṃ paśyennātmīyaṃ paśyatītyātmadṛṣṭirevāsau dvimukhī athāhamityetasmāt mameti dṛṣṭyantaraṃ syāt /	[Thus the view of “mine” differs from the view of 'self,” a view from whence it derives. But we think that the view of self has two parts: to say '"I” and to say “mine.”
mayā mahyamityetadapi syāt /	If the idea of “mine” were a view different from the idea of “I,” then the ideas expressed by other grammatical cases, such as maya or mahyam would thus constitute so many new views. Thus all belief in a self and in things pertaining.
kasmādanye kleśā na viparyāsāḥ /	Are not the other defilements errors because, in order for there to be error, a combination of three characteristics is indispensable?

nitīraṇāt samāropāt ekāntaviparyastatvādālambane nitīrakatvātsamāropaṇācca /	Reflective judgment and affirmation because they allow complete error.
ucchedadṛṣṭirmithyādṛṣṭiśca na samāropike / abhāvamukhapravṛttatvāt /	The view of annihilation, a part of the belief in extremes, and false views are not affirmations or erroneous attributions, since they are directed towards the absence of existence.
śīlavrataparāmarśo naikāntaviparyastastanmātraśuddhyālambanatvāt /	The esteeming of morality and ascetic practices affirms that morality and practices suffice for purification: there is no total error in this, since morality and practices do contribute to purification.
anye kleśā na santīrakā ato na viparyāsāḥ /	The other defilements do not admit of reflective judgment, and as a consequence are not complete errors.
yattarhi sūtre ukta “manitye nityamiti saṃjñāviparyāsaḥ cittaviparyāso dṛṣṭiviparyāsa” iti /	But the Blessed One said, "To consider the impermanent as permanent is an error of idea, an error of thought, and an error of view," and thus following for happiness, purity, and the self. Neither ideas nor thoughts admit of reflective judgment. Thus the definition proposed for error is inexact.
dṛṣṭirevātra viparyāsaḥ / saṃjñācitte tu tadvaśāt //	Thought and idea are termed "error" by reason of view.
dṛṣṭiviparyāsavaśādeva tatsaṃprayukte saṃjñācitte viparyāsāvuktau /	Only view is error, but by virtue of the esteeming of bad views, ideas and thoughts associated with view and having its same aspect are also termed "errors.

loke hi viparyastasaṃjño viparyastacitta iti prasiddhaṃ na punarviparyastavedana iti /	Because one says in worldly language "error of idea," and "error of thought," but not "error of sensation.
ta ete viparyāsāḥ sarve 'pi srota āpannasya prahīṇā bhavanti / darśanapraheyatvāt dṛṣṭīnāṃ sasaṃprayogāṇām / dvādaśa viparyāsāḥ /	A Srotaāpaṇṇa abandons all these errors for the Seeing of the Truths which brings about the abandonment of views also brings about the abandoning of the ideas and thoughts associated with these views.
anitye nityamiti saṃjñādṛṣṭicittaviparyāsāstrayaḥ /	Another School says: The error which consists of holding as permanent that which is impermanent contains three errors: error of idea, of thought and of view;

na caivamanāsravā nāpyevamūrdhvā bhūmiḥ /	But the pure dharmas and the higher bhāmis are not susceptible of being considered as 'self' or as 'pertaining to self': thus the anuśayas which have them for their object do not become.
ato na tadālambanāsteṣvanuśerate / yastvihasthastāṃ bhūmiṃ prārthayate /	We would remark in fact that the desire that seeks either the pure dharmas or a higher sphere is not the enuśaya called “desire,” but rather “an aspiration for good dharmas”.

ato na teṣu pratiṣṭhāṃ labhante /	the dharmas of a higher bhūmi are opposed to the kleśas of a lower bhūmi: as a consequence the k/eśas cannot become anuśayana there, that is, install themselves there;
tapta ivopale talāni pādānām /	in the same way that the sole of the foot cannot install itself on a rock which is red hot with fire. We have up to now understood the word enusśfayana, anuśete, as “ṭo become anuśayana,” in the sense of “to install,” or ““to become lodged in.”
ānuguṇyārtho 'trānuśayārthaḥ / na ca te tadanuguṇā ityapare /	According to some other masters, an#uśayana should be understood as ānuguṇya. Nirvāṇa, etc. , is not favorable to the arising and development of wrong views: in the same way that one says that if a person who has a cold takes a bitter.

Are there any anushayas which do not have the pure dharmas for their object, which do not have a superior Dhātu for their object yet which become anushayana solely through association with and not from the fact of the object?

ucchedadṛṣṭirapi mokṣānukūlā /	The erroneous view of annihilation is favorable to deliverance. This is why the Bleesed One said, “Among the doctrines of the Tīrthikas, the best is that which says, I do not exist, things of mine do not exist;

svargatṛṣṇā 'smimānayorapyevaṃ prasaṅgaḥ / sahajā satkāyadṛṣṭiravyākṛtā /	But these different reasons—because they are not in contradiction to giving, etc—could be applied to the “desire for heaven” and to egotism, which should thus also be neutral; but the School does not admit this. Some ancient masters also say, “An innate belief in a self, which is to be found among the savage animals and birds, is neutral. But a cogitated belief in a self is bad.”

na hi phalotpattikāle varttamāno vipākaheturastīti /	In fact, at the moment when the result is produced, the retributive cause is past.
tasmādastyevātītānāgatamiti vaibhāṣikāḥ / avaśyaṃ ca kilaitatsarvāstivādena satā 'bhyupagantavyam / yasmāt	Therefore, because of the proofs from Scripture and reasoning quoted above, the Vaibhāṣikas affirm the existence of both the past and the future.
tadastivādāt sarvāstivādā iṣṭāḥ	The masters who call themselves Sarvāstivādins, “believers in the existence of all,ʼ maintain that the past and the future exist. He who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods is held to be a Sarvāstivādin.
ye he sarvamastīti vadanti atītamanāmataṃ pratyutpannaṃ ca te sarvāstivādāḥ /	The masters who affirm the existence of all things, past.
ye tu kecidasti yat pratyutpannamadattaphalaṃ cātītaṃ karma kiñcinnāsti yaddattaphalamatītamanāgataṃ ceti vibhajya vadanti te vibhajyavādinaḥ kati caite sarvāstivādā ityāha	Those who affirm the existence of the present and a part of the past, namely the existence of action which has not given forth its result; and the non-existence of the future and a part of the past, namely the non-existence of action which has given forth its result, are regarded as Vibhajyavādins.
caturvidhāḥ // te bhāvalakṣaṇāvasthā 'nyathā 'nyathikasaṃjñitāḥ /	There are four types of Sarvāstivādins accordingly as they teach a difference in existence, a difference in characteristic, a difference in condition, and mutual difference.
bhāvānyathiko bhadantadharmatrātaḥ / sa kilāha /	The Bhadanta Dharmatrāta defends bhāvānyathātva, that is, he affirms that the three time periods, past, present, and future, are differentiated by their non-identity of existence.
dharmasyādhvasu, pravartamānasya bhāvānyathātvaṃ bhavati na dravyānyathātvam /	When a dharma goes from one time period to another its nature is not modified, but its existence is.
yathā suvarṇabhājanasya bhittvā 'nyathā kriyamāṇasya saṃsthānānyathātvaṃ bhavati na varṇānyathātvam /	A gold vase which one breaks is an example which shows the difference of figure: its.
yathā ca kṣīraṃ dadhitvena pariṇamadrasavīryavipākān parityajati na varṇam /	An example which shows difference in qualities: milk becomes whey; its taste, force, and digestibility change, but not its color.
evaṃ dharmo 'pyanāgatādadhvanaḥ pratyutpannamadhvānamāgacchannanāgatabhāvaṃ jahāti na dravyabhāvam /	In the same way, when a future dharma passes from the future into the present, its future existence is abandoned, and its present existence is acquired, but its nature remains the same.
evaṃ pratyutpannādatītamadhvānaṃ gacchan pratyutpannabhāvaṃ jahāti na dravyabhāvamiti /	When it passes from the present into the past, its present existence is abandoned, and its past existence is acquired, but its nature remains the same.
lakṣāṇānyathiko bhadantaghoṣakaḥ / sa kilāha /	The Bhadanta Ghoshaka defends Zakshananyathatva, that is, the time periods differ through the difference in their characteristics.
dharmo 'dhvasu pravarttamāno 'tīto 'tītalakṣaṇayukto 'nāgatapratyutpannābhyāṃ lakṣaṇābhyāmaviyuktaḥ /	A dharma goes through the time periods. When it is past, it is endowed with past characteristics, but it is not deprived of its present and future characteristics;
anāgato 'nāgatalakṣaṇayukto 'tītapratyutpannābhyāmaviyuktaḥ /	when it is future, it is endowed with its future characteristics, but it is not deprived of its present and past characteristics;
evaṃ pratyutpanno 'pyatītānāgatābhyāmaviyuktaḥ /	and when it is present, it is endowed with its present characteristics, but it is not deprived of its past and future characteristics.
tadyathā puruṣa ekasyāṃ striyāṃ raktaḥ śeṣāsvavirakta iti /	Example: a man attached to one woman is not detached with respect to other women.
avasthā 'nyathiko bhadantavasumitraḥ / sa kilāha /	The Bhadanta Vasumitra defends gvasthānyathātva, that is, the time periods differ through the difference of condition.
dharmo 'dhvasu pravartamāno 'vasthāmavasthāṃ prāpyānyo 'nyo nidiśyate avasthāntarato na dravyāntarataḥ /	A dharma, going through the time periods, having taken up a certain condition, becomes different through the difference of its condition, not through a difference in its substance.
yathaikā vartikā ekāṅke nikṣiptā ekamityucyate śatāṅke śataṃ sahasrāṅke sahasramiti /	Example: a token placed on the square of ones, is called one; placed on the square of tens, teṉ; and placed on the square of hundreds, one hundred.
anyathānyathiko bhadantabuddhadevaḥ / sa kilāha /	The Bhadanta Buddhadeva defends anyonyathātva, that is, the time periods are established through their mutual relationships.
dharmo 'dhvasu pravartamānaḥ pūrvāparamapekṣyānyo 'nya ucyate avasthāntarato na dravyāntarataḥ /	A dharma, going throughout the time periods, takes different names through different relationships, that is, it is called past, future, or present, through a relationship with what preceeds and with what follows.
yathaikā strī mātā vocyate duhitā veti / ityete catvāraḥ sarvāstivādāḥ /	For example, the same woman is both a daughter and a mother.
eṣāṃ tu prathamaḥ pariṇāmavāditvāt sāṃkhyapakṣe nikṣeptavyaḥ / dvitīyasyādhvasaṃkaraḥ prāpnoti /	The first, professing "transformation" may be refuted along with the Sāṁkhyas.
sarvasya sarvakṣaṇayogāt /	In the thesis of the second master, the time periods, past, present, and future, are confounded, since the three characteristics are found everywhere.
puruṣasya tu kasyāñcit striyāṃ rāgaḥ samudācarati kasyāñcit kevalaṃ samanvāgama iti kimatra sāmyam /	The example moreover is lacking any similarity to the problem, for, within the man in question, there is active lust with respect to one woman, but there is only the "possession of lust" with respect to other women.
caturthasyāpyekasminnevādhvani trayo 'dhvānaḥ prāpnuvanti / atīte 'dhvani pūrvapaścimau kṣaṇāvatītānāgatau madhyamaḥ kṣaṇaḥ pratyutpanna iti / evamanāgate 'pi / ata eṣāṃ sarveṣāṃ	In the thesis of the fourth master, the three time periods exist at the same time: a past ḍharma, for example, is past in relation to that which precedes it, future in relation to that which follows, and present in relation to what precedes and what follows.
tṛtīyaḥ śobhanaḥ	The third is the best.
yo 'yamavasthā 'nyathikaḥ / tasya kila adhvānaḥ kāritreṇa vyavasthitāḥ //	Consequently the best system is that of Vasumitra.
yadā sa dharmaḥ kāritraṃ na karoti tadā 'nāgataḥ /	The three time periods are proven by reason of their activity, According to which the time periods and the conditions are established through the operation of the activity of a dharma: when a dharma does not accomplish its operation, it is future.
yadā karoti tadā pratyutpannaḥ /	When it is accomplishing it, it is present;
yadā kṛtvā niruddhastadā 'tīta iti / parigatametatsarvam / idaṃ tu vaktavyam /	and when its operation has come to an end, it is past.
yadyatītamapi dravyato 'styanāgatamiti / kasmāttadatītamityucyate 'nāgatamiti vā / nanu coktamadhvānaḥ kāritreṇa vyavasthitā iti /	If the past and the future exist as things, they are present: why are they thus qualified as past and future? It is action not yet completed, in the act of being completed, or already completed, which determine the time period of a dharma. Good enough.
yadyevaṃ pratyutpannasya tatsabhāgasya cakṣuṣaḥ kiṃ kāritram /	But what action would you assign to a $atsabhāga eye? The action of an eye is to see, and a ta; sabhāga eye does not now see.
phaladānapratigrahaṇam /	Would you say that its action is to project and to give forth a result?
atītānāmapi tarhi sabhāgahetvādīnāṃ phaladānāt kāritraprasaṅgo 'rdhakāritrasya veti lakṣaṇasaṃkaraḥ /	But then if giving forth a result is an “action,” then sabhāgahetu causes, etc. give forth their result when they are past, and so one arrives at the conclusion that they accomplish their action in the past and so would be as a consequence in the present. Or if an action, in order to be complete, calls for a projection and a giving forth of a result, these past causes would be at least semi-present. Thus the time periods are confounded.
idaṃ ca vaktavyam / tenaivātmanā sato dharmasya nityaṃ kāritrakaraṇe	But, if it always exists, why doesn't a dharma always exercise its activity?
kiṃ vighnaṃ yena kadācit kāritraṃ karoti kadācinneti /	What obstacle causes it to sometimes produce and sometimes not to produce its action?
pratyayānāmasāmagrayamiti cet / na / nityamāstitvābhyupagamāt /	One cannot say that its inaction results from the non-presence of certain causes, since these causes also always exist. How can activity be past, etc. ? And how can activity itself be past, etc. P Would you imagine a second activity of activity? That would be absurd. But if the activity, in and of itself, is past, etc. , why not admit that the same holds for the dharma?
yacca tat kāritramatītānāgataṃ pratyutpannaṃ cocyate tatkathaṃ kiṃ kāritrasyāpyanyadasti kāritram /	And who says that the time periods depend on past activity, etc. ?
atha tannaivātītaṃ nāpyanāgataṃ na pratyutpannamasti ca /	Would you say that activity is neither past, present, nor future, but that, nevertheless, it exists?
tenāsaṃskṛtatvānnityamastīti prāptam / ato na vaktavyaṃ yadā karitraṃ na karoti dharmastadā 'nāgata iti /	Then, being unconditioned, it is eternal, and how can you then say that a dharma is future when it does not exercise its activity, or past when it no longer exercises it?
syādeṣa doṣo yadi dharmāt kāritramanyatsyāt /	These objections would hold, if activity were other than the dharma itself.
tattu khalu nānyat ato na bhavatyeṣa doṣaḥ / evaṃ tahi sa eva adhvāyogaḥ	But it is not other than the dharma.
yadi dharma eva kāritraṃ kasmātsa eva dharmastenaivātmanā vidyamānaḥ kadācidatīta ityucyate kadācidanāgata ityadhvanāṃ vyavasthā na sidhyati	If activity is the same as the dharma, and if the dharma always exists, its activity would also always exist. Why and how does one say that sometimes it is past, sometimes future? The distinction of the time periods is not justified.
kimatra na sidhyati /	How is it not justified?
yo hyajāto dharmaḥ so 'nāgataḥ /	In fact, a conditioned dharma which has not arisen is called future;
yo jāto bhavati na ca vinaṣṭaḥ sa varttamānaḥ /	that which, having arisen, is not destroyed, is called present;
yo vinaṣṭaḥ so 'tītaḥ iti / etadevātra vaktavyam /	and that which is destroyed is called past.
yadi yathā varttamānaṃ dravyato 'sti tathā 'tītamanāgataṃ cāsti /	If, in the past and future, a dharma exists with the same nature as when it is present,
tasya tathā sataḥ / ajātanaṣṭatā kena	Existing in the same manner, how can it be non-arisen or destroyed?
tenaiva svabhāvena sato dharmasya kathamidaṃ sidhyatyajāta iti yo vinaṣṭaḥ iti veti /	If the unique self-nature of a dharma continues to exist, how can this dharma be non-arisen or destroyed?
kimasya pūrvaṃ nāsīdyasyābhāvādajāta ityucyate /	What is it that it is lacking now, through the absence of which it is qualified as non-arisen?
kiṃ ca paścānnāsti yasyābhāvā dvinaṣṭa ityucyate / tasmānna sidhyati sarvathā 'pyatrādhvatrayam / yadyabhutvā bhavatīti neṣyate bhūtvā ca punarna bhavatīti /	What is it that it is lacking later, through the absence of which it is qualified as destroyed?
yadapyuktaṃ “saṃskṛtalakṣaṇayogānna śāśvatatvaprasaṅga” iti / tadidaṃ kevalaṃ vāṅmātramutpādavināśayorayogāt /	Consequently, if one does notThe argument that, possessing the characteristics of conditioned things, conditioned things are not eternal even though they exist both in the past and in the future, is pure verbiage, for, if it always exists, a dharma is not susceptible either of arising or of perishing.
nityaṃ ca nāmāsti sa dharmo na ca nitya ityapūrvaiṣā vāco yuktiḥ / āha khalvapi	“A dharma is eternal, and it is not eternal:” to speak in this manner is to contradict oneself through one’s own words.
“svabhāvaḥ sarvadā cāsti bhāvo nityaśca neṣyate / na ca svabhāvād bhāvo 'nyo vyaktamīśvaraceṣṭitam /“ yattūktamuktatvāditi /	This is what the stanza explains when it says, “Self nature always exists, but this does not mean that being is eternal, nor that being is different from its self nature: this is clearly stated by the Lord.”
vayamapi brūmo 'styatītānāgatamiti /	With regard to the argument that the Blessed One taught the existence of the past and the future since he said “Past action exists, and future results exist”, we would also say that the past exists, and that the future exists.
atītaṃ tu yad bhūtapūrvam /	Past is that which was existent.
anāgataṃ yatsati hetau bhaviṣyati / evaṃ ca kṛtvā 'stītyucyate na tu punardravyataḥ /	The future is that which, given its cause, will exist; it is in this sense that we say that the past and the future exists. But they do not exist as substantial entities as does the present.
kaścaivamāha / vartamānavattadastīti /	Who says that they exist like the present?
kathamanyathā 'sti /	If they don't exist like the present, how do they exist?
atītā nāgatātmanā / idaṃ punastavopasthitam /	The Sarvāstivādins answer: They exist with the nature of the past and the future.
kathaṃ tadatītamanāgataṃ cocyate yadi nityamastīti /	But, if they now exist, how can one attribute the nature of past and future to them?
tasmāt bhūtapūrvasya ca hetorbhāvinaśca phalasya bhūtapūratāṃ bhāvitāṃ ca jñāpayituṃ hetuphalāpavādadṛṣṭipratiṣedhārthamuktaṃ bhagavatā “astyatītamastyanāgatami“ti	In fact, the Blessed One, in a text quoted by the Sarvāstivādins, had the intention of condemning the view that negates cause and effect. He said "the past exists" in the sense of "the past was; " he said "the future exists" in the sense of "the future will be.
astiśabdasya nipātatvāt / yathā 'sti dīpasya prāgabhāvo 'sti paścādabhāva iti vaktāro bhavanti yathā cāsti niruddhaḥ sa dīpo na tu mayā nirodhita iti /	" The word "is" is a nipāka in the same sense as the expressions, "There is previous non-existence of the lamp," "there is later non-existence of the lamp," and again, "This lamp is extinguished, but it was not extinguished by me.
evamatītānāgatamapyastītyuktam /	" It is in this same way that the text says "the past exists, and the future exists.
anyathā hyatītānāgatabhāva eva na sidhyet /	"To understand otherwise, being in the past, the past would not now be the past.
yattarhi laguḍaśikhīyakānparivrājakānadhikṛṭyoktaṃ bhagavatā “yatkarmābhyatītaṃ kṣīṇaṃ niruddhaṃ vigataṃ vipariṇataṃ tadastī“ti /	We see that the Blessed One, addressing the Lāguḍaśikhīyaka ascetics, expressed himself in this way, “Past action, which has been destroyed, which has perished, and which has ceased, does exist.” According to the proposed explanation, the sense would be, “This action was.”
kiṃ te tasya tasya karmaṇo bhūtapūrvatvaṃ necchanti sma /	Now can we suppose that the ascetics would not admit that past action has already passed away?
tatra punastadāhitaṃ tasyāṃ saṃtatau phaladānasāmarthyaṃ saṃdhāyoktam /	When the Blessed One says that past action exists, he had in view its power of giving forth a result, a power which was placed in the series of the agent through action which has now passed away.
anyathā hi svena bhāvena vidyamānamatītaṃ na sidhyet /	To understand otherwise, that is, if past action actually exists now in and of itself, how can it be considered as past?
itthaṃ caitadevaṃ yat paramārthaśūnyatayāmuktaṃ bhagavatā “cakṣurutpadyamānaṃ na kutaścidāgacchati nirudhyamānaṃ na kvacitsaṃnicayaṃ gacchati	Of the rest, Scripture contains a formal declaration. The Blessed One said in the Paramārthaśūnyatāsñt¢ra,'The eye, Oh Bhikṣus, arising, does not come from any place; perishing, it does ṇot remain in any place.
iti hi bhikṣavaścakṣurabhūtvā bhavati bhūtvā ca pratigacchatī“ti	In this way, Oh Bhikṣus, the eye exists.
yadi cānāgataṃ cakṣuḥ syānnoktaṃ syād bhūtvā na bhavatīti /	If a future eye existed, the Blessed One would not have said that the eye exists only after having been non-existent.
varttamāne 'dhvanyabhūtvā bhavatīti cet na / adhvano bhāvādanarthāntaratvāt /	The expression, “It exists after having been non-existent” signifies “after having been non-existent in the present”, that is, “after having been non-existent as present”. This is inadmissible, for the time periods do not differ from the eye.
atha svātmanyabhūtvā bhavati /	Does this mean that one should understand this as, “After having been non-existent in its own nature?”
siddhamidamanāgataṃ cakṣurnāstīti /	But this is to explicitly acknowledge that a future eye does not now exist.
yadapyuktaṃ “dvayaṃ pratītya vijñānasyotpādāditi idaṃ tāvadiha saṃpradhāryam / yanmanaḥ pratītya dharmaścotpadyate manovijñānaṃ kiṃ tasya yathā manojanakaḥ pratyaya evaṃ dharmā āhosvidālambanamātraṃ dharmā iti /	As for the argument that “the past and the future exist, since the consciousness arises by reason of two things,” should one understand that since the mental consciousness arises by reason of a mental organ and past, present, or future dharmas, these dharmas are a necessary condition for the mental consciousness to arise to the same extent as is the mental organ, that is, in the.
yadi tāvat janakaḥ pratyayo dharmāḥ kathaṃ yadanāgataṃ kalpasahasreṇa bhaviṣyati vā na vā tadidānīṃ vijñānaṃ janayiṣyati /	Evidently futare dharmas, which will be produced after thousands of yeats or which will never be produced, are not the generating causes of a present mental consciousness.
nirvāṇaṃ ca sarvapravṛttinirodhājjanakaṃ nopapadyate /	Evidently Nirvāṇa, which is contradictory to all arising, cannot be a generating cause.
athālambanamātraṃ dharmā bhavanti / atītānāgatamapyālambanaṃ bhavatīti brūmaḥ /	It is enough that the dharmas are a condition for the arising of a consciousness in their qualtiy of being an object: let us admit that it is thus for future and past dharmas.
yadi nāsti kathamālambanam / atredānīṃ brūmaḥ /	If the past and future dharmas do not exist, how can they be the objects of consciousness? They exist in the manner in which they are taken as objects.
yadā tadālambanaṃ tathāsti kathaṃ tadālambanam abhūt bhaviṣyati ceti /	And in what manner are they taken as objects? They are taken as objects with the mark of the past and the future, as having existed or as coming into existence.
na hi kaścidatītaṃ rūpaṃ vedanāṃ vā smarannastīti paśyati / kiṃ tarhi /	In fact, a person who remembers a past visible object of a past sensation, does not see “this is;
abhūditi /	” but he remembers “this was; ” the man who foresees the future does not see the future as existing, but he.
yathā khalvapi varttamānaṃ rūpamanubhūtaṃ tathā tadatītaṃ smaryate / yathā cānāgataṃ varttamānaṃ bhaviṣyati tathā buddhyā gṛhyate /	Memory grasps a visible thing that has been seen, a sensation that has been felt, that is, a visible object and a sensation in a present state of being.
yadi ca tattathaivāsti vartamānaṃ prāpnoti /	If a dharma which one remembers is, in fact, the one grasped by the memory, it is presently manifested;
atha nāsti / asadapyālambanaṃ bhavatīti siddham / tadeva tadvikīrṇamiti cet /	if it is not one that one grasps through the memory, then the memory consciousness certainly has a non-existent object.
na / vikīrṇasyāgrahaṇāt / yadi ca tattadeva rūpaṃ kevalaṃ paramāṇuśo vibhaktam /	Would one say that past and future visible objects exist without being present, because past or future visible objects are nothing other than atoms in a state of dispersion? But we would say: when the consciousness takes as its object, through memory or prevision, a past or future visible object, it does not take it as an object in a state of dispersion, but on the contrary, as an assembled collection of atoms;
evaṃ sati paramāṇavo nityāḥ prāpnuvanti / paramāṇusaṃcaryāvabhāgamātraṃ caivaṃ sati prāpnoti /	if a past or future visible object is the visible object of the present with this small difference that the atoms are dispersed, then the atoms are thus eternal;
na tu kiñcidutpadyate nāpi nirudhyata ityājīvikavāda ālambito bhavati /	there is never either production nor.
sūtraṃ cāpaviddhaṃ bhavati “cakṣurutpadyamānaṃ na kutaścidāgacchatī“ti vistaraḥ /	To maintain such a thesis is to adopt the doctrine of the Ājīvikas and to reject the Sūtras of the Sugata: “The eye, Oh Bhikṣus, arising, does not come from any place.
aparamāṇusaṃcitānāṃ vedanādīnāṃ kathaṃ vikīrṇatvam /	” The argument does not hold for sensation and other “non-solid” dharmas: not being combinations of atoms, we do not see how they can be, in the past or in the future, atoms in a state of dispersion.
te 'pi ca yathotpannānubhūtāḥ smaryante /	In fact, moreover, one remembers the sensation as it was experienced when it was present; one foresees it as it will be experienced when it will be present.
yadi ca te tathaiva santi nityāḥ prāpnuvanti / atha na santi / asadapyālambanamiti siddham /	If, past and future, it is such that one grasps it through memory or prevision, it would be eternal. Thus the mental consciousness termed “memory” has a non-existent object, namely a sensation that does not now presently exist.
yadyasadapyālambanaṃ syāt trayodaśamapyāyatanaṃ syāt /	If that which does not absolutely exist can be the object of consciousness, then a thirteenth āya$tana could be the object of consciousness.
atha trayodaśamāyatanaṃ nāstītyasya vijñānasya kimālambanam /	Then what is, according to you, theIt is its name, “thirteenth āyatana.”

śabda eva /	The object of this consciousness is the sound itself.
evaṃ tarhi yaḥ śabdābhāvaṃ prārthayate tasya śabda eva kartavyaḥ syāt /	Then, anyone who is in quest of the non-existence of sound should make a noise! No, for the sound of which there is previous non-existence, exists in a future state, and it is this sound in its futuṟe state which is the object of the previously non-existent conṅsciousness.
anāgatāvasya iti cet / sati kathaṃ nāstibuddhiḥ /	But if future sound, of which there is previous non-existence, exists in fact, how can there be the idea that it does not now exist?

Or, if there is aIf you recognize the distinctive characteristic of the present exists after not having existed, then you understand the difference between future and present sound and the idea "it does not now exist.
tasmādubhayaṃ vijñānasyālambanam bhāvaścābhāvaśca /	" We must prove that existence and non-existence can be objects of consciousness.
yattarhi bodhisattvenoktam “yattat loke nāstitadahaṃ jñāsyāmi vā drakṣyāmi vā nedaṃ sthānaṃ vidyata” iti /	If a non-existent thing can be an object of consciousness, how could the Bodhisattva in his last existence say, "It is impossible that I know, that I see that which does not exist in this world?
apare ābhimānikā bhavantyasantamapyavabhāsaṃ santaṃ paśyanti / ahaṃ tu santamevārstīti paśyāmītyayaṃ tatrābhiprāyaḥ /	" The meaning of this text is clear: "I am not like other prideful ascetics who attribute to themselves a non-existent 'Illumination': as for me, I only see as existing that which is. " Moreover, to admit your thesis, the object of any idea would be real;
itarathā hi sarvabuddhīnāṃ sadālambanatve kuto 'sya vimarśaḥ syāt ko vā viśeṣaḥ /	if all that one thinks is real, there is no longer any place for doubt or examination; there would be no difference between the Bodhisattva and others.

sadālambanatvādvijñānasyeti /	Consequently the reason that the Sarvāstivādins gave in favor of the existence of the past and the future, that is, “because the object of the consciousness is existent” does not hold.
yadaṣyuktaṃ phalāditi /	The Sarvāstivādins also deduce an argument from the result of action.

dṛṣṭiyogācchīlavrataṃ niṣkṛṣya dṛṣṭyu pādānaṃ triṃśaddravyāṇi /	The clinging to views is made up of the yoke of views without the esteeming of morality and ascetic practices: in all thirty things.
śīlavratopādānaṃ ṣaḍdravyāṇi karmadṛṣṭibhyo niṣkṛṣṭam /	Clinging to morality and ascetic practices is made up of the six remaining things. Why distinguish "the presumption of morality and of ascetic practices" from the other views and make it a separate clinging?
mārgapratidvandvitvā dubhayapakṣavipralambhanācca /	Because it is in opposition to the Path and deludes the two.
gṛhiṇo 'pyanena vipralabdhā anaśanādibhiḥ svargamārgasaṃjñayā pravrajitā apīṣṭaviṣayaparivarjanena śuddhipratyāgamanāditi /	The laity are deluded with expectations of obtaining heaven through abstinence, etc. and clerics are deluded with expectations of obtaining purity through the renouncing of agreeable things.
kiṃ kāraṇamavidyāṃ miśrayitvopādānamuktaṃ na pṛthak / bhavagrahaṇādupādānāni /	But why doesn't ignorance constitute a separate clinging?

asaṃprakhyānalakṣaṇatayā 'paṭutvādavidyā na grāhikā bhavatyataḥ kila miśritā /	Ignorance has non-intellection for its characteristic; it is not at all sharp; thus it does not grasp; therefore, say the School, it is only mixed with the other defilements as is clinging.
sūtre tu bhagavatoktaṃ “kāmayogaḥ katamaḥ / vistareṇa yāvadyo 'sya bhavati kāmeṣu kāmarāgaḥ kāmacchandaḥ kāmasnehaḥ kāmaprema	But, we would say, the Blessed One said in the Sūtra, ““What is the yoke of the object of sensual pleasure?

atha ko 'yamanuśayārthaḥ kaśca yāvadupādānārthaḥ /	Thus chandarāga with respect to the objects of pleasure, views, etc. , is what is called clinging to the objects of pleasure, etc. What is the meaning of the words anufaya, āsrava, ogha, yoga and upādāna?
aṇavo 'nugatāścaite dvidhā cāpyanuśerate /	They are atomic; they adhere; they nourish themselves in two ways;
anubadhnanti yasmācca tasmādanuśayāḥ smṛtāḥ //	they continually bind: this is why they are termed anuśayas.

anugatāḥ prāptyanuṣaṅgataḥ /	They adhere through the adhesion of their prāptis;
anuśerate dvābhyāṃ prakārābhyāmālambanataḥ saṃprayogataśca /	they nourish themselves in two ways, both from the object and from the dharmar with which they are associated;
anubadhnantyaprayogeṇa prativārayato 'pi punaḥ punaḥ saṃmukhībhāvāt / ebhiḥ kāraṇairanuśayā ucyante /	and they continually bind, for, unless one makes an effort, and even when one creates an obstacle to them, they will appear and reappear.
āsayantyāsravantyete haranti śleṣayantyatha /	They fix and they flow, they carry away, they attach, they seize: such is the etymology of the words āsravas, etc. The anuśayas fix, “seat” beings in transmigration.
upagṛhṇanti cetyeṣāmāsravādiniruktayaḥ //	They flow from the highest heaven to Avīci;
āsayanti saṃsāre āsravanti bhavāgrādyāvadavīciṃ ṣaṅbhirāyatanavraṇair ityāsravāḥ /	they flow out by the six organs which are as wounds. They are thus called cankerous influences, or āsravas.
harantītyoghāḥ /	The anuśayas carry away; they are thus called oghas or floods. “The anuśayas cause beings to be attached;
śleṣayantīti yogāḥ /	they are thus called yogas or yokes.
upagṛhṇantīti upadānāni /	The anuśayas seize; they are thus called uwpādānas or clingings.
evaṃ tu sādhīyaḥ syād /	The best explanation is the following. By means of the auśayas, the mental series flows into the objects;
āsravatyebhiḥ saṃtatirviṣayeṣvityāsravāḥ /	the an#fayas are thus āsravas or cankerous influences.
“tadyathā āyuṣmanto naurmahadbhirabhisaṃskāraiḥ pratisroto nīyate /	In conformity with the comparison of the Śūtra “In the same way that one makes great efforts in order to steer a boat against the current but when these efforts begin to weaken, the boat is carried with the stream;

adhimātravegatvādoghāḥ / tarhi tadvānuhyate tadanuvidhānāt /	When they are very violent, the @nuśayas are called oghas; in fact they carry away, as in a flood, those who are bound to them.
nātimātrasamudācāriṇo 'pi yogā vividhaduḥkhasaṃyojanāt /	When they do not enter into activity with an extreme violence, the anufayas are called yogas, because they yoke one to the very many sufferings of transmigration;
ābhīkṣṇyānuṣaṅgato vā kāmādyupādānādupādānānīti /	or rather because they adhere with obstinance.
saṃyojanādibhedena punaste pañcadhoditāḥ /	The anuxśayas are called upādānas, because, through their action, one clings to things of the senses, etc. These same anuśayas or latent defilements which make up four categories—cankerous influences, floods, yokes, and clingings,— also make up five categories: saṁyojanas or connections , bandhanas or bonds , anuśayas, upakleśas , and paryavasthāṇnas oṛ wrappings.

Yes.
āha syāt samudayajñāne utpanne nirodhajñāne 'nutpanne nirodhamārgadarśānaprahātavyeṣu dṛṣṭiśīlavrataparāmarśasaṃprayukteṣu dharmeṣu /	Let us consider a person who has produced the knowledge of the Arising of Suffering but not the knowledge of the Extinction of Suffering.

teṣvanunayasaṃyojanena saṃyuktastadālambanena dṛṣṭisaṃyojanenāsaṃyuktaḥ /	This person will be attached to these dharmas through the connection of affection, but not through the connection of views;
sarvatragasya prahīṇatvādasarvatragasya ca tadālambanasaṃprayogiṇo dṛṣṭisaṃyojanasyābhāvāt /	for he has abandoned the universal connection of views which is abandoned through the Truths of Suffering and the Arising of Suffering, and there does not exist in him any non-universal connection of views which bears on these dbarmas or which is associated with them.
dṛṣṭyanuśayaśca teṣvanuśete / te eva parāmarśaḍṛṣṭī saṃprayogataḥ /	Nevertheless latent defilement of views is active with respect to these dharmas, for the two drṣṭis which are esteeming and which have not yet been abandoned, are active through association.
kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ saṃyojaneṣu tisro dṛṣṭayo dṛṣṭisaṃprayojanaṃ pṛthaguktaṃ dve punardṛṣṭī parāmarśāsaṃyojanaṃ pṛthak /	Why does one makes one connection—the connection of views—out of the first three views, and another connection,. —the connection of esteeming—out of the last two?
dravyāmarśana sāmānyāddṛṣṭī saṃyojanāntaram //	Two views constitute separate coṇnection by treason of their equal number of things, and by reason of their.

These two characteristics are not encountered in the other wrappings.
yasyāṣṭau paryavasthānāni tasyevaṃ syāt /	According to another opinion, this reason is good for the master who admits only eight wrappings;

tribhiḥ sattvāvaratāṃ nātikrāmati pṛthagjanatvaṃ dvābhyāṃ dhātvavaratāṃ kāmadhātum / ata eva tānyavarabhāgīyānītyapare /	According to another opinion, it is by reason of the three that one does not leave the state of being inferior, namely a Pr̥thagjana; and it is by reason of the two that one does not get out. The Blessed One said, in fact, that one becomes a Srotaāpannṇa by the complete abandoning of the three connections in question.

It appears that the Blessed One should term these views connections favorable to the quality of Prthagjana.

By indicating the first three as connections, the Blessed One indicates the gate to the.
dṛṣṭiparāmarśaḥ śīlavrataparāmarśapravartitaḥ mithyādṛṣṭirvicikitsāpravatitā / mūlaṃ gṛhītamiti /	He also indicates the root, for a belief in the extremes is set into motion by a belief in a self, the esteeming of views by the esteeming of morality and ascetic practices, and false views by doubt.

Pati sources on the abandoning of the defilements, below note 22. apacayaṁ gacchanti. lpso facto 'to accumulate' means to gain force and fruitfulness, "to necessarily produce a retribution"; vipākadánāya niyatābhavanti. See iv:50 and 3. Bhavua can be understood in the sense of punarbhava, tebirth or new existence; or, as in the formula for Pratītyasamutpāda, in the sense of karmabhava, that is, action, for action only accumulates by reason of the anusayas. The author explains below the roles of desire, action and ignorance in the production of a new existence. As we sce in the Bhāṣya, kleśfa is the equivalent of anuaya for the Sarvāstivādins. For the Sarvāstivādins, the anaśaya of a kleśa, for example kāmarāga or sensual desire, is the kesa itself; for the Vātsīputrīyas, it is the prāpti or possession of this klefa: a person who is not ptesently bound by the defilement, “possesses” the defilement that he has had and which he will have; for the Śautrāntikas, it is the seed of the é/ea, the doṟmant kleśa. yaḥ kleśo yaddhātukaḥ sa kaṁ dhātuṁ nātikrāmayati. Samghabhadra adds: it puts one in a bad state, it makes one unfit; it is hostile to spititual qualties (guṇáṉ dveṣṭś), it provokes shameful actions and makes someone the object of blame; it makes one leave the good path, for its disposes one to follow erroneous mastets; it plaats the seeds of all sufferings of transmigration; and it causes the physical universe to detetiorate.

śrīlāmāvākasya yadatra puṇyam /	60, Vibhaṅga, p. The most likely explanation is the following. rāgapa hāna is an explosion of rāga, rāga in action. We can understand Vibhaṅga, p. 383 as referring to rāga in a subtle state, as potential = rāg the manifested rāga = rāgapariyuṭṭhāna; and rāga as a bond = rāgasaṁyojaṇa.
ṣaṣṭhaṃ kośasthānam namo buddhāya	According to the Kośa, v. 47, paryavasthāna is a synonym for klea, defilement (but the Sūtra quoted can be understood: rāgaparyavasthāna = an explosion of desire).

This objection is useless for if Aryans once they become detached no longer cherish it it is then from another point of view that it is undesirable to them.
na tu khalu svalakṣaṇākāreṇa /	Consequently, it is not from the poiat of view of its intrinsic nature, but from another point of view that Āryans do not cherish agreeable sensation. Rather, they hate it for its defects: it is the occasion for the loss of good dharmas, it is acquired only at great effort, it is directed toward suffering, and it is impermanent;

tatra sūkhaṃ vedanāṃ paryāyeṇa duḥkhaṃ satīmekāntasukhāṃ paśyato viparyāsaḥ /	Now agreeable sensation is in a certain sense suffering: to consider it as absolutely agreeable is an error. Delectable objects contain much suffering, but little pleasure; to consider them as absolutely agreeable is an error.

A cause of pleasure is thus always a cause of pleasure.

Before this suffering has arisen or when it is destroyed, in the absence of any remedy, one will all the more experience pleasure.

This thesis of the Abhidharma that the Truth of Suffering is the Truth of Origin, that is, that the wpādānaskandhas, which are suffering, are at the same time the origin of suffering comes from the teaching of the Sūtra. For, according to the Sūtra, it is only thirst or desire which is the origin of.

tasmādābhiprāyikaḥ sūtreṣu nirdeśo lākṣaṇikastvabhidharme /	Thus the definition of the Sūtra, “Desire is the origin of suffering”, is conceived from a particular point of view, whereas the definition given ia the Abhidharma is in strict conformity to the characteristics of the thing defined.
api tvabhinirvṛttihetuṃ brūvatā samudayasatyaṃ tṛṣṇaivoktā /	Furthermore, when the Buddha said, “It is desire which is the origin,” he intended to define the cause of re-existence.
upapattyabhinirvṛttihetuṃ sahetukaṃ brūvatā gāthāyāṃ karma ca tṛṣṇā cāvidyoktā /	When, in the stanza, he enumerates action, desire, and ignorance, he defined the cause of different births which is action; the cause of re-existence, namely desire; and the cause of births and of re-existence, namely ignorance. We shall continueThe explanation of the meaning of these terms.
“karmaheturūpapattaye tṛṣṇāheturabhinirvṛttaya” iti sūtre vacanāt /	In fact, the Sūtṛa says, `‘Action is the cause of births, and desire is the cause of re-existence’ʼ; and it teaches the successive order of causation: "The eye has action for its object; action has desire for its cause; desire has ignorance for its cause; and ignorance has incorrect judgment for its cause.
sahetusapratyayasanidānasūtrakrameṇa vā bījakṣetrabhāvaṃ pratipādayatā vijñānādayo 'ṣyuktāḥ /	That consciousness and the other skandhas are the origin of suffering results again from the fact that the Sūtra declares that they are respectively seed and field.
kā punaruṣapattiḥ kā cābhinirvṛttiḥ /	What is birth? What is re-existence?
dhātugatiyonyādiprakārabhedenātmabhāvasyoṣapadanamupapattiḥ / abhedena punarbhavapratisaṃdhānamabhinirvṛttiḥ /	Upapatti signifies a birth or an existence characterized by a certain sphere, a certain realm of rebirth (god, human, etc. ), a certain mode of birth (birth from a womb, from an egg, etc. ), a certain gender, etc. Dbhinirvr̥ti signifies re-existence without qualification.

vītatṛṣṇasya janmābhāvāt / ubhaye 'pi briyante / satṛṣṇā vītatṛṣṇāśca /	From the fact that a person free from desire is not reborn.
satṛṣṇā eva jātā dṛśyante na vītatṛṣṇā iti /	When a person endowed with desire and a person free from desire die, we know that the first is reborn and that the second is not reborn.
vinā tṛṣṇayā janmābhāvāt /	Therefore since there is no rebirth where there is no desire, we know that desire is the cause of re-existence.
bhavasyābhinirvṛttau tṛṣṇāhetuṃ pratīmaḥ / saṃtatinamanācca /	Again from the fact that the series is bent by desire.
yatra ca satṛṣṇā tatrābhīkṣṇaṃ cittasaṃtatiṃ namantīṃ paśyāmaḥ /	We state that the series of thoughts is unceasingly bent towards the object to which one has a desire.

na cātmabhāva evaṃ kenacidāgṛhīto yathā tṛṣṇayā / śuṣkamasūropasnānalepāṅgavat /	There is no defilement which adheres to the person as much as desire, the same way that lentil paste, once it is dried, adheres to a limb.

tatra cānyānapohya dharmān buddhacyā tadbuddhirna bhavati taccāpi saṃvṛtisadveditavyam / tadyathāmbu /	If the idea of a thing disappears when this thing is dissipated, or broken to pieces, by the mind, then this thing should be regarded as having relative existence; for example, water.
tatra hi buddhacyā rūpādīndharmānaṣohyāmbubuddhirna bhavati /	If we grasp and remember the dharmas, such as color, etc. , in the water, then the idea of water will disappear.
teṣveva tu saṃvṛtisaṃjñā kṛteti saṃvṛtivaśāt ghaṭaścāmbu cāstīti brūbantaḥ satyamevāhurna mṛṣetyetatsaṃvṛtisatyam /	These things,--jug, clothes, etc. , water, fire, etc. ,--are given their different names from the relative point of view or conforming to conventional usage. Thus if one says, from the relative point of view, ““There is a jug, there is water,” one is speaking truly, andConsequently this is relatively true.
atonyathā paramārtha satyam / tatra bhinne 'poi tadbudhirbhavatyeva /	That which differs is absolute truth.
anyadharmāpohe 'pi buddhacyā tat paramārthasat /	If, when a thing is broken to pieces or dissipated by the mind, the idea of this thing continues, then this thing has absolute existence;
tadyathā rūpam / tatra hi paramāṇuśo bhinne vastuni rasārhānapi ca dharmānapohya buddhacyā rūpasya svabhāvabuddhirbhavatyeva /	for example, physical matter: one can reduce physical matter into atoms, one can remember smell and other dharmas in the mind, but the idea of the unique nature of physical matter persists.
evaṃ vedanādayo 'pi draṣṭavyāḥ / etat paramārthena bhāvāt paramārthasatyamiti /	The same holds for sensations, etc. And as this absolutely exists, it is absolutely true.
yathā lokottarena jñānena gṛhyate tat pṛṣṭhalabdhena vā laukikena tathā paramārthasatyam / yathānyena tathā saṃvṛtisatyam iti pūrvācāryāḥ / uktāni satyāni /	The ancient masters say: Things are absolutely true in the manner in which they are perceived, either by transworldly knowledge or by the worldly knowledge acquired after transworldly knowledge. They are relatively true in the manner in which they are perceived by any other defiled or non-defiled worldly knowledge.

nāmārthālambanā cintāmayī / kadācidvacyañjanenārthamākarṣati kadācidarthena vyañjanam /	wisdom arisen from reflection has the name and the thing for its object: in fact, sometimes it grasps the thing by means of the name, and sometimes it grasps the name by means of the thing.
arthalamvanaiva bhāvanāmayī / sā hi vyañjananirapekṣā arthe pravartate /	Wisdom arisen from meditation has the.
tadyathā 'mbhasi plotumaśikṣitaḥ plavanneva muñcati /	One can compare this to three persons who are crossing a river: one who does not know how to swim does not abandon even for one moment his swimming apparatus;

yāhi nāmālambanā śrutamayī prāpnoti yā 'rthālambanā bhāvanāmayīti /	But, we would say, in this interpretation, wisdom arisen from reflection plays no role: in fact, when it has name for its object, it is wisdom arisen from the teaching, and when it has a thing for its object, it is the wisdom arisen from meditation.
idaṃ tu lakṣaṇaṃ nāniravadyaṃ vidyate /	Thus the wisdom arisen from reflection does not exist.
āptavacanaprāmāṇyajātaniścayaḥ śrutamayī /	Rather, one should explain: the wisdom arisen from the teaching is a certitude which arises from a means of correct knowledge termed “the word of a qualified person”;
yuktinidhyānajaścintāmayī /	the wisdom arisen from reflection is a certitude born of rational examination; and the.
samādhijjo bhāvanāmayīti / hetau mayaṭvidhānāt /	Wisdom arisen from meditation is a certitude arisen from absorption. In this way the specific characteristics of the three wisdoms are proved in an irreprochable manner.

Thus the loathsome visualization which has bones for its object is opposed to all of the cravings. The loathsome visualization does not have the abandoning of the defilements for its result, but only an arresting of the defilements, for it is an act of attention bearing not on reality but on a voluntary representation; and bearing not on the totality of things, but only on one part of the visible of Kāmadhātu.

tathaiva ca punardvitīyāmadhimucyate yāvadvihārārāmakṣetrakrameṇa samudraparyantām pṛthivīmasthisaṃkalāṃ pūrṇāmadhimucyate 'dhimokṣābhivardhanārtham	In this same way, in order to increase his power of visualization, he creates the same idea of a second individual, of the individuals of the Vihāra, of the Ārāma, of the village, of the country, up to the earth surrounded by the ocean, as full of skeletons.
punaśca saṃkṣipanyāvadekāmeva svamasthisaṃkalāmadhimucyate cittasaṃkṣepārtham /	Then he reduces his visualization, in order to strengthen his power of visualization, to the point where he only sees his own body as a skeleton.

so 'rdhamapi kapālasya muktvā brūvormadhye cittaṃ dhārayati /	He again makes an abstraction of the half of the skull and holds his thought between its two eyebrows.
ayaṃ kilāśubhāyāmatikrāntamanaskāro yogācāraḥ /	He is then an ascetic “in whom the act of the visualization of the loathsome has been achieved.”

Therefore there are four alternatives: The ascetic is a master of the act of attention which constitutes visunalization and considers only hisThe ascetic is not a master of the act of attention, but considers the earth as filled with skeletons. The ascetic is not a master of the act of attention and considers his own body. The ascetic is a master of the act of attention and considers the earth as filled with skeletons.

The ten spheres in which the ascetic can be found in order to produce them are the Four Dhyānas, the four sāmantakas, dhyānāntara and Kāmadhātu. Its object is the visibles of the sphere of Kāmadhātu. “Visible” signifies'color and shape.
atha evārthālamvaneti siddham /	This means that it has a “thing” and not a “name” for its object.

“nahaiva gṛhapate satyānāmekābhisamayo 'pi pūrvābhisayaya” iti vistareṇa sadṛṣṭāntāni trīṇi sūtrāṇi /	It is with reference to insight comprehension that the Sūtra teaches the gradual comprehension of the Truths, “Oh householder, comprehension is not unique, but gradual. " and the rest; in all there are three Sūtras accompanied by examples.
“yo duḥkhe niṣkāṅkṣo nirvicikitso buddhe 'pi sa” iti sūtrādekābhisamaya iti cet /  na / asaṃmudācārāvaśyaṃprahāṇābhisaṃdhivacanāt /	But, one would say, the Sūtra says that “one who is free from perplexity and doubt with regard to suffering is also free from perplexity and doubt with regard to the Buddha. ” Therefore comprehension is not gradual, but single and unique. This objection does not hold: for this Sūtra means to say that when suffering is understood, the perplexity and the doubt relative to the Buddha does not become active and will necessarily be abandoned.
ya eṣauktaḥ ṣoḍhaśacittako 'bhisamayaḥ so 'gradharmaikabhūmikaḥ //	We have seen that comprehension consists of sixteen mental.
yadbhūmiko 'gradharmastadbhūmikānyetāni ṣoḍaśa cittāni /	These sixteen mental states are of the same sphere as the Supreme Worldly Dharmas.
ta punaḥ ṣaḍbhūmikā ityuktaṃ prāk /	We have seen that these can be of six spheres.
kasmāt punaḥ kṣāntayo jñānāni cavaśyaṃ bhavanti / yasmāt	Why are there necessarily Patiences and Knowledges?
kṣāntijñānānyanantarya muktimārgā yathākramam /	The Patiences and Knowledges are, in this order, the Irresistible Path and the Path of Deliverance.
anantaryamārgāḥ kṣāntayaḥ kleśaprāptivicchedaṃ pratyantarayitumaśakyatvāt /	The Patiences cannot be hindered in their cutting off of the possession of the defilements; they are therefore, according to Pāṇni, the Irresistible Path.
vimuktimārgāstu jñānāni / kleśaprāptivimuktānāṃ visaṃyogaprāptisahotpādāt / ata ubhayairavaśyaṃ bhavitavyam /	The Knowledges arise among the persons who are thus delivered from the possession of the defilements, at the same time as does possession of disconnection from the defilements: they are therefore the Path of Deliverance.
dvābhyāṃ cauraniṣkāsanakapāṭapidhānavat /	As a consequence there is Patience and Knowledge, in the same way that there are two actions: expelling the thief, and closing the door.
yadi punardvitīyenānantaryamārgeṇaiva saha visaṃyogaprāptirutpadyeta kiṃ syāt / prahīṇavicikitsaṃ jñānaṃ tatraivālambane notpannaṃ syāt /	If the possession of disconnection takes place only with the second Patience or second Irresistible Path.
kṣāntibhiḥ kleśaprahāṇānnava saṃyojananikāyā jñānavadhyā iti śāstravirodha iti cet /	But if the defilements are abandoned by means of the Patiences, is there not a contradiction with the text of the Śāstra, “There are nine categories of bonds”?
na / kṣāntīnāṃ jñānaparivāratvāt /	No, for the Patiences are the attendants of the Knowledges;
rājaparivārakṛtasya rājakṛtavyapadeśavat /	the Śāstra attributes the very same work of the Patiences to the Knowledges, in the way that one says that the king does that which is done by his men.
kiṃ punaḥ sarvāṇi ṣoḍaśacittāni satyadarśanāddarśanamārgaḥ / netyāha / kiṃ tarhi /	From the fact that they all see the Truths, does it follow that the sixteen mental states of comprehension are the Path of Seeing?
adṛṣṭadṛṣṭerdṛṇṭṅmārgastatra pañcadaśa kṣaṇāḥ //	Because they are produced within anyone who sees that which has not been seen, fifteen moments are the Path of Seeing.
duḥkhadharmajñānakṣāntimārabhya yāvat mārge 'nvayajñāna kṣāntirete pañcadaśa kṣāṇā darśanamārgaḥ / ki kāraṇam /	Fifteen moments, from the Patience that has the Dharma Knowledge of Suffering for its object to the Patience of Consecutive Knowledge that has the Path for its object, constitute the Path.
adṛṣṭasatyadarśanāt / ṣoḍaśe tu nāstyapoūrvaṃ dravyamiti /	In the sixteenth moment there is nothing more to see which has not been seen.
yathādraṣṭābhyasanādbhāvanāmārga eva /	This moment meditates on the Truth as it has been seen, and so forms part of the Path of Meditation.
nanu ca tenāṣyadṛṣṭaṃ paśyati mārge 'nvayajñānakṣāntim /	But, one would say, the sixteenth moment sees the fifteenth moment, the Patience that has the Consecutive Knowledge of the Path as its object, which has not been seen previously. Without doubt;
satyaṃ prati cintā na kṣaṇam /	but that to which it refers is the knowledge as to whether the Truth has been seen or not, not whether a moment has been seen or not.
na hi kṣaṇenādṛṣṭena satyamadṛṣṭaṃ bhavati / yathā naikena luṅgenālūnena dedāramalūnaṃ bhavati /	The fact that a moment has not been seen does not create the fact that the Truth has not been seen, in the same way that a field is not unharvested because one stalk remains to be cut.
phalatvādaṣṭajñānaṣoḍaśākārabhāvanāt pūrvamārgavihāneḥ pravandhikatvācca mārgānvayajñānaṃ bhāvanāmārgaḥ /	Furthermore, the sixteenth moment, the Consecutive Knowledge of the Path forms part of the Path of Meditation: because it constitutes a result, a Érāmaṇyaphala; because it embraces meditation, the possession or acquisition of the eight Knowledges. Objection: The sixteenth moment should be considered as forming part of the Path of Seeing, because it is certainly free from falling away.
aparihāṇistudarśanaheyakleśaprahāṇasaṃdhāraṇāt / ata eva darśanamārga iti cet / na / atiprasaṅgāt /	And its non-falling away results from the fact that it supports or confirms the abandoning of the defilements abandoned through the Path of Seeing. If you maintain that, for this reason, the sixteenth moment is of the Path of Seeing, this then leads to absurd consequences: the sixteenth moment and the following, and also the seeing of the Truths the second day and following, will be the Path of Seeing, for they also confirm the abandoning of the defilements abandoned through the Path of Seeing.
sapta jñānāni kasmāddarśanamārgaḥ / darśanasyāsamāptatvāt /	How is it that the first seven Knowledges are of the Path of Seeing and not the eighth?
na hi sarvaṃ satyadarśanaṃ samāptamiti tadantarālatvāttanyappi darśanamārgaḥ /	In fact, all eight see what has been seen through the Patience which precedes.

śraddhayānusāraḥ śraddhānusāraḥ / so 'syāstīti śraddhānusārī /	Here the word “faculties” signifies the faculties of faith, absorption, etc. The term Śraddhānusārin is explained etymologically: śraddhayā anusāraḥ = śraddhānusāraḥ, 'pursuit by reason of faith”;
śraddhayānusartuṃ śīlamasyeti vā /	one in whom there is this pursuit, or in whom the habit is to pursue by.
pūrvaṃ parasaṃpratyayenārthānusaraṇāt /	he has pursued the Truth under the impulse of another, through confidence in another.

arhattvaṃ tu na śakyamāditaḥ prāptum / darśanamārgeṇa bhāvanāheyānāmaprahāṇāt / pūrvaṃ ca bhavāgravairāgyāsaṃbhavāt /	The quality of Arhat cannot be acquired directly, that is to say without the state of Anāgāmin first being acquired--,for, on the oṉe hand, the defilements abandoned through meditation cannot be abandoned through the Path of Seeing and, on the other hand, there cannot have been detachment by a worldly path previous to Naivasarṁjfīānāsaṁjñāyatana.
śraddhādhimuktadṛṣṭacyāptau mṛdutokṣṇendriyau tadā //	At this moment, the ascetics with weak and sharp faculties become respectively Śraddhādhimukta or Drṣ̃ṭiprāpta. The ascetic with weak faculties, who was a Śraddhānusārin. The ascetic with sharp faculties, who was a Dharmānusārin, now takes the name of Drṣṭiprāpta.

kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ prahīṇapañcaprakāro 'pi ṣoḍaśe citte srota āpanna evocyate na sakṛdāgāmiphalapratipannakaḥ /	By what reason does the ascetic who has abandoned the first categories of the defilements of Kāmadhātu abandoned through meditation, become, in the sixteenth moment, a SŚrotaāpanna and not a candidate for the state of Sakṛdāgāmin? The same question is posed for the ascetic who has abandoned the sixth, seventh, and eighth categories, and who in the sixteenth moment, becomes a Sakr̥dāgāmin and not a candidate for the state of Anāgāmin;

phale hi labhyamāne phalaviśiṣṭo mārgo na labhyata ityeṣa niyamaḥ /	Upon the acquisition of a result, one does not acquire a path higher than this state, for example, upon the acquisition of Srotaāpanna, one does not obtain the path of Sakrdāgāmin: such is this principle.
ataḥ phalastho yāvanna viśeṣāya prayujyate phalāntaraprāptau tāvat pratipannako nocyate / evamanyatrāpi phale veditavyam /	As a consequence, the abider in a result, as long as he does not exert himself with a view to a higher progress for the acquisition of a new state, that is, as long as he does not cultivate the preparatory exercises which have for their result the abandoning of the defilements not yet abandoned and which is the cause of the acquisition of a new state, this resident is not a candidate for this new state.
yastu tṛtīyadhyānavītarāgo 'dharāṃ bhūmi niśritya niyāmamavakrāmati so 'vaśyaṃ phalaviśiṣṭaṃ mārga saṃmukhīkaroti /	Nevertheless, the ascetic who, detached from the Third Dhyāṇna, enters into niáyāmma or the Path of Seeing in a sphere lower than this Dhyāna is not a candidate for a higher result. certainly realizes a path higher than the result.

ānupūrvikaṃ tu vaktavyam /	We must now study the ascetic who proceeds gradually.
ata idaṃ tāvadvacyavasthāpyate /	To this end, the following point should be established.
yathaite kāmadhātau navaprakārāḥ kleśā upadiṣṭā evaṃ	As the defilements of Kāmadhātu are divided into nine categories.
navaprakārā doṣā hi bhūmau bhūmau	Each sphere has nine categories of vices.

For it is impossible for the strongstrong path to be produced from the very beginning; and it is impossible that there would be a strong-strong defilement when there is a strong-stroṅṇg path. In the same way, when one washes a piece of cloth, the greater stains are washed out first and only lastly the subtle stains;
audārikaṃ ca tamaḥ sūkṣmeṇālokena hanyate sūkṣmaṃ cādhimātreṇetyeṣa dṛṣṭāntayogaḥ /	so too a. Great darkness is vanquished by a small light, whereas a great light is required to get rid of a small amount of darkness. Such are the types of examples that one can supply.

In this same way, the vices of wind, the bile, etc. , accumulated over a long period of time, are gotten rid of by one grain of powder of the rôvṛt root ;
bahukālasaṃvarddhitānāṃ doṣāṇāṃ trivṛtkarṣavat kṣaṇikālpapradīpamahātamopaghātavacya /	so too a great darkness is broken up by a small, momentary light.
evaṃ navaprakāreṣu kleśeṣu sarvatra	There are therefore nine categories of defilements abandoned through meditation.
akṣīṇabhāvanāheyaḥ phalasthaḥ saptakṛtparaḥ /	The abider in a result who has not destroyed that which one should abandon through meditation is a Saptakr̥tṭparamaḥ.
yasya hi phalasthasyaiko 'pi bhāvanāheyaḥ prakāro 'prahīṇaḥ sa srota āpanaḥ /	The abider in a result who has not even abandoned one category of the defilements abandoned through meditation is a.
saptajanmāni karotīti saptakṛta / paraḥ sarvāntyaḥ /	As he can be reborn seven times but no more, he is an “at the most seven times.” As it is not an absolute rule that he will be reborn seven times, one says, “at the most.”
na hi sarvasaptakṛditi / saptakṛtvaḥparama iti sūtrapāṭhaḥ / saptakṛtvaḥ paramaṃ janmā 'syetyarthaḥ /	The expression of the Sūtra, saptakr̥tvaḥ paramaḥ, signifies “there is rebirth for him seven times at the most.”
prakarṣe paramaśabdaḥ /	The word paramab is understood as prakarṣeṇa .
nirvāṇasroto hi mārgastena tatra gamanāt /	Srotaāpanna: the river or stream , the stream of Nirvāṇa, the path, for one goes by means of a stream.
tadasāvāpanna āgataḥ prāpta iti srota āpannaḥ /	The ascetic who has entered into it, who has arrived at it and who has attained it, is called “one who has entered into the stream” .
kathamāpannaḥ /	Objection: How can one enter it?
ādyamārgalābhāccet aṣṭamako 'pi syāt /	Would one say that it is by the obtaining of the first path? Then the eighth saint would be a Srotaāpanna.
ādyaphalalābhāccet bhūyo vītarāgo 'pi syāt /	Would one say that it is by the obtaining of the first state?
kāmavītarāgaḥ / sarvaphalaprāpiṇamadhikṛtyādyaphalalābhāt /	Then the bhūyovīñarāga and the kāmavītarāga, when they acquire the first state which they acquire, would be Srotaāpannas; but you have said that they are, respectively, Sakrṛdāgāmins and Anāgāmiṇs .
kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ sa eva nāṣṭamakaḥ /	We would answer: The ascetic enters into the stream by theBut why is not the eighth saint a Srotaāpanna, for he has entered into the stream of the Noble Path?
pratipannakaphalamārgalābhāt darśanabhāvanāmārgalābhāt sakalasroto 'bhisamayācca mārgānvayajñāne /	Because it is at the sixteenth moment, that of the Consecutive Knowledge of the Path, that one possesses both the path of the candidate, consisting of fifteen moments, and the path of the state, and the Path of Seeing and the Path of Meditation;
sa eva tasmādanyānsaptopapattibhavānmanuṣyeṣu pratisaṃdadhāti saptāntarābhavān /	because then one comprehends the “stream,” that is, the Path in its entirety, up to and including the fifteenth moment. The Vaibhāṣikas say: Independently of the present existence, the Srotaāpanna again takes up birth among humans, seven existences properly so-called, and seven intermediate existences ;
evaṃ deveṣvityaṣṭāviṃśatiyavān pratisaṃdadhāti /	and in this same way, he again takes up biṟth among the gods. That is, he takes up birth up to twenty-eight existences. Yet, as he has everywhere the series of seven.
saptakasāmānyāttu saptakṛtvaḥ / parama uktaḥ /	Existences, the ascetic is said to be "reborn at the most seven times"; the same way that a Bhikṣu is called "wise in seven things" when he knows the "groups of seven";
saptasthānakauśalasaptaparṇavaditi vaibhāṣikāḥ /	so too a tree is termed "having seven leaves" because its buds produce some seven leaves.
yattarhhi sūtra uktaṃ “asthānamanavakāśo yaddaṣṭisaṃpannaḥ pudgalo 'ṣṭamaṃ bhavamabhinirvartayiṣyati / nedaṃ sthānaṃ vidyata” iti /	Objection: But the Sūtra says, "'It is absolutely impossible for a saint possession views to produce an eighth existence.
ekasyāṃ gatāvityabhiprāyaḥ /	" And this text is in contradiction to the doctrine of the Vaibhāṣikas.
yathārutaṃ vā kalpyamāne 'ntarābhavo 'pi na syāt evamapyūredhvasrotaso bhavāgraparamasyaikasyāṃ gatāvaṣṭama upapattibhāvo na prāpnoti / kāmadhātvabhi saṃdhivacanādadoṣaḥ / kimatra jñāpakaṃ sūtraṃ yuktirvā /	No, they answer, for this text should be understood: "He does not produce an eighth existence in the same realm of rebirth.
iha caiva kiṃ jñāpakaṃ pratyekaṃ devamanuṣyeṣu saptakṛtvo na pounarubhayeṣveva saptakṛtva iti / evaṃ hi paṭhacyate / “saptakṛtvo devāśca manuṣyāśce“ti / pratyekamapi tu kāśyapīyāḥ paṭhanti / “saptakṛtvo devān saptakṛtvo manuṣyāni“ti / nātrābhiniveṣṭavyam /	" Or, if one wants to hold to the letter of the Sūtra: "Having transmigrated, having passed seven times both among the gods and among humans, he will realize the end of suffering," one should conclude that the heavenly and human rebirths are not preceded by any intermediate existences, since the Sūtra speaks only of gods and humans.
yaśca manuṣyesu srota āpanno bhavati sa tānevāgamya parinirvāti /	Taking up the objection again, if one should understand: "He does not produce an eighth existence in the same realm of rebirth,"He who becomes a Srotaāpanṇna as a human will return to be among humans in order to obtain Nirvāṇa.
yo deveṣu sa tāneva / kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇamaṣṭamaṃ bhavaṃ nābhinirvartayati /	He who becomes a Srotaāpanna as a god will return to be among the gods in order to obtain Nirvāṇa.
tāvatā kakalenāvaśyaṃ saṃtatiparipākāt /	Because, in this limit of time, in the course of seven existences, his series is necessarily matured.
mārgo hi sa tajjātīyaḥ / saptapadāśīviṣa daṣṭavaccāturthakajvaravacca / saptasaṃyojanāvaśeṣatvācca /	Such is the nature of the Path: so too, such is the nature of the venom of the “seven-footed serpent”” that a person bitten dies after having walked only seven paces; such is the nature of this illness that the four-day fever returns during each of the four days.
dve avarabhāgīye pañca cordhvabhāgīyānīti /	He does not obtain Nirvāṇa in less time because some seven bonds remain, two of the avarabhāgīya or lower class, namely sensual desire and anger, and five of the rdhvabhāgīya or higher class, namely two cravings in Rūpadhātu and Ārūpyadhātu, dissipation, pride, and delusion.
antareṇāpyāryamārgaṃ saṃmukhīkurvāṇo na parinirvāti / tāvat bhavavedanīyasya karmaṇo valādhānāt /	Because, even though he realizes the Noble Path, he does not obtain Nirvāṇa in the interval by reason of the force of the actions which should be rewarded in the course of the seven existences.
asati buddhotpādagrahastha evārhattvaṃ prāpnoti / agāraṃ tu pounarnādhyāvasati /	If a Buddha has not arisen in the period when one should obtain Nirvāṇa, it is as a householder that he will obtain the.

anyāśramikaṃ liṅgenetyapare /	according to other masters, with the marks of a non-Buddhist Bhikṣu.
kasmādavinipātakadharmā bhavati /	Why is the Srotaāpanna declared to be an avinipātadharman, “one incapable of falling into a painful realm of rebirth” ? Because he does not accumulate actions which cause him to fall into it;
tadgāmi karmānupacayādupacitavipākadānavaiguṇyācca saṃtaterbalavatkuśalā dhivāsanātprayogāśayaśuddhitaḥ /	because, by the actions of this type which have already been previously accumulated, his mind has become refractory to the maturation of these actions, being perfumed by the powerful roots of good by reason of the purity of his behavior, and by reason of the purity of his sentiments with regard to the Three Jewels.
apāyanipāte tu karmaṇyasau kṣāntimapi notpādayet / āha cātra	A person who has accumulated an action which should necessarily mature in a painful realm of ṛrebirth cannot even produce Patience , much less the pure Path.
“kṛtvā budho 'lpamapi pāpamadhaḥ prayāti kṛtvā budho mahadapi prajahātyanartham	There is a stanza, “The ignorant, if they have committed only a”The wise, if they have committed a great transgression, avoid painful rebirth.

yasmāt pareṇa duḥkhaṃ nāsti /	Suffering beyond which there is no more suffering.

But there is no fixed principle here: this Prthagjana can obtain Nirvāṇa in this life, or in an intermediate existence, etc. Consequently we do not speak of this here.

indriyatastatpratipakṣānāsravendriyalābhāt /	from the point of view of the ôṉdriyas or moral faculties, through the acquisition of pure faculties opposed to these defilements;

For, from the fact that the Srotaāpanna abandons the defilements after the acquisition of his state, one concludes, without one having to say so, that he acquires the pure faculties opposed to these defilements.
kasmānna pañcaprakāraprahāṇāt /	But the number of rebirths is indicated: in fact, after having acquired the state of Srotaāpanna, the saint is capable ofWhy does the Srotaāpaṇṇa who abandons the fifth category not become a Kulaṁkula?
tatprahāṇe ṣaṣṭhasyāvaśyaṃ prahāṇāt nahi tasyaikaḥ prakāraḥ phalaṃ vighnayituṃ samarthaḥ /	Because, when the fifth category is abandoned, the sixth is also certainly abandoned, and the saint therefore becomes a Sakṛdāgāmiṉn.
ekavīcikasyeva dhātvanatikramāt /	In fact here one category of defilement is not capable of creating an obstacle to the acquisition of a state, as in the case of one who is separated by only one more rebirth from Nirvāa the reason is that here the saint, by acquiring a new state, does not pass into another sphere of existence or Dhātṭu.

kathamasyaikaḥ prakāraḥ phalaṃ vidhnayitum śaknoti /	Why does the only category that remains to him, the ninth, create an obstacle to the acquisition of later states?
dhātvatikramāt /	Because the acquisition of this state involves passage to another sphere to Rūpadhātu.

Nirvāṇa is separated from this saint by one rebirth; the state of Anāgāmin is separated from this saint by one category of defilement: he is therefore termed an Ekavīcika. Having abandoned seven or eight categories of defilements, he is a candidate for the third state.

The first one, who obtains Nirvana in the intermediate existence, is one who obtains Nirvana in an intermediate existence, by attaining it in Rupadhatu.

sābhisaṃskāraṃ parinirvātyabhiyuktāvāhimārgatvāt /	The fourth one, who obtains Nirvāṇa without effort, obtains Nirvāṇa without effort, for he is not energetic, and the Path is not spontaneous. Such are the definitions of these two saints according to the Vaibhāṣikas. According to another opinion, the difference between the third and the fourth is that the former obtains Nirvāṇa by a path having for its object conditioned things, namely suffering, its origin, and the Path;
anabhisaṃskāraparinirvāyī tvaṃnabhisaṃskāreṇābhiyogavāhimārgābhāvāt / saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtālambanamārganirvāṇādityapare /	and the latter, by a path having for its object unconditioned things, namely Extinction or the Third Noble Truth.

atiprasaṅgāt / sūtre tvanābhisaṃskāraparinirvāyī pūrva paṭhacyate /	In the Sūtra, the Anāgāmiṉ who obtains Nirvāṇa without effort is listed before the Anāgāmin who obtains it with effort.

vāhyavāhimārgayoranabhisaṃskārābhisaṃskārasādhyatvādayatnayatnaprāptitaḥ /	But, for the second, the path is realized by gbhisaṅṁskara, being obtained with effort; therefore it is uṇṅspontaūeous.
upapadyaparinirvāyiṇastu vāhitaro 'dhimātrataraśca mārgo mṛdutarāścānuśayā iti /	For the Anāgāmin who obtains Nirvāṇa through birth, the path is even more spontaneous, even stronger, and the latent defilements are even weaker.
ūrdhvasrotā yasyordhvaṃ gatirna tatriva parinirvāṇaṃ yatropapannaḥ /	The fifth, the Ūrdhvasrotas, is the saint "for whom there is srotas, that is to say, ga? ś or movemeṇt, to the height.

As he does not immerse himself in any of the fourteen intermediate heavens between the first heaven of Rūpadhātu and the last one, he is called a Jurnper.

sarvacyuto nāma yaḥ sarvāṇi sthānāntarāṇi saṃcaryākaniṣṭhān praviśati / na ca dakācidanāgāmī /	One who Dies Everywhere transmigrates through all of the other heavens, with the exception of the Mahābrahmas, before he enters into Akaniṣṭha.

The quality of Akaniṣṭhaparama and Bhavāgraparama only imply the non-production of a new existence after the saint has obtained Akaniṣṭha Heaven or Bhavāgra, not a birth in these same heavens;
akaniṣṭhabhavāgraparamatvaṃ tu pareṇa gatyabhāvādyathā sapta kṛtvaḥparamatvaṃ srota āpannasyeti /	the same way that the Srotaāpanna, destined to be reborn at the most seven times, can be reborn less than seven times.

The question is posed whether this Anāgāmin is of the five types, Antarāparinirvāyiṉ, etc. This Āryan, once he has obtained the state of Anāgāmin, obtains Nirvana in this same existence, by reason of the intensity of his disgust at the extreme suffering of Kāmadhātṭu.
rūpadhātau tu parāvṛttajanma kadācidārupyānpraviśati / ya ūrdhvaṃsrotā bhavāgraparamaḥ /	But the Āryan who obtains the state of Anāgāmin after having been reborn in Rūpadhātu, goes sometimes to Ārūpyadhātu as a Bhavāgraparana Ūrdhvasrota.
yattarhi śakreṇoktaṃ “ye te devā akaniṣṭhā iti viśrutāḥ /	Objection: But Śakra expresses himself thus: ''If at the end I should fall, may I be reborn among the well-known gods under the name of Akaniṣṭhas!
ante me hīyamānasya tatropapattirbhaviṣyati” /	” This contradicts your thesis.
abhidharmā nabhijñatvāditi vaibhāṣikāḥ / bhavatā “pyanivāraṇaṃ saṃharṣaṇīyatvā” diti / sa cordhvajaśca naivākṣasaṃcāraparihāṇibhāk //	The Vaibhāṣikas answer: Śakra expresses himself in this way because he does not know the Dharma.
sa ca kāmadhātau parivṛttajanmā ūrdhvadhātūpapannaścāryo naivendriyāṇi saṃcarati nāpi kathañcit parihīyate /	And, if the Blessed One does not correct him, it is with the intention of encouraging him. This Āryan and one who is born in a higher sphere, are incapable of modifying their faculties, and are incapable of falling away. The Āryan who has become an Anāgāmin by being reborn in Kāmadhātu and one who is born in a higher sphere are not even.
kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ parivṛttajanmāntāsyāryasya rūpārupyapraveśendriyasaṃcāraparihāṇayo neṣyante /	Capable of modifying their faculties; how could they fall away? Why not admit a modification of faculties and a falling away in the case of the Āryan who has entered into Rūpadhātu or Ārūpyadhātu?
yasmānna santi /	Because neither a modification of faculties nor a falling away occur in the case of these saints.
kasmānna santi /	Why is this?
janmāntaraparivāsenendriyāṇāṃ paripakvataratvādāśrayaviśeṣalābhācca /	Because, from the fact of their stay in two existences, their faculties have acquired an advanced state of maturity; and because the saint has acquired a personality favorable to the Path.
atha kasmādvītarāgaḥ śaikṣo nāntarāye parinirvāyī bhavati /	Why is not a Śaikṣa not detached from Kāmadhātu, that is a Srotaāpanna and a Sakr̥dāgāmin, an Antarāparinirvāyin? That is, why does he not obtain Nirvāṇa in the intermediate existence which follows his death?
mārgasyājitatvādasaṃmukhībhāvataḥ anuśayānāṃ ca nātimandatvāt duḥsamatikrāmatvātkāmavātoriti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	Since he has not mastered the Path, this saint cannot manifest it; and because these latent defilements are not extremely weak. Such is our answer. The Vaibhāṣikas answer: Because it is very difficult to leave Kāmadhāru.
bahu hyanena kartavyaṃ bhavati / akuśalāmyākṛtakleśaprahāṇaṃ dvitriśrāmaṇyaphalaprāptistridhātusamatikramaśca /	In fact, in order to obtain Nirvāṇa, the Śaikṣaṁ question should do many things: abandon the bad defilements.
taccāntarābhavastho na śaktaḥ kartumiti /	Now a saint, in his intermediate existence, is not capable of doing this.
yaduktaṃ “sa dhyāne vyavakīrṇe 'kaniṣṭhaga” iti /	We have seen that "combining his Dhyānas, he is an Akanisṭha".
atha katamaddhacyānaṃ prathamato vyavakīryate /	What Dhyāna is first combined?
ākīryate caturthaṃ prāk	First, combination of the Fourth Dhyāṇna.
sa hi sarvakarmaṇyaḥ samādhiḥ sukhapratipadāmagracyatvāt /	Because it is the most powerful of the absorptions and the best of the easy paths.
evaṃ ca punaḥ vyavakīryate /	This is how one proceeds.
arhannanāgāmī vā pravāhayuktamanāsravaṃ caturthaṃ dhyānaṃ samāpadyate /	The Arhat or the Anāgāmin enters the Fourth Dhyāna, pure and prolonged, that is, constituting a series of thoughts.
tasmādvacyutthāya pravāhayuktaṃ tadeva sāsravaṃ samāpadyate punaścānāsravam /	He leaves it, and returns to the same Fourth Dhyāna, but impure and prolonged. He continues in this way, diminishing gradually the number of thoughts of each pure, impure, and pure Dhyāna, until, having entered a pure.
evaṃ pravāhāprahāsena yadā kila dvau kṣaṇāvanāsravau samāpadyate dvau sāsravau punaścānāsravāvayaṃ vyavakiraṇasya prayogaḥ /	he leaves it in order to enter an impure Dhyāna of two thoughts, which will be followed by a pure Dhyāna of two thoughts. This constitutes the preparatory stage for the combination.
niṣpatti kṣaṇamiśraṇāt / yadā tvanāsravasya kṣayasyānantaraṃ sāsravaṃ saṃmukhīkaroti sāsravasyānāsravam /	The combination is achieved through the combining of moments.
evaṃ sāsravasya kṣaṇasyānāsravābhyāṃ miśraṇāt vyavakiraṇaṃ niṣpannaṃ bhavatīti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	The Vaibhāṣikas say: When, following a pure thought, an impure thought is called up, and, following this impure thought, a pure thought is called up: then, through the combining of an impure thought and two pure thoughts, the combination of the Dhyāna is achieved.
dvau hi kṣaṇāvānantaryamārgasadṛśau tṛtī yo vimuktimārgasadṛśa iti /	The first two moments are similar to the Irresistible Path, the third to the Path of Deliverance.
evaṃ caturthaṃ dhyānaṃ vyavakīrya tadvalelnānyānyapi vyavakīryante /	Having thus combined the Fourth Dhyāna, by the force of this combined Dhyāna, the saint also combines the other Dhyānas.
kāmadhātau triṣu dvīpeṣu prathamaṃ vyavakīryate /	The combination takes place first in Kāmadhātu;
paścāt parihīṇena rūpadhātau / aśakyaṃ tu kṣaṇavyavakiraṇamanyatra buddhāt /	later, in the case of falling away, the saint combines these in Rūpadhātu. In our opinion, the combination of a single, unique impure moment with two pure moments, is impossible to everyone, with.
ata icchātaḥ pravāhatrayasamāpattito niṣpannaṃ bhavatīti paśyāmaḥ /	Consequently the combination of a Dhyāṇa is achieved when one enters, for the period of time that one wants, into three prolongued Dhyānas, pure, impure, and pure.
kimarthaṃ pounardhyānaṃ vyavakīryate /	To what end does the saint combine his Dhyānas?
upapattivihārārthaṃ kleśabhīrutayā 'pi ca //	With a view to arising, to bliss and also through fear of the defilements.
tribhiḥ kāraṇairdhyānaṃ vyavakiranti / tīkṣṇendriyā anāgāminaḥ śuddhāvāsopapattyarthaṃ dṛṣṭadharmasukhavihārārthaṃ ca /	It is for three reasons that the saint combines his Dhyānas: the Anāgāmin of sharp faculties, with a view to a rebirth among the Śuddhāvāsas and with a view to happiness in this life;
mṛdvindriyāḥ kleśabhirutayā cāsvādanāsaṃprayuktasamādhidūrīkaraṇādaparihīṇārtham /	the Anāgāmin of weak faculties, also through fear of the defilements, so that he may avoid falling away by holding the absorption of disgust at a distance ;
arhantastu tīkṣaṇendriyā dṛṣṭadharmasukhavihārārtham /	the Arhat of sharp faculties, with a view to happiness here below;
mṛdvindriyāḥ kleśabhīrutvāccāparihīṇārtham /	the Arhat of weak faculties, also through fear of the defilements, so that he may avoid falling away.
atha kasmāt pañcaiva śuddhāvāsopapattayaḥ /	Why are there five types of birth among the Śuddhāvāsas?
yadetadvacyavakīrṇabhāvitaṃ caturthaṃ dhyānamuktam	The cultivation of the combination of the Fourth Dhyāna, described above, ʼ 43a-b.
tatpāñcavidhyātpañcaiva śuddhāvāsopapattayaḥ /	As it is fivefold, there are five births or types of.
sā hi vyavakīrṇabhāvanā pañcaprakārā mrdumadhyādhimātrataratamabhedāt /	The cultivation of the combination is fivefold, weak, medium, strong, stronger, and strongest.
prathamāyāṃ trīṇi cittāni saṃmukhīdriyante / anāsravaṃ sāsravamanāsravaṃ ca /	In the weak cultivation, one calls up three thoughts, one pure, one impure, and one pure;
dvitīyāyāṃ ṣaṭ /	in the second cultivation, six thoughts;
tṛtīyāyāṃ nava / caturthyāṃ dvādaśa / pañcamyāṃ pañcadaśa /	In the third, the fourth, and the fifth cultivations, nine, twelve, and fifteen thoughts.
tāsāṃ yathāsaṃkhyaṃ pañca śuddhāvāsāḥ phalam /	The five births are, in this order, the result of these five cultivations.
yattatra sāsravaṃ tadvaśātteṣūpapattiḥ /	They are produced by the force of the impure moments included in these cultivations.
śraddhādīndriyādhikyāt pañcetyapare /	According to others, the five births take place by reason of the predominance of the different faculties: Avṛhas, by the predominance of faith. Akaniṣṭhas by the predominance of prajñā.
nirodhalābhyanāgāmī kāyasākṣī punarmataḥ //	The Anāgāmin who has acquired extinction is considered a Kāyasākṣin.
nirodhalābho 'syāstīti nirodhalābhī /	One who is in possession of the absorption of extinction is called one who has acquired extinction.
yo hi kaścidanāgāmī nirodhasamāpattilābhī sa kāyasākṣītyucyate /	As the Anāgāmin, whichever one he may be, has acquired extinction--as he has, in his body, seen the absence of thought and.
nirvāṇasadṛśasya dharmasya kāyena sākṣātkaraṇāt /	He is called a Kāyasākṣin, a bodily witness.
kathaṃ punaḥ kāyena sākṣātkaroti /	How does he immediately experience by the body alone?
cittābhāvāt kāyāśrayotpatteḥ /	Because, in the absence of thought, this immediate perception takes place dependent on the body.
evaṃ tu bhavitavyam /	But this is how the Sautrāntikas would explain this. When the saint leaves the Absorption of Extinction, from the moment when he thinks, “Oh! This absorption of extinction is calm like Nirvāṇa!
sa hi tasmādvyutthāyāpratilabdhapūrvā savijñānakāṃ kāyaśāntiṃ pratilabhate /	”, he acquires a calmness of his conscious body never previously acquired.
yato 'syaivaṃ bhavati śāntā vata nirodhasamāpattirnirvāṇasadṛśī vata nirodhasamāpattiriti / evamanena tasyāḥ śāntatvaṃ kāyena sākṣatkṛtaṃ bhavati /	In this way, he directly perceives by the body the calmness, and this by two acts of perception: in the first, during the absorption there is the acquisition of a body conforming to the extinction, and in the second, upon leaving the absorption, there is a consciousness which becomes conscious of the state of the body.
prāptijñānasākṣātkriyābhyāṃ pratyakṣīkāro hi sākṣātkriyā /	Perception or experience, sākṣātkriyā, is. There is sākṣātkriyā when one ascertains the calmness of the body which has again become conscious; and, from this ascertaining, it results that this calmness has been acquired while the body was non-conscious.
aṣṭādaśa śaikṣā” ityatra sūtre ki kāraṇaṃ kāyasākṣī noktaḥ / kāraṇābhāvāt /	According to the Sūtra, there are eighteen Śaikṣas. Why is not the Kāyasākṣin mentioned as one of the types of Śaiūkṣa? Because the quality of Kāyasākṣin is not one of the causes of the quality of Śaikṣa.
ki punaḥ kāraṇam /	What are the causes of this second quality?
anāsravāstisraḥ śaikṣāstatphāṃ ca /	They are the three fikṣar, learnings or disciplines, adhisītan, adhicittam, and adhiprajñām, which constitute the Path, and the result of these three Ś²kṣas, namely disconnection.
tadviśeṣeṇa hi śaikṣāṇāṃ vyavasthānam /	It is by reason of the diversity of the fṝkṣas and of their reṣult that one distinguishes the Śaikṣas.
nirodhasamāpattiśca naivaśaikṣānāśikṣā phalam /	Now the Absorption of Extinction is not a skṣa, not being a path of abandoning, nor a result of sṟé5a, not being disconnection.
ato na tadyogācdhaikṣaviśeṣa uktaḥ /	Consequently a saint, merely by virtue of the fact that he possesses the Absorption of Extinction, is not.
eṣa tāvadanāgāmināṃ yathāsthūlaṃ bhedaḥ / sūkṣmaṃ tu bhidyamānāḥ sahasraśo bhidyante /	We have roughly enumerated the Anāgāmins.
antarāparinirvāyiṇastrayo mṛdumadhyādhimātrendriyabhedāt /	The Antarāparinirvāyiṉ is from the point of view of his faculties, of three types, of sharp, medium, and weak faculties.
bhūmibhedāccatvāraḥ /	From the point of view of his sphere, of four types, accordingly as he has for his support a certain Dhyāna.
parihāṇadharmādigotrabhedāt ṣaṭ /	From the point of view of his family, of six types: a Parihāṇadharman, a Cetanādharṟman, a Anurakṣaṇādharman, a Sthitākampya, a Prativedhaṇādharman, and an Akopyadharman.
sthānāntarabhedāt ṣoḍaśa bhūmivairāgyabhedāt ṣaṭtriṃśat /	From the point of view of place, of six types: the places towards which he shall enter as an intermediate being, are the sixteen heavens, from the Brahmakāyikas to the Akaniṣṭhas;
rūpadhatau sakalābandhano yāvaccaturthadhyānāṣṭaprakāravītarāgaḥ / sthānāntaragotravairāgyendriyabhedādvānavatāni pañcaviṃśatiḥ śatāni / kathaṃ kṛtvā /	from the point of view of his detachment from the different spheres, of thirty-six types: the Antarāparinirvāyin can be bound by all the bonds of Rūpadhātu; he can be detached from one category from eight categories of defilements of the First Dhyāna; he can be bound by all the bonds of the Second Dhyāna. We thus have four groups of nine Antarāparinirvāyins. We do not count the saint delivered from the ninth category of defilements of the Fourth Dhyāna, who is bound by all the bonds of Ārūpyadhātu: since this refers to the Antarāparinirvāyin, and so to an Anāgāmin "who goes to Rūpadhātu," since intermediate existence does not exist above Rūpadhātu. Therefore, by taking into consideration the different distinctions of place, gotras, detachment, and faculties, one obtains the.
ekasmin sthāne ṣaṭ gotrāṇi /	For each place, there are six gotras.
gotre gotre nava pudgalāḥ sakalabandhano yāvadaṣṭaprakāravītarāgaḥ svasmātsthānāt ṣaṇṇṇavakāni catuṣpañcāśat ṣoḍaśa catuṣpañcāśatkāni catuḥṣaṣṭānyaṣṭau śatāni /	For each of these gotras, there are nine saints: one who is bound by all the bonds and one who is detached from the bonds with respect to the eight categories of defilements: this makes six groups of nines, or fifty-four. If one multiplies this number by the number of places, that is, by sixteen, then we have eight hundred and sixty-four. By taking into consideration the difference in their faculties, that is, three times eight hundred and sixty-four, we then have two thousand five hundred and ninety-two.
indriyabhedāt punastriguṇā ityevaṃ kṛtvā yo 'dharadhyāne navaprakāravītarāgaḥ sa uttare sakalabandhana uktaḥ / samagaṇanārtham /	With a view to obtaining a uniform distribution of nine saints through Dhyāna, the saint who is detached from the ninth category of a lower Dhyāna is considered to be bound by all the bonds of a higher Dhyāna. As for the Antarāparinirvāyin, so too for the others, the Upapadyaparinirvāyin and the Ūrdhvasrotas.
yathāntarāparinirvāyiṇa evaṃ yavadūrdhvasrotasa ityabhisamasya sarve catvāriṃśadūnāni trayodaśasahasrāpyanāgāmināṃ bhavanti /	We have therefore, for the Anāgāmins who go to Rūpadhātu, five times two thousand five hundred and ninety-two for a total of twelve thousand. In this same way one could calculate the number of types of Anāgāmins who go to Ārūpyadhātu.
ābhavāgrāṣṭabhāgakṣidarhattve pratipakṣakaḥ /	Up to the moment when he destroys the eighth part of Bhavāgra, he is a candidate for the quality of Arhat.
anāgāmītyadhikṛtam /	We are speaking of the Anāgāmin.
sa khalvayamanāgāmī prathamadhyānaikaprakāravairāgyāt prabṛti yāvat bhavāgrāṣṭaprakāraprahāṇādarhattvapratipannako bhavanti /	From the moment when he is detached from the first category of the defilements of the First Dhyāna, up to the moment when he abandons the eighth category of the defilements of Bhavāgra, the Anāgāmin is a candidate for the state of Arhat.
navamasyāpyānantaryapathe	Also in the ninth path of abandoning.
navamasyāpi bhāvāgrikasya prakārasya prahāṇāyānantaryamārge so 'rhattvapratipannaka eva /	In the path of abandoning which brings about the abandoning of the ninth category of defilements of Bhavāgra, he is again a candidate for the state of Arhat.
vajropamaśca saḥ //	This path is similar to a diamond.
sa cānantaryamārgo vajropamaḥ samādhirityucyeta / sarvānuśayabheditvāt /	This ninth path, which breaks all of the latent defilements is called the absorption similar to a diamond.
bhinnatvādasau na punaḥ sarvān bhinatti / sarvāstu bhettuṃ samarthaḥ / sarvānantaryamārgāṇāmadhimātratamatvāt /	In truth, it does not break all of the latent defilements because many are already broken: but it has the power to break all of them, being the most powerful of all the paths of.
vajropamānāṃ tu bahubhedaṃ varṇayanti /	There are many types of Vajropamasamādhi. The ascetic can produce it by entering into the different states of absorption in any one of the nine stages, anāgamya, dhyānāntara, the Four Dhyāṇnas, or three Ārūpyas.
anāgāmyasaṃgṛhītā bhāvāgrikaduḥkhasamudāyālambanairduḥkhasamudayānvayajñānākāraiḥ saṃprayuktā aṣṭau /	Produced in anāgamya, there are eight Vajropamasamādhis associated with each of the four aspects of the Consecutive Knowledge of suffering and with each of the four aspects of the Consecutive Knowledge of origin, these Consecutive Knowledges bearing respectively on suffering and origin in Bhavāgra.
nirodhamārgadharmajñānākāraiḥ saṃprayuktā aṣṭau /	Eight Vajropamasamādhis are associated with each of the four aspects of the Dharma Knowledge of extinction, and with each of the four aspects of the Dharma Knowledge of the Path.
nirodhānvayajñānākāraiḥ saṃprayuktāḥ prathamadhyānanirodhālambanāścatvāraḥ /	Four Vajropamasamādhis associated with each of the four aspects of the Consecutive Knowledge of Extinction bear on the First Dhyāna;
evaṃ yāvat bhavāgranirodhālambanāścatvāraḥ /	and so on until: four Vajropamasamādhis associated with each of the four aspects of the Consecutive Knowledge of Extinction bear on Bhavāgra.
mārgānvayajñānākāraiḥ saṃprayuktāścatvāraḥ / kṛtsnasyānvayajñānapakṣasyālambanāt /	Four Vajropamasamādhis are associated with each of the four.
ta ime jñānākārālambanabhedabhinnā dvāpañcāśadvajropamā bhavanti /	We have therefore, in the sphere of Vajropamasamādhis by reason of the distinction of the aspects and the objects of the Knowledges and the Consecutive Knowledges.
yathā 'nāgāmyasaṃgṛhītā evaṃ yāvaccaturthadhyānasaṃgṛhītāḥ /	The same calculation holds with respect to the Vajropamasamādhis produced in the other spheres up to and including the Fourth Dhyāṇṉa.
ākāśavijñānānantyākiñcanyāyatanasaṃgṛhītā yathāsaṃkhyamaṣṭāviṃśatiścaturviṃśativiṃśatiśca bhavanti /	For the Vajropamasamādhis produced in the first three Arūpyas, we have, in this order, twenty-eight, twenty-four, and twenty.
teṣu dharmajñānasyādhobhūminirodhālambanasya cānvayajñānasyābhāvāt /	Dharma Knowledge is absent there. The Consecutive Knowledge having the extinction of a lower sphere for its object is also absent there.
adhobhūmipratipakṣālambanaṃ tu bhavati / tasyānyo 'nyahetutvāditi /	The Consecutive Knowledge exists there having for its object the Path which is opposed to a lower sphere, by reason of the quality of cause which the paths have among themselves.

punargotrendriyabhedāt bhūyāṃso bhavanti /	By taking into consideration the families and the faculties, we obtain even higher figures.
yastvasau bhāvāgriko navamaḥ prakāra ukto yasya vajropamena prahāṇaṃ	We have seen that the ninth category of Bhavāgra is abandoned by Vajropamasamādhi.
tatkṣayāptyā kṣayajñānaṃ	With the acquisition of the destruction of this category, there is the knowledge of destruction.
tasya punarnavamasya prakārasya saha kṣayaprāptyā kṣayajñānamutpadyate /	At the moment when the saint acquires the destruction of the ninth category, there arises the knowledge of destruction.
vajropamasamādheranantaraṃ paścimo vimuktimārgaḥ /	Immediately after Vajropamasamādhi, the last path of abandoning, there arises the last Path of Deliverance.
ata eva tatkṣayajñānaṃ sarvāsravakṣayaprāptisahajatvātprathamataḥ / aśaikṣo 'rhannasau tadā /	This is why this Path of Deliverance, arising at the same time as the acquisition of the destruction of all the vices.
utpanne ca punaḥ kṣayajñāne so 'rhattvapratipannakaḥ aśaikṣo bhavatyarhaścārhattvaphalaprāptaḥ /	When this knowledge has arisen, the candidate for the quality of Arhat has acquired the state of Aśaikṣa, the state of Arhat: he no longer has to apply himself with a view to another state;
phalāntaraṃ prati punaḥ śikṣitavyābhāvādaśaikṣaḥ /	he is therefore an Aśaikṣa. For the same reason, having achieved his task with respect to himself, he is worthy to do good for others; he is worthy to receive offerings from all beings who are still subject to desire.
ata eva sa paramārtaṃ karaṇārthatvāt sarvasarāgapūjārhattvāccārhanniti siddhaṃ bhavatyanye sapta pūrvoktāḥ pudgalāḥ śaikṣā iti /	From the fact that one defines an Arhat as an Aśaikṣa, it results that the seven other saints, four candidates and three abiders, are Śaikṣas.
kena te śaikṣāḥ /	Why are they Śaikṣas? Because it is their nature to be always applying themselves to the three with a view to the destruction of their vices.
āsravakṣayāya nityaṃ śikṣaṇaśīlatvācchikṣātraye adhiśīlamadhicittamadhiprajñaṃ ca / tāḥ punaḥ śīlasamādhiprajñāsvabhāvāḥ /	These three sñéṣās, namely adhisīam ikṣa, adhicistam fikṣā, and adhiprajñām śikṣā, are by theirNature morality, absorption, and speculative knowledge.
pṛthagjano 'pi śaikṣaḥ prāpnoti / na /	But, according to this definition, can a Pṛthagjana be a Śaikṣa?
yathābhūtaṃ satyāprajñānāt punaścāpaśikṣaṇāt /	No, because he does not exactly discern the Truths; and because he is susceptible to completely losing the fiṣās that he has acquired.
ata eva dvirabhidhānaṃ sūtre “śikṣāyāṃ śikṣate śikṣāyāṃ śikṣata iti śivakatasmācchaikṣa ityucyata” iti / yaḥ śikṣata eva nāpaśikṣate sa śaikṣa ityavadhāraṇaṃ yathā vijñāyeta /	This is why, with a view to affirming that he who exclusively applies himself is a Śaikṣa, and to deny that he who abandons the fikṣā īs a Śaikṣa, the Sūtra repeats, "Oh Śīvaka, he who applies himself to that to which he should apply himself, him alone do I call a Śaikṣa.
prakṛtistha āryaḥ kathaṃ śikṣaṇaśīlaḥ /	" But how can one say that the Āryan, when he finds himself in a normal state and not in absorption, has it for his nature to apply himself?
āśayataḥ /	By reason of his intention;
sthitādhvagavat prāptyanuṣaṅgataśca ṣikṣātrayasya /	as the traveller who stops for a moment is nevertheless still a traveller. Or because the possessions of morality, absorption and prajñā, remain attached to him even when he is in a normal state.
atha śaikṣā dharmāḥ katame / śaikṣasyānāsravāḥ / aśaikṣāḥ katame /	What are the dharmas that are called Śaikṣa?
aśaikṣasyānāsravāḥ /	The pure conditioned dharmas of the Śaikṣa. So too the.
nirvāṇaṃ kasmānna śaikṣam /	Why is not Nirvāṇa, the unconditioned, a faṣa?
aśaikṣapṛthagjanayorapi tadyogāt /	Because both the Aśaikṣa and the Pr̥thagjana are endowed with it. The Prṛthagjana is endowed with a Nirvāṇa obtained through a worldly path.
kasmānnāśaikṣam /	Why is not Nirvāṇa aśaikṣa?
śaikṣapṛthagjanayorapi tadyogāt / ta ete sarva evāṣṭāvāryapudgalā bhavanti /	Because both the Śaikṣa and the Pṛthagjana are endowed with it.

prathamaḥ pratipannakaścatvāraśca phalasthāḥ /	Eight in considering their names, but in fact, only five, namely the first candidate, that is to say, the person who is in the Path of the Seeing of the Truths, and the four abiders.
śeṣāṇāṃ pratipannakānāṃ triphalasthāvyatirekāt /	In fact, the last three candidates are confused with the first three abiders. This should be understood of the case in which the ascetic obtains the four states in sequential order. In fact, the bhāyovātarāga and the kāmavītarāga, who have respectively abandoned six.
anupūrvādhigamaṃ pratyevamucyate / bhūyaḥkāmavītarāgau tu syātāṃ darśanamārge sakudāgāmyanāgāmiphalapratipannakau na ca srota āpanna sakṛdāgāmināviti /	Here the candidate for a higher state is not confused with the abider in a lower state.
dvividho hi bhāvanāmārga ukto laukiko lokottaraśceti /	We have said that the Path of Meditation is of two types, worldly or impure, transworldly or pure.
kenāyaṃ śaikṣaṃḥ kuto vairāgyaṃ prāpnoti /	Through what type of Path of Meditation does the Śaikṣa detach himself from the different spheres?
lokottareṇa vairāgyaṃ bhavāgrāt	Detachment from Bhavāgra is through the transworldly path.

ki kāraṇam /	In fact, there is no worldly path higher than Bhavāgra.
tata ūrdhva laukikābhāvāt svabhūmikasya vā pratipakṣatvāt /	The worldly path of a certain sphere cannot be opposed to this same sphere, because the defilements of this sphere attach themselves to this path.
kasmānna pratipakṣaḥ / tatkleśānuśayitatvāt /	Since it is a given that one defilement attached itself to a path, this defilement cannot be expelled by this same path. And since it is.
yo hi kleśo yatra vastunyanuśete na tasya tadvastu oprahāṇāya saṃvartate yasya ca yaḥ pratipakṣo na tatra sa kleśo 'nuśete iti /	A given also that a path is opposed to a defilement, it is certain that this defilement does not attach itself to this path.
anyato dvidhā //	There is detachment from the other spheres in two ways.
bhavāgrādanyataḥ sarvato bhūmelaukikenāopi vairāgyaṃ lokottareṇāpi / tatra punaḥ	One detaches oneself from the eight other spheres, with the exception of Bhavāgra, either through the worldly path or through the transworldly path.
laukikenāryavairāgye visaṃyogāptayo dvidhā /	For the Āryan who detaches himself through the worldly path, his acquisitions of the disconnections are of two types.
laukikena mārgeṇāryavairāgyaṃ gacchato dvividhā visaṃyogaprāptaya utpadyante laukikyo lokottarāśca / lokottareṇa cetyeke	The Āryan who detaches himself from the first eight spheres obtains disconnection from the defilements of these spheres through the worldly path; in other words, he acquires the prāpri or possession of the pratisaṁkhyānirodha of these defilements.
lokottareṇāpyevamityapare / kiṃ kāraṇam /	This possession is worldly and transworldly. According to other masters, he becomes detached through the transworldly path, in the same way. Some other masters say that in the case also where the Āryan becomes detached through the transworldly path, his acquisition of disconṉnection is twofold.
tyavate kleśāsamanvayāt //	For even when pure disconnection is lost, the Aryan is not filled with the defilements.
yadi hyāryamārgeṇa vairāgyaṃ prāpnuvato laukikī visaṃyogaprāpotirnotpadyate evaṃ	Let us admit an instance, when the Aryan becomes detached through the transworldly or Aryan Path, he then does not have worldly possession of disconnection.

This Aryan by the fact that he abandons the paths previously acquired, by the fact that he only possesses the path of the state of Anagamin, in relation to his sharp faculties will no longer be in possession of disconnection from the defilements of Arupyadhatu and having lost this disconnection, he will be filled with these defilements.
tyakte ca tasmin taiḥ kleśaiḥ samanvāgataḥ syāditi / bhavāgrādhavimuktordhvajātavattvasamanvayaḥ /	But if he is not filled with these defilements, he is like a saint half delivered from Bhavagra, like a person who is reborn above.

Let us suppose that this saint, sharpening his faculties in a Dhyāna, abandons the transworldly acquisition of disconnection from these defilements of Bhavāgra: you yourself recognize, nevertheless, that he is not filled with these defilements.
yathā ca pṛthagjanasya prathamadhyānabhūmerurdhvaṃ jātasya kāmāvacarakleśavisaṃyogaprāptityāgānna punastaiḥ samanvāgamo bhavatītyajñāpakametat	So too, a Prṛthagjana is born above the First Dhyāna, in the Second Dhyāṇa, etc. By the fact that he passes into the Second Dhyāṇna, he loses the acquisition of disconnection from the defilements of Kāmadhātu; nevertheless you admit that he is not filled with these defilements.
katapayā punarbhūmyā kuto vairāgyaṃ bhavati /	By means of what spheres does one obtain detachment from the different spheres?
anāsraveṇa vairāgyamanāgāmyena sarvataḥ // ābhavāgrāt /	One becomes detached from all the spheres by means.
atha yaḥ sāmantakaṃ niśrityādharabhūmivairāgyaṃ prāpnoti kimasyānantaryamāgavatsarve vimuktimārgāḥ sāmantakādbhavanti / netyāha /	When the ascetic becomes detached from a lower sphere in a sāmauntaka, should one admit that all of the Paths of Deliverance arise from the sāmantaka, as is the case for the Irresistible Paths?
kiṃ tarhi /	Why is this?
dhyānātsāmantakādvā 'ntyo mukti mārgastribhūjaye /	At the detachment from the Three Dhātus, the last Path of Deliverance arises either from the Dhyāṇa, or from a sāmanmtaka.
nava hyapapattibhūmayaḥ / sarvakāmadhāturaṣṭau ca dhyānārupyāḥ /	There are nine spheres of arising: Kāmadhātu, the Four Dhyānas and the Four Ārūpyas.
tatra yāvat dvitīyadhyānavairāgyaṃ tribhūmijayaḥ / tasmin paścimo vimuktimārgaḥ sāmantakādbhavati dhyānādvā maulāt /	When one triumphs over the Three Dhātus, that is, when one becomes detached from Kāmadhātu, from the First Dhyāṇna, or from the Second Dhyāṇna, it is with a ninth Path of Deliverance which arises either from a sāmantaka or from the Dhyāṇna itself.
nordhvaṃ sāmantakāt	Above, it does not arise from a sāmantaka.
tribhūmijayādūrdhvaṃ maulādeva na punaḥ sāmantakādupekṣendriyasāmānyāt /	With respect to the higher spheres, the last Path of Deliverance always arises from the fundamental absorption, never from the preliminary stage or threshold of this absorption.
triṣu hi dhyāneṣu sāmantakamaulayorindriyabhedāt kaścinna śaknoti maulaṃ dhyānaṃ praveṣṭum /	In fact, after the Fourth Dhyāṇna, the fundamental absorption. The preliminary absorption has the same sensation, the sensation of indifference.
indriyasaṃcārasya duṣkaratvāt /	In the spheres of the first Dhyānas, the two sensations differ: ascetics with weak faculties are not capable of entering, in the ninth Path of Deliverance, the fundamental absorption, for the transformation of their sensation is difficult.
atastribhūmivairāgye dhyānasāmantakādapyanyo vimuktimārgo bhavati /	Therefore the ninth Path of Deliverance of detachment from the first three spheres arises from preliminary absorption.
“anāsraveṇa vairāgyamanāgamyena sarvata” ityuktamanyaistu noktam / ata ucyate	We have seen that the ascetic can detach himself from all the spheres through the pure paths practiced in enāgamya. It is not said that the same power belongs to the pure paths cultivated in spheres other than anāgamya.
āryairaṣṭābhiḥ svordhvabhūjayaḥ //	Through the eight pure paths, he triumphs over his sphere, and over a higher sphere.
anāsravairaṣṭābhirdhyānadhyānāntarārupyaiḥ svasyā ūrdhvāyāśca bhūmervairāgyaṃ nādharāyā vītarāgatvāt /	Through the pure path cultivated in eight spheres, the Dhyānas, dhyānāntara, and three Ārūpyas, the ascetic detaches himself from the sphere in which he finds himself and from higher spheres; but not from a lower sphere because he is already.

vimuktimārgā uttarāṃ bhūmiṃ śāntataḥ praṇītato niḥsarṇataścākārayanti saṃbhavataḥ /	They have for their objects the higher sphere, and the lower sphere. The paths of deliverance can see the higher spheres as calm, excellent, and as definitive liberation.
ānantaryamārgā adharāṃ bhūmimaudārikato duḥkhilataḥ sthūlabhittikataśca / aśāntatvādaudarikato mahābhisaṃskārataratvāt /	The paths of abandoning see the lower spheres as coarse, bad, as a thick wall: as coarse, because it is not calm, entailing a great effort;
apraṇītatvāt duḥkhilato bahudauṣṭhulyataratvena pratikūlabhāvāt / sthūlabhittikatastayaiva tadbhūmyaniḥsaraṇāt bhittyaniḥsaraṇavat /	as bad, because it is not excellent, because it is odious as well as presenting the greatest incapacity to.

na tvanutpādajñānaṃ parihāṇisaṃbhavāt /	but not the Knowledge of Non-Arising.
kiṃ punarakopoyadharmaṇaḥ sā naivotpadyate /	Is this to say that the Immovable Arhat does not possess the Views of the Aśaikṣa?
sarvasya sā 'rhataḥ //	These Views belong to all the Arhats.

yānyetāni catvāri phalānyuktāni kasyaitāni phalāni /	We have spoken of the four states or results. Of what are they the results?
śramaṇyaphalāni /	They are the results of śrāmaṇya or “the religious life.”
kimidaṃ śrāmaṇyaṃ nāma /	What is śrāmaṇya?
śrāvaṇyamamalo mārgaṃḥ	Śrāmaṇya is the immaculate path.
anāsravo mārgaḥ śramaṇyam /	Śrāmaṇya is the pure path.
tena hhi śramaṇo bhavati / kleśasaṃśamanāt /	By this path, by śrāmaṇya, one becomes a Śramaṇa, that is to say a person who calms or who makes cease the defilements.
“śamitā anena bhavanti anekavidhāḥ ṣāpakā akuśalā dharmā vistareṇa yāvajjarāmaraṇīyāstasmācchramaṇa ityucyata” iti sūtre vacanāt /	Therefore it is said in the Sūtra, “He is called a Śramaṇa because he calms all of the types of dhatrmas of transgression, bad, favorable to transmigration, producing rebirth, old age and death.”
anatyantaśamanānna pṛthagjanaḥ paramārthaśramaṇaḥ / tasya punaḥ śrāmaṇyasya /	The Prthagjana is not a true Śramaṇa because he does not calm the defilements in an absolute manner.

saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtāni hi śrāmaṇyaphalāni punaścatvāryuktāni sūtre / api tu	The results of frāmaṇya are conditioned and unconditioned dharmas. The Sūtra says that these results are four in number.
ekānnanavatistāni	On the other hand, there are eighty-nine.
kāni punastāni	What are these eighty-nine?
muktimārgāḥ saha kṣayaiḥ //	The paths of deliverance with their destructions.

We have eighty-one Irresistible Paths for the abandoning of the defilements abandoned through meditation, namely nine paths through which one abandons the nine categories of defilements of each of the nine spheres, and also as many for the Paths of Deliverance. The eighty-nine Irresistible Paths constitute frāmaṇya.
tatrānantaryamārgāḥ śrāmaṇyaṃ vimuktimārgāḥ saṃskṛtāni śrāmaṇyaphalāni / tanniṣyandapuruṣakāraphalatvāt /	The eighty-nine Paths of Deliverance are the conditioned results of frāmaṇya, being outflowing results and virile results of śrāmaṇya.
teṣāṃ kleśānāṃ prahāṇānyasaṃskṛtāni śrāmaṇyaphalāni /	The abandoning or pratisaṁkhyanirodha of the eighty-nine categories of defilements is the unconditioned result of frāmaṇya.

yasyāṃ hi prahāṇamārgāvasthāyāṃ pañca kāraṇāni saṃbhavanti tasyāṃ kia bhagavatā phalaṃ vyavasthāpitam /	The Blessed One defined as results the stages of the path of abandoning in which some five causes are encountered. Such is the opinion of the School.
katamāni pañca /	What are these five causes?
pūrvatyāgo 'nyamārgāptiḥ kṣayasaṃkalanaṃ phale // jñānāṣṭakasya lābho 'tha ṣoḍaśākārabhāvanā /	In a result, there is the abandoning of a previous path, the acquisition of another path, the addition of destructions, the acquisition of a group of eight knowledges, and the acquisition of sixteen aspects.
pūrvamārgatyāgo 'pūrvamārgāptiḥ pratipannakaphalamārgatyāgalābhāt /	That is to say: there is the abandoning of the path of the candidate, and the acquisition of the path of the result;
prahāṇasaṃkalanaṃ sarvasyaikaprāptilābhāt /	the acquisition of a single possession of abandoning in its entirety;
yugapadaṣṭajñānalābhaścaturvidhanāṃ dharmānvayajñānānām /	the acquisition at one and the same time of eight Knowledges, the fourfold Dharma Knowledge, and the fourfold.

yadyanāsravo mārgaḥ śrāmaṇyaṃ kathaṃ laukikamārgaprāptaṃ phaladvayaṃ śrāmaṇyaphalaṃ yujyate /	But if only the pure path receives the name of frāmaṃya, how can the two states, those of Śakr̥dāgāmin and Anāgāmin, when they are obtained by a worldly path, be the results of frāmaṇya?
laukikāoptaṃ tu miśratvānāsravāptiḥ dhṛteḥ phalalm //	obtained by a worldly path is a result, because it is combined, and because it is supported by pure possession.
na hi tatra laukikamārgaphalamev prahāṇaṃ sakṛdāgāmiphalaṃ vā bhavatyanāgāmiphalaṃ vā /	The state of Sakr̥dāgāmin and the state of Anāgāmin, even if they were acquired by a worldly path, are not only abandonings resulting from a worldly Path of Meditation: in fact, they also include an abandoning result of the Path of Seeing; this second abandoning is not separable from the first abandoning;
kiṃ tarhi / darśanamārgaphalamapi prahāṇaṃ tatra miśrīkriyate / sarvasya tatphalasaṃgṛhītaikavisaṃyogaprāptilābhāt /	for there is inherent in the results of Sakr̥dāgāmin and Anāgāmin the single possession of abandoning in its entirety, on the one hand, of defilements abandoned by Seeing, and on the other hand, of defilements abandoned by the worldly Path of Meditation.
ata eva hi sūtra uktaṃ “sakṛdāgāmiphalaṃ katamat /	This is why the Sutra says, "What is the result of Sakrdāgāmin?
yattrayāṇāṃ saṃyojanānāṃ prahāṇaṃ rāgadveṣamohānāṃ ca tatutvamiti /	The abandoning of the three bonds--which are abandoned through Seeing--and the reduction of lust, anger, and delusion.

anāsravayā ca visaṃyogāprāptyā tatprahāṇaṃ sadhāryate / tadvalena parihīṇāmaraṇāt / ato 'pyasya maraṇaṃ yuktaṃ śrāmaṇyaphalam /	" Furthermore, the abandoning which results from the worldly path is supported, confirmed by the pure possession of disconnection, as it results from the fact that, by virtue of this pure possession, the Sakṛ̥dāgāmin and the Anāgāmin cannot die in a state of falling away: they can lose their qualities, but they take them up again before dying.
yadeva caitacchrāmaṇyayuktaṃ /	Śrāmaṇya or the religious life is brāhmaṇya;
brāhmaṇyaṃ brahmacakraṃ ca tadeva	it is brahmacakra.
kleśānāṃ vāhanādvāhmaṇyaṃ brahmacakraṃ tu	It is brahmacakra because it expels the defilements;
brahmāvartanāt /	it is brahmacakra, the Wheel of Brahmā, because it is set into motion by Brahmā.
anuttarabrahmaṇyayogāt bhagavānbrahmā /	The Blessed One, possessing supreme ōrāhḥmaṇya, is Brahmā.
“eṣa hi bhagavān brahmā ityapi śāntaḥ śītībhūta ityapī“ti sūtrāt /	It says that the Blessed One is calm and pacified. This caéra belongs to him;
tasyedaṃ cakramiti brāhmaṃ tena prartitatvāt /	this caekra is therefore of Brahmā, because he sets it into motion.
dharmacakraṃ tu dṛṅmārgaḥ	The Wheel of the Dharma is the Path of Seeing.
caṅkramaṇāccakraṃ tatsādharmyāddarśanamārgo dharmacakram /	It is termed wheel, cakra, because it moves. The Path of Seeing, being of the nature of a wheel (a Jewel of a Wheel, cakraratna), is called the Wheel of the Dharma.
kathamasya sādharmyam /	How is the Path of Seeing of the nature of a wheel?
āśugatvādyarādibhiḥ //	Because it goes quickly, etc. ; because it has spokes, etc. Because it goes quickly, for it comprehends the Truths in fifteen moments of thought; because it leaves one spot and occupies another, leaving the Irresistible Path and occupying the Path of Deliverance;
āśugatvāttyajanakramaṇāt ajitajayajitādhyavasanādutpatananipattanācca /	because it subdues the unsubdued and rules over those subdued, triumphing over the defilements through the Irresistible Path by cutting off the possession of these defilements; ruḻing over the vanquished defilements by the Path of Deliverance. By obtaining possession of disconnection from these defilements; because it rises and descends, either because it is alternatively the Irresistible Path and the Path of Deliverance, or because it successively takes as its object Kāmadhātu and the higher spheres.
evamāśugatvādibhiḥ arādibhiḥ sādharmyādāryāṣṭāṅṅgo mārgaścakramiti bhadantaghoṣakaḥ /	The Bhadanta Ghoṣaka says: The Noble Eightfold Path is a wheel, because its parts are in the nature of spokes, etc. Right Views, Right Thought, Right Effort, and Right Mindfulness are similar to spokes;
samyagdṛṣṭisaṃkalpavyāyāmasmṛtayo hyarasthānīyāḥ /	Right Speech, Right Actions, and Right Livelihood are similar to the axle;
samyagvākkarmāntājīvā nābhisthānīyāḥ samādhirnemisthānīya iti darśanamārgo dharmacakramiti /	and Right Concentration is similar to the rim. On what rests the doctrine that the Wheel of the Dharma is the Path of Seeing the Truths?
kuta etat āryakauṇḍinyasya tadutpattau “pravarttitaṃ dharmacakrami“ti vacanāt /	On the Āgama which says that, at the moment when this Path arose within the Āryan Kauṇḍinya, declared that the Wheel of the Dharma had been set into motion.
kathaṃ tattriparivartaṃ dvādaśākāraṃ ca /	How is this Path of threefold revolution and of twelve aspects?
idaṃ duḥkhamāryasatyam /	The Vaibhāṣikas say: The three revolutions are “this is the Noble Truth of Suffering”;
tat khalu parijñeyaṃ tat khalu parijñātamityete trayaḥ parivartāḥ /	“It should be perfectly known”.
ekaikasmiṃśca parivarte cakṣurudapādi jñānaṃ vidyā buddhirudapādi ityete dvādaśākārāḥ /	At each revolution there arises sight, knowledge, knowing, and intelligence. Thus we have twelve aspects.
pratisatyemevaṃ bhavanti / trikadvādaśakasādharmyāttu triparivartaṃ dvādaśākāramuktam /	The same holds true for the other Truths: "This is the Origin of Suffering," etc. Since the revolutions and the aspects are the same for each Truth, the Wheel of the Dharma is of three revolutions and twelve aspects; not of twelve revolutions and forty-eight aspects.
dvayasaptasthānakauśalādeśanāvat /	So too "the teaching of two things" is the teaching of a great number of things which go by twos; in the same way a person "skillful in seven things," is skillful in a great number of seven things.
ebhiśca parivartairdarśanabhāvanāśaikṣamārgā yathāsaṃkhyaṃ darśatā iti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	The three revolutions correspond, in this order, to the Path of Seeing, the Path of Meditation, and the Path of the Arhat or Aśaikṣa. Such is the explanation of the Vaibhāṣīkas (Vibhāṣa, TD 27, p.
yadyevaṃ na tarhi darśanamārga eva triparivartto dvādaśākāra iti kathamasau dharmacakraṃ vyavasthāpyate /	But if this is the case, then the Path of Seeing would not have three revolutions and twelve aspects. Therefore how would the Wheel of the Dharma be the Path of Seeing? Consequently one.
tasmātsa eva dharmaparyāyo dharmacakraṃ triparirtaṃ dvādaśākāraṃ ca yujyate / kathaṃ ca punastriparivartam /	should understand that the Wheel of the Dharma is this sermon itself, the Sermon of Benares, which sets into motion the Wheel of the Dharma, which includes three revolutions and twelve aspects: three revolutions, because it causes the Truths to be turned some three times;
satyānāṃ triḥ parivarttanāt / kathaṃ dvādaśākāram / caturṇāṃ satyānāṃ tridhākaraṇāt / duḥkhaṃ samudayo nirodho mārga iti /	and twelve aspects, because it considers each Truth under a threefold aspect.
parijñeyaṃ praheyaṃ sākṣātkartavyaṃ bhāvayitavyamiti / parijñātaṃ prahīṇaṃ sākṣātkṛtaṃ bhāvitamiti /	Through the setting into motion of this sermon, one should understand that it goes, that it is cast into the intelligence of another;
tasya punaḥ pravartanaṃ parasaṃtāne gamanamarthajñāpanāt /	it goes towards the intelligence of another, in that it comes to be known by another.
athavā sarva evāryamārgo dharmacakraṃ veneyasaṃtānakramaṇāt /	Or rather, the entirety of the Noble Path, the Path of Seeing, the Path of Meditation, and the Path of the Aśaikṣa, is the Wheel of the Dharma, because it penetrates into the intelligence of those to be disciplined.
tattu parasaṃtāne darśanamārgotpādanādvartayitumārabdhamataḥ pravartitamityucyate /	If the Sūtra says that the Wheel was set into motion when Kauṇḍinya realized the Path of Seeing, this is because the prefix pr+ indicates the beginning of action: pravartiṭa signifies what begins to be vartia.
atha kasmindhātau kati śrāmaṇyaphalāni prāpyante /	When theHow can one obtain the results within each sphere?

antyasya triṣu	The last, in the three Dhātus.
antyaṃ śrāmaṇyaphalamarhatvaṃ tasya triṣu dhātuṣu prāptiḥ /	The last state of srāmaṇya, or the quality of Arhat, can be acquired in the Three Dhātus.
phaladvayasya tāvadavītarāgaprāpyatvādūrdhvamaprāptiryuktā /	We can understand why the first two states, which suppose that the ascetic is not detached from Kāmadhātu, cannot be acquired in the higher spheres;
tṛtīyasya tu kasmādaprāptiḥ /	but why does the same hold for the third?
nordhvaṃ hi dṛkpathaḥ /	Higher, the Path of the Seeing of the Truths is absent.
ūrdhvaṃ hi kāmadhātordarśanamārgo nāsti /	Above Kāmadhātu, the Path of Seeing is absent.
na ca tena vinā 'sti vītarāgasyānāgāmi phalaprāptirityetat kāraṇam /	In its absence, a person detached from Kāmadhātu and reborn in a higher heaven cannot obtain the state of Anāgāmin.

ārupyeṣu tāvat śravaṇābhāvādadhodhātvanālambanācca / rūpadhātau tu	With respect to Ārūpyadhātu, because hearing is absent.
asaṃvegādiha vidhā tatra niṣṭheti cāgamāt //	Disgust is absent there, because the Sūtṛa says, "Here one undertakes, and there one achieves.
rūpāvacarā hi pṛthagjanāḥ samāpattimukhasaṅgā duḥkhavedanābhāvācca na saṃvijante /	" Pṛthagjanas, reborn in Rūpadhātu, are totally given over to the bliss of absorption: all suffering sensation is absent in them;
na ca vinā saṃgenāryamārgaḥ śakto labdhum /	therefore disgust is impossible there, and one cannot enter the Noble Path except through disgust.
iyaṃ tāvadyuktiḥ / āgamo 'pyayaṃ “pañcānāṃ pudgalānāmiha vidhā tatra niṣṭhā antarāparinirvāyiṇo yāvadūrdhvaṃsrotasa” iti /	Furthermore, the Sūtra says, “Five persons, the Antarāparinirvāyin being the first and the Ūrdhvasrotas being the fifth, undertake here and achieve there.
vidhā hi mārgarambho nirvāṇopāyatvāt /	” “Undertake”, vidhā, means to establish the Path, because it is the means to Nirvāṇa.
idamuktaṃ “yadyakopyaḥ kṣayajñānādanutpādamati” riti /	We have seen that: If the Arhat is Immovable, then after his Knowledge of Destruction there arises the Knowledge of Non-Arising”;

They will be defined on p. Sthitākampyas, Prativedhanādharmaṇs, and Akopyadharmans.

vimuktiḥ sāmayikyeṣām /	Their deliverance is occasional.
eṣāṃ ca pañcānāṃ sāmayikī kānta cetovimuktirveditavyā / nityānurakṣyatvāt /	It should be known that the deliverance of mind of these five types of Arhats is occasional and dear, for it should be constantly guarded.

samayāpekṣāścaite 'dhimuktāśceti samayavimuktā madhyapadalopāt dhṛtaghaṭavat /	Depending on the occasion, they are delivered: this compound is made by omitting the middle term. We have thus samayavimukta, delivered by reason of the occasion, like ghṛ̥taghata, a pot full of butter, a pot for butter.
eṣāṃ hi samayāpekṣāsamādhisaṃmukhībhāva upakaraṇārogyadeśaviśeṣāpekṣatvāt / akopyākopyadharmaṇaḥ //	For them, the realization of absorption depends on saaya, on circumstances: possession of a number of material goods, the absence of illness, a ceṟtain place.
akopyadharmaṇastvakopyā vimuktiḥ / kopayitumaśakyatvādaparihāṇitaḥ /	The deliverance of an Immovable One cannot be moved because he cannot fall away from this deliverance;
ato 'samayamukto 'sau	consequently it is immovable.
ata evāsamayavimukti ucyate /	Thus he is not occasionally delivered.
sa hyasamayāpekṣāvimuktiśca / icchātaḥ samādhisaṃmukhībhāvāt /	It follows that an Immovable One is not occasionally delivered.
kālāntarātyantavimuktito vā kopyākopyadharmaṇoḥ samayāsamaye vimuktatvaṃ parihāṇisaṃbhavāsaṃbhavataḥ /	As he realizes absorption of his own accord, he is delivered independently or circumstances. Or rather samaya signifies “time”: the first five Arhats are susceptible of falling away from their deliverance, they are thus delivered for a time, and so are samayavimukta; the sixth Arhat is not susceptible of falling away from his deliverance, he is. thus definitively delivered, and so he is an asamayavimukta.

sthitākampyo yaḥ parihāṇipratyayaṃ balavantamantareṇānurakṣannapi sthātuṃ bhavyo na hātuṃ nāpi vardhayituṃ vinābhiyogena /	A Cetanādharman is an Arhat who is capable of putting an end to his existence at will, without being an Anurakṣaṇādharman, etc. An Anurakṣaṇādharman is an Arhat who is capable of preserving himself from falling away. A Sthitākampya is an Arhat who when strong causes of falling away are absent, even without preserving himself, is not capable of being budged, that is to say, who dwells in his result; but, not falling away, in the absence of any effort, he is not.
prativedhanābhavyo yo 'kopyaḥ prativeddhaṃ bhavyaḥ /	A Prativedhanādharman is an Arhat who is capable of penetrating without effort the Immovable Oṇnes.
akopyadharmā yo naiva parihātuṃ bhavyaḥ /	An Akopyadharman or an Immovable One is an Arhat who is not capable of falling away.
prathamau dvau pūrvameva śaikṣāvasthāyāṃ sātatyasatkṛtyaprayogavikalau /	When they were Śaikṣas, the first two lacked continual cultivation and intensive cultivation;

But, in the hypothesis where the Parihāṇadharman necessarily falls away, where the Prativedhanādharmaṉn necessarily.
kaḥ punareṣāṃ kutaḥ parihīyate / phalāt gotrādvā / gotrāccaturṇāṃ pañcānāṃ phalāddhāniḥ	Among the first five Arhats, how many can fall away from their families, and how many can fall away from their results? Four fall from their families, and five fall from their states.

na pūrvakāt / yasya yat prathamagotraṃ sa tasmānna parihīyate / śaikṣāśaikṣamārgābhyāṃ dṛḍhīkutatvāt /	The Arhat does not fall away from his first family, from the family which he obtained before he became an Arhat, for this family has been made firm by the Path of the Śaikṣa and the Aśaikṣa.
śaikṣastu laukikalokattarābhyāṃ dṛḍhīkṛtatvāt na parihīyate svagotrāt /	The Śaikṣa does not fall away from his first family, for this family has been made firm by the worldly path and the transworldly path.
yattu paścāt pratilabdhamuttāpanayā tasmāt parihīyate / yasya ca yat prathamaṃ phalaṃ sa tasmānā parihīyate /	But one can fall away from the family which one has obtained by the perfecting of his faculties.

ata eva srota āpattiphalānnāsti parihāṇiḥ / evaṃ ca kṛtvā parihāṇadharmaṇastrayaḥ prakārā bhavanti /	Therefore he does not fall away from the state of Srotaāpanṇna.
tadavasthasya parinirvāṇamindriyasaṃcāraḥ / parihāya vā śaikṣatvam /	It results that from these two principles, three cases are possible with respect to the Parihāṇadharman: the Parihāṇadharman either obtains Nirvāṇa by staying in his family, or by pe:fecting his faculties, or by falling away and again becoming a Śaikṣa;
cetanādharmaṇaścatvāraḥ / eta eva trayaḥ parihāṇadharmagotrapratyāgamanaṃ ca / evamanyeṣāṃ trayāṇāmekaikaprakāravṛddhacyā yathākramaṃ pañca ṣaṭ sapta prakārā veditavyāḥ /	four cases are possible with respect to the Cetanādharman: three as above, plus: or by falling away and becoming a.

kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ prathamānām nāsti parihāṇiḥ / darśanaheyānāmavastukatvāt / ātmādhiṣṭhānapravṛttā hyete /	Why does one not fall away from the first state?
satkāyadṛṣṭimūlakatvāt /	Because the defilements abandoned through Seeing have no support in fact, having satkāyadr̥ṣṭi for their root, they exist with the ā$rnan for their support;
sa cātmā nāstīti /	now there is no ātman.
asadālambanāstarhi prāpnuvanti / nāsadālambanāḥ /	Do you pretend that these defilements have for their object a thing that does not exist?
satyālambanatvāt / vitathālambanāstu /	They have the Truths for their object, they consist of considering the pādānaskandhas as permanent, etc. Therefore they do not have a thing that does not exist for their object, but they are mistaken with respect to this object.
katamaśca kleśo naivamasti viśeṣaḥ /	How do the defilements which are abandoned through Seeing differ from those which are abandoned through Meditation? TheseDefilements are also mistaken with respect to their objects. They differ from those which are abandoned through Seeing.
ātmadṛṣṭihi rūpādike vastuni kārakavedakavaśavartitvenātmatvamabhūtamadhyāropayati tadadhiṣṭhānānuvṛttāścāntagrāhadṛṣṭacyādaya ityavastukā ucyante	One indeed sees that the idea of self falsely attributes to real things, physical matter, etc. , which are not "self" the quality of "self" under the aspect of a being which acts, a being which feels, or of Īśvara. And the other views, the view of clinging to extremes exist having as their support this same "quality of self"; as a consequence their support is non-existent, they have no support.
bhāvanāheyāstu rāgapratighamānāvidyā rūpādike vastuni kevalaṃ saktyāghātonnatyasaṃprakhyānabhāvena vartanta iti savastukā ucyante / asti ca tacdhrātādimātraṃ yatra teṣāṃ pravṛttayaḥ na tvātmādileśo 'pi /	But the defilements which are abandoned through Meditation, namely desire, hatred, pride, and ignorance, have for their nature attachment, antipathy, satisfaction, and confusion with respect to physical matter, etc. : they are therefore, speaking absolutely, a support and in this respect differ from the defilements which are abandoned through Seeing.
tathā hi bhāvanāheyānāmasti pratiniyataṃ vastumanāpāmanāpalakṣaṇaṃ na tu darśanaheyānāmātmādilakṣaṇam /	For the agreeable, the painful, etc. , is real with respect to what exists, whereas there is not a trace of self, of things pertaining to self, of Īśvara, etc. Another explanation: The defilements which are abandoned through Meditation have a determined support, characterized as agreeable, painful, etc. But, for the defilements which are abandoned through Seeing, there is no determined support which is characterized as self or as a thing pertaining to self;
tasmādapyavastukāucyante /	consequently they do not have a support.
api khalvāryasyānupanidhyāyataḥ smṛtisaṃpramoṣāt kleśa utpadyate nopanidhyāyato rajjvāmiva sarpasaṃjñā /	Another point: Among the Āryans who do not reflect, the defilements which are abandoned by Meditation can arise by reason of the weakness of mindfulness; these defilements do not arise among the Āryans who reflect. In the same way that one thinks a rope is a snake if one does not observe it carefully;
na cānupanidhyāyata ātmadṛṣṭacyādīnāmupapattiryujyate santīrakatvāditi nāsti darśanaheyakleśa prahāṇātparihāṇiḥ /	so too when one’s attention is lacking, one forgets its metaphysical characteristics, the impermanence of the pleasant, etc. but the error of personalism cannot arise among Āryans who do not reflect, because this error is a product of reflection. Consequently, the saint cannot fall away from the abandoning of the defilements which have been abandoned through Seeing.
arhatvādapi nāsti parihāṇiriti sautrāntikāḥ / eṣa eva canyāyaḥ / kathamidaṃ gamyate /	The Sautrāntikas say that one can no longer fall away from the quality of Arhat. And their opinion is correct, as one can demonstrate by scripture and by reasoning.

“śaikṣasya cāpramādakaraṇiye 'pramādakaraṇīyaṃ vadāmī” tyuktaṃ nā 'rhataḥ /	” It is said, “I declare that the Śaikṣa should cultivate vigilance. ” The Blessed One did not proscribe vigilance to the Arhat.

tato 'haṃ na kenacit paryāyeṇa parihāṇaṃ vadāmī“ti coktam /	” Yet the Sūtra specifies that, if the Arhat can fall away, it is only from the “blisses”: “With respect to immovable deliverance of mind, which is actualized physically, I declare that one absolutely cannot fall away from it. ' But the Vaibhāṣikas answer: The Blessed One specifies that one cannot fall away from deliverance of the mind when it is immovable; therefore one can fall away from it when it is occasional.
sāmayikyā astīti cet / vayamapyevaṃ brūmaḥ /	We are indeed in agreement: One can fall away from the.
sā tu vicāryā /	But what is this deliverance?
kimarhattvamāhosviddhacyānānīti /	Is it, as you think, the quality of Arhat? Should one not believe rather that the Blessed One designates the worldly Dhyānas by “occasional deliverance”?
maulo hi dhyānasamādhiḥ samaye saṃmukhībhāvātsāmayikī cimuktirityucyate /	Since the absorption which consists of the fundamental Dhyānas is realized under certain circumstances--for example in a place free from noise, etc. --it is termed "occasional deliverance";
dṛṣṭadharmasukhavihārārthaṃ ca punaḥ punareṣaṇīyatvātkāntetyucyate / āsvādanīyatvādityapare /	it is also called "cherished deliverance," because, each time that it is lost, one desires it anew with a view to enjoying the "blisses. " According to another master, this absorption is called "cherished deliverance" because, being impure, it is "delectable.
arhattvavimuktistu nityānugatatvānna yujyate /	" But the deliverance which constitutes the quality of Arhat is not "occasional" since it is possessed in a permanent manner;
sāmayikī apunaḥprarthanīyatvānna kānteti /	it is no longer "cherished," because one does not have to search it out anew.
yadi cārhattvāt parihaṇisaṃbhavo 'bhaviṣyat kimarthaṃ bhagavānādhicetasikebhya eva dṛṣṭadharmasukhavihārebhyaḥ parihāṇimavakṣyat /	If it were possible for one to fall away from the quality of Arhat, why did the Blessed One say that the Arhat could only fall?
ato gamyate sarvasyaivārhato vimuktirakopyādṛṣṭadhrmasukhavihāretyustu /	Consequently immovable deliverance of the mind belongs to all the Arhats.
kaścit lābhasatkāravyākṣepadīṣāt parihīyate vaśitvabrhaśādyo mṛdvindriyaḥ /	As for the “blisses,” a certain Arhat can fall away from them, when, being distracted by property and honors, he loses his mastery in absorption: this is an Arhat whose faculties are weak.
kaścinna parihīyate yastīkṣṇendriyaḥ /	A certain Arhat does not fall away from them: this is an Arhat whose faculties are sharp.
tatra yaḥ parihīyate sa parihāṇadharmā /	The Arhat who falls away from the “blisses” is a Parihāṇadharmaṇ;

aparihāṇadharmasthitākampyākopyadharmaṇāṃ ko viśeṣaḥ / aparihāṇadharmā 'nuttāpanāgataḥ / akopyadharmā tūttāpanāgataḥ /	What difference is there between an Aparihāṇadharman, a Sthitākampya and an Akopyadharmaṇ? The first has not perfected his faculties: they have been sharp from the very beginning;
tau hi yaṃ yameva samāpattiviśeṣamutpādayatastasmānna parihīyete /	the third has perfected his faculties: neither of them fall away from the absorptions that they are able to produce.

Such is the difference between these three saints. But did not the Venerable Godhika fall away from the quality of Arhat?
āyuṣmānbhautikaḥ śaikṣībhūtaḥ sāmayikyā vimukteratyāsvādanānmṛdvindriyatvāccabhīkṣṇaṃ	The Venerable Godhika, being a Śaikṣa, by reason of the excess of his enjoyment and the weak character of his faculties, fell away many times from “occasional deliverance”: in his disgust, he struck himself with a dagger.

“dīrgharātra vivekanimnaṃ cittaṃ bhavati yāvannirvāṇaprāgbhārami“ti vacanāt / arhato hyetadbalamanyatroktam /	Now this Āryan Śrāvaka is not a Śaikṣa, but an Arhat, for the Sūtra says later, “For a long period of time his mind is inclined towards distant separation from the defilements. His mind is turned towards Nirvāṇa.”
“sarvairāsravasthānīyairdharmaiḥ śītībhūtaṃ vāntībhūtami“ti cābhidhānāt astyetadevam /	And we know further that these qualities, “having the mind inclined towards separation,” etc. , are some of the powers of the Arhat, which power is yet determined by the words, ‘his mind is cold, purged with respect to all the dharmas in which the vices have their abode.

sāsravānāsravaṃ jñānaṃ tayoḥ punaḥ	but, in short there are only two: Knowledge is pure or impure. All the Knowledges are subsumed into two types of knowledge, impure or worldly knowledge, and pure or supermundane knowledge.
ādyaṃ saṃvṛtijñāpakam /	Of these two knowledges, the first is called conventional.
yatsāsravaṃ tatsaṃvṛtijñānam /	Impure Knowledge is called "knowledge conforming to worldly conventions. " Why?
prāyeṇa ghaṭapaṭastrīpuruṣādisaṃvṛtigrahāt / ajñānasaṃvṛtatvāt ityapare / anāsravaṃ dvidhā dharmajñānamanvayameva ca // anāsrvaṃ jñānaṃ dvidhā bhidyate /	Because from usage it bears on things which exist conventionally, a jug, clothing, male, female, etc. Pure knowledge is of two types, a knowledge of dharmas and inferential knowledge.
dharmajñānamanvayajñānaṃ ca / evagete dve jñāne trīṇi bhavanti / saṃvṛtijñānaṃ dharmajñānaṃ ca /	These two knowledges with the preceding make three knowledges: worldly, conventional knowledge, a knowledge of dharmas, and inferential knowledge.
tatra sāṃvṛtaṃ sarvaviṣayaṃ	Among these.
saṃvṛtijñānasya sarvadharmāḥ saṣkṛtāsaṃskṛtā ālambanaṃ saṃbhavataḥ / kāmaduḥkhadigocaram /	All the conditioned and unconditioned dharmas are the object of conventional knowledge. The knowledge of dharmas has for its object the Suffering, etc. , of Kāmadhātu.

duḥkhasamudayanirodhamārgajñānāni / tadālambanatvāt /	Namely: the knowledge of Suffering (which includes the knowledge of the dharmas of Suffering and the inferential knowledge of Suffering), the knowledge of Origin, the knowledge of Extinction, and the knowledge of the Path, because these two knowledges have Suffering, its Origin, etc. , for their object.

te punaḥ prathamodite // duḥkhahetvanvayajñāne	At the moment when they arise, they are inferential knowledges of Suffering and Origin.
prathamotpanne tu kṣayajñānānutpādajñāne duḥkhasamudayānvayajñāne duḥkhasamudayākārairbhāvāgrikaskandhālambanatvāt /	The Knowledge of Destruction and the Knowledge of Non-Arising, at the moment when they first arise are, by their nature, inferential knowledge of Suffering and of its Origin in the higher spheres, because they have for their object the skandhas of Bhavāgra under the aspects of Suffering and Origin. These two knowledges therefore have the same object. The Knowledge of Destruction follows Vajropamasamādhi; and the Knowledge of Non-Arising follows the Knowledge of Destruction.
kim khalu vajropamo 'pi tābhyāmekālamvano 'sti /	Does Vajropamasamādhi have the same object as these two?

bhūmyatikrāntaṃ na jānātīti /	It does not know a mind in a higher sphere, faculties, personalities, nor the past and future. A mind is superior either from the point of view of its bh%mi, from the point of view of its indriyas, ot from the point of view of its personality.
adharadhyānabhūmikenottaradhyānabhūmikamindriyātikrāntaṃ na jānāti /	The knowledge of the mind of another of a lower sphere does not know a mind in a higher sphere.

ta dharmānvayadhīpakṣyamanyo 'nyaṃ	The knowledge of dharmas and inferential knowledges do not know one another.
dharmajñānapakṣyaṃ paracittajñānamanvayajñānapakṣyaṃ cittaṃ na jānāti /	The knowledge of the mind of another, when it is by its nature a knowledge of dharmas, is not capable of knowing the mind of another which is by nature inferential knowledge;
anvayajñānapakṣyaṃ ca dharmajñānapakṣyaṃ na jānāti /	when it is inferential by nature, it is not capable of knowing the mind of another which is by nature a series of dharmas. Why?
kāmadhāturdhvadhātupratikṣālambanatvāttayoḥ /	Because these two knowledges have for their object the dharmas which are opposed to Kāmadhātu and to the higher spheres respectfully.
darśanamārge paracittajñānaṃ nāsti / tadālambanaṃ tvasti /	There is no knowledge of the mind of another in the Path of Seeing. That is to say, an ascetic, while he cultivates the Path of Seeing, is not endowed with the knowledge of the mind of another. But the mind of another which is found in the Path of Seeing can be the object of the knowledge of the mind of another.
tatra paracittajñānena darjñanamārga jñātukāmaḥ prayogaṃ kṛtvā prathamau	When one desires to know, through the knowledge of the mind of another, the mind of another which is found in the Path of Seeing, one cultivates a preparatory exercise.

śrāvako darśanamārgāt paracittajñānena dvau kṣaṇau jānāti / duḥkhe dharmajñānakṣāntiṃ dharmajñānaṃ ca /	the Pratyekabuddha, three; the Buddha, without preparation, all. When a Śrāvaka cultivates the knowledge of the mind of another in the desire to see the mind of an ascetic in the Path of Seeing, he obtains some knowing of the first tvo moments, the Patience of the Knowledge of the dharmas of Suffering end the knowledge of dharmas — but ṉot the following moments (the Patience of the Inferential Knowledge of Suffering.
anvayajñānapakṣālambanasyānyaprayogasādhyatvāt /	)—because the knowledge of the inferential part (Suffering in the higher spheres) of the Path of Seeing supposes a different preparatory. Thus, if this Śrāvaka then begins a new exercise in order to obtain the knowledge of the inferential part, the ascetic whom he examines has already arrived at the fifteenth moment when this new preparatory exercise is finished.
yāvacca sa tatra prayogamāra mate tāvadayaṃ ṣoḍaśacittamanuprāpto bhavatītyantarā na jānāti /	The whole interval between the twelfth and the sixteenth moment therefore is not in the sphere of the knowledge of the mind of another of the Śrāvaka.
pratyekabuddhastrīn kṣaṇān /	In the same circumstances, the Pratyekabuddha knows three moments, namely the first two and the eighth;
prathamau ca dvāvaṣṭamaṃ ca samudayānvayajñānaṃ mṛduprayogatvāt /	because the required preparatory exercise, after the consciousness of the first two moments, for the knowledge of the inferential part, is, among the Pratyekabuddhas, weak.
prathamadvitīyapañcadaśānityapare /	According to other masters, he knows the first two moments and the fifteenth.
buddhastu sarvāneva darśanamārgakṣaṇānaprayogeṇa jānāti /	The Buddha, through simple desire, and without preparatory exercise, knows the mind of another in all the moments of the Path of Seeing.
atha kṣayajñānānutpādajñānayoḥ ko viśeṣaḥ /	What are the characteristics of the Knowledge of Destruction and of the Knowledge of Non-Arising?

anutpādajñānaṃ katamat /	"What is the Knowledge of Non-Arising?
duḥkhaṃ me parijñātaṃ na pounaḥ parijñeyamiti jānāti yāvat mārgo bhāvito na punarbhāvayitavya iti / tadupādāye“ti vistareṇoktaṃ śāstre /	When one knows within himself that ‘Suffering is completely known by me and is no longer to be known. the Path is no longer to be cultivatedʼ, then this knowledge .
kathamanāsraveṇa jñānenaivaṃ jānāti /	is what is called the Knowledge of Non-Arising.” But how can one, through a pure knowledge, have such a knowledge? Two conventional knowledges are consecutive to two pure knowledges: “Suffering is known by Ṟme.
tatpṛṣṭhalabdhena vyutthita evaṃ jānāti /	Suffering is known by me and is no longer to be known.”
atastadviśeṣeṇa tayorviśeṣaḥ /	It is by reason of the characteristic of these two conventional knowledges that the Śāstra defines the two pure knowledges. According to other masters, the ascetic knows, through a pure knowledge, that he knows Suffering, etc. But we have said that the Knowledge of Destruction and the Knowledge of Non-Arising are not seeing, or views.
śāstre jñāpiota iti kāśmīrāḥ /	How can the Śāstra define them as views?
anāsraveṇāpyevaṃ jānātītyapare darśanavacanaṃ tu bhāṣyākṣepāt /	The Śāstra employs the term “view” through stylistic habit, using again the formula employed in the definition of the other knowledges. Or rather, by reason of their characteristic of being directly perceived, these two knowledges are qualified as seeing.
jpratyakṣavṛttitvādvā / ata evoktaṃ “yāvat jñānaṃ darśanamapi tadi“ti /	It is by reason of this characteristic of being directly perceived that it says in the Śāstra, “Knowledge is seeing.

kṛtakṛtyataḥ kṣayajñānaṃ kṛtakṛtyasaṃtānotpatteḥ /	Because "that which should have been done has been done," there is the Knowledge of Destruction: this knowledge is the first knowledge to arise in a series in which "that which should have been done has been done.

vimuktaṃ kuśalaṃ tābhayaṃ vimuktatvāditi vaibhāṣikāḥ /	Such is the explanation of the Vaibhāṣikas.
evaṃ tu sūtraṃ nānulomitaṃ bhavati / eṣāṃ ca padānāṃ nārthaviśeṣa ukto bhavati /	This explanation, does not conform to the Sūtra and it does not take into account the meaning of the terms.
sūtra uktaṃ “kathaṃ cittamadhyātmaṃ saṃkṣiptaṃ bhavati /	The Sūtra says, “What is a mind internally concentrated?
yaccittam styānamiddhasahagatamadhyātmaṃ saṃnirodhasahagataṃ no tu vipaśyanayā samanvāgatam / kathaṃ vahirvikṣiptaṃ bhavati /	A mind which is accompanied by torpor and laziness, or a mind internally accompanied by calm but not insight.
yaccittaṃ pañcasu kāmaguṇeṣvanuvikṣiptaṃ bhavatyanuvisṛtami“ti /	”A mind which is dispersed towards the five objects of pleasure, or which is externally accompanied by insight, but not by calm.
nanu coktaṃ tadeva cittaṃ saṃkṣiptaṃ syādvikṣiptaṃ ceti /	But, we have said that if a mind associated with laziness is concentrated, a defiled mind, when it is associated with laziness, will be at one and the same time concentrated and distracted. Yes, you have said this, but it does not hold.
uktamidamayuktaṃ tūktaṃ viddhasahagatasya kliṣṭasya vikṣiptatvāpratijñānāt /	In fact, we can only affirm that a defiled mind, when it is associated with laziness, is distracted.
nanu coktaṃ śāstravirodhaḥ syāditi /	But, your thesis contradicts the Śāstṛa! It may.
varaṃ śāstravirodho na sūtravirīdhaḥ /	But it is better to contradict a Śāstra than a Sūtra.
kathameṣāṃ padānāṃ nārthaviśeṣa ukto bhavati /	How does this explanation lack the proper meaning of the different terms?
vikṣiptalilinoddhatāvyupaśāntāsamāhitābhāvitāvimuktānāṃ cittānāmabhinnalakṣaṇavacanāt saṃkṣiptapragṛhītādīnāṃ ca / na vai noktaḥ padānāmarthaviśeṣo bhavati / kliṣṭasāmānye 'pi taddoṣasaṃdarśanāt /	Because it gives the characteristics of different minds—distracted, sunken-down, small, not calm, non-absorbed, uncultivated, and undelivered on the one hand, and concentrated, well in hand, etc. , on the other hand—without noting their differences. The quality of "defiled" of distracted minds, etc. , is the same;
ityapyetat kliṣṭaṃ cittaṃ vikṣiptaṃ līnamiti vistaraḥ /	but we explain the particular defects of these different defiled minds.
evaṃ kuśalasyāpi guṇaviśeṣasaṃdarśanādukta evarthaviśeṣo bhavati /	In the same way we explain the particular qualities of the different good minds, in which their good qualities are not differentiated.
sūtravirodhasyāparihārānnaiṣa eṣāṃ padānāmarthaḥ /	We answer that the meaning of the different terms is not correctly established because you fail to eliminate the objection of contradiction with the Sūtra. A mind accompanied by torpor and laziness is concentrated. A mind united with laziness, and defiled through union with torpor, is concentrated, but it cannot be good, for torpor is a kÉ/eśamahābhūmika.
yadi ca sūtre tadeva līnaṃ cittaṃ tadevoddhatamityabhipretaṃ syāt idaṃ noktaṃ syāt /	Aṇnd if, , the Sūtra designates, by the sunken-down mind, a small mind, it would not speak separately of a sunken-down mind and a small mind.
“yasminsamaye līnaṃ cittaṃ bhavati layābhirśaṅka vā akālastasminsamaye prasrabdhisamādhyupekṣāsaṃvodhyaṅgānāṃ bhāvanāyāḥ /	Now it distinguishes them, for it says, "When the mind is sunken down, or fears becoming sunken down, this is not a proper time to cultivate".
yasminsagaye uddhātaṃ cittaṃ bhavati auddhatyābhiśaṅki vā akālastasminsamaye dharmavicayavīryaprītisaṃvodhyaṅgānāṃ bhāvanāyā” iti /	When the mind is small or fears becoming small, this is not a fitting moment to cultivate the dharmavicaya, vīrya, and prīi paṟts of Bodhi.
kiṃ punarvodhyaṅgānāṃ vyagrā bhāvanā /	Objection Is the cultivation of the parts of Bodhi partial in the case which concerns us?
manasikaraṇaṃ teṣāṃ bhāvaneṣṭā na saṃmukhībhāva ityadoṣa eṣaḥ /	When the text says "cultivation", it does not signify the fact of actualizing, but the fact of fixing the attention on, or taking as an object.
kauśīdyādhikamatra cittaṃ līnamityuktam /	The mind in which indolence dominates and in which frivolity is reduced is called "sunken down".
auddhatyādhikaṃ coddhatamityavirodhaḥ /	The mind in which frivolity dominates and in which indolence is reduced is called "small". These two minds are therefore distinct, and the Sūtra can speak of them separately without contradicting our system.
tayostu sahabhāvāttadeva cittaṃ līnaṃ tadevoddhatamiti brūmaḥ /	But, taking into consideration the fact that these two defilements, indolence and frivolity, coexist in a single mental heap, we say that the mind which is sunken.
nābhiprayikaṃ vacanaṃ vāryate /	We do not pretend to challenge a text of intentional meaning;
sūtre tu nāyamabhiprāya iti brūmaḥ /	but such is not the intention of the Sūtra to designate a mind in which indolence dominates as sunken down.
yattūktaṃ “sarvameva rāgasaṃprayuktaṃ cittaṃ sarāgami“ti / katamaccittaṃ rāgasaṃprayuktam /	In the thesis presented above that all minds "united with craving" possess craving, what is the meaning of the expression rāgasaṁynkta, united with craving?
rāgaprāptisahitaṃ cet / asāsravamiti sarāgaṃ prāpnoti śaikṣacittam /	If a mind is united with craving, and as a consequence possesses craving, because the possession of craving continues in the series in which this mind is produced, then the mind of an imperfect saint or Śaikṣa, even when it is pure, will be termed "possessing craving", since the craving has not been completely expelled from the series of the Śaikṣa.
rāgālambanaṃ cet / arhato 'pi sāsravaṃ cittaṃ sarāgamiti gṛhlīyāt / rāgālambanatvāt kathaṃ vā tatsāsravam /	If a mind is both united with craving and possesses craving through the fact of being the object of the "active craving", then the impure mind of an Arhat will possess craving, since this mind can be the object of the craving of another person. If you do not admit that the mind of an Arhat can be grasped as an object through the craving of another person, how can this mind be termed impure?
sāmānya kleśālambanatvāditi cet /	Would you say that it is impure, not because it is the object of the craving of another, but because it is the object of a “general defilement” of another? In this hypothesis, do not say that this mind is sarāga, that it “possesses cravingʼ;
evamapi samohaṃ gṛhlīyānmohālambanatvāt /	say rather that it is semoha, that it “possesses moha,” since it is the object of the or ignorance of another. But, we would say, none of these proposed explanations is valid.
na ca paracittajñānaṃ prāptyālambanaṃ nāpi taccittālambanaṃ rāgālambanam /	In fact the knowledge of the mind of another does not bear on the “possessions” which can be found in the series of another. Consequently when I know that the mind of another person possesses craving, this mind of another does not possess craving because it is “united with craving” in the sense that it is accompanied by the possession of craving, or in the sense that it is found in the series in which this possession has not been expelled. The knowledge of the mind of another no longer knows the craving which would be the object of the mind of another.
tasmānna rāgasaṃprayogātsarāgaṃ cittamatreṣṭam /	Therefore a mind is not termed rarāga through the fact of rāgasaṁyoga, through the fact of being “united with rāga” in the proposed twofold sense.
kiṃ tarhi /	If this is the case, what is a serāga mind? One should determine the intention of the Sūtra. A sarāga mind or one “possessing craving” is not a rāgasaṁyukta mind, a mind “united to craving”, but a rāgasaṁprayukta mind, a mind “associated with craving,” a mind in which craving presently exists.
rāgasaṃprayuktaṃ cittaṃ sarāgamasaṃprayuktaṃ vigatarāgamiti sūtrābhigrāyo dṛśyate /	Vigatarāga, “without craving” is a mind which is not associated with craving, even when this mind will be accompanied by the possession of craving.
yat tūktaṃ “vigatarāgamasya taccittaṃ bhavati vigatadveṣaṃ vigatamohamanāvarttikadharmi kāmabhave rūpabhave ārupyabhave” iti / tatra tatpraptivigamaṃ saṃdhāyoktam /	The expression vigatarāga cannot have this meaning; for another Sūtra says that a mind which is without craving, without anger, and without ignorance, does not fall back into threefold existence.
nanu coktam anyakleśasaṃprayuktamapi cittaṃ rāgaviprayuktatvādvigatarāgaṃ syādi“ti /	Now if this mind is accompanied by the possession of craving, etc. , it will fall back again. In this other Sūtra, “a mind without craving” signifies “a mind which is not accompanied by the possession of craving”. Have you not refuted your own opinion? We said in fact that if one calls a mind without craving vigatarāga, that is, a mind in which craving is not presently active, then one should terrm all minds associated with another defilement vigatarāga.
etenābhisaṃdhinā na doṣaḥ /	But one does not say that a mind associated with hatred is vigaṭarāga, “without craving.”
na tu tadvigatarāgamiti kṛtvā gṛhyate / kiṃ tarhi / sadveṣaṃ samohamityevamādi / alaṃ prasaṅgena siddhānto varṇyatām /	There is nothing wrong with saying that a mind withoūt craving is véga$arāga. But one does not consider a mind without craving but associated with hatred as being vigatarāga, but rather as “possessing hatred”, distinguishing it through its specific chaṟacteristic which is one of being The Knowledges.
kiṃ paracittajñānaṃ paracittasyākāramālambanaṃ vā gṛhlāti /	When the knowledge of the mind of another attains its object, namely the mind of another person, does it attain this mind of another as this latter knows it? When one knows the mind of another, one does not see.
na gṛhlāti ākāralambananirapekṣaṃṃ hi tadraktamidaṃ cittamiti jānāti natvamuṣmin rupe raktamiti jānāti /	One does not see this mind as it itself knows something: one knows only that it is defiled, etc. ; one does not know the object, colot, etc. , by reason of which it is defiled.
anyathā hi tadrūpālambanamapi syāt tadālambanaṃ ca paracittaṃ gṛhlataḥ svabhāvagrahaṇaṃ prāpnuyāt /	If it were otherwise, the knowledge of the mind of another would bear on rpa, etc. ,and would no longer be the knowledge of the mind of another; the knowledge of the mind of another would bear on itself: for the person whose mind I know can at the same moment know my mind.
sarvaṃ ca paracittajñānaṃ dravyasvalakṣaṇacittacaittapratyutpannaparasaṃtatikāmarūpapratisaṃyuktāpratisaṃyuktaviṣayaṃ darśanamārgapratiṣiddhaṃ bhāvanāmārga upalabhyate /	The characteristics of the knowledge of the mind of another are set: it knows the individual characteristics of a thing but not its general, conventionally true characteristics; it knows mind and mental states but not physical matter, the present but not the past or future, of another but not of oneself, of the sphere of Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu, but not of Ārūpyadhātu; or rather the pure mind and mental states, of the category to which he himself belongs: pure, he knows a pure mind and rmental states; impure, he.
śūnyatā 'nimittasamādhi viprayuktaṃ kṣayānutpādajñānāsaṃgṛhītamānantaryamārga pratiṣiddhaṃ ca vedittavyam /	The knowledge of the mind of another is incompatible with the Path of Seeing and the Uninterrupted Path, with the Samādhi of Emptiness and the Samādhi of No-Marks, and with the Knowledge of Destruction and the Knowledge of Non-Arising.
uktaṃ paracittajñānam /	Other conditions are not excluded: the knowledge of the mind of another is compatible with the Path of Meditation (the Path of Liberation, vimuktimārga, and the Path of Distinction, viśesamārga), with the Uncommitted Samadhi (gpraṇéhitasamādhi, etc. The teaching of the knowledge of the mind of another is ended.
śeṣe caturdaśākāre śūnyānātmavivarjite /	The other has fourteen aspects by excluding the aspect of emptiness and the aspect of non-self. The “‘others” are the Knowledge of Destruction and the Knowledge of Non-Arising.
kṣayānutpādajñāne śeṣe te caturdaśākāre śūnyānātmakārau varjayitvā /	Both have fourteen aspects, excluding the aspect of emptiness and the aspect of non-self. In fact, these two Knowledges, even though they are of the absolute level of truth, are also included in the conventional level of truth. They are.
pāramārthikayorapi saṃvṛtibhajanāt śīṇā me jātirnāparamasmādbhavaṃ prajānāmīti tadvalānuvyavahārataḥ /	When an ascetic departs from the contemplation in which the knowledges of the absolute truth are realized, through the force of these knowledges, later knowledges are produced which are of the conventional level of truth: “my births are cut off, the religious life has been fully cultivated, I have done what should have been done, and I do not know of any more existences for me. " The two knowledges, the Knowledge of Destruction and the Knowledge of Non-Arising, therefore participate in the conventional level of truth, not in and of themselves or through definition, but through their outflowing.
kimanāsravaḥ svalakṣaṇākāro 'styatha na /	Are there any pure aspects outside of these sixteen aspects? There are no pure aspects outside of the sixteen.

Āccording to the Masters of Kaśmīr, the Śāstra does not teach the existence of these two additional aspects. One should understand, it is fitting that a pure mind distinguish these dharmas as impermanent.

dvitīyaḥ samudayastena tatsamudāgamātphalasyevāṅkurādiprasavaḥ /	it is called herx. The second desire is that which brings about re-existence—as the production of the shoot, ṣtalk, etc. , is a casual process or arising which brings about fruit; it is therefore called samudaya, a cause which brings forth.
tṛtīyastajjātīyaduḥkhapratyayaḥ / phalasyeva kṣotrodakapāśyādikam /	The third desire is the cause which determines the quality of suffering,—as the field, the water, the fertilizer, etc. , determine the virility, the ripening, the appearance of the fruit; it is therefore called prayaya, or condition.

When one thinks I am," general affection for one’s own person without determination is produced, which is fivefold: I am such;

The first desires are the initial cause of suffering; they are therefore the betu. The rest as above.

The arising aspect is opposed to the view, "There is only one cause"—be it Ilśvara, or pradhāṇa. Cause is a complex. The appearance aspect is opposed to the idea of evolution, the theory that bhāva, or existence, existing initially, transforms itself: rather, bhāva begins.

It is therefore correct to say that “aspect” is a mode of perceiving objects by the mind and mental states.

ata eva tadābhisamayāntikaṃ saṃvṛtijñānamākhyāvate / ekaikasatyābhisamayānte bhāvanāt /	It is termed abhisamayāntika jñānṉa, because it is cultivated at the end of the comprehension of each Truth.
kasmānna mārgānvayajñāne bhāvanāṃ gacchati /	Why does an ascetic not take possession of it at the mornent of inferential knowledge of the Path?
mārgasatyasya pūrva laukikena mārgeṇānabhisamitatvāt akṛtsnābhisamayācca /	Because the Path has not been understood formerly, through a worldly path, under its aspects of Path, Truth, etc. b.

na kadācit ekāntena hi tadānutpattidharmakam /	At no moment is there the possibility for it to arise. This knowledge does not arise when the ascetic is in contemplation, nor when the ascetic has left his contemplation.

lokottaramārga-sāmarthyāt saṃvṛtijñānaṃ bhāvyate yad vyutthitaḥ satyālambanam viśiṣṭataraṃ laukikaṃ jñānaṃ saṃmukhīkaroti /	After one has left the contemplation of the Āryamārga, a conventional knowledge bearing on the Truths is realized, and it is much more distinguished than that which precedes the obtaining of the Āryamārga itself.

If one cultivates conventional knowledge at the end of Suffering and Origin, — that is to say in the moments of the inferential knowledge of Suffering and the inferential knowledge of Origin, — conventional knowledge is by nature the four.
nirodhe 'ntyaṃ nirodhe 'bhisamite yat saṃvṛtijñānaṃ tadantyaṃ smṛtyupasthānaṃ dharmasmṛtyupasthānam / ekasya parisaṃkhyānātsiddhaṃ bhavati śeṣaṃ catvāri smṛtyupasthānānīti / taccaitadābhisamayāntikaṃ saṃvṛtijñānaṃ	If one cultivates at the end of Extinction, it is only the last foundation of mindfulness, namely the foundation of mindfulness related to dharmas.

etāmeva ca trividhāṃ saṃpadaṃ manasikurvāṇena viduṣā śakyaṃ buddhānāṃ bhagavatāmantike tīvraprema gauravaṃ cotpādayituṃ yaduta hetusaṃpadaṃ phalasaṃpadamupakārasaṃpadaṃ ca /	The word ecera indicates that the Dharma of the Buddhas lasts a long or short period of time, accordingly as, at theAll intelligent persons who reflect on the threefold perfection of the Tathāgatas necessarily produce a profound affection, a profound respect with respect to thern. This threefold perfection is the perfection of their causes which consists of the provisions of merit and knowledge; the perfection of the result which consists of the dharmakāya; and the perfection of benefit which consists of service to all beings.
tatra caturdhā hetusaṃpat / sarvapuṇyajñānasaṃbhārābhyāso dīrghakālābhyāso nirantarābhyāsaḥ satkṛtyābhyāsaśca /	The perfection of cause is fourfold: Cultivation of the accumulation of all qualities and all knowledge; prolonged cultivation; uninterrupted cultivation; and zealous cultivation.

ityetatsāmāsikaṃ buddhānāṃ māhātmyam /	Such are, in short, the perfections of the Buddhas.
anantaprabhedaṃ tu tadbhidyamānaṃ jāyate /	There would be no end of our discussion if we were to speak of them in great detail.

Araṇā is the power to hinder the arising of another's defilements.
tatrāraṇā nāma kaścidevārhan kleśaprabhavaṃ sattvānāṃ duḥkhaṃ viditvātmānaṃ ca dakṣiṇīyaviśeṣaṃ	The Arhats know that the sufferings of beings are produced through their defilements; they know that they themselves are the most worthy field of merit; they fear.
pareṣāṃ tadālambanaṃ kleśotpādaṃ parihartukāmastādṛśaṃ jñānamutpādayati bhena pareṣāṃ sarvathā 'pi raṇaṃ notpādayati / na kasyacittadālambano rāga utpadyate dveṣo māno vā / naiṣā pratipat kañcideva raṇayatītyaraṇā / sā punareṣā	Thus they generate a knowledge of such a nature that no other person will produce, with respect to them, lust, hatred, pride, etc. This knowledge puts an end, in beings, to raṇa, or conteation, which is a defilement, a cause of torment: it is thus called rgṇā oṟ absence of contention. What are the characteristics of the so-called Araṇā Samādhi, the Absorption Absence of Contention?
saṃvṛtijñānamaraṇā	Absence of Contention is conventional knowledge;
ayamasyā svabhāvaḥ /	By nature it is conventional knowledge, as it results from its object.
dhyāne 'ntye	It is of the sphere of the Fourth Dhyāna;
caturthadhyāna bhūmikā sukhapratipadāmagratvāt /	It exists in the Fourth Dhyāna, which is the best of the easy paths.
akopyadharmaṇaḥ /	It is produced by a person who is Immovable.
nānyasyārhataḥ / anyo hi svasaṃtānādapi kadācit kleśaraṇaṃ parihartu na śaknoti /	It is produced by Immovable Arhats and not by others: for others are not capable of radically cutting off their own defilements and so they cannot arrest the defilements of others.
nṛjā	It is produced by humans.
manuṣyeṣvevotpadyate triṣu dvīpeṣu /	It is produced by humans, for it is only a being in the human.
anutpannakāmāptasavastukleśagocarāḥ //	It relates to the defilements of Kāmadhātu, is future, and has a real object.
anāgatāḥ kāmāvacarāḥ savastukāḥ kleśāḥ asyā ālambanaṃ nāpareṣāṃ kleśa udapādītyevaṃ pravṛttatvāt /	It bears on the defilements of others, in Kāmadhātu, in the future, and “has a real object” , “May no defilements arise in others with respect to me!” The savas$:uka defilements are craving, anger, etc. , which are abandoned through Meditation.
avastukāstu kleśā na śakyāḥ parihartuṃ sarvatragāṇāṃ sakalasvabhūmyālambanatvāt /	The avasinka defilements of others, which are abandoned through Seeing, are not susceptible of being arrested, for the universal defilements, which exist in the totality of their sphere, also exist in the series of another.
yathā cāraṇoktā	As is the Samādhi Absence of Contention, 37a-b.
tathaiva praṇidhijñānaṃ	So too the Knowledge Resulting from Resolution.
tadapi hi saṃvṛtijñānaṃ dhyāne 'ntye 'kopyadharmaṇaḥ manuṣyāśrayaṃ ca	Like the Samādhi Absence of Contention, the Knowledge Resulting from Resolution is, by nature, conventional knowledge; like Absence of Contention, it exists in the Fourth Dhyāna, it is produced in the series of an Immovable One, and it is meditated upon by a being in the human realm of rebirth.
sarvālambaṃ tu tat	But it has all for its object.
sarvadharmālambanaṃ tu praṇidhijñānamityeva viśeṣaḥ /	But, unlike the Samādhi Absence of Contention, it bears on all the dharmas.
ārupyāstu na sākṣāt prāṇidhijñānena jñāyante /	Yet the Vaibhāṣikas say that the dharmas of Ārūpyadhātu are not known by a direct seeing through the Knowledge Resulting from Resolution—being of the Fourth Dhyāna, this knowledge does not bear on a higher sphere. These dharmas are known through inference. In fact, one knows the outflowing of Ārūpyadhātu, namely the extreme calm which follows, in a subsequent existence, from a former existence in Āripyadhātu. The conduct of Ārūpyadhātu, that is to say the practice of the Ārūpya Samāpattis which will produce an existence in Ārūpyadhātu,—-and one can infer from a cause to its result and from a result to its cause. As the farmer knows a seed from its fruit and a fruit from its seed, seeing a calm person, one concludes, “He is reborn falling from Ārūpyadhātu, but he will be reborn in Ārūpyadhātu.”
kiṃ tarhi / niṣpannacaritaviśeṣāt / karṣakanidarśanaṃ cātreti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	Such is the opinion of the Vaibhāṣikas.
praṇidhipūrvakaṃ jñānaṃ praṇidhijñānaṃ yaddhi praṇidhāya prāntakoṭikaṃ caturtha dhyānaṃ samāpadyate / idaṃ jānīyāmiti tadyathābhūtaṃ jānāti / sarvastatsamādhiviṣayaḥ	Others believe however that the Knowledge Resulting fromOne who would produce the Knowledge Resulting from Resolution begins by forming a resolution, holding a certain object in his consciousness; he enters into the Fourth Dhyana: this is the preparatory exercise. As soon as he leaves this absorption, he produces an exact consciousness in conformity with his resolution the sphere of which varies according to the power of his absorption.
tathā / dharmārthayorniruktau ca pratibhāne ca saṃvidaḥ //	So too the Unhindered Knowledges of dharmas, of objects, of etymological explanations, and of eloquence.
catasro hi pratisaṃvidaḥ / dharmapratisaṃvidarthapratisaṃvinniruktipratisaṃvitpratibhānapratisaṃvicca / tā api dharmārthaniruktipratibhānapratisaṃvidastathaiva yathā 'raṇā / kimāsāṃ tathaiva akopyadharmamanuṣyāśrayatvam /	There are Four Unhindered Knowledges: the Unhindered Knowledge of dharmas, the Unhindered Knowledge of things, the Unhindered Knowledge of etymological explanations, and the Unhindered Knowledge of eloquence. They are like the Samadhi Absence of Contention in that they belong solely to the Inmmovable Ones who are humans.
ālambanabhūmisvabhāvaviśeṣastvāsāṃ pṛthagucyate /	But they differ from it with respect to their object, the sphere in which. They are acquired, and their nature.
tisro nāmathavāgjñānamavivartya yathākramam /	The first three are unhindered knowledges bearing, in this order, on name, the thing, speech.
nāmapadavyañjanakāyeṣvarthavācitā avivartyajñānaṃ dharmāthaṃniruktipratisaṃvido yathākramam /	Infallible knowledge of names, phrases, and syllables is the Unhindered Knowledge of dharmas. Infallible knowledge of the thing is the Unhindered Knowledge of things. Infallible knowledge of speech is the Unhindered Knowledge of etymological explanation.
caturthīyuktomuktābhilāpamārgavaśitvayoḥ //	The fourth is the knowledge of exact and facile expression, and of mastery with respect to the Path.
avivartyaṃ jñānamiti vartate / yuktamutābhilāpitāyāṃ samādhivaśisaṃprakyāne cāvivartyaṃ jñānaṃ pratibhānasaṃvit / vāṅmārgālambanā cāsau	Infallible knowledge which confers the capacity to express oneself in an exact and facile manner and which also confers never failing attention on a person who is a master in absorption is the Unhindered Knowledge of eloquence.
vākca mārgaśca tasyāḥ ālmvanam /	Its object is speech and the Path;
nava jñānāni	it is made up of nine knowledges. Speech and the Path are the object of this Unhindered Knowledge. It is made up of nine knowledges.
navajñānasvabhāvā pratibhānapratisaṃvidanyatra nirodhajñānāt / sarvabhūḥ /	Which, in its nature, is made up of nine knowledges with the exception of the knowledge of extinction.
sarvabhūmikā cāsau kāmadhātau yāvat bhavāgre vāṅmārgayoranyatarālambanāt /	It can arise in an ascetic who exists in any of the spheres, from Kāmadhātu to Bhavāgra, since it has for its object either speech or the Path.
daśa ṣaḍvā 'rthasaṃvit	Unhindered Knowledge of things is made up of ten or six.
arthapratibhānasaṃvit sarvadharmāśccedarthā daśa jñānāni /	Artha or thing signifies “all the dharmas”: in which case the Unhindered Knowledge of things is, by its nature, the ten knowledges;
nirvāṇaṃ cedarthaḥ ṣaṭ jñānāni / dharmānvayanirodhakṣayānutpādasaṃvṛtijñānāni /	but if artha signifies Nirvāṇa, then it is made up of six knowledges: the knowledge of dharmas, inferential knowledge, the knowledge of extinction, the Knowledge of Destruction, the Knowledge of Non-Arising and conventional knowledge.
sā sarvatra	It arises everywhere.
sā punareṣā 'rthapratisaṃvit sarvabhūmikā /	That is to say it can exist in any sphere.
anye tu sāṃvṛtam //	The others are conventional knowledge.
anye tu dve dharmaniruktipratisavidau saṃvṛtijñānasvabhāve nāmakāyādivāgālambanasvabhāvatvāt /	Two Unhindered Knowledges are conventional knowledge, for they have names, phrases, and syllables, etc. , and speech, for their object.
kāmadhyāneṣu dharme vit	The Unhindered Knowledge of dharmas exists in Kāmadhātu and the Dhyānas.
dharmapratisaṃvit pañcabhūmikā kāmadhātucaturthadhyānasaṃgṛhītā ūrdhvaṃ nāmakāyābhāvāt /	It therefore exists in five spheres.
vāci prathamakāmayoḥ / vāṅniruktir ity eko 'rthaḥ /	Above them, names are absent.
niruktipratisaṃvitkāmadhātuprathamadhyānabhūmikā ūrdhvaṃ vitarkābhāvāt /	According to the Prajñaptipāda, the Unhindered Knowledges are in the following order: 1. the infallible knowledge of name, phrase, and syllable;
prajñaptau tu pratisaṃvidāmeva nirdeśaḥ /	the knowledge of the thing expressed by its name, etc. ;
“padavyañjane tasyaivarthe tasyaikadvivahustrīpuruṣādyadhivacane tasyāsaktatāyāmavivartyajñānaṃ dharmāvipratisaṃvida” ityata evāsāṃ kramasiddhiḥ nirvacanaṃ niruktiḥ /	the knowledge of the expression of the characteristics of the thing, its number, its gender, the time, etc. ; the knowledge of what is not possible either of the expression, or of phrases and syllables. In this way the order of the Unhindered Knowledges is justified.
yathā rupyate tasmādrūpamityevamādi / uttarottarapratibhā pratibhānamityapare /	According to others, mÉrukri is an etymological explanation, for example: rāpyate tasmād rāpam, vijānātīti vijñānam, cinotīti ciṭtam.
āsāṃ ca kila pratisaṃvidāṃ gaṇitaṃ buddhavacanaṃ śabdavaidyā hetuvidyā ca pūrvaprayogo yathākramam / nāpyeteṣvakṛtakauśalastā utpādayituṃ śaknotīti /	According to the School, the preparatory exercises of the Four Unhindered Knowledges are, in this order, the study of calculation, the word of the Buddha, the study of sounds, and the study of causes, for a person who has not cultivated these four disciplines is not capable of producing the Four Unhindered Knowledges.
buddhavacanameva tu sarvāsāṃ prayogaṃ varṇayanti /	But, in fact, the study of the word of the Buddha alone suffices to achieve the four preparatory exercises.
yasya caikā tasyāvaśyaṃ catasraḥ pratisaṃvidī bhavanti / vikalābhirna tallābhī	One only obtains them together. If a person obtains one Unhindered Knowledge, he obtains the others;
nahi vikalābhistābhiḥ pratisaṃvillābhī bhavati /	if he does not obtain them all, he does not obtain any of them.
ye caita upadiṣṭā araṇādayo guṇāḥ / ṣaḍete prāṇtakoṭikāḥ //	The six qualities described above, Absence of Contention, etc. These six are prāntakoṭika.
prāntakoṭikadhyānavalenaiṣāṃ lābhaḥ / tatṣaḍivadhaṃ	They receive this name because they are obtained through the power of the Prāntakoṭika Dhyāna.
tadapi prāntakoṭikaṃ caturtha dhyānaṃ ṣaḍātmakam / araṇāpraṇidhijñānaṃ tisraḥ pratisaṃvidaḥ / tadeva prantakoṭikam /	It is sixfold. The Fourth Prāntakotika Dhyāna is made up of six things: it consists of 1. Absence of Contentioa, 2.
niruktipratisaṃvidastadvalena lābho na tu sā caturthadhyānabhūmikā /	the Knowledge ResultingEven though the Unhindered Knowledge of etymological explanation may be obtained through the power of a Prāatakoṭika Dhyāna, it does not arise in the Fourth Dhyāna, for it has Kāmadhātu and the First Dhyāṇna for its sphere; consequently it is not included within the Fourth Prāntakoṭika Dhyāna.
kiṃ punaridaṃ prāntakoṭikaṃ nāma /	What is the Prāntakoṭīka Dhyāna?
dhyānamantyaṃ caturthaṃ dhyānam /	It is the last dḥyāna in the Fourth Dhyāna.
sarvabhūmyanulomitam / vṛddhikāṣṭāgataṃ tacca kathaṃ sarvabhūmyanulomitam /	It is the last dhyāna, in a series with all the spheres and carried to its maximum.
kāmāvacarāccittātprathamaṃ dhyānaṃ samāpadyate /	The Fouṟth Dhyāṇa is “in a series with all the spheres” when one cultivates it in the following manner: from a good mind of Kāmadhātu, oṉe enters into the First Dhyāna;
tato dvitīyamevaṃ krameṇa yāvannaivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatanam /	from the First Dhyāṇna, into the Second, and so oṅ up to naivasaṁjñānāsaṁjñāyaṣ¢ana ; then, one redescends to a good mind of Kāmadhātu;
pratilomaṃ punaryāvatkāmāvacaraṃ cittaṃ tataḥ punaranulomaṃ yāvaccaturthadhyānamevaṃ sarvabhūmyanulomitam / katham vṛddhikāṣṭāgatam /	finally, from this mind, one ascends again to the Fourth Dhyāṇna. One cultivates the Fourth Dhyāna; after having cultivated in an inferior manner, one cultivates in a medium manner;
tathābhāvitānmṛduno madhyaṃ madhyādadhimātraṃ samāpadyate / vṛddhiprakarṣo hi vṛddhikāṣṭā /	after having cultivated in a medium manner, one cultivates in a superior manner. Each one of these three categories is divided into three. The Fourth Dhyāna is therefore made up of nine categories. The highest category of the Fourth Dhyāna is called “carried to the maximum”.
idamīdṛśaṃ prāntakoṭikaṃ pragatā 'nta koṭirasyeti kṛtvā /	The Dhyāna which possesses these two qualities is called prāntakoṭ¢ika, because its end has been traversed to the extreme.
koṭiḥ punaratra vṛddhiḥ prakāro vā / catuṣkoṭikavat /	Koṭi signifies both “type” and “summit, apex,” as one says: cāéukoṭika prasna, that is, a fourfold question; or as one says: bhātakoṭi, “the limit of existence.”
ete punaḥ buddhatuṇāḥ	These qualities of the Buddha are acquired through effort. With the exception of the Buddha, the other Āryans acquire these six qualities, the Samādhi Absence of Contention, etc. , only through effort, and not through detachment, since all do not possess them.
buddhānyasya prayogajāḥ // buddhādanyasya prāyogikā na vairāgyalābhikāḥ /	The Buddha alone acquires them through. Later, he actualizes them at his will, without effort;
buddhasya nāsti kiñcit prāyogikam / tasya sarvadharmeśvaratvādicchāmātra pratibadhaḥ sarvaguṇasaṃpatsaṃmukhībhāvaḥ /	for the Buddha is the master of all the dharmas that he possesses. We have explained the three categories, Absence of Contention, Knowledge Resulting from Resolution, the Unhindered Knowledges, which are common to the Āryans.
ime tāvacchrādakasādhāraṇaguṇā abhijñādayaḥ pṛthagjanairapi / keyamabhijñā nāma /	Among the qualities which also belong to ordinary persons we must explain the Supernormal Knowledges.
ṛddhhiśrotramanaḥpūrvajanmacyutyudayakṣaye /	Realization of the knowledge of supernormal power, of ear, of the mind, of past existences, of death and rebirth, of the destruction of the cankers; this is the sixfold supernormal knowledge.
jñātasākṣīkriyā 'bhijñā ṣaḍvidhā	There are six supernormal knowledges: 1.
ṛddhiviṣaye jñānasākṣātkriyā abhijñā /	the supernormal knowledge which consists of the realization of the knowledge of the sphere of rddhi or supernormal power (that is to say, displacement and creation); the supernormal knowledge which consists of the realization of the knowledge of divine. the supernormal knowledge which consists of the realization of the knowledge or consciousness of the mind of another the supernormal knowledge which consists of the realization of the knowledge of the memory of past existences the supernormal knowledge which consists of the realization of the knowledge of divine sight of the death and birth of all beings
divyaśrotracetaḥparyāyapūrvanivāsānusmṛticyutyutpapādāsravakṣayajñānasākṣātkriyā abhijñāḥ /	the supernormal knowledge which consists of the realization of the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers
etāḥ ṣaḍabhijñā / āsāṃ pañca pṛthagjanaiḥ sādhāraṇāḥ / sarvāstvetāḥ	Even though the sixth supernormal knowledge belongs only to the Āryans, since the first five are also possessed by ordinary persons, and by reason of the characteristics of the greatest number of supernormal knowledges, here all of the supernormal knowledges are considered as common to the Āryans and to ordinary persons
muktimārgadhīḥ //	They are prajñā of deliverance
vimuktimārgaprajñāsvabhāvāḥ / śrāmaṇyaphalavat /	They are by their nature the prajñā of the Path of Deliverance, like the results of the religious life
catasraḥ saṃvṛtijñānaṃ	Four are conventional knowledge.
cetaḥparyāyāsravakṣayajñānābhijñe hitvā /	Four, with the exception of the supernormal knowledge of the minds of others and the supernormal knowledge of the destruction of the cankers, are conventional knowledges.
cetasi jñānapañcakam /	The knowledge of the mind of another is made up of five knowledges.
cetaḥparyāyābhijñā pañca dharmānvayamārgasaṃvṛtiparacittajñānāni /	The fifth supernormal knowledge is by nature the knowledge of dharmas, inferential knowledge, a knowledge of the Path, conventional knowledge, and the knowledge of the mind of another.
kṣayābhijñā balaṃ yadvat	The supernormal knowledge of the destruction of the cankers is similar to the power.
yathāsravakṣayajñānavalamuktaṃ tathā veditavyā / ṣaḍ daśa jñānānīti /	Exactly like the power of the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers, this supernormal knowledge is made up of six or ten knowledges.
sarvabhūmikā 'pyeṣā tathaiva jñātvyā / śeṣāstu	So too, it can exist in all of the spheres and relates to all objects.
pañca dhyānacatuṣṭaye //	Five exist in the Four Dhyāṇnas.
pañcābhijñāḥ caturthadhyānabhūmikāḥ /	The first five supernormal knowledges exist in the Four Dhyānas, that is to say, they are obtained by an ascetic in any of these Dhyānas.
kasmādārupyabhūmikā na santi /	Why do they not exist in the non-material absorptions, the Ārṛūpyas?
tisrastāvanna santi /	The first three have rāpa for their object. Thus one cannot produce them in the ārpyas.
rūpālambanatvāt /	The knowledge of the mind of another is prepared through the gate of physical matter, that is to say through a path which has color and shape for its object.
cetaḥparyāyābhhijñāpi nāsti rūpatīrthābhiniṣpādyatvāt /	Now the non-material absorptions do not have physical matter for their object.
pūrvanivāsasmṛtirapyanupūrvāvasthāntaramaraṇābhiniṣpatteḥ /	As for the memory of previous existences, the ascetic prepares for this by going over again and again the course of successive states; now the non-material absorptions do not have the dharmas of Kāmadhātu for their object, and when a memory of past existences is actualized, it bears, as the Sūtra says, on the place, the gotra, etc. , and on material dharmas.
sthānagotrādyālambanatvācca / paracittaṃ hi jñātukāma ātmanaḥ kāyacittayornimittamudgṛhlāti /	In fact, the ascetic who wishes to know the mind of another first considers, in his own series, the characteristics of his body and mind, “Such is my body, such is my mind.”
kīdṛśe 'pi me kāye kīdṛśaṃ cittam bhavaty evaṃ pareṣāmapyābhujataścittajñānādabhiniṣpannā bhavati /	As he has considered his own body and mind, in this same way, envisioning the series of another, he takes into consideration the characteristic of the body and mind of another: thus he knows the mind of another and the.
abhiniṣpannāyāmabhijñāyāṃ rūpanirapekṣo jānāti /	When the supernormal knowledge is realized, the ascetic no longer considers the rāpa of the body; he directly knows the mind. The ascetic who wishes to remember his past existences, begins by grasping the characteristic of the mind which has just perished;
pūrvanivāsaṃ samanusmartukāmaḥ samanantaraniruddhamanovijñāno nimittamudgṛhya tatsamanantaraprātilomyenāvasthāntarāṇi manasikaroti / yāvatsaṃdhicittam /	from this mind, he again considers the states which it immediately succeeds in the present existence up to the mind at conception.

tato 'ntarābhavasyaikakṣaṇaṃ maraṇe 'pi niṣpanno bhavati / evaṃ parasyāpi smarati /	In order for him to remember the previous existences of another, the preliminary exercise is the same. The ascetic who is a beginner in the practice of this supernormal knowledge knows these existences only in their chronological order;
abhiniṣpannāyāṃ vilaṅghyāpi smaraṇam /	when this practice is acquired, he remembers them by skipping over one or two existences.
anubhūtapūrvasyaiva smaraṇam /	One remembers only that which has been experienced previously.
śuddhāvāsānāṃ katham smaraṇam /	If this is the case, how can there be remembrance of the Śuddhāvāsas? These gods do not return here, the ascetic does not.
śravaṇenānubhūtatvāt /	He remembers them because he has experienced them through his hearing. The person who remembers them understands, “The gods called Śuddhāvāsas are such.” The experience, in fact, is twofold, through seeing and hearing.
ārupyacyutasyehopapannasya parasaṃtatyadhiṣṭhānenotpādanam /	Beings who, falling from Ārūpyadhātu, arise here produce this supernormal knowledge by means of the series of another. In fact the knowledge which consists of the memory of past lives belongs to the sphere of a Dhyāna, and one cannot, through this knowledge, know a mind which is in Ārūpyadhātu.
anyeṣāṃ svasaṃtatyadhiṣṭhānena /	Other beings are known by means of their own series.
ṛddhyādīnāṃ tu laghatvaśabdālokamanasikaraṇaṃ prayogaḥ /	The preparation of the first three supernormal knowledges—the supernormal knowledge of the sphere of rddhi, of dīvine hearing, and divine sight,—consists of the observation of lightness, sound, and light. When this preparation is achieved, the ascetic obtains mastery in each case.

svādhobhūviṣayāḥ	They have their own sphere or a lower sphere for their domain.
yadbhūmikā ṛddhacyabhhijñā bhavati tāṃ bhūmi tayā gacchati /	Through the Supernormal Knowledge of magical power of a certain sphere, acquired in a certain dhyāna, one possesses the powers of displacement and creation in this sphere or in a lower sphere, but not in a higher sphere.
nirmiṇoti vā adharāṃ noktarām / evaṃ divyaśrotrābhijñayā svabhūmikameva śabdaṃ śṛṇotyadharabhūmikaṃ vā nordhvabhūmikam /	So too, through the Supernormal Knowledge of divine hearing, one understands the sounds of the sphere to which the Supernormal Knowledge belongs, or the sounds of a lower sphere, but not the sounds of a higher sphere.
cetaḥ paryāyābhijñayā nordhvabhūmikaṃ cittaṃ jānāti /	Through the Supernormal Knowledge of the mind of another, one does not know the mind of another when it is of a sphere higher than that of the Supernormal Knowledge.
pūrvanivāsānusmṛtyā na smarati / cyutopapādābhijñayā na paśyati /	Through the Supernormal Knowledge of the memory of past existences, one does not obtain the memory of existences in a sphere higher than that of the Supernormal Knowledge.
ata evārupyabhumikaṃ cittaṃ cetaḥparyāyapūrvanivāsabhijñābhyāṃ na gṛhlātyurdhvabhūmikatvāt /	Consequently, a mind in Ārūpyadhātu cannot be attained either through the Supernormal Knowledge of the knowledge of the.

labhyā ucitāstu virāgataḥ /	Already cultivated, they are acquired through detachment.
janmāntarābhyastā abhijñā vairāgyato labhyante vaiśeṣikyaḥ prayogataḥ /	When they have been cultivated in a past life, they are acquired through detachment. Nevertheless, intense, they are acquired only through effort.
sarvāsāṃ tu prayogeṇotpādanam /	Their manifestation always supposes an effort, except in the case of the Buddha, who acquires any of the Supernormal Knowledges through simple detachment, and actualized them at will.
tṛtīyā trīpyupasthānāni cetaḥparyāyābhijñā trīṇi vedanācittadharmasmṛtyupasthānāni / cittacaittālamlbanatvāt /	The supernormal knowledge of the mind of another contains three applications of mindfulness, - vedanā, citta, and dharma.
ādyaṃ śrotrardvivakṣuṣi //	The supernormal power, hearing, and sight make up the first application of mindfulness.
abhijñeti vartate / ṛddhidivyaśrotradivyacakṣurabhijñā ādyaṃ smṛtyupasthānamityarthaḥ / rūpālambanatvāt /	The supernormal knowledges of supernormal power, divine hearing, and divine sight, make up the first application of mindfulness, that is, the body as an application of mindfulness, for they have rāpa, color and shape, for their object.
ṛddhiścaturbāhyāyatanālambanā 'nyatra śabdāt /	The supernormal knowledge of supernormal power has four external āyatanas, with the exception of sound, for its sphere.
divyaśrotracakṣurabhijñe śabdarūpāyatanālambane /	And divine hearing and divine sight have both sound and rāzpa for their domain.
kathaṃ tarhi “cyutopapādajñānenaiva jānāti amī bhavantaḥ sattvāḥ kāyaduścaritena samanvāgatāḥ” ityevamādi /	If this is the case, how can the Supernormal Knowledge of the divine sight know, as the Sūtra explains, that “These beings endowed with bad physical actions, with bad vocal actions, deniers of the Āryaṉs, produce false views, attach themselves to views and to wrong actions, because of which, at the end of their lives, they fall into bad realms of rebirth.
na tattena jānāti /	The Supernormal Knowledge of divine sight does not know.
abhijñāparivārajñānaṃ tu tadanyadāryāṇāmutpadyate yenaivaṃ jānanti /	But there is another knowledge which accompanies the Supernormal Knowledge of divine sight, which arises in the series of the Āryan, and which knows mental action, etc. As this knowledge is produced through the power of the Supernormal Knowledges of divine sight, it receives, together with this Supernormal Knowledge, the name of “Knowledge of death and rebirth.”
anirdhāraṇāccheṣe catuḥsmṛtyupasthānasvabhāve iti siddham /	As their natures are not determined in the Kārikā, it follows in and of itself that the two Supernormal Knowledges of memory of past existences and the destruction of the cankers have for their nature the four applications of mindfulness.
avyākṛte śrotracakṣurabhijñe itarāḥ śubhāḥ /	The Supernormal Knowledges of hearing and sight are neutral; the others are good.
divyacakṣuḥśrotrābhijñe avyākṛte /	The Supernormal Knowledges of divine hearing and divine sight are morally neutral, for, by nature, they are prajñā associated with auditory and visual consciousness.
te punaścakṣuḥśrotravijñānasaṃprayuktaprajñe / kathaṃ tarhi te caturdhyānabhūmike sidhyataḥ /	If this is the case, how can one say that they are of the sphere ofIn fact, there is no visual or auditory consciousness in the Second Dhyāna and above. There is no contradiction here, for we express ourselves in this way by consideration of the organs.
āśrayavaśena tadbhūminirdeśāt / tadāśraye hi cakṣuḥśrotre caturdhyānabhūmike /	The organs, the ears and eyes, which are the support of the Supernormal Knowledges, are produced through the power of the Four Dhyānas and belong to their sphere: they therefore exist in the four spheres. The Supernormal Knowledge, being supported on the organ, is therefore said to be supported on the Four Dhyāṇnas.
ānantaryamārgavaśena vā /	Or rather, we express ourselves in this way because we consider the ānantaryamārga of the Supernormal Knowledge; in fact the āṉantaryamārga of the Supernormal Knowledge of divine hearing and divine sight is supported on four spheres, the Four Dhyānas.
anyāścatasraḥ kuśalāḥ /	The other supernormal knowledges are good.
yattarhi prakaraṇeṣūktam “abhijñā katamā /	If this is the case, why does the Prakaraṇapāda say, “What is supernormal knowledge?

āsāṃ cābhijñānāṃ	The supeṟrnormal knowledges are.
tisro vidyāḥ	According to the Sūtra, there are three Aśaikṣa Wisdoms. To which supernormal knowledges do these wisdoms correspond?
pūrvanivāsacyutyupapādāsravakṣayajñānasākṣātkriyāstisraḥ aśaikṣyo vidyā ucyante /	Three supernormal knowledges are wisdom, the three wisdoms—the Aśaikṣa wisdom which consists of the realization of the knowledge of past lives, the Aśaikṣa wisdom which consists of the realization of the knowledge of the death and birth of all beings, and the Aśaikṣa wisdom which consists of the realization of the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers—are, in the order of the Sūtra, the fifth, the second, and the sixth supernormal knowledges.
kasmādetā eva nānyāḥ /	Why are these three supernormal knowledges called wisdoms?
avidyāyāḥ pūrvāntādau nivarttanāt //	Because they bring about the cessation of non-wisdom relating to the past, etc. It is because the memory of past existences brings about the cessation of error.
etā hi pūrvāparāntamadhyasaṃmohaṃ vyāvartayanti yathākramam /	Relating to the past, the knowledge of death and birth brings about the cessation of error relating to the future, and the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers brings about the cessation of error relating to the present. Which of these three supernormal knowledges really belongs to the Ashaikshas?
āsāṃ paramārthena aśaikṣyantyā	The last belongs to the Ashaikshas.

kiṃ punarete abhijñe śaikṣyasya nocyete /	If this is so, why not admit that these two supernormal knowledges are, when they are produced in a Shaiksha, the wisdom of a Shaiksha. We admit that they exist in the Shaiksha, but then they are not called wisdoms because the series of the Shaiksha is associated with non-wisdom.
yataḥ śaikṣyau vidye nocyete / iṣṭe śaikṣsya nokte tu vidye sāvidyasaṃtateḥ //	In fact the Buddha did not say that these two supernormal knowledges are Śaikṣa dharmas. Why?
na hi sāvidyasaṃtāne vidyāvyavasthānaṃ yujyate / punarapyavidyābhibhavāt /	When a series is associated with non-wisdom it is not correct to give the name of wisdom to the supernormal knowledge which is produced in this series, for the supernormal knowledge is obscured by the non-wisdom. The Sūtra says that there are three methods of conversion.
āsāṃ cābhijñānām	To which supernormal knowledges do they correspond?
ādyā tṛtīyā ṣaṣṭhī ca prātihāryāṇi	The first, the third and the sixth are the methods of conversion.

vineyamanasāmādito 'tyartha haraṇāt prātihāryāṇi prātiśabdayorādikarmabṛśārthatvāt /	The prefix prasignifies ādikarmanṉ, and the prefix ati-signifies bhṛśam: these three supernormal knowledges are called prā$ihārya because, thanks to them, the work of conversion is begun and done in an. Through them, one carries away the mind of persons to be converted, from the very first and very forcefully. Or rather, they receive the name of prāihārya, for through them one first or forcefully makes oneself a master of persons who hate the Good Law, or of those who are indifferent.
pratihatamadhyasthānāṃ manāṃsyebhiḥ pratiharantīti prātihāryāṇi vā / eṣāṃ punaḥ	Through them, one makes persons of hostile, unbelieving, or non-zealous mind, produce a mind of refuge, a mind of faith, or a mind of practice.
śāsanam / agcryam	Conversion through the Teaching is the best.
anuśāsanaṃ pratihāryamagcya m /	Among the three methods of conversion, conversion through the Teaching is the best.

Further, the first two methods of conversion are only capable of captivating the mind of another for a short period of time, and they do not produce any important results. But the third method of conversion causes others to produce beneficial results; for by means of this method of conversion, the preacher teaches, in truth, the means to salvation and to well-being. What is ṛddhī?
keyamṛddhiḥ /	Ṛddhi is absorption.
vaibhāṣikanyāyena ṛddhiḥ samādhiḥ	According to the Vaibhāṣikas, the word rḍdhi designates absorption or samādhi.

tat punar dvidhā /	It is of two types. Fictive creation in Kāmadhātu is twofold, accordingly as it is connected with the body of the ascetic himself or with another: for example an ascetic transforms himself into a tiger, or he creates, apart from himself, a tiger.

Yet one can say without being incorrect that “creation consists of nine āyatanas,” for creation—whether it refers to the transformation of the body of the creator or to the creation of a distinct body—consists of four āyataṉas, physical matter odors, tastes, and tangible things, and does not exist independently of the five organs.

Dhyāna in which it exists, subtle and excellent. This rāzpa constitutes his eyes and ears; it sees and understands;

saiva cittaikāgratā /	The concentrated minds are not sarādhi. Here maeny difficulties present themselves:
nanu ca kṣaṇikatvātsarvaṃ cittamekāgraṃ dvitīyasya tasmādavikṣepa iti cet /	Since minds are momentary, each of them has a single object.
saṃprayukte samādhivaiyarthyam /	Samādhi causes the second mind to not be distracted or turned aside from the object of the first mind. But if this is the case, then the samādhi does not exercise any action with regard to the first mind which you consider as associated with samáādbhi.
yata eva ca smādhistata eva cittānāmekālambanatvaṃ kiṃ neṣyate /	Why imagine samādhi in and of itself? Why not admit that the minds are applied to a single object by reason of the causes that you assign to saādhi?
mahābhūmikatvācca samādheḥ sarvacittānāmekāgratāprasaṅgaḥ /	Finally, you have defined samādhi as a universal dharma : hence all minds should possess the characteristic of being concentrated.
na durbalatvātsamādheḥ /	No, because of the weakness of the samādhi.
cittānyevaikāgrāṇi samādhiḥ /	The Sautrāntikas say that the minds which have the same object constitute samādhi: samādhi does not exist separately.
tathā hyadhicittaṃ śikṣā cittapariśuddhipradhānaṃ ca sūtre catvāri dhyānānyuktānītyapare /	For it is said in the Sūtra that the Four Dhyānas are adhicitta fikṣa, the “higher mental learningʼʼ; another says that the Four Dhyānas are the primary element in the purification of the mind.
dhyānamiti ko'rthaḥ /	What is the meaning of the word dhyāna?
dhyāyantyaneneti / prajānantītyarthaḥ /	By reason of dhyāna the ascetic is “concentrated'” and capable.

yo 'ṅgasamāyuktaḥ samādhiḥ /	Only absorptions filled with certain excellences are called Dhyānas. So too in the world, it is the san that is called "the light maker”. What are the excellences?
sa hi śamathavipaśyanābhyāṃ yuganddhavāhitvāddṛṣṭadharmasukhavihāra uktaḥ sukhā ca pratipaditi / sutarāṃ tena dhyāyanti /	Samādhi is in fact excellent: it is an absorption filled with “'parts”, which goes by the means of the yoke of calmness and insight [that is to say, in which calmness and insight are in equilibrium], that is termed in the Sūtra “happiness in this world” (cṛṣ$adharmasukhavihāra, viii27) and “the easy path”, the path by which one knows better and easily. It is thus the excellent absorptions which are called ḍhyāna.
kliṣṭasya kathaṃ dhyānatvam /	But if dhyāṇna is an absorption filled with parts, how can a defiled absorption be called dhyāna?
mithyopanidhyānāt / atiprasaṅgaḥ / na / tatpratirūpa eva tatsaṃjñāvineveśāt pūtibījavat /	But this entails false conclusions. We give the name of dhyāna to the defiled state that resembles true dhyāṇa, as, in the world, one calls a thing that resembles a grain, although incapable of germinating, “rotten grain”, and not a pebble, etc. [In the same way one speaks of a pārājika Bhikṣu, iv.
uktāni cākuśalāni dhyānānyapi bhagavatā /	And the Blessed One speaks of bad dhyāána.
kīdṛśaṃ punaḥ kuśalamaikāgyraṃ prathamaṃ dhyānaṃ kīdṛśaṃ yāvaccaturtham /	What are the characteristics of the First to the Fourth Dhyāna?
prathamaṃ tāvat vicāraprītisukhavat	The First is filled with vôcāra, prīi, and sukha, (parts that the following successively abandon).
vicāraprītisukhasaṃyuktaṃ kuśalamaikāgyraṃ tat prathamaṃ dhyānam /	The First Dhyāna is a good concentration filled with vicāra, prīti, and rukha [that is to say, associated with a vicāra filled or associated with priti and sukha].
vicāravacanādvitarko 'pyukto bhavati / sāhacaryāddhūmāgnivat /	This also says implicitly, “filled with vitarka,” for viarka necessarily accompanies vicāra, as smoke accompanies fire.
na hi prītisukhavānvicāro vinā vitarkeṇāsti /	It does not happen that vicāra is associated withParts that the following successively abandon.
śeṣaṃ punrdhyānatrayaṃ pūrvapūrvāṅgavarjitam / śubhaikāgryam iti vartate /	The Second, Third, and Fourth Dhyāna are characterized by the successive abandoning of each of these three parts;
vicāravivarjitaṃ prītisukhavat dvitīyaṃ vicāraprītivarjitaṃ tṛtīyaṃ vicāraprītisukhavarjitaṃ caturthamiti /	eliminating vicāra, the Second Dhyāna is only filled with prīti and sukha; eliminating pīti, the Third Dhyāna is only filled with sukha; and by eliminating sukha, these three parts are absent from the Fourth Dhyāna.
yathā dhyānāni	We have described the Dhyānas. What are the Ārūpyas?
tathārūpyāḥ kena prakāreṇa /	So too, the Ārūpyas (which are made up of four rkandhas). The Ārūpyas, that is, the absorptions of, and the rebirths in Ārūpyadhātu are like the Dhyānas in their number and nature.
ete 'pi hi dvidhā upapattisamāpattitaḥ / catvāraśca eṣāmapi copapattaya uktāḥ /	There are four Ārūpyas and each Ārūpya is twofold, existence and concentration.
samāpattyārupyāsvabhedena kuśalaikāgratāsvabhāvā ityanena prakāreṇa saparivārāḥ	The concentrations of Ārūpya, in their nature and in general, are applications of pure minds on a single object. By reason of this double similarity, the stanza says “So too, theThey are made up of four skandhas.
catuskandhāḥ	The Dhyānas are accompanied by five skandhas, but the Ārūpyas are accompanied by only four skandhas, for no rāpa or physical matter accompanies it.
anuparivartirūpābhāvāt	It arises out of separation from Īower spheres.
adhobhūmivivekajāḥ //	All the Ārūpyas are concentration; but there are four Ārūpyas because the concentration that constitutes each Ārūpya proceeds from separation from a lower sphere.
caturthadhyānavivekajaṃ hyākāśānantyāyatanam / tadvivekajaṃ vijñānānantyāyatanam /	Ākāśānantyayatana is the absorption that proceeds from separation from the Fourth Dhyāṇna;
tadvivekajamākiñcanyāyatanam / tadvivekajaṃ naivasaṃjñānāsamjñāyatanamityevaṃ catvāra ārupyāḥ /	and so on to Naivasaṁjñānāsaṁjñāyatana which proceeds from separation from Ākiṁcanyāyatana.
ko 'yaṃ viveko nāma /	What is separation?
yena mārgeṇādhastādvimucyate / vairāgyagamanāt / ta eva cārupyāḥ	The paths by which the ascetic is delivered from the lower spheres, because these paths have turned him away from them.
vibhūtarūpasaṃjñākhyāḥ saha sāmantakaistribhiḥ /	They are called vibh%ūtarūpasaṁjñā together with three sāmantakas.
ākāśānantyāyatanasāmantakaṃ caturthadhyānālambanatvādvibhūtarūpasaṃjñākhyāṃ na labhate /	The first ṝāmantaka, the threshold of Ākāśānantyāyatana is not called a rāmantaka because it has the Fourth Dhyāna for its object, and so the idea of physical matter is not completely transcended in it. The Ārūpyas are so called because there is no pa or physical matter in them: they are made up of the four réandhas as mentioned above. This should be proved, say some Schools, for we maintain that there is some physical matter, rṁpa, in the Ārūpyas. But then why are the ġrāpyas called ārāpyas, 'absences of physical matter”? They are called this because their rpa is reduced, in the same way that a little red is called “reddish”" (āpiṅgala, “absence of red”).
na hi tatra rūpasaṃjñā vibhūtā na vigatetyarthaḥ /	but what type of physical matter is in Ārūpyadhātu?
yaduktaṃ “catuskandhā” iti sādhyaṃ tāvadetadārupyeṣu rūpaṃ nāstīti /	If you say that this physical matter is neither the body nor the voice, but merely the physical matter that constitutes bodily and vocal discipline (kāyavāksaṁvaramātra, the rūpa that forms part of the dharmāyatana, iv.
yadi hi syātkathamārupyā ucyeran / īṣadrūpatvā dāpiṅgalavat /	561), then how can this discipline exist?
kīdṛśaṃ tāvadīṣadrūpaṃ tatreṣyate /	And how can a rāpa derived from the primary elements, namely discipline, exist in the absence of these same primary elements?
yadi kāyavāk saṃvaramātraṃ kathaṃ tadabhāve tatsaṃvarau bhaviṣyataḥ /	If you answer that bodily and vocal discipline exists in Ārūpyadhātu without the cooperation of primary physical matter, in the same way that pure discipline exists without primary elements of their same, i. , pure, nature, then this answer does not hold, for pure discipline has impure primary elements for its support, elements in the sphere in which the Āryan is born.
na cāsati bhūte bhautikaṃ yujyate / anāsravasaṃvaravaccet / sāsravabhūtasadbhāvāt / smāpattāvapi tatpratiṣedha uktaḥ /	This proof for the absence of physical matter does not hold only for existence in Ārūpyadhātu, but also for the absorption of Ārūpyadhātu.
atha kāyo 'pyastīndriyāṇyapi rūpīṇi / kathaṃ tadīṣadrūpā iṣyante / parimāṇālpatvāccet /	If you attribute material organs to the beings in Ārūpyadhātu, how can you say that the physical matter of Ārūpyadhātu is subtle? Because their dimensions are very small; the beings are therefore of reduced rāpa, so the beings are then “without physical matter.
udakajantukeṣvapyadṛśyarupeṣu prasaṅgaḥ /	”But if you reason in this way, then the tiny and invisible aquatic animals would also be "without rūpa.
acchatvāccet /	" Would you say that the physical matter of Ārūpyadhātu is transparent?
antarābhavarūpāvacareṣvapi prasaṅgaḥ / yato nācchataraṃ cet /	But intermediate beings and the beings in Rūpadhātu also possess transparent physical matter.
bhavāgramevārupyaṃ syāt / samāpattivattadupapattiviśeṣāt /	Would you say that the physical matter of Ārūpyadhātu is more transparent and so merits being called "absence of physical matter"? But then you should only call the highest stage of Ārūpyadhātu "absence of physical matter," for bodies will be all the more transparent the more distinguished is the absorption of the stage to which they belong.
dhyānopapattirūpasyāpi cādharabhūmikendriyāgrahaṇāt kastatra viśeṣaḥ / dvayoranvarthā saṃjñā nārupyadhātoriti cet /	Furthermore, the physical matter of Rūpadhātu or of the Dhyānas cannot be perceived by an eye in a lower sphere, since it is too transparent.
kā 'tra yuktiḥ / āyuruṣmaṇoḥ saṃsṛṣṭavacanānnaḍakalāpīdvayavannāmarūpayoranyonyaniśritavacanā “dvijñānapratyayaṃ	How does this differ from the physical matter that you attribute to Ārūpyadhātu?
nāmarūpami“ti vacanāt anyatrarūpādyāvatsaṃskārebhyo vijñānasyāgatigatipratiṣedhāccārūpyeṣu	Finally, it is a gratuitous affirmation to maintain that the name of the first two Dhātus corresponds to their objects, but that this is not so in the case of Ārāpyadhātu.
rūpāstitvasiddhiriti cet / na /	It is maintained that physical matter exists in Ārūpyadhātu. There are four arguments in favor of this position: It is said that life and warmth are interconnected.
saṃpradhāryaṃ tāvadetadyadidamāyuruṣmaṇoḥ saṃsṛṣṭatvamuktam /	It is said that nmāman and physical matter support one another, iike two bunches of roses. It is said that māmarūpa are caused by the consciousness. It is said that consciousness does not come or go independently of physical matter, sensation, ideas, or the sarṅskāras. These texts are not decisive, for there is reason to interpret them: The Sūtra says that life is associated with warmth, which is physical matter.
kimidaṃ kāmāvacaramāyuḥ saṃdhāyoktamāhosvitsarvamiti /	But does this refer to all types of life or only to life in Kāmadhātu? The Sūtra says that nāman and rāpa suppozt one another.
yacca nāmarūpayoranyonyāśritatvamuktaṃ kimidaṃ kāmarūpāvacaraṃ nāma saṃdhāyoktamāhosvitsarvamiti /	But does this refer to all of the Dhātus or only to Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu? The Sūtra says ‘vi/ñānapratyayaṁ nāmarápam’.
yacca vijñānapratyayaṃ nāmarūpamuktaṃ kimatra sarva vijñānaṃ nāmarūpasya pratyayamuktamāhosvitsarve nāmarūpaṃ vijñānapratyayamiti /	But does this text teach that all consciousness either a consciousness caused by the samskaras of Kamadhatu or Rupadhatu, or a consciousness caused by the samskaras of Arupadhatu, is a cause of the material and nonmaterial skandhas? Rather, it teaches that all material and nonmaterial skandhas have consciousness for their cause.
yaccānyatra rūpādibhyo vijñānasyāgatipratiṣedhaḥ /	The Sutra denies that consciousness comes and goes independently of the four abodes of consciousness, that is, independently of rupa, vedana, samjna, and the samskaras.
kimatra sarvaireva tairvinā tatpratiṣedha āhosvit ekenāpīti /	But should this Sutra be understood as meaning independently of all of these abodes together?
aviśeṣavacanānna saṃpradhāryamiti cet / atiprasaṅgaḥ / bāhyasyāpi hyaṣmaṇa āyuṣā binā bhāvo na prāpnoti /	We would say that the Sutra expresses itself in a general manner: we do not have to interpret it, and we do not have the right to think that it refers to Kamadhatu, etc. The answer does not hold, for to hold to the letter of the Sutra, one would come to absurd conclusions: Life would necessarily accompany all warmth, even if it be external warmth.
bāhyasyāpi ca rūpasya nāmāśritatvamaviśeṣavacanāt / caturvijñānasthitivaccāhāracatuṣkavacanādrūpārupyadhātvorapi kavaḍīkārāhāraprasaṅgaḥ /	External physical matter would be supported by the noamaterial rkandhas. External physical matter would be caused by consciousness. There would be material food in Rāpadhātu and Ārūpyadhātu, for the Sūtra says, in a general way, that there are four types of food, in the same way that it says in a general way that there are four “abodes of consciousness’’: from whence you conclude that the “abode of physical matter” exists in Ārūpyadhātu.
“atikramya devān kavaḍīkārā hārabhakṣāni“ti vacanāt prītyāhāravacanāccāprasaṅga iti cet /	No, for the Sūtra, while expressing itself in a general way concerning the four types of food, formulates exceptions to the rule: it speaks of a being “who surpasses the gods who nourish themselves with material food”; and it speaks of beings “who nouṟish themselves with joy”.
ārupyeṣvapi rūpasyāprasaṅgaḥ /	Very well, but does not the Sūtra also say, and categorically so, that there is no physical matter in Ārūpyadhātu?
“rūpāṇāṃ niḥsaraṇamārupyāḥ” /	It says, “One departs from the rūpas through the Ārūpyas”;
“ye te śāntā vimokṣā atikramya rūpāṇyārupyāḥ” /	“These states of calm deliverance, beyond the rpas, namely the Ārūpyas.
“arupiṇaḥ santi sattvāḥ sarvaśo rūpasaṃjñānāṃ samatikramādi“ti vacanāt /	”now, if physical matter were to exist in the existences or the absorptions of Ārūpyadhātu, beings who are in Ārūpyadhātu would have ideas of their own physical matter. And the Sūtra would not say that an ascetic obtains these existences and absorptions by passing beyond all ideas of physical matter.
sati hi rupe svaṃ rūpamavaśyaṃ saṃjānīranniti /	Our opponent answers that the Sūtra, in these different passages, intends to speak not of physical matter in general, but of gross physical matter of a lower sphere.
audārikamadhobhūmikaṃ rūpamabhisaṃdhāyoktamiti cet / kavaḍīkāre 'pi tulyam /	We answer that, in this hypothesis, one should understand in the same sense the text relative to material food, which would exist, albeit subtly, in Rāpadhātu and Ārūpyadhātu.
dhyānānāmapi cādhobhūminiḥsaraṇatvādārupya prasaṅgaḥ / vedanādiniḥsaraṇaṃ ca kiṃ noktāḥ / adhobhūmikavedanāniḥsaraṇāt /	One should say that an ascetic leaves the rāpas through the Dhyāṇnas, and that the Dhyāṇnas belong to Ārūpyadhātu, for the Dhyānas are beyond the coarse rāpas of a lower sphere, namely Kāmadhātu.
rūpajātiṃ tu kutsnāmatikrāntā na vedanādijātim /	One should say that, through the Ārūpyas, the ascetic leaves sensation. But the Sutra does not express itself in this way. We then assume that the Arupyas are beyond any and all physical matter.
ato rūpāṇāṃ niḥsaraṇamuktāḥ /	How can the Arupyas be the 'leaving” of the rupas?
bhavena bhavasyāniḥsaraṇavacanaṃ tu tenaiva tasyāniḥsaraṇādasarvānatyanta niḥsaraṇācca /	The Blessed One, in fact, denies that existence can be the leaving of existence: “I say that one cannot leave bhava through ohava.” The Blessed One expresses himself in this manner with reason, for one cannot leave a certain existence by means of this same existence, and one can neither leave all of the existences nor definitively leave any existence by means of any existence whatsoever.

satyāṃ tesu rūpajātau kasmādrūpagataṃ veti nāvakṣyat /	If there were truly pa in the Arupyas, why did not the Blessed One say that there is repa in them, as he did for the Dhyanas?
tasmāt nārupye rūpasadbhāvaḥ	Hence, there is no physical matter in Ārūpyadhātu. If this is the case, then when a being obtains an existence in Ārūpyadhātu, his series of physical matter is cut off for numerous cosmic periods.

kasmānna vartitavyam /	Why could it not exist without physical matter?
ihaivamadarśanāt / kavaḍīkārāntareṇā 'pi vinā rūpadhātau na vartitavyam /	Because it never happens here below that a mind exists without a body.

kenāpi sarvanikāyāntareṣu kāyikamityeva pāṭhāt /	In all the sects the text merely reads “bodily happiness. ” Further, they continue, regarding the part of the Third Dhyāna called happiness, the Sūtra says in its own words that, in this Dhyāna the ascetic “experiences happiness through his body”.
“sukhaṃ ca kāyena pratisaṃvedayata” iti svaśabdena vacanācca / manaskāyeneticet / evamuktvā ko guṇaḥ /	Would one maintain that the word "through the body” signifies “through the body of the mind”, and that one should translate, “the ascetic experiences happiness through this complex which is”.
caturthe dhyāne prasrabdhibhūyastve 'pi sukhāvacanācca /	The well-being of the Fourth Dhyāṇna is certainly greater than the well-being of the first two Dhyānas, and the Sūtra does not attribute a happiness part to the Fourth Dhyāna.
sukhavedanānukūlā prasrabdhiḥ sukhamiti cet /	"The well-being of the first two Dhyānas is called happiness because it is favorable to the sensation of happiness, whereas the well-being of the Fourth Dhyāna does not have this character," "The well-being of the Third Dhyāna, like that of the first two, is favorable to the sensation of happiness;

" In this Sūtra, well-being is listed separately from happiness; it should be distinct from happiness in order for the list of the five dbarmas to be complete. Thus, in the first two Dhyānas, happiness is not well-being.

No, and for this same reason: this consciousness is favorable to samādhi. Immediately after the appearance of this consciousness, the samādhi is taken up again.

anyaspraṣṭavya kāyavijñānābhisaṃdhivacanāt /	“Bodily well-being cannot be undefiled, for the Sūtra declares that all tangible things are defiled,” we would say that this Sūtra is of intentional meaning and refers to all tangible things with the exception of physical well-being, to the consciousnesses of touch with the exception of the consciousness of touch which cognizes well-being.
na cānāsrave kiñcidaṅgaṃ sāsravaṃ kicidanāsravaṃ syāditi cet /	Do you admit that certain parts of undefiled ḍhyāna are undefiled, and that certain parts are not? The undefiled part is not simultaneous to the non-undefiled part; we know indeed that happiness does not exist at the same time as joy.
ayaugapadyātko doṣaḥ sukhaprītyasamavadhānānna pañcāṅgaṃ syāditi cet /	Then the First Dhyāna will not have five parts, and the Second Dhyāna will not have four parts. If Scripture attributes the parts of happpiness and joy to the fitst two Dhyānas, this is because these Dhyānas are susceptible, successively, to happiness and joy; in the same way Scripture attributes v and icāra—which can only exist successively—to the First Dhyāna. We affirm that vitarka and vicāra coexist;

tadapakarṣeṇottaradhyānavyavasthāpanāt / na tu saṃjñādīnāmaṅgatvamuktam /	This is why ideas and the other dharmas of the First Dhyāna are not considered as parts, for they are not cut off in the following Dhyānas. If you do not accept this explanation, then why does the First Dhyāna have only five parts?
kimartha vā pañcānāmevāṅgatvamuktam / upakārakatvāditi cet /	But, the five parts are only called parts because they are useful to the Dhyāna.
na / vitarkavicārābhyāṃ smṛtiprajñayorapakārakataratvāt /	No, this cannot be the case, since mindfulness and prajñā are more useful to the Dhyāna than are vétarka and vicāra.

na tarhi sa dravyāntaram iti kathaṃ dravyata ekādaśāṅgāni bhavanti /	But if we admit this explanation, then internal purity is not a thing in and of itself. Thus there will not be eleven things in the Dhyānas.

tasya hi dvitīyadhyānalātsamāhibhūminihsaraṇe saṃpratyaya utpadyate/	When the ascetic acquires the Second Dhyāna, he produces a profound faith: he admits that the spheres of absorption themselves can be abandoned.
so 'tradhyātmasaṃprasāda iti /	This faith is called internal purity. Faith, having purity for its characteristic, is called purity. Having abandoned externals, it flows equally and so pr@sāda is internal and equal; hence it is termed “internal purity”’ or adhyātmasaṁprasāda.

According to others, the Fourth Dhyāna is “undisturbed” because it is like a lamp which, in a sealed place, is not agitated by the wind.

If, from the Second Dhyāna on, three consciousnesses (eye, ear, and body consciousness) are absent, as well as vśtarka and vicāra, how can beings born in the three higher Dhyānas see, hear, and touch? How can they produce the bodily or vocal act of informing?

The four dhyānas which beings in the Second Dhyāna and above manifest, belong to the sphere of the First Dhyāna. Hence they are not defiled, because these beings are detached from the lower spheres;

No, for the ascetic who, before pursuing the acquisition of the result of the state of Sakrṛdāgāmin, has obtained the result of the state of Śrotaāpanna can enter into this certitude in the state of Anāgamya;

bhavagrahaṇena sāsravaṃ vastu gṛhyate /	Bhava signifies “that which is defiled”. This is another manner of presenting the doctrine of viii. 6: the absorption of enjoyment has for its object a pure but defiled absorption, not an undefiled absorption. He does not have a lower sphere for its object, for the ascetic that cultivates the absorption of enjoyment of a certain sphere is detached from the lower sphere.

sarvānvayajñānapakṣyo na dharmajñānapakṣo nādhobhūminirodhaḥ /	The undefiled dharmas grasp all inferential knowledge for their object, the sarvānvayajñānapakṣa; they do not concern themselves with the knowledge of the dharmas, the dharmajñāna, whose object, namely Kamadhātu, is too distant; they no longer concern themselves with the extinction of a lower sphere, which would be possible only if they were concerned with this sphere.
sāmantakānantaryamārgāṇāṃ tvadharā bhūmirālambanam / eṣāṃ ca punastrividhānāṃ dhyānānāṃ rūpyārūpyāṇām	The absorptions cultivated in the srārnantakas of Ārūpyadhātu have for their object the lower sphere, for they include an irresistable Path whose sole object is the lower. Among the three types of dhyāna and ārūpya absoṟptions, undefiled and supermundane, pure, and defiled, which one destroys the defilements?
anāsraveṇa hīyante kleśāḥ	The defilements are abandoned through the undefiled absoṟptions. Any undefiled absorption is capable of cutting off the defilements;
na śuddhakena /	not the pure absorptions, nor even less, the defiled absorptions. The pure absorption does not cut off the defilements of a lower sphere, for the ascetic can only obtain the pure absorption of a certain sphere because he is detached from a lower sphere;
kuta eva kliṣṭena / vītarāgatvānnādhaḥ /	he does not cut off the defilements of his sphere, for he does not oppose these defilements;
tasyaiva tadapratipakṣatvānna svabhūmau / viśiṣṭataratvānnordhvamiti /	he does not cut off the defilements of a higher sphere, because they are more subtle than he himself.
samantakena ca //	And also by means of the sáġmantakas.
dhyānārūpyasāmantakena ca kleśāḥ prahīyante śuddhakenāpi / adhobhūmipratipakṣatvāt /	If the sāmantakas of the dhyānas and the ārāpyas are pure, they cut off the defilements, because they ate opposed to a lower sphere.
kati punaḥ sāmantakāni /	How many sāmantakas, prefatory or threshold absorptions, are there?
aṣṭau sāmantakānyeṣāṃ	There are eight rāmantakas in the basic absorptions.
ekaikasyaikaikaṃ yena tatpraveśaḥ /	Each basic absorption has a sāmantaka or prefatory absorption, through which one enters into the basic absorption. Are the sāmantakas of three types,—undefiled, pure, or defiled,—like the basic absorptions?
kiṃ tānyapi trividhāni tathaiva ca teṣu vedanā / netyucyate /	Do they possess the same sensations as they do?
śuddhāduḥkhāsukhāni hi /	They are pure; they possess the sensation of equanimnity.
śuddhakāni ca tānyupekṣendriyasaṃprayuktāni ca yantabāhyatvādadhobhūmyudvegānapagamāt vairāgyapathatvācca nāsvādanāsaṃprayuktāni / āryaṃ cādyaṃ	The sāmantakas are exclusively pure and are associated with the sensation of egquanimity, because one traverses them through effort, because the abhorance of the lower sphere has not yet disappeared, and because they are the Path by which one detaches oneself from the lower sphere. Therefore they only contain the sensation of equanimity and they are not associated with enjoyment.
ādyaṃ sāmantakamanāgamyaṃ tacchuddhakaṃ cānāsravaṃ ca yadyapi sāmantakacittena pratisaṃdhibandhaḥ kliṣṭo bhavati /	The first sāmantaka is called Anāgamya. It is of two types, pure and Āryan, that is, undefiled.
samāhitasya tu kliṣṭatvaṃ pratiṣidhyate /	The samantaka mind through which one enters an existence is defiled; but the samantaka mind through which one enters absorption cannot be defiled, for this thesis has been refuted.
tridhā kecit	Some say that it is threefold.
kecitpunaricchanti /	Other masters say that the Anagamya samantaka is also associated with enjoyment. Does dhyanaantara, the intermediate dhyana, differ or not from samantaka? It differs from it.
āsvādanāsaṃprayuktamapyanāgamyaṃ sāmantakaṃ cocyate dhyānāntaraṃ ca / kimidamekārthamāhosvinnānārtham / sāmantakaṃ hi vairāgyamārgaḥ /	In fact, samantaka is the door to detachment from a lower sphere, but this is not the case for dhyanaantara.
atarka dhyānamantaram //	Furthermore, dhyanaantara is without vitarka. The first basic dhyana and the first samantaka are associated with vitarka and vicara. In the seven higher absorptions (the basic Dhyanas and their samantakas), there is neither vitarka nor vicara.
dhyānameva hi vitarkāsaṃprayuktaṃ dhyānāntaraṃ dhyānaviśeṣatvāt /	Only dhyanaantara is filled with vicara without being filled with vitarka; consequently, it is superior to the First Dhyana but inferior to the Second. This is why it is called dhyanaantara, or intermediate dhyana.
ata eva dvitīyādiṣu dhyāneṣu na vyayasthāpyate viśeṣābhāvāditi / tatpunardhyānāntaraṃ tridhā	Consequently, in the higher spheres, there is no dhyanaantara. To how many categories does dhyānāntara belong?
āsvādanāsaṃprayuktam śuddhakamanāsravaṃ ca /	It can be associated with enjoyment, a pure absorption, and an undefiled absorption.
aduḥkhāsukhaṃ tacca	It has the sensation of equanimity.
nātra sukhaṃ duḥkhamityaduḥkhāsukhamupekṣendriyasaṃprayuktamityarthaḥ /	Like the prefatory or threshold absorptions, it has the neither-disagreeable-nor-agreeable sensation, for it is associated with the faculty of equanimity.
na prītisaṃprayuktaṃ sābhisaṃskāravāhitvāt /	One progresses through it through effort and therefore it cannot be associated with satisfaction.
ata eva duḥkhā pratipat /	Hence it is considered to be a “difficult path”.
tasya tarhi dhyānāntarasya kaḥ phalaviśeṣaḥ /	What is the result of dhyānāntara?
taddhi mahābrahmaphalaṃ ca tat / tāṃ hi dhyānāntarikāṃ bhāvayitvā mahābrahmā bhavati /	It has Mahābrahmā for its result, Whoever cultivates this absorption to the highest degree is reborn as Mahābrahmā.
punaḥ sarvasamādhīn saṃkalayya trayaḥ samādhayaḥ uktāḥ sūtre / savitarkaḥ savicāraḥ samādhiḥ / avitarko vicāramātraḥ / avitarko 'vicāra iti /	The Sūtra says that there are three types of samādhi: 1) samādhi with vitarka and vicāra, 2) samādhi without vitarka but with vÉcāra, and 3) samādhi without vitarka and vicāra.
tatra dhyānāntaraṃ tāvadavitarko vicāramātraḥ samādhhiriti jñāpitam / vitarkamātrapratiṣedhāt / tataḥ savitarkavicāro'dhaḥsamādhiḥ	Dhyānāntara is samādhi without vitarka but with vicāra.
tasmāddhyānāntarādadhaḥsamādhiḥ savitarkaḥ savicāraḥ /	All samadhi that is below dhyānāntara contains vitarka and vicāra.
prathamaṃ dhyānamanāgamyaṃ ca / parato 'dvayaḥ // nātra dvayamastītyadvayaḥ /	This refers to the First Dhyāna and to any other samādhi supported by the First Dhyāna. Beyond, samādhi exists without either.
pareṇa tu dhyānāntarātsamādhiravitarko 'vicāraḥ / dvitīyadhyānasāmantakādyāvat bhavāgram / punastrayaḥ uktāḥ /	Above dhyānāntara, all samādhi is without vṛtarka and vicāra, from the sārmantaka of the Second Dhyāna to the Fourth Ārūpya absorption. The Sūtra teaches that there are three absorptions, the absorption of emptiness, the absorption of the absence of characteristics, and the absorption of the absence of intention.
śūnyatāsamādhirapraṇihita ānimittaśca / tatra ānimittaḥ samākāraiḥ	The absence of characteristics has the aspect of the Tranquil.
nirodhasatyākāraiḥ saṃprayuktaḥ samādhirānimittaścaturākāraḥ /	The absorption associated with the aspect of the Truth of Extinction, that is, the absorption in which the ascetic considers extinction, is called the absorption of the absence of characteristics. This absorption has four aspects. Why does it receive this name?
nirvāṇaṃ hi daśanimittāpagatatvādanimittam / tadālambanaḥ samādhirānimittaḥ /	Because Nirvāṇa or extinction, being free from ten characteristics is called animit$a.
pañcaviṣayastrīpuruṣatrisaṃskṛtalakṣaṇanimittāni daśa /	The absorption that has NirvāṇaThe ten characteristics or marks are: the five āyatanas, exterṉal sources of the sense consciousnesses, physical matter, sound, etc. ; male and female; and the three characteristics of conditioned things, arising, duration-and-change, and death.
śūnyatānātmaśunyataḥ / pravartate	Emptiness has the aspects of emptiness and non-self.
anātmaśūnyatākārābhyāṃ saṃprayuktaḥ śūnyatāsamādhidvarcyākāraḥ /	The absorption associated with the two aspects of emptiness and of non-self is called the absorption of emptiness. There are thus two aspects, the last two aspects of the Truth of Suffering.
apraṇihitaḥ satyākārairataḥ paraiḥ //	The absence of intention is associated with the other Truths.
paraiḥ śeṣaiḥ satyākāraiḥ saṃprayuktaḥ samādhipraṇihito daśākāraḥ /	The absorption of the absence of intention is the absorption that grasps the other ten aspects.
anityaduḥkhataddhetubhya udvegāt mārgasya ca kolopamatayā 'vaśyatyājyatvāttadākāraḥ samādhirapraṇihitaḥ /	On the one hand, there are aspects of impermanence and suffering (duhkha, the first two aspects of the Truth of Suffering) and the four aspects of the Truth of Origin, which provoke dread, and on the other hand, the four aspects of the Path, for the Path is like a raft and should necessarily be. The absorption that grasps these ten aspects is turned toward the passing beyond of things that are impermanent, suffering, arising, and the Path; it is then called apraṇihita, free from praṇidhāna, the will or desire for something. On the contrary however, Nirvāṇa, under these four aspects and as the object of the absorption of the absence of intention, should not be abandoned;
tadatikramābhimukhatvāt śūnyatānātmatābhyāṃ tu nodvego nirvāṇasāmānyāt /	and the last two aspects of the Truth of Suffering, namely emptiness and non-self, the object of the absorption of emptiness, do not provoke dread, for these two aspects belong to Nirvāṇa as well as to conditioned things.
ta ete trayaḥ samādhayo dvividhāḥ /	These three absorptions are of two types.
śuddhāmalāḥ	Pure or immaculate.
śuddhakāścānāsravāśca / laukikalokottaratvāt /	They are pure or immaculate, that is undefiled, accordingly as they are worldly or transworldly.
laukikā ekādaśasu bhūmiṣu /	Worldly, they exist in eleven spheres;
lokottarā yatra mārgaḥ /	transworldly, they exist in the sphere of the Path.
nirmalāstu te vimokṣamukhatrayam / anāsravāstvete trayaḥ samādhayastrīṇi vimokṣamukhānyucyante /	Immaculate, they are the three gates to deliverance. When they are undefiled, they are also called “the gates to”.
śūnyatā vimokṣamukhamapraṇihitamānimittaṃ vimokṣamukhamiti / mokṣadvāratvāt /	We have emptiness as a gate to deliverance, the absence of characteristics as a gate to deliverance, and the absence of intention as a gate to deliverance.
punaścocyante / śūnyatāśūnyatādyākhyāstrayo 'parasamādhayaḥ // śūnyatāśūnyatā apraṇihitāpraṇihitaḥ ānimittānimittaśca / śūnyatādyālambanatvāttannāma /	There are also three other absorptions called "emptiness of emptiness", etc. They are also called the absorption of the emptiness of emptiness, the absorption of the absence of intention in the absence of intention, and the absorption of the absence of characteristics in the absence of characteristics, because they have respectively, and in a manner that we shall explain, the absorptions of emptiness, the absence of intention, and the absence of characteristics for their objects.
teṣāṃ punaḥ ālambete akṣaikṣaṃ dvau śūnyataścāpyanityataḥ /	The first two refer to the Aśaikṣa under the aspects of emptiness and impermaṇence.
aśaikṣaṃ samādhiṃ dvāvaparasamādhī ālambete /	They have for their object the absorption of the Aśaikṣa; that is, they have respectively the absorption of emptiness and the absorption of the absence of intention as realized by an Arhat for.
śūnyatāśūnyatā aśaikṣaṃ śūnyatāsamādhimālambate śūnyatākāreṇa /	The absorption of the emptiness of emptiness considers the absorption of emptiness, which considers the dharmas as empty and non-self, as empty but not as non-self, because a view of non-self does not provoke the same dread as does a view of emptiness.
apraṇihitāpraṇihito 'pyaśaikṣamapraṇihitamanityākāreṇa /	The absorption of the absence of intention in the absence of intention has the absorption of the absence of intention of the Aśaikṣa for its object, an absorption which considers things under ten aspects, impermanence, suffering, etc. , by considering them as impermanent.
na duḥkhato na hetvādito 'nāsravasyātallakṣaṇatvānna mārgākāraiḥ dūṣaṇīyatvāt /	It does not consider them as suffering, nor as cause, origin, condition, or appearance, for the absorption of the absence of intention, being undefiled, is not suffering or cause; and although the absorption of the absence of intention is the Path, the absorption of the absence of intention in the absence of intention no longer considers it as a Path, the truth, the route, nor as pertaining to the truth, because the goal pursued by the ascetic is that of becoming disgusted with the absorption of the.
ānimittānimittastu śāntato'saṃkhyayā kṣayam //	The absence of characteristics in the absence of characteristics has for its object extinction not attained through conscious effort, and considers it as tranquil.
ānimittānimittastu samādhiraśaikṣasyānimittasyāpratisaṃkhyānirodhamālambate / śāntākāreṇa /	This is to say that the absorption of the absence of characteristics in the absence of characteristics has for its object the extinction that is not attained through conscious effort of the absorption of the absence of characteristics, and considers this extinction under the aspect of tranquility, thinking, “This extinction is tranquil”.
anāsravasya pratisaṃkhayānirodhābhāvāt / na nirodhapraṇītaniḥsaraṇākārairanityatānirodhasādhāraṇatvādavyākṛtatvā davisaṃyogācca / ekāntena caite parasamādhayaḥ sāsravāḥ	It does not have for its object the extinction attained through conscious effort of the absorption of the absence of characteristics, for this absorption is undefiled, and there is no extinction attained through conscious effort of anything that is pure. And of the four aspects under which one can consider extinction attained through conscious effort, namely extinction, tranquility, excellent, and leaving, the aspect of tranquility is the only one that. In fact, the characteristic of extinction belongs to the extinction not attained through conscious effort, as well as to the extinction brought about by impermanence;
āryamārgadveṣitvāt nahyevamanāsravā iti /	the extinction not attained through conscious effort is not excellent, for it is morally neutral; it is not leaving, for it is not disconnection from the defilements. The three absorptions are exclusively Defiled. Because they hate the Path, they turn away from it, regarding it as empty, etc. Now such absorptions are not pure, or undefiled dharmas.
kutrotpadyante /	Where do they arise?
nṛṣu	Among humans.
manuṣyeṣveva na deveṣu /	They are cultivated only by humans of the Three Dvīpas, and not by the gods.
kasyotpadyante /	Among whom do they arise?
akopyasya	Among the Unshakeable Ones.
nānyasyārhataḥ /	Only among the Arhats of the Unshakeable class, and among no other Aṛhats.
katibhūmikāḥ /	In what sphere do these also exist?
saptasāmantavarjitāḥ /	With the exception of the seven sāmantakas.
sapta sāmantakāni hitvānyāsvekādaśasu bhūmiṣu / kāmadhātvanāgamyadhyānāntaradhyānārupyeṣu / punaścatasraḥ samādhibhāvanā ucyante /	These absorptions arise eleven spheres, namely Kāmadhātu, Anāgamya, the eight basic absorptions (Dhyāna and Ārūpya absorptions, with the exception of the.
asti samādhibhāvanā āsevitā bhāvitā vahulīkṛtā dṛṣṭadharmasukhavihārāya saṃvartate” iti vistaraḥ /	The Sutra says that there are four cultivations of absorption: "There is a cultivation of the absorption that cultivates, practices, repeatedly cultivates, which has for its result the possession of happiness in this world," and the rest.
tatra samādhibhāvanā dhyānaṃ śubhamādyaṃ sukhāya hi //	The First good Dhyana is the cultivation of the absorption that has for its result happiness; (the supernormal knowledge of the eye has sight for its result; the cultivation of good arisen from exercise has comprehension for its result; the absorption likened to a Vajra of the Fourth Dhyana has the extinction of the defilements for its result.
kuśalaṃ prathamaṃ śuddhakamanāsravaṃ vā dṛṣṭadharmasukhavihārāya samādhibhāvanā /	) The "First good Dhyana" is the first pure or undefiled dhyana. Through this dhyana, the ascetic obtains "happiness in this world".
tadādikatvādanyānyapi jñeyāni /	This holds for the other three Dhyanas as for the First Dhyana.
nāvaśyaṃ saṃparāyasukhavihārāyāparihiṇordhvopapannaparinirvṛtānāṃ tadabhāvāt /	This absorption does not necessarily have for its result happiness beyond this world, for the ascetic who possesses it can fall from it, he can be reborn higher, or he can obtain Nirvana: inThese three cases he does not enjoy happiness in a future life.
darśanāyākṣyabhijñeṣṭā	The supernormal knowledge of the eye has sight for its result.
divyacakṣurabhijñā jñānadarśanāya samādhibhāvanā /	The second cultivation of the absorption has for its result the acquisition of the seeing of knowledge. This is the supernormal knowledge of the divine eye.
dhībhedāya prayogajāḥ /	The cultivation of good arisen from exercise has comprehension for its result. The third cultivation of the absorption has for its result the attainment of the excellent forms of prajñā.
prayogajāḥ sarve guṇāstraidhātukā anāsravāḥ prajñāprabhedāya samādhibhāvanā /	This is the samādhihāvanā of the superior qualities which arise from cultivation, that is, the qualities of the three spheres and pure, undefiled qualities. The samādhi that produces these qualities is called the samādhibhāvanā of these qualities.
vajropamo'ntye yo dhyāne sāsravakṣayabhāvanā //	The absorption likened to a Vájra of the Fourth Dhyāna has the extinction of the defilements for its result.
yaścaturthadhyāne vajropamaḥ samādhiḥ sa āsravakṣayāya samādhibhāvanā /	In the Fourth Dhyāṇna there is produced an absorption that is called the cultivation "like a Vajra". This absorption destroys all of the defilements.
ātmopanāyikī kilaiṣā bhagavato dharmadeśanā / ataścaturbhya evāha /	According to the School, the Blessed One, in setting forth this fourfold cultivation of the absorptions, teaches his own cultivation. How is this? Because he places himself in the Fourth Dhyāna in order to realize the Vajropamasamādhi which, as we have seen, can be realized in other states of absorption.
kṛtaḥ samādhīnāṃ kālagato nirdeśaḥ /	We have explained the absorptions.
idānīṃ samādhisaṃniśritānāṃ guṇānāṃ nirdeśakāla iti vyākhyāyante	Let us explain the qualities that the ascetic realizes by being in the absorptions.
apramāṇāni catvāri	The Immeasurables are four in number.
maitrī karuṇā muditopekṣā ca /	They are goodwill or friendship, compassion, joy, and equanimity.
apramāṇasattvālambanatvāt / kimarthaṃ catvāryeva /	They are called the Immeasurables because they apply to an immeasurable number of beings, drawing after them an immeasurable merit, and producing immeasurable results.
vyāpādādivipakṣataḥ /	Because they oppose ill-will, etc. ,
vyāpādaviṃhisā 'ratikāmarāgavyāpādabahulānāṃ tatprahāṇāya catvāri yathāsaṃkhyam /	In order the four Immeasurables oppose ill-will, harm, dissatisfaction, and sensual craving and hostility. Goodwill causes persons who are given over to ill-will to abandon ill-will, and so on. We have seen that the meditation on loathsome things. we learn here that equanimity also opposes it.
aśubhopekṣayoḥ kāmarāgapratipakṣatve ko viśeṣaḥ /	What is the difference between the meditation on loathsome things and equanimity in their opposition to sensual craving?
varṇarāgasyāśubhā maithunarāgasyopekṣeti vaibhāṣikāḥ /	According to the Vibhāṣā, there is reason to distinguish, with respect to sensual craving, craving for the visible things of Kāmadhātu, and sexual craving. Now meditation on loathsome things opposes the first of these two craving, whereas equanimity is opposed to the second.
evaṃ tu yujyate / maithūnarāgasyāśubhā mātāpitṛputrajñātirāgasyopekṣeti / tatra	We would say rather that meditation on loathsome things is opposed to sexual craving, whereas equanimity is opposed to craving that has for its object father, mother, children, and parents.
maitryadveṣaḥ	Goodwill is the absence of hatred.
adveṣasvabhāvā maitrī	The nature of goodwill is the absence of malice.
api karuṇā karuṇāpyevam / muditā sumanaskatā //	This is also the case for compassion.
saumanasyasvabhāvā muditā / upekṣā 'lobhaḥ	The nature of joy is satisfaction.
alobhātmikopekṣā /	The nature of equanimity is the absence of desire.
kathaṃ vyāpādapratipakṣaḥ /	how can it oppose ill-will?
tasya lobhākṛṣṭatvāt /	Because ill-will is provoked by desire.
ubhayasvabhāvā tvasau yujyate /	We would say rather that equanimity is both the absence of desire and the absence of ill-will.
eṣāṃ tu maitryādīnāṃ ākāraḥ sukhitā duḥkhitā vata /	Their aspects are happiness, unhappiness, joy, and beings.
modantāmiti sattvāśca	Happy beings are the object of goodwill.
sukhitā vata sattvā iti manasikurvan maitrīṃ samāpadyate /	The ascetic produces with regard to them a mind having the following aspect, “Beings are happy! ” and by this, he enters the meditation of goodwill. Suffering beings are the object of meditation.
duḥkhitā vata sattvā iti karuṇāṃ modantāṃ vata sattvā iti muditāṃ sattvā ityeva manasi kurvannupekṣāṃ samāpadyate / mādhyasthyāt / atadvatāṃ sukhādhimokṣatvāt kathaṃ na viparītatvaṃ bhavati /	With regard to them the ascetic thinks, “Beings are unhappy! ” and, by this, he enters the meditation of compassion. Joyful beings are the object of joy. With regard to them, the ascetic thinks, “Beings are joyful! ” and, by this, he enters into the meditation of joy.
santvityabhiprāyāt /	Beings considered merely as beings and without making any. With regard to them the ascetic produces a mind having the following aspect, “Beings!
āśayasyāviparītatvādvā 'dhimuktisaṃjñānāt /	” and, by this, by means of what can be called “impartiality”, he enters into the meditation of equanimity. Yet, to consider the beings who do not possess happiness as happy is an intentional view not conforming to the facts, and is erroneous. it is not erroneous: when the ascetic thinks, “Beings are happy! ” the sense is “May beings be happy!” There is no error in his intention, for the ascetic indeed knows that he conceives an intentional view.
athavā ka evaṃ viparītatve doṣaḥ /	And even though the ascetic himself is mistaken, what harm is there in that?
akuśalatvamiti cet /	Would you say that the Immeasurables are bad because they take beings as they are not?
na kuśalamūlatvādvyāpādādipratipakṣatvācca / ukta eṣāmākāraḥ /	But they are the roots of good since they oppose ill-will, etc. The Immeasurables have living beings for their object.
kāmasattvāstu gocaraḥ // kāmāvacarāḥ sattvā eṣāmālambanam /	More precisely, they have the living beings of Kāmadhātu for their sphere.
tadālambanānāṃ vyāpādādīnāṃ pratipakṣatvāt / yattūktamekāṃ diśamadhimucyeteti tadbhājanena bhājanagataṃ darśitam /	In fact, they oppose ill-will with respect to these beings. The Sūtra speaks of the physical world but it has in view the beings that are to be found in the physical world.
katibhūmikānyetāni /	In what spheres does the ascetic produce the Immeasurables?
dhyānayormuditā prathamadvitīyadhyānayormuditā /	Joy in two Dhyānas.
saumanasyatvāt /	One cultivates joy in only the first two Dhyāṇas, for joy is satisfaction and satisfaction is absent in the other Dhyāṇas.

kecittu pañcasu /	Or, according to some, in five.

daśasvityapare / kāmadhātuṃ sāmantakāni ca prakṣipya samāhitāsamāhitamaulalprayogagrahaṇāt /	According to still other masters, they exist in ten spheres, by adding to the six Kāmadhātu and the three sāman:akas of the higher Dhyānas. The number varies accordingly as one attributes the Immeasurables to a state of non-absorption.
yaduktaṃ “vyāpādādivipakṣata” iti kimapramāṇairapi kleśagrahaṇaṃ bhavati /	We have said that the Immeasurables oppose ill-will, etc. Does this mean that one could abandon the defilements by means of the Immeasurables?
na taiḥ prahāṇaṃ mauladhyānabhūmikatvādadhimuktimanaskāratvātsattvālambanatvācca /	There is no abandoning through the Immeasurables. For the Immeasurables have the basic Dhyanas for their sphere or places of their arising; because they include an arbitrary or voluntary judgment and not an exact judgment; and because they have for their object living beings and not the general characteristics of things.
tatprayogeṇa tu vyāpādādiviṣkambhaṇāttatpratipakṣatvamuktam /	However, in their preparatory stage, the Immeasurables disturb ill-will, etc. , and the Immeasurables dispel ill-will already abandoned: this is why we have said above that the Immeasurables oppose ill-will, etc. More specifically: goodwill, compassion, etc. , cultivated in Kamadhatu and in Anagamya, the preliminary stages, only resemble goodwill, compassion, etc. in a state of.

taistānviṣkambhya prahāṇamārgaiḥ prajahāti / tato vītarāgāvasthāyāṃ maulāpramāṇalābhāt /	—by which he abandons the defilements. Once the defilements are abandoned, the ascetic obtains detachment from Kāmadhātu, enters the basic Dhyāna, and then obtains the Four Immeasurables of the sphere of the basic Dhyāna.
balavatpratyayalābhe 'pi tairanādhṛṣyo bhavati /	The defilements are thus dispelled, and made distant, and the ascetic will henceforth be invincible, even when he encounters powerful causes of defilement.
kathaṃ punarādikarmiko maitryāṃ prayujyate /	How does the beginner cultivate goodwill?
yathā sukhitamātmānaṃ manyate parānvā śṛṇoti buddhabodhisattvāryaśrāvakāṃstathā sattvānāṃ tatsukhamadhimucyate evaṃ sukhitā vata santu sattvā iti /	He calls to mind the happiness that he himself has experienced; he hears one speak of the happiness experienced by others, by the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas, the Śrāvakas, and the Pratyekabuddhas. He forms the vow that all beings shall obtain this happiness.

To think thus is to confess that fuel is termed hot although.
nāstyanyatve doṣaḥ /	The Vātsīputrīyas are thus justified in saying that “fire is not different from fuel since fuel is hot.” Wood on fire is called fuel;

But the relationship of the pudgala with physical matter, be it identical or different, is inexpressible.

notsahiṣyate pudgalaṃ vijñātuṃ śabdādivat /	In the first hypothesis, one cannot maintain that this eye consciousness perceives the pudgala, because the pudgala is not the object of this consciousness, as neither is sound. In fact, all consciousnesses that are produced having as their condition a certain thing, has this same thing as an "object as condition"; now the pudgala, not being a condition of the eye consciousness, cannot be its object. Thus the visual consciousness does not perceive the pudgala.

atha pudgalo na tasyālambanaṃ na tarhi tena vijñeyaḥ /	We admit then that the pudgala is not an object as condition of consciousness. Very well; but then it is not discernible, an object of vijnana; if it is not discernible, it is not cognizable, the object of jnana; if it is not cognizable, how can one prove that it exists? If one cannot prove that it exists, your system collapses.
yadi ca pudgalaḥ ṣaḍvijñānavijñeyaḥ pratijñāyate /	You have said that the pudgala is discerned by the six consciousnesses.

yacca tatkevalaṃ mana ādhipatyādhyākṛtaṃ manovijñānaṃ naivaṃ tadanyeṣāṃ viṣayamākāṅkṣatyato nāstyeṣa doṣaḥ /	By this fact, the mental consciousness which is isolated—that is to say, which is not induced and dominated by one of the five material organs, but solely by the mental organ—does not have any desire with regard to the spheres and objects of the five organs, but solely with regard to the dharmāyatana. Thus the Ṣatprāṇakopama-sūtra does not contradict the Śūtra previously quoted.

tathoktaṃ “pañcādīnavā ātmopalambhe / ātmadṛṣṭirbhavati sattvadṛṣṭiḥ /	The Sūtra says, “Five calamnities proceed from the belief in a soul: one creates a theory of the soul, of a being, of a vital principal;

yo hi granthaḥ sarveṣu nikāyāntareṣvāmnāyate na ca sūtraṃ dharmatāṃ vā bādhate so 'smābhirapāṭhānna buddhavacanamiti vacanaṃ kevalaṃ sāhasamātram	Because all the other traditions read these texts, and because these texts do not contradict any other Sūtras, nor philosophic truths. Also, when you embolden yourself to brutally reject them by saying, “They are not authentic because we do not read them,” this is only pure impudence contrary to all good sense.
kiṃ cedamapi teṣāṃ sūtraṃ nāsti “sarvadharmā anātāna” iti / syāt matam /	The position of the Vātsīputrīyas is moreover more inadmissable since their sect reads a Sūtra which says, “The dharmas are notWithout doubt we read this Sūtra.
naiva hi pudgalo dharma ucyate nāpyanyo dharmāditi /	But the pudgala is neither the dharmas which serve as its support, nor is it different from these dharmas; that is why it says that "no dharma is a soul. " Very well;
evaṃ tarhi na manovijñeyaḥ sidhyati / dvayaṃ pratītya vijñānasyotpādaḥ ityavadhāraṇāt /	but it is taught that the pudgala cannot be discerned by the mental consciousness, since the Sūtra establishes clearly that the mental consciousness is produced by reason of two conditions, the mental organ and the dharmas.
iha caivaṃ vikalpyate “anātmanyāteti saṃjñāviparyāsa ścittaviparyāso dṛṣṭiviparyāsa” iti /	Besides how would you explain the Sūtra which says, "To recognize a soul in what is not soul is a mistake of ideas, of mind, and of view"?
anātmanyātmeti viparyāso na tvātmani kiṃ ca punaḥ /	This Sūtra says that it is a mistake to recognize a soul in that which is not a soul;
“nātmā skandhāyatanadhātavaḥ” yattāvaduktaṃ prāk “no tu vaktavyaṃ rūpāṇi vā no ve“ti tattāvadaśocam /	it does not say that it is a mistake to recognize a soul in what is a soul. What is understood by "that which is not a soul"? Would you say that it concerns the skandhas, āyatanas and dhāṭus? This contradicts your theory that the pudgala is not identical to physical matter, etc. Furṟther, a Sūtra says, "Oh Bhikṣus, know that all.
uktaṃ ca sūtrāntare “ye kecit bhikṣavaḥ śramaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā ātmeti samanupaśyantaḥ samanupaśyanti sarve ta imāneva pañcopādānaskandhāni“ti	the Brāhmins and monks that contemplate a soul, contemplate only the five skandhas-of-attachment.”
tasmātsarva evānātmanyātmagrāhaḥ /	Then this is not a soul, because the self that one recognizes as a soul is solely the dharmas that are not a soul but which one falsely imagines to be a soul.

But the same Sūtra says, “In the past, I was handsome .
evamanekavidhaṃ ye samanusmarantīti pradarśayati /	* This declaration is for the purpose of indicating that the saint capable of recollecting his past lives remembers the variety of characteristics of his series of these existences.
yadi tu rūpavantaṃ pudgalaṃ paśyetsatkāyadṛṣṭiprasaṅgaḥ syāt /	But the Buddha does not mean that he sees a real pudgala possessing, in a past life, such physical matter, etc. : for to think such is to fall into satkāyadr̥ṣṭi. Oṟ rather, if such is the meaning of this sentence, then its sole purpose is to reject it as non-authentic. We concludethat the Sūtra, insofar as it attributes the possession of physical matter, etc. , to a soul, has in view "a self of designation", as one speaks of a pile which, being only an accumulation, has no unity; or of a current of water which being only an accumulation, has no unity;
apāṭha eva tvanna śaraṇaṃ syāt / tasmāt prajñāptisatpudgalo rāśidhārāvat /	or of a current of water which, being only a succession of waters, has no permanence.
yadyevaṃ tarhi na buddhaḥ sarvajñaḥ prapnoti / na hi kiñcictrittamasti caittā vā yatsarvaṃ jānīyāt / kṣaṇikatvāt /	The Blessed One would then not be omniscient, since the mind and mental states are not capable of knowing all the dharmas, seeing that mind and mental states change, arising and perishing from moment to moment.
pudgalastu jānīyāt /	Omniscience can belong only to a soul, a pudgala.
evaṃ tarhi cittavināśe pudgalasyāvināśābhyupagamāt nityatvamasyābhyupetaṃ bhavati /	We would reply that the pudgala would be eternal if it does not perish when the mind perishes: a thesis which contradicts your theory of a pudgala about which one can only say that it is eternal or non-eternal.
naiva ca vayaṃ sarvatra jñānasaṃmukhībhāvād buddhaṃ sarvajñamācakṣmahe / kiṃ tarhi / sāmarthyāt	We do not say that the Buddha is omniscient in the sense that he knows all the dharmas at one and the same time: "Buddha" designates a certain series: toThis series there belongs this unique ability that, by a single act of modulating his mind, he immediately produces an exact consciousness of the object relative to which a desire for knowing has arisen: one then calls this series “Omniscient.” One moment of thought is not capable of knowing everything.

tathā sarvavideṣṭavyo 'sakṛtsarvasya vedanāt / kathamidaṃ gamyate /	How do you prove that the word “Omniscient” should be understood as a series, and not as a particular self of universal knowledge?

skandhā eva ca traiyadhvikā iṣyante na pudgalā yuṣmābhiḥ /	But, in your system, the rkandhas of existence belong to the three periods of time, but not the pzdágala.
yadi skandhā eva pudgalāḥ kasmādidamāha / “bhāraṃ ca vo bhikṣavo deśayiṣyāmi bhārādānaṃ ca bhāranikṣepaṇaṃ ca bhārahāraṃ ce“ti /	If the term pugala only designates the five rkandhas-of-attachment, how can the Blessed One say, “OhBhikshus, I shall explain to you the burden, the taking up of the burden, the laying down of the burden, and the bearer of the burden.
kasmādidaṃ na vaktavyaṃ syāt /	Why may it not be explained in these terms?
na hi bhāra eva bhārahāro yuktaḥ /	Because, if the pudgala is only a name given to the rekandhas, it cannot be the bearer of a burden.
kiṃ kāraṇam /	Why not?
nahyevaṃ dṛśyata iti /	Simply because it is unheard of.
avaktavyo 'pi na yuktaḥ / kiṃ kāraṇam /	Do not speak then of an ineffable pudgala.
na hyevaṃ dṛśyate /	No one has ever ascertained the existence of an ineffable thing. And moreover you will have to account for the other statements of the Sutra that thirst is the taking up of the burden: as thirst is a skandha, the "burden", and it is unheard of that a burden takes itself up.
bhārādānasyāpi skandhāsaṃgrahaprasaṅgācca /	The "taking up of the burden" is included within the rkandhas, and so too the bearer of the burden.
ityarthameva bhārahāraṃ nirdideśa bhagavān /	These are the skandhas that the Blessed One designated by the name of "pudgala, the bearer of the burden," as one sees in the explanation given a little farther on in the same Sutra. After having said that the burden is the five rkandhas-of-attachment, that the taking up of the burden is thirst, and that the. Laying down of the burden is the abandoning of thirst, it is said that the bearer of the burden is the pxdgala;
“yo 'sāvāyupmānevaṃnāmā yāvadevañcirasthitika evamāyuḥparyantaḥ” sa eṣa yathā vijñāyeta / mānyathā vijñāyi nityo vā avaktavyaṃ veti /	but fearing that one understands the pudágala inexactly, as an eteṟrnal, ineffable, real entity, he explains, “(It is only to conform to the use of this world that one says:) This venerable one, of such a name, of such a gotra,” and the rest, in order that one might well know that the pudgala is effable, impermanent, and without a unique pnature. The five skandhas-of-attachmeṇt are painful in their nature: they receive then the name of “burden”;
skandhā eva ca skandhānāmupadhātāya saṃvartante pūrvakā uttareṣāmiti bhāraṃ ca bhārahāraṃ ca kṛtvoktāḥ / upaghātārtho hi bhāra iti /	each of the former moments of the series attract each of the latter moments: it receives then the name of ““bearer of the burden.
asty eva pudgalo yasmād uktaṃ “nāsti sattva upapāduka iti mithyādṛṣṭiḥ” /	” The pudgala is then not an entity. The pudgala exists as the Sūtra says, “To say that apparitional beings do not exist is a false view.
kaścaivam āha nāsti sattva upapāduka iti /	” Who denies the existence of apparitional beings?
sattvastu yathā 'sti tathā vibhakto bhagavateti brūmo mānuṣyakasūtre /	We admit the existence of these beings in the sense that the Blessed One understands them.
tasmād yaḥ paratropapādukasattvākhyaskandhasaṃtānāpavādaṃ karoti tasyaiṣā mithyādṛṣṭir nāsti sattva upapāduka iti /	For him, “apparitional beings” designates a. Susceptible of going to another world without the intervention of a womb, an egg, or of moisture forms of birth.
skandhānām upapādukatvāt /	To negate the existence of an apparitional being so defined, is a false view, because this type of series of skandhas truly exists.
athaiṣā mithyādṛṣṭiḥ pudgalāpavādikā satī kiṃprahātavyā bhavet /	If you maintain that the negation of the pudgala is false, you will have to say how this false view is given up.
nahyeṣā darśanabhāvanāprahātavyā yujyate / pudgalasya sattveṣvantarbhāvāt /	It cannot be given up by Seeing, nor by Meditation, for on the one hand, the pudgala is not included within the Truths, and, on the other hand, false views are not given up by Meditation but by Seeing.
“ekaḥ pudgalo loka utpadyamāna utpadyate” iti vacanāt na skandhā iti cet /  na /	But a Sutra says, 'A pudgala arises in this world. ' Now this does not refer to the five skandhas, but to an entity. Such is not the meaning of the Sutra that only metaphorically designates as a unit that which exists only as a complex;
samudāye 'pyekopacārādekatilaikataṇḍulavat ekarāśyekavacanavacca /	as the world speaks of a grain of hemp, or a grain of rice, or of a heap, or a word. Further, since the Sutra attributes an arising to the.
saṃskṛta iti vā pudgalo vaktavya utpatīmattvābhyupagamāt / na sa evamutpadyate yathā skandhā apūrvaprādurbhāvāt / kiṃ tarhi /	When it refers to the pudgala, the word “to arise” does not have the same meaning as when one speaks of the skandhas arising.
skandhāntaropādānāt /	For the skandhas, to arise means to exist after having been non-existent. One says that the pudgala arises because, at that moment, it takes on different sbkandhas (for example the anas of a human instead of the manas of an animal).
yathā yājñiko jāto vaiyākaraṇo jāta ityucyate vidyopādānāt /	As one says in the world, when a certain person acquires a certain knowledge, that a sacrificer, or a grammarian is born;
bhikṣurjātaḥ parivrājako jāta iti liṅgopādānāt /	when a layman takes on certain characteristics, one says that a bhiks, a monk of a certain sect is born: one does not mean by these expressions that there has really been a birth of a sacrificer, or a monk.
buddhojāto vyādhito jāta ityavasthāntaropādānāditi /	And again in the same way, through the acquisition of a certain trait, one says: an old man is born, a sick person comes into being. This explanation of the phrase, 'A pudgala arises in this world' has been condemned by the Blessed One.
na pratikṣepāt sūtra eva hi pratikṣiptaṃ bhagavatā paramārthaśūnyatāyām / “iti hibhikṣavo 'sti karmāsti vipākaḥ kārakastu nopalabhyate / ya imāṃśca skandhānnikṣipati anyāṃśca skandhān pratisaṃdadhātyanyatra dharmasaṃketāditi /	In the Paramārthafūnyata-sūtra, the Blessed One said, “There is action;
phalgusūtre coktam “upādatta iti phalgu na vadāmīti /	there is. ”And in the Phālgṇunṇa-sūtra: 'I do not say that there has been one who takes.
tasmānnāsti skandhānāṃ kaścidupādātā nāpi nikṣiptā /	' There is then no pudgala that gives up or takes up the skandhas.
kaṃ ca tāvadbhavānyājñikaṃ yāvadvacyā dhita madhimucyate /	Nevertheless, let us examine your examples: 'A sacrificer is born. ' What is the nature of that which became a sacrificer?
dṛṣṭātaṃ karoti pudgalaṃ yadi /	Would you say that a 'soul' became a sacrificer? But you have to precisely prove the existence of a 'soul.
so 'siddhaḥ /	' Would you say that it is a series of minds and mental states?
atha cittacaittāḥ / na / teṣāṃ pratikṣaṇamapūrvotpattireva /	But minds and mental states appear from instant to instant after having been non-existent and they are not capable of abandoning and grasping.
atha śarīram /	Would you say that it is the body?
tasyāpi tathā /	The same difficulty holds. Notice then that the knowledge the acquisition of which by a so-called person makes him a sacrificer, differs from this person.
śarīravidyāliṅgavacca skandhapudgalayoranyatvamāpadyate / jīrṇa śarīrāntarameva jyādhitaṃ ca /	it would be then, by a legitimate comparison, that the skandhas acquired by a pxdgala differ from the pudgala;
pratiṣiddho hi sāṃkhyīyaḥ pariṇāmavādaḥ /	and this goes against your definition of a pxdgala. As for the example of an old man and a sick person, there is a succession of different bodies: to hold that an old man is the transformation of a young man is the Sāṁkhya thesis of transformation, a thesis already refuted.
tasmādadṛṣṭāntā ete /	Then your examples are without value.
yadi ca skandhānāmapūrvotpādo na pudgalasyeṣyate so 'nyaśca tebhyo nityaśca sphuṭaṃ dīpito bhavati /	And if you say that the rkandhas arise, but that the pxdgala does not arise, it follows that the latter differs from the skandhas and is eternal.
pañca skandhā ekaḥ pudgala iti brūvatā kathamanyatvaṃ nocyate /	You maintain again that the skandhas are five in number, but that the pudgala is one: this is to again recognize that the pudgala differs from the skandhas. Your position is totally parallel, since you say that the primary elements, earth, etc. , are four; but that secondary matter—color, for example—is one;
kathaṃ tāvat bhūtāni catvāri rūpaṃ tvekaṃ na ca bhūtebhyyo 'nyadrūpam /	but that, nevertheless, secondary matter does not differ from the primary elements.
pākṣika eṣa doṣaḥ / katamasminpakṣa / bhūtamātrikapakṣe /	This objection does not go against us, but only against the.
tathāpi tu yathā bhūtamātraṃ rūpamevaṃ skandhamātraṃ pudgala ityabhyupetaṃ bhavati /	But, to adopt the opinion that you wrongly attribute to us, we say that in the manner that secondary matter is made up of the four elements, in that way the five skandhas constitute the pudgala.
yadi skandhamātraṃ pudgalaḥ kasmāt bhagavatā sa jīvastaccharīrakanyo veti navyākṛtam /	If the puágala is only a word serving to designate the five sēandhas, why did the Buddha not declare that the vital principal is the body?
praṣṭurāśayāpekṣayā /	Because the Buddha takes into consideration the intention of whomever asks him questions.
sa hi jīvadravyamekamantarvyāpāra puruṣamadhikṛtya pṛṣṭavān /	The person who asks this question of the Buddha understood by jṝva, not a being, a simple designation of the skandhas, but a person, a real living entity;
sa ca kasmiścinnāstīti kathamasyānyatvamananyatvaṃ vā vyākriyatām /	and he was thinking of this person when he asked if the jṝva is identical to the body or different from the body. Now this jṝva does not absolutely exist; and so the Buddha only maintained that it is neither identical to nor different from the body, and then the Blessed One condemned the two answers.
kaurmasyeva romṇo 'ntaḥkharatā mṛdutā vā / eṣa ca granthaḥ pūrvakaireva nirmocitaḥ /	In like manner one cannot say that the hairs of a tortoise are hard or soft.

evameva mahārāja sa eva jīvo nāsti kuto 'sya śarīrādanyatāmananyatāṃ vā vyākaromīti /	“In the same way, Oh King, the vital principal does not exist: one cannot then answer your question and say that it is identical to the body or different from the body.”
kasmāt bhagavatā 'pi noktaṃ nāstyeveti / praṣṭurāśayāpekṣayā /	But, if the pudágala does not exist, why didn’t the Blessed One answer that the ñāva absolutely does not exist?
sa hi yasyāpi skandhasaṃtānasya jīva ityākhyā tasyāpyabhāvaṃ pratīyāditi mithyādṛṣṭiṃ pātitaḥ syāt /	Because he took into consideration the intention of the questioner, that questioning on the jṝva may be with the idea that the jṝva is a series of skandhas. If the Blessed One answered that the jṝva absolutely does not exist, the questioner would have fallen into false views.
pratotya samutpādasyājñānāt /	Furthernore, as the questioner was not capable of understanding “dependent origination’”” ,he was not a fit receptacle for the Good Law: the Blessed Oṇe then did not tell him that the ṝāva exists except by way of designation.
sa cataddeśanāyā akṣamaḥ / itaścaitadevaṃ niścīyate /	The explanation that we have given here is the same that theI did not answer him.
yat bhagavatoktam “astyātmetyānanda vatsasagotrāya parivrājakāya praśnaṃ pṛṣṭo vyākuryāṃ nanvakalpaṃ syādvacanāya sarvadharmā anātmāna iti /	In fact, to answer that there is a soul is to contradict the truth of things, because no dharma is a soul nor has any relationship with a soul;

For, in comparison to the folly of the belief in the existence of a soul, this second folly is graver.
astyātmetyānanda śāśvatāya pareti /	Whoever believes in the soul falls into the extreme view of eternity;
nāstyātmetyānandocchedāya paretīti vistaraḥ / āha cānna	whoever believes that the soul does not exist falls into the extreme view of annihilation. Thoughtless error, heavy error…”, and so on. It has been said;
dṛṣṭidaṃṣṭrāvabhadaṃ ca braṃśaṃ cāpekṣya karmaṇām / deśayanti jinā dharma vyāgrīpītāpahāravat //	Taking into consideration the injury that heresy does and, also, the falling off of good deeds, the Buddhas teach the Law in the manner in which a tigress carries its young.

punarāha asattvādbhagavān jīvaṃ tattvānyatvena nāvadat /	And again: Since a real jṝva does not exist, the Buddha does not say that the jva is identical or non-identical;
nāstītyapi ca nāvocanmābhūt prājñaptikopyasan //	he does not say any more than that the jñva does not really exist, fearing that one would only negate the conventioṇal jṝva.
yatra hi skandhasaṃtāne śubhāśubhaphalāstitā / jīvākhyā tatra sā na syāt jīvanāstitvadeśanāt //	Series of skandhas, actions, and the results of actions are what are termed jṝva: if the Buddha were to negate the jṝva, he would negate actions and their results.
prajñaptimātraṃ skandhesu jīva ityapināvadat / abhavyaḥ śūnyatāṃ boddhuṃ tadānīṃ tādṛśo janaḥ //	And if the Buddha does not say that the so-called jñva is in the skandhas it is because he sees that the questioner is not capable of tolerating the teaching of emptiness.
tathā hyātmāsti nāstīti pṛṣṭo vāstyeva nāvadat /	It is then because of the state of mind of Vatsa that the Buddha, asked if there was a soul, yes or no, did not answer.
āśayāpekṣāyā praṣṭuḥ sati tvastīti nāha kim //	But if the soul were to exist, why wouldn’t he have answered that it exists?
śāśvatalokādīnāmapyavayākaraṇaṃ praṣṭurāśayāpekṣayā /	The Buddha did not answer four questions relative to the eteṟnity of the world: again this is because he took into account the incapacity of the questioner. Consideration the intention of the questioner.
yadi hi tāvadātmā loka iṣṭaḥ syāttasyābhāvādayuktaṃ caturdhā vyākaraṇam / atha sarva eva saṃsāro lokastasyāpyayuktam /	If such a person understands Joéka to be a soul, the four alternatives are incorrect, since the soul does not absolutely exist. If he understands oka to be transmigration or saṁsāra, the four alternatives are incorrect;
śāśvate loke na kasyacit parinirvāṇaṃ prāpnuyāt /	if transmigration is eternal, no one could obtain Nirvāṇa;
śāśvate loke na kasyacit parinirvāṇaṃ prāpnuyāt / aśāśvate sarvepāmucchedaḥ prāpnuyāt / ubhayathātve niyamata ekeṣāṃ parinirvāṇaṃ prāpnuyāt ekeṣāṃ na /	if it is not eternal, all would obtain Nirvana by spontaneous annihilation, and not through effort: if it is both eternal and non-eternal, some would never obtain Nirvāṇa, whereas others would obtain it spontaneously;
anubhayathātve naiva parinirvāṇaṃ nāparinirvāṇaṃ prāpnuyāt /	finally, to say that Joka, in the sense of sarṁsára, is neither eternal nor non-eternal, is to say that beings both would and would not obtain Nirvāṇa: a contradiction in terms.
ato mārgadhīnatvāt parinirvāṇasya caturdhāpi niyamo na vyākriyate nirgrantha4rāvakacaṭakavat /	In fact, Nirvāṇa is possible through the Way; then no categorical response is acceptable. In the same way the Buddha did not answer the Nirgranthaśrāvaka who held a bird in his hand and asked if this bird was dead or alive.
ata evāntavān loka iti catuṣkāvyākaraṇam / tulyārtho hyeṣa catuṣkaḥ /	The four questions as to whether the world is infinite, namelyif it has an end or not, has the same sense as the questions relative to the eternity of the world, and present the same defect.
tathāhi muktikaḥ parivrājaka eva catuṣkaṃ pṛṣṭvā punaḥ pṛṣṭavān kiṃ nu sarvo loko 'nena mārgeṇa niryātyāhosvidekadeśo lokasye“ti /	How do we know that "the infinity of the world" should be understood in this sense? The wandering monk Uktika, after having asked the Buddha about infinity, resorted to a ruse in order to repeat his question and asked, "Does the whole world obtain deliverance through the Way, or only a part of the world?
sthavira ānanda āha “yameva tvaṃ muktika tatprathamato bhagavantaṃ praśnaṃ pṛṣṭavāṃstame vaitarhi pṛcchasyanena paryāyeṇe“ti sarvam /	The elder Ānanda then said to him, "You have already posed this question, Uktika. Why do you repeat it by changing the terms?
bhavati tathāgataḥ paraṃ maranādityapi catuṣkaḥ praṣṭurāśayāpekṣayā na vyākṛtaḥ /	If the Blessed One did not explain concerning the four questions relative to the existence of the Tathāgata after death, this is again because he took into account the intentions of the questioner.
sa hi muktvāmānaṃ tathāgataṃ kṛtvā pṛṣṭavān /	Such a person understood the Tathāgata to be a "soul" liberated from the defilements.
paudgalikastu paryanuyojyaḥ kiṃ kāraṇaṃ bhagavān jīvantaṃ pudgalamastīti vyākaroti paraṃ maraṇānna vyākarotīti /	We ask in our turn those who hold to a "soul:" The Blessed One, according to you, declared that the pxdgala exists, indescribable: why did he not declare that the Tathāgata exists after death?
śāśvata doṣaprasaṅgaḥ / idaṃ tarhi kasmādvacyākaroti “bhaviṣyasi tvaṃ maitreyānāgate 'dhvani tathāgato 'rhan saṃyaksaṃbuddha” iti / kasmācca śrāvakamabhyatītaṃ kālagatamupapattau vyākarotyamuko 'mutropapanna iti /	If the Buddha kept silent on this point because he feared that the disciple, by admitting the survival of a pudgala named Tathāgata, would fall into the view of eternity, we would then ask why the Blessed One predicted to Maitreya, In the ages to come, you will be a Tathāgata, an Arhat, a Samyaksambuddha; and speaking of one of his deceased disciples, he said, He is at present reborn in such a place.
evamapi hi śāśvatatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	Are not these discourses defiled by the opinion of permanence? If we answer that the Blessed One does not say anything concerning the deceased Tathāgata because, seeing at first the pudgala, he now no longer sees the pudgala once it has attained Nirvana; it is then through ignorance that the Tathāgata does not make any declaration concerning the deceased Tathāgata, and to speak thus is to deny the omniscience of the Master. Rather one should believe that if the Blessed One abstains from all declarations, it is because the soul that the questioner alluded to in speaking of the Tathāgata does not absolutely exist.
yadi ca bhagavān pūrvaṃ pudgalaṃ dṛṣṭvā parinirvṛtaṃ punaḥ na paśyatyajñānānna vyakarotīti sarvajñatvaṃ śāsturutpāditaṃ bhavati na vā so 'stītyabhyupagantavyam	If the>Vatsiputriyas say that the Blessed One sees the pudgala, which is in Nirvana, but that he still does not make a statement on this subject;
atha paśyatyanucyamāno 'pyasāvasti śāśvataśceti siddhaṃ bhavati /	and that the pudgala exists but is not, at the same time, an object of a statement of the Blessed One, we then conclude that admit that the pudgala is permanent.
arthatadapi na vaktavyaṃ paśyati vā naveti / evaṃ tarhi idamapi śanaiḥ śanairavaktavyaṃ kriyatāṃ sarvajño vā na vā bhagavānna veti /	If say that "whether the Blessed One does or does not see the pudgala" is indescribable, they then proceed to say that all is indescribable, and that one can only say that the Blessed One is omniscient or non-omniscient.
astyeva pudgalo yasmātsatyataḥ sthitito nāsti me ātmeti dṛṣṭisthānamuktam / astītyapi dṛṣṭisthānamuktam /	The pudgala really exists, as it is said, that "To say that I really, truly do not have an aeman is an incorrect opinion.
tasmādajñāpakametat /	This is not a proof, for it is also said that it is an incorrect opinion to affirm the existence of an aemegn.
ubhayamapi tvetadantagrāhadṛṣṭi śāśvatocchedadṛṣṭisaṃgṛhītamityābhidharmikāḥ /	Scholars of the Abhidharma think that a belief in the existence of an aeman and a belief in its non-existence are two extreme opinions, as they identify them with the two branches of "the opinion that consists in believing in extremes.
tathaiva ca yuktam /	This doctrine is certain, as it is.
“astyātmetyānanda śāśvatāya paraiti nāstyātmetyānandocchedāya paraitī“ti vātsyasūtre vacanāt /	Ānanda, those who affirm a soul fall into the extreme of the belief in permanence; those who deny a soul fall into the extreme of the belief in annihilation.
yadi tarhi pudgalo nāsti ka eṣa saṃsarati /	If the pudgala does not exist, what is it that wanders in ra/sāra?
nahi saṃsāra eṣa saṃsaratīti yuktam /	In fact, one can only allow that sa/ṁsāra itself waṅders.
uktaṃ ca bhagavatā “avidyānivaraṇānāṃ sattvanāṃ saṃdhāvatāṃ saṃsaratāmi“ti /	Further the Blessed One has said, “Beings misled by ignorance, bound by thirst, wander here and there, either among beings in hell,among animals, among pretas, humans, or the gods; thus for a long time they experience all suffeṛing.
atha pudgalaḥ kathaṃ saṃsarati /	” How does the puvdgala wander in raṅsāra?
skandhāntaratyāgopādānāt /	Would you say that this wandering consists in abandoning old réandhas and in taking up new skandhas?
uktottara eṣa pakṣaḥ /	But we have shown that this explanation is inadmissable.
yathātu kṣaṇiko 'gniḥ saṃtatyā saṃsaratītyucyate tathā sattvākhyaḥ skndhasamudāyastṛṣṇopādānaḥ saṃsaratītyucyate /	A good explanation is simple: one says that when a flame burns a field it travels, although they be only moments of flame, because it constitutes a series; in the same way the harmony of the rkandhas which is constantly repeated receives, metaphorically, the name of being; supported by thirst, the series of skandhas.
yadi skandhāmātramidaṃ kasmādāha bhagavān “grahameva sa tena kālena tena samayena sunetro nāma śāstā 'bhūvami“ti / kasmānna vaktavyaṃ syāt /	If only the skandhas exist, we do not see how one can explain these words of the Blessed One, “In the past, I was the teacher Sunetra.
anyatvāt skandhānām /	” In fact, in the hypothesis of the existence of the individual reandhas metaphorically termed “soul,” past skandhas are not the same as present skandhas, and so the Blessed One cannot express himself in this manner.
atha kiṃ pudgalaḥ / sa evāsau /	But what is the thing that the Blessed One calls “soul"?
śāśvato hi syāt /	The pudgala, you would say: then, since the “soul” is permanent, a past “soul” is identical with a present “soul”.
tasmādahameva sa ityekasaṃtānatāṃ darśayati /	For us, when the Blessed One said, 'I was the teacher Sunetra,”' he teaches us that the skandhas that constitute his present “'soul’” formed part of the same series as the skandhas that constituted Sunetra.
yathā sa evāgnirdahannāgata iti /	In the same way one says, “This fire has been burning here. ” You affirm the existence of a real soul: we hold that only the Buddhas, Tathāgatas would see it.
yadi cātmā bhavettthāgatā eva suvyaktaṃ paśyeyuḥ /	But if the Buddhas see a soul, they would produce a firm belief in a soul; fromThis belief in a soul there would be produced among them a belief in things pertaining to a soul;
paśyatāṃ cātmagrāho dṛḍhataraḥ syādātmasnehaśca /	from these two beliefs there would be produced among them affection for the soul and for things pertaining to a soul. The Blessed One said in fact that “whosoever believes in a soul, believes in things pertaining to a soul;
“ātmani ca satyātmīyaṃ bhavatī“ti sūtre vacanādātmagrāho 'pyeṣāṃ skandheṣvadhikaṃ pravarteta /	believing in things pertaining to a soul, they become attached to the skandhas as they form a soul and things pertaining to a soul.”

atha mataṃ naivātmani pravartate sneha iti /	Affection is not produced with regard to a soul. We explain: when one recognizes a soul in what is not the soul, as do the non-Buddhists, one feels affection for this pretended soul;
tat ka idānīmeṣa yogo yadanātmanyātmadhimokṣāt sneha utpadyate ātmanyeva tu notpadyate /	but, when one sees the soul in that which is truly the soul, namely the ineffable pvdgala, as do the Buddhas, no affection is produced with regard to the soul. This statement has no support.

ye 'pi ca dravyāntaramevātmānaṃ manyante tīrthakārāstepāmeva mokṣābhāvadoṣo niṣkampaḥ /	non-Buddhists imagine a soul apart from all other substances. All these doctrines are wrong and present the same flaw in that they do not lead to liberation.
yadi tarhi sarvathāpi nāstyātmā kathaṃ kṣaṇikeṣu citteṣu cirānubhūtasyārthasya smaraṇaṃ bhavati pratyabhijñānaṃ vā /	If the soul does not absolutely exist, how can a mind—which perishes as soon as it is generated—be capable of remembering an object perceived a long time before? How is it able to recognize an object similar to what it has formerly perceived?
smṛtiviṣayasaṃjñānvayāccittaviśeṣāt /	Memory and recognition are generated immediately, in a series, from a certain type of mind, when this type of mind arises from the idea of object already perceived and which one calls “object of the memory.”

tādṛśo 'pi hyatadanvayaścittaviśeṣo na samarthaḥ tāṃ smṛtiṃ bhavayituṃ tadanvayo 'pi cānyādṛśo na samarthastāṃ smṛtiṃ bhavayitum /	We answer: It's a certain mind, bent towards the object of memory, a mind in which one finds ideas related to that thing or resembling that thing, or even “resolutions” of a certain. It is necessary that a bending of the mind be produced, an act of atteation, towards the object.
labhayathā tu samartha ityevaṃ smṛtirbhavatyanyasyāṃ sāmarthyādarśanāt /	It is necessary that the mind involves an idea resembling the object, in the case where one remembers by reason of resemblance (for example, I remember fire perceived a long time ago because the idea of fire is placed in my mind by the sight of present fire). Or it is necessary that the mind involves an idea in relation to the object, in the case where one remembers without there being resemblance (for example, I remember fire because the idea of smoke is placed in my mind by the sight of smoke). Or it is necessary that the mind involves a praṃidhāna, or resolution, an abhyāsa, oṟ habit (fot example, the resolution has been placed in the mental series, I shall remember.

na hi tayoḥ saṃbandho 'sti akārya kāraṇabhāvādyathaikasaṃtānikayoḥ /	There is no connection between Devadatta and Yajñadatta: Their minds are not in the relationship of cause and effect, as is the case for minds which form series.
na ca brūmo 'nyena cetasā dṛṣṭamanyatsmaratīti /	Indeed, we do not say that one mind sees an object and that another mind remembers this object, because these two minds belong to the same series. WeSay that one past mind, bearing a certain object, brings about the existence of another mind, the present mind, capable of remembering this object.
api tu darśanacittātsmṛticittamanyadutpadyate /	In other words, a mind of memory is generated from a mind of seeing, as fruit is generated from the seed through the force of the last stage of the transformation of the series.

smaratīti ko 'rthaḥ /	What do you understand by “to remember”?
smṛtyā viṣayaṃ gṛhlāti /	To grasp an object by the memory.
kiṃ tadgrahaṇamanyatsmaraṇāt /	Does “to grasp” differ from memory?
smṛtiṃ tarhi kaḥ karoti /	Memory is the agent of the action “to grasp.”
uktaḥ sa yastāṃ karoti smṛtihetucittaviśeṣaḥ /	We have explained what is the agent of this action: it is the cause of memory, namely a certain type of mind.
yattarhi caitraḥ smaratītyucyate /	But, if it is only a certain type of mind that is the cause of memory, how can one say that Caitra remembers? One gives the name Caitra to a series;
tato caitrākhyātsaṃtānāttāṃ bhavantīṃ dṛṣṭvocyate caitraḥ smaratīti /	a mind of memory is generated, in this series, from a mind of seeing, and by reason of this fact one says that Caitra remembers.

yathā kasya kaḥ svāmī /	What is the sense of the genitive "whose"? This genitive designates its master. Explain by an example how you understand that someone is the master of memory.
yathā goścaitraḥ /	As Caitra is the master of the cow.
kathamasau tasyāḥ svāmī /	In what is Caitra the master of the cow?
tadādhīno hi tasyā vāhadohādiṣu viniyogaḥ /	In that he directs and employs the cow as he pleases.
kva ca punaḥ smṛtirviniyoktavyā va evaṃ tasyāḥ svāmī mṛgyate /	To what then is the memory directed and employed by a master, for whom you search with great pains.
smartavye 'rthe /	It is directed and employed on the object that one wants to remember (that is to say, it is employed on remembering).
kimartha viniyoktavyā /	To what purpose?

kathaṃ ca viniyoktavyā /	Explain to me then how memory is employed: do you want to say that one transmits it to a certain place?
utpādanata ahosvitsaṃpreṣaṇataḥ /	Do you want to say that one causes it to be produced?
smṛtigatyayogādutpādanataḥ /	Memory does not die out; it is then not transmitted. One causes it to be produced.
hetureva tarhi svāmī prāpnoti phalameva ca svam /	What you call "master" is then simply the cause, and what you call "subject" is simply the result.
yasmāddhetorādhipatyaṃ phale phalena ca tadvān heturiti /	In fact theCause, by its command, operates the result; it is then "master'; and the result, in that it is subordinate to the cause at the moment of its arising, is called "subject. " Since the cause suffices as master, why require a self to which you could attribute memory?
yo hyeva hetuḥ smṛtestasyaivāsau /	Memory belongs to whatever causes memory.
yaścāpi sa caitrābhidhānaḥ saṃskārasamūhasaṃtāna ekato gṛhītvā gavākhyasvāmītyucyate	Complexes of saskāras, or the five skandhas forming a homogeneous series, are called "Caitra" and "cow.
sa cāpi tasya deśāntaravikārotpattau kāraṇabhāvaṃ cetasi kṛtvā na tu khalu kaścidekaścaitro	" One says that the Caitra-series possesses the cow-series, because the Caitra-series is the cause of the geographic displacement and the various changes of the cow-series.

To whom do we attribute consciousness? " and to other similar questions, "What feels, what makes ideas? " as we have responded to the questions, "What remembers? To whom do we attribute consciousness? " and to other similar questions, "What feels, what makes ideas?
yathā devadatto gacchatītyatra gatirbhāvo gantāraṃ devadattamapekṣate /	"Certain scholars say that the soul exists, as existence depends on an existing being, as the walking of Devadatta depends on Devadatta. Walking is an action, and Devadatta is the active being.
tathā vijñānaṃ bhāvaḥ / tasmādyo vijānāti tena bhavitavyamiti / sa vaktavyaḥ /	In the same way consciousness and all action depends on a "base of support," "one who knows," the agent.
ko 'yaṃ devadatta iti / yadyātmā sa eva sādhyaḥ / atha vyavahārapuruṣaḥ / so 'pi na kaścidekaḥ saṃskārā hi ta evaṃnāmānaḥ /	We would ask what it is that they understand by "Devadatta. " If they regard Devadatta as a real individual, we have discussed and refuted this theory. Devadatta is an imaginary individual and not an individual entity; Devadatta is only the name that one gives to the series of samskaras.
tatra yathā devadatto gacchati yathā vijānāti /	In the sense that one could say that such a Devadatta walks, in the same sense we can say that Devadatta knows.
kathaṃ ca devadatto gacchati /	How does Devadatta walk? "Devadatta" is only a homogeneous series of samskaras, moments of existence replaced without interruption and roughly similar one to another. The foolish see within this series an entity which would be the cause of the action.

sā ca deśāntaropattirgatirita /	the cause of this action—that is to say, the previous moment of the series—receives the name of “walker.”
jvālāśabdasaṃtānayorgacchatigamanābhidhānavat /	It is in this sense that we say that Devadatta walks, in order to designate a walk totally similar to that of fire or sound: the fire walks, the sound walks, that is to say, the fire-series and the sound-series go being generated from one place to another.
ta eva ca punarvijñānasya kāraṇaṃ bhavanta ucyante jānāti devadatta iti /	In the same way the world says that Devadatta knows because the complex which is Devadatta is the cause of consciousness ;
āryairapi teṣāṃ saṃjñayā tathocyante vyavahārārtham /	and, in order to conform to received usage, the Āryans also express themselves in this manner, which is inexact.
yattarhi “vijñānaṃ vijānātī“ti sūtra uktaṃ kiṃ tatra vijñānaṃ karoti / na kiñcitkaroti /	Nevertheless, a Sūtra says that the consciousness knows the object. What does the véñāna do with regard to the object? It is simply produced resembling the object.
yathā tu kāryaṃ kāraṇamanuvidhīyata ityucyate / sādṛśyenātmalābhādakurvadapi kiñcit /	In the same way that fruit, although it does nothing, is said to correspond to the seed, to reproduce the seed, because it is produced resembling the seed;
evaṃ vijñānamapi vijānātītyucyate /	the vijñāna also, although it accomplishes no action with regard to the object, is said to know the object because it is produced resembling the object.
sādṛśyenātmalābhādakurvadapi kiñcit / kiṃ punarasya sādṛśyam / tadākāratā /	This resemblance of the vijñāna consists in that it has the appearance of the object.
ata eva tadindriyādapyutpannaṃ viṣayaṃ vijānātītyucyate nendriyam /	By reason of this appearance one says that the vijñāna knows the object which is only one of its causes; the organ is also a cause of the vÉyñāna, but one does not say that the vjñāṇa knows the organ because the vijñāna does not take the aspect of the organ. This manner of speaking, “The vÉñāna knows,” is again justified from ánother point of view. Several successive moments of vôjñāna are produced with regard to the object: the previous moment is the cause of the later moment;
athavā tathā 'trāpi vijñānasaṃtānasya vijñāne kāraṇabhāvādvijñānaṃ vijānātīti vacanānnirdoṣaṃ kāraṇe dartṛśabdanirdeśāt /	the véñāna is then a cause of vijñāna; it is then called the agent since it is the.
ghaṇṭā rautīti yadvat / api khalu yathā pradīpo gacchati tathā vijñānaṃ vijānātīti / kathaṃ ca pradīpo gacchati /	One attributes the action of knowing to it as one attributes the action of ringing to a bell or the action of moving to a lamp.
pradīpa ityarciṣāṃ saṃtāna upacaryate /	One says that the lamp moves: here is what the moving of the lamp consists of: “lamp” is the name metaphorically attributed to the uninterrupted series of moments of the flame that one sees, wrongly, as a “unity.”
sa deśāntareṣūtpadyamānastaṃ deśaṃ gacchatītyucyate /	When one of these successive moments is produced in place other than that of the preceeding moment, one says that the lamp moves. But there does not exist a “mover” apart from and distinct from the moment of the fire.
evaṃ vijñānamapi cittānāṃ saṃtāna upacaryate / tadviṣayāntareṣūtpadyamānaṃ taṃ viṣayaṃ vijānātītyucyate /	In the same way, one metaphorically designates a series of minds by vśjñāna, or consciousness: when one moment of mind is produced relative to a new object, one says that the consciousness knows this object.
yathā cābhijāyate tiṣṭhati rūpamityatra bhaviturbhāvādanarthantaratvamevaṃ vijñānasyāpi syāt /	One says that the consciousness knows: the same way that one says that “physical matter” exists, is produced, lasts, without there being an “exister”, a “producer,” “anything that lasts,” distinct from what is called its existence, etc. If the later consciousness is produced from the previous consciousness and not from a soul, why is not the later consciousness always similar to the previous consciousness?
yadi vijñānādvijñānamutpadyate nātmānaḥ kasmānna nityaṃ tādṛśamevotpadyate na ca kramaniyamenāṅkurakāṇḍapatradivat /	Why do not consciousnesses succeed themselves in a determined order, as do shoots, stems, leaves, etc? Answer to the first question: Because everything that is produced through causes, i.
sthityanyathātvasya saṃskṛtlakṣaṇatvāt /	, conditioned things, presents the character of “transformation”;
eṣa hi saṃskṛtasya svabhāvo yadavaśyaṃ prabandhasyānyathātvaṃ bhavati /	this is the nature of conditioned things: in the series which they form, the latter should differ from the former.
anyathā hi nikāmadhyānasamāhitānāṃ sadṛśakāyacittotpattau prathamakṣaṇaniṃrviśeṣatvāt paścādapi na syāt svayaṃ vyutthānam /	If it were otherwise, the ascetics who had entered into meditation—in which the body and the consciousness are always produced in the same way, the successive moments of the series being identical—would not spontaneously get out of meditation. As for the second difficulty: The production of consciousness is subject to a certain order.
kramo 'pi hi cittānāṃ niyata eva / yato nūtpattavyaṃ tata eva tasyotpādāt / tulyākāramapi hi kiñcidutpādane samarthaṃ bhavati / gotraviśeṣāt /	If a certain mind should be produced after a certain mind, it will be produced after this mind.
yadyathā strīcittānantaraṃ yadi tatkāyavidūṣaṇācittamutpannaṃ bhavati tatpatiputrādicittaṃ	For example, upon the idea of "woman" there immediately arises the idea of detesting the body of a woman, but there immediately arises the idea of a wife or daughter.
vā punaśca paścātsaṃtatipariṇatyā strīcittamutpadyate tat samartha bhavati tatkāyavidūṣaṇācittotpādane tatpatiputrādicittotpādane vā /	Later, following upon the differing development of the succession of ideas, the idea of a woman reproduces itself. This second idea of a woman would have the capacity of producing the idea of detesting the body, or the idea of wife or daughter, accordingly as it has either of these ideas as gotra, that is to say, as a seed;
tadgotratvāt / anyathā na samartham /	but not when it does not have a similar gotra.
atha punaḥ paryāyeṇa strīcittādvahuvidhaṃ cittamutpannaṃ vahutara māsannataraṃ vā tadevotpadyate / tadbhāvanāyā valīyastvāt /	And again innumerable different ideas can succeed the idea of a woman, and that by reason of multiple causes. Among all these ideas, those are produced first which are the most "numerous"—having formed a series in the past—the most "alive," the "nearest"—as these ideas have most strongly.
anyatra tatkālikātkāyabāhyapratyayaviśeṣāt /	Except, of course, at the moment when other ideas are produced by a certain state of the body or by certain external objects.
saiva balīyasī bhāvanā kasmānnityaṃ na phalati /	But why does the consciousness, which has most strongly impregnated the mental series, not continue to so impregnate it without ceasing?
sthityanyathātvasya saṃskṛtalakṣaṇatvāt tasya cānyathātvasyānyabhāvanāphalotpattāvānuguṇyāt /	Because, as we have said, transformation is a characteristic of the mental series; this characteristic is eminently propitious for the production of the result of ideas, having medium or small force.
etaddhi sarvacittaprakāreṣu diṅmātram /	Here we have, in an incomplete and summary manner, explained the causes and conditions of the order of the reciprocal generation of different categories of consciousness.
nirantarakāraṇajñāne tu buddhānāṃ prabhutvam //	Complete knowledge of these causes belongs only to the Buddha.
evaṃ hyāhuḥ / sarvākārakāraṇamekasya mayūracandrakasyāpi / nāsarvajñairjñeyaṃ sarvajñabalaṃ hi tajjñānami“ti //	Thus the stanza says, 'All the types of causes which go to produce a peacock feather—no one can know them except the Omniscient Ones: this is the power of knowledge of Omniscience (to know a thing completely).
prāgevārupiṇāṃ cittabhedānām /	The causes of the variety of material things areDifficult to know;
ya eva tvayamekīyastīrthika ātmaprabhavāṃ cittotpattiṃ manyate tasyaivedaṃ sphuṭaṃ codyamāpadyate kasmānna nityaṃ tādṛśamevotpadyate na ca kramaniyamenāṅkurakāṇḍapatrādivaditi	how much more difficult is it to penetrate the variety of causes and conditions of non-material things, minds and mental states! A certain non-Buddhist believes that the consciousnesses are produced from a soul. One can successfully oppose his objections vainly formulated against us: Why isn't the latter consciousness the same as the former consciousness? Why aren't the consciousnesses produced in a fixed order?
manaḥsaṃyogaviśeṣāpekṣatvāditi cet / na /	This master explains the variety of consciousnesses and the absence of a fixed rule to their arising by the diversity that he terms “the conjunction of the soul with the anas or mental organ. ” This explanation does not hold. No type of conjunction is proved.
anyasaṃyogāsiddheḥ /	On the other hand, reasoning shows that two things in conjunction should be delimited, that is to say, localized in distinct places.
saṃyoginostu paricchinnatvādaprāptipūrvikā prāptiḥ samyoga iti lakṣaṇavyākhyānāccātmānaḥ paricchedaprasaṅgaḥ /	Judge if your definition of conjunction, “possession succeeding upon non-possession, admits of the same conclusion as our reasoning, namely that the soul is delimited, localized.
tato manaḥsamcārādātmanaḥ saṃcāraprasaṅgo virāgasya vā /	It also results from your definition of conjunction that, when the manas moves—it goes to such and such a part of the body—the soul should also move to make a place for it or that it should perish or eternal.
pradeśasaṃyoga iti cet / na /	On the other hand, you cannot admit that the soul is in partial conjunction with the manas, for, according to you, the soul is an entity without parts.
tasyaiva tatpradeśatvāyogāt / astu vā saṃyogastathāpi nityamaviśiṣṭe manasi kathaṃ saṃyogaviśeṣaḥ /	Supposing also that there is conjunction between the permanent soul and an always immoveable manas, how does one explain the diversity of the conjunction necessary for the diversity of consciousness?
buddhiviśeṣāpekṣa iti cet /	Would you say that this diversity results from the diversity of the buddhi, intelligence, which is a quality, guna, of the soul?
sa eva paricodyate kathaṃ buddhiviśeṣa iti / saṃskāraviśeṣāpekṣādātmamanaḥ saṃyogāditi cet /	But the buddhi presents the same difficulty as the manas if the soul is not diversified, how would buddhi be diversified?
cittādevāstu saṃskāraviśeṣāpekṣatvāt /	Would you say that the diversity of the buddhi results. From the diversity of conjunction of the soul and the meanas, a variety which results from the sa/skāras? In this hypothesis, the soul serves no purpose; why not say that the diversity of consciousnesses comes from the consciousness itself which is diversified by the saṁskéāras?
nahi kiñcidātmanaḥ upalabhyate sāmarthmauṣadha kāryasiddhāviva kuhakavaidyaphuḥsvāhānām /	The soul does not intervene in the beginning of consciousness, and to say that consciousness comes from a soul is to be as the charlatan who, although drugs suffice for the healing of the sickness, pronounces some magic syllables: Phuṭ! You would say without doubt that consciousness, like the saṁskāras, exists through conjunction with the soul: but this is merely a statement without proof.
satyātmani tayoḥ saṃyoga iti cet / vāṅmātram / āśrayaḥ sa iti cet / yathā kaḥ kasyāśrayaḥ /	But you would insist, saying that the soul is its support : please explain by an example the nature of the relationship of the support and the supported. The consciousness and the saṁskāras themselves are not a picture or a fruit that the soul supports as a wall supports a picture or as a plate supports fruit: in fact, on thePhysical contact exists between the soul and thought-rzeṁskāras.
na hi te citravadarādivadādhārye nāpi sa kuḍacyakuṇḍādivadādhāro yuktaḥ / pratighātiyutadoṣāt naiva sa evamāśrayaḥ / kathaṃ tarhi /	The picture and fruit exist independently of the wall and plate.
yathā gandhādīnāṃ pṛthivīti cet / atiparitoṣitāḥ smaḥ /	The soul supports thought-raṁskāras like earth supports smell, color, taste, and touch.
idameva hi naḥ pratyāyakaṃ nāstyātmeti /	This comparison establishes the non-existence of the soul. The thought-saṁskāras are what one designates by the word "soul".
yathā na gandhādibhyo 'nyā pṛthivīti /	The idea of "earth" cannot be obtained apart from smell, etc. Certain smells, etc. , are qualified as properties of earth to distinguish them.
ko hi sa gandhādibhyo 'nyāṃ pṛthivīṃ nirdhārayati / vyapadeśastu pṛthivyā gandhādaya iti viśeṣaṇārtham / te hyeva tadākhyā gandhādayo yathā pratīyerannānya iti /	other words, one wants to indicate that certain smells, tastes, etc. , are what is termed “earth,” not other smells or tastes which are termed “water.
kāṣṭhapratimāyāṃ śarīravyapadeśavat /	” In the same way, one designates a certain thing as being “the body of a wooden statue” indicating by that that it is of wood, and not of baked clay.
satyapi ca saṃskāraviśeṣāpekṣatve kasmānna yugapatsarvajñānotpattiḥ /	If the soul produces the consciousnesses by reason of the variety of the saṁskāras, why doesn’t it produce all the consciousnesses at the same time?
yo hi baliṣṭhastenānyeṣāṃ prativandhaḥ / sa eva valiṣṭhaḥ kasmānnityaṃ na phalati / yo 'sya nyāyaḥ so 'stu bhāvanāyāḥ /	Because the strongest rarṅskāra opposes the weakest seṁskāra in producing its result. And if the strongest saṁskāra does not constantly produce its result, it is for the same reason that you have given in explaining the traces abandoned by the consciousness in the series: we think that the saṁskāras are not permanent and are subject to change.
ātmā tu nirarthakaḥ kalpyate /	But then of what use is a soul? Diverse consciousnesses would be generated by the diverse force of the saeṁskāras, since there is no difference in nature between your sarskāras and our vāsanās. Memory, the saṁskāras, etc. , are things that are termed “attributes”;
avaśyamātmābhyupagantavyaḥ / smṛtyādīnāṃ guṇapadārthatvāt tasya cārthādavaśyaṃ dravyāśritatvāt teṣāṃ cānyāśrayāyogāditi cet /  na /	these attributes must of necessity have for their substratum, or support, a “substance” and, among the nine substances, the soul, since it is inadmissable that memory and the other mental qualities would have for their substratum any substance other than the soul, since the soul alone is intelligent.
na hyeṣāṃ guṇapadārthatvaṃ siddham /	But this system of substances and attributes is not proved.
sarvameva no vidyamānaṃ dravya /	We think that all that exists is “substance.”
“ṣaṭ dravyāṇi śrāmaṇyaphalānī“ti vacanāt /	A Sūtra says that “the result of the religious life consists of six substances.”
nāpyeṣāṃ dravyāśritatvaṃ siddham / parīkṣito hyāśrayārthaḥ /	It is false that memory, etc. , has the soul as its substratum: as we have criticized the idea of a substratum.
tasmādyatkiñcideva tat / ātmanyasati kimarthaḥ karmārambhaḥ /	If the soul does not really exist, what is the result of actions?
ahaṃ sukhī syāmahaṃ duḥkhī na syāmityevamarthaḥ /	The result of actions is that the “soul’ experiences pleasure or pain.
ko 'sāvahaṃ nāma yadviṣayio 'yamahaṅkāraḥ /	What do you understand by “soul’’?
skandhaviṣayaḥ /	It is what one speaks of when one says “I,” the object of the idea of self, the skandhas or object.
kathaṃ jñāyate / teṣu snehāt / gaurādibuddhibhiḥ sāmānādhikaraṇyāttu /	How do we know this? It is to the series of skandhas, that is, to the skanṉdhas—to oṉe’s body, to one’s sensations—-that one becomes attached;
gauro 'hamahaṃ śyāmaḥ sthūlo 'hamahaṃ kṛśaḥ jīrṇo 'hamahaṃ yuveti gaurādibuddhibhiḥ sāmānādhikaraṇo 'yamahaṅkāro dṛśyate / na cātmana ete prakārā dṛśyante /	as the idea of “I” is generated with reference to the idea of white and other similar ideas: in the world does one not say “I am white, black, old, young, thin, fat”? What one regards as white, etc,.
tasmādapi skandheṣvayamiti gamyate /	—evidently the skandha of physical mattero—is also what one regards as “L.” The “ṣoul” imagined by the Vaiśeṣika is different from white, etc. ; but, in fact, the idea of “I¹ is relative only to those skandhas and not to any “self” imagined. It is through metaphor that the world designates the body by the word “I” when it says, “I am white.”
ātmana upakārake 'pi śarīra ātmopacāro yathā ya evāyaṃ sa evāhaṃ sa evāyaṃ me bṛtya iti bhavatyupakārake 'pi ātmopacāro natvahaṅkāraḥ /	This metaphor is justified because the body is in the service of the true “L.” So be iti: one metaphorṟically calls what is used by the “I” by the name of “I.”
sati śarīrālambanatve paraśarīrālamvano 'pi kasmānna bhavati / asaṃvandhāt /	But one cannot explain in this manner the consciousness that says “I”Because there is no relationship between the series of skandhas of others and this idea.
yenaiva hi sahāsya saṃvandhaḥ kāyena cittena vā yatraivāyamahaṅkāra utpadyate nānvatra /	When the body or mind is in a relationship with the idea of “I"’—a cause and effect relationship—this idea is generated with regard to this body and this mind; but not with regard to the skandhas of others.
anādau saṃsārra evamabhyāsāt / kaśca saṃbandhaḥ / kāryakāraṇabhāvaḥ /	The habit of considering “my” series as “I” exists in “my” series from the very beginning.
yadyātmā nāsti kasyāyamahaṅkāraḥ /	If there is no “soul,” to what do you attribute the idea of “I'?
idaṃ punastadeāyātaṃ “kimarthaiṣā ṣaṣṭhīti /	We have answered this question when we explained what memory belongs to.
yāvadya evāsya hetustasyaivāyami“ti /	The master of memory is simply the cause of memory. It is the same for the idea of “I".
kaścānyo hetuḥ /	What is the cause of the idea of “I’?
pūrvāhaṅkāraparibhāvitaṃ svasaṃtativiṣayaṃ sāvadyaṃ cittam /	It is a defiled mind, impregnated by this same idea of self, and having for its object the series of minds wherein it is produced.
asatyātmani ka eṣa sukhito duḥkhito vā /	In the absence of a soul, who has suffering or pleasure?
yasminnāśraye sukhamutpannaṃ duḥkhaṃ vā /	The āśraya within which suffering or pleasure is.
yathā puṣpito vṛkṣaḥ phalitaṃ vanamiti / kaḥ punaranayorāśrayaḥ /	Produced, in the same way that a tree is said to have flowers, a forest has fruit.
ṣaḍāyatanam / yathā kṛtvā tathoktam /	And the āfraya in question may belong to any of the six internal āyatanas, the eye-āyataṉa, etc. This has been explained.
asatyātmani ka eṣāṃ karmaṇāṃ kartā kaśca phalānāṃ bhoktā bhavati /	In the absence of a soul, who is it that does a deed? Who is it that tastes the result?
karteti ka eṣa vāhyarthaḥ /	What do you understand by ‘“he who does,” and `he who tastes¹’?
karotīti kartā /	We understand this to be the agent, the taster. Your explanation is merely words and explains nothing. The Vaiśeṣikas here invoke the doctrine of the Grammarians.
bhuṅkta iti bhoktā / paryāya ucyate nārthaḥ / “svatantraḥ karte“ti kartṛ lakṣaṇamācakṣate lākṣaṇikāḥ /	They say that the agent is he who has independent power, that the taster is he who enjoys the result of the deed.
asti punaḥ kvacideva kārye kasyacit svātantryam /	Iṅ the world he who possesses independent power with regard to a certain action is considered as the '“agent”ʼ;
loke dṛṣṭaṃ devadattasya snānāsanagamanādau /	for example, Devadatta, having the power to bathe himself, to seat himself, and to walk, is called “the bather,” “the sitter,” and “the walker.” This definition is not admissable.
kaḥ punarbhavān devadattamudāharati /	What does one understand by “Devadatta”?
yadyātmānaṃ sa eva sādhyaḥ /	If one understands this to be a soul, the example is.
atha pañcaskandhakaṃ sa ev kartā /	If one understands a certain coming together or complex of séandhas, then Devadatta is indeed an agent, but he is not ‘an independent agent and creator of deeds.”
trividhaṃ cedaṃ karma kāyavāṅmanaskarma /	Action is threefold ~body, speech, and mind.
tatra kāyakarmaṇi tāvat kāyasya cittaparatantrā vṛttiḥ /	That which produces bodily action is the wind agitating the body;
cittasyāpi kāye svakāraṇaparatantrā vṛttistasyāpyevamiti nāsti kasyacit svātantryam /	the body and the mind depend again on their causes and conditions; these causes and conditions depend in their turn on their causes and conditions: in all this there is not any simple entity, a “producer” dependent on itself or, in other words, independent.
pratyayaparatantrā hi sarve bhāvāḥ pravartante /	For everything that exists depends on causes and conditions.
ātmano 'pi ca nirapekṣasyākāraṇatvābhyupagamātra svātantryaṃ sidhyati /	The soul as you understand it does not depend on causes and conditions; furthermore, it does nothing;
tasmānnaivaṃlakṣaṇam upalabhyate kaścitkartā /	it is not then an independent agent. Nowhere does anyone maintain the existence of an agent conforming to your definition, “He who possesses independent power is termed an agent.”
yattu yasya pradhānaṃ kāraṇaṃ tattsya kartetyucyate /	That which one terms the agent of a certain action, is, amongst all its causes, that which is the principal. Memory causes a wish or a desire for action to surge up; from desire there proceeds imagination; from imagination there proceeds effort which gives rise to a vapor which sets in motion bodily action. In this process, what activity do the Vaiśeṣikas attrṛibute to a 'soul"?
na ca ātmanaḥ kvacidapi kāraṇatvaṃ dṛśyate /	This soul is certainly not an agent of bodily action.
tasmātsa evamapi na kartā yujyate / smṛtijo hi cchandaḥ cchandajo vitarko vitarkātprayatnaḥ prayatnādvāyustataḥ karmeti kimatrātmā kurute /	Vocal and mental action can be explained in the same way.
phalasyāpica ka upabhogo yamayamātmā kurvannupabhoktā kalpyate / upalabhiriti cet /	You say that the "soul" enjoys the result, because it discerns or knows the result: but soul has no role in discerning the result;
nātmanaḥ upalabdhau sāmarthyaṃ vijñāne pratipedhāt /	it does not figure among the causes that produce consciousnesses as we have shown above.
asatyātmani kasmādasattvādhiṣṭhānaḥ pāpapuṇyopacayo na bhavati /	If there is no soul, why do good and bad deeds not die out in "non-living things"?
vedanādyanāśrayatvāt tadāśrayaśca ṣaḍāyatanaṃ nātmā yathā tathoktam /	Because the "non-assumed" elements, not constitutive of living beings, are not susceptible of serving as a support for sensation.
kathamasatyātmani venaṣṭātkarmaṇa āyatyāṃ phalotpattiḥ /	In the absence of a soul, how can past action, which is now destroyed, produce a future result?
ātmanyapi sati kathaṃ vinaṣṭāt karmaṇa āyatyāṃ phalotpattiḥ / tadāśritāddharmādharmāt /	To this question we would answer now by asking how, even though a soul were to exist, destroyed action can have the force of producing the result.
yathā kaḥkimāśrita ityuktottaraiṣā vāco yuktiḥ / tasmādanāśritādeva dharmādharmāt bhavatu /	The Vaiśeṣikas would have it that the result is generated from merit or from demerit, inherent attributes of the soul, supported by the soul: but we have criticized the idea of a substratum or “support” and shown that it is not rational.
naiva tu vayaṃ vinaṣṭāt karmaṇa āyatyāṃ phalotpattiṃ brūmaḥ / kiṃ tarhi /	According to the Buddhists, future results are not generated from destroyed action;
tatsaṃtatipariṇāmaviśeṣādvījaphalavat /	results are generated from the last moment in the evolution of a series that has its origin in action. How does fruit proceed from the seed?
yathā vījātphalamutpadyata ityucyate /	One says, in the world, that fruit is generated from a seed.
na ca tadvinaṣṭādvījādutpadyate / nāpyanantarameva / kiṃ tarhi /	But in speaking in this way, one does not intend to affirm that the fruit is generated from a destroyed seed, nor that the fruit arises immediately after the seed. In fact, the fruit is generated from the last moment in the evolution of a series that has its origin in the seed.
tatsaṃtatipariṇāmaviśeṣādaṅkurakāṇḍapatrādikramaniṣpannāt puṣpāvasānāt /	The seed successively produces a sprout, a stalk, a leaf, and finally the flower that brings the fruit into existence.
tat punaḥ puṣpānniṣpannaṃ kasmāttasya vījasya phalamityucyate /	If one says that the seed produces the fruit, this is because the seed, through a series of intermediate stages, projects in the flower the efficacy of producing the fruit.
tadāhitaṃ hi tat parayāpuṣpe sāmarthyam / yadi hi tatpūrvikānnabhaviṣyat tattādṛśasya phalasyotopattau na samarthamabhaviṣyat /	If the efficacy of producing the fruit, efficacy which is found in the flower, did not have the seed as its original cause, then the flower would not have produced a fruit resembling its seed.
evaṃ karmaṇaḥ phalamutpadyata ityucyate / na ca tadviniṣṭātkarmaṇa utpadyate nāpyanantarameva / kiṃ tarhi /	In the same way, one says that although a result is generated from an action, it is not generated from destroyed action, nor is it generated immediately after the action: it is generated from an ultimate moment in the evolution of a series issuing from the action. Series, or santana, means the material and mental rkandhas succeeding without interruption in a row which has an action for its original cause.
tatsaṃtatipariṇāmaviśeṣāt /	The successive moments of this row are.
kā punaḥ saṃtatiḥ kaḥ pariṇāmaḥ ko viśeṣaḥ /	There is then evolution, or transformation of the series.
yaḥ karmapūrva uttarottaracittapravasaḥ sā saṃtatistasyā anyathotpattiḥ pariṇāmaḥ / sa punartho 'ntaraṃ phalotpādanasamarthaḥ so 'ntapariṇāmaviśiṣṭatvāt pariṇamaviśeṣaḥ /	The last moment of this evolution possesses a special efficacy, the capacity of immediately producing the result: it is distinguished, in this regard, from other moments; it is then termed vinesa, or the ultimate moment of evolution.
tadyāthā sopādānaṃ maraṇacittaṃ punarbhavasya /	For example, when the mind at death is "associated with attachment," it possesses the capacity of producing a new existence.
trividhakarmapūrvakatve 'pi yatkarma guru vā bhavatyāsannamabhyastaṃ vā yatkṛtaṃ sāmarthyaṃ dyotyate natvanyasya / āha ca “yat guru yaccāsannaṃ yaccābhyastaṃ kṛtaṃ ca yat /	This mind has for its antecedents many actions of all types: nevertheless, it is the efficacy projected by a weighty action that informs the last thought; in the absence of heavy action, the efficacy is projected by near action; in its absence by habitual action;
pūrvaṃ pūrvaṃ pūrvaṃ vīpacyate karmasaṃsāre” //	and in its absence by the action of a previous life. There is a stanza which says, "Weighty action, near action, habitual action, old action: these four die in this order.
tatra vipākahetvāhitaṃ tu vipākaphaladānasāmarthyaṃ vipākaṃ dattvā vinivartate /	There is good reason to establish a distinction between a retributive result and an out-flowing result. When the force that produces a retributive result has given forth its result, this force is. But the force that produces an out-flowing result, a force projected by a ““cause similar to its effect” , does not perish by the production of its result;
sabhāgahetvāhitaṃ tu niṣyandaphaladānasāmarthyaṃ kliṣṭānāṃ pratipakṣodayādvinivartate /	when it is defiled, this force perishes by the force of its opposition;
akliṣṭānāṃ cittasaṃtānātyantavinivṛtteryadā parinirvāti /	when it is not defiled, it perishes through Nirvāṇa, which involves the abolition of the series, both physical matter and mind.
atha kasmādvipākādvipākāntaraṃ notpadyate vījaphalādiva phalāntaram / na tāvat dṛṣṭāntena sarvaṃ samānaṃ bhavati /	Why is a new retribution not generated from the retributive result as a new fruit is generated from the fruit of a tree, or as a fruit is also a seed? But a new fruit is not generated from the fruit seed.
tatrāpi tu na phalādeva punaḥ phalāntaramutpadyate / kiṃ tarhi / viklittiviśeṣajādvikāraviśeṣāt /	From what is the new fruit generated, if not from the evolution of a new series? The first fruit seed, encountering the conditions necessary for evolution , finally produces the ultimate moment in the evolution—from whence the new fruit arises.
yo hi tatra bhūtaprakārāṅkuraṃ nirvartayati sa tasya vījaṃ nānyaḥ /	When it produces the shoot, the old fruit takes the name of seed.
bhāvinyā tu saṃjñāyā sādṛśyādvā pūrvako 'pi saṃtāno bījamityākhyāyate /	If, before any evolution, , it is given the name of seed, it is an anticipative name, a name justified by the similarity of the ungerminated seed and the germinated.
evamihāpi tasmādvipākādyadi sadasaddharmaśravaṇā dipratyayaviśeṣajaḥ kuśalasāsravo 'kuśalo vā cittavikāra utpadyate tasmātpunarvikārāntaramutpadyate nānyatheti samānametat /	In the same way here when a retributive result encounters the conditions that produce good and bad—good teaching, bad teaching—it gives rise to minds that will be rewarded, namely bad or good-impure minds. From these minds there proceeds an evolution of their series that results in an ultimate state from whence a new retribution will emerge. This is not generated under any other conditions. The example then justifies our thesis.
athavā punaretadevaṃ vijñātavyam /	One can also take into account the nature of the retribution by another example that shows that a new retribution does not necessarily succeed the first.
yathā lākṣārasarañjitāt mātuluṅgapuṣpātsaṃtatipariṇāmaviśeṣajaḥ phale raktaḥ keśara upajāyate na ca tasmāt punaranyaḥ evaṃ karmajādvipākāt na punarvipākāntaramiti / yathāsthūlamidamasmadbuddhigamyaṃ darśitam /	If one colors the flower of a lemon tree with milk, a certain evolution of the plant series will take place which will cause the seed of the new fruit to be red. But the red seed, once planted, will not generate another red seed. In the same way the retribution of an action does not produce a new retribution.
nānāvidhaśaktibhinnaistu karmabhiradhivāsitāḥ saṃtataya etāmavasthāṃ gatā īdṛśaṃ phalamabhinivartayantīti buddhānāmeva viṣayaḥ / āha khalvapi “karma tadbhāvanāṃ tasyā vṛttilābhaṃ tataḥ phalam /	I have, to the measure of my intelligence, taught in a summary and outline manner the result of actions.
niyamena prajānāti buddhādanyio na sarvathā // ityetāṃ suvihitahetumārgaśuddhāṃ buddhānāṃ pravacanadharmatāṃ niśamya /	Only the Buddhas know. There is a stanza, 'Action, the impression caused by the action, the active entry of this impression, the result that results from it—no one if not a Buddha, knows all this in the totality of its processes.
andhānāṃ vividhakudṛṣṭiceṣṭitānāṃ tīrthyānāṃ matamapavidhya yāntyanandhāḥ //	' Seeing then, by a path of demonstrative arguments, that the doctrine of the teaching of the Buddhas is perfect, and rejecting the opinion of those blind through bad views and through bad steps, the non-blind see.
imaṃ hi nirvāṇapuraikavartinīṃ	In fact, this doctrine of the non-existence of the soul is the only road to the city of Nirvāṇa;
