yato vijñānād bahī rūpādayo na gṛhyante / svapnāadivad vijñānaṃ rūpādyābhāsam utapdyate /	For thus, form and the like are not apprehended externally to consciousness consciousness arises in the appearance of form etc., like in dreams etc.,
na ca yad yasya kāraṇaṃ tad abhāve tasyotpattir yujyate /	and if it has a cause, its arising in the absence of one is not tenable.

nāsyetad yasmāt tasyām api sa vidyate /	In order to demonstrate that the side of purification is to be sought from the side of defilement and the individual continuum does not exist separately, he says here.The question arises if the duality does not exist, how can Alternatively, in order to refute all negation, he says there is the imagination of what is unreal considering that it is not entirely nonexistent, nor does it have the nature of an existent since it exists in the nature of the transformation of consciousness. However, there are those who believe that form etc. exists, by way of ownbeing, in exactly that way in which they manifest, i. e. as separate from unreal imagination. With regard to such and in order to refute imputation in regard to what is unreal, he says the duality is not found therein. The intended meaning is that there is just bare unreal imagination. The nonexistence of the duality is apprehended by some as of the nature of annihilation, like the absolute nonexistence of the son of an infertile woman. The absence of an internally active being is said to be fequivalent to the emptiness of the dharmas by others. Hence, in order to refute the negation of emptiness, and in order to reveal insubstantiality in reality, he says but here emptiness is found.If emptiness exists in the imagination of what is unreal, then all living beings would be liberated effortlessly.

Hence, because it is without aspect means because there is no apprehender. Alternatively, the aspect consists in the correct knowledge of the objective support and since this is nonexistent on the part of the latter objects and sentient beings, they are without aspect because of the nonexistence of the objective support. If both objects and sentient beings are without aspect and have natures that are mutually differentiated, i. e. just as there is form etc. on the one hand and sight etc. on the other this being so, what is this exceptional essence belonging to consciousness rather than form etc. and sight etc. which are well known both generally and exegetically, whence, after rejecting them, consciousness is perceived to have a nature that is not differentiated from them? Because it is impossible that the object exists separately from that consciousness.This is respectively determined as follows consciousness in the appearances of different objects etc.

ataścārthasattvavijñānasyevātmavijñaptipratibhāsasyāpyarthābhāvaḥ /	Hence the object of the appearances as the self and representations also does not exist, just like the objects of the appearances as objects and sentient beings.
arthābhāvāt tad vijñānam asat / vijānātīti vijñānaṃ grāhyābhāve vijānanāpy ayuktaṃ /	Because of the nonexistence of the object, the former too does not exist, i.e. consciousness it is described as consciousness vijñāna since it discerns vijānāti.If the apprehended object does not exist, the existence of the discerning agent is not tenable.

tad bhinnasvabhāve sati tad vijñānaṃ kathaṃ yujyeta kathaṃ parasparaṃ bhinnaṃ bhavet ? ////	If its essential nature were different from this how would the existence of that consciousness be tenable? How could one be differentiated from the other?
evaṃgrāhyagrāhakābhāvāt tat pratibhāsavijñānasadbhāvāc ca yat pūrvaṃ pratijñātaṃ abhūtaparikalpo'sti dvayaṃ tatra na vidyate /	Thus, because of the nonexistence of the apprehended object and the apprehending subject and due to the actual existence of consciousness in the appearance of the latter, that which was asserted previously, i. e. there is the imagination what is unreal the duality is not found therein, has been established.
iti tat prasiddham iti pradarśayann āha abhūtaparikalpatvaṃ siddham asya bhavatyataḥ / abhūtaparikalpatvañca teṣāñcaturṇāṃ vijñānānāṃ siddhaṃ /	In order to demonstrate this, he says Consequently it has been proven that the imagination of what is unreal pertains to this consciousness That the imagination of what is unreal pertains to these four consciousnesses has been proven.By consequently, is meant by reason of what was just stated, i.e. Alternatively, by consequently is meant by the reason that will be stated below.
tameva pradarṣayannāh na tathā sarvathā'bhāvāt iti/	In order to demonstrate just this, he says because it does not exist as such, nor is it nonexistent in every respect.

etad uktaṃ bhavati bhrāntivijñānasya sadbhāvān na sarvathā'bhāva iti /	This is what is being said because of the actual existence of consciousness that consists in error, consciousness is not nonexistent in every respect.

If such a question implies that its existence is unable to be imagined by anyone since it transcends the domain of all consciousnesses, the answer is because.
yasmāt tat kṣayān muktir iṣyate /	I. Liberation is considered as being due to its extinction.
ato'syābhāva eva neṣyate / kiṃ tarhi sankleśavyavadānapakṣasāmarthāt tad astitvam anumīyate /	Hence its definite nonexistence is not accepted on the contrary, its existence is inferred because of its capacity as a basis] for the sides of defilement and purification.
anyatheti yadi tasya sarvathābhāva eveṣyate na bandho na mokṣa iti /	Otherwise, if its definite nonexistence in every respect is accepted, there would be neither bondage nor liberation.

tasmiṃścāparikṣīṇe bandha ityarthād uktaṃ bhavati /	He says liberation considered as being due to its extinction what is meant is when that is not completely extinguished there is bondage.
anyathā hi na bandho na mokṣa iti sankleśavyavadānāpavādadoṣaḥ syāt /	This is what is being said otherwise there would be the fault of the negation of defilement and purification since neither bondage nor liberation could be established.
yathā grāhyagrāhakatvena bhrāntir udbhāsitā'pi yadi tathā syāt paramārthata evaṃ sati nityaḥ sankleśaḥ syāt / tathā ca nirvāṇābhāvaḥ /	If phenomena were to exist absolutely in exactly that way in which they appear as the apprehended object and apprehending subject for all beings from cattle upwards, this being the case, defilement would be eternal and thus there would be no nirvana.
evaṃ ca bhrāntimātrasyāpy abhāve sankleśābhāvo nityañca vyavadānaṃ prasajyeta /	Similarly, if bare error were also nonexistent, there would be no defilement, and purification would be eternal.

atha vā yena sangraho lakṣyate tat sangrahalakṣaṇaṃ / tac ca kim artham uktaṃ ? atra hi grāhyagrāhakarahitam abhūtaparikalpamātramevāstīty ayuktaṃ /	The term samgrahalakṣaṇam may be resolved as a karmadhāraya compound, i.e. the totality itself is the characteristic, or as a tatpuruşa] the characteristic of the totality, i.e. that by which the totality is characterized.And why is it mentioned?
sūtrāntareṣu punas trayaḥ svabhāvāḥ paṭhyante / ataḥ sūtrāntarair avirodhapradarśanārthaṃ teṣām iha sangraha ucyate /	Furthermore, the three natures are taught in other Sutras, hence, in order to demonstrate that there is no contradiction with other Sutras, their totality is described here. This is why the author of the commentary says . . .

parair hetupratyayais tantryate janyate na tu svayambhavatīti paratantraḥ /	The imagination of what is unreal consists in the otherdependent nature it is otherdependent since it depends on, or is produced by, other causes and conditions but does not exist in itself.

atra hy abhūtaparikalpasya dvayarahitatā grāhyagrāhakābhāva uktaḥ / na tu dvayasyābhāvamātraṃ /	For, in this context, the absence of the duality on the part of the imagination of the unreal is described as the nonexistence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, but not merely the nonexistence of the duality.
evañcābhūtaparikalpa eva hetupratyapāratantryāt paratantraḥ / sa eva grāhyagrāhakarūpeṇa svātmany avidyamānena prakhyānāt parikalpitaḥ /	Thus, it is just the imagination of the unreal that is otherdependent because it depends upon causes and conditions.The latter also is imaginary because it manifests in the natures of the apprehended object and apprehending subject which are nonexistent in themselves.
sa eva grāhyagrāhakarahitatvāt pariniṣpannaḥ /	The latter is also perfected because of its absence of the apprehended object and apprehending.
etenā'bhūtaparikalpam anūdya parijñeyaṃ parijñāya prahātavyaṃ parijñāya sākṣāt kartavyañca vastu sandarśitaṃ bhavati ////	After considering it in this way, having clearly comprehended what is to be clearly comprehended and having clearly comprehended what is to be relinquished, that entity of the imagination of the unreal that is to be realized, has been shown.
aparijñātāsal lakṣaṇo hy abhūtaparikalpaḥ kleśakarmajanmasankleśāya sampravartate /	Based upon nonperception, nonperception comes into being. Based upon the perception of representationonly, the nonperception of the object originates.

sa punar dharmadhātoḥ sarvatragārthapratibodhaprayoganiśraya viśeṣaḥ kuśalo dvividhaḥ /	Moreover, this consists in a twofold skill, i.e. a special basis for the application to penetrate the allpervading sense of the dharmadhātu.

evaṃ hy anena vicārayitavyaṃ utpadyamānam anutpannaṃ vā vijñānaṃ viṣayamālambeta /	It should be deliberated upon in this way consciousness, whether in the process of arising, or, already arisen, would depend upon a senseobject.

yadi vālambanasya vartamāna eva vijñāne vyāpāro notpadyamāne evam ālambanapratyayo na vijṇyānotpādakaḥ /	Alternatively, if the functioning of the objective support occurs when consciousness is already present and not when it is in the process of arising, then consciousness does not arise with the objective support for its causal condition.

na cā'rthākārasyā'nyanirbhāsasya vijñānasyānyad ālambanaṃ / cakṣurādīnām apy ālambanatvaprasanga iti /	Moreover, consciousness appearing as one thing in the aspect of the object cannot have an objective support which is different, since even sight and the other would be objective supports.
yo'pi manyate samuditāḥ paramāṇava ālambanaṃ na pratyekaṃ tasyāpy ayam aparihāraḥ / samuditā api hi te pratyekam evālambanatveneṣYante na tat samudāyena /	Moreover, one may believe that an accumulation of atoms forms the objective support but the individual do not this is also a nonargument, for although they may be accumulated they can only be considered as objective supports individually not as an accumulation.

vijñānakāraṇaṃ hi samanantarādipratyayavad ālambanapratyayo'pīṣyate /	The objective supportcausal condition is also considered to be the cause of consciousness.
tasmān na nirudhyamāno'pyālambanaṃ /	Therefore, it is not possible that something that ceases to exist can be the objective supportcausal condition.
atha ca niruddha ālambanaṃ evaṃ satyātītānāgataṃ viṣayaḥ syāt / svapnādau tu vijñānam anālambanam iti siddhaṃ /	Likewise, if that which has actually ceased to exist forms the objective support, this Some believe that the consciousness in dreams etc.

na hi svapnādāvasatyarthe tannimittaṃ yujyate mukhādyabhāve tat pratibimbavat /	But, the sign is the reflected image of the object which has the dissociated formative forces for its own being, for if the object does not exist in dreams etc.
utpadyamānam utpannaṃ vālambanaṃ vijñānanimittam abhāvān nirodhāc ceti pūrvam uktaṃ /	, its reflection cannot be established.Consciousness, whether in the process of arising or already arisen, does not have the sign for its objective support because both its nonexistence and cessation have already been described.
vijñānameva arthapratibhāsatvād arthapratibimbaṃ / ato na viprayuktasaṃskārātmakaṃ nimittaṃ yujyate /	Consciousness itself consists in the reflection of the object because of the fact that it is an appearance of the object, hence it is not tenable that the sign has the nature of the dissociated formative forces.
avaśyaṃ cārthākāraṃ vijñānam abhyupagantavyaṃ / anākāre hi tasmin grāhyagrāhakaniyama eva na syāt /	Moreover, consciousness is to be admitted necessarily as possessing the aspect of the object, for if it were without aspect, one could not determine the apprehended object and apprehending subject.
anyastvapratighaṃ rūpameva svapne yogināṃ cāśubhādāvālambanaṃ manyate /	However, others believe that nonresistant matter forms the objective support in a dream and in the meditative contemplation of ascetics upon impure things etc.
tasyāpi varṇasaṃsthānādyātmakatvād apratighatvaṃ manomātraviṣayatvañca virudhyate /	But the notion that the latter are nonresistant and belong to the domain of mind alone is contradicted by the fact that they have colour and shape etc.

na jātyandhaḥ svapne rūpaṃ na gṛhṇāti / avyutpannasanketatvāt tu nāmato na jānāty ato nānyasyācaṣṭe /	It is not that one who is blind from birth does not perceive colour in dreams, rather, because the objects conventional symbol has not been explained to him, he does not know it by name and hence cannot communicate it to others.
yadi cānubhūtasyaiva svapne darśanam evaṃ jātyandhasyāpi rūpadarśanaṃ kiṃ neṣyate ? tenāpi pūrvajanmasu rūpam upalabdham eva /	Moreover, if it is only what has been experienced in the past that one sees in a dream, then why is it not considered that one who is blind from birth also does not see colour, for colour certainly was perceived by such a person in previous lives?
na ca vartamānajanmany upalabdham eva svapne pratibhāsate / na hy atītānāgatavartamānānubhave suptasya jāgrataś ca kaścid viśeṣo'sti /	Also, it is not that only what is perceived in the present life appears in a dream, for there is no distinction whatever between one who sleeps and one who is awake in relation to past, future and present experience.
tasmāt parikalpamātram evaitad anubhūtārthaviṣayaṃ svapne vijñānam iti / atītasya cābhāvān nirviṣayaṃ vijñānam eva svapne'rthābhāsam utpadyata iti niścayaḥ /	Therefore, it is purely hypothetical to assert that consciousness has an object of past experience as its.Moreover, because the past experience is nonexistent it is certain that consciousness, although devoid of a senseobject, arises in the appearance of the object in a dream.
evaṃ vijñaptimātratvenopalambhād arthā'nupalabdhir bhāvyeti / ya arthā'nupalabdhiṃ niścitya vijṇaptimātrasyāpyanupalabdhirjāyata iti/ yatha na vijṇyanād bahiḥ parikalpitaṃ grāhyamastīti vijñaptimātratābalena manogrāhyābhāvaṃ praviśati tathā grāhyabhāvabalena vijñaptimātrasyāpy abhāvaṃ pratipadyate /	Thus, the notion of the nonperception of the senseobject is cultivated because its perception occurs as a mental representationonly. Based upon the nonperception of the object, the nonperception of representationonly originates as well. Just as one enters the nonexistence of the apprehended object through the force of representationonly, since the imaginary apprehended object does not exist externally to consciousness similarly, one understands the nonexistence of representationonly too through the force of the nonexistence of the apprehended object.
na grāhyābhāve grāhakatvaṃ yujyate / grāhyam apekṣya tad grāhakasya vyavasthāpanāt /	It is not tenable that the apprehending subject exists if the apprehended object does not exist because the determination of the subjectivity of that is dependent upon objectivity.

Because the apprehending subject is dependent upon the apprehended object when the object to be supported does not exist one easily enters due to the destruction of the entity which has the nature of the objective support.
anyathā bhāvāpavādam eva kuryāt / grāhyagrāhakayoḥ parasparanirapekṣatvāt /	Otherwise there would be a definite negation of existence because the apprehended object and apprehending subject would be devoid of the relation of mutual dependence.

iti /	Consequently, i. e.
tata iti upalabhyārthābhāve upālabdhyabhāvāt /	because there can be no perception if there is no object to be perceived.
upalabdhir iti bhāvakartṛkaraṇānām anyatamat parikalpyate / etat tritayam apy abhāvān na yujyate /	The term perception could be construed as any one of a state, an agent, or an instrument however this trio is not tenable due to the nonexistence of an objective referent.

This is why the author of the commentary says because, in the absence of the object to be perceived, perception is not tenable.

upalambha upalabdhisvabhāvo nāpanīyate nāpyanupalabdhisvabhāvaḥ prakṣipyate /	The notion that perception has perception for its essential nature is not excluded, nor is it interpolated that it has nonperception for its essential nature.What is it then?

There are various modes of differentiation of the imagination of the unreal as being of the nature of the realms of sensedesire, form and formlessness.Since the differentiation itself is the characteristic, it is the characteristic of the differentiation because the imagination of the unreal is characterized by this differentiation.
prabhedalakṣaṇañca kimarthaṃ khyāpyate? abhūtaparikalpamātre kāmarūpadhātvorayogāt /	What is the reason that the characteristic of the differentiation is declared? Because the realms of sensedesire and form is not tenable if there is just the imagination of what is unreal.

Therein, vision in regard to the object alone consists in consciousness vision in regard to the particulars of the object consists in the mental concomitants, such as sensation.By demonstrating the particulars as belonging to the mind and the mental concomitants, he states the characteristic of the synonyms of the imagination of what is unreal.

Because the mind and the mental concomitants manifest as imaginative constructions in regard to. Since the vision of an objects essential nature and particulars consists in both the mental concomitants and unreal imagination they are included as synonyms, however, the particular does not exist in the object.
tatrārthamātre dṛṣṭir vijñānam iti /	Therein, the vision in regard to the object alone consists in consciousness.

sarveṣāṃ sāsravāṇāṃ dharmāṇāṃ bījam anubadhnāti anyeṣāñca pravṛttivijñānānāṃ hetupratyayo bhavatīti pratyayavijñānaṃ /	It is consciousness as causal condition since it is the basic causal condition for both the seeds of all impure dharmas that follow in consequence of it and for the other actual consciousnesses.
tat pratyayaṃ pravṛttijñānamoupabhogikam iti / tasmād ālayavijñānāt pratyetīti tat pratyayam utpadyata ityarthaḥ /	Actual consciousness, which pertains to senseexperience, has the latter for its causal condition what is meant is since it arises from that storeconsciousness, it is produced with the latter for its causal condition.
katham utpadyate ? pravṛttivijñānaṃ hy ālayavijñānāt pravartamānam anutpannasya taj jātīyasya pravṛttivijñānasyotpādakaṃ bījam ālayavijñāne paripuṣṇāti /	How does arise? The actual consciousness, while in the process of manifesting from the storeconsciousness, fosters in that storeconsciousness a seed which is the progenitor of an actual consciousness which has not yet arisen and which is of the same genre.
nanv ālayavijñānam apy aupabhogikaṃ pravṛttivijñānañca pratyayavijñānaṃ prasajyate aduḥkhāsukhavedanopabhogāśrayatvāt ālayavijñāne ca vāsanābhāvanāt / na pratyayabhāvavyatirekeṇānyā vāsanābhāvanā'sti /	this verse segment has been paraphrased cf. D0a. Bhaşya Da. Thus, that actual consciousness has that for its causal condition.Is it not so that the storeconsciousness also pertains to sense experience, and the actual consciousness can be construed as the consciousness as causal condition because the storeconsciousness is the basis of the senseexperience of nonpainful and nonpleasurable sensations and also because the latent impressions are activated in the storeconsciousness?
yathoktam abhidharmasūtragāthāyāṃ sarvadharmā hi ālīnā vijñāne teṣu tat tathā / anyonyaṃ phalabhāvena hetubhāvena sarvadā //	There is no other activation of the latent impressions except as causal conditions, as has been stated in this verse from the Abhidharmasutra All dharmas are collected in consciousness, and likewise the latter in the former as result and cause of each other, eternally.
iti /	Why?
na prasajyate tad vedanāyā durupalakṣYatvāt / na tadaupabhogikatvena lakṣyate pravṛttivijñānavat / prakarṣagataṃ vā jñeyaṃ sūryavat /	Because of the difficulty in distinguishing the sensation that belongs to it, the storeconsciousness is not recognized as being pertinent to senseexperience, like actual consciousness is, or it should be known as something preeminent, like the sun.
tathā hy upabhogatrividhavedanāśrayatvaṃ pravṛttivijñānasyaiva na tvālayavijñānasyeti / hetupratyayaścātra vivakṣito na pratyayamātraṃ /	Accordingly, only actual consciousness is the basis for the senseexperience of the three kinds of sensation the storeconsciousness is not.Moreover, in this context the store consciousness is intended as the basic causal condition, not just a causal condition.
tathā hi kuśalākuśaladharmādhipatyād ālayavijñānaṃ vipākaniṣyandaphalavāsanāṃ parigṛhṇāti / avyākṛtadharmādhipatyāc ca niṣyandaphalavāsanām eveti /	Likewise, under the influence of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas, the store consciousness incorporates the latent impressions consisting in both the karmaresult and the natural outcomeresult, whereas, under the influence of the undefined dharmas, it incorporates only the latent impressions that belong to the natural outcomeresult.
ata ālayavijñānaṃ niravaśeṣāṇāṃ sāsravadharmāṇāṃ hetupratyayaḥ /	Hence the store consciousness is the basic causal condition for all impure dharmas in their entirety.
pravṛttivijñānaṃ tu ālayavijñānasyādhipatipratyaya iti nāsti pravṛttivijñānasya pratyayatvaprasangaḥ /	However, actual consciousness is the predominant causal condition for the store consciousness. It is not the basic causal condition. Thus, that the actual consciousness is a causal condition is not a wrong conclusion.
upabhogo vedaneti /	This verse is also cited in MSG.
bhavarasasārasarūpā vedanā /	Sensation is like the essence of the flavor of existence.
tasmā bālās tat saṃvedanārthaṃ viṣayam abhiniviśante / na kevalaṃ vedanā arthopalabdhir apy upabhoga ityanye / tac ca na upabhogo vedaneti bhāṣyavirodhāt /	Due to the latter, naive people are attached to senseobjects for the sake of the full sensory experience of them.Others believe that senseexperience refers not just to sensation but also to the perception of objects, but this is not so because it is in contradiction with Vasubandhus commentary which states senseexperience refers to sensation.
arthopalabdhiś ca na vijñānād anyeti na tasyāścaitasatvaṃ prayujyate /	Moreover, since the perception of an object is not different from consciousness, it would not be logically tenable that it can be a mental concomitant.
veditaparicchedaḥ saṃjñā sukhādiviśeṣodgrahaṇātmakatvāt /	The discrimination of what has been sensed refers to ideation, because it consists in the apprehension of the particulars, such as what is pleasurable.
upabhoge saṃjñāyāñ ca prerakāḥ saṃskārā vijñānasya cetanāmanaskārādayaḥ /	The stimulations towards senseexperience and ideation refer to the formative forces of consciousness, volition and mental attention etc.
atha vā / upabhogo vedaneti yathāsvamālambanānubhāvāt sukhādivedanīyakarmānubhavanāc ca /	Alternatively, he says senseexperience refers to sensation, because one experiences an objective support according to its nature and because one experiences the karma of what is to be sensed as pleasure etc.
evaṃ viṣayakarmaṇor upabhuktir vedanety upabhogaḥ / viṣayacihnaṃ vyavahāranimittaṃ paricchinnaṃ karotīti paricchedaḥ saṃjñā / vijñānāntarālambana ābhogaḥ saṃskārāḥ / tataścetanādyādhipatyād vijñānam ālambanānantaraṃ bhajate / ādiśabdena chandhādayo gṛhyante /	Thus, since sensation consists in the sensory experience of both senseobjects and their karma, it is senseexperience.Discrimination refers to ideation since it discriminates the mark of the senseobject, i.e. its conventional sign. The stimulations towards different objective supports on the part of consciousness are the formative forces hence, through the influence of volition etc., consciousness partakes of a different objective support. Willpower and the like are referred to by the term etc.. The actualizing has now been described in terms of from whence it manifests, what kind of nature it possesses and its purpose. The Characteristic of Defilement. I. Due to concealing, implanting, conducting, encapsulating, completing, threefold discriminating, senseexperiencing and attracting Fettering, directing and suffering the world is defiled. In the above it is due to concealing, because of the obstruction of ones vision of phenomena as they are in reality, by ignorance. It is due to implanting, because of the establishment of the latent impressions of karma in consciousness, by the formative forces.It is due to conducting, because it is made to reach the place of rebirth, by consciousness.
samparigrahaṇān nāmarūpeṇātmabhāvasya /	It is due to encapsulating, of the individual nature by name form.
pūraṇāt ṣaḍāyatanena /	It is due to completing, by the six sensefields.
triparicchedāt sparśena /	It is due to threefold discriminating, by contact.
upabhogād vedanayā /	It is due to sense experiencing, through sensation.
karṣaṇāt tṛṣṇayā karmākṣiptasya punar bhavasya /	It is due to the attracting, of the new existence projected through karma, by craving.
nibandhanād upādānair vijñānasyotpatyanukūleṣu kāmādiṣu /	It is due to the fettering, of consciousness to the sensedesires etc. that are conducive to rebirth, through the graspings.
ābhimukhyād bhavena kṛtasya karmaṇaḥ puarnbhave vipākadānāyābhimukhīkaraṇāt /	It is due to directing, because the karma that has been performed is directed towards the provision of the karmaresult in the new existence, by becoming.
duḥKhanā jantyā jarāmaraṇena ca parikliśyate jagat /	It is due to suffering that the world is completely defiled, by birth, oldage and death.
sankleśalakṣaṇañca khyāpayatīti kleśakarmajanmasankleśā yathā pravartamānā jagataḥ parikleśāya bhavanti tat sankleśalakṣaṇaṃ / tathācā'satyapyātmaninabhūtaparikalpamātrāt saṃsāraḥ prajāyate iti pradarśanāthaṃ khyāpyate /	And all of these defilements manifest from the imagination of what is unreal. Now he states the characteristic of defilement. The characteristic of defilement refers to that mode in which the defilements of moral defilement, karma and rebirth, while in the process of manifesting, lead to the complete defilement of the world. Although it is insubstantial, samsāra is generated just from the imagination of what is unreal.
iti vistaraḥ /	In order to demonstrate this it is stated I.
so'yaṃ pravṛttipakṣamadhi dvādaśāngaḥ pratītyasamutpādo darśitaḥ /	These twelve elements of dependent origination are shown with reference to the actualizing side .
kena chādanāt kathaṃ vā chādanāt kliśyata iti ? ata āha avidyayā yathābhūtadarśanavibandhād iti / avidyayā hy adarśanātmakatvād bhūtadarśanaviṣaye pracchādite bhūtadarśanaṃ notpadyate'to bhūtadarśanotpattivibandhanād avidyā bhūtadarśanavibandhaḥ /	How is it that is defiled due to concealing and by what is it concealed? Hence he says because of the obstruction of vision as they are in reality, by ignorance.Since ignorance consists in the absence of vision, when the sphere of ones vision of reality is hidden, the vision of what is real does not arise. Consequently, because it obstructs the arising of ones vision of the real, ignorance is an obstruction to the arising of the vision of what is real.
bhūtadarśanaṃ punaḥ prādhānyena lokottaraprajñā tat pṛṣṭhodbhavatvāt tat pṛṣṭhalābhāt tad avagamāc ca tat prayoga iti śrutacintābhāvanāmayī bhūtadarśanam ity ucyate /	Furthermore, the vision of the real consists chiefly in supramundane wisdom.
bhūtadarśanavibandhād avidyā saṃskārāṇāṃ pratyaya ityevaṃ chādanād avidyayā kliśyate jagad iti /	Because it obstructs the vision of what is real, ignorance is described as the causal condition for the formative forces, thus it is said due to concealing by ignorance, the world is defiled.
ropaṇāt kliśyate jagad iti sambadhyate /	It is due to implanting that the world is defiled this is understood.
kena ropaṇāt kva kasya vetyata āha saṃskārair vijñāne karmavāsanāyā iti /	As to the agent, locus and object of implanting, he says of the latent impressions of karma in consciousness, by the formative forces.
tatra saṃskārā yat kāyikaṃ karma vācikaṃ mānasaṃ ca puṇyāpuṇyāniñjyasvarūpaṃ tat punar bhavam abhisaṃskarotīti saṃskāraḥ /	Therein, the formative forces consist in karma of body, speech and mind and its essential nature can be virtuous, nonvirtuous or neutral.

tathāhi tāny anutpannavidyasya punarbhavaṃ saṃskurvanti notpannavidyasya /	Accordingly, they bring about the new existence for one whose knowledge has not yet arisen, but not for one whose knowledge has arisen.

Just as it is the causal condition in general for the arising of the moral defilements that do arise, so too is it the causal condition for the volitions which arise from the latter.

Thus it is described as the causal condition for the formative forces.

From Anguttaranikaya III. into being on account of the manifestation of moral defilement and since there is the bond of conception in a new existence for one whose mind is defiled, the defilement that consists in rebirth is a cause .

upabhogahetuḥ sparśavedana iti / sakāraṇenānubhavena kuśalākuśalakarmavipākasyopabhogāt /	The cause of senseexperience is contact and sensation, because the senseexperience of wholesome and unwholesome karmaresult is on account of experience, together with its cause.

Alternatively, although there are not three separate segments that comprise the past, present and future in this regard, he nevertheless demonstrates that it does consist in karma, moral defilement and their result. Through the statement about twofold he demonstrates that this is merely cause and result and that no other agent of action nor agent of sensation is defiled in this regard. Alternatively, the cause refers just to karma and moral defilement in this context because it is seen that the presence or absence of rebirth is due to the presence or absence of these two hence, rebirth is indeed the result of them. Therefore, he demonstrates that there is neither cause nor result in this regard, but in every case there is a state possessing the five aggregates.Furthermore, two kinds of dependent origination have been demonstrated through the explanation of the sevenfold causes, namely that characterized by projection and that characterized by actualization.
tatrākṣepalakṣaṇaḥ pratītyasamutpādaḥ saptyabhir angair nirdiṣṭaḥ yenākṣīpyate yathākṣipyate yaccākṣipyate tat pradarśanāt /	Of these, that characterized by projection has been explained through the seven elements of dependent origination by demonstrating thet by which it is projected, the way in which it is projected and that which is projected.

It is not superfluous. If it were only stated that the nonexistence of the duality is the characteristic of emptiness, one would understand the nonexistence of the duality as just an independent reality, like the nonexistence of the horns of a hare, and not the fact that it consists in real nature, like the painfulness etc.

Moreover, reciprocal nonexistence, as having a single basis, is not tenable because basis is required in both cases. Therefore, because it appropriates the characteristic of the nonexistence of an existent, it has been shown that it indeed the absolute nonexistence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject that is emptiness. If emptiness has the nature of nonexistence, how can it be described as the absolute? Because it is the object of the highest direct intuition, like the impermanence of what is impermanent, but not because it is an entity. Moreover, this does not have a nonexistent ownbeing, because this ownbeing of that nonexistent, it I. c Neither exists nor does it not exist How can it be nonexistent? Because there is the nonexistence of the duality, for if it were an existent there would not be the absolute nonexistence of the duality, nor would there be the real nature of the imagination of what is unreal.How can it be not nonexistent?

The path would not be an objective support, like the individual characteristic of a dharma, because there would be no difference from the individual characteristic of that dharma.Therefore, since it would not be different from the individual characteristic, the universal characteristic would not be tenable.
tasyāpi dharmasvarūpavat parasparato bheda iti sāmānyatā hīyate /	Also, since it can be differentiated from something else, just as the essential nature of one dharma universality is lost.
tataś ca sāmānyalakṣaṇasyāpy abhāvaḥ bhedāpekṣatvāt sāmānyalakṣaṇasya /	Consequently, there would be no universal as well because the universal characteristic depends upon the fact of differentiation.

Because one who believes in the Nirgrantha doctrine does not make a distinction in regard to the difference or identity of something that truly exists.However, since emptiness is not an existent, there is no fault here.

However, this is not so when both i.e. defilement and purity are adventitious therefore, this process does not touch the real nature of change i.e. emptiness.

There is a twofold conceptual differentiation a the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject and b just this here is an aspect of the absolute according to what is seen through that knowledge of emptiness.

Alternatively, that knowledge is described as emptiness because it has emptiness for its object. The emptiness, of the existence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, of that is the emptiness of emptiness. Also, the way in which the latter, i.e. the internal sensefields etc., are seen through that knowledge of emptiness as the absolute in this context the emptiness of that aspect is the emptiness of the absolute. What is the reason? Because the absolute is empty of the imaginary nature. The other signgrasping referred to above is harmful to the meditative development of emptiness the essential nature of an entity is imputed upon that for the sake of which the bodhisattva aspires to the understanding of emptiness. In order to clearly understand this emptiness has been explained, beginning with.Sgrub par byed pa.

Furthermore, the bodhisattva aspires for the purity of the Buddha qualities. Because of the expression he aspires at the end, this expression is to be supplied in each case for example, what is intended is The bodhisattva aspires for the attainment of the dual virtues, and The bodhisattva aspires for the welfare of sentient beings, always. In short, he undertakes with this resolve I should strive for the attainment of all the Buddha qualities. This is why it is said he cultivates emptiness. The emptiness of that is described as the emptiness of all dharmas. What is cultivation in this context? The unimpeded engagement of cognition in regard to the object of cognition. Now the establishment of the fourteen emptinesses, beginning with internal and concluding with the emptiness of all dharmas, should be understood in this way.What again is emptiness in this regard, i.e. in regard to the enjoyer etc.?

Some say that it is in order to demonstrate the distinction between the mundane path and the supramundane path, for, the mundane path is defiled by the stain pertinent to its own level but not by that which belongs to a lower because the former is the counteragent to the latter.The supramundane path is impure because it is differentiated as weak, middling etc., however, it is pure due to the absence of impurity but not so in the case of emptiness.
na kliṣṭety uktvā punaścakṣurādibhyo viśeṣārtham ucyate nāśuddhetyanye cakṣurādayo hy anivṛttā'vyākṛtatvān na kliṣṭā na ca teṣāṃ sāravatvāt prakṛtiviśuddhir ity aśuddheti / evaṃ na'pi sā kliṣṭeti cheduchyate na ṣuddheti kuśalasāsravāt viśeṣaṇārthamāḥ /	Again, after describing emptiness as undefiled, others describe it as not impure in order to distinguish it from the sensefaculties of sight etc., because sight etc. are not Ys text paraphrases this verse. Thus, after describing it as undefiled, it is described as impure in order to distinguish it from wholesome elements which are accompanied by impurity because that which is wholesome and accompanied by impurity is not undefiled since it belongs to samsāra and is pure because it has an agreeable karmaresult.
iṣtavipākatvāc ca śuddhaṃ naiva dharmatā / sā hi kliṣṭā'vasthāyām aśuddhaiveti /	Real nature is definitely not so, for, in the defiled state it is described as defiled and consequently as being impure.
evaṃ śūnyatāyāḥ sankleśaviśuddhyoddiṣṭaḥ prabhedaḥ sādhito bhavati ////	In this way, the differentiation of emptiness, by way of defilement and purity, that has been listed is proven.

Of these, in terms of characteristic includes both the characteristic of nonexistence and the characteristic of existence.It should be known in terms of the characteristic of nonexistence because of the statement the nonexistence of the duality. It should be known in terms of the characteristic of existence because of the statement which consists in the existence of a nonexistent.
bhāvalakṣaṇataś ca na bhāvo nā'pi cā'bhāva iti vacanāt /	Furthermore, the characteristic of existence. Because of the statement it neither exists nor does it not exist.
bhāvābhāvavinirmuktalakṣaṇatas tattvānyatva vinirmuktalakṣaṇaś ceti / etac ca śūnyatāyā lakṣaṇaṃ /	Refers to both the characteristic as devoid of existence and nonexistence and the characteristic as devoid of identity and difference, because of the statement this is the characteristic of emptiness.
tasmād abhūtaparikalpān na pṛthaktvaikalakṣaṇam iti vacanāt /	Therefore, in relation to the imagination of what is unreal. The characteristic consists neither in difference nor identity.
evaṃ lakṣaṇataḥ piṇḍārthaḥ /	This is the summary meaning in terms of characteristic.

karmalakṣaṇam anadhimuktānāṃ śūnyatālakṣaṇāśratyātrāsasya pratipakṣeṇa / abhrāntitathatā karmā'viparyāsakarma sarvanimittaprahāṇakarma sarvalokottarajñānaviṣayatvā'vasthānakarma pratilabdhāryadharmahetubhāvakarma ca /	The characteristic of karma acts as the counteragent to fear for those who, after learning of the characteristic of emptiness, do not have firm conviction, for example, the karma that pertains to the realization of thusness that is free from error, the karma that pertains to the absence of erroneous inversion, the karma that pertains to the relinquishment of all signs, the karma that exists in the sphere of all supramundane direct intuition and in regard to the objective support, the karma that pertains to the causal ground of the noble qualities.

madhyāntavibhāgaśāstre lakṣaṇaparicchedasya prathamasya ṭīkā //	Chapter Two The Obscurations. With reference to the obscurations, he says II. abc. The Five Obscurations Beginning with the Pervading.
%āvaraṇaparicchedo dvitīyaḥ {tatra vyāpi kleśajñeyā''varaṇaṃ bodhisattvagotrakāṇāṃ sākalyāt /	Of these, the pervading refers to obscuration consisting in both moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it forms the totality.
prādeśikaṃ kleśā''varaṇaṃ śrāvakādigotrakāṇāṃ / udriktaṃ teṣām eva rāgādicaritānāṃ /	The limited refers to obscuration consisting in moral defilement and is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc. The excessive refers to obscuration that pertains only to those who course in passion etc.
samaṃ samabhāgacaritānāṃ /	The equal refers to obscuration that pertains to those who course in equal shares.
saṃsārā''dānatyāgā''varaṇaṃ bodhisattvagotrakāraṇaṃ apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇā''varaṇāt / ity etad yathāyogam ubhayeṣām āvaraṇam ākhyātaṃ bodhisattvagotrakāṇāṃ śrāvakādigotrakāṇāñca /	The obscuration comprising the acceptance and rejection of samsāra is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it is an obscuration to the nirvana wherein the bodhisattva is not permanently fixed.Thus these obscurations are elucidated respectively as being pertinent to both, i.e., as pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva as well as those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc.
lakṣaṇanirdeśānantaram nāvaraṇanirdeśā'vasaraḥ, tadanantaramuddiṣṭatvādityāha āvaraṇamadhikṛtyāha /	Immediately after the explanation of the characteristic is an appropriate place for the explanation of obscuration and since was mentioned immediately following the former, says with reference to the obscurations, says II.
dvayāvaranamākhyātam dvayāvaraṇam, bodhisattvagotrakāṇāṃ śrāvakādigotrakāṇāñcāvaraṇam / āvaraṇīyārthabhedenāvaraṇasya bhinnatvaṃ pradarśayitum ayaṃ śloka ārabdhaḥ /	The obscurations that pertain to the two refer to obscurations pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva and those who belong to the spiritual Lineage of the śrävaka etc.This verse has been composed in order to demonstrate that the differentiation among the obscurations is in accordance with the difference in benefit that is obscured.
tatra vyāpi kleśajñeyāvaraṇaṃ bodhisattvagotrakāṇām iti /	Of these, the pervading refers to obscuration consisting in both moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.
vyāpnotīti vyāpi, sakalārthāvaraṇāt / sakalārtho hi svārthaḥ parārthaś ca /	It is the pervading since it pervades or permeates. Because it is an obscuration in regard to the totality of benefit the totality of benefit is both benefit for oneself and benefit for others.
athavā dvividhaṃ kleśaṃ jñeyaṃ cāvaraṇaṃ bodhisattvasya vyāpnotītyupacārād vyāpyucyate /	Alternatively, it is described as the pervading since it pervades the obscuration that pertains to the bodhisattva according to the designation of the two as obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable.
kleśa evāvaraṇamityāvaraṇasya kleśadharmatvena sārūpyādihopakleśo'pi kleśaśabdena gṛhyate / anyathā navadhā kleśalakṣaṇaṃ / ityatrerṣyāmātsarye na gṛhyetām, tayorupakleśatvāt /	Since moral defilement is itself an obscuring, it is an obscuration. Herein, secondary defilement is also referred to by the word moral defilement because it is exactly similar in its nature as moral defilement.Otherwise, the words the characteristic of moral defilement is ninefold would not include envy and avarice since these two are both secondary defilements.
jñeya evāvaraṇam iti jñeyāvaraṇam /	It is an obscuration that consists in the knowable because it is an obscuration in regard to the knowable.
tena jñeyaprāvṛtatvāj jñānasya viṣaya eva nāsti /	Since that which is knowable is concealed on account of this, it is not the sphere of knowledge.
jñāne vā jñeyāvaraṇaṃ, jñeyasya jñānotpattipratibandhakatvād iti jñeyāvaraṇamityatra madhyamapadalopo draṣṭavyaḥ / tailapātram iva /	Alternatively, it is an obscuring of direct intuition in regard to the knowable because it creates an obstruction to the arising of direct intuition in regard to the knowable. There is the omission of the word of between the words obscuration and knowable as in the compound a pot of oil.
tatpunarakliṣṭamajñātam /	Furthermore, it consists in undefiled nescience.
bodhisattvagotrakāṇāṃ asvaparārthasampatprakarṣalābhāya buddhatvaprāptaye puṇyajñānasambhāraṃ sarvathā sarvatrā'nutiṣṭhatāṃ tad dvayam api pratibandhakabhūtam / ityatastadāvaraṇaṃ vyavasthāpyate bodhisattvagotrakāṇām /	Those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva endeavour in every way to produce the accumulations of merit and direct intuition for the sake of the attainment of Buddhahood since it is the culminating attainment in regard to benefit for both oneself and others.Because both are obscurations to the latter they are determined as obscurations pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.
tatra vyāpi sarvaviṣayaṃ sakalaṃ sarvathā vyāpnoti / kathaṃ sakalaṃ vyāpnotīti jñāyata iti cet sākalyādāvaraṇaṃ vyāpītyucyate iti hetunirdeśāt /	In this respect, given that the pervading has the whole for its domain and the expression the totality means in every respect, how does the totality intimate pervading? It is described as obscuration that pervades because it forms the totality by way of its explanation as a cause.
atha vā vyāpiśabdo niravaśeṣārtha iti pradarśanāya sākalyādivacanam /	Alternatively, the statement because it forms the totality is made in order to explain the word pervading as having the meaning of totality.

Because if it is determined that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to them, then in that case, undefiled nescience is not an obscuration pertinent to them because śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas attain enlightenment even though it exists.
nanvajñānaṃ duḥkhādisatyaviṣaye jñānotpattipratibaṃdhakatvam eva śrāvakādīnām /	Is nescience on the part of the śrävaka etc. not an obscuration to the arising of knowledge in regard to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc.?
tatas teṣām api dvayāvaraṇaṃ bhavet /	Therefore, the two obscurations would be pertinent to them as well.
tasmān na vaktavyaṃ kleśāvaraṇaṃ śrāvakādigotrakāṇām iti /	Consequently, perhaps it should not be said that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to śrävakas etc.?
naitadevam, ajñānaṃ hi kleṣṭaṃ jñānapratipakṣabhūtaṃ saṃsāramūlaṃ ca kleśṣāvaraṇameveti vyavasthāpyate, na tu jñeyāvaraṇaṃ, saṃśaya iva / yathā vimatir hi duḥkhādisatyaviṣaye vicikitsā kleśaścocyate na tu viṣayāntare /	This is not so, since ignorance is determined just as obscuration that consists in moral defilement because it is defiled, it is adverse to knowledge and it is the root of samsāra. However it is not determined as obscuration that consists in the knowable, like uncertainty.For example, uncertainty in regard to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc. is not in regard to other spheres described as doubt and moral defilement, for it is only uncertainty in regard to another sphere and not defilement nor doubt.
evavṃ duḥkhasatyādiviṣaye evā'jñānamavidyā kleśaścocyate, na tu viṣayāntare / viṣayāntare tvajñānam eva, na cā'vidyā naiva kleśaḥ /	Similarly, nescience in regard to just the sphere of the truth of suffering etc. is ignorance and moral defilement but not in regard to other spheres, for in regard to other spheres it is only nescience and not ignorance nor moral defilement.
tasmāt tasya jñeyajñānamātrapravṛttāvāvaraṇatvāt tajñeyāvaraṇam ucyate na hi kleśakarmajanmanāmapi, tāni cotpadyanta evāvidyāyā eva /	Therefore, since described as the obscuration that consists in the knowable because it is an obscuration to the emergence of only the direct intuition of what is knowable, moral defilement, karma and rebirth are not produced as is ignorance.
yadyevaṃ bodhisattvānām āvaraṇaṃ na vyavasthāpyate /	If this be so, cannot be determined as the obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas.
naitadevam, bodhisattvānāṃ hi śrutasambhāraprabhāvitatvāt teṣāmāvaraṇaṃ jñeyāvaraṇam / taduktam āryho'pyagyūḥ pañca vidyāpadāni nārabhya syāt kadāpi sarvajñaḥ / tato'nyeṣāṃ nigrahā'nugrahārthaṃ svajñānārthaṃ vā'rabhet tatra yatnam //	This is not so obscuration that consists in the knowable is the obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas because they are characterized by the accumulations of learning.It is said Without applying himself to the five kinds of learning, in no way can a Supremely Noble One arrive at omniscience thus, he applies himself to these, either to restrain or assist others or, for his own knowledge.
udṛktaṃ tu mṛdvapi rāgādivastu teṣām eva bodhisattvagotrakāṇāṃ rāvakādigotrakāṇañcā'dhimātramabhīkṣṇaṃ ca pravartitaṃ rāgādicaritānām āvaranam iti /	The excessive even a small aspect of passion etc. that manifests continually and to an excessive degree in those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva. This verse is from MSA XI.
yeṣāṃ mṛdāvapi viṣaye rāgādīnām anyatamat adhimātramabhīkṣṇyaṃ ca pravartate te rāgādicaritāḥ /	refers to pertinent to those who course in passion etc. Those who course in passion and the like refers to those for whom any passion manifests continuously and to an excessive degree even in regard to a miserable things.
samaṃ punasteṣām eva bodhisattvagotrakāraṇaṃ śrāvakādigotrakāṇāñcāvaraṇam / samaṃ hi prakāradvittvābhāvāt /	The equal i.e., obscuration pertinent to both those belonging to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva and those belonging to the spiritual lineage of the śrāvaka etc.It is equal because the two modes are absent refers to pertinent to those who course in equal shares.
samabhāgacaritānām āvaraṇam iti yeṣāṃ viṣayasādṛśye {sāmīpye?} kleśa utpadyate na tvabhīkṣṇaṃ te samabhāgacaritāḥ /	They who course in equal shares refers to those for whom moral defilement manifests in conformity with the object, but not continuously.
saṃsārādānatyāgāvaranamityādi /	The obscuration comprising the acceptance and rejection of samsāra.
bhodisattvo hi kāruṇyādhipattyāt saṃsāramupādatte, prajñādhipattyāc ca saṃsāradoṣaṃ yathābhūtaṃ dṛṣṭvā tyajati /	The bodhisattva accepts samsāra on account of his compassion yet, on account of his wisdom, after observing the evil of samsara as it is in reality, he rejects it.
tataḥ kleśābhāve'pi sattvākicanāj janmaparigraho'pratiṣṭhataṃ nirvāṇam, saṃsāranirvāṇayor dvayorapratiṣṭhitatvāt /	Consequently, although free from moral defilement , having regard for sentient beings, he takes rebirth in the nirväpa not permanently fixed, because he is not permanently fixed in samsara or nirvāṇa.
tadāvaraṇantu kleśābhibhūtena yathā saṃsāramupādāya yathābhūtadoṣādarśanāccā'kṛpayā parityajanam /	The obscuration to this consists in the acceptance of samsāra as being overcome by moral defilement or the complete rejection of samsăra without compassion, after observing its evil as it is in reality.
ajñānamihāvaraṇamucyate kṛpāprajñayoḥ pratibandhakatvādityanye / athavā yathoktaṃ mahāratnakūṭe sa āśayena nirvāṇe tiṣṭhati, saṃsāre ca prayogeṇa tiṣṭhatīti /	Others believe that nescience is described as an obscuration herein because it is an obstruction to both compassion and wisdom.Alternatively, as has been stated in the Maharatnakūta His mental disposition is directed towards nirvāṇa but his application is directed towards samsara.
etaddhi bodhisattvānām apratiṣṭhitaṃ nirvāṇam /	This is the unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva.
tatra nirvāṇapṛṣṭhībhāvād āśayaprayogābhyāṃ saṃsāramupādatte, agotrasthasattva iva /	In this regard, in order to turn his back on nirvāṇa he accepts samsāra with his mental disposition and application, just like a sentient being who has no spiritual lineage.
tathā ca saṃsārapṛṣṭhībhāvānnirvāṇagatābhyāmāśayaprayogābhyāṃ saṃsāraṃ tyajati, śrāvakādigotrakā iva /	Similarly, in order to turn his back on samsāra, he completely rejects samsāra with both his mental disposition and application directed towards entering nirvāṇa, just like those who belong to the spiritual lineage of śrävakas etc.
evaṃ saṃsārādānaṃ tatparityajanaṃ ca bodhisattvagotrakāṇāmapratiṣṭhitanirvāṇāvaraṇam, saṃsāranirvāṇayorekāntapatitatvāt /	Thus, both the acceptance of samsāra and its rejection are obscurations in regard to the unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva because they both constitute a falling to one extreme away from samsāra as well as nirvāṇa.
bodhisattvās tu tathāgatatvaprāptikāle kleśajñeyāvaraṇaprahāṇāt saṃsāre na tiṣṭhanti nirupadhiśeṣe nirvāṇe ca, dharmakāyaprabandhān na tiṣṭhanti nirvāṇe śrāvakādivat /	At the time that they become tathāgatas, bodhisattvas do not remain in samsāra because they have relinquished both the obscurations that consist in moral defilement and the knowable.And because the Dharma Body continues without interruption in the nirvana devoid of the remnants of should probably read gton bas in place of ston pas.
tataḥ saṃsāranirvāṇayor ubhayhatrāpi na pratiṣṭhantīti /	Thus they are not fixed permanently in samsāra or nirvāņa.

itarad dvayaṃ punarubhayeṣām āvaraṇamākhyātam /	The other two i. e. the excessive and the equal are obscurations pertinent to both.
tatra ca jñeyāvaraṇaṃ bodhisattvānām āvaraṇam uktam / taccā'kliṣṭamajñānam iti //	In the above, obscuration that consists in the knowable has been described as obscuration that pertains to the bodhisattvas, moreover, it is known as undefiled nescience.Furthermore, II.

tatra satkāyadṛṣṭiḥ pañcasūpādānaskandheṣvātmata ātmīyato veti darśanaṃ /	In the above, the false view of individuality refers to the notion that there is a self or what pertains to a self among the five aggregates that have been appropriated.
antagrāhadṛṣṭir hi tasminnevātmābhikalpitabhāve śāśvatadarśanam ucchedadarśanaṃ vā /	The false view that consists in the grasping of extremes concerns that same entity that has been construed as a self and refers to the notion that it is eternal or that it perishes.
yena darśanena hetuṃ vā phalaṃ vā kriyā vā sad vā vastu apavadate mithyā vā parikalpayati tan mithyādṛṣṭiḥ /	Wrong view refers to that notion on account of which one negates an entity, whether it be cause, result, deed or an actual existent, or else wrongly construes it.
nirodhasatyaparijñānaṃ śāntādibhir ākaraiḥ /	The clear comprehension of the truth. This passage is also different.
katham punas tat tasyāvaraṇam ityata āha satkāyāntagrāhadṛṣṭibhyāntaduttrāsāt mithyādṛṣṭyā cā'pavādād iti /	Just how can false view be an obscuration to that clear comprehension? Hence he says because the fear of the latter i. e. cessation is on account of the false views of both individuality and the grasping of extremes and is also due to negation by wrong view.
tatra satkāyāntagrāhadṛṣṭibhyām ahaṃ tatra na bhaviṣyāmīti nirodhād uttrasyati mithyādṛṣṭyā cā'pavadate nāstyeva nirodha iti /	Therein, on account of the false views of individuality and the grasping of extremes one fears cessation, thinking I will not exist in that state, also, on account of wrong view one negates it, thinking there is indeed no cessation.
tatra satkāyāntagrāhadṛṣṭibhyāṃ śāntataḥ praṇītato nissaraṇataś ca na parijānāti mithyādṛṣṭyā nirodhato na parijānāti /	In this respect, on account of the false views of individuality and the grasping of extremes, one does not clearly comprehend cessation as tranquil, sublime and as escape yet on account of wrong view one does not comprehend it as cessation.
tatra parāmarśasaṃyojanaṃ dṛṣṭiparāmarśaḥ śīlavrataparāmarśaśca / tatra dṛṣṭiparāmarśo dṛṣṭau dṛṣṭyāśrayeṣu ca pañcasūpādānaskandheṣu yad utkarṣādito darśanaṃ / śīlavrataparāmarśaḥ śīlaṃ vrataṃ tad ubhayaṃ tadāśrayān vā pañcopādānaskandhān śuddhito muktito nairyāṇikato vā samanupaśyato yad darśanaṃ tacchīlavrataparāmarśaḥ / mārgasya parijñānam punar nairyāṇikādibhir ākāraiḥ / katham punaḥ parāmarśasaṃyojanaṃ mārgaparijñāna āvaraṇam ityata āha anyathā 'praśuddhiparāmarśanād iti /	In this way the fetter that consists in false view becomes an obscuration in the clear comprehension of cessation.The fetter of clinging is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the truth of the path. Therein, the fetter of clinging refers to both the clinging to false view and the clinging to morality and vows. Clinging to false view therein refers to that notion in regard to false view and the five aggregates that have been appropriated and which are the basis of false view, as being preeminent and so on. Clinging to morality and vows refers to that notion on the part of one who perceives either morality, vows, both of these or the five aggregates that have been appropriated and which are the basis of that notion, as being equivalent to purity, liberation or definitive liberation. Furthermore, the clear comprehension of the path is in accordance with aspects, such as definitive liberation. Just how can the fetter of clinging be an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the path? Hence he says because one clings to the highest purity with the wrong motive i.e. because one clings to purity as either a just morality and vows, b an abode of pleasure pertinent to sensedesire, c ascetic practices or d the knowledge of enumerations etc.By clinging to a false view on account of just which one believes in purity, one clings to that same view as being preeminent.
katham ityato bravīti tad guṇā'nabhiśraddhānād iti /	As to how this can be so, he says because of the lack of true belief in their virtues.

atraiva kāraṇam āha tad doṣā'darśanād iti /	Here now he gives the reason because one does not perceive the faults of the latter.

mātsaryaṃ pariṣkāre'ṣv avyavasito rāgāṃśikaścetasa upakaraṇeṣv āgrahaḥ /	Avarice which has passion for a component refers to miserliness of mind in regard to goods and chattels on the part of one who is intent upon the necessities of life.

The remainder are obscurations to the understanding of reality for one who has already applied himself in such an endeavor.
tadyathā'vaśyaṃ prathamam eva mumukṣūṇāṃ saṃsārāc citttam udvejayitavyaṃ /	For this very reason the sequential order of these fetters is given for example, one who desires liberation should, from the very beginning, necessarily cause his mind to shrink from samsāra.
tataḥ sarvata upekṣeṇa bhavitavyaṃ /	Following from that, he should have equanimity towards everything.
tataḥ sarvā'narthamūlatvāt satkāyadṛṣṭiḥ parijñeyā / tad anantaraṃ dukḥ samudayātmakatvena tadvastu parijñeaṃ/	After that, the false view of individuality should be clearly comprehended because it is the root of all misfortune.Then, the foundation of the latter should be clearly comprehended as consisting in suffering and its arising.
tatastannirodho vijñeyaḥ/	Then, the cessation of the latter should be understood.

nanu sarvasyāpi sarvatrāvaraṇatvena saṃbhavād vastupratiniyamenāvaraṇanirdeśo na yuktaḥ /	Since it is possible that obscuration can pertain to all the fetters at all times, the explanation of obscuration as restricted to each individual foundation is not tenable.In both cases.

Since enlightenment cannot be understood by way of ownbeing through words alone, he describes it as Some believe that since the obscurations to virtue and enlightenment are explained as independent, as are complete acceptance etc., they are discerned in this context just as independent but not as things that can be listed and explained.This is not so the obscuration to arising is determined in relation to virtue and it is common to such things as the resolve for enlightenment because of the necessity for the production of that virtue.

One does not apply oneself on account of any moral defilement, whether it be carelessness or laziness. Or else, one does not apply oneself to that particular condition, whether it be undefined or defiled, that possesses the seed of moral defilement.It is described as the lack of application since one does not apply oneself continually or respectfully because ones application is insignificant but not because of an absence of application, because if the latter were the case there would be no possibility of obscuration.

atas tathatālambanādyo nirodhaḥ sa prakṛtinirodha ity ucyate / niruddhamātraṃ pratisaṃkhyānirodhaḥ /	Hence, since it has thusness for its objective support, this cessation is described as cessation by way of intrinsic nature, whereas cessation alone is described as cessation through critical consideration.
nirodhyate'syām iti nirodhastathatetyapare /	Others believe that cessation is equivalent to thusness inasmuch as suffering has ceased in the latter.
nirodhasya punar anutpādātmakatvāt sarve svabhāvānutpattyādikaṃ saṃkṣipya nirodhasatyam ity ucyate /	Furthermore, since cessation consists in nonorigination, after collecting together all elements that have nonorigination etc. for their ownbeing, they are described as the truth of cessation.

ālambanabhāvena vyavasthānād ityarthaḥ / jñānā'pṛthaktvāt tasmin kāla ālambanaṃ na vartate vijñaptimātrapratibhāsavat / tadyathā yeṣāṃ vijñaptimātraṃ kṣamate na teṣāṃ rūpādivijñaptimātraṃ muktvā rūpādipratibhāsā vidyante / prāptiparamārtho nirvāṇaṃ ekāntanirmatathatāśrayaparāvṛttilakṣaṇam / kathaṃ paramārtha ityata āha paramo'rtha iti kṛtvā /	What is meant is because it is determined as being an.However, since it is not something that is separate from direct intuition, at the time it does not become an objective support, like the appearances as representationonly for example, apart from their mere representation as form etc., the appearances as form etc. do not exist for those for which representationonly is allowed b The absolute as attainment is nirvāpa thusness which is absolutely devoid of stain is the characteristic of the turning about of the basis. How can this be the absolute? Hence he says considering that it is the highest objecti, i. e. considering that it is both an object and is the highest, it is the highest object. It is the highest in this regard because it is foremost among the unconditioned and conditioned dharmas it is an object in the sense that it is the aim of the path. For thus, the attainment of nirvana is the aim of the path but nirvāṇa is the object because it is free from all harmful faults since that which is accompanied by fault is described as a nonobject.The absolute as spiritual practice is the path why is this?
viṣayaḥ prayojanaṃ vārthaḥ / viṣayas tathatā prayojanaṃ nirvāṇaṃ /	Considering that the highest is its object object here means object or aim the object is thusness, the aim is nirvana.
viṣayadvāreṇa parama ucyamāne katham anyo'nyasamarthanaṃ na syāt ? anyo'nyasamarthanaṃ cet ko doṣa iti ? niścayābhāvaḥ /	If it is described as the highest on account of the object, would there not be a reciprocal dependence? If there is reciprocal dependence, what fault is there? There can be no positive determination.
naivaṃ bhaviṣyaty anyonyasamarthanāt siṃhavanavat /	This will not be so because there is reciprocal dependence as in the case of a lion and a forest.
katham asaṃskṛtaṃ nirvāṇākhyaṃ saṃskṛtaṃ ca mārgākhyaṃ pariniṣpannasvabhāva ucyate ? paramārthasatyaṃ hi pariniṣpannasvabhāvo nirdiṣṭaṃ /	How can both the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the conditioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature?
mārgas tu pariniṣpannon na yujyate / na pūrvāparabhāgābhāva iti kṛtvā / tasmān na mārgaḥ paramārthasatyaṃ na cā'pariniṣpanne paramārthasatyasaṃgraha iti /	For absolute truth has been explained as the perfected nature, however, it is not tenable that the path be perfected considering that it has no nonexistent previous and subsequent portions.Therefore, the path is not equivalent to absolute truth and if it is not perfected it cannot be included within absolute truth.

athavā katham asaṃkṛtaṃ nirvāṇākhyaṃ saṃskṛtañca mārgākhyaṃ pariniṣpannasvabhāva ucyate / pariniṣpanno hi tathatā /	III. cd The two are considered by way of perfection that is both unchanging and free from erroneous inversion. An alternate objection how can the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the conditioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature?
eṣā ca dvayalakṣaṇarahitatvaṃ paratantrasyeti na nirvāṇamārgayoḥ pariniṣpannatā yujyate /	For the perfected refers to thusness and since it is devoid of the characteristic of the duality that pertains to the otherdependent, the condition of perfection on the part of both nirvana and the path is not tenable.
tadidam avācyaṃ yatas tatra dvayābhāvaḥ pariniṣpanna eva / na tu dvayābhāva eva pariniṣpanna iti tad anyapratiṣedhaḥ / atas tad anyac ca / nirvikārā'viparyāsapariniṣpattito dvayam api pariniṣpanna iti sambaddhyate asaṃskṛtaṃ nirvāṇaṃ tathatā ca /	Response this objection is not tenable since the nonexistence of the duality therein refers to the perfected, however, it is only the nonexistence of the duality that is referred to as the perfected, thus what is other than this is not refuted.And hence the two perfected natures other than this which comprise the absence of change and the absence of erroneous inversion are also referred to as perfected. The unconditioned refers to nirvana and thusness.
asaṃskṛtam ananyathābhāvād avikārapariniṣpattyā pariniṣpannaṃ /	The unconditioned is perfected insofar as it is equivalent to unchanging perfection because it cannot be otherwise.
saṃskṛtaṃ mārgasaṃgṛhītaṃ nānyatra / aviparyāsapariniṣpattyā pariniṣpannam iti sambadhyate /	The conditioned, which is incorporated in the truth of the path and not elsewhere, is perfected insofar as it is equivalent to perfection free from erroneous inversion.
katham ityato 'bravīt punar jñeyavastuviparyāsād iti / yasmān na punar jñeye viparyāsam āpadyate tasmān na mārgo'pi pariniṣpanna ityataśca dvayor api saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtayoḥ pariniṣpannatvaṃ pṛthag abhiprāyād ityavirodhaḥ ////	As to why this is so, he says because of the absence of erroneous inversion in regard to the entity that is the object of knowledge i.e. since erroneous inversion never occurs in regard to the object of knowledge. Therefore, the path is also perfected and consequently, due to the differences in intended meaning, the assertion that the perfected nature pertains to both the conditioned and the unconditioned is not contradictory.
{ prasiddhatattvaṃ } tatra lokaprasiddham ekasmāt iti /	There is a similarity in the perspective of all worldlings insofar as their intellects enter into familiarity.

However, its essential nature is not known, hence he says in regard to entities etc. the conventional symbol refers to knowledge which connects the name and the possessor of the name. Familiarity.
saṃstavas tasya vāramvāramprayogadarśanaṃ / tatrā'nupraviṣṭayā buddhyeti / kaḥ punar buddheḥ saṃketasaṃstavānupraveśaḥ ? tat smaraṇāt /	. . this refers to the endeavour and perspective that is repeatedly oriented towards that conventional symbol.Insofar as their intellects enter into the latter two just what does this entry into familiarity with conventional symbols by the intellect refer to? It refers to memory.
etad uktaṃ bhavati saṃketasaṃstavānusmaraṇānugatatyā buddhyā sarveṣāṃ laukikānāṃ śāstravidāṃ tad avidāṃ ca vyāhṛtibhāve kvacit pṛthyvyeveyam ityādivaṃśādidarśanatulyateti /	This is what is being said there is a similarity in the perspective of all worldlings, i.e. those who know the treatises and those who do not, in regard to things that are conventionally expressed, insofar as their intellect is in conformity with their memory which has familiarity with the conventional symbol.
trividham api hi svabhāvam adhikṛtya yuktiḥ kriyata iti / ataḥ svabhāvatrayeṇa yuktiprasiddhatvaṃ vyavasthāpyate /	That which is established through reasoning results from the three Since reasoning is carried out in regard to the threefold natures, the reality that is well established through reasoning is respectively determined through the three natures.
tac ca na vijñāyata ityataḥ pradarśayann āha yat satāṃ yuktārthapaṇḍitānām ityādi /	In order to demonstrate this since it is not known, he says that... by those who are wise, i.e. learned in argumentation.
tatra santo ye yuktārthapaṇḍitāḥ /	Therein, those who are wise refers to those who are learned in argumentation.
pūrvasya vyākhyānāśayasya paścān nirdeśoktiḥ / athavā santo'nveṣakāḥ kiṃ kuśalam iti /	The dialecticians refers to the examiners after thinking about the explanation of the former, the latter term is stated.Alternatively, those who are wise are the seekers for what is wholesome.
yuktā'rthapaṇḍitā apekṣākāryakāraṇopapattidharmatāyukticatuṣṭayā'viruddhārthakṛtakauśalāḥ /	Those who are learned in argumentation are those whose skill is complete in regard to the noncontradictory meaning of the four types of reasoning which consist in consideration, cause and effect, proof of logical possibility and real nature.
tārkikās tuhapohasamarthās tathāgatapravacanasamāśrayeṇā viparītaśāstrapraṇetāraḥ /	The dialecticians are those who have the capacity for conjecture and exclusion and are the authors of the treatises that are free from erroneous inversion for they are based upon the scriptural statements of the tathāgatas.
mīmāṃsakāḥ svaparaśāstrapaṇḍitāḥ śreyodoṣaparīkṣakāḥ /	The examiners are learned in their own and others treatises and are scrutineers of virtues and faults.
kecit mīmāṃsakā iti na paṭhanti / ta evam āhuḥ satām ityukte ke punaḥ santaḥ ityata āha yuktārthapaṇḍitā iti /	However, some people do not read examiners, consequently, they query just who these wise ones are when it is said on the part of those who are wise.
tasmāt tārkikā ity ucyanta iti /	Hence, Vasubandhu says those who are learned in argumentation.
teṣāṃ ca kaścil lokaprasiddhānusārītyata āha pramāṇatrayaṃ niśrityeti pramāṇatrayāvirodhena / pramāṇatrayaṃ punaḥ pratyakṣam anumānam āgamaś ca /	Moreover, the latter are of two types because they can be situated on the level of dialectic or on the level of meditative development therefore, the dialecticians are specified.Since certain of these people are investigators of what is generally established, he says based upon the three means of valid knowledge.
trirūpalingenānumeuyārthajñānam anumānaṃ /	What is meant is since there is no contradiction with the three means of valid knowledge.
āptāḥ punar anṛtahetuvimuktāḥ / athavā pratyakṣānumānāgamaprasiddhena hetunā dṛṣṭāntena ca tat prasiddhasyaiva sādhyasya paramprati sādhyatvāt pramāṇatrayaṃ niśrityeti /	Ys reconstruction of pūrvasya vyākhyānā cannot be correct, however a suitable Sanskrit reconstruction is difficult to formulate. Alternatively, he says based upon the three means of valid knowledge because the probandum that has been established can be proved for others by means of the reason and example established through direct perception, inference and scriptural tradition.
upapattisādhanayuktyā prasiddhaṃ vastu iti / upapattis trirūpaṃ lingaṃ sādhyapratipādanopāyatvāt /	An entity is established through reasoning which consists in the proof of logical possibility logical possibility refers to the three types of mark because they are the means of substantiating the probandum.
upapatteḥ sādhanam upapattisādhanaṃ trirūpalingākhyānaṃ tena tat pratipādanāt / yuktir upāyo yena prayoganiyamena lingasya trirūpyam ākhyāyate /	The term proof of logical possibility is a tatpurușa compound.The three types of inferential mark are mentioned because the substantiation of that proof is on account of these. Reasoning is the means, through the specific formulation of which, all that pertains to the three types of inferential mark is stated.
athavopapātir ananyathāsambhavaḥ /	Alternatively, the logical possibility is that which is not possible otherwise.
sādhanyuktir avayavasambandhaḥ / upapatteḥ sādhanayuktir iti vigrahaḥ / athavopapattir eva sādhanayuktir iti vigrahaḥ /	The reasoning that consists in its proof refers to the train of thought that connects the component parts of a syllogism thus is the resolution of the term reasoning that consists in the proof of logical possibility upapattisādhanayukti, Alternatively, it may be resolved as the reasoning that consists in the proof is logically possible i.e. as a karmadhārya compound.
anyasādhanayuktibhyo vyavacchedārtham upapattigrahaṇaṃ /	The term logical possibility is employed in order to distinguish this from the other reasonings of proof.
evaṃ pramāṇatrayaṃ niśrityopapattisādhana yuktyā yat prasiddhaṃ vastu trayāṇāṃ bhāvanām anyatamat tad yuktiprasiddham ucyate /	In this way, based upon the three means of valid knowledge, an entity consisting in either of the three natures which is established through the reasoning of the proof of logical possibility is described as well established through reasoning.The well established reality has now been described.
uktaṃ prasiddhatattvaṃ //	The Reality of the Sphere of Purity.
{ viśuddhigocaratattvaṃ } tad anantaraṃ tu viśuddhiviṣayaṃ vaktavyam ityata āha viśuddhigocaratattvaṃ dvividham iti /	A twofold sphere of purity it is proclaimed as being due just to the one. It is due just to the perfected nature for the other natures do not belong to the sphere of the two pure direct intuitions. Since the domain of purity should be mentioned immediately following the latter, he says there is the twofold reality of the sphere of purity.
tattu yathā dvividhaṃ tat pradarśayann āha kleśāvaraṇaviśuddhijñānagocaraṃ jñeyāvaraṇaviśuddhijñānagocarañceti / kleśāvaraṇaviśuddhiḥ kleśāvaraṇaprahāṇaṃ /	Now, in order to demonstrate this twofold mode, he says the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable.The purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement is the relinquishment of obscuration that consists in moral defilement.
kleśāvaraṇaviśuddhaye kleśāvaraṇaviśuddhau vā jñānaṃ kleśāvaraṇaviśuddhijñānaṃ /	The term kleśăvaraṇaviśuddhijñāna may be interpreted either as a dative or locative tatpuruşa compound, i.e. the direct intuition leading to the purification of obscuration consisting in moral defilement, or in regard to the purification of obscuration consisting in moral defilement.
kleśāvaraṇaviśuddhiprayojanaṃ tan nimittaṃ vetyarthaḥ / tasya kleśāvaraṇaviśuddhijñānasya gocaram iti viṣaya ityarthaḥ /	The words the sphere of that direct intuition for the purification of obscuration consisting in moral defilement refer to direct intuition which has the purification of that for its object.
evaṃ jñeyāvaraṇaviśuddhijñānasya gocaram api vaktavyaṃ /	The sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable should also be described in this way.

jñātavyaṃ jñeyaṃ / tac ca sarvātmanā pañca vidyāsthānāni /	The knowable refers to that which is to be known and this, collectively, comprises the five branches of learning.
tāni punar adhyātmavyākaraṇahetucikitsāsarvaśilpakarmasthānākhyāni /	These are stated as the learning in regard to subjectivity, grammatical analysis, logic, medicine and all arts and crafts.
tatra jñānavibandhabhūtam akliṣṭam ajñānaṃ jñeyāvaraṇaṃ /	The obscuration that consists in the knowable refers to undefiled nescience which is an impediment to direct intuition in regard to these.
tad viśodhanaṃ lokottarajñānānulomādhimukticaryābhūmisangṛhītaṃ tat pṛṣṭhalabdhañca jñānaṃ /	The purification of that is the knowledge comprised in the spiritual level that is equivalent to the course of firm conviction which conforms with supramundane direct intuition and the knowledge comprised in the eleven spiritual levels beginning with the Joyous.
tat punar bodhisattvatathāgatasantānavartiṃ / tasya ca tathatā sarvatragādyarthamukhenālambanam ityato jñeyāvaraṇaviśuddhijñānagocarasya tattvaṃ tathatā /	Moreover, this purification refers to the knowledge that is attained subsequently to that knowledge in the eleven levels. This is present within the mental continuum of the bodhisattvas and tathāgatas, and, since its objective support is thusness because this has the sense of being allpervading etc.
phalahetutattvoktyā sūkṣmatattvoktyā ca viśūddhigocaraṃ dvividham api nirdiṣṭam eveti punar asya vidhānaṃ vyarthaṃ /	, the reality of the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable is equivalent to thusness.Objection Since the twofold sphere of purity has already been explained by way of the description of both the reality of the cause and result and the reality of the subtle, is it not so that their enumeration again here is unnecessary?
na vyarthaṃ / yatas tat phalahetutattvaṃ sūkṣmaṃ ca vastu vyavasthānata uktaṃ /	Response It is not unnecessary because the reality of the cause and result and of the subtle were formerly mentioned in order to define them as entities.
atra tvāvaraṇaṃ yathā viśuddhyate tathaitan nirdiṣṭaṃ /	However, in this context, it concerns the mode in which obscuration is purified, hence, this reality is explained.
idaṃ dvividhaṃ viśuddhigocaram ekasmāt pariniṣpannād eva svabhāvāt kīrtitaṃ /	This twofold sphere of purity is proclaimed as being due to just the one, i.e. it is due just to the perfected nature.
atraiva kāraṇam āha na hyanyaḥ svabhāvo viśuddhijñānagocaro bhavatīti /	Here now he provides the reason for the other natures do not belong to the sphere of the two pure direct intuitions.
kiṃ kāraṇaṃ ? abhūtaparikalpasya dauṣṭhulyamaladvayena samalabhūtatvāt parikalpitasya cāsattvāt /	What is the reason? Because unreal imagination which is equivalent to the otherdependent nature is stained on account of its possession of the two stains that comprise disquiet, and the imaginary nature does not exist.
dvividhajñānaviṣayasya tu dharmatāyā viśuddhiviṣayatattvaṃ pariniṣpannād eva vyavasthāpyata iti /	However, since real nature is the domain of the twofold direct intuition, the reality of the domain of purity is determined as being just due to the perfected nature.The reality of the sphere of purity has now been described.
uktaṃ viśuddhigocaratattvaṃ ////	There is the inclusion of the perfected nature.
{ sangrahatattvaṃ } tad anantaraṃ tu sangrahatattvaṃ vaktavyam ityataḥ pṛcchati kathaṃ trividhe mūlatattve sangrahatattvaṃ veditavyam iti /	However, since the inclusion reality is to be mentioned immediately following the latter, he asks how should the inclusion reality be understood in relation to the threefold basic reality?

dvaye paratantre parikalpite ca sangrahaḥ / tatra sangrahatattvaṃ pañca vastūnītyata āha yathāyogaṃ pañca vastūny ārabhyeti /	These are included within the two the otherdependent and the imaginary natures.Therein, the inclusion reality comprises five categories, hence he says from the point of view of the five categories, according to which is appropriate.
yathāyogaṃ mūlatattve pañca vastūni sangṛhītāni veditavyāni na tu yathākramaṃ /	Five categories should be understood as being included within basic reality, according to which is appropriate, but not according to sequential order.
sarvasya jñeyasyāsmin pañcavidhe vastuni sangrahād etat pañcavidhaṃ vastu saṃgrahatattvam ity ucyate /	These five categories are described as the inclusion reality because all that is knowable is included within these five categories.
tatra nimittam ālayavijñānaṃ kliṣṭamanaḥpravṛttivijñānāni ca /	In this respect, some believe that the causalsign refers to the storeconsciousness, defiled mind and the actual consciousnesses.
anyo'nyanimittabhāvān nimittaṃ /	It is described as the causalsign because it exists as a reciprocal cause.
nāma yat tasyaiva nimittasyā'nabhilāpyasyāpi sato'kṣinikocavad sūcakam abhidhānaṃ /	The name is an expression or indication of just that causalsign although it is inexpressible, like a gesture such as the winking of the eye.
yathoktanimittasvabhāvaviśeṣavikalpakāstraidhātukapratisaṃyuktāścittacaittā vikalpaḥ / śūnyatā tathatā /	Conceptual differentiation refers to mind and the mental concomitants associated with all the three realms of existence which consist in conceptual differentiation, as both ownbeing and particular, of the causalsign as has just been described.Thusness refers to emptiness.
samyag jñānaṃ lokottaraṃ tathatālambanaṃ /	Correct direct intuition consists in the supramundane and has thusness for its objective support.
kramaḥ punar eṣāṃ tatra sankleśaprajñaptivastutvān nimittam ādau / sankleśaprajñaptitvād anantaraṃ nāma / yathā nāma tathā sankleśaprajñaptivastuvikalpatvāt tad anantaraṃ vikalpaḥ / sa ca sankleśas tathatāsamyag jñānena nirudhyata iti tad anantaraṃ tathatā samyag jñānañceti kecit /	Now, as to their sequential order the causalsign comes first therein because it is the foundation for the designation as the defilement then comes the name because it is designated as the defilement then comes conceptual differentiation because as soon as it has a name, then conceptual differentiation occurs in regard to that entity designated as a defilement then comes thusness and correct direct intuition because that defilement is checked on account of thusness and correct direct intuition.
bhrāntinimittaṃ bhrāntidauṣṭhulyaṃ tan nimittam iti /	Others believe that the meaning of these five categories is evident in this verse Error is the cause of error, the cause of that is disquiet.
tasmād bhrāntis tasya nimittaṃ prakṛtiśamas tatra jñānaṃ //	Therefore, the cause of the latter is error. But knowledge in this regard is intrinsically tranquil.
tatrā'dhyātmikacakṣurādivijñānsaṃgṛhītāyā bhrānter nimittaṃ bāhyādhyātmikā rūpādicakṣurādisaṃgṛhītā bhrāntiḥ / tasyā bāhyādhyātimikāyā bhrānter nimittaṃ dauṣṭhulyaṃ / tat punar ālayavijñānavāsanā /	Therein, the cause of error, which is incorporated in the internal consciousnesses of sight etc., is external and internal error which are incorporated in form and the like and sight and the like.Furthermore, the cause of this external and internal error is disquiet and this is a latent impression of the storeconsciousness. The cause of this latent impression is none other than the external and internal error.
tasmāt tatrābhilāpapravṛttiḥ / abhilāpavaśāc ca vāsanāyā avasthānam ālayavijñāne /	As a consequence, verbal expression in regard to it manifests and it is due to verbal expression that the latent impression is lodged in the storeconsciousness.
prakṛtiśama iti tathatā / prakṛtyā kliṣṭatvād dharmadhātoḥ /	The term intrinsically tranquil refers to thusness because the dharmadhātu is intrinsically undefiled.
tatra nimittavikalpayoḥ paratantreṇa sangrahaḥ hetupratyayotpāditatvāt / nāmnaḥ parikalpiteneti /	Of these, there is the inclusion of the causalsign and conceptual differentiation by way of the otherdependent nature, because they are produced through causes and conditions, and of the name by way of the imaginary nature.
yathānāmārthābhāvān nāmnaḥ parikalpitena sangrahaḥ / evam adhikārasangrahaḥ parikalpitena nāmno na svabhāvasangrahaḥ iti yad uktaṃ niṣsvabhāvasiddhatvāt parikalpitaḥ svabhāvo nimittādipañcavastubhir na sangṛhīta iti tan na virudhyate tatra svabhāvasangrahasya vivakṣitatvāt /	The name is included by way of the imaginary nature because no object exists in keeping with its name thus, by connection, there is inclusion of name by way of the imaginary nature but its inclusion is not by way of ownbeing.And if it is said that the imaginary nature is not included in the five categories beginning with the causalsign because it is established as being devoid of ownbeing, such a statement is not contradicted because in that context there is the desire to state inclusion in terms of ownbeing.
samyag jñānasatattvasya iti / sadā śobhanaṃ vā tattvaṃ satattvaṃ tathatā śūnyatālambanādvayajñānaṃ tat pṛṣṭhalabdhaśuddhalaukikaṃ ca samyag jñānaṃ / tathatāsamyag jñānayor avikārā'viparyāsapariniṣpattyā yathākramaṃ pariniṣpannatvād ekenaiva pariniṣpannena svabhāvena sangraha iti /	Reality that is eternal or pure is true reality, i.e. thusness. Correct direct intuition refers to a the direct intuition that has emptiness for its objective support and is free from the duality and b the purified mundane knowledge that is attained subsequently to the latter, i.e. there is the inclusion of thusness and correct direct intuition by way of just the one, i.e. the perfected nature because it is perfected on account of its perfection that is respectively without change and is free from erroneous inversion.

yadyevaṃ katham avisāre'viparyāsa ityata āha tena bhāvābhāvayościttasyāvisaraṇād iti /	If this is so, how can there be an absence of erroneous inversion in relation to nondispersal? Hence he says because the nondispersal of mind toward existent or nonexistent entities is on account of it.

idānīṃ svalakṣaṇe'viparyāsapradarśanārtham āha sarvasya nāmamātratvaṃ sarvakalpāpravṛttaye /	Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual characteristic, he says V. The fact that everything is nameonly is for the nonengagement in all conceptual differentiation etc.

This is equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual characteristic. One engages in all conceptual differentiation in regard to all dharmas by way of imaginary dharmas.
ato nāmamātraprativedhajñānaṃ sarvavikalpapratipakṣaḥ svalakṣaṇe'viparyāsa ity uktaṃ /	Hence, the knowledge which penetrates the realization that all is nameonly and which is the counteragent to all conceptual differentiation, is described as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual characteristic.
tatra na jñāyate kiṃ paramārthe svalakṣaṇe āhosvit saṃvṛtāv ityataḥ pṛcchati katam asmin svalakṣaṇa iti / ata āha paramārthe svalakṣaṇe /	However, it is not known in this regard whether the latter refers to the individual characteristic in an ultimate sense or in a conventional sense, consequently he asks in Because the individual characteristic, in an ultimate sense, is inexpressible but not so in a conventional sense.What is the reason?

tasmād dharmadhātuḥ sarvadharmāṇāṃ sāmānyaṃ lakṣaṇam iti / sarvadharmeṣv apṛthaktvena tat sat sāmānyalakṣaṇam ucyate /	Therefore, the dharmadhātu is the universal characteristic of all dharmas it is described as the universal characteristic of all these existing dharmas as it is not different in all dharmas.Knowing that this is so is the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the universal characteristic i.

The characteristic in the ultimate sense lefers to the inexpressible essential nature which acts as the counteragent to the superimposed essential Furthermore, the universal characteristic refers to the insubstantial imaginary nature which is innate to all dharmas.

tatra viparyasta manaskāra ālayavijñānahetur viparyayavikalpaḥ /	In this respect, erroneously inverted mental activity is conceptual differentiation that consists in erroneous inversion and is the ground of the storeconsciousness.
tasyāprahāṇaṃ dharmadhātor aviśuddhiḥ prahāṇaṃ viśuddhiḥ /	The lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the nonrelinquishment of the latter purity on its behalf refers to its relinquishment.

viparyasta manaskārāprahāṇaṃ tasya dharmadhātor aviśuddhir iti dharmadhātor aviśuddhāvaviparyāsaḥ /	The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the fact that the nonrelinquishment of erroneously inverted mental activity is equivalent to the lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhātu.
tasya prahāṇaṃ viśuddhir iti viśuddhāv aviparyāsaḥ /	The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to its purity refers to the fact that its relinquishment is equivalent to purity on its behalf.What is the reason?
kiṃ kāraṇaṃ ? dharmadhātor āgantukenopakleśenopakliṣṭatvāt /	Because the dharmadhatu is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement.
ayam api saṃvṛttyaivāviparyāso na paramārthataḥ / anena cāviparyāsena bodhisattvo'prahīṇāvaraṇaṃ dharmadhātoḥ prahāṇañca prajānāti /	This too is an absence of erroneous inversion only in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense and, through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva clearly comprehends the obscuration to the dharmadhātu that has not been relinquished and that which has been relinquished.

For, the dharmadhitu is pure by nature, like space etc. Moreover, because the dharmadhatu is pure by nature, like space, this pair, i.
paścāc ca pratipakṣodayena tat prahāṇād viśuddhiḥ /	its lack of purity and subsequent purity, is adventitious.

This fault is not since, in this context, this purity is intended as an absence of stain only because of this is it stated that its purity is subsequent.Knowing that this is so in regard to the dharmadhātu is equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the adventitious nature of both the lack of purity and the purity on the part of the dharmadhātu.
ayam api saṃvṛttyā na tu paramārthataḥ /	This too is an absence of erroneous inversion in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense.
anena cāviparyāsena bodhisattvo dharmadhātoḥ sankleśavyavadānāvasthayoḥ kṛtrimatvaṃ prajānātīti //	Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva clearly comprehends the fabricated nature of the states of defilement and purification in regard to the dharmadhātu.

na hi pudgalasya sankleśo na viśuddhiḥ nāpi dharmasya / sankleśo viśuddhirśceti vartate / atraiva kāraṇam āha yasmān na pudgalo'sti na dharmaḥ /	Defilement and purity do not belong to the dharmas nor to the personal entity etc. There is no defilement nor purity on the part of the personal entity nor the dharmas the words defilement and purity remain in force in regard to the latter i.

dharmo'pi parikalpitātmako naivāsti ekasminn vastuny ekaparikalpapravṛtteḥ /	However, there is no personal entity such as that because it is not an object of direct perception or inference. Also, the dharmas which possess an imaginary nature are certainly nonexistent.

kiṃ kāraṇaṃ ? tasya nirabhilāpyādvayaprakṛtitvāt /	For what reason? Because it is inexpressible and nondual by nature.
yadi paratantrasyāpi neṣyate kasya te syātāṃ ? tasminn asati sankleśaparihāre vyavadānaprāptiyatnavaiyarthyaṃ /	If defilement and purity are not even accepted as belonging to the otherdependent nature, to which nature would they belong for the effort directed towards the relinquishment of defilement and the acquisition of purity would be in vain if they, i.e. defilement and purity, did not exist?

This is equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and the lack of arrogance.
anye tvāhuḥ na sankleśapakṣe kasyacid hānir na vyavadānapakṣe viśeṣo'sti tad ubhayavataḥ kasyacid abhāvāt /	However, others say that in regard to the side of defilement, there is no deficiency on the part of anyone and in regard to the side of purification, there is no excellence because there is no one who possesses both of these.
yataḥ punas ta evaṃ bhavatas tatra kim iti trāso bhavaty ayaṃ me nāstīti kim iti māno bhavaty ayaṃ me viśeṣa iti /	Since the two do not exist in this way, how, in this respect, can one either fear that this is not mine, or have the prideful notion that this excellence belongs to me?
apare tu manyate pudgalas tāvan naivāsti / dharmo'pi naivāsti / avasthādvayaṃ yo'nubhavati yasyaitad dvayaṃ kalpyeta /	Others again believe that in the first place the personal entity does not exist and a dharma which experiences the two states and to which the two are imagined to belong also does not exist.
kiṃ tarhi pratītyasamutpādamātram etat sankleśavyavadānam iti / ayam api saṃvṛttyā na tu paramārthataḥ tasya nirvikalpakatvāt /	On the contrary, this defilement and purification is none other than dependent origination.This apparent quote from the Bhaşya is quite different to the corresponding passage from the Sanskrit Bhasya which echoes the view expressed by Sthiramati in paragraph below.
anena cāviparyāsena kṣayavṛddhyasadbhāvād avikāritvaṃ dharmadhātoḥ pratividhyatīti /	V the latter is devoid of conceptual differentiation. Through this absence of erroneous inversion, penetrates the unchanging nature of the dharmadhātu because of the absence of decay and growth.
anena cāviparyāsena sarvam āvaraṇaṃ prahāya nirāvaraṇo niryātītyanye /	Others believe that goes forth free from obscuration after having relinquished all obscuration through this absence of erroneous inversion.
atha vānena saṃvṛtyātmakena daśaviparyāsena paramārthāviparyāso'tra sūcitaḥ tasyānyathā nirdeśānupapatteḥ /	Alternatively, the absence of erroneous inversion in an absolute sense is indicated here by way of the tenfold absences of erroneous inversion which consist in the conventional, since it is not possible to explain it in any other way.

atattvaviṣayatve'pi satyevaṃ tad dvayam aviparyāsa eva / aviparyāsas tathaiveti /	Although they do not have a reality for their object, these two do consist in an absence of erroneous inversion since they are without erroneous inversion as such in this way.
manaskāre'viparyāsaḥ paratantrasvabhāvam adhikṛtya / jalpamanaskārasya prakṛtyā ālayavijñānātmakatvāt /	The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity refers to the otherdependent nature because the mental activity that consists in talk is intrinsic to the nature of the storeconsciousness.
avisāre'viparyāsaḥ pariniṣpannasvabhāvam adhikṛtya /	The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to nondispersal refers to the perfected nature.
kuta etan nirvikalpasya jñānasya bhāvābhāvayor vikṣepavigatatvād aviparyāsapariniṣpattyā ca pariniṣpannasvabhāvasaṃgṛhītatvāt /	Why? Because direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differentiation is not distracted by conjecture about existent or nonexistent entities and the latter is incorporated in the perfected nature since it is perfection as an absence of erroneous inversion.

The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to what is adventitious refers to that same dharmadhātu for it is due to the mental defilement and the mental purity of that which, like space, is pure by nature that the two are respectively determined as adventitious.
evam ete daśa viparyāsāḥ svabhāvatraye veditavyāḥ /	These tenfold absences of erroneous inversion are to be understood in this way in relation to the three natures.

tatra vajramiva vajraṃ sarvaviparyāsabheditvāt taiścābhedyatvāt /	One refutes this through their resemblance to a magical creation, i.e. on the grounds that what comprises a magical creation does not exist yet it is perceived.

athava durbhedatayā vajravadetānyeva padāni vajra padānītyuccayante /	Consequently, words of the vajra means objective supports of the vajra alternatively, these words are described as vajra words because, like a vajra, they are difficult to split.
atrāviparyāsānāṃ sūtrayojanārthaṃ vajrapadopanyāsaḥ /	The vajra words are specifically mentioned in this context because the absences of erroneous inversion must be connected with the Sutras.

dvayaprabhāsaḥ parikalpitaḥ sa cātrārthaḥ / sa ca tathā na vidyata ityayam atrāviparyāsa ityarthāviparyāso vajrapadeṣv aviparyāse yojayitavyaḥ /	The appearance as the duality which is imaginary refers to the object in this context and the knowledge that it is nonexistent as such refers to the absence of erroneous inversion in this regard. Thus, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the object is to be connected with the absence of erroneous inversion listed among the vajra words.
jalpamanaskāra evātrāśraya ityato manaskāre'viparyāso vajrapadeṣvāśraye yojayitavyaḥ /	Since that same mental activity that consists in talk is a basis in this context, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity is to be connected with the basis listed among the vajra words.

dharmadhātoḥ sankleśavyavadānayor āgantukatve'viparyāso'sāvapyākāśopamatāyāṃ yojayitavyaḥ /	Moreover, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the adventitious nature of defilement and purification on the part of the dharmadhātu is to be connected with the resemblance to space.

tatra trayaḥ svabhāvāḥ pariniṣpannaparikalpitaparatantrākhyā ādyais tribhiḥ padair yathākramam iti /	Of these, the three natures called perfected, imaginary and otherdependent correspond respectively with the first three words. Therein, the first are existence and nonexistence, the absence of erroneous inversion and the basis.
tatra sadasattayā pariniṣpanna uktaḥ / aviparyāsena parikalpita uktaḥ / āśrayatvena paratantra uktaḥ /	Of these, by existence and nonexistence, the perfected is referred to by the absence of erroneous inversion, the imaginary is referred to by the basis, the otherdependent is referred to.

Certain people believe that the perfected is explained as both existent and nonexistent because it both exists and does not exist.How can it be due to the fact that the perfected nature has the characteristic of both existence and nonexistence?

atas tat sadasattā pariniṣpannaḥ svabhāva ity uktam ityanye /	Hence, this vajra word existence and nonexistence is said to refer to the perfected nature.

aviparyāsena parikalpitas tasyāvidyamānena dvayarūpeṇa prakhyāti lakṣaṇāt /	The imaginary is described as being without erroneous inversion because it is characterized by manifesting in the nature of the duality which does not exist.

Since there are different ways of resolving this compound in this context, he says that on account of which one does not conceptually differentiate, i.
tatrārya vigrahabhedaḥ na vikalpayatyanenetyavikalpanaṃ na vikalpyate tadityavikalpanaṃ /	direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation and that which does not perform conceptual differentiation in regard to intrinsic luminosity.These are the different ways of resolving the compound avikalpanatā a there is an absence of conceptual differentiation avikalpana since, on account of this, one does not conceptually differentiate and b there is an absence of conceptual differentiation avikalpana since it is not conceptually differentiated.

tatra codyaṃ yadyete parikalpitaparatantralakṣaṇā dharmā na saṃvidyante grāhyagrāhakatveneti vākyaśeṣaḥ /	This is the objection in this regard If these dharmas which are characterized by the imaginary and otherdependent natures are nonexistent.

tanmāyopamatayā pariharati /	One refutes this through their resemblance to a magical creation, i.e.
yathā māyākṛtaṃ na saṃvidyata upalabhyate ceti / na hi māyopalabhyatayā saṃvidyate tato'pyevaṃ saṃvidyata iti jñātuṃ śakyate /	on the grounds that what comprises a magical creation does not exist yet it is perceived. For a magical creation exists as a perception consequently, its existence as such cannot be known.

On ekašeşa, see L, Renou Terminologie Grammaticale du Sanskrit. I am indebted to Johannes Bronkhorst of the Instituut Kern, Leiden for his assistance in arriving at this interpretation. Thus, although it is pure by nature, the defilement on the part of the dharmadhātu is on account of adventitious secondary defilement and purification is due to the removal of the latter. An objection If there is the removal of the moral defilement of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings when immeasurable numbers of Buddhas are born, how is that, although the Buddhas are born individually in beginningless samsåra, samsara is not eradicated and nirvapa is not augmented due to the removal of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings from samsāra and their entry to nirvāṇa? Its refutation is on the grounds of nondeficiency and nonexcellence, because the realms of sentient beings and sides to purification are immeasurable.For, the diminution or eradication of something which possesses limitations can be conceived but the realm of sentient beings is immeasurable and its diminution cannot be conceived, how much less can its eradication, like that of space, possibly be conceived?
vyavadānasyāpyaprameyatvād viśeṣa eva nāsti tasya kathaṃ vṛddhir bhaviṣyati ākāśavat / tasyāvaraṇāpagād āvaraṇābhāvāc ceti /	Since there is indeed no excellence of purification too because of its immeasurable nature, how can there be augmentation on its part, like with space, because both the removal of obscuration and the arising of obscuration belong to it?
dvitīyaṃ śarīravyavasthānam iti vajrapadānām ity adhikṛtaṃ / yatra yā ca yato bhrāntir abhrāntir yā ca yatra ca /	Secondly, the body is established as follows, i.e. with reference to the vajra words a Wherein, whatever and whence is error and b wherein and whatever is nonerror and indeed c the results of both error and nonerror and d the end of these two.

yato bhrāntir ityāśrayād bhrāntir āśrayaḥ punar jalpaparibhāvito manaskāra ālayavijñānātmakaḥ /	Whence is error refers to the fact that error comes from a basis this basis is the mental activity that is developed by talk and which consists in the storeconsciousness.
abhrāntir yā ceti māyādivad arthataḥ sadasattāvisāro'bhrāntiḥ /	And whatever is nonerror refers to the absence of error, i.e. nondispersal towards the existence or nonexistence of the object which is like a magical creation etc.

bhrāntyabhrāntiphale caiveti tatra bhrāntiphalaṃ hi sankleśaḥ /	And indeed the results of error and nonerror in this regard, defilement is the result of error the ellipsis is i. e. the natural outcome of error.
abhrāntiniṣyandānāyā bhrānter abhrāntiphalatvāt / abhrāntiphalaṃ vyavadānaṃ sasamprayogam iti vākyaśeṣaḥ /	Since the absence of error consists in the natural outcome of the absence of error, the result of the absence of error is purification because it is the result of the absence of error the ellipsis is together with its associates.
evakārakaraṇaṃ tat phale sankleśo vyavadānam ityanenaivokte ākāśopamatayā tu paśyati dharmadhātor yasya bhrāntyabhrāntiphalaṃ tat sankleśavyavadānātmakaṃ / nedaṃ tat prakṛtikam iti pradarśanārthaṃ /	The use of the particle indeed refers to these two results described by defilement and purification however, in order to demonstrate that through the resemblance to space, the results of both error and the absence of error on the part of the dharmadhātu is seen to have the nature of defilement and purification, but they are not intrinsic to it.
paryantaś ca tayor iti sankleśavyavadānayoḥ paryanto nirvāṇaṃ / taccahīnānadhikatvena paryantam uktam ityeke / anye tvāhuḥ saṃsārasyāprameyatayā'pacayābhāvād ahīnatāyuktaḥ sankleśaparyantaḥ / nirvāṇasyāprameyatayopacayābhāvād aviśiṣṭatāyukto vyavadānaparyanta iti / etāni daśa vajrapadāny aviparyāsaprasangadvāreṇoktāni /	And the end of these two some people believe that this refers to the end of both defilement and purification, i. e. nirvāṇa moreover, the latter is described as the end insofar as it is without deficiency and excellence.However, others believe that the end of defilement is the possession of nondeficiency because defilement does not accumulate due to the immeasurable nature of samsära and the end of purification is the possession of nonexcellence because purification does not increase due to the immeasurable nature of nirvāṇa. In this context, the view that the connection between a word and its object belongs to the perfected is erroneous inversion. The view that objects exist by way of essential nature in exactly that way in which they appear is erroneous inversion. The view that incorporates the cause for the arising of the object is erroneous inversion, The views that incorporate imputation or negation in regard to the object are erroneous inversion. The view that the ownbeing of the object is in accord with its nominal designation is erroneous inversion. The views that regard the individual or universal characteristics of entities as substantially existent are erroneous inversion.The view that the purity or the lack of purity of actions is due to auspicious or inauspicious behaviour is erroneous inversion.
ekasyaivāśuddhiviśuddhidarśanaṃ viparyāsaḥ /	The view that both the lack of purity and purity belong to one and the same is erroneous inversion.

ityete daśa viparyāsāḥ / bodhisattvasya tad abhāvādaviparyāsāvasthitasya yathokteṣvartheṣvariṇatā vidarśanā bhāvanā veditavyā /	These are the ten erroneous inversions because they are nonexistent on the part of the bodhisattva, which becomes free from erroneous inversion in relation to the categories as described should be known as the meditative development of penetrating insight.

Which is the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes? That which is taught as the middle way in the Ratnakūţa.This is to be known as being due to the avoidance of which extremes? The extremes concerning separateness and identity, those of the tirthika and śravaka, the twofold extremes of imputation and negation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas.
katamaśca yoniśodharmaprayogaḥ ? yaduta sarvadharmāṇāṃ bhūtapratyavekṣā /	The notion that mind is real is the extreme of imputation in regard to the dharmas the notion that it is not real is the extreme of negation.
yā nātmapratyavekṣā na sattvanajīvanapoṣanapudgalanamanujanamānavapratyavekṣā /	The notion that nescience consists in the apprehended object and apprehending subject is one extreme likewise the notion that knowledge, the formative forces and the unconditioned which is the counteragent to the latter, up until oldage and death, consist in the apprehended object and apprehending subject is another extreme.
iyam ucyate kāśyapa madhyamā pratipaditi vistareṇa yāvad dvitīyapradīpodāharaṇaparyantaḥ paṭhyate /	Thus, the extremes in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject are twofold according to their differentiation as belonging to the black or the white side. The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these. i.e.
kasyāntasya varjanādasau veditavyā ? katam asyāntasya varjanān madhyamā pratipatter jñātavyetyarthaḥ /	in detail, both knowledge and nescience are nondual because of the absence of the apprehended object and the apprehending subject on the part of knowledge and nescience etc.
ata āha pṛthaktvaikatvam antaś ca tīrthyaśrāvakayor api //	Conceptual differentiation in regard to correctness is one extreme and in regard to falsity is another extreme.
iti vistaraḥ /	Hence he says V.
ayaṃ pañcadaśavidho'ntadvayabhedaḥ / asya varjanāt sā veditavyā /	These fifteen types are differentiated into two extremes this is to be known as being due to the avoidance of these.
atra pṛthagādidarśanamantaḥ / ekaikapakṣābhiniviṣṭatvāt kārye kāraṇopacāraṃ kṛtvā /	In this regard, the views concerning separateness etc. are extremes considering that there is the figurative use of a cause in regard to the effect because one becomes notionally attached each to his own view.
tatra rūpādibhyaḥ pṛthaktvam ātmana ityantaḥ ekatvam ityantaḥ /	Of these, the notion that the self is something separate from form etc. is one extreme the notion that it is identical is another extreme.

There is one view, expressed in a Sūtra, that holds the individual soul to be identical with the physical body and another view that holds the individual soul to be one entity and the physical body another. These are described by the word extreme in this context.
tat parivarjanārtham iti rūpādibhyas tattvānyatvāntaparivarjanārtham ātmanaḥ / madhyamā pratipad yad dharmātraṃ viṣayabhūtaṃ jñānaṃ /	For the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. for the purpose of avoiding the extremes of identity and difference of the self in relation to form etc., there is the middle way, i.e. direct intuition that has for its object only the dharmas.
etad eva pradarśayann āha yā nātmapratyavekṣā yāvannamānapratyavekṣeti /dharmamātradarśanāddhi vandhyāpurtravad ātmā nāstītyavagacchan nātmānaṃ pratyavekṣate nānusaratītyarthaḥ / kuta eva tasya rūpādibhyas tattvam anyatvaṃ vā gṛhyata iti ? ātmaśabdenaiva tadarthe'vagamyamāne kimarthaṃ sattvādiparyāyaviśeṣābhidhānaṃ ? na sarvasya sarvaparyāyavyutpattir ityataḥ sarveṣāṃ tadarthāvabodhārthaṃ paryāyāntaranirdeśaḥ /	In order to demonstrate this, he says i.e. that which does not investigate a self, concluding with the noninvestigation of a human being.What is the reason that its identity or difference is perceived in relation to form etc. and why is the self mentioned by special synonyms, such as sentient being when it is understood in that sense just by the word self? Since all people do not understand all synonyms, it is explained through another synonym in order that everyone can understand its meaning.
tat kālavikṣiptānāṃ vā paryāyāntareṇa tadarthaprāpaṇārthaḥ / tenaivābhidhānenocyamāne'nyeṣāṃ prāpaṇāt /	Alternatively, it is for the purpose of conveying its meaning through different synonyms to those who were distracted at a particular time because when it is mentioned through that description, it is conveyed to others.
nityaṃ rūpam iti tīrthikāntaḥ /	The notion that form is permanent is an extreme embraced by the tirthikas.
te hi parikalpitarūpān vastutvenābhiniveśya nityatvena kalpayanti nityaviparyāsopahatatvāt /	For, having become attached to imaginary form as an entity, they construe it to be permanent because they are misled through erroneously inverting it as permanent.
anityam iti śrāvakāntaḥ /	The notion that it is impermanent is an extreme embraced by the śrävakas.
tair api kalpitasvabhāvānāṃ rūpādīnāṃ vasturūpeṇānityatvena samāropaṇādantatvaṃ /	This is an extreme because they impute a substantial although impermanent nature upon form etc.Whose essential nature is imaginary.

For the purpose of avoiding both of these, i. e. for the purpose of avoiding the views of form as permanent or impermanent, there is the middle way, i.
tat punaḥ kiṃ /	Just what is this middle way?
nirvikalpajñānaṃ /	It is direct intuition free from conceptual differentiation, i.
yan na rūpādīn rūpādiṣv eva nityatvenānityatvena cānugacchati /	that which does not understand form etc. just in relation to entities of form etc. or as permanent or impermanent.

nairātmyam ityapavādāntaḥ /	For, negation is described as imagining that something existent is nonexistent.
ātmanastv asattvāt kathaṃ nairātmyam ity apavādānta āpadyata ityata āha prajñaptisato'pyapavādāt nairātmyam apavādānta iti sambadhyate /	But if the self does not exist, how can its description as insubstantial be an extreme of negation? For, there is the negation of just that which exists as a designation. It is an extreme which negates the existence as something insubstantial that is referred to.
sa punar dharmāṇāṃ santāno yasmin hetuphalasambandhaḥ prajñāyate /	Moreover, it is a continuum of dharmas wherein the close connection of cause and result is evident.

nirvikalpaṃ jñānaṃ / grāhyārthavikalpasyāntatvaṃ darśayitvā grāhakārthavikalpasyāntatvapradarśanārtham āha bhūtaṃ cittam ityādi /	Direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.Having shown that conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is an extreme and in order to demonstrate that conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehending subject is also an extreme, he says the notion that mind is real etc.
athavā pudgalasya samāropāpavādāntatvaṃ darśayitvā dharmasya samāropāpavādāntadarśanārtham āha bhūtaṃ cittam ityādi /	Alternatively, after showing that imputation and negation in regard to the personal entity is an extreme and in order to show the extremes of imputation and negation in regard to the dharmas, he says the notion that mind is real etc.
yathā pratibhāsate yathā vā'bhilapyate cittaṃ tathaiva bhūtaṃ vidyata iti /ayaṃ dharmasamāropāntaḥ abhūtasya cittasvabhāvabhūtatvena samāropāt /	The notion that mind exists as a reality in exactly that way in which it appears, or, as it is expressed. This is the extreme of imputation in regard to the dharmas, because the ownbeing of mind which is without reality, is imputed as real.
abhūtaṃ cittam ityapavādāntaḥ /	The notion that mind is not real is the extreme of negation.
tasya hi grāhyagrāhakarahitātmanā nirabhilāpyena ca vidyamānam apyabhūtam iti paśyataḥ sarvātmanā dharmasvabhāvāpavādād apavādāntaḥ / tat parivarjanārtham iti samāropāpavādarahitasya dharmanairātmyasya pravitedhārthaṃ madhyamā pratipad / sā yatra nacittaṃ na cetanā na mano na vijñānam iti /	The view which regards mind as unreal although existent in a nature devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending subject and inexpressible is an extreme of negation because it completely negates the ownbeing of the dharmas.For the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. for the purpose of penetrating the insubstantiality of the dharmas which is devoid of imputation and negation, there is the middle way, i.e. Alternatively, that sphere within which mind does not arise in its nature as a collection of latent impressions accompanied by impurity, nor does volition characterized by formative influence, nor does thought in the aspect of selfconceit , nor does consciousness as conceptual differentiation this is described as the middle way.
tatra cittam ālayavijñānaṃ sarvasrāvadharmavāsanābhiścittatvāt /	Therein, mind refers to the storeconsciousness since it is the collection of latent impressions of all dharmas accompanied by impurity.
cetanā manaskarma kuśalākuśalāvyākṛteṣu cittapreraṇakarmikā /	Volition refers to the actions of mind and consists in the actions that stimulate mind toward the wholesome, the unwholesome and the neutral.

akuśalādayo dharmāḥ saṃkleśa iti vipakṣāntaḥ / kuśalādayo vyavadānam iti pratipakṣāntaḥ /	The notion that the dharmas, such as those that are unwholesome, are defilement is an extreme in regard to adverse elements the notion that the wholesome ones etc.Are equivalent to purification is an extreme in regard to the counteragent.
ādiśabdena sāvadyaanavadyalaukikalokottarasāsravānāsravasaṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtādayo nirdeśāḥ sambadhyante /	By the word etc., the explanations of dharmas are referred to that are reprehensible, not reprehensible, mundane, supramundane, with and without impurity, conditioned and unconditioned etc.
tatra yathaivākuśalāḥ kuśalāś ca dharmāḥ pratibhāsante'bhilapyante ca tathaiva saṃkleśo vyavadānañceti darśanaṃ vipakṣāntaḥ pratipakṣāntaś ca /	In this respect, the extreme in regard to adverse elements and the extreme in regard to the counteragent refers to the notion that defilement and purification are exactly equivalent to the mode in which the unwholesome and wholesome dharmas appear and are articulated.
tatrā'kuśalā akṣemārthatvāt / sāvadyā duścaritasamutthāpakatvāt / laukikā viparyastatvāt / sāsravā āsravānuśayitatvāt / saṃskṛtāḥ pratyayotpāditvāt /	Therein the dharmas are unwholesome because they have the sense of discomfort they are reprehensible because they cause the manifestation of bad conduct they are mundane because they are erroneously inverted they are accompanied by impurity because they have a propensity towards impurity they are conditioned because they are produced from causal conditions.
tad viparītās tu kuśalādayo veditavyāḥ /	However, the wholesome ones etc. should be known as the inverse of these.

ubhayāntavigamo'tra madhyamabhipretamityeke /	Some believe that the mean in this context is intended as being separate from both extremes.
ubhaya lakṣanamatra dvayorantayo madhyamityapare /	Others maintain that the mean here lies between these two extremes and has the characteristic of both.

The extreme of eternalism refers to the notional attachment to the view that an entity that is an object both of knowledge and verbal description, like the imagination of what is unreal or the dharmadhātu, exists substantially and in an ultimate sense because these do not exist as such.
tadvā śaśaviṣāṇavan nāstyeveti darśanam ucchedāntaḥ /	Similarly, the view that definitely does not exist, like the horns of a hare, is the extreme of annihilationism.

atra ca yāvaj jarāmaraṇam iti paryantagrahāṇād vijñānanāmarūpādayo'dhyākṣipyante /	Moreover, because of the reference here to the final member of the twelve nidäna by the words up until oldage and death, consciousness and name/form etc. are also included.

Knowledge refers to direct intuition devoid of impurity. The counteragent to the formative forces refers just to direct intuition that is unconditioned it is only hence and in order to distinguish it from other unconditioned elements that he says the counteragent to the latter. However, others consider that in this respect the unconditioned is also eightfold because of the fact that it possesses nonorigination but the counteragent refers to volition that is without impurity because it does not formatively influence the new existence. Alternatively, the notion that the cessation of these consists in the apprehended object and apprehending subject is an extreme. By the word these, the nidänal beginning with consciousness and concluding with oldage and death, are referred to. Since it is not known whether sensation is an entity or a cause, he says it, i. e. name/form, is checked by that. By what is name/form checked? By the path which is without impurity and which is the counteragent to name/form.Knowledge and nescience which are nondual do not make a duality, thus, in this context the path is comprised only by direct intuition together with its associated elements.
kena punas tan nāmarūpaṃ nirudhyate / nāmarūpapratipakṣeṇā'nāsraveṇa mārgeṇa /	Consequently, since name/form is checked by this, there is cessation but what is the extreme here? Just the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject.
kiṃ kāraṇaṃ ? advayaprakṛtiṣv avidyādiṣv avidyamānadvayādhyāropapravṛttavāt /	What is the reason? Because the imposition of a nonexisting duality occurs in regard to nescience etc. which are nondual by nature.
evaṃ grāhyagrāhakānto dvidhā kṛṣṇaśuklapakṣabhedeneti /	Thus, the extremes in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject are twofold according to their differentiation as belonging to the black or the white side.

From the cessation of ignorance up until the cessation of oldage and death.
atra ca nirydhyante'enā'vidyādaya iti tat pratipakṣabhūto mārga eva nirodhaśabdenoktaḥ /	Moreover, in this context, it is just the path that is the counteragent to these that is signified by the word cessation since ignorance etc.Is checked on account of it.

kathaṃ vidyā cāvidyā ca yāvaj jarāmaraṇaṃ tan nirodhaścā'dvayam ityata āha vidyāvidyādīnāṃ grāhyagrāhakatvābhāvād iti /	How can knowledge and nescience, up until oldage and death and the cessation of the latter, be nondual? Hence he says because of the absence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject on the part of knowledge and nescience etc.
tad abhāvastv avidyādīnām advayaprakṛtitvāt /	However, that absence is because of the fact that nescience etc. is nondual by nature.
athavā vidyā'vidyeti parikalpitasvabhāvo'taś ca parikalpitasvabhāvayor vidyā'vidyayorabhāvasamatayā vidyā cā'vidyā cādvayam iti /	Alternatively, since both knowledge and nescience have an imaginary nature, knowledge and nescience are nondual since the nonexistence of both knowledge and nescience, which have an imaginary nature, is the same.

etad eva jñānaṃ vidyā cāvidyā cādvayam etadavaidhīkāram iti na vidyotpādayitavyā nā'vidyā nirodhayitavyā / na saṃskārādayaḥ praheyāḥ /	Just this knowledge that, since knowledge and nescience are nondual and do not make a duality, the knowledge to be generated is nonexistent and the nescience to be checked is nonexistent, the formative forces to be relinquished are nonexistent and the cessation of the latter which is to be attained is nonexistent.
na tannirodhaḥ prāptavya iti yadevaṃ jñānam etadavaidhīkāraṃ // trividhaḥ sankleśa iti /	The knowledge that this is so is the nonmaking of duality. Defilement is threefold.

Because they are emptiness etc. by their very nature. What is meant is they are devoid of the ownbeing of false view etc. by their very nature. As to why this is so, he says because the dharmadhātu is undefiled by nature. Hence, since the dharmas that are the object of emptiness knowledge etc. are emptiness etc. by their very nature, they are not caused to be empty etc. through emptiness knowledge etc. Thus, the object of signless knowledge which is devoid of the sign of passion etc. is not caused to be signless through signless knowledge because the emptiness of the sign of passion etc.Is, in itself, signless.

Hence he says these are due to imagining that emptiness is for the destruction of the belief in the existence of the personal entity, or else, insubstantiality is nonexistent.
yadi śūnyatayā dharmān prakṛtiśūnyatvān na śūnyān karoti tena tarhi pudgalo'sti yasya vināśāya śūnyatā /	If does not cause the dharmas to be empty through emptiness because they are empty by nature, then in that case, emptiness is for the destruction of From KP.

evañca kṛtvā pudgaladharmātmanā na bhāvaḥ śūunyatā tad rahitatvāt /	After considering it in this way, the emptiness of the personal entity and the dharmas by way of substantiality is not an ens because it is devoid of the latter nor is it a nonens since it consists in the perfected.

śāmye'pi vikalpo'ntaḥ śamane'pi vikalpo'nta ityanuvartate /	Do not rely on the personal entity, because it is just a verbal expression.
katham ityata āha praheyaprahāṇakalpanayā śūnyatāyās trasanāditi /	How so? Hence he says these are on account of imaginative constructions in regard to the object of relinquishment and the act of relinquishing which are due to the fear of emptiness.

Moreover, just as the painter, having, through false conceptual differentiation, superimposed the existence of a real yakṣa upon the terrifying figure of the yakşa that he himself has created, and fearing it, is rendered unconscious, similarly, all ordinary people who are impelled by false conceptual differentiation wander in samsāra on account of their individual conceptual differentiations which are described as their own creations and are in a momentary state because they are not established in homogeneous groups. The former example is in relation to the śrävaka but the. The latter is in relation to the bodhisattva. Some believe that the śrävaka is afraid of emptiness because he has not gained mastery over emptiness however, the bodhisattva is defiled by conceptual differentiation in regard to the imaginary dharmas because moral defilement consists in conceptual differentiation.Others believe there is no meaningful distinction between the two, nevertheless, they are verbally expressed as a pair on account of the influence of the two categories.

Hence he says if one imagines that the counteragent does not arise. The extreme that consists in conceptual differentiation in regard to nonorigination refers to the notion that insofar as the counteragent has not arisen for a period of time in the past, so too will it not arise in the present.
