(2) From the presence of sun-light, the presence of shade on the other side is inferred 3) When the half-burnt wood-piece is seen in the dark from a distance, it brings up the idea of smoke

trirūpa hetu nirdeśa sāmarthyāt eva siddhitaḥ  | na viparyaya śaṅkā asti vyartham nigamanam tatas || 	As a matter of fact, the proving is accomplished by the force of the statement of the three-featured probans; consequently, there can be no suspicion regarding the contrary conclusion; hence the statement of the final conclusion is useless

It is this that has been described by Vindhyavāsin as inference based upon the perceived relationship of particulars”.—[Ślokavārtika—inference, 141-143] 1443-1445) “Though the inference based upon generalised relationship could be exemplified on the basis of another fire and another smoke,—yet the inference cited is that of the ‘sun moving’, as this is based absolutely upon generalised relationship”—[Ślokavārtika.—inference, 145]

na ca nirviṣayam jñānam yuṣmābhiḥ anumanyate | vikalpita artha tāyām ca vyaktam nirviṣayam bhavet || 	A cognition devoid of objects is not admitted by you; and if the inference had an assumed object, it would clearly be devoid of an object

What is the peculiarity in the previous one (whereby it is regarded as valid, and not the later one)?—If it be urged that—“the later one is not regarded as valid because like remembrance, it apprehends what has been already apprehended”,—then why is not the previous inference also regarded as the same?—If it be argued that—“in the former inference there is this additional peculiarity that it sets aside the doubt that has set in during the interval,”—why is not the same in the latter also? Hence it is this latter itself that sets aside the doubt as to something being present or not present; and hence the generalised perception is really what is independent 
na pramāṇam iti prāhuḥ anumānam tu kecana | vivakṣām arpayantaḥ api vāgbhiḥ ābhiḥ kudṛṣṭayaḥ || 	Some short-sighted people have asserted that “inference is not a means of right cognition”, though, by these very words, they offer up their own ‘desire to speak’ (intention, idea in the mind, as something to be inferred from those words)

Because no such inference could be possible except through essential sameness or being the cause. Mutually contradictory properties cannot belong to the same thing. Consequently there can be no possibility of any pbobans which might be concomitant with the contrary of the desired conclusion

Indeed no disputant ever comprehends what you wish to speak of

So that when the ordinary (popular) idea is accepted, what is it that becomes excluded?

Further, the lamp, which is illuminative by its very nature, does not need a convention (in illumining things). Lastly, as there is another convention also (bearing upon the same word), there could be no comprehension of that other thing from that same word. Even though there be a convention, the lamp cannot manifest odour, taste, etc.—Nor can any such potency (of words) be recognised

āpta anaṅgīkṛteḥ eva dvitīyam api na kṣamam | śābda lakṣaṇam iṣṭau vā saḥ ayam iti aviniścitaḥ || 	Because the ‘trustworthy person’ is not admitted, therefore the second definition also of verbal cognition is not proper.—Even if such a person were regarded as possible, that a certain person is such a one cannot be ascertained

teṣām api vivakṣāyāḥ kevalāyāḥ virudhyate | na anumā ekānta sadbhāvāt prāṇita ādi prasiddhaye || 	In the case of those words also, there is no incongruity in the inference of the simple ‘desire to speak’; because it is always there;—for the purpose of establishing the fact of its being produced by the speaker’s breath and so forth

For example (the form of the inference would be)—this man is cognised as having had the desire to speak of the tree,—because he has uttered the word ‘tree’,—just as i had done under previous circumstances

tatra yadi api gām smṛtvā tat jñānam upajāyate | sannidheḥ gavaya stha tvāt bhavet indriya gocaram || 	Though the said cognition appears on the remembrance of the cow,—yet, on account of subsisting in the gavaya, there is proximity (of the similarity, to the senses), and hence it would be within reach of the senses.”

tasyām eva vyavasthāyām yat vijñānam pravarttate | paśunā etena tulyaḥ asau gopiṇḍaḥ iti sā upamā || 	Under the said circumstances, the cognition that appears in the form, ‘the cow is similar to this animal’, is what is called analogical cognition.”

pratyakṣeṇa avabuddhe ca sādṛśye ca gavi smṛte | viśiṣṭasya anyatas asiddheḥ upamāyāḥ pramāṇa tā || 	Similarity having been apprehended by sense-perception,—and the cow haying been remembered,—the two together (i.e. the cow qualified by similarity) are not cognisable by any other means of cognition; hence herein lies the functioning of analogy as a means of cognition.” 
pratyakṣe api yathā deśe smaryamāṇe api pāvake | viśiṣṭa viṣaya tvena na anumāna apramāṇa tā || 	For instance, in the case of the well-known inference of fire from smoke] though the place is perceived by sense-perception, and the fire (in the kitchen) is remembered,—yet the cognition of the two together (i.e. the fire and the place in the hill), does not cease to be inferential

(b) Nor can it be regarded as inference, because the ‘three-features’ are not there; for instance, there is no probans here (which subsists in the subject); and the similarity of the cow (to the gavaya) has not been previously cognised as subsisting in the subject; and the similarity that is perceived in the gavaya cannot bring about the inference of the cow.” 
pratijñā artha eka deśa tvāt go gatasya na liṅga tā   gavayaḥ ca api asambandhāt na go liṅga tvam ṛcchati || 	The similarity residing in the cow cannot serve as the probans, as it forms a part of the proposition itself. the gavaya also cannot serve as the probans indicative of the cow, as it has no connection with the cow.” 
na ca apramāṇam tat jñānam ajñāta artha prakāśanāt | gavaya adarśanāt pūrvam tad sādṛśya anavagrahāt || 	The cognition in question cannot be regarded as not a form of right cognition; because it makes known what is not already known; for instance, before the perception of the gavaya, its similarity (in the cow) has not been apprehended at all.”

How too could there be any ‘connection’ with such manifold ‘commonalty’? [says the opponent]—“There is a means of cognition which brings about the cognition of such commonalty, in the form of the inference that—commonalty is an entity and is apprehended by sense-perception, because it is cognisable as something other than negation,—like the unique entity”.—[the answer to this follows in the following text 1545.] 
abhāva pakṣa nikṣipta sāmānya artha pravādinām | asiddhiḥ ādi asādhye ca pratijñā artha eka deśa tā || 	The reason (premise) here put forward is ‘not admissible’ for those who declare that anything cognisable in the form of ‘commonalty’ (or universal) falls tinder the category of the ‘non-existent and in the case of the former of the two probanda (put forth), the premiss becomes part of the proposition itself

It is for this reason that, there does not arise any idea of the horse and other animals, through that similarity,—but it does arise when the gavaya is seen. otherwise, if there were no such remembrance, what would be the difference (between the case of the cow and that of the horse)?

How then could it be regarded as a distinct form of valid cognition? Or, similarity may be an entity, residing in the cow, like the commonalty (or universal); even so, it will have been perceived in the cow standing before the person before he sees the co-relative (gavaya); and as such the cognition of the said similarity following upon the seeing of the gavaya cannot escape from being of the nature of remembrance.—[says the other party]—“What has been previously seen in the cow is similarity merely existing there, and it has not been definitely ascertained that it is similarity to the gavaya; while this latter is what is apprehended by analogical cognition, which, thus, is different from remembrance.” 
yadi nāma gṛhītam naḥ nāmnā tena eva tat purā | gṛhītam tu svarūpeṇa yat asya ātmā abhidhīyate || 	Even if the similarity had not been previously apprehended under that name, it was apprehended all the same, in its own form, which is called its very self 
na nāma rūpam vastūnām yat tasya agrahaṇe sati | parijñāta ātma tattvānām api avijñāta tā bhavet || 	Mere name does not constitute the ‘essence’ of things; by virtue of which, when it (the name) has not been apprehended, the things could be regarded as ‘not known’, by people who know the true nature of the self 
etāvatā ca leśena pramāṇa tva vyavasthitau | na iyat tā syāt pramāṇānām anyathā api pramāṇataḥ || 	If on the strength of the slight element of valid cognition (found in analogical cognition),—it were to be regarded as an independent form of cognition,—then there could be no limit to the number of such independent forms of cognition; specially as there are other ways in which such slight elements of cognition could be found

gavayasya upalambhe ca turaṅga ādau pravarttate | tat vaisādṛśya vijñānam yat tat anyā pramā na kim || abhāva antargatam no ced na evam bhāva avalambanāt | anyonya abhāva tāyām vā samam sādṛśya buddhiṣu || 	When one sees the gavaya, there appears the notion of its ‘dissimilarity’ to the horse and other animals; why cannot this be a distinct form of cognition?—If it be urged that “it cannot be so regarded because it is included under negation”,—then, the same might be said in regard to the notions of ‘similarity’ which also are included under ‘mutual negation’ 
sādṛśyasya vivesaḥ hi yathā tatra pramīyate | sarva avayava sāmānya vivekaḥ gamyate tathā || 	Just as distinction from ‘similarity’ is cognised in that case, so also is distinction from ‘all common parts’ cognised in the other case also

Because any other cognition could only recapitulate what has been already cognised; as in the case of the notions of ‘fragrant’ and ‘sweet—thus the notion of the connection of the name cannot escape prom being op' the nature of remembrance 
ananta upāya janyāḥ ca samākhyā yoga saṃvidaḥ | sādharmyam an apekṣya api jāyante narapa ādiṣu || 	Notions of connection with names are produced by endless means, even apart from similarity; as is found in the case of such names as ‘nampa’ (king) and the like

Similarly inference also.”—This is not right; as the probans cited is not invariably concomitant (with the probandum); and specially because nothing is put forward which would negative the contrary of the desired conclusion.—Further, in this way, you would be running counter to the doctrine of ‘four forms of cognition’. The answer that you would have to that would also serve here

Nor is there any contradistinction whereby the latter could indicate the eating at night.—Nor can a second (and totally different) meaning be attributed to the words (speaking of the day); because these are already taken up in expressing another idea.—From all this it follows that the idea in question (of eating at night) is derived from a totally different sentence present only in the mind of the person.—Thus then, this sentence (in the mind), though it is not actually verbally expressed, is yet duly cognised,—and it has to be pointed out which one among the means of cognition, perception and the rest, it is which brings about the cognition of the said (unspoken) sentence.—As the sentence is not actually spoken, it could not be perception; nor could it be inference, because the sentence has never been found to be concomitant with the other factor; and if, even when this relation (of concomitance) has never been perceived, the factor concerned were regarded as an inferential indicative,—then the utterance of any one sentence might bring about the cognition of all sentences; because on the point of being unrelated, there would be no distinction between one sentence and another.”—[Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti, 56-61.]

When the object cognised, is either the man connected with the exterior (of the house), or the exterior connected with the man,—in either case, how could ‘absence in the house’ serve as the probans (residing in that subject)?—[ibid., 10-12].—What is regarded as the probans in this case is the ‘absence of the living man in the house’; and there can be no cognition of this absence without knowing his presence outside the house. [ibid., 19].—As for pure ‘absence in the house’,—apart from the idea of his being alive—such absence is found in the case of dead persons also, and hence cannot be a proof of his presence outside”.—[ibid., 21]

artha gati anapekṣeṇa yadi vākya antaram punar | sārtham ākṣipyate tena syāt ākṣepaḥ vacaḥ ntare || 	If another expressive statement is indicated (in presumption) by the first statement, independently of what is expressed by itself,—then that other statement also would indicate another statement 
atha upagama rūpeṇa tatra artha gatiḥ iṣyate | pramāṇa antarataḥ yat vā bhavatu artha gatiḥ tatas || 	If, the idea of what is expressed by the sentence is admitted as emanating from the other person, or as brought about by another means of cognition,—then the cognition of what is expressed by the later sentence may be regarded as following from that 
kṣapā bhojana sambandhī pumān iṣṭaḥ pratīyate | divā bhojana vaikalya pīna tvena tad anya vat || 	What is cognised is the man spoken of as related to eating at night;—on the ground of his being fat while going without food during the day,—like another person 
bhojane sati pīna tvam anvaya vyatirekataḥ | niścitam tena sambaddhāt vastunaḥ vastutaḥ gatiḥ || 	That there is fatness when there is eating is known with certainty through positive and negative concomitance; and hence the cognition of one thing follows from the other which is thus related to it 
sarva sambandha śūnyam hi katham vākyam pratīyate | ekasmāt vākyataḥ sarvam pratīyeta anyathā punar || 	How can a sentence be cognised, which is devoid of all relationship? otherwise all things would be cognised through a single thing 
tathā hi asati sambandhe sati ca anavadhārite | gamyamānam idam vākyam prasajyeta apramāṇakam || 	When there is no relationship—or when, even though existent, the relationship is not definitely known,—if the other sentence were indicated, it would be unreliable (invalid), 
sambaddhasya pramāṇa tvam sthitam no ced nṛpa ājñayā | pratyakṣasya pramāṇa tvam katham vā saṅgatim vinā || 	There is no such royal edict as that ‘that alone is valid which is related’. how does validity attach to perception, in which there is no relationship?”

Because in the matter of being unrelated, no distinction among things can be perceived. In the case of perception also, validity rests upon relationship only. The validity of a cognition consists in its being in conformity (with the real state of things), and this conformity depends upon the perception owing its existence to the thing perceived,

Or else, there would be conformity with all (things)

If directly (immediately), then the thing would not be ‘imperceptible’, being exactly like the perceptible thing. If the cognitions are dependent upon something else (i.e. indirect, mediate), would the cognition be related to it or not related? Would it envisage distinction or not?—If it arose out of what is not related, then there could be no restriction; and if it envisages distinction, then there could be no invariable concomitance. If, lastly, the cognition envisages an imperceptible thing,—is based upon a related object—and does not envisage distinction from it,—then it is clearly ‘inference’

On the other hand, if it were entirely devoid of non-equality (difference), then it could not be regarded as anything different from those things

Thus then, one who wishes the entity to be not-equal to the ‘sky-flower’ must accept the universal ‘entity’ as the character common to all entities “If it were not as asserted, then, to what would this fact be due—that the common notion of ‘entity’ does not appear in connection with the ‘crow’s teeth’, while it always appears as restricted to entities alone?—If it be urged that—the said restriction is due to similarity’,—then our answer is that, that same (similarity) is what we call ‘commonalty’.—This same remark applies also to the view that ‘the said restriction is due to a certain capacity in the nature of things’.—Absolute difference (from other entities) therefore is not possible for any entity; because entities do not differ from each other, on the point of being ‘entities’.”

Consequently, when one has to accept some sort of difference among things, he has to accept ‘dissimilarity’ also, and thence also the ‘particular’ character of things.”

nanu sati eka rūpa tve dharma bhedaḥ na siddhyati | akalpitaḥ vibhedaḥ hi nānā tvam abhidhīyate || 	In fact, if the thing has only one form, it cannot have diverse properties; a diversity that is not a creation of fancy is what is called ‘plurality’

In this way even a single thing may be assumed to have numberless diverse forms; but in reality, no single thing can reasonably have two forms

As a matter of fact, Narasiṃha is of the nature of an aggregate of many atoms, and is not endowed with any one uniform form; what is variegated (various) cannot be one,—as is found in the case of the collection of several kinds of gems.—If there were one form, there could not be a dual character and the consequent appearance of several shapes; and even if the smallest part of the body that could be covered by the leg of a fly were hidden, the body could not be said to be not-hidden

In this same way are the variegated gems and other cases disposed of.—The variegated character, based upon the presence of several forms, is certainly incompatible with unity

Generally, one thing is held to be productive of another, only by reason of the, presence, in it, of the capacity for that action; if then, that capacity is equally present in another thing, why should not this be productive of the same?—If the ‘blue’ and other objects themselves are held to constitute the all-embracing character of ‘entity’, then the white and yellow things also would do what is done by the blue one; and in that case, the whole universe would become a single ‘entity devoid of a second; and thus it would not be true that a single thing has several aspects.—If the blue, etc. themselves do not constitute ‘entity’,—and this is like the ‘being’ (sattva) posited by ‘Kaṇāda’,—then it cannot be as you hold, that one thing cannot have several aspects; as there would be clear difference—Further, what constitutes ‘difference’ among things is the presence of contrary properties, and no other kind of ‘difference’ is held to lie between ‘blue’ and ‘yellow this same condition is present between the ‘general’ and the ‘particular’; because while the former is ‘inclusive’, the latter is otherwise. Why then should not ‘difference’ be admitted as clearly lying between them?

ekasmāt vastunaḥ anya tve tādātmya vikalam bhavet | na ākāśa puṣpa saṅkāśam tat hi api artha kriyā kṣamam || 	If a certain thing were excluded from one ‘entity’, it would be devoid of sameness only with that entity; it would not become like the ‘sky-flower’;—as it would still be capable of efficient action

Thus, even though there is absolute difference, there is a subjective similarity; and thus an ‘entity’ being ‘equal’ to other entities, becomes distinguished from the ‘sky-flower’

tena eva asau svabhāvena samānaḥ iti gamyate | eka pratyavamarśasya hetu tvena anya bhedataḥ || 	It is in that same form that it is understood to be similar, because the cause of such understanding is present, in the shape of being the cause of one and the same conception, as differentiating these from other things

Because the nature of the eye, etc. is also regarded as the cause; and it is not possible for anything to be ‘excluded’ from its own nature; if there were ‘exclusion’ of a thing from its own nature, the thing would become devoid of all character. When ‘exclusion’ is spoken of, it is exclusion from another cause that is meant; what is meant being that the eye is not of the form of that other cause and this is quite acceptable to us,—it is not that what is productive of the cognition is described precisely as it exists. In fact, all cognitions proceed from their own specific causes. If, on the ground of their being of the same nature, they were regarded as a single productive cause,—then, as the said nature itself is there (as the cause’, what would be the use of other auxiliaries if it be held that—‘on account of defects in other particulars, the one (nature) is not productive (of the cognition)’,—then (the answer is that) those causes are incapable (of bringing about the cognition in question), by reason of difference. If there were no difference, how could they be defective?—Just as, even when there is difference—as among particular things,—everything is not the cause of every other thing,—in the same way, even though there would be no difference in ‘plurality’, yet there would be restriction (of only some causes bringing about some effects). Even when there is difference, it is only a certain thing that would be productive of the particular effect by reason of its nature. In the case of ‘inclusiveness’, how could the one thing be productive and non-productive of the same one thing?—If there is difference in this case also,—the difference may be there; but is that difference from that thing only? There can be no difference apart from the ‘inclusive’ (productive cause); and this is non-productive. In fact, that alone is a real entity which is capable of effective action; and this entity is non-inclusive; and from what is inclusive, the effect is not produced. In fact difference and nondifference can be not-imagin ary (real) only in relation to that form or nature in reference to which the man has recourse to activity. Otherwise the difference is there by its very ‘nature’, and the ‘general’ character also is there being due to ‘exclusion the thing itself is not ‘inclusive’ (comprehensive); as in that case there would be most incongruous activities 
kalpanā racitasya eva vaicitryasya upavarṇane | kaḥ nāma atiśayaḥ proktaḥ vipra nirgrantha kāpilaiḥ || 	In case the ‘variegated character’ of things spoken of refers only to conceptual creation (fancy),—then what would be the difference in the assertions made by ‘vipras’, ‘nirgranthas’ and ‘kāpilas’?

na nāśena vinā śokaḥ na utpādena vinā sukham | sthityā vinā na mādhyasthyam tena sāmānya nitya tā || 	As a matter of fact, there can be no sorrow without destruction, and there can be no happiness without production; and there can be no neutrality without continuance. it is in this way that the universal (commonalty) is eternal.”—[Ślokavārtika-vanavāda, 23] 
iti etat api naḥ yuktam asāmānya āśraya tvataḥ  | utpāda sthiti bhaṅgānām eka artha āśraya tā na hi || samāna kāla tā prāpteḥ paraspara virodhinām  | idam tu kṣuṇa bhaṅgi tve sati sarvam anākulam  || varddhamānaka bhāvasya kaladhauta ātmanaḥ katham | ananvaye vināśe hi kasyacid śoka sambhavaḥ || sarvathā pūrvarūpasya rucakasya tad ātmanaḥ | janmani utpadyate prītiḥ na avasthānam tu kasyacid 	This is not right; because of the absence of a common substratum; production, continuance and destruction cannot have the same substratum; for if they had, it would involve the presence at the same time of all these mutually contradictory properties. All this would be free from difficulties under the doctrine of ‘perpetual flux’; for why should any man be sorry at the absolute destruction of gold in the form of the pot? Why too should there be any joy at the production of the gold in the new form of the dish? As for continuance, there is none, of anything at all

How too could mystics have the distinct cognition of past and future.

Because this distinction among the states is conceived on the basis of activity. that which is engaged in activity is called ‘present’; that which has ceased from activity is called ‘past’; and that which has not yet attained activity is called ‘future’.—The ‘activity’ of things serves only to ‘project’ the result, not to produce it. As there can be no such ‘projecting’ in the case of past things, there is no possibility of activity in them.”

ananya tve api kāritram dharmāt avyatirekataḥ | svarūpam iva dharmasya prasaktam sārvakālikam || tatas ca adhva vibhāgaḥ ayam tad vaśāt na prakalpyate | na hi tasya cyutiḥ prāptiḥ aprāptiḥ vā vibhāgataḥ || 	If, on the other hand, the ‘activity’ is not different from the entity, then, being inseparable from the entity, it would be there at all times, just like the nature of the entity; and in that case, the division among the states could not be made on the basis of this activity; as there could be no such distinction as that between cessation, and non-attainment, of the said activity 
kāritra avyatirekāt vā dharmaḥ kāritra vat bhavet | pūrva apara vyavacchinna madhya mātraka sarvavān || 	Or (conversely),, because it would be non-different from the activity—the entity, like the activity, would be devoid of the ‘previous’ and ‘later’ conditions, and would have its sole existence in the middle (present) 
kāritram sarvadā na asti sadā dharmaḥ ca varṇyate | dharmāt na anyat ca kāritram vyaktam deva viceṣṭitam || kāritra antara sāpekṣā tatra api adhva sthitiḥ yadi | tulyaḥ paryanuyogaḥ ayam nanu sarvatra dhāvati || 	Activity is not there always,—and the entity is described as being there at all times,—and yet the activity is said to be non-different from the entity;—certainly this is conduct worthy of a divine being!—Even if it be held that the existence of the states (in the activity itself) is dependent upon other activities,—the same question would be equally well raised against that view also 
svarūpāt vyatiriktaḥ api dṛṣṭaḥ sapratigha tva vat | viśeṣaḥ ced idam na eva prakṛtasya upakārakam || na hi sapratigha tva ādiḥ padārthasya anugāminaḥ | kādācitkaḥ mataḥ kaścid bhāvasya eva tathā udbhavāt || 	Properties distinct from the entity have also been found to qualify it; for instance, the quality of ‘resistance’”,—if this is urged, this cannot help the matter under discussion; such characters as that of resistance and the like are not present in the entity at all times; they have been regarded as occasional; because the entity itself is produced in that way 
an ākṣipta anya bhedena bhāvaḥ eva tathā ucyate | tad rūpasya iti śabdena cetasaḥ vāsanā api ca || 	It is the entity itself, when it does not indicate ‘difference from other things’, that is spoken of by the words ‘it is of the form’; just as ‘disposition’ is spoken of as ‘of the mind’

Thus then, as the presence of the ‘activity’ would not be real, any determining of the states based upon that ‘activity’ could not be real

abhedam anumanyante katham adhvasu vastunaḥ  | tāḥ a bhūtvā bhavantyaḥ ca naśyantyaḥ ca tad ātmikāḥ  || avasthāyām ca madhyāyām svarūpeṇa eva kārakam  | tat tat eva svarūpam ca daśayoḥ anyayoḥ api || tadā kriyā kriyā bhraṃśau katham asya tayoḥ matau  | para rūpeṇa kartṛ tve prāptā asya akartṛ tā punar  || atīta anāgata avastham anyat ced anala ādikam  | tad sāṅkarya ādi doṣaḥ ayam asmin pakṣe nirāspadaḥ || tat idānīm a bhūtvā eva kārya yo 	How do these people accept the view that there is non-difference between the entity and the states?—They (the states), not having been in existence, come into existence and then become destroyed;—how then could they be the same as the entity?—In the middle ‘state’, the entity is ‘active’ in its own form,—then, as the same form persists in other two states also, how could ‘activity’ and ‘cessation of activity’ be there in these two states?—If it is ‘active’, in the form of something else, then it ceases to be active again.—if, lastly, it be held that the fire and other things, in the past and future states, are different from the same in the present state,—then it is true that there would be no room for the objection that comingling and confusion would be involved; but even so, as the entity in the middle (present) state becomes capable of fruitful action only when it comes into existence after the time during which it was not in existence, and after having come into existence, it does not continue to exist,—there would be no continuity of existence for the entity 
saḥ eva bhāvikaḥ bhāvaḥ yaḥ eva ayam kriyā kṣamaḥ  | sa ca na asti tayoḥ yaḥ asti na tasmāt kārya sambhavaḥ || 	As a matter of fact, that entity alone is real which is capable of action; hence from that which is not so in the two states,—no effect can proceed

That however, which has its existence dependent upon a cause must be called ‘present’.—Then again, other people have postulated that ‘modification’ of form, etc. is different in character from ‘pratīsaṅkhyānirodha’ (dissociation from impurities brought about by transcendental knowledge), and other ‘eternal verities’; and this ‘modification’ or embellishment of form and other things, comes about through birth, existence, etc.; now what is that peculiarity by producing which, birth is said to be ‘productive’ of the thing? Is it something non-different from the ‘unborn’ form? Or different from it? If the peculiarity is non-different from the form, then there can be no ‘production’ of it; as it would, in that case, be there even before the ‘birth just as after it. As for a different peculiarity, there can be no such,—because by reason of this difference, there can be no relation between them. Further, as it would not be existent before, it would involve the notion that the effect was not existent (which is incompatible with the opponent’s doctrines).—Similarly if there were ‘reversal of character’, ‘continuance’ and ‘destruction’ (brought about respectively by the embellishments of ‘decay’, ‘stability’ and ‘non-eternality’),—the objections based upon their being ‘different or non-different’, ‘decay’ and the rest, would be applicable to these also 
sva kārya ārambhiṇaḥ ime sāmarthya niyama ātmanā | jāti ādayaḥ ca tad rūpam prāk paścāt api vidyate || samartha rūpa bhāvāt ca prārabhante na kim tadā | sva anurūpām kriyām tasyāḥ prārambhe ca amita adhva tā || 	These, ‘birth’ and the rest, are productive of their effects, in accordance with the limitations of their nature; and this capacity of theirs is there before as well as after; this potent form thus being there at all times, why should they not proceed with the activity in keeping with their nature? At the starting of such activity there can be no limitation on the ‘states 
kiṃca atīta ādayaḥ bhāvāḥ kṣaṇikāḥ syuḥ na vā yadi | ādyāḥ punar tayoḥ prāptā sā eva aparimita adhva tā || yaḥ kṣaṇaḥ jāyate tatra vartamānaḥ bhavati asau | utpadya yaḥ vinaṣṭaḥ ca saḥ atītaḥ bhāvi anāgataḥ || 	Further, would the ‘past’ and other entities be momentary, or not?—If the former, then there is the same absence of restriction.—The ‘moment’ that is born becomes the ‘present’,—that which, on being born, becomes destroyed, becomes the ‘past’,—and that which is yet to be born becomes the ‘future’ 
atha api akṣaṇikāḥ te syuḥ kṛtāntaḥ te virudhyate | kṣaṇikāḥ sarva saṃskārāḥ siddhānte hi prakāśitāḥ  || yukti bādhā api santaḥ ced niyamāt kṣaṇabhaṅginaḥ | vartamānāḥ iva prāk tu pratibandhaḥ atra sādhitaḥ || 	1833) The view in question is opposed to reason also: if the things are existent, they must be momentary, like present things. the invariable concomitance between these two terms has been already established before

Or not?—If they have that capacity, then they must be regarded as ‘present’, like other ‘present’ things.—If the ‘past’ and the ‘future’ are not regarded as ‘present’, then they must be devoid of all capacities,—just like the ‘sky-lotus’,—the ākāśa and other ‘non-produced’ (eternal) things are open to the same objection; hence these cannot serve to make our reason ‘inconclusive’,—in the case of all entities, their restricted capacity for effective action must be due to some cause; if it were without a cause, everything would be used for everything. In fact, the restricted capacity for effective action must be brought about by a cause; and there is no other characteristic feature of the ‘present’ thing. In the case of the ‘past’ and ‘future’ also, the said capacity is there fully complete, according to your view; wherefore then should not the character of the ‘present’ be attributed to them? 
svarga apavarga saṃsarga yatnaḥ ayam aphaḥ tatas  | īhā sādhyam na kiñcid hi phalam atra upalakṣyate || 	As a consequence of this, all attempt to attain heaven and final beatitude would be futile; as no fruit is found that could be attained by effort 
atha na artha kriyā śaktiḥ teṣām abhyupagamyate | yadi evam atas eva eṣām asattvam vyoma puṣpa vat || 	If, on the other hand, the past and future things are held to be without the capacity for effective action,—then, on that ground alone, they would be non-existent,—like the ‘sky-flower’, 
hetavaḥ bhāva dharmāḥ tu na asiddhe siddhi bhāginaḥ | vartamāna tva siddheḥ vā viruddhāḥ dharmi bādhanāt || 	As regards the reasons that have been adduced, they must reside in things; and until these things are established, the reasons cannot be admitted.—Or else, on account of the ‘present’ character being established, the said reasons are ‘contradictory’,—as going against the nature of the subject 
bhūtvā yat vigatam rūpam tat atītam prakāśitam  | sati pratyaya sākalye bhāvi yat tat anāgatam || sattve tu varttamāna tvam āsajyeta iti sādhitam  | vidyamāna tva mātram hi vartamānasya lakṣaṇam || 	That form which, having come into existence, has ceased to exist, has been described as ‘past’ ‘and that which is to come when the causal factors are complete has been described as ‘future’,—if the ‘existence’ of this were insisted upon, then they must be regarded as ‘present’; this is what has been just proved; as the only characteristic of the ‘present’ is that it should be existent 
rūpa ādi tvam atīta ādeḥ bhūtām tām bhāvinīm tathā  | adhyāropya daśām asya kathyate na tu bhāvataḥ || 	When form, etc. are attributed to the past and future things, it is through imposing upon them their past and future conditions; and not in reality 
dvayam pratītya vijñānam yat uktam tattva darśinā | sa iṣṭā sa viṣayam cittam abhisandhāya deśanā || 	When the seer of truth declared that cognition proceeds from two causes,—this teaching was in view of the cognition with an object 
nityeśvara ādi buddhīnām na eva ālambanam asti hi | śabda nāma ādi dharmāṇām tad ākāra viyuktitaḥ || 	In the case of the cognitions of ‘eternal things’, ‘god’ and so forth,—there is no objective background; as words and names are devoid of the forms of those 
bodha anugati mātreṇa vijñānam iti ca ucyate | sā ca asya ajaḍa rūpa tvam prākāśyāt parikalpitam || 	It is called ‘cognition’ only by virtue of the presence of the nature of ‘consciousness’; and this ‘consciousness’ also consists in the cognition being not-dark which is deduced from its being luminous 
vipāka hetuḥ phala daḥ na atītaḥ abhyupagamyate | sat vāsitāt tu vijñāna prabandhāt phalam iṣyate || 	What brings about the fruit is the cause of fruition,—not anything ‘past’, in fact, the fruit is held to proceed from the ‘chain’ of cognitions impressed by the entity (when present) 
tām eva vāsanām cetaḥ santatau adhikṛtya tat | asti karma iti nirdiṣṭam bhaktyā mūla vināśavat || 	In view of the said impression being attributed to the ‘series of cognitions’, the lord has said that ‘there is karma’, which assertion is figurative; as the principal (of the debt) is said to be ‘not destroyed (lost)’ 
uccheda dṛṣṭi nāśāya ca evam śāstrā prakāśitam | anyathā śūnyatā sūtre deśanā nīyate katham || 	The matter has been explained in this way by the teacher, for the purpose of removing the notion of the utter annihilation (of past acts). Otherwise, how could he explain the teaching imparted in the aphorism declaring the ‘void’?

sa rāga maraṇam cittam na citta antara sandhi kṛt | maraṇa jñāna bhāvena vīta kleśasya tat yathā || 	The dying consciousness of the man beset with affections cannot bring about the contiguity of another mind (or consciousness),—because it is dying consciousness,—just like the dying consciousness of the person free from the ‘afflictions’ (passions and impurities)” 
kāyāt eva tatas jñānam prāṇa apāna ādi adhiṣṭhitāt | yuktam jāyate iti etat kambalāśvatara uditam || 	From this it follows that the right view is that consciousness proceeds from the body itself which is equipped with the five life-breaths—prāṇa, apāna and the rest;—as has been declared by Kambalāśvatara.”

So that at the end, when the body has ceased to exist, wherein could the consciousness subsist?”

How too could the consciousness, residing in different bodies, be related to the same ‘chain of cognitions’,—being like the consciousness of the elephant, the horse and other animals?—For these reasons, as the substratum of consciousness, you have either to seek for a beginningless and endless transmigrating personality,—or accept pure materialism.”

atha kṣaṇikam eva idam paraiḥ api abhidhīyate | katham sva upagamaḥ teṣām evam sati na bādhyate || 	If the other party assert that “these elemental substances are momentary (not eternal)”,—then, in that case, why cannot their own doctrine be regarded as rejected by this?

na avayavi ātma tā teṣām na api yuktā aṇu rūpa tā | ayogāt paramāṇūnām iti etat abhidhāsyate || 	The primary elemental substances cannot exist in the form of composite wholes, nor in the form of atoms; because there can be no conjunction of atoms,—as is going to be explained

tad anyasya tad ābhāsebhāve hetu tvam na upapadyate | prāk bhūtam bhūta nirbhāsam jñānam tu janayet parama || 	It is not possible that what is something different from the cognation should figure in it; it is only a previous cognition envisaging the substances that could produce another such cognition

tasmāt tatra ādi vijñānam sva upādāna bala udbhavam | vijñāna tva ādi hetubhyaḥ idānīntana citta vat || 	Thus then the first cognition must be regarded as arising out of its own material cause,—because it is cognition and so forth,—like the cognition of the present moment

If then, the ‘subsistence’ (of the cognitions in the bodies) be assumed to be of the nature of ‘identification’ (sameness’,—that also cannot be right. because for you, cognition cannot be of the nature of the body

The body undergoing destruction every moment, the previous consciousness brings about an unbroken continuity of consciousness in such succeeding bodies. If, by reason of their occurring in the same chain, the two bodies be held to be not different from another,—then in the other case also, there could be no difference, on the same ground of occurrence in the same chain 
kṣīṇa āsravasya vijñānam asandhānam kutas matam | parakīya kṛtāntāt ced na prāmāṇya aparigrahāt || 	Why has it been held that the consciousness of the person free from the impurities of the affections is non-contiguous? —If this view is held in accordance with the doctrine of others,—that cannot be right; because the authority (and validity) of these doctrines is not accepted (by the materialist)

bādhaka anabhidhānāt ca sandigdha vyatireki tā | śaṅkyamāna vijātīya sadbhāvāt vyabhicāri tā || 	Inasmuch as no argument has been adduced as negativing the contrary,—there is an uncertainty regarding the negative concomitance (of the probans with the probandum); so that, there being a suspicion regarding the presence (of the probans) in the contrary of the pobandum,—the probans remains ‘inconclusive’

In case your idea proceeds thus—“we do not cognise any consciousness at the time”,—then that itself proves the presence of consciousness at the time.—It might be argued that—“if consciousness is present during the said states, then why is there no remembrance of it on awakening, etc.?”—This fact (of non-remembrance) is not effective (in refuting our view); the absence of remembrance is due to the absence of vividness and other conditions (in the consciousness)—as in the case of the consciousness of the newborn infant

Directly, the objects are not the cause of the feelings; if they were, a single affliction would be the cause of them all,—in regard to the object,—like the cognition of things 
anya vṛtti upalambhena parebhyaḥ śravaṇena vā | na ca teṣām iyam vṛttiḥ vyabhicāra upalambhanāt || 	The appearance of the feelings cannot be due either to the perception of the doings of others, or to hearing of things from other persons;—because such is not found to be the case always 
adṛṣṭa aśruta vṛttāntāḥ varāha hariṇa ādayaḥ | sabhāga gati saṃparke prayānti eva hi vikriyām || 	Boars, bucks and other animals,—who have never seen or heard of the doings,—become perturbed at the touch of females of their own kind

tasya api anubhave asiddhe prathamasya api asiddha tā | tatra anya saṃvid utpattau anavasthā prasajyate || 	If the said cognition of the apprehension is not cognised, then the preceding one remains uncognised. If of that also, yet another cognition were postulated, then there would be an infinite regress

And yet such cognition is actually found to appear. And if there is cognition of another object, the last of the series of cognitions could not be cognised by any other cognition; so that that would remain uncognised; and if that is not cognised, all the rest of the series must remain uncognised; so that the entire world becomes bund (unconscious).—If then, the first cognition be regarded as self-cognised, then the same may surely be said of the others also;—because they are all cognition; otherwise, they would not be cognition at all,—like the jar and such things 
vijñānam janayat rūpe cakṣuḥ tasya prakāśakam | matu tasya avabodha tvāt tad jñānena asya kopamā || 	The eye is regarded as ‘illuminative’ of colour, because it brings about the cognition of colour,—not because it is its apprehension; what similarity then can the eye have to cognition?

For example, the cognition of the blue, or the second moon;—and this is the cognition of blue, because it apprehends the blue form 
na jñāna ātmā parātmā iti nīla dhī vedane katham | nīla ākārasya saṃvittiḥ tayoḥ no ced abhinna tā || 	The ‘nature of cognition’ not being the ‘nature of the other thing’ [according to the other party];—how could there be apprehension of the blue form, when there is apprehension of the cognition of the blue,—if there is no non-difference between these two? 
saṃvedanam idam sarvam na ca artha antara gocaram | saṃvedanam ca nīlasya sva ātma saṃvedanam yathā || 	All this cognition does not envisage other things; there is cognition of the blue;—like the cognition of the cognition itself

astu tarhi sa sārūpyam vijñānam bāhya vedakam | tasya api sarvathā ayogāt na yuktā vedaka sthitiḥ || 	Says the other party]—“the cognition endowed with similarity of form may be the apprehender of the external object”.—That also being impossible, it cannot have the position of the apprehender

sarva ātmanā ca sārūpye jñāne ajñāna ādi tā bhavet | sāmye kenacid aṃśena sarvam syāt sarva vedakam || 	If the cognition were entirely like the object,—then it would have the character of non-cognition (ignorance), etc. If there is only partial likeness, then every cognition should apprehend every object 
anya ākāram api jñānam katham anyasya vedakam | sarvaḥ syāt sarva saṃvedyaḥ na hetuḥ ca niyāmakaḥ || 	How can the cognition envisaging (having the form of) one object apprehend another object? If it did so, everything would be apprehended by every cognition; and there would be no basis for restriction 
yathā hi bhavatām jñānam nirākāram ca tattvataḥ  | vetti ca abhūtam ākāram bhūtam saṃrva tathā eva ced || 	just as your cognition, which is formless in reality, apprehends forms which are non-objective,—in the same way would it apprehend all things.”

An entity however which has no form, cannot be ‘dependent upon the same form’, nor could the other condition be fulfilled. Hence of such an entity, there can be no ‘apprehension’, even in the figurative sense.”

If you also speak through illusion of the cognition apprehending such a thing,—then it becomes clearly non-objective 
sākāram tat nirākāram yuktam na anyasya vedakam | iti bauddhe api vijñāne na tu cintā pravarttate || 	Whether with form or formless, it does not apprehend anything else; hence in regard to the Buddha’s cognition, the questions do not arise 
anya rāga ādi saṃvittau tad sārūpya samudbhavāt | prāpnoti āvṛti sadbhāvaḥ aupalambhika darśane || 	If he had the cognition of the love and hate, etc. in other persons,—this could arise only from similarity to such love, etc.; and this would imply the presence of ‘obscuration’,—under the view of the ‘apprehensionist’

Even though he has no cognitions, all men regard the blessed Jina (Buddha) to be omniscient; because by reason of the absence of limitations, he knows all things, without exception,—as is clear from what he does (for the welfare of people) 
dhiyaḥ asita ādi rūpa tve sā tasya anubhavaḥ katham | dhiyaḥ sita ādi rūpa tve bāhyaḥ arthaḥ kiṃpramāṇakaḥ || 	If the cognition is not of the ‘white’ and other forms,—then, how can it be the apprehension of the object? if it is of the form of ‘white’, etc., then what is the evidence for the external object? 
nīla ādi pratibhāsasya saṃvādi tvena sādhyate | jñāna ākāra tayā tulya jātīyāt janma bodha vat || 	The fact of the appearance of the blue and other forms being produced by something of the same kind is sought to be proved by its being the form of the cognition which is in conformity with the reality,—like the consciousness.”

How is it possible that it should not figure there and yet be cognised? It is certainly a contradiction in terms to say that ‘one cognises it’ and ‘one does not cognise it’.—It is for these reasons that it is not difficult to prove that cognitions are self-cognised; because such is found to be the cognition in everything which is of the nature of ‘light’.—From all this it follows that it is not true that “the wrong cognition, while apprehending the object, apprehends it as otherwise than it really exists, and thus envisages itself (?)”

apṛthak vedanāt pūrvam tat atra pratipāditāt | aikarūpya a parijñāna paryanteṣu na siddha tā || 	Because the two are never cognised separately, as explained before,—therefore all the reasons adduced (by Kumārila); down to the ‘non-cognition of sameness’, should be rejected as ‘inadmissible’ 
sa bahis deśa sambaddhaḥ iti anena nanu ucyate | grāhya ākārasya saṃvittiḥ grāhaka anubhavāt ṛte || 	The cognition of the form of the apprehended (object) is spoken of as ‘connected with external space’, and as appearing without the cognition of the apprehender (cognition).”

If the two were non-different, there would be remembrance of the apprehended object also, when there is remembrance of the apprehending cognition;—as a matter of fact however, there is idea of the apprehending cognition only. Thus the difference between the two becomes proved by positive and negative concomitance.—thus all these reasons become established as residing in the minor term.”—[Ślokavārtika-śūnyavāda, 83-85]

alakṣita viśeṣā ca bāhya rūpe ca sā smṛtiḥ | sarvatas bhinna rūpe tu na sā abhyāsa ādi asambhavāt || 	The remembrance that has been cited certainly appertains to the apprehended object;—only its special features are not clearly remembered. the remembrance does not pertain to anything as distinct prom everything else; because repeated experience and other conditions cannot be there

vivāda āspadam ārūḍham vijñāna tvāt atas manaḥ | advayam vedya kartṛ tva viyogāt pratibimba vat || 	For these reasons, the cognition under dispute must be without a second,—being devoid of objective and the active agent,—because it is cognition,—like the reflection 
nanu ca pratibimbe api jñānam sa ālambanam matam | cakṣū raśmi nivṛttau hi sva mukha ādeḥ tathā īkṣaṇāt || 	In the case of reflection also, the cognition is regarded as having an objective basis; as it is found that on the visual rays being turned back, one’s own face is seen as it is in the reflection.”

sā hi pramāṇam sarveṣām narākṛta tayā sthitā  | vaitathyam pratipadyante pauruṣeyyaḥ giraḥ yatas || 	The said revealed word is authoritative for all, because it is not the work of a human being; because it is only words emanating from human beings that are found to be false.”

As regards the words of manu and others, their reliability rests upon the veda itself. As for any other writer who has no connection with the veda and is hostile towards it,—how can such a one be truthful on this point? Hence for us, there is no scripture compiled even by others which can declare an author of the veda d) In case someone were visible now who is similar to the author of the veda, then alone, on the basis of that analogy, there might be an analogical cognition of such an author 
aprāmāṇya nivṛtti arthā vedasya apauruṣeya tā | yeṣṭā sā api tu avastu tvāt sādhanīyā na sādhanaiḥ || 	As a matter of fact, the idea of the Veda not being the work of an author is emphasised only for the purpose of showing that there can be no cause for unreliability; and as such an idea (being negative) is a nonentity, it cannot be proved by means of proofs.”

nitya tvam vastu rūpam yat tat asādhayatām api | svayam bhavati tad siddhiḥ pūrvapakṣa dvaye hate || 	As regards the positive fact of the eternality of the Veda, it becomes established for us on the rejection of the ‘two ends’ (of the Veda),—even though we do not adduce proofs in support of the said eternality 
pūrvā vedasya yā koṭiḥ pauruṣeya tva lakṣaṇā | parā vināśa rūpā ca tad abhāvaḥ hi nitya tā || 	The ‘first end’ of the Veda consists in the idea of its being the work of an author,—and the ‘other end’ consists in its being destroyed; and the negation of these (two ends) means ‘eternality’.”

veda vākya artha mithyā tvam yaḥ vadati anumānataḥ | tasya vaidika vijñāna balāt pakṣaḥ nivarttate || 	One who asserts the falsity of the Vedic words on the basis of inference, has his proposition annulled by the force of the cognition derived from the Veda.”

Consequently, whenever there should be any doubt between verbal cognition and inference, it is verbal cognition that should be regarded as stronger, and the matter determined accordingly.”.

It cannot cease to be a means of cognition, on the ground that there is malice against it or because it is not popular; nor can anything become a means of cognition, on the ground that one likes it and it is popular. Even those who are hostile to the Veda do not assert any reason why it should not be a means of right cognition;—by virtue of which they could be regarded as truthful people. When people, who have been intent upon the study, the retention and the exposition of the veda and upon the performance of acts enjoined therein, have not been able to detect any grounds of falsity, how can they be detected by persons who have kept themselves aloof from it? It is only persons who are fully conversant with a thing and who have their purpose centred therein that can detect the good and bad points of that thing. Those evil-minded people on the other hand, who are hostile to Vrahman and have been far removed from the Veda,—how can those people bare-facedly speak of the good and bad points in the Veda?”.

In cases where there is notion of difference in regard to any aspect of the thing, on account of certain circumstantial conditions,—there is no recognition, as is clear from the notion of difference.”.

In the cow there is a commingling of several factors—such as the ‘earth’, ‘substance’, ‘being’, ‘tail’ and so forth,—there could be no definite idea of the ‘cow’ except through frequent repeated usage.—From this it follows that the word is not-artificial; and it never perishes,—because it has an eternal relationship with an eternal entity—like the ākāśa and the atom,”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 359-361]

As regards the ideas of peculiar features, that would be due to the diversity in the character of the manifesting agency.”Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 18, 23]

na ca paryanuyogaḥ atra kena ākāreṇa saṃskṛtiḥ | utpattau api tulya tvāt śaktiḥ tatra api atīndriyā || 	There should not be any such question as to the form in which the embellishment is made; as that question can be similarly raised in the case of the production (of the word, in the ear); as in that case also, the capacity (of the things concerned) is beyond sense-perception.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 43] 
nityam kārya anumeyā ca śaktiḥ kim anuyujyate | tad bhāva bhāvitā mātram pramāṇam tatra gamyate || 	Why should any question or objection be raised against the capacity of things, which is always inferable from its effects?

This would be exactly like ‘the capacity to produce’ (which is postulated by the other party).—Similarly peculiar forms would be inferred from particular forms of the cognition.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 121-126]

And, as these articulations appear only in limited places, there arises the notion that sound is not all-pervading. Further, as these articulations have movement and a certain velocity,—from whatever place these articulations proceed, the hearer thinks that the sound that he hears also comes from that same place.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]

It is thus that it is the sun itself that is seen below, through the intervening medium (of the downward rays).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality op words, 186-188]

As regards perception, it is actually found to be very keen if the object perceived—the jar—is illumined by a large source of light,—but less keen when it is illumined by a small light.—From all this it follows that such properties as ‘length’, ‘shortness’ and the like really belong to the articulations.”

As a matter of fact, a word is not comprehended as having a meaning until it has been heard twice or thrice.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 249-250]

He might speak of it as similar; but, in that case, it would not be possible for the hearer to recognise it as similar to that expressive word; because he has never heard that original expressive word; while the new word that he hears is not expressive.

If it be argued that—‘the same arguments apply to the jar and such things also’,—then the answer is that it is not so; because in the case of these what is recognised is the ‘universal’, whose existence has been already established;—even as regards the ‘individual’ (jar), that individual which has been perceived to be efficient cannot be set up; while that individual which may be set up has not been found to be efficient in bringing about its effect.—Even with all this, however, in the case of utterances, the potency or efficiency has been recognised on the basis of the ‘configuration’ (i.e. the ‘universal’).—This ‘universal’ can have no beginning; but your ‘connection’ has beginning.—If, in connection with that (connection) also, you admit of an eternal ‘universal’ (commonalty),—then our view of the matter becomes established. But even so, there cannot be a dual form. as a matter of fact, the ‘connection’ is only a kind of potency; and of this no diversity is perceived; it is always inferred from its effects, and as such, it follows the diversity in the effects.—In fact the potency is always presumed on the basis of the fact of something well-known not being otherwise explicable; and when this purpose (of explaining) has been accomplished by the presumption of one potency, there can be no justification for assuming several—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhakṣepaparihāra, 22-29]

There is no such contradiction between being known and being not known; because knowledge subsists in the cognisant person; and as personalities vary, there is no incompatibility; hence the absence of knowledge, as residing in one person, does not become excluded (by the presence of knowledge, in another person).—[Ślokavārtika-samhandhākṣepaparihāra, 33-35]

And yet there is no reliable person (known, who could be the author of the Veda);—the Veda therefore must be regarded as unreliable’.”—[see Ślokavārtika—on sentence, 108-110]

tasmāt ālokavat vede sarva laukika cakṣuṣi | ulūka vat pratīghātaḥ kila anyeṣām adharma jaḥ || 	Thus, like light, the Veda being the ‘eye’ for all men,—the hostility that arises against it among some people, is like the hostility of the owl (to light),—and is the effect of their demerit” 
tasmāt ālokavat vede sarva laukika cakṣuṣi | ulūka vat pratīghātaḥ kila anyeṣām adharma jaḥ || 	Thus, like light, the Veda being the ‘eye’ for all men,—the hostility that arises against it among some people, is like the hostility of the owl (to light),—and is the effect of their demerit” 
sarvam etat dvijātīnām mithyā māna vijṛmbhitam | ghuṇa akṣara vat āpannam sūktam na eṣām hi kiñcana || 	All this is the product of the false pride of the twice-born people. There is no truth in this, even by the slightest change 
sarvam etat dvijātīnām mithyā māna vijṛmbhitam | ghuṇa akṣara vat āpannam sūktam na eṣām hi kiñcana || 	All this is the product of the false pride of the twice-born people. There is no truth in this, even by the slightest change 
kartari asati api hi eṣā na eva satya artha tām vrajet | tad hetu guṇa vaikalyāt doṣa abhāve mṛṣā artha vat || 	Even though there is no author, the Veda cannot be regarded as saying what is true;—because it is devoid of those excellences in its source which would make it truthful;—just as in the absence of defects, the word is not regarded as false, 
guṇāḥ santi na santi iti pauruṣeyeṣu śaṅkyate | ānarthakyam atas prāptam guṇa āśaṅkā eva nā asti naḥ || 	It is only in the case of the works of persons that the question arises as to whether the excellences are there or not. hence there is no need for such an enquiry in the case in question; and we have not the slightest idea of there being any excellence at all 
atas satya tva mithyā tva hetūnām na ca saṃśrayāt | prajñā dayā akṛpā ādīnām abhāvāt na asti tad dvayam || 	Thus, inasmuch as the causes of truthfulness and falsity,—in the share (a) of wisdom and mercy and (b) of absence of mercy, etc.,—are not there, the said two qualities cannot belong to the Veda 
ānarthyakyam atas prāptam ṣaṣ apūpa ādi vākyavat | arthāḥ ced sampratīyante kriyā kāraka yoginaḥ || eṣā syāt puruṣa ākhyānāt urvaśī carita ādi vat | pratipattiḥ a tādarthye api asya prakṛtitaḥ tava || 	Thus the Veda is reduced to futility,—like such sentences as ‘six cakes’.—If it be argued that “meanings are actually comprehended (from Vedic sentences), in respect of actions and active agents”,—[the answer is that] there may be such comprehension in cases where there are explanations supplied by men,—as in the case of the doings of Urvaśī,—even though the words (of the Veda) by themselves do not really convey any such meaning at all,—as held by you 
doṣa abhāve api satya tvam na siddhyati anya bhāvataḥ  | ānarthakya ākhyam api asti tasmāt rāśi antaram param || 	Even if there be no defects, truthfulness does not become proved simply because the other alternative must be accepted; because there is a third alternative possible, that of ‘meaninglessness’

tatas paramataḥ jñāna janma śakti parikṣayāt | na nityaḥ syāt ayam vedaḥ śaktau vā dhīḥ punar bhavet || atha api sahakārīṇi vyākhyā ādīni vyapekṣate | teṣām ca krama sadbhāvāt tat vijñānam kramīṣyate || na evam tasya hi śaktasya vyapekṣā kīdṛśī bhavet | tad yogāt sa samarthaḥ ced nitya tā āśā iha kā tava || 	After that the Veda’s capacity to bring about cognitions would cease; consequently the Veda could not be eternal. if the said capacity continues to exist, then the same cognitions should appear again 2362) It might be said that—“the Veda stands in need of explanations, etc., and as these explanations appear in succession, the cognitions (brought about by the Veda) are held to be successive also.” It cannot be so; when it is efficient (and has the capacity)—what sort of ‘dependence’ could there be? If it is efficient because of the presence of that on which it is dependent,—what hope, then, can you have of its being eternal? 
prāk aśaktaḥ samarthaḥ ca yadi taiḥ kriyate punar | prasaktaḥ pauruṣeyaḥ ayam jñāna aṅgam hi nara āśrayāt || 	If it was previously inefficient, and is made efficient by the explanations,—then it becomes a source of knowledge through the help of personalities, and hence the work of a person 
nahi tāvat sthitaḥ api eṣa jñānam vedaḥ karoti naḥ | yāvat na puruṣaiḥ eva dīpa bhūtaiḥ prakāśitaḥ  || tatas ca apauruṣeya tvam bhūta artha jñāna kāraṇam | na kalpyam jñānam etat hi puṃvyākhyānāt pravarttate || satī api eṣā nirarthā atas vedasya apauruṣeya tā | yat iṣṭam phalam asyāḥ hi jñānam tatpuruṣa āśritam 	The Veda, as it stands, provides no knowledge to us, until it is illuminated (explained) by persons who act as lamps. Consequently there is no reason for the assumption that what brings about the knowledge of things is something which is not the work of a person; because the knowledge in question does proceed from the explanations provided by persons. Thus the character of not being the work of a person, even though it may be present in the veda, is of no use; because the only result produced by the Veda—i.e. knowledge—is dependent upon persons 
śaktaḥ ced sarvadā eva ayam tat kim anyat apekṣate | śakta eka hetu bhāve tu jñānam syāt eva tena vaḥ || 	If the Veda is always efficient (to produce knowledge), then why should it require anything else? The required knowledge would be forthcoming for you from the presence of that single efficient cause 
svatantrāḥ puruṣāḥ ca iha vede vyākhyām yathāruci  | kurvāṇāḥ pratibaddhum te śakyante nā eva kenacid  || moha māna ādibhiḥ doṣaiḥ atas amī viplutāḥ śruteḥ  | viparītām api vyākhyām kuryuḥ iti abhiśaṅkyate  || na ca antīndriya dṛś teṣām iṣṭaḥ ekaḥ api mānavaḥ  | svarga yāga ādi sambandha jñānam na eva hi acodanam  || yasmāt atīndriya arthānām draṣṭā sākṣāt na ca asti vaḥ  | vacanena hi nityena yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati 	Persons, being free agents, proceeding to explain the Veda, according to their whims, could never be checked by any one. consequently, being beset with such defects as delusion, vanity, etc., they might provide wrong explanations of the Veda.—there is room for such a suspicion 2370-2371) The other party do not admit any person capable of perceiving supersensuous things;—and the knowledge of the connection between heaven and sacrificial performance can not be obtained except from the (Vedic) injunction; because for you, there is no person who is capable of directly perceiving supersensuous things; as whoever has any knowledge of these has it only through the eternal words 
vedaḥ naram nirāśaṃsaḥ brūte artham na sadā svatas  | andhātta yaṣṭi tulyām tu puṃvyākhyām samapekṣate || 	The Veda, by itself, without any support, cannot always make known its own meaning; in fact, it stands in need of explanations by persons,—such explanations being like the stick held by the blind man 
sa tayā kṛṣyamāṇaḥ ca kuvartmani api sampatet | tatas na ālokavat vedaḥ cakṣuḥ bhūtaḥ ca yujyate || 	When pulled up by the explanations, the Veda might fall into the wrong path; and in that case, it would not be right to regard the Veda as the ‘eye’ (illuminating things) like the light 
svatantrasya ca vijñāna janaka tve sati sphuṭam | prāmāṇyam api na eva asya sambhāvyam puruṣa īkṣaṇāt || 	Even though by itself, the Veda may be able to bring about cognitions,—yet its validity (reliability) cannot be quite clear; as it is dependent upon personalities 
yathārtha bodha hetu tvāt prāmāṇyam hi avakalpate | puṃvyākhyā apekṣaṇe ca asya na sādhuḥ māna kalpanā || 	The validity of a means of cognition is accepted on the ground of its bringing about cognitions in accordance with the real state of things. If then, the Veda depends upon explanations provided by men, the assumption of its validity (reliability) cannot be right 
ittham māne asthite vede śiṣya ācārya paramparā | anādiḥ kalpyamānā api na adoṣa tvāya yujyate || 	Thus, the Veda not having been proved to be valid, any beginningless line of pupils and teachers, even though assumed, cannot make it faultless 
yasmāt ekaḥ api tad madhye na eva atīndriya dṛś mataḥ  | anādiḥ kalpitā api eṣā tasmāt andha paramparā || andhena andhaḥ samākṛṣṭaḥ samyak vartma prapadyate | dhruvam na eva tathā api asyāḥ viphalā anādi kalpanā || 	2379) When a blind man is led by another blind man, he is not sure to get at the right path; hence the assumption of the beginninglessness of the line (of pupils and teachers) is entirely futile 
paratas veda tattva jñāḥ manu vyāsa ādayaḥ api ca | taiḥ eva āracitaḥ na ayam arthaḥ iti atra na pramā || 	As a matter of fact, there is no means of knowing for certain that this thing (the Veda and its meaning) has not been made (composed) by such later beings as Manu, Vyāsa and others 
satya artha nitya sambandha mātrāt prāmāṇyam astu vā | atīndriyam tu tam yogam na eva kaścid vyavasyati || atīndriyāḥ yatas te arthāḥ tad sthaḥ yogaḥ api atīndriyaḥ  | an atyakṣa dṛśaḥ sarve narāḥ ca ete svatas sadā || 	The validity and reliability of the Veda may be due merely to eternal connection expressive of true things; even so, there is no one who ever perceives that connection, which is beyond the senses. All that is expressed by the words (of the Veda) is supersensuous; hence its connection also must be supersensuous; while all human beings by themselves are incapable of seeing things beyond the reach of the senses 
ayam mama artha sambandhaḥ iti āha ca na sā śrutiḥ | nara klṛptaḥ artha yogaḥ tu pauruṣeyāt na bhidyate || 	The Veda certainly does not say—‘such and such is my connection with the meaning’; as regards the ‘connection of the meaning’ that would be fixed by men, and would not differ from being ‘the work of man’ 
tat yathā pauruṣeyasya śaṅkyate viparīta tā | naraiḥ utprekṣitasya api sā śaṅkyā eva na kim bhavet || 	Just as it is suspected that what the word of man says may be untrue,—in the same way, may it not be suspected that the meaning imagined by man may be wrong? 
māne sthite api vede atas śiṣya ācārya paramparā | anādiḥ kalpitā api eṣā saṃjātā andha paramparā || nanu āreka ādi nirmuktā svarga ādau jāyate matiḥ  | agnihotra ādi vacasaḥ niṣkampa adhyakṣa buddhi vat || na avalambeta tām kurvan katham vedaḥ pramāṇa tām  | na hi atas vacanāt artham saṃdigdham vetti kaścana || 	Even if the Veda is a reliable source of knowledge, the beginningless ‘line of pupils and teachers’ that has been assumed becomes like a ‘line of blind persons’ 2386) “The cognition that arises in regard to heaven and such things, from the Vedic sentences speaking of the agnihotra, etc. is found to be free from doubt and uncertainty,—just like the firm conviction that proceeds from sense-perception. Why then should the Veda, bringing about such cognition not be regarded as reliable? It is for this reason that the idea that one derives from the words of the Veda is never doubtful and uncertain.” 
na evam saṃśaya saṃjāteḥ viparīta anya vākya vat | prekṣāvantaḥ hi na eteṣām bhedam paśyanti kañcana || na atīndriye hi yujyete sat asat tā viniścayau | niścayaḥ veda vākyāt ced anyāt ṛc na kim anyatas || 	It is not so; because uncertainty does arise (in the case of the vedic sentence), just in the same way as in the case of another assertion to the contrary; and intelligent people do not perceive any difference between the two cases. In fact, in regard to things beyond the senses, there can be no certainty regarding their existence or non-existence.—If it be urged that—“this certainty does arise from the Vedic sentence”,—then, (the answer is)—why cannot there be certainty regarding the contrary of that, from another sentence? 
śrotriyāṇām tu niṣkampā buddhiḥ eṣā upajāyate | śraddhā vivaśa buddhīnām sā anyeṣām anyatas samā || tathā hi saugata ādīnām dhīra kampā upajāyate | apāyāt uḥkha sambhūtiḥ yāgāt prāṇi vadha anvitāt || asyāḥ ca na dhiyaḥ kācid bādhā samprati dṛśyate | kvacid kadācid śaṅkyā ced veda vākye api sā samā || 	That Vedic scholars derive unshakable notions from the Veda is due to their minds being influenced by faith; and this is equally present in other people’s minds, in respect of other assertions, for example, quite as unshakable notions are derived by the Buddhists regarding trouble and suffering resulting from sacrifices which involve the killing of animals. Of this latter notion we do not find any sublation till now. If it be said that “there may be sublation of it at some future time and place”,—the same is equally possible in the case of the Vedic sentence also 
nara icchā adhīna saṅketa nirapekṣaḥ yadi svayam  | vedaḥ prakāśayet svārtham pramāṇam yujyate tadā || tadā hi moha māna ādi doṣa upapluta buddhibhiḥ  | anyathā ākhyāyamānaḥ hipi nijam artham na muñcati || yasmāt tad viṣayām eva dhiyam utpādayati aram | na tu iṣṭam puruṣaiḥ artham aparam dyotayati ayam  || nara icchāyāḥ tu apekṣāyām pauruṣeyāt na bhidyate | dyotanam hi tad āyattam viparyastā api sā bhavet || 	If the Veda expressed its meaning by itself independently of conventions made by the whims of men,—then it might be valid and reliable. As, in that case, it would not abandon its meaning, even when explained otherwise by men with minds perverted by delusion, vanity and other defects;—and it would directly bring about the cognition of that meaning alone, and not express any meaning that may be desired by men.—If however, it depends upon the whims of men, then it does not differ from the common assertions of men; as in that case the expressing of meaning would be dependent upon men, and it is quite possible that it may be wrong 
api ca a pauruṣeyasya yathā prākṛtam iṣyate  | satya artha tvam asatya tvam evam āśaṅkyate na kim || svatas satya artha bodhasya hetu tvāt satya tā asya hi | evam mithyā tva bodhe api hetu tvam śaṅkyate svatas || 	It is said that the Veda, not being the work of an author, has the inherent capacity of asserting what is true;—but why cannot it be suspected that what it says is not true? Just as its truthfulness is deduced from the fact that by itself, it brings about the cognition of what is true,—in the same manner it might be suspected that by itself it brings about the cognition of what is not true 
kiṃca veda pramāṇa tve nirbandhaḥ yadi vaḥ dhruvam | nirdoṣa kartṛka tva ādau tadā yatnaḥ vidhīyatām  || nirdoṣeṇa hi kartrā ayam kṛtaḥ adoṣaiḥ prakāśakaiḥ  | dyotamānaḥ ca loke asmin bhūta artha jñāna sādhanaḥ || 	Further, if you are really eager to regard the Veda as valid and reliable, then try and prove that it is the work of a person free from defects and so forth. If it is composed by a faultless author and is expounded in the world by faultless expounders, it certainly can be the means of obtaining the cognition of the real truth regarding things 
prajñā kṛpā ādi yuktānām tathā hi su viniścitāḥ  | pauruṣeyyaḥ api sat vācaḥ yathārtha jñāna hetavaḥ || 	The well-defined and excellent words of persons full of wisdom and compassion, even though emanating from personalities, are actually the means of true cognitions 
na narākṛtam iti eva yathārtha jñāna kāri tu | dṛṣṭā hi dāva vahni ādeḥ mithyājñāne api hetu tā || 	As a matter of fact, the Veda cannot be regarded as a source of right cognition, simply because it is not the work of man. because it has been found that such things as forest-fire and the like (which are not the work of man) are the source of false cognitions 
raktam nīla sarojam hi vahni āloke sati iṣyate | vahni ādiḥ kṛtaka tvāt ced na hetuḥ upapadyate || 	In the glare of fire, the blue lotus appears as red.—if it is said that—“in this case the fire is the cause of the wrong cognition, and is a product (not eternal)”—[Then, the answer is as in the following text] 
kim vaikṛtaka tā arthānām mithyājñāna nibandhanam | evam hi na eva dhūmaḥ agneḥ yathāvat dyotakam bhavet || 	Does the ‘character of being a product’ make things the source of wrong cognitions? In that case, smoke would not be the correct indicator of fire 
evam ca apauruṣeyaḥ api samyak jñāne nibandhanam | vedaḥ santiṣṭhate na eva tat vṛthak eva asya kalpanā || 	Thus, even though not the work of a person, the Veda cannot be the source of right cognition; hence the assumption of it is entirely futile 
tatas ca apauruṣeya tva vyakti nitya tva sādhanam | nitya śabda artha yogaḥ ca vyarthaḥ eva upavarṇitaḥ || tasmin sati api na eva asya yathārtha jñāna hetu tā | upagamyate iti uktam vyāsataḥ samanantaram || tena eva etad pratikṣepe na asmākam guruḥ ādaraḥ | aprastuta upayogasya kaḥ hi kuryāt niṣedhanam || 	From all this it follows that the reasons in support of (1) the Veda not being the work of a person, (2) of there being only a ‘manifestation’ of it, and (3) of its being eternal,—as also (4) of the eternal connection between the words and its meaning,—have all been set forth uselessly. Because, even if the Veda has all this character, it cannot be accepted to be the source of true knowledge; as has been just stated in detail. Hence we are not paying much attention to the refutation of this idea (of the Veda not being the work of a person). Who would ever care to refute what has no bearing upon the matter under consideration? 
yathārtha jñāna hetu tvam śruteḥ prakṛtam atra hi | na narākaraṇe api etat siddhyati iti ca sādhitam || āhopuruṣikā yā atra saṃkṣiptam kiṃcid ucyate | visaranti yathā anena gatayaḥ sūkṣma dhī dṛśām || 	The question that is being considered now is the idea of the Veda being the source of right knowledge; and it has been proved that it cannot be so, even if it be not the work of a person.—What little is said in this connection (by the other party) in sheer vanity,—all that vanishes in this same way, for all men of keen intellectual vision 
pramāṇānām nivṛttyā api na prameyam nivarttate | yasmāt vyāpaka hetu tvam teṣām tatra na vidyate || 	The absence of the means of cognition does not necessarily mean the absence of the object of cognition; because the latter are not causes with which the former is invariably concomitant 
tad pañcabhiḥ agamyaḥ api na abhāvena eva u asya ava gamyate | karttā śruteḥ avijñāta kartṛka ākhyāyikā ādi vat || 	Thus, even though not cognisable by the five means of cognition, the author of the Veda is not amenable to ‘non-apprehension’ (negation) alone;—he being just like the author of the story-book whose author is not known 
tad pañcabhiḥ agamyaḥ api na abhāvena eva u asya ava gamyate | karttā śruteḥ avijñāta kartṛka ākhyāyikā ādi vat || 	If the author of these story-books is inferred from the fact of their being expressive of distinctly clear meanings,—then why cannot the same be done in regard to the Veda also? 
sarva sattvaiḥ agamya tvam saṃdigdham tu kadācana  | kenacid kaḥ api mānena vetti iti api hi śaṅkyate || yena yat na tribhuvana antasthāḥ sarve prāṇabhṛtaḥ sphuṭam  | sarva ātmanā aparicchinnāḥ su niścetum imam kṣamāḥ || svayam tu agamyamāna tvam vyabhicāri tathā hi te | puruṣa antara saṃkalpaiḥ tad abhāvaḥ na niścitaḥ || 	As regards his being not cognised by all beings,—that is always doubtful; as it is possible that at some time by some means of cognition, he might become cognised by some one. Because that he is so uncognisable cannot be clearly ascertained by all living beings of all the three worlds coming together without exception.—As regards his being not cognised by the Mīmāṃsaka himself, it is clearly ‘inconclusive’, because that does not prove with certainty that there is no cognition by other persons 
adhyetāraḥ ca vedānām karttāraḥ adhyakṣataḥ matāḥ  | nahi te vyañjakāḥ yuktāḥ nityānām vyakti asambhavāt || 	It is through perception that the readers of the Veda are recognised as the ‘makers’. It cannot be right to regard them as ‘manifesters’; because the ‘manifestation’ of eternal things is impossible 
upalabhya svabhāvānām tad vyāpāre samudbhavaḥ | teṣām prāk api sadbhāve upalabdhiḥ prasajyate || 	The Vedas being perceptible in their character, there is appearance of them when there is operation of the ‘manifester’: if they existed even before that operation, then they should be perceptible at that time also 
tad kārya vyavahāra ādi yogyaḥ vedaḥ avasīyate | tad vyāpāre asya sadbhāvāt bīja ādeḥ aṅkura ādi vat || 	The Veda is recognised as capable of being, treated as the effect produced by the ‘manifester’,—because it appears only when this latter is present;—like the sprout in the presence of the seed 
vyañjana krama rūpa tvāt nāṭaka ākhyāyikā ādi vat | vedānām pauruṣeya tvam anumā api avagacchati || 	Because they appear in the sequential form in which they become manifested,—like dramas and stories,—the Vedas must be the work of an author; thus the author is cognised by means of inference also

āgamasya upamāyāḥ ca sārtha āpatteḥ pramāṇa tā  | niṣiddhā prāk tatas tāsām upanyāsaḥ na yujyate || 	It has been shown that ‘verbal authority’, ‘analogy’ and ‘presumption’ cannot be the means of bight cognition;—hence it cannot be right to bring these forward

bhāva pakṣa prasiddhi artham ucyate yat ca sādhanam | nirākṛte api te tasmin ābhāvaḥ siddhyati svayam || tadbhāva sādhane api aste na syāt tadbhāva niścayaḥ | tadbhāva vinivṛtteḥ tu tanmātrāt na asti niścayaḥ || nivṛttau api mānānām artha abhāva aprasiddhitaḥ | tena etāvat bhavet na asti pakṣa siddhiḥ dvayoḥ api 	If certain proofs are adduced in support of the view that there is an author of the Vedas,—if these proofs are refuted, it does not necessarily follow that there is no such author. In fact on the refutation of the proof of his existence, what follows is that there is no certainty regarding his existence; similarly the mere setting aside of the idea of his existence is not enough to bring about any certainty at all.—As a matter of fact, even on the cessation of the means of cognition, there is no certainty regarding the nonexistence of the thing concerned; hence all that it can prove is that there is no certainty regarding either of the two views 
na amūrta tvāt yathā śabdaḥ sukha ādau vyabhicārataḥ | iti ukte api na śabdasya vināśi tvam prasiddhyati || 	For instance, when on the ground of ‘incorporeality’, the other party seeks to prove the eternality (of word-sounds),—and against this it is pointed out that, in view of pleasure, which also is ‘incorporeal’ (and yet not-eternal), the said reason is ‘inconclusive’,—it does not necessarily follow (from this counterargument) that the word-sound is perishable 
tad pūrva aparayoḥ koṭyoḥ yat uktam sādhanam paraiḥ | tad nirākaraṇe api ete akṛtārthāḥ veda vādinaḥ || 	Thus then, when a proof has been adduced in support of the two ends of the Veda,—by the refutation of that proof, the upholders of the Veda do not have their purpose accomplished 
akṛta tva avināśābhyām nitya tvam ced vivakṣitam  | niṣedha mātra rūpābhyām nirupākhye api tad samam || atas gagana rājī iva nitya tā asti na vāstavī  | yathā tathā eva vede api tad prāmāṇyam na siddhyati  || 	If ‘eternality’ is what is meant by being not produced and being not destroyed,—then, inasmuch as both would be of the nature of mere negation,—the same may be said regarding the non-entity also. consequently, just as the eternality of the ‘sky-lotus’ is not real, in the same way the reliability of the Veda also does not become established 
kṛtaka tva vināśi tva niṣedhaḥ api na siddhyati | sādhane aste iti proktam tat nitya tvam na siddhyati || 	Even the denial of the characters of being produced and being destroyed cannot be admitted; as it has been said that ‘the proof is set aside’. Hence eternality does not become established

viniścita trirūpam ca sādhanam yat prakāśitam | niṣedhaḥ śakyate tasya tvad pitrā api na jātucit || 	The reason that has been adduced by us in its three-fold form,—cannot be refuted even by your father

The inference based upon well-recognised invariable concomitance, as explained before, is what sets aside the soul 
tasyāḥ vastu nibaddhāyāḥ kaḥ bādhām maṃsyate jaḍaḥ | śabda mātreṇa tucchena tad bhāvinyā athavā dhiyā || 	When the inference is firmly based upon the nature of things—who would be the stupid person who would discard it on the strength of mere words,—or by the cognition born of such words? 
puṃvākyāt api vijñānam yat pravṛttam atīndriye | tasya api adhyakṣa tulya tvam kasmāt abhimatam na vaḥ || 	When a cognition proceeds from the words of a human-being, in regard to something beyond the senses,—why do you not regard it to be as reliable as that derived from sense-perception?

mama apramāṇam iti evam śabdaḥ artham bodhayan api | nāraḥ asau dveṣa mātreṇa śakyaḥ vaktum na sādhunā || 	While the word (human) is clearly bringing about the cognition of things, no right-minded person should say, through sheer malice, that it is human (and hence unreliable) 
iti atyakṣeṣu sarvaḥ api śabdaḥ tulya balābalaḥ | ekatra eva anurāgaḥ ayam tat vaḥ kena iha hetunā || 	Thus in the matter of super-sensuous things, all words are of equal strength and weakness; why then should you be in love with only one kind of them? 
anantara uditam nyāyam veda aprāmāṇya kāraṇam | prājñāḥ jalpanti tena amī bhaveyuḥ satya vādinaḥ || 	The principle just explained forms the reason why it is asserted by the wise that the Veda cannot be regarded as a means of right cognition. And in this they say what is perfectly true 
mithyā anurāga saṃjāta veda adhyāna jaḍīkṛtaiḥ  | mithyā tva hetuḥ ajñātaḥ iti citram na kiṃcana || na hi mātṛ vivāha ādau doṣaḥ kaścid apīkṣyate | pārasīka ādibhiḥ dhūrtaiḥ tad ācāra paraiḥ sadā || 	There is nothing strange in the fact that people, whose intelligence has been dulled by the constant contemplation of the Veda, prompted by false attachment, have failed to detect the sources of falsity (in the Veda). The Pārasīka people who are addicted to the practice do not perceive anything wrong in the remarriage of their mothers 
pratyakṣa pratyabhijñā tu prāk eva vinivāritā | bhrānteḥ sa kalpana tvāt ca na atas nitya tva niścayaḥ || 	The idea of ‘recognition being of the nature of perception’ has been already discarded; and as wrong cognition is always associated with ‘conceptual content’, there can be no certainty regarding eternality

On this ground alone, all this would be one and the same. Hence there can be no manifester, and no manifested. Because when the thing is one and indivisible, that fact precludes all notions of diversity.—Further, there can be no determination, based upon recognition, that ‘these words are human’ and ‘those others are not uttered by men 
kecid eka kramāḥ eva vyañjaka krama saṃsthiteḥ | iṣṭāḥ apauruṣeyāḥ te niyata krama yoginaḥ || 	Some words are found always in one and the same order of sequence,—the order of the manifested being fixed; these words are held to be not-human, appearing, as they do, always in the same fixed order of sequence.” 
nanu ayam pauruṣaḥ dharmaḥ tālu ādi vyañjaka kramaḥ | tasmāt kadācid tasya api sambhāvyeta viparyayaḥ || 	As a matter of fact, the order of sequence in the manifesting agencies, palate and other speech-centres—is something that appertains to men; hence it is possible that it may be otherwise

That element wherein there appears the notion of difference,—like slow, fast and so forth,—in regard to these there can be no recognition...... (?) 
śabda eka tva prasiddhi artham prayukteṣu tu hetuṣu | vijātīya avirodhi tvāt pratibandhaḥ na siddhyati || 	In the reasons that have been put forward in proof of the idea of the one-ness of the word,—there is no invariable concomitance possible; because they are not incompatible with the contrary 
dhūma sāmānya bhāgaḥ api na eva  siddha sādhanam || 	As regards the ‘universal aspect of smoke’...... [lacuna in: the text]..... your argument is ‘superfluous’

hyastana ādyatanāḥ sarve go śabda pratyayāḥ ime | na eka arthāḥ krama sambhūte rūpa gandha ādi buddhi vat || 	All these cognitions of the ‘cow-word’, which appeared yesterday and to-day, cannot all envisage the same object,—like the successively appearing cognitions of colour and odour, etc 
anyathā sarva buddhīnām eka ālambana tā bhavet | krama bhāva virodhaḥ ca śakta kāraṇa sannidheḥ || 	If it were not so, then all cognitions would have one and the same object; there would be incongruity also as regards their appearing in succession, when their efficient cause is there all the time

What the common man thinks is that there is repeated use of one and the same word.—The relationship also is possible when subsisting in several individuals. Consequently in all cases, there is a multiplicity of words, but they come to be conceived of as one 
vastutas tu na sambandhaḥ śabdasya arthena vidyate | bhedāt tasmāt anutpatteḥ bhrāntaiḥ āropitaḥ tatas || tathā hi vistareṇa eṣā prāk eva pratipāditā  | śabda artha saṃsthitiḥ sarvā viplutā vyāpti asambhavāt || 	In reality, there can be no relationship between the word and its meaning; (a) because there is difference between them,—and (b) because one is not born from the other. The relationship has only been imposed by people under an illusion.—That this is so has been explained in detail already. In fact, the whole position of the word and its meaning is highly complicated; as there is no invariable concomitance between them 
go tvam nityam apāstam ca sambandhaḥ api ca kalpitaḥ | aṇu ākāśa ādi api ca kṣiptam hetūdāharaṇe na tat || 	Any such eternal universal as ‘cow’ has been already rejected; the relationship also is purely imaginary; the ‘ākāśa’ and the ‘atom’ also have been discarded. hence neither the probans nor the corroborative instance is sound

In the case of the jar and other things also, there is no cause for their destruction, which can be clearly pointed out as ‘this is what will destroy it’; how, then, can any such cause be pointed out in the case of the word? 
viplave pratyabhijñāyāḥ purastāt upapāditaḥ  | deśa kāla prayoktṝṇām bhedāt dharmaḥ vibhidyate || ṣaḍja ṛṣabha gāndhāra pañcama ādi prabhedataḥ | pratyakṣataḥ hi vijñātā gavyaktiḥ aparā sphuṭā  || na ca vyañjaka bhedena yuktā eṣā bheda saṃsthitiḥ | vyaktiḥ nityeṣu na asti iti purastāt abhidhāsyate || 	That there is mistake in recognitions has already been explained before.—The ‘property’ varies with the variations of place, time and persons using (the word); and the variations appear in the shape of the various notes, ṣaḍja, ṛṣabha, gāndhāra, pañcama and so forth;—the cogniser also is perceived directly; the individual letter ‘ga’ is also clearly distinct.—All this diversity cannot be regarded as due to the diversity in the ‘manifester’; that there can be no ‘manifestation’ in the case of eternal things is going to be explained later on 
gakāra vyatiriktam ca sāmānyam ga tvam iṣyate | vāstavam na prayoge atas durvārā siddha sādhya tā || 	The universal ‘ga’ is not held to be something real, distinct from the letter ‘ga’; hence the charge of ‘futility’ is irresistible, as against the Mīmāṃsaka’s reasoning 
anya apoha ātmakasya api na ga tvasya samāśrayaḥ | ittham eva iti ced na evam āśraya asiddha tā āptitaḥ || a gakāra parāvṛtta ga varṇa abhāvataḥ bhavet | gānya buddhi anirūpya tvam kasya dharmaḥ hi dharmiṇaḥ || 	If it be urged that what is sought to be proved (by the mīmāṃsaka’s argument) is that it is not the substratum of the universal ‘ga’, which is of the nature of the ‘exclusion of others’,—that cannot be right; as that will involve the fallacy of the basis of the reason being ‘inadmissible’.—Inasmuch as the letter ‘ga’ is nothing apart from ‘the exclusion of the non-ga’, to which object would the character of ‘being not apprehended by any cognition other than that of ga’ belong? 
vāstavī ca anumā sarvā dvaya siddham apekṣate | dṛṣṭānta ādi tatas tena dṛṣṭāntaḥ dharmya siddhi bhāj || 	Every right inference requires such corroborative instance, etc, as are admitted by both parties. in the case of the inference in question however, the objective basis (of the reason) is not so admitted 
sarvaḥ ca ayam prayatnaḥ te gakāra eka tva siddhaye | tatra pratyakṣa bādhā ca durnivāra uditā tava || 	All, this attempt of yours is for the purpose of proving the oneness of the letter ‘ga’; and this is clearly and undeniably annulled by perception, as already explained to you 
hyastana ādyatana ādyāḥ ca ga varṇa pratyayāḥ ime | krama bhāvena na eka arthāḥ rasa rūpa ādi buddhi vat || atas na dvaya siddhaḥ ayam ekaḥ varṇaḥ sadā sthitaḥ  | adoṣam apoha kalpitasya eva nitya tvam tu asya kalpitam || 	All these cognitions of the letter ‘ga’ which appeared yesterday and today, etc. appearing in succession, cannot envisage one and the same thing,—like the cognitions of taste, colour, etc.—Thus the ‘one letter’ is not something ‘admitted by both parties hence the ‘eternality’ that has been assumed appertains to the postulated ‘exclusion of others’ 
śabda upalambha velāyām karṇa paryanta vartinaḥ | na vāyavaḥ avagamyante śrotra saṃskāra kāriṇaḥ || nādena saṃskṛtāt śrotrāt yadā śabdaḥ pratīyate | tad upaśleṣataḥ tasya bodhaḥ adhyakṣeṇa bādhyate || 	At the time that the word-sound is heard, there is no perception of the air-currents reaching the ear and embellishing the auditory organ. when the sound is cognised through the ear as embellished by the pitch,—there is idea of the pitch as related to that sound; and this idea is clearly annulled by direct perception 
tikta pīta ādi rūpeṇa pravṛttam madhura ādiṣu | jñānam nirviṣayam yadvat śabda jñānam yathā bhavet || 	Just as the notion of ‘bitterness’ with regard to what is ‘sweet’, and of ‘yellow’ with regard to what is ‘white’, is without an objective basis,—of the same kind would the notion of the word-sound also be 
druta madhya ādi bhedāt hi na anyaḥ śabdaḥ avabhāsate | a tadrūpe ca tādrūpya jñānam na aviṣayam katham || 	Under the variations of ‘fast’, ‘middling’ and ‘slow’,—the word-sound itself does not appear as different. under the circumstances, when the cognition envisages something in a form that does not belong to it,—why should not this cognition be objectless? 
anyathā ca tam eva artham vetti iti vyāhatam vacaḥ | anya ākārasya saṃvittau sa hi arthaḥ viditaḥ katham || nirākāre hi vijñāne bāhya ākāraḥ sa te dhruvam | bāhyaḥ ca na tadā ātmā iti kim asau vidyate tathā || sa ākāra jñāna pakṣe api bāhya ākāra anurūpataḥ  | jñāne narbhāsa saṃbhūtau arthaḥ viditaḥ ucyate  || iha bāhya anurūpeṇa na tu jñānam pravarttate  | tasmāt nirviṣayam sarvam bhrāntam cittam iti sthitam 	The assertion that ‘one cognises the one thing as otherwise’ involves self-contradiction; i.e. what is cognised is another form, then how can the same object be said to be cognised? under the view that cognition is formless, it would exist only in the external form; consequently, if what is cognised is external and yet not of the nature of the external thing,—then how is it that it exists? Even under the view that cognitions have forms, the cognition always appears in accordance with the external form; and then alone is the object said to be ‘cognised’.—in the case in question, however, the cognition does not appear in accordance with the external form.—Hence it follows that all this cognition, which is wrong, is entirely objectless 
śabdasya agrāhya tā evam syāt tasmin anupayogataḥ | tasya na evam rasa ādibhyaḥ viśeṣaḥ kaścana asti hi || 	It cannot be right that there should be a ‘manifester’,—specially for what is eternal,—in accordance with its embellishments (and modifications); consequently there cannot be diverse cognitions in regard to the word-sound 
eka vyāpi nabhaḥ pakṣe vibhāgaḥ na prakalpyate  | saṃskṛta āśrayam anyat ca iti ekam eva hi tat nabhaḥ || eka vyoma ātmakam śrotram na asti asaṃskṛta śaṣkuli | atas adhiṣṭhāna bhedena saṃskāra niyamaḥ asthitaḥ  || tena ekasmin adhiṣṭhāne labdha saṃskāram indriyam  | bodhakam sarva deśeṣu vijñāna utpattiḥ iṣyatām  || puṃsām deha pradeśeṣu vijñāna utpattiḥ iṣyatām  | kintu pradhāna vaideśyam eka tvāt nabhasaḥ na te  || niṣpradeśaḥ 	Under the view that ākāśa is one and all-pervading, there can be no such division as that the one is the substratum of the embellished organ and the other is not so; because ākāśa is one (and indivisible).—If the auditory organ consists of the one ākāśa, then it cannot have its tympanum ‘unembellished’. Consequently, any restriction in the embellishment on the basis of the substratum cannot stand. Consequently, when the organ has secured the embellishment in one substratum, it should bring about the cognition in the bodies of all men;—according to those who declare the organ to be one only. You may hold that cognitions (sensations) appear in the various parts of the bodies of men; but according to you, there can be no diversity of place for the principal factor, in relation to ākāśa which is one only.—The other party might say—“according to us, the soul is without parts, indivisible, and it is in its entirety that it cognises things, and yet it actually apprehends if in the body only”;—but even with this, the view is open to objection: there would, in this case, be no such distinctions as that of the ‘deaf’ and the like, and for the same reason it would not be possible for one cognition not to be apprehended by another soul; as there is no difference between the two 
atyakta pūrvarūpam hi viśeṣa anudaye sati | katham nāma bhavet śrotram abhogyam aparasya te || nitya tvāt anapekṣa tvāt dharma adharbha avaśīkṛtam  | sadā eva ca nabhaḥ śrotram sarva ābhogyam prasajyate || dharma adharma upakāryam hi nabhaḥ na eva kadācana | nitya tvāt kārya tā bhāve ca asya kā iyam vaśīkriyā 	When it cannot abandon its previous form, and when no new features can appear in it,—why cannot the auditory organ come within range of the experience of another 
mantra auṣadha ādi śaktyā ca punar bhogyam katham bhavet | nitya tvāt na hi tat tebhyaḥ viśeṣam pratipadyate || 	How could the auditory organ come within the range of one’s experience, through the influence of charms and medicines, etc.? Being eternal, it cannot derive any peculiarities from these 
adhiṣṭhāne tu anitye api kṣaṇika anitya tā na ced | tadā ātma atiśaya ayogāt bādhirya ādi na yujyate || 	even though the substratum is not-eternal, its non-eternality would not be of the nature of momentariness”;—if this is urged, then (the answer is that), inasmuch as no additional properties could be produced in it, deafness, etc. would not be possible 
astu vā atiśayaḥ tasmin vyomni tu eṣa na vidyate | na ca adhiṣṭhāna sambandhāt nitya tvāt anapekṣaṇāt || atas tad dvārakaḥ api atra bādhirya ādi na yujyate | nabhasaḥ bhāgavat tve api nitya tāyām idam samam || 	Or, the additional property may be produced in the organ; but in no case could it exist in the ākāśa; nor could it be due to its connection with its receptacle; because it is eternal and independent. Hence, deafness, etc. could not come about through that either.—Even if ākāśa were with parts and divisible, the arguments would apply to it, on the ground of its eternality 
tatra eva bhavataḥ api evam svāmi tvāt apakarṣaṇam | na yuktam yadi tasya api kṣaṇika tvam samasti na  || kaḥ hi tasyāḥ samutpannaḥ paścāt atiśayaḥ yataḥ | svāmi tvāt apakṛṣṭaḥ asau na bhogam punar āpnuyāt || 	Even for you, this ‘removal from the ownership’ cannot be possible,—unless the ownership is momentary. what additional property has been produced in it, by virtue of which it is removed from the ownership and does not enjoy the same experience again? 
yadā ca saṃskṛtiḥ na evam śrotre śabde ca yujyate  | bheda abheda vikalpena saṃskāra anupapattitaḥ  || vyatireka hi saṃskāre śrotra śabdau na saṃskṛtau | syātām tābhyām ca sambandhaḥ saṃskārasya na kaścana  || vibhinnasya hi sambandhaḥ kārya kāraṇa tā bhavet  | tasyām ca sarvadā eva ayam bhavet hetoḥ sadā sthiteḥ  || anarthāntapakṣe api tadvat nityaḥ bhavet asau  | tat na śakya kriyaḥ tasmāt nityam jñānam prasajyate 	Thus then, there is no ‘embellishment’ possible, either in the auditory organ or in the word-sound; because it is not possible for the embellishment to be either different or non-different (from them). For instance, if the embellishment is something different from the auditory organ and the sound, then these two cannot be regarded as ‘embellished’; as these would have no relationship with the embellishment; because between two different things, the only relationship possible is the causal one; and if this relationship were there, then the embellishment would be there at all times, as its cause would be there at all times.—Even under the view that the embellishment is not something different,—it would be eternal, like the auditory organ and the sound; and hence it could not be produced by anything; consequently the cognition (due to the embellishment) would be everlasting.—Because all this is so, therefore any regulation or restriction of the capacity of the air-currents, etc. cannot be possible; and when what is to be accomplished is not present, the capacity to accomplish it can be of no use

tam hi śaktam aśaktam vā prakṛtyā eva ātmani sthitam | virodhī sahakārī vā kaḥ artham kṣapayitum kṣamaḥ || 	If the word-sound is, by its very nature, definitely capable or incapable,—what hostile or helpful force could set it aside?

sāmīpye api hi saṃskāraḥ kāraṇam parikalpyate | saṃskāraḥ sa samānaḥ ca teṣu dūra sthiteṣu api || viśiṣṭa saṃskṛteḥ janma dhvanibhyaḥ yadi gamyate | śabda utpattiḥ pratikṣeptum na śakyā kenacid tadā || viśiṣṭa saṃskṛtiḥ śabdāt sā hi na vyatirekiṇī | śabdasya ajñeya tā prāpteḥ tatas śabdaḥ api jāyate || 	Even in cases of proximity, the embellishment is supposed to be the cause (of the cognition); and this embellishment would be equally there for persons at a distance also 2568) If the idea is that particular embellishments are produced by articulations, then in that case, no one can deny the idea of the sound being produced. Because the particular embellishment is not something different from the word-sound; otherwise the word-sound would be incognisable. consequently the word-sound also should be regarded as produced 
saṃskṛtaḥ ca ekadā śabdaḥ tam ātmānam na jātucit  | jahāti anitya tā saṅgāt upalabhyeta ced sadā || 	Having become embellished once, if the word-sound does not abandon that (embellished) form, on account of its evanescent character,—then it should continue to be heard for all time 
dvaya saṃskāra pakṣe api satyam doṣa dvaye vacaḥ | yat na anyatara vaikalyam prāktanasya anuvṛttitaḥ || 	Even as regards the view that there is embellishment of both, the assertion that it is open to both sets of objections is quite true; because deficiency is not in one of the two only; as the previous one continues 
tathā hi saṃskṛtāḥ śrotra varṇāḥ yad vyañjakaiḥ purā | na naṣṭāḥ te cyuti prāpteḥ sarvaiḥ sarva śrutiḥ tatas || 	The auditory organ and the letter-sounds that have been previously embellished by the manifesters cannot become destroyed,—because if they did, they would be non-eternal; and consequently they would be heard at all times 
niyata śruti yogyau ced śrotra varṇau ca saṃskṛtau | na anya varṇa prapattṛṇām punar syāt śravaṇam tadā || 	If the embellished organ and letter-sounds were capable of hearing by a few limited persons, then there would be no hearing for other persons who would be going to hear the same letter-sounds 
tad varṇa nara vijñāna yogyau ced saṃskṛtau punar | tayoḥ eva anuvṛttau syāt tayoḥ api nanu śrutiḥ || 	If it be said that—“the organ and the letter-sound are embellished again, and are pit for the purpose of the cognition of that sound by other persons”,—then also there would be continuation of the same organ and sound, and hence of the hearing also of the same sound and by the same person 
vyāvṛttau anye eva amī śrotra varṇāḥ katham na te  | prāpnuvanti tatas teṣu nitya tā āśā anibandhanā  || 	If these other organ and letter-sound are distinct (from those embellished before),—then why does not the hope of these being eternal become entirely baseless? 
jala ādiṣu na ca ekaḥ ayam nānā ātmā savitā īkṣyate | pratibimba dhiyaḥ sarvāḥ yat nirālambanāḥ sthitāḥ  || 	In the water and other reflecting substances, it is not the same sun seen in various forms; because the cognitions that are there all pertain to the reflected images, and are entirely devoid of any objective basis

The reflected image that is seen is seen within the water; and yet the sun existing in the sky is not there in the water.—“How is it then that it appears as if in the water?”—It is through delusion, and hence it is that it is clearly devoid of an objective basis; because it has no connection with any object with that form.—If it is urged that “it is the same sun that is perceived otherwise”,—this would be another excellent assertion—the same and yet otherwise.—But in this way, every cognition would apprehend everything. It would be the cognition of the same sun only if it were seen exactly as it is; when however, it is actually perceived in another form, how could it be the perception of the same sun? Even if the cognition be with form, it can be regarded as apprehending an object only if it has a form that is not different from the object that is cognised 
pāramparya arpitam santam avāk vṛttyā avabuddhyatām | kintu ūrdhva vṛttim eka tve api avāk eva anumanyate || yathā eva avasthitaḥ hi arkaḥ tathā eva īkṣyeta yadi asau | avabuddhaḥ prakalpyeta na anyathā iti upapāditam || 	It may be that what is perceived by the downward rays is the sun shining above presented mediately; but even so, the perceiver regards the sun shining above as actually down in the water.—If the sun were actually perceived just as it stands, then it would be cognised as such, not otherwise. this has been already explained

aneka deśa vṛttau vā sati api pratibimbake | sthūla sūkṣma ādi vat bhedāt eka tvam na eva vidyate || 	Even if the reflected image exists in several places, it varies regarding its largeness, smallness and so forth; hence it cannot be one and the same

Even when speakers pronounce the letter ‘ga’ at one and the same time, the difference among them is clearly apprehended 
krameṇa tu prayoge asya pratyakṣeṇa na kevalam | bhedaḥ avagamyate kintu liṅgāt api dhiyām kramāt || 	When the letter is pronounced in succession, one after the other, the diversity is not only directly perceived, but also inferred through the inferential indicative in the shape of the fact of the cognitions appearing in succession

As a matter of fact, the word-sound is never apprehended as pervading over the whole ākāśa. Why then does the word-sound follow the diversity of place of the articulation? When manifested, it would appear by itself, like the jar and other things. All this about the cause has been said only by way of an elaboration of our argument. In reality the inefficiency of the manifesters has already been proved on the basis of the impossibility of manifestation.—As regards the directly perceptional notion that ‘this is the same word-sound’,—that has been already discarded; and it stands unrefuted that appearing in diverse places, the word-sound must be diverse 
paryāyeṇa ca yaḥ kaścid bhinna deśāt vanvrajati annasau | siddhyati kṣaṇabhaṅgi tvāt na anyathā asya gatiḥ bhavet || pūrva deśa aviyuktasya svabhāvasya anuvartanāt | nahi deśa antara prāptiḥ sthairye tasya upapadyate || 	When a man passes from place to place, one after the other,—it is so because he is in a perpetual flux; if it were not so, there could be no such ‘going’; if he remained fixed, permanently, then the man, not dissociated from his previous position, would continue to remain there; and as such he could not get at another place 
nabhasaḥ nirupākhya tvāt na abhivyaktiḥ prakalpate | atyakṣa tvāt ca khe na ayam ālokaḥ sa tathā īkṣyate || 	kāśa being undefinable and vague, there can be no ‘manifestation’ of it; and as it is beyond the reach of the senses, what is seen in the pit, is not ākāśa, but light 
kiñca śabdavat ākāśe api abhivyaktiḥ na yujyate | jñānam hi vyaktiḥ eṣā ca nityam syāt hetu sannidheḥ || yathā ca vyañjakaḥ śabde na kathañcid prakalpate | tatra atra evam para upādhiḥ śabda buddhau sati bhramaḥ || na atas dīrgha ādayaḥ sarve dhvani dharmāḥ iti sthitam  | dhvanīnām vyañjaka tve hi tat syāt tat ca nirākṛtam || 	Further, as in the case of the word-sound, so in the case of ākāśa also, there can be no ‘manifestation’; such ‘manifestation’ would mean cognition; and this would be everlasting, as its cause would be always there.—Just as, in the case of the word, there can be no manifester,—so it cannot be in the present case also; and in reality, it is an illusion appearing, through extraneous circumstances, in regard to the cognition of the word-sound. Hence the conclusion is that length, shortness and the rest are not properties of the articulation. They could be so only if the articulations were the manifesters of the word-sound; and this idea has been rejected 
atyanta bhedinaḥ api ete tulya pratyavamarśane | śaktāḥ śabdāḥ tad arthāḥ ca iti asakṛt carcitam purā || na atas dṛṣṭa artha sambandhaḥ śabdaḥ bhavati vācakaḥ | sva vṛttyāḥ vastutas tu eṣa vācakaḥ na iti sādhitam || 	It has been frequently explained before that words and things that are entirely different from one another are capable of providing the same ideas. Hence it is not true that the word becomes expressive only when its relationship to its denotation has been apprehended. because, as already explained before, in reality, the word, by itself, is not expressive at all 
mithyā avabhāsinaḥ hi ete pratyayāḥ śabda nirmitāḥ  | jāti sva lakṣaṇa ādīnām vācya nācaka tā sthiteḥ  || tad bhrāntyā vyavaharttāraḥ vailakṣaṇye api vastutas  | go śabdaḥ ekaḥ eva iti manyante sama buddhayaḥ || tasmāt dvijātinā proktam bahu asambaddha bhāṣiṇā  | śabda bhedam puraskṛtya yat tat sarvam anāspadam || 	As a matter of fact, all cognitions produced by words are expressive of what is unreal; because of the fact that there can be no denotation of the ‘universal’ or of the ‘specific individuality’ and such things; but even though in reality, there is diversity, people, through illusion, come to treat and speak of the word—‘cow’ for instance,—as one only,—regarding all as the same.—This much of what has been said by the great brāhmaṇa (mīmāṃsaka) on the basis of the diversity of words is entirely baseless 
tathā hi hasta kampa ādeḥ na eka tvam buddhi bhedataḥ | śīghra manda ādi bhedena tad vyaktiḥ ca nirākṛtā || sāmānyam na ca tatra ekam anugāmī upalakṣyate | saṅketāt pratiṣedha ādi gati aṅgam ca bhavati asau || 	For instance, the shaking of the hand and such gestures are not regarded as one and the same (and yet they indicate affirmation and denial). The cognitions of the word-sound that are produced have the varying characteristics of length, shortness, etc.—[which also shows that the word is not one];—the idea that the one word is variously ‘manifested’ has been discarded. There is no ‘commonalty’ (common character) perceptible in the several appearances of the word; and it is only through convention that they become aids to the cognition of denial, affirmation and the rest 
sākṣāt śabdāḥ na bāhya artha pratibandha vivekataḥ | gamayanti iti ca proktam vivakṣā sūcakāḥ tu amī || 	It has been already explained that words do not bring about the cognition of things directly,—because there is no invariable concomitance between words and external things; all that the words do is to indicate the presence (in the speaker) of the desire to speak (of things) 
tasyāḥ kārya tayā te hi pratyakṣa anupalambhataḥ | niścitāḥ iti tena atra kārya kāraṇa tā sphuṭā || 	Words are definitely known—through perception and non-apprehension—as the effect of the desire to speak; hence between them the relationship is clearly that of cause and effect 
kārya kāraṇa bhāvaḥ ca samayāt yena niścitaḥ | sa vivakṣām prapadyeta śabdebhyaḥ hasta kampa vat || 	It is only when the man has definitely recognised the said causal relationship through convention that he comprehends, from words, the desire to speak; as in the case of the gestures of the hand 
vivakṣā vartinā arthena kārya kāraṇa tā ātmakaḥ | śabdānām eṣa sambandhaḥ samaye sati jāyate || tena sāmayikaḥ proktaḥ tena ca dyotanāt atas  | samayaḥ api ucyate teṣām sambandhaḥ na tu mukhyataḥ || 	It is only when the convention is there that there comes about the causal relationship of the word with the object varying with the speaker’s intentions. It is on this account that it has been declared to be ‘due to convention’; and inasmuch as it is manifested by convention, the said relationship comes to be spoken of as ‘convention’ itself,—but not directly, (only figuratively) 
kārya kāraṇa bhūtābhyām vastubhyām anyaḥ eva na | kārya kāraṇa tā yogaḥ te eva tu tathā udite || 	The relation of cause and effect is not anything different from the things that are the cause and the effect; it is these things themselves that are spoken of as such 
te ca pratyekam eka ātma rūpa tvena jaḍaiḥ gate | saṅketa vyavahāra āpta kāla vyāptiḥ atas matā || 	Each of the two is apprehended by dull-witted men as one and the same; thus it is that it is held to continue during all the time from the convention to the usage 
ekaḥ tu vāstavaḥ na eva sambandhaḥ iha yujyate | asaṅkīrṇa tayā arthānām bhede asambandha tā bhavet || 	It is not possible for the relationship to be real and one. because the things denoted being distinct and diverse, there would be no relationship at all 
samayaḥ pratimartyam ca pratyuccāraṇam eva ca | ityādi atas pareṇa uktam paranītim a jānatā || samayaḥ hi na sambandhaḥ nara dharma tayā tayoḥ | dyotakaḥ sa tu tasya iti sambandhaḥ syāt na mukhyataḥ  || pratyuccāraṇam enam ca na pare pratijānate | īśa ādeḥ pratiṣiddha tvāt sarga ādau na ca tat kṛtam || 	As regards the assertion that—“the convention being made for each mortal being, or for each utterance, etc. etc.”—has been made without knowledge of the view of the other party. As a matter of fact, the convention as constituting the relationship does not belong to the two factors (word and its meaning),—it belongs to the man; the only relationship between the two is that one serves to manifest (indicate) the other; and this relationship also is not direct.—Nor do the other party hold the convention to pertain to each utterance;—nor (according to them) is the convention made by god, or any other being, at the beginning of creation; as the idea of such beings has been already rejected 
pratyekam yaḥ ca sambandhaḥ sannibhaḥ bhinnaḥ kṣaṇabhaṅgataḥ | tulya pratyavamarśaḥ ca bhede api na virudhyate || 	The relationship with each being must be different, because of ‘perpetual flux’; as for the idea of ‘similarity’, that is not incompatible with difference 
krameṇa jāyamānāḥ ca dhiyaḥ tad viṣayāḥ sphuṭam | tasya api āhuḥ kramam tāsām akramaḥ hi anyathā bhavet || 	The cognitions of things clearly appear in succession; hence they declare that (relationship) also to be successive otherwise there would be no succession

It is not that one connection or relationship is present in the mind of the speaker, and an entirely different one in that of the hearer; because it is of one and the same form and is present, as such, in the minds of both. When the speaker proceeds to lay down a connection for the benefit of the hearer, he lays down only that connection which has been known to himself from before. Thus, inasmuch as its recognition always appears in the same form,—even when the word, etc. are different, he comes to cognise the oneness (of the connection) 
ghaṭa ādau api sāmānyam prāk eva vinivāritam  | na hi bhūta guṇa prakhyā kācid ākṛtiḥ iṣyate || na ca asya ākṛtitaḥ siddhā śaktiḥ ap dhāraṇa ādiṣu | teṣām api hi nitya tvam ākṛteḥ yadi abhedinaḥ  || bhede sambandha doṣaḥ tu tad utpattau tu anitya tā  | atas na ākṛtitaḥ yuktā śaktiḥ ap dhāraṇa ādiṣu || ghaṭa ādeḥ vyatireke api śakteḥ doṣāḥ ime dhruvam | ap dhāraṇa ādi tat kāryam nityam evam prasajyate 	As regards the jar and other things also, the ‘universal’ has been already discarded.—The ‘configuration’ (‘universal’) is not held to be a quality of material substances.—Nor is the capacity of the jar, to contain water for instance, known from its ‘universal’,—if the jar, etc. are non-different from the ‘universal’, then, like it, they also should be eternal. If then, they are different from the ‘universal’, then it becomes open to objections relating to the relation between the two.—If the relationship were something produced, then the universal would be non-eternal.—Hence the capacity (of the jar) to contain the water cannot be due to the ‘universal’,—even if the jar etc. were different,—there would surely be all these objections regarding the ‘capacity’; and the effects of this ‘capacity’, in the shape of the containing of water, etc. would thus have to be regarded as eternal

A man who has no knowledge of the convention (bearing on the word), or when he has forgotten it,—does the cognition of the meaning appear in the same one man? Because the potency restricted to the production of that cognition is there all the time,—the idea is that the eternal potency is effective only when it is itself known,—so that, if the known potency be different from the unknown one,—then it loses its eternality;—while if it is the same, why is this distinction set forth?

anyathā eva upapanna tvāt śaktiḥ boddhum na śakyate | śabdāt sāmayikāt yasmāt pratipattiḥ an ākulā || 	The potency cannot be cognised in the manner suggested; because the phenomenon is quite explicable otherwise; for instance, there is no difficulty in the comprehension of the meaning of the word from the word itself as aided by convention

artha dyotana śakteḥ ca sarvadā eva vyavasthiteḥ  | tad hetuḥ artha bodhaḥ api sarveṣām sarvadā bhavet || tasmin saṅketa sāpekṣā śaktiḥ ced parikalpyate | nanu upakārī apekṣyeta na upakāryā ca sā acalā || 	As the potency indicative of the meaning remains there at all times, the comprehension of the meaning brought about by it would also be there at all times and for all men.—If, for that, it is assumed that the potency is dependent upon convention, then it would be dependent upon a helper; and being helped, it could not be permanent, eternal 
artha dyotana hetoḥ ca saṅketasya nara āśrayāt | śaktau itara janyāyām api mithyā tva sambhavaḥ || 	Inasmuch as the convention that serves to indicate the meaning is dependent upon man,—there would be possibility of ‘falsity’ (mistake) in the potency, even though born otherwise 
nānā artha dyotane śaktiḥ bhavatu ekasya hi dhvaneḥ | na agnihotra ādayaḥ tu arthāḥ sarve sarva upayoginaḥ || tad iṣṭa viparīta artha dyotanasya api sambhavāt | nitya śabda artha sambandha kalpanā vaḥ nirarthakā || 	A single word may have the potency to express several meanings. Even so, such things as the ‘agnihotra’ and the like, cannot all be of use to all men; because it is possible that they may express things contrary to what is desired by a certain person. Hence your assumption of an eternal relationship between the word and its meaning is entirely futile 
saṅkete ca vyapekṣāyām nitya sāmarthya lakṣaṇaḥ | kim akāraṇaḥ eva ayam sambandhaḥ paripoṣyate || siddha upasthāyinaḥ tasya na hi kaścid samīkṣyate | saṅketa vyatirekeṇa vyāpāraḥ artha avabodhane || 	When there is need for the convention, why are you seeking to bolster up, without reason, the ‘relationship’ in the shape of the eternal potency?—In the matter of expressing the meaning, there is not found, apart from convention, any operation of such a full-fledged entity as the ‘relationship’ 
tathā hi vyavahāraḥ ayam na dṛṣṭaḥ samayam vinā | tasmāt sambandha siddhiḥ ca iti anarthā iyam paramparā || 	Any functioning (of the relationship) has never been perceived, in the absence of convention.—If it be asserted that the relationship proceeds from the convention,—then disastrous indeed would such a regress be 
nara icchā mātra sambhūta saṅketāt api kevalāt | yujyate vyavahāraḥ ca tatas yogaḥ na siddhyati || 	All usage becomes explicable on the basis of mere convention proceeding from the whims of men; hence there is no reason for postulating the relationship

How then can such an assumption be made? 
tad gavāśva ādayaḥ śabdāḥ nitya sambandha yoginaḥ | saṅketa savyapekṣa tvāt na eva gāvi ādi śabda vat || 	For these reasons, all such words as ‘cow’, ‘horse’ and so forth cannot have any eternal relationships,—because they are dependent upon convention,—like such words as ‘gāvī’ and the like 
go śabde avasthite yogye tad aśakti ja kārita akāritāt | gāvi ādeḥ api go buddhiḥ mūla śabda anusāriṇī || tat na evam śanaka ādīnām saṃskṛta anavabodhanāt  | mūla śabda anusāreṇa katham artha gatiḥ bhavet || tasmāt śabda artha sambandhaḥ nityaḥ na abhyupagamyate | sa tu sāmayikaḥ yuktaḥ sarvathā tasya sambhavāt 	The capable (expressive) word ‘go’ being there, if the idea of the cow arises from the use of the corrupt form ‘gāvī’,—it is due to its resembling the original (correct) word;—such use being due to the incapacity (of the speaker).” This cannot be right. How can any such cognition of the right meaning appear on account of the resemblance to the original correct word, among fishermen, etc., who are ignorant of the Sanskrit language?—For these reasons it cannot be admitted that there is an eternal relationship between words and meanings. It can only be based upon convention; as that is possible in all cases

Hence any subsequent ideas that might appear (as based upon the Veda) would be one whose basis has been destroyed, and it might be assumed that they may all be false and wrong, arising from delusion, stupefaction, and such other sources; and hence the Veda now available would be only a mere semblance of the original.—All these notions might go on arising until reasons are not available to the contrary

If that were not so, then, for you, like the Veda, there would be no book written by men; so that the composing of all meaningless (or wicked) works is rendered impossible at one stroke! Because there could be no certainty that this man is uttering words exactly as they had been used previously by others,—therefore like the relationship, they also could not be regarded as beginningless 
pareṇa uktān bravīmi iti vivakṣā ca īdṛśī bhavet | tulya pratyavamarśāt hi vibhramāt karma bheda vat || 	The idea that ‘I am using the words that have been used by other persons’ would proceed from illusion, due to the recognition of similarity; just as there is in the case of acts

Consequently the letters pronounced by each man must be regarded as distinct,—like the jar and such things. This difference being quite clear, why are you denying the signs of that difference? 
prāk ca jātyā ghaṭa ādīnām vyavahāra upalakṣaṇam | niṣiddham tat asattvena vyaktyā ca tat ayogataḥ || 	The idea that ‘in the case of the jar, etc. their use is characterised and indicated by the “universal”’ has already been discarded; because the universal does not exist, and because it can have no connection with the individual thing 
tālu ādi jātayaḥ tasmāt sarva puṃsva vyavasthitāḥ  | na atas vaktā dhvanīn tābhiḥ upalakṣya nirasyati || tat na tad jātayaḥ bhinnāḥ śabda abhivyakti hetavaḥ | yāvat varṇam pravartante vyaktayaḥ vā tad anvitāḥ  || 	All such universale, therefore, as ‘palate’ and the rest vary in all men; consequently when the speaker utters word-sounds, he does not do so through those universals 2683) Thus there are no distinct universals of these articulations. Which could serve to bring about the manifestation of the word-sounds; nor are there as many of these as there are letters 
tat na tālu ādi saṃyoga vibhāga krama pūrvakam  | dhvanīnām ānupūrvyam te jātyā ca ubhaya nitya tā || yathā na bhramaṇa ādīnām bhāgāḥ jāti upalakṣitāḥ  | krama anuvṛttiḥ evam no tālu ādi dhvani varṇa bhāj || 	2685) Just as in the actions of moving about, etc. there is no order of sequence through the universals,—so too there is none among the palate, etc., the articulation and the letter 
vyaktīnām api no saukṣmyāt jāti dharma avadhāraṇam | tad vaśena na varṇānām vyāpi tve api krama grahaḥ || 	The cognition of the properties of the universal cannot be due to the subtle nature of the individuals; not can there be, through this, the cognition of order among the letters, even though these are all-pervading 
tat na dhvani guṇān sarvān nitya tvena vyavasthitān | varṇāḥ anupatantaḥ syuḥ artha bheda avabodhinaḥ || 	Consequently, the letters, following the properties of the articulations, which appear as eternal, cannot become expressive of diverse meanings 
anyat ca jātayaḥ bhinnāḥ śabda abhivyakti hetavaḥ | yāvat varṇam pravartante vyaktayaḥ vā tad anvitāḥ || iti vyañjaka sadbhāvāt nityam śabda upalambhanam | atas vyakti krama ātmā api yuktaḥ varṇa kramaḥ na te || 	There is another point: granting that ‘there are universals which serve to manifest the sounds, and there are as many of these as there are letters’;—under this view, as the manifester would be always there, the sound should be heard at all times. Consequently, the order of sequence among the letter-sounds cannot be in accordance with the order of the manifestations 
vyakti sambaddha rūpāṇām jātīnām ca vyavasthitau | vyaktīnām api nitya tvam durvāram anuṣajyate || jāti sambandha rūpāṇām vyaktīnām vā vyavasthitau | jātīnām api anitya tvam akāmasya api te bhavet || 	If the universals continue to exist as related to the individuals, the eternality of the individuals also is irresistible. or (conversely), if the individuals exist as related to the universals, then the universals also should be noneternal, even if you do not relish it 
abhivyakteḥ ayoge ca purastāt upapādite | ittham pratāyamānāḥ syuḥ varṇāḥ te na avabodhakāḥ || 	The fact that there can be no connection with manifestation having been already established, the letters thus could never be expressive

It has also been proved that the comprehension of the meanings of words is possible only when words are not eternal.—When one letter-sound is produced by the ‘desire to utter,’ following from the desire to utter another letter-sound,—the former is heard immediately after the latter;—the cognition proceeding from the cognition of the preceding letter is not heard very quickly; in fact, with the aid of the remembrances of the previous letters, the latter brings about its own remembrance later on. Thus it has the character of an effect, in relation to the cognitions leading up to, and apprehending, it.—Or, the order of the letters may be dependent upon men. From all this it follows that the letters clearly vary with each word; as is found in the case of such words as ‘dama’-‘mada’, ‘latā’-‘tāla’ etc., where the letters are the same but their order different in the two words. It is under this order of sequence that these words become expressive of different meanings.—Consequently, the assumption of the ‘sphoṭa’ also is absolutely futile in this connection 
sa hi artha pratipatti artham śābdikaiḥ parikalpitaḥ  | varṇāḥ eva ca tad śaktāḥ iti anarthā asya kalpanā || dṛśyasya adṛṣṭitaḥ ca asya nāstitā adhyavasīyate | adṛśya tve tu na eva ayam liṅga vat jñāpakaḥ bhavet || 	The ‘sphoṭa’ has been assumed by the grammarians for the purpose of explaining the cognition of the meanings of words.—But the letters themselves being competent to express the meaning of words, the assuming of the said sphoṭa is futile. As it would be perceptible (if it existed), but is not perceived, it is concluded that it does not exist.—If it is imperceptible, then it cannot be indicative, like the inferential indicative (which is effective only when perceived) 
sattā mātreṇa tat jñānam hetu bhāva vyavasthiteḥ | tasya jñāpaka tā iṣṭā ced netra vat sarvadā bhavet || saṅketa anavabodhe api varṇānām aśrutau api | tad bhāvi artheṣu vijñānam śakta kāraṇa saṃnidheḥ || tathā hi nitya sattvaḥ ayam na ca apekṣā asya kācana  | dhvani saṃketa varṇaiḥ ca tad vyaktiḥ na api adarśanāt || jñānam hi vyaktiḥ iti āhuḥ tat jñānam na ca vidyate  | tatas nirarthakā eva asya vyañjakasya api kalpanā 	Be it be urged that—“the cognition follows from its mere existence; and as its causal character is there, it is held to be able to bring about the cognition like the visual organ”;—then, the answer is that, in that case, the said cognition would be there at all times;—even when there is no knowledge of the convention, and there is no hearing of the letters,—there would be cognition proceeding from the sphoṭa, as its efficient cause would be there always; as this entity (sphoṭa) is eternal. (According to the grammarian), and it has no need for anything else. Nor can there be ‘manifestation’ of it by articulation or convention or letters; as it is never perceived; it is cognition itself that is spoken of as ‘manifestation’ and there is no cognition of it. Hence it follows that the assumption of the ‘manifester’ of the sphoṭa is also futile 
nādena āhita bījāyām antyena dhvaninā saha | āvṛtta paripākāyām buddhau śabdaḥ avabhāsate || iti etat api tena atra nirnimittam prakalpitam | tasyām api na śabdaḥ anyaḥ bhāsamānaḥ hi lakṣyate || 	What happens is that the articulation plants the seed in consciousness, and it becomes developed by the last articulation,—and therefore the word appears in the consciousness”.—This assumption also is made without reason. Because even so, the word is not perceived to appear as anything different (from the letters) 
janyatām vyajyatām vā api dhvanibhiḥ krama bhāvibhiḥ  | ye api sphoṭasya manyante kramaḥ teṣām virudhyate  || na hi krameṇa yujyete vyakti jātī niraṃśake | eka rūpa abahirbhāvāt te syātām sarvathā eva hi || 	Whether the sphoṭa is produced or manifested by the articulations which appear in succession,—such succession is incompatible with the view of those who uphold the sphoṭa. When the sphoṭa is indivisible (without parts), there can be neither manifestation nor production of it in succession. As they would never lie outside the one and the same form,—they would be there for all 
sāṃśa tve api yathā varṇāḥ krameṇa pratipādakāḥ | sphoṭa aṃśāḥ api kim na evam kim adṛṣṭāḥ prakalpitāḥ || 	Even if the sphoṭa is with parts (divisible), as the letters expressing them would do so only in succession, why should not the sphoṭa-parts also be likewise? Why should unseen ones be assumed? 
jātau vyaktau kṛtāyām ced ekena dhvaninā sakṛt  | nitarām vyakti siddhi artham varṇān anyān prayuñjate || yatas duravadhārā asya prakṛtiḥ sā tathā kṛtā  | samāna vyaktikaiḥ varṇaiḥ bhūyas api vyajyate paraiḥ || 	Even when the producing and the manifesting (of the entire sphoṭa) have been done once by one articulation, people pronounce the other letters for the purpose of a clearer manifestation; because it is difficult to determine it as manifested once;—therefore it is manifested again and again by means of letters with similar appearances.” 
tasya eva anyasya vā ekasya kim na āvṛttau punar punar | vyaktiḥ āvarttate tasya nanu evam aviśeṣataḥ || 	When, sir, that same, or something else, is repeated again and again,—is it not the manifestation of it that is repeated,—there being no difference? 
viṣaya indriya saṃskāra rūpā vyaktiḥ ca varṇa vat | asya api pratiṣeddhavyā tad ābhāse api cetasi || 	The ‘manifestation’,—as in the case of letters,—can only consist in the embellishment of the object or the sense-organ concerned. And here also, in regard to the cognition envisaging the sphoṭa, the said ‘manifestation’ can be denied in the same way (as in the case of letters) 
tasmāt pratyakṣataḥ pūrvam krama jñāneṣu yat padam | samasta varṇa vijñānam tad artha jñāna kāraṇam || 	From all this it follows that it is the word that is apprehended on the wake of the previous successive cognitions of all the component letters,—which is the cause of the comprehension of the meaning 
antya varṇe hi vijñāte sarva saṃskāra kāritam | smaraṇam yaugapadyena sarva varṇeṣu jāyate || 	What happens is that—when the final letter in the word has been cognised, the impressions left by the cognition of all the letters brings about the remembrance of all the letters simultaneously 
sarveṣu ca etad artheṣu mānasam sarva vādinām iṣṭam samuccaya jñānam krama jñāteṣu satsu api || 	All parties agree that there is such subjective (cumulative) cognition in connection with all things,—even when they are cognised in a certain order of sequence 
naced tat abhyupeyeta krama dṛṣṭeṣu nā eva hi  | śata ādi rūpam jāyeta tad samuccaya darśanam || 	In case this is not admitted, then, in connection with things seen one after the other, there could be no such cumulative cognition as there is in the idea of ‘a hundred’ and other numbers 
tena śrotra manobhyām syāt kramāt varṇeṣu yadi api  | pūrva jñānam parastāt tu yugapad smaraṇam bhavet || 	Thus then, though, in regard to the letters, the cognitions, auditory and mental, that appear at first are in an order of sequence,—yet, later on, there is remembrance of them all, at the same time 
tad ārūḍhāḥ tatas varṇāḥ na dūra artha avabodhanāt | śabdāt atha matiḥ tena laukikaiḥ abhidhīyate || 	Thus the letters do enter into it; as the things denoted are not far removed from them; this is the reason why people speak of the cognition as proceeding from the word 
ākāravati vijñāne sarvam etat ca yujyate | anyathā hi vinaṣṭāḥ te bhāseran smaraṇe katham || 	All this is quite compatible with the view that cognitions have forms; otherwise, as they would be destroyed, how could they figure in the remembrance? 
atha varṇāḥ tirobhūta vyaktayaḥ viditāḥ purā | smaryante avasthitāḥ eva na spaṣṭa ābha prasaṅgataḥ || 	If it is argued that—“the previously cognised letters have only their appearance concealed, but when remembered, they are there all right”,—then, the answer is that—it cannot be so; as, if it were so, then there would be a clear idea of them 
apāstā ca sthitiḥ pūrvam tad sthitau smaraṇam bhavet | varṇa anubhava vijñāna kāle eva eka hetutaḥ || 	Such continuance, however, has been already rejected; if there were such continuance, then the remembrance should appear at the time of the cognition of the apprehension of the letters; because the two would have one and the same cause 
gauḥ iti eka mati tvam tu na eva asmābhiḥ nivāryate | tad grāhya eka artha tābhyām ca śabde syāt eka tā matiḥ || 	We are not objecting to the single cognition in the form of ‘gauḥ’, the cow; but the notion of oneness regarding the word is due to the facts that it is apprehended by a single idea and (2) that it denotes a single thing 
śaighryāt alpa antara tvāt ca go śabde sā bhavet api | devadatta ādi śabdeṣu spaṣṭaḥ bhedaḥ pratīyate || 	The unitary conception may be possible in the case of the word ‘go’ on account of the rapidity (of its utterance) and of the smallness of the interval; but in the case of such words as ‘Devadatta’, the difference is clearly perceived 
varṇa utthā ca artha dhī eṣā tad jñāna anantara udbhavāt | yā īdṛśī sā tad utthā hi dhūma ādeḥ eva vahni dhīḥ || 	The cognition of the meaning must be regarded as arising from the letters; because it appears after the cognition of these; what is like it arises from that,—like the cognition of fire arising from smoke 
na varṇa bhinna śabda ābha jñāna anantara bhāvinī  | artha dhīḥ vidyate tena na anyaḥ śabdaḥ asti vācakaḥ || 	As a matter of fact, the cognition of the meaning is not found to follow after a cognition envisaging a verbal entity apart from the letters; hence no other word can be expressive (of that meaning) 
kārya tā vyavahāra aṅgam sarvatra eva viniścitau | anvaya vyatirekau hi vyāptiḥ tena iha niścitā || 	In all cases, positive and negative concomitances are definitely known to be the ground for regarding one thing as the effect of another; and it is thus that the invariable concomitance is recognised in the case in question 
anityeṣu eva varṇeṣu vācaka tve prasādhite | pratyabhijñā anumāne ca niraste nitya sādhane || 	It having been established that expressiveness belongs to noneternal letters,—the ‘recognition’ and ‘inference put forward in proof of eternality, become annulled

What actually appears in consciousness is well-known, without cogitation;—even ordinary fishermen know that that alone can form the ‘subject’.—And yet, it is on this very point that dispute has arisen among babblers. There can be no dispute regarding a thing where diversity is created only through one’s whim

The letter ‘ra’ that might be elsewhere cannot be said to appear in any other order of sequence, from out of air. Because every one of the letters has been declared to be one and eternal. If it were not so, then ‘recognition’ put forward by you as a reason for eternality’ and ‘oneness’ would be inconclusive; as it would be present even when the letters are diverse 
na ca vyakti kramaḥ vākyam nitye vyakti niṣedhanāt | vākya tā yogataḥ tasmāt nitya tvam na upapadyate || 	The order of sequence in the ‘manifestation’ cannot constitute the sentence, because it has been shown that there can be no ‘manifestation’ of what is eternal.—For this reason the eternality of the sentence cannot be due to its being related to the universal ‘sentence 
yathā vṛddhi ādayaḥ śabdāḥ icchā viracita arthakāḥ  | svarga yāga ādayaḥ śabdāḥ saṃbhāvyante tathā eva ca || na ca utpādya kathā rūpa nāṭaka ākhyāyikā ādiṣu | nityaḥ śabda artha sambandhaḥ vāstavaḥ asti vivakṣitaḥ || 	Just as the technical words like ‘vṛddhi’ have their meanings created by the whim of man,—so may also be regarded to be the case with words like ‘svarga’, ‘yāga’ and so forth.—In the case of such works of men as stories, dramas and novels, the connection between words and meanings is never meant to be real and eternal 
tatra api śakti nitya tvam niyogasya tu anitya tā | tad vaśāt eva nityāyām śaktau bhrāntiḥ pravarttate || 	In the case of the works cited also, the potency is eternal; the non-eternality attaches only to the particular use of the word; and it is on account of this latter fact that there arise doubts regarding the eternal potency.” 
nanu bāhyaḥ na tatra asti vyaktiḥ kva arthe prakalpyate | vikalpa pratibimbe ced tadvat vede api śaṅkyate || 	In reality, the thing spoken of in these works has no real existence outside; wherein then could the meaning be attributed?—If it be said that—“the meaning is attributed to the reflected conceptual content”,—then, the same may be said regarding the Veda also 
atīndriya artha sambandhām kaḥ vā śaktim prapadyate | na atas vede niyogaḥ api nara āyattaḥ prakalpyate || vṛddhebhyaḥ na ca tad bodhaḥ te api hi ajñāḥ svatas sthitāḥ  | sambhāvyā pratipattiḥ tu vyākhyānāt puruṣa āśrayāt || 	Who can ever cognise the potency, in the form of the connection between the word and its meaning? That is why in the case of the Veda, even the use is not regarded as due to human agency.—It could not be learnt from more experienced people; because, by themselves, these also are equally ignorant. the only cognition therefore that may be possible is through the explanations provided by men 
nanu paryanuyogaḥ ayam kṛtake ipi āgame samaḥ | na tatra śraddhyā vṛtteḥ artha saṃśayataḥ api vā || 	This objection is equally applicable to the scriptures composed (by persons).”a) Not so; because to these (scriptures) people have recourse through faith and confidence, even in regard to things that are open to doubt 
pratyakṣeṇa anumānena viśuddhe viṣaye sati | nahi evam vaidike śabde sa svayam pratyayaḥ yatas || 	We have confidence in the scripture]—The assertions whereof are found to be confirmed by perception and inference.—That cannot be the case with the Veda; as this has been held to be self-sufficient in its authority 
utpādya artha kathā dharmam an ālocya samam śrutau | evam ca idam asambaddham paraiḥ atra upavarṇitam || 	What the other party has urged in this connection is most irrelevant and has been said without perceiving that the said character of original stories and dramas, etc. is equally present in the Veda also 
śabda artha anādi tām muktvā sambandha anādi kāraṇam | na syāt anyat atas vede sambandha ādi na vidyate || upāya rahita tvena sambandha akaraṇa anumā | anākhyāna anumānam tu dṛṣṭena eva virudhyatām || 	Barring the eternality of the word and its meaning, there could be no other reason for accepting the eternality of their relationship. Therefore in regard to the veda, there can be no beginning for the said relationship.—The inference of the origination of the said relationship is negatived by the absence of means (causes); and as for the inference of the non-assertibility of pre-established relationship, it is set aside by direct sense-perception.”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepa-parihāra, 136-138] 
vṛddhānām dṛśyamānā ca pratipattiḥ punar punar | upāyaḥ iti tad hāniḥ asiddhā avagamam prati || 	The only means (of comprehending the meaning) consists in the perceiving of its repeated comprehension by experienced people. and certainly the failure of such means cannot be admitted, in regard to the bringing about of the comprehension”.—[Ślokavārtika-sambandha-kṣepaparihāra, 138-139] 
iti etat hi bhavet sarvam yadi veda artha niścayaḥ | vṛddhebhyaḥ api avisaṃvādī siddhaḥ syāt anyathā kṣatiḥ || 	All this would be true, only if there were certainty in regard to the meaning of the Veda; only in that case could the notions obtained from experienced men be true (in consonance with it); otherwise the whole fabric will fall to the ground 
siddha sarva upasaṃhāra vyāptika tvāt na sambhavi | saṅghāta tva ādi liṅgasya kiñcana pratisādhanam || 	As a matter of fact, there can be no ‘counter-argument’ against the reason ‘because it is an aggregate’; because this is a character whose invariable concomitance has been recognised as embracing all things 
sārthakāḥ pravibhakta arthāḥ viśiṣṭa krama yoginaḥ | pada vākya samūha ākhyāḥ varṇāḥ eva tathā uditāḥ || sārthaka pravibhakta artha viśiṣṭa krama yogi tā | niṣiddhā pauruṣeya tve vyāptiḥ avyāhatā tatas || 	When letters are expressive, with distinct meanings, and appear in a particular order of sequence,—they come to be known as ‘word’, ‘sentence’ and such groups; it is these that have been so spoken of as ‘aggregates—and it has been shown that all this—expressiveness, distinct meanings and order of sequence—is impossible in the case of words not emanating from personalities.—Hence the invariable concomitance (premiss, put forward by the buddhist) remains unshaken 
veda adhyayana vācya tve na tu evam vyāpti niścayaḥ | saṃdigdha vyatireki tvam vyaktam tena atra sādhane || 	There is no such certainty of invariable concomitance in regard to ‘the character of being spoken of as vedic study’; hence such a reason is open to the charge of its negative concomitance being doubtful 
tathāvidhe krame kārye nara aśaktau ca niścaye | siddhe vyāptiḥ iha iyam ca niścetum na eva śakyate || samasta nara dharmāṇām pratyakṣīkaraṇe sati | syāt eva niścayaḥ ayam ca sarvajñasya upapadyate || 	If it were known for certain that men are unable to bring about the said order of letters, etc.—Then alone would there be the invariable concomitance desired by the other party. That, however, can never be known for certain; such a certainty could be obtained only if the capacity and property of all men were perceptible; and this could be possible only for a person who is omniscient

kiṃca amunā prakāreṇa pauruṣeyam na kiñcana | śakyam saugatam api evam anumātum vacaḥ yatas || 	Cannot in this way an inference be made regarding the work of human beings—such as those of the Sugata (Buddha)?

sarvadā ca eva puruṣāḥ prāyeṇa anṛta vādinaḥ | yathā ādya tve na visrambhaḥ tathā atīta artha kīrtane || iti etena tvad uktena nyāyena ca na siddhyati  | karttā kaścid kvacid granthe svām kṛtim kathayan api || tatas ca apauruṣeyeṣu satya āśā tyajyatām iyam  | veda artha viparītāḥ hi teṣu arthāḥ pratipāditāḥ 	At all times, men are mostly prone to telling lies; just as there is no confidence in regard to things present, so also there is none regarding the description of past events’ (Ślokavārtika-sūtra 1. 1. 2; 144).—by this reason of your own, there can be no person recognised as the author of any work at all; even though he may be declaring it to be his own work.—Thus then, please abandon all hope in the truthfulness of the word which does not proceed from a personality; specially as in such words have been mentioned many things contrary to what has been said in the Veda 
api ca anādi tā siddhyet evam nānara saṃśrayaḥ | tasmāt akṛtaka tve vā syāt anyaḥ api āgamaḥ akṛtaḥ || 	Then again, in this way what would be proved would be only beginninglessness, not freedom from personal authorship. under the circumstances, if the Veda were regarded as not the work of any person, then the same may be said in regard to other revelations also 
tathā hi pārasīka ādi vyavahārāḥ para āśrayāḥ | nāstikānām ca siddhāntaḥ para saṃskāra bhāvikaḥ || 	The customs of the Pārasīkas and others may be based upon others; and the doctrine of the Atheists also may have its source in the ideas of other people 
īdṛśya kṛtaka tve ca kaḥ siddhe api guṇaḥ tava | avaitathya nimittam hi yatnaḥ ayam bhavataḥ akhilaḥ || 	Even if such freedom from authorship were proved,—what good would that do to you? As the whole attempt of yours has been towards the establishing of truthfulness 
kāla tva puruṣa tva ādau saṃdigdha vyatireki tā | pūrvavat karaṇa aśakteḥ narāṇām aprasādhanāt || 	As regards the probans—‘being time’ and ‘being person’,—the negative concomitance of these is doubtful; because, as shown before, it has not been proved that man is incapable of doing the work in question.—the idea of ‘manifestation’ also has been rejected. hence the speaker himself should be regarded as the ‘author’ (maker). thus then, in both the arguments, the instance is devoid of the pro-bandums 
nara upadeśa apekṣa tvāt kṛtakasya ca sādhanāt | svārthe vakra napekṣa tvam dharmi dṛṣṭāntayoḥ na ca || 	Because it is dependent upon the teaching of men, and because it has been proved to be the product of effort,—therefore ‘freedom from the speaker’ does not reside in the ‘subject’, nor in the corroborative instance 
nitya tve aste ca vākyasya dharmi dṛṣṭāntayoḥ api | nitya vākya udbhava tvasya spaṣṭā asiddhaḥ pratīyate || ittham ca apauruṣeya tve codanāyāḥ aniścite | sandigdha asiddha tā doṣaḥ paścimeṣu api hetuṣu || 	The eternality of the sentence having been rejected, the character of ‘proceeding from the eternal sentence’ is clearly recognised as non-existent in the ‘subject’ and in the corroborative instance.—Thus, then the fact of the Vedic injunction not being the work of a person being uncertain, your subsequent reasons also are open to the charge of being doubtful—hence—inadmissible

nara avijñāta rūpa arthe tamaḥ bhūte tatas sthite | vede anurāgaḥ mandānām sva ācāre pārasīka vat || avijñāta tad arthāḥ ca pāpa niṣyanda yogataḥ | tathā eva amī pravarttante prāṇi hiṃsā ādi kalmaṣe || 	The Veda thus is something of which the exact form or subject-matter is not known to men,—and hence it is like dense darkness, for which only dull-witted persons can have an attachment;—like the attachment of the Pārasīkas to their customs. Hence, like the Pārasīkas, those dull-witted persons also, ignorant of its meaning, have recourse to such sinful acts as the killing of animals and the like,—under the influence of the fruition of their past wicked deeds 
dharmam prati na siddhā atas codanānām pramāṇa tā | svatas anyebhyaḥ ca mandebhyaḥ tad artha anavadhāraṇāt || 	Thus, it has not been proved that the Vedic injunctions are the valid means of right knowledge of dharma; for the simple reason that its meaning cannot be ascertained by any one, either by himself or with the help of other dull-witted. persons 
jñāna āloka vyapāsta antaḥ tamaḥ rāśiḥ pumān atas  | śruti arthānām viviktānām upadeśa kṛt iṣya tām || 	For these reasons, please seek for a person whose inner darkness has been dispelled by the light of knowledge, and who is capable of teaching the clear meaning of the Veda 
jñāna āloka vyapāsta antaḥ tamaḥ rāśiḥ pumān atas  | śruti arthānām viviktānām upadeśa kṛt iṣya tām || 	For these reasons, please seek for a person whose inner darkness has been dispelled by the light of knowledge, and who is capable of teaching the clear meaning of the Veda 
evam ca pauruṣeya tve vedānām upapādite | svatas prāmāṇyam api eṣām pratikṣiptam ayatnataḥ || 	Thus then, it being established that the Vedas are the work of a personality, the self-sufficiency of their authority and validity also becomes overthrown without effort 
evam ca pauruṣeya tve vedānām upapādite | svatas prāmāṇyam api eṣām pratikṣiptam ayatnataḥ || 	Thus then, it being established that the Vedas are the work of a personality, the self-sufficiency of their authority and validity also becomes overthrown without effort

Even though this way the discarding of the validity will be dependent upon extraneous causes, there would be no infinite regress. Because after all, it would be dependent upon validity, and this is there, inherent in the cognition.”

In the case of one thing being dependent upon another thing of its own kind, there can be no resting ground; in the case of dependence upon something of another kind, its root is firmly established, because it is due to another cause.” 
bādhaka pratyayaḥ tāvat artha anya tva avadhāraṇam | saḥ anapekṣa pramāṇa tvāt pūrva jñānam apohate || 	The sublating cognition is always in the form of the cognition of the thing concerned as different from what is envisaged in the previous cognition; and as in this form, it is not dependent for its validity upon anything else, it sets aside that previous cognition.” 
tatra api tu apavādasya syāt apekṣā punar kvacid | jāta āśaṅkasya pūrveṇa sā api alpena nivarttate || 	It may be that there too there may be need for another sublating cognition in certain cases, where suspicion might be aroused in the mind of the person by the previous cognition; but that suspicion ceases after very little effort.”

Thus then, the investigator need not proceed beyond three cognitions; and when the man has not had any further sublating cognition produced, he need not suspect the presence of such cognition.” 
utprekṣate hi yaḥ mohāt ajātam api bādhakam | sa sarva vyavahāreṣu saṃśaya ātmā kṣayam vrajet || 	If the man, through stupidity, should imagine the existence of the sublating cognition, even when none has come about,—he would be beset with doubts in all his dealings and would be landed in utter ruin.” 
tathā ca vāsudevena ninditā saṃśaya ātma tā | na ayam lokaḥ asti kaunteya na paraḥ saṃśaya ātmanaḥ || 	Vāsudeva himself has deprecated such a suspicious nature; in the words—‘neither this world, nor the next,—o son of Kunti,—is for the man of suspicious nature’.”

deśa kāla nara avasthā bhedāḥ saṃvyavahārataḥ | siddhāḥ eva hi ye yasmin te apekṣyāḥ bādhaka arthinā || 	Place, time, man and circumstances,—diversities of these are met with in actual experience; hence when one is seeking for sublation, he should seek for them in these.”

evam santamase kāle yaḥ gavāśva ādi saṃśayaḥ | bhrānteḥ vā nirṇayaḥ tatra prakāśībhavana avadhiḥ || 	Similarly when at a time of dense darkness, there are doubts regarding the animal seen being a cow or a horse, followed by the ascertainment of the truth,—the limit of all this consists in the appearance of light.” 
tathā hi candra diś moha veda varṇa svara ādiṣu | puruṣa antara saṃpraśnāt anyathātva avadhāraṇam || 	Similarly, in regard to the moon, the misconception of the directions, and the letters and accents of the Veda, and such things,—that the truth is otherwise is ascertained by enquiries from other persons.”

The cognition of the excellences is not needed at the time. it is not as cognised that the excellences are operative in the matter; by their sheer presence they are competent to set aside the defects; and while they are there, there does not appear any cognition of the defects of the man.” 
doṣaiḥ ca ajñāyamāna tvāt na prāmāṇyam apodyate | an apodita siddham ca tat iha api svatas sthitam || 	Because the defects are not cognised, therefore they do not set aside the validity; not being set aside, it becomes established by itself here also.”

In the case of the veda, however, there being no author, there can be absolutely no suspicion for us regarding the presence of defects.—Consequently, just as validity (and reliability) is accepted in the case of the Veda, on the ground of its being independent and self-sufficient,—so the same validity becomes established in regard to the words of a trustworthy person also.” 
veda arthe anya pramāṇaiḥ yā sarvakālam asaṅgatiḥ | tayā eva asya pramāṇa tvam anuvāda tvam anyathā || 	The fact that other means of cognition never have any bearing upon what is said in the Veda establishes its validity.—otherwise, it would be merely reiterative.”

In both oases, the (corroborative) cognition is not produced by other means; hence they do not need corroboration by cognitions produced by other causes.” 
yathā tu eka indriya adhīna vijñāna antara saṅgatiḥ | pratyakṣe kāraṇam klṛptā tathā vede api kathyatām || 	Just as, in the case of the validity of sense-perception, there is the definite basis in the form of corroboration by another cognition produced by the same sense-organ,—the same should be asserted to be the basis in the case of the Veda also.” 
ekena eva hi vākyena deśa kāla na lāntara ādiṣu | labhyamāne artha saṃvāde na mṛgyam kāraṇa antaram || tasmāt dṛḍham yat utpannam vijñānam na visaṃvadet | deśa antara ādi vijñānaiḥ pramāṇam tat asaṃśayam || 	When the cognition brought about by any one sentence is found to be the same at all times and places, and in all men,—then no other basis need be sought for its validity. Thus then, when a firm conviction produced by a sentence is not found to be incompatible with the cognitions appearing at other times and places and in other men,—it is undoubtedly valid.” 
sādhyā na ca anumānena śabda ādīnām pramāṇa tā | pratyakṣasya api sā mā abhūt tad sādhyā eva aviśeṣataḥ || 	As a matter of fact, the validity of verbal and other cognitions is not to be proved by means of inference. otherwise the validity of sense-perception also might have to be proved by inference (which is absurd).”

nanu pramāṇam iti evam pratyakṣa ādi na gṛhyate | na ca ittham agṛhītena vyavahāraḥ avakalpate || 	As a matter of fact, sense-perception, etc. are not quite recognised as ‘pramāṇa’, ‘valid’; and until they are so recognised, no business would be possible 
pramāṇam grahaṇāt pūrvam svarūpeṇa pratiṣṭhitam | nirapekṣam ca tat sva arthe pramite mīyate paraiḥ || 	Before the cognition is apprehended, it remains there in its own form; and so far as its own objective is concerned, it is independent and self-sufficient and after its own objective has been cognised, the cognition itself comes to be cognised by other cognitions.” 
yathā ca aviditaiḥ eva cakṣuḥ ādibhiḥ indriyaiḥ  | gṛhyante viṣayāḥ sarve pramāṇaiḥ api ne tathā  || tena atra jñāyamāna tvam prāmāṇye na upayujyate | viṣaya anubhavaḥ api asmāt ajñātāt eva labhyate || 	Just as objects are apprehended by the eye and other sense-organs, which latter are themselves uncognised,—so, in the same manner are things apprehended by cognitions also, without these latter being themselves cognised. Hence becoming cognised is not of much use in the validity of the cognition. For the same reason the apprehension of things also is obtained from the cognition that is itself uncognised.” 
apramāṇam punar sva arthe pramāṇam iva hi sthitam | mithyā tvam tasya gṛhyeta na pramāṇa antarāt ṛte || 	Like valid cognition, invalid cognition also operates upon its object, by itself (independently); but the fact of its being false cannot be apprehended without another means of cognition.”

Thus then, it is only when there appears the cognition of the truth being otherwise,—or the cognition that the source of the cognition has been defective,—that the falsity (invalidity) of the cognition becomes recognised; not on any other grounds. At the time that it appears it is always recognised as valid.” 
atas yatra api mithyā tvam parebhyaḥ pratipādyate | tatra api etat dvayam vācyam na tu sādharmya mātrakam || 	For these reasons, even in cases where the falsity is explained to others,—these two ideas have to be pointed out,—and not mere similarity.”

Because for the other party also, there comes about an argument which is the reflection of the Buddhist argument; and thus being refuted by this, the argument (of the Buddhist) turns out to be the means of proving what is not true; and as such, it is not capable of setting aside the Vedic injunction which is inherently valid.” 
atra abhidhīyate yeṣām jātānām sthitiḥ iṣyate | teṣām eva tu nanu eṣā vyavasthā sa nibandhanā || 	The answer to the above is as follows:—as a matter of fact, the distinction that has been made has some basis only in regard to those things that are held to continue to exist after being produced

vyāpāraḥ kāraṇānām hi dṛṣṭaḥ janma atirekataḥ  | pramāṇe api tathā mā abhūt iti janma vivakṣyate || na hi tad kṣaṇam api āste jāyate vā apramā ātmakam | yena artha grahaṇe paścāt vyāpriyeta indriya ādi vat || 	The operation of causes has always been found to be something different from the birth of the effects; in order to preclude this from the case of cognition (pramāṇa), the term ‘birth’ (‘janma’) has been introduced [by Jaimini in his sūtra 1.1.4]—the idea being that the cognition does not continue to exist for even a single moment, and yet it is not born as invalid; on account of which it could operate only later on towards the apprehending of the object,—in the manner of the sense-organs.—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 54-55] 
atha api akṣaṇikam jñānam nityam ca a bhyupagamyate | abhyupeta virodhaḥ ayam evam yuktyā avabādhanam || 	If the cognition is held to be not-momentary and even eternal, then this goes against what has been accepted elsewhere, and it is also nullified by reasoning 
sādhita kṣaṇa bhaṅgam hi sarvam vastu sa vistaram | nityam ca janyate na iti kāraṇa apekṣitā asya kā || 	a) It has been demonstrated in detail that all things are in ‘perpetual flux’;b) As for the eternal thing, it is never produced; what need then could it have of a cause?

prāmāṇya niścayaḥ yasmāt tatra tanmātra bhāvikaḥ  | tasmin jāte ca sandeha viparyāsau anāspadau || 	Inasmuch as certainty regarding its validity would be obtained from the cognition itself, there can be no room for doubt or wrong cognition, etc 
niścaya āropa manasoḥ bādhya bādhaka bhāvataḥ | samāropa viveke hi niścayaḥ vartate akhilaḥ || 	Inasmuch as conviction and wrong cognition are mutually destructive—if wrong cognition becomes excluded, conviction remains entirely unaffected 
tatas ca codanā janya mati prāmāṇya siddhaye | doṣa varjita hetūttha bhāvāt yuktiḥ apārthikā || 	Thus then, for establishing the validity of the cognition arising from the Veda,—any such assertion as that it arises from causes free from defects and so forth, is of no use

yad rūpa niścayaḥ yasmāt jāyate yatra vastuni | tad viparyaya śaṅkāyāḥ tatas eva nivartanam || 	When a firm conviction has appeared in a certain form in connection with a certain thing, from a certain cause,—all suspicions to the contrary are removed by that same conviction 
yathā dhūma ādi liṅgebhyaḥ pāvaka ādi astitā gatau | tad nāstitva vyabacchedaḥ tatas eva upapadyate || 	When the existence of fire has become cognised through indicatives like smoke,—the idea of the non-existence of fire becomes discarded by that same cognition

yaḥ sandeha viparyāsa pratyayaiḥ viṣayīkṛtaḥ  | sthāṇu vat na hi tatra asti tadā tad rūpa niścayaḥ || 	When a thing has become the object of doubt or misconception, there can be no certainty regarding the real form of that thing as in the case of the post 
bali bhuj dhūma hetu uttha doṣa ādi pratyayaiḥ yathā  | sthāṇu tejaḥ apramāṇa ādi parebhyaḥ vyavasīyate || 	For example, (1) the post, (2) the fire, and (3) invalidity are cognised extraneously by means of the notions of (1) the crow, (2) smoke and (3) defects in the source of the cognition 
yat sandeha viparyāsa viṣaya tvam gatam tathā | paratas niścayaḥ tasya pramāṇa tvasya gamyatām || 	Because validity has been definitely pound to be subject to doubt and misconception,—therefore please understand that any certainty regarding it can be obtained only extraneously

kiṃca sarva pramāṇānām prāmāṇyam niścitam yadi | svatas eva tadā kasmāt mata bhedaḥ pravādinām || 	Further, if the validity of all cognitions is duly recognised as being inherent in them by themselves,—then why is there a difference of opinion among disputants? 
yena ekaiḥ svataḥ eva iti proprā cyaiḥ niyamaḥ ucyate | kiñcid svataḥ anyatas kiñcid paraiḥ ca aniyamaḥ mataḥ || 	That there is diversity of opinion is shown by the fact that] one party consisting of the ‘prācyas’ (easterners or ancients) assert definitely that “the validity of cognitions is always inherent, self-sufficient, in themselves”; while others assert that in some cases, the validity is self-sufficient, while in others it is due to extraneous causes;—and there is no hard and fast rule one way or the other 
vivādaḥ bhrāntitaḥ yasmāt sā ca niścaya bādhitā  | niścinvantaḥ tatas tattvam vivaderan na vādinaḥ || 	Dispute always arises from misconception,—and such misconception is rendered impossible by the certainty of conviction; hence when the various parties would have ascertained the truth (regarding the self-validity of cognitions), they would never quarrel among themselves

nanu apramāṇataḥ vṛttaḥ vidam vā kam visaṃvādam samaśnute | niścayaḥ paratas tasya bādhakāt pratyayāt mataḥ || pramāṇataḥ pravṛttaḥ tu na visaṃvādam aśnute | asya eva ca iṣyate asmābhiḥ svataḥ prāmāṇya niścayaḥ || 	One who acts in pursuance of an invalid cognition meets with non-conformity with reality; and certainty regarding invalidity has been held to be due to extraneous causes and ascertainable by a subsequent sublating cognition. On the other hand, one who acts in pursuance of a valid cognition does not meet with the said non-conformity; and it is in regard to this that we hold that there is firm conviction regarding its validity being inherent and self-sufficient.”

What is meant by us in regard to the subject of conviction regarding the self-validity of all cognitions is as follows:—In a case where the conviction regarding self-validity is not certain, what is cognised, by elimination is invalidity; because irrespectively of the fact of the real state of things being otherwise than that envisaged in the cognition,—and the fact of the source of the cognition being defective,—the conviction regarding its invalidity appears immediately after its birth.—Consequently, the invalid cognition cannot be said to be a case of the ‘reversal of validity’; hence no one would ever act in pursuance of the cognition that is not in conformity with reality; because there is always a certainty regarding its non-conformity 
janma atirikta kālaḥ ca kriyā kālaḥ na vidyate | kṣaṇika tvāt ghaṭa ādīnām iti asiddham nidarśanam || 	In the case of the jar, there is no time for action, apart from the time of its birth,—because it has a momentary existence; hence the corroborative instance is ‘inadmissible 
teṣām uttara kālam hi kulāla ādi anapekṣiṇām | sva upādāna ādi apekṣa tvāt svatas na asti pravarttanam || 	Subsequently to their birth, the jar, etc. do not depend upon the potter and other such causes; but they do depend upon their own constituent causes and other things; so that of the jar itself, there can be no action

Hence there can be certainty regarding self-validity only when there is cognition of effective action 2957) “What peculiar feature is there in the second cognition, different from those of the previous cognition, on account of which it is not regarded to be entirely like the previous cognition?” The answer to the above is as follows:—it is conformity with the real state of things that is called ‘validity’; and there is no feature of it except the repeated cognition of effective action.—The cognition envisaging effective action is clearly apprehended; and the apprehension becomes confirmed by the after-thought envisaging the same. Thus its own real validity haying been duly ascertained, it does not stand in need of any subsequent cognition of the same effective action. Thus the validity of the cognition becomes manifested in the very first cognition envisaging the said effective action; and thereby its validity becomes confirmed 
ādye hi aādye hi vastu viṣaye vastu saṃvāda lakṣaṇam  | dvitīyam na pravartteta tasya hetoḥ asambhavāt || aśoka stabaka ādau hi pāvaka adhyavasāyinaḥ | na dāha pāka nirbhāsi vijñānam jātu jāyate || jātau vā na vijātīyam jvalanāt tat prasajyate | tad kārya yogya tā mātra lakṣaṇa tvāt vibhāvasauḥ || 	If the initial cognition did not envisage a real entity, then the second cognition, in the form of confirmation by conformity to the real state of the thing, would not appear at all; as its cause would not be there. For example, when a man has the cognition of fire in reference to the cluster of aśoka-blossoms, there does not appear the cognition envisaging burning and cooking (which are not brought about by what has been cognised as fire). If this latter does appear, then the cognised object turns out to be not anything different from fire; because fire is only an entity that is characterised by the capacity for producing its effect (in the shape of burning, cooking and the rest)

When, however, there appears the cognition envisaging its effect, there are no such grounds; because there is direct perception of action, which is directly related to the entity cognised 
vṛttau abhyāsavatyām tu vailakṣaṇyam pratīyate | a tad viṣayataḥ jñānāt ādye aprāpte api tad phale || 	In the case of the initial cognition also, even though its effect may not have been seen, if the cognition has been repeated, a distinct peculiarity is perceived in it which differentiates it from cognitions not pertaining to the thing concerned, [and this establishes its validity]

In such a case even though the validity may be present there, it cannot be ascertained; it is recognised only through the subsequent cognition of its resultant activity. It is for this reason that the first cognition needs its corroboration; and for the same reason it is not necessary to seek for the corroboration of the corroborative cognition also 
bhrānti hetoḥ asadbhāvāt svatas tasya pramāṇa tā | prathamasya tadā abhāve pradveṣaḥ bhrānti saṃbhavāt || 	Of the second cognition, the validity is self-sufficient, because there are no causes for misapprehension; in the case of the first cognition, however, there is hostility towards its self-validity, on account of the possibility of misapprehension 
nanu tasya pramāṇa tve vijñānasya aviniścite | katham tatra pravartteta prekṣāvān īpsita āgateḥ || 	If the validity of the cognition is not definitely ascertained,—then how could any sane person have recourse to activity? Because what is wanted is not cognised.” 
ucyate saṃśayena eva varttate asau vicakṣaṇāḥ | vaicakṣaṇya kṣatiḥ tasya na ca evam anuṣajyate || 	Our answer to the above is as follows:—it is through the doubtful cognition itself that the clever man has recourse to activity; and this does not detract from his cleverness 
saṃśayena yatas vṛtteḥ tad prāmāṇya viniścaye | niścita upāya tā tena mānam sā ca sati api saṃśaye || 	It is because of the man having acted on the basis of a doubt, in regard to the ascertainment of validity,—that its being the proper means can be ascertained; so that there is this even when there is doubt 
saṃdehena pravṛttau me phala prāptiḥ bhavet yadi  | prāmāṇya niścayaḥ tatra jñātaḥ eva bhaviṣyati || na anyathā iti na ca api evam anuyogaḥ atra yuktimān  | upāye vartate kasmāt iti nahi anyathāgatiḥ || nahi upāyāt vinā kaścid upeyam pratipadyate  | iti saṃdeha vṛttaḥ api prekṣāvat tām jahāti na 	When I have recourse to activity on the basis of a doubtful cognition,—if i succeed in obtaining the fruit of that activity, then certainty regarding the validity of that cognition would be automatically apprehended; it cannot be ascertained in any other way.—Nor can it be reasonable to raise the question as to ‘how the man has recourse to the said means for the simple reason that there is no other way available. As a matter of fact, without the means, no one can get at the end.—Thus, even when acting on the basis of a doubtful cognition, the man does not lose his character of being a sane person 
nanu ca artha kriyā bhāsi jñānam svapne api vidyate | na ca tasya pramāṇa tvam tad hetoḥ prathamasya ca || 	As a matter of fact, cognition envisaging effective action is present in dreams also; and yet, on that account, it is not valid;—nor is its source, the former cognition, valid.”

This is the reason why the difference between the two states is clearly perceived 
syāt matam paratas tasya prāmāṇyasya viniścaye | prasajyate prameya tvam iti nanu avirodhi adaḥ || 	The following might be urged:—“it being ascertained that its validity is due to extraneous causes, the cognition should be regarded as ‘cognised’”.—There is no in congruity in this 
tad grāhya vastu apekṣam hi prāmāṇyam tasya gīyate | paratas avagateḥ tasya prameya tva vyavasthitiḥ || apekṣā bhedataḥ ca evam kārya kāraṇa tā ādi vat | pramāṇa tva prameya tva vyavasthā na virudhyate || 	The validity of the cognition is always asserted in reference to the thing apprehended by it; and this validity being apprehended by another cognition, the former cognition does become ‘cognised’;—and there is no incongruity in this, as the notions of ‘cognition and cognised’ are based upon relativity,—as in the case of ‘cause and effect’ and the like 
evam artha kriyā jñānāt pramāṇa tva viniścaye | na anavasthā para ākāṅkṣā vinivṛtteḥ iti sthitam || 	Thus, it is established that the idea of validity, being ascertained through the cognition of effective action, does not involve infinite regress; as all further need has ceased

In the case where the object is not in close proximity, the cognition arising from it must be valid, because it has been brought about by it (the perfect cause),—just like the cognition apprehending the object which is in close proximity (to the observer),

The purity (perfection) of the cause having become thus recognised, if, at the same time, there should arise the cognition of the yellow colour in connection with the conch-shell made of gold,—as that also would have been brought about by flawless causes, there would be certainty regarding the validity of that cognition,—just as in that of the cognition of the white colour in connection with the white conch-shell, which has led to effective action 
kṣudh ādi anupaghāta ādi vacanāt idam uktavān | bhāṣyakāraḥ api atas mohāt anavasthā iha codyate || 	The author of the Bhāṣya also has said the same thing by the mention of the attack of hunger, etc.; hence it is through sheer delusion that the infinite regress has been urged

evam ca artha kriyā jñānāt hetu śuddhi viniścitau | akṛtārtha kriye vṛtteḥ arthareṣā avācyā upapadyate || 	Thus the perfection of the cause being ascertained through the cognition of effective action,—in a case where there is no effective action at all, the functioning cannot be deprecated

Because the said ‘absence’ is a negative cognition, which is essentially different from the other form of positive cognition,—this other form being ‘non-apprehension’ according to you, and ‘inference’ according to us 
anayā eva upapattyā syāt aprāmāṇyam api svatas  | tatra api śakyate vaktum yasmāt nyāyaḥ ayam īdṛśaḥ || tasmāt svatas apramāṇa tvam sarvatra autsargikam sthitam  | bādha kāraṇa duṣṭa tva jñāna abhāvāt apodyate || 	By this same reasoning (that you have put forward) the invalidity also of cognitions may be proved to be inherent in them; as the same may be asserted in support of it as follows—‘therefore self-invalidity of cognitions is the general rule, and it is discarded when there is either absence of annulment, or absence of the cognition of its source being defective.’ 
tathā bodha ātmaka tvena buddheḥ prāptā apramāṇa tā | yathārtha jñāna hetūttha guṇa jñānāt apodyate || aprāmāṇye parāyatte bhavati eva anavasthitiḥ | pramāṇa adhīnam etat hi svatas tat ca apratiṣṭhitam || 	Similarly, the invalidity of cognition must be taken as following from its being of the nature of apprehension, and is discarded by the cognition of its being in conformity with the real nature of things and by the cognition of efficiency of its source.—If ‘invalidity’ were due to extraneous causes, there would be infinite regress; because it could be dependent upon the valid cognition, and this is itself unstable 
tathā hi bādhaka abhāvāt prāmāṇyam bhavatā ucayate | bādhā bhāvaḥ api abhāva ākhyam pramāṇa antaram iṣyate || tasya api bādhaka abhāvāt prāmāṇyam abhidhīyate | tatra tatra evam icchāyām vyavasthā na upalabhyate || anapekṣa pramāṇa tvam bādhaka pratyaye yatas | na siddham tena na eva ayam pūrva jñānam apohate || 	For instance, you assert ‘validity’ on the ground of the absence of sublating cognition; and ‘absence of sublation’ also is held to be a distinct form of cognition, named ‘non-apprehension’;—so that the validity of this latter also is asserted on the ground of the absence of sublating cognition; and this process proceeding on and on, there can be no resting ground (stability) 
atha api bādhaka abhāvam vinā prāmāṇyam iṣyate | kvacid ādye tathā abhāve pradveṣaḥ kiṃnimittakaḥ || 	If validity is admitted in some cases, even when there is no absence of the sublating cognition,—then why should there be hostility against the initial cognition?

What could be suspected would be the possibility of another sublating cognition with self-sufficient validity; but such a suspicion would be self-contradictory, and could never arise in regard to what has been duly ascertained 
svatas prāmāṇya pakṣe api svarasena eva niścayāt | kasmāt bādhaka sadbhāva siddhau yatnaḥ vidhīyate || tathā hi svarasena eva na yasmin māna niścayaḥ | niścīyate atra api ayatnena sāmarthyāt tatra bādhakaḥ || atas parīkṣaka jñāna trayam atra kim ucyate  | na ekasya api avakāśaḥ asti tasmin niścayataḥ svatas  || yadi ca utpadyate śaṅkā anupalambhe api saṃśayāt  | bādhā bhāva avinābhūtam ymāt na anupalambhanam 	Under the theory of the self-validity of cognitions, the validity being ascertained by itself, why should an effort be made to prove the existence of a sublating cognition?—Because, when the validity of a cognition is not definitely cognised by itself, its sublating cognition is got at without effort. Thus, why should there be said to be ‘three cognitions’ for the investigator? In fact there is not room for a single one; the conviction regarding it having come about by itself.—If it be held that—“even when no sublating cognition is actually found, there arises suspicion due to doubt; because the non-apprehension of sublating cognition is not always concomitant with its absence”;—then, under the circumstances, why have you become satisfied with only three (cognitions)? Because, as before, even when the sublating cognition is not there, its presence could always be suspected; and this suspicion of sublation could not cease until one met with conformity to effective action; hence the restriction to three only is entirely futile.—Thus then, even in a case where no sublation has actually appeared, its presence can always be suspected; specially as casuistry can never lead to the ascertainment of truth.—Even though a man may have had the unsublated cognition of the conch-shell as yellow, throughout his life,—such cognition can never become valid 
viśuddhi kāraṇa abhāvāt na upajāyeta bādhakam | anyena vā nimittena na atas śaṅkā nivarttate || 	It is just possible that the sublating cognition does not appear because the cause of the removal of the defect is not available, or because of some other reason; hence the suspicion regarding the possibility of its being there does not cease 
sa nimittā eva tena iyam āśaṅkā yatra mohataḥ  | śuddhi saṃvāda dṛṣṭau tu na āśaṅkā sudhiyaḥ bhavet || sa sarva vyavahāreṣu saṃśaya ātmā na jāyate | niḥsaṃśayā hi dhīḥ tasya śuddhi saṃvāda darśane || atra api yaḥ punar śaṅkām kaścid prakurute jaḍaḥ | saṃśaya ātmaka tā ye ajena manye tam prati ninditā || 	Thus, even where the suspicion (of sublation) is due to stupidity, there is always some ground for it; when there is cognition of the perfectness of the cause and that of conformity to reality, there arises no suspicion in the mind of the wise. so that he does not become beset with doubt in all his dealings: as his mind has become free from doubt, on the cognition of the said perfectness and conformity.—If even after this, a foolish, man entertains suspicions,—it is in reference to such a person that the suspicious character seems to have been deprecated by the unborn one (in the bhagavadgītā) 
deśa kāla anara avasthā bheda apekṣā prakalpite | prāmāṇya niścaye anyasmāt vyaktam prāmāṇya niścitiḥ || tathā hi deśa kāla ādau bādhā bhāvāt su niścitau  | pramāṇa antarataḥ prācye prāñce jñāne prāmāṇya niścayaḥ || 	If the ascertainment of validity is dependent upon the exigencies of place, time, the man and the circumstances,—it is clear that the definite cognition of validity is dependent upon extraneous causes. for instance, the place and time having been ascertained through the absence of sublation, the ascertainment of the validity of the initial cognition clearly follows from other means of cognition 
ṛṇa ādi vyavahāraḥ tu yaḥ vākyatraya yogyavān  | sa tādṛśa sthala ātmā eva na udāhāryaḥ pramā sthitau || arthi pratyarthinau tatra smṛtvā smṛtvā parisphuṭam  | nahi sūkṣma īkṣikām karttum labhete tatra vastuni  || vastu sthityā pramāṇam tu vyavasthāpyam chalāt nanu  | prakṛta apratirūpaḥ atas vyavahāraḥ udāhṛtaḥ 	As regards dealings regarding debt, etc. which admit of only three statements,—this condition (of three statements) is applicable to those cases only, and should not be cited in connection with validity.—In those cases, the two disputants make statements on recalling things to their memory, and do not find time to make a careful scrutiny of things. As regards the validity of cognitions however, things have got to be determined in regard to the real state of things,—and not by mere casuistry. Hence the dealings that have been cited are not analogous to the subject under consideration 
tri satya tā api devānām na eva niściti kāraṇam | ādyāt niścitya sadbhāve na eva syāt paratas api asau || 	The fact of the deities being called ‘trisatya’ cannot lead to any certainty (regarding validity); in fact, if this certainty does not follow from the very first (statement), it cannot follow from others 
tadīyam eva yena idam vacana dvayam uttaram | tad ādye pratyaya abhāve kaḥ viśeṣaḥ tad anyayoḥ || 	Inasmuch as the later two statements are of the same two men,—if there is no confidence in the first one, what peculiarity is there in the other two (which makes them more trustworthy)? 
atas pūrvoktayā yuktyā tvad pakṣe api anavasthitiḥ  | pramāṇa tva apramāṇa tve yathāyogam atas sthiteḥ  || 	Thus, in accordance with the reasoning set forth previously, there is infinite regress involved under your view also. and validity and invalidity remain as they are in reality

Under your view, there is no trustworthy person entirely free from all defects; and how can a person be ‘trustworthy’, when the mass of his ignorance has not been dispelled? because on the presence of the defects, it is always open to suspicion that his word may be false 
jāte api āpte tadīyaḥ asau guṇa oghaḥ kena śakyate | jñātum āpta praṇīte syāt yatas vākye avadhāraṇam || yaḥ api atīndriya dṛś paśyet tadīya guṇa sampadam | tasya api āpta praṇītena vacasā kim prayojanam || sa hi vākya nirāśaṃsaḥ svayam artham prapadyate | anyaḥ api āpta aparijñānāt tatas artham na avagacchati || 	Even though such a ‘trustworthy person’ may be born,—who could come to know of the host of his good qualities, and thereby have confidence in the words of such a trustworthy person?—If there were some one with supernormal vision who could perceive his excellent qualities,——what use could such a person have for any ‘words of the trustworthy person’? Because he would himself know all things, independently of all assertions. as for any other person, as he could not recognise the ‘trustworthy person’, he could never learn of things from his words 
svataḥ prāmāṇya vāde ca svataḥ niścaya jātitaḥ  | vināśa sambhava ayogāt kimartham vinivāraṇam || 	Under the theory of ‘self-validity’, the certainty comes about from the birth of the cognition itself; hence there can be no ‘mutilation’; what then is there to be prevented? 
na nāma dūṣyate vākyam doṣaiḥ guṇa nirākṛtaiḥ  | guṇa aniścayataḥ tat tu viniścetum na śakyate || 	It is true that the assertion is not vitiated by the defects, which are warded off by the excellences; but as there can be no certainty regarding the excellences, there can be no certainty regarding the said fact (of not being vitiated) 
vākyasya akartṛka tvam ca prāk eva vinivāritam | na atas kartuḥ abhāve tena na syuḥ doṣāḥ nirāśrayāḥ || 	The idea that the ‘eternal word’ is without a ‘maker’ has been already refuted; consequently it cannot be right that “there being no maker, there could be no defects, for which there would be no receptacle.” 
guṇebhyaḥ ca pramāṇa tvam yathā yuktam tathā uditam  | guṇānām ca aparijñāne doṣa abhāvaḥ na lakṣyate || svatas vākyam pramāṇam tad doṣa abhāva upalakṣitam | na yuktam aparijñānāt doṣa abhāvaḥ hi alakṣaṇam || 	How validity can be due to excellences has been already explained; and so long as the excellences are not recognised, the absence of defects cannot be perceived.—Thus then, it cannot be right that the assertion, valid by itself, is indicated by the absence of defects; because, not being cognised, the absence of defects cannot serve as an indicator 
nahi daṇḍa aparijñāne puṃsām daṇḍī iti lakṣyate | tat lakṣitam svatas mānam iti etat ca parāhatam || doṣa abhāvaḥ pramā abhāvāt pramāṇāt niścita ātmakaḥ | vākyasya lakṣaṇam yuktam paratas atas pramā sthitiḥ || 	Unless people know the sticks they cannot have any idea of the stick-holder. Thus the idea of the ‘self-validity’ being indicated by the absence of defects becomes discarded by self-contradiction.—The absence of defects can qualify the ‘word’ only when ascertained by that means of cognition which consists of nonapprehension; and in this way validity of a cognition would be due to something extraneous to itself.— 
nṛ doṣa viṣayam jñānam teṣu satsu upajāyate | na nāma doṣa abhāve tu guṇa ajñāne katham matiḥ || 	Even when the excellences are there, the cognition of the defects of the man do appear. if there is non-cognition of excellences, how can there be any cognition of the absence of defects? 
dveṣa moha ādayaḥ doṣāḥ kṛpā prajñā ādi bādhitāḥ | dayā ādi aniścaye teṣām asattvam hi katham gatam || 	Defects,—in the shape of hate, delusion and the like—are set aside by excellences,—in the shape of kindness, wisdom and so forth; consequently, if there is no certainty regarding these latter—kindness, etc.—How can there be any cognition of the absence of those (defects)? 
tadā na vyāpriyante tu jñāyamāna tayā guṇāḥ | doṣa abhāve tu vijñeye sattā mātra upakāriṇaḥ  | doṣa abhāve tu vijñeye sattā mātra upakāriṇaḥ  | doṣa abhāve tu vijñeye sattā mātra upakāriṇaḥ  | doṣa abhāve tu vijñeye sattā mātra upakāriṇaḥ 	At the time (of the cognition of the absence of defects), the excellences do not function on being themselves cognised; in fact, it is by mere presence that they help in the cognising of the absence, of defects”.—[Ślokavārtika 1.1.2; 67] 
yadi evam saṃśayaḥ na syāt viparyastā matiḥ tathā  | doṣāḥ santi asya naḥ vā iti santi eva iti āpta sammate || tad saṃdeha viparyāsau bhavataḥ ca atra kasyacid | yāvat guṇa gaṇa ādhāraḥ iti asau na avagamyate || 	If it were so, then, there would be no (a) doubt, nor (b) wrong cognition (misconception),—in the case of the person recognised as ‘trustworthy’—in the shape of (a) ‘are there defects in this person or not?’, and (b) ‘there are defects in him’. And yet there are such doubt and wrong cognition in some men; until it is recognised that he is the receptacle of excellences 
doṣa abhāve api atha ajñāne svataḥ prāmāṇya niścayaḥ | tathā api vimatiḥ na syāt pūrvavat tatra vaktari || 	If there were certainty regarding the self-validity (of cognitions) even when there is no cognition of the absence of defects,—then, in regard to the speaker, there could not be the ‘contrary cognition’ spoken of above (under 3045)

doṣa abhāva apramā bhāva guṇa bhāveṣu triṣu api | avaśyā abhyupagantavyā pratītiḥ niyamāt atas || 	For the above reasons, it is absolutely necessary that there should be definite cognition of all the three factors absence of defects, (2) absence of invalid cognitions and (3) presence of excellences 
sā apramāṇam pramāṇam vā iti eṣām evam vikalpyate | yathārtha niścayāya aṅgam apramāṇam katham bhavet || 	In regard to all these, there would be the two possibilities—is the cognition of these valid or invalid? how then what is itself invalid be a factor in the ascertainment of validity? 
prāmāṇye paratas prāpte tad prāmāṇya viniścayaḥ | katham vā gamyate tasyāḥ pratīteḥ sā pramā ātma tā || bādhaka pratyaya abhāvāt iti ced saḥ api kim pramā | na vā iti doṣaḥ sarvaḥ api punar atra anuvarttate || 	If the said cognition is valid, then] its certainty regarding its validity could be possible only if validity were extraneous.—How again is it ascertained that the said cognition (of the three factors) is valid?—If it be said that—“it is deduced from the absence of cognitions to the contrary”,—then the question arises—is this deduction itself valid or not?—Thus all the objections urged above come back in full force 
prāmāṇye paratas prāptā prastutasya pramāṇa tā | yathārtha jñāna hetu tvam apramāṇasya vā kutas || asya api gamyate kena prāmāṇyam iti cintyate | bādhaka pratyaya asattvāt iti aniṣṭā prasajyate || 	The validity of the cognition in question could be possible only if validity were extraneous;—how too can the invalid cognition bring about a right cognition in keeping with the reality of things? It is to be considered how the validity of this also becomes apprehended;—it may be deduced from the absence of cognitions to the contrary and so forth;—all this comes about which cannot be desirable (for the other party) 
tasmāt guṇebhyaḥ doṣāṇām abhāvaḥ tad abhāvataḥ  | apramāṇa dvaya asat tvam tena utsargaḥ anapoditaḥ  || sarvatra evam pramāṇa tvam niścitam ced iha api asau | pūrva uditaḥ doṣa gaṇaḥ prasaktā ca anavasthitiḥ || 	Thus then,—“from excellences follows the absence of defects; from this absence, there follows the absence of the two forms of invalid cognition; hence the general law remains undenied” if the validity in all cases is determined on this principle, then in the case in question also,—all the aforesaid objections become applicable; and it also involves an infinite regress 
doṣa abhāve pramā sattvam iti idam ca niṣedhanam | kevalam yadi kalpyeta tad siddhiḥ na eva sambhavet || abhāva anudupalambhena tad siddhiḥ na avakalpate | anavasthiti doṣāt ca na yukta anupalambhataḥ || 	The assertion that “there is validity when there is absence of defects” contains a negation; if this negation is meant to be absolute; then it can never be proved.—It cannot be proved by apprehension, because it is of the nature of negation;—nor can it be proved by non-apprehension, as that would involve an infinite regress 
doṣa apramā dvaya asat tā gamyate anupalambhataḥ | upalambhasya nāstitvam anyena iti anavasthitiḥ || 	If the absence of defects and that of the two kinds of invalid cognition are proved by non-apprehension,—and this absence of apprehension is proved by another non-apprehension,—then there is infinite regress

The cognition of the absence of the two kinds of invalid cognition also would turn out to be of the contrary nature. Or, in case the absence of the two kinds of invalid cognition were cognised independently by itself,—how could you secure the conviction that the rest of it is valid?—If it be urged that “the conviction is due to the pact that well-known pacts could not be explicable otherwise”,—then this

doṣāḥ santi na santi iti pauruṣeyeṣu śaṅkyate | kartuḥ vede ipi siddha tvāt doṣa āśaṅkā na nāstinaḥ || 	In the case of words emanating from personalities, there is always room for doubt whether there are defects or not; and as it has been proved that there must be an author of the Veda, it is not true that we can have no suspicion regarding the presence of defects in it 
atas yat anapekṣa tvāt vede prāmāṇyam ucyate | tat asiddham yatas saḥ api karttāram samapekṣate || 	Thus, what has been asserted regarding the validity of the Veda being self-sufficient, cannot be admitted,—because as a matter of fact, that also is dependent upon the author 
yadi saṃvādi vijñānam na vā hetu viśuddha tā  | niścitā saṃśaya utpatteḥ tadā vede na māna tā || 	In case there is no corroborative cognition, nor perfection in its source,—the appearance of doubt, and consequent invalidity, is inevitable, in the veda 
anyasya api pramāṇa tve evambhūtā eva saṅgatiḥ | kāraṇam kalpyate yasmāt niścayaḥ tad nibandhanaḥ || 	In the case of the validity of other cognitions also, such corroboration is always regarded as the ground (for validity); hence certainty must be based upon that corroboration 
sthite hi tasya māna tve niścayaḥ kriyate anayā | na tu apūrvam pramāṇa tvam anayā tasya janyate || 	It is only when the validity is there that certainty regarding it is brought about by this (confirmation), and this does not produce a fresh validity in it 
sakṛt jāta vinaṣṭe ca syāt eva arthe pramāṇa tā | aniścite api sā asti eva niścayaḥ api udita kramāt || 	In the case of the thing that is destroyed immediately on being born, validity does belong to the cognition; in fact, it is there, even in a case where there is no certainty regarding it,—the certainty appearing in the manner described 
yadi kāraṇa śuddha tva ādi jñānam niścayaḥ tatas  | yadi ca artha kriyā prāptā sākṣāt vā ādi lakṣaṇā  || yat vā abhyāsavatī vṛttiḥ nirapekṣā phala udaye | sarva upāya viyoge tu na pramāṇa viniścayaḥ || atas pramāṇa tā tasmin vidyamānā api aniścitā  | avidyamāna kalpā iti na eva asti iti apadiśyate || 	When there is cognition of the excellence of the cause and other conditions, then there follows certainty;—and also when effective action is found directly, in the share of burning, etc.;—or repeated functioning brings about the result independently.—When there is absence of all these means (of certainty), then there is no certainty at all. Thus even if validity were there, it would be uncertain,—as good as non-existent; that is why it is said that it is not present 
śrotra buddheḥ api vyaktā netra ādimatitarābhiḥ asaṅgatiḥ  | eka sāmagrī adhīnam hi rūpa śabda ādi varttate || paraspara avinirbhāgāt saṃtatyā anyonya kāraṇam  | teṣām asti eva sambandhaḥ tat evam su parisphuṭam  || tat dhiyām api tad dvārā dhūma indhana vikāra vat | śrotra dhīḥ tad pramāṇam syāt tad anyam ati saṅgateḥ 	It is not true that there can be no corroboration of auditory cognition by the eye and other means of cognition. Because colour, sound and the rest are dependent upon the same circumstances. In fact all these are mutually concomitant and, as occurring in the same ‘chain’, they are the cause of each other. Thus it is clear that there is relationship among them. Through these then there is connection among their cognitions also; just as between ‘smoke’ and ‘the effect of wet fuel’. Thus auditory cognition would be quite valid,—on account of being corroborated by other cognitions 
sādhana antara janyā tu buddhiḥ eṣā viniścitā  | hetu antara kṛta jñāna saṃvādaḥ tena vāñchyate || 	This cognition produced by other means is quite certain; that is why the corroboration by cognitions produced by other means is desired 
evam nānā indriya adhīna vijñāna antara saṅgatiḥ  | pratyakṣe kāraṇam klṛptā vede tu eṣā na dṛśyate || 	Thus, in the case of the validity of sense-perception, there is the definite basis in the form of corroboration by other cognitions produced by several sense-organs; but such is not found to be the case with the veda 
tathā hi salila jñānam ādyam utpadyate akṣi jam | pāna snāna ādi nirbhāsam jihvā kāya āśritam param || 	The first cognition of water that appears is produced by the eye; then there follows the later cognitions relating to drinking and bathing, as dependent upon the gestatory organ and the body (respectively)

It is true that the same words—“heaven is attained by the performance of agnihotra and other rites”—are heard by all men; but it is devoid of all elements of certainty,—resembling the mere croaking of frogs 
svarga ādau mata bhedaḥ ca viprāṇām api dṛśyate | labhyate na artha saṃvādaḥ tasmāt iha nara ādiṣu || 	Even among Brāhmaṇas there is difference of opinion in regard to ‘heaven’ and such things; hence the cognition derived from the Veda is not found to be the same in all men 
codanā janite jñāne dārḍhyam prāk apahastitam | saṃdigdhaḥ hi tathābhāvaḥ tad grāhyasya anya sāmyataḥ || 	As regards the firmness of the conviction produced by the Vedic injunction,—that has been already rejected; because as a matter of fact, the said firmness is always doubtful; as the matter apprehended by the said cognition is similar to others 
asarva darśibhiḥ vipraiḥ kutas etat viniścitam  | codanā janitā buddhiḥ sarva saṃvādinī iti ca || niścita ukta anumānena pratyakṣasya api māna tā  | śuddha kāraṇa janya tvāt tad pramāṇam tad anya vat || 	How have the Brāhmaṇas, who are certainly not omniscient, been able to ascertain that “the cognition produced by the Vedic injunction is the same at all places and times”? As a matter of fact, it has been already explained that the validity of perception also is ascertained by means of inference. for instance, a certain perception is valid, because it is produced by flawless causes, like other perceptions 
sarvasya ca na sādhyā iyam pramāṇa antarataḥ pramā | yasmāt artha kriyā jñāne bhrāntiḥ na asti iti sādhitam || 	The validity of all cognitions is not proved by other means of cognition; as it has been proved that there is no misconception involved in the case where there is cognition of effective action 
ātma kārya ākhya liṅgāt ca niścita avyabhicārataḥ  | jāyamāne anumāne api bhrāntiḥ asti na kācana || 	When the inference is brought about by the indicative (probans) in the shape of its nature and its effect,—the indicative whereof the ‘infallibility’ has been ascertained,—there can be no mistake in it 
kvacid tu vividha bhrānti nimitta bala bhāvinī | bhrāntiḥ utsāryate anena yasmāt tatra na niścayaḥ || 	In some cases, the mistake or illusion that arises from the various causes of illusion is set aside by another cognition; because there is no certainty in such a case 
avyakta vyaktika tvena vyaktaḥ arthaḥ na prasiddhyati  | para pratyakṣa vat tasmāt jñānam jñātam iti iṣyatām || 	There can be no ‘manifested thing’ until its manifestation has become manifested; hence it must be admitted that the cognition itself is actually cognised,—just like the sense-perception in other persons 
svayam tu jaḍa rūpa tvāt cakṣuḥ ādibhiḥ indriyaiḥ | gṛhyante viṣayāḥ na evam teṣām jñāne tu hetu tā || 	Being themselves ‘insentient’ the eye and other sense-organs do not apprehend things; they only serve as the cause of cognition of those things 
tena atra jñāyamāna tvam prāmāṇye upayujyate | viṣaya anubhavaḥ yasmāt ajñātaḥ na eva labhyate || 	Thus then, the fact of being cognised is of great use in the matter of the validity of cognitions; because there can be no apprehension of things which is not itself cognised 
etāvat tu bhavet atra grahaṇe api sva saṃvidaḥ | bhrānti kāraṇa sadbhāvāt tathātve na viniścayaḥ || tadā ca artha tayā bhāvaḥ api asmāt na eva avasīyate | sādṛśyāt upalambhena tad anya āropa sambhavāt || 	Even in the cognition of itself by itself, there is this fact that there can be no certainty regarding its validity, on account of the possibility of causes of misconception being present, consequently it is not ascertained that what is cognised is a real entity; because mere apprehension can also be due to similarity, and there is always the possibility of the imposition (misconception) of something else 
ābhyāsikam yathā jñānam pramāṇam gamyate svatas  | mithyājñānam tathā kiṃcid apramāṇam svatas sthitam || 	Just as repeated cognition is regarded as valid by itself,—so also in some cases wrong cognition is invalid by itself 
bādha kāraṇa duṣṭa tva jñāne api uktā anavasthitiḥ  | tāvatā tasya mithyā tvam grahītum tat na pāryate || 	It has been already explained that the idea of falsity of the cognition being ‘due to the presence of sublating cognitions and to the cognition of its source being defective’ involves infinite regress. Hence the falsity (invalidity) cannot be recognised merely on the basis of the said cognitions 
utpatti avastham eva idam pramāṇam iti mīyate | na tāvat avikalpa tvāt aniṣṭeḥ ca ātma saṃvidaḥ || na api jñāna antareṇa eva tad kāle asannidhānataḥ | tasya api avyakta bhāva tvāt aniṣṭa āpattitaḥ api vā || 	It cannot be recognised that it is valid at the time that it appears;—because it is non-conceptual and because self-cognition is not admitted.—Nor can it be recognised by another cognition; because it is not there at the time; also because its presence is not manifested; or because of an undesirable contingency 
vede pi bādhakam mānam uktam eva anumā ātmakam | tad ukta ātma ādi apohena tasmāt mānam na yujyate || pauruṣeya tva siddheḥ ca śaṅkyā duṣṭa nimitta tā | vahneḥ iva svatas śaktiḥ mithyā jñāneṣu vā bhavet || codanā prabhavam jñānam atas duṣṭa nimittakam | śaṅkyate dṛṣṭa doṣāt ca śaṅkya doṣam na bhidyate || 	In connection with the Veda, it has been already pointed out that there is a sublating cognition in the form of inference; hence by the rejection of the ‘soul’ and other things mentioned in the Veda, it becomes established that the cognition derived from the veda cannot be valid.—As it has been proved that the Veda is the work of a personal author, the fact of its having a defective source is always open to suspicion.—If the capacity in question (i.e. validity) were inherent in cognitions, just as the capacity to burn is inherent in fire,—then such validity should belong to wrong cognitions also.—Thus it is open to suspicion that the cognition provided by the Veda proceeds from a defective source, and what is suspected to be defective does not differ from what is actually perceived to be defective 
tasmāt svataḥ pramāṇa tvam vedasya api na yujyate | tena niścita nirdoṣa kṛta ākhyāta tvam iṣyatām || 	For these reasons ‘self-sufficient validity’ is not possible in the Veda also; consequently please accept the view that the Veda has been composed and expounded by persons who are definitely recognised as free from defects

sarve ca yasya puruṣāḥ deśa kālau tathā akhilau | kara āmalaka vat vyaktam vartante adhyakṣa cetasi || sa pāṭhasya api tulya tvam boddhum śaktaḥ anyathā punar  | deśa kāla nara avasthā bhedena vimatiḥ katham || 	That the verbal text has remained the same can be ascertained only by a person to whom all men, and all times and places are visible like the fruit in the hand; if it were not so, then, why should there have been a difference of opinion due to the divergence of time, place, persons and circumstances? 
jagat sadā īdṛśam ca iti na pramāṇam iha api vaḥ | na yuktā adṛṣṭi mātreṇa saṃvartasya api nāsti tā || 	You have no proof for the notion that the world has always been as it is now. The existence of the ‘saṃvarta’ (dissolution) also cannot be denied simply because it is not seen 
svatas prāmāṇya pakṣe tu niścayam kurute svatas  | vedaḥ svārtha svarūpe ca tat na moha ādi sambhavaḥ || atas ca ajñāna saṃdeha viparyāsa a pade sthite  | na upadeśam apekṣeta dvija potaḥ api kaścana  || yathā ca ajñāta mūlasya na vināśaḥ api sambhavī | kaḥ vā vināśaḥ nityasya bhavet vajra atiśāyinaḥ || abhivyakti anyathātvam ced nitye sā nanu apākṛtā  | atas rakṣām api prājñāḥ niṣphalām asya kurvate 	Under the view that the validity of cognitions is inherent in them, certainty of conviction must be regarded as brought about by the Veda by itself, in regard to its own form (text); hence there can be no possibility of delusion in respect to that.—Thus, there being no room for ignorance, or doubt, or misconception,—even the infant of the Brāhmaṇa should not require any teaching.—Just as there is no possibility of the destruction of the thing whose root (cause) is unknown,—how could there be any destruction (mutilation) of what is eternal and superior even to the diamond (in its indestructibility)?—If it be said that “there may be destruction in the shape of perversion of the manifestation”,—then the answer is that the possibility of such manifestation of what is eternal has been already rejected.—Hence if wise people seek to preserve the vedic text, the attempt is entirely superfluous 
atīndriya artha dṛś tasmāt vidhūta antaḥ tamaḥ cayaḥ  | veda artha pravibhāga jñaḥ karttā ca abhyupagamyatām || 	For these reasons please accept the view that there has been an author of the Veda,—one who is capable of seeing things beyond the senses, who has shaken off the entire mass of darkness and ignorance, and who is conversant with the meaning of the Veda and its divisions 
atīndriya artha dṛś tasmāt vidhūta antaḥ tamaḥ cayaḥ  | veda artha pravibhāga jñaḥ karttā ca abhyupagamyatām || 	For these reasons please accept the view that there has been an author of the Veda,—one who is capable of seeing things beyond the senses, who has shaken off the entire mass of darkness and ignorance, and who is conversant with the meaning of the Veda and its divisions 
dharma jña tva niṣedhaḥ ced kevalaḥ atra upayujyate | sarvam anyat vijānānaḥ puruṣaḥ kena vāryate || 	All that is pertinent to the present context is the denial of the knowledge of dharma (by man); who is denying the possibility of a person knowing other things?”

padārthāḥ yaiḥ ca yāvantaḥ sarva tvena avadhāritāḥ | tad jña tvena api sarvajñāḥ sarve tad grantha vedinaḥ || 	When certain people have come to the conclusion that such and so many are all the things that exist,—all those who know this and those who have learnt the works written by them should be ‘all-knowing’.” 
tathā ṣaḍbhiḥ pramāṇaiḥ yaḥ ṣaṣ prameya vivekavān | saḥ api saṃkṣipta sarvajñaḥ kasya nāma na saṃmataḥ || 	For instance, one who has knowledge of the six ‘objects of cognition’, through the six ‘means of cognition’, would be ‘knowing all’ in an epitomised form; who is there who would not admit such an omniscient person?” 
viśeṣeṇa tu sarva artha sākṣāt pratyakṣa darśinam | yaḥ kalpayati tasya asau mudhā mithyā ca kalpanā || 	If one assumes the existence of a person capable of directly perceiving all things in detail,—such assumption is absolutely futile and false.”

samasta avayava vyakti vistara jñāna sādhanam | kākadanta parīkṣā vat kriyamāṇam anarthakam || 	If an attempt were made to prove that one has the knowledge of the details of all individuals and components of the whole world,—it would be as futile as the investigation of the crow’s teeth.” 
yathā ca cakṣuṣā sarvān bhāvān vetti iti niṣphalam | sarva pratyakṣa darśi tva pratijñā api aphalā tathā || 	Just as the assertion that ‘one knows all things with his eyes’ is futile, so also would be the proposition that ‘there is a person capable of directly perceiving all things’.”

The man who assumes the existence of an omniscient person knowing all things through a single means of cognition may certainly apprehend all such things as taste, odour, etc. through the eyes alone.” 
yad jātīyaiḥ pramāṇaiḥ tu yad jātīya artha darśanam | dṛṣṭam samprati lokasya tathā kāla antare api abhūt || 	As a matter of fact, the perception of certain things through certain causes in the past was exactly as it is found to appear at the present time.”

śrotra gamyeṣu śabdeṣu dūra sūkṣma upalabdhibhiḥ | puruṣa atiśayaḥ dṛṣṭaḥ na rūpa ādi upalambhanāt || cakṣuṣā api ca dūra stha sūkṣma rūpa prakāśanam | kriyate atiśaya prāptyā na tu śabda ādi darśanam || 	As a matter of fact, in the matter of the auditory perception of sounds, superiority among men is found in the apprehending of distant and subtle sounds,—not in the apprehending of colour and other things. Similarly in the matter of visual perception, what is brought about by the attainment of superiority is the perception of remote and subtle colour,—not the perception of sound and other things.”

daśa hasta antaram vyomnaḥ yaḥ nāma utplutya gacchati | na yojanam asau gantum śaktaḥ abhyāsa śataiḥ api || 	The man, who can jump into the sky to the height of 15 feet, can never jump to the height of eight miles,—however much he may practise jumping.” 
tasmāt atiśaya jñānaiḥ ati dūra gataiḥ api | kiñcid eva adhikam jñātum śakyate na tu atīndriyam || 	Thus then, even when the superiority of knowledge proceeds very far, it can comprehend only a little more than others,—it can never comprehend things beyond the senses.”

Those things again which are separated from one another by intervening lands, hills and oceans, countries, continents and islands,—who can perceive all these when seated in one place?”

anāgatena dṛṣṭam ca pratyakṣasya manāk api | sāmarthyam na anumāna ādi janma liṅga ādibhiḥ vinā || 	Sense-perception has never been found to possess the capacity to apprehend future things; and as for inference and other forms of cognition, these can never come about without the indicative and other factors.” 
tasmāt atīndriya arthānām sākṣāt draṣṭā na vidyate | vacanena tu nityena yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati || 	Thus then, there can be no one who perceives things beyond the reach of the senses; he alone knows such things who knows them through the eternal word.”

How can both these notions be established without some other well-known basis?” 
a sarvajña praṇītāt tu vacanāt mūla varjitāt | sarvajñam avagacchantaḥ sva vākyāt kim na jāyana te || 	When people admit of the omniscient person on the basis of the baseless assertions of persons who are not omniscient, why cannot they derive the same knowledge from their own words?” 
sarvajñāḥ bahavaḥ kalpyāḥ ca eka sarvajña siddhaye | yaḥ eva ekaḥ api asarvajñaḥ sa sarvajñam na buddhyate || 	For the proving of the existence of one omniscient person, it would be necessary to assume several omniscient persons; and if a single one of these happen to be not-omniscient, he would not be able to recognise the omniscient person.”

sarva śiṣyaiḥ api jñātān arthān saṃvādayan api | na sarvajñaḥ bhavet anya loka jñāta artha varjanāt || na ca sarva nara jñāta jñeya saṃvāda sambhavaḥ | kāla traya tri loka sthaiḥ naraiḥ na ca samāgamaḥ || 	Even if a person were to comprehend the things known to all his disciples, he would not be ‘omniscient’; as he would be devoid of the comprehension of the things known to people other than those disciples.—Nor is it possible to comprehend all the things cognised by all men; as there can be no coming together of men of the past, present and future, inhabiting all the three regions of the world.”

Through the art of chiromancy, some people are able to know what has been eaten, what is being thought of, what lies within a man’s fist and so forth,—though they are entirely devoid of any knowledge of dharma and cognate matters. Similarly, people expert in the arts of illusion, magic, etc. deceive an ignorant man;—by which they appear to be omniscient.”

yat vā ātmani eva tat jñānam dhyāna abhyāsa pravartitam | tasya eva apratighātena jñāna apratigha tā ucyate || 	Or, the knowledge spoken of may be that of his own ‘self’—brought about by the practice of meditation; as such knowledge would never be obstructed, it is spoken of as ‘untrammelled’.” 
jñānam vairāgyam aiśvaryam iti yaḥ api daśa avyayaḥ | śaṃkaraḥ śrūyate saḥ api jñānavān ātma vid tayā || 	When Śaṅkara is spoken of as equipped with ‘ten imperishable qualities’ in the shape of knowledge, dispassion, supreme power and so forth,—he also is ‘possessed of knowledge’ only in the sense of knowing his own self.” 
etat eva hi tat jñānam yat viśuddha ātma darśanam | aśuddhe tad nimitte ca yat tat ajñānam ucyate || 	His knowledge consists only in the direct perception of his pure self; when the source of that knowledge is not pure, the knowledge itself is called ‘ignorance’.”

Where, on one side are the mortal men, Buddha and the rest,—and where on the other, are the said three superior deities? Hence the idea that the former, in rivalry to the latter, are also omniscient,—is sheer delusion” 
nitye api ca āgame vede brahma ādi traya kīrttanam | tad nitya tvāt ca vedānām nitya tvam na vihanyate || 	There is mention of the three deities, Brahmā, etc., in the Veda, which is eternal; and yet the eternality of the Vedas does not become impaired; because Brahmā and the rest are themselves eternal.” 
te hi nityaiḥ guṇaiḥ nityam karmabhiḥ ca samanvitāḥ  | nitya veda abhidhāyi tva sambhavāt na virodhinaḥ || anityasya tu buddha ādeḥ na nitya āgama gamya tā | nitya tve ca āgamasya iṣṭe vṛthā sarvajña kalpanā || 	They are equipped with eternal qualities and eternal functions; hence there is no incongruity in these being mentioned in the eternal Veda.—On the other hand, Buddha, etc. are perishable beings, hence it is not possible for them to be mentioned in the eternal scripture. And when the scripture is held to be eternal, the assuming of the omniscient person is entirely futile.” 
sarvajña jñāpanāt tasya varam dharma avabodhanam | veda bodhita sarvajña jñānāt dharmāt tirohitāt || atirohita dharma ādi jñānam eva viśeṣyate | evam āgama gamya tvam na sarvajñasya labhyate || 	Rather than admit the idea of the scripture indicating the omniscient person, it is far better to accept the idea that it indicates dharma. Because the clear knowledge of dharma (directly from the Veda) is superior to the unclear knowledge derived indirectly through the knowledge of the omniscient person mentioned in the Veda.—Thus it cannot be maintained that the omniscient person is spoken of in the scriptures.” 
sarvajña sadṛśaḥ kaścid yadi dṛśyeta samprati | tadā gamyeta sarvajña sadbhāvaḥ upamā balāt || 	If any person similar to the omniscient person were seen at the present time, then alone could the existence of the omniscient person be cognised on the strength of analogy.”

anyathā api upapanna tvāt na artha āpattiḥ iyam kṣamā  | ataeva anumā api eṣā na sādhuḥ vyavatiṣṭhate || upadeśaḥ hi buddha ādeḥ anyathā api upapadyate | svapna ādi dṛṣṭaṣṭaṃvyāmohāt vedāt vād icca avitatha thaṃśrutāt 	As the fact is capable of another explanation, the presumption (put forward) has no efficacy (in proving the existence of the omniscient person). For the same reason, the inference that has been put forward is not valid. for instance, the fact of Buddha and others having taught dharma, etc. can be explained in another way—For instance, as being due to dreams, or to delusion, or to the Veda itself, or to wrong teaching.” 
ye hi tāvat aveda jñāḥ teṣām vedāt asambhavaḥ | upadeśa kṛtaḥ yaḥ taiḥ vyāmohāt eva kevalāt || śiṣya vyāmohana artham vā vyāmohāt vā a tad āśrayāt | loke duṣṭa upadeṣṭṛṇām upadeśaḥ pravarttate || 	Those who are ignorant of the Veda cannot have their teaching based upon the Veda; it can proceed from delusion only. in the world the teachings that are propounded by wicked teachers are not based upon the Veda; they proceed either from delusion or for the purpose of duping the disciples.”

ye tu manu ādayaḥ siddhāḥ prādhānyena trayīvidām | trayīvid āśrita granthāḥ te veda prabhava uktayaḥ || 	As regards Manu and others, who are well-known among Vedic scholars, and whose compilations are accepted by Vedic scholars,—their assertions have their source in the Veda.”

In fact these assertions do not represent what is meant to be proved. There is no purpose in proving what is asserted in the above form,” “By proving some omniscient person in general, you cannot get at that particular person whose omniscience you are asserting for the purpose of establishing the truthfulness of his word.” “So long as Buddha is not proved to be omniscient, his words remain false (unreliable). How can the truthfulness of Buddha be established by the proving of some omniscient person in general?” 
anyasmin ahi sarvajñe vacasaḥ anyasya satya tā  | sāmānādhikaraṇye hi tayoḥ aṅga aṅgi tā bhavet || 	The omniscience of one person cannot establish the truthfulness of the word of another person. It is only when the two are co-substrate—that they support one another.”

We now proceed to consider why the omniscient person has been postulated?—Your omniscient person—does he apprehend all things by a single cognition? Or by several cognitions? And then, does he apprehend them all at once? Or in succession—noticing only the more important things? In no case has it been seen that a single cognition apprehends such contradictory things as pure and impure and so forth; nor have several divergent cognitions been found to appear at one and the same time.—Who too is there who could apprehend, even in hundreds of years, each of the endless number of things, past, present and future?—Even if the person, by his own undiversified nature, apprehends all things,—he cannot apprehend the specific individualities of all things. Under the circumstances, what would be the use of the omniscient person who knows the things only in their general form? Specially as in no other form is the thing apprehended.—Then again, this uniform cognition could be either true or false.—If it be held to be true, then this would be contrary to perceived facts; as it would mean that all is one, without a second; and the result of this would be that there would be no such diverse entities as the disciple, the omniscient person, dharma, adharma, and the teachings of the said person; as the distinctive features of these would not be cognised.—If the one uniform cognition be held to be false, the omniscient person turns out to be a deluded person; so that no confidence should be reposed in his words, which are like the words of demented and intoxicated men.—If then the omniscient person is held to be that person who apprehends all things and their causes, through a single abnormal cognition brought about by communion,—then there can be no means of cognition to vouch for his existence,—in the shape of perception or inference or word, that is not produced by that person himself. Hence the conclusion would be that such a person does not exist.—Whether simultaneously or successively, how could there be any inference without an effect?—As a matter of fact, a certain person can either have no potency at all, or if he has, then he would have all potencies; so that all beings would be able to have the cognition of all things. And yet as a matter of fact, wanting in the necessary means, people do not cognise all things.—The idea that ‘there is one person who has acquired special powers not common among men, and he knows all things’—is entirely baseless.—Thus then, no omniscient person of any kind is conceivable. Consequently no human assertion could be the means of providing the knowledge of dharma.” Thus have the Mīmāṃsakas argued, being firm believers in the self-sufficiency of the Veda.—But we have already proved in detail that the Veda is the work of a person.—Hence the conclusion is irresistible that there is a person who has the direct knowledge of all things; and no one can know things by means of the eternal word, which is an impossibility 
nityasya vacasaḥ śaktiḥ na svatas vā api na anyatas  | sva artha jñāne samutpādye krama akrama virodhataḥ || 	The ‘eternal word’ can never have the capacity to bring about the cognition of its own meaning;—because there is incompatibility between ‘succession’ and ‘simultaneity’

In fact, under your view also the author of the Veda would be such a person capable of perceiving supersensuous things;—or a person who knows all about primordial matter, spirit and other things; or one who knows of all things.—In fact, if such an author were not 
kiñca akāraṇam eva idam uktam ājñā majña prabhāviṣitam  | keśa romāṇi yāvanti kasmāni jñātum arhati || yasmāt nirmala niṣkampa jñāna dīpena kaścana | dyotita akhila vastuḥ syāt iti atra uktam na bādhakam || 	Further, what has been asserted—as to the impossibility of any one knowing all hairs and nails, etc.—is without any basis, due entirely to ignorance; because it is quite possible that there may be some one for whom all things become manifested by the clear and unflinching light of knowledge and no reason has been adduced against such possibility 
na ca api adṛṣṭi mātreṇa tad asat tā viniścayaḥ | hetu vyāpaka tā yogāt upalambhasya vastuṣu || 	Mere ‘non-apprehension’ cannot prove his non-existence. because apprehension is neither the ‘cause’ nor the ‘pervader’ of things

tena adṛṣṭi viśeṣa uttham kāraṇa vyāpaka ātmanām | prakṛtyāḥ dṛśya rūpa tvāt sarvajñasya na sidhyati || 	As a matter of fact, any ‘non-apprehension’—in the case of things of the nature of the ‘pervader’, the ‘cause’ and the ‘nature’ of the omniscient person—would not be operative, because by his very nature, he is imperceptible 
iyam ca trividhā dṛṣṭiḥ viśva nava rūpā pravarttate | tad tad viruddha ādya gati gati bheda prayogataḥ || mūla prabheda rūpāyāḥ asyāḥ sarva vidam prati | sādhite śakti vaikalye vyastāḥ anyāḥ ayatnataḥ || 	This ‘non-apprehension’ proceeds in nine ways: due to its being put forward in diverse ways consisting of the non-cognition and cognition of the said three and their contraries (respectively). And when in its very basic form, the ‘non-apprehension’ has been shown to be inapplicable to the omniscient person, the others become set aside without much effort 
kārya kāraṇa tā vyāpya vyāpaka tva virodhitāḥ  | dṛśya tve sati siddhyanti yaḥ ca ātmā sa viśeṣaṇaḥ || sarvajñaḥ na ca dṛśyaḥ te tena na etāḥ adṛṣṭayaḥ | tad nirākaraṇe śaktāḥ niṣedha aṅgam na ca aparam || 	Effect and cause, pervaded and pervader, and contrariness—all these,—as also the ‘nature’ of the thing with a qualification—are possible only when the thing is perceptible.—The omniscient person, however, is not perceptible for you; hence all these ‘non-apprehensigns’ are not capable of proving his nonexistence; and any other factor of negation, there is none, 
yadi tvadṛṣṭi mātreṇa sarva vid pratiṣidhyate | tadā mātṛ vivāha ādi niṣedhaḥ api bhavet tava || 	If the omniscient person is denied on the ground of mere ‘non-apprehension’,—then you might also deny the marriage of your own mother and such other facts 
suta ākhya kārya dṛṣṭyā ced hetoḥ tasya astitā gatiḥ | tad abhāve api tat kāryam nanu kasyāñcid īkṣate || 	If it be urged that—“on seeing the effect in the form of the son, there is cognition of the cause of that effect”,—then (the answer is that) in certain cases, the effect is found in the absence of the cause in question 
anya upalambhataḥ tasya na asat tā gamyate yadi | nanu ca anya upalambhaḥ te siddhaḥ tad viṣayaḥ katham || 	If it is said that—“the non-existence of the marriage is not cognised, because other people know of it then (the answer is) how do you know that other people know of it? 
upadeśāt na sarvajñe api ayam kim vidyate tathā | idam ca sva uktam aparam kim atra na samīkṣyate || sarvadā ca eva purūṣāḥ prāyeṇa anṛta vādinaḥ | yathā ādya tve na vistrambhaḥ tathā atīta artha kīrtane || 	We know it from the assertion (of other persons)”.—Then (the answer is) is there not such assertion in regard to the omniscient person also?—Then again, how is it that you do not recall another assertion of yours to the effect that—“men are always found to be liars”? And just as there can be no confidence in the words of men regarding present things, so also there can be none in the words speaking of past things 
mā vā abhūt upadeśaḥ asya prāmāṇyam vā tathā api vaḥ | kṛtaḥ ayam niścayaḥ sarvaiḥ sarva vid na upalabhyate || evam hi niścayaḥ hi syāt sarva sattva ātma darśane | tad dṛṣṭau sarva vid bhūtaḥ bhavān iti ca varṇitam || 	Or, there may be no such assertion (regarding the existence of the omniscient person); nor may such assertion be reliable; even so, you have come to the certainty that “the omniscient person is not apprehended by any man”; and such certainty could be possible only if the souls of all men were known to you; and if all these were known to you, then you yourself would be omniscient,—as has been pointed out above 
anyathā saṃśayaḥ yuktaḥ anupalambhe api sattva vat | kecid sarva vidaḥ santaḥ vidanti iti hi saṅkyate || svayam eva ātmanā ātmānam ātma jyotiḥ sa paśyati | iti api āśaṅkyate atas ca sarva adṛṣṭiḥ aniścitā || 	If it were not so, then, even on non-apprehension, there would be doubt only (regarding the existence of the omniscient person),—just as there is regarding the existence of certain things.—There are some saintly persons too who are believed to have knowledge of the omniscient person—it is also conceivable that the omniscient person, being self-luminous, perceives himself by himself.—For these reasons there can be no certainty regarding the non-apprehension of the omniscient person by all men 
tathā hi sarva śabdena sarve prāṇabhṛtaḥ matāḥ | sa ca sarva abahis bhūtaḥ iti adṛṣṭiḥ aniścitā || 	Because the term ‘all’ stands for all living beings; and the person himself must be included in ‘all’; hence there can be no certainty regarding the non-apprehension (of the omniscient person) 
tad eka parihāreṇa pratibandhaḥ atra kaḥ bhavet | na hi anyaiḥ aparijñānāt sva rāga ādi nivarttate || 	By the exclusion of that one person alone, what connection could there be (of this with the non-existence of the omniscient person)? One’s own illness does not cease merely because other people do not know of it

For instance, the proof of the momentary character of the veda, the earth and other things though clearly stated by us, has not been understood by dull-witted men. Consequently, the matter is open to doubt and the absence of apprehension cannot be certain,—simply because some people are sure that they! perceive his non-existence 
abhāve api anumānasya na atas asattā viniścayaḥ | asamārabdha dhūma ādi kārya vahni ādi sattva vat || 	Even if there be no inference, that alone cannot bring, about certainty regarding non-existence (of the omniscient person); as in the case of the existence of the fire which has not yet begun to emit its effect in the shape of smoke 
kadācid upalabdhe arthe sandehaḥ nanu yujyate  | yathā sthāṇau tathā hi eṣaḥ ubhaya aṃśa avalambakaḥ || yatas sthāṇu narau dṛṣṭau kadācid iti tad gatiḥ  | saṃśayaḥ yujyate tatra dṛṣṭaḥ tu evam na sarva vid || 	In the case of a thing that has been apprehended at some time or the other, it is possible that there may be doubt; as for instance, in the case of the post, which partakes of the nature of both factors (of the doubt); because the post and the man have both been seen somewhere, therefore it is possible that there should be doubt as to its being this or that. The omniscient person, however, has never been thus perceived.” 
nanu mātṛ vivāha ādeḥ asat tvam mukta saṃśayam | etena eva prakāreṇa tava dhīman prasajyate || 	In this manner, o clever man, the non-existence of your mother’s marriage becomes established ‘free from all doubt’ 
asmābhiḥ saṃśayaḥ tu atra pramā bhāve api varṇyate | bhāve abhāve ca vastūnām pramāṇa vinivṛttitaḥ || 	We hold that there is doubt also when there is no valid cognition; it arises in regard to existence as well as non-existence, from the absence of the operation of any of the means of right cognition 
netra ādīnām hi vaikalye vastu sattve api na pramā | teṣām avikala tve api vastu abhāvāt haṭa ādi vat || tatas ca anupalambhasya kevalasya dvidhā īkṣaṇāt | tad pramā bhāvataḥ api astu sarvajñe saṃśayaḥ varam || 	When there is a defect in the eye, there is no cognition, even though the thing is there; and even when the eye is free from defects, there is no cognition, because the thing is not there;—as in the case of things like the jar.—Thus, inasmuch as mere non-apprehension (absence of cognition) is found in both cases, it is far better to hold that it is doubt that arises from the non-apprehension of the omniscient person 
sa hi san api na īkṣyeta jaḍaiḥ anya vikalpavat  | sākṣāt ayaḥ guḍa aṅgāra āra vahvi vat na ca kārya kṛt  || tat kāryam vā yadā adṛśyam anya kalpaja rāga vat | kārye dṛśye api vā tena na anvayaḥ asya pratīyate  || sarva artha jñaḥ yatas adṛśyaḥ sadā eva jaḍa dhī dṛśām | na atas anumānataḥ tasya sattā siddhim prayāsyati  || ahetu avyāpakam ca uktam pramāṇam vastunaḥ asya ca  | nivṛttau asya bhāvaḥ api dṛṣṭaḥ tena api saṃśayaḥ 	Though existent, he would not be seen directly by dull-witted persons; just like the conceptions of other people. Nor is he constantly active, just as the fire in the iron-ball is not active. Even when there, his activity would not be perceptible, like the feeling of love arising in others out of their fancies. Even if his activity would be perceptible, his connection with such action would not be cognised because the person knowing all things is always imperceptible for people whose eye of cognition is dull. It is for this reason that his existence cannot be proved by means of inference. It has been already explained that there can be no ‘cause’ or ‘pervader’ in his case. And yet it has been seen that even when the inference of the thing is not possible, the thing does exist. Thus it is that the matter (of the non-existence of the omniscient person) remains in doubt 
tasmāt sarvajña sadbhāva bādhakam na asti kiñcana | pramāṇam sādhakam tu asya vistareṇa abhidhāsyate || 	Thus, then, there is nothing that can set aside the existence of the omniscient person; the proof in support of his existence is going to be adduced later on 
niḥśeṣa artha parijñāna sādhane viphale api ca | sudhiyaḥ saugatāḥ yatnam kurvanti anyena cetasā || 	It is with a totally different motive that the wise Buddhists make an attempt to establish the knowledge of all things,—even though such attempt prove futile 
svarga apavarga samprāpti hetu jñaḥ usti iti gamyate | sākṣāt na kevalam kintu sarvajñaḥ pi pratīyate || 	What is primarily and directly understood by us is that there is a person who knows the means of attaining heaven and liberation;—but not this alone; it is also believed that there is a person who also knows all things 
tatas ca bādhaka abhāve sādhane sati ca sphuṭe | kasmāt vipratipadyante sarvajñe jaḍa buddhayaḥ || mā abhūt vā sādhanam tatra bādhake tu aviniścite | saṃśayaḥ syāt ayam tveṣām niścayaḥ kiṃnibandhanaḥ || 	Thus then, there being no reasons against, while there is clear reason in support of it,—why should dull-witted persons object to the idea of the omniscient person? Even if there be no proof in support of it,—so long as there is no reason definitely against it,—the matter should remain in doubt; on what could this certainty of these people be based? 
bhūta ādi bodhane śaktā codanā eva aparam na tu  | iti ayam niyamaḥ yuktaḥ hi anya asattve viniścite || 	The assertion that—“the Veda alone—and nothing else—is able to provide knowledge of the past, etc.—could be true only if the non-existence of the other sources were certain

sarva pramātṛ sambaddha pratyakṣa ādi anivāraṇāt | kevala āgama gamya tvam na āpyate puṇya pāpayoḥ || etāvatā ca mīmāṃsā pakṣe asiddhe api yaḥ punar | sarvajña vāraṇe yatnaḥ saḥ ati saukhya amaurkhyāt paraiḥ kṛtaḥ || 	As perception and other means of cognition regarding the omniscient person cannot be discarded, it does not follow that morality and immorality are cognisable through the reliable word only 
ye tu avicchinna mūla tvāt dharma jña tve ahate sati | sarvajñān puruṣān āhuḥ dhīmat tā taiḥ prakāśitā || 	The ‘person cognisant of dharma’ not being refuted, on account of the root not being cut off,—if people have asserted the existence of omniscient persons they have shown their wisdom by this 
rasana indriya sambandhāt madya aśuci rasa ādayaḥ  | vedyeḥ anyadi tasya eva tadānīm nindya tā bhavet || bhūta artha bhāvanā udbhūta mānasena eva cetasā | aprāptāḥ eva vedyante ninditāḥ api saṃvṛtau || 	If the omniscient person had experienced the unclean taste, etc. through the contact of his gestatory organ, then alone could he be regarded as blameworthy. As a matter of fact however, things,—even those that are deprecated under ‘illusion’,—become cognised by him without actual contact, through the mind, whose perceptiveness has been brought about by the impressions of past experiences 
yatas eva na veda ādi prokta artha pratipādakam | tāyinaḥ dṛśyate vākyam tatas eva sa sarva vid || sambhāvyate samasta asat tīrthyā asādhāraṇa sthitiḥ | pramāda adhītam ātma ādi vede alīkam bravīti hi || 	It is because ho word of tāyin are found to provide knowledge of things mentioned in the Veda, that he is ‘omniscient it is quite possible too that he had knowledge of all false philosophical doctrines also; as he does make the declaration that what is asserted in the Veda regarding the soul and other things is wrong 
advitīyam śiva dvāram kudṛṣṭīnām bhayaṅkaram | vinaneyebhyaḥ hitāya uktam nairātmyam tena tu sphuṭam || 	The doctrine of ‘no-soul’ has been clearly taught by him for the benefit of his disciples—the doctrine which is the unique gateway to the highest good, and the fright of all upholders of wrong doctrines 
saṃsāri anucitam jñātam sarva anartha nivartakam | tad abhyāsa ādi yuktānām guṇa ratna ākaram param || īdṛś ca paramam tattvam jānanti kavayaḥ yadi | pradhāna puruṣa artha jñān sarvajñān kaḥ na manyate || 	It is not known to the worldly man; when known, it sets aside all evil; for those who are devoted to its practice, it is a veritable mine of valuable qualities. If the poets know this highest truth, then who is there who would not regard them, knowing the primordial matter, the spirit and other things, as omniscient? 
idam ca varddhamāna ādeḥ nairātmya jñānam īdṛśam  | na samasti ātma dṛṣṭau hi vinaṣṭāḥ sarva tīrthikāḥ  || syāt vāda akṣaṇika syātva ādi pratyakṣa ādi prabobādhitam  | bahu eva ayuktam uktam yaiḥ syuḥ sarvajñāḥ katham nu te || vāhīka ādi prasiddhe asmin pratyakṣe arthe skhalanti ye | katham sambhāvyate teṣām atyakṣa adhigamaḥ sphuṭaḥ  || asarvajña tvam evam tu a praspaṣṭam avagamyate | mithyājñāna anuṣaṅgi tvāt viparīta prakā 	This knowledge of the doctrine of ‘no-soul’ as described does not belong to vardhamāna and others; in fact, all philosophers have become lost in the doctrine of the ‘soul’,—all such doctrines as the ‘syādvāda’ and others involving the notions of things being not-momentary, are discarded by direct perception; how then can persons who have asserted' many such unreasonable things be ‘omniscient’? People who tremble over things that are perceptible and known even to the ploughman,—how could they ever have any clear knowledge of things that are beyond the senses? Thus the fact of these persons being not-omniscient is clearly understood from their being attached to wrong doctrines and expounding wrong teachings; just in the same way as any other man who perceives the man in the post is said to be mistaken.—One is to be recognised as omniscient only when he has been found to satisfy all tests and all reasons, and has been found to have the true knowledge of all things.—Thus then our reason should not be regarded as being one whose contrary is open to doubt 
ābhiprāyikam eteṣām syāt vāda ādi vacaḥ yadi | tāttvikam sarva vastūnām kim ebhiḥ rūpam iṣyate || 	If the assertion of these teachers regarding the ‘syādvāda’ and other doctrines be said to have been made with some (other) motive,—then (we ask)—what is that form of things which they hold to be real and true? 
anātma kṣaṇika tva ādi yadi evam sarva darśinaḥ | sākṣāt samasta vastūnām tattva rūpasya darśanāt || santu te pi samastānām aikamatyena saṃsthiteḥ | paraspara viruddha artham nīta artham na hi te jaguḥ || 	There is no soul;—things are momentary and so forth.”—If that is so, these teachers are omniscient; because they have directly perceived the true nature of all things. In that case they are all omniscient, holding the same view of things. As for the mutually contradictory teachings, they never expounded any such teachings,—they meant something quite different 
pratipādita rūpasya sarva vastu gatasya ca | sākṣāt tattvasya vijñānāt sugatāḥ sarva darśinaḥ || teṣām ca evaṃvidhe jñāne sugata tvam na bhidyate | praśasta jñāna yogi tvāt etāvat tasya lakṣaṇam || 	The Buddhas are omniscient only because they have the direct knowledge of truth regarding all things, as explained above. If then this same knowledge belongs to the other teachers also, then they also are ‘Buddhas’ and their ‘Buddha-hood’ does not differ from that of the Buddha; because they also possess perfect knowledge, and this is the sole characteristic of the Buddha 
tad sambhavī api sarvajñaḥ sāmānyena prasādhitaḥ | tad lakṣaṇa avinābhāvāt sugataḥ vyavatiṣṭhate || 	Thus, though the omniscient person whose existence has been proved is only such a person in general, yet in reality, it is Buddha alone who stands out as the only such person; as it is only he in whom all the characteristics of the omniscient person are present 
anirdiṣṭa viśeṣaḥ api sarvajñaḥ kaḥ api sambhavet | yaḥ yathāvat jagat sarvam vetti anātma ādi rūpataḥ || 	Even when one is specifically singled out, that person alone could be omniscient who knows the whole world in its real form of ‘being without soul’ and the rest 
pratyakṣīkṛta nairātmye na doṣaḥ labhate sthitim | tad viruddha tayā dīpre pradīpe timiram yathā || 	When one has perceived the fact of there being no soul,—no defect can obtain a footing in him; because it is its contradictory. Just as when the bright lamp is there, there can be no darkness 
sākṣātkṛti viśeṣāt ca doṣaḥ na asti sa vāsanaḥ | sarvajña tvam atas siddham sarva āvaraṇa muktitaḥ || 	Also, on account of the peculiar character of the direct perception, the defect along with the dispositions ceases forthwith; and thus through freedom from all ‘obstacles’, omniscience becomes accomplished 
etat ca sugatasya iṣṭam ādau nairātmya kīrtanāt | sarva tīrthakṛtām tasmāt sthitaḥ mūrdhni tathāgataḥ || 	In fact, this (omniscience) that has been proved is that of Buddha himself, as it is he who, at the very outset, expounded the doctrine of ‘no-soul’. That is why he stands at the head of all philosophers 
tena pramāṇa saṃvādi tattva darśana yoginā | na tulya hetu yoga tā anyeṣām viruddha artha upadeśinām || pramāṇa gocarāḥ yeṣām pramā bādha ākulam vacaḥ | teṣām atyakṣa vijñāna śakti yogaḥ hi dūratas || 	There can be no equality between this teacher endowed with the true knowledge of truth, and other teachers who have expounded false doctrines. The knowledge of these latter is not vouched for by any means of right cognition, and their word is beset with annulment; therefore the capacity to know supersensuous things must be very far away from them 
sambaddha anuguṇa upāyam puruṣa artha abhidhāyakam | dṛṣṭe api arthe pramāṇābhyām īṣat api aprabādhitam || 	The words of Buddha are] well-knit,—they propound a compatible method,—and set forth what is useful for men; even in regard to perceptible things, they are not, in the least degree, annulled by the two means (and forms) of cognition 
tāpāt chedāt nikaṣāt vā kaladhautam iva amalam | parīkṣyamāṇam yat nā eva vikriyām pratipadyate || 	The words of Buddha] are free from impurities, like gold tested by ‘heating’, ‘cutting’ and ‘touching’; and, like the gold, they do not undergo any change in the process of testing and investigation 
samasta kumata dhvānta vidhvaṃsa anuguṇa udayam  | tathāgata vacaḥ ratnam alabdham bahu kalmaṣaiḥ || tatas sugatam eva āhuḥ sarvajñam ati śālinaḥ  | pradhāna puruṣa artha jñam tam ca eva āhuḥ bhiṣaj varam  || sugataḥ tena sarvajñaḥ kapilaḥ na iti tu pramā | anantara uditā vyaktā api eṣā mūḍhaiḥ na lakṣitā 	The jewel-like word of Buddha, whose appearance is conducive to the destruction of the entire mass of the darkness of wrong notions, is never got at by men beset with sins. That is why wise men declared Buddha alone to be omniscient,—cognisant of all such things as primordial matter and spirits; he has been called the ‘great physician—thus there is the definitely certain cognition that Buddha is omniscient, not Kapila. Though this cognition has been clearly spoken of, it has not been understood by dull-witted men 
yathā udita antarāt eva viśeṣaḥ api avadhāryate | ṛṣabha ādi ku tīrthebhyaḥ smara bhaṅga vidhāyinaḥ || 	From what has been said, it is also learnt wherein lies the distinction of the ‘suppressor of desires’ (Buddha) from ṛṣabha and other incompetent teachers 
kaḥ hi niḥśeṣa śāstra artha tattva jñam manyate jaḍaḥ  | samāna bhojana jñānāt mātṛkā mātra vedanāt || tat yena hetunā ekasya sarvajña tvam prasādhyate | tad hetu vastunaḥ asattvāt na saḥ anyasya upatiṣṭhate || 	What fool is there who will regard a person who knows the letters of the alphabet only, as conversant with the essence of all the sciences,—merely on the ground of his possessing equal knowledge of food? Thus then, that reason by which the omniscience of one person is established is not available in the case of another person;—because the essence of that reason is absent in this latter case 
tad dūṣaṇāni asaṃrambhāḥ sarvajña jina śāsane | śākyāḥ yāni vadanti eva tāni aśaktāḥ digambarāḥ || 	Thus, those objections that the Buddhists, without anger, urge against the assertion of the omniscience of Jina,—the Jainas are not in a position to urge (against the Buddhist) 
yat siddha pratibandhena pramāṇena upapāditam | tattvam saugata siddhānte siddham na anya mate tathā || tena vyavasthitaiḥ teṣām bhinnaiḥ sādhana dūṣaṇaiḥ | pratibimba udaya agrastaiḥ nirṇayaḥ kriyatā amalam || 	Because the truth that has been found in the buddhist doctrine, through proofs with well-established premises,—has not been so found in any other doctrine,—therefore please draw as many definite conclusions as you can, through various reasonings and counter-reasonings, which are well-founded and not swallowed by their own reflections 
sarva ākārajña tāyāḥ tu na kaścid api vidyate | sākṣāt itarathā vā api virodhaḥ jñeya tā ādibhiḥ || ajñeya tva ādi viśleṣāt jñeya tva ādi vyavasthitam | na sarvajña tva viśleṣāt tat punar sthita lakṣaṇam || 	As a matter of fact, there is no incompatibility, direct or indirect, between the character of ‘knowing all things’ and that of ‘being cognisable, etc.’—in fact ‘cognisability’ is proved by the ‘absence of incognisability’, not by the ‘absence of omniscience’; this latter therefore retains its character 
sarvajña tvam na ca api etat kvacid saṃpūrṇa kāraṇam | sattva ādi sambhave paścāt prāk pravṛttam nivarttate || 	Omniscience has never before been seen to appear on the appearance of its complete cause,—by virtue of which it could be said to cease on the appearance of the character of ‘being an entity’ and so forth 
na aviruddha vidhāne ca yuktam anya nivartanam | anya tā rūpa sadbhāvāt rasa abhāvaḥ api gamyate || 	The affirmation of what is not incompatible cannot be rightly regarded as setting aside the other. otherwise the presence of colour might mean the absence of taste

asarvajña praṇīta tvam na ca evam tasya yujyate | sarvajña tā samākṣepāt atas saṃvādanam bhavet || anubhūya yathā kaścid auṣṇayam paścāt prabhāṣate | tasmāt vastu avisaṃvādaḥ tad artha anubhava udbhavāt || tena sarvajña tā kāle hetoḥ asya aprasiddha tā | vyāhāra vṛtti kāle tu bhavet siddha prasādhanam || 	Even so, it cannot be right to regard his words as those uttered by one who is not-omniscient; because his non-omniscience has been discarded by his omniscience; hence there should be agreement. for instance, having experienced heat, one speaks of it [and this speech is reconciled, in agreement, with the previous experience or cognition]; from this there is no disagreement with the real state of things, because the speech is the outcome of the direct cognition of those things. thus then, at the time when the lord is omniscient, the reason adduced by the other party is not present; and as regards the time of ordinary usage, his argument would be superfluous 
samasta vastu vijñāna śakti apākaraṇe api te | saṃdigdha vyatireki tvam tad avastham prasajyate || vyāhāra vṛtti sāmarthye hetu tvena api saṃmate | saṃdigdha vyatireki tva doṣaḥ eva anuvarttate || 	Even if you deny the capacity to know all things, your reason still remains open to the charge of its presence in the contrary of the probandum being doubtful.—Even if you wish your reason to consist in the capacity to use, the same defect, of the possibility of its presence in the contrary of the probandum, persists 
cakra bhramaṇa yogena nirvikalpe api tāyini  | sambhāra āvega sāmarthyāt deśanā saṃpravarttate || iti ye sudhiyaḥ prāhuḥ tān prati api na sidhyati  | vaktṛ tvam yat tu lokena mata mādhyavasāyikam || tatra tādṛśi hetoḥ syāt sandigdha vyatireki tā | nanu ca asiddha tā kena mate atra anupapattike || 	Even when Tāyin (Buddha) is free from conceptual content, his teachings go on under the force of the initial momentum,—in the manner of the revolutions of the wheel’;—even against the wise men who hold this view, the argument of the other party is of no avail 
ucyate yadi vaktṛ tvam svatantram sādhanam matam  | tadānīm āśraya asiddhaḥ sandigdha asiddha tā athavā  || asya ca arthasya sandehāt sandigdha asiddha tā sthirā  | prasaṅga sādhanam tasmāt tvayā vaktavyam īdṛśam || tatra ca āgama mātreṇa siddhaḥ dharmaḥ prakāśyate | na tu tad bhāva siddhi artham jñāpakam vidyate param || 	Our answer is as follows:—if ‘speakership’ by itself, is meant to be the reason, then it is one whose substratum is unknown,—or its ‘inadmissibility’ is suspected. In fact, the exact connotation of the word being doubtful, the fact remains that it is one whose ‘inadmissibility’ is suspected. Consequently, if you have to urge such an argument, you can do so only as a reductio ad absurdum.—And in such an argument what has to be urged must be what is knowable only from the scriptures (of the other party); and there can be no other means of proving its existence 
evam yasya praseya tva vastu sattā ādi lakṣaṇāḥ | nihantum hetavaḥ aśaktāḥ kaḥ na tam kalpayiṣyati || veda vādi mukha sthā evam yuktiḥ laukika vaidikī | na kācid api śākya ugrasarpa jñāna viṣa apahā  || dṛś viṣaiḥ iha dṛṣṭaḥ api svalpa śaktiḥ dvijaḥ jaḍaḥ | veda vādi mukha sthā tu yuktiḥ sādhuḥ api durbhagā 	When reasons such as ‘being known’, ‘being an entity’, ‘being’ and so forth are incapable of setting aside the omniscient person,—who is there who will not admit his existence?—Thus no reason, either temporal or scriptural, that the upholder of the Veda can have in his mouth, is capable of removing the poison of the awful serpent in the shape of the knowledge of the Śākya.—In fact, the feeble and dull-witted Brāhmaṇa, even when merely glanced at by the poison from the eyes (of that serpent), becomes unable even to breathe,—what to say of setting it aside! Any reasoning, even when sound, becomes ugly in the mouth of the Vedic scholar,—on account of its abundance in a lowly substratum; just like the string of beads placed at the feet 
pāvaka avyabhicāri tvam dhūmasya api na śakyate | vaktum tena yatas dhūmaḥ tad mate anyatra vartate || eka vastu svarūpa tvāt udanvati api vartate | tatra api anala sadbhāve vyatirekaḥ kimāśrayaḥ || 	He cannot assert even the infallibility of the concomitance between smoke and fire; because, under his view, smoke exists elsewhere also; in fact, being of the one uniform nature of ‘entity’, it exists in the ocean also; and if fire exists there also, then where would the absence (of the probans) lie? 
tad rūpa kārya vijñaptiḥ kiṃvā tatra api naḥ bhavet | vilakṣaṇa ātma bhāve vā vastu bhedaḥ astu tāttvikaḥ || 	Why should not then there be recognition of the form and of the effects of fire in water also?—The only other alternative is that the nature of the two things being distinct, the difference among things must be real 
samasta vastu sambaddha tattva abhyāsa bala udgatam  | sārvajñam mānasam jñānam mānam ekam prakalpyate  || na tu netra ādi vijñānam tatas kim idam ucyate | nūnam sa cakṣuṣā sarvān rasa asarvātrasa ādīn pratipadyate  || siddham ca mānasam jñānam rūpa ādi anubhava ātmakam  | avivādaḥ parasya api vastuni etāvati sphuṭaḥ || varṇyate hi smṛtiḥ tena rūpa śabda ādi gocarā  | svapne ca mānasam jñānam sarva artha anubhava ātmakam || tatas ca aniyata arthena mānasena 	The only evidence that is suggested is that of the mental cognition of omniscience as brought about by the repeated practice of the ‘truth’ relating to all things;—and not the ordinary visual and other cognitions. Under the circumstances, how can it be asserted that the said person should cognise taste, etc. through the eye?—As regards mental cognition of things like colour and the rest, it has been accepted, without dispute, even by the other party; in fact, it is on the basis of this mental cognition that the remembrance of colour and other things has been said to be produced.—During dreams also, there is mental cognition in the shape of the apprehension of all things.—Thus then, the omniscient person being postulated on the basis of mental cognition, the scope of which is not restricted,—how could he cognise taste, etc, through the eye? This objection might apply, if he were held to know all things through the eye itself. As a matter of fact however, he does cognise taste and other things collectively, through the mind.—Even in cases where some superior peculiarity is found (in the cognitions of the omniscient person), in regard to the perception of subtle and remote things,—it is all within the scope of the said mind and mental concepts; and it is not due to the functioning of the auditory organ on colour; all these undesirable contingencies that other people have urged against us are not applicable to us at all; because all the superiority and peculiarity lies in the mental cognition itself, and it does not lie beyond the scope of this cognition. Thus then for us, the things that were cognised in the past by certain means of cognition are precisely the same that are cognised now by the same means of cognition 
viśuddham vā bhavet jñānam sarvam sarva artha gocaram | hetoḥ saṃbhāvyate kaścid phale api atiśayaḥ kvacid  || na hi sūkṣma phalāḥ dṛṣṭāḥ āmalakyaḥ marau iti | sarvāḥ tattvena tad rūpāḥ anyatra api bhavanti tāḥ  || śṛṇvanti cakṣuṣā sarpāḥ iti eṣā api śrutiḥ tatas  | sambhāvya arthāḥ vicitrāḥ hi sattvānām karma śaktayaḥ || 	Or, all cognition, when pure, would, as a rule, apprehend all things; though in a certain case, there may be some peculiarity in the resultant of the cognition, due to particular causes. For instance, the āmalakī is found to yield a smaller fruit; because the āmalakī growing in the desert has been found to yield a small fruit, it does not necessarily follow that it will always, in other places also, produce fruits of the same small size.—Similarly, there is the assertion that serpents hear through their eyes.—In fact, the capacities of, action belonging to all things are wonderful and anything might be possible for them 
yasya adhva tritaya stham hi sarvam vastu avabhāsate | tathā niyata sāmarthyam vaktum ittham sa śobhate || 	Such an assertion can sound well only when proceeding from one who has the apprehension of all things at all the three points of time, as restricted in their capacity

In fact, if you had the knowledge of the capacity of all things, omniscience would indeed be yours!—nor can it be known by means of inference, as there would always be a suspicion regarding its being otherwise

Similarly, people are distinctly and truly found to be possessed of the capacities of curious incantations, nāgas, demons and spirits of all kinds.—all this may not be seen, and yet there is no proof for denying it. Hence it cannot be said that he does not exist,

In this way, the intelligent man would be able to see subtle things, and while transcending the limitations of his own kind, he would be rising above other men 3402-3403) Just as the capacity of the ear and other sense-organs in relation to their objects, becomes improved by special exercise, medication and other means,—so would be the case with the mind also 
tathā hi vīkṣyate rūpam gṛdhraiḥ dūratara sthitam | tiraskṛtam nidhāna ādi tathā siddhāñjana ādikaiḥ || 	For example, vultures are able to see things lying at a very great distance: and people are enabled to perceive hidden treasures and other things by the use of unguents and collyrium with magical powers 
evam gati viśeṣeṇa deva ādeḥ darśanam bhavet | sūkṣma vyavahita ādīnām sva upapattyā ānurūpyataḥ || 	In the same manner, through special exercises, one would be enabled to see the celestial and other beings, as also things subtle, hidden and so forth,—in accordance with his own limitations

What we find in him is a superior grade of wisdom, mercy and such qualities brought about by constant practice,—and from our knowledge of these qualities we deduce our knowledge of his other kinds of superiority also. And as these are qualities of the mind, there is every possibility of their rising to the highest stage.—Like the cruelty (of wicked people), the knowledge of all things reaches the highest stage, through constant practice; thus is that wisdom attained which consists in the knowledge of things; and it remains incomplete while even a single thing remains unknown

And as in the case of the vrīhi and other grains, so in the case of mercy, wisdom and other qualities also, it is quite possible that when these latter, endowed with the said character, reach their higher stages, there results omniscience

If it is possible for these, endowed as they are with the said character, to have impurities,—then it is equally possible for their opposite to uproot that impurity 
tattva dṛṣṭi nibandha tvāt atyanta apacayaḥ kvacid  | bāhyasya iva asya tamasaḥ āntarasya api gamyate || tasya ca apacaye jāte jñānam avyāhatam mahat | svātantryeṇa pravarteta sarvatra jñeya maṇḍale || 	In some cases, there is absolute deterioration of things that obstruct the perception of truth, as is found in the case of the external as well as internal darkness. when there is deterioration of this, true knowledge appears untrammelled and proceeds to apply to the whole circle of knowable things 
ye vā sthira āśraye vṛttāḥ kathañcid api ca āhitāḥ  | tad bhāvāya a punar yatna vyāpekṣā bādhake asati || saṃskāra utkarṣa bhedena kāṣṭhā paryanta vṛttayaḥ | te sambhavanti vispaṣṭam śātakumbha viśuddhi vat || yathā abhihita dharmāṇaḥ ime mati daya ādayaḥ | teṣām paryanta vṛttau ca sarva vid tvam prabhāsvaram  || laṅghana udaka tāpābhyām na ca iha vyabhicāri tā | na hi tad laṅgha ghanāt eva laṅghanam bala yatnayoḥ 	Or, those that subsist in a lasting substratum, having come about in it somehow, and—so long as there is no force to the contrary, they do not need any further effort towards bringing them about again,—these, by the excellence of the treatment they receive, reach the highest stage of perfection;—as for example, the purification of gold;—knowledge, mercy and such qualities are all of the said kind; so that when these have reached the highest state of perfection, there is brilliant omniscience.—nor can this reason be held to be fallible (false) in view of the two cases of jumping and water-heating; because jumping follows not from the jumping itself, but from strength and effort 
yadi vā laṅghanasya api kāṣṭhā paryanta vṛtti tā  | samādhi bala gati ādi viśeṣāt syāt sva hetutaḥ  || siddhiḥ manojava asaṃjñā tathā ca śrūyate pramā | yathā cintita mātreṇa yāti dūram api prabhu || na ca api adṛṣṭi mātreṇa tad abhāvaḥ prasiddhyati  | na ca atra bādhakam kiṃcid vaktum atra paraḥ kṣamaḥ || 	Or, the jumping also is something that is capable of reaching the highest stage of perfection,—which would proceed from its own causes, through concentrated effort and strength: this capacity is named ‘manojava’ (mind-force). It is in connection with such capacity that we hear (and read) of such facts as that the lord reaches remote places by merely thinking of it.—The mere fact that such power is not seen cannot prove that it does not exist; nor can the opponent put forward any reason that could annul such an idea 
rājahaṃsa śiśuḥ śaktaḥ nirgantum na gṛhāt api | yāti ca abhyāsa bhedena pāram ambhaḥpateḥ api || āśraya upādhika abhyāsa bhedāt asya gatiḥ yathā  | tādṛśī tādṛśāt eva kim na sambhāvyate adhikā || bodhisattva daśāyām hi na śaktaḥ tādṛśīm gatim | prāptum prāpte samādhau tu viśiṣṭe śaknuyāt muniḥ || 	The young rāja-haṃsa (swan) is unable to move out of the house even; but through practice, it becomes able to go beyond the ocean also. Just as this movement of his is the result of the exercise of the particular conditions of the receptacle (i.e. the body),—similarly, why cannot similar, or even higher, powers be possible (in the blessed lord)? at the preceding stage of the ‘Bodhisattva’, however, he is notable to attain such power of movement; but the great sage would certainly attain it on his reaching the highest state of ‘communion’ If a man is able to jump to the height of 15 feet, he could certainly acquire the capacity to jump to greater heights, through similar means 
uṣṇa tām nīyamānasya kṣayaḥ bhavati ca ambhasaḥ | asthairyāt āśrayasya atas kasya kasmin prakṛṣṭa tā  || mānasānām guṇānām tu citta santatiḥ āśrayaḥ  | sā ādhāra yogataḥ vṛttāt na kathaṃcid nivarttate || 	While the water is being heated, it is gradually undergoing destruction (evaporation); thus the substratum being not ‘lasting’, what and where would the ‘perfection’ lie? Of mental qualities, the substratum consists in the ‘chain of consciousness’; and this never ceases to function through its connection with its receptacle 
yāvat yāvat guṇa oghaḥ asyām ābhimukhyena vartate  | prabhāsvaratarā tāvat sutarām eva vartate || prabhāsvaram idam cittam tattva darśana sātmakam  | prakṛtyā eva sthitam yasmāt malāḥ tu āgantavaḥ matāḥ || 	As the flow of qualities goes on appearing in the ‘chain of consciousness’, so it goes on becoming more and more luminous 
para bodha ātma niyatam cetaḥ yadi hi sambhavet | tadā asiddha upalambha tvāt artha vittiḥ na sambhavet || tasmāt sva saṃvedana ātma tvam cetasaḥ asti prakāśanāt | anāropita rūpā ca sva saṃvittiḥ iyam sthitā || 	If consciousness were restricted to the cognition of something apart from itself, then, as it itself would not be cognised, there could be no cognition of things. Consequently consciousness has to be regarded as essentially ‘self-cognised’, specially because it is illuminative. Hence this consciousness remains as something free from all imposition 
mārge sātmyam atas yāte tetataiḥ tasya abhibhavaḥ na hi | rāga dveṣa ādibhiḥ doṣaiḥ te hi prāk eva durbalāḥ || sātmībhāvāt ca mārgasya sarva apakṣāla nāśinaḥ | na yatnena vinā hāniḥ yatnaḥ na guṇa darśanāt || atas nirbhala niṣkampa guṇa sandoha bhūṣaṇaḥ | doṣa vāta a vikampya ātmā sarvajñaḥ gamyate jinaḥ 	When, thus, the ‘path’ has become identified with him, there can be no suppression of it by love, hatred and other defects, since they had been already feeble before. The ‘path’—which is destructive of all defects,—having become thus identified,—there can be no loss of it without effort; and there can be no such effort, as its good points have been perceived.—Thus it is that Jina is understood to be the omniscient person adorned by a pure and firm host of good qualities, whose soul cannot be shaken by the storm of defects 
kiñca ye ye ti vibhāvyante te te bhrābhānti parisphuṭam | bhāvanā pariniṣpattau kāma ādi viṣayāḥ iva || sarva dharmāḥ ca bhāvyante dīrgha kālam anekadhā  | śūnya anātma ādi rūpeṇa tāttvikena mahātmabhiḥ mahān matiḥ || śūnya anātma ādi rūpasya bhāvika tvam ca sādhitam  | bhūta artha bhāvanā udbhūteḥ pramāṇam tena tat matam || 	Whatever things are conceived become clearly manifest, at the completion of the conception; as is found in the case of the objects of desire;—all things are conceived by great sages, for a long time and several times, in their real form, as ‘void’, ‘no-soul’ and so forth. That the ‘void’, ‘no-soul’ and the rest are the real forms has been proved before. Hence as arising out of the conception of really existent things, the said conception has been rightly regarded as right and valid 
pratyakṣam vyakta bhāsi tvāt pramāṇam vastu saṅgateḥ | cakṣuḥ ādi āśraya udbhūta nīla ādi pratibhāsa vat || sambhavati eka vijñāne sakṛt spaṣṭa avabhāsanam | sarveṣām api dharmāṇām atas ca evam pratīyatām || tathā vibhāvyamāna tvāt aṅganā ātmaja cora vat | icchā mātra mukhībhāvā bhāvanā api na durlabhā 	The cognition in question is vouched foe by ‘perception’, because it is clearly manifest, and is in keeping with the real nature of things; just like the appearance of blue and other things, arising from the contact of the eye and other sense-organs. The single clear appearance of all things in a single cognition is quite possible,—which please understand; also because things are so conceived of, like the woman, the son and the thief; conception too is not difficult to get at, as it can present itself before one by merely wishing for it 
bhāvanā utkarṣa niṣṭha eka buddhi spaṣṭa prakāśanāḥ | vastu sattva ādi hetubhyaḥ sarva dharmāḥ priya ādi vat || evam ca yasya vastu tva sattva utpāda ādi lakṣaṇāḥ | niścaye hetavaḥ śaktāḥ kaḥ na tam sādhayiṣyati || eka jñāna kṣaṇa vyāpta niḥśeṣa jñeya maṇḍalaḥ | sura asura śiraḥ ratna bhūtaḥ siddhaḥ atra sarva vid 	All things must be regarded as clearly manifested by the one cognition that represents the highest stage of the conception,—because of such reasons as ‘being entities’, ‘being existent’ and the like,—like the beloved woman and others.—Similarly, when the certainty regarding a thing is capable of being proved by such reasons as ‘being an entity’, ‘being existent’, ‘being produced’ and the like,——who is there who will not regard it as well-established? 
jñātāḥ dharma ādayaḥ vai te kenacid vacanāt ṛte | satya ātmanā upadiṣṭa tvāt kanaka ādi viśuddhi vat || 	Dharma and other things must have been known to some person, without any verbal expressions,—because they have been taught by truthful men,—like the purity of gold and such things 
vedānām pauruṣeya tve siddhe siddham na sādhanam | ajñātasya upadeśaḥ asti tathyaḥ yādṛcchikaḥ naraḥ hi || 	It having been proved that the Veda is the work of a human being, our argument is not proving what is already proved (and hence futile). Mere random teaching of what is not known cannot be always true 
ātma udāharaṇena anya sāmarthya abhāva niścaye | puruṣa tva ādi hetubhyaḥ kārye ca atiprasajyate || evam hi bhavataḥ jāḍye niścite sarva sūrayaḥ | tvad udāharaṇena eva bhaveyuḥ jaḍa buddhayaḥ || 	As a matter of fact, there is no limit to the knowledge of man. Hence the statement in question is a mere assertion made without any reason

Because where nothing against a certain idea is perceived, nor anything in support of it,—there arises a doubt regarding it; which indicates its probability. In fact, it is only when this probability is there, that there can be such an assertion to the contrary (made by the mīmāṃsaka) as that—“it is by means of the Veda alone that dharma can be known” 
anāgate ca vijñeye pratyakṣasya tathā bhavet | sāmarthyam yoginām uktam tatra aikālya parīkṣaṇe || 	Even in regard to future things, the capacity of perception would be applicable, in the case of mystics,—as has been pointed out in the chapter on ‘the three points of time’ 
yadi vā yoga sāmarthyāt bhūta ajāta nibham sphuṭam | liṅga āgama nirāśaṃsam mānasam yoginām bhavet || 	Or, through the powers of Yoga, the mental perception of mystics would clearly envisage the past and the future also, independently of inference and the word

atīndriya artha vijñānam pūrva uktāt anumānataḥ | muneḥ sumatayaḥ prāhuḥ na anyatas tu āgamāt kṛtāt || 	The wise men have declared that the knowledge of the sage of supersensuous things proceeds from the inference stated before,—not from any revealed word

vakta kṛtrima vākyānām ucyate nanu anādi tā 	In fact, the beginninglessness of the expounders and of the eternal sentences that is asserted by you for the purpose of proving their reliability, is denied by us as a sheer counterblast 
vaktāraḥ kartṛbhiḥ tulyāḥ tad apekṣā ca māna tā  | vedānām tad kṛta ākhyānāt artha pratyaya janmataḥ || 	The expounders stand on the same footing as the composers; and dependent upon them is the reliability of the Vedas; because the knowledge of the meaning of the Vedas is derived from the explanations provided by the said expounders 
atas na veda vākyānām pāratantryāt pramāṇa tā  | apaśyatām svayam dharmam vaktṝṇām api nā eva sā || tat īdṛśām pravaktṝṇām kalpyamānā api anādi tā  | aprāmāṇya pada stha tvāt nāstika ādeḥ na bhidyate || tad ajñāta tad ajñāna viśeṣa tvāt sarvam yāti atra tulya tām  | na māna tva apramāṇa tve syātām evam anādinī || 	In this way, the Vedic sentences, being dependent upon other things, cannot be reliable.—As regards the expounders, as they do not themselves perceive dharma, these also can never be reliable. Of such expounders, even though beginninglessness may be postulated, it would be in a position that is not reliable; and hence it would not be different in character from the beginninglessness of the unbelievers and others. Thus there being no difference discernible, all this comes to be on the same footing; so that neither reliability nor unreliability would be beginningless 
yat vā asti eva viśeṣaḥ ayam munau tad vacaneṣu ca | sa dṛṣṭavān asvayam dharmam uktavān ca kṛpā mayaḥ || 	In fact, there is this difference between the sage and those words,—that he perceived the dharma himself and expounded them through mercy 
yatas abhyudaya niṣpattiḥ yatas niḥśreyasasya ca | sa dharmaḥ ucyate tādṛś sarvaiḥ eva vicakṣaṇaiḥ || 	That is described as ‘dharma’ by all wise persons from which follows ‘prosperity’ and the ‘highest good’ 
tad ukta mantra yoga ādi niyamāt vidhivat kṛtāt | prajñā ārogya vibhu tva ādi dṛṣṭa dharmaḥ api jāyate || 	As a matter of fact, wherever the rules laid down by him relating to incantations and communion and such things, are properly followed in practice, one becomes endowed with even such perceptible qualities as wisdom, health, power and so forth 
samasta dharma nairātmya darśanāt tad prakāśitāt  | sat kārya darśana udbhūta kleśa oghasya nivarttanam  || ātma ātmīya dṛś ākāra sattva dṛṣṭiḥ pravarttate | aham mama iti māne ca kleśaḥ aśeṣaḥ pravarttate || sattva dṛś pratyanīkam ca tat nairātmya nidarśanam  | abhyāsāt sātmyam āyāte tasmin sā vinivarttate  || tad mūla kleśa rāśiḥ ca hetu abhāvāt pratīhīyate  | tasmin asati tad hetuḥ na punar jāyate bhavaḥ || tad atyanta vinirmukteḥ apavarga 	From the realisation of the doctrine of the ‘soul-less-ness of all things’ as taught by him, follows the cessation of the whole mass of afflictions due to the notion of things having such existence. This notion of the reality of things appears in the form of ‘self’ and ‘things related to the self’, it is only when there are notions of ‘i’ and ‘mine’ that the whole mass of afflictions becomes operative.—The said perception of ‘soul-less-ness’ is the enemy of this notion of reality; hence when the former becomes duly absorbed and realised, the latter disappears; therefore the entire mass of afflictions due to that notion of reality ceases, on account of the absence of its cause; and when that ceases, there is no more birth due to that. Thus there being absolute liberation from birth, this state is spoken of as the ‘final goal’.—Thus the perception of ‘soul-less-ness’ is the door to unrivalled ‘good’.—All other philosophers have held that liberation follows from the cessation of the ‘i-notion’; but if there is a ‘soul’, this ‘i-notion’ can never cease; because its efficient cause would always be there; so the objective of that notion too would not be abrogated. If it were abrogated, there would be negation of it, which would mean a complete volte-face on their part 
na yuktam na aham iti evam yadi aham nāma vidyate | niyamāt tattva vidyā ati nirvāṇam iti vā mṛṣā || 	The notion ‘i am not’ cannot be right if the ‘i’ really exists. or else, it is not true ‘that one who knows the truth must attain nirvāṇa 
tasmāt anyeṣu tīrtheṣu daśa akuśala hānitaḥ  | leśataḥ abhyudaya prāptiḥ yadi api asti laghīyasī  || apavargasya tu prāptiḥ na manāk api vidyate | sattva dṛṣṭi viśiṣṭa tvāt kleśa mūla anapoddhṛteḥ || 	Thus then, under other systems, there is just a little ‘welfare’ (prosperity) secured through the destruction of the ‘ten sins’;—the attainment of the highest good there is none in the least: and the reason for this lies in the fact that all these are associated with the notion of the ‘real existence’ (of the soul) and hence the root of the ‘afflictions’ is not removed 
daśa karma yathā pathāḥ proktāḥ śubhāḥ ye tāyinā punar | sabhyak dṛṣṭi upagūḍhāḥ te balavantaḥ bhavanti alam || 	On the other hand, the ‘ten noble paths’ that have been taught by Tāyin (Buddha) are embedded in true knowledge and hence they are sufficiently powerful 
sattva dṛṣṭi upagūḍhāḥ tu viparyāsa anuṣaṅgataḥ | aviśuddhāḥ tatas śuddham phalam tebhyaḥ na jāyate || tat evam dharma tattvasya deśake muni sattame | a paśyataḥ svayam dharmam iti kaḥ svastha dhīḥ vadet || 	Those others are clothed in the notion of the real existence (of the soul) and involve a ‘Volte face’:—as such they are not pure; consequently pure results do not flow from them.—Thus then, if one does not himself perceive in the great sage the teacher of the essence of dharma, and consequently remains ignorant of dharma,—how can he attain peace of mind? 
tāyinaḥ sarva vijña tvam yā ca vedasya nitya tā  | tulye jalpanti naḥ vijñāḥ nitya tāyāḥ asambhavāt || tasyāḥ hi bādhakam proktam krama akrama virodhataḥ | vijñāna ādi na tat kāryam kathañcid api yujyate || 	The ‘omniscience of Buddha’ and the ‘eternality of the Veda’ have not been declared by any wise man to stand on the same footing; and this because the said eternality is impossible. The argument against it has been already pointed out, as consisting in the incompatibility involved in ‘simultaneity’ and ‘successiveness’;—by reason of this it cannot bring about any such effects as cognition and the like 
dṛśyate na ca sarvajñaḥ idānīm iti kim yat  tvayā  | atha sarvaiḥ iti proktam vistareṇa iha dūṣaṇam || bhāvatkaḥ anupalambhaḥ hi kevalaḥ vyabhicāravān | sarva anya dṛś nivṛttiḥ tu saṃdigdhā iti na sādhanam || nirākaraṇa vat śakyā na ca āsīt iti kalpanā  | iti ayuktam atīte api tat nirākṛtya yogataḥ 	As regards the argument that the omniscient person is not seen at the present time—by you or by all men,—this has been already answered in detail. As regards non-perception by you, that, by itself, is ‘fallible’, ‘inconclusive’, as regards non-perception by all other men, that must remain always doubtful 
syāt matam yaḥ vyatītaḥ adhvā sa śūnyaḥ tava sarva darśinā  | kāla tvāt tat yathākālaḥ vartamānaḥ pratīyate || saṃdigdha vyatireki tvāt yuktam etat na sādhanam | vartamānaḥ ca kālaḥ ayam tena śūnyaḥ na niścitaḥ || 	The following might be urged—“The period that is past was devoid of the omniscient person,—because it was a period of time,—like the present time which is actually perceived”.—This argument however, is not right, as its contrary is open to doubt; inasmuch as there can be no certainty regarding the present time being devoid of the omniscient person 
hetu sāmagrī abhāvāt ca bhūtaḥ nāma na samprati | rāma ādi vat atīte tu kāle kena na sambhavet || 	It is quite possible that what existed in the past is not there in the present because the whole set of its causes is not present. Why should it not be that such a person existed in the past,—like Rāma and others? 
prajñā ādīnām ca dharmi tvam kṛtvā liṅgam udīritam | nanātat nāma dṛśyate liṅgam na ca sattā prasisādhyate || 	Wisdom’ and the rest hate been made the ‘subject’, and then the inferential indicative has been set forth; hence it is not true that ‘no indicative is recognised’,—and yet we are not seeking to prove the existence (of the person) 
āgamena tu sarvajñaḥ na asmābhiḥ pratipādyate | laiṅge sati hi pūrva ukte kaḥ nāma āgamataḥ vadet || 	We are not affirming the existence of the omniscient person on the basis of scriptural declarations. When the inferential reason is available, who would make an assertion on the basis of verbal authority? 
kintu veda pramāṇa tvam yadi yuṣmābhiḥ iṣyate | tat kim bhagavataḥ mūḍhaiḥ sarvajña tvam na gamyate || nimitta nāmni sarvajñaḥ bhagavān muni sattamaḥ | śākhā antare hi vispaṣṭam paṭhyate brāhmaṇaiḥ budhaiḥ || 	But if you regard the Veda as reliable, then, how is it that you, deluded people, do not apprehend the omniscience of the blessed lord? as a matter of fact, in the Vedic rescensional text called ‘nimitta’, the learned Brāhmaṇas clearly read of the revered great sage as ‘omniscient’ 
yaḥ asau ṣaṣ dantam ātmānam avadāta dvipa ātmakam | svapne pradarśya saṃjātaḥ bodhisattvaḥ guṇa udadhiḥ || vighuṣṭa śabdaḥ sarvajñaḥ kṛpā ātmā sa bhaviṣyati  | prāpta amṛta padaḥ śuddhaḥ sarva loka pitā api ca  || 	He is described as] one who, having shown himself in a dream as a six-tusked white elephant, was born as one going to be a Bodhisattva, the ocean of fine qualities, his fame proclaimed, omniscient, full of mercy, attaining the state of immortality, pure, the father of the whole world 
atha śākhā antaram na idam veda antargatam iṣyate | tat atra na nimittam vaḥ dveṣam muktvā avadhāryate || svara ādayaḥ ca te dharmāḥ prasiddhāḥ śruti bhāvinaḥ | kartum atrā api śakyāḥ te nara icchā mātra sambhavāt || 	If this rescensional text just mentioned is not accepted as such,—then, for that, we can discover no reason except sheer hostility on your part. Because accentuation and other properties that belong to the Vedic text are all possible in regard to this text also: specially as these properties are dependent upon the mere whim of men 
nanu na evam patat paraḥ nityaḥ śakyaḥ labdhum iha āgamaḥ  | nityaḥ ced arthavāda tvam tad pare syāt anitya tā  || 	As a matter of fact, no scriptural text to this effect can be found; but if such an assertion were eternal, then it could be only commendatory; and if it really spoke of a person, then it would be not-eternal.” 
tadā ca veda vākyānām svātantryeṇa artha niścayaḥ | vedāt svataḥ parasmāt ca moha ādi vivaśa ātmanaḥ || tena agnihotram juhuyāt svarga kāmaḥ iti śruteḥ | jinaḥ sarvajñaḥ iti evam na arthaḥ iti atra kā pramā || 	As regards the words of the Veda, as they are self-sufficient, their meaning could not be ascertained from the Veda itself;—nor from the learner by himself,—or from some other person,—who might be under the influence of delusion and other disabilities. Under the circumstances, how could there be any certainty regarding the assertion that—‘what is meant by the Vedic words—agnihotram juhuyāt svargakāmaḥ—is not that Jina is omniscient? 
svarga apavarga mātrasya vispaṣṭam upadeśataḥ | pradhāna artha parijñānāt sarvajñaḥ iti gamyate || samudrasikatā saṅkhyā vijñānam kva upayujyate | tasya asmākam atas anya artha jñāna saṃvedanena kim || 	That one is ‘omniscient’ is understood only from the clear teaching that he imparts regarding heaven and the highest good: Because that bears testimony to his knowledge of the most important matters. Of what use is the knowledge of the number of sands of the seas? What then have we got to do with his knowledge of other things? 
gauṇa tvena eva vaktavyaḥ saḥ api mantra artha vādava tvāt avid | iti ayam niyamaḥ sidhyet sarvajñe tu nirākṛte || pūrva ukta bādhaka ayoge sādhite tu sa vistaram | saṃdigdhaḥ gauṇa niyamaḥ mukhya arthasya api sambhavāt || 	That the descriptions should be understood in the figurative sense, like the mantra and Arthavāda texts,—would be right only after the actual existence of the omniscient person had been rejected.—As a matter of fact however, there is nothing to annul the idea of such a person; while, on the contrary, his existence has been actually proved in great detail. So that the idea of all this being figurative must remain doubtful: inasmuch as it is possible for it to be true in its primary sense 
dharma ādi gocara jñāna mātra apratigha tā yadi | saphalā varṇyate vyaktam tadā buddhaiḥ jitam jagat || yasmāt abhyudaye mokṣe saha etaiḥ sādhitam puras | jñānam apratigham teṣām āvaiṇikam ati sphuṭam || 	3532) Because it has been proved before that it is the lord’s knowledge relating to prosperity and highest good, along with these matters (dharma and the rest), which is ‘untrammelled’:—this is quite clear even to the veriest piper 
yat ca ātmani eva vijñānam dhyāna abhyāsa pravartitam | tasya api apratighāti tvam teṣām pūrvam prasādhitam || 	As regards the knowledge of self, brought about by the practice of meditation,—this also has been already proved to be ‘untrammelled’ in the case of those persons 
etat eva hi tat jñānam yat viśuddha ātma darśanam  | āgantuka mala apeta mala upeta citta mātra tva vedanāt || avedya vedaka ākārā buddhiḥ pūrvam prasādhitā  | dvaya upaplava śūnyā ca sā saṃbuddhaiḥ prakāśitā  || saṃsāra anucita jñānāḥ tena siddhāḥ mahā dhiyaḥ | yad ādhipatya bhāvinyaḥ bhāsante adyā api deśanāḥ 	That alone is knowledge of self which consists in the perception of the pure self,—as therein the only cognition is that of pure consciousness freed from all adventitious impurities 3535) It has been shown before that all cognition is in the form devoid of the apprehender and apprehended; it is free from the two aberrations. This is the cognition or knowledge that has been expounded by the Buddhas. That is what proves these to have been possessed of vast wisdom and of knowledge not conducive to birth and rebirth and it is the teachings inculcated under the guidance of these persons that are luminous to the present day 
prakṛtyā bhāsvare citte dvaya ākāra akalaṅkite | dvaya ākāra avimūḍha ātmā kaḥ kuryāt anyathāmatiḥtim || dvaya nairātmya bodhe ca strī ādi saṅkalpa bhāvinaḥ | rāga dveṣa ādayaḥ doṣāḥ saṃkṣīyante aprayatnataḥ || idam tat paramam tattvam tattva vādī jagāda yat | sarva sampad pradam ca eva keśava ādeḥ agocaraḥ || 	In regard to the luminous consciousness, not marred by the two forms,—who could entertain any wrong notions, if his mind is not deluded by the two forms?—As soon as there is recognition of the ‘soul-less-ness’ of both,—all those defects of love, hate and the like which have their source in the thoughts of women and such things, disappear without effort.—This is the highest truth which the ‘expounder of unity’ propounded,—which brings all kinds of prosperity, far beyond the reach’ of Keśava and others 
jñāyate hi sthira ātmā anyaiḥ śuddha sphaṭika saṃnibhaḥ | sa ca teṣām viparyāsaḥ nitya ātma pratiṣedhanāt || ātma grāhi ca vijñānam ātmanaḥ yadi jāyate | tatas sarva ātma vijñānam yugapad samprasajyate  || atha tasmāt na jāyeta nityam vā abhyupagamyate | tadā tad viṣayam na syāt puruṣa antara citta vat || 	Other people recognise the ‘soul’ as something permanent, resembling the pure rock-crystal; this idea of these people is clearly wrong, as the existence of the permanent ‘soul’ has been rejected. If the cognition envisaging the soul proceeds from one’s own soul, then there should be the cognition of all souls at one and the same time.—If it does not proceed from one’s own soul,—or if it is regarded as eternal,—then it could not envisage the soul at all:—being, in this respect like the cognitions of other persons 
grāhya lakṣaṇa vaidhuryāt vistareṇa ca sādhitāt | na etat eva hi tat jñānam yat viyadi śuddha ātma darśanam || atha api jñāna rūpa tvam ātmanaḥ abhyupagamyate | dṛśya darśana nānā tva bhāvāt na evam api grahaḥ || svayam prakāśa rūpa tvam tat jñānasya iṣyate yadi | sva saṃvittiḥ tadā prāptā pratyakṣā ca matiḥ bhavet || 	His knowledge does not consist in the direct perception of his pure self; because that is devoid of the characteristics of the ‘cognisable’, as has been proved in detail.—If the soul (self) is held to be of the nature of cognition (consciousness),—there can be no apprehension of it as such; because of the difference between the ‘seen’ and the ‘seeing’,—if then the said cognition is held to be self-illumined, then it comes to be ‘self-cognition’, and as such it would mean that the cognition is amenable to direct perception 
brahma ādīnām ca vedena sambandhaḥ na asti kaścana | bhedāt nitya tayā apekṣā viyogāt ca tad anya vat || tatas ca veda deha tvam brahma ādīnām asaṅgatam | sarva jñāna maya tvam ca vedasya artha aviniścayāt || svātantryeṇa ca sambuddhaḥ sarvajñaḥ upapāditaḥ | na punar veda deha tvāt brahma ādiḥ iva kalpyate || 	There can be no connection between Brahmā (and others) and the Veda;a) because there is difference between them, (b) because both are regarded as eternal, and (c) because there is no mutual dependence;—just as in the case of any other thing.—Thus it is absurd to talk of Brahmā, etc. being ‘embodiments of the veda’.—Equally absurd it is to speak of the Veda as ‘consisting of all knowledge’; for the simple reason that the meaning of the Veda cannot be ascertained.—It has been explained that (for us) the omniscient person is recognised independently by himself; and he is not assumed on the ground of Brahmā and others being ‘embodiments of the Veda’ 
pañca gati ātma saṃsāra bahis bhāvāt na martya tā  | buddhānām iṣyate asmābhiḥ nirmāṇam tat tathā matam || 	Being beyond the ‘metempsychic cycle’ consisting of the ‘five states’, the Buddhas are not held by us to be ‘mortal’, what has been regarded as their ‘birth’ is only the creation of themselves by themselves 
akaniṣṭhe pure ramye śuddha āvāsa vivarjite | buddhyante tatra saṃbuddhāḥ nirmitaḥ tu iha budhyate || 	It is in the delightful city of Akaniṣṭha, free from the habitation of unclean beings,—that the Buddhas become awakened; and what is awakened here (in this world) is only their own creation’ 
svātantryeṇa tu marttya tvam tvayā niścīyate katham | parakīya āgama dvārāt na tasya evam avasthiteḥ || na ca tad spardhayā asmābhiḥ te sarvajñāḥ iti iṣyate | ākāśa kusumaiḥ kaḥ hi sparddhām satyeṣu kalpayet || 	How too do you ascertain, independently, the said ‘mortality’? Certainly not on the basis of the ‘scripture’ of other people; as what that scripture says has just been pointed out.—Nor do we postulate our ‘omniscient persons’ as rivals to the ‘omniscient persons’ postulated by others; who could ever conceive of any rivalry between real entities and ‘sky-flowers’? 
sarva śakti viyogena nīrūpa tvam hi sādhitam | nityānām tena no santi pareṣṭāḥ trayambaka ādayaḥ || 	It has been proved by us that any eternal beings, being devoid of all capacity, must be formless. Hence it follows that the ‘three-eyed deity’ and other such beings, who are held by others to be omniscient, do not exist at all 
kiñca teṣām viparyastam jñānam ātma ādi darśanāt | buddhānām tu aviparyastam vistareṇa upapāditam || tat sparddhā kriyate taiḥ tu na dūra antara bhāvataḥ | kaḥ hi taimirikaiḥ sparddhām kuryāt svastha īkṣaṇe nare || 	Then again, the knowledge of those persons is all wrong, because it involves notions of the ‘soul’ and such other things. The knowledge of the Buddhas, on the other hand, is not wrong; as has been explained in detail. There is therefore no comparison made between these two sets, on the ground of greater or less proximity; who could institute any comparison between the blind and the man with perfect eyes? 
guṇa karmeśvara ādīnām vedānām ca apahasti tā  | nitya tā atas ca na asmābhiḥ nityaḥ āgamaḥ iṣyate || 	In fact, the eternality of all such things as quality, action, god, as also of the Vedas, has been totally rejected. Consequently we do not admit of any eternal ‘scripture’ 
upamānena sarvajña sattā siddhiḥ na ca iṣyate | tasya apramāṇa tā prokteḥ sattā siddhiḥ tatas na ca  || prasiddhāyām hi sattāyām sādṛśyam gamyate tatas  | sādhanam prakṛtam ca idam sattāyāḥ sarva vedinaḥ || tat na upamānataḥ siddhiḥ pratiṣedhaḥ aphalaḥ kṛtatas  | narāḥ dṛṣṭāḥ tu asarvajñāḥ sarve ced bhavatā tatas  || tava eva sarva vittā syāt dūra vyavahita īkṣaṇāt | anya santāna sambaddha jñāna śakteḥ ca dṛṣṭitaḥ 	We do not hold that the existence of the omniscient person is proved by analogy; because it has been shown that analogy is not a reliable means of cognition. Hence the said existence could not be proved by it. It is only when the existence of a thing has been cognised, that its similarity can be perceived; and what is desired to be proved in the present context is the existence of the all-knowing person;—and this cannot be proved by means of analogy. Hence your denial of this (in reference to the said person) is entirely futile.—If all men have been perceived by you to be not-omniscient,—then omniscience belongs to you yourself, since you perceive all men, those near you as well as those remote;—and since you perceive the capacity of cognitions appearing in the ‘chain’ of all other men 
puraḥ sthite api puṃsi syāt katham tava viniścayaḥ | na ayam sarvajñaḥ iti evaṃbhāve atīndriya vid bhavān || ātma asarvajña tā dṛṣṭau śeṣa asarvajña niścaye  | bādhā dṛṣṭeḥ na ced sarva dharma niścayaḥ iṣyate  | bādhā śaṅkā nanu ukte api bādhā dṛṣṭeḥ na bhidyate || 	Even if the person were standing before you, how could you have the certainty that ‘he is not omniscient’? if you had this knowledge, you would be cognisant of things beyond the senses!—If you deduce the fact of all persons being not-omniscient from seeing that you yourself are not so,—then, there would be this incongruity that (your) Brahmā and other deities would deduce the omniscience of all persons from their own omniscience.—If it be urged that—“there is conviction regarding the presence of such qualities in all men only when we do not perceive anything to the contrary”, then our answer is that in regard to the matter under consideration, the mere suspicion to the contrary has the same effect as the actual perception of that contrary 
svarga apavarga mārga uktim niravadyām prasādhitām  | buddhānām tām jāḍāt kaḥ anyaḥ vyāmohāt abhiditim anyate || 	Who else except the fool can regard the teaching of the Buddhas as having its source in delusion,—when it has been proved to be the flawless exposition of the path to heaven and the final goal? 
dṛṣṭe api abhyudayam citta doṣa śāntim parām tathā | tatas ca āpnuvatām tena param vyāmohanam kṛtam || 	It is indeed a great delusion that has been brought about by Buddha in his disciples who, during the present life itself, have attained, through it, prosperity, as also the highest stage of the alleviation of all afflictions of the mind! 
veda mūlam ca na eva idam buddhānām upadeśanam | niṣkalaṅkam hi tat proktam sa kalaṅkam śrutau punar || 	The teaching of the Buddhas is certainly not based upon the Veda; because it has been described as ‘flawless’, while the Veda is full of flaws 
svārtha saṃsiddhaye teṣām upadeśaḥ na tādṛśaḥ | ārambhaḥ sakalaḥ tu eṣa parārtham kartum īdṛśaḥ || tasmāt jagat hita ādhāna dīkṣitāḥ karuṇa ātmakāḥ | anibandhana bandhu tvāt āhuḥ sarveṣu tat padam || 	The said teaching of the Buddhas is not for any selfish purpose; in fact, the whole effort was made for the benefit of others. Thus it was that the all-merciful Buddhas taught that path to all men,—having made up their minds to bring about the welfare of the world, and thus being the disinterested well-wishers of all beings 
ye hi lobha bhaya dveṣa mātsarya ādi vaśīkṛtāḥ  | prādeśikī bhavet teṣām deśanā niḥkṛpā ātmanām || karuṇā apatantrāḥ tu spaṣṭa tattva nidarśinaḥ  | sarva apavāda niḥśaṅkāḥ cakruḥ sarvatra deśanām || yathā yathā ca maurkhya ādi doṣa duṣṭaḥ bhavet janaḥ | tathā tathā eva nāthānām dayā teṣu pravarttate  || na eva āvāha vivāha ādi sambandhaḥ vāñchitaḥ hi taiḥ  | upakāraḥ tu karttavyaḥ sādhu gītam idam tatas 	Those teachers who were under the influence of greed, fear, hatred, jealousy, etc. and were devoid of mercy,—it is the teaching of such persons which could be partial and local 3570) Those teachers, on the other hand, who were led by mercy alone,—who had a clear perception of the truth,—who had no fear of any contradiction,—imparted their teachings to all. As a man, through ignorance, goes on being affected by defects, so there grows in the lords, mercy towards him.—They do not desire to establish any such connection with men as that of vivāha (marriage) or āvāha (home-coming of the bride) and so forth; the only thought in their mind is that of doing good to others. That is what has been so well sung of 
śataśas pratiṣiddhāyām jātau jātimadaḥ ca kim | tad anya atiśaya asiddhau viśiṣṭā sā ca kim matā || vaśi tva ādi guṇa ādhārāḥ prakṣīṇa aśeṣa kalmaṣāḥ | sarve api atra aviśeṣeṇa tad yoge ca vijātayaḥ || bhaveyuḥ yadi siddhyanti viśiṣṭāḥ tad samāśrayāḥ | vaiśiṣṭyam anyathā na eva lubdhaka dvija jāti vat 	Hundreds of times has the ‘genus’ (universal) been rejected; whence then is this pride due to ‘caste’ (genus)? specially when no superiority over others is perceived in it, why should it be regarded as superior? In fact, men belonging to other castes also are found, on the presence of particular qualities, to be the receptacle of qualities of self-control and free from all impurities. If, by reason of their connection with the particular (Brāhmaṇa) caste, they had been superior to others, in the matter of possessing the said qualifications, then alone could they be admitted to be really superior,—not if they merely belonged to the Brāhmaṇa caste, but in actual life were like fowlers, and others 
atītaḥ ca mahān kālaḥ yoṣitām ca ati cāpalam | tat bhavati api niścetum brāhmaṇa tvam na śakyate || atīndriya padārtha jñaḥ nahi kaścid samasti vaḥ | tvad anvaya viśuddhim ca nityaḥ vedaḥ api na uktavān || 	A very long time has elapsed and women are very unsteady; hence it cannot be certain if there is Brāhmaṇa-hood in you. For you, there is no one who is cognisant of supersensuous things; nor has even the Veda declared the purity of your genealogy 
atas manu ādayaḥ api eṣām avijñāta dvijātayaḥ | na upadeśam prayaccheyuḥ dvijebhyaḥ tad aniścayāt || 	Thus, Manu and other teachers, not knowing who were real Brāhmaṇas, could not have imparted the teachings to Brāhmaṇas alone: because they could not be sure of it 
niryuktika tvam veda arthe jñāpana aśakta tā ātmani  | veda adhīti jaḍāḥ viprāḥ na parīkṣā kṣamāḥ iti || kutaścid niścitam śaṅke nūnam manu ādibhiḥ tatas  | viprebhyaḥ eva veda ādeḥ kṛtam taiḥ upadeśanam || 	We suspect that Manu and other teachers, for some reason, came to realise that what is stated in the Veda is not quite reasonable and not quite comprehensible by itself,—And also that the Brāhmaṇas, having become dull-witted by the reading of the Veda, were incapable of discriminating things for themselves;—and it was for this reason that they expounded their teachings to the Brāhmaṇas alone 
purāṇam mānavaḥ dharmaḥ sa aṅgaḥ vedaḥ cikitsitam  | ājñā siddhāni catvāri na hantavyāni hetubhiḥ  || manye tena eva dattā iyam jaḍebhyaḥ taiḥ vibhīṣikā | ājñā siddha tvam anyatra vāc mātrāt kim nu vā bhavet || 	They have declared that]—“The Purāṇa, the dharmaśāstra propounded by Manu, the Veda with its subsidiaries, and the science of medicine,—these four are self-sufficient commandments, and should never be attacked with reasonings”,—this threat, in regard to the self-sufficiency of their authority, we think, was pronounced by them to the dull-witted people for the same reason. Or else, how could a mere verbal statement make anything self-sufficient in its authority?

naraḥ kopi asti sarvajñaḥ ityādi api na sādhanam | pratijñā nyūna tā doṣa duṣṭam iti upapāditam || niḥśeṣa artha parijñāna sādhane viphale api hi | sudhiyaḥ saugatāḥ yatnam kurvanti ityādinā purā || 	It has been explained that the proving of the proposition that ‘there is some man who is omniscient’ is not vitiated by the defect of falling short of our proposition 
eka deśajña gītam tu na syāt sarvajña bhāṣitam  | iti atra api purā proktam sarvajñāna anvayāt iti || yathā eva iṣṭa ādikān arthān anubhūya alpadarśanaḥ | cetasi āropya tān paścāt pravakti anubhava āśrayān || na ca tat vacanam tasya tat vastu jñāna janma na  | evam sarvajña vākyam syāt hetu bhedāt tu bhidyate || samasta vastu vijñānam asya kāraṇa tām gatam | kiñcid mātrā artha vijñānam nimittam tasya tu sthitam 	As regards the argument that “what is asserted by one who knows only a part cannot be regarded as the assertion of the omniscient person”,—the answer to this has already been given, that it would be due to the actual presence of the knowledge of all things 
vikalpa asambhave tasya vivakṣā nanu kīdṛśī | prahīṇa ācaraṇa tvāt hi vikalpaḥ na asya varttate || 	There being ho conceptual content in his case,—how could there, be any desire in him to speak? Inasmuch as he has renounced all activity, there can be no conceptual content for him.” 
na evam kliṣṭaḥ hi saṃkalpaḥ tasya na asti āvṛti kṣayāt | jagat hita anukūlaḥ tu kuśalaḥ kena vāryate || 	It cannot be so; because, as regards the conception that is beset with afflictions, no such is possible in his case, as all ‘obscuration’ has disappeared from him. while that conception which is favourable to the world’s welfare and hence ‘healthy’,—who would prevent that? 
na ca tasya vikalpasya saḥ arthavat tām avasyati  | tam hi vetti nirālambam māyākāra samaḥ hi asau || māyākāraḥ yathā kaścid niścita aśva ādi gocaram | cetaḥ nirviṣayam vetti tena bhrāntaḥ na jāyate || 	As a matter of fact, he does not recognise the conceptual content as beneficial (useful); he knows it to be baseless; he is like the magic-performer. The magic-performer knows that the idea that he has produced envisaging the real horse is really without an objective basis; and hence he himself does not become mistaken or misled by it

yadi evam īdṛśaḥ nyāyaḥ prasiddhaḥ nyāya vādinām | prasaṅga sādhane dharmaḥ śraddhā mātrāt paraiḥ mataḥ || yukti prasiddha tāyām ca svatantram sādhanam bhavet | īdṛśaḥ ca pareṇa iṣṭaḥ tad praṇītaḥ saḥ āgamaḥ || sambhāra āvedhataḥ tasya puṃsaḥ cintāmaṇeḥ iva  | niḥsaranti yathākāmam kuṭī ādibhyaḥ api deśanāḥ || ādhipatya prapattyā atas praṇetā saḥ abhidhīyate  | vikalpa anugatam tasya na vaktṛ tvam prasajyate 	If that is so, then, the principle accepted by all relationalists is that a reductio ad absurdum (in this case) can be urged only on the basis of a character that is accepted on mere faith; if it were based upon well-known reasons, there would be independent (direct) arguments in support. As a matter of fact, the scripture that is postulated by the other party (the Buddhist) as composed by the omniscient person, is as thus described—‘without any appurtenances, the teachings of that person proceed freely even from the walls,—as if they were coming out of the cintāmaṇi gem’.—Thus then it is purely through supervision that he is regarded as the ‘composer’ of the teachings; hence his speakership need not be associated with any conceptual content.—Thus then, when you assert that—“we are wanting in that faith and hence ask for reasons”—you do so without knowing what is meant by reductio ad absurdum 
kuṭī ādi niḥsṛtānām ca kasmāt na āpta upadiṣṭa tā | tadā ādhipatya bhāvena yadā tāsām pravarttanam || 	Why should words issuing from the walls not be accepted as taught by a reliable person,—when they are prompted by his over-lordship?

Even in regard to absolutely supersensuous things, the said teaching is not annulled by anything past or future; it prompts the manifestations of such qualities as compassion and the like; it is endowed with all forms, expounds right behaviour; it is conducive to various forms of welfare here and elsewhere; it teaches the antidote to all kinds of love, hatred and the rest; it opens the gate to the city of nirvāṇa.—If such teaching could be the work of playful persons or demons, then these same may be the ‘enlightened beings’, as fulfilling all the conditions of ‘enlightenment’! Merely by giving a different name to a thing, its real form does not become altered. In fact, if a man were to call the cultured ‘uncultured’,—he himself would be subject to the derision of all good people

Such words are likely to proceed only from persons who are addicted to such practices 
yugapad śuci aśuci ādi svabhāvānām virodhinām  | jñānam eka dhiyā dṛṣṭam na viruddhāḥ vidā hi te || 	The simultaneous apprehension by one and the same cognition of mutually contradictory things,—like the pure and the impure and so forth,—has actually been found. because they are not incompatible with cognition

eka jñāna kṣaṇa vyāpta niḥśeṣa jñeya maṇḍalaḥ | prasādhitaḥ hi sarvajñaḥ kramaḥ na āśrīyate tatas || 	The omniscient person whose existence we have established is one who comprehends within a single cognitive moment the entire round of all that is to be known; it is for this reason that no succession is admitted in this case

He knows things either simultaneously or in succession, just as he wishes; and having secured the knowledge of all things, he becomes the lord 3628-3629) Or, he knows all that is knowable, in the shape of the ‘four truths’, by means of his sixteen ‘cognitions’, in succession, and on that account he is omniscient. When this cognition of the lord thus appears in succession—not even a single moment has to be awaited; what to say, my friend, of a hundred years! The person who apprehends all things in their own undiversified form, knows the very forms of all things

tattva anya tva ādi anirdeśyam yat paraiḥ ca prakalpitam | sāmānyam tasya na etena grahaṇam yogi cetasā || 	What is apprehended by the mystic consciousness is not that universal which is incapable of being spoken of as ‘that’ or ‘not-that’ and so forth, and which other people have regarded as real’ 
avikalpam avibhrāntam tat yogi īśvara mānasam | vikalpa vibhrama ākrāntam tad grahe ca prasajyate || 	The consciousness of the mystic is free from conceptual content and is not erroneous; and if it apprehended the said universal, it would be something beset with conceptual content and error 
vikalpa ātmā ca sāmānyam avācyam yat prakīrtitam | nitya anugati rūpam tat nīrūpam pratipāditam || 	Because it has been already explained that the universal which consists of the conceptual content and is incapable of being spoken of, and is in the form of permanent contiguity,—is formless (featureless) 
sa hetu sa phalam karma jñānena alaukikena yaḥ | samādhi jena jānāti sa sarvajñaḥ apadiśyate || purastāt anumānena tasya sattā prasādhitā  | pramāṇam asya sadbhāve tat asti iti asti tādṛśaḥ || 	That person is certainly called ‘omniscient’ who knows all things along with their causes, through a single abnormal cognition brought about by communion. The existence of such a person has been already established before, by means of inference. Thus there is a distinct means of cognition vouching for his existence. Hence it follows that such a one really exists 
yugapad paripāṭyā vā jñānam kāryāt prakāśitāt | sāmarthyam api tasya asti deśanām kurute yadā || 	Simultaneously or successively, there is cognition following from the effect that is manifested. when he imparts the teaching, he has the requisite capacity also 
su abhyasta dharma nairātmyā yasya iyam deśanā amalā  | sādhitā sarva śāstra iṣuṇa sarva mānaiḥ abādhitā || saṃsāri anucita jñānā keśava ādeḥ agocaraḥ  | śirobhiḥ arcyate śaktyā yāca atīva manīṣibhīḥ  || samasta durita arāti varga bhaṅga vidhāyinī | citra abhyudaya niṣpatti nirvāṇa prāpti kāraṇam  || labdha asādhāraṇa upāyaḥ aśeṣa puṃsām viśeṣa lakṣaṇaḥ | saḥ ekaḥ sarva vid nāthaḥ iti etat sapramāṇakam 	That person who has propounded this teaching—which is pure and wherein the dharma of ‘no-soul’ has been reiterated,—and which has been supported by the whole of this work and not traversed by any form or means of valid cognition,—which is not known to worldly men,—which is beyond the ken of Keśava and others,—which is highly borne on the head by all wise men,—which destroys the entire host of enemies in the shape of evils,—and is the cause of various kinds op prosperity as also of the attainment of nirvāṇa,—such a person acquired special powers not common among men, which distinguishes him from all other men, and he alone is omniscient;—this is entirely vouched for by means and forms of right cognition 
ittham yadā ca sarvajñaḥ kaścid eva upapadyate | dharma ādi adhigame hetuḥ pauruṣeyam tadā vacaḥ || 	Thus, as it is quite conceivable that there is an omniscient person, human assertion can certainly be the means of providing the knowledge of dharma 
nirākāra ādi cintā tu sarvajñe na upayujyate | yathā hi bhavatām jñānam kvacid arthe tathā param || iti atīndriya darśi puruṣa parīkṣā | śāntarakṣita viraciḥ tatva saṅgrahaḥ samāptaḥ || 	Any discussion regarding formlessness and the rest is of no use in regard to the omniscient person. In fact, just as your cognition appears in regard to a certain object, so does the other (superior) cognition also
