We render obeisance to that immortal Brahman, the immeasurable bliss and knowledge, from whom as Lord with the two kinds of indeterminable Nescience as ministers, there are the illusory manifestations of ether, air, fire, water and the earthand from whom came forth this universe, movable and immovable, high and low.

Now, that of which there is no doubt or that which is profitless cannot be the sphere of a desire to know on the part of a prudent inquirer, as, for instance, a pot present in bright light and coming into contact with the sense of sight along with the mind or the teeth of a crow.

Further, he, who becomes a tiger by his yoga, experiences the self as nondifferent in spite of differences of the body hence, the body is not the substrate of Iness.

If that transmigration which is beginningless persists alongside the beginningless knowledge of the true nature of the self, how can there be the riddance of the former, there being no opposition between the two? And how can there bet nonexperience of the true nature of the self? Other than the experience of I, there is indeed no knowledge of the true nature of the self.

Raising a doubt, with these ideas in mind, the commentator answers it thus Of the spheres of the two concepts, etc. Here, the text from Of the spheres etc., up to etc., up to can properly be only illusion is the statement of the doubt.

The countercorrelate of the word I is not the word this, so much as the word thou, since there is seen extensive usage of expressions like We are this, we H are that .
citsvabhāva ātmā viṣayī,jaḍasvabhāvā buddhīndriyadehaviṣayā viṣayāḥ |	The self of the nature of intelligence is the sub ject vigayin, the nonintelligent intellect, organs, body and objects, are the objects of cognition visayas.

As an example of absolute differ ence, which is the ground of the impossibility of reciprocal superimposition, there is mentioned like darkness and light. Never indeed, can one understand such utterly different things as light and darkness each to be of the nature of the other.
tadidamuktam-itaretarabhāvānupapattau iti |	This is stated thus
itaretarabhāvaḥ ita-retaratvam, tādātmyamiti yāvat ; tasyānupapattā-viti |syādetat |	when it is established that one cannot intelligibly be of the nature of the other. The one being the other means the one having the nature of the other, that is to say, the identity of the one with the other this is unintelligible. Be this so.

itaretaratra dharmiṇi dharmāṇāṃ bhāvo vinimayaḥ,tasyānupapattiḥ |	To this it is said for their attributes too. The existence of the attributes of one substrate in the other, i.e., their mutual transfer this is unintelligible. This is the idea

Hence it follows by elimination that mutual transfer of the constantly associated attributes of the object and the subject is possible only on the basis of the reciprocal connec tion of these two. If these two substrates being apprehend ed as absolutely distinct are unrelated, their attributes are even more clearly unrelated, they being further removed from each other by the interposition of their respective sub strates.

Though they can properly be only illusion, yet this is the construction. This is the underlying idea. All this might be so, if the true nature of the self were manifest in the experi ence of the I.

It is thus the true nature of the self is declared in Scripture, traditional codes smrti, epics itihüsas, and mythologies purayas as undefined by any limiting conditions, as of the one consistency of endless bliss and intelligence, as indifferent, as one and without a second.

For, from repetition results the eminence of the object, as in Lo, beautiful, lo, beautiful!, not its littleness nor even figurativeness that being remote indeed.

Or how can it be undeluded experience? Nor can it be said that since Scripture is opposed to perception, which is the elder means of valid knowledge pramana, the former alone. as dependent on the latter should be declared invalid or figurative for, since that Scripture is not of human origin and is free from even the suspicion of any defect, and since its validity is selfrevealed by the very fact of its conveying knowledge, it is independent of any other means of knowledge in respect of its effect, i.e., valid knowledge.
pramitā-vanapekṣatve'pyutpattau pratyakṣāpekṣatvāttadvirodhādanutpatti-lakṣaṇamasyāprāmāṇyamiti cet, na, utpādakā-pratidvanhitvāt |	If it be said that though independent in respect of the knowledge it generates, yet since it is dependent on perception in respect of its origin, and since there is opposition to that perception, there will be the nonvalidity of Scriptural teaching, consisting in its nonproduction,no we reply for, there is no opposition to its origination by perception.
na hyāgamajñānaṃ sāṃvyavahārikaṃpratyakṣasya prāmāṇyamupahanti yena kāraṇābhāvānnabhavet;	Scriptural knowledge does not indeed annul the empirical validity of perception, whereby it would itself cease to be, because of the nonexistence of its cause rather does it annul the absolute validity of perception.

The priority of what is not depended on is a ground for its being sublated, not for its sublating another means of knowledge, for, it is seen that the earlier cognition of silver is sublated by the later cognition of nacre. If the former were not sublated, the origination of the latter cognition whose essence is the sublation of the former would not be inteiligible. And it has been shown that the absolute validity of perception is not depended on.
tathāca pāramarṣa sūtram – 'paurvāparye pūrvadaurbalyaṃ prakṛti-vat' iti |	Where there is the relationship of earlier and later, the earlier is weaker, weaker, as in the case of the archetypal rite prakrti. And to the same effect is the verse

Further, those who acknowledge the self as the substrate of Iness, even by them the truth of that cognition cannot be admitted, since in the judgement I am in this very abode, but cognising, the omnipresent self is apprehended as finite, in the same way as to the man on the ground, big trees on the top of a high peak appear as blades of grass. Nor is it admissible that the experienced finiteness is of the body, not of the self.

Further, when it is agreed as between the speaker and the understanding listener that a certain word has the connotation of another, then the use is secondary it follows in the wake of awareness of difference.

It is not however, determin ed that there is identity between taila and mustard oil.

Here, the pervader, viz., cognition of difference eliminating itself also elimi nates the secondary usage. Nor may it be said that though the bodies of youth and old age are different, yet, from the recognition of an identical self in the judgement I am he, it follows that there is an experience of the self as different from the body etc. Such a judgement is, verily, that of the critic, not of the man in the street.

vakṣyatyanantarameva hibhagavānbhāṣyakāra: —— paśvādibhiścāviśeṣāt 'iti|	Indeed, the revered commentator says this presently in the words And because there is no distinction from beasts etc. Even outsiders say

Hence by elimination we see fit to hold that finitude is understood of the self by the man in the street who says I am in this very abode etc., in the same way as ether is cognised as limited by pot, ewer, basin etc. Nor is it meet to say, in order to conserve the validity of the use of the word I, that the self too, like the body etc., is finite.

On the view of each part intelligising by itself, in the absence of a consensus among the many independent intelligences, either the body would be distracted or nonaction would result, as the consequence of simultaneous activity in opposed directions.

The concept of I having been in this way shown to be worthless as a rotten gourd, the revered Scripture may proceed unhindered to remove from the self notions conse quent on the experience of I, such as agency, enjoyership happiness, misery, grief etc. Hence, in the words after superimposing on each, etc., there are elaborated the nature, cause and result of the concept I, whose illusoriness is wellknown from all trustworthy Soripture, traditional codes, epics and puranas.

By iti in mamedam iti is indicated activity etc. suitable to the above experience.

Having thus stated the nature of superimposition and its fruit, viz., empirical usage, he states its cause in the words through nondiscrimination of each from the other, i.e., through nonapprehension of their distinctness.

Whence then the nonapprehension of the distinctness of the intelligent self? Whence the delusion of identity? To this he replies by coupling the true with the untrue. The construction is

Hence, of the intellect, organs, body etc., appearing in every prior illusory cognition, there is use in every subsequent instance of superimposition. This process being beginningless, like the succession of the seed and the sprout, there is no reciprocal dependence this is the meaning.

Thus, the body etc., since they are manifest, are not unreal, being like the intelligent self or else, if unreal, they cannot be manifest how then can there be the coupling of It may be asked what is this thing called super imposition? The reply is

But in any case, it does not depart from the property of one appearing as having the attributes of another.

Avabhūsa is that appearance which is terminated or depreciated.

The word seen is used to indicate that it the superimposed element counts only as phenomenal not as absolutely real. Even thus, what is now seen is not capable of being imposed hence the use of the word before.

Similarly, rays of light from the organ of sight come in contact with the pure mirror or sheet of water facing the cogniser, but they are reflected therefrom by the stronger rays of the Suns light, and coming into contact with the face, apprehend the face because of a defect, however, they do not apprehend the face as where it really is, i.e., not facing oneself, but impose on it the property of facing oneself that belongs to the formerly seen mirror or sheet of water. Thus, the definition applies to the delusion of reflection too.

This is what is said it is not that manifestation alone constitutes reality, in which case, bodies, organs etc., by the very fact of manifestation, would be real.

Nor is it admissible to ask thus in the mirage, the water is unreal, but in its own nature as mirage it is absolutely real whereas, the body, organs etc., are unreal even in their own nature, and as such cannot be the sphere of any experience how then can they be super imposed? For, if what is unreal cannot be the object of any experience, how then do the mirage etc., which are unreal, become the sphere of experience as water etc. ? Though real in their own nature, they the mirage etc. cannot become real as water etc., as well. It may be said there is nothing called nonexistence.

Hence, this, which may be explained as another mode of existence, may well be in the sphere of experience. The world, which is absolutely unreal, devoid of any capacity, devoid of any true essence, how can it be an object of experience ? How, again, can it be superimposed on the intelligent self? Nor is it admissible that, though the objects of experience are wholly devoid of any capacity to appear, the respective cognitions, through the capacity residing in them as cognitions, of themselves give rise to the appearance of the unreal, as a product of a unique nature, and that this capacity of the cognitions to make the un real appear is Nescience.

If it be said that the relation of cognition, which is real, to that which is unreal is that the former is made determinate under the control of what is unreal, lo! how very fortunate is this poor cognition that attains to determination even through the unreal.

If it be said that the cogni tion is not controlled by the unreal, but that it is of the very nature of cognition not to appear apart from the unreal, lo unfortunate indeed is this partiality for the unreal, whereby cognition is invariably linked to the unreal, though neither originating therefrom nor of the same nature as that. Hence, body, organs etc., which are wholly unreal and have no true essence, cannot become objects of experience. To this we reply if what has no true essence be not within the sphere of experience, are these rays real as water, in such wise that they may come within the sphere.

When apprehended as of the nature of water, however, how can it be nondelusive or nonsublated? Lo! then we reply of the rays whose nature is nonwaterness, their nature as waterness is not real, since they, being nondifferent from nonwaterness, cannot intelligibly be of the nature of waterness nor is it unreal for, it is recognised by you, in the words Non existence is existence in another form, not anything else, since no such thing is proved, that the unreality of one thing is but another thing.

Hence, the water superimposed on the rays has to be recognised to be indeterminable, being neither real nor unreal nor yet real and unreal, this last being selfcontradictory.

For this reason, in order to establish its indeterminability firmly, he says Some speak of it etc. Of the attribute of another, i.e., of the attribute of the cognition, here, of silver that is to say, of the form of the cognition.

For, if the substrate silver were sublated, then, both the silver and its attribute of thisness would be sublated it would be better to take it that the attribute thisness alone is sublated, not the substrate silver as well.

Thus follows the imposition outside of what is of the form of cognition. But some others, i.e., those who are not satisfied with the doctrine of imposition as of the form of cognition, say that when there is the superimposition of one on another, it is a delusion conditioned by the nonapprehension of their distinctness. They state the reason for their dissatisfaction.

The atma khyativadin may say delusive cognition determines its own form to be external and thus, its sphere is not the sub strate of the word I its being of the form of cognition is to be known from the sublating cognition.

Does that distinguish from silver the object present before us, or also show of it that its nature is of the form of cognition? The intelligence of that person beloved of the gods, who says of the sublating cognition that it has the function of making known the prior experi ence to have the form of cognition, is indeed to be praised! If it be said that its being of the form of cognition follows by presumption from the negation of the presence of silver before us, no we reply for, from the denial of the nonapprehension of nonproximity, it would become nonproximate to the cogniser whence then the extreme. proximity to the cogniser such that it is of his own nature ? And this sublating cognition denies neither the silver.

Or if manifestation be admitted, how can there be no opposition to experience? Further, since the senses etc., are seen to have the capacity to generate valid know ledge, how can illusory cognition result from them? If it be said that in conjunction with defects they acquire the capacity to generate illusory cognition, no we reply, since defects can cause only the counteraction of the generative capacity of a cause else even from the parched kutaja seed there would result the springing up of a banyan shoot.

This is the underlying idea it is knowledge common to all that because of the cognition this is silver, there is for him who seeks silver activity and appositional designation in respect of the substance in front of him.

Now, it has been said that it results not from bare nonapprehension, but from memory and apprehension, where their difference in respect of their nature and contents is not apprehended because of the similarity to the valid cognition of silver before us, they give rise to empirical usage as as nondifferent and appositional designation. To this, the supporter of anyathākhyāti replies Now, the similarity of this to the valid cognition may be the cause of empirical usage either by being appre hended, or by its bare existence, without being apprehended. Even if it be apprehended, the apprehension must be of the form Of the cognitions this and silver there is resemblance to valid cognition, or of the form Between those very two no difference is apprehended in respect of their nature or contents .

This is how we look at it since the empirical usage of an intelligent being cannot intelligibly be consequent on ignorance, it must be effective only as creating an imposed cognition. Now it may be objected it is true that the activity of an intelligent being is consequent not on ignorance, but on apprehension and memory whose distinctness is not known.

For, everyone superimposes an object on another object that is present before him and you say that the inner self, which is outside the concept of Thou, is a nonobject.
ucyate – na tāvadayamekāntenā-viṣayaḥ, asmatpratyayaviṣayatvāt, aparokṣa-pratyagātmaprasiddheḥ |	The reply is now, this is not invariably a nonobject, because it is the object of the concept I, and because of the immediacy of the realisation of the inner self.
na cāya-masti niyamaḥ puro'vasthita eva viṣayeviṣayāntaramadhyasitavyamiti |	And there is no rule that an object can be superimposed only on another object that is present before one.

This untruth is established in the case not only of inquirers, but also of the man in the street hence he says And thus is our experience in the worldnacre appears as if it were silver. This, again, is not silver this is the complement to the above sentence.

To this he says the moon, though one, appears as if having a second. In the words Again, how, etc., the superimposition. on the intelligent self is again objected to.

If it be not manifest, how can there be the superimposition of objects and their attributes thereon? There is not, verily, the superimposition of silver or its attributes on a non manifest substance in front of us. If this self is manifest, it does not stand to reason that it is inert, and manifested in dependence on another, like a pot etc. The self that is manifest should be either selfmanifest or manifested by another it is not the latter nor can it be the former. Verily, the same thing cannot be both agent and object, because of contradiction.

He who holds that consciousness is selfmanifest, but not the self, may say be this so.

This is not sound, because of opposition to Scripture.

If that were inert, both the object and the self would be inert which, then, would be manifest in which, there being no distinction among the three? Muy Thus would result nonmanifestation for the whole universe.

Nor may it be said that cognition, being itself hidden, yet makes known both the object and the self, like the sense of sight etc. which, themselves unperceived, yet cause perception for, to make known is to produce cognition, and the cognition that is produced, being inert, would not surmount the abovementioned defect of the blind leading the blind.

tasmādaparādhīnaprakāśā saṃvidu-petavyā |tathāpi kimāyātaṃ viṣayātmanoḥ svabhāvajaḍayo: ?etadāyātaṃ yattayoḥ saṃvidajaḍeti |	Therefore, consciousness should be acknowledged to be manifested without dependence on another. Even thus, what is gained by you for the object and the self, which you hold are both inert by nature? This is the gain.

It is of the very nature of the selfluminous consciousness to be related to the object and the self if this be said, alas! then, it is equally the nature of the scholarly son to be related to his father.

If this be said, is consciousness, then, different from the manifestation of consciousness on the one hand, and the manifestation of the object and the self on the other? If that were so, then, consciousness would no longer be selfmanifest, nor would consciousness be the manifestation of the object and the self.

Hence, what is desired to be stated by you that the self, itself inert, is the locus of the selfmanifest conscious ness does not result. Nor is there concomitance with the object in the case of that consciousness which has objects past and future for its sphere though such concomitance has been assumed in the argument so far.

Because of its inertness, you may say, the conjunction of the body and the self is not a manifestation of the object. Now, though this consciousness is self manifest unlike the aforesaid conjunction, its luminosity, like that of a glowworm, is only in respect of itself in respect of objects, however, it is inert this has been ex plained by the analogy of the scholarly sons father.
te hivicchinnadīrghasthūlatayānubhūyante; prakāśacāyaṃ anta-ro'sthūlo'naṇurahaskho'dīrghaśceti prakāśate;	Nor are objects of the very nature of light i.e., of con sciousness, as the Vijñänavadins say they are experienced as finite, as long or gross, while light manifests itself as internal, neither gross nor subtle, neither short nor long.

And no natural differentiation is experienced in this light as such so that there is no obstacle to its identity with the self, which is one.
na ca anirvācyārthabhedaḥ prakāśaṃ nirvācyaṃbhettumarhati, atiprasaṅgāt |	Nor can differences among objects, which are indeterminable, introduce differences into light, which is determinate, as that would prove too much.

That self, not being otherdependent for its manifesta tion, and being without parts, cannot be an object of cog nition. How, then, can there be the superimposition there on of the attributes of objects, i.e., of bodies, organs etc.? The word how in the commentary is in the sense of an objection.
ayukto'yamadhyāsa ityā-kṣepaḥ |	This superimposition does not stand to reason this is the objection.

To this he says For, every one superimposes an object upon another object that is present before one. This is what is said that, whose manifestation is otherdependent and which has parts, appears other than what it is, being appre hended in its general nature, but not apprehended in its speci fic nature, because of defect in the organs of cognition.

Nor has it any parts, in which case, it could be apprehended in some part, but not in others.

Why then can there be no superimposition? To this he says which is ever outside the concept of Thou. For, if the intelligent self were the object, the subject vişayin would be other than that. And thus, he who is the subject is himself the intelligent self the object, however, should be admitted to be other than that, and in the sphere of the concept of Thou.

Hence it has been wellsaid

Hence on the inner self, which is never manifest, how can there be superimposition? To this he says
pratīca ātmanaḥ prasiddhi: prathā, tasyāaparokṣatvāt |	and because of the immediacy of the realisation of the inner self. Pratha is the realisation of the inner self, because of the immediacy thereof.
yadyapi pratyagātmani nānyāprathāsti tathāpi bhedopacāraḥ, yathā 'puruṣasyacaitanyam' iti |	Though, in the inner self, realisation is not some thing other than that, yet the difference implied in the words realisation of the self is figurative, as in the in telligence of the self.

Having given this real answer, he states as a praudha vadin another answer, assuming the mediacy of the intelligent self self And there is no rule etc. Only on another object present before one, i.e., only on what is immediate directly perceived.
kasmādayaṃ na niyama ityata āha-apratyakṣe'pi iti | hiryasmādarthe |	Why is there no such rule? To this he says For, upon ether, though not perceptible etc. The particle hi means for the reason that.

H Now, there are thousands of superimpositions why should this particular one be expounded through the statement of objection and answer? Why not the general nature alone of superimposition be expounded? To this he says This aforementioned superimposition of this there is the superimposition of one on another, the latter is not affected, even to the extent of an atom, by the good or bad features produced by the former.

Hence it is said wise men hold etc. Now, this Nescience associated with impressions. which are beginningless, deeprooted and dense, cannot be removed, there being no means therefor to him who thinks so, the means for removing it is declared thus and, as distinct from that, the determination, i.e., know ledge not subject to doubt of the nature of the thing, they, i.e., wise men call knowledge.

Therefore, perception and other means of valid knowledge and the sacred teachings have reference to one characterised by Nescience. An objection is raised How, again, is it that percep tion and other means of valid knowledge have reference to one characterised by Nescience? Valid knowledge or vidya is, verily, determination of the truth

When one devoid of the conceit of I and mine in the body, senses etc.. devoid of the super imposition of the nature and attributes of the self, cannot intelligibly be a knower, the functioning of the means of valid knowledge is unintelligible. This is the meaning
ayamarthaḥ— pramātṛtvaṃ hi pramāṃ prati kartṛtvam |	to be a knower is to be an agent in respect of knowledge and that is independence in respect of the cognitive act.

Superimposition of the self would, then, be superfluous. To this he says by a body, on which is not superimposed the nature of the self, can anything be operated for, otherwise, functioning would result even in dreamless sleep this is the idea.

Just as a weaver is an agent in the case of the cloth, without superimposing his nature on the shuttle etc., but by operating them, even so without superimposing his nature on the body, organs etc., but by operating them, he who knows them the body, organs etc. may become a knower. To this he says And, when none of these, i.e., reciprocal superimposition of nature and attributesis present, the unattached self, different, in all ways and at all times, from all attributes and substrates, cannot intelligibly be a knower.

ātathādhyāsāśrayāṇi pramā-ṇānītyāhana ca pramātṛtvamantareṇa pramāṇa-pravṛttirasti |	this is the meaning. Necessarily, there fore, the means of valid knowledge are located in superim position.
pramāyāṃ khalu phale svatantraḥ pramātābhavati |	And without knowership, there can be no activity of the means of valid knowledge. He, verily, becomes a knower, who is independent in respect of the fruit, valid knowledge.

How, again, could this have the intelligent self as agent, if the functioning internal organ were not superimposed on the intelligent self? Hence, from reciprocal superimposition, there results the fruit called valid know ledge, which resides in the intelligent self as agent when that results, there results knowership.

pramātṛtvena ca pramāupalakṣyate | pramāyāḥ phalasyābhāve pramāṇaṃ napravarteta |	By the use of the word knower ship, valid knowledge is also implied. If the fruit, valid knowledge, were nonexistent, the means of valid knowledge would not be active and thus the means of valid knowledge would cease to be such

Rais ing this objection, he says

Indeed, since, in the absence of a relation to another world for the person who desires Heaven, the sacred teaching relating to eligibility cannot carry on, it has to postulate that much alone by implication, not his freedom from the migratory cycle too for, this is of no service in respect of eligibility the person propounded in the Upanişads, being neither agent nor enjoyer, is, rather, opposed to eligibility.

How can a nonenjoyer be the enjoyer of the enjoyments that are the fruit produced by the acts? Hence, the sacred teaching relating to prescriptions and prohibitions sets out in respect of that human being, who has a conceit of agency, enjoyership, brahminhood etc., acquired through beginningless Nescience.
evaṃ vedāntā apyavidyāvatpuruṣaviṣayāeva |	Thus, the Vedantas too have refe rence only to the person characterised by Nescience for, there is not the understanding of their sense, in the absence of the distinction of the knower eto.

Hence, it is established that the sacred teachings have reference only to persons characte rised by Nescience.

Thus, because of the sense of each part being destructive of that of the other, the whole of the Veda would lose its authority as a means of valid knowledge.

na na ca parasparaparāhatiḥ,vidyāvidyāvatpuruṣabhedena vyavasthopapatteḥ |	Nor is there reciprocal annulment, since a differentiation of their respective spheres is intelligible, on the basis of the difference in the persons to whom they relate as characterised by knowledge or Nescience.

This is a summary way of stating what was said earlier, that it is the appearance elsewhere, with a nature like to that of recollection, of what was seen before.

Nor, as in the case of observances succeeding to the knowledge of ritual, is there anything succeeding to Brahmanknowledge, in view of which, that knowledge would be a secondary benefit. The supreme benefit, rather, is Brahmanknowledge alone, free from all doubt, this knowledge, which is of the nature of the cessation of all misery and is of the one essence of bliss, being conveyed by the Vedantas, whose content is known through the mode of argumentation called Brahmamimamsa.

Thus, as indicating the doubt and the benefit that are the causes of the skilled inquirer setting out on this sacred teaching, it is meet that the aphorism should be at the commencement of the sacred teaching hence, the revered commentator says In the sacred teaching of the Vedanta inquiry, which is proposed to be explained , by us this is the first aphorism. The word mīmāmsā signifies an inquiry that commands respect.

Having thus explained the purport of the aphorism, he explains the first word of it, then In this, the word then is accepted as having the sense of immediate succession. The word then, occurring among the words of the aphorism, has the sense of immediate.

Because the desire to know Brahman cannot be what is begun. In this aphorism, the desire to know appears from the wording to be more important than Brahman or knowledge thereof.

Thus, the aphorism comes to mean that the desire to know Brahman is to be undertaken every day as causing auspiciousness. To this he says and auspiciousness has no syntactical relation with the meaning of the sentence. It is the meaning of a word that, verily, has syntactical relation with the meaning of the sentence and that former is either expressed or implied.

And there would also be conflict with the text of the traditional Code, which says The two words Om and atha burst out of yore from the throat of Brahman hence both are auspicious. Reply to this he says Indeed, the word atha, only when used in TO another sense, can bring about auspiciousness by the mere sound of it. The word The word atha, used in the sense of immediate succession etc., produces auspiciousness, like the sound of the flute, the lyre etc., by the sound, i.e., by the mere hearing of it, and thus helps to bring about auspi ciousness, like the sight of the pitcher of water brought for a different purpose.
tena na smṛtivyākopaḥ |	Thus, there is no conflict with the text of the traditional Code.

Here, the word atha occurring in the interrogative states an alternative view after stating a preliminary view, with reference to the atha occurring earlier. Of that second word, imme diate succession is not the sense, since it is separated from the earlier occurring word by the statement of the preliminary view.

Never does it happen that one asks Is the self eternal or is the intellect non eternal? Hence, even without the sense of immediate succession, why should it not be that the word atha TO depends on what goes before? To this he says and refe rence to what has gone before does not, in effect, differ from immediate succession. This is the meaning
asyārthaḥphalata ānantaryāvyati-na vayamānantaryārthatāṃ vya-sanitayā rocayāmahe, kiṃ tu brahmajijñāsāhetubhūta-pūrvaprakṛtasiddhaye |	we prefer the sense of immediate succession not because of eager ness, but rather in order to secure some antecedent factor, which will serve as the cause of the desire to know Brahman.
sā ca pūrvaprakṛtārthāpekṣatve'pyatha-śabdasya sidhyatīti vyartha ānantaryārthatvāvadhāraṇā-graho'smākamiti |	Since that sense results even on the view that the word atha is dependent on what goes before, any eagerness of ours to fix the sense of that word as immediate succession would be in vain.

But, in reality, it is in stating another view, that there is dependence on what goes before and since, here, there is no statement of an alternative view, by elimination, immediate succession alone is left as the sense this is the correct view. ww Let immediate succession be the sense what of it? To this he says And when the meaning is.

That not being known, there does not arise cognition of its own content i.e., Religious Duty and Brahman and the apprehension of it Scripture follows necessarily even from the rule as to study one should study ones own section of the Veda. Hence, im mediate succession to the study of the Veda alone is the meaning of the word atha, even in the case of the desire to know Brahman.

And here, by the words ones own Veda referring to the content, the content thereof, viz., study, is implied. And this succession being understood even from the aphorism Then, therefore, the desire to know Religious Duty, the present aphorism need not be begun at all for, the word dharma used in the above sutra implies the entire sense of the Vedas, and Brahman, like Religious Duty, being equally the sense of the Vedas, the teaching about immediate succession to the study of the Veda applies equally to both

Now, those whose intellects are impure to start with cannot from the first understand the validity of the identity asserted by the text That thou art between the ja denoted by the thou, whose nature is that of agent and enjoyer, and the supreme self denoted by the that, whose nature is eternally pure, intelligent and indifferent, because of the certainty that there is lack of compatibility between the denotations of the two terms. But those of pure intellect, whose internal impurities have undergone attrition by means of sacrifices, gifts, austerities and fasting, and who are endowed with faith, having understood the compatibility of that and thou , will understand their identity. If this be urged, then, of the ascertainment of compatibility, which is the cause of the valid knowledge, do you resolve to say that it comes from ritual, which is itself not a means of valid knowledge pramana, or that ritual too is a means of valid knowledge, in addition to perception etc.? If the ascertainment of compatibility is effected by reasoning unopposed to the Vedanta and based on it, there is no need for ritual.

Hence, it stands to reason that the internal organ perfected by the contemplation of the meaning of sentences of indubitable import, manifests, of the immediately experienced denotation of the thou, its nature as the denotation of the that, through negating the various conditioned forms of the former.

The attributes of purity, intelligence etc. do not in truth gol beyond that i.e., are not different from that.

If it be said that there is need of ritual for contempla tion in respect of the generation of the psychosis of the internal organ, i.e., intuition of Brahman, no we reply, for, cooperation with ritual is unintelligible, since there is no copresence of contemplation and the observance of ritual. Nor, verily, can he, who from texts like “That thou art indubitably understands the one self. other than the body, whose nature is purity, intelligence and indifference, who is endowed with nonagency etc., who is devoid of castedistinctions like brahmin etc., understand TO eligibility for himself in respect of ritual.

It may be said that though the truth is ascertained, activity conditioned by error is seen to continue for example, though it is known for certain that sugar is sweet, yet there is the continued experience of bitter taste for him whose sense is affected by bile, for he tastes sugar, spits it out and thus abandons it.

And of its destroyer, ritual, whence the destruction? For, instances are extensively seen of entities which destroy them selves and others of the same class as themselves for example, goats milk digests itself and other milk, poison cures other poison as well as itself, the dust of the alearingnut mixed with muddy water precipitates both itself and the mud and makes the water olear even so, ritual, though of the nature of Nescience, drives away other Nescience and itself departs.

That is here said even prior to the knowledge of ritual desire to know Brahman is intelligible in respect of one who has studied the Vedanta.

Otherwise the Scripture Or, if otherwise, from the students order of life would be contradicted. The discharge of obligations, even by the householder, is only for the purification of the intellect. The statements about what is prescribed when one dies of old age, about being reduced to ashes and about the final rite antyesti relate to those ignorant ones who are inertly fixed in the observance of ritual, not to those learned ones who know the true self. Hence, the word atha connotes immediate succession to that, in the absence of which T TO there would be no desire to know Brahman, and in the presence of which that desiro certainly becomes existent.

By all this, TO nonattachment is indicated as essential. Hence it is that Scripture says

Nor is there any authority such as direct statement or the like for a relationship of subsidiary and principal, as between the desire to know Religious Duty and the desire to know Brahman. Now, there is seen a rule of sequence, even where there is no relationship of subsidiary and principal, as in the case of the milkpail godohana, which secures a human goal, in relation to the subsidiaries of the darsapürnamasa sacrifice, or as in the case of the darsapürnamusa and the soma sacrifice mentioned in Having performed the darsapūrņamāsa, one should perform the soma sacrifice, which do not stand in the relationship of subsidiary and principal.

Religious Duty, the object of the desire to know, has to come into existence, and does not exist at the time of knowing, because it is dependent. on the activity of the person.

TO What comes into existence has to be brought about by the operation of an operator, is dependent on that, and is hence nonexistent prior to that, i.e., when it is known What exists is true it is invariably real, not unreal at any time this is the meaning.

And that teaching relates to bhavana, i.e., human operations that are taught by itself, and also to the content thereof, i.e., sacrifice etc. sacrifice etc. are the content of bhāvanā, since the opera tion consisting in effort is determined in dependence on that sacrifice etc., and since the word vişaya content is derived from the root şi, to bind so that the content is what the effort is bound to.

The teaching about Brahman, however, merely instructs the person, but does not instruct him as directing him to activity.

Now, it may be said a person is taught Brahman by Vedanta texts like The self is to be known, which purport to be injunctive, only by directing him to the knowing activity, because of syntactical unity with that apparently injunctive text hence, there is similarity of the teaching of Brahman to the teaching of Religious Duty.

dāntike yoja-yati — tadvat iti |	as in the case of the knowledge of an object produced from the contact of the sense organ with the object. He links up what is illustrated, in the words
api cātmajñānavidhipareṣuvedānteṣu nātmatattvaviniścayaḥ śābdaḥ syāt |na hi tadā ātmatattvaparāste, kiṃ tu tajjñāna-iti |	so is it here. Further, in those Vedanta texts, whose purport is to enjoin knowledge of the self, the ascertainment of the true nature of the self cannot be knowledge gained from verbal testimony for, their purport would then be not the true nature of the self, but injunctions to the knowledge thereof.

Nor does ascertainment of the true nature of what is taught result even from that, the purport of which is something else, on the ground that knowledge depends on what is known and stands in need of it for, this dependence is intelligible even through super imposition i.e., the knowledge need not be of the true nature of what is known. Hence it is settled that the Vedanta has not for purport an injunction to knowledge.
yasminnasati brahmajijñāsā na bhavatisati tu bhavantī bhavatyevetyarthaḥ |	Therefore, some thing has to be stated etc. That in the absence of which there would be no desire to know Brahman, that in the presence of which, however, that desire becomes certainly existent this is the sense.

Hence it should be explained thus

From the contemplation arising from this kind of dis crimination of things eternal and noneternal, there results for him nonattachment to the enjoyment of fruit here or here. after.

This is what is meant thereby therefore, because of revelation, which declares the diminution of enjoyment in heaven etc., and the knowledge of Brahman as the supreme human goal, there results the possession of the abovementioned means in abundance and thence it is settled there is the desire to know Brahman. The compound word brahmajijāsa is thus explained Desire to know in respect of Brahman. By showing the compound to be of the sixth case, the refutation is to be understood of the explanation of this by earlier com mentators as a fourth case compoundbrahmane jijnäsa.

The word Brahman is used of the brahmin caste, as in brahmahatti brahminicide, of the Veda, as in brahmojjham forgetting the Veda once studied, and of the supreme self, as in He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman itself.

Thus, the things that serve the desire to know Brahman, such as the nature of Brahman, the valid means of knowing it, reasoning, the means of attainment and the fruit, all signified by the name desire to know Brahman, are comprehended under the name desire to know Brahman, since they are they are related to Brahman directly or indirectly. In the sixth case with the sense of object, however, what is signified by Brahman is the object that is only the nature of Brahman and the means of knowledge etc. would not be comprehended hence, in respect of the means of knowledge etc., the in quiry would be into what was not premised.

Knowledge is not, verily, determined in the absence of what is to be known, nor the desire to know in the absence of knowledge hence, because of being bound up with the attainment of it, the desire to know primarily needs an object alone, not what is related in general for, even in the absence of this latter, that desire is determined, when the object exists.

There is, however, when one says knowledge , the search for the object, in the form What is its object? Hence, because of being primarily needed, Brahman is related as object alone, not as what is related in general, this sense being secondary.

Now, it is true that the desire to know is not determined in the absence of what is desired to be known but there may be some other object for this desire, while Brahman may be related to it as a residuary.

The designation of the relationship as direct and direct and indirect s TO Now, it is not in vain, since it would have the purpose of premising inquiry into everything, without residue, that is dependent on Brahman if this be said, no because on the acceptance of the principal, whatever is dependent on it will be presumptively implied.

If that does not give knowledge of it, whence then its the sustras authoritativeness in that respect? Nor does any other means of valid knowledge apply in respect of Brahman. Hence, since in the case of what is known, though it can be known, there is no desire to know, and in the case of what is not known, it is not the object of desire and cannot be known, Brahman cannot be the object of the desire to know this is the objection.

Here, by the words.

Always free, always pure, it yet appears so i.e., nondifferent from the body ete, because of delusion due to the influence ef beginningless Nescience.

TO If, then, in the world, Brahman is wellknown as the self, in that case, since it is already known, it follows again that it is not to be desired to be known.

pariharati-na;	He answers this
kutaḥ ?tadviśeṣaṃ prati vipratipatteḥ | tadanenavipratipattiḥ sādhakabādhakapramāṇābhāve sati saṃśaya-bījamuktam |	No. Why not? Because there are conflicting views as to its particular nature. Such conflicting views are said to be the seeds of doubt, in the absence of any means of valid knowledge to confirm or confute.
asti tadvyatirikta īśvaraḥ sarvajñaḥsarvaśaktiriti kecit |	There is, as different from that, the Lord, omniscient and omnipotent, say some.
ātmā sa bhoktu-rityapare |	The self he is of the enjoyer, say others.
evaṃ bahavo vipratipannā yukti-vākyatadābhāsasamāśrayāḥ santaḥ |	Thus many people hold different views, basing themselves upon reasoning and texts both sound and fallacious.
tatrāvicārya yatkiṃcitpratipadyamāno niḥśreyasā-tpratihanyeta, anarthaṃ ceyāt |	Of these, he, who without inquiry accepts any, will fall from beatitude and attain to evil.
tasmādbrahma-jijñāsopanyāsamukhena vedāntavākyamīmāṃsātadavirodhitarkopakaraṇā niḥśreyasaprayojanāprastūyate ||bhāvaḥ |	Therefore beginning with statement of the desire to know Brahman, there is begun a respectful inquiry into the Vedanta texts, whose auxiliary is reasoning not inconsistent therewith, and whose purpose is beatitude.
vivādādhikaraṇaṃ dharmī sarvatantrasiddhānta-siddho'bhyupeyaḥ ; anyathā anāśrayā bhinnāśrayāvā vipratipattayo na syuḥ |	The substrate, which is the basis of dispute, should be admitted to be established by the conclusions of all systems else, there would be no conflicting views, these having either no basis or different bases.
viruddhā hi pratipattayovipratipattayaḥ ; na cānāśrayāḥ pratipattayo bhavanti,anālambanatvāpatte ;	Vipratipattis are, verily, conflicting views and views cannot have no basis, as then they would have nothing to rest on.
na ca bhinnāśrayā viruddhāḥ |na hi 'anityā buddhi: ' ' nitya ātmā' itipratipattivipratipattī |	Nor do those views conflict which have different bases. The views that the intellect is noneternal and that the soul is eternal are not, truly, conflicting views.
tasmāttatpadārthasya śuddhatvā-dervedāntebhyaḥ pratītiḥ, tvaṃpadārthasya ca jīvātmanolokataḥ siddhiḥ sarvatantrasiddhāntaḥ |	Hence, it is the con clusion of all systems that the purity etc. of the denota tion of the that are known from the Vedantas, while the jiva denoted by the thou is established by experience.

Therefore, since, in respect of the substrate known in a general way, there are conflicting views as to the H TO particulars of its nature, doubt in respect of these particulars is reasonable. Of these, he shows first the conflicting views about the denotation of the thou, in the words beginning with The ordinary man and ending with enjoyer alone, not agent.
atra dehendriyamanaḥkṣaṇika vijñāna caitanyapakṣena tatpadārthanityatvādayaḥ tvaṃpadārthena saṃbadhyante, yogya-tāvirahāt |	Here, on the views of intelligence as body, sense, mind or momentary cognition, the eternality etc. of the denotation of the that cannot relate to the denotation of the thou, because of lack of compatibility.

Of the forms of agent and enjoyer too, there is certainly lack of consonance with the eternality etc. of the denotation of the that, because of mutability.

On the view that selves though not enjoyers are many, there continues the same lack of consonance with the denotation of the word that, because of the noneternality etc. resulting from definition as a plurality and because of the abandonment of nonduality.

tat itijīvātmanaḥ parābhṛśati |	There is, as different from that, the Lord.
na kevalaṃ śarīrādibhyaḥjīvātmabhyo'pi vyatiriktaḥ |	to the jizaselves. He is different not merely from the body etc., but also from the jivaselves.

Even this ruler, being different from the jinaselves, cannot have an appositional relation with the denotation of the thou hence, he states his own view thus
bhokturjī-vātmano'vidyopādhikaraya sa īśvaraḥ tatpadārtha ātmā;tata īśvarādabhinno jīvātmā, paramākāśādivaghaṭākāśādaya ityarthaḥ |vipratipattīrupasaṃharan vipratipattibījamāha-evaṃ bahava iti |	The self, he is of the enjoyer, say others. Of the enjoyer i.e., of the jivaself conditioned by Nescience, he, the Lord, the denotation of the that, is the self hence, nondifferent from the Lord is the jiraself, as the potether etc. from the ether at large this is the sense.
yuktiyuktyābhāsavākyavākyā-bhāsasamāśrayāḥ santa iti yojanā | nanusantu vipratipattayaḥ tannimittaśca saṃśayaḥ;	In finishing with the conflicting views, he states the cause of these views Thus, many etc. They base themselves on reasoning, sound or fallacious, and on texts, soundly or unsoundly interpreted this is the construction.
tathāpikimarthaṃ brahmamīmāṃsā ārabhyate ityata āha—tatrāvicārya iti |	Now, let there be conflicting views, and let doubt be their cause even so, why should the inquiry into Brahman be commenced? To this he says
tattvajñānācca niḥśreyasādhigamaḥ,nātattvajñānādbhavitumarhati |	Of these, he, who without inquiry etc. Beatitude can come from knowledge of the truth, not of untruth.
api ca atattva-jñānānnāstikyesati anarthaprāptirapītyāha-anartha ca iti |	Further, if TO because of untrue knowledge there is loss of faith, evil too follows, he says
sūtratātparyamupasaṃharati-tasmāt iti |	and attain to evil etc. He concludes the purport of the aphorism
vedāntamīmāṃsā tāvattarka eva,tadavirodhinaśca ye'nye'pi tarkā adhvaramīmāṃsāyāṃnyāye ca vedapratyakṣādiprāmāṇyapariśodhanādiṣūktāḥte upakaraṇaṃ yasyāḥ sā tathoktā |	Therefore etc. The inquiry into the Vedantas is but reasoning other reason ing, which does not conflict therewith, such as is mentioned. in the Parvamimams and in the Nygasútras, in discussing the authoritativeness of the Vedas, of perception etc. that of which these are auxiliaries is thus mentioned.
tasmātparamaniḥ-śreyasasādhanabrahmajñānaprayojanā brahmamīmāṃsā ārabdha-vyeti siddham |brahma jijñāsitavyamityuktam |	Hence, it is established that the inquiry into Brahman, which brings about the knowledge of Brahman, the means to supreme beatitude, should be commenced. Brahman, it has been said, is to be desired to be known.

Here, though, from the premising of the knowledge of the nature of Brahman as the principal, its sub sidiaries such as the means of valid knowledge etc. are also premised, yet since its nature is the princi pal, that alone is first established by objection and answer. Whatever is experienced in any way is limited, impure, nonintelligent and destructible by the knowledge of these cannot be defined the nature of Brahman, which is opposed to them, being of the nature of eternal purity and intelligence.
na hi jātu kaścitkṛtakatvena, janma utpattiḥ ādiḥ asya – ititadguṇasaṃvijñāno bahuvrīhiḥ |	No one ever defines the eternal by what is produced. Nor can it be defined by its own attributes What begins with janma, i.e., origination thus it is an adjectival compound indicating its own attribute.
janmasthiti-bhaṅgaṃ samāsārthaḥ |	The meaning of the compound is
janmanaścāditvaṃ śruti-nirdeśāpekṣaṃ vastuvṛttāpekṣaṃ ca |	origination, sustenta tion and destruction. And of origination the primacy depends on both statements of Scripture and the nature of things.

To this he says Of this universe differentiated by name and form etc. Here, by the qualification differentiated etc., causation by an in telligent being is postulated, whereby is ruled out causation by nonintelligent entities like the pradhana or by what be conceived by the mind, that omniscient and omnipotent cause whence there is the origination, sustentation and destruction that is Brahman is the complement of the sentence in the aphorism.

In respect of that Brahman, is no means of know ledge to be followed other than verbal testimony ? Then, whence reflection ? And whence the intuition which is the experience thereof? To this he says While, however, there are the Vedanta texts etc. Inference should be understood to be of that variety which is not in conflict with the Vedanta and also dependent on it.

Nor is it that, as in the desire to know Religious Duty, Scripture etc. alone are the authority, in the case of the desire to know Brahman on the contrary, here Scripture etc., as also experience etc. are means of valid knowledge, as and when applicable, since the knowledge of Brahman culminates in experience Be this so.

Indeed, in respect of what is to be done, authoritativeness can belong only to Scripture etc., since there is no dependence on experience, and since what is to be done derives its existence in dependence on a person.

The prohibited contact of human bones and the wearing of them are opposed to each other, but are not equally strong hence, there is no option but of the general rule prohibiting contact, there is sublation by the special rule, the content. of the prescription to wear.

As for the knowledge of the truth, that is dependent not on the intellect, but on the thing hence, it is appropriate to ascertain the nature. of things therewith, not through doubt etc. thus, he says The knowledge of the true nature of a thing not etc. Then, this being the case, the knowledge of Brahman too depends on the thing itself, because its content is an existent thing.

No, because, not being a content of the senses, the relation is not apprehended.

Scripture establishes omniscience Of the great body of sacred teaching comprising the Rgveda etc. Rgveda etc. are sustras sacred teachings inasmuch as they teach disci ples the procedure in regard to all obligatory, occasioned and optional rites belonging to the four castes and four orders, from impregnation to cremation, all acts to be performed from the hours of dawn to those of the evening, as also the truth about Brahman hence too, since they relate to great themes, they are great.

The Jaiminiyas, who do not believe in a creation or destruction, teach a beginningless and uninterrupted study of the Veda, through a succession of teachers and pupils like ourselves. But those who follow the teaching of Vyasa say that, though, according to the doctrine of creation and destruction established in Scripture, the traditional Code, epics etc., the supreme self, who because of His association with beginningless Nescience is omnipotent and omniscient, is the creator of the eternal Vedas, He is not entirely free in respect of them, since He creates their sequence in such manner as to conform to the earlier ones this is in the same way as sacrifice and brahminicide, which, though illusory effects of Brahman, do not change their nature in a fresh creation, in respect of their leading respectively to good and evil.

The Jaiminlyas too prefer to understand by not being of human origin apauruşeyatva the absence of entire freedom for the person who creates.

The reply is there, the sacred teaching has not been have been banished, even though he is but one.

Here, you being questioned will have to explain this is the dependence of human statements because of their reference to existent things or because of their being human? If because of the reference to existent things, then would result non authoritativeness even for perception etc., as reciprocally dependent for, they too certainly refer to existent things.

To this we say what, again, O longlived one , is this which is to be done, which cannot be known by man? If it be said to be the unseen potentiality apurva, how, alas, does it come to be the significance of the imperative suffix lin etc. ? For, that apürva being transexperiential, there is no knowledge of the relation of the word to that in conformity with ordinary language, from the imperative suffix etc. there are understood only acts within experience, as what is to be done.

If this be said, it would follow, alas, that even in texts enjoining obeisance in a caitya a Buddhist shrine, there is, because of relation to such words as desire for heaven etc., the unseen potentiality which is to be done and thus, creation even of these being impossible, non human origin would result for them too. Or, if because their human origin is clearly seen, their signifying an unseen potentiality be denied, then, since human origin may be inferred of the Vedantas too, their being composed of sentences eto.

Thus, of the two combinations of words he howled and silver is not to be given as dakṣiņā through inference is understood the authoritative nature of the sacred teaching, in which case there would be the need for an example seen elsewhere.

Now, since authoritativeness is not seen for any other part of the Veda, which is not related to an injunction, how could this authoritativeness occur for the Vedantas, which are not related thereto? To this he says “And not through inference is understood etc. For, the autho ritativeness of the means of valid knowledge consists in their generating knowledge which is unsublated, not already understood, and indubitable and that, it has been explained, is intrinsic not made known by anything else, e.g., inference based on practical efficiency.

Otherwise, since it is not seen that colour is manifested by any other sense, it would follow that the sense of sight too could not manifest colour.

Verily, the Vedantas cannot have the existent Brahman for purport, their relation thereto as the signi fied not being known.

In the case, however, of the cognition of what is to be done, existing in another man there are probans, viz., the engaging in or the cessation from activity hence, because of the relation to the signified not being known, the Vedantas do not have the form of Brahman for purport.

Therefore, their having for purport the bare nature of Brahman is annulled by their wellknown character of being sacred teaching. Further, we do not see any purposefulness for these, whose purport is the teaching of the nature of Brahman. Nor, just as, from the ascertainment, somehow through secondary implication, of the true sense of the sentence this is a rope, not a snake, there is the cessation of fear, trembling etc., is there, similarly, from the under standing of the sense of the text That thou art, the cessation of the attributes of transmigration for, there is continuance as before of those attributes even for the person who has heard the sense of the text. Further, if for him who has heard of Brahman there occurs the cessation of the attributes of transmigration, why is it, then, that on top of the hearing, reflection etc. are found declared? Hence, because of this too, that there would result their futility, the Vedantas have not the nature of Brahman for purport, but have for purport what is to be done, whose content is the contemplation of the self.
tacca kārya svātmani niyojyaṃniyuñjānaṃ niyoga iti ca mānāntarāpūrvatayā-pūrvamiti cākhyāyate |	And this which is to be done as enjoining him who is enjoined in respect of itself is called an injunction niyoga, and, as not seen through any other means of knowledge, it is called the unseen apürva.

Just as the thing to be done, since it has to be determined in dependence on its own content, is determined by that content contemplation, even so, since contemplation cannot be determined without its content the self, for the sake of its determination, this very thing the sacrificial post, the ahavaniya fire etc., even though they are supramundane, are intimated by the sacred teaching only as subsidiary to an injunction. Whence is this? Because the sacred teaching has for purport the fruit of engaging in an activity or desisting therefrom.

As is said But that, which is accepted, i.e., implied for the establishment of that other, which is enjoined, that too is enjoined this is the usage of the tantra the Pareamtmāņsā sūstra. And for knowledge, the content of the injunc tion, injunctiveness consists in the practice of it, in the sense of contemplation for the self, however, as the content of that contemplation, injunctiveness consists in the certitude of its own existence.

Hence the sacred teaching is purposeful as prompting a man to a particular object and respect of the stake enjoined for the tying up in he is to tie up the beast to the stake, since it is out of the ordinary, there is the question what is this stake in substance and shape? from the texts khadira ebony becomes the stake, he fashions the stake, he is to make the stake octagonal etc., though having for purport the injunction of acts of carpentry, it is understood that a particular kind of wood purified and fashioned in a particular shape is the stake.

Now, here the distinctness of what is desired to be known has been stated

Of these, the fruit of the know ledge of Brahman should be distinct from the fruit of the knowledge of Religious Duty, which requires an observance. It cannot possibly be thus because Brahman is taught only as occasioned by an injunction about some thing to be done.

In the unseen potentiality, there is, for the impressions of the contemplation of the meaning of the Vedanta, the capacity to produce the intuition of the jiva being of the nature of Brahman, even without the need of an unseen potentiality.

Of these, some may be eternal in evolution, in which though subject to transformation, the cognition This is but that is not destroyed for example, earth etc., for those who uphold the universe to be eternal, or, for example, the constituents gunas, for the Sankhyas. This, however, is absolute, immu tably eternal, allpervasive like the ether, devoid of all modifications, eternally contented, without parts, selfluminous by nature, which merit and demerit together with their fruit do not approach, nor the three times. This is the nonembodiment called final release, because of Scriptures like, Other than Others, indeed, mention two kinds of eternalitythe immutable eternality and the evolving eternality.

If it evolve as a whole, how can there be no destruction of its nature? If it evolve in part, is that part different from it or non different? If it be different, how can the transformation be of that eternal entity? Indeed, when one thing is transformed, a different thing is not also transformed, as that would be an undue extension.

Therefore such is Brahman, the desire to know which is here the context. If that be taught as subsidiary to something to be done, and if final release be acknowledged to be something to be accomplished by that which is to be done, then it would be certainly noneternal.

And if it does not recur, how is the bracelet non different from gold? For, those, which are variable when something is recurrent, are certainly different from that, as the different flowers from the string. And though goldness is recurrent, earring etc. are not recurrent hence, they too are certainly different from gold.

Therefore, that which on the apprehension of another is not itseif apprehended is different from that other for example, when the camel is apprehended, the ass, which is not apprehended, differs from the camel. And when gold is apprehend ed from a distance, a distance, its particularities, earring etc., are not apprehended therefore they are different from gold.

kutaḥ ? kriyāśrayatvānupapatteḥ | nāvidyābrahmāśrayā, kiṃ tu jīve; sā tvanirvacanīyetyuktam;tena nityaśuddhameva brahma |	Why not? Because of the unintelligibility of the self being the locus of an act. Nescience is located not in Brahman, but in the jiva but that has been said to be indeterminable hence, Brahman is certainly eternally pure.
abhyupetya tvaśuddhiṃ kriyā-saṃskāryatvaṃ dūṣyate |	Admitting impurity, however, he condemns the view of its being purified by an act.
kriyā hi brahmasamavetā vā brahmasaṃskuryāt, yathā nigharṣaṇamiṣṭakācūrṇasaṃyoga vibhāga-pracayo nirantara ādarśatalasamavetaḥ;	Indeed, an act may purify Brahman either as inherent in Brahman, just as the rubbing consisting in the extensive conjunction and disjunction of brick powder is always inherent in the surface of the mirror or, as inherent in another.
na tāvadbrahmadharmaḥ kriyā, tasyāḥ svāśraya-vikārahetutvena brahmaṇo nityatvavyāghātāt |	The act is not an attribute of Brahman, since, that act being the cause of modification in its locus, there would be destruction of Brahmans eternality.

na; dehādisaṃhatasyaivāvidyā-gṛhītasyātmanaḥ saṃskriyamāṇatvāt |	No because what is purified is only that self which is associated with the body etc., which is caught hold of by Nescience.
pratyakṣaṃhi snānācamanāderdehasamavāyitvam |	Indeed, it is a matter of perception that bathing, sipping etc. inhere in the body.

When the mirror is rubbed, the gem is not, indeed, seen to be purified.

śukraṃ dīptimat; atraṇaṃduḥkharahitam ; astrāviraṃ avigalitam, avinā-śīti yāvat |	The one god etc. Sukram means effulgent avranam means free from misery asnāviram means undissolved, that is to say, indestructible.
upasaṃharati — tasmāt iti |ato'nyanmokṣaṃ prati kriyānupraveśadvāraṃna śakyaṃ kenaciddarśayitum |	He concludes Therefore etc. Other than these, no one can point out any channel through which an act may enter into final release.

Is there, then, in release no action at all? In that case, all sacred teaching for that purpose and all engaging in activity for that purpose would be futile. To this he says by way of conclusion Therefore, apart from the one means, knowledge etc. on the mental activity of a person.

Knowledge, however, is Now, how can it be that knowledge, which is a mental act, is not the sphere of an injunction ? And how can it be that its fruit, release, is not one of those achieved etc.? Thus he asks Now, what is called knowledge etc. He answers
kutaḥ ? vailakṣaṇyāt |	No. Why not? Because of differ ence. This is the sense
ayamarthaḥ – satyam,jñānaṃ mānasī kriyā: na tviyaṃ brahmaṇi phalaṃjanayitumarhati tasya svayaṃprakāśatayā vidikriyā-karmabhāvānupapatterityuttam |	true, knowledge is a mental act but this cannot generate fruit in the nature of Brahman, since, being selfluminous, that Brahman cannot intelligibly be in the relation of an object to an act of cognition this has been said before.

ato jñānaṃ kartumakartu-manyathā vā kartuṃ na śakyam; kevalaṃ vastu-tantrameva tat; na codanātantram, nāpipuruṣatantram |	Therefore, knowledge cannot be effected or not effected or effected in a different way it is dependent purely on the thing it is not dependent on an injunction, nor is it dependent on a person.

Thus he asks For what purpose, then etc. Nor is it meet that they should be futile, as their purport being apprehended in consequence of the injunction to study ones own Veda would, then, be unintelligible this is the idea.

Again, as for the statement that the knowledge of the self, not relating primarily to what is to be done, serves neither for acceptance nor rejection, this is acknowledged to be even so.

As for what was objected that the knowledge of the self, not being subsidiary to an observance, is not a human goal, that does not stand to reason its being a human a goal being established in its own right, its not being subsidiary to an injunction is a merit, not a defect thus he says

If the capacity of words in respect of the expres sion of what is to be done or the expression of their own subsidiary to that which is to be done were settled as a rule in the usage of elderly persons, then, the Upanişads would not have for purport Brahman as the self, which is not what is to be rejected or accepted for such capacity is not known of words in experience, and the cognition of Vaidic sense is preceded by that ie,, the cogni tion of their sense in experience.

First, then, there would be no apprehension of a relationship in respect of a sense which is not to be done, only if there were not seen in experience any usage with that purport, and if it were not possible to infer the cogni tion of that in the case of him who knows the meaning of words.

Thereby is this established

The word Upanişad is derived from sat, with una and ni as prefixes meaning destruction and a kvip suffix it declares the knowledge of Brahman, since, taking the nondual Brahman near one, it destroys Nescience together with its impressions because of being the cause thereof, the Vedantas too are Upanişads he who is known therefrom is the person propounded in the Upanişads.

To this he says

To this he says

Though for the self there is not, as for cow etc., being the sphere of other means of knowledge, yet, being, as it is, the luminous self, it is possible to indicate it as the significance of the sentence, through the destruction of the respective adjuncts, in the same way as gold through the destruction of bracelets, earrings.

Now, like the refutation of the adjunct, why is there not also refuted the existence of the self that gets conditioned? Now, since the self is the content of the concept I, it is unintelligible that he can be understood from the Upanişads alone.
na, tatsākṣitvenapratyuktatvāt |	No, because, as the witness thereof, this has been refuted.

ataḥ sataddhiṣṭhānatvācca prapañcavibhramasya |	To this he says and because it is not possible to deny the self. Luminosity is, indeed, the self of all, since the worlddelusion has that for its substrate.

Further, by the light of the selfs luminosity is there light for the world. And thus says Scripture That shining, all else shines after it by its light all this shines. Nor when the luminosity of the self is denied, is the manifestation of the world appropriate.

The words which are used in experience, the same are used in the Veda too, and the meanings are the same in both cases hence, the word self in the Upanişads too should apply in that sense alone, not in any other sense opposed to it this is the sense. He answers

kutaḥ ?ātmatvādeva | na hyātmā anyārthaḥ, anyattusarvamātmārtham |	Why not? Even because of being the self. The self, indeed, is not for the sake of another, but all others are for the sake of the self.

Further, for that very reason of being the self of all, it is not what is to be rejected or accepted.
sarvasya hi prapañcajātasya brahmaiva tattvamātmā; na ca svabhāvo heyaḥ,aśakyahānatvāt ;	Indeed, of the entire universe, Brahman alone is the true self nor is ones nature what is to be rejected, since it cannot be rejected nor is it what is to be accepted, being already attained.

This is the sense the self, indeed, is absolutely real, being established by Scripture, traditional Code, epies, purāṇas and reasoning not opposed to these the world, however, which is exhibited by beginningless Nescience, is not absolutely real.
yaśca paramārthasanaasau prakṛtiḥ rajjutattvamitra sarpavibhramasya vikārasya |ata evāsyānirvācyatvenādṛḍhasvabhāvasya vināśaḥ |puruṣastu paramārthasana;	And that which is absolutely real is the material cause of this, as the real rope is of the modification, viz., the delusion of the snake. Hence it is that there is the perishing of this, which, as indeterminable, is of un stable nature.
nāsau kāraṇasahasreṇāpyasanaśakyaḥ kartum |	The self, however, is absolutely real nor can this be made unreal even by a thousand causes.

tasmādavināśipuruṣāntovikāravināśaḥ śuktirajjutattvānta iva rajatabhujaṅga-vināśaḥ |	Therefore, there is the perishing of all modifications stopping the imperishable self, just as there is the perishing of the silver and the snake stopping at the real nacre and rope.
puruṣa eva hi sarvasya prapañcavikārajātasyatattvam |	The self, indeed, is the sole truth of the entire host of modifications in the universe.

It has been said that not one Hi That quotation too from those who know the purport of the sacred teaching, Its purport is indeed seen to be the teaching of rituals and so on, that has to be understood to refer to sacred teachings of prescriptions and prohibitions, since the content is the desire to know Religious Duty.

Indeed the existent that is taught does not turn out to be an act. If it be said that of the three kinds of modificationconsisting of dharma, laksana, and avasthaexists here. Further, since of the absolutely real self the attribute too is absolutely real, the alteration of that, as in the case of the self, cannot be effected by any cause. Nor is there any modification other than the alteration of the attribute.

Where it ought to be said Its purport is, indeed, seen to be the fruitful teaching of the sense, since since, though not an act, the existent is instrumental to an act, the teaching about an existent is only.

This is what is said thereby an injunctive statement, while making known the thing that is to be done, makes known for the sake of that even objects already existent etc. To this he says If, besides the engaging in and desist ing from activity, it teaches existent things etc. This is what is intended it has been taught by those who have shown the meaning of words even with reference to existent things that the apprehension of relation of word to sense is not in respect of that sense alone of its own which subserves what is to be done, and not in any other sense.
nāpi svārthamātraparataiva padānām |tathā sati na vākyārthapratyayaḥ syāt |	Nor is the purport of words only in respect of their own sense unrelated to that of other words. If that were so, there would be no cognition of the sense of a sentence.
na hipratyekaṃ svapradhānatayā guṇapradhānabhāvarahitānāmeka-vākyatā dṛṣṭā |	For, syntactical unity is not seen among those which are each independently primary and are devoid of the relation of primary and secondary among themselves.
tasmātpadānāṃ svārthamabhidadhatāmeka-prayojanavatpadārthaparatayaikavākyatā |	Hence, there is syntactical unity for words, which express their own sense, through their having for purport a common fruitful wordsignificance.

As is said by those who know the sacred teaching Though the letters directly effect the teaching of the wordsignifi cance, yet they do not terminate there fruitlessly in their activity towards valid knowledge of the sentencesignifi cance, the teaching of the wordsignificance is an inevitable intermediary, like the flame of the fuel in cooking. And thus, the cognition of the sentencesignificance being intelligible even with words having for purport the con junction with other significances, there is no rule as to their having for purport the conjunction with what is to be done. And this being the case, there is no defect even in having for purport the nature of the immutably eternal Brahman.

na hyupahitaṃ śataśo dṛṣṭamapyanu-pahitaṃ kvacidṛṣṭamadṛṣṭaṃ bhavati |	Verily, though the conditioned be seen a hundred times, the unconditioned seen somewhere does not become unseen as it were.

Similarly, there are those which are related to the significance of the stem alone for example, to the question Of what kind are these trees? the reply is Fruitbearing Indeed.

He questions If it the existent be said to be taught, what good will that be to you whether teacher or listener? Therefore, only that existent which is fruitful should be taught, not that which is fruitless and Brahman is fruitless, since to that which is indifferent, as devoid of all activity, no serviceability can belong this is the idea.

Further, even by those who recognise in the case of all words that their purport is what is to be done, it is not possible to recognise in the case of statements like A brahmin is not to be killed, Liquor is not to be drunk etc., that they have for purport what is to be done.

For, the content of volition is that which is directly pervaded by volition and of substance and quality, which are existent, there is no pervasion by volition.

Though for words signifying substance and quality there is relation to what is to be done in the stage when they are occasioned, yet, since there is for becoming, of itself, the relation to what is to be done, while for words signifying substance and quality that is only through their conjunction with becoming, the understanding of the novel rite eto. is only through words signifying becoming, not through words signifying substance or quality.

And thus, when the process of becoming is prescribed, that itself is prescribed together with its complements hence, substance and quality, though not contents, get prescribed as complements thereto.

Hereby is refuted the view that in That agneya rite which is on eight potsherds etc., the prescription has for content the connection of the rite with its material and deity.

Indeed, even in Make a pot, human effort has not for its sphere the pot which is the direct signifi cance of the noun rather does it operate the staff etc. through the hand etc. Therefore, that sentence declares only that volition which has for content the operation and is for the sake of the pot, but not that which has directly the pot as content.

What is it that is said in That ugneya which is offered etc. ? What is said is One should bring about what is desired through the agneya sacrifice .

Hi Hence it is invariable that in every case the injunction has for content the operation alone, through the channel of volition.

And thus it would follow that the final obsequies have been performed for that function of negation which consists in the denial of that for which there is an occasion.

To this he says Nor is it possible to assume for the negative particle the signification of a non established act, as distinct from the indifference consisting in desisting from the act of killing. For what reason is because of the it not possible? To this he says connection of the negative particle with the sense of killing that is established through ones own nature.

And since nonexistence is determined by the existent that is opposed to itself, and takes on the colour of the existent, it appears as if existent in the case of the existent, and as if to be accomplished in the case of what is to be accomplished hence, the sense of the negative particle, whose content is what is to be accomplished, appears as if itself to be accomplished hence the delusion that the sense of the negative particle is something to be done.

And this understanding, which was nonexistent earlier and is generated immediately after the hearing of the word, has the hearing of the word for its cause hence in statements like He is to sacrifice, which prompt to activity, it is the word itself, which, making known the operation that is to be done and that is instrumental to what is desired, also makes known its instrumentality to what is desired and the obligation to do it for, these two are not otherwise obtained, and what is not otherwise obtained is the sense of the word.

niṣedhyānāṃ cānartha-sādhanatābuddhireva niṣedhyābhāvabuddhiḥ |	It is the cognition of the instrumentality to evil in the case of what are prohibited that is the cognition of the nonexistence of what are prohibited.

This being is intent on activity only so long as he does not understand its instrumentality to evil.

And it is not that there is loss of the warriors life, when the armour is removed. and there is no attack of missiles.

Raising this ques tion, he answers it by way of conclusion Therefore, the declaration of futility is to be understood etc. The prima facie and final views based on nonsubsidiariness and subsidiariness to what is to be done have for content narratives etc., which do not serve the human goal but they do not have the Upanişads for content, since the Upanişads lead up to the realisation of Brahman, which is of itself the human goal this is the sense.

Verily, because for the rich house holder, having the conceit of wealth, there is found fear caused by the possible theft of the wealth, there does not continue for the same man, when he renounces and becomes freed from the conceit of wealth, the same fear caused by the possible theft of the wealth.

Hence, it is established that there is but similarity to the declaration of the true nature of the rope as rope, not snake.

In this very matter, he mentions two examples, divided. into the nonorigination of happiness and of misery

tasmānnāvagata-brahmātmabhāvasya yathāpūrvaṃ saṃsāritvam ;yasya tu yathāpūrvaṃ saṃsāritvaṃ nāsāvavagata-brahmātmabhāva ityanavadyam |jīvato viduṣo'śarīratve ca śrutismṛtī udā-harati — tathā ca iti |	Therefore, not in the case of him who has realised Brahman as the self, is there transmigratoriness as before he, however, who has transmigratoriness as before, has not realised Brahman as the self this is faultless. And in the matter of nonembodiment during life for the wise one, he cites Scripture and traditional Code And thus etc. This is easily understood.

ya-di hyavagataṃ brahmānyatra viniyujyeta,bhavettadā vidhiśeṣatvam;	If the realised Brahman were employed elsewhere, then there would be subsidiariness.

Now, it has been said If the jivas realisation of Brahman as the self were alone the cause of the cessation of the attribute of transmigration, there would be, alas! the futility of the prescription of reflection etc. hence, the Vedantas have for purport the injunction of contempla tion restating this, he condemns it
manananididhyāsanayorapi na|vidhiḥ, tayoranvayavyatirekasiddhasākṣātkāraphalayorvi-ghisarūpairvacanairanuvādāt; tadidamuktam-avaga-tyarthatvāt iti |	Again, as for the statement etc. Even of reflection and contemplation there. is no prescription, since of these two which are established. by copresence and coabsence to have the fruit of intui tion, there is but restatement by sentences which have the appearance of injunctions that is thus said
brahmasākṣātkāro'vagatiḥ; tadarthatvaṃmanananididhyāsana yoranvayavyatirekasiddhamityarthaḥ |	because they are for the purpose of realisation. Intuition of Brahman is realisation the subsidiariness thereto of reflection and contemplation is established by copresence and coabsence this is the sense.
athakasmānmananādividhireva na bhavatītyata āha -yadi hyavagatam iti |	Why, then, should it not be an injunction alone in respect of reflection etc.? To this he says

evaṃ casati 'athāto brahmajijñāsā' ititadviṣayaḥ pṛthak śāstrārambha upapadyate |pradhānakarmaṇī apūrvaviṣaye amṛtatvaphale ityukta-madharatāt |	And this being the case, the com mencement of a distinct sacred teaching dealing with that, in the form Then therefore the desire to know Brahman, is intelligible.

na kevalaṃ siddharūpatvādbrahmātmaikyasya dharmā-danyatvam, api tu tadvirodhādapītyupasaṃhārakhyāje-nāha-tasmādahaṃ brahmāsmi iti |	There fore, I am Brahman in this alone terminate all of contemplation etc. Not merely because of being of the nature of an existent is the oneness of Brahman and the self other than Religious Duty, but also because of opposi tion thereto thus he says by way of conclusion
itikaraṇenajñānaṃ parāmṛśati |	in this alone etc. By the word this he refers to the knowledge.

And these, which are based on i.e., have as content differences of end, means, and modus operandi, and give rise to Religious Duty through teaching it, cannot, when there is oneness of Brahman and the self, be based on those differences, because of opposition this is the sense.

Further, they say When the secondary and the illusory selves are nonexistent, then, because of the sublation of son, body etc., how can the thing to be done, the enlightenment that I am of the nature of the real Brahman, come about? Prior to the cognition of the self that is to be sought, there is knowership for the self. What is to be sought is the knower alone, as free from sin, defect etc. As the cognition of the self in the body is assumed to be valid know ledge, even so is this empirically valid knowledge assumed to be valid up to the ascertainment of the self. means of valid knowledge in respect of Religious Duty, but of all means of valid knowledge thus he says and all other means of valid knowledge. Why? Not, indeed, when there is the realisation etc. In nonduality, indeed.

tadidamuktam-apramātṛkāṇi ca iti cakāreṇa |atraiva brahmavidāṃ gāthā udāharati apicāhuḥ iti |	That is thus stated by the and in and which are devoid of a knower. To this very effect he cites the verses of a Brahman knower
putradārādiṣvātmābhimāno gauṇaḥ |	Further, they say etc. The conceit of the self in son, wife etc., is secondary.
yathā|samanvayaḥsvaduḥkhena duḥkhī, yathā svasukhena sukhī, tathā putrādi-gatenāpīti so'yaṃ gauṇaḥ |	As one feels miserable by ones own misery, and happy by ones own happiness, so too does one feel by what is present in the son etc. hence it is secondary.
na tvekatvābhimānaḥ,bhedasyānubhavasiddhatvāt |	But there is not the conceit of oneness, since difference is established in experience.
tasmāt 'gaurvāhīkaḥitivadgauṇaḥ |	Hence, it is secon dary figurative as in The Vahika the inhabitant of a country of that name is an ox.
dehendriyādiṣu tyabhedānubhavānna gauṇaātmābhimānaḥ;	But the conceit of the self in the body, organs etc., is not secondary, because of the experience of nondifference from them it is an illusion, rather, like the cognition of silver in nacre.

If that, however, were nonexistent, there would be no march of the world, nor even the experi ence of the oneness of Brahman and the self, because of the nonexistence of the means thereto, viz., hearing, reflection etc. That is thus said
gauṇātmano-'sattve putrakalatrādibādhanam; mamakārābhāva itiyāvat |	because of the sublation of son, body etc. When the secondary self is nonexistent, there is sub lation of son, wife etc. that is to say, the nonexistence of the sense of mine.

Whence its impossi bility? To this he says Prior to the cognition of the self that is to be sought, there is knowership for the self. This knowership is a synecdoche the distinction of valid knowledge, object of valid knowledge and means of valid knowledge is also to be understood.
etaduktaṃ bhavati–eṣa hi vibhāgo'dvaita--,sākṣātkārakāraṇam, tato niyamena prāgbhāvāt ;tena tadabhāve kārya notpadyata iti |	This is what is said this distinction, indeed, is the cause of the intuition of nonduality, since it invariably precedes it therefore, when that is nonexistent, the effect is not produced.

Be this so.

To this he says As the cognition of the self in the body is assumed to be valid knowledge, even so is this empirically valid knowledge assumed to be valid. The terminus of this he states
asyāvadhimāha—ā ātma-niścayāt; ā brahmasvarūpasākṣātkārādityarthaḥ |etaduktaṃ bhavati – pāramārthikaprapañcavādibhirapi dehā-diṣvātmābhimāno mithyeti vaktavyam, pramāṇa-bādhitatvāt |	up to the ascertainment of the self up to the intuition of the nature of Brahman this is the sense. This is what is said even by those who maintain the absolute reality of the world, it must be said that the conceit of the self in the body etc. is illusory, since it is sublated by valid knowledge.
tasya ca samastapramāṇakāraṇatvaṃbhāvikalokayātrāvāhitvaṃ cābhyupeyam |	And of this it should be admitted that it is the cause of all valid knowledge, and that it sustains the real march of the world.

As for that intuition which is real, that is not something to be done, since it is of the nature of Brahman.
