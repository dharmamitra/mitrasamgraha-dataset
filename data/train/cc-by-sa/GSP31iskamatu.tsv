iha satāmapyarthānāmatidūrādanupalabdhirdṛṣṭā / yathā deśāntarasthānāṃ caitramaitraviṣṇumitrāṇām /	Here, even existent objects are not perceived on account of excessive distance, for example, of Caitra, Maitra, and Viṣṇumitra living in another country.
sāmīpyādyathā cakṣuṣo 'ñjanānupalabdhiḥ /	On account of excessive proximity e.g., an eye cannot perceive collyrium in itself.

abhibhavādyathā sūryatejasābhibhūtā grahanakṣatratārakādayo nopalabhyante /	On account of suppression e.g., the planets, asterisms, and stars are invisible on account of the suppression of their light by the sun.

Now, it is explained why there is no apprehension of Nature and the Spirit, and how can they be apprehended The nonapprehension of Nature is due to its minuteness and not to nonexistence. It is ascertained from its effects.
mahadādi tacca kāryaṃ prakṛtivirūpaṃ svarūpaṃ ca //	Those effects are Mahat and the rest, and they are similar and dissimilar to Nature.
saukṣmyāttadanupalabdhiḥ pradhānasyetyarthaḥ /	Its nonapprehension is due to minuteness. Nonapprehension of Nature.
pradhānaṃ saukṣmyānnopalabhyate yathākāśe dhūmoṣmajalanīhāraparamāṇavaḥ santo 'pi nopalabhyante /	Nature is not apprehended on account of minuteness. As even the existent atoms of smoke, heat, water and frost are invisible in the sky.
kathaṃ tarhi tadupalabdhiḥ / kāryatastadupalabdhiḥ /	Then, how is it to be ascertained? It is to be ascertained from its effects.
kāryaṇa dṛṣṭvā kāraṇamanumīyate /	A cause is inferred from the observation of an effect.
asti pradhānaṃ kāraṇaṃ yasyedaṃ kāryam / buddhirahaṃkārapañcatanmātrāṇi ekādaśendriyāṇi pañcamahābhūtāni eva tatkāryam /	Nature, as the cause, does exist, whose effects are these intellect, ego, the five subtle elements, the eleven organs and the five gross elements they are the effects of that Nature.

And similarand similar in form. Even in this world, a son is similar as well as dissimilar to his father.
yena hetunā tulyamatulyaṃ tadupariṣṭādvakṣyāmaḥ //	The causes of similarity and dissimilarity, we shall explain later on.
yadidaṃ mahadādikāryaṃ tatkiṃ pradhāne sadutādahosvidasadācāryavipratipatterayaṃ saṃśayaḥ / yato 'tra sāṃkhyadarśane satkāryaṃ bauddhādīnāmasatkāryam /	Are all these effects, viz., Mahat and the rest, existent or nonexistent in their cause, i.e. Nature?For in this school of Sāmkya philosophy, the effect is existent with the Buddhists and the rest, it is nonexistent.
yadi sadasanna bhavatyasatsanna bhavatīti vipratiṣedhastatrāha /	If it is existent, it cannot be nonexistent if, however, it is nonexistent, then it cannot be existent. This is a contradiction.
asadakaraṇādupādānagrahaṇātsarvasambhavābhāvāt / śaktasya śakyakaraṇātkāraṇabhāvācca satkāryam //	Therefore, it is said The effect is existent in its cause, since, nonexistent cannot be produced, since the material cause is selected, since everything cannot be produced from anything, since a potent cause produces that of which it is capable and since effect is of the same nature as the cause.
asadakaraṇānna sadasato 'karaṇaṃ tasmātsatkāryaṃ ihaloke 'satkaraṇaṃ nāsti yathā sikatābhyastailotpattistasmātsataḥ karaṇādasti prāgutpapteḥ /	Since there can be no production of nonexistent thing, so an effect does exist in its cause. In this world we do not see the production of a nonexistent object, as oil cannot be produced from sand wherein oil is nonexistent.
pradhāne vyaktamataḥ satkāryam /	So, since only an existent object can be produced, the Manifest does exist before its production in Nature.
kiṃ cānyadupādānagrahaṇādupādānaṃ kāraṇaṃ tasya grahaṇādihaloke yo yenārthī sa tadupādānagrahaṇaṃ karoti dadhyarthī kṣīrasya na tu jalasya tasmāt satkāryam /	Morever, since the material cause is selected Upādāna is the material cause on account of selecting it. In this world, a man selects the material cause of that thing which he wants. One who wants curds selects milk and not water.
itaśca sarvasambhavābhāvāt sarvasya sarvatrasambhavo nāsti yathā suvarṇasya rajatādau tṛṇapāṃśusikatāsu tasmāt sarvasambhavābhāvāt satkāryam /	Therefore, the effect exists. Again, since everything cannot be produced. Everything cannot be produced from anywhere. For example, gold cannot be produced from silver, grass, dust and sand. So the effect is existent, because everything cannot be produced from anywhere.
itaśaca śaktasya śakyakaraṇāt /	And again, since a potent thing can produce that of which it is capable.
iha kulālaḥ śakto mṛddaṇḍacakracīvararajjunīrādikaraṇopakaraṇaṃ vā śakyameva ghaṭāṃ mṛtpiṇḍādutpādayati tasmāt satkāryam /	Here we see that only a potent thing, like the potter or the means like earth, wheel, a thread of rags, water etc., can produce, from the earth a pot, which is capable of being produced.
itaśca kāraṇabhāvācca satkāryam /	Therefore, the effect is existent.
kāraṇaṃ yallakṣaṇaṃ tallakṣaṇameva kāryameva yathā yavebhyo 'pi yavāḥ vrīhībhyo vrīhayaḥ yadāsatkāryaṃ syāttataḥ kodravebhyaḥ śālayaḥ syurna ca santīti tasmāt satkāryam /	And also, since the effect is of the same nature as that cause. The effect is of the same nature of which the cause is e.g., barley is produced from barley and rice from rice. If the effect were not existent, then rice could be produced from kodravas and as it is not so, therefore, the effect is existent.
evaṃ pañcabhirhetubhiḥ pradhāne mahadādiliṅgamasti tasmātsata utpattirnāsata iti //	Thus, there are five causes proving the existence of the mergent, viz., Mahat and the rest, in Nature.
prakṛtivirūpaṃ sarūpaṃ ca yaduktaṃ kathamityucyate / hetumadanityamavyāpi sakriyamanekamāśritaṃ liṅgam /	Now he explains the similarity and dissimilarity of Mahat and the rest with Nature The Manifest is caused, noneternal, nonpervading, active, manifold, dependent, mergent, conjunct and subordinate.
sāvayavaṃ paratantraṃ vyaktaṃ viparītamavyaktam //	The Unmanifest is just the reverse.
vyaktaṃ mahadādikāryyaṃ hetumaditi heturasyāsti hetumat /	The Manifest, viz., the effect like Mahat and the rest, is caused. Hetumat is that which has got a cause.
upādānaṃ hetuḥ kāraṇaṃ nimittamiti paryāyāḥ /	Upādāna, Heta, Kāraṇa and Nimitta are synonyms.

The principle of intellect is caused by Nature the principle of ego is caused by intellect the five subtle elements and the eleven organs are caused by the ego sky is caused by the subtle element of sound wind is caused by the subtle element of touch glow is caused by the subtle element of colour water is caused by the subtle element of taste earth is caused by the subtle element of smell.
evaṃ bhūtaparyyantaṃ vyaktaṃ hetumat /	Thus, the entire Manifest up to the five gross elements is caused.
kiṃ cānyadanityaṃ yasmādanyasmādutpadyate yathā mṛtpiṇḍādutpadyate ghaṭaḥ sa cānityaḥ /	Again, it is noneternal because it is produced from another. For example, a jar is noneternal, because it is produced from a lump of clay.
kiṃ cāvyāpyasarvvagamityarthaḥ yathā pradhānapuruṣau sarvvagatau naiva vyaktam /	Again, it is nonpervading that is, it is not allpervading. The Manifest is not allpervading as the Nature and the Spirit are.
kiṃcānyat sakriyaṃ saṃsārakāle saṃsarati trayodaśavidhena karaṇena saṃyuktaṃ sūkṣmaṃ śarīramāśritya saṃsarati tasmāt sakriyam /	Again, it is active it migrates at the time of creation. Because, it migrates along with the subtle body endowed with thirteen instruments, it is active.
kiṃcānyadanekaṃ buddhirahaṃkāraḥ pañcatanmātrānyekādaśendriyāṇi ca pañcamahābhūtāni pañcatanmātrāśritāni /	Again, it is manifold viz., intellect, ego, the five subtle elements, the eleven organs and the five gross elements. Again, it is dependent, i.e., dependent on its cause intellect depends upon Nature, ego depends upon intellect, the eleven organs and the five subtle elements depend upon ego and the five gross elements depend upon the five subtle elements.
kiṃca liṅgaṃ layayuktaṃ layakāle pañcamahābhūtāni tanmātreṣu līyante tānyekādaśendriyaiḥ sahāhaṃkāre sa ca buddhau sā ca pradhāne layaṃ yātīti /	It is endowed with the characteristic of merging. At the period of dissolution the five gross elements merge in five subtle elements the latter along with the eleven organs merge in ego ego merges in the intellect and the intellect merges in the Nature.
tathā sāvayavaṃ avayavāḥ śabdasparśarasarūpagandhāḥ taiḥ saha /	Again, it is conjunct i.e. made up of parts sound, touch, taste, colour and smell are the parts endowed with them.
kiṃca paratantraṃ nātmanaḥ prabhavati yathā pradhānatantrā buddhiḥ buddhitantro 'haṃkāraḥ ahaṃkāratantrāṇi tanmātrāṇīndriyāṇi ca tanmātratantrāṇi pañcamahābhūtāni ca /	Again, it is subordinate, i.e., it is not independent. As intellect is subordinate to Nature ego is subordinate to intellect the five subtle elements and the eleven organs are subordinate to ego and the five gross elements are subordinate to the five subtle elements.
evaṃ paratantraṃ parāyattaṃ vyākhyātaṃ vyaktam /	Thus, the Manifest which is subordinate, dependent on another, is explained.
atho 'vyaktaṃ vyākhyāmaḥ /	Now, we shall describe the Unmanifest.
viparītamavyaktam / etaireva guṇairyathoktairviparītamavyaktaṃ hetumadvyaktamuktam /	The Unmanifest is the reverse, i.e., just the reverse of these characteristics belong to the Unmanifest. The Manifest has been described as caused.
nahi pradhānāt paraṃ kiñcidasti yataḥ pradhānasyānutpattiḥ tasmādahetumadavyaktam /	There is nothing higher than Nature. And as the Nature is not produced, so the unmanifest is uncaused.
tathānityaṃ ca vyaktaṃ nityamavyaktamanutpādyatvāt nahi bhūtāni kutaścidutpadyanteti pradhānam /	Similarly, the Manifest is noneternal the Unmanifest is eternal, because not produced. It is not produced from anything like the gross elements. So, it is eternal.
kiṃ cāvyāpi vyaktaṃ vyāpi pradhānaṃ kāryyaṃ syāt /	There is nothing higher than the Nature of which the Nature could be an effect.
tathā vyaktaṃ liṅgamaliṅgamavyaktaṃ nityatvānmahadādi liṅgaṃ pralayakāle parasparaṃ pralīyate naivaṃ pradhānaṃ tasmādaliṅgaṃ pradhānam /	Again, the Manifest is mergent the Unmanifest is nonmergent, because it is eternal. The mergent, Mahat, etc., merge in one another at the time of dissolution. But the Nature is not such. Therefore, the Nature is nonmergent.
tathā sāvayavaṃ vyaktaṃ niravayavamavyaktaṃ nahi śabdasparśarasarūpagandhāḥ pradhāne santi /	Again, the Manifest is conjunct the Unmanifest is without parts. Sound, touch, taste, colour and smell do not exist in the Nature.
tathā paratantraṃ vyaktaṃ svatantramavyaktaṃ prabhavatyātmanaḥ //	Again. the Manifest is subordinate the Unmanifest is independent, is its own master.
evaṃ vyaktāvyaktayorvaidharmmyamuktaṃ sādharmmyamucyate yaduktaṃ sarūpaṃ ca /	Thus, the dissimilarity between the Manifest and the Unmanifest has been described now, the similarity between the two is explained, as it was said that it i.e. the product of the Nature is also similar to the Nature.
triguṇamaviveki viṣayaḥ sāmānyamacetanaṃ prasavadharmi /	The Manifest is composed of the three Attributes, nondiscriminated, objective, general, nonintelligent and productive.
vyaktaṃ tathā pradhānaṃ tadviparītastathā ca pumān //	So also is the Nature. The Spirit is the reverse of that, as well as similar.
triguṇaṃ vyaktaṃ sattvarajastamāṃsi trayo guṇā yasyeti /	The Manifest is composed of the three Attributes. It has the three Attributes, viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.
aviveki vyaktaṃ na viveko 'syāstīti /	The Manifest is nondiscriminated that is, it is devoid of discrimination.
idaṃ vyaktamime guṇā iti na vivekakarttuṃ yāti ayaṃ gaurayamaśva iti yathā ye guṇāstadvyaktaṃ yadvyaktaṃ te ca guṇā iti /	It is not possible to discriminate between the two that this is the Manifest and these are the Attributes, as we can do in the case of a bull and a horse that this is a bull and this is a horse.
tathā viṣayo vyaktaṃ bhojyamityarthaḥ sarvapuruṣāṇāṃ viṣayabhūtatvāt /	Again, the Manifest is objective that is, it is an object of enjoyment because, it is an object of enjoyment for all the Spirits.
tathā sāmānyaṃ vyaktaṃ mūlyadāsīvat sarvasādhāraṇatvāt /	Again, the Manifest is general because, it is common to all the Spirits like a harlot.
acetanaṃ vyaktaṃ sukhaduḥkhamohānna cetayatītyarthaḥ /	The Manifest is nonintelligent that is, it is not conscious of pleasure, pain and delusion.
tathā prasavadharmi vyaktaṃ tadyathā buddherahaṃkāraḥ prasūyate tasmāt pañcatanmātrāṇi ekādaśendriyāṇi ca prasūyante tanmātrebhyaḥ pañcamahābhūtāni /	Again, the Manifest is productive. For example, from intellect, ego is produced from ego, the five subtle elements and the eleven organs are produced from the five subtle elements, the five gross elements are produced.
evamete vyaktadharmāḥ prasavadharmāntā uktā evamebhiravyaktaṃ sarūpaṃ yathā vyaktaṃ tathā pradhānamiti /	Thus, these characteristics of the Manifest ending with productiveness have been described. The Unmanifest is similar in these characteristics.As the manifest is, so also is the Nature.
tatra triguṇaṃ vyaktamavyaktamapi triguṇaṃ yasyaitanmahadādi kāryaṃ triguṇam /	The Manifest is composed of the three Attributes the Unmanifest, whose products, viz., Mahat and the rest, are composed of the three Attributes, is also composed of the three Attributes.
iha yadātmakaṃ kāraṇaṃ tadātmakaṃ kāryamiti yathā kṛṣṇatantukṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa eva paṭo bhavati /	In this world, the effect has the same essence as the cause has e.g., a piece of cloth woven out of black yarn will be black.
tathāviveki vyaktaṃ pradhānamapi guṇairna bhidyate anye guṇā anyat pradhānameva vivaktuṃ na yāti tadaviveki pradhānam /	Again, the Manifest is nondiscriminated the Nature also cannot be discriminated from the three Attributes, It is not possible to discriminate that the Nature is other than the three Attributes so the Nature is nondiscriminated.
tathā viṣayo vyaktaṃ pradhānamapi sarvapuruṣaviṣayabhūtatvādviṣaya iti /	Again the Manifest is objective the Nature also is objective, because it is an object of enjoyment for all the Spirits.
tathā sāmānyaṃ vyaktaṃ pradhānamapi sarvasādhāraṇatvāt /	Again, the Manifest is general so also is the Nature, being common to all.
tathācetanaṃ vyaktaṃ pradhānamapi sukhaduḥkhamohānna cetayatīti kathamanumīyata iha hyacetanānmṛtpiṇḍādacetano ghaṭā utpadyate /	Again, the Manifest is nonintelligent the Nature also is not conscious of pleasure, pain and delusion. How do you infer this?We see that from a nonintelligent lump of clay, a nonintelligent jar is produced.
evaṃ pradhānamapi vyākhyātam /	Thus the Nature also has been described.
idānīṃ tadviparītastathā pumānityetadvyākhyāyate / sadviparītastābhyāṃ vyaktāvyaktābhyāṃ viparītaḥ pumān /	Now, we are going to explain“the Spirit is the reverse oof that as well as similar.” The reverse of that, i.e., the Spirit is the reverse o f the Manifest and the Unmanifest.
tadyathā triguṇaṃ vyaktamavyaktaṃ cāguṇaḥ puruṣaḥ /	For example The Manifest and the Unmanifest are compose of the three Attributes the Spirit is Attributeless.
aviveki vyaktamavyaktaṃ ca vivekī puruṣaḥ / tathā viṣayo vyaktamavyaktaṃ cāviṣayaḥ puruṣaḥ /	The Manifest and the Unmanifest are nondiscriminated the Spirit is discriminating. The Manifest and the Unmanifest are objective the Spirit is nonobjective.
tathā sāmānyaṃ vyaktamavyaktaṃ cāsāmānyaḥ puruṣaḥ /	The Manifest and the Unmanifest are general the Spirit is nongeneral i.e., individual.
acetanaṃ vyaktamavyaktaṃ ca cetanaḥ puruṣaḥ sukhaduḥkhamohāṃścetayati saṃjānīte tasmāccetanaḥ puruṣa iti /	The Manifest and the Unmanifest are nonintelligent, the Spirit is conscious of pleasure, pain and delusion it knows them therefore, it is intelligent.
prasavadharmi vyaktaṃ pradhānaṃ cāprasavadharmī puruṣo nahi kiñcit puruṣāt prasūyate /	The Manifest and the Nature are productive the Spirit is nonproductive. Nothing is produced from the Spirit.
tasmāduktaṃ tadviparītaḥ pumāniti /	Therefore, it is said that the Spirit is the reverse of that.
taduktaṃ tathā ca pumāniti / tat pūrvasyāmāryāyāṃ pradhānamahetumadyathā vyākhyātaṃ tathā ca pumān tadyathā hetumadananityamityādi vyaktaṃ tadviparītamavyaktaṃ tatra hetumadvyaktamahetumat pradhānaṃ tathā ca pumānahetumānanutpādyatvāt /	As to the remark that the Spirit is similar to that, it has been explained in the previous verse, viz., as the Nature is uncaused, so is the Spirit. It was said there that the Manifest is caused, noneternal and so on, the Unmanifest is the reverse of that. Here, the Manifest is caused the Unmanifest is uncaused so is the Spirit uncaused, because it is not produced.
anityaṃ vyaktaṃ nityaṃ pradhānaṃ tathā ca nityaḥ pumān /	The Manifest is noneternal the Unmanifest is eternal so also is the Spirit eternal.
akriyaḥ sarvagatatvādeva /	The Manifest is active the Unmanifest is inactive so also is the Spirit inactive, again because, it is omnipresent.
anekaṃ vyaktamekamavyaktaṃ tathā pumānyapyekaḥ /	The Manifest is manifold the Unmanifest is one so also is the Spirit one.
āśritaṃ vyaktamanāśritamavyaktaṃ tathā ca pumānanāśritaḥ / liṅgaṃ vyaktamaliṅgaṃ pradhānaṃ tathā ca pumānapyaliṅgaḥ / na kvacillīyata iti /	The Manifest is dependent the Unmanifest is independent so also is the Spirit independent. The Manifest is mergent the Unmanifest is nonmergent so also is the Spirit nonmergent, because it does not merge anywhere.
sāvayavaṃ vyaktaṃ niravayavamavyaktaṃ tathā ca pumān niravayavaḥ /	The Manifest is conjunct the Unmanifest is nonconjunct so also is the Spirit nonconjunct.
nahi puruṣe śabdādayo 'vayavāḥ santi /	There are no parts in the shape of sound and the rest in the Spirit.
kiṃca paratantraṃ vyaktaṃ svatantramavyaktaṃ tathā ca pumānapi svatantraḥ / ātmanaḥ prabhavatītyarthaḥ /	And again, the Manifest is subordinate the Unmanifest is nonSubordinate so also is the Spirit nonsubordinate, i.e., is its own master.
evametadavyaktapuruṣayoḥ sādharmyaṃ vyākhyātaṃ pūrvasyāmāryāyām /	Thus, the similarity of the Unmanifest with the Spirit was explained in the previous verse.
vyaktapradhānayoḥ sādharmyaṃ puruṣasya vaidharmyaṃ ca triguṇamavivekītyādi prakṛtyāryāyāṃ vyākhyātam // tatra yaduktaṃ triguṇamiti vyaktamavyaktaṃ ca tat ke te guṇā iti tat svarūpapratipādanāyedamāha /	It has been said that the Manifest and the Unmanifest are composed of three Attributes. Now, what are those three Attributes?The following is stated to explain their nature Kārilā XII The Attributes are of the nature of pleasure, pain and delusion they are adapted to illuminate, to activate and to restrain.
prītyaprītiviṣādātmakāḥ prakāśapravṛttiniyamārthāḥ / anyo 'nyābhibhavāśrayajananamithunavṛttayaśca guṇāḥ //	They mutually suppress, support, produce, consort and exist. The Attributes, viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are of the nature of pleasure, pain and delusion.
tatra prītyātmakaṃ sattvaṃ prītiḥ sukhaṃ tadātmakamiti /	The Sattva is of the nature of prīti prīti is p]easure it is of this nature.
aprītyātmakaṃ rajaḥ /	The Rajas is of the nature of aprīti aprīti is pain.
viṣādātmakaṃ tamaḥ / viṣādo mohaḥ /	The Tamas is of the nature of viṣāda viṣāda is delusion.
tathā prakāśapravṛtti niyamārthāḥ /	Again, they are adapted to illuminate, to activate and to restrain.
arthaḥ śabdaḥ sāmarthyavācī prakāśārthaṃ sattvaṃ prakāśasamarthamityarthaḥ /	The word artha stands for ‘competency’. Ptakāśārtham Sattvam means ‘competent to illuminate’.
pravṛttyarthaṃ rajo niyamārthaṃ tamaḥ sthitau samarthamityarthaḥ prakāśakriyāsthitiśīlā guṇā iti /	Rajas is adapted to activate. Tamas is adapted to restrain, i.e., is competent to fix a thing. That is, the Attributes are of the nature of illumination, activity and fixture.
tathānyonyābhibhavāśrayajananamithunavṛttayaśca /	Again,and they mutually suppress, support, produce, consort and exist.
anyonyābhibhavāḥ anyonyāśrayāḥ anyonyajananāḥ anyonyamithunāḥ anyonyavṛttayaśca te tathoktāḥ /	That is, they are mutually suppressive, mutually supporting, mutually productive, mutually consorting and mutually existing.
anyonyābhibhavā iti anyonyaṃ parasparamabhibhavantīti prītyaprītyādibhirdharmmairāvirbhavanti yathā yadā sattvamutkaṭaṃ bhavati tadā rajastamasī aprītipravṛttidharmmeṇa yadā tamastadā sattvarajasī viṣādasthityātmakena iti /	Mutually suppressive they mutually, i.e., one another, suppress, i.e., manifest themselves with the characteristics of pleasure, pain, etc. That means,when Sattva is predominant, then it is so by suppressing the Rajas and Tamas with its characteristics and it exhibits itself as pleasure and illumination.
tathānyonyāśrayāśca dvyaṇukavadguṇāḥ /	And the Attributes are mutually supporting like a binary.
anyonyajananāḥ yathā mṛtpiṇḍo ghaṭaṃ janayati /	They are mutually productive, as a lump of clay produces jar.
tathānyonyamithunāśca yathā strīpuṃsau anyonyamithunau tathā guṇāḥ /	And they are mutually consorting as husband and wife are mutually consorting, so are the Attributes.
uktaṃ ca / rajaso mithunaṃ sattvaṃ sattvasya mithunaṃ rajaḥ / ubhayoḥ sattvarajarormithunaṃ tama ucyate //	And it is said “The consort of Rajas is Sattva, the consort of Sattva is Rajas the consort of Sattva and Rajas, is said to be Tamas.” Devībhāgavata, III, .
parasparasahāyā ityarthaḥ /	That is, they are the helpmates of one another.
anyonyavṛttayaśca parasparaṃ varttante guṇāḥ guṇeṣu varttanta iti vacanāt /	And, they mutually exist, i.e., they coexist, according to the text, “The Attributes exist in the Attributes,” Bhagavadgītā, III, .
yathā surūpā suśīlā strī sarvvasukhahetuḥ sapatnīnāṃ saiva duḥkhahetuḥ saiva rāgiṇāṃ mohaṃ janayati eva satvaṃ rajastamasorvṛttiheturyathā rājā sadodyuktaḥ prajāpālane duṣṭanigrahe śiṣṭānāṃ sukhamutpādayati duṣṭānāṃ duḥkhaṃ mohaṃ ca evaṃ rajassattvatamasorvṛttiṃ janayati /	Just as a beautiful and virtuous woman is a source of pleasure to all but the same woman is a source of pain to her cowives and the same woman produces delusion in the passionate people similarly, Sattva is the source of the existence of Rajas and Tamas. Just as a king ever assiduous in protecting his subjects and punishing the wicked, produces pleasure in the good people and pain and delusion in the wicked, similarly, Rajas brings about the existence of Sattva and Tamas.
tathā tamaḥ svarūpeṇāvaraṇātmakena sattvarajasorvṛttiṃ janayati yathā meghāḥ khamāvṛtya jagataḥ sukhamutpādayanti te vṛṣṭyā karṣukāṇāṃ karṣaṇodyogaṃ janayanti virahiṇāṃ mohamevamanyonyavṛttayo guṇāḥ //	In the same way, Tamas brings about the existence of Sattva and Rajas by its own nature of covering things. For example, the clouds, covering the sky, produce pleasure in the world they urge the farmer to activity by their rain, and produce delusion in the separated lovers.
kiṃcānyat /	Thus, the Attributes are mutually existent.
sattvaṃ laghu prakāśakamiṣṭamupaṣṭambhakaṃ calaṃ ca rajaḥ /	Moreover Sattva is considered to be light and bright, Rajas exciting and mobile, and Tamas is only heavy and enveloping.

sattvaṃ laghu prakāśakaṃ ca yadā sattvamutkaṭaṃ bhavati tadā laghūnyaṅgāni buddhiprakāśaśca prasannatendriyāṇāṃ bhavati /	Sattva is light and bright. When Sattva predominates then the limbs become light, the intellect becomes bright and the organs become clear i.e. acute.

Upaṣṭambhaka is that which excites or stimulates. Just as a bull is very much excited at the sight of another bull, so is the nature of Rajas. And Rajas is observed to be mobile.
tathā rajaśca calaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ rajovṛttiścalacitto bhavati /	A man of the nature of Rajas is fickleminded.
guru varaṇamekameva tamaḥ yadā tama utkaṭaṃ bhavati tadā gurūṇyaṅgānyāvṛtānīndriyāṇi bhavanti svārthāsamarthāni /	Tamas is only heavy and enveloping. When Tamas predominates, then the limbs become heavy and the organs become enveloped i.e., dullincapable of apprehending their objects.

Pradīpavat means like a Lamp. Their function is considered to be aiming to achieve a common end. Just as a lamp composed of oil, fire and the wick, which are opposed to one another, illuminates objects, so Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, although opposed to one another, produce an effect.

avivekyādiḥ siddhastraiguṇyāttadviparyayābhāvāt /	This is answered The qualities of nondiscriminatedness and the rest of the characteristics of the Manifest are proved to exist in the Manifest by the possession of the three Attributes and by the absence of its i.e. of the Manifest reverse.
kāraṇaguṇātmakatvātkāryasyāvyaktamapi siddham //	The Unmanifest is also proved by the effect being of the same nature as its cause.

yathā yatraiva tantavastatraiva paṭaḥ / anye tantavo 'nyaḥ paṭo na kutastadviparyayābhāvāt /	For example, wherever there is yarn, there is cloth the yarn and the cloth are not different things Why? Because, there is absence of the reverse.
evaṃ vyaktāvyaktasampanno bhavati dūraṃ pradhānamāsannaṃ vyaktaṃ yo vyaktaṃ paśyati sa pradhānamapi paśyati tadviparyayābhāvāt /	Thus, there is a relationship sambandha established between the Manifest and the Unmanifest. Far away is the Unmanifest, but the Manifest is at hand. So, one who sees the Manifest, sees also the Unmanifest because, there is the absence of its, reverse.
itaścāvyaktaṃ siddhaṃ kāraṇaguṇātmakatvāt kāryasya /	Hence also the Unmanifest is provedBecause of an effect being of the same nature as its cause.

evaṃ mahadādiliṅgamavivekiviṣayaḥ sāmānyacetanaṃ prasavadharmi yadātmakaṃ liṅgaṃ tadātmakamavyaktamapi siddham //	Thus, the mergent Mahat and the rest are nondiscriminated, objective, general, nonintelligent and productive. So, whatever the essence of the mergent, the Unmanifest is also proved to possess the same essence.

Because, all what we do not apprehend in this world, does not exist.

In this world, wherever, we find an agent, we see a finiteness of his. For example, a potter makes only finite jars from finite lumps of clay so does Mahat also. The mergent Mahat and the rest are finite and are the specific effects of the Nature. Intellect is one, ego is one, the subtle elements are five, the organs are eleven and the gross elements are five.Thus, on account of the finiteness of the specific objects, there is Nature as the cause which produces the finite Manifest.

Again, because of natural sequence. This is quite well known in this world that when one sees a boy engaged in performing sacred rites, one infers that his parents are naturally brahmins. Similarly, seeing this mergent i.e. the evolved, we arrive at a thing which must be its cause.
tathā śaktitaḥ pravṛtteśca iha yo yasmin śaktaḥ sa tasminnevārthe pravarttate yathā kulālo ghaṭāsya karaṇe samartho ghaṭameva karoti na paṭaṃ rathaṃ vā /	Again, because of activity depending upon efficiency. Here a man does that for which he is efficient. For example, a potter who is efficient to produce a jar, produces only a jar and not cloth or chariot. Again.
tathāsti pradhānaṃ kāraṇaṃ kutaḥ kāraṇakāryavibhāgāt /	there is Nature as the cause. How?Because of distinction between cause and effect.
karotīti kāraṇam / kriyata iti kāryam /	Kāraṇa is that which produces kārya is that which is produced.
kāraṇasya kāryasya ca vibhāgo yathā ghaṭo dadhimadhūdakapayasāṃ dhāraṇe samartho na tathā taktāraṇaṃ mṛtpiṇḍaḥ /	There is a distinction of functions of cause and effect. For example, as a jar is competent to hold curds, honey, water and milk, so is not a lump of clay competent.
mṛtpiṇḍo vā ghaṭaṃ niṣpādayati na caivaṃ ghaṭo mṛtpiṇḍam /	Or, a lump of clay produces a jar, but a jar does not produce lump of clay.
evaṃ mahadādiliṅgaṃ dṛṣṭvānumīyate / asti vibhaktaṃ tat kāraṇaṃ yasya vibhāga idaṃ vyaktamiti /	Thus, seeing the mergent Mahat and the rest, it is inferred that there is a separate cause from which this Manifest has separated i.e., evolved itself.
itaśca avibhāgādvaiśvarūpasya viśvaṃ jagat tasya rūpaṃ vyaktiḥ /	And again, because of the merging of the diverse evoloved. Viśva means universe its rūpa is manifestation.

At the time of dissolution, the five gross elements, viz., earth, water, fire, air and ether, merge into the modified five subtle elements in the order of creation the five subtle elements and the eleven organs merge into ego ego merges into intellect intellect merges into Nature. Thus, the three worlds merge into Nature at the time of dissolution. From such merging of the Manifest and the Unmanifest, like that of milk and curds, there does exist the Unmanifest as the cause.
ataśca /	And for this reason The Unmanifest as the cause does exist.
kāraṇamastyavyaktaṃ pravartate triguṇataḥ samudayācca / pariṇāmataḥ salilavatpratipratiguṇāśrayaviśeṣāt //	It functions through the three Attributes by combining and by modification, like water, due to the particular characteristics of the abode of each of the Attributes.
avyaktaṃ prakhyātaṃ kāraṇamasti yasmānmahadādiliṅgaṃ pravarttate /	The wellknown Unmanifest as the cause does exist from which proceed the mergent Mahat and the rest.
triguṇataḥ triguṇāt sattvarajastamoguṇā yasmiṃstattriguṇaṃ tatkimuktaṃ bhavati sattvarajastamasāṃ sāmyāvasthā pradhānam /	Triguṇataḥ.i.e., from the Nature possessed of the three Attributes. Triguṇa is that which has the three Attributes, viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Then, what is the sense?It isthat the Nature is the equilibrium of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.
tathā samudayāt yathā gaṃgāśrotāṃsi triṇī rudramūrddhani patitāni ekaṃ sroto janayati evaṃ triguṇamavyaktamekaṃ vyaktaṃ janayati tathā vā tantavaḥ samuditāḥ paṭaṃ janayanti evamavyaktaṃ gunasamudayānmahadādi janayatīti triguṇataḥ samudayācca vyaktaṃ jagat pravarttate /	Again, by combining. As the three streams of the Ganges falling on the head of Rudra, combine to produce one stream, so the Unmanifest endowed with the three Attributes produces one Manifest. Or, as the combined threads produce cloth, so the Unmanifest creates Mahat and the rest, on account of the combination of the three Attributes. So, the manifested universe proceeds from the three Attributes and their combination.
yasmādekasmāt pradhānādvyaktaṃ tasmādekarūpeṇa bhavitavyam /	Well, as the entire Manifest proceeds from one Nature, so the former must be uniform.This objection does not arise.

The three worlds born of one Nature are not of uniform nature. Gods are happy, men are unhappy and the animals are deluded. The Manifest, proceeding from one Unmanifest, becomes like water on account of modification based on the particular characteristics abiding in each of the three Attributes.

For example, water falling from the sky is of uniform nature but coming into contact with different forms, that water becomes of different forms, due to different tastes. Similarly, the three worlds proceeding from one Nature, are not of uniform nature. Among the gods, the Sattva is predominant, and Rajas and Tamas are indifferent so they are very happy. Among men, the Rajas is predominant, and Sattva and Tamas are indifferent therefore, they are very unhappy, Among animals the Tamas is predominant, and Sattva and Rajas are indifferent so they are very insensible.
evamāryādvayena pradhānasyāstitvamabhyupagamyate /	Thus, by these two verses, the existence of the Nature is known.

So, after the knowledge of the Manifest, the Unmanifest has been known to exist by five reasons verse . Like the Unmanifest the Spirit also is subtle.
asti puruṣaḥ kasmāt saṃghātaparārthatvāt /	The Spirit exists. How?Since composite objects are meant for another.
yo 'yaṃ mahadādi saṃghātaḥ sa puruṣārtha ityanumīyate acetanatvāt paryaṅgavat /	It is inferred that the composition of Mahat and the rest is meant for the Spirit, because, it i.e., composition is unconscious like a bed.

The different parts, viz., gātrotpalaka, etc., of the bed cannot serve any mutual purpose.

So, this body, a composite of five gross elements, is meant for another. There exists the Spirit for whom this enjoyable body is born the body which is a composite of Mahat and the rest.
itaścātmāsti triguṇādiviparyayāt yaduktaṃ pūrvasyāmāryāyāṃ trigunamavivekiviṣaya ityādi / tasmādviparyayādyenoktaṃ tadviparītastathā pumān /	Hence also, the Spirit existssince it is the rerverse of that which has the three Attributes, viz., “possessed of the three Attributes, nondiscriminated, objective, etc.,” mentioned in the previous verse,the reverse of this.
adhiṣṭhānādyatheha laṃghanalpavanadhāvanasamarthairaśvairyukto rathaḥ sārathinādhiṣṭhitaḥ pravarttate tathātmādhiṣṭhānāccharīramiti /	As here, a chariot, united to horses capable of leaping, galloping and running, functions only when controlled by a charioteer, so does the body function on account of the control of the Spirit.
tathā coktaṃ ṣaṣṭhitantre puruṣādhiṣṭhitaṃ pradhānaṃ pravarttate / ato 'styātmābhoktṛtvāt /	As it is said in the Ṣaṣṭitantra“The Nature functions when controlled by the Spirit.” Hence, the Spirit exists.Since there must be someone who enjoys.

Kaivalya is the abstraction of kevala alone the activity for this purpose from this activity for its own release, it is inferred that the Spirit exists. For, everybody, learned or otherwise, desires for the cessation of the cycle of his births and deaths.
evamebhirhetubhirastyātmā śarīrādvyatiriktaḥ //	For these reasons there exists the Spirit apart from the body.

janma ca maraṇaṃ ca karaṇāni ca janmamaraṇakaraṇāni teṣāṃ pratiniyamāt pratyekaniyamādityarthaḥ /	Janmamaraṇakaraṇāni, means birth, death and the organs because of their pratiniyama, i.e., separate allotment of each.

But it does not happen so. Therefore, because birth, death and the organs are allotted separately, the plurality of the Spirits is established. Again, because there is no activity at one time.

Because we see that all people are not engaged in virtue and the rest at one and the same time. Some are engaged in virtue, others in vice, some in renunciation and some in knowledge. Therefore, by there being no activity at one time, ‘there are many Spirits’ is proved.
kiñcānyattraiguṇyāviparyayāccaiva triguṇabhāvaviparyayācca puruṣabahutvaṃ siddham /	And moreover, because there are different modifications of the three Attributes. Also, by the different modifications of the three Attributes, plurality of the Spirits is proved.

Therefore, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas being agents active, it follows that the Spirit is endowed with the characteristics of witnessing that Spirit which is the subject of plurality.
guṇā eva karttāraḥ pravarttante sākṣī na pravattate nāpi nivarttata eva /	Only the Attributes which are agents are active the witness neither acts nor desists from acting.
kiṃcānyat kaivalyaṃ kevalabhāvaḥ kaivalyamanyatvamityarthaḥ /	Moreover, the Spirit is endowed with isolation kaivalya is the property of being isolated or different.

Because the Spirit is indifferent, therefore, it is the perceiver and notagent of those actions. The Attributes, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas function as agents and action, and not the Spirit. Thus also the existence of the Spirit is proved.

As here, a jar becomes cold when it comes into contact with coolness, and becomes hot when it comes into contact with heat, so the linga, viz., Mahat and the rest, by coming into contact with that i.e., by coming into contact with the Spirit, becomes as if intelligent. Therefore, the volition is exercised by the Attributes and not by the Spirit.

How?ReplyAnd though the activity belong to the Attributes, yet the indifferent Spirit seems as if it were an agent. Though the activity resides in the Attributes, yet, even the indifferent Spirit becomes as if it were an agent not an actual agent.

puruṣasya darśanārthaṃ kaivalyārthaṃ tathā pradhānasya / paṅgvandhavadubhayorapi saṃyogastatkṛtaḥ sargaḥ //	The union of both i.e., the Spirit and the Nature is like that of a lame man with a blind man. The creation is brought about by that union.

Similarly, the Tāmasa ego, termed as Bhūtādi and being inactive, produces the five subtle elements, only when united to the active Taijasa ego. Therefore it is saidfrom Taijasa both. Thus, the Taijasa ego in the company of Sāttvika and Tāmasa ones produces the eleven organs and the five subtle elements.

The word Sparśana is used in that sense. Therefore, the text reads“Sparśanakāni”. They are called the five organs of sense, because they apprehend the five objects, viz., sound, touch, colour, taste and smell.
vākpāṇipādapāyūpasthān karmendriyāṇyāhuḥ karma kurvantīti karmendriyāṇi /	Speech hands, feet, anus and the organ of procreation are called the organs of action. The organs of action are so called because they perform action.

What is the nature, and of what essence is the mind?this is now explained Here, the mind is of the nature of both organs of sense and action. It is determinative, and is also an organ on account of similarity.
guṇapariṇāmaviśeṣānnānātvaṃ bāhyabhedācca //	This diversity of the organs and the diversities of external things, arise from the specific modifications of the Attributes.

Among the organs of sense, it is like an organ of sense among the organs of action, it is like an organ of action. Why?Because it determines the functioning of the organs of sense and action. Therefore, the mind is of the nature of both, Sankalpaka, because it determines.

That is, on account of possessing similar chnracteristics. The organs of sense, as well as of action, proceeding along with the mind from the Sāttvika ego, bring about the similarity of the mind. On account of that similarity the mind also is an organ. Thus, these eleven organs are produced from the Sāttvika or Vaikṛta ego.
tatra manasaḥ kā vṛttiriti /	Then, what is the function of the mind?
saṃkalpo vṛttiḥ /	Determination is the function of mind.

The functions of the organs of action are speech and the rest. Now, aee these different organs, apprehending different objects, created by God or are they selfgenerated?Because, the Nature, intellect and ego are nonintelligent, and the Spirit is also inactive.
iha sāṃkhyānāṃ svabhāvo nāma kaścitkāraṇamasti /	Herein, among the followers of the Sāmkhya doctrine, there is a certain spontaneity as the cause ?.

Thus, these different objects of the different organs, arise from the specific modification or the Attributes. Guṇapariṇāma is the modification of the Attributes.
athaitannānātvaṃ neśvareṇa nāhaṃkāreṇa na buddhyā na pradhānena na puruṣeṇa svabhāvāt kṛtaguṇapariṇāmeneti /	So, this diversity is not caused by God, ego, intellect, Nature or the Spirit, but is caused by the spontaneous modification of the Attributes.

The specifications also are caused by these Attributes. Hence, the eye is placed at a higher place in the body for observation, and so are nose, ear, tongue placed at their proper places in the body for apprehending their particular objects similarly, the organs of action are at their proper places for apprehending their particular objects,only these organs are a result of the spontaneous modification of the Attributes, and not the objects of these organs ?.

So, the external diversities are the result of only the Attributes, whose cause is Nature.

Intellect, ego and mind, when united to any one of the organs become four. Of these four, there is simultaneous functioning with regard to visible objects. Intellect, ego, mind and the eye simultaneously perceive the form, that it is a post intellect ego, mind and the tongue simultaneously apprehend taste intellect, ego, mind and the nose simultaneously apprehend the smell so do the skin and the ears.

Then he sees some mark or a bird over it. Then in his doubtful mind arises the determining intellect that it is a post. Thence comes the ego for making it a certainty that it is certainly a post. Thus, the gradual functioning of intellect, ego, mind and the eyes is observed.

The human organs of sense apprehend specific objects, viz., sound, touch, form, taste and smell, endowed with pleasure, pain and delusion. In the case of gods the organs of sense manifest nonspecific objects. Again, among the organs of action, the speech has sound for its object. The speech of gods as well as of human beings, utters verses and the rest.

Enjoyment means respective enjoyment. Since, the intellect along with the internal organs brings about or effects the enjoyment through the organs of sense and action of gods, human beings and animals, so it is again that very intellect which discriminates or distinguishes between the province of the Nature and that of the Spirit the difference between the Nature and the Spirit means diversity.

These specific objects are apprehended by men, and are tranquil, i.e., have the characteristic of pleasure, violent, i.e., have the characteristic of pain, and delusive, i.e., produce delusion. Just as the ethereal element is tranquil, i.e., gives pleasure to a man coming out of a closed room and the same becomes violent, i.e., gives pain to a man who is affected by cold, heat, wind and rain and the same becomes delusive, i.e., produces delusion in the mind of a man who loses his way in the forest similarly, wind is tranquil to a person oppressed by heat, violent to a person oppressed by a cold and delusive when mixed with sand and dust.

And those born of parents which aggregate i.e., compose the gross bodies they compose the gross body inside the womb by the mixture of the seminal fluids of parents, cohabiting after the menses. That subtle body is then nourished through the umbilical chord by the various saps of food and drink taken by the mother. The body thus commenced by the three specific objects, viz., the subtle elements, those born of parents and the gross elements, becomes furnished with back, stomach, thighs, chest, head and the rest, and is enveloped in six sheaths. It is endowed with blood, flesh, tendons, semen, bones and marrow, and is composed of five gross elements ether provides space for the body, wind provides growth, fire provides cooking, water provides aggregation and earth provides stability.

Thus, this subtle body migrates till discriminative wisdom is not attained. After achieving this wisdom a wise man leaves the body and attains salvation. Therefore, these subtle specific objects are permanent. Those born of parents are perishable The elements which are born of parents perish in this very world, leaving the subtle body at the time of death At the time of death, the body born of parents is left behind and its elements are dissolved into the earth and the rest.

Mahadādi means which is preceded by Mahat,i.e., intellect, ego, mind and the five subtle elements down to the subtle, i.e., subtle elements, it migrates or moves through the three worlds like an ant on the body of Śiva.

The word ādi comprises of other illustrations also, viz., just as there can be no coolness without water, or water without coolness fire without heat wind without touch ether without space earth without smell similarly, it is so. According to this illustration, without the nonspecific, i.e., without the nonspecific subtle elements, the linga does not subsist.

LingamThe subtle body composed of minute particles, i.e., the subtle elements, and endowed with thirteenfold organs, acts in the bodies of gods, men and beasts. How?Like an actor, just as an actor entering behind the scenes comes out as a god, then as a man, and afterwards as a buffoon, so the subtle body, through its connection with the means and their results, enters the womb and comes out as an elephant, a woman or a man.

What is the future? What is the highest good? By doing what can I attain my goal?While pondering like that he attains the knowledge that the Spirit is quite distinct from the Nature intellect is quite distinct ego is quite different the subtle elements, the organs and the five gross elements are quite different. Such knowledge of the principles arises, from which salvation is attained.
tathā śabdajñānāt pradhānapuruṣabuddhyahaṃkāratanmātrendriyapañcamahābhūtaviṣayaṃ jñānaṃ bhavati tato mokṣa ityeṣā śabdākhyā siddhiḥ /	From the knowledge obtained by oral instruction proceeds the knowledge about the Nature, Spirit, intellect, ego, the subtle elements, the organs and the five gross elements. Thence arises salvation.
adhyayanādvedādiśāstrādhyayanāt pañcaviṃśatitattvajñānaṃ prāpya mokṣaṃ yāti ityeṣā tṛtīyā siddhiḥ /	From Study, i.e., the study of the scriptures like the Vedas and the rest, one attains the knowledge of the twentyfive principles and afterwards salvation. This is the third Attainment.
duḥkhavighātatrayamādhyātmikādhibhautikādhidaivikaduḥkhatrayavighātāya guruṃ samupagamya tata upadeśānmokṣaṃ yātyeṣā caturthī siddhiḥ /	The threefold suppression of misery. In order to destroy the internal, external and divine miseries, when a person goes to a teacher, and after getting instruction from him gets salvation then this constitutes the fourth Attainment.
eṣaiva duḥkhatrayabhedāt tridhā kalpanīyā iti ṣaṭ siddhayaḥ /	This should he split up into three, on account of the threefoldness of misery. Thus, they make up six Attainments.
tathā suhṛtprāptiryathā kaścit suhṛt jñānamadhigamya mokṣaṃ gacchati eṣā saptamī siddhiḥ /	And intercourse of the friends e.g., a person attains salvation through the knowledge got from a friend. This is the seventh Attainment.

For example, a person helps the holy men by making gifts of dwelling, medicine, triple staff, bowl, food, clothes and the rest to them he gets knowledge from them and attains salvation. This is the eighth Attainment.
āsāmaṣṭānāṃ siddhīnāṃ śāstrāntare saṃjñāḥ kṛtāstāraṃ sutāraṃ tāratāraṃ pramodaṃ pramuditaṃ pramodamānaṃ ramyakaṃ sadāpramuditamiti /	In other treatises these eight Attainments are termed asTāra, Sutāra, Tāratāra, Pramoda, Pramudita, Pramodamāna, Ramyaka and Sadāpramudita.
āsāṃ viparyayāt budderbandhā ye viparītāsta aśaktau nikṣiptā yathātāramasutāramatāratāramityādidraṣṭavyamaśaktibhedā aṣṭāviṃśatiruktāste saha buddhibandhairekādaśendriyabandhā iti /	The injuries of intellect arising from the inversion of these Attainments are included under Incapacity. They are Atāra, Asutāra, Atāratāra and so on. The varieties of Incapacity have been mentioned to be twentyeight. They are the injuries of intellect along with the eleven injuries of organs.
tatra tuṣṭiviparyayā nava siddhīnāṃ viparyayā aṣṭau evamete saptadaśa buddhibandhā etaiḥ sahendriyabandhā aṣṭāviṃśatiraśaktibhedāḥ paścāt kathitā iti viparyayāśaktituṣṭisiddhīnāmevoddeśo nirdeśaśca kṛta iti /	The injuries of intellect are seventeen in number, viz., nine contraries of Contentment and eight contraries of Attainment. Along with these, the injuries of organs make up the twentyeight varieties of Incapacity mentioned before. Thus the varieties of Ignorance, Incapacity, Contentment and Attainment have been stated and explained.
kiṃ cānyat siddheḥ pūrvo 'ṅkuśastrividhaḥ siddheḥ pūrvā yā viparyayāśaktituṣṭayastā eva siddheraṃkuśastadbhedādevaṃ trividho yathā hastī gṛhītāṃkuśena vaśo bhavatyeva viparyayāśaktituṣṭibhirgṛhīto loko 'jñānamāpnoti tasmādetāḥ parityajya siddhiḥ sevyā sasiddhestattvajñānamutpadyate tanmokṣa iti //	Again, those mentioned before are the threefold curb on Attainment. Ignorance, Incapacity and Contentment, which are mentioned before Attainment in Kār. , are the curb and are threefold on account of their being of three sorts, just as an elephant is curbed by a man with a goad in his hand, so people curbed by Ignorance, Incapacity and Contentment suffer from ignorance. Therefore, leaving aside these, Attainment alone should be pursued. A person endowed with Attainment, acquires knowledge and thence salvation.
atha yaduktaṃ bhāvairadhivāsitaṃ liṃgaṃ tatra bhāvā dharmādayo 'ṣṭāvuktā buddhipariṇāmā viparyayāśaktituṣṭisiddhipariṇatāḥ sa bhāvākhyaḥ pratyayasargaḥ liṃgaṃ ca tanmātrasargaścaturdaśabhūtaparyanta uktastatraikenaiva sargeṇa puruṣārthasiddhau kimubhayavidhasargeṇetyata āha / na vinā bhāvairliṅgaṃ na vinā liṅgena bhāvanirvṛttiḥ /	It was stated “The subtle body is endowed with dispositions,” Kār. the eight dispositions, viz., Virtue and the rest, which are the modifications of intellect and which are again modified as Ignorance, Incapacity, Contentment and Attainment, have been described. This is the creation of intellect known as “dispositions”. “Linga” has also been mentioned as the creation of the subtle elements ending with the fourteen kinds of created beings. Now, when the aim of the Spirit can be attained by one sort of creation only, where is the necessity of both kinds of creations?This is explained There can be no Linga without dispositions, nor elaboration of dispositions without Linga.
liṅgākhyo bhāvākhyastasmādvividhaḥ pravarttate sargaḥ //	Therefore, proceeds the twofold creation. viz., that of Linga and that of dispositions.
bhāvaiḥ pratyayasargairvinā liṃgaṃ na tanmātrasargo na pūrvapūrvasaṃskārādṛṣṭakāritatvāduttarottaradehalambhasya liṃgena tanmātrasargeṇa ca vinā bhāvanirvṛttirna sthūlasūkṣmadehasādhyatvāddharmāderanāditvācca sargasya bījāṃkurāvanyonyāśrayau na doṣāya tattajjātīyāpekṣitatve 'pi tattadvyaktīnāṃ parasparānapekṣitvāttasmādbhāvākhyo liṃgākhyaśca dvividhaḥ pravarttate sarga iti //	Because every successive body is acquired by the impressions of the actions performed in previous birth. Without lingathe creation of intellect,there can be no elaboration of dispositions because, Virtue and the rest can be acquired by the formation of subtle and gross bodies. The mutual dependence of these two, like that of seed and sprout, is not a fault, because the creation is beginningless and although the different species stand in need of mutual dependence, the different individuals do not. Therefore, twofold creation proceeds, namely, that of linga and that of dispositions.
kiṃ cānyat / aṣṭavikalpo daivastairyagyonaśca pañcadhā bhavati /	Moreover The divine class has eight varieties, the subhuman has five and the human has one only.

Now it is explainedwhat is supreme in which world Above, there is predominence of Sattva below, the creation abounds in Tamas in the midst, the Rajas predominates this is so from Brahman down to stock.
ūrddhvamityaṣṭasu devasthāneṣu sattvaviśālaṃ sattvavistāraḥ sattvotkaṭa ūrddhvasattva iti /	Above i.e., in the eight regions of gods, the creation is Sattvaviśāla, i.e., has prevalence of Sattva in other words, has excessiveness or predominence of Sattva.
tatrāpi rajastamasī staḥ /	Of course, Rajas and Tamas also reside there.
tamoviśālo mūlataḥ paśvādiṣu sthāvarānteṣu sarvaḥsargastamasādhikyena vyāptastatrāpi sattvarajasī staḥ /	Below the creation abounds in Tamas. From animals down to immobile beings, the entire creation is pervaded, by Tamas in excess. Of course, even there Sattva and Rajas are present.
madhye mānuṣye raja utkaṭaṃ tatrāpi sattvatamasī vidyete tasmādduḥkhaprāyā manuṣyāḥ /	In the midst, i.e., in human creation, Rajas is strong. Even here, Sattva and Tamas are present. Therefore, human beings are mostly in pain.
evaṃ brahmādistambaparyantaḥ brahmādisthāvarāntaḥ ityarthaḥ /	Thus, from Brahman down to stock, i.e., from Brahman down to immobile beings.
evamabhautikaḥ sargo liṃgasargo bhāvasargo bhūtasargo daivamānuṣatairyagyonaya ityeṣaḥ pradhānakṛtaḥ ṣoḍaśaḥ sargaḥ //	Thus, nonelemental creation, creation of the subtle elements, creation of dispositions, creation of the gross elements and the divine, subhuman and human creations are the sixteen varieties of creation produced by the Nature.
tatra jarāmaraṇakṛtaṃ duḥkhaṃ prāpnoti cetanaḥ puruṣaḥ / liṅgasyāvinivṛttestasmādduḥkhaṃ samāsena //	There, the intelligent Spirit experiences pain due to old age and death, till the cessation of the Linga hence misery is of the nature of things.

kiyantaṃ kālaṃ puruṣo duḥkhaṃ prāpnotīti tadvivinakti /	Now, the author discussesHow long does the Spirit suffer from misery?

As long as the Mahat and the rest, which manifest themselves after entering the subtle body, do not cease, i.e., as long as this migratory body does not cease, so long, in brief, does the Spirit experience pain due to old age and death in the three worlds. Till the cessation of linga means, till the subtle body has ceased to be.
liṃganivṛttau mokṣo mokṣaprāptau nāsti duḥkhamiti /	After the cessation of the subtle body there is salvation after the attainment of salvation there is no misery.

By the attainment of the knowledge of twentyfive principles in the shape of the distinctness of the Nature from the Spirit. By such knowledge, i.e., this is Nature, this is intellect, this is ego, these are the five gross elements, different and distinct from which is the Spirit,the subtle body ceases to be, and then the salvation is attained.
ityeṣa prakṛtikṛto mahadādiviṣayabhūtaparyantaḥ / pratipuruṣavimokṣārthaṃ svārtha iva parārtha ārambhaḥ //	Next is explained the purpose of Nature’s activity or effort Thus, this effort in the activity of the Nature, beginning from Mahat down to the gross elements, is for the liberation of each Spirit and although it is for another’s benefit yet it seems as if it were for itself.
ityeṣa parisamāptau nirddeśe ca prakṛtivikṛtau prakṛtikaraṇe prakṛtikriyāyāṃ ya ārambho mahadādiviśeṣabhūtaparyantaḥ prakṛtermahān mahato 'haṃkārastasmāttanmātrāṇyekādaśendriyāṇi tanmātrebhyaḥ pañcamahābhūtānītyeṣaḥ pratipuruṣavimokṣārthaṃ puruṣaṃ prati devamanuṣyatiryagbhāvaṃ gatānāṃ vimokṣārthamārambhaḥ kathaṃ svārtha iva parārthamārambhaḥ yathā kaścit svārthaṃ tyaktvā mitrakāryāṇi karoti evaṃ pradhānam /	Prakṛtikṛtau means, in the instrumentality or the activity of the Nature. This effort, beginning from Mahat down to the gross elementsfrom Nature intellect, from intellect ego from ego the subtle elements and eleven organs from the subtle elements the five gross elements this one, Is for the liberation of each Spirit, i.e., Spirit which has assumed divine, subhuman forms for the liberation of these Spirits is of the Nature. How?Although this effort is for another’s benefit, yet it seems as if it were for itself. The Nature behaves like that man who forsakes his own business and performs that of his friend.
puruṣo 'tra pradhānasya na kiñcit pratyupakāraṃ karoti /	The Spirit in no way does any good to Nature in return.
svārtha iva na ca svāthaḥ parārtha evārthaḥ śabdādiviṣayopalabdhirguṇapuruṣāntaropalabdhiśca triṣu lokeṣu śabdādiviṣayaiḥ puruṣā yojayitavyā ante ca mokṣeṇeti pradhānasya pravṛttistathā coktam /	It is, as if it were for itself, not actually for itself i.e., for another’s benefit. The benefit is the acquisition of the objects of senses like sound and the rest, and the comprehension of distinctness between the Attributes i.e., Nature and the Spirit. The effort of the Nature is for this purpose.In all the three worlds, the Spirits are to be supplied with the objects of senses like sound and the rest, and at the end the Spirits are to be provided with salvation.
atrocyate 'cetanaṃ pradhānaṃ cetanaḥ puruṣa iti mayā triṣu lokeṣu śabdādibhirviṣayaiḥ puruṣo yojyo 'nte mokṣaḥ karttavya iti kathaṃ cetanavat pravṛtiḥ /	Then, how can the Nature act like an intelligent principle, thinking, ‘I should supply the Spirit with the objects of senses like sound and the rest in all the three worlds, and should provide the Spirit with liberation at the end’?
satyaṃ kiṃtvacetanānāmapi pravṛttirdṛṣṭā nivṛttiśca yasmādityāha / vatsavivṛddhinimittaṃ kṣīrasya yathā pravṛttirajñasya / puruṣavimokṣanimittaṃ tathā pravṛttiḥ pradhānasya //	True, we reply. Because activity and cessation from activity have been observed in the case of nonintelligent things also therefore, says the author, the Nature acts As nonintelligent milk functions for the nourishment of calf, so does the Nature function for the liberation of the Spirit.
yathā tṛṇādikaṃ gavā bhakṣitaṃ kṣīrabhāvena pariṇamya vatsavivṛddhiṃ karoti puṣṭe ca vatse nivarttata evaṃ puruṣavimokṣanimittaṃ pradhānam /	Just as grass and the like consumed by a cow and modified as milk nourish the calf and after its nourishment cease, so does the Nature function for the liberation of the Spirit.
ajñasya pravṛttirita //	Thus, there is activity in the nonintelligent Nature.
autsukyanivṛttyarthaṃ yathā kriyāsu pravartate lokaḥ / puruṣasya vimokṣārthaṃ pravartate tadvadavyaktam //	Moreover, As people engage in action for relieving desires, so does the Unmanifest for liberating the Spirit.

raṅgasya darśayitvā nivartate nartakī yathā nṛtyāt / puruṣasya tathātmānaṃ prakāśya nivartate prakṛtiḥ //	And again, As a dancer desists from dancing after showing herself to the audience, so the Nature desists after showing itself to the Spirit.
yathā narttakī śṛṅgārādirasauritihāsādibhāvaiśca nibaddhagītavāditravṛttāni raṅgasya darśayitvā kṛtakāryā nṛtyānnivarttate tathā prakṛtirapi puruṣasyātmānaṃ prakāśya buddhyahaṃkāratanmātrendiyamahābhūtabhedena nivartate //	As a dancer, having exhibited to the audience the episodes which are set to music in the form of songs, and which are full of the sentiments of love and the like, by means of her graceful movements, desists from dancing after discharging her duty, so also does the Nature, having exhibited itself to the Spirit in the different characters of intellect, ego, the subtle elements and the gross elements desist.
kathaṃ ko vā syānnivarttako hetustadāha / nānāvidhairupāyairupakāriṇyanupakāriṇaḥ puṃsaḥ /	Next is explainedHow and what is the cause of the cessation of the activity of Nature Generous Nature, endowed with the Attributes, without any benefit to itself, causes by manifold means the benefit of the Spirit which is devoid of the Attributes and which confers no benefit in return.
guṇavatyaguṇasya satastasyārthamapārthakaṃ carati //	By manifold means does the Nature benefit the Spirit which Spirit confers no benefit in return.
nānāvidhairupāyaiḥ prakṛtiḥ puruṣasyopakāriṇyanupakāriṇaḥ puṃsaḥ kathaṃ devamānuṣatiryagbhāvena sukhaduḥkhamohātmakabhāvena śabdādiviṣayabhāvena evaṃ nānāvidhairupāyairātmānaṃ prakāśyāhamanyā tvamanya iti nivarttate 'to nityasya tasyārthamapārthaṃ kurute carati ca yathā kaścit paropakārī sarvasyopakurute nātmanaḥ pratyupakāramīhata evaṃ prakṛtiḥ puruṣārthaṃ kurute karotyapārthakam //	In what way does the Nature benefit?By transforming itself into divine, subhuman and human forms by transforming itself into pleasure, pain and delusion, and by transforming itself into the objects of senses in the shape of sound and the rest. n this way, having exhibited itself to the Spirit by manifold means,‘I am one thou art another’,the Nature desists. Thus, it causes the benefit of the eternal Spirit without any benefit to itself. Just as a generous person does good to all and wants no good in return, so does the Nature effect the purpose of the Spirit, without any return.
paścāduktamātmānaṃ prakāśya nivarttate nivṛtta ca kiṃ karotītyāha / prakṛteḥ sukumārataraṃ na kiñcidastīti me matirbhavati / yā dṛṣṭāsmīti punarna darśanamupaiti puruṣasya //	It was said above under Kār. “The Nature desists after exhibiting itself.” Next is explained what it does after having desisted Nothing in my opinion is more modest than Nature, who because of thinking that “I have been seen”, never again exposes itself to the view of the Spirit.
loke prakṛteḥ sukumārataraṃ na kiñcidastītyevaṃ me matirbhavati yena parārtha evaṃ matirutpannā kasmādahamanena puruṣeṇa dṛṣṭāsmītyasya puṃso punardarśanaṃ nopaiti puruṣasyādarśanamupayātītyarthaḥ /	In this world, nothing is more modest than Nature,such is my opinion. Because, such an idea to be stated below, arose for another i.e., the Spirit. Why? “I have been seen by this Spirit”, thinking so, the Nature never exposes itself to the view of the Spirit, i.e., becomes invisible to the Spirit.
tatra sukumārataraṃ varṇayati /	Now the characteristic of being more modest is explained.
īśvaraṃ kāraṇaṃ bruvate / "ajo janturanīśo 'yamātmā naḥ sukhaduḥkhayorīśvaraprerito gacchet svargaṃ narakameva vā //" apare svabhāvakāraṇikāṃ bruvate /	Some advocate God to be the cause “The ignorant being is helpless with regard to his pleasure and pain. He goes lo heaven or hell, as impelled by God.” Mbh. III, . Others who advocate Spontaneity as the cause, say “Who whitened the swans?
kena śuklīkṛtā haṃsā mayūrāḥ kena citritāḥ /	Who made the peacocks variegated?” The reply is, the Spontaneity alone.
atra sāṃkhyācāryā āhuḥ nirguṇatvādīśvarasya kathaṃ saguṇataḥ prajā jāyeran kathaṃ vā puruṣānnirguṇādeva tasmāt prakṛteryujyate yathā śuklebhyastantubhyaḥ śukla eva paṭo bhavati kṛṣṇebhyaḥ kṛṣṇa eveti / evaṃ triguṇāt pradhānāt trayo lokāstriguṇāḥ samutpannā iti gamyate /	Here, the teachers of Sāmkhya say in this connectionHow can the beings endowed with the Attributes be created by God who is Attributeless? Or, how even by the Attributeless Spirit? Therefore, the causality of the Nature is proper. Just as from white yarn, only white cloth is produced and from black yarn, only black cloth, so it is inferred that the three worlds endowed with the three Attributes, proceed from the Nature endowed with the three Attributes.
nirguṇa īśvaraḥ saguṇānāṃ lokānāṃ tasmādutpattirayukteti /	God is Attributeless therefore, production of this world endowed with the three Attributes is illogical from Him.
anena puruṣo vyākhyātaḥ /	This explains away also the possibility of the Spirit being regarded as a cause.
tathā keṣāṃcit kālaḥ kāraṇamityuktaṃ ca /	Some regard Time as the cause it is said “Time rears lit.
"kālaḥ pañcāsti bhūtāni kālaḥ saṃharate jagat / kālaḥ supteṣu jāgartti kālo hi duratikramaḥ //" vyaktamavyaktapuruṣāstrayaḥ padārthāstena kālo 'ntarbhūto 'sti sa vyaktaḥ sarvakartṛtvāt kālasyāpi pradhānameva kāraṇaṃ svabhāvo 'pyatraiva līnaḥ tasmāt kālo na kāraṇam /	cooks the beings Time withdraws the world Time is awake while the others sleep Time is not to be surpassed.” To this we replyThere are only three categories, viz., the Manifest, the Unmanifest and the Knower. Time also is included under one of them. Time is Manifest. And as the Nature is the producer of all, so it must be the cause of Time also.
nāpi svabhāva iti /	Spontaneity is also included there.
tasmāt prakṛtireva kāraṇaṃ na prakṛteḥ kāraṇāntaramastīti /	Therefore, neither Spontaneity nor Time is the cause the Nature alone is the cause and there is no other cause of the Nature.
na punardarśanamupayāti puruṣasya /	Does not again come within the view of the Spirit.
ataḥ prakṛteḥ sukumārataraṃ subhogyataraṃ na kiñcidīśvarādikāraṇamastīti me matirbhavati //	Therefore, in my opinion, there is no other cause, like Iśvara and the rest which may be more modest, more enjoyable than the Nature.
tathā ca śloke rūḍham / puruṣo muktaḥ puruṣaḥ saṃsārīti coditetyāha / tasmānna badhyate nāpi mucyate nāpi saṃsarati kaścit /	But if it be urged that it is a practice in this world to say that the Spirit is liberated, the Spirit migrates.To this the author replies Therefore, not any Spirit is bound or liberated, nor does any migrate.
saṃsarati badhyate mucyate ca nānāśrayā prakṛtiḥ //	It is the Nature, abiding in manifold forms, that migrates or is bound or liberated.
tasmāt kāraṇāt puruṣo na badhyate nāpi mucyate nāpi saṃsarati yasmāt kāraṇāt prakṛtireva nānāśrayā daivamānuṣatiryagyonyāśrayā buddhyahaṃkāratanmātrendriyabhūtasvarūpeṇa badhyate mucyate saṃsarati ceti /	For this reason, the Spirit is not bound or liberated, nor does it migrate because, it is the Nature alone, abiding manifold forms, i.e., abiding in divine, human and subhuman forms, which is bound or liberated or migrates in the forms of intellect, ego, the subtle elements, the organs and the gross elements.
atha mukta eva svabhāvāt sa sarvagataśca kathaṃ saṃsaratyaprāptaprāpaṇārthaṃ saṃsaraṇamiti tena puruṣo badhyate puruṣo mucyate saṃsarati vyapadiśyate yena saṃsāritvaṃ na vidyate sattvapuruṣāntajñānāt tattvaṃ puruṣasyābhivyajyate /	If the Spirit is spontaneously liberated and is all pervading, then why does it migrate? The migration is for the purpose of acquiring that which is not previously attained. To this the reply isThe phrases, ‘the Spirit is bound’, ‘the Spirit is liberated’, ‘the Spirit migrates’,are used because the nature of migration is not properly understood by people.
tadabhivyakto kevalaḥ śuddho muktaḥ svarūpapratiṣṭhaḥ puruṣa iti /	After its manifestation, the Spirit becomes single, liberated and established in its own nature.
atra yadi puruṣasya bandho nasti tato mokṣo 'pi nāsti /	Well, if the Spirit is not bound, then it is not even liberated.
atrocyate prakṛtirevātmānaṃ badhnāti mocayati ca yatra sūkṣmaśarīraṃ tanmātrakaṃ trividhakaraṇopetaṃ tat trividhena bandhena badhyate /	To this we replyIt is the Nature alone which binds or liberates itself. For, wherever, the subtle body endowed with the subtle elements and the threefold internal organs, exists, such body is bound by triple bondage.
uktaṃ ca prākṛtena ca bandhena tathā vaikārikeṇa ca /	As it has already been saidunder Kār.
dākṣiṇena tṛtīyena baddho nānyena mucyate / tat sūkṣmaṃ śarīraṃ dharmādharmaṃ saṃyuktam //	“He who is bound by the connate, natural and personal bondages is not liberated by anything else except knowledge.” And that subtle body is endowed with Virtue and Vice.
prakṛtiśca badhyate prakṛtiśca mucyate saṃsaratīti kathaṃ taducyate / rūpaiḥ saptabhirevaṃ badhnātyātmānamātmanā prakṛtiḥ /	How is it that the Nature is bound, the Nature is liberated and the Nature migrates?It is replied The Nature binds itself by itself through seven forms alone the same Nature, for the purpose of the Spirit, liberates itself through one form.
rūpaiḥ saptabhirevaitāni sapta procyante dharmo vairāgyamaiśvaryamadharmo 'jñānamavairāgyamanaiśvaryyametāni prakṛteḥ saptarūpāṇi tairātmānaṃ svaṃ badhnāti prakṛtirātmānaṃ svameva saiva prakṛtiḥ puruṣasyārthaḥ puruṣārthaḥ karttavya iti vimocayatyātmānamekarūpeṇa jñānena //	Through seven forms alone. These seven forms areVirtue, Nonattachment, Power, Vice, Ignorance, Attachment and Absence of Power these are the seven forms of the Nature, Through these the Nature binds itself by itself. The same Nature thinking, that the purpose of the Spirit is to be accomplished, liberates itself through one form of knowledge.
kathaṃ tajjñānamutpadyate / evaṃ tattvābhyāsānnāsmi na me nāhamityapariśeṣam / aviparyayādviśuddhaṃ kevalamutpadyate jñānam //	How is that knowledge produced?It is replied By practising the principles thus, there arises the kmowledge, viz., ‘I am not, naught is mine, there is no Ego’, which is complete, absolute and pure, because there remains no doubt.

Pure, because there remains no doubt. Viparyaya means doubt. Aviparayayāt, i.e., because there remains no doubt, it knowledge is pure. Absolute, i.e., only this knowledge is the cause of salvation and no other.

By this knowledge, the Spirit, seated composed like a spectator, perceives the Nature which has ceased to be productive and, consequently, which has now reverted from seven forms.

Consequently, which has now reverted from seven forms. Because, it has fulfilled both the purposes of enjoyment and release of the Spirit. The Spirit perceives the Nature which has reverted from the seven forms,the seven forms of Virtue and the rest by which the Nature binds itself.

Like a spectator in a play, the one absolute and pure Spirit is indifferent. ‘I have been seen by it Spirit’,thinking like that desists the one, i.e., the Nature, which is the sole and the chief cause of all the three worlds. There is no second Nature, because, if there be another form, then it will be a variety of genus. Although, the Spirit and Nature both desist thus, and on account of their omnipresence there is Contact between the two, yet there is no creation resulting from that contact.

There are two motives for creation i the apprehension of the objects of senses, like sound and the rest, and ii the apprehension of discrimination between the Attributes and the Spirit.

Like the whirl of a wheel. As a potter, having set his wheel in motion, makes a pot by putting clay on the wheel after making the pot he forsakes the wheel, but the wheel continues to turn round on account of the past momentum. Thus, by the attainment of perfect knowledge, i.e., in the case of a man in whom perfect knowledge is produced Virtue and the rest cease to be producers. That is, these Seven forms of bondage are burnt destroyed by perfect knowledge.

Why does not the knowledge destroy Virtue and Vice of the present birth?Because, they are present. Of course, the next moment they are destroyed. Knowledge destroys all the future actions, as well as those which are done by the present body, by engaging in actions prescribed by the Scriptures. After the exhaustion of the previous impressions, the body perishes and salvation results.
