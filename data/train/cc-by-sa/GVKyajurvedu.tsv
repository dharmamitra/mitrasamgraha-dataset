They say, 'They foam over the barrier, they foam over speech, but over mind they do not foam.' He brings them forward with mind; mind is this (earth) [1]; verily with this (earth) he brings them forward.

If he were to collect them one by one, they would have the Pitrs as their divinity; if all together, (they would have) men as their divinity. He collects them in pairs, and so he makes the form of the Yajya and the Anuvakya, and thus there is a pair. If a man knows the ten weapons of the sacrifice, his sacrifice is in order at the beginning.

If a man sacrifices after announcing the sacrifice to the gods, they delight in his sacrifice. He should as the oblation is being offered recite (the words), 'Agni, the priest, him I summon hither' [3].
devebhya eva pratiprocya yajñena yajate juṣante 'sya devā havyam eṣa vai yajñasya graho gṛhītvaiva yajñena yajate tad uditvā vācaṃ yachati yajñasya dhṛtyai |	Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods and sacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the taking of the sacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he sacrifices. After speaking he remains silent, to support the sacrifice.

He who yokes the sacrifice when the yoking (time) arrives yokes it indeed among the yokers. 'Who (ka) yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee', he says. Ka is Prajapati--verily by Prajapati he yokes it;

These he meted out; the Agnistoma was the size of the Agnihotra, the Ukthya that of the full moon sacrifice, the Atiratra that of the new moon sacrifice.
ya evaṃ vidvān agnihotraṃ juhoti yāvad agniṣṭomenopāpnoti tāvad upāpnoti ya evaṃ vidvān paurṇamāsīṃ yajate yāvad ukthyenopāpnoti |	He who knowing thus offers the Agnihotra obtains as much as by offering the Agnistoma; he who knowing thus offers the full moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Ukthya [1];

This sacrifice was in the beginning Paramesthin's, and by means of it he reached the supreme goal. He furnished Prajapati with it, and by means of it Prajapati reached the supreme goal. He furnished Indra with it, and by means of it Indra reached the supreme goal.

He who sacrifices with an abundant offering is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. 'The year has twelve months, there are twelve pairs of new and full moon sacrifices;
ava ca hanti dṛṣadau ca samāhanti |	these are to be produced', they say.
adhi ca vapate kapālāni copa dadhāti puroḍāśaṃ ca | adhiśrayaty ājyaṃ ca stambayajuś ca haraty abhi ca gṛhṇāti vediṃ ca pari gṛhṇāti patnīṃ ca saṃ nahyati prokṣaṇīś cāsādayaty ājyaṃ ca |	He lets the calf go free and puts the pot on the fire: he puts down (the rice), and beats the millstones together; he scatters (the grains) and collects the potsherds; the cake [3] he puts on the fire and the melted butter; he throws the clump of grass, and gathers it in;
etāni vai dvādaśa dvaṃdvāni darśapūrṇamāsayos tāni ya evaṃ sampādya yajate prajātenaiva yajñena yajate pra prajayā paśubhir mithunair jāyate |	These are the twelve pairs in the new and full moon sacrifices. He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with an abundant offering and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings.
dhruvo 'si dhruvo 'haṃ sajāteṣu bhūyāsam ity āha dhruvān evainān kurute |	'Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals', he says; verily he makes them secure.' 'Thou art dread;
ugro 'sy ugro 'haṃ sajāteṣu bhūyāsam ity āhāprativādina evainān kurute |	may I be dread among my equals'; verily he makes them harmonious.
abhibhūr asy abhibhūr ahaṃ sajāteṣu bhūyāsam ity āha ya evainam pratyutpipīte tam upāsyate yunajmi tvā brahmaṇā daivyenety āhaiṣa vā agner yogas tena |	'Thou art overcoming; may I be overcoming among my equals,' he says; verily he overthrows him who rises against him. 'I yoke thee with the divine Brahman', he says; this is the yoking of the fire;
evainaṃ yunakti yajñasya vai samṛddhena devāḥ suvargaṃ lokam āyan yajñasya vyṛddhenāsurān parā bhāvayan yan me agne asya yajñasya riṣyād ity āha yajñasyaiva tat samṛddhena yajamānaḥ suvargaṃ lokam eti yajñasya vyṛddhena bhrātṛvyān parā bhāvayati |	verily [1] with it he yokes it. With the prosperous part of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part they overcame the Asuras. 'Whatever, O Agni, in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled', he says; verily with the prosperous part of the sacrifice the sacrificer goes to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part he overcomes the foes.
agnihotram etābhir vyāhṛtībhir upa sādayed yajñamukhaṃ vā agnihotram brahmaitā vyāhṛtayo yajñamukha eva brahma |	The Agnihotra is the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman [2].

The new and full moon and the four monthly sacrifices are the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman. When the year is completed, he should thus with them (Vyahrtis) set down (the oblations), and so with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. To the kingly class falls the blessing of the part of the sacrifice which is performed with the Saman [3];

If he desire of a sacrificer, 'May the blessing of his sacrifice fall to his foe', he should insert for him those Vyahrtis in the Puronuvakya (verse);
āśīr gachati yān kāmayeta yajamānānt samāvaty enān yajñasyāśīr ghached iti teṣām etā vyāhṛtīḥ puro'nuvākyāyā ardharca ekāṃ dadhyād yājyāyai purastād ekāṃ yājyāyā ardharca ekāṃ tathainānt samāvatī yajñasyāśīr gachati yathā vai parjanyaḥ suvṛṣṭaṃ varṣaty evaṃ yajño yajamānasya varṣati sthalayodakam parigṛhṇanty āśiṣā yajñaṃ yajamānaḥ pari gṛhṇāti mano 'si prājāpatyam |	verily the blessing of his sacrifice falls to his foe [4]. If he desire of sacrificers, 'May the blessing of the sacrifice fall to them equally', he should place for them one of the Vyahrtis at the half-verse of the Puronuvakya, one before the Yajya, and one at the half-verse of the Yajya, and thus the blessing of the sacrifice falls to them equally. Even as Parjanya rains down good rain, so the sacrifice rains for the sacrificer; they surround the water with a mound, the sacrificer surrounds the sacrifice with a blessing.

'Thou art speech, derived from Indra, destroying the foe;

Then for them the quarters were made to swell; for him who knows thus the quarters are made to swell. One knows Prajapati, Prajapati knows one;
eṣa vai chandasyaḥ prajāpatir ā śrāvayāstu śrauṣaḍ yaja ye yajāmahe vaṣaṭkāras |	This is the Prajapati of the texts, 'Do thou proclaim', 'Be it proclaimed', 'Utter', 'We that do utter', the Vasat call;

yad dyāva indra te śataṃ śatam bhūmīr uta syuḥ | na tvā vajrint sahasraṃ sūryā anu na jātam aṣṭa rodasī |	If, O Indra, a hundred skies, hundred earths were thine, Not a thousand suns could match thee at birth, Nor the two worlds.
pibā somam indra mandatu tvā yaṃ te suṣāva haryaśvādriḥ | sotur bāhubhyāṃ suyato nārvā |	Drink the Soma, O Indra; let it gladden thee, (The Soma) which for thee, O lord of bays, the stone Through the arms of the presser [3], like a horse well guided hath expressed.
revatīr naḥ sadhamāda indre santu tuvivājāḥ | kṣumanto yābhir madema |	With Indra may splendid feasts be ours, Rich in strength, Wherewith we may rejoice in food.

āprā dyāvāpṛthivī antarikṣaṃ sūrya ātmā jagatas tasthuṣaḥ |	He hath filled the sky, the earth, and the atmosphere; Surya is the soul of that which moveth and standeth [4].
viśve devā ṛtāvṛdha ṛtubhir havanaśrutaḥ | juṣantāṃ yujyam payaḥ |	May the All-gods who further right, Who hearken to the call in due season, Find pleasure in this proper drink.

ye agnijihvā uta vā yajatrā āsadyāsmin barhiṣi mādayadhvam |	Ye with Agni as your tongue, worthy of sacrifice, Sit on this strew and rejoice.
viśvarūpo vai tvāṣṭraḥ purohito devānām āsīt svasrīyo 'surāṇām |	The New and Full Moon Sacrifices Viçvarupa, son of Tvastr, was the domestic priest of the gods, and the sister's son of the Asuras.
tasya trīṇi śīrṣāṇy āsant somapānaṃ surāpānam annādanam |	He had three heads, one which drank Soma, one Sura, and one which ate food.

Men promise openly the share to every one; if they promise any one secretly, his share is indeed promised. Therefore Indra was afraid (thinking), 'Such an one is diverting the sovereignty (from me).' He took his bolt and smote off his heads.
āsīt sa kapiñjalo 'bhavat yat surāpānaṃ sa kalaviṅko yad annādanaṃ sa tittiris |	(The head) which drank Soma [1] became a hazelcock; (the head) which drank Sura a sparrow;
sa pṛthivīm upāsīdat |	(the head) which ate food a partridge.
asyai brahmahatyāyai tṛtīyam prati gṛhāṇeti sābravīt | varaṃ vṛṇai khātāt parābhaviṣyantī manye tato mā parā bhūvam iti purā te |	Creatures called out upon him, 'Thou art a Brahman slayer.' He appealed to the earth, 'Take a third part of my guilt.' She said, 'Let me choose a boon.

He replied, 'Before [2] a year is out it will grow up for thee.' Therefore before the year is out the dug-out portion of earth grows up again, for that was what she chose as a boon. She took a third of his guilt.
sa vanaspatīn upāsīdat |	That became a natural fissure;
asyai brahmahatyāyai tṛtīyam prati gṛhṇīteti te 'bruvan varaṃ vṛṇāmahai vṛkṇāt |	He appealed to the trees, 'Take a third part of my guilt.' They said, 'Let us choose a boon.
parābhaviṣyanto manyāmahe tato mā parā bhūmeti |	We deem that we shall be overcome through pruning [3].
āvraścanād vo bhūyāṃsa ut tiṣṭhān ity abravīt tasmād āvraścanād vṛkṣāṇām bhūyāṃsa ut tiṣṭhanti vārevṛtaṃ hy eṣām |	Let us not be overcome by that.' He replied, 'From pruning shall more (shoots) spring up for you.' Therefore from the pruning of trees more (shoots) spring up, for that was what they chose as a boon.

Or rather of the sap which is red or which comes from the pruning one should not partake [4], but of other sap at will.
sa strīṣaṃsādam upāsīdat | asyai brahmahatyāyai tṛtīyam prati gṛhṇīteti tā abruvan varaṃ vṛṇāmahā ṛtviyāt prajāṃ vindāmahai kāmam ā vijanitoḥ sam bhavāmeti tasmād ṛtviyāt striyaḥ prajāṃ vindante kāmam ā vijanitoḥ sam bhavanti vārevṛtaṃ hy āsām |	He appealed to a concourse of women, 'Take the third of my guilt.' They said, 'Let us choose a boon; let us obtain offspring from after the menses; let us enjoy intercourse at will up to birth.' Therefore women obtain offspring from after the menses, and enjoy intercourse at will up to birth, for that was what they chose as a boon.

atho khalv āhus | abhyañjanaṃ vāva striyā annam abhyañjanam eva na pratigṛhyaṃ kāmam anyad iti |	Or rather they say, 'Woman's food is unguent, and there fore one should not accept (from her) unguent, but anything else (can be accepted) at will.' The son born of intercourse with (a woman) with stained garments is accursed;
yām malavadvāsasaṃ sambhavanti yas tato jāyate so 'bhiśasto yām araṇye tasyai steno yām parācīṃ tasyai hrītamukhy apagalbho yā snāti tasyā apsu māruko yā |	(the son born) of intercourse with a woman bathing is fated to drown; (the son born) of one who [6] anoints herself has a skin disease; (the son born) of one who combs her hair is bald and feeble; (the son born) of one who anoints (her eyes) is blind;

For three nights he should keep a vow and should drink from his hand or from a perfect vessel, to guard his offspring.

Indra desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him; (saying) 'Thou hast slain my son.' He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), (saying), 'Hail!
yad abravīt svāhendraśatrur vardhasveti tasmād asya |	wax great, Indra's foe.' In that he cast it (avartayat), Vrtra is Vrtra;
indraḥ śatrur abhavat sa sambhavann agnīṣomāv abhi sam abhavat sa iṣumātramiṣumātraṃ viṣvaṅṅ avardhata sa imāM lokān avṛṇot |	wax great, Indra's foe', therefore [1] Indra became his foe. He sprang into life and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on all sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds.
yad imāM lokān avṛṇot tad vṛtrasya vṛtratvam |	Because he enveloped these worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra.
tasmād indro 'bibhet sa prajāpatim upādhāvat | śatrur me 'janīti tasmai vajraṃ siktvā prāyachat |	Indra feared him. He ran up to Prajapati, (saying), 'A foe has sprung up for me.' He dipped his bolt and gave it to him, (saying), 'Slay with it.' He went against (him) with it.
etena jahīti tenābhy āyata tāv abrūtām agnīṣomau mā |	Agni and Soma said, 'Hurl it not [2];
pra hār āvam antaḥ sva iti mama vai yuvaṃ stha ity abravīn mām abhy etam iti tau bhāgadheyam aichetām |	we are within.' 'Ye are mine', he replied, 'come to me.' They asked for a share;
tābhyām etam agnīṣomīyam ekādaśakapālam pūrṇamāse prāyachat tāv abrūtām abhi saṃdaṣṭau vai svo na śaknuva aitum iti sa indra ātmanaḥ śītarūrāv ajanayat tac chītarūrayor janma ya evaṃ śītarūrayor janma veda |	he gave them at the full moon this offering for Agni and Soma on eleven potsherds. They said, 'We are bitten all round, and cannot come.' Indra produced from himself cold and fever heat; that was the origin of cold and fever heat. Him who knows thus the origin of cold and fever heat [3] neither cold nor fever heat slays.

Then expiration and inspiration deserted him; skill is expiration, intelligence is inspiration; therefore one who gapes should say, 'Skill and intelligence (remain) in me';
mayi dakṣakratū iti prāṇāpānāv evātman dhatte sarvam āyur eti sa devatā vṛtrān nirhūya vārtraghnaṃ haviḥ pūrṇamāse nir avapat |	verily he places expiration and inspiration in himself and lives all his days. He, having called off the gods from. Vrtra offered at the full moon the oblation to the Vrtra slayer;
ghnanti vā enam pūrṇamāsa ā |	they slay him at the full moon [4], but make him swell at the new moon;
amāvāsyāyām pyāyayanti tasmād vārtraghnī pūrṇamāse 'nūcyete vṛdhanvatī amāvāsyāyām |	therefore verses are uttered at the full moon referring to the slaying of Vrtra, at the new moon referring to his increase.

Sky and earth said, 'Hurl it not; he rests in us two.' They said, 'Let us choose a boon.' 'May I be adorned with the Naksatras', said yonder (sky); I May I be adorned with variegated things', said this (earth).
tasmān nakṣatravihitāsau citravihiteyam | ya evaṃ dyāvāpṛthivyoḥ |	Therefore yonder (sky) is adorned with the Naksatras, this (earth) with variegated things.

Indra thus impelled by these two slew Vrtra. The gods having slain Vrtra said to Agni and Soma, 'Bear the offering for us.' They said, 'We two have lost our brilliance, our brilliance is in Vrtra.' They said, 'Who is there to go for it?' 'The cow', they said, 'The cow is the friend of all.' She said [6], 'Let me choose a boon;
varaṃ vṛṇai mayy eva satobhayena bhunajādhvā iti tad gaur āharat tasmād gavi satobhayena bhuñjate |	ye shall feed off both when they are in me.' The cow brought the (brilliance); therefore they feed off both things that are in the cow;
etad vā agnes tejo yad ghṛtam etat somasya yat payas |	ghee indeed is the brilliance of Agni, milk the brilliance of Soma.
ya evam agnīṣomayos tejo veda tejasvy eva bhavati brahmavādino vadanti kiṃdevatyam paurṇamāsam iti prājāpatyam iti brūyāt tenendraṃ jyeṣṭham putraṃ niravāsāyayad iti tasmāj jyeṣṭham putraṃ dhanena niravasāyayanti |	He who knows thus the brilliance of Agni and Soma becomes brilliant. The theologians say, 'What is the deity of the full moon (rite)?' He should reply, 'Prajapati; by means of it he established his eldest son, Indra.' Therefore they establish their eldest sons with wealth.
indraṃ vṛtraṃ jaghanivāṃsam mṛdho 'bhi prāvepanta sa etaṃ vaimṛdham pūṇamāse 'nunirvāpyam apaśyat taṃ nir avapat tena vai sa mṛdho 'pāhata yad vaimṛdhaḥ pūrṇamāse 'nunirvāpyo bhavati mṛdha eva tena yajamāno 'pa hate |	When Indra had slain Vrtra, his enemies threatened him. He saw this enemy-dispelling (oblation) to be offered subsequently at the full moon. He offered it, and with it drove away his enemies. In that the enemy-dispelling (oblation) is to be offered subsequently at the full moon, the sacrificer by it drives away his enemies.
indro vṛtraṃ hatvā devatābhiś cendriyeṇa ca vy ārdhyata sa etam āgneyam aṣṭākapālam amāvāsyāyām apaśyad aindraṃ dadhi |	Indra, having slain Vrtra, lost the gods and his power. He saw the (offering) to Agni on eight potsherds at the new moon, and the curds for Indra [1].
taṃ nir avapat tena vai sa devatāś cendriyaṃ cāvārunddha yad āgneyo 'ṣṭākapālo 'māvāsyāyām bhavaty aindraṃ dadhi devatāś caiva tenendriyaṃ ca yajamāno 'va runddhe |	He offered it, and by it he won the gods and his power. In that at the new moon there is (an offering) to Agni on eight potsherds, and curds for Indra, the sacrificer wins by it the gods and power.
indrasya {F vṛtraṃ}{W vritraṃ}{GOLS vṛtraṃ} jaghnuṣa indriyaṃ vīryam pṛthivīm anu vy ārchat tad oṣadhayo vīrudho 'bhavan sa prajāpatim upādhāvad vṛtram me jaghnuṣa indriyaṃ vīryam |	When Indra had slain Vrtra, his power and strength went into the earth; then the plants and roots were born. He ran up to Prajapati, (saying), 'Now that I have slain Vrtra, my power and strength [2] have gone into the earth;
pṛthivīm anu vy ārat tad oṣadhayo vīrudho 'bhūvan iti tat paśava oṣadhībhyo 'dhy ātmant sam anayan tat praty aduhan yat samanayan tat sāṃnāyyasya sāṃnāyyatvaṃ yat pratyaduhan tat pratidhuṣaḥ pratidhuktvam |	then the plants and roots have been born.' Prajapati said to cattle, 'Collect it for him.' The cattle collected it from the plants in themselves; they milked it. In that they collected it, has the collected oblation (sammayya) its name; in that they milked it, has fresh milk its name (pratidhuk).
sam anaiṣuḥ praty adhukṣan na tu mayi śrayata ity abravīd etad asmai |	they have milked it; but it rests not in me', he said. 'Make it ready for him' [3], he replied.
śṛtaṃ kurutety abravīt tad asmai śṛtam akurvann indriyaṃ vāvāsmin vīryaṃ tad aśrayan tac chṛtasya śṛtatvam |	they made power and strength rest in him; verily the ready (milk) has its name (çrta). 'They have collected it; they have milked it; they have made it ready;
sam anaiṣuḥ praty adhukṣañ chṛtam akran na tu mā dhinotīty abravīd etad asmai dadhi kurutety abravīt tad asmai dadhy akurvan tad enam adhinot tad dadhno dadhitvam brahmavādino vadanti dadhnaḥ pūrvasyāvadeyam |	but it does not impel me', he said. 'Make it curds for him', he replied. They made it curds for him; that impelled (ahinot) him; verily curds (dadhi) has its name.

One should disregard that and offer ready (milk) first; verily one places power and strength in him and later impels him by curds; and he proceeds in order (of production). If he curdles it with Putika plants or with bark, that is fit for Soma;
sendratvāya |	if with rennet, for men;
agnihotrocheṣaṇam abhyātanakti yajñasya saṃtatyai |	He curdles the remains of the Agnihotra, for the continuity of the sacrifice.

The gods sought to start him. Prajapati said, I He who first finds him will have the first share.' The Pitrs found him; therefore an offering is made to the Pitrs on the day before.

The theologians say, What is the deity of the Samnayya?' 'The All-gods', he should reply, for so the All-gods won that as their share.' Or rather he should reply, 'Indra, for it was in healing Indra that they won it.' The theologians say, 'He would indeed offer the new and full moon (sacrifices) who should offer them with Indra.' At the full moon there is the subsequent offering of the enemy-dispelling (oblation), and by it the full moon has Indra. There are curds for Indra at the new moon;
iṣṭim apaśyan |	verily the new moon has Indra.
āgnāvaiṣṇavam ekādaśakapālaṃ sarasvatyai caruṃ sarasvate caruṃ tām paurṇamāsaṃ saṃsthāpyānu nir avapan tato devā abhavan parāsurās |	The gods [1] saw this offering, one on eleven potsherds for Agni and Visnu, an oblation for Sarasvati, an oblation for Sarasvant; after performing the full moon (sacrifice) they offered this.

With the full moon (sacrifice) he hurls the bolt at his enemy, with (the offering) to Agni and Visnu he appropriates the gods and the sacrifice of his enemy, his pairing cattle with (the offerings) to Sarasvati and Sarasvant.
sarvaṃ vṛṅkte paurṇamāsīm eva yajeta bhrātṛvyavān nāmāvāsyāṃ hatvā bhrātṛvyaṃ nā pyāyayati sākamprasthāyīyena yajeta paśukāmas |	One should sacrifice at the full moon, if one has enemies, not at the new moon; having slain one's enemy one does not cause him to grow again. He who desires cattle should sacrifice with the Sakamprasthayiya.
yasmai vā alpenāharanti nātmanā tṛpyati nānyasmai dadāti yasmai mahatā tṛpyaty ātmanā dadāty anyasmai mahatā pūrṇaṃ hotavyam |	The man to whom they bring (any thing) in small measure is not himself pleased, and does not give to another. But he, to whom they bring in large measure, is himself pleased, and gives to another. One should offer in full and large measure;
tṛpta evainam indraḥ prajayā paśubhis tarpayati dārupātreṇa juhoti na hi mṛnmayam āhutiṃ ānaśe |	Indra then being pleased delights him with offspring and cattle. He offers with a wooden vessel, for an earthenware one does not hold the offering.

bhavaty ūrg vā udumbara ūrk paśava ūrjaivāsmā ūrjam paśūn ava runddhe nāgataśrīr mahendraṃ yajeta trayo vai gataśriyaḥ śuśruvān grāmaṇī rājanyas teṣām mahendro devatā yo vai svāṃ devatāṃ atiyajate prasvāyai devatāyai cyavate na parām prāpnoti pāpīyān bhavati saṃvatsaram indraṃ yajeta saṃvatsaraṃ hi vrataṃ nāti svā |	One should not sacrifice to, Mahendra, if one is not prosperous. The prosperous are three; a learned (Brahman), a village headman, and a warrior. Their deity is Mahendra. He who sacrifices beyond his own deity loses his own deity, and does not obtain another, and becomes worse.

After the year he should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, lord of vows; verily for a year Agni, lord of vows, causes him to take up the vow who has slain his foe (vrtra). Thereafter he may sacrifice at will.
nāsomayājī saṃ nayed anāgataṃ vā etasya payo yo 'somayājī yad asomayājī saṃnayet parimoṣa eva so 'nṛtaṃ karoti |	No one who is not a Soma sacrificer should offer the Samnayya. For the milk of him who is not a Soma sacrificer is imperfect, and if one who is not a Soma sacrificer offers the Samnayya he is a thief and does wrong, and (his milk) is poured forth in vain.
atho paraiva sicyate somayājy eva saṃ nayet payo vai somaḥ payaḥ sāṃnāyyam payasaiva paya ātman dhatte vi vā etam prajayā paśubhir ardhayati vardhayaty asya bhrātṛvyaṃ yasya havir niruptam purastāc candramāḥ |	A Soma sacrificer only should offer the Samnayya. Soma is milk, the Samnayya is milk; verily with milk he places milk in himself. The moon deprives him of offspring and cattle, and makes his enemy wax great on whose sacrifice when offered it rises in the east [1].
abhy udeti tredhā taṇḍulān vi bhajet |	He should divide the rice grains into three parts;
ye madhyamāḥ syus tān agnaye dātre puroḍāśam aṣṭākapālaṃ kuryāt | ye sthaviṣṭhās tān indrāya pradātre dadhaṃś carum |	the mean size he should make into a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, the giver, the largest lie should give as a mess to Indra, the bestower, the smallest (he should give) as a mess in boiled (milk) to Visnu Çipivista.
ye 'ṇiṣṭhās tān viṣṇave śipiviṣṭāya śṛte carum agnir evāsmai prajām prajanayati vṛddhām indraḥ pra yachati yajño vai viṣṇuḥ paśavaḥ śipir yajña eva paśuṣu prati tiṣṭhati na dve |	Agni thus generates offspring for him; Indra gives it in crease; Visnu is the sacrifice, and Çipi cattle; verily on the sacrifice and cattle he rests. He should not offer twice [2].
yajeta yat pūrvayā samprati yajetottarayā chambaṭ kuryād yad uttarayā samprati yajeta pūrvayā chambaṭ kuryān neṣṭir bhavati na yajñas tad anu hrītamukhy apagalbho jāyate |	If he were to offer now with the first he would make a failure with the second; if with the second now, he would make a failure with the first; there is no offering at all and no sacrifice, for that cause a son is born shamefaced and retiring.
ekām eva yajeta pragalbho 'sya jāyate |	One offering only should one make; a valiant son is born to him.
anādṛtya tad dve eva yajeta yajñamukham eva pūrvayālabhate yajata uttarayā devatā eva pūrvayāvarunddha indriyam uttarayā devalokam eva |	One should disregard this and offer twice.

He offers to the kindlingsticks; verily he wins the dawns of the goddesses. He offers to Tanunapat; verily he wins the sacrifice [1].

He offers to the oblations; verily in cattle he finds support. He offers to the sacrificial strew; verily he finds support in the paths that lead to the gods.
etāvanto vai devalokās teṣv eva yathāpūrvam prati tiṣṭhati devāsurā eṣu lokeṣv aspardhanta te devāḥ prayājair ebhyo lokebhyo 'surān prāṇudanta tat prayājānām |	verily he finds support in the world of heaven. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily in them in order he finds support. The gods and the Asuras contended as to these worlds. The gods by the fore-sacrifices drove the Asuras away from these worlds;
prayājatvam |	that is why the fore-sacrifices [3] are so called.
yasyaivaṃ viduṣaḥ prayājā ijyante praibhyo lokebhyo bhrātṛvyān nudate |	He for whom knowing thus are offered the fore-sacrifices, drives his enemy away from these worlds.
abhikrāmaṃ juhoti |	He offers stepping near, for conquest.
abhijityai yo vai prayājānām mithunaṃ veda pra prajayā paśubhir mithunair jāyate samidho bahvīr iva yajati tanūnapātam ekam iva mithunaṃ tat |	He who knows the pairing of the fore sacrifices is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. He offers to the kindling-sticks as many, to Tanunapat as one, and that makes a pair.
iḍo bahvīr iva yajati barhir ekam iva mithunaṃ tat |	He offers to the kindling-sticks as many, to the sacrificial strew as one, and that makes a pair.
etad vai prayājānām mithunam |	That is the pairing of the fore-sacrifices.
ya evaṃ veda pra | prajayā paśubhir mithunair jāyate devānāṃ vā aniṣṭā devatā āsan |	He who knows thus [4] is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. These deities were not sacrificed to by the gods;

The gods divided the Gayatri, five syllables in front and three behind. Then the sacrifice was protected, and the sacrificer. In that the fore- and aftersacrifices are offered, protection is afforded to the sacrifice and to the sacrificer, for the overcoming of the enemy. Therefore a covering is larger in front and smaller behind.

They completed it with the cry of 'Hail!' in the fore-sacrifices. They split the sacrifice who complete it with the cry of 'Hail!' in the fore-sacrifices. Having offered the fore sacrifices he sprinkles the oblations, for the continuity of the sacrifice;
atho havir evākar atho yathāpūrvam upaiti pitā vai prayājāḥ prajānūyājās |	The fore-sacrifices are the father, the after-sacrifices the son;
yat prayājān iṣṭvā havīṃṣy abhighārayati pitaiva tat putreṇa sādhāraṇam |	in that having offered the fore-sacrifices he sprinkles the oblations, the father makes common property with the son [6].
kurute tasmād āhur yaś caivaṃ veda yaś ca na kathā putrasya kevalaṃ kathā sādhāraṇam pitur iti |	Therefore they say, who know it or who know not, 'How is it the son's only, how is the father's common?' That which spills when the fore-sacrifices are offered is not really spilt.

yad agnīṣomau |	Agni and Soma are the kings of the gods [1].
antarā devatā ijyete devatānāṃ vidhṛtyai tasmād rājñā manuṣyā vidhṛtās |	They are sacrificed to between the gods, to separate the gods. Therefore men are separated by the king.

When he has repeated a Rc, he makes an offering of the portion of the oblation with the jusana formula;
ṛcam anūcya haviṣa ṛcā yajati tenobhayatodato dādhāra mūrdhanvatī puro'nuvākyā bhavati mūrdhānam evainaṃ samānānāṃ karoti |	When he has repeated a Rc, he makes an offering of the sacrificial food (havis) with a Rc; by that means he supports those with incisors on both sides.

He offers with averse containing the word 'team' (niyut); verily he appropriates (ni-yu) the cattle of his enemy. Keçin Satyakami said to Keçin Darbhya, 'The seven-footed Çakvari I shall use for thee at the sacrifice to-morrow, by whose strength one defeats the enemies that have arisen and those that shall be, by the first half of whose strength the ox feeds, by the second half the cow.' The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily he defeats the enemies that have arisen;
upariṣṭāllakṣmā |	the Yajya is marked behind [3];
yājyā janiṣyamāṇān eva prati nudate purastāllakṣmā puro'nuvākyā bhavaty asminn eva loke jyotir dhatte |	verily he defeats the enemies that shall be. The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily he places light in this world;

Full of light become these worlds to him who knows thus. The Puronuvakya, is marked in front; therefore the ox feeds with the first half.
upariṣṭāllakṣmā yājyā tasmāj jaghanārdhena dhenus |	The Yajya is marked behind; therefore the cow feeds with the second half.
ya evaṃ veda bhuṅkta enam etau vajra ājyaṃ vajra ājyabhāgau |	Him who knows thus these two enjoy. The oblation is a bolt, the portions of the oblation are a bolt [4], the Vasat call is a bolt;

He utters the Vasat call in anger, to lay low his foe. The Puronuvakya is the Gayatri, the Yajya the Tristubh; verily he makes the ruling class dependent on the priestly class; therefore the Brahman is the chief.
mukhyo bhavati ya evaṃ veda praivainam puro'nuvākyayāha pra ṇayati yājyayā gamayati vaṣaṭkāreṇa |	The chief he becomes who knows thus. He proclaims him with the Puronuvakya, leads him forward with the Yajya, and makes him go with the Vasat call.
aivainam puro'nuvākyayā datte pra yachati yājyayā prati |	He takes him with the Puronuvakya, he gives him with the Yajya, and [5] establishes him with the Vasat call.

The Vasat call has two syllables, the sacrificer has two feet; verily afterwards he finds support in cattle. The Puronuvakya is the Gayatri, the Yajya, the Tristubh, and this is the sevenfooted Çakvari.

He said, 'Lot them offer to you the portions of the oblation, let them pour out (a layer), let them sprinkle (it).' Therefore they offer the portions of the oblation, they pour out (a layer), and sprinkle (it). The theologians say, 'For what reason are the other offerings worn out, but the oblation fresh?' He should reply, 'Because it is Prajapati's [1], for Prajapati is of the gods the fresh one.' The metres ran away from the gods (saying), 'We will not bear the offering, if we have no share.' They kept for them (the offering) divided into four parts, for the Puronuvakya, the Yajya, the deity, the Vasat call. In that he offers (the offering) in four parts, he delights the metres, and they delighted by him carry the offering to the gods.
aṅgiraso vā ita uttamāḥ suvargaṃ lokam āyan tad ṛṣayo yajñavāstv abhyavāyan te |	The Angirases were the last to go hence to the world of heaven. The Rsis came to the place of sacrifice;

They said to it, 'Be firm for Indra; be firm for Brhaspati: be firm for the All-gods.' It did not become firm. They said to it, 'Be firm for Agni.' It became firm for Agni. In that (the cake) for Agni on eight potsherds is unmoved at the full and at the new moon, (it serves) to conquer the world of heaven.

Therefore one should cook it, without burning it, for the gods.

uttaram barhiṣaḥ prastaraṃ sādayati prajāvai barhir yajamānaḥ prastaras |	He puts the bundle over the sacrificial strew, the strew is offspring, the bundle the sacrificer;
yajamānam evāyajamānād uttaraṃ karoti tasmād yajamāno 'yajamānād uttaras |	verily he makes the sacrificer superior to the non-sacrificer. Therefore the sacrificer is superior to the non-sacrificer.

dhruvāsītīmām abhi mṛśati |	(With the words), 'Thou art firm (dhruva)', he strokes it;

asyām eva prati tiṣṭhati na vepano bhavati |	verily he finds support in it, and shivers not.
agān agnīd ity āha yad brūyāt | agann agnir ity agnāv agniṃ gamayen nir yajamānaṃ suvargāl lokād bhajet |	'Has he gone, O Agnidh? he says. If (the Agnidh) were to say, 'Agni has gone?' he would make Agni go into the fire, and exclude the sacrificer from the world of heaven.

He said, 'Let me choose a boon; whatever of the offering when it is taken (in the ladle) falls outside the enclosing-sticks, let that be the share of my brothers.'

If a portion of the victim be lost, he should cut off an equivalent portion of the butter;
ye paśuṃ vimathnīran yas tān kāmayeta |	that is then the atonement.

Viçvamitra and Jamadagni had a quarrel with Vasistha. Jamadagni saw this Vihavya (hymn), and by means of it he appropriated the power and strength of Vasistha. In that the Vihavya is recited, the sacrificer appropriates the power and strength of his enemy. 'He who performs more rites of sacrifice', they say, 'appropriates the gods.' If the Soma (sacrifice) on the other side is an Agnistoma, he should perform an Ukthya;

When the Soma is pressed [2] the first drop which falls has potency to destroy the power, strength, offspring, and cattle of the sacrificer;
ā māskānt saha prajayā saha rāyas poṣeṇendriyam me vīryam mā nir vadhīs |	he should pronounce over it the formula, 'Thou hast fallen to me with offspring, with abundance of wealth; destroy not my power and strength';

The drop hath fallen on the earth, the sky, On this seat and on the one which was aforetime The drop that wandereth over the third seat offer in the seven Hotras.' He who bestows upon the gods the glory of the gods, and on men the glory of men, has the divine glory among the gods, the human glory among men.

Verily so he makes the libations of Soma to have a base.
iti saumyā eva tad āhutīr āyatanavatīḥ karoty āyatanavān bhavati ya evaṃ veda |	He becomes possessed of a base who knows thus.
atho dyāvāpṛthivī eva ghṛtena vy unatti te vyunatte upajīvānīye bhavata upavīvanīyo bhavati |	Verily also he wets with ghee the sky and earth: they being wet are to be lived upon;

Manu divided his property among his sons. He deprived Nabhanedistha, who was a student, of any portion. He went to him, and said, 'How hast thou deprived me of a portion?' He replied, 'I have not deprived you of a portion; the Angirases here are performing a Sattra;

He told them it, and they when going to the world of heaven gave him their cattle. Rudra approached him as he went about with his cattle in the place of sacrifice, and said, 'These are my cattle.' He replied, 'They have given them [5] to me.' They have not the power to do that', he replied, (whatever is left on the place of sacrifice is mine.' Then one should not resort to a place of sacrifice.
so 'bravīd yajñe mā bhajātha te paśūn nābhi maṃsya iti tasmā etam manthinaḥ saṃsrāvam ajuhot tato vai tasya rudraḥ paśūn nābhy amanyata yatraitam evaṃ vidvān manthinaḥ saṃsrāvaṃ juhoti na tatra rudraḥ paśūn abhi manyate |	He said, 'Give me a share in the sacrifice, and I will not have designs against your cattle. He poured out for him the remnants of the mixed (Soma). Then indeed had Rudra no designs against his cattle. When one who knows thus offers the remnants of the mixed (Soma), Rudra has no designs against his cattle.

'May the seven men live upon me', (with this hope) is the fire piled; three before, three behind, the self the seventh; so many live upon him in yonder world. Prajapati desired to pile the fire;

Therefore for a year must it be borne, then is he propagated. To him the Vasus said, 'Thou hast been propagated; let us be propagated.' He gave it to the Vasus, they bore it for three days, thereby [5] they created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for three days;

The theologians say, 'Should the fire be piled up with face down, or face upwards?' Now the fire is piled in the likeness of birds;
yan nyañcaṃ cinuyāt pṛṣṭita enam āhutaya ṛcheyus |	if he were to pile it face downward, the libations would reach it behind;
yad uttānaṃ na patituṃ śaknuyād asuvargyo 'sya syāt prācīnam uttānam |	if upwards, it could not fly, it would not be heavenly for him; he puts down the human head towards the east, face upwards [2];

bṛhaspatir no haviṣā vṛdhātu | ity āha brahma vai devānām bṛhaspatis |	'May Brhaspati rejoice in our oblation' [3], he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods;
brahmaṇaivāsmai yajñam ava runddhe yad brūyāt | vidher iti yajñasthāṇum ṛchet |	verily by the holy power he wins this sacrifice for him. If he were to say vidheh then he would stumble on the sacrificial post;

He offers with a full (verse) to win Prajapati; full as it were is Prajapati. He offers with a defective (verse), for the creation of offspring, for from what is defective Prajapati created offspring.
ṛksāme vai devebhyo yajñāyātiṣṭhamāne kṛṣṇo rūpaṃ kṛtvāpakramyātiṣṭhatām |	The Rc and the Saman, unwilling to remain with the gods for the sacrifice, taking the form of a black antelope departed and remained away.

They called to them, and they depositing their might in day and night came up to them. This is the colour of the Rc, the white of the skin of the black antelope; the black is the colour of the Saman. 'Ye are images of the Rc and Saman', he says;
ṛksāme evāva rundhe | eṣaḥ |	verily he wins the Rc and the Saman [1].

Whatever is imbued in those two, he wins. He consecrates (him) with a black antelope skin. The black antelope skin is the form of the holy power; verily he consecrates him with the holy power.
imāṃ dhiyaṃ śikṣamāṇasya devety āha yathāyajur evaitat |	'O god, this prayer of him who imploreth', he says. That is according to the text.
garbho vā eṣa yad dīkṣita ulbaṃ vāsaḥ prorṇute tasmāt |	be covers. Therefore [2] foetuses are born covered (with the caul).

He uncovers when the Soma has been purchased; verily he is born. It is also as when one uncovers to a superior. The Angirases going to the world of heaven divided their strength.
mekhalā bhavaty ūrjam evāva runddhe madhyataḥ saṃ nahyati madhyata evāsmā ūrjaṃ dadhāti tasmān madhyata ūrjā bhuñjate |	Çara grass is strength. In that the girdle is of Çara grass [3], he wins strength. He girds it in the middle; verily he gives him strength in the middle.

In that the girdle is of Çara grass, he clearly drives away the enemy hunger from the middle (of man's body). It is threefold. The breath is threefold; verily he places the threefold breath in the middle of the sacrificer.

The sacrifice reflected on the gift (to the priests). He had intercourse with her. Indra perceived this and reflected, 'He who will be born from this union will be this world.' He entered her; from her verily was Indra born;
tāṃ haste ny aveṣṭayata tām mṛgeṣu ny adadhāt sā kṛṣṇaviṣāṇābhavad indrasya yonir asi mā mā hiṃsīr iti kṛṣṇaviṣāṇām pra yachati sayonim eva yajñaṃ karoti sayoniṃ dakṣiṇāṃ sayonim indraṃ sayonitvāya kṛṣyai tvā susasyāyā ity āha tasmād akṛṣṭapacyā oṣadhayaḥ pacyante supippalābhyas tvauṣadhībhya ity āha tasmād oṣadhayaḥ phalaṃ gṛhṇanti yad dhastena |	Stroking her womb he split it, she became barren after birth, and that is the origin of the (cow) which is barren after birth [6]. He wrapped it (the yoni) in his hand, he deposited it among the wild beasts, it became the horn of the black antelope. 'Thou art the birthplace of Indra; harm me not', (with these words) he hands the horn of the black antelope. Verily he makes the sacrifice united with the womb, the gift with the womb, Indra with the womb, for union with the womb.

He scratches himself with the horn of the black antelope and smiles, holding it for the protection of his offspring. He should not let go the horn of the black antelope before the bringing of the gifts (to the priests). If he were to let go the horn of the black antelope before the bringing of the gifts, the womb of his offspring will be liable to miscarriage.
nītāsu dakṣiṇāsu cātvāle kṛṣṇaviṣāṇām prāsyati yonir vai yajñasya cātvālaṃ yoniḥ kṛṣṇaviṣāṇā yonāv eva yoniṃ dadhāti yajñasya sayonitvāya |	When the gifts have been brought, he casts away the horn of the black antelope in the pit. The pit is the womb of the sacrificer; the horn of the black antelope is the womb; verily he places womb in womb, that the sacrificer may have a womb.

For the Maitravaruna first assigns to the priests their utterance, and the priests plant it in the sacrificer. 'Hail! with my mind the sacrifice', he says; for man approaches the sacrifice with his mind.
vāva yaḥ pavate sa yajñas tam eva sākṣād ā rabhate muṣṭī karoti vācaṃ yachati yajñasya dhṛtyai |	for the sacrifice is in the atmosphere. 'Hail! from the wind the sacrifice I grasp', he says [2]. The sacrifice is he who blows here;

Thrice aloud (he says it); verily he proclaims him to both gods and men. He should not utter speech until the Naksatras appear.
yat purā nakṣatrebhyo vācaṃ visṛjed yajñaṃ vi chindyāt |	If he were to utter speech before the Naksatras appear, he would divide the sacrifice [3].

The consecrated is bound by a vow of sacrifice; verily with regard to the sacrifice does he utter speech. Should he utter speech, he should then repeat a Rc addressed to Visnu. Visnu is the sacrifice; verily he unites the sacrifice with the sacrifice.

The man who is consecrated is the oblation, and if he were to sacrifice he would offer a part of the sacrificer; if he were not to sacrifice, then he would omit a joint of the sacrifice. 'The gods, mind born, mind using', he says. The gods, mind born, mind using, are the breaths; verily in them he sacrifices secretly, and the sacrifice is both offered as it were and yet not offered.
svapantaṃ vai dīkṣitaṃ rakṣāṃsi jighāṃsanty agniḥ |	Agni [5] indeed is the slayer of the Raksases. 'O Agni, be thou wakeful.
khalu vai rakṣohāgne tvaṃ su jāgṛhi vayaṃ su mandiṣīmahīty āhāgnim evādhipāṃ kṛtvā svapiti rakṣasām apahatyai |	Let us be glad', he says; verily having made Agni his guardian, for the smiting away of the Raksases, he sleeps.
avratyam iva vā eṣa karoti yo dīkṣitaḥ svapiti tvam agne vratapā asīty āhāgnir vai devānāṃ vratapatiḥ sa evainaṃ vratam ālambhayati deva ā martyeṣv ety āha devaḥ |	Now, if a man who is consecrated sleeps, he does something that as it were is contrary to his vow. I Thou, O Agni, art the guardian of vows', he says. Agni indeed is among the gods the guardian of vows; verily he causes him to take up his vow again.
hy eṣa san martyeṣu tvaṃ yajñeṣv īḍya ity āhaitaṃ hi yajñeṣv īḍate |	'Thou art to be invoked at our sacrifices', he says; for him they invoke at the sacrifices.
apa vai dīkṣitāt suṣupuṣa indriyaṃ devatāḥ krāmanti viśve devā abhi mām āvavṛtrann ity āha |	Now power and the gods depart from the man who is consecrated when he is asleep. 'All the gods have surrounded me', he says;
indriyeṇaivainaṃ devatābhiḥ saṃ nayati yad etad yajur na brūyād yāvata eva paśūn abhi dīkṣeta tāvanto 'sya paśavaḥ syū rāsveyat |	verily he unites him with both power and the gods. If he were not to utter that formula (Yajus), so many cattle would be as he might consecrate himself for.
somā bhūyo bharety āhāparimitān eva paśūn ava runddhe candram asi mama bhogāya bhavety āha yathādevatam evaināḥ prati gṛhṇāti vāyave tvā varuṇāya tveti yad evam etā nānudiśed ayathā devataṃ dakṣiṇā gamayed ā devatābhyo vṛścyeta yad evam etā anudiśati yathādevatam eva dakṣiṇā gamayati na devatābhya ā vṛścyate devīr āpo apāṃ napād ity āha yad vo medhyaṃ yajñiyaṃ sadevaṃ tad vo māva kramiṣam iti vāvaitad āha |	verily he takes each according to its deity. He says, 'To Vayu thee, to Varuna thee!' If he did not so specify them, he would put the gifts out of correspondence with the deities, and would be brought low to the deities. Because he thus specifies them, he puts the gifts in correspondence with the deities, and is not brought low to the deities. 'O divine waters, son of the waters', he says. 'That divine part of yours, which is pure and fit for the sacrifice, may I not step upon', that he says in effect.
achinnaṃ tantum pṛthivyā anu geṣam ity āha setum eva kṛtvāty eti |	'The unbroken web of earth may follow', he says; verily making a bridge he crosses over.
devā vai devayajanam adhyavasāya diśo na prājānan te 'nyo'nyam upādhāvan tvayā pra jānāma tvayeti tedityāṃ sam adhriyanta tvayā pra jānāmeti sābravīd varaṃ vṛṇai matprāyaṇā eva vo yajñā madudayanā asann iti tasmād ādityaḥ prāyaṇīyo yajñānām āditya udayanīyaḥ pañca devatā yajati pañca diśo diśām prajñātyai |	The gods, having fixed up a place of sacrifice, could not distinguish the quarters. They ran up to one another, (saying) 'By thee shall we distinguish them, by thee.' They fixed upon Aditi, (saying, 'By thee shall we distinguish them.' She said, 'Let me choose a guerdon. Let the opening oblation in the sacrifice be mine, and the concluding oblation be mine.' Therefore the opening oblation of the sacrifice belongs to Aditi, and the concluding oblation belongs to Aditi. He offers to five gods;
atho pañcākṣarā paṅktiḥ pāṅkto yajño yajñam evāva runddhe pathyāṃ svastim ayajan prācīm eva tayā diśam prājānann agninā dakṣiṇā somena pratīcīṃ savitrodīcīm adityordhvām pathyāṃ svastiṃ yajati prācīm eva tayā diśam pra jānāti pathyāṃ svastim iṣṭvāgnīṣomau yajati cakṣuṣī vā ete yajñasya yad agnīṣomau tābhyām evānu paśyati |	Now the Pankti is of five elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. They made sacrifice to Pathya Svasti. The eastern quarter they distinguished by her, by Agni the southern, by Soma the western, by Savitr the northern, by Aditi the zenith. He offers to Pathya Svasti;
agnīṣomāv iṣṭvā savitāraṃ yajati savitṛprasūta evānu paśyati savitāram iṣṭvāditiṃ yajatīyaṃ vā aditir asyām eva pratiṣṭhāyānu paśyati |	Agni and Soma indeed are the eyes of the sacrificer; verily he sees with them [2]. Having offered to Agni and Soma, he offers to Savitr; verily on the instigation of Savitr he sees. Having offered to Savitr, he offers to Aditi;
aditim iṣṭvā mārutīm ṛcam anvāha viśāṃ klptyai brahmavādino vadanti prayājavad ananūyājam prāyaṇīyaṃ kāryam anūyājavat |	verily taking his stand on it he sees. Having offered to Aditi, he repeats the verse to the Maruts. The Maruts are the subjects of the gods.
aprayājam udayanīyam iti |	This is not to be followed.
ime vai prayājā amī anūyājāḥ saiva sā yajñasya saṃtatis tat tathā na kāryam ātmā vai prayājāḥ prajānūyājā yat prayājān antariyād ātmānam antar iyād yad anūyājān antariyāt prajām antar iyād yataḥ khalu vai yajñasya vitatasya na kriyate tad anu yajñaḥ parā bhavati yajñam parābhavantaṃ yajamāno 'nu |	The foreofferings are the self; the after-offerings the offspring. If he were to omit the fore-offerings, he would omit the self; if he were to omits the after-offerings, he would omit offspring. In so far as the whole of the sacrifice is not performed, in so far does the sacrifice come to ruin, and the sacrificer comes to ruin along with the sacrifice [4].
parā bhavati prayājavad evānūyājavat prāyaṇīyaṃ kāryam prayājavad anūyājavad udayanīyaṃ nātmānam antareti na prajāṃ na yajñaḥ parābhavati na yajamānaḥ prāyaṇīyasya niṣkāsa udayanīyam abhi nir vapati saiva sā yajñasya saṃtatis |	Verily the opening oblation should be performed with both fore- and after-offerings, and the concluding oblation should be performed both with fore- and after offerings. He does not omit the self, nor offspring; the sacrifice does not come to ruin, nor the sacrificer. He offers the concluding oblation in the scrapings of the opening oblation;
yāḥ prāyaṇīyasya yājyā yat tā udayanīyasya yājyāḥ kuryāt parāṅ amuṃ lokam ā rohet pramāyukaḥ syāt | yāḥ prāyaṇīyasya puro'nuvākyās tā udayanīyasya yājyāḥ karoty asminn eva loke prati tiṣṭhati |	Now if he were to make the Yajya verses of the opening libation the Yajya verses of the concluding libation, he would mount to the other world away from this, and would be liable to die. The Puronuvakya verses of the opening libation should be made the Yajya verses of the concluding libation; verily he finds support in this world.
kadrūś ca vai suparṇī cātmarūpayor aspardhetām |	Kadru and Suparni had a dispute (for the stake of) each other's form.
sā kadrūḥ suparṇīm ajayat sābravīt tṛtīyasyām ito divi somas tam ā hara tenātmānaṃ niṣkrīṇīṣveti | iyaṃ vai kadrūr asau suparṇī chandāṃsi sauparṇeyāḥ sābravīt |	Kadru defeated Suparni. She said, 'In the third heaven from here is the Soma; fetch it, and by it buy your release.' Kadru is this (earth), Suparni yonder (heaven), the descendants of Suparni the metres.
asmai vai pitarau putrān bibhritas tṛtīyasyām ito divi somas tam ā hara tenātmānaṃ niṣ krīṇīṣva |	She said, 'For this do parents rear children; "in the third heaven from here is the Soma;
iti mā kadrūr avocad iti jagaty ud apatac caturdaśākṣarā satī sāprāpya ny avartata tasyai dve akṣare amīyetām |	fetch it, and by it buy your release" [1], so has Kadru said to me.' The Jagati flew up, of fourteen syllables, but returned without obtaining it;
sā paśubhiś ca dīkṣayā cāgachat tasmāj jagatī chandasām paśavyatamā tasmāt paśumantaṃ dīkṣopa namati triṣṭug ud apatat trayodaśākṣarā satī sāprāpya ny avartata tasyai dve akṣare amīyetām |	it lost two syllables, but returned with the (sacrificial) animals and consecration. Therefore the Jagati is the richest in cattle of the metres, and consecration waits upon a man who is rich in cattle. The Tristubh flew up, of thirteen syllables, but returned without obtaining it;
sā dakṣiṇābhiś ca |	it lost two syllables, but returned with the (sacrificial) gifts [2] and penance.
tapasā cāgachat tasmāt triṣṭubho loke mādhyaṃdine savane dakṣiṇā nīyante |	Therefore in the world of the Tristubh, the midday oblation, the gifts are brought.
etat khalu vāva tapa ity āhur yaḥ svaṃ dadātīti gāyatry ud apatac caturakṣarā saty ajayā jyotiṣā tam asyā ajābhy arunddha tad ajāyā ajatvam |	'That in truth is penance', they say, 'if a man gives his wealth.' The Gayatri flew up, of four syllables, together with a female goat with light. Then the goat won (Soma) for her, and so the goat has the name.
sā somaṃ cāharac catvāri cākṣarāṇi sāṣṭākṣarā sam apadyata brahmavādino vadanti |	The Gayatri brought back the Soma and the four syllables, and so became of eight syllables.
kasmāt satyād {F gāyatrī}{W gāyatrī}{GLOS gāyatrī} kaniṣṭhā chandasāṃ satī yajñamukham parīyāyeti yad evādaḥ somam āharat tasmād yajñamukham pary ait tasmāt tejasvinītamā padbhyāṃ dve savane samagṛhṇān mukhenaikam |	The theologians say [3], 'For what reason is it that the Gayatri, the smallest of the metres, holds the forefront of the sacrifice?' Because it brought down the Soma, it held the forefront of the sacrifice; therefore it is the most glorious (of the metres). By the feet it grasped two of the oblations, and by the mouth one.
yam mukhena samagṛhṇāt tad adhayat tasmād dve savane śukravatī prātaḥsavanaṃ ca mādhyaṃdinaṃ ca tasmāt tṛtīyasavana ṛjīṣam abhi ṣuṇvanti dhītam iva hi manyante |	The one it grasped by the mouth it sucked; therefore two oblations are made of the pure Soma, the morning and midday oblations; therefore at the third oblation they pour out the dregs of the Soma; for they regard it as sucked as it were [4].
āśiram ava nayati saśukratvāyātho sam bharaty evainat taṃ somam āhriyamāṇaṃ gandharvo viśvāvasuḥ pary amuṣṇāt sa tisro rātrīḥ parimuṣito 'vasat tasmāt tisro rātrīḥ krītaḥ somo vasati te devā abruvan |	verily also he makes ready it (the rjisa). When the Soma was being borne away, the Gandharva Viçvavasu stole it. It was for three nights stolen; therefore after purchase the Soma is kept for three nights. The gods said, 'The Gandharvas love women;
strīkāmā vai gandharvā striyā niṣ krīṇāmeti te vācaṃ striyam ekahāyanīṃ kṛtvā tayā nir akrīṇan |	let us redeem it with a woman.' They made speech unto a woman of one year old, and with her redeemed it.
sā rohid rūpaṃ kṛtvā gandharvebhyaḥ |	She adopted the form of a deer and ran away from the Gandharvas [5] that was the origin of the deer.
apakramyātiṣṭhat tad rohito janma te devā abruvan |	The gods said, 'She has run from you;
apa yuṣmad akramīn nāsmān upāvartate vi hvayāmahā iti brahma gandharvā avadann agāyan devāḥ sā devān gāyata upāvartata tasmād gāyantaṃ striyaḥ kāmayante kāmukā enaṃ striyo bhavanti ya evaṃ vedātho ya evaṃ vidvān api janyeṣu bhavati tebhya eva dadaty uta yad bahutayāḥ |	let us both summon her.' The Gandharvas uttered a spell, the gods sang, she went to the gods as they sang. Therefore women love one who sings; enamoured are women of him who thus knows. So if there is in a family one person who knows thus, men give their daughters in wedlock to that family, even if there be other (wooers) in plenty [6].
bhavanti |	He buys Soma with a (cow) one year old;
ekahāyanyā krīṇāti vācaivainaṃ sarvayā krīṇāti tasmād ekahāyanā manuṣyā vācaṃ vadanti |	verily he buys it with the whole of speech. Therefore men utter speech when one year old.
akūṭayākarṇayākaṇayāśloṇayāsaptaśaphayā krīṇāti sarvayaivainaṃ krīṇāti yac chvetayā krīṇīyād duścarmā yajamānaḥ syāt |	He buys with a cow which has no horns, small ears, is not one-eyed or lame, and has not seven hooves; verily he buys it with all. If he were to buy it with a white cow, the sacrificer would become leprous.
yat kṛṣṇayānustaraṇī syāt pramāyuko yajamānaḥ syāt |	If he were to buy with a black one, it would be a funeral cow, and the sacrificer would be likely to die.
yad dvirūpayā vātraghnī syāt sa vānyaṃ jinīyāt taṃ vānyo jinīyāt |	If with one of both colours, it would be one sacred to Vrtrahan, and he would either overcome his foe or his foe him.
aruṇayā piṅgākṣyā krīṇāti |	He buys with a ruddy, yellow-eyed one.
etad vai somasya rūpam |	This is the form of Soma;
svayaivainaṃ devatayā krīṇāti |	verily he buys it with its own deity.
tad dhiraṇyam abhavat tasmād adbhyo hiraṇyam punanti brahmavādino vadanti kasmāt satyād anasthikena prajāḥ pravīyante 'sthanvatīr jāyanta iti yad dhiraṇyaṃ ghṛte 'vadhāya juhoti tasmād anasthikena prajāḥ pra vīyante 'sthanvatīr jāyante |	Therefore they purify gold forth from the waters. The theologians say, 'How is it that offspring are produced through that which is boneless, and yet are born with bones?' Because he offers the gold, placing it in the ghee, therefore are offspring produced, through that which is boneless, and yet are born with bones.
etad vā agneḥ priyaṃ dhāma yad ghṛtaṃ tejo hiraṇyam iyaṃ te śukra tanūr idaṃ varca ity āha satejasam evainaṃ satanum |	The ghee is Agni's loved abode, the gold, is radiance. 'This is thy body, O pure one. This is thy splendour', he says; verily he unites Agni with his radiance and his body [1];
karoti | atho sam bharaty evainam |	verily also he makes him ready.
yad abaddham avadadhyād garbhāḥ prajānām parāpātukāḥ syus |	If he were to deposit (the gold) without fastening it on, then the foetuses of offspring would be liable to miscarriage.

He fastens it so that it cannot be untied, for the production of offspring. The cow with which the Soma is bought is speech. 'Thou art the strong', he says; for what he strengthens in his mind, that he expresses in speech.
yajño vai viṣṇus |	Visnu is the sacrifice;
yajñāyaivaināṃ juṣṭāṃ karoti tasyās te satyasavasaḥ prasava ity āha savitṛprasūtām eva vācam ava runddhe kāṇḍekāṇḍe vai kriyamāṇe yajñaṃ rakṣāṃsi jighāṃsanti |	verily be makes her accept able to the sacrifice. 'Through the impulse of thee, of true impulse', he says; verily he wins speech which is impelled by Savitr. As each part is performed, the Raksases are fain to injure the sacrifice;
eṣa khalu vā arakṣohataḥ panthā yo 'gneś ca sūryasya ca sūryasya cakṣur āruham agner akṣṇaḥ kanīnikām ity āha ya evārakṣohataḥ panthās taṃ samārohati vāg vā eṣā yat somakrayaṇī cid asi manāsīty āha śāsty evainām etat tasmāc chiṣṭāḥ prajā jāyante cid asīty āha yad dhi manasā cetayate tad vācā vadati manāsīty āha yad dhi manasābhigachati tat karoti dhīr asīty āha yad dhi manasā dhyāyati tad vācā |	the path of Agni and Surya is one which the Raksases cannot injure. 'I have mounted the eye of the sun, the pupil of the eye of Agni', he says. He mounts the path which is not injured by the Raksases [3]. The cow with which the Soma is bought is speech. 'Thou art thought, thou art mind', he says;
vadati dakṣiṇāsīty āha dakṣiṇā hy eṣā yajñiyāsīty āha yajñiyām evaināṃ karoti kṣatriyāsīty āha kṣatriyā hy eṣā |	'Thou art the gift (to the priests)', he says; for (the cow) is the gift. 'Thou art of the sacrifice', he says; verily he makes her fit for the sacrifice. 'Thou art of kingly power', he says, for she is of kingly power.
aditir asy ubhayataḥśīrṣṇīty āha yad evādityaḥ prāyaṇīyo yajñānām āditya udayanīyas tasmād evam āha yad abaddhā syād ayatā syāt |	'Thou art Aditi, double-headed', he says. In that to Aditi belong the opening and the concluding oblations of the sacrifices, therefore does he say that. If (the cow) were not bound, she would be unrestrained;
yat padibaddhānustaraṇī syāt pramāyuko yajamānaḥ syāt | yat karṇagṛhītā vārtraghnī syāt sa vānyaṃ jinīyāt taṃ vānyo jinīyāt |	if she were bound by the foot, she would be the funeral cow, and the sacrificer would be likely to perish [5]. If she were held by the ears, she would belong to Vrtrahan, and the sacrificer would oppress another, or another would oppress him.
mitras tvā padi badhnātv ity āha mitro vai śivo devānām |	'May Mitra bind thee by the foot', he says. Mitra is the auspicious one of the gods;
tenaivainām padi badhnāti pūṣādhvanaḥ pātv ity āha |	verily with his help he binds her by the foot. 'May Pusan guard the ways', he says.
iyaṃ vai pūṣā |	Pusan is this (earth);
imām evāsyā adhipām akar | samaṣṭyai |	verily he makes her lady of this (earth), for the gaining thereof.
indrāyādhyakṣāyety āha |	'For Indra the guardian!' he says;
indram evāsyā adhyakṣaṃ karoti |	verily he makes Indra her guardian [6].
anu tvā mātā manyatām anu pitety āha |	'May thy mother approve, thy father', he says;
anumatayaivainayā krīṇāti sā devi devam achehīty āha devī hy eṣā devaḥ somas |	verily he buys with her approved. 'Go, goddess, to the god', he says; for she is a goddess, and Soma is a god.
indrāya somam ity āha |	'To Indra Soma', he says;
indrāya hi soma āhriyate yad etad yajur na brūyāt parācy eva somakrayaṇīyāt |	for the Soma is borne to Indra. If he were not to say that text, the cow with which the Soma is bought would go away.
rudras tvā vartayatv ity āha rudro vai krūraḥ | devānām |	'May Rudra guide thee hither', he says. Rudra is the harsh [7] one of the gods;

'In the path of Mitra', he says, for soothing. He buys indeed by speech when he buys by the cow with which the Soma is bought. Hail! Return with Soma as thy comrade, with wealth', he says, verily having purchased by means of speech, he restores speech to himself.
anupadāsukāsya vāg bhavati ya evaṃ veda |	The speech of him who knows thus is not likely to fail.
ṣaṭ padāny anu ni krāmati ṣaḍahaṃ vāṅ nāti vadati |	He follows six steps. Speech does not speak beyond the sixth day.

He offers in the seventh footprint. The Çakvari has seven feet, the Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. There are seven domesticated animals, and seven wild;
ubhayasyāvaruddhyai vasvy asi rudrāsīty āha rūpam evāsyā etan mahimānam |	'Thou art a Vasvi, thou art a Rudra', he says; verily thus by her form he expounds her greatness [1].
vyācaṣṭe bṛhaspatis tvā sumne raṇvatv ity āha brahma vai devānām bṛhaspatis |	'May Brhaspati make thee rejoice in happiness', he says. Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods;
brahmaṇaivāsmai paśūn ava runddhe rudro vasubhir ā ciketv ity āha |	'May Rudra with the Vasus be favourable to thee', he says, for the sake of protection.
āvṛttyai pṛthivyās tvā mūrdhann ā jigharmi devayajana ity āha pṛthivyā hy eṣa mūrdhā yad devayajanam iḍāyāḥ pada ity āha |	'I pour thee on the head of the earth, on the place of sacrifice', he says; for the place of sacrifice is the head of the earth. 'On the abode of the offering', he says;
iḍāyai hy etat padaṃ yat somakrayaṇyai ghṛtavati svāhā |	for the foot of the cow by which the Soma is bought is the abode of the offering.

If the Adhvaryu were to offer a libation where there were no fire, the Adhvaryu would become blind, and the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice. He offers after putting down the gold; verily he offers in that which has fire, the Adhvaryu does not become blind, and the Raksases. do not destroy the sacrifice.
idam ahaṃ rakṣaso grīvā api kṛntāmi yo 'smān dveṣṭi yaṃ ca vayaṃ dviṣma ity āha dvau vāva puruṣau yaṃ caiva dveṣṭi yaś cainaṃ dveṣṭi tayor evānantarāyaṃ grīvāḥ kṛntati paśavo vai somakrayaṇyai padam |	As each part is performed, the Raksases are fain to injure the sacrifice. 'The Raksas is enclosed, the evil spirits are enclosed', he says, for the smiting away of the Raksases [3]. 'Thus I cut the necks of the Raksas'; 'Who hateth us and whom we hate', he says. There are two persons, one whom he hates and one who hates him;
yāvattmūtaṃ saṃ vapati paśūn evāva runddhe |	he pours (the dust of the footprint) so far as it is mixed with the ghee;
asme rāya iti saṃ vapati |	(Saying) 'Ours be wealth', he pours it;
ātmānam evādhvaryuḥ |	verily the Adhvaryu [4] does not deprive himself of cattle.
paśubhyo nāntar eti tve rāya iti yajamānāya pra yachati yajamāna eva rayiṃ dadhāti tote rāya iti patniyai |	Saying 'Thine be wealth', he hands it to the sacrificer, and so bestows wealth on the sacrificer. Saying 'Thine be wealth', (the sacrificer hands it) to his wife.
ardho vā eṣa ātmano yat patnī yathā gṛheṣu nidhatte tādṛg eva tat tvaṣṭīmatī te sapeyety āha tvaṣṭā vai paśūnām mithunānāṃ rūpakṛt |	For a wife is the half of oneself, and to do so is as it were to deposit it in one's house. 'Let me attend on thee with Tvastr's aid', he says. Tvastr is the maker of the forms of offspring, of pairings;
rūpam eva paśuṣu dadhāti |	verily he places form in cattle.
asmai vai lokāya gārhapatya ā dhīyate 'muṣmā āhavanīyas |	For this world the Garhapatya fire is piled up; for yonder world the Ahavaniya.
yad gārhapatya upavaped asmiM loke paśumānt syāt |	If he were to cast it on-the Garhapatya fire, he would be rich in cattle in this world;

ubhayor evainaṃ lokayoḥ paśumantaṃ karoti |	verily he makes him rich in cattle in both worlds.
brahmavādino vadanti vicityaḥ somā na vicityā iti somo vā oṣadhīnāṃ rājā tasmin yad āpannaṃ grasitam evāsya tat |	The theologians say, 'Should the Soma be clarified or not?' Soma indeed is the king of plants; whatever falls upon it is swallowed by it.
yad vicinuyād yathāsyād grasitaṃ niṣkhidati tādṛg eva tat |	If be were to clarify it, it would be as when one expels from the mouth what has been swallowed;
yan na vicinuyād yathākṣann āpannaṃ vidhāvati tādṛg eva tat kṣodhulo 'dhvaryuḥ syāt kṣodhuko yajamānaḥ somavikrayint somaṃ śodhayety eva brūyāt |	if he were not to clarify it, it would be as when something falls upon the eye and moves to and fro; the Adhvaryu would be hungry, the sacrificer would be hungry. 'O Soma-seller, purify the Soma', he should say;
yadītaram |	so whether it be the one [1] or the other '.
yadītaram ubhayenaiva somavikrayiṇam arpayati tasmāt somavikrayī kṣodhukas |	he involves the Soma-seller in both (faults), and therefore the Soma-seller is hungry.
aruṇo ha smāhaupaveśiḥ somakrayaṇa evāhaṃ tṛtīyasavanam ava rundha iti paśūnāṃ carman mimīte paśūn evāva runddhe paśavo hi tṛtīyaṃ savanam |	Aruna Aupaveçi said, 'At the buying of the Soma I win the third pressing.' He measures (the Soma) on the skin of beasts verily he wins cattle, for cattle are the third pressing.
yaṃ kāmayeta | apaśuḥ syād ity ṛkṣatas tasya mimīta |	If he desire of a man, 'May he be without cattle', he should measure it for him on the rough side.
ṛkṣaṃ vā apaśavyam apaśur eva bhavati yaṃ kāmayeta paśumānt syāt | iti lomatas tasya mimīta |	verily he becomes without cattle. If he desire of a man, 'May he be rich in cattle' [2], he should measure for him on the hairy side.
etad vai paśūnāṃ rūpam |	That indeed is the form of cattle;
rūpeṇaivāsmai paśūn ava runddhe paśumān eva bhavati |	verily by the form he obtains cattle for him; verily he becomes rich in cattle.
apām ante krīṇāti sarasam evainaṃ krīṇāti |	He buys it at the end of the waters; verily he buys it with its sap.
amātyo 'sīty āha |	'Thou art a home dweller', he says;
amaivainaṃ kurute śukras te graha ity āha śukro hy asya grahas |	'Thy libation is bright', he says; for bright is its libation.

navakapālaḥ puroḍāśo bhavati te trayas trikapālās trivṛtā stomena sammitās tejas trivṛt teja eva yajñasya śīrṣan dadhāti navakapālaḥ puroḍāśo bhavati te trayas trikapālās trivṛtā prāṇena sammitās trvṛd vai |	The sacrificial cake is offered on nine potsherds.

In that having kindled fire he places it on the fire, by that verily is hospitality offered to Agni.
atho khalv āhur agniḥ sarvā devatā iti yad dhavir āsādyāgnim manthati havyāyaivāsannāya sarvā devatā janayati |	Or rather they say, 'Agni is all the gods.' In that he kindles fire after placing the oblation, he thus produces all the gods for the oblation when it has been placed.

The gods fell out among themselves.

Therefore of those who perform the Tanunaptra rite he who first is hostile goes to destruction. In that he divides up the Tanunaptra, (it serves) for the overcoming of the foe; he himself prospers, his foe is defeated. He divides five times; for five times did they divide.

ghṛtaṃ vai devā vajraṃ kṛtvā somam aghnan |	The gods making the ghee a weapon smote Soma;
antikam iva khalu vā asyaitac caranti yat tānūnaptreṇa pracaranti |	now they come near the Soma as it were, when they perform the Tanunaptra.

ity āha |	verily he invokes this blessing (on himself).
āśiṣaṃ evaitām ā śāste pra vā ete 'smāl lokāc cyavante ye somam āpyāyayanti | antarikṣadevatyo hi soma āpyāyitas |	Those who make the Soma to swell fall away from this world, for the Soma when made to swell has the atmosphere as its deity.

The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods in fear entered Agni;
agniḥ sarvā devatā iti te |	therefore they say, 'Agni is all the gods'.
agnim eva varūthaṃ kṛtvāsurān abhy abhavan |	They [6], making Agni their protection, overcame the Asuras.
agnim iva khalu vā eṣa pra viśati yo 'vāntaradīkṣām upaiti bhrātṛvyābhibhūtyai bhavaty ātmanā parāsya bhrātṛvyo bhavati |	Now he as it were enters Agni who undergoes the intermediate consecration, (and it serves) for the overcoming of his foes; he prospers himself, his foe is overcome.

He drinks warm milk, and rubs himself with bubbling water; for fire is extinguished by cold, (and these serve) for kindling. 'Thy dread form, O Agni', he says; verily with its own deity he consumes the hot milk, for unity, for atonement.
teṣām asurāṇāṃ tisraḥ pura āsann ayasmayy avamātha rajatātha hariṇī tā devā jetuṃ nāśaknuvan tā upasadaivājigīṣan tasmād āhur yaś caivaṃ veda yaś ca na |	The Asuras had three citadels; the lowest was of iron, then there was one of silver, then one of gold. The gods could not conquer them; they sought to conquer them by siege;
upasadā vai mahāpuraṃ jayantīti ta iṣuṃ sam askurvatāgnim anīkaṃ somaṃ śalyaṃ viṣṇuṃ tejanam |	therefore they say--both those who know thus and those who do not--'By siege they conquer great citadels.' They made ready an arrow, Agni as the point, Soma as the socket, Visnu as the shaft.

Therefore is Rudra overlord of animals. Rudra let it go; it cleft the three citadels and drove the Asuras away from these worlds. The observance of the Upasads is for the driving away of foes. One should not offer another libation in front;

Now the gods by the Upasads which they performed in the morning drove away the Asuras from the day, by the Upasads (performed) in the evening (they drove away the Asuras) from the night. In that both morning and evening Upasads [3] are performed, the sacrificer drives away his foes from day and night. The Yajyas used in the morning should be made Puronuvakyas at night, for variety. He performs three Upasads, these worlds are three;
yat sāyamprātar upasadaḥ |	verily he delights the seasons.

He should perform an intermediate consecration broader at the top than below who wishes, 'May there be prosperity for me in yonder world', (that is) four to begin with, then three, then two, then one;

They go to the world of heaven who perform the Upasads. Of them he who takes out (a little food) is left behind; one must take out carefully, (thinking) 'I have not taken out anything.' He who is left behind wearied among those who go on their own mission sticks behind and lives at (home).

The sacrifice went away from the gods in the form of Visnu, and entered the earth. The gods sought him grasping hands. Indra passed over him.
ahaṃ durge hantety atha kas tvam iti | ahaṃ durgād āharteti so 'bravīt | durge vai hantāvocathā varāho 'yaṃ vāmamoṣaḥ |	He said, 'Who has passed over me?' 'I am he who smites in the stronghold; who art thou?' 'I am he who brings from the stronghold.' He said, 'Thou art called he who smites in the stronghold.
saptānāṃ girīṇām parastād vittaṃ vedyam asurāṇām bibharti taṃ jahi yadi durge hantāsīti sa darbhapuñjīlam udvṛhya saptagirīn bhittvā tam ahan |	Now a boar, stealer of the good, [2] keeps the wealth of the Asuras which is to be won beyond the seven hills. Him smite, if thou art he who smites in the stronghold.' He plucked out a bunch of Darbha grass, pierced the seven hills, and smote him.
so 'bravīt | durgād vā āhartāvocathā etam ā hareti tam ebhyo yajña eva yajñam āharat |	He said, 'Thou art called he who brings from the stronghold; bring him.' So the sacrifice bore off the sacrifice for them;
yat tad vittaṃ vedyam asurāṇām avindanta tad ekaṃ vedyai veditvam asurāṇām | vā iyam agra āsīt |	in that they won the wealth of the Asuras which was to be won (védyam), that alone is the reason why the Vedi is so called.
yāvad āsīnaḥ parāpaśyati tāvad devānām | te devā abruvan |	The Asuras [3] indeed at first owned the earth, the gods had so much as one seated can espy.
astv eva no 'syām apīti kiyad vo dāsyāma iti yāvad iyaṃ salāvṛkī triḥ parikrāmati tāvan no datteti sa indraḥ salāvṛkī rūpaṃ kṛtvemāṃ triḥ sarvataḥ pary akrāmat tad imām avindanta yad imām avindanta tad vedyai veditvam |	The gods said, 'May we also have a share in the earth?' 'How much shall we give you?' 'Give us as much as this Salavrki can thrice run round.' Indra taking the form of a Salavrki thrice ran round on all sides the earth. So they won the earth, and in that they won it therefore is the Vedi so called [4].

The back cross-line is thirty feet, the eastern line is thirty-six feet, the front cross-line is twenty-four feet. These make up tens; the Viraj has ten syllables; the Viraj is food;
ud dhanti yad evāsyā amedhyaṃ tad apa hanti |	verily he digs away whatever in it is impure.
ud dhanti tasmād oṣadhayaḥ parā bhavanti barhi stṛṇāti tasmād oṣadhayaḥ punar ā bhavanti |	He digs up; therefore the plants perish. He spreads the sacrificial strew; therefore the plants again revive.
uttaram barhiṣa uttarabarhi stṛṇāti prajā vai barhir yajamāna uttarabarhis |	He spreads over the strew the upper strew. The strew is the people; the upper strew is the sacrificer;
yajamānam evāyajamānād uttaraṃ karoti tasmād yajamāno 'yajamānād uttaraḥ |	verily he makes the sacrificer higher than the man who does not sacrifice; therefore the sacrificer is higher than the man who does not sacrifice.

If there were twelve Upasads in the oneday rite, and three in the Ahina, the sacrifice would be upset. There are three Upasads in the oneday rite, twelve in the Ahina, to preserve the strength of the sacrifice;

So he takes one teat for his milk drink, then two, then three, then four. That [1] is the razor-edged drink by which he drives away his foes when born and repels them when about to be born; verily also with the smaller he approaches the greater. He takes the four teats first for his drink, then three, then two, then one.

Manu was wont thrice to take drink, the Asuras twice, the gods once [3].

Now with regard to his drinking at midday and at midnight, it is in the middle that people feed themselves; verily he places strength in the middle of himself, for the overcoming of his foes. He prospers himself [4], his foe is overcome.

If the man who is consecrated were to leave the consecration-shed, it would be as when a foetus falls from the womb. He must not leave, to guard himself.

Therefore if the man who is consecrated were to leave (the shed), he would be likely to spring up and slay him. He must not leave, to protect himself. He lies on the right side; that is the abode of the sacrifice;
agnim abhyāvṛtya śaye devatā eva yajñam abhyāvṛtya śaye |	He lies turned towards the fire; verily he lies turned towards the gods and the sacrifice.

He should make it touch the road or a pit so that neither a wagon nor a chariot can go between [1]. That is a contiguous place of sacrifice. He conquers (apnoti) his foe, his foe conquers him not.
ekonnate devayajane yājajet paśukāmam ekonnatād vai devayajanād aṅgirasaḥ paśūn asṛjanta |	On a place of sacrifice which is elevated in one place he should make him to sacrifice who desires cattle. The Angirases produced cattle from a place of sacrifice elevated in one place.

On a place of sacrifice which is firm should he make him to sacrifice who desires support. That is a place of sacrifice which is firm, which is level on all sides; verily he finds, support. Where diverse plants are intertwined, there should he make him sacrifice who desires cattle.
rūpeṇaivāsmai paśūn |	That is the form of cattle;

The gods reflected, 'Whichever of the two she joins, they will become this.' They called to her; she said, 'Let me choose a boon; through me shall ye obtain all your desires, but the oblation shall come to me before (it comes to) the fire.' Therefore do they besprinkle the high altar before (they sprinkle) the fire, for that was its chosen boon.

In that he sprinkles the high altar, verily thus does the sacrificer repel his foes from the quarters. Indra gave the Yatis to the Salavrkas; them they ate on the right of the high altar. Whatever is left of the sprinkling waters he should pour on the right of the high altar;

They perished when carrying the offering to the gods. Agni was afraid, 'This one here will come to ruin.' He went away. The (night) he spent among the trees was with the Butea frondosa: the (night) among the plants was with the Sugandhitejana; the (night) among the cattle was between the horns of a ram.
upa na ā vartasva havyaṃ no vaheti so 'bravīt |	bear the offering for us.' He said, 'Let me choose a boon.

upānakti patnī hi sarvasya mitram mitratvāya yad vai patnī yajñasya karoti mithunaṃ tat |	(verily it serves) for atonement. The wife (of the sacrificer) [1] anoints (them), for the wife is every one's friend, for friendship.

The gods drove away the Asuras who were in front by the sacrifices which they offered on the eastern side, and the Asuras who were behind by those which they offered on the western side. Soma libations are offered in the east, seated to the west he besprinkles the altars; verily from behind and from in front the sacrificer smites away his enemies; therefore offspring are engendered behind, and are brought forth in front [4].

āttaḥ somo bhavaty atha |	The Soma is ready at hand;
vaisarjanāni juhoti rakṣasām apahatyai tvaṃ soma tanūkṛdbhya ity āha tanūkṛd dhy {eṣa < eṣas} dveṣobhyo 'nyakṛtebhya ity āha |	so he offers [1] the Vaisarjanas, to smite away the Raksases. 'Thou, O Soma, brought about by ourselves', he says, for he is the one who brings about by himself;
anyakṛtāni hi rakṣāṃsi |	'from hostility brought about by others', he says, for the Raksases are brought about by others;

He offers in the Agnidh's fire with a verse containing the word 'lead', for leading to the world of heaven.

If he were not to say that formula, the sacrificer would be without offspring or cattle.

svadhā pitṛbhya ity āha svadhākāro hi |	'svadhá' to the Pitrs', be says, for the svadhá call is the due of the Pitrs [5].
pitṝṇām idam ahaṃ nir varuṇasya pāśād ity āha varuṇapāśād eva nir mucyate |	'Here (may) I (be free) from Varuna's noose', he says; verily he is freed from Varuna's noose.

If he desire of a man, 'May I unite him with brilliance, with the deities, with power' [4], he should set up for him the corner (of the post) near the fire in a line with the Ahavaniya;

In that be sets up the post, (it is) to discern the world of heaven. He puts (it) up to the east (of the fire), for before the sacrifice it is proclaimed, for what is not proclaimed is that of which when it is passed men say, 'This should have been done.' The Sadhya gods despised the sacrifice; the sacrifice touched them not;

When the Soma sacrifice is complete he casts (in the fire) the bunch of grass, he offers the chip, to avoid disturbing the sacrifice. The Sadhya gods were in this world and nothing else living. They offered Agni as a sacrifice to Agni, for they found nothing else to offer;
yat paśum ālabhyāgnim manthed rudrāya yajamānam | api dadhyāt pramāyukaḥ syāt | atho khalv āhus |	if he were to produce the fire after offering the beast, he would place the sacrificer in the power of Rudra [1], and he would be liable to die.

Having offered in sacrifice the beast, he strews over (it) a cake, verily he sacrifices it with its sap. Having performed the rite with the omentum, he performs with the cake;
paśum ālabhya puroḍāśaṃ nir vapati samedham evainam ā labhate vapayā pracarya puroḍāśena pra caraty ūrg vai puroḍāśa ūrjam eva paśūnām madhyato dadhāty atho paśor eva chidram api dadhāti pṛṣadājyasyopahatya triḥ pṛchati śṛtaṃ havīḥ śamitar iti triṣatyā hi devā yo 'śṛtaṃ śṛtam āha sa enasā prāṇāpānau vā etau paśūnām |	verily also he closes the cut in the beast. Having made offering of the speckled ghee, he thrice asks, 'Is the oblation cooked, Çamitr?' for the gods found truth in three (cookings). He who says what is not cooked is cooked (is burdened) with sin. The speckled butter is the expiration and the inspiration of cattle [1]; when the beast is offered the body comes into the heart;
yat pṛṣadājyam paśoḥ khalu vā ālabdhasya hṛdayam ātmābhi sam eti yat pṛṣadājyena hṛdayam abhighārayaty ātmann eva paśūnām prāṇāpānau dadhāti paśunā vai devāḥ suvargaṃ lokam āyan te 'manyanta manuṣyā no 'nvābhaviṣyantīti tasya śiraś chittvā medham prākṣārayant sa prakṣo 'bhavat tat prakṣasya prakṣatvaṃ yat plakṣaśākhottarabarhir bhavati samedhasyaiva |	By means of the beast the gods went to the world of heaven. They reflected, 'Men will mount after us.' They cut off its head and made its sap stream forth; it became the Praksa (tree); that is the nature of the Praksa. In that there is a branch of the Praksa above the strew, so he cuts off from the victim when it has its sap [2].
paśor ava dyati paśuṃ vai hriyamāṇaṃ rakṣāṃsy anu sacante 'ntarā yūpaṃ cāhavanīyaṃ ca harati rakṣasām apahatyai paśor vā ālabdhasya mano 'pa krāmati manotāyai haviṣo 'vadīyamānasyānu brūhīty āha mana evāsyāva runddhe |	As the beast is borne along the Raksases follow after it; he takes it between the sacrificial post and the Ahavaniya, to smite away the Raksases. When the beast is offered its mind departs. 'Recite to Manota, for the oblation which is being divided', he says verily he secures its mind.
ekādaśāvadānāny ava dyati daśa vai paśoḥ prāṇā ātmaikādaśo yāvān eva paśus tasyāva |	He cuts off eleven portions; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the body is the eleventh, he cuts off as much as is the size of the beast [3].
dyati hṛdayasyāgre 'va dyaty atha jihvāyā atha vakṣaso yad vai hṛdayenābhigachati taj jihvayā vadati yaj jihvayā vadati tad uraso 'dhi nir vadati |	First he makes a portion of the heart, then of the tongue, then of the breast: what he conceives with the heart, that he says with the tongue; what he says with the tongue, that he utters from the breast.
etad vai paśor yathāpūrvaṃ yasyaivam avadāya yathākāmam uttareṣām avadyati yathāpūrvam evāsya paśor avattam bhavati madhyato gudasyāva dyati madhyato hi prāṇa uttamasyāva dyati |	If he cuts off thus and then cuts from the rest at will, still the cutting off from that animal has been made in order. In the middle he makes a portion of the intestines, for breath is in the middle; he makes a portion of the upper part [4], for breath is in the upper part;
uttamo hi prāṇo yadītaraṃ yadītaram ubhayam evājāmi jāyamāno vai brāhmaṇas tribhir ṛṇavā jāyate brahmacaryeṇarṣibhyo yajñena devebhyaḥ prajayā pitṛbhya eṣa vā anṛṇo yaḥ putrī yajvā brahmacārivāsī tad avadānair evāva dayate tad avadānānām avadānatvam |	whether he does one, or the other, there is variation in both cases. A Brahman on birth is born with a threefold debt, of pupilship to the Rsis, of sacrifice to the gods, of offspring to the Pitrs. He is freed from his debt who has a son, is a sacrificer, and who has lived as a pupil: this (debt) he performs (ávadayate) by these cuttings off', and that is why the cuttings-off (avadána) have their name.
devāsurāḥ saṃyattā āsan te devā agnim abruvan tvayā vīreṇāsurān abhi bhavāmeti |	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods said to Agni, 'With thee as our hero let us overcome the Asuras' [5].
so 'bravīd varaṃ vṛṇai paśor uddhāram ud dharā iti sa etam uddhāram ud aharata doḥ pūrvārdhasya gudam madhyataḥ śroṇiṃ jaghanārdhasya tato devā abhavan parāsurā yat tryaṅgāṇāṃ samavadyati bhrātṛvyābhibhūtyai bhavaty ātmanā parāsya bhrātṛvyo bhavati |	let me have a choice part of the beast.' He chose that choice part (of the beast), the shoulder from the fore part, the intestines from the middle, the hip from the hind part. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated; in that he makes portions of three members it is for the overcoming of his foe; he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. He cuts off transversely;
akṣṇayāva dyati tasmād akṣṇayā paśavo 'ṅgāni pra haranti pratiṣṭhityai |	therefore cattle move forward their limbs transversely, for support. He covers the dipping-spoons with fat;

He stirs the oblation of fat with the rib; the rib is the middle of cattle, the fat is the sap of cattle; in that he stirs the oblation of fat with the rib, he places sap in the middle of cattle.

'May Indra's expiration be set in every limb', he says; verily he bestows expiration and inspiration upon cattle. 'O god Tvastr, let much be united for thee', he says;
viṣurūpā yat salakṣmāṇo bhavathety āha viṣurūpā hy ete santaḥ salakṣmāṇa etarhi havanti devatrā yantam |	for cattle have Tvastr as their deity. 'When ye that are various become of one form', he says; for they being various become then of one form.
avase sakhāyo 'nu tvā mātā pitaro madantv ity āhānumatam evainam mātrā pitrā suvargaṃ lokaṃ gamayati |	'Over thee as thou goest among the gods [2] for help let thy comrades and thy father and mother rejoice', he says; verily he makes him, approved by his mother and his father, go to the world of heaven.
ardharce vasāhomaṃ juhoty asau vā ardharca iyam ardhaca ime eva rasenānakti diśo juhoti diśa eva rasenānakty atho digbhya evorjaṃ rasam ava runddhe prāṇāpānau vā etau paśūnāṃ yat pṛṣadājyaṃ vānaspatyāḥ khalu |	the half-verse is yonder (sky) and the half-verse is this (earth); verily with sap he adorns both. He offers to the quarters; verily with sap he adorns the quarters; verily from the quarters he wins strength and sap.
vai devatayā paśavo yat pṛṣadājyasyopahatyāha vanaspataye 'nu brūhi vanaspataye preṣyeti prāṇāpānāv eva paśuṣu dadhāti |	cattle have the lord of the forest [3] for their deity; in that having made offering of the speckled butter he says, 'Recite for the lord of the forest, give directions for the lord of the forest', he bestows expiration and inspiration upon cattle.
anyasyānyasya samavattaṃ samavadyati tasmān nānārūpāḥ paśavas |	Of each he divides the divided pieces; there fore cattle have various forms.
yūṣṇopa siñcati raso vā eṣa paśūnāṃ yad yū rasam eva paśuṣu dadhāti |	He moistens (it) with soup; soup is the sap of cattle; verily he bestows sap upon cattle.
iḍām upa hvayate paśavo vā iḍā paśūn evopa hvayate catur upa hvayate |	He invokes the Ida; the Ida is cattle; verily he invokes cattle. Four times he invokes [4], for cattle have four feet.
catuṣpādo hi paśavas |	cattle are distinguished by fat;
apaśuḥ syād ity amedaskaṃ tasmā ā dadhyān medorūpā vai paśavo rūpeṇaivainam paśubhyo nir bhajaty apaśur eva bhavati yaṃ kāmayeta paśu mānt syād iti medasvat tasmā ā dadhyān medorūpā vai paśavo rūpeṇaivāsmai paśūn ava runddhe paśumān eva bhavati prajāpatir yajñam asṛja sa ājyam |	verily by means of their distinctive mark he deprives him of cattle, and he has no cattle. If he desire of a man, 'May he have cattle', he should take for him (a piece) with fat; cattle are distinguished by fat; verily by means of their distinctive mark he wins cattle for him, and he has cattle. Prajapati created the sacrifice;
purastād asṛjata paśum madhyataḥ pṛṣadājyam paścāt tasmād ājyena prayājā ijyante paśunā paśunā madhyataḥ pṛṣadājyenānūyājās tasmād etan miśram iva paścātsṛṣṭaṃ hi |	he first created the butter [5], in the middle the beast, last the speckled butter; therefore the fore-sacrifices are performed with butter, the beast (is offered) in the middle, and the after-sacrifices with speckled butter. Therefore that is mixed as it were, for it was created last.

Now they kill the beast when they dispose of it;
yajñena vai prajāpatiḥ prajā asṛjata tā upayaḍbhir evāsṛjata yad upayaja upayajati prajā eva tad yajamānaḥ sṛjate jaghanārdhād ava dyati jaghanārdhād dhi prajāḥ prajāyante sthavimato 'va dyati sthavimato hi prajāḥ prajāyante |	verily he created them by the subsidiary sacrifices; in that he offers the subsidiary sacrifices, verily thus the sacrificer creates offspring. He cuts off from the hind portion, for from the hind portion offspring are born; he cuts off from the thick side, for offspring are born from the thick side;
asambhindann ava dyati prāṇānām asambhedāya na paryāvartayati yat paryāvartayed udāvartaḥ prajā grāhukaḥ syāt samudraṃ gacha svāhety āha retaḥ |	he cuts off without confusion, to prevent confusion of the vital airs.

He makes a portion of the vital airs, who makes portion of the intestines; 'Give me mind and heart', he says; verily he summons the vital airs according to their places.
abhi sam eti yat pṛthivyāṃ hṛdayaśūlam udvāsayet pṛthivīṃ śucārpayet |	it gathers round the heart-spit [4]. if he were to place the heart-spit on the earth, he would cause pain to the earth;

That is why the Vasativari (waters) have their name.

They became the Vahantis. He takes of the Vahantis; verily he takes those of waters which are pure, fit for sacrifice, and divine. He should not pass over the nearest Vahantis;
yad antamā vahantīr atīyād yajñam ati manyeta na sthāvarāṇāṃ gṛhṇīyāt |	if he were to pass over the nearest Vahantis, he would despise the sacrifice. He should not take of stagnant (waters);

lokebhyaḥ sam bharati somo vai rājā diśo 'bhy adhyāyat sa diśo 'nu prāviśat prāg apāg udag adharāg ity āha digbhya evainaṃ sam bharaty atho diśa evāsmā ava runddhe |	Soma, the king, reflected on the quarters, he entered the quarters; 'forward, behind, upward, downward', he says, verily from the quarters he gathers him; verily also he wins the quarters for him. 'O mother, come forth', he says;
amba ni ṣvarety āha kāmukā enaṃ striyo bhavanti ya evaṃ veda yat te somādābhyaṃ nāma jāgṛvīti |	women are likely to desire him who knows thus. 'Thy unerring, watchful name, O Soma', he says [3];
eṣa vai somasya somapīthas |	this is Soma's Soma-drinking;
ya evaṃ veda na saumyām ārtim ārchati ghnanti vā etat somaṃ yad abhiṣuṇvanti |	he who knows thus reaches not destruction from Soma. When they press Soma they kill him;
aṃśūn apa gṛhṇāti trāyata evainam prāṇā vā aṃśavaḥ paśavaḥ somas |	verily he protects him. The shoots are the vital airs, Soma is cattle;
aṃśūn punar api sṛjati prāṇān eva paśuṣu dadhāti dvaudvāv api sṛjati tasmād dvaudvau prāṇāḥ |	he later lets go the shoots; verily he bestows vital airs upon cattle; two by two he lets them go; therefore the vital airs are in pairs.
prāṇo vā eṣa yad upāṃśus |	The Upançu Cup is breath;
yad upāṃśvagrā grahā gṛhyante prāṇam evānu pra yanti |	in that the cups are drawn beginning with the Upançu, they follow on breath.
aruṇo ha smāhaupaveśiḥ prātaḥsavana evāhaṃ yajñaṃ saṃ sthāpayāmi tena tataḥ saṃsthitena carāmīti |	Aruna Aupaveçi used to say, 'At the morning pressing I establish the sacrifice and then I proceed with it when it has been established.' He first presses eight times;
aṣṭau kṛtvo 'gre 'bhi ṣuṇoti | aṣṭākṣarā gāyatrī gāyatram prātaḥsavanam prātaḥsavanam eva tenāpnoti |	the Gayatri has eight syllables, the morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily thereby he obtains the morning pressing.
ekādaśa kṛtvo dvitīyam ekādaśākṣarā tṛṣṭubh | traiṣṭubham mādhyaṃdinam |	(He presses) eleven times on the second occasion; the Tristubh has eleven syllables, the midday pressing is connected with the Tristubh [1];
savanam mādhyaṃdinam eva savanaṃ tenāpnoti dvādaśa kṛtvas tṛtīyam |	verily thereby he obtains the midday pressing. (He presses) twelve times on the third occasion;
dvādaśākṣarā jagatī jāgataṃ tṛtīyasavanam |	the Jagati has twelve syllables, the third pressing is connected with the Jagati;
tṛtīyasavanam eva tenāpnoti |	verily thereby he obtains the third pressing.
etāṃ ha vāva sa yajñasya saṃsthitim uvāca |	This is what he calls the establishment of the sacrifice, to prevent loss;
aksannaṃ hi tad yad yajñasya saṃsthitasya skandati |	for what falls when the sacrifice is established is not lost.
atho khalv āhus | gāyatrī vāva prātaḥsavane nātivāda iti |	Or rather they say, 'The Gayatri is not open to question' at the morning pressing';
anativāduka enam bhrātṛvyo bhavati ya evaṃ veda tasmād aṣṭāvaṣṭau |	he who knows thus is not liable to question from his foe; therefore eight times in each case should press [2].
kṛtvo 'bhiṣutyam brahmavādino vadanati pavitravanto 'nye grahā gṛhyante kimpavitra upāṃśur iti vākpavitra iti brūyāt |	The theologians say, 'Other cups are drawn with a strainer; what strainer has the Upançu?' 'Speech is the strainer', he should reply.

'With the shoots of the male', he says, for the shoots of the Soma are the shoots of the male; 'purified by the arms', he says, for by the arms he purifies him; 'thou art the god, purifier of gods', he says, for he being a god [3] is the purifier of gods;
yeṣām bhāgo 'si tebhyas tvety āha yeṣāṃ hy eṣa bhāgas tebhya enaṃ gṛhṇāti svāṃkṛto 'sīty āha prāṇam eva svam akṛta madhumatīr na iṣas kṛdhīty āha sarvam evāsmā idaṃ svadayati viśvebhyas tvendriyebhyo divyebhyaḥ pārthivebhya ity āha |	'to those thee whose portion thou art', he says, for he draws him for those whose portion he is. 'Thou art he who is appropriated', he says; verily he makes breath his own; 'make our food full of sweetness for us', he says; verily he makes all food sweet for him;
ubhayeṣv eva devamanuṣyeṣu prāṇān dadhāti manas tvā |	verily upon both gods and men he bestows the vital airs.

'Hail! Thee, of kindly nature, to the sun!' he says; the gods of kindly nature are the breaths;
ādityasya vai raśmayo devā marīcipās teṣāṃ tad bhāgadheyam |	'To the gods that drink the rays thee!' he says; the gods that drink the rays are the rays of the sun;
tān eva tena prīṇāti yadi kāmayeta varṣukaḥ parjanyaḥ | syād iti nīcā hastena ni mṛjyāt |	that is their share; verily thereby he delights them. If he desire, 'May Parjanya rain' [5], he should rub (the cup) with the (palm of) the hand downwards;
vṛṣṭim eva ni yachati yadi kāmayeta | avarṣukaḥ syād ity uttānena ni mṛjyāt |	If he desire, 'May it not rain', he should rub with the hand upwards; verily he keeps up the rain.
vṛṣṭim evod yachati yady abhicared amuṃ jahy atha tvā hoṣyāmīti brūyāt |	If he practise witchcraft, 'Slay N.N.; then will I sacrifice to thee', he should say;
āhutim evainam prāpsan hanti yadi dūre syād ā tamitos tiṣṭhet prāṇam evāsyānugatya hanti yady abhicared amuṣya |	verily desiring the libation he slays him. If he be far away, he should stand until he is weary; verily he follows his breath and slays him.
tvā prāṇe {F sādayāmīti}{W sādayamīti}{GLOS sādayāmīti} sādayet |	If he practise witchcraft [6], he should put (it) down (with the words), 'I set thee down on the breath of N.N.';
asanno vai prāṇaḥ prāṇam evāsya sādayati ṣaḍbhir aṃśubhiḥ pavayati ṣaḍ vā ṛtavas |	verily he brings his breath to rest. He purifies by means of six shoots; the seasons are six; verily he purifies him by means of the seasons;

In that thrice he draws separately the Upançu with his hand, therefore there are three animals which take by the hand, man, the elephant, and the ape.

The gods saw that the sacrifice must be established in the Upançu (cup), and they established it in the Upançu. The Asuras grasping the thunderbolt attacked the gods; the gods in fear ran up to Indra, Indra obstructed them' by means of the Antaryama (cup), and that is why the Antaryama has its name, 'the obstructor'.
yad antaryāmo gṛhyate bhrātṛvyān eva tad yajamāno 'ntar dhatte |	In that the Antaryama cup is drawn, verily thus the sacrificer obstructs his foes.

indro vā idam abhūd yad vayaṃ sma iti te 'bruvan maghavann anu na ā bhajeti sajoṣā devair avaraiḥ paraiś cety abravīt |	The gods reflected, 'Indra hath now become what we are'; they said, 'O bounteous one, give us a share'; 'In unison with the gods, the lower and the higher', he replied;
ye caiva devāḥ pare ye cāvare tān ubhayān | anvābhajat sajoṣā devair avaraiḥ paraiś cety āha ye caiva devāḥ pare ye cāvare tān ubhayān anvābhajati |	to both (the sets of) gods, the lower and the higher [2], he gave a share. 'In unison with the gods, the lower and the higher', he says; to both (the sets of) gods, the lower and the higher, he gives a share.
antaryāme maghavan mādayasvety āha yajñād eva yajamānaṃ nāntar eti |	'O bounteous one, do thou rejoice in the Antaryama', he says; verily he does not cut off the sacrificer from the sacrifice.
upayāmagṛhīto 'sīty āha |	'Thou art taken with a support', he says, for the support of inspiration.
apānasya dhṛtyai yad ubhāv apavitrau gṛhyeyātām prāṇam apāno 'nu ny ṛchet pramāyukaḥ syāt pavitravān antaryāmo gṛhyate |	If both (cups) were drawn without a filter, inspiration would follow expiration, he would be likely to die. The Antaryama is drawn with a filter [3], to separate expiration and inspiration.
prāṇāpānayor vidhṛtyai prāṇāpānau vā etau yad upāṃśvantaryāmau vyāna upāṃśusavanas |	The Upançu and the Antaryama (cups) are expiration and inspiration, the Upançu pressing-(stone) is cross-breathing.
yaṃ kāmayeta pramāyukaḥ syād ity asaṃspṛṣṭau tasya sādayet |	If he desire of a man, 'May he be likely to die', he should set them down for him without being in contact;

vāg vā eṣā yad aindravāyavas | yad aindravāyavāgrā grahā gṛhyante vācam evānu pra yanti vāyuṃ devā abruvan |	The cup for Indra and Vayu is speech; in that the cups are drawn beginning with that to Indra and Vayu, verily they follow speech.
somaṃ rājānaṃ hanāmeti so 'bravīt |	The gods said to Vayu, 'Let us slay Soma, the king';
varaṃ vṛṇai madagrā eva vo grahā gṛhyāntā iti tasmād aindravāyavāgrā grahā gṛhyante tam aghnan |	let your cups be drawn with mine first.' Therefore the cups are drawn with those for Indra and Vayu first. They slew him;
so 'pūyat taṃ devā nopādhṛṣṇuvan te vāyum abruvan | imaṃ naḥ svadaya |	he became putrid; the gods could not endure him, they said to Vayu, 'Make him sweet for us' [1];
iti so 'bravīt |	he replied, 'Let me choose a boon;
varaṃ vṛṇai maddevatyāny eva vaḥ pātrāṇy ucyāntā iti tasmān nānādevatyāni santi vāyavyāny ucyante tam ebhyo vāyur evāsvadayat tasmād yat pūyati tat pravāte vi ṣajanti vāyur hi tasya pavayitā svadayitā tasya vigrahaṇaṃ nāvindan |	let your vessels, be said to have me as their deity.' Therefore, being of various deities, they are said to have Vayu as their deity. Verily did Vayu make him sweet for him; therefore what becomes putrid they hang out in a windy place, for Vayu is its purifier, its sweetener.
sāditir abravīt |	Aditi said, 'Let me choose a boon;
varaṃ vṛṇā atha mayā vi gṛhṇīdhvam maddevatyā eva vaḥ somāḥ |	then shall ye distribute through me, verily with me as deity may your Soma (draughts) be set down' [2].

Speech aforetime spoke without discrimination; the gods said to Indra, 'Do thou discriminate this speech for us';
imāṃ no vācaṃ vyākurv iti so 'bravīt |	he replied, 'Let me choose a boon;
varaṃ vṛṇai mahyaṃ caivaiṣa vāyave ca saha gṛhyātā iti tasmād aindravāyavaḥ saha gṛhyate tām indro madhyato 'vakramya vyākarot tasmād iyaṃ vyākṛtā vāg udyate tasmāt sakṛd indrāya madhyato gṛhyate dvir vāyave dvau hi sa varāv avṛṇīta |	let this (cup) be drawn for me and for Vayu together.' Therefore the cup is drawn together for Indra and Vayu. Indra approaching it in the midst discriminated it; therefore is speech spoken distinctly. Therefore is it drawn once, in the middle, for Indra, and twice for Vayu, for he chose two boons.
mitraṃ devā abruvan | somaṃ rājānaṃ hanāmeti so 'bravīt |	The gods said to Mitra, 'Let us slay Soma, the king';
nāhaṃ sarvasya vā aham mitram asmīti tam abruvan hanāmaiveti so 'bravīt |	he replied, 'Not I; for I am the friend of all'; they answered, 'Still we will slay him';
varaṃ vṛṇai payasaiva me somaṃ śrīṇann iti tasmān maitrāvaruṇam payasā śrīṇanti tasmāt paśavo 'pākrāman mitraḥ san krūram akar iti krūram iva khalu vā eṣaḥ |	let them mix the Soma for me with milk.' Therefore they mix with milk (the Soma) for Mitra and Varuna. From him cattle departed (saying), 'He that was a friend hath done a cruel deed'; a cruel deed as it were [1] does he do who sacrifices with Soma;
karoti yaḥ somena yajate tasmāt paśavo 'pa krāmanti yan maitrāvaruṇam payasā śrīṇāti paśubhir eva tan mitraṃ samardhayati paśubhir yajamānam purā khalu vāvaivam mitro 'vet |	In that he mixes with milk (the Soma) for Mitra and Varuna, he unites Mitra with cattle, and the sacrificer with cattle. Aforetime indeed was Mitra thus aware,' When I have done this cruel deed, cattle will depart from me';
apa mat krūraṃ cakruṣaḥ paśavaḥ kramiṣyantīti tasmād evam avṛṇīta varuṇaṃ devā abruvan tvayāṃśabhuvā somaṃ rājānaṃ hanāmeti so 'bravīt |	therefore he chose thus. The gods said to Varuna, 'With thee as helper we will slay Soma, the king';
varaṃ vṛṇai mahyaṃ ca | evaiṣa mitrāya ca saha gṛhyātā iti tasmān maitrāvaruṇaḥ saha gṛhyate tasmād rājñā rājānam aṃśabhuvā ghnanti vaiśyena vaiśyaṃ śūdreṇa sūdram |	he replied, 'Let me choose a boon, for me [2] and Mitra together let this (cup) be drawn.' Therefore it is drawn for Mitra and Varuna together; therefore with a king as helper they slay a king, with a Vaiçya a Vaiçya, with a Çudra a Çudra.
na vā idaṃ divā na naktam āsīd avyāvṛttam |	This was not day or night, but undiscriminated;
te devā mitrāvaruṇāv abruvan |	the gods said to Mitra and Varuna, 'Make this to shine forth for us';
idaṃ no vi vāsayatam iti tāv abrūtām |	they replied, 'Let us choose a boon;
varaṃ vṛṇāvahā eka evāvat pūrvo {F graho}{W graho} gṛhyātā iti tasmād aindravāyavaḥ pūrvo maitrāvaruṇād gṛhyate prāṇāpānau hy etau yad upāṃśvantaryāmau mitro 'har ajanayad varuṇo rātrim |	let one cup only be drawn before ours.' Therefore the cup for Indra and Vayu is drawn before that for Mitra and Varuna, for the Upançu and the Antaryama (cups) are expiration and inspiration. Mitra produced the day, Varuna the night;
tato vā idaṃ vy auchat |	then indeed did this shine forth;
yan maitrāvaruṇo gṛhyate vyuṣṭyai |	in that (a cup) is drawn for Mitra and Varuna, (it is) for shining forth.
yajñasya śiro 'chidyata te devā aśvināv abruvan bhiṣajau vai stha idaṃ yajñasya śiraḥ prati dhattam iti tāv abrūtām |	The head of the sacrifice was cut; the gods said to the Açvins, Ye are physicians; do ye replace the head of the sacrifice', they replied.
varaṃ vṛṇāvahai graha eva nāv atrāpi gṛhyatām iti tābhyām etam āśvinam agṛhṇan tato vai tau yajñasya śiraḥ praty adhatām |	Let us choose a boon; let there be drawn a cup for us also herein.' For them they drew this cup for the Açvins; then indeed did they replace the head of the sacrifice;
yad āśvino gṛhyate yajñasya niṣkṛtyai tau devā abruvan |	in that (the cup) for the Açvins is drawn, (it is) to restore the sacrifice.
bhiṣajāv iti tasmād brāhmaṇena bheṣajaṃ na kāryam apūto hy eṣo 'medhyo yo {bhiṣak < bhiṣaj} tau bahiṣpavamānena pavayitvā tābhyām etam āśvinam agṛhṇan tasmād bahiṣpavamāne stuta āśvino gṛhyate tasmād evaṃ viduṣā bahiṣpavamāna upasadyaḥ pavitraṃ vai bahiṣpavamāna ātmānam eva pavayate tayos tredhā bhaiṣajyaṃ vi ny adadhus |	The gods said of these two, 'Impure are they, wandering among men [1] and physicians.' Therefore a Brahman should not practise medicine, for the physician is impure, unfit for the sacrifice. Having purified them by the Bahispavamana (Stotra) they drew for them this cup for the Açvins; therefore (the cup) for the Açvins is drawn when the Bahispavamana has been sung. Therefore by one who knows thus the Bahispavamana should be performed; verily he purifies himself.
agnau tṛtīyam apsu tṛtīyam brāhmaṇe tṛtīyam |	Their skill as physicians they deposited in three places, in Agni a third, in the waters a third, in the Brahman a third.
tasmād udapātram | upanidhāya brāhmaṇaṃ dakṣiṇato niṣādya bheṣajaṃ kuryāt |	Therefore one should put beside him a pot of water [2] and sit on the right hand of a Brahman when practising medicine;

In that (the cups) are drawn in one vessel, therefore there is one breath within; they are offered in two vessels, therefore the breaths outside are in pairs. Those that are for two deities are the breaths, the Ida is cattle; if he should summon the Ida before those that are for two deities [3], he would obstruct his breaths by cattle, he would be likely to perish. Having eaten those for two deities, he summons the Ida;
paśubhiḥ prāṇān antar dadhīta pramāyukaḥ syāt |	verily having placed the breaths in himself he summons the Ida.

He sets down in the north track of the southern oblation-cart; verily he places speech in speech.

Brhaspati was the Purohita of the gods, Çanda and Marka of the Asuras; the gods had the holy power (Brahman), the Asuras had the holy power (Brahman); they could not overcome one another;
te devāḥ śaṇḍāmarkāv upāmantrayanta tāv abrūtām |	the gods invited Çanda and Marka;
varaṃ vṛṇāvahai grahāv eva nāv atrāpi gṛhyetām iti tābhyām etau śukrāmanthināv agṛhṇan tato devā abhavan parāsurās |	they replied, 'Let us choose a boon; let cups be drawn for us also herein.' For them they drew these cups for Çukra and Manthin; then did the gods prosper, the Asuras were defeated.
yasyaivaṃ viduṣaḥ śukrāmanthinau gṛhyete bhavaty ātmanā parā |	He for whom knowing thus these Çukra and Manthin (cups) are drawn, prospers himself, his foe [1] is defeated.
asya bhrātrivyo bhavati tau devā apanudyātmana indrāyājuhavus |	Having driven away these two, the gods offered to themselves,' to Indra.
apanuttau śaṇḍāmarkau sahāmuneti brūyād yaṃ dviṣyāt |	'Driven away are Çanda and Marka together with N.N.', he should say of whom he hates;
yam eva dveṣṭi tenainau sahāpa nudate sa prathamaḥ saṃkṛtir viśvakarmety evaināv ātmana indrāyājuhavus | indro hy etāni rūpāṇi karikrad acarat |	with him whom he hates he thus drives them away. 'This is the first preparer, all maker', (with these words) they offered to themselves, to Indra, these (cups), for Indra kept making these forms.
asau vā ādityaḥ śukraś candramā manthī |	The Çukra is yonder sun, the Manthin is the moon;
apigṛhya prāñcau niḥ |	they depart towards the east, closing their eyes [2];

Turning back towards the west they sacrifice, therefore men see them going west. The Çukra and the Manthin are the eyes of the sacrifice, the high altar is the nose.

Now the offerings the gods made on the east, with them they drove away the Asuras who were in front [3]; with those on the west they drove away the Asuras who were behind;

In accordance with the Çukra and Manthin are offspring born, the eaters and the eaten. 'Engendering heroic off spring), come forth, Çukra, with pure radiance' [4], 'Engendering prolific offspring, come forth, Manthin, with mixed radiance', he says;
etā vai suvīrā yā attrīs | etāḥ suprajā yā ādyās |	'the eaters are those who are heroic, the eaten those that are prolific.
ya evaṃ vedāttry asya prajā jāyate nādyā prajāpater akṣy aśvayat tat parāpatat tad vikaṅkatam prāviśat tad vikaṅkate nāramata tad yavam prāviśat tad yave 'ramata tad yavasya |	The offspring of him who knows thus becomes an eater, not eaten. The eye of Prajapati swelled; it fell away, it entered the Vikankata, it did not stay in the Vikankata; it entered barley, it stayed in barley;
yavatvam |	that is why barley has its name [5].

The theologians say, 'For what reason does the Manthin vessel not go to the Sadas?' 'It is the vessel of misfortune', he should say;
yad aśnuvītāndho 'dhvaryuḥ syād{FN corrected in IS Ed: syād} ārtim ārchet tasmān nāśnute |	if it were to go there, the Adhvaryu would be blind, he would be ruined; therefore it does not go there.

Speech departed from the gods, not being willing to remain for the sacrifice; when speech had departed the gods silently drew the cups; speech reflected, 'They are excluding me';
tasmād āgrayaṇe vāg vi sṛjyate yat tūṣṇīm pūrve grahā gṛhyante yathā tsārī |	it went into the Agrayana; that is why the Agrayana has its name [2]. Therefore in the Agrayana speech is uttered.

The Adhvaryu taking the Agrayana, commencing the sacrifice, utters his speech; thrice he utters 'Him'; verily thus he chooses the Udgatrs; the Agrayana is Prajapati; in that he utters 'Him' after taking the Agrayana, verily thus Prajapati sniffs offspring [3];

tasmā ukthyam eva prāyachat tasmai tṛtīyam ud ayachat taṃ viṣṇur anv atiṣṭhata jahīti so 'bravīt |	on him he bestowed again the Ukthya. At him he raised (the bolt) to hurl a third time; Visnu supported him (saying), 'Smite';

If he desire, 'May I bestow upon the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice', he should pour (it) down standing between the Sadas and the oblation-holder;

'The head of the sky, the messenger of earth', he says; verily he makes him the head of his equals. 'Vaiçvanara, born for holy order', he says, for life has Vaiçvanara as its deity.
ubhayatovaiśvānaro gṛhyate tasmād ubhayataḥ prāṇās |	therefore there are breaths on both sides, below and above.

The other cups are deposited on strewn (ground), the Dhruva on unstrewn; therefore in bone some creatures find support, in flesh others.
asurā vā uttarataḥ pṛthivīm paryācikīrṣan tāṃ devā dhruveṇādṛṃhan tad dhruvasya dhruvatvam |	The Asuras from above desired to turn round the earth; the gods made it firm (adrnhan) with the Dhruva; that is why the Dhruva has its name;

The Agrayana is Prajapati, the Upançu is the breath, the wives produce offspring; in that he draws (the cup) for (Tvastr) with the wives from the Agrayana with the Upançu-vessel, (it serves) for the production of offspring. Therefore offspring are born in accordance with the breath. The gods desired that the wives should go to the world of heaven [1];
lokam ajigāṃsan te suvargaṃ lokaṃ na prājānan ta etam pātnīvatam apaśyan tam agṛhṇata tato vai te suvargaṃ lokam prājānan yat pātnīvato gṛhyate suvargasya lokasya prajñātyai sa somo nātiṣṭhata strībhyo gṛhyamāṇas taṃ ghṛtaṃ vajraṃ kṛtvāghnan taṃ nirindriyam bhūtam agṛhṇan tasmāt striyo nirindriyā adāyādīr api pāpāt puṃsa upastitaram |	they could not discern the world of heaven, they saw this (cup) for the wives, they drew it; then indeed did they discern the world of heaven; in that (the cup) for the wives is drawn, (it serves) to reveal the world of heaven. Soma could not bear being drawn for women; making the ghee a bolt they beat it, they drew it when it had lost its power;
vadanti yad ghṛtena pātnīvataṃ śrīṇāti vajreṇaivainaṃ vaśe kṛtvā gṛhṇāti |	In that he mixes (the cup) for (Tvastr) with the wives with ghee, he overpowers it with a bolt and draws it.
upayāmagṛhīto 'sīty āha |	'Thou art taken with a support', he says;
iyaṃ vā upayāmas tasmād imām prajā anu pra jāyante bṛhaspatisutasya ta ity āha brahma vai devānām bṛhaspatis |	the support is this (earth); therefore offspring are born on this (earth). 'Of thee, pressed by Brhaspati ', he says; Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods;
brahmaṇaivāsmai prajāḥ pra janayati |	verily by the holy power he produces offspring for him.
indo ity āha reto vā indus |	'O drop', he says; the drop is seed;
reta eva tad dadhāti |	verily thus he impregnates seed.
indriyāva iti |	'Possessing power', he says [3];
āha prajā vā indriyam prajā evāsmai pra janayati |	power is offspring; verily he produces offspring for him.
agnā ity āha |	'O Agni', he says;
agnir vai retodhāḥ patnīva ity āha mithunatvāya sajūr devena tvaṣṭrā somam pibety āha tvaṣṭā vai paśūnām mithunānāṃ rūpakṛt |	the impregnator of seed is Agni; 'With the wives', he says, for pairing; 'in unison with the god Tvastr drink the Soma', he says; Tvastr is the maker of the forms of pairings of animals;
rūpam eva paśuṣu dadhāti devā vai tvaṣṭāram ajighāṃsan |	verily he places form in animals. The gods sought to slay Tvastr;
sa patnīḥ prāpadyata taṃ na prati prāyachan tasmād api |	he went to the wives, they would not give him up;
vadhyam prapannaṃ na prati pra yachanti tasmāt pātnīvate tvaṣṭtre 'pi gṛhyate na sādayati | asannād dhi prajāḥ prajāyante nānu vaṣaṭ karoti yad anuvaṣaṭkuryād rudram prajā anvavasṛjet |	Therefore in (the cup) for the wives for Tvastr also a drawing is made. He does not put (the cup) down, for from what is not depressed offspring are produced. He does not utter the secondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his offspring;
yan nānuvaṣaṭkuryād aśāntam agnīt somam bhakṣayet |	if he were not to do so, the Agnidh would consume the Soma before it had been appeased;
upāṃśv anu vaṣaṭ karoti na rudram prajā anvavasṛjati śāntam agnīt somam bhakṣayati |	he says the secondary Vasat muttering, he does not let Rudra go after his offspring, the Agnidh consumes the Soma after it has been appeased.
agnīn neṣṭur upastham ā sīda |	'O Agnidh, sit on the lap of the Nestr;
agnīd eva neṣṭari reto dadhāti neṣṭā patniyām udgātrā saṃ khyāpayati prajāpatir vā eṣa yad udgātā prajānām prajananāya |	O Nestr, lead up the wife', he says verily the Agnidh impregnates the Nestr, the Nestr the wife. He causes the Udgatr to look (at the wife); the Udgatr is Prajapati;
ūruṇopa pra vartayati |	He causes water to follow along;
ūruṇā hi retaḥ sicyate nagnaṃkriyorum upa pra vartayati yadā hi nagna ūrur bhavaty atha mithunī bhavatas | atha retaḥ sicyate | atha prajāḥ pra jāyante |	along the thigh he causes it to flow, for along the thigh is seed poured; baring the thigh he causes it to flow, for when the thigh is bared, they pair, then seed is poured, then offspring are born.
indro vṛtram ahan tasya śīrṣakapālam ud aubjat sa droṇakalaśo 'bhavat tasmāt somaḥ sam asravat sa hāriyojano 'bhavat taṃ vy acikitsat |	Indra slew Vrtra; he forced out his skull-bone, it became the wooden tub, from it the Soma flowed, it became (the cup) for the yoker of bays;
juhavānī mā hauṣām iti so 'manyata yad dhoṣyāmy āmaṃ hoṣyāmi yan na hoṣyāmi yajñaveśasaṃ kariṣyāmīti tam adhriyata hotum | so 'gnir abravīt |	he reflected regarding it, 'Shall I offer, or shall I not offer?' He reflected, 'If I shall offer, I shall offer what is raw; if I shall not offer, I shall make confusion in the sacrifice.' He decided to offer;
na mayy āmaṃ hoṣyasīti taṃ dhānābhir aśrīṇāt |	Agni said, Thou shalt not offer what is raw in me';
taṃ śṛtam bhūtam ajuhot yad dhānābhir hāriyojanaṃ śrīṇāti śṛtatvāya śṛtam evainam bhūtaṃ juhoti bahvībhiḥ śrīṇāti |	he mixed it with fried grains [1], and when it had become cooked he offered it. In that he mixes (the cup) for the yoker of bays with fried grains, (it serves) to make it cooked; verily he offers it when it has become cooked. He mixes with many;
etāvatīr evāsyāmuṣmiM loke kāmadughā bhavanti |	so many are his (cows) yielding his wishes in yonder world.
atho khalv āhus | etā vā indrasya pṛśnayaḥ kāmadughā yad dhāriyojanīr iti tasmād bahvībhiḥ śrīṇīyāt |	Or rather they say,'(The fried grains) for the yoker of bays are the dappled (cows) of Indra yielding wishes'; therefore he should mix with many.
ṛksāme vā indrasya harī somapānau tayoḥ paridhaya ādhānam |	The bays of Indra, which drink the Soma, are the Rc and the Saman, the enclosing-sticks are their bridles;
yad aprahṛtya paridhīñ juhuyād antarādhānābhyām |	if he should offer without removing the enclosing-sticks, he would offer fodder to them still bridled [2];
ghāsam pra yachet prahṛtya paridhīñ juhoti nirādhānābhyām eva ghāsam pra yachati |	he offers after removing the enclosing-sticks; verily he offers fodder to them with their bridles removed.
unnetā juhoti yātayāmeva hy etarhy adhvaryuḥ svagākṛtas |	It is the Unnetr who offers; the Adhvaryu when he has uttered 'Godspeed!' is as one who has finished his journey;
yad adhvaryur juhuyād yathā vimuktam punar yunakti tādṛg eva tat | śīrṣann adhinidhāya juhoti śīrṣato hi sa samabhavat |	if the Adhvaryu were to offer, it would be as when one yokes again (a horse) unyoked. He offers after putting it on his head, for from the head it sprung;
vikramya juhoti vikramya hīndro vṛtram ahan |	he offers after striding, for Indra slew Vrtra after striding;
yat sambhindyād alpāḥ |	(verily it serves) for attainment.
enam paśavo bhuñjanta upa tiṣṭheran yan na sambhindyād bahava enam paśavo 'bhuñjanta upa tiṣṭheran manasā sam bādhate |	if he were to crush (them), few [3] cattle would attend and wait on him; if he were not to crush them, many cattle would attend, but not wait on him;
ubhayaṃ karoti bahava evainam paśavo bhuñjanta upa tiṣṭhante |	in his mind he crushes them together, and effects both; many cattle attend and wait on him.

Offspring and cattle are born through the cups, goats and sheep through the Upançu and Antaryama, men through the Çukra and Manthin, whole-hooved animals through the season-cups, kine through the Aditya cup.
ādityagraho bhūyiṣṭhābhir ṛgbhir gṛhyate tasmād gāvaḥ paśūnām bhūyiṣṭhās |	The Aditya cup is drawn with the largest number of Rcs; therefore kine axe the most numerous of cattle;
yat trir upāṃśuṃ hastena vigṛhṇāti tasmād dvau trīn ajā janayaty athāvayo bhūyasīḥ pitā vā eṣa yad āgrayaṇaḥ putraḥ kalaśas |	in that he thrice draws apart with his hand the Upançu (cup), therefore the female goat gives birth to two or three, but sheep are more numerous. The Agrayana is the father, the tub is the son;
yad āgrayaṇa upadasyet kalaśād gṛhṇīyāt |	if the Agrayana is exhausted, he should draw from the tub;
yathā pitā | putraṃ kṣita upadhāvati tādṛg eva tat |	that is as when a father [1] in destitution has recourse to his son.

sthālyā gṛhṇāti vāyavyena juhoti tasmāt |	he draws with a pot, he offers with (the vessel) for Vayu;
garbheṇāvijñātena brahmahā |	therefore [2] (a man) is a slayer of a Brahman (through slaying) an embryo which has not been discriminated.
avabhṛtham ava yanti parā sthālīr asyanty ud vāyavyāni haranti tasmāt striyaṃ jātām parāsyanty ut pumāṃsaṃ haranti yat purorucam āha yathā vasyasa āharati tādṛg eva tat |	They go to the final bath; they deposit the pots, but lift up (the vessels) for Vayu; therefore they deposit a daughter on birth, a son they lift up.

Some vessels are used repeatedly, others not. Through those which are used once only the wild animals go to the forest; through those which are used again the domestic animals come back again to the village. He who knows the foundation of the cups becomes possessed of a (sure) foundation.
ājyam ity ukthaṃ tad vai grahāṇāṃ nidānam |	The hymn called the Ajya (Çastra), that is the foundation of the cups;
yad upāṃśu śaṃsati tat | upāṃśvantaryāmayos | yad uccais tad itareṣāṃ grahāṇām etad vai grahāṇāṃ nidānam |	in that he recites muttering, that [2] is (the foundation) of the Upançu and the Antaryama (cups); in that (he recites) aloud, that is (the foundation) of the other cups;

The theologians say, 'Neither by Rc nor by Saman is the five made up; what then is the fivefold character of the sacrifice?' Fried grains, mush, rice grains, the cake, clotted milk, thereby the five is made up;

He sets up the sacrificial post; verily gathering together a threefold bolt he hurls it at his foe, to lay him low. If he were to set it up within the altar, he would win the world of the gods; if outside the altar, the world of men;

If he desire of a man, 'Be a girl born to him', he should intertwine (the girdles) near the ends; verily a girl is born to him; if he desire of a man, 'Be a son born to him', he should cover it round right up to the end;

In that the Upaçaya lies near (upaçáye) on the south, (it serves) to drive away the foe. All the other posts have victims (attached), the Upaçaya has none, its victim is the sacrificer; if he were not to indicate (a victim), the sacrificer would be ruined.

He who has attained (power) is banished, he who is banished returns (to power). If he desire, 'May the people fall into confusion', he should interchange the animals;

If he should offer that to Varuna along the stream of the waters, Varuna would seize his offspring; he offers (the victim) facing north on the south side against the stream of the waters, to prevent Varuna seizing his offspring. Indra caused Manu to sacrifice with his wife; after she had been encircled with fire he let her go;

The offering of the caul [1] has been performed, the offering of the cow is not yet over, then he performs (the offering) (for Tvastr) with the wives; verily he performs it at the right moment;
iṣṭaṃ vapayā |	It is for Tvastr;

Having made it full all round, he should look at (it), for in it he sees himself; verily also he purifies himself. He whose mind is gone should look at (it), (saying), 'That mind of mine which hath gone away, or which hath gone elsewhere, by means of King Soma, we keep within us';
na gatamanā bhavati |	verily he keeps his mind in himself [2], his mind is not gone.

The theologians say, 'Mitra appropriates the well-performed part of the sacrifice, Varuna the ill-performed; where then is the sacrifice, and where the sacrificer?;
yajñasya sviṣṭaṃ śamayati varuṇena duriṣṭaṃ nārtim ārchati yajamānas |	In that he offers a cow to Mitra and Varuna, by Mitra [3] he propitiates the well-performed part of the sacrifice, by Varuna the ill-performed; the sacrificer is not ruined.

The metres of him who has sacrificed are worn out, the cow is the sap of the metres; in that he offers the cow to Mitra and Varuna, he again delights the metres, to drive away weariness; verily also he bestows sap upon the metres.

Prajapati indicated the sacrifices to the gods, he put away their dear forms, they became the Atigrahya; 'Bodiless is his sacrifice', they say, 'for whom the Atigrahyas are not drawn.' They should be drawn also in the Agnistoma, so that the sacrifice may have its body. All the deities were alike, and were not discriminated;

aruṇapiśaṃgo 'śvo dakṣiṇā |	The sacrificial fee is a reddish-brown horse;
tad vai vajrasya rūpam |	that is the form of the bolt;
samṛddhyai |	(verily it serves) for success.
prajananaṃ jyotir agnir devatānāṃ jyotir virāṭ chandasāṃ jhotis |	Agni is the light of the gods; the Viraj is the light of the metres. The Viraj of speech ends in Agni;
virāḍ vāco 'gnau saṃ tiṣṭhate virājam abhi sam padyate tasmāt taj jyotir ucyate dvau stomau prātaḥsavanaṃ vahato yathā prāṇaś cāpānaś ca dvau mādhyaṃdinaṃ savanaṃ yathā cakṣuś ca śrotraṃ ca dvau tṛtīyasavanaṃ yathā vāk ca pratiṣṭhā ca puruṣasammito vā eṣa yajño 'sthūriḥ |	Therefore it is called light. Two Stomas bear the morning pressing, like expiration and inspiration; two the midday pressing, like eye and ear; two the third pressing, like speech and support. This sacrifice is commensurate with man, and is perfect [1].
yaṃ kāmaṃ kāmayate tam etenābhy aśnute sarvaṃ hy asthuriṇābhyaśnute |	Whatever desire a man has, he wins by it, for one wins all by that which is perfect.

When he grasped them the mule escaped. Following it he took its seed, and placed it in the ass.
vaḍabāyāṃ ny amārḍ iti tasmād vaḍabā dviretās | atho āhus |	Therefore the ass has double seed. They also say, 'He placed it in the mare.' Therefore the mare has double seed.
oṣadhīṣu |	They also say, 'In the plants [2] he placed it.' Therefore plants, though not anointed, glisten.' They also say, 'He placed it in offspring.' Therefore twins are born.
ny amārḍ iti tasmād oṣadhayo 'nabhyaktā rebhanti |	Therefore the mule has no offspring, for his seed has been taken from him.
atho āhuḥ prajāsu ny amārḍ iti tasmād yamau jāyete tasmād aśvataro na pra jāyata āttaretā hi tasmād barhiṣy anavaklptaḥ sarvavedase vā sahasre vāvaklptas |	Therefore he is not suitable for the sacrifice, but is suitable if there is a sacrifice when one gives (to the priests) all one's goods or a thousand, for he escaped.
ati hy apravata ya evaṃ vidvān agniṣṭomena yajate prājātāḥ prajā janayati pari prajātā gṛhṇāti tasmād āhus | jyeṣṭhayajña iti |	He who knowing thus sacrifices with the Agnistoma begets unborn offspring and grasps those that are born. Therefore they say, 'It is the best of sacrifices [3].' Prajapati indeed is the best, for he sacrificed with it first.
prajāpatir vāva jyeṣṭhaḥ sa hy etenāgre 'yajata prajāpatir akāmayata pra jāyeyeti sa mukhatas trivṛtaṃ nir amimīta tam agnir devatānv asṛjyata gāyatrī chando rathaṃtaraṃ sāma brāhmaṇo manuṣyāṇām ajaḥ paśūnām |	Prajapati desired, 'May I have offspring.' He meted out the Trivrt from his mouth. After it the god Agni was created, the Gayatri metre, the Rathantara Saman, of men the Brahman, of cattle the goat;
tasmāt te mukhyās | mukhato hy asṛjyanta |	therefore are they the chief, for they were produced from the mouth.
uraso bāhubhyām pañcadaśaṃ nir amimīta tam indro devatānv asṛjyata triṣṭup chando bṛhat | sāma rājanyo manuṣyāṇām aviḥ paśūnām |	From the breast and arms he meted out the Pañcadaça Stoma. After it the god Indra was created, the Tristubh metre, the Brhat [4] Saman, of men the Rajanya, of cattle the sheep.
tasmāt te vīryāvantas |	There fore they are strong, for they were created from strength.
vīryād dhy asṛjyanta madhyataḥ saptadaśaṃ nir amimīta taṃ viśve devā devatā anv asṛjyanta jagatī chando vairūpaṃ sāma vaiśyo manuṣyāṇāṃ gāvaḥ paśūnām |	From the middle he meted out the Saptadaça Stoma. After it the All-gods as deities were created, the Jagati metre, the Vairupa Saman, of men the Vaiçya, of cattle cows.
tasmāt ta ādyās | annadhānād dhy asṛjyanta tasmād bhūyāṃso 'nyebhyas |	Therefore are they to be eaten, for they were created from the receptacle of food.
bhūyiṣṭhā hi devatā anv asṛjyanta patta ekaviṃśaṃ nir amimīta tam anuṣṭup chandaḥ |	Therefore are they more numerous than others, for they were created after the most numerous of the gods. From his feet he meted out the Ekavinça Stoma.
anv asṛjyata vairājaṃ sāma śūdro manuṣyāṇām aśvaḥ paśūnām |	After it the Anustubh metre [5] was created, the Vairaja Saman, of men the Çudra, of cattle the horse.

Therefore the Çudra is not fit for the sacrifice, for he was not created after any gods. Therefore they depend on their feet, for they were created from the feet. The Trivrt is the breaths;
ardhamāsāḥ pañcadaśaḥ prajāpatiḥ saptadaśas traya ime lokās |	the Pañcadaça the half-months; the Saptadaça Prajapati; these worlds are three;
asāv āditya ekaviṃśas |	the Ekavinça is the sun yonder.
etasmin vā ete śritā etasmin pratiṣṭhitās |	In this they rest, in this they find support.

As many as are the Stomas, so many are desires, so many the worlds, so many the lights; verily so many Stomas, so many desires, so many worlds, so many lights does he win.

If they omit the Trivrt Stoma, then his vital airs are omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, 'May it be in my vital airs. If they omit the Pañcadaça Stoma, his strength is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, 'May it be in my strength.' If they omit the Saptadaça Stoma [1], his offspring is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, 'May it be in my offspring.' If they omit the Ekavinça Stoma, his support is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, 'May it be in my support.' If they omit the Trinava Stoma, his seasons and the strength of the Naksatras are omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, 'May it be in my seasons and the strength of the Naksatras' [2].

He who knows the lowest of the Stomas attaining the first place, obtains him self the first place. The Trivrt is the lowest of Stomas, the Trivrt occupies the first place. He who know thus obtains the first place.
aṅgiraso vai sattram āsata te suvargaṃ lokam āyan teṣāṃ haviṣmāṃś ca haviṣkṛc cāhīyetām |	The Ahina Sacrifices The Angirases performed a sacrificial session. They went to the world of heaven.

suvargaṃ lokam iyāveti tāv etaṃ dvirātram apaśyatām | tam āharatām | tenāyajetām |	They desired, 'May we two go to the world of heaven.' They two saw this two-night rite, they grasped it, and sacrificed with it.

The first day is the Jyotistoma form of the Agnistoma; with it he wins splendour. The second day is an Atiratra with all the Stomas, that he may obtain all and win all. On the first day the Saman is in the Gayatri (metre).

They say, 'Where are the Jagati and the Anustubh?' On the first day the Saman is that of Vikhanas; verily he does not leave the Jagati. On the second it is the Sodaçin;
athāhus |	verily he does not leave the Anustubh.
yat samāne 'rdhamāse syātām anyatarasyāhno vīryam anu padyeteti | amāvāyāyām pūrvam ahar bhavaty uttarasminn uttaram |	Then they say, 'If the days fall in the same half month, then the strength of one day only will belong to the rite.' The first day takes place on the night of new moon;
nānaivārdhamāsayor bhavatas | nānāvīrye bhavatas |	the second on the next day, verily the days fall on separate half-months, and have the several strengths.
haviṣmannidhanam pūrvam ahar bhavati haviṣkṛnnidhanam uttaram pratiṣṭhityai |	The first day has Havismant, the second Haviskrt in the finale, for support.

In it Prajapati becoming the wind moved. He saw her, and becoming a boar he seized her. Her, becoming Viçvakarma, he wiped. She extended, she became the earth, and hence the earth is called the earth (lit.

He produced the gods, Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. The gods said to Prajapati, 'Let us have offspring.' He said [1], 'As I have created you by penance, so seek ye offspring in penance.' He gave to them Agni as a support, saying, 'Strive with that support.' They strove with Agni as a support.
etenāyatanena śrāmyateti te 'gnināyatanenāśrāmyan te saṃvatsara ekāṃ gām asṛjanta tāṃ vasubhyo rudrebhya ādityebhyaḥ prāyachan |	After a year they produced one cow. They gave it to the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas, saying 'Guard it.' The Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas guarded it.

atha saiva sahasratamy abhavat te devāḥ prajāpatim abruvan |	The gods said to Prajapati, 'Cause sacrifice to be made to us with a thousand.' He caused sacrifice to be made by the Vasus with the Agnistoma.
sahasreṇa no yājayeti so 'gniṣṭomena vasūn ayājayat ta imaṃ lokam ajayan tac cādaduḥ sa ukthyena rudrān ayājayat te 'ntarikṣam ajayan tac cādaduḥ so 'tirātreṇādityān ayājayat te 'muṃ lokam ajayan tac cādadus tad antarikṣam |	They won this world and gave (the thousandth). He caused sacrifice to be made by the Rudras with the Ukthya. They won the atmosphere and gave (the thousand). He caused sacrifice to be made by the Adityas with the Atiratra. They won yonder world, and gave (the thousand).
vyavairyata tasmād rudrā ghātukās |	Therefore the Rudras are murderous, for they have no support.

The Ajya (Çastra) of the midmost day is in the Tristubh metre. He recites the Samyana hymns, then recites the Sodaçin, that the day may be made firm and be not loose.
ahno dhṛtyā aśithilambhāvāya tasmāt trirātrasyāgniṣṭoma eva prathamam ahaḥ syād athokthyo 'thātirātras |	Therefore in the three-night rite, the first day should be an Agnistoma, then an Ukthya, then an Atiratra, for the separation of these worlds.

atha yā sahasratamī sā hotre deyeti hotāraṃ vā abhyatiricyate yad atiricyate hotānāptasyāpayitā | athāhus |	Now (some say), 'The thousandth is to be given to the Hotr'; what is left over, is left over for the Hotr; the Hotr is the receiver of what has not been taken.
unnetre deyeti | atiriktā vā eṣā sahasrasya | atirikta unnetartvijām athāhuḥ sarvebhyaḥ sadasyebhyo deyeti | athāhus |	Then others say, 'It is to be given to the Unnetr.' This is left over of the thousand, and the Unnetr is the one of the priests who is left over.

sahasraṃ stotrīyāḥ sahasraṃ dakṣiṇāḥ sahasrasammitaḥ suvargo lokaḥ suvargasya lokasyābhijityai |	There are a thousand Stotriyas, a thousand gifts (to the priests); the world of heaven is measured by thousand;
somo vai sahasram avindat tam indro 'nv avindat tau yamo nyāgachat tāv abravīt |	(verily it serves) for the winning of the heavenly world. Soma found a thousand; Indra discovered it after him.
astu me 'trāpīti | astu hī ity abrūtām | sa yama ekasyāṃ vīryam pary apaśyat |	Yama approached them and said to them, 'May I have a share too in it.' They said to him, 'Be it so.' Yama saw in one of the (cows) strength.

pari paśyāmo 'ṃśam ā harāmahā iti tasyām aṃśam āharanta tām apsu prāveśayan |	Let us each have a portion.' So they took shares in the one.
somāyodehīti sā rohiṇī piṅgalaikahāyanī rūpaṃ kṛtvā trayastriṃśatā ca tribhiś ca śataiḥ sahodait |	They put her into the waters, saying, 'Come out for Soma.' She came out in the shape of a red brown cow of one year old, together with three hundred and thirty three.
tasmād rohiṇyā piṅgalayaikahāyanyā somaṃ krīṇīyāt |	Therefore let one buy the Soma with a red brown cow one year old.

She came out in the shape of a red draught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes, together with three hundred and thirty-three.

She came out in the shape of an aged, stupid, utterly bad animal, together with three hundred and thirty-three. Therefore one should offer as the funeral cow one that is aged, stupid, utterly bad. If a man knowing thus offers a cow that is aged, stupid, utterly bad, as the funeral cow, she becomes for him in yonder world three hundred and thirty-three. Speech is the thousandth.
varo deyaḥ sā hi varaḥ sahasram asya sā dattā bhavati tasmād varo na pratigṛhyaḥ sā hi varaḥ sahasram asya pratigṛhītam bhavati |	Therefore [4] a boon must be given; for she is a boon, and when she is given she is a thousand.

ubhayataenī syāt tad āhus |	She should be spotted on either side.
anyataenī syāt sahasram parastād etam iti yaiva varaḥ |	spotted is the thousand on the other side.' The one for a boon [5] should be beautiful, perfect in form; for she is a boon;
kalyāṇī rūpasamṛddhā sā syāt sā hi varaḥ samṛddhyai tām uttareṇāgnīdhram paryāṇīyāhavanīyasyānte droṇakalaśam ava ghrāpayet |	Leading her round to the north of the Agnidh's place he makes her smell the wooden tub near the Ahavaniya fire, saying, 'Smell the tub, O great one, with broad stream rich in milk;

Verily he unites him with offspring, with cattle, with wealth [6].
ardhayati prajāvān paśumān rayimān bhavati ya evaṃ veda tayā sahāgnīdhram paretya purastāt pratīcyāṃ tiṣṭhantyāṃ juhuyāt |	He becomes rich in offspring, in cattle, in wealth, who knows thus.

So he, who on this tenth day, the Avivakya, comes to grief, is left out. If one points out (an error) to one who comes to grief, he seizes hold of him and comes out successfully, and then the one who pointed out (his error) is left out [1].
hīyate tasmād daśame 'hann avivākya upahatāya na vyucyam atho khalv āhur yajñasya vai samṛddhena devāḥ suvargaṃ lokam āyan yajñasya vyṛddhenāsurān parābhāvayann iti yat khalu vai yajñasya samṛddhaṃ tad yajamānasya yad vyṛddhaṃ tad bhrātṛvyasya sa yo vai daśame 'hann avivākya upahanyate sa evāti recayati te ye bāhyā dṛśīkavaḥ |	Therefore on the tenth day, the Avivakya, one should not point out (errors) to one who comes to grief. Or rather they say, 'By that which was successful in the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, and overcame the Asuras by what was unsuccessful.' What is successful in the sacrifice belongs to the sacrificer, what is unsuccessful to his enemy. Now he, who comes to grief on the tenth day, the Avivakya, produces overmuch.
syus te vi brūyus |	Those who are outside as spectators [2] should point out (his error).
yadi tatra na vindeyur antaḥsadasād vyucyam |	If there be none there, then (the error) should be pointed out from within the Sadas.

They sing these (verses) with the mind. Neither a horse chariot nor a mule chariot can in one moment encompass this (earth), but mind can in one moment encompass it, mind can overcome it. Then they repeat the Brahman. The Rc verses are limited, the Samans are limited, and the Yajuses are limited, but of the Brahman there is no end, and that he should declare to the one who responds.

'Brilliance and power' is (the answer). 'What by the second?' 'The breaths and food.' 'What by the third?' 'These three worlds.' 'What by the fourth?' 'Four-footed cattle.' 'What by the fifth?' 'The Pankti with its elements.' 'What by the sixth?' 'The six seasons.' 'What by the seventh?' 'The Çakvari with its seven feet.' 'What by the eighth?' 'The Gayatri with its eight syllables.' 'What by the ninth?' 'The Trivrt Stoma.' 'What by the tenth?' 'The Viraj with its ten syllables.' 'What by the eleventh?' 'The Tristubh with its eleven syllables.' 'What by the twelfth?' 'The Jagati with its twelve syllables.' So much is there as that.

They would cleave it if they put an Atiratra in the middle, and the speech of the householder would be liable to fail.' They perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas; verily they maintain the sequence of speech, and the speech of the householder is not likely to fail.
yad upariṣṭāc chandomānām mahāvrataṃ kurvanti paśuṣu caivānnādye ca prati tiṣṭhanti |	in that they perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas, they find support in cattle and in food.

They saw this (rite) of fourteen nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed they prospered in both worlds, this and yonder. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fourteen nights, prosper in both worlds, this and yonder. (The rite) is of fourteen nights, there are seven domesticated plants and seven wild;

The year is the cows' Sattra [1], and those who knowing thus perform the year (sacrifice) are prosperous.

chandāṃsy eva tad vimokaṃ yanti |	It is the releasing; verily the metres are released;
atho ubhayatojyotiṣaiva ṣaḍahena suvargaṃ lokaṃ yanti brahmavadino vadanti |	verily also they go to the world of heaven with the six-day (rite) which has a Jyotistoma on either side.

The Gayatri is the Jyotistoma, the Tristubh, the Gostoma, the Jagati the Ayustoma. In that there are these Stomas, so do they go by the path that leads to the gods [5].
tat pathā yanti samānaṃ sāma bhavati devaloko vai sāma devalokād eva na yanti |	There is used the same Saman. The Saman is the world of the gods; verily they leave not the world of the gods.

There is the Viçvajit (day) for the gaining of all. Month by month they perform the Prsthas, month by month the Atigrahyas are drawn; verily in each month they place strength, for the support of the months.
upariṣṭān māsām pṛṣṭhāny upa yanti tasmād upariṣṭād oṣadhayaḥ phalaṃ gṛhṇanti |	They perform the Prsthas in the latter part of the month. Therefore it is on the top that the plants bear fruit.

But others said, either half of them or as many as might be the case, 'Let us perform (the rite) for these months, the eleventh and the twelfth, and when we have made up the year, let us cease' [1].

They go by their feet, and he who goes by his foot attains (what he seeks).
tasmād etad gosani |	The Ayana is successful, and therefore is it productive of cows.
prathame māsi pṛṣṭhāny upa yanti madhyama upa yanty uttama upa yanti tad āhus |	They perform the Prahas in the first month, they perform them in the middle month, they perform them in the last month.

Having made up the year, they should perform the Prsthas once in the last month; verily the sacrificers win the sacrifice and cattle.
ete 'navāram apāram pra plavante ye saṃvatsaram upayanti yad bṛhadrathaṃtare anvarjeyur yathā madhye samudrasya plavam anvarjeyus tādṛk tat |	It is an ocean [1] without a near or a further shore that they enter upon who perform the year (rite). If they employ the Brhat and the Rathantara Samans, it would be as if they were to provide a boat in the middle of the ocean.
anutsargam bṛhadrathaṃtarābhyām itvā pratiṣṭhāṃ gachanti sarvebhyo vai kāmebhyaḥ saṃdhir duhe tad yajamānāḥ sarvān kāmān ava rundhate |	Going continuously with the Brhat and the Rathantara they obtain support. The union is milked for all desires; thus the sacrificers obtain all desires.

They first use the Jagati, and the metres descend from the Jagati, the cups from the Agrayana, the Prsthas from the Brhat, the Stomas from the Trayastrinça. Therefore the younger descends before an elder. The Viçvakarman cup is drawn; verily by it the sacrificers win all rites.

Whatever in the sacrifice is redundant, is redundant with regard to Visnu Çipivista; verily Visnu Çipivista places the redundant in the redundant.
