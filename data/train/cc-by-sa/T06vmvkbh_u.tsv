tatrāditaḥ śāstraśarīraṃ vyavasthāpyate / lakṣaṇaṃ hy āvṛtis tatvaṃ pratipakṣasya bhāvanā / tatra ca sthā phalaprāptir yānānuttaryam eva ca //	Here, at first, a framework for the Treatise has been arranged as follows: "Characteristics, obstructions, realities, the cultivation of antidotes, situations there, the attainment of fruition, and the supremacy of the Vehicle" I.
ity ete saptārthā hy asmiṃ cchāstre upadiśyante / yad uta lakṣaṇaṃ āvaraṇaṃ tatvaṃ pratipakṣasya bhāvanā / tasyām eva ca pratipakṣabhāvanāyām avasthā phalaprāptiś ca yānānuttatyañ ca saptamo 'rthaḥ /	la That is to say that the following seven topics are dealt with in the Treatise the main characteristics , their obstructions, realities, the cultivation of antidotes to the obstructions, situations which may arise in this cultivation of antidotes, the attainment of fruition there, and a path to the attainment of fruition, a path having no superior.
tatra lakṣaṇam ārabhyāha / abhūtaparikalpo 'sti dvayan tatra na vidyate /	Referring to the characteristics, the author says: "There is the construction of that which was not; duality is not found there;
śūnyatā vidyate tv atra tasyām api sa vidyate //	But emptiness is found there; And "he" is found in "Her", as well.".
tatrābhūtaparikalpo grāhyagrāhakavikalpaḥ /	In this passage, "the construction of that which was not" is the discrimination of object apprehended and subject apprehendor .
śūnyatā tasyābhūtaparikalpasya grāhyagrāhakabhāvena virahitatā /	And “Emptiness" is the separation of the construction of that which was not from the being of object apprehended and subject apprehendor.
tasyām api sa vidyata ity abhūtaparikalpaḥ /	"And 'he' is found Maitreyanātha, author of The Separation of the Middle from Extremes, to which this work by asubandhu is a commentary.
evaṃ yad yatra nāsti tat tena śūnyam iti yathābhūtaṃ samanupaśyati yat punar atrāvaśiṣṭaṃ	And if it is not there in that way, then, as a result, one sees "as it is", namely, that it is empty.

na śūnyaṃ śūnyatayā cābhūtaparikalpena ca /	It is not empty, either because of emptiness or the construction of that which was not.
na cāśūnyaṃ dvayena grāhyena grāhakeṇa ca / sarvaṃ saṃskṛtaṃ cābhūtaparikalpākhyaṃ /	Neither is it non-empty, because of the duality, object apprehended and subject apprehendor, and thus it has been taught, that "Everything compounded is called 'the construction of that which was not';

yat sarvaṃ / naikāntena śūnyaṃ naikāntenāśūnyaṃ /	And this is the Middle Path : that everything is neither totally empty nor totally non-empty.

Having explained the existent character and the non-existent character of the construction of that which was not, he next explains its own-characteristic.
svalakṣaṇaṃ khyāpayati / arthasatvātmavijñaptipratibhāsaṃ prajāyate /	"Consciousness arises as the appearance of objects of the senses and of understanding, and as the appearance of sentient beings, self, and perceptions.

tatrārthapratibhāsaṃ yad rūpādibhāvena pratibhāsate /	In this passage, the appearance of objects of senses and understanding is that which appears because of the being of cf. Kausika-prajñā-pārumitā-sūtra visibles, etc.
satvapratibhāsaṃ yat pañcendriyatvena svaparasantānayor ātmapratibhāsaṃ kliṣṭaṃ manaḥ / ātmamohādisaṃprayogāt /	The appearance of sentient beings is that which appears because of there being sense-faculties in "one's own" and "others"" life-streams. The appearance of self is afflicted manas, because of its association with confusion of self, etc.
vijñaptipratibhāsaṃ ṣaḍ vijñānāni nāsti cāsyārtha iti /	The appearance of perceptions is the taking shape of the six consciousnesses.
arthasatvapratibhāsasyānākāratvāt / ātmavijñaptipratibhāsasya ca vitathapratibhāsatvāt /	"There is no object for it", the author says, because of the lack of a fixed aspect in the appearance of objects and sentient beings, and because of the false appearance of the appearance of self and perceptions.
tadabhāvāt tad apy asad iti /	"In its nonbeing, it itself is not", the author says;
yat tadgrāhyaṃ rūpādipañcendriyaṃ manaḥ ṣaḍvijñānasaṃjñakaṃ caturvidhaṃ tasya grāhyasyārthasyābhāvāt tad api grāhakaṃ vijñānam asat / abhūtaparikalpatvaṃ siddham asya bhavaty ataḥ / na tathā sarvathābhāvāt /	because of the non-being, in these four ways, of the object apprehended, i.e. visibles, etc., the five sense-faculties, manas, and the six consciousnesses which cognize, the apprehendor, consciousness, is also non-existent.³ "Consciousness' character as the construction of that which was not is demonstrated by its being, because it is not in that way, and yet is not totally non-being.".

Furthermore, it couldn't be simply non-being, because, "Liberation through its extinction is accepted." .b Otherwise, bondage and freedom would be contradicted, and this would incur the flaw of denying affliction and alleviation.
evam abhūtaparikalpasya svalakṣaṇaṃ khyāpayitvā saṃgrahalakṣaṇaṃ khyāpayati /	Having explained the own-characteristic of the construction of that which was not in this way, the author proceeds to explain its comprising characteristic.
abhūtaparikalpamātre sati yathā trayāṇāṃ svabhāvānāṃ saṃgraho bhavati / kalpitaḥ paratantraś ca pariniṣpanna eva ca / arthād abhūtakalpāc ca dvayābhāvāc ca deśitaḥ //	Even though this is only construction of that which was not, there comes to be a comprising of three own-beings in this way: "The constructed, the interdependent, and the fulfilled are indicated by objects of sense and understanding, the construction of that which was not, and the non-being of dualities.".
arthaḥ parikalpitaḥ svabhāvaḥ /	"Objects of sense and understanding" are constructed own-being.
abhūtaparikalpaḥ paratantraḥ svabhāvaḥ /	The construction of that which was not is interdependent ownbeing.
grāhyagrāhakābhāvaḥ pariniṣpannaḥ svabhāvaḥ / idānīṃ tasminn evābhūtaparikalpe 'sallakṣaṇānupraveśopāyalakṣaṇaṃ paridīpayati /	The non-being of object apprehended and subject apprehendor is fulfilled own-being. Next the author illuminates the characteristic within that construction of that which was not, allowing it to penetrate its own non-existent character.
upalabdhiṃ samāśritya nopalabdhiḥ prajāyate / nopalabdhiṃ samāśritya nopalabdhiḥ prajāyate //	"A non-apprehension comes about dependent on apprehension, a non-apprehension comes about dependent on this non-apprehension”.
vijñaptimātropalabdhiṃ niśrityārthānupalabdhir jāyate / arthānupalabdhiṃ niśritya vijñaptimātrasyāpy anupalabdhir jāyate /	A non-apprehension of objects as separate objects of sense and understanding comes about dependent on the apprehension that everything is perception-only. Accordingly, a non-apprehension of "perception-only" comes about dependent on this non-apprehension of objects.
evam asallakṣaṇaṃ grāhyagrāhakayoḥ praviśati /	And thus one enters into the nonexistent character of object apprehended and subject apprehendor.
upalabdhes tataḥ siddhā nopalabdhisvabhāvatā / upalabhyārthābhāve upalabdhyayogāt /	I.a because of the impossibility of a true apprehension with the non-being of a separate object for apprehension.
tasmāc ca samatā jñeyā nopalambhopalambhayoḥ //	"Because of this, it can be known that there is an identity between apprehension and non-apprehension.' .b Because of the inability to demonstrate an apprehension through its apprehenending anything.
upalabdher upalabdhitvenāsiddhatvād abhūtārthapratibhāsatayā tūpalabdhir ity ucyate 'nupalabdhisvabhāvāpi satī	Nevertheless, it is called "apprehension" because of the appearance of objects of sense and understanding which were not previously, even though it really has the nature of a non-apprehension.
tasyaivedānīm abhūtaparikalpasya prabhedalakṣaṇaṃ khyāpayati /	Next, the author explains the construction of that which was not's characteristic of being divided.
abhūtaparikalpaś ca cittacaittās tridhātukāḥ /	"And the construction of that which was not is the cittas and caittas of the three three realms."a.
kāmarūpārūpyāvacarabhedena / paryāyalakṣaṇaṃ ca khyāpayati / tatrārthadṛṣṭir vijñānaṃ tadviśeṣe tu caitasāḥ //	That is to say, it exists with the division of experience into the realm of desires, the realm of simple images, and the imageless realm. And then he explains the characteristics of its synonyms: "Observing an object there, is consciousness;
tatrārthamātre dṛṣṭir vijñānaṃ /	b That is to say: Observing in terms of "a simple object" is a consciousness;
arthaviśeṣe dṛṣṭiś caitasā vedanādayaḥ /	observing in terms of special qualities "in the object", are the caittas , such as feelings, etc.
pravṛttilakṣaṇaṃ ca khyāpayati / ekaṃ pratyayavijñānaṃ dvitīyam aupabhogikaṃ /	Then the author explains the construction of that which was not's characteristic of evolving : "One is the condition-consciousness, the second relates to experience;
upabhogaparicchedaprerakās tatra caitasāḥ //	in the latter are the caittas that experience, distinguish, and impel." I.
ālayavijñānam anyeṣāṃ vijñānānāṃ pratyayatvāt pratyayavijñānaṃ /	Because the store-consciousness is the conditional ground for all the other consciousnesses, it is the "condition-consciousness".
tatpratyayaṃ pravṛttivijñānam aupabhogikaṃ /	Conditioned by it, there are the evolving consciousnesses which relate to experience.
upabhogo vedanā / paricchedaḥ saṃjñā / prerakāḥ saṃskārā vijñānasya cetanāmanaskārādayaḥ /	Experiencing itself is basically feeling, distinguishing is cognition, and the impellers of consciousness are the motivating dispositions : volition, mental attention, etc.
saṃkleśalakṣaṇaṃ ca khyāpayati/	Then the author proceeds to discuss the construction of that which was not's characteristic of having afflictions.
chādanād ropaṇāc caiva nayanāt saṃparigrahāt / pūraṇāt triparicchedād upabhogāc ca karṣaṇāt //	"Because of concealment, planting, conducting, and holding fast; because of filling up, the triple distinguishing, experiencing, being pulled along;
nibandhanād ābhimukhyād duḥkhanāt kliśyate jagat /	because of binding, confrontation, and the more palpable states causing suffering, the living world is afflicted." I.
tatra cchādanād avidyayā yathābhūtadarśanavibandhanāt /	In this passage, "concealment" means the obstruction to seeing as it is which arises through ignorance;
ropaṇāt saṃskārair vijñāne karmavāsanāyāḥ pratiṣṭhāpanāt / nayanād vijñānenopapattisthānasaṃprāpaṇāt / saṃparigrahān nāmarūpeṇātmabhāvasya / pūraṇāt ṣaḍāyatanena / triparicchedāt sparśena /	"planting" means the setting up of latent karmic impressions in consciousness by the motivating dispositions, "conducting" means meeting with a situation for the further arising in consciousness, "holding fast" is the holding fast to a “self-being" through the psychophysical complex, "filling up" is the filling up by the six sense-fields, the "triple distinguishing" is the triple determination , "experiencing" is feeling, "being pulled along" is craving, conducive to being-again, projected by action, "binding" is being bound by desires, etc.
upabhogād vedanayā /	which are conducive to the arising of consciousnesses through clingings;
ābhimukhyād bhavena kṛtasya karmaṇaḥ punarbhave vipākadānāyābhimukhīkaraṇāt / duḥkhanāj jātyā jarāmaraṇena ca parikliśyate jagat / so 'yaṃ /	"confrontation" is the direction of a done act which gives retribution in a being-again, and the more palpable states causing suffering come about through birth, decrepitude, dying, etc. The living world is afflicted by all of these.
tredhā dvedhā ca saṃkleśaḥ saptadhābhūtakalpanāt //	"Threefold, twofold, and sevenfold affliction-together, because of the construction of that which was not." I.
tredhā saṃkleśaḥ / kleśasaṃkleśaḥ karmasaṃkleśaḥ janmasaṃkleśaś ca /	b Affliction-together is threefold: the affliction-together of afflictions proper, the afflictions-together of action, and the afflictionstogether of birth.
tatra kleśasaṃkleśo 'vidyātṛṣṇopādānāni / karmasaṃkleśaḥ saṃskārā bhavaś ca / janmasaṃkleśaḥ śeṣāṇy aṅgāni /	Among these, ignorances, craving, and clinging are afflictions-together of afflictions proper, motivating dispositions and being are the afflictions-together of action, and the afflictions-together of birth are the rest of the limbs of dependent origination.
dvedhā saṃkleśaḥ / hetusaṃkleśaḥ phalasaṃkleśaś ca /	Afflictions-together are twofold: causal and resultant.
tatra hetusaṃkleśaḥ kleśakarmasvabhāvair aṅgaiḥ phalasaṃkleśaś ca śeṣaiḥ /	Among these, causal afflictions-together consist of those limbs of dependent origination which have the nature of affliction and action ;
saptadhā saṃkleśaḥ saptavidho hetuḥ / viparyāsahetuḥ / ākṣepahetuḥ i upanayahetuḥ / parigrahahetuḥ / upabhogahetuḥ /	Afflictions-together are sevenfold: These are essentially causal afflictions-together in their seven modes: the cause of reversal, the cause of being thrown forth, the cause of conducting near, the cause of holding fast, the cause of experiencing, the cause of being pulled along, and the cause of agitation.
tatra viparyāsahetur avidyā / ākṣepahetuḥ saṃskārāḥ / upanayahetur vijñānaṃ / parigrahahetur nāmarūpaṣaḍāyatane / upabhogahetuḥ sparśavedane /	Among these, ignorance is the cause of reversal, motivating dispositions are the cause of being thrown forth, consciousness is the cause of conducting near, the cause of holding fast is the psycho-physical complex and the six sense-fields, the cause of experiencing is contact and feeling, the cause of being pulled along is craving, clinging, and being, and the cause of agitation is birth, decrepitude, and dying.
sarvaś caiṣa saṃkleśo 'bhūtaparikalpāt pravartata iti /	In every way, afflictions-together develop because of the construction of that which was not : this is the compact meaning.
piṇḍārthaḥ punar abhūtaparikalpasya navavidhaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ paridīpitaṃ bhavati / sallakṣaṇaṃ / asallakṣaṇaṃ svalakṣaṇaṃ / saṃgrahalakṣaṇaṃ asallakṣaṇānupraveśopāyalakṣaṇaṃ / prabhedalakṣaṇaṃ /	So the nine-fold characteristics of the construction of that which was not have been illuminated : its character as existent, its character as non-existent, its owncharacter, its comprising character, its character allowing it to penetrate to its own non-existent character, its character of being divided, the character of its synonyms, its character of evolving, and its character of afflictions-together.
evam abhūtaparikalpaṃ khyāpayitvā yathā śūnyatā vijñeyā tan nirdiśati / lakṣaṇaṃ cātha paryāyas tadartho bheda eva ca / sādhanaṃ ceti vijñeyaṃ śūnyatāyāḥ samāsataḥ //	Having in this way explained the construction of that which was not, in order that emptiness can also be known, he says : "Emptiness' characteristics, synonyms, meanings, divisions, and its demonstration, should be concisely known." I.
kathaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ vijñeyaṃ / dvayābhāvo hy abhāvasya bhāvaḥ śūnyasya lakṣaṇaṃ /	How should its characteristics be known ? "The non-being of duality, and the being of this non-being, is the characteristic of emptiness." I.
dvayagrāhyagrāhakasyābhāvaḥ /	a It is the non-being of duality, i.e. of the object apprehended and subject apprehendor.

lakṣaṇam ity abhāvasvabhāvalakṣaṇatvaṃ śūnyatāyāḥ paridīpitaṃ bhavati /	In this way, emptiness' characteristicness of both non-being and own-being is illuminated.
yaś cāsau tadabhāvasvabhāvaḥ sa / na bhāvo nāpi cābhāvaḥ /	As it is both non-being and own-being, it is "neither a being nor a non-being".
kathaṃ na bhāvo yasmāt dvayasyābhāvaḥ / kathaṃ nābhāvo yasmāt dvayābhāvasya bhāvaḥ /	How is it not being? Because of the non-being of duality. How is it not non-being? Because of the being of the nonbeing of duality.
etac ca śūnyatāyā lakṣaṇaṃ / tasmād abhūtaparikalpān	And this is the characteristic of emptiness. Thus it is "a characteristic neither the same nor different" I.

pṛthaktve sati dharmād anyā dharmateti na yujyate /	If it were different, the real nature of an event would be different from the event itself .
anityatāduḥkhatāvat /	To speak of emptiness and the construction of that which was not as being different would be as absurd as speaking of "impermanence" and "suffering" as being something different from impermanent and suffering beings themselves.

kathaṃ paryāyārtho vijñeyaḥ / ananyathāviparyāsatannirodhāryagocaraiḥ / hetutvāc cāryadharmāṇāṃ paryāyārtho yathākramaṃ //	How are the meanings of these synonyms to be known ? "From being non-otherness, non-reversal, cessation the scope of the exalted, and the cause of exalted events, the meanings of the synonyms are understood in order." I.
ananyathārthena tathātā nityan tathaiveti kṛtvā aviparyāsārthena bhūtakoṭiḥ viparyāsāvastutvāt /	It is Suchness in the sense of non-otherness in the sense that it is just so, all the time. It is the reality-limit in the sense of there being no reversals there, because of the insubstantiality of reversals.
nimittanirodhārthenānimittaṃ sarvanimittābhāvāt /	It is the signless in the sense of being the cessation of all signs, there being a total non-being of signs there.
āryajñānagocaratvāt paramārthaḥ / paramajñānaviṣayatvād āryadharmahetutvād dharmadhātuḥ /	Because it is the scope of exalted knowledge, it is called “the ultimate”, and because it is the causal ground for exalted events, it is called "the Ground of all Events".

As regards mental attention which is the cause of the semblance of object apprehended and subject apprehendor, this mental attention towards talk is itself to be known as a basis for the distinction of object apprehended and subject apprehendor, because it is suffused with cognitions of verbal specification.

dharmadhātor viśuddhatvāt prakṛtyā vyomavat punaḥ /	"Because of the Ground of all Events' clarity by nature, it is like the sky;

V. Because of the Ground of all Events being like space, it is clear by nature, and the duality "clear" and "unclear" is only adventitious, arising later.
yad evaṃjñānam ayam āgantukatve 'viparyāsaḥ /	The knowledge of this in this way is a lack of reversal as regards the purely adventitious.

V. Because there is neither a "person" nor "events", there can be neither afflictions-together or thorough clearing for them.

And if they do exist, luminousness of nature is not logical." This objection is refuted by the likeness of magical creations, for that which is magically created is not to be found, and yet is apprehended.
yathā māyākṛtaṃ na vidyata upalabhyate ca yadi prakṛtiprabhāsvaratā dharmāṇāṃ tat kathaṃ pūrvaṃ saṃkleśaḥ paścād vyavadānaṃ /	: "If there is luminousness of nature, how can there be affliction in events, and only subsequently alleviation ?" The refutation of this objection can be known as coming through the likeness of affliction and alleviation to space.

The refutation to this comes through the lack of detriment and lack of excellence .

V. To say that there is a difference between materiality, etc.

ātmeti pudgalasamāropāntaḥ nairātmyam ity apavādāntaḥ prajñaptisato 'py apavādāt /	"There is a self" is the extreme of superimposing a fixed personality, and the extreme of denial is to say that "All is without a self".
tatparivarjanārthaṃ madhyamā pratipad yad ātmanairātmyayor madhyaṃ nirvikalpaṃ jñānaṃ / bhūtaṃ cittam iti dharmasamāropāntaḥ abhūtam ity apavādāntaḥ /	In order to avoid these extremes, there is the middle path which is a knowledge free from discriminations standing midway between maintaining self and maintaining non-self. "A citta was" is an Käsyapa-parivarta-sūtra -. extreme of superimposition as regards events, and “It wasn't" is an extreme of denial.
tatparivarjanārthaṃ madhyamā pratipad yatra na cittaṃ na cetanā na mano na vijñānaṃ /	In order to avoid these extremes, there is the middle path, where there is neither "citta" nor “volition" nor "manas" nor "consciousness".

In order to avoid these extremes, there is the middle path, which does not admit these two extremes, does not speak of them, and has nothing to do with them.

In order to avoid these two extremes, there is the middle path, which stands in the middle as regards these two extremes.
avidyā grāhyā grāhakā cety antaḥ /	To suppose that objects apprehended and subjects apprehendors always imply ignorance, is another extreme.

trividhaḥ saṃkleśaḥ / kleśasaṃkleśaḥ / karmasaṃkleśaḥ / janmasaṃkleśaś ca /	Afflictions-together are of three kinds: the afflictions-together of the afflictions, the afflictions-together of actions, and the afflictions-together of birth.

karmasaṃkleśaḥ / śubhāśubhakarmābhisaṃskāraḥ yasya pratipakṣo jñānānabhisaṃskāraḥ /	The afflictions-together of action are unafflicted and afflicted motivating dispositions, of which the antidote is the lack of motivating dispositions in knowledge.

etasya trividhasya saṃkleśasyāpagamo vyavadānaṃ /	The disappearance of these three kinds of affliction constitutes alleviation.
tatra jñānaśūnyatādibhiḥ /	In this connection, because of the emptiness of knowledge, etc.

So if there is the discrimination that something is being afflictedtogether or thoroughly cleared, this is an extreme, because of the non-being of afflictions-together and thorough clearing in that which is unafflicted by nature.
madhyamā pratipat / yan na śūnyatayā dharmāñ chūnyāṃ karoti / api tu dharmā eva śūnyā ity evamādi /	In order to avoid this extreme, there is a middle path, which does not make events empty because of an "emptiness", but yet sees all events as empty.

A discrimination as to "something which is to be brought to rest" is an extreme.
śāmye 'pi vikalpo 'ntaḥ /	A discrimination as to a state of putting to rest is another extreme.
śamane 'pi vikalpo 'nataḥ praheyaprahāṇakalpanayā śūnyatāyās trasanād etasya vikalpadvayāntasya parivarjanārtham ākāśadṛṣṭāntaḥ / trāsye 'pi vikalpo 'ntas tataś ca trāsyād bhaye 'pi parikalpitarūpāditrasanāt duḥkhabhīrutayā etasya vikalpadvayāntasya parivarjanārthaṃ citrakaradṛṣṭāntaḥ /	Because of a fear of emptiness that comes with discriminating "something to be abandoned" and "its abandonment". For avoiding these extremes discriminating a duality, there is the example of space. A discrimination as to "something that is to be feared” is an extreme, and a discrimination of fear that comes from assuming "something that is to be feared” is an extreme, because of the frightening aspect of suffering which comes from fear towards the aggregates of materilaity, etc.
pūrvako dṛṣṭāntaḥ śrāvakān ārabhyāyaṃ tu bodhisatvān /	In order to avoid this extreme of discriminating a duality, there is the example of the painter. The former example of space is employed by Śrāvakas also, but this example only by Bodhisattvas.

For avoiding these extremes discriminating a duality, there is the example of the magician. Though there is no being of an object because of the knowledge of perception-only, through this knowledge that there is no object, "perception-only" is also refuted.
arthābhāve vijñaptyasaṃbhavād ity etad atra sādharmyaṃ /	When there is no being , perception is not possible, so these are alike in this way.
samyaktve 'pi vikalpo 'ntaḥ mithyātve 'pi bhūtapratyavekṣāṃ samyaktvena kalpayato mithyātvena vā etasyāntadvayasya parivarjanārthaṃ /	A discrimination as to "rightness" is also an extreme. A discrimination as to "wrongness" is also an extreme, because one discriminates from an investigation of what already was, as regards either "rightness" or "wrongness".
kāṣṭhadvayāgnidṛṣṭāntaḥ /	For avoiding these extremes involving a duality, there is the example of two sticks of wood.
yathākāṣṭhadvayād anagnilakṣaṇād agnir jāyate / jātaś ca tad eva kāṣṭhadvayaṃ dahaty evam asamyaktvalakṣaṇāyā yathābhūtapratyavekṣāyāḥ samyaktvalakṣaṇam āryaṃ prajñendriyaṃ jāyate jātaṃ ca tām eva bhūtapratyavekṣāṃ vibhāvayatīty	Just as, from the friction of two sticks of wood, where there is no characteristic of fire present, a'fire suddenly arises, and once arisen, burns up the sticks of wood, just so, it is in an examination of how events were which has a characteristic which does not partake of rightness, that the aim which has a characteristic of rightness, i.e. the faculty of insight, arises. And when it has arisen, it causes the same investigation of what was to disappear.
etad atra sādharmyaṃ na cāsamyaktvalakṣaṇāpi bhūtapratyavekṣā mithyātvalakṣaṇā samyaktvānukūlyāt / vyāpṛtāv api vikalpo 'ntaḥ / avyāpṛtāv api jñānasya buddhipūrvāṃ kriyāṃ niḥsāmarthyaṃ vā kalpayataḥ /	So these are alike in this way. For there is no favoring of rightness except through a characteristic of non-rightness, i.e. an investigation of what already was, which has the characteristic of wrongness.⁹ A discrimination as to "practise" is also an extreme and discrimination as to "non-practise" is also an extreme, by which one discriminates either an activity which precedes enlightenment, or a lack of capacity.
etasya vikalpadvayāntasya parivarjanārthaṃ / tailapradyotadṛṣṭāntaḥ /	For avoiding these extremes discriminating a duality, there is the example of the oillamp. A discrimination as to a "state of non-arising" is an extreme.
ajanmatve 'pi vikalpo 'ntaḥ samakālatve 'pi yadi pratipakṣasyānutpattiṃ vā kalpayati	A discrimination as to simultaneity is also an extreme. Such as when one discriminates the non-arising of antidotes, or the loug duration of the afflictions-together.
saṃkleśasyaiva vā dīrghakālatvam etasya vikalpadvayāntasya parivarjanārthaṃ dvitīyas tailapradyotadṛṣṭāntaḥ / uktāntadvayaparivarjane pratipattiḥ /	For avoiding these extremes discriminating a duality, there is the second example of the oil-lamp.¹ And so the practise of abandoning extremes discriminating a duality, has been explained.

"This Treatise is the Separating Out, the Explanation of the Middle" because of its explanation of the Middle Path by an explanation of the middle and two extremes, or by an explanation of the middle's avoiding these extremes, "And it has as its import the deep essence" because it is beyond the scope of dialectics, and because it is impenetrable by antagonists "and is of great use" both to "oneself" and "others".
