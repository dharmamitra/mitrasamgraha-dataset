It is through their collectivity, i.e. various kinds of materialities, etc., being heaped up together that "times", "series", "aspects", "developments", and "sense-objects" seem to occur.² 27 The twelve sense-fields are the sense-field of the eye and the sense-field of visibles, the sense-field of the ear and the sensefield of sounds, the sense-field of the nose and the sense-field of smells, the sense-field of the tongue and the sense-field of tastes, the sense-field of the body and the sense-field of tactile sensations, the sense-field of manas and the sense-field of mentally cognizables.

Because they grasp an "own-74 Seven Works of Vasubandhu characteristic", though without a "doer".32 As to why they are called "aggregates", etc., this serves as an antidote to the three kinds of grasping after self, in order.
