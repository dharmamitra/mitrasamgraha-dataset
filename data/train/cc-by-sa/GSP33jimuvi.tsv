vakṣye vividiṣānyāsaṃ vidvannyāsaṃ ca bhedataḥ / hetū videhamukteśca jīvanmukteśca tau kramāt // sannyāsaheturvairāgyaṃ yadaharvirajet tadā /	I am going to expound the renunciation of the seeker and the renunciation of the knower, distinguishing the one from the other, which are the cause of 'liberation after death', i.e. deliverance through release from the body, and 'liberation in life', i.e. emancipation while still alive, respectively.2 The cause of renunciation is the feeling of disgust towards worldly things, as is prescribed in the Veda “The day one has aversion for the world, he should renounce' .
pravrajediti vedoktestadbhedastu purāṇagaḥ //	The variety of this renunciation is found in the Purāņas.
viraktidvividhā proktā tīvrā tīvratareti ca /	Indifference to worldly objects is said to be of two kinds : strong and stronger.
satyāmeva tu tīvrāyāṃ nyasyed yogī kuṭīcake //	In the case of strong dislike the renouncer stays in the stage of a kuticaka, i.e. of a yogi who stays in a hut etc., away from the locality permanently;
tu śakto bahūdake tīvratarāyāṃ haṃsasaṃjñite / mumukṣuḥ parame haṃse sākṣād vijñānasādhane //	With stronger aversion, desiring liberation, he attains to the state of a harnsa which, when mature, leads him to the state of a paramaharnsa, the direct means to the ultimate knowledge.
putradāradhanādīnāṃ nāśe tātkālikī matiḥ / dhik saṃsāramitīdṛk syād viraktermandatā hi sā //	Such thought as the worldly life is not worth it', occurs temporarily in the loss of a son or wife or wealth, which is considered to be weak detachment.
iti yā susthirā buddhiḥ sā vairāgyasya tīvratā //	The determination not to have a child, wife, etc., in this life is said to be strong detachment.
, punarāvṛttisahito loko me māstu kaścana / iti tīvrataratvaṃ syānmande nyāso na ko'pi hi //	PANTAN} Such thought as: 'For me the world with its cycle of rebirth etc., shall not be,' is considered the stronger detachment.
yātrādyaśaktiśaktibhyāṃ tīvre nyāsadvayaṃ bhavet / kuṭīcako bahūdaścetyubhāvetau tridaṇḍinau //	In strong detachment two kinds of renunciation namely, the kuticaka and the bahūdaka varieties are possible with, respectively, the absence or presence of the ability to move from place to place etc. Both of them are tridandins .
dvayaṃ tīvratare brahmalokamokṣavibhedataḥ / talloke tattvaviddhaṃso loke'smin parahaṃsakaḥ //	The other two varieties of sannyāsa namely, harmsa and paramahamsa, are possible in stronger aversion to worldly life and its goods. The difference between them is that the former leads to brahmaloka and the latter to moksa, i.e. to complete liberation.
eteṣāṃ tu samācārāḥ proktāḥ pārāśarasmṛtau / vyākhyāne'smābhiratrāyaṃ parahaṃso vivicyate //	While commenting on the Pārāśara smrti, the forms and practices of all these varieties of sannyāsins have been dealt with ; here we take up only the paramahamsa variety for discussion.
jijñāsurjñānavāṃśceti parahaṃso dvidhā mataḥ / prāhurjñānāya jijñāsornyāsaṃ vājasaneyinaḥ //	There are two kinds of paramahamsas: seeker and knower. According to the Vājasaneya school of the Vedas a seeker's renunciation is for the attainment of knowledge.
'pravrājino lokametamicchantaḥ pravrajanti hi' /	'Sannyāsins desiring this loka renounce their worldly life' *.
etasyārthastu gadyena vakṣyate mandabuddhaye //	The meaning of this text is being elaborated in prose to help those who are slow to understand.
loko hi dvividhaḥ, ātmaloko'nātmalokaśceti /	There are two kinds of worlds: one is ātmalokathe world of the Self and the other is anātmaloka the world of the non-Self.
tatrānātmalokasya traividhyaṃ bṛhadāraṇyake tṛtīyādhyāye śrūyate –'atha trayo vāva lokā manuṣyalokaḥ pitṛloko devaloka iti /	In the third chapter of the Brhadāranyaka Upanisad three kinds of the anātmaloka have been described : 'Indeed, there are then three worlds —lokas: the world of men, the world of the manes, and the world of the gods.
so'yaṃ manuṣyalokaḥ putreṇaiva jayyo nānyena karmaṇā, karmaṇā pitṛloko vidyayā devaloka:' iti /	The world of men is attainable only by a son and by no other religious rites; the world of the manes by religious acts ; and the world of gods by knowledge' .

And also thus: 'One should be in the pursuit of this ātmaloka; he who devotes himself to this ātmaloka, his efforts do not fail him' .

What should we worship gods for ?' . 'What should we do with children since to us this world of the Self is supreme ?’ .

In the text beginning with : 'He • An adapted text quoted by ācārya Sankara Bhagavatpāda in his bhāsya on the Chāndogya Upanisad 1) among others; the whole text is quoted by Maharsi6 indeed is this great, unborn atmā' , the ātman is referred to by the word 'this'.
lokyate'nubhūyata iti lokaḥ /	That which is seen, experienced, realized, is loka.
tathā cātmānubhavamicchantaḥ pravrajantīti śrutestātparyārthaḥ saṃpadyate /	So, the implied meaning of the text is: 'Desirous of Self-realization renounce'.

iha janmani janmāntare vā samyaganuṣṭhitairvedānuvacanādibhirutpannayā vividiṣayā saṃpāditatvādayaṃ vividiṣāsannyāsa ityabhidhīyate /	In this life or in the previous ones, by the study of the Vedas and other religious acts, as enjoined by the Vedas, the desire for Self-realization arises; the renunciation brought about by this desire is called the 'renunciation of the seeker'.
ayaṃ ca vedanahetuḥ sannyāso dvividhaḥ, janmāpādakakāmyakarmādityāgamātrātmakaḥ, preṣoccāraṇapūrvaka daṇḍadhāraṇādyāśramarūpaśceti /	This renunciation, which is the means to knowledge, is of two kinds: renunciation of such acts only which, done with selfish motives, lead to rebirth etc., and the other is taking to orders by muttering the praisa formula and accepting the danda etc. In consequence of praiṣoccāraṇam-muttering of praisa, the renouncer becomes a knower of the Self, amiable and absorbed in the contemplation of Brahman;
"puṃjanma labhate mātā patnī ca praiṣamātrataḥ /	and his mother and wife are reborn as males' .
tyāgaśca taittirīyādau śrūyate– ‘na karmaṇā na prajayā dhanena tyāgenaike amṛtatvamānaśuḥ' te ā iti /	The Taittiriya school of the Vedas and other Upanişads speak of renunciation: 'Some have achieved immortality not by work, nor by progeny, nor by wealth, but by renunciation alone' .

The caturdharī tīkā* on the Mokṣadharmaparvan concludes while dealing with the discourse between Sulabhā and Janaka that, as their male counterpart, ladies are entitled to subsist on alms, to study the scriptures dealing with emancipation i.e.Up. anișads etc., to meditate on the Self in seclusion, and to carry the tridanda-three thin sticks tied together, symbols of sannyāsa. The part of the text beginning with ‘bhikṣukî-iti-anena' and ending with 'sulabhā-janaka-samvade'seems to be an interpolation as the caturdhari-ṭīká of Nilakaṇṭha Sūrī was not written until the last quarter of the seventeenth century AD, vide Mahābhārata , Ädiparvan, Prolegomena, p.
ata eva maitreyīvākyamāmnāyate—'yenāhaṃ nāmṛtā syāṃ kimahaṃ tena kuryāṃ yadeva bhagavān veda tadeva me brūhi' iti /	So the words of Maitreyi are mentioned, 'With that what should I do, which won't lead me to the final emancipation ? Tell me that what your holiness knows' .

There is no dearth of references to such enlightened ones in the Vedas, Smṛtis, Purāṇas, and Itihāsas, as also in the present day society.

I am going to give up this life of a householder and taking to pravrajya. For, this, indeed, leads to immortality ", saying this Yājñavalkya left' .

This Upanisadic text should not be considered to refer to the renunciation of the seeker, because, that will not agree with the 'ktvā' suffix in viditvā indicating the past time, and the word brāhmana, meaning one who has known Brahman, the Supreme Self.

In the Śārira-Brāhmana also, the renunciation of the seeker and the renunciation of the knower are clearly pointed out — 'Knowing It alone one becomes a sagemuni; desiring this world alone, monks renounce their homes' .
munitvaṃ mananaśīlatvam ; taccāsati kartavyāntare sambhavatītyarthāt saṃnyāsa evābhidhīyate /	wishe The sagehood is the state of reflection. And that is possible when there is no other duty to be performed. So, by this, sannyāsa alone is indicated.

Afterwards when Atri objects that a brāhmana without a sacred thread is no brāhmana, he solves the problem by saying that the self-knowledge is the real sacred-thread .

Then vidvat-sannyasa, the knower's renunciation, which is the end of the former , is described thus: 'The paramahamsa is precisely he who is like a new-born baby, whose mind is free from the effects of the pairs of opposites, devoid of all possessions, who is firmly established in the way of Brahman i.e. the final emancipation, whose mind is free from all desires, who, just to maintain life without any obligation, goes about begging at the prescribed time, using his belly as the begging bowl, and is unperturbed whether he gets it or not, without a fixed dwelling, lives in anywhere from a derelict house, a temple, a hay-stack, under a tree, in a pottery, in a house where sacrificial fire is kept, on the riverside, in a mountain-cave or chasm, in a hollow tree, through a sacrificial place built near a spring, devoid of any effort, without the feeling of “Iand mine”, ever meditating on the pure Spirit, grounded in the supreme Self, extirpating all good as well as evil actions, gives up his body with complete detachment' .

And then he goes on to prescribe, 'You should take bath at the three sandhyās, during meditation concentrate on the Self, study the Aranyaka part of the Vedas, and the Upanisads'.

This is the chiefneither the staff, nor the topknct, nor the sacred-thread, nor the cloak, without all these moves the paramaharmsa. Thus the absence of the staff etc., the symbols of this sannyāsa, is the textual commandment; saying this: neither cold nor heat '; and with these words: ‘wearing the sky's regions as his garment and for him no convention of salutation etc.', it is thus shown that the paramaharisa is absolutely free from all social norms and conventions.

tattvajñānamanonāśavāsa nākṣayāstatsādhanam /	The knowledge of the Truth, the annihilation of the mind and the effacement of the impressions of the latent desires are the means of jivanmukti;

anvayamuktvā vyatirekamāha ‘traya ete samaṃ yāvanna svabhyastā muhurmuhuḥ / tāvanna padasaṃprāptirbhavatyapi samāśataiḥ //iti //	now in the absence of the means the result will also be absent is being shown thus :76 ‘Until these three means are not repeatedly well practised together, the realization of that state does not take place even by hundreds of years .
samakālābhyāsābhāve bādhakamāha 'ekaikaśo niṣevyante yadyete cirayatnataḥ / tanna siddhiṃ prayacchanti mantrā: saṃkalitā iva //'	He describes how it impedes the result if not practised together thus : ‘If they are practised one at a time, even for a long time with arduous efforts, they do not yield result, even as the mantras—scriptural formulas— fail to produce result if muttered piecemeal and at an interval' .
yathā saṃdhyāvandanamārjane sahaviniyuktānām 'āpo hi ṣṭhā' ṛ saṃ ityādīnāṃ tisṛṇāmṛcāṃ madhye pratidinamekaikasyā ṛcaḥ pāṭhe śāstrīyānuṣṭhānaṃ na sidhyati, yathā vā ṣaḍaṅgamantrāṇāmekaikamantreṇa na siddhiḥ, yathā vā loke śākasūpaudanādīnāmekaikena na bhojanasiddhiḥ, tadvat /	if instead of reciting all the three mantras a rk a day is recited, the scriptural observance does not succeed; or a mantra with six limbs will not produce result if used one part at a time with interval; or in the mundane matters such as dinner, if only one course, i.e. either vegetable or soup or rice is served instead of all of them together, the purpose is not served.
cirābhyāsasya prayojanamāha ‘tribhiretaiścirābhyastairhṛdayagranthayo dṛḍhāḥ/ niḥśaṅkameva truṭyanti bisacchedādguṇā iva //'	The necessity of prolonged practice is described thus: ‘By prolonged practice of these three means the firm fetters of the heart are undoubtedly broken just as the threads of lotus in its stalk when cut' .

trayāṇāmeteṣāṃ madhye dvayordvayormelanena trīṇi dvandvāni bhavanti /	Coupled mutually three pairs are derived from these means;
manonāśavāsanākṣayadvandvasyānyonyakāraṇatvaṃ vyatirekamukhenāha tatra 'yāvadvilīnaṃ na mano na tāvadvāsanākṣayaḥ /	among them the pair consisting of the dissolution of the mind and the effacement of impressions has mutual causal relation which is being described here, negatively thus : 'Until the mind is dissolved there cannot be effacement of the latent impressions;
na kṣīṇā vāsanā yāvattāvaccittaṃ na śāmyati //'	and till the latent impressions are not effaced, the mind does not dissolve' .
, pradīpajvālāsaṃtānavadvṛttisaṃtānarūpeṇa pariṇamamānamantaḥkaraṇadravyaṃ mananātma katvānmana ityucyate /	The internal sense-organs taking the form of a series of modifications, like the series of the flames of a lamp, is called the mind for its mental functions.
tasya nāśo nāma vṛttirūpapariṇāmaṃ parityajya niruddhatvākāreṇa pariṇāmaḥ /	The dissolution of it means its giving up the changes in the form of transformations and remaining in the form of controlling transformations stopped from taking further modification.
tathā ca patañjaliryogaśāstre sūtrayāmāsa— ‘vyutthānanirodhasaṃskārayorabhibhavaprādurbhāvau nirodhapariṇāma:' iti /	Patañjali has formulated it thus in the Yoga Sūtras: 'When the mental modification subsides and the restraining impression arises , this moment of cessation when links up with the mind is called transformation into cessation' .
nirodhakṣaṇacittānvayo vyutthānasaṃskārā abhibhūyante ; nirodhasaṃskārāḥ prādurbhavanti; nirodhayuktaḥ kṣaṇaścittenānvīyate; so'yaṃ manonāśa ityavagantavyam /	When the impressions of transformation are neutralized, the impressions of control appear and the moment of control is connected with the mind-this state is to be known as the dissolution of the mind.
pūrvāparaparāmarśamantareṇa sahasotpadyamānasya krodhādivṛttiviśeṣasya hetuścittagataḥ saṃskāro vāsanā, pūrvapūrvābhyāsena citte vāsyamānatvāt /	The mental transformation denoting anger or the like suddenly taking place without giving thought to the past or the future, is due to the latent impressions in the mind, which is also known as vāsanā — desire left behind by the previous experiences in the mind .
tasyāśca vāsanāyā: kṣayo nāma vivekajanyāyāṃ śāntidāntyādiśuddhavāsanāyāṃ dṛḍhāyāṃ satyapi bāhyanimitte krodhādyanutpattiḥ /	this happens when the pure impressions such as self-restraint and the like which are brought about by discrimination, are engraved.
tatra manonāśābhāve vṛttiṣūtpadyamānāsu kadācid bāhyanimittena krodhādyutpatternāsti vāsanākṣayaḥ/	Then if the mind remains undissolved, the transformations would continue to take place and sometime or other anger and the like would arise caused by external stimulus, so, no effacement of vāsanà.
akṣīṇāyāṃ tu vāsanāyāṃ tathaiva vṛtyutpādanānnāsti manonāśaḥ /	Likewise, if the vāsanā is not effaced transformation would take place, so no dissolution of the mind.
tattvajñānamanonāśayoḥ parasparakāraṇatvaṃ vyatirekamukheṇāha 'yāvanna tattvavijñānaṃ tāvaccittaśamaḥ kutaḥ / yāvanna cittopaśamo na tāvat tattvavedanam //'	Knowledge of the Reality and the dissolution of the mind have mutual causal relation which is now being described in a negative way thus : ‘Until there is knowledge of Reality how can the mind be calm ? The knowledge of Reality cannot arise till the mind is not calm' .
‘idaṃ sarvamātmaiva, pratīyamānaṃ tu rūparasādikaṃ jaganmāyāmayam na tvetadvastuto'sti' iti niścayastattvajñānam/	‘All this is verily the Atman, the apparent world beginning with the form, taste and the like is illusory; it is not really existent' — such conviction is the knowledge of Truth.
tasyānutpattau rūparasādiviṣayāṇāṃ sadbhāve sati tadgocarāścittavṛttayo na nivārayituṃ śakyante yathā prakṣipyamāṇeṣvindhanādiṣu vahnijvālā na nivāryate tadvat /	In the absence of such knowledge and with the presence of the sense-objects such as form, taste and the like, mental transformations in their shapes cannot be stopped, just as by adding fuel to fire the flames cannot be stopped.
asati cittopaśame vṛttibhirgṛhyamāṇeṣu rūpādiṣu 'neha nānāsti kiṃcana' kaṭha upa iti śruteḥ 'yajamāna: prastara: ' tai ityāderiva pratyakṣavirodhaśaṅkayā 'brahmādvitīyam' ityetādṛśastattvaniścayo nodiyāt /	In the absence of mental calm, forms, taste, etc. will be experienced through the transformations of the mind and, consequently doubt will arise about the verity of such śruti text as: ‘There is no duality in this whatever' , just as in the case of the text : 'The sacred grass is the sacrificer' , as they both go against the objective experience. So, the conviction of 'Brahman is One without a second' will never arise.
brā vāsanākṣayatattvajñānayoḥ parasparakāraṇatvaṃ vyatirekamukhenāha 'yāvanna vāsanānāśastāvattattvāgamaḥ kutaḥ / yāvanna tattvasaṃprāptirna tāvadvāsanākṣayaḥ //' iti / krodhādivāsanāsvanaṣṭāsu śamadamādisādhanābhāvānna tattvajñānamudeti /	The mutual causal relation between the effacement of the impressions and knowledge of the Truth is being described contrariwise thus : ‘Until the impressions are wiped out how can there arise knowledge ? And till the attainment of knowledge there cannot be wiping out of the impressions If the latent impressions of anger and the like remain uneffaced, there cannot arise the knowledge of the Truth, because of the absence of the means such as self-restraint and the like.
ajñāte cādvitīyabrahmatattve krodhādinimittasya satyatvabhramānapāyānna vāsanā kṣīyate /	Without the realization of Brahman as 'Ultimate Reality without a second' the illusory reality of the causes of anger and the like is not sublated — hence no effacement of vāsanā is possible.
yathoktānāṃ trayāṇāṃ dvandvānāmanyonyakāraṇatvamanvayamukhena vayamudāharāmaḥ /	We are now going to describe with examples the mutual causal relation of the aforesaid three pairs in a positive way.
manasi naṣṭe sati saṃskārodbodhakasya bāhyanimittasyāpratītau vāsanā kṣīyate, kṣīṇāyāṃ ca vāsanāyāṃ hetvabhāvena krodhādivṛtyanudayānmano naśyati /	The mind having been dissolved the external causeswhich arouse the impressions — are not perceived hence vāsanās are wiped out. And when the vāsanās —the latent impressions—are destroyed, mental transformations such as anger etc. do not occur due to the absence of their cause, hence the dissolution of the mind.
tadidaṃ manonāśavāsanākṣayadvandvam /	So, this is the pair of the dissolution of the mind and the effacement of the latent impressions.
'dṛśyate tvagyrayā buddhyā' kaṭhopa iti mavagamyate/ sati ca tattvajñāne, mithyābhūte jagati naraviṣāṇādāviva dhīvṛttyanudayādātmanaśca dṛṣṭatvena punarvṛttyanupayogānnirindhanāgnivanmano naśyati/	When the Supreme Reality becomes known, the world becomes unreal and no mental modification about this unreal world takes place just as a transformation in the shape of the 'horns of a man' never takes place ; further mental transformation is unnecessary since the Atman is already seen, so the mind dissolves, even as a fire is extinguished in the absence of fuel.
tadidaṃ manonāśatattvajñānayordvandvam /	This is about the pair consisting of the dissolution of the mind and the knowledge of Truth.
tattvajñānasya krodhādivāsanākṣayahetutāṃ vārttikakāra āha 'ripau bandhau svadehe ca samaikātmyaṃ prapaśyataḥ / vivekinaḥ kutaḥ kopa: svadehāvayaveṣviva //'	The knowledge of the ultimate Reality leads to the effacement of the latent impressions such as anger and the like, which is thus described by the Vārttikakāra Sureśvarācārya: ‘From where can there be anger for a man of discrimination who sees the same One Self in the bodies of his friends, foes and his own, just as one perceives the same one body in all one's limbs' .
naiṣkarmyasiddhau iti /	the means to knowledge.
vasiṣṭho'pi 'guṇā: śamādayo jñānācchamādibhyastathā jñatā / parasparaṃ vivardhete dve padmasarasī iva //'	Vasistha also says: ‘The virtues as self-restraint etc. prosper on knowledge and knowledge thrives on the virtues, even as the lake and the lotus thrive on each other .
tadidaṃ vāsanākṣayatattvajñānayordvandvam /	This is the pair of the knowledge of Truth and the effacement of vāsanà.
tattvajñānādīnāṃ trayāṇāṃ saṃpādane sādhanamāha 'tasmādrāghava yatnena pauruṣeṇa vivekinā / bhogecchāṃ dūratastyaktvā trayametatsamāśrayet //' iti / laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe iti / pauruṣo yatnaḥ kenāpyupāyenāvaśyaṃ saṃpādayiṣyāmītyevaṃvidhotsāharūpo nirbandhaḥ/	The ways to attain the three means — the knowledge of Truth etc. – are described thus : ‘Therefore, O Rāghava, a discriminating man should, with resolute endeavour, give up the desire to enjoy and resort to these three-i.e.the knowledge of Truth, the dissolution of the mind and the effacement of vāsanās of the scriptures and the others are the means to the knowledge of Truth;
viveko nāma vibhajyaniścayaḥ – tattvajñānasya śravaṇādikaṃ sādhanam, manonāśasya yogaḥ, vāsanākṣayasya pratikūlavāsanotpādanamiti /	yoga is the means to the dissolution of the mind; production of contrary impressions is the means to the effacement of the latent impressions.
bhogecchāyāḥ svalpāyā apyabhyupagame 'haviṣā kṛṣṇavameva bhūya evābhivardhate' manu iti nyāyenātiprasaṅgasyadurvāratvāddūrata ityuktam /	Desire for enjoyment, if allowed even in a very small measure, will know no bounds, in the manner as has been said by the sage Manu'Just like the fire that continues to grow larger so long as it is fed with ghee ' — .

If it is like that then, first attaining the knowledge and then taking the vidvatsannyasa, as it appears, one should try, while alive, to free oneself from the bonds of vasana and mental states by accomplishing their destruction; but now knowledge and other means are being prescribed to be practised together; so, there is contradiction between the former and the latter directives. Reply : No harm in this, their compatibility can be shown from the standpoint of principal and subordinate relationship with each other.
doṣaḥ, pradhānopasarjanabhāvena vividiṣāsaṃnyāsinastattvajñānaṃ pradhānam manonāśavāsanākṣayāvupasarjanībhūtau; vidvatsaṃnyāsinastu tadvaiparītyam; ataḥ sahābhyāsa ubhayatrāpyaviruddhaḥ /	For the seeker the knowledge of Truth is essential, and the dissolution of the mind and the effacement of the impressions are secondary; for the knower it is just the other way round. So, there is no contradiction in the simultaneous practice of the three means in both the instances.
na ca tattvajñānotpattimātreṇa kṛtārthasya kimuttarakālīnenābhyāsaprayāseneti śaṅkanīyam, jīvanmuktiprayojananirūpaṇena parihariṣyamāṇatvāt /	It cannot be doubted as to what purpose will be served by the subsequent endeavour to practise the means when one has accomplished everything through the attainment of the supreme Knowledge alone for, we will show the usefulness of this for the purpose of Jivanmukti and thereby settle the doubt.

Answer: In reply we say that the Truth should be remembered by whatever means, time after time.

Reply: It cannot be said so because the inevitable experiencing of pleasure and pain brought about by a weak prārabdha is counteracted by the dissolution of the mind.92 Such experiencing can be removed by counteraction— keeping this in mind it is said thus : 'Had it been possible to prevent inevitable experiencing , then, Nala, Rāma, and Yudhisthira would never have become stricken with affliction' .

The Kaivalya Upanisad has it thus : ‘Not by action, nor by children, nor by wealth' So, he, who, without going through the discipline of knowledge, but, having practised, as far as possible, the effacement of the latent impressions and the dissolution of the mind, worships the conditioned Brahman, i.e., Brahman with attributes, does not attain the absolute unity of the Self because the subtle body remains undestroyed.

na ca nāmabrahmatvādīnāmajñānaśabdena pañcapādikācāryairvivakṣitatvāt /	Moreover, the theory of Pañcapādikā that 'knowledge only destroys ignorance' is not contradicted inasmuch as the concomitants – such as the notion of non-self and the like-of ignorance, are implied by the word ignorance;

If it is suggested that knowledge neutralized for the time being by the operative deeds — prārabdha karma-produces videhamukti later on just like fire neutralized by a spell becomes effective when it is over.

Moreover, how can momentary knowledge, being non-existent itself afterwards, bring about liberation at a later time? If it is suggested that another knowledge in the form of the final realization will arise, we say it cannotJIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA be since there remains no means. With the cessation of the impeding prärabdha the entire world of appearance --with its preceptor, scriptures, body and senses and the like-ceases to exist, so what would be the means to that final knowledge? Nor can it be challenged that in this context then what should be the meaning of the Sruti text-'There is, in the end, complete cessation from the illusion of the world' .
tato bhavadabhimatā vartamānadeharāhityalakṣaṇā videhamuktiḥ paścādastu dehapātānantaram; asmadabhimatā tu jñānasamakālīnaiva /	So let the videhamukti in the form of being devoid of the existing body you approve of, come after the cessation of the existing body; but the one we admit is simultaneous, with knowledge.

Afterwards the thoughts of friendship and others continue to flow without any conscious personal effort-just as breathing or shutting and opening of the eyelids. Although guided by the thoughts of friendship etc. he leads his life in this world, he shuns the thought whether he has exercised them fully or partly; and with effort he sets at rest such activities of the mind as sleep, day-dreaming, drowsiness, etc., then practises the desire for absolute knowledge.

Reply: It cannot be said so, for, in that case, unsteadiness of the impressions of the absolute knowledge will occur, even as a house is unsteady even if built with pillars and walls but without first preparing a strong foundation or, as the medicine taken without expelling the stronger faults from the body by purgation i.e., without purging the morbid elements, does not cure the disease.

Objection: Since the means to seeing is the conscious concentration — samprajñāta samadhi, in the form of one-pointed transformation brought about by contemplation, meditation and concentration, the restrained mind that has gained superconscious concentration in the Tranquil Self and like sleep is devoid of transformation, cannot be the means to seeing. Reply: It is not so, since the self-accomplished seeing cannot be prevented.

As the jar cannot be emptied of the ākāśa though emptied of water etc., and ākāśa certainly remains inside even when the mouth is covered; similarly the mind is born also, filled with the consciousness of the Self.

Similarly, experience of happiness in concentration by the mind , which is devoid of transformation or just remaining as an impression , hence very subtle in form, is meant by the śruti and smrti.

The separating, out of the defects that were present in the mind which have ripened by the exercise of discrimination from those that are yet to ripen, is the stage of analysis. When enjoying objects is given up with the understanding that all such enjoyments of objects, whether seen or heard, are miserable, only the longing remains in the mind; such thirstless state is the uni-sense stage of non-attachment.270 Complete non-attachment is named the stage of subjugation. Therefore, the lower kind of non-attachment--aparam vairāgyam-being the promoter of eight-limbed yoga, forms the internal means to the conscious variety of concentration, but it is external to superconscious concentration.
tatrāntaraṅgaṃ paraṃ vairāgyaṃ sūtrayati 'tatparaṃ puruṣakhyāterguṇavaitṛṣṇyam' iti /	The higher non-attachment-param vairāgyam— which is internal to superconscious concentration is being formulated thus : “That is extreme non-attachment which gives up even the qualities, and comes from the knowledge of the Purusa .

Patañjali describes the varying degrees of rapidity in the attainment of concentration according to the varying degrees of non-attachment in the aphorism thus : ‘Success is speedy for the extremely energetic' .
tadbhedādyoginastrividhāḥ mṛdusaṃvegā madhyasaṃvegāstī vrasaṃvegāśceti /	According to the degrees of non-attachment the yogis are of three classes: of weak non-attachment, of moderate non-attachment and of intense non-attachment.

The purpose is five-fold: protection of knowledge; practice of religious austerity; absence of disagreement; disappearance of sorrow;

The question of sublation does not arise inasmuch as the knowledge of Reality has been obtained through proper evidence. The answer is this — in the absence of tranquillity of the mind doubt and error may creep in;

Even the bodily activities of the knower of Brahman, from whom the apparent world has disappeared, is maintained, without his effort, by the vital air inspired by the supreme Lord;

As the bull driven by the driver to draw chariot etc. along the way reaches the yonder village himself without the need to be directed repeatedly by the driver, so the vital air engaged in this body by the supreme Lord maintains the activities of the body irrespective of effort by the individual.

In this fourth stage, the real nature of Brahman, the material cause of the whole world, being determined as pure existence in essence, and the only reality without a second, the yogi becomes aware of the unreality of the superimposed names and forms on Brahman, which are expressed by the word 'world'.

To him this instruction his own wife, son, etc’., is given because, who has taken to vividisa-sannyāsa before and now wants to take to vidvat-sannyāsa after enlightenment, has no occasion to renounce 'son and wife' etc. Objection : But how is this vidvat-sannyāsa to be accomplished, just in the same way as by muttering of the praisa formula, as prescribed for the other one the vividisā sannyāsa, or just in the ordinary way, as one casts off old garment or flees a disturbed village ? The first alternative cannot be since the enlightened one is not entitled to injunction or prohibition because he is not a doer of any act.
