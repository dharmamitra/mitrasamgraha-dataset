atha atas vedotpattim adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || yathā uvāca bhagavān dhanvantariḥ || 	Well, we[1] shall now describe the origin of the Science of Medicine, as disclosed by the holy Dhanvantari to his disciple Sushruta.

Once upon a time, when the holy Dhanvantari, the greatest of the mighty celestials, incarnated in the form of Divodasa, the king of Kasi, was blissfully seated, in his hermitage, surrounded by a concourse of holy Rishis; Aupadhenava, Vaitarana, Aurabhra, Paushkalavata, Karavirya, Gopura-rakshita, Sushruta and others addressed him as follows:— 
bhagavan śārīra mānasa āgantu vyādhibhiḥ vividha vedanā abhighāta upadrutān sanāthān api anāthavat viceṣṭamānān vikrośataḥ ca mānavān abhisamīkṣya manasi naḥ pīḍā bhavati teṣām sukha eṣiṇām roga upaśama artham ātmanaḥ ca prāṇayātrā artham pragāhita hetoḥ āyurvedam śrotum icchāmaḥ iha upadiśyamānam atrā āyattam aihikam āmuṣmikam ca śreyaḥ tat bhagavantam upapannāḥ smaḥ śiṣya tvena iti || 	“O Sire, it grieves us much to find men, though otherwise well befriended by their kin and relations, falling a prey to diseases, mental, physical, traumatic, or natural, and piteously wailing in agony like utterly friendless creatures on earth; and we supplicate thee, O Lord, to illumine our minds with the truths of the Eternal Ayurveda (Medical Science) so that we may faithfully discharge the duties allotted to us in life, and alleviate the sufferings of humanity at large. Bliss in this life and hereafter, is in the gift of this eternal Ayurveda, and for this, O Lord, we have made bold to approach thee as thy humble disciples.” 
tān uvāca bhagavān svāgatam vaḥ sarve eva a mīmāṃsyāḥ adhyāpyāḥ ca bhavantaḥ vatsāḥ || 	All of you are worthy of the honour of true pupilship or tutelage.” 
iha khalu āyurvedaḥ nāma upāṅgam atharvavedasya an utpādya eva prajāḥ śloka śata sahasra madhyāya sahasram ca kṛtavān svayambhūḥ tatas alpa āyuṣṭvam alpamedhaḥ tvam ca ālokya narāṇām bhūyaḥ aṣṭadhā praṇītavān || 	(which forms the subject of our present discourse), originally formed one of the subsections of the Atharva Veda; and even before the creation of mankind, the self-begotten Brahma strung it together into a hundred thousand couplets (Shlokas), divided into a thousand chapters. 
tat yathā śalyam śālākyam kāyacikitsā bhūtavidyā kaumārabhṛtyam agada tantram rasāyana tantram vājīkaraṇa tantram iti || 	But then he thought of the small duration of human life on earth, and the failing character of human memory, and found it prudent to divide the whole of the Ayurveda into eight different branches such as, the Salya-Tantra, the Salakya-Tantra, the Kaya-Chikitsa, the Bhuta-Vidya, the Kaumar-Bhritya, the Agada-Tantra, the Rasayana-Tantrani and the Vajīkarana-Tantra. 
ātha asya pratyaṅga lakṣaṇa samāsaḥ 	Now about the characteristic features of each of these branches of the Science of the Ayurveda 
tatra śalyam nāma vividha tṛṇa kāṣṭha pāṣāṇa pāṃśu loha loṣṭa asthi bāla nakha pūya āsrāva duṣṭavraṇa antargarbha śalya uddharaṇa artham yantra śastra kṣāra agni praṇidhāna vraṇa viniścaya artham ca || 	The scope of this branch of Medical Science is to remote from an ulcer; any extraneous substance such as, fragments of hay, particles of stone, dust, iron or bone; splinters, nails, hair, clotted blood, or condensed pus (as the case may be, or to draw out of the uterus a dead fetus, or to bring about safe parturitions in cases of false presentation, and to deal with the principle and mode of using and handling surgical instruments in general, and with the application of fire (cautery) and alkaline (caustic) substances, together with the diagnosis and treatment of ulcers. 
śālākyam nāma ūrdhva jatru gatānām śravaṇa nayana vadana ghrāṇa ādi saṃśritānām vyādhīnām upaśamana artham || 	Embraces as its object the treatment of those diseases which are restricted to the upward (lit:—region above the clavicles) fissures or cavities of the body, such as the ears, the eyes, the cavity of the mouth, the nostrils, etc. 
kāyacikītsā nāma sarva aṅga saṃśritānām vyādhīnām jvara raktapitta śoṣa unmāda apasmāra kuṣṭha meha atisāra ādīnām upaśamana artham || 	Treats of diseases, which, instead of being simply restricted to any, specific organ, or to any particular part of the body, affect the entire system, as Fever, Dysentery, Haemoptysis, Insanity, Hysteria, Leprosy, unnatural discharges from the urethra, etc. 
bhūtavidyā nāma deva asura gandharva yakṣa rakṣaḥ pitṛ piśāca nāga graha ādi upasṛṣṭa cetasām śānti karma balaḥ haraṇa ādi graha upaśamana artham || 	Lays down incantations and modes of exorcising evil spirits and making offerings to the gods, demons, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshas, etc. 
kaumārabhṛtyam nāma kumāra bharaṇa dhātrī kṣīra doṣa saṃśodhana artham duṣṭa stanya graha samutthānām ca vyādhīnām upaśamana artham || 	for cures of diseases originating from their malignant influences. Deals with the nursing and healthy bringing up of infants, with purification and bettering of mothers’ milk, found deficient in any of its characteristic traits, and also with cures for diseases peculiar to infant life and due to the use of vitiated mother’s milk or to the influences of malignant stars and spirits. 
agada tantram nāma sarpa kīṭa lūtā mūśikā ādi daṣṭa viṣa vyañjana artham vividha viṣa saṃyoga upaśamana artham ca || 	Deals with bites from snakes, spiders and venomous worms, and their characteristic symptoms and antidotes.

evam ayam āyurvedaḥ aṣṭāṅgaḥ upadiśyate atra kasmai kim ucyatām iti || 	Thus the entire science of the Ayurveda is classified into the eight preceding branches. 
te ūcuḥ asmākam sarveṣām eva śalya jñānam mūlam kṛtvā upadiśatu bhagavān iti || 	Now tell me, which of them is to be taught and to which of you? Said the disciples:—“Instruct us all, O Lord, in the science of surgery (Shalva) and let that be the chief subject of our study.” To which replied the holy Dhanvantari:—“Be it so.” Then the disciples again said:—“We are all of one mind in the matter, O Lord, that Sushruta shall be our spokesman and ask you questions conformably to the general trend of our purpose. 
te ūcuḥ bhūyas api bhagavantam asmākam ekamatīnām matam abhisamīkṣya suśrutaḥ bhagavantam prakṣyati asmai ca upadiśyamānam vayam api upadhārayiṣyāmaḥ || 	All of us will attentively hear what you will be pleased to discourse to Sushruta, [and that will save you the trouble of teaching us individually]”. 
sa ha uvāca evam astu iti || 	To which replied the venerable sage—“Be it so. 
vatsa suśrutaḥ iha khalu āyurveda prayojanam vyādhi upasṛṣṭānām vyādhi parimokaṣaḥ svasthasya rakṣaṇam ca || 	The object or utility of the science which forms the subject of our present discussion, may be grouped under two distinct sub-heads such as (1) the cure of diseased persons, and (2) the preservation of health in those who are not afflicted with any sort of bodily distempers.” 
āyuḥ asmin vidyate anena vai āyuḥ vindati iti āyurvedaḥ || 	The etymological meaning of the term “Ayurveda” may be interpreted to denote either a science in the knowledge of which life exists, or which helps a man to enjoy a longer duration of life. 
tasya aṅga varam ādyam pratyakṣa āgama anumāna upamānaiḥ aviruddham ucyamānam upadharaya || etat hi aṅgam prathamam prāk abhighāta vraṇa saṃrohāt yajña śiraḥ sandhānāt ca | 	The primary position of this branch of the ayurveda, (as regards its time or origin), may be inferred from the fact that Surgery lends her aid materially towards the healing up of traumatic ulcers.[5] The second reason for such an inference may be deduced from the replacement of the severed head of Yajna. 
śrūyate hi yathā rudreṇa yajñasya śiraḥ chinnam iti tatas devāḥ aśvinau abhigamya ūcuḥ bhagavantau naḥ śreṣṭhatamau yuvām bhaviṣyathaḥ bhavadbhyām yajñasya śeraḥ sandhātavyam iti | 	It is told that the god Rudra, severed the head of the God of Sacrifice (Yajna). Whereupon the gods approached the celestial Ashvins, and addressed them as follows:— “You twins, O lords, who are to be the greatest of us all, connect the head of Yajna with his decapitated trunk.” 
tau ūcatuḥ evam astu iti | 	To them, replied the divine Ashvins:— 
atha tayoḥ arthe devāḥ indram yajñabhagena prāsādayan | 	“We shall do, O lords, as you command us to do.” Then the celestials propitiated the god Indra in order that a portion of the oblations offered in the course of a sacrifice, might be allotted to those heavenly twins. 
tābhyām yajñasya śiraḥ saṃhitam iti || 	The Ashvins reunited the severed head of Yajna to his body as prayed for. 
aṣṭāsu api ca āyurveda tantreṣu etat eva adhikam abhimatam āma āśukriyā karaṇāt yantra śastra kṣāra agni praṇidhānāt sarva tantra sāmānyāt ca || 	All hold this Tantra to be the most important of all the other branches of the????????? instantaneous actions cab???????? of such appliances as, surgical operations, external applications of alkalis, cauterisation, etc., and secondly inasmuch as it contains all that can be found in the other branches of the science of medicine as well, with the superior advantage of producing instantaneous effects by means of surgical instruments and appliances. 
tat idam śāśvatam puṇyam svargyam yaśasyam āyuṣyam vṛtti karam ca iti || 	It is eternal and a source of infinite piety, imparts fame and opens the gates of Heaven to its votaries, prolongs the duration of human existence on earth, and helps men in successfully fulfilling their missions, and earning a decent competence, in life. 
brahmā provāca tatas prajāpatiḥ adhijage  tasmāt aśvinau aśvibhyām indraḥ indra ādaḥam mayā tu iha pradeyam arthibhyaḥ prajā hita hetoḥ || 	Prajapati learned the science from him. The Ashvins learned it from Prajapati and imparted the knowledge to Indra, who has favoured me (Dhanvantari) with an entire knowledge thereof. I, for the good of mankind, am ready to impart it to those ===== on earth. 
aham hi dhanvantariḥ ādidevaḥ jarā rujā mṛtyu haraḥ amarāṇām | 	It is I who warde???? disease and decay from the celestials. 
asmin śāstre pañca mahābhūta śarīri samavāyaḥ puruṣaḥ iti ucyate | 	In the present science (ayurveda), the Purusha (self-conscious organic individual) is described as the resultant of the combination of the soul and the five primary material principles.

The answer is, simply because the created world is composed of two distinct classes, such as the mobile and the immobile.[7] These two classes, in their turn, are further sub-divided for the purposes of the science of medicine into the two orders, agneya (hot) and Saumya (cool). Hence the world is composed of five material principles, though characterised by the twofold virtues, agneya (hot) and Saumya (cool).[8] 
tad duḥkha saṃyogāḥ vyādhayaḥ ucyante || te caturvidhāḥ āgantavaḥ śārīrāḥ mānasāḥ svābhāvikāḥ ca iti || 	particular disease, and that which proves a source of torment or pain to him, is denominated as a disease.[9] There are four different types of disease such as, Traumatic or of extraneous origin (agantuka), Bodily (Sharira), Mental (Manasa) and Natural (Svabhavika). 
teṣām āgantavaḥ abhighāta nimittāḥ || 	A disease due to an extraneous blow or hurt is called agantuka.

svābhāvikāḥ tu kṣudh pipāsā jarā mṛtyu nidrā prakṛtayaḥ || 	included within the category of mental (Manasa) distempers; whereas hunger, thirst, decrepitude, imbecility, death, sleep, etc. 
te ete manaḥ śarīra adhiṣṭhānāḥ || 	The Mind and the Body are the seats of the abovesaid distempers according as they are restricted to either of them, or affect both of them in unison.[10] 
teṣām saṃśodhana saṃśamana āhāra ācārāḥ samyak prayuktāḥ nigraha hetavaḥ || 	Samshodhana (Cleansing), and Samshamana (Pacification of the deranged or agitated bodily humours giving rise to the disease), and the regimen of diet and conduct are the four factors which should be duly employed in order to successfully cope with a disease.[11] 
prāṇinām punar mūlam āhāraḥ bala varṇa ojasām ca sa ṣaṭsu raseṣu āyattaḥ rasāḥ punar dravya āśrayāḥ dravyāṇi punar oṣadhayaḥ | 	Food is the principal factor which materially contributes to the strength, complexion and vitality (Ojah) of animated beings. Food consists of six different tastes (Rasa) [which cannot exist independently of the substances] in which they are inherent. 
tāḥ tu dvividhāḥ sthāvarāḥ jaṅgamāḥ ca || 	These substances which are called the Oshadhis may be divided into two classes such as the mobile and the immobile. 
tāsām sthāvarāḥ caturvidhāḥ vanaspatayaḥ vṛkṣāḥ vīrudhaḥ oṣadhayaḥ iti | 	The immobile Oshadhis in their turn, admit of being grouped under four sub-heads such as, the Vanaspatis, the Vrikshas, the Virudhas and the Oshadhis proper. 
tāsu apuṣpāḥ phalavantaḥ vanaspatayaḥ puṣpa phalavantaḥ vṛkṣāḥ pratānavatyaḥ stambinyaḥ ca vīrudhaḥ phala pāka niṣṭhāḥ oṣadhayaḥ iti || 	Those trees which bear fruit without blossoming are called the Vanaspatis such as, the Plaksha and the Oudumvura. Those that bear both fruits and flowers are called the Vrikshas. Shrubs and creepers that trail on the ground are called Virudhas, whereas those plants which die with the ripening of their fruits, are called Oshadhis proper (such as cereals;. 
jaṅgamāḥ khalu api catuvidhāḥ jarāyu ja aṇḍa ja sveda ja udbhijjāḥ | 	The mobile Oshadhis or animals' are divided into four classes such as the viviparous, the oviparous, the sweat-begotten, and those that are born of decomposed vegetable matter. 
tatra paśu manuṣya vyāla ādayaḥ jarāyu jāḥ khaga sarpa sarīsṛpa prabhṛtayaḥ aṇḍa jāḥ kṛmi kīṭa pipīlikā prabhṛtayaḥ sveda jāḥ indragopa maṇḍūka prabhṛtayaḥ udbhijjāḥ || 	Man and other mammals belong to the first group; birds, snakes, and reptiles belong to the second; ants, worms, etc. belong to the third; while frogs and Indragopas belong to the fourth. 
tatra sthāvarebhyaḥ tvac patra puṣpa phala mūla kanda niryāsa svarasa ādayaḥ prayojanavantaḥ jaṅgamebhyaḥ carma nakha roma rudhira ādayaḥ || 	For medicinal purposes, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, roots, bulbs, the expressed juice, and milky or resinous secretions of plants, etc.[12] are obtained from the vegetable world. 
pārthivāḥ suvarṇa rajata maṇi muktā manaḥśilā mṛd kapāla ādayaḥ || 	Metals and minerals such as gold, silver, gems, and Manahshila (Realgar), as well as pearls, clay and Kapalas (bones), etc. should be included in the list of the earthy substances.[13] 
kāla kṛtāḥ pravāta nivāta ātapa chāyā jyotsnā tamaḥ śīta uṣṇa varṣa ahorātra pakṣa māsa ṛtu ayana ādayaḥ saṃvatsara viśeṣāḥ || 	Gale, windfall, sunshine, shade, moonshine, darkness, heat, cold, rain, day, night, fortnight, month, seasons, and solstices, etc. 
te ete svabhāvataḥ eva doṣāṇām saṃcaya prakopa praśama pratīkāra hetavaḥ prayojanavantaḥ ca || 	should be deemed as the works of eternal time, which, by virtue of their natural effects, contribute to the accumulation, augmentation, pacification or diminution of the deranged bodily humours (such as, wind, etc.. 
śārīrāṇām vikārāṇām eṣa vargaḥ catuvidhaḥ | prakope praśame ca eva hetuḥ uktaḥ cikitsakaiḥ || 	Physicians should look upon these four factors of (food, conduct, earth and time), as the accumulators, aggravators and pacifiers of the deranged bodily humours and of the diseases resulting therefrom in man. 
manasi anye śarīre anye teṣām tu dvividhā kriyā || 	Diseases due to causes which are extraneous to the body may affect the mind or the body. 
śarīra patitānām tu śārīra vat upakramaḥ | mānasānām tu śabda ādiḥ iṣṭaḥ vargaḥ sukha āvahaḥ || 	When it would affect the body in the shape of any traumatic disease (such as an inflammation due to a blow or a sword cut), it should be treated medicinally like the rest of the physical maladies, while the remedy should consist in the enjoyment of pleasurable sounds, touch, sights, taste or smell where the mind would be found to be the seat of the distemper. 
evam etat puruṣaḥ vyādhiḥ auṣadham kriyā kālaḥ iti catuṣṭayam samāsena vyākhyātam  | tatra puruṣa grahaṇāt tad saṃbhava dravya samūhaḥ bhūta ādiḥ uktaḥ tad aṅga pratyaṅga vikalpāḥ ca tvac na aṃsa asthi sirā snāyu prabhṛtayaḥ vyādhi grahaṇāt vāta pitta kapha śoṇita saṃnipāta vaiṣamya nimittāḥ sarve eva vyādhayaḥ vyākhyātāḥ oṣadha grahaṇāt dravya rasa guṇa vīrya vipākānām ādeśaḥ kriyā grahaṇāt chedya ādīni sneha 	Thus I have briefly dealt with the Purusha, Disease, Medicine, Appliances and the Specific Time. The term Purusha should be interpreted to include within its meaning the combination of its five material components, and all things resulting therefrom, such as the limbs and members of the body, as well as the skin, the flesh, the blood, the veins and the nerves, etc. The term Disease signifies all distempers incidental to the several or combined actions of the three deranged bodily humours and blood. 
bījam cikitsitasya etat samāsena prakīrtitam | 	The term Medicine signifies drugs and their virtues, tastes, potency, inherent efficacy (Prabhava) and reactionary properties (Vipaka).

sa puṇya karmā bhuvi pūjitaḥ nṛpaiḥ asu kṣaye śakra salokatām vrajet || 	The man who reads this Eternal Science of Medicine (Ayurveda-Shastram) discoursed by the self-origined Brahma and propagated by the King of Kasi, becomes noted for his piety, is honoured by the kings on earth, and attains to the region of Indra (the lord of the celestials) after death.

atha atas śiṣyopanayanīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which deals with the rites of formal initiation of a pupil into the science of Medicine (Shishyopanayaniya-adhyaya).

A man possessed of contrary attributes should not be admitted into the sacred precincts of) medicine.

Then having drawn straight lines across the Sthandilam so as to meet the top of the furthest side of the square, and having sprinkled them over with holy water, the preceptor should lay down a blade of Kusha grass tied up in the form of a knot, known as the Brahmana, along the side of the sacred cushion to his right, and kindle the sacred fire close to his seat. 
khadira palāśa devadāru bilvānām samidbhiḥ caturṇām vā kṣīravṛkṣāṇām dadhi madhu ghṛta aktābhiḥ dārvī haumikena vidhinā sruveṇa ājya āhutīḥ juhuyāt sa praṇavābhiḥ mahāvyahṛtibhiḥ tatas pratidaivatam ṛṣīn ca svāhākāram kuryāt śiṣyam api kārayet || 	Then having soaked the twigs of the four sacrificial trees of Khadira, Palasha, Devadaru and Vilva, or of Vata, Oudumvara, Ashvattha and Madhuka in curd, honey and clarified butter, he should perform the rite of Homa according to the rules of a Darvi Homa ceremony. Then libations of clarified butter should be cast into the sacrificial fire with a repetition of the Maha Vyahriti Mantras preceded by the mystic Omkara. After that, libations of clarified butter should be cast into the fire in honour of each of the gods and Rishis (celestial physicians) invoked by repeating the Svaha Mantra, and the disciple should be made to do the same.[1] 
brāhmaṇaḥ trayāṇām varṇānām upanayanam kartum arhati rājanyaḥ dvayasya vaiśyaḥ vaiśyasya eva iti śūdram api kula guṇa saṃpannam mantra varjam anupanītam adhyāpayet iti eke || 	A Brahmana preceptor is competent to initiate a student belonging to any of the three twice-born castes. A Kshatriya preceptor can initiate a student of the Kshatriya or the Vaishya caste, while a Vaishya preceptor can initiate a student of his own caste alone. A Shudra student of good character and parentage may be initiated into the mysteries of the Ayurveda by omitting the Mantras enjoined to be recited on such an occasion.

In proper season thou shalt pair thy nails and clip thy hair and put on the sacred cloth, dyed brownish yellow, live the life of a truthful, self-controlled anchorite and be obedient and respectful towards thy preceptor. 
aham vā tvayi samyak vartamāne yadi anyathā darśī syām enaḥ bhāj bhaveyam aphala vidyaḥ ca || 	If I, on the other hand, treat thee unjustly even with thy perfect obedience and in full conformity to the terms agreed upon, may I incur equal sin with thee, and may all my knowledge prove futile, and never have any scope of work or display.

kṛṣṇe aṣṭamī tad nidhane ahanī dve śukle tathā api evam ahar dvisandhyam | 	The day of the new moon, the eighth day of the moon’s wane, the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, as well as the corresponding days in the bright one, the day of the full moon, and the meetings of day and night such as (morning and evening) are occasions when the study of the ayurveda is prohibited. 
akāla vidyut stanayitnu ghoṣe svatantra rāṣṭra kṣitipa vyathāsu || 	Similarly, a clap of thunder heard at an improper season (months of Pausha, Phalguna and Caitra), or a flash of lightning occurring at a time when such phenomena are naturally rare, or an evil befalling one’s country, relations, or king, should be deemed as occasions prohibiting the study of the ayurveda.

Then a lint plug (Varti) plastered over with the (paste) Kalka of sesamum, honey and clarified butter, and soaked in disinfectant (lit:—purifying medicines such as Ajagandha, etc.) should be inserted deep into the cavity of the wound. After that, a poultice made of officinal substances should be applied over it and the whole should be bound up with thick layers of tow (Kavalikas—such as the leaves and bark of the Indian figtree etc.) which are neither too irritant nor too cooling in their effect; and finally scraps of clean linen should be wound round them. 
tatas guggulu aguru sarjarasa vacā gaurasarṣapa cūrṇaiḥ lavaṇa nimba patra vimiśraiḥ ājya yuktaiḥ dhūpayet ājya śeṣeṇa ca asya prāṇān samālabheta || 	The limb, [or the affected part] should be subsequently fumigated with the fumes of pain-killing (anodyne) substances and also with those of drugs which are supposed to ward off all malignant spirits (from the bedside of the patient.)[3] Then it should be fumigated with the drugs, known as Guggulu, Vaca, white mustard, Saindhava and the leaves of the Nimva tree, soaked in clarified butter. 
kṛtyānām pratighāta artham tathā rakṣaḥ bhayasya ca | 	The rites of protection from the influences of baneful spirits, should then be performed by reciting the Mantra which runs as follows:—

mayā evam kṛta rakṣaḥ tvam dīrgham āyuḥ avāpnuhi || 	May thou acquire a long life through the protective energy of the prophylactic prayer (lit:—incantation now read by me. 
tatas kṛta rakṣam āturam āgāram praveśya ācārikam ādiśet || 	Then having protected the body of the patient with the recitation of the above Vedic Mantra, the surgeon shall see his patient taken to his own chamber, and prescribe the proper course of medicine and diet according to the exigencies of each case.

dvitīya divasa parimokṣaṇāt vigrathitaḥ vraṇaḥ cirāt upasaṃrohati tīvra rujaḥ ca bhavati || 	The bandage should not be loosened on the day following the lancing of a boil, as such a measure might give rise to a sort of excruciating pain and formation of knots in the wound and retard the process of granulation (healing). 
atas ūrdhvam doṣa kāla bala ādīn avekṣya kaṣāya ālepana bandha āhāra ācārān vedadhyāt || 	after fully considering the strength of the patient, the nature of the disease, and the then prevailing season of the year.

atha atas ṛtucaryam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which treats of the characteristic features of the different seasons of the year and their influence on health and drugs (Ritucarya-adhyaya).

Contrariety or non contrariety of the natural attributes of drugs or substances endued with characteristic tastes, such as sweet, etc., are brought about by time; and time is the principal factor that controls the births or deaths of beings. The Kala or the Eternal time is so called from the fact of its not suffering even one of its own minutest particles or subdivisions (Kala) to perish, though perpetually moving, and in constant motion in itself; or it derives its epithet from the.

Time taken in articulating any of the short vowels (such as A.

The two months known as Tapas and Tapasya (Magha and Phalguna) constitute the season of winter. 
te ete śīta uṣṇa varṣa lakṣaṇāḥ candra ādityayoḥ kāla vibhāga kara tvāt ayane dve bhavataḥ dakṣiṇam uttaram ca | 	These six seasons are respectively characterised by cold, heat, rains, etc. The two Ayanams are ushered in by the sun and the moon changing their respective courses in the heavens (passing over the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) as the measurers of time. The rains, autumn and Hemanta follow one another in succession when the sun is over the Tropic of Capricorn or is in the Winter Solstice (Dakshinayana) and the moon gains in strength in this part of the year.

Winter, spring and summer mark the passing of the sun over the Summer Solstice (Uttarayana).

tau ubhau api saṃśritya vāyuḥ pālayati prajāḥ || 	The moon imparts the moisture and humidity to the earth which is soaked up by the sun in his daily course, while the wind in conjunction with the sun and the moon, contributes towards the preservation of animal life.

Five such complete years count as a Yuga. The subdivisions of eternal time from the minutest Nimesha to a complete Yuga, are constantly revolving like a wheel, and this constant or perpetual revolution is called the wheel or cycle of time (Kala-Chakra) by certain authorities.

Water becomes muddy or turbid and the earth is covered over with fresh deposits of washed off or silted mud. The sky becomes overcast with clouds, and the wind, charged with an excess of humidity, dulls the appetite and organisms of beings.

Hence water and vegetables partaken of in Hemanta are divested of their properties of acid reaction after being assimilated in the human system, but they give rise to an accumulation of phlegm in the body owing to their heaviness, sliminess, and cooling and oily character. In spring, the phlegm thus accumulated in the body is liquefied and ushers in diseases due to a deranged state of that bodily humour.[2]

The sun’s rays dry up the natural moisture of the human system, and accordingly water and vegetables largely partaken of in summer, give rise to an accumulation of wind in the system owing to their lightness, dryness, or expansive and drought-making properties. Subsequently wind thus accumulated in the summer, is agitated by the rains and cold winds in the forepart of the rainy season (Pravrit) when the ground is flooded with water and thus gives rise to diseases which are incidental to a deranged state of the bodily wind.[3] 
tatra varśā hemanta grīṣmeṣu saṃcitānām doṣāṇām śarad vasanta prāvṛṭsu ca prakupitānām nirharaṇam kartavyam || 	augmented and accumulated during the rains, Hemanta and summer, should be checked as soon as they become aggravated (manifest themselves) in autumn, spring, or in the forepart of the rainy season (Pravrit).

Thus far we have discussed the accumulation, excitation and pacification or alleviation of the deranged bodily humours.

tatra avyāpanneṣu ṛtuṣu avyāpannāḥ oṣadhayaḥ bhavanti āpaḥ ca tāḥ upayujyamānāḥ prāṇa āyuḥ bala vīrya ojaskaryaḥ bhavanti || 	Water and vegetables retain their natural properties when the seasons are natural, and do not exhibit contrary features, and they then tend to increase the appetite, vitality, strength, and power of the human system. 
teṣām punar vyāpadaḥ adṛṣṭa kāritāḥ ṣīta uṣṇa vāta varṣāṇi khalu viparītāni oṣadhīḥ vyāpādayanti apaḥ ca || 	A season, exhibiting unnatural or contrary features, affects or reverses the natural properties of water and vegetables peculiar to it, which, drunk or partaken of, cause dreadful epidemics in the country.

Sometimes the pollens of poisonous flowers or grasses, etc., wafted by the winds, invade a town or a village, and produce a sort of epidemic cough, asthma, catarrh, or fever, irrespective of all constitutional peculiarities or deranged bodily humours agitated thereby(?). Towns and villages are known to have been depopulated through malignant astral influences, or through houses, wives[4], beds, seats, carriages, riding animals, gems and precious stones assuming inauspicious features.

yāpayet asādhyān na upakramet parisaṃvatsara utthitān ca vikārān prāyaśas varjayet || tatra sādhyāḥ api vyādhayaḥ prāyeṇa eṣām duścikitsyatamāḥ bhavanti | 	Having made these observations the physician will try to cure diseases that are curable, adopt palliative measures in cases where palliation is the only remedy that can be offered, and give up a case which is beyond all medical treatment, and mostly those which are of more than a year’s standing.

strībhiḥ saha āsyām saṃvāsam parihāsam ca varjayet | 	A physician should abjure the company of women, nor should he speak in private to them or joke with them.

iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne viśikhānupraveśanīyaḥ nāma daśamaḥ adhyāyaḥ || ekādaśaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the tenth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of the essential qualifications of a physician. 
atha atas kṣārapākavidhim adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which treats of the pharmacy of alkalis or potential cauteries (Kshara-paka-vidhi-madhyaya). 
śastra anuśastrebhyaḥ kṣāraḥ pradhānatamaḥ chedya bhedya lekhya karaṇāt tridoṣa ghnavāt viśeṣa kriyā avacāraṇāt ca || 	In cases that require incising, excising and scraping, alkalis or alkaline preparations are of greater importance than surgical instruments and appliances (both principal and secondary or substitutive, as they are possessed of the virtues of subduing the three deranged bodily humours (such as wind, bile and phlegm). 
tatra kṣaraṇāt kṣaṇanāt vā kṣāraḥ || 	The etymological signification of the term Kshara (alkalis) is based on their property of corroding (the skin or the flesh of an affected part of the body), or on their peculiar quality in destroying the skin and flesh (where such an effect is desired). 
nānā oṣadhi samavāyāt tridoṣa ghnaḥ śukla tvāt saumyaḥ tasya saumyasya api sataḥ dahana pacana dāraṇa ādi śaktiḥ aviruddhā sa khalu āgneya oṣadhi guṇa bhūyiṣṭha tvāt kaṭukaḥ uṣṇaḥ tīkṣṇaḥ pacanaḥ vilayanaḥ śodhanaḥ ropaṇaḥ śoṣaṇaḥ stambhanaḥ lekhanaḥ kṛmi āma kapha kuṣṭha viṣa medasām upahantā puṃstvasya ca atisevitaḥ || 	But since many drugs or substances of a hot or fiery nature (agneya) enter into their composition, Ksharas (alkalis) are endued with the properties of blistering, burning, suppurating (Pacana), opening etc., without involving any contradiction to their generic (Saumya) nature, and lienee they are included within the list of those substances which are both hot and cooling (Saumya and agneya in their virtues. 
sa dvividhaḥ pratisāraṇīyaḥ pānīyaḥ ca || 	Kshara (caustics) may be grouped under two distinct heads according to their mode of administration), such as the Pratisaraniya (for external application) and the Pania (alkaline potions).

pānīyaḥ tu gara gulmodara agnisaṅga ajīrṇa arocaka ānāha śarkarā aśmarya abhyantara vidradhi kṛmi viṣa arśaḥsu upayujyate || 	Alkaline potions or any other internal use of alkalis, should be prescribed in cases of Gulma (abdominal glands), Ascites, loss of appetite, indigestion, flatulent distension of the abdomen with suppression of stool and urine, urinary calculi, stone in the bladder, internal abscesses, worms in the intestines and hemorrhoids, as well as for subduing or eliminating any sort of poison from the system. 
ahitaḥ tu raktapitta jvaritapitta prakṛti bāla vṛddha durbala bhrama mada mūrchā timira parītebhyaḥ anyebhyaḥ ca evaṃvidhebhyaḥ || 	Alkalis or alkaline potions will prove positively injurious to a patient laid up with fever or hemoptysis, to a man of bilious temperament, to an infant, or to an old man, and they will work similar mischief in a weak person, or in a patient suffering from vertigo, insensibility, syncope and Timira (darkness of vision). 
tam ca itara kṣāra vat dagdhvā parisrāvayet tasya vistaraḥ anyatra || 	These preparations of Alkalis should be made in one and the same way by filtering; and we reserve the full description of this process for another occasion. 
atha itaraḥ trividhaḥ mṛduḥ madhyaḥ tīkṣṇaḥ ca | 	Alkalis for external application are prepared in three different potencies; the mild, middling and strong (extremely irritant. 
tam cikīrṣuḥ śaradi girisānujam śuciḥ upoṣya praśaste ahani praśasta deśa jātam anupahatam madhyama vayasam mahāntam asita muṣkakam adhivāsya aparedyus pāṭayitvā su aṇḍaśas prakalpya avapāṭya nirvāte deśe nicitim kṛtvā sudhā śarkarāḥ ca prakṣipya nila nālaiḥ ādīpayet | 	Then having ascended the brow of a hill, he should select a full grown Ashita-mushka (Ghanta parul) tree of middle age, and growing on soil recommended in the works on pharmacy and not anywise affected. 
atha upaśānte agnau tat bhasma pṛthak gṛhṇīyāt bhasma śarkarāḥ ca | 	Then after the fire has fairly burnt itself out, the ashes of the limestone and the Ghanta-parula wood should be separately collected and stored.

The (alkaline water filtered as above) should be kept in a large caldron over a fire and boiled by gently agitating it with a ladle.. 
sa yadā bhavati acchaḥ raktaḥ tīkṣṇaḥ picchilaḥ ca tam ādāya mahati vastre parisrāvya itaram vibhajya punar agnau idhiśrayet | 	It should be taken down from the fire when by gradual stirring, the saturated water would appear transparent, slimy, red and irritating. 
tatas eva cakṣāra udakāt kuḍavam adhyardham vā apanayet | 	After this a Kudava measure and a half (12 Palas) of the (abovesaid) saturated or alkaline water should be taken out of the caldron, and the rest should be again kept boiling over the fire.

Then having immersed eight Pala measures of the substances known as the Shankhanabhi etc., in the abovesaid alkaline water, the physician should boil it by continuous and steady stirring, care being taken not to make it of too thin nor of tod thick a consistency. 
atha enam āgata pākam avatārya anuguptam āyase kumbhe saṃvṛta mukhe nidadhyāt eṣa madhyamaḥ || 	Then the basin or the caldron should be taken down from the oven, and its contents poured into an iron pitcher, carefully covering its mouth after filling it.

teṣām yathā vyādhi balam upayogaḥ || 	These alkaline preparations of different potencies, should be severally used in cases where their administrations would be clearly indicated. 
kṣīṇa bale tu kṣāra udakam āvapet bala karaṇa artham || 	An alkaline preparation, any way weakened, should be strengthened by adding to it alkaline water (water saturated with an alkali) as before described. 
na eva ati tīkṣṇaḥ na mṛduḥ śuklaḥ ślakṣṇaḥ atha picchilaḥ | 	The commendable features in an alkali are based on its whiteness, on its being neither too mild nor too strong, on its gloss and sliminess, on its sticking to the place of application, and on its power of secreting (Abhisyandi) the morbid fluid, and on its rapid effect. 
sāndra tā apakva tā hīna dravya tā doṣaḥ ucyate || 	On the other hand, its defective traits consist in its being too mild, of excessive whiteness, excessive strength or irritability, of over-sliminess, excessive stickiness or thickness, insufficient boiling, and insufficiency of component ingredients. 
tatra kṣāra sādhya vyādhi vyādhitam upaveśya nivāta ātape deśe asaṃbādhe agra upaharaṇīya uktena vidhānena upasaṃbhṛta saṃbhāram tatas asya tam avakāśam nirīkṣya avaghṛṣya avalikhya pracchayitvā śalākayā kṣāram pratisārayet dattvā vāc śata mātram upekṣeta || 	A patient laid up with a disease amenable to an application of alkali (potential cautery or caustic) should be kept in a spacious chamber, and should not be exposed to draughts and to the hot rays of the sun, [Then the physician having secured] the necessary appliances etc, as already laid down in the Chapter V, should view the part of the patient’s body to which the alkali is to be applied. 
tasmin nipatite vyādhau kṛṣṇa tā dagdha lakṣaṇam | 	The perfect burning (blistering should be inferred from the black colour of the skin of the affected part. 
tatra amlavargaḥ śamanaḥ sarpiḥ madhuka saṃyutaḥ || 	Madhuka and the substances included within the Amla-varga (group of acid drugs) pasted with clarified butter, should be applied to allay the incidental burning (sensation). 
amla kāñjika bījāni tilān madhukam eva ca prapeṣya sama bhāgāni tena enam anulepayet || 	Madhuka and the Kalka paste of sesamum mixed with clarified butter would cause such an (incidental) ulcer to heal. 
āgneyena agninā tulyaḥ katham kṣāraḥ praśāmyati | 	Now you may ask the question how can an acid substance, which is fiery in its virtue and heat-making in its potency, tend to subdue the effects of an alkali which is possessed of similar virtues and properties, instead of augmenting them, as can naturally be apprehended? Well my child, the question can be fairly answered by stating, that substances of all tastes enter into the composition of an alkali except the acid one. 
kaṭukaḥ tatra bhūyiṣṭhaḥ lavaṇaḥ anurasaḥ tathā | 	The pungent (Katu) taste is the principal taste of an alkali, while the saline (Lavana) forms its minor or accessory flavour (Anurasa). 
amlena saha saṃyuktaḥ sa tīkṣṇalavaṇaḥ rasaḥ || mādhuyam bhajate atyartham tīkṣṇa bhāvam vimuñcati | 	Now this saline taste in conjunction with the acid one renounces its extremely sharp or irritating property and is thus transformed into one of sweetness or of soothing virtue. 
mādhuryāt śamam āpnoti vahniḥ adbhiḥ iva āplutaḥ || 	Hence it is that an acid taste tends to allay the burning incidental to an application of alkali (potential caustic) in the same way as water tends to put out fire. 
tatra samyak dagdhe vikāra upaśamaḥ lāghavam anāsrāvaḥ ca || 	An operation of perfect cauterisation with an alkaline application brings about an amelioration of the disease, or the disease is entirely subdued, accompanied by lightness of the limbs and absence of secretion from the affected part; while an insufficient burning [of the part] is generally attended by symptoms of aggravation of the malady and also gives rise to local pain, itching and numbness. 
hīna dagdhe toda kaṇḍu jāḍyāni vyādhi vṛddhiḥ ca || 	[On the other hand], excessive burning [of the part] with an alkaline preparation may have a fatal termination, and is attended by such symptoms as burning, suppuration, redness, secretion in and from the seat of affection. 
ati dagdhe dāha pāka rāga srāva aṅgamarda klama pipāsā mūrchāḥ syuḥ maraṇam vā || 	A feeling of languor and fatigue comes upon the patient accompanied with thirst, swooning and an aching sensation. 
kṣāra dagdha vraṇam tu yathādoṣam yathādoṣam yathāvyādhi ca upakramet || 	An ulcer incidental to a burn by an alkali should be treated with a special eye to the nature of the disease and the deranged bodily humour specifically involved in the case.

tatra kṣāra sādhyeṣu api vyādhiṣu śūna gātram asthi śūlinam anna dveṣiṇam hṛdaya sandhi pīḍā upadrutam ca kṣāraḥ na sādhayati || 	Alkalis fail to produce any beneficial effect in a patient suffering from edema of the limbs, or suffering from bone-ache, or laid up with a disease affecting the joints or the heart, or in a person of impaired appetite who has lost all relish for food, even when their use is otherwise indicated. 
viṣa agni śastra aśani mṛtyu kalpaḥ kṣāraḥ bhavati alpa mati prayuktaḥ 	An Alkali administered by an ignorant physician is to be dreaded more than poison, fire, blows with a weapon, thunder-bolts, or death itself; while in the hand of an intelligent physician it is potent enough to speedily subdue all serious diseases in which its use is indicated. 
iti śrī suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne kṣārapākavidhiḥ nāma ekādaśaḥ adhyāyaḥ || 	Thus ends the eleventh Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of the Pharmacy of Alkalis. 
dvādaśaḥ adhyāyaḥ | atha atas agnikarmavidhim adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which treats of cauteries and the rules to be observed in their use (Agni-Karma-Vidhi-adhyaya). 
kṣārāt agniḥ garīyān kriyāsu vyākhyātaḥ tad dagdhānām rogāṇām apunarbhāvāt bheṣaja śastra kṣāraiḥ asādhyānām sat sādhya tvāt ca || 	A disease burnt with fire, is cured for good and knows no recrudescence; and diseases which ordinarily baffle the skill of a surgeon or a physician, and never prove themselves amenable to medicinal or surgical remedies, are found to yield to fire (cauterisation). 
atha imāni dahana upakaraṇāni tat yathā pippalī ajā śakṛt godanta śara śalākā jāmbava oṣṭha itara lauhāḥ kṣaudra guḍa snehāḥ ca | 	The following drugs, articles and substances should be understood as accessories to an act of cauterisation, viz., Pippali, the excreta of goats, the tooth of a cow (Godanta), Shara, a rod, the surgical instrument known as the Jamvavaustha, articles made of copper or silver, honey, treacle, oil, or any other oily substance.

sarva vyādhiṣu ṛtuṣu ca picchilam annam bhuktavataḥ (? karma kurvīta 	In all diseases and in all seasons of the year, the patient should be fed on a diet of slimy (mucilaginous) food before actually applying the cautery; while the patient should be kept on an empty stomach before the act where the complaint would be a case of Mudagarbha (false presentation), fistula in ano, hemorrhoids or a disease affecting the cavity of the mouth.

A burn, which is not deep (superficial) and assumes the colour of a ripe Tala fruit, and does not present a raised or elevated aspect and develops the preceding symptoms, is called the Samyag-Dagdha (fully burnt one). A burn in which the flesh hangs down, and where the veins, nerves and bones are destroyed, accompanied with fever, burning, thirst, fainting and such like disturbances, and which leads to a permanent disfiguration of the body, retarding the healing of the incidental ulcer which leaves a discoloured cicatrix even after healing, is called the Ati-Dagdha (over burnt one).

tasmāt sukhayati hi uṣṇam na tu śītam kathaṃcana || 	Hence warm fomentations or applications exercise curative virtues in the case of a burn of the foregoing type, and water or cold applications produce the contrary effect.[1]

pitta vidradhi vat ca enam santata ūṣmāṇam ācaret || 	A burn of the present type, marked by excessive burning, should be medicinally treated in the same manner as a case of bilious abscess (Pitta-vidradhi). 
ati dagdhe viśīrṇāni māṃsāni uddhṛtya śītalām | 	In the case of a burn of the Ati-Dagdha (over-burnt) type, the loose or the dangling integuments (skin) and flesh should be removed, and cold applications should be made over the ulcer.

madhūcchiṣṭam sa madhukam rodhram sarjarasam tathā || 	A plaster composed of bee’s wax, Madhuka, Sarjarasa, Manjistha, (red) Chandana and Murva pasted together and boiled with clarified butter should be regarded as beneficial to burns of all types to promote rapid healing.

atas ūrdhvam pravakṣyāmi dhūma upahata lakṣaṇam || śvasiti kṣauti ca atyartham atyādham ati kāsate | 	Now we shall describe the symptoms which become manifest in a person [whose nostrils and larynx] are choked with smoke.—The respiration becomes laboured and hurried and the abdomen is distended accompanied by constant sneezing and coughing. 
cakṣuṣoḥ paridāhaḥ ca rāgaḥ ca eva upajāyate || 	The eyes look red and seem as if burning. 
sa dhūmakam niśvasiti ghreyam anyat na vetti ca | 	The patient breathes out smoke and fails to catch any other smell than that of it. 
tathā eva ca rasān sarvān śrutiḥ ca asya upahanyate || tṛṣṇā dāha jvara yutaḥ sīdati atha ca mūrchati | 	The sense of hearing is considerably affected; the sense of taste becomes inert; fever, thirst and a burning sensation supervene; and the patient drops down utterly unconscious. 
dhūma upahataḥ iti evam śṛṇu tasya cikitsitam || sarpiḥ ikṣu rasam drākṣām payaḥ vā śarkarā ambu vā | 	Now hear me discourse on the course of medical treatment to be adopted in the case of one over-powered with smoke.—Emetics in the shape of clarified butter mixed with sugarcane juice or milk saturated with the juice of grapes, or lumps of sugar-candy dissolved in an adequate quantity of water, or any acid potion slightly sweetened, should be administered to the patient. 
vamataḥ koṣṭha śuddhiḥ syāt dhūma gandhaḥ ca naśyati | vidhinā anena śāmyanti sadana kṣavathu jvarāḥ || dāha mūrchā tṛṣ ādhmāna śvāsa kāsāḥ ca dāruṇāḥ | 	The contents of the stomach are speedily discharged by vomiting; the distension of the abdomen is removed; the smell of smoke in the breath is mitigated, and the accompanying fever,with (its concomitants) of sneezing, languor, thirst, cough, laboured breathing etc.

iti śrī suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne agnikarmavidhaiḥ nāma dvādaśaḥ adhyāyaḥ || trayodaśaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the twelfth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of Cauteries and the rules to be observed in their use. 
atha atas jalaukāvacāraṇīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which treats of leeches and of how and which to use (Jalauka-vacaraniya-adhyaya). 
nṛpa āḍhya bāla sthavira bhīru durbala nārī sukumārāṇām anugraha artham parama sukumāraḥ ayam śoṇita avasecana upāyaḥ abhihitaḥ jalaukasaḥ || 	Leeches should be applied where the patient would be found to be old or imbecile, or a woman, or an infant, or a person of an extremely timid disposition, or a person of a delicate constitution, and as such is not fit to be surgically operated upon, since this mode of bleeding is the gentlest that can be possibly devised. 
tatra vāta pitta kapha duṣṭa śoṇitam yathāsaṃkhyam śṛṅga jalauka ulābubhiḥ avasecayet snigdha śīta rūkṣa tvāt sarvāṇi sarvaiḥ vā || 	The blood vitiated by the deranged wind (Vayu), bile (Pitta), and phlegm (Kapha) should be respectively sucked through a horn, by leeches and a gourd appliance (Alavu-Yantra) or with whichsoever of them is available at the time, irrespective of the cause of such vitiation, whenever such bleeding or sucking would be found to be imperatively necessary. 
uṣṇam sa madhura snigdham gavām śṛṅgam prakīrtitam 	A cowhorn is described in the Shastras as of a hot or heat making potency, and as possessed of a slightly cooling (Snigdha) or soothing (Madhura) property. 
tasmāt vāta upasṛṣṭe tu hitam tat avasecane || 	Accordingly it should be used in sucking the blood vitiated through the action of the deranged bodily wind. 
śīta adhivāsā madhurā jalaukā vārisaṃbhavā tasmāt pitta upasṛṣṭe tu hitā sā tu avasecane || 	Leeches, which are born in water, are possessed of Madhura (sweet or soothing) properties, and hence they should be used in sucking the blood vitiated through a deranged condition of the bile (Pitta). 
alābu kaṭukam rūkṣam tīkṣṇam ca parikīrtitam 	The gourd (Alavu) is pungent, parching and irritating in its potency and should be therefore used in sucking the blood vitiated through the action of the deranged phlegm (Kapha). 
tatra pracchite tanu vasti paṭala avanaddhena śrṅgeṇa śoṇitam avasecayet ācūṣaṇāt sa antardīpayā alābvā || 	The part from which the blood is to be sucked should be first scarified or slightly cut in two or three places, and then the mouth or the open end, of the horn, covered with a thin piece of muslin tied round its edges should be placed over it and sucked with the mouth through the aperture at its tip or top-end, or with a gourd appliance equipped with a lighted lamp placed in its inside. 
jalam āsām āyuḥ iti jalāyukāḥ jalam āsām okaḥ iti jalaukasaḥ || 	The term Jalauka (leeches) may be etymologically interpreted to mean creatures whose life (Ayu) or whose longevity is in, or depends upon, water, whereas the derivative meaning of the term Jalauka (leeches) is based upon the fact of their dwelling (“Oka”—dwelling place) in water (Jala). 
tāḥ dvādaśa tāsām sa viṣāḥ ṣaṭ tāvatyaḥ eva nirviṣāḥ || 	Leeches may be divided into twelve distinct species of which six are venomous, and six non-venomous. 
tatra sa viṣāḥ kṛṣṇā karburāḥ alagardāḥ indrāyudhā sāmudrikā gocandanā ca iti | 	The six venomous species are named Krishna, Karvura, Alagarda, Indrayudha, Samudrika and Gochandana.

The skins of the Samudrikas are blackish yellow, dotted over with white spots of a variety of shapes. Leeches which are provided with narrow mouths and are marked by bifurcating line at the bottom like the scrotal sac of a buil are called Gochandanas. 
tābhiḥ daṣṭe puruṣe daśe śvayathuḥ atimātram kaṇḍūḥ mūrchā jvaraḥ dāhaḥ chardiḥ madaḥ sadanam iti liṅgāni bhavanti | 	Fever, with burning, retching, drowsiness and delirium supervenes and ultimately the patient loses all consciousness. 
tatra mahā gadaḥ pāna ālepana nasya karma ādiṣu upayojyaḥ | 	The remedy consists in the administration of an anti-toxic medicine known as Mahagada, as snuffs, potions and unguents, etc. 
indrāyudhāt aṣṭam asādhyam | 	A bite by an Indrayudha usually proves fatal. 
iti etāḥ sa viṣāḥ sa cikitsitāḥ vyākhyātāḥ || 	Venomous leeches, as well as cures for their bites, have thus been described. 
atha nirviṣāḥ kapilā piṅgalā śaṅkumukhī mūṣikā puṇḍarīkamukhī sāvarikā ca iti | 	The non-venomous species include Kapilas, Pingalas, Shankhamukhis, Musikas, Pundarimukhis and Saravikas.

tāsām yavana pāṇḍya sahyapautana ādīni kṣetrāṇi teṣu mahā śarīrāḥ balavatyaḥ śīghra pāyinyaḥ mahā aśanāḥ nirviṣāḥ ca viśeṣeṇa bhvanti | 	The leeches, found in the aforesaid countries, are specifically non-venomous, strong, large-bodied, greedy and ready suckers. 
tatra sa viṣa matsya kīṭa dardura mūtra purīṣa kotha jātāḥ kaluṣeṣu ambhaḥsu ca sa biṣāḥ padma utpala nalina kumuda saugandhika kuvalaya puṇḍarīka śaivala kotha jātāḥ vimaleṣu ambhaḥsu ca nirviṣāḥ || bhavati ca atra | 	The venomous leeches have their origin in the decomposed urine and fecal matter of toads and venomous fishes in pools of stagnant and turbid water. 
kṣetreṣu vicaranti etāḥ salila āḍhya sugandhiṣu | 	The non-venomous leeches swim about in sweet scented waters, live on non-poisonous weeds, lie on the leaves of flowering water plants instead of on the dank and oozy beds of pools, and suck blood from the affected part of a human organism without causing any discomfort. 
atha enām nave mahati ghaṭe saraḥ taḍāga udaka paṅkam āvāpya nidadhyāt bhakṣya arthe ca āsām upaharet śaivalam vallūram audakān ca kandān cūrṇīkṛtya śayyā artham tṛṇam audakāni ca patrāṇi tri ahāt tri ahāt ca ābhyaḥ anyat jalam bhakṣyam ca dadyāt sapta rātrāt sapta rātrāt ca ghaṭam anyam saṃkrāmayet || 	Leeches should be caught hold of with a piece of wet leather, or by some similar article, and then put in to a large-sized new pitcher filled with the water and ooze or slime of a pool. Pulverised zoophytes and powder of dried meat and aquatic bulbs should be thrown into the pitcher for their food, and blades of grass and leaves of water-plants should be put into it for them to lie upon. The water and the edibles should be changed every second or third day, and the pitchers should be changed each week, (the leeches should be transferred to a new pitcher at the end of every consecutive seven days). 
sthūla madhyāḥ parikliṣṭāḥ pṛthvyaḥ manda viceṣṭitāḥ a grāhinyaḥ alpa pāyinyaḥ sa viṣāḥ ca na pūjitāḥ || 	Leeches that are venomous, thick about the middle, elongated, of slow locomotion, look fatigued, do not readily take to the part they are applied to, and capable of sucking only a small quantity of blood, should be looked upon as not belonging to the proper or the commendable type. 
atha jalaukaḥ vaseka sādhya vyādhitam upaveśya saṃveśya vā virūkṣya ca asya tam avakāśam mṛd gomaya cūrṇaiḥ yadi arujaḥ syāt | 	hen having seated or laid down the patient suffering from a disease which requires the application of leeches, the seat of bleeding, if not previously ulcerated, should be roughened by dusting it over with a composition of loose earth and pulverised cowdung. 
gṛhītāḥ ca tāḥ sarṣapa rajanī kalka udaka pradigdha gātrīḥ salila saraka madhye muhūrta sthitāḥ vigata klamāḥ jñātvā tābhiḥ rogam grāhayet | 	Then for a moment they should be kept in a basin full of water, and after they have regained their natural vivacity and freshness, they should be applied to the affected part. 
ślakṣṇa śukla ārdra picu prota avacchannām kṛtvā mukham apāvṛṇuyāt a gṛhṇantyai kṣīra bindum śoṇita bindum vā dadyāt śastra padāni vā kurvīta yadi evam api na gṛhṇīyāt tadā anyām grāhayet || 	The affected part should be sprinkled over with drops of milk or blood, or slight incisions should be made into it in the event of their refusing to stick to the desired spot. 
yadā ca niviśate aśva khura vat ānanam kṛtvā unnamya ca skandham tadā jānīyāt gṛhṇāti iti ca ārdra vastra avacchannām dhārayet secayet ca || 	A sensation of itching and of a drawing pain at the seat of the application would give rise to the presumption that fresh blood was being sucked, and the leeches should be forthwith removed.[1] 
daṃśe toda kaṇḍu prādurbhāvaiḥ jānīyāt śuddham iyam ādatte iti śuddham ādadānām apanayet atha śoṇita gandhena na muñcet mukham asyāḥ saindhava cūrṇena avakiret || 	Leeches refusing to fall off even after the production of the desired effect, or sticking to the affected part out of their fondness for the smell of blood, should be sprinkled with the dust of powdered Saindhava (rock salt.) 
atha pati atām taṇḍula kaṇḍana pradigdha gātrīm taila lavaṇa abhyakta mukhīm vāma hasta aṅguṣṭha aṅgulībhyām gṛhīta pucchām dakṣiṇa hasta aṅguṣṭha aṅgulibhyām śanais śanais anulomam anumārjayet āmukhāt vāmayet tāvat yāvat samyak vānta liṅgāni iti | 	After falling off, the leeches should be dusted over with rice powder and their mouths should be lubricated with a composition of oil and common salt. 
yā sīdatī na ceṣṭate sā durvāntā tām punar samyak vāmayet | 	These should be made to disgorge again. 
durvāntāyāḥ vyādhiḥ asādhyaḥ indramadaḥ nāma bhavati | 	Leeches not made to emit the entire quantity of the sucked blood stand in danger of being attacked with an incurable disease peculiar to their genus, and which is known as Indramada. 
atha suvāntām pūrvavat sannidadhyāt || 	The leeches should then be put into a new pitcher, and treated as before laid down, after they had fully emitted the sucked blood. 
śoṇitasya ca yoga ayogān avekṣya śatadhauta ghṛta abhyaṅgaḥ tad picu dhāraṇam vā jalaukaḥ vraṇān madhunā avaghaṭṭayet śitābhiḥ adbhiḥ ca pariṣecayet badhnīta vā kaṣāya madhura snigdha śītaiḥ ca pradehaiḥ pradihyāt id || 	An ulcer incidental to an application of leeches should be rubbed with honey or washed with sprays of cold water, or bound up with an astringent (kashaya) sweet and cooling plaster, according to the quantity of blood removed from the part.[2] 
jalaukasām ca yaḥ vetti tad sādhyān sa jayet gadān || 	The physician who is fully conversant with the habitat, mode of catching, preservation and application of leeches, can well aspire to cure the diseases which yield to them or in which their use is indicated. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne jalaukāvacāraṇīyaḥ nāma trayodaśaḥ adhyāyaḥ || 	Thus ends the thirteenth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of Leeches and of how and which to use. 
atha atas śoṇitavarṇanīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which treats of blood (Shonita-Varnaniya-adhyaya). 
tatra pāñcabhautikasya caturvidhasya ṣaṣ rasasya dvividha vīryasya aṣṭavidhā vīryasya vā aneka guṇasya upayuktasya āhārasya samyak pariṇatasya yaḥ tejaḥ bhūtaḥ sāraḥ parama sūkṣmaḥ sa rasaḥ iti ucyate tasya ca hṛdayam sthānam sa hṛdayāt caturviṃśtim dhamanīḥ anupraviśya ūrdhva gāḥ daśa daśa ca adhogāminyaḥ catasraḥ ca tiryaggāḥ kṛtsnam śarīram aharahar tarpayati vardhayati dhārayati yāpayati ca adṛṣṭa hetukena karmaṇā 	The food of a human being, which is usually composed of the five fundamental material principles, admits of being classified under four different heads [as, drinks and edibles, etc.]. It has six different tastes or is of two [cooling or heat-making] potencies, or consists of eightfold properties, [ viz. hot, cool, dry, expansive, slimy, mild, sharp, etc.] and of a variety of other active or efficacious virtues. 
tasya śarīram anusarataḥ anumānāt gatiḥ upalakṣayitavyā kṣaya vṛddhi vaikṛtaiḥ | 	The nature and course of this lymph chyle, which runs through the whole system, can be inferred from the growth, attenuation, or other modified conditions of the body. 
tasmin sarva śarīra avayava doṣa dhātu mala āśaya anusāriṇi rase jijñāsā kim ayam saumyaḥ taijasaḥ iti | 	Now it may be asked, whether the Rasa, which permeates the entire body and limbs, and which by flowing through different chambers (visceras) of the body is thus in constant contact with the excreta and other morbid humours, is of a cooling (Saumya) or heat-making (agneya) potency? 
atra ucyate sa khalu drava anusārī snehana jīvana tarpaṇa dhāraṇa ādibhiḥ viśeṣaiḥ saumyaḥ iti avagamyate || 	The question may be answered by stating that, since the Rasa or lymph chyle is a fluid, and possessed of lubricating, vitalising, moistening, and nutritive (lit:—supporting) properties, it must be included within the class of Saumya (cooling) substances. 
sa khalu āpyaḥ rasaḥ yakṛt plīhānau prāpya rāgam upaiti || 	The Rasa, though a Saumya fluid, obtains its characteristic pigment (Ragam) in its passage through the spleen and liver. 
rasāt eva striyāḥ raktam rajaḥ saṃjñam pravartate | 	The Rasa or the lymph chyle, coloured through the effect of the healthy normal dyeing heat of the body, obtains the name of blood. 
tad varṣāt dvyādaśāt ūrdhvam yāti pañcāśataḥ kṣayam || 	The Rasa is transformed into the catamenial flow in women which commences at the age of twelve and ceases at fifty. 
pāñcabhautikam tu apare jīvaraktam āhuḥ ācāryāḥ || 	Hence several authorities hold the blood to be identical with the life blood or with the vital principle of a living organism, and being such, to be the product of the five fundamental material principles (Pancabhautika). 
vesra tā drava tā rāgaḥ spandanam laghu tā tathā bhūmi ādīnām guṇāḥ hi ete dṛśyante ca atra śoṇite || 	In blood the properties such as, a raw or fleshy smell, fluidity, redness, lightness and mobility, which respectively characterise the fundamental principles (of earth, water, fire, air, and sky) are to be found thus representing those specific elements in its composition. 
rasāt raktam tatas māṃsam māṃsāt medaḥ prajāyate | 	The chyle produces blood. From blood is formed flesh. From flesh originates fat which gives rise to bones. 
medasaḥ asthi tatas majjā majjñaḥ śukram tu jāyate || 	From bones originate marrow, which, in its turn, germinates semen. 
tatra eṣām dhātūnām anna pāna rasaḥ prīṇayitā || 	The Rasa which is originated from the digested or assimilated food and drink pre-eminently strengthens all the fundamental principles of the body. 
rasa jam puruṣam vidyāt rasam rakṣet prayatnaḥ | 	The Purusha or self-conscious personality is Chyle-born in its origin, and hence an intelligent person should carefully preserve his bodily Rasa (lymph chyle) by adopting a proper regimen of diet and conduct. 
tatra rasa gatau dhātuḥ aharahar gacchati iti atas rasaḥ || 	The term Rasa is derived from the root “Ras”, to go, and the substance is so called from the fact of its continually flowing through and permeating every vital principle of an animated organism. 
sa khalu trīṇi trīṇi kalā sahasrāṇi pañcadaśa ca kalāḥ ekaikasmin dhātau avatiṣṭhate evam māsena rasaḥ śukrībhavati strīṇām ca ārtavam || 	The Rasa is successively transformed into each of the six remaining fundamental principles of the body, and continues in the shape of each for the period of three thousand and fifteen kalas (five days according to our modern computation). Thus the Rasa is converted into semen, or into the menstrual blood (ovum) in women, in the course of a month.[2] 
aṣṭādaśa sahasrāṇi saṅkhyā hi asmin samuccaye | kalānām navatiḥ proktā svatantra paratantrayoḥ || 	In the present work, as well as in other works of recognised authority, a month is calculated to consist of eighteen thousand and ninety Kalas. 
sa śabda arciḥ jala santāna vat aṇunā viśeṣeṇa anudhāvati evam śarīram kevalam || 	The said Rasa courses through the whole body in invisible currents of zigzag shape, like the waves of sound, or in (an upward direction) like flames of fire, or (in a downward direction) like rivulets of water. 
vājīkaraṇyaḥ tu oṣadhayaḥ sva bala guṇa utkarṣāt virecana vat upayuktāḥ śukram virecayanti || 	Now it may be asked, since the Rasa is naturally transformed into semen in.the course of a month, what is the use of administering medicine which has a stimulating effect upon the organs of generation (Vajikarana.) The answer is, that such medicines out of their own specific potencies and virtue help the speedy conversion of Rasa into semen and its profuse emission [on the desired occasion] like purgatives aiding the drastic evacuation of the bowels. 
yathā hi puṣpa mukula sthaḥ gandhaḥ na śakyam iha asti iti vaktum atho na eva asti iti athavā kevalam saukṣmyāt na abhivyajyate saḥ eva puṣpe vivṛta patra keśare kāla antareṇa abhivyaktim gacchati evam bālānām api vayaḥ pariṇāmāt śukra prādurbhāvaḥ bhavati romarājī ādayaḥ ca viśeṣāḥ nārīṇām | 	Again it may be asked, how is it, that semen is not found in an infant? Since perfume in a flower-bud is imperceptible to the organ of smell you may as well ask whether there is any perfume in it or not. But what does not exist in a thing can not be evoked in the subsequent course of its development. As the perfume in a flower-bud lies latent in its early stage of growth but becomes patent only with the growth of its seed organs, so semen or catamenial blood lies in a potential state in a male or a female child, and appears with the growth of beards and mustaches, or with the enlargement of the breasts, uterus and vaginal canal and the appearance of pubic hair. 
saḥ eva anna rasaḥ vṛddhānām paripakva śarīra tvāt aprīṇanaḥ bhavati || 	The same Rasa, originated from the assimilated food, serves only to maintain the vitality in the old and spontaneously decayed subjects owing to an exhausted state of the inner vitalising principle, natural to old age. 
teṣām kṣaya vṛddhī śoṇita nimitte tasmāt tat adhikṛtya vakṣyāmaḥ | 	The abovesaid principles (of Rasa, blood etc.) are called the root principles (Dhatus), inasmuch as they maintain the integrity of the human organism and guard against its speedy dissolution)., And since the strength or weakness of the abovesaid bodily principles absolutely depends upon the richness or poverty of blood, we shall discourse on the latter condition of the blood. 
tatra phanilam aruṇam kṛṣṇam parūṣam tanu śīghra gama skandi ca vātena duṣṭam nīlam pītam haritam śyāvam visram aniṣṭam pipīlikā makṣikāṇām askandi ca pitta duṣṭam gairika udaka pratīkāśam snigdham śītalam bahalam picchilam cira srāvi māṃsa peśī prabham ca śleṣma duṣṭam sarva lakṣaṇa saṃyuktam kāñjika ābham viśeṣataḥ durgandhi ca saṃnipāta duṣṭam (? pitta vat raktena ati kṛṣṇam ca 	The blood, vitiated by the deranged bodily wind (Vayu), becomes thin, frothy, transparent, quick-coursing, and expansive, assumes a vermilion or black hue, and is divested of its slimy character; whereas vitiated through a deranged condition of the bile (Pitta), it assumes a blue, yellow, green, or brown colour, emits a fishy smell, becomes thin in its consistency and is shun by flies and ants. Similarly, blood, vitiated by the deranged phlegm (Kapha), becomes cold, glossy and thick, assumes a colour like that of the washings of Gairika or that of a flesh tendon, takes time in secreting or in running down, and is marked by an increase of its slimy character. 
indragopaka pratīkāśam asaṃhatam avivarṇam ca prakṛti stham jānīyāt || 	The blood in its healthy and natural state is possessed of a vivid red colour like that of an Indragopa (Cochineal) insect, and is neither too thin nor too transparent.[3] 
atha avisrāvyāḥ sarva aṅga śophaḥ kṣīṇasya ca amla bhojana nimittaḥ pāṇdurogī arśasā udari śoṣi garbhiṇīnām ca śvayathavaḥ || 	A person afflicted with an edematous swelling extending all over the body should be deemed unfit for bleeding. 
tatra śastra visrāvaṇam dvividham pracchānam sirāvyadhanam ca || 	Blood-letting, with the help of a surgical instrument, may be grouped under two distinct heads, according as scarification (Pracchana) or venesection (Sira-Vyadhana) is resorted to for the purpose. 
tatra ṛju asaṃkīrṇam sūkṣmam samam anavagāḍham anuttānam āśu ca śastram pātayet marma sirā snāyu sandhīnām ca anupaghāti || 	In such a case the knife or the instrument (Shastram) should be driven straight and speedily so as to make the incision straight, narrow, unextended, and of equal and slight depth throughout, (so as to reach only the surface layer of the flesh and blood), and not to injure in any way the local veins, nerves, joints, and other vital parts. 
tatra durvine durviddhe śīta vātayoḥ asvinne bhukta mātre skanda tvāt śoṇitam na sravati alpam vā sravati || 	Bleeding performed on a cloudy day or done with a wrong incision, or with full exposure to cold and wind, or performed on a patient not previously diaphorised, or on a patient with an empty stomach, is attended with little or no outflow of blood owing to the thickened condition of the blood.

A man possessed of such a body is capable of all kinds of work and movement. He can fairly stand the inclemencies of weather and the keenness of hunger and thirst, and will gain in strength and energy. 
atyanta garhitau etau sadā sthūla kṛśau narau | 	Excessively corpulent and excessively lean persons are alike condemnable.

The child should be placed on the lap of its nurse, and benedictions should be pronounced over it. Then having soothed it and lured it with toys and playthings, the physician should draw down with his left hand the lobules of its ears with a view to detect, with the help of the reflected sun-light, (the closed up) apertures that are naturally found to exist in those localities. 
śoṇita bahu tvena vedanayā ca anya deśa viddham iti jānīyāt nirupadrava tayā tad deśa viddham iti || 	A copious bleeding attended with pain would indicate that the needle has passed through a place other than the natural (and closed up) fissure described above; whereas the absence of any serious after-effect would give rise to the presumption that the piercing has been done through the right spot.

Then having ascertained the particular nature of adhesion to be effected in the case, the surgeon should examine the local blood by incising, excising, scarifying or puncturing the affected lobes as found necessary, and determine whether the same is pure or vitiated. Then having washed the blood with Dhanyamla and tepid water, if found vitiated through the action of the deranged (Vayu), or with milk and cold water in the event of the same being contaminated by the deranged Pitta, or with Suramanda and warm water in the case of its being vitiated by the action of the disordered Kapha, the surgeon shall bring about the adhesion by again scarifying the affected parts of the ear, so as not to leave the adhesioned parts elevated (raised), unequal and short.

bāhya chedam na kurvīta vyāpadaḥ syuḥ tatas dhruvāḥ || 	The lobe of an ear, which refuses to grow in size in spite of being fomented and lubricated as above indicated, should be scarified with slight longitudinal incisions on its anterior side (that is on the side nearest to the cheeks) and not on the posterior one, as such a procedure might be attended with dreadful results. 
baddha mātram tu yaḥ karṇam sahasā eva abhivardhayet | 	An ear-lobe should not be tried to be elongated just after the adhesion of its two severed parts, inasmuch as the centre of the adhesion, still being raw, might cause them to fall off again.

madhuka kṣīrakākolī jīvaka ādyaiḥ vipācitam | 	In a case of ulceration, the ulcerated ear-lobe should be rubbed with the oil prepared and boiled with the drugs known as Madhuka and Kshira-kakoli, or with those which form the group known as the Jivakadi-Varga; while in a case where Vringhana measures are to be adopted, lard prepared from the fat of a Godha, boar, or snake might be used with advantage.

dhārayati avirodhena śarīram pāñcabhautikam || 	It should never be applied (so as to run down with the local hair), since a plaster, applied as directed above, would firmly stick to the surface of the affected part, and naturally percolate through the follicles of the hair and the external orifices of the vehicles of perspiration (Sudoriferous ducts), thus permeating the organism with its own native potency and virtue.

A medicinal plaster of the Alepana class stands midway between a Pralepa and a Pradeha. 
tatra raktapitta prasāda kṛt ālepaḥ pradehaḥ vāta śleṣma praśamanaḥ saṃdhānaḥ śodhanaḥ ropaṇaḥ śopha vedanā apahaḥ ca tasya upayogaḥ kṣata akṣateṣu yaḥ tu kṣateṣu upayujyate sa bhūyas kalkaḥ iti saṃjñām labhate niruddālepana saṃjñaḥ tena āsrāva sat nirodhaḥ mṛdu tā pūti māṃsa apakarṣaṇam anantardoṣa tā vraṇa śuddhiḥ ca bhavati || 	Of these, a plaster of the Pralepana class is possessed of the efficacy of pacifying or restoring the deranged blood and Pitta to their normal condition. A plaster of the Pradeha class pacifies the deranged Vayu and Kapha and tends to bring about the union, purification, and healing (of an ulcer), causing the subsidence of pain and swelling. 
avidagdheṣu śopheṣu hitam ālepanam bhavet | 	Hence it should be used in all types of swelling whether ulcerated or otherwise. 
yathāsvam doṣa śamanam dāha kaṇḍū rujā apaham || 	A medicinal plaster of the Alepana class would prove beneficial in a swelling marked by the absence of suppuration, inasmuch as it subdues the characteristic symptoms of each of the deranged bodily humours viz, the burning sensation (peculiar to the deranged Pitta), itching (incidental to the deranged state of Kapha) and the aching pain (which marks the disorder of the bodily Vayu). 
tvac prasādanam eva agryam māṃsa rakta prasādanam | 	Its action lies principally in cleansing the skin, the flesh and the blood of all morbiferous diatheses, in removing the burning sensation, and in alleviating the piercing pain and itching. 
saṃśodhanāya teṣām hi kuryāt ālepanam bhiṣaj || 	A physician (surgeon) should use an Alepana in (ulcerous) diseases appearing about the anus, or about any other vital part (Marmas) of the body, with a view to bring about the purification of the (local deranged humours). 
aṣṭa bhāgam tu kapha je sneha mātrām pradāpayet || 	In diseases caused by a deranged condition of the Vayu, Pitta or Kapha, medicinal plasters should be respectively mixed with a quantity of clarified butter, measuring a sixth, quarter, and an eighth part of their respective quantities. 
na ca ālepam rātrau prayuñjīta mā bhūt śaiti apihita ūṣmaṇaḥ tad anirgamāt vikāra pravṛttiḥ iti || pradeha sādhye vyādhau tu hitam ālepanam divā | 	Under no condition, should a medicinal plaster be applied at night, inasmuch as such a measure would arrest the escape or radiation of heat from the swelling in virtue of its own inherent humidity, and thus bring on an aggravation. 
pitta rakta abhighāta utthe sa viṣe ca viśeṣataḥ || 	In diseases, which are amenable to the application of medicinal plasters of the Pradeha type, as well as in swellings resulting from the vitiated condition of blood and the Pitta, or in those which are of extrinsic origin, or are due to the effect of a poison or blow, the plaster should be applied cold, by day. 
upari upari lepam tu na kadācid pradāpayet || ūṣmāṇam vedanām dāham ghana tvāt janayet sa hi | 	A plaster should not be applied without removing the previous one, nor over the one applied on the day before, as this would increase the local heat and aggravate the pain and the burning sensation on account of its greater or increased thickness. 
na ca tena eva lepena pradeham dāpayet punar | 	A medicinal plaster, previously used, should not be moistened and applied again; it should be held as absolutely ineffective owing to its virtue having been previously used or soaked in.[2]

Similarly, the bandage, known as the Anuvellita, should be used when the seat of the affection would be found to be situated at the extremities (hands and legs). A bandage of the Protoli class should be tied round the neck or the penis; the Mandala (ring-shaped), round the circular parts of the body; the Sthagika (betel-box), round the glans-penis and the tips of the fingers; the Yamaka, round the confluent or contiguous ulcers; the Khatta (bedstead-shaped), over and around the cheeks, cheek-bones, and the parts between the ears and the eye-brows; the Vitana over the skull, the Gophana (horn-shaped), round the region of the chin; and the Pancangi, round the part lying above the clavicles. 
yantraṇam ūrdhvam adhiḥ tiryak ca || 	Now we shall deal with the Yantranas (fastenings of bandages) which admit of being divided into three different classes according as they are fastened above, below, or obliquely round an ulcer. 
tatra ghanām kavalikām dattvā vāma hasta parikṣepam ṛjum anāviddham asaṃkucitam mṛdu paṭṭam niveśya badhnīyāt | 	The tow or the Kavalika should be placed thickly (on the seat of affection); and then the physician (surgeon) having pressed it with his left hand should[4] place a piece of straight, soft, untwisted, and unfolded or unshrivelled linen over it, and then firmly tie up the bandage in a manner so as not to leave any knot over the seat of the ulcer, or to cause any discomfort to the patient. 
na ca vikeśika auṣadhe ati snigdhe ati rūkṣe viṣame vā kurvīta yasmāt ati snehāt kledaḥ raukṣyāt chedaḥ durnyāsa āhraṇa vartma avagharṣaṇam iti || 	Care should be taken not to introduce the lint extremely dry, or oily (oversoaked in a lubricating or oily medicinal preparation), inasmuch as an over-lubricated lint would give rise to an excessive formation of slimy mucus in the ulcer, whereas, its parched substitute would bring about the friction and the consequent breaking of the edges of the ulcer, like one misplaced or wrongly inserted. 
tatra vraṇa yatana viśeṣāt bandha viśeṣaḥ trividhaḥ bhavati gāḍhaḥ samaḥ śithilaḥ iti || 	A bandage should be tied in any of the three ways of Gadha, Sama and Shithila fastenings according to the shape and seat of the ulcer.[5] A tight bandage (Gadha-Vandha) should be tied round the buttocks, round the sides, round the arm-pits, round the inguinal regions, round the breast or round the head. 
tatra sphic kukṣi kakṣā vaṅkṣaṇa ūru śiraḥsu gāḍhaḥ śākhā vadana karṇa kaṇṭha meḍhra muṣka pṛṣṭha pārśva udara uraḥsu samaḥ akṣṇoḥ sandhiṣu ca śithila ti || 	A bandage of the Sama pattern should be fastened round the ears, round the extremities (hands and legs), round the face, round the throat, round the lips, round the penis, round the scrotum, round the back, round the belly and the chest.

tatra paittikam śaradi grīṣme dvis ahnaḥ badhnīyāt rakta upadrutam api evam ślaiṣmikam hemanta vasantayoḥ tri ahāt vāta upadrutam api evam | 	A tight bandage should give place to a lighter one under the same circumstances, and such a procedure should be deemed as holding good even in the case of an ulcer caused by the action of the deranged Vayu. In summer and autumn, the bandage of an ulcer, due to the vitiated blood or Pitta, should be changed twice a day; while the one tied round an ulcer of the deranged Vayu or Kapha, should be changed on each third day in spring and Hemanta. 
evam abhyūhya bandha viparyayam ca kuryāt || 	“Thou shalt exercise thy own discretion, and vary or adopt the preceding rules of bandaging according to the exigencies of each case.”

a badhyamānaḥ daṃśa maśaka tṛṇa kāṣṭha upala pāṃśu śītavāta ātapa prabhṛtibhiḥ viśeṣaiḥ abhihanyate vraṇaḥ vividha vedanā upadrutaḥ ca duṣṭa tām upaiti ālepana ādīni ca asya viśoṣam upayānti || 	It is moistened by sweat and cold wind, etc. and stands in danger of being irritated by deposits of many foreign matters such as, the particles of bone, dust, weeds, etc. Moreover, a constant exposure to heat or cold brings on varied pains, the ulcer develops into one of a malignant type, and the applied medicinal plasters are dried, encrusted and speedily fall off. 
cūrṇitam mathitam bhagnam viśliṣṭam atipātitam | asthi snāyu sirā chinnam āśu bandhena rohati || 	A smashed, lacerated, fractured, dislocated, displaced bone, or a vein or a ligament similarly jeopardised, may be soon healed or set right with the help of a surgical bandage.

karṇikāḥ ca unduru viṣe viṣa juṣṭa vraṇāḥ ca ye || 	The same rule should be observed in the case of a dreadful suppuration about the anus, or in that of a sloughing ulcer. 
deśam doṣam ca vijñāya vraṇam ca vraṇa kovidaḥ | 	An intelligent physician, familiar with the specific features of ulcers, should observe the shape of the one under treatment, and prognosticate the result from its seat or locality and the nature of the deranged bodily humours involved in the case. 
ūrdhvam tiryak adhastāt ca yantraṇā trividhā smṛtā | 	Bandages may be tied up either from above, below, or from the sides of a diseased locality. 
yathā ca badhyate bandhaḥ tathā vakṣyāmi aśeṣatas || ghanām kavalikām dattvā mṛdu ca eva api paṭṭakam 	Now I shall fully describe the process of bandaging an ulcer.[6] First the Kavalika or tow should be thickly laid over the seat of the ulcer and after that a piece of soft and unshrivelled linen should be placed upon it, and the bandage should be loosely or tightly tied up according to the directions laid down before.[6] 
vikeśikām auṣadham ca na ati snigdham samācaret || 	The lint and the (inserted) medicine should not be over-lubricated and must not be inordinately oily in as-much as such a lint or medicine would give rise to the formation of excessive and abnormal slimy mucous in the ulcer. 
prakledayati ati snigdhā tathā rūkṣā kṣiṇoti ca | 	On the other hand, an extremely dry lint would set up friction and laceration of the edges of the ulcer, like the one wrongly or improperly inserted into its cavity, causing numbness, excessive exudation and unevenness of its surface. 
yukta snehā ropayati durnyastā vartma gharṣati || 	A lint, properly saturated with a medicinal plaster and rightly inserted into the cavity of an ulcer, leads to its speedy healing. 
viṣamam ca vraṇam kuryāt stambhayet srāvayet tathā | 	All secreting measures in connection with an ulcer should be continued or stopped according to its condition, whereby the nature and shape of the bandage should be determined as well. 
pitta je rakta je vā api sakṛtā iva parikṣipet | 	An ulcer, due either to the deranged condition of blood or the Pitta, should be dressed and bandaged once a day which may be extended to a number of times in the case of an ulcer brought about by the deranged Kapha and Vayu. 
sarvān ca bandhān gūḍha antān sandhīn ca viniveśayet || 	The pus or the local morbid matter should be secreted by pressing the base or the bottom of an ulcer and by gently moving the hand along it in a contrary direction (down, upward; and all bandages around joints and Gudasandhis) should be duly tied up. 
oṣṭhasya api eṣa sandhāne yathā uddiṣṭaḥ vidhiḥ smṛtaḥ | 	The rules laid down under the head of adhesioning the parts of a bifurcated ear-lobe would hold good in a case of severed lips as well.

prācyām diśi sthitāḥ devāḥ tad pūjā artham ca tat śiraḥ || 	The reason for the head being turned towards the east is that the patient may easily make obeisance to the (demons and) celestial spirits, who inhabit that quarter of the sky.

divāsvapnāt draṇe kaṇḍūḥ gātrāṇām gauravam tathā | 	An ulcer-patient should not sleep in the day time, as it tends to aggravate the pain, swelling and redness of the ulcer, increases its exudations, and gives rise to itching and heaviness of the limbs.

Because the monsters and demons of mighty prowess, who are the attendants of the gods Pashupati, Kuvera and Kumara, roam about in quest of prey, and visit the bedside of an ulcer-patient out of their fondness for flesh and blood, being attracted thereto by the smell of the secreted and morbid matter in the ulcer. These evil spirits come to take away the life of a patient in a case which is doomed to terminate fatally, while in a successful case their advent is due to the desire of extorting sacrificial oblations from him.

te tu saṃtarpitāḥ ātmavantamk na hiṃsyuḥ | 	The evil spirits, worshipped and propitiated as above, spare the life of a self-controlled patient (out of compassion).

taṇḍulīyaka jīvantī suniṣaṇṇaka vāstukaiḥ bāla mūlaka vāta arka paṭolaiḥ kāravellakaiḥ || sa dāḍimaiḥ sa āmalakaiḥ ghṛta bhṛṣṭaiḥ sa saindhavaiḥ 	A diet consisting of boiled rice, the pot-herbs known as the Tanduliyaka, Jivanti, Sunishannaka, Vastuka, immature Mulaka, Vartaku, Patola and Karavella, fried with Saindhava (rock-salt) and clarified-butter, and seasoned with the expressed Juice of Dhadima and amalaka, or of Mudga soup treated as above, should be prescribed for the patient.

atha atas hitāhitīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which treats of the salutary and non-salutary effects of regimen, etc. (Hitahitiya-adhyaya). 
yat vāyoḥ pathyam tat pittasya apathyam iti anena hetunā na kiṃcid dravyam ekāntena hitam ahitam vā asti iti kecid ācāryāḥ bruvate | 	According to certain eminent medical authorities, an article or a substance which is beneficial in derangements of the bodily Vayu may prove positively injurious in a Pittaja affection; hence it is impossible to name an article or substance which is absolutely or universally wholesome (irrespective of the nature and type of a disease, and of the deranged bodily humours involved therein). 
tat tu na samyak 	But we cannot subscribe to the foregoing hypothesis, since by nature or combination, things (substances) are, or become endued with properties, which prove absolutely beneficial or unconditionally harmful or exert a mixed virtue (both beneficial and injurious) according to the difference in the natur and type of the disease in which they are employed.

tathā brahmacarya nivāta śayana uṣṇa udaka snāna niśā svapna vyāyāmāḥ ca ekāntataḥ pathyatamāḥ || 	Similarly, the practise of self-control, residence in a room protected from the strong gusts of wind, sleeping only at night, tepid water, and moderate physical exercise should be regarded as absolutely conducive to a better preservation of health. 
ekānta hitāni ekānta ahitāni ca prāk upadiṣṭāni hita ahitāni tu yat vāyoḥ pathyam tat pittasya apathyam iti || 	We have already enumerated the names of substances which are absolutely beneficial or unconditionally injurious to human health.

rogam sātmyam ca deśam ca kālam deham ca buddhimān | 	An intelligent physician, considering the nature of the disease, the strength and temperament of the patient, and the state of his digestion as well as the seat of the affection, the physical features of the country and the then prevailing season of the year, should prescribe a diet which he thinks the most proper and suitable to the requirements of the case. 
dravyam na icchanti bhiṣajaḥ icchanti svastha rakṣaṇe || 	Since the conditions infinitely vary in the different types of diseases and even the same conditions do not obtain in one and the same type,[1] physicians generally prescribe a diet of their own selection, one determined with regard to its general effect on health, in preference to one that has been laid down in books of medicine. 
dugdhasya ekānta hita tām viṣam ekāntataḥ ahitam || 	If asked to prescribe either milk or poison to a healthy person, a physician would naturally prescribe the former, and thereby, prove the absolute wholesomeness of milk and unconditional harmfulness of poison.

viruddhāni evamādīni vīryataḥ yāni kāni ca | 	Things or substances which are incompatible to one another in their respective tastes, potencies and reactionary transformation should be denied as absolutely unwholesome, while the rest should be considered as possessed of mixed virtues (wholesome or injurious under certain circumstances) as described before. 
vyādhim indriya daurbalyam maraṇam ca adhigacchati | viruddha rasa vīryāṇi bhuñjānaḥ anātmavān naraḥ || 	By taking substances which are incompatible to one another as regards their tastes, potencies and digestive transformation, a greedy and intemperate person becomes afflicted with disease and weakness of the sense-organs, and ultimately meets with his doom. 
yat kiṃcid doṣam utkleśya bhuktam kāyāt na nirharet | rasa ādiṣu ayathārtham vā tad vikārāya kalpate || viruddha aśana jān rogān pratihanti virecanam | 	Anything, which being taken enrages or agitates the bodily humours without causing the assimilated food (effete matter) to be evacuated out of the bowels, or is possessed of a taste contrary to, or other than what is necessary for the purposes of vitalization, should be looked upon as the primary source of all bodily distempers. 
vamanam śamanam vā api pūrvam vā hita sevanam || 	Diseases, brought about by a food or drink composed of incompatible substances, are amenable to the use of purgatives, emetics, or pacifying (corrective of the deranged humours) medicines; and such a diet, even when found unavoidable, should be preceded by the use of drugs or substances potent enough to neutralise its baneful effect.[2] 
sātymyataḥ alpa tayā vā api dīpta agneḥ taruṇasya ca | 	A meat, in the composition of which substances of incompatible virtues and potencies largely enter, fails to develop any distressing or harmful symptoms in subjects who are habitually addicted to it, or who takes it in small quantities, as well as in persons of youthful vigor and strong appetite, or in those who have become invigorated by the use of oily and albuminous food and healthful physical exercise.[3] 
atha vāta guṇān vakṣyāmaḥ 	Now we shall describe the effects of the winds on the body, (as they blow from the dfferent quarters of the heaven). 
pūrvaḥ sa madhuraḥ snigdhaḥ lavaṇaḥ ca eva mārutaḥ | 	The East wind, which is cool and sweet in its potency, is heavy and charged with salt; it aggravates blood and Pitta and gives rise to an acid digestive reaction. 
kṣatānām viṣa juṣṭānām vraṇinaḥ śleṣmalāḥ ca | 	It specially aggravates the disease in a patient suffering from a wound or an ulcer, or from the effect of any poison, and affects persons of Shleshmala temperament. 
vātalānām praśastaḥ ca śrāntānām kapha śoṣiṇām | 	It is highly efficacious to fatigued persons, as well as to those of a Vatala (nervous) temperament, or who are afflicted with any sort of Kaphaja disease; though it increases the slimy secretion in their ulcers if there be any. 
madhuraḥ ca avidāhī ca kaṣāya anurasaḥ laghuḥ | 	The South wind is light, sweet (produces the same soothing effect on the organism like a thing of sweet taste) and is followed by an astringent after-taste (Anurasa) being antacid in its reaction. 
dakṣiṇaḥ mārutaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ cakṣuṣyaḥ bala vardhanaḥ || rakta pitta praśamanaḥ na ca vāta prakopaṇaḥ 	It is the best of winds, gives vigour to the eyes, increases the strength, and soothes the blood and the Pitta without aggravating the bodily Vayu. 
paścimaḥ mārutaḥ tīkṣṇaḥ kapha medaḥ viśoṣaṇaḥ 	The West wind is pure, non-slimy, dry, rough to the perception, and keen. 
sadyas prāṇa kṣaya karaḥ śoṣaṇaḥ tu śarīriṇām || 	It absorbs or dries up fat and Kapha, produces a parched condition in the body when exposed to it, and speedily diminishes the strength of a person. 
uttaraḥ mārutaḥ snigdhaḥ mṛduḥ madhuraḥ eva ca | 	The North wind is cold, crisp, mild, of a sweet taste terminating in an astringent one. 
kaṣāya anurasaḥ śītaḥ doṣāṇām ca aprakopaṇaḥ || 	It does not in any way enrage or agitate the deranged bodily humours. 
tasmāt ca prakṛti sthānām kledanaḥ bala vardhanaḥ | 	In healthy subjects it increases the strength and the running secretions from the different orfices of the body (such as the nostrils etc.). 
kṣīṇa kṣaya viṣa ārtānām viśeṣeṇa tu pūjitaḥ || 	It proves extremely salutary to patients suffering from consumption, cachexia and the effects of poison. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne hitāhitīyaḥ nāma viṃśaḥ adhyāyaḥ || ekaviṃśatitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the twentieth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta samhita which treats of salutary and nonsalutary effects of the regimen. 
atha atas vraṇapraśnam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discuss the Chapter which investigates the nature of bodily humours, as exciting causes of ulcers (Vrana-prashna-adhyaya). 
vāta pitta śleṣmāṇaḥ eva deha saṃbhava hetavaḥ | 	The Vayu, Pitta and Shleshma should be considered as the primary and the most essential factors in the constitution of human organism. 
taiḥ eva avyāpannaiḥ adhas madhya ūrdhva sanniviṣṭaiḥ śarīram idam dhāryate agāram iva sthūṇābhiḥ tisṛbhiḥ atas ca tri sthūṇam āhuḥ eke | 	These fundamental and vital humours, occupying respectively the lower, middle, and upper parts of the body, maintain its integrity. The human body is supported by the three fundamental humours in the same way as a dwelling house is propped up by three supporting poles or stays; from which fact, the body is called the three-supported one (Tristhuna) by certain authorities. 
tat ebhiḥ eva śoṇita caturthaiḥ saṃbhava sthiti pralayeṣu api avirahitam śarīram bhavati || 	These three humours, in combination with a fourth, the principle of blood, determine the origin, preservation, and dissolution of animated organism and permeate it with their respective properties till the moment of death. 
na ṛte dehāḥ kaphāt asti na pittāt na ca mārutāt | śoṇitāt api vā nityam dehaḥ etaiḥ tu dhāryate || 	There can be no organism without Vayu, Pitta, Kapha and blood, which are necessary to constantly maintain its integrity. 
tatra vā gati gandhanayoḥ iti dhātuḥ tapa saṃtāpe śliṣaḥ āliṅgane eteṣām kṛt vihitaiḥ pratyayaiḥ vātaḥ pittam śleṣma iti ca rūpāṇi bhavanti || 	The terms Vata (Vayu), Pitta and Shleshma (Kapha) are respectively derived from the roots ‘Va’, to move or smell, ‘Tapa,’ to burn or to heat, and “Shlisha,” to embrace, with the suffix ‘Ta’ thereto added.[1] 
doṣa sthānāni atas ūrdhvam vakṣyāmaḥ tatra samāsena vātaḥ śroṇi guda saṃśrayaḥ tad upari adhas nābheḥ pakvāśayaḥ pakvāmāśaya madhyam pittasya āmāśayaḥ śleṣmaṇaḥ || 	Now we shall describe the locations of the foregoing vital humours. The Vayu may be briefly described as located in the regions of the pelvis (Shroni), and the rectum (Guda). The Pitta has its seat in the region between the stomach (amashaya) and the intestines (Pakvashaya) which is above the pelvis and the rectum and below the umbilicus, while the Kapha is ensconced within the cavity of the stomach (amashaya).

visarga ādāna vikṣepaiḥ soma sūrya anilāḥ yathā | 	The vital humours (Vayu, Pitta and Kapha) maintain the integrity of the animated organism by creating, assimilating and diffusing strength in the same way as the moon, the sun, and the winds maintain the integrity of the terrestrial globe.[2] 
tatra jijñāsyam kim pitta vyatirekāt anyaḥ agniḥ āhosvit pittam eva agniḥ iti | 	Now it may be asked whether the Pitta is identical with the elemental fire, or is it something other than that? The question may be answered by stating that the Pitta is the same as fire.

Even thus located, it keeps up the temperature in its other distant locations (skin, etc.) in virtue of its native heat-giving attribute. Hence this Pitta is called the Pachakagni (digestive fire or heat) in an animated organism. 
yat tu tvaci pittam tasmin bhrājakaḥ agniḥ iti saṃjñā saḥ abhyaṅga pariṣeka avagāha avalepana ādīnām kriyā dravyāṇām paktā chāyānām ca prakāśakaḥ || 	The Pitta, which has its seat in the skin, is called the Bhrajakagni (illuminating or irradiating heat) inasmuch as it absorbs the substances used in the shape of unguents, lubrications, etc. 
pittam tīkṣṇam dravam pūti nīlam pītam tathā eva ca | 	The Pitta is a keen, sharp and warm liquid, of a blue colour (in its normal state), or yellowish (in its deranged condition). 
uṣṇam kaṭu rasam ca eva vidagdham ca amlam eva ca || 	It emits a kind of fleshy smell and is possessed of a pungent taste which is transformed into an acid one when deranged or vitiated. 
atas ūrdhvam śleṣma sthānāni anuvyākhyāsyāmaḥ | 	Now we shall describe the locations of Kapha.

And since the stomach (amashaya) is situated above the pancreas (Pittashaya), and is endowed with a property (cooling) contrary to the primary virtue (heating) of Pitta, and, since the heat emitted by the receptacle of Pitta is naturally radiated in an upward direction, the four kinds of food, brought in to the stomach (Amashaya), are boiled and transformed into a soft placid mass (chyme), like rice boiled in a bowl full of water placed over a burning oven. The food, thus brought down into the stomach, is easily moistened, disintegrated and digested by coming into contact with the oily secretions of the stomach (amashaya). 
āmāśaye saṃbhavati śleṣmā madhura śītalaḥ || 	The Kapha is originated through the sweet, slimy, watery, exudating character of the food brought into the stomach (amashaya); and hence the Kapha becomes endued with similar attributes.

The Kapha, situated in the throat and at the root of the palate, lends its aid to the perception of tastes by maintaining the moist or humid character of the tongue. The Kapha, situated in the head, cools and bathes the different sense organs with its own humid essence, in virtue of its natural humid attributes.

śoṇitam guru visram syāt vidāhaḥ ca asya pitta vat || 	It is heavy, and it emits a fleshy smell and resembles the Pitta in its reactionary process, or in other words, those factors, which derange the Pitta, vitiate the blood as well.

It is aggravated by the use of sesamum oil, or of sesamum paste. Kulattha, Sarshapa, atashi, the pot-herbs known as Haritaka, fish, the flesh of a Godha or a goat or mutton may lead to its aggravation, if taken injudiciously.

sa śītaiḥ śīta kāle ca vasante ca viśeṣataḥ | 	The Kapha is naturally and spontaneously aggravated in the morning and evening, in Hemanta, and specially in Spring, and just after a meal.

Sleep in the day time, anger, exposure to the glare of the sun or fire, over-fatiguing labour, an external blow, ingestion of indigestible or incompatible substances, and eating before the full digestion of a previous meal, may as well be set down as causes which tend to aggravate blood. 
yasmāt raktmam vinā doṣaiḥ nā kadācid prakupyati | 	As the bodily humours are never aggravated independently of the blood, their aggravation goes together with a disturbed or agitated condition of the blood. 
teṣām prakopāt koṣṭha toda saṃcaraṇa amlikā pipāsā paridāha anna dveṣa hṛdaya utkledāḥ ca jāyante | 	The aggravated condition of the humours gives rise to pain and moves the wind Vayu) in the bowels; it further occasions acid eructations, thirst, burning sensations, aversion to food, vomiting and nausea.

teṣām vāyuḥ gatimat tvāt prasaraṇa hetuḥ sati api acaitanye | 	The Vayu, which is possessed of locomotion or extreme mobility, should be looked upon as the cause of their expansion or over-flowing. 
sa hi rajaḥ bhūyiṣṭhaḥ rajaḥ ca pravartakam sarva bhāvānām | 	The Vayu, though an inanimate thing, in reality is possessed of the quality of “Rajas” (creative or cohesive energy), and the quality of the Rajas is the only essential or motive principle in the universe.

kṛtsne ardhe avayave vā api yatra aṅge kupitaḥ bhṛśam | doṣaḥ vikāram nabhasi megha vat tatra varṣati || 	The aggravated, or the abnormally irritated deranged humours, whether permeating the whole or half of the system or restricted to any particular part or member of the body, give rise to disease in the place of their incarceration, like rain clouds pouring down in the quarter of the sky where they are formed. 
na atyartham kupitaḥ ca api līnaḥ mārgeṣu tiṣṭhati | 	The deranged humours, not excessively (slightly) aggravated, lie inoperative coating the internal passages (Margas) of the body and thus bring about a fresh disease, if subsequently agitated by any disturbing causes. 
tatra vāyoḥ pitta sthāna gatasya pittavat pratīkāraḥ pittasya ca kapha sthāna gatasya kaphavat kaphasya ca vāta sthāna gatasya vāta vat eṣa kriyā vibhāgaḥ || 	The deranged and aggravated Vayu, having moved into any specific seat of Pitta, should be medicinally treated as a case of Pittaja aggravation. Similarly, the deranged and aggravated Pitta, or Kapha, changing their respective places with each other, should be medicinally treated as the humour in whose location it is found.

evam prakupitāḥ tān tān śarīra pradeśān āgamya tān tān vyādhīn janayanti | 	Similarly, lodged in the region of the anus, these deranged and expanded humours beget fistula in ano, Hemorrhoids and polypus growths about that locality.

teṣām evam abhiniviṣṭānām pūrvarūpa prādurbhāvaḥ tam pratirogam vakṣyāmaḥ | 	The aggravated and expanded humours, thus firmly ensconced in the different parts of the body, exhibit the premonitory symptoms of diseases which will be fully dealt with under their respective heads. 
tatra pūrvarūpa gateṣu caturthaḥ kriyā kālaḥ || 	The manifestation of these premonitory symptoms should be considered as the fourth occasion for medical treatment.

saṃcayam ca prakopam ca prasaram sthāna saṃśrayam | vyaktim bhedam ca yaḥ vetti doṣāṇām sa bhavet bhiṣaj || 	The physician, who fully knows about the accumulation (Sancaya), disturbance or aggravation (Prakopa), expansion (Prasara), and differentiating traits of the deranged humours (Bheda), and is well conversant with the specific localities in which they are respectively confined in the course of their expansion (Sthana-samshrayam), and with the symptoms which they respectively exhibit in connection with the incidental disease (Vyakti), is alone worthy of that epithet. 
saṃcaye apahṛtāḥ doṣāḥ labhante na uttarāḥ gatīḥ | 	The deranged humours, checked or subdued in their accumulating stage, fail to exhibit any further or subsequent development, but, if left unremedied, they gain in strength and intensity in the course of their further development. 
sarvaiḥ bhāvaiḥ tribhiḥ vā api dvābhyām ekena vā punar | 	The humours, deranged either singly, or in couples, or in a triple combination as regards one or two of their virtues, push on, follow and blend with humours similarly deranged as regards their qualities and combinative numbers. 
śeṣa doṣa avirodhena sannipāte tathā eva ca || 	The medical treatment in a case, where two or all (three) of the deranged humours are involved, consists in conquering the strongest one in the combination, but so as not to enrage or aggravate the minor or the weaker humours in the group and specially so in a case of Sannipata.24 
tatra āyataḥ catur asraḥ vṛttaḥ tripuṭakaḥ iti vraṇa ākṛti samāsaḥ śeṣāḥ tu vikṛta ākṛtayaḥ durupakramāḥ bhavanti || 	A concourse of deranged humours, affecting and appearing in a particular part of the body, is called a boil or an ulcer (Vrana) which is derived from the root “Vri” to cover and is so called from the fact of its covering a particular part of the body or from its leaving a cicatrix which remains the whole life-time of the patient. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne kṛtyākṛtyavidhiḥ nāma trayoviṃśaḥ adhyāyaḥ || 	Thus ends the twenty-first chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of investigation into the nature ot the humours giving rise to an ulcer. 
atha atas vyādhisamuddeśīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter, which deals with the classification of diseases according to their specific nature (Vyadhi-Samuddheshiya-adhyaya). 
dvividhāḥ tu vyādhayaḥ śastra sādhyāḥ sneha ādi kriyā sādhyāḥ ca | 	Diseases may be grouped under two broad subdivisions, such as Surgical, and Medical, that is those that yield to the administration of purgatives, emetics, oils, diaphoretics, and unguents. 
tatra śastra sādhyeṣu sneha ādi kriyā na pratiṣidhyate sneha ādi kriyā sādhyeṣu śastra karma na kriyate || 	The use or administration of medicated oils and unguents, etc., is not prohibited in a surgical disease, while a case, which is exclusively medicinal in its character, does not admit of the adoption of any surgical remedy. 
asmin punar śāstre sarva tantra sāmānyāt sarveṣām vyādhīnām yathāsthūlam avarodhaḥ kriyate | 	Only a general outline of the nature and symptoms of all diseases will be found to have been briefly laid down in the present work. 
prak abhihitam tad duḥkha saṃyogāḥ vyādhayaḥ iti | 	It has been stated before that anything that afflicts either the body or the living personality—self, or both, is called disease. 
tat ca duḥkham trividham ādhyātmikam ādhibhautikam ādhidaivikam iti | 	This pain or affliction may be either physical[1] in its character (Adhyat-mika), or due to any disturbance in the physical environments of a man (adhibhautika), or to the acts of God (adhidaivika) etc. 
tat tu saptavidhe vyādhau upanipati | 	This three-fold pain may be ultimately transformed into any of the seven kinds of diseases such as, the adi-vala-pravritta, Janma-vala-pravritta, Dosha-vala-pravritta, Sanghata-vala-pravritta, Kala-vala-pravritta, Daiva-vala-pravritta and Svabhava-vala-pravritta. 
tatra ādi bala pravṛttāḥ ye śukra śoṇita doṣa anvayāḥ kuṣṭha arśaḥ prabhṛtayaḥ te api dvividhāḥ mātṛ jāḥ pitṛ jāḥ ca | 	The disease termed Adi-vala-pravritta is ascribed to any inherent defect in the semen or the ovum of one’s parent, which forms one of the original and primary factors of “being” and includes leprosy (Kushtha), hemorrhoids, phthisis etc. This type may be divided into two sub divisions, according as the disease is generated by the deranged paternal or maternal factor at the time of incubation. 
janma bala pravṛttāḥ ye mātuḥ apacārāt paṅgu jāti andha badhira mūka minmina vāmana prabhṛtayaḥ jāyante te api dvividhāḥ rasa kṛtāḥ dauhṛda apacāra kṛtāḥ ca | 	The Congenital or the Janma-vala-pravritta type usually follows such causes as an improper conduct on the part of the mother during the period of gestation, etc., and embraces such defects or maladies as (congenital) blindness, deafness, dumbness, nasal-voice, and such monstrous aberrations of nature as congenital cretinism, and the births of dwarfs and pigmies. This type, in its turn, admits of two sub-divisions, according as the disease is due to the action of the deranged lymph-chyle (Rasa-krita), or to an ungratified desire of the mother during gestation, or to her gratification of any improper longing or conduct during pregnancy (Dauhridyam). 
doṣa bala pravṛttāḥ ye ātaṅka samutpannāḥ mithyā āhāra ācāra kṛtāḥ ca te api dvividhāḥ āmāśaya samutthāḥ pakvāśaya samutthāḥ ca | 	The Dosha-vala-pravritta (idiopathic) type is due to the action of any of the fundamental bodily humours deranged by an improper diet, or resulting from the dynamical energies of the mind, such as (Rajas and Tamas, etc). 
punar ca dvividhāḥ śārīrāḥ mānasāḥ ca | 	This type may be classified under two sub-heads, according as the disease is found to have its origin in the amashaya (stomach), or in the Pakvashaya (intestines), and each of these again may be further divided into two main sub-divisions such as the physical and the mental. 
te ete ādhyātmikāḥ || 	The three preceding kinds of diseases include within their category disorders which are called mental or psychical (Adhyatmika). 
saṃghāta bala pravṛttāḥ ye āgantavaḥ durbalasya balavat vigrahāt te api dvividhāḥ śastra kṛtāḥ vyāla kṛtāḥ ca | 	The Traumatic type (Samghatha-vala-pravritta) includes diseases that are caused by an external blow or are due to wrestling with an antagonist of superior strength. 
ete ādhibhautikāḥ || 	These types belong to the adhi-bhautika type, i.e. 
kāla bala pravṛttāḥ ye śīta uṣṇa vāta varṣā prabhṛti nimittāḥ te api dvividhāḥ vyāpanna ṛtu kṛtāḥ avyāpanna ṛtu kṛtāḥ ca | 	(brought about by physical causes). The Periodical type (Kala-vala-pravritta) includes diseases that are brought about by the variation of atmospheric heat or humidity with the change of the seasons, and admits of being grouped under two different sub-heads, according as the seasons, which usher these changes in, exhibit natural or contrary features. 
daiva bala pravṛttāḥ ye deva drohāt abhiśastakāḥ atharvaṇa kṛtāḥ upasarga jāḥ ca te api dvividhāḥ vidyut aśani krtāḥ piśāca ādi kṛtāḥ ca punar ca dvividhāḥ saṃsarga jāḥ ākasmikāḥ ca | 	The Providential (Daiva-vala-pravritta) type includes diseases that are the embodiments of curses, divine wrath or displeasure, or are brought about through the mystic potencies of charms and spells, as described in the Atharva-Veda. This type may be divided into two minor divisions according as the disease is due to such acts of God as when a man is struck by lightning, etc., or to the malignant influences of demons and monsters, and these may be further grouped under two main sub-heads, according as the disease assumes a contagious character (epidemic), or is purely accidental, and restricts itself to isolated cases (sporadic). 
svabhāva bala pravṛttāḥ kṣudh pipāsā jarā mṛtyu nidrā prabhṛtayaḥ te api dvividhāḥ kāla kṛtāḥ akāla kṛtāḥ ca tatra parirakṣaṇa kṛtāḥ kāla kṛtāḥ aparirakṣaṇa kṛtāḥ akāla kṛtāḥ | 	The Natural or the Spontaneous (Svabhava-vala-pravritta) type includes such natural organic phenomena as, decrepitude, death,[2] hunger, thirst, sleep, etc. 
ete ādhidaivikāḥ | 	These diseases belong to the Providential or Adhi-daivika type[3]. 
atra sarva vyādhi avarodhaḥ || 	Thus we have classified diseases into their several types. 
sarveṣām ca vyādhīnām vāta pitta śleṣmāṇaḥ eva mūlam tad liṅga tvāt dṛṣṭa phala tvāt āgamāt ca | 	The deranged bodily humours such as, Vayu, Pitta and Kapha should be looked upon as the primary sources of all diseases, inasmuch as symptoms characteristic of each of them may be detected in the case of a disease of whatsoever type, (which usually abates with their corresponding subsidence), and also because the Shastras have ascribed to them the fatherhood of all maladies that assail the human frame. 
yathā hi kṛtsnam vikāra jātam viśva rūpeṇa avasthitam sattva rajaḥ tamāṃsi na vyatiricyante evam eva kṛtsnam vikāra jātam viśva rūpeṇa avasthitam a vyatiricya vāta pitta śleṣmāṇaḥ vartante | 	As the three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas[4] are inherent in, and inseparable from, all the phenomenal appearances in the universe which are, in reality, but modifications of their own qualities, so the three fundamental bodily humours underlie at the root of, and run through, the course of all known forms of bodily distemper. 
doṣa dhātu mala saṃsargāt āyatana viśeṣāt nimittataḥ ca eṣām vikalpaḥ | 	The deranged bodily humours (Dosha) in contact with the different elements, (Dhathu) and excrements (Mala) of the body, together with the difference of their locations and pathological effects, give rise to the different forms of disease.[5] 
doṣa dūṣiteṣu atyartham dhātuṣu saṃjñā kriyate rasa jaḥ ayam śoṇita jaḥ ayam māṃsa jaḥ ayam medaḥ jaḥ ayam asthi jaḥ ayam majja jaḥ ayam śukra jaḥ ayam vyādhiḥ iti || 	The nomenclature of a disease depends upon where the affection of the several elementary principles of the bod y by the deranged bodily humours lies, and which is accordingly styled as it is seated in the lymph-chyle, or in the blood or the flesh, or it is in fat, bone, or in the semen.

Maladies such as Kushtha (cutaneous affections in general), Visarpa (erysipelas), Pidaka (pustular eruptions), Mashaka, Nilika, Tilakalaka (specks), Nachya (tans), Vyanga (stains), Indralupta (alopecia), enlarged-spleen, Vidradhi (abscess), Gulma (abdominal glands), Vata-shonita (a kind of leprosy), Arsha (piles), Arvuda (tumours), aching of the limbs, menorrhagia, hemoptysis, etc.

Madhu-meha (diabetes), obesity and abnormal diaphoresis, etc. should be regarded as having their origin in the humour-deranged fat of the body. 
kupitānām hi doṣāṇām śarīre paridhāvatām | 	are the diseases which should be regarded as the outcome of the deranged bodily humours affecting the bones. 
yatra saṅgaḥ kha vaiguṇyāt vyādhiḥ tatra upajāyate || 	The deranged and aggravated humours, freely coursing through the body, give rise to a disease at the place in which they are incarcerated owing to an obstruction in their natural passage.

bhavati ca atra | 	as they are found to be in reality. 
vikāra parimāṇam ca saṃkhyā ca eṣām pṛthak pṛthak | 	We shall describe the nature, intensity and quality of diseases with their complications and give the number of their different types. 
vistareṇa uttare tantre sarva ābādhāḥ ca vakṣyate || 	Diseases [omitted to be mentioned in the chapter on Nidana (etiology)] will be found fully dealt with in the supplementary part of the present work (Uttara-tantra).

atha atas aṣṭavidhaśastrakarmīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāstāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter which deals with the eight different forms of surgical operations (Ashtavidha-ShastraKarmanya-adhyaya).

trayaḥ trayaḥ ca upadaṃśāḥ stana rogāḥ vidārikā || 	The process known as Aharana (extraction or drawing out) should be adopted in the three types of Sharkara,[2] in drawing out any morbid matter from between the teeth or from the cavity of the ears, or in extracting any foreign matter from its seat of lodgment in the body, or a stone from the bladder, or in drawing out feces from the constricted anus, or a fetus from the uterus, (as in the case of a false presentation or difficult labour).

na antar lohita śalyāḥ ca teṣu samyak viśodhanam | 	An ulcer incidental to the application of fire (cautery), or any alkaline preparation (caustic), or treated with any poisonous drug or substance, or from whose inside the embedded Shalya (foreign matter) has not been removed, should not be sewed up without being thoroughly cleansed and purified (asepsised) inasmuch as any foreign matter, whether a hair, nail or a particle of dust or bone, lying embedded in its cavity, might set up an abnormal suppuration, accompanied by extreme pain and excessive secretion. 
rujaḥ ca vividhāḥ kuryuḥ tasmāt etān viśodhayet || 	Hence such ulcers should be thoroughly cleansed (and all foreign or indigenous morbid matter should be extracted therefrom) before being sewed up. 
tatas vraṇam samunnamya sthāpayitvā yathāsthitam | 	Then having pressed the ulcer up into its proper position, it should be sutured with strings of any of the following kinds, viz. 
sīvyet sūkṣmeṇa sūtreṇa valkena aśmantakasya vā || 	of thin cotton thread, of the fibres of the Ashmantaka tree or hemp plants, or of the Atasi, Murva or Guduci, or with strips of leather, plaited horsehair or animal sinews, into any of the officinal shapes (of suturing) known as the Gophana, Tunna-Sevani and Riju-Granthi, etc. 
śaṇa ja kṣauma sūtrābhyām snāyvā bālena vā punar | 	or as suited to the shape and position of the ulcerated part. 
mūrvā guḍūcī tānaiḥ vā sīvyet vellitakam śanais || 	The margin of the ulcer should be gently pressed close with the fingers during suturing. 
ṛju granthim atho vā api yathāyogam atha api vā || deśe alpa māṃse sandhau ca sūcī vṛttā aṅgula dvayam | 	A round needle to the length of two fingers’ width should be used in sewing up an ulcer occurring about any joint or in a part of the body where the flesh is thin and scanty. 
āyatā tri aṅgulā tri asrā māṃsale vā api pūjitā || 	A needle of a triangular body (tri-hedral), and measuring three fingers’ width in length, is recommended in the case of an ulcer appearing at any fleshy part of the body. 
dhanus vakrā hitā marma phala kośa udara upari iti etāḥ trividhāḥ sūcīḥ tīkṣṇa agrāḥ su samāhitāḥ || kārayet mālatī puṣpa vṛnta agra parimaṇḍalāḥ 	Needles of these three shapes should be so constructed as to be fitted with sharp points capable of being handled with the greatest ease, having a girth equal that of the stem of a Malati flower. 
na ati dūre nikṛṣṭe vā sūcīm karmaṇi pātayet || dūrāt rujaḥ vraṇa oṣṭhasya sannikṛṣṭe avaluñcanam || 	The needle should not be pricked into a part too near, or too remote from the fissure, or the mouth of an ulcer, as there might be the danger of the suture being broken off (at the least pressure or movement) in the first instance and of genesis of pain in the second. 
priyaṅgu añjana yaṣṭyāhva rodhra cūrnaiḥ samantataḥ || śallakī phala cūrnṇaiḥ vā kṣauma dhyāmena vā punar | 	An ulcer, thus properly sutured, should be covered over with cotton and dusted over with a pulverised compound consisting of the powders of Priyangu, Anjana, Yasthyahva and Rodhra, or with the ashes of a burnt piece of Kshauma cloth, or with the powders of the Shallaki fruit. 
tatas vraṇam yathāyogam baddhvā ācārikam ādiśet || 	Then the ulcer should be properly bandaged, and measures and rules regarding the regimen of diet, and conduct previously laid down in the chapter on the nursing of an ulcer-patient (Ch. 
etat aṣṭavidham karma samāsena prakīrtitam | 	The eight kinds of surgical operations have thus been briefly described. 
cikitsiteṣu kārtsnyena vistaraḥ tasya vakṣyate || 	They will be dealt with later on in the Chikitsita. 
etāḥ catasraḥ aṣṭavidhe karmaṇi vyāpadaḥ smṛtāḥ | 	These eight forms of operations may be attended with dangers of four different kinds such as those arising from an insufficient or over performance, or from the slanting or oblique deviation (of the knife or the instrument), or from an act of self-injury on the part of the physician. 
ajñāna lobha ahita vākya yoga bhaya pramohaiḥ aparaiḥ ca bhāvaiḥ | yadā prayuñjīta bhiṣaj kuśastram tadā sa śeṣān kurute vikārān || 	A physician (surgeon) making a wrong operation on the body of his patient either through mistake, or through the want of necessary skill or knowledge, or out of greed, fear, nervousness or haste, or in consequence of being spurned or abused, should be condemned as the direct cause of many new and unforeseen maladies. 
jijīviṣuḥ dūratas eva vaidyam vivarjayet ugra viṣa ahi tulyam || 	A patient, with any instinct of self-preservation, would do well to keep aloof from such a physician, or from one who makes a wrong or injudicious application of the cautery, and should shun his presence just as he would shun a conflagration or a cup of fatal poison. 
mūrkha prayuktam puruṣam kṣaṇena prāṇaiḥ viyuñjyāt athavā kathaṃcid || 	On the other hand, a surgical operation, carried to excess, (or a surgical instrument inserted deeper than what is necessary, is attended with the danger of cutting or destroying a vein, ligament, bone, joint, or any vital part of the body.[3] A surgical operation by an ignorant surgeon brings about, in most cases, the instantaneous death of the patient, or consigns him to the pangs of a life-long death. 
bhramaḥ pralāpaḥ patanam pramohaḥ viceṣṭanam saṃlayana uṣṇa te ca | 	The symptoms which generally manifest themselves in connection with the injudicious hurting of any of the five vital parts or principles of the body (such as the joints, bones, veins, ligaments, etc.) are vertigo, delirium, loss of bodily functions, semi-insensibility (comatose state), incapacity of supporting oneself, cessation of mental functions, heat, fainting, looseness of the limbs, difficult respiration, excruciating pain or pain peculiar to the deranged Vayu, secretion of blood or a thin watery secretion like the washings of meat from the injured part, or the organ, with coma or inoperativeness of all the senses. 
srasta aṅga tā mūrchanam ūrdhvavātaḥ tīvrāḥ rujaḥ vāta kṛtāḥ ca tāḥ tāḥ || 	A vein* (Shira) any way severed or injured is attended with a copious flow (hemorrhage) of deep red blood, resembling the hue of the cochineal insect, from the ulcer; and the deranged local Vayu readily exhibits all its essential characteristics, and ushers in diseases which have been enumerated under that head in the chapter on the description of blood.) 
karoti rogān vividhān yathā uktān chinnāsu bhinnāsu athavā sirāsu || 	Similarly, an injured ligament gives rise to a crookedness or bending of, as well as to a gone feeling in the injured limb or organ, attended with pain and loss of function, and the incidental ulcer takes a long time to heal. 
śopha ativṛddhiḥ tumulā rujaḥ ca bala kṣayaḥ parvasu bheda śophau | 	An abnormal increase in the local swelling, together with an excruciating pain, loss of strength, breaking pain in the joints, and in-operativeness of the affected part, mark the wounding of a flexible or immovable joint. 
ghorāḥ rujaḥ yasya niśā dineṣu sarvāsu avasthāsu na śāntiḥ asti | 	Similarly, in the case where a bone is hurt or injured in the course of a surgical operation, the patient is tormented with indescribable pain, day and night, and finds no comfort in any position whatsoever. 
tṛṣṇā aṅga sādau śvayathuḥ ca rukṣaḥ tam asthi viddham manujam vyavasyet || 	Pain and swelling specifically mark the affected locality, and thirst and inertness of the limbs add to the list of his sufferings. 
yathāsvam etāni vibhāvayeyuḥ liṅgāni marmasu abhitāḍiteṣu | 	A case of any injured Sira-Marma (vital venal or arterial combination or plexus) exhibits the same symptoms which characterise the hurting of a single vein, as previously described. 
sparśam na jānāti vipāṇḍu varṇaḥ yaḥ māṃsa marmaṇi abhitāḍitaḥ syāt || 	Loss of actual perception (anesthesia), and a yellowish colour of the skin mark the case where the injury is confined to the vital principle of the flesh. 
ātmānam eva atha jaghanya kārī śastreṇa yaḥ hanti hi karma kurvan | 	A patient, who is discreet, and is not in a special hurry to end his earthly sojourn, would do well to shun the presence of a bungling, unskilful surgeon, who can not even keep himself unhurt in the course of a surgical operation. 
tiryak praṇihite śastre doṣāḥ purvam udāhṛtāḥ | 	The evils, which attend the oblique insertion of a surgical instrument, have been described before; and accordingly care should be taken not to leave any room for the occurence of those evils in connection with a surgical operation. 
tasmāt putra vat eva enam pālayet āturam bhiṣaj || 	The patient, who may mistrust his own parents, sons and relations, should repose an implicit faith in his own physician, and put his own life into his hands without the least apprehension of danger; hence a physician should protect his patient as his own begotten child. 
karmaṇā kaścid ekena dvābhyām kaścid tribhiḥ tathā | 	A surgical case may yield to a single incision, or may require two, three, four or more than that number to effect a cure. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne aṣṭavidhaśastrakarmaṇyaḥ nāma pañcaviṃśaḥ adhyāyaḥ || ṣaḍviṃśatitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the twenty-fifth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of the eight forms of Surgical operations. 
atha atas pranaṣṭaśalyavijñānīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter which treats of the exploration of splinters lost or deep-seated in the organism (Pranashta-Shalya-Vijnaniya-adhyaya). 
śala śvala āśu gamane dhatuḥ tasya śalyam iti rūpam || tat dvividham śārīaram āgantukam ca || 	The term Shalya is derived from the root “Shala” or “Shvala” (to go swiftly) joined to the Unadi affix “Yat.” Shalyas may be divided into two kinds according as they are extrinsic "(Agantuka) or idiopathic (Sharira) in their origin. 
sarva śarīra ābādha karam śalyam tat iha upadiśyate iti atas śalya śāstram || 	A Shalya usually serves to act as an impeding or obstructing agent to the entire organism, and, hence, the science which deals with its nature and characteristics is called the Shalya-Shastram (Surgery). 
tatra śārīram roma nakha ādi dhātavaḥ anna malāḥ doṣāḥ ca duṣṭāḥ āgantu api śārīra śalya vyatirekeṇa yāvantaḥ bhāvāḥ duḥkham utpādayanti || 	An idiopathic (Sharira) Shalya may be either a hair, nail, embolised blood (Dhatus)[1], etc., excrements (Mala), or deranged humours of the body (Dosha), while an extrinsic Shatyam should be regarded as one which afflicts the body and is originated from a source other than any of the preceding ones, including particles of iron and bone, stems of grass, scrapings of bamboo, and bits of horns, etc. 
adhikāraḥ hi loha veṇu vṛkṣa tṛṇa śṛṅga asthi mayeṣu tatra api viśeṣataḥ loheṣu eva viśasana artha upapanna tvāt lohasya lohānām api durvāra tvāt aṇu mukha tvāt dūra prayojana kara tvāt ca śaraḥ eva adhikṛtaḥ | 	Since any amount of sharpness can be imparted to the point of an article made of iron and since it can be easily discharged from a distance, iron is the metal exclusively chosen in the construction of darts or arrows. 
sa dvividhaḥ karṇī ślakṣṇaḥ ca prāyeṇa vividha vṛkṣa patra puṣpa phala tulya ākṛtayaḥ vyākhyātāḥ vyāla mṛga pakṣi vaktra sadṛśāḥ ca || 	Arrows (Shara) may be divided into two classes according as they are feathered or unfeathered; and their barbs are usually constructed in the shape of trees, leaves, flowers, or fruits, or are made to resemble the mouths of birds and wild and ferocious animals. 
sarva śalyānām tu mahatām aṇūnām vā pañcavidhaḥ gati viśeṣaḥ ūrdhvam adhas arvācīnaḥ tiryak ṛjuḥ iti || 	The flights or directions of an arrow (Shalya) may be divided into five different kinds, such as the upward, the downward, the backward (coming from the back), the oblique and the straight. 
tāni vegakṣayāt pratighātāt vā tvac ādiṣu vraṇa vastuṣu avatiṣṭhante dhamani srotaḥ asthi vivara peśī prabhṛtiṣu vā śarīra pradeśeṣu || 	Either through its diminished momentum, or through any external resistance, an arrow may drop down and penetrate into the skin, arteries, or any internal channel of the body, or into any bone or its cavity, causing a wound or an ulcer (Vrana) at the spot of its penetration. 
tatra śalya lakṣaṇam ucyamānam upadhāraya | 	Now hear me describe the symptoms which are exhibited in connection with an arrow-wound (Shalya-Vrana[2]). 
tat tu dvividham sāmānyam vaiśeṣikam ca | 	These symptoms may be grouped under two sub-heads, such as the specific and the general. 
śyāvam piḍaka ācitam śopha vedanāvantam muhur muhur śoṇita āsrāviṇam budbuda vat unnatam mṛdu māṃsam ca vraṇam jānīyāt sa śalyaḥ ayam iti | sāmānyam etat lakṣaṇam uktam | 	The general characteristics are as follows:—The ulcer, which is marked by pain and swelling and presents a raised or bloated aspect like a water bubble, assumes a dark brown hue and appears soft to the touch. 
koṣṭha gate āṭopa ānāhau mūtra purīṣa āhāra darśanam ca vraṇa mukhāt marma gate marma viddhā vat ceṣṭate | 	The seat of the ulcer is seen to be studded over with pustular eruptions and a constant bleeding sets in from its inside. 
sūkṣma gatiṣu śalyeṣu etāni eva lakṣaṇāni aspaṣṭāni bhavanti || 	The specific symptoms, which mark a Shalya lodged in the skin, are the hardness and extended character of the local swelling and the darkness (discolouring) of its skin. 
mahānti alpāni vā śuddha dehānām anuloma sanniviṣṭāni rohanti viśeṣataḥ kaṇṭha srotaḥ siṛa tvac peśī asthi vivareṣu doṣa prakopa vyāyāma abhighāta ajīrṇebhyaḥ pracalitāni punar bādhante || 	The internal passages or channels (Srota) of the body are choked up and become inoperative, when the shaft is lodged in any one of them. 
sirā dhamanī srotaḥ snāyu pranaṣṭe khaṇḍa cakra saṃyukte yāne vyādhitam āropya āśu viṣame adhvani yāyāt yatra saṃrambhaḥ vedanā vā bhavati tatra śalyam jānīyāt asthi pranaṣṭe sneha sveda upapannāni asthīni bandhana pīḍanābhyām bhṛśam upācaret yatra saṃrambhaḥ vedanā vā abhavati tatra śalyam jānīyāt sandhi pranaṣṭe sneha sveda upapannān sandhīn prasaraṇa ākuñcana bandhana pīḍanaiḥ bhṛśam upācaret yatra saṃrambhaḥ vedanā vā b 	A flow of red and frothy blood with a gurgling sound, accompanied by thirst, nausea, and aching of the limbs, sets in when the arrow is lodged in an artery (Dhamani). 
ghaṭṭate bahuśas yatra srūyate tudyate api ca || 	Similarly, pain and swelling of diverse kinds mark a case where the shaft is embedded in a bone. 
asthi ātmakam bhajyate tu śalyam antar ca śīryate | 	The appearance of goose flesh on the skin, a stuffed sensation inside the cavity of the affected bone, and a violent piercing bone-ache, mark a case where the shaft has found a lodgment inside the cavity of a bone. 
prāyas nirbhujyate śārṅgam āyasam ca iti niścayaḥ || 	A pierced joint exhibits the same symptoms as described in connection with an arrow-lodged bone, with the exception that the patient is incapable of flexing and expanding the affected joint. 
viṣāṇa danta keśa asthi veṇu dāru upalāni tu 	In a case where the shaft (Shalya) has lodged in the abdomen (Koshtha), the bowels become constipated; the abdomen becomes distended with a rumbling in the intestines and the suppression of flatus and urine; and ingested food matter, as well as urine and feces are found to ooze out of the fissure or mouth of the ulcer. 
śalyāni na viśīryante śarīre mṛd mayāni ca || 	Symptoms, similar to those above described, manifest themselves when the arrow is lodged in any of the vital parts (Marmas) of the body. 
śalyam dvividham avabaddham anavabaddham ca || 	The preceding symptoms are but faintly exhibited in a case of superficial penetration. 
tatra aśru kṣavathu udgāra kāsa mūtra purīṣa anilaiḥ svabhāva bala pravṛttaiḥ nayana ādibhyaḥ patati māṃsa avagāḍham śalyam avidahyamānam pācayitvā prakothāt tasya pūya śoṇita vegāt gauravāt vā patati | 	An ulcer incidental to the penetration of an arrow (Shalya), along the direction of the local hair, in[4] the throat, in any internal channel of the body, or in a vein, the skin, or a muscle, or into a cavity of the bone, and not in any way affected by the action of the deranged bodily humours, may speedily and spontaneously heal; but it may break open and become painful afresh if the bodily humours become deranged and aggravated by a blow or physical exercise. 
bhinnam anirasyamānam pīḍanīyaiḥ pīḍayet pāṇibhiḥ vā | 	The shaft (Shalya) should be considered as lodged in that part which would be marked by pain, redness, or swelling (Samrambha) after such application. 
aṇūni akṣa śalyāni pariṣecana ādhmāpanaiḥ bāla vastra pāṇibhiḥ pramārjayet | 	As an alternative, the affected part should be plastered with clarified butter, common clay and sandal paste. 
uttuṇḍitam chitvā nirghātayet chedanīya mukham || 	Then, the part or the limb having been thus reduced with depletive measures, the shaft would be found to have been dislodged from its seat and to be moving about (within the deeper tissues of the affected part), giving rise to pain, redness and swelling. 
chedanīya mukhāni api kukṣi vakṣaḥ kakṣā vaṅkṣaṇa parśukā antara patitāni ca hasta śakyam yathāmārgeṇa hastena eva apahartum prayateta || 	In such a case the exact location of the shaft should be fixed at the spot where the pain and swelling, etc. 
bhavati ca atra | 	would occur. 
sirā snāyu vilagnam śalākā ādibhiḥ vimocya apanayet śvayathu grasta vāraṅgam samavapīḍya śvayathum durbala vāraṅgam kuśa ādibhiḥ baddhvā | 	In the case of a Shalya lodged in a vein, in an artery, in any external channel (Srota) of the body, or in a ligament, the patient should be made to ride in a carriage with a broken or lopped off wheel and dragged up and down in it on an undulating road The pain and swelling, etc. 
asthi vivara praviṣṭam asthi vidaṣṭam vā avagṛhya pādābhyām yantreṇa apaharet aśakyam evam vā balavadbhiḥ su parigṛhītasya yantreṇa grāhayitvā śalya vāraṅgam pravibhujya dhanuḥ guṇaiḥ baddha ekataḥ ca asya pañcāṅgyām upasaṃyatasya aśvasya vaktra kavike badhnīyāt atha enam kaśayā tāḍayet yathā unnamayan śiraḥ vegena śalyam uddharati dṛḍhām vā vṛkṣa śākhām avanamya tasyām pūrvavat baddhvā uddharet || 	incidental to the jolting, would occur at that part of his body, where the shaft (Shalya) is embedded. 
asthi śalyam anyat vā tiryak kaṇṭha āsaktam avekṣya keśoṇḍukam dṛḍha eka sūtra baddham drava bhakta upahitam pāyayet ākaṇṭhāt pūrṇa koṣṭham ca vāmayet vamataḥ ca śalya eka deśa saktam jñātvā sūtram sahasā tu ākṣipet mṛdunā vā dantadhāvana kūrcakena apaharet praṇudet vā antar | 	In the case of a shaft (Shalya) lodged in a bone, the affected bone should be lubricated and diaphorised with oil and heat respectively, after which it should be firmly pressed and bound up. 
śalya ākṛti viśeṣān ca sthānāni āvekṣya buddhimān | 	The seat of the pain or swelling, caused by such a procedure, would mark the exact locality of the embedded Shalya. 
tathā yantra pṛthak tvam ca samyak śalyam atha āharet || 	Similarly, in the case of a shaft (Shalya) lodged in a joint, the same lubricating, diaphorising, compressing, and expanding measures should be adopted, and the painful swelling caused thereby would indicate its exact locality. 
etaiḥ upāyaiḥ śalyam tu na eva niryātyate yadi | 	No definite method can be laid down as regards ascertaining the exact location of a Shalya lodged in any of the vital parts of the body (Marma), inasmuch as they are co-existing with (the eight different locations of ulcers, such as, the skin, the flesh, the bone, etc.)[5] 
śotha pākau rujaḥ ca ugrāḥ kuryāt śalyam anirhṛtam 	The part of the body, which is marked by pain and swelling, or which seems heavy and is marked by complete anaesthesia, or the part which the patient repeatedly handles, or constantly presses with his own hand, or which exudes any sort of secretion, and is marked by a sort of excruciating pain, or which he involuntarily withdraws from, or constantly guards against (an imaginary painful contact), should be regarded as clearly indicative of the exact location of the embedded Shalya. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne śalyāpanayanīyaḥ nāma saptaviṃśatitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ || aṣṭāviṃśatitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the twenty-sixth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of exploration of splinters. 
atha atas viparītāviparītavraṇavijñānīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter, which deals with the favourable or unfavourable prognosis of an ulcer. (Viparitaviparita-Vrana-Vijnaniya -adhyaya). 
phala agni jala vṛṣṭīnām puṣpa dhūma ambudāḥ yathā 	Certain fatal or unfavourable symptoms (Arishtas)[1] unmistakably presage the death of an ulcer-patient, as a flower, smoke and cloud respectively herald a fruit, fire and rain. 
tāni saukṣmyāt pramādāt vā tathā eva āśu vyatikramāt | gṛhyante na udgatāni ajñaiḥ mumūrṣoḥ na tu asaṃbhavāt || 	In most cases, the ignorant cannot interpret aright these fatal symptoms owing to their extremely subtile nature, or out of ignorance or stupidity, or because such symptoms are very closely followed by the death of the patient. 
dhruvam tu maraṇam riṣṭe brāhmaṇaiḥ tat kila amalaiḥ | 	These fatal indications serve as sure precursors of death in a patient, unless warded off by the blessings of holy Brahmanas, who are free from low desires or animal propensities, and are also accustomed to practise the Yoga and other religious penances; or death may be averted with the help of men who are initiated into the mystery of concocting life-giving elixirs (Rasayana). 
nakṣatra pīḍā bahudhā yathā kālam vipacyate | 	Many such indications do not prove instantly fatal but bring on death in course of time, just as diseases, supposed by some to be due to the influence of malignant planets, take time before they become patent out of their incubative stages. 
atas ariṣṭani yatnena lakṣayet kuśalaḥ bhiṣaj || 	An attempt to cure a doomed patient is only repaid by failure and the ridicule of the world, and hence an intelligent physician should make it worth his while to carefully observe and study these fatal indications. 
gandha varṇa rasa ādīnām viśeṣāṇām svabhāvataḥ | vaikṛtam yat tat ācaṣṭe vraṇinaḥ pakva lakṣaṇam || 	A contrariety of the natural smell, colour, taste, (sensation, sound, touch, etc.) of an ulcer indicates a near and fatal termination of the disease. 
kaṭuḥ tīkṣṇaḥ ca visraḥ ca gandhaḥ tu pavana ādibhiḥ | 	An ulcer emits a pungent, sharp, or fishy smell under the respective influences of the deranged Vayu, Pitta and Kapha. 
loha gandhiḥ tu raktena vyāmiśraḥ sāṃnipātikaḥ || 	An ulcer, deranged by the action of the vitiated blood, emits a smell like that of iron (Loha-gandhi), while one, originated through the concerted action of the deranged humours, emits a smell characterised by the distinctive features of each of them. 
jñeyāḥ prakṛti gandhāḥ syuḥ rataḥ anyat gandha vaikṛtam || 	All those odours, marked by a somewhat fishy character, should be deemed the natural odours of ulcers, and any other smell should be held as a contrary or unnatural one. 
sa gandhāḥ divya gandhāḥ ca mumūrṣūṇām vraṇāḥ smṛtāḥ || 	An ulcer emitting a sweet smell like that of wine, or fragrant aloe wood (Aguru), clarified-butter, Jati flower, Champaka, sandal, lotus or any celestial flower (Divyagandha), should be regarded as the precursor of death. 
śva vāji mūṣika dhvāṅkṣa pūti vallūra matkuṇaiḥ 	Similarly, a smell like the one which characterises a dog, horse, mole, crow or a bug, or like the one emitted by dry, putrid meat, or resembling the smell of earth or slime, should be likewise deemed unfavourable or fatal in an ulcer. 
kaṇḍūmantaḥ sthirāḥ śvetāḥ snigdhāḥ kapha nimittataḥ 	Similarly, an ulcer, which, though brought about through the action of the deranged Kapha, has become cold, hard and whitish as natural in one of the Kaphaja type, should be given up as soon as it is marked by a burning pain. 
kṣveḍanti ghurghurāyante jvalanti iva ca ye vraṇāḥ | 	An ulcer, which makes a gurgling or groaning sound, or one which is characterised by an extreme burning sensation, or is confined to the skin and the flesh, and is marked by the emission of wind with a loud report, is sure to have a fatal termination. 
dahyante ca antar atyartham bahis śītāḥ ca ye vraṇāḥ || 	Likewise, one, which is characterised by extreme pain, though not otherwise seated about any of the vital parts of the body, or which is cold on the surface, though attended with an extremely burning sensation in its inside and vice versa, should be deemed the precursor of death. 
śakti dhvaja rathā kunta vāji vāraṇa go vṛṣāḥ || 	Similarly, an ulcer should be regarded as fatal, that is shaped like the barb of a spear, or a Kunta (a kind of barbed dart or spear), or like a banner, chariot, horse, or an elephant, or like a cow, an ox, a temple, or a palace. 
varjayet tān bhiṣaj prājñaḥ saṃrakṣan ātmanaḥ yaśaḥ || 	A wise physician, with any regard to his own reputation, should abandon a patient laid up with an ulcer which appears to have been dusted over with a sort of pulverised crust, or who has been suffering from one accompanied by loss of flesh and strength, cough, difficult respiration and aversion to food. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne viparītāviparītavraṇavijñānīyaḥ nāma aṣṭaviṃśatitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ || 	Thus ends the twenty-eighth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita, which deals with the favourable and unfavourable prognosis of ulcers. 
atha atas viparītāviparītasvapnanidarśanīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter, which treats of favourable or unfavourable prognosis in diseases, as known from messengers, omens and dreams etc.

svebhyaḥ sthānebhyaḥ śarīra eka deśānām avasrasta utkṣipta bhrānta avakṣipta patita vimukta nirgata antargata guru laghu tvāni pravāla varṇa vyaṅga prādurbhāvaḥ vā api akasmāt sirāṇām ca darśanam lalāṭe nāsā vaṃśe vā piḍaka utpattiḥ lalāṭe prabhāta kāle svedaḥ netra rogāt vinā vā aśru pravṛttiḥ gomaya cūrṇa prakāśasya vā rajasaḥ darśanam uttamāṅge nilayanam vā kapota kaṅka kāka prabhṛtīnām sūtra purīṣa vṛddhiḥ abhuñjā 	(Similarly) a limb or a part of the body, hanging down from its natural position, or becoming raised or twisted round, or cast obliquely from its natural seat, or dislocated, or protruded, or drawn inward, or suddenly becoming light or heavy without any definite or assignable cause, or a sudden eruption of a coral-coloured rash or Vyanga, should be regarded as indicating a speedy dissolution of the patient in whom they are exhibited. Likewise, the appearance of veins in the region of the forehead, or an eruption of postules on the ridge of the nose, perspiration on the forehead in the morning, copious lachrymation without any ocular complaint, a sense of being dusted with dried and pulverised cowdung over the face, or the flying of pigeons, Kankas, etc, over one’s head, or excessive micturitions or motions of the bowels from an empty stomach, or a suppression of urine or feces even after a hearty meal or draught, is fatal.

Moreover the patient, whose semen, or expectorated or fecal matter does not float on water, or who sees the distorted or bifurcated images of objects, or whose hair shines with a gloss as if anointed with oil, finds his relief in death.

The patient, who falls to the ground bleating like a goat, and exhibits such symptoms as a rupture of the testes, numbness of the penis, drooping of the neck and introsusception of the penis, should be considered as past all cure. The patient, whose heart is first felt dry followed by becoming covered with a slimy moisture of the whole body, as well as one who strikes a stone with a stone, or a piece of wood with a piece of wood, or who cleaves in two blades of dried grass, or one who bites his lower lip and licks the upper one, or draws his ears and tears his hair, or dishonours the gods and the Brahmanas, as well as his own physician, friends and relations, should be regarded as beyond the pale of medicine. 
gṛha dāra śayana āsana yāna vāhana maṇi ratna upakaraṇa garhita lakṣaṇa nimitta prādurbhāvaḥ vā iti || bhavanti ca atra | 	Similarly, a disease due to the fact of one’s own house, wife, bed, seat, conveyance, or riding-animal assuming any ill-omened features, or a disease originated through the use of gems, utensils, garments, etc. 
cikitsyamānaḥ samyak ca vikāraḥ yaḥ abhivardhate | 	A disease, appearing in an enfeebled and emaciated subject and refusing to yield to a course of proper medicinal treatment, and which becomes rather aggravated by the administration of proper medicinal remedies or antidotes, necessarily portends the death of the patient. 
nivartate mahā vyādhiḥ sahasā yasya dehinaḥ | 	A Mahavyadhi[12] (lit:—a deep seated disease) suddenly abating in a person in whom nourishment fails to produce any perceptible effect forebodes a fatal termination. 
etāni ariṣṭa rūpāṇi samyak budhyeta yaḥ bhiṣaj | sādhya asādhya parīkṣāyām sa rājñaḥ saṃmataḥ bhavet || 	The physician, who can detect and fully interpret these fatal indications, is honoured by the king for determining the curable or incurable nature of a disease. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne svabhāvavipratipattiḥ nāma dvātriṃśaḥ adhyāyaḥ samāptaḥ || trayastriṃśattamaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the thirty-second Chapter of Sutrasthana in the Sushruta-Samhita which deals with the prognosis based on perversion of the natural appearances of the body. 
atha atas avāraṇīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter which treats of the mode of preserving the life of a king whose soldiers are on march (Yukta-Seniya-adhyaya). 
rakṣitavyaḥ viśeṣeṇa viṣāt eva narādhipaḥ || 	I shall presently describe the measures, which a physician in the king’s service should adopt with a view to protect the life of his royal master, specially from acts of secret poisoning, while mobilizing his armies to invade the territory of a neighbouring monarch accompanied by his chiefs and ministers. 
tasya liṅgam cikitsā ca kalpasthāne pravakṣyate || 	The symptoms and medical treatment will be fully described and discussed later on in the part, entitled the Kalpa Sthana. 
eka uttaram mṛtyu śatam atharvāṇaḥ pracakṣate | 	Men, learned in the lore of the Atharva Veda, hold that death may be attributed to a hundred and one different causes, (lit: deaths of a hundred and one kinds) of which one (which is that of an old man naturally and spontaneously expiring) is called natural, while the rest are unnatural or traumatic in their origin. 
rakṣetām nṛpatim nityam yattau vaidya purohitau || 	Physicians conversant with the curative virtues of drugs and minerals, and priests well versed in the Vedic Mantras, should jointly protect the king from death, whether due to idiopathic (Doshaja) or extrinsic causes. 
brahmā vedāṅgam aṣṭāṅgam āyurvedam abhāṣata | 	The god Brahma disclosed to the world the Atharva Veda together with the eight allied branches of Vedic literature and the science of medicine. 
purohita mate tasmāt varteta bhiṣaj ātmavān || 	And since a priest (Brahmana) is well-versed in the aforesaid branches of study, a physician should act subserviently and occupy a subordinate position to the priest. 
saṃkaraḥ sarva varṇānām praṇāśaḥ dharma karmaṇām | 	The death of a king usually leads to a political revolution or to popular disturbances and brings about a confusion among the vocations of the different orders of society. 
prajānām api ca ucchittiḥ nṛpa vyasana hetutaḥ || 	The growth of population markedly suffers through such catastrophies. 
cintayet nṛpatim vaidyaḥ śreyāṃsi icchan vicakṣaṇaḥ || 	As the external features of a king resemble those of a common person, while his (king’s) commanding majesty, sacrifice, forbearance and fortune are super-human (in their nature and intensity), therefore a man should, who is prudent and seeks his own good, think reverentially of his king, and propitiate him with tokens of loyalty and allegiance as if he were a deity. 
upasarpanti amohena viṣa śalya āmaya arditāḥ || 	A physician, fully equipped with a supply of medicine, should live in a camp not remote from the royal pavilion, and there the persons wounded by shafts of arrows or any other war projectiles, or suffering from the effects of any imbibed poison, should resort to him (the physician), conspicuous like a triumphant ensign for his fame and professional success. 
vaidyaḥ dhvajaḥ iva ābhāti nṛpa tadvidya pūjitaḥ || 	A physician, well versed in his own technical science, and commanding a fair knowledge of other allied branches of study as well, is glorified by his king and the Brahmanas, and is like a banner of victory an ennobling ornament to the state. 
vaidyaḥ vyādhi upasṛṣṭaḥ ca bheṣajam paricārakaḥ | 	The physician, the patient, the medicine, and the attendants (nurses) are the four essential factors of a course of medical treatment. 
vyādhim alpena kālena mahāntam api sādhayet || 	Even a dangerous disease is readily cured, or it may be expected to run a speedy course in the event of the preceding four factors being respectively found to be (qualified, self-controlled, genuine and intelligently watchful). 
vaidya hīnāḥ trayaḥ pādāḥ guṇavantaḥ api apārthakāḥ udgātṛ hotṛ brahmāṇaḥ yathā adhvaryum vinā adhvare || vaidyaḥ tu guṇavān ekaḥ tārayet āturān sadā | 	In the absence of a qualified physician the three remaining factors of treatment will prove abortive like a religious sacrifice performed with the help of an Udgatri,[1] a Hotri,[2] and a Brahmana, in the absence of an Adhvarya.[3] A qualified physician is alone capable of relieving the pain of many a suffering patient, just as only a helmsman is capable of taking his boat across a river even without the help and co-operation of a single oarsman. 
laghu hastaḥ śuciḥ śūraḥ sajja upaskara bheṣajaḥ || 	A physician, who is well versed in the science of medicine and has attended to the demonstrations of surgery and medicine, and who himself practises the healing art, and is clean, courageous, light-handed, fully equipped with supplies of medicine, surgical instruments and appliances, and who is intelligent, well read, and is a man of ready resources, and one commands a decent practice, and is further endowed with all moral virtues, is alone fit to be called a physician. 
āstikaḥ vaidya vākya sthaḥ vyādhitaḥ pādaḥ ucyate || 	The patient, who believes in a kind and all-merciful Providence, and possesses an unshakable fortitude and strong vital energy, and who is laid up with a curable form of disease, and is not greedy, and who further commands all the necessary articles at his disposal, and firmly adheres to the advice of his physician, is a patient of the proper or commendable type. 
praśasta deśa saṃbhūtam praśaste ahani ca uddhṛtam | 	The (proper) medicine is that which consists of drugs grown in countries most congenial to their growth, collected under the auspices of proper lunar phases and asterisms, and compounded in proper measures and proportions, and which is pleasing (exhilarating to the mind and has the property of subduing the deranged bodily humours without creating any discomfort to the patient, and which is harmless evert in an overdose, and is judiciously administered at the opportune moment. 
snigdhaḥ a jugupsuḥ balavān yuktaḥ vyādhita rakṣaṇe | 	That person alone is fit to nurse or to attend the bedside of a patient, who is cool-headed and pleasant in his demeanour, does not speak ill of any body, is strong and attentive to the requirements of the sick, and strictly and indefatigably follows the instructions of the physician. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne yuktasenīyaḥ nāma catustriṃśattamaḥ adhyāyaḥ || 	Thus ends the thirty-fourth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita, which treats of preserving the life of a king whose soldiers are on march. 
atha atas āturopakramaṇīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter which deals with clinical observations (Aturopakramaniya-adhyarya). 
āturam upakramamāṇena bhiṣajā āyuḥ ādau eva parīkṣitavyam sati āyuṣi vyādhi ṛtu agni vayaḥ deha bala sattva sātmya prakṛti bheṣaja deśān parīkṣeta || 	After that, the nature of the disease, the country and season of the year in which it has made its appearance, as well as the state of digestion, age, body, strength, disposition, habit, previous medicine, natural temperament and the power of endurance of the patient, etc. should be observed and carefully examined.

Those who have broad chests, broad eye-brows with broader spaces intervening between the muscles of the breasts, and who take in deeper inspirations of breath, will be long lived. Those whose necks, thighs, and generative organs are shorter than those of the average type, or those whose voices and umbilical cavities are deep, and whose breasts are unraised and thick-set, and external ears broad, fleshy and hairy, with the occipital region fully developed and protruded, will enjoy a longer span of life. 
tam ekāntena upakramet | 	The medical treatment of such a patient may be unhesitatingly taken in hand by a physician. 
ebhiḥ lakṣaṇaiḥ viparītaiḥ alpa āyuḥ miśraiḥ madhyamāyuḥ iti || 	Persons, exhibiting bodily features other than those described above, should be looked upon as short-lived men, while those, who are possessed of features common to men of both the above mentioned types, should be considered as keeping the mean between them as regards longevity (Madhyamayuh). 
śarīra jñāna vijñānaiḥ sa dīrgha āyuḥ samāsatas || 	A man, with deep-set bones, ligaments, and veins, and tough and thick-set limbs, and firm and unflinching sense organs, as well as one whose body gradually develops a more and more symmetrical shape, should be looked upon as a long-lived man The man, who has not ailed for a single moment even from the day of his birth, and has been getting more and more strong-limbed every day through the cultivation of his inborn sense and a better knowledge of the laws of health, is sure to live to a good old age in the full enjoyment of his senses and intellect.

jaghanyasya āyuṣaḥ jñānam atas ūrdhvam nibodha me || 	Now, hear me describe the specific traits, which characterise the body of a short-lived man.

The girth of the foot, as well as the circumference of the middle parts of thighs and knee-joints, respectively should measure fourteen fingers in width. The part of the leg between the ankle and the knee-joint should measure eighteen fingers’ width in length, while the part between the joint of the waist and the knee-joint should measure thirty-two fingers’ width in length, the entire leg thus measuring fifty fingers’ width in all.

The entire length of the vaginal canal should measure twelve fingers’ width. The space lying between the penis and the umbilicus, as well as the one intervening between the chest and the upper end of the throat (lit: neck), like the one lying between the tips of the two nipples of the breast, should measure twelve fingers’ width in length.

The girth round the wrist and the fore-arm of a man should measure twelve fingers.

dehaḥ svaiḥ aṅgulaiḥ eṣa yathāvat anukīrtitaḥ | 	The dimensions of the different limbs and members of the body, laid down above, should be understood as to have been measured by the standard of one’s (man’s or woman’s) own finger’s width, and a person, whose limbs and organs are found to correspond to the above-said measures, is sure to live to a good and hearty old age, as a necessary and befitting sequel to a happy and prosperous career in life. 
madhyamam madhaymaiḥ āyuḥ vittam hīnaiḥ tathā avaram || 	In the case of a partial correspondence of one’s limbs and organs to the above-said measures and proportions, a man should be regarded as having an average life and prosperity.

A man with a large head, and a large pair of shoulders, and having firm teeth, bones, cheek-bones, and finger-nails, should be considered as one in whom the principle of bone preponderates. A man with a large and bulky body, and who is capable of enduring a large amount of fatigue 01 -physical exertion, and who naturally talks in a soft and melodious voice, and whose bodily secretions such as urine and perspiration are characterised by coldness should be regarded as one of a fatty temperament. 
eṣām pūrvam pūrvam pradhānam āyuḥ saubhāgyayoḥ iti || 	In respect of worldly success and longevity, men of each of the aforesaid types should be successively judged inferior to men belonging to the one preceding it in the above order of enumeration.

vyādhi viśeṣāḥ tu prāk abhihitāḥ sarve eva ete trividhāḥ sādhyāḥ yāpyāḥ pratyākhyeyāḥ ca | 	All the diseases, whose names have been specifically enumerated before, may be grouped under any of the three different heads as the curable, the suppressible (Yapya) and the incurable (lit: fit to be pronounced as hopeless). 
tatra etān bhūyas tridhā parīkṣeta kim asau aupasargikaḥ prāk kevalaḥ anya lakṣaṇaḥ iti | 	Each of these different types, in its turn, should be carefully observed so as to determine whether it is a primary or an independent disease, or merely an accessory or sympathetic one, or the premonitory indication of an incipient distemper in its incubative stage. 
tatra aupasargikaḥ yaḥ pūrva utpannam vyādhim jaghanya kāla jātaḥ vyādhiḥ upasṛjati sa tad mūlaḥ eva upadrava saṃjñaḥ prāk kevalaḥ yaḥ prāk eva utpannaḥ vyādhiḥ apūrvarūpaḥ anupadravaḥ ca anya lakṣaṇaḥ yaḥ bhaviṣyat vyādhi khyāpakaḥ sa pūrvarūpa saṃjñaḥ | 	An Aupasargika (sympathetic) disease is merely a symptom developed in the course of an original or primary malady, and which has its foundation in the very nature or component factors of the pre-existing distemper. A disease, which manifests itself from the commencement of a case and is neither an accessory symptom, nor a premonitory indication of any other distemper, is called a Prak-kevala (primary or original) one. A disease which indicates the advent of a future or impending malady is called a Purvarupam (premonitory stage or indication of a disease). 
tatra sa upadravam anyonya avirodhena upakrameta blavantam upadravam vā prāk kevalam yathāsvam pratikurvīta anya lakṣaṇe tu ādi vyādhau prayateta || bhavati ca atra | 	A primary or independent malady, unattended with any of the distressing or unfavourable symptoms, should be treated according to its indications and the nature of the deranged humours involved therein, while in an incubative disease the treatment should consist in subduing a premonitory symptom as soon as it would make itself manifest. 
na asti rogaḥ vinā doṣaiḥ yasmāt tasmāt vicakṣaṇaḥ | 	As there is not a single disease, which can make its appearance without the participation of any of the deranged bodily humours, a wise physician is enjoined to administer medicines according to the specific features of the deranged humours involved in a disease whose nature and treatment have not even been described in any book on medicine. 
prāk abhihitāḥ ṛtavaḥ || 	The different seasons of the year have been described before. 
śīte śīta pratīkāram uṣṇe ca uṣṇa nivāraṇam 	In the cold season, a disease should be treated with measures and remedies endued with the virtue of destroying or warding off cold, while in summer the medicinal treatment should consist of measures and applications capable of allaying the heat. 
kṛtvā kuryāt kriyām prāptām kriyā kālam na hāpayet || 	The medical treatment of a disease should be commenced just at the opportune moment, which should not be allowed to expire in vain under any circumstances whatsoever. 
aprāpte vā kriyā kāle prāpte vā na kṛtā kriyā | kriyā hīnā atiriktā vā sādhyeṣu api na sidhyati || yā hi udīrṇam śamayati na anyam vyādhim karoti ca | 	A course of medical treatment commenced at an inopportune moment, or not resorted to at the advent of its proper time, as well as over or insufficient medication, proves abortive even in a curable type of disease. 
sā kriyā na tu yā vyādhim harati anyam udīrayet || 	The proper medical treatment (of a disease) is that which successfully copes with the malady under treatment, and arrests the recrudescence of a fresh one by way of sequel, and not that, which, though subduing a particular distemper, is immediately followed by a new one. 
prāk abhihitaḥ agniḥ annasya pācakaḥ | 	It has been demonstrated before that the food of a man is digested only with the help of the digestive fire or heat (Pachakagni), which may be divided into four different kinds (states). 
sa caturvidhaḥ bhavati doṣa anabhipannaḥ ekaḥ vikriyām āpannaḥ trividhaḥ bhavati viṣamaḥ vātena tīkṣṇaḥ pittena mandaḥ śleṣmaṇā caturtaḥ samaḥ sarva sāmyāt iti | 	One of these kinds is due to it not being in any way affected by the deranged humours of the body, while the other three are respectively ascribed to the fact of their becoming so deranged. The digestive fire or heat becomes irregular or fitful (Vishamagni) through the action of the deranged Vayu, becomes keen, through the action of the deranged Pitta, and dull or sluggish, through the action of the deranged Kapha. The fourth kind (Sama) continues in a state unaffected by any of the morbid humoural constituents of the body owing to their maintaining the normal equilibrium.

The digestive heat which is irregular in its action, and which sometimes helps the process of complete digestion, and produces distension of the abdomen, colic pain, constipation of the bowels, dysentery, ascites, heaviness of the limbs, trumbling in the intestines, and loose motions (diarrhea) at other times, is called Vishamagni. The digestive heat, which helps the digestion of even a heavy meal within an incredibly short space of time, is called “Keen” (Tikshnagni) and which becoming abnormally augmented begets an excessive or voracious appetite (Atyagni), helps a glutton to digest his frequent meals, and produces a parched throat, palate and lips, heat and other discomforts. 
viṣamaḥ vāta jān rogān tīkṣṇaḥ pitta nimitta jān 	The digestive fire of the Vishama kind brings on diseases characterised by the derangement of the Vayu. 
karoti agniḥ tathā mandaḥ vikārān kapha saṃbhavān || 	A keen (Tikshna) digestive fire brings on bilious (Pittaja) affections, while a sluggish (Manda) fire gives rise to diseases marked by a deranged state of the Kapha.

jāṭharaḥ bhagavān agniḥ īśvaraḥ annasya pācakaḥ | 	The fire, that burns within a person, is godly in its subtle essence, and possesses the divine attributes of atom-like invisibility, weightlessness, etc., and is the digestant of food. 
saukṣmyāt rasān ādadānaḥ vivektum na eva śakyate || 	It takes up the lymph chyle of different tastes for the purpose of digestion, and is invisible owing to its extremely subtle essence. 
prāṇa apāna samānaiḥ tu sarvatas pavanaiḥ tribhiḥ | 	The three vital Vayus known as Prana, Apana and Samana, located in their own spheres within the organism, feed it and keep it burning. 
vayaḥ tu trividham bālyam madhyam vṛddham iti | 	The three stages of man may be roughly described as 
tatra ūna ṣoḍaśa varṣāḥ bālāḥ te api trividhāḥ kṣīra pāḥ kṣīra anna ādāḥ anna ādāḥ iti | 	Childhood extends up to the sixteenth year of life, and children may be divided into three different classes, according as they are fed on milk, or on milk and boiled rice or on boiled rice alone. 
teṣu saṃvatsara parāḥ kṣīrapāḥ dvi saṃvatsara parāḥ kṣīra anna ādāḥ paratas anna ādāḥ iti | 	A child lives exclusively on milk up to the first year of its life, it is fed on milk and boiled rice (hard food) up to the second year, and is thenceforward nourished with boiled rice (hard food). 
ṣoḍaśa saptatyoḥ antare madhyam vayaḥ | tasya vikalpaḥ vṛddhiḥ yauvanam saṃpūrṇa tā hāniḥ iti | 	The middle age of a man extends from the sixteenth to the seventieth year of his life, and exhibits the traits of growth, youth, arrest of development and decay. 
tatra āviṃśateḥ vṛddhiḥ ātriṃśate yauvanam ācatvāriṃśataḥ sarva dhātu indriya bala vīrya saṃpūrṇa tā atas ūrdhvam īṣat parihāṇiḥ yāvat saptatiḥ iti | 	The process of growth or building goes on up to the twentieth year of life, when youth or the age of maturity sets in and holds sway over the body of a man up to the thirtieth year of his life,—the strength, semen, and all the organs and vital principles of the body attain (their) full maturity at the age of forty. Thenceforth decay gradually sets in up to the seventieth year of life.

bāle vivardhate śleṣmā madhyame pittam eva tu | 	Kapha is increased during the years of childhood and Pitta in middle age; while an increase of Vayu (nervous derangement) marks the closing years of life. 
agni kṣāra virekaiḥ tu bāla vṛddhau vivarjayet | 	The use of strong or drastic purgatives, and cauterisation are alike prohibited in cases of children and old men. 
tad sādhyeṣu vikāreṣu mṛdvīm kuryāt kriyām śanais || 	They should be used only in weakened or modified forms if found indispensably necessary. 
dehaḥ sthūlaḥ kṛśaḥ madhyaḥ iti prāk upadiṣṭaḥ || 	It has been stated before that the body of a person is either stout, thin or of an average (middling) bulk. 
karśayet bṛṃhayet ca api sadā sthūla kṛśau narau | 	A human body, which is neither too thin nor too stout, should be made to maintain its shapely rotundity. 
balam abhihita guṇam daurbalyam ca svabhāva deṣa jarā ādibhiḥ avekṣitavyam | 	Now in a particular case under treatment, it is primarily incumbent on the physician to enquire whether the patient is naturally weak, or has become so through a deranged condition of the bodily humours or old age. 
yasmāt balavataḥ sarva kriyā pravṛttiḥ tasmāt balam eva pradhānam adhikaraṇānām || 	And since it is the strength of a patient which makes all remedial measures (such as cauterisation, etc.) possible, it should be regarded as the grandest auxiliary to a medical treatment of whatsoever nature it may be. 
kecid kṛśāḥ prāṇavantaḥ sthūlāḥ ca alpa balāḥ narāḥ | yasmāt sthira tva vyāyāmaiḥ balam vaidyaḥ pratarkayet || 	There are some men who are strong though thin; while others are weak, though stout; and accordingly a physician should determine the bodily strength of a patient by enquiring about the capacity of his physical endurance and labour. 
sattvam tu vyasana abhyudaya kriyā ādi sthāneṣuva viklava karam || 	Sattvam or fortitude denotes a kind of (stoic) indifference of one’s mind to sensations and sources of pleasure or pain. 
sattvavān sahate sarvam saṃstabhya ātmānam ātamanā | 	A man of strong fortitude (Sattyika temperament) is capable of enduring everything, or any amount of pain by repressing his mind with the help of his will or intellect. 
sātmyāni tu deśa kāla jāti ṛtu roga vyāyāma udaka divāsvapna rasa prabhṛtīni prakṛti viruddhāni api yāni abādha karāṇi bhavanti || 	A particular country, or a season of the year, a particular disease or a peculiar mode of living, any particular kind of physical labour or exercise, or the specific properties of the water of any particular locality, or day sleep, or a juice of any particular taste, is or are said to be congenial (Satmya) to a man, or a man is said to be naturalised to these conditions and environments, when they fail to produce any injurious effect on his health, though naturally unwholesome to others. 
yaḥ rasaḥ kalpate yasya sukhāya eva niṣevitaḥ | 	A thing of any taste whatsoever, or any kind of habit or physical exercise is said to be congenial to a man which, instead of in any way telling on his health, contributes to his positive pleasure and comfort. 
deśaḥ tvā ānūpaḥ jāṅgalaḥ sādhāraṇaḥ iti | 	A country may be classed either as an anupa, Jangala or a Sadharana one, according to its distinctive physical features.

It is inhabited by a race of stout, shapely and soft-bodied men, susceptible to Vatala and Kaphaja diseases. The country, which presents a flat surface and whose dull monotony is enlivened here and there by scanty growths of thorny shrubs and the tops of a few isolated hills or knolls, and in which the waters from springs and wells, accumulated during the rains, become nearly drained, and strong gales of warm wind blow (during the greater part of the year) making its inhabitants, though thin, strong, tough, and sinewy in their frames, subject to attacks of diseases, is called Jangala. 
samāḥ sādhāraṇe yasmāt śīta varṣa ūṣma mārutāḥ | 	A country derives the epithet of Sadharana from the ordinary character of its heat, cold and rainfall, and from the fact of the bodily humours maintaining their normal state of equilibrium within its confines. 
ucite vartamānasya na asti deśa kṛtam bhayam | 	A disease originated in, and peculiar to a particular country fails to gain in intensity, if brought over to, and transplanted in a country of a different character. 
āhāra svapna ceṣṭā ādau tad deśasya guṇe sati || 	A man, who observes a regimen of diet and conduct soothing to the deranged bodily humours accumulated in the country he has come from, and aggravated and manifest in the shape of a disease in the country he has been living for the time being, need not apprehend any danger from the altered conditions of his new abode, for the fact of his not observing a regimen of diet and conduct regarded beneficial in consideration of the physical features of the latter place. 
deśa prakṛti sātmye tu viparītaḥ acira utthitaḥ saṃpattau bhiṣaj ādīnām bala sattva āyuṣām tathā || 	A disease of recent growth or origin unattended with any distressing or unfavourable complications, and unsuited to the nature of the country[2], the season of the year,[3] the temperament,[4] and[5] the adopted or congenial or naturalised traits of the physique of a patient with a regular and unimpaired state of digestion (Samagni), and who exhibits traits of strength, fortitude and longevity and commands the co-operation of the four commendable factors of a course of medical treatment, readily yields to medicine. 
atas anyathā tu asādhyaḥ syāt kṛcchraḥ vyāmiśra lakṣaṇaḥ || 	A disease, which is marked by features other than those described above, should be regarded as incurable, while the one exhibiting traits common to both the abovesaid types, should be looked upon as extremely hard to cure. 
pūrvasyām śantavegāyām na kriyā saṃkaraḥ hitaḥ || 	In the case of a former medicine proving abortive, a different one should not be resorted to as long as the effect of the first would last, inasmuch as a mixture or a confusion of medicinal remedies tends to produce a positively injurious effect. 
kartavyā eva tadā vyādhiḥ kṛcchra sādhyatamaḥ yadi || 	A medicine or any medicinal measure, failing to produce any tangible effect, may be repeated in quick succession in a difficult or dangerous disease, if it be empirically found to be beneficial in the case under treatment. 
yaḥ evam enam vidhim eka rūpam bibharti kāla ādi vaśena dhīmān | 	The intelligent physician, who, considering the nature of the season, etc., fully conforms to the abovesaid rules of medical treatment, conquers the bodily distempers and dispels the gloom of Death from the world with his medical skill.

atha atas bhūmipravibhāgīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter, which treats of miscellaneous remedies for swellings, etc.

A ground having a cool, glossy, white coloured soil, which is adjacent to water, and whose surface is covered with a lavish growth of glossy weeds and luscious shady trees, should be considered as characterised by the essential properties of water (Amvuguna). A ground having a gravelly soil of varied colours, and which contributes only to the germination of scanty and yellowish sprouts, should be looked upon as permeated with the attributes of essential fire (Agniguna). 
atra kecid āhuḥ ācāryāḥ prāvṛṣ varṣā śarad hemanta vasanta grīṣmeṣu yathāsaṃkhyam mūla patra tvac kṣīrasāra phalāni ādadīta iti tat tu na samyak saumya āgneya tvāt jagataḥ | 	According to certain authorities, the roots, leaves, bark, milky exudations, essence and fruits (seeds) of medicinal plants and herbs, should be respectively culled in the early part of the rains (Pravrit) and in the rainy season proper (Varsha), autumn, (Sharat), fore-winter (Hemanta), spring (Vasanta) and summer (Grishina). But we cannot subscribe to that opinion inasmuch as the nature or essential temperament of the earth is both cool (Saumya) and hot (agneya). 
saumyāni auṣadhāni saumyeṣu ṛtuṣu ādadīta āgneyāni āgneyeṣu evam avyāpanna guṇāni bhavanti | 	Accordingly drugs of cooling virtues should be culled during the cold seasons of the year, and the heat-making ones in the hot season, as they do not become divested of their native virtues at those seasons of the year. 
saumyāni auṣadhāni saumyeṣu ṛtuṣu gṛhītāni soma guṇa bhūyiṣṭhāyām bhūmau jātāni ati madhura snigdha śītāni jāyante | 	Medicinal plants of cooling virtues, which are grown on a soil of cool temperament and are culled during the cool seasons of the year, become intensely sweet, cooling and glossy. 
etena śeṣam vyākhyātam || 	These remarks hold good of other medicinal plants and herbs.

Herbs exercising both purgative and emetic virtues should be culled from ground exhibiting features common to both the two aforesaid classes of soil. Similarly, herbs possessed of soothing properties (Sanshamana)[1] are found to exert a stronger action in the event of their being reared on a soil permeated with the essential properties of sky. 
sarvāṇi eva ca abhinavāni anyatra madhu ghṛta guḍa pippalī viḍaṅgebhyaḥ teṣām asampattau atikrānta saṃvatsarāṇi ādadīta iti || 	All medicinal herbs and substances should be used as fresh as possible, excepting Pippali, Vidanga, Madhu, Guda, and Ghrita, (which should be used in a matured condition i.e. 
bhavanti ca atra | 	not before a year). 
gopālāḥ tāpasāḥ vyādhāḥ ye ca anye vana cāriṇaḥ 	Medicinal herbs and plants should be recognised and identified with the help of cowherds, hermits, huntsmen, forest-dwellers, and those who cull the fruits and edible roots of the forest. 
sarva avayava sādhyeṣu palāśa lavaṇa ādiṣu | 	No definite time can be laid down for the culling of the leaves and roots of medicinal plants, etc., such as are used in compounding the recipe, which is called the Patra-lavana, and which covers, within its therapeutic range, diseases, which are peculiar to the entire organism (such as Vata-vyadhi, etc).[2] 
gandha varṇa rasa upetā ṣaḍvidhā bhūmiḥ iṣyate | 	As soil admits of being divided into six different classes according to its smell, colour, taste, etc. 
tasmāt bhūmi svabhāvena bījinaḥ ṣaṣ rasa āyutāḥ || 	so the sap of a medicinal plant may assume any of the six different tastes through its contact with the peculiar properties of the soil it grows on. 
rasaḥ saḥ eva ca avyaktaḥ vyaktaḥ bhūmi rasāt bhavet || 	Tastes such as, sweet, etc., remain latent in water, which imparts them to the soil in a patent or perceptible condition. 
sarva lakṣaṇa saṃpannā bhūmiḥ sādhāraṇā smṛtā | 	A plot of ground, exhibiting traits peculiar to all the five fundamental material principles (such as the earth water, fire, etc.), is said to be possessed of a soil of general character (Sadharani Bhumi), and medicinal plants and herbs partake of the specific virtues of the soil they grown on. 
vigandhena aparāmṛṣṭam avipannam rasa ādibhiḥ | 	Drugs, whether fresh or old, and emitting a contrary smell, or in any way affected as regards their natural sap or juice, should not be used for pharmaceutical purposes. 
viḍaṅgam pippalī kṣaudram sarpiḥ ca api anavam hitam 	The virtues of such medicinal drugs and substances such as Vidanga, Pippali, Madhu, and Guda, improve (after a year). 
śeṣam anyat tu abhinavam gṛhṇīyāt doṣa varjitam || 	Accordingly all drugs and medicinal herbs, excepting the preceding ones, should be used fresh and unsoiled, or uninjured by insects. 
kṣīra mūtra purīṣāṇi jīrṇa āhāreṣu saṃharet || 	Blood, nails, or hair etc., of animals, (officinally laid down to be used in our Pharmacopeia), should be taken from young and healthy animals, and the ordure, urine, or milk of an animal, (enjoined to be used for medicinal purposes), should be collected at a time after it has completed its digestion. 
sāla sāra ādi sāreṣu paṭola triphalāsu ca 	The pharmacy and the medicinal store of a physician should occupy a commendable site and an auspicious quarter of the sky (North or East), and the collected medicines should be kept tied in pieces of clean linen, or stored in earthen vessels and hollow tubes of wood, or suspended on wooden pegs. 
iti śrī suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne miśrakādhyāyaḥ nāma saptatriṃśattamaḥ adhyāyaḥ || aṣṭatriṃśattamaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the thirty-seventh Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of the Classification of grounds for the culture of medicinal plants and herbs, etc.

samāsena gaṇāḥ hi ete proktāḥ teṣām tu vistaram | 	The groups of medicinal drugs and roots have thus been briefly described, which will be more elaborately dealt with later on in the chapter on Therapeutics. 
ebhiḥ lepān kaṣāyān ca tailam sarpīṃṣi pānakān | pravibhajya yathānyāyam kurvīta matimān bhiṣaj || 	An intelligent physician should prepare plasters, decoctions, medicated oils, Ghritas (medicated clarified butter) or potions, according to the exigencies of each individual case.[1] The groups enumerated above should be therapeutically used according to the nature of the deranged humours involved in each individual case. 
pṛthak niśrān samastān vā gaṇam vā vyasta saṃhatam || 	Only two, three or four drugs of the same medicinal group, or a similar number of drugs chosen from the the different groups, or a group of medicinal drugs in its entirety, or in combination with another, should be used according to the indications of any particular case, as the physician, in his discretion, would determine. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām sūtrasthāne dravyasaṃgrahaṇīyaḥ nāma aṣṭatriṃśaḥ adhyāyaḥ || ekonacatvāriṃśattamaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the thirty-eighth Chapter of the Sutrasthana in the Sushruta Samhita, which deals with the classification of drugs according to their therapeutical use. 
atha atas saṃśodhanasaṃśamanīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter, which treats of drugs and their flavours, virtues, potencies and chemical actions. 
atha atas dravyarasaguṇavīryavipākavijñānīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	(Dravya-Rasa-Guna-Virya-Vipaka-Vijnaniya-adhyaya). 
kecid ācāryāḥ bruvate dravyam pradhānam kasmāt vyavasthita tvāt iha khalu dravyam vyavasthitam na rasa ādayaḥ yathā āme phale ye rasa ādayaḥ te pakve na santi nitya tvāt ca nityam hi dravyam anityāḥ guṇāḥ yathā kalka ādi pravibhāgaḥ saḥ eva saṃpanna rasa gandhaḥ vyāpanna rasa gandhaḥ vā bhavati sva jāti avasthānāt ca yathā hi pārthivam dravyam anya bhāvam na gacchati evam śeṣāṇi pañca indriya grahaṇāt ca pañcabhiḥ indriyaiḥ gṛhyate dravyam na r 	As for example, a drug possessed of attributes peculiar to the fundamental matter, earth, can never be transformed into one of watery attributes—a truth which does not hold good of its attributes. Fourthly because, a drug or a substance is an object of all the five senses of a man, whereas its attributes of tastes, etc. are respectively accommodated to the faculty of special sense organs. 
yathā vidārigandhādim āhṛtya saṃkṣudya vipacet iti evamādiṣu na rasa ādiṣu ārambhaḥ śāstra prāmāṇyāt ca śāstre hi dravyam pradhānam upadeśe hi yogānām yathā mātuluṅga agnimanthau ca ityādau na rasa ādayaḥ upadiśyante krama apekṣita tvāt ca rasa ādīnām rasa ādayaḥ hi dravya kramam apekṣante yathā taruṇe taruṇāḥ saṃpūrṇe saṃpūrṇāḥ iti eka deśa sādhya tvāt ca dravyāṇām eka deśena api vyādhayaḥ sādhyante yathā mahā vṛkṣa 	As for example, it is quite natural to say that the drugs such as Vidari Gandha, etc., should be pressed and boiled. But it sounds preposterous to utter that the sweet taste should be pulverised and boiled. Seventhly because, the greater importance of a drug or substance has been laid down in the Shastras of medicines inasmuch as medical recipes have been described by the names of their component ingredients such as Matulunga, Agnimantha, etc., and not described as the tastes of Matulunga, Agnimantha etc. 
dravya lakṣaṇam tu kriyā guṇavat samavāyi kāraṇam iti || 	A substance or drug necessarily implies action and attributes with which it is intimately connected and of which it is the primary cause, or to put it more explicitly, these attributes have an inseparable inherence in and are intimately associated with the substance by way of cause and effect (Samavayi-Karana). 
na iti āhuḥ anye rasāḥ tu pradhānam kasmāt āgamāt āgamaḥ hi śāstram ucyate śāstre hi rasāḥ adhikṛtāḥ yathā rasa āyattaḥ āhāraḥ iti tasmin ca prāṇāḥ upadeśāt ca upadiśyante hi rasāḥ yathā madhura amla lavaṇāḥ vātam śamayanti anumānāt ca rasena hi anumīyate dravyam yathā madhuram iti ṛṣi vacanāt ca ṛṣi vacanam vedaḥ yathā kiṃcid ijyā artham madhuram āharet iti tasmāt rasāḥ pradhānam raseṣu guṇa saṃjñā 	Others, on the contrary, who do not endorse the above opinion, accord the highest importance to the attribute of taste (Rasa) of a drug or substance. Firstly because, it is so laid down in the Agamas (Vedas), which include the science of medicine (ayurveda Shastram) as well, and inasmuch as such statements as “Food is primarily contingent on its tastes and on food depends life” occur therein. Secondly because, the essential importance of taste may be inferred from such injunctions or instructions of the professors of medicine as, “sweet, acid and saline tastes soothe or pacify the deranged bodily Vayu.” Thirdly because, a drug or a substance is named after the nature of its taste, as a sweet drug, a saline substance, etc. 
rasa lakṣaṇam anyatra upadekṣyāmaḥ || 	But, later on, we shall have occasion to speak of that. 
na iti āhuḥ anye vīryam pradhānam iti | kasmāt tad vaśena auṣadha karma niṣpatteḥ | iha auṣadha karmāṇi ūrdhva adhobhāga ubhayabhāga saṃśodhana saṃśamana saṃgrāhaka agni dīpana pīḍana lekhana bṛṃhaṇa rasāyana vājīkaraṇa śvayathu kara vilayana dahana dāraṇa mādana prāṇa ghna viṣa praśamanāni vīrya prādhānyāt bhavanti | 	Certain authorities however, (who reject the two aforesaid theories), hold the potency (Viryam) of a drug to be the most important factor in medicine inasmuch as its therapeutic action, whether purgative, emetic, or both, or cathartic, or pacifying, or astringent, appetising, pressing (drawing to a definite head) or liquefacient, or constructive, tonic (vitalising) or aphrodisiac, or inflammatory, absorbing, caustic, or bursting, or intoxicating, soporific, killing or antitoxic, depends upon its potency. 
tat ca vīryam dvividham uṣṇam śītam ca agnīṣomīya tvāt jagataḥ | 	The potency of a drug is either cooling or heat-making owing to the twofold (hot and cool) nature of the temperament of the world. 
kecid aṣṭavidham āhuḥ śītam uṣṇam snigdham rūkṣam viśadam piccilam mṛdu tīkṣṇam ca iti | 	According to several authorities the potency of a medicinal drug may be classed as either hot or cool, emollient or dry, expansive or slimy, mild or keen, so as to embrace the eight different attributes in all. 
etāni vīryāṇi sva bala guṇa utkarṣāt rasam abhibhūya ātma karma kurvanti | 	These potencies of medicinal drugs serve their respective functions by overpowering their (drugs’) tastes with their specific strength (intensity) and virtues. 
yathā tāvat mahat pañcamūlam kaṣāyam tikta anurasam vātam śamayati uṣṇa vīrya tvāt tathā kulatthāḥ kaṣāyaḥ kaṭukaḥ palāṇḍuḥ sneha bhāvāt ca madhuraḥ ca ikṣu rasaḥ vātam vardhayati śīta vīrya tvāt kaṭukā pippalī pittam śamayati mṛdu śīta vīrya tvāt amlam āmalakam lavaṇam saidhavam ca tiktā kākamācī pittam vardhayati uṣṇa vīrya tvāt madhurāḥ matsyāḥ ca kaṭukam mūlakam śleṣmāṇam śamayati rūkṣa vīrya tvāt madhuram kṣ 	Similarly, an amalaka fruit, though acid in taste, and Saindhava, though saline, respectively tend to pacify the deranged Pitta. The drug Kakamachi, though of a bitter taste, and fish, though sweet, respectively aggravate the Pitta, owing to their thermogenetic potency. Similarly, Mulaka (Radish), though pungent, increases the Kapha of the body, on account of its emollient potency; and Kapittha, though acid, soothes; and honey, though sweet, tends to pacify the deranged Kapha owing to the dry character of its potency. 
ye rasāḥ vāta śamanāḥ bhavanti yadi teṣu vai | 	Tastes, which are possessed of dry, light or expansive potencies, fail to pacify the deranged Vayu, though otherwise they may prove soothing to that deranged humour. 
taikṣṇya auṣṇya laghu tāḥ ca eva na te tad karma kāriṇaḥ || 	Similarly, tastes, which are ordinarily reckoned as pacifiers of the deranged Pitta, fail to produce that effect in the event of their being endued with a keen, light or heat-making potency. 
ye rasāḥ śleṣma śamanāḥ bhavanti yadi teṣu vai | 	Likewise, tastes, which are commonly found to soothe the deranged Kapha, tend to aggravate it in the event of their being possessed of potencies which are respectively heavy, cool and emollient in their character.[1] Hence the potency of a drug is the most important factor in the science of medicine. 
kasmāt samyak nithyā vipāka tvāt iha sarva dravāṇi abhyavahṛtāni samyak nithyā vipakvāni guṇam doṣam vā janayanti | 	But certain authorities dissent from the above-said view, and attach the highest importance to the process of digestive (chemical) reaction (Vipaka) for the reason, that all ingested food, properly or improperly digested in the stomach, proves wholesome or otherwise to the body. 
tatra āhuḥ anye prati rasam pākaḥ iti | 	Certain authorities on the subject hold that digestion develops all the several tastes.[2]

tat tu na samyak bhūta guṇāt āmāt ca anyaḥ amlaḥ vipākaḥ na asti pittam hi vidagdham amla tām upaiti agneḥ manda tvāt yadi evam lavaṇaḥ api anyaḥ pākaḥ bhaviṣyanti śleṣmā hi vidagdhaḥ lavaṇa tām upaiti iti | 	The hypothesis of an acid digestion (reactionary acidity) does not preclude the possibility of a similar saline one owing to the participation of the natural taste (saline) of the bodily Kapha in the process of digestion, as is said of Pitta in the preceding instance. 
madhuraḥ madhurasya amlaḥ amlasya evam sarveṣām iti kecid āhuḥ dṛṣṭāntam ca upadiśanti yathā tāvat kṣīra mukha āgatam pacyamānam madhuram eva syāt tathā śāli yava mudga ādayaḥ prakīrṇāḥ svabhāvam uttara kāle api na parityajanti tadvat iti | 	Those, who adhere to the last named doctrine, endeavour to substantiate it by the following analogy, and argue that as milk kept boiling in a basin placed over a fire does not change its natural sweetness (with the change of its temperature), as cereals such as Shali-rice, wheat, barley, Mudga, etc. 
kecid vadanti abalavantaḥ balavatām vaśam āyānti iti | 	Others, on the contrary, assert that weak tastes are naturally merged in the strong ones in the course of digestion. 
āgame hi dvividhaḥ eva pākaḥ madhuraḥ kaṭukaḥ ca | tayoḥ madhura ākhyaḥ guruḥ kaṭuka ākhyaḥ laghuḥ iti | 	Only two kinds of digestion (digestive reactionary tastes) have been noticed in the Shastras, such as, the sweet and the pungent, the first being heavy and the second light.

dravyeṣu pacyamāneṣu yeṣu ambu pṛthivī guṇāḥ | 	Heaviness forms the characteristic attribute of earth and water, while lightness stands for the essential properties of fire, air and sky. 
nirvartante adhikāḥ tatra pākaḥ madhuraḥ ucyate || 	Hence the digestion of all food-stuff may be described as either heavy (Guru) or light (Laghu). 
tejaḥ anila ākāśa guṇāḥ pacyamāneṣu yeṣu tu | 	Of substances under the process of digestion, those, which are characterised by attributes, specifically belonging to earth and water, are called substances of sweet (heavy) digestion; while those which are permeated with the specific properties of air, fire and sky are called substances of pungent (light) digestion (easily digestible articles of food). 
pṛthaktva darśinām eṣa vādinām vāda saṃgrahaḥ | 	We have fully stated the text of the controversy as regards the primary importance of drugs and their tastes, virtues, potencies and digestive reactions, as well as the views of those who build their theories on the separate or exclusive importance of any of the five afore-said factors. 
catruṇām api sāmagryam icchanti atra vipaścitaḥ || 	The wise and the erudite set an equal importance to each of them, and ascribe the curative efficacy of a medicine to the co-operation of all these five factors. 
tat dravyam ātmanā kiṃcid kiṃcid vīryeṇa sevitam | kiṃcid rasa vipākābhyām doṣam hanti karoti vā || 	A drug or a substance sometimes destroys or originates a deranged condition of the humours through the dynamical action of its native or inherent properties, sometimes in virtue of its specific potency and sometimes by natural taste or digestive (chemical) reaction. 
pākaḥ na asti vinā vīryāt vīryam na asti vinā rasāt | 	Digestive reaction is impossible without drug potency. 
rasaḥ na asti vinā dravyāt dravyam śreṣṭhatam smṛtam || 	There is no potency without a taste, and taste without a drug or substance is an absurdity. 
janma tu dravya rasayoḥ anyonya āpekṣikam smṛtam | 	Hence a substance (vegetable or otherwise) is the greatest of them all. 
anyonya āpekṣikam janma yathā syāt deha dehinoḥ || 	A taste and a substance are correlative categories from the time of their origin, like a body and an embodied self in the plane of organic existence. 
vīrya saṃjñāḥ guṇāḥ ye aṣṭau te api dravya āśrayāḥ smṛtāḥ | raseṣu na bhavanti ete nirguṇāḥ tu guṇāḥ smṛtāḥ || 	Since an attribute per se can not be possessed of another attribute, the eight kinds of potency (properties) can only appertain to a substance and not to a taste, which is an attribute in itself. 
dravye dravyāṇi yasmāt hi vipacyante na ṣaṣ rasāḥ | 	Substances are digested in an organic body and not the six tastes simply for the reason of their being invisible and intangible in themselves. 
śreṣṭham dravyam atas jñeyam śeṣāḥ bhāvāḥ tad āśrayāḥ || 	Hence a substance is the greatest of all the aforesaid five factors (of substance, taste, virtues, etc.) and the attributes lie inherent in the substance. 
āgamena upayojyāni bheṣajāni vicakṣaṇaiḥ || 	Unscrutable and unthinkable are the virtues of drugs (medicines), which are above all rules of syllogism; and hence drugs (medicines), which have been observed to be efficacious from time immemorial, as well as those laid down in the scriptures on medicines, should alone be used in the course of a medical treatment, A learned physician should think it a sacrilege to logically dispute the efficacy of a medicine of tested virtue, and which has been adopted after generations of careful observation and is instinctively pronounced by men as a beneficial remedy. 
sahasroṇā api hetūnām na ambaṣṭha ādiḥ virecayet | 	No amount of logic will alter the nature of things, nor persuade the drugs of the Amboshtha group to exercise a purgative virtue. 
tasmāt tiṣṭhet tu matimān āgame na tu hetuṣu || 	Hence an intelligent physician should adhere to the officinal recipes given in the books on medicine, and not introduce innovations, however logical or probable, into the realms of applied or practical Therapeutics.

atha atas dravyaviśeṣavijñānīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter, which treats of the specific properties of drugs (Dravya-Vishesha-Vijnaniya-adhyaya).

śīta stimita snigdha manda guru sara sāndra mṛdu picchilam rasa bahulam īṣat kaṣāya amla lavaṇam madhura rasa prāyam āpyam tat snehana hlādana kledana bandhana viṣyandana karam iti || 	Similarly, a thing or substance, which is cold, moist, glossy, devoid of keenness, takes time to be digested, is mobile, compact, soft, slimy, sappy, and is largely endued with an acid, saline or sweet taste marked by a shade of astringent, is called a substance of dominant water (Apyam) principle. 
uṣṇa tīkṣṇa sūkṣma rūkṣa khara laghu viśadam rūpa bahulam īṣat amla lavaṇam kaṭuka rasa prāyam viśeṣataḥ ca ūrdhva gati svabhāvam iti taijasam tad dahana pacana dāraṇa tāpana prakāśana prabhā varṇa karam iti || 	A thing or substance, which is heat-making, pungent and keen, subtle in its essence, permeates the minutest capillaries, and is dry, rough, light, and non-slimy in its character and has strong properties and a taste which is largely pungent marked by a shade of saline, is called a substance of the dominant principle of fire (Taijasam). Such a thing naturally evinces an up-coursing tendency in the body, produces a burning sensation in its inside, helps the process of digestion and spontaneous bursting (of abscesses), increases the temperature of the body, strengthens the eyesight, improves the complexion and imparts a healthful glow to it. 
sūkṣma rūkṣa khara śiśira laghu viśadam sprarśa bahulam īṣat tiktam viśeṣataḥ kaṣāyam iti vāyavīyam tat vaiśadya lāghava glapana virūkṣaṇa vicāraṇa karam iti || 	A thing or substance, which is subtle in its essence, and is dry, rough, light, cold and non-slimy, increases tactual sensation and is endued with a largely astringent taste marked by a shade of bitter, is called a substance of the dominant principle of air (Vayaviyam). 
ślakṣṇa sūkṣma mṛdu vyavāyi viśada viviktam avyakta rasam śabda bahulam ākāśīyam tat mārdava śauṣirya lāghava karam iti || 	A thing or substance, which is smooth, unctuous, and is subtle in its nature, soft or pliant in its consistency, expansive in the internal organism), porous, soundy and nonslimy in its character without any definite taste, is called a substance of the dominant principle of sky (Akashiyam).

tāni yadā kurvanti sa kālaḥ yat kurvanti tat karma yena kurvanti tat vīryam yatra kurvanti tad adhikaranam yathā kurvanti saḥ upāyaḥ yat niṣpādayanti tat phalam iti || 	That, in which the action takes place, is called its receptacle or Adhikarana. The means by which it is effected is called its agency or Upaya, while that what it accomplishes is called its therapentic effect or Phala.

Drugs endued with emetic properties are possessed of attributes which form the characteristics of fire and air. Fire and air are light, and naturally ascend upward owing to their lightness. 
bhū tejaḥ vāri jaiḥ dravyaiḥ śamam yāti samīraṇaḥ 	Constructive or restorative (Vringhana) drugs or substances are endued with attributes which specifically belong to earth and water. 
bhūmi ambu vāyu jaiḥ pittam kṣipram āpnoti nirvṛtim || 	The deranged bodily Vayu readily yields to the curative efficacies of drugs possessed of attributes, specifically belonging to the earth, fire and water, while the deranged Pitta is speedily soothed or restored to its normal state by drugs having attributes, specifically belonging to the earth, water and air. 
kha tejaḥ nila jaiḥ śleṣmā śamam eti śarīriṇām | 	Similarly, the deranged Kapha is pacified by drugs possessed of attributes which characterise the sky, fire and air. 
viyat pavana jātābhyām vṛddhim āpnoti mārutaḥ || āgneyam eva yat dravyam tena pittam udīryate | 	The bodily Vayu is increased by the use of drugs possessed of attributes which specifically belong to the sky and air, while the Pitta is increased by the use of those which are largely endued with the specific attributes of fire. 
vasudhā jala jātābhyām balāsaḥ parivardhate || 	The bodily Kapha of the body is increased by the use of drugs which are largely endued with the specific attributes of the earth and water. 
dviśas vā bahuśas vā api jñātvā doṣeṣu ca ācaret || 	Thus having ascertained the dominant attributes of drugs, a physician should use them for the pacification of two or more of the deranged humours of the body according to the exigencies of a case.

Of these, oiliness and thermogenetic potency prove curative in respect of the deranged Vayu, while cooling potency, plastive potency, and that of engendering slime subdue the deranged Pitta. 
guru pākaḥ sṛṣṭa viṣ mūtra tayā kapha utkleśena ca laghuḥ baddha viṣ mūtra tayā māruta kopena ca | 	Substances, which are heavy in digestion, destroy the deranged Vayu and Pitta, while those which are light in digestion (easily digestible substances) prove curative in respect of the deranged Kapha. 
tatra tulya guṇeṣu bhūteṣu rasa vaiśeṣyam upalakṣayet tat yathā madhuraḥ guruḥ ca pārthivaḥ madhuraḥ snigdhaḥ ca āpyaḥ iti || 	Of these, softness, coldness and heat may be perceived by touch.

sthāna vṛddhi kṣayāḥ tasmāt dehinām dravya hetukāḥ || 	Properties, which characterise drugs and substances, may be as well found in a human organism, and the normal continuance, aggravation or diminution of the deranged humours is due to the action of the drugs (substances).

atha atas rasaviśeṣavijñānīyam adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ || 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter, which treats of the specific properties of flavours (Rasa-Vishesha-Vijnaniya-adhyaya). 
ākāśa pavana dahana toya bhūmiṣu yathāsaṅkhyam eka uttara parivṛddhāḥ śabda sparśa rūpa rasa gandhāḥ tasmāt āpyaḥ rasaḥ | 	The properties of sky (Akasha), air (Pavana), fire (Dahana), water (Toya) and earth (Bhumi) are sound touch, colour, taste and smell, each of the preceding elements possessing properties less by one than those of the one immediately succeeding it in the order of enumeration.[1] [Since a matter is designated after the name of the preponderant natural element, which enters into its composition], taste is said to be a water-origined principle. 
paraspara saṃsargāt paraspara anugrahāt paraspara anupraveśāt ca sarveṣu sarveṣām sāṃnidhyam asti utkarṣa apakarṣāt tu grahaṇam | 	All material elements are inseparably connected with one another, and there is a sort of interdependence among them, each one contributing to the continuance of the other and jointly entering, to a more or less extent, into the composition of all material substances. 
sa khalu āpyaḥ rasaḥ śeṣa bhūta saṃsargāt vidagdhaḥ ṣoḍhā vibhajyate tat yathā madhuraḥ amlaḥ lavaṇaḥ kaṭukaḥ tiktaḥ kaṣāyaḥ iti | 	This water-origined flavour (Rasa), which becoming modified through its contact with the rest of the material elements, admits of being divided into six different kinds, such as sweet, acid, saline, pungent, bitter and astringent. 
te ca bhūyas paraspara saṃsargāt triṣaṣṭidhā bhidyante | 	These, in their turn, being combined with one another, give rise to sixty-three different kinds.

A saline taste is mostly endued with attributes which characterise the elements of water and fire. A pungent taste is largely possessed of attributes, which mark the elementary principles of air and fire. 
tatra madhura amla lavaṇāḥ vāta ghnāḥ madhura tikta kaṣāyāḥ pita ghnāḥ kaṭu tikta kaṣāyāḥ śleṣma ghnāḥ || 	Tastes such as sweet, acid and saline are endued with the virtues of subduing Vayu. Tastes such as sweet, bitter and astringent are possessed of the virtue of subduing the deranged Pitta. 
tatra vāyoḥ ātmā eva ātmā pittam āgneyam śleṣmā saumyaḥ iti || 	The Vayu is a self-origined principle in the human organism. 
te ete rasāḥ sva yoni vardhanāḥ anya yoni praśamanāḥ ca || 	Tastes such as sweet, etc. 
kecid āhuḥ agnīṣomīya tvāt jagataḥ rasāḥ dvividhāḥ saumyāḥ āgneyāḥ ca | 	According to certain authorities, there are only two kinds of tastes, owing to the two-fold (hot and cold) nature of the temperament of the world. 
tatra madhura tikta kaṣāyāḥ saumyāḥ kaṭu amla lavaṇāḥ āgneyāḥ | 	Of these the tastes such as sweet, bitter and astringent are cold in their properties, while the pungent, acid and saline ones exercise fiery or heat making virtues. 
tatra madhura amla lavaṇāḥ snigdhāḥ guravaḥ ca kaṭu tikta kaṣāyāḥ rūkṣāḥ laghavaḥ ca saumyāḥ śītāḥ āgneyāḥ ca uṣṇāḥ || 	The tastes such as sweet, acid and saline are heavy and emollient in their character, while the pungent, astringent and bitter ones are dry and light. The watery (Saumya) tastes are cold. The fiery (Agneya) ones are hot.

A sweet taste, which is possessed of the same properties as the Kapha, respectively increases the sweetness, oiliness, heaviness, coldness and sliminess of the latter with the help of similar properties of its own.

A taste, which is pleasant, proves comfortable to, and contributes to the life-preservation of a man, keeps his mouth moist, and increases the quantity of bodily Kapha, is called Sweet (Madhura). A taste, which produces tooth-edge and increased salivation, and increases the relish for food, is called acid (Amla). 
yaḥ vaktram pariśoṣayati jihvām stambhayati kaṇṭham badhnāti hṛdayam karṣati pīḍayati ca sa kaṣāyaḥ || 	A taste, which brings about the dryness of the mouth, numbs the palate, obstructs the throat, and gives rise to a drawing, pressing sensation in the region of the heart, is called astringent (Kashaya).

Of these, the sweet taste is possessed of the virtue of increasing the quantity of lymph-chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone marrow, albumen (ojas), semen, and milk in a parturient woman. It materially contributes to the growth of bones, strengthens the eyesight, favours the growth of hair, improves the complexion of the body, brings about the adhesion of fractured bones (Sandhana), and purifies the blood and the lymph-chyle.

Owing to its fiery character, the taste under discussion sets in a process of suppuration in cuts or burns, or in incised, lacerated or punctured wounds, as well as in those, which result from external blows, or are due to fractures, swellings, or falls, or are brought about as the after effects of any idiopathic distemper, or which are tainted with the urine of any venomous animals or through contact with any poisonous animal or vermin. It gives rise to a burning sensation in the throat, chest and the region of the heart.

A saline taste, though possessed of the aforesaid properties, may bring on scabies urticaria, edematous swellings, loss or discoloration of the natural complexion of the body, loss of virile potency, distressing symptoms affecting the sense-organs, inflammation of the mouth and the eyes, hemoptysis, Vata-rakta (a kind of leprosy) and acid eructations etc., in the event of its being largely partaken of to the exclusion of all other tastes. A pungent taste is endued with appetising, resolving (Pacana) and purifying properties in respect of ulcers etc.), and destroys obesity, languor, deranged Kapha and intestinal parasites.

roga adhva pramadā madya vyāyāmaiḥ ca atipīḍanāt|| 	An over-indulgence in grief, excessive sexual intercourse, inordinate physical exercise, drinking large quantities of wine, observance of a regimen of diet and conduct in a particular season of the year which is improper to it, use of articles of food which are not congenial to one’s own temperament and an improper or baneful use of such oleaginous substances (as oil, clarified butter etc.) are the factors, which vitiate in common the blood and Pitta of a person. 
ṛtu sātmya viparyāsāt sneha ādīnām ca vibhramāt 	The foregoing causes especially tend to vitiate or agitate the Vayu and blood in persons of delicate constitutions, or in corpulent persons, or in those who observe a form of perfect continence.

tāsām pūrvarūpāṇi jvaraḥ vasti pīḍā arocakau mūtrakṛcchram vasti śiraḥ muṣka śephasām vedanā kṛcchra avasādaḥ basta gandhi tvam mūtrasya iti 	Here it becomes saturated with the urine, and gives rise to the formation of concretions or gravels in its cavity. An aching pain in the bladder, with a non-relish for food, difficulty in urination, an excruciating pain in the scrotum, penis, and the neck of the bladder, febrile symptoms, physical lassitude, and a goat-like smell in the urine are the symptoms, which indicate the formation of gravel in the bladder. 
yathāsva vedanā varṇam duṣṭam sāndram atha āvilam 	The deranged Doshas involved in a particular case respectively impart their specific colour to the urine, and determine the character of the accompanying pain. 
pūrvarūpe aśmanaḥ kṛcchrāt mūtram sṛjati mānavaḥ 	The urine becomes thick, turbid, and vitiated with the action of the aggravated Doshas, and micturition becomes extremely painful. 
atha jātāsu nābhi vasti sevanī mehaneṣu anyatamasmin mehataḥ vedanā mūtra dhārā saṅgaḥ sa rudhira mūtra tā mūtra vikiraṇam gomedaka prakāśam ati āvilam sa sikatam visṛjati 	The urine is stopped at intervals in its out-flow, or becomes charged with blood, or flows out twisted and scattered like spray, leaving a sediment of clear, sandy, red or yellow particles of stone, which resembles a Gomedha gem in colour. 
tatra śleṣma aśmarī śleṣmalam annam abhyavaharataḥ atyartham upalipya adhas parivṛddhim parivṛddhim prāpya vasti mukham adhiṣṭhāya srotaḥ niruṇaddhi | 	Stone or gravel, originated through the action of the deranged Kapha, saturated with an excessive quantity of that Dosha by the constant ingestion of phlegm-generating (Shleshmala) substances, increases in size at the lower orifice of the bladder and ultimately obstructs the passage of the urine. 
tasya mūtra pratighātāt dālyate bhidyate nistudyate iva ca vastiḥ guruḥ śītaḥ ca bhavati 	The pressure and recoil of that incarcerated fluid on the walls of the urinary bladder gives rise to a kind of crushing, bursting, pricking pain in that organ, which becomes cold and heavy. 
tām ślaiṣmikīm iti vidyāt|| 	This type is called Shleshmashmari. 
pitta yutaḥ tu śleṣmā saṃghātam upagamya yathā uktām parivṛddhim prāpya vasti mukham adhiṣṭhāya srotaḥ niruṇaddhi | 	The Kapha charged (dried) with the deranged Pitta becomes hard (condensed) and large in the aforesaid way, and lying at the mouth of the bladder obstructs the passage of the urine. 
tasya mūtra pratīghātāt ūṣyate cūṣyate dahyate pacyate iva vastiḥ uṣṇa vātaḥ ca bhavati 	The bladder, on account of the flowing back of the obstructed urine into its cavity, seems as if it has been exposed to the heat of an adjacent fire, boiling with the energy of an alkaline solution. A kind of sucking, drawing and burning pain is experienced in the organ. 
tām paittikīm iti vidyāt|| 	This type is called Pittaja Ashmari. 
vāta yutaḥ tu śleṣmā saṃghātam upagamya yathā uktām parivṛddhim prāpya vasti mukham adhiṣṭhāya srotaḥ niruṇaddhi | 	The deranged Kapha (mucus) inordinately saturated with the bodily Vayu, acquires hardness and gains in dimensions, and these lying at the mouth of the bladder obstructs the passage of the urine. 
tasya mūtra pratīghātāt tīvrā vedanā bhavati | 	The incarcerated fluid causes extreme pain in the organ. 
tadā atyartham pīḍyamānaḥ dantān khādati | nābhim pīḍayati | meḍhram pramṛdgāti | 	The patient constantly under severe pain gnashes his teeth or presses his umbilical region, or rubs his penis, or fingers his rectum (Payu) and loudly screams. 
tām vātikīm iti vidyāt|| 	This type is called Vatashmari. 
prāyeṇa etāḥ tisraḥ aśmaryaḥ divāsvapna samaśana adhyaśana śīta snigdha guru madhura āhāra priya tvāt viśeṣeṇa bālānām bhavanti 	Infants are more susceptible to an attack of any of the three preceding types of Ashmari, inasmuch as they are fond of day sleep or of food composed of both wholesome and unwholesome ingredients, and are in the habit of eating before the digestion of a previous meal, or of taking heavy, sweet, emollient and demulcent food. In children the bladder is of diminished size and poor in muscular structure. 
maithuna vighātāt atimaithunāt vā śukram calitam anirgacchat vimārga gamanāt anilaḥ abhitas saṃgṛhya meḍhra vṛṣaṇayoḥ antare saṃharati | 	A sudden or abrupt stoppage of a sexual act, or excessive coition tends to dislodge the semen from its natural receptacle in the body. 
saṃhṛtya ca upaśoṣayati 	The Vayu gathers up the fluid (semen), thus led astray, and deposits it (in a round or oval shape) at a place lying about the junction of the penis and the scrotum and dries up the humidity with which it is charged. 
mūtrakṛcchram vasti vedanām vṛṣaṇayoḥ ca śvayathum āpādayati | 	The matter, thus formed, condensed, and hardened, is called the seminal stone (Sukrashmari), which then obstructs the passage of the urine, giving rise to pain in the bladder, painful micturition, and swelling of the scrotum. 
pīḍita mātre ca tasmin eva praveśe pravilayam āpadyate 	The stone vanishes under pressure in its seat[2]. 
śarkarā sikatā mehaḥ bhasma ākhyaḥ aśmarī vaikṛtam 	Concretions, sands and sediments found to be deposited in the urine in a case of Bhashma-meha are but the modifications, or attendant symptoms of a case of stone in the bladder (Ashmari). 
aśmaryā śarkarā jñeyā tulya vyañjana vedanā|| 	The same group of symptoms and the same kind of pain are exhibited and experienced in a case of gravel (Sharkara) as in a case of stone (Ashmari) in the bladder. 
pavane anuguṇe sā tu nireti alpā viśeṣataḥ 	The local Vayu coursing in its natural direction helps the discharge of calculi (Ashmari) with the urine in the event of they being extremely attenuated in structure. 
sā bhinna mūrtiḥ vātena śarkarā iti abhidhīyate 	Particles of a stone broken by the Vayu are called urinary calculi (Sharkara). 
hṛd pīḍā sakthi sadanam kukṣi śūlam ca vepathuḥ tṛṣṇā ūrdhva gaḥ anilaḥ kārṣṇyam daurbalyam pāṇḍu gātra tā arocakra avipākau tu śarkarā ārte bhavanti ca 	A pain about the cardiac region, a sense of weakness and lassitude in the thighs, a griping pain in the regions of the spleen and liver (Kukshi-shula), a shivering sensation, thirst, hiccough or eructations, darkness or sallowness of complexion, weakness, emaciation with a non-relish for food and impaired digestion are the symptoms which are manifest in a gravel-patient. 
daurbalyam sadanam kārśyam kukṣi śūlam arocakam pāṇḍu tvam uṣṇa vātam ca tṛṣṇām hṛd pīḍanam vamim|| 	A gravel (Sharkara) obstructed at the mouth of the urinary channel is detected by the following indications:—vis., weakness, lassitude, emaciation, cachectic condition of the body, pain over the hepatic region (Kukshi-shula), a non-relish for food, sallowness of complexion, hot and high coloured urine, thirst, pressing pain at the cardiac region and vomiting. 
nābhi pṛṣṭha kaṭu muṣka guda vaṅkṣaṇa śephasām eka vāraḥ tanu tvakkaḥ madhye vastiḥ adhomukhaḥ 	This organ is provided with a single aperture or opening and lies with its mouth downward, covered with nets of nerves (Shira) and ligaments (Snayu), in the shape of a gourd. 
eka saṃbandhinaḥ hi ete guda asthi vivara āśritāḥ 	The organ is extremely thin in structure; and thus situated within the pelvic cavity, it is connected, through its mouth or external orifice, with the rectum, the penis, and the testes. 
mūtrāśayaḥ mala ādhāraḥ prāṇa āyatanam uttamam 	It is also known by the name of Maladhara (the receptacle of impure matter) and forms (one of) the primary seats of vital energy (Prana)[3]. 
pakvāśaya gatāḥ tatra nāḍyaḥ mūtra vahāḥ tu yāḥ tarpayanti sadā mūtram saritaḥ sāgaram yathā || 	The urinary ducts (ureters) pass close by the large intestines (Pakvasaya) and constantly replenish the bladder and keep it moist with that waste product of the system in the same manner as rivers carry their contributions of water into the ocean. 
sūkṣma tvāt na upalabhyante mukhāni āsām sahasraśas nāḍībhiḥ upanītasya mūtrasya āmāśaya antarāt jāgrataḥ svapataḥ ca eva sa niḥsyandena pūryate 	These passages or ducts (which are two) are found to take their origin from hundreds of branches (or mouths tubuli uriniferi), which are not visible to the naked eyes, on account of their extremely attenuated structures and carry, whether in a state of sleep or wakening, the urine from below the region of the  stomach[4] (Amashaya) into the bladder keeping it filled with this important fluid of the body, just as a new pitcher, immersed up to its neck in a vessel full of water, is filled by transudation through its lateral pores. 
ghaṭaḥ yathā tathā viddhi vastiḥ mūtreṇa pūryate 	In the same way the Vayu, Kapha and Pitta are carried into the bladder (through their respective ducts or channels), and in unison with the retained urine, give rise to the formation of stone, on account of the slimy character of the deposit produced. 
apsu su acchā(sthāsu api yathā niṣiktāsu nave ghaṭe kāla antareṇa paṅkaḥ syāt aśmarī saṃbhavaḥ tathā 	Stone is formed in the same way in the bladder as sediments are ultimately deposited from clear and transparent water at the bottom of a new pitcher which contains it. 
tadvat valāsam vasti stham ūṣmā saṃhanti sa anilaḥ 	As the wind and lightning jointly condense the rainwater into hailstones, so the bodily Vayu and Pitta (heat) jointly contribute to the condensation of the Kapha in the bladder and transform it into stone. 
mārute praguṇe vastau mūtram samyak pravartate vikārāḥ vividhāḥ ca api pratilome bhavanti hi mūtrāghātāḥ pramehāḥ ca śukra doṣāḥ tathā eva ca 	The Vayu in the bladder, coursing in its natural downward direction, helps the full and complete emission of urine; while coursing in a contrary direction, it gives rise to various forms of maladies such as, Prameha, strangury, as well as seminal disorders; in short, it produces any urinary trouble to which the bladder may be subjected. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām nidāna sthāne aśmarīnidānam nāma tṛtīyaḥ adhyāyaḥ|| 	Thus ends the third Chapter of the Nidana Sthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of the Nidana of urinary calculi. 
atha atas kuṣṭhanidānam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the Nidana of Kushtha (cutaneous affections in general), 1. 
mithyā āhāra ācārasya viśeṣāt guru viruddha asātmya ajīrṇa ahita āśinaḥ sneha pītasya vāntasya vā vyāyāma grāmya dharma sevinaḥ grāmya ānūpa audaka māṃsāni vā payasā abhīkṣṇam aśnataḥ yaḥ vā majjati apsu ūṣma abhitaptaḥ sahasā achardim vā pratihanti | 	Improper diet or conduct; especially ingestion of improper, unwholesome, indigestible, or incongenial food; physical exercise or sexual intercourse immediately after partaking of any oleaginous substance, or after vomiting; constant use of milk in combination with the meat of any domestic, aquatic or amphibious animal; a cold water bath after an exposure to heat; and repression of any natural urging for vomiting etc. are the factors which tend to derange and aggravate the fundamental principle of Vayu in a person. The enraged or aggravated Vayu, in combination with the agitated Pitta and Kapha, enters into the vessels or ducts (Shira), which transversely spread over the surface of the body. 
tasya pitta śleṣmāṇau prakupitau parigṛhya anilaḥ pravṛddhaḥ tiryak gāḥ sirāḥ sarprapadya samuddhūya bāhyam mārgam prati samantāt vikṣipati | 	Thus the enraged Vayu deposits the Pitta and Kapha on the skin through the medium of their channels and spreads them over the entire surface of the body. 
yatra yatra ca doṣaḥ vikṣiptaḥ niścarati tatra tatra maṇḍalāni prādurbhavanti | 	The regions of the skin in which the aforesaid morbific diatheses are deposited become marked with circular rings or patches. 
evam samutpannaḥ tvaci doṣaḥ tatra tatra ca parivṛddhim prāpya a pratikriyamāṇaḥ abhyantaram pratipadyate dhātūn abhidūṣayan 	The morbific diatheses (Doshas), thus lodged in the skin, continue to aggravate, and having been neglected at the outset, tend to enter into the deeper tissues and thus contaminate the fundamental principles (Dhatus) of the body. 
tasya pūrvarūpāṇi tvac pāruṣyam akasmāt romaharṣaḥ kaṇḍūḥ sveda bāhulyam asvedanam vā aṅga pradeśānām svāpaḥ kṣata visarpaṇam asṛjaḥ kṛṣṇa tā ca iti 	A roughness of the skin, sudden horripilation, an itching sensation in the surface of the body, excess or absence of perspiration, anethesia of the parts, a black colour of the blood, and a rapid growth and expansion of any ulcer (appearing on the body) are the symptoms which mark the premonitory stages of Kushtha. 
tatra sapta mahākuṣṭhāni | ekādaśa kṣudrakuṣṭhāni | evam aṣṭādaśa kuṣṭhāni bhavanti 	[Diseases, falling under the group of Kushtha, may be divided into two broad subdivisions], viz—Mahakushthas (major) and Kshudra (minor) Kushthas, the first consisting of seven, and the second of eleven different types, aggregating eighteen in all. 
tatra mahākuṣṭhāni aruṇa udumbara ṛṣya jihva kapāla kākaṇaka iti| 	The Mahakushthas are classified as, 
kṣudrakuṣṭhāni api sthūlāruṣkam mahākuṣṭham ekakuṣṭham carmadalam visarpaḥ parisarpaḥ sidhmam vicarcikā kiṭibham pāmā cakasā ca iti|| 	The minor or Kshudra-kushthas (Lichen and Dermatitis) are 
sarvāṇi kuṣṭhāni sa vātāni sa pittāni sa śleṣmāṇi sa krimīṇi ca bhavanti | utsannataḥ tu doṣa grahaṇam abhibhavāt 	All the types of Kushtha, whether major or minor, involve the action of the deranged Vayu, Pitta or Kapha, and are connected with the presence of parasites in those localities.[1] The preponderance of any particular morbific diathesis (Dosha) in any case of Kushtha should be looked upon as its originating cause. 
teṣām mahat tvam kriyā guru tvam uttarottaram dhātu anupraveśāt asādhya tvam ca iti|| tatra tatra 	These types of major or minor Kushthas are successively more extensive in their action and more incurable on account of their respectively invading a greater number of the bodily elements (Dhatus). 
vātena aruṇa ābhāni tanūni visarpīṇi toda bheda svāpa yuktāni aruṇāni 	It is slightly vermilion-coloured, thin and spreading in its nature. 
pittena pakva udumbara phala ākṛti varṇāni audumbarāṇi | 	The type known as Audumbara is coloured and shaped like a ripe or mature Audumbara fruit and has its origin in the deranged Pitta.

atasī puṣpa varṇāni tāmrāṇi vā visarpīṇi piḍakāvanti ca dadru kuṣṭhāni 	The patches resemble the petals of a (full blown) lotus flower in colour, and Dadru (Ringworm) assumes the colour (Taint blue) of an Atasi flower, or of copper. They are spreading in their nature and are found to be overspread with pustules. 
kṣudrakuṣṭhāni atas ūrdhvam vakṣyāmaḥ --- 	We shall now describe (the features of the diseases known as) Kshudra-kushthas (M.Text):—The type known as Sthularushka appears about the joints. 
sthūlāni sandhiṣu ati dāruṇāni sthūla aruṣi syuḥ kaṭhināni arūṃṣi 	It is extremely thick at its base, is cured with the greatest difficulty, and is strewn over with hard pustules (Arungshi). 
tvac koca bheda svapana aṅga sādāḥ kuṣṭhe mahat pūrva yute bhavanti|| 	In the type known as of Mahakushtha the skin contracts, and with the bursting of the skin (a piercing pain is felt in the affected part), which loses all sensibility to the touch, accompanied by a general sense of lassitude in the limbs.

syuḥ yena kaṇḍū vyathana oṣa coṣāḥ taleṣu tat carma dalam vadanti 	In the form known as Carmadala (Hypertrophy of the skin) a burning, sucking, drawing pain is experienced in the palms of the hands and in the soles of the feet which become characterised with an itching sensation. 
visarpa vat sarpati sarvatas yaḥ tvac rakta māṃsāni abhibhūya śīghram 	The disease, which affects in succession the (organic principles of) skin, blood and flesh, and speedily extends all over the body, like Erysipelas, and is attended with a burning sensation (Vidaha), restlessness, suppuration and a piercing pain and loss of consciousness (epileptic fits), is called Visarpa Kushtha. 
śanais śarīre piḍakāḥ sravantyaḥ sarpanti yāḥ tam parisarpam āhuḥ 	The form in which a number of exuding pustules gradually extend over the surface of the body is called Parisarpa Kushtha. 
kaṇḍū anvitam śvetam apāyi sidhma vidyāt tanu prāyaśas ūrdhva kāye 	The type of the disease which is white and thin, and is characterised by itching and does not create any disturbance (in the patient), is called Sidhma (Macule atrophice).

kaṇḍūmatī dāha rujā upapannā vipādikā pāda gatā iyam eva 	The same form of malady attended with pain, burning and itching, and restricting itself solely to the lower extremities, is called Vipadika. 
yat srāvi vṛttam ghanam ugra kaṇḍu tat snigdha kṛṣṇam kiṭibham vadanti 	The type in which the eruptions exude (a kind of slimy secretion) and which are circular, thick, excessively itching, glossy and black-coloured is called Kitima (Keloid tumours). 
sphoṭaiḥ sa dāhaiḥ ati sā eva kacchūḥ sphic pāṇi pāda prabhavaiḥ nirūpyā 	The preceding kinds of pimples attended with burning vesicles, are called Kaccus and are found to be chiefly confined to the legs, hands and buttocks. 
aruḥ sa sidhmam rakasā mahat ca yat ca eka kuṣṭham kapha jāni amūni 	The forms known as Sthularushka, Sidhma, Rakasa, Mahakushtha and Ekakushtha should be considered as offspring of the deranged Kapha. 
vāyoḥ prakopāt parisarpam ekam śeṣāṇi pitta prabhavāṇi vidyāt|| 	Parisarpa-kushtha alone is due to the action of the deranged Vayu, while the remaining types (of minor Kushtha) owe their origin to the action of the deranged Pitta. 
kilāsam api kuṣṭha vikalpaḥ eva 	The disease known as Kilasam is but another form of Kushtha. 
śleṣmaṇā ca iti kuṣṭha kilāsayoḥ antaram tvac gatam eva kilāsam aparisrāvi ca tad vātena maṇḍalam aruṇam paruṣam paridhvaṃsi ca | 	The difference between Kilasam and Kushtha is that the former confines itself only to the Tvaka (the skin)and is marked by the absence of any secretion.[2] A case of Kilasam caused by the action of the deranged Vayu is circular, vermilion-coloured and rough to the touch. 
pittena padma patra pratīkāśam sa paridāham ca | 	A case of Kilasam, due to the action of the deranged Pitta, is marked by eruptions, resembling the petals of a lotus flower (in shape and colour), and are attended with an extremely burning sensation. 
śleṣmaṇā śvetam snigdham bahalam kaṇḍūmat ca 	In the type originated through the action of the deranged Kapha, the affected part (skin) assumes a glossy, white colour, becomes thick and is marked by an itching sensation.

kuṣṭheṣu tu tvac saṃkoca svāpa sveda śopha bheda kauṇya svara upaghātāḥ vātena | 	A preponderance of the deranged Vayu in a case of Kushtha (leprosy) is indicated by a contraction of the skin, local anesthesia, a copious flow of perspiration, swelling, and piercing or cutting pain in the affected part, together with a deformity of the limbs and hoarseness. 
pāka avadaraṇa aṅguli patana karṇa nāsā bhaṅga akṣi rāga sattva utpattayaḥ pittena | 	Similarly, an excess of the deranged Pitta in a case of Kushtha, should be presumed from the suppuration of the affected part, from the breaking of the local skin, from the falling off of the fingers, from the sinking of the nose and ears, from the redness of the eyes and from the germination of parasites in the incidental ulcer. 
kaṇḍū varṇabheda śopha āsrāva gauravāṇi śleṣmaṇā|| 	An excessive action of the deranged Kapha, in a case of Kushtha, gives rise to itching, discolouring and swelling of the affected part which becomes heavy and exudes the characteristic secretion. 
tatra ādi bala pravṛttam pauṇḍarīkam kākaṇam ca asādhyam 	The types, Pundarika and Kakana, which are due to the germinal defect of the patient, are incurable, inasmuch as they involve (according to Dallana) the concerted action of the three simultaneously deranged Doshas from the very outset. 
yathā banaspatiḥ jātaḥ prāpya kāla prakarṣaṇam antar bhūmim vigāheta mūlaiḥ vṛṣṭi vivardhitaiḥ evam kuṣṭham samutpannam tvaci kāla prakarṣataḥ 	As a tree, full grown in the course of time, has driven its roots, which derive their nourishment from the rain water, deeper and deeper into the successive strata of the soil, so this disease (Kushtha), first affecting and confining itself to the upper layers of the skin, will invade the deeper tissues and organs etc. 
krameṇa dhātūn vyāpnoti narasya apratikāriṇaḥ 	of the patient, if unchecked until almost all the fundamental principles or elements Dhatus are attacked by its virus in the course of time.

kauṇyam gati kṣayaḥ aṅgānām saṃbhedaḥ kṣata sarpaṇam śukra sthāna gate liṅgam prāk uktāni tathā eva ca 	Symptoms of the disease restricting itself only to the principle of semen are a crippled state of the hands and distortion of the limbs, loss of the power of locomotion, spreading of ulcers and all the other symptoms peculiar to the preceding types of the disease. 
yat apatyam tayoḥ jātam jñeyam tat api kuṣṭhitam 	A child, which is the offspring of the contaminated semen and ovum of its parents afflicted with Kushtha, should be likewise regarded as a Kushthi. 
kuṣṭham ātmavataḥ sādhyam tvac rakta piśita āśritam 	A case of Kushtha appearing in a person of prudence and discretion and confined only to the serum (Tvaka), flesh and blood of his organism should be regarded as curable. 
medaḥ gatam bhavet yāpyam asādhyam atas uttaram 	A palliative treatment is the only remedy in cases where the disease is found to invade the principle of fat; whereas a case where the poison is found to have penetrated into any of the remaining organic principles should be given up as incurable. 
brahma strī sat jana vadha para sva haraṇa ādibhiḥ karmabhiḥ pāpa rogasya prāhuḥ kuṣṭhasya saṃbhavam 	Wise men hold that, for killing a Brahmana, or a woman, or one of his own relations, for theft, as well as for doing acts of impiety, a man is sometimes cursed with this foul disease by way of divine retribution. 
mriyate yadi kuṣṭhena punar jāte api gacchati 	The disease reattacks a man even in his next rebirth in the event of his dying with it.

saha śayyā āsanāt ca api vastra mālya anulepanāt 	Kushtha (Leprosy) is a highly contagious disease; the contagion being usually communicated through sexual intercourse with a leper (Kushthi), or by his touch or breath, or through partaking of the same bed, and eating and drinking out of the same vessel with him, or through using the wearing apparel, unguents and garlands of flowers previously used by a person afflicted with this dreadful disease. 
aupasargika rogāḥ ca saṃkrāmanti narān naram 	Kushtha (Leprosy), fever, pulmonary consumption, ophthalmia and other Aupasargika disease (incidental to the influences of malignant planets or due to the effects of impious deeds) are communicated from one person to another.

Thus deranged, they carry down through the urinary ducts the deranged fat, etc[1] of the body and find lodgment at the mouth (neck) of the bladder, whence they are emitted through the urethra[2], causing diseases, known by the (generic) name of Prameha.

tatra āvila prabhūta mūtra lakṣaṇāḥ sarve eva pramehāḥ bhavanti sarve eva sarva doṣa samutthāḥ saha piḍakābhiḥ 	A copious flow of cloudy or turbid urine characterises all the types of the disease, which, together with the abscesses and eruptions (Pidaka) which mark its sequel, should be regarded as involving the concerted action of the deranged Doshas (Vayu, Pitta and Kaphah). 
doṣa dūṣyāṇām viṣama kriya tvāt 	Palliation is all that can be effected in these types, inasmuch as the medicines which tend to correct the deranged Pitta, which has brought on the disease, fail to exert similar virtues on the organic principles (Dushyas) deranged by it. 
mahātyayika tvāt 	These should be regarded as most incurable inasmuch as no kind of medicine can restore the fleet-coursing, deep diving (ie. 
tatra vāta pitta medobhiḥ anvitaḥ śleṣmā śleṣma pramehān janayati | 	The deranged Kaphah, in conjunction with the (morbid) Pitta, Vayu and fat, gives rise to all Kaphaja types of Prameha. 
kapha pitta vasā majja medobhiḥ anvitaḥ vāyuḥ vāta pramehān 	The deranged Pitta, in conjunction with the deranged Vayu, blood, fat and Kapha, produces the Pittaja ones; while the deranged Vayu, in unison with the deranged Kapha, Pitta, fat, marrow and Vasa (myosin), engenders the types of Vataja Prameha. 
śvetam avedanam udaka sadṛśam udaka mehī mehati 	The urine[3] of a person suffering from an attack of Udakameha becomes white and water-like and is passed without the least pain. In a case of Ikshumeha the urine resembles the expressed juice of sugarcane.

The urine in a case of Nilameha becomes frothy, transparent and bluish. The urine in a case of Haridrameha becomes deep yellow like turmeric (Haridra) and is passed with a burning pain. 
atas ūrdhvam vāta nimittān vakṣyāmaḥ sarpiḥ prakāśam sarpiḥ mehī mehati 	Now we shall describe the characteristics of the different types of Prameha, which are due to an exuberance of the deranged Vayu.

bhavati ca atra sarve eva pramehāḥ tu kālena a pratikurvataḥ madhumeha tvam āyānti tadā asādhyāḥ bhavanti hi 	All types of Prameha, not properly treated and attended to at the outset, may ultimately develop into those of Madhumeha types, which are incurable.

rakta jam vidradhim kuryāt kuksau makkalla saṃjñitam sapta ahāt na upaśāntaḥ ced tatas asau saṃprapacyate 	The unexpelled blood is called Makkalla, Such an abscess, if not absorbed in the course of a week, is sure to suppurate. 
viśeṣam atha vakṣyāmi spaṣṭam vidradhi gulmayoḥ 	Now I shall discuss the features which distinguish a Gulma (internal tumour) from a Vidradhi (internal abscess). 
kasmāt na pacyate gulmaḥ vidradhiḥ pākam eti ca 	It may be asked, how is it that Gulma, (internal tumour) though caused by, and involving the co-operation of the same deranged Doshas as an internal abscess, does nut suppurate, while the latter (Vidradhi) does run to suppuration? 22—23.. 
na nibandhaḥ asti gulmānām vidradhiḥ sa nibandhanaḥ gulma ākārāḥ svayam doṣāḥ vidradhiḥ māṃsa śoṇite 	The answer is that a Gulma (internal tumour), though caused by the same deranged Doshas as a Vidradhi (internal abscess), does not resort to any deranged organic matter, such as flesh, blood, etc., while, on the contrary, in a case of Vidradhi, the diseased flesh and blood of a locality are in themselves transformed into an abscess. 
vivara anucaraḥ granthiḥ apsu budbudakaḥ yathā 	An internal tumour (Gulma) is like a water bubble floating and moving about within a cavity of the body etc. 
evaṃprakāraḥ gulmaḥ tu tasmāt pākam na gacchati 	Hence, it is that a Gulma (internal tumour) does not suppurate at all. 
māṃsa śoṇita hīna tvāt gulmaḥ pākam na gacchati gulmaḥ tiṣṭhati doṣe sve vidradhiḥ māṃsa śoṇite 	Suppuration sets in in an abscess only because it largely contains flesh and blood unlike a Gulma (internal tumour) which is not formed of any such organic matter, and depends only on the aggravated Doshas giving birth to it. 
vidradhiḥ pacyate tasmāt gulmaḥ ca api na pacyate 	Hence, a Gulma does not suppurate at all. 
hṛd nābhi vasti jaḥ pakvaḥ varjyaḥ yaḥ ca tridoṣa jaḥ 	A case of an internal abscess suppurating about the heart, bladder or umbilicus as well as one of the Tridosha type (appearing in any part of the organism) should be given up as incurable. 
atha majja parīpākaḥ ghoraḥ samupajāyate 	The abscess in which the marrow suppurates (generally) becomes fatal. 
saḥ asthi māṃsa nirodhena dvāram na labhate yadā tatas sa vyādhinā tena jvalanena iva dahyate 	The suppurated marrow, failing to find an outlet on account of the compactness of the local flesh and bone, produces a sort of burning sensation in the locality which consumes the body like a blazing fire. 
asthi majja ūṣmaṇā tena śīryate dahyamāna vat vikāraḥ śalya bhūtaḥ ayam kleśayet āturam ciram 	The disease confined to the bone, like a piercing dirt, torments the patient for a considerable length of time. 
tatas medaḥ pramam snigdham śuklam śītam atho guru|| 	An incision (made into the affected bone) is followed by the secretion of a fat-like, glossy, white, cold and thick pus. 
bhinne asthni niḥsravet pūyam etat asthi gatam viduḥ vidradhim śāstra kuśalāḥ sarva doṣa rujā āvaham 	Men, learned in the knowledge of the Medicinal Shastras, designate such an abscess as an Asthighata-Vidradhi (abscess of the bone) which involves all the three kinds of deranged Doshas, and is attended with various kinds of pain which mark them respectively.

āhāra rasa yoni tvāt evam stanyam api striyāḥ tat eva apatya saṃsparśāt darśanāt smaraṇāt api 	As the strong and unclouded affections of a man are the cause of the emission of semen, so the fondest love of a mother for her children brings about the secretion of her breast-milk Both semen and breast-milk are the product of the essence of digested food, this essence being converted into milk in women.

raktena pitta uditaḥ ekaḥ eva kaiścid pradiṣṭaḥ mukhapāka sṛjñaḥ 	The blood-origined Raktaja type is nothing but a modification of the Pittaja one (giving rise to similar symptoms); it is also by others called Mukha-paka. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām nidāna sthāne mukharoganidānam nāma ṣoḍaśaḥ adhyāyaḥ||16|| suśuruta saṃhitā atha śārīra sthānam 	Thus ends the sixteenth Chapter of the Nidana Sthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of the Nidana of the diseases of the mouth. 
atha atas sarvabhūtacintāśārīram vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the Sharira which treats of the science of Being in general (Sarva-Bhuta  Chinta Sharira). 
sarva bhūtānām kāraṇam akāraṇam sattva rajaḥ tamaḥ lakṣaṇam aṣṭa rūpam akhilasya jagataḥ saṃbhava hetuḥ avyaktam nāma 	She is selfbegotten and connotes the three fundamental or primary virtues of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. She is imaged or embodied in the eightfold categories of and is the sole and primary factor in working out the evolution of the universe. 
tat ekam bahūnām kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānam samudraḥ iva audakānām bhāvānām 	The one absolute and original nature is the fundamental stone house of materials out of which the bodies of all self-conscious (Karma-Purusha) working agents (agents who come into being through the dynamical energy of their acts or Karmas) have been evolved in the same manner as all water, whether confined in a tank or a reservoir, or coursing free through the channels of streams and of mighty rivers, have been welled up from the one and shoreless primordial ocean. 
tasmāt avyaktāt mahān utpadyate tad liṅgaḥ eva 	Out of that latent unmanifest (Avyakta) or original nature (impregnated by the atoms or elemental units of consciousness or Purushas) Intellection or Mahan has been evolved, and out of Mahan egoism. 
sa trividhaḥ vaikārikaḥ taijasaḥ bhūta ādiḥ iti 	This Mahan or intellection should be likewise considered as partaking of the three fundamental attributes (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas) of the latent (Avyakta) or original nature.[1] Ahamkara or egoism in its turn may be grouped under three subheads as the Vaikarika Taijasa (operative) or Rajasika, and Bhutadi (illusive or Tamasika). 
tatra pūrvāṇi pañca buddhīndriyāṇi | itarāṇi pañca karmendriyāṇi | 	They are Of these foregoing organs the first five are intellectual or sense organs (Vuddhi-Indriya); the next five being operative (Karma-Indriya). 
ubhaya ātmakam manaḥ 	The mind (Manah) partakes of the character of both the intellectual and operative organs alike. 
tat yathā ---śabda tanmātram 	The five Tanmatras or elementals (or the five proper sensibles of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell) characterised by the Nescience, etc. 
gandha tanmātram iti 	The gross or perceptible modifications of these five Tanmatras are sound, touch, taste, sight and smell. 
buddhīndriyāṇām śabda ādayaḥ viṣayāḥ 	Hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell respectively form the subjects of the five intellectual (Vuddhi) organs of man, whereas the faculty of speech, handling, pleasure, ejections or evacutation, locomotion successively belong to the (remaining) five operative (Karma-Indriya) ones. 
avyaktam mahān ahaṅkāraḥ pañca tanmātrāṇi ca iti aṣṭau prakṛtayaḥ 	The original nature (Avyakta), Mahan[2] (intellection), Egoism (Ahamkara), the five sensibles (Tanmatras), and the five gross material principles in their nascent stage in evolution form what is included within the eight categories of Nature (Prakriti), the remaining sixteen categories being her modifications (Vikara). The objects of intellection (Mahan) and Egoism (Ahamkara) as well as of the sense organs of knowledge and actions are the material principles (Adibhautika) though they are spiritual in themselves and in their nature. The tutelary god of intellection (Buddhi) is Brahma. 
ahaṅkārasya īśvaraḥ 	The god Ishvara is the presiding deity of the sense of egoism (Ahamkara); 
manasaḥ candramāḥ | 	the moon god is that of the mind (Manah); 
diśaḥ śrotrasya | 	the quarters of the heaven, of the ears;

sūryaḥ cakṣuṣaḥ | 	the sun is that of the eyes;

pādayoḥ viṣṇuḥ | 	Vishnu is that of the legs; 
pāyoḥ mitraḥ | 	Mitra is that of the anus 
prajāpatiḥ upasthasya iti 	and Prajapati is that of the organs of generations. 
tatra sarvaḥ eva acetanaḥ eṣa vargaḥ | 	All the aforesaid (twenty-four) categories or elementals (Caturvinshati-Tanmatras) are devoid of consciousness. 
puruṣaḥ pañcaviṃśatitamaḥ kārya kāraṇa saṃyuktaḥ cetayitā bhavati 	The Purusha or the self-conscious subjectivity, enters into the primal cause (Mula-Prakriti or original Nature) and its necessary effect (the evolved out phenomena) and makes them endued with his own essence or self-consciousness. 
sati api acaitanye pradhānasya puruṣa kaivalya artham pravṛttim upadiśanti kṣīra ādīn ca atra hetūn udāharanti 	The preceptors and holy sages explain the proposition by an analogy that as the milk in the breast of a mother, though unconscious in itself, originates and flows out for the growth and sustenance of her child; (as the semen in the organism of an adult male though devoid of consciousness, flows out during an act of sexual intercourse); so these twenty-four primary material principles (elementals), though unconscious in themselves, tend to contribute towards the making of the self-conscious self or the universal individual (the aggregate of limited or conditional selves) for the purpose of working out his final liberation or emancipation i.e., attainment of the stage of pure consciousness or perfect knowledge. 
atas ūrdhvam prakṛti puruṣayoḥ sādharmya vaidharmye vyākhyāsyāmaḥ tat yathā -  ubhau api anādī | ubhau api anantau | 	Now we shall describe the tracts which the Purusha (subjective or self-conscious reality) and Prakriti or nature (passive non-conscious eternity) pass in common as well as those wherein they differ from each other. 
ubhau api nityau | ubhau api anaparau ubhau ca sarva gatau iti 	Both the Purusha and Prakriti are eternal realities, both of them are unmanifest, disembodied, without a beginning or origin, eternal, without a second, all—pervading and omnipresent. 
bahavaḥ tu puruṣāḥ cetanāvantaḥ aguṇāḥ a bīja dharmāṇaḥ a prasava dharmāṇaḥ madhyastha dharmāṇaḥ ca iti 	But the Purusha (units or atoms of consciousness), devoid of the threefold virtues of Sattva etc. 
tatra kāraṇa anurūpam kāryam iti kṛtvā sarve eva ete viśeṣāḥ sattva rajaḥ tamaḥ mayāḥ bhavanti 	In other words, these Mahat, Ahamkara, etc, are but the modifications of the three fundamental qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. 
vaidyake tu tu - - svabhāvam īśvaram kālam yaddacchām niyatim tathā pariṇāmam ca manyante prakṛtim pṛthu darśinaḥ 	It is asserted in the Ayurveda that it is only the gross-sighted ones and men capable of observing only the superficial appearances, who confound eternal order or sequence of things and events (Shvabhaba), God (Ishvara)[3] Time (Kala), sudden and unlooked for appearances of the phenomena (Yadriccha), Necessity (Niyati) and transformation (Parinama) with the original Nature (Prakriti). 
tad mayāni eva bhūtāni tad guṇāni eva ca ādiśet 	The five different forms of matter (such as Ether etc) are nothing but the modifications or transformed states of the original nature and are characterised by the three universal qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, and all created things, whether mobile or immobile, should be considered as alike exponented by the same. 
tasya upayogaḥ abhihitaḥ cikitsām prati sarvadā 	In the Science of medicine the cause of a disease is the one sole aim to be achieved by means of administering proper medicinal remedies (matter), and hence the properties of matter are the only fit subject to be dealt with in a book on pharmacy. 
yatas abhihitam - tad sambhava dravya samūhaḥ bhūta ādiḥ uktaḥ; bhautikāni ca indriyāṇi āyurvede varṇyante | 	And further, because the immediately prior cause of the human organism is a proper and congenial admixture of the sperm and ovum (matter), the sense organs are the resultants of phenomenal—evolution of matter, and the objects of sense perception are equally material or phenomenal in their nature. 
tathā indriya arthaḥ bhavati ca atra 	A man by a particular organ of his body perceives the same matter which forms the proper object of that sense organ in as much as the perceiving sense organ and the perceived sensible are produced by the same material cause. 
indriyeṇa indiya artham tu svam svam gṛhṇāti mānavaḥ 	The matter, which specifically forms the object of a particular sense organ, cannot be perceived by the other.

yatas abhihitam - pañca mahābhūta śarīri samavāyaḥ puruṣaḥ iti 	The view is further corroborated by a dictum of the Sruti which holds that Purusha (individual) is nothing but a combination of a self-conscious self and the five kinds of matter (Mahabhutas) formed into an organic body. 
tasya sukha duḥkhe icchā dveṣau prayatnaḥ prāṇa apānau unmeṣa nimeṣau buddhiḥ manaḥ saṅkalpaḥ vicāraṇā smṛtiḥ vijñānam adhyavasāyaḥ viṣaya upalabdhiḥ ca guṇāḥ 	Longing for pleasure, shunning of pain, enemity, energetic undertaking of work, respiration (Prana), emission of flatus (Apana), closing and opening of the eyelids, intellect (Vuddhi), sentiment (Manah), deliberation, discretion, memory, knowledge of art, perseverance, sensation and perception, are the attributes of an organic individual.

Feeling of much pain and misery, a roving spirit, noncomprehension, vanity, untruthfulness, nonclemency, pride, an over winning confidence in ones own excellence, lust, anger and hilarity are the attributes which mark a mind of the Rajashika cast. Despondency, stupidity, disbelief in the existence of God, impiety, stupification and perversity of intellect, lethargy in action and sleepiness are the qualities which mark a mind of a Tamashika stamp. 
sattva tamaḥ bahulāḥ āpaḥ | tamaḥ bahulā pṛthivī iti ślokau ca atra bhavataḥ 	Of these the ether or Akasa abounds in attributes of the Sattvika stamp, the Vayu or etherin (ether?) in Rajashika, the Teja in Sattvika and Rajashika, the water in Sattvika and Tamashika and the earth in Tamasha attributes. 
anyonya anupraviṣṭāni sarvāṇi etāni nirdiśet 	These qualities are found to characterise and enter into the successive elements in the order of their enumeration. 
sve sve dravye tu sarveṣām vyaktam lakṣaṇam iṣyate 	The specific attributes of these elements are manifest in the substances which are respectively originated from them. 
aṣṭau prakṛtayaḥ proktāḥ vikārāḥ ṣoḍaśa eva tu kṣetrajñaḥ ca samāsena svatantra paratantrayoḥ  | iti pā || 	The term Prakriti or original nature connotes the eight categories (of Avyakta, Mahan, Ahamkara, and the five Tanmatras) and the rest of the twenty four fundamental principles are its modifications.

nakha apakartanāt kunakhī pradhāvanāt cañcalaḥ | 	The woman who applies collyrium along her eyelids (during those days), gives birth to a blind child; by shedding tears (during her period) a woman gives birth to a child of defective eyesight; by bathing or smearing her body (with sandal paste etc.) a miserable one; by anointing her body a leper (Kushthi); by paring her nails a child with bad nails; by running a restless one; by indulging in excessive laughter, a child with brown (Syava) teeth or palate or tongue; by excessive talking a garrulous child or one of incoherent speech; by hearing loud sounds, a deaf child; by combing her hair, a bald one; whereas by exposure to the wind or by doing fatiguing work (during the first three days of her period) she gives birth to an insane child (conceived immediately after it).

The husband then having uttered the appropriate Veda Mantras and having awakened confidence in the wife, should go unto her on the fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth or on the twelfth night of her menses for the progenation of a male child. 
prajā saubhāgyam aiśvaryam balam ca divaseṣu vai 	A visit to the wife on any of these nights leads to the continual increase of the wealth, progeny, and the duration of the husband’s life.

tāni etāni pañca vikalpāni marmāṇi bhavanti 	Again these Marmas (vital unions of the body) are under five distinct heads, namely, Sadya-Pranahara, (fatal within twenty-four hours), Kalantara-Pranahara, (fatal within a fortnight or a month), Vishalyaghna (fatal as soon as a dart or any other imbedded foreign matter is extracted therefrom), Vaikalyakara, (maiming or deforming) and Rujakar (painful) [according as an injury respectively produces the aforesaid effects]. 
trīṇi viśalya ghnāni | catuścatvāriṃśat vaikalya karāṇi | 	Of these, nineteen Marmas belong to the Sadya-Pranahara group; thirty-three to the Kalantara-Pranahara group; three to the Vishalyaghna group; forty-four to the Vaikalyakara group; and eight to the Rujakara group. 
aṣṭau rujā karāṇi iti 	To the Sadya-Pranahara group (fatal in the course of a day if anyway hurt) belong the four Shringatakas, one Adhipati, the two Shankhas, the eight Kantha-Shiras, the Guda, the Hridaya, the Vasti and the Nabhi. 
vakṣaḥ marmāṇi sīmanta tala kṣipra indravastayaḥ 	To the KalantaraPranahara group (fatal later on, if any way hurt) belong the eight Vaksha-Marmas, the five Simantas, the four Tala-Marmas, the four Kshipra-Marmas, the four Indra-vastis, the two Katika-tarunas, the two Parshva-Sandhis, the two Vrihatis, and the two Nitamvas. 
nitambau iti ca etāni kāla antara harāṇi tu 	To the Vishalyaghna class belong the two Utkshepas and the one Sthapani. 
lohita akṣāṇi jānu urvī kūrca niṭapa kūrparāḥ kukundare kakṣadhare vidhure sa kṛkāṭike 	To the Vaikalyakara (deforming) group belong the Marmas, known as the four Lohitakshas, the four Anis, the two Janus, the four Urvis, the four Kurccas, the two Vitapas, the two Kurparas, the two Kukundaras, the two Kakshadharas, the two Vidhuras, the two Krikatikas, the two Ansas (shoulder), the two Ansa-phalakas, (shoulderblades), the two Apangas (tips of eyes), the two Nials (?), the two Manyas, the two Phanas and the two avartas.

kṣiprāṇi viddha mātrāṇi ghnanti kāla antareṇa ca 	A piercing of the Kshipra-Marma ends in an instantaneous death; or death may follow at a later time. 
marmāṇi nāma māṃsa sirā snāyu asthi sandhi sannipātāḥ 	Firm unions of Mansa (muscles), Shira (veins), Snayu (ligaments), bones or bone-joints are called Marmas (or vital parts of the body) which naturally and specifically form the seats of life (Prana), and hence a hurt to any one of the Marmas invariably produces such symptoms as arise from the hurt of a certain Marma.[2] 22. 
agni guṇeṣu āśu kṣīṇeṣu kṣapayanti 	The Marmas belonging to the Sadya-Pranahara group are possessed of fiery virtues (thermogenetic); as fiery virtues are easily enfeebled, so they prove fatal to life (in the event of being any way hurt); while those belonging to the Kalantara-Pranahara group are fiery and lunar (cool) in their properties. 
agni guṇeṣu āśu kṣīṇeṣu krameṇa ca soma guṇeṣu kāla antareṇa kṣapayanti 	And as the fiery virtues are enfeebled easily and the cooling virtues take a considerable time in being so, the Marmas of this group prove fatal in the long run (in the event of being any way hurt, if not instantaneously like the preceding ones). 
śalya mukha avaruddhaḥ yāvat antar vāyuḥ tiṣṭhati tāvat jīvati | uddhṛta mātre tu śalye marma sthāna āśritaḥ vāyuḥ niṣkrāmati | 	The Vishalyaghna Marmas are possessed of Vataja properties (that is, they arrest the escape of the vital Vayu); so long as the dart does not allow the Vayu to escape from their injured interior, the life prolongs; but as soon as the dart is extricated, the Vayu escapes from the inside of the hurt and necessarily proves fatal. 
tasmāt sa śalyaḥ jīvati uddhṛta śalyaḥ mriyate (*pākāt patita śalyaḥ vā jīvati 	The Vaikalyakaras are possessed of Saumya (lunar properties) and they retain the vital fluid owing to their steady and cooling virtues, and hence tend only to deform the organism in the event of their being hurt, instead of bringing on death. 
viśeṣataḥ ca tau rujā karau | 	The Rujakara Marmas of fiery and Vataja properties become extremely painful inasmuch as both of them are pain-generating in their properties. 
pāñcabhautikīm ca rujām āhuḥ eke 	Others, on the contrary, hold the pain to be the result of the properties of the five material components of the body (Panca-bhautika). 
kecid āhuḥ māṃsa ādīnām pañcānām api samastānām vivṛddhānām ca samavāyāt sadyaḥprāṇa harāṇi | eka hīnānām alpānām vā kāla antara prāṇa harāṇi | dvi hīnānām viśalya prāṇa harāṇi iti pā | 	Some assert that Marmas, which are the firm union of the five bodily factors (of veins, ligaments, muscles, bones and joints), belong to the first group (Sadya-Pranahara); that those, which form the junction of four such, or in which there is one in smaller quantity, will prove fatal in the long run, in the event of their being hurt or injured (Kalantara-Pranahara).[3] Those, which are the junction of three such factors, belong to the Vishalya-Pranahara[4] group; those of the two belong to the Vaikalyakara[5] group; and those in which only one of them exists belongs to the last or pain-generating type (Rujakara)[6]. 
na evam yatas asthi marmasu api abhihateṣu śoṇita āamanam bhavati 	But the fore going theory is not a sound one, inasmuch as blood is found to exude from an injured joint which would be an impossibility in the absence of any vein, ligament (Snayu) and muscle being intimately connected with it. 
caturvidhāḥ yāḥ tu sirāḥ śarīre prāyeṇa tāḥ marmasu sanniviṣṭāḥ snāyu asthi māṃsāni tathā eva sandhīn santarpya deham pratipālayanti pratipālayanti pratipālayanti pratipālayanti iti pā || tatas kṣte marmaṇi tāḥ pravṛddhaḥ samantataḥ vāyuḥ abhistṛṇoti 	This is further corroborated by the fact that the four classes of Shira or vessels (which respectively carry the Vayu, Pitta, Kapha and the blood) are found to enter into the Marmas for the purpose of keeping or maintaining the moisture of the local ligaments (Snayu), bones, muscles and joints and thus sustain the organism.[7] The Vayu, aggravated by an injury to a Marma, blocks up (those four classes of vessels) in their entire course throughout the organism and gives rise to great pain which extends all over the body. 
rujā abhibhūtam tu tatas śarīram pralīyate naśyati ca asya saṃjñā 	All the internal mechanism of a man (of which a Marma has been pierced into with a shaft or with any other piercing matter) becomes extremely painful, and seems as if it were being constantly shaken or jerked, and symptoms of syncope are found to set in. 
atas hi śalyam vinihartum icchan marmāṇi yatnena parīkṣya karṣet etena śeṣam vyākhyātam 	Hence a careful examination of the affected Marma should precede all the foregoing acts of extricating a Shalya from its inside. 
tatra sadyaḥprāṇa haram ante viddham kāla antareṇa mārayati | 	A Marma of the Sadyah-Pranahara type being perforated at its edge brings on death at a later time (within seven days), whereas a deformity of the organ follows from the piercing of a Kalantara-Maraka[8] Marma at the side (instead of in the centre). 
vaikalya karam kāla antaram kleśayati rujām ca karoti | 	And a Marma of the Rujakara[10] class produces an excruciating pain (instead of a sharp one) in the event of its being pierced at the fringe. 
tatra sadyaḥprāṇa harāṇi sapta rātra ābhyantarāt mārayati | kāla antara prāṇa harāṇi pakṣāt māsāt vā | 	An injured Marma of the Sadyah-Pranahara type terminates in death within seven days of the injury, while one of the Kalantara type, within a fortnight or a month from the date of hurt (according to circumstances). 
teṣu api kṣiprāṇi kadācid āśu mārayanti | 	A case of injured Kshipra-Marma seldom proves fatal before that time (seven days). 
viśalya prāṇa harāṇi vaikalya karāṇi ca kadācid ati abhihatāni mārayanti 	An injured Marma of the Vishalyaghna or Vaikalyakara group may prove fatal in the event of its being severely injured. 
uta ūrdhvam pratyekaśaḥ marma sthānāni vyākhyāsyāmaḥ -- tatra pādasya aṅguṣṭha aṅgulyoḥ madhye kṣipram iti marma nāma marma | 	Now we shall describe the situation of every Marma. The Marma, known as the Kshipra[11], is situated in the region between the first and the second toes (Tarsal articulation), which, being injured or pierced, brings on death from convulsions. The Marma, known as the Tala-Hridaya[12], is situated in the middle of the sole of the foot in a straight line drawn from the root of the middle toe. 
tatra viddhasya ākṣepakeṇa maraṇam 	An injury to this Marma gives rise to extreme pain which ends in death. 
tatra api rujābhiḥ maraṇam tatra pādasya bhramaṇa vepane bhavataḥ 	An injury to this Marma results in shivering and bending in of the foot. 
tatra rujā śophau; pāda jaṅghayoḥ sandhāne gulphaḥ nāma | 	The Marma called Kurcca-Shirah[14] is situated under the ankle-joints, one on each side of the foot (Gulpha-Sandhi); an injury to it gives rise to pain and swelling of the affected part. 
tatra rujaḥ stabdha pāda tā khañja tā vā 	A perforation of the Gulpha-Marma[15], which is situated at the junction of the foot and the calf, results in pain, paralysis and maimedness of the affected leg. 
tatra śoṇita kṣayeṇa maraṇam 	An injury to the Marma which is. 
tatra khañja tā; ūrdhvam ubhayatas tri aṅgula māṇī nāma | 	A piercing of the Ani-Marma,[18] situated on both the sides above three fingers’ width from the Janu (knee joint), brings on swelling and paralysis (numbness) of the leg. 
tatra śopha abhivṛddhiḥ stabdha sakthi tā ca tatra śoṇita kṣayāt sakthi śoṣaḥ; ūrvyāḥ ūrdhvam adhas vaṅkṣaṇa saṃdheḥ lohitākṣam nāma | 	An injury to the Lohitaksha-Marma,[20] situated respectively a little above and below the Urvi-Marma and the Vankshana (groin-joint), and placed near the thigh, is attended with excessive hemorrhage and causes paralysis (of the leg). 
tatra lohita kṣayeṇa maraṇam pakṣāghātaḥ vā iti pā pakṣāghātaḥ sakthi śoṣaḥ vā 	An injury to the Vitapa-Marma,[21] situated between the Scrotum and the Vankshana (inguinal region), brings on loss of manhood or scantiness of semen. 
etena itara sakthi bāhū ca vyākhyātau 	Thus the eleven Sakthi-Marmas of one leg have been described; those in the other being of an identical nature with the preceding ones. 
viśeṣataḥ tu yāni sakthni gulpha jānu viṭapāni tāni bāhau maṇi bavdha kūrpara kakṣadharāṇi 	The Marmas in the hands are almost identical with those of the legs, with the exception that Manivandha, Kurpara and Kakshadhara Marmas occur in the place of the Gulpha, Janu and Vitapa Marmas respectively.

tasmāt tayoḥ abhihatasya tu pāṇi pādam chettavyam āśu maṇibandhana gulpha deśe 	Hence, in a case of piercing or of injury to any of these Marmas, the hand or the leg should be immediately amputated at the wrist or at the ankle (respectively). 
marmāṇi śalya viṣaya ardham udāharanti yasmāt ca marmasu hatāḥ na bhavanti sadyas|| 	The medical authorities have described the Marmas to have covered half in the scope of Shalya Tantra (Surgery), inasmuch as a person hurt in any of the Marmas dies presently (i. e., within seven days of the hurt).

rujā karāṇi marmāṇi kṣatāni vividhāḥ rujaḥ kurvanti ante ca vaikalyam ku vaidya vaśa gaḥ yadi 	An injury to any of the Rujakara Marmas gives rise to various kinds of pain in the affected organ, which may ultimately bring about a deformity of the same, if placed under the treatment of an ignorant and unskillful Vaidya (Surgeon).

marmāṇi adhiṣṭhāya hi ye vikārāḥ mūrcchanti kāye vividhāḥ narāṇām 	The diseases which are seated in the Marmas, are generally serious, but they may be made to prove amenable with the greatest care and difficulty.

saptamaḥ adhyāyaḥ atha atas sirāvarṇavibhaktim nāma śārīram vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the Sharira which treats of the description and classification of Sira or vascular system[1] (Sira-Varnana-Vibhaktinama Sharira). 
sapta sirā śatāni bhavanti 	There are seven hundred Siras (vessels) in the human organism (except those which cannot be counted for their extremely attenuated size).

yāvatyaḥ tu sirāḥ kāye saṃbhavanti śarīriṇām 	All the Siras (vessels) that are found in the organisms of created beings, originate from the umbilical region (Nabhi)[2] and thence they spread all over their bodies. 
nābhi sthāḥ prāṇinām prāṇāḥ prāṇān nābhiḥ vyupāśritā 	The life of an organic animal is seated in the vessels surrounding its navel which forms their starting point. 
sirābhiḥ āvṛtā nābhiḥ cakra nābhiḥ iva arakaiḥ 	The navel in its turn rests on or is attached to the Pranas (the life-carrying vessels—nerves attached to it) in the same  manner as the nave of a wheel supports the spokes, and the spokes in their turn support the nave. 
tāsām mūlasirāḥ catvāriṃśat pitta vāhinyaḥ daśa kapha vāhinyaḥ daśa 	Of these Siras (vessels), forty are principal ones, of which ten are Vayu-carrying Siras (nerves), ten are Pitta-carrying Siras (veins), ten convey Kapha (lymphatic vessels?) and ten are bloodcarrying Siras (arteries). 
tāsām tu vāta vāhinīnām vāta sthāna gatānām pañcasaptati śatam bhavati | 	Of these the Vayu-carrying Siras, situated in the specific receptacle of that bodily principle (Vata), are again found to branch out in one hundred and seventy five smaller branches (ramifications). 
kapha vāhinyaḥ ca kapha sthāne | rakta vāhinyaḥ ca yakṛt plīhnoḥ | evam etāni sapta sirā śatāni 	Similarly, each of the remaining Pitta-carrying, Kaphacarrying and blood-carrying vessels (Siras) situated in their specific receptacles, (i.e.), in the receptacles of Pitta, Kapha and spleen and liver respectively) are found to branch out in as many numbers (one hundred and seventy-five),—thus making a total of seven hundred in all. 
tatra vāta vāhinyaḥ sirāḥ ekasmin sakthni pañcaviṃśatiḥ | etena itara sakthi bāhū ca vyākhyātau 	There are twenty-five Vayu-carrying Siras (nerves) in one leg and the same count applies to the other. 
viśeṣataḥ tu koṣṭhe caturstriṃśat; tāsām guda meḍhra āśritāḥ śroṇyām aṣṭau | dve dve pārśvayoḥ | ṣaṭ pṛṣṭhe | 	There are thirty-four Vayu-carrying vessels in the Koshtha (trunk); of these eight occur in the pelvic regions attached with the anus and the penis; two in each of the sides, six in the back, six in the Udara (cavity of the abdomen), and ten in the region of the chest. 
ekacatvāriṃśat jatruṇaḥ ūrdhvam | 	There are forty-one Vayu-carrying Sira’s (vessels) situated in the region above the clavicles.

aṣṭau netrayoḥ | evam etat pañca saptati śatam vāta vahānām sirāṇām vyākhyātam bhavati 	Thus we have finished the description of the one hundred and seventy-five Siras that carry Vayu. 
viśeṣataḥ tu pitta vāhinyaḥ netrayoḥ daśa | 	What has been said of these Vayu-carrying vessels (Siras) will also hold good to the rest (in blood-carrying), Pitta-carrying and Kapha-carrying channels in the respective regions of the body), with the exception that in these three cases, (Pitta, Kapha and blood) ten occur in the eyes and two in the ears in lieu of eight and four respectively, as in the case of Vayu-carrying Siras (vessels). 
evam etāni sapta sirā śatāni sa vibhāgāni vyākhyātāni bhavanti ca atra | 	Thus we have described the seven hundred Siras with their branches. 
karoti anyān guṇān ca api sirāḥ pavanaḥ caran yadā tu kupitaḥ vāyuḥ svāḥ sirāḥ pratipadyate tadā asya vividhāḥ rogāḥ jāyante vāta saṃbhavāḥ 	The Vayu-carrying Siras:—The Vayu in its normal state and coursing through its specific Siras (vessels) helps the unobstructed performance of its specific functions viz., expansion, contraction, speech, etc., and produces the clearness and non-illusiveness of Buddhi (intellect) and the senseorgans, whereas a coursing of the said Vayu in a deranged condition through the aforesaid Siras (vessels), gives rise to a host of such diseases as are due to the derangement of Vayu. 
saṃsarpat svāḥ sirāḥ pittam kuryāt ca anyān guṇūn api yadā prakutitam pittam sevate sva vahāḥ sirāḥ tadā asya vividhāḥ rogāḥ jāyante pitta saṃbhavāḥ 	The Pitta in its normal state and coursing through its specific Siras (vessels) produces the healthy glow of complexion, relish for food, kindling of the appetite, healthfulness and other good effects, characteristic of the Pitta, which however being aggravated and coursing through them gives rise to a host of Pittaja diseases. 
karoti anyān guṇān ca api balāsaḥ svāḥ sirāḥ caran yadā tu kupitaḥ śleṣmā svāḥ sirāḥ pratipadyate tadā asya vividhāḥ rogāḥ jāyante śleṣma saṃbhavāḥ 	The Kapha in its normal state and coursing through its specific Siras (vessels) smoothes and contributes to the firmness of the limbs and joints, improves the strength and produces all other good effects specially belonging to it, whereas the same Kapha, flowing through them in an aggravated condition, ushers in a large number of the Kaphaja distempers of the body. 
svāḥ sirāḥ saṃcarat raktam kuryāt ca anyān guṇān api 	The blood in its normal state and flowing through its specific Siras (vessels) strengthens the other fundamental principles (Dhatus) of the body, improves the complexion, aids the organ of touch in the proper performance of its functions and produces other functions characteristic of it in the body. 
tadā asya vividhāḥ rogāḥ jāyante rakta saṃbhavāḥ 	Flowing through them in a vitiated condition, it begets diseases which are due to the derangement of the blood. 
na hi vātam sirāḥ kāścid na pittam kevalam tathā|| 	There is not a single Sira (vessel) in the body which carries either the Vayu, or the Pitta or the Kapha alone. 
śleṣmāṇām vā vahanti etāḥ atas sarva vahāḥ smṛtāḥ praduṣṭānām hi doṣāṇām ucchritānām mūrchitānām pradhāvatām 	Hence each of the vessels should be regarded as affording an opportunity for conveying all kinds of the Doshas of the body, for as soon as they are deranged and aggravated they seem to flow through all the Siras promiscuously. 
dhruvam unmāra ga gamanam atas sarva vahāḥ smṛtāḥ 	Hence they are called Sarvavahah. 
tatra aruṇāḥ vāta vahāḥ pūryante vāyunā sirāḥ 	The vessels which carry the bodily Vayu (nerves) have a vermilion (yellowish red) hue and seem to be stuffed with Vayu.

catuḥṣaṣṭi sirā śatam jatruṇaḥ ūrdhvam bhavati 	There are one hundred and sixty-four Siras in the region above the clavicles. 
tāsām aṣṭau catasraḥ ca marma saṃjñāḥ pariharet | 	Of these the eight and four (making twelve and respectively known as the eight Matrikas, the two Nilas and the two Manyas) out of the fifty-six in the neck and the throat, should be regarded as unfit for opening.

atha atas dhamanīvyākaraṇam śārīram vyākhyāsyāmaḥ 	Now we shall discourse on the Sharira which treats of the description of the arteries, nerves and ducts, etc.[1] (Dhamani-Vyakarana-Sharira). 
caturviṃśatiḥ dhamanyaḥ nābhi prabhavāḥ abhihitāḥ 	There are twenty-four Dhamanies (ducts) in all, and all of them have their origins in the naval region (which includes the whole abdominal region[2]). 
tatra kecid āhuḥ sirā dhamanī srotasām avibhāgaḥ sirā vikārāḥ eva hi dhamanyaḥ srotāṃsi ca iti tat tu na samyak 	Several authorities assert that no arbitrary distinctions should be made among the Shiras (veins), Dhamanis (arteries), and the Srotas, (channels), since Dhamanis and Srotas are but different modifications of one original kind of Sira (vessels). 
anyāḥ eva hi dhamanyaḥ srotāṃsi ca sirābhyaḥ 	But this opinion is not a sound one inasmuch as they have got different natures, origins and functions and as being described so in the Ayurveda. 
daśa ca adhas gāminyaḥ | catasraḥ tiryaggāḥ 	Of the twenty-four Dhamanis, which (originally) have their roots in the naval region (Nabhi), ten have upward course, ten have downward course, and four flow laterally or transversely. 
ūrdhva gāḥ śabda sparśa rūpa rasa gandha praśvāsa ucchvāsa jṛmbhita kṣudh hasita kathita rudita ādīn viśeṣān abhivahantyaḥ śarīram dhārayanti 	The ten up-coursing Dhamanis (nerves) perform such specific functions of the body, as sound, touch, taste, sight, smell, inspiration, sighing, yawning, sneezing, laughter, speech, and weeping, etc., and tend to maintain the integrity of the body. 
tāḥ triṃśat 	These Dhamanis, reaching the heart, respectively ramify themselves into three branches, thus making thirty (ramifications in all). 
tāsām tu vāta pitta kapha śoṇita rasān dve dve vahataḥ tāḥ daśa | 	Ten of these serve the following purposes, viz, two serve as the channels of the bodily Vayu, two of the Pitta, two of the Kapha, two of the blood, and two of the Rasa (lymph chyle). 
śabda rūpa rasa gandhān aṣṭābhiḥ gṛhṇīte | dvābhyām bhāṣate | 	Eight of the remaining ones (twenty), serve the following functions, viz., two of them cany sound, two sight or colour, two smell, and two taste. 
dvābhyām pratibudhyate | 	Moreover a man speaks with the help of another two, makes sound with the help of another couple, sleeps through the instrumentality of another pair (couple), and wakes up with the help of another couple. 
dve ca aśruvāhiṇyau | dve stanyam striyā vahataḥ stana saṃśrite | te eva śukram narasya stanābhyām abhivahataḥ | 	Two of the Dhamanis (ducts) carry the fluid of lachrymation, two of them (ducts), attached to the breasts of a woman, carry milk of her breasts, which, coursing through the breast of a man, convey his seminal fluid. 
tāḥ tu etāḥ triṃśat savibhāgāḥ vyākhyātāḥ 	Thus we have described the thirty Dhamanis with their ramifications. 
etābhiḥ ūrdhvam nābheḥ udara pārśva pṛṣṭha uraḥ skandha grīvā bāhavaḥ dhāryante yāpyante ca || 	These sustain and maintain the integrity (of the limbs and members of the body) above the (line of) umbilicus, such as the Udara, the sides, the back, the chest, the neck, the shoulders and the arms. 
ūrdhvaṃgamāḥ tu kurvanti karmāṇi etāni sarvaśas 	The up-coursing Dhamanis duly perform the offices stated above. 
adhas gamāḥ tu vakṣyāmi karma tāsām yathāyatham  | yathāyatham iti pā || 	Now I shall describe the specific functions, etc., (i.e., nature, office, and situations, etc.,) of the down-coursing ones. 
adhas gamāḥ tu vāta mūtra purīṣa śukra ārtava ādīni adhas vahanti 	The down-coursing Dhamanis respectively form the channels for the downward conveyance of Vayu (flatus), urine, stool, semen, and catamenial fluid, etc. 
tāḥ tu pittāśayam abhiprapannāḥ tatrastham eva anna pāna rasam vipakvam auṣṇyāt vive(recayantyaḥ abhivahantyaḥ śarīram tarpayanti | arpayanti ca ūrdhva gānām tiryak gatānām ca | 	These Dhamanis reaching down into the Pittashaya (receptacle of the Pitta) separate the serum prepared out of the food and drink through the agency of the local heat (and pitta), and carry it to the remotest parts of the organism maintaining their healthy moisture, supplying them with the necessary principles of nutrition and (ultimately) conveying them to the upcoursing and lateral Dhamanis, in order to be conveyed to the parts traversed by them respectively. 
rasa sthānam ca abhipūrayanti | 	Thus they indirectly serve to supply the heart with its quota of healthy Rasa (serus fluid), if not in a direct way. 
mūtra purīṣa svedān ca vivecayanti 	Moreover they tend to separate the effetematter (urine, stool and sweat) from the fully transformed lymph-chyle in the abdomen, the stomach and the small intestines (Amashaya and Pakvashaya).

tat hi kuṣṭha vat uttānam bhūtvā kāla antareṇa avagāḍhībhavati | 	But such a classification is arbitrary and unscientific, inasmuch as this disease first manifests itself on the surface (layer of the skin) like Kushtha and gradually invades the deeper tissues of the body. 
tasmāt na dvividham 	Hence there are no (two) forms of this disease. 
tatra balavat vigraha ādibhiḥ prakupitasya vāyoḥ guru uṣṇa adhyaśana śīlasya praduṣṭam śoṇitam mārgam āvṛtya vātena saha ekībhūtam yugapad vātarakta nimittām vedanām janayati iti vātaraktam 	The Vayu of the body is enraged or agitated by such causes as wrestling with a man of superior and uncommon physical strength, etc., while the blood is vitiated by such causes as constant over-eating of edibles which are of difficult digestion and heat-making in their potency or ingestion of food before the digestion of the previous meal. The Vayu thus enraged and agitated enters into the bloodcarrying channels of the body and being obstructed in its passage, becomes mixed with the vitiated blood. The deranged Vayu and the blood thus combine to give rise to a disease characterised by the specific symptoms of each, which is known as Vata-Rakta. 
tat tu pūrvam hasta pādayoḥ avasthānam kṛtvā paścāt deham vyāpnoti 	The characteristic pain, which at first confines itself to the extremities, gradually extends over the whole body.

uddhṛta śalyam tu uṣṇa udaka droṇyām avagāhya svedayet | 	After the extraction of a stone, the patient should be made to sit in a Droni (cauldron) full of warm water and be fomented thereby.

vasti guda viddha lakṣaṇam prāk uktam iti|| bhavati ca atra 	The symptoms which characterise a hurt to the rectum or to the bladder have been described before.

atha atas mūḍhagarbhacikitsitam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the (surgical and medical) treatment of the cases of difficult malpresentation of the fetus and of difficult labour (Mudha-Garbha). 
na atas anyat kaṣṭatamam asti yathā mūḍha garbha śalya uddharaṇam 	The extraction of a fetus, acting (in the womb) as an obstructing Shalya (foreign matter lodged in the body), is the most difficult of all surgical operations, inasmuch as actual contact or actual manipulation is the only means accessible to a surgeon in the region of the pelvic cavity, the spleen, the liver, the intestines and the uterus. 
utkarṣaṇa apakarṣaṇa sthāna apavartana utkartana bhedana chedana pīḍana ṛjūkaraṇa dāraṇāni ca eka hastena garbham garbhiṇīm ca a hiṃsatā | 	All surgical acts in respect of the fetus or the enceinte, such as lifting up, drawing down, changing of postures (version), excision, incision, the cutting of limbs and section, pressure, the straightening and the perforating of the abdomen, could not be done otherwise than by actual contact of the hand, which may sometimes prove fatal to the fetus or to the enciente. 
tasmāt adhipatim āpṛcchya param ca yatnam āsthāya upakrameta 	Hence the king should be first informed (as success in these cases is often uncertain) and all acts should be performed with the greatest care and coolness. 
tatra samāsena aṣṭavidhā mūḍha garbha gatiḥ uddiṣṭā 	We have stated before that the fetus is generally presented in cases of difficult labour in eight different postures or forms.

nirhartum aśakye cyāvanān mantrān upaśṛṇuyāt 	The sacred verses (Mantras), possessing of the virtue of bringing out the fetus, should be recited in the hearing of the enciente in the case of a failure in the first attempts at effecting parturition.

mṛte ca uttānāyāḥ ābhugna sakthyāḥ vastrādhāraka unnamita kaṭhyā dhanvana nagavṛttikā śālmalī mṛtsna ghṛtābhyām mrakṣayitvā hastam yonau praveśya garbham upaharet 	In the case of the fetus being dead in the womb, the enciente should be made to lie on her back with her thighs flexed down and with a pillow of rags under her waist so as to keep it a little elevated. Then the physician should lubricate his (own) hand with a compound consisting of earth, clarified butter and (the compressed juice of) Shallaki, Dhanvana and Shalmali and inserting it into the passage of parturition (Yoni) should draw out the dead fetus (downward with the hand). 
tatra sakthibhyām āgatam anulomam eva āñchet | 	In the case of a leg-presentation (Sakthi), the fetus should be drawn downward by pulling its legs. 
eka sakthnā pratipannasya itara sakthi prasārya apaharet | 	In case where a single leg (Sakthi) is presented, the other leg of the fetus should be expanded and then it should be drawn downward.

pārśva apavṛtta śirasam aṃsam prapīḍya ūrdhvam utkṣipya śiraḥ apatya patham ānīya apaharet | 	In a case of the head being hung back a little on one side, the shoulder should be lifted up by pressing it (with the hand) after chafening it, so as to bring the head at the door of the passage and the child should be drawn straight downward. 
bāhu dvaya pratipannasya ūrdhvam utpīḍya aṃsau śiraḥ anulomam ānīya apaharet | 	Similarly in the case of the presentation of the two arms, the shoulder should be lifted up by pressing it (with the hand) and, the head being brought back to the passage, the child should be drawn downward. 
dvau antyau asādhyau mūḍha garbhau | 	The remaining two kinds of false presentation (Mudhagarbha) previously described (in the eighth Chapter of the Nidana Sthana) should be considered as irremediable. 
evam aśakye śastram avacārayet 	The applications of instruments (Sastra) should be the last resort when such manipulatory measures would fail. 
dāryamāṇaḥ hi jananīm ātmānam ca eva ghātayet 	But even in such irremediable (Asadhya) cases, surgical operations should not be made if the fetus could be detected alive in the womb, as such a course (as the cutting of the fetus, etc.) would fatally end both as regards the child and its mother. 
aviṣahye vikāre tu śreyaḥ garbhasya pātanam 	In cases where there would be any necessity of using an instrument for the purpose of delivery, the enciente should be encouraged (with hopes of life) before making the surgical operation. 
tatas striyam āśvāsya maṇḍala agreṇa aṅgulī śastreṇa vā śiraḥ vidārya | 	The head or skull of the child in such cases should be severed with the knife known as the Mandlalagra or the Anguli-shastra; then having carefully taken out the particles of the skull-bone (Kapala), the fetus should be drawn out by pulling it at its chest or at the shoulder with a Sanku (forceps). 
śaṅkunā gṛhītvā urasi kakṣāyām vā apaharet 	Where the head would not be punctured and smashed, the fetus should be drawn out by pulling it at the cheeks or the eye-sockets.

dṛtim iva ātatam vāta pūrṇa udaram vā vidārya nirasya antrāṇi śithilībhūtam āharet | 	The abdomen of a child, dead in the womb, should be pierced and the intestines drawn out, in event of the former being swollen into a flatulent (Vata) distension like a leather bag (for holding water), as such a procedure would remove the stiffness of its limbs, and then it should be drawn out. 
yat yat aṅgam hi garbhasya tasya sajjati tat bhiṣaj 	The bones of the thighs (Jaghana-kapala) should be first cut out and removed, where the fetus would be found to have adhered fast to the passage with its thighs (Jaghana). 
samyak vinirharet chittvā rakṣet nārīm ca yatnataḥ 	In short, that part of the body of the fetus should be severed and removed which prevents its (fetus) withdrawal from the womb and the life of the mother should be saved at all hazards. 
garbhasya gatayaḥ citrāḥ jāyante anila kopataḥ tatra analpa matiḥ vaidyaḥ varteta vidhi pūrvakam 	The different types of false-presentations should be ascribed to the abnormal coursing of the deranged Vayu (in the uterus), and hence an intelligent physician should adopt, after careful considerations, proper remedies (for its pacification). 
na upekṣeta mṛtam garbham muhūrtam api paṇḍitaḥ sa hi āśu jananīm hanti nirucchvāsam paśum yathā 	An intelligent physician should not waste a single moment in drawing out the fetus, as soon as it would be found to be dead in the womb, since neglect in such cases leads to the instantaneous death of the mother, like an animal dying of suffocation. 
maṇḍala agreṇa kartavyam chedyam antar vijānatā vṛddhi patram hi tīkṣṇa agram nārīm hiṃsyāt kadācana 	An erudite physician, well-versed in anatomy, should use in such cases a Mandalagra instrument for the purpose of cutting out (the fetus), since a sharpe-edged Vriddhi-patra may sometimes hurt the mother during the operation.

This is the rule of preparing drug-decoctions (Kashaya). 
etat tu na samyak kasmāt āgama asiddha tvāt 	But this is not correct. Why? Because it is not in conformity with the injunctions of the Scriptures (officinal standard).

They should then be boiled over a fire and the decoction should be taken down from the oven with only a quarter part of the water left. This is the general rule for preparing a decoction (Kashaya). 
snehāt catur bhāga avaśiṣṭam kvāthayitvā apaharet iti eṣa kaṣāya pāka kalpaḥ snehāt caturguṇaḥ dravaḥ sneha caturtha ṃśaḥ bheṣaja kalkaḥ bheṣaja kalkaḥ 	One part of the Sneha (oil, clarified butter, etc.), four parts of (any one or more) liquid[5] substances, a fourth part of the medicinal pastes (Kalka) should be boiled together. 
tad aikadhyam saṃṛjya vipacet iti eṣa sneha pāka kalpaḥ 	This is the general rule for the preparation of a medicated Sneha (oil, clarified butter, etc.).

tatra ayam vidhiḥ āstheyaḥ nirdiṣṭe tadvat eva tu 	The foregoing rules should be adopted where no measures would be found to have been specifically given of the Sneha, the liquid and of the drugs, whereas in cases of specification, the specific quantities should be taken. 
anukte drava kārye tu sarvatra salilam matam 	Water should be used as the liquid, where no other liquid would be mentioned by name (in connection with medicating a Sneha, viz., oil, clarified butter, etc, by cooking). 
kalka kvāthau anirdeśe gaṇāt tasmāt prayojayet 	Both for the decoction and paste (Kalka\ the drugs mentioned in the respective list should be used in preparing a medicated Sneha in the absence of any explicit and specific injunction to that effect.

sa tu trividhaḥ madhyamaḥ | kharaḥ iti 	Mild (Mridu), middling or intermediate (Madhyama) and hard (Khara) are the three degrees which the boiling process undergoes in medically cooking a Sneha. 
madhūcchiṣṭam iva viśadam avilepi yatra bheṣajam sa madhyamaḥ | 	A cooking is said to be mild (Mridu-Paka) when the oil is found to drop off entirely from its drug-paste (Kalka) leaving it dry and sapless; whereas in an act of middle-cooking (MadhyamaPaka) the paste would be found to have become pellucid and non-sticky like wax; a cooking done until the paste (in the Sneha) assumes a little clear, glossy, frothless, black colour is termed strong (KharaPaka). 
kṛṣṇam avasannam īṣat viśadam cikkaṇam ca yatra bheṣajam sa kharaḥ iti 	A Sneha cooked beyond the last-named degree is called a burnt Sneha.

nasya abhyaṅgayoḥ madhyamaḥ | vasti karṇapūraṇayoḥ tu kharaḥ iti 	A middling-cooked one for the purposes of errhines and anointments, while a strongly cooked one should be used for the purposes of Vasti-Karma and as ear-drops[6] 16.

A man with an empty stomach should be made to take a draught of a medicinal or medicated oil or Ghrita, just as the god of day (sun) would appear on the summit of the hill at dawn and lighten up the horizon with the first shoots of his vermiliontinted golden rays.

accham eva pibet sneham accha pānam hi pūjitam 	A Sneha should be taken in the morning (lit. 
śīta kāle divā sneham uṣṇa kāle pibet niśi 	day-time) during the cold months of the year and in case of the joint aggravation of the bodily Vayu and Kapha; whereas it should be taken in the evening (lit.

gadāḥ vā kṛcchra tām yānti na sidhyanti athavā punar 	The internal use of a Sneha (oil or Ghrita) gives rise to a host of maladies in the foregoing cases, or the diseases become more serious or may even become incurable. 
garbhāśaye avaśeṣāḥ syuḥ rakta kleda malāḥ tatas 	In cases of premature parturition, there remains a quantity of mucus and vitiated lochia in the womb; therefore, stomachic (Pacana) and parching (Ruksha) drugs should be administered to females after child-birth.

su snigdhā tvac viṣ śaithilyam dīptaḥ agniḥ mṛdu gātra tā 	A dry or parched condition of the organism should be inferred from a general dryness of the body, the hard and knotty character of the fecal matter (stools), a sluggish digestion with a burning sensation on the epigastrium (Uras) and an upward coursing of the Vayu from the abdomen (Koshtha) as well as from the weakness and discoloration of the body. 
bhakta dveṣaḥ mukhasrāvaḥ guda dāhaḥ pravāhikā purīṣa atipravṛttiḥ ca bhṛśa snigdhasya lakṣaṇam 	Lassitude, a sense of heaviness in the limbs, the oozing out of the Sneha through the lower orifices of the body and an aversion to any kind of oleaginous substance are the indications which mark the satisfactory action of an emulsive remedy in a human organism, while its abrupt excess or abuse is followed by aversion to food, salivation, a burning sensation about the anus, dysentery and diarrhea and such like symptoms. 
śyāmāka koradūṣa anna takra piṇyāka śaktubhiḥ 	A condition of dryness in the organism should be remedied with a Sneha, while an excess of the latter should be corrected with meals of Shyamaka or Koradusha grains, as well as with milk-curd (Takra), levigated sesamum paste (Pinyaka) and powdered barley (Shaktu).

snehaḥ hitaḥ durbala hni deha sandhukṣaṇe vyādhi nipīḍitasya bala anvitau bhojana doṣa jātaiḥ pramarditum tau sahasā na sādhyau 	The application of a Sneha is potent enough to increase the strength and the digestive capacity of a weak person suffering from impaired digestion, and a person having his health and digestive capacity recouped (by the use of a Sneha) does not yield to the evil effects of errors of diet. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām cikitsā sthāne snehopayaugikacikitsitam nāma ekatriṃśattamaḥ adhyāyaḥ||31|| 	Thus ends the Thirty-first Chapter in the Chikitsita Sthana of the Sushruta Samhita which deals with the treatment of the diseases where oleaginous medicines are useful. 
atha atas svedāvacāraṇīyam cikitsitam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the medical treatment by measures of fomentations, diaphoretic measures, etc. (Sveda-vacaranìya). 
caturvidhaḥ svedaḥ tat yathā tāpasveda | ūṣma sveda | upanāha svedaḥ | 	Sveda[1] (calorification, fomentation, diaphoretic measures, etc.) may be divided into four groups such as, the application of direct heat (Tapa-sveda), fomentation (Ushma-sveda), poulticing (Upanaha sveda) and the application of heated fluids (Drava-sveda). 
dravasvedaḥ iti atra sarva sveda vikalpa avarodhaḥ 	All kinds of diaphoretic measures (Sveda) belong to one or the other of these groups.

māṃsa rasa payaḥ dadhi sneha dhānyāmla vāta hara pattrabhaṅga kvātha pūrṇām vā kumbhīm anutaptām prāvṛtya ūṣmāṇam gṛhṇīyāt 	As an alternative, a metal saucer containing milk, curd, Dhanyamla, meatsoup and a decoction of the tender leaves of the Vayusubduing plants (jointly or separately) should be heated over a fire. 
pārśva chidreṇa vā kumbhena adhomukhena tasyāḥ mukham abhisandhāya tasmin chidre hasti śuṇḍa ākārām nāḍīm praṇidhāya tam svedayet 	The mouth of the saucer should be covered (with a piece of blanket or such other cloth)[3] and the affected part of the body should be fomented with the vapours rising therefrom. As an alternative, another pitcher should be placed with its mouth downward over the mouth of the above pitcher (containing the abovenamed heated articles). Then an aperture should be made in the side of the upper pitcher and a pipe to the shape of an elephant’s trunk should be inserted into it. 
sukha upaviṣṭam su abhyaktam guru prāvaraṇa āvṛtam 	He should then be made to sit in an easy posture. 
hastiśuṇḍikayā nāḍyā svedayet vāta rogiṇam 	Heat should then be applied through a pipe shaped as an elephant’s trunk. 
sukhā sarva aṅga gā hi eṣā na ca kliśnāti mānavam 	The advantage of this mode of fomentation is that the entire body of the patient may be easily fomented without causing him any serious trouble. 
vyāma ardha mātrā tris vakrā hasti hasta sama ākṛtiḥ svedana arthe hitā nāḍī kailiñjī hastiśuṇḍikā|| 	The pipe should be made half a Vyama[4] in length with three bends or turns[5] in its body to resemble the trunk of an elephant.[6] The use of a pipe made of the materials (such as Kusha, Kasha, etc.) used in the making of a Kilinji (basket) and resembling the trunk of an elephant in shape is only recommended for the purposes of Sveda (heat-application). 
kāṣṭhaiḥ dagdhvā tathā abhyukṣya kṣīra dhānyāmla vāribhiḥ 	A plot of ground commensurate with the length of the patient’s body should be dug and heated with fire of Khadira wood and then sprinkled over with milk, water and Dhanyamla. 
patrabhaṅgaiḥ avacchādya śayānam svedayet tatas 	The heated ground should be then covered with a layer of leaves (of the Vayu-subduing plants) and the patient should be made to lie down full stretched upon the (bed of) leaves and thereby fomented.[7] As an alternative, a stone slab should be heated and the fomentation (Sveda) should be applied similarly to the patient by making him lie down upon it after the ashes and cinders have been removed[8]. 
pūrvavat svedayet dagdhvā bhasma apohya api vā śilām pūrvavat kuṭīm vā catur dvārām kṛtvā tasyām upaviṣṭasya antar catur dvāre aṅgārān upasandhāya tam svedayet 	As an alternative, the patient should be seated inside a chamber with four doors (one on each side) and fomented by lighting up a good blazing fire (of Khadira wood) at all the doors (simultaneously[9].

The paste should be heated and applied lukewarm to the affected part. 
evam kākolyādibhiḥ elādibhiḥ surasādibhiḥ tila atasī sarṣapa kalkaiḥ kṛsarā pāyasa utkārikābhiḥ veśavāraiḥ sālvaṇaiḥ vā tanu vastra avanaddhaiḥ svedayet 	The pastes of the drugs included within the Kakolyadi, the Eladi or the Surasadi groups as well as a paste of mustard seed, sesamum or linseed, or Krishara, Payasa (porridge) Utkarika, or Veshavara, or the drugs of Shalvana[10] (as described under the treatment of Vata-Vyadhi) should be similarly applied (lukewarm to the affected locality) folded in a piece of thin linen. 
drava svedaḥ tu vāta hara dravya kvātha pūrṇe koṣṇa kaṭāhe droṇyām vā avagāhya svedayet | 	Drava-Sveda (Diaphoresis with fluids):—A jar or a cauldron should be filled with a lukewarm decoction of any of the Vayu-subduing drugs and the patient should be immersed therein. 
evam payaḥ māṃsa rasa yūṣa taila dhānyāmla ghṛta vasā mūtreṣu avagāheta 	In the same way, the patient might be immersed in a tubful of warm milk, meat-soup, soup (of Mudga or Masha pulse), oil, Dhanyamla (fermented or sour gruel), clarified butter, lard, cow’s urine, etc.[11] The patient may also be sprinkled over or washed with a tepid decoction (of the above-mentioned drugs).[12] This is what is called the Drava-Sveda. 
tatra tāpa ūṣma svedau viśeṣataḥ śleṣma ghnau | 	Of the four forms of Sveda described above those known as the Tapa-Sveda and Ushma-Sveda pre-eminently destroy the deranged Kapha, while the UpanahaSveda subdues the deranged Vayu of the body; the Drava-Sveda, however, is beneficial in cases due to the concerted action of the deranged Pitta with either of the other two Doshas (viz., Vayu and Kapha). 
kapha medaḥ nvite vāyau nivāta ātapa guru prāvaraṇa niyuddha adhva vyāyāma bhāra haraṇa amarṣaiḥ svedam utpādayet iti 	The patient should be diaphorised by making him put on warm clothing or exposing himself to the sun or by becoming fatigued after a long walk, or by wrestling, or some other physical exercise, load-carrying, etc., or by arousing his anger in a case where the deranged Vayu would be found to be subcharged with the deranged fat or Kapha, 10. 
bhavanti ca atra caturvidhaḥ yaḥ abhihitaḥ dvidhā svedaḥ prayujyate sarvasmin eva dehe tu dehasya avayave tathā 	The four forms of Sveda mentioned above may be employed in two ways, viz.:—either to the whole body or to any particular part of it. 
yeṣām nasyam vidhātavyam vastiḥ ca eva hi dehinām śodhanīyāḥ ca ye kecid pūrvam svedyāḥ tu te matāḥ 	Sveda should be first employed in cases of patients fit to be treated with errhines (Nasya), purgatives, emetics or with Vasti-measures.

svedyaḥ pūrvam ca paścāt ca bhagaṃdarī arśasaḥ tathā 	Sveda should similarly be applied both before and after the surgical operation in cases of fistula-in-ano and stones, gravel, etc., (in the bladder) and of hemorrhoids. 
aśmaryā cāturaḥ jantuḥ śeṣān śāstre pracakṣmahe 	Specific modes of applying Sveda in other diseases should be duly described under their respective heads, 11. 
na anabhyakte na api ca asnigdha dehe svedaḥ yojyaḥ sveda vidbhiḥ kathañcid 	Men conversant with the rules of Sveda (fomentations, etc.) should, under no circumstances, employ it before rubbing or softening the body or the limb with a Sneha (oil, etc.) inasmuch as a piece of wood is found to break or burst immediately under the application of heat if not previously rubbed with a Sneha. 
agneḥ dīptim mārdavam tvac prasādam bhakta śraddhām srotasām nirmala tvam 	Improved digestive capacity (Agni-dipti), softness of the limbs, smoothness and clearness of the skin, relish for food, clearness of the bodily ducts or channels, absence of somnolence and drowsiness and restored functions (free movements) of the numbed bone-joints are the benefits which result from an application of Sveda.

svedāt eṣām yānti dehāḥ vināśam na usādhya tvam yānti ca eṣām vikārāḥ 	It is also prohibited in respect of pregnant women and intoxicated persons, inasmuch as an application of Sveda proves fatal in these cases or tends to impart an incurable character to the disease (inflicting an irreparable injury to the whole organism).

samyak svinnam vimṛditam snātam uṣṇa ambuṣu śanais|| 	After a full and complete application of Sveda, the (body of the) patient should be well rubbed with a Sneha (oil, etc.) and a hot bath should be prescribed. 
su abhyaktam prāvṛta aṅgam ca nivāta śaraṇa sthitam 	The patient should then be made to keep his body well covered (with warm clothes) and be removed to a windless chamber (immediately afterwards). 
bhojayet anabhiṣyandi sarvam ca ācāram ādiśet 	The diet should consist of such articles as would not produce any internal secretion (in the channels of the system) and he should observe, if necessary, the ether rules of Conduct (enjoined in such cases).

atha atas vamanavirecanasādhyopadravacikitsitam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the treatment of the distresses which prove amenable to the use of purgatives and emetics (Vamana-VirecanaSadhyopadrava).

snigdha svinnāya vamanam dattam samyak pravartate 	An emetic medicine does its fullest action, when given to a man after having applied a Sneha and Sveda (to him) and after having stirred up the Doshas of his body with the help of a soft mucilaginous (Kapha-producing)[1] fluid and emollient food so as to accelerate their easy expulsion from the system 4.

pīta auṣadham ca pāṇibhiḥ agni taptaiḥ pratāpyamānam muhūrtam upekṣeta 	After the emetic has been administred, the body of the patient should be (gently) fomented for a short time with the heated palms of the hands and the effect (of the emetic) observed.) The dislodgment and passing of the Doshas from their respective seats into the Kukshi (stomach?) should be inferred from the flow of perspiration (Sveda) that would ensue.

Then a finger or the stem of (a leaf of) a castor plant or of a lotus should be inserted down his throat and the patient should be made to fully eject the contents of his stomach until the symptoms of satisfactory vomiting would fully appear. 
kapha prasekam hṛdya aviśuddhim kaṇḍūm ca duśchardita liṅgam āhuḥ 	The symptoms of an imperfect emesis are water-brash (Kaphapraseka), sticking secretion or sensation of impurity in the regions of the Hridaya (heart) and itching sensations.

pitte kaphasya anu sukham pravṛtte śuddheṣu hṛd kaṇṭha śiraḥsu ca api 	The indications which characterise the perfect and satisfactory action of an emetic remedy are the free emission of Pitta after that of Kapha, a light and pleasing sensation in the heart, the throat and the head, a lightness of the body and the complete cessation of the emission of Kapha (mucus). 
samyak vāntam ca enam abhisamīkṣya snehana virecana śamanānām dhūmānām anyatamam sāmarthyataḥ pāyayitvā ācārikam ādiśet 	Thus having observed the symptoms of a satisfactory emesis, the patient should be advised to inhale the fumes (Dhuma) of a (burning) drug of either the Snehana, Vairecana or Samana (soothing) virtues in such doses as he could conveniently take and to observe the proper regimen of diet and conduct. 
tatas aparāhṇe śuci śuddha deham uṣṇābhiḥ addbhiḥ pariṣikta gātram kulattha mudga āḍhakī jāṅgalānām yūṣaiḥ rasaiḥ vā api upabhojayet tu 	Then having washed his body with tepid water and having perceived him to be in a pure state of mind and body the patient should be advised to take his evening meal with the soup of Kulattha or of Mudga or of Adhaki or with the soup of the flesh of any Jangala animal.[4] A person treated with emetics (at regular intervals) by cough, accumulation of Kapha in the throat, loss of voice, somnolence, drowsiness, fetid smell in the mouth, evil effects of poisoning (other supervening distresses of Kapha—D. 
	R.), water-brash and lienteric diarrhea (Grahani). 
chinne tarau puṣpa phala prarohāḥ yathā vināśam sahasā vrajanti tathā hṛte śleṣmaṇi śodhanena tad jāḥ vikārāḥ praśamam prayānti 	The (accumulated) Kapha of the system having been ejected by vomiting under a course of emetic treatment the possibility of all Kapha-origined affections is removed, just as a felled tree soon dries up together with all its twigs, fruits and flowers.

mādhutailika vidhānam ca nirūhopakrama cikitsite vakṣyāmaḥ 	The process of Madhu-tailika would be described in connection with the mode of applying a Niruha-vasti. 
anuvasan api na duṣyati anudivasam vā dīyate iti anuvāsanaḥ 	An Anuvasana-vasti is so called from the fact of its not injuring the system even in the event of its being retained in the bowels a whole day, or from the fact of its being adapted to daily application.

pakvāśayāt vasti vīryam khaiḥ deham anusarpati vṛkṣa mūle niṣiktānām apām vīryam iva drumam 	The potency of the Vasti (medicine) spreads over the whole organism from the intestines (Pakvashaya), just as the potency of the water poured at the root of a tree tends to permeate the whole tree (through its minutest cells and fibres). 
sa ca api sahasā vastiḥ kevalaḥ sa malaḥ api vā pratyeti vīryam tu anilaiḥ apāna ādyaiḥ vinīyate 	The liquid part of the Vasti is emitted out through the rectum either by itself or with the fecal matter, etc.[4], but its potency acts over the whole organism through the intervention of the Apana and the other Vayus. 
vīryeṇa vastiḥ ādatte doṣān āpāda mastakāt pakvāśaya sthaḥ ambara gaḥ bhūmeḥ arkaḥ rasān iva 	The potency of the Vasti in the Pakvashaya acts on the whole organism from top to toe, like the sun in the heavens acting on the humidity (Rasa) of the earth below.

tasmāt tasya ativṛddhasya śarīram abhinighnataḥ vāyoḥ viṣa hate vegam na anyā vasteḥ ṛte kriyā pavana āviddha toyasya velā vegam iva udadheḥ 	As the aggravation of all the Doshas (morbific principles) of the body is principally dependent on the derangement of the bodily Vayu; an aggravated condition of the latter may hence lead to the dissolution of the body, and consequently the application of a Vasti, and nothing else, is the only means of coping with the aggravation of the Vayu (by subduing and restoring it to its normal condition), just as the sea-coast is the only barrier to the swollen and wind-agitated surf of the sea. 
śarīra upacayam varṇam balam ārogyam āyuṣaḥ kurute parivṛddhim ca vastiḥ samyak upāsitaḥ 	A well-applied Vasti contributes to the growth, health, strength and longevity of the body and to the improvement in its complexion.

asrimat iti ekādaśa netra doṣāḥ 	Excessive thickness, coarseness, bending down, narrowness, cleavage, nearness or distance of the tying bands (Karnika), narrowness or excessive width of its internal aperture, excessive length or extreme shortness are the eleven defects which the pipe of a Vasti (Netra-dosha) may have. 
prastīrṇa tā durbaddha tā iti pañca vasti doṣāḥ 	The five objectionable features in the bladder (Vasti-dosha) are an excessive flabbiness, narrowness, width of its internal aperture, leakiness and an imperfect bending at its mouth (neck). 
śithila pīḍita tā bhūyas bhūyas avapīḍanam | kāla atikramaḥ iti catvāraḥ pīḍana doṣāḥ 	Variation in pressures put upon a Vasti (Enema syringe) during its application may be attended with any of the four objectionable features (Pidana-dosha), viz., overpressure (pressing the injection into the rectum with an injuriously excessive force), under-pressure, repeated pressures and pressure at long intervals. 
ati sāndra tā atidrava tā iti ekādaśa dravya doṣāḥ 	The eleven defects in the ingredients of the Vasti (Dravya-dosha) are insufficient cooking, excessive or insufficient quantity, extreme coldness, excessive heat, extreme keenness of potency, excessive mildness, excess or want of oiliness (Sneha), extreme thickness of consistency and overfluidity. 
ātura nimittāḥ pañcadaśa ātura upadrava cikitsite vakṣyante 	These are the twenty-four defects which attend the wrong application of a Vasti owing to the ignorance or inexperience of a physician, while those which are the effects of the injudiciousness of a patient are fifteen in number and would be described in the chapter on aturopadravaChikitsita (Chapter XXXIX, Chikitsita-sthana). 
snehaḥ tu aṣṭabhiḥ kāraṇaiḥ pratihataḥ na pratyāgacchati tribhiḥ doṣaiḥ | aśana abhibhūtaḥ | mala vyāmiśro | 	The Sneha injected into the bowels by a Vasti is obstructed in its passage and cannot consequently leave the system but is retained in it through any of the following eight causes, viz, obstruction of the food by the three Doshas, its admixture with the fecal matter (accumulated in the bowels), its being injected too high up into the intestines, an omission to foment (the patient’s body), using the Sneha in a cold state or in a small quantity and lastly use of no meals or of scanty meals by the patient previous to the application of a Vasti. 
alpam bhuktavataḥ | alpaḥ ca iti vaidya ātura nimittāḥ bhavanti ayogaḥ tu ubhayoḥ 	These (retentive conditions) are due to the indiscretion of both the physician and the patient. 
aṅga pragrahaḥ atiyogaḥ | jīvādānam iti nava vyāpadaḥ vaidya nimittāḥ bhavanti 	Nine distressing symptoms (Vyapad) namely as a defective application of either the Anuvasana or the asthapana Vastis, distension of the abdomen, (adhmana), a cutting pain in the region of the anus, (Parikartika) Dysenteric stools (Parisrava), diarrhea (Pravahika), affecting the heart (Hridayaopasarana), catching pain in the limbs, over-dosage, hemorrhage manifest themselves in consequence of any act of indiscretion of the physician in attendance. 
ṣaṭsaptatiḥ samāsena vyāpadaḥ parikīrtitāḥ 	The seventy-six kinds of the distressing symptoms (Vyapad) have been briefly described above. 
tāsām vakṣyāmi vijñānam siddhim ca tad anantaram 	Their symptoms and treatment would be described in the following chapter. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām cikitsā sthāne netravastipramāṇapravibhāgacikitstitam nāma pañcatriṃśaḥ adhyāyaḥ ṣaṭtriṃśattamaḥ adhyāyaḥ 	Thus ends the Thirty-fifth Chapter in the Chikitsita Sthana in the Sushruta Samhita which deals with the dimensions, classifications and therapeutical applications of a Netra and a Vasti. 
atha atas netrabastivyāpaccikitsitam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ 	Now we shall discourse on the medical treatment of the mishaps which are consequent on an injudicious application of the pipe and of the vasti (Netravasti-Vaypach-Chikitsita). 
gude kṣatam rujā vā syāt tatra sadyaḥkṣata kriyāḥ 	A displacement or retroversion of the pipe during the application of a Vasti produces a painful and bleeding ulcer in the rectum, which should be treated as a recent or incidental ulcer. 
ati utkṣipte avasanne ca netre pāyau bhavet rujā 	An extremely up-turned or down-turned posture of the pipe at the time gives rise to a pain in the rectum which should be treated with Pitta-subduing remedies and sprinkled with Snehas (oil, clarified butter, etc.). 
mukhasya āvaraṇāt vastiḥ na samyak pratipadyate 	A slanting or one-sided posture of the pipe after its introduction into the rectum causes its mouth to be closed and thus prevents a complete and satisfactory injection of the fluid (into the bowels). 
ṛju netram vidheyam syāt tatra samyak vijānatā|| 	Hence its mouth should be held straight (and steady) by an experienced physician. 
ati sthūle karkaśe ca netre astrimati gharṣaṇāt 	The use of an excessively thick or rough pipe or of one with a downturned or bent mouth, produces a bleeding and painful ulcer in the rectum which should be remedied in the manner mentioned above.

prakṛṣṭa karṇike raktam guda marma prapīḍanāt 	In a case of the Karnika (attached to the pipe) being at a greater distance from the mouth of the pipe, it would hurt the Guda-marma (marma at the anus) and produce a considerable bleeding therefrom.

mūrchām dāham atīsāram pittam ca ati uṣṇa tīkṣṇakau 	The application of a Vasti charged with an extremely warm or strong solution produces epileptic fits, a burning sensation, diarrhea and (an aggravated condition of the) Pitta.

snigdhaḥ ati jāḍya kṛt rūkṣaḥ stambha ādhmāna kṛt ucyate 	The application of a Vasti charged with a fluid consisting of an excessive quantity of Sneha would produce a general inertness of the organism, (dullness of organic functions), while one entirely bereft of any Sneha would produce numbness of the organism and a distension of the abdomen. 
atipīḍita vat doṣān viddhi ca api avaśīrṣake 	The application of a Vasti to a patient with his head downward is attended with symptoms peculiar to an act of over-pressing (the bladder of the Vasti), and the remedy also would be similar. 
ucchīrṣake samunnāham vastiḥ kuryāt ca mehanam tatra uttaraḥ hitaḥ vastiḥ su svinnasya sukha āvahaḥ 	The application of a Vasti to a patient with his head held up high and erect would block the urethra, i.e., would suppress the urine, in which case the patient should be treated first with Sveda and then with an Uttara-vasti (urethral syringe)[6] which would give the patient much relief. 
nyubjasya vastiḥ na āpnoti pakvādhānam vimārga gaḥ 	The injected fluid goes astray (within the abdomen) and fails to enter into the intestines (Pakvashaya) in the event of the patient lying in a stooping posture during the application of a Vasti.

rātrau vastim na dadyāt tu doṣa utkleśaḥ hi rātri jaḥ 	A Vasti should not be applied in the night since the Doshas of the system are (generally) aggravated at this time and since the Sneha (of the Vasti j owing to its potency is likely to give rise to a distention of the abdomen attended with fever and heaviness of the limbs. 
ahni sthāna sthite doṣe vahnau ca anna rasa anvite sphuṭa srotaḥ mukhe dehe sneha ojaḥ parisarpati 	The mouths of the internal ducts of the body remain dilated and the Doshas remain in their proper places ( i.e., are not generally agitated), and the digestive fire remains surcharged with the essence of the digestive food during the day time, hence the potency (Ojas) of a Sneha-vasti employed during the day time easily spreads through the ducts of the body. 
pitte adhike kaphe kṣīṇe rūkṣe vāta ruj ardite nare rātrau tu dātavyam kāle ca uṣṇe anuvāsanam 	An Anuvasanavasti may be applied during (the early part of) the night in summer in a case marked by a preponderance of the deranged Pitta and a (consequent) weakness of the Kapha, and an extremely parched condition of the organism, as well as in cases of the affections of Vayu (Vata-roga). 
uṣṇe pitta adhike vā api divā dāha ādayaḥ gadāḥ 	Unfavourable symptoms such as a burning sensation in the body, etc., arise from the application of a Vasti in the day time during a preponderance of the Pitta, or in summer. 
saṃbhavanti yatas tasmāt pradoṣe yojayet bhiṣaj|| 	The physician should, therefore, make such applications in the evening (Pradosha) in such instances. 
ahorātrasya kāleṣu sarveṣu eva anila adhikam 	A Sneha-vasti should be employed during the day in spring and winter and in the evening during summer and the rainy season, with a view to ward off the dangers due to the misapplication in the internal use of a Sneha.[5] It may, however, be applied at any time during the day, or in the night in a case marked by a preponderance of the deranged bodily Vayu. 
tīvrāyām ruji jīrṇa annam bhojayitvā anuvāsayet 	In the serious stage of a disease an Anuvasanaenema should be applied after the patient has partaken of a second meal, having already digested his previous one. 
na ca a bhuktavataḥ snehaḥ praṇidheyaḥ kathañcana śuddha tvāt śūnya koṣṭhasya snehaḥ ūrdhvam samutpatet 	The use of a Sneha-vasti is forbidden in an empty stomach as it might otherwise send the injected fluid higher up into the intestines owing to the emptiness and cleansed[6] (unencumbered) state of the stomach. 
jvaram vidagdha bhuktasya kuryāt snehaḥ prayojitaḥ 	An application of the Anuvasana-vasti should be made just after a meal, since the application of a Vasti made during the continuance of a partially digested or undigested meal in the stomach brings on fever. 
na ca ati snigdham aśanam bhojayitvā anuvāsayet 	An Anuvasana enema should not, however, be applied after the patient had taken his meal, richly saturated or cooked with a Sneha (oil or clarified butter), since the double introduction of the Sneha into the system through the medium of food and the Vasti brings on vertigo and epilepsy. 
rūkṣam bhuktavataḥ hi annam balam varṇam ca hāpayet 	The strength and complexion of the patient suffer much by the application of an Anuvasana-vasti after he has taken a dry (Ruksha) meal containing no Sneha. 
yukta sneham atas jantum bhojayitvā anuvāsayet 	A patient should, therefore, be first fed with a diet saturated with a moderate quantity of an oleaginous substance before being treated with an Anuvasana-vasti. 
yūṣa kṣīra rasaiḥ tasmāt yathāvyādhi samīkṣya vā 	The patient before being treated with an Anuvasana vasti should be fed with Mudga-soup[7], cow’s milk and meat-essence to a quarter part[9] less than the quantity he can ordinarily take. 
atha anuvāsyam su abhyaktam uṣṇa ambu sveditam śanais 	The body of the patient to be treated with an Anuvasana vasti should be first anointed (with a Sneha) and gently fomented with hot water.

tāḍayet talayoḥ enam trīn trīn vārān śanais śanais 	The patient should be gently struck[10] three times on each of the soles and the palms of his hands and on the buttocks[11]. 
sphicoḥ ca enam tatas śayyām trīn vārān utkṣipet tatas 	The (patient with his) bedding should be thrice raised (and shaken with gentle jerks). 
evam praṇihite vastau manda āyāsaḥ atha manda vāc su āstīrṇe śayane kāmam āsīta ācārike rataḥ 	After that he should be laid on a bed stretched out at full length and be advised to speak and exert himself as little as possible and conform to a strict regimen of diet and conduct. 
deyaḥ sukha uṣṇaḥ ca tathā nireti sahasā sukham 	A quantity of Shatahva and Saindhava should be mixed with the Sneha (to be used in the Vasti) and (the whole compound) applied lukewarm, inasmuch as the injected Sneha would thereby easily flow back (without producing any pain and burning sensation, etc.) and dribble down in due time after the application. 
ati auṣṇyāt ati taikṣṇyāt vā vāyunā vā prapīḍitaḥ sa vātaḥ adhika mātraḥ vā guru tvāt vā sa bheṣajaḥ tasya anyaḥ alpataraḥ deyaḥ na hi snihyati atiṣṭhati 	If at any time a quantity of the Sneha injected into the bowels in the manner of an Anuvasana enema (Vasti) is instantly driven back by the pressure of the incarcerated abdominal Vayu, or the Vayu (air) of the bladder (Vasti\ or by an excessive heat, keenness (in potency), or an over-dose of the injected fluid itself, or by the over dose of the medicines (subsequently) added thereto, a Snehavasti charged with a smaller dose of the Sneha should be again applied, since a Sneha un retained in the abdomen fails to produce any emulsive effect. 
viṣṭabdha anila viṣ mūtraḥ sneha hīne anuvāsane 	Retention of stool, urine and Vayu (flatus) is produced by using an insufficient quantity of Sneha in an Anuvasana-vasti. 
dāha klama pravāha ārti karaḥ ca ati anuvāsanaḥ sa anilaḥ sa purīṣaḥ ca snehaḥ pratyeti yasya tu 	A burning sensation in the body, diarrhea (Pravaha) and fatigue accompanied with pain set in as the natural resultants of an excessive Anuvasana enema. 
oṣa coṣau vinā śīghram sa samyak anuvāsitaḥ 	The satisfactory nature of the application of an Anuvasana-vasti should be inferred from the timely discharge of the injected Sneha with flatus and fecal matter[12] out of the bowels of a patient without giving rise to any distressing symptoms such as burning and sucking[13] sensations, etc. 
jīrṇa annam atha sāyāhne snehe pratyāgate punar 	The patient may be given a light[14] meal or diet in the evening, in case he is possessed of a keen digestive capacity[15], subsequent to the digestion of a previous meal and (should he feel hungry) after the discharging of the injected Sneha. 
prātar uṣṇa udakam deyam dhānya nāgara sādhitam 	Tepid water boiled with Dhanyaka and Shunthi should be given hot to the patient on the (following) morning as it would sharpen his appetite and produce a fresh relish for food. 
sneha vasti krameṣu evam vidhim āhuḥ manīṣiṇaḥ 	This is the procedure of applying a Sneha-vasti. 
anena vidhinā ṣaṭ vā sapta vā aṣṭau nava eva vā vidheyāḥ vastayaḥ teṣām antarā tu nirūhaṇam 	Six, seven, eight or nine applications of Sneha-vastis should in this manner be made in succession alternately with those of a Nirudha-vasti. 
dattaḥ tu prathamaḥ vastiḥ snehayet vasti vaṅkṣaṇau 	The first application of the Vasti permeates the pelvic and the inguinal regions with the emulcent essence of the injected Sneha. 
samyak dattaḥ dvitīyaḥ tu mūrdha stham anilam jayet 	The second tends to restore the Vayu in the cephalic part of the body to its normal condition.

ṣaṣṭhaḥ tu snehayet māṃsam medaḥ saptamaḥ eva ca aṣṭamaḥ navamaḥ ca asthi majjānam ca yathākramam 	In this way the fifth application of a Vasti permeates the blood, the sixth the flesh, the seventh the fat, the eighth the bones, and the ninth the marrow with the oily essence. 
evam śukra gatān doṣān dviguṇaḥ sādhu sādhayet 	This series of Vasti-applications repeated twice tends to purify the semen from all its impure or unhealthy constituents. 
yathokena vidhānena parihāra krameṇa ca sa kuñjara balaḥ aśvasya javaiḥ tulyaḥ amara prabhaḥ vīta pāpmā śruta dharaḥ sahasra āyuḥ naraḥ bhavet 	A person treated with eighteen series (three hundred and twenty-four in number) of such Sneha-vastis and Niruha-vastis in the above mentioned way and observing the prescribed rules of diet and conduct is enabled to develop a muscular strength in no way inferior to that of an elephant, and to live a sinless life a thousand years, in the full enjoyment of his intellectual faculties, god-like beauty and horse-like swiftness. 
sneha vastim nirūham vā na ekam eva atiśīlayet snehāt agni vadha utkleśau nirūhāt pavanāt bhayam 	An excessive application of only one kind of Vasti, either of a Sneha-vasti, or of a Niruha vasti, should be avoided, since an excess of the first (Sneha-vasti) tends to impair the digestive capacity[16] and to bring on an aggravation of the deranged Kapha, while an excess of the second (Niruha-vasti) tends to aggravate the bcdily Vayu. 
tasmāt nirūḍhaḥ anuvāsyaḥ nirūhyaḥ ca anuvāsitaḥ na evam pitta kapha utkleśau syātām na pavanāt bhayam 	Hence an application of the Sneha-vasti should be followed by one of the Niruha-vasti and vice versa, in order to avoid all apprehension of an aggravation of Pitta, Kapha and Vayu. 
rūkṣāya bahu vātāya sneha vastim dine dine 	Daily applications of a Snehavasti are not forbidden in respect of a person of parched or dry (Ruksha) and Vayu-predominating temperament, while in other instances they should be made on each fourth day, so that the digestive capacity might not be thereby impaired. 
snehaḥ alpa mātraḥ rūkṣāṇām dīrgha kālam anatyayaḥ 	The application of a moderate quantity of Sneha with a Sneha-vasti is always beneficial to persons of parched or dry temperament. 
tathā nirūhaḥ snigdhānām alpa mātraḥ praśasyate 	Similarly, an application of the Niruha vasti in a small quantity always proves beneficial to the persons who have been already treated with a Sneha (Vasti). 
atas ūrdhvam pravakṣyāmi vyāpadaḥ sneha vasti jāḥ 	Now we shall describe the distresses which are found to attend (an abuse or excess of) a Sneha vasti. 
balavantaḥ yadā doṣāḥ koṣṭhe syuḥ anila ādayaḥ alpa vīryam tadā sneham abhibhūya pṛthagvidhān kurvanti upadravān snehaḥ sa ca api na nivartate 	Various kinds of distressing symptoms are produced by the application of a Sneha vasti of a mild or weak potency in the case of a patient whose stomach is filled with the aggravated Doshas so that the Sneha cannot flow back, being overwhelmed, as it would be, by the aggravated Doshas. 
tatra vāta abhibhūte tu snehe mukha kaṣāya tā jṛmbhāḥ vāta rujaḥ tāḥ tāḥ vepathuḥ viṣamajvaraḥ 	An astringent taste in the mouth, yawning, shivering and Vishama-Jvara with the peculiar Vayu origined distempers such as, pain (in the limbs) are the symptoms which mark the retention of the injected Sneha in the bowels over-whelmed by the action of the deranged Vayu. 
pitta abhibhūte snehe tu mukhasya kaṭu tā bhavet 	Fever, a burning ; sensation (of the body), thirst, perspiration, a pungent taste in the mouth and yellowness of the complexion, urine and the eyes are the features which are due to the retention of the injected Sneha in the bowels overwhelmed by the action of the deranged Pitta.

tatra doṣa abhibhūte tu snehe vastim nidhāpayet yathāsvam doṣa śamanāni upayojyāni yāni ca 	In these cases, applications of (Sneha) Vastis and such other remedial measures as are soothing to the Dosha or Doshas (giving rise to the retention of the Sneha in the bowels) should be adopted with due regard to the nature and intensity of each. 
guruḥ āmāśayaḥ śūlam vāyoḥ ca apratisaṃcaraḥ hṛd pīḍā mukha vairasya śvāsaḥ mūrchā bhramaḥ aruciḥ 	Cramps (Shula) and heaviness in the stomach (Amashaya), suppression of the Vayu (flatus), affection of the heart, a bad taste in the mouth, difficult respiration, epileptic fits, vertigo and an aversion to food are the symptoms which attend a retention of the Sneha in the bowels owing to the pressure of food matter carried down into the abdomen of a person who has been so treated after a heavy meal, and they should be remedied first by fasting and then by appetising measures. 
aśuddhasya mala unmiśraḥ snehaḥ na eti yadā punar tadā aṅga sadana ādhmāne śvāsaḥ śūlam ca jāyate 	A languid feeling in the limbs attended with a distension of the abdomen, colic (Shula), difficult breathing and a sense of heaviness in the intestines mark the retention of the injected Sneha surcharged with the fecal matter of a person previously uncleansed by proper remedies.

gātreṣu sarva indriyāṇām upalepaḥ avasādanam sneha gandhi mukham ca api kāsa śvāsau arocakaḥ 	A scent of the Sneha in the mouth, cough, difficult breathing, an aversion to food and dullness of all sense-organs which become internally charged with a coating of oil and a glossy appearance of the skin (mouth—D. 
atipīḍita vat tatra siddhiḥ āsthāpanam tathā 	Such a case should be treated as a case of Ati-pidita (over pressure on the bladder of the) enema and with the applications of Asthapana-vastis as well. 
asvinnasya aviśuddhasya snehaḥ alpaḥ saṃprayojitaḥ 	An inadequate quantity of Sneha of a mild or weak potency, injected cold with the help of an enema, is not retained in the system, if not duly fomented and cleansed before, but gives rise to scanty stools, cramps (Shula), heaviness and distention in the region of the intestines (Pakvashaya) and (ultimate) suppression of stool, etc. 
vibandha gaurava ādhmāna śūlāḥ pakvāśayam prati tatra āsthāpanam eva āśu prayojyam sa anuvāsanam 	Such cases should be speedily remedied by the application of an asthapana as well as by that of an Anuvasana-vasti.

ahorātrāt api snehaḥ pratyāgacchat na duṣyati 	The Sneha of a Vasti, if found to dribble down (from the system) after the lapse of even a whole day and night from the time of its application, without giving rise to any physical discomfort, does no mischief but exerts all the good effects of the application of the Vasti. 
kuryāt vasti guṇān ca api jīrṇaḥ tu alpa guṇaḥ bhavet 	Whereas, if digested, it produces but very little benefit to the patient. 
yasya na upadravam kuryāt sneha vastiḥ aniḥsṛtaḥ sarvaḥ alpaḥ vā āvṛtaḥ raukṣyāt upekṣyaḥ sa vijānatā 	The retention of the whole or of any portion of the Sneha injected into the bowels of a patient without producing any special physical discomfort should be ascribed to an extremely parched or dry condition of his organism, and would not require any special medical treatment. 
anāyāntam tu ahorātrāt sneham saṃśodhanaiḥ haret 	In case of a Sneha not flowing out from the bowels within a period of twenty-four hours of its introduction (and in case of its producing any supervening symptoms), corrective (Shodhana) remedies should be employed and all subsequent applications of Sneha should be stopped. 
iti uktāḥ vyāpadaḥ sarvā sa lakṣaṇa cikitsitāḥ 	Thus we have finished describing the diseases (Vyapat) and symptoms which result from the injudicious use of Sneha (Vastis) together with the nature of the medical treatment to be employed in each of them.

krodhaḥ vigrahavān bhūtvā nipapāta ati dāruṇaḥ 	At this the omnipotent god grew extremely wrathful. 
sa tam dadāha garjantam antaka ābham mahā balam 	The vehement wrath of the god gradually swollen and inflamed, at last emanated in physical forms from his mouth and reduced the mighty, death-like, roaring fiend to ashes. 
tatas asuram ghātayitvā tat tejaḥ avardhata adbhutam tatas viṣādaḥ devānām abhavat tam nirīkṣya vai 	But the energy of that terrific wrath went on increasing even after the destruction of the demon, at the sight of which the gods were greatly depressed in spirit. 
viṣāda janana tvāt ca viṣam iti abhidhīyate 	The term Visha (poison) is so called from the fact of its filling the gods with Vishada (depression of spirits). 
vinyastavān sa bhūtesu sthāvareṣu careṣu ca yathā avyakta rasam toyam antarīkṣāt mahī gatam 	After that the god of creation, having finished his (self imposed) task of creating this world, cast that wrath both into the mobile and the immobile creations Just as the atmospheric water which is of imperceptible and undeveloped taste, acquires the specific taste of the ground or soil it falls upon, so it is the very nature of the (tasteless) Visha that it partakes of the specific taste (Rasa) of a thing or animal in which it exists. 
viṣe yasmāt guṇāḥ sarve tīkṣṇāḥ prāyeṇa santi hi 	All the sharp and violent qualities are present in poison. 
viṣam sarvam atas jñeyam sarva doṣa prakopaṇam 	Hence poisons should be considered as aggravating and and deranging all the Doshas of the body. 
te tu vṛttim prakupitāḥ jahati svām viṣa arditāḥ 	The Doshas aggravated and charged with poison forego their own specific functions. 
na upayati viṣam pākam atas prāṇān ruṇaddhi ca 	Hence poison can never be digested or assimilated in the system. It stops the power of inhaling. 
śleṣmaṇā āvṛta mārga tvāt ucchvāsaḥ asya nirudhyate 	Expiration (exhalation of the breath) becomes impossible owing to the internal passages having been choked by the deranged Kapha. 
visaṃjñaḥ sati jīve api tasmāt tiṣṭhati mānavaḥ śukra vat sarva sarpāṇām viṣam sarva śarīra gam 	Consequently a poisoned person drops down in an unconscious state even when life is still present within his body. The poison of a snake like the semen in an adult male lies diffused all through its organism. 
kruddhānām eti ca aṅgebhyaḥ śukram nirmanthanāt iva teṣām baḍiśa vat daṃṣṭrāḥ tāsu sajjati ca āgatam 	As semen is gathered up, dislodged and subsequently emitted through the urethra by being agitated (by contact with woman, etc.), so the poison in a snake is gathered up and secreted through the holes of its fangs under the conditions of anger and agitation. 
anudvṛttāḥ viṣam tasmāt na muñcanti ca bhoginaḥ 	The fangs being hook-shaped, a snake cannot secrete its poison without lowering its hood just after a bite. 
yasmāt atyartham uṣṇam ca tīkṣṇam ca paṭhitam viṣam atas sarva viṣeṣu uktaḥ pariṣekaḥ tu śītalaḥ 	Since a poison of whatever sort is extremely keen, sharp and heat-making in its poteney, a copious sprinkling with cold water should be used in all cases of poisoning. 
mandam kīṭeṣu na ati uṣṇam bahu vāta kapham viṣam atas kīṭa viṣe ca api svedaḥ na pratiṣidhyate 	But since the poison of an insect is mild and not too much heat-making in its potency and as it engenders a large quantity of Vayu and Kapha in the organism, measures of fomentation (Sveda) are not forbidden in a case of insect-bite. 
kīṭaiḥ daṣṭān ugra viṣaiḥ sarpa vat samupācaret 	A bite by a strongly poisoned insect, however, should be treated as a snake-bite to all intents and purposes. 
svabhāvāt eva tiṣṭhet tu prahārāt aṃśayoḥ viṣam vyāpya sa avayavam deham digdha viddha ahi daṣṭayoḥ 	The poison of a venomed dart or of a snakebite courses through the whole organism of the victim but it is its nature that it returns to the place of hurt and bite respectively. 
laulyāt viṣa anvitam māṃsam yaḥ khādet mṛta mātrayoḥ yathāviṣam sa rogeṇa kliśyate mriyate api vā 	A man eating, from culpable gluttony, the flesh of such an animal, just dead (from the effects of poison), is afflicted with symptoms and diseases peculiar to the specific pathogenetic virtues of the poison with which the dead body is charged, and, in the long run, meets with his doom. 
atas ca api anayoḥ māṃsam abhakṣyam mṛta mātrayoḥ muhūrtāt tat upādeyam prahārāt aṃśa barjitam 	Hence the flesh of an animal killed by a venomed dart or a snake bite (should be considered as fatal as the poison itself and) should not be taken immediately after its death. 
ādhmātaḥ atyartham uṣṇa asraḥ vivarṇaḥ sāda pīḍitaḥ udvamati atha phenam ca viṣa pītam tam ādiśet 	Whoever passes a black sooty stool with loud flatus, or sheds hot tears and drops down with agony, and whose complexion becomes discoloured, and whose mouth becomes filled with foam, should be considered as afflicted with poison taken internally (Visha-pita). 
na ca asya hṛdayam vahniḥ viṣa juṣṭam dahati api tat hi sthānam cetanāyāḥ sva bhavāt vyāpya tiṣṭhiti 	The heart of such a man (dying from the effects of internal poisoning) cannot be burnt in fire; since the poison from its very nature lies extended in the whole viscera of the heart, the seat of cognition[8]. 
aśvattha devāyatana śmaśāna valmīka sandhyāsu catuṣpatheṣu 	A man bitten by a snake in any of the vulnerable parts of the body, or near (the root of) an Ashvatthva tree, or a temple, at the cremation ground or on an ant-hill, or at the meeting of day and night, or at the crossings of roads or under the influence of the Bharani or Magha asterisms (astral mansions) should be given up as lost. 
darvīkarāṇām viṣam āśu ghāti sarvāṇi ca uṣṇe dviguṇībhavanti 	The poison of a hooded cobra (Darvri-kara proves instantaneously fatal. All poisons become doubly strong and operative in summer (Ushna)[9]. 
ajīrṇa pitta ātapa pīḍiteṣu bāla pramehiṣu atha garbhiṇīṣu vṛddha ātura kṣīṇa bubhukṣiteṣu rūkṣeṣu bhīruṣu atha durdineṣu 	In cases of persons suffering from indigestion, urinary complaints, or from the effects of deranged Pitta or oppressed with the heat of the sun (sun stroke) as well as infants, old men, invalids, emaciated persons, pregnant women, men of timid disposition, or of a dry temperament, or oppressed with hunger, or bitten on a cloudy day, the poisons become doubly strong and operative. 
śītābhiḥ adbhiḥ ca na romaharṣaḥ viṣa abhibhūtam parivarjayet tam 	On the other hand, a snake bitten person, into whose body an incision is unattended with bleeding, or on whose body the strokes of lashes leave no marks, nor does horripilation appear even after a copious pouring of cold water on the body, should be likewise given up as lost. 
jihvā sitā yasya ca keśa śātaḥ nāsā avabhaṅgaḥ ca sa kaṇṭha bhaṅgaḥ 	A case of snake-bite in which the tongue of the victim is found to be coated white and whose hair falls off (on the slightest pull), the bridge of whose nose becomes bent and the voice hoarse, where there is lockjaw and the appearance of a blackish-red swelling about the bite,—such a case should be given up as hopeless. 
vartiḥ ghanā yasya nireti vaktrāt raktam sravet ūrdhvam adhas ca yasya daṃṣṭrā nipātāḥ sakalāḥ ca yasya tam ca api vaidyaḥ parivarjayet tu 	The case in which thick, long lumps of mucus are expectorated accompanied by bleeding from both the upward and the downward orifices of the body with distinct impression of all the fangs on the bitten part, should be given up by the physician. 
sāriṣṭam atyartham aveginam ca jahyāt naram tatra na karma kuryāt|| 	A case of snake-bite marked by the symptoms of an insane state like that of a drunkard and accompanied by severe distressing symptoms (Upadrava), as well as loss of voice and complexion and an absence of the circulation of blood[10] and by other fatal symptoms should be abandoned and no action need be taken therein. 
iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām kalpasthāne jaṅgamaviṣavijñānīyaḥ nāma tṛtīyaḥ adhyāyaḥ 	Thus ends the third Chapter of the Kalpa-Sthana in the Sushruta Samhita which treats of animal poisons. 
atha atas sarpadaṣṭaviṣavijñānīyam kalpam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the Chapter which treats of the specific features of the poison of a snakebite Sarpa-dashta-Visha-Vijnaniya). 
sarpa saṃkhyām vibhāgam ca daṣṭa lakṣaṇam eva ca jñānam ca viṣa vegānām bhagavan vaktum arhasi tasya tat vacanam śrutvā prābravīt bhiṣajām varaḥ 	Having laid himself prostrate at the feet of the holy and wise Dhanvantari, the master of all the Shastras, Sushruta addressed him as follows:—“Enlighten and illumineus (illuminous?), O Lord, on the number and classification of snakes, on the nature of their poison and on the distinguishing marks of their respective bites”, whereupon Dhanvantari, the foremost of all physicians replied as follows:—Innumerable are the families of serpents, of which Takshaka and Vasuki are the foremost and the most renowned. 
mahīdharāḥ ca nāga indrāḥ huta agni sama tejasaḥ ye ca api ajasram garjanti varṣanti ca tapanti ca sa sāgara giri dvīpāḥ yaiḥ iyam dhāryate mahī 	These are supposed to carry the earth[1] with the oceans, mountains and the islands on their heads and are as powerful and furious as the blazing fire, fed upon the libations of clarified butter. 
kruddhāḥ niḥśvāsa dṛṣṭibhyām ye hanyuḥ akhilam jagat 	I make obeisance to those who constantly roar, bring down rain, scorch the whole world (with the heat of their hundred-headed venom) and are capable of destroying the universe with their angry looks and poisonous breath. 
namaḥ tebhyaḥ asti no teṣām kāryam kiñcid cikitsayā 	It is fruitless, O Sushruta, to enter into a discourse on the treatment of their bites as they are beyond the curative virtues of ail terrestrial remedies. 
ye tu daṃṣṭra viṣāḥ bhaumāḥ ye daśanti ca mānuṣān teṣām saṅkhyām pravakṣyāmi yathāvat anupūrvaśas 	I shall, however, describe in due order, the classification of the terrestrial snakes whose poison lies in their fangs wherewith they bite the human beings (and other animals). 
aśītiḥ tu eva sarpāṇām bhidyate pañcadhā tu sā darvīkarāḥ maṇḍalinaḥ rājimantaḥ tathā eva ca 	They are eighty in number, classified into five main genera, namely, the Darvi-kara (hooded), Mandali (hoodless and painted with circular patches or rings of varied colours on their skin), Rajiman (hoodless and striped), Nirvisha (non-venomous or slightly venomous) and Vaikaranja (hybrid species). 
nirviṣāḥ vaikarañjāḥ ca trividhāḥ te punar smṛtāḥ darvīkarāḥ maṇḍalinaḥ rājimantaḥ ca pannagāḥ 	The last named is also, in its turn, divided into three sub-divisions only, viz., the Darvi-kara (hooded), the Mandali (hoodless and ring-marked) and the Rajiman (striped ones). 
teṣu darvīkarāḥ jñeyāḥ viṃśatiḥ ṣaṭ ca pannagāḥ dvāviṃśatiḥ maṇḍalinaḥ rājimantaḥ tathā daśa nirviṣāḥ dvādaśa jñeyāḥ vaikarañjāḥ trayaḥ tathā 	Of these there are twenty six kinds of Darvi-kara snakes, twenty-two of the Mandali species, ten of the Raji-man class, twelve of the Nirvisha (non-venomous) species and three of the Vaikaranja (hybrid) species. 
vaikarañja udbhavāḥ sapta citrāḥ maṇḍali rājilāḥ 	Snakes born of Vaikaranja parents are of variegated colours (Citra) and are of seven different species (three of these being Mandali (marked with rings) and (four) Rajila (marked with stripes). 
pāda abhimṛṣṭāḥ duṣṭāḥ vā kruddhāḥ grāsa arthinaḥ api vā 	snake trampled under foot, or in a fit of anger or hunger, or anywise terrified or attacked, or out of its innate malicious nature, will bite a man or an animal. 
te daśanti mahā krodhāḥ trividham bhīma darśanāḥ 	The bites of these snakes highly enraged as they are, are grouped under three heads by men conversant with their nature, viz., Sarpita (deep-punctured), Radita (superficially punctured) and Nirvisha (non-venomous) bites. 
sarpitam raditam ca api tṛtīyam atha nirviṣam sarpa aṅga abhihatam kecid icchanti khalu tad vidaḥ 	Some of the authorities on snake bites,however, add a fourth kind viz., Sarpangabhihata (coming in contact with the body of a serpent). 
padāni yatra dantānām ekam dve vā bahūni vā 	The bite in which one, two or more marks (punctures) of fangs of considerable depth are found on the affected part attended with a slight bleeding as well as those which are extremely slender and owe their origin to the turning aside and lowering of its mouth (head) immediately after the bite and are attended with swelling and the characteristic changes (in the system of the victim) should be known as the Sarpita bite. 
vijñeyam raditam tat tu jñeyam alpa viṣam ca tat|| 	A (superficial) puncture (or punctures) made by the fangs of a snake and the affected part being attended with reddish, bluish, whitish or yellowish lines or stripes is called the Radita bite, which is characterised by the presence of a very small quantity of venom in the punctured wound. 
a śopham alpa duṣṭa asṛk prakṛti sthasya dehinaḥ 	A Nirvisha (nonvenomous) bite is marked by the presence of one or more fang marks, an absence of swelling and the presence of slightly vitiated blood at the spot and is not attended with any change in the normal (physiological) condition of the person bitten. 
sarpa spṛṣṭasya bhīroḥ hi bhayena kupitaḥ anilaḥ 	The contact of a snake with the body of a naturally timid person may cause the aggravation of his bodily Vayu and produce a swelling of the part. 
kasyacid kurute śopham sarpa aṅga abhihatam tu tat|| 	Such a man is said to be Sarpangabhihata[2] (affected by the touch of a snake). 
vyādhita udvigra daṣṭāni jñeyāni alpa viṣāṇi tu tathā ati vṛddha bāla abhidaṣṭam alpa viṣam smṛtam 	A bite by a diseased or agitated snake or by an extremely old or young one, should be considered as considerably less venomous.

jñeyāḥ maṇḍalinaḥ sarpāḥ jvalana arka sama prabhāḥ snigdhāḥ vividha varṇābhiḥ tiryak ūrdhvam ca rājibhiḥ citritāḥ iva ye bhānti rājimantaḥ tu te smṛtāḥ 	ring-like or circular spots on their skin, and have the glow of the sun or fire should be known as Mandali snakes, while those which are glossy and whose bodies are painted with parti-coloured horizontal, perpendicular and lateral stripes, should be known as the Rajiman species. 
muktā rūpya prabhāḥ ye ca kapilāḥ ye ca pannagāḥ sugandhayaḥ suvarṇa ābhāḥ te jātyāḥ brāhmaṇāḥ smṛtāḥ 	The snakes whose skin is lustrous like a pearl or silver, is coloured yellow and looks like gold and emits a sweet smell, should be regarded as belonging to the Brahmana species of snakes. 
kṣatriyāḥ snigdha varṇāḥ tu pannagāḥ bhṛśa kopanāḥ sūrya candra ākṛti chatra lakṣma teṣām tathā ambujam 	Those which are glossy, extremely irritable in their nature and marked with spots on their skin resembling the discs of the sun and moon, or of the shape of a conchshell (Ambuja) or an umbrella, should be regarded as belonging to the Kshatriya species.

kopayanti anilam jantoḥ phaṇinaḥ sarve eva tu pittam maṇḍalinaḥ ca api kapham ca aneka rājayaḥ 	The poison of all hooded snakes (Phani) deranges and aggravates the bodily Vayu, that of the Mandali (circular spotted) species aggravates the Pitta, while that of the Rajiman (striped) class aggravates the bodily Kapha. 
apatyam asavarṇābhyām dvi doṣa kara lakṣaṇam jñeyau doṣaiḥ ca dampatyoḥ viśeṣaḥ ca atra vakṣyate 	The poison of a snake of hybrid (Vaikaranja) origin aggravates the two particular Doshas of the body which its parents would have separately aggravated—a fact which helps us to ascertain the species to which its parents belong. 
rajanyāḥ paścime yāme sarpāḥ citrāḥ caranti hi śeṣeṣu uktāḥ maṇḍalinaḥ divā darvīkarāḥ smṛtāḥ 	A snake of the Rajiman species, is found abroad in the fourth or the last quarter of the night, the Mandali snakes are found to be out in the three preceding watches, while the Darvi-kara snakes are found to be abroad (in quest of prey) only in the day time. 
darvīkarāḥ tu taruṇāḥ vṛddhāḥ maṇḍalinaḥ tathā rājimantaḥ vayaḥ madhyāḥ jāyante mṛtyu hetavaḥ 	A Darvi-kara snake of tender age, a middle-aged Rajiman snake and an old Mandali snake are as fatal as personified death.

kim kāraṇam viṣam hi niśita nistriṃśa aśani hutavaha deśyam āśukāri muhūrtam api upekṣitam āturam atipātayati | 	Now we shall describe the general features of snakebites:—Why does snake-poison prove instantaneously fatal like a sharp sword, thunder-bolt or fire? Why is it that a case of snake bite, if neglected even for a very short time (Muhurta) at the outset, terminates in the death of the patient without (even) giving him an opportunity of speaking? 19-20. 
na ca avakāśaḥ asti vāc samūham upasartum pratyekam api daṣṭa lakṣaṇe abhihite sarvatra traividhyam bhavati | 	From the general characteristics of the bites, it should be presumed that they may be divided into three kinds.

daṃśasya upati badhnīyāt ariṣṭāḥ catur aṅgule 	In all cases of snake bites ligatures of cloth, skin, soft fibre or any other soft article (consecrated with the proper Mantras), should first of all be bound four fingers apart above the seat of the bite in the event of its occurring in the extremities, inasmuch as such a proceeding would arrest the further (upward) course of the poison in the body. 
dahet daṃśam atha utkṛtya yatra bandhaḥ na jāyate 	As an alternative, the seat of the bite should be incisioned, bled and cauterized where such a ligature would be found to be impossible.

atha maṇḍalinā daṣṭam na kathaṃcana dāhayet sa pitta bāhulya viṣāt daṃśaḥ dāhāt visarpate 	The seat of the bite by a Mandali snake should not, however, be cauterized inasmuch as the preponderant Pittaja character of the poison, aggravated by the application of the heat, might lead to its speedy expansion or coursing in the system.

mita āhāreṇa śucinā kuśa āstaraṇa śāyinā gandha mālya upahāraiḥ ca balibhiḥ ca api devatāḥ pūjayet mantra siddhi artham japa homaiḥ ca yatnataḥ 	For the successful application of his newly acquired knowledge (Mantras), he shall devotedly worship the gods with offerings of perfumes, garlands of flowers, edibles, (animal) oblations, etc., and with the appropriate Mantras sacred to them as well as with burnt offerings, since a Mantra chanted by a man in an unclean spirit or body, or accented or uttered incorrectly will not take effect. 
yasmāt na siddhim āyānti tasmāt yojyaḥ agada kramaḥ 	The medicinal compounds of anti-venomous drugs should also be employed in such cases. 
samantataḥ sirāḥ daṃśāt vidhyet tu kuśalaḥ bhiṣaj 	A skillful physician should open the veins round the seat of the bite and bleed the affected part.

dravam anyat tu yat kiñcid pītvā pītvā tat udvamet prāyas hi vamanena eva mukham nirhriyate viṣam 	The patient should be made to vomit with the help of any other suitable liquid available, since vomiting in most cases leads to the elimination of the poison from the system.

agadānām hi saṃyogaḥ viṣa juṣṭasya yujyate 	In a case of doubt or of conflicting indications pointing equally both to the venomous and non-venomous character of the bite, a physician should employ anti-poisonous remedies of such a character as would not prove hostile (to the natural temperament and vital principles of the patient’s system nor to the course of food and drink he is enjoined to take or naturally takes), since the Agadas are applicable only in cases of poisoning and, applied otherwise in healthy non-poisoned persons, would produce all kinds of discomfort.

atas adhikena api nihanyuḥ anyāḥ yāsām viṣam madhyama vīryam uktam 	That of a middle-poisonous one would take a little more time in order to prove fatal, while a bite by one of the mild-poisonous brings death within a fortnight.

makṣikā maśakān keśān jālakāni ca paśyati 	False images of gnats, flies, hairs, nets or cob-webs, rings (circular patches), flags, ear-rings appear to the sight, and the external objects seem to be enveloped in mist or haze or as if laid under a sheet of water or as viewed in rain and on cloudy days, and meteors of different colours seem to be falling constantly in all directions in the event of the deranged Doshas being similarly confined in the second Patala (coat) of the Drishti. 
samīpa sthāni dūre ca dṛṣṭeḥ gocara vibhramāt 	In such cases the near appearance of an actually remote object and the contrary (Miopia and Biopia) also should be ascribed to some deficiency in the range of vision (error of refraction in the crystalline lens) which incapacitates the patient from looking through the eye and hence from threading a needle.

dṛṣṭi madhya gate doṣe saḥ ekam manyate dvidhā dvidhā sthite tridhā paśyet bahudhā ca anavasthite 	A thing appears to the sight as if cut into two (bifurcated) when the deranged Doshas affect the middle part of the lens, and as triply divided and severed when the Doshas are scattered in two parts; while a multifarious image of the same object is the result of the manifold distributions of movability of the Doshas over the Drishti. 
timira ākhyaḥ sa vai doṣaḥ caturtham paṭalam gataḥ 	Loss of vision (Timira) results from the fact of the deranged bodily Doshas being confined within the fourth Patala (choroid) of the organ. 
ruṇaddhi sarvatas dṛṣṭim liṅganāśaḥ saḥ ucyate 	When the vision is completely obstructed by the aforesaid cause, it is called a case of Linga-nasha (blindness).

tathā raktena raktāni tamāṃsi vividhāni ca 	In a case of the Raktaja type of Timira, all objects appear red or envoloped in gloom, and they assume a greyish, blackish or variegated colour. 
bahudhā vā dvidhā vā api sarvāṇi eva samantataḥ hīna adhika aṅgāni athavā jyotīṃṣi api ca paśyati 	In a case of Sannipatika Timira, the outer world looks vareigated and confused, appears as doubled or trebled to the vision (of the patient), and stars and planets, either defective or supplied with additional limbs, seem to float about in the vision.

rakta jam maṇḍalam dṛṣṭau sthūla kāca anala prabham 	A circular patch (Mandala) tinged with a shade of bluish or bluish yellow colour and looking like fire or a piece of thick grass, is formed on the pupil owing to the diseased and aggravated condition of the blood (with pitta) in a case of Parimlayi. 
doṣa kṣayāt kadācid syāt svayam tatra ca darśanam 	In this case the patient is sometimes permitted to catch faint glimpses of the external objects owing to the spontaneous and occasional filtering away of the deranged Doshas obstructing the vision.

divā sa sūrya anugṛhīta cakṣuḥ īkṣeta rūpāṇi kapha alpa bhāvāt 	In consequence of this the patient is attacked with nocturnal blindness, being able to see only in the daytime owing to the (melting and) decrease of the deranged Kapha through the heat of the sun. 
śoka jvara āyāsa śiraḥ bhitāpaiḥ abhyāhatā yasya narasya dṛṣṭiḥ 	The external objects appear dusky or smoke-coloured when the sight is affected through grief, (high and protracted) fever, over-straining or excessive physical exercise, or injury to the head, etc.

vidyotate yena narasya dṛṣṭiḥ doṣa abhipannā nakulasya yadvat citrāṇi rūpāṇi divā sa paśyet sa vai vikāraḥ nakula āndhya saṃjñaḥ 	The form of occular affection in which the colour of Drishti (pupil) of a man affected by the Doshas resembles (and is found to emit (luminous) flashes like) that of a mungoose in consequence of which the external objects appear multi-coloured in the day time,[4] is called Nakulandhya. 
rujā avagāḍhā ca tam akṣi rogam gambhīrikā iti pravadanti tad jñāḥ 	The form of occular affection due to the action of the deranged Vayu, and in which the Drishti (pupil) is contracted and deformed and sinks into the socket, attended with an extreme pain in the affected parts, is called Gambhirika.

sannipāta jvaram kṛcchram asādhyam apare viduḥ 	An attack of Sannipataja fever can be cured only with the greatest difficulty, while others hold it to be almost incurable. 
nidrā upetam abhinyāsam kṣīṇam enam hata ojasam 	A case of Sannipataja fever attended with somnolence is called Abhinyasa, it is called Hataujasa when the vitality of the patient is greatly diminished and it is called Saunyasa when there is an innertness of the limbs. 
api jāgrat svapan jantuḥ tandrāluḥ ca pralāpavān saṃhṛṣṭa romā srasta aṅgaḥ manda saṃtāpa vedanaḥ 	When (in a case of Sannipataja fever), the Ojo-dhatu (one of the fundamental principles) of the organism being disturbed or agitated by the deranged and aggravated Pitta and Vayu, gives rise to shivering and numbness of limbs and makes the patient drop into fits of unconsciousness whether asleep or awake, and when there are somnolence delirious talks, horripilation, looseness of the limbs and slight pain (in the body)—this kind of fever is called Ojo-nirodhaja fever (due to an obstruction or an overwhelmed condition of the Ojo-dhatu) by the experts. 
saptame vidase prāpte daśame dvādaśe api vā punar dhorataraḥ bhūtvā praśamam yāti hanti vā 	The disease, (in such cases) finds aggravation on the seventh, the tenth or on the twelfth day[4] when the case takes either a favourable turn or ends in death.

kṛśānām jvara muktānām mithyā āhāra vihāriṇām doṣaḥ su alpaḥ api saṃvṛddhaḥ dehinām anila īritaḥ 	Even a small residue of the deranged bodily Doshas in a patient just cured of an attack of fever but still sufferring from weakness and indulging in injudicious regimen of diet and rule of conduct, is apt to be augmented and aggravated by the deranged Vayu of the body, and thus begets five different types of fever lodged in any of the five specific locations of Kapha[6]. 
satata anyedyuṣka tri ākhya cāturthān sa pralepakān 	These five types are known as the Satata, Anyedyushka, Tritiyaka, Caturthaka and the Pralepaka[7]. 
ahorātrāt ahorātrāt sthānāt sthānam prapadyate tatas ca āmāśayam prāpya doṣaḥ kuryāt jvaram nṛṇām 	The (residue of the) deranged Dosha of the body, shifting from one location of Kapha to the next in the course of the entire day and night, ultimately finds lodgment in the Amashaya (stomach) and thus brings on the virulent attack of (those) fevers. 
duścikitsyatamaḥ mandaḥ su kaṣṭaḥ dhātu śoṣa kṛt 	Of these the type known as the Pralepaka appears in cases of Shosha (consumption) and though its attak is a mild one, it puts almost insurmountable difficulties in the way of its cure, brings about a loss or waste of Dhatus (the seven fundamental principles of the organism) and thus ultimately ends in death.

aupatyake madya samudbhave ca hetum jvare pitta kṛtam vadanti 	A case of fever due to the abuse of any wine or ardent spirits as well as the one occuring in a low land at the foot of a mountain, should be supposed to involve a predominant action of the deranged and aggravated Pitta. 
pralepakam vāta balāsakam ca kapha adhika tvena vadanti tad jñāḥ 	A case of Pralepaka fever is due to the concerted action of the deranged and aggravated Vayu and Kapha, of which the action of the latter should be regarded as more dominant. 
mūrchā anubandhāḥ viṣamajvarāḥ ye prāyeṇa te dvandva samutthitāḥ tu 	Cases of Vishama fever ushered in by epileptic fits should be regarded as the result of the concerted action of any two deranged Doshas of the body. 
tvac sthau śleṣma anilau śītam ādau janayataḥ jvare 	The deranged Kapha and Vayu of the body, if located under the surface of the skin, produce cold (shivering) during the first stage of fever, while the deranged Pitta brings on the characteristic burning sensation at its latter stage after the subsidence of the deranged Kapha and Vayu. 
dvau etau dāha śīta ādī jvarau saṃsarga jau smṛtau 	Both these two types of fever are brought on through the combined action of two deranged Doshas of the body and of these two, the type which is ushered in by a burning sensation in the body is extremely hard to cure. 
dāha pūrvaḥ tayoḥ kaṣṭaḥ kṛcchra sādhyaḥ ca sa smṛtaḥ 	A case of continued fever resulting from an abnormal psychic condition (such as anger, grief, desire, etc.) or due to any blow or hurt is likewise hard to cure.

sa ca api viṣamaḥ deham na kadācid vimuñcati glāni gaurava kārśyebhyaḥ sa yasmāt na pramucyate 	This Vishama fever never finds complete remission, (but lurks in the deeper organic principles of the body) and produces a sense of physical langour and heaviness of the limbs as well as the characteristic emaciation. 
vege tu samatikrānte gataḥ ayam iti lakṣyate dhātu antara sthaḥ līna tvāt na saukṣmyāt upalabhyate alpa doṣa indhanaḥ kṣīṇaḥ kṣīṇa indhanaḥ iva analaḥ 	It is called Vishama-jvara because its abatement is always confounded with its cure and remission, and this confounding is due to the fact that the disease (fever) lies dormant in a very small degree in the deeper principles of the vital organism to be patent only at the slightest exciting cause, just as a feeble fire fed with an insufficient supply of fuel, becomes patent at the slightest exciting cause. 
doṣaḥ alpaḥ ahita saṃbhūtaḥ jvara utsṛṣṭasya vā punar dhātum anyatamam prāpya karoti viṣamajvaram 	Even a small residue of the deranged bodily Dosha, lurking in the system after the apparent cure of fever, is aggravated by a course of injudicious conduct and indifference to strict regimen of diet, and thus invites a fresh attack[9] which is known as the Vishama Jvara. 
satatam rasa rakta sthaḥ saḥ anyedyus piśita āśritaḥ 	A case of Santata (remittent or continuous) fever has its seat in the vitiated Rasa (serum) and blood[10] of the organism; while a case of Anyedyuh finds location in the contaminated flesh of the body. 
medaḥ gataḥ tṛtīye ahni tu asthi majja gataḥ punar 	The type known as the Tri-tiyaka (tertian-fever coming on every third day) affects the principle of Meda (fat), while the one called Caturthaka (quartan-fever coming on every fourth day) affects and is infiltrated into bones and marrow.

kecid bhūta abhiṣaṅga uttham bruvate viṣamajvaram 	Several authorities include cases of fever due to the malignant influence of evil spirits within the category of Vishama Jvara.

anyedyuṣkaḥ tu ahar rātrāt eka kālam pravartate tṛtīyakaḥ tṛtīye ahni caturthe ahni caturthakaḥ 	Fever of the Anyedyushka type comes on only once a day and one of the Tri-tiyaka type comes on every third i.e., on every alternate day, while a case of Caturthaka fever sets in every fourth day. 
vātena uddhūyamānaḥ tu yathā pūryeta sāgaraḥ vātena udīritāḥ tadvat doṣāḥ kurvanti vai jvarān 	Just as the ocean is overflown when its water is swollen up by the gusts of wind (Vayu), so the bodily Doshas are aggravated by the bodily Vayu, and give rise to different kinds of fever. 
vega hānau tat eva ambhaḥ tatra eva antar nilīyate doṣa vega udaye tadvat udīryeta jvaraḥ asya vai vega hānau praśāmyeta yathā ambhaḥ sāgare tathā 	Just as the water of the occean floods the shore at flow-tide and rolls back to its former place during ebb-tide, so fever being augmented by the deranged Doshas of the body, rushes out of its lurking place in the organism and manifests itself (or comes to the surface of the skin) during the hours of the specific aggravation of the Doshas, only to be driven back into the deeper tissues and vital principles of the body during the period of their specific abatement, or to be expelled from the organisim at the completion of their perfect assimilation in or elimination from the system. 
vividhena abhighātena jvaraḥ yaḥ saṃpravartate yathādoṣa prakopam tu tathā manyeta tam jvaram 	A case of fever due to any extraneous blow or injury should be treated in the light of its periodicity and aggravation or in other words the nature of the deranged bodily Doshas underlying, or involved in such a case should be ascertained from the periodicity of its aggravation.

dīpanam kapha vicchedi pitta vāta anulomanam 	Tepid (boiled) water is appetising and it tends to disintegrate the accumulation of Kapha and restores the deranged bodily Pitta and Vayu to their normal condition. 
kapha vāta jvara ārtebhyaḥ hitam uṣṇa ambu tṛṣ chidam 	The use of tepid water which allays thirst is highly efficacious in cases of fever due to the actions of the deranged bodily Kapha and Vayu, as it tends to cleanse the internal passages of the body and helps in the easy movement of the deranged bodily Doshas in the organism.

vṛddhaḥ atīva adhas sarati eṣa yasmāt vyādhim ghoram tam tu atīsāram āhuḥ 	This dangerous disease is named Atisara from the constant oozing out (Ati and Sarana) of the liquid fecal matter from the anus. 
ekaikaśas sarvaśas ca api doṣaiḥ śokena anyaḥ ṣaṣṭhaḥ āmena ca uktaḥ 	It is usually classified into six different types, viz., those due to the predominance of the deranged bodily Doshas severally involved therein, that due to the concerted action of the three Doshas, one due to grief and that due to the indigested mucous accumulations (Ama) in the intestines. 
kecid prāhuḥ na eka rūpa prakāram na eva iti evam kāśi rājaḥ tu avocat|| 	Some authorities hold that Atisara is of many kinds but the holy Dhanvantari, on the contrary, holds that it is not so but that the physical conditions of a diarrheic patient undergo changes and become manifold.

iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām uttaratantrāntargate nāma (prathamaḥ adhyāyaḥ | 	Thus ends the sixtieth chapter of the Uttara-Tantra in the Sushruta-Samhita which deals with the (symptoms and) treatment of the disease brought on through super human influences. 
āditaḥ ( ṣaṣṭitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ||60|| ekaṣaṣṭitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ atha atas apasmārapratiṣedham adhyāyam vyākhyāsyāmaḥ|| 	Now we shall discourse on the chapter which deals with the (symptoms and) medical treatment of Apasmara (Apasmara-Pratishedha). 
smṛtiḥ bhūta artha vijñānam apaḥ ca parivarjane 	The word “Smriti” signifies the faculty of past sense-perceptions and (the prefix) “Apa” denotes the privation (of any object or attribute). 
apasmāraḥ iti proktaḥ tatas ayam vyādhiḥ antakṛt 	Hence, this disease (in which an individual loses the faculty of past cognitions) is termed Apasmara (Epilepsy) and it turns fatal. 
rajaḥ tamaḥ abhibhūtānām gacchatām ca rajasvalām tathā kāma bhaya udvega krodha śoka ādibhiḥ bhṛśam cetasi abhihate puṃsām apasmāraḥ abhijāyate 	Excessive, inadequate and improper attention to the objects of the sense as well as to their actions, partaking of filthy, impure, incompatible and uncongenial articles of fare and regimen of conduct, repression of any natural urging of the body or aggravation of the Rajas and Tamas (nescience), or going in unto a woman in her menses, or indulgence in amorous fancies, fright, anxiety, anger, or grief, etc., leads to an aggravation of the bodily Doshas which in their turn affect the mind (Cetas) very greatly and give rise to Apasmara. 
rajaḥ tamaḥ parīteṣu mūḍhaḥ bhrāntena cetasā 	The sense-carrying Srotas (channels) of the body overwhelmed by the concerted action of the deranged Doshas bring in a predominance of Rajas and Tamas (Nescience) causing the patient unconscious and forgetful of all past memories. 
vikṣipan hasta pādam ca vijihma bhrūḥ vilocanaḥ 	He writhes in agony and throws his hands and legs in convulsive jerks with contracted eyes (D. 
dantān khādan vaman phenam vivṛta akṣaḥ patet kṣitau 	He gnashes his teeth, with foams at the mouth, etc., and falls to the ground with open eyes, the consciousness returning a short while after. 
saḥ apasmāraḥ iti proktaḥ sa ca dṛṣṭaḥ caturvidhaḥ vāta pitta kaphaiḥ nṛṇām caturthaḥ sannipātataḥ 	The disease is called Apasmara which is classified into four distinct types—vis., Vataja, Pittaja, Kaphaja and Sannipataja. 
vepamānaḥ daśan dantān śvasan phenam vaman api 	lock-jaw, laboured breathing and foaming at the mouth. 
tṛṣ tāpa sveda mūrchā ārtaḥ dhunvan aṅgāni vihvalaḥ 	Fainting is excited by a terror of being seized by a yellow and fierce-looking being in the Pittaja type which is further marked by thirst, increased heat of the body, perspiration, fainting, mild tremor of the limbs and restlessness. 
śīta hṛllāsa nidrā ārtaḥ patan bhūmau vaman kapham 	Where the patient is excited by a fancied dread as if a supernatural being of white colour is coming to apprehend him, it is a case of the Kaphaja type which is moreover characterised by the exhibition of such symptoms as shivering, nausea, sleepiness, falling prostrate on the ground and vomiting of mucus. 
hṛdi todaḥ tṛṣ utkledaḥ triṣu api eteṣu saṃkhyayā 	Pain in the heart, thirst and nausea are the specific characteristics of the three types respectively. 
pralāpaḥ kūjanam kleśaḥ pratyekam tu bhavet iha 	But delirious talk and the making of indistinct and moaning sounds are present in all the types The specific features of all the three foregoing types manifest themselves in concert in a case of Sannipatika type. 
sarva liṅga samavāyaḥ sarva doṣa prakopa je animitta āgamāt vyādheḥ gamanāt akṛte api ca 	The sudden appearance of the disease without any apparent cause and also its sudden and spontaneous disappearance after a short while without any apparent treatment, have induced several medical authorities to hold that Apasmara is not due to any (aggravation of the) Dosha. 
krama upayogāt doṣāṇām kṣaṇika tvāt tathā eva ca|| 	Several authorities, on the contrary, have described, on the authority of other works on the subject, the gradual aggravation of the (suddenly) deranged Doshas as well as the concomitant symptoms of the disease in its various phases with the spontaneous and speedy nature of its abatement (though only temporary). 
śaradi pratirohanti tathā vyādhi samudbhavaḥ sthāyinaḥ kecid alpena kālena abhipravardhitāḥ 	Hence it may be presumed that as seeds sprout in autumn only, when the rains make the ground ready to receive them, the shortness of time being counted as no factor potent enough to obstruct the process (of sprouting), so the deranged Doshas of the body though gradually aggravated bring on, as a matter of fact, an attack of Apasmara with all its concomitant symptoms, only under conditions favourable to its appearance which may, however, be short and transitory in its duration. 
apasmāraḥ mahā vyādhiḥ tasmāt doṣa jaḥ eva tu 	Hence this dreadful Apasmara is certainly a disease of idiopathic origin. 
tasya kāryaḥ vidhiḥ sarvaḥ yaḥ unmādeṣu vakṣyate 	Medicinal agents and remedies to be mentioned in connection with insanity (Unmada) may be as well employed in the present disease. 
upayogaḥ graha uktānām yogānām tu viśeṣataḥ 	Medicinal measures and compounds mentioned under the head of possession by the Grahas are also specially beneficial in the present disease.

tīkṣṇaiḥ ubhayatas bhāgaiḥ śiraḥ ca api viśodhayet 	Strong medicinal errhines (Shiro-virecana) as well as strong emetics and purgatives should be administered.

tat bāla vṛddha vanitā mṛdavaḥ tu pītvā glānim parām samupayānti bala kṣayam ca 	A medicine not applied with any food (but applied by itself with or without any vehicle) would have greater effect and would soon and certainly destroy the disease it is applied in; but a medicine should not be applied in this way to a child, an old man, a young woman and persons of mild temperament, for it is likely to produce lassitude and weaken the patient (in such cases). 
prāgbhaktam nāma yat prāc bhaktasya upayujyate 	A medicine taken (in an empty stomach) just before a meal, is called Pragbhakta. 
śīghram vipākam upayāti balam na hiṃsyāt anna āvṛtam na ca muhur vardanāt nireti prāk bhakta sevitam atha auṣadham etat eva dadyāt ca vṛddha śiśu bhīru kṛśa aṅganābhyaḥ 	A medicine taken in such a manner, is easily digested, does not lead to any diminution of strength and is not ejected out of the mouth owing to its being covered over with the meal, On the other hand, taken before the meal, it adds to the bodily strength and proves the most convenient form in which a medicine can be administered to old men, infants, females and persons of timid disposition.

madhyebhaktam nāma yat madhye bhaktasya pīyate 	A medicine taken in the course of a meal is called Madhyebhakta. 
madhye tu pītam apahanti avisāri bhāvāt ye madhya deham abhibhūya bhavanti rogāḥ 	A medicine taken in this manner fails to be diffused all through the organism and hence proves beneficial only in those ailments which are confined to the middle part of the body.

sāmudgam nāma yad bhaktasya ādau ante ca pīyate 	A medicine taken at the beginning and again at the close of a meal is called Samudga. 
doṣe dvidhā pravisṛte tu samudga saṃjñam ādi antayoḥ yat aśanasya niṣevyate tu 	This form of administration is most beneficial in cases where the deranged bodily Doshas take both the (upward and downward) courses.

iti suśrutasaṃhitāyām uttaratantre tantrabhūṣaṇa adhyāyeṣu svasvavṛttādhyāyaḥ nāma (dvitīyaḥ adhyāyaḥ | āditaḥ ( catuḥṣaṣṭitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ||64|| pañcaṣaṣṭitamaḥ adhyāyaḥ 	Thus ends the sixty-fourth chapter in the Uttara-tantra of the Sushruta-Samhita which deals with the Rules of Hygiene.

nirṇayaḥ 	They are— 
iti atrāsām tantra yuktīnām kim prayojanam ucyate vākya yojanam artha yojanam ca bhavanti ca atra ślokāḥ 	What is the necessity of the use of these technical terms (Tantra-Yukti)? The answer is—For connecting words together, i.e., making up sentences and giving a sense or meaning to them. 
asat vādi prayuktānām vākyānām pratiṣedhanam sva vākya siddhiḥ api ca kriyate tantra yuktitaḥ 	By the use of technical terms in a scientific treatise the points of argument of the opposite party are frustrated and the points of one’s own argument are established. 
vyāktāḥ na uktāḥ tu ye hi arthāḥ līnāḥ ye ca api anirmalāḥ 	The meanings of the words, whether clearly used or not, whether direct or indirect, or partially used, if there is any such, in the treatise are also made distinct (by the use of the technical terms). 
yathā ambu javanasya arkaḥ pradīpaḥ veśmanaḥ yathā prabodhasya prakāśa artham tathā tantrasya yuktayaḥ 	Just as the sun shows a cluster of lotus and a lighted lamp (the inside of) a room at their best, so the technical terms used in a treatise clearly show i.e., explain the intended meaning.

yena vākyam yujyate sa yogaḥ 	The term “Yoga” is the union of words or sentences together.

iti etayoḥ ca dhātvoḥ aneka arthayoḥ prayogāt,tatra pūrva apara yogam upalabhya pratipattiḥ bhavati āyurveda utpattim ayam vivakṣuḥ iti 	we shall discourse on the origin of the ‘Veda’, the use of the word “Veda” would put the hearer at a loss to understand which of the Vedas is going to be discoursed on, for there are several Vedas, vis, Rigveda, etc. But when we try to understand the expression in connection with the previous or subsequent use of the expression—for the root ‘vid’ may mean either ‘Vicharana’ (discussion) or ‘Vindati’ (to get)—we can afterwards come to the conclusion that the subject to be discoursed upon is the origin of Ayurveda. This is what is meant by the term Padartha. 
yat anyat uktam anya artha sādhakam bhavati sa hetvarthaḥ 	Hetvartha is the meaning indirectly implied by a word.

dviṣaṣṭiḥ doṣa bhedāḥ ye purastāt parikīrtitāḥ kati tatra ekaśas jñeyāḥ dviśas vā api athavā triśas 	The question is—It has been already said that there are sixty-two[1] varieties of the Doshas, but how are they divided when taken one, two or all the three at a time? 2—3.

trayaḥ eva pṛthak doṣāḥ dviśaḥ nava sama adhikaiḥ 	The three Doshas separately have three combinations, viz., where one of the Doshas is aggravated and the other two are in their normal state. 
trayodaśa adhika eka dvi sama madhya ulbaṇaiḥ triśas 	Taken two at a time, both of them aggravated, whether equally or unequally (with the third in its normal state), the number of combinations would be nine; while the number of combinations would be thirteen if they are taken three at a time—all of them aggravated, both equally and unequally (thus making twenty-five in all with the aggravated Doshas).
