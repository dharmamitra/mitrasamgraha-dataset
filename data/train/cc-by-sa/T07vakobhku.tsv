It is not movement because all conditioned things are momentary, since they perish: on the other hand, 68 Abhidharmakosa Chapter 4 nothing does not perish without a cause and the creative cause would be at the same time destructive.
na kasyacidahetoḥ syāt hetuḥ syācca vināśakaḥ / dvigrāhyaṃ syāt na cāṇau tat vāgvijñaptistu vāgdhvaniḥ // 	It would be perceived by two organs.  Shape does not exist in an atom.  Vocal vijñapti is vocal sound. T: (3a) Without causes nothing could [disappear]. | (3b) The cause [for the arising of an attribute] would also be the agent of [its] disappearance. | (3c) [How] would [it] be directly perceivable through a second [sense organ?] (3c) [But shape] does not exist down to its atoms, either. | (3d) Furthermore, vocal informing is speech (vagdhvani). 69 Abhidharmakosa Chapter 4
trividhāmalarūpoktivṛddhayakurvatpathādibhiḥ / kṣaṇādūrdhvamavijñaptiḥ kāmāptātītabhūtajā // 	Scripture says that rūpa is of three types and that there is a pure rūpa; there is increase of merit; and there is a course of action for him who is not concerned with himself, etc.  From the first moment, the avijñapti of Kāmadhātu arises derived from the past primary elements. T: (4ab) Because (1) the three categories [of form] and (2) flux-free form have been stated, [and because of] (3) increase, (4) the path [of karman] of one who does not perform [the deed himself] and so forth. | (4cd) After the [first] moment, the noninforming that belongs to the desire realm arises from past elements.
svāni bhūtānyupādāya kāyavākkarma sāsravam / anāsravaṃ yatra jātaḥ avijñaptiranupāttikā // 	When impure, bodily and vocal action derive from the primary elements of the sphere to which they belong.  When they are pure, they are from the primary elements of the sphere to which the person who has produced them belongs.  The avijñapti is not integral to the organism; it is also an outflowing; it belongs solely to living beings. T: (5ab) The bodily or the vocal karman that is flux driven [arisen] depending on elements of [its] own [stage]. | (5c) That which is flux-free [arises depending on those of the stage] where the person was born. | (5d) The noninforrning is unattached (anupattika),
naiḥṣyandikī ca sattvākhyā niṣyandopāttabhūtajā / samādhijau pacayikānupāttābhinnabhūtajā // 	[6] Not of absorption, it derives from the primary elements which are an outflowing, which are integral to the organism, which are differentiated. Arisen from absorption, it derives from nondifferentiated primary elements, not integral to the organism, and increase. T: (6a) is cognate (naisyandika), belongs to sentient beings (sattvakhya). | (6b) It arises from elements that are cognate and attached. | (6cd) That which arises in concentration (samadhija) arises from developed (aupacayika) unattached and unspecialized [elements].
nāvyākṛtāstyavijñaptiḥ tridhānvyat aśubhaṃ punaḥ / kāme rūpe 'pyavijñaptiḥ vijñaptiḥ savicārayoḥ // 	The avijñapti is never neutral.  Other actions are of three types.  Bad action exists in Kāmadhātu.  Avijñapti also exists in Rūpadhātu.  Vijñapti exists in the two spheres where there is vicāra. T: (7a) There is no neutral noninforming. | (7b1 ) Other [karman] is three-fold. (7b2C l) Furthermore, there lS the impure in [the realm of] desire. | (7c2) There is also the noninforming in form realm. | (7d)The informing is in the two [stages] where there is deliberation (vicara).
kāme 'pi nivṛtā nāsti samutthānamasadyataḥ / paramārthaśubho mokṣaḥ svato mūlahyrapatrapāḥ // 	The vijñapti termed nivṛta is also missing in Kāmadhātu.  Because the cause which produces it is absent.  Deliverance is absolute good.  The roots, respect and fear, are good in and of themselves.
saṃprayogeṇa tadyuktāḥ samutthā nāt kriyādayaḥ / viparyayeṇākuśalaṃ paramāvyākṛte dhruve // 	That which is associated [with the roots, etc.], is good through association.  Actions, etc. are good by reason of their original cause.  Evil is the contrary.  Two entities are neutral in the absolute sense.
samutthānaṃ dvidhā hetutatkṣaṇotthānasaṃjñitam / pravartakaṃ tayorādyaṃ dvitīyamanuvartakam // 	That which gives rise (samutthāna) is of two types, which are known as hetusamutthāna and tatkṣaṇasamutthāna.  Which are respectively first setter into motion and second mover.
pravartakaṃ dṛṣṭiheyaṃ vijñānam ubhayaṃ punaḥ / mānasaṃ bhāvanāheyaṃ pañcakaṃ tvanuvartakam // 	73 Abhidharmakosa Chapter 4  The consciousness to be abandoned through Seeing is solely agent.  The manas susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation is twofold.  The five are solely mover.
pravartake śubhādau hi syāttridhāpyanuvartakam / tulyaṃ muneḥ śubhaṃ yāvat nobhayaṃ tu vipākajam // 	From a good agent, etc., a mover of three types.  With regard to the Muni, mover of the same type.  Or good.  That which arises from retribution is neither of the two.
avijñaptistridhā jñeyā saṃvarāsaṃvaretarā / saṃvaraḥ prātimokṣākhyo dhyānajo 'nāsravastathā // 	Avijñapti is threefold, discipline (saṁvara), un-discipline (asaṁvara), and different from either discipline or un-discipline.  Prātimokṣa discipline, pure discipline, discipline arising from dhyāna. 74 Abhidharmakosa Chapter 4
aṣṭadhā prātimokṣākhyaḥ dravyatastu caturvidhaḥ / liṅgato nāmasaṃcārāt pṛthak te cāvirodhinaḥ // 	The Prātimokṣa is of eight types.  In substance however, the Prātimokṣa is of four types.  The name changes with the gender.  [The disciplines exist] separately.  But they do not contradict one another.

svaparārthobhayārthāya nobhayārthāya dīyate / tadviśeṣaḥ punardātṛvastukṣetraviśeṣataḥ // 	Giving is beneficial to oneself, to others, to both or neither.  Giving is excellent by the excellence of the giver, of the object given, and of the field.

dṛṣṭitrayādviparyāsacatuṣkaṃ viparītataḥ / nitīraṇāt samāropāt saṃjñācitte tu tadvaśāt // 	One distinguishes four errors within the three views.  Reflective judgment and affirmation because they allow complete error.  Thought and idea are termed “error” by reason of view.

svabhūmyuparamo mārgaḥ ṣaḍbhūminavabhūmikaḥ / tadgocarāṇāṃ viṣayo mārgo hyanyo 'nyahetukaḥ // 	The extinction of their own bhūmi is the object of the anuśayas which have extinction for their sphere; the Path with its six or nine bhūmis, is the object of the anuśayas which have the Path for their sphere, for the Paths depend on one another.
na rāgastasya varjyatvāt na dveṣo 'napakārataḥ / na māno na parāmarśau śāntaśuddhyagrabhāvataḥ // 	Lust does not bear on pure dharmas, because lust should be rejected.  Anger does not, because pure dharmas do not do evil.  Egotism and the two esteemings do not, because pure dharmas are calm, pure, and excellent.
sarvatragā anuśayāḥ sakalāmanuśerate / svabhūmimālambanataḥ svanikāyamasarvagāḥ // 	Universal anuśayas, relative to the object, become anuśayana in all their spheres; the nonuniversals, in their one category.
nānāsravordhvaviṣayāḥ asvīkārādvipakṣataḥ / yena yaḥ saṃprayuktastu sa tasmin saṃprayogataḥ // 	116 Abhidharmakosa Chapter 5  Not the anuśayas that bear on the pure dharmas or a higher sphere, because their object is not “made one’s own” and opposes the anuśayas.  Any anuśaya which is associated with a certain dharma becomes anuśaya through association with this dharma.
ūrdhvamavyākṛtāḥ sarve kāme satkāyadarśanam / antagrāhaḥ sahābhyāṃ ca mohaḥ śeṣāstvihāśubhāḥ // 	All the “higher” dhyānas are morally neutral.  The belief in a self, a belief in extremes, and ignorance are neutral in Kāmadhātu.  The other anuśayas, here, are bad.
kāme 'kuśalamūlāni rāgapratighamūḍhayaḥ / trīṇyakuśalamūlāni tṛṣṇāvidyā matiśca sā // 	Lust, anger and mūḍi, in Kāmadhātu, are roots of evil.  Three roots, desire, ignorance, and mati (that is, prajñā) are neutral.  The others are not roots, because their modality is of duality and elevation.
dvidhordhvavṛtternāto 'nyau catvāryeveti bāhyakāḥ / tṛṣṇādṛṅmānamohāste dhyāyitritvādavidyayā // 	Four, [say the Aparāntakas]: desire, views, egotism, and delusion which are neutral; in fact there are three contemplations based on ignorance.

sarvatrānāgatairebhirmānasaiḥ svādhvike paraiḥ / ajaiḥ sarvatra śeṣaistu sarvaiḥ sarvatra saṃyutaḥ // 	One is bound to all objects by the same future kleśas, since they are mental states.  One is bound to the object of their time period by the same future kleśas, since they are not mental states.  Not destined to arise, one is bound everywhere by the same.  One is bound everywhere by the others, whatever they are.
sarvakālāstitā uktatvāt dvayāt sadviṣayāt phalāt / tadastivādāt sarvāstivādā iṣṭāḥ caturvidhāḥ // 	The dharmas exist in the three time periods.  Because the Blessed One has said it.  Because mental consciousness preceeds from two.  Because it has an object.  And because the past bears a result.  He who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods is held to be a Sarvāstivādin.
te bhāvalakṣaṇāvasthānyathānyathikasaṃjñitāḥ / tṛtīyaḥ śobhanaḥ adhvānaḥ kāritreṇa vyavasthitāḥ // 	[26]  There are four types of Sarvāstivādins accordingly as they teach a difference in existence (bhāva), a difference in characteristic, a difference in condition, and mutual difference.  The third is the best.  The three time periods are proven by reason of their activity.
kiṃ vighnaṃ tatkathaṃ nānyat adhvāyogaḥ tathā sataḥ / ajātanaṣṭatā kena gambhīrā khalu dharmatā // 	What is opposed [to the activity of a dharma?]  How can activity be past, etc.?  But it is not other than the dharma.  The time periods are no longer justified.  Existing in the same manner, how can it be non-arisen or destroyed?  The nature of things is indeed profound.
prahīṇe duḥkhadṛggheye saṃyuktaḥ śeṣasarvagaiḥ / prāk prahīṇe prakare ca śeṣaistadviṣayairmalaiḥ // 	When that which is to be abandoned through the Seeing of Suffering is abandoned, the ascetic remains in connection with it from the fact of the universal defilements; when the first category is abandoned, he remains in connection with it from the fact of the other defilements which have it as their object.
duḥkhahetudṛgabhyāsapraheyāḥ kāmadhātujāḥ / svakatrayaikarūpāptāmalavijñānagocarāḥ // 	Abandoned through the Seeing of Suffering and Arising, abandoned through Meditation, the dharmas in Kāmadhātu are the sphere of the three consciousnesses of this sphere, of one consciousness of Rūpadhātu and the pure consciousness.
svakādharatrayordhvaikāmalānāṃ rūpadhātujāḥ / ārūpyajāstridhātvātpatrayānāsravagocarāḥ // 	The same three categories of dharmas in Rūpadhātu are the object of three consciousnesses of Rūpadhātu, three of Kāmadhātu, one of Ārūpyadhātu and the pure consciousness.  The same categories of dharmas in Ārūpyadhātu are the objects of the three consciousnesses of the three spheres and pure consciousness.
nirodhamārgadṛggheyāḥ sarve svādhikagocarāḥ / anāsravāstridhātvantyatrayānāsravagocarāḥ // 	The dharmas abandoned through the Seeing of Extinction and the Path are all the objects of the same consciousness with the addition of the consciousness of their own category.  The pure dharmas are the object of the last three consciousnesses of the three spheres and of pure consciousness.
dvidhā sānuśayaṃ kliṣṭamakliṣṭamanuśāyakaiḥ / mohākāṅkṣā tato mithyādṛṣṭiḥ satkāyadṛktataḥ // 	The defiled mind is sānuśaya in two ways; the non-defiled mind solely from the fact of the anuśayas which lodge therein.  From moha, there is doubt.  From whence false views. 32e. From whence a belief in a self;
tato 'ntagrahaṇaṃ tasmācchīlāmarśaḥ tato dṛśaḥ / rāgaḥ svadṛṣṭau mānaśca dveṣo 'nyatra ityanukramaḥ // 	From whence a belief in the extremes;  From whence the esteeming of morality and ascetic practices.  From whence the esteeming of bad views.  From whence lust and pride relative to one’s own views; 33e. And hatred with respect to another. 33f. Such is the order.
aprahīṇādanuśayādviṣayāt pratyupasthitāt / ayoniśo manaskārāt kleśaḥ saṃpūrṇakāraṇaḥ // 	Kleśas [with complete causes] arise from the non-abandonment of the anuśaya, from the presence of their object, and from erroneous judgment.  With complete causes.

avyākṛtāntarmukhā hi te samāhitabhūmikāḥ / ata ekīkṛtāḥ mūlamavidyetyāsravaḥ pṛthak // 	They are morally neutral, proceed inwards, and belong to the stage of absorption: this is why they are put together.  Ignorance is the root: it is thus said to constitute a separate cankerous influence.
tathaughayogā dṛṣṭīnāṃ pṛthagbhāvastu pāṭavāt / nāsraveṣvasahāyānāṃ na kilāsyānukūlatā // 	So too for the floods and the yokes. But views constitute a separate flood and a separate yoke by reason of their acuteness.  They are not a separate cankerous influence, because, without companions, they are not favorable to installation.
yathoktā eva sāvidyā dvidhā dṛṣṭivivecanāt / upādānāni avidyā tu grāhikā ne ti miśritā // 	So too the upādānas (the clingings), by placing ignorance [with the first two] and by dividing the dṛṣṭis into two.  Ignorance is not the grasper; like clinging, it is mixed with the other anuśayas.
aṇavo 'nugatāścaite dvidhā cāpyanuśerate / anubadhnanti yasmācca tasmādanuśayāḥ smṛtāḥ // 	They are atomic; they adhere; they nourish themselves in two ways; they continually blind: this is why they are termed anuśayas.
āsayantyāsravantyete haranti śleṣayantyatha / upagṛhṇanti cetyeṣāmāsravādiniruktayaḥ // 	They fix and they flow, they carry away, they attach, they seize: such is the etymology of the words āsravas, etc.
saṃyojanādibhedena punaste pañcadhoditāḥ / dravyāmarśana sāmānyaddṛṣṭī saṃyojanāntaram // 	There are said to be five types by reason of their division into conections, etc.  Two views constitute separate connection by reason of their equal number of things, and by reason of their common characteristics of esteeming.
ekāntākuśalaṃ yasmāt svatantraṃ cobhayaṃ yataḥ / īrṣyāmātsaryameṣūktaṃ pṛthak saṃyojanadvayam // 	Envy and avarice are each a connection because, among the wrappings, they are at one and the same time completely bad and independent.
pañcadhāvarabhāgīyaṃ dvābhyāṃ kāmānatikramaḥ / tribhistu punarāvṛttiḥ mukhamūlagrahāttrayam // 	Five are inferior.  Two cause on not to get out of Kāmadhātu; three cause one to return there.  Three, because they make up the gate and the root.
agantukāmatāmārgavibhramo mārgasaṃśayaḥ / ityantarāyā mokṣasya gamane 'tastrideśanā // 	Three are indicated because three things create an obstacle to arriving at deliverance: a nondesire to go, error with respect to the Path, and doubt with respect to the Path.
pañcadhaivordhvabhāgīyaṃ dvau rāgau rūpyarūpijau / auddhatyamānamohāśca vidvaśād bandhanatrayam // 	Five are “superior”, namely two lusts, those which arise from Rūpahdhātu and from Ārūpadhātu, namely dissipation, pride and ignorance.  There are three bonds by reason of sensation.

One acquires them, undefiled, through detachment.  One acquires them, defiled, through falling and through birth.
tṛtīyādyāvadūrdhvādho 'nāsravānantaraṃ śubham / utpadyate tathā śuddhāt kliṭaṃ cāpi svabhūmikam // 	After the undefiled, up to the third sphere above or below, there arises the good.  The same after the pure, by adding the defiled of its sphere.
kliṣṭāt svaṃ śuddakaṃ kliṣṭaṃ evaṃ cādharaśuddhakam / cyutau tu śuddhakāt kliṣṭaṃ sarvaṃ kliṣṭāttu nottaram // 	After the defiled, the pure and the defiled of its sphere.  And the pure of a lower sphere.  At death, after the pure, the defiled of any types can arise.  After the defiled, nothing higher.
caturdhā śuddhakaṃ hānabhāgīyādi yathākramam / kleśotpattisvabhūmyūrdhvānāsravānuguṇaṃ hi tat // 	The pure absorption is of four types, of falling, etc.  In order, they are suitable to the arising of the defilements, to its own sphere, to a higher sphere, to the undefiled.
dve trīṇi trīṇi caikaṃ ca hāna bhāgādyanantaram / gatvāgamya dvidhā bhūmīraṣṭau śliṣṭai kalaṅghitāḥ // 	After the absorption of falling, etc., two, three, three, one. 18c- Going and coming in two ways over the eight spheres, in immediate succession, by passing over one sphere, going to the third sphere of a different type, is called “transitional absorption”.
vyutkrāntakasamāpattirvisabhāgatṛtīyagā / svādhobhūmyāśrayā eva dhyānārūpyāḥ vṛthādharam // 	The dhyāna and ārūpya absorptions have for their support (āśraya) beings of their own spheres or of a lower sphere.  A lower absorption has no usefulness.
āryākiṃcanyasāṃmukhyāt bhavāgre tvāsravakṣayaḥ / satṛṣṇāḥ svabhavālambāḥ dhyānaṃ sadviṣayaṃ śubham // 	But, in Bhavāgra, it is by entering the Āryan absorption of Ākiṁcanya that one destroys the defilements.  Associated with thirst, absorption has its own existence (bhava) for its object.  Pure absorption has all that exists for its object.
na maulāḥ kuśalārūpyāḥ sāsravādharagocarāḥ / anāsraveṇa hīyante kleśāḥ sāmantakena ca // 	The pure Ārūpya absorptions of the principal spheres do not have lower defiled absorptions for their object.  The defilements are abandoned through the undefiled absorptions.  And also by means of the sāmantakas, (likewise pure).
aṣṭau sāmantakānyeṣāṃ śuddhāduḥkhāsukhāni hi / ārya cādyaṃ tridhā kecit atarka dhyānamantaram // 	There are eight sāmantakas in the basic absorptions.  They are pure; they possess the sensation of equanimity.  The first is also Āryan.  Some say that it is threefold.  Dhyānāntara is without vitarka.
tridhā aduḥkhāsukhaṃtacca mahābrahmaphalaṃ ca tat / savitarkavicāro 'dhaḥsamādhiḥ parato 'dvayaḥ // 	To three;  It has the sensation of equanimity.  It has Mahābrahmā for its result. 23d-e. Up to it, samādhi exists with vitarka and vicāra; 23e. Beyond, samādhi exists without either.
ānimittaḥ samākāraiḥ śūnyatānātmaśūnyataḥ / pravartate apraṇihitaḥ satyākārairataḥ paraiḥ // 	The absence of characteristics has the aspect of the Tranquil.  Emptiness has the aspects of emptiness and non-self.  The absence of intention is associated with the other Truths.
śuddhāmalāḥ nirmalāstu te vimokṣamukhatrayam / śūnyatāśunyatādyākhyāstrayo 'parasamādhayaḥ // 	Pure or immaculate (amala).  Immaculate, they are the three gates to deliverance (vimokṣamukha).  There are also three other absorptions (samādhi) called “emptiness of emptiness”, etc.
ālambete aśaikṣaṃ dvau śūnyataścāpyanityataḥ / ānimittānimittastu śāntato 'saṃkhyayā kṣayam // 	The first two refer to the Aśaikṣa under the aspects of emptiness and impermanence.  The absence of characteristics in the absence of characteristics has for its object extinction (kṣayam) not attained through conscious effort, and considers it as tranquil (śānta).
sāsravāḥ nṛṣu akopyasya saptasāmantavarjitāḥ / samādhibhāvanā dhyānaṃ subhamādyaṃ sukhāya hi // 	Defiled (lit: possessing the defilements, sāsrava).  Among humans,  Among the Unshakeable Ones.  With the exception of the seven sāmantakas.  The First good Dhyāna is the cultivation of the absorption that has for its result happiness;
darśanāyākṣyabhijñeṣṭā dhībhedāya prayogajāḥ / vajropamo 'ntye yo dhyāne sāsravakṣayabhāvanā // 	The supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) of the eye has sight for its result.  The cultivation of good arisen from exercise has comprehension for its result.  The absorption likened to a Vajra (Vajropamasamadhi) of the Fourth Dhyāna has the extinction of the defilements for its result.
apramāṇāni catvāri vyāpādādivipakṣataḥ / maitryadveṣaḥ api karuṇā muditā sumanaskatā // 	The Immeasurables (apramāṇas) are four in number.  Because they oppose ill-will, etc.,  Goodwill is the absence of hatred.  So too compassion. 29e. Joy is satisfaction.
upekṣālobhaḥ ākāraḥ sukhitā duḥkhitā vata / modantāmiti sattvācca kāmasattvāstu gocaraḥ // 	Equanimity is the absence of desire.  Their aspects are happiness, unhappiness, joy, and beings.  They have the living beings of Kāmadhātu for their sphere. 200 Abhidharmakosa Chapter 8
dhyānayormuditā anyāni ṣaṭ su kecittu pañcasu / na taiḥ prahāṇaṃ nṛṣveva janyante tryanvito dhruvam // 	Joy in two Dhyānas.  The others in six spheres.  Or, according to some, in five.  There is no abandoning through the Immeasurables. 31e. One produces them among humans. 31f. He necessarily possesses three.
aṣṭau vimokṣāḥ prathamāvaśubhā dhyānayordvayoḥ / tṛtīyo 'ntye sa cālobhaḥ śubhārūpyāḥ samāhitāḥ // 	The Deliverances are eight in number.  The first two are meditations on loathsome things;  They are in two Dhyānas.  The Third in the last Dhyāna.  It is the absence of desire.  They are good Ārūpyas and absorptions.
nirodhastu samāpattiḥ sūkṣmasūkṣmādanantaram / svaśuddhakādharāryeṇa vyutthānaṃ cetasā tataḥ // 	The absorption of extinction (nirodhasamāpatti).  Immediately after a subtle-subtle mind.  Going out into a pure mind of the sphere of the same absorption, or into a lower Āryan mind.
kāmāptadṛśyaviṣayāḥ prathamāḥ ye tvarūpiṇaḥ / te 'nvayajñānapakṣordhvasvabhūduḥkhādigocarāḥ // 	The first ones have for their object the visible things of Kāmadhātu.  As for those that are non-material, all that which belongs to the Knowledge, the Suffering of their sphere and of a higher sphere, etc.
abhibhvāyatanānyaṣṭau dvayamādyavimokṣavat / dve dvitīyavat anyāni punaḥ śubhavimokṣavat // 	The Dominant Āyatanas (abhibhvāyatanas) are eight in number.  Two are like the First Deliverance.  The following two are like the Second.  And the last four are like the Third Deliverance.
daśa kṛtsnāni alobhāṣṭau dhyāne 'ntye gocaraḥ punaḥ / kāmāḥ dve śuddhākārūpye svacatuḥskandhagocare // 	There are ten All-Encompassing Āyatanas (kṛtsnāyatanas).  Eight are the absence of desire.  They belong to the last Dhyāna.  They have Kāmadhātu for their object. 36e. Two are pure ārūpya. 36f. They have the four skandhas of their sphere for their object.
nirodha uktaḥ vairāgyaprayogāptaṃ tu śeṣitam / tridhātvāśrayamārūpyasaṃjñaṃ śeṣaṃ manuṣyajam // 	Extinction has been explained.  The others are obtained either through detachment or through cultivation.  The qualities of Ārūpyadhātu are obtained by beings of the Three Dhātus; the others, only by humans.
hetukarmabālāddhātvorārupyotpādanaṃ dvayoḥ / dhyānānāṃ rūpadhātau tu tābhyāṃ dharmatayāpi ca // 	In two spheres, it is through the power of cause and of action (karma) that one produces the absorption of Ārūpyadhātu.  In Rūpadhātu, it is through these two powers, and also be reason of the nature of things, that one produces the dhyānas.
saddharmo dvividhaḥ śāsturāgamādhigamātmakaḥ / dhātārastasya vaktāraḥ pratipattāra eva ca // 	The nature of the Good Law of the Master is twofold, āgama and adhigama.  Those who preach it and who cultivate it support it. 204 Abhidharmakosa Chapter 8
kāśmīravaibhāṣikanītisiddhaḥ prāyo mayāyaṃ kathito 'bhidharmaḥ / yaddurguhītaṃ tadihāsmadāgaḥ saddharmanītau munayaḥ pramāṇam // 	The Abhidharma that is established through the interpretation of the Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr is, in its totality what I have explained. That some ideas, poorly grasped, are reproduced here is our fault, for only the Munis are authoritative (pramāṇa) in the interpretation of the Good Law.
nimīlite śāstari lokacakṣuṣi kṣayaṃ gate sākṣijane ca bhūyasā / adṛṣṭatattvairniravagrahaiḥ kṛtaṃ kutārkikaiḥ śāsanametadākulam // 	The Master, the eye of the world, is closed; the witnesses, for the most part, have perished; the Law is put into confusion by persons who have not seen the Truth; and by bad sophists, independent, from whom nothing is gained.
gate 'tha śāntiṃ paramāṃ svayaṃbhuvi svayaṃbhuvaḥ śāsanadhūrdhareṣu ca / jagatyanāthe gaṇaghātibhirmataiḥ niraṅkuśaiḥ svairamihādya caryate // 	For he who knows for himself has departed on the Supreme Path, as well as the supports of the Law of the one who knows for himself: the world no longer has a Protector. The defilements, which destroy spiritual qualities, now have full liberty.
iti kaṇṭhagataprāṇaṃ viditvā śāsanaṃ muneḥ / balakālaṃ malānāṃ ca na pramādyaṃ mumukṣubhiḥ // 	Seeing that the Law of the Muni is in its last breath, and that it is the hour of the forces of the defilements, those who desire liberation should be diligent. P/P: Seeing then, by a path of demonstrative arguments, that the doctrine of the teaching of the Buddhas is perfect, and rejecting the opinion of those blind through bad views and through bad steps, the non-blind see. P/P: In fact, this doctrine of the non-existence of the soul is the only road to the city of Nirvana; although illumined by the rays which are the words of this sun which is the Tathagata, although followed by thousands of saints, and although it is without obstacles, it is not seen by persons of weak insight.
