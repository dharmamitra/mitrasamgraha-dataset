Again, O kulaputra! observe the inmitable quality of our body, of our jñana, of buddhakśetra, of the accumulation of knowledge, of our aura and of the immaculate purity of speech. You too should generate similar accumulation of kuśala in various bhūmis.

” iti vistaraḥ / yacca āryavimalakīrtinirdeśe gayāśīrṣe coktaṃ tadapi pūrvoktaṃ virudhyate, evaṃ sāmānyenaiva tatrābhidhānāt /	Whatever has been propounded in Arya Vimalakirtinirdeśa and Gayāśirṣa is in contradiction of this, that is, the aforesaid postulate, because it has been dealt with these in a general sense only.

So saying at length, he again said O Maitreya! to a person who properly0 cultivates the Six Perfections for a bodhisattvas sambodhi or enlightenment, the ignorant ones will say, a bodhisattva should learn only prajñāpāramitā, what with other perfections?

No, my Lord, said Maitreya. The Lord said, O Maitreya! did those kuśalmülas or rootmerits meritorious practices pertaining to the Six Perfections, which I garnered while practising the conduct of a bodhisattva do me harm? Maitreya replied, not at all, my Lord! The Lord continued, O Ajita! you have practised the proper vows of danaparamita for sixty kalpas. If even you practise prajñapāramitā for sixty kalpas, those ignorant ones will again say, a single ‘naya or path can lead to bodhi for example, ‘śunyatā naya or the path of emptiness, this has been said in detail.

tasmādubhayaṃ sarvakālameva bodhisattvena sevanīyam / evaṃ hi bhagavatām apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇaṃ sidhyati /	Therefore, bodhisattvas should always practise both of them. This also proves that the Tathāgatas are never installed in nirvāṇa.

Again, it has been said Those who regard dharma as a mere boat should give up dharma too of course, before that adharma must also be forsaken. This has been said in order that belief in opposing or contrary dharmas is abolished and not that no support be taken for the realisation of the objective.
tathā coktam “dharmaḥ pragrahītavyo nodgrahītavyaḥ” iti / nonmārgeṇa pragrahītavya ityarthaḥ /	Hence, it has been said “dharma should be accepted but not stuck to. It means that it should not be accepted from the wrong end or contrary approach.

tatra prathamaṃ tāvat śrutamayī prajñotpādanīyā /	Now, śrutamayi prajñā should be generated first.
tayā hi tāvad āgamārtham avadhārayati / tataścintāmayyā prajñayānītaneyārthaṃ nirvedhayati /	Through it one grasps the meaning of ‘āgama. Then, through ‘chintāmayi prajñā’ one pierces or analyses the intelligible and the dubious meanings.

In that case, bhāvanā will become meaningless as in the case of tirthikas.0 As the Lord has said in Samādhiraja also If one perceives nairātmya in all dharmas and, so perceiving, one practises bhāvanā or meditation, it will become the hetu or cause of nirvāṇafruit other causes are nowise for śānti or peace. Hence, by means of contemplative wisdom and analysis through logic and scriptures, one must meditate on the true nature of bhūtas.
vastūnāṃ svarūpaṃ ca paramārthato 'nutpāda evāgamato yuktitaśca niścitam /	That all things, in the ultimate sense, are nonexistent has been concluded on the basis of logic and scriptures.
tatrāgamato yathoktam āryadharmasaṅgītau “anutpādaḥ satyamasatyam anye dharmāḥ” iti / etacca paramārthānukūlatvād anutpādaḥ satyamityuktam /	As has been stated in the scripture called, Ārya dharmasamgīti nongeneration alone is true other dharmas like generation are not true. It is stated as being in accordance with paramārtha or the ultimate meaning.
paramārthatastu notpādo nāpyanutpādaḥ, tasy sarvyavahārātītatvāt /	However, in the ultimate analysis, there is neither utpada generation or being nor ‘anutpāda nongeneration or nonbeing, because that or paramārtha is beyond all classification or label.
punaścātraiva coktam “utpādanirodhābhiniviṣṭaḥ kulaputra, lokasanniveśaḥ,	Again, it is said in the same scripture O kulputra! the attitude or position of the world is dependent on relying on utpāda generation or being and nirodha or cessation nonbeing.

It is stated in Arya Buddhasamgīti also What is the query about yoniśa, what yoni? It has been said that nongeneration is yoni and the query about it is yoniśa prichhā. And, again all dharmas are chakāra mukha because they are without beginning without cessation also, all dharmas are abhāva mukha because they are void or empty by nature..

Prajñāpāramita says “O Subhuti, form is devoid of the svabhāva selfexistence of form just as the bounds of vijñāna discriminatory cognition are devoid of the true selfexistence or svabhāva of vijñāna owing to the emptiness of all selfnature. Hastikakśya also states nothing exists whose generation or birth is possible.

ato yuktyāpi pratyavekṣanīyam /	So, examining through logic must be done.
tatra saṃkṣepato yuktirucyate /	Now about logic, briefly.
utpādo bhāvānāmahetuko vā syāt sahetuko vā / na tāvad ahetukaḥ kādācitkatvadarśanāt /	Is the generation of bhāvas things, phenomena, etc. without cause or with cause? It cannot be without cause because it is occasionally noticeable.
kāraṇānapekṣā hi viśeṣābhāvād utpādakālavat sadā sarvatraiva ca bhāvāḥ kiṃ na bhaveyuḥ / abhāvakālād aviśeṣād vā utpādakāle 'pi naiva bhaveyuḥ /	In the absence of any reliance on karaṇa or cause and because of the intervening interval, why should not things generate themselves always and everywhere as if in utpādakāla or an era of creation? If there is no interval from the time of nongeneration, there will be no generation of things even at the time of generation.
evaṃ tāvanna nirhetuko yuktaḥ /	Thus there is no generation without cause.
nāpi sahetukaḥ /	There is no generation with cause either.
tathā hi yastāvadīśvarādistīrthikairnityo hetuḥ kalpitastato bhāvā na jāyante krameṇotpādadarśanāt /	There can be no creation or being from an imaginary, permanent hetu like an iśwara0 as believed by tirthikas heretics because creation is noticeable as occurring at intervals kramaśa.
na tvavikalakāraṇasya krameṇotpādo yukto nirapekṣatvāt /	Of avikala or constant causes the result cannot be occasional owing to its nirapeksattvatā or independent constancy.
nāpīśvarādeḥ svayaṃ samarthasya parāpekṣāḥ / nityatvena parairanupakāryatvāt /	being selfcompetent need not depend on any other cause for assistance as he is permanent.
anupakāriṇi cāpekṣāyogāt /	There need be no dependence for the independent.
ata eveśvarādīnāṃ sarvasāmarthyaśūnyatvād vandhyāpūtrādivad niḥsvabhāvatvameva /	These iśwara etc. being devoid of omnipotence are nonexistent in essence like the son of a barren woman.
arthakriyāsamarthatvād vastunaḥ / teṣāṃ kvacidapi kārye na krameṇa sāmarthyaṃ yathā vicāritam /	A thing having capacity for arthakriyā’ is incapable of generating any act in an occasional sequence as has been already discussed.

ananuvṛttau vā pūrvasvabhāvaparityāgād anityatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	If there is no repetition and the previous nature is abandoned, the possibility of ‘anityatā’ or impermanence would arise.
tasmānna nityaṃ nāma kiñcid vastu vidyate /	Hence, nothing by the designation of nitya or permanent exists.
ata evoktaṃ bhagavatā “asatsamāropaḥ punarmahāmate/	The Lord has said, There is a super imposition of asata the nonexistent.

Therefore, there is none of the creation or utpäda from nitya or permanence neither is there any from anitya or impermanence, because owing to the nothingness of these during the past and the future no creation is possible from them otherwise too, it would be a creation without cause or hetu? As there is no creation in similar or dissimilar times, there can be no creation from the present time also.
nāpi bhinnakālam, kālantaravyavadhānenotpāde 'tītāderevotpattiprasaṅgāt /	There is no generation from variation in time either, because if it takes place after a difference in time, there could be generation in the past also.

Things are not selfcreated either owing to this premise being at par with the noncause postulate and the concept of the creator being self contradictory.
nāpyubhayataḥ ubhayapakṣabhāvidoṣadvaya prasaṅgāt /	There is no possibility of generating from both because of the conjunction of the drawbacks of both postulates.
tasmāt paramārthato 'nutpannā evāmī bhāvāḥ /	Hence things are without any substantial existence, i.e. unrelated in the ultimate sense.
saṃvṛtyā tūtpādasya vidyamānatvānnāgamādivirodhaḥ /	This is not contrary to the teachings of scriptures even though in an apparent or illusory sense, creation does appear to exist.

By itself, from another or from both and without cause, there can be no creation.
athavā evaṃ yuktyā vicārayet /	Now, let us examine by another argument.
dvividhā bhāvā rūpiṇo 'rūpiṇaśca /	Bhāvas are of two kinds with form and without form.
tatrāpi tāvad rūpiṇo ghatādayaste 'ṇuśo vibhinnarūpatvād naikasvabhāvāḥ /	Of these, pitcher, etc. which have form are not of one svabhāva entity, nature being composed of different atoms.

And, being in a state of conglomeration, they cannot be said to possess different selfexistence or svabhāva. There is no other existence of a thing barring single existence and multiple existence. Therefore, things with form are nissabhāva or nonexistent in the ultimate sense like a form seen in a dream.
etacca bhagavataiva coktam āryalaṅkāvatāre “goviṣāṇāṃ punarmahāmate, aṇuśo 'pi vibhidyamānaṃ nāvatiṣṭhate /	This has been stated by the Lord in Arya Lankāvatāra “O mahāmati the greatly wise even the horns of a cow, when divided into atoms, do not exist.
punarapyaṇavo 'pi bhidyamānā aṇutvalakṣaṇena nāvatiṣṭhante” iti / ye cārupiṇaste 'pi tathaiva vicāryumāṇā niḥsvabhāvā eva /	Even atoms cannot retain atomic qualities or characteristics when divided.” Things which are without form are equally nonexistent in essence, when similarly examined.
tathā hi, bāhyasya nīlāderarthasyābhāvāt sāmarthyata eva vijñānādayo 'rūpiṇaḥ skandhā nilādirūpeṇa pratibhāsanta ityabhyupeyam /	So also things outwardly appearing as blue etc. though not truly existent are only ‘vijñāna skandha or an aggregate of cognition, though without form but appearing as blue.
uktaṃ ca bhagavatā “bahirdhā nāsti vairūpaṃ svacittaṃ dṛśyate bahiḥ /” iti /	The Lord has said, there are no apparent forms only the mind sees itself i.e. its own superimposed reflection._Therefore, the blue etc.

When the nonexistence of the one is proved, the existence of the many is also impossible, because the many is only a conglomeration of the ones, If these manifestations of form etc.
athavā tatrālīkā evāmī rūpādaya ākārāḥ pratibhāsanta ityubyupagamyate, tadā vijñānam apyalīkaṃ prāpnoti /	are false or insubstantial and are accepted as such, vijñāna itself will become false because the cognition of the form will be no different from form itself.
na hi svayaṃ prakāśamānarūpatāvyatirekeṇānyad vijñānasya rūpamasti /	Vijñāna or cognition has no other form apart from its own manifest form.
svayaṃ ca na nirbhāsante rūpādayaḥ / teṣāṃ ca vijñānasvarūpāpannānām alīkatve sarvameva vijñānam alīkam abhyupetaṃ syāt /	do not shine by themselves but when they are cognised as false, cognition itself becomes false.
tasmād “māyopamaṃ ca vijñānam” ityuktaṃ bhagavatā /	That is why the Lord has said all cognition is māyā or illusory.
tasmād ekānekasvabhāvaśūnyatvena paramārthato 'līkā evāmī sarvabhāvā iti niścitametat /	So the one and the many being nonexistent are not true in the ultimate sense.
ayaṃ cārtha ukto bhagavatā laṅkāvatāre yathaiva darpaṇe rūpam ekatvānyatvavarjitam / dṛśyate na ca tatrāsti tathā bhāveṣu bhavatā // iti / ekatvānyatvavarjitam iti, ekatvānyatvarahitam ityarthaḥ / punaścoktam	The Lord has said this very thing in Lankāvatāra The nature of things is like the reflection in a mirror which is devoid of both singularity and plurality although it i.e. the reflection appears to be there but, in fact, it is not there. Devoid of ‘ekattva or singularity and anyattva or multiplicity, it is neither one nor many.

Sūtrasammuchaya also says Himself engaged in the practice of vipaśyana, if one does not help others engage themselves in vipaśyanā, it i.e. his own practice becomes an evil act. Vipaśyana is of the nature of bhuta analysis this has been stated in Arya Ratnamegha and Sandhinirmochana etc.

Well, when they do not find the sarvajñata mind while looking for it, they alone will become wise who examine abstract yoniśa, dharmas they categorise dharmas as illusion maya and mirage marichi. od It should be known that whenever the din of words like achintya unthinkable etc.
