atha śrīskānde mahāpurāṇe prathamaṃ māheśvarakhaṇḍaṃ prārabhyate | śrīgaṇeśāya namaḥ | oṃnamo bhagavate vāsudevāya | oṃnārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtya naraṃ caiva narottamam | devīṃ sarasvatī caiva tato jayamudīrayet || 1 || 	Obeisance to Śrī Gaṇeśa. Om, obeisance to Lord Vāsudeva. Om. After bowing down to Nārāyaṇa[1] as well as to (Sage) Nara,[2] the most excellent one among men, and to goddess Sarasvatī (the goddess of learning), one should narrate the Jaya.[3] 
vyāsa uvāca | yasyājñayā jagatsraṣṭāviriṃciḥ pālako hariḥ | saṃhartā kālarudrākhyo namastasmai pinākine || 1 || 	Vyāsa said: 1. Obeisance to that Lord, the wielder of Pināka bow, at whose bidding Viriñci (Brahmā) creates the universe, Hari (Viṣṇu) protects it and the god named Kālarudra annihilates it. 
tīrthānāmuttamaṃ tīrthaṃ kṣetrāṇāṃ kṣetramuttamam | tatraiva naimiṣāraṇye saunakādyāstapodhanāḥ | dīrghasatraṃ prakurvaṃtaḥ satriṇaḥ karmacetasaḥ || 2 || 	2. There, in the Naimiṣa[5] forest which is the holiest among all holy places and sacred-most among all the sacred spots (in the world), ascetics with Śaunaka[6] as their leader—ascetics who were (usual) performers of sacrifices and whose minds were (always) inclined towards holy rites, started a sacrifice of along duration. 
teṣāṃ sadarśanautsukyādāgato hi mahātapāḥ | vyāsaśiṣyo mahāprājño lomaśonāma nāmataḥ || 3 || 	3. The excessively (highly) intelligent disciple of Vyāsa, an ascetic of great austerities, named Lomaśa[7], came there with an ardent desire to see them. 
tatrāgataṃ te dadṛśurmunayo dīrghasatriṇaḥ | uttasthuryugapatsarve sārghyahastāḥ samutsukāḥ || 4 || 	4. As soon as they saw him coming, all the sages engaged in that sacrifice of long duration, stood up simultaneously with great eagerness to receive him, with materials of worship in their hands. 
dattvārghyapādyaṃ satkṛtya munayo vītakalmaṣāḥ | taṃ papracchurmahābhāgāḥ śivadharmaṃ savistaram || 5 || 	5. After offering him water for washing his feet and presenting him respectfully materials of worship the sinless sages received him with due hospitality. The sages of exalted nobility then asked him to explain in detail Śivadharma (pious activities pertaining to Śiva). 
ṛṣaya ūcuḥ | kathayasva mahāprājña devadevasya śūlinaḥ | mahimānaṃ mahābhāga dhyānārcanasamanvitam || 6 || 	The sages said: 6. Recount, O sage of extraordinary intellect, the greatness of the Trident-bearing Lord of Devas. O exalted one, describe everything along with the modes of meditation and worship. 
pradāne ca vitānasya tathā dhārāgṛhasya ca | dīpadāne kiṃ phalaṃ syātpūjāyāṃ kiṃ phalaṃ bhavet || 8 || kānikāni ca puṇyāni kathyatāṃ śivapūjane | itihāsapurāṇāni vedādhyayanameva ca || 9 || śivasyāgre prakurvaṃti kārayantyatha vā narāḥ | kiṃ phalaṃ ca nṛṇāṃ teṣāṃ kathyatāṃ vistareṇa hi || 10 || 	7-11. What is the benefit in sweeping (the temple premises)? What is the benefit in making (mystic diagrams) of various colours, in making gifts of mirror, chowries etc. (or in offering these to Śiva), in constructing canopies as well as fountains? What will be the benefit in offering lamps? What will be the fruit of the worship? What are the meritorious results in worshipping Śiva? Men read and recite the Itihāsas and Purāṇas in front of the idol of Śiva. They study (recite) the Vedas in front of him, and make others do the same. What benefit do those men derive? Let it be mentioned in detail. There is no one else in the world, O sage, more devoted to the narratives about Śiva. 
iti śrutvā vacasteṣāṃ munīnāṃ bhāvitātmanām | uvāca vyāsaśiṣyo'sau śivamāhātmyamuttamam || 12 || 	12. On hearing these words of those sages of sanctified souls, the disciple of Vyāsa recounted (to them) the excellent greatness of Śiva. Lomaśa said: 
lomaśa uvāca | aṣṭādaśapurāṇeṣu gīyate vai paraḥ śivaḥ | tasmācchivasya māhātmyaṃ vaktuṃ ko'pi na pāryate || 13 || 	13. In all the eighteen Purāṇas, Śiva is sung about as the greatest (lord). Hence no one is competent to recount the greatness of Śiva (adequately). 
śiveti dvyakṣaraṃ nāma vyāhariiṣyaṃti ye janāḥ | teṣāṃ svargaśca mokṣaśca bhaviṣyati na cānyathā || 14 || 	14. Heaven and liberation (from Saṃsāra) will be attained by those people who repeatedly utter the two-syllabled name Śi-va.[8] Not otherwise. 
udāro hi mahādevo devānāṃ patiriśvaraḥ | yena sarvaṃ pradattaṃ hi tasmātsarva iti smṛtaḥ || 15 || 	15. Munificent indeed is Mahādeva, (the great god), the lord of Devas, the Supreme Ruler. Since everything has been given by him, he is named Sarva. 
te dhanyāste mahātmāno ye bhajaṃti sadā śivam || 16 || vinā sadāśivaṃ yohi saṃsāraṃ tartumicchati | sa mūḍho hi mahāpāpaḥ śivadveṣī na saṃśayaḥ || 17 || bhakṣitaṃ hi garaṃ yena dakṣayajño vināśitaḥ | kālasya dahanaṃ yena kṛtaṃ rājñaḥ pramocanam || 18 || 	16-18. Blessed are they, noble-souled are they, who always worship Śiva (or the ever-auspicious god). A person who wishes to cross (the ocean) of worldly existence without Sadāśiva, is indeed foolish and confounded. There is no doubt that he, the hater of Śiva, is a great sinner. It was by him that (Halāhala) poison was swallowed, Dakṣa’s sacrifice was destroyed, Kāla (god of Death) was burnt down and the king was released. 
ṛṣaya ūcuḥ | yathā garaṃ bhakṣitaṃ ca yathā yajño vināśitaḥ | dakṣasya ca tathā brūhi paraṃ kautūhalaṃ hi naḥ || 19 || 	The sages requested: 19. We are very eager. Recount unto us how the poison was swallowed and how Dakṣa’s Yajña (sacrifice) was destroyed. 
sūta uvāca | dākṣāyaṇī purā dattā śaṃkarāya mahātmane | vacanādbrahmaṇo viprā dakṣeṇa parameṣṭhinaḥ || 20 || 	Sūta narrated: 20. Formerly at the instance of Brahmā Parameṣṭhin, Dākṣāyaṇī (Dakṣa’s daughter) was given (in marriage) to noble-souled Śaṅkara by Dakṣa, O brāhmaṇas. 
ekadā hi sa dakṣo vai naimiṣāraṇyamāgataḥ | yadṛcchāvaśamāpanna ṛṣibhiḥ paripūjitaḥ || 21 || stutibhiḥ praṇipātaiśca tathā sarvaiḥ surāsuraiḥ | tatra sthito mahādevo nābhyutthānābhivādane | cakārāsya tataḥ kruddho dakṣo vacanabravīt || 22 || 	21-22. Once, by chance, Dakṣa came to the Naimiṣa forest. On arrival, he was duly honoured by the sages as well as by all Suras and Asuras by means of eulogies and obeisances. Mahādeva who was present there, did not stand up nor did he offer any reverential salutation to him. Therefore, Dakṣa became furious and he spoke these words: 
sarvatra sarve hi surāsurā bhṛśaṃ namaṃti māṃ vipravarāḥ samutsukāḥ | kathaṃ hyasau durjanavanmahātmā bhūtādibhiḥ pretapiśācayuktaḥ | śmaśānavāsī nirapatrapo hyayaṃ kathaṃ praṇāmaṃ na karoti me'dhunā || 23 || 	23. “Everywhere all the Suras and Asuras as well as excellent brāhmaṇas repeatedly bow down to me with great eagerness. How is it, then, that, like a vicious fellow, this noble-souled one does not pay obeisance to me now. Accompanied by vampires, goblins and others, he is a shameless permanent resident of the cremation ground. 
pākhaṃḍino durjanāḥ pāpaśīlā vipraṃ dṛṣṭvā coddhatā unmadāśca | vadhyāstyājyāḥ sadbhirevaṃvidhā hi tasmādenaṃ śāpituṃ codyato'smi || 24 || 	24. Heretics, wicked people and habitual sinners become haughty and arrogant on seeing a brāhmaṇa. Indeed, people like these deserve killing of excommunication by good people. Hence I am intent on cursing him.” 
ityevamuktvā sa mahātapāstadā ruṣānvito rudramidaṃ babhāṣe || 25 || 	25-27. After saying thus that (Dakṣa) of great austerities, became angry and spoke to Rudra these words: 
śrṛṇvaṃtvamī vipratamā idānīṃ vaco hi me kartumihārhathaitat | rudro hyayaṃ yajñabāhyo vṛto me varṇātīto varṇaparo yataśca || 26 || 	“May these excellent brāhmaṇas listen to these words of mine. It behoves you all to carry out my words. This Rudra is considered by me as banned out of all Yajñas because he has gone beyond the Varṇas (castes) and has transgressed the discipline of the Varṇas.” 
naṃdī niśamya tadvākyaṃ śailādo hi ruṣānvitaḥ | abravīttvarito dakṣaṃ śāpadaṃ taṃ mahāprabham || 27 || 	Nandin, son of Śilāda, became furious on hearing those words. He promptly said to Dakṣa who had great refulgence but who uttered that curse: Nandin said: 
yajño dānaṃ tapaścaiva tīrthāni vividhāni ca | yasya nāmnā pavitrāṇi soyaṃ śapto'dhunā katham || 29 || vṛthā te brahmacāpalyācchapto'yaṃ dakṣa durmate | yenedaṃ pālitaṃ viśvaṃ sarveṇa ca mahātmanā | śapto'yaṃ sa kathaṃ pāpa rudro'yaṃ brāhmaṇādhama || 30 || 	28-30. Why is my lord Maheśa excluded from Yajñas? Merely by remembering him all these Yajñas become fruitful. Sacrifice, charitable gift, penance, different kinds of holy spots of pilgrimage—all these became sanctified by his name. Why has he been cursed now? He has been cursed by you foolishly and improperly due to your brāhmaṇical rashness, O evil-minded Dakṣa. It is by the noble-souled Śarva that this universe is protected. How is it that Rudra has been cursed, O sinful base brāhmaṇa? 
evaṃ nirbhārtsitastena naṃdinā hi prajāpatiḥ | naṃdinaṃ ca śaśāpātha dakṣo roṣasamanvitaḥ || 31 || 	31. On being rebuked thus by Nandin, Dakṣa, the Prajā-pati, became furious and he cursed Nandin: 
yūyaṃ sarve rudravarā vedabāhyāśca vai bhṛśam | śaptāhi vedamārgaiśca tathā tyaktā maharṣibhiḥ || 32 || pāṣaṃḍavādasaṃyuktāḥ śiṣṭa'cārabahiṣkṛtāḥ | kapālinaḥ pānaratāstathā kālamukhā hyamī || 33 || 	32-33. “All of you devoted to Rudra have been completely excluded from the Vedas. You are indeed cursed by the followers of the Vedic path and excommunicated by the great sages. You all ding to heretical doctrines. You are out of the pale of refined breeding and good conduct. All these Kapālins (followers of the skull-cult) are black-faced and addicted to drinking liquor.”[9] 
iti śaptāstadā tena dakṣeṇa śivakiṃkarāḥ | tadā prakupito naṃdī dakṣaṃ śaptuṃ pracakrame || 34 || 	34. Thus the servants of Śiva were then cursed by Dakṣa. Then the infuriated Nandin began to imprecate Dakṣa: 
śaptā vayaṃ tvayā vipra sādhavaḥ śivakiṃkarāḥ | vṛthaiva brahmacāpalyādahaṃ śāpaṃ dadāmi te || 35 || 	35. “O brāhmaṇa, although we, the servants of Śiva, are good and pious, we have been cursed by you improperly (and unnecessarily) out of your brāhmaṇical rashness. Now I shall curse you. 
vedavādaratā yūyaṃ nānyadastītivādinaḥ | kāmātmānaḥ svargaparā lobhamohasamanvitāḥ || 36 || vaidikaṃ ca puraskṛtya brāhmaṇāḥ śūdrayājakāḥ | daridriṇo bhaviṣyaṃti pratigraharatāḥ sadā || 37 || 	36-39. Arguing that there is nothing else you all adhere to Vedic doctrines. (But) you are lustful, desirous of heaven, greedy and deluded. Keeping a follower of the Vedas in front, brāhma-ṇas will perform sacrifices on behalf of Śūdras. They will always be impoverished and greedy of monetary gifts. O Dakṣa, some brāhmaṇas will become brahmarākṣasas (brahminical demons).” Lomaśa said: 
dakṣa kecidbhaviṣyanti brāhmaṇā brahmarākṣasāḥ | lomaśa uvāca | viprāste śapitāstena naṃdinā kopinā bhṛśam || 38 || 	Those brāhmaṇas were (thus) cursed by Nandin who had become excessively angry. 
athākarṇyeśvaro vākyaṃ naṃdinaḥ prahasanniva | uvāca vākyaṃ madhuraṃ bodhayayuktaṃ sadāśivaḥ || 39 || 	On hearing the words of Nandin, Sadāśiva smilingly spoke these sweet enlightening words: 
mahādeva uvāca | kopaṃ nārhasi vai kartuṃ brāhmaṇānprati vai sadā | brāhmaṇāguravo hyete vedavādaratāḥ sadā || 40 || 	Mahādeva said: 40. It does not behove you to be angry always towards brāhmaṇas. These brāhmaṇas, devoted to Vedic doctrines, are always our elders and preceptors. 
vedo maṃtramayaḥ sākṣāttathā sūktamayo bhṛśam | sūkte pratiṣṭhito hyātmā sarveṣāmapi dehinām || 41 || 	41. The Vedas are full of mantras and of sūktas (hymns). The ātman of every embodied being is established in the hymn. 
tasmānnātmavido nindyā ātmaivāhaṃ na cetaraḥ | ko'yaṃ kastvaṃ kva cāhaṃ vai kasmācchaptā hi vai dvijāḥ || 42 || prapaṃcaracanāṃ hitvā buddho bhava mahāmate | tattvajñānena nirvartya svasthaḥ krodhādivarjitaḥ || 43 || 	42-43. Hence those who have realized the ātman should not be censured. I am the ātman myself, no one else. Who is this? Who are you? Where am I? Why are the brāhmaṇas cursed? Avoid the concept of diversity, O highly intelligent one, and become enlightened. Manage (everything) through the knowledge of reality. Be established in your own self and avoid anger etc. 
evaṃ prabodhitastena śaṃbhunā parameṣṭhinā | vivekaparamo bhūtvā śailādo hi mahātapāḥ | śivena saha saṃgamya paramānaṃdasaṃplutaḥ || 44 || 	44. On being advised and instructed thus by Śaṃbḥu, the Supreme Being, Nandin (Śilāda’s son) of great austerities, became aware of true knowledge and discernment. Closely associating himself with Śiva, he became immersed in (the ocean of) great bliss. 
dakṣopi hi ruṣā'viṣṭaṛṣibhiḥ parivāritaḥ | yayau sthānaṃ svakaṃ tatra praviveśa ruṣā'nvitaḥ || 45 || 	45. Overwhelmed by anger, Dakṣa went to his abode accompanied by the sages. He entered his abode still indignant. 
śraddhāṃ vihāya paramāṃ śivapūjakānāṃ niṃdāparaḥ sa hi babhūva narādhamaśca | sarvairmaharṣibhirupetya sa tatra śarvaṃ devaṃ nininda na babhūva kadāpi śāntaḥ || 46 || 	46. Abandoning his great faith in those who worship Śiva and engaged in censuring them, he became the basest of men. Reaching that place along with all the great sages, he continued to censure lord Śiva. He never became calm. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES: Nārāyaṇa—It is significant that a Purāṇa specifically compiled for the glorification of Śi va begins with an obeisance to Nārāyaṇa. 
lomaśa uvāca | ekadā tu tadā tena yajñaḥ prāraṃbhito mahān | tatrāhūtāstadā sarve dīkṣitena tapasvinā || 1 || 	The prejudice against Kāpālikas is found even in classical Sanskrit literature.[Sanskrit text for this chapter is available] Lomaśa said: 1. Once, a great sacrifice was commenced by him (Dakṣa). All were invited to be present there by the ascetic (Dakṣa) (who was) initiated for the sacrifice. 
ṛṣayo vividhāstatra vaśiṣṭhādyāḥ samāgatāḥ | agastyaḥ kaśyapo'triśca vāmadevastathā bhṛguḥ || 2 || dadhīco bhagavānvyāso bharadvājo'tha gautamaḥ | ete cānye ca bahavaḥ samājagmurmaharṣayaḥ || 3 || 	2-3. A number of sages including Vasiṣṭha and others came there. Agastya, Kaśyapa, Atri, Vāmadeva, Bhṛgu, Dadhīca, holy lord Vyāsa, Bharadvāja and Gautama, these and many other great sages assembled there. 
tathā sarve suragaṇā lokapālastathā'pare vidyādharāśca gaṃdharvāḥ kiṃnarāpsarasāṃ gaṇāḥ || 4 || 	4. Similarly all the groups of Suras (gods), the Guardians of the Quarters and others, Vidyādharas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras and groups of celestial damsels (came there). 
saptalokātsamānīto brahmā lokapitāmahaḥ | vaikuṃṭhācca tathā viṣṇuḥ samānīto maravaṃ prati || 5 || 	5. Brahmā, the grandfather of worlds, was invited from Satyaloka. Similarly Viṣṇu was invited from Vaikuṇṭha to the place of sacrifice. 
devendro hi samānīta iṃdrāṇyā saha suprabhaḥ | tathā caṃdro hi rohiṇyā varuṇaḥ priyayayā saha || 6 || 	6. Devendra of great lustre came along with Indrāṇī. Similarly the Moon-god came along with Rohiṇī and Varuṇa came in the company of his beloved. 
kuberaḥ puṣpakārūḍho mṛgā'rūḍho'tha mārutaḥ | bastā'rūḍhaḥ pāvakaśca pretā'rūḍho'tha nirṛti || 7 || 	7. Kubera came there riding in his aerial chariot Puṣpaka, Wind-god riding on his deer, Fire-god riding on his goat and Nirṛti riding on a ghost. 
ete sarve samāyātā yajñavāṭe dvijanmanaḥ | te sarve satkṛtāstena dakṣeṇa ca durātmanā || 8 || 	8. All these came to the sacrificial enclosure of the Brāhmaṇa. All of them were received and honoured by the evil-minded Dakṣa. 
bhavanāni mahārhāṇi suprabhāṇi mahāṃti ca | tvaṣṭrā kṛtāni divyāni kauśalyena mahātmanā || 9 || 	9. Great and divine abodes of great value and good splendour were skilfully constructed by the noble-souled Tvaṣṭṛ. 
teṣu sarveṣu dhiṣṇyeṣu yathājoṣaṃ samāsthitāḥ || 10 || 	10-13. (The visitors) occupied all those abodes according to their pleasure. 
varttamāne mahāyajñe tīrthe kanakhale tathā | ṛtvijaśca kṛtāstena bhṛgvādyāśca tapodhanāḥ || 11 || dīkṣāyuktastadā dakṣaḥ kṛtakautukamaṃgalaḥ | bhāryayā sahito vipraiḥ kṛtasvatyayano bhṛśam || 12 || reje mahattvena tadā suhṛdbhiḥ paritaḥ sadā | etasminnaṃtare tatra dadhīcirvākyamabravīt || 13 || 	When the great sacrifice commenced in the holy spot Kanakhala,[1] the ascetics beginning with Bhṛgu were appointed as Ṛtviks by him. Then Dakṣa underwent due initiation. The solemn, auspicious ceremony was duly performed. Benedictory rites were completed by the Brāhmaṇas for the sake of Dakṣa accompanied by his wife. Always surrounded by his friends, he shone remarkably, thanks to his greatness. In the meantime, Dadhīci spoke these words there: 
dadhīciruvāca | ete sureśā ṛṣayo mahattarāḥ salokapālāśca samāgatāstava | tathā'pi yajñastu na śobhate bhṛśaṃpinākinā tena mahātmanā vinā || 14 || 	Dadhīci said: 14. These leading Suras (gods), the great sages and the Guardians of the Quarters have come to your (sacrifice). Still the Yajña does not shine properly without (the presence of) the noble-souled Pināka-bearing Lord. 
yenaiva sarvāṇyapi maṃgalāni jātāni śaṃsaṃti mahāvipaścitaḥ | so'sau na dṛṣṭo'tra pumānpurāṇo vṛṣadhvajo nīlakaṇṭhaḥ kapardī || 15 || 	15. Great learned men say that everything becomes auspicious and splendid through him. That primordial Puruṣa (person), the bull-bannered, blue-throated lord with matted hair, is not seen here. 
amaṃgalānyeva ca maṃgalāni bhavaṃti yenādhikṛtāni dakṣa | triyaṃbakenātha sumaṃgalāni bhavaṃti sadyohyapamaṃgalāni || 16 || 	16. Presided over and authorized by him, O Dakṣa, even inauspicious things become auspicious. (Without) the Three-eyed Lord, very auspicious things become instantly bereft of their auspiciousness. 
sarvaireva hi gaṃtavyaṃ yatra devo maheśvaraḥ || 18 || dākṣāyaṇyā sametaṃ tamānayadhvaṃ tvarānvitāḥ | tena sarvaṃ pavitraṃ syācchaṃbhunā yoginā bhṛśam || 19 || yasya smṛtyā ca nāmoktyā samagraṃ sukṛtaṃ bhavet | tasmātsarvaprayatnena samāneyo vṛṣadhvajaḥ || 20 || 	17-20. Hence he must be invited only by you immediately through Braḥmā, Viṣṇu the powerful lord and Śakra. All of them should go where lord Maheśvara is present. Bring him along with Dākṣāyaṇī. Hurry up. Everything shall become extremely sanctified through that Yogin Śaṃbhu by remembering whom and by uttering whose names, merits become well-accomplished. Hence, with all your efforts, the Bull-bannered Lord should be brought. 
tasya tadvacanaṃ śrutvā prahasannāha duṣṭadhīḥ | mūlaṃ viṣṇurhi devānāṃ yatra dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ || 21 || yasminvedāśca yajñāśca karmāṇivividhāni ca | pratiṣṭhitāni sarvāṇi so'sau viṣṇurihāgataḥ || 22 || 	21-26. On hearing these words of his, the evil-minded (Dakṣa) said laughing (derisively): “Indeed the root cause of Devas is Viṣṇu in whom the eternal virtue (Dharma) is present. In him Vedas, Yajñas and the different kinds of holy rites are established and that Viṣṇu has come here. 
satyalokātsamāyāto brahmā lokapitāmahaḥ | vedaiścopaniṣadbhiśca āgamairvividhaiḥ saha || 23 || 	Brahmā, the grandfather of the worlds, has come from Satyaloka along with the Vedas, Upaniṣads and various kinds of Āgamas (scriptural treatises). 
tathā suragaṇaiḥ sākamāgataḥ surarāṭ svayam | tathā yūyaṃ samāyātā ṛṣayo vītakalmaṣāḥ || 24 || 	Similarly the king of Suras (gods) himself has come along with the groups of Suras. So also you, the sinless sages, have come. 
yeye yajñocitāḥ śāṃtāstete sarve samāgatāḥ | vedavedārthatattvajñāḥ sarve yūyaṃ dṛḍhavratāḥ || 25 || 	All those tranquil ones who are worthy (of being present) in a Yajña have come. All of you are conversant with the Vedas, Vedic expositions and reality. All of you are steadfast in your holy rites and observances. 
atraiva ca kimasmākaṃ rudreṇāpi prayojanam | kanyā dattā mayā viprā brahmaṇā noditena hi || 26 || 	Of what avail is Rudra to us in this matter? Of course, my daughter has been given to him by me, O Brāhmaṇa, (but that was) when I had been urged by Brahmā. 
akulīno hyasau viprā naṣṭo naṣṭapriyaḥ sadā | bhūtapretapiśācānāṃ patireko duratyayaḥ || 27 || 	27. He is not of noble birth, O Brāhmaṇa. He is doomed and he is always a favourite of the doomed. He is the sole lord of goblins, ghosts and vampires. He is unfathomable. 
ātmasaṃbhāvito mūḍhaḥstabdho maunī samatsaraḥ | karmaṇyasminnayogyo'sau nānīto hi mayā'dhunā || 28 || 	28. He esteems himself very much. He is deluded and stubborn. He is tacitern, jealous and malicious. In this holy rite he is utterly unworthy. Hence indeed he was not invited by me now. 
tasmāttvayā na vaktavyaṃ punarevaṃ vacodvija | sarvairbhavadbhiḥ kartavyo yajño me saphalo mahān || 29 || 	29. Hence, words like these should not be uttered by you again, O Brāhmaṇa. My great Yajña should be made successful by all of you collectively.” 
etacchrutvā vacastasya dadhīcirvākyamabravīt || 30 || 	30. On hearing these words of his, Dadhīci made the following statement: 
dadhīciruvāca | sarveṣāmṛṣivaryāṇāṃ surāṇāṃ bhāvitātmanām | anayo'yaṃ mahāñjāto vinā tena mahātmanā || 31 || 	Dadhīci said: 31. Great injustice has been done to all these excellent sages and Devas of sanctified soul by not having the noble soul with them. 
vināśo'pi mahānsadyohyatratyānāṃ bhaviṣyati | evamuktvā dadhīco'sāveka eva vinirgataḥ || 32 || 	32-33. A great ruin will soon befall all those who are present here. 
yajñavāṭācca dakṣasya tvaritaḥ svāśramaṃ yayau | munau vinirgate dakṣaḥ prahasannidamabravīt || 33 || 	After saying thus, Dadhīci alone walked out in protest from the sacrificial enclosure of Dakṣa and hurriedly went to his hermitage. When the sage went out, Dakṣa said this laughingly: 
gataḥ śivapriyo vīro dadhīcirnāma nāmataḥ | āviṣṭacittā maṃdāśca mithyāvādaratāḥ khalāḥ || 34 || 	34-36. “There, a heroic supporter and friend of Śiva named Dadhīci, has gone out. All those slow-witted rogues whose minds are possessed by evil spirits, who are enamoured of heretic doctrines, who are excluded from the Vedas and whose behaviour and acts are vicious, should leave this holy rite. 
vedabāhya durācārāstyājyāste hyatra karmaṇi | vedavādaratā yūyaṃ sarve viṣṇupurogamāḥ || 35 || 	You are all devoted to Vedic doctrines having Viṣṇu as your leader. O Brāhmaṇas, make my Yajña fruitful ere long.” 
yajñaṃ me saphalaṃ viprāḥ kurvaṃtu hyacirādiva | tadā te devayajanaṃ cakruḥ sarve saharṣayaḥ || 36 || 	Then all of them along with the sages performed the worship of the lord. 
etasminnaṃtare tatra parvate gaṃdhamādane | dhārāgṛhe vimānena sakhībhiḥ parivāritā || 37 || dākṣāyaṇī mahādevī cakāra vividhāstadā | krīḍā vimānamadhyastā kandukādyāḥ sahasraśaḥ || 38 || 	37-40. In the meantime there on the mountain Gandhamādana[3] the great goddess Dākṣāyaṇī was engaged in various kinds of sports. She was surrounded by her female friends. Sometimes she played beneath in the Dhārāgṛha (chamber fitted with fountains and water-jets). Sometimes she moved about in an aerial chariot- Sometimes she stood in the middle of the aerial chariot and indulged in thousands of sports with balls etc. 
krīḍāsaktā tadā devī dadarśātha mahāsatī | yajñaṃ prayāṃtaṃ somaṃ ca rohiṇyā sahitaṃ prabhum || 39 || 	While engaged in playing the games, the great goddess Satī saw the Moon-god going to the place of sacrifice along with Rohiṇī. 
kva gamiṣyati caṃdro'yaṃ vijaye pṛccha satvaram | tayoktā vijayā devī taṃ papraccha yathocitam || 40 || 	She said to her maid Vijayā, “Where is Candra going now? O Vijayā, go and enquire immediately.” On being thus instructed by her, the gentle lady Vijayā asked him suitably. 
kathitaṃ tena tatsarvaṃ dakṣasyaiva makhādikam | tacchrutvā tvaritā devī vijayā jātasaṃbhramā | kathayāmāsa tatsarvaṃ yaduktaṃ śaśinā bhṛśam || 41 || 	41. Everything about Dakṣa’s sacrifice and other things were told by him. On hearing it the gentle lady Vijayā became agitated. Hurriedly (she went to Satī) and told her everything exactly as it was said by the Moon-god. 
vimṛśya kāraṇaṃ devī kimāhvānaṃ karoti na | dakṣaḥ pitā me mātā ca vismṛtā māṃ kuto'dhunā || 42 || pṛcchāmi śaṃkaraṃ cādya kāraṇaṃ kṛtaniścayā | sthāpayitvā sakhīstatra āgatā śaṃkaraṃ prati || 43 || 	42-43. The goddess began to ponder over the reason thus: ‘Why does he not invite (us)? Dakṣa is my father. Why has my mother forgotten me now? I shall ask Śaṅkara now about the reason (thereof).’ After deciding thus, she asked the friends to stay there and approached Śaṅkara. 
dadarśataṃ sabhāmadhye trilocanamavasthitam | gaṇaiḥ parivṛtaṃ sarvaiścaṃḍamuṃḍādibhistadā || 44 || bāṇo bhṛṃgistathā naṃdī śailādo hi mahātapāḥ | mahākālo mahācaṃḍo mahāmuṃḍo mahāśirāḥ || 45 || dhūmrākṣo dhūmraketuśca dhūmrapādastathaiva ca | ete cānye ca bahavo gaṇā rudrānuvartinaḥ || 46 || 	44-49. She saw the Three-eyed Lord in the centre of the assembly stationed there, in an extremely wonderful seat, and surrounded by all his Gaṇas (attendants) beginning with Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, Bāṇa, Bhṛṅgin, Nandin of great power of penance, the son of Śilāda, Mahākāla, Mahācaṇḍa. Mahāmuṇḍa, Mahāśiras, Dhūmrākṣa, Dhūmraketu and Dhūmrapāda—these and many other Gaṇas, the followers of Rudra, (were present there). Some were hideous and terrifying. Others were mere headless trunks. Some had no eyes. Others were devoid of chests. There were hundreds like these. All of them had elephant-hides for their clothes. Clusters of matted hair were their ornaments. All were adorned with Rudrākṣa beads. They were devoid of attachment, They had conquered their sense-organs. They, were antagonistic to objects of sensual pleasure. Śaṅkara, the benefactor of the worlds, was seen by her surrounded by all these. 
ākṣiptacittā sahasā jagāma śivasaṃnidhim | śivena sthāpitā svāṃke prītiyuktena vallabhā || 50 || premṇoditā vacobhiḥ sā bahumānapuraḥsaram | kimāgamanakāryaṃme vada śīghraṃ sumadhyame || 51 || 	50-52. Bewildered in her mind, she suddenly went to Śiva’s presence. The beloved wife was placed in his lap by Śiva who was pleased. She was addressed with loving words with due respect: “O lady of excellent waistline, what is the purpose of your arrival? Tell me quickly.” 
evamuktā tadā tena uvācāsitalocanā || 52 || 	On being spoken thus by him, the dark-eyed lady said: 
satyuvāca | piturmama mahāyajñe kasmāttava na rocate | gamanaṃ devadevaśa tatsarvaṃ kathaya prabho || 53 || 	Satī said: 53. O lord, O lord of the chiefs of Devas, how is it that going to the great sacrifice of my father is not approved of by you? Tell (me) everything. 
suhṛdāmeṣa vai dharmaḥ suhṛdbhiḥ saha saṃgatim | kurvaṃti yanmahādeva suhṛdāṃ prītivardhinīm || 54 || tasamātsarvaprayatnena anāhūto'pi gaccha bhoḥ | yajñavāṭaṃ piturme'dya vacanānme sadāśiva || 55 || 	54-55. This is the duty of friends, O Mahādeva, that they (regularly) associate with their friends, thereby increasing the pleasure and love of their friends. Hence make all efforts (to be present there). Oh, go there even if you have not been invited. Go to the sacrificial enclosure of my father today at my request, O Sadāśiva. 
tasyāstadvacanaṃ śrutvā ba bhāṣe sūnṛtaṃ vacaḥ | tvayā bhadre na gaṃtavyaṃ dakṣasya yajanaṃ prati || 56 || 	56-57. On hearing her words (Śiva) spoke these kind and sincere words: 
tasya ye māninaḥ sarve sasurāsukiṃnarāḥ | te sreva yajanaṃ prāptāḥ pitustava na saṃśayaḥ || 57 || 	“O gentle lady, you must not go to the sacrifice of Dakṣa. All those persons who honour Dakṣa, including Suras, Asuras and Kinnaras, have undoubtedly gone to the sacrifice of your father. 
anāhūtāśca ye subhru gacchaṃti paramandiram | apamānaṃ prāpnuvanti maraṇādadhikaṃ tataḥ || 58 || pareṣāṃ maṃdiraṃ prāpta iṃdropi laghutāṃ vrajet | tasmāttvāyā na gaṃtavyaṃ dakṣasya yajanaṃ śubhe || 59 || 	58-59. O lady of fine eyebrows, those who go to others’ mansions without being invited, meet with insult which is more (painful) than death. Even Indra who goes to the abode of others meets with contempt and disrespect. Hence, O splendid lady, you must not go to Dakṣa’s sacrifice.” 
evamuktā satī tena maheśena mahātmanā | uvāca roṣasaṃyuktaṃ vākyaṃ vākyavidāṃ varā || 60 || 	60. On being told thus by the noble-souled Śiva, Satī, the most excellent one among those who are conversant with modes of expression, spoke these words full of anger: 
yajño hi satyaṃ loke tvaṃ sa tvaṃ devavareśvara | anāhūto'si tenādya pitrā me dṛṣṭacāriṇā | tatsarvaṃ jñātumicchāmi tasya bhāvaṃ durātmanaḥ || 61 || 	61. “It is true that you are (the real) Yajña in this world, O most excellent lord of Devas. (How is it) that you have not been invited by my father of evil conduct today? Hence I wish to know thoroughly the attitude of that evil-minded one. 
tasmāccādyaiva gacchāmi yajñavāḍaṃ piturmmama | anujñāṃ dehi me nātha devadeva jagatpate || 62 || 	62. Hence I shall go to the sacrificial enclosure of my father today itself. Grant me permission, O my lord, lord of the universe, lord of Devas.” 
ityukto bhagavānrudrastayā devyā śivaḥ svayam | vijñātākhiladṛgdraṣṭā bhagavānbhūtabhāvanaḥ || 63 || 	63-65a. On being told thus by that goddess, Lord Śiva himself, who has knowledge and vision of everything, the lord who is the sanctifier of all living beings, the lord of Devas, Maheśa, the bestower of all Siddhis said to her: 
sa tāmuvāca deveśo maheśaḥ sarvasiddhidaḥ | gaccha devi tvarāyuktā vacanānmama suvrate || 64 || 	“Go quickly, O gentle lady of holy rites, at my instance, riding on this Nandin and accompanied by various kinds of Gaṇas.” 
etaṃ naṃdinamāruhya nānāvidhagaṇānvitā | gaṇāḥ ṣaṣṭisahasrāṇi jagmūraudrāḥ śivajñayā || 65 || tairgaṇaiḥ saṃvṛtā devī jagāma pitṛmaṃdiram | nirīkṣya tadbalaṃ sarvaṃ mahādevotivismitaḥ || 66 || bhūṣaṇāni mahārhāṇi tebhyo devyai paraṃtapaḥ | preṣayāmāsa cāvyagro mahādevo'nu pṛṣṭhataḥ || 67 || 	65b-68. At the bidding of Śiva, sixty thousand of the terrifying Gaṇas went (along with her). Surrounded by those Gaṇas, the goddess went to the abode of her father. Observing the entire army, Mahādeva became excessively surprised. Mahādeva, the unperturbed scorcher of enemies, sent very valuable ornaments to her through his attendants. He sent them immediately after her. 
devyā gataṃ vai svapiturgṛhaṃ tadā vimṛśya sarvaṃ bhagavānmaheśaḥ | dākṣāyaṇī pitravamānitā satī na yāsyatīti svapuraṃ punarjagau || 68 || 	Pondering over the departure of the goddess to her father’s abode, Lord Maheśa exclaimed: “On being insulted by her father, Satī, the daughter of Dakṣa, will never come back to her city again.” 
iti śrīskāṃde mahāpurāṇa ekāśītisāhasryāṃ saṃhitāyāṃ prathame māheśvarakhaṇḍe kedārakhaṃḍe dakṣayajñaṃ prati satīdevyāgamanavarṇanaṃnāma dvitīyo'dhyāyaḥ || 2 || 	Kanakhala—A village two miles to the east of Haridwar (U.P.), at the junction of Gaṅgā and Nīladhārā. 
lomaśa uvāca | dākṣāyaṇī gatā tatra yatra yajño mahānabhūt | tatpituḥ sadanaṃ gatvā nā nāścaryasamanvitam || 1 || dvāri sthitā tadā devā avatīrya nijāsanāt | naṃdino hi mahābhāgā devalokaṃ nirīkṣya ca || 2 || mātaraṃ pitaraṃ dṛṣṭvā suhṛtsaṃbaṃdhi vāṃdhavān | abhivādyaiva pirataṃ mātaraṃ ca mudānvitā || 3 || 	1-4a. Dākṣāyaṇī went to the place where the great sacrifice was being performed. After going to the abode of her father, the abode which was full of various wonderful things, she stood at the entrance. The Devas of exalted fortune became delighted. They got down from their seats. After seeing the congregation of the Devas, her parents, friends, relatives and kinsmen, she made obeisance to her father and mother with delight. Then the goddess spoke these words in a manner suitable to the occasion: 
śaṃbhunā hi vinā tāta kathaṃ yajñaḥ pravartate | ete kathaṃ samāyātā brahmaṇā sahitāḥ pitaḥ || 7 || he bhṛgo tvaṃ na jānāsi he kaśyapa mahāmate | atre viśiṣṭha ekastvaṃ śakra kiṃ kṛtamadyate || 8 || he viṣṇo tvaṃ mahādevaṃ jānāsi parameśvaram | brahmankiṃ tvaṃ na jānāsi mahādevasya vikramam || 9 || 	4b-9. “Why was Śaṃbḥu, the extremely splendid (lord), not invited by you? (He is the lord) by whom this entire universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings has been sanctified. He is Yajña (incarnate), an (important) part of Yajña, the sacrificial gift offered therein, the material offered therein, the Mantras etc., the Havya and Kavya—he is identical with all these things. He is the most excellent one among those who are expert in performing Yajñas. Everything performed without him will become impure. How can a sacrifice function (at all), O dear father, without Śaṃbhu? How did these come here, O father, along with Brahmā? Don’t you know? O Bhṛgu, O Kaśyapa of great intellect, O Atri, O Vasiṣṭha? You are alone, O Śakra, what has been done by you today? O Viṣṇu, you do know the supreme lord Mahādeva. O Brahmā, don’t you know the valour of Mahādeva? 
purā paṃcamukho bhūtvā garvitosi sadāśivam | kṛtaścaturmukhastena vismṛto'si tadadbhutam || 10 || 	10. Formerly you happened to be five-faced. You (spoke) arrogantly to Sadāśiva and you were made four-faced. It is surprising that you have forgotten that miracle. 
bhikṣāṭanaṃ kṛtaṃ yena purā dāruvane vibhuḥ | śaptoyaṃ bhikṣuko rudro bhavadbhiḥ sakhibhistadā || 11 || 	11. He is the lord Rudra who formerly begged for alms in the forest of Dāruvana,[1] when this mendicant was cursed by you (and) your friends. 
śaptenāpi ca rudreṇa bhavadbhirvismṛtaṃ katham | yasyāvayavamātreṇa pūritaṃ sacarācaram || 12 || liṃgabhūtaṃ jagatsarvaṃ jātaṃ tatkṣaṇameva hi | layānālliṃgamityāhuḥ sarve devāḥ savāsavāḥ || 13 || sarve devāśca saṃbhūtā yato devasya śūlinaḥ | so'sau vedāṃtago devastvayā jñātuṃ na pāryate || 14 || 	12-14. Even after cursing Rudra, how was (this incident) forgotten by you? He is the lord by whose limb alone the universe including the mobile and immobile beings, has been filled up. The entire universe became the Liṅga at that very instant. They call it Liṅga because of the dissolution (of the universe in it).[2] All the Devas along with Vāsava (Indra) are born of the Trident-bearing Lord. Such a lord who is to be realized through the Vedāntas, cannot be comprehended by you.” 
tasyā vacanamākarṇya dakṣaḥ kruddho'bravīdvacaḥ | kiṃ tvayā bahunoktena kāryaṃ nāstīha sāṃpratam || 15 || 	15-19a. On hearing her words, Dakṣa became angry and spoke these words: 
gaccha vā tiṣṭhavā bhadre kasmāttvaṃ hi samāgatā | amaṃgalo hi bhartā te aśivosau sumadhyame || 16 || 	“Of what avail is your verbal prolixity. It has no relevance to the present occasion. O gentle lady, (you may) go or stay. Why did you come at all? Your husband is an inauspicious fellow, not conducive to propitiousness, O lady of good waistline. 
akulīno vedabāhyo bhūtapretapiśācarāṭ | tasmānnākārito bhadre yajñārthaṃ cārubhāṣiṇi || 17 || 	He is ignoble, excluded from the Vedas. He is the king of goblins, ghosts and vampires. Hence he was not invited to the sacrifice, O gentle lady of sweet speech. 
mayā dattāsi suśroṇi pāpinā maṃdabuddhinā | rudrāyāviditārthāya uddhatāya durātmane || 18 || tasmātkāyaṃ parityajya svasthā bhava śucismite | dakṣeṇoktā tadā putrī sā satī lokapūjitā || 19 || 	O lady of excellent loins, it is to Rudra who is haughty and evil-minded and of unknown antecedents that you had been given in marriage by me, a dull-witted sinner. Hence, abandon this body (of yours), O lady of pure smiles, and be happy.” 19b-23. It was thus that his own daughter Satī who was worshipped by all the worlds, was addressed by Dakṣa then. 
niṃdāyuktaṃ svapitaraṃ vilokya ruṣitā bhṛśam | ciṃtayaṃtī tadā devī kathaṃ yāsyāmi maṃdire || 20 || śaṃkaraṃ draṣṭukāmāṃha kiṃ vakṣye tena pṛcchitā | yo niṃdati mahādevaṃ niṃdyamānaṃ śrṛṇoti yaḥ | tāvubhau narake yāto yāvaccandradivākarau || 21 || tasmāttayakṣyāmyahaṃ dehaṃ pravekṣyāmi hutāśanam || 22 || 	On seeing her own father full of contempt (for Śiva), Satī became excessively furious. Then the goddess thought thus: ‘Though I am desirous of seeing Śaṅkara, how can I go back to our mansion? What will I say if I am asked (about this incident) by him? He who censures Mahādeva and he who listens when Mahādeva is being censured—both of them go to hell and remain there as long as the moon and the sun (shine). Hence I will abandon this body and enter fire.’ Pondering thus and being overwhelmed by insult, she entered fire[3] uttering the words “O Rudra, O Śiva”. 
hāhākāreṇa mahatā vyāptamāsīddigaṃtaram | sarve te maṃcamārūḍhāḥ śastrairvyāptā niraṃtarāḥ || 24 || śastraiḥ svairjadhnurātmānaṃ svāni dehāni cicchiduḥ | kecitkaratale gṛhya śirāṃsi svāni cotsukāḥ || 25 || 	24-30. The entire quarters became pervaded with the great uproar of “Alas! Alas!”. All those (who had come with Satī) climbed on to the platform. Laden with weapons they crowded the place without any gap. They hit and struck themselves with their weapons. They cut off their own bodies. Some of them cut off their heads and eagerly performed the Nīrājana (waving of the lights in circles) rites with them. Immediately they were reduced to ash. Then everyone said thus: “Twenty thousand of the Gaṇas roared terrifically. Those dreadful ones cut off their limbs by means of weapons. Thus they all perished there along with Dākṣāyaṇī.”[4] 
gaṇāstatrāyūte dve ca tadadbhutamivābhavat | te sarva ṛṣayo devā iṃdrādyāḥ samarudgaṇāḥ || 28 || viśve'śvanau lokapālāstūṣṇīṃbūtāstadābhavan | viṣṇuṃ vareṇyaṃ kecicca prārthayaṃtaḥ samaṃtataḥ || 29 || evaṃ bhūtastadā yajño jātastasya durātmanaḥ | dakṣasya brahmabaṃdhośca ṛṣayo bhayamāgatāḥ || 30 || 	That was a great miracle. All sages, the Devas beginning with Indra, along with the groups of Maruts, Viśvedevas, Aśvins and the Guardians of the Quarters—all these became silent then. Some of them (walked) round requesting Viṣṇu, the most excellent one. This was the end of the Yajña of that evil-minded one. The Yajña of the unworthy Brāhmaṇa Dakṣa (was ruined) and the sages became afraid. 
etasminnaṃtare viprā nāradena mahātmanā | kathitaṃ sarvamevaitaddakṣasya ca viceṣṭitam || 31 || 	31. In the meantime, O Brāhmaṇas, all these activities and behaviour of Dakṣa were communicated to Rudra by the noble-minded Nārada. 
tadākarṇyeśvaro vākyaṃ nāradasya mukhodgatam | cukopa paramaṃ kruddha āsanādutpatanniva || 32 || 	32. On hearing Nārada’s report the supreme Lord Śiva became extremely infuriated. In his anger he as if jumped up from his seat. 
uddhṛtya ca jaṭāṃ rudro lokasaṃhārakārakaḥ | āsphoṭayāmāsa ruṣā parvatasya śiropari || 33 || 	33. Uprooting a plait of hair from his (matted hair), Rudra, the cause of the annihilation of all the worlds, angrily dashed it on the top of the mountain. 
tāḍanācca samudbhūto vīrabhadro mahāyaśāḥ | tathā kālī samutpannā bhūtakoṭibhirāvṛtā || 34 || 	34. As a result of this dashing, Vīrabhadra of great fame rose up. So also did Kālī surrounded by crores of spirits and goblins. 
kopānniḥśvasitenaiva rudrasya ca mahātmanaḥ | jātaṃ jvarāṇāṃ ca śataṃ sannipātāstrayodaśa || 35 || 	35. Through the wrathful breath of the noble-minded Rudra a hundred (types of) Fevers and thirteen Sannipātas (combined derangement of all the three humours causing deadly varieties of fevers) rose up. 
vijñapto vīrabhadreṇa rudro raudraparākramaḥ | kiṃ kāryaṃ bhavataḥ kāryaṃ śīghrameva vada prabho || 36 || 	36. Rudra of fierce and dreadful exploits was entreated by Vīrabhadra “O Lord! what task of Your Lordship is to be carried out? Tell me quickly.” 
ityukto bhagavānrudraḥ preṣayāmāsa satvaram | gaccha vīra mahā bāho dakṣayajñaṃ vināśaya || 37 || 	37. On being requested thus, lord Rudra hurriedly commissioned him, “Destroy Dakṣa’s Yajña.” 
śāsanaṃ śirasā dhṛtvā devadevasya śūlinaḥ | kālikā'lihito vīraḥ sarvabhūtaiḥ samāvṛtaḥ | vīrabhadro mahātejā yayau dakṣamakhaṃ prati || 38 || 	38. Receiving the behest of the Trident-bearing Lord of Devas with his head (i.e. humbly accepting the order), the heroic Vīrabhadra of excessive refulgence, who was kissed (ā-līḍhā) by Kālikā and was surrounded by all goblins rushed to Dakṣa’s sacrifice. 
tadānīmeva sahasā durnimittāni cābhavan | rūkṣo vavau tadā vāyuḥ śarkarābhiḥ samāvṛtaḥ || 39 || asṛgvarṣati devaśca timireṇā'vṛtā divaśaḥ | ulkāpātāśca bahavaḥ petururvyāṃ sahasraśaḥ || 40 || 	39-40. At that very time, ill-omens occurred suddenly. A rough wind blew carrying with it gravels and sand. The Rain-god showered blood. The quarters were enveloped in darkness. Thousands of meteors fell on the earth. 
evaṃvidhānyariṣṭāni dadṛśurvibudhādayaḥ | dakṣo'pi bhayamāpanno viṣṇuṃ śaraṇamāyayau || 41 || 	41. The Devas and others saw such phenomena foreboding evil. Becoming frightened, Dakṣa sought refuge in Viṣṇu. 
rakṣarakṣa mahāviṣṇo tvaṃ hi naḥ paramo guruḥ | yajño'si tvaṃ suraśreṣṭha bhayānmāṃ parimocaya || 42 || 	42. “Save me, save me, O great Viṣṇu. Indeed you are our greatest preceptor and elderly one. You are (identical with) Yajña, O most excellent one among Suras. Save me from this fearful danger,” 
dakṣeṇa prārthya māno hi jagāda madhusūdanaḥ | mayā rakṣā vidātavyā bhavato nātra saṃśayaḥ || 43 || 	43. On being requested and prayed to by Dakṣa, the slayer of Madhu (Viṣṇu) said: “Protection should be accorded to you by me. There is no doubt about it. 
apūjyā yatra pūjyaṃte pūjanīyo na pūjyate | trīṇī tatra pravartaṃte durbhikṣaṃ tvayā dharmamajānatāḥ | īśvarāvajñayā sarvaṃ viphalaṃ ca bhaviṣyati || 44 || 	44. Disrespect has been shown by you, O Dakṣa, without understanding genuine Dharma (Virtue). Due to the contemptuous disregard of Lord Śiva, everything will become fruitless. 
apūjyā yatra pūjyaṃ te pūjanīyo na pūjyate | trīṇī tatra pravartaṃte durbhikṣaṃ maraṇaṃ bhayam || 45 || 	45. Where those who are not worthy of respect are worshipped, where he who is worthy of being worshipped is not worshipped, three consequences, viz. famine, death and fear, prevail there. 
tasmātsarvaprayatnena mānanīyo vṛṣadhvajaḥ | amānitānmaheśāttvāṃ mahadbhayamupasthitam || 46 || 	46. Hence, the Bull-bannered Lord (Śiva) should be honoured with all efforts. Great fear and danger beset you because the great lord was not honoured. 
adhunaiva vayaṃ sarve prabhavo na bhavāmahe | bhavato durnnayeneva nātra kāryā vicāraṇā || 47 || 	47. All of us are not powerful enough now, because of your evil behaviour. There is no need to discuss this matter further.” 
viṣṇostadvacanaṃ śrutvā dakṣaściṃtāparo'bhavat | vivirṇavadano bhūtvā tūṣṇīmāsīdbhuvi sthitaḥ || 48 || 	48. On hearing those words of Viṣṇu, Dakṣa became lost in (anxious) thoughts. Turning pale in the face, he remained silent and sat on the ground. 
vīrabhadro mahābāhū rudreṇaiva pracoditaḥ | kālī kātyāyanīśānā cāmuṃḍā muṃḍamarddinī || 49 || bhadrakālī tathā bhadrā tvaritā vaiṣṇavī tathā | navadurgādisahito bhūtānāṃ ca gaṇo mahān || 50 || śākinī ḍākinī caiva bhūtapramathaguhyakāḥ | tathaiva yoginīcakraṃ catuḥ ṣaṣṭyā samanvitam || 51 || 	49-51. Expressly commanded by Rudra himself the extremely powerful Vīrabhadra came to the sacrificial enclosure accompanied by the nine Durgās and others.[5] The nine Durgās were Kālī, Kātyāyanī, Īśānā, Cāmuṇḍā, Muṇḍamardinī, Bhadrakālī, Bhadrā, Tvaritā and Vaiṣṇavī. A big multitude of Bhūtas also entered the sacrificial enclosure of great refulgence. Śākinīs, Ḍākinīs, Bhūtas, Pramathas, Guhyakas, a host of Yoginīs (in circular formation) along with the sixty-four (Tantras)[6]—all these entered the sacrificial enclosure suddenly. 
pārṣadāḥ śaṃkarasyaite sarve rudrasvarūpiṇaḥ | paṃcavaktrā nīlakaṃṭhāḥ sarve te śastrapāṇayaḥ || 53 || chatracāmarasaṃvītāḥ sarve haraparākramāḥ | daśabāhavastrinetrā jaṭilā rudrabhūṣaṇāḥ || 54 || ardhacaṃdradharāḥ sarve sarve caiva mahaujasaḥ | sarve te vṛṣabhārūḍhāḥ sarve te veṣabhūṣaṇāḥ || 55 || 	52-55. Hundreds and thousands of Gaṇas who accompanied Vīrabhadra were all the Pārṣadas (attendants) of Śaṅkara. All of them had the form of Rudra. They had five faces and blue throats. All had weapons in their hands. They were duly served with umbrellas and chowries. All were as valorous as Śiva. They had ten arms and three eyes. Their hair was matted. They wore the ornaments of Rudra. Bearing crescent moon (on their heads), all of them had (different kinds of) robes and ornaments. 
sahasrabāhurbhujagādhipairvṛtastrilocano bhīmabalo bhayāvahaḥ | ebhiḥ sametaśca tadā mahātmā sa vīrabhadro'bhijagāma yajñam || 56 || 	56. Accompanied by these, the noble-souled, three-eyed, dreadful Vīrabhadra of terrible might, who had a thousand arms and was entwined by great serpents, marched towards the sacrifice. 
yugyānāṃ ca sahasreṇa dvipramāṇena syaṃdanam | siṃhānāṃ prayutenaiva vāhyamānaṃ ca tasya tat || 57 || 	57. His chariot was drawn by two thousand horses and a million lions. 
tathaiva daṃśitāḥ siṃhā bahavaḥ pārśvarakṣakāḥ | śārdūlā makarā matsyā gajāścaiva sahasraśaḥ | chatrāṇi vividhānyeva cāmarāṇi tathaiva ca || 58 || 	58-59a. The armoured defenders of his sides were many lions, tigers, sharks, fishes and thousands of elephants. He had different kinds of umbrellas and chowries held over the head of everyone everywhere. 
mūrddhanidhriyamāṇāni sarvatogrāṇi sarvaśaḥ | tato bherīmahānādāḥ śaṃkhāśca vividhasvanāḥ | paṭahā gomukhāścaiva śrṛṃgāṇi vividhāni ca || 59 || 	59bc. Then high sounding Bherīs (war-drums), conchs of various (degrees of) sounds, Paṭahas (kettle-drums), musical instruments like Gomukka, different kinds of horns were sounded. 
tato'vādyaṃta tānyeva ghanāni suṣirāṇi ca | kalagānaparāḥ sarve sarve mṛdaṃgavādinaḥ || 60 || 	60. Cymbals, gongs and wind instruments were played. All of them were engaged in singing pleasantly. All of them played on Mṛdaṅgas (special drums). 
anekalāsyasaṃyuktā vīrabhadrāgratobhavan | raṇavāditranirghoṣairjagarjuramitaujasaḥ || 61 || 	61. The Gaṇas proceeded ahead in front of Vīrabhadra indulging in different kinds of dances. Those Gaṇas of unmeasured power and potency roared along with the martial sounds of the musical instruments. 
tena nādena mahatā nāditaṃ bhuvanatrayam | evaṃ sarve samāyātā gaṇā rudrapraṇoditāḥ || 62 || yajñavāṭaṃ ca dakṣasya vināśārthaṃ prahāriṇaḥ | rajasā cā'vṛtaṃ vyoma tamasā ca vṛtā diśaḥ || 63 || 	62-63a. By that great sound the three worlds echoed and reverberated. Thus all those Gaṇas ordered (urged) by Rudra came there to the sacrificial enclosure of Dakṣa and began to smash for the sake of destroying it. 
saptadvīpavatī pṛthvī cacāla sādrikānanā | te dṛṣṭvā mahadāścaryyaṃ lokakṣayakaraṃ tadā || 64 || 	63b-64a. The sky was covered with dust and all the quarters were enveloped in darkness. The earth consisting of the seven islands (continents)[7] shook along with the mountains and forests. 
uttasthuryugapatsarve devadaityaniśācarāḥ | te vai dadṛśurāyāṃtīṃ rudrasenā bhayāvahām || 65 || 	64b-65. Those Devas, Daityas and night-wanderers observed this wonderful spectacle foreboding the ruin of all the worlds. Ail of them stood up simultaneously. They saw the dreadful army of Rudra advancing. 
pṛthvīṃ kecitsamāyātā gagane kecidāgatāḥ | diśaśca pradiśaścaiva samāvṛtya tathāpare || 66 || anaṃtā hyakṣayāḥ sarve śūrā rudrasamā yudhi | evaṃbhūtaṃ ca tatsainyaṃ rudraiśca parivāritam | dṛṣṭvo curvismitāḥ sarve yāmo'dya śastrapāṇayaḥ || 67 || 	66-67. Some of them were coming over the earth. Some were coming through the sky. Others covered the quarters and the intervening spaces and rushed on. All of them were of inexhaustible strength; infinite (in number), they were heroic on a par with Rudra in battle. On seeing such an army surrounded by (the followers of) Rudra, alī of them said in great surprise and dismay: “Let us advance (against them) with weapons in the hands.” 
iṃdro hi gajamārūḍho mṛgārūḍhaḥ sadāgatiḥ | yamo mahiṣamārūḍho yamadaṃḍasamanvitaḥ || 68 || kuberaḥ puṣpakārūḍhaḥ pāśī makarameva ca | agnirbastamārūḍho nirṛtiḥ pretameva ca || 69 || tathānye surasaṃghāśca yakṣacāraṇaguhyakāḥ | āruhya vāhanānyeva svānisvāni pratipinaḥ || 70 || 	68-70. Indra rode on his elephant. The Wind-god rode on a deer. Yama equipped with the rod of death rode on a buffalo. Kubera drove in the aerial chariot Puṣpaka. Varuṇa rode on a shark. The Fire-god rode on a goat. Nirṛti rode on a ghost. Similarly other groups of Suras, Yakṣas, Cāraṇas and Guhyakas, valorously rode on their respective vehicles. 
sveṣāmudyogamālokya dakṣaścāśrumukhastataḥ | daṃḍavatpatito bhūmau sarvānevābhyabhāṣata || 71 || 	71. On seeing the preparations of his own people, Dakṣa’s face was covered with tears. He prostrated himself on the ground and spoke to all of them: 
yuṣmadbalenaiva mayā yajñaḥ prāraṃbhito mahān | satkarmasiddhaye yūyaṃ pramāṇaṃ sumahāprabhāḥ || 72 || 	72. “O (friends) of great lustre, it was on the strength of your support that this great Yajña was begun by me. For the accomplishment of this good rite, you are the final authority. 
viṣṇo tvaṃ karmaṇaḥ sākṣādyajñānāṃ paripālakaḥ | dharmasya vedagarbhasya brahmaṇyastvaṃ ca mādhava || 73 || 	73. O Viṣṇu, you are the protector of holy rites and Yajñas as well as the virtue described in the Vedas. O Mādhava, you are the promoter of Brāhmaṇa’s rites. 
tasmādrakṣā vidhātavyā yajñasyā'sya mahāprabho | dakṣasya vacanaṃ śrutvā uvāca madhusūdanaḥ || 74 || 	74. Hence, O great Lord, proper protection should be accorded to this Yajña.” On hearing the words of Dakṣa, the slayer of Madhu (Viṣṇu) replied:[8] 
mayā rakṣā vidhātavyā dharmasya paripālane | tatsatyaṃ tu tvayoktaṃ hi kiṃ tu tasya vyatikramaḥ || 75 || yātastvadyaiva yajñasya yattvayoktaṃ sadāśivam | naimiṣe'nimiṣakṣetre tadā kiṃ na smṛtaṃ tvayā || 76 || 	75-76. “When you say that protection should be accorded by me to maintain holy rites, it is true. But the transgression is of your own doing in regard to this Yajña. You said something to Sadāśiva in the Naimiṣa forest, the holy spot of Devas. Is it not remembered by you? 
yo'yaṃ rudro mahātejā yajñarūpaḥ sadāśivaḥ | yajñabāhyaḥ kṛto mūḍha tacca durmmatritaṃ tava || 77 || rudrakopācca ko hyatra samartho rakṣaṇe tava | na paśyāmi ca taṃ vipra tvāṃ vai rakṣati durmmatim || 78 || 	77-78. Rudra, Sadāśiva, who has great splendour, who is of the form of Yajña, was [excluded from the Yajñas, O deluded one. That was the wrong advice of yours. Who is competent to protect you from Rudra’s wrath? I do not see anyone, O Brāhmaṇa, who can protect you, the evil-minded one. 
kiṃ karmma kimakarmmeti tanna paśyasi durmmate | samarthaṃ kevalaṃ karmana bhaviṣyati sarvadā || 79 || 	79. You do not distinguish between good and evil acts, O evil-minded one. A holy rite alone is not (necessarily) efficacious always (to produce results). 
seśvaraṃ karma viddhyotatsamarthatvena jāyate | na hyanyaḥ karmmaṇo dātā īśvareṇa vinā bhavet || 80 || 	80. Understand that a holy rite with the support of Īśvara (Śiva) is competent to produce results. Excepting Īśvara, there is no other bestower of the fruit of Karman (a holy rite). 
īśvarasya ca ye bhaktāḥ śāṃtāstadgatamānasāḥ | karmmaṇo hi phalaṃ teṣāṃ prayacchati sadāśivaḥ || 81 || 	81. Sadāśiva grants the benefit of the holy rites of those persons who are the devotees of Īśvara, who are calm and whose minds dwell on him. 
kevalaṃ karma cāśritya nirīśvaraparā janāḥ | nirayaṃ te ca gacchaṃti koṭiyajñaśatairapi || 82 || 	82. Those people who solely depend upon Karman and are engaged in denying Īśvara, go to hell even if they perform hundred crores of Yajñas. 
punaḥ karmamayaiḥ pāśairbaddhā janmanijanmani | nirayeṣu prapacyaṃte kevalaṃ karmmarūpiṇaḥ || 83 || 	83. Those who put faith in the Karmans alone are bound by the fetters of Karman in birth after birth. They are roasted and cooked in the hells.” FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES:

Viṣṇu’s reply is thus remarkable.[Sanskrit text for this chapter is available] 
lomaśa uvāca | viṣṇunoktaṃ vacaḥ śrutvā dakṣo vacanamabravīt | vedānāmapramāṇaṃ ca kṛtaṃ te madhusūdana || 1 || 	Lomaśa said: 1. On hearing the words uttered by Viṣṇu, Dakṣa spoke these words: “O slayer of Madhu (Viṣṇu), you have made it appear that Vedas are not authoritative (pramāṇa).[1] 
vaidikaṃ karma cotsṛjya kathaṃ seśvaratāṃ vrajet | taducyatāṃ mahāviṣṇo yena dharmaḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ || 2 || 	2. How can one forsake the Vedic rite and accept the doctrine of the authoritativeness of Īśvara? Let this be explained, O Mahāviṣṇu, by whom Dharma has been established?” 
dakṣeṇokto mahāviṣṇuruvāca parisāṃtvayan | traigaṇyaviṣayā vedāḥ saṃbhavaṃti na cānyathā || 3 || vedoditāni karmāṇi īśvareṇa vinā katham | saphalāni bhaviṣyaṃti viphalānyeva tāni ca || 4 || 	3-5. On being asked by Dakṣa, Mahāviṣṇu said to him consolingly: “The Vedas have the three Guṇas for their object.[2] They cannot be otherwise. How can the rites mentioned in the Vedas become fruitful without Īśvara? They definitely become fruitless. Hence seek refuge in Īśvara by all means.” 
tasmātsarvaprayatnena īśvaraṃ śaraṇaṃ vraaijā | evaṃ bruvati govinda āgataḥ sainyasāgaraḥ | vīrabhadreṇa sadṛśo dadṛśustaṃ tadā surāḥ || 5 || 	Even as Govinda (Viṣṇu) was saying thus, the ocean of an army, similar to Vīrabhadra’s came there. All the Suras (Devas) saw it. 
iṃdropi prahasanviṣṇumātmavādarataṃ tadā | vajrapāṇiḥ suraiḥ sārddhaṃ yoddhukāmo'bhavattadā || 6 || 	6. Indra laughed at Viṣṇu,who was engaged in explaining the doctrine of Ātman then. With the Vajra (thunderbolt) in his hand, he became desirous of fighting, accompanied by the Suras. 
bhṛguṇācāritaḥ śīghramuccāṭanapareṇa hi | tadā gaṇāḥ suraiḥ sārdhaṃ yuyudhuste gaṇānvitāḥ || 7 || 	7. He was made to go hurriedly by Bhṛgu who was bent upon routing (the Gaṇas). Then, the Gaṇas in the formation of groups fought with the Suras. 
śaratomaranāgacairjaghnuste ca parasparam | neduḥśaṃkhāśca bahuśastasminraṇamahotsave || 8 || 	8. They struck one another with arrows, iron clubs and sharp-pointed missiles. In the course of that great festival of war, many conchs were blown. 
tathā dundubhayo neduḥ paṭahā ḍiṃḍimādayaḥ | tena śabdena mahatāślāghyamānāstadā surāḥ | lokapālaiśca sahitā jaghnustāñchivakiṃkarān || 9 || 	9. So also drums like Dundubhis, Paṭahas, Diṇḍimas etc., were sounded. Thanks to that great sound, the.Suras considered themselves flattered. Accompanied by the Guardians of the Quarters, they killed the servants of Śiva. 
khaḍgaiścāpi hatāḥ kecidgadābhiśca vipothitāḥ | devaiḥ parājitāḥ sarve gaṇāḥ śatasahasraśaḥ || 10 || 	10. Some were killed by means of swords. Some were smashed by means of iron clubs. All of the hundreds and thousands of the Gaṇas were entirely routed by the Devas. 
iṃdrādyaurlokapālaiśca gaṇāste ca parāṅgamukhāḥ | kṛtāśca tatkṣaṇādeva bhṛgormaṃtrabalena hi || 11 || 	11. It was by the power of the Mantras of Bhṛgu, that those Gaṇas were instantaneously defeated and driven back by the Guardians of the Quarters headed by Indra. 
uccāṭanaṃ kṛtaṃ teṣāṃ bhṛguṇā yajvinā tadā | yajanārthaṃ ca devānāṃ tuṣṭyarthaṃ dīkṣitasya ca || 12 || 	12. Their extermination was effected by Bhṛgu who performed the Yāga as the fire-worshipper. He was initiated in this for the sake of the worship, on behalf of the Devas and for their pleasure too. 
tenaiva devā jayino jātāstatkṣaṇameva hi | svānāṃ parājayaṃ dṛṣṭvā vīrabhadro rupānvitaḥ || 13 || 	13. By that alone did the Devas become victorious at the very instant. On seeing the defeat of his own army, Vīrabhadra became angry. 
bhūtānpretānpiśācāṃśca kṛtvā tāneva pṛṣṭhataḥ | vṛṣabhasthānpuraskṛtya svayaṃ caiva mahābalaḥ | tīkṣṇaṃ triśūlamādāya pātayāmāsa tānraṇe || 14 || devānyakṣānpiśācāṃśca guhyakānrākṣasāṃ stathā | śūlaghātaiśca te sarve gaṇā devānprajaghnire || 15 || 	14-15. He made the goblins, ghosts and vampires go to the rear and the bull-riders advance at the front. The leader of great strength took up a sharp trident and struck down the Devas, Yakṣas, Piśācas, Guḥyakas and Rākṣasas in the battle. Striking with spears, all the Gaṇas began to kill the Devas. 
keciddvidhākṛtāḥ khaṅgairmudgaraiścāpi pothitāḥ | paraśvadhaiḥ khaṃḍaśaśca kṛtāḥ kecidraṇājire || 16 || 	16. Some of them were split into two by means of swords. They were smashed with iron clubs. In the course of the battle, some were cut into pieces with battle-axes. 
śūlairbhinnāśca śataśaḥ kecicca śakalīkṛtāḥ | evaṃ parājitāḥ sarve palāyanaparāyaṇāḥ || 17 || 	17. Hundreds were pierced with spears; some were torn to pieces. Thus, all of those being defeated, began to run away. 
parasparaṃ pariṣvajya gatāstepi triviṣṭapam | kevalaṃ lokapālāśca iṃdrādyāstasthurutsukāḥ | bṛhaspatiṃ pṛcchamānāḥ kutosmākaṃ jayo bhavet || 18 || 	18. Embracing each other, they went back to heaven. Only the guardians of the worlds led by Indra remained there, eager (to fight). They consulted Bṛhaspati, “How can we have victory?” 
bṛhaspatiruvācedaṃ sureṃdraṃ tvaritastadā | bṛhaspatiruvāca | yaduktaṃ viṣṇunā pūrvaṃ tatsatyaṃ jātamadya vai || 19 || 	19-22. Bṛhaspati immediately replied to Indra thus: Bṛhaspati said: What had been spoken by Viṣṇu formerly has become true today. 
asti cedīśvaraḥ kaścitphalarūpyasya karmmaṇaḥ | kartāraṃ bhajate sopi na hyakartuḥ prabhurhisaḥ || 20 || na maṃtrauṣadhayaḥ sarve nābhicārā na laukikāḥ | na karmāṇi na vedāśca na mīmāṃsādvayaṃ tathā || 21 || jñātumīśāḥ saṃbhavaṃti bhaktyājñeyastvananyayā | śāṃtyā ca parayā tṛṣṭyā jñātavyo hi sadāśivaḥ || 22 || 	If there is īśvara as (bestower of) the benefit of a holy rite, he assigns it (the benefit) to the performer (of the rite). He is not powerful over one who does not perform (the rite). Neither Mantras nor all the medicinal herbs, neither black magic nor secular rites, neither holy rites nor the Vedas, nor the two systems of Mīmāṃsā are capable of understanding īśvara. He can be known only through unswerving devotion. By calmness and great contentment, Sadāśiva should (i.e. could) be known. 
tena sarvaṃ saṃbhavaṃti sukhaduḥjhakhātmakaṃ jagat | paraṃtu saṃvadiṣyāmi kāryākāryavivakṣayā || 23 || 	23. It is through him that the entire universe with happiness and misery as its characteristic features, takes its origin. But I shall speak further with a desire to explain (what are the) right and wrong actions. 
tvamiṃdra bāliśo bhūtvā lokapālaiḥ sahādya vai | āgato bāliśo bhūtvā idānīṃ kiṃ kariṣyasi || 24 || 	24. O Indra, you have been foolish in accompanying the (other) guardians of the worlds here. What can you do further now with the self-same folly? 
ete rudrasahāyāśca gaṇāḥ paramaśobhanāḥ | kupitāśca mahābhāgā na tu śeṣaṃ prakurvate || 25 || 	25. These extremely splendid Gaṇas, the assistants of Rudra, have become infuriated. Those persons of exalted fortune cause nothing to be left over. 
evaṃ bṛhaspatervākyaṃ śrutvā te'pi divaukasaḥ | ciṃtāmāpedire sarve lokapālā maheśvarāḥ || 26 || 	26. On hearing these words of Bṛhaspati, all the heaven-dwellers and all those great gods, the guardians of the worlds, became anxious. 
tato'bravīdvīrabhadro gaṇaiḥ parivṛto bhṛśam | sarve yūyaṃ bāliśatvādavadānārthamāgatāḥ || 27 || 	27-28. Then Vīrabhadra who was very closely surrounded by the Gaṇas, said: 
avadānāni dāsyāmi tṛptyarthaṃ bhavatāṃ tvaran | evamuktvā śitairbāṇairjaghānātha ruṣānvitaḥ || 28 || 	“On account of your ignorant nature, you have come here for the sake of Avadāna (glorious achievement). For the sake of your satisfaction, I shall immediately give you Avadānas (cutting into pieces).” After saying this, he furiously hit them with sharp arrows. 
tairbāṇairnihatāḥ sarve jagmuste ca diśo daśa || 29 || 	29. Hit by those arrows, all of them fled in all the ten directions. 
gateṣu lokapāleṣu vidruteṣu sureṣu ca | yajñavāṭe samāyāto vīrabhadro gaṇānvataḥ || 30 || 	30. When the guardians of the worlds had left the place and when the Devas had fled, Vīrabhadra came into the sacrificial enclosure accompanied by the Gaṇas. 
tadā ta ṛṣayaḥ sarve sarvameveśvareśvaram | vijñaptukāmāḥ sahasā ūcurevaṃ janārdanam || 31 || 	31. At that time all those sages who were desirous of intimating everything to Janārdana (Viṣṇu), the god of gods, said to him all at once: 
rakṣa yajñaṃ hi dakṣasya yajñosi tvaṃ na saṃśayaḥ | etacchrutvā tu vacanamṛṣīṇāṃ vai janārdanaḥ || 32 || 	32-33. “Protect the Yajña of Dakṣa. Indeed, there is no doubt that you are Yajña incarnate.” 
yoddhukāmaḥ sthito yuddhe viṣṇuradhyātmadīpakaḥ | vīrabhadro mahābāhuḥ keśavaṃ vākyamabravīt || 33 || 	On hearing these words of the sages, Janārdana, the all-pervading lord, the illuminator of spiritual faculties, became desirous of fighting and stood there ready for the battle. Vīrabhadra of powerful arms spoke these words to Keśava (Viṣṇu): 
atra tvayāgataṃ kasmādviṣṇo vettrā mahābalam | dakṣasya pakṣamāśritya kathaṃ jeṣyasi tadvada || 34 || 	34. “Why have you come here, O Viṣṇu, you who know the great strength (of mine)? How will you be victorious by taking up Dakṣa’s side? Tell me that. 
dākṣāyaṇyā kṛtaṃ yacca na dṛṣṭaṃ kiṃ tvayānagha | tvaṃ cāpi yajñe dakṣasya avadānārthamāgataḥ | avadānaṃ prayacchāmi tava cāpi mahābhūja || 35 || 	35. Did you not observe? What has been done by Dākṣāyaṇī, O sinless one? You too have come for the sake of a share in the course of the Yajña of Dakṣa. O lord of powerful arms, I shall give oblation to you also.” 
evamuktvā praṇamyādau viṣṇuṃ sadṛśarūpiṇam | vīrabhadro'grato bhūtvā viṣṇuṃ vākyamathābravīt || 36 || 	36. After saying this, at the very outset, he bowed down to Viṣṇu whose form was similar to his. Vīrabhadra then went in front of Viṣṇu and spoke these words: 
yathā śaṃbhustathā tvaṃ hi mama nāstyatra saṃśayaḥ | tathāpi tvaṃ mahābāho yoddhukāmo'grataḥ stitaḥ | neṣyāmyapunarāvṛttiṃ yadi tiṣṭhestvamātmanā || 37 || 	37. “You are to me just like Śaṃbhu.[3] There is no doubt about this. Still, O lord of powerful arms, you face me with a desire to fight. If you continue to stay here yourself, I shall give you liberation (Apunarāvṛtti).” 
tasya tadvacanaṃ śrutvā vīrabhadrasya dhīmataḥ | uvāca prahasandevo viṣṇuḥ sarveśvareśvaraḥ || 38 || 	38. On hearing those words of the intelligent Vīrabhadra lord Viṣṇu, the lord of all lords, said laughingly: Viṣṇu said: 
viṣṇuruvāca | rudratejaḥprasūtosi pavitro'si mahāmate | anena prārthitaḥ pūrvaṃ yajñārthaṃ ca punaḥ punaḥ || 39 || ahaṃ bhaktaparādhīnastathā so'pi maheśvaraḥ | tenaiva kāraṇenātra dakṣasya yajanaṃ prati || 40 || āgato'haṃ vīrabhadra rudrakopasamudbhava | ahaṃ nivārayāmi tvāṃ tvaṃ vā māṃ vinivāraya || 41 || 	39-41. O highly intelligent one, you are born of the splendour of Rudra. You are very pure and holy. I had been requested by this (Dakṣa) before repeatedly for attending this Yajña. I am subservient to my devotees. So also is the case of Maheśvara. It is for that reason that I have come to this sacrifice of Dakṣa, O Vīrabhadra, born of the wrath of Rudra. Either I shall restrain you or you shall restrain me. 
ityuktavati goviṃde prahasya sa mahābhujaḥ | praśrayāvanato bhūtvā idamāha janārdanam || 42 || 	42. When Govinda said this much, that (Vīrabhadra) of mighty arms laughed and after bowing down humbly said this to Janārdana (Viṣṇu): 
yathā śivastathā tvaṃ hi yathā tvaṃ ca tathā śivaḥ | sevakāśca vayaṃ sarve tava vā śaṃkarasya ca || 43 || 	43. “Just as Śiva, so also you. Just as you, so also Śiva. All of us are servants both of you and of Śaṅkara.” 
tacchrutvā vacanaṃ tasya so'cyutaḥ saṃprahasya ca | idaṃ viṣṇurmahāvākyaṃ jagāda parameśvaraḥ || 44 || 	44. On hearing his words, Acyuta, Viṣṇu, the greatest lord, spoke these important words laughingly: 
yodhayasva mahābāho mayā sārdhamaśaṃkitaḥ | tavāstraiḥ pūryamāṇo'haṃ gacchāmi bhavanaṃ svakam || 45 || 	45. “Fight with me unhesitatingly, O lord of powerful arms. I shall go to my own abode when I am surfeited with your arrows and missiles.” 
tathetyuktvā tu vīro'sau vīrabhadro mahābalaḥ | gṛhītvā paramāstrāṇi siṃhanādairjagarja ha || 46 || 	46. Saying “so be it”, Vīrabhadra, the hero of great strength, took up the greatest of his missiles and roared like a lion. 
viṣṇuścāpi mahāghoṣaṃ śaṃkhanādaṃ cakāra saḥ | tacchrutvā ye gatā devā raṇaṃ hitvā'yayuḥ punaḥ || 47 || 	47. Viṣṇu too blew his conch of loud report. On hearing it, those Devas who had fled away from the battlefield, returned once again. 
vyūhaṃ cakrustadā sarve lokapālāḥ savāsavāḥ | tadendreṇa hato naṃdīvajreṇa śataparvaṇā || 48 || naṃdīnā ca hataḥ śakrastriśūlena stanāṃtare | vāyunā ca hato bhṛṃgī bhṛṃgiṇā vāyurāhataḥ || 49 || śūlena sitadhāreṇa saṃnaddho daṇḍadhāriṇā | yamena saha saṃgrāmaṃ mahākālo balānvitaḥ || 50 || 	48-50. All the Guardians of the Quarters including Indra made an array (of their soldiers). Then Nandin was struck by Indra with his Vajra (thunderbolt) that had a hundred spikes. Śakra was hit in the middle of his chest by Nandin with his trident. Bhṛṅgī was struck by Vāyu and Vāyu was struck (in return) by Bhṛṅgī. Standing well prepared with his trident of sharp edge, Mahākāla, endowed with great strength, fought with Yama holding the heavy rod. 
kubereṇa ca saṃgamya kūṣmāṃḍānāṃ patiḥ svayam | varuṇena samaṃ yuddhaṃ muṃḍaścaiva mahābalaḥ || 51 || yuyudhe parayāśaktyā trailokyaṃ vismayanniva | nairṛtena samāgamya caṃḍaścabalavattaraḥ || 52 || yuyudhe paramāstreṇa nairṛtyaṃ ca viḍaṃbayan | yoginīcakrasaṃyukto bhairavo nāyako mahān || 53 || 	51-55. The lord of Kūṣmāṇḍas clashed with Kubera. Muṇḍa of great strength fought with Varuṇa. He fought with such a great strength as surprised the three worlds. The exceedingly powerful Caṇḍa clashed with Nirṛta and fought with a very great missile, mocking his demoniac nature. Bhairava, the great leader, accompanied by the circle of Yoginīs tore through all the Devas and drank their wonderful blood. All the Kṣetrapālas, Bhūtas, Pramathas, Guhyakas, Śākinīs, Ḍakinīs, the terrible nine Durgās, Yoginīs, Yātudhānīs, Kūṣmāṇḍakas and others roared, drank blood and devoured a lot of flesh. 
bhakṣyamāṇaṃ tadā sainyaṃ vilokya surarāṭsvayam | vihāya naṃdinaṃ paścādvīrabhadraṃ samākṣipat || 56 || 	56. On seeing that his army was being devoured, the king of Suras left Nandin behind and challenged Vīrabhadra. 
vīrabhadro vihāyaiva viṣṇuṃ devendramāsthitaḥ | tayoryuddhamabhūddhoraṃ budhāṃgārakayoriva || 57 || 	57. Leaving off Viṣṇu, Vīrabhadra engaged Devendra. The battle between them was as terrible as that between Mars and Mercury. 
vīrabhadraṃ yadā śakro haṃtukāmastvarānvitaḥ | tāvacchaṃkraṃ gajasthaṃ hi purayāmāsa mārgaṇaiḥ || 58 || vīrabhadro ruṣāviṣṭo durnivāryo mahābalaḥ | tadedreṃṇāhataḥ śīghraṃ vajreṇa śataparvaṇā || 59 || sagajaṃ ca savajraṃ ca vāsavaṃ grastumudyutaḥ | hāhākāro mahā nāsīdbhūtānāṃ tatra paśyatām || 60 || 	58-61. When Śakra was desirous of killing Vīrabhadra and hastily prepared for the same, Vīrabhadra became furious and filled Indra who was seated on his elephant, with a mass of arrows. The extremely mighty Vīrabhadra who was unrestrainable, was immediately struck by Indra with his Vajra of a hundred spikes. Then he (Vīrabhadra) attempted to swallow Indra along with his elephant and thunderbolt. All the Bhūtas who saw Vīrabhadra like that desirous of killing Indra, raised the loud shouts of “Hā-Hā” (Alas-AIas). Seeing Vīrabhadra desirous of killing Indra, Viṣṇu came there in a hurry and stood in front of Vīrabhadra. 
śakraṃ ca pṛṣṭhataḥ kṛtvā yodhayāmāsa vai tadā | vīrabhadrasya viṣṇośca yuddhaṃ paramabhūttadā || 62 || 	62. He pushed Śakra behind and fought with Vīrabhadra. The battle between them was very tough. 
śastrāstrairvividhākārairyodhayāmāsatustadā | punarnaṃdinamālokya śakro yuddha viśāradaḥ || 63 || 	63-64. They then fought with various kinds of weapons and missiles. Seeing Nandin once again, Śakra who was an expert in battle, engaged him in a tumultuous duel. 
dvaṃdvayuddhaṃ sutumulaṃ devānāṃ pramathaiḥ saha | pramathā mathitā devaiḥ sarve te prādravanraṇāt || 64 || 	There was a great clash between Devas and Pramathas. Pramathas were smashed by Devas and all of them fled from the battle. 
gaṇānparāṅmukhāndṛṣṭvā sarve te vyādhayo bhṛśam | rudrakopātsamudbhūtā devāścāpi pradudruvuḥ || 65 || 	65. On seeing the Gaṇas turning their faces away (from the battle), all those (bacterial) ailments[4] that had originated from the fury of Rudra rushed against Devas. 
jvaraistu pīḍitāndevāndṛṣṭvā viṣṇurhasanniva | jīvagrāheṇa jagrāha devāṃstāṃśca pṛthakpṛthak || 66 || 	66. On seeing Devas afflicted with the fevers, Viṣṇu laughingly seized Devas alive separately. 
devāścinau tadāhūya vyādhīnhaṃtuṃ tadā bhṛtim | dadau tābhyāṃ prayatnena gaṇayitvā subuddhimān || 67 || 	67. He called Aśvinī Devas in order to quell the ailments. The highly intelligent (lord) made them carefully work out and consider the requisite nourishment (medicine) and sustenance, and gave the same to them. 
jvarāṃśca sannipātāṃśca anye bhūtadruhastadā | tānsarvānnigṛhītvātha aśvinau tau mudānvitau | vijvarānatha devāṃśca kṛtvā mumudatuściram || 68 || 	68. Aśvinī gods caught hold of the fevers and Sannipāta (fevers) as well as other inimical elements and quelled them. They joyously made Devas free from fever and rejoiced for a long time. 
tairjitaṃ yoginīcakraṃ bhairavaṃ vyākulīkṛtam | tīkṣṇāgraiḥ pātayāmāsuḥ śarairbhūtagaṇānapi || 69 || 	69. The Yoginī Cakra also was subdued by them. With sharp-pointed arrows, they toppled down Bhairava who was highly excited and felled the Gaṇas too. 
surairvidrāvitaṃ sainyaṃ vilokya patitaṃ bhuvi | vīrabhadro rupāviṣṭo viṣṇuṃ vacanamabravīt || 70 || 	70. On seeing his army routed by Suras and felled down by them, Vīrabhadra became furious and spoke these words to Viṣṇu: 
tvaṃ śūrosi mahābāho devānāṃ pālako hyasi | yudhyasva māṃ prayatnena yadi te matirīdṛśī || 71 || 	71. “You are a heroic warrior, O mighty one. Indeed you are the protector of Devas. If you think so, come on, fight with me strenuously.” 
ityuktvā taṃ samāsādya viṣṇuṃ sarveśvareśvaram | vavarṣa niśitairbāṇairvīrabhadro mahābalaḥ || 72 || 	72. After saying thus, Vīrabhadra of great strength, approached Viṣṇu, the lord of all lords, and showered him with sharp arrows. 
tadā cakreṇa bhagavānvīrabhadraṃ jaghāna saḥ | āyāṃtaṃ cakramālokya grasitaṃ tatkṣaṇācca tat || 73 || 	73. Then the lord attacked Vīrabhadra with his discus. On seeing the discus coming, it was instantaneously swallowed (by Vīrabhadra). 
grasitaṃ cakramālokya viṣṇuḥ parapuraṃjayaḥ | mukhaṃ tasya parāmṛjya viṣṇunodgilitaṃ punaḥ || 74 || 	74-75. On seeing that his discus was swallowed, Viṣṇu, the conqueror of the cities of his enemies, stroked and pressed his mouth. Thus the (discus) was caused to be spitted out by Viṣṇu. 
svacakramādāya mahānubhāvo divaṃ gato'tho bhuvanaikabhartā | jñātvā ca tatsarvamidaṃ ca viṣṇuḥ kṛtī kṛtaṃ duṣprasahaṃ pareṣām || 75 || 	Taking his discus, Viṣṇu of exalted nature, the sole lord of the universe, went to heaven. On understanding everything that had been done and was unbearable to the enemies he became-satisfied (of having done his job). FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES: This shows a stage of conflict between the traditional Vedic religion and Śaivism. Vedic tradition prohibited its followers from even speaking with the non-Vedic Śaivas and Pañcarātras. These Śāstras were regarded as authoritative so far as they are not opposed to the Vedas (Sūta-Saṃhitā IV.4.16-18). Pārijāta as quoted in the Kṛtyaratnākara (p. 37) states the view of the mediaeval writers on Dharma Śāstra as follows: 
lomaśa uvāca | viṣṇau gate tadā sarve devāśca ṛṣibhiḥ saha | vinirjitā gaṇaiḥ sarve ye ca yajñopajīvinaḥ || 1 || 	An imaginative precursor of modern bacterial warfare?[Sanskrit text for this chapter is available] Lomaśa continued: 1. When Viṣṇu went away, all those Devas along with the sages and all those who subsisted on that Yajña were totally vanquished by the Gaṇas. 
bhṛguṃ ca pātayāmāsa smaśrūṇāṃ luṃcanaṃ kṛtam | dvijāṃścotpāṭayāmāsa pūṣṇo vikṛtavikriyān || 2 || 	2. He (Vīrabhadra) made Bhṛgu fall down and his beard and moustache were plucked and cut.[1] He got the teeth of Pūṣan uprooted after distorting and deforming them. 
viḍaṃbitā svadhā tatra ṛṣayaśca viḍaṃbitāḥ | vavṛṣuste purīṣeṇa vitānāgnau rupānvitāḥ || 3 || 	3. Svadhā was ridiculed and the sages were mocked there. In their fury, they showered the sacrificial fire with faecal matter. 
anirvācyaṃ tadā cakrurgaṇāḥ krodhasamanvitāḥ | aṃtarvedyaṃtaragato dakṣo vai mahato bhayāt || 4 || 	4. The Gaṇas who had become excessively infuriated created unspeakable havoc. Out of great fear, Dakṣa hid himself beneath the altar. 
taṃ nilīnaṃ samājñāya ānināyaruṣānvitaḥ | kapoleṣu gṛhītvā taṃ khaḍgenopahataṃ śiraḥ || 5 || 	5. After realizing that he was in hiding, he angrily dragged him out. Holding by the cheeks, he struck his head with a sword. 
abhedyaṃ tacchiro matvā vīrabhadraḥ pratāpavān | skaṃdhaṃ padbhyāṃ samākramya kadhare'pīḍayattadā || 6 || 	6. Thinking that the head could not be pierced or split through, the valorous Vīrabhadra pressed the shoulder down with his feet and wrung the neck. 
gaṃdharātpāṭyamānācca śiraśchinnaṃ durātmanaḥ | dakṣasya ca tadā tena vīrabhadreṇa dhīmatā | tacchiraḥ suhutaṃ kuṃḍe jvali || 7 || 	7. On being wrenched off from the neck, the head of the vicious Dakṣa was taken away by the intelligent Vīrabhadra and thrown (lit. offered as oblation) into the blazing sacrificial pit instantaneously. 
ye cānya ṛṣayo devāḥ pitaro yakṣarākṣasāḥ | gaṇairupadrutāḥ sarve palāyanaparā yayuḥ || 8 || 	8. Other sages, Devas, Pitṛs, Yakṣas and Rākṣasas who yet stayed on were assaulted by the Gaṇas. All of them fled from the place. 
caṃdrādityagaṇāḥ sarve grahanakṣatratārakāḥ | sarve vicalitā hyāsangaṇaistepi hyupadrutāḥ || 9 || 	9. The Moon, the groups of Ādityas, all the Planets, Stars and Constellations—all of them were displaced and shaken. They too were attacked by the Gaṇas. 
satyalokaṃ gato brahmā putraśokena pīḍitaḥ | ciṃtayāmāsa cāvyagraḥ kiṃ kāryaṃ kāryamadya vai || 10 || 	10. Brahmā returned to Satyaloka. He was afflicted with sorrow for his son. He thought without being perturbed: ‘What action is to be taken now?’ 
manasā dūyamānena śaṃna lebhe pitāmahaḥ | jñātvā sarvaṃ prayatnena duṣkṛtaṃ tasya pāpinaḥ || 11 || gamanāya matiṃ cakre kailāsaṃ parvataṃ prati | haṃsārūḍho mahātejāḥ sarvadevaiḥ samanvitaḥ || 12 || 	11-15. As his mind was suffering, the grandfather of the worlds did not derive any happiness. With great effort, he understood all the wicked deeds of that sinner. He decided to go to the Kailāsa mountain. 
praviṣṭaḥ parvataśreṣṭhaṃ sa dadarśa sadāśivam | ekāṃtavāsinaṃ rudraṃ śailādena samanvitam || 13 || 	Hiding on his swan, accompanied by all the Devas, the lord of great splendour reached the most excellent mountain. There he saw Śiva, Rudra, accompanied by only Nandin, staying alone. 
kaparddinaṃ śriyā yuktaṃ vedāṃgānāṃ ca durgamam | tathāvidhaṃ samālokya brahma kṣobhaparo'bhavat || 14 || 	He had matted hair and possessed great splendour. It was the lord who could not he grasped by the Vedas or their Aṅgas (Ancillaries). On seeing such a lord, Brahmā became greatly agitated. 
daṃḍavatpatito bhūmaukṣamāpayitumudyataḥ | saṃspṛśaṃ statpadābjaṃ ca caturmukuṭakoṭibhiḥ | stutiṃ kartuṃ samārebhe śivasya paramātmanaḥ || 15 || 	He prostrated himself on the ground like a staff and began to plead for pardon, touching his lotus-like feet with the tips of the four crowns. He began to eulogize Śiva, the supreme soul. 
brahmovāca | namo rudrāya śāṃtāya brahmaṇe paramātmane | tvaṃ hi viśvasṛjāṃ sraṣṭā dhātā tvaṃ prapitāmahaḥ || 16 || 	Brahmā said: 16. Obeisance to Rudra, the quiescent Brahman, the supreme soul. You are the creator and sustainer (protector) of the universe; you are the great-grandfather (of the world). 
namo rudrāya mahate nīlakaṃṭhāya vedhase | viśvāya viśvabījāya jagadānaṃdahetave || 17 || 	17. Obeisance to the great Rudra, to the blue-throated one, to the creator, to the lord identical with the universe, to the seed of the universe, to the cause of the bliss of the worlds. 
oṃkārastvaṃ vaṣaṭkāraḥ sarvāraṃbhapravartakaḥ | yajñosi yajñakarmāsi yajñānāṃ ca pravartakaḥ || 18 || sarveṣāṃ yajñakartṝṇāṃ tvameva pratipālakaḥ | śaraṇyosi mahādeva sarveṣāṃ prāṇināṃ prabho | rakṣa rakṣa mahādeva putraśokena pīḍitam || 19 || 	18-19. You are Oṃkāra; you are Vaṣaṭkāra, the prompter of the functioning of all enterprises. You are Yajña; you are the Yājñic rite. You are the cause of the functioning of Yajña; you alone are the protector of all the performers of sacrifice. You are worthy of being the refuge, O great lord, to all living beings. Save me, save me, O lord Mahādeva, I have been afflicted with the grief for my son. 
mahādeva uvāca | śrṛṇuṣvāvahito bhūtvā mama vākyaṃ pitāmaha | dakṣasya yajñabhaṃgoyaṃ na kṛtaśca mayā kvacit || 20 || 	Mahādeva said: 20. O grandfather, listen attentively to my words. The destruction of the Yajña of Dakṣa has Dot been carried out by me at all. 
svīyena karmaṇā dakṣo hato brahmanna saṃśayaḥ || 21 || pareṣāṃ kleśadaṃ karma na kāryaṃ tatkadācana | parameṣṭhinpareṣāṃ yadātmanastadbhaviṣyati || 22 || 	21-22. O Brahmā, there is no doubt about this that Dakṣa was killed by his own deeds. An act (rite) that causes pain to many others, should not be performed at all, at any time. O Parameṣṭhin, what befalls others will befall one too. 
evamuktvā tadā rudro brahmaṇā sahitaḥ suraiḥ | yayau kanakhalaṃ tīrthaṃ yajñavāṭaṃ prajāpateḥ || 23 || 	23. After saying this, Rudra accompanied by Brahmā and Suras went to the holy spot Kanakhala and to the sacrificial enclosure of the Prajāpati (Dakṣa). 
rudrastadā dadarśāya vīrabhadreṇa yatkṛtam | svāhā svadhā tathā pūṣā bhṛgurmatimatāṃ varaḥ || 24 || tadānya ṛṣayaḥ sarve pitaraśca tathāvidhāḥ | ye'nye ca bahavastatra yakṣagaṃdharvakinnarāḥ || 25 || troṭitā luṃcitāścaiva mṛtāḥ kecidraṇājire || 26 || 	24-26. Rudra saw what had been committed by Vīrabhadra. Svāhā, Svadhā, Pūṣan, Bhṛgu the most excellent one among intelligent beings (all had been injured by the Gaṇas). So also all the other sages and all the manes had been driven to that miserable plight. Many other Yakṣas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras who had been there were wounded, split and torn oīf. Some died in the battle. 
śaṃbhuṃ samāgataṃ dṛṣṭvā vīrabhadro gaṇaiḥ saha | daṃḍapraṇāmasaṃyuktastasthāvagre sadāśivam || 27 || 	27. On seeing that Śaṃbhu had come, Vīrabhadra prostrated himself like a log of wood by way of obeisance, along with his Gaṇas. Then he stood in front of Śiva. 
dṛṣṭvā puraḥ sthitaṃ rudro vīrabhadraṃ mahābalam | upāca prahasanvākyaṃ kiṃ kṛtaṃ vīra nanvidam || 28 || 	28. On seeing Vīrabhadra of great strength standing in front, Rudra spoke these words laughingly: “O hero, what is this that has been done here? 
dakṣamānaya śīghraṃ bho yenedaṃ kṛtamīdṛśam | yajñe vilakṣaṇaṃ tāta yasyedaṃ phalamīdṛśam || 29 || 	29. Immediately bring here that Dakṣa by whom this unusual and inauspicious thing has been committed in the course of a Yajña, in consequence of which was (the present) fruit.” 
evamuktaḥ śaṃkareṇa vīrabhadrastvarānvitaḥ | kabaṃdhamānayitvātha śaṃbhoragre tadākṣipat || 30 || 	30. On being ordered thus by Śaṅkara, Vīrabhadra hurriedly brought the headless trunk and placed it in front of Śaṃbhu. 
tadoktaḥ śaṃkareṇaiva vīrabhadro mahāmanāḥ | śiraḥ kenā panītaṃ ca dakṣasyāsya durātmanaḥ || 31 || dāsyāmi jīvanaṃ vīra kuṭilasyāpi cādhunā | evamuktaḥ śaṃkareṇa vīrabhadro'bravītpunaḥ || 32 || 	31-32. Then Vīrabhadra of noble mind was enquired by Śaṅkara: “By whom has the head of the vicious Dakṣa been removed? Though he is a crooked fellow, O hero, I shall now give him life (revive him).” On being told thus by Śaṅkara, Vīrabhadra submitted again: 
mayā śiro hutaṃ cāgnau tadānīmeva śaṃkara | avaśiṣṭaṃ śiraḥśaṃbho paśośca vikṛtānanam || 33 || 	33. “The head was dropped by me into the fire at the very instant, O Śaṅkara. The head that is left, O Śaṃbhu, is that of an animal and the face has been distorted.” 
iti jñātvā tato rudraḥ kabaṃdhopari cākṣipat | śiraḥ paśośca vikṛtaṃ kūrcayuktaṃ bhayāvaham || 34 || 	34. After knowing (the position), Rudra placed upon the headless trunk the deformed head of the animal. The head had a beard and it was terrible. 
sa dakṣo jīvitaṃ lebhe prasādācchaṃkarasya ca | sa dṛṣṭvāgre tadā rudraṃ dakṣo lajjāsamanvitaḥ | tuṣṭāva praṇato bhūtvā śaṃkaraṃ lokaśaṃkaram || 35 || 	35. Thanks to the grace of Śaṅkara, Dakṣa regained his life. On seeing Rudra in front of him, Dakṣa became ashamed. Bowing down he eulogized Śaṅkara, the benefactor of all the worlds. 
dakṣa uvāca | namāmi devaṃ varadaṃ vareṇyaṃ namāmi deveśvaraṃ sanātanam | namāmi devādhipamīśvaraṃ haraṃ namāmi śaṃbhuṃ jagadekabaṃdhum || 36 || 	Dakṣa said: 36. I bow down to the excellent lord, the bestower of boons. I bow down to the most excellent lord of Devas, the eternal lord. I pay obeisance to Īśvara, the lord of Devas. I bow down to Hara, Śaṃbhu, the sole kinsman of the universe. 
namāmi viśveśvaraviśvarūpaṃ sanātanaṃ brahma nijātmarūpam | namāmi sarvaṃ nijabhāvabhāvaṃ varaṃ vareṇyaṃ nato'smi || 37 || 	37. I bow down to the cosmic form of the lord of the universe, the eternal Brahman in the form of one’s own soul. I salute Sarva (Śiva) having the existence of one’s own mental creation. I pay obeisance to the excellent one, the bestower of boons. 
lomaśa uvāca | dakṣeṇa saṃstuto rudro babhāṣe prahasanrahaḥ || 38 || 	Lomaśa said: 38. Rudra who was eulogized by Dakṣa, spoke laughingly in secret: Rudra (Hara) said: 
hara uvāca | caturvidhā bhajaṃte māṃ janāḥ sukṛtinaḥ sadā | ārto jijñāsurarthārthī jñānī ca dvijasattama || 39 || 	39. Four types of meritorious people always worship[2] me. They are: (those who are in misery), those who are thirsting for knowledge, the seekers of wealth and the possessors of spiritual knowledge, O excellent Brāhmaṇa. 
tasmānme jñāninaḥ sarve priyāḥ syurnātra saṃśayaḥ | vinā jñānena māṃ prāptuṃ yataṃte te hi bāliśaḥ || 40 || 	40. Hence undoubtedly sages, possessors of true knowledge, are my favourites. Those who strive to attain me without spiritual knowledge are ignorant. 
kevalaṃ karmaṇā tvaṃ hi saṃsārāttartumicchasi || 41 || 	41. Merely by means of Karman (holy rites) you wish to cross the (ocean of) worldly existence. 
na vedaiśca na dānaiśca na yajñaistapasā kvacit | na śaknuvaṃti māṃ prāptuṃ mūḍhāḥ karmmavaśānarāḥ || 42 || 	42. Neither by means of the Vedas nor by means of charitable gifts, neither by sacrifices nor by penance at any place can they attain me.[3] But due to the power of Karman men get deluded. 
tasmājjñānaparo bhūtvā kuru karmma samāhitaḥ | sukhaduḥkhasamo bhūtvā sukhī bhava niraṃtaram || 43 || 	43. Hence, be devoted to knowledge and perform holy rites with concentration and purity of mind. Be equally indifferent to happiness and misery and attain eternal happiness. 
lomaśa uvāca | upadiṣṭastadā tena śaṃbhunā parameṣṭhinā | dakṣaṃ tatraiva saṃsthāpāya yayo rudraḥ svaparvatam || 44 || 	Lomaśa said: 44. Thus Dakṣa was advised by Śaṃbhu, the greatest god. After establishing Dakṣa there itself, Rudra went back to his mountain. 
brahmaṇāpi tathā sarve bhṛgvādyāśca maharṣayaḥ | āśvāsitā bodhitāśca jñāninaścābhavankṣaṇāt || 45 || 	45. Similarly all the great sages beginning with Bhṛgu were consoled and enlightened by Brahmā. Instantaneously they became endowed with true knowledge. 
gataḥ pitāmaho brahmā tataśca sadanaṃ svakam || 46 || 	46. Thereafter Brahmā went to his abode. 
dakṣopi ca svayaṃ vākyātparaṃ bodhamupāgataḥ | śivadhyānaparo bhūtvā tapastepe mahāmanāḥ || 47 || 	47. Dakṣa too achieved the excellent enlightenment through the utterance. Engrossed in the meditation of Śiva, the noble-minded one performed penance. 
tasmātsarvaprayatnena saṃkṣevyo bhagavāñchivaḥ || 48 || 	48. Hence Lord Śiva should be served by means of all possible efforts. 
saṃmārjanaṃ ca kurvaṃti narā ye ca śivāṃgaṇe | te vai śivapuraṃ prāpya jagadvaṃdyā bhagsi ca || 49 || 	49. Those men who sweep the courtyard of Śiva (i.e. Siva’s temple) attain Śiva’s city and become worthy of the praise of the whole universe.[4] 
ye śivasya prayacchati darppaṇaṃ sumahāprabham | bhaviṣyaṃti śivasyāgre pārṣadatvena te narāḥ || 50 || 	50. Those who offer a mirror of great lustre to Śiva become attendants of Śiva and will be standing in front of Śiva. 
cāmarāṇi prayacchaṃti devadevasya śūlinaḥ | cāmarairvījyapānāste bhaviṣyaṃti jagattraya || 51 || 	51. Those who give chowries to the Trident-bearing Lord of Devas will themselves be fanned with chowries in all the three worlds. 
dīpadānaṃ prayacchaṃti mahādevālaye narāḥ | tejasvino bhaviṣyaṃti te trailokyapradīpakā || 52 || 	52. The men who offer lamps to the temple of Mahādeva will become refulgent. They will be the illuminators of the three worlds. 
dhūpaṃ ye vai prayacchanti śivāya paramātmane | yaśasvino bhaviṣyaṃti uddharanti kuladvayam || 53 || 	53. Those who offer incense to Śiva, the great Ātman, will become famous. They redeem both the families (their own as well as that of their mothers). 
naivedyaṃ ye prayacchaṃti bhakayā hariharāgrataḥ | sikthesikthe kratuphalaṃ prāpnuvaṃti hi te narāḥ || 54 || 	54. Those men who offer eatables (Naivedya) in front of Hari and Hara with great devotion, attain the fruit of a sacrifice for every lump of boiled rice offered by them (as Naivedya). 
bhagnaṃ śivālayaṃ ye ca prakurvaṃti narottamāḥ | prāpnuvati phala te vai dviguṇaṃ nātra saṃśayaḥ || 55 || 	55. Those excellent men who repair a Śiva temple in ruins attain two-fold benefit. There is no doubt about it. 
nūtanaṃ ye prakṛrvaṃti iṣṭakairaśmanāpi vā | svarge hi te pramodaṃte yāvattiṣṭhati nirmalam | yaśo bhūmau dvijaśreṣṭhā kāryā vicāraṇā || 56 || 	56. Those who build a new temple by means of bricks or stones rejoice in heaven as long as their spotless fame stays in the world. O excellent brāhmaṇas, no doubt need be entertained about this. 
kārayaṃti ca ye viprāḥ prāsādaṃ bahubhūmikam | śivasyātha mahāprājñāḥ prāpnuvaṃti parāṃ gatim || 57 || 	57. Those highly intelligent brāhmaṇas who cause to build a palatial temple of many floors for Śiva, attain the greatest goal (i.e. Mokṣa). 
śuddhaṃ dhavalitaṃ ye ca kurvanti haramaṃdiram | svīyaṃ parakṛtaṃ cāpi te'pi yāṃti parāṃ gatim || 58 || 	58. Those who clean or whitewash a temple of Śiva built by themselves or by others attain the greatest goal. 
vitānaṃ ye prayacchati narāḥ sukṛtinopi hi | tārayati kulaṃ kṛtsnaṃ śivalokaṃ gatāḥ punaḥ || 59 || 	59. Those who offer a canopy are meritorious men. They go to the world of Śiva and redeem their entire family. 
ye ca nādamayīṃ ghaṃṭāṃ nibadhnaṃti śivālaye | tejasvinaḥ kīrtimaṃto bhaviṣyaṃti jagattraye || 60 || 	60. Those who tie a ringing bell in a temple of Śiva will become refulgent and well reputed in the three worlds. 
ekakālaṃ dvikālaṃ vā trikālaṃ cānupaśyati | āḍhyo vāpi daridro vā sukhaṃ duḥkhātpracucyate || 61 || 	61. He who visits (Śiva’s temple) once, twice or thrice (a day) attains happiness whether he is rich or poor. He gets released from misery. 
śraddhāvānbhajate yo vā śivāya paramātmane | kulakoṭiṃ samuddhṛtya śivena saha modate || 62 || 	62. A religious faithful who offers worships unto Śiva, the great Ātman, redeems ten million members of his family and rejoices in the company of Śiva. 
atraivodāharaṃtīma mitihāsaṃ purātanam | aiṃdradyumneśca saṃvādaṃ yamasya ca mahātmanaḥ || 63 || 	63. In this context they cite this ancient legend,[5] the conversation between the son of Indradyumna and the noble-minded Yama. 
purā kṛtayuge hyasīdindraseno narādhipaḥ | pratiṣṭhānādhipo vīro mṛgayārasikaḥ sadā || 64 || 	64. Formerly, in Kṛtayuga, there was a king named Indrasena. He was a great warrior ruling Pratiṣṭhāna. He was always interested in hunting. 
abrahmaṇyaḥ sadā krūraḥ kevalāsutṛpaḥ sadā | paraprāṇaurnijaprāṇānpuṣṇāti sa khalaḥ sadā || 65 || 	65. Unfriendly to brāhmaṇas, he always indulged in horrible and cruel misdeeds. He was always devoted to worldly pleasures only. That wicked king nourished his own self through the lives of others. 
parastrīlaṃ paṭo'tyaṃtaṃ paradravyeṣu lolupaḥ | brāhmaṇā ghātitāstena surāpaśca niraṃtaram || 66 || 	66. Ever-addicted to drinking wine, he very much sought the company of other men’s wives. He coveted other men’s wealth. Brāhmaṇas were killed by him. 
gurulatpagatotyarthaṃ sadā sauvarṇataskaraḥ | tathābhūtānugāḥ sarve rājñastasya durātmanaḥ || 67 || 	67. He defiled the bed of his preceptor. He always stole gold. All his followers too were of that nature. All the followers of that evil-minded king committed sins like him. 
evaṃ bahuvidhaṃ rājyaṃ cakāra sa durātmavān | tataḥ kālena mahatā paṃcatvaṃ prāpa durmatiḥ || 68 || 	68. Thus that vicious king ruled the kingdom in diverse ways. Then, after a great deal of time, the wicked king died. 
tadā yāmyaiśca nīto'sāviṃdraseno durātmavān | yamāntikamanuprāptastadā rājā sakalmaṣaḥ || 69 || 	69. Then, this evil-minded Indrasena was taken away by the followers of Yama. The sinful king thus came to the presence of Yama. 
yamena dṛṣṭastatrāsāviṃdrasenogrataḥ sthitaḥ | abhyutthānaparo bhūtvā nanāma śirasā śivam || 70 || 	70. Indrasena who was standing in front there, was seen by Yama. He stood up and bent his head (in honour of) Śiva. 
dūtānsaṃbhartsayāmāsa yamo dharmabhṛtāṃ varaḥ | pāśairbaddhaṃ caṃdrasenaṃ muktvā provāca dharmarāṭ || 71 || 	71. Yama, the most excellent one among those who uphold virtue, rebuked his messengers. After releasing Indrasena who had been bound with nooses Dharmarāja (god Yama) spoke: 
gaccha puṇyatamāṃllokānbhuṃkṣva rājanyasattama | yāvadiṃdraśca nāke'sti yāvatsūryo nabhastale || 72 || paṃcabhūtāni yāvacca tāvattvaṃ ca sukhī bhava | sukṛtī tvaṃ mahārāja śivabhakto'si nityadā || 73 || 	72-73. “O most excellent one among kings, go to the meritorious worlds and enjoy them as long as Indra stays in heaven, as long as the sun is in the sky. Be happy as long as the five elements exist. O great king, you are a man of meritorious deeds. You are a permanent devotee of Śiva.” 
yamasya vacanaṃ śrutvā iṃdrasenobhyabhāṣata | ahaṃ śivaṃ na jānāmi mṛgayārasiko hyaham || 74 || 	74. On hearing the words of Yama, Indrasena spoke: “I do not know Śiva. I am only a person interested in hunting.” 
tacchrutvā vacanaṃ tasya yamo bhāṣyamabhāṣata | āhara praharasveti uktaṃ cedaṃ sadā tvayā || 75 || tena karmavipākena sadā pūtosi mānada | tasmāttvaṃ gaccha kailāsaṃ parvataṃ śaṃkaraṃ prati || 76 || 	75-76. On hearing his words Yama spoke by way of explanation: “The words ‘āhara’ (eat), ‘praharasva’ (attack) were always uttered by you. As a result of that holy act, O bestower of honour, you are permanently purified. Hence you do go to the Kailāsa mountain, to Śaṅkara.” 
evaṃ saṃbhāṣamāṇasya yamasya ca mahātmanaḥ | āgatāḥ śivadvatāste vṛṣārūḍhā mahāprabhāḥ || 77 || nīlakaṃṭhā daśabhujāḥ paṃcavaktrāstrilocanāḥ | kaparddinaḥ kuṃḍalinaḥ śaśaṃkāṃkitamaulayaḥ || 78 || 	77-78. Even as the noble-minded Yama was talking thus, the messengers of Śiva came there riding on bulls. They had great refulgence. They were blue-throated, with ten arms, five faces and three eyes. They had matted hair and wore ear-rings. Their heads were markedly adorned with the crescent moon, 
tāndṛṣṭvā sahasotthāya yamo dharmabhṛtāṃ varaḥ | pūjayāmāsa tānsarvānmaheṃdrapratimāṃstadā || 79 || 	79. On seeing them, Yama, the most excellent one among the upholders of virtue, stood up. He worshipped them all who resembled the great Indra. 
tvarīrenaiva te sarve ūcurvaivasvataṃ yamam | atrāgato mahābhāga iṃdraseno'mitadyutiḥ | nāmnāḥ pravarttako nityaṃ rudrasya ca mahātmanaḥ || 80 || 	80. All of them hurriedly spoke to Yama, the son of Vivasvān: “O lord of exalted fortune, did Indrasena of unmeasured splendour come here? He is the person who continuously uttered the name of the noble-minded Rudra.” 
śrutvā ca vacanaṃ teṣāṃ yamena ca puraskṛtaḥ | iṃdraseno vimānasthaḥ preṣito hi śivālayam || 81 || 	81. On hearing their words, Indrasena was honoured by Yama and placed in an aerial chariot. He was then sent to the abode of Śiva. 
ānītoyaṃ tadā taiśca pārṣadapravarottamaiḥ | śaṃbhunā hi tadā dṛṣṭa iṃdraseno'mitadyutiḥ || 82 || 	82. He was brought in by the excellent attendants of Śiva. Then Indrasena of unmeasured splendour was seen by Śaṃbhu. 
abhyutthāyāgato rudraḥ pariṣvajya tadā nṛpam | arddhāsanagataṃ kṛtvā iṃdrasenaṃ tato'bravīt || 83 || 	83. Rudra stood up to welcome him, approached him and embraced the king. He made Indrasena sit on half of his seat and then said: 
kiṃ dātavyaṃ nṛpaśreṣṭha prayacchāmi tavepsitam | iti śrutvā vacastasya maheśasya tadā nṛpaḥ | ānaṃdāśrukaṇānmuṃcanpremṇā novāca kiṃcana || 84 || 	84. “O excellent king, what shall be given to you? What is your desire? I shall give you whatever is desired by you.” On hearing the words of the great Śiva the king shed tears of joy. (Overwhelmed) by love, he could not say anything. 
tadā kṛto maheśena pārṣado hi mahātmanā | caṃḍo nāmnāca vikhyātomuṇḍasya ca sakhā priyaḥ || 85 || 	85. Then he was made a Pārṣada (Attendant) by the noble-minded Maheśa. He became famous by the name Caṇḍa. He was a favourite friend of Muṇḍa. 
nāmoccāraṇamātreṇa rudrasya paramātmanaḥ | siddhiṃ prāpto hi pāpiṣṭha idraseno narādhipaḥ || 86 || 	86. Merely by uttering the name of Rudra, the supreme soul, (former) sinful king Indrasena attained Siddhi. 
rahehareti vai nāmnā śaṃbhoścakradharasya ca | rakṣitā bahavo martyāḥ śivena paramātmanā || 87 || 	87. By merely uttering ‘O Hari’, ‘O Hara’, the names of Śiva, the supreme soul, and of Viṣṇu, the wielder of discus, many men have been saved by Śiva. 
maheśānnāparo devo dṛśyatebhuvanatraye | tasmātsarvaprayatnena pūjanīyaḥ sadāśivaḥ || 88 || 	88. No other god greater than Maheśa (Śiva) can be seen (found) in the three worlds. Hence Sadāśiva should be worshipped by all the means. 
patraiḥpuṣpaiḥ phalairvāpi jalairvā vimalaiḥ sadā | karavīraiḥ pūjyamānaḥ śaṃkaro varado bhavet || 89 || 	89. He should always be worshipped with leaves, flowers, fruits, even pure water, and with Karavīra. And he becomes a bestower of boons. 
karavīrāddaśaguṇamarkapuṣpaṃ viśiṣyate | vibhūtyādikṛtaṃ sarvaṃ jagadetaccarācaram || 90 || 	90. The flower of Arka (calotropis gigantea) is ten times more efficacious than Karavīra. The entire universe consisting of mobile and immobile beings is made with Vibhūti (the sacred ash). 
śivasyāṃgaṇalagnā yā tasmāttāṃ dhārayetsadā | tatastripuṃḍre yatpumyaṃ tacchṛṇudhvaṃ dvijottamāḥ || 91 || 	91. It is always present in the courtyard of Śiva. Hence one should always besmear oneself with it. Henceforth, listen to the merit, O excellent brāhmaṇas, of Tripuṇḍra[6] (three parallel horizontal lines on the forehead) drawn with sacred ash. 
sarvapāpaharaṃ puṇyaṃ tacchṛṇudhvaṃ dvijottamāḥ | stenaḥ ko'pi mahāpāpo ghātito rājadūtakaiḥ || 92 || 	92. It is meritorious and it dispels all sins. Listen to it, O excellent brāhmaṇas. There was a certain thief who was a great sinner. He was executed by the servants of the king. 
taṃ khādituṃ samāyātaḥ śvāśirasyuparisthitaḥ | nakhāṃtarālasaṃlagnā rakṣā tasyaiva pāpinaḥ || 93 || lalāṭe patitā tasya tripuṃḍrāṃkiṃtamudrayā | caitanyena vinā tasya dehamātraikalagnayā || 94 || kailāsaṃ taskaro nīto rudradūtaistatastadā | vibhūtermahimānaṃ tu ko viśeṣiturmahati || 95 || 	93-95. A certain dog came there to eat him (his flesh) and stood over his head. Some ash sticking between the claws of the dog fell on the forehead of that sinner in the form of an impression similar to Tripuṇḍra. His body was without consciousness but the ash fell on it. Therefore the thief was taken to Kailāsa by the messengers of Rudra. Who can specifically describe the greatness of Vibhūti (holy ash). 
vibhūtvā maṃḍitāṃgānāṃ narāṇāṃ puṇyakarmaṇām | mukhe paṃcākṣaro yeṣāṃ rudrāste nātra śaṃśayaḥ || 96 || 	96. The men whose limbs are adorned with holy ash are men of meritorious deeds. The men in whose mouth the five-syllabled (Mantra), viz. namaḥ śivāya exists are undoubtedly veritable Rudras. 
jaṭākalāpino ye ca ye rudrākṣavibhūṣaṇāḥ | te vai manuṣyarūpeṇa rudrā nāstyatra saṃśayaḥ || 97 || 	97. Those who have a cluster of matted hair on their heads and those who have Rudrākṣa beads as their ornaments, are themselves Rudras in human form. There is no doubt about it. 
tasmātsadāśivaḥ puṃbhiḥ pūjanīyo hi nityaśaḥ | prātarmadhyāhnakāle ca sāyaṃ saṃdhyā viśiṣyate || 98 || 	98. Hence Sadāśiva should be regularly worshipped by men in the morning, at midday and in the evening. The time of dusk is very excellent. 
prātastu darśanācchaṃbhornaiśameno vyapohati | madhyāhne darśanācchaṃbhoḥ saptajanmārjitaṃ nṛṇām | pāpaṃ praṇāśamāyāti niśāyāṃ naiva gaṇyate || 99 || 	99. By seeing Śaṃbhu during the morning, the sin of (committed at) the night is dispelled. By visiting Śaṃbhu at midday the sin incurred by men in the course of seven previous births becomes quelled. (The merit of seeing Śaṃbhu) at night cannot be adequately calculated. 
śiveti dvyakṣaraṃ nāma mahā pāpapraṇāśanam | yeṣāṃ mukhodgataṃ nṝṇāṃ tairidaṃ dhāryate jagat || 100 || 	100. The two-syllabled name Śi-va is destructive of great sins. The whole universe is sustained by those men from whose mouths the name issues out. 
śivāṃgaṇe tu yā bherī sthāpitā puṇyakarmabhiḥ | tasyā nādena pūtā vai ye ca pāparatā janāḥ | pāṣaṃḍino'pyasadvādāste'pi yāṃti parāṃ gatim || 101 || 	101. Even heretics and those who cling to false and heterodox doctrines attain the greatest goal and people who are devoted to sinful activities become sanctified if they hear the sound of the Bherī (big drum) placed in the courtyard of Śiva’s temple by people of meritorious deeds. 
paśoryasya ca saṃbaddhā carmaṇā ca śivālaye | nṛbhiryā sthāpitā bherī mṛdaṃgamurajādi ca | sa paśuḥ śivasānnidhyamāpnotyatra na saṃśayaḥ || 102 || 	102. There is no doubt about this that even that animal attains Śiva’s presence, whose hide is used in connection with the Bherī, Mṛdaṅga, Muraja and other types of drums placed in Śiva’s temple by men. 
tasmāttataṃ ca vitataṃ ghanaṃ suṣirameva ca | cāmarāṇi mahārhāṇi maṃcakāḥ śayanāni ca || 103 || gāthāśca itihāsāśca gāyanaṃ ca yathāvidhi | bahurūpādikaṃ śaṃbhoḥ priyānyetāni kalpayet || 104 || kalpayitvā ca gacchaṃti śivalokaṃ hi pāpinaḥ | sudharmāṇo mahātmānaḥ śivapūjāviśāradāḥ || 105 || 	103-104. Hence the devotee should offer various things pleasing to Śaṃbhu in accordance with the injunctions, viz. Tata and Vitata (stringed musical instruments such as lute etc.), Ghana (cymbals, bells and gongs), Suṣira (flutes), very valuable chowries, palanquins, beds, (singing) story poems, legends, devotional music etc. 
gurormukhācca saṃprāptaśivapūjāratāśca ye | śivarūpeṇa ye viśvaṃ paśyaṃti kṛtaniścayāḥ || 106 || samyagbuddhyā samācārā varṇāśramayutā narāḥ | brāhmaṇāḥ kṣatriyā vaiśvayāḥ śūdrāścānye tathā narāḥ || 107 || śvapaco'pi variṣṭhaḥ sa śaṃbhoḥ priyataro bhavet | śaṃbhunādhiṣṭhitaṃ sarvaṃ jagadetaccarācaram || 108 || 	105-108. By offering these things even sinners go to the world of Śiva. (The following people get even better benefits:) Men of good holy rites, noble-souled men proficient in the worship of Śiva, those who are engaged in the worship of Śiva according to the procedure acquired directly from the (oral) instructions of the preceptor, those persons of firm resolve who see the universe as the form of Śiva, persons of good conduct with perfect intellect, men who adhere to the discipline of castes and stages of life as well as others, brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras and other men. Even a cāṇḍāla (devotee of Śiva) is excellent. He shall be a great favourite of Śaṃbhu. The whole of this universe including mobile and immobile beings is presided over by Śaṃbhu. 
tasmātsarvaṃ śivamayaṃ jñātavyaṃ suviśeṣataḥ | vedaiḥ purāṇaiḥ śāstraiśca tathaupanipadairapi || 109 || āgamairvividhaiḥ śaṃbhurjñātavyo nātra saṃśayaḥ | niṣkāmaiśca sakāmaiśca pūjanīyaḥ sadā śivaḥ || 110 || 	109-110. Hence it should be especially understood that everything is identical with Śiva. Śaṃbhu should be known by means of Vedas, Purāṇas, sacred treatises, Upaniṣads and different kinds of Āgamas. Sadāśiva should be worshipped by all people irrespective of their being with or without desires. 
lomaśa uvāca | kathayāmi purāvṛttamitihāsaṃ purātanam | naṃdī nāma purā vaiśyo hyavaṃtīpuramāvasat || 111 || 	Lomaśa said: 111. I shall narrate an old legend describing an event that happened long ago. Formerly there was a vaiśya named Nandin who lived in the city of Avantī.[7] 
śivadhyānaparo bhūtvā śivapūjāṃ cakāra saḥ | nityaṃ tapovanasthaṃ hi liṃgamekaṃ samarcayat || 112 || 	112. He engaged himself in meditation on Śiva and performed his worship. Everyday he worshipped a Liṅga that was in the penance grove. 
uṣasyuṣasi cotthāya pratyahaṃ śivavallabhaḥ | naṃdīliṃgārccanarato babhūvātiśayena hi || 113 || 	113. He used to get up very early in the morning everyday. Nandī, the lover of Śiva, became excessively devoted to the worship of the Liṅga. 
liṃgaṃ paṃcāmṛtenaiva yathoktenābhyaṣecayat | vipraiḥ samāvṛto nityaṃ vedavedāṃgapāragaiḥ || 114 || 	114. He bathed the Liṅga in Pañcāmṛta in the manner prescribed (in scriptures). He was always surrounded by brāhmaṇas who had mastered Vedas and Vedāṅgas (ancillaries to Vedas). 
yathāśāstreṇa vidhinā liṃgārcanaparo'bhavat | snāpayitvā tataḥ puṣpairnānaścaryasamanvitaiḥ || 115 || muktāphalairiṃdranīlairgomedaiśca niraṃtaram | vaiḍūryaiścaiva nīlaiśca māṇikyaiśca tathārcayat || 116 || 	115-116. He was devoted to the worship of the Liṅga in accordance with the injunctions of the sacred treatises. After bathing the Liṅga duly, he always worshipped it with different kinds of wonderful flowers, pearls, aspphires, Gomedas (Himalayan gems), lapis lazuli, emeralds and rubies. 
evaṃ naṃdī mahābhāgo bahūnyabdāni cārccayat | vijanasthaṃ tadā liṃgaṃ nānābhogasamanvitam || 117 || 	117. Thus Nandī of exalted fortune worshipped for many years that Liṅga stationed in a lonely spot with different kinds of offerings. 
ekadā mṛgayāsaktaḥ kirāto bhūtahiṃsakaḥ | avivekaparo bhūtvā mṛgayārasikaḥ sadā || 118 || 	118. Once there was a Kirāta (a forester) who was interested in hunting and used to injure and kill animals. Being wreckless he always enjoyed hunting. 
pāpī pāpasamācāro vicarangirikaṃdare | anekaśvāpadākīrṇe hanyamāna itastataḥ || 119 || 	119. That wicked fellow of sinful activities used to wander in mountains and caves teeming with beasts of prey, killing the animals here and there. 
evaṃ vicaramāṇo'sau kirāto bhūtahiṃsakaḥ | yadṛcchayāgatastatra yatra liṃgaṃ supūjitam || 120 || 	120. In the course of his wandering that Kirāta, a habitual killer of animals, came by chance where the Liṅga had been duly worshipped. 
udakaṃ vīkṣmāṇo'sau tṛṣayā pīḍito bhṛśam | tato vane saraḥ śīghraṃ dṛṣṭvā toye samāviśat || 121 || 	121. He was extremely afflicted with thirst and looked for water (everywhere). He saw a lake in the forest and immediately entered the water. 
tīre saṃsthāpya duṣṭātmā tatsarvaṃ mṛgayādikam | gaṃḍūṣotsarjanaṃ kṛtvā pītvā toyaṃ ca nirgataḥ || 122 || 	122. The wicked fellow had placed everything he had got by hunting, on the shore. He gargled, drank some water and came out. 
śivālayaṃ dadarśāgre anekāścaryamaṃḍitam | dṛṣṭaṃ supūjitaṃ liṃgaṃ nānāratnaiḥ pṛthakpṛthak || 123 || tathā liṃgaṃ samālakṣya yadā pūjāṃ samāharat | ratnāni sarvabhūtāni vidhūtāni itastataḥ || 124 || snapanaṃ tasya liṃgasya kṛtaṃ gaṃḍūṣavārīṇā | kareṇaikena pūjārthaṃ bilvapatrāṇi so'rpayat || 125 || 	123-126. He saw in front of him the temple that had been wonderfully embellished. The Liṅga that had been excellently worshipped by means of different kinds of gems was seen (by him). After seeing the Liṅga, when he began to offer his worship, all the gems were tossed about here and there. Bathing of the Liṅga was performed by him by means of a mouthful of water. With one of his hands he offered Bilva leaves (Aegle marmelos) for the purpose of worship. With the other hand he offered venison. After prostrating himself like a stick he mentally took the solemn vow to perform worship (as follows): 
adyaprabhṛti pūjāṃ vai kariṣyāmi prayatnataḥ | tvaṃ me svāmī ca bhaktohamadyaprabhṛti śaṃkara || 127 || 	127. “From today onwards I shall strenuously perform the worship. From today, O Śaṅkara, you are my master and I am your devotee.” 
evaṃ naiyamiko bhūtvā kirāto gṛhamāgataḥ | nandī dadarśa tatsarvaṃ kirātena itastataḥ || 128 || 	128. After having thus become a regular worshipper, the Kirāta returned home. Nandī saw everything scattered here and there by the Kirāta. 
ciṃtāyukto'bhavannaṃdī jātaṃ kiṃ chidramadya me | kathitāni ca vighnāni śivapūjāratasya ca | upasthitāni tānyeva mama bhāgyaviparyayāt || 129 || 	129. Nandī became anxious and worried: ‘What flaw is this that has befallen me? Many obstacles have been mentioned in the case of one who is engaged in the worship of Śiva. Owing to my misfortune all those obstacles have beset me.’ 
evaṃ vimṛśya suciraṃ prakṣālya śivamaṃdiram | yathāgatena mārgeṇa naṃdī svagṛhamāgataḥ || 130 || 	130. After pondering thus for a long time, he washed the temple of Śiva. Nandī then returned to his house along the path by which he had gone. 
tato naṃdinamāgatya purodhā gatamānasam | abravodvacanaṃ taṃ tu kasmāttvaṃ gatamānasaḥ || 131 || 	131. The priest approached Nandī (as he was found) dejected in his mind. He spoke these words: “Why have you become dejected in your mind?” 
purohitaṃ prati tadā nandī vacanamabravīt || 132 || adya dṛṣṭaṃ mayā vipra amedhyaṃ śivasaṃnidhau | kenedaṃ kāritaṃ tatra na jānāmi kathaṃcana || 133 || 	132-133. Nandī then spoke these words to his priest: “O brāhmaṇa, impure things have been seen by me today in the vicinity of Śiva. I do not know at all by whom this has been caused.” 
tataḥ purodhā vacanaṃ nandinaṃ cābravīttadā | yena viskhalitaṃ tatra ratnādīnāṃ prapūjanam | so'pi mūḍho na saṃdehaḥ kāryākāryeṣu maṃdadhīḥ || 134 || tasmācciṃtā na kartavyā tvayā amurapi prabho | prabhāte ca mayā sārddhaṃ gamyatāṃ tacchivālayam || 135 || nirīkṣaṇārthaṃ duṣṭasya tatkāryaṃ vidadhāmyaham | etacchrutvā tu vacanaṃ nandī tasya purodhasaḥ || 136 || 	134-140. Then the priest spoke these words to Nandin: “The person by whom the offerings of gems etc. have been scattered is a deluded one. There is no doubt. He is a stupid fellow not aware of what should be or should not be done. Hence, O lord, do not worry in the least. Be pleased to go to that temple of Śiva in the morning along with me in order to see that wicked fellow. Thereafter, I shall do what should be done.” On hearing these words of his priest, Nanḍin remained in his house during the night with his mind extremely pained. 
āsthitaḥ svagṛhe naktaṃ dūyamānena cetasā | tasyāṃ rātryāṃ vyatītāyāmāhūya ca purodhasam || 137 || gataḥ śivālayaṃ nandī samaṃ tena mahātmanā | tato dṛṣṭaṃ pūrvadine kṛtaṃtena durātmanā || 138 || samyakprapūjanaṃ kṛtvā nānāratnaparicchadam | pañcopacārasaṃyuktaṃ caikādasyanvitaṃ tathā || 139 || 	When the night passed, he called the priest and went to the temple of Śiva. Nandī went there along with that noble-souled one. Thereafter, what was done by that wicked one the previous day was seen. 
anekastutibhiḥ stutvā girīśaṃ brāhmaṇaiḥ saha | tadā yāmadvayaṃ jātaṃ stūyamānasya naṃdinaḥ || 140 || 	Nandī performed the worship elaborately with different kinds of gems for the requisite things. The five ‘Upacāras (modes of service in the course of the worship) and recitation of Rudra hymns eleven times while bathing the god were duly performed. He eulogized Giriśa with various hymns and prayers in the company of brāhmaṇas. Two Yāmas (i.e. six hours) were thus spent by Nandī engaged in eulogy. 
āyāto hi mahākālasthārūpo mahābalaḥ | kālarūpo mahāraudro dhanuṣpāṇiḥ pratāpavān || 141 || 	141. Indeed, at that time, there arrived (the Kirāta called) Mahākāla who was of the same form (as before). He was extremely powerful, very hideous and dreadful like the god of Death. He was valorous and armed with a bow in his hand. 
taṃ dṛṣṭvā bhayavitrasto nandī sa vilalāpa ha | purodhāścaiva sahasā bhayabhītastadābhavat || 142 || 	142. On seeing him Nandī was excessively frightened and he cried. The priest too was suddenly struck with fear. 
kirātena kṛtaṃ tatra yathāpūrvamaviskhalam | tāṃ pūjāṃ prapadāhatya bilvapatraṃ samarpayat || 143 || 	143. Everything was done by the Kirāta scrupulously as before. With the forepart of his foot he kicked aside the (previous) worship by Nandī and offered leaves of Bilva (instead). 
snapanaṃ tasya kṛtvā ca tato gaṃḍūṣavāriṇā | naivedyaṃ tatpalaṃ caiva kirātaḥ śivamarpayat || 144 || 	144. The bathing rite was performed by means of the mouthful of water. The Naivedya (food offering) was the piece of flesh. Thus the Kirāta offered everything to Śiva. 
daṇḍavatpatito bhūmāvutthāya svagṛhaṃ gataḥ | taddṛṣṭvā mahadāścaryaṃ ciṃtayāmāsa vai ciram || 145 || purodhasā saha tadā naṃdīvyākulacetasā | tena cākāritā viprā bahavo vedavādinaḥ || 146 || nivedya teṣu tatsarvaṃ kirātena ca yatkṛtam | kiṃ kāryamatha bho viprāḥ kathyatāṃ ca yathātatham || 147 || 	145-147. He prostrated himself on the ground like a staff of wood. Then he rose up and went to his abode. On seeing that extremely wonderful incident, he (Nandī) thought about it for a long time. Along with the priest, Nandī was agitated in his mind as he pondered over this. Many brāhmaṇas, expounders of the Vedas, were invited by him. He recounted to them everything performed by the Kirāta and asked them: “What should be done, O brāhmaṇas? Let everything be explained accurately.” 
saṃpradhārya tataḥ sarve militvā dharmaśāstrataḥ | ūcuḥ sarve tadā viprā naṃdinaṃ cātiśaṃkinam || 148 || 	148. All of them met together and ascertained the matter from the point of Dharma Śāstra. Then, all those brāhmaṇas spoke to Nandin who was extremely frightened and suspicious: 
idaṃ vighnaṃ samutpannaṃ durnivāryaṃ surairapi | tasmādānaya liṃgaṃ tvaṃ svagṛhaṃ vaiśyasatt || 149 || 	149. “This obstacle that has sprung up cannot be warded off even by Devas. Hence, O excellent vaiśya, bring that Liṅga to your own abode.” 
tatheti matvāsau naṃdī śivasyotpāṭanaṃ tadā | kṛtvā svagṛha mānīya pratiṣṭhāpya yatāvidhi || 150 || suvarṇapīṭhikāṃ kṛtvā navaratnasuśobhitām | upacārairanekaiśca pūjayāmāsa vai tadā || 151 || 	150-151. He honoured their suggestion saying, “So be it”. Then Nandī dug out that Śivaliṅga, brought it to his own house and consecrated it duly after placing it on a golden pedestal rendered splendid by means of the nine precious stones. He then performed the Pūjā with various kinds of rites and articles of worship. 
athāpare dyurāyātaḥ kitarātaḥ śivamaṃdiram | yāvadvilokyāmāsa liṃgamaiśaṃ na dṛṣṭavān || 152 || 	152. The next day the Kirāta came to the temple of Śiva and on glancing about could not see the Liṅga of Īśa. 
maunaṃ vihāya sahasā hyākrośannidamabravīt | he śaṃbho kva gatosi tvaṃ darśayātmānamadya vai || 153 || na dṛṣṭosi mayā tvaṃ hi tyajāmyadya kalevaram | he śaṃbho he jagannātha tripurāṃtakara prabho || 154 || he rudra he mahādevadarśayātmānamātmanā || 155 || 	153-157. Breaking his silence suddenly he shouted loudly and spoke thus: “O Śaṃbhu, where have you gone? Reveal yourself to me now. If you are not seen now, I will give up my body. O Śaṃbhu, O lord of the universe, O destroyer of Tripura, O Rudra, O Mahādeva, reveal your form yourself.” 
evaṃ sākṣepamadhurairvākyaiḥ kṣiptaḥ sadāśivaḥ | kirātena tato raṃgairvīrosau jaṭharaṃ svakam || 156 || vibhedāśu tato bāhūnāsphoṭyaiva ruṣābravīt | he śaṃbho darśayātmānaṃ kuto māṃ tyajya yāsyasi || 157 || 	Thus, by means of sweet words of apparent rebuke Sadāśiva was disrespected by the Kirāta. Then that heroic forester tore up his belly with his nails. Stroking his arms he said angrily, “O Śaṃbhu, reveal yourself. Where will you go abandoning me?” 
iti kṣitvā tatoṃtrāṇi māṃsamukṛttya sarvataḥ | tasmingarte kareṇaiva kirātaḥ sahasākṣipat || 158 || 	158. After scolding thus, the Kirāta cut the flesh all round and took out the intestines. With his hand he threw them suddenly into that pit. 
svasthaṃ ca hṛdayaṃ kṛtvā sasnau tatsarasi dhruvam | tathaiva jalamānīya bilvapattraṃ tvarānvitaḥ || 159 || pūjayitvā yathānyāyaṃ daṃḍavatpatito bhuvi || 160 || dhyānasthitastatastatra kirātaḥ śivasaṃnidhau | prādurbhūtastadā rudraḥ pramathaiḥ parivāritaḥ || 161 || 	159-161. He steadied his heart and took bath in that lake. Similarly he brought water and Bilva leaves hurriedly. He worshipped the lord duly and prostrated on the ground stretching himself like a stick of wood. Thereafter the Kirāta remained there in the presence of Śiva engaged in meditation. Thereupon, Rudra surrounded by Pramathas, revealed himself to him. 
karpūragaurodyutimānkapardī caṃdraśekharaḥ | taṃ gṛhītvā kare rudra uvāca parisāṃtvayan || 162 || 	162. The moon-crested lord Rudra who was white like camphor and who was refulgent with matted hair, grasped him by the hand and assuaged him consolingly. 
bhobho vīra mahāprājña madbhaktosi mahāmate | varaṃ vṛṇīṣvātmahitaṃ yatte'bhilaṣitaṃ mahat || 163 || 	163. “O heroic one of great intellect, you are my devotee. Choose a boon conducive to your own welfare. O highly intelligent one, (speak) whatever is intensely desired by you.” 
evamuktaḥ sa rudreṇa mahākālo mudānvitaḥ | papāta daṃḍavadbhūmau bhaktyā paramayā yutaḥ || 164 || 	164. On being addressed thus by Rudra, Mahākāla became joyous. Endowed with great devotion, he fell down on the ground like a stick of wood. 
tato rudraṃ babhāpe sa varaṃ samprārthayāmyaham | ahaṃ dāsosmi te rudra tvaṃ me svāmī na saṃśayaḥ || 165 || etadbuddhātmano bhaktiṃ dehi janmanijanmani | tvaṃ mātā ca pitā tvaṃ ca tvaṃ baṃdhuśca sakhā hi me || 166 || tvaṃ guhustvaṃ mahāmaṃtro maṃtravedyo'si sarvadā | tasmāttvadaparaṃ nānyattriṣu lokeṣu kiṃcana || 167 || 	165-167. Then he spoke to Rudra: “I request for the boon. O Rudra, there is no doubt about (the fact) that I am your slave. You are my lord and master. Realizing this, grant me devotion unto you in every birth. You are my mother. You are my father too. You are my kinsman and friend. You are the preceptor. You are the great Mantra. You are always worthy of being known through the Mantras. Hence in the three worlds there is nothing else than you.” 
niṣkāmaṃ vākyamākarṇya kirātasya tadā bhavaḥ | dadau pārṣadamukhyatvaṃ dvārapālatvameva ca || 168 || 	168. On hearing these words of the Kirāta, devoid of desire, Śiva granted him the position of the chief of his attendants and the post of his doorkeeper. 
tadā ḍamarunādena nāditaṃ bhuvanatrayam | bherībhāṃkāraśabdena śaṃkhānāṃ ninadena ca || 169 || tadā duṃdubayo neduḥ paṭahāścasahasraśaḥ | naṃdī taṃ nādamākarṇya vismayāttavarīto yayau || 170 || tapovanaṃ yatra śivaḥ sthitaḥ pramathasaṃvṛtaḥ | kirāto hi tathā dṛṣṭo naṃdinā ca tadā bhṛśam || 171 || 	"169-173. Then the three worlds were filled with the sound of Ḍamaru (a kind of drum), with the booming sound of the big drum Bherī and the sound of conchs. Then thousands of Dundubhis and Paṭahas (different kinds of drums) were sounded. On hearing that sound ""Nandi was surprised. He hurried to the place in the penance grove where Śiva was present surrounded by Pramathas. The Kirāta too was seen exactly like that by Nandi. Nandi who was surprised much, spoke these words humbly. He became desirous of eulogizing the Kirāta with great intentness: “Śaṃbhu was brought here by you. O scorcher of enemies, you are (his real) devotee. I am your devotee and have come here. Mention about me to Śaṅkara.” "
tacchrutvā vacanaṃ tasya kirātastvarayānvitaḥ | naṃdinaṃ ca kare gṛhya śaṃkaraṃ samupāgataḥ || 174 || 	174. On hearing his words, the Kirāta grasped Nandī by the hand and hurriedly approached Śaṅkara. 
prahasya bhagavānrudraḥ kirātaṃ vākyamabravīt | ko'yaṃ tvayā samānīto gaṇānāmiha sannidhau || 175 || 	175. Lord Rudra laughingly spoke these words to the Kirāta: “Who is this person brought by you in the presence of the Gaṇas?” 
kirāta uvāca | vijñapto'sau kirātena śaṃkaro lokaśaṃkaraḥ | tava bhaktaḥ sadā deva tava pūjārato hyasau || 176 || 	176. Śaṅkara, the benefactor of all the worlds, was then informed by the Kirāta: Kirāta said: This is your devotee, O lord. He is always engaged in your worship. 
pratyahaṃ ratnamāṇikyaiḥ puṣpaiścoccāvacairapi | jīvitena dhanenāpi pūjito'si na saṃśayaḥ || 177 || tasmājjānīhi manmitraṃ naṃdinaṃ bhaktavatsala || 178 || 	177-178. Everyday you have been worshipped by him with gems and rubies, flowers of various kinds, with his own life as well as wealth. There is no doubt about this. Hence know that he is my friend, Nandin, O lord favourably disposed towards your devotees. 
mahādeva uvāca | na jānāmi mahābhāga naṃdinaṃ vaiśyacarcitam | tvaṃ me bhaktaḥ sakhā ceti mahākāla mahāmate || 179 || 	Mahādeva said: 179. I do not know, O highly fortunate one, Nandī, the vaiśya mentioned (by you), (but) O Mahākāla of great intellect, (I shall accept him) because you are my devotee as well as friend. 
upādhirahitā ca ye'pi caiva manasvinaḥ | te'tīva me priyā bhaktāste viśiṣṭā narottamāḥ || 180 || 	180. Those who are free from fraud, and are of lofty mind, are dear devotees of mine. They are excellent men. 
tava bhakto hyahaṃ tāta sa ca me priyakṛttaraḥ | tāvubhau svīkṛtau tena pārṣadatvena śaṃbhunā || 181 || 	181. He is your devotee and hence he is a dearer friend tome. Thus both of them were accepted by Śaṃbhu as his attendants. 
tato vimānāni bahūni tatra samāgatānyeva mahāprabhāṇi | kirātavaryeṇa sa vaiśyavarya uddhāritastena mahāprabheṇa || 182 || 	182. Then many aerial chariots of great lustre arrived there. That excellent vaiśya was redeemed by that excellent Kirāta of great refulgence. 
kailāsaṃ parvataṃ prāptau vimānairvegavattaraiḥ | sārūpyameva saṃprāptāvīśvareṇa mahātmanā || 183 || 	183. By means of aerial chariots of great speed both of them arrived at Mount Kailāsa. They attained the state of having the same form as that of the noble-souled Īśvara. 
nīrājitau girijayā śivena sahitau tadā | uvācedaṃ tato devī prahasya gajagāminī || 184 || 	184. Waving of the light was performed by Girijā to both of them along with Śiva. Thereupon, the goddess with a graceful gait of an elephant laughingly said to Śiva: 
yathā tvaṃ hi mahādeva tathā caitau na saṃśayaḥ | svarūpeṇa ca gatyā ca hāsyabhāvaiḥ supūjitau || 185 || 	185-188. “Just as you are, so also are these, undoubtedly in form as well as mode of walking. They are well-honoured with smiles and friendliness. Hitherto you alone had been served by me, no doubt.” 
mayā tvameka evāsīḥ sevito vai na saṃśayaḥ | devyāstadvacanaṃ śrutvā kirāto vaiśya eva ca || 186 || sadyaḥ parāṅmukhau bhūtvā śaṃkarasya ca paśyataḥ | bhavāvastvanukaṃpyau ca bhavatā hi trilocana || 187 || tava dvāri sthitau nityaṃ bhāvavaste namonamaḥ || 188 || 	On hearing the words of the goddess, the Kirāta and the vaiśya turned their faces aside immediately even as Śaṅkara was observing. (They said:) “We are to be sympathized by you alone, O three-eyed lord. We shall perpetually stand at your door. Obeisance, obeisance to you.” 
tayorbhāvaṃ sa bhagavānviditvā prahasanbhavaḥ | uvāca parayā bhaktyā bhavatorastu vāṃchitam || 189 || tadā prabhṛti tāvetau dvārapālau babhūvatuḥ | śivadvāri sthitau viprā madhyāhne śivadarśinau || 190 || 	189. Knowing their intention, Bhava laughingly said: “On account of your great devotion may your desire be fulfilled.” 190. Ever since then both of them became the gatekeepers. They stood at the doorway of Śiva, O brāhmaṇas. They had the vision of Śiva during midday. 
eko naṃdī mahākālo dvāvetau śivavallabhau | ūcatustau mudāyuktāveka eva sadāśivaḥ || 191 || 	191. One was Nandi and the other Mahākāla. Both of them were lovers of Śiva. Both of them joyously talked to Saḍāśiva who was one. 
ekāṃguliṃ samuddhṛtya mahādevobhyabhāṣata | tathā naṃdī uvācedamuddhṛtya svāṃgulidvayam || 192 || evaṃ saṃjñānvitau dvāri tiṣṭhatastau mahātmanaḥ | śaṃkarasya mahābhāgāḥ śrṛṇvaṃtu ṛṣayo hyamī || 193 || 	192-193. Mahādeva talked to them lifting up one of his fingers. Similarly Nandi said lifting up two of his fingers. Thus with the gestures and signs they stand at the entrance to the abode of the noble-souled (lord) Śaṅkara. O highly fortunate sages, listen. 
śailādena purā proktaṃ śivadharmamanaṃtakam | prāṇināṃ kṛpayā viprāḥ sarveṣāṃ duṣkṛtātmanām || 194 || 	194-197. Formerly the unlimited pious rites of Śiva had been proclaimed by Śailāda out of sympathy, O brāhmaṇas, for evil-minded living beings, sinners, impious people, blind ones, dumb beings, lame ones, those of ignoble births, evil-minded ones, cāṇḍālas, and other persons whatever their nature may be. If they are endowed with devotion to Śiva, they go to the presence of the trident-bearing lord of Devas. Those learned men who worship a Liṅga made of sand, go to Rudraloka undoubtedly.

ṛṣaya ūcuḥ | liṃge pratiṣṭhā ca kathaṃ śivaṃ hitvā pravartitā | tatkathyatāṃ mahābhāga paraṃ śuśruṣatāṃ hi naḥ || 1 || 	The sages enquired: 1. How did the pre-eminence of Liṅga, exclusive of Śiva, come to be established? O highly fortunate sage, let this be narrated to us who are eagerly desirous of learning it. Lomaśa said: 
lomaśa uvāca | yadā dāruvane śaṃbhurbhikṣārthaṃ prācaratprabhuḥ || 2 || digaṃbaro muktajaṭākalāpo vedāṃtavedyo bhuvanaikabhartā | sa īśvaro brahmakalāpadhāro yogīśvarāṇāṃ paramaḥ paraśca || 3 || aṇoraṇīyānmahato mahī yānmahānubhāvo bhuvanādhipo mahān | sa īśvaro bhikṣurūpī mahātmā bhikṣāṭanaṃ dāruvane cakāra || 4 || 	2-4. Lord Śaṃbhu wandered about in the forest Dāruvana for the sake of begging alms.[1] The sole lord of the worlds with quarters for his garments (i.e. naked), having the cluster of his matted hair loosened, that lord who can be understood only through Vedānta (i.e. Upaniṣads), the great lord, the greatest among leading Yogins, the sole supporter of the group of worlds is greater than the greatest. He is the great lord of the worlds with exalted dignity. That noble-souled Īśvara assumed the form of a mendicant; begged for alms in the Dāruvana forest. 
madhyāhna ṛṣayo viprāstīrthaṃ jagmuḥ svakāśramāt | tadānīmeva sarvāstā ṛṣībhāryāḥ samāgatāḥ || 5 || 	5. At midday the sages, O brāhmaṇas, went to the sacred places (for bath) from their hermitages. At that very time, all the wives of those sages came there. 
vilokayaṃtyaḥ śaṃbhuṃ tamācakhyuśca parasparam | ko'sau bhikṣukarūpoyamāgato'pūrvadarśanaḥ || 6 || asmai bhikṣāṃ prayacchāmo vayaṃ ca sakhibhiḥ saha | tatheti gatvā sarvāstā gṛhebhya ānayanmudā || 7 || bhikṣānnaṃ vividhaṃ ślakṣṇaṃ sopacāraṃ ca śaktitaḥ | pradattaṃ bhikṣitaṃ tena devadevena śūlinā || 8 || 	6-8. On seeing Śaṃbhu they spoke to one another, “Who is this personage of uncommon appearance, who has come here in the form of a mendicant? We along with our friends shall give him alms.” Saying, “So be it”, they went home and joyously brought various kinds of food as alms. They were fine and delicate. They offered everything in accordance with their capacity but with due honour and gentle behaviour. The alms begged for by the Trident-bearing Lord of Devas were (duly given to him). 
kācitpriyatamaṃ śaṃbhuṃ babhāṣe vismayānvitā | kosi tvaṃ bhikṣuko bhūtvā āgatotra mahāmate || 9 || ṛṣīṇāmāśramaṃ śuddhaṃ kimarthaṃ no niṣīdasi | tayokto'pi tadā śaṃbhurbabhāṣe prahasanniva || 10 || 	9-12. One of the ladies who was struck with wonder asked Śaṃbhu who endeared himself very much to her: “Who are you, O excessively intelligent one? Why have you come here as a mendicant? This is the sacred hermitage of sages. Why do you not sit here in our hermitage?” On being asked thus by her, Śaṃbhu said laughingly: 
īśvarohaṃ sukeśāṃte pāvanaṃ prāptavānimam | īśvarasya vacaḥ śrutvā ṛṣibhāryā uvāca tam || 11 || 	“I am Īśvara, O lady with excellent tresses; I have come to this holy place.” On hearing the words of Īśvara (Śiva) the wife of the sage asked him: 
īśvaro'si mahābhāga kailāsapatireva ca | ekākinaḥ kathaṃ deva bhikṣārthamaṭanaṃ tava || 12 || 	“(You say that) you are Īśvara (Śiva), O gentle Sir, of exalted fortune. You are the lord of the Kailāsa mountain. But, O lord, how does it happen that you are begging for alms alone and single?” 
evamuktastayā śaṃbhuḥ punastāmabravīdvacaḥ | dākṣāyaṇyā virahito vicarāmi digaṃbaraḥ || 13 || bhikṣāṭanārthaṃ suśroṇi saṃkalparahitaḥ sadā | tayā satyā vinā kiṃcitstrīmātraṃ mama bhāmini | na rocate viśālākṣi satyaṃ prativadāmi te || 14 || 	13-14. On being asked thus by her, Śaṃbhu said to her once again these words: “I am bereaved of Dākṣāyaṇī. Hence I wander about nude for the purpose of begging alms, O lady of excellent hips. I am free from any wish or desire or any expectation of advantage from anybody. O beautiful lady, without Satī all the women in the world do not at all appeal to me. I am speaking the truth to you, O lady of large eyes.” 
tasyoktaṃ vacanaṃ śrutvā uvāca kamalekṣaṇā | striyo hi sukhasaṃsparśāḥ puruṣasya na saṃśayaḥ || 15 || tāsstriyo varjitāḥ śaṃbho tvādṛśena vipaścitā || 16 || 	15-16. On hearing the words spoken by him, the lotus-eyed lady said: “There is no doubt that women really accord pleasure by their touch unto man. Such pleasurable women, O Śaṃbhu, have been eschewed by a learned man like you!” 
iti ca pramadāḥ sarvā militā yatra śaṃkaraḥ | bhikṣāpātraṃ ca tacchaṃbhoḥ pūritaṃ ca mahāguṇaiḥ || 17 || 	17-21. In this manner all young women gathered together at the place where Śaṅkara was (standing). The alms-bowl of Śaṃbhu was filled with cooked food of very good quality. Four types of foodstuffs with all the six tastes filled his bowl. 
annaiścaturvidhaiḥ ṣaḍbhī rasaiśca paripūritam | yadā saṃbhurgaṃtukāmaḥ kailāsaṃ parvataṃ prati | tadā sarvā viprapatnyo hyangacchanmudānvitāḥ || 18 || gṛhakāryaṃ parityajya cerustadgatamānasāḥ | gatāsu tāsu sarvāsu patnīṣu ṛṣisattamāḥ || 19 || 	When Śaṃbhu was desirous of returning to the Kailāsa mountain, all those wives of brāhmaṇas joyously followed him forsaking their domestic duties. With their minds attached to him, they walked on and on (after him). 
yāvadāśramamabhyetya tāvacchūnyaṃ vyalokayan | parasparamathocuste patnyaḥ sarvāḥ kuto gatāḥ || 20 || na vidāmo'tha vai sarvāḥ kena naṣṭena cāhṛtāḥ | evaṃ vimṛśyamānāste vicinvaṃtastatastataḥ || 21 || 	When all those wives (of sages) had left thus, the excellent sages reached their hermitages and found them empty and vacant. They spoke to one another, “Where have all these women (our wives) gone? We do not know by what damned fellow they have been abducted.” Pondering and deliberating thus they searched here and there. 
samapaśyaṃstataḥ sarve śivasyānugatāśca tāḥ | śivaṃ dṛṣṭvā tu saṃprāptā ṛṣayaste ruṣānvitāḥ || 22 || 	22. Thereupon they saw that they had been following Śiva. On seeing Śiva, the sages angrily closed in upon him. 
śivasyāthāgrato bhūtvā ūcuḥ sarve tvarānvitāḥ | kiṃ kṛtaṃ hi tvayā śaṃbho viraktena mahātmanā | paradārāpaharttāsi tvamṛṣīṇāṃ na saṃśayaḥ || 23 || 	23. Standing in front of Śiva, all of them said with impetuosity, “What has been done by you, O Śaṃbhu (who profess to be) detached and noble-souled? You are no doubt the kidnapper of the wives of others, i.e. of us, the sages.” 
evaṃ kṣiptaḥ śivo maunī gacchamāno'pi parvatam | tadā sa ṛṣibhiḥ prāpto mahādevo'vyayastathā | yasmātkalatrahartā tvaṃ tasmātṣaṃḍho bhava tvaram || 24 || 	24. Although rebuked thus, Śiva silently went on towards his mountain. Then that immutable Mahādeva was overtaken by the sages. (They then cursed him thus:) “Since you are the abductor of (our) wives, be instantaneously a eunuch.” 
evaṃ śaptaḥ sa munibhirliṃgaṃ tasyāpatadbhuvi | bhūmiprāptaṃ ca talliṃgaṃ vavṛdhe tarasā mahat || 25 || 	25. Thus cursed by the sages, his penis fell down on the ground. As soon as it reached the ground, it became very large immediately and it increased in size (enormously). 
āvṛtya sapta pātālānkṣaṇālliṃgamadordhvataḥ | vyāpya pṛthvīṃ samagrāṃ ca aṃtarikṣaṃ samāvṛṇot || 26 || svargāḥ samāvṛtāḥ sarve svargātītamathābhavat | na mahī na ca dikcakraṃ na toyaṃ na ca pāvakaḥ || 27 || na ca vāyurna vākāśaṃ nāhaṃkāro na vā mahat | na cāvyaktaṃ na kālaśca na mahāprakṛtistathā || 28 || 	26-31. From beneath and above, the Liṅga covered the seven Pātālas in an instant. Then it pervaded the entire earth and enveloped the firmament. All the heavens were covered. Then it rose beyond the heavens. There was no earth, no quarters, neither water nor fire, neither wind nor ether, neither Cosmic Ego (Ahaṃkāra) nor the Great Principle (Mahat), neither the Unmanifest One (Avyakta) nor the Time and no great Primordial Matter (Prakṛti). There was no dualistic division. Everything became merged in an instant. Since the entire universe became Lina (merged) in that Liṅga of the great Ātman (it came to be called so). 
layanālliṃgamityevaṃ pravadaṃti manīṣiṇaḥ | tathābhūtaṃ varddhamānaṃ dṛṣṭvā te'pi surarṣayaḥ || 30 || brahmeṃdraviṣṇuvāyyagnilokapālāḥ sapannagāḥ | vismayāviṣṭamanasaḥ parasparamathābruvan || 31 || 	Learned men say that it is called Liṅga because of Layana (merging of the universe). On seeing such a Liṅga rising further and further, the celestial sages, Brahmā, Indra, Viṣṇu, Vāyu, Agni and the Guardians of the Quarters and the serpents were filled with surprise in their minds. They spoke to one another: 
kimāyāmaṃ ca vistāraṃ kva cāṃtaḥ kva ca pīṭhikā | iti ciṃtānvitā viṣṇumūcuḥ sarve surāstadā || 32 || 	32. “What is the length (of this Liṅga)? What is its girth? Where is its top? Where is its pedestal?” All the Suras who were worried with thoughts like these then said to Viṣṇu: Devas said: 
devā ūcuḥ | asya mūlaṃ tvayā viṣṇo padmodbhava ca mastakam | yuvābhyāṃ ca vilokyaṃ syātsthāne syātparipālakau || 33 || 	33. Its root must be seen by you, O Viṣṇu. O lotus-born Brahmā, its head must be seen by you.[2] Then you can justifiably be called protectors. 
śrutvā tu tau mahābhāgau vaikuṃṭhakamalodbhavau | viṣṇurgato hi pātālaṃ brahmā sarvargaṃ jagāma ha || 34 || 	34. Viṣṇu and the Lotus-bora god Brahmā both of whom were (gods) of exalted fortune, heard this. Viṣṇu went to the nether worlds and Brahmā went to heaven. 
svargaṃ gatastadā brahmā avalokanatatparaḥ | nāpasyattatra liṃgasya mastakaṃ ca vicakṣamaḥ || 35 || 	35. When he reached heaven, Brahmā eagerly looked (everywhere) but that clever (lord) did not see the top of that Liṅga. 
tathā gatena mārgeṇa pratyāvṛttyābjasaṃbhavaḥ | merupṛṣṭhamanuprāptaḥ surabhyā lakṣitastataḥ || 36 || 	36. So the Lotus-born (Lord) returned along the path he had gone and reached the top of Meru. There he was seen by Surabhi (Divine Cow). 
sthitā yā ketakīcchāyāmuvāca madhuraṃ vacaḥ | tasyā vacanamākarṇya sarvalokapitāmahaḥ | uvāca prahasanvākyaṃ chaloktyā surabhiṃ prati || 37 || 	37. She was standing in the shade of a Ketakī plant and spoke to him in sweet words. On hearing her words, the grandfather of all the worlds spoke laughingly to Surabhi in deceptive words: 
liṃgaṃ mahādbhutaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ yenavyāptaṃ jagattrayam | darśanārthaṃ ca tasyāṃtaṃ devaiḥ saṃpreṣitosmayaham || 38 || na dṛṣṭaṃ mastakaṃ tasya vyāpakasya mahātmanaḥ | kiṃ vakṣye'haṃ ca devāgre ciṃtā me cāti vartate || 39 || liṃgasya mastakaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ devānāṃ ca mṛṣā vadeḥ | te sarve yadi vakṣyaṃti iṃdrādyā devatāgaṇāḥ || 40 || 	38-41. “An extraordinarily wonderful Liṅga which has pervaded the entire region of the three worlds was seen; I was deputed by Devas to see its top. I am extremely worried as to what I should report in the presence of Devas as the top of that all-pervading Liṅga of the noble-souled (lord) was not seen. Though it is untrue, you should tell Devas that the top of the Liṅga has been seen. If all the groups of Devas like Indra and others were to ask you, ‘Have you witnessed?’, you shall say quickly, ‘In this matter, O Devas, there are witnesses’. In this matter, O lady of good holy rites, you do be my witness along with the Ketakī flower.” 
tadvacaḥ śirasā gṛhya brahmaṇaḥ parameṣṭhinaḥ | ketakīsahitā tatra surabhī tadamānayat || 42 || 	42-43. Accepting the suggestion of Brahmā Parameṣṭhin with her head (bent down respectfully), Surabhi in the company of the Ketakī flower honoured it. Arriving thus in front of Devas, Brahmā spoke: 
evaṃ samāgato brahma devāgre samuvāca ha || 43 || 	Brahmā said: 
brahmovāca | liṃgasya mastakaṃ devā dṛṣṭavānahamadbhutam | samīcīnaṃ cārtitaṃ ca ketakīdala saṃyutam || 44 || 	44. I have seen the wonderful top of the Liṅga, O Devas, It was duly worshipped by me with Ketakī petals. It is large, soft and spotlessly pure. 
viśālaṃ vimalaṃ ślakṣṇaṃ prasannataramadbhutam | ramyaṃ ca ramaṇīyaṃ ca darśanīyaṃ mahāprabham || 45 || 	45. It is beautiful and fascinating. It is wonderfully lustrous and excessively refulgent. 
etādṛśaṃ mayā dṛṣṭaṃ na dṛṣṭaṃ tadvinākvacit | brahmaṇo hi vacaḥ śrutvā surā vismayamāyayuḥ || 46 || 	46. Such a Liṅga was seen by me. Like that I have not seen anything else anywhere else. On hearing the words of Brahmā, Devas were struck with wonder. 
evaṃ vismayapūrṇāste iṃdrādyā devatāgaṇāḥ | tiṣṭhaṃti tāvatsarveśo viṣṇuradhyātmadīpakaḥ || 47 || pātālādāgataḥ sadyaḥ sarveṣāmavadattvaram | tasyāpyaṃto na dṛṣṭo me hyavalokanatatparaḥ || 48 || vismayo me mahāñjātaḥ pātālātparataścaran | atalaṃ sutalaṃ cāpi nitalaṃ ca rasātalam || 49 || 	47-52. Even as the groups of Devas beginning with Indra stood thus filled with wonder, Viṣṇu, the lord of all, the bestower of spiritual illumination, came there from Pātāla. Immediately he reported to all: “(Although) I was eager to see its end, it (the end of the Liṅga) has not been seen by me. As I was moving further from Pātāla, I was struck with great wonder. I went through Atala, Sutala, Nitala, Rasātala, Pātāla and Tala and Talātala. Everything appeared empty and void. Even the most vacant place of all was examined well. But it has neither root nor middle nor fop. Mahādeva by whom this universe is sustained is the one in the form of Liṅga. It was due to his grace that you and the sages were born.” 
śrutvā surāśca ṛṣayastasya vākyamapūjayan | tadā viṣṇuruvācedaṃ brahmāṇaṃ prahasanniva || 53 || 	53. On hearing his words Suras and sages honoured him. Then Viṣṇu spoke thus laughingly to Brahmā: 
dṛṣṭaṃ hi cettvayā brahmanmastakaṃ paramārthataḥ | sākṣiṇaḥ ke tvayā tatra asminnarthe prakalpitāḥ || 54 || 	54. “If, O Brahmā, the top has been truly seen by you, who are the witnesses you have had in this matter?” 
ākarṇya vacanaṃ viṣṇorbrahmā lokapitāmahaḥ | uvāca tvaritenaiva ketakī surabhīti ca || 55 || te devā mama sākṣitve jānīhi paramārthataḥ | brahmaṇo hi vacaḥ śrutvā sarve devāstvarānvitāḥ || 56 || 	55-58. On hearing the words of Viṣṇu, Brahmā, the grandfather of the worlds, hurriedly said, “Ketakī and Surabhi. O Devas, these two may be known as my eye-witnesses.” On hearing the words of Brahmā, all Devas hurriedly sent for Surabhi along with Ketakī. The two instantaneously came there for the work of Brahmā. 
āhvānaṃ cakrire tasyāḥ surabhyāśca tayā saha | āgate tatkṣamādeva kāryārthaṃ brahmaṇastadā || 57 || iṃdrādyaiśca tadā devairuktā ca surabhī tataḥ | uvāca ketakīsārddhaṃ dṛṣṭo vai brahmaṇā surāḥ || 58 || 	Thereafter Surabhi was asked by Devas beginning with Indra. She said thus together with Ketakī: “Indeed, O Devas, The top of the Liṅga was seen by Brahmā and worshipped with the petals of Ketakī.” 
liṃgasya mastako devāḥ ketakīdalapūjitaḥ | tadā nabhogatā vāṇī sarveṣāṃ śrṛṇvatāmabhūt || 59 || surabhyā caiva yatproktaṃ ketakyā ca tathā surāḥ | tanmṛṣoktaṃ ca jānīdhvaṃ na dṛṣṭo hyasya mastakaḥ || 60 || 	59-60. Even as all of them listened, an ethereal voice was heard from the sky: “Understand, O gods, that what is deposed by Surabhi and Ketakī is a false statement. Its top has not been seen (by Brahmā).” 
tadā sarve'tha vibudhāḥ seṃdrā vai viṣṇunā saha | śepuśca surabhīṃ roṣānmṛṣāvādanatatparām || 61 || 	61. Then all Devas along with Indra and Viṣṇu angrily cursed Surabhi who was intent to utter falsehood: 
mukhenoktaṃ tvayādyaivamanṛtaṃ ca tathā śubhe | apavitraṃ mukhaṃ te'stu sarvadharmabahiṣkṛtam || 62 || 	62. “O splendid one, today a lie has been thus uttered by your mouth, “Let your mouth be unholy and impure. Let it be excluded from all religious rites. 
sugaṃdhaketakī cāpi ayogyā tvaṃ śivārcane | bhaviṣyasi na saṃdeho anṛtā caiva bhāmini || 63 || 	63. Even though fragrant, O Ketakī, you shall be unsuitable for the worship of Śiva. There is no doubt about it, O good lady, that you have lied.” 
tadā nabho gatā vāṇī brahmaṇaṃ ca śaśāpa vai | mṛṣoktaṃ ca tvayā maṃda kimarthaṃ bāliśena hi || 64 || bhṛguṇā ṛṣibhiḥ sākaṃ tathaiva ca purodhasā | tasmādyuyaṃ na pūjyāśca bhaveyuḥ kleśabhāginaḥ || 65 || ṛṣayo'pi ca dharmiṣṭhāstattvavākyabahiṣkṛtāḥ | vivādaniratā mūḍhā atattvajñāḥ samatsarāḥ || 66 || 	64-68. Then the ethereal voice cursed Brahmā: “O stupid one, why has falsehood been uttered childishly by you? (Why have you done this) along with Bhṛgu, the sages and the priest? Hence you will never be worthy of worship. You will suffer from pain. The sages (who ought to be) virtuous will be excluded from truthful statements. They will be deluded, engaged iṇ disputes, jealous and unaware of true knowledge. They will be beggars and worthy of being cut to pieces. They will perpetually ruin their own knowledge. They will boast iof themselves. They will be stubborn and will censure one another.” 
evaṃ śaptāśca munayo brahmādyā devatāstathā | śivena śaptāste sarve liṃgaṃ śaraṇamāyayuḥ || 68 || 	Thus Devas beginning with Brahmā, as well as the sages were cursed. All of them, cursed by Śiva sought refuge in Liṅga. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES: 
| lomaśa uvāca | tadā ca te surāḥ sarva ṛṣayopi bhayānvitāḥ | īḍire liṃgamaiśaṃ ca brahmādyā jñānavihvalāḥ || 1 || 	Lomaśa said: 1. Then all those Suras and even the sages became frightened. Brahmā and others who became perturbed and distressed on account of their knowledge (of their mistake) eulogized the Liṅga of Lord Siva. 
brahmovāca | tvaṃ liṃgarūpī tu mahāprabhāvo vedāṃtavedyosi mahātmarūpi | yenaiva sarve jagadātmamūlaṃ kṛtaṃ sadānaṃdapareṇa nityam || 2 || 	Brahmā said: 2. You who have assumed the Liṅga form, are of great miraculous power. You who are of the form of the Supreme Soul, are knowable (only) through Vedānta (Upaniṣads). It is by you who is ever engrossed in Bliss that the universe which is rooted in you, has been created. 
tvaṃ sākṣī sarvalokānāṃ hartā tvaṃ ca vicakṣaṇaḥ | rakṣaṇosi mahādeva bhairavosi jagatpate || 3 || 	3. You are the witness unto all the worlds. You are the annihilator of all. You are the protector, O Mahādeva. You are Bhairava, O lord of universe. 
tvayā liṃgasvarūpeṇa vyāptametajjagattrayam | kṣudrāścaiva vayaṃ nātha māyāmohitacetasaḥ || 4 || ahaṃ surā'surāḥ sarve yakṣagaṃdharvarākṣasāḥ | pannagāśca piśācāśca tathā vidyādharā hyamī || 5 || 	4. This unit of the three worlds has been pervaded by you in the form of Liṅga. O lord, we are insignificant creatures whose minds are deluded by Māyā. 5. We, viz. I, Suras, Asuras, all the Yakṣas, Ganḍharvas and Rākṣasas, serpents, Piśācas and these Vidyādharas, are all deluded. 
tvaṃhi viśvasṛjāṃ sraṣṭā tvaṃ hi devo jagatpatiḥ | kartā tvaṃ bhuvanasyāsya tvaṃ hartā puruṣaḥ paraḥ || 6 || 	6-7. You are the creator of the creators of the universe. You are indeed the lord and ruler of the universe. You, the Supreme Person, are (both) the creator and annihilator of the universe. 
trāhyasmākaṃ mahādeva devadeva namo'stu te | evaṃ stuto hi vai dhātrā liṃgarūpī maheśvaraḥ || 7 || 	Protect everything belonging to us. O Mahādeva. Obeisance to you, O god of Devas. Thus the great lord in the form of Liṅga was eulogized by Brahma. 
ṛṣayaḥ stotukāmāste maheśvaramakalmaṣam | astuvangīrbhiragryābhiḥ śrutigītābhirādṛtāḥ || 8 || 	8. The sages who were desirous of eulogizing Maheśvara, the sinless one, eulogized with very great eagerness and respect by means of excellent words recorded in the Vedas. 
ṛṣaya ūcuḥ | ajñānino vayaṃ kāmānna viṃdāmo'sya saṃsthitim | tvaṃ hyātmā paramātmā ca prakṛtistvaṃ vibhāvinī || 9 || 	The sages said: 9. We are all ignorant. On account of lust, we do not recognise your status. Indeed you are the Soul, the Supreme Soul. You are the Prakṛti, the evolver (of everything). 
tvameva mātā ca pitā tvameva tvameva baṃdhuśca sakhā tvame | tvamīśvaro vedavidekarūpo mahānubhāvaiḥ pariciṃtyamānaḥ || 10 || 	10. You are our mother. You alone are our father. You are our kinsman. You alone are our friend. You alone are īśvara. You are conversant with the Vedas. You are always meditated upon by persons of great magnanimity. 
tvamātmā sarvabhūtānāmeko jyotirivaidhasām | sarvaṃ bhavati yasmāttvattasmātsarvo'si nityadā || 11 || 	11. You are the immanent Soul of all living beings, like flame of all fuel. Since everything takes its origin from you, you are forever Sarva. 
yasmācca saṃbhavatyetattasmācchaṃbhuriti prabhuḥ || 12 || 	12. The lord is called Śaṃbhu because Śaṃ (happiness) takes its origin from him. 
tvatpādapaṃkajaṃ prāptā vayaṃ sarve surādayaḥ | ṛṣayo devagaṃdharvā vidyādharamahoragāḥ || 13 || 	13. All of us, Devas and others (such as) sages, celestial Ganḍharvas, Vidyādharas, great serpents have resorted to your lotus-like feet. 
tasmācca kṛpayā śaṃbho pāhyasmāñjagataḥ pate || 14 || 	14. Hence, with mercifulness, O Śaṃbhu, O lord of the universe, protect us. 
mahādeva uvāca | śrṛṇudhvaṃ tu vaco me'dya kriyatāṃ ca tvarānvitaiḥ | viṣṇuṃ sarve prārthayaṃtu tvaritena tapodhanāḥ || 15 || 	Mahādeva said: 15. Listen to my word now. Let it be carried out immediately. May all of you pray to Viṣṇu,[1] O ascetics, with immediate effect. 
tasya tadvacanaṃ śrutvā śaṃkarasya mahātmanaḥ | viṣṇuṃ sarve namaskṛtya īḍire ca tadā surāḥ || 16 || 	16. On hearing the word of the noble-souled Śaṅkara, all those Suras bowed down to Viṣṇu and eulogized him. Devas said: 
deva ūcuḥ | vidyādharāḥ suragaṇā ṛṣayaśca sarve trātāstvayādya sakalājagadekabaṃdho | tadvatkṛpākarajanānparipālayādya trailokyanātha jagadīśa jagannivāsa || 17 || 	17. Vidyādharas, groups of Suras, all the sages, everyone has been saved by you today, O sole kinsman of the universe. In that manner, O merciful one, O lord of the three worlds, O lord of the universe, O abode of the universe, protect all the people. 
prahasya bhagavanviṣṇuruvācedaṃ vacastadā | daityaiḥ prapīḍitā yūyaṃ rakṣitāśca purā mayā || 18 || adyaiva bhayamutpannaṃ liṃgādasmācciraṃtanam | na śakyate mayā trātumasmālliṃgabhayātsurāḥ || 19 || 	18-19. \Lord Viṣṇu laughed loudly and spoke these words then: “Formerly you were oppressed by Daityas and protected by me. But today a great danger of everlasting nature has arisen from this Liṅga. It is not possible for me to protect you, O Suras, from the danger from this Liṅga.” 
acyutenaivamuktāste devā ściṃtānvitābhavan | tadā nabhogatā vāṇī uvācāśvāsya vai surān || 20 || 	20. On being told thus by Viṣṇu, Devas became worried. Thereupon an ethereal voice spoke thus, consoling all the Suras: 
etalliṃgaṃ saṃvṛṇuṣva pūjanāya janārdana | piṃḍibhūtvā mahābāho rakṣasva sacarācaram | tatheti matvā bagavānvīrabhadro'bhyapūjayat || 21 || 	21. “O Janārdana, choose this Liṅga for worship. Becoming a mass of refulgence, O mighty one, protect the mobile and immobile beings.” Saying “so be it” and honouring itjñord Vīrabhadra worshipped it.[2] 
brahmādibhaḥ suragaṇaiḥ sahitaistadānīṃ saṃpūjitaḥ śivavidhānarato mahātmā | sravīrabhadraḥ śaśiśekharo'sau śivapriyo rudrasamastrilokyām || 22 || 	22. At that time, the noble-souled Vīrabhadra, having the moon for his crest and engaged in carrying out the orders of Śiva, was worshipped by the groups of Suras beginning with Brahmā, collectively. Vīrabhadra was a favourite of Śiva and was on a par with Rudra in the three worlds. 
liṃgasyārcanayukto'sau vīrabhadro'bhavattadā | tadrūpasyaiva liṃgasya yena sarvamidaṃ jagat || 23 || 	23-24. Then Vīrabhadra was absorbed in worshipping the Liṅga. It (the Liṅga) had the same form wherefrom the entire universe takes it origin, derives sustenance and gets merged with it. The excellent ones among those who are the knowers of the 
udbhāti sthitimāpnoti tathā vilayameti ca | talliṃgaṃ liṃgamityāhurlayanāttattvavittamāḥ || 24 || 	Reality call it Liṅga, because of its being a place of rest (to the absorbed). 
brahmāṇḍāgolakairvyāptaṃ tathā rudrākṣabhūṣitam | tathā liṃgaṃ mahajjātaṃ sarveṣāṃ duratikramam || 25 || 	25. The Liṅga became pervaded by the spheres of the Cosmic Eggs. It was embellished with Rudrākṣas. It grew so large that it could not be surpassed by anyone. 
tadā sarve'tha vibudhā ṛṣo vai mahāprabhāḥ | tuṣṭuvuśca mahāliṃgaṃ vedāvādaiḥ pṛthakpṛthak || 26 || 	26-27. Then all Devas and sages of great lustre eulogized the great Liṅga by means of the Vedic words (Mantras) separately: 
aṇoraṇīyāṃstvaṃ deva tathā tvaṃ mahato mahān | tasmāttvayā vidhātavyaṃ sarvaiṣāṃ liṃgapūjanam || 27 || 	“O lord, you are minuter than the atom. So also you are greater than the greatest. Hence, O lord Śiva, you must make such arrangements as to make the worship of the Liṅga easy for everyone.” 
saurāṣṭre ca tathā liṃgaṃ someśvaramiti smṛtam | tathā sarveśvaraṃ vindhye śrīśaile śikhareśvaram | kāntyāmallālanāthaṃ ca siṃhanāthaṃ ca siṃgale || 33 || virūpākṣaṃ tathā liṃgaṃ koṭiśaṅkarameva ca | tripurāntakaṃ bhīmeśamamareśvarameva ca || 34 || bhogeśvaraṃ ca pātāle hāṭakeśvarameva ca | evamādīnyanekāni liṃgāni bhuvanatraye | sthāpitāni tadā devairviśvopakṛtihetave || 35 || 	28-35. At that time itself, many types of Liṅgas were evolved by Sarva (Śiva)[3], viz. the Brahmeśvara Liṅga in the world called Satya (god Brahmā’s region), Sadāśiva Liṅga in Vaikuṇṭha, a well-established Liṅga named Amareśvara in Amarāvatī (Indra’s capital), Varuṇeśvara Liṅga in the city of Varuṇa, Lord Kāleśvara in the city of Yama, Nairṛteśvara Liṅga in the city of Nirṛti, Pavaneśvara Liṅga in the city of Vāyu, in the Mṛtyuloka[4] Kedāra Liṅga as well as Amareśvara, Oṃkāra Liṅga as well as Mahākāla in the Narmadā (region), Lord Viśveśvara in Kāśī, Laliteśvara in Prayāga, Triyaṃbaka in Brahmagiri (Nasik District) as well as Bhadreśvara in Kali, Drākṣārāmeśvara Liṅga in the place of the Union of Gaṅgā with ocean, the Liṅga remembered as Someśvara in Saurāṣṭra, Sarveśvara Liṅga on the Vindhya, Śikhareśvara Liṅga on Śrīśaila, Mallālanātha[5] (?) in Kānti, Siṃhanātha in Siṅgala (Sīṃhala), so also many Liṅgas such as Virūpākṣa Liṅga, Koṭiśaṅkara, Tripurāntaka, Bhīmeśa, Amareśvara, Bhogeśvara and Hāṭakeśvara in Pātāla. These and many other Liṅgas of this sort were installed in all the three worlds by Devas for helping the entire universe. 
liṃgeśaiśca tathā sarvaiḥ pūrṇamāsījjagattrayam | tathā ca vīrabhadrāṃśāḥ pūjārthamamaraiḥ kṛtāḥ || 36 || 	36. And thus all the three worlds became full of great Liṅgas. Similarly, gods created Vīrabhadrāṃśas (portions of Vīrabhadra) for worship. 
tatra viṃśatisaṃskārāsteṣāmaṣṭādhikābhavan | kathitāḥ śaṃkareṇaiva liṃgasyācanasūcakāḥ || 37 || 	37. There were twenty-eight Saṃskāras (consecratory rites) there in the process of worship of Liṅga. They were mentioned by Śaṅkara himself. 
saṃti rudreṇa kathitāḥ śivadharmā sanātanāḥ | vīrabhadro yathā rudrastathānye guravaḥ smṛtāḥ || 38 || gurorjātāśca guravo vikhyātā bhuvanatraye | liṃgasya mahimāna tu nandī jānāti tattvataḥ || 39 || tathā skando hi bhagavānnye te nāmadhārakāḥ | yathoktāḥ śivadharamā hi nandinā parikīrttitāḥ || 40 || 	38-41. There are eternal Śivadharmas mentioned by Rudra where Vīrabhadra, Rudra and other Gurus (preceptors) are remembered. The sons of Gurus also have become famous in the three worlds as Gurus. Only Nandī knows factually the greatness of Liṅga. So also lord Skanda and those others who bear his names. 
śailādena mahābhāgā vicitrā liṃgadhārakāḥ | śavasyopari liṃgaṃ ca dhriyate ca purātanaiḥ || 41 || 	All the Śivadharmas have been glorified as mentioned by Nandī, the son of Śilāda. Many wonderful persons of exalted nature have been glorified as bearers of Liṅgas.[6] Liṅga is held above a dead body by the ancient people. 
liṃgena saha pañcatvaṃ liṃgena saha jīvitam | ete dharmāḥ supratiṣṭhāḥ śailādena pratiṣṭhitāḥ || 42 || 	42. Living with Liṅga and dying with Liṅga—these virtuous rites have been established by Śailāda (Nandin). 
dharmaḥ pāśupataḥ śreṣṭhaḥ skandena pratipālitaḥ || 43 || śuddhā pañcākṣarī vidyā prāsādī tadanantaram | ṣaḍakṣarī tathā vidyā prāsādasya ca dīpikā || 44 || 	43-45. The religion of the Pāśupata established by Skanda is the most excellent one. The five-syllabled Mantra (Na-maḥ-Śi-vā-ya) is the purest. Then comes the Prāsādī (Oṃkāra) Mantra. The six-syllabled Mantra (Oṃ, na-maḥ-Śi-vā-ya) is the illuminator of the Praṇava.[7] 
skandāttatsamanuprāptamagastyena mahātmanā | paścādācāryabhedena hyāgamā bahavo'bhavan || 45 || 	From Skanda it was acquired by the noble-souled Agastya. Afterwards due to the difference in the preceptors, many Āgamas were composed. 
kiṃ tu vai bahunoktena śvi ityakṣaradvayam | uccārayaṃti sa nityaṃ te rudrā nātra saṃśayaḥ || 46 || 	46. Of what avail is much talk? Those who utter the two syllables Śi-va everyday are Rudras themselves.[8] There is no doubt in this matter. 
satāṃ mārgaṃ puraskṛtya ye sarve te purāṃtakāḥ | vīrā māheśvarājñeyāḥ pāpakṣayakarā nṛṇām || 47 || 	47. Those who follow the path of good people are all Purāntakas (Śiva). They should be known as heroes of Maheśvara.[9] They destroy the sins of men. 
prasaṃgenānupaṃkṣeṇa śradvayā ca yadṛcchayā | śivabhaktiṃ prakurvanti ye vai te yāṃti sadgatim || 48 || 	48. Those who perform rites of devotion incidentally, as a consequence of something else, by chance or as an act of faith, attain the goal of the good. 
śrṛṇudhvaṃ kathayāmīha itihāsaṃ purātanam | kṛtaṃ śivālayaṃ yacca pataṃgyā mārjanaṃ purā || 49 || 	49. Listen. I shall narrate an old legend in this connection. Sweeping was performed formerly by a female bird in a temple of Śiva. 
āgatā bhakṣaṇārthaṃ hi naivedyaṃ kena cārpitam | mārjanaṃ rajastasyāḥ pakṣābhyāmabhavatpurā || 50 || 	50. It had come (into the temple) for the sake of food. The Naivedya was offered by someone. When it fluttered its wings, the dust particles happened to be swept away. 
tena karmavipākena uttamaṃ svargamāgatā | bhuktvā svargasukhaṃ cograṃ punaḥ saṃsāramāgatā || 51 || 	51. As a result of that meritorious deed, she went to the excellent heaven. After enjoying the heavenly pleasures, she came back to the fierce world once again. 
kāśirājasutā jātā sundarīnāma viśrutā | pūrvābhyāsācca kalyāṇī babhūva paramā satī || 52 || 	52. She was born as the daughter of the king of Kāśī. She became famous by the name Sundarī. Thanks to the previous experience, that girl of auspicious features became a great chaste lady. 
uṣasyuṣasi tanvaṃgī śivadvāraratā sadā | saṃmārjanaṃ ca kurute bhaktyā paramayā yutā || 53 || 	53. Early in the morning, the lady of slender limbs was always present at the doorway of the temple of Śiva. With great devotion she used to sweep the premises. 
svayameva tadā devī sundarī rājakanyakā | tathābhūtāṃ ca tāṃ dṛṣṭvā ṛṣiruddālako'bravīt || 54 || 	54. The gentle princess, Sundarī, did everything herself. On seeing her in that activity, Uddālaka, the sage, enquired: 
sukumārī satī bāle svayameva kathaṃ śubhe | saṃmārjanaṃ ca kuruṣe kanyake tvaṃ śucismite || 55 || 	55-56. “O girl of splendid features, you are delicate in body. Why do you sweep yourself, O girl of bright smiles? O gentle lady, you have in front of you many men and women servants. At your bidding they will do all the sweeping work etc.” 
ṛṣestadvacanaṃ śrutvā prahasyedamuvāca ha || 57 || 	57. On hearing those words of the sage, she laughingly said thus: 
śivasevāṃ prakurvāṇāḥ śivabhaktipuraskṛtāḥ | ye narāścaiva nāryyaśca śivalokaṃ vrajaṃti vai || 58 || saṃmārjanaṃ ca pāṇibhyāṃ padbhyāṃ yānaṃ śivālaye | tasmānmayā ca kriyate saṃmārjanamataṃdritam || 59 || 	58-60a. “The men and women who render service to Śiva, those who are prompted by devotion to Śiva, do go to the world of Śiva. The sweeping must be done by one’s own hands. One should go to the temple on one’s own foot. Hence, sweeping is done by me unweariedly. I do not know anything else, excepting the single act of sweeping.”[10] 
anayā kiṃ kṛtaṃ pūrvaṃ keyaṃ kasya prasādataḥ | tadā jñānaṃ ca ṛṣiṇā tatsarvaṃ jñānacakṣuṣā | vismayena samāviṣṭastūṣṇīṃbhūto'bhavattadā || 61 || 	60b-62. On hearing her words, the sage pondered: ‘Who is she? What has been done by her previously? By whose favour (did she get all these)?’ Then everything was understood by the sage through the eye of (the power of his) spiritual knowledge. 
savismayo'bhūdatha tadviditvā uddālako jñānavatāṃ variṣṭhaḥ | śivaprabhāvaṃ manasā viciṃtya jñānātparaṃ bodhamavāpa śāṃtaḥ || 62 || 	63. Struck with wonder, he became silent. After knowing it, he became surprised. Thinking about the power of Śiva, Uddālaka, the most excellent among the learned ones, attained the greatest enlightenment. He became calm and quiescent. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES: This is how Purāṇas tried to bring together followers of Śaivism and Vaiṣṇavism. 
| lomaśa uvāca | taskaro'pi purā brahmansarvadharmabāhiṣkṛtaḥ | brahmaghno'sau surāpaśca suvarṇasya ca taskaraḥ || 1 || 	Or, was Vīrabhadra worshipped by them? The next verse shows that Vīrabhadra was worshipped by Suras. 
laṃpaṭohi mahāpāpa uttamastrīṣu sarvadā | dyūtakārī sadā maṃdaḥ kitavaiḥ saha saṃgataḥ || 2 || 	In Mantra Śāstra, Oṃkāra Bīja is called Prāsāda. 
ekadā krīḍatā tena hāritaṃ dyūtamadbhutam | kitavairmardyamāno hi tadā novāca kiñcana || 3 || 	1-3. O Brāhmaṇas, once there was a great sinner[1] He was a thief. He was excommunicated from all religious rites. He was a Brāhmaṇa-slayer, a drink-addict and a thief of gold. He sought the company of excellent women in an illicit way. He was stupid and slow and always engaged in gambling along with gamblers and cunning fellows. Once while playing, he lost wonderfully (large amount). Smashed and hit by rogues and gamblers, he did not speak anything. 
pīḍito'pyabhavattūṣṇīṃ tairuktaḥ pāpakṛttamaḥ | dyūte tvayā ca taddravyaṃ hāritaṃ kiṃ prayacchasi || 4 || no vā tatkathyatāṃ śīghraṃ yāthātathyena durmate | yaddhāritaṃ prayacchāmi rātrāvityabravīcca saḥ || 5 || 	4-5. Though he was harassed and tormented, he kept quiet. Then that great sinner was asked thus by them: “You have lost this much wealth in the game of dice. Are you going to give it or not? O wicked fellow, let this be told immediately and precisely.” Then he said: “What has been lost by me, I shall give at night.” 
tairmuktastena vākyena gatāste kitavādayaḥ | tadā niśīthasamaye gato'sau śivamaṃdiram || 6 || 	6. Thanks to that statement, he was released by them. Those gamblers and rogues then went away. Then at mid-night he went to the temple of Śiva. 
śirodhiruhya śambhośca ghaṇṭāmādātumudyataḥ | tāvatkailāsaśikhare śaṃbhuḥ provāca kiṃkarān || 7 || 	7. Climbing on to the head of Śaṃbhu, he attempted to take the bell. At that time on the peak of Kailāsa, Śaṃbhu said to his servants: 
anena yatkṛtaṃ cādya sarveṣāmadhikaṃ bhuvi | sarveṣāmeva bhaktānāṃ variṣṭho'yaṃ ca matpriyaḥ || 8 || 	8. “What has been done by this fellow today is far superior to anything done by anyone on the earth. He is the most excellent one among all my devotees, hence he is my great favourite.” 
iti proktvāna yāmāsa vīrabhadrādibhirgaṇaiḥ | te sarve tvaritā jagmuḥ kailāsācchivavallabhāt || 9 || 	9. After saying this, he commanded the Gaṇas beginning with Vīrabhadra to bring him (the thief-gambler). They hurriedly started from Kailāsa, the favourite (resort) of Śiva. 
sarvairḍamarunādena nāditaṃ bhuvanatrayam | tāndṛṣṭvā sahasottīrya taskarosau durātmavān | liṃgasya mastakātsadyaḥ palāyanaparo'bhavat || 10 || 	10. The three worlds were filled with the sound of Ḍamarus by all of them. On seeing them, the evil-minded thief got down suddenly from the top of the Liṅga and took to his heels immediately. 
palāyamānaṃ taṃ dṛṣṭvā vīrabhadraḥ samāhvayat || 11 || kasmādvibhepi re manda devadevo mahesvaraḥ | prasannastava jātodya udāracarito hyasau || 12 || 	11-14. On seeing him fleeing, Vīrabhadra called him: “Whom do you fear, O stupid fellow? Maheśvara, the lord of Devas, has been pleased with you, as he is very liberal-minded.” 
ityuktvā taṃ vimāne ca kṛtvā kailāsamāyayau | pārṣado hi kṛtastena taskaro hi mahātmanā || 13 || 	After saying thus and placing him in the aerial chariot, he came to Kailāsa. The thief was made an attendant by that noble-souled (lord). 
tasmādbhāvyā śive bhaktiḥ sarveṣāmapi dehinām | paśavo'pi hi pūjyāḥ syuḥ kiṃ punarmānavābhuvi || 14 || ye tārkikāstarkaparāstatha mīmāṃsakāśca ye | anyonyavādinaścānye cānye vātmavitarkakāḥ || 15 || 	Hence, devotion to Śiva must be preserved and cultivated by all embodied beings. Even animals will be worthy of being worshipped thereby. What to say of men on the earth? 
ekavākyaṃ na kurvaṃti śivārcanabahiṣkṛtāḥ | tarko hi kriyate yaiśca tesarve kiṃ śivaṃ vinā || 16 || 	15-16. The followers of Tarka-śāstra are engaged in abstract reasoning and arguments.[2] So are the followers of the Mīmāṃsā School. They go on arguing and disputing among themselves. And there are others who deliberate on and discuss about the existence, nature etc. of the Soul, but never reach any unanimity, or reconciliation of (their) differences. They are excluded from the worship of Śiva. Without Śiva, of what significance are they, by whom only arguments are forwarded? 
tathā kiṃ bahunoktena sarve'pi sthirajaṃgamāḥ | prāṇino'pi hi jāyaṃte kevalaṃ liṃgadhāriṇaḥ || 17 || 	17. Of what avail is much talk? All mobile and immobile beings, all animals too, are born bearing the Liṅga. 
piṇḍīyuktaṃ yatā liṃgaṃ sthāpitaṃ ca yathā'bhavat | tathā narā liṃgayuktāḥ piṇḍībhūtāstatā striyaḥ || 18 || 	18. Just as the Liṅga is placed (and consecrated) in conjunction with the Piṇḍī (globular solid pedestal), so also men are endowed with Liṅgas and women afe Piṇḍīs. 
śivaśaktiyutaṃ sarvaṃ jagadetaccarācaram | taṃ śivaṃ mauḍhyatastyaktvā mūḍhāścānyaṃ bhajaṃti ye || 19 || 	19. The entire universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings is endowed with (the union of) Śiva and Śakti. Those are foolish fellows who, out of delusion, eschew devotion to such Śiva and worship others. 
dharmamātyaṃtikaṃ tucchaṃ naśvaraṃ kṣaṇabhaṃguram | yo viṣṇuḥ sa śivo jñeyo yaḥ śivo viṣṇureva saḥ || 20 || 	20. Their Dharma is extremely insignificant, perishable and momentary. He who is Viṣṇu should be known as Śiva. He who is Śiva is Viṣṇu alone.[3] 
pīṭhikā viṣṇurūpaṃ syālliṃgarūpī maheśvaraḥ | tasmālliṃgārcanaṃ śreṣṭhaṃ sarveṣāmapi vai dvijāḥ || 21 || 	21. The pedestal is the form of Viṣṇu and Maheśvara is in the form of Liṅga. Hence the worship of Liṅga, O Brāhmaṇas, is excellent for everyone. 
brahmā maṇimayaṃ liṃgaṃ pūjayatyaniśaṃ śubham | indro ratnamayaṃ liṃgaṃ candro muktāmayaṃ tathā || 22 || 	22. Brahmā worships a Ruby-Liṅga always, Indra worships a Liṅga made of gems and Candra (the Moon-god) one of pearls. 
bhānustāmramayaṃ liṃgaṃ pūjayatyaniśaṃ śubham | raukmaṃ liṃgaṃ kuberaśca pāśī cāraktameva ca || 23 || 	23. Bhānu (the Sun-god) always worships a splendid copper (-coloured) Liṅga. Kubera worships a golden Liṅga and Varuṇa a Liṅga red in colour. 
yamo nīlamayaṃ liṃgaṃ rājataṃ nairṛtastathā | kāśmīraṃ pavano liṃgamarcayatyaniśaṃ vibhoḥ || 24 || 	24. Yama worships a sapphire Liṅga, Nairṛta worships a silver Liṅga, Pavana (Wind-god) always worships a saffron Liṅga of the lord. 
evaṃ te liṃgitāḥ sarve lokapālāḥ savāsavāḥ | tathā sarve'pi pātāle gaṃdharvāḥ kiṃnaraiḥ saha || 25 || 	25. Thus, all Guardians of the Quarters including Indra have been characterised as worshippers of Liṅga. So are all (persons) in the nether world and also Gandharvas and Kinnaras. 
daityānāṃ vaiṣṇavāḥ kecitprahlādapramukhā dvijāḥ | tathāhi rākṣasānāṃ ca vibhīṣaṇapurogamāḥ || 26 || baliśca namuciścaiva hiraṇyakaśipustathā | vṛṣaparvā vṛṣaścaiva saṃhrādo bāṇa eva ca || 27 || 	26-27. Among Daityas, O Brāhmaṇas, there are certain devotees of Viṣṇu, the chief of whom was Prahlāda.[4] So also among Rākṣasas, those having Vibhīṣaṇa as their leader. So also (were) Bali, Namuci, Hiraṇyakaśipu, Vṛṣaparvan, Vṛṣa, Saṃhrāda and Bāṇa. 
ete cānye ca bahavaḥ śiṣyāḥ śukrasya dhīmataḥ | evaṃ śivārcanaratāḥ sarve te daityadānavāḥ || 28 || rākṣasā eva te sarve śivapūjānvitāḥ sadā | hetiḥ prahetiḥ saṃyātirvighasaḥ praghasastathā || 29 || 	28. These and many others who were the disciples of the intelligent Śukra were engaged in worshipping Śiva. All these Daityas and Dānavas (were devotees of Śiva). 
vidyujjihvastīkṣṇadaṃṣṭro dhūmrākṣo bhīmavikramaḥ | mālī caiva sumālī ca mālyavānatibhīṣamaḥ || 30 || vidyutkaiśastaḍijjihvo rāvaṇaśca mahābalaḥ | kuṃbhakarṇo durādharṣo vegadarśī pratāpavān || 31 || ete hi rākṣasāḥ śreṣṭhā śivārcanaratāḥ sadā | liṃgamabhyarcya ca sadā siddhiṃ prāptāḥ purā tu te || 32 || 	29-32. All the following were Rākṣasas and they were always engaged in the worship of Śiva. They were: Heti, Praheti, Saṃyāti, Vighasa, Praghasa, Vidyujjihva, Tīkṣṇadaṃṣṭra, Dhūmrākṣa of terrible valour, Mālī, Sumālī and the extremely terrible Mālyavān, Vidyutkeśa, Tadijjihva, Rāvaṇa of great strength, the invincible Kuṃbhakarṇa and Vegadarśī of great valour. These were great Rākṣasas, who were always engaged in worshipping Śiva. After worshipping the Liṅga formerly, they had always attained Siddhi. 
rāvaṇena tapastaptaṃ sarveṣāmapi duḥkhaham | tapodhipo mahādevastutoṣa ca tadā bhṛśam || 33 || 	33. A severe penance unbearable to all was performed by Ṛāvaṇa. Then Mahādeva, the lord of penance, became much pleased. 
varānprāyacchata tadā sarveṣāmapi durlabhān | jñānaṃ vijñānasahitaṃ labdhaṃ tena sadāśivāt || 34 || ajeyatvaṃ ca saṃgrāme dvaiguṇyaṃ śirasāmapi | paṃcavaktro mahā devo daśavaktro'tha rāvaṇaḥ || 35 || 	34-35. He granted him boons very difficult to be achieved by all others. Wisdom with perfect knowledge was obtained by him from Sadāśiva. He further obtained (invinicibility) in battle and twice the number of heads (as those of god Śiva), for Mahādeva had only five faces, whereas Rāvaṇa had ten faces. 
devānṛṣīnpitṝṃścaiva nirjitya tapasā vibhuḥ | maheśasya prasādācca sarveṣāmadhiko'bhavat || 36 || 	36. Thanks to the grace of Maheśa, that powerful (Rākṣasa) defeated Devas, sages and manes by means of his penance and became superior to all. 
rājā trikūṭādhipatirmaheśena kṛto mahān | sarveṣāṃ rākṣasānāṃ ca paramāsanamāstitaḥ || 37 || 	37. He was made the great king and ruler of Trikūṭa by Maheśa. He occupied the greatest and most excellent position (seat) among Rākṣasas. 
tapasvināṃ parīkṣāyai yadṛṣīṇāṃ vihiṃsanam | kṛtaṃ tena tadā viprā rāvaṇena tapasvinā || 38 || 	38. It was for testing (the enduring capacity of) the sages that he harassed them. Violence towards the sages was indulged in, O Brāhmaṇas, by Rāvaṇa who was himself an ascetic, only because he wanted to test them. 
ajeyo hi mahāñjāto rāvaṇo lokarāvaṇaḥ | sṛṣṭyaṃtaraṃ kṛtaṃ yena prasādācchaṃkarasya ca || 39 || 	39. Rāvaṇa who made the whole world cry and scream, became great and invincible. Thanks to the grace and favour of Śaṅkara, another creation was evolved by him. 
lokapālā jitāstena pratāpena tapasvinā | brahmāpi vijito yena tapasā parameṇa hi || 40 || 	40. The guardians of the worlds were conquered by that ascetic by means of his valour. Brahmā too was subdued by him only through great penance. 
amṛtāṃśukaro bhūtvā jito yena śaśī dvijāḥ | dāhakatvājjito vahnirīśaḥ kailāsatolanāt || 41 || 	41. By becoming the nectar-rayed one, he conquered the Moon, O Brāhmaṇas. Through the power of burning, the Fire-god was conquered and Īśa (himself) was conquered by lifting up Kailāsa (mountain). 
aiśvaryeṇa jitaścendro viṣṇuḥ sarvagatastathā | liṃgārcanaprasādena trailokyaṃ ca vaśīkṛtam || 42 || 	42. Indra was conquered by means of his Aiśvarya (power and prosperity). So also Viṣṇu, the omnipresent one. By worshipping and propitiating the Liṅga, all the three worlds were controlled by him. 
tadā sarve suragaṇā brahmaviṣṇupurogamāḥ | merupṛṣṭhaṃ samāsādya sumaṃtraṃ cakrire tadā || 43 || 	43. At that time, all the groups of Suras, with Brahmā and Viṣṇu as their leaders, gathered together on the top of Mem and began their deliberation and discussion: 
pīḍitāḥ smo rāvaṇena tapasā duṣkareṇa vai | gokarṇākhye girau devāḥ śrūyatāṃ paramādbhutam || 44 || sākṣālliṃgārcanaṃ yena kṛtamasti mahātmanā | jñānajñeyaṃ jñānagamyaṃ yadyatparamamadbhutam | tatkṛtaṃ rāvaṇenaiva sarveṣāṃ duratikramam || 45 || 	44-45. “We have been tormented by Rāvaṇa through his penance, very difficult to be performed (by others). O Devas, let this wonderful story be listened to. On the mountain named Gokarṇa, worship of the Liṅga itself was performed by that noble-souled (hero). What could be known only through knowledge, what could be achieved only through knowledge, whatever.great miracle was there, that which is very difficult to be surpassed by everyone—all these were done by Rāvaṇa alone. 
vairāgyaṃ paramāsthāya audāryaṃ ca tato'dhikam | tenaiva mamatā tyaktā rāvaṇena mahātmanā || 46 || 	46. He had adopted the greatest vairāgya (detachment) as well as liberal-midedness [mindedness/mindness?] greater even than that (vairāgya). The feeling of mamatā (mineness [mindness?]) was eschewed by the noble-souled Rāvaṇa. 
saṃvatsarasahasrācca svaśiro hi mahābhujaḥ | kṛttvā kareṇa liṃgasya pūjanārthaṃ samarpayat || 47 || 	47. After a period of a thousand years, that (hero) of great arms cut one of his own head and offered it with his own hand, for the sake of worshipping the Liṅga. 
rāvaṇasya kabaṃdhaṃ ca tadagre ca samīpataḥ | yogadhāraṇayā yuktaṃ parameṇa samādhinā || 48 || 	48. Ṛāvaṇa’s body short of one head stood in front of it in the vicinity. īt was endowed with Yogic dhāraṇā (steady abstraction) and the greatest samādhi (concentration). 
liṃge layaṃ samādhāya kayāpi kalayā sthitam | anyacchirovivṛścyaivaṃ tenāpi śivapūjanam | kṛtaṃ naivānyamuninā tathā caivāpareṇahi || 49 || 	49. Fixing his attention deeply on the Liṅga after about a kalā, he cut off another head and worshipped Śiva with it. Such (performance of) worship was never done by any sage nor by anyone else. 
evaṃ śirāṃsyeva bahūni tena samarpitānyeva śivārcanārthe | bhūtvā kabaṃdho hi punaḥ punaśca śivo'sau varado babhūva || 50 || 	50. Thus many heads were chopped off and offered by him in worshipping Śiva. Again and again he became a headless body. Then Śiva became a bestower of boons. 
mayā vināsurastatra piṃḍībhūtena vai purā | varānvaraya paulastya yatheṣṭaṃ tāndadāmyaham || 51 || 	51. ‘Formerly without being myself transformed into a Piṇḍī...[5] O descendant of Pulastya, choose boons as you please. I shall grant you the same.’ 
rāvaṇena tadā coktaḥ śivaḥ paramamaṃgalaḥ | yadi prasanno bhagavandeyo me vara uttamaḥ || 52 || na kāmaye'nyaṃ ca varamāśraye tvatpadāṃbujam | yathā tathā pradātavyaṃ yadyasti ca kṛpā mayi || 53 || 	52-53. Then Śiva of greatest auṣpiciousness was requested by Rāvaṇa: ‘If Your Lordship are pleased, the excellent boon should be given to me. I do not wish to seek any other boon. If you have merciful favour towards me, you should give me such a boon whereby I (always) resort to your feet.’ 
tadā sadāśivenokto rāvaṇo lokarāvaṇaḥ | matprasādācca sarvaṃ tvaṃ prāpsyase manasepsitam || 54 || 	54. Then Rāvaṇa who made the world cry and scream was told by Sādāśiva: ‘By my favour, you will obtain everything mentally desired by you.’ 
evaṃ prāptaṃ śivātsarvaṃ rāvaṇena sureśvarāḥ | tasmātsarvairbhavadbhiśca tapasā parameṇa hi || 55 || 	55-59. It was thus, O leading Suras, that everything was. obtained by Rāvaṇa from Śiva. Hence this Rāvaṇa should be subdued by you all only through great penance. This is what I think.” 
ciṃtāmāpedire sarve ciraṃ te viṣayānvitāḥ | brahmāpi ceṃdriyagrastaḥ sutā ramitumudyataḥ || 57 || 	On hearing the words of Acyuta, the groups of Devas beginning with Brahmā became anxious, because all of them had been addicted to sensual pleasures. 
iṃdro hi jārabhāvācca caṃdro hi gurutalpagaḥ | yamaḥ kadaryabhāvācca caṃcalatvātsadāgatiḥ || 58 || pāvakaḥ sarvabhakṣitvāttathānye devatāgaṇāḥ | aśaktā rāvaṇaṃ jetuṃ tapasā ca vijṛṃbhitam || 59 || 	Brahmā was overpowered by sexual desire and he attempted sexual act with his own daughter. Indra was an adulterer. Candra (the Moon-god) defiled the bed of his Guru (preceptor Bṛhaspati). Yama has been avaricious and stingy. Sadāgati (the Wind-god) has been fickle. Pāvaka has been indiscriminate in eating anything and everything. The others among the groups of Devas (had similar defects). Hence, all these were incapable of conquering Rāvaṇa who had become very great by means of penance. 
śailādo hi mahātejā gaṇaśreṣṭhaḥ purātanaḥ | buddhi mānnītinipuṇo mahābalaparākramī || 60 || 	60. Śailāda was an elderly excellent Gaṇa of great splendour. He was intelligent, an expert in adopting the right course of action, highly powerful and very valorous. 
śivapriyo rudrarūpī mahātmā hyuvāca sarvānatha ceṃdramukhyān | kasmādyūyaṃ saṃbhramādāgatāśca etatsarvaṃ kathyatāṃ vistareṇa || 61 || 	61-62. He was a favourite of Śiva and was identical with Rudra. The noble-souled one asked all of them led by Indra, “Why have you all come here in great excitement? Let the whole thing be reported in detail.” 
naṃdinā ca tadā sarve pṛṣṭāḥ procustvarānvitāḥ || 62 || devā ūcuḥ | rāvaṇena vayaṃ sarve nirjitā munibhiḥ saha | prasādayitumāyātāḥ śivaṃ lokeśvareśvaram || 63 || 	On being asked by Nandi, all of them hurriedly said then: Devas said: 63. All of us along with the sages have been conquered by Rāvaṇa. We have come to propitiate Śiva, the lord of the lords, of the worlds. 
prahasya bhagavānnaṃdī brahmāṇaṃ vai hyuvāca ha | kva yūyaṃ kva śivaḥ śaṃbhustapasā parameṇa hi | draṣṭavyo hṛdi madhyasthaḥ so'dya draṣṭuṃ na pāryate || 64 || 	64. Lord Nandī laughed and said to Brahmā: “Where are you? Where is auspicious Śaṃbhu? (There is a world of difference between you two.) By means of great penance, he should be seen seated in the middle of the heart. He cannot be seen today. 
yāvadbhāvā hyanekāśca iṃdriyārthāstathaiva ca | yāvacca mamatābhāvastāvadīśo hi durlabhaḥ || 65 || 	65. As long as the emotional attitudes are too many, the objects of senses are plentiful and there is the feeling of mineness, so long Īśa is very difficult to be attained. 
jiteṃdriyāṇāṃ śāṃtānāṃ tanniṣṭhānāṃ mahātmanām | sulabho liṃgarūpī syādbhavatāṃ hi sudurlabhaḥ || 66 || 	66. Śiva in the form of the Liṅga is easy of access to those noble-souled ones who have subdued the senses, are quiescent and have stabilized themselves in him. He is very difficult to be obtained by you all.” 
tadā brahmādayo devā ṛṣayaśca vipaścitaḥ | praṇamya naṃdinaṃ prāhuḥ kasmāttvaṃ vānarānanaḥ | tatsarvaṃ kathayānyaṃ ca rāvaṇasya tapobalam || 67 || 	67. Then Brahma and other Devas as well as the learned sages bowed down to Nandī and said: “Why do you have the face of a monkey?[6] Tell us everything about it. Tell us about the power of the penance of Rāvaṇa.” Nandīśvara said: 
naṃdīśvara uvāca | kubero'dhikṛtastena śaṃkareṇa mahātmanā | dhanānāmādipatye ca taṃ draṣṭuṃ rāvaṇo'tra vai || 68 || āgacchattvarayā yuktaḥ samāruhya svavāhanam | māṃ dṛṣṭvā cābravītkruddhaḥ kubero hyatra āgataḥ || 69 || 	68-70a. Kubera had been made by the noble-souled Śaṅkara the over-lord of wealth and assets. Rāvaṇa came here to see him, riding in his own vehicle. He was in a hurry. On seeing me, he said furiously: “Did Kubera come here? Was he seen by you here? Let this be told immediately.” 
tvayā dṛṣṭo'tha vātrāsau kathyatāmavilaṃbitam | kiṃ kāryaṃ dhanadenādya iti pṛṣṭo mayā hi saḥ || 70 || 	70b-72. He was asked by me: “What have you to do with Dhanada (Kubera) today?” 
tadovāca mahātejā rāvaṇo lokarāvaṇaḥ | mayyaśraddhānvito bhūtvā viṣayātmā sudurmadaḥ || 71 || śikṣāpayitumārabdho maivaṃ kāryamiti prabho | yathāhaṃ ca śriyā yukta āḍhyo'haṃ balavānaham | tathā tvaṃ bhava re mūḍha mā mūḍhatvamupārjaya || 72 || 	Then Rāvaṇa of great splendour, who made the world scream, said: “At the outset he (Kubera) had been indifferent towards me. He did not care for me. Addicted to sensual pleasures, as he is, he has been highly arrogant. He began to teach me saying, ‘O lord, it should not be done like this. Just as I am endowed with glory and splendour, just as I am rich and strong, so also you do become, O fool. Do not get into delusion and stupidity.’ 
ahaṃ mūḍhaḥ kṛtastena kubereṇa mahātmanā | mayā nirākṛto roṣāttapastepe sa guhyakaḥ || 73 || 	73. I have been made a fool and a deluded person by the noble-souled Kubera. On being turned out by me angrily, that Guḥyaka (i.e. Kubera) performed penance. 
kuberaḥ sa hi naṃdinkimāgatastava maṃdiram | dīyatāṃ ca kuberodya nātra kāryā vicāraṇā || 74 || 	74. Did that Kubera come, O Nandī, to your abode? Let that Kubera be handed over (to me). You need not hesitate in this matter.” 
rāvaṇasya vacaḥ śrutvā hyavocaṃ tvarito'pyaham | liṃgakosi mahābhāga tvamahaṃ ca tathāvidhaḥ || 75 || ubhayoḥ samanāṃ jñātvā vṛthā jalpasi durmate | yathoktaḥ sa tvavādīnmāṃ vadanārthe baloddhataḥ || 76 || 	75-79. On hearing the words of Rāvaṇa, I hurriedly replied: “You are a Liṅgaka (worshipper of Liṅga), an exalted one. I too am one like that. Knowing the equality between us both you are prattling in vain, O vicious one.”
