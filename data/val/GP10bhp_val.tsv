om namaḥ bhagavate vāsudevāya janma ādi asya yataḥ anvayāt itarataḥ ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ sva rāṭ tene brahma hṛdā yaḥ ādi kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ tejaḥ vāri mṛdām yathā vinimayaḥ yatra tri sargaḥ amṛṣā dhāmnā svena sadā nirasta kuhakam satyam param dhīmahi	O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.
dharmaḥ projjhita kaitavaḥ atra paramaḥ nirmatsarāṇām satām vedyam vāstavam atra vastu śivadam tāpa traya unmūlanam śrīmat bhāgavate mahā muni kṛte kim vā paraiḥ īśvaraḥ sadyaḥ hṛdi avarudhyate atra kṛtibhiḥ śuśrūṣubhiḥ tat kṣaṇāt	Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bhāgavata Purāṇa propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bhāgavatam, compiled by the great sage Vyāsadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bhāgavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.
nigama kalpa taroḥ galitam phalam śuka mukhāt amṛta drava saṁyutam pibata bhāgavatam rasam ālayam muhuḥ aho rasikāḥ bhuvi bhāvukāḥ	O expert and thoughtful men, relish Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.
naimiṣe animiṣa kṣetre ṛṣayaḥ śaunaka ādayaḥ satram svargāya lokāya sahasra samam āsata	Once, in a holy place in the forest of Naimiṣāraṇya, great sages headed by the sage Śaunaka assembled to perform a great thousand-year sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord and His devotees.
te ekadā tu munayaḥ prātaḥ huta huta agnayaḥ sat kṛtam sūtam āsīnam papracchuḥ idam ādarāt	One day, after finishing their morning duties by burning a sacrificial fire and offering a seat of esteem to Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī, the great sages made inquiries, with great respect, about the following matters.
ṛṣayaḥ ūcuḥ tvayā khalu purāṇāni sa itihāsāni ca anagha ākhyātāni api adhītāni dharma śāstrāṇi yāni uta	The sages said: Respected Sūta Gosvāmī, you are completely free from all vice. You are well versed in all the scriptures famous for religious life, and in the Purāṇas and the histories as well, for you have gone through them under proper guidance and have also explained them.
yāni veda vidām śreṣṭhaḥ bhagavān bādarāyaṇaḥ anye ca munayaḥ sūta parāvara vidaḥ viduḥ	Being the eldest learned Vedāntist, O Sūta Gosvāmī, you are acquainted with the knowledge of Vyāsadeva, who is the incarnation of Godhead, and you also know other sages who are fully versed in all kinds of physical and metaphysical knowledge.
vettha tvam saumya tat sarvam tattvataḥ tat anugrahāt brūyuḥ snigdhasya śiṣyasya guravaḥ guhyam api uta	And because you are submissive, your spiritual masters have endowed you with all the favors bestowed upon a gentle disciple. Therefore you can tell us all that you have scientifically learned from them.
tatra tatra añjasā āyuṣman bhavatā yat viniścitam puṁsām ekāntataḥ śreyaḥ tat naḥ śaṁsitum arhasi	Please, therefore, being blessed with many years, explain to us, in an easily understandable way, what you have ascertained to be the absolute and ultimate good for the people in general.
prāyeṇa alpa āyuṣaḥ sabhya kalau asmin yuge janāḥ mandāḥ sumanda matayaḥ manda bhāgyāḥ hi upadrutāḥ	O learned one, in this iron Age of Kali men almost always have but short lives. They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.
bhūrīṇi bhūri karmāṇi śrotavyāni vibhāgaśaḥ ataḥ sādho atra yat sāram samuddhṛtya manīṣayā brūhi bhadrāya bhūtānām yena ātmā suprasīdati	There are many varieties of scriptures, and in all of them there are many prescribed duties, which can be learned only after many years of study in their various divisions. Therefore, O sage, please select the essence of all these scriptures and explain it for the good of all living beings, that by such instruction their hearts may be fully satisfied.
sūta jānāsi bhadram te bhagavān sātvatām patiḥ devakyām vasudevasya jātaḥ yasya cikīrṣayā	All blessings upon you, O Sūta Gosvāmī. You know for what purpose the Personality of Godhead appeared in the womb of Devakī as the son of Vasudeva.
tat naḥ śuśrūṣamāṇānām arhasi aṅga anuvarṇitum yasya avatāraḥ bhūtānām kṣemāya ca bhavāya ca	O Sūta Gosvāmī, we are eager to learn about the Personality of Godhead and His incarnations. Please explain to us those teachings imparted by previous masters [ācāryas], for one is uplifted both by speaking them and by hearing them.
āpannaḥ saṁsṛtim ghorām yat nāma vivaśaḥ gṛṇan tataḥ sadyaḥ vimucyeta yat bibheti svayam bhayam	Living beings who are entangled in the complicated meshes of birth and death can be freed immediately by even unconsciously chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, which is feared by fear personified.
yat pāda saṁśrayāḥ sūta munayaḥ praśamāyanāḥ sadyaḥ punanti upaspṛṣṭāḥ svardhunī āpaḥ anusevayā	O Sūta, those great sages who have completely taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord can at once sanctify those who come in touch with them, whereas the waters of the Ganges can sanctify only after prolonged use.
kaḥ vā bhagavataḥ tasya puṇya śloka īḍya karmaṇaḥ śuddhi kāmaḥ na śṛṇuyāt yaśaḥ kali mala apaham	Who is there, desiring deliverance from the vices of the age of quarrel, who is not willing to hear the virtuous glories of the Lord?
tasya karmāṇi udārāṇi parigītāni sūribhiḥ brūhi naḥ śraddadhānānām līlayā dadhataḥ kalāḥ	His transcendental acts are magnificent and gracious, and great learned sages like Nārada sing of them. Please, therefore, speak to us, who are eager to hear, about the adventures He performs in His various incarnations.
atha ākhyāhi hareḥ dhīman avatāra kathāḥ śubhāḥ līlā vidadhataḥ svairam īśvarasya ātma māyayā	O wise Sūta, please narrate to us the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Godhead’s multi-incarnations. Such auspicious adventures and pastimes of the Lord, the supreme controller, are performed by His internal powers.
vayam tu na vitṛpyāmaḥ uttama śloka vikrame yat śṛṇvatām rasa jñānām svādu svādu pade pade	We never tire of hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, who is glorified by hymns and prayers. Those who have developed a taste for transcendental relationships with Him relish hearing of His pastimes at every moment.
kṛtavān kila karmāṇi saha rāmeṇa keśavaḥ atimartyāni bhagavān gūḍhaḥ kapaṭa mānuṣaḥ	Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, along with Balarāma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.
kalim āgatam ājñāya kṣetre asmin vaiṣṇave vayam āsīnāḥ dīrgha satreṇa kathāyām sa kṣaṇāḥ hareḥ	Knowing well that the Age of Kali has already begun, we are assembled here in this holy place to hear at great length the transcendental message of Godhead and in this way perform sacrifice.
tvam naḥ sandarśitaḥ dhātrā dustaram nistitīrṣatām kalim sattva haram puṁsām karṇa dhāraḥ iva arṇavam	We think that we have met Your Goodness by the will of providence, just so that we may accept you as captain of the ship for those who desire to cross the difficult ocean of Kali, which deteriorates all the good qualities of a human being.
brūhi yoga īśvare kṛṣṇe brahmaṇye dharma varmaṇi svām kāṣṭhām adhunā upete dharmaḥ kam śaraṇam gataḥ	Since Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Truth, the master of all mystic powers, has departed for His own abode, please tell us to whom the religious principles have now gone for shelter.
vyāsaḥ uvāca iti sampraśna saṁhṛṣṭaḥ viprāṇām raumaharṣaṇiḥ pratipūjya vacaḥ teṣām pravaktum upacakrame	Ugraśravā [Sūta Gosvāmī], the son of Romaharṣaṇa, being fully satisfied by the perfect questions of the brāhmaṇas, thanked them and thus attempted to reply.
sūtaḥ uvāca yam pravrajantam anupetam apeta kṛtyam dvaipāyanaḥ viraha kātaraḥ ājuhāva putra iti tat mayatayā taravaḥ abhineduḥ tam sarva bhūta hṛdayam munim ānataḥ asmi	Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī said: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that great sage [Śukadeva Gosvāmī] who can enter the hearts of all. When he went away to take up the renounced order of life [sannyāsa], leaving home without undergoing reformation by the sacred thread or the ceremonies observed by the higher castes, his father, Vyāsadeva, fearing separation from him, cried out, “O my son!” Indeed, only the trees, which were absorbed in the same feelings of separation, echoed in response to the begrieved father.
yaḥ sva anubhāvam akhila śruti sāram ekam adhyātma dīpam atititīrṣatām tamaḥ andham saṁsāriṇām karuṇayā āha purāṇa guhyam tam vyāsa sūnum upayāmi gurum munīnām	Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto him [Śuka], the spiritual master of all sages, the son of Vyāsadeva, who, out of his great compassion for those gross materialists who struggle to cross over the darkest regions of material existence, spoke this most confidential supplement to the cream of Vedic knowledge, after having personally assimilated it by experience.
nārāyaṇam namaḥ kṛtya naram ca eva nara uttamam devīm sarasvatīm vyāsam tataḥ jayam udīrayet	Before reciting this Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which is the very means of conquest, one should offer respectful obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, unto Nara-nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi, the supermost human being, unto mother Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning, and unto Śrīla Vyāsadeva, the author.
munayaḥ sādhu pṛṣṭaḥ aham bhavadbhiḥ loka maṅgalam yat kṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa sampraśnaḥ yena ātmā suprasīdati	O sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are worthy because they relate to Lord Kṛṣṇa and so are of relevance to the world’s welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely satisfying the self.
saḥ vai puṁsām paraḥ dharmaḥ yataḥ bhaktiḥ adhokṣaje ahaitukī apratihatā yayā ātmā suprasīdati	The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self.
vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti yogaḥ prayojitaḥ janayati āśu vairāgyam jñānam ca yat ahaitukam	By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.
dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsām viṣvaksena kathāsu yaḥ na utpādayet yadi ratim śramaḥ eva hi kevalam	The occupational activities a man performs according to his own position are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Personality of Godhead.
dharmasya hi āpavargyasya na arthaḥ arthāya upakalpate na arthasya dharma eka antasya kāmaḥ lābhāya hi smṛtaḥ	All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain. Furthermore, according to sages, one who is engaged in the ultimate occupational service should never use material gain to cultivate sense gratification.
kāmasya na indriya prītiḥ lābhaḥ jīveta yāvatā jīvasya tattva jijñāsā na arthaḥ yaḥ ca iha karmabhiḥ	Life’s desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life, or self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else should be the goal of one’s works.
vadanti tat tattva vidaḥ tattvam yat jñānam advayam brahma iti paramātmā iti bhagavān iti śabdyate	Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān.
tat śraddadhānāḥ munayaḥ jñāna vairāgya yuktayā paśyanti ātmani ca ātmānam bhaktyā śruta gṛhītayā	The seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge and detachment, realizes that Absolute Truth by rendering devotional service in terms of what he has heard from the Vedānta-śruti.
ataḥ pumbhiḥ dvija śreṣṭhāḥ varṇa āśrama vibhāgaśaḥ svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhiḥ hari toṣaṇam	O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by discharging the duties prescribed for one’s own occupation according to caste divisions and orders of life is to please the Personality of Godhead.
tasmāt ekena manasā bhagavān sātvatām patiḥ śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaḥ ca dhyeyaḥ pūjyaḥ ca nityadā	Therefore, with one-pointed attention, one should constantly hear about, glorify, remember and worship the Personality of Godhead, who is the protector of the devotees.
yat anudhyā asinā yuktāḥ karma granthi nibandhanam chindanti kovidāḥ tasya kaḥ na kuryāt kathā ratim	With sword in hand, intelligent men cut through the binding knots of reactionary work [karma] by remembering the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, who will not pay attention to His message?
śuśrūṣoḥ śraddadhānasya vāsudeva kathā ruciḥ syāt mahat sevayā viprāḥ puṇya tīrtha niṣevaṇāt	O twice-born sages, by serving those devotees who are completely freed from all vice, great service is done. By such service, one gains affinity for hearing the messages of Vāsudeva.
śṛṇvatām sva kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya śravaṇa kīrtanaḥ hṛdi antaḥ sthaḥ hi abhadrāṇi vidhunoti suhṛt satām	Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramātmā [Supersoul] in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.
naṣṭa prāyeṣu abhadreṣu nityam bhāgavata sevayā bhagavati uttama śloke bhaktiḥ bhavati naiṣṭhikī	By regular attendance in classes on the Bhāgavatam and by rendering of service to the pure devotee, all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed, and loving service unto the Personality of Godhead, who is praised with transcendental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact.
tadā rajaḥ tamaḥ bhāvāḥ kāma lobha ādayaḥ ca ye cetaḥ etaiḥ anāviddham sthitam sattve prasīdati	As soon as irrevocable loving service is established in the heart, the effects of nature’s modes of passion and ignorance, such as lust, desire and hankering, disappear from the heart. Then the devotee is established in goodness, and he becomes completely happy.
evam prasanna manasaḥ bhagavat bhakti yogataḥ bhagavat tattva vijñānam mukta saṅgasya jāyate	Thus established in the mode of unalloyed goodness, the man whose mind has been enlivened by contact with devotional service to the Lord gains positive scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead in the stage of liberation from all material association.
bhidyate hṛdaya granthiḥ chidyante sarva saṁśayāḥ kṣīyante ca asya karmāṇi dṛṣṭe eva ātmani īśvare	Thus the knot in the heart is pierced, and all misgivings are cut to pieces. The chain of fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the self as master.
ataḥ vai kavayaḥ nityam bhaktim paramayā mudā vāsudeve bhagavati kurvanti ātma prasādanīm	Certainly, therefore, since time immemorial, all transcendentalists have been rendering devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, with great delight, because such devotional service is enlivening to the self.
sattvam rajaḥ tamaḥ iti prakṛteḥ guṇāḥ taiḥ yuktaḥ paraḥ puruṣaḥ ekaḥ iha asya dhatte sthiti ādaye hari viriñci hara iti saṁjñāḥ śreyāṁsi tatra khalu sattva tanoḥ nṛṇām syuḥ	The transcendental Personality of Godhead is indirectly associated with the three modes of material nature, namely passion, goodness and ignorance, and just for the material world’s creation, maintenance and destruction He accepts the three qualitative forms of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. Of these three, all human beings can derive ultimate benefit from Viṣṇu, the form of the quality of goodness.
pārthivāt dāruṇaḥ dhūmaḥ tasmāt agniḥ trayī mayaḥ tamasaḥ tu rajaḥ tasmāt sattvam yat brahma darśanam	Firewood is a transformation of earth, but smoke is better than the raw wood. And fire is still better, for by fire we can derive the benefits of superior knowledge [through Vedic sacrifices]. Similarly, passion [rajas] is better than ignorance [tamas], but goodness [sattva] is best because by goodness one can come to realize the Absolute Truth.
bhejire munayaḥ atha agre bhagavantam adhokṣajam sattvam viśuddham kṣemāya kalpante ye anu tān iha	Previously all the great sages rendered service unto the Personality of Godhead due to His existence above the three modes of material nature. They worshiped Him to become free from material conditions and thus derive the ultimate benefit. Whoever follows such great authorities is also eligible for liberation from the material world.
mumukṣavaḥ ghora rūpān hitvā bhūta patīn atha nārāyaṇa kalāḥ śāntāḥ bhajanti hi anasūyavaḥ	Those who are serious about liberation are certainly nonenvious, and they respect all. Yet they reject the horrible and ghastly forms of the demigods and worship only the all-blissful forms of Lord Viṣṇu and His plenary portions.
rajaḥ tamaḥ prakṛtayaḥ sama śīlāḥ bhajanti vai pitṛ bhūta prajeśa ādīn śriyā aiśvarya prajā īpsavaḥ	Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance worship those in the same category — namely the forefathers, other living beings and the demigods who are in charge of cosmic activities — for they are urged by a desire to be materially benefited with women, wealth, power and progeny.
vāsudeva parāḥ vedāḥ vāsudeva parāḥ makhāḥ vāsudeva parāḥ yogāḥ vāsudeva parāḥ kriyāḥ vāsudeva param jñānam vāsudeva param tapaḥ vāsudeva paraḥ dharmaḥ vāsudeva parāḥ gatiḥ	In the revealed scriptures, the ultimate object of knowledge is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. The purpose of performing sacrifice is to please Him. Yoga is for realizing Him. All fruitive activities are ultimately rewarded by Him only. He is supreme knowledge, and all severe austerities are performed to know Him. Religion [dharma] is rendering loving service unto Him. He is the supreme goal of life.
saḥ eva idam sasarja agre bhagavān ātma māyayā sat asat rūpayā ca asau guṇa maya aguṇaḥ vibhuḥ	In the beginning of the material creation, that Absolute Personality of Godhead [Vāsudeva], in His transcendental position, created the energies of cause and effect by His own internal energy.
tayā vilasiteṣu eṣu guṇeṣu guṇavān iva antaḥ praviṣṭaḥ ābhāti vijñānena vijṛmbhitaḥ	After creating the material substance, the Lord [Vāsudeva] expands Himself and enters into it. And although He is within the material modes of nature and appears to be one of the created beings, He is always fully enlightened in His transcendental position.
yathā hi avahitaḥ vahniḥ dāruṣu ekaḥ sva yoniṣu nānā iva bhāti viśva ātmā bhūteṣu ca tathā pumān	The Lord, as Supersoul, pervades all things, just as fire permeates wood, and so He appears to be of many varieties, though He is the absolute one without a second.
asau guṇa mayaiḥ bhāvaiḥ bhūta sūkṣma indriya ātmabhiḥ sva nirmiteṣu nirviṣṭaḥ bhuṅkte bhūteṣu tat guṇān	The Supersoul enters into the bodies of the created beings who are influenced by the modes of material nature and causes them to enjoy the effects of these modes by the subtle mind.
bhāvayati eṣaḥ sattvena lokān vai loka bhāvanaḥ līlā avatāra anurataḥ deva tiryak nara ādiṣu	Thus the Lord of the universes maintains all planets inhabited by demigods, men and lower animals. Assuming the roles of incarnations, He performs pastimes to reclaim those in the mode of pure goodness.
sūtaḥ uvāca jagṛhe pauruṣam rūpam bhagavān mahat ādibhiḥ sambhūtam ṣoḍaśa kalam ādau loka sisṛkṣayā	Sūta said: In the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in the universal form of the puruṣa incarnation and manifested all the ingredients for the material creation. And thus at first there was the creation of the sixteen principles of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the material universes.
yasya ambhasi śayānasya yoga nidrām vitanvataḥ nābhi hrada ambujāt āsīt brahmā viśva sṛjām patiḥ	A part of the puruṣa lies down within the water of the universe, from the navel lake of His body sprouts a lotus stem, and from the lotus flower atop this stem, Brahmā, the master of all engineers in the universe, becomes manifest.
yasya avayava saṁsthānaiḥ kalpitaḥ loka vistaraḥ tat vai bhagavataḥ rūpam viśuddham sattvam ūrjitam	It is believed that all the universal planetary systems are situated on the extensive body of the puruṣa, but He has nothing to do with the created material ingredients. His body is eternally in spiritual existence par excellence.
paśyanti adaḥ rūpam adabhra cakṣuṣā sahasra pāda ūru bhuja ānana adbhutam sahasra mūrdha śravaṇa akṣi nāsikam sahasra mauli ambara kuṇḍala ullasat	The devotees, with their perfect eyes, see the transcendental form of the puruṣa who has thousands of legs, thighs, arms and faces — all extraordinary. In that body there are thousands of heads, ears, eyes and noses. They are decorated with thousands of helmets and glowing earrings and are adorned with garlands.
etat nānā avatārāṇām nidhānam bījam avyayam yasya aṁśa aṁśena sṛjyante deva tiryak nara ādayaḥ	This form [the second manifestation of the puruṣa] is the source and indestructible seed of multifarious incarnations within the universe. From the particles and portions of this form, different living entities, like demigods, men and others, are created.
saḥ eva prathamam devaḥ kaumāram sargam āśritaḥ cacāra duścaram brahmā brahmacaryam akhaṇḍitam	First of all, in the beginning of creation, there were the four unmarried sons of Brahmā [the Kumāras], who, being situated in a vow of celibacy, underwent severe austerities for realization of the Absolute Truth.
dvitīyam tu bhavāya asya rasātala gatām mahīm uddhariṣyan upādatta yajñeśaḥ saukaram vapuḥ	The supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices accepted the incarnation of a boar [the second incarnation], and for the welfare of the earth He lifted the earth from the nether regions of the universe.
tṛtīyam ṛṣi sargam vai devarṣitvam upetya saḥ tantram sātvatam ācaṣṭa naiṣkarmyam karmaṇām yataḥ	In the millennium of the ṛṣis, the Personality of Godhead accepted the third empowered incarnation in the form of Devarṣi Nārada, who is a great sage among the demigods. He collected expositions of the Vedas which deal with devotional service and which inspire nonfruitive action.
turye dharma kalā sarge nara nārāyaṇau ṛṣī bhūtvā ātma upaśama upetam akarot duścaram tapaḥ	In the fourth incarnation, the Lord became Nara and Nārāyaṇa, the twin sons of the wife of King Dharma. Thus He undertook severe and exemplary penances to control the senses.
pañcamaḥ kapilaḥ nāma siddheśaḥ kāla viplutam provāca āsuraye sāṅkhyam tattva grāma vinirṇayam	The fifth incarnation, named Lord Kapila, is foremost among perfected beings. He gave an exposition of the creative elements and metaphysics to Āsuri Brāhmaṇa, for in course of time this knowledge had been lost.
ṣaṣṭham atreḥ apatyatvam vṛtaḥ prāptaḥ anasūyayā ānvīkṣikīm alarkāya prahlāda ādibhyaḥ ūcivān	The sixth incarnation of the puruṣa was the son of the sage Atri. He was born from the womb of Anasūyā, who prayed for an incarnation. He spoke on the subject of transcendence to Alarka, Prahlāda and others [Yadu, Haihaya, etc.].
tataḥ saptame ākūtyām ruceḥ yajñaḥ abhyajāyata saḥ yāma ādyaiḥ sura gaṇaiḥ apāt svāyambhuva antaram	The seventh incarnation was Yajña, the son of Prajāpati Ruci and his wife Ākūti. He controlled the period during the change of the Svāyambhuva Manu and was assisted by demigods such as His son Yāma.

ṛṣibhiḥ yācitaḥ bheje navamam pārthivam vapuḥ dugdha imām oṣadhīḥ viprāḥ tena ayam saḥ uśattamaḥ	O brāhmaṇas, in the ninth incarnation, the Lord, prayed for by sages, accepted the body of a king [Pṛthu] who cultivated the land to yield various produce, and for that reason the earth was beautiful and attractive.
rūpam saḥ jagṛhe mātsyam cākṣuṣa udadhi samplave nāvi āropya mahī mayyām apāt vaivasvatam manum	When there was a complete inundation after the period of the Cākṣuṣa Manu and the whole world was deep within water, the Lord accepted the form of a fish and protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him up on a boat.
sura asurāṇām udadhim mathnatām mandarācalam dadhre kamaṭha rūpeṇa pṛṣṭhe ekādaśe vibhuḥ	The eleventh incarnation of the Lord took the form of a tortoise whose shell served as a pivot for the Mandarācala Hill, which was being used as a churning rod by the theists and atheists of the universe.
dhānvantaram dvādaśamam trayodaśamam eva ca apāyayat surān anyān mohinyā mohayan striyā	In the twelfth incarnation, the Lord appeared as Dhanvantari, and in the thirteenth He allured the atheists by the charming beauty of a woman and gave nectar to the demigods to drink.
caturdaśam nāra siṁham bibhrat daitya indram ūrjitam dadāra karajaiḥ ūrau erakām kaṭa kṛt yathā	In the fourteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as Nṛsiṁha and bifurcated the strong body of the atheist Hiraṇyakaśipu with His nails, just as a carpenter pierces cane.
pañcadaśam vāmanakam kṛtvā agāt adhvaram baleḥ pada trayam yācamānaḥ pratyāditsuḥ tri piṣṭapam	In the fifteenth incarnation, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf brāhmaṇa [Vāmana] and visited the arena of sacrifice arranged by Mahārāja Bali. Although at heart He was willing to regain the kingdom of the three planetary systems, He simply asked for a donation of three steps of land.
avatāre ṣoḍaśame paśyan brahma druhaḥ nṛpān triḥ sapta kṛtvaḥ kupitaḥ niḥ kṣatrām akarot mahīm	In the sixteenth incarnation of the Godhead, the Lord [as Bhṛgupati] annihilated the administrative class [kṣatriyas] twenty-one times, being angry with them because of their rebellion against the brāhmaṇas [the intelligent class].
tataḥ saptadaśe jātaḥ satyavatyām parāśarāt cakre veda taroḥ śākhāḥ dṛṣṭvā puṁsaḥ alpa medhasaḥ	Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Śrī Vyāsadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavatī through Parāśara Muni, and he divided the one Veda into several branches and subbranches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.
nara devatvam āpannaḥ sura kārya cikīrṣayā samudra nigraha ādīni cakre vīryāṇi ataḥ param	In the eighteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as King Rāma. In order to perform some pleasing work for the demigods, He exhibited superhuman powers by controlling the Indian Ocean and then killing the atheist King Rāvaṇa, who was on the other side of the sea.
ekonaviṁśe viṁśatime vṛṣṇiṣu prāpya janmanī rāma kṛṣṇau iti bhuvaḥ bhagavān aharat bharam	In the nineteenth and twentieth incarnations, the Lord advented Himself as Lord Balarāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa in the family of Vṛṣṇi [the Yadu dynasty], and by so doing He removed the burden of the world.
tataḥ kalau sampravṛtte sammohāya sura dviṣām buddhaḥ nāmnā añjana sutaḥ kīkaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati	Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.
atha asau yuga sandhyāyām dasyu prāyeṣu rājasu janitā viṣṇu yaśasaḥ nāmnā kalkiḥ jagat patiḥ	Thereafter, at the conjunction of two yugas, the Lord of the creation will take His birth as the Kalki incarnation and become the son of Viṣṇu Yaśā. At this time almost all the rulers of the earth will have degenerated into plunderers.
avatārāḥ hi asaṅkhyeyāḥ hareḥ sattva nidheḥ dvijāḥ yathā avidāsinaḥ kulyāḥ sarasaḥ syuḥ sahasraśaḥ	O brāhmaṇas, the incarnations of the Lord are innumerable, like rivulets flowing from inexhaustible sources of water.
ṛṣayaḥ manavaḥ devāḥ manu putrāḥ mahā ojasaḥ kalāḥ sarve hareḥ eva sa prajāpatayaḥ smṛtāḥ	All the ṛṣis, Manus, demigods and descendants of Manu, who are especially powerful, are plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord. This also includes the Prajāpatis.
ete ca aṁśa kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ tu bhagavān svayam indra ari vyākulam lokam mṛḍayanti yuge yuge	All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord, but Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists.
janma guhyam bhagavataḥ yaḥ etat prayataḥ naraḥ sāyam prātaḥ gṛṇan bhaktyā duḥkha grāmāt vimucyate	Whoever carefully recites the mysterious appearances of the Lord, with devotion in the morning and in the evening, gets relief from all miseries of life.
etat rūpam bhagavataḥ hi arūpasya cit ātmanaḥ māyā guṇaiḥ viracitam mahat ādibhiḥ ātmani	The conception of the virāṭ universal form of the Lord, as appearing in the material world, is imaginary. It is to enable the less intelligent [and neophytes] to adjust to the idea of the Lord’s having form. But factually the Lord has no material form.
yathā nabhasi megha oghaḥ reṇuḥ vā pārthivaḥ anile evam draṣṭari dṛśyatvam āropitam abuddhibhiḥ	Clouds and dust are carried by the air, but less intelligent persons say that the sky is cloudy and the air is dirty. Similarly, they also implant material bodily conceptions on the spirit self.
ataḥ param yat avyaktam avyūḍha guṇa bṛṁhitam adṛṣṭa aśruta vastutvāt saḥ jīvaḥ yat punaḥ bhavaḥ	Beyond this gross conception of form is another, subtle conception of form which is without formal shape and is unseen, unheard and unmanifest. The living being has his form beyond this subtlety, otherwise he could not have repeated births.
yatra ime sat asat rūpe pratiṣiddhe sva saṁvidā avidyayā ātmani kṛte iti tat brahma darśanam	Whenever a person experiences, by self-realization, that both the gross and subtle bodies have nothing to do with the pure self, at that time he sees himself as well as the Lord.
yadi eṣā uparatā devī māyā vaiśāradī matiḥ sampannaḥ eva iti viduḥ mahimni sve mahīyate	If the illusory energy subsides and the living entity becomes fully enriched with knowledge by the grace of the Lord, then he becomes at once enlightened with self-realization and thus becomes situated in his own glory.
evam janmāni karmāṇi hi akartuḥ ajanasya ca varṇayanti sma kavayaḥ veda guhyāni hṛt pateḥ	Thus learned men describe the births and activities of the unborn and inactive, which is undiscoverable even in the Vedic literatures. He is the Lord of the heart.
saḥ vā idam viśvam amogha līlaḥ sṛjati avati atti na sajjate asmin bhūteṣu ca antarhitaḥ ātma tantraḥ ṣāṭ vargikam jighrati ṣaṭ guṇa īśaḥ	The Lord, whose activities are always spotless, is the master of the six senses and is fully omnipotent with six opulences. He creates the manifested universes, maintains them and annihilates them without being in the least affected. He is within every living being and is always independent.
na ca asya kaścit nipuṇena dhātuḥ avaiti jantuḥ kumanīṣaḥ ūtīḥ nāmāni rūpāṇi manaḥ vacobhiḥ santanvataḥ naṭa caryām iva ajñaḥ	The foolish with a poor fund of knowledge cannot know the transcendental nature of the forms, names and activities of the Lord, who is playing like an actor in a drama. Nor can they express such things, neither in their speculations nor in their words.
saḥ veda dhātuḥ padavīm parasya duranta vīryasya ratha aṅga pāṇeḥ yaḥ amāyayā santatayā anuvṛttyā bhajeta tat pāda saroja gandham	Only those who render unreserved, uninterrupted, favorable service unto the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who carries the wheel of the chariot in His hand, can know the creator of the universe in His full glory, power and transcendence.
atha iha dhanyāḥ bhagavantaḥ ittham yat vāsudeve akhila loka nāthe kurvanti sarva ātmakam ātma bhāvam na yatra bhūyaḥ parivartaḥ ugraḥ	Only by making such inquiries in this world can one be successful and perfectly cognizant, for such inquiries invoke transcendental ecstatic love unto the Personality of Godhead, who is the proprietor of all the universes, and guarantee cent-percent immunity from the dreadful repetition of birth and death.
idam bhāgavatam nāma purāṇam brahma sammitam uttama śloka caritam cakāra bhagavān ṛṣiḥ niḥśreyasāya lokasya dhanyam svasti ayanam mahat	This Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the literary incarnation of God, and it is compiled by Śrīla Vyāsadeva, the incarnation of God. It is meant for the ultimate good of all people, and it is all-successful, all-blissful and all-perfect.
tat idam grāhayām āsa sutam ātmavatām varam sarva veda itihāsānām sāram sāram samuddhṛtam	Śrī Vyāsadeva delivered it to his son, who is the most respected among the self-realized, after extracting the cream of all Vedic literatures and histories of the universe.
saḥ tu saṁśrāvayām āsa mahā rājam parīkṣitam prāya upaviṣṭam gaṅgāyām parītam parama ṛṣibhiḥ	Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of Vyāsadeva, in his turn delivered the Bhāgavatam to the great Emperor Parīkṣit, who sat surrounded by sages on the bank of the Ganges, awaiting death without taking food or drink.
kṛṣṇe sva dhāma upagate dharma jñāna ādibhiḥ saha kalau naṣṭa dṛśām eṣaḥ purāṇa arkaḥ adhunā uditaḥ	This Bhāgavata Purāṇa is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen just after the departure of Lord Kṛṣṇa to His own abode, accompanied by religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the dense darkness of ignorance in the Age of Kali shall get light from this Purāṇa.
tatra kīrtayataḥ viprāḥ vipra ṛṣeḥ bhūri tejasaḥ aham ca adhyagamam tatra niviṣṭaḥ tat anugrahāt saḥ aham vaḥ śrāvayiṣyāmi yathā adhītam yathā mati	O learned brāhmaṇas, when Śukadeva Gosvāmī recited Bhāgavatam there [in the presence of Emperor Parīkṣit], I heard him with rapt attention, and thus, by his mercy, I learned the Bhāgavatam from that great and powerful sage. Now I shall try to make you hear the very same thing as I learned it from him and as I have realized it.
vyāsaḥ uvāca iti bruvāṇam saṁstūya munīnām dīrgha satriṇām vṛddhaḥ kula patiḥ sūtam bahu ṛcaḥ śaunakaḥ abravīt	Vyāsadeva said: On hearing Sūta Gosvāmī speak thus, Śaunaka Muni, who was the elderly, learned leader of all the ṛṣis engaged in that prolonged sacrificial ceremony, congratulated Sūta Gosvāmī by addressing him as follows.
śaunakaḥ uvāca sūta sūta mahā bhāga vada naḥ vadatām vara kathām bhāgavatīm puṇyām yat āha bhagavān śukaḥ	Śaunaka said: O Sūta Gosvāmī, you are the most fortunate and respected of all those who can speak and recite. Please relate the pious message of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which was spoken by the great and powerful sage Śukadeva Gosvāmī.
kasmin yuge pravṛttā iyam sthāne vā kena hetunā kutaḥ sañcoditaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ kṛtavān saṁhitām muniḥ	In what period and at what place was this first begun, and why was this taken up? From where did Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana Vyāsa, the great sage, get the inspiration to compile this literature?
tasya putraḥ mahā yogī sama dṛk nirvikalpakaḥ ekānta matiḥ unnidraḥ gūḍhaḥ mūḍhaḥ iva īyate	His [Vyāsadeva’s] son was a great devotee, an equibalanced monist, whose mind was always concentrated in monism. He was transcendental to mundane activities, but being unexposed, he appeared like an ignorant person.
dṛṣṭvā anuyāntam ṛṣim ātmajam api anagnam devyaḥ hriyā paridadhuḥ na sutasya citram tat vīkṣya pṛcchati munau jagaduḥ tava asti strī pum bhidā na tu sutasya vivikta dṛṣṭeḥ	While Śrī Vyāsadeva was following his son, beautiful young damsels who were bathing naked covered their bodies with cloth, although Śrī Vyāsadeva himself was not naked. But they had not done so when his son had passed. The sage inquired about this, and the young ladies replied that his son was purified and when looking at them made no distinction between male and female. But the sage made such distinctions.
katham ālakṣitaḥ pauraiḥ samprāptaḥ kuru jāṅgalān unmatta mūka jaḍavat vicaran gaja sāhvaye	How was he [Śrīla Śukadeva, the son of Vyāsa] recognized by the citizens when he entered the city of Hastināpura [now Delhi], after wandering in the provinces of Kuru and Jāṅgala, appearing like a madman, dumb and retarded?
katham vā pāṇḍaveyasya rājarṣeḥ muninā saha saṁvādaḥ samabhūt tāta yatra eṣā sātvatī śrutiḥ	How did it so happen that King Parīkṣit met this great sage, making it possible for this great transcendental essence of the Vedas [Bhāgavatam] to be sung to him?
saḥ go dohana mātram hi gṛheṣu gṛha medhinām avekṣate mahā bhāgaḥ tīrthī kurvan tat āśramam	He [Śukadeva Gosvāmī] was accustomed to stay at the door of a householder only long enough for a cow to be milked. And he did this just to sanctify the residence.
abhimanyu sutam sūta prāhuḥ bhāgavata uttamam tasya janma mahā āścaryam karmāṇi ca gṛṇīhi naḥ	It is said that Mahārāja Parīkṣit is a great first-class devotee of the Lord and that his birth and activities are all wonderful. Please tell us about him.
saḥ samrāṭ kasya vā hetoḥ pāṇḍūnām māna vardhanaḥ prāya upaviṣṭaḥ gaṅgāyām anādṛtya adhirāṭ śriyam	He was a great emperor and possessed all the opulences of his acquired kingdom. He was so exalted that he was increasing the prestige of the Pāṇḍu dynasty. Why did he give up everything to sit down on the bank of the Ganges and fast until death?
namanti yat pāda niketam ātmanaḥ śivāya hānīya dhanāni śatravaḥ katham saḥ vīraḥ śriyam aṅga dustyajām yuvā aiṣata utsraṣṭum aho saha asubhiḥ	He was such a great emperor that all his enemies would come and bow down at his feet and surrender all their wealth for their own benefit. He was full of youth and strength, and he possessed kingly opulences that were difficult to give up. Why did he want to give up everything, including his life?
śivāya lokasya bhavāya bhūtaye ye uttama śloka parāyaṇāḥ janāḥ jīvanti na ātma artham asau para āśrayam mumoca nirvidya kutaḥ kalevaram	Those who are devoted to the cause of the Personality of Godhead live only for the welfare, development and happiness of others. They do not live for any selfish interest. So even though the Emperor [Parīkṣit] was free from all attachment to worldly possessions, how could he give up his mortal body, which was the shelter for others?
tat sarvam naḥ samācakṣva pṛṣṭaḥ yat iha kiñcana manye tvām viṣaye vācām snātam anyatra chāndasāt	We know that you are expert in the meaning of all subjects, except some portions of the Vedas, and thus you can clearly explain the answers to all the questions we have just put to you.
sūtaḥ uvāca dvāpare samanuprāpte tṛtīye yuga paryaye jātaḥ parāśarāt yogī vāsavyām kalayā hareḥ	Sūta Gosvāmī said: When the second millennium overlapped the third, the great sage [Vyāsadeva] was born to Parāśara in the womb of Satyavatī, the daughter of Vasu.
saḥ kadācit sarasvatyāḥ upaspṛśya jalam śuciḥ vivikte ekaḥ āsīnaḥ udite ravi maṇḍale	Once upon a time he [Vyāsadeva], as the sun rose, took his morning ablution in the waters of the Sarasvatī and sat alone to concentrate.
para avara jñaḥ saḥ ṛṣiḥ kālena avyakta raṁhasā yuga dharma vyatikaram prāptam bhuvi yuge yuge	The great sage Vyāsadeva saw anomalies in the duties of the millennium. This happens on the earth in different ages, due to the unseen force of time.
bhautikānām ca bhāvānām śakti hrāsam ca tat kṛtam aśraddadhānān niḥsattvān durmedhān hrasita āyuṣaḥ durbhagān ca janān vīkṣya muniḥ divyena cakṣuṣā sarva varṇa āśramāṇām yat dadhyau hitam amogha dṛk	The great sage, who was fully equipped in knowledge, could see through his transcendental vision the deterioration of everything material due to the influence of the age. He could also see that the faithless people in general would be reduced in duration of life and would be impatient due to lack of goodness. Thus he contemplated for the welfare of men in all statuses and orders of life.
cātuḥ hotram karma śuddham prajānām vīkṣya vaidikam vyadadhāt yajña santatyai vedam ekam catuḥ vidham	He saw that the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas were means by which the people’s occupations could be purified. And to simplify the process he divided the one Veda into four, in order to expand them among men.
ṛg yajuḥ sāma atharva ākhyāḥ vedāḥ catvāraḥ uddhṛtāḥ itihāsa purāṇam ca pañcamaḥ vedaḥ ucyate	The four divisions of the original sources of knowledge [the Vedas] were made separately. But the historical facts and authentic stories mentioned in the Purāṇas are called the fifth Veda.
tatra ṛg veda dharaḥ pailaḥ sāma gaḥ jaiminiḥ kaviḥ vaiśampāyanaḥ eva ekaḥ niṣṇātaḥ yajuṣām uta	After the Vedas were divided into four divisions, Paila Ṛṣi became the professor of the Ṛg Veda, Jaimini the professor of the Sāma Veda, and Vaiśampāyana alone became glorified by the Yajur Veda.
atharva aṅgirasām āsīt sumantuḥ dāruṇaḥ muniḥ itihāsa purāṇānām pitā me romaharṣaṇaḥ	The Sumantu Muni Aṅgirā, who was very devotedly engaged, was entrusted with the Atharva Veda. And my father, Romaharṣaṇa, was entrusted with the Purāṇas and historical records.
te ete ṛṣayaḥ vedam svam svam vyasyan anekadhā śiṣyaiḥ praśiṣyaiḥ tat śiṣyaiḥ vedāḥ te śākhinaḥ abhavan	All these learned scholars, in their turn, rendered their entrusted Vedas unto their many disciples, granddisciples and great-granddisciples, and thus the respective branches of the followers of the Vedas came into being.
te eva vedāḥ durmedhaiḥ dhāryante puruṣaiḥ yathā evam cakāra bhagavān vyāsaḥ kṛpaṇa vatsalaḥ	Thus the great sage Vyāsadeva, who is very kind to the ignorant masses, edited the Vedas so they might be assimilated by less intellectual men.
strī śūdra dvija bandhūnām trayī na śruti gocarā karma śreyasi mūḍhānām śreyaḥ evam bhavet iha iti bhāratam ākhyānam kṛpayā muninā kṛtam	Out of compassion, the great sage thought it wise that this would enable men to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Thus he compiled the great historical narration called the Mahābhārata for women, laborers and friends of the twice-born.
evam pravṛttasya sadā bhūtānām śreyasi dvijāḥ sarvātmakena api yadā na atuṣyat hṛdayam tataḥ	O twice-born brāhmaṇas, still his mind was not satisfied, although he engaged himself in working for the total welfare of all people.
na atiprasīdat hṛdayaḥ sarasvatyāḥ taṭe śucau vitarkayan vivikta sthaḥ idam ca uvāca dharma vit	Thus the sage, being dissatisfied at heart, at once began to reflect, because he knew the essence of religion, and he said within himself:
dhṛta vratena hi mayā chandāṁsi guravaḥ agnayaḥ mānitāḥ nirvyalīkena gṛhītam ca anuśāsanam bhārata vyapadeśena hi āmnāya arthaḥ ca pradarśitaḥ dṛśyate yatra dharma ādiḥ strī śūdra ādibhiḥ api uta	I have, under strict disciplinary vows, unpretentiously worshiped the Vedas, the spiritual masters and the altar of sacrifice. I have also abided by the rulings and have shown the import of disciplic succession through the explanation of the Mahābhārata, by which even women, śūdras and others [friends of the twice-born] can see the path of religion.
tathāpi bata me daihyaḥ hi ātmā ca eva ātmanā vibhuḥ asampannaḥ iva ābhāti brahma varcasya sattamaḥ	I am feeling incomplete, though I myself am fully equipped with everything required by the Vedas.
kim vā bhāgavatāḥ dharmāḥ na prāyeṇa nirūpitāḥ priyāḥ paramahaṁsānām te eva hi acyuta priyāḥ	This may be because I did not specifically point out the devotional service of the Lord, which is dear both to perfect beings and to the infallible Lord.
tasya evam khilam ātmānam manyamānasya khidyataḥ kṛṣṇasya nāradaḥ abhyāgāt āśramam prāk udāhṛtam	As mentioned before, Nārada reached the cottage of Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana Vyāsa on the banks of the Sarasvatī just as Vyāsadeva was regretting his defects.
tam abhijñāya sahasā pratyutthāya āgatam muniḥ pūjayām āsa vidhi vat nāradam sura pūjitam	At the auspicious arrival of Śrī Nārada, Śrī Vyāsadeva got up respectfully and worshiped him, giving him veneration equal to that given to Brahmājī, the creator.
sūtaḥ uvāca atha tam sukham āsīnaḥ upāsīnam bṛhat śravāḥ devarṣiḥ prāha viprarṣim vīṇā pāṇiḥ smayan iva	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Thus the sage amongst the gods [Nārada], comfortably seated and apparently smiling, addressed the ṛṣi amongst the brāhmaṇas [Vedavyāsa].
nāradaḥ uvāca pārāśarya mahā bhāga bhavataḥ kaccit ātmanā parituṣyati śārīraḥ ātmā mānasaḥ eva vā	Addressing Vyāsadeva, the son of Parāśara, Nārada inquired: Are you satisfied by identifying with the body or the mind as objects of self-realization?
jijñāsitam susampannam api te mahat adbhutam kṛtavān bhāratam yaḥ tvam sarva artha paribṛṁhitam	Your inquiries were full and your studies were also well fulfilled, and there is no doubt that you have prepared a great and wonderful work, the Mahābhārata, which is full of all kinds of Vedic sequences elaborately explained.
jijñāsitam adhītam ca brahma yat tat sanātanam tathāpi śocasi ātmānam akṛta arthaḥ iva prabho	You have fully delineated the subject of impersonal Brahman as well as the knowledge derived therefrom. Why should you be despondent in spite of all this, thinking that you are undone, my dear prabhu?
vyāsaḥ uvāca asti eva me sarvam idam tvayā uktam tathāpi na ātmā parituṣyate me tat mūlam avyaktam agādha bodham pṛcchāmahe tvā ātma bhava ātma bhūtam	Śrī Vyāsadeva said: All you have said about me is perfectly correct. Despite all this, I am not pacified. I therefore question you about the root cause of my dissatisfaction, for you are a man of unlimited knowledge due to your being the offspring of one [Brahmā] who is self-born [without mundane father and mother].
saḥ vai bhavān veda samasta guhyam upāsitaḥ yat puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ para avara īśaḥ manasā eva viśvam sṛjati avati atti guṇaiḥ asaṅgaḥ	My lord! Everything that is mysterious is known to you because you worship the creator and destroyer of the material world and the maintainer of the spiritual world, the original Personality of Godhead, who is transcendental to the three modes of material nature.
tvam paryaṭan arkaḥ iva tri lokīm antaḥ caraḥ vāyuḥ iva ātma sākṣī para avare brahmaṇi dharmataḥ vrataiḥ snātasya me nyūnam alam vicakṣva	Like the sun, Your Goodness can travel everywhere in the three worlds, and like the air you can penetrate the internal region of everyone. As such, you are as good as the all-pervasive Supersoul. Please, therefore, find out the deficiency in me, despite my being absorbed in transcendence under disciplinary regulations and vows.
śrī nāradaḥ uvāca bhavatā anudita prāyam yaśaḥ bhagavataḥ amalam yena eva asau na tuṣyeta manye tat darśanam khilam	Śrī Nārada said: You have not actually broadcast the sublime and spotless glories of the Personality of Godhead. That philosophy which does not satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord is considered worthless.
yathā dharma ādayaḥ ca arthāḥ muni varya anukīrtitāḥ na tathā vāsudevasya mahimā hi anuvarṇitaḥ	Although, great sage, you have very broadly described the four principles beginning with religious performances, you have not described the glories of the Supreme Personality, Vāsudeva.
na yat vacaḥ citra padam hareḥ yaśaḥ jagat pavitram pragṛṇīta karhicit tat vāyasam tīrtham uśanti mānasāḥ na yatra haṁsāḥ niramanti uśik kṣayāḥ	Those words which do not describe the glories of the Lord, who alone can sanctify the atmosphere of the whole universe, are considered by saintly persons to be like unto a place of pilgrimage for crows. Since the all-perfect persons are inhabitants of the transcendental abode, they do not derive any pleasure there.
tat vāk visargaḥ janatā agha viplavaḥ yasmin prati ślokam abaddhavati api nāmāni anantasya yaśaḥ aṅkitāni yat śṛṇvanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ	On the other hand, that literature which is full of descriptions of the transcendental glories of the name, fame, forms, pastimes, etc., of the unlimited Supreme Lord is a different creation, full of transcendental words directed toward bringing about a revolution in the impious lives of this world’s misdirected civilization. Such transcendental literatures, even though imperfectly composed, are heard, sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.
naiṣkarmyam api acyuta bhāva varjitam na śobhate jñānam alam nirañjanam kutaḥ punaḥ śaśvat abhadram īśvare na ca arpitam karma yat api akāraṇam	Knowledge of self-realization, even though free from all material affinity, does not look well if devoid of a conception of the Infallible [God]. What, then, is the use of fruitive activities, which are naturally painful from the very beginning and transient by nature, if they are not utilized for the devotional service of the Lord?
atho mahā bhāga bhavān amogha dṛk śuci śravāḥ satya rataḥ dhṛta vrataḥ urukramasya akhila bandha muktaye samādhinā anusmara tat viceṣṭitam	O Vyāsadeva, your vision is completely perfect. Your good fame is spotless. You are firm in vow and situated in truthfulness. And thus you can think of the pastimes of the Lord in trance for the liberation of the people in general from all material bondage.
tataḥ anyathā kiñcana yat vivakṣataḥ pṛthak dṛśaḥ tat kṛta rūpa nāmabhiḥ na karhicit kvāpi ca duḥsthitā matiḥ labheta vāta āhata nauḥ iva āspadam	Whatever you desire to describe that is separate in vision from the Lord simply reacts, with different forms, names and results, to agitate the mind, as the wind agitates a boat which has no resting place.
jugupsitam dharma kṛte anuśāsataḥ svabhāva raktasya mahān vyatikramaḥ yat vākyataḥ dharmaḥ iti itaraḥ sthitaḥ na manyate tasya nivāraṇam janaḥ	The people in general are naturally inclined to enjoy, and you have encouraged them in that way in the name of religion. This is verily condemned and is quite unreasonable. Because they are guided under your instructions, they will accept such activities in the name of religion and will hardly care for prohibitions.
vicakṣaṇaḥ asya arhati veditum vibhoḥ ananta pārasya nivṛttitaḥ sukham pravartamānasya guṇaiḥ anātmanaḥ tataḥ bhavān darśaya ceṣṭitam vibhoḥ	The Supreme Lord is unlimited. Only a very expert personality, retired from the activities of material happiness, deserves to understand this knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore those who are not so well situated, due to material attachment, should be shown the ways of transcendental realization, by Your Goodness, through descriptions of the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord.
tyaktvā sva dharmam caraṇa ambujam hareḥ bhajan apakvaḥ atha patet tataḥ yadi yatra kva vā abhadram abhūt amuṣya kim kaḥ vā arthaḥ āptaḥ abhajatām sva dharmataḥ	One who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything.
tasya eva hetoḥ prayateta kovidaḥ na labhyate yat bhramatām upari adhaḥ tat labhyate duḥkhavat anyataḥ sukham kālena sarvatra gabhīra raṁhasā	Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest planet [Pātāla]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.
na vai janaḥ jātu kathañcana āvrajet mukunda sevī anyavat aṅga saṁsṛtim smaran mukunda aṅghri upagūhanam punaḥ vihātum icchet na rasa grahaḥ janaḥ	My dear Vyāsa, even though a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa sometimes falls down somehow or other, he certainly does not undergo material existence like others [fruitive workers, etc.] because a person who has once relished the taste of the lotus feet of the Lord can do nothing but remember that ecstasy again and again.
idam hi viśvam bhagavān iva itaraḥ yataḥ jagat sthāna nirodha sambhavāḥ tat hi svayam veda bhavān tathā api te prādeśa mātram bhavataḥ pradarśitam	The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is Himself this cosmos, and still He is aloof from it. From Him only has this cosmic manifestation emanated, in Him it rests, and unto Him it enters after annihilation. Your good self knows all about this. I have given only a synopsis.
tvam ātmanā ātmānam avehi amogha dṛk parasya puṁsaḥ paramātmanaḥ kalām ajam prajātam jagataḥ śivāya tat mahā anubhāva abhyudayaḥ adhigaṇya tām	Your Goodness has perfect vision. You yourself can know the Supersoul Personality of Godhead because you are present as the plenary portion of the Lord. Although you are birthless, you have appeared on this earth for the well-being of all people. Please, therefore, describe the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa more vividly.
idam hi puṁsaḥ tapasaḥ śrutasya vā sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi dattayoḥ avicyutaḥ arthaḥ kavibhiḥ nirūpitaḥ yat uttamaśloka guṇa anuvarṇanam	Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, namely austerities, study of the Vedas, sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminates in the transcendental descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.
aham purā atīta bhave abhavam mune dāsyāḥ tu kasyāścana veda vādinām nirūpitaḥ bālakaḥ eva yoginām śuśrūṣaṇe prāvṛṣi nirvivikṣatām	O Muni, in the last millennium I was born as the son of a certain maidservant engaged in the service of brāhmaṇas who were following the principles of Vedānta. When they were living together during the four months of the rainy season, I was engaged in their personal service.
te mayi apeta akhila cāpale arbhake dānte adhṛta krīḍanake anuvartini cakruḥ kṛpām yadyapi tulya darśanāḥ śuśrūṣamāṇe munayaḥ alpa bhāṣiṇi	Although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the Vedānta blessed me with their causeless mercy. As far as I was concerned, I was self-controlled and had no attachment for sports, even though I was a boy. In addition, I was not naughty, and I did not speak more than required.
ucchiṣṭa lepān anumoditaḥ dvijaiḥ sakṛt sma bhuñje tat apāsta kilbiṣaḥ evam pravṛttasya viśuddha cetasaḥ tat dharmaḥ eva ātma ruciḥ prajāyate	Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me.
tatra anu aham kṛṣṇa kathāḥ pragāyatām anugraheṇa aśṛṇavam manaḥ harāḥ tāḥ śraddhayā me anupadam viśṛṇvataḥ priyaśravasi aṅga mama abhavat ruciḥ	O Vyāsadeva, in that association and by the mercy of those great Vedāntists, I could hear them describe the attractive activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa. And thus listening attentively, my taste for hearing of the Personality of Godhead increased at every step.
tasmin tadā labdha ruceḥ mahā mate priyaśravasi askhalitā matiḥ mama yayā aham etat sat asat sva māyayā paśye mayi brahmaṇi kalpitam pare	O great sage, as soon as I got a taste of the Personality of Godhead, my attention to hear of the Lord was unflinching. And as my taste developed, I could realize that it was only in my ignorance that I had accepted gross and subtle coverings, for both the Lord and I are transcendental.
ittham śarat prāvṛṣikau ṛtū hareḥ viśṛṇvataḥ me anusavam yaśaḥ amalam saṅkīrtyamānam munibhiḥ mahā ātmabhiḥ bhaktiḥ pravṛttā ātma rajaḥ tama upahā	Thus during two seasons — the rainy season and autumn — I had the opportunity to hear these great-souled sages constantly chant the unadulterated glories of the Lord Hari. As the flow of my devotional service began, the coverings of the modes of passion and ignorance vanished.
tasya evam me anuraktasya praśritasya hata enasaḥ śraddadhānasya bālasya dāntasya anucarasya ca	I was very much attached to those sages. I was gentle in behavior, and all my sins were eradicated in their service. In my heart I had strong faith in them. I had subjugated the senses, and I was strictly following them with body and mind.
jñānam guhyatamam yat tat sākṣāt bhagavatā uditam anvavocan gamiṣyantaḥ kṛpayā dīna vatsalāḥ	As they were leaving, those bhakti-vedāntas, who are very kind to poor-hearted souls, instructed me in that most confidential subject which is instructed by the Personality of Godhead Himself.
yena eva aham bhagavataḥ vāsudevasya vedhasaḥ māyā anubhāvam avidam yena gacchanti tat padam	By that confidential knowledge, I could understand clearly the influence of the energy of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the creator, maintainer and annihilator of everything. By knowing that, one can return to Him and personally meet Him.
etat saṁsūcitam brahman tāpa traya cikitsitam yat īśvare bhagavati karma brahmaṇi bhāvitam	O Brāhmaṇa Vyāsadeva, it is decided by the learned that the best remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries is to dedicate one’s activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead [Śrī Kṛṣṇa].
āmayaḥ yaḥ ca bhūtānām jāyate yena suvrata tat eva hi āmayam dravyam na punāti cikitsitam	O good soul, does not a thing, applied therapeutically, cure a disease which was caused by that very same thing?
evam nṛṇām kriyā yogāḥ sarve saṁsṛti hetavaḥ te eva ātma vināśāya kalpante kalpitāḥ pare	Thus when all a man’s activities are dedicated to the service of the Lord, those very activities which caused his perpetual bondage become the destroyer of the tree of work.
yat atra kriyate karma bhagavat paritoṣaṇam jñānam yat tat adhīnam hi bhakti yoga samanvitam	Whatever work is done here in this life for the satisfaction of the mission of the Lord is called bhakti-yoga, or transcendental loving service to the Lord, and what is called knowledge becomes a concomitant factor.
kurvāṇāḥ yatra karmāṇi bhagavat śikṣayā asakṛt gṛṇanti guṇa nāmāni kṛṣṇasya anusmaranti ca	While performing duties according to the order of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one constantly remembers Him, His names and His qualities.
oṁ namaḥ bhagavate tubhyam vāsudevāya dhīmahi pradyumnāya, aniruddhāya and saṅkarṣaṇāya namaḥ ca	Let us all chant the glories of Vāsudeva along with His plenary expansions Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Saṅkarṣaṇa.
iti mūrti abhidhānena mantra mūrtim amūrtikam yajate yajña puruṣam saḥ samyak darśanaḥ pumān	Thus he is the actual seer who worships, in the form of transcendental sound representation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, who has no material form.
imam sva nigamam brahman avetya mat anuṣṭhitam adāt me jñānam aiśvaryam svasmin bhāvam ca keśavaḥ	O brāhmaṇa, thus by the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa I was endowed first with the transcendental knowledge of the Lord as inculcated in the confidential parts of the Vedas, then with the spiritual opulences, and then with His intimate loving service.
tvam api adabhra śruta viśrutam vibhoḥ samāpyate yena vidām bubhutsitam prākhyāhi duḥkhaiḥ muhuḥ ardita ātmanām saṅkleśa nirvāṇam uśanti na anyathā	Please, therefore, describe the almighty Lord’s activities which you have learned by your vast knowledge of the Vedas, for that will satisfy the hankerings of great learned men and at the same time mitigate the miseries of the masses of common people who are always suffering from material pangs. Indeed, there is no other way to get out of such miseries.
sūtaḥ uvāca evam niśamya bhagavān devarṣeḥ janma karma ca bhūyaḥ papraccha tam brahman vyāsaḥ satyavatī sutaḥ	Sūta said: O brāhmaṇas, thus hearing all about Śrī Nārada’s birth and activities, Vyāsadeva, the incarnation of God and son of Satyavatī, inquired as follows.
vyāsaḥ uvāca bhikṣubhiḥ vipravasite vijñāna ādeṣṭṛbhiḥ tava vartamānaḥ vayasi ādye tataḥ kim akarot bhavān	Śrī Vyāsadeva said: What did you [Nārada] do after the departure of the great sages who had instructed you in scientific transcendental knowledge before the beginning of your present birth?
svāyambhuva kayā vṛttyā vartitam te param vayaḥ katham ca idam udasrākṣīḥ kāle prāpte kalevaram	O son of Brahmā, how did you pass your life after initiation, and how did you attain this body, having quit your old one in due course?
prāk kalpa viṣayām etām smṛtim te muni sattama na hi eṣaḥ vyavadhāt kālaḥ eṣaḥ sarva nirākṛtiḥ	O great sage, time annihilates everything in due course, so how is it that this subject matter, which happened prior to this day of Brahmā, is still fresh in your memory, undisturbed by time?
nāradaḥ uvāca bhikṣubhiḥ vipravasite vijñāna ādeṣṭṛbhiḥ mama vartamānaḥ vayasi ādye tataḥ etat akāraṣam	Śrī Nārada said: The great sages, who had imparted scientific knowledge of transcendence to me, departed for other places, and I had to pass my life in this way.
eka ātmajā me jananī yoṣit mūḍhā ca kiṅkarī mayi ātmaje ananya gatau cakre sneha anubandhanam	I was the only son of my mother, who was not only a simple woman but a maidservant as well. Since I was her only offspring, she had no other alternative for protection: she bound me with the tie of affection.
sā asvatantrā na kalpā āsīt yoga kṣemam mama icchatī īśasya hi vaśe lokaḥ yoṣā dāru mayī yathā	She wanted to look after my maintenance properly, but because she was not independent, she was not able to do anything for me. The world is under the full control of the Supreme Lord; therefore everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master.
aham ca tat brahma kule ūṣivān tat upekṣayā dik deśa kāla avyutpannaḥ bālakaḥ pañca hāyanaḥ	When I was a mere child of five years, I lived in a brāhmaṇa school. I was dependent on my mother’s affection and had no experience of different lands.
ekadā nirgatām gehāt duhantīm niśi gām pathi sarpaḥ adaśat padā spṛṣṭaḥ kṛpaṇām kāla coditaḥ	Once upon a time, my poor mother, when going out one night to milk a cow, was bitten on the leg by a serpent, influenced by supreme time.
tadā tat aham īśasya bhaktānām śam abhīpsataḥ anugraham manyamānaḥ prātiṣṭham diśam uttarām	I took this as the special mercy of the Lord, who always desires benediction for His devotees, and so thinking, I started for the north.
sphītān jana padān tatra pura grāma vraja ākarān kheṭa kharvaṭa vāṭīḥ ca vanāni upavanāni ca	After my departure, I passed through many flourishing metropolises, towns, villages, animal farms, mines, agricultural lands, valleys, flower gardens, nursery gardens and natural forests.
citra dhātu vicitra adrīn ibha bhagna bhuja drumān jalāśayān śiva jalān nalinīḥ sura sevitāḥ citra svanaiḥ patra rathaiḥ vibhramat bhramara śriyaḥ	I passed through hills and mountains full of reservoirs of various minerals like gold, silver and copper, and through tracts of land with reservoirs of water filled with beautiful lotus flowers, fit for the denizens of heaven, decorated with bewildered bees and singing birds.
nala veṇu śaraḥ tanba kuśa kīcaka gahvaram ekaḥ eva atiyātaḥ aham adrākṣam vipinam mahat ghoram pratibhaya ākāram vyāla ulūka śiva ajiram	I then passed alone through many forests of rushes, bamboo, reeds, sharp grass, weeds and caves, which were very difficult to go through alone. I visited deep, dark and dangerously fearful forests, which were the play yards of snakes, owls and jackals.
pariśrānta indriya ātmā aham tṛṭ parītaḥ bubhukṣitaḥ snātvā pītvā hrade nadyāḥ upaspṛṣṭaḥ gata śramaḥ	Thus traveling, I felt tired, both bodily and mentally, and I was both thirsty and hungry. So I took a bath in a river lake and also drank water. By contacting water, I got relief from my exhaustion.
tasmin nirmanuje araṇye pippala upasthe āśritaḥ ātmanā ātmānam ātma stham yathā śrutam acintayam	After that, under the shadow of a banyan tree in an uninhabited forest I began to meditate upon the Supersoul situated within, using my intelligence, as I had learned from liberated souls.
dhyāyataḥ caraṇa ambhojam bhāva nirjita cetasā autkaṇṭhya aśru kala akṣasya hṛdi āsīt me śanaiḥ hariḥ	As soon as I began to meditate upon the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead with my mind transformed in transcendental love, tears rolled down my eyes, and without delay the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, appeared on the lotus of my heart.
premā atibhara nirbhinna pulaka aṅgaḥ ati nirvṛtaḥ ānanda samplave līnaḥ na apaśyam ubhayam mune	O Vyāsadeva, at that time, being exceedingly overpowered by feelings of happiness, every part of my body became separately enlivened. Being absorbed in an ocean of ecstasy, I could not see both myself and the Lord.
rūpam bhagavataḥ yat tat manaḥ kāntam śucā apaham apaśyan sahasā uttasthe vaiklavyāt durmanāḥ iva	The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind’s desire and at once erases all mental incongruities. Upon losing that form, I suddenly got up, being perturbed, as is usual when one loses that which is desirable.
didṛkṣuḥ tat aham bhūyaḥ praṇidhāya manaḥ hṛdi vīkṣamāṇaḥ api na apaśyam avitṛptaḥ iva āturaḥ	I desired to see again that transcendental form of the Lord, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart with eagerness to view the form again, I could not see Him any more, and thus dissatisfied, I was very much aggrieved.
evam yatantam vijane mām āha agocaraḥ girām gambhīra ślakṣṇayā vācā śucaḥ praśamayan iva	Seeing my attempts in that lonely place, the Personality of Godhead, who is transcendental to all mundane description, spoke to me with gravity and pleasing words, just to mitigate my grief.
hanta asmin janmani bhavān mā mām draṣṭum iha arhati avipakva kaṣāyāṇām durdarśaḥ aham kuyoginām	O Nārada [the Lord spoke], I regret that during this lifetime you will not be able to see Me anymore. Those who are incomplete in service and who are not completely free from all material taints can hardly see Me.
sakṛt yat darśitam rūpam etat kāmāya te anagha mat kāmaḥ śanakaiḥ sādhuḥ sarvān muñcati hṛt śayān	O virtuous one, you have only once seen My person, and this is just to increase your desire for Me, because the more you hanker for Me, the more you will be freed from all material desires.
sat sevayā adīrghayā api jātā mayi dṛḍhā matiḥ hitvā avadyam imam lokam gantā mat janatām asi	By service of the Absolute Truth, even for a few days, a devotee attains firm and fixed intelligence in Me. Consequently he goes on to become My associate in the transcendental world after giving up the present deplorable material worlds.
matiḥ mayi nibaddhā iyam na vipadyeta karhicit prajā sarga nirodhe api smṛtiḥ ca mat anugrahāt	Intelligence engaged in My devotion cannot be thwarted at any time. Even at the time of creation, as well as at the time of annihilation, your remembrance will continue by My mercy.
etāvat uktvā upararāma tat mahat bhūtam nabhaḥ liṅgam aliṅgam īśvaram aham ca tasmai mahatām mahīyase śīrṣṇā avanāmam vidadhe anukampitaḥ	Then that supreme authority, personified by sound and unseen by eyes, but most wonderful, stopped speaking. Feeling a sense of gratitude, I offered my obeisances unto Him, bowing my head.
nāmāni anantasya hata trapaḥ paṭhan guhyāni bhadrāṇi kṛtāni ca smaran gām paryaṭan tuṣṭa manāḥ gata spṛhaḥ kālam pratīkṣan vimadaḥ vimatsaraḥ	Thus I began chanting the holy name and fame of the Lord by repeated recitation, ignoring all the formalities of the material world. Such chanting and remembering of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are benedictory. So doing, I traveled all over the earth, fully satisfied, humble and unenvious.
evam kṛṣṇa mateḥ brahman na āsaktasya amala ātmanaḥ kālaḥ prādurabhūt kāle taḍit saudāmanī yathā	And so, O Brāhmaṇa Vyāsadeva, in due course of time I, who was fully absorbed in thinking of Kṛṣṇa and who therefore had no attachments, being completely freed from all material taints, met with death, as lightning and illumination occur simultaneously.
prayujyamāne mayi tām śuddhām bhāgavatīm tanum ārabdha karma nirvāṇaḥ nyapatat pāñca bhautikaḥ	Having been awarded a transcendental body befitting an associate of the Personality of Godhead, I quit the body made of five material elements, and thus all acquired fruitive results of work [karma] stopped.
kalpa ante idam ādāya śayāne ambhasi udanvataḥ śiśayiṣoḥ anuprāṇam viviśe antaḥ aham vibhoḥ	At the end of the millennium, when the Personality of Godhead, Lord Nārāyaṇa, lay down within the water of devastation, Brahmā began to enter into Him along with all creative elements, and I also entered through His breathing.
sahasra yuga paryante utthāya idam sisṛkṣataḥ marīci miśrāḥ ṛṣayaḥ prāṇebhyaḥ aham ca jajñire	After 4,300,000,000 solar years, when Brahmā awoke to create again by the will of the Lord, all the ṛṣis like Marīci, Aṅgirā, Atri and so on were created from the transcendental body of the Lord, and I also appeared along with them.
antaḥ bahiḥ ca lokān trīn paryemi askandita vrataḥ anugrahāt mahā viṣṇoḥ avighāta gatiḥ kvacit	Since then, by the grace of the almighty Viṣṇu, I travel everywhere without restriction both in the transcendental world and in the three divisions of the material world. This is because I am fixed in unbroken devotional service of the Lord.
deva dattām imām vīṇām svara brahma vibhūṣitām mūrcchayitvā hari kathām gāyamānaḥ carāmi aham	And thus I travel, constantly singing the transcendental message of the glories of the Lord, vibrating this instrument called a vīṇā, which is charged with transcendental sound and which was given to me by Lord Kṛṣṇa.
pragāyataḥ sva vīryāṇi tīrtha pādaḥ priya śravāḥ āhūtaḥ iva me śīghram darśanam yāti cetasi	The Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose glories and activities are pleasing to hear, at once appears on the seat of my heart, as if called for, as soon as I begin to chant His holy activities.
etat hi ātura cittānām mātrā sparśa icchayā muhuḥ bhava sindhu plavaḥ dṛṣṭaḥ hari carya anuvarṇanam	It is personally experienced by me that those who are always full of cares and anxieties due to desiring contact of the senses with their objects can cross the ocean of nescience on a most suitable boat — the constant chanting of the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead.
yama ādibhiḥ yoga pathaiḥ kāma lobha hataḥ muhuḥ mukunda sevayā yadvat tathā ātmā addhā na śāmyati	It is true that by practicing restraint of the senses by the yoga system one can get relief from the disturbances of desire and lust, but this is not sufficient to give satisfaction to the soul, for this [satisfaction] is derived from devotional service to the Personality of Godhead.
sarvam tat idam ākhyātam yat pṛṣṭaḥ aham tvayā anagha janma karma rahasyam me bhavataḥ ca ātma toṣaṇam	O Vyāsadeva, you are freed from all sins. Thus I have explained my birth and activities for self-realization, as you asked. All this will be conducive for your personal satisfaction also.
sūtaḥ uvāca evam sambhāṣya bhagavān nāradaḥ vāsavī sutam āmantrya vīṇām raṇayan yayau yādṛcchikaḥ muniḥ	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Thus addressing Vyāsadeva, Śrīla Nārada Muni took leave of him, and vibrating on his vīṇā instrument, he left to wander at his free will.
aho devarṣiḥ dhanyaḥ ayam yat kīrtim śārṅga dhanvanaḥ gāyan mādyan idam tantryā ramayati āturam jagat	All glory and success to Śrīla Nārada Muni because he glorifies the activities of the Personality of Godhead, and so doing he himself takes pleasure and also enlivens all the distressed souls of the universe.
śaunakaḥ uvāca nirgate nārade sūta bhagavān bādarāyaṇaḥ śrutavān tat abhipretam tataḥ kim akarot vibhuḥ	Ṛṣi Śaunaka asked: O Sūta, the great and transcendentally powerful Vyāsadeva heard everything from Śrī Nārada Muni. So after Nārada’s departure, what did Vyāsadeva do?
sūtaḥ uvāca brahma nadyām sarasvatyām āśramaḥ paścime taṭe śamyāprāsaḥ iti proktaḥ ṛṣīṇām satra vardhanaḥ	Śrī Sūta said: On the western bank of the river Sarasvatī, which is intimately related with the Vedas, there is a cottage for meditation at Śamyāprāsa which enlivens the transcendental activities of the sages.
tasmin sve āśrame vyāsaḥ badarī ṣaṇḍa maṇḍite āsīnaḥ apaḥ upaspṛśya praṇidadhyau manaḥ svayam	In that place, Śrīla Vyāsadeva, in his own āśrama, which was surrounded by berry trees, sat down to meditate after touching water for purification.
bhakti yogena manasi samyak praṇihite amale apaśyat puruṣam pūrṇam māyām ca tat apāśrayam	Thus he fixed his mind, perfectly engaging it by linking it in devotional service [bhakti-yoga] without any tinge of materialism, and thus he saw the Absolute Personality of Godhead along with His external energy, which was under full control.
yayā sammohitaḥ jīvaḥ ātmānam tri guṇa ātmakam paraḥ api manute anartham tat kṛtam ca abhipadyate	Due to this external energy, the living entity, although transcendental to the three modes of material nature, thinks of himself as a material product and thus undergoes the reactions of material miseries.
anartha upaśamam sākṣāt bhakti yogam adhokṣaje lokasya ajānataḥ vidvān cakre sātvata saṁhitām	The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyāsadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth.
yasyām vai śrūyamāṇāyām kṛṣṇe parama pūruṣe bhaktiḥ utpadyate puṁsaḥ śoka moha bhaya apahā	Simply by giving aural reception to this Vedic literature, the feeling for loving devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sprouts up at once to extinguish the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness.
saḥ saṁhitām bhāgavatīm kṛtvā anukramya ca ātma jam śukam adhyāpayām āsa nivṛtti niratam muniḥ	The great sage Vyāsadeva, after compiling the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and revising it, taught it to his own son, Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who was already engaged in self-realization.
śaunakaḥ uvāca saḥ vai nivṛtti nirataḥ sarvatra upekṣakaḥ muniḥ kasya vā bṛhatīm etām ātma ārāmaḥ samabhyasat	Śrī Śaunaka asked Sūta Gosvāmī: Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī was already on the path of self-realization, and thus he was pleased with his own self. So why did he take the trouble to undergo the study of such a vast literature?
sūtaḥ uvāca ātmārāmāḥ ca munayaḥ nirgranthāḥ api urukrame kurvanti ahaitukīm bhaktim ittham bhūta guṇaḥ hariḥ	Sūta Gosvāmī said: All different varieties of ātmārāmas [those who take pleasure in the ātmā, or spirit self], especially those established on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls.
hareḥ guṇa ākṣipta matiḥ bhagavān bādarāyaṇiḥ adhyagāt mahat ākhyānam nityam viṣṇu jana priyaḥ	Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, son of Śrīla Vyāsadeva, was not only transcendentally powerful. He was also very dear to the devotees of the Lord. Thus he underwent the study of this great narration [Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam].
parīkṣitaḥ atha rājarṣeḥ janma karma vilāpanam saṁsthām ca pāṇḍu putrāṇām vakṣye kṛṣṇa kathā udayam	Sūta Gosvāmī thus addressed the ṛṣis headed by Śaunaka: Now I shall begin the transcendental narration of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and topics of the birth, activities and deliverance of King Parīkṣit, the sage amongst kings, as well as topics of the renunciation of the worldly order by the sons of Pāṇḍu.
yadā mṛdhe kaurava sṛñjayānām vīreṣu atho vīra gatim gateṣu vṛkodara āviddha gadā abhimarśa bhagna uru daṇḍe dhṛtarāṣṭra putre bhartuḥ priyam drauṇiḥ iti sma paśyan kṛṣṇā sutānām svapatām śirāṁsi upāharat vipriyam eva tasya jugupsitam karma vigarhayanti	When the respective warriors of both camps, namely the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, were killed on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations, and when the son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra fell down lamenting, his spine broken, being beaten by the club of Bhīmasena, the son of Droṇācārya [Aśvatthāmā] beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadī and delivered the heads as a prize to his master, foolishly thinking that he would be pleased. Duryodhana, however, disapproved of the heinous act, and he was not pleased in the least.
mātā śiśūnām nidhanam sutānām niśamya ghoram paritapyamānā tadā arudat vāṣpa kala ākula akṣī tām sāntvayan āha kirīṭamālī	Draupadī, the mother of the five children of the Pāṇḍavas, after hearing of the massacre of her sons, began to cry in distress with eyes full of tears. Trying to pacify her in her great loss, Arjuna spoke to her thus:
tadā śucaḥ te pramṛjāmi bhadre yat brahma bandhoḥ śiraḥ ātatāyinaḥ gāṇḍīva muktaiḥ viśikhaiḥ upāhare tvā ākramya yat snāsyasi dagdha putrā	O gentle lady, when I present you with the head of that brāhmaṇa, after beheading him with arrows from my Gāṇḍīva bow, I shall then wipe the tears from your eyes and pacify you. Then, after burning your sons’ bodies, you can take your bath standing on his head.
iti priyām valgu vicitra jalpaiḥ saḥ sāntvayitvā acyuta mitra sūtaḥ anvādravat daṁśitaḥ ugra dhanvā kapi dhvajaḥ guru putram rathena	Arjuna, who is guided by the infallible Lord as friend and driver, thus satisfied the dear lady by such statements. Then he dressed in armor and armed himself with furious weapons, and getting into his chariot, he set out to follow Aśvatthāmā, the son of his martial teacher.
tam āpatantam saḥ vilakṣya dūrāt kumāra hā udvigna manāḥ rathena parādravat prāṇa parīpsuḥ urvyām yāvat gamam rudra bhayāt yathā kaḥ	Aśvatthāmā, the murderer of the princes, seeing from a great distance Arjuna coming at him with great speed, fled in his chariot, panic stricken, just to save his life, as Brahmā fled in fear from Śiva.
yadā aśaraṇam ātmānam aikṣata śrānta vājinam astram brahma śiraḥ mene ātma trāṇam dvija ātma jaḥ	When the son of the brāhmaṇa [Aśvatthāmā] saw that his horses were tired, he considered that there was no alternative for protection outside of his using the ultimate weapon, the brahmāstra [nuclear weapon].
atha upaspṛśya salilam sandadhe tat samāhitaḥ ajānan api saṁhāram prāṇa kṛcchre upasthite	Since his life was in danger, he touched water in sanctity and concentrated upon the chanting of the hymns for throwing nuclear weapons, although he did not know how to withdraw such weapons.
tataḥ prāduṣkṛtam tejaḥ pracaṇḍam sarvataḥ diśam prāṇa āpadam abhiprekṣya viṣṇum jiṣṇuḥ uvāca ha	Thereupon a glaring light spread in all directions. It was so fierce that Arjuna thought his own life in danger, and so he began to address Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
arjunaḥ uvāca kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa mahā bāho bhaktānām abhayaṅkara tvam ekaḥ dahyamānānām apavargaḥ asi saṁsṛteḥ	Arjuna said: O my Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, You are the almighty Personality of Godhead. There is no limit to Your different energies. Therefore only You are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of Your devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in You only.
tvam ādyaḥ puruṣaḥ sākṣāt īśvaraḥ prakṛteḥ paraḥ māyām vyudasya cit śaktyā kaivalye sthitaḥ ātmani	You are the original Personality of Godhead who expands Himself all over the creations and is transcendental to material energy. You have cast away the effects of the material energy by dint of Your spiritual potency. You are always situated in eternal bliss and transcendental knowledge.
saḥ eva jīva lokasya māyā mohita cetasaḥ vidhatse svena vīryeṇa śreyaḥ dharma ādi lakṣaṇam	And yet, though You are beyond the purview of the material energy, You execute the four principles of liberation characterized by religion and so on for the ultimate good of the conditioned souls.
tathā ayam ca avatāraḥ te bhuvaḥ bhāra jihīrṣayā svānām ca ananya bhāvānām anudhyānāya ca asakṛt	Thus You descend as an incarnation to remove the burden of the world and to benefit Your friends, especially those who are Your exclusive devotees and are constantly rapt in meditation upon You.
kim idam svit kutaḥ vā iti deva deva na vedmi aham sarvataḥ mukham āyāti tejaḥ parama dāruṇam	O Lord of lords, how is it that this dangerous effulgence is spreading all around? Where does it come from? I do not understand it.
śrī bhagavān uvāca vettha idam droṇa putrasya brāhmam astram pradarśitam na eva asau veda saṁhāram prāṇa bādhe upasthite	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Know from Me that this is the act of the son of Droṇa. He has thrown the hymns of nuclear energy [brahmāstra], and he does not know how to retract the glare. He has helplessly done this, being afraid of imminent death.
na hi asya anyatamam kiñcit astram prati avakarśanam jahi astra tejaḥ unnaddham astra jñaḥ hi astra tejasā	O Arjuna, only another brahmāstra can counteract this weapon. Since you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon’s glare with the power of your own weapon.
sūtaḥ uvāca śrutvā bhagavatā proktam phālgunaḥ para vīra hā spṛṣṭvā āpaḥ tam parikramya brāhmam brāhma astram sandadhe	Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: Hearing this from the Personality of Godhead, Arjuna touched water for purification, and after circumambulating Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, he cast his brahmāstra weapon to counteract the other one.
saṁhatya anyonyam ubhayoḥ tejasī śara saṁvṛte āvṛtya rodasī kham ca vavṛdhāte arka vahni vat	When the rays of the two brahmāstras combined, a great circle of fire, like the disc of the sun, covered all outer space and the whole firmament of planets.

atha upetya sva śibiram govinda priya sārathiḥ nyavedayat tam priyāyai śocantyai ātma jān hatān	After reaching his own camp, Arjuna, along with his dear friend and charioteer [Śrī Kṛṣṇa], entrusted the murderer unto his dear wife, who was lamenting for her murdered sons.

śrī bhagavān uvāca brahma bandhuḥ na hantavyaḥ ātatāyī vadha arhaṇaḥ mayā eva ubhayam āmnātam paripāhi anuśāsanam kuru pratiśrutam satyam yat tat sāntvayatā priyām priyam ca bhīmasenasya pāñcālyāḥ mahyam eva ca	The Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa said: A friend of a brāhmaṇa is not to be killed, but if he is an aggressor he must be killed.

tathā paramahaṁsānām munīnām amala ātmanām bhakti yoga vidhāna artham katham paśyema hi striyaḥ	You Yourself descend to propagate the transcendental science of devotional service unto the hearts of the advanced transcendentalists and mental speculators, who are purified by being able to discriminate between matter and spirit.

And now You have saved us from the weapon of Aśvatthāmā.
vipadaḥ santu tāḥ śaśvat tatra tatra jagat guro bhavataḥ darśanam yat syāt apunaḥ bhava darśanam	I wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths.
janma aiśvarya śruta śrībhiḥ edhamāna madaḥ pumān na eva arhati abhidhātum vai tvām akiñcana gocaram	My Lord, Your Lordship can easily be approached, but only by those who are materially exhausted. One who is on the path of [material] progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot approach You with sincere feeling.
namaḥ akiñcana vittāya nivṛtta guṇa vṛttaye ātma ārāmāya śāntāya kaivalya pataye namaḥ	My obeisances are unto You, who are the property of the materially impoverished. You have nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material modes of nature. You are self-satisfied, and therefore You are the most gentle and are master of the monists.
manye tvām kālam īśānam anādi nidhanam vibhum samam carantam sarvatra bhūtānām yat mithaḥ kaliḥ	My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. In distributing Your mercy, You are equal to everyone. The dissensions between living beings are due to social intercourse.
na veda kaścit bhagavan cikīrṣitam tava īhamānasya nṛṇām viḍambanam na yasya kaścit dayitaḥ asti karhicit dveṣyaḥ ca yasmin viṣamā matiḥ nṛṇām	O Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and so are misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine that You are partial.
janma karma ca viśva ātman ajasya akartuḥ ātmanaḥ tiryak nṛ ṛṣiṣu yādaḥsu tat atyanta viḍambanam	Of course it is bewildering, O soul of the universe, that You work, though You are inactive, and that You take birth, though You are the vital force and the unborn. You Yourself descend amongst animals, men, sages and aquatics. Verily, this is bewildering.
gopī ādade tvayi kṛtāgasi dāma tāvat yā te daśā aśru kalila añjana sambhrama akṣam vaktram ninīya bhaya bhāvanayā sthitasya sā mām vimohayati bhīḥ api yat bibheti	My dear Kṛṣṇa, Yaśodā took up a rope to bind You when You committed an offense, and Your perturbed eyes overflooded with tears, which washed the mascara from Your eyes. And You were afraid, though fear personified is afraid of You. This sight is bewildering to me.
kecit āhuḥ ajam jātam puṇya ślokasya kīrtaye yadoḥ priyasya anvavāye malayasya iva candanam	Some say that the Unborn is born for the glorification of pious kings, and others say that He is born to please King Yadu, one of Your dearest devotees.

apare vasudevasya devakyām yācitaḥ abhyagāt ajaḥ tvam asya kṣemāya vadhāya ca sura dviṣām	Others say that since both Vasudeva and Devakī prayed for You, You have taken Your birth as their son.

bhave asmin kliśyamānānām avidyā kāma karmabhiḥ śravaṇa smaraṇa arhāṇi kariṣyan iti kecana	And yet others say that You appeared for the sake of rejuvenating the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshiping and so on in order that the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs might take advantage and gain liberation.
śṛṇvanti gāyanti gṛṇanti abhīkṣṇaśaḥ smaranti nandanti tava īhitam janāḥ te eva paśyanti acireṇa tāvakam bhava pravāha uparamam pada ambujam	O Kṛṣṇa, those who continuously hear, chant and repeat Your transcendental activities, or take pleasure in others’ doing so, certainly see Your lotus feet, which alone can stop the repetition of birth and death.
api adya naḥ tvam sva kṛta īhita prabho jihāsasi svit suhṛdaḥ anujīvinaḥ yeṣām na ca anyat bhavataḥ pada ambujāt parāyaṇam rājasu yojita aṁhasām	O my Lord, You have executed all duties Yourself. Are you leaving us today, though we are completely dependent on Your mercy and have no one else to protect us, now when all kings are at enmity with us?
ke vayam nāma rūpābhyām yadubhiḥ saha pāṇḍavāḥ bhavataḥ adarśanam yarhi hṛṣīkāṇām iva īśituḥ	As the name and fame of a particular body is finished with the disappearance of the living spirit, similarly if You do not look upon us, all our fame and activities, along with the Pāṇḍavas and Yadus, will end at once.
na iyam śobhiṣyate tatra yathā idānīm gadādhara tvat padaiḥ aṅkitā bhāti sva lakṣaṇa vilakṣitaiḥ	O Gadādhara [Kṛṣṇa], our kingdom is now being marked by the impressions of Your feet, and therefore it appears beautiful. But when You leave, it will no longer be so.
ime jana padāḥ svṛddhāḥ supakva auṣadhi vīrudhaḥ vana adri nadī udanvantaḥ hi edhante tava vīkṣitaiḥ	All these cities and villages are flourishing in all respects because the herbs and grains are in abundance, the trees are full of fruits, the rivers are flowing, the hills are full of minerals and the oceans full of wealth. And this is all due to Your glancing over them.
atha viśva īśa viśva ātman viśva mūrte svakeṣu me sneha pāśam imam chindhi dṛḍham pāṇḍuṣu vṛṣṇiṣu	O Lord of the universe, soul of the universe, O personality of the form of the universe, please, therefore, sever my tie of affection for my kinsmen, the Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis.
tvayi me ananya viṣayā matiḥ madhu pate asakṛt ratim udvahatāt addhā gaṅgā iva ogham udanvati	O Lord of Madhu, as the Ganges forever flows to the sea without hindrance, let my attraction be constantly drawn unto You without being diverted to anyone else.
śrī kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa sakha vṛṣṇi ṛṣabha avani dhruk rājanya vaṁśa dahana anapavarga vīrya govinda go dvija sura arti hara avatāra yoga īśvara akhila guro bhagavan namaḥ te	O Kṛṣṇa, O friend of Arjuna, O chief amongst the descendants of Vṛṣṇi, You are the destroyer of those political parties which are disturbing elements on this earth. Your prowess never deteriorates. You are the proprietor of the transcendental abode, and You descend to relieve the distresses of the cows, the brāhmaṇas and the devotees. You possess all mystic powers, and You are the preceptor of the entire universe. You are the almighty God, and I offer You my respectful obeisances.
sūtaḥ uvāca pṛthayā ittham kala padaiḥ pariṇūta akhila udayaḥ mandam jahāsa vaikuṇṭhaḥ mohayan iva māyayā	Sūta Gosvāmī said: The Lord, thus hearing the prayers of Kuntīdevī, composed in choice words for His glorification, mildly smiled. That smile was as enchanting as His mystic power.
tām bāḍham iti upāmantrya praviśya gajasāhvayam striyaḥ ca sva puram yāsyan premṇā rājñā nivāritaḥ	Thus accepting the prayers of Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī, the Lord subsequently informed other ladies of His departure by entering the palace of Hastināpura. But upon preparing to leave, He was stopped by King Yudhiṣṭhira, who implored Him lovingly.
vyāsa ādyaiḥ īśvara īhā jñaiḥ kṛṣṇena adbhuta karmaṇā prabodhitaḥ api itihāsaiḥ na abudhyata śucā arpitaḥ	King Yudhiṣṭhira, who was much aggrieved, could not be convinced, despite instructions by great sages headed by Vyāsa and the Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, the performer of superhuman feats, and despite all historical evidence.

aho me paśyata ajñānam hṛdi rūḍham durātmanaḥ pārakyasya eva dehasya bahvyaḥ me akṣauhiṇīḥ hatāḥ	King Yudhiṣṭhira said: O my lot! I am the most sinful man! Just see my heart, which is full of ignorance! This body, which is ultimately meant for others, has killed many, many phalanxes of men.
bāla dvi ja suhṛt mitra pitṛ bhrātṛ guru druhaḥ na me syāt nirayāt mokṣaḥ hi api varṣa ayuta āyutaiḥ	I have killed many boys, brāhmaṇas, well-wishers, friends, parents, preceptors and brothers. Though I live millions of years, I will not be relieved from the hell that awaits me for all these sins.

strīṇām mat hata bandhūnām drohaḥ yaḥ asau iha utthitaḥ karmabhiḥ gṛhamedhīyaiḥ na aham kalpaḥ vyapohitum	I have killed many friends of women, and I have thus caused enmity to such an extent that it is not possible to undo it by material welfare work.
yathā paṅkena paṅka ambhaḥ surayā vā surākṛtam bhūta hatyām tathā eva ekām na yajñaiḥ mārṣṭum arhati	As it is not possible to filter muddy water through mud, or purify a wine-stained pot with wine, it is not possible to counteract the killing of men by sacrificing animals.
sūtaḥ uvāca iti bhītaḥ prajā drohāt sarva dharma vivitsayā tataḥ vinaśanam prāgāt yatra deva vrataḥ apatat	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Being afraid for having killed so many subjects on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira went to the scene of the massacre.

tadā te bhrātaraḥ sarve sat aśvaiḥ svarṇa bhūṣitaiḥ anvagacchan rathaiḥ viprāḥ vyāsa dhaumya ādayaḥ tathā	At that time all his brothers followed him on beautiful chariots drawn by first-class horses decorated with gold ornaments.

Seeing this, Bhīṣmadeva congratulated them with feeling. There were tears of ecstasy in his eyes, for he was overwhelmed by love and affection.
aho kaṣṭam aho anyāyyam yat yūyam dharma nandanāḥ jīvitum na arhatha kliṣṭam vipra dharma acyuta āśrayāḥ	Bhīṣmadeva said: Oh, what terrible sufferings and what terrible injustices you good souls suffer for being the sons of religion personified. You did not deserve to remain alive under those tribulations, yet you were protected by the brāhmaṇas, God and religion.
saṁsthite ati rathe pāṇḍau pṛthā bāla prajā vadhūḥ yuṣmat kṛte bahūn kleśān prāptā toka vatī muhuḥ	As far as my daughter-in-law Kuntī is concerned, upon the great General Pāṇḍu’s death, she became a widow with many children, and therefore she suffered greatly.

sarvam kāla kṛtam manye bhavatām ca yat apriyam sa pālaḥ yat vaśe lokaḥ vāyoḥ iva ghana āvaliḥ	In my opinion, this is all due to inevitable time, under whose control everyone in every planet is carried, just as the clouds are carried by the wind.
yatra dharma sutaḥ rājā gadā pāṇiḥ vṛkodaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ astrī gāṇḍivam cāpam suhṛt kṛṣṇaḥ tataḥ vipat	Oh, how wonderful is the influence of inevitable time! It is irreversible — otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhiṣṭhira, the son of the demigod controlling religion; Bhīma, the great fighter with a club; the great bowman Arjuna with his mighty weapon Gāṇḍīva; and above all, the Lord, the direct well-wisher of the Pāṇḍavas?
na hi asya karhicit rājan pumān veda vidhitsitam yat vijijñāsayā yuktāḥ muhyanti kavayaḥ api hi	O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord [Śrī Kṛṣṇa]. Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered.
tasmāt idam daiva tantram vyavasya bharata ṛṣabha tasya anuvihitaḥ anāthāḥ nātha pāhi prajāḥ prabho	O best among the descendants of Bharata [Yudhiṣṭhira], I maintain, therefore, that all this is within the plan of the Lord. Accepting the inconceivable plan of the Lord, you must follow it. You are now the appointed administrative head, and, my lord, you should now take care of those subjects who are now rendered helpless.
eṣaḥ vai bhagavān sākṣāt ādyaḥ nārāyaṇaḥ pumān mohayan māyayā lokam gūḍhaḥ carati vṛṣṇiṣu	This Śrī Kṛṣṇa is no other than the inconceivable, original Personality of Godhead.

sarva ātmanaḥ sama dṛśaḥ hi advayasya anahaṅkṛteḥ tat kṛtam mati vaiṣamyam niravadyasya na kvacit	Being the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He is present in everyone’s heart. He is equally kind to everyone, and He is free from the false ego of differentiation. Therefore whatever He does is free from material inebriety. He is equibalanced.
tathāpi ekānta bhakteṣu paśya bhū pa anukampitam yat me asūn tyajataḥ sākṣāt kṛṣṇaḥ darśanam āgataḥ	Yet, despite His being equally kind to everyone, He has graciously come before me while I am ending my life, for I am His unflinching servitor.
bhaktyā āveśya manaḥ yasmin vācā yat nāma kīrtayan tyajan kalevaram yogī mucyate kāma karmabhiḥ	The Personality of Godhead, who appears in the mind of the devotee by attentive devotion and meditation and by chanting of the holy name, releases the devotee from the bondage of fruitive activities at the time of his quitting the material body.

puruṣa sva bhāva vihitān yathā varṇam yathā āśramam vairāgya rāga upādhibhyām āmnāta ubhaya lakṣaṇān	At Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira’s inquiry, Bhīṣmadeva first defined all the classifications of castes and orders of life in terms of the individual’s qualifications. Then he systematically, in twofold divisions, described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment.
dāna dharmān rāja dharmān mokṣa dharmān vibhāgaśaḥ strī dharmān bhagavat dharmān samāsa vyāsa yogataḥ	He then explained, by divisions, acts of charity, the pragmatic activities of a king and activities for salvation. Then he described the duties of women and devotees, both briefly and extensively.
dharma artha kāma mokṣān ca saha upāyān yathā mune nānā ākhyāna itihāseṣu varṇayām āsa tattva vit	Then he described the occupational duties of different orders and statuses of life, citing instances from history, for he was himself well acquainted with the truth.
dharmam pravadataḥ tasya saḥ kālaḥ pratyupasthitaḥ yaḥ yoginaḥ chanda mṛtyoḥ vāñchitaḥ tu uttarāyaṇaḥ	While Bhīṣmadeva was describing occupational duties, the sun’s course ran into the northern hemisphere. This period is desired by mystics who die at their will.
tadā upasaṁhṛtya giraḥ sahasraṇīḥ vimukta saṅgam manaḥ ādi pūruṣe kṛṣṇe lasat pīta paṭe catur bhuje puraḥ sthite amīlita dṛk vyadhārayat	Thereupon that man who spoke on different subjects with thousands of meanings, and who fought on thousands of battlefields and protected thousands of men, stopped speaking and, being completely freed from all bondage, withdrew his mind from everything else and fixed his wide-open eyes upon the original Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who stood before him, four-handed, dressed in yellow garments that glittered and shined.
viśuddhayā dhāraṇayā hata aśubhaḥ tat īkṣayā eva āśu gatā yudha śramaḥ nivṛtta sarva indriya vṛtti vibhramaḥ tuṣṭāva janyam visṛjan janārdanam	By pure meditation, looking at Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, he at once was freed from all material inauspiciousness and was relieved of all bodily pains caused by the arrow wounds. Thus all the external activities of his senses at once stopped, and he prayed transcendentally to the controller of all living beings while quitting his material body.
śrī bhīṣmaḥ uvāca iti matiḥ upakalpitā vitṛṣṇā bhagavati sātvata puṅgave vibhūmni sva sukham upagate kvacit vihartum prakṛtim upeyuṣi yat bhava pravāhaḥ	Bhīṣmadeva said: Let me now invest my thinking, feeling and willing, which were so long engaged in different subjects and occupational duties, in the all-powerful Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is always self-satisfied, but sometimes, being the leader of the devotees, He enjoys transcendental pleasure by descending to the material world, although from Him only the material world is created.
tri bhuvana kamanam tamāla varṇam ravi kara gaura varāmbaram dadhāne vapuḥ alaka kula āvṛta anana abjam vijaya sakhe ratiḥ astu me anavadyā	Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this earth in His transcendental body, which resembles the bluish color of the tamāla tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems [upper, middle and lower]. May His glittering yellow dress and His lotus face, covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fruitive results.
yudhi turaga rajaḥ vidhūmra viṣvak kaca lulita śramavāri alaṅkṛta āsye mama niśita śaraiḥ vibhidyamāna tvaci vilasat kavace astu kṛṣṇe ātmā	On the battlefield [where Śrī Kṛṣṇa attended Arjuna out of friendship], the flowing hair of Lord Kṛṣṇa turned ashen due to the dust raised by the hoofs of the horses. And because of His labor, beads of sweat wetted His face. All these decorations, intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows, were enjoyed by Him. Let my mind thus go unto Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
sapadi sakhi vacaḥ niśamya madhye nija parayoḥ balayoḥ ratham niveśya sthitavati para sainika āyuḥ akṣṇā hṛtavati pārtha sakhe ratiḥ mama astu	In obedience to the command of His friend, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered the arena of the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra between the soldiers of Arjuna and Duryodhana, and while there He shortened the life spans of the opposite party by His merciful glance. This was done simply by His looking at the enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that Kṛṣṇa.
vyavahita pṛtanā mukham nirīkṣya sva jana vadhāt vimukhasya doṣa buddhyā kumatim aharat ātma vidyayā yaḥ caraṇa ratiḥ paramasya tasya me astu	When Arjuna was seemingly polluted by ignorance upon observing the soldiers and commanders before him on the battlefield, the Lord eradicated his ignorance by delivering transcendental knowledge. May His lotus feet always remain the object of my attraction.
sva nigamam apahāya mat pratijñām ṛtam adhi kartum avaplutaḥ ratha sthaḥ dhṛta ratha caraṇaḥ abhyayāt caladguḥ hariḥ iva hantum ibham gata uttarīyaḥ	Fulfilling my vow and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up its wheel, and ran towards me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the way.
śita viśikha hataḥ viśīrṇa daṁśaḥ kṣataja pariplutaḥ ātatāyinaḥ me prasabham abhisasāra mat vadha artham saḥ bhavatu me bhagavān gatiḥ mukundaḥ	May He, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who awards salvation, be my ultimate destination. On the battlefield He charged me, as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows. His shield was scattered, and His body was smeared with blood due to the wounds.
vijaya ratha kuṭumbe ātta totre dhṛta haya raśmini tat śriyā īkṣaṇīye bhagavati ratiḥ astu me mumūrṣoḥ yam iha nirīkṣya hatāḥ gatāḥ sva rūpam	At the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver of Arjuna who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna’s chariot by all means. Those who saw Him on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra attained their original forms after death.
lalita gati vilāsa valgu hāsa praṇaya nirīkṣaṇa kalpita urumānāḥ kṛtam anukṛtavatyaḥ unmada andhāḥ prakṛtim agan kila yasya gopa vadhvaḥ	Let my mind be fixed upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose motions and smiles of love attracted the damsels of Vrajadhāma [the gopīs]. The damsels imitated the characteristic movements of the Lord [after His disappearance from the rāsa dance].
muni gaṇa nṛpa varya saṅkule antaḥ sadasi yudhiṣṭhira rāja sūye eṣām arhaṇam upapeda īkṣaṇīyaḥ mama dṛśi gocaraḥ eṣaḥ āviḥ ātmā	At the Rājasūya-yajña [sacrifice] performed by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, there was the greatest assembly of all the elite men of the world, the royal and learned orders, and in that great assembly Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was worshiped by one and all as the most exalted Personality of Godhead. This happened during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord.
tam imam aham ajam śarīra bhājām hṛdi hṛdi dhiṣṭhitam ātma kalpitānām pratidṛśam iva na ekadhā arkam ekam samadhigataḥ asmi vidhūta bheda mohaḥ	Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to His presence in everyone’s heart, even in the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone’s heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.
sūtaḥ uvāca kṛṣṇe evam bhagavati manaḥ vāk dṛṣṭi vṛttibhiḥ ātmani ātmānam āveśya saḥ antaḥ śvāsaḥ upāramat	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Thus Bhīṣmadeva merged himself in the Supersoul, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with his mind, speech, sight and actions, and thus he became silent, and his breathing stopped.

Surely he could not freely enjoy his kingdom with unrestricted consciousness.
sūtaḥ uvāca vaṁśam kuroḥ vaṁśa dava agni nirhṛtam saṁrohayitvā bhava bhāvanaḥ hariḥ niveśayitvā nija rājye īśvaraḥ yudhiṣṭhiram prīta manāḥ babhūva ha	Sūta Gosvāmī said: Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the maintainer of the world, became pleased after reestablishing Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira in his own kingdom and after restoring the Kuru dynasty, which had been exhausted by the bamboo fire of anger.
niśamya bhīṣma uktam atha acyuta uktam pravṛtta vijñāna vidhūta vibhramaḥ śaśāsa gām indra iva ajita āśrayaḥ paridhi upāntām anuja anuvartitaḥ	Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, after being enlightened by what was spoken by Bhīṣmadeva and Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the infallible, engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated. Thus he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers.
kāmam vavarṣa parjanyaḥ sarva kāma dughā mahī siṣicuḥ sma vrajān gāvaḥ payasā udhasvatīḥ mudā	During the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of man in profusion.

subhadrā draupadī kuntī virāṭa tanayā tathā gāndhārī dhṛtarāṣṭraḥ ca yuyutsuḥ gautamaḥ yamau vṛkodaraḥ ca dhaumyaḥ ca striyaḥ matsya sutā ādayaḥ na sehire vimuhyantaḥ viraham śārṅga dhanvanaḥ	At that time Subhadrā, Draupadī, Kuntī, Uttarā, Gāndhārī, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Yuyutsu, Kṛpācārya, Nakula, Sahadeva, Bhīmasena, Dhaumya and Satyavatī all nearly fainted because it was impossible for them to bear separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa.

How then could the Pāṇḍavas tolerate His separation, for they had been intimately associated with His person, seeing Him face to face, touching Him, conversing with Him, and sleeping, sitting and dining with Him?
sarve te animiṣaiḥ akṣaiḥ tam anu druta cetasaḥ vīkṣantaḥ sneha sambaddhāḥ viceluḥ tatra tatra ha	All their hearts were melting for Him on the pot of attraction. They looked at Him without blinking their eyes, and they moved hither and thither in perplexity.

He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature, and in Him only, because He is the Supreme Lord, all living beings merge, as if sleeping at night, their energy suspended.

How they must have undergone vows, baths, fire sacrifices and perfect worship of the Lord of the universe to constantly relish now the nectar from His lips [by kissing].

yā vīrya śulkena hṛtāḥ svayaṁvare pramathya caidya pramukhān hi śuṣmiṇaḥ pradyumna sāmba amba suta ādayaḥ aparāḥ yāḥ ca āhṛtāḥ bhauma vadhe sahasraśaḥ	The children of these ladies are Pradyumna, Sāmba, Amba, etc. Ladies like Rukmiṇī, Satyabhāmā and Jāmbavatī were forcibly taken away by Him from their svayaṁvara ceremonies after He defeated many powerful kings, headed by Śiśupāla. And other ladies were also forcibly taken away by Him after He killed Bhaumāsura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious.
etāḥ param strītvam apāstapeśalam nirasta śaucam bata sādhu kurvate yāsām gṛhāt puṣkara locanaḥ patiḥ na jātu apaiti āhṛtibhiḥ hṛdi spṛśan	All these women auspiciously glorified their lives despite their being without individuality and without purity.

After crossing these provinces He gradually reached the Sauvīra and Ābhīra provinces, then, west of these, reached Dvārakā at last.

tatra upanīta balayaḥ raveḥ dīpam iva ādṛtāḥ ātma ārāmam pūrṇa kāmam nija lābhena nitya dā prīti utphulla mukhāḥ procuḥ harṣa gadgadayā girā pitaram sarva suhṛdam avitāram iva arbhakāḥ	The citizens arrived before the Lord with their respective presentations, offering them to the fully satisfied and self-sufficient one, who, by His own potency, incessantly supplies others. These presentations were like the offering of a lamp to the sun. Yet the citizens began to speak in ecstatic language to receive the Lord, just as wards welcome their guardian and father.
natāḥ sma te nātha sadā aṅghri paṅkajam viriñca vairiñcya sura indra vanditam parāyaṇam kṣemam iha icchatām param na yatra kālaḥ prabhavet paraḥ prabhuḥ	The citizens said: O Lord, You are worshiped by all demigods like Brahmā, the four Sanas and even the King of heaven. You are the ultimate rest for those who are really aspiring to achieve the highest benefit of life. You are the supreme transcendental Lord, and inevitable time cannot exert its influence upon You.

They were puffed up with their military strength, their horses, elephants, chariots, infantry, etc. He Himself was not a party in the fight. He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they fought amongst themselves. He was like the wind which causes friction between bamboos and so sparks a fire.

aṅguṣṭha mātram amalam sphurat puraṭa maulinam apīvya darśanam śyāmam taḍit vāsasam acyutam	He [the Lord] was only thumb high, but He was all transcendental. He had a very beautiful, blackish, infallible body, and He wore a dress of lightning yellow and a helmet of blazing gold. Thus He was seen by the child.
