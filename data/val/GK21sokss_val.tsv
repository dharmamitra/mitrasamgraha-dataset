uttaraṃ tasya śikharaṃ kailāsākhyo mahāgiriḥ / yojanānāṃ sahasrāṇi bahūnyākramya tiṣṭhati // mandaro mathite 'pyabdhau na sudhāsitatāṃ gataḥ / ahaṃ tvayatnāditi yo hasatīva svakāntibhiḥ // carācaragurus tatra nivasatyambikāsakhaḥ / gaṇair vidyādharaiḥ siddhaiḥ sevyamāno maheśvaraḥ // piṅgottuṅgajaṭājūṭagato yasyāśnute navaḥ / saṃdhyāpiśaṅgapūrvādriśṛṅgasaṅgasukhaṃ śaśī //	the northernmost summit thereof is a great peak named Kailāsa, which towers many thousand yojanas in the air,[10] and, as it were, laughs forth with its snowy gleams this boast: “Mount Mandara[11] did not become white as mortar even when the ocean was churned with it, but I have become such without an effort.” There dwells Maheśvara the beloved of Pārvatī, the chief of things animate and inanimate, attended upon by Gaṇas, Vidyādharas and Siddhas.[12] In the upstanding yellow tufts of his matted hair the new moon enjoys the delight of toucing the eastern mountain yellow in the evening twilight.
yenāndhakāsurapaterekasyārpayatā hṛdi / śūlaṃ trijagato 'pyasya hṛdayāccitramuddhṛtam //	When he drove his trident into the heart of Andhaka, the King of the Asuras,[12] though he was only one, the dart which that monarch had infixed in the heart of the three worlds was, strange to say, extracted.
cūḍāmaṇiṣu yatpādanakhāgrapratimāṅkitāḥ / prasadaprāptacandrārdhā iva bhānti surāsurāḥ // taṃ kadācitsamutpannavisrambhā rahasi priyā / stutibhistoṣayāmāsa bhavānīpatimīśvaram //	The image of his toe-nails being reflected in the crest-jewels of the gods and Asuras made them seem as if they had been presented with half moons by his favour.[13] Once on a time that lord, the husband of Pārvatī, was gratified with praises by his wife, having gained confidence as she sat in secret with him;
tasyāḥ stutivacohṛṣṭas tām aṅkam adhiropya saḥ / kiṃ te priyaṃ karomīti babhāṣe śaśiśekharaḥ // tataḥ provāca girijā prasanno 'si yadi prabho / ramyāṃ kāṃcitkathāṃ brūhi devādya mama nūtanām // bhūtaṃ bhavad bhaviṣyad vā kiṃ tat syāj jagati priye / bhavatī yan na jānīyād iti śarvo 'py uvāca tām // tataḥ sa vallabhā tasya nirbandhamakarotprabhoḥ / priyapraṇayahevāki yato mānavatīmanaḥ //	the moon-crested one, attentive to her praise and delighted, placed her on his lap, and said: “What can I do to please thee?” Then the daughter of the mountain spake: “My lord, if thou art satisfied with me, then tell me some delightful story that is quite new.” And Śiva said to her: “What can there be in the world, my beloved, present, past, or future, that thou dost not know?” Then that goddess, beloved of Śiva, importuned him eagerly because she was proud in soul on account of his affection.
tatastaccāṭubuddhyaiva tatprabhāvanibandhanām / tasyāḥ svalpāṃ kathāmevaṃ śivaḥ saṃpratyavarṇayat //	Then Śiva, wishing to flatter her, began by telling her a very short story, referring to her own divine power.
asti māmīkṣituṃ pūrvaṃ brahmā nārāyaṇastathā / mahīṃ bhramantau himavatpādamūlamavāpatuḥ //	“Once on a time[14] Brahmā and Nārāyaṇa,[15] roaming through the world in order to behold me, came to the foot of Himavat.
tato dadṛśatustatra jvālāliṅgaṃ mahatpuraḥ / tasyāntamīkṣituṃ prāyādeka ūrdhvamadho 'paraḥ //	Then they beheld there in front of them a great flame-liṅga[16]; in order to discover the end of it, one of them went up, and the other down;
alabdhāntau tapobhirmāṃ toṣayāmāsatuśca tau / āvirbhūya mayā coktau varaḥ ko 'pyarthyatāmiti // tacchrutvaivābravīdbrahmā putro me 'stu bhavāniti / apūjyastena jāto 'sāvalyāroheṇa ninditaḥ //	and when they could not find the end of it, they proceeded to propitiate me by means of austerities: and I appeared to them and bade them ask for some boon: hearing that Brahmā asked me to become his son;
tato nārāyaṇo devaḥ sa varaṃ mām ayācata / bhūyāsaṃ tava śuśrūṣāparo 'haṃ bhagavanniti // ataḥ śarīrabhūto 'sau mama jātastvadātmanā / yo hi nārāyaṇaḥ sā tvaṃ śaktiḥ śaktimato mama //	on that account he has ceased to be worthy of worship, disgraced by his overweening presumption: “Then that god Nārāyaṇa craved a boon of me, saying: O revered one, may I become devoted to thy service! Then he became incarnate, and was born as mine in thy form; for thou art the same as Nārāyaṇa, the power of me all-powerful.
kiṃ ca me pūrvajāyā tvamityuktavati śaṃkare / kathaṃ te purvajāyāhamiti vakti sma pārvatī // pratyuvāca tato bhargaḥ purā dakṣaprajāpateḥ / devi tvaṃ ca tathānyāśca bahvyo 'jāyanta kanyakāḥ //	“Moreover thou wast my wife in a former birth.” When Śiva had thus spoken, Pārvatī asked: “How can I have been thy wife in a former birth?” Then Śiva answered her: “Long ago to the Prajāpati Dakṣa were born many daughters, and amongst them thou, O goddess! He gave thee in marriage to me, and the others to Dharma and the rest of the gods.
sa mahyaṃ bhavatīṃ prādāddharmādibhyo 'parāśca tāḥ / yajñe kadācidāhūtāstena jāmātaro 'khilāḥ //	Once on a time he invited all his sons-in-law to a sacrifice.
varjitas tv aham evaikas tato 'pṛcchyata sa tvayā / kiṃ na bhartā mamāhūtastvayā tātocyatāmiti //	But I alone was not included in the invitation; thereupon thou didst ask him to tell thee why thy husband was not invited.
kapālamālī bhartā te kathamāhūyatāṃ makhe / ityuvāca giraṃ so 'tha tvatkarṇaviṣasūcikām //	Then he uttered a speech which pierced thy ears like a poisoned needle: ‘Thy husband wears a necklace of skulls;
pāpo 'yam asmāj jātena kiṃ dehena mamāmunā / iti kopātparityaktaṃ śarīraṃ tatpriye tvayā //	how can he be invited to a sacrifice?’ “And then thou, my beloved, didst in anger abandon thy body, exclaiming: ‘This father of mine is a villain;
sa ca dakṣamakhastena manyunā nāśito mayā / tato jātā himādrestvamabdheścandrakalā yathā //	what profit have I then in this carcass sprung from him?’ “And thereupon in wrath I destroyed that sacrifice of Dakṣa.[17] “Then thou wast born as the daughter of the Mount of Snow, as the moon’s digit springs from the sea.
atha smara tuṣārādriṃ tapo 'rthamahamāgataḥ / pitā tvaṃ ca niyuṅkte sma śuśrūṣāyai mamātitheḥ // tārakāntakamatputraprāptaye prahitaḥ suraiḥ / labdhāvakāśo 'vidhyanmāṃ tatra dagdho manobhavaḥ //	and thy father ordered thee to do me service as his guest: and there the God of Love, who had been sent by the gods in order that they might obtain from me a son to oppose Tāraka, was consumed,[18] when endeavouring to pierce me, having obtained a favourable opportunity.
tatastīvreṇa tapasā krīto 'haṃ dhīrayā tvayā / tacca tatsaṃcayāyaiva mayā soḍhaṃ tava priye //	Then I was purchased by thee,[19] the enduring one, with severe austerities, and I accepted this proposal of thine, my beloved, in order that I might add this merit to my stock.[20] Thus it is clear that thou wast my wife in a former birth.
itthaṃ me pūvajāyā tvaṃ kimanyatkathyate tava / ityuktvā virate śaṃbhau devī kopākulābravīt //	“What else shall I tell thee?” Thus Śiva spake, and when he had ceased, the goddess, transported with wrath, exclaimed: “Thou art a deceiver;
dhūrtastvaṃ na kathāṃ hṛdyāṃ kathayasyarthito 'pi san / gaṅgāṃ vahannamansaṃdhyāṃ vijito 'si na kiṃ mama // tac chrutvā pratipede 'sya vihitānunayo haraḥ / kathāṃ kathayituṃ divyāṃ tataḥ kopaṃ mumoca sā //	thou wilt not tell me a pleasing tale even though I ask thee. Do I not know that thou worshippest Sandhyā, and bearest Gaṅgā[21] on thy head?” Hearing that, Śiva proceeded to conciliate her, and promised to tell her a wonderful tale: then she dismissed her anger.
neha kaiścit praveṣṭavyam ity uktena tayā svayam / niruddhe nandinā dvāre haro vaktuṃ pracakrame //	She herself gave the order that no one was to enter where they were; Nandin[22] thereupon kept the door, and Śiva began to speak.
ekāntasukhino devā manuṣyā nityaduḥkhitāḥ / divyamānuṣaceṣṭā tu parabhāge na hāriṇī // vidyādharāṇāṃ caritam atas te varṇayāmy aham / iti devyā haro yāvad vakti tāvad upāgamat // prasādavittakaḥ śaṃbhoḥ puṣpadanto gaṇottamaḥ / nyaṣedhi ca praveśo 'sya nandinā dvāri tiṣṭhatā //	“The gods are supremely blessed, men are ever miserable, the actions of demigods are exceedingly charming, therefore I now proceed to relate to thee the history of the Vidyādharas.” While Śiva was thus speaking to his consort, there arrived a favourite dependent of Śiva’s, Puṣpadanta, best of Gaṇas,[23] and his entrance was forbidden by Nandin, who was guarding the door.
niṣkāraṇaṃ niṣedho 'dya mamāpīti kutūhalāt / alakṣito yogavaśātpraviveśa sa tatkṣaṇāt // praviṣṭaḥ śrūtavānsarvaṃ varṇyamānaṃ pinākinā / vidyādharāṇāṃ saptānāmapūrvaṃ caritādbhutam //	Curious to know why even he had been forbidden to enter at that time without any apparent reason, Puṣpadanta immediately entered, making use of his magic power attained by devotion to prevent his being seen, and when he had thus entered, he heard all the extraordinary and wonderful adventures of the seven Vidyādharas being narrated by the trident-bearing god, and having heard them, he in turn went and narrated them to his wife Jayā;
śrutvātha gatvā bhāryāyai jayāyai so 'pyavarṇayat / ko hi vittaṃ rahasyaṃ vā strīṣu śaknoti gūhitum //	for who can hide wealth or a secret from women? Jayā, the doorkeeper, being filled with wonder, went and recited it in the presence of Pārvatī.
sāpi tadvismayāviṣṭā gatvā girisutāgrataḥ / jagau jayā pratīhārī strīṣu vāksaṃyamaḥ kutaḥ // tataścukopa girijā nāpūrvaṃ varṇitaṃ tvayā / jānāti hi jayāpyetaditi ceśvaramabhyadhāt // praṇidhānādatha jñātvā jagādaivamumāpatiḥ / yogī bhūtvā praviśyedaṃ puṣpadantastadāśṛṇot //	How can women be expected to restrain their speech? And then the daughter of the mountain flew into a passion, and said to her husband: “Thou didst not tell me any extraordinary tale, for Jayā knows it also.” Then the lord of Umā, perceiving the truth by profound meditation, thus spake: “Puṣpadanta, employing the magic power of devotion, entered in where we were, and thus managed to hear it.
jayāyai varṇitaṃ tena ko 'nyo jānāti hi priye / śrutvetyānāyayaddevī puṣpadantamatikrudhā // martyo bhavāvinīteti vihvalaṃ taṃ śaśāpa sā / mālyavantaṃ ca vijñaptiṃ kurvāṇaṃ tatkṛte gaṇam //	no one else knows it, my beloved.” Having heard this, the goddess, exceedingly enraged, caused Puṣpadanta to be summoned, and cursed him, as he stood trembling before her, saying: “Become a mortal, thou disobedient servant.”[24] She cursed also the Gaṇa Mālyavān who presumed to intercede on his behalf.
nipatya pādayostābhyāṃ jayayā saha bodhitā / śāpāntaṃ prati śarvāṇī śanairvacanamabravīt // vindhyāṭavyāṃ kuberasya śāpātprāptaḥ piśācatām / supratīkābhidho yakṣaḥ kāṇabhūtyākhyayā sthitaḥ //	Then the two fell at her feet together with Jayā and entreated her to say when the curse would end, and the wife of Śiva slowly uttered this speech: “A Yakṣa[25] named Supratīka, who has been made a Piśāca[25] by the curse of Kuvera, is residing in the Vindhya forest under the name of Kāṇabhūti.
taṃ dṛṣṭvā saṃsmarañjātiṃ yadā tasmai kathāmimām / puṣpadanta pravaktāsi tadā śāpādvimokṣyase //	When thou shalt see him, and calling to mind thy origin, tell him this tale; then, Puṣpadanta, thou shalt be released from this curse.
kāṇabhūteḥ kathāṃ tāṃ tu yadā śroṣyati mālyavān / kāṇabhūtau tadā bhukte kathāṃ prakhyāpya mokṣyate // ityuktvā śailatanayā vyaramattau ca tatkṣaṇāt / vidyutpuñjāviva gaṇau dṛṣṭanaṣṭau babhūvatuḥ //	And when Mālyavān shall hear this tale from Kāṇabhūti, then Kāṇabhūti shall be released, and thou, Mālyavān, when thou hast published it abroad, shalt be free also.” Having thus spoken, the daughter of the mountain ceased, and immediately these Gaṇas disappeared instantaneously like flashes of lightning.

pāraṃ saṃprāpya vidyānāṃ kṛtvā nandaya mantritām / khinnaḥ samāyayau draṣṭuṃ kadācidvindhyavāsinīm // tapasārādhitā devī svapnādeśena sā ca tam / prāhiṇodvindhyakāntāraṃ kāṇabhūtimavekṣitum //	Having attained perfection in the sciences, and having served Nanda as minister, being wearied out he went once on a time to visit the shrine of Durgā.[1] And that goddess, being pleased with his austerities, ordered him in a dream to repair to the wilds of the Vindhya to behold Kāṇabhūti.

kapāleṣu śmaśāneṣu kasmāddeva ratistava / iti pṛṣṭastato devyā bhagavānidamabravīt // purā kalpakṣaye vṛtte jātaṃ jalamayaṃ jagat / mayā tato vibhidyoruṃ raktabindurnipātitaḥ // jalāntastadabhūdaṇḍaṃ tasmāddvedhākṛtātpumān / niragacchattataḥ sṛṣṭā sargāya prakṛtirmayā //	“The adorable god was asked by Durgā: ‘Whence, my lord, comes thy delight in skulls and burning places?’ “He thereupon gave this answer: “‘Long ago, when all things had been destroyed at the end of a Kalpa, the universe became water: I then cleft my thigh and let fall a drop of blood; that drop falling into the water turned into an egg, from that sprang the Supreme Soul,[4] the Disposer;
tau ca prajāpatīnanyānsṛṣṭavantau prajāśca te / ataḥ pitāmahaḥ proktaḥ sa pumāñjagati priye //	from him proceeded Nature,[5] created by me for the purpose of further creation, and they created the other lords of created beings,[6] and those in turn, the created beings, for which reason, my beloved, the Supreme Soul is called in the world the grandfather.
evaṃ carācaraṃ sṛṣṭvā viśvaṃ darpamagādasau / puruṣas tena mūrdhānam athaitasyāhamacchidam // tato 'nutāpena mayā mahāvratamagṛhyata / ataḥ kapālapāṇitvaṃ śmaśānapriyatā ca me //	Having thus created the world, animate and inanimate, that Spirit became arrogant[7]: thereupon I cut off his head: then, through regret for what I had done, I undertook a difficult vow. So thus it comes to pass that I carry skulls in my hand, and love the places where corpses are burned.
kiṃ caitanme kapālātma jagaddevi kare sthitam / pūrvoktāṇḍakapāle dve rodasī kīrtite yataḥ // ityukte śaṃbhunā tatra śroṣyāmīti sakautuke / sthite mayi tato bhūyaḥ pārvatī patimabhyadhāt //	Moreover, this world, resembling a skull, rests in my hand; for the two skull-shaped halves of the egg beforementioned are called heaven and earth.’[8] When Śiva had thus spoken, I, being full of curiosity, determined to listen;
sa puṣpadantaḥ kiyatā kālenāsmānupaiṣyati / tadākarṇyābravīddevīṃ māmuddiśya maheśvaraḥ // piśāco dṛśyate yo 'yameṣa vaiśravaṇānugaḥ / yakṣo mitramabhūccāsya rakṣaḥ sthūlaśirā iti //	and Pārvatī again said to her husband: ‘After how long a time will that Puṣpadanta return to us?’ Hearing that, Maheśvara spoke to the goddess, pointing me out to her: ‘That Piśāca, whom thou beholdest there, was once a Yakṣa, a servant of Kuvera, the God of Wealth, and he had for a friend a Rākṣasa named Sthūlaśiras;
saṃgataṃ tena pāpena nirīkṣyainaṃ dhanādhipaḥ / vindhyāṭavyāṃ piśācatvamādiśaddhanadeśvaraḥ //	and the Lord of Wealth, perceiving that he associated with that evil one, banished him to the wilds of the Vindhya mountains.
bhrātrāsya dīrghajaṅghena patitvāf pādayostataḥ / śāpāntaṃ prati vijñapto vadati sma dhanādhipaḥ //	But his brother Dīrghajaṅgha fell at the feet of the god, and humbly asked when the curse would end.
śāpāvatīrṇād ākarṇya puṣpadantānmahākathām / uktvā mālyavate tāṃ ca śāpātprāptāya martyatām // tābhyāṃ gaṇābhyāṃ sahitaḥ śāpamenaṃ tariṣyati / itīha dhanadenāsya śāpānto vihitastadā // tvayā ca puṣpadantasya sa eveti smara priye / etacchrutvā vacaḥ śambhoḥ saharṣo 'ham ihāgataḥ //	Then the God of Wealth said: “After thy brother has heard the great tale from Puṣpadanta, who has been born into this world in consequence of a curse, and after he has in turn told it to Mālyavān, who owing to a curse has become a human being, he together with those two Gaṇas shall be released from the effects of the curse.” Such were the terms on which the God of Wealth then ordained that Mālyavān should obtain remission from his curse here below, and thou didst fix the same in the case of Puṣpadanta;
itthaṃ me śāpadoṣo 'yaṃ puṣpadantāgamāvadhiḥ / ity uktvā virate tasmin kāṇabhūtau ca tatkṣaṇam // smṛtvā vararucirjātiṃ suptotthita ivāvadat / sa eva puṣpadanto 'haṃ mattastāṃ ca kathāṃ śṛṇu // ityuktvā granthalakṣāṇi sapta sapta mahākathāḥ / kātyāyanena kathitāḥ kāṇabhūtistato 'bravīt // deva rudrāvatārastvaṃ ko 'nyo vetti kathāmimām / tvatprasādādgataprāyaḥ sa śāpo me śarīrataḥ //	recall it to mind, my beloved.’ When I heard that speech of Śiva, I came here, overjoyed, knowing that the calamity of my curse would be terminated by the arrival of Puṣpadanta.” When Kāṇabhūti ceased after telling this story, that moment Vararuci remembered his origin, and exclaimed like one aroused from sleep: “I am that very Puṣpadanta, hear that tale from me.” Thereupon Kātyāyana related to him the seven great tales in seven hundred thousand verses, and then Kāṇabhūti said to him: “My lord, thou art an incarnation of Śiva, who else knows this story? Through thy favour that curse has almost left my body.
tadbrūhi nijavṛttantaṃ janmanaḥ prabhṛti prabho / māṃ pavitraya bhūyo 'pi na gopyaṃ yadi mādṛśe // tato vararucistasya praṇatasyānurodhataḥ / sarvamājanmavṛttāntaṃ vistarādidamabravīt // kauśāmbyāṃ somadattākhyo nāmnāgniśikha ityapi / dvijo 'bhūttasya bhāryā ca vasudattābhidhābhavat //	Therefore tell me thy own history from thy birth, thou mighty one, sanctify me yet further, if the narrative may be revealed to such a one as I am.” Then Vararuci, to gratify Kāṇabhūti, who remained prostrate before him, told all his history from his birth at full length, in the following words:— In the city of Kauśāmbī there lived a Brāhman called Somadatta, who had also the title of Agniśikha, and his wife was called Vasudattā.
munikanyā ca sā śāpāttasyāṃ jātāvavātarat / tasyāṃ tasmāddvijavarādeṣa jāto 'smi śāpataḥ //	She was the daughter of a hermit, and was born into the world in this position in consequence of a curse; and I was borne by her to this excellent Brāhman, also in consequence of a curse.
tato mamātibālasya pitā pañcatvamāgataḥ / atiṣṭhadvardhayantī tu mātā māṃ kṛcchrakarmabhiḥ //	Now while I was still quite a child my father died, but my mother continued to support me, as I grew up, by severe drudgery;

jijñāsārthamathābhyāṃ me prātiśākhyamapaṭhyata / tathaiva tanmayā sarvaṃ paṭhitaṃ paśyatostayoḥ //	this boy will remember by heart everything that he has heard once.”[9] Then they, in order to test me, recited to me a Prātiśākhya[10];
tatastābhyāṃ samaṃ gatvā dṛṣṭvā nāṭyaṃ tathaiva tat / gṛhametyāgrato mātuḥ samagraṃ darśitaṃ mayā // ekaśrutadharatvena māṃ niścitya kathāmimām / vyāḍināmā tayoreko manmātuḥ praṇato 'bravīt //	immediately I repeated the whole in their presence, then I went with the two Brāhmans and saw that play, and when I came home I went through the whole of it in front of my mother: then one of the Brāhmans, named Vyāḍi, having ascertained that I was able to recollect a thing on hearing it once, told with submissive reverence this tale to my mother.
vetasākhye pure mātardevasvāmikarambhakau / abhūtāṃ bhrātarau viprāvatiprītau parasparam //	Mother, in the city of Vetasa there were two Brāhman brothers, Deva-Svāmin and Karambaka, who loved one another very dearly;
tayorekasya putro 'yamindradatto 'parasya ca / ahaṃ vyāḍiḥ samutpanno matpitāstaṃ gatastataḥ //	this Indradatta here is the son of one of them, and I am the son of the other, and my name is Vyāḍi. It came to pass that my father died.
tacchokādindradattasya pitā yāto mahāpatham / asmajjananyośca tataḥ sphuṭitaṃ hṛdayaṃ śucā //	Owing to grief for his loss, the father of Indradatta went on the long journey,[11] and then the hearts of our two mothers broke with grief;
tenānāthau sati dhane 'py āvāṃ vidyābhikāṅkṣiṇau / gatau prārthayituṃ svāmikumāraṃ tapasā tataḥ //	thereupon, being orphans, though we had wealth,[12] and desiring to acquire learning, we went to the southern region to supplicate the lord Kārttikeya.
tapaḥsthitau ca tatrāvāṃ sa svapne prabhurādiśat / asti pāṭalikaṃ nāma puraṃ nandasya bhūpateḥ // tatrāsti caiko varṣākhyo viprastasmādavāpsyathaḥ / kṛtsnāṃ vidyāmatastatra yuvābhyāṃ gamyatāmiti // athāvāṃ tatpuraṃ yātau pṛcchatostatra cāvayoḥ / astīha mūrkho varṣākhyo vipra ityavadajjanaḥ // tato dolādhirūḍhena gatvā cittena tatkṣaṇam / gṛhamāvāmapaśyāva varṣasya vidhurasthiti //	“There is a city called Pāṭaliputra, the capital of King Nanda, and in it there is a Brāhman, named Varṣa, from him ye shall learn all knowledge, therefore go there.” Then we went to that city, and when we made inquiries there, people said to us: “There is a blockhead of a Brāhman, in this town, of the name of Varṣa.” Immediately we went on with minds in a state of suspense, and we saw the house of Varṣa in a miserable condition, made a very ant-hill by mice, dilapidated by the cracking of the walls, untidy,[13] deprived of eaves, looking like the very birthplace of misery.
tatra dhyānasthitaṃ varṣamālokyābhyantare tadā / upāgatau svas tatpatnīṃ vihitātithyasatkriyām //	Then, seeing Varṣa plunged in meditation within the house, we approached his wife, who showed us all proper hospitality;
dhūsarakṣāmavapuṣaṃ viśīrṇamalināmbarām / guṇarāgāgatāṃ tasya rūpiṇīmiva durgatim //	her body was emaciated and begrimed, her dress tattered and dirty; she looked like the incarnation of Poverty, attracted thither by admiration for the Brāhman’s virtues.
praṇāmapūrvamāvābhyāṃ tasyai so 'tha niveditaḥ / svavṛttāntaśca tadbhartṛmaurkhyavārtā ca yā śrutā //	Bending humbly before her, we told her our circumstances, and the report of her husband’s imbecility, which we had heard in the city.

I will relate the whole story,” and then she, chaste lady, proceeded to tell us the tale which follows:— There lived in this city an excellent Brāhman, named Śaṅkara Svāmin, and he had two sons, my husband Varṣa, and Upavarṣa;
ayaṃ mūrkho daridraśca viparīto 'sya cānujaḥ / tena cāsya niyuktābhūtsvabhāryā gṛhapoṣaṇe // kadācidatha saṃprāptā prāvṛṭ tasyāṃ ca yoṣitaḥ / saguḍaṃ piṣṭaracitaṃ guhyarūpaṃ jugupsitam // kṛtvā mūrkhāya viprāya dadatyeva kṛte hi tāḥ / śītakāle nidāghe ca snānakleśaklamāpaham //	my husband was stupid and poor, and his younger brother was just the opposite: and Upavarṣa appointed his own wife to manage his elder brother’s house.[14] Then in the course of time the rainy season came on, and at this time the women are in the habit of making a cake of flour mixed with molasses, of an unbecoming and disgusting shape, [see notes on cake-making] and giving it to any Brāhman who is thought to be a blockhead, and if they act thus, this cake is said to remove their discomfort caused by bathing in the cold season, and their exhaustion caused by bathing in the hot weather[15];
dattaṃ na pratipadyanta ityācāro hi kutsitaḥ / taddevaragṛhiṇyā me dattamasmai sadakṣiṇam //	but when it is given, Brāhmans refuse to receive it, on the ground that the custom is a disgusting one.
tadgṛhītvāyamāyāto mayā nirbhartsito bhṛśam / mūrkhabhāvakṛtenāntarmanyunā paryatapyata //	This cake was presented by my sister-in-law to my husband, together with a sacrificial fee; he received it, and brought it home with him, and got a severe scolding from me;
tataḥ svāmikumārasya pādamūlaṃ gato 'bhavat / tapastuṣṭena tenāsya sarvā vidyāḥ prakāśitāḥ //	then he began to be inwardly consumed with grief at his own stupidity, and went to worship the sole of the foot of the god Kārttikeya: the god, pleased with his austerities, bestowed on him the knowledge of all the sciences;
sakṛcchrutadharaṃ vipraṃ prāpyaitāstvaṃ prakāśayeḥ / ityādiṣṭaḥ sa tenaiva saharṣo 'yamihāgataḥ //	and gave him this order: “When thou findest a Brāhman who can recollect what he has heard only once, then thou mayest reveal these”—thereupon my husband returned home delighted, and when he had reached home, told the whole story to me.
āgatyaiva ca vṛttāntaṃ sarvaṃ mahyaṃ nyavedayat / tadā prabhṛtyavirataṃ japandhyāyaṃśca tiṣṭhati // ataḥ śrutadharaṃ kaṃcidanviṣyānayataṃ yuvām / tena sarvārthasiddhirvā bhaviṣyati na saṃśayaḥ //	From that time forth he has remained continually muttering prayers and meditating: so find you some one who can remember anything after hearing it once, and bring him here: if you do that, you will both of you undoubtedly obtain all that you desire.
śrutvaitad dharṣapatnītas tūrṇaṃ daurgatyahānaye / dattvā hemaśataṃ cāsyai nirgatau svastataḥ purāt //	Having heard this from the wife of Varṣa, and having immediately given her a hundred gold pieces to relieve her poverty, we went out of that city;
athāvāṃ pṛthivīṃ bhrāntau na ca śrutadharaṃ kvacit / labdhavantau tataḥ śrāntau prāptāvadya gṛhaṃ tava // ekaśrutadharaḥ prāpto bālo 'thaṃ tanayastava / tadenaṃ dehi gacchāvo vidyādraviṇasiddhaye //	then we wandered through the earth, and could not find anywhere a person who could remember what he had heard only once; at last we arrived tired out at your house to-day, and have found here this boy, your son, who can recollect anything after once hearing it: therefore give him us and let us go forth to acquire the commodity knowledge.
iti vyāḍivacaḥ śrutvā manmātā sādarāvadat / sarvaṃ sagmatamevaitadastyatra pratyayo mama // tathāhi pūrvaṃ jāte 'sminn ekaputre mama sphuṭā / gaganādevam udabhūd aśarīrā sarasvatī //	Having heard this speech of Vyāḍi, my mother said with respect: “All this tallies completely: I repose confidence in your tale: for long ago at the birth of this my only son, a distinct spiritual[16] voice was heard from heaven.
eṣa śrutadharo jāto vidyāṃ varṣādavāpsyati / kiṃ ca vyakaraṇaṃ loke pratiṣṭhāṃ prāpayiṣyati // nāmnā vararuciś cāyaṃ tat tad asmai hi rocate / yad yad varaṃ bhavet kiṃcid ity uktvā vāg upāramat //	‘A boy has been born who shall be able to remember what he has heard once; he shall acquire knowledge from Varṣa, and shall make the science of grammar famous in the world, and he shall be called Vararuci by name, because whatever is excellent[17] shall please him.’ Having uttered this, the voice ceased.
ata eva vivṛddhe 'smin bālake cintayāmy aham / kva sa varṣa upādhyāyo bhaved iti divāniśam // adya yuṣmanmukhājjñātvā paritoṣaśca me paraḥ / tadenaṃ nayataṃ bhrātā yuvayoreṣa kā kṣatiḥ // iti manmātṛvacanaṃ śrutvā tau harṣanirbharau / vyāḍīndradattau tāṃ rātrimabudhyetāṃ kṣaṇopamām //	Consequently, ever since this boy has grown big, I have been thinking, day and night, where that teacher Varṣa can be, and to-day I have been exceedingly gratified at hearing it from your mouth. Therefore take him with you: what harm can there be in it, he is your brother?” When they heard this speech of my mother’s, those two, Vyāḍi and Indradatta, overflowing with joy, thought that night but a moment in length.
athotsavārthamambāyāstūrṇaṃ dattva nijaṃ dhanam / vyāḍinaivopanīto 'haṃ vedārhatvaṃ mamecchatā // tato mātrābhyanujñātaṃ kathaṃcidruddhabāṣpayā / māmādāya nijotsāhaśamitāśeṣatadvyatham // manyamānau ca kaumāraṃ puṣpitaṃ tadanugraham / vyāḍīndradattau tarasā nagaryāḥ prasthitau tataḥ //	Then Vyāḍi quickly gave his own wealth to my mother to provide a feast, and desiring that I should be qualified to read the Vedas, invested me with the Brāhmanical thread.[18] Then Vyāḍi and Indradatta took me, who managed by my own fortitude to control the excessive grief I felt at parting, while my mother in taking leave of me could with difficulty suppress her tears, and considering that the favour of Kārttikeya towards them had now put forth blossom, set out rapidly from that city;
atha krameṇa varṣasya vayaṃ prāptā gṛhaṃ guroḥ / skandaprasādamāyāntaṃ mūrtaṃ māṃ so 'yamanyata //	then in course of time we arrived at the house of the teacher Varṣa: he too considered that I was the favour of Kārttikeya arrived in bodily form.
kṛtvāsmānagrato 'nyedyurupaviṣṭaḥ śucau bhuvi / varṣopādhyāya oṃkāramakaroddivyayā girā //	The next day he placed us in front of him, and sitting down in a consecrated spot he began to recite the syllable Om[18] with heavenly voice.
tadanantaramevāsya vedāḥ sāṅgā upasthitāḥ / adhyāpayitumasmāṃśca pravṛtto 'bhūdasau tataḥ //	Immediately the Vedas with the six supplementary sciences rushed into his mind, and then he began to teach them to us;
sakṛcchrutaṃ mayā tatra dviḥśrutaṃ vyāḍinā tathā / triśrutaṃ cendradattena guruṇoktamagṛhyata // dhvanim atha tamapūrvaṃ divyam ākarṇya sadyaḥ sapadi vilasadantarvismayo vipravargaḥ / kim idam iti samantād draṣṭum abhyetya varṣaṃ stutimukharamukhaśrīr arcati sma praṇāmaiḥ //	then I retained what the teacher told us after hearing it once, Vyāḍi after hearing it twice, and Indradatta after hearing it three times: then the Brāhmans of the city, hearing of a sudden that divine sound, came at once from all quarters with wonder stirring in their breasts to see what this new thing might be, and with their reverend mouths loud in his praises, honoured Varṣa with low bows.
kimapi tadavalokya tatra citraṃ pramadavaśānna paraṃ tadopavarṣaḥ / api vitatamahotsavaḥ samagraḥ samajani pāṭaliputrapauralokaḥ //	Then beholding that wonderful miracle, not only Upavarṣa, but all the citizens of Pāṭaliputra[19] kept high festival.

tacchrutvā so 'bravīdasmāñchṛṇutaitatkathāmimām / tīrthaṃ kanakhalaṃ nāma gaṅgādvāre 'sti pāvanam // yatra kāñcanapātena jāhnavī devadantinā / uśīnaragiriprasthādbhittvā samavatāritā // dākṣiṇātyo dvijaḥ kaścit tapasyan bhāryayā saha / tatrāsīt tasya cātraiva jāyante sma trayaḥ sutāḥ //	There is a sanctifying place of pilgrimage, named Kanakhala, at the point where the Ganges issues from the hills,[2] where the sacred stream was brought down from the tableland of Mount Uśīnara by Kāñcanapāta, the elephant of the gods, having cleft it asunder.[3] In that place lived a certain Brāhman from the Deccan, performing austerities in the company of his wife, and to him were born there three sons.
kālena svargate tasminsabhārye te ca tatsutāḥ / sthānaṃ rājagṛhaṃ nāma jagmurvidyārjanecchayā //	In the course of time he and his wife went to heaven, and those sons of his went to a place named Rājagṛha, for the sake of acquiring learning.
tatra cādhītavidyāste trayo 'pyānāthyaduḥkhitāḥ / yayuḥ svāmikumārasya darśane dakṣiṇāpatham //	And having studied the sciences there, the three, grieved at their unprotected condition, went to the Deccan in order to visit the shrine of the god Kārttikeya.
tatra te ciñcinīṃ nāma nagarīm ambudhes taṭe / gatvā bhojikasaṃjñasya viprasya nyavasan gṛhe // sa ca kanyā nijāstisrastebhyo dattvā dhanāni ca / tapase 'nanyasaṃtāno gaṅgāṃ yāti sma bhojikaḥ //	Then they reached a city named Ciñcinī, on the shore of the sea, and dwelt in the house of a Brāhman named Bhojika, and he gave them his three daughters in marriage, and bestowed on them all his wealth, and having no other children, went to the Ganges to perform austerities.
atha teṣāṃ nivasatāṃ tatra śvaśuraveśmani / avagrahakṛtastīvro durbhikṣaḥ samajāyata //	And while they were living there in the house of their father-in-law a terrible famine arose, produced by drought.
tena bhāryāḥ parityajya sādhvīstāste trayo yayuḥ / spṛśanti na nṛśaṃsānāṃ hṛdayaṃ bandhubuddhayaḥ //	Thereupon the three Brāhmans fled, abandoning their virtuous wives (since no care for their families touches the hearts of cruel men).
tatastu madhyamā tāsāṃ sagarbhābhūttataśca tāḥ / bhavanaṃ yajñadattasya pitṛmitrasya śiśriyuḥ //	Then the middle one of the three sisters was found to be pregnant; and those ladies repaired to the house of Yajñadatta, a friend of their father’s;
tatra tasthur nijān bhartṝn dhyāyantyaḥ kliṣṭavṛttayaḥ / āpadyapi satīvṛttaṃ kiṃ muñcanti kulastriyaḥ //	there they remained in a miserable condition, thinking each on her own husband (for even in calamity women of good family do not forget the duties of virtuous wives).
kālena madhyamā cātra tāsāṃ putramasūta sā / anyonyātiśayāttasminsnehaścāsāmavardhata //	Now in the course of time the middle one of the three sisters gave birth to a son, and they all three vied with one another in love towards him.
kadācidvyomamārgeṇa viharantaṃ maheśvaram / aṅkasthā skandajananī taṃ dṛṣṭvā sadayāvadat // deva paśya śiśāv asminn etās tisro 'pi yoṣitaḥ / baddhasnehā dadhatyāśāmeṣo 'smāñjīvayediti //	So it happened once upon a time that, as Śiva was roaming through the air, the mother of Skanda,[4] who was reposing on Śiva’s breast, moved with compassion at seeing their love for their child, said to her husband: “My lord, observe, these three women feel great affection for this boy, and place hope in him, trusting that he may some day support them;
tattathā kuru yenāyametā bālo 'pi jīvayet / ityuktaḥ priyayā devo varadaḥ sa jagāda tām // anugṛhṇāmyamuṃ pūrvaṃ sabhāryeṇāmunā yataḥ / arādhito 'smi tenāyaṃ bhogārthaṃ nirmito bhuvi //	therefore bring it about that he may be able to maintain them, even in his infancy.” Having been thus entreated by his beloved, Śiva, the giver of boons, thus answered her: “I adopt him as my protégé, for in a previous birth he and his wife propitiated me, therefore he has been born on the earth to reap the fruit of his former austerities;
etajjāyā ca sā jātā pāṭalī nāma bhūpateḥ / mahendravarmaṇaḥ putrī bhāryāsyaiva bhaviṣyati // ityuktvā sa vibhuḥ svapne sādhvīstisro jagāda tāḥ / nāmnā putraka evāyaṃ yuṣmākaṃ bālaputrakaḥ //	and his former wife has been born again as Pāṭalī, the daughter of the King Mahendravarman, and she shall be his wife in this birth also.” Having said this, that mighty god told those three virtuous women in a dream: “This young son of yours shall be called Putraka;
asya suptaprabuddhasya śīrṣānte ca dine dine / suvarṇalakṣaṃ bhavitā rājā cāyaṃ bhaviṣyati // tataḥ suptotthite tasmin bāle tāḥ prāpya kāñcanam / yajñadattasutāḥ sādhvyo nananduḥ phalitavratāḥ //	and every day when he awakes from sleep a hundred thousand gold pieces shall be found under his pillow,[5] and at last he shall become a king.” Accordingly, when he woke up from sleep, those virtuous daughters of Yajñadatta found the gold and rejoiced that their vows and prayers had brought forth fruit.
atha tena suvarṇena vṛddhakoṣo 'cireṇa saḥ / babhūva putrako rājā tapodhīnā hi saṃpadaḥ // kadācidyajñadatto 'tha rahaḥ putrakamabravīt / rājandurbhikṣadoṣeṇa kvāpi tepitaro gatāḥ // tatsadā dehi viprebhyo yenāyānti viśamya te / brahmadattakathāṃ caitāṃ kathayāmyatra te śṛṇu // vārāṇasyāmabhūtpūrvaṃ brahmadattābhidho nṛpaḥ / so 'paśyaddhaṃsayugalaṃ prayāntaṃ gagane niśi //	Then by means of that gold Putraka, having in a short time accumulated great treasure, became a king, for good fortune is the result of austerities.[6] Once upon a time Yajñadatta said in private to Putraka: “King, your father and uncles have gone away into the wide world on account of a famine, therefore give continually to Brāhmans, in order that they may hear of it and return: and now listen, I will tell you the story of Brahmadatta: There lived formerly in Benares a king named Brahmadatta. He saw a pair of swans flying in the air at night.
visphuratkanakacchāyaṃ rājahaṃsaśatairvṛtam / vidyutpuñjamivākāṇḍasitābhrapariveṣṭitam //	They shone with the lustre of gleaming gold, and were begirt with hundreds of white swans, and so looked like a sudden flash of lightning surrounded by white clouds.
punastaddarśanotkaṇṭhā tathāsya vavṛdhe tataḥ / yathā nṛpatisaukhyeṣu na babandha ratiṃ kvacit //	And his desire to behold them again kept increasing so mightily that he took no pleasure in the delights of royalty.
mantribhiḥ saha saṃmantrya tataścākārayatsaraḥ / sa rājā svamate kāntaṃ prāṇināṃ cābhayaṃ dadau // tataḥ kālena tau prāptau haṃsau rājā dadarśa saḥ / viśvastau cāpi papraccha haime vapuṣi kāraṇam //	And then, having taken counsel with his ministers, he caused a fair tank to be made according to a design of his own, and gave to all living creatures security from injury. In a short time he perceived that those two swans had settled in that lake, and when they had become tame he asked them the reason of their golden plumage.
vyaktavācau tatastau ca haṃsau rājānamūcatuḥ / purā janmāntare kākāvāvāṃ jātau mahīpate //	And then those swans addressed the king with an articulate voice: “In a former birth, O king, we were born as crows;
balyarthaṃ yudhyamānau ca puṇye śūnye śivālaye / vinipatya vipannau svastatsthānadroṇikāntare // jātau jātismarāvāvāṃ haṃsau hemamayau tataḥ / tacchrutvā tau yathākāmaṃ paśyanrājā tutoṣa saḥ //	and when we were fighting for the remains of the daily offering[8] in a holy empty temple of Śiva we fell down and died within a sacred vessel belonging to that sanctuary, and consequently we have been born as golden swans with a remembrance of our former birth.” Having heard this, the king gazed on them to his heart’s content, and derived great pleasure from watching them.
ato 'nanyādṛśādeva pitṛndānādavāpsyasi / ityukto yajñadattena putrakastattathākarot //	“Therefore you will gain back your father and uncles by an unparalleled gift.” When Yajñadatta had given him this advice, Putraka did as he recommended;
śrutvā pradānavārtāṃ tāmāyayuste dvijātayaḥ / parijñātāḥ parāṃ lakṣmīṃ patnīśca saha lebhire //	when they heard the tidings of the distribution, those Brāhmans arrived; and when they were recognised they had great wealth bestowed on them, and were reunited to their wives.
āścaryamaparityājyo dṛṣṭanaṣṭāpadāmapi / avivekāndhabuddhīnāṃ svānubhāvo durātmanām //	Strange to say, even after they have gone through calamities, wicked men, having their minds blinded by want of discernment, are unable to put off their evil nature.
kālena rājyakāmāste putrakaṃ taṃ jighāṃsavaḥ / ninyustaddarśanavyājāddvijā vindhyanivāsinīm //	After a time they hankered after royal power, and being desirous of murdering Putraka, they enticed him under pretext of a pilgrimage to the temple of Durgā;
vadhakān sthāpayitvā ca devīgarbhagṛhāntare / tam ūcuḥ pūrvam ekas tvaṃ paśya devīṃ vrajāntaram //	and having stationed assassins in the inner sanctuary of the temple, they said to him: “First go and visit the goddess alone.
tataḥ praviṣṭo viśvāsāt sa dṛṣṭvā hantum udyatān / puruṣān putrako 'pṛcchat kasmān nihatha mām iti //	Step inside.” Thereupon he entered boldly, but when he saw those assassins preparing to slay him he asked them why they wished to kill him.
pitṛbhiste prayuktāḥ smaḥ svarṇaṃ dattveti cābruvan / tatas tān mohitān devyā buddhimān putrako 'vadat // dadāmyetadanarghaṃ vo ratnālaṃkaraṇaṃ nijam / māṃ muñcata karomyatra nodbhedaṃ yāmi dūrataḥ //	They replied: “We were hired for gold to do it by your father and uncles.” Then the discreet Putraka said to the assassins, whose senses were bewildered by the goddess: “I will give you this priceless jewelled ornament of mine. Spare me.
evamastviti tattasmādgṛhītvā vadhakā gatāḥ / hataḥ putraka ityūcus tatpitṝṇāṃ puro mṛsā //	I will go to a distant land.” The assassins said, “So be it,” and taking the ornament they departed, and falsely informed the father and uncles of Putraka that he was slain.
tataḥ pratinivṛttāste hatā rājyārthino dvijāḥ / mantribhirdrohiṇo buddhvā kṛtaghnānāṃ śivaṃ kutaḥ // atrāntare sa rājāpi putrakaḥ satyasaṃgaraḥ / viveśa vindhyakāntāraṃ viraktaḥ sveṣu bandhuṣu //	Then those Brāhmans returned and endeavoured to get possession of the throne, but they were put to death by the ministers as traitors. How can the ungrateful prosper? In the meanwhile that King Putraka, faithful to his promise, entered the impassable wilds of the Vindhya, disgusted with his relations.
bhraman dadarśa tatrāsau bāhuyuddhaikatatparau / puruṣau dvau tatastau sa pṛṣṭavān kau yuvām iti //	As he wandered about he saw two heroes engaged heart and soul in a wrestling match and he asked them who they were.
mayāsurasutāvāvāṃ tadīyaṃ cāsti nau dhanam / idaṃ bhājanameṣā ca yaṣṭirete ca pāduke //	They replied: “We are the two sons of the Asura Maya, and his wealth belongs to us, this vessel, and this stick, and these shoes;
etan nimittaṃ yuddhaṃ nau yo balī sa hared iti / etat tadvacanaṃ śrutvā hasan provāca putrakaḥ // kiyadetaddhanaṃ puṃsastatastau samavocatām / pāduke paridhāyaite khecaratvamavāpyate //	it is for these that we are fighting, and whichever of us proves the mightier is to take them.” When he heard this speech of theirs, Putraka said, with a smile: “That is a fine inheritance for a man!” Then they said: “By putting on these shoes one gains the power of flying through the air;
yaṣṭyā yallikhyate kiṃcitsatyaṃ saṃpadyate hi tat / bhājane yo ya āhāraścintyate sa sa tiṣṭhati //	whatever is written with this staff turns out true;
tac chrutvā putrako 'vādīt kiṃ yuddhenāstv ayaṃ paṇaḥ / dhāvan balādhiko yaḥ syāt sa evaitad dhared iti // evamastviti tau mūḍhau dhāvitau so 'pi pāduke / adhyāsyodapatadvyoma gṛhītvā yaṣṭibhājane //	and whatever food a man wishes to have in the vessel is found there immediately.” When he heard this, Putraka said: “What is the use of fighting? Make this agreement, that whoever proves the best man in running shall possess this wealth.” Those simpletons said, “Agreed,” and set off to run, while the prince put on the shoes and flew up in the air, taking with him the staff and the vessel.
atha dūraṃ kṣaṇādgatva dadarśa nagarīṃ śubhām / ākarṣikākhyāṃ tasyāṃ ca nabhaso 'vatatāra saḥ //	Then he went a great distance in a short time and saw beneath him a beautiful city named Ākarṣikā and descended into it from the sky.
vañcanapravaṇā veśyā dvijā matpitaro yathā / vaṇijo dhanalubdhāśca kasya gehe vasāmyaham // iti saṃcintayan prāpa sa rājā vijanaṃ gṛham / jīrṇaṃ tadantare caikāṃ vṛddhāṃ yoṣitam aikṣata //	He reflected with himself: “Courtesans are prone to deceive, Brāhmans are like my father and uncles, and merchants are greedy of wealth; in whose house shall I dwell?” Just at that moment he reached a lonely dilapidated house, and saw a single old woman in it;
pradānapūrvaṃ saṃtoṣya tāṃ vṛddhāmādṛtastayā / uvāsālakṣitastatra putrakaḥ śīrṇasadmani //	so he gratified that old woman with a present, and lived unobserved in that broken-down old house, waited upon respectfully by the old woman.
kadācitsātha saṃprītā vṛddhā putrakamabravīt / cintā me putra yadbhāryā nānurūpā tava kvacit //	Once upon a time the old woman in an affectionate mood said to Putraka: “I am grieved, my son, that you have not a wife meet for you.
iha rājñastu tanayā pāṭalītyasti kanyakā / uparyantaḥpure sā ca ratnamityabhirakṣyate // etadvṛddhāvacastasya dattakarṇasya śṛṇvataḥ / viveśa tenaiva pathā labdharandhro hṛdi smaraḥ //	But here there is a maiden named Pāṭalī, the daughter of the king, and she is preserved like a jewel in the upper story of a seraglio.” While he was listening to this speech of hers with open ear the God of Love found an unguarded point and entered by that very path into his heart.
draṣṭavyā sā mayādyaiva kānteti kṛtaniścayaḥ / niśāyāṃ nabhasā tatra pādukābhyāṃ jagāma saḥ //	He made up his mind that he must see that damsel that very day, and in the night flew up through the air to where she was, by the help of his magic shoes.
praviśya so 'driśṛṅgāgratuṅgavātāyanena tām / antaḥpure dadarśārtha suptāṃ rahasi pāṭalīm // sevyamānāmavirataṃ candrakāntyāṅgalagnayā / jitvā jagadidaṃ śrāntāṃ mūrtāṃ śaktiṃ manobhuvaḥ //	He then entered by a window, which was as high above the ground as the peak of a mountain, and beheld that Pāṭalī, asleep in a secret place in the seraglio, continually bathed in the moonlight that seemed to cling to her limbs: as it were the might of love in fleshly form reposing after the conquest of this world.
kathaṃ prabodhayāmyetāmiti yābadacintayat / ityakasmādvahistāvadyāmikaḥ puruṣo jagau // āliṅgya madhurahuṃkṛtimalasonmiṣadīkṣaṇāṃ rahaḥ kāntām / yadbodhayanti suptāṃ janmani yūnāṃ tadeva phalam // śrutvaivaitadupoddhātamaṅgairutkampaviklavaiḥ / āliliṅga sa tāṃ kāntāṃ prābudhyata tataśca sā //	While he was thinking how he should awake her, suddenly outside a watchman began to chant: “Young men obtain the fruit of their birth when they awake the sleeping one, embracing her as she sweetly scolds, with her eyes languidly opening.” On hearing this encouraging prelude, he embraced that fair one with limbs trembling with excitement, and then she awoke.
paśyantyāstaṃ nṛpaṃ tasyā lajjākautukayordṛśi / abhūdanyonyasaṃmardo racayantyāṃ gatāgatam //	When she beheld that prince, there was a contest between shame and love in her eye, which was alternately fixed on his face and averted.
athālāpe kṛte vṛtte gāndharmodvāhakarmaṇi / avardhata tayoḥ prītirdaṃpatyorna tu yāminī //	When they had conversed together, and gone through the ceremony of the gāndharva marriage,[9] that couple found their love continually increasing as the night waned away.
āmantryātha vadhūmutkāṃ tadgatenaiva cetasā / āyayau paścime bhāge tadvṛddhāveśma putrakaḥ //	Then Putraka took leave of his sorrowing wife, and with his mind dwelling only on her, went in the last watch of the night to the old woman’s house.
itthaṃ pratiniśaṃ tatra kurvāṇe 'smin gatāgatam / saṃbhogacihnaṃ pāṭalyā rakṣibhirdṛṣṭam ekadā //	So every night the prince kept going backwards and forwards, and at last the intrigue was discovered by the guards of the seraglio.
taistadāveditaṃ tasyāḥ pituḥ so 'pi niyuktavān / gūḍhamantaḥpure tatra niśi nārimavekṣitum // tayā ca tasya prāptasya tatrābhijñānasiddhaye / putrakasya prasuptasya nyastaṃ vāsasyalaktakam // prātastayā ca vijñapto rājā cārānvyasarjayat / so 'bhijñānācca taiḥ prāptaḥ putrako jīrṇaveśmani //	Accordingly they revealed the matter to the lady’s father, and he appointed a woman to watch secretly in the seraglio at night. She, finding the prince asleep, made a mark with red lac upon his garment to facilitate his recognition. In the morning she informed the king of what she had done, and he sent out spies in all directions, and Putraka was discovered by the mark and dragged out from the dilapidated house into the presence of the king.
ānīto rājanikaṭaṃ kupitaṃ vīkṣya taṃ nṛpam / pādukābhyāṃ khamutpatya pāṭalīmandire 'viśat //	Seeing that the king was enraged, he flew up into the air with the help of the shoes, and entered the palace of Pāṭalī.
viditau svastaduttiṣṭha gacchāvaḥ pādukāvaśāt / ityaṅke pāṭalīṃ kṛtvā jagāma nabhasā tataḥ // atha gaṅgātaṭanikaṭe gaganādavatīrya sa priyāṃ śrāntām / pātraprabhāvajātairāhārairnandayāmāsa //	He said to her, “We are discovered, therefore rise up, let us escape with the help of the shoes,” and so taking Pāṭalī in his arms he flew away from that place through the air.[10] Then descending from heaven near the bank of the Ganges, he refreshed his weary beloved with cakes provided by means of the magic vessel.
ālokitaprabhāvaḥ pāṭalyā putrako 'rthitaśca tataḥ / yaṣṭyā lilekha tatra sa nagaraṃ caturaṅgabalayuktam // tatra sa rājā bhūtvā mahāprabhāve ca satyatāṃ prāpte / namayitvā taṃ śvaśuraṃ śaśākha pṛthvīṃ samudrāntām //	When Pāṭalī saw the power of Putraka, she made a request to him, in accordance with which he sketched out with the staff a city furnished with a force of all four arms.[11] In that city he established himself as king, and his great power having attained full development, he subdued that father-in-law of his, and became ruler of the sea-engirdled earth.
tadidaṃ divyaṃ nagaraṃ māyāracitaṃ sapauramata eva / nāmnā pāṭaliputraṃ kṣetraṃ lakṣmīsarasvatyoḥ //	This is that same divine city, produced by magic, together with its citizens; hence it bears the name of Pāṭaliputra, and is the home of wealth and learning.
iti varṣamukhādimāmapūrvāṃ vayamākarṇya kathāmatīva citrām / cirakālamabhūma kāṇabhūte vilasadvismayamodamānacittāḥ //	When we heard from the mouth of Varṣa the above strange and extraordinarily marvellous story, our minds, O Kāṇabhūti, were for a long time delighted with thrilling wonder.
iti mahākaviśrīsomadevabhaṭṭaviracite kathāsaritsāgare kathāpīṭhalambake tṛtīyas taraṅgaḥ / caturthas taraṅgaḥ / ityākhyāya kathāṃ madhye vindhyāntaḥ kāṇabhūtaye / punarvararucistasmai prakṛtārthamavarṇayat // evaṃ vyāḍīndradattābhyāṃ saha tatra vasan kramāt / prāpto 'haṃ sarvavidyānāṃ pāramutkrāntaśaiśavaḥ //	[Additional note: “magical articles” motif in folk-lore] [M] (main story line continued) HAVING related this episode to Kāṇabhūti in the Vindhya forest, Vararuci again resumed the main thread of his narrative: While thus dwelling there with Vyāḍi and Indradatta, I gradually attained perfection in all sciences, and emerged from the condition of childhood.
indrotsavaṃ kadācicca prekṣituṃ nirgatā vayam / kanyāmekāmapaśyāma kāmasyāstramasāyakam //	Once on a time when we went out to witness the festival of Indra we saw a maiden looking like some weapon of Kāma, not of the nature of an arrow.
indradatto mayā pṛṣṭastataḥ keyaṃ bhavediti / upavarṣasutā seyamupakośeti so 'bravīt //	Then Indradatta, on my asking him who that lady might be, replied: “She is the daughter of Upavarṣa, and her name is Upakośā”;
sā sakhībhiśca māṃ jñātvā prītipeśalayā dṛśā / karṣantī manmanaḥ kṛcchrādagacchadbhavanaṃ nijam //	and she found out by means of her handmaids who I was, and drawing my soul after her with a glance made tender by love, she with difficulty managed to return to her own house.
pūrṇacandramukhī nīlanīrajottamalocanā / mṛṇālanālalalitabhujā pīnastanojjvalā // kambukaṇṭhī pravālābharadanacchadaśobhinī / smarabhūpatisaundaryamandirevendirāparā //	She had a face like a full moon,[1] and eyes like a blue lotus; she had arms graceful like the stalk of a lotus, and a lovely full[2] bosom; she had a neck marked with three lines like a shell,[3] and magnificent coral lips;
tataḥ kāmaśarāpātanirbhinne hṛdaye na me / niśi tasyāmabhūnnidrā tadvimboṣṭhapipāsayā //	Then my heart was cleft by the stroke of love’s arrow, and I could not sleep that night through my desire to kiss her bimba[4] lip.
kathaṃcillabdhanidro 'hamapaśyaṃ rajanīkṣaye / śuklāmbaradharāṃ divyāṃ striyaṃ sā māmabhāṣata //	Having at last with difficulty gone off to sleep, I saw, at the close of night, a celestial woman in white garments;
pūrvabhāryopakośā te guṇajñā nāparaṃ patim / kaṃcidicchatyataścintā putra kāryatra na tvayā //	she said to me: “Upakośā was thy wife in a former birth; as she appreciated merit, she desires no one but thee; therefore, my son, thou oughtest not to feel anxious about this matter.
ahaṃ sadā śarīrāntarvāsinī te sarasvatī / tvadduḥkhaṃ notsahe draṣṭum ity uktvāntarhitābhavat //	I am Sarasvatī[5] that dwell continually in thy frame, I cannot bear to behold thy grief.” When she had said this she disappeared.
tataḥ prabuddho jātāstho gatvātiṣṭhamahaṃ śanaiḥ / dayitāmandirāsannabālacūtataroradhaḥ // athāgatya samākhyātaṃ tatsakhyā mannibandhanam / udgāḍhamupakośāyā navānaṅgavijṛmbhitam //	Then I woke up and, somewhat encouraged, I went slowly and stood under a young mango-tree near the house of my beloved; then her confidante came and told me of the ardent attachment of Upakośā to me, the result of sudden passion;
tato 'haṃ dviguṇībhūtatāpastāmevamabravam / adattāṃ gurubiḥ svecchamupakośāṃ kathaṃ bhaje // varaṃ hi mṛtyur nākīrtis tatsakhīhṛdayaṃ tava / gurubhiryadi budhyeta tatkadācicchivaṃ bhavet //	then I, with my pain doubled, said to her: “How can I obtain Upakośā unless her natural protectors willingly bestow her upon me? For death is better than dishonour; so if by any means your friend’s heart became known to her parents, perhaps the end might be prosperous.
tadetatkuru bhadre tvaṃ tāṃ sakhīṃ māṃ ca jīvaya / tacchrutvā sā gatā sakhyā mātuḥ sarvaṃ nyavedayat // tayā tatkathitaṃ bhartur upavarṣasya tatkṣaṇam / tena bhrātuśca varṣasya tena taccābhinanditam //	“Therefore bring this about, my good woman: save the life of me and of thy friend.” When she heard this she went and told all to her friend’s mother, she immediately told it to her husband Upavarṣa, he to Varṣa his brother, and Varṣa approved of the match.
vivāhe niścite gatvā vyāḍirānayati sma tām / varṣācāryanideśena kauśāmbyā jananīṃ mama //	Then, my marriage having been determined upon, Vyāḍi, by the order of my tutor, went and brought my mother from Kauśāmbī;
athopakośā vidhivatpitrā me pratipāditā / tato mātrā gṛhiṇyā ca samaṃ tatrāvasaṃ sukham //	so Upakośā was bestowed upon me by her father with all due ceremonies, and I lived happily in Pāṭaliputra with my mother and my wife.
atha kālena varṣasya śiṣyavargo mahānabhūt / tatraikaḥ pāṇinirnāma jaḍabuddhitaro 'bhavat //	Now in course of time Varṣa got a great number of pupils, and among them there was one rather stupid pupil of the name of Pāṇini;
sa śuśrūṣāparikliṣṭaḥ preṣito varṣabhāryayā / agacchattapase khinno vidyākāmo himālayam // tatra tīvreṇa tapasā toṣitādinduśekharāt / sarvavidyāmukhaṃ tena prāptaṃ vyākaraṇaṃ navam //	he, being wearied out with service, was sent away by the preceptor’s wife, and being disgusted at it, and longing for learning, he went to the Himālaya to perform austerities: then he obtained from the god who wears the moon as a crest, propitiated by his severe austerities, a new grammar, the source of all learning.
tataścāgatya māmeva vādāyāhvayate sma saḥ / pravṛtte cāvayorvāde prayātāḥ sapta vāsarāḥ //	Thereupon he came and challenged me to a disputation, and seven days passed away in the course of our disputation;
aṣṭame 'hni mayā tasmiñjite tatsamanantaram / nabhaḥ sthena mahāghoro huṃkāraḥ śaṃbhunā kṛtaḥ //	on the eighth day he had been fairly conquered by me, but immediately afterwards a terrible menacing sound was uttered by Śiva in the firmament;
tena praṇaṣṭam aindraṃ tad asmadvyākaraṇaṃ bhuvi / jitāḥ pāṇininā sarve mūrkhībhūtā vayaṃ punaḥ //	owing to that our Aindra grammar was exploded in the world,[6] and all of us, being conquered by Pāṇini, became accounted fools.
atha saṃjātanirvedaḥ svagṛhasthitaye dhanam / haste hiraṇyaguptasya vidhāya vaṇijo nijam // uktvā taccopakośāyai gatavānasmi śaṃkaram / tapobhirārādhayituṃ nirāhāro himālayam //	Accordingly full of despondency I deposited in the hand of the merchant Hiraṇyadatta my wealth for the maintenance of my house, and after informing Upakośā of it, I went fasting to Mount Himālaya to propitiate Śiva with austerities.
upakośā hi me śreyaḥ kāṅkṣantī nijamandire / atiṣṭhatpratyahaṃ snāntī gaṅgāyāṃ niyatavratā //	Upakośā, on her part anxious for my success, remained in her own house, bathing every day in the Ganges, strictly observing her vow.
ekadā sā madhau prāpte kṣāmā pāṇḍurmanoramā / pratipaccandralekheva janalocanahāriṇī // snātuṃ tripathagāṃ yāntī dṛṣṭā rājapurodhasā / daṇḍādhipatinā caiva kumārasacivena ca //	One day, when spring had come, she, being still beautiful, though thin and slightly pale, and charming to the eyes of men, like the streak of the new moon, was seen by the king’s domestic chaplain while going to bathe in the Ganges, and also by the head magistrate, and by the prince’s minister;
tatkṣaṇātte gatāḥ sarve smarasāyakalakṣyatām / sāpi tasmindine snāntī kathamapyakarocciram //	and immediately they all of them became a target for the arrows of love.
āgacchantīṃ ca sāyaṃ tāṃ kumārasacivo haṭhāt / agrahīdatha sāpyenamavocatpratibhāvatī // abhipretamidaṃ bhadra yathā tava yathā mama / kiṃ tvahaṃ satkulotpannā pravāsasthitabhartṛkā //	It happened too, somehow, that she took a long time bathing that day, and as she was returning in the evening the prince’s minister laid violent hands on her, but she with great presence of mind said to him: “Dear sir, I desire this as much as you, but I am of respectable family, and my husband is away from home.
kathamevaṃ pravarteya paśyet ko'pi kadācana / tataśca dhruvamaśreyastvayā saha bhavenmama //	How can I act thus? Someone might perhaps see us, and then misfortune would befall you as well as me.
tasmānmadhūtsavākṣiptapauraloke gṛhaṃ mama / āgantavaṃ dhruvaṃ rātreḥ prathame prahare tvayā // ityuktvā kṛtasaṃdhā sā tena kṣipta vidhervaśāt / yāvatkiṃcidgatā tāvanniruddhā sā purodhasā //	Therefore you must come without fail to my house in the first watch of the night of the spring festival when the citizens are all excited.”[7] When she had said this, and pledged herself, he let her go, but, as chance would have it, she had not gone many steps farther before she was stopped by the king’s domestic priest.
tasyāpi tatraiva dine tadvadeva tayā niśi / saṃketakaṃ dvitīyasmin prahare paryakalpyata //	She made a similar assignation with him also for the second watch of the same night; and so he too was, though with difficulty, induced to let her go;
atha tasyāpi divase tasminneva tathaiva sā / saṃketakaṃ triyāmāyāṃ tṛtīye prahare vyadhāt // daivāttenāpi nirmuktā sakampā gṛhamāgatā / kartavyāṃ sā svaceṭīnāṃ saṃvidaṃ svairamabravīt // varaṃ patyau pravāsasthe maraṇaṃ kulayoṣitaḥ / na tu rūpāramallokalocanāpātapātratā // iti saṃcintayantī ca smarantī māṃ nināya sā / śocantī svaṃ vapuḥ sādhvī nirāhāraiva tāṃ niśām //	but after she had gone a little farther, up comes a third person, the head magistrate, and detains the trembling lady. Then she made a similar assignation with him too for the third watch of the same night, and having by great good fortune got him to release her, she went home all trembling, and of her own accord told her handmaids the arrangements she had made, reflecting: “Death is better for a woman of good family, when her husband is away, than to meet the eyes of people who lust after beauty.” Full of these thoughts, and regretting me, the virtuous lady spent that night in fasting, lamenting her own beauty.
prātarbrāhmaṇapūjārthaṃ vyasarji vaṇijastayā / ceṭī hiraṇyaguptasya kiṃcinmārgayituṃ dhanam //	Early the next morning she sent a maid-servant to the merchant Hiraṇyagupta to ask for some money in order that she might honour the Brāhmans;
āgatyā so 'pi tāmevamekānte vaṇirābravīt / bhajasva māṃ tato bhartṛsthāpitaṃ te dadāmi tat // tacchrutvā sākṣirahitāṃ matvā bhartṛdhanasthitim / vaṇijaṃ pāpamālokya khedāmarṣakadarthitā // tasyāmevātra saṃketaṃ rātrau tasyāpi paścime / śeṣe pativratā yāme sākarodatha so 'gamat //	then that merchant also came and said to her in private: “Show me love, and then I will give you what your husband deposited.” When she heard that, she reflected that she had no witness to prove the deposit of her husband’s wealth, and perceived that the merchant was a villain, and so, tortured with sorrow and grief, she made a fourth and last assignation with him for the last watch of the same night;
tataḥ sākārayadbhūri ceṭībhiḥ kuṇḍakasthitam / kastūrikādisaṃyuktaṃ kajjalaṃ tailamiśritam // talliptāścelakhaṇḍāśca catvāro vihitāstayā / mañjūṣā kāritā cābhutsthūlā sabahirargalā //	In the meanwhile she had prepared by her handmaids in a large vat lamp-black mixed with oil and scented with musk and other perfumes, and she made ready four pieces of rag anointed with it, and she caused to be made a large trunk with a fastening outside.
atha tasminmahāveṣo vasantotsavavāsare / āyayau prathame yāme kumārasacivo niśi //	So on that day of the spring festival the prince’s minister came in the first watch of the night in gorgeous array.
alakṣitaṃ praviṣṭaṃ tamupakośedamabravīt / asnātaṃ na spṛśāmi tvāṃ tatsnāhi praviśāntaram //	When he had entered without being-observed, Upakośā said to him: “I will not receive you until you have bathed, so go in and bathe.” The simpleton agreed to that, and was taken by the handmaids into a secret dark inner apartment.
aṅgīkurvansa tanmūḍhaśceṭikābhiḥ praveśitaḥ / abhyantaragṛhaṃ guptamandhakāramayaṃ tataḥ // gṛhītvā tatra tasyāntarvastrāṇyābharaṇāni ca / celakhaṇḍaṃ tamekaṃ ca dattvāntarvāsasaḥ kṛte //	There they took off his undergarments and his jewels, and gave him by way of an undergarment a single piece of rag, and they smeared the rascal from head to foot with a thick coating of that lamp-black and oil, pretending it was an unguent, without his detecting it.
atiṣṭhanmardayantyastatpratyaṅgaṃ yāvadasya tāḥ / tāvaddvitīye prahare sa purodhā upāgamat // mittraṃ vararuceḥ prāptaḥ kimapyeṣa purohitaḥ / tadiha praviśetyuktvā ceṭyastāstaṃ tathāvidham // kumārasacivaṃ nagnaṃ mañjūṣāyāṃ sasaṃbhramam / nicikṣipurathābadhnannargalena bahiśca tām //	While they continued rubbing it into every limb the second watch of the night came and the priest arrived. The handmaids thereupon said to the minister: “Here is the king’s priest come, a great friend of Vararuci’s, so creep into this box,” and they bundled him into the trunk just as he was, all naked, with the utmost precipitation; and then they fastened it outside with a bolt.
so 'pi snānamiṣānnītastamasyantaḥ purohitaḥ / tathaiva hṛtavastrādistailakajjalamardanaiḥ // celakhaṇḍadharastāvacceṭikābhirvimohitaḥ / yāvattṛtīye prahare daṇḍādhipatirāgamat //	The priest too was brought inside into the dark room on the pretence of a bath, and was in the same way stripped of his garments and ornaments, and made a fool of by the handmaids by being rubbed with lamp-black and oil, with nothing but the piece of rag on him, until in the third watch the chief magistrate arrived.
tadāgamanajāccaiva ceṭībhiḥ sahasā bhayāt / ādyavatso 'pi nikṣipto mañjūṣāyāṃ purohitaḥ //	The handmaids immediately terrified the priest with the news of his arrival, and pushed him into the trunk like his predecessor.
tasya dattvārgalaṃ tābhiḥ snānavyājāt praveśya saḥ / daṇḍādhipo 'pi tatraiva tāvatkajjalamardanaiḥ // anyavadvipralabdho 'bhūccelakhaṇḍaikakarpaṭaḥ / yāvatsa paścime yāme vaṇiktatrāgato 'bhavat // taddarśanabhayaṃ dattvā kṣipto daṇḍādhipo 'pyatha / mañjūṣāyāṃ sa ceṭībhirdattaṃ ca bahirargalam //	After they had bolted him in, they brought in the magistrate on the pretext of giving him a bath, and so he, like his fellows, with a piece of rag for his only garment, was bamboozled by being continually anointed with lamp-black, until in the last watch of the night the merchant arrived. The handmaids made use of his arrival to alarm the magistrate, and bundled him also into the trunk and fastened it on the outside.
te ca trayo 'ndhatāmisravasabhyāsodyatā iva / mañjūṣāyāṃ bhiyānyonyaṃ sparśaṃ labdhvāpi nālapan //	So those three being shut up inside the box, as if they were bent on accustoming themselves to live in the hell of blind darkness, did not dare to speak on account of fear, though they touched one another.
dattvātha dīpaṃ gehe 'tra vaṇijaṃ taṃ praveśya sā / upakośāvadaddehi tanme bhartrārpitaṃ dhanam // tacchrutvā śūnyamālokya gṛhaṃ so 'pyavadacchaṭhaḥ / uktaṃ mayā dadāmyeva yadbhartrā sthāpitaṃ dhanam // upakośāpi mañjūṣāṃ śrāvayantī tato 'bravīt / etaddhiraṇyaguptasya vacaḥ śṛṇuta devatāḥ // ity uktvā caiva nirvāpya dīpaṃ so 'py anyavadvaṇik / liptaḥ snānāpadeśena ceṭībhiḥ kajjalaiś ciram //	Then Upakośā brought a lamp into the room, and making the merchant enter it, said to him: “Give me that money which my husband deposited with you.” When he heard that, the rascal said, observing that the room was empty: “I told you that I would give you the money your husband deposited with me.” Upakośā, calling the attention of the people in the trunk, said: “Hear, O ye gods, this speech of Hiraṇyagupta.” When she had said this she blew out the light, and the merchant, like the others, on the pretext of a bath, was anointed by the handmaids for a long time with lamp-black.
atha gaccha gatā rātrir ity uktaḥ sa niśākṣaye / anicchan galahastena tābhir nirvāsitas tataḥ //	Then they told him to go, for the darkness was over, and at the close of the night they took him by the neck and pushed him out of the door sorely against his will.
atha cīraikavasano maṣīliptaḥ pade pade / bhakṣyamāṇaḥ śvabhiḥ prāpa lajjamāno nijaṃ gṛham //	Then he made the best of his way home, with only the piece of rag to cover his nakedness, and smeared with the black dye, with the dogs biting him at every step, thoroughly ashamed of himself, and at last reached his own house;
tatra dāsajanasyāpi tāṃ prakṣālayato maṣīm / nāśakatsaṃmukhe sthātuṃ kaṣṭo hyavinayakramaḥ //	and when he got there he did not dare to look his slaves in the face while they were washing off that black dye.
upakośāpy atha prātaś ceṭikānugatā gatā / gurūṇām anivedyaiva rājño nandasya mandiram // vaṇigghiraṇyagupto me bhartrā nyāsīkṛtaṃ dhanam / jihīrṣatīti vijñaptas tatra rājā tayā svayam //	In the early morning Upakośā, accompanied by her handmaids, went, without informing her parents, to the palace of King Nanda, and there she herself stated to the king that the merchant Hiraṇyagupta was endeavouring to deprive her of money deposited with him by her husband.
tena tac ca parijñātuṃ tatraivānāyito vaṇik / maddhaste kiṃcid apy asyā deva nāstīty abhāṣata //	The king, in order to inquire into the matter, immediately had the merchant summoned, who said: “I have nothing in my keeping belonging to this lady.” Upakośā then said: “I have witnesses, my lord;
upakośā tato 'vādītsanti me deva sākṣiṇaḥ / mañjūṣāyāṃ gataḥ kṣiptvā bhartā me gṛhadevatāḥ // svavācā puratastāsāmanenāṅgīkṛtaṃ dhanam / tāmānāyyeha mañjūṣāṃ pṛcchyantāṃ devatāstvayā //	before he went, my husband put the household gods into a box, and this merchant with his own lips admitted the deposit in their presence. Let the box be brought here and ask the gods yourself.” Having heard this, the king in astonishment ordered the box to be brought.
tacchrutvā vismayādrājā tadānayanamādiśat / tataḥ kṣaṇāt sā mañjūṣā prāpitā bahubhirjanaiḥ //	Thereupon in a moment that trunk was carried in by many men.
athopakośā vakti sma satyaṃ vadata devatāḥ / yaduktaṃ vaṇijānena tato yāta nijaṃ gṛham //	Then Upakośā said: “Relate truly, O gods, what that merchant said, and then go to your own houses;
no ceddadāmyahaṃ yuṣmānsadasyudghāṭayāmi vā / tacchrutvā bhītabhītāste mañjūṣāsthā babhāṣire // satyaṃ samakṣam asmākam anenāṅgīkṛtaṃ dhanam / tato niruttaraḥ sarvaṃ sa vaṇik tat prapadyata //	if you do not, I will burn you or open the box in court.” Hearing that, the men in the box, beside themselves with fear, said: “It is true, the merchant admitted the deposit in our presence.” Then the merchant, being utterly confounded, confessed all his guilt;
upakośāmathābhyarthya rājñā tvatikutūhalāt / sadasyudghāṭitā tatra mañjūṣā sphoṭitārgalā // niṣkṛṣṭāste 'pi puruṣāstamaḥ piṇḍā iva trayaḥ / kṛcchrācca pratyabhijñātā mantribhirbhūbhṛtā tathā //	but the king, being unable to restrain his curiosity, after asking permission of Upakośā, opened the chest there in court by breaking the fastening, and those three men were dragged out, looking like three lumps of solid darkness, and were with difficulty recognised by the king and his ministers.
prahasatsvatha sarveṣu kimetaditi kautukāt / rājñā pṛṣṭā satī sarvamupakośā śaśaṃsa tat //	The whole assembly then burst out laughing, and the king in his curiosity asked Upakośā what was the meaning of all this;
acintyaṃ śīlaguptānāṃ caritaṃ kulayoṣitām / iti cābhinanandustāmupakośāṃ sabhāsadaḥ // tatas te hṛtasarvasvāḥ paradāriṣiṇo 'khilāḥ / rājñā nirvāsitā deśādaśīlaṃ kasya bhūtaye //	All present in court expressed their approbation of Upakośā’s conduct, observing: “The virtuous behaviour of women of good family who are protected by their own excellent disposition[8] only, is incredible.” Then all those coveters of their neighbour’s wife were deprived of all their living, and banished from the country.
bhaginī me tvamityuktvā dattvā prītyā dhanaṃ bahu / upakośāpi bhūpena preṣitā gṛhamāgamat //	Who prospers by immorality? Upakośā was dismissed by the king, who showed his great regard for her by a present of much wealth, and said to her: “Henceforth thou art my sister”; and so she returned home.
varṣopavarṣau tadbuddhvā sādhvīṃ tāmabhyanandatām / sarvaśca vismayasmeraḥ pure tatrābhavajjanaḥ //	Varṣa and Upavarṣa, when they heard it, congratulated that chaste lady, and there was a smile of admiration on the face of every single person in that city.
atrāntare tuṣārādrau kṛtvā tīvrataraṃ tapaḥ / ārādhito mayā devo varadaḥ pārvatīpatiḥ //	In the meanwhile, by performing a very severe penance on the snowy mountain, I propitiated the god, the husband of Pārvatī, the great giver of all good things;
tadeva tena śāstraṃ me pāṇinīyaṃ prakāśitam / tadicchānugrahādeva mayā pūrṇīkṛtaṃ ca tat //	he revealed to me that same treatise of Pāṇini;
tato 'haṃ gṛham āgaccham ajñātādhvapariśramaḥ / niśākarakalāmauliprasādāmṛtanirbharaḥ //	and in accordance with his wish I completed it: then I returned home without feeling the fatigue of the journey, full of the nectar of the favour of that god who wears on his crest a digit of the moon;
atha mātur gurūṇāṃ ca kṛtapādābhivandanaḥ / tatropakośāvṛttāntaṃ tam aśrauṣaṃ mahādbhutam // tena me paramāṃ bhūmimātmanyānandavismayau / tasyāṃ ca sahajasnehabahumānāvagacchatām //	then I worshipped the feet of my mother and of my spiritual teachers, and heard from them the wonderful achievement of Upakośā; thereupon joy and astonishment swelled to the upmost height in my breast, together with natural affection and great respect for my wife.
varṣo 'tha manmukhādaicchacchrotuṃ vyākaraṇaṃ navam / tataḥ prakāśitaṃ svāmikumāreṇaiva tasya tat // tato vyāḍīndradattābhyāṃ vijñapto dakṣiṇāṃ prati / gururvarṣo 'bravīt svarṇakoṭir me dīyatām iti // aṅgīkṛtya gurorvākyaṃ tau ca māmityavocatām / ehi rājñaḥ sakhe nandādyācituṃ gurudakṣiṇām //	Now Varṣa expressed a desire to hear from my lips the new grammar, and thereupon the god Kārttikeya himself revealed it to him. And it came to pass that Vyāḍi and Indradatta asked their preceptor Varṣa what fee they should give him. He replied: “Give me ten millions of gold pieces.” So they, consenting to the preceptor’s demand, said to me: “Come with us, friend, to ask the King Nanda to give us the sum required for our teacher’s fee;
gacchāmo nānyato 'smābhiriyatkāñcanamāpyate / navādhikāyā navateḥ koṭīnāmadhipo hi saḥ // vācā tenopakośā ca prāgdharmabhaginī kṛtā / ataḥ śyālaḥ sa te kiṃcittvadguṇaiḥ samavāpyate //	we cannot obtain so much gold from any other quarter: for he possesses nine hundred and ninety millions, and so long ago he declared your wife Upakośā his sister in the faith, therefore you are his brother-in-law;
iti niścitya nandasya bhūpateḥ kaṭakaṃ vayam / ayodhyāsthamagacchāma trayaḥ sabrahmacāriṇaḥ // prāptamātreṣu cāsmāsu sa rājā pañcatāṃ gataḥ / rāṣṭre kolāhalaṃ jātaṃ viṣādena sahaiva naḥ //	we shall obtain something for the sake of your virtues.” Having formed this resolution, we three fellow-students[9] went to the camp of King Nanda in Ayodhyā, and the very moment we arrived the king died; accordingly an outburst of lamentation arose in the kingdom, and we were reduced to despair.
avocadindradatto 'tha tatkṣaṇaṃ yogasiddhimān / gatāsorasya bhūpasya śarīraṃ praviśāmyaham //	Immediately Indradatta, who was an adept in magic, said: “I will enter the body of this dead king [see notes on the entering of another’s body];
arthī vararucirme 'stu dāsyāmyasmai ca kāñcanam / vyāḍī rakṣatu me dehaṃ tataḥ pratyāgamāvadhi // ityuktvā nandadehāntarindradattaḥ samāviśat / pratyujjīvati bhūpe ca rāṣṭre tatrotsavo 'bhavat //	let Vararuci prefer the petition to me, and I will give him the gold, and let Vyāḍi guard my body until I return.” Saying this, Indradatta entered into the body of King Nanda, and when the king came to life again there was great rejoicing in the kingdom.
śūnye devagṛhe dehamindradattasya rakṣitum / vyāḍau sthite gato 'bhūvamahaṃ rājakulaṃ tadā //	While Vyāḍi remained in an empty temple to guard the body of Indradatta, I went to the king’s palace.
praviśya svastikāraṃ ca vidhāya gurudakṣiṇām / yoganando mayā tatra hemakoṭiṃ sa yācitaḥ //	I entered, and, after making the usual salutation, I asked the supposed Nanda for ten million gold pieces as my instructor’s fee.
tataḥ sa śakaṭālākhyaṃ satyanandasya mantriṇam / suvarṇakoṭimetasmai dāpayeti samādiśat //	Then he ordered a man named Śakatāla,[10] the minister of the real Nanda, to give me ten million of gold pieces.
mṛtasya jīvitaṃ dṛṣṭvā sadyaśca prāptimarthinaḥ / sa tattvaṃ jñātavānmantrī kimajñeyaṃ hi dhīmatām //	That minister, when he saw that the dead king had come to life, and that the petitioner immediately got what he asked, guessed the real state of the case.
deva dīyata ityuktvā sa ca mantrītyacintayat / nandasya tanayo bālo rājyaṃ ca bahuśatrumat // tatsaṃpratyatra rakṣāmi tasya dehamapīdṛśam / niścityaitatsa tatkālaṃ śavānsarvānadāhayat // cārairanviṣya tanmadhye labdhvā devagṛhāttataḥ / vyāḍiṃ vidhūya taddagdhamindradattakalevaram //	What is there that the wise cannot understand? That minister said: “It shall be given, your Highness,” and reflected with himself: “Nanda’s son is but a child, and our realm is menaced by many enemies, so I will do my best for the present to keep his body on the throne even in its present state.” Having resolved on this, he immediately took steps to have all dead bodies burned, employing spies to discover them, and among them was found the body of Indradatta, which was burned after Vyāḍi had been hustled out of the temple.
atrāntare ca rājānaṃ hemakoṭisamarpaṇe / tvaramāṇamathāha sma śakaṭālo vicārayan // utsavākṣiptacitto 'yaṃ sarvaḥ parijanaḥ sthitaḥ / kṣaṇaṃ pratīkṣatāmeṣa vipro yāvaddadāmyaham //	In the meanwhile the king was pressing for the payment of the money, but Śakatāla, who was still in doubt, said to him: “All the servants have got their heads turned by the public rejoicing, let the Brāhman wait a moment until I can give it.” Then Vyāḍi came and complained aloud in the presence of the supposed Nanda: “Help, help;
athaitya yoganandasya vyāḍinā kranditaṃ puraḥ / abrahmaṇyamanutkrāntajīvo yogasthito dvijaḥ // anāthaśava ityadya balāddagdhastavodaye / tacchrutvā yoganandasya kāpyavasthābhavacchucā //	a Brāhman engaged in magic, whose life had not yet come to an end in a natural way, has been burnt by force on the pretext that his body was untenanted, and this in the very moment of your good fortune.”[11] On hearing this the supposed Nanda was in an indescribable state of distraction from grief;
dehadāhātsthire tasmiñjāte nirgatya me dadau / suvarṇakoṭiṃ sa tataḥ śakaṭālo mahāmatiḥ //	but as soon as Indradatta was imprisoned in the body of Nanda, beyond the possibility of escape, by the burning of his body, the discreet Śakatāla went out and gave me that ten millions.
yoganando 'tha vijane saśoko vyāḍimabravīt / śūdrībhūto 'smi vipro 'pi kiṃ śriyā sthirayāpi me //	Then the supposed Nanda,[12] full of grief, said in secret to Vyāḍi: “Though a Brāhman by birth, I have become a Śūdra.
tacchrutvāśvāsya taṃ vyāḍiḥ kālocitamabhāṣata / jñāto 'si śakaṭālena tadenaṃ cintayādhunā // mahāmantrī hyayaṃ svecchamacirāttvāṃ vināśayet / pūrvanandasutaṃ kuryāc candraguptaṃ hi bhūmipam //	What is the use of my royal fortune to me though it be firmly established?” When he heard that, Vyāḍi comforted him,[13] and gave him seasonable advice: “You have been discovered by Śakatāla, so you must henceforth be on your guard against him, for he is a great minister, and in a short time he will, when it suits his purpose, destroy you, and will make Candragupta, the son of the previous Nanda, king.
tasmādvararuciṃ mantrimukhyatve kuru yena te / etadbuddhyā bhavedrājyaṃ sthiraṃ divyānubhāvayā // ityuktaiva gate vyāḍau dātuṃ tāṃ gurudakṣiṇām / tadaivānīya dattā me yoganandena mantritā //	Therefore immediately appoint Vararuci your minister, in order that your rule may be firmly established by the help of his intellect, which is of god-like acuteness.” When he had said this, Vyāḍi departed to give that fee to his preceptor, and immediately Yogananda sent for me and made me his minister.
athoktaḥ sa mayā rājā brāhmaṇye hārite 'pi te / rājyaṃ naiva sthiraṃ manye śakaṭāle padasthite // tasmānnāśaya yuktyainamiti mantre mayodite / yoganando 'ndhakūpāntaḥ śakaṭālaṃ tamakṣipat // kiṃ ca putraśataṃ tasya tatraiva kṣiptavānasau / jīvandvijo 'munā dagdha iti doṣānukīrtanāt //	Then I said to the king: “Though your estate as a Brāhman has been taken from you, I do not consider your throne secure as long as Śakatāla remains in office, therefore destroy him by some stratagem.” When I had given him this advice, Yogananda threw Śakatāla into a dark dungeon,[14] and his hundred sons with him, proclaiming as his crime that he had burnt a Brāhman alive.
ekaḥ śarāvaḥ saktūnāmekaḥ pratyahamambhasaḥ / śakaṭālasya tatrāntaḥ saputrasya nyadhīyata // sa covāca tataḥ putrānamībhiḥ saktubhiḥ sutāḥ / eko 'pi kṛcchrād varteta bahūnāṃ tu kathaiva kā //	One porringer of barley-meal and one of water was placed inside the dungeon every day for Śakatāla and his sons, and thereupon he said to them: “My sons, even one man alone would with difficulty subsist on this barley-meal, much less can a number of people do so.
tasmātsaṃbhakṣayatvekaḥ pratyahaṃ sajalānamūn / yaḥ śakto yoganandasya kartuṃ vairapratikriyām // tvameva śakto bhuṅkṣvaitaditi putrāstamabruvan / prāṇebhyo 'pi hi dhīrāṇāṃ priyā śatrupratikriyā //	Therefore let that one of us who is able to take vengeance on Yogananda consume every day the barley-meal and the water.” His sons answered him: “You alone are able to punish him, therefore do you consume them.” For vengeance is dearer to the resolute than life itself.
tataḥ sa śakaṭālastaiḥ pratyahaṃ saktuvāribhiḥ / eka evākarod vṛttiṃ kaṣṭaṃ krūrā jigīṣavaḥ //	So Śakatāla alone subsisted on that meal and water every day.

Śakatāla, in the dark dungeon, beholding the death agonies of his starving sons, thought to himself: “A man who desires his own welfare should not act in an arbitrary manner towards the powerful without fathoming their character and acquiring their confidence.” Accordingly his hundred sons perished before his eyes, and he alone remained alive, surrounded by their skeletons.
yoganandaśca sāmrājye baddhamūlo 'bhavattataḥ / vyāḍirabhyāyayau taṃ ca gurave dattadakṣiṇaḥ // abhyetyaiva ca so 'vādīcciraṃ rājyaṃ sakhe 'stu te / āmantrito si gacchāmi tapastaptumahaṃ kvacit // tacchrutvā yoganandastaṃ bāṣpakaṇṭho 'pyabhāṣata / rājye me bhuṅkṣva bhogāṃstvaṃ bhuktvā māṃ mā sma gā iti //	And Vyāḍi approached him after giving the present to his teacher, and after coming near to him said: “May thy rule, my friend, last long! I take my leave of thee. I go to perform austerities somewhere.” Hearing that, Yogananda, with his voice choked with tears, said to him: “Stop thou and enjoy pleasure in my kingdom; do not go and desert me.” Vyāḍi answered: “King! life comes to an end in a moment.
vyāḍis tato 'vadad rājañ śarīre kṣaṇanaśvare / evaṃprāyeṣv asāreṣu dhīmān ko nāma majjati // nahi mohayati prājñaṃ lakṣmīrmarumarīcikā / ityuktvaiva sa tatkālaṃ tapase niścito yayau //	What wise man, I pray you, drowns himself in these hollow and fleeting enjoyments? Prosperity, a desert mirage, does not turn the head of the wise man.” Saying this he went away that moment, resolved to mortify his flesh with austerities.
agamad atha yoganandaḥ pāṭaliputraṃ svarājanagaraṃ saḥ / bhogāya kāṇabhūte matsahitaḥ sakalasainyayutaḥ //	Then that Yogananda went to his metropolis, Pāṭaliputra, for the purpose of enjoyment, accompanied by me, and surrounded with his whole army.
tatropakośāparicaryamāṇaḥ samudvahanmantridhurāṃ ca tasya / ahaṃ jananyā gurubhiś ca sākam āsādya lakṣmīmavasaṃ cirāya //	So I, having attained prosperity, lived for a long time in that state, waited upon by Upakośā, and bearing the burden of the office of prime minister to that king, accompanied by my mother and my preceptors.
bahu tatra dine dine dyusindhuḥ kanakaṃ mahyamadāttapaḥ prasannā / vadati sma śarīriṇī ca sākṣān mama kāryāṇi sarasvatī sadaiva //	There the Ganges, propitiated by my austerities, gave me every day much wealth, and Sarasvatī, present in bodily form, told me continually what measures to adopt.

acintayaṃ tataścāhaṃ rājā tāvadviśṛṅkhalaḥ / tatkāryacintayākrāntaḥ svadharmo me 'vasīdati // tasmādvaraṃ sahāyaṃ taṃ śakaṭālaṃ samuddhare / kriyetā cedviruddhaṃ ca kiṃ da kuryānmayi sthite // niścityaitanmayābhyarthya rājānaṃ so 'ndhakūpataḥ / uddhṛtaḥ śakaṭālo 'tha mṛdavo hi dvijātayaḥ //	Whom will not a sudden access of prosperity intoxicate? Then I reflected with myself: “The king has burst all bonds, and my own religious duties are neglected, being interfered with by my care for his affairs, therefore it is better for me to draw out that Śakatāla from his dungeon and make him my colleague in the ministry; even if he tries to oppose me, what harm can he do as long as I am in office?” Having resolved on this, I asked permission of the king, and drew Śakatāla out of the deep dungeon.
durjayo yoganando 'yaṃ sthite vararucāvataḥ / āśraye vaitasīṃ vṛttiṃ kālaṃ tāvatpratīkṣitum // iti saṃcintya sa prājñaḥ śakaṭālo madicchayā / akarodrājakāryāṇi punaḥ saṃprāpya mantritām //	Now the discreet Śakatāla made up his mind that it would be difficult to overthrow Yogananda as long as I was in office, and that he had accordingly better imitate the cane which bends with the current, and watch a favourable moment for vengeance, so at my request he resumed the office of minister and managed the king’s affairs.
kadācidyoganando 'tha nirgato nagarādvahiḥ / śliṣyatpañcāṅguliṃ hastaṃ gaṅgāmadhye vyalokayat //	Once on a time Yogananda went outside the city, and beheld in the middle of the Ganges a hand, the five fingers of which were closely pressed together.
kimetaditi papraccha māmāhūya sa tatkṣaṇam / ahaṃ ca dve nijāṅgulyau diśi tasyāmadarśayam //	That moment he summoned me and said: “What does this mean?” But I displayed two of my fingers in the direction of the hand.
tena tasmiṃstirobhūte haste rājātivismayāt / bhūyo 'pi tadapṛcchanmāṃ tataścāhaṃ tamabravam // pañcabhirmilitaiḥ kiṃ yajjagatīha na sādhyate / ityuktavānasau hastaḥ śvāṅgulīḥ pañca darśayan // tato 'sya rājan naṅgulyāv ete dve darśite mayā / aikacitye dvayoreva kimasādhyaṃ bhavediti // ityukte gūḍhavijñāne samatuṣyattato nṛpaḥ / śakaṭālo vyaṣīdacca madbuddhiṃ vīkṣya durjayām //	Thereupon that hand disappeared, and the king, exceedingly astonished, again asked me what this meant, and I answered him: “That hand meant to say, by showing its five fingers: ‘What cannot five men united effect in this world?’ Then I, king, showed it these two fingers, wishing to indicate that nothing is impossible when even two men are of one mind.” When I uttered this solution of the riddle the king was delighted, and Śakatāla was despondent, seeing that my intellect would be difficult to circumvent.[1] One day Yogananda saw his queen leaning out of the window and asking questions of a Brāhman guest that was looking up.
tanmātrādeva kupito rājā viprasa tasya saḥ / ādiśadbadhamīrṣyā hi vivekaparipanthinī //	That trivial circumstance threw the king into a passion, and he gave orders that the Brāhman should be put to death for jealousy interferes with discernment.
hantuṃ vadhyabhuvaṃ tasmin nīyamāne dvije tadā / ahasadgatajīvo 'pi matsyo vipaṇimadhyagaḥ //	Then as that Brāhman was being led off to the place of execution in order that he might be put to death, a fish in the market laughed aloud, though it was dead.
tadaiva rājā tadbuddhvā vadhaṃ tasya nyavārayat / viprasya māmapṛcchacca matsyahāsasya kāraṇam //	[also see notes on the motif of laughter] The king hearing it immediately prohibited for the present the execution of that Brāhman, and asked me the reason why the fish laughed.
nirūpya kathayāmyetadityuktvā nirgataṃ ca mām / cintitopasthitaikānte sarasvatyevamabravīt // asya tālataroḥ pṛṣṭhe tiṣṭha rātrābalakṣitaḥ / atra śroṣyasi matsyasya hāsahetum asaṃśayam // tacchrutvā niśi tatrāhaṃ gatvā tālopari sthitaḥ / apaśyaṃ rākṣasīṃ ghorāṃ bālaiḥ putraiḥ sahāgatam //	and after I had gone out Sarasvatī came to me secretly on my thinking of her and gave me this advice: “Take up a position on the top of this palm-tree at night so as not to be observed, and thou shalt without doubt hear the reason why the fish laughed.” Hearing this I went at night to that very place, and ensconced myself on the top of the palm-tree, and saw a terrible female Rākṣasa[2] coming past with her children;
sā bhakṣyaṃ yācamānāṃstānavādītpratipālyatām / prātarvo vipramāṃsāni dāsyāmyadya hato na saḥ //	when they asked her for food, she said: “Wait, and I will give you to-morrow morning the flesh of a Brāhman;
kasmātsa na hato 'dyeti pṛṣṭā tairabravītpunaḥ / taṃ hi dṛṣṭva mṛto 'pīha matsyo hasitavāniti // hasitaṃ kimu teneti pṛṣṭā bhūyaḥ sutaiśca sā / avocadrākṣasī rājñaḥ sarvā rājño 'pi viplutāḥ // sarvatrāntaḥpure hyatra strīrūpāḥ puruṣāḥ sthitāḥ / hanyate 'naparādhas tu vipra ity ahasat timiḥ //	he was not killed to-day.”[3] They said to their mother: “Why was he not killed today?” Then she replied: “He was not executed because a fish in the town, though dead, laughed when it saw him.” The sons said: “Why did the fish laugh?” She continued: “The fish, of course, said to himself: ‘All the king’s wives are dissolute, for in every part of this harem there are men dressed up as women, and nevertheless while these escape an innocent Brāhman is to be put todeath,’ and this tickled the fish so that he laughed.
bhūtānāṃ pārthivātyarthanirvivekatvahāsinām / sarvāntaścāriṇāṃ hyetā bhavantyeva ca vikriyāḥ // etattasyā vacaḥ śrutvā tato 'pakrāntavāhanam / prāptaśca matsyahāsasya hetuṃ rājñe nyavedayam //	For demons assume these disguises, insinuating themselves into everything, and laughing at the exceeding want of discernment of kings.” After I had heard that speech of the female Rākṣasa I went away from thence, and in the morning I informed the king why the fish laughed.
prāpya cāntaḥpurebhyas tān strīrūpān puruṣāṃs tataḥ / bahv amanyata māṃ rājā vadhādvipraṃ ca muktavān //	The king, after detecting in the harem those men clothed as women, looked upon me with great respect, and released that Brāhman from the sentence of death.
ityādi ceṣṭitaṃ dṛṣṭvā tasya rājño viśṛṅkhalam / khinne mayi kadācicca tatrāgāccitrakṛnnavaḥ //	I was disgusted by seeing this and other lawless proceedings on the part of the king, and while I was in this frame of mind there came to the Court a new painter.
alikhat sa mahādevīṃ yoganandaṃ ca taṃ paṭe / sajīvam iva taccitraṃ vākceṣṭārahitaṃ tv abhūt //	He painted on a sheet of canvas the principal queen and Yogananda, and that picture of his looked as if it were alive; it only lacked speech and motion.
taṃ ca citrakaraṃ rājā tuṣṭo vittairapūrayat / taṃ ca vāsagṛhe citrapaṭaṃ bhittāvakārayat //	And the king, being delighted, loaded that painter with wealth, and had the painting set up on a wall in his private apartments.
ekadā ca praviṣṭasya vāsake tatra sā mama / saṃpūrṇalakṣaṇā devī pratibhāti sma citragā //	Now one day when I entered into the king’s private apartments it occurred to me that the painting of the queen did not represent all her auspicious marks;
lakṣaṇāntarasaṃbandhādabhyūhya pratibhāvaśāt / athākārṣamahaṃ tasyāstilakaṃ mekhalāpade //	from the arrangement of the other marks I conjectured by means of my acuteness that there ought to be a spot where the girdle comes, and I painted one there.
saṃpūrṇalakṣaṇāṃ tena kṛtvaināṃ gatavānaham / praviṣṭo yoganando 'tha tilakaṃ taṃ vyalokayat //	Then I departed after thus giving the queen all her lucky marks. Then Yogananda entered and saw that spot, and asked his chamberlains who had painted it.
kenāyaṃ racito 'treti so 'pṛcchacca mahattarān / te ca nyavedayaṃstasmai kartāraṃ tilakasya mām //	And they indicated me as the person who had painted it.
devyā guptapradeśasthamimaṃ nānyo mayā vinā / vetti tajjñātavānevamasau vararuciḥ katham // channaḥ kṛto 'munā nūnaṃ mamāntaḥpuraviplavaḥ / dṛṣṭavānata evāyaṃ strīrūpāṃstatra tānnarān // iti saṃcintayāmāsa yoganandaḥ krudhā jvalan / jāyante bata mūḍhānāṃ saṃvāda api tādṛśāḥ // tataḥ svairaṃ samāhūya śakaṭālaṃ samādiśat / tvayā vararucirvadhyo devīvidhvaṃsanāditi // yathā jñāpayasītyuktvā śakaṭālo 'gamadbahiḥ / acintayacca śaktiḥ syāddhantuṃ vararuciṃ na me //	Yogananda thus reflected while burning with anger: “No one except myself knows of that spot, which is in a part of the queen’s body usually concealed, then how can this Vararuci have come thus to know it?[4] No doubt he has secretly corrupted my harem, and this is how he came to see there those men disguised as women.” Foolish men often find such coincidences.[5] Then of his own motion he summoned Śakatāla, and gave him the following order:— “You must put Vararuci to death for seducing the queen.” Śakatāla said: “Your Majesty’s orders shall be executed,” and went out of the palace, reflecting: “I should not have power to put Vararuci to death, for he possesses god-like force of intellect;
divyabuddhiprabhāvo 'sābuddhartā ca mamāpadaḥ / viprasya tadvaraṃ guptaṃ saṃprati svīkaromi tam //	and he delivered me from calamity; moreover he is a Brāhman;

nahi hantumahaṃ śakyo rākṣaso mittramasti me / dhyātamātrāgato viśvaṃ grasate sa madicchayā //	for I cannot be slain, since I have a Rākṣasa to friend, and he will come, on being only thought of, and at my request will devour the whole world.
rājā tvihendradattākhyaḥ sakhā vadhyo na me dvijaḥ / tacchrutvā so 'bravīnmantrī rakṣo me darśyatāmiti //	As for this king, he is a friend of mine, being a Brāhman named Indradatta, and he ought not to be slain.” Hearing this, that minister said: “Show me the Rākṣasa.” Then I showed him that Rākṣasa who came with a thought;
tato dhyātāgataṃ tasmi tadrakṣo 'hamadarśayam / taddarśanācca vitrasto vismitaśca vabhūva saḥ //	and on beholding him Śakatāla was astonished and terrified.
rakṣasyantarhite tasmiñ śakaṭālaḥ sa māṃ punaḥ / kathaṃ te rākṣaso mittraṃ saṃjāta iti pṛṣṭavān // tato 'hamavadaṃ pūrvaṃ rakṣārthaṃ nagare bhraman / rātrau rātrau kṣayaṃ prāpadekaiko nagarādhipaḥ //	And when the Rākṣasa had disappeared Śakatāla again asked me: “How did the Rākṣasa become your friend?” Then I said: “Long ago the heads of the police, as they went through the city night after night on inspecting duty, perished one by one.
tacchrutvā yoganando māmakaronnagarādhipam / bhramaṃścāpaśyamatrāhaṃ bhramantaṃ rākṣasaṃ niśi // sa ca māmavadadbrūhi vidyate nagare 'tra kā / surūpā strīti tacchrutvā vihasyāhaṃ tamabravam // yā yasyābhimatā mūrkha surūpā tasya sā bhavet / tacchrutvaiva tvayaikena jito 'smītyavadatsa mām //	On hearing that, Yogananda made me head of the police, and as I was on my rounds at night I saw a Rākṣasa roaming about, and he said to me: ‘Tell me, who is considered the best-looking woman in this city?’ When I heard that I burst out laughing, and said: ‘You fool, any woman is good-looking to the man who admires her.’ Hearing my answer, he said: ‘You are the only man that has beaten me.’ And now that I had escaped death by solving his riddle,[7] he again said to me: ‘I am pleased with you;
praśnamokṣādvadhottirṇaṃ māṃ punaścābravīdasau / tuṣṭo 'smīti suhṛnme tvaṃ saṃnidhāsye ca te smṛtaḥ //	henceforth you are my friend, and I will appear to you when you call me to mind.’ Thus he spoke and disappeared, and I returned by the way that I came.

stutibhistoṣitā sā ca mayā devī tirodadhe / babhūva śakaṭālaśca sahāyaḥ praṇato mayi //	And that goddess disappeared when she had been gratified by me with hymns of praise. But Śakatāla became from henceforth my obedient ally.

Do you not know that the minds of kings are most undiscerning, and in a short time you will be cleared from all imputations?[8] In proof of which listen to the following tale:— There reigned here long ago a king named Ādityavarman, and he had a very wise minister, named Śivavarman.
rājñastasyaikadā caikā rājñī garbhamadhārayat / tadbuddhvā sa nṛpo 'pṛcchadityantaḥ purarakṣiṇaḥ // varṣadvayaṃ praviṣṭasya vartate 'ntaḥpure 'tra me / tadeṣā garbhasaṃbhūtiḥ kutaḥ saṃprati kathyatām // athocuste praveśo 'tra puṃso 'nyasyāsti na prabho / śivavarmā tu te mantrī praviśatyanivāritaḥ // tacchrutvācintayadrājā nūnaṃ drohī sa eva me / prakāśaṃ ca hate tasminnapavādo bhavenmama // ityālocya sa taṃ yuktyā śivavarmāṇamīśvaraḥ / sāmantasyāntikaṃ sakhyuḥ prāhiṇodbhogavarmaṇaḥ //	Now it came to pass that one of that king’s queens became pregnant, and when he found it out, the king said to the guards of the harem: “It is now two years since I entered this place, then how has this queen become pregnant? Tell me.” Then they said: “No man except your minister Śivavarman is allowed to enter here, but he enters without any restriction.” When he heard that, the king thought: “Surely he is guilty of treason against me, and yet if I put him to death publicly I shall incur reproach.” Thus reflecting, that king sent that Śivavarman on some pretext to Bhogavarman, a neighbouring chief,[9] who was an ally of his, and immediately afterwards the king secretly sent off a messenger to the same chief, bearing a letter by which he was ordered to put the minister to death.[10] When a week had elapsed after the minister’s departure, that queen tried to escape out of fear, and was taken by the guards with a man in woman’s attire.
ādityavarmā tadbuddhvā sānutāpo 'bhavattadā / kiṃ mayā tādṛśo mantrī ghātito 'kāraṇāditi //	Then Ādityavarman when he heard of it was filled with remorse, and asked himself why he had causelessly brought about the death of so excellent a minister.
atrāntare sa ca prāpa nikaṭaṃ bhogavarmaṇaḥ / śivavarmā sa copāgāllekhamādāya pūruṣaḥ // vācayitvā ca taṃ lekhamekānte śivavarmaṇe / śaśaṃsa vadhanirdeśaṃ bhogavarmā vidhervaśāt //	In the meanwhile Śivavarman reached the Court of Bhogavarman, and that messenger came bringing the letter; and fate would have it so that after Bhogavarman had read the letter he told to Śivavarman in secret the order he had received to put him to death.
śivavarmāpy avocat taṃ sāmantaṃ mantrisattamaḥ / tvaṃ vyāpādaya māṃ no cen nihanmyātmānam ātmanā // tacchrutvā vismayāviṣṭo bhogavarmā jagāda tam / kimetadbrūhi me vipra śāpito 'si na vakṣi cet //	The excellent minister Śivavarman in his turn said to that chief: “Put me to death; if you do not, I will slay myself with my own hand.” When he heard that, Bhogavarman was filled with wonder, and said to him: “What does all this mean? Tell me, Brāhman;
atha vakti sma taṃ mantrī hanyeyaṃ yatra bhūpate / tatra dvādaśa varṣāṇi deśe devo na varṣati // tacchrutvā mantribhiḥ sārdhaṃ bhogavarmā vyacintayat / duṣṭaḥ sa rājā deśasya nāśamasmākamicchati // kiṃ hi tatra na santyeva vadhakā guptagāminaḥ / tasmānmantrī na vadhyo 'sau rakṣyaḥ svātmavadhādapi //	if you do not, you will lie under my curse.” Then the minister said to him: “King, in whatever land I am slain, on that land God will not send rain for twelve years.” When he heard that, Bhogavarman debated with his minister: “That wicked king desires the destruction of our land, for could he not have employed secret assassins to kill his minister? So we must not put this minister to death.
iti saṃmantrya dattvā ca rakṣakān bhogavarmaṇā / śivavarmā tato deśāt preṣito 'bhūt tataḥ kṣaṇāt //	Moreover, we must prevent him from laying violent hands on himself.” Having thus deliberated and appointed him guards, Bhogavarman sent Śivavarman out of his country that moment;
evaṃ pratyāyayau jīvansa mantrī prajñayā svayā / śuddhiścāsyānyato jātā nahi dharmo 'nyathā bhavet //	so that minister by means of his wisdom returned alive, and his innocence was established from another quarter, for righteousness cannot be undone.
itthaṃ tavāpi śuddhiḥ syāttiṣṭha tāvadgṛhe mama / kātyāyana nṛpo 'pyeṣa sānutāpo bhaviṣyati //	In the same way your innocence will be made clear, Kātyāyana[11]; remain for a while in my house; this king too will repent of what he has done.
ityuktaḥ śakaṭālena cchanno 'haṃ tasya veśmani / pratīkṣamāṇo 'vasaraṃ tānyahānyatyavāhayam //	When Śakatāla said this to me, I spent those days concealed in his house.
tasyātha yoganandasya kāṇabhūteḥ kadācana / putro hiraṇyaguptākhyo mṛgayāyai gato 'bhavat // aśvavegātprayātasya kathaṃciddūramantaram / ekākino vane tasya vāsaraḥ paryahīyata //	Then it came to pass that one day, O Kāṇabhūti, a son of that Yogananda named Hiraṇyagupta went out hunting, and when he had somehow or other been carried to a great distance by the speed of his horse, while he was alone in the wood, the day came to an end;
tataśca tāṃ niśāṃ netuṃ vṛkṣamārohati sma saḥ / kṣaṇāttatraiva cārohadṛkṣaḥ siṃhena bhīṣitaḥ //	and then he ascended a tree to pass the night. Immediately afterwards a bear, which had been terrified by a lion, ascended the same tree;
sa dṛṣṭvā rājaputraṃ taṃ bhītaṃ mānuṣabhāṣayā / mā bhaiṣīrmama mittraṃ tvamityuktvā nirbhayaṃ vyadhāt //	he seeing the prince frightened, said to him with a human voice: “Fear not, thou art my friend,” and thus promised him immunity from harm.
visrambhādṛkṣavākyena rājaputro 'tha suptavān / ṛkṣastu jāgradevāsīdadhaḥ siṃho 'tha so 'bravīt //	Then the prince, confiding in the bear’s promise, went to sleep, while the bear remained awake.
ṛkṣaṃ mānuṣametaṃ me kṣipa yāvadvrajāmyaham / ṛkṣastato 'bravītpāpa na mitraṃ ghātayāmyaham // kramādṛkṣe prasupte ca rājaputre ca jāgrati / punaḥ siṃho 'bravīdetamṛkṣaṃ me kṣipa mānuṣa // tacchrutvātmabhayāttena siṃhasyārādhanāya saḥ / kṣipto 'pi nāpataccitramṛkṣo daivaprabodhitaḥ //	Then the lion below said to the bear: “Bear, throw me down this man and I will go away.” Then the bear said: “Villain, I will not cause the death of a friend.” When in course of time the bear went to sleep while the prince was awake, the lion said again: “Man, throw me down the bear.” When he heard that, the prince, who through fear for his own safety wished to propitiate the lion, tried to throw down the bear, but, wonderful to say, it did not fall, since fate caused it to awake.
mittradrohin bhavonmatta iti śāpam adāc ca saḥ / tasya rājasutasyaitadvṛttāntāvagamāvadhim //	And then that bear said to the prince: “Become insane, thou betrayer of thy friend,”[12] laying upon him a curse destined not to end until a third person guessed the whole transaction.
prāpyaiva svagṛhaṃ prātarunmatto 'bhūnnṛpātmajaḥ / yoganandaśca taddṛṣṭvā viṣādaṃ sahasāgamat //	Accordingly the prince, when he reached his palace in the morning, went out of his mind, and Yogananda seeing it was immediately plunged in despondency, and said;
abravīcca sa kāle 'smiñ jīved vararucir yadi / idaṃ jñāyeta tatsarvaṃ dhiṅ me tadvadhapāṭavam //	“If Vararuci were alive at this moment all this matter would be known;
tacchrutvā vacanaṃ rājñaḥ śakaṭālo vyacintayat / hanta kātyāyanasyāyaṃ labdhaḥ kālaḥ prakāśane // na so 'tra mānī tiṣṭheca rājā mayi ca viśvaset / ityālocya sa rājānamabravīdyācitābhayaḥ //	curse on my readiness to have him put to death!” Śakatāla, when he heard this exclamation of the king’s, thought to himself: “Ha! here is an opportunity obtained for bringing Kātyāyana out of concealment, and he, being a proud man, will not remain here, and the king will repose confidence in me.” After reflecting thus, he implored pardon, and said to the king: “O King, cease from despondency;
rājannalaṃ viṣādena jīvanvararuciḥ sthitaḥ / yoganandastato 'vādīddrutamānīyatāmiti // athāhaṃ śakaṭālena yoganandāntikaṃ haṭhāt / ānītas taṃ tathābhūtaṃ rājaputraṃ vyalokayam //	Vararuci remains alive.” Then Yogananda said: “Let him be brought quickly.” Then I was suddenly brought by Śakatāla into the presence of Yogananda and beheld the prince in that state;
mittradrohaḥ kṛto 'nena devetyuktvā tathaiva saḥ / sarasvatīprasādena vṛttāntaḥ kathito mayā // tatastacchāpamuktena stuto 'haṃ rājasūnunā / tvayā kathamidaṃ jñātamityapṛcchatsa bhūpatiḥ //	and by the favour of Sarasvatl I was enabled to reveal the whole occurrence; and I said: “King, he has proved a traitor to his friend.” Then I was praised by that prince who was delivered from his curse; and the king asked me how I had managed to find out what had taken place.
athāham avadaṃ rājaṃl lakṣaṇair anumānataḥ / pratibhātaśca paśyanti sarvaṃ prajñāvatāṃ dhiyaḥ //	Then I said: “King, the minds of the wise see everything by inference from signs, and by acuteness of intellect.
tadyathā tilako jñātastathā sarvamidaṃ mayā / iti madvacanātso 'bhūdrājā lajjānutāpavān //	So I found out all this in the same way as I found out that mole.” When I had said this, that king was afflicted with shame.
athānādṛtasatkāraḥ pariśuddhyaiva lābhavān / svagṛhaṃ gatavānasmi śīlaṃ hi viduṣāṃ dhanam //	Then, without accepting his munificence, considering myself to have gained all I desired by the clearing of my reputation, I went home; for to the wise character is wealth.
prāptasyaiva ca tatratyo jano 'rodītpuro mama / abhyetya māṃ samudbhrāntamupavarṣo 'bravīttataḥ // rājā hataṃ niśamya tvāmupakośāgnisādvapuḥ / akarodatha mātuste śucā hṛdayamasphuṭat // tac chrutvābhinavodbhūtaśokāvegavicetanaḥ / sadyo 'ham apataṃ bhūmau vātarugṇa iva drumaḥ //	And the moment I arrived the servants of my house wept before me, and when I was distressed at it Upavarṣa came to me and said: “Upakośā, when she heard that the king had put you to death, committed her body to the flames,[13] and then your mother’s heart broke with grief.” Hearing that, senseless with the distraction produced by recently aroused grief, I suddenly fell on the ground like a tree broken by the wind; and in a moment I tasted the relief of loud lamentations.
kṣaṇācca gatavānasmi pralāpānāṃ rasajñatām / priyabandhuvināśotthaḥ śokāgniḥ kaṃ na tāpayet // ā saṃsāraṃ jagatyasminnekā nityā hyanityatā / tadetāmaiśvarīṃ māyāṃ kiṃ jānannapi muhyasi // ityādibhir upāgatya varṣeṇa vacanair aham / bodhito 'tha yathātattvaṃ kathaṃciddhṛtimāptavān //	Whom will not the fire of grief, produced by the loss of dear relations, scorch? Varṣa came and gave me sound advice in such words as these: “The only thing that is stable in this ever-changeful world is instability; then why are you distracted though you know this delusion of the Creator?” By the help of these and similar exhortations I at length, though with difficulty, regained my equanimity;
tato viraktahṛdayastyaktvā sarvaṃ nibandhanam / praśamaikasahāyo 'haṃ tapovanamaśiśriyam //	then, with heart disgusted with the world, I flung aside all earthly lords and, choosing self-restraint for my only companion, I went to a grove where asceticism was practised.
divaseṣvatha gacchatsu tattapovanamekadā / ayodhyāta upāgacchadvipra eko mayi sthite //	Then, as days went by, once on a time a Brāhman from Ayodhyā came to that ascetic grove while I was there.
sa mayā yoganandasya rājyavārtām apṛcchyata / pratyabhijñāya māṃ so 'tha saśokamidamabravīt // śṛṇu nandasya yadvṛttaṃ tatsakāśādgate tvayi / labdhvāvakāśas tatrābhūc chakaṭālaś cireṇa saḥ //	I asked him for tidings about Yogananda’s government, and he recognising me told me in sorrowful accents the following story:— “Hear what happened to Nanda after you had left him. Śakatāla, after waiting for it a long time, found that he had now obtained an opportunity of injuring him.
sa cintayanvadhopāyaṃ yoganandasya yuktitaḥ / kṣitiṃ khanantamadrākṣīccāṇakyākhyaṃ dvijaṃ pathi //	While thinking how he might by some device get Yogananda killed, he happened to see a Brāhman named Cāṇakya digging up the earth in his path.
kiṃ bhuvaṃ khanasītyukte tena vipro 'tha so 'bravīt / darbhamunmūlayāmyatra pādo hyetena me kṣataḥ // tacchrutvā sahasā mantrī kopanaṃ krūraniścayam / taṃ vipraṃ yoganandasya vadhopāyamamanyata // nāma pṛṣṭvābravīttaṃ ca he brahmandāpayāmi te / ahaṃ trayodaśīśrāddhaṃ gṛhe nandasya bhūpateḥ //	He said to him: ‘Why are you digging up the earth?’ The Brāhman whom he had asked said: ‘I am rooting up a plant of darbha grass here because it has pricked my foot.[14] When he heard that, the minister thought that Brāhman who formed such stern resolves out of anger would be the best instrument to destroy Nanda with.’ After asking his name he said to him: ‘Brāhman, I assign to you the duty of presiding at a śrāddha [also see notes on śrāddha] on the thirteenth day of the lunar fortnight, in the house of King Nanda;
dakṣiṇātaḥ suvarṇasya lakṣaṃ tava bhaviṣyati / bhokṣyase dhuri cānyeṣāmehi tāvadgṛhaṃ mama //	you shall have one hundred thousand gold pieces by way of fee, and you shall sit at the board above all others;
ityuktvā śakaṭālastaṃ cāṇakyamanayadgṛham / śrāddhāhe 'darśayattaṃ ca rājñe sa śraddadhe ca tam //	in the meanwhile come to my house.’ Saying this, Śakatāla took that Brāhman to his house, and on the day of the śrāddha he showed the Brāhman to the king, and he approved of him.
tataḥ sa gatvā cāṇakyo dhuri śrāddha upāviśat / subandhunāmā vipraśca tāmaicchaddhuramātmanaḥ //	Then Cāṇakya went and sat at the head of the table during the śrāddha, but a Brāhman named Subandhu desired that post of honour for himself.
tadgatvā śakaṭālena vijñapto nandabhūpatiḥ / avādīnnāparo yogyaḥ subandhurdhuri tiṣṭhatu // āgatyaitāṃ ca rājājñāṃ śakaṭālo bhayānataḥ / na me 'parādha ityuktvā cāṇakyāya nyavedayat // so 'tha kopena cāṇakyo jvalanniva samantataḥ / nijāṃ muktvā śikhāṃ tatra pratijñāmakarodimām // avaśyaṃ hanta nando 'yaṃ saptabhirdivasairmayā / vināśyo bandhanīyā ca tato nirbhanyunā śikhā //	Then Śakatāla went and referred the matter to King Nanda, who answered: ‘Let Subandhu sit at the head of the table; no one else deserves the place.’ Then Śakatāla went and, humbly bowing through fear, communicated that order of the king’s to Cāṇakya, adding: ‘It is not my fault.’ Then that Cāṇakya, being, as it were, inflamed all over with wrath, undoing the lock of hair on the crown of his head, made this solemn vow: ‘Surely this Nanda must be destroyed by me within seven days, and then my anger being appeased I will bind up my lock.’[15] When he had said this, Yogananda was enraged;
ityuktavantaṃ kupite yoganande palāyitam / alakṣitaṃ svagehe taṃ śakaṭālo nyaveśayat //	so Cāṇakya escaped unobserved and Śakatāla gave him refuge in his house.
tatropakaraṇe datte guptaṃ tenaiva mantriṇā / sa cāṇakyo dvijaḥ kvāpi gatvā kṛtyāmasādhayat //	Then, being supplied by Śakatāla with the necessary instruments, that Brāhman Cāṇakya went somewhere and performed a magic rite;
tadvaśādyoganando 'tha dāhajvaramavāpya saḥ / saptame divase prāpte pañcatvaṃ samupāgamat //	in consequence of this rite Yogananda caught a burning fever, and died when the seventh day arrived;
hatvā hiraṇyaguptaṃ ca śakaṭālena tatsutam / pūrvanandasute lakṣmīścandragupte niveśitā //	and Śakatāla, having slain Nanda’s son Hiraṇyagupta, bestowed the royal dignity upon Candragupta, a son of the previous Nanda.
mantritve tasya cābhyarthya bṛhaspatisamaṃ dhiyā / cāṇakyaṃ sthāpayitvā taṃ sa mantrī kṛtakṛtyatām // manvāno yoganandasya kṛtavairapratikriyaḥ / putraśokena nirviṇṇaḥ praviveśa mahadvanam // iti tasya mukhācchrutvā viprasya sutarāmaham / kāṇabhūte gataḥ khedaṃ sarvamālokya cañcalam //	And after he had requested Cāṇakya, equal in ability to Bṛhaspati,[16] to be Candragupta’s prime minister and established him in the office, that minister, considering that all his objects had been accomplished, as he had wreaked his vengeance on Yogananda, despondent through sorrow for the death of his sons, retired to the forest.”[17] After I had heard this, O Kāṇabhūti, from the mouth of that Brāhman, I became exceedingly afflicted, seeing that all things are unstable;
khedāc cāham imāṃ draṣṭum āgato vindhyavāsinīm / tatprasādena dṛṣṭvā tvāṃ smṛtā jātirmayā sakhe //	and on account of my affliction I came to visit this shrine of Durgā, and through her favour having beheld you, O my friend, I have remembered my former birth.
prāptaṃ divyaṃ ca vijñānaṃ mayoktā te mahākathā / idānīṃ kṣīṇaśāpo 'haṃ yatiṣye dehamujjhitum //	And having obtained divine discernment I have told you the great tale. Now, as my curse has spent its strength, I will strive to leave the body;
tvaṃ ca saṃprati tiṣṭheha yāvadāyāti te 'ntikam / śiṣyayukto guṇāḍhyākhyastyaktabhāṣātrayo dvijaḥ // so 'pi hyahamiva krodhāddevyā śapto gaṇottamaḥ / mālyavānnāma matpakṣapātī martyatvamāgataḥ //	and do you remain here for the present, until there comes to you a Brāhman named Guṇāḍhya, who has forsaken the use of three languages,[18] surrounded with his pupils, for he like myself was cursed by the goddess in anger, being an excellent Gaṇa, Mālyavān by name, who for taking my part has become a mortal.
tasmai maheśvaroktaiṣā kathanīyā mahākathā / tataste śāpanirmuktistasya cāpi bhaviṣyati //	To him you must tell this tale originally told by Śiva, then you shall be delivered from your curse, and so shall he.
evaṃ vararucistatra kāṇabhūternivedya saḥ / pratasthe dehamokṣāya puṇyaṃ badarikāśramam //	[M] (main story line continued) Having said all this to Kāṇabhūti, that Vararuci set forth for the holy hermitage of Badarikā in order to put off his body.
gacchandadarśa gaṅgāyāṃ so 'tha śākāśinaṃ munim / tatsamakṣaṃ ca tasyarṣeḥ kuśenābhūtkarakṣatiḥ //	As he was going along he beheld on the banks of the Ganges a vegetable-eating[19] hermit, and while he was looking on, that hermit’s hand was pricked with kuśa grass.
tato 'sya rudhiraṃ niryattena śākarasīkṛtam / ahaṃkāraparīkṣārthaṃ kautukātsvaprabhāvataḥ //	Then Vararuci turned his blood, as it flowed out, into sap[20] through his magic power, out of curiosity, in order to test his egotism;
taddṛṣṭvā hanta siddho 'smītyagāddarpamasau muniḥ / tato vararuciḥ kiṃcidvihasyeva jagāda tam //	on beholding that, the hermit exclaimed: “Ha! I have attained perfection”; and so he became puffed up with pride.
jijñāsanāya raktaṃ te mayā śākarasīkṛtam / yāvannādyāpyahaṃkāraḥ parityaktastvayā mune //	Then Vararuci laughed a little and said to him: “I turned your blood into sap in order to test you, because even now, O hermit, you have not abandoned egotism.
jñānamārge hyahaṃkāraḥ parigho duratikramaḥ / jñānaṃ vinā ca nāstyeva mokṣo vrataśatairapi //	Egotism is in truth an obstacle in the road to knowledge hard to overcome, and without knowledge liberation cannot be attained even by a hundred vows.
svargastu na mumukṣūṇāṃ kṣayī cittaṃ vilobhayet / tasmādahaṃkṛtityāgājjñāne yatnaṃ mune kuru //	But the perishable joys of Svarga cannot attract the hearts of those who long for liberation;

Then Vararuci, having consumed his body by that form of meditation, reached his own heavenly home;
iti mahākaviśrīsomadevabhaṭṭaviracite kathāsaritsāgare kathāpīṭhalambake pañcamas taraṅgaḥ / ṣaṣṭhas taraṅgaḥ / tataḥ sa martyavapuṣā mālyavānvicaranvane / nāmnā guṇāḍhaḥ sevitvā sātavāhanabhūpatim // saṃskṛtādyāstadagre ca bhāṣāstisraḥ pratijñayā / tyaktvā khinnamanā draṣṭumāyayau vindhyavāsinīm //	and henceforth that Kāṇabhūti remained in the Vindhya forest, eager for his desired meeting with Guṇāḍhya. [M] (main story line continued) THEN that Mālyavān wandering about in the wood in human form, passing under the name of Guṇāḍhya, having served the King Sātavāhana, and having, in accordance with a vow, abandoned in his presence the use of Sanskrit and two other languages, with sorrowful mind came to pay a visit to Durgā, the dweller in the Vindhya hills;
tadādeśena gatvā ca kāṇabhūtiṃ dadarśa saḥ / tato jātiṃ nijāṃ smṛtvā prabuddhaḥ sahasābhavat //	and by her orders he went and beheld Kāṇabhūti. Then he remembered his origin and suddenly, as it were, awoke from sleep;
āśritya bhāṣāṃ paiśācīṃ bhāṣātrayavilakṣaṇām / śrāvayitvā nijaṃ nāma kāṇabhūtiṃ ca so 'bravīt // puṣpadantācchrutāṃ divyāṃ śīghraṃ kathaya me kathām / yena śāpaṃ tariṣyāvas tvaṃ cāhaṃ ca samaṃ sakhe // tacchrutvā praṇato hṛṣṭaḥ kāṇabhūtiruvāca tam / kathayāmi kathāṃ kiṃ tu kautukaṃ me mahatprabho //	and making use of the Paiśācha language, which was different from the three languages he had sworn to forsake, he said to Kāṇabhūti, after telling him his own name: “Quickly tell me that tale which you heard from Puṣpadanta, in order that you and I together, my friend, may escape from our curse.” Hearing that, Kāṇabhūti bowed before him, and said to him in joyful mood: “I will tell you the story, but great curiosity possesses me, my lord;
ājanmacaritaṃ tāvacchaṃsa me kurvanugraham / iti tenārthito vaktuṃ guṇāḍhyo 'tha pracakrame //	do me this favour.” Thus being entreated by him, Guṇāḍhya proceeded to relate as follows:— In Pratiṣṭhāna[1] there is a city named Supratiṣṭhita;
vatsaś ca gulmakaś caiva tasya dvau tanayau sakhe / jāyete sma tṛtīyā ca śrutārthā nāma kanyakā // kālena brāhmaṇaḥ so 'tha sabhāryaḥ pañcatāṃ gataḥ / tatputrau tau svasāraṃ tāṃ pālayantāvatiṣṭhatām //	in it there dwelt once upon a time an excellent Brāhman named Somaśarman, and he, my friend, had two sons, Vatsa and Gulma, and he had also born to him a third child, a daughter named Śrutārthā. Now in course of time that Brāhman and his wife died, and those two sons of his remained, taking care of their sister.
sā cākasmātsagarbhābhūttadṛṣṭvā vatsagulmayoḥ / tatrānyapuruṣābhāvācchaṅkānyonyamajāyata // tataḥ śrutārthā cittajñā bhrātarau tāvabhāṣata / pāpaśaṅkā na kartavyā śṛṇutaṃ kathayāmi vām //	And she suddenly became pregnant. Then Vatsa and Gulma began to suspect one another, because no other man came in their sister’s way: thereupon Śrutārthā, who saw what was in their minds, said to those brothers: “Do not entertain evil suspicions: listen, I will tell you the truth.
kumāraḥ kīrtisenākhyo nāgarājasya vāsukeḥ / bhrātuḥ putro 'sti tenāhaṃ dṛṣṭā snātuṃ gatā satī //	There is a prince of the name of Kīrtisena, brother’s son to Vāsuki, the king of the Nāgas[2];
tataḥ sa madanākrānto nivedyānvayanāmanī / gāndharveṇa vivāhena māṃ bhāryāmakarottadā //	he saw me when I was going to bathe, thereupon he was overcome with love, and after telling me his lineage and his name, made me his wife by the gāndharva marriage[3];
viprajāterayaṃ tasmānmama garbha iti svasuḥ / śrutvā kaḥ pratyayo 'treti vatsagulmāvavocatām // tato rahasi sasmāra sā taṃ nāgakumārakam / smṛtamātrāgataḥ so 'tha vatsagulmāvabhāṣata // bhāryā kṛtā mayaiveyaṃ śāpabhraṣṭā varāpsarāḥ / yuṣmatsvasā yuvāṃ caiva śāpenaiva cyutau bhuvi //	he belongs to the Brāhman race, and it is by him that I am pregnant.” When they heard this speech of their sister’s, Vatsa and Gulma said: “What confidence can we repose in all this?” Then she silently called to mind that Nāga prince, and immediately he was thought upon he came and said to Vatsa and Gulma: “In truth I have made your sister my wife.
putro janiṣyate cātra yuṣmatsvasurasaṃśayam / tato 'syāḥ śāpanirmuktiryuvayośca bhaviṣyati // ityuktvāntarhitaḥ so 'bhūttataḥ stokaiśca vāsaraiḥ / śrutārthāyāḥ suto jātastaṃ hi jānīhi māṃ sakhe //	but a son shall without fail be born to your sister here, and then you and she together shall be freed from your curse.” Having said this, he disappeared, and in a few days from that time a son was born to Śrutārthā.
gaṇāvatāro jāto 'yaṃ guṇāḍhyo nāma brāhmaṇaḥ / iti tatkālam udabhūd antarikṣāt sarasvatī // kṣīṇaśāpāstataste ca jananīmātulā mama / kālena pañcatāṃ prāptā gataścāhamadhīratām //	Know me, my friend, as that son.[4] At that very time a divine voice was heard from heaven: “This child that is born is an incarnation of virtue,[5] and he shall be called Guṇāḍhya,[6] and is of the Brāhman caste.” Thereupon my mother and uncles, as their curse had spent its force, died, and I for my part became inconsolable.
atha śokaṃ samutsṛjya bālo 'pi gatavānaham / svāvaṣṭambhena vidyānāṃ prāptaye dakṣiṇāpatham //	Then I flung aside my grief, and though a child I went in the strength of my self-reliance to the Deccan to acquire knowledge.
kālena tatra saṃprāpya sarvā vidyāḥ prasiddhimān / svadeśam āgato 'bhūvaṃ darśayiṣyan nijān guṇān //	Then, having in course of time learned all the sciences, and become famous, I returned to my native land to exhibit my accomplishments;
praviśaṃśca cirāttatra nagare supratiṣṭhite / apaśyaṃ śiṣyasahitaḥ śobhāṃ kāmapyahaṃ tadā //	and when I entered after a long absence into the city of Supratiṣṭhita, surrounded by my disciples, I saw a wonderfully splendid scene.
kvacitsāmāni chandogā gāyanti ca yathāvidhi / kvacidvivādo viprāṇāmabhūdvedavinirṇaye //	In one place chanters were intoning according to prescribed custom the hymns of the Sāma Veda; in another place Brāhmans were disputing about the interpretation of the sacred books;
yo 'tra dyūtakalāṃ vetti tasya hastagato nidhiḥ / ityādikaitavair dyūtam astuvan kitavāḥ kvacit // anyonyaṃ nijavāṇijyakalākauśalavādinām / kvacicca vaṇijāṃ madhye vaṇigeko 'bravīdidam // arthaiḥ saṃyamavān arthān prāpnoti kiyad adbhutam / mayā punar vinaivārthaṃ lakṣmīr āsāditā purā //	in another place gamblers were praising gambling in these deceitful words “Whoever knows the art of gambling has a treasure in his grasp”; and in another place, in the midst of a knot of merchants, who were talking to one another about their skill in the art of making money, a certain merchant spoke as follows: — “It is not very wonderful that a thrifty man should acquire wealth by wealth; but I long ago achieved prosperity without any wealth to start with.
garbhasthasya ca me pūrvaṃ pitā pañcatvamāgataḥ / manmātuśca tadā pāpairgotrajaiḥ sakalaṃ hṛtam //	My father died before I was born, and then my mother was deprived by wicked relations of all she possessed.

vaṇikputro 'si tatputra vāṇijyaṃ kuru sāṃpratam / viśākhilākhyo deśe 'smin vaṇik cāsti mahādhanaḥ // daridrāṇāṃ kulīnānāṃ bhāṇḍamūlyaṃ dadāti saḥ / gaccha yācasva taṃ mūlyamiti mātābravīcca mām //	And as she was so poor, she persuaded a teacher by way of charity to give me some instruction in writing and ciphering.[8] Then she said to me: ‘You are the son of a merchant, so you must now engage in trade, and there is a very rich merchant in this country called Viśākhila;
mūṣako dṛśyate yo 'yaṃ gataprāṇo 'tra bhūtale / etenāpi hi paṇyena kuśalo dhanamarjayet //	he is in the habit of lending capital to poor men of good family;

kṛtvā tāṃś caṇakān bhṛṣṭān gṛhītvā jalakumbhikām / atiṣṭhaṃ catvare gatvā chāyāyā nagarādvahiḥ // tatra śrāntāgatāyāmbhaḥ śītalaṃ caṇakāṃśca tān / kāṣṭhabhārikasaṃghāya sapraśrayamadāmaham //	Well, I sold that mouse to a certain merchant as cat’s-meat for two handfuls of gram, then I ground up that gram and, taking a pitcher of water, I went and stood on the cross-road in a shady place, outside the city; there I offered with the utmost civility the water and gram to a band of wood-cutters[10];
ekaikaḥ kāṣṭhikaḥ prītyā kāṣṭhe dve dve dadau mama / cikrītavānahaṃ tāni nītvā kāṣṭhāni cāpaṇe // tataḥ stokena mūlyena krītvā tāṃścaṇakāṃstataḥ / tathaiva kāṣṭhikebhyo 'hamanyedyuḥ kāṣṭhamāharam //	every wood-cutter gave me as a token of gratitude two pieces of wood; and I took those pieces of wood and sold them in the market; then for a small part of the price which I got for them I bought a second supply of gram, and in the same way on a second day I obtained wood from the wood-cutters.
evaṃ pratidinaṃ kṛtvā prāpya mūlyaṃ kramānyayā / kāṣṭhikebhyo 'khilaṃ dāru krītaṃ tebhyo dinatrayam //	Doing this every day I gradually acquired capital, and I bought from those wood-cutters all their wood for three days.
akasmādatha saṃjāte kāṣṭhacchede 'tivṛṣṭibhiḥ / mayā taddāru vikrītaṃ paṇānāṃ bahubhiḥ śataiḥ //	Then suddenly there befell a dearth of wood on account of heavy rains, and I sold that wood for many hundred paṇas;
tenaiva vipaṇiṃ kṛtvā dhanena nijakauśalāt / kurvanvaṇijyāṃ kramaśaḥ saṃpanno 'smi mahādhanaḥ //	with that wealth I set up a shop and, engaging in traffic, I have become a very wealthy man by my own ability.
sauvarṇo mūṣakaḥ kṛtvā mayā tasmai samarpitaḥ / viśākhilāya so 'pi svāṃ kanyāṃ mahyamadāttataḥ //	Then I made a mouse of gold and gave it to that Viśākhila; then he gave me his daughter;
ata eva ca loke 'smin prasiddho mūṣakākhyayā / evaṃ lakṣmīr iyaṃ prāptā nirdhanena satā mayā //	and in consequence of my history I am known in the world by the name of Mouse. So without a coin in the world I acquired this prosperity.” All the other merchants then, when they heard this story, were astonished.

tatra kiṃ karavāṇīti dvijenokto viṭo 'bravīt / svarṇaṃ dattvā prayuñjīthā rañjayansāma kiṃcana // śrutvety agacchac chandogo drutaṃ caturikāgṛham / upāviśat praviśyātra kṛtapratyudgatistayā //	go to her house.” The Brāhman said: “What am I to do there?” The roué replied: “Give her gold, and in order to please her make use of some sāma”[14] When he heard this, the chanter went quickly to the house of Caturikā; when he entered, the lady advanced to meet him and he took a seat.
māmadya lokayātrāṃ tvaṃ śikṣayaitena sāṃpratam / iti jalpansa tattasyai svarṇamarpitavāndvijaḥ // prahasatyatha tatrasthe jane kiṃcidvicintya saḥ / gokarṇasadṛśau kṛtvā karāvābaddhasāraṇau // tārasvaraṃ tathā sāma gāyati sma jaḍāśayaḥ / yathā tatra milanti sma viṭā hāsyadidṛkṣavaḥ //	Then that Brāhman gave her the gold and faltered out the request: “Teach me now for this fee the way of the world.” Thereupon the people who were there began to titter, and he, after reflecting a little, putting his hands together in the shape of a cow’s ear, so that they formed a kind of pipe, began, like a stupid idiot, to chant with a shrill sound the Sāma Veda, so that all the roués in the house came together to see the fun;
te cāvocañ śṛgālo 'yaṃ praviṣṭo 'tra kuto 'nyathā / tac chīghram ardhacandro 'sya gale 'smin dīyatām iti // ardhacandraṃ śaraṃ matvā śiraśchedabhayāddrutam / śikṣitā lokayātreti garjansa niragāttataḥ // tatsakāśaṃ tato 'gacchadyenāsu preṣito 'bhavat / vṛttāntaṃ cāvadattasmai so 'pi cainamabhāṣata //	and they said: “Whence has this jackal blundered in here? Come, let us quickly give him the half-moon[15] on his throat.” Thereupon the Brāhman, supposing that the half-moon meant an arrow with a head of that shape, and afraid of having his head cut off, rushed out of the house, bellowing out: “I have learnt the way of the world.” Then he went to the man who had sent him and told him the whole story.
sāma sāntvaṃ mayoktaṃ te vedasyāvasaro 'tra kaḥ / kiṃ vā dhārādhirūḍhaṃ hi jāḍyaṃ vedajaḍe jane // evaṃ vihasya gatvā ca tenoktā sā vilāsinī / dvipadasya paśorasya tatsuvarṇatṛṇaṃ tyaja // hasantyā ca tayā tyaktaṃ suvarṇaṃ prāpya sa dvijaḥ / punarjātamivātmānaṃ manvāno gṛhamāgataḥ //	What is the propriety of introducing the Veda in a matter of this kind? The fact is, I suppose, that stupidity is engrained in a man who muddles his head with the Vedas.” So he spoke, bursting with laughter all the while, and went off to the lady’s house and said to her: “Give back to that two-legged cow his gold-fodder.” So she, laughing, gave back the money, and when the Brāhman got it he went back to his house as happy as if he had been born again.
evaṃprāyāṇy ahaṃ paśyan kautukāni pade pade / prāptavān rājabhavanaṃ mahendrasadanopamam //	Witnessing strange scenes of this kind at every step, I reached the palace of the king, which was like the Court of Indra.

athāhaṃ rājakāryāṇi cintayannavasaṃ sukham / śiṣyānadhyāpayaṃstatra kṛtadāraparigrahaḥ //	Then I married a wife, and lived there comfortably, looking after the king’s affairs and instructing my pupils.

sa divyamidamudyānaṃ sadevabhavanaṃ vyadhāt / tato 'tra brāhmaṇāḥ sarve milanti sma sakautukāḥ // nirbandhāttaiḥ sa pṛṣṭaḥ svaṃ vṛttāntam avadad dvijaḥ / astīha bharukacchākhyo viṣayo narmadātaṭe //	he made this heavenly garden with a temple; then all the Brāhmans assembled here out of curiosity, and that Brāhman being persistently asked by them told his history: “‘There is in this land a province called Bakakaccha, on the banks of the Narmadā;
tasminn ahaṃ samutpanno viprastasya ca me purā / na bhikṣāmapyadātkaściddaridrasyālasasya ca //	in that district I was born as a Brāhman, and in former times no one gave me alms, as I was lazy as well as poor;
atha khedādgṛhaṃ tyaktvā virakto jīvitaṃ prati / bhrāntvā tīrthānyahaṃ draṣṭumagacchaṃ vindhyavāsinīm // dṛṣṭvā tataśca tāṃ devīmiti saṃcintitaṃ mayā / lokaḥ paśūpahāreṇa prīṇāti varadāmimām // ahaṃ tvātmānameveha hanmi mūrkhamimaṃ paśum / niścityeti śiraśchettuṃ mayā śastramagṛhyata //	then in a fit of annoyance I quitted my house, being disgusted with life, and wandering round the holy places I came to visit the shrine of Durgā, the dweller in the Vindhya hills, and having beheld that goddess, I reflected: “People propitiate with animal offerings this giver of boons, but I will slay myself here, stupid beast that I am.” Having formed this resolve, I took in hand a sword to cut off my head.
tatkṣaṇaṃ sā prasannā māṃ devī svayamabhāṣata / putra siddho 'si mātmānaṃ vadhīstiṣṭha mamāntike //	Immediately that goddess, being propitious, herself said to me: “Son, thou art perfected, do not slay thyself, remain near me.” Thus I obtained a boon from the goddess and attained divine nature.
iti devīvaraṃ labdhvā saṃprāptā divyatā mayā / tataḥ prabhṛti naṣṭā me bubhukṣā ca tṛṣā saha //	From that day forth my hunger and thirst disappeared;
kadācidatha devī māṃ tatrasthaṃ svayamādiśat / gatvā putra pratiṣṭhāne racayodyānamuttamam // ityuktvā saiva me bījaṃ divyaṃ prādāttato mayā / ihāgatya kṛtaṃ kāntamudyānaṃ tatprabhāvataḥ //	then once on a time, as I was remaining there, that goddess herself said to me: “Go, my son, and plant in Pratiṣṭhāna a glorious garden.” Thus speaking, she gave me, with her own hands, heavenly seed; thereupon I came here and made this beautiful garden by means of her power;
pālyametacca yuṣmākamityuktvā sa tirodadhe / iti nirmitam udyānam idaṃ devyā purā prabho // udānapālād ityevaṃ taddeśe devyanugraham / ākarṇya vismayāviṣṭo gṛhāya gatavānaham //	and this garden you must keep in good order.’ Having said this, he disappeared. In this way this garden was made by the goddess long ago, my lord.” When I had heard from the gardener this signal manifestation of the favour of the goddess, I went home penetrated with wonder.

There was a king of great power named Dvīpikarṇi.
tasya śaktimatī nāma bhāryā prāṇādhikābhavat / ratāntasuptām udyāne sarpastāṃ jātu daṣṭavān //	He had a wife named Śaktimatī, whom he valued more then life, and once upon a time a snake bit her as she was sleeping in the garden.
tataḥ kadācid rājyārhaputrāsadbhāvaduḥkhitam / ityādideśa taṃ svapne bhagavāninduśekharaḥ //	Thereupon she died, and that king, thinking only of her, though he had no son, took a vow of perpetual chastity.

dadarśa tatra madhyāhne siṃhārūḍhaṃ sa bhūpatiḥ / bālakaṃ padmasarasastīre tapanatejasam //	there in the middle of the day that king beheld on the bank of a lotus-lake a boy, splendid as the sun, riding on a lion[18];

The creature thereupon abandoned the form of a lion, and suddenly assumed the shape of a man. The king exclaimed: “Alas! what means this? Tell me.” And then the man answered him: “O king, I am a Yakṣa of the name of Sāta, an attendant upon the God of Wealth;
sāpi māṃ vīkṣya saṃjātamanmathābhūdahaṃ tathā / gāndharveṇa vivāhena tato bhāryā kṛtā mayā //	she too, when she beheld me, felt love arise in her breast, like myself: then I made her my wife by the gāndharva form of marriage[19];

sātena yasmād ūḍho 'bhūt tasmāt taṃ sātavāhanam / nāmnā cakāra kālena rājye cainaṃ nyaveśayet //	and because he had ridden upon Sāta he gave the boy the name of Sātavāhana, and in course of time he established him in his kingdom.
tatas tasmin gate 'raṇyaṃ dīpakarṇau kṣitīśvare / saṃvṛttaḥ sārvabhaumo 'sau bhūpatiḥ sātavāhanaḥ //	Then, when that King Dvīpikarṇi went to the forest, this Sātavāhana became sovereign of the whole earth.
evamuktvā kathāṃ madhye kāṇabhūtyanuyogataḥ / guṇāḍhyaḥ prakṛtaṃ dhīmānanusmṛtyābravītpunaḥ //	[M] (main story line continued) Having said this in the middle of his tale in answer to Kāṇabhūti’s question, the wise Guṇāḍhya again called to mind and went on with the main thread of his narrative.
tataḥ kadācidadhyāsta vasantasamayotsave / devīkṛtaṃ tadudyānaṃ sa rājā sātavāhanaḥ //	Then once upon a time, in the spring festival, that King Sātavāhana went to visit the garden made by the goddess, of which I spake before.
viharansuciraṃ tatra mahendra iva nandane / vāpījale 'vatīrṇo 'bhūtkrīḍituṃ kāminīsakhaḥ //	He roamed there for a long time like Indra in the garden of Nandana, and descended into the water of the lake to amuse himself in company with his wives.
asiñcattatra dayitāḥ sahelaṃ karavāribhiḥ / asicyata sa tābhiśca vaśābhiriva vāraṇaḥ //	There he sprinkled his beloved ones sportively with water flung by his hands, and was sprinkled by them in return like an elephant by its females.
mukhairdhautāñjanātāmranetrairjahnujalāplutaiḥ / aṅgaiḥ saktāmbaravyaktavibhāgaiśca tamaṅganāḥ // vidalatpatratilakāḥ sa cakre vanamadhyagāḥ / cyutābharaṇapuṣpāstā latā vāyuriva priyāḥ //	His wives, with faces, the eyes of which were slightly reddened by the collyrium[21] washed into them, and which were streaming with water, and with bodies, the proportions of which were revealed by their clinging garments,[22] pelted him vigorously; and as the wind strips the creepers in the forest of leaves and flowers, so he made his fair ones, who fled into the adjoining shrubbery, lose the marks on their foreheads[23] and their ornaments.
athaikā tasya mahiṣī rājñaḥ stanabharālasā / śirīṣasukumārāṅgī krīḍantī klamamabhyagāt //	Then one of his queens, tardy with the weight of her breasts, with body tender as a śirīṣa flower, became exhausted with the amusement;
sā jalairabhiṣiñcantaṃ rājānamasahā satī / abravīnmodakairdeva paritāḍaya māmiti // tac chrutvā modakān rājā drutam ānāyayad bahūn / tato vihasya sā rājñī punar evam abhāṣata // rājannavasaraḥ ko 'tra modakānāṃ jalāntare / udakaiḥ siñca mā tvaṃ māmityuktaṃ hi mayā tava //	she not being able to endure more, said to the king, who was sprinkling her with water: “Do not pelt me with water-drops.” On hearing that, the king quickly had some sweetmeats[24] brought. Then the queen burst out laughing and said again: “King, what do we want with sweetmeats in the water? For I said to you, do not sprinkle me with water-drops.
saṃdhimātraṃ na jānāsi māśabdodakaśabdayoḥ / na ca prakaraṇaṃ vetsi mūrkhastvaṃ kathamīdṛśaḥ // ityuktaḥ sa tayā rājā śabdaśāstravidā nṛpaḥ / parivāre hasatyantarlajjākrānto jhagityabhūt //	Do you not even understand the coalescence of the words mā and udaka, and do you not know that chapter of the grammar? How can you be such a blockhead?” When the queen, who knew grammatical treatises, said this to him, and the attendants laughed, the king was at once overpowered with secret shame;
parityaktajalakrīḍo vītadarpaśca tatkṣaṇam / jātāvamāno nirlakṣaḥ prāviśannijamandiram //	he left off romping in the water and immediately entered his own palace unperceived, crestfallen and full of self-contempt.
tataścintāparo muhyannāharādiparāṅmukhaḥ / citrastha iva pṛṣṭo 'pi naiva kiṃcidabhāṣata //	Then he remained lost in thought, bewildered, averse to food and other enjoyments, and, like a picture, even when asked a question, he answered nothing.
pāṇḍityaṃ śaraṇaṃ vā me mṛtyurveti vicintayan / śayanīyaparityaktagāraḥ saṃtāpavānabhūt //	Thinking that his only resource was to acquire learning or die, he flung himself down on a couch, and remained in an agony of grief.
akasmādatha rājñastāṃ dṛṣṭvāvasthāṃ tathāvidhām / kimetaditi saṃbhrāntaḥ sarvaḥ parijano 'bhavat //	Then all the king’s attendants, seeing that he had suddenly fallen into such a state, were utterly beside themselves to think what it could mean.
tato 'haṃ śarvavarmā ca jñātavantau krameṇa tām / atrāntare sa ca prāyaḥ paryahīyata vāsaraḥ //	Then I and Śarvavarman came at last to hear of the king’s condition, and by that time the day was almost at an end.
asmin kāle na ca svastho rājety ālocya tatkṣaṇam / āvābhyāṃ rājahaṃsākhya āhūto rājaceṭakaḥ //	So perceiving that the king was still in an unsatisfactory condition, we immediately summoned a servant of the king named Rājahansa.
śarīravārtāṃ bhūpasya sa ca pṛṣṭo 'bravīd idam / nedṛśo durmanāḥ pūrvaṃ dṛṣṭo devaḥ kadācana // viṣṇuśaktiduhitrā ca mithyāpaṇḍitayā tayā / vilakṣīkṛta ityāhurdevyo 'nyāḥ kopanirbharam // etattasya mukhācchrutvā rājaceṭasya durmanāḥ / śarvavarmadvitīyo 'haṃ saṃśayādityacintayam // vyādhiryadi bhavedrājñaḥ praviśeyuścikitsakāḥ / ādhirvā yadi tatrāsya kāraṇaṃ nopalabhyate //	And he, when asked by us about the state of the king’s health, said this: “I never before in my life saw the king in such a state of depression: and the other queens told me with much indignation that he had been humiliated to-day by that superficial blue-stocking, the daughter of Viṣṇuśakti.” When Śarvavarman and I had heard this from the mouth of the king’s servant, we fell into a state of despondency, and thus reflected in our dilemma: “If the king were afflicted with bodily disease we might introduce the physicians, but if his disease is mental it is impossible to find the cause of it.
nāstyeva hi vipakṣo 'sya rājye nihatakaṇṭake / anuraktāḥ prajāścaitā na hāniḥ paridṛśyate //	For there is no enemy in his country the thorns of which are destroyed, and these subjects are attached to him; no dearth of any kind is to be seen;
tatkasmād eṣa khedaḥ syād īdṛśaḥ sahasa prabhoḥ / evaṃ vicintite dhīmāñ śarvavarmedam abravīt // ahaṃ jānāmi rājño 'sya manyurmaurkhyānutāpataḥ / mūrkho 'ham iti pāṇḍityaṃ sadaivāyaṃ hi vāñchati // upalabdho mayā caiṣa pūrvam eva tadāśayaḥ / rājñyāvamānitaś cādya tannimittam iti śrutam // evamanyonyamālocya tāṃ rātrimativāhya ca / prātar āvāma gacchāva vāsaveśma mahīpateḥ //	so how can this sudden melancholy of the king’s have arisen?” After we had debated to this effect, the wise Śarvavarman said as follows:— “I know the cause: this king is distressed by sorrow for his own ignorance, for he is always expressing a desire for culture, saying, ‘I am a blockhead.’ I long ago detected this desire of his, and we have heard that the occasion of the present fit is his having been humiliated by the queen.” Thus we debated with one another, and after we had passed that night, in the morning we went to the private apartments of the sovereign.
tatra sarvasya ruddhe 'pi praveśe kathamapyaham / prāviśaṃ mama paścācca śarvavarmā laghukramam //	There, though strict orders had been given that no one was to enter, I managed to get in with difficulty, and after me Śarvavarman slipped in quickly.
upaviśyātha nikaṭe vijñaptaḥ sa mayā nṛpaḥ / akāraṇaṃ kathaṃ deva vartase vimanā iti // tacchrutvāpi tathaivāsītsa tūṣṇīṃ sātavāhanaḥ / śarvavarmā tataścedamadbhutaṃ vākyamabravīt // śrutaṃ mama syāt kāpīti prāguktaṃ deva me tvayā / tenāhaṃ kṛtavānadyā svapnamāṇavakaṃ niśi // svapne tato mayā dṛṣṭaṃ nabhasaścyutamambujam / tacca divyena kenāpi kumāreṇa vikāsitam //	I then sat down near the king and asked him this question: “Why, O king, art thou without cause thus despondent?” Though he heard this, Sātavāhana nevertheless remained silent, and then Śarvavarman uttered this extraordinary speech: “King, thou didst long ago say to me, ‘Make me a learned man.’ Thinking upon that, I employed last night a charm to produce a dream.[25] Then I saw in my dream a lotus fallen from heaven, and it was opened by some heavenly youth, and out of it came a divine woman in white garments, and immediately, O king, she entered thy mouth.
iyaddṛṣṭvā prabuddho 'smi manye sā ca sarasvatī / devasya vadane sākṣāt saṃpraviṣṭā na saṃśayaḥ // evaṃ niveditasvapne śarvavarmaṇi tatkṣaṇam / māmastamaunaḥ sākūtamavadatsātavāhanaḥ // śikṣamāṇaḥ prayatnenā kālena kiyatā pumān / adhigacchati pāṇḍityametanme kathyatāṃ tvayā //	When I had seen so much I woke up, and I think without doubt that the woman who visibly entered thy mouth was Sarasvatī.” As soon as Śarvavarman had in these terms described his dream, the king broke his silence and said to me with the utmost earnestness: “In how short a time can a man, who is diligently taught, acquire learning? Tell me this.
mama tena vinā hyeṣā lakṣmīrna pratibhāsate / vibhavaiḥ kiṃ nu mūrkhasya kāṣṭhasyābharaṇairiva // tato 'hamavadaṃ rājanvarṣairdvādaśabhiḥ sadā / jñāyate sarvavidyānāṃ mukhaṃ vyākaraṇaṃ naraiḥ //	For without learning all this regal splendour has no charms for me. What is the use of rank and power to a blockhead? They are like ornaments on a log of wood.” Then I said: “King, it is invariably the case that it takes men twelve years to learn grammar, the gate to all knowledge.
ahaṃ tu śikṣayāmi tvāṃ varṣaṣaṭkena tadvibho / śrutvaitatsahasā serṣyaṃ śarvavarmā kilāvadat // sukhocito janaḥ kleśaṃ kathaṃ kuryadiyacciram / tadahaṃ māsaṣaṭkena deva tvāṃ śikṣayāmi tat // śrutvaivaitad asaṃbhāvyaṃ tam avocam ahaṃ ruṣā / ṣaḍbhir māsais tvayā devaḥ śikṣitaś cet tato mayā // saṃskṛtaṃ prākṛtaṃ tadvaddeśabhāṣā ca sarvadā / bhāṣātrayamidaṃ tyaktaṃ yanmanuṣyeṣu saṃbhavet // śarvavarmā tato 'vādīnna cedevaṃ karomyaham / dvādaśābdānvahāmyeṣa śirasā tava pāduke //	But I, my sovereign, will teach it you in six years.” When he heard that, Śarvavarman suddenly exclaimed, in a fit of jealousy: “How can a man accustomed to enjoyment endure hardship for so long? So I will teach you grammar, my prince, in six months.” When I heard this promise, which it seemed impossible to make good, I said to him in a rage: “If you teach the king in six months, I renounce at once and for ever Sanskrit, Prakrit and the vernacular dialect, these three languages which pass current among men.”[26] Then Śarvavarman said: “And if I do not do this, I, Śarvavarman, will carry your shoes on my head for twelve years.” Having said this, he went out;
ityuktvā nirgate tasminnahamapyagamaṃ gṛham / rājāpyubhayataḥ siddhiṃ matvāśvasto babhūva saḥ //	I too went home; and the king for his part was comforted, expecting that he would attain his object by means of one of us two.
vihastaḥ śarvavarmā ca pratijñāṃ tāṃ sadustarām / paśyansānuśayaḥ sarvaṃ svabhāryāyai śaśaṃsa tat // sāpi taṃ duḥkhitāvocatsaṃkaṭe 'smiṃstava prabho / vinā svāmikumāreṇa gatiranyā na dṛśyate //	Now Śarvavarman being in a dilemma, seeing that his promise was one very difficult to perform, and regretting what he had done, told the whole story to his wife, and she, grieved to hear it, said to him: “My lord, in this difficulty there is no way of escape for you except the favour of the Lord Kārttikeya.”[27] “It is so,” said Śarvavarman, and determined to implore it.
tatheti niścayaṃ kṛtvā paścime prahare niśi / śarvavarmā nirāhārastatraiva prasthito 'bhavat //	Accordingly in the last watch of the night Śarvavarman set out fasting for the shrine of the god.
tacca cāramukhādbuddhvā mayā prātarniveditam / rājñe so 'pi tadākarṇya kiṃ bhavedityacintayat //	Now I came to hear of it by means of my secret emissaries, and in the morning I told the king of it; and he, when he heard it, wondered what would happen.
tatastaṃ siṃhaguptākhyo rājaputro hito 'bravīt / tvayi khinne tadā deva nirvedo me mahānabhūt //	Then a trusty Rājpūt called Siṃhagupta said to him: “When I heard, O king, that thou wast afflicted I was seized with great despondency.
maivaṃ kṛthā nṛpasyecchā setsyatyevetyavārayat / vāgantarikṣādatha māṃ tanmanye siddhirasti te //	Then I went out of this city, and was preparing to cut off my own head before the goddess Durgā in order to ensure thy happiness.
ityuktvā nṛpamāmantrya satvaraṃ śarvavarmaṇaḥ / paścāccāradvayaṃ so 'tha siṃhagupto vyasarjayat // so 'pi vātaikabhakṣaḥ san kṛtamaunaḥ suniścayaḥ / prāpa svāmikumārasya śarvavarmāntikaṃ kramāt //	the king’s wish shall be fulfilled.’ Therefore, I believe, thou art sure of success.” When he had said this, that Siṃhagupta took leave of the king and rapidly dispatched two emissaries after Śarvavarman, who, feeding only on air, observing a vow of silence, steadfast in resolution, reached at last the shrine of the Lord Kārttikeya.
śarīranirapekṣeṇa tapasā tatra toṣitaḥ / prasādamakarottasya kārtikeyo yathepsitam //	There, pleased with his penance that spared not the body, Kārttikeya favoured him according to his desire;
āgatyāgre tato rājñe cārābhyāṃ sa niveditaḥ / siṃhaguptavisṛṣṭābhyāmudayaḥ śarvavarmaṇaḥ // tacchrutvā mama rājñaśca viṣādapramadau dvayoḥ / abhūtāṃ mekhamālokya haṃsacātakayoriva // āgatya śarvavarmātha kumāravarasiddhimān / cintitopasthitā rājñe sarvā vidyāḥ pradattavān //	then the two spies sent by Siṃhagupta came into the king’s presence and reported the minister’s success. On hearing that news the king was delighted and I was despondent, as the chātaka joys, and the swan grieves, on seeing the cloud.[28] Then Śarvavarman arrived, successful by the favour of Kārttikeya, and communicated to the king all the sciences, which presented themselves to him on his thinking of them.
prādurāsaṃśca tāstasya sātavāhanabhūpateḥ / tatkṣaṇaṃ kiṃ na kuryāddhi prasādaḥ pārameśvaraḥ // atha tam akhilavidyālābham ākarṇya rājñaḥ pramuditavati rāṣṭre tatra ko 'pyutsavo 'bhūt / api pavanavidhūtāstatkṣaṇollāsyamānāḥ prativasati patākā baddhanṛttā ivāsan //	And immediately they were revealed to the King Sātavāhana. For what cannot the grace of the Supreme Lord accomplish? Then the kingdom rejoiced on hearing that the king had thus obtained all knowledge, and there was high festival kept throughout it; and that moment banners were flaunted from every house and, being fanned by the wind, seemed to dance.
rājārharatnanicayairatha śarvavarmā tenārcito gururiti praṇatena rājñā / svāmīkṛtaśca viṣaye marukacchanāmni kūlopakaṇṭhaviniveśini narmadāyāḥ //	Then Śarvavarman was honoured with abundance of jewels fit for a king by the sovereign, who bowed humbly before him, calling him his spiritual preceptor; and he was made governor of the territory called Bakakaccha, which lies along the bank of the Narmadā.
yo 'gre cāramukhena ṣaṇmukhavaraprāptiṃ samākarṇayat saṃtuṣyātmasamaṃ śriyā narapatistaṃ siṃhaguptaṃ vyadhāt / rājñīṃ tām api viṣṇuśaktitanayāṃ vidyāgame kāraṇaṃ devīnāmupari prasahya kṛtavān prītyābhiṣicya svayam // iti mahākaviśrīsomadevabhaṭṭaviracite kathāsaritsāgare kathāpīṭhalambake ṣaṣṭhas taraṅgaḥ / saptamas taraṅgaḥ / tato gṛhītamauno 'haṃ rājāntikamupāgamam / tara ca ślokamapaṭhaddvijaḥ kaścitsvayaṃ kṛtam //	The king being highly pleased with that Rājpūt Siṃhagupta, who first heard by the mouth of his spies that the boon had been obtained from the six-faced god,[29] made him equal to himself in splendour and power. And that queen too, the daughter of Viṣṇuśakti, who was the cause of his acquiring learning he exalted at one bound above all the queens, through affection anointing[30] her with his own hand. THEN, having taken a vow of silence, I came into the presence of the sovereign, and there a certain Brāhman recited a śloka he had composed, and the king himself addressed him correctly in the Sanskrit language;
taṃ cācaṣṭa svayaṃ rājā samyaksaṃskṛtayā girā / tatrālokya ca tatrastho janaḥ pramudito 'bhavat //	and the people who were present in Court were delighted when they witnessed that.
tataḥ sa śarvavarmāṇaṃ rājā savinayo 'bravīt / svayaṃ kathaya devena kahaṃ te 'nugrahaḥ kṛtaḥ // tacchrutvānugrahaṃ rājñaḥ śarvavarmābhyabhāṣata / ito rājannirāhāro maunastho 'haṃ tadā gataḥ //	Then the king said deferentially to Śarvavarman: “Tell me thyself after what fashion the god showed thee favour.” Hearing that, Śarvavarman proceeded to relate to the king the whole story of Kārttikeya’s favourable acceptance of him.
tato 'dhvani manāk cheṣe jāte tīvratapaḥkṛśaḥ / klāntaḥ patitavān asmi niḥsaṃjño dharaṇītale //	I went, O king, on that occasion fasting and silent from this place, so when the journey came to an end,[1] being very despondent, and emaciated with my severe austerities, worn out, I fell senseless on the ground.
uttiṣṭha putra sarvaṃ te saṃpatsyata iti sphuṭam / śaktihastaḥ pumānetya jāne māmabravīttadā // tenāhamamṛtāsārasaṃsikta iva tatkṣaṇam / prabuddhaḥ kṣutpipāsādihīnaḥ svastha ivābhavam //	Then, I remember, a man with a spear in his hand came and said to me in distinct accents: “Rise up, my son; everything shall turn out favourably for thee.” By that speech I was, as it were, immediately bedewed with a shower of nectar, and I woke up, and seemed free from hunger and thirst and in good case.
atha devasya nikaṭaṃ prāpya bhaktibharākulaḥ / snātvā garbhagṛhaṃ tasya praviṣṭo 'bhūvamunmanāḥ //	Then I approached the neighbourhood of the god’s temple, overpowered with the weight of my devotion, and after bathing I entered the inner shrine of the god in a state of agitated suspense.
tato 'ntaḥ prabhuṇā tena skandena mama darśanam / dattaṃ tataḥ praviṣṭā me mukhe mūrtā sarasvatī //	Then that Lord Skanda[2] gave me a sight of himself within, and thereupon Sarasvatī in visible shape entered my mouth.
tacchrutvaiva manuṣyatvasulabhācāpalādbata / uttaraṃ sūtramabhyūhya svayameva mayoditam //	So that holy god, manifested before me, recited the sūtra beginning, “the traditional doctrine of letters.” On hearing that I, with the levity which is so natural to mankind, guessed the next sūtra and uttered it myself.
athābravītsa devo māṃ nāvadiṣyaḥ svayaṃ yadi / abhaviṣyadidaṃ śāstraṃ pāṇinīyopamardakam //	Then that god said to me: “If thou hadst not uttered it thyself, this grammatical treatise would have supplanted that of Pāṇini.
adhunā svalpatantratvātkātantrākhyaṃ bhaviṣyati / madvāhanakalāpasya nāmnā kālāpakaṃ tathā // ityuktvā śabdaśāstraṃ tatprakāśyābhinavaṃ laghu / sākṣādeva sa māṃ devaḥ punarevamabhāṣata // yuṣmadīyaḥ sa rājāpi pūrvajanmanyabhūdṛṣiḥ / bharadvājamuneḥ śiṣyaḥ kṛṣṇasaṃjño mahātapāḥ // tulyābhilāṣām ālokya sa caikāṃ munikanyakām / yayāv akasmāt puṣpeṣuśaraghātarasajñatām //	As it is, on account of its conciseness, it shall be called Kātantra, and Kālāpaka, from the tail (kalāpa) of the peacock on which I ride.” Having said this, that god himself in visible form revealed to me that new and short grammar,[3] and then added this besides: “That king of thine in a former birth was himself a holy sage, a pupil of the hermit Bharadvāja, named Kṛṣṇa, great in austerity, and he, having beheld a hermit’s daughter who loved him in return, suddenly felt the smart of the wound which the shaft of the flowery-arrowed god inflicts.
ataḥ sa śapto munibhiravatīrṇa ihādhunā / sā cāvatīrṇā devītve tasyaiva munikanyakā //	So, having been cursed by the hermits, he has now become incarnate here, and that hermit’s daughter has become incarnate as his queen.
itthamṛṣyavatāro 'yaṃ nṛpatiḥ sātavāhanaḥ / dṛṣṭe tvayyakhilā vidyā prāpsyatyeva tvadicchayā //	So this King Sātavāhana, being an incarnation of a holy sage,[4] when he beholds thee will attain a knowledge of all the sciences according to thy wish.
akleśalabhyā hi bhavantyuttamārthā mahātmanām / janmāntarārjitāḥ sphārasaṃskārākṣiptasiddhayaḥ // ityuktvāntarhite deve niragacchamahaṃ bahiḥ / taṇḍulā me pradattāśca tatra devopajīvibhiḥ //	For the highest matters are easily acquired by great-souled ones, having been learnt in a former birth, the real truth of them being recalled by their powerful memories.”[5] When the god had said this he disappeared, and I went out, and there grains of rice were presented me by the god’s servants.
tato 'ham āgato rājaṃs taṇḍulās te ca me pathi / citraṃ tāvanta evāsan bhujyamānā dine dine //	Then I proceeded to return, O king, and wonderful to say, though I consumed those grains on my journey day after day, they remained as numerous as ever.
evamuktvā svavṛttāntaṃ virate śarvavarmaṇi / udatiṣṭhannṛpaḥ snātuṃ prahṛṣṭaḥ sātavāhanaḥ //	When he had related his adventure, Śarvavarman ceased speaking, and King Sātavāhana in cheerful mood rose up and went to bathe.
tato 'haṃ kṛtamaunatvādvyavahārabahiṣkṛtaḥ / anicchantaṃ tamāmantrya praṇāmenaiva bhūpatim // nirgatya nagarāttasmācchiṣyadvayasamanvitaḥ / tapase niścito draṣṭumāgato vindhyavāsinīm // svapnādeśena devyā ca tayaiva preṣitastataḥ / vindhyāṭavīṃ praviṣṭo 'haṃ tvāṃ draṣṭuṃ bhīṣaṇāmimām //	Then I, being excluded from business by my vow of silence, took leave, with a low bow only, of that king, who was very averse to part with me, and went out of that town, accompanied by only two disciples, and, with my mind bent on the performance of austerities, came to visit the shrine of the dweller in the Vindhya hills, and having been directed by the goddess in a dream to visit thee, I entered for that purpose this terrible Vindhya forest.
pulindavākyād āsādya sārthaṃ daivātkathaṃcana / iha prāpto 'hamadrākṣaṃ piśācānsubahūnamūn // anyonyālāpameteṣāṃ dūrādākarṇya śikṣitā / mayā piśācabhāṣeyaṃ maunamokṣasya kāraṇam //	A hint given by a Pulinda enabled me to find a caravan, and so somehow or other, by the special favour of destiny, I managed to arrive here, and beheld this host of Piśācas, and by hearing from a distance their conversation with one another, I have contrived to learn this Paiśācha language,[6] which has enabled me to break my vow of silence.
upagamya tataścaitāṃ tvāṃ śrutvojjayinīgatam / pratipālitavānasmi yāvadabhyāgato bhavān //	I then made use of it to ask after you, and hearing that you had gone to Ujjayinī, I waited here until your return;
dṛṣṭvā tvāṃ svāgataṃ kṛtvā caturthyā bhūtabhāṣayā / mayā jātiḥ smṛtetyeṣa vṛttānto me 'tra janmani //	on beholding you I welcomed you in the fourth language (the speech of the Piśācas), and then I called to mind my origin. This is the story of my adventure in this birth.
evamukte guṇāḍhyena kāṇabhūtiruvāca tam / tvadāgamo mayā jñāto yathādya niśi tacchṛṇu //	[M] (main story line continued) When Guṇāḍhya had said this, Kāṇabhūti said to him: “Hear how your arrival was made known to me last night.
rākṣaso bhūtivarmākhyo divyadṛṣṭiḥ sakhāsti me / gatavānasmi codyānamujjayinyāṃ tadāspadam //	I have a friend, a Rākṣasa of the name of Bhūtivarman, who possesses heavenly insight, and I went to a garden in Ujjayinī, where he resides.
tatrāsau nijaśāpāntaṃ prati pṛṣṭo mayābravīt / divā nāsti prabhāvo nāstiṣṭha rātrau vadāmyataḥ //	On my asking him when my own curse would come to an end, he said: ‘We have no power in the day;
tatheti cāhaṃ tatrasthaḥ prāptāyāṃ niśi valgatām / tamapṛcchaṃ prasaṅgena bhūtānāṃ harṣakāraṇam //	wait, and I will tell you at night.’ I consented, and when night came on I asked him earnestly the reason why goblins[7] delighted in disporting themselves, as they were doing.
purā viriñcasaṃvāde yaduktaṃ śaṃkareṇa tat / śṛṇu vacmīti māmuktvā bhūtivarmātha so 'bravīt //	Then Bhūtivarman said to me: ‘Listen; I will relate what I heard Śiva say in a conversation with Brahmā.
divā naiṣāṃ prabhāvo 'sti dhvastānāmarkatejasā / yakṣarakṣaḥpiśācānāṃ tena hṛṣyantyamī niśī // na pūjyante surā yatra na ca viprā yathocitam / bhujyate 'vidhinā vāpi tatraite prabhavanti ca //	Rākṣasas, Yakṣas, and Piśācas have no power in the day, being dazed with the brightness of the sun, therefore they delight in the night.[8] And where the gods are not worshipped, and the Brāhmans, in due form, and where men eat contrary to the holy law, there also they have power.
amāṃsabhakṣaḥ sādhvī vā yatra tatra na yāntyamī / śucīñ śūrān prabuddhāṃś ca nākrāmanti kadācana //	Where there is a man who abstains from flesh, or a virtuous woman, there they do not go.
ityuktvā me sa tatkālaṃ bhūtivarmābravītpunaḥ / gacchāgato guṇāḍhyaste śāpamokṣasya kāraṇam // śrutvaitadāgataścāsmi tvaṃ ca dṛṣṭo mayā prabho / kathayāmyadhunā tāṃ te puṣpadantoditāṃ kathām //	They never attack chaste men, heroes, and men awake.’[9] When he said this on that occasion Bhūtivarman continued: ‘Go, for Guṇāḍhya has arrived, the destined means of thy release from the curse.’ So hearing this, I have come, and I have seen thee, my lord. Now I will relate to thee that tale which Puṣpadanta told;
kiṃ tvekaṃ kautukaṃ me 'sti kathyatāṃ kena hetunā / sa puṣpadantas tvaṃ cāpi mālyavān iti viśrutaḥ // kāṇabhūteriti śrutvā guṇāḍhyastamabhāṣata / gaṅgātīre 'grahāro 'sti nāmnā bahusuvarṇakaḥ // tatra govindadattākhyo brāhmaṇo 'bhūdbahuśrutaḥ / tasya bhāryāgnidattā ca babhūva patidevatā //	but I feel curiosity on one point: tell me why he was called Puṣpadanta and thou Mālyavān.” Hearing this question from Kāṇabhūti, Guṇāḍhya said to him: On the bank of the Ganges there is a royal district granted to Brāhmans by royal charter, named Bahusuvarṇaka, and there lived there a very learned Brāhman named Govindadatta, and he had a wife, Agnidattā, who was devoted to her husband.
sa kālena dvijastasyāṃ pañca putrānajījanat / te ca mūrkhāḥ surūpāśca babhūvurabhimāninaḥ //	In course of time that Brāhman had five sons by her. And they, being handsome but stupid, grew up insolent fellows.
atha govindadattasya gṛhānatithirāyayau / vipro vaiśvānaro nāma vaiśvānara ivāparaḥ // govindadatte tatkālaṃ gṛhādapi bahiḥ sthite / tatputrāṇāmupāgatya kṛtaṃ tenābhivādanam //	Then a guest came to the house of Govindadatta, a Brāhman, Vaiśvānara by name, like a second god of fire.[10] As Govindadatta was away from home when he arrived, he came and saluted his sons, and they only responded to his salute with a laugh;
hāsamātraṃ ca taistasya kṛtaṃ pratyabhivādanam / tataḥ sa kopān nirgantuṃ prārebhe tadgṛhād dvijaḥ //	then that Brāhman in a rage prepared to depart from his house.
āgatenātha govindadattena sa tathāvidhaḥ / kruddhaḥ pṛṣṭo 'nunīto 'pi jagādaivaṃ dvijottamaḥ //	While he was in this state of wrath Govindadatta came, and asked the cause, and did his best to appease him;
putrāste patitā mūrkhāstatsaṃparkādbhavānapi / tasmānna bhokṣye tvadgehe prāyaścittaṃ nu me bhavet //	but the excellent Brāhman nevertheless spoke as follows:— “Your sons have become outcasts, as being blockheads, and you have lost caste by associating with them, therefore I will not eat in your house;
atha govindadattastamuvāca śapathottaram / na spṛśāmyapi jātvetānahaṃ kutanayāniti //	if I did so I should not be able to purify myself by any expiatory ceremony.” Then Govindadatta said to him with an oath: “I will never even touch these wicked sons of mine.” His hospitable wife also came and said the same to her guest;
tadbhāryāpi tathaivaitya tamuvācātithipriyā / tataḥ kathaṃcid ātithyaṃ tatra vaiśvānaro 'grahīt //	then Vaiśvānara was with difficulty induced to accept their hospitality.
taddṛṣṭvā devadattākhyastasyaikastanayastadā / abhūdrovindadattasya nairghṛṇyenānutāpavān // vyarthaṃ jīvitamālokya pitṛbhyāmatha dūṣitam / sanirvedaḥ sa tapase toṣayiṣyannumāpatim //	One of Govindadatta’s sons, named Devadatta, when he saw that, was grieved at his father’s sternness, and, thinking a life of no value which was thus branded by his parents, went in a state of despondency to the hermitage of Badarikā to perform penance;
tataḥ parṇāśanaḥ pūrvaṃ dhūmapaś cāpy anantaram / tasthau cirāya tapase toṣayiṣyann umāpatim // dadau ca darśanaṃ tasya śaṃbhustīvrataporjitaḥ / tasyaivānucaratvaṃ ca sa vavre varamīśvarāt //	there he first ate leaves, and afterwards he fed only on smoke, persevering in a long course of austerities[11] in order to propitiate the husband of Umā.[12] So Śambhu,[12] won over by his severe austerities, manifested himself to him, and he craved a boon from the god, that he might ever attend upon him.
vidyāḥ prāpnuhi bhogāṃśca bhuvi bhuṅkṣva tatastava / bhavitābhimataṃ sarvamiti śaṃbhustamādiśat // tataḥ sa gatvā vidyārthī puraṃ pāṭaliputrakam / siṣeve vedakumbhākhyamupādhyāyaṃ yathāvidhi //	Śambhu thus commanded him: “Acquire learning, and enjoy pleasures on the earth, and after that thou shalt attain all thy desire.” Then he, eager for learning, went to the city of Pāṭaliputra, and according to custom waited on an instructor named Vedakumbha.
tatrasthaṃ tamupādhyāyapatnī jātu smarāturā / haṭhādvrave bata strīṇāṃ cañcalāścittavṛttayaḥ //	When he was there, the wife of his preceptor, distracted by passion, which had arisen in her heart, made violent love to him. Alas! the fancies of women are ever inconstant.
tena saṃtyajya taṃ deśamanaṅgakṛtaviplavaḥ / sa devadattaḥ prayayau pratiṣṭhānamatadritaḥ //	Accordingly Devadatta left that place, as his studies had been thus interfered with by the God of Love, and went to Pratiṣṭhāna with unwearied zeal.
tatra vṛddhamupādhyāyaṃ vṛddhayā bhāryayānvitam / mantrasvāmyākhyamabhyarthya vidyāḥ samyagadhītavān //	There he repaired to an old preceptor named Mantrasvāmin, with an old wife, and acquired a perfect knowledge of the sciences.
kṛtavidyaṃ ca taṃ tatra dadarśa nṛpateḥ sutā / suśarmākhyasya subhagaṃ śrīrnāma śrīr ivācyutam //	And after he had acquired learning the daughter of the King Suśarman, Śrī by name, cast eyes upon the handsome youth, as the goddess Śrī upon Viṣṇu.
so 'pi tāṃ dṛṣṭavān kanyāṃ sthitāṃ vātayanopari / viharantīṃ vimānena candrasyevādhidevatām //	He also beheld that maiden at a window, looking like the presiding goddess of the moon, roaming through the air in a magic chariot.
baddhāviva tayānyonyaṃ māraśṛṅkhalayā dṛśā / nāpasartuṃ samarthau tau babhūvaturubhāvapi //	Those two were, as it were, fastened together by that look which was the chain of love, and were unable to separate.
sātha tasyaikayāṅgulyā mūrtayeva smarājñayā / ito nikaṭamehīti saṃjñāṃ cakre nṛpātmajā //	The king’s daughter made him a sign to come near with one finger, looking like love’s command in fleshly form.
tataḥ samīpaṃ tasyāśca yayāvantaḥpurācca saḥ / sā ca cikṣepa dantena puṣpamādāya taṃ prati //	Then he came near her, and she came out of the women’s apartments, and took with her teeth a flower and threw it down to him.
saṃjñāmetāmajānāno gūḍhāṃ rājasutākṛtām / sa kartavyavimūḍhaḥ sann upādhyāyagṛhaṃ yayau //	He, not understanding this mysterious sign [also see notes on sign-language] made by the princess, puzzled as to what he ought to do, went home to his preceptor.
luloṭha tatra dharaṇau na kiṃcidvaktumīśvaraḥ / tāpena dahyamāno 'ntarmūkaḥ prabhuṣito yathā //	There he rolled on the ground unable to utter a word, being consumed within with burning pain, like one dumb and distracted;
vitarkya kāmajaiścihnairupādhyāyena dhīmatā / yuktyā pṛṣṭaḥ kathaṃcicca yathāvṛttaṃ śaśaṃsa saḥ //	his wise preceptor guessing what was the matter by these love symptoms, artfully questioned him, and at last he was with difficulty persuaded to tell the whole story.
tadbuddhvā tamupādhyāyo vidagdho vākyamabravīt / dantena puṣpaṃ muñcantyā tayā saṃjñā kṛtā tava // yadetatpuṣpadantākhyaṃ puṣpāḍhyaṃ suramandiram / tatrāgatya pratīkṣethāḥ sāṃprataṃ gamyatāmiti //	Then the clever preceptor guessed the riddle, and said to him[13]: “By letting drop a flower with her tooth she made a sign to you that you were to go to this temple rich in flowers, called Puṣpadanta, and wait there;
śrutveti jñānasaṃjñārthaḥ sa tatyāja śucaṃ yuvā / tato devagṛhasyāntastasya gatvā sthito 'bhavat //	so you had better go now.” When he heard this and knew the meaning of the sign, the youth forgot his grief. Then he went into that temple and remained there.
sāpyaṣṭamīṃ samuddiśya tatra rājasutā yayau / ekaiva devaṃ draṣṭuṃ ca garbhāgāramathāviśat //	The princess on her part also went there, giving as an excuse that it was the eighth day of the month, and then entered the inner shrine in order to present herself alone before the god;
dṛṣṭo 'tra dvārapaṭṭasya paścātso 'tha priyastayā / gṛhītānena cotthāya sā kaṇṭhe sahasā tataḥ //	then she touched her lover, who was behind the panel of the door, and he suddenly springing up threw his arms round her neck. She exclaimed: “This is strange;
citraṃ tvayā kathaṃ jñātā sā saṃjñetyudite tayā / upādhyāyena sā jñātā na mayeti jagāda saḥ // muñca māmavidagdhastvamityuktvā tatkṣaṇātkrudhā / mantrabhedabhayātsātha rājakanyā tato yayau //	how did you guess the meaning of that sign of mine?” He replied: “It was my preceptor that found it out, not I.” Then the princess flew into a passion and said, “Let me go; you are a dolt,” and immediately rushed out of the temple, fearing her secret would be discovered.
so 'pi gatvā vivikte tāṃ dṛṣṭanaṣṭāṃ smaran priyām / devadatto viyogāgnivigalajjīvito 'bhavat //	Devadatta on his part went away, and thinking in solitude on his beloved, who was no sooner seen than lost to his eyes, was in such a state that the taper of his life was well-nigh melted away in the fire of bereavement.
dṛṣṭvā taṃ tādṛśaṃ śaṃbhuḥ prākprasannaḥ kilādiśat / gaṇaṃ pañcaśikhaṃ nāma tasyābhīpsitasiddhaye //	Śiva, who had been before propitiated by him, commanded an attendant of his, of the name of Pañcaśikha, to procure for him the desire of his heart.
sa cagatya samāśvāsya strīveṣaṃ taṃ gaṇottamaḥ / akārayatsvayaṃ cābhūdvṛddhabrāhmaṇarūpadhṛt //	That excellent Gaṇa thereupon came and consoled him, and caused him to assume the dress of a woman, and he himself wore the semblance of an aged Brāhman.
tatastena samaṃ gatvā taṃ suśarmamahīpatim / janakaṃ sudṛśastasyāḥ sa jagāda gaṇāgraṇīḥ //	Then that worthy Gaṇa went with him to King Suśarman, the father of that bright-eyed one, and said to him: “My son has been sent away somewhere,[14] I go to seek him;
putro me proṣitaḥ kvāpi tamanveṣṭuṃ vrajāmyaham / tanme snuṣeyaṃ niḥkṣepo rājansaṃprati rakṣyatām // tacchrutvā śāpabhītena tenādāya suśarmaṇā / svakanyāntaḥpure gupte strīti saṃsthāpite yuvā //	accordingly I deposit with thee this daughter-in-law of mine; keep her safely, O king.” Hearing that, King Suśarman, afraid of a Brāhman’s curse, took the young man and placed him in his daughter’s guarded seraglio, supposing him to be a woman.
tataḥ pañcaśikhe yāte svapriyāntaḥpure vasan / strīveṣaḥ sa dvijastasyāvisrambhāspadatāṃ yayau //	Then after the departure of Pañcaśikha the Brāhman dwelt in woman’s clothes in the seraglio of his beloved, and became her trusted confidant.
ekadā cotsukā rātrau tenātmānaṃ prakāśya sā / guptaṃ gāndharvavidhinā pariṇītā nṛpāmajā // tasyāṃ ca dhṛtagarbhāyāṃ taṃ dvijaṃ sa gaṇottamaḥ / smṛtamātrāgato rātrau tato 'naiṣīdalakṣitam //	Once on a time the princess was full of regretful longing at night, so he discovered himself to her and secretly married her by the gāndharva form of marriage.[15] And when she became pregnant that excellent Gaṇa came on his thinking of him only, and carried him away at night without its being perceived.
tatastasya samutsārya yūnaḥ strīveṣamāśu tam / prātaḥ pañcaśikhaḥ so 'bhūtpūrvavadbrāhmaṇākṛtiḥ //	Then he quickly rent off from the young man his woman’s dress, and in the morning Pañcaśikha resumed the semblance of a Brāhman;
tenaiva saha gatvā ca suśarmanṛpam abhyadhāt / adya prāpto mayā rājan putras tad dehi me snuṣām //	and going with the young man to the King Suśarman he said: “O king, I have this day found my son;
tataḥ sa rājā tāṃ buddhvā rātrau kvāpi palāyitām / tacchāpabhayasaṃbhrānto mantribhya idamabravīt //	so give me back my daughter-in-law.” Then the king, supposing that she had fled somewhere at night, alarmed at the prospect of being cursed by the Brāhman, said this to his ministers: “This is no Brāhman;
na vipro 'yamayaṃ ko'pi devo madvañcanāgataḥ / evaṃprāyā bhavantīha vṛttāntāḥ satataṃ yataḥ //	this is some god come to deceive me, for such things often happen in this world.
tathā ca pūrvaṃ rājābhūttapasvī karuṇāparaḥ / dātā dhīraḥ śibirnāma sarvasattvābhayapradaḥ //	“So in former times there was a king named Śivi, self-denying, compassionate, generous, resolute, the protector of all creatures;
taṃ vañcayitumindro 'tha kṛtvā śyenavapuḥ svayam / māyākapotavapuṣaṃ dharmam anvapatad drutam //	and in order to beguile him Indra assumed the shape of a hawk, and swiftly pursued Dharma,[16] who by magic had transformed himself into a dove.
kapotaśca bhayādgatvā śiberaṅkamaśiśriyat / manuṣyavācā śyeno 'tha sa taṃ rājānamabravīt //	The dove in terror went and took refuge in the bosom of Śivi. Then the hawk addressed the king with a human voice: ‘O king, this is my natural food;
rājan bhakṣyam idaṃ muñca kapotaṃ kṣudhitasya me / anyathā māṃ mṛtaṃ viddhi kas te dharmas tato bhavet // tataḥ śibiruvācainameṣa me śaraṇāgataḥ / atyājyastaddadāmyanyanmāṃsametatsamaṃ tava // śyeno jagāda yadyevamātmamāṃsaṃ prayaccha me / tateti tatprahṛṣṭaḥ sansa rājā pratyapadyata //	surrender the dove to me, for I am hungry. Know that my death will immediately follow if you refuse my prayer; in that case where will be your righteousness?’ Then Śivi said to the god: ‘This creature has fled to me for protection, and I cannot abandon it, therefore I will give you an equal weight of some other kind of flesh.’ The hawk said: ‘If this be so, then give me your own flesh.’ The king, delighted, consented to do so.
yathā yathā ca māṃsaṃ svamutkṛtyāropayannṛpaḥ / tathā tathā tulāyāṃ sa kapoto 'bhyadhiko 'bhavat //	But as fast as he cut off his flesh and threw it on the scale, the dove seemed to weigh more and more in the balance.
tataḥ śarīraṃ sakalaṃ tulāṃ rājādhyaropayat / sādhu sādhu śamaṃ tvetaddivyā vāgudabhūttataḥ // indradharmau tatastyaktvā rūpaṃ śyenakapotayoḥ / tuṣṭāvakṣatadehaṃ taṃ rājānaṃ cakratuḥ śibim //	Then the king threw his whole body on to the scale, and thereupon a celestial voice was heard: ‘Well done! This is equal in weight to the dove.’ Then Indra and Dharma abandoned the form of hawk and dove and, being highly pleased, restored the body of King Śivi whole as before, and after bestowing on him many other blessings they both disappeared.
dattvā cāsmai varānanyāṃstāvantardhānamīyatuḥ / evaṃ māmapi ko 'pyeṣa devo jijñāsurāgataḥ // ityuktvā sacivānsvairaṃ sa suśarmā mahīpatiḥ / tamuvāca bhayaprahvo viprarūpaṃ gaṇottamam //	In the same way this Brāhman is some god that has come to prove me.”[17] Having said this to his ministers, that King Suśarman of his own motion said to that excellent Gaṇa that had assumed the form of a Brāhman, prostrating himself before him in fear: “Spare me.
abhayaṃ dehi sādyaiva snuṣā te hāritā niśi / māyayaiva gatā kvāpi rakṣyamāṇāpyaharniśam // kṛcchrātsa dayayevātha viprarūpo gaṇo 'bravīt / tarhi putrāya rājanme dehi svāṃ tanayāmiti // tacchrutvā śāpabhītena rājñā tasmai nijā sutā / sā dattā devadattāya tataḥ pañcaśikho yayau //	She has been taken somewhere or other by magic arts, though guarded night and day.” Then the Gaṇa, who had assumed the Brāhman’s semblance, pretending to be with difficulty won over to pity him, said: “If this be so, king, give thy daughter in marriage to my son.” When he heard this, the king, afraid of being cursed, gave his own daughter to Devadatta; then Pañcaśikha departed.
devadatto 'pi tāṃ bhūyaḥ prakāśaṃ prāpya vallabhām / jajṛmbhe 'nanyaputrasya śvaśurasya vibhūtiṣu //	Then Devadatta having recovered his beloved, and that in an open manner, flourished in the power and splendour of his father-in-law, who had no son but him.
kālena tasya putraṃ ca dauhitramabiṣicya saḥ / rājye mahīdharaṃ nāma suśarmā śiśriye vanam //	And in course of time Suśarman anointed the son of his daughter by Devadatta, Mahīdhara by name, as successor in his room, and retired to the forest.
tato dṛṣṭvā sutaiśvaryaṃ kṛtārthaḥ sa tapovanam / rājaputryā tayā sākaṃ devadatto 'pyaśiśriyat //	Then having seen the prosperity of his son, Devadatta considered that he had attained all his objects, and he too, with the princess, retired to the forest.
tatrārādhyaḥ punaḥ śaṃbhuṃ tyaktvā martyakalevaram / tatprasādena tasyaiva gaṇabhāvamupāgataḥ //	There he again propitiated Śiva, and having laid aside his mortal body, by the special favour of the god he attained the position of a Gaṇa.
priyādantojjhitātpuṣpātsaṃjñāṃ na jñātavānyataḥ / ataḥ sa puṣpadantākhyaḥ saṃpanno gaṇasaṃsadi //	Because he did not understand the sign given by the flower dropped from the tooth of his beloved, therefore he became known by the name of Puṣpadanta in the assembly of the Gaṇas.
tadbhāryā ca pratīhārī devyā jātā jayābhidhā / itthaṃ sa puṣpadantākhyo madākhyāmadhunā śṛṇu //	And his wife became a doorkeeper in the house of the goddess, under the name of Jayā. This is how he came to be called Puṣpadanta. Now hear the origin of my name.
yaḥ sa govindadattākhyo devadattapitā dvijaḥ / tasyaiva somadattākhyaḥ putro 'hamabhavaṃ purā //	Long ago I was a son of that same Brāhman called Govindadatta, the father of Devadatta, and my name was Somadatta.
tenaiva manyunā gatvā tapaścāhaṃ himācale / akārṣaṃ bahubhirmālyaiḥ śaṃkaraṃ nandayansadā //	I left my home indignant for the same reason as Devadatta, and I performed austerities on the Himālaya, continually striving to propitiate Śiva with offerings of many garlands.
tathaiva prakaṭībhūtātprasannādinduśekharāt / yaktānyabhogalipsena tadgaṇatvaṃ mayā vṛtam //	The god of the moony crest, being pleased, revealed himself to me in the same way as he did to my brother, and I chose the privilege of attending upon him as a Gaṇa, not being desirous of lower pleasures.
yaḥ pūjito 'smi bhavatā svayamāhṛtena mālyena durgavanabhūmisamudbhavena / tanmālyavāniti bhaviṣyasi me gaṇas tvam ityādiśac ca sa vibhurgirijāpatirmām // atha martyavapurvimucya puṇyāṃ sahasā tadgaṇatāmahaṃ prapannaḥ / iti dhūrjaṭinā kṛtaṃ prasādād abhidhānaṃ mama mālyavānitīdam //	The husband of the daughter of the mountain, that mighty god, thus addressed me: “Because I have been worshipped by thee with garlands of flowers growing in trackless forest regions, brought with thy own hand, therefore thou shalt be one of my Gaṇas, and shalt bear the name of Mālyavān.” Then I cast off my mortal frame and immediately attained the holy state of an attendant on the god.
so 'haṃ gataḥ punarihādya manuṣyabhāvaṃ śāpena śailaduhiturbata kāṇabhūte / tanme kathāṃ harakṛtāṃ kathayādhunā tvaṃ yenāvayorbhavati śāpadaśopaśāntiḥ //	And I, that very Mālyavān, have once more, O Kāṇabhūti, been degraded to the state of a mortal, as thou seest, owing to the curse of the daughter of the mountain; therefore do thou now tell me the tale told by Śiva, in order that the state of curse of both of us may cease.
iti mahākaviśrīsomadevabhaṭṭaviracite kathāsaritsāgare kathāpīṭhalambake saptamas taraṅgaḥ / aṣṭamas taraṅgaḥ / evaṃ guṇāḍhyavacasā sātha saptakathāmayi / svabhāṣayā kathā divyā kathitā kāṇabhūtinā // tathaiva ca guṇāḍhyena paiśācyā bhāṣayā tayā / nibaddhā saptabhir varṣair granthalakṣāṇi sapta sā //	[Additional note: the gāndharva form of marriage] [M] (main story line continued) IN accordance with this request of Guṇāḍhya that heavenly tale consisting of seven stories was told by Kāṇabhūti in his own language, and Guṇāḍhya for his part using the same Paiśācha language threw them into seven hundred thousand couplets in seven years;
maitāṃ vidyādharā hārṣuriti tāmātmaśoṇitaiḥ / aṭavyāṃ maṣyabhāvācca lilekha sa mahākaviḥ //	and that great poet, for fear that the Vidyādharas should steal his composition, wrote it with his own blood in the forest, not possessing ink.
tathā ca śrotumāyātaiḥ siddhavidyādharādibhiḥ / nirantaramabhūttatra savitānamivāmbaram //	And so the Vidyādharas, Siddhas and other demigods came to hear it, and the heaven above where Kāṇabhūti was reciting was, as it were, continually covered with a canopy.
guṇāḍhyena nibaddhāṃ ca tāṃ dṛṣṭvaiva mahākathām / jagāma muktaśāpaḥ san kāṇabhūtir nijāṃ gatim //	And Kāṇabhūti, when he had seen that great tale composed by Guṇāḍhya, was released from his curse and went to his own place.
piśācā ye 'pi tatrāsannanye tatsahacāriṇaḥ / te 'pi prāpurdivaṃ sarve divyamākarṇya tāṃ kathām //	There were also other Piśācas that accompanied him in his wanderings: they too, all of them, attained heaven, having heard that heavenly tale.
pratiṣṭhāṃ prāpaṇīyaiṣā pṛthivyāṃ me bṛhatkathā / ayamartho 'pi me devyā śāpāntoktāvudīritaḥ //	Then that great poet Guṇāḍhya began to reflect: “I must make this Great Tale[1] of mine current on the earth, for that is the condition that the goddess mentioned when she revealed how my course would end.
tatkathaṃ prāpayāmyenāṃ kasmai tāvatsamarpaye / iti cācintayattatra sa guṇāḍhyo mahākaviḥ // athaiko guṇadevākhyo nandidevābhidhaḥ paraḥ / tamūcaturupādhyāyaṃ śiṣyāvanugatāvubhau // tatkāvyasyārpaṇasthānamekaḥ śrīsātavāhanaḥ / rasiko hi vahetkāvyaṃ puṣpāmodamivānilaḥ // evamastviti tau śiṣyāvantikaṃ tasya bhūpateḥ / prāhiṇotpustakaṃ dattvā guṇāḍhyo guṇaśālinau //	Then how shall I make it current? To whom shall I give it?” Then his two disciples who had followed him, one of whom was called Guṇadeva, and the other Nandideva, said to him: “The glorious Sātavāhana alone is a fit person to give this poem to, for, being a man of taste, he will diffuse the poem far and wide, as the wind diffuses the perfume of the flower.” “So be it,” said Guṇāḍhya, and gave the book to those two accomplished disciples and sent them to that king with it;
svayaṃ ca gatvā tatraiva pratiṣṭhānapurādbahiḥ / kṛtasaṃketa udyāne tasthau devīvinirmite //	and went himself to that same Pratiṣṭhāna, but remained outside the city in the garden planted by the goddess, where he arranged that they should meet him.
gacchiṣyābhyāṃ ca gatvā tatsātavāhanabhūpateḥ / guṇāḍhyakṛtireṣeti darśitaṃ kāvyapustakam //	And his disciples went and showed the poem to King Sātavāhana, telling him at the same time that it was the work of Guṇāḍhya.
piśācabhāṣāṃ tāṃ śrutvā tau ca dṛṣṭvā tadākṛtī / vidyāmadena sāsūyaṃ sa rājaivam abhāṣata // pramāṇaṃ saptalakṣāṇi paiśācaṃ nīrasaṃ vacaḥ / śoṇitenākṣaranyāso dhikpiśācakathāmimām //	When he heard that Paiśācha language and saw that they had the appearance of Piśācas, that king, led astray by pride of learning, said with a sneer: “The seven hundred thousand couplets are a weighty authority, but the Paiśācha language is barbarous, and the letters are written in blood.
tataḥ pustakamādāya gatvā tābhyāṃ yathāgatam / śiṣyābhyāṃ tadguṇāḍhyāya yathāvṛttamakathyata //	Away with this Paiśācha tale.” Then the two pupils took the book and returned by the way which they had come, and told the whole circumstance to Guṇāḍhya.
guṇāḍhyo 'pi tadākaṇya sadyaḥ khedavaśo 'bhavat / tattvajñena kṛtāvajñaḥ ko nāmāntarna tapyate // saśiṣyaśca tato gatvā nātidūraṃ śiloccayam / viviktaramyabhūbhāgamagnikuṇḍaṃ vyadhātpuraḥ //	Guṇāḍhya for his part, when he heard it, was immediately overcome with sorrow. Who indeed is not inly grieved when scorned by a competent authority? Then he went with his disciples to a craggy hill at no great distance, in an unfrequented but pleasant spot, and first prepared a consecrated fire cavity.
tatrāgnau pattramekaikaṃ śiṣyābhyāṃ sāśru vīkṣitaḥ / vācayitvā sa cikṣepa śrāvayanmṛgapakṣiṇaḥ //	Then he took the leaves one by one, and after he had read them aloud to the beasts and birds, he flung them into the fire, while his disciples looked on with tearful eyes.
naravāhanadattasya caritaṃ śiṣyayoḥ kṛte / granthalakṣaṃ kathāmekāṃ varjayitvā tadīpsitām //	But he reserved one story, consisting of one hundred thousand couplets, containing the history of Naravāhanadatta, for the sake of his two disciples, as they particularly fancied it.
tasmiṃśca tāṃ kathāṃ divyāṃ paṭhatyapi dahatyapi / parityaktatṛṇāhārāḥ śṛṇvantaḥ sāśrulocanāḥ // āsannabhyetya tatraiva niścalā baddhamaṇḍalāḥ / nikhilāḥ khalu sāraṅgavarāhamahiṣādayaḥ // atrāntare ca rājābhūdasvasthaḥ sātavāhanaḥ / doṣaṃ cāsyāvadanvaidyāḥ śuṣkamāṃsopabhogajam //	And while he was reading out and burning that heavenly tale, all the deer, boars, buffaloes and other wild animals came there, leaving their pasturage, and formed a circle round him, listening with tears in their eyes, unable to quit the spot.[2] In the meanwhile King Sātavāhana fell sick. And the physicians said that his illness was due to eating meat wanting in nutritive qualities.
ākṣiptāstannimittaṃ ca sūpakārā babhāṣire / asmākamīdṛśaṃ māṃsaṃ dadate lubdhakā iti // pṛṣṭāśca lubdhakā ūcurnātidūre girāvitaḥ / paṭhitvā patramekaikaṃ ko 'pyagnau kṣipati dvijaḥ //	And when the cooks were scolded for it they said: “The hunters bring in to us flesh of this kind.” And when the hunters were taken to task they said: “On a hill not very far from here there is a Brāhman reading, who throws into a fire every leaf as soon as he has read it;
tatsametya nirāhārāḥ śṛṇvanti prāṇino 'khilāḥ / nānyato yānti tenaiṣāṃ śuṣkaṃ māṃsamidaṃ kṣudhā //	so all the animals go there and listen, without ever grazing; they never wander anywhere else;
iti vyādhavacaḥ śrutvā kṛtvā tāneva cāgrataḥ / svayaṃ sa kautukādrājā guṇāḍhyasyāntikaṃ yayau // dadarśa taṃ samākīrṇaṃ jaṭābhirvanavāsataḥ / praśāntaśeṣaśāpāgnidhūmikābirivābhitaḥ //	consequently this flesh of theirs is wanting in nutritive properties on account of their going without food.” When he heard this speech of the hunters he made them show him the way, and out of curiosity went in person to see Guṇāḍhya, and he beheld him, owing to his forest life, overspread with matted locks that looked like the smoke of the fire of his curse, that was almost extinguished.
athainaṃ pratyabhijñāya sabāṣpamṛgamadhyagam / namaskṛtya ca papraccha taṃ vṛttāntaṃ mahīpatiḥ //	Then the king recognised him as he stood in the midst of the weeping animals, and after he had respectfully saluted him, he asked him for an explanation of all the circumstances.
so 'pi svaṃ puṣpadantasya rājñe śāpādiceṣṭitam / jñānī kathāvatāraṃ tamācakhyau bhūtabhāṣayā //	That wise Brāhman then related to the king in the language of the demons his own history as Puṣpadanta, giving an account of the curse and all the circumstances which originated the descent of the tale to earth.
tato gaṇāvatāraṃ taṃ matvā pādānato nṛpaḥ / yayāce tāṃ kathāṃ tasmāddivyāṃ haramukhodgatām //	Then the king, discovering that he was an incarnation of a Gaṇa, bowed at his feet, and asked him for that celestial tale that had issued from the mouth of Śiva.
athovāca sa taṃ bhūpaṃ guṇāḍhyaḥ sātavāhanam / rājan ṣaḍgranthalakṣāṇi mayā dagdhāni ṣaṭkathāḥ //	Then Guṇāḍhya said to that King Sātavāhana: “O king! I have burnt six tales containing six hundred thousand couplets;
lakṣamekamidaṃ tvasti kathaikā saiva gṛhyatām / macchiṣyau tava cātraitau vyākhyātārau bhaviṣyataḥ // ityuktvā nṛpamāmantrya tyaktvā yogena tāṃ tanum / guṇāḍhyaḥ śāpanirmuktaḥ prāpa divyaṃ nijaṃ padam //	but there is one tale consisting of a hundred thousand couplets, take that,[3] and these two pupils of mine shall explain it to you.” So spake Guṇāḍhya and took leave of the king, and then by strength of devotion laid aside his earthly body and, released from the curse, ascended to his own heavenly home.
atha tāṃ guṇāḍhyadattāmādāya kathāṃ bṛhatkathāṃ nāmnā / nṛpatiragānnijanagaraṃ naravāhanadattacaritamayīm //	Then the king took that tale which Guṇāḍhya had given, called Bṛhat Kathā, containing the adventures of Naravāhanadatta, and went to his own city.
guṇadevanandidevau tatra ca tau tatkathākaveḥ śiṣyau / kṣitikanakavastravāhanabhavanadhanaiḥ saṃvibheje saḥ //	And there he bestowed on Guṇadeva and Nandideva, the pupils of the poet who composed that tale, lands, gold, garments, beasts of burden, palaces and treasures.
