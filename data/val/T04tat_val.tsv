aśeṣa śakti pracitāt pradhānāt eva kevalāt | kārya bhedāḥ pravarttante tad rūpāḥ eva bhāvataḥ || 	It is out of prakṛti (primordial matter) itself alone, as equipped with all potencies, that the various products evolve, really having their essence in that same matter.” 
aśeṣa śakti pracitāt pradhānāt eva kevalāt | kārya bhedāḥ pravarttante tad rūpāḥ eva bhāvataḥ || 	It is out of prakṛti (primordial matter) itself alone, as equipped with all potencies, that the various products evolve, really having their essence in that same matter.” 
yadi tu asat bhavet kāryam kāraṇa ātmani śaktitaḥ  | kartum tat na eva śakyeta nairupyāt viyat abja vat || 	If the effect were non-existent, potentially, in the form of the cause,—then it could not be produced; because it would have no form at all, being like the sky-lotus.” 
kasmāt ca niyatāni eva śāli bīja ādi bhedataḥ | upādānāni gṛhṇanti tulye asattve aparam na tu || 	How is it that people have recourse to only specific causes, in the shape of such diverse things as the paddy-seed and the like, and not any other,—even though the nonexistence (of the desired effect or product) is equal (everywhere)?” 
sarvam ca sarvatas bhāvāt bhavet utpatti dharmakam | tādātmya vigamasya iha sarvasmin aviśeṣataḥ || 	Everything likely to be produced would be produced from everything; because the negation of co-essentiality is equally present in everything.” 
śaktīnām niyamāt eṣām na evam iti api anuttaram  | śakyam eva yatas kāryam śaktāḥ kurvanti hetavaḥ || 	Because the potencies of these things are restricted in their scope, therefore it is not as has been urged; hence it does not answer our argument. because potent causes produce only such effect as is amenable to their potency.” 
akārya atiśayam yat tu nīrūpam avikāri ca | vikṛtau ātma hāni āpteḥ tat kriyeta katham nu taiḥ || 	That to which no peculiarity can be attributed, which is eormless and unmodipiable,—how could such a thing be produced by causes,—when any modification would involve the loss of its very essence?” 
kāryasya evam ayogāt ca kim kurvat kāraṇam bhavet | tatas kāraṇa bhāvaḥ api bīja ādeḥ na vikalpate || 	Thus the effect being impossible, what would that be by producing which anything would be a cause? as a consequence, it cannot be possible to admit the causal character of even such things as the seed and the like.” 
sukha ādi anvitam etat ca vyaktam vyaktam samīkṣyate | prasāda tāpa dainya ādi kāryasya iha upalabdhitaḥ || 	All that is Manifest is clearly known to be homogeneous with Pleasure and the rest, from the fact of the Effect being found to be the product of Satisfaction, Irritation and Dejection, etc.” 
tatas tad maya sambhūtam tad jāti anvaya darśanāt | kuṭa ādi bhedavat tat ca pradhānam iti kāpilāḥ || 	Thus, the whole (manifest) must be taken as having emanated from something made up of the said (pleasure, etc,),—because the said generic character is found present in it,—just as in the case of the jar and other things; and this something is primordial matter”,—so say the followers of Kapila 
tat atra sudhiyaḥ prāhuḥ tulyā satve api codanā | yat tasyām uttaram vaḥ syāt tat tulyam sudhiyām api || 	In answer to this, the wise ones hectare that the argument that has been urged (by the sāṃkhya against the doctrine that the effect is non-existent prior to its production) is equally applicable to the doctrine of the existence of the effect. and the answer that you would have to that argument would equally aptly be the answer of the wise ones also 
yadi dadhi ādayaḥ santi dugdha ādi ātmasu sarvathā | teṣām satām kim utpādyam hetu ādi sadṛśa ātmanām || 	If the curd and other effects are already wholly existent in the essence of (their causes) milk and the rest,—then, inasmuch as they would be exactly like the cause, etc. in their essence, what of theirs would be there that would have to be produced? A) The said effect cannot be produced by the cause,—because it already exists,—like the cause and the spirit 
hetu janyam na tat kāryam sattātaḥ hetu vitti vat | atas na abhimataḥ hetuḥ asādhya tvāt parātma vat || 	B) Thus also what is postulated cannot be the cause,—because there is nothing that can be brought about by it,—just like the other thing 
atha asti atiśayaḥ kaścid abhivyakti ādi lakṣaṇaḥ | yam hetavaḥ prakurvāṇāḥ na yānti vacanīya tām || 	It might be urged that “there is some peculiar feature, something in the shape of manifestation and the like,—by producing which, causes might cease to be defamed (as futile)” 
prāk āsīt yadi asau evam na kiṃcid dattam uttaram | no ced saḥ asat katham tebhyaḥ prādurbhāvam samaśnute || 	If this (peculiar feature) existed previously, then the objection is not answered; if, however, it did not exist previously, then, being- non-existent, how could it be produced out of the causes? 
na atas sādhyam samasti iti na upādāna parigrahaḥ | niyatāt api naḥ janma na ca śaktiḥ na ca kriyā || 	For the same reason, if there is nothing to be produced, there would be no ‘recourse to the cause’,—nor would there be any production out of even a specific cause,—nor would there be any ‘efficiency’, nor any ‘operation’ (of the cause) 
sarva ātmanā ca niṣpatteḥ na kāryam iha kiṃcana | kāraṇa vyapadeśaḥ api tasmāt na eva upapadyate || 	Inasmuch as every effect, is already there in its entirety, there can be nothing ‘to be produced’ (an effect); consequently, the very name ‘cause’ cannot be logical 
sarvam ca sādhanam vṛttam viparyāsa nivartakam  | niścaya utpādakam ca idam na tathā yukti saṅgatam || 	All Means (of Cognition), when operative, serve to set aside Wrong Cognition and to produce Definitely Certain Cognition; this would not be compatible with reason (under the Sāṃkhya theory) 
na sandeha viparyāsau nivartyau sarvadā sthiteḥ  | na api niścaya janma asti tatas eva vṛthak akhilam || 	The doubt and the misconception cannot be set aside, as they would be always there. nor is the producing op definitely certain cognition possible, for the very same reason. hence all that has been said is futile 
athā api niścayaḥ abhūtaḥ samutpadyeta sādhanāt | nanu tena eva sarve amī bhaveyuḥ vyabhicāriṇaḥ || 	If, on the other hand, (it be held that) the definite cognition that would be produced would be one that has not been there,—then, this one instance (of the effect being non-existent) would invalidate all those reasons (that have been set forth by the sāṃkhya) 
avyaktaḥ vyakti bhāktebhyaḥ iti ced vyaktiḥ asya kā | na rūpa atiśaya utpattiḥ avibhāgāt asaṅgateḥ || 	If it be held that—“the effect, which has been unmanifested (latent, in the cause), acquires manifestation through the causes”,—then (the question is) what is this manifestation of the effect?—it cannot consist in'the appearance (production) of a peculiarity in its nature; because of non-differentiation and non-connection 
na tad viṣaya saṃvittiḥ na upalambha āvṛti kṣayaḥ | nitya tvāt upalambhasya dvitīyasya api asaṃbhavāt || 	The ‘Manifestation’ of the Effect cannot consist in its Apprehension; nor in the removal of what was obstructing its Apprehension; because the Apprehension is a constant factor, and also because there is no possibility of a second (Apprehension) 
traiguṇyasya avibhede api na sarvam sarva kārakam | yadvat tadvat asatve api na sarvam sarva kārakam || 	Just as (under the sāṃkhya theory),—even though, on the ground of all things being constituted by the Three Attributes, there is no differentiation among them, and yet everything (Cause) does not produce everything (Effect),—in the same manner, even though the Effect is non-existent (before the Causal Operation), everything cannot produce everything 
avadhīnām aniṣpatteḥ niyatāḥ te na śaktayaḥ | satve tu niyamaḥ tāsām yuktaḥ sa avadhikaḥ na nu || 	Inasmuch as the presence of limits would re impossible for you, the potencies cannot be restricted. on the view of their being existent, on the other hand, their restriction would be right and proper as pertaining to the limits.” 
na evam teṣām aniṣpattyā mā abhūt śabdaḥ tathā aparam | sarva upādhi viviktasya vastu rūpasya na kṣatiḥ || 	It is not so; it may be that, on account of the absence of ‘limits’, there can be no such subsequent assertion as held by us. but there is no harm done to the nature of the thing itself which is entirely free from all restrictive adjuncts 
na nāma rūpam vastūnām vikalpāḥ vācakāḥ ca yat | viśva kalpāḥ pravarttante yathā abhyāsam abhedini || 	The name of things is not their ‘essence’ (nature, form); because all kinds of ‘conception’ and ‘verbal expression’ proceed through habit, with reference to the undifferentiated (immaculate) entity 
utpādaḥ vastu bhāvaḥ tu saḥ asatā na satā tathā  | sambadhyate kalpikayā kevalam tu asatā dhiyā || 	In reality, the ‘production’ (or a thing) consists in its becoming a thing; this ‘production’ cannot be related to what is existent, or with what is non-existent; it is related only to a conceptual idea which is purely nonexistent 
yat idam vastunaḥ rūpam eka anantaram īkṣyate | prāk āsīt na iti tat bījam prāk bhūte tu idam asti na || 	The basis (of the said conception) lies in the fact that the form of a thing perceived in immediate sequence to another thing did not exist before. if the said thing had existed previously, then this basis would not be there (for the said assumption) 
kṣīra ādiṣu ca dadhi ādi śakti rūpeṇa yat matam | kā śaktiḥ tatra dadhi ādi yadi dṛśyeta dugdha vat || 	It has been held that the curd and other effects subsist in the milk and other causes, in the form of latent potency; now what is this ‘potency’? if it is the same as the curd and other effects,—then this also would be perceived like the milk itself 
anyat ced katham anyasya bhāve abhaktyā anyat ucyate | nahi satvasya sadbhāvaḥ sadbhāvaḥ duḥkha mohayoḥ || 	If it is something different (from the effect), then the existence of one thing cannot be spoken of as that of another, except figuratively. (for example) the existence of the (attribute of) ‘harmony’ is not spoken of as the existence of ‘pain’ and ‘delusion 
sattva ādi anugatam vyaktam na siddham naḥ kathaṃcana | āntara tvāt sukha ādīnām vyakta tvāt tad sva saṃvidaḥ || 	The ‘manifest’ is not admitted by us in any way whatsoever as homogeneous with (made up of) pleasure and the rest; because pleasure and the rest are ‘internal’, ‘subjective’; and that these are so is manifest from their own clear cognition 
ekatra eva ca śabda ādau bhāvanā jāti bhedataḥ | saṅga ādayaḥ saṃbhavinaḥ lakṣyante niyatāḥ sphuṭam || 	On account of the diversity of habit and nature, all possible attachment and the rest are clearly found to be restricted to each single object, like sound and the rest 
eka vastu anupāti tve citrā saṃvid prasajyate | adṛṣṭa ādi vaśāt no ced na syāt vastu anuyāyinī || 	Being in keeping with one and the same object, the consciousness would be variegated in character.—if it be urged that “it is not so because of destiny and such other forces”,—then the consciousness would not be in keeping with the object at all 
tri ākāram vastunaḥ rūpam eka ākārāḥ ca tad vidaḥ | tāḥ katham tatra yujyante bhāvinyaḥ tad vilakṣaṇāḥ || 	The form of the object itself is three-formed, and the cognitions (of men) are one-formed;—how can these latter be really possible with reference to the object,—being entirely different from it in character? 
prasāda udvega varaṇāni ekasmin puṃsi yoginām | jāyante na ca tad rūpaḥ pumān abhimataḥ paraiḥ || 	For the followers of yoga, ‘satisfaction’, ‘dissatisfaction’ and ‘delusion’ are produced in the same spirit; and yet the other party do not hold the spirit to be of the essence of those 
siddhe api triguṇe vyakte na pradhānam prasidhyati | ekam tad kāraṇam nityam na eka jāti anvitam hi tat || 	Even though the ‘manifest’ be accepted as ‘consisting of three attributes’,—primordial matter does not become established as the one eternal cause of that (manifest); because that ‘manifest’ is not imbued with any single generic character 
ayaḥ śalākā kalpāḥ hi krama saṅgata mūrtayaḥ | dṛśyante vyaktayaḥ sarvāḥ kalpanā miśrita ātmikāḥ || 	All ‘manifested things’ are found to be like iron-bars; as having their forms associated with an order of sequence and their essence mixed up with fancies 
mṛd vikāra ādayaḥ bhedāḥ na eka jāti anvitāḥ tathā  | siddhāḥ na eka nimittāḥ ca mṛd piṇḍa ādeḥ vibhedataḥ || 	So also the various products of clay and other things are not recognised as imbued with any single generic character,—nor as the effects of any single cause; as all such things as the ‘lump of clay’ are diverse 
caitanya ādi anvita tve api na eka pūrva tvam iṣyate | puruṣāṇām amukhyam ced tat iha api samam na kim || 	In the case of ‘spirits’, even though they are endowed with ‘sentience’ and other qualities, they are not regarded (by the sāṃkhya) as preceded (produced) by a single entity (as their cause).—it might be said that “the said qualities are attributed (to the spirits) only secondarily (indirectly, figuratively)”;—then why cannot the same be the case in regard to the matter under discussion also? 
pradhāna hetu abhāve api tatas sarvam prakalpate | śakteḥ bhedena vaicitryam kārya kāraṇa tā ādikam || 	Thus, even in the absence of a cause in the shape of ‘primordial matter’, all diversity relating to effects and causes and other things becomes explicable, on the basis of the diversity of potencies 
pradhāna hetu abhāve api tatas sarvam prakalpate | śakteḥ bhedena vaicitryam kārya kāraṇa tā ādikam || 	Thus, even in the absence of a cause in the shape of ‘primordial matter’, all diversity relating to effects and causes and other things becomes explicable, on the basis of the diversity of potencies 
sarva utpattimatām īśam anye hetum pracakṣate | na acetanam sva kāryāṇi kila prārabhate svayam || 	Other philosophers declare the ‘lord’ to be the cause of all things produced; on the ground that no insentient thing, by itself, can produce its effects 
sarva utpattimatām īśam anye hetum pracakṣate | na acetanam sva kāryāṇi kila prārabhate svayam || 	Other philosophers declare the ‘lord’ to be the cause of all things produced; on the ground that no insentient thing, by itself, can produce its effects 
yat sva ārambhaka avayava saṃniveśa viśeṣa vat | buddhimat hetu gamyam tat tat yathā kalaśa ādikam || dvi indriya grāhyam agrāhyam vivāda padam īdṛśam  | buddhimat pūrvakam tena vaidharmyaiṇa aṇavaḥ matāḥ || 	A) that which is characterised by a peculiar arrangement of its own component parts is subject to a cause that is endowed with intelligence,—for instance, the jar and other objects.—the thing in dispute,—which is perceptible by means of two sense-organs and also imperceptible,—must be preceded (and produced) by a cause endowed with intelligence,—atoms supplying the corroborative instance ‘per dissimilarity’.” 
tattva ādīnām upādānam cetanāvat adhiṣṭhitam | rūpa ādimat tvāt tantu ādi yathā dṛṣṭam sva kārya kṛt || 	B) the material cause of the body and other things is controlled by an intelligent being,—because they are endowed with colour and other qualities,—like the yarn and such things which have been seen to bring about their effects (only when controlled by the intelligent weaver).” 
dharma adharma aṇavaḥ sarve cetanāvat adhiṣṭhitāḥ  | sva kārya ārambhakāḥ sthitvā pravṛtteḥ turi tantu vat || 	In the producing of their effects, all such causes as merit, demerit and atoms are controlled by an intelligent being,—because they operate intermittently,—like the shuttle and the yarn.” 
sarga ādau vyavahāraḥ ca puṃsām anya upadeśa jaḥ | niyata tvāt prabuddhānām kumāra vyavahāra vat || 	At the beginning of creation, usage among men must have been due to the teaching of other persons;—when they become subsequently awakened to consciousness, it is found to be restricted to particular things,—like the usage of little boys.” 
mahābhūta ādikam vyaktam buddhimat hetu adhiṣṭhitam | yāti sarvasya lokasya sukha duḥsva nimitta tām || acetana tva kārya tva vināśi tva ādi hetutaḥ | vāsi ādi vat atas spaṣṭam tasya sarvam pratīyate || 	The manifested world, consisting of the primary elemental substances and the rest, becomes the source of pleasure and pain to all people, only when controlled by an intelligent cause,—because it is insentient, itself a product, evanescent and so forth,—like the axe and other things; thus everything is clearly believed to be his.” 
sarva kartṛ tva siddhau ca sarvajña tvam ayatnataḥ | siddham asya yatas kartā kārya rūpa ādi vedakaḥ || 	The fact of his being the creator of all things having been established, his omniscience is proved without effort; because the creator must be one who knows the form and all other details regarding what he has created.” 
vimateḥ āspadam vastu pratyakṣam kasya cit sphuṭam | vastu sattva ādi hetubhyaḥ sukha duḥkha ādi bhedavat || 	The thing under dispute must clearly be perceptible to some one,—because or such reasons as being a thing, being existent and so forth:—just like the diversities of pleasure, pain, etc.—[and this some one is god].” 
tat atra asiddha tā hetoḥ prathame sādhane yatas  | sanniveśaḥ na yoga ākhyaḥ siddhaḥ na avayavī tathā  || 	The first argument (propounded by the naiyāyika) is open to the fallacy of being ‘unproven, inadmissible’; because the existence of any such ‘arrangement’ as ‘conjunction’ is not proven, nor that of the ‘composite 
dṛśya tvena abhyupetasya dvayasya anupalambhanāt | sādhana ananvitam ca idam udāharaṇam api atas || 	Because both the facts that have been assumed (and put forward) are such as are not actually apprehended; and for the same reason the corroborative instance also that has been cited has no connection with the probans cited 
cakṣuḥ sparśana vijñānam bhinna ābham upajāyate | eka ālambana tā na asti tayoḥ gandha ādi vitti vat || 	Visual cognition and tactile cognition always appear differently; they cannot therefore have one and the same substratum,—just like the cognition of odour and other things 
tad sāmarthya samudbhūta kalpanā anugata ātmakam | pratisandhāna vijñānam samudāyam vyavasyati || jala anala ādi na eva idam dvi indriya grāhyam asti atas  | āśraya asiddha tā asiddheḥ yathā abhihita dharmiṇaḥ || 	As a matter of fact, what brings about the joint cognition (involved in recognition) is the fact that recognition consists in an assumption arising out of the potencies of the two cognitions concerned.—thus, such things as water, fire and the like are not ‘perceptible by two sense-organs ’; and hence the probans (of the naiyāyika) is found to have its substratum ‘unproven, inadmissible’, as is indicated by the ‘ un-proven ’ character of the object itself 
sanniveśa viśiṣṭa tvam yādṛś devakula ādiṣu | karttari anupalabdhe api yad dṛṣṭau buddhimat gatiḥ || tādṛś eva yat īkṣyeta tanvak ādiṣu dharmiṣu | yuktam tad sādhanāt asmāt yathā abhīṣṭasya sādhanam || 	In the case of temples and such things, the presence of a peculiar arrangement (of component parts) is distinctly perceived,—from which perception follows the cognition (inferential) of an intelligent builder,—even when no such builder is actually seen; if, in the case of such objects as the body, the mountain and the like, a similar peculiar arrangement of parts were distinctly perceived, then it would be correct to deduce from this perception as the reason, the conclusion that is desired (by the Naiyāyika) 
anvaya vyatirekābhyām yat kāryam yasya niścitam  | niścayaḥ tasya tad dṛṣṭau iti nyāyaḥ vyavasthitaḥ  || saṃniveśa viśeṣaḥ tu na eva amīṣu tathāvidhaḥ | tanu taru ādi bhedeṣu śabdaḥ eva tu kevalaḥ || tādṛśaḥ procyamānaḥ tu sandigdha vyatireka tām | āsādayati valmīke kumbhakāra kṛta ādiṣu || 	When a certain thing is definitely recognised, through affirmative and negative concomitance, as the effect of a certain cause, then, the perception of that effect must prove that cause;—such is the standing law.—the ‘peculiar arrangement of parts’ in such diverse things as the body, the mountain and the like however is not an effect of this kind; there is a mere assertion to that effect.—such a reason, when put forward, renders the conclusion open to doubt and denial, as it does when put forward for proving that ‘the anthill is the work of the potter 
nanu jāti uttaram idam dharma bheda vikalpanāt | sāmānyam eva kārya ādi sādhanam pratipāditam || 	What has been put forward (by you) is only a ‘futile rejoinder’, as it is based upon the assumption op a particular character; while what has been put forward (by us, the naiyāyika) is only the general character of ‘effects’.” 
a tad rūpa parāvṛttam vastu mātram anitya tām | tādātmyat sādhayati eṣa na nyāyaḥ asti iha sādhane || 	In the example of futile rejoinder cited] the mere thing (effect in general), as excluded from all that is not that thing (not-effect), does really prove non-eternality, on account of its being of the same essence as that. but as regards the probans under discussion, there is no reason for it at all 
dhūma ātmā dhavalaḥ dṛṣṭaḥ pāvaka avyabhicāravān | sita abhidheya tā mātrāt na himāt api tad gatiḥ || 	As a matter of fact, the smoke that has been seen to be invariably concomitant with fire is white; and yet the mention of mere ‘whiteness’ could not prove the existence of fire; if it did, then that existence could be inferred even from the ‘snow’ 
sāmānya pratibandhe tu viśeṣa āśrayaṇī yadā | codanā kriyate tatra jāti uttaram udāhṛtam || 	When the invariable concomitance (premiss) is stated in the general form, and the objection urged against it is on the basis of a particular aspect of it,—then this is said to be a futile rejoinder 
go śabda vācya tā mātrāt diś ādīnām viṣāṇi tā  | saṃsiddhyet anyathā hi eṣa nyāyaḥ na āśrīyate yadi || 	The mere character of ‘being denoted by the term go’ (as a general character) might prove the ‘presence of horns’ in the quarters and other things (which are all denoted by the term ‘go’),—ip the reasoning were not adopted in a different form 
yadi tu pratibandhaḥ asmin pramāṇe na upapadyate | tat atra yuktitaḥ siddhe na vivādaḥ asti kasyacid || 	If it were proved by some valid means of cognition that there is an invariable concomitance between the probans and the probandum (cited by the naiyāyika), then, the conclusion would be fully established by reasoning, and no one could have anything to say against it 
kintu nitya eka sarvajña nitya buddhi samāśrayaḥ | sādhya vaikalyataḥ avyāpteḥ na siddhim upagacchati || 	But the existence of a being who is eternal, one, and the substratum of eternal all-embracing consciousness,—can never be proved; as the invariable concomitance (premiss) that may be cited would be devoid of the probandum 
tathā hi saudha sopāna gopura aṭṭālaka ādayaḥ | aneka anitya vijñāna pūrvaka tvena niścitāḥ || 	For instance, all such products as houses, steps, gateways, towers and the like are definitely known to have been made by makers who have been many, and with fleeting ideas 
atas eva ayam iṣṭasya vighāta kṛt api icya ṣya te | aneka anitya vijñāna pūrvaka tva prasādhanāt || 	For the same reason, the probans is also detrimental to what is desired; inasmuch as what it establishes is [a cause] that is many, and the substratum of fleeting ideas 
buddhimat hetu mātre hi pratibandhaḥ tvayā uditaḥ | dvitīye punar asmābhiḥ vispaṣṭam abhidhīyate || 	The invariable concomitance that has been asserted by you is only with reference to the probandum in the form of ‘the character of having an intelligent cause’; and we are going to assert it clearly with reference to a second (different, contrary) probandum 
krama akrama virodhena nityāḥ no kārya kāriṇaḥ | viṣayāṇām krami tvena tad jñāneṣu api ca kramaḥ || 	For us, eternal things cannot produce any effects, because ‘consecutive’ and ‘concurrent’ action are mutually contradictory; and if objects are consecutive, there must be the same consecutiveness in their cognitions also 
krama bhāvi īśvara jñānam krami vijñeya saṅgateḥ | devadatta ādi vijñānam yathā jvālā ādi gocaram || 	God’s cognition must be consecutive, because it is related to consecutive cognisable things;—just like the cognition of devadatta and other persons, relating to flame and other things 
aṇu saṃhati mātram ca ghaṭāt yasmābhiḥ iṣyate | tad kārakaḥ kulāla ādiḥ aṇūnām eva kārakaḥ || na vyāvṛttaḥ tatas dharmaḥ sādhya tvena abhivāñchitaḥ | aṇu udāharaṇāt asmāt vaidharmyeṇa prakāśitāt || 	The jar and other things are regarded by us as mere aggregates of atoms; and the potter and other men who make those things are only makers of the atoms; hence the character that you mean to prove (i.e. your probandum) is not excluded (absent) erom the atom which has been cited (by you) as a corroborative instance per dissimilarity 
buddhimat pūrvaka tvam ca sāmānyena yadi iṣyate | tatra na eva vivādaḥ naḥ vaiśvarūpyam hi karma jam || 	If the character of ‘being produced by an intelligent cause’ is meant to be proved only in a general form, then we have no dispute with you; as all diversity is due to actions 
nitya eka buddhi pūrva tva sādhane sādhya śūnya tā | vyabhicāraḥ ca saudha ādeḥ bahubhiḥ karaṇa īkṣaṇāt || 	If what you seek to prove is the fact that the world is created by a cause who is one and whose consciousness is eternal,—then there is absence of the probandum (in the instance); and it is ‘inconclusive’ also, since such things as the house and the like are found to be made by several makers 
etat eva yathāyogyam avaśiṣṭeṣu hetuṣu | yojyam dūṣaṇam anyat ca kiñcid mātram prakāśyate || 	Against the other reasonings (of the theist) also, this same criticism may be urged mutatis mutandis; some other criticism also is now being briefly set forth 
sthitvā pravṛttiḥ aṇu ādeḥ na siddhā kṣaṇa bhaṅgataḥ | vyabhicāraḥ ca tena eva tasya api krama vṛtti tā || 	Intermittent action’ of atoms and other causes is not proven (admitted); as there is ‘perpetual flux’, all things are undergoing destruction every moment; it is also ‘inconclusive’ in reference to that same (god), as hls activity also is consecutive (hence intermittent) 
pralaye lupta vijñāna smṛtayaḥ puruṣāḥ na naḥ | ābhāsvara ādi sambhūteḥ tatas eva iha saṃbhavāt || 	According to us, at dissolution, persons do not continue to remain with all consciousness and memory completely lost; because they are born in effulgent regions, and from these latter they are born again in this world 
vimukhasya upadeṣṭṛ tvam śraddhā gamyam param yadi | vaimukhyam vitanu tvena dharma adharma vivekataḥ || 	Then again, the ‘teachership’ of a mouthless person can only be a matter of blind faith; god’s ‘mouthlessness’ is proved by his having no body, on account of the absence in him of merit and demerit 
anumāna virodhaḥ ca vyāpteḥ sarvatra sādhane | na viruddhena dharmeṇa vyāptiḥ hetoḥ prakalpate || 	In all the arguments, the invariable concomitance (premiss) is contrary to inference; and there can be no invariable concomitance of the probans on the basis of a contrary (false) character 
na īśvaraḥ janminām hetuḥ utpatti vikala tvataḥ  | gagana ambhoja vat sarvam anyathā yugapad bhavet || 	God cannot be the cause of born things,—because he is hlmsele devoid of birth,—like the ‘sky-lotus’, otherwise, all things would come into existence simultaneously 
ye vā krameṇa jāyante te na eva īśvara hetukāḥ  | yathā ukta sādhana udbhūtāḥ jaḍānām pratyayāḥ iva || teṣām api tad udbhūtau viphalā sādhana abhidhā | nitya tvāt acikitsyasya nā eva sā sahakāriṇī || 	Things that are born consecutively cannot have cod for their cause,—just like the notions of foolish persons arising from the said reasonings (of the theist).—if those (notions) also are produced by cod, then the adducing of proofs (in support of them) should be useless; because of (his) eternality; and as he would be beyond remedy, the said statement could render no help 
yeṣu satsu bhavat dṛṣṭam asatsu na kadāca | tasya anya hetu tā klṛptau anavasthā katham na te || 	When you have seen that a certain thing exists only when certain other things exist, and never when these do not exist,—then, if you assume a cause for the former, other than these latter,—how can you avoid falling into an infinite regress? 
kartṛ tva pratiṣedhāt ca sarvajña tvam nirākṛtam | boddhavyam tad balena eva sarvajña tva upapādanāt || 	By the refutation of god’s creatorship, his omniscience also is understood to be set aside by the same; as it is on the strength of ‘creatorship’ that the argument for ‘omniscience’ has been based 
yathā ukta doṣa duṣṭāni mā abhūvan sādhanāni vā | tathā api kartuḥ na eka tvam vyabhicāra upadarśanāt || eka kartuḥ asiddhau ca sarvajña tvam kim āśrayam | 	Your reasonings may not be beset with the defects urged above; and yet the creator cannot be one, because the falsity of such a proposition has been shown above; and when the oneness of the creator is not proved, wherein could ‘omniscience’ subsist?a) 
prakṛti īśvarayoḥ evam hetu tva pratiṣedhanāt | pratyekam sahitam kartṛ na ubhayam janminām idam || 	The doctrines of ‘god’ or ‘primordial matter’ severally being the cause (of the world) having been refuted,—it follows that these two together cannot be the ‘maher’ of things produced 
prakṛti īśvarayoḥ evam hetu tva pratiṣedhanāt | pratyekam sahitam kartṛ na ubhayam janminām idam || 	The doctrines of ‘god’ or ‘primordial matter’ severally being the cause (of the world) having been refuted,—it follows that these two together cannot be the ‘maher’ of things produced 
sāhityam sahakāri tvāt etayoḥ kalpyate ca yat | tat syāt atiśaya ādhānāt eka artha kriyayā api vā || na yuktā kalpanā ādyasya nirvikāra tayā tayoḥ | na dvitīyasya kāryāṇām yaugapadya prasaṅgataḥ || 	As for their ‘association’ assumed on the basis op their acting jointly,—this could be due either (a) to the creation op some peculiarity, or (b) to their serving a common purpose. (a) The former op these assumptions cannot be right, as both are ‘unmodifiable’; (b) nor is the latter acceptable; as that would lead to the absurdity op all products coming into existence simultaneously

iha ucyate tayoḥ eka kriyā kāle samasti kim | tad anya kārya niṣpatti sāmarthyam yadi vā na tat || yadi asti sarga kāle api dvayam api aparam bhavet | evam anyasya sadbhāve dvayam anyat prasajyate || 	The answer to this is as follows at the time that the two are performing one act (of creating or maintaining or dissolving),—is their capacity to perform the other acts present? or is it not present?—If it is present, then at the time of creation, the other two acts also should come about;—thus whenever any one of the acts would be there, the other two would have to be there! 
na hi tad para rūpeṇa punar anyasya kārakam | svarūpam ca tat eva asya tad kriyā viratiḥ kutas || 	As a matter of fact, the two (primordial matter and god) are the cause of the other two acts also, not in any other form than the one that brings about the one act; the form of the cause remains the same; why then should there be any cessation of the functioning of any act at all? 
tad sāmarthya viyoge tu na eva tad janakam bhavet | anyadā śakti śūnya tvāt viyat ambhoruha ādi vat || 	If there were disappearance of any particular potency, then the cause could never be productive of its particular effect;—because it is devoid of that potency at some other time; just like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such other things 
utkaṭam śakti rūpam ca yadi tanmātra kāraṇam | sarvadā tat bhavet hetoḥ nitya rūpasya sannidheḥ || 	If the manifested form of the potency had that same (primordial matter and god) for its cause, then, that would continue to be there at all times, because of the proximity of the cause, which is eternal 
na ca aparaṃparaiḥ iṣṭam atas na eva anyatas api tat | na api svatantram eva idam kādācitka tva saṃbhavāt || 	b) As regards the second alternative, that cannot be accepted by the other party; and for that very reason, it could not be the effect of some other cause 
svatas bhāve hi ahetu tvam sva kriyāyāḥ virodhataḥ | apekṣayā hi bhāvānām kādācitka tva saṃbhavaḥ || 	c) Nor can it be self-sufficient; as it appears only at certain times If it were self-produced, then it would be causeless; as any operation of a thing upon itself is a contradiction in terms.—if there were dependence (upon something else) then the effects would be such as would appear at only certain times 
tathā hi na hi abhāvasya sva ātmani vyāpṛtiḥ matā  | niṣpannasya ātmanaḥ api asyām avasthāyām prasiddhitaḥ || 	For instance, mere negation (absence) is not regarded as having any action upon itself;—as for the well-established positive entity, it is well known and recognised under the circumstances 
aniṣpanna ātma tatvaḥ tu na eva vyāpriyate kvacid | sarva śakti viyukta tvāt ākāśa kamala ādi vat || 	If its own ‘essence’ is still unestablished, it cannot be operated upon by anything;—because it is bereft of all potency,—like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things 
aniṣpanna ātma tatvaḥ tu na eva vyāpriyate kvacid | sarva śakti viyukta tvāt ākāśa kamala ādi vat || 	If its own ‘essence’ is still unestablished, it cannot be operated upon by anything;—because it is bereft of all potency,—like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things 
sarva hetu nirāśaṃsam bhāvānām janma varṇyate | svabhāva vādibhiḥ te hi na āhuḥ svam api kāraṇam || 	The propounders of the doctrine of the ‘thing- by itself’ describe the origination of things as being independent of all causes. they do not declare even the thing itself to be its own ‘cause 
sarva hetu nirāśaṃsam bhāvānām janma varṇyate | svabhāva vādibhiḥ te hi na āhuḥ svam api kāraṇam || 	The propounders of the doctrine of the ‘thing- by itself’ describe the origination of things as being independent of all causes. they do not declare even the thing itself to be its own ‘cause 
rājīva kesara ādīnām vaiciñyaṃkaḥ karoti hi | mayūra candraka ādiḥ vā vicitraḥ kena nirmitaḥ || 	Who makes the diversity in the lotus and its filaments, eto.? by whom too have the variegated wings of the peacock and such things been created?” 
yathā eva kaṇṭaka ādīnām taikṣṇya dikam ahetukam | kādācitka tayā tadvat duḥkha ādīnām ahetu tā || 	Just as the sharpness and other properties of the thorn and other things must be regarded as without cause, on the ground of their appearing at certain times only,—so also must pain and other (internal) things be regarded as without cause”

niyatau deśa kālau ca bhāvānām bhavataḥ katham | yadi tad hetu tā na eṣām syuḥ te sarvatra sarvadā || kvacid kadācid kasmiṃścid bhavantaḥ niyatāḥ punar  | tad sāpekṣāḥ bhavanti ete tad anya parihārataḥ || 	Particular points of place and time also are related (as cause) to things.—“how so?”—if the said points were not the cause of things, these would be produced everywhere and at all times 115) As a matter of fact however things are found to be produced specifically at a certain place, at a certain time and in certain receptacles,—being dependent upon these and independent of all others 
tad apekṣā tathāvṛttiḥ apekṣā kārya tā ucyate | pratyakṣā ca tathā vṛttiḥ siddhāḥ tena iha hetavaḥ || 	What is meant by their being ‘dependent’ is that they come into existence in that manner; so that it is the character of ‘effect’ that is spoken of as ‘dependence that things come into existence in that manner is a perceptible fact; hence the said causes become duly established 
tad svābhāvika vādaḥ ayam pratyakṣeṇa prabādhyate | pratyakṣa anupalambhābhyām hetu rūpasya niścayāt || 	Thus the doctrine of the ‘thing by itself’ is discarded by perception; specially as the exact nature of the ‘cause5 of things is duly ascertained through perception and non-apprehension 
mā vā pramāṇa sattā bhūt hetu sadbhāva siddhaye | tathā api māna abhāvena na eva artha asatva niścayaḥ || 	It may be that there are no proofs for the existence of the ‘cause’ of things; but the mere absence of proof (means of cognising) cannot prove the non-existence of any thing 
yasmāt arthasya sattāyāḥ vyāpakam na ca kāraṇam | pramāṇam bheda sadbhāvāt vyabhicārāt tad udbhavāt || 	Inasmuch as ‘proof’ (means of cognition) is not pervasive of the ‘existence of the thing’; nor is it its ‘cause’,a) because there is difference, (b) because there is non-concomitance, and (c) because it proceeds from that,—[mere absence of proof cannot prove the non-existence of a thing] 
yaḥ ca na evaṃvidhaḥ bhāvaḥ tasya na eva nivṛttitaḥ | ekāntikam asaṃbandhāt gamyate anya nivartanam || 	When a thing is neither the one nor the other, its absence does not conclusively preclude the other thing; because there is no connection 
sarva adṛṣṭiḥ ca sandigdhā sva adṛṣṭiḥ vyabhicāriṇī | vindhya adri randhra dūrvā ādeḥ adṛṣṭau api satvataḥ || 	Non-perception’ by all persons is doubtful; ‘non-perception’ by any one person himself is inconclusive; as it is found that the grass and other things growing in the caves of the vindhya mountain do exist, even though they are not perceived 
ahetuka tva siddhi artham na ced hetuḥ prayujyate | na ca apramāṇikī siddhiḥ atas pakṣaḥ na siddhyati || tad siddhaye ca hetuḥ ced prayujyeta tathā api na | siddheḥ tad hetu janya tvāt pakṣaḥ te saṃprasiddhyati || 	If no reason is adduced to prove the fact of things having no cause, then, inasmuch nothing can be proved without reason, your theory is not proved.—if, on the other hand, you do adduce a reason proving it,—then also your theory is not proved,—as the proving itself would be produced by the proof adduced [which would therefore be the cause of the proving] 
tathā hi jñāpakaḥ hetuḥ vacaḥ vā tad prakāśakam | siddheḥ nimitta tām gacchan sādhya jñāpakam ucyate || 	As regards the indicative,—be it in the form of the probans, or in the form of words expressive of that (probans),—it is said to be ‘indicative’ of the probandum (desired conclusion), only when it becomes the ‘cause’ of the proving (making known) [of the said conclusion] 
atas kārakaḥ eva ayam jñāpakaḥ hetuḥ ucyate | sādhya anutpādaka tvāt tu kārakaḥ na prakāśyate || 	Thus it is really the ‘productive’ cause which is spoken of as ‘indicative’; it is because it does not actually produce (bring into existence) what is desired to be accomplished that it is not called ‘productive’ 
tasmāt sa hetavaḥ anye api bhāvāḥ niyata janmataḥ | sādhya artha viṣayam yadvat jñānam sādhana bhāvi te || 	From all this it follows that other things also have their ‘causes’,—as their production is restricted,—just like your cognition of the probandum appearing when the probans is there 
tasmāt sa hetavaḥ anye api bhāvāḥ niyata janmataḥ | sādhya artha viṣayam yadvat jñānam sādhana bhāvi te || 	From all this it follows that other things also have their ‘causes’,—as their production is restricted,—just like your cognition of the probandum appearing when the probans is there 
nāśa utpāda asamālīḍham brahma śabda mayam param | yat tasya pariṇāmaḥ ayam bhāva grāmaḥ pratīyate || 	The whole lot of things is recognised as evolved out of that brahman which is of the essence of word-sound, the highest,—unaffected by destruction and origination.” 
nāśa utpāda asamālīḍham brahma śabda mayam param | yat tasya pariṇāmaḥ ayam bhāva grāmaḥ pratīyate || 	The whole lot of things is recognised as evolved out of that brahman which is of the essence of word-sound, the highest,—unaffected by destruction and origination.”

yena śabda mayam sarvam mukhya vṛttyā vyavasthitam | śabda rūpa a parityāge pariṇāma abhidhānataḥ || 	It would be as asserted above] because all things (according to you) exist primarily in the eorm of sound; and if the sound-form is not abandoned, there can be no modification (evolution) 
agauṇe ca evam eka tve nīla ādīnām vyavasthite | tad saṃvedana velāyām katham na asti asya vedanam || 	The identity (of sound) with blue and other things being not figurative (but real),—why should not there be cognition of sound at the time that the blue and other things are cognised? 
asya avittau hi nīla ādeḥ api na syāt pravedanam | ekātmyāt bhinna dharma tve bhedaḥ atyantam prasajyate || 	If there were no cognition of it (sound), then there should be none of the blue and other things also; because both are of the same essence. in case they had different properties, there would be absolute difference between them 
viruddha dharma saṅgaḥ hi bahūnām bheda lakṣaṇam | na anyathā vyakti bhedānām kalpitaḥ api bhavet asau || 	What indicates difference among a number of things is the presence of incompatible properties; otherwise, no difference could even be assumed among diverse individuals 
pratibhāvam ca yadi ekaḥ śabda ātmā bhinnaḥ iṣyate | sarveṣām eka deśa tvam eka ākārā ca vid bhavet || 	If the one ‘sound-essence’ be held to be different with each individual thing, then all things would occupy the same point in space and would be cognised in one and the same form 
prativyakti tu bhede asya brahma anekam prasajyate | vibhinna aneka bhāva ātma rūpa tvāt vyakti bheda vat || 	If (on the other hand) it differs with each individual (thing), then brahman becomes many,—as having a form which is diverse and of the nature of several things,—just like the diversity of individuals 
nitya śabda maya tve ca bhāvānām api nitya tā | tad yaugapadyataḥ siddheḥ pariṇāmaḥ na saṅgataḥ || 	If things consisted of eternal ‘sound’, they also would be eternal; and hence as things would be accomplished simultaneously with the sound, no ‘modification’ would be compatible 
eka rūpa tirobhāve hi anya rūpa samudbhave | mṛd ādau iva saṃsidhyet pariṇāmaḥ tu na ākrame || 	There could be ‘modification’ only if there were disappearance of one form followed by the appearance of another form,—as is found to be the case with ölay and other things;—it could not be possible however if all appeared without sequence (simultaneously) 
atha api kārya rūpeṇa śabdabrahma mayam jagat | tathā api nirvikāra tvāt tatas na eva krama udayaḥ || 	If the world be regarded as ‘consisting of sound’ in the form of ‘product’ (not eternal),—even so, as sound would be unmodifiable, there could be no sequential appearance 
anya anya rūpa saṃbhūtau tasmāt eka svarūpataḥ | vivṛttam artha rūpeṇa katham nāma tat ucyate || 	If, from sound which is of one form always, diverse forms are produced, then how is it that the world is spoken of as ‘evolved’ in the form of the object? 
a tad rūpa parāvṛtta mṛd rūpa tva upalabdhitaḥ  | kumbha kośa ādi bhedeṣu mṛd ātmā ekaḥ atra kalpate || nīla pīta ādi bhāvānām na tu evam upalabhyate | a śabda ātma parāvṛttiḥ abījā kalpanā api tat || 	In the case of such diverse things as the jar, the pail and the like, it is found that all of them are of the nature of clay, which differentiates them from all that is not-clay; and on the basis of this it is assumed that in all these there subsists the one ‘clay-nature’—no such nature however is perceived in the case of such things as the blue, the yellow and so forth; hence the assumption of any such one nature as is preclusive of all that is not-sound would be absolutely baseless.— 
atha avibhāgam eva idam brahma tattvam sadā sthitam | avidyā upaplavāt lokaḥ vicitram tu abhimanyace || 	If it be held that—“Brahman in its essence remains ever undifferentiated; it is only under disturbance due to ignorance that people regard it as diverse” 
tatra api vedyate rūpam avidyā upaplutaiḥ janaiḥ | yat nīla ādi prakāreṇa tyāga ādāne nibandhanam || tad rūpa vyatirekeṇa brahma rūpam alakṣitam | katham vyutthita cetobhiḥ astitvena pratīyate || 	Even so, what is actually perceived in the form of blue and the; rest by persons tramelled by nescience which form serves as the basis of rejecting and acquiring certain things,—apart from that form, what is there in the form of ‘Brahman’, unperceived, which could be cognised as ‘existing by persons whose mind has risen above (the shackles of nescience)? 
na tat pratyakṣataḥ siddham avibhāgam abhāsanāt | nityāt utpatti ayogena kārya liṅgam ca tatra na || dharmi sattva aprasiddheḥ tu na svabhāvaḥ prasādhakaḥ | na ca etat atirekeṇa liṅgam sattā prasādhakam || 	The undifferentiated Brahman cannot be proved by perception, because it never appears in that form;—and as nothing can be produced from what is eternal, there can be no probans in the form of an effect (which could lead to the inference of Brahman); and as the very existence of the thing itself (Brahman) is still unproved, no character of its own could serve as the probans leading to the inference (of the said Brahman); and apart from these two, there can be no probans which could prove the existence (of Brahman) 
jñānam jñeya kramāt siddham kramavat sarvam anyathā  | yaugapadyena tat kāryam vijñānam anuṣajyate || jñāna mātre api nā eva asya śakrakya rūpam tatas param | bhavati iti prasaktā asya vandhyā sūnu samāna tā || 	All consciousness must be consecutive, as it must follow the order of sequence of the objects cognised; if it were not so, its effect in the form of cognition would come about simultaneously.—hence even in the effect in the form of ‘cognition’, there is nothing, apart from the rejecting and acquiring, which could be within the powers of brahman; so that it becomes reduced to the position of the ‘son of the barren woman’ 
viśuddha jñāna santānāḥ yoginaḥ api tatas na tat | vidanti brahmaṇaḥ rūpam jñāne vyāpṛtya saṅgateḥ || 	For the same reason even mystics with their ‘chain of pure consciousness’ do not know that form of brahman; as the necessary connection could be possible only after an action of the cognition itself 
pradhāna pariṇāmena samam ca brahma darśanam | tad dūṣaṇa anusāreṇa boddhavyam iha dūṣaṇam || 	This doctrine of ‘Brahman’ also is similar to the doctrine of the ‘evolution from primordial matter’; and the objections urged against this latter should be understood to be applicable to the former also 
pradhāna pariṇāmena samam ca brahma darśanam | tad dūṣaṇa anusāreṇa boddhavyam iha dūṣaṇam || 	This doctrine of ‘Brahman’ also is similar to the doctrine of the ‘evolution from primordial matter’; and the objections urged against this latter should be understood to be applicable to the former also

anye tu īśa sadharmāṇam puruṣam loka kāraṇam | kalpayanti durākhyāta siddhānta anuga buddhayaḥ || samasta vastu pralaye api alupta jñāna śaktimān | ūrṇanābhaḥ iva aṃśūnām sa hetuḥ kila janminām || 	Others, however, postulate the ‘puruṣa’ (spirit),—similar in character to ‘god’—as the cause of the world,—their mind being swayed by an ill-conceived doctrine. thus ‘spirit’ has his powers such as do not cease even in regard to the dissolution of all things; he is the cause of all born things, just as the spider is of the cobwebs 
asya api īśvara vat sarvam vacanīyam niṣedhanam | kimartham ca karoti eṣa vyāpāram imam īdṛśam || 	The reputation of this also is to be set forth, in the same manner as that of ‘god’: for what purpose does this ‘spirit’ perform such an act (as the creating, etc. of the world)? 
yadi anyena prayukta tvāt na syāt asya svatanna tā  | atha anukampayā kuryāt ekānta sukhitam jagat || ādhi dāridya śoka ādi vividha āyāsa pīḍitam | janam tu sṛjataḥ tasya kā anukampā pratīyate || 	If he does it because he is prompted by another being, then he can not be self-sufficient (independent).—if he does it through compassion, then he should make the world absolutely happy. when he is found to have created people beset with misery, poverty, sorrow and other troubles,—where can his compassion be perceived? 
sṛṣṭeḥ prāk anukampyānām asattve na upapadyate | anukampā api yad yogāt dhātā ayam parikalpyate || 	Further, inasmuch as, prior to creation, the objects of compassion would not be there,—there could not be even that compassion through the presence op which the ordainer is assumed 
na ca ayam pralayam kuryāt sadā abhyudaya yoginām | tad adṛṣṭa vyapekṣāyām svātantryam avahīyate || 	Nor should he ever bring about the dissolution op those beings who would be always prosperous. if in so doing, he be regarded as dependent upon the ‘unseen force’ (op destiny), then his ‘self-sufficiency’ ceases 
pīḍā hetum adṛṣṭam ca kimartham sa vyapekṣate | upekṣā eva punar tatra dayā yoge asya yujyate || 	Then again, why should he make himself dependent upon that destiny, which is conducive to suffering and pain? in fact, pull of mercy as he is, the right course for him would be to ignore that destiny 
krīḍā arthā tasya vṛttiḥ ced krīḍāyām na prabhuḥ bhavet | vicitra krīḍana upāya vyapekṣātaḥ śiśuḥ yathā || 	If the functioning of the spirit be said to be for purposes of ‘amusement’, then he would not be his own master regarding that amusement, as he would be dependent upon the various implements of that amusement,—just like a child 
krīḍā sādhyā ca yā prītiḥ tasyāḥ yat api sādhanam | tat sarvam yugapad kuryāt yadi tad kṛti śaktimān || krameṇa api na śaktaḥ syāt no ced ādau sa śaktimān | na avibhaktasya yujyete śakti aśaktī hi vastunaḥ || 	If he had the power to create them, he would have created, at one and the same time, all the implements conducive to the pleasure to be accomplished by the ‘amusement’.—if he did not have that power in the beginning, then he could not have it for creating them consecutively either. because for an indivisible thing, it is not possible to have power and also to be without power 
atha svabhāvataḥ vṛttiḥ sarga ādau asya varṇyate | pāvaka ādeḥ prakṛtyā eva yathā dāha ādi karmaṇi || yadi evam akhilāḥ bhāvāḥ bhaveyuḥ yugapad tatas  | tad utpādana sāmarthya yogi kāraṇa sannidheḥ || 	If it be held that “the functioning at the beginning of creation is due to his nature,—just like the functioning of fire and such things towards burning and such effects, which is due to their very nature”;—then, under the circumstances, all things should come into existence simultaneously; because of the presence of the cause fully competent to produce them 
sva hetu bala saṃbhūtāḥ niyatāḥ eva śaktayaḥ | asarva kāla bhāvinyaḥ jvalana ādiṣu vastuṣu || anyathā yaugapadyena sarvam kāryam samudbhavet | teṣām api na ced eṣa niyamaḥ abhyupagamyate || 	In the case of such things as fire and the like, their powers are dependent upon the efficiency of their own causes, and hence restricted in their operations, and consequently not effective at all times. if it were not so, all effects would come into existence simultaneously,—if in their case also there were no such restriction 
prakṛtyā eva aṃśu hetu tvam ūrṇanābhe api na iṣyate | prāṇi bhakṣaṇa lāmpaṭyāt lālā jālam karoti yat || 	In the case of the spider also, the causal capacity to produce the cobwebs is not admitted (by us) to be due to its very nature; what produces them is the saliva emitted by the spider’s eager desire to devour insects 
yathā kathaṃcid vṛttiḥ ced buddhimat tā asya kīdṛśī | na a samīkṣya yatas kāryam śanakaḥ api pravarttate || 	If the functioning (of the spirit) be ‘somehow’ (unintentional),—then what sort of ‘intelligence’ is his?—since even the fisherman does not act without thinking over the effect of his action

prāṇa ādibhiḥ viyuktaḥ ca jīvat dehaḥ bhavet ayam | nairātmyāt haṭa vat tasmāt na eva asti asya nirātma tā || 	This living body would be devoid of breathing and other functions,—because it would be soul-less,—like the jar. hence it cannot be soul-less.”

evam ca sattva nitya tva vibhu tvānām viniścaye | ātmanaḥ na nirātmānaḥ sarva dharmāḥ iti sthitam || 	Thus the existence, eternality and omnipresence of the soul being definitely proved,—it becomes established that nothing is soul-less.” 
tat atra prathame tāvat sādhane siddha sādhya tā | sarvajña ādi pravedya tvam tvad jñānasya iṣyate yatas || 	As regards the first argument that has been put forward, it is open to the charge of ‘proving what is already admitted’ (futile); as the apprehensibility of your cognition by the omniscient person and others is already admitted (by us) 
prakāśaka anapekṣam ca sva cit rūpam prajāyate | anya vijñānam api evam sādhya śūnyam nidarśanam || 	Whenever consciousness appears, it appears in its own form, independently of any other ‘illuminator’; so also the ‘cognition of other persons’;—hence your instance is devoid of the probandum 
tad ākāra uparaktena yat anyena pravedyate | tasya udāharaṇa tve api bhavet anyena saṃśayaḥ || 	Even if the instance meant be that cognition which is cognised as tinged by the form of the thing concerned,—it would be doubtful in regard to another cognition

āśrayaḥ badara ādīnām kuṇḍa ādiḥ upapadyate | gatyāḥ vibandha karaṇāt viśeṣa utpādanena vā || 	The pit and other things can be the ‘receptacle’ of the jujube fruit and other things, because they serve to obstruct their movement, or because they bring about specific changes 
nīrūpasya ca nāśasya kārya tvam na eva yuktimat | atas viśeṣaṇam vyartham hetau uktam paraiḥ iha || 	It is not reasonable to regard ‘destruction’, which is formless, as a ‘product’; hence the qualification mentioned in the reasoning of the other party is entirely useless 
mayā iti pratisandhānam avidyā upaplavāt idam | kṣaṇikeṣu api sarveṣu kartṛ eka tva ādi bhāsataḥ || mithyā vikalpataḥ ca asmāt na yuktā tattva saṃsthitiḥ  | sāmarthya bhedāt bhinnaḥ api bhavati eka nibandhanam || 	The ‘recalling’ of such notions as ‘by me (seen, heard)’, etc. must be due to perturbations of ignorance; as such notions of the one-ness of the agent (perceiver) are found to appear also in connection with all momentary things. from this false assumption, it cannot be right to deduce any conclusion regarding the true state of things; specially as even things that are diverse by reason of the diversity of their powers become the basis of an effect conceived of as one 
eka anugāmi kārya tve paurvāparyam virudhyate | rūpa śabda ādi cittānām śakta kāraṇa sannidheḥ || 	If many things—such as the cognitions of colour, sound and the rest,—were the effects of a single continuous (permanent) cause,—then any order of sequence among such effects would be incongruous; as their efficient cause would be always there 
eka anantara vijñānāt ṣaṣ vijñāna samudbhavaḥ | yugapad vedyate vyaktam atas iṣṭa prasādhanam || 	Inasmuch as the appearance of six cognitions out of a single preceding cognition is clearly recognised simultaneously,—what your argument proves is admitted (by us) 
kramiṇām tu eka hetu tvam na eva iti uktam anantaram | atas anumāna bādhā asmin vyāpteḥ vyaktam samīkṣyate  || 	That things appearing consecutively, one after the other, cannot have one and the same cause, has just been pointed out. for this reason, herein the (opponent’s) premiss asserting the invariable concomitance is found to be clearly annulled by inference 
narttakī bhrū latā bhaṅgaḥ na eva ekaḥ paramārthataḥ | aneka aṇu samūha tvāt eka tvam tasya kalpitam || 	As for the ‘glance of the dancing girl’, it is not really a single entity; in fact it is made up of several minute particles; and its ‘one-ness’ is only assumed

nabhastala aravinda ādau yat ekam viniveśyate | kāraka ādi padam tena vyabhicāraḥ api dṛśyate || 	The reason is found to be false also; when, for instance, names, such as ‘kāraka’ (active agent), and the like, are applied to things like the ‘sky-lotus 
saṅketa mātra bhāvinyaḥ vācaḥ kutra na saṅgatāḥ  | na eva ātma ādi padānām ca prakṛtyā artha prakāśanam || 	The use of] terms being based entirely on convention,—what is there to which they cannot be applied?—In the case of terms like ‘soul’ also, there is nothing in their very nature which is expressive of anything

evam ca sādhanaiḥ sarvaiḥ ātma sattva aprasiddhitaḥ  | nitya vyāpi tvayoḥ uktam sādhya hīnam nidarśanam || 	Thus the existence of the ‘soul’ not being proved by any of the proofs (put forward), the instances that have been cited of ‘eternality’ and ‘omnipresence’ become ‘devoid of the probandum’ 
anyaiḥ pratyakṣa siddha tvam ātmanaḥ parikalpitam | sva saṃvedyaḥ hi ahaṅkāraḥ tasya ātmā viṣayaḥ mataḥ || 	Others have assumed that the ‘soul’ is proved by perception; because ‘i-consciousness’ is self-cognisable, and the soul forms the object of that consciousness 
tat ayuktam ahaṅkāre tad rūpa anavabhāsanāt | na hi nitya vibhu tva ādi nirbhāsaḥ tatra lakṣyate || gaura varṇa ādi nirbhāsaḥ vyaktam tatra tu vidyate | tad svabhāvaḥ na ca ātma iṣṭaḥ na ayam tad viṣayaḥ tatas || 	This is not right; because as a matter of fact, the form of the ‘soul’ does hot become manifest in ‘I-consciousness’; therein is not perceived any manifestation of eternality, omnipresence and such properties (postulated of the soul); what is clearly present therein, on the other hand, is the ‘fair complexion’, etc.; and the ‘soul’ is not held to be of the nature of these latter;—hence the ‘soul’ cannot be an object of ‘I-consciousness’ 
yadi pratyakṣa gamyaḥ ca satyataḥ puruṣaḥ bhavet | tat kimartham vivādaḥ ayam tad sattva ādau pravarttate || 	If the soul were really amenable to perception, then wherefore should this dispute arise regarding its existence and other things? 
tathā hi niścaya ātmā ayam ahaṅkāraḥ pravarttate | niścaya āropa buddhyoḥ ca bādhya bādhaka tā sthitā || 	The ‘I-consciousness’ always functions in the form of a definite cognition; and between a definite cognition and a mere indefinite conception, there is always the relation of ‘the annuller and the annulled’, 
tasmāt icchā ādayaḥ sarve na eva ātma samavāyinaḥ | krameṇa utpadyamāna tvāt bīja aṅkura latā ādi vat || atha vā ādhyātmikāḥ sarve nairātmya ākrānta mūrtayaḥ | vastu sattva ādi hetubhyaḥ yathā bāhyāḥ ghaṭa ādayaḥ || 	Thus it follows that desire and all the rest cannot subsist in the ‘soul’;—because they appear successively,—like the ‘seed—sprout—creeper’.—Or, all psychical (subjective) concepts must be regarded as having their forms obsessed by ‘absence of soul’,—because of such reasons as ‘being things’, ‘being existent’ and so forth,—just like the jar and other external objects 
sa ātmaka tve hi nitya tvam tad hetūnām prasajyate | nityāḥ ca artha kriyā aśaktā na atas sattva ādi sambhavaḥ || 	If the things in question were connected with the soul, then the things caused by that (soul) would have to be regarded as eternal; and being eternal, they would yet be powerless for effective action. consequently it would not be possible for them to have the properties of ‘existence’ and the rest 
ghaṭa ādiṣu samānam ca yavaiḥ ātmāyat nairātmyam niṣidhyate | paraiḥ jīvat śarīre asmin tat asmābhiḥ prasādhyate || 	That ‘negation of the soul’ which other people seek to prove in regard to the jar and other things,—that same we are going to prove in regard to the living body 
ittham ātma aprasiddhau ca prakriyā tatra yā kṛtā  | nirāspadā eva sā sarvā vandhyā putraḥ iva sthitā || 	Thus the ‘soul’ being something ‘not-proyed’, the entire fabric (of conceptions) that has been adopted in regard to it, becomes baseless like ‘the son of the barren woman’ 
vyāvṛtti anugama ātmānam ātmānam apare punar  | caitanya rūpam icchanti caitanyam buddhi lakṣaṇam || 	Others again have declared the ‘soul’ to be of the nature of caitanya, sentience, exclusive and inclusive in character;—this caitanya (sentience) being the same as buddhi (intelligence) 
yathā aheḥ kuṇḍala avasthā vyapaiti tad anantaram | saṃbhavati ārjava avasthā sarpa tvam tu anuvarttate || tathā eva nitya caitanya svabhāvasya ātmanaḥ api na | niḥśeṣa rūpa vigamaḥ sarvasya anugamaḥ api vā || kintu asya vinivarttante sukha duḥkha ādi lakṣaṇāḥ | avasthāḥ tāḥ ca jāyante caitanyam tu anuvarttate || 	Just as, in the case of the serpent, the ‘coiled’ form disappears, and after that, appears the ‘straightened’ form; but the character of being ‘serpent’ continues through both states;—in the same manner, in the case of the soul, there is no complete disappearance of the character of ‘eternal sentience’; nor is there continuance of its whole character; there is disappearance of such of its states as ‘pleasure’, ‘pain’ and the like,—and these appear again; but through all these ‘sentience’ continues.” 
syātām hi atyanta nāśe asya kṛta nāśa akṛta āgamau | sukha duḥkha ādi bhogaḥ ca na eva syāt eka rūpiṇaḥ || 	If there were absolute destruction of the soul, there would be ‘destruction of what is done and the befalling of what is not done’; and if the soul always remained of the same form, then there could be no experiencing of pleasure, pain and the rest.” 
na ca kartṛ tva bhoktṛ tve puṃsaḥ avasthām samāśrite | tatas avasthāvataḥ tattvāt karttā eva āpnoti tad phalam || 	The soul’s characters of ‘doer’ and ‘experiencer’ are not dependent upon the state; hence, as it is the soul itself that remains the same through the various states, it is the doer of the act that always obtains (experiences) the fruit of that act.” 
pumān evaṃvidhaḥ ca ayam pratyabhijñāna bhāvataḥ | pramīyate prabādhā ca nairātmyasya amunā eva hi || 	The spirit (or soul) as described is proved by the presence of recognition; and the doctrine of ‘no-soul’ is disproved by this same (recognition).” 
aham vedmi iti ahaṃbuddhiḥ jñātāram pratipadyate  | sa ca ātmā yadi vā jñānam syāt ekānta vinaśvaram  || yadi ātmā viṣayaḥ tasyāḥ catur asram tadā akhilam  | kṣaṇika jñāna pakṣe tu sarvam eva ati durghaṭam  || tathā hi jñātavān pūrvam aham eva ca samprati | aham eva pravedmi iti yā buddhiḥ upajāyate || tasyāḥ jñāna kṣaṇaḥ kaḥ nu viṣayaḥ parikalpyate  | atītaḥ sāmprataḥ kim vā kim vā asau atha santatiḥ  || tatra ādye viṣaye jñāte j 	The notion of ‘I’ involved in the conception ‘I know’ envisages the cogniser; this cogniser may be either the ‘soul’ or the absolutely evanescent ‘cognition’ (idea). If it is the ‘soul’ that is the objective of that notion, then all is square; on the other hand, if the momentary ‘cognition’ (idea) is held to be so, then all becomes inexplicably confounded. For instance, the notion that appears in the form ‘it was I who cognised this thing on a previous occasion, and it is I who am cognising it now’,—of this notion, what ‘cognitive moment’ is assumed to be the objective? would such a ‘moment’ be (a) past, or (b) present, or (c) in the form of a continued series? if it be the first (a), the moment could well be the objective of the notion ‘I cognised it (in the past)’; but it could not be the objective of the notion ‘I am cognising it (now)’, because the cogniser is not cognising the thing at the moment of speaking; it is only when the object is present at the time (of cognition) that it can be spoken of as ‘I am cognising it but (in regard to such a present object) it would not be true to say ‘I cognised it’, because the object did not exist in the past.—From this it follows that both of these (past and present) cannot form the objective of the said notion. Nor did both ‘cognitive moments’ cognise the thing in the past; nor do they both cognise it in the present 
vyatīta ahaṅkṛti grāhyaḥ jñātā adyā api anuvarttate  | aham pratyaya gamya tvāt idānīntana boddhṛ vat || eṣa vā hyastanaḥ jñātā jñātṛ tvāt tatas eva vā  | hyastana jñātṛ vat teṣām pratyayānām ca sādhya tā || 	The ‘cogniser’ who formed the object of ‘I-consciousness’ in the past must be regarded as continuing to exist to-day,—because he is the object of ‘I-consciousness’,—like the cogniser in the present.—Or, he (the present cogniser) must be regarded as haying been the cogniser of yesterday,—because he is the cogniser;—or because of the same reason (of being the object of ‘I-consciousness’),—like the cogniser of yesterday; and all these fulfill the conditions of the probandum.” 
eka santāna sambandha jñātṛ aham pratyaya tvataḥ  | hi astana ādyatanāḥ sarve tulya arthāḥ eka buddhi vat || 	All (I-notions) of yesterday and of to-day must have the same object,—because they are i-notions belonging to the cogniser connected with one and the same ‘chain’,—like any single cognition.” 
tat atra cintyate nityam ekam caitanyam iṣyate | yadi buddhiḥ api prāptā tad rūpā eva tathā sati || 	In this connection, the following points are to be considered:—if intelligence is held to be eternal and one, then, cognition also should have to be regarded as of the same character 
buddhīnām api caitanya svābhāvyāt puruṣasya ca | nitya tvam ekatā ceṣṭā bhedaḥ ced viṣaya āśrayaḥ || 	Cognitions, and the soul also, are held to be eternal and one, on the ground of their being of the nature of ‘intelligence’; if there is diversity, it is due to the object.” 
svarūpeṇa tathā vahniḥ nityam dahana dharmakaḥ | upanītam dahati artham dāhyam na anyat na ca anyadā || 	Though, by its very nature, fire is always of the nature of a burner, it burns only what is presented to it,—and that also only a thing that is capable of being burnt,—not any other thing, nor at any other time.” 
yathā vā darpaṇaḥ su acchaḥ yathā vā sphaṭika upalaḥ  | yat eva ādhīyate tatra tat chāyām pratipadyate  || tathā eva nitya caitanyāḥ pumāṃsaḥ deha vṛttayaḥ | gṛhṇanti karaṇa ānītān rūpa ādīn dhīḥ asau ca naḥ || 	Or, the clean mirror, or the rock-crystal, reflects the image of only what is placed before it in the same manner, souls, though possessed of eternal sentience, apprehend colour and other things only when they are themselves in the body and the things are presented to them by the organs. and it is this sentience that we call ‘intelligence’.” 
tena upanetṛ saṃrambha bhaṅgi tvāt bhaṅginī matiḥ | na nityam dāhakaḥ vahniḥ dāhya asannidhinā yathā || 	It is on account of the evanescent character of the functioning of the presenting organs that the cognition is evanescent; just as, even though fire is always a burner, it burns only when the combustible thing is close to it.” 
tatra bodha ātmaka tvena pratyabhijñāyate matiḥ | ghaṭahasti ādi buddhi tvam tad bhedāt loka saṃmatam || 	Cognition is always recognised as being of the nature of ‘intelligence’; as regards the cognitions of the jar, the elephant and so forth, their diversity is held by people to be due to the diversity among those things.” 
sā eva iti na ucyate buddhiḥ artha bheda anusāribhiḥ | na ca asti apratyabhijñānam artha bhede anupāśrite || 	People who follow up the diversity among the objects cognised do not speak of the cognition as ‘that same cognition’; nor is there non-recognition of it as ‘cognition so long as notice is not taken of the diversity among the objects.” 
nanu hasti ādi śūnyāyām bhūmau āropakāriṇaḥ | pratyayāḥ ye pravarttante bhedaḥ tatra kimāśrayaḥ || 	If such is the case, then, on the occasion when there appear. cognitions imposing the concepts of ‘elephant’ and the rest in reference to spots where these animals do not exist,—to what is the diversity in such cognitions due? 
anya deśa ādi bhāvinyaḥ vyaktayaḥ ced nibandhanam | sarvatra ālambanam yasmāt deśa kāla anyathā ātmakam || 	If the individual objects existing at other times and places be held to supply the basis for such imposed cognitions,—on the ground that in all cognitions the basis of reality is supplied by objects existing at times and places other than those of the appearance of the cognitions themselves,—[then the answer would be as stated in the following text] 
nanu tad deśa sambandhaḥ na eva tāsām tathā asti tat | kim iti pratibhāsante tena rūpeṇa tatra ca || 	But as a matter of fact, the cognitions in question have no such connection with that particular place; why then should they appear in that form at that place? 
bhavat mate hi na ākāraḥ buddheḥ bāhyaḥ tu varṇyate | na vivakṣita deśe ca gaja yaṣṭi ādayaḥ sthitāḥ || 	Then again, under your view, the external form is not declared to belong to the cognition; nor are the elephant, pole and other things actually existent at the place desired 
sarva artha bodha rūpā ca yadi buddhiḥ sadā sthitā | sarvadā sarva saṃvittiḥ tat kimartham na vidyate || 	If cognition remains for ever in the form of the apprehension of all things,—then how is it that the cognition of all things is not present at all times? 
śabda upadhānā yā buddhī rasa rūpa ādi gocarā | sā eva hi iti na ced bhedāḥ tvayā ca eva upapāditāḥ || 	That cognition on which sound has been imposed must be the same that apprehends taste, colour and other things. if this is not admitted by you, then you have, by your own words, admitted that there is difference among cognitions 
samasta dāhya rūpāṇām na nityam dahana ātmakaḥ | kṛśānuḥ api niḥśeṣam anyathā bhasmasāt bhavet || 	Even fire is not always a ‘burner’ of all combustible things; otherwise the whole (world) would be instantly reduced to ashes 
dāhya artha sannidhau eva tasya tad dāhaka ātma tā | yuktā sarva artha dāhaḥ hi sakṛt evam na sajyate || 	In fact, it is only when it is in close proximity to the combustible thing that fire can be rightly regarded as the burner; thus it is why there does not happen the contingency of all things being burnt all at once 
nīlotpala ādi sambandhāt darpaṇa sphaṭika ādayaḥ | tad chāyā vibhrama utpāda hetavaḥ kṣaṇabhaṅginaḥ || sa upadhāna itara avasthaḥ ekaḥ eva iti sarvadā | tad chāyaḥ tad viyuktaḥ vā sa dṛśyeta anyathā punar || 	All such things as the mirror, the rock-crystal and the like are themselves in perpetual flux; and when they become connected with the blue lotus and such objects,—they become causes of bringing about the illusion regarding their reflections.—If that were not so, everyone of those things would be always one and the same,—when in contact with the said objects, as well as when not in contact with them; and as such it should be seen either as always with its reflection or always without its reflection 
sthira tvāt nirvibhāga tvāt mūrttānām asaha sthiteḥ  | bibhartti darpaṇa talam na eva chāyām kadācana || 	As a matter of fact, the mirror-surface can never contain the reflection (of anything),—because it is lasting, because it is indivisible, and because several things with material shape cannot subsist together 
pārśva dvitaya saṃsthāḥ ca su śuklam sphaṭika upalam | samīkṣyante tat eṣaḥ api na chāyām pratipannavān || 	Persons standing on the two sides of it perceive only the purely white rock-crystal; hence it follows that this also does not become transformed into the reflection 
bhedaḥ pratyupadhānam ca sphaṭika ādeḥ prasajyate | tad chāyā pratipattiḥ ced tasya vidyeta tātvikī || 	The opponent’s theory would also entail the incongruity of the rock-crystal becoming different with each object placed before it,—if there were a real transformation of it into the reflection 
tasmāt bhrāntiḥ iyam teṣu vicitrā acintya śaktiṣu | 	From this it follows that the said perception of the reflection is an illusion,—appearing in connection with things possessed of diverse unthinkable potencies 
na buddhau bhrānti bhāvaḥ api yuktaḥ bheda viyogataḥ || 	262a) In the case of cognition, there cannot be even illusion; as there is absence of difference 
abodha rūpa bhedam tu samānam sarva buddhiṣu | āropya pratyabhijñānam nānātve api pravarttate || 	The character of being different from non-cognition is one that is common to all cognitions; and the said recognition could proceed on the basis of the imposition of that common character,—even under the view of cognitions being many and diverse 
avasthā bheda bhedena śūnye api ekāntataḥ sthite | sthira ātmani ryat paraiḥ parikalpyate || sukha duḥkha ādi avasthāḥ ca gacchan api naraḥ mama | caitanya dravya sattva ādi rūpam na eva vimuñcati || 	The permanent soul having been absolutely established as devoid of diversity due to the diversity of states,—what people assume to be the states of happiness and unhappiness and the rest,—even when undergoing all these states, my person (soul) does not renounce his character of being sentient, being a substance, being an entity and so forth.” [Ślokavārtika, page 695] 
na ca avasthā antara utpāde pūrvā atyantam vinaśyati | uttara anuguṇa artham tu sāmānya ātmani līyate || 	Even on the appearance of a new state, the preceding state is not entirely destroyed; it becomes merged into the common character, in order to help the appearance of the next state.” [Ślokavārtika, page 596] 
svarūpeṇa hi avasthānām anyonyasya virodhi tā | aviruddhaḥ tu sarvāsu sāmānya ātmā pratīyate || 	The states, in their own forms, are mutually incompatible; as for the common character, however, it is not incompatible with any state, and it is actually recognised, in its common form, in all states.” Ślokavārtika, page 696 
tatra no ced avasthānām ekāntena vibhinna tā | puruṣāt tad vyaya utpāde syātām asya api tau tathā || 	If the states are not entirely different from the soul, then there should be destruction and origination of the soul also, following upon the destruction and origination of the states 
viruddha dharma saṅge tu bhedaḥ ekāntikaḥ bhavet | puṃsām iva svabhāvena pratisvam niyatena te || 	If there be presence of contradictory properties, then there should be absolute difference; just as in the case of your souls which are absolutely different from each other, through the distinctive character belonging to each of them 
svarūpeṇa eva līyante yadi avasthāḥ ca puṃsi vaḥ | duḥkha ādi api anubhūyeta tad sukha ādi samudbhave || 	If your ‘states’ become merged into the soul in their own form, then, on the appearance of happxness, unhappiness also should be felt 
na ca anya rūpa saṅkrāntau anya saṅkrānti sambhavaḥ  | tādātmyena ca saṅkrāntiḥ iti ātma udayavān bhavet  || 	As a matter of fact, when there is transference of one form to something, there can be no transference of another form. so that if the states became transferred (merged into the soul) in their own form, then the soul also would be something liable to origination 
yadi kartṛ tva bhoktṛ tve na eva avasthām samāśrite | tad avasthāvataḥ tatvāt na kartṛ tva ādi saṃbhavaḥ || 	If the characters of doer and experiencer are not dependent upon the state,—then the said characters cannot belong to the soul,—as they can belong to only one who has that state 
tat nitya śabda vācya tvam na ātmanaḥ vinivāryate | svarūpa vikriyāvat tvāt vyucchedaḥ tasya vidyate || 	For these reasons, we are not denying the fact of the soul being spoken of by the term ‘eternal’; but on account of its form being subject to modification, there mest be destrection of it 
sarpaḥ api kṣaṇabhaṅgi tvāt kauṭilya ādīn prapadyate | sthira rūpe tu puṃsi iva na avasthā antara saṅgatiḥ || 	The serpent also is liable to become crooked and so forth, becaese it is sebject to perpetual flex; if it had a permanent form, then, like the soul, it could neyer come by another state 
nirālambanaḥ eva ayam ahaṅkāraḥ pravarttate | anādi sattva dṛś bīja prabhāvāt kvacid eva hi || 	As a matter of fact, the ‘notion of I’ comes about without a real basis, through the force of the beginningless seed of the vision of being; and that also only in some places 
kecid eva hi saṃskārāḥ tad rūpa adhyavasāyini | avetyam ādhipatyam prapadyante tat na sarvatra varttate || 	It is only some (not all) impressions that secure the requisite potency for bringing about the said notion apprehending that particular form; hence it does not appear everywhere 
tulyaḥ paryanuyogaḥ ayam anyathā puruṣe api vaḥ | tad śakti bheda sadbhāvāt sarvam eva nirākulam || 	If this were not so,—the objection in question could be urged with equal force against your ‘soul’ also; but all difficulties are removed by the fact that there is diversity in its potencies 
nitya ālambana pakṣe tu sarva ahaṅkṛtayaḥ tatas  | sakṛt eva prasūyeran śakta hetu vyavasthiteḥ || anitya ālambana tve api spaṣṭa ābhāḥ syuḥ tatas pare | ālambana artha sadbhāvam vyartham paryanuyuñjate || 	If the said notion (of ‘I’) had an eternal thing for its basis, then all ‘I-notions’ would come about all at once, as their efficient cause would be always present.—if it had a non-eternal basis, then all these notions would be equally clearly manifest. hence (it follows that) the other parties needlessly raise questions regarding the existence of the basis of the said I-notion 
jñātari pratyabhijñānam vāsanā kartum arhati | na a tasmin saḥ iti prajñām na hi asau bhrānti kāraṇam || tat na ahaṃpratyayaḥ bhrāntiḥ iṣṭaḥ ced bādha varjanāt | na anantara uktayā yuktyā tasya bādha upadarśanāt || 	What the disposition can do is to bring about the recognition of the cogniser; it cannot bring about the cognition of a thing as what it is not; because it cannot be the cause of illusion (wrong cognition).—Thus the ‘I-notion’ cannot be regarded as an illusion; as there is nothing to annul it (and hence prove it to be wrong)”;—[Ślokavārtika, page 720]—if this is urged [then the answer is as given in the following text] 280-281a) What has been urged is hot right; as the reasoning adduced above is clearly found to be subversive of the said idea 
īśvara ādiṣu bhaktānām tad hetu tva ādi vibhramāḥ | vāsanā mātra bhāvāt ca jāyante vividhāḥ katham || 	281b) How is it that, entirely from dispositions,—such diverse illusions come about as those that devotees have in regard to god and other beings as being the cause of things and so forth? 
nirālambana tā ca evam ahaṅkāre yadā sthitā  | tat na ahaṃpratyaya grāhye jñātā kaścana vidyate || tatas sarva pramāṇeṣu na dṛṣṭāntaḥ asti siddhi bhāj | hetavaḥ ca āśraya asiddhāḥ yathāyogam udāhṛtāḥ || 	Thus then, the baselessness of ‘I-consciousness’ having been established, there can be no cogniser who could be apprehended by the said ‘notion of I’. Hence among all valid forms of cognition, there is not one which is found able to supply a fit example; and the reasons also that have been adduced in due course are found to be ‘unproven’ regarding their substratum 
caitanyam anye manyante bhinnam buddhi svarūpataḥ | ātmanaḥ ca nijam rūpam caitanyam kalpayanti te || pradhānena upanītam ca phalam bhuṅkte sa kevalam | kartṛ tvam na eva tasya asti prakṛteḥ eva tat matam || 	Others hold caitanya ‘sentience’ to be distinct from the form of buddhi, intellect (cognition). They postulate ‘sentience’ as the ‘spirit’s’ own form; he only enjoys the fruits presented to him by primordial matter; he is not the ‘doer’; the character of ‘doer’ is held to belong to primordial matter alone 
tatra api rūpa śabda ādi cetasām vedyate katham | su vyaktam bhedavat rūpam ekā ced cetanā iṣyate || 	As regards this doctrine, if ‘sentience’ is held to be one only, then how is it that, in the cognitions of colour, sound and other objects, what is clearly perceived is a form beset with diversity?. 
eka rūpe ca caitanye sarvakālam avasthite | nānāvidha artha bhoktṛ tvam katham nāma upapadyate || 	If ‘sentience’ is of one form and continues to exist for all time, then, how is it possible for the sentient soul to be the enjoyer of things of many kinds? 
na didṛkṣā ādayaḥ bhinnāḥ tasya bhoga nibandhanam | bhavanti hi tathā bhāve pumān utpattimān bhavet || 	The ‘desire to see’ and the like, which are diverse, do not come into existence as forming the basis of the spirit’s experience; for, if they did so, then the soul itself would be something produced 
caitanya vyatiriktam hi na didṛkṣā ādi vidyate | tasya udaya vyaya āveśe durvāraḥ puruṣe api asau || 	The ‘desire to see’ and the rest are not anything distinct prom ‘sentience’; and if this latter were liable to ‘appearance and disappearance’, then the same could not be denied of the soul 
śubha aśubham ca karma asti na eva ced ātmanā kṛtam | tat eṣa bhoga bhedaḥ asya kutas samupajāyate || 	If good and bad deeds are not done by the soul, then wherefrom does this diversity in his experiences proceed? 
abhilāṣa anurūpeṇa prakṛtiḥ ced prayacchati | paṅgu andha vat hi saṃbandhaḥ tayoḥ eṣa vyavasthitaḥ || 	If it be held that—“it is primordial matter that bestows the fruits, in accordance with the desires of the soul; and this relationship between the two stands like that between the lame and the blind persons”,—[then the answer is as given in the following text] 
yadi evam iṣṭa vāñchāyām satyām api na siddhyati | kim iti prakṛtiḥ na eva kiñcid anyat apekṣate || 	If that is so, then how is it that even when the desire for the desired thing is there, it is not fulfilled? primordial matter cannot stand in need of anything else

ucyate pratibimbasya tādātmyena samudbhave | tat eva udaya yogi tvam vibhede tu na bhoktṛ tā || 	Our answer to this is as follows:—If the reflection appears in the same form (as the reflecting substance), then the same liability to ‘appearance and disappearance’ remains.—If, on the other hand, it is different, then the spirit cannot be the enjoyer 
didṛkṣā ādi ānukūlyena pradhānam saṃpravarttate | vicitra racanā bhede katham vā acetana ātmakam || 	If primordial matter operates towards bringing about the diversified creation, in accordance with the (spirit’s) ‘desire to see’ and the rest,—then how can it be insentient? 
kaṃrtu nāma prajānāti pradhānam vyañjana ādikam | bhoktum ca na vijānāti kim ayuktam atas param || 	Primordial matter knows how to produce the soup and other things, and yet does not know how to eat (enjoy) them,—what can be more incongruous than this?

acetana ātmikā buddhiḥ śabda gandha rasa ādi vat | utpattimat tva nāśi tva hetubhyām iti ced matam || 	Cosmic intellect must be insentient by its nature,—like sound odour, taste and other things,—on account of the two reasons of being produced and being perishable”,—if this be your view—[then the answer is as stated in the following text] 
na etau hetū dvayoḥ siddhau svatantre sādhane mate | na viparyaya bādhā asti prasaṅgaḥ api abhidhitsite || 	If the reasons adduced are meant to be self-sufficient, then they are not admitted by both (parties); if the reasons are meant to be indirect, then there is nothing to annul the contrary conclusion

On the other hand, if it is meant to prove that they are helpful to something that is unmodifiable,—then the reasoning is open to the fallacy of the corroborative instance being devoid of the probandum; as the things cited as the instance are also helpful only to what is mobile (perishable).—Lastly, if what is meant to be proved is merely the vague general fact of their being helpful to ‘another’,—even so, the reason would be superfluous; as they are already admitted to be helpful to the mind 
jaiminīyāḥ iva prāhuḥ jaināḥ cit lakṣaṇam naram | dravya paryāya rūpeṇa vyāvṛtti anugama ātmakam || 	This Jainas, like the Mīmāṃsakas, assert that the person (soul) is characterised by ‘sentience’; that, in the form of ‘substance’, it is inclusive, and in the form of ‘successive factors’, it is exclusive 
tatra api avikṛtam dravyam paryāyaiḥ yadi saṅgatam | na viśeṣaḥ asti tasya iti pariṇāmi na tat bhavet || 	Under this view also, if. the unmodified substance is connected with the successive factors, then there is no difference (change) in it, and, in that case, it could not be liable to modification

svabhāva abhedaḥ eka tvam tasmin sati ca bhinna tā | kathaṃcid api duḥsādhyā paryāya ātma svarūpa vat || 	One-ness’ (sameness, identity) consists in non-difference of nature were there if this ‘one-ness’ (between two things), then ‘difference’ (between them) world be hard to prove in any way; as in the case of the forms of the successive factors themselves

The ‘one-ness’ thus between ‘substance’ and the ‘successive factors’ being not-figurative (i.e. real), the ‘substance’ also should be distributive (exclusive), like the forms of the ‘successive factors’; or those ‘successive factors’ themselves should be comprehensive in their character, like the ‘substance because the one-ness of these with ‘substance’ is duly established 
tatas na avasthitam kiñcid dravyam ātma ādi vidyate | paryāya avyatirikta tvāt paryāyāṇām svarūpa vat || 	From all this it follows that there is no such lasting ‘substance’ as the ‘soul’ and the like; because they are not different from the ‘successive factors’,—like the form of the ‘successive factors’ themselves 
na ca udaya vyaya ākrāntāḥ paryāyāḥ api kecana | dravyāt avyatirikta tvāt tad dravya niyata ātma vat || 	None of the ‘successive factors’ also can be beset with ‘appearance and disappearance’,—because they are non-different from ‘substance’,—like the permanent form of the ‘substance.’ 
tatas niranvayaḥ dhvaṃsaḥ sthiram vā sarvam iṣyatām | eka ātmani tu na eva staḥ vyāvṛtti anugamau imau || 	For this reason it should be admitted, either that there is absolute destruction of all, or that all is permanent (eternal); exclusiveness and inclusiveness could not exist in any single thing 
na ca upalabhya rūpasya paryāya anugata ātmanaḥ | dravyasya pratibhāsaḥ asti tat na asti gagana abja vat || 	As a matter of fact, there is no perception of ‘substance’, which should be perceptible, as something permeating through (and comprehensive of) the ‘successive factors’,—hence it cannot be regarded as existing,—like the ‘sky-lotus’ 
vividha artha kriyā yogyāḥ tulya ādi jñāna hetavaḥ | tathāvidha artha saṅketa śabda pratyaya gocarāḥ || 	In fact, things are capable of diverse fruitful actions;—they are causes of the notions of ‘similarity’ and the best;—and they are amenable to conventional verbal expressions connoting such things 
udaya vyaya dharmāṇaḥ paryāyāḥ eva kevalāḥ  | saṃvedyante tatas spaṣṭam nairātmyam ca ati nirmalam || 	In fact, it is only the ‘successive factors’ that are cognised as characterised by ‘appearance and disappearance’; hence pure ‘soullessness’ becomes clearly established 
atha sat mūrchitam rūpam dravya paryāyayoḥ sthitam | tat dvi rūpam hi nirbhāgam narasiṃha vat iṣyate || 	It might be urged that—“what exists is the mixed form of the ‘substance’ and the ‘successive factors’,—because it is held to be dual in form, but impartite,—like Narasiṃha.” 
nanu dvi rūpam iti eva nānā artha vinibandhanaḥ | nirdeśaḥ rūpa śabdena svabhāvasya abhidhānataḥ || 	The assertion that ‘a certain thing is of dual form’ can be based on the existence of several things,—because the term ‘form’ connotes nature 
narasiṃhaḥ api nā eva ekaḥ dvi ātmakaḥ ca upapadyate | aneka aṇu samūha ātmā sa tathā hi pratīyate || 	Narasiṃha also cannot be one and also of ‘dual nature’; as he is perceived as such because he is an aggregate of many atoms 
nitya jñāna vivartaḥ ayam kṣiti tejaḥ jala ādikaḥ | ātmā tad ātmakaḥ ca iti saṅgirante apare punar || 	Others assert that—“The earth, eire, water etc. are the illusory modifications of eternal consciousness, and this is what constitutes the ‘soul’.”

rūpa ādi vittitaḥ bhinnam na jñānam upalabhyate | tasyāḥ pratikṣaṇam bhede kim abhinnam vyavasthitam || 	Cognition or consciousness is never apprehended as anything distinct from the cognitions of colour and other things; and inasmuch as these latter undergo variations every moment, what remains there that could be lasting (permanent, eternal)? 
viparyasta aviparyasta jñāna bhedaḥ na vidyate | eka jñāna ātmake puṃsi bandha maukṣau tatas katham || 	There can be no distinction in cognition as ‘wrong’ and ‘right’—if the ‘soul’ consists of a single (eternal) cognition; how then can there be any ‘bondage’ and ‘liberation’?

What too is there that could be rejected? As wrong cognition also is of the nature of the same (eternal cognition).—The knowledge of truth also cannot be something to be brought about; as, being of the nature of cognition, it is always there.—So that the entire practice of yoga also is entirely fruitless 
kecid tu saugatam manyāḥ api ātmānam pracakṣate | pudgala vyapadeśena tattva anya tva ādi varjitam || 	Some people who regard themselves as ‘Bauddhas’ describe the soul by the name of ‘pudgala’, and declare it to be neither the same as, nor different fromthe skandhas, thought-phases) 
skandhebhyaḥ pudgalaḥ na anyaḥ tīrtha dṛṣṭi prasaṅgataḥ  | na ananyaḥ aneka tā ādi āpteḥ sādhuḥ tasmāt avācya tā || 	The ‘pudgala’ cannot be spoken of as ‘different’ from the thought-phases,—as in that case this doctrine would be the same as those of the ‘tairthika philosophers’;—nor can it be spoken of as the ‘same’ (non-different); as, in that case, it would have to be regarded as ‘more than one’ (many) and so forth;—hence it is best to regard it as ‘incapable of being spoken of’ (as either the one or the other) 
te vācyāḥ pudgalaḥ na eva vidyate pāramārthikaḥ | tattva anya tvāt avācya tvāt nabhaḥ kokanada ādi vat || 	These people should be told that (according to what they have said), the pudgala cannot be regarded as existing in reality;—because it is incapable of being spoken of either as the same or as different (from thought-phases);—just like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such non-entities 
anya tvam vā api ananya tvam vastu na eva ativarttate | vastutas yat tu nīrūpam tat avācyam prakalpyate || 	A thing cannot escape being either ‘same as’ or ‘different from’, another thing; in fact, it is only what is entirely formless that can be regarded as ‘incapable of being so spoken of

skandhebhyaḥ pudgalaḥ na anyaḥ iti eṣā ananya sūcanā  | skandhaḥ na pudgalaḥ ca iti vyaktā tasya iyam anya tā || 	Your words that “the pudgala is not different from the thought-phases’ are a clear assertion of its non-difference; while the words ‘the thought-phase is not the pudgala’ clearly asserts its difference 
viruddha dharma saṅgaḥ hi vastūnām bhedaḥ ucyate | skandha pudgalayoḥ ca eva vidyate bhinna tā na kim || 	The presence of contrary properties is spoken of as constituting ‘difference’ among entities; is there no such ‘difference’ between the pudgala and the thought-phases? 
tathā hi vedanā ādibhyaḥ pudgalaḥ avācyaḥ ucyate | tattva anya tvena vācyāḥ tu rūpa saṃjñā ādayaḥ tatas || 	For instance, the pudgala is said to be ‘incapable of being spoken of’ as different or non-different from feeling and the rest, while colour, name and other things are said to be ‘capable of being spoken of’ as different from them 
anitya tvena vācyāḥ ca rūpa skandha ādayaḥ matāḥ | pudgalaḥ tu tathā na iti tatas vispaṣṭam anya tā || 	The ‘colour-phase’ and the rest are held to be ‘capable of being spoken of’ as ‘non-eternal’; while the pudgala is not so; so that there is a clear difference between the two 
artha kriyāsu śaktiḥ ca vidyamāna tva lakṣaṇam | kṣaṇikeṣu eva niyatā tathā avācye na vastu tā || 	Capacity for effective action is the differentia of the existence (of a thing); and such capacity is restricted to momentary entities only; hence if anything is ‘incapable of being spoken of (as momentary)’, it cannot be an existent entity 
āgama artha virodhe tu parākrāntam mahātmabhiḥ | nāstikya pratiṣedhāya citrāḥ vācaḥ dayāvataḥ || 	Great men have successfully explained all those cases where there is conflict between ‘scripture’ and the real state of things. in fact the diverse teachings of the merciful one are for the purpose of rebutting ‘unbelief’ (nāstikya)

kṛtaka akṛtaka tvena dvairāśyam kaiścid iṣyate | kṣaṇika akṣaṇika tvena bhāvānām aparaiḥ matam || 	Some people hold that there are two classes of things—cheated and uncreated; others have held that the two classes op things are momentary and non-momentary 
tatra ye kṛtakāḥ bhāvāḥ te sarve kṣaṇabhaṅginaḥ | vināśam prati sarveṣām anapekṣa tayā sthiteḥ || 	Among these, all those things that are ‘created’ are in ‘perpetual flux’,—because, as regards their destruction, all of them are entirely independent

anapekṣaḥ api yadi eṣa deśa kāla antare bhavet | tad apekṣa tayā na eṣa nirapekṣaḥ prasajyate || 	Even though independent, if the destruction were to come at another place and time,—then, on account op its being dependent upon those, the thing could not be regarded as ‘independent’ 
sarvatra eva anapekṣāḥ ca vināśe janminaḥ akhilāḥ | sarvathā nāśa hetūnām tatra akiñcitkara tvataḥ || 	All produced things are always and everywhere independent in regard to their destruction; as in this matter, all causes of destruction are entirely inefficacious 
tathā hi nāśakaḥ hetuḥ na bhāva avyatirekiṇaḥ | nāśasya kārakaḥ yuktaḥ sva hetoḥ bhāva janmataḥ || 	For instance, the ‘destructive cause’ cannot be rightly regarded as the bringer about op a ‘destruction’ which is not-different prom the thing itself; as the positive thing is produced from its own cause 
na ca anaṃśe samudbhūte bhāva ātmani ātma hetutaḥ | tadā ātmā eva vināśaḥ anyaiḥ ādhātum pāryate punar || 	When a certain thing that comes out of its cause is without parts,—the ‘destruction’ that would be imposed upon it by other causes must be of the same nature

nāśa nāmnā padārthena bhāvaḥ nāśyate iti asat | anya tva ādi vikalpānām tatra api artha anuvṛttitaḥ || 	It is not true to assert that “the thing is destroyed by another thing named ‘destruction’”,—because the arguments based upon the alternatives of its being ‘different’ or ‘non-different’ and so forth are applicable, by implication, to such an assertion also 
bhāva abhāva ātmakaḥ nāśaḥ pradhvaṃsa apara saṃjñakaḥ | kriyate ced na tasya api karaṇam yukti saṃgatam || abhāvasya ca kārya tve vastu tā eva aṅkura ādi vat | prasakta ajanya rūpasya hetu śaktyā samudbhavāt || 	If it be held that—“the ‘destruction’ (‘nāśa’) brought about is of the nature of the ‘negation of entity otherwise called ‘disruption’ (pradhvaṃsa’),—there can be no reasonable cause for that also.—If negation were an effect, then it would be an entity, like the sprout and other effects; because while there is possibility of its being regarded as something ‘not-produced’, it is found to come about through the potency of a cause 
vidhinā evam abhāvaḥ ca paryudāsa āśrayāt kṛtaḥ | yaḥ tatra vyatireka ādi vikalpaḥ vartate punar || 	The view that ‘negation’ is brought by an ‘affirmation’ has been sought to be supported by haying recourse to ‘preclusion’ (as the form of the negation so brought about);—but the argument based upon the alternatives possible regarding difference or non-difference, all become applicable to this view 
atha kriyā niṣedhaḥ ayam bhāvam na eva karoti hi | tathā api ahetu tā siddhā kartuḥ hetu tva hānitaḥ || 	If it be held that “what is meant by ‘destruction’ is the negation of effective action, and this does not bring about a positive entity”,—even so, it becomes established that what brings about the destruction cannot be its ‘cause—because it is devoid of the character of ‘cause’ 
nanu na eva vināśaḥ ayam sattā kāle asti vastunaḥ  | na pūrvam na cirāt paścāt vastunaḥ anantaram tu asau || evam ca hetumān eṣa yuktaḥ niyata kālataḥ | kādācitka tva yogaḥ hi nirapekṣe nirākṛtaḥ || 	This destruction of the thing is not present at the time that the thing is in existence; nor is it present before (the thing has come into existence); nor very long after (the thing has come into existence), in fact, it comes immediately after (the thing has come into existence); thus, inasmuch as it comes into existence only at a particular time, it must have a cause. If it were independent (of all causes), then this occasional character would be impossible, as shown before 
vastu anantara bhāvāt ca hetumān eva yujyate | a bhūtvā abhāvataḥ ca api yathā eva anyaḥ kṣaṇaḥ mataḥ || 	As it comes immediately after the thing, the destruction must have a cause; also because, not having been in existence, it comes into existence,—just like the following moment.”

tat atra katamam nāśam pare paryanuyuñjate | kim kṣaṇa sthiti dharmāṇam bhāvam eva tathā uditam || atha bhāva svarūpasya nivṛttim dhvaṃsa saṃjñitām | pūrva paryunuyoge hi nā eva kiñcid virudhyate || 	What sort of ‘destruction’ is it (the causelessness of) which the other people object to? (a) Is it the ‘momentary existence’ of things, as explained by us? Or the ‘cessation of the form of the entity’, called ‘disruption’ (dhvaṃsa, annihilation)?—If it is the former, then there is no quarrel 
yaḥ hi bhāvaḥ kṣaṇa sthāyī vināśaḥ iti gīyate | tam hetumantam icchāmaḥ parābhāvāt tu ahetukam || 	That thing which, having a momentary existence, is called ‘destruction’,—this destruction we also admit as having a muse; it is only the other kind of destruction which we regard as without cause, on the ground of there being nothing else (which could be its cause) 
vastu anantara bhāvi tvam na tatra tu asti tādṛśi | cala bhāva svarūpasya bhāvena eva saha udayāt || 	The character of ‘coming immediately after the thing’ does not subsist in the destruction as described; because the destruction in the form of the mobile (momentary) thing appears along with the thing itself 
atas vināśa sadbhāvāt na nityāḥ sarva saṃskṛtāḥ  | na vināśīti buddhiḥ ca nirnimittā prasajyate || 	Thus then, the destruction being there, things cannot be eternal; and the notion that ‘things are destructible’ cannot be baseless 
pradhvaṃsasya tu nairātmyāt na asti anantara bhāvi tā | na a bhūtvā abhāva yogasya gagana indīvara ādi vat || 	As regards ‘annihilation’, as it can have no essence (character), it cannot ‘come into existence immediately after the thing’;—and as regards the presence of the character of ‘coming into existence after having not existed before’, this is precisely like the ‘sky-lotus’ and other things 
pradhvaṃsaḥ bhavati iti eva na bhāvaḥ bhavati iti ayam | arthaḥ pratyāyyate tu atra na vidhiḥ kasyacid mataḥ || 	When it is said that ‘there is annihilation of the thing’, what is meant is that ‘the thing is not there’, and it is not meant to convey the affirmation (predication) of any thing 
na hi bāleyaḥ iti evat nāma mātre kṛte kvacid  | sarvaḥ rāsabha dharmaḥ asmin prasaktim labhate nare || 	The mere naming of a person as ‘donkey’ does not lead to the attribution of the whole character of the ass to that person 
dhvaṃsa nāmnaḥ padārthasya vidhāne punar asya na | vastunaḥ jāyate kiñcid iti etat kim nivarttate || 	If the category named ‘annihilation’ were affirmed in reference to a thing, there being nothing actually produced in the thing,—how is it that the thing ceases (to exist)? 
bhāva dhvaṃsa ātmanaḥ ca evam nāśasya asattvam iṣyate | vastu rūpa viyogena na bhāva abhāva rūpataḥ || 	Thus it is that the existence of any ‘destruction of things’ of the nature of ‘annihilation’ is not admitted; because the ‘destruction of a thing’ consists in the dissociation of a particular form, and not in the negation of its existence 
nivṛtti rūpa tā api asmin vidhinā na abhidhīyate | vastu rūpa anuvṛttiḥ ca kṣaṇāt ūrdhvam niṣidhyate || atas vyavasthitam rūpam vihitam na asya kiṃcana | iti nitya vikalpaḥ asmin kriyamāṇaḥ nirāspadaḥ || 	When it is asserted that ‘destruction is of the nature of cessation’, it does not mean the affirmation of its positive character; it only denies the continuity of the particular form of the thing beyond one moment. thus no lasting form is affirmed in regard to the ‘annihilation’, and there is no room for the alternative that it is eternal 
ye tu vyoma ādayaḥ bhāvāḥ akṛta tvena saṃmatāḥ | vastu vṛttyā na santi eva te ca śakti viyogataḥ || kṣaṇika akṣaṇika tva ādi vikalpaḥ teṣu anāspadaḥ | tadā vastu eva yena syāt kṣaṇikam yat iva anyathā  || 	The ākāśa and other things which have been held to be ‘uncreated’ are really non-existent, in the form of ‘entities’; as they are devoid of all potentiality; hence there can be no room for attributing to them any such alternative characters as that of ‘momentariness’ or ‘non-momentariness’; whereby they could be regarded even as an ‘entity’—be it either momentary or otherwise 
kṣaṇa avasthita rūpam hi vastu kṣaṇikam ucyate | sthira rūpa samākrāntam vastu eva akṣaṇikam punar || 	That thing is said to be ‘momentary’ whose form persists for a moment; while that thing is said to be ‘non-momentary’ which is endowed with a lasting (permanent) form 
utpāda anantara asthāyi svarūpam yat ca vastunaḥ  | tat ucyateḥ kṣaṇaḥ saḥ asti yasya tat kṣaṇikam matam || 	That form of the thing which does not persist after its production is what is called ‘kṣaṇa’, ‘moment’; and that which has this form is held to be ‘kṣaṇika’, ‘momentary 
asati api artha bhede ca saḥ asti asya iti na bādhyate | icchā racita saṅketa mātra bhāvi hi vācakam || 	Even when there is no difference between two things, there is nothing to prevent the notion of ‘this belonging to that’; as every expressive word is applied in accordance with an arbitrary whim 
udaya anantara āsthāyi vastu evam tu vivakṣitam | tatra sa pratyayaḥ śabdaḥ apratyayaḥ vā prayujyatām || 	What is meant to be spoken of (by the term ‘kṣaṇika’, ‘momentary’) is the thing that does not continue to exist after its coming into existence; and that term may be used either with the affix or without the affix (to which Uddyotaka has taken objection). 
yadi tu vyoma kāla ādyāḥ santaḥ syuḥ te tathā asati | na atikrāmanti te api enam kṣaṇabhaṅgam kṛtāḥ iva || 	If ākāśa, time and such things are existent, then, being so, they cannot escape from being momentary,—just like the created things 
tathā hi santaḥ ye nāma te sarve kṣaṇabhaṅginaḥ | tat yathā saṃskṛtāḥ bhāvāḥ tathā asiddhāḥ anantaram || santaḥ ca amī tvayā iṣyante vyoma kāleśvara ādayaḥ | kṣaṇika tva viyoge tu na sat teṣām prasajyate || krameṇa yugapad ca api yasmāt artha kriyā kṛtaḥ | na bhavanti sthirāḥ bhāvāḥ niḥsatvāḥ te tatas matāḥ 	For instance, whatever things are existent are all in a state of perpetual flux,—just as all created things have just been shown to be;—these things, ākāśa, time, god, and the rest are held by you to be existent;—these could never have an existence if they were devoid op momentariness;—because permanent things cannot have any fruitful activity, either successively or simultaneously,—therefore they are held to be non-existent 
kāryāṇi hi vilambante kāraṇa asaṃnidhānataḥ | samartha hetu sadbhāve kṣepaḥ teṣām hi kiṅkṛtaḥ || 	Effects are delayed on account of the non-proximity of the cause. if the efficient cause were there, to what would that delay be due? 
atha api santi nityasya kramiṇaḥ sahakāriṇaḥ | yān apekṣya karoti eṣa kārya grāmam krama āśrayam || 	Even of the eternal thing, there are certain auxiliaries,—on account of whose help, the former brings about the large number of its effects, in succession” 
sādhu etat kiṃtu te tasya bhavanti sahakāriṇaḥ | kim yogya rūpa hetu tvāt eka artha karaṇena vā || yogya rūpasya hetu tve sa bhāvaḥ taiḥ kṛtaḥ bhavet | sa ca aśakya kriyaḥ yasmāt tad svarūpam tadā sthitam  || kṛtau vā tad svarūpasya nitya tā asya avahīyate | vibhinnaḥ atiśayaḥ tasmāt yadi asau kārakaḥ katham || 	This is all very well; but when those other things become its ‘auxiliaries’, is it because they are the cause of the causal efficiency (of the permanent thing)? Or because they also serve the same purpose?—If they are the cause of the causal efficiency (of the permanent thing),—then this thing itself would be produced by them; and yet this is incapable of being produced, as it is always there (being permanent). Or, if the very form of the permanent thing were held to be produced (by the auxiliaries), then its eternality (permanence) disappears. If the ‘peculiarity’ (produced in the permanent thing) be regarded as something distinct from the thing itself, then,—how can this (thing) be regarded as the ‘cause’? 
tasmin sati hi kāryāṇām utpādaḥ tad abhāvataḥ | anutpādāt saḥ eva evam hetu tvena vyavasthitaḥ || 	The effects would in that case be produced only when the said ‘condition’ is there,—and they would not be produced when the ‘condition’ is not there and thus it would be this ‘condition’ that would have to be regarded as their cause 
atha api tena sambandhāt tasya api asti eva hetu tā  | kaḥ sambandhaḥ tayoḥ iṣṭaḥ tādātmayam na vibhedataḥ  || na ca tasya tad utpattiḥ yaugapadya prasaṅgataḥ | tatas ca yaugapadyena kāryāṇām udayaḥ bhavet || 	It might be argued that—“On account of its (the condition’s) relation to the thing, the causal character does belong to that (thing) also”.—What ‘relation’ can be held to subsist between these two?—It cannot be identity; as the two are recognised as distinct. nor can the relation be held to consist in the fact that it is produced from it; as in that case, there should be simultaneity; and then the appearance of the effects also would be simultaneous 
tatra api anya vyapekṣāyām anavasthā prasajyate | ekadā api tatas kāryam na asambandhāt prakalpyate || 	If it be held that there is need for a further auxiliary,—then there would be an infinite regress. from this it follows that, on account of the absence of relation, the effect cannot be produced even once 
sambandhaḥ samavāyaḥ ced tatra api evam vicintyate | upakārībhavan tasya samavāyī iṣyate sa kim || na vā tathā iti prathamaḥ vikalpaḥ yadi gṛhyate | sā eva prāptā tad utpattiḥ vyapāstā sā api anantaram || 	If the relation between the two (the permanent thing and the conditions) were held to be that of ‘inherence’ (subsistence), then also the following has got to be considered:—Is the ‘inherent’ thing so regarded because it is helpful? Or not so? If the former alternative is accepted, then it comes to be the same as the relation of ‘being produced from it’, and this has just been rejected 
anye api sarva bhāvāḥ syuḥ tathā eva samavāyinaḥ | aviśeṣāt na tasya ayam upakārī mataḥ yadi || 	In case the ‘inherent’ be not something helpful to that wherein it inheres, then all things would be equally inherent, as there could be nothing to differentiate one from the other 
bheda abheda vikalpasya pratyekam pratiṣedhanāt | dvi rūpaḥ atiśayaḥ tasya vyastaḥ bhavati vastunaḥ || 	Each of the two alternatives—that the two are different and non-different—having thus been severally rejected, the idea that the condition is both (different and non-different) also becomes discarded 
pudgala ādi parīkṣāsu dvairāśya pratiṣedhanāt | dvi rūpaḥ atiśayaḥ na asti na vā api anubhaya ātmakaḥ || 	In course of the examination of the ‘pudgala’, etc. it has been explained that both alternatives cannot be accepted. hence the ‘condition’ cannot be both ‘different’ and ‘non-different’; nor can it be neither ‘different’ nor ‘non-different 
atha na apekṣate nityaḥ pratyayān sahakāriṇaḥ | tathā api tad viyuktaḥ ayam kārakaḥ na antya hetu vat || nijaḥ tasya svabhāvaḥ ayam teṣām eva hi sannidhau | kāraka tvam atas kāryam tad bhāve api na sarvadā || 	Even though the permanent thing may not actually need the auxiliary agencies, yet, apart from these latter, it cannot produce its effect, like the final cause; its own nature is such that it becomes an efficient cause only when in close proximity to the auxiliaries; hence it is that even though the permanent thing is always present, its effect does not come about always.” 
astu evam kintu sākalye yā tasya prakṛtiḥ matā  | vaikalye sā eva ced iṣṭā nityāḥ syuḥ sahakāriṇaḥ || 	This may be so; but if the character of the permanent thing in its complete form (along with its auxiliaries) be held to be the same as that of it in its incomplete form (without the auxiliaries), then the auxiliaries also should be permanent (eternal) 
tad sambaddha svabhāvasya bhāve teṣām api sthiteḥ | anyat ced vikalam rūpam eka tvam avahīyate || vyapekṣayā api atas ca evam na kāryāṇām krama udayaḥ | yaugapadyam ca na eva iṣṭam tad kāryāṇām krama īkṣaṇāt || 	Because they must exist while that thing exists whose character is connected with them.—If, on the other hand, the incomplete form be held to be different (from the complete form), then the unity of the thing becomes lost.—Thus the successive appearance of effects is not possible, even when the cause is dependent (upon auxiliaries) 
niḥśeṣāṇi ca kāryāṇi sakṛt kṛtvā nivarttate | sāmarthya ātmā sa ced ārthaḥ siddhā asya kṣaṇabhaṅgi tā || 	412-413) As for simultaneity, that is not favoured (by the other party at all); as the effects are actually found to appear in succession If the thing possessed of the causal potency disappears, after having brought about all its effects simultaneously,—then its momentariness becomes established 
tad rūpasya anuvṛttau tu kāryam utpādayet punar | akiñcitkara rūpasya sāmarthyam ca iṣyate katham || sarva sāmarthya śūnya tvāt tārā patha saroja vat | asantaḥ akṣaṇikāḥ sarve śaktiḥ yat vastu lakṣaṇam || 	If, on the other hand, the form of the efficient cause continues (after having brought about the effects), then it should produce the effect over again; because, how could any efficiency be attributed to what is not effective in bringing about due effects? Thus all things would be non-existent and momentary,—like the ‘sky-lotus’,—on account of their being devoid of all efficiency; because—it is efficiency (for effective action) that constitutes the characteristic of (existing) ‘things’ 
atha na aṅagīkriyeta idam vastu tvam śakti lakṣaṇam | yedavam anyat nirdiśyam vastūnām lakṣaṇam paraiḥ || 	If, then, capacity (for fruitful action) be not admitted to be the characteristic feature of the ‘entity’,—then, under the circumstances, it behoves the other party to point out some other characteristic feature of ‘entities’ 
sattā sambandhaḥ iṣṭaḥ ced vastūnām lakṣaṇam na tat | asiddhyāḥ samavāya ādeḥ katham vā anyaḥ anya lakṣaṇam || 	If the characteristic feature of ‘entities’ be held to consist in being related to existence (being),—that cannot be right; because no such relation as that of ‘inherence’ and the like is known to subsist between them. how too could they be the characteristic feature of one another? 
sarvaḥ ca artha vicāra ādi vyāpāraḥ artha kriyā arthinaḥ | nirākula dhiyaḥ yuktaḥ na unmattaka tayā punar || tat na yat nāma keṣāñcid kathañcid upayujyate  | kvacid kadācid tatra eva yuktā sattā vyavasthitiḥ || tad rūpasya eva ca arthasya kṣaṇika tvam prasādhyate  | vyāptiḥ sarva upasaṃhārā tasmin eva abhidhīyate || 	All operations bearing upon the consideration of things are to be carried on by one who has an undisturbed intellect and seeks to accomplish a useful purpose,—not by one who is demented. hence it would be right to determine the existence of only such a thing as would be of use to some people, at some place, at some time and in some way. it is in reference to such a thing that we are proving the momentariness; and it is only with reference to such things that the universal premiss has been asserted 
niḥśeṣa śakti śūnyam tu yat vandhyā suta saṃnibham  | sarvajña cetasaḥ api eti hetu tvam na kadācana  || kriyate tatra na eva idam kārya rūpa ādi adṛṣṭitaḥ  | nirnibandhana mastitva vyavasthānam vicakṣaṇaiḥ  || na tasmin sādhitena arthaḥ kṣaṇika tvena kaścana  | tatra paryanuyogaḥ ca kriyamāṇaḥ api niṣphalaḥ || 	That which is devoid of all capacity, and is like ‘the son of the barren woman’, never becomes a cause (basis) even for the mind of the omniscient person. and as in such a thing, intelligent men do not perceive an effect or character and so forth, they do not seek to establish its existence; as any such attempt would be absolutely baseless. there can be no useful purpose served by proving the momentariness of such a thing. so that any objection taken to this is also absolutely futile 
nanu ca artha kriyā śaktāḥ nabhaḥ tāmarasa ādayaḥ | sva jñāna hetu bhāvena na ca ete santi bhāvikāḥ || 	Such things as the sky-lotus are found to be capable of fruitful activity, in so far as they serve as the cause of their own cognition; and yet these are not existent.” 
nirālambanam eva idam ambara ambhoruha ādiṣu | tad jalpa vāsanā mātra bhāvi jñānam pravarttate || 	The character in question as attributed to the ‘sky-lotus’ is entirely baseless; its idea is there only as the result of one’s eagerness for wrangling 
abhāva kāraṇa tve tu nairantaryeṇa saṃbhavet | na abhāvaḥ apekṣate kiñcid nirviśeṣa tayā sadā || 	If the said idea had a non-entity for its cause, then it would be produced constantly; as the non-entity cannot need anything else, being always devoid of distinctions 
kṣaṇikeṣu api bhāveṣu nanu ca arthakriyā katham | viśeṣa adhāyinaḥ anyonyam na hi ādyāḥ sahakāriṇaḥ  || jātau sarva ātmanā siddheḥ ajātau vastu abhāvataḥ  | nirviśeṣāt viśeṣasya bhāve kāryam na kim bhavet || na ca anyatas viśiṣṭāḥ te tulya paryanuyogataḥ  | sahakāri kalāpānām anavasthā ca te bhaveta || krameṇa yugapad ca api yatas te arthakriyākṛtaḥ  | na bhavanti tatas teṣām vyarthaḥ kṣaṇika tā āśrayāḥ 	Even if things are momentary,—how can there re any effective action? The initial auxiliaries could not be productive of peculiarities in one another; because if they have come into existence, they must be there already in their complete form; if they have not come into existence, as the entities would not be there, as this absence would be without differentiation, wherefore could not the effect itself be produced therefrom (for the bringing about of which the auxiliaries are posited)? Specially as they could not be differentiated from anything else, being equally open to question. Thus too there would be an infinite regress of auxiliaries for you.—Then again, as they could not have an effective action either successively or simultaneously, it is useless to regard them as ‘momentary’; specially when no peculiarity can be brought about by any auxiliaries, the entire series is rightly held to be wholly undifferentiated (uniform). If then the destruction were without cause, it should come about at the very beginning; and if there be no possibility of it at the beginning, how could it come at the end also?—If again, no cause is admitted except the cause of the entities themselves,—then why should there be any incongruity in their destruction coming about in certain cases only (not always)?” 
ucyate prathama avasthā na eva anyonya upakāriṇaḥ | eka artha kriyayā tu ete bhavanti saha akāriṇaḥ || anyonya anupakāre api na aviśiṣṭāḥ ime yatas | sva upādāna bala udbhūtāḥ kalāpa utpādakaḥ pṛthak || 	Our answer to the above is as follows:—There can be no mutual help in the case of things appearing at the ‘initial stage’; they become auxiliaries only by virtue of having the same effective action. even when there is no help rendered to one another, these are not entirely undifferentiated; because when they are themselves produced out of their own constituent cause, they become productive of their own several distinct ‘series’ 
tatas prabhṛti ye jātāḥ viśeṣāḥ te tu tad kṛtāḥ  | tad rūpa prakṛti tvena teṣām tad upayoginām || 	Thenceforward the particular entities that come into existence are brought about by that; on account of the fact that those that help towards them are of that nature 
niyata acintya śaktīni vastūni iha pratikṣaṇam | bhavanti na anuyojyāni dahane dāha śakti vat || 	Every moment, entities go on coming into existence, with definite undefinable potentialities, and no objection can be taken to them,—just as to the fire’s capacity to burn 
santāna uccheda rūpaḥ tu vināśaḥ yaḥ na hetumān | tasya ante api na bhāvaḥ asti tathā janma tu vāryate || vilakṣaṇa kapāla ādeḥ utpādaḥ tu sa hetukaḥ | saḥ api ādau jāyate na eva tadā hetoḥ asambhavāt || 	It is ‘destruction’ in the shape of the ‘breaking up of the series’ which is without cause; and this does not come about even at the end;—what is denied is its coming into existence in that form. As for the coming into existence of such dissimilar things (series) as the potsherd and the like,—this certainly has a cause; but this also is not produced at the beginning, because at that time its cause is not there 
dvividhāḥ kṣaṇikāḥ bhāvāḥ kecid hrāsasya hetavaḥ | śīta ādeḥ eva vahni ādyāḥ apare na tathāvidhāḥ || adṛṣṭa tattvaḥ lokaḥ tu virodham abhimanyate | kārya kāraṇa bhāve api prathama ukteṣu anekadhā || bādhya bādhaka bhāvaḥ tu vastunaḥ na eva tāttvikaḥ  | vidyate tatas eva uktam virodha gatiḥ iti api || 	There are two kinds of ‘momentary things’—some are causes of decadence,—e.g. fire is the cause of the decadence (diminution) of cold; and others are not so.—People, not perceiving the truth, think that there is antagonism of various kinds among things, even when the relation of cause and effect is there, as a matter of fact however there is no real ‘antagonism’ among things, in the shape of the relation of the destroyer and destroyed. It is in this sense that the expression ‘notion of antagonism’ has been used 
nanu ca pratyabhijñānam saḥ eva iti upajāyate | akṣa vyāpāra sadbhāve niṣprakampa bādhitam || tatas pratyakṣa bādhā iyam durvārā sarva hetuṣu | kṣaṇabhaṅga prasiddhi artham upātteṣu prasajyate || 	As a matter of fact, there is always the recognition of a thing in the form ‘this is that same’, when the sense-organ concerned is rightly functioning; and this recognition is quite firm and undeniable.—This therefore is an irrepressible fact of perception, which annuls all the reasons that have been adduced for proving the ‘perpetual flux’ of things.” 
na khalu pratyabhijñānam pratyakṣam upapadyate | vastu rūpam anirdeśyam sa abhilāpam ca tat yatas || bhrāntam ca pratyabhijñānam pratyakṣam tat vilakṣaṇam | abheda adhyavasāyena bhinna rūpe api vṛttitaḥ || 	In fact, recognition can never be of the nature of direct sense-perception; because the form of the thing itself is inexpressible, and the recognition is expressed in words.—Recognition must be wrong, and sense-perception is entirely different from it. That recognition is wrong is clear from the fact that it appears in the form of the notion of ‘non-difference’ where, in reality, there is difference 
pūrvam saṃvihita ākāra gocaram ced idam bhavet | jāyeta pūrvam eva idam tādarthyāt pūrva buddhi vat || 	If the recognition did apprehend the form of the thing as previously cognised, then it would have appeared at that same time, as its object would be the same,—like the previous cognition 
na ca evam tena na eva idam tad artha grāhakam matam  | tad jñāna kāle utpādāt viṣaya antara buddhi vat || abheda adhyavasāyena bhinna rūpe api vṛttitaḥ | māyā golaka vijñānam iva bhrāntam idam sthitam  || 	As a matter of fact, however it is not so; then the recognition has not been regarded as apprehending the same object;—because it is produced at its own time,—like the cognition of another thing; and inasmuch as it apprehends as non-different what is really different, it must be mistaken,—like the notion of the illusory ball 
niṣpādita kriye ca arthe pravṛtteḥ smaraṇa ādi vat | na pramāṇam idam yuktam karaṇa artha vihānitaḥ || 	It cannot be right to regard recognition as valid,—because it operates towards an object whose purpose has been already accomplished,—like remembrance and such other cognitions;—and hence it is devoid of the character of the valid means (of cognition) 
idānīntana mastitvam na hi pūrva dhiyā gatam | tat asti asya viśeṣaḥ ced smaraṇe yaḥ na vidyate || pūrva pramita mātre hi jāyate saḥ iti smṛtiḥ | saḥ eva ayam iti iyam tu pratyabhijñā atirekiṇī || 	As a matter of fact, the existence of the thing at the present time (of recognition) has not been included under the previous cognition; this is a peculiar feature in recognition, which is not present in remembrance. Remembrance is in the form of ‘that’ and appertains only to that which has been already cognised before; recognition however is in the form ‘this is that same’, which is something totally different (from the previous cognition).” 
jñāte ca avidyamāna tva ādyau saṃśaya viparyayau | bādhitvā tau labheta eva pratyabhijñā pramāṇa tām || 	Inasmuch as there is no doubt or mistake in regard to what is cognised (by recognition),—recognition acquires the character of the ‘means of right cognition’ after having set aside both.” 
vijñātaḥ api itaraiḥ arthaḥ pratyakṣeṇa anyathā bhavet | pratyakṣeṇa avaruddhe tu na itara utpatti saṃbhavaḥ || 	A thing, though cognised by other means of cognition, could be accepted as otherwise, if so apprehended by sense-perception; when however a thing is already taken up by sense-perception, there can be no appearance of any other means of cognition (to the contrary).” 
kaḥ hi jyeṣṭha pramāṇena dṛḍhena arthe avadhārite | durbalaiḥ itaraiḥ paścāt adhyavasyet viparyayam || 	When a thing has been duly apprehended through the firmly established highest means of cognition,—how could one ever have a cognition to the contrary, on the strength of the other weaker means of cognition?” 
nanu idānīnta nāstitvam yadi bhinnam tvayā iṣyate | pūrva bhāvāt tadā bhedaḥ tvayā eva pratipāditaḥ || 	If existence at the present time is held by you to be distinct from the previous existence, then difference between them becomes proved by yourself 
ananya tve api sattvasya katham pūrva dhiyā agatam | tasya āgatau hi vastu eva na upalabdham prasajyate || 	If the present existence is not-different (from the previous existence),—then how is it that it is ‘not included in the previous cognition’? In fact, if it were not included therein, then it would come to this that the thing itself was not apprehended at all 
pratyakṣeṇa ca bādhāyām anumāna ādi gocare | na anumāna ādi mānam syāt bādhātaḥ taimira ādi vat || 	If what has been cognised through inference and the other means of cognition were annulled by sense-perception, then inference and the rest could not be regarded as means of right cognition,—because they are annulled,—like cognitions through defective vision 
artha saṃvādaka tve ca samāne dveṣya tā asya kā | tad abhāve tu na eva syāt pramāṇam anumā ādikam || 	The character of ‘being in accordance with the real state of things’ being equally present in all forms of valid cognition,—why should there be a prejudice at all?—In case the said character be not present in inference and the rest, then these latter would not be valid means of right cognition at all 
nanu anena anumānena bādhyate sarva hetuṣu | vyāptiḥ sarva upasaṃhārā pratijñā arthasya vā kṣatiḥ || 	The all-comprehensive invariable concomitance (premiss) that has been asserted in all the reasonings (propounded by the buddhist) becomes annulled by the following inference; or else, the proposition (asserting the doctrine in question) itself becomes rejected.” 
vivakṣita arka candra ādi viṣayam yat pravarttate | jñānam tad kāla sambaddha sūrya ādi viṣayam param || pārthiva aviṣaya tve hi tad jñāna tva abhidhānataḥ | tat yathā prathamam jñānam tad kāla arka ādi gocaram || 	The subsequent cognition of the sun and other things must appertain to the same sun and other things that exist at the time of the cognition that appears in connection with the sun and moon, etc.,—because while it is not a cognition of anything related to the earth and other things, it is spoken of as the cognition of those things (sun, etc,),—just like the previous cognition of the sun at that time.” 
rūpa tva ādi āśrayāḥ sarve ye ca teṣām samāśrayāḥ | ye ca tad viṣayāḥ kecid jāyante pratyayāḥ tathā || utpāda anantaram dhvaṃsa bhājaḥ na eva bhavanti te  | prameya tva abhidheya tva hetutaḥ kha aravinda vat || 	All those things that are the substrata of colour, etc.,—and the substrata of these things,—as also the cognitions that appear in regard to these,—all these are not, like the sky-lotus, liable to destruction immediately on coming into existence,—because they are cognisable and expressible.”

sādhyena vikalam tāvat ādye hetau nidarśanam | hetu tvāt viṣayaḥ sarvaḥ na hi sva jñāna kālikaḥ || 	In the first reasoning, the corroborative instance is devoid of the probandum, as it is all included under the probans; and all objects of cognition are not always synchronous with their cognition 
yadā sūrya ādi śabdāḥ ca vivakṣā mātra bhāvinaḥ | dīpa ādau viniveśyante tad jñānaiḥ vyabhicāri tā || 	When terms like ‘sun’ and the rest, whose use depends upon the speaker’s whim, are applied to the lamp and such things,—the cognition of the sun that appears proves the falsity of the reason in question 
jāti ādeḥ niḥsvabhāva tvāt na eva iṣṭā kṣaṇabhaṅgi tā 	Things like the ‘universal’ have no character at all (being non-existent),—hence the ‘momentariness’ of such things cannot be postulated by anyone; so that any reasons adduced for the proving of the absence of ‘momentariness’ in the said things is entirely futile 
samāna śabda vācya tvam dīpa ādi pratyayeṣu api | vartate vyabhicārī eṣa hetuḥ tena bhavati atas || 	As regards the character of ‘being expressed by the same term’—this is present in the cognitions of things like the lamp also. Hence this reason becomes ‘inconclusive’ 
sāmānādhikaraṇyam ced bādhittam teṣu kalpyate | vivakṣite api vispaṣṭā bādhā eṣā kim na vīkṣyate || 	If it be held that “in the case of the cognitions of the lamp, the ‘co-extensiveness’ is subsequently annulled”,—then how is it that you do not perceive the clear annulment of the same in your proposed conclusion also? 
vivāda padam ārūḍhāḥ na eka artha viṣayāḥ dhiyaḥ  | krameṇa utpadyamāna tvāt vidyut dīpa ādi buddhi vat || krama bhāva virodhaḥ hi jñāneṣu eka artha bhāviṣu | anyaiḥ akārya bhedasya tad apekṣā virodhataḥ || 	The cognitions under dispute cannot pertain to one and the same thing, because they appear in succession,—like the cognitions pertaining to lightning, lamp and such things.—In all cognitions pertaining to one and the same thing, the presence of succession is incompatible. and when the effect is the same, even the dependence of other things would be incongruous 
sandigdha vyatireki tvam sarveṣu eteṣu hetuṣu | vipakṣe vartamānānām bādhaka anupadarśanāt || 	All these reasons are free from doubt and denial;—as no proofs have been adduced in annulment of these 
sandigdha vyatireki tvam sarveṣu eteṣu hetuṣu | vipakṣe vartamānānām bādhaka anupadarśanāt || 	All these reasons are free from doubt and denial;—as no proofs have been adduced in annulment of these 
kṣaṇika anitya tā līḍham sarvam ced vastu tat katham | karma tad phala sambandha kārya kāraṇa tā ādayaḥ || 	If all things are obsessed by non-permanence, in the form of ‘momentariness’, then how can there be any relation between action and its result (reaction), or between the cause and its effect and so forth?” 
kṣaṇika anitya tā līḍham sarvam ced vastu tat katham | karma tad phala sambandha kārya kāraṇa tā ādayaḥ || 	If all things are obsessed by non-permanence, in the form of ‘momentariness’, then how can there be any relation between action and its result (reaction), or between the cause and its effect and so forth?”

nairātmya vāda pakṣe tu pūrvam eva avabudhyate | mad vināśāt phalam na syāt mattaḥ nyasya api vā bhavet || iti nā eva pravartteta prekṣāvān phala lipsayā | śubha aśubha kriyā ārambhe dūratas tu phalam sthitam || 	As a matter of fact, under the doctrine of ‘no-soul’, the doer of an act would know, beforehand, that, ‘as i am going to perish immediately, there would be no result from this act, or it would come to some one other than myself’; and knowing this, the intelligent man would not undertake the performance of any act, good or bad, for the purpose of securing its result; as for the result, it would be still further removed.” 
na a nāgataḥ na vā atītaḥ bhāvaḥ kārya kriyā kṣamaḥ  | vartamānaḥ api tāvantam kālam na eva avatiṣṭhate || 	Neither the future nor the past entity can be capable of producing the effect; as for the present one, that also does not continue to exist till that time.”

nāśa utpāda sama tve api na eva apekṣā parasparam | na kārya kāraṇa tve staḥ tad vyāpāra ananugrahāt || 	Even if the destruction and production were simultaneous, there would not be mutual dependence; so that there could not be the relation of ‘cause and effect’, as there would be no help rendered by it.” 
jāyamānaḥ ca gandha ādiḥ ghaṭa rūpe vinaśyati | tat kāryam na iṣyate yadvat tathā rūpa antarāṇi api || 	The odour and other qualities that appear after the destruction of the colour of the jar are not held to be the effect of this latter; in the same way the subsequent colours also (could not be regarded as the effect of the previous colour).” 
tasmāt prāk kārya niṣpatteḥ vyāpāraḥ yasya dṛśyate | tat eva kāraṇam tasya na tu ānantarya mātrakam || 	Thus that alone can be regarded as the cause of an effect whose action is found to be there before the production of that effect; and not mere immediate sequence.”

kṣaṇa sthāyī ghaṭa ādiḥ ced na upalabhyeta cakṣuṣā | na hi naṣṭāḥ pratīyante cira atīta padārtha vat || kārya kāraṇa bhāvaḥ api pratyakṣa anupalambhataḥ | te pūrtinā eva eti siddhim bhāvānām svabhāva anupalambhanāt || 	If the jar and such things existed only for one moment, then they could not be perceived by the eye; as things that have been destroyed are never cognised,—as is found in the case op things long past.—The relation op ‘cause and effect’ cannot be apprehended by means op ‘perception and non-apprehension’, because the nature of things is not apprehended at all” 
kaḥ vā vyavasthitaḥ karttā saṃdhatte kramavat gatim | asya dṛṣṭau idam dṛṣṭam na asya adṛṣṭau tu lakṣyate || 	What permanent doer (agent) is there who would correlate the cognitions appearing in succession? If any such were seen, then alone what is desired could be admitted; and if any such is not seen, then this latter cannot be understood.” 
kṣaṇabhaṅgiṣu bhāveṣu pratyabhijñā ca durghaṭā | na hi anya nara dṛṣṭaḥ arthaḥ pratyabhijñāyate paraiḥ || 	Things are in ‘perpetual flux then recognition also is impossible; because what has been seen by one person cannot be ‘recognised’ by others.” 
sādṛśyāt pratyabhijñānam bhinne keśa ādike bhavet | jñātuḥ ekasya sadbhāvāt dvi bhede tu anibandhanam || pratisandhāna kārī ca yadi ekaḥ arthaḥ na vidyate | rūpe dṛṣṭe abhilāṣa ādiḥ tat katham syāt rasa ādiṣu || 	In the case of the hairs and other things, where there is difference, recognition may be due to similarity, because the perceiver is one and the same. when however there is difference of both, there would be no basis for recognition. if there is no single entity who could have the comprehensive notion, then how is it that, on seeing colour, there appears a longing for the taste and other qualities (of the thing seen)?” 
rāga ādi nigaḍaiḥ baddhaḥ kṣaṇaḥ anyaḥ bhava vārake | abaddhaḥ mucyate ca anyaḥ iti idam na avabudhyate || 	What is bound up with chains of attachment, etc. in the prison-house of the world is one ‘moment’, while the ‘moment’ that is liberated is another, who has not been in bondage;—this is incomprehensible.” 
mokṣaḥ na eva hi baddhasya kadācid api saṃbhavī | ekānta nāśataḥ tena vyarthaḥ mukti arthinām kṣaṇaḥ || 	For the bound (imprisoned) person, liberation can never be possible; because (ex hypothesi), he is absolutely destroyed. Hence all the effort put forth by persons seeking for liberation is futile.” 
mokṣam āsādayan dṛṣṭaḥ baddhaḥ sa nigaḍa ādibhiḥ | abaddhaḥ muktim eti iti dṛṣṭa avyāhatam īdṛśam || 	The person securing liberation has always been found to be one who has been bound up in chains, etc.; any such assertion therefore as that ‘the unbound person becomes liberated’ is contrary to a well-perceived fact.” 
eka adhikaraṇau etau bandha mokṣau tathā sthiteḥ | laukikau iva tau tena sarvam cārutaram sthitam || 	Bondage’ and ‘liberation’ must belong to the same person,—because they are of that nature,—like bondage and liberation in the ordinary world.—Thus everything becomes thoroughly well-established.” 
etena eva prakāreṇa smṛti ādīnām asambhavaḥ | eka adhikaraṇa abhāvāt kṣaṇa kṣayiṣu vastuṣu || 	In this same manner it may be shown that, if all things are in ‘perpetual flux’, remembrance and such other phenomena would be impossible,—as there would be no single substratum (under that theory).” 
atra abhidhīyate sarva kārya kāraṇa tā sthitau | satyām avyāhatāḥ ete sidhyanti evam nirātmasu || 	We proceed to answer the above criticisms as follows:—Things being without ‘soul’, in reference to these also, the relation of cause and effect being there, all the said notions become established without any difficulty 
yathā hi niyatā śaktiḥ bīja ādeḥ aṅkura ādiṣu | anvayi ātma viyoge api tathā eva ādhyātmike sthitiḥ || 	Just as the potency of the seed is restricted to the sprout even in the absence of a permanent ‘soul’,—so would it also be in the case of psychical concepts 
pāramparyeṇa sākṣāt vā kacit kiñcid hi śaktimat | tatas karma phala ādīnām sambandhaḥ upapadyate || 	Either indirectly or directly, it is only a certain thing,—and in only certain gases—that has the potentiality in regard to another thing; thus alone are such relations as that between actions and their results possible 
kartṛ tva ādi vyavasthā tu saṃtāna aikya vivakṣayā  | kalpanā āropitā eva iṣṭā na aṅgam sā tattva saṃsthiteḥ || 	The notion of the ‘doer’ and the rest is in reference to the unity of the ‘chain’; and that too is held to be only a figment of the imagination; it is not a fart of the real state of things 
anvaya asaṃbhave sā eva kārya kāraṇa tā bhavet | viśiṣṭā yujyate yadvat santāna antara bhāvibhiḥ || nanu bīja aṅkura ādīnām kārya kāraṇa tā īkṣyate | niyatā tatra sūkṣmaḥ api na aṃśaḥ asti anugama ātmakaḥ || 	In the absence of continuity, the relation of ‘cause and effect’ would be of the particular hind just pointed out,—this alone is possible among things appearing under different ‘chains’.—In the case of the seed, sprout and such things, the relation of cause and effect is found to be definitely certain, and yet there is not the slightest trace of continuity 
kṣiti ādīnām avaiśiṣṭye bīja aṅkura latā ādiṣu | na bhedaḥ yukta aikātmyāt tadā siddhā niranvayā  || tasmāt karma phala ādīnām bhāva abhāva prasiddhaye | kārya kāraṇa tā siddhau yatnaḥ kāryaḥ paraiḥ alam || 	If the elements of earth and the rest in the seed—sprout—creeper and so forth are not different,—then there can be no difference among them; as, in that case, all of them would be of the same nature. hence it must be admitted that there is no continuity in this case. For these reasons, for the purpose of establishing the existence of ‘action and re-action’, the superior philosophers should put forth an effort to prove the relation of ‘cause and effect’;—and for the purpose of establishing the non-existence of ‘action and reaction’, the other philosophers should put forth an effort to disprove the relation of ‘cause and effect’ 
atra ucyate dvitīye hi kṣaṇe kāryam prajāyate | prathame kāraṇam jātam avinaṣṭam tadā ca tat || kṣaṇika tvāt tu tad kārya kṣaṇa kāle na varttate | vṛttau vā viphalam kāryam nirvṛttam tat yatas tadā || 	Our explanation is as follows:—The effect gomes into existence at the second moment;—the cause had come into existence at the first moment; and during that moment it is not destroyed. but being momentary, it does not exist at the moment at which the effect is there; even if it were there, it would be useless, as the effect will have already come into existence 
na ca jātam puras tena śakyam janayitum punar | abhūta bhāva rūpa tvāt janmanaḥ na anyathā sthitiḥ || 	What has already come into existence cannot be produced by it over again; because what is meant by a thing ‘coming into existence’ is that there should comb about something that did not exist before. If it were not so, then there would be no resting at all 
tasmāt anaṣṭāt tad hetoḥ prathama kṣaṇa bhāvinaḥ  | kāryam utpadyate śaktāt dvitīya kṣaṇe eva tu  || vinaṣṭāt tu bhavet kāryam tṛtīya ādi kṣaṇe yadi | vipāka hetoḥ pradhvastāt yathā kāryam ca vakṣyate || yaugapadya prasaṅgaḥ api prathame yadi tat bhavet | sahabhū hetu vat tat ca na yuktyā yujyate punar || 	Thus we conclude that it is at the second moment that the effect comes into existence out of an efficient cause which came into existence at the first moment and has not yet been destroyed.—If it had been held that the effect comes into existence at the third moment, then it would come out of the destroyed cause; as the cause of the development will have been destroyed, like the effect itself,—as is going to be explained later on.—There would be simultaneity only if the effect had come at the first moment. but this cannot be right,—being just like the doctrine of the effects coming into existence along with the cause 
asataḥ prāk asāmarthyāt sāmārthye kārya saṃbhavāt | kārya kāraṇayoḥ spaṣṭam yaugapadyam virudhyate || 	What did not exist could have no potency;—if the potency were there, the effect would surely be produced; hence simultaneity between cause and effect is clearly incongruous 
na hi tat kāryam ātmīyam saṃdaṃśena iva kāraṇam | gṛhītvā janayati etat yaugapadyam yatas bhavet || na api gāḍham samāliṅgya prakṛtim jāyate phalam | kāmī iva dayitā yena sakṛdbhāvaḥ tayoḥ bhavet || 	As a matter of fact, when the cause produces its effect, it does hot do so by holding the effect in the manner of the pair of tongs,—by reason of which there would be simultaneity between the two, nor does the effect come into existence, by firmly embracing its cause, in the manner of the lover embracing the beloved,—by reason of which the two could be regarded as coming into existence at one and the same time 
niyamāt ātma hetu utthāt prathama kṣaṇa bhāvinaḥ  | yat yatas anantaram jātam dvitīya pakṣaṇa saṃnidhiḥ || tat tat janayati iti āhuḥ avyāpāre api vastuni | vivakṣā mātra saṃbhūta saṅketa anuvidhāyinaḥ || 	Though the thing is really inactive, yet on account of the restriction imposed by the nature of its cause which came into existence at the first moment, there appears, immediately afterwards, something coming into contact with the second moment; it is under these circumstances that the former is said to produce the latter;—such assertion being in accordance with a convention which is purely arbitrary, based upon the whim of the speaker 
janma atirikta kālena vyāpāreṇa atra kim phalam | sattā eva vyāpṛtiḥ tasyām satyām kārya udayaḥ yatas || 	What would be the good of any activity at any time other than that of its own birth? Mere existence is the only operation, as it is when this is there that the effect appears 
yaḥ ānantarya niyamaḥ sā eva apekṣā abhidhīyate | kārya udaye sadā bhāvaḥ vyāpāraḥ kāraṇasya ca || 	It is the necessary condition of ‘immediate sequence’ that is called ‘need’; and in the appearance of the effect, the only operation of the cause in all cases is its ‘existence’ 
tad bhāva bhāvitā mātrāt vyāpāraḥ pi avakalpitaḥ  | hetu tvam eti tadvān vā tat eva astu tatas varam || 	As a matter of fact, the operation also is assumed to be the cause only on the basis of the fact that the effect appears when the operation is there; it is far better, then, that the thing itself to which that operation belongs should be regarded as the cause 
bhāve sati hi dṛśyante bījāt eva aṅkura udayāḥ | na tu vyāpāra sadbhāve bhavat kiñcid samīkṣyate || 	As a matter of fact, it is on the existence of the seed itself that the sprout is seen to appear; on the other hand, nothing is seen as coming into existence on the existence of an ‘operation’ 
adṛṣṭa śakteḥ hetu tve kalpyamāne api na iṣyate | kim anyasya api hetu tvam viśeṣaḥ vā asya kaḥ tatas || 	If you assume the ‘causal character’ of the operation when its potency (towards the effect) has not been perceived,—then why do you not assume the same of something else also? Or, what distinguishing feature do you find in the ‘operation’ which is not found in that other thing? 
anyena ca vinā hetuḥ yathā vyāpāraḥ iṣyate | kāryasya vā bhavet tadvat kim anye api na hetavaḥ || 	Just as the ‘operation’, without any other (operation), is held to be the cause of the effect,—in the same way, why cannot others, like it, be causes? 
ā  |   |   |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 	is missing in the printed text; the commentary upon it however is available, as follows]:— 
dṛśya tva abhimatam na evam vayam ca upalabhāmahe | tat katham tasya sambandham aṅgīkurmaḥ nibandhanam || 	Though it has been regarded as perceptible, yet we do not perceive it; how then can we accept the connection op that as the basis (op the causal character)? 
buddheḥ yathā na janma eva pramāṇa tvam nirudhyate | tathā eva sarva bhāveṣu tad hetu tvam na kim matam || 	In the case of cognition, its coming into existence itself has been described as constituting its character of ‘means of right cognition’; why then should not the causal character in the case of all things be held to be the same? 
kṣaṇikā hi yathā buddhiḥ tathā eva anye api janminaḥ | sādhitāḥ tadvat eva atas nirvyāpāram idam jagat || 	Just as cognition is momentary, so are all things that are born, as they have been proved to be. Hence the whole universe must be devoid of ‘operation’ 
prabandha vṛttyā gandha ādeḥ iṣṭā eva anyonya hetu tā  | tad abādhakam eva idam tad hetu tva prasañjanam || 	As regards odour and other qualities (appearing in the jar), the fact of their being causes of each other, as forming factors of the same ‘chain’, is actually admitted (by us); and this idea is not annulled by the alleged anomaly of their being such causes 
anya anantara bhāve api kiñcid eva na kāraṇam | tathā eva niyama ādiṣṭam tulyam ca etat sthireṣu api || 	Even when one thing appears in immediate sequence to another,—it is only in some oases (not always) that the latter is the cause of the former, where the sequence is invariable; this is what is accepted, in view of such being the real state of things;—the same is the case under the view that things are permanent 
yaḥ yatra vyāpṛtaḥ kārye na hetuḥ tasya ced mataḥ | yasmin niyata sadbhāvaḥ yaḥ sa hetuḥ iti iṣyatām || 	If a thing that is active towards the producing of an effect is not to be regarded as the cause of this latter, [what then?]”—Then let that be accepted as the ‘cause’ of a thing whose presence is always essential for the appearance of this latter 
bhāva abhāvau imau siddhau pratyakṣa anupalambhataḥ  | yadi sa ākāra vijñāna vijñeyam vastu ced matam || yadā anākāra dhī vedyam vastu yuṣmābhiḥ iṣyate  | tad kṣaṇa tva ādi pakṣe api samānam upalabhyate  || pūrvakebhyaḥ sva hetubhyaḥ vijñānam sarvam eva hi | sama aṃśa kāla rūpa ādi bodha rūpam prajāyate 	As a matter of fact, the existence and non-existence (of things) are always known through perception and non-apprehension (respectively),—if the view held is that the things are apprehended by cognitions with forms.—If, on the other hand, you hold that the thing is apprehended by a cognition which is formless,—then the same is found to be the case under the doctrine of things being momentary. Because whenever cognition is produced by its antecedent causes, it is always in the form of an apprehension having the same colour, etc. that happen to appear at the time 
sa ākāre nanu vijñāne vaicitryam cetasaḥ bhavet | na ākāra anaṅkita tve asti pratyāsatti nibandhanam || 	If cognition has a form, then consciousness would be of variegated form. if, on the other hand, it is not marked by any form, there can be no basis in the form of proximity (for specifying the cognition).” 
bhavadbhiḥ api vaktavye tat asmin kiñcid uttare | yat ca atra vaḥ samādhānam asmākam api tat bhavet || 	You also have to supply some explanation in answer to the above; and whatever answer you put forward would also be our answer to it 
kṛta nāśaḥ bhavet evam kāṃrya na janayet yadi  | hetuḥ iṣṭam na ca evam yad prabandhe na asti hetu tā || akṛta abhyāgamaḥ api syāt yadi yena vinā kvacid  | jāyeta hetunā kāṃrya na etat niyata śaktitaḥ || 	There would be ‘waste of what is done’, only if the cause did not produce an effect no such view however is held by us, whereby there could be no ‘causal character’.—The ‘befalling of what is not done’ also would be there if an effect were produced without a cause; this also is not held by us; as the production of the effect is always dependent upon the potency of a particular cause 
kṣaṇa bheda vikalpena kṣaṇa nāśa ādi codyate | yat ca eva na eva aniṣṭam tu kiñcid āpāditam paraiḥ || 	What is urged against us, by setting forth the alternative of things being different every moment, is the fact of everything undergoing destruction at every moment and so forth. But by urging all this the other party have not put forward anything that is disagreeable to us 
ahīna sattva dṛṣṭīnām kṣaṇa bheda vikalpanā  | saṃtāna aikya abhimānena na kathañcid pravarttate || abhisaṃbuddha tattvāḥ tu pratikṣaṇa vināśinām | hetūnām niyamam buddhvā prārabhante śubhāḥ kriyāḥ || 	The assumptions based upon the difference among moments do not arise in persons the powers of whose vision have been damaged,—because of their idea of the unity of the ‘chain’. In fact, persons who have fully realised the truth understand the limitations of the causes appearing in a ‘perpetual flux’, and undertake the performance of good deeds accordingly 
keṣāñcid eva cittānām viśiṣṭā kārya kāryi tā | niyatā tena nirbādhāḥ sarvatra smaraṇa ādayaḥ || 	The peculiar character of ‘cause and effect’ is restricted to some minds only; that is how remembrance, etc. come about without obstruction 
kārya kāraṇa bhūtāḥ ca tatra avidyā ādayaḥ matāḥ  | bandhaḥ tad vigama ādiṣṭaḥ muktiḥ nirmala tā dhiyaḥ || 	Ignorance and the rest, in the form of ‘cause and effect’, are held to constitute ‘bondage’, and the cessation of these, as consisting in the purity of the mind, is held to constitute ‘liberation’ 
eka adhikaraṇau siddhau na eva etau laukikau api | bandha mokṣau prasiddham hi kṣaṇikam sarvam eva tat || 	Even in the ordinary world, these two—‘bondage’ and ‘liberation’—are not admitted as appearing in the same substratum; as everything is held to be momentary 
sarvathā atiśaya asattvāt vyāhatā tu ātmani īdṛśī  | kartṛ bhoktṛ tva bandha ādi vyavasthā anitya tā anyathā  || 	As the coming in of any peculiarity is entirely impossible, all notions of the ‘doer and the experienced,’, ‘being in bondage’ and so forth,—in regard to the soul—must be incompatible; or else the soul is something evanescent 
sarvathā atiśaya asattvāt vyāhatā tu ātmani īdṛśī  | kartṛ bhoktṛ tva bandha ādi vyavasthā anitya tā anyathā  || 	As the coming in of any peculiarity is entirely impossible, all notions of the ‘doer and the experienced,’, ‘being in bondage’ and so forth,—in regard to the soul—must be incompatible; or else the soul is something evanescent 
jāti ādeḥ niḥsvabhāva tvam ayuktam prāk prakāśitam  | dravya ādayaḥ ṣaṣ arthāḥ ye vidyante pāramārthikāḥ || iti ākṣapāda kāṇādāḥ prāhuḥ āgama mātrakāḥ  | dravya ādi pratiṣedhaḥ ayam saṅkṣepeṇa tat ucyate || 	The followers of Akṣapāda (Gautama, naiyāyikas) and of Kaṇāda (vaiśeṣikas) have asserted, solely on the strength of verbal authority, that—“the theory of the universal and such things being formless, set forth previously—cannot be right; because the six categories of ‘sub stance’ and the rest do really exist”.—Hence the refutation of these, substance and the rest, is briefly set forth here 
jāti ādeḥ niḥsvabhāva tvam ayuktam prāk prakāśitam  | dravya ādayaḥ ṣaṣ arthāḥ ye vidyante pāramārthikāḥ || iti ākṣapāda kāṇādāḥ prāhuḥ āgama mātrakāḥ  | dravya ādi pratiṣedhaḥ ayam saṅkṣepeṇa tat ucyate || 	The followers of Akṣapāda (Gautama, naiyāyikas) and of Kaṇāda (vaiśeṣikas) have asserted, solely on the strength of verbal authority, that—“the theory of the universal and such things being formless, set forth previously—cannot be right; because the six categories of ‘sub stance’ and the rest do really exist”.—Hence the refutation of these, substance and the rest, is briefly set forth here 
kṣiti ādi bhedataḥ bhinnam navadhā dravyam iṣyate | catur saṅkhyam pṛthivī ādi nitya anitya tayā dvidhā || 	Substance has been held to be of nine kinds—divided under the different heads of ‘earth’ and the rest; of these, the four beginning with the ‘earth’ are of two kinds—eternal and non-eternal 
pṛthivī ādi ātmakāḥ tāvat ye iṣṭāḥ paramāṇavaḥ | te nityāḥ ye tad ādyaiḥ tu prārabdhāḥ te vināśinaḥ || 	The ‘atoms’ that have been held to be of the nature of ‘earth’ and the rest are eternal; while those made up of the atom and the rest are evanescent 
tatra nitya aṇu rūpāṇām asattvam upapāditam | niḥśeṣa vastu viṣaya kṣaṇa bhaṅga prasādhanāt || 	Among these, the non-existence of the eternal (permanent) atoms has already been proved, by establishing the fact of all things being in a state of ‘perpetual flux’ 
nitya tve sakalāḥ sthūlāḥ jāyeran sakṛt eva hi | saṃyoga ādi na ca apekṣyam teṣām asti aviśeṣataḥ || 	If atoms were permanent, then all gross substances would be produced at once; as they are equally independent of conjunction and other conditions 
saddharma upagatam na ucet aṇu utpādakam iṣyate | vidyamāna upalambha artha pramāṇa aviṣaya tvataḥ || 	If the producer of atoms is not held to be endowed with the property of existence, on the ground that it does not form the objective of any means of cognising existent things,—[then the answer is as explained in the following text] 
na asiddheḥ dṛśyate yena kuvinda ādi aṇu kāraṇam | paramāṇu ātmakāḥ eva yena sarve paṭa ādayaḥ || 	The reason adduced cannot be right; because it is inadmissible; as the cause of atoms is actually perceived in the shape of the weaver and the like; inasmuch as the cloth and other things are all constituted of atoms 
sat grāhaka pramā bhāvāt na vā sattā prasidhyati | pramāṇa vinivṛttau hi na artha abhāve asti niścayaḥ || 	It may be that the existence of a thing cannot be known in the absence of a means of the right cognition of the existing thing. But the mere absence of the means of right cognition cannot bring about certainty regarding its being actually nonexistent 
tad ārabdhaḥ tu avayavī guṇa avayava bhedavān | na eva upalabhyate tena na sidhyati apramāṇakaḥ || 	The composite substance made up of atoms,—as distinct from qualities and components,—is never apprehended; hence, there being no evidence for it, it cannot be admitted 
nanu upadhāna saṃparke dṛśyate sphaṭika upalaḥ | tad rūpa agrahaṇe pi evam balākā ādiḥ ca dṛśyate || kañcuka antarite puṃsi tad rūpa ādi agatau api | puruṣa pratyayaḥ dṛṣṭaḥ rakte vāsasi vastra dhīḥ || 	As a matter of fact, the rock-crystal is actually perceived when in contact with another thing, even though its quality is not perceived;—similarly the line of cranes and such things are also seen;—when the man is covered by a long cloak, even though his complexion, etc. are not perceived, there is perception of him as a ‘man’;—in the case of the red cloth, there is perception of it as ‘cloth’.” 
rūpa ādi indīvara ādibhyaḥ ekāntena vibhidyate | tena tasya vyavacchedāt caitra ādeḥ ca turaṅgamaḥ || kṣiti ādi rūpa gandha ādeḥ atyantam vā vibhidyate | eka aneka vacaḥ bhedāt candra nakṣatra bheda vat || 	A) Colour and other qualities are entirely different from the lotus and other things,—because they are distinguished by these (latter)—just as the horse is distinguished by caitra (the rider) B) Or, the earth and other substances are entirely different from colour, odour and other qualities because they are differently spoken of by means of words in the singular and plural numbers (respectively),—just as the ‘moon’ (singular) and the ‘stars’ (plural) are different.” 
vibhinna kartṛ śakti ādeḥ bhinnau tantu paṭau tathā | viruddha dharma yogena stambha kumbha ādi bheda vat || 	Similarly, the yarns and the cloth must be regarded as different,—because they have different makers and different potencies,—just as the pillar and the jar are regarded as different because of the presence of contradictory properties.” 
sthūla artha asaṃbhave tu syāt na eva vṛkṣa ādi darśanam | atīndriya tayā aṇūnām na ca aṇu vacanam bhavet || sthūla vastu vyapekṣaḥ hi su sūkṣmaḥ arthaḥ tathā ucyate | sthūla eka vastu abhāve tu kim apekṣā asya sūkṣma tā 	If there were no gross substances, then the perception of the tree and such things would not be possible; because the atoms are beyond the reach of the senses; nor would the term ‘atom’ (small) be possible; because it is the extremely subtle thing that is so spoken of in relation to a gross substance; hence in the absence of the gross substance, in relation to what would its ‘subtlety’ be?” 
nanu rakta ādi rūpeṇa gṛhyante sphaṭika ādayaḥ | na ca tad rūpa tā teṣām sva pakṣa kṣaya saṅgateḥ || 	In the case op the rock-crystal (cited above), the rock-crystal is perceived as red in colour; and yet, in reality, it cannot be red;—as that would demolish your own theory 
tad rūpa vyatiriktaḥ ca na apara ātmā upalabhyate | na ca anya ākāra dhī vedyāḥ yuktāḥ te atiprasaṅgataḥ || 	Apart prom the colour, nothing else is perceived op the nature op something different; and it cannot be right,—even for you—that things should be apprehended by the cognition op something different; as that would lead to an absurdity 
śukla ādayaḥ tathā vedyāḥ iti evam ca api saṃbhavet | tasmāt bhrāntam idam jñānam kambu pīta ādi buddhi vat || 	It might be possible too in that case, that it is the white colour (of the rock-crystal) itself that is actually cognised; but such a cognition would be clearly wrong,—like the cognition of the conch being yellow 
kañcuka antargate puṃsi na jñānam tvā ānumānikam | tad hetu sanniveśasya kañcukasya upalambhanāt || 	The cognition that appears in the case of the man covered by the cloak is inferential, and does not appertain to the man at all; because what is really cognised in this case is the cloak having the shape due to the man 
kaṣāya kuṅkuma ādibhyaḥ vastre rūpa antara udrayaḥ | pūrvarūpa vināśe hi vāsasaḥ kṣaṇika tvataḥ || 	As a matter of fact, such things as the red dye and the saffron produce a new colour in the cloth, on the destruction of the previous colour; because the cloth itself is momentary (and its previous colour has perished along with it) 
punar jala ādi sāpekṣāt tasmāt eva upajāyate | rūpāt rūpa antaram śuklam loha ādeḥ śyāma tā ādi vat || 	What happens is that out of one colour (red) another white colour is produced through the intervention of water and such other things;—just like the black colour of metals 
tādavasthye tu rūpasya na anyena abhibhavaḥ bhavet | prāktana anabhibhūtasya svarūpasya anuvartanāt || 	If the colour had remained in the same condition, then there could be no suppression of it; as the previous unsuppressed colour would continue to exist 
ṣaṣṭhī vacana bheda ādi vivakṣā mātra saṃbhavi | tatas na yuktā vastūnām tad svarūpa vyavasthitiḥ || 	The diverse ways of verbal expression wherein the genitive and different numbers are used proceed entirely from the speaker’s whim; hence it is not right to determine the real state of things on the basis of such expressions 
tathā hi bhinnam na eva anyaiḥ ṣaṇṇām astitvam iṣyate | teṣām vargaḥ ca na eva ekaḥ kaścid arthaḥ abhyupeyate || 	Further, the other party do not regard the ‘existence’ of the six categories as anything different; nor is any single ‘group’ of them admitted 
saṃjñāpaka pramāṇasya viṣaye tattvam iṣyate | ṣaṇṇām astitvam iti ced ṣaḍbhyaḥ anyaste prasajyate || 	If it be said that—“the existence of the six categories is held to be the property subsisting in what is an object made known by a means of right cognition”,—then, in that case, this would have to be distinct from the six that you postulate 
ṣaṭ ete dharmiṇaḥ proktāḥ dharmāḥ tebhyaḥ atirekiṇaḥ  | iṣṭāḥ eva iti ced kaḥ ayam saṃbandhaḥ tasya taiḥ mataḥ || dravyeṣu niyamāt yuktāḥ na saṃyogaḥ na ca aparaḥ | samavāyaḥ usti na anyaḥ ca saṃbandhaḥ aṅgīkṛtaḥ paraiḥ || 	The six that have been postulated are things with properties, and the properties are certainly admitted by us to be distinct from them.”—If this is said (by the other party), then (we ask)—what is the relation that is held to subsist between the categories and the properties? This relation cannot be that of ‘conjunction’, as this is restricted to substances alone (under the nyāya-view); nor is the other relation, that of ‘inherence’, possible; and no other relation is accepted by the other party 
saṃbandha anupapattau ca teṣām dharmaḥ bhavet katham | tad utpādana mātrāt ced anye api syuḥ tathāvidhāḥ || 	If no relation is possible, then how could the property belong to the categories?—If it were held to belong to them merely on the ground of its being produced by them, then there would be others also like it 
tasya api astitvam iti evam vartate vyatirekiṇī | vibhaktiḥ tasya ca anyasya bhāve aniṣṭhā prasajyate || 	Further, as there would be ‘existence’ of the existence also, the incompatible (genitive) ending would be incompatible with it; and if there were existence of that existence also, and so forth, there would be no end to it 
anya dharma samāveśe prāptā tatra ca dharmi tā | dravya ādeḥ api dharmi tvam asmāt eva ca saṃmatam || 	Thus in all these ‘existences’, the character of ‘being with property’ would be due to the presence therein of another property; and in the case of substance and the rest also, the character of ‘being with property’ has been accepted on the same basis 
prathamebhyaḥ ca tantubhyaḥ paṭasya yadi sādhyate | bhedaḥ sādhana vaiphalyam durnivāram tadā bhavet || prāpta avasthā viśeṣāḥ hi ye jātāḥ tantavaḥ apare | viśiṣṭa artha kriyā āsaktāḥ prathamebhyaḥ avilakṣaṇāḥ || 	If it is the difference of the cloth from the very first yarns that is sought to be proved,—then there is the irresistible defect of ‘futility’. those other yarns also that appear later on, in another state (form), capable of a particular kind of useful action,—are not entirely different in character from those first yarns 
eka kārya upayogi tva jñāpanāya pṛthak śrutau | gaurava aśakti vaiphalya doṣa tyāga abhivāñchayā || sākalyena abhidhānena vyavahārasya lāghavam | manyamānaiḥ kṛtā yeṣu vāc ekā vyavahartṛbhiḥ || tebhyaḥ samāna kālaḥ tu paṭaḥ na eva prasiddhyati  | vibhinna kartṛ sāmarthya parimāṇa ādi dharmavān || 	The intention being to indicate their use in the accomplishment of a single purpose,—if each yarn were spoken of separately, then there would be the defects of (a) prolixity, (b) incapacity, and (c) futility with a view to avoid these, thinking that there would be simplicity of usage if all the yarns were mentioned by a single name, people making use of words have brought forth the single term and applied it to the yarns,—but these (yarns) do not serve to prove the cloth, which is synchronous with those yarns, as having a different maker and different potencies and different size 
anyonya abhisarāḥ ca evam ye jātāḥ paramāṇavaḥ | na eva atīndriya tā teṣām anyānām gocara tvataḥ || 	As a matter of fact, those atoms that have come into existence as mutually helpful,—are not beyond the senses; as they are within reach of the senses 
nīla ādiḥ paramāṇūnām ākāraḥ kalpitaḥ nijaḥ  | nīla ādi pratibhāsā ca vedyate cakṣuḥ ādi dhīḥ || 	The ‘blue’ and other shapes have been postulated in regard to the atoms themselves; and the visual and other cognitions also serve to manifest only those blue and other shapes 
paurvāparya vivekena yadi api eṣām alakṣaṇam | tathā api adhyakṣa tā abādhā pānaka ādau iva sthitā || 	Though they are not perceived in the sequential form,—yet their perceptibility cannot be denied,—it being similar to that of drinks and other things 
sarveṣām eva vastūnām sarva vyāvṛtti rūpiṇām | dṛṣṭau api tathā eva iti na sarva ākāra niścayaḥ || 	As a matter of fact, in the matter of the perception of all things,—which exist only in the form of mutual exclusion (negation),—there is the same uncertainty in regard to all their characters and forms 
akalpana akṣa gamye api niraṃśe arthasya lakṣaṇe | yad bheda vyavasāye asti kāraṇam sa pratīyate || 	Even though, the thing being impartite, its character is apprehensible only by indeterminate perception, yet there is definite (certain) cognition of its differentiation (from other things); and it is this definite cognition that is understood to be the cause (of certainty) 
samāna jvālā saṃbhūteḥ yathā dīpena vibhramaḥ | nairantarya sthita aneka sūkṣma vittau tathā ekadhā || 	Just as in the case of the lamp it is only a series of similar flames which brings about the illusion (of its being one); so [in the case of the mountain also], there is an illusion of unity, even though what are really cognised are several subtle entities appearing in close juxtaposition 
viveka alakṣaṇāt teṣām no ced pratyakṣa tā iṣyate | dīpa ādau sā katham dṛṣṭā kim vā iṣṭaḥ avayavī tathā || 	If the perceptibility of atoms is not admitted because of their being not-differentiated, then how is it seen in the case of the lamp and such things? or, is the composite held to be of that kind? 
etāvat tu bhavet atra katham eṣām na niścaye | nīla ādi paramāṇūnām ākāraḥ iti gamyate || tat api akāraṇam yasmāt na eva jñānam agocaram | na ca eka sthūla viṣayam sthaulya eka tva virodhataḥ || 	All, that can be urged is—“on the definite cognition of these (atoms), how is it that it is not realised that what is perceived as blue is the form of the atoms?”—But that also cannot be the cause; because the cognition in question cannot be without an object; and yet it cannot have for its object a single gross object, as there is incompatibility between grossness and one-ness 
sthūlasya eka svabhāva tve makṣikā pada mātrataḥ | pidhāne pihitam sarvam āsajyeta avibhāgataḥ || rakte ca bhāgaḥ ekasmin sarvam rajyeta rakta vat | viruddha dharma bhāve vā nānā tvam anuṣajyate || 	If the gross object were op the nature of one only, then on even part op it being covered by the little leg op a plea, all of it would become covered, without any distinction;—and on one part op it being reddened, all of it would become coloured red.—Or, on the contrary, the presence op incompatible properties would indicate multiplicity 
nanu ca eka svabhāva tvāt sarva śabdaḥ atra kiṃkṛtaḥ | sa hi aneka artha viṣayaḥ nānā ātma avayavī na ca || 	Inasmuch as the object is of one uniform character, to what would the use of the term ‘sarva’ (‘all’) be due? Because that term denotes more than one individual thing, while the composite is not of the nature of many individuals.” 
nanu ye lokataḥ siddhāḥ vāsaḥ deha naga ādayaḥ  | te eva avayavi tvena bhavadbhiḥ upavarṇitāḥ  || raktam vāsaḥ akhilam sarvam niḥśeṣam nikhilam tathā  | tatra icchā mātra saṃbhūtam iti sarve prayuñjate || tathāvidha vivakṣāyām asmābhiḥ api varṇyate | sarvam syāt raktam ityādi nirnibandhāḥ hi vācakāḥ || 	It is only such things as are well known in the world,—such as cloth, body, mountain and so forth,—that have been mentioned by you as ‘composites’;—and as a matter of fact, all men make use of such expressions as ‘the cloth is red—all of it—whole of it—in its totality—completely’,—entirely on the basis of their whim.—Thus the use of verbal expressions being dependent upon the whim of the speaker, we also make use of the expression ‘all of the object would be reddened’; because there can be no check upon speakers 
bhāktam tad abhidhānam ced vacaḥ bhedaḥ prasajyate | na ca buddheḥ vibhedaḥ asti gauṇa mukhya tayā iṣṭayoḥ  || 	If the name be said to be figurative (indirect), then there should be difference in number. there is also no difference in the cognition, which is admitted by both (though directly and indirectly) 
nanu ca avyāpya vṛtti tvāt saṃyogasya na rakta tā  | sarvasya āsajyate na api sarvam āvṛtam īkṣyate || 	Inasmuch as conjunction is not all-embracing in its character, the colouring cannot belong to all the cloth; nor is the whole found to be covered.” 
nanu ca anaṃśake dravye kim avyāptam vyavasthitam  | svarūpam tad avasthāne bhedaḥ siddhaḥ ataeva vā || bahu deśa sthitiḥ tena na eva ekasmin kṛta āspadā  | tatas siddhā paṭa ādīnām aṇubhyaḥ aneka rūpa tā 	When the substance has no parts, what form would be there that would not be embraced (by the conjunction)? If such an (unembraced) form of the substance remained there, then diversity becomes established.—Existence in several places is not possible for any single object. hence it becomes established that things like the cloth are different in form from the atoms (composing them) 
avijñāta artha tattvaḥ tu piṇḍam ekam ca manyate | lokaḥ tad kalpita apekṣaḥ paramāṇuḥ iha ucyate || 	It is only people who have not understood the real nature of things that conceive of ‘one mass’; and it is on the basis of this assumption that the term ‘atom’ is used 
nimitta nirapekṣā vā saṃjñā iyam tādṛśi sthitā  | saṅketa anvayinī yadvat nirvitte api īśvara śrutiḥ  || 	Or, the name ‘atom’, as applied to what has been described, may be taken as baseless, dependent upon mere convention; just as the name ‘lord’ is applied to one who has no property at all 
eka avayavi anugatāḥ na eva tantu kara ādayaḥ  | aneka tvāt yathā asiddhāḥ kaṭa kuṭya kuṭa ādayaḥ || yadi vā abhimatam dravyam na aneka avayava āśritam  | eka tvāt aṇu vat vṛtteḥ ayuktiḥ bādhikā pramā || 	A) such things as the yarns and the hand and other limbs cannot be permeated by any single ‘composite’,—because they are more than one,—like such well-known things as straw, hut and jar.—or (B)—the substance in question cannot subsist in several components,—because it is one,—like the atom.—And (C) impossibility of subsistence would be the proof annulling the other party’s proposition 
tat hi eka vṛtti bhājā eva rūpeṇa avayava antare | varteta yadi vā anyena na prakāra antaram yatas || tatra tena eva na anyatra vṛttiḥ asya avakalpate | tena kroḍīkṛta tvena na anyathā tatra vṛttimat || 	If the composite subsisted in the components] it could subsist in one component, either exactly in the form in which it subsists in another component, or in some other form. No third way is possible.—It is not possible for it to subsist in one exactly in the form in which it subsists in another; because it is already embraced within its fold by the latter. If it were not so, then it would not be subsisting in that either 
na eva dhātrī antara kroḍam adhyāste hi yathā śiśuḥ | eka kroḍīkṛtam dravyam na āśrayeta tathā aparam || 	Just as the baby does not occupy the lap of a second nurse,—so a substance embraced in one could not subsist in another (component) 
tad saṃbaddha svabhāvasya hi a tad deśe api vṛttitaḥ  | prāptam tad eka deśa tvam aikātmyam ca avibhāgataḥ || anyena eva ātmanā vṛttau na ekaḥ aneka vyavasthitaḥ  | siddhyet svabhāva bhedasya vastu bheda ātmaka tvataḥ || 	If the composite essentially related to one component subsisted in some other component occupying a place other than that of the said component,—then it would mean that the two components occupy the same place and are essentially one and the same, because they are not differentiated if, on the other hand, the composite subsisted in the other component in another form,—then as occupying two places, the composite could not be one; specially as difference in form (and character) must constitute difference in the thing itself 
samavāya ātmikā vṛttiḥ tasya teṣu iti ced nanu | tasyām api vicāraḥ ayam kopena eva pradhāvati || 	If it be held that the subsistence of the composite in the components is of the nature of ‘inherence’—then the same considerations as above follow that idea also with equal force 
yat vā sarva ātmanā vṛttau aneka tvam prasajyate | eka deśena ca aniṣṭāḥ na ekaḥ vā na kvacid ca saḥ || 	Or again, if it (the composite) subsists (in the component) in its entirety,—then it becomes liable to being regarded as many; as for its subsistence in part, that is not what is held (by the other party); and the composite would (in that case) not be one; and it would not subsist anywhere at all 
svātantryeṇa prasaṅgena sādhanam yat pravarttate | svayam tad upalabdhau hi satyam saṅgacchate na tu  || na ca kārtsnya eka deśābhyām vṛttiḥ kvacana lakṣitā  | yasyāḥ asaṃbhavāt dravyam asat syāt aparaḥ api ca || dṛṣṭau vā kvacid etasyāḥ dravya ādau anivāraṇam  | atha tasmin adṛṣṭau tu bhede praśnaḥ na yujyate  || etāvat tu bhavet vācyam vṛttiḥ na asti iti tat ca na  | yuktam pratyakṣataḥ siddheḥ iha idam iti buddhitaḥ 	Whenever a reason is adduced,—either directly or in the form of a reductio ad absurdum,—it becomes truly applicable only when it is itself apprehended;—not otherwise.—As a matter of fact, subsistence either in whole or in part has never been perceived (by you, buddhists),—on the basis of the impossibility of which in the substance, the substance could be held to be non-existent, or something else—if, on the other hand, such subsistence has been perceived by you anywhere, then it cannot be denied in the case of the substance and such things.—If the said subsistence has not been perceived, then the question does not arise regarding the distinction; all that could be asserted would be that ‘the subsistence is not there’, and this would not be right; as it is something directly perceived; as is clear in such notions as ‘this subsists here’.—If it be held that ‘the fact of this being direct perception is not admitted’, then some annulling reasoning should be put forward. Otherwise, even such cognitions as those of colour and such things might cease to be of the nature of ‘perception’.” 
tat atra vṛttiḥ na asti iti prāk abhedena sādhitam | iha iti asti na ca jñānam tad rūpa apratibhāsanāt || 	That ‘the subsistence is not there’ has already been established above, in a general way. As for the notion that ‘it subsists herein’, there is no such cognition at all; as this exact form does not appear in any cognition 
kṛtsna eka deśa śabdābhyām ayam ca arthaḥ prakāśyate | nairaṃśyena asya kim vṛttiḥ kim vā tasya anyathā eva sā || yathā pātra ādi saṃsthasya śrīphala ādeḥ yathā athavā | aneka āsana saṃsthasya caitra ādeḥ upalakṣitā || 	What is meant by (the question containing) the terms ‘in entirety’ and ‘in part’ is—does the substance subsist as an impartite whole,—in the way in which the bilva-fruit lies in a dish? Or does it subsist in some other way—as a certain person, caitra, does when lying down on several seats? 
samāśritāḥ kvacid śabdāḥ vināśi tva ādi hetutaḥ | ghaṭa dīpa ādi vat tat ca kila vyoma bhaviṣyati || 	Sounds must subsist in something,—because of their perishability and such other characters; like the jar, the lamp-flame and such things;—and this something must be ākāśa” 
āditya ādi kriyā dravya vyatireka nibandhanam | para apara ādi vijñānam ghaṭa ādi pratyayaḥ yathā || valī palita kārkaśya gati ādi pratyayāt idam | yatas vilakṣaṇam hetuḥ sa ca kālaḥ kila iṣyate || 	The notion of priority, posteriority and so forth must have for its basis something other than mobile substances like the sun,—like the notion of the jar and such things,—because it is entirely different in character from the notion of wrinkles, grey hairs, emaciation and so forth;—and it is this basis, cause, which is held to be ‘time’.” 
pūrva apara ādi buddhibhyaḥ diś evam anumīyate | krameṇa jñāna jātyā ca manasaḥ anumitiḥ matā || cakṣuḥ ādi vibhinnam ca kāraṇam samapekṣate | krameṇa jātā rūpa ādi pratipattī ratha ādi vat || 	Similarly space is inferred from such notions as ‘fore’ and ‘aft’.”a) “The mind has been held to be inferred from the successive appearance of cognitions; which requires a cause different from the eye and other sense-organs. as a matter of fact, the cognitions of colour and such things appear successively,—like the chariot and such things.”b-626) 
upātta ādi mahābhūta hetu tva aṅgīkṛteḥ dhvaneḥ  | siddhāḥ eva āśritāḥ śabdāḥ teṣu ityādyam asādhanam || 	Inasmuch as sound is already accepted as having its cause in the ‘great elements’ that have been acknowledged (or not-acknowledged),—it is already admitted that sounds subsist in those elements. So that the first reason put forward (for the existence of ākāśa) cannot prove (what it is meant to prove) 
eka vyāpi dhruva vyoma samavāyaḥ tu siddhyati  | na eṣām anvaya vaikalyāt akrama ādi āptitaḥ tathā  || 	The subsistence of sounds in ākāśa,—which is one, all-pervading and eternal,—cannot be proved (by the reason adduced),—because it is devoid of ‘positive concomitance’;—and also because there would be absence of succession and so forth; as also universal contact 
viśiṣṭa samaya udbhūta manaskāra nibandhanam | parāpara ādi vijñānam na kālāt na diśaḥ ca tat || niraṃśa eka svabhāva tvāt paurvāparya ādi asambhavaḥ | tayoḥ saṃbandhi bhedāt ced evam tau niṣphalau nanu || 	The notions of ‘priority and posteriority’ (and of ‘fore and aft’) are based upon a conception arising out of particular conventions; they are not due to ‘time’, nor to ‘space’. Inasmuch as these are impartite, one, ‘priority’, ‘posteriority’ and the like are not possible in them. If the notions be said to be based upon the things related to them, then they themselves become useless 
cakṣuḥ ādi atiriktam tu manaḥ asmābhiḥ api iṣyate | ṣaṇṇām anantara udbhūta pratyayaḥ yaḥ hi tat manaḥ || nitye tu manasi prāptāḥ pratyayāḥ yaugapadyataḥ | tena hetuḥ iha proktaḥ bhavati iṣṭa vighāta kṛt || 	Mind’ as distinct from the ‘eye’, etc. is admitted by its also; that idea being regarded as ‘mind’ which appears immediately after the six (cognitions).—If however the mind is regarded as permanent, then there comes the anomaly of cognitions being simultaneous; thus the reason put forward by you becomes destructive of what is desired 
saugata apara nirdiṣṭa manaḥ saṃsiddhi asiddhaye | sa ākāram anyathā āvṛttam manye sūtram idam kṛtam || 	I think that the sūtra (nyāya-sūtra 1.1.36) has been composed for the purpose of proving and disproving the mind as postulated by the Buddha, and the other philosopher (respectively),—and hence it has been repeated with an additional ‘a’ (‘not’) 
saugata apara nirdiṣṭa manaḥ saṃsiddhi asiddhaye | sa ākāram anyathā āvṛttam manye sūtram idam kṛtam || 	I think that the sūtra (nyāya-sūtra 1.1.36) has been composed for the purpose of proving and disproving the mind as postulated by the Buddha, and the other philosopher (respectively),—and hence it has been repeated with an additional ‘a’ (‘not’) 
dravyāṇām pratiṣedhena sarve eva tad āśritāḥ | guṇa karma ādayaḥ apāstāḥ bhavanti eva tathā matāḥ || 	By the rejection of ‘substance’, ‘quality ‘action’ and the rest, which are held to be subsistent in substance, all become discarded 
dravyāṇām pratiṣedhena sarve eva tad āśritāḥ | guṇa karma ādayaḥ apāstāḥ bhavanti eva tathā matāḥ || 	By the rejection of ‘substance’, ‘quality ‘action’ and the rest, which are held to be subsistent in substance, all become discarded 
kva kasya samavāyaḥ ca saṃbandhini apahastite | viśeṣa pratiṣedhaḥ ayam tathā api punar ucyate || 	The ‘relative’ (wherein the relation could subsist) having been discarded, whose ‘subsistence’ would it be? and where? still a detailed denial of each (category) is going to be set forth 
dravye mahati nīla ādiḥ ekaḥ eva yadi iṣyate | randhra ālokena tad vyaktau vyaktiḥ dṛṣṭiḥ ca na asya kim || 	If in a large substance, the blue colour is held to be one only,—then how is it that there is no manifestation and perception of it when it is seen in light coming through an aperture? 
na ca deśa vibhāgena sthitaḥ nīla ādiḥ iṣyate | vyajyate yaḥ tadā tena tasya bhedaḥ aṇuśas tatas || 	The blue colour is hot held to exist in well-defined parts; hence what is manifested then by that (light) must, on that account, vary with each atom 
a tad rūpa parāvṛtta gaja ādi vyatirekiṇī | na saṅkhyā bhāsate jñāne dṛśyā iṣṭā na eva sā asti tat || 	Number’, which is held to be perceptible, does not appear in cognition as anything distinct from such names as ‘the elephant’, etc. which connote ‘negation op the contrary’ hence it must be nonexistent 
icchā racita saṅketa manaskāra anvayam tu idam | ghaṭeṣu eka ādi vijñānam jñāna ādau iva vartate || adravya tvāt na saṅkhyā asti teṣu kācid vibhedinī | tad jñānam na eva yuktam tu bhāktam askhalita tvataḥ || 	As in cognition, so in things like the jar also, the notion of ‘one’ and the rest is one that follows only from an imaginary convention set up by a mere whim.—there can be no differentiating number in these (cognitions), because they are not ‘substance—nor can the notion be said to be ‘figurative’, as it is not found to be fallible 
tad dravya samavetāt ced eka tvāt parikalpyate | guṇa ādiṣu eka vijñānam eka artha samavāyataḥ || 	The notion of one in regard to cognitions is assumed on the basis of the one-ness subsisting in that same substance, on account of their subsisting in the same thing”,—if this is asserted [then the answer is as in the following text] 
astu nāma evam ekatra jñāne vyāpti dvi ādi matiḥ tu kam | eteṣu apekṣate hetum ṣaṣ padārtha ādikeṣu vā || eka artha samavāya ādeḥ gauṇaḥ ayam pratyayaḥ bhavan | tathā ca skhalitaḥ yasmāt māṇave anala buddhi vat || 	The number ‘one’ may subsist in the one cognition; but on what basis does the notion of ‘two’ proceed, in reference to cognitions? Or even in regard to the ‘six categories’ and the rest?—The notion too of its ‘subsisting in the same thing’ can only be figurative, and hence fallible,—like the notion of ‘fire’ in regard to the boy 
gaja ādi pratyayebhyaḥ ca vailakṣaṇyāt prasādhyate | saṅkhyā buddhiḥ tad anya utthā nīla vastra ādi buddhi vat || 	The notion of number is established on the basis of its being different from the notion of the ‘elephant’ and other things; the said notion (of number) must arise from things other than those,—just like the notion of the ‘blue cloth’ and the like.” commentary. 
icchā racita saṅketa manaskāra ādi upāyataḥ | tatra iṣṭa siddhiḥ buddhi ādau saṅkhyā etena eva vā bhavet || 	What is desired to be proved could be proved as being due to such causes as an imaginary convention arising from mere whim and so forth. The existence of ‘number’ in cognition and other things also may be due to the same cause 
buddhi apekṣā ca saṅkhyāyāḥ niṣpattiḥ yadi varṇyate | saṅketa ābhoga mātreṇa tad buddhiḥ kim na saṃmatā || 	If the accomplishment of the number be explained as dependent upon cognitions,—then, why cannot the notion be accepted as due to mere convention? 
mahat dīrgha ādi bhedena parimāṇam yat ucyate | tat api arthe tathā rūpa bhedāt eva na kim matam || 	Dimension’ has been classed as ‘large ‘long’ and the like;—why cannot it be regarded as due to diversity of forms in the thing itself? 
dīrghā prāsāda mālā iti mahatī vedyate yathā | nahi tatra yathārūpam parimāṇam prakalpitam || eka artha samavāyena tathā ced vyapadiśyate | na mahat tvam na dairghyam ca dhāma svasti vivakṣitam || 	A line of mansions is conceived of as ‘large’; and yet no ‘dimension’ commensurate with the form of the line is assumed. If it be said that it is spoken of as such on the basis of the quality subsisting in the same object (mansion),—then the answer is that neither ‘largeness’ nor ‘length’ is ever meant to belong to mansions 
prāsādaḥ ca iṣyate yogaḥ guṇaḥ saḥ aparimāṇavān | na tasya asti aparā mālā na upacārasya ca āśrayaḥ || 	The ‘palace’ is held by you to be a ‘conglomeration’, which is a quality; which, as such, cannot have dimension (which is another quality); nor can there be another ‘line’ of it. Nor can recourse be had to figurative expression
