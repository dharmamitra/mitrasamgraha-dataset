yataḥ sarvāṇi bhūtānipratibhānti sthitāni ca /  yatraivopaśamaṃ yānti tasmaisatyātmane namaḥ // 	Hail The Eternal. Om, salutation to the self-same Reality, from whom all beings proceed, by whom they are manifest, upon whom they depend, and in whom they become extinct.  
jñātā jñānaṃ tathā jñeyaṃ draṣṭādarśanadṛśyabhūḥ / kartā hetuḥ kriyā yasmāttasmai jñasyātmane namaḥ // 	He is the knower, the knowledge and all that is to be known. He is the seer, the (act of) seeing, and all that is to be seen. He is the actor, the cause and the effect: therefore salutation to Him (who is all) knowledge himself.  
sphuranti sīkarā yasmādānandasyāmbare'vanau / sarveṣāṃ jīvanaṃ tasmai brahmānandātmane namaḥ // 	Salutation to Him (who is) supreme bliss itself, from whom flow the dews of delight (as water springs from a fountain) both in heaven and earth, and who is the life of all.  
sutīkṣṇo brāhmaṇaḥ kaścitsaṃśayākṛṣṭamānasaḥ / agasterāśramaṃ gatvā muniṃ papraccha sādaram // 	One Sutikshna, a Brahmana, whose mind was full of doubts, went to the hermitage of Agasti and asked the sage respectfully:—  
sutīkṣṇa uvāca / bhagavandharmatattvajña sarvaśāstraviniścita / saṃśayo'sti mahānekastvametaṃ kṛpayā vada // 	Oh great sage! that art informed in all the ways and truths of virtue, and knowest with certainty all the Sastras, I am in a great doubt (about something) which I pray you will kindly remove.  
mokṣasya kāraṇaṃ karma jñānaṃ vā mokṣasādhanam / ubhayaṃ vā viniścitya ekaṃ kathaya kāraṇam // 	Tell me whether a man's acts or his knowledge or both of these, is in your opinion, the cause of his emancipation.  
agastiruvāca / ubhābhyāmeva pakṣābhyāṃ yathā khe pakṣiṇāṃ gatiḥ / tathaiva jñānakarmabhyāṃ jāyate paramaṃ padam // 	Agasti replied:—As the flight of birds in the air is effected by means of both their wings, so the highest state of emancipation is attained through the instrumentality of both knowledge and acts.  
kevalātkarmaṇo jñānānnahi mokṣo'bhijāyate / kiṃtūbhābhyāṃ bhavenmokṣaḥ sādhanaṃ tūbhayaṃ viduḥ // 	It is neither our acts nor knowledge alone that produces emancipation, but both together are known as the means of it.  
asminnarthe purāvṛttamitihāsaṃ vadāmi te / kāruṇyākhyaḥ purā kaścidbrāhmaṇo'dhītavedakaḥ // 	I will recite to you an instance on this subject from the old traditions, relating a Brahman named Karunya, who was learned in the Vedas in days of yore.  
agniveśyasya putro'bhūdvedavedāṅgapāragaḥ / guroradhītavidyaḥ sannājagāma gṛhaṃ prati // 	He was the son of Agnivesya and accomplished in the Vedas and all their branches, and after finishing his studies at the preceptor's, returned to his own abode.  
tasthāvakarmakṛttūṣṇīṃ saṃśayāno gṛhe tadā / agniveśyo vilokyātha putraṃ karmavivarjitam // 	He remained a sceptic at home, holding his taciturnity and inertness to acts: when his father Agnivesya saw his son so slack in his duties, he upbraided him thus for his good.  
agniveśya uvāca / prāha etadvaco nindyaṃ guruḥ putraṃ hitāya ca / kimetatputra kuruṣe pālanaṃ na svakarmaṇaḥ // 	Agnivesya said:—Why my son do you not discharge your duties, tell me how can you succeed (in anything) if you remain inactive, and tell me also the reason of your cessation from acts.  
akarmanirataḥ siddhiṃ kathaṃ prāpsyasi tadvada / karmaṇo'smānnivṛtteḥ kiṃ kāraṇaṃ tannivedyatām // 	Agnivesya said:—Why my son do you not discharge your duties, tell me how can you succeed (in anything) if you remain inactive, and tell me also the reason of your cessation from acts.  
kāruṇya uvāca / yāvajjīvamagnihotraṃ nityaṃ saṃdhyāmupāsayet / pravṛttirūpo dharmo'yaṃ śrutyā smṛtyā ca coditaḥ // 	Karunya replied:—The offering of daily oblations, and performance of morning and evening devotions during life, are inculcated in the Veda and law as the active duties.  
na dhanena bhavenmokṣaḥ karmaṇā prajayā na vā / tyāgamātreṇa kiṃtveke yatayo'śnanti cāmṛtam // 	But it is neither by acts or riches, nor by means of progeny, that one obtains his liberation, it is solely by self-denial that Stoics taste the ambrosia.  
iti śrutyordvayormadhye kiṃ kartavyaṃ mayā guro / iti saṃdigdhatāṃ gatvā tūṣṇīṃbhūto'smi karmaṇi // 	Tell me my father! which of these two ordinances is to be observed by me? Doubtful of this I have become indifferent to acts.  
agastiruvāca / ityuktvā tāta vipro'sau kāruṇyo maunamāgataḥ / tathāvidhaṃ sutaṃ dṛṣṭvā punaḥ prāha guruḥ sutam // 	Agasti said:—Hear me my son, that Karunya after saying so held his silence; when his father seeing him thus, rejoined his speech.  
agniveśya uvāca / śṛṇu putra kathāmekāṃ tadarthaṃ hṛdaye'khilam / matto'vadhārya putra tvaṃ yathecchasi tathā kuru // 	Agnivesya said:—Hear me relate a narrative (to you) my son, and you having fully considered its purport in your mind, may do as you may choose.  
surucirnāma kācitstrī apsarogaṇauttamā / upaviṣṭā himavataḥ śikhare śikhisaṃvṛte // 	There was a damsel named Suruchi, the best of the Apsara nymphs, who was seated on the mountain peak of Himalaya, beset by peacocks around.  
ramante kāmasaṃtaptāḥ kinnaryo yatra kinnaraiḥ / svardhunyoghena saṃsṛṣṭe mahāghaughavināśinā // 	Here Kinnaras inflamed by love sported with their mates, and the fall of heavenly streams (Ganga and Yamuna), served to expurgate the gravest sins.  
dūtamindrasya gacchantamantarikṣe dadarśa sā / tamuvāca mahābhāgā suruciścāpsarovarā // 	She beheld a messenger of Indra making his way through the sky; and then this most fortunate and best of Apsaras, addressed him thus:  
suruciruvāca / devadūta mahābhāga kuta āgamyate tvayā / adhunā kutra gantāsi tatsarvaṃ kṛpayā vada // 	Suruchi said:—O thou herald of gods, tell me kindly whence thou comest and whither art thou destined at present.  
devadūta uvāca / sādhu pṛṣṭaṃ tvayā subhru yathāvatkathayāmi te / ariṣṭanemī rājarṣirdattvā rājyaṃ sutāya vai // 	The divine ariel replied:—Well hast thou asked Oh pretty browed maid, and I will tell thee all as it is. Know, Arishtanemi the royal sage, who has made over his realm to his son.  
vītarāgaḥ sa dharmātmā niryayau tapase vanam / tapaścaratyasau rājā parvate gandhamādane // 	He has (now) with religious indifference (to the world), set out to the forest for (practice of) asceticism, and is performing his austerities on the Gandha Madana mountains.  
kāryaṃ kṛtvā mayā tatra tata āgamyate'5dhunā / gantāsmi pārśve śakrasya taṃ vṛttāntaṃ niveditum // 	I am now returning from there after discharge of my errand, and repairing to Sakra's (palace) to report the matter.  
apsarā uvāca / vṛttāntaḥ ko'bhavattatra kathayasva mama prabho / praṣṭukāmā vinītāsmi nodvegaṃ kartumarhasi // 	Suruchi said:—Tell me, my Lord, what matter has taken place there. I am with submission (much) inquisitive after it, nor shouldest thou cause me (the pain of) anxiety.  
devadūta uvāca / śṛṇu bhadre yathāvṛttaṃ vistareṇa vadāmi te / tasminrājñi vane tatra tapaścarati dustaram // 	The messenger replied:—Hear me gentle maid, relate to thee in length (everything) as it has occurred.  
ityahaṃ devarājena subhrūrājñāpitastadā / dūta tvaṃ tatra gacchāśu gṛhītvedaṃ vimānakam // 	On hearing that the king was practising the utmost rigors of asceticism in that forest, Indra, the lord of Gods, desired me to take this heavenly car and repair at once to the spot.  
apsarogaṇasaṃyuktaṃ nānāvāditraśobhitam / gandharvasiddhayakṣaiśca kinnarādyaiśca śobhitam // 	“Take this car,” said he, “bearing the (dancing) Apsaras equipped with all their musical instruments, and furnished with a band of Gandharvas, Siddhas, Yakshas and Kinnaras.”  
tālaveṇumṛdaṅgādi parvate gandhamādane / nānāvṛkṣasamākīrṇe gatvā tasmingirau śubhe // 	“Convey them,” said he, “with all their wired instruments, flutes and drums to the auspices of the Sylvan mount of Gandha Madana.”  
ariṣṭanemiṃ rājānaṃ dūtāropya vimānake / ānaya svargabhogāya nagarīmamarāvatīm // 	“There having placed the Prince Aristanemi in the vehicle, bring him to the enjoyment of heavenly delight in this city of Amaravati (the seat of immortals).”  
dūta uvāca / ityājñāṃ prāpya śakrasya gṛhītvā tadvimānakam / sarvopaskarasaṃyuktaṃ tasminnadrāvahaṃ yayau // 	The messenger added:—Receiving this injunction of Indra and taking the car with all its equipments, I proceeded to that mountain.  
āgatya parvate tasminrājño gatvā''śramaṃ mayā / niveditā mahendrasya sarvājñā'riṣṭanemaye // 	Having arrived at the mountain and advancing to the hermitage of the king, I delivered to him the orders of the great Indra.  
iti madvacanaṃ śrutvā saṃśayāno'vadacchubhe / rājovāca / praṣṭumicchāmi dūta tvāṃ tanme tvaṃ vaktumarhasi // 	Hearing my words, Oh happy damsel! the king spoke to me with reluctance and said: “I wish to ask thee something O messenger, which (I hope) thou wilt deign to answer.”  
guṇā doṣāśca ke tatra svarge vada mamāgrataḥ / jñātvā sthitiṃ tu tatratyāṃ kariṣye'haṃ yathāruci // 	“Tell me what good and what evils there are in heaven, that knowing them (beforehand), I may think of settling there as I may choose.”  
dūta uvāca / svarge puṇyasya sāmagryā bhujyate paramaṃ sukham / uttamena tu puṇyena prāpnoti svargamuttamam // 	I answered, saying:—In heaven there is ample reward for merit, conferring perfect bliss (to all); but it is the degree of meritoriousness that leads one to higher heavens.  
madhyamena tathā madhyaḥ svargo bhavati nānyathā / kaniṣṭhena tu puṇyena svargo bhavati tādṛśaḥ // 	By moderate virtue, one is certainly entitled to a middle station, and virtue of an inferior order, leads a person to a lower position.  
parotkarṣāsahiṣṇutvaṃ spardhā caiva samaiśca taiḥ / kaniṣṭheṣu ca saṃtoṣo yāvatpuṇyakṣayo bhavet // 	But one's virtue is destroyed by his impatience at the excellence of his betters, by his haughtiness to his equals, and by his joy at the inferiority of others.  
kṣīṇe puṇye viśantyetaṃ martyalokaṃ ca mānavāḥ / ityādiguṇadoṣāśca svarge rājannavasthitāḥ // 	When one's virtue is thus destroyed, he must enter the abode of mortals. These and the like are the effects of merit and demerit (with us) in heaven.  
iti śrutvā vaco bhadre sa rājā pratyabhāṣata / rājovāca / necchāmi devadūtāhaṃ svargamīdṛgvidhaṃ phalam // 	Hearing this, Oh good maiden, the king answered and said: “I do not, Oh divine messenger! like the heaven that is of such like conditions.”  
ataḥ paraṃ mahograṃ ca tapaḥ kṛtvā kalevaram / tyakṣyāmyahamaśuddhaṃ hi jīrṇāṃ tvacamivoragaḥ // 	"I will henceforth practise the most austere form of devotion, and abandon this my unhallowed human frame in the same way, as the snake abandons his time-worn-skin.  
devadūta vimānedaṃ gṛhītvā tvaṃ yathāgataḥ / tathā gaccha mahendrasya saṃnidhau tvaṃ namo'stu te // 	“Be thou pleased, Oh delegate of the Gods! to return with thy heavenly car to the presence of the great Indra whence thou comest, and fare thee well.”  
devadūta uvāca / ityukto'haṃ gato bhadre śakrasyāgre nivedituma / yathāvṛttaṃ nivedyātha mahadāścaryatāṃ gataḥ // 	The celestial emissary resumed:—Thus being bid, I went Oh goodly dame to the presence of Sakra to report the matter. Who upon my rehearsal of the matter, was struck with great wonder.  
indra uvāca / punaḥ prāha mahendro māṃ ślakṣṇaṃ madhurayā girā / dūta gaccha punastatra taṃ rājānaṃ nayāśramam // 	Then the great Indra again spoke to me with a sweet voice and said: “Go you my herald again to that king, and take him to the hermitage of Valmiki.”  
vālmīkerjñātatattvasya svabodhārthaṃ virāgiṇam / saṃdeśaṃ mama vālmīkermaharṣestvaṃ nivedaya // 	He is well acquainted with every truth, tell him my errand for the instruction of the dispassionate prince, saying:—  "
maharṣe tvaṃ vinītāya rājñe'smai vītarāgiṇe / nasvargamicchate tattvaṃ prabodhaya mahāmune // 	"Oh thou great sage! remonstrate with this prince who is humble and dispassionate, and dislikes the enjoyments of heaven.  
tena saṃsāraduḥkhārto mokṣameṣyati ca kramāt / ityuktvā devarājena preṣito'haṃ tadantike // 	“So that this prince who is aggrieved at the miseries of the world, may gradually come to attain his emancipation.”  
mayāgatya punastatra rājā valmīkajanmane / nivedito mahendrasya rājñā mokṣasya sādhanam // 	I then went and explained my mission to the royal hermit, took him to the sage Valmiki (who had grown amidst the ant-hills), and to whom I delivered great Indra's charge for the king's practice (of the means) for his final liberation.  
tato valmīkajanmāsau rājānaṃ samapṛcchata / anāmayamatiprītyā kuśalapraśnavārtayā // 	Then the sage (named after the ant-hill in which he had grown), welcomed the King with gentle inquiries regarding his welfare.  
rājovāca / bhagavandharmatattvajña jñātajñeya vidāṃvara / kṛtārtho'haṃ bhavaddṛṣṭyā tadeva kuśalaṃ mama // 	The prince replied:—Oh great seer, that art informed in all the truths of religion, and art the greatest of them that know the knowable, thy very sight has given me all that I desired, and therein is all my welfare.  "
bhagavanpraṣṭumicchāmi tadavighnena me vada / saṃsārabandhaduḥkhārteḥ kathaṃ muñcāmi tadvada // 	“Great sire, I wish to learn from thee how I may escape the miseries which arise from one's connection with this world, and which (I hope) thou wilt reveal to me without reserve.”  
vālmīkiruvāca / śrṛṇu rājanpravakṣyāmi rāmāyaṇamakhaṇḍitam / śrutvāvadhārya yatnena jīvanmukto bhaviṣyasi // 	Valmiki said:—Hear me Oh king! I will relate to you the entire Ramayana, by the hearing and understanding of which you will be saved even while in this life.  
vasiṣṭharāmasaṃvādaṃ mokṣopāyakathāṃ śubhāma / jñātasvabhāvo rājendra vadāmi śrūyatāṃ budha // 	Hear me Oh great and intelligent king, repeat to you the sacred conversation which took place between Rama and Vasishtha relating the way to liberation, and which I well know from my knowledge.  
rājovāca / ko rāmaḥ kīdṛśaḥ kasya baddho vā mukta eva vā / etanme niścitaṃ brūhi jñānaṃ tattvavidāṃ vara // 	The prince said:—“O thou best of sages, tell me precisely who and what this Rama was, what was his bondage and how he got freed from it.”  
vālmīkiruvāca / śāpavyājavaśādeva rājaveṣadharo hariḥ / āhṛtājñānasaṃpannaḥ kiṃcijjño'sau bhavatprabhuḥ // 	Valmiki said:—Hari was proscribed under an imprecation to take upon himself the form of a prince, with an assumed ignorance as that of a man of little understanding.  
rājovāca / cidānandasvarūpe hi rāme caitanyavigrahe / śāpasya kāraṇaṃ brūhi kaḥ śaptā ceti me vada // 	The prince said: “Tell me who was the author of that imprecation, and how it could befall on Rama, who was the personification of consciousness and felicity, and the very image of wisdom.”  
vālmīkiruvāca / sanatkumāro niṣkāma avasadbrahmasadmani / vaikuṇṭhādāgato viṣṇustrailokyādhipatiḥ prabhuḥ // 	Valmiki replied: Sanat-kumara, who was devoid of desires, had been residing at the abode of Brahma, to which Vishnu, the Lord of the three worlds, was a visitor from Vaikuntha.  
brahmaṇā pūjitastatra salyalokanivāsibhiḥ / vinā kumāraṃ taṃ dṛṣṭrā hyuvāca prabhurīśvaraḥ // 	The Lord God was welcomed by all the inhabitants of the Brahmaloka as well as by Brahma himself, except by Sanat-kumara who was thus beheld and addressed to by the god.  
sanatkumāra stabdho'si niṣkāmo garvaceṣṭayā / atastvaṃ bhava kāmārtaḥ śarajanmeti nāmataḥ // 	“Sanat-kumar, it is ignorance that makes thee forsake thy desires for fear of regeneration (on earth), therefore must thou be born under the name of Sara-janma to be troubled with desires.”  
tenāpi śāpito viṣṇuḥ sarvajñatvaṃ tavāsti yat / kiṃcitkālaṃ hi tattyaktvā tvamajñānī bhaviṣyasi // 	Sanat-kumara in return denounced Vishnu by saying:—“Even all discerning as thou art, thou shalt have to sacrifice thine omniscience for some time, and pass as an ignorant mortal (on earth).”  
bhṛgurbhāryāṃ hatāṃ dṛṣṭrā hyuvāca krodhamūrcchitaḥ / viṣṇo tavāpi bhāryāyā viyogo hi bhaviṣyati // 	There was another anathema pronounced upon Vishnu by the sage Bhrigu, who seeing his wife killed (by him), became incensed with anger and said: “Vishnu thou shalt have also to be bereft of thy wife.”  
vṛndayā śāpito viṣṇuśchalanaṃ yattvayā kṛtam / atastvaṃ strīviyogaṃ tu vacanānmama yāsyasi // 	He was again cursed by Vrinda to be deprived of his wife, on account of his beguiling her.  
bhāryā hi devadattasya payoṣṇītīrasa~sthitā / nṛsiṃhaveṣadhṛgviṣṇuṃ dṛṣṭvā pañcatvamāgatā // 	Again when the pregnant wife of Deva-datta was killed (with fear) on seeing the man-lion figure of Vishnu;  
tena śapto hi nṛharirduḥkhārtaḥ strīviyogataḥ / tavāpi bhāryayā sārdhaṃ viyogo hi bhaviṣyati // 	The leonine Hari was denounced by the husband, who was sorely afflicted at the loss of his consort, to be thus separated from his wife also.  
bhṛguṇaivaṃ kumāreṇa śāpito devaśarmaṇā / vṛndayā śāpito viṣṇustena mānuṣyatāṃ gataḥ // 	Thus denounced by Bhrigu, by Sanat-kumara, Deva-datta and Vrinda, he was obliged (to be born in this earth) in the figure of a human being.  
etatte kathitaṃ sarve śāpavyājasya kāraṇam / idānīṃ vacmi tatsarve sāvadhānamatiḥ śṛṇu // 	I have thus explained to you the causes of all the imprecations (which were passed on Vishnu), and will now relate to you all other things which you shall have carefully to attend to.  
divi bhūmau tathākāśe bahirantaśca me vibhuḥ / yo vibhātyavabhāsātmā tasmai sarvātmane namaḥ // 	Salutation to the Lord, the universal soul, shining manifest in heaven, earth and the sky, and both within and without myself.  
vālmīkiruvāca / ahaṃ baddho vimuktaḥ syāmiti yasyāsti niścayaḥ / nātyantamajño nota jñaḥ so'smiñchāstre'dhikāravān // 	One convinced of his constraint (in this mortal world), and desiring his liberation from it, and, who is neither wholly ignorant of, nor quite conversant with divine knowledge, is entitled to (the perusal of) this work.  
kathopāyānvicāryādau mokṣopāyānimānatha / yo vicārayati prājño na sa bhūyo'bhijāyate // 	The wise man, who having well considered the narrative (of Rama) as the first step, comes afterwards to think on the means of liberation (as are expounded herein), he shall verily be exempt from transmigration.  
asminrāmāyaṇe rāmakathopāyānmahābalān / etāṃstu prathamaṃ kṛtvā purāhamarimardana // 	Know, O destroyer of thy enemies! that I have first embodied the history of Rama in this Ramayana.  
śiṣyāyāsmi vinītāya bharadvājāya dhīmate / ekāgro dattavāṃstasmai maṇimabdhirivārthine // 	And I have given the same to my attentive pupil the obedient and intelligent Bharadwaja, as the sea yields his gems to their seeker.  
tata ete kathopāyā bharadvājena dhīmatā / kasmiṃścinmerugahane brahmaṇo'gra udāhṛtāḥ // 	These historical preparatories were rehearsed by the learned Bharadwaja in the presence of Brahma, seated in a certain forest of the Sumeru Mountain.  
athāsya tuṣṭo bhagavānbrahmā lokapitāmahaḥ / varaṃ putra gṛhāṇeti tamuvāca mahāśayaḥ // 	"Then the lord Brahma, the great grandfather of the inhabitants (of the three worlds), was so highly pleased with him that he addressed him saying: ""Oh my son! ask the best boon that thou wishest for.""  "
bharadvāja uvāca / bhagavanbhūtabhavyeśa varo'yaṃ me'dya rocate / yeneyaṃ janatā duḥkhānmucyate tadudāhara // 	"Bharadwaja said:—""Oh thou lord, that art master of the past and future times, grant me the desired boon of communicating to me the means whereby people are liberated from their miseries.""  "
śrībrahmovāca / guruṃ vālmīkimatrāśu prārthayasva prayatnataḥ / tenedaṃ yatsamārabdhaṃ rāmāyaṇamaninditam // 	"Brahma said:—""Go ask diligently of thy preceptor Valmiki, to complete the faultless Ramayana that he has undertaken.  "
tasmiñchrute naro mohātsamagrātsaṃtariṣyati / setunevāmbudheḥ pāramapāraguṇaśālinā // 	By the hearing of which men will get over their manifold errors, in the same manner as they pass over the sea by the bridge built over it by the great Rama, who was fraught with all good qualities.  
śrīvālmīkiruvāca / ityuktvā sa bharadvājaṃ parameṣṭhī madāśramam / abhyāgacchatsamaṃ tena bharadvājena bhūtakṛt // 	Valmiki said:—Saying this to Bharadwaja, the supreme maker of all beings (Brahma) accompanied him to my hermitage.  
tūrṇaṃ saṃpūjito devaḥ so'rghyapādyādinā mayā / avocanmāṃ mahāsattvaḥ sarvabhūtahite rataḥ // 	In right earnest was the god welcomed by me with the argha and offerings of water and the like, when the lord of truth spoke to me for the good of all creatures.  
rāmasvabhāvakathanādasmādvaramune tvayā / nodvegātsa parityājya āsamāpteraninditāt // 	"Brahma spake to me saying said:—""Do not Oh sage! give up your undertaking until its final completion. No pains ought to be spared to make the history of Rama as faultless as it ought to be.  "
granthenānena loko'yamasmātsaṃsārasaṃkaṭāt / samuttariṣyati kṣipraṃ potenevāśu sāgarāt // 	By this work of yours men will forthwith pass over this hazardous world, in the same manner as one crosses the sea in a vessel.  
vaktuṃ tadevamevārthamahamāgatavānayam / kuru lokahitārthaṃ tvaṃ śāstramityuktavānajaḥ // 	"Again said the increate brahma to me said:—""I come to tell this very thing to you, that you complete the work for the benefit of mankind.""  "
mama puṇyāśramāttasmātkṣaṇādantarddhimāgataḥ / muhūrtābhyutthitaḥ proccaistaraṅga iva vāriṇaḥ // 	Then Oh king, the God disappeared from my sacred hermitage in a moment, just as the wave subsides in the water no sooner it has heaved itself.  
tasminprayāte bhagavatyahaṃ vismayamāgataḥ / punastatra bharadvājamapṛcchaṃ svasthayā dhiyā // 	I was struck with wonder at the disappearance of that (deity), and then being composed in my mind, I inquired of Bharadwaja, saying:—  
kimetadbrahmaṇā proktaṃ bharadvāja vadāśu me / ityuktena punaḥ proktaṃ bharadvājena tena me // 	Tell me, Bharadwaja, what Brahma spoke (to me) in the hermitage; to which he answered saying:—  
bharadvāja uvāca / etaduktaṃ bhagavatā yathā rāmāyaṇaṃ kuru / sarvalokahitārthāya saṃsārārṇavatārakam // 	The God commanded you to complete the Ramayana for the good of men, and as a means of their crossing over the gulf of the world.  
mahyaṃ ca bhagavanbrūhi kathaṃ saṃsārasaṃkaṭe / rāmo vyavahṛto hyasminbharataśca mahāmanāḥ // 	"Now Sir said Bharadwaja, ""explain to me how the great minded Rama and Bharata conducted themselves amidst the troubles of this world.  "
śatrughno lakṣmaṇaścāpi sītā cāpi yaśasvinī / rāmānuyāyinaste vā mantriputrā mahādhiyaḥ // 	"Tell me also how did Satrughna, Lakshmana, and the renowned Sita, and all those who followed Rama, as also the ministers and their highly intelligent sons, conduct themselves.  
nirduḥkhitāṃ yathaite nu prāptāstadbrūhi me sphuṭam / tathaivāhaṃ bhaviṣyāmi tato janatayā saha // 	Tell me clearly how they escaped all its miseries, that I may do the same with the rest of mankind: (for our salvation).""  "
bharadvājena rājendra vadetyukto'smi sādaram / tadā kartuṃ vibhorājñāmahaṃ vaktuṃ pravṛttavān // 	Being thus respectfully addressed by Bharadwaja, I was led, Oh great King! to carry out the behest of my lord (Brahma), and to narrate the Ramayana to him; saying:—  
śṛṇu vatsa bharadvāja yathāpṛṣṭaṃ vadāmi te / śrutena yena saṃmohamalaṃ dūre kariṣyasi // 	Hear my son Bharadwaja, I will tell you all that you have asked, and by the hearing of which you shall be enabled to cast away the dross of errors.  
tathā vyavahara prājña yathā vyavahṛtaḥ sukhī / sarvāsaṃsaktayā buddhyā rāmo rājīvalocanaḥ // 	You are wise and have to manage yourself in the manner of the felicitous and lotus-eyed Rama, with a mind free from (worldly) attachments,  
lakṣmaṇo bharataścaiva śatrughnaśca mahāmanāḥ / kausalyā ca sumitrā ca sītā daśarathastathā // 	(Know that) Lakshmana, Bharata, the great minded Satrughna, Kausalya, Sita, Sumitra as well as Dasaratha;—  
kṛtāstraścā'virodhaśca bodhapāramupāgatāḥ / vasiṣṭho vāmadevaśca mantriṇo'ṣṭau tathetare // 	With Kritastra and the two friends of Rama, and Vasishtha and Vamadeva, and the eight ministers of state as well as many others, had reached the summit of knowledge.  
dhṛṣṭirjayanto bhāsaśca satyo vijaya eva ca / vibhīṣaṇaḥ suṣeṇaśca hanumānindrajittathā // 	Their names are Dhrishta, Jayanta, Bhasa, Satya, Vijaya, Vibishanah, Sushena and Hanumana. And also Indrajita.

yadanādi yadakṣuṇṇaṃ yadapāyavivarjitam / tadānandasukhaṃ prāptaṃ mayā tvaddarśanānmune // 	Oh sage, I have felt at thine appearance the happiness which knows no bounds, and which has no diminution in it.  
adya vartāmahe nūnaṃ dhanyānāṃ dhuri dharmataḥ / bhavadāgamanasyeme yadvayaṃ lakṣyamāgatāḥ // 	This day we must be placed at the front rank of the fortunate, as we have become the object of thine advent.  
evaṃ prakathayanto'tra rājāno'tha maharṣayaḥ / āsaneṣu sabhāsthānamāsādya samupāviśan // 	With these and similar conversations that went on among the princes and the sages, they proceeded to the court-hall where they took their respective seats.  
sa dṛṣṭvā mālitaṃ lakṣmyā bhītastamṛṣisattamam / prahṛṣṭavadano rājā svayamarghyaṃ nyavedayat // 	The king finding the best of sages (Viswamitra) so very prosperous in his devotion, felt some hesitation to offer him the arghya (honorarium) himself with his cheerful countenance.  
sa rājñaḥ pratigṛhyārghyaṃ śāstradṛṣṭena karmaṇā / pradakṣiṇaṃ prakurvantaṃ rājānaṃ paryapūjayat // 	He (the sage) accepted the arghya offered him by the king, and hailed him during his act of turning round (the sage), according to the rules of Sastra.  
sa rājñā pūjitastena prahṛṣṭavadanastadā / kuśalaṃ cāvyayaṃ caiva paryapṛcchannarādhipam // 	Thus honoured by the king, he with a cheerful countenance asked the Lord of men about the good health (of himself and family), and the fulness of his finance.

kṣaṇaṃ yathārhamanyonyaṃ pūjayitvā sametya ca / te sarve hṛṣṭamanaso mahārājaniveśane // 	After their interview and exchange of due courtesies had lasted for a while to the satisfaction of all in the royal assembly;  
yathocitāsanagatā mithaḥ saṃvṛddhatejasaḥ / paraspareṇa papracchuḥ sarve'nāmayamādarāt // 	They both took their respective seats; when every one (in the court) respectfully greeted the sage of exalted prowess.  
upaviṣṭāya tasmai sa viśvāmitrāya dhīmate / pādyamarghyaṃ ca gāṃ caiva bhūyobhūyo nyavedayat // 	After the sapient sage (Viswamitra) was seated, they made various offerings of padya, arghya and kine to him.  
arcayitvā tu vidhivadviśvāmitramabhāṣata / prāñjaliḥ prayato vākyamidaṃ prītamanā nṛpaḥ // 	Having honoured Viswamitra in due form, the lord of men condescended to address him with a gladdest mind and in submissive terms, with his palms folded over each other.  
yathā'mṛtasya saṃprāptiryathā varṣamavarṣake / yathāndhasyekṣaṇaprāptirbhavadāgamanaṃ tathā // 	"He said, ""Sir, your coming here is as grateful to me as the obtaining of nectar by one, as a rainfall after a drought, and as the gaining of sight by the blind.  "
yatheṣṭadārasaṃparkātputrajanmā'prajāvataḥ / svapnadṛṣṭārthalābhaśca bhavadāgamanaṃ tathā // 	Again it is as delightful to me as the getting of a son by a childless man in his beloved wife, and coming in possession of a treasure in a dream.  
yathepsitena saṃyoga iṣṭasyāgamanaṃ yathā / praṇaṣṭasya yathā lābho bhavadāgamanaṃ tathā // 	Your advent is no less pleasing to me than one's meeting with the object of his wishes, the arrival of a friend, and the recovery of thing that was given for lost.  
yathā harṣo nabhogatyā mṛtasya punarāgamāt / tathā tvadāgamādbrahmansvāgataṃ te mahāmune // 	It gives me the joy that is derived from the sight of a deceased friend suddenly returning by the way of the sky. It is thus Oh Brahman, I welcome your visit to me.  
brahmalokanivāso hi kasya na prītimāvahet / mune tavāgamastadvatsatyameva bravīmi te // 	Who is there that is not glad to live in the heaven (Brahma-loka)? I feel myself as happy Oh sage! at your advent, and this I tell you truly.  
kaśca te paramaḥ kāmaḥ kiṃ ca te karavāṇyaham / pātrabhūto'si me vipra prāptaḥ paramadhārmikaḥ // 	(Now tell me) what is your best pleasure, and what I may do for you; O Vipra, that are the best of the virtuous, and most properly deserving of my services.  
pūrvaṃ rājarṣiśabdena tapasā dyotitaprabhaḥ / brahmarṣitvamanuprāptaḥ pūjyo'si bhagavanmayā // 	Formerly had you been famed under the title of Rajarshi (or royal sage); but since, made glorious by dint of your asceticism, you have been promoted to the rank of a Brahmarshi (or Brahman sage). Wherefore you are truly the object of my worship.  
gaṅgājalābhiṣekeṇa yathā prītirbhavenmama / tathā tvaddarśanātprītirantaḥ śītayatīva mām // 	I am so glad at your sight that it soothes my inmost soul, in the same manner as an ablution in Ganga's stream cheers the mind.  
vigatecchābhayakrodho vītarāgo nirāmayaḥ / idamatyadbhutaṃ brahmanyadbhavānmāmupāgataḥ // 	Free as you are from fears and desires, from wrath and passions and the feelings of pleasure, pain and disease, it is very wonderful, Oh Brahman, that you should have recourse to me.  
śubhakṣetragataṃ cāhamātmānamapakalmaṣam / candrabimba ivonmagnaṃ vedavedyavidāṃvara // 	I consider myself as situated at a holy sanctuary, and absolved from all my sins, or as merged in the lunar sphere (by your presence), Oh! best of the learned in the truths of the Vedas.  
sākṣādiva brahmaṇo me tavābhyāgamanaṃ matam / pūto'smyanugṛhītaśca tavābhyāgamanānmune // 	I understand your appearance as that of Brahma himself before me, and I confess myself, O sage! to be purified and favoured by your advent.  
tvadāgamanapuṇyena sādho yadanurañjitam / adya me saphalaṃ janma jīvitaṃ tatsujīvitam // 	I am indeed so gratified at your arrival, that I deem myself fortunate in this birth, and that I have not lived in vain but led a truly good life.  
tvāmihābhyāgataṃ dṛṣṭvā pratipūjya praṇamya ca / ātmanyeva namāmyantardṛṣṭvenduṃ jaladhiryathā // 	My heart cannot contain within itself, but overflows (with joy) like the sea at the sight of the moon, since I beheld your person here and made my respectful obeisance to you.  
yatkāryaṃ yena vārthena prāpto'si munipuṅgava / kṛtamityeva tadviddhi mānyo'sīti sadā mama // 	Whatever is your commission, and whatsoever may be the object, O greatest of sages! which has brought you hither, know it as already granted (by me); for your commands are always to be obeyed by me.  
svakārye na vimarśaṃ tvaṃ kartumarhasi kauśika / bhagavannāstyadeyaṃ me tvayi yatpratipadyate // 	You need not hesitate to communicate to me your best, O progeny of Kausika, there is nothing, with me which is to be kept from you, if you should ask for it.

śrīvālmīkiruvāca / tacchrutvā rājasiṃhasya vākyamadbhutavistaram / hṛṣṭaromā mahātejā viśvāmitro'bhyabhāṣata // 	After the illustrious Viswamitra had heard the aforesaid unusually lengthy speech of the lion among kings, his hairs stood erect with joy, and he said.  
sadṛśaṃ rājaśārdūla tavaivaitanmahītale / mahāvaṃśaprasūtasya vasiṣṭhavaśavartinaḥ // 	This speech is worthy of thee, O best of kings on earth, and one descended from a royal race, and guided by the sage Vasishtha himself.  
yattu me hṛdgataṃ vākyaṃ tasya kāryavinirṇayam / kuru tvaṃ rājaśārdūla dharmaṃ samanupālaya // 	Consider well O king about the performance of the act which I have in mind, and support (the cause of) virtue.

yadā yadā tu yajñena yaje'haṃ vibudhavrajān / tadā tadā tu me yajñaṃ vinighnanti niśācarāḥ // 	Whenever I betake myself to offer sacrifices (to the gods) at any place, instantly do these nocturnal demons appear to destroy my sacrificial rites.  
bahuśo vihite tasminmayā rākṣasanāyakāḥ / akiraṃste mahīṃ yāge māṃsena rudhireṇa ca // 	The chiefs of the Rakshasas fling heaps of flesh and blood on the sacrificial ground (before me), on very many occasions that I commence my ceremonies.  
avadhūte tathābhūte tasminyāgakadambake / kṛtaśramo nirutsāhastasmāddeśādupāgataḥ // 	Being thus obstructed in my sacrificial duties, I now come to thee from that spot and with a broken spirit, after having laboured in vain.

trātumarhasi māmārtaṃ śaraṇārthinamāgatam / arthināṃ yannirāśatvaṃ sattame'bhibhavo hi saḥ // 	Being thus oppressed I have recourse to thy protection, and thou shouldst protect me (from wrongs);otherwise it is an insult to solicitors to be put to disappointment by the best of men.  
tavāsti tanayaḥ śrīmāndṛptaśārdūlavikramaḥ / mahendrasadṛśo vīrye rāmo rakṣovidāraṇaḥ // 	Thou hast a son, the beauteous Rama, powerful as the fierce tiger, and strong as the great Indra himself. He it is who is able to destroy the Rakshasas.  
taṃ putraṃ rājaśārdūla rāmaṃ satyaparākramam / kākapakṣadharaṃ śūraṃ jyeṣṭhaṃ me dātumarhasi // 	Now mayst thou deliver to me that Rama thy eldest son, having his youthful locks of hair like the sable plumage of a crow, but possessing the true valour of a hero.  
śakto hyeṣa mayā gupto divyena svena tejasā / rākṣasā ye'pakartārasteṣāṃ mūrdhavinigrahe // 	Protected under my sacred authority, he will be able by his personal prowess, to sever the heads of the malicious Rakshasas.  
śreyaścāsya kariṣyāmi bahurūpamanantakam / trayāṇāmapi lokānāṃ yena pūjyo bhaviṣyati // 	I will do him an infinity of good services, whereby he will in the end become adored by the inhabitants of the three worlds.  
na ca te rāmamāsādya sthātuṃ śaktā niśācarāḥ / kruddhaṃ kesariṇaṃ dṛṣṭvā vaneraṇa ivaiṇakāḥ // 	The night-wandering Rakshasas cannot abide in the field before Rama, but must fly like stags in the wilderness before the furious lion.  
teṣāṃ na cānyaḥ kākutsthādyoddhumutsahate pumān / ṛte kesariṇaḥ kruddhānmattānāṃ kariṇāmiva // 	No other man than Rama can make bold to fight with the Rakshasas; as no animal other than the furious lion can stand to fight with the wild elephants.  
vīryotsiktā hi te pāpāḥ kālakūṭopamā raṇe / kharadūṣaṇayorbhṛtyāḥ kṛtāntāḥ kupitā iva // 	Elated with their strength these vicious beings have become (as deadly) as poisoned shafts in fighting, and being delegates of Khara and Dushana, they are as furious as death itself.  
rāmasya rājaśārdūla sahiṣyante na sāyakān / anāratagatā dhārā jaladasyeva pāṃsavaḥ // 	They cannot, Oh thou tiger among kings! be able to sustain the arrows of Rama, but must set down like the flying dust under the ceaseless showers of his arrows.  
na ca putrakṛtaṃ snehaṃ kartumarhasi pārthiva / na tadasti jagatyasminyanna deyaṃ mahātmanām // 	Let not paternal affection prevail over thee O king, (to withhold thy son), as there is nothing in this world, which the high-minded will refuse to part with.  
hanta nūnaṃ vijānāmi hatāṃstānviddhirākṣasān / nahyasmadādayaḥ prājñāḥ saṃdigdhe saṃpravṛttayaḥ // 	I know it for certain, and so shouldst thou know also, that the Rakshasas must be destroyed by him; and (believe me) that wise men like ourselves will never undertake to engage in an uncertainty.

nātyeti kālaḥ kālajña yathāyaṃ mama rāghava / tathā kuruṣva bhadraṃ te mā ca śoke manaḥ kṛthāḥ // 	Thou O son of Raghu, that knowest the times (of religious observances) must not allow my time to slip, so do as I may have Rama. Be blest and give not way to sorrow.  
kāryamaṇvapi kāle tu kṛtametyupakāratām / mahadapyupakāro'pi riktatāmetyakālataḥ // 	Even the smallest service appears to be much if done in good time, and the best service is of no avail if done out of season.  
ityevamuktvā dharmātmā dharmārthasahitaṃ vacaḥ / virarāma mahātejā viśvāmitro munīśvaraḥ // 	The illustrious and holy chief of the sages Viswamitra, paused after saying these words fraught with a virtuous and useful intention.  
śrutvā vaco munivarasya mahānubhāvastūṣṇīmatiṣṭhadupapannapadaṃ sa vaktum / no yuktiyuktakathanena vinaiti toṣaṃ dhīmānapūritamano'bhimataśca lokaḥ // 	Hearing these words of the great sage, the magnanimous king held his silence for some time, with a view to prepare a fitting answer; because no man of sense is ever satisfied with talking unreasonably either before others or to himself.  
aṣṭamaḥ sargaḥ vālmīkiruvāca / tacchrutvā rājaśārdūlo viśvāmitrasya bhāṣitam / muhūrtamāsīnniśceṣṭaḥ sadainyaṃ cedamabravīt // 	Valmiki added:—On hearing these words of Viswamitra, the tiger among kings remained speechless for a moment, and then besought him in the lowliness of his spirit.  
ūnaṣoḍaśavarṣo'yaṃ rāmo rājīvalocanaḥ / na yuddhayogyatāmasya paśyāmi saha rākṣasaiḥ // 	Rama my lotus-eyed boy is only of fifteen years of age. I do not see he is a match for the Rakshasas.  
iyamakṣauhiṇī pūrṇā yasyāḥ patirahaṃ prabho / tayā parivṛto yuddhaṃ dāsyāmi piśitāśinām // 	Here is a full akshauhini legion of my soldiers; of whom, Oh my Lord! I am the sole commander; surrounded by them I will offer battle to the Rakshasas cannibals.  
ime hi śūrā vikrāntā bhṛtyā mantraviśāradāḥ / ahaṃ caiṣāṃ dhanuṣpāṇirgoptā samaramūrdhani // 	Here are my brave generals who are well disciplined in warfare; I will be their leader in the height of war with my bow in hand.  
ebhiḥ sahaiva vīrāṇāṃ mahendramahatāmapi / dadāmi yuddhaṃ mattānāṃ kariṇāmiva kesarī // 	Accompanied with these, I can offer fight to the enemies of the gods, and to the great Indra himself, in the same manner as the lion withstands the wild elephants.  
bālo rāmastvanīkeṣu na jānāti balābalam / antaḥpurādṛte dṛṣṭā nānenānyā raṇāvaniḥ // 	Rama is but a boy who has no knowledge of the strength of our forces, and whose experience has scarcely stretched to the battle field beyond the inner apartments.  
na śastraiḥ paramairyukto na ca yuddhaviśāradaḥ / navāstraiḥ śūrakoṭīnāṃ tajjñaḥ samarabhūmiṣu // 	He is not well trained in arms, nor is he skilled in warfare. He does not know to fight with a foe, arrayed in the order of battle.  
kevalaṃ puṣpakhaṇḍeṣu nagaropavaneṣu ca / udyānavanakuñjeṣu sadaiva pariśīlanam // 	He only knows how to walk about in the gardens of this city and amidst the arbours and pleasant groves.  
vihartumeṣa jānāti saha rājakumārakaiḥ / kīrṇapuṣpopahārāsu svakāsvajirabhūmiṣu // 	He only knows how to play with his brother princes, in the flowery parks set apart for his play within the precincts of the palace.  
adya tvatitarāṃ brahmanmama bhāgyaviparyayāt / himeneva hi padmābhaḥ saṃpanno hariṇaḥ kṛśaḥ // 	Now a days, Oh Brahman! he has become by a sad reverse of my fortune, as lean and pale as the withering lotus under the dews.  
nāttumannāni śaknoti na vihartuṃ gṛhāvanim / antaḥkhedaparītātmā tūṣṇīṃ tiṣṭhati kevalam // 	He has no taste for his food, nor can he walk from one room to another, but remains ever silent and slow brooding over his inward grief and melancholy.  
sadāraḥ sahabhṛtyo'haṃ tatkṛte munināyaka / śaradīva payovāho nūnaṃ niḥsāratāṃ gataḥ // 	In my great anxiety about him, O chief of sages, I have been, with my family and dependants, deprived of the gist of our bodies, and become as empty clouds of autumn.  
īdṛśo'sau suto bāla ādhinā'tha vaśīkṛtaḥ / kathaṃ dadāmi taṃ tubhyaṃ yoddhuṃ saha niśācaraiḥ // 	Can my boy, so young as he is, and thus subjected to distemper, be fit to fight at all, and again with those marauders who rove about at nights.  
api bālāṅganāsaṅgādapi sādho sudhārasāt / rājyādapi sukhāyaiva putrasneho mahāmate // 	Oh thou high-minded sage! it is one's affection for his son that affords him far greater pleasure than his possession of a kingdom, or his connection with beauteous females, or even his relish for the juice of nectar.  
ye durantā mahārambhāstriṣu lokeṣu khedadāḥ / putrasnehena santo'pi kurvate tānasaṃśayam // 	It is from paternal affection that good people (engage to) perform the hardest duties and austerities of religion, and any thing which is painful in the three worlds.  
asavo'tha dhanaṃ dārāstyajyante mānavaiḥ sukham / na putro muniśārdūla svabhāvo hyeṣa jantuṣu // 	Men are even prepared under certain circumstances to sacrifice their own lives, riches and wives; but they can never sacrifice their children: this is the nature with all living beings.  
rākṣasāḥ krūrakarmāṇaḥ kūṭayuddhaviśāradāḥ / rāmastānyodhayatvitthaṃ yuktirevātiduḥsahā // 	The Rakshasas are very cruel in their actions and fight deceitful warfares: so that Rama should fight them, is an idea which is very painful to me.  
viprayukto hi rāmeṇa muhūrtamapi notsahe / jīvituṃ jīvitākāṃkṣī ca rāmaṃ netumarhasi // 	I that have a desire to live, cannot dare to live for a moment in separation from Rama; therefore thou shouldst not take him away.  
navavarṣasahasrāṇi mama jātasya kauśika / duḥkhenotpāditāstvete catvāraḥ putrakā mayā // 	I have O Kausika! passed nine thousand rains in my lifetime, ere these four boys were born to me after much austerity.  
pradhānabhūtasteṣveva rāmaḥ kamalalocanaḥ / taṃ vineha trayo'pyanye dhārayanti na jīvitam // 	The lotus-eyed Rama is the eldest of these without whom the three others can hardly bear to live.  
sa eva rāmo bhavatā nīyate rākṣasānprati / yadi tatputrahīnaṃ tvaṃ mṛtamevāśu viddhi mām // 	This Rama is going to be conveyed by thee against the Rakshasas; but when I am deprived of that son, know me certainly for dead.  
caturṇāmātmajānāṃ hi prītiratraiva me parā / jyeṣṭhaṃ dharmamayaṃ tasmānna rāmaṃ netumarhasi // 	Of my four sons he is the one in whom rests my greatest love. Therefore do not take away Rama—my eldest and most virtuous son from me.  
niśācarabalaṃ hantuṃ mune yadi tavepsitam / caturaṅgasamāyuktaṃ mayā saha balaṃ naya // 	If thy intention Oh sage, is to destroy the force of night wanderers, take me there accompanied by the four kinds (elephants, horse, chariots and foot soldiers) of mine army.  
kiṃvīryā rākṣasāste tu kasya putrāḥ kathaṃ ca te / kiyatpramāṇāḥ ke caiva iti varṇaya me sphuṭam // 	Describe to me clearly what these Rakshasas are, how strong they are, whose sons they be and what their size and figure.  
kathaṃ tena prakartavyaṃ teṣāṃ rāmeṇa rakṣasām / māmakairbālakairbrahmanmayā vā kūṭayodhinām // 	Tell me the way in which the Rakshasas are to be destroyed by Rama or my boys or by myself, when they are known to be treacherous in warfare.  
sarvaṃ me śaṃsa bhagavanyathā teṣāṃ mahāraṇe / sthātavyaṃ duṣṭabhāgyānāṃ vīryotsiktā hi rākṣasāḥ // 	Tell me all these, Oh great sage! that I can calculate the possibility of our making a stand against the fiercely disposed Rakshasas in the open field, when they are certainly so very powerful.  
śrūyate hi mahāvīryo rāvaṇo nāma rākṣasaḥ / sākṣādvaiśravaṇabhrātā putro viśravaso muneḥ // 	The Rakshasa named Ravana is heard as being very powerful, he is brother of Kuvera himself, and is the son of the sage Visravas.  
sa cettava makhe vighnaṃ karoti kila durmatiḥ / tatsaṃgrāme na śaktāḥ smo vayaṃ tasya durātmanaḥ // 	If it is he, the evil minded Ravana, that stands in the way of thy rites, we are unable to contend with that pest.  
kāle kāle pṛthagbrahmanbhūrivīryavibhūtayaḥ / bhūteṣvabhyudayaṃ yānti pralīyante ca kālataḥ // 	Power and prosperity in all their flourish come within the reach of the living at times, but they disappear at others.  
adyāsmiṃstu vayaṃ kāle rāvaṇādiṣu śatruṣu / na samarthāḥ puraḥ sthātuṃ niyatereṣa niścayaḥ // 	Now a days we are no match for such foes as Ravana and some others. Such is the decree of destiny.  
tasmātprasādaṃ dharmajña kuru tvaṃ mama putrake / mama caivālpabhāgyasya bhavānhi paradaivatam // 	Therefore, O thou, that art acquainted with law, do this favour to my son, (as not to take him away); unlucky as I am, it is thou that art the arbiter of my fate.  
devadānavagandharvā yakṣāḥ patagapannagāḥ / na śaktā rāvaṇaṃ yoddhuṃ kiṃ punaḥ puruṣā yudhi // 	The gods, and Asuras, the Gandharvas and Yakshas, the huge beasts, birds and serpents are unable to fight with Ravana: what are we human beings in arms to him.  
mahāvīryavatāṃ vīryamādatte yudhi rākṣasaḥ / tena sārdhaṃ na śaktāḥ sma saṃyuge tasya bālakaiḥ // 	That Rakshasa holds the prowess of the most powerful, we cannot afford to fight with him, nor even with his children.  
ayamanyatamaḥ kālaḥ pelavīkṛtasajjanaḥ / rāghavo'pi gato dainyaṃ yato vārdhakajarjaraḥ // 	This is a peculiar age in which good people are made powerless; I am moreover disabled by old age and want that spirit (that I was expected to possess) derived as I am from (the most powerful) race of the Raghus.  
athavā lavaṇaṃ brahmanyajñaghnaṃ taṃ madhoḥ sutam / kathayatvasuraprakhyaṃ naiva mokṣyāmi putrakam // 	Tell me O Brahmana! if it is Lavan the son of Madhu (the notorious Asura) that disturbs the sacrificial rites; in that case also I will not part with my son.  
sundopasundayoścaiva putrau vaivasvatopamau / yajñavighnakarau brūhi na te dāsyāmi putrakam // 	If it be the two sons of Sunda and Upasunda terrible as they are like the sons of the sun, that disturb your sacrifice, in that case also I will not give my son to thee.  
atha neṣyasi cedbrahmaṃstaddhato'smyahameva te / anyathā tu na paśyāmi śāśvataṃ jayamātmanaḥ // 	But after all, O Brahman, shouldest thou snatch him from me (by dint of the supernatural power that thou possessest), then I am also dead and gone with him. I do not see any other chance of a lasting success of thy devotion.  
ityuktvā mṛdu vacanaṃ raghūdvaho'sau kallole munimatasaṃśaye nimagnaḥ / nājñāsītkṣaṇamapi niścayaṃ mahātmā prodvīcāviva jaladhau sa muhyamānaḥ // 	Saying these gentle words, the descendant of Raghu was drowned in the sea of suspense with regard to the demand of the sage, but being unable to arrive at a conclusion, the great king was carried away by the current of his thoughts as one by the high waves of the sea.  
vālmīkiruvāca / tacchrutvā vacanaṃ tasya snehaparyākulekṣaṇam / samanyuḥ kauśiko vākyaṃ pratyuvāca mahīpatim // 	Valmiki said:—On hearing this speech of the king with his piteous look and eyes full of tears, the son of Kausika became highly incensed and replied.  
kariṣyāmīti saṃśrutya pratijñāṃ hātumarhasi / sa bhavānkesarī bhūtvā mṛgatāmiva vāñchasi // 	Thou art about to break thy promise after pledging thyself to its performance, and thus wishest to behave as a deer after having been a lion.  
rāghavāṇāmayukto'yaṃ kulasyāsya viparyayaḥ / na kadācana jāyante śītāṃśoruṣṇaraśmayaḥ // 	This is unbecoming of the race of Raghu, it is acting contrary (to the rules) of this great family. Hot rays must not proceed from the cool beamed moon.

bhoge'pyāyuṣi rājyeṣu mitre pitari mātari / paramudvegamāyātaścātako'vagrahe yathā // 	As the chataka (swallow) grows restless at the obstruction of rains (by hurricanes), so has Rama become impatient (under the restraint) of his father and mother, his friends and kingdom, his enjoyments and even his own life.  
iti toke samāyātāṃ śākhāprasaraśālinīm / āpattāmalamuddhartuṃ samudetu dayāparaḥ // 	Now in compassion on thy son, incline to root out this chagrin which like a noxious creeper has been spreading its branches.  
tasya tādṛksvabhāvasya samagravibhavānvitam / saṃsārajālamābhogi prabho prativiṣāyate // 	For notwithstanding his possession of all affluence, he looks upon the enjoyments of the world as his poison under such a disposition of his mind.

manasi mohamapāsya mahāmanāḥ sakalamārtitamaḥ kila sādhutām / saphalatāṃ nayatīha tamo haran dinakaro bhuvi bhāskaratāmiva // 	Who is there, that like the sun removing the darkness of the world by his rays, will remove the errors that have been the cause of grief in Rama's mind, and thereby make his generosity effectual in his case.  
viśvāmitra uvāca / evaṃ cettanmahāprājñā bhavanto raghunandanam / ihānayantu tvaritā hariṇaṃ hariṇā iva // 	Viswamitra said:—If such is the case, you who are intelligent, may go at once, and persuade that progeny of Raghu to come hither; as they do one deer by others.  
eṣa moho raghupaternāpadbhyo na ca rāgataḥ / vivekavairāgyavato bodha eva mahodayaḥ // 	This stupor of Rama is not caused by any (external) accident or (inward) affection; it is I think the development of that superior intellect which rises from the right reasoning of dispassionate men.  
ihāyātu kṣaṇādrāma iha caiva vayaṃ kṣaṇāt / mohaṃ tasyāpaneṣyāmo māruto'drerghanaṃ yathā // 	Let Rama come here for a while, and here shall we in a moment dispel the delusion (of his mind), as the wind drives away the clouds from the mountain-tops.  
etasminmārjite yuktyā mohe sa raghunandanaḥ / viśrāntimeṣyati pade tasminvayamivottame // 	After his hebetude is removed by my reasoning, he shall be enabled to repose in that happy state of mind, to which we have arrived.  
satyatāṃ muditāṃ prajñāṃ viśrāntimapatāpatām / pīnatāṃ varavarṇatvaṃ pītāmṛta ivaiṣyati // 	He shall not only attain to pure truth and a clear understanding of uninterrupted tranquility, but secure to himself a plumpness and beauteousness of his figure and complexion, as one derives from a potion of ambrosia.  
nijāṃ ca prakṛtāmeva vyavahāraparamparām / paripūrṇamanā mānya ācariṣyatyakhaṇḍitam // 	He will then attend with all his heart to the full discharge of the proper course of his duties without remission, which will redound to his honour.  
bhaviṣyati mahāsattvo jñātalokaparāvaraḥ / sukhaduḥkhadaśāhīnaḥ samaloṣṭāśmakāñcanaḥ // 	He will become strong with a knowledge of both worlds, and his exemption from the states of pleasure and pain, and then he will look upon gold and stones with an indifferent eye.  
ityukte munināthena rājā saṃpūrṇamānasaḥ / prāhiṇodrāmamānetuṃ bhūyo dūtaparamparām // 	After the chief of the sages had spoken in this manner, the king resumed the firmness of his mind, and sent heralds after heralds to bring Rama to him.  
etāvatātha kālena rāmo nijagṛhāsanāt / pituḥ sakāśamāgantumutthito'rka ivācalāt // 	By this very time Rama was preparing to rise from his seat in the palace to come over to his father, in the manner that the sun rises from the mountain in the east.

udāramāryamāpūrṇamantaḥkaraṇakoṭaram / avikṣubhitayā vṛttyā darśayantamanuttamam // 	The receptacle of his mind was filled by his magnanimity and honourable virtues, and the candour of his conduct showed him in the light of perfection.  
evaṅguṇagaṇākīrṇo dūrādeva raghūdvahaḥ / parimeyasmitācchācchasvahārāmbarapallavaḥ // 	Endowed with these various virtues and decorated by his necklace and fine apparel, Rama the support of Raghu's race, approached (his father) with a smiling countenance.  
praṇanāma calaccārucūḍāmaṇimarīcinā / śirasā vasudhākampaloladevācalaśriyā // 	He bowed his head to his father with the sparkling gems trembling in his locks, and imparting to his head the graceful appearance of the mountain Sumeru shaken by an earth-quake.

kiṃnāmedaṃ bata sukhaṃ yeyaṃ saṃsārasaṃtatiḥ / jāyate mṛtaye loko mriyate jananāya ca // 	What are these worldly pleasures good for, (thought I), and what means the multiplication (of our species) on earth? Men are born to die, and they die to be born again.  
asthirāḥ sarva eveme sacarācaraceṣṭitāḥ / āpadāṃ patayaḥ pāpā bhāvā vibhavabhūmayaḥ // 	There is no stability in the tendencies of beings whether movable or immovable. They all tend to vice, decay and danger; and all our possessions are the grounds of our penury.  
ayaḥśalākāsadṛśāḥ parasparamasaṅginaḥ / śliṣyante kevalaṃ bhāvā manaḥkalpanayā svayā // 	All objects (of sense) are detached from each other as iron rods or needles from one another; it is imagination alone which attaches them to our minds.  
manaḥsamāyattamidaṃ jagadābhogi dṛśyate / manaścāsadivābhāti kena sma parimohitāḥ // 	It is the mind that pictures the existence of the world as a reality, but the deceptiveness of the mind (being known) we are safe from such deception.  
asataiva vayaṃ kaṣṭaṃ vikṛṣṭā mūḍhabuddhayaḥ / mṛgatṛṣṇāmbhasā dūre vane mugdhamṛgā iva // 	If the world is an unreality, it is a pity that ignorant men should be allured by it, like the deer tempted by a distant mirage (appearing) as water.

evaṃ vimṛśato brahmansarveṣveva tato mama / bhāveṣvaratirāyātā pathikasya maruṣviva // 	Reasoning in this manner Oh Brahman, I came to be disgusted with the world, like a traveller in (his journey through) a desert.

bhṛśaṃ muhyāmi saṃsmṛtya bhāvābhāvamayīṃ sthitim / dāridryeṇeva subhago dūre saṃsāraceṣṭayā // 	I wait to think on the positive and negative states (of worldly bliss), as a ruined man bewails to reflect on his former state of affluence.  
mohayanti manovṛttiṃ khaṇḍayanti guṇāvalim / duḥkhajālaṃ prayacchanti vipralambhaparāḥ śriyaḥ // 	I take prosperity to be a seducing cheat, for its deluding the mind, impairing the good qualities (of men), and spreading the net of our miseries.

What mighty champions can we delegate (now) to fight with these than our knowledge of truth?  
trayodaśaḥ sargaḥ śrīrāma uvāca / iyamasminsthitodārā saṃsāre parikalpitā / śrīrmune parimohāya sāpi nūnaṃ kadarthadā // 	Rama said:—It is opulence, Oh sage! that is reckoned a blessing here; it is even she that is the cause of our troubles and errors.

cintāduhitaro bahvayo bhūridurlalitaidhitāḥ / cañcalāḥ prabhavantyasyāstaraṅgāḥ sarito yathā // 	Her daughters are anxieties fostered by many a malpractice, like the waves of a stream raised by the winds.  
eṣā hi padamekatra na nibadhnāti durbhagā / dagdhevāniyatācāramitaścetaśca dhāvati // 	She can never stand steady on her legs any where, but like a wretched woman who has burnt her feet, she limps from one place to another.

eṣā hi viṣamā duḥkhabhogināṃ gahanā guhā / ghanamohagajendrāṇāṃ vindhyaśailamahātaṭī // 	The rich are as inaccessible as the dark cavern of a dragon, and as unapproachable as the deep wilderness of the Vindhya mountain inhabited by fierce elephants.  
satkāryapadmarajanī duḥkhakairavacandrikā / sudṛṣṭidīpikāvātyā kallolaughataraṅgiṇī // 	Riches like the shadow of night, overcast the good qualities of men, and like moon-beams brings to bloom the buds of their misery.

saṃbhramābhrādipadavī viṣādaviṣavardhinī / kedārikā vikalpānāṃ khedāyabhayabhoginī // 	They bring upon us a cloud of fear and error, increase the poison of despondence and regret, and are like the dreadful snakes in the field of our choice.  
himaṃ vairāgyavallīnāṃ vikārolūkayāminī / rāhudaṃṣṭrā vivekendoḥ saujanyāmbhojacandrikā // 	Fortune is (as a killing) frost to the bondsmen of asceticism, and as the night to the owls of libertinism; she is an eclipse to the moonlight of reason, and as moonbeams to the bloom of the lilies of folly.  
indrāyudhavadālolanānārāgamanoharā / lolā taḍidivotpannadhvaṃsinī ca jaḍāśrayā // 	She is as transitory as the Iris, and alike pleasant to view by the play of her colours; she is as fickle as the lightning, which vanishes no sooner it appears to sight.

cāpalāvajitāraṇya nakulī nakulīnajā / vipralambhanatātparyajitogramṛgatṛṣṇikā // 	She is as unsteady as a well born damsel following a base-born man to the words; and like a (deceptive) mirage that tempts the run-aways to fall to it as the doe.  
laharīvaikarūpeṇa padaṃ kṣaṇamakurvatī / calā dīpaśikhevātidurjñeyagatigocarā // 	Unsteady as the wave, she is never steady in any place; (but is ever wavering to all sides) like the flickering flame of a lamp. So her leaning is known to nobody.  
siṃhīva vigrahavyagrakarīndrakulapothinī / khaḍgadhāreva śiśirā tīkṣṇatīkṣṇāśayāśrayā // 	She like the lioness is ever prompt in fighting, and like the leader of elephants favourable to her partizans. She is as sharp as the blade of a sword (to cut off all obstacles), and is the patroness of sharp-witted sharpers.  
nānayāpahṛtārthinyā durādhiparilīnayā / paśyāmyabhavyayā lakṣmyā kiṃcidduḥkhādṛte sukham // 	I see no felicity in uncivil prosperity, which is full of treachery, and replete with every kind of danger and trouble.  
dūreṇotsāritā'lakṣmyā punareva samādarāt / aho batāśliṣyatīva nirlajjā durjanā sadā // 	It is pity that prosperity, like a shameless wench will again lay hold on a man, after being abandoned by him in his association with (her rival) Poverty.  
manoramā karṣati cittavṛttiṃ kadarthasādhyā kṣaṇabhaṅgurā ca / vyālāvalīgātravivṛttadehā śvabhrotthitā puṣpalateva lakṣmīḥ // 	What is she with all her loveliness and attraction of human hearts, but momentary thing obtained by all manner of evil means, and resembling at best a flower shrub, growing out of a cave inhabited by a snake, and beset by reptiles all about its stem.  
śrīrāma uvāca / āyuḥ pallavakoṇāgralambāmbukaṇabhaṅguram / unmattamiva saṃtyajya yātyakāṇḍe śarīrakam // 	Human life is as frail as a pendant drop of water trembling on the tip of a leaflet; and as irrepressible as a raving madman, that breaks loose from its bodily imprisonment out of its proper season.  
viṣayāśīviṣāsaṅgaparijarjaracetasām / aprauḍhātmavivekānāmāyurāyāsakāraṇam // 	Again the lives of those whose minds are infected by the poison of worldly affairs, and who are incapable of judging for themselves, are (varily) but causes of their torment.  
ye tu vijñātavijñeyā viśrāntā vitate pade / bhāvābhāvasamāśvāsamāyusteṣāṃ sukhāyate // 	Those knowing the knowable, and resting in the all-pervading spirit, and acquiescing alike to their wants and gains, enjoy lives of perfect tranquility.  
vayaṃ parimitākārapariniṣṭhitaniścayāḥ / saṃsārābhrataḍitpuñje mune nāyuṣi nirvṛtāḥ // 	We that have certain belief of our being but limited beings, can have no enjoyment in our transient lives, which are but flashes of lightnings amidst the cloudy sky of the world.  
yujyate veṣṭanaṃ vāyorākāśasya ca khaṇḍanam / grathanaṃ ca taraṅgāṇāmāsthā nāyuṣi yujyate // 	It is as impossible to keep the winds in confinement, to tear asunder the sky to pieces, and wreathe the waves to a chaplet, as to place any reliance in our lives.  
pelavaṃ śaradīvābhramasneha iva dīpakaḥ / taraṅgaka ivālolaṃ gatamevopalakṣyate // 	Fast as the fleeting clouds in autumn, and short as the light of an oilless lamp, our lives appear to pass away as evanescent as the rolling waves in the sea.  
taraṅgaṃ pratibimbenduṃ taḍitpuñjaṃ nabhombujam / grahītumāsthāṃ badhnāmi na tvāyuṣi hatasthitau // 	Rather attempt to lay hold on the shadow of the moon in the waves, the fleeting lightenings in the sky, and the ideal lotus blossoms in the ether, than ever place any reliance upon this unsteady life.  
aviśrāntamanāḥ śūnyamāyurātatamīhate / duḥkhāyaiva vimūḍho'ntargarbhamaśvatarī yathā // 	Men of restless minds, desiring to prolong their useless and toilsome lives, resemble the she-mule conceiving by a horse.  
saṃsārasaṃsṛtāvasyāṃ pheno'sminsargasāgare / kāyavallayāmbhaso brahmañjīvitaṃ me na rocate // 	This world (Sansara) is as a whirlpool amidst the ocean of creation, and every individual body is as (evanescent) as a foam or froth or bubble, which can give me no relish in this life.  
prāpyaṃ saṃprāpyate yena bhūyo yena na śocyate / parāyā nirvṛteḥ sthānaṃ yattajjīvitamucyate // 	That is called true living, which gains what is worth gaining, which has no cause of sorrow or remorse, and which is a state of transcendental tranquility.  
taravo'pi hi jīvanti jīvanti mṛgapakṣiṇaḥ / sa jīvati mano yasya mananena na jīvati // 	There is a vegetable life in plants, and an animal life in beasts, and birds: man leads a thinking life, but true life is above (the succession of) thoughts.  
jātāsta eva jagati jantavaḥ sādhujīvitāḥ / ye punarneha jāyante śeṣā jaraṭhagardabhāḥ // 	All those living beings are said to have lived well in this earth, who being once born herein have no more to return to it. The rest are no better than old asses.  
bhāro'vivekinaḥ śāstraṃ bhāro jñānaṃ ca rāgiṇaḥ / aśāntasya mano bhāro bhāro'nātmavido vapuḥ // 	Knowledge is an encumbrance to the unthinking, and wisdom is cumbersome to the passionate; intellect—is a heavy load to the restless, and the body is a ponderous burden to one ignorant of his soul.  
rūpamāyurmano buddhirahaṃkārastathehitam / bhāro bhāradharasyeva sarvaṃ duḥkhāya durdhiyaḥ // 	A goodly person possessed of life, mind, intellect and self-consciousness and its occupations, is of no avail to the unwise, but seem to be his over-loadings as those upon a porter.  
aviśrāntamanāpūrṇamāpadāṃ paramāspadam / nīḍaṃ rogavihaṅgānāmāyurāyāsanaṃ dṛḍham // 	The discontented mind is the great arena of all evils, and the nestling place of diseases which alight upon it like birds of the air: such a life is the abode of toil and misery.  
pratyahaṃ khedamutsṛjya śanairalamanāratam / ākhuneva jaracchubhraṃ kālena vinihanyate // 	As a house is slowly dilapidated by the mice continually burrowing under it, so is the body of the living gradually corroded by the (pernicious) teeth of time boring within it.  
śarīrabilaviśrāntairviṣadāhapradāyibhiḥ / rogairāpīyate raudrairvyālairiva vanānilaḥ // 	Deadly diseases bred within the body, feed upon our vital breath, as poisonous snakes born in caves of the woods consume the meadow air.  
prasnuvānairavicchedaṃ tucchairantaravāsibhiḥ / duḥkhairāvṛścyate krūrairghuṇairiva jaraddrumaḥ // 	As the withered tree is perforated by minutest worms residing in them, so are our bodies continually wasted by many inborn diseases and noxious secretions.  
nūnaṃ nigaraṇāyāśu ghanagardhamanāratam / ākhurmārjārakeṇeva maraṇenāvalokyate // 	Death is incessantly staring and growling at our face, as a cat looks and purrs at the mouse in order to devour it.  
gandhādiguṇagarbhiṇyā śūnyayā'śaktiveśyayā / annaṃ mahāśaneneva jarayā parijīryate // 	Old age wastes us as soon as a glutton digests his food;and it reduces one to weakness as an old harlot, by no other charm than her paint and perfumes.  
dinaiḥ katipayaireva parijñāya gatādaram / durjanaḥ sujaneneva yauvanenāvamucyate // 	Youth forsakes us as soon, as a good man abandons his wicked friend in disgust, after his foibles come to be known to him in a few days.  
vināśasuhṛdā nityaṃ jarāmaraṇabandhunā / rūpaṃ khiṅgavareṇeva kṛtāntenābhilaṣyate // 	Death the lover of destruction, and friend of old age and ruin, likes the sensual man, as a lecher likes a beauty.  
sthiratayā sukhabhāsitayā tayā satatamujjñitamuttamaphalgu ca / jagati nāsti tathā guṇavarjitaṃ maraṇabhājanamāyuridaṃ yathā // 	Thus there is nothing so worthless in the world as this life, which is devoid of every good quality and ever subject to death, unless it is attended by the permanent felicity of emancipation.  
śrīrāma uvāca / mudhaivābhyutthito mohānmudhaiva parivardhate / mithyāmayena bhīto'smi durahaṃkāraśatruṇā // 	Rama continued:—Egoism springs from false conceit, and it is vanity (or vain glory) which fosters it; I am much afraid of this baneful egotism which is an enemy.  
ahaṃkāravaśādeva doṣakośakadarthatām / dadāti dīnadīnānāṃ saṃsāro vividhākṛtiḥ // 	It is under the influence of egotism that all men in this diversified world, and even the very poorest of them, fall into the dungeon of evils, and misdeeds.  
ahaṃkāravaśādāpadahaṃkārāhurādhayaḥ / ahaṃkāravaśādīhā tvahaṃkāro mamāmayaḥ // 	All accidents, anxieties, troubles and wicked exertions proceed from egoism or self-confidence; hence I deem egoism as a disease.  
tamahaṃkāramāśritya paramaṃ ciravairiṇam / na bhuje na pibāmyambhaḥ kimu bhogānbhuje mune // 	Being subject to that everlasting arch-enemy—the cynic egoism, I have refrained from my food and drink. What other enjoyment is there for me to partake of?  
saṃsārarajanī dīrghā māyā manasi mohinī / tato'haṃkāradoṣeṇa kirāteneva vāgurā // 	This world resembles a long continuous night, in which our egoism like a hunter, spreads the snare of affections.  
yāni duḥkhāni dīrghāṇi viṣamāṇi mahānti ca / ahaṃkārātprasūtāni tānyagātkhadirā iva // 	All our great and intolerable miseries, growing as rank as the thorny plants of the catechu, are but results of our egoism.  
śamendusaiṃhikeyāsyaṃ guṇapadmahimāśanim / sāmyameghaśaratkālamahaṃkāraṃ tyajāmyaham // 	It overcasts the equanimity of mind as an eclipse overshadows the moon; it destroys our virtues as a frost destroys the lotus flowers; it dispels the peace of men as the autumn drives away the clouds. I must therefore get rid of this egoistic feeling.  
nāhaṃ rāmo na me vāñchā bhāveṣu na ca me manaḥ / śānta āsitumicchāmi svātmanīva jino yathā // 	I am not Rama the prince, I have no desire nor should I wish for affluence; but I wish to have the peace of my mind and remain as the self-satisfied old sage Jina.  
ahaṃkāravaśādyadyanmayā bhuktaṃ hutaṃ kṛtam / sarvaṃ tattadavastveva vastvahaṃkārariktatā // 	All that I have eaten, done or offered in sacrifice under the influence of egoism, have gone for nothing; it is the absence of egoism which (I call) to be real good.  
ahamityasti cedbrahmannahamāpadi duḥkhitaḥ / nāsti cetsukhitastasmādanahaṃkāritā varam // 	So long, O Brahman! as there is (the feeling of) egoism in one, he is subject to sorrow at his difficulties; but being devoid of it, he becomes happy; hence it is better to be without it.  
ahaṃkāraṃ parityajya mune śāntamanastayā / avatiṣṭhe gatodvego bhogaugho bhaṅgurāspadaḥ // 	I am free from anxiety, O sage! ever since I have got the tranquility of my mind after giving up my (sense of) egoism; and known the transitoriness of all enjoyments.  
brahmanyāvadahaṃkāravāridaḥ parijṛmbhate / tāvadvikāsamāyāti tṛṣṇākuṭajamañjarī // 	As long, O Brahman! as the cloud of egoism overspreads (the region of our minds), so long our desires expand themselves like the buds of kurchi plants.  
ahaṃkāraghane śānte tṛṣṇā navataḍillatā / śāntadīpaśikhāvṛttyā kvāpi yātyatisatvaram // 	But when the cloud of egoism is dispersed, the lightning of avarice vanishes away, just as the lamp being extinguished, its light immediately disappears.  
ahaṃkāramahāvindhye manomattamahāgajaḥ / visphūrjati ghanāsphoṭaiḥ stanitairiva vāridaḥ // 	The mind vaunts with egoism, like a furious elephant in the Vindhyan hills, when it hears the thunder-claps in the clouds.  
iha dehamahāraṇye ghanāhaṃkārakesarī / yo'yamullasati sphārastenedaṃ jagadātatam // 	Again egoism residing like a lion in the vast forest of all human bodies, ranges about at large throughout the whole extent of this earth.  
tṛṣṇātantulavaprotā bahujanmaparamparā / ahaṃkārograkhiṅgena kaṇṭhe muktāvalī kṛtā // 	The self-conceited are decorated with a string of pearls about their necks, of which avarice forms the thread, and repeated births—the pearls.  
putramitrakalatrāditantramantravivarjitam / prasāritamaneneha mune'haṃkāravairiṇā // 	Our inveterate enemy of egoism, has (like a magician) spread about us the enchantments of our wives, friends and children, whose spells it is hard to break.  
pramārjite'hamityasminpade svayamapi drutam / pramārjitā bhavantyete sarva eva durādhayaḥ // 	As soon as the (impression of the) word (ego) is effaced from the mind, all our anxieties and troubles are wiped out of it.  
ahamityambude śānte śanaiśca śamaśātinī / manogaganasaṃmohamihikā kvāpi gacchati // 	The cloud of egoism being dispelled from the sky of our minds, the mist of error which it spreads to destroy our peace, will be dispersed also.  
nirahaṃkāravṛtterme maurkhyācchokena sīdataḥ / yatkiṃciducitaṃ brahmaṃstadākhyātumihārhasi // 	I have given up my (sense of) egoism, yet is my mind stupified with sorrow by my ignorance. Tell me, O Brahman! what thou thinkest right for me under these circumstances.  
sarvāpadāṃ nilayamadhruvamantarasthamunmuktamuttamaguṇena na saṃśrayāmi / yatnādahaṃkṛtipadaṃ parito'tiduḥkhaṃ śeṣeṇa māṃ samanuśādhi mahānubhāva // 	I have with much ado given up this egoism, and like no more to resort to this source of all evils and perturbation. It retains its seat in the breast for our annoyance only, and without benefiting us by any good quality of its own. Direct me now, you men of great understandings!  
śrīrāma uvāca / doṣairjarjaratāṃ yāti satkāryādāryasevanāt / vātāntaḥpicchalavavaccetaścalati cañcalam // 	Our minds are infested by evil passions and faults, and fluctuate in their observance of duty and service to superiors, as the plumes of a peacock fluttering at the breeze.  
itaścetaśca suvyagraṃ vyarthamevābhidhāvati / dūrāddūrataraṃ dīnaṃ grāme kauleyako yathā // 	They rove about at random with ardour and without rest from one place to another, like the poor village dog running afar and wide in quest of food.  
na prāpnoti kvacitkiṃcitprāptairapi mahādhanaiḥ / nāntaḥ saṃpūrṇatāmeti karaṇḍaka ivāmbubhiḥ // 	It seldom finds any thing any where, and happening even to get a good store some where, it is as little content with it as a wicker vessel filled with water.  
nityameva mune śūnyaṃ kadāśāvāgurāvṛtam / na mano nivṛtiṃ yāti mṛgo yūthādiva cyutaḥ // 	The vacant mind, Oh sage! is ever entrapped in its evil desires, and is never at rest with itself; but roves at large as a stray deer separated from its herd.  
taraṅgataralāṃ vṛttiṃ dadhadālūnaśīrṇatām / parityajya kṣaṇamapi hṛdaye yāti na sthitim // 	Human mind is of the nature of the unsteady wave, and as light as the minutest particle. It can therefore have no rest in spite of (the fickleness and levity of) its nature.  
mano mananavikṣubdhaṃ diśo daśa vidhāvati / mandarāhananoddhūtaṃ kṣīrārṇavapayo yathā // 	Disturbed by its thoughts, the mind is tossed in all directions, like the waters of the milk-white ocean when churned by the Mandara mountain.  
kallolakalitāvartaṃ māyāmakaramālitam / na niroddhuṃ samartho'smi manomayamahārṇavam // 	I can not curb my mind, resembling the vast ocean (in its course), and running with its huge surges (of the passions), with whirlpools (of error), and beset by the whales of delusion.  
bhogadūrvāṅkurākāṅkṣī śvabhrapātamacintayan / manohariṇako brahmandūraṃ viparidhāvati // 	Our minds run afar, O Brahman! after sensual enjoyments, like the deer running towards the tender blades of grass, and unmindful of falling into the pits.  
na kadācana me cetaḥ svāmālūnaviśīrṇatām / tyajatyākulayā vṛttyā cañcalatvamivārṇavaḥ // 	The mind can never get rid of its wavering state owing to the habitual fickleness of its nature, resembling the restlessness of the sea.  
cetaścañcalayā vṛttyā cintānicayacañcuram / dhṛtiṃ badhnāti naikatra pañjare kesarī yathā // 	The mind with its natural fickleness and restless thoughts, finds no repose at any place, as a lion (has no rest) in his prison-house.  
mano moharathārūḍhaṃ śarīrātsamatāsukham / haratyapahatodvegaṃ haṃsaḥ kṣīramivāmbhasaḥ // 	The mind seated in the car of delusion, absorbs the sweet, peaceful and undisturbed rest of the body, like the gander sucking up pure milk from amidst the water.  
analpakalpanātalpe vilīnāścittavṛttayaḥ / munīndra na prabudhyante tena tapye'hamākulaḥ // 	O chief of sages! I grieve much to find the faculties of the mind lying dormant upon the bed of imaginary delights, from which it is hard to waken them.  
kroḍīkṛtadṛḍhagranthitṛṣṇāsūtre sthitātmanā / vihago jālakeneva brahmanbaddho'smi cetasā // 	I am caught, O Brahman! like a bird in the net by the knots (of my egoism), and held fast in it by the thread of my avarice.  
saṃtatāmarṣadhūmena cintājvālākulena ca / vahnineva tṛṇaṃ śuṣkaṃ mune dagdho'smi cetasā // 	I burn in my mind, O sage, like the dried hay on fire, by the flame of my anxieties and under the spreading fumes of my impatience.  
krūreṇa jaḍatāṃ yātastṛṣṇābhāryānugāminā / śavaṃ kauleyakeneva brahmanmukto'smi cetasā // 	I am devoured, O Brahman! like a clod of cold meat, by the cruelty and greediness of my heart, as a carcase is swallowed by a hungry dog and its greedy mate.  
taraṅgataralāsphālavṛttinā jaḍarūpiṇā / taṭavṛkṣa ivaughena brahmannīto'smi cetasā // 	I am borne away, O sage! by the current of my heart, as a tree on the bank is carried away by the waters and waves beating upon it.  
avāntaranipātāya śūnye vā bhramaṇāya ca / tṛṇaṃ caṇḍānileneva dūre nīto'smi cetasā // 	I am led afar by my (greedy) mind, like a straw carried off by the hurricane, either to flutter in the air or fall upon the ground.  
saṃsārajaladherasmānnityamuttaraṇonmukhaḥ / setuneva payaḥpūro rodhito'smi kucetasā // 	My earthly mindedness has put a stop to my desire of crossing over the ocean of the world, as an embankment stops the course of the waters.  
pātālādgacchatā pṛthvīṃ pṛthvyāḥ pātālagāminā / kūpakāṣṭhaṃ kudāmneva veṣṭito'smi kucetasā // 	I am lifted up and let down again by the baseness of my heart, like a log of wood tied to a rope dragging it in and out of a well.  
mithyaiva sphārarūpeṇa vicārādviśarāruṇā / bālo vetālakeneva gṛhīto'smi kucetasā // 	As a child is seized by the false apparition of a demon, so I find myself in the grasp of my wicked mind, representing falsities as true.  
vahneruṣṇataraḥ śailādapi kaṣṭatarakramaḥ / vajrādapi dṛḍho brahmandurnigrahamanograhaḥ // 	It is hard to repress the mind, which is hotter than fire, more inaccessible than a hill, and stronger than a thunder bolt.  
cetaḥ patati kāryeṣu vihagaḥ svāmiṣeṣviva / kṣaṇena viratiṃ yāti bālaḥ krīḍanakādiva // 	The mind is attracted to its objects as a bird to its prey, and has no respite for a moment as a boy from his play.  
jaḍaprakṛtirālolo vitatāvartavṛttimān / mano'bdhirahitavyālo dūraṃ nayati tāta mām // 	My mind resembling the sea both in its dullness as well as restlessness, in its extent and fulness with whirlpools and dragons, keeps me far from advancing towards it.  
apyabdhipānānmahataḥ sumerūnmūlanādapi / api vahnyaśanātsādho viṣamaścittanigrahaḥ // 	It is more difficult to subdue the mind than to drink off the ocean, or to upset the Sumeru mountain. It is ever harder than the hardest thing.  
cittaṃ kāraṇamarthānāṃ tasminsati jagattrayam / tasminkṣīṇe jagatkṣīṇaṃ taccikitsyaṃ prayatnataḥ // 	The mind is the cause of all exertions, and the sensorium of the three worlds. Its weakness weakens all worldliness, and requires to be cured with care.  
cittādimāni sukhaduḥkhaśatāni nūnamabhyāgatānyagavarādiva kānanāni / tasminvivekavaśatastanutāṃ prayāte manye mune nipuṇameva galanti tāni // 	It is the mind from which arise our pains and pleasures by hundreds, as the woods growing in groups upon a hill; but no sooner is the scythe of reason applied to them, than they fall off one by one.  
sakalaguṇajayāśā yatra baddhā mahadbhistamarimiha vijetuṃ cittamabhyutthito'ham / vigataratitayāntarnābhinandāmi lakṣmīṃ jaḍamalinavilāsāṃ meghalekhāmivenduḥ // 	I am ready to subdue my mind which is my greatest enemy in this world, for the purpose of mastering all the virtues, which the learned say depend upon it. My want of desires has made me averse to wealth and the gross pleasures it yields, which are as tints of clouds tainting the (clear disk of the) moon.  
saptadaśaḥ sargaḥ śrīrāma uvāca / hārdāndhakāraśarvaryā tṛṣṇayeha durantayā / sphuranti cetanākāśe doṣakauśikapaṅkatayaḥ // 	I see our vices like a flock of owls flying about in the region of our minds, under the darkness of our affections, and in the longsome night of our avarice.  
antardāhapradāyinyā samūḍharasamārdavaḥ / paṅka ādityadīptyeva śoṣaṃ nīto'smi cintayā // 	I am parched by my anxieties like the wet clay under solar rays, infusing an inward heat in it by extraction of its soft moisture.  
mama cittamahāraṇyevyāmohatimirākule / śūnye tāṇḍavinī jātā bhṛśamāśāpiśācikā // 	My mind is like a vast and lonesome wilderness, covered under the mist of errors, and infested by the terrible fiend of desire is continually floundering about it.  
vacoracitanīhārā kāñcanopavanojjvalā / nūnaṃ vikāsamāyāti cintācaṇakamañjarī // 	My wailings and tears serve only to expand and mature my anxiety, as the dews of night open and ripen the blossoms of beans and give them a bright golden hue.  
alamantarbhramāyaiva tṛṣṇātaralitāśayā / āyātā viṣamollāsamūrmirambunidhāviva // 	Avarice by raising expectations in men, serves only to whirl them about, as the vortex of the sea wallows the marine animals in it.
