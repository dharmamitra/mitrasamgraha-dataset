The seat should be neither too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The yogī should then sit on it very firmly and practice yoga to purify the heart by controlling his mind, senses and activities and fixing the mind on one point.
samam kāya śiraḥ grīvam dhārayan acalam sthiraḥ samprekṣya nāsikā agram svam diśaḥ ca anavalokayan praśānta ātmā vigata bhīḥ brahmacāri vrate sthitaḥ manaḥ saṁyamya mat cittaḥ yuktaḥ āsīta mat paraḥ	One should hold one’s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose.

yathā dīpaḥ nivāta sthaḥ na iṅgate sā upamā smṛtā yoginaḥ yata cittasya yuñjataḥ yogam ātmanaḥ	As a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent Self.

This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.
saḥ niścayena yoktavyaḥ yogaḥ anirviṇṇa cetasā saṅkalpa prabhavān kāmān tyaktvā sarvān aśeṣataḥ manasā eva indriya grāmam viniyamya samantataḥ	One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with determination and faith and not be deviated from the path.

yataḥ yataḥ niścalati manaḥ cañcalam asthiram tataḥ tataḥ niyamya etat ātmani eva vaśam nayet	From wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self.
praśānta manasam hi enam yoginam sukham uttamam upaiti śānta rajasam brahma bhūtam akalmaṣam	The yogī whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest perfection of transcendental happiness.

sarva bhūta stham ātmānam sarva bhūtāni ca ātmani īkṣate yoga yukta ātmā sarvatra sama darśanaḥ	A true yogī observes Me in all beings and also sees every being in Me. Indeed, the self-realized person sees Me, the same Supreme Lord, everywhere.

cañcalam hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa pramāthi bala vat dṛḍham tasya aham nigraham manye vāyoḥ iva su duṣkaram	The mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Kṛṣṇa, and to subdue it, I think, is more difficult than controlling the wind.
śrī bhagavān uvāca asaṁśayam mahā bāho manaḥ durnigraham calam abhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyeṇa ca gṛhyate	Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa said: O mighty-armed son of Kuntī, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by suitable practice and by detachment.
asaṁyata ātmanā yogaḥ duṣprāpaḥ iti me matiḥ vaśya ātmanā tu yatatā śakyaḥ avāptum upāyataḥ	For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by appropriate means is assured of success. That is My opinion.

kaccit na ubhaya vibhraṣṭaḥ chinna abhram iva naśyati apratiṣṭhaḥ mahā bāho vimūḍhaḥ brahmaṇaḥ pathi	O mighty-armed Kṛṣṇa, does not such a man, who is bewildered from the path of transcendence, fall away from both spiritual and material success and perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?
etat me saṁśayam kṛṣṇa chettum arhasi aśeṣataḥ tvat anyaḥ saṁśayasya asya chettā na hi upapadyate	This is my doubt, O Kṛṣṇa, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for You, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.
śrī bhagavān uvāca pārtha na eva iha na amutra vināśaḥ tasya vidyate na hi kalyāṇa kṛt kaścit durgatim tāta gacchati	The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Son of Pṛthā, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.

atha vā yoginām eva kule bhavati dhī matām etat hi durlabha taram loke janma yat īdṛśam	Or [if unsuccessful after long practice of yoga] he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom. Certainly, such a birth is rare in this world.
tatra tam buddhi saṁyogam labhate paurva dehikam yatate ca tataḥ bhūyaḥ saṁsiddhau kuru nandana	On taking such a birth, he revives the divine consciousness of his previous life, and he again tries to make further progress in order to achieve complete success, O son of Kuru.
pūrva abhyāsena tena eva hriyate hi avaśaḥ api saḥ jijñāsuḥ api yogasya śabda brahma ativartate	By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles – even without seeking them. Such an inquisitive transcendentalist stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures.
prayatnāt yatamānaḥ tu yogī saṁśuddha kilbiṣaḥ aneka janma saṁsiddhaḥ tataḥ yāti parām gatim	And when the yogī engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, achieving perfection after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal.
tapasvibhyaḥ adhikaḥ yogī jñānibhyaḥ api mataḥ adhikaḥ karmibhyaḥ ca adhikaḥ yogī tasmāt yogī bhava arjuna	A yogī is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than the fruitive worker. Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yogī.

bhūmiḥ āpaḥ analaḥ vāyuḥ kham manaḥ buddhiḥ eva ca ahaṅkāraḥ iti iyam me bhinnā prakṛtiḥ aṣṭadhā	Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego – all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.
aparā iyam itaḥ tu anyām prakṛtim viddhi me parām jīva bhūtām mahā bāho yayā idam dhāryate jagat	Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.
etat yonīni bhūtāni sarvāṇi iti upadhāraya aham kṛtsnasya jagataḥ prabhavaḥ pralayaḥ tathā	All created beings have their source in these two natures. Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution.
mattaḥ para taram na anyat kiñcit asti dhanam jaya mayi sarvam idam protam sūtre maṇi gaṇāḥ iva	O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.

puṇyaḥ gandhaḥ pṛthivyām ca tejaḥ ca asmi vibhāvasau jīvanam sarva bhūteṣu tapaḥ ca asmi tapasviṣu	I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.
bījam mām sarva bhūtānām viddhi pārtha sanātanam buddhiḥ buddhi matām asmi tejaḥ tejasvinām aham	O son of Pṛthā, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.
balam bala vatām ca aham kāma rāga vivarjitam dharma aviruddhaḥ bhūteṣu kāmaḥ asmi bharata ṛṣabha	I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O lord of the Bhāratas [Arjuna].
ye ca eva sāttvikāḥ bhāvāḥ rājasāḥ tāmasāḥ ca ye mattaḥ eva iti tān viddhi na tu aham teṣu te mayi	Know that all states of being – be they of goodness, passion or ignorance – are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything, but I am independent. I am not under the modes of material nature, for they, on the contrary, are within Me.
tribhiḥ guṇa mayaiḥ bhāvaiḥ ebhiḥ sarvam idam jagat mohitam na abhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam	Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible.
daivī hi eṣā guṇa mayī mama māyā duratyayā mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etām taranti te	This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.

anta vat tu phalam teṣām tat bhavati alpa medhasām devān deva yajaḥ yānti mat bhaktāḥ yānti mām api	Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.

na tu mām śakyase draṣṭum anena eva sva cakṣuṣā divyam dadāmi te cakṣuḥ paśya me yogam aiśvaram	But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give you divine eyes. Behold My mystic opulence!

The form was decorated with many celestial ornaments and bore many divine upraised weapons. He wore celestial garlands and garments, and many divine scents were smeared over His body. All was wondrous, brilliant, unlimited, all-expanding.
divi sūrya sahasrasya bhavet yugapat utthitā yadi bhāḥ sadṛśī sā syāt bhāsaḥ tasya mahā ātmanaḥ	If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.

Yet I see this glowing form everywhere, adorned with various crowns, clubs and discs.

You are the ultimate resting place of all this universe. You are inexhaustible, and You are the oldest. You are the maintainer of the eternal religion, the Personality of Godhead. This is my opinion.
anādi madhya antam ananta vīryam ananta bāhum śaśi sūrya netram paśyāmi tvām dīpta hutāśa vaktram sva tejasā viśvam idam tapantam	You are without origin, middle or end. Your glory is unlimited.

You are fire, You are water, and You are the moon! You are Brahmā, the first living creature, and You are the great-grandfather. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You a thousand times, and again and yet again!

Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonored You many times, jesting as we relaxed, lay on the same bed, or sat or ate together, sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many friends. O infallible one, please excuse me for all those offenses.
pitā asi lokasya cara acarasya tvam asya pūjyaḥ ca guruḥ garīyān na tvat samaḥ asti abhyadhikaḥ kutaḥ anyaḥ loka traye api apratima prabhāva	You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, of the moving and the nonmoving. You are its worshipable chief, the supreme spiritual master. No one is greater than You, nor can anyone be one with You. How then could there be anyone greater than You within the three worlds, O Lord of immeasurable power?
tasmāt praṇamya praṇidhāya kāyam prasādaye tvām aham īśam īḍyam pitā iva putrasya sakhā iva sakhyuḥ priyaḥ priyāyāḥ arhasi deva soḍhum	You are the Supreme Lord, to be worshiped by every living being. Thus I fall down to offer You my respectful obeisances and ask Your mercy. As a father tolerates the impudence of his son, a friend the impertinence of a friend, or a husband the familiarity of his wife, please tolerate the wrongs I may have done You.
