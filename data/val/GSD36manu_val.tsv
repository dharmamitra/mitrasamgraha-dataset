manum ekāgram āsīnam abhigamya maharṣayaḥ / pratipūjya yathānyāyam idaṃ vacanam abruvan //	The great sages approached Manu, who was seated with a collected mind, and, having duly worshipped him, spoke as follows:
bhagavan sarvavarṇānāṃ yathāvad anupūrvaśaḥ / antaraprabhavānāṃ ca dharmān no vaktum arhasi //	'Deign, divine one, to declare to us precisely and in due order the sacred laws of each of the (four chief) castes (varna) and of the intermediate ones.
tvam eko hy asya sarvasya vidhānasya svayaṃbhuvaḥ / acintyasyāprameyasya kāryatattvārthavit prabho //	'For thou, O Lord, alone knowest the purport, (i.e.) the rites, and the knowledge of the soul, (taught) in this whole ordinance of the Self-existent (Svayambhu), which is unknowable and unfathomable.'
sa taiḥ pṛṣṭas tathā samyag amitaujā mahātmabhiḥ / pratyuvācārcya tān sarvān maharṣīñ śrūyatām iti //	He, whose power is measureless, being thus asked by the high-minded great sages, duly honoured them, and answered, 'Listen!'
āsīd idaṃ tamobhūtam aprajñātam alakṣaṇam / apratarkyam avijñeyaṃ prasuptam iva sarvataḥ //	This (universe) existed in the shape of Darkness, unperceived, destitute of distinctive marks, unattainable by reasoning, unknowable, wholly immersed, as it were, in deep sleep.
tataḥ svayaṃbhūr bhagavān avyakto vyañjayann idam / mahābhūtādi vṛttaujāḥ prādur āsīt tamonudaḥ //	Then the divine Self-existent (Svayambhu, himself) indiscernible, (but) making (all) this, the great elements and the rest, discernible, appeared with irresistible (creative) power, dispelling the darkness.
yo 'sāv atīndriyagrāhyaḥ sūkṣmo 'vyaktaḥ sanātanaḥ / sarvabhūtamayo 'cintyaḥ sa eva svayam udbabhau //	He who can be perceived by the internal organ (alone), who is subtile, indiscernible, and eternal, who contains all created beings and is inconceivable, shone forth of his own (will).
so 'bhidhyāya śarīrāt svāt sisṛkṣur vividhāḥ prajāḥ / apa eva sasarjādau tāsu vīryam avāsṛjat //	He, desiring to produce beings of many kinds from his own body, first with a thought created the waters, and placed his seed in them.
tad aṇḍam abhavad dhaimaṃ sahasrāṃśusamaprabham / tasmiñ jajñe svayaṃ brahmā sarvalokapitāmahaḥ //	That (seed) became a golden egg, in brilliancy equal to the sun; in that (egg) he himself was born as Brahman, the progenitor of the whole world.
āpo narā iti proktā āpo vai narasūnavaḥ / tā yad asyāyanaṃ pūrvaṃ tena nārāyaṇaḥ smṛtaḥ //	The waters are called narah, (for) the waters are, indeed, the offspring of Nara; as they were his first residence (ayana), he thence is named Narayana.
yat tat kāraṇam avyaktaṃ nityaṃ sadasadātmakaṃ / tadvisṛṣṭaḥ sa puruṣo loke brahmeti kīrtyate //	From that (first) cause, which is indiscernible, eternal, and both real and unreal, was produced that male (Purusha), who is famed in this world (under the appellation of) Brahman.
tasminn aṇḍe sa bhagavān uṣitvā parivatsaram / svayam evātmano dhyānāt tad aṇḍam akarod dvidhā //	The divine one resided in that egg during a whole year, then he himself by his thought (alone) divided it into two halves;
tābhyāṃ sa śakalābhyāṃ ca divaṃ bhūmiṃ ca nirmame / madhye vyoma diśaś cāṣṭāv apāṃ sthānaṃ ca śāśvataṃ //	And out of those two halves he formed heaven and earth, between them the middle sphere, the eight points of the horizon, and the eternal abode of the waters.
udbabarhātmanaś caiva manaḥ sadasadātmakam / manasaś cāpy ahaṃkāram abhimantāram īśvaram //	From himself (atmanah) he also drew forth the mind, which is both real and unreal, likewise from the mind egoism, which possesses the function of self-consciousness (and is) lordly;

teṣāṃ tv avayavān sūkṣmān ṣaṇṇām apy amitaujasām / saṃniveśyātmamātrāsu sarvabhūtāni nirmame //	But, joining minute particles even of those six, which possess measureless power, with particles of himself, he created all beings.
yan mūrtyavayavāḥ sūkṣmās tānīmāny āśrayanti ṣaṭ / tasmāc charīram ity āhus tasya mūrtiṃ manīṣiṇaḥ //	Because those six (kinds of) minute particles, which form the (creator's) frame, enter (a-sri) these (creatures), therefore the wise call his frame sarira, (the body.)
tad āviśanti bhūtāni mahānti saha karmabhiḥ / manaś cāvayavaiḥ sūkṣmaiḥ sarvabhūtakṛd avyayam //	That the great elements enter, together with their functions and the mind, through its minute parts the framer of all beings, the imperishable one.
teṣām idaṃ tu saptānāṃ puruṣāṇāṃ mahaujasām / sūkṣmābhyo mūrtimātrābhyaḥ saṃbhavaty avyayād vyayam //	But from minute body (-framing) particles of these seven very powerful Purushas springs this (world), the perishable from the imperishable.
ādyādyasya guṇaṃ tv eṣām avāpnoti paraḥ paraḥ / yo yo yāvatithaś caiṣāṃ sa sa tāvad guṇaḥ smṛtaḥ //	Among them each succeeding (element) acquires the quality of the preceding one, and whatever place (in the sequence) each of them occupies, even so many qualities it is declared to possess.
sarveṣāṃ tu sa nāmāni karmāṇi ca pṛthak pṛthak / vedaśabdebhya evādau pṛthak saṃsthāś ca nirmame //	But in the beginning he assigned their several names, actions, and conditions to all (created beings), even according to the words of the Veda.
karmātmanāṃ ca devānāṃ so 'sṛjat prāṇināṃ prabhuḥ / sādhyānāṃ ca gaṇaṃ sūkṣmaṃ yajñaṃ caiva sanātanam //	He, the Lord, also created the class of the gods, who are endowed with life, and whose nature is action; and the subtile class of the Sadhyas, and the eternal sacrifice.
agnivāyuravibhyas tu trayaṃ brahma sanātanam / dudoha yajñasiddhyartham ṛgyajuḥsāmalakṣaṇam //	But from fire, wind, and the sun he drew forth the threefold eternal Veda, called Rik, Yagus, and Saman, for the due performance of the sacrifice.
kālaṃ kālavibhaktīś ca nakṣatrāṇi grahāṃs tathā / saritaḥ sāgarāñ śailān samāni viṣamāni ca //	Time and the divisions of time, the lunar mansions and the planets, the rivers, the oceans, the mountains, plains, and uneven ground.
tapo vācaṃ ratiṃ caiva kāmaṃ ca krodham eva ca / sṛṣṭiṃ sasarja caivemāṃ sraṣṭum icchann imāḥ prajāḥ //	Austerity, speech, pleasure, desire, and anger, this whole creation he likewise produced, as he desired to call these beings into existence.
karmaṇāṃ ca vivekārthaṃ dharmādharmau vyavecayat / dvandvair ayojayac cemāḥ sukhaduḥkhādibhiḥ prajāḥ //	Moreover, in order to distinguish actions, he separated merit from demerit, and he caused the creatures to be affected by the pairs (of opposites), such as pain and pleasure.
aṇvyo mātrā vināśinyo daśārdhānāṃ tu yāḥ smṛtāḥ / tābhiḥ sārdham idaṃ sarvaṃ saṃbhavaty anupūrvaśaḥ //	But with the minute perishable particles of the five (elements) which have been mentioned, this whole (world) is framed in due order.
yaṃ tu karmaṇi yasmin sa nyayuṅkta prathamaṃ prabhuḥ / sa tad eva svayaṃ bheje sṛjyamānaḥ punaḥ punaḥ //	But to whatever course of action the Lord at first appointed each (kind of beings), that alone it has spontaneously adopted in each succeeding creation.
hiṃsrāhiṃsre mṛdukrūre dharmādharmāv ṛtānṛte / yad yasya so 'dadhāt sarge tat tasya svayam āviśat //	Whatever he assigned to each at the (first) creation, noxiousness or harmlessness, gentleness or ferocity, virtue or sin, truth or falsehood, that clung (afterwards) spontaneously to it.
yathā rtuliṅgāny ṛtavaḥ svayam eva rtuparyaye / svāni svāny abhipadyante tathā karmāṇi dehinaḥ //	As at the change of the seasons each season of its own accord assumes its distinctive marks, even so corporeal beings (resume in new births) their (appointed) course of action.
lokānāṃ tu vivṛddhyarthaṃ mukhabāhūrupādataḥ / brāhmaṇaṃ kṣatriyaṃ vaiśyaṃ śūdraṃ ca niravartayat //	But for the sake of the prosperity of the worlds he caused the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra to proceed from his mouth, his arms, his thighs, and his feet.
dvidhā kṛtvātmano deham ardhena puruṣo 'bhavat / ardhena nārī tasyāṃ sa virājam asṛjat prabhuḥ // tapas taptvāsṛjad yaṃ tu sa svayaṃ puruṣo virāṭ / taṃ māṃ vittāsya sarvasya sraṣṭāraṃ dvijasattamāḥ //	Dividing his own body, the Lord became half male and half female; with that (female) he produced Virag. But know me, O most holy among the twice-born, to be the creator of this whole (world), whom that male, Virag, himself produced, having performed austerities.
ahaṃ prajāḥ sisṛkṣus tu tapas taptvā suduścaram / patīn prajānām asṛjaṃ maharṣīn ādito daśa //	Then I, desiring to produce created beings, performed very difficult austerities, and (thereby) called into existence ten great sages, lords of created beings,
marīcim atryaṅgirasau pulastyaṃ pulahaṃ kratum / pracetasaṃ vasiṣṭhaṃ ca bhṛguṃ nāradam eva ca //	Mariki, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Praketas, Vasishtha, Bhrigu, and Narada.

dātṝn pratigrahītṝṃś ca kurute phalabhāginaḥ / viduṣe dakṣiṇāṃ dattvā vidhivat pretya ceha ca //	But a present made in accordance with the rules to a learned man, makes the giver and the recipient partakers of rewards both in this (life) and after death.
