For the sacrifice is a work: hence, in saying 'for the work you two,' he says, 'for the sacrifice.' And 'for pervasion you two,' he says,because he, as it were, pervades (goes through, accomplishes) the sacrifice. He then restrains his speech; for (restrained) speech means undisturbed sacrifice; so that (in so doing) he thinks: 'May I accomplish the sacrifice!' He now heats (the two objects on the Gârhapatya), with the formula : 'Scorched is the Rakshas, scorched are the enemies!' or : 'Burnt out is the Rakshas, burnt out are the enemies!'
etaddhavai devā vrataṃ caranti yatsatyaṃ tasmātte yaśo yaśo ha bhavati ya evaṃ vidvāṃtsatyaṃvadati // atha saṃsthite visṛjate /	For the gods, when they were performing the sacrifice, were afraid of a disturbance on the part of the Asuras and Rakshas: hence by this means he expels from here, at the very opening of the sacrifice, the evil spirits, the Rakshas.

For the Rakshas roams about in the air, rootless and unfettered in both directions (below and above); and in order that this man (the Adhvaryu) may move about the air, rootless and unfettered in both directions, he by this very prayer renders the atmosphere free from danger and evil spirits.
sa āhavanīyāgāre vaitāṃ rātrīṃ śayīta /	It is from the cart that he should take (the rice required for the sacrifice).
gārhapatyāgāre vā devānvā eṣa upāvartate yo vratamupaiti sa yānevopāvarttate teṣāmevaitanmadhye śete 'dhaḥ śayītādhastādiva hi śreyasa upacāraḥ //	For at first the cart (is the receptacle of the rice) and afterwards this halland because he thinks 'what was at first (in the cart, and hence still unimpaired by entering the householder's abode), that I will operate upon;' for that reason let him take (rice) from the cart.
yadvevāpaḥ praṇayati / adbhirvā idaṃ sarvamāptaṃ tatprathamenaivaitatkarmaṇā sarvamāpnoti // yadvevāsyātra /	Moreover, the cart represents an abundance; for the cart does indeed represent an abundance: hence, when there is much of anything, people say that there are 'cart-loads' of it.
tā utsicyottareṇa gārhapatyaṃ sādayati /	Thus he thereby approaches an abundance, and for this reason he should take from the cart.
gṛhā vai gārhapatyo gṛhā vai pratiṣṭhāyām pratitiṣṭhati tatho hainameṣa vajro na hinasti tasmādgārhapatye sādayati //	The cart further is (one of the means of) the sacrifice; for the cart is indeed (one of the means of) sacrifice. To the cart, therefore, refer the (following) Yagus-texts, and not to a store-room, nor to a jar.
yoṣā vā āpo vṛbṣāgnirmithunamevaitatprajananaṃ kriyata evamiva hi mithunaṃ kLptamuttarato hi strī pumāṃsamupaśete //	The Rishis, it is true, once took (the rice) from a leathern bag, and hence, in the case of the Rishis, the Yagus-texts applied to a leathern bag.
tā nāntareṇa saṃcareyuḥ /	Here, however, they are taken in their natural application.
karmaṇo vāṃ veṣāya vāmiti yajño vai karma yajñāya hi tasmādāha karmaṇo vāmiti veṣāya vāmiti veveṣṭīva hi yajñam //	Because he thinks 'from (or, by means of) the sacrifice I will perform the sacrifice,' let him, therefore, take (rice) from the cart.
sa vā anasa eva gṛhṇīyāt /	Some do indeed take it from a (wooden) jar.
uto pātryai gṛāmu tarhyavastadupohya gṛhṇīyādyato yunajāma tato vimuñccanti //	In that case also he should mutter the Yagus-texts without omitting any; and let him in that case take (the rice) after inserting the wooden sword under[paragraph continues] (the jar).
tasya vā etasyānasaḥ /	He does so, thinking 'where we want to yoke, there we unyoke;' for from the same place where they yoke, they also unyoke.
agnireva dhūragnirhi vai dhūratha ya enadvahantyagnidagdhamivaiṣāṃ vaham bhavatyatha yajjaghanena kastambhīm pra ugaṃ vedirevāsya sā nīḍa eva havirdhānam //	(Like) fire, verily, is the yoke of that very cart; for the yoke is indeed (like) fire: hence the shoulder of those (oxen) that draw this (cart) becomes as if burnt by fire. The middle part of the pole behind the prop represents, as it were, its (the cart's) altar ; and the enclosed space of the cart (which contains the rice) constitutes its havirdhânam (receptacle of the sacrificial food) .
dhūrasi dhūrva dhūrvantaṃ dhūrva taṃ yo 'smāndhūrvati taṃ dhūrvayaṃ vayaṃ dhūrvāma ityagnirvā eṣa dhuryastametadatyeṣyanbhavati havirgrahiṣyaṃstasmāevaitānnihnute tatho haitameṣo 'tiyantamagnirdhuryo na hinasti //	He now touches the yoke, with the text : 'Thou art the yoke (dhur); injure (dhûrv) thou the injurer! injure him that injures us! injure him whom we injure!' For there being a fire in the yoke by which he will have to pass when he fetches the material for the oblation, he thereby propitiates it, and thus that fire in the yoke does not injure him when he passes by.
adharmāsaśo vā ahaṃ sapatnāndhūrvāmītyetaddha sma sa tadabhyāha //	Here now Âruni said: 'Every half-moon I destroy the enemies.' This he said with reference to this point.

'Thou art unbent, the receptacle of oblations; be thou firm, waver not!' Thus he eulogises the cart, hoping that he may obtain the oblation from the one thus eulogised and pleased. He adds , 'May thy Lord of Sacrifice not waver!' for Lord of Sacrifice is the sacrificer, and it is for the sacrificer, therefore, that he thus prays for firmness.
viṣṇustvā kramatāmiti yajño vai viṣṇuḥ sa devebhya imāṃ vikrāntiṃ vicakrame yaiṣāmiyaṃ vikrāntiridameva prathamena padena paspārāthedamantarikṣaṃ dvitīyena divamuttamenaitāmvevaiṣa etasmai viṣṇuryajño vikrāntiṃ vikramate //	He now ascends (the cart by the southern wheel), with the text : 'May Vishnu ascend thee!' For Vishnu is the sacrifice; by striding (vi-kram) he obtained for the gods this all-pervading power (vikrânti) which now belongs to them. By his first step he gained this very (earth), by the second the aërial expanse, and by the last step the sky. And this very same pervading power Vishnu, as sacrifice, by his strides obtains for him (the sacrificer).
atha prekṣate / uru vātāyeti prāṇo vai vātastadbrahmaṇaiv aitatprāṇāya vātāyorugāyaṃ kurute // athāpāsyati /	He then looks (at the rice) and (addressing the cart) mutters : 'Wide open (bethou) to the wind!' For wind means breath; so that by this prayer he effects free scope for the air of the (sacrificer's) breath.
apahataṃ rakṣa iti yadyatra kiñcidāpannam bhavati yadyu nābhyeva mṛśettannāṣṭrā evaitadrakṣāṃ syato 'pahanti // athābhipadyate /	With the text , 'Repelled is the Rakshas!' he then throws away whatever (grass, &c.) may have fallen on it. But if nothing (have fallen on it), let him merely touch it. He thereby drives away from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas.
yacantām pañcati pañca vā imā aṅgulayaḥ pāṅkto vai yajñastadyajñamevaitadatra dadhāti // atha gṛhṇāti /	He touches (the rice), with the text , 'Let the five take!' for five are these fingers, and fivefold also is the sacrifice ; so that he thereby puts the sacrifice on it (the cart).
devasya tvā savituḥ prasave 'śvinorbāhubhyām pūṣṇo hastābhyām agnaye juṣṭaṃ gṛhṇāmīti savitā vai devānām prasavitā tatsavitṛprasūta evaitadgṛhṇātyaśvinorbāhubhyāmityaśvināvadhvaryū pūṣṇo hastābhyāmiti pūṣā bhāgadugho 'śanam pāṇibhyāmupanidhātā satyaṃ devā antammanuṣyāstatsatyenaivaitadgṛhṇāti //	He then takes (the rice), with the text : 'At the impulse (prasavana) of the divine Savitri, I take thee with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan, thee, agreeable to Agni!' For Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods: therefore he takes this as one impelled by Savitri. 'With the arms of the Asvins,' he says, because the two Asvins are the Adhvaryu priests (of the gods). 'With the hands of Pûshan,' he says, because Pûshan is distributer of portions (to the gods), who with his own hands places the food before them.
atha devatāyā ādiśati /	He now announces (the oblation) to the deity (for whom it is intended).
sarvā ha vai devatā adhvaryuṃ havirgṛhīṣyantamupatiṣṭhante mama nāma grahīṣyati mama nāma grahīṣyatīti tābhya evaitatsaha satībhyo 'samadaṃ karoti //	For when the Adhvaryu is about to take the oblation, all the gods draw near to him, thinking, 'My name he will choose! my name he will choose!' and among them who are thus gathered together, he thereby establishes concord.
yadveva devatāyā ādiśati / yāvatībhyo ha vai devatābhyo havīṃṣi gṛhyanta ṝṇamu haiva tāstena manyante yadasmai taṃkāmaṃ samardhayeyuryatkāmyā gṛhṇ āti tasmādvai devatāyā 'ādiśatyevameva yathāpūrvaṃ havīṃṣi gṛhītvā //	Another reason for which he announces (the oblation) to the deity, is this: whichever deities are chosen, they consider it as an obligation that they are bound to fulfil whatever wish he entertains whilst taking (the oblation); and for that reason also he announces it to the deity. After taking the oblations (to the other deities) in the same way as before ,--
athābhimṛśati / bhūtāya tvā nārātaya iti tadyata eva gṛhṇāti tadevaitatpunarāpyāyayati //	He touches (the rice that is left), with the text : 'For existence (or, abundance,--I leave) thee, not for non-offering !' He thereby causes it to increase again.
svarabhivikhyeṣamiti parivṛtamiva vā etadano bhavati tadasyaitaccakṣuḥ pāpmagṛhītamiva bhavati yajño vai svarahardevāḥ sūryastatsvarevaitadato bhivipaśyati //	He now (whilst seated on the cart) looks towards east, with the text : 'May I perceive the light!' For that cart being covered up, its eye is thereby, as it were, affected with evil. Light, moreover, represents the sacrifice, the day, the gods, and the sun; so that he thereby perceives this same (fourfold) light.

Those provided with doors are the houses: for the houses of the sacrificer might indeed be capable of breaking down behind the back of his Adhvaryu, when he walks forward (from the cart) with the sacrifice, and might crush his (the sacrificer's) family. By this (text), however, he causes them to stand firmly on this earth, so that they do not break down and crush (his family); for this reason he says: 'May those provided with doors stand firm on the earth!' He then walks forward (north of the Gârhapatya fire), with the text , 'I move along the wide aërial realm;' the application of which is the same .

But in the case of one whose Âhavanîya they use for cooking oblations, they place the utensils together in the Âhavanîya; and let him in that case put it (the rice) down at the back of the Âhavanîya. He should (in either case) do so, with the text , 'On the navel of the earth I place thee!' forthe navel means the centre, and the centre is safe from danger: for this reason he says, 'On the navel of the earth I place thee!' And further, 'In the lap of Aditi (the boundless or inviolable earth)!' for when people guard anything very carefully, they commonly say that 'they, as it were, carried it in their lap;' and this is the reason why he says, 'In the lap of Aditi!' And further, 'O Agni, do thou protect this offering!' whereby he makes this oblation over for protection both to Agni and to this earth: for this reason he says, 'O Agni, do thou protect this offering!'
pavitre karoti / pavitre stho vaiṣṇavyāviti yajño vai viṣṇuryajñiye stha ityevaitadāha // te vai dve bhavataḥ /	He now prepares two strainers (pavitra) , with the text : 'Purifiers (or strainers, pavitra) are ye, and belonging to Vishnu!' For Vishnu is the sacrifice; so that he thereby says, 'You belong to the sacrifice.'
ayaṃ vai pavitraṃ yo 'yam pavate so 'yameka ivaiva pavate so 'yam puruṣe 'ntaḥ praviṣṭaḥ prāṅca pratyaṅca tāvimau prāṇodānau tadetasyaivānu mātrāṃ tasmāddve bhavataḥ //	Two there are of them: for means of cleansing (pavitra) is this (wind) which here ventilates (pavate); and this, it is true, ventilates as one only; but on entering into man, it becomes a forward and a backward one, and they are these two, to wit, the prâna (breathing out) and the udâna (breathing up or in) . And as this (clarifying process) takes placein accordance with the measure of that (process of breathing), therefore there are two (strainers).
atho api trīṇi syuḥ / vyāno hi tṛtīyo dve nveva bhavatastābhyāmetāḥ prokṣaṇīrutpūya tābhiḥ prokṣati tadyadetābhyāmutpunāti //	There may also be three: for the vyâna (or pervading vital air) is a third (kind of breathing); but in reality there are only two. Having then strained the sprinkling water with these two (strainers), he sprinkles with it.
vṛtro ha vā idaṃ sarvaṃ vṛtvā śiśye / yadidamantareṇa dyāvāpṛthivī sa yadedaṃ sarvaṃ vṛtvā śiśye tasmādvṛtro nāma //	Vritra in truth lay covering all this (space) which here extends between heaven and earth, And because he lay covering (vri) all this, therefore his name is Vritra.

And in consequence of this, some of the waters became disgusted, and, rising higher and higher, flowed over: whence (sprung) these grasses (of which the strainers are made; for they represent the water which was not putrified. With the other (water), however, somematter has become mixed up, inasmuch as the putrid Vritra flowed into it. This he now removes from it by means of these two strainers; whereupon he sprinkles with the (sacrificially) pure water.
sa utpunāti /	This is the reason why he strains it through them.

For Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods, so that he strains this (water) as one impelled by Savitri. 'With this flawless purifier (ventilator, pavitra),' he says, because this (wind) which here ventilates (or purifies, pavate) is a flawless purifier. 'With the rays of the sun,' he says, because they, the rays of the sun, are certainly purifying; and for this reason he says, 'With the rays of the sun.'

For the waters are shining; and for this reason he says, 'Shining waters!' 'First-going,' he calls them, because they flow towards the sea and are therefore going in front (or forwards). 'First-drinking,' he calls them, because they are the first that drink of king Soma and are therefore 'drinking first.' And further: 'Forward now lead this sacrifice ,forward the Lord of Sacrifice, the liberal, god-loving Lord of Sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'Well (lead) the sacrifice, well the sacrificer!'

For Indra, when he was battling with Vritra, did choose them (the waters) and with their help he killed him; and for this reason he says, 'You Indra chose in the battle against Vritra!'

And further : 'Consecrated by sprinkling are ye!' With these words he makes amends to them .
tadetābhyo nihnute 'tha haviḥ prokṣatyeko vai prokṣaṇasya bandhurmedhyamevaitatkaroti //	He then sprinkles the (first) oblation . One and the same meaning applies to the (whole process of) sprinkling, viz.

He sprinkles, with the text : 'Thee, agreeable to Agni, I sprinkle!' Thus for whichever deity the oblation is intended, for that one he thereby renders it sacrificially pure.
atha yajñapātrāṇi prokṣati / daivyāya karmaṇo śundhadhvaṃ devayajyāyā iti daivyāya hi karmaṇo śundhati devayajyāyai yadvo 'śuddhaḥ parājaghnuridaṃ vastacundhāmīti tadyadevaiṣāmatrāśuddhastakṣā vānyo vāmedhyaḥ kaścitparāhanti tadevaiṣāmetadadbhirmedhyaṃ karoti tasmādāha yadvo 'śuddhāḥ parājaghnuridaṃ vastacundhāmīti //	He then sprinkles the sacrificial vessels ,with the text , 'Be ye pure for the divine work, for the sacrifice to the gods!' for it is for the divine work, the sacrifice to the gods, that he consecrates them. 'Whatever, that belongs to you, the impure have defiled by touching, that I hereby purify for you!' For whatever belonging to them some impure one--either a carpenter or some other impure person--has on this occasion desecrated by touching, that he thereby renders sacrificially pure for them by means of the water; and therefore he says, 'Whatever, that belongs to you, the impure have defiled by touching, that I hereby purify for you !'
atha kṛṣṇājinamādatte /	He now takes the black antelope skin , for completeness of the sacrifice.
yajñasyaiva sarvatvāya yajño ha devebhyo 'pacakrāma sa kṛṣṇo bhūtvā cacāra tasya devā anuvidya tvacamevāvacāyājahruḥ //	For once upon a time the sacrifice escaped the gods, and having become a black antelope roamed about. The gods having thereupon found it and stripped it of its skin, they brought it (the skin) away with them.

The brown and the yellow ones, on the other hand, represent the Yagus-texts.

For the completeness of the sacrifice (he takes the skin): hence the rite of initiation (for the Soma-sacrifice) is likewise performed on the black antelope skin;--for the completion of the sacrifice: hence it is also used for husking and bruising (the rice) on, in order that nothing of the oblation may get spilt; and that, if any grain or flour should now be spilt on it, the sacrifice would still remain securely established in the sacrifice.
atha kṛṣṇājinamādatte /	For this reason it is used for husking and bruising upon.

For karman ('hide') is the name of that (skin of the) black deer used among men, but sarman (bliss) is (that used) among the gods; and for this reason he says, 'Bliss-bestowing art thou!' He shakes it, with the text , 'Shaken off is the Rakshas, shaken off are the enemies!' whereby he repels from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas.
tatpratīcīnagrīvamupastṛṇāti /	He shakes it whilst holding it apart from the vessels ; whereby he shakes off whatever impure matter there may have been on it.

May Aditi acknowledge thee!' For Aditi is this earth, and whatever is on her, that serves as a skin to her: for this reason he says, 'The skin of Aditi art thou!' And 'may Aditi acknowledge thee!' he says, because one who is related (to another) acknowledges (him). Thereby he establishes a mutual understanding between her and the black antelope skin, (thinking) 'they will not hurt each other.' While it is still being held down with his left hand,--
nediha purā nāṣṭrā rakṣāṃsyāviśāniti brāhmaṇo hi rakṣasāmapahantā tasmādabhinihitameva savyena pāṇinā bhavati // atholūkhalaṃ nidadhāti /	He at once takes the mortar with his right hand, fearing lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, might rush in here in the meantime. For the priest (brâhmana) is the repeller of the Rakshas: therefore, whilst it is still being held down with his left hand,--

For, just as there (in the Soma-sacrifice) they press king Soma out with stones (grâvan), thus here also he prepares the oblation (haviryagña) by means of the mortar and pestle, and the large and small mill-stones . Now 'stones (adrayah)' is the common name of these, and therefore he says, 'a stone art thou.' And 'wooden,' he calls it, because this one (the mortar) really is made of wood . Or, he says, 'a broad-bottomed stone (grâvan) art thou,' because it is both a stone and broad-bottomed.

For it is (material for) sacrifice, and hence (by being offered in the fire) it becomes Agni's body. 'The releaser of speech,' he adds, because he now releases that speech which he restrained when he was about to take the rice (from the cart).

He adds: 'For the pleasure of the gods I seize thee!' for the oblation is taken with the intention 'that it shall gladden the gods.'
atha musalamādatte /	He now takes the pestle, with the text , 'A large, wooden stone art thou!' for it is a large stone, and made of wood, too.
bṛhadgrāvāsi vānaspatya iti bṛhadgrāvā hyeṣa vānaspatyo hyeṣa tadavadadhāti sa idaṃ devebhyo haviḥ śamīṣva suśami śamīṣveti sa idaṃ devebhyo haviḥ saṃskuru sādhusaṃskṛtaṃ saṃskurvityevaitadāha // atha haviṣkṛtamudvādayati / haviṣkṛdehi haviṣkṛdehīti vāgvai haviṣkṛdvācamevaitadvisṛjate vāgu vai yajñastadyajñamevaitatpunarupahvayate //	He thrusts it down, with the text , 'Do thou prepare this oblation for the gods ! do thou prepare it thoroughly!' thereby saying, 'Get this oblation ready for the gods! get it quite ready!' He then calls the Havishkrit (preparer of the sacrificial food), 'Havishkrit, come hither! Havishkrit, come hither!' The Havishkrit no doubt is speech, so that he thereby frees speech fromrestraint. And speech, moreover, represents sacrifice , so that he thereby again calls the sacrifice to him.
tāni vā etāni /	Now there are four different forms of this call, viz.
catvāri vāca ehīti brāhmaṇasyāgahyādraveti vaiśyasya ca rājanyabandhoścādhāveti śūdrasya sa yadeva brāhmaṇasya tadāhaitaddhi yajñiyatamametadu ha vai vācaḥ śāntataṃ yadehīti tasmādehītyeva brūyāt //	'come hither (ehi)!' in the case of a Brâhman; 'approach (âgahi)!' and 'hasten hither (âdrava)!' in the case of a Vaisya and a member of the military caste (râganyabandhu ); and 'run hither (âdhâva)!' in that of a Sûdra. On this occasion he uses the call that belongs to a Brâhman, because that one is best adapted for a sacrifice, and is besides the most gentle:.
taddha smaitatpurā /	let him therefore say, 'come hither (ehi)!'
jāyaiva haviṣkṛdupottiṣṭhati tadidamapyetarhi ya eva kaścopottiṣṭhati sa yatraiṣa haviṣkṛtamudvādayati tadeko dṛṣadupale samāhanti tadyadetāmatra vācam pratyudvādayanti //	Now in former times it was no other than the wife (of the sacrificer) who rose at this (call, to act) as Havishkrit; therefore now also (she or) some one (priest) rises in answer to this call. And at the time when he (the Adhvaryu) calls the Havishkrit, one of the priests beats the two mill-stones.[paragraph continues] The reason why they produce this discordant noise, is this:
manorha vā ṝṣabha āsa /	Manu was in possession of a bull .
tasminnasuraghnī sapatnaghnī vākpraviṣṭāsa tasya ha sma śvasathādravathādasurarakṣasāni mṛdyamānāni yanti te hāsurāḥ samūdire pāpaṃ vata no 'yamṛṣabhaḥ sacate kathaṃ nvimaṃ dabhnuyāmeti kilātākulī iti hāsurabrahmāvāsatuḥ //	Into him had entered an Asura-killing, foe-killing voice; and by his snorting and roaring the Asuras and Rakshas were continually being crushed. Thereupon the Asuras said to one another: 'Evil, alas! this bull inflicts upon us! how can we possibly destroy him?' Now Kilâta and Âkuli were the two priests (brahman) of the Asuras.
tau hocatuḥ / śraddhādevī vai manurāvaṃ nu vedāveti tau hāgatyocaturmano yājayāva tveti kenetyanenarṣabheṇeti tatheti tasyālabdhasya sa vāgapacakrāma //	These two said, 'God-fearing, they say, is Manu: let us two then ascertain!' They then went to him and said: 'Manu! we will sacrifice for thee!' He said: 'Wherewith?' They said: 'With this bull!' He said: 'So be it!' On his (the bull's) being killed the voice went from him.

Thereupon the Asuras said to one another: 'Hereby even greater evil is inflicted on us, for the human voice speaks more!' Kilâta and Âkuli then said: 'God-fearing, they say, is Manu: let us then ascertain!' They went to him and said: 'Manu! we will sacrifice for thee!' He said: 'Wherewith?'[paragraph continues] They said: 'With this thy wife!' He said: 'So be it!' And on her being killed that voice went from her.
sā yajna=ameva yajñapātrāṇi praviveśa /	It entered into the sacrifice itself, into the sacrificial vessels; and thence those two (Asura priests) were unable to expel it.
tato haināṃ na śekaturnirhantuṃ saiṣāsuraghnī vāgudvadati sa yasya haivaṃviduṣa etāmatra vācam pratyudvādayanti pāpīyāṃso haivāsya sapatnā bhavanti //	This same Asura-killing, foe-killing voice sounds forth (from the millstones when they are beaten with the wedge). And for whomsoever that knows this, they produce this discordant noise on the present occasion, his enemies are rendered very miserable.
kukkuṭo 'si madhujihva iti madhujihvo vai sa devebhya āsīdviṣajihvo 'surebhyaḥ sa yo devebhya āsīḥ sana edhītye vaitadāheṣamūrjamāvada tvayā vayaṃ saṅghātaṃ saṅghātaṃ jeṣmeti nātra tirohitamivāsti // atha śūrpamādatte / varṣavṛddhamasīti varṣavṛddhaṃ hyetadyadi naḍānāṃ yadi veṇūnāṃ yadīṣīkāṇāṃ varṣamuhyevaitā vardhayati //	He beats the mill-stones with the wedge, with the text : 'A honey-tongued cock (kukkuta ) art thou (O wedge)!' For honey-tongued indeed was he (the bull) for the gods, and poison-tongued for the Asuras: hence he thereby says: 'What thou wert for the gods, that be thou for us!' He adds: 'Sap and strength do thou call hither! with thy help may we conquer in every battle!' In these words there is nothing that is obscure. Thereupon he (the Adhvaryu) takes the winnowing basket, with the text : 'Rain-grown art thou!' For rain-grown it is indeed, whether it be made of reeds or of cane or of rushes, since it is the rain that makes these grow.
prati tvā varṣavṛddhaṃ vettviti varṣavṛddhā u hyevaite yadi vrīhayo yadi yavā varṣamuhyevaitānvardhayati tatsaṃjñāmevaitacūrpāya ca vadati nedanyo 'nyaṃ hinasāta iti //	He then pours out the (threshed) rice (from the mortar into the winnowing basket), with the text : 'May the rain-grown acknowledge (receive) thee!' For rain-grown also are these (grains), whether they be rice or barley, since it is the rain that makes them grow.
atha niṣpunāti / parāpūtaṃ rakṣaḥ parāpūtā arātaya ityatha tuṣānprahantyapahataṃ rakṣa iti tannāṣṭrā evaitadrakṣāṃsyato 'pahanti //	He now winnows (the rice), with the text : 'Cleared off is the Rakshas! cleared off are the evil-doers!' The husks (which have fallen on the ground) he throws away , with the text , 'Expelled is the Rakshas!' for those evil spirits, the Rakshas, he thereby expels.
vāyurvo vivinaktvityayaṃ vai vāyuryo 'yam pavata eṣa vā idaṃ sarvaṃ vivinakti yadidaṃ kiṃca vivicyate tadenāneṣa evaitad vivinaktisa yadaita etatprāpnuvanti yatrainān adhyapavinakti //	He then separates (the husked grains from the unhusked), with the text : 'May the wind separate you!' For it is that wind (which is produced by the winnowing) which here purifies (or blows, pavate); and it is the wind that separates everything here (on earth) that undergoes separation: therefore it also separates here those (two kinds of grain) from each other.
athānumantrayate /	Now when they are undergoing this process, and whilst he is separating (the husked, so as to drop them into a pot),--
devo vaḥ savitā hiraṇyapāṇiḥ pratigṛbhṇātvācidreṇa pāṇinā supratigṛhītā asannityatha triḥ phalīkaroti trivṛddhi yajñaḥ //	He addresses (those in the pot) thus : 'May the divine Savitri, the golden-handed, receive you with a flawless hand!' By this he says: 'May they be well received!' He then cleans them thrice ; for threefold is the sacrifice.
taddhaike devebhyaḥ śundhadhvaṃ devebhyaḥ śundhadhvamiti phalīkurvanti tadu tathā na kuryādādiṣṭaṃ vā etaddevatāyai havirbhavatyathaitadvaiśvadevaṃ karoti yadāha devebhyaḥ śundhadhvamiti tatsamadaṃ karoti tasmādu tūṣṇīmeva phalīkuryāt //	Here now some clean them with the formula: 'For the gods get clean! for the gods get clean!' But let him not do so: for this oblation is intended for some particular deity; and if he were to say, 'For the gods get clean!' he would make it one intended for all the deities, and would thereby raise a quarrel among the deities. Let him therefore do the cleaning silently! Now the one (viz.
sa vai kapālānyevānyatara upadadhāti /	the Âgnîdhra) puts the potsherds on (the Gârhapatya fire); the other (viz.
dṛṣadupale anyatarastadvā etadubhayaṃ saha kriyate tadyadetadubhayaṃ saha kriyate //	the Adhvaryu) the two mill-stones (on the black antelope skin): these two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why they are done simultaneously (is this):
śiro ha vā etadyajñasya yatpuroḍāśaḥ sa gānyevemāni śīrṣṇaḥ kapālānyetānyevāsya kapālāni mastiṣka eva piṣṭāni tadvā etadekamaṅgamekaṃ saha karavāva samānaṃ karavāveti tasmādvā etadubhayaṃ saha kriyate //	The head of this sacrifice is (represented by) the rice-cake : for those potsherds (kapâla), no doubt, are to this (rice-cake) what the skull bones (kapâla) are to the head, and the ground rice isnothing else than the brain. Now this (combination of skull and brain) certainly forms one limb: 'Let us put that (which is) one together! Let us make it one!' thus they think; and therefore the two acts are done simultaneously.
sa yaḥ kapālānyupadadhāti / sa upaveṣamādatte dhṛṣṭirasīti sa yadenenāgniṃ dhṛṣṇivopacarati tena dhṛṣṭiratha yadenena yajña upālabhata upeva vā enenaitadveṣṭi tasmādupaveṣo nāma //	He who puts the potsherds on (the fire), takes the shovelling-stick (upavesha), with the text : 'Bold (dhrishti) art thou!' For since with it he, as it were, attacks the fire boldly, therefore it is called dhrishti . And since with it he touches (the coals) at the sacrifice, since with it he attends to (upa-vish) this (Gârhapatya fire), therefore it is called upavesha.
tena prāco 'ṅgārānudūhati / apāgne agnimāmādaṃ jahi niṣkravyādaṃ sedhetyayaṃ vā āmādyenedam manuṣyāḥ paktvāśnantyatha yena puruṣaṃ dahanti sa kravyādetāvevaitadubhāvato 'pahanti // athāṅgāramāskauti /	With it he shifts the coals to the fore-part (of the khara or hearth-mound), with the text : 'O fire! cast off the fire that eateth raw flesh! drive away the corpse-eating one!' For the raw flesh-eating (fire) is the one with which men cook what they eat; and the corpse-eating one is that on which they burn (the dead) man: these two he thereby expels from it (the Gârhapatya).
ā devayajaṃ vaheti yo devayāṭ tasmin havīṃṣi śrapayāma tasminyajñaṃ tanavāmahā iti tasmādvāāskauti //	He now pulls toward himself one coal, with the text : 'Bring hither that (fire) which maketh offerings to the gods!' He thinks: 'On that (fire), which makes offerings to the gods, wewill cook the oblations! on that one we will perform the sacrifice!' and for this reason he pulls (one of the coals) toward himself.
tam madhyamena kapālenābhyupadadhāti /	On it he places the central potsherd .
devā ha vai yajñaṃtanvānāste 'surarakṣasebhya āsaṅgādbibhayāṃcakrurnenno 'dhastānnāṣṭrā rakṣāṃsyupottiṣṭhānityagnirhi rakṣasāmapahantā tasmādevamupadadhāti tadyadeṣa eva bhavati nānya eṣa hi yajuṣkṛto medhyastasmānmadhyamena kapālenābhyupadadhāti //	Forthe gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were in fear of a disturbance from the Asuras and Rakshas. They were afraid lest those evil spirits, the Rakshas, might rise from below them. Now Agni (fire) is the repeller of the Rakshas, and for this reason he thus places (the potsherd) on it. The reason why it is just this (coal) and no other (on which the potsherd is put) is, that this one, having been consecrated by the (above) sacrificial formula, is sacrificially pure: that is why he places the central potsherd on it.
sa upadadhāti /	He puts it on, with the text : 'Thou art firm; make thou the earth firm!' For under the form of the earth he renders this same (sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy.
dhruvamasi pṛthivīṃ dṛṃheti pṛthivyā eva rūpeṇaitadeva dṛṃhatyetenaiva dviṣantam bhrātṛvyamavabādhate brahmavani tvā kṣatravani sajātavanyupadadhāmi bhrātṛvyasya vadhāyeti bahvī vai yajuḥsvāśīstadbrahma ca kṣatraṃ cāśāsta ubhe vīrya sajātavanīti bhūmā vai sajātāstadbhūmānamāśāsta upadadhāmi bhrātṛvyasya badhāyeti yadi nābhicaredyadya abhicaredamuṣya badhāyeti brūyādabhinihitameva savyasya pāṇeraṅgulyā bhavati //	He adds: 'Thee, devoted to the Brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the (sacrificer's) kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!' Manifold, indeed, are the prayers for blessing in the sacrificial texts (yagus): by this one he prays for the priestly and military orders, those two towers of strength (vi rye, energies) . 'Thee, devoted to the (sacrificer's) kinsmen,' he says, because kinsmen mean wealth, and wealth he thereby prays for. When he says, 'I put thee on for the destruction of the enemy,' whether or not he wishes to exorcise, let him say, 'for the destruction of soand so!' The moment it (the potsherd) has been put down (and while it is still being touched) with the (fore-)finger of his left hand,--
nediha purā nāṣṭrā rakṣāṃsyāviśāniti brāhmaṇo hi rakṣasāmapahantā tasmādabhinihitameva savyasya pāṇeraṅgulyā bhavati //	He seizes a (second) coal, lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should in the meantime rush in here. For the Brâhman is the repeller of the Rakshas : hence, the moment it (the potsherd) has been put down (and while it is still being touched) with the finger of his left hand,--
agne brahma gṛbhṇīṣveti nediha purā nāṣṭrā rakṣāṃsyāviśānityagnirhi rakṣasāmapahantā tasmādenamadhyūhati //	He pushes the coal on it, with the text : 'Accept, O Agni, this holy work (brahman) !' He says this, lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should rush in here before; for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas: this is the reason why he pushes it on (the potsherd).
atha yatpaścāttadupadadhāti /	He then puts on that one which is (to stand) before (i.e.
dharuṇamasyantarikṣaṃ dṛṃhetyantarikṣasyaiva rūpeṇaitadeva dṛṃhatyetenaiva dviṣantam bhrātṛvyamavabādhate brahmavani tvā kṣatravani sajātavanyupadadhāmi bhrātṛvyasya badhāyeti //	east of the first potsherd), with the text : 'A stay art thou! do thou make firm the sky!' Under the form of the sky he makes this same (sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds: 'Thee, devoted to the brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!'
atha yaddakṣiṇatastadupapadhāti /	He now puts on the one that is (to stand) on the right (i.e.
viśvābhyastvāśābhya upadadhāmīti sa yadimāṃllokānati caturthamasti vā na vā tenaivaitaddviṣantam bhrātṛvyamavabādhate 'naddhā vai tadyadimāṃllokānati caturthamasti vā na vānaddho tadyadviśvā āśāstasmādāha viśvābhyastvāśābhya upadadhāmīti tūṣṇīṃ vaivetarāṇi kapālānyupadadhāti cita sthordhvacita iti vā //	south of the first), with the text : 'For all the regions I put thee on!' What fourth (world) there is or is not beyond these (three) worlds, by that indeed he thereby chases away the spiteful enemy. Uncertain, no doubt, is what fourth (world) there is or is not beyond these (three) worlds, and uncertain also are all those regions; for this reason he says, 'For all the regions I put thee on!' The remaining potsherds he puts on either silently, or with the text : 'Layer-forming are ye! heap-forming are ye!'
athāṅgārairabhyūhati / bhṛgūṇāmaṅgirasāṃ tapasā tapyadhvamityetadvai tejiṣṭhaṃ tejo yadbhṛgvaṅgirasāṃ sutaptānyasanniti tasmādenamabhyūhati //	He then covers them over with (hot) coals, whilst muttering the text : 'May ye be heated with the heat of the Bhrigus and[paragraph continues] Aṅgiras !' for it is indeed the brightest light, that of the Bhrigus and Aṅgiras.
atha yo dṛṣadupale upadadhāti /	He covers them with the view that 'they shall be well heated.'

He shakes it, with the text (ib.): 'Shaken off is the Rakshas, shaken off are the enemies!' the import and application of which is the same .

May Aditi acknowledge (receive) thee!' the import (of this formula) being the same . He then puts the lower mill-stone on it, with the text : 'A rock-bowl art thou! May the skin of Aditi acknowledge thee!' for it is a bowl (dhishanâ) and a rock too; and by saying, 'May the skin of Aditi acknowledge thee,' he establishes an understanding between it and the black antelope skin, so that 'they will not hurt each other.' This one (the lower mill-stone) represents the earth.
dhiṣaṇāsi pārvateyī prati tvā parvatī vettviti kanīyasī hyeṣā duhiteva bhavati tasmādāha pārvateyīti prati tvā parvatī vettviti prati hi svaḥ saṃjānīte tatsaṃjñāmevaitaddṛṣadupalābhyāṃ vadati nedanyo 'nyaṃ hinasāta iti dyaurevaiṣā rūpeṇa hanū eva dṛṣadupalejihvaiva śamyā tasmācamyayā samāhanti jihvayā hi vadati //	He then puts the upper mill-stone on (the lower one), with the text : 'A rock-born bowl art thou! May the rock acknowledge thee!' For this one being smaller is, as it were, the daughter (of the lower mill-stone) ; for this reason he calls it 'rock-born.' 'May the rock acknowledge thee!' he says, because one of the same kin acknowledges (receives the other): thereby he establishes an understanding between those two millstones, thinking 'they will not hurt one another!' This one, as it were, represents the sky; (or) the two mill-stones are, as it were, the two jaws, and the wedge is the tongue: that is why he beats (the mill-stones) with the wedge , for it is with the tongue that one speaks.
dhānyamasi dhinuhi devāniti dhānyaṃ hi devāndhinavadityu hi havirgṛhyate // atha pinaṣṭi /	He now pours the rice on (the lower stone), with the text : 'Grain (dhânyam) art thou! do thou gratify (dhi) the gods!' for it isgrain; and it is with the intention 'that it may gratify the gods' that the rice-oblation is taken.
prāṇāya tvodānāya tvā vyānāya tvā dīrghāmanu prasitimāyuṣe dhāmiti prohati devo vaḥ savitā hiraṇyapāṇiḥ pratigṛbhṇātvacidreṇa pāṇinā cakṣuṣe tveti //	He then grinds it, with the text : 'For out-breathing (I grind) thee! for in-breathing thee! for through-breathing (pervading vital air) thee! May I impart a long duration to the life (of the sacrificer) !' He pours it (the ground rice on the skin), with the text (ib.): 'May the divine Savitri, the golden-handed, receive thee with a flawless hand !' 'For his (the sacrificer's) eye (I look at) thee !'
tadyadevam pinaṣṭi / jīvaṃ vai devānāṃ haviramṛtamamṛtānāmathaitadulūkhalamusalābhyāṃ dṛṣadupalābhyāṃ haviryajñaṃ ghnanti //	The reason why he thus grinds it, is that the sacrificial food of the gods is living, is amrita (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. Now with the mortar and pestle, and with the two millstones they kill this rice-offering (haviryagña).
prāṇāya tvodānāya tveti tatprāṇodānau dadhāti vyānāya tveti tadvyānaṃ dadhāti dīrghāmanu prasitimāyuṣe dhāmiti tadāyurdadhāti devo vaḥ savitā hiraṇyapāṇiḥ pratigṛbhṇātvacidreṇa pāṇinā supratigṛhītānyasanniti cakṣuṣe tveti taccakṣurdadhātyetāni vai jīvato bhavantyevamu haitajjīvameva devānāṃ havirbhavatyamṛtamamṛtānāṃ tasmādevam pinaṣṭi piṃṣanti piṣṭānyabhīndhate kapālāni //	When he now says: 'For out-breathing thee! for in-breathing thee!' he thereby again imparts out-breathing and in-breathing (to it), and by saying 'for through-breathing thee!' he imparts through-breathing (to it). By 'may I impart a long duration to the life!' he bestows life on it. By 'may the divine Savitri, the golden-handed, receive thee with a flawlesshand!' he says: 'May they be well received!' By 'for the eye thee!' he bestows eye-sight on it. Now these (attributes) are those of a living being; and thus that sacrificial food for the gods is indeed living, is amrita (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. This is the reason why he thus grinds (the rice).
athaika ājyaṃ nirvapati /	Some one pours clarified butter (into the âgyasthâlî, or butter-pot).
yadvā ādiṣṭaṃ devatāyai havirgṛhyate yāvaddevatyaṃ tadbhavati taditareṇa yajuṣā gṛhṇāti na vā etatkasyai cana devatāyai havirgṛhṇannādiśati yadājyaṃ tasmādaniruktena yajuṣā gṛhṇāti mahīnām payo 'sīti mahya iti ha vā etāsāmeke nāma yadgavāṃ tāsāṃ vā etatpayo bhavati tasmādāha mahīnām payo 'sītyevamu hāsyaitatkhalu yajuṣaiva gṛhītam bhavati tasmādvevāha mahīnām payo 'sīti //	Now whatever oblation, in being taken, is announced to a (particular) deity, that belongs to the respective deity, that he takes with a special prayer; but in taking this oblation, to wit, the butter, he does not announce it to any particular deity, and therefore takes it with an undefined formula, viz. with : 'Juice of the great ones art thou!' For 'the great ones' some (take to be) a name for the cows; and their juice indeed it is: for this reason he says, 'The juice of the great ones art thou!' And thus, moreover, is some of that (butter) taken with a sacrificial formula: and for this reason also he says, 'The juice of the great ones art thou!'
pavitravati samvapati /	He pours (the ground rice) into that which contains the strainers--viz.
pātryām pavitre avadhāya devasya tvāsavituḥ prasave 'śvinorbāhubhyām pūṣṇo hastābhyāṃ samvapāmīti so 'sāvevaitasya yajuṣo bandhuḥ //	into a dish (pâtrî) on which he has laid the two strainers--with the text : 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri I pour thee out, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan!'

He (the Adhvaryu) receives it through the strainers, with the text : 'Let the waters mingle with the plants!' for thereby the water unites with the plants, viz. with the ground rice,--'The plants with the sap!' for the plants thereby unite with the sap; viz. that ground rice with the water, for water is their sap,--'The shining (or wealthy ones) with the moving!' for the shining ones are the waters, and the moving ones are the plants, and these two are thereby mixed together,--'Let the sweet mingle with the sweet!' whereby he says, 'let the savoury be mixed with the savoury!'
atha saṃyauti / janayatyai tvā saṃyaumīti yathā vā adhivṛkto 'gneradhi jāyetaivaṃ vai tatsaṃyauti //	He then mixes (the two) together, with the text : 'For generation I unite thee!' for, in order that it (the dough or the sacrificial cake prepared from it) may bring offspring to the sacrificer,for his prosperity, for food, and so on,--for these reasons he mixes them together.

He then touches them,--where (by so doing) he would not again mix (the two) together,--with the (respective) formulas : 'This to Agni!' 'This to Agni-Soma!' Separately indeed they take that sacrificial food (from the cart) in the first place ; then they thresh it together, then they grind it together, then he again divides it: for this reason he thus touches (them separately). The one (the Adhvaryu) now places the cake over (the fire), the other (the Âgnîdhra) puts the clarified butter on:

The reason why these two acts are done simultaneously is that one half of the body of the sacrifice no doubt is that butter, and the other half is this rice-offering. 'That half and this half, these two let us now take to the fire!' thus (they think): for this reason those two acts are done simultaneously, and thus this body of the sacrifice is joined together.
so 'sāvājyamadhiśrayati / iṣe tveti vṛṣṭyai tadāha yadāheṣe tveti tatpunarudvāsayatyūrje tveti yo vṛṣṭādūrgraso jāyate tasmai tadāha //	That one (the Âgnîdhra) puts the butter on, with the text : 'For sap--thee!' When he says 'for sap thee!' he says it for the sake of rain; therefore he takes it off again, with the text : 'For juice--thee!' What juice isderived (by the plants) from the rain, for that he says this.
atha puroḍāśamadhivṛṇakti / dharmo 'sīti yajñamevaitatkaroti yathā gharmam pravṛṃjyādevam pravṛṇakti viśvāyuriti tadāyurdadhāti //	Now he (the Adhvaryu) puts on (adhi-vrig) the cake, with the text : 'Heat (or a hot vessel, gharma) art thou!' whereby he makes it (a means of) sacrifice, and puts it on in the same (way as if he were putting the (pravargya) cauldron gharma) on,--'Life-sustaining (visvâyus)!' he adds, whereby he obtains life (for the sacrificer).
tam prathayati / uruprathā uru prathasveti prathayatyevainametadur/	He spreads it (over the respective potsherds), with the text : 'Spread widely, thou wide-spreading one!' whereby he causes it to spread.

Unlucky for (or, excluded from) the sacrifice indeed is that one, to wit, the common (cake). 'That I may not do anything thatis unlucky at the sacrifice,' thus (he thinks, and) for that reason he should not make it too broad.

But who knows how large is a horse's hoof? Let him make it of such a size as in his own mind he does not think would be too broad.

He adds: 'In the highest heaven!' He means to say 'among the gods,' when he says 'in the highest heaven.' He touches it: 'I will ascertain whether it is done!' thus (he thinks, and) for that reason he touches it.

'That the sacrifice or the sacrificer may not languish after this, when I cover this over,' thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he covers it over in this manner (i.e.

He also whom they chose the second time passed away. He also whom they chose the third time passed away . Thereupon the one who still constitutes the fire in our own time, concealed himself from fear.

When he slew Visvarûpa, the three-headed son of Tvashtri, they also knew of his going to be killed.; and straightway Trita slew him. Indra, assuredly, was free from that (sin), for he is a god .

ta u hāptyā ūcuḥ /	And the Âptyas then said: 'Let us make this pass on beyond us!' 'On whom?' they asked.

Hence one must not make an offering without a dakshinâ; for the sacrifice wipes (the guilt) off upon the Âptyas, and the Âptyas wipe it off upon him who makes an offering without a dakshinâ.

That (rinsing water) he pours out (for each Âptya) separately: thus he avoids a quarrel among them. He makes it hot (previously) : thus it becomes boiled (drinkable) for them. He pours it out with the formulas, 'For Trita thee!' 'For Dvita thee!' 'For Ekata thee!'--Now it is as an animal sacrifice that this sacrificial cake is offered .

It entered into the horse. They offered up the horse. When it was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of it. It entered into the ox.

They found it (in the shape of) those two (substances), the rice and barley: therefore even now they obtain those two by digging; and as muchefficacy as all those sacrificed animal victims would have for him, so much efficacy has this oblation (of rice &c.) for him who knows this. And thus there is in this oblation also that completeness which they call 'the fivefold animal sacrifice.'

When it is baked, it becomes bone: for then it becomes somewhat hard; and hard is the bone. And when he is about to take it off (the fire) and sprinkles it with butter, he changes it into marrow.

The sheep which they had sacrificed, became a camel. The goat which they had sacrificed, became a sarabha . For this reason one should not eat (the flesh) of these animals, for these animals are deprived of the sacrificial essence (are impure).

That piece, moreover, with which he struck him, was broken off (sri); and on falling down it became an arrow (sara): hence the designation arrow, because it was broken off. And in this way the thunderbolt became fourfold.

Savitri, namely, is the impeller of the gods: thus he thereby takes that (wooden sword) as one impelled by Savitri. 'With the arms of the Asvins,' he says, because the Asvins are the two Adhvaryu priests (of the gods): with their arms he therefore takes it, not with his own.

After taking it in his left hand and touching it with his right, he murmurs--by what he murmurs he makes it sharp,--

'The thousand-spiked, hundred-edged! he adds, for a thousand spikes and a hundred edges had that thunderbolt which he hurled at Vritra: he thereby makes it to be that (thunderbolt). 'The sharp-edged Vâyu (wind) art thou!' he adds; for that indeed is the sharpest edge, to wit, that (wind) which here blows: for that one sweeps right across these worlds.

When it has been sharpened, he must not touch either himself or the earth with it: 'Lest I should hurt either myself or the earth with that sharp thunderbolt,' thus he thinks, and forthat reason he does not touch either himself or the earth with it.

The Adhvaryu then shuts them in from here,; and whilst shutting them in, he puts them down by means of these (three) worlds; and from what fourth world there is beyond these (three) they do not rise again. Thus now also they do not rise again, for by the same means by which the gods kept them off, the priests now also keep them off during the sacrifice.

And in putting him down with these (three) worlds, and what fourth world there is beyond these, he flings everything away from this (earth), for on it all these worlds rest: for what would he fling away, if he were to fling (the grass-bush) away with the words, 'The air I throw away, the heaven I throw away!' therefore he flings everything away from this (earth) .

He further says (whilst looking at the hole in the ground): 'May the sky rain on thee!' Wherever, in digging into her, they wound and injure her--water being (a means of) expiation--that he thereby expiates by the water which is (a means of) expiation; that he thereby makes good by means of the water: that is the reason why he says: 'May the sky rain on thee!'--'Tie him down, O divine Savitri, to the furthest end of the earth!' he says (whilst throwing on the heap of rubbish the soil dug up); he thussays to the divine Savitri: 'Tie him down to blind darkness!' when he says 'to the furthest end of the earth,'--'With a hundred fetters!' by this he means to say, 'so that he cannot free himself.'--'Him who hates us and whom we hate, do not release from there!' Whether or not he wishes to exorcise, let him say: 'So and so .

May the sky rain on thee! Tie him down, O divine Savitri, to the furthest end of the earth, with a hundred fetters, him who hates us and whom we hate, do not release him from there!' The Âgnîdhra presses it down (on the heap of rubbish), with the text : 'O Araru! thou shalt not fly up to heaven!' For when the gods drove away Araru, the Asura-Rakshas, he wished to fly up to heaven.

Her (the earth's) drop no doubt is that moisture of hers upon which the creatures subsist. 'Let this thine (moisture) not fly away to the sky!' he thereby says.--He adds (whilst again repeating the several acts): 'Go to the fold, the abode of the cows! May the sky rain on thee! Tie him down, O divine Savitri, to the furthest end of the earth, with a hundred fetters, him who hates us and whom we hate, do not release him from there!'
sa vai triryajuṣā harati / trayo vā ime lokā ebhirevainame tallokairabhinidadhātyaddhā vai tadyadime lokā addho tadyadyajustasmāttriryajuṣā harati //	Three times he throws it, with the sacrificial formula (Yagus); for three are these worlds, and with these worlds he thereby puts him (the evil spirit) down . And what these worlds are, that in truth is the Yagus: for that reason he throws it thrice with the sacrificial formula.

For uncertain indeed is what fourth world there may or may not be beyond these (three); and uncertain also is what (is done) silently: for that reason (he throws) silently a fourth time.
devāśca vā asurāśca / ubhaye prājāpatyāḥ paspṛdhire tato devā anuvyamivāsuratha hāsurā menire 'smākamevedaṃ khalu bhuvanamiti //	The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending for superiority. Then the gods were worsted, and the Asuras thought: 'To us alone assuredly belongs this world!
hantemām pṛthivīṃ vibhajāmahai tāṃ vibhajyopajīvāmeti tāmaukṣṇaiścarmabhiḥ paścātprāñco vibhajamānā abhīyuḥ //	They thereupon said: 'Well then, let us divide this world between us; and having divided it, let us subsist thereon!' They accordingly set about dividing it with ox-hides from west to east.
tadvai devāḥ śuśruvuḥ /	The gods then heard of this, and said: 'The Asuras are actually dividing this earth: come, let us go to where the Asuras are dividing it.

Placing Vishnu, (in the shape of) this very sacrifice, at their head, they went (to the Asuras).

Let a part of it be ours!' The Asuras replied rather grudgingly: 'As much as this Vishnu lies upon, and no more, we give you!'
vāmano ha viṣnurāsa /	Now Vishnu was a dwarf .
taddevā na jihīḍire mahadvai no 'durye no yajñasaṃmitamaduriti //	The gods, however,were not offended at this, but said: 'Much indeed they gave us, who gave us what is equal in size to the sacrifice.'

For this reason they say, 'As great as the altar is, so great is the earth;' for by it (the altar) they obtained this entire (earth). And, verily, he who so understands this, wrests likewise this entire (earth) from his rivals, excludes his rivals from sharing in it.

What has become of the sacrifice?' They said: 'On all (three) sides he is enclosed by the metres, with Agni to the east, there is no (way of) escaping: search for him in this very place!' By slightly digging they accordingly searched for him. They discovered him at a depth of three inches (or thumb's breadths): therefore the altar should be three inches deep; and therefore also Pâñki made the altar for the Soma-sacrifice three inches deep.
tadu tatha na kuryāt /	This, however, one must not do.

And since they found (anu-vid) Vishnu in that place, therefore it is called vedi (altar).

As large as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent is, so wide does he thereby enclose it.

As large as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent is, so wide does he thereby enclose it.
vyāmamātrī paścātsyādityāhuḥ /	'Let it (the altar) measure a fathom across on the west side,' they say: that, namely, is the size of a man, and it (the altar) should be of (the) man's size.

yoṣā vai vedirvṛṣāgniḥ parigṛhya vai yoṣā vṛṣāṇaṃ śete mithunamevaitatprajananaṃ kriyate tasmādabhito 'gnimaṃsā unnayati //	For the altar (vedi, fem.) is female and the fire (agni, masc.) is male; and the woman lies embracing the man: thereby a copulation productive of offspring is obtained. For this reason he carries the two shoulders (of the altar) along both sides of the fire.

Thereby he makes it (the altar) pleasing to the gods.

To the south side he sweeps the rubbish (loose soil), for that is the quarter of the deceased ancestors. If it (the altar) were sloping towards south, the sacrificer would speedily go to yonder world; and thus (by making the altar in the prescribed way) the sacrificer lives for a long time: for this reason he sweeps the loose soil to the south side. Lethim then cover it (the altar) over with (fresh) rubbish: for rubbish means cattle, and well-stocked with cattle he thereby makes it .

They accordingly removed to the moon what imperishable place of worship there was on this earth. That now is the black (spots) in the moon: hence they say, 'In the moon is the place of worship for this earth.' It is in this place of worship also that his sacrifice is performed: for that reason he smooths (the altar) down .

If he were to set the sprinkling-water down, while the wooden sword is still lying, the two thunderbolts would come into collision with each other; but in this way the two thunderbolts do not come into collision with each other: for that reason he takes up the wooden sword, while the sprinkling-water is being held close above it.

This is a direction (given tothe Âgnîdhra); he (the Adhvaryu) may pronounce it, if he choose; or, if he so choose, he may omit it: for he (the Âgnîdhra) himself knows that this work has now to be done.

Then unbelief took hold of men: 'Those who sacrifice become more sinful, and those who sacrifice not become righteous,' they said. No sacrificial food then came to the gods from this world: for the gods subsist on what is offered up from this world .

Brihaspati Âṅgirasa then went and said, 'How comes it that you do not sacrifice?' They replied, 'From a desire for whatshould we sacrifice, since those who sacrifice become more sinful, and those who sacrifice not become righteous?'

If, therefore, before the spreading of the sacrificial grass anything were to fall on it, let him only remove it at the time when he spreads the sacrificial grass; for when they spread the sacrificial grass, then they also step on it with the foot. He who knowing this sacrifices without touching, becomes indeed righteous: let him therefore sacrifice, without touching (the altar and oblations).

He thereby rinses them with two substances for the gods, and with one for men; viz. with water and the brahman (spirit of worship) for the gods,--for the water is (represented by) the sacrificial grass , and the brahman (by) the sacrificial formula;--and with one for men, that is with water alone: and thus this takes place separately .
atha sruvamādatte / tam pratapati pratyuṣṭaṃ rakṣaḥ pratyuṣṭā arātayo niṣṭaptaṃ rakṣo niṣṭaptā arātaya iti vā //	He, in the first place, takes the dipping-spoon[paragraph continues] (sruva, masc.) and makes it hot (on the Gârhapatya fire), with either of the texts , 'Scorched is the Rakshas, scorched are the enemies!' or, 'Burnt out is the Rakshas, burnt out are the enemies!'

Further, 'Thee, the food-abounding (masc.), I cleanse for the kindling of food !'--'thee that art suitable for the sacrifice, I cleanse for the sacrifice,' he thereby says. In the same way he brushes all the spoons, saying, 'Thee, the food-abounding (fem.) .

This is the reason why he brushes the dipping-spoon first, and afterwards the other (offering-)spoons.

'To the veda (grass-bunch) they assuredly belonged, and the spoons have been cleaned with them: hence it is something that belongs to the sacrifice, and (we throw it into the fire) in order that it should not become excluded from the sacrifice,' thus (they argue).

'May the sacrifice go on increasing before me!' thus (she thinks while) he girds her, thinking, 'may she sit thus girt by my sacrifice!'
yoktreṇa saṃnahyati /	He girds her with a cord (yoktra): for with a cord (yoktra) they yoke the draught-animal (yogya).

This is the reason why he girds the wife .
sa vā abhivāsaḥ saṃnahyati /	He girds her over the garment.
oṣadhayo vai vāso varuṇyā rajjustadoṣadhīrevaitadantardadhāti tatho haināmeṣā varuṇyā rajjurna hinasti tasmādabhivāsaḥ saṃnahyati //	Now the garment represents the plants, and (the cord represents) Varuna's noose (raggu): hence he thereby places the plants between (her and the noose), andthus that noose of Varuna does not injure her.
sa saṃnahyati /	This is the reason why he girds her over the garment.

Aditi, indeed, is this earth. She is the wife of the gods, and that one is his (the sacrificer's) wife. It is for the latter, accordingly, that he makes it a zone instead of a noose (or string).
sa vai na granthim kuryāt / varuṇyo vai granthirvaruṇo ha patnīṃ gṛhṇīyādyadgranthiṃ kuryāttasmānna granthiṃ karoti //	A zone means a girdle, and he thereby makes it this for her. Let him not make a knot , for the knot is Varuna's (attribute); and Varuna would lay hold on the (sacrificer's) wife, if he were to make a knot.
ūrdhvamevodgūhati /	For this reason he does not make a knot.
viṣṇorveṣyo 'sīti sā vai na paścātprācī devānāṃ yajñamanvāsīteyaṃ vai pṛthivyaditiḥ seyaṃ devānām patnī sā paścātprācī devānāṃ yajñamanvāste taddhemāmabhyārohetsā patnī kṣipre 'muṃ lokamiyāttatho ha patnī jyogjīvati tadasyā evaitannihnute tatho haināmiyaṃ na hinasti tasmādu dakṣiṇata ivaivānvāsīta //	He twists it through upwards , with the text , 'The pervader , of Vishnu art thou!' Let her not sit to the west of the sacrifice, with her face towards the east. For Aditi is this earth , she is the wife of the gods, and she indeed sits on the west of the sacrifice of the gods, with her face turnedtowards the east: and this lady would, therefore, raise herself to her (Aditi), and would speedily go to yonder world. And thus (viz. by sitting in the prescribed way) she lives for a long time, thus she propitiates her (Aditi), and thus the latter harms her not.
athājyamavekṣate /	For this reason let her sit somewhat to the south.
yoṣā vai patnī reta ājyam mithunamevaitatprajananaṃ kriyate tasmādājyamavekṣate //	She looks down upon the sacrificial butter ; for assuredly that wife is a woman, and the butter (represents) seed: hence a productive union is thereby brought about.
sāvekṣate /	For this reason she looks towards the butter.

athājyamādāya prāṅudāharati /	Having then taken up the butter (from theground), he (the Âgnîdhra) carries it eastwards.

The reason why he first puts it thereon (viz. on the Gârhapatya) is, because he will have to make the wife look at it: for it would not be proper, if he were to take it (from the Âhavanîya) to the west in the midst of the performance, for the purpose of making the wife look at it; and if he were not to let the wife look at it at all, he would thereby exclude her from the sacrifice. And in this way, then, he does not exclude the (sacrificer's) wife from the sacrifice: therefore he does not take it eastwards till after melting it close by the wife (on the Gârhapatya), and making her look at it.
tadāhuḥ /	He then takes it again from thence and puts it down within the altar.

Yâgñavalkya, however, said in reference to this point, 'Let it be so as it has been prescribed for the wife! who would care whether his wife may consort with other men ?' 'As the altar is (part of the) sacrifice, and the butter is (part of the) sacrifice, I will build up the sacrifice from out of the sacrifice!' thus thinking, let him place it within the altar.
prokṣaṇīṣu pavitre bhavataḥ /	The two strainers are lying in the sprinkling water.
te tata ādatte tābhyāmājyamutpunātyeko vā utpavanasya bandhurmedhyamevaitatkaroti //	He takes them from thence and purifies (ut-pû) the butter with them. Now one of them is related to the wind (that blows) upwards (utpavana) , so that he thereby makes it (the butter) sacrificially pure.
sa utpunāti /	He clarifies it, with the text (Vâg. S.
savitustvā prasava utpunāmyacidreṇa pavitreṇa sūryasya raśmibhiriti so sāveva bandhuḥ //	'By the impulse of Savitri I purify thee with a flawless purifier (strainer), with the rays of the sun!' The meaning (of this formula) is the same (as before).

athājyamavekṣate /	He then looks down on the butter.

Yâgñavalkya, however, said in reference to this point,--'Why do not (the sacrificers) themselves become (act as) Adhvaryu priests? and why do not they (the sacrificers) themselves recite when far higher blessings are prayed for ? How can these (people) possibly have faith in this ? Whatever blessing the officiating priests invoke during the sacrifice that is for the benefit of the sacrificer alone.' The Adhvaryu should accordingly look down on it.
so 'vekṣate /	He looks down on it.

If, therefore, two persons were to come disputing with each other and saying, 'I have seen it!' 'I have heard it!' we should believe him who said, 'I have seen it!' and not the other: hence he thereby causes it (the butter) to increase by means of the truth.
so 'vekṣate / tejo 'si śukramasyamṛtamasīti sa eṣa satya eva mantrastejā hyetacukraṃ hyetadamṛtaṃ hyetattatsatyenaivaitatsamardhayati //	He looks down on it, with the text , 'Lustrous art thou! resplendent art thou! immortal (or, ambrosia) art thou!' That prayer is indeed true, for that (butter) is lustrous, it is resplendent, it is immortal: hence he thereby causes it to increase by that (prayer) which is true.
puruṣo vai yajñaḥ /	Now the sacrifice is the man.
puruṣastena yajño yadenam puruṣastanuta eṣa vai tāyamāno yāvāneva puruṣastāvānvidhīyate tasmātpuruṣo yajñaḥ //	The sacrifice is the man for the reason that the man spreads (performs) it; and that in being spread it is made of exactly the same extent as the man : this is the reason why the sacrifice is the man.
tasyeyameva juhūḥ / iyamupabhṛdātmaiva dhruvā tadvā ātmana evemāni sarvāṇyaṅgāni prabhavanti tasmādu dhruvāyā eva sarvo yajñaḥ prabhavati //	The guhû (spoon) further belongs to that (man-shaped sacrifice), and so does the upabhrit; and the dhruvâ represents its trunk. Now it is from thetrunk that all these limbs proceed, and for this reason the entire sacrifice proceeds from the dhruvâ.
prāṇa eva sruvaḥ /	The dipping-spoon (sruva, masc.) is no other than the breath.
so 'yam prāṇaḥ sarvāṇyaṅgānyanusaṃcarati tasmādu sruvaḥ sarvā anu srucaḥ saṃcarati //	This breath passes through (or, goes to) all the limbs, and for that reason the dipping-spoon goes to all the offering-spoons (sruk, fem.).
tasyāsāveva dyaurjuhūḥ /	That guhû further is to him no other than yonder sky, and the upabhrit this atmosphere, and the dhruvâ this same (earth).
athedamantarikṣamupabhṛdiyamevadhruvā tadvā asyā eveme sarve lokāḥ prabhavanti tasmādu dhruvāyā eva sarvo yajñaḥ prabhavati //	Now it is from this (earth) that all the worlds originate: and from the dhruvâ, therefore, the whole sacrifice proceeds.
ayameva sruvo yo 'yam pavate / so 'yamimāṃtsarvāṃllokānanupavate tasmādu sruvaḥ sarvā anu srucaḥ saṃcarati //	The dipping-spoon then is no other than that blowing one (the wind); it is this that sweeps across all these worlds: and for that reason the sruva goes to all the offering-spoons.

To the gods belongs what sacrificial food there is, to wit, king Soma and the sacrificial cake: all this he takes, while announcing it with the formula, 'I take thee, agreeable to so and so!' for thus it becomes theirs.
atha yānyājyāni gṛhyante / ṛtubhyaścaiva tāni candobhyaśca gṛhyante tattadanādiśyājyasyaiva rūpeṇa gṛhṇāti sa vai caturjuhvām gṛhṇātyaṣṭau kṛtva upabhṛti //	And whatever oblations of butter are taken, they are taken for the seasons and the metres. Every one of them he takes in the form of butter without announcing it (to any particular deity). In the guhû he takes of it four times (with the sruva from the pot), in the upabhrit eight times .
ṛtubhyastadgṛhṇāti prayājebhyo hi tadgṛhṇātyṛtavo hi prayājāstattadanādiśyājyasyaiva rūpeṇa gṛhṇātyajāmitāyai jāmi ha kuryādyadvasantāya tvā grīṣmāya tveti gṛhṇīyāttasmādanādiśyājyasyaiva rūpeṇa gṛhṇāti //	Now when he takes of it four times (with the sruva) in the guhû, he takes it for the seasons, sincehe takes it for the fore-offerings , and the fore-offerings are the seasons: all this he takes in the form of butter without making any announcement, in order to avoid sameness; for if he were to take it with the formulas 'For Spring (I take) thee!' 'For Summer--thee!' he would commit (the fault of) a repetition : he therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any announcement.

'For the Trishtubh--thee!' he would commit a repetition: he therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any announcement.
atha yaccaturdhruvāyāṃ gṛhṇāti / sarvasmai tadyajñāya gṛhṇāti tattadanādiśyājyasyaiva rūpeṇa gṛhṇāti kasmā u hyādiśedyataḥ sarvābhya eva devatābhyo 'vadyati tasmādanādiśyājyasyaiva rūpeṇa gṛhṇāti //	Again, when he takes four times (with the sruva)in the dhruvâ, he takes it for the whole sacrifice, and all this he takes in the form of butter without making any announcement. To whom indeed should he announce it, since he cuts it off for all the deities? He therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any announcement.
yajamāna eva juhūmanu /	Now the sacrificer stands behind the guhû, and he who means evil to him stands behind the upabhrit.
yo 'smā arātīyati sa upabhṛtamanvattaiva juhūmanvādya upabhṛtamanvattaiva juhūrādya upabhṛtsa vai caturjuhvāṃ gṛhṇātyaṣṭau kṛtva upabhṛti //	The eater stands behind the guhû, and what (or, he who) is to be eaten stands behind the upabhrit. And the guhû, indeed, is the eater, and the upabhrit is that which is to be eaten. In the guhû he takes four times (with the sruva), and in the upabhrit eight times.
attāramevaitatparimitataraṃ kanīyāṃsaṃ karotyatha yadaṣṭau kṛtva upabhṛti gṛhṇātyādyamevaitadaparimitataram bhūyāṃsaṃ karoti taddhi samṛddhaṃ yatrāttā kanīyānādyo bhūyān //	Now when he takes four times (butter) in the guhû, he thereby makes the eater more limited, smaller; and when he takes eight times in the upabhrit, he makes that which is to be eaten more unlimited, more abundant: for a flourishing condition indeed exists where the eater is smaller and that which is to be eaten more abundant.
bhūya ājyaṃ gṛhṇātyaṣṭau kṛtva upabhṛti gṛhṇankanīya ājyaṃ gṛhṇāti //	In taking four times in the guhû, he takes (altogether) more butter, and in taking eight times in the upabhrit he takes less butter.

And when, in taking eight times in the upabhrit, he takes less butter, he thereby, in making that which (or, him who) is to be eaten more unlimited, more abundant, makes it (or, him) vigourless and weaker. And thus a king who has established himself among a numberless people, subdues them even from a single dwelling,and takes possession of whatever he likes : with that very same energy (the Adhvaryu acts) when he takes a greater quantity of butter in the guhû. Now what he takes in the guhû, that he offers with the guhû; and what he takes in the upabhrit, that also he offers with the guhû.
kasmā u tarhyupabhṛti gṛhṇīyādyadupabhṛtā na juhotīti sa yaddhopabhṛtā juhuyātpṛthagghaivemāḥ prajāḥ syurnaivāttā syānnādyaḥ syādatha yattajjuhveva samānīya juhoti tasmādimā viśaḥ kṣatriyasyaiva vaśe sati vaiśyam paśava upatiṣṭante 'tha yattajjuhveva samānīya juhoti tasmādyadota kṣatriyaḥ kāmayate 'thāha vaiśya mayi yatte paro nihitaṃ tadāhareti taṃ jināti tvadyathā tvatkāmayate tathā sacata eteno hatadvīryeṇa //	And in reference to this point they say: 'Wherefore then is he to take it in the upabhrit, if he does not offer it with the upabhrit?' Now, if he were to offer it with the upabhrit, those subjects (of the king) would assuredly become separated from him, nor would there be either an eater or what is to be eaten. When, on the other hand, he pours (the butter) together and thus offers it with the guhû, thereby the people pay tribute to the Kshatriya. Hence by what he takes in the upabhrit, the Vaisya (man of the people), under the rule of the Kshatriya, becomes possessed of cattle; and when he pours (the butter) together and offers it with the guhû, thereby the Kshatriya, whenever he likes, says, 'Hallo Vaisya, just bring to me what thou hast stored away!' Thus he both subdues him and obtains possession of anything he wishes by dint of this very energy.
tāni vā etāni /	These butter-portions, then, are taken for the metres.

For the anushtubh is speech, and from speech all this (universe) springs: hence it is from the dhruvâ that the whole sacrifice originates. The anushtubh also is this (earth), and from it all this (universe) originates: hence it is from the dhruvâ that the whole sacrifice originates.

He thereby makes that butter the most favourite resort of the gods: for this reason he says, 'verily, thou art the favourite resort of the gods!'--'An unassailable means of worship!' the butter is indeed a thunderbolt: therefore he says, 'an unassailable means of worship!'

With the same formula he puts (butter) once into the upabhrit, seven times silently. With the same formula he puts once (butter) into the dhruvâ, three times silently. Now, as to this, they say, 'Thrice he should take with the formula in each case, for threefold is the sacrifice.' Nevertheless (it is done) only once with each (spoon), for it is just in this way that the taking thrice (with a formula) is accomplished.
sa idhmamevāgre prokṣati kṛṣṇo 'syākhareṣṭho 'gnaye tvā juṣṭam prokṣāmīti tanmedhyamevaitadagnaye karoti //	The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water, and sprinkles in the first place the fire-wood , with thetext , 'A black deer, living in the den, art thou ; I sprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni!' He thereby makes it sacrificially pure for Agni.
atha vedim prokṣati / vedirasi barhiṣe tvā juṣṭām prokṣāmi tanmedhyāmevaitadbarhiṣe karoti //	He then sprinkles he altar, with the text , 'Thou art the altar; I sprinkle thee, agreeable to the barhis (sacrificial-grass covering)!' He thereby makes it sacrificially pure for the grass covering.
athāsmai barhiḥ prayacati /	He (the Âgnîdhra) then hands the sacrificial grass to him (the Adhvaryu).
tatpurastādgranthyāsādayati tatprokṣati barhirasi srugbhyastvā juṣṭam prokṣāmi tanmedhyamevaitatsrugbhyaḥ karoti //	The latter puts it down (on the altar) with the knot turned to the east, and sprinkles it, with the text (Vâg. S. II, I), 'Barhis art thou! I sprinkle thee, agreeable to the spoons!' He thereby makes it sacrificially pure for the spoons.

Aditi, indeed, is this earth; hence it is for the latter that he thus moistens the roots of the plants: thereby these plants become root-moistened; and even if their tops are dry, their roots at least remain moist.
purastātprastaraṃ gṛhṇāti viṣṇo stupo 'sīti yajño vai viṣṇustasyeyameva śikhā stupa etāmevāsminnetaddadhāti purastādgṛhṇāti purastāddhyayaṃ stupastasmātpurastādgṛhṇāti //	Having thereupon untied the knot, he takes the prastara bunch from the front (of the barhis), with the text , 'Vishnu's crest art thou!' Vishnu, namely, is the sacrifice, and this (the prastara) is his top-knot or crest: this he thereby makes it at this sacrifice . From the front he takes it, because this top-knot also is (worn) on the front (of the head): for this reason he takes it from the front.
atha saṃnahanaṃ visraṃsayati /	He then undoes the band (of the barhis).
prakLptaṃ haivāsya strī vijāyata iti tasmātsaṃnahanaṃ visraṃsayati taddakṣiṇāyāṃ śroṇau nidadhāti nīvirhaivāsyaiṣā dakṣiṇata iva hīyaṃ nīvistasmāddakṣiṇāyāṃ śroṇau nidadhāti tatpunarabhicādayatyabhicanneva hīyaṃ nīvistasmātpunarabhicādayati //	'His (the sacrificer's) wife is sure to bring forth without difficulty ,' thinking thus he undoes the band. He puts it down on the right hip (of the altar); for this represents his (the sacrificer's) waist-band, and it is on the right side that the waist-band is (tied): this is the reason why he puts it down on the right hip. He again covers it over (with sacrificial grass); for the waist-band also is covered (by the upper garment): for this reason he again covers it.
atha barhi stṛṇāti /	He now spreads the barhis (on the altar).
ayaṃ vai stupaḥ prastaro 'tha yānyavāñci lomāni tānyevāsya yaditaram barhistānyevāsminnetaddadhāti tasmādbarhi stṛṇāti //	For the prastara is the top-knot; and this othersacrificial grass is for this (sacrifice) what other hair there is below that (top-knot, viz. the beard, &c.):--that (hair) he thereby puts on it, and for this reason he spreads the barhis.

tāvatī pṛthivyoṣadhayo barhistadasyāmevaitatpṛthivyāmoṣadhīrdadhāti tā imā asyām pṛthivyāmoṣadhayaḥ pratiṣṭhitāstasmādbarhi stṛṇāti //	As large as the altar is, so large is the earth; and the plants (are represented by) the barhis; so that he thereby furnishes the earth with plants; and those plants are firmly established in this earth: for this reason he spreads the barhis.

It is in favour of him (the sacrificer) who procures (the sacrificial grass), then, (that this is done.) He strews it threefold , for threefold is the sacrifice. Or he may also spread it whilst lifting up (the tops) ; forit has been said by the seer , 'They spread the barhis continuously.' He spreads it with the roots below (the tops); for it is with their roots below that those plants are firmly established in this earth: for this reason he spreads it with the roots below.

He trims it while holding the prastara (which he has received back from the Brahman) close over it; for the prastara is the top-knot, and it is this which he thereby puts on it: for this reason he trims (the fire) while holding the prastara close over it.
atha paridhīnparidadhāti /	He then lays the (three) enclosing-sticks (paridhi) around (the fire).

When at first the gods chose Agni for the office of Hotri, he said: 'Verily, I am not equal to this, that I should be your Hotri, and that I should carry your oblation. Already you have chosen three before,and they have passed away . Restore them to me: then I shall be equal to this, that I should be your Hotri and that I should carry your oblation!' They said, 'So be it!' and they restored to him those (three former Agnis): they are these enclosing-sticks.

Lest that thunderbolt, the vashat-call, should strike me down, enclose me by those (three Agnis, or paridhis); and thus that thunderbolt, the vashat-call, will not strike me down.' They said, 'So be it!' and they enclosed him with those (three sticks), and that thunderbolt, the vashat call, did not strike him down. When he encloses Agni with those (sticks) he buckles armour on him.
ta u haita ūcuḥ / idamu cedasmānyajñe yuṅkthāstvevāsmākamapi yajñe bhāga iti //	They (the other three Agnis) then said, 'If you join us with the sacrifice in this wise, then let us also have a share in the sacrifice!'

What shall fall outside the enclosure, that is offered unto you; and what they shall offer just upon you, that will sateyou; and what they shall offer up in the fire that will sate you!' Thus what they offer up in the fire, that satisfies them (the Agnis); and what they offer up just upon them (the enclosing-sticks, or Agnis), that satisfies them; and what is spilled outside the enclosure, that is offered to them : hence no sin attaches to what (butter) is spilt; for into this earth they entered (when they, the Agnis, passed away), and whatever is spilt here,--all that remains indeed in her.

'To the Lord of the World--svâhâ!' 'To the Lord of Beings--svâhâ!' These, indeed, are the names of those Agnis,--to wit, Lord of the Earth, Lord of the World, and Lord of Beings.

te vai pālāśāḥ syuḥ / brahma vai palāśo brahmāgniragnayo hi tasmātpālāśāḥ syuḥ //	Indeed, they should be of Palâsa wood[paragraph continues] (Butea Frondosa); for the Palâsa tree, doubtless, is the Brahman , and Agni also is the Brahman: for this reason the Agnis should be of Palâsa wood.

These, doubtless, are the trees that are suitable for sacrificial purposes, and from these trees they (the enclosing-sticks) are therefore (taken).

Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou (art) Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'
indrasya bāhurasi dakṣiṇo viśvasya ariṣṭyai yajamānasya paridhirasyagniriḍa īḍita iti //	He then lays down the southern one, with the text (ib.), 'Thou art Indra's arm for the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer; thou Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'

Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!' They are indeed Agnis, and for that reason he says, 'Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'
atha samidhamabhyādadhāti /	Thereupon he puts on (the fire) a samidh (kindling-stick).
sa madhyamamevāgre paridhimupaspṛṣati tenaitānagre samindhe 'thāgnāvabhyādadhāti teno agnim pratyakṣaṃ samindhe //	He first touches with it the middle enclosing-stick: thereby he first kindles those (three Agnis). After that he puts it on the fire: thereby he kindles the visible fire.

He thereby kindles the gâyatrî ; the gâyatrî, when kindled, kindles the other metres; and the metres, when kindled, carry the sacrifice to the gods.

He puts it on, with the formula , 'A kindler (samidh) art thou!' for the spring is indeed a kindler.

atha yāmevāmṛṃ tṛtīyāṃ samidhamabhyādadhāti / anuyājeṣu brāhmaṇameva tayā samindhe sa brāhmaṇaḥ samiddho devebhyo yajñaṃvahati //	By that third kindling-stick, then, which he puts on at the after-offerings , he kindles the officiating priest (brâhmana); and he, the priest, when kindled, carries the sacrifice to the gods.

The prastara bunch is indeed the top-knot (of the sacrifice); and he now lays down these two crosswise as its eye-brows: thereby these two (represent) the transverse eye-brows. The prastara, further,[paragraph continues] (represents) the kshatra (or military class); and the other barhis the vis (or, the common Âryan people);--(and the two stalks he puts down between them) for the sake of separating (vidhriti) the kshatra and the vis: for this reason he lays them down crosswise; and for this reason these two (stalks) are called vidhriti.

When he says 'thee, soft as wool,' he means to say 'agreeable to the gods;' and by 'pleasant to sit upon for the gods' he means to say 'forming a good seat for the gods.'

These three, that is, the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Âdityas, namely, are (classes of) gods; and these, he means to say, are to sit down on it.

The upabhrit (he takes), with the formula (ib.), 'Fond of butter art thou, Upabhritby name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and Upabhrit by name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort on the favourite seat!' The dhruvâ (he takes) with 'Fond of butter art thou, Dhruvâ by name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and Dhruvâ by name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort on the favourite seat!' What other sacrificial food there is, (he puts down on the prastara), with the formula, 'With the favourite resort sit down on the favourite seat!'
sa vā upari juhūṃ sādayati /	He lays the guhû down on (the prastara), and the other spoons down below, (viz.

Hence the people here serve, from a lower position, the Kshatriya seated above them: for this reason he places the guhû upon (the prastara) and the other spoons down below it.

Vishnu, assuredly, is the sacrifice: hence it is to the sacrifice that he makes all that over for protection.
indhe ha vā etadadhvaryuḥ /	This is the reason why he says, 'Protect these, O Vishnu!'
idhmenāgniṃ tasmādidhmo nāma samindhesāmidhenībhirhotā tasmātsāmidhenyo nāma //	With the fire-wood (idhma, lighting material) the Adhvaryu lights (indh) the fire: hence it is called fire-wood.

But let him not say so; for that (priest) is not a Hotri as yet; only when he (the sacrificer) elects him , does hebecome a Hotri.

In the gâyatrî metre (are the verses which) he recites; for the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: by means of its own metre he thereby kindles it. The gâyatrî is vigour, the gâyatrî is the brahman (the priestly order): with vigour he thereby kindles it.
ekādaśānvāha /	Eleven (verses) he recites; for of eleven syllables consists the trishtubh metre.
ekādaśākṣarā vai triṣṭubbrahma gāyatrī kṣatraṃ triṣṭubetābhyāmevainametadubhābhyāṃ vīryābhyāṃ samindhe tasmādekādaśānvāha //	The gâyatrî is the brahman and the trishtubh is the kshatra (or military order) . With the aid of these two energies he thus kindles it: for this reason he recites eleven (verses).

The fifteen-versed chant , doubtless, is the thunderbolt,and the thunderbolt means strength; so that he thereby converts the sâmidhenîs into strength: hence, if he should hate any one, he may crush him with his great toes at the time when those (verses) are recited. By saying, 'I here crush so and so!' he crushes him with that thunderbolt.
ardhamāsaśo vai saṃvatsaro bhavanneti tadrātrīrāpnoti // pañcadaśānāmu vai gāyatrīṇām /	Fifteen nights indeed there are in a half-moon; and growing by half-moons the year passes: hence he thereby obtains the nights.

For verily Pragâpati is all: hence for what wish he performs the ishti, that wish he thus accomplishes by means of the All. In a low voice he sacrifices to the deity; for what is spoken in a low voice is undefined (indistinct), and undefined is the 'All:' hence for whatever wish he performs the ishti, that wish he thus accomplishes by means of the All.
ekaviṃśatiṃ sāmidhenī /	This is the practice in regard to an ishti.

Twelve, doubtless, are the months of the year, five the seasons, and three these worlds: this (makes) twenty; and the twenty-first is this very (sun) that here shines: he is the resort, he the stay; thereby he (the sacrificer) obtains this resort, this stay.
tā haitā gataśrerevānubrūyāt /	He may therefore recite twenty-one.

For, what he for whom they recite is like, like that he will either be or worse , for whom, that knows this, they recitethose (twenty-one verses). This, however, is mere speculation, for those (twenty-one verses) are not recited .

Also three breaths there are in man: this recitation thereby causes him (the sacrificer) to be extended (santata), not cut short (by death).
sa yāvadasya vacaḥ syāt / evamevānuvivakṣettasyaitasya paricakṣīta sāmyavānyādanavānannanuvivakṣaṃstatkarma vivṛhyeta sā paricakṣā //	He (the Hotri) should endeavour to recite this (uninterruptedly) as long as his strength lasts. If, on the other hand, he were to take breath in the middle (of the verse), it would be a slight on this very (sacrifice) : by reciting this (holy) compositionwithout taking breath, that slight will be avoided.

The reason why he takes breath, is that the gâyatrî is indeed breath; and that by reciting a complete gâyatrî verse, he accordingly bestows complete breathing (on the sacrificer): let him therefore recite one (verse) at a time without breathing.

And in this way he gives no access to the spiteful enemy; but access he would indeed give, if he were to recite them discontinuously: he therefore recites in a continuous, uninterrupted way.

Sacrifice, they say, is not (performed) without the Sâman; and neither is the Sâman chanted without 'Hiṅ' having been uttered. By his uttering 'Hiṅ!' the peculiar nature (rûpam) of the word 'Hiṅ' is produced (in the sacrifice); and by the sacred syllable (om) it assumes the nature of the Sâman. By uttering 'Om! Om !' this his entire sacrifice becomes endowed with the Sâman.
yadveva hiṃkaroti /	And (another reason) why he utters 'Hiṅ!' is this.

The rik (verse) he recites with his voice. Now, voice and breath are a pair, so that a productive union of the sâmidhenîs is thereby effected at the outset: for this reason he recites, after uttering 'Hiṅ!'
sa vā upāṃśu hiṃkaroti /	He utters the word 'Hiṅ' in a low voice.

He thereby joins a gâyatrî verse directed hitherward to one directed away from here: the one which tends from hence carries the sacrifice to the gods, and the one which tends hitherward pleases the men.
yadveveti ca preti cānvāha /	And (another reason) why he recites with 'â' and 'pra,' is this.
preti vai prāṇa etyudānaḥ prāṇodānāvevaitaddadhāti tasmādvā eti ca preti cānvāha //	'Pra (forth)' clearly means out-breathing, and 'â (hither)' means in-breathing: hence he thereby obtains out-breathing and in-breathing (for the sacrificer). For this reason he recites with 'â' and 'pra.'
yadveveti ca preti cānvāha /	Yet (other reasons) why he recites with 'hither (â)' and 'thither (pra),' are these.
preti vai retaḥ sicyata eti prajāyate preti paśavo vitiṣṭanta eti samāvartante sarvaṃ vā idameti ca preti ca tasmādvā eti ca preti cānvāha //	'Thither' the seed is cast, and 'hither' birth takes place. 'Thither' the cattle disperse (for grazing), 'hither' they return. Indeed, everything here (moves) 'hither' and 'thither:' for this reason he recites with 'â' and 'pra.'
so 'nvāha /	He recites , 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!'--hereby, then, the 'thither' is (realised).
pra vo vājā abhidyava iti tannu preti bhavatyagna āyāhivītaya iti tadveti bhavati // tadu haika āhuḥ / ubhayaṃ vā etatpreti sampadyata iti tadu tadātivijñānyamiva pra vo vājā abhidyava iti tannu pretyagna āyāhi vītaya iti tadveti //	"And (in the second verse), 'Come hither, Agni, to expand !'--by this, on the other hand, the 'hither' is (realised). Now, in reference to this point, some people say, 'Both these (texts) surely result in a ""thither .""' This, however, is beyond the ordinary understanding: the text, 'forth go your viands, heavenward!' is clearly (directed) away from (the sacrificer); and the text, 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' is (directed) towards (him)."
so 'nvāha /	He recites (the first kindling verse), 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!' this, then, tends in a forward direction.
pra vo vājā abhidyava iti tannu preti bhavati vājā ityannaṃ vai vājā annamevaitadabhyanūktamabhidyava ityardhamāsā vā abhidyavo 'rdhamāsānevaitadabhyanūktaṃ haviṣmanta iti paśavo vai haviṣmantaḥ paśūnevaitadabhyanūktam //	'Viands' (vâga) he says, because viands mean food: hence food is obtained (for the sacrificer) by this recitation. 'Heavenward' he says, because those that tend heavenward are the half-moons:it is, therefore, the half-moons which he obtains by this recitation. 'In havis rich' he further says, because those that are rich in havis (milk, butter) are the cattle; it is cattle, therefore, that he thereby obtains through the recitation.
ghṛtācyeti /	'With buttered (spoon)--' he adds.

The Rishi Gotama Râhûgana was his family priest. When addressed (by the latter), he made no answer to him, fearing lest Agni might fall from his mouth.
tamṛgbhirhvayituṃ dadhre / vītihotraṃ tvā kave dyumantaṃ samidhīmahi agne bṛhantamadhvare videgheti //	He (the priest) began to invoke the latter withverses of the Rig-veda, 'We kindle thee at the sacrifice, O wise Agni, thee the radiant, the mighty caller to the sacrificial feast !--O Videgha!'

tarhi videgho māthava āsa /	Mâthava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvatî .

He burnt over (dried up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sadânîrâ,' flows from the northern (Himâlaya) mountain: that one he did not burn over.
prācīnam bahavo brāhmaṇāstaddhākṣetrataramivāsa srāvitaramivāsvaditamagninā vaiśvānareṇeti //	That one the Brâhmans did not cross in former times, thinking, 'it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaisvânara.' Now-a-days, however, there are many Brâhmans to the east of it.

Even in late summer that (river), as it were, rages along : so cold is it, not having been burnt over by Agni Vaisvânara.

'To the east of this (river) be thy abode!' said he. Even now this (river) forms the boundary of the Kosalas and Videhas; for these are the Mâthavas (or descendants of Mâthava).

He replied, 'Agni Vaisvânara was in my mouth; I did not reply, lest he should escape from my mouth.'

sa yatsāmidhenīṣu ghṛtavat / sāmidhenameva tatsamevainaṃ tenendhe vīryamevāsmindadhāti //	That (word) in the sâmidhenîs, therefore, which contains butter (ghrita) is especially suitable for kindling (sam-indh); and by it he accordingly kindles him (Agni, the fire) and bestows vigour on this (sacrificer).

Wishful of bliss, truly, is the sacrificer, since he wishes to approach the gods, to go to the gods: therefore he says, 'he nears the gods, wishful of bliss.' This (verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined (vague); and undefined, doubtless, is the 'All;' he thus commences (this holy work) with the All.
agna āyāhi vītaya iti / tadveti bhavati vītaya iti samantikamiva havā ime 'gre lokā āsurityunmṛśyā haiva dyaurāsa //	[He recites the second sâmidhenî]: 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!'--'To expand' he says, because at the beginning these worlds were well-nigh contiguous to one another: at that time one could touch the sky thus .

How could there be more space for us?' They breathed through them (the worlds) with these three syllables (forming the word) vîtaye ,' and these worlds became far apart from one another; and there was then ampler space for the gods: ample space, therefore, he will have for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse) containing (the word) 'vîtaye.'

'The giver of oblations ,' of course, is thesacrificer: hence 'invoked for the sacrificer' is what he thereby means to say.--'As Hotri on the barhis sit!' Agni, indeed, is the Hotri, and the barhis (the covering of sacrificial grass on the altar) is this world: hence he thereby establishes Agni (the fire) in this world, as this fire is established (or, beneficial, hita) in this world. This (verse), then, is recited with reference to this world (the earth): through it this world is conquered by him for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse).
taṃ tvā samidbhiraṅgira iti /	[He recites the third sâmidhenî]: 'With samidhs thee, O Aṅgiras!'--with samidhs (kindling-sticks), indeed, the Aṅgiras kindled him.

This (viz. ghritena, 'with butter') is a word which is especially suitable for the kindling of Agni: by it he kindles him, and bestows vigour on this (sacrificer).

This (verse) is recited with reference to yonder world, to wit, the aërial world; hence this (verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined, for undefined is yonder world: that world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this verse. [He recites the fourth sâmidhenî]: 'Agni, do thou obtain for us that (region) wide andglorious!' For wide, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods (dwell), and glorious is that (region) wherein the gods (dwell).
bṛhadagne suvīryāmiti /	When he says, 'Do thou obtain for us ,' he means to say, 'make us go to it!'

For great, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods (dwell), and mighty is that wherein the gods (dwell). This (verse), then, is recited with reference to yonder world: that heavenly world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse).

haviṣmanto hyetaṃ manuṣyā īdate tasmādāha taṃ haviṣmanta īḍata iti //	'With offerings him they glorify,' for with offerings men indeed glorify him; therefore he says, 'with offerings him they glorify.'
vṛṣaṇaṃ tvā vayaṃ vṛṣanvṛṣaṇaḥ samidhīmahīti /	[He recites the seventh sâmidhenî): 'O mighty one ! we mighty men do kindle thee, the mighty one!' for they indeed kindle him;--'O Agni, thee that brightly shines!' for he indeed shone brightly when he was kindled.

All these kindling verses, it is true, are addressed to Agni; Indra, however, is the deity of sacrifice, Indra is the mighty (hero); hence these his (the sacrificer's) kindling verses thereby become possessed of Indra: this is the reason why he recites the tristich containing the word 'mighty.' He recites [the eighth sâmidhenî]: 'Agni we choose as messenger!' Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Pragâpati, were contending for superiority.
so 'nvāha /	When they were thus contending, the gâyatrî stood between them.

Both parties then invited her secretly to come to them. Agni acted as messenger for the gods; and an Asura-Rakshas, named[paragraph continues] Saharakshas , for the Asuras. She then followed Agni: he therefore recites, 'Agni we choose for messenger,' because he was the messenger of the gods.--'As Hotri the all-knowing, him!' Here now some people recite, 'He who is the Hotri of the all-knowing ;' lest (in saying 'for Hotri, the all-knowing, him') one should say to oneself 'enough (i.e.

This, however, he should not do; for by (doing) so they do at the sacrifice what is human; and what is human, is inauspicious at a sacrifice. Therefore, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice, he should recite, just as it is recited by the Rik, 'for Hotri, the all-knowing, him!' [He continues], 'Performing well this sacrifice!' for he, Agni, is indeed a good performer of the sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'performing well this sacrifice.' She (gâyatrî, or the earth) sided with the gods, and the gods thereupon were victorious and the Asuras were defeated: and verily he for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse), is himself victorious and his adversaries are defeated.
tāṃ vā aṣṭamīmanubrūyāt /	He therefore recites this, the eighth sâmidhenî).
gāyatrī vā eṣā nidānenāṣṭākṣarā vai gāyatrī tasmādaṣṭamīmanubrūyāt // taddhaike /	This, indeed, is peculiarly a gâyatrî verse, since it is of eight syllables that the gâyatrî (metre) consists: for this reason he recites the eighth (sâmidhenî).

But let him not do this: for with him who inserts the additional verses before (the eighth), the latter (the eighth) is clearly out of its place , since in that case it (and the succeeding verse) become the tenth and eleventh verses. With him, on the other hand, for whom they recite this as the eighth (kindling verse), it is indeed in its proper place: let him therefore insert the two additional verses after (the ninth).

Previously to (the beginning of the tenth verse), 'O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit!' let him (the Adhvaryu) put onall the kindling-sticks with the exception of the one stick (which is to be put on at the after-offerings ); for it is now that the Hotri completes (the kindling); and what then is left of the kindling-sticks, other than the one stick, that is left (unused altogether); and what is left (unused) of the sacrifice, that is left for his (the sacrificer's) spiteful enemy: let him, therefore, previously to this (verse), put on all the samidhs, save one.

Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds, for your oblation-bearer choose!' by this (verse) he urges them on: 'make offerings and worship! do this for (the accomplishment) of whatever desire you kindled him!' this is what he thereby means to say. 'Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds,' he says, because cult means sacrifice: hence he thereby says, 'him, Agni, whilst the sacrifice proceeds;'--'for your oblation-bearer choose!' for he, Agni, is indeed the oblation-bearer, and for this reason he says 'for your oblation-bearer choose (him)!'
taṃ vā etam /	This tristich, containing (the word) 'cult (adhvara),' he thus recites.

O priest (brâhmana), O Bhârata!' for Agni, indeed, is the brahman[paragraph continues] (sacerdotium): therefore he says 'O Brâhmana!--O Bhârata' he says, because he (Agni) bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods: therefore they say 'Agni is bhârata (the bearer).' Or, he, being the breath, sustains (bhar) these creatures: therefore he says 'O Bhârata (sustainer)!'

This is the reason why he calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hotri).

Further, 'Celebrated by sages (kavi);' for those sages, the Rishis, indeed celebrated him: this is why he says 'celebrated by sages.'
brahmasaṃśita iti brahmasaṃśito hyeṣa ghṛtāhavana iti ghṛtāhavano hyeṣaḥ //	Further, 'Sharpened by the brahman (the Veda or vedic formulas),' for he is indeed sharpened by the brahman;--'the receiver of butter-offerings,' for he is indeed the receiver of butter-offerings.

rathīradhvarāṇāmiti / ratho ha vā eṣa bhūtvā devebhyo yajñaṃ vahati tasmādāha rathīradhvarāṇāmiti //	'The carrier (rathî) of sacrifices;' for being a cart (as it were) he conveys the sacrifice to thegods: this is the reason why he says 'the carrier of sacrifices.'

'The surpassing (tûrni, rather 'swift') bearer of oblations,' for he overcomes (tar) every evil: therefore he says 'the surpassing bearer of oblations .'

And, verily, whosoever knows this, obtains the vessel of him whose vessel he desires to obtain .
camaso devapāna iti / camasena ha vā etena bhūtena devā bhakṣayanti tasmādāha camaso devapāna iti //	Further, 'The cup from which the gods drink;' for from him, being (as it were) a cup, the gods drink (the Soma-libations): for this reason he says 'the cup from which the gods drink.'

'Bring Agni hither!' this he says in order that he (Agni) may bring Agni hither to that indispensable cake which is offered to Agni on both occasions (at the new- and the full-moon sacrifices).

When he says, 'offer up a good offering!' he means to say, 'sacrifice in the proper order!'

This is the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer while sitting.
yo ha vā agniḥ sāmidhenībhiḥ samiddhaḥ / atitarāṃ ha vai sa itarasmādagnestapatyanavadhṛṣyo hi bhavatyanavamṛśyaḥ //	The fire that has been kindled by means of the kindling verses, assuredly, blazes more brightly than any other fire; for, indeed, it is unassailable, unapproachable.

[He further recites the second verse], 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' the backward breathing (apâna) , doubtless, is of this nature: the backward breathing he accordingly kindles with this (verse).

agne dīdyatam bṛhaditi / cakṣurvai dīdayeva cakṣurevaitayā saminddhe //	Further, 'O Agni, thee, that brightly shines!' the eye, assuredly, shines: the eye he accordingly kindles by this (the seventh verse).

And whosoever knows that internal motive force of the breathings, him they regard as the internal motive force.

If any one were to curse him at the tenth (verse), he should say to him, 'Thereby thou hast put thine own down-breathing into the fire: by that down-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt die from constipation!' for this is what would take place.

In it, indeed, he makes these two first oblations to Mind and Speech (or, Voice); for mind and speech, when yoked together, convey the sacrifice to the gods.
tanmano devebhyo yajñaṃ vahatyatha yadvācā niruktaṃ kriyate tadvāgdevebhyo yajñaṃ vahatyetadvā idaṃ dvayaṃ kriyate tadete evaitatsaṃtarpayati tṛpte prīte devebhyo yajñaṃ vahāta iti //	Now, what is performed (with formulas, pronounced) in a low voice, by that the mind conveys the sacrifice to the gods; and what is performed (with formulas) distinctly uttered by speech, by that the speech conveys the sacrifice to the gods. And thus takes place here a twofold performance, wherebyhe gratifies these two, thinking, 'gratified and pleased, these two shall convey the sacrifice to the gods.'
sruveṇa tamāghārayati / yaṃ manasa āghārayati vṛṣā hi mano vṛṣā hi sruvaḥ //	With the dipping-spoon (sruva, m.) he makes that libation (of clarified butter) which he makes for the mind; for the mind (manas, n.!) is male, and male is the sruva.
srucā tamāghārayati / yaṃ vāca āghārayati yoṣā hi vāgyoṣā hi sruk //	With the offering-spoon (sruk, f.) he makes that libation which he makes for speech (vâk, f.); for speech is female, and female is the sruk.
tūṣṇīṃ tamāghārayati / yaṃ manasa āghārayati na svāheti canāniruktaṃ hi mano 'niruktaṃ hyetadyattūṣṇīm //	Silently (without a formula) and even without 'svâhâ (hail)!' he makes that libation which he makes for the mind; for undefined (or indistinct) is the mind, and undefined is what takes place silently.
mantreṇa tamāghārayati / yaṃ vāca āghārayati niruktā hi vāṅnirukto hi mantraḥ //	With a mantra he makes that libation which he makes for speech; for distinct is speech, and distinct is the formula.
āsīnastamāghārayati / yam manasa āghārayati tiṣṭhṃstaṃ yaṃ vāce manaśca ha vai vākca yujau devebhyo yajñaṃ vahato yataro vai yujorhrasīyānbhavatyupavahaṃ vai tasmai kurvanti vāgvai manaso hrasīyasyaparimitataramiva hi manaḥ parimitatareva hi vāktadvāca evaitadupavahaṃ karoti te sayujau devebhyo yajñaṃ vahatastasmāttiṣṭhanvāca āghārayati //	Sitting he makes that libation which he makes for the mind, and standing that which he makes for speech. Mind and speech, when yoked together, assuredly convey the sacrifice to the gods. But when one of two yoke-fellows is smaller (than the other) they give him a shoulder-piece . Now speech is indeed smaller than mind; for mind is by far the more unlimited, and speech is by far the more limited (of the two); hence he thereby (by standing) gives a shoulder-piece to speech, and as well-matched yoke-fellows these two now convey the sacrifice to the gods: for speech, therefore, he sprinkles while standing.
devā ha vai yajñaṃ tanvānāḥ /	Now the gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were afraid of a disturbance on the partof the Asuras and Rakshas.

When he makes a libation on each side (of the fire, north and south), this (pair), mind and speech, though indeed joined together, become separate: for one of the two libations is the head of the sacrifice and the other is its root.
sruveṇa tamāghārayati / yo mūlaṃ yajñasya srucā tamāghārayati yaḥ śiro yajñasya //	With the dipping-spoon (sruva) he makes that libation which is the root of the sacrifice, and with the offering-spoon (sruk) that which is the head of the sacrifice.
yo mūlam yajñasya tūṣṇīmiva hīdaṃmūlaṃ no hyatra vāgvadati //	Silently he makes that libation which is the root of the sacrifice; for silent, as it were, is this root (of trees &c.), and in it the voice does not sound.
mantreṇa tamāghārayati / yaḥ śiro yajñasya vāgghi mantraḥ śīrṣṇo hīyamadhi vāgvadati //	With a formula he makes that libation which is the head of the sacrifice; for the formula is speech, and from the head this speech sounds.
yo mūlaṃ yajñasya niṣaṇamiva hīdam mūlaṃ tiṣṭhaṃstamāghārayati yaḥ śiro yajñasya tiṣṭhatīva hīdaṃ śiraḥ //	Sitting he makes that libation which is the root of the sacrifice; for seated, as it were, is this root. Standing he makes that libation which is the head of the sacrifice; for this head stands, as it were.

In like manner as one would lay the yoke on (the shoulders of the team), so also he makes that first libation; for after laying on the yoke they fasten (the team to it).

sa sammārṣṭi /	While sweeping it he moves around, since in harnessing they move around the team.

He sweeps (once), with the text , 'O Agni, food-gainer! I cleanse thee, the food-gainer, who art about to hasten to the food!' Whereby he says, 'I cleanse thee who art going to convey the sacrifice (to the gods), thee fit for the sacrifice!' He then sweeps thrice over (the fire) silently: for just as, after harnessing (the animal), one urges it on, saying, 'Go on! pull!' so does he thereby strike it with the lash , thinking, 'Go on and convey the sacrifice to the gods!' That is why he (sweeps) thrice over it silently; and in like manner as this act is performed between (the two sprinklings of butter), so this mind and speech, though forming one, thereby become, as it were, separate.

'Svadhâ to the fathers!' Thereby he propitiates the gods and the fathers, now thathe is about to perform the duties of the sacrificial priest. With the formula, 'May ye two be easy to manage for me!' he takes the two offering-spoons: he thereby means to say, 'May ye two be easy to handle for me; may I be able to handle you!'--He further says , 'May I this day offer up the butter to the gods unspilt!' whereby he means to say, 'May I to-day perform an undisturbed sacrifice to the gods!'

Vishnu, indeed, is the sacrifice: it is the latter therefore that he propitiates by saying, 'may I not sin against thee!' Further, 'May I step into thy wealth-abounding shade, O Agni!' whereby he says, 'may I step into thy auspicious shade, O Agni !'

Vishnu, indeed, is the sacrifice, and near to this he now stands: this is why he says, 'thou art the abode of Vishnu!'--'Here Indra performed his heroic deed ;' for it was while standing in this place that Indra drove off towards the south the evil spirits, the Rakshas: for this reason he says, 'here Indra performed his heroic deed.'--'Erect stood the cult;' cult,namely, means sacrifice, hence he thereby says 'erect stood the sacrifice.'

Guard thou earth and heaven!' there is nothing obscure in this.--'Indra, by this butter-oblation, may be the maker of good offering (svishtakrit) for the gods! Svâhâ!' Indra, indeed, is the deity of sacrifice; therefore he says 'Indra, by this butter-oblation . .
athāsaṃsparśayantsrucau paryetya /	. .' Having then returned (to his former position behind the altar), without letting the two offering-spoons touch each other, he mixes (some of the butter left in the guhû) with (that in) the dhruvâ.

And the second libation, moreover, is the head of the sacrifice, and the head (siras) represents excellence (srî), for the head does indeed represent excellence: hence, of one who is the most excellent (sreshtha) of a community, people say that he is 'the head of that community.'
yajamāna eva dhruvāmanu /	The sacrificer, assuredly, stands behind the dhruvâ, and he who means evil to him stands behind the upabhrit .

sa samanakti / saṃ jyotiṣā jyotiriti jyotirvā itarasyāmājyam bhavati jyotiritarasyāṃ te hyetadubhe jyotiṣī saṃgacete tasmādevaṃ samanakti //	He mixes it, with the text , 'Light with light!' for light (lustre), indeed, is the butter in the one (spoon) and light also is that in the other. Thereby these two lights unite with each other, and for this reason he mixes (the butter) in this manner.
athāto manasaścaiva vācaśca / ahambhadra uditam manaśca ha vai vākcāhambhadra ūdāte //	Now a dispute once took place between Mind and Speech as to which was the better of the two.
taddha mana uvāca /	Both Mind and Speech said, 'I am excellent!'
ahameva tvacreyo 'smi na vai mayā tvaṃ kiṃ canānabhigataṃ vadasi sā yanmama tvaṃ kṛtānukarānuvartmāsyahameva tvacreyo 'smīti //	Mind said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for thou dost not speak anything that is not understood by me; and since thou art only an imitator of what is done by me and a follower in my wake, I am surely better than thou!'
ahameva tvacreyasyasmi yadvai tvaṃ vetthāhaṃ tadvijñapayāmyahaṃ saṃjñapayāmīti //	Speech said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for what thou knowest I make known, I communicate.'

sā ha vākparoktā visiṣmiye /	Then Speech (vâk, fem.) being thus gainsaid, was dismayed and miscarried.

Hence whatever at the sacrifice is performed for Pragâpati, that is performed in a low voice; for speech would not act as oblation-bearer for Pragâpati.

They asked: 'Is it here (atra)?' and therefore it developed into Atri. For the same reason one becomes guilty by (intercourse) with a woman who has just miscarried (âtreyî); for it is from that woman, from the goddess Speech, that these (germs) originate .
sa vai pravarāyāśrāvayati /	He (the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of the Hotri) .
tadyatpravarāyāśrāvayati yajño vā āśrāvaṇaṃ yajñamabhivyāhṛtyātha hotāram pravṛṇā iti tasmātpravarāyāśrāvayati //	The reason why he utters his call, is that the (Adhvaryu's) call isthe sacrifice: 'having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the Hotri,' thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for the Pravara.
sa yadvānārabhy a yajñamadhvaryurāśrāvayedvepano vā ha syādanyāṃ vārttimārcet //	He utters his call after taking the fuel-band; for if the Adhvaryu were to utter his call without taking hold of the sacrifice, he would either be unsteady or meet with some other ailment.

Let him, however, not do this; for that also wherewith the firewood was tied together and wherewith they sweep the fire is, doubtless, something belonging to the sacrifice; and thus indeed he utters his call after taking hold of the sacrifice: for this reason let him utter the call after taking the fuel-band.

Thereby he propitiates both Agni and the gods: for by first choosing Agni, he propitiates Agni;and by first choosing him who is the Hotri of the gods, he propitiates the gods.

'May he worship, knowing the gods , he the thoughtful one,'--for he, Agni, indeed, knows the gods well: hence, he thereby says 'may he who knows them well worship (them) in due form!

Or, say they, (it means) 'at the sacrifice of Manu,' and therefore he says 'as (he did) with Manu.'
bharatavaditi / eṣa hi devebhyo havyam bharati tasmādbharato 'gnirityāhureṣa u vā imāḥ prajāḥ prāṇo bhūtvā bibharti tasmādvevāha bharatavaditi //	'Like as (with) Bharata,'--for, say they, he bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods, hence Bharata (the bearer) is Agni; or, say they, he, having become the breath, supports (bhar) these creatures, and therefore he says 'like as Bharata.'

ṛṣibhyaścaivainametaddevebhyaśca nivedayatyayam mahāvīryo yo yajñam prāpaditi tasmādārṣeyam pravṛṇīte //	He thus introduces him both to the (ancestral) rishis and to the gods (as if he were saying), 'he is of mighty strength who obtained the sacrifice!' for this reason he chooses (him as) the ancestral one.
parastādarvākpravṛṇīte /	He chooses from the remote end (of the sacrificer's ancestral line) downwards; for it is from theremote end downwards that a race is propagated.
parastāddhyarvācyaḥ prajāḥ prajāyante jyāyasaspataya u caivaitannihnuta idaṃ hi pitaivāgre 'tha putro 'tha pautrastasmātparastādarvākpravṛṇite //	Thereby he also propitiates the lord of seniority; for here among men the father comes first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he chooses from the remote end downwards.
sa ārṣeyamuktvāha / brahmaṇvaditi brahma hyagnistasmādāha brahmaṇvadityā ca vakṣaditi tadyā evaitaddevatā āvoḍhavā āha tā evaitadāhā ca vakṣaditi //	Having named the ancestral, he says, 'Like as, Brahman;'--for Agni is the Brahman (the Veda, or the sacerdotium), and therefore he says 'like as Brahman;'--'may he bring (the gods) hither!' what deities he bids him bring hither, those he refers to in saying 'may he bring (them) hither.'

asau mānuṣa iti / tadimam mānuṣaṃ hotāraṃ pravṛṇīte hotā haiṣa purāthaitarhi hotā //	is the man,' thereby he chooses this man for his Hotri; heretofore he was not a Hotri, but now he is a Hotri.

O Pûshan! O Brihaspati! speak forth and offer up sacrifice (pra-yag)!'--he (the Hotri), namely, will have to recite the anuvâkyâs and the yâgyâs ; he therefore now propitiates those gods: do ye recite, 'do ye offer!' thus (he thereby says).

mano vā adhvaryurvāgghotā tanmanaścaivaitadvācaṃ ca saṃdadhāti // tatra japati /	He now touches the Adhvaryu and the Âgnîdhra: for the Adhvaryu is the mind, and the Hotri is, speech: thus he thereby brings mind and speech together.

""off-wealth"")!' Formerly, namely, the Hotri of the Asuras was one Parâvasu by name: him he thereby ejects from the Hotri's seat."
atha hotṛṣadana upaviśati /	He then sits down on the Hotri's seat, with the formula, 'I here sit down on the seat of the wealth-bestower (arvâvasu, lit.
idamahamarvāvasoḥ sadane sīdāmītyarvāvasurvai nāma devānāṃ hotā tasyaivaitatsadane sīdati //	hither-wealth)!' for one Arvâvasu by name was the Hotri of the gods , and on his seat he accordingly sits down.

'Agni's priestly duty' he says, because it is his duty that he must know;--'that means of salvation ,'--the means of salvation, assuredly, is the sacrifice: 'may he know the sacrifice' is what he thereby says.--'Favourable to thee, O Sacrificer, isthe deity!' by this he says 'favourable is the deity to thee, O Sacrificer, whose Hotri is Agni !'--'Take up the spoon, O Adhvaryu, full of butter!' thereby he urges on the Adhvaryu.

Behind the guhû stands the eater, and behind the upabhrit the one to be eaten; and if he were to speak of two (spoons), he would make the one to be eaten countervail the eater.
