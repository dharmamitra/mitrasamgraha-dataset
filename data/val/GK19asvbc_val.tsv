śrutvā tataḥ strījanavallabhānāṃ manojñabhāvaṃ purakānanānām | bahiḥprayāṇāya cakāra buddhimaṃtargṛhe nāga ivāvaruddhaḥ ||	Having heard of the delightful appearance of the city groves beloved by the women, he resolved to go out of doors, like an elephant long shut up in a house.
tato nṛpastasya niśamya bhāvaṃ putrābhidhānasya manorathasya | snehasya lakṣmyā vayasaśca yogyām-ājñāpayāmāsa vihārayātrām ||	The king, having learned the character of the wish thus expressed by his son, ordered a pleasure-party to be prepared, worthy of his own affection and his son’s beauty and youth.

tāḥ srastakāṃcīguṇavighnitāśca suptaprabuddhākulalocanāśca | vṛttāṃtavinyastavibhūṣaṇāśca kautūhalenāpi bhṛtāḥ parīyuḥ ||	Hindered by the strings of their girdles which had slipped down, with their eyes bewildered as just awakened from sleep, and with their ornaments hastily put on in the stir of the news, and filled with curiosity, they crowded round;
prāsādasopānatalapraṇādaiḥ kāṃcīravairnūpuranisvanaiśca | vibhrāmayaṃtyo gṛhapakṣisaṃghānanyonyavegāṃśca samākṣipaṃtyaḥ ||	Frightening the flocks of birds which lived in the houses, with the noise of their girdles and the jingling of their anklets which resounded on the staircases and roofs of the mansions, and mutually reproaching one another for their hurry.
kāsāṃcidāsāṃ tu varāṃganānāṃ jātatvarāṇāmapi sotsukānām | gatiṃ gurutvājjagṛhurviśālāḥ śroṇīrathāḥ pīnapayodharāśca ||	Some of these women, even in their haste as they rushed longing to see, were delayed in their going by the weight of their hips and full bosoms.
śīghraṃ samarthāpi tu gaṃtumanyā gatiṃ nijagrāha yayau na tūrṇam | hriyā pragalbhāni nigūhamānā rahaḥ prayuktāni vibhūṣaṇāni ||	Another, though well able to go herself, checked her pace and forbore to run, hiding with shame her ornaments hitherto worn only in seclusion, and now too boldly displayed.
parasparotpīḍanapiṃḍitānāṃ saṃmardasaṃśobhitakuṃḍalānām | tāsāṃ tadā sasvanabhūṣaṇānāṃ vātāyaneṣvapraśamo babhūva ||	There they were restlessly swaying about in the windows, crowded together in the mutual press, with their earrings polished by the continual collision and their ornaments all jingling.

ka eṣa bhoḥ sūta naro 'bhyupetaḥ keśaiḥ sitairyaṣṭiviṣaktahastaḥ | bhrūsaṃvṛtākṣaḥ śithilānatāṃgaḥ kiṃ vikriyaiṣā prakṛtiryadṛcchā ||	‘Who is this man that has come here, O charioteer, with white hair and his hand resting on a staff, his eyes hidden beneath his brows, his limbs bent down and hanging loose, — is this a change produced in him or his natural state or an accident?’
ityevamuktaḥ sa rathapraṇetā nivedayāmāsa nṛpātmajāya | saṃrakṣyamapyarthamadoṣadarśī taireva devaiḥ kṛtabuddhimohaḥ ||	Thus addressed, the charioteer revealed to the king’s son the secret that should have been kept so carefully, thinking no harm in his simplicity, for those same gods had bewildered his mind:
rūpasya hartrī vyasanaṃ balasya śokasya yonirnidhanaṃ ratīnām | nāśaḥ smṛtīnāṃ ripuriṃdriyāṇāmeṣā jarā nāma yayaiṣa bhagnaḥ ||	‘That is old age by which he is broken down, — the ravisher of beauty, the ruin of vigour, the cause of sorrow, the destruction of delights, the bane of memories, the enemy of the senses.
pītaṃ hyanenāpi payaḥ śiśutve kālena bhūyaḥ parimṛṣṭamurvyām | krameṇa bhūtvā ca yuvā vapuṣmān krameṇa tenaiva jarāmupetaḥ ||	‘He too once drank milk in his childhood, and in course of time he learned to grope on the ground; having step by step become a vigorous youth, he has step by step in the same way reached old age.’
ityevamukte calitaḥ sa kiṃcidrājātmajaḥ sūtamidaṃ babhāṣe | kimeṣa doṣo bhavitā mamāpītyasmai tataḥ sārathirabhyuvāca ||	Being thus addressed, the prince, starting a little, spoke these words to the charioteer, ‘What! will this evil come to me also?’ and to him again spoke the charioteer:
āyuṣmato 'pyeṣa vayaḥprakarṣānniḥsaṃśayaṃ kālavaśena bhāvī | evaṃ jarāṃ rūpavināśayitrīṃ jānāti caivecchati caiṣa lokaḥ ||	‘It will come without doubt by the force of time through multitude of years even to my long-lived lord; all the world knows thus that old age will destroy their comeliness and they are content to have it so.’
tataḥ sa pūrvāśayaśuddhabuddhirvistīrṇakalpācitapuṇyakarmā | śrutvā jarāṃ saṃvivije mahātmā mahāśanerghoṣamivāṃtike gauḥ ||	Then he, the great-souled one, who had his mind purified by the impressions of former good actions, who possessed a store of merits accumulated through many preceding aeons, was deeply agitated when he heard of old age, like a bull who has heard the crash of a thunderbolt close by.
niḥśvasya dīrghaṃ sa śiraḥ prakaṃpya tasmiṃśca jīrṇe viniveśya cakṣuḥ | tāṃ caiva dṛṣṭvā janatāṃ saharṣāṃ vākyaṃ sa saṃvignamidaṃ jagāda ||	Drawing a long sigh and shaking his head, and fixing his eyes on that decrepit old man, and looking round on that exultant multitude he then uttered these distressed words:
evaṃ jarā haṃti ca nirviśeṣaṃ smṛtiṃ ca rūpaṃ ca parākramaṃ ca | na caiva saṃvegamupaiti lokaḥ pratyakṣato 'pīdṛśamīkṣamāṇaḥ ||	‘Old age thus strikes down all alike, our memory, comeliness, and valour; and yet the world is not disturbed, even when it sees such a fate visibly impending.
evaṃ gate sūta nivartayāśvān śīghraṃ gṛhāṇyeva bhavānprayātu | udyānabhūmau hi kuto ratirme jarābhave cetasi vartamāne ||	‘Since such is our condition, O charioteer, turn back the horses, — go quickly home; how can I rejoice in the pleasure-garden, when the thoughts arising from old age overpower me?’
athājñayā bhartṛsutasya tasya nivartayāmāsa rathaṃ niyaṃtā | tataḥ kumāro bhavanaṃ tadeva ciṃtāvaśaḥ śūnyamiva prapede ||	Then the charioteer at the command of the king’s son turned the chariot back, and the prince lost in thought entered even that royal palace as if it were empty.
yadā tu tatraiva na śarma lebhe jarā jareti praparīkṣamāṇaḥ | tato nareṃdrānumataḥ sa bhūyaḥ krameṇa tenaiva bahirjagāma ||	But when he found no happiness even there, as he continually kept reflecting, ‘old age, old age,’ then once more, with the permission of the king, he went out with the same arrangement as before.
athāparaṃ vyādhiparītadehaṃ ta eva devāḥ sasṛjurmanuṣyam | dṛṣṭvā ca taṃ sārathimābabhāṣe śauddhodanistadgatadṛṣṭireva ||	Then the same deities created another man with his body all afflicted by disease; and on seeing him the son of Śuddhodana addressed the charioteer, having his gaze fixed on the man:
sthūlodaraḥ śvāsacalaccharīraḥ srastāṃsabāhuḥ kṛśapāṇdugātraḥ | aṃbeti vācaṃ karuṇaṃ bruvāṇaḥ paraṃ samāśliṣya naraḥ ka eṣaḥ ||	‘Yonder man with a swollen belly, his whole frame shaking as he pants, his arms and shoulders hanging loose, his body all pale and thin, uttering plaintively the word “mother,” when he embraces a stranger, — who, pray, is this?’
tato 'bravītsārathirasya saumya dhātuprakopaprabhavaḥ pravṛddhaḥ | rogābhidhānaḥ sumahānanarthaḥ śakro 'pi yenaiṣa kṛto 'svataṃtraḥ ||	Then his charioteer answered, ‘Gentle Sir, it is a very great affliction called sickness, that has grown up, caused by the inflammation of the (three) humours, which has made even this strong man  no longer master of himself.’
ityūcivān rājasutaḥ sa bhūyastaṃ sānukaṃpo naramīkṣamāṇaḥ | asyaiva jātaḥ pṛthageṣa doṣaḥ sāmānyato rogabhayaṃ prajānām ||	Then the prince again addressed him, looking upon the man compassionately, ‘Is this evil peculiar to him or are all beings alike threatened by sickness?’
tato babhāṣe sa rathapraṇetā kumāra sādhāraṇa eṣa doṣaḥ | evaṃ hi rogaiḥ paripīḍyamāno rujāturo harṣamupaiti lokaḥ ||	Then the charioteer answered, ‘O prince, this evil is common to all; thus pressed round by diseases men run to pleasure, though racked with pain.’
iti śrutārthaḥ sa viṣaṇṇacetāḥ prāvepatāṃbūrmigataḥ śaśīva | idaṃ ca vākyaṃ karuṇāyamānaḥ provāca kiṃcinmṛdunā svareṇa ||	Having heard this account, his mind deeply distressed, he trembled like the moon reflected in the waves of water; and full of sorrow he uttered these words in a low voice:
idaṃ ca rogavyasanaṃ prajānāṃ paśyaṃśca viśraṃbhamupaiti lokaḥ | vistīrṇavijñānamaho narāṇāṃ hasaṃti ye rogabhayairamuktāḥ ||	‘Even while they see all this calamity of diseases mankind can yet feel tranquillity; alas for the scattered intelligence of men who can smile when still not free from the terrors of disease!
nivartyatāṃ sūta vahiḥprayāṇānnareṃdrasadmaiva rathaḥ prayātu | śrutvā ca me rogabhayaṃ ratibhyaḥ pratyāhataṃ saṃkucatīva cetaḥ ||	‘Let the chariot, O charioteer, be turned back from going outside, let it return straight to the king’s palace; having heard this alarm of disease, my mind shrinks into itself, repelled from pleasures.’
tato nivṛttaḥ sa nivṛttaharṣaḥ pradhyānayuktaḥ praviveśa sadma | taṃ dvistathā prekṣya ca saṃnivṛttaṃ puryāgamaṃ bhūmipatiścakāra ||	Then having turned back, with all joy departed, he entered his home, absorbed in thought; and having seen him thus return a second time, the king himself entered the city.
śrutvā nimittaṃ tu nivartanasya saṃtyaktamātmānamanena mene | mārgasya śaucādhikṛtāya caiva cukrośa ruṣṭo 'pi ca nogradaṃḍaḥ ||	Having heard the occasion of the prince’s return he felt himself as deserted by him, and, although unused to severe punishment, even when displeased, he rebuked him whose duty it was to see that the road was clear.
bhūyaśca tasmai vidadhe sutāya viśeṣayuktaṃ viṣayaprakāram | caleṃdriyatvādapi nāpi śakto nāsmānvijahyāditi nāthamānaḥ ||	And once more he arranged for his son all kinds of worldly enjoyments to their highest point; imploring in his heart, ‘Would that he might not be able to forsake us, even though rendered unable only through the restlessness of his senses.’
yadā ca śabdādibhiriṃdriyārthairaṃtaḥpure naiva suto 'sya reme | tato vahirvyādiśati sma yātrāṃ rasāntaraṃ syāditi manyamānaḥ ||	But when in the women’s apartments his son found no pleasure in the several objects of the senses, sweet sounds and the rest, he gave orders for another progress outside, thinking to himself,  ‘It may create a diversion of sentiment.’
snehācca bhāvaṃ tanayasya buddhvā saṃvegadoṣānaviciṃtya kāṃścit | yogyāḥ samājñāpayati sma tatra kalāsvabhijña iti vāramukhyāḥ ||	And in his affection pondering on the condition of his son, never thinking of any ills that might come from his haste, he ordered the best singing-women to be in attendance, as well-skilled in all the soft arts that can please.
tato viśeṣeṇa nareṃdramārge svalaṃkṛte caiva parīkṣite ca | vyatyāsya sūtaṃ ca rathaṃ ca rājā prasthāpayāmāsa bahiḥ kumāram ||	Then the royal road being specially adorned and guarded, the king once more made the prince go out, having ordered the charioteer and chariot to proceed in a contrary direction (to the previous one).
tatastathā gacchati rājaputre taireva devairvihito gatāsuḥ | taṃ caiva mārge mṛtamuhyamānaṃ sūtaḥ kumāraśca dadarśa nānyaḥ ||	But as the king’s son was thus going on his way, the very same deities created a dead man, and only the charioteer and the prince, and none else, beheld him as he was carried dead along the road.
athābravīdrājasutaḥ sa sūtaṃ naraiścaturbhirhriyate ka eṣaḥ | dīnairmanuṣyairanugamyamāno yo bhūṣito 'śvāsyavarudyate ca ||	Then spoke the prince to the charioteer, ‘Who is this borne by four men, followed by mournful companions, who is bewailed, adorned but no longer breathing?’
tataḥ sa śuddhātmabhireva devaiḥ śuddhādhivāsairabhibhūtacetāḥ | avācyamapyarthamimaṃ niyaṃtā pravyājahārārthavidīśvarāya ||	Then the driver, — having his mind overpowered by the gods who possess pure minds and pure dwellings, — himself knowing the truth, uttered to his lord this truth also which was not to be told:
buddhīṃdriyaprāṇaguṇairviyuktaḥ supto visaṃjñastṛṇakāṣṭhabhūtaḥ | saṃbadhya saṃrakṣya ca yatnavadbhiḥ priyāpriyaistyajyata eṣa ko 'pi ||	‘This is some poor man who, bereft of his intellect, senses, vital airs and qualities, lying asleep and unconscious, like mere wood or straw, is abandoned alike by friends and enemies after they have carefully swathed and guarded him.’
iti praṇetuḥ sa niśamya vākyaṃ saṃcukṣubhe kiṃciduvāca cainam | kiṃ kevalasyaiva janasya dharmaḥ sarvaprajānāmayamīdṛśo 'ṃtaḥ ||	Having heard these words of the charioteer he was somewhat startled and said to him, ‘Is this an accident peculiar to him alone, or is such the end of all living creatures?’
tataḥ praṇetā vadati sma tasmai sarvaprajānāmayamaṃtakarmā | hīnasya madhyasya mahātmano vā sarvasya loke niyato vināśaḥ ||	Then the charioteer replied to him, ‘This is the final end of all living creatures; be it a mean man, a man of middle state, or a noble, destruction is fixed to all in this world.’
tataḥ sa dhīro 'pi nareṃdrasūnuḥ śrutvaiva mṛtyuṃ viṣasāda sadyaḥ | aṃsena saṃśliṣya ca kūbarāgraṃ provāca nihrādavatā svareṇa ||	Then the king’s son, sedate though he was, as soon as he heard of death, immediately sank down overwhelmed, and pressing the end of the chariotpole with his shoulder spoke with a loud voice,
iyaṃ ca niṣṭhā niyataṃ prajānāṃ pramādyati tyaktabhayaśca lokaḥ | manāṃsi śaṃke kaṭhināni nsup>oṇāṃ svasthāstathā hyadhvani vartamānāḥ ||	‘Is this end appointed to all creatures, and yet the world throws off all fear and is infatuated! Hard indeed, I think, must the hearts of men be, who can be self-composed in such a road.
tasmādrathaṃ sūta nivartyatāṃ no vihārabhūmau na hi deśakālaḥ | jānanvināśaṃ kathamārttikāle sacetanaḥ syādiha hi pramattaḥ ||	‘Therefore, O charioteer, turn back our chariot, this is no time or place for a pleasure-excursion; how can a rational being, who knows what destruction is, stay heedless here, in the hour of calamity?’
iti bruvāṇe 'pi narādhipātmaje nivartayāmāsa sa naiva taṃ ratham | viśeṣayuktaṃ tu nareṃdraśāsanātsa padmakhaṃḍaṃ vanameva niryayau ||	Even when the prince thus spoke to him, the charioteer did not turn the chariot back; but at his peremptorily reiterated command he retired to the forest Padmakhaṇḍa.
tataḥ śivaṃ kusumitabālapādapaṃ paribhramatpramuditamattakokilam | vipānavatsakamalacārudīrghikaṃ dadarśa tadvanamiva naṃdanaṃ vanam ||	There he beheld that lovely forest like Nandana itself, full of young trees in flower with intoxicated kokilas wandering joyously about, and with its bright lakes gay with lotuses and well-furnished with watering-places.
varāṃganāgaṇakalilaṃ nṛpātmajastato balādvanamabhinīyate sma tat | varāpsaronṛtyamalakādhipālayaṃ navavrato muniriva vighnakātaraḥ ||	The king’s son was perforce carried away to that wood filled with troops of beautiful women, just as if some devotee who had newly taken his vow were carried off, feeling weak to withstand temptation, to the palace of the monarch of Alakā,  gay with the dancing of the loveliest heavenly nymphs.
tataḥ śamavihārasya munerikṣvākucaṃdramāḥ | arāḍasyāśramaṃ bheje vapuṣā pūrayanniva ||	Then the moon of the Ikṣvāku race turned towards the hermitage of the sage Arāḍa  of tranquil life, — as it were, doing honour to it by his beauty.
sa kālāmasagotreṇa tenālokyaiva dūrataḥ | uccaiḥ svāgatamityuktaḥ samīpamupajagmivān ||	He drew near, on being addressed in a loud voice ‘Welcome’ by the kinsman of Kālāma, as he saw him from afar.
tāvubhau nyāyataḥ pṛṣṭvā dhātusāmyaṃ parasparam | dāravyormedhyayorvṛṣyoḥ śucau deśe niṣīdatuḥ ||	They, having mutually asked after each other’s health as was fitting, sat down in a clean place on two pure wooden seats.
tamāsīnaṃ nṛpasutaṃ so 'bravīnmunisattamaḥ | bahumānaviśālābhyāṃ darśanābhyāṃ pibanniva  ||	The best of sages, having seen the prince seated, and as it were drinking in the sight of him with eyes opened wide in reverence, thus addressed him:
viditaṃ me yathā saumya niṣkrāṃto bhavanādasi | chittvā snehamayaṃ pāśaṃ pāśaṃ dṛpta iva dvipaḥ ||	‘I know, gentle youth, how thou hast come forth from thy home, having severed the bond of affection, as a wild elephant its cord.
sarvathā dhṛtimaccaiva prājñaṃ caiva manastava | yastvaṃ prāptaḥ śriyaṃ tyaktvā latāṃ viṣaphalāmiva ||	‘In every way thy mind is stedfast and wise, who hast come here after abandoning royal luxury like a creeper-plant with poisonous fruit.
nāścaryaṃ jīrṇavayaso yajjagmuḥ pārthivā vanam | apatyebhyaḥ śriyaṃ dattvā bhuktocchiṣṭāmiva srajam ||	‘It is no marvel that kings have retired to the forest who have grown old in years, having given up their glory to their children, like a garland left behind after being used.
idaṃ me matamāścaryaṃ nave vayasi yadbhavān | abhuktveva śriyaṃ prāptaḥ sthito viṣayagocare ||	‘But this is to me indeed a marvel that thou art come hither in life’s fresh prime, set in the open field of the world’s enjoyments, ere thou hast as yet tasted of their happiness.
tadvijñātumimaṃ dharmaṃ paramaṃ bhājanaṃ bhavān | jñānapūrvamadhiṣṭhāya śīghraṃ duḥkhārṇavaṃ tara ||	‘Verily thou art a worthy vessel to receive this highest religion; having mastered it with full knowledge, cross at once over the sea of misery.
śiṣye yadyapi vijñāte śāstraṃ kālena vartate | gāṃbhīryādvyavasāyācca suparīkṣyo bhavān mama ||	‘Though the doctrine is generally efficient only after a time, when the student has been thoroughly tested, thou art easy for me to examine from thy depth of character and determination.’
iti vākyamarāḍasya vijñāya sa narādhipaḥ | babhūva paramaprītaḥ provācottarameva ca ||	The prince, having heard these words of Arāḍa, was filled with great pleasure and thus made reply:
viraktasyāpi yadidaṃ saumukhyaṃ bhavataḥ param | akṛtārtho 'pyanenāsmi kṛtārtha iva saṃprati ||	‘This extreme kindliness which thou showest to me, calmly passionless as thou art, makes me, imperfect as I am, seem even already to have attained perfection.
didṛkṣuriva hi jyotiryiyāsuriva daiśikam | tvaddarśanādahaṃ manye titīrṣuriva ca plavam ||	‘I feel at the sight of thee like one longing to see who finds a light, — like one wishing to journey, a guide, — or like one wishing to cross, a boat.
tasmādarhasi tadvaktuṃ vaktavyaṃ yadi manyase | jarāmaraṇarogebhyo yathāyaṃ parimucyate ||	‘Wilt thou therefore deign to tell me that secret, if thou thinkest it should be told, whereby thy servant may be delivered from old age, death, and disease.’
ityarāḍaḥ kumārasya māhātmyādeva coditaḥ | saṃkṣiptaṃ kathayāṃ cakre svasya śāstrasya niścayam ||	Arāḍa, thus impelled by the noble nature of the prince, declared in a concise form the tenets of his doctrine:
śrūyatāmayamasmākaṃ siddhāṃtaḥ śṛṇvatāṃ vara | yathā bhavati saṃsāro yathā vai parivartate ||	‘O best of hearers, hear this our firmly-settled theory, how our mortal existence arises and how it revolves.
prakṛtiśca vikāraśca janma mṛtyurjaraiva ca | tattāvatsattvamityuktaṃ sthirasattva parehi naḥ ||	“The evolvent” and “the evolute,” birth, old age, and death, — know that this has been called the reality by us; do thou receive our words, O thou who art stedfast in thy nature.
tatra tu prakṛtirnāma viddhi prakṛtikovida | paṃca bhūtānyahaṃkāraṃ buddhimavyaktameva ca ||	‘But know, O thou who art deep in the search into the nature of things, that the five elements,   egoism, intellect, and “the unmanifested” are the “evolvents;”
vikāra iti buddhiṃ tu viṣayāniṃdriyāṇi ca | pāṇipādaṃ ca vādaṃ ca pāyūpasthaṃ tathā manaḥ ||	‘But know that the “evolutes” consist of intellect, external objects,  the senses, and the hands, feet, voice, anus, and generative organ, and also the mind.
asya kṣetrasya vijñānāt kṣetrajña iti saṃjñi ca | kṣetrajña iti cātmānaṃ kathayaṃtyātmaciṃtakāḥ ||	‘There is also a something which bears the name kṣetrajña, from its knowledge of this “field” (kṣetra or the body); and those who investigate the soul call the soul kṣetrajña.
saśiṣyaḥ kapilaśceha pratibuddha iti smṛtiḥ | saputraḥ pratibuddhaśca prajāpatirihocyate ||	‘Kapila with his disciple became the illuminated, — such is the tradition; and he, as the illuminated, with his son is now called here Prajāpati.
jāyate jīryate caiva budhyate mriyate ca yat | tadvyaktamiti vijñeyamavyaktaṃ tu viparyayāt ||	‘That which is born and grows old and is bound and dies, — is to be known as “the manifested,” and “the unmanifested” is to be distinguished by its contrariety.
ajñānaṃ karma tṛṣṇā ca jñeyāḥ saṃsārahetavaḥ | sthito 'smiṃstritaye yastu tatsattvaṃ nābhivartate ||	‘Ignorance, the merit or demerit of former actions, and desire are to be known as the causes of mundane existence; he who abides in the midst of this triad does not attain to the truth of things, —
vipratyayādahaṃkārātsaṃdehādabhisaṃplavāt | aviśeṣānupāyābhyāṃ saṃgādabhyavapātataḥ ||	‘From mistake,  egoism, confusion, fluctuation, indiscrimination, false means, inordinate attachment, and gravitation.
tatra vipratyayo nāma viparītaṃ pravartate | anyathā kurute kāryaṃ maṃtavyaṃ manyate 'nyathā ||	‘Now “mistake” acts in a contrary manner, it does wrongly what it should do, and what it should think it thinks wrongly.
bravīmyahamahaṃ vedmi gacchāmyahamahaṃ sthitaḥ | itīhaivamahaṃkārastvanahaṃkāra vartate ||	“I say,” “I know,” “I go,” “I am firmly fixed,” it is thus that “egoism” shows itself here, O thou who art free from all egoism.
yastu bhāvena saṃdigdhānekībhāvena paśyati | mṛtpiṃḍavadasaṃdeha saṃdehaḥ sa ihocyate ||	‘That state of mind is called “confusion,” O thou who art all unconfused, which views under one nature, massed like a lump of clay, objects that thus become confused in their nature.
ya evāhaṃ sa evedaṃ mano buddhiśca karma ca | yaścaivaṃ sa gaṇaḥ so 'hamiti yaḥ so 'bhisaṃplavaḥ ||	‘That state of mind which says that this mind, intellect, and these actions are the same as “I,” and that which says that all this aggregate is the same as “I,” — is called “fluctuation.”
aviśeṣaṃ viśeṣajña pratibuddhāprabuddhayoḥ | prakṛtīnāṃ ca yo veda so 'viśeṣa iti smṛtaḥ ||	‘That state of mind is called “indiscrimination,” O thou who art discriminating, which thinks there is no difference between the illuminated and the unwise, and between the different evolvents.
namaskāravaṣaṭkārau prokṣaṇābhyukṣaṇādayaḥ | anupāya iti prājñairupāyajña praveditaḥ ||	‘Uttering “namas” and “vaṣaṭ,” sprinkling water upon sacrifices, and with or without the recital of Vedic hymns, and such like rites, — these are declared by the wise to be “false means,” O thou who art well skilled in true means.
sajjate yena durmedhā manovākkarmabuddhibhiḥ | viṣayeṣvanabhiṣvaṃga so 'bhiṣvaṃga iti smṛtaḥ ||	‘That is called “inordinate attachment,” by which the fool is entangled in external objects through his mind, speech, actions, and thoughts, O thou who hast shaken thyself free from all attachments.
mamedamahamasyeti yadduḥkhamabhimanyate | vijñeyo 'bhyavapātaḥ sa saṃsāre yena pātyate ||	‘The misery which a man imagines by the ideas “This is mine,” “I am connected with this,” is to be recognised as “gravitation,” — by this a man is borne downwards into new births.
ityavidyā hi vidvāṃsaḥ paṃcaparvā samīhate | tamo mohaṃ mahāmohaṃ tāmisradvayameva ca ||	‘Thus Ignorance, O ye wise, being fivefold in its character, energises towards torpor, delusion, the great delusion, and the two kinds of darkness.
tatrālasyaṃ tamo viddhi mohaṃ mṛtyuṃ ca janma ca | mahāmohastvasaṃmoha kāma ityavagamyatām ||	‘Know, that among these indolence is “torpor,” death and birth are “delusion,” and be it clearly understood, O undeluded one, that desire is the “great delusion.”
yasmādatra ca bhūtāni pramuhyaṃti mahāṃtyapi | tasmādeṣa mahābāho mahāmoha iti smṛtaḥ ||	‘Since by it even the higher beings are deluded, therefore, O hero, is this called the “great delusion.”
tāmisramiti cākrodha krodhamevādhikurvate | viṣādaṃ cāṃdhatāmisramaviṣāda pracakṣate ||	‘They define anger, O thou angerless one, as “darkness;” and despondency, O undesponding, they pronounce to be the “blind darkness.”
anayāvidyayā bālaḥ saṃyuktaḥ paṃcaparvayā | saṃsāre duḥkhabhūyiṣṭhe janmasvabhiniṣicyate ||	‘The child, entangled in this fivefold ignorance, is effused in his different births in a world abounding with misery.
draṣṭā śrotā ca maṃtā ca kāryaṃ karaṇameva ca | ahamityevamāgamya saṃsāre parivartate ||	‘He wanders about in the world of embodied existence, thinking that I am the seer, and the hearer, and the thinker, — the effect and the cause.
ityebhirhetubhirdhīman tamaḥsrotaḥ pravartate | hetvabhāve phalābhāva iti vijñātumarhasi ||	‘Through these causes,  O wise prince, the stream of “torpor” is set in motion; be pleased to consider that in the absence of the cause there is the absence of the effect.
tatra samyagmatirvidyānmokṣakāma catuṣṭayam | pratibuddhāprabuddhau ca vyaktamavyaktameva ca ||	‘Let the wise man who has right views know these four things, O thou who desirest liberation, — the illuminated and the unilluminated, the manifested and the unmanifested.
yathāvadetadvijñāya kṣetrajño hi catuṣṭayam | ārjavaṃ javatāṃ hitvā prāpnoti padamakṣaram ||	‘The soul, having once learned to distinguish these four properly, having abandoned all (ideas of) straightness or quickness,  attains to the immortal sphere.
ityarthaṃ brāhmaṇā loke paramabrahmavādinaḥ | brahmacaryaṃ caraṃtīha brāhmaṇān vāsayaṃti ca ||	‘For this reason the Brāhmans in the world, discoursing on the supreme Brahman, practise here a rigorous course of sacred study and let other Brāhmans live with them to follow it also.’
iti vākyamidaṃ śrutvā munestasya nṛpātmajaḥ | abhyupāyaṃ ca papraccha padameva ca naiṣṭhikam ||	The prince, having heard this discourse from the seer, asked concerning the means and the final state.
brahmacaryamidaṃ caryaṃ yathā yāvacca yatra ca | dharmasyāsya ca paryaṃtaṃ bhavān vyākhyātumarhati ||	‘Wilt thou please to explain to me how, how far, and where this life of sacred study is to be led, and the limit of this course of life?’
ityarāḍo yathāśāstraṃ vispaṣṭārthaṃ samāsataḥ | tamevānyena kalpena dharmamasmai vyabhāṣata ||	Then Arāḍa, according to his doctrine, declared to him in another way that course of life clearly and succinctly.
ayamādau gṛhānmuktvā bhaikṣākaṃ liṃgamāśritaḥ | samudācāravistīrṇaṃ śīlamādāya vartate ||	‘The devotee, in the beginning, having left his house, and assumed the signs of the mendicant, goes on, following a rule of conduct which extends to the whole life.
saṃtoṣaṃ paramāsthāya yena tena yatastataḥ | viviktaṃ sevate vāsaṃ nirdvaṃdvaḥ śāstravitkṛtī ||	‘Cultivating absolute content with any alms from any person, he carries out his lonely life, indifferent to all feelings, meditating on the holy books, and satisfied in himself.
tato rāgādbhayaṃ dṛṣṭvā vairāgyācca paraṃ śivam | nigṛhṇanniṃdriyagrāmaṃ yatate manasaḥ śrame ||	‘Then having seen how fear arises from passion and the highest happiness from the absence of passion, he strives, by restraining all the senses, to attain to tranquillity of mind.
atho viviktaṃ kāmebhyo vyāpādādibhya eva ca | vivekajamavāpnoti pūrvadhyānaṃ vitarkavat ||	‘Then he reaches the first stage of contemplation, which is separated from desires, evil intentions and the like, and arises from discrimination and which involves reasoning.
tacca dhyānaṃ sukhaṃ prāpya tattadeva vitarkayan | apūrvasukhalābhena hriyate bāliśo janaḥ ||	‘And having obtained this ecstatic contemplation, and reasoning on various objects, the childish mind is carried away by the possession of the new unknown ecstasy.
śamenaivaṃvidhenāyaṃ kāmadveṣavigarhiṇā | brahmalokamavāpnoti paritoṣeṇa vaṃcitaḥ ||	‘With a tranquillity of this kind, which disdains desire or dislike, he reaches the world of Brahman, deceived by the delight.
jñātvā vidvān vitarkāṃstu manaḥsaṃkṣobhakārakān | tadviyuktamavāpnoti dhyānaṃ prītisukhānvitam ||	‘But the wise man, knowing that these reasonings bewilder the mind, reaches a (second) stage of contemplation separate from this, which has its own pleasure and ecstasy.
hriyamāṇastayā prītyā yo viśeṣaṃ na paśyati | sthānaṃ bhāsvaramāpnoti deveṣvābhāsureṣvapi ||	‘And he who, carried away by this pleasure, sees no further distinction, obtains a dwelling full of light, even amongst the Ābhāsura deities.
yastu prītisukhāttasmādvivecayati mānasam | tṛtīyaṃ labhate dhyānaṃ sukhaṃ prītivivarjitam ||	‘But he who separates his mind from this pleasure and ecstasy, reaches the third stage of contemplation ecstatic but without pleasure.
tatra kecidvyavasyaṃti mokṣa ityapi māninaḥ | sukhaduḥkhaparityāgādavyāpārācca cetasaḥ ||	‘Upon this stage some teachers make their stand, thinking that it is indeed liberation, since pleasure and pain have been left behind and there is no exercise of the intellect.
yastu tasminsukhe magno na viśeṣāya yatnavān | śubhakṛtsnaiḥ sa sāmānyaṃ sukhaṃ prāpnoti daivataiḥ ||	‘But he who, immersed in this ecstasy, strives not for a further distinction, obtains an ecstasy in common with the Śubhakṛtsna deities.
tādṛśaṃ sukhamāsādya yo na rajyannupekṣate | caturthaṃ dhyānamāpnoti sukhaduḥkhavivarjitam ||	‘But he who, having attained such a bliss desires it not but despises it, obtains the fourth stage of contemplation which is separate from all pleasure or pain.
asya dhyānasya tu phalaṃ samaṃ devairvṛhatphalaiḥ | kathayaṃti vṛhatphalaṃ vṛhatprajñāparīkṣakāḥ ||	‘The fruit of this contemplation which is on an equality with the Vṛhatphala deities, those who investigate the great wisdom call the Vṛhatphala.
samādhervyutthitastasmāddṛṣṭvā doṣāṃścharīriṇām | jñānamārohati prājñaḥ śarīravinivṛttaye ||	‘But rising beyond this contemplation, having seen the imperfections of all embodied souls, the wise man climbs to a yet higher wisdom in order to abolish all body.
tatastaddhyānamutsṛjya viśeṣe kṛtaniścayaḥ | kāmebhya iva satprājño rūpādapi virajyate ||	‘Then, having abandoned this contemplation, being resolved to find a further distinction, he becomes as disgusted with form itself as he who knows the real is with pleasures.
śarīre khāni yānyasya tānyādau parikalpayan | ghaneṣvapi tato dravyeṣvākāśamadhimucyate ||	‘First he makes use of all the apertures of his body; and next he exerts his will to experience a feeling of void space even in the solid parts.
ākāśasamamātmānaṃ saṃkṣipya tvaparo budhaḥ | tadaivānaṃtataḥ paśyan viśeṣamadhigacchati ||	‘But another wise man, having contracted his soul which is by nature extended everywhere like the ether,  — as he gazes ever further on, detects a yet higher distinction.
adhyātmakuśaleṣvanyo nivartyātmānamātmanā | kiṃcinnāstīti saṃpaśyannākiṃcanya iti smṛtaḥ ||	‘Another one of those who are profoundly versed in the supreme Self, having abolished himself by himself, sees that nothing exists and is called a Nihilist.
tato muṃjādiṣīkeva śakuniḥ paṃjarādiva | kṣetrajño niḥsṛto dehānmukta ityabhidhīyate ||	‘Then like the Muñja-reed’s stalk  from its sheath or the bird from its cage, the soul, escaped from the body, is declared to be “liberated.”
etattatparamaṃ brahma nirliṃgaṃ dhruvamakṣaram | yanmokṣa iti tattvajñāḥ kathayaṃti manīṣiṇaḥ ||	‘This is that supreme Brahman, constant, eternal, and without distinctive signs; which the wise who know reality declare to be liberation.
ityupāyaśca mokṣaśca mayā saṃdarśitastava | yadi jñātaṃ yadi ruci yathāvatpratipadyatām ||	‘Thus have I shown to thee the means and liberation; if thou hast understood and approved it, then act accordingly.
jaigīṣavyo 'tha janako vṛddhaścaiva parāśaraḥ | imaṃ paṃthānamāsādya muktā hyanye ca mokṣiṇaḥ ||	‘Jaigīṣavya  and Janaka, and the aged Parāsara, by following this path, were liberated, and so were others who sought liberation.’
iti tasya sa tadvākyaṃ gṛhītvā na vicārya ca | pūrvahetubalaprāptaḥ pratyuttaramuvāca saḥ ||	The prince having not accepted his words but having pondered them, filled with the force of his former arguments, thus made answer:
śrutaṃ jñānamidaṃ sūkṣmaṃ parataḥ parataḥ śivam | kṣetreṣvasyāparityāgādavaimyetadanaiṣṭhikam ||	‘I have heard this thy doctrine, subtil and pre-eminently auspicious, but I hold that it cannot be final, because it does not teach us how to abandon this soul itself in the various bodies.
vikāraprakṛtibhyo hi kṣetrajñaṃ muktamapyaham | manye prasavadharmāṇaṃ vījadharmāṇameva ca ||	‘For I consider that the embodied soul, though freed from the evolutes and the evolvents, is still subject to the condition of birth and has the condition of a seed.
viśuddho yadyapi hyātmā nirmukta iti kalpyate | atyaṃtastatparityāgaḥ satyātmani na vidyate ||	‘Even though the pure soul is declared to be “liberated,” yet as long as the soul remains there can be no absolute abandonment of it.
hitvā hitvā trayamidaṃ viśeṣastūpalabhyate | ātmanastu sthitiryatra tatra sūkṣmamidaṃ trayam ||	‘If we abandon successively all this triad, yet “distinction” is still perceived; as long as the soul itself continues, there this triad continues in a subtil form.
sūkṣmatvāccaiva doṣāṇāmavyāpārācca cetasaḥ | dīrghatvādāyuṣaścaiva mokṣastu parikalpyate ||	‘It is held (by some) that this is liberation, because the “imperfections” are so attenuated, and the thinking power is inactive, and the term of existence is so prolonged;
ahaṃkāraparityāgo yaścaiṣa parikalpyate | satyātmani parityāgo nāhaṃkārasya vidyate ||	‘But as for this supposed abandonment of the principle of egoism, — as long as the soul continues, there is no real abandonment of egoism.
saṃkhyādibhiramuktaśca nirguṇo na bhavatyayam | tasmādasati nairguṇye nāsya mokṣo 'bhidhīyate ||	‘The soul does not become free from qualities as long as it is not released from number and the rest; therefore, as long as there is no freedom from qualities, there is no liberation declared for it.
guṇino hi guṇānāṃ ca vyatireko na vidyate | rūpoṣṇābhyāṃ virahito na hyagnirupalabhyate ||	‘There is no real separation of the qualities and their subject; for fire cannot be conceived, apart from its form and heat.
prāgdehānna bhaveddehī prāgguṇebhyastathā guṇī | kasmādādau vimuktaḥ sañśarīrī badhyate punaḥ ||	‘Before the body there will be nothing embodied, so before the qualities there will be no subject; how, if it was originally free, could the soul ever become bound?
kṣetrajño viśarīraśca jño vā syādajña eva vā | yadi jño jñeyamasyāsti jñeye sati na mucyate ||	‘The body-knower (the soul) which is unembodied, must be either knowing or unknowing; if it is knowing, there must be some object to be known, and if there is this object, it is not liberated.
athājña iti siddho vaḥ kalpitena kimātmanā | vināpi hyātmanājñānaṃ prasiddhaṃ kāṣṭhakuḍyavat ||	‘Or if the soul is declared to be unknowing, then of what use to you is this imagined soul? Even without such a soul, the existence of the absence of knowledge is notorious as, for instance, in a log of wood or a wall.
parataḥ paratastyāgo yasmāttu guṇavān smṛtaḥ | tasmātsarvaparityāgānmanye kṛtsnāṃ kṛtārthatām ||	‘And since each successive abandonment is held to be still accompanied by qualities, I maintain that the absolute attainment of our end can only be found in the abandonment of everything.’
iti dharmamarāḍasya viditvā na tutoṣa saḥ | akṛtsnamiti vijñāya tataḥ pratijagāma ha ||	Thus did he remain unsatisfied after he had heard the doctrine of Arāḍa; then having decided it to be incomplete, he turned away.
viśeṣamatha śuśrūṣurudrakasyāśramaṃ yayau | ātmagrāhācca tasyāpi jagṛhe na sa darśanam ||	Seeking to know the true distinction, he went to the hermitage of Udraka,  but he gained no clear understanding from his treatment of the soul.
saṃjñāsaṃjñitvayordoṣaṃ jñātvā hi munirudrakaḥ | ākiṃcinyātparaṃ lebhe saṃjñāsaṃjñātmikāṃ gatim ||	For the sage Udraka, having learned the inherent imperfections of the name and the thing named, took refuge in a theory beyond Nihilism, which maintained a name and a non-name.
yasmāccālaṃbane sūkṣme saṃjñāsaṃjñe tataḥ param | nāsaṃjñī naiva saṃjñīti tasmāttatra gataspṛhaḥ ||	And since even a name and a non-name were substrata, however subtil, he went even further still and found his restlessness set at rest in the idea that there is no named and no un-named;
yataśca buddhistatraiva sthitānyatrāpracāriṇī | sūkṣmāpādi tatastatra nāsaṃjñitvaṃ na saṃjñitā ||	And because the intellect rested there, not proceeding any further, — it became very subtil, and there was no such thing as un-named nor as named.
yasmācca tamapi prāpya punarāvartate jagat | bodhisattvaḥ paraṃ prepsustasmādudrakamatyajat ||	But because, even when it has reached this goal it yet returns again to the world, therefore the Bodhisattva, seeking something beyond, left Udraka.
tato hitvāśramaṃ tasya śreyo 'rthī kṛtaniścayaḥ | bheje gayasya rājarṣernagarīsaṃjñamāśramam ||	Having quitted his hermitage, fully resolved in his purpose, and seeking final bliss, he next visited the hermitage, called a city, of the royal sage Gaya.
atha nairaṃjanātīre śucau śuciparākramaḥ | cakāra vāsamekāṃtavihārābhivratī muniḥ ||	Then on the pure bank of the Nairañjanā the saint whose every effort was pure fixed his dwelling, bent as he was on a lonely habitation.
tatpūrvaṃ paṃceṃdriyavaśoddhatān | tapaḥ vratino bhikṣūn paṃca niraikṣata ||	Then he saw five mendicants who had come there before him; they had taken vows on themselves and practised austerities, vaunting themselves of control of the five senses.
paṃcopatasthurdṛṣṭvātra bhikṣavastaṃ mumukṣavaḥ | puṇyārjitadhanārogyamiṃdriyārthā iveśvaram ||	Five mendicants, desiring liberation, came up to him when they beheld him there, just as the objects of the senses come up to a percipient who has gained wealth and health by his previous merit.
saṃpūjyamānastaiḥ prahvairvinayānatamūrtibhiḥ | tadvaṃśasthāyibhiḥ śiṣyairlolairmana iveṃdriyaiḥ ||	Being honoured by these disciples who were dwelling in that family, as they bowed reverently with their bodies bent low in humility, as the mind is honoured by the restless senses,
mṛtyujanmāṃtakaraṇe syādupāyo 'yamityatha | duṣkarāṇi samārebhe tapāṃsyanaśanena saḥ ||	And thinking, ‘this may be the means of abolishing birth and death,’ he at once commenced a series of difficult austerities by fasting.
upavāsavidhīn nekān kurvan naradurācarān | varṣāṇi ṣaṭkarmaprepsurakarotkārśyamātmanaḥ ||	For six years, vainly trying to attain merit,  he practised self-mortification, performing many rules of abstinence, hard for a man to carry out.
annakāleṣu caikaikaiḥ sakolatilataṃḍulaiḥ | apārapārasaṃsārapāraṃ prepsurapārayat ||	At the hours for eating, he, longing to cross the world whose farther shore is so difficult to reach, broke his vow with single jujube fruits, sesame seeds, and rice.
dehādapacayastena tapasā tasya yaḥ kṛtaḥ | sa evopacayo bhūyastejasāsya kṛto 'bhavat ||	But the emaciation which was produced in his body by that asceticism, became positive fatness through the splendour which invested him.
kṛśo 'pyakṛśakīrtiśrīrhlādaṃ cakre 'nyacakṣuṣam | kumudānāmiva śaracchuklapakṣādicaṃdramāḥ ||	Though thin, yet with his glory and his beauty unimpaired, he caused gladness to other eyes, as the autumnal moon in the beginning of her bright fortnight gladdens the lotuses.
tvagasthiśeṣo niḥśeṣairmedaḥpiśitaśoṇitaiḥ | kṣīṇo 'pyakṣīṇagāṃbhīryaḥ samudra iva sa vyabhāt ||	Having only skin and bone remaining, with his fat, flesh and blood entirely wasted, yet, though diminished, he still shone with undiminished grandeur like the ocean.
atha kaṣṭatapaḥspaṣṭavyarthakliṣṭatanurmuniḥ | bhavabhīrurimāṃ cakre buddhiṃ buddhatvakāṃkṣayā ||	Then the seer, having his body evidently emaciated to no purpose in a cruel self-mortification; — dreading continued existence, thus reflected in his longing to become a Buddha:
nāyaṃ dharmo virāgāya na bodhāya na muktaye | jaṃbumūle mayā prāpto yastadā sa vidhirdhruvaḥ ||	‘This is not the way to passionlessness, nor to perfect knowledge, nor to liberation; that was certainly the true way which I found at the root of the Jambu  tree.
na cāsau durbalenāptuṃ śakyamityāgatādaraḥ | śarīrabalavṛddhyarthamidaṃ bhūyo 'nvaciṃtayat ||	‘But that cannot be attained by one who has lost his strength’, — so resuming his care for his body, he next pondered thus, how best to increase his bodily vigour:
kṣutpipāsāśramaklāṃtaḥ śramādasvasthamānasaḥ | prāpnuyānmanasāvāpyaṃ phalaṃ kathamanirvṛtaḥ ||	‘Wearied with hunger, thirst, and fatigue, with his mind no longer self-possessed through fatigue, how should one who is not absolutely calm reach the end which is to be attained by his mind?
nirvṛtiḥ prāpyate samyaksatateṃdriyatarpaṇāt | saṃtarpiteṃdriyatayā manaḥsvāsthyamavāpyate ||	‘True calm is properly obtained by the constant satisfaction of the senses; the mind’s self-possession is only obtained by the senses being perfectly satisfied.
svasthaprasannamanasaḥ samādhirupapadyate | samādhiyuktacittasya dhyānayogaḥ pravartate ||	‘True meditation is produced in him whose mind is self-possessed and at rest, — to him whose thoughts are engaged in meditation the exercise of perfect contemplation begins at once.
dhyānapravartanāddharmāḥ prāpyaṃte yairavāpyate | durlabhaṃ śāṃtamajaraṃ paraṃ tadamṛtaṃ padam ||	‘By contemplation are obtained those conditions  through which is eventually gained that supreme calm, undecaying, immortal state, which is so hard to be reached.’
tasmādāhāramūlo 'yamupāya itiniścayaḥ | asūrikaraṇe dhīraḥ kṛtvāmitamatirmatim ||	Having thus resolved, ‘this means is based upon eating food,’ the wise seer of unbounded wisdom, having made up his mind to accept the continuance of life,
snāto nairaṃjanātīrāduttatāra śanaiḥ kṛśaḥ | bhaktyāvanataśākhāgrairdattahastastaṭadrumaiḥ ||	And having bathed, thin as he was, slowly came up the bank of the Nairañjanā, supported as by a hand by the trees on the shore, which bent down the ends of their branches in adoration.
atha gopādhipasutā daivatairabhicoditā | udbhūtahṛdayānaṃdā tatra naṃdabalāgamat ||	Now at that time Nandabalā, the daughter of the leader of the herdsmen, impelled by the gods, with a sudden joy risen in her heart, had just come near,
sitaśaṃkhojjvalabhujā nīlakaṃbalavāsinī | sapheṇamālānīlāṃburyamuneva saridvarā ||	Her arm gay with a white shell, and wearing a dark blue woollen cloth, like the river Yamunā, with its dark blue water and its wreath of foam.
sā śraddhāvardhitaprītirvikasallocanotpalā | śirasā praṇipatyainaṃ grāhayāmāsa pāyasam ||	She, having her joy increased by her faith, with her lotus-like eyes opened wide, bowed down before him and persuaded him to take some milk.
kṛtvā tadupabhogena prāptajanmaphalāṃ sa tām | bodhiprāptau samartho 'bhūtsaṃtarpitaṣaḍiṃdriyaḥ ||	By partaking that food having made her obtain the full reward of her birth, he himself became capable of gaining the highest knowledge, all his six senses being now satisfied,
paryāptāpyānamūrtaśca sārdhaṃ suyaśasā muniḥ | kāṃtidhairyaikabhāraikaḥ śaśāṃkārṇavavalbabhau ||	The seer, having his body now fully robust, together with his glorious fame, one beauty and one majesty being equally spread in both, shone like the ocean and the moon.
āvṛtta iti vijñāya taṃ jahuḥ paṃcabhikṣavaḥ | manīṣiṇamivātmānaṃ nirmuktaṃ paṃcadhātavaḥ ||	Thinking that he had returned to the world the five mendicants left him, as the five elements leave the wise soul when it is liberated.
vyavasāyadvitīyo 'tha śādvalāstīrṇabhūtalam | so 'śvatthamūlaṃ prayayau bodhāya kṛtaniścayaḥ ||	Accompanied only by his own resolve, having fixed his mind on the attainment of perfect knowledge, he went to the root of an Aśvattha tree,  where the surface of the ground was covered with young grass.
tatastadānīṃ gajarājavikramaḥ padasvanenānupamena bodhitaḥ | mahāmunerāgatabodhiniścayo jagāda kālo bhujagottamaḥ stutim ||	Then Kāla,  the best of serpents, whose majesty was like the lord of elephants, having been awakened by the unparalleled sound of his feet, uttered this praise of the great sage, being sure that he was on the point of attaining perfect knowledge:
yathā mune tvaccaraṇāvapīḍitā muhurmuhurniṣṭanatīva medinī | yathā ca te rājati sūryavatprabhā dhruvaṃ tvamiṣṭaṃ phalamadya bhokṣyase ||	‘Inasmuch as the earth, pressed down by thy feet, O sage, resounds repeatedly, and inasmuch as thy splendour shines forth like the sun, thou shalt assuredly to-day enjoy the desired fruit.
yathā bhramaṃtyo divi vāyapaṃktayaḥ pradakṣiṇaṃ tvāṃ kamalākṣa kurvate | yathā ca saumyā divi vāṃti vāyavastvamadya buddho niyataṃ bhaviṣyasi ||	‘Inasmuch as lines of birds fluttering in the sky offer thee reverential salutation, O lotus-eyed one, and inasmuch as gentle breezes blow in the sky, thou shalt certainly to-day become the Buddha.’

anena tava bhāvena bāṃdhavāyāsadāyinā | bhartaḥ sīdati me ceto nadīpaṃka iva dvipaḥ ||	‘At this state of mind of thine, causing affliction to thy kindred, my mind, O my lord, sinks down like an elephant in the mud of a river.
kasya notpādayedvāṣpaṃ niścayaste 'yamīdṛśaḥ | ayomaye 'pi hṛdaye kiṃ punaḥ snehaviklave ||	‘To whom would not such a determination as this of thine cause tears, even if his heart were of iron, — how much more if it were throbbing with love?
vimānaśayanārhaṃ hi saukumāryamidaṃ kva ca | kharadarbhāṃkuravatī tapovanamahī kva ca ||	‘Where  is this delicacy of limb, fit to lie only in a palace, — and where is the ground of the ascetic forest, covered with the shoots of rough kusa grass?
śrutvā tu vyavasāyaṃ te yadaśvo 'yaṃ mayā hṛtaḥ | balātkāreṇa tannātha daivenaivāsmi kāritaḥ ||	‘When, on hearing thy resolve, I first brought thee this horse, — it was fate only, O my lord, which made me do it, mastering my will.
kathaṃ hyātmavaśo jānan vyavasāyamimaṃ tava | upānayeyaṃ turagaṃ śokaṃ kapilavastunaḥ ||	‘But how could I, O king, by mine own will, knowing this thy decision, — carry back the horse to the sorrow of Kapilavastu?
tannārhasi mahābāho vihātuṃ putralālasam | snigdhaṃ vṛddhaṃ ca rājānaṃ saddharmamiva nāstikaḥ ||	‘Surely thou wilt not abandon, O hero, that fond old king, so devoted to his son, as a heretic might the true religion?

iti śokābhibhūtasya śrutvā chaṃdasya bhāṣitam | svasthaḥ paramayā dhṛtyā jagāda vadatāṃ varaḥ ||	Having heard these words of Chaṃda overcome with sorrow, — self-possessed with the utmost firmness the best of speakers answered:
madviyogaṃ prati cchaṃda saṃtāpastyajyatāmayam | nānābhāvo hi niyataṃ pṛthagjātiṣu dehiṣu ||	‘Abandon this distress, Chaṃda, regarding thy separation from me, — change is inevitable in corporeal beings who are subject to different births.
svajanaṃ yadyapi snehānna tyajeyaṃ mumukṣayā | mṛtyuranyonyamavaśānasmān saṃtyājayiṣyati ||	‘Even if I through affection were not to abandon my kindred in my desire for liberation, death would still make us helplessly abandon one another.

vāsavṛkṣe samāgamya vigacchaṃti yathāṃḍajāḥ | niyataṃ viprayogāṃtastathā bhūtasamāgamaḥ ||	‘As birds go to their roosting-tree and then depart, so the meeting of beings inevitably ends in separation.
sametya ca yathā bhūyo vyapayāṃti valāhakāḥ | saṃyogo viprayogaśca tathā me prāṇināṃ mataḥ ||	‘As clouds, having come together, depart asunder again, such I consider the meeting and parting of living things.
yasmādyāti ca loko 'yaṃ vipralabhya parasparam | mamatvaṃ na kṣamaṃ tasmātsvapnabhūte samāgame ||	‘And since this world goes away, each one of us deceiving the other, — it is not right to think anything thine own in a time of union which is a dream.
sahajena viyujyaṃte parṇarāgeṇa pādapāḥ | anyenānyasya viśleṣaḥ kiṃ punarna bhaviṣyati ||	‘Since the trees are parted from the innate colour of their leaves, why should there not still more be the parting of two things which are alien to each other?
tadevaṃ sati saṃtāpaṃ mā kārṣīḥ saumya gamyatām | laṃbate yadi tu sneho gatvāpi punarāvraja ||	‘Therefore, since it is so, grieve not, my good friend, but go; or if thy love lingers, then go and afterwards return.

jālinā svastikāṃkena vakramadhyena pāṇinā | āmamarśa kumārastaṃ babhāṣe ca vayasyavat ||	With his hand whose fingers were united with a membrane and which was marked with the auspicious svastika, and with its middle part curved,  the prince stroked him and addressed him like a friend:
muṃca kaṃthaka mā vāṣpaṃ darśiteyaṃ sadaśvatā | mṛṣyatāṃ saphalaḥ śīghraṃ śramaste 'yaṃ bhaviṣyati ||	‘Shed not tears, Kaṃthaka, this thy perfect equine nature has been proved, — bear with it, this thy labour will soon have its fruit.’
maṇitsaruṃ chaṃdakahastasaṃsthaṃ tataḥ sa dhīro niśitaṃ gṛhītvā | kośādasiṃ kāṃcanabhakticitraṃ vilādivāśīviṣamudbabarha ||	Then seizing the sharp jewelled sword which was in Chaṃdaka’s hand, he resolutely drew out from the sheath the blade decked with golden ornaments, like a serpent from its hole.
niṣkāsya taṃ cotpalapattranīlaṃ ciccheda citraṃ mukuṭaṃ sakeśam | vikīryamāṇāṃśukamaṃtarīkṣe cikṣepa cainaṃ sarasīva haṃsam ||	Having drawn it forth, dark blue like a blue lotus petal, he cut his decorated tiara and his hair, and he tossed it with its scattered muslin into the air as a grey goose into a lake.

tato mṛgavyādhavapurdivaukā bhāvaṃ viditvāsya viśuddhabhāvaḥ | kāṣāyavastro 'bhiyayau samīpaṃ taṃ śākyarājaprabhavo 'bhyuvāca ||	Then a celestial being, wearing the form of a hunter, pure in heart, knowing his thoughts, approached near him in dark-red garments; and the son of the Śākya king thus addressed him:
śivaṃ ca kāṣāyamṛṣidhvajaste na yujyate hiṃsramidaṃ dhanuśca | tatsaumya yadyasti na saktiratra mahyaṃ prayacchedamidaṃ gṛhāṇa ||	‘Thy red garments are auspicious, the sign of a saint; but this destructive bow is not befitting; therefore, my good friend, if there is no strong preference in the matter, do thou give me that dress and take this of mine.’
vyādho 'bravītkāmada kāmamārādanena viśvāsya mṛgān nihatya | arthastu śakropama yadyanena haṃta pratīcchānaya śuklametat ||	The hunter replied, ‘It has given me my desire,  O giver of desires, as by this I have inspired animals with confidence and then killed them; but if thou hast need of it, O thou who art like Indra, accept it at once and give me the white dress.’
pareṇa harṣeṇa tataḥ sa vanyaṃ jagrāha vāso 'ṃśukamutsasarja | vyādhastu divyaṃ vapureva bibhrat tacchuklamādāya divaṃ jagāma ||	With extreme joy he then took that sylvan dress and gave away the linen one; and the hunter, assuming his heavenly form, having taken the white garment, went to heaven.

chaṃdaṃ tataḥ sāśrumukhaṃ visṛjya kāṣāyasaṃvidvṛtakīrtibhṛtsaḥ | yenāśramastena yayau mahātmā saṃdhyābhrasaṃvīta ivādrirājaḥ ||	Then the great-souled one, having dismissed the weeping Chaṃda, and wearing his fame veiled by the sign of the red garment, went towards the hermitage, like the king of mountains wrapped in an evening cloud.
tatastathā bhartari rājyaniḥspṛhe tapovanaṃ yāti vivarṇavāsasi | bhujau samutkṣipya tataḥ sa vājibhṛdbhṛśaṃ vicukrośa papāta ca kṣitau ||	While his master, thus regardless of his kingdom, was going to the ascetic-wood in mean garments, the groom, tossing up his arms, wailed bitterly and fell on the ground.
vilokya bhūyaśca ruroda sasvaraṃ hayaṃ bhujābhyāmupaguhya kaṃthakam | tato nirāśo vilapanmuhurmuhuryayau śarīreṇa puraṃ na cetasā ||	Having looked again he wept aloud, and embraced the horse Kaṃthaka with his arms; and then, hopeless and repeatedly lamenting, he went in body to the city, not in soul.
kvacitpradadhyau vilalāpa ca kvacit kvacitpracaskhāla papāta ca kvacit | ato vrajan bhaktivaśena duḥkhitaścacāra bahvīravaśaḥ pathi kriyāḥ ||	Sometimes he pondered, sometimes he lamented, sometimes he stumbled, and sometimes he fell; and so going along, wretched through his devoted attachment, he performed all kinds of actions in the road without conscious will.
tato visṛjyāśrumukhaṃ rudaṃtaṃ chaṃdaṃ vanacchaṃdatayā nirāsthaḥ | sarvārthasiddho vapuṣābhibhūya tamāśramaṃ siddhamiva prapede ||	Then having left the weeping tear-faced Chaṃda, — indifferent to all things in his longing for the forest, he by whom all objects are accomplished, overpowering the place by his beauty, entered that hermitage as if it were fully blessed.

viprāśca gatvā bahiridhmahetoḥ prāptāḥ samitpuṣpapavitrahastāḥ | tapaḥpradhānāḥ kṛtabuddhayo 'pi taṃ draṣṭumīyurna maṭhānabhīyuḥ ||	And the Brāhmans who had gone outside for the sake of fuel, having come with their hands full of fuel, flowers, and kusa grass, — pre-eminent as they were in penances, and proficients in wisdom, went to see him, and went not to their cells.
hṛṣṭāśca kekā mumucurmayūrā dṛṣṭvāṃbudaṃ nīlamivonnamaṃtam | śaṣpāṇi hitvābhimukhāśca tasthurmṛgāścalākṣā mṛgacāriṇaśca ||	Delighted the peacocks uttered their cries, as if they had seen a dark-blue cloud rising up; and leaving the young grass and coming forward, the deer with restless eyes and the ascetics who grazed like deer  stood still.

ityevamādi dvipadeṃdravatsaḥ śrutvā vacastasya tapodhanasya | adṛṣṭatattvo 'pi na saṃtutoṣa śanairidaṃ cātmagataṃ jagāda ||	The king’s son, having heard this speech of the ascetic, even though he saw no lofty truth in it,  was not content, but gently uttered these thoughts to himself:
duḥkhātmakaṃ naikavidhaṃ tapaśca svargapradhānaṃ tapasaḥ phalaṃ ca | lokāśca sarve pariṇāmavaṃtaḥ svalpe śramaḥ khalvayamāśramāṇām ||	‘The penance is full of pain and of many kinds, and the fruit of the penance is mainly heaven at its best, and all the worlds are subject to change; verily the labour of the hermitages is spent for but little gain.
śriyaṃ ca baṃdhūn viṣayāṃśca hitvā ye svargahetau niyamaṃ caraṃti | te viprayuktāḥ khalu gaṃtukāmā mahattaraṃ svaṃ vanameva bhūyaḥ ||	‘Those who abandoning wealth, kindred, and worldly objects, undertake vows for the sake of heaven, — they, when parted, only wish to go to a still greater wood of their own again.
kāyaklamairyaśca tapo 'bhidhānaiḥ pravṛttimākāṃkṣati kāmahetoḥ | saṃsāradoṣānaparīkṣamāṇo duḥkhena so 'nvicchati duḥkhameva ||	‘He who by all these bodily toils which are called penances, seeks a sphere of action for the sake of desire, — not examining the inherent evils of mundane existence, he only seeks pain by pain.
trāsaśca nityaṃ maraṇātprajānāṃ yatnena cecchaṃti punaḥ prasūtim | satyāṃ pravṛttau niyataśca mṛtyustatraiva magno yata eva bhītaḥ ||	‘There is ever to living creatures fear from death, and they with all their efforts seek to be born again; where there is action, there must inevitably be death, — he is always drowned therein, just because he is afraid.
ihārthameke praviśaṃti khedaṃ svargārthamanye śramamāpnuvaṃti | sukhārthamāśākṛpaṇo 'kṛtārthaḥ patatyanarthe khalu jīvalokaḥ ||	‘Some undergo misery for the sake of this world, others meet toil for the sake of heaven; all living beings, wretched through hope and always missing their aim, fall certainly for the sake of happiness into misery.
na khalvayaṃ garhita eva yatno yo hīnamutsṛjya viśeṣagāmī | prājñaiḥ samānena pariśrameṇa kāryaṃ tu tadyatra punarna kāryam ||	‘It is not the effort itself which I blame, — which flinging aside the base pursues a high path of its own; but the wise, by all this common toil, ought to attain that state in which nothing needs ever to be done again.
śarīrapīḍā tu yadīha dharmaḥ sukhaṃ śarīrasya bhavatyadharmaḥ | dharmeṇa cāpnoti sukhaṃ paratra tasmādadharmaṃ phalatīha dharmaḥ ||	‘If the mortification of the body here is religion, then the body’s happiness is only irreligion; but by religion a man obtains happiness in the next world, therefore religion here bears irreligion as its fruit.
yataḥ śarīraṃ manaso vaśena pravartate vāpi nivartate vā | yukto damaścetasa eva tasmāccittādṛte kāṣṭhasamaṃ śarīram ||	‘Since it is only by the mind’s authority that the body either acts or ceases to act, therefore to control the thought is alone befitting, — without the thought the body is like a log.
āhāraśuddhyā yadi puṇyamiṣṭaṃ tasmānmṛgāṇāmapi puṇyamasti | ye cāpi bāhyāḥ puruṣāḥ phalebhyo bhāgyāparādhena parāṅmukhatvāt ||	‘If merit is gained by purity of food, then there is merit also in the deer; and in those men also who live as outcasts from all enjoyments, through being estranged from them by the fault of their destiny.
duḥkhe 'bhisaṃdhistvatha puṇyahetuḥ sukhe 'pi kāryo nanu so 'bhisaṃdhiḥ | atha pramāṇaṃ na sukhe 'bhisaṃdhirduḥkhe pramāṇaṃ nanu nābhisaṃdhiḥ ||	‘If the deliberate choice of pain is a cause of merit, why should not that same choice be directed to pleasure? If you say that the choice of pleasure carries no authority, is not the choice of pain equally without authority?
tathaiva ye karmaviśuddhihetoḥ spṛśaṃtyapastīrthamiti pravṛttāḥ | tatrāpi toṣo hṛdi kevalo 'yaṃ na pāvayiṣyaṃti hi pāpamāpaḥ ||	‘So too those who for the sake of purifying their actions, earnestly sprinkle water on themselves, saying, “this is a sacred spot,” — even there this satisfaction resides only in the heart, — for waters will not cleanse away sin.
spṛṣṭaṃ hi yadyadguṇavadbhiraṃbhastattatpṛthivyāṃ yadi tīrthamiṣṭam | tasmādguṇāneva paraimi tīrthamāpastu niḥsaṃśayamāpa eva ||	‘The water which has been touched by the virtuous, — that is the spot, if you wish for a sacred spot on the earth; therefore I count as a place of pilgrimage only the virtues of a virtuous man’,  — water without doubt is only water.’
iti sma tattadbahuyuktiyuktaṃ jagāda cāstaṃ ca yayau vivasvān | tato havirdhūmavivarṇavṛkṣaṃ tapaḥpraśāṃtaṃ sa vanaṃ viveśa ||	Thus he uttered his discourse full of various arguments, and the sun went down into the west; then he entered the grove where penances had now ceased and whose trees were gray with the smoke of the (evening) oblations;
abhyuddhṛtaprajvalitāgnihotraṃ kṛtābhiṣekarṣijanāvakīrṇam | jāpyasvanākūjitadevakoṣṭhaṃ dharmasya karmāṃtamiva pravṛttam ||	Where the sacred fires had been duly transferred when kindled to other spots, — all crowded with the holy hermits who had performed their ablutions, and with the shrines of the gods murmuring with the muttered prayers, — it seemed all alive like the full service of religion in exercise.
kāścinniśāstatra niśākarābhaḥ parīkṣamāṇaśca tapāṃsyuvāsa | sarvaṃ parikṣepya tapaśca matvā tasmāttapaḥkṣetratalājjagāma ||	He spent several nights there, himself like the moon, examining their penances; and he departed from that penance-field, feeling that he had comprehended the whole nature of penance.
anvavrajannāśramiṇastatastaṃ tadrūpamāhātmyagatairmanobhiḥ | deśādanāryairabhibhūyamānānmahārṣayo dharmamivāpayāṃtam ||	The dwellers of the hermitage followed him with their minds fixed on the greatness of soul visible in his person, as if they were great seers beholding Religion herself, withdrawn from a land invaded by the base.
tato jaṭāvalkalacīrakhelāṃstapodhanāṃścaiva sa tāndadarśa | tapāṃsi caiṣāmanubudhyamānastasthau śive śrīmati mārgavṛkṣe ||	Then he looked on all those ascetics with their matted hair, bark garments, and rag-strips waving, and he stood considering their penances under an auspicious and noble tree by the way-side.
athopasṛtyāśramavāsinastaṃ manuṣyavaryaṃ parivārya tasthuḥ | vṛddhaśca teṣāṃ bahumānapūrvaṃ kalena sāmnā giramityuvāca ||	Then the hermits having approached stood surrounding the best of men; and an old man from among them thus addressed him respectfully in a gentle voice:
tvayyāgate pūrṇa ivāśramo 'bhūtsaṃpadyate śūnya iva prayāte | tasmādimaṃ nārhasi tāta hātuṃ jijīviṣordehamiveṣṭamāyuḥ ||	‘At thy coming the hermitage seems to have become full, it becomes as it were empty when thou art gone, — therefore, my son, thou wilt not surely desert it, as the loved life the body of one who wishes to live.
brahmarṣirājarṣisurarṣijuṣṭaḥ puṇyaḥ samīpe himavān hi śailaḥ | tapāṃsi tānyeva tapodhanānāṃ yatsaṃnikarṣādbahulībhavaṃti ||	‘In front stands the holy mountain Himavat, inhabited by Brahmarṣis, rājarṣis, and surarṣis; by whose mere presence the merit of these penances becomes multiplied to the ascetics.
tīrthāni puṇyānyabhitastathaiva sopānabhūtāni nabhastalasya | juṣṭāni dharmātmabhirātmavadbhirdevarṣibhiścaiva mahārṣibhiśca ||	‘Near us also are holy spots of pilgrimage, which become ladders to heaven; loved by divine sages and saints whose souls are intent on devotion and who keep their souls in perfect control.
itaśca bhūyaḥ kṣamamuttaraiva diksevituṃ dharmaviśeṣahetoḥ | na hi kṣamaṃ dakṣiṇato budhena padaṃ bhavedekamapi prayātum ||	‘From hence, again, the Northern quarter is especially to be fitly followed for the sake of preeminent merit; even one who was wise starting towards the south could not advance one single step.
tapovane 'sminnatha niṣkriyo vā saṃkīrṇadharmā patito 'śucirvā | dṛṣṭastvayā yena na te vivatsā tadbrūhi yāvadrucito 'stu vāsaḥ ||	‘Hast thou seen in this sacred grove one who neglects all ceremonies or who follows confused ceremonies or an outcast or one impure, that thou dost not desire to dwell here? Speak it out, and let the abode be welcomed.
ime hi vāṃchaṃti tapaḥsahāyaṃ taponidhānapratimaṃ bhavaṃtam | vāsastvayā hīṃdrasamena sārdhaṃ vṛhaspaterabhyudayāvahaḥ syāt ||	‘These hermits here desire thee as their companion in penance, thee who art like a storehouse of penance, — to dwell with thee who art like Indra would bring prosperity even to Vṛhaspati.’
ityevamukte sa tapasvimadhye tapasvimukhyena manīṣimukhyaḥ | bhavapraṇāśāya kṛtapratijñaḥ svaṃ bhāvamaṃtargatamācacakṣe ||	He, the chief of the wise, when thus addressed in the midst of the ascetics by their chief—having resolved in his mind to put an end to all existence — thus uttered his inward thought:
ṛjvātmanāṃ dharmabhṛtāṃ munīnāmiṣṭātithitvātsvajanopamānam | evaṃvidhairmāṃ prati bhāvajātaiḥ prītiḥ parātmā janitaśca mārgaḥ ||	‘The upright-souled saints, the upholders of religion, become the very ideal of our own kindred through their delight in showing hospitality; by all these kind feelings of thine towards me affection is produced in me and the path which regards the self as supreme  is revealed.
snigdhābhirābhirhṛdayaṃgamābhiḥ samāsataḥ snāta ivāsmi vāgbhiḥ | ratiśca me dharmanavagrahasya vispaṃditā saṃprati bhūya eva ||	‘I seem to be all at once bathed by these gentle heart-touching words of thine, and the joy now throbs in me once more which I felt when I first grasped the idea of dharma.
evaṃ pravṛttān bhavataḥ śaraṇyānatīva saṃdarśitapakṣapātān | yāsyāmi hitveti mamāpi duḥkhaṃ yathaiva baṃdhūṃstyajatastathaiva ||	‘There is sorrow to me when I reflect that I shall have to depart, leaving you who are thus engaged, you who are such a refuge and who have shown such excessive kindness to me, — just as there was when I had to leave my kindred behind.
svargāya yuṣmākamayaṃ tu dharmo mamābhilāṣastvapunarbhavāya | asmin vane yena na me vivatsā bhinnaḥ pravṛttyā hi nivṛttidharmaḥ ||	‘But this devotion of yours is for the sake of heaven, — while my desire is that there may be no fresh birth; therefore I wish not to dwell in this wood; the nature of cessation is different from that of activity.
tannāratirme na parāpacāro vanādito yena parivrajāmi | dharme sthitāḥ pūrvayugānurūpe sarve bhavaṃto hi mahārṣikalpāḥ ||	‘It is not therefore any dislike on my part or the wrong conduct of another, which makes me go away from this wood; for ye are all like great sages, standing fast in the religious duties which are in accordance with former ages.’
tato vacaḥ sūnṛtamarthavacca suślakṣṇamojasvi ca garvitaṃ ca | śrutvā kumārasya tapasvinaste viśeṣayuktaṃ bahumānamīyuḥ ||	Then having heard the prince’s discourse, gracious and of deep meaning, gentle, strong, and full of dignity, the ascetics paid him especial honour.
kaściddvijastatra tu bhasmaśāyī prāṃśuḥ śikhī dāravacīravāsāḥ | āpiṃgalākṣastanudīrghaghoṇaḥ kuṃḍodahasto giramityuvāca ||	But a certain Brāhman who was lying there in the ashes, tall and wearing his hair in a tuft, and clothed in the bark of trees, with reddish eyes and a thin long nose, and carrying a pot with water  in his hand, thus lifted his voice:
dhīmannudāraḥ khalu niścayaste yastvaṃ yuvā janmani dṛṣṭadoṣaḥ | svargāpavargau hi vicārya samyagyasyāpavarge matirasti so 'sti ||	‘O sage, brave indeed is thy purpose, who, young as thou art, hast seen the evils of birth; he who, having pondered thoroughly heaven and liberation, makes up his mind for liberation, — he is indeed brave!
yajñaistapobhirniyamaiśca taistaiḥ svargaṃ yiyāsaṃti hi rāgavaṃtaḥ | rāgeṇa sārdhaṃ ripuṇeva yuddhvā mokṣaṃ parīpsaṃti tu sattvavaṃtaḥ ||	‘By all those various sacrifices, penances and vows the slaves of passion desire to go to heaven; but the strong, having battled with passion as with an enemy, desire to obtain liberation.
tadbuddhireṣā yadi niścitā te tūrṇaṃ bhavān gacchatu viṃdhyakoṣṭham | asau munistatra vasatyarāḍo yo naiṣṭhike śreyasi labdhacakṣuḥ ||	‘If this is thy settled purpose, go quickly to Viṃdhyakoṣṭha; the Muni Arāḍa lives there who has gained an insight into absolute bliss.
tasmādbhavāñchroṣyati tattvamārgaṃ satyāṃ rucau saṃpratipatsyate ca | yathā tu paśyāmi matistavaiṣā tasyāpi yāsyatyavadhūya buddhim ||	‘From him thou wilt hear the path to truth, and if thou hast a desire for it, thou wilt embrace it; but as I foresee, this purpose of thine will go on further, after having rejected his theory.
puṣṭāśvaghoṇaṃ vipulāyatākṣaṃ tāmrādharoṣṭhaṃ sitatīkṣṇadaṃṣṭram | idaṃ hi vaktraṃ tanuraktajihvaṃ jñeyārṇavaṃ pāsyati kṛtsnameva ||	‘With the nose of a well-fed horse, large long eyes, a red lower lip, white sharp teeth, and a thin red tongue, — this face of thine will drink up the entire ocean of what is to be known.
gaṃbhīratā yā bhavatastvagādhā yā dīptatā yāni ca lakṣaṇāni | ācāryakaṃ prāpsyasi tatpṛthivyāṃ yannarṣibhiḥ pūrvayuge 'pyavāptam ||	‘That unfathomed depth which characterises thee, that majesty and all those signs of thine, — they shall win a teacher’s chair in the earth which was never won by sages even in a former age.’
paramamiti tato nṛpātmajastamṛṣijanaṃ pratinaṃdya niryayau | vidhivadanuvidhāya te 'pi taṃ praviviśurāśramiṇastapovanam ||	The prince replied, ‘Very well,’ and having saluted the company of sages he departed; the hermits also having duly performed to him all the rites of courtesy entered again into the ascetic grove.
tatastasmāt purodyānāt kautūhalacalekṣaṇāḥ | pratyujjagmurnṛpasutaṃ prāptaṃ varamiva striyaḥ ||	Then from that city-garden, with their eyes restless in excitement, the women went out to meet the prince as a newly-arrived bridegroom;
abhigamya ca tāstasmai vismayotphullalocanāḥ | cakrire samudācāraṃ padmakośanibhaiḥ karaiḥ ||	And when they came up to him, their eyes wide open in wonder, they performed their due homage with hands folded like a lotus-calyx.
tasthuśca parivāryainaṃ manmathākṣiptacetasaḥ | niścalaiḥ prītivikacaiḥ pibaṃtya iva locanaiḥ ||	Then they stood surrounding him, their minds overpowered by passion, as if they were drinking him in with their eyes motionless and blossoming wide with love.
taṃ hi tā menire nāryaḥ kāmo vigrahavāniti | śobhitaṃ lakṣaṇairdīptaiḥ sahajairbhūṣaṇairiva ||	Some of the women verily thought that he was Kāma incarnate, — decorated as he was with his brilliant signs as with connate ornaments.
saumyatvāccaiva dhairyācca kāścidenaṃ prajajñire | avatīrṇo mahīṃ sākṣād sudhāṃśuścaṃdramā iva ||	Others thought from his gentleness and majesty that it was the moon with its ambrosial beams as it were visibly come down to the earth.
tasya tā vapuṣākṣiptā nirgrahītuṃ jajṛṃbhire | anyonyaṃ dṛṣṭibhirgatvā śanaiśca viniśaśvasuḥ ||	Others, smitten by his beauty, yawned  as if to swallow him, and fixing their eyes on each other, softly sighed.
evaṃ tā dṛṣṭimātreṇa nāryo dadṛśureva tam | na vyājahrurna jahasuḥ prabhāveṇāsya yaṃtritāḥ ||	Thus the women only looked upon him, simply gazing with their eyes, — they spoke not, nor did they smile, controlled by his power.
tāstathā tu nirāraṃbhā dṛṣṭvā praṇayaviklavāḥ | purohitasuto dhīmānudāyī vākyamabravīt ||	But having seen them thus listless, bewildered in their love, the wise son of the family priest, Udāyin, thus addressed them:
sarvāḥ sarvakalājñāḥ stha bhāvagrahaṇapaṃḍitāḥ | rūpacāturyasaṃpannāḥ svaguṇairmukhyatāṃ gatāḥ ||	‘Ye are all skilled in all the graceful arts, proficients in understanding the language of amorous sentiments, possessed of beauty and gracefulness, thorough masters in your own styles.
śobhayata guṇairebhirapi tānuttarān kurūn | kuverasyāpi ca krīḍaṃ prāgeva vasudhāmimām ||	‘With these graces of yours ye may embellish even the Northern Kurus, yea, even the dances  of Kuvera, much more this little earth.
śaktāścālayituṃ yūyaṃ vītarāgānṛṣīnapi | apsarobhiśca kalitān grahītuṃ vibudhānapi ||	‘Ye are able to move even sages who have lost all their desires, and to ensnare even the gods who are charmed by heavenly nymphs.
bhāvajñānena hāvena cāturyādrūpasaṃpadā | strīṇāmeva ca śaktāḥ stha saṃrāge kiṃ punarnṛṇām ||	‘By your skill in expressing the heart’s feelings, by your coquetry, your grace, and your perfect beauty, ye are able to enrapture even women, how much more easily men.
tāsāmevaṃvidhānāṃ vo niyuktānāṃ svagocare | iyamevaṃvidhā ceṣṭā na tuṣṭo 'smyārjavena vaḥ ||	‘You thus skilled as ye are, each set  in her own proper sphere, — such as this is your power, I am not satisfied with your simplicity [when you profess to find him beyond your reach].
idaṃ navavadhūnāṃ vo hrīnikuṃcitacakṣuṣām | sadṛśaṃ ceṣṭitaṃ hi syādapi vā gopayoṣitām ||	‘This timid action of yours would be fit for new brides, their eyes closed through shame, — or it might be a blandishment worthy even of the wives of the cowherds.
yadyapi syādayaṃ vīraḥ śrīprabhāvānmahāniti | strīṇāmapi mahatteja iti kāryo 'tra niścayaḥ ||	‘What though this hero be great by his exalted glory, yet “great is the might of women,” let this be your firm resolve.
purā hi kāśisuṃdaryā veśavadhvā mahānṛṣiḥ | tāḍito 'bhūt padanyāsāddurdharṣo daivatairapi ||	‘In olden time a great seer, hard to be conquered even by the gods, was spurned by a harlot, the beauty of Kāśi, planting her feet upon him.
maṃthālagautamo bhikṣurjaṃghayā bālamukhyayā | piprīṣuśca tadarthārthaṃ vyasūn niraharat purā ||	‘The Bhikṣu Manthālagautama was also formerly spurned by Bālamukhyā with her leg, and wishing to please her he carried out dead bodies for her sake to be buried.
gautamaṃ dīrghatapasaṃ mahārṣiṃ dīrghajīvinam | yoṣit saṃtoṣayāmāsa varṇasthānāvarā satī ||	‘And a woman low in standing and caste fascinated the great seer Gautama, though a master of long penances and old in years.
ṛṣyaśṛṃgaṃ munisutaṃ tathaiva strīṣvapaṃḍitam | upāyairvividhaiḥ śāṃtā jagrāha ca jahāra ca ||	‘So Śāntā  by her various wiles captivated and subdued the sage’s son Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, unskilled in women’s ways.
viśvāmitro maharṣiśca vigāḍho 'pi mahattapāḥ | daśavarṣāṇyaraṇyastho ghṛtācyāpsarasā hṛtaḥ ||	‘And the great seer Viśvāmitra, though plunged in a profound penance,  was carried captive for ten years in the forests by the nymph Ghṛtācī.
evamādīnṛṣīṃstāṃstānanayan vikriyāṃ striyaḥ | lalitaṃ pūrvavayasaṃ kiṃ punarnṛpateḥ sutam ||	‘Many such seers as these have women brought to shame — how much more then a delicate prince in the first flower of his age?
tadevaṃ sati viśrabdhaṃ prayatadhvaṃ tathā yathā | iyaṃ nṛpasya vaṃśaśrīrito na syātparāṅmukhī ||	‘This being so, boldly put forth your efforts that the prosperity of the king’s family may not be turned away from him.
yā hi kāścidyuvatayo haraṃti sadṛśaṃ janam | nikṛṣṭotkṛṣṭayorbhāvaṃ yā gṛhṇaṃti tu tāḥ striyaḥ ||	‘Ordinary women captivate similar lovers; but they are truly women who subdue the natures of high and low.’
ityudāyivacaḥ śrutvā tā viddhā iva yoṣitaḥ | samāruruhurātmānaṃ kumāragrahaṇaṃ prati ||	Having heard these words of Udāyin these women as stung to the heart rose even above themselves for the conquest of the prince.
tā bhrūbhiḥ prekṣitairbhāvairhasitairlalitairgataiḥ | cakrurākṣepikāśceṣṭā bhītabhītā ivāṃganāḥ ||	With their brows, their glances, their coquetries, their smiles, their delicate movements, they made all sorts of significant gestures like women utterly terrified.
rājñastu viniyogena kumārasya ca mārdavāt | jahruḥ kṣipramaviśraṃbhaṃ madena madanena ca ||	But they soon regained their confidence  through the command of the king and the gentle temperament of the prince, and through the power of intoxication and of love.
atha nārījanavṛtaḥ kumāro vyacaradvanam | vāsitāyūthasahitaḥ karīva himavadvanam ||	Then surrounded by troops of women the prince wandered in the wood like an elephant in the forests of Himavat accompanied by a herd of females.
sa tasmin kānane ramye jajvāla strīpuraḥsaraḥ | ākrīḍa iva babhrāje vivasvānapsarovṛtaḥ ||	Attended by the women he shone in that pleasant grove, as the sun surrounded by Apsarasas in his royal garden.
madenāvarjitā nāma taṃ kāścittatra yoṣitaḥ | kaṭhinaiḥ paspṛśuḥ pīnaiḥ saṃghaṭṭairvalgubhiḥ stanaiḥ ||	There some of them, urged by passion, pressed him with their full firm bosoms in gentle collisions.
srastāṃsakomalālaṃbamṛdubāhulatābalā | anṛtaṃ skhalitaṃ kācitkṛtvainaṃ sasvaje balāt ||	Another violently embraced him after making a pretended stumble, — leaning on him with her shoulders drooping down, and with her gentle creeper-like arms dependent.
kācit tāmrādharoṣṭhena mukhenāsavagaṃdhinā | viniśaśvāsa karṇe 'sya rahasyaṃ śrūyatāmiti ||	Another with her mouth smelling of spirituous liquor, her lower lip red like copper, whispered in his ear, ‘Let my secret be heard.’
kācidājñāpayaṃtīva provācārdrānulepanā | iha bhaktiṃ kuruṣveti hastaṃ saṃśliṣya lipsayā ||	Another, all wet with unguents, as if giving him her command, clasped his hand eagerly and said, ‘Perform thy rites of adoration here.’
muhurmuhurmadavyājasrastanīlāṃśukāparā | ālakṣyarasanā reje sphuradvidyudiva kṣapā ||	Another, with her blue garments continually slipping down in pretended intoxication, stood conspicuous with her tongue visible like the night with its lightning flashing.
